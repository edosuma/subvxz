00:22.022 --> 00:23.729
Hey, there you are.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.681
Thomas?

00:25.776 --> 00:26.776
Where have you been?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.067
You said there'd be food.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.394
Real cool party.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.322
Your son is getting "hangry."

00:32.406 --> 00:34.364
Yeah, let's go.
You ready?

00:34.451 --> 00:37.410
Listen up!
Everyone stay right where you are.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.988
All electronic devices
must be unlocked

00:40.082 --> 00:41.493
and handed
over immediately.

00:41.583 --> 00:42.619
Evan, what's going on?

00:42.709 --> 00:44.325
There must've been
a security breach.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.289
- Aaron, what are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.840
Just following orders,
Mr. Myers.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.337
Step back and wait your turn.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.508
Everyone stop talking.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.096
What is going on?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.747
We got a tattoo hit.
There was a data breach

01:02.771 --> 01:05.229
at a national research facility.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.479
Electro Velocity Center or EVC.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.935
They build robotic spacecraft.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.270
It's like real life
Star Wars over there.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.466
Shouldn't this be
an FBI Cyber case?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.482
It was, until we discovered

01:15.576 --> 01:18.319
that one of the stolen files
links to a tattoo.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.620
It's a series of numbers
that connects

01:20.706 --> 01:23.540
to a classified
government project.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.787
So classified they're refusing
to tell us about it.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.163
I'll get us clearance.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.773
In the meantime
we do have a lead.

01:28.797 --> 01:32.290
CSU found this Bluetooth
Transmitter lodged in a pipe.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.876
It paired with
an air-gapped network

01:34.970 --> 01:37.963
of computers
on the 25th floor of EVC.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.094
Someone used this transmitter
to transfer files

01:41.184 --> 01:43.551
to a hard drive that is
still unaccounted for.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.181
We do have a list
of all the people

01:45.272 --> 01:47.000
that were in the building
when the breach occurred.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.437
Apparently EVC was throwing
a 50th anniversary party.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.644
So there are a lot of suspects,
all currently under house arrest.

01:52.738 --> 01:56.231
The devices were confiscated,
so hopefully one of the stolen

01:56.325 --> 01:57.987
files will show up
on one of them.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.658
Okay, let's dig in.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.737
Hey, where are
Jane and Weller?

02:08.502 --> 02:09.960
Look, I know this is hard.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.289
It might help to talk about it.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.125
So, you really didn't know
about my mom?

02:16.219 --> 02:19.337
That she was part of my mother's
terrorist organization?

02:20.015 --> 02:21.881
That is my mother.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.264
I had no idea that your mother
was one of her informants.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.721
I guess it makes sense.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.806
Shepherd was looking
for a way into my life.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.516
My mom was a soft target.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.648
You've never talked
much about your mom.

02:34.738 --> 02:35.774
There's not
much to say.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.981
She's an addict.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.237
She made bad choices.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.944
I cut off contact
years ago.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.904
Has she ever been to rehab?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.364
I offered to pay for it.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.246
Drove her out there myself.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.164
She wouldn't do it.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.626
This is a bad idea,
so we should go.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.255
Wait, look, if it were me,

02:59.346 --> 03:01.508
you would tell me
to not run from my problems.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.181
And that we would get
through this together, right?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.599
Kurt?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.561
Hi.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.727
Hi, Mom.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.572
I just got clearance to open the
stolen classified files from EVC.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.320
Take a look.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.529
All right, so according to this,

03:25.622 --> 03:29.206
EVC launched a satellite
last week that... Oh, my God.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.292
Can this be right?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.584
What? What is it?

03:31.670 --> 03:34.128
EVC weaponized a satellite.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.831
It's equipped with live missiles
that can be launched from space.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.361
It's real life Star Wars,
just like I said.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.737
Wait, does that make us
the Rebels or the Empire?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.468
Is there a specific target?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.921
Uh...

03:43.014 --> 03:45.347
According to this, no.
It's still in its

03:45.434 --> 03:48.268
testing phase but it is
fully operational.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.562
Uh, guys, I just skipped ahead
to the really bad part.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.310
The files that
were stolen last night

03:53.400 --> 03:55.813
contain the launch codes
for these missiles.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.235
Which means whoever has them
can launch a nuclear strike

03:58.321 --> 04:00.859
on any country they choose.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.065
With no way to stop it.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.341
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.466
I had to convince my boss that
a surprise visit from my son

04:24.556 --> 04:28.766
and his beautiful wife was worth
a five-minute break.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.593
We need to ask you
some questions.

04:30.687 --> 04:35.432
Oh, honey, humor me with a
little small talk first, please.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.482
We're not here
to socialize, Mom.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.061
Uh, Mrs. Weller...

04:40.155 --> 04:41.566
No, no, call me Linda.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.863
We're family.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.274
Do you know this woman?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.280
Yeah, that's Ellen.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.531
Why do you...
why do you...

04:48.622 --> 04:49.783
When did you meet her?

04:49.873 --> 04:51.284
Five years ago, maybe?

04:51.374 --> 04:54.287
Time gets a little fuzzy
as you get older.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.666
Uh, can you tell us a little bit
more about your relationship?

04:57.756 --> 04:59.247
Yeah. We met at a bar.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.003
We talked until
they closed it up

05:01.092 --> 05:03.334
and they kicked us out.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.044
From then on we...
we've been friends.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.713
That's the story
you're gonna go with?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.925
Well, it's...
it's the truth.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.135
Ellen and I had
a lot in common.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.097
Your "friend" Ellen...

05:15.190 --> 05:16.977
was a terrorist
named Shepherd.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.103
I don't understand.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.402
Linda, she wasn't just having

05:21.488 --> 05:24.196
innocent heart-to-heart
talks with you.

05:24.282 --> 05:28.447
Shepherd was cultivating you as
an asset to gain intel on Kurt.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.155
That's you entering a building

05:33.250 --> 05:35.708
which is known to be part
of Shepherd's terrorist cell.

05:35.794 --> 05:39.128
You entered that
building using a key.

05:39.214 --> 05:42.002
- I can explain that.
- Okay.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.584
A couple of weeks ago
I got a... um...

05:44.678 --> 05:46.965
an envelope from Ellen's lawyer.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.514
And inside it was a key
and a letter

05:50.600 --> 05:52.683
telling me to go to that
building and pick up

05:52.769 --> 05:54.886
some money
she left me in her will.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.721
This was Shepherd's plan.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.976
She gave both of us keys.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.648
She wanted us
to find each other.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.727
Oh...

06:02.821 --> 06:04.858
Uh, um, I, I should...

06:04.948 --> 06:07.031
I should get back to work.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.612
Can I help you?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.786
You're in my way, chief.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.285
Actually, I'm not a chief.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.494
I'm a special agent.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.042
You should flash
that thing at her.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.494
She's the real criminal.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.084
Guess I'll come back
another time.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.682
What have you gotten
yourself into this time?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.732
Hey, did you hear?
Weller and Jane

06:41.818 --> 06:43.184
are back with his mom.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.881
Trying to stop an imminent
nuclear threat.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.238
Don't really have time
to gossip right now.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.690
What, did they arrest her?

06:48.783 --> 06:49.844
She wasn't in cuffs
when they brought her

06:49.868 --> 06:50.868
into the conference room.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.160
- This is really, really bad.
- No, I know.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.350
Kurt really didn't luck out
in the parenting department.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.785
No, uh, I was referring to this.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.040
I just finished going
through the data

07:01.129 --> 07:03.712
on the last device
confiscated from the EVC party.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.318
The stolen files
aren't on any of them.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.715
So they didn't
stop the breach.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.884
Oh, I see how
that's problematic.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.882
What do you got?

07:11.556 --> 07:14.390
Uh, the launch codes
to an armed

07:14.476 --> 07:17.310
and very dangerous satellite
were stolen last night.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.762
That thing deploys
missiles from space?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.667
It's called an
Orbital Strike Satellite.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.308
Created in complete
secrecy by a company

07:24.402 --> 07:27.145
called Electro Velocity Center,
along with the DOD.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.981
We're trying to figure out
which of the 100 plus people

07:30.075 --> 07:32.658
in the building
stole the launch codes.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.282
But so far the stolen files
aren't on any of the devices.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.292
The thief could've swallowed
a small flash drive.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.161
That's true,
one time I ingested

07:39.250 --> 07:41.082
half million dollars'
worth of Bitcoin.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.396
Let's just say the return
on that particular

07:42.420 --> 07:44.207
investment was sub-optimal.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.710
I'd hide the flash drive
inside the building,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.463
wait until the heat dies down,
then sneak it out that way.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.838
I'll send teams back to EVC.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.795
I'll work my old CIA channels.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.632
All right, we'll check the dark
web for any possible sales.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.307
Hey, we got this
under control.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.306
You should get back
to your mom and Jane.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.729
All right.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.779
Wanna sit down?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.151
Jason knows you're a fed.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.155
He's gonna think
I'm ratting him out.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.953
So, Jason, he said that
I should arrest you.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.280
Why?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.708
Linda, we want to help you.

08:22.794 --> 08:26.333
But we need to know
what's going on.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.712
A few years ago,
I had a fall.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.918
I ended up in the hospital.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.799
The doctor prescribed Oxycontin.

08:34.889 --> 08:39.429
When the prescription ended,
I was still in pain.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.121
I had to find another way
to get the pills.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.808
That's when I met Jason.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.977
So he's your dealer.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.601
Oxy isn't cheap.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.604
I ran up a debt with Jason

08:47.694 --> 08:48.935
and I couldn't pay him back.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.488
He said if I made
a simple delivery for him,

08:52.574 --> 08:55.112
then we'd be even.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.737
So you're a drug mule?

08:56.828 --> 08:59.070
- Kurt.
- No, no...

08:59.164 --> 09:01.747
That's the problem.
I couldn't go through with it.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.543
I was so scared and I thought
the police were following me.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.621
So I... I dumped the pills
at a rest stop.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.132
How much do you owe him?

09:13.178 --> 09:14.635
$100,000.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.098
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.347
Why don't you go to rehab?
Commit to getting sober.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.848
- I want to.
- Yeah.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.099
No, I do.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.807
But I have to pay Jason back.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.381
What, so you're
gonna make it in tips?

09:30.695 --> 09:32.687
Is there, um...
is there a restroom?

09:37.994 --> 09:41.658
Alex, escort this
lady to the restroom.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.489
Don't let her
out of your sight.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.825
I don't need a chaperone, Kurt.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.248
I say that you do.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.513
That woman... has put
me through so much pain.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.885
My entire life.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.342
Well, you have every
right to be angry.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.099
But, Kurt, she's in danger.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.682
And she's family.
We can't just turn our backs on her.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.892
Fine.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.022
So, I'll call
the office in Philly.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.113
See if they can get this Jason
guy off the streets.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.405
Stop him being a threat.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.198
I'll take Linda
to our apartment.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.991
Get a protective detail on her.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.912
It'll buy us some time to
figure out our next steps.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.323
It's gonna be okay.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.628
All right, just heard from the
team at EVC headquarters.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.081
So far Weller's theory
of the hard drive

10:34.175 --> 10:35.962
being hidden there
is not panning out.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.947
Okay, well,
we're doing a little bit better over here.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.032
Ten employees swiped their ID
badges in the restricted area

10:40.056 --> 10:42.673
within the hour before the
launch codes were stolen.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.036
Agent Woods is
tracking them down.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.700
Uh, why is Agent Woods
tracking them down?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.810
'Cause I have something very
concerning to tell you.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.564
Uh, more concerning than
weaponized satellites?

10:50.650 --> 10:51.650
Well, you tell me.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.522
I set up a federal inmate
notification app on my phone.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.853
Yeah, there's
an app for that.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.485
And I just got
an alert about Kathy.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.157
Like, our Kathy?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.280
Yes, our Kathy,
Kathy Gustafson.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.986
Kathy the...

11:04.080 --> 11:07.244
Kathy was a part of an elite
three-person hacker team.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.246
Three Blind Mice
reunited again.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.668
This woman is crazy.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.245
You're not
a very good friend.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.672
Ahh!

11:15.758 --> 11:17.966
Kathy Gustafson,
you're under arrest.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.168
She's out of prison.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.130
- She has, like, five years left on her sentence.
- Early parole.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.243
It doesn't say how she got out.
Just says that she's out.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.725
Do you think that she used
us as bargaining chips?

11:26.811 --> 11:28.664
- Don't jump to conclusions.
- It's not jumping.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.291
When I was in prison
I ratted on everybody.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.601
I mean, can you blame her?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.127
Geez, we did all those
early hacks together.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.587
She's the only one
that did any prison time.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.853
Yeah... do you ever
feel bad about that?

11:36.946 --> 11:39.506
Well, I mean, she did kidnap and
put shock collars on us and then

11:39.574 --> 11:42.032
tried to shoot me so it's not
exactly keeping me up at night.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.721
But if she tells anybody that
we're the other two-thirds

11:43.745 --> 11:44.972
of Three Blind Mice,
do you know

11:44.996 --> 11:47.079
what's gonna happen to...
Hey, Agent Woods!

11:47.165 --> 11:49.077
Hi! Uh!

11:49.167 --> 11:51.204
Oh, you are quick and quiet.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.830
How can I help you?

11:52.921 --> 11:53.939
So I ran all the
names on the list.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.295
And everyone
was accounted for

11:55.381 --> 11:57.714
except for a senior VP
named Evan Myers.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.171
What do you mean,
accounted for?

12:00.261 --> 12:03.220
Evan Myers got special permission
to have his house arrest lifted

12:03.306 --> 12:05.673
so that he could give
a presentation at EVC HQ

12:05.767 --> 12:07.053
and he never showed up.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.931
We spoke to Evan's wife
and she said that Evan

12:10.021 --> 12:12.388
left home this morning
with their son Thomas.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.644
He was supposed to drop
him off at school,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.145
but Thomas never made it.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.353
You think Evan's on the run.
Why take his kid?

12:18.446 --> 12:19.812
Seems like a major liability.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.398
Yeah, well, we thought so, too
until we found this.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.404
Thomas is a diabetic,
and last year

12:24.494 --> 12:27.487
he got a new insulin pump
and it's super high-tech.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.991
Does it store data?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.618
A small amount, but yes.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.103
It's also Bluetooth compatible.
And the kid was at the party.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.210
It's gotta be the hard drive
that we're looking for.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.084
Evan must've known that security
wouldn't confiscate a medical device.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.756
Just got off the phone
with Keaton.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.255
CIA caught chatter between
a few Russian operatives.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.945
They were talking
about obtaining control

12:43.972 --> 12:45.783
of a weaponized satellite
from one of their assets.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.923
There's your asset.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.702
If the Russians get a hold
of those launch codes...

12:48.726 --> 12:51.514
They'll have the power to
decimate any country they want.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.461
We need to know
where Evan's headed next.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.754
If he's a foreign agent,
he's gotta have

12:58.778 --> 13:00.130
some trace
on his devices somewhere.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.396
We just cracked
his cloud drive.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.106
Looks like he deleted
a ton of data

13:04.200 --> 13:06.533
from his laptop last night,
or tried to.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.578
We recovered a Word doc with a
bunch of dates and times on it,

13:09.664 --> 13:11.464
and the initials "NB"
next to a bunch of them.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.035
Yeah, we'll
cross-reference that

13:13.126 --> 13:14.867
with his calendar
and phone records.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.702
Have you heard
from Evan's wife yet?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.833
Weller's heading to Jersey
to talk to her now.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.043
Oh, yeah, Weller's mom's
over at their apartment, huh?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.751
I eavesdrop a little bit.
Eh, so sue me.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.614
What, nobody wants to talk
about Weller's mom but me?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.865
No, we're busy trying
to save the world

13:26.889 --> 13:28.300
from an orbital strike
satellite.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.478
The last time
I saw Kurt this happy

13:38.568 --> 13:41.481
it was Christmas morning,
when he was nine.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.355
I missed his whole life.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.198
Look...

13:47.285 --> 13:48.617
You wanna know

13:48.703 --> 13:50.410
how I could
abandon my children.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.453
How I could leave them
with their father

13:52.540 --> 13:55.954
when I knew
he was a monster.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.521
I... I don't have the right
to ask you that...

13:57.545 --> 13:59.332
That's right,
you don't know my life.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.459
Any more than
I know my son's.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.709
I'm sorry.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.010
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have...

14:07.096 --> 14:08.712
None of... none of this
is your fault.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.173
You should go
be with Kurt.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.179
I... I'll be fine here.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.349
Um...

14:18.274 --> 14:20.391
Why don't I
make us some tea?

14:23.780 --> 14:26.898
Can I offer you coffee, tea?
Do you want water or...

14:26.991 --> 14:28.857
Um, I'm fine.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.988
I do have to ask you
some questions

14:31.079 --> 14:32.119
about your husband,
though.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.242
Okay, do you wanna sit or...

14:34.332 --> 14:36.915
I can't believe that
he would kidnap our son.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.412
Thomas is... is diabetic.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.210
Uh, he could go into
insulin shock.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.413
We know, an AMBER alert
has already been put out.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.793
Okay.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.169
Do you recall your husband

14:45.259 --> 14:47.797
acting strangely
in the past few days?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.095
No, he always works
long hours.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.639
Takes calls
late at night, uh...

14:52.725 --> 14:54.432
He said he was working
on a big project,

14:54.519 --> 14:55.680
but... now I'm worried,

14:55.770 --> 14:58.137
and I don't know
what I'm worried about.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.563
None of this
makes any sense.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.732
I understand.
Now, about last night

15:01.818 --> 15:03.309
at the company party.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.895
Did you see Evan go up
to the 25th floor at all?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.524
Not that I can remember.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.948
Did he leave
you and Thomas alone?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.991
It was a work party,
I mean, he was...

15:12.078 --> 15:14.365
talking to people, and I'm...
I'm just the spouse.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.162
I... I... He, um...

15:16.249 --> 15:18.457
He's a good man.
He's a good dad.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.543
He's... he's...

15:19.585 --> 15:21.542
I'm sorry, I...
I want to help.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.790
I... I'm not helping.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.872
- No... yes, you are.
- Okay.

15:24.966 --> 15:25.966
You're doing great.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.250
Would you know
anywhere that...

15:28.344 --> 15:29.551
Evan could have
taken Thomas?

15:29.637 --> 15:32.129
Their passports
are missing, so...

15:32.223 --> 15:35.136
Canada? He has some
business contacts there.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.559
I'll alert Border Patrol.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.012
And a security detail
already on your home.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.972
Could you just please
bring my son home?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.352
Because...

15:43.443 --> 15:45.685
I can't live
without him, so...

15:46.904 --> 15:48.941
I'll do my best, ma'am.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.864
- Hey, boss.
- Is there something you two wanna tell me?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.489
If you're suggesting
I know where all

15:55.580 --> 15:57.099
the missing rubber gloves
are, you're mistaken.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.392
That's not what
I'm talking about.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.768
That's not what
anyone's talking about.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.853
There's been
a cyber attack.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.396
Every member of
the New England National Bank

16:02.420 --> 16:03.786
has received an email
alerting them

16:03.880 --> 16:05.520
that their bank
has been committing fraud.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.256
And the message
was signed with a logo

16:08.342 --> 16:10.584
from The Three Blind Mice.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.010
What is that?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.837
What is that?
Are you kidding me?

16:13.931 --> 16:15.388
Talk! Now.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.091
Okay.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.974
Kathy was released
this morning, early parole.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.225
And you didn't think
to mention that to me?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.751
- I wanted to, but she said we should let...
- You told me!

16:26.819 --> 16:28.276
We arrested Kathy...

16:28.362 --> 16:30.524
and I thought
the Three Blind Mice was over.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.509
I was willing to overlook
your prior involvement.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.071
But now I'm finding out your
hacker group is active again?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.527
- No!
- No. No, no, it's...

16:36.621 --> 16:38.661
No, no, no, we didn't have
anything to do with this.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.618
If Kathy did this,
she acted alone.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.074
Or it's
a copycat group.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.329
Hey, "cat," "mouse"...

16:43.419 --> 16:44.785
there's a joke
in there somewhere.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.064
I don't need jokes,
I need answers, Rich.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.920
The EVC case takes
top priority,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.007
but I need this New England
National hack resolved,

16:50.092 --> 16:52.196
or we're all gonna have
to answer for Three Blind Mice.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.677
- You understand?
- Yeah.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.345
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.757
Oh, my God.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.600
Hey, relax.
We can fix this.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.302
I... know we can.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.637
That's not
what this is.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.313
When we started
working with Kathy,

17:05.398 --> 17:06.919
I thought we were doing
something noble,

17:06.943 --> 17:08.775
but we were actually
just breaking the law!

17:08.861 --> 17:11.131
Okay, Reade's not gonna tank his
job and then go to jail with us,

17:11.155 --> 17:12.925
just because of a little
harmless, white hat hacking.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.315
I mean, come on... hey, look!

17:14.407 --> 17:16.069
It's like Grand Central
Station in here!

17:16.160 --> 17:17.680
Evan Myers made
six payments last month

17:17.744 --> 17:19.452
to somebody called
Lloyd Hamerstein,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.326
a licensed private detective.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.998
If Evan had access
to Russian intelligence,

17:24.085 --> 17:27.624
why would he pay
a low-rent PI?

17:27.713 --> 17:30.000
Maybe he was trying to get
some dirt on his handlers.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.444
I mean, if he thought that people
were trying to blackmail him,

17:32.468 --> 17:35.006
maybe he wanted to settle the score,
you know? Swip-swap?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.890
Evan's car was just
spotted at a gas station

17:39.976 --> 17:41.842
in Middleton, New York.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.269
20 on 6.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.354
Dad, I gotta pee.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.437
Okay. Uh, come on.
It's back there.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.564
I can go by myself.
I'm not a baby.

17:51.654 --> 17:55.523
Fine. Okay. I'll get the car
and I'll pull up.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.823
Don't dawdle.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.753
Hey.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.125
Where's the kid?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.359
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.045
Do I, uh...

18:14.135 --> 18:15.797
Do I know you?

18:18.306 --> 18:19.592
Uhh! Ohh!

18:19.682 --> 18:21.344
Dad!

18:26.939 --> 18:29.056
Evan Myers just got shot
at a gas station

18:29.150 --> 18:31.392
and is now in surgery.
He's in critical condition.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.976
What about
his son Thomas?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.902
He fled from the scene
and is still missing.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.231
We have multiple teams
searching the area now.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.719
The guy who shot Evan
got away, but not before

18:38.743 --> 18:41.156
getting his face on
their surveillance camera.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.363
According to my CIA contact,
that is Nikolai Berlinsky,

18:44.457 --> 18:45.538
a known Russian operative.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.412
"NB." Those are the initials

18:47.501 --> 18:49.663
on the documents that Evan
tried to delete last night.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.746
Maybe Evan was chronicling
their meetings.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.025
Nikolai could have
been Evan's handler.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.165
But if that's the case,

18:54.258 --> 18:55.978
why shoot his asset
before the deal is done?

18:56.010 --> 18:58.377
Maybe Evan got cold feet,
tried to call it off.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.671
Or he got greedy and he wanted
more money for the codes.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.891
Look at that.
Nikolai...

19:04.977 --> 19:07.640
He runs inside
straight after the shooting.

19:07.730 --> 19:08.846
So he's after Thomas.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.100
He must have known
those codes

19:10.191 --> 19:11.853
were hidden
on his insulin pump.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.184
So the Russians could have
Thomas and the codes already.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.816
Have we got
any other leads?

19:16.906 --> 19:18.613
It's a bit of
a waiting game right now,

19:18.699 --> 19:21.237
but I have my system
searching street cams

19:21.327 --> 19:24.946
and CCTV footage for any signs
of Nikolai and Thomas.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.392
And we're still looking into the
private detective Evan was paying.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.123
I sent agents over
to his home and office.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.076
Send me his info.
I'll stay on top of it.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.106
Rich, Patterson, focus on
the New England National hack.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.712
Weitz is all on me about it.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.109
The stock markets close
in a few hours,

19:36.133 --> 19:37.795
and bank stocks
are taking a beating.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.376
All right!
One for all, huh?

19:39.470 --> 19:40.927
All... all for...

19:41.013 --> 19:42.629
Nobody wants
to do... that,

19:42.723 --> 19:43.839
it seems.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.221
Psst! Hey.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.955
Any luck connecting Kathy
to the bank hack?

19:48.979 --> 19:50.766
Eh, you could
say that.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.563
Unfortunately, it also
connects us to it.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.812
Look at this little message
she left for us.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.109
K plus P plus R

19:56.195 --> 19:59.609
equals Best Friends
Forever "4 EVA."

19:59.699 --> 20:01.343
It's a little redundant,
but that's clearly from her.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.279
But she was right
about the bank fraud.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.281
So turns out
New England National

20:05.371 --> 20:07.909
created 2.5 million
credit card accounts

20:07.998 --> 20:09.393
without their customers'
permission,

20:09.417 --> 20:12.251
which incurred
close to $4 million in fees.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.328
So she exposed corruption
on a massive scale?

20:14.422 --> 20:16.539
That's pretty on-brand
for Three Blind Mice.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.089
Except that she
broke her parole

20:18.175 --> 20:19.382
and committed
a federal crime.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.710
Okay, I'm going to quote
someone very wise

20:21.804 --> 20:23.716
that I once knew...
"Keyboard vigilantes

20:23.806 --> 20:26.048
must sacrifice themselves
for the greater good."

20:26.142 --> 20:27.474
- I said that...
- Ah!

20:27.560 --> 20:29.392
...when I thought I was
retiring from the FBI

20:29.478 --> 20:31.498
and when I didn't realize
we were working with a lunatic!

20:31.522 --> 20:33.138
Okay. All right.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.766
Okay.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.692
Look at this.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.565
Uh, this
Three Blind Mice logo

20:39.655 --> 20:41.021
that Kathy used
to sign the email.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.357
It's different from the one
we used back in the day.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.989
What? Is it another
hidden message?

20:46.078 --> 20:48.070
"Did you ever see
such a sight in your life

20:48.164 --> 20:49.655
as Three Blind Mice."

20:49.749 --> 20:51.435
Wait a second,
some of the letters have little lines

20:51.459 --> 20:53.145
and some of them don't...
is that something?

20:53.169 --> 20:56.412
If we put each of the letters
in groups of three...

20:56.505 --> 20:57.586
it's trinary code.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.084
Trinary code.
Three Blind Mice.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.882
Come on, we gotta
admire the creativity.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.631
Each grouping solves
to a number...

21:03.721 --> 21:07.055
which corresponds to
a letter in the alphabet.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.758
And that gives us...

21:09.852 --> 21:11.514
"Thirty Dewey Nine B."

21:15.274 --> 21:16.731
Okay...

21:16.817 --> 21:19.275
Okay, okay.
There is a 30 Dewey Street

21:19.361 --> 21:20.568
in the financial district.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.361
Is Kathy telling us
where to find her?

21:22.448 --> 21:23.984
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.820
Patterson! Rich!

21:29.914 --> 21:34.500
Ohh, my two favorite pals
in the whole wide world!

21:34.585 --> 21:37.043
Is that... true still?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.870
Are... Are we just
coming inside?

21:38.964 --> 21:40.080
I'll get the door.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.131
I knew you'd
decode my message.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.675
And in record time.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.844
Doesn't it feel great
to be reunited again?

21:45.930 --> 21:48.843
I missed you guys so much.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.095
I like your... haircut.
Did you do that yourself?

21:51.185 --> 21:54.349
Uh, Kathy, this is actually
not a... a social call.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.645
You hacked a bank today.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.439
And exposed major
corporate corruption.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.062
That's what we do, right?

22:00.152 --> 22:01.505
Ehh, you might wanna
pump the brakes

22:01.529 --> 22:02.861
on the whole "we" thing.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.529
I mean, we had nothing
to do with this.

22:04.615 --> 22:07.107
It was you,
acting... alone.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.318
What am I
looking at here?

22:09.411 --> 22:13.951
Welcome to your
bridal party fitting!

22:14.041 --> 22:15.282
To our what now?

22:15.376 --> 22:16.492
I'm getting married.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.702
And I want you to be
my bridesmaids.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.833
Will you? Say yes!

22:20.923 --> 22:22.710
You just got out of prison

22:22.800 --> 22:25.463
just this morning,
and you're already engaged.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.261
I got it, you fell
in love with a guard...

22:28.347 --> 22:30.464
no, the warden...
and they pulled some strings,

22:30.558 --> 22:32.077
and that's why you're
out of prison early?

22:32.101 --> 22:35.845
I got out on good behavior.
And not a moment too soon.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.850
My passion pastry and I

22:37.940 --> 22:41.274
finally got to hug and kiss
for the first time today.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.776
I can't wait for you
to meet him.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.525
I am sure he is

22:45.614 --> 22:47.822
a real catch, Kathy.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.366
- I... w-we are so happy for you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.284
But you committed
a crime today.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.328
But nobody has
to know about that.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.895
Unfortunately, the cat's kind of
out of the bag on that already.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.622
Hey, cat... cat and mice.
Remember earlier when I...

22:59.712 --> 23:00.897
I've been saying cat
and then mice...

23:00.921 --> 23:01.921
We have to take you in.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.588
No, please,
don't do that.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.836
I hated prison so much.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.589
If you guys
sent me back there,

23:08.679 --> 23:10.386
I'd have to tell everyone

23:10.472 --> 23:12.259
that you were
my accomplices in this,

23:12.349 --> 23:16.218
and... all the other
old stuff we did.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.474
But you don't wanna do that,
do you?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.812
Okay! Now that
that's settled,

23:22.902 --> 23:25.690
let's try on
these wedding duds.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.899
After Taylor Shaw
went missing,

23:30.993 --> 23:32.905
I knew I had to get us
away from Bill.

23:32.995 --> 23:36.033
I tried to take
my children with me.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.580
- You did?
- Yeah.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.658
Kurt... Kurt never
mentioned that.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.209
I don't think
he remembers.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.502
Ah.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.921
I planned our escape
for weeks.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.171
I waited for Bill
to drink himself to sleep.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.923
Then I woke up the kids.

23:51.013 --> 23:54.177
And then we... hitched
a ride to a shelter.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.266
We don't... we don't have

23:55.351 --> 23:56.411
to talk about this
if you don't want.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.971
I want to.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.099
I guess
I... I was still asleep

24:00.189 --> 24:02.306
when Kurt woke up
later that night.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.482
He was scared.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.776
He found the woman
who was in charge,

24:06.862 --> 24:09.821
so she let him
call his dad.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.773
Kurt didn't understand
why you were there.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.950
Well, how do you tell
a 10-year-old kid

24:14.036 --> 24:17.200
you think his father
is a murderer?

24:17.289 --> 24:20.873
Bill said that he was
going to kill all of us

24:20.960 --> 24:25.170
if I even looked like I might
take his kids away again.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.419
That's why you left,
to protect them.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.751
I swore to myself
I would come back for them.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.335
So what stopped you?

24:32.429 --> 24:34.216
Oh, first it was Bill.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.299
What he said he would do.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.680
And then later,
it was just... me.

24:39.770 --> 24:43.684
'Cause of my own addictions,
my weakness.

24:43.774 --> 24:47.142
Bill kept his demons
on the inside.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.728
But somehow, mine...

24:49.822 --> 24:51.654
just all got out.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.073
And I didn't want them
around that.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.823
Something tells me
you know about that.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.077
Having demons.

25:03.961 --> 25:04.961
Yeah.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.129
Uh, speaking of which...

25:08.215 --> 25:11.834
I don't suppose you have
anything that's... stronger.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.129
Why don't we, uh,
stick to tea for now.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.758
I'll put on another pot.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.392
- I...
- Oh...

25:25.482 --> 25:27.974
my goodness, this thing
fits like a glove.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.856
What color is this?
Tonsil? Tongue?

25:30.946 --> 25:33.188
Dog's Tongue.
Whoopee Cushion.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.114
How did Kathy get all
my sizes so perfectly?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.281
- Hey.
- Look at thi...

25:36.368 --> 25:37.859
- Can we focus for a second?
- Yeah.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.222
We have to figure out
what to do.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.453
We have
to arrest her, right?

25:40.539 --> 25:41.539
Right.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.455
Oh, Rich.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.158
You look fabulous.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.584
I do, don't I?

25:46.670 --> 25:48.457
Patterson, yours needs
a little work.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.209
- Oh... yeah.
- Ooh.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.665
Hey, listen, um,

25:51.759 --> 25:53.716
I was thinking, you know,

25:53.802 --> 25:55.155
since you're
getting married now...

25:55.179 --> 25:56.841
new man, new chapter...

25:56.930 --> 25:58.341
what about like
a fresh, new start?

25:58.432 --> 26:01.641
No more hacking,
no more breaking your parole.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.686
No more, uh, you know,
crimes of... of any sort.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.139
- That is a great idea.
- Yeah.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.316
Unfortunately,
weddings are so expensive,

26:10.402 --> 26:12.394
and, well, they
don't pay you much

26:12.488 --> 26:15.856
when you're sitting in prison
protecting your friends.

26:15.949 --> 26:18.111
- Hmm.
- We set up a funding page,

26:18.202 --> 26:20.194
but so far,
no one's donated.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.698
Ah.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.371
Oh... well...

26:23.457 --> 26:26.746
I would... I would love
to contribute.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.293
Would, say...

26:29.379 --> 26:30.915
$10,000 be enough?

26:31.006 --> 26:32.747
Sure, for the DJ.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.503
My dream wedding budget

26:34.593 --> 26:36.710
is more in
the 10 million range.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.511
10 million?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.179
Oh, boy,
that is a dream.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.599
Patterson, this is
a celebration of life

26:43.685 --> 26:47.474
after I lost years of mine
rotting away in a concrete box

26:47.564 --> 26:50.227
while you guys walked around
free as foxes.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.354
Free as f... foxes?
Is that...

26:52.444 --> 26:54.026
I've never heard
that expression before.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.173
Is that like
a prison thing or...

26:55.197 --> 26:56.438
What if...

26:56.532 --> 26:59.149
were were to give you
200 grand...

26:59.243 --> 27:00.363
to never commit
another crime

27:00.410 --> 27:02.447
or reveal
the true identities

27:02.538 --> 27:03.904
of the other two
Blind Mice?

27:03.997 --> 27:07.035
Deal. 200 each.

27:07.126 --> 27:10.290
And you can donate
at KathysDreamWedding.com.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.538
Hey, hey, hey.
Wizardville.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.248
I don't have 200 large

27:15.342 --> 27:16.753
just sittin' around,
you know.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.585
I gotta... move around
some cryptocurrencies

27:18.679 --> 27:20.762
and maybe, um,
access some assets

27:20.848 --> 27:22.464
I haven't told
the FBI about yet.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.618
And I don't even
have all my passwords,

27:23.642 --> 27:24.642
so I can't do this today.

27:24.726 --> 27:25.829
That's fine, just
pay me back later.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.219
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, sure.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.349
Hey, Kathy...

27:29.439 --> 27:31.977
we're not gonna be able
to make it to your wedding.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.603
But I didn't tell you
when it is.

27:33.694 --> 27:34.855
Oh, when is it?

27:34.945 --> 27:35.903
Next spring.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.486
- Ah...
- Or winter.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.530
Ugh. That's...

27:39.616 --> 27:40.802
We're not gonna
be able to make it.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.158
Yeah. I mean,
not physically,

27:42.244 --> 27:43.655
but we will be there
in spirit.

27:43.745 --> 27:46.203
Yeah.
"BFFs forevah," right?

27:46.290 --> 27:48.327
Here we go,
it's, uh...

27:49.501 --> 27:51.037
Here it is.

27:51.128 --> 27:52.994
So enjoy your...
happily ever after.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.330
Yeah. Who's the DJ?

27:57.551 --> 27:58.792
Hey! What do you got?

27:58.886 --> 28:00.486
Oh, wow, that feels cool
to be walking in

28:00.512 --> 28:01.719
from the field
for a change.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.324
Don't get used to it.
You guys find Kathy?

28:03.348 --> 28:05.089
Uh... it's complicated.
We'll explain later.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.391
How's it going
over here?

28:06.476 --> 28:08.012
You gonna catch
this Berlinsky guy

28:08.103 --> 28:09.743
before he launches a
missile at us or what?

28:09.771 --> 28:11.558
I just tracked
down the PI Evan hired.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.710
He says he was paid to follow
Evan's wife Scarlett for 30 days.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.191
He's about to send over
photos now.

28:15.277 --> 28:16.563
Jeez, talk about
trust issues.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.339
Another reason why the social
construct of marriage

28:18.363 --> 28:19.979
is designed to drive
people insane.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.217
Uh, you drive
all of us insane,

28:21.241 --> 28:22.510
and none of us
are married to you.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.196
Spoken like a true
work wife. Tck!

28:25.370 --> 28:26.861
All right, here we go.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.911
Hey... is that
who I think it is?

28:31.001 --> 28:32.458
Nikolai Berlinsky.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.001
Why is Scarlett
meeting with him?

28:34.087 --> 28:35.919
According to
the PI's notes...

28:36.006 --> 28:37.998
she met with him
a few times a week.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.378
It isn't Evan that's
working with the Russians.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.835
It's his wife.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.262
Scarlett was the one that stole
the launch codes from EVC.

28:44.348 --> 28:45.909
Then,
after the data breach happened,

28:45.933 --> 28:48.141
Evan must have realized
that his wife was the thief.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.718
Well, why didn't he
go to the police?

28:49.811 --> 28:50.914
Because all the
evidence leads to him.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.679
So Scarlett
used his key card

28:52.773 --> 28:54.730
to get up to the 25th floor
during the party...

28:54.816 --> 28:56.307
to set him up.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.233
He didn't kidnap his son.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.146
He was protecting him
from his own mother.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.967
Patterson, call the agents
at Scarlett's house.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.232
Have 'em arrest her now.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.783
<i>Dad said I can't go home.</i>

29:05.869 --> 29:08.282
Thomas, calm down.
It'll be okay.

29:08.372 --> 29:09.829
And then he got shot.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.559
- Where are you now?
<i>- Dad said if we got separated</i>

29:11.583 --> 29:13.770
to go to the place where
we watched fireworks last year.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.626
Okay, don't
say anything else.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.874
I will meet you there.
I love you.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.206
Love you, too, Mom.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.565
Our stay-at-home mom
turned Russian spy

29:37.651 --> 29:38.651
has some serious moves...

29:38.735 --> 29:40.226
she spiked
our agents' lemonade

29:40.320 --> 29:41.686
and fled.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.067
Yeah. This was just after
Thomas called her.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.900
We have it on tape. He said
he was going somewhere safe.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.701
A place where
they used to watch fireworks.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.450
And... Scarlett is on her way
to meet him there now.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.184
Does the kid have a cell phone
that we can track?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.353
No,
he borrowed one from a man in Woodstock.

29:55.377 --> 29:56.897
So the Russians,
they don't have Thomas

29:56.962 --> 29:58.064
and they don't have
the codes yet.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.483
But there is a lot of places they
can watch fireworks up there.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.920
Exactly... we pulled
the family social media...

30:03.010 --> 30:05.172
texts, phone records,
calendar apps.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.629
There's nothing about
Woodstock or fireworks.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.261
Yeah, and no one in the immediate
family owns property there.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.744
Police are still
searching the area,

30:11.768 --> 30:13.430
but so far...
there's no sign of Thomas.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.512
- So we're at a dead end.
- Maybe not.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.267
Evan will be out
of surgery any minute.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.252
He's the only one that knows
where his son is going to be.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.938
What if we sped up
his recovery?

30:21.028 --> 30:22.314
Forced him to wake up?

30:22.404 --> 30:23.861
- Yeah.
- Can we do that?

30:23.947 --> 30:25.438
You mean technically
or ethically?

30:25.532 --> 30:28.115
Because we can bring a patient
out of general anesthesia

30:28.201 --> 30:29.783
using extremely high
doses of Ritalin,

30:29.870 --> 30:32.578
but that's...
an experimental procedure.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.075
How experimental
are we talking?

30:34.166 --> 30:35.748
I mean,
a lot experimental.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.541
So we'd be
risking his life.

30:37.627 --> 30:38.868
Evan would want us
to do it.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.732
I mean, he's already taken so
many risks to save his son.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.588
- Why stop now?
- Morally, it's a gray area.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.461
But... it's all we got.
Wake him up.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.883
All right.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.634
What happened
with Kathy?

30:50.724 --> 30:53.808
Uh... our lead
was a dead end.

30:53.894 --> 30:56.136
Never found her, but
we'll keep searching.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.720
And New England
National Bank?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.959
Oh, I was able to patch up the
vulnerabilities in the server.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.440
There won't be
any more hacks.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.587
And we opened
an investigation

31:02.611 --> 31:04.443
into their fraudulent
sales practices.

31:04.529 --> 31:05.940
Weitz would not
like that.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.523
Well, you can tell him
that 2.5 million people

31:08.617 --> 31:12.110
didn't appreciate having fake
accounts opened in their names.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.537
Fair enough.
Should be a fun call.

31:16.833 --> 31:17.833
You lied?

31:17.918 --> 31:21.082
You? Miss Perfect Patty.
You lied? I'm shocked.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.171
What else was
I supposed to do?

31:22.172 --> 31:23.252
I don't know,
have me do it.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.458
He would expect that
from you.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.795
- Yeah.
- Me... not so much.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.343
Whew. I'm seeing a whole
new side of you today.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.046
And I like it.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.052
I have never
had so much tea

31:34.142 --> 31:35.383
in my whole life.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.596
Thank you for
staying with me, Jane.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.807
I'm sorry for dumping my whole...
sob story on you.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.065
Well, I...
I'm glad you told me.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.192
Linda... I think Kurt
needs to hear it, too.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.903
Why you left...
what kept you away...

31:51.993 --> 31:54.861
No. He doesn't need
to hear any of that.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.162
He's carried enough.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.832
What would it change?
My kids grew up without me.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.534
They're gone.

32:06.383 --> 32:07.464
Here we go.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.422
I can't stop
thinking about Thomas.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.174
He has no idea

32:12.264 --> 32:13.721
that his mother
was lying to him.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.014
That she used him.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.262
He'll still have his dad.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.344
At least he's got
one parent to count on.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.440
Did you hear back
from the agents in Philly?

32:24.526 --> 32:26.813
Any update on
your mom's dealer?

32:26.903 --> 32:29.486
Apparently this Jason guy
is part of a very big gang.

32:29.573 --> 32:32.301
So even if you take him down, someone else
will just come to collect in his place.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.567
And they'll probably
want revenge.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.197
So I don't really
know what to do.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.325
Do you have the cash?

32:38.415 --> 32:40.122
My mother never did
a thing for me.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.370
So what am
I supposed to do...

32:42.461 --> 32:44.828
give up our future
to clean up her past?

32:44.921 --> 32:46.628
Yeah...

32:46.715 --> 32:48.957
I think you are.
She's family.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.002
Where's...

32:53.096 --> 32:55.213
Where's Thomas, my son?

32:55.307 --> 32:56.889
Thomas got away.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.388
But he is in danger.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.788
Can you tell us
where he might be?

33:00.812 --> 33:02.269
He said he was going
to the place

33:02.355 --> 33:03.937
that you told him to go...

33:04.024 --> 33:05.390
where you watch
the fireworks.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.272
Christine Porter's.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.477
Cooper Lake.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.689
My wife...
she stole files.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.364
She's dangerous.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.319
We know.
And we will find your son.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.456
Thomas!

33:23.877 --> 33:24.877
Mom...

33:27.047 --> 33:28.047
Hi.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.915
Do you know
how much I love you?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.500
- So much.
- Yeah.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.175
Okay.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.301
You're okay.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.223
That's the guy
that shot Dad.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.346
Thomas...

33:41.436 --> 33:43.268
I don't have time
to explain.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.062
You're just going
to have to trust me.

33:45.148 --> 33:48.232
Your dad is a bad man.

33:48.318 --> 33:51.686
Nikolai was trying to...
rescue you.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.193
He's a friend.
He won't hurt us.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.488
We got company.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.864
Okay, come over here.

34:12.007 --> 34:13.590
Move up!

34:18.431 --> 34:20.342
Ohh!

34:20.433 --> 34:21.452
I'll go around
to the other side.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.156
Two guys are
going around the back.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.605
Reloading!

34:42.914 --> 34:44.246
FBI.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.994
Stay back!

34:47.002 --> 34:48.868
FBI! Drop your weapon!

34:50.297 --> 34:52.038
You're not taking
my son from me.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.373
We just wanna talk.

34:53.466 --> 34:55.549
Thomas, my name is Kurt.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.001
I'm an agent
with the FBI.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.427
Your dad's okay.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.657
He's really worried
about you.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.388
My mom says
he's a bad guy.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.511
No... he's not.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.138
He was just trying
to protect you.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.685
Stop telling
my son lies!

35:06.771 --> 35:08.512
So stop using him
as a shield.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.974
I am the one
protecting him from you.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.726
Okay.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.438
There you go.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.272
Thomas deserves
to know the truth.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.278
So who's gonna
tell him that?

35:20.368 --> 35:21.779
You... or me?

35:21.870 --> 35:24.283
Mom... what is he
talking about?

35:24.372 --> 35:26.364
Don't believe anything
he says, babe.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.994
It's okay, Thomas.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.201
Just... come here to me.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.457
I'm gonna take you
to see your dad.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.584
Mom...

35:34.674 --> 35:36.461
I... I'm confused.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.089
I love you more than
anything in the world.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.420
If that's true...

35:40.513 --> 35:42.800
you have the chance
to prove it right now.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.929
You've made some
really bad decisions

35:46.019 --> 35:48.352
that have put Thomas
in jeopardy.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.976
You can make
the right choice now.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.104
For your son.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.857
So, please.

35:58.031 --> 35:59.567
Just let him go.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.240
Turn yourself in.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.862
Please, Mom.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.490
Do what they say.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.696
Let me go.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.041
Um, I'm...

36:21.137 --> 36:22.719
I am...

36:22.806 --> 36:25.298
so, so sorry.

36:25.392 --> 36:26.883
Please forgive me.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.476
Come here, Thomas.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.933
Come here.
Come here.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.197
Come here.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.577
Evan...

36:56.589 --> 36:58.046
Dad...

36:59.175 --> 37:00.416
Ohh!

37:04.806 --> 37:05.842
Thank you.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.093
It's my pleasure.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.470
I'll just be out here.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.597
You okay?

37:12.147 --> 37:13.433
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:13.523 --> 37:14.855
What are you
doing here?

37:14.941 --> 37:17.183
Well, your mom's
sleeping, and...

37:17.277 --> 37:18.643
the security detail's
with her.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.737
I just... I...

37:19.821 --> 37:22.359
I heard about the takedown.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.111
How's... How's Thomas?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.566
He's better now.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.196
He's back with his dad.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.949
That poor kid.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.995
His life's never
gonna be the same.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.037
Thanks to his mother.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.627
True. But...

37:37.714 --> 37:40.377
maybe he'll also
remember that...

37:40.467 --> 37:43.676
in the end,
she put him first.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.344
I mean, whatever else
she's done,

37:45.430 --> 37:48.514
she still
loves her son, Kurt.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.430
I don't know what
my mom told you today.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.471
But she
gave up on us.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.557
She walked away.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.562
There's no excuse
for that.

37:59.652 --> 38:03.145
But she was just
so full of regret, Kurt.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.322
And I just don't want
to see you do something

38:05.408 --> 38:07.900
that you regret because
you're hurt and angry.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.499
So, I, um...

38:15.585 --> 38:18.328
I looked into that story
that you told Jane.

38:18.421 --> 38:22.165
I asked her not
to tell you any of that.

38:22.258 --> 38:23.794
If I'd have known why

38:23.885 --> 38:26.628
we were running away from Dad
in the first place,

38:26.721 --> 38:28.758
things would have ended up
a whole lot differently.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.009
You were a child.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.011
I couldn't put that
on your shoulders.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.137
But you did.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.185
The moment you left...

38:35.271 --> 38:37.228
- it was all on me.
- I know.

38:37.315 --> 38:41.184
And if I could go back
and change it all, I would.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.769
But... I... I can't.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.401
I let my children down.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.859
That's what
I have to carry.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.696
You know, I thought
that I became an FBI agent

38:52.789 --> 38:54.121
because of Dad...

38:54.207 --> 38:57.200
to protect the world
from people like him.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.706
But I became one
because of you.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.583
Because you couldn't
protect us.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.756
I don't know if...
if I have the right,

39:07.846 --> 39:10.964
but I am so proud
of who you are.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.470
Of the man
that you've become.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.473
I'm sorry I've missed it.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.431
I'm gonna give you...

39:20.525 --> 39:22.141
that $100,000
that you need

39:22.235 --> 39:23.235
to pay off your debt.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.609
Also pay for a room...

39:27.699 --> 39:29.531
at a rehab center in Jersey.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.617
I don't know what to say.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.866
Just say that
you'll take it.

39:34.956 --> 39:37.198
It's all you need
for a fresh start.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.249
Please...

39:39.335 --> 39:41.918
don't throw it away.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.839
No, I won't.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.713
And I will pay you back
in any way I can.

39:53.266 --> 39:54.677
I love you.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.525
Mmm, you have
to try these noodles.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.102
Let's switch.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.734
Ohh, that's
way better than mine.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.911
Agreed.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.033
Now give me mine back.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.284
Not a chance.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.602
- Give me those noodles.
- Nope.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.367
Give me those noodles.

40:21.461 --> 40:22.793
Nope.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.873
Okay... fine.

40:27.967 --> 40:29.503
Consider them
my rent for the week.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.460
You're grossly out of touch

40:31.554 --> 40:32.990
with the New York City
housing market.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.801
You can stay here
as long as you want.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.848
On one condition.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.518
Could you not squeeze the
toothpaste from the middle?

40:41.981 --> 40:44.439
Okay, don't worry...
I won't stay here

40:44.525 --> 40:46.312
and ruin your precious
toothpaste forever.

40:46.402 --> 40:49.691
Once we get Dominic and stop
whatever Madeline's planning,

40:49.781 --> 40:52.148
I will finally
get my life back.

40:52.241 --> 40:55.655
Deal. Well, we also have
to talk about your snoring.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.031
- My snoring?
- Yep, we gotta...

40:57.121 --> 40:58.578
- Your snoring.
- I don't snore.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.247
You 1000 percent snore.

41:02.377 --> 41:03.618
Morning.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.498
Morning! Oh, wow.
This is nice.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.296
So, uh, about
that 200 grand

41:08.383 --> 41:09.383
that I loaned you.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.753
Wow, that was fast.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.071
Should I be worried
about my kneecaps?

41:12.095 --> 41:14.212
Listen, I am
one strip poker

41:14.305 --> 41:16.784
championship tournament away from
being able to pay you back in full.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.676
Hey, uh, you don't
have to pay me back.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.182
It was my idea,
I roped you into it.

41:22.271 --> 41:24.354
Wow, how mature
and generous of you.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.056
- Well, I just have so much money.
- Wow.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.461
And plus, I wanna
put this behind us.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.317
Hey, here's to that.
And here's to a reformed

41:29.404 --> 41:30.611
and rehabilitated
Kathy.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.563
May her newfound love
keep her happy, healthy,

41:32.657 --> 41:33.989
and the hell
away from us forever.

41:34.075 --> 41:35.407
Yeah.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.221
So we definitely can't
go to that wedding, right?

41:37.245 --> 41:38.736
- Yeah, definitely not.
- Okay.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.992
I just really
liked that suit.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.034
Our plan
worked perfectly.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.461
Now we can be together
forever.

41:47.547 --> 41:50.255
I love you,
butter muffin.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.718
I love you, too,
my little croissant.

41:55.805 --> 41:58.263
I've been counting the days
to hold you in my arms.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.635
And I can't wait
to marry you.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.638
Let's go to
Atlantic City right now.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.390
One thing at a time.

42:03.479 --> 42:06.517
First... we have to
finish what we started.

42:06.607 --> 42:07.893
Don't you want payback?

42:07.984 --> 42:10.101
More than anything.

42:10.194 --> 42:14.108
As soon as we're
done with Helios,

42:14.198 --> 42:15.484
it's just you and me.

42:15.575 --> 42:17.783
Forever... and ever.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.862
Then let's cause some chaos.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.151
Greg, move your head.
