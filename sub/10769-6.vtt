WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:07.071
What you doing, Carlton?

00:07.240 --> 00:08.707
Oh, packing away my CDs.

00:08.875 --> 00:12.709
Will and I made a bet. For one week,
I'm not allowed to listen to Tom Jones...

00:12.879 --> 00:17.248
...and he's not allowed to listen
to that god-awful Biggie Smalls.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.318
We have $50 riding on it
and I'm gonna win.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.613
Who's Tom Jones?

00:24.057 --> 00:27.720
Nicky, Nicky.
Tom Jones is the King of Swing.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.555
The Tower of Power. Mr. Vegas.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.219
This guy's a legend.

00:34.901 --> 00:36.698
Can I hear one of his songs?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.998
Oh, I'd love to, but no can do.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.937
Please?

00:45.612 --> 00:50.106
Well, I guess one song wouldn't hurt.

01:31.691 --> 01:34.558
Just couldn't hang on there could you,
little fella?

01:34.727 --> 01:36.558
Darn.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.858
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.829
Here's something for your trouble,
little brother. Thanks a lot.

01:48.174 --> 01:50.768
Five bucks? What do I look like?

01:50.944 --> 01:53.640
Come on, man.
You got to break me off some.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.321
- That movie was pathetic.
- Pathetic.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.727
Naked women bumping and grinding
on strangers' laps?

03:19.899 --> 03:23.596
And the way them guys
just sat there and took it.

03:24.103 --> 03:28.301
How can anyone find that attractive?
I mean, is our culture that diseased?

03:28.808 --> 03:32.938
You know, just thinking about it
is making me feel dirty.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.637
You know,
I'm gonna have to take a shower.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.145
You wanna join me?

03:39.552 --> 03:42.419
What am I saying? It's even infected me.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.281
<i>Hola.</i>

03:45.458 --> 03:47.221
- Hi.
- What'd you guys end up seeing?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.452
<i>- Showgirls.
- Again?</i>

03:51.331 --> 03:52.992
What does that make it,
eight times, Will?

03:54.334 --> 03:55.767
Eight times?

03:55.935 --> 03:57.300
You told me you hated it.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.903
No, baby, I did.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.905
I mean... And every time,
I wanted to just walk out of there.

04:03.142 --> 04:05.440
I know the feeling, Will. Bye.

04:05.612 --> 04:08.103
Wait, but, baby.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.909
Baby, hol... Oh, girl.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.983
Boy, did you handle that badly.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.483
Oh, good, Geoffrey, you're here.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.752
No.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.896
When did I ever ask you
for anything?

04:24.063 --> 04:26.998
You never stopped asking
from the moment I started here.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.033
- That's not true.
- In fact, as I remember...

04:30.203 --> 04:32.603
...I spent my first seven hours
of service here...

04:32.772 --> 04:36.435
...installing wall-to-wall carpet
for Barbie's Dream House.

04:36.609 --> 04:40.101
Carpet which had
to be promptly removed.

04:40.546 --> 04:44.073
Well, it's not my fault
that when Ken got home, he didn't like it.

04:45.485 --> 04:49.387
And it wasn't my fault the dollhouse burnt
to the ground.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.823
Geoffrey, Skipper died in that fire.

04:52.992 --> 04:56.655
I don't even wanna think about it.
Look, I need you to hem this dress.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.353
Come on.

04:58.531 --> 04:59.555
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

04:59.732 --> 05:02.963
Have you seen the notes I've been
working on for my speech tomorrow?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.433
They're right here, big guy.

05:04.604 --> 05:07.664
I've crossed out what didn't work
and rewritten the rest.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.569
How thoughtful.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.976
- Daddy, can I use your car tonight?
- No.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.875
- How about Mom's?
- Talk to her.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.141
Mom, Dad said it's okay
for me to use your car tonight.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.014
I didn't say that.

05:21.187 --> 05:26.056
Those weren't your exact words, Uncle Phil,
but you kind of did imply that...

05:26.225 --> 05:30.161
You know, there was absolutely no reason
for me to jump in here, was there?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.922
None whatsoever.

05:32.098 --> 05:35.761
- I'm gonna go ahead and jump out of here.
- Yes, jump on with your bad self.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.563
- It's fine if you take the car, honey.
- Oh, thank you.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.205
Ashley's going out tonight.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.570
I've given Geoffrey the night off
and Nicky's going to his first sleepover.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.210
Mm-hm.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.437
- Philip, the house will be nice and quiet.
- Mm.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.849
- You know what that means?
- Yeah, I can finally finish my speech.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.714
- Philip.
- What?

05:56.255 --> 05:59.486
- What?
- Nobody said anything.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.293
Nicky's first sleepover. Ahh.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.397
I'll never forget my first overnighter.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.623
Ned Martin's house.

06:06.799 --> 06:09.893
Raised all kinds of heck.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.128
Drank hot chocolate. Had pillow fights.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.865
Watched the O.J. trial.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.376
What a night.

06:22.815 --> 06:25.113
- Hi, Carlton.
- Hi, Michelle.

06:25.284 --> 06:28.651
Here,
I have a special delivery letter for you.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.751
Odd. No return address.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.153
A special invitation from me to you
for tonight.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.058
Please R.S.V.P. ASAP.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.698
Darn, another chain letter.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.099
Carlton, it's from me.

06:43.870 --> 06:47.203
Sweet cheeks of Buddha,
you pack a wallop.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.572
So you wanna go out tonight?

06:50.977 --> 06:52.205
Oh.

06:52.445 --> 06:54.242
No can do. I have to study tonight.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.608
On Saturday night?

06:56.015 --> 06:59.314
For some, it's bath night.
For me, it's math night.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.612
- But, hey, maybe you could help me?
- Oh.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.784
Well, I'd probably just get in your way.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.586
Yeah, you're probably right.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.328
Well, bye.

07:11.297 --> 07:12.787
Bye.

07:15.368 --> 07:19.134
Hmm. She seems a bit of a gloomy Gus.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.940
I can't believe Michelle hasn't called.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.046
I've left messages. I've paged her.

07:28.314 --> 07:31.772
Oh, God, I hope she's not disgruntled.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.952
You better be worrying about me
being disgruntled...

07:35.121 --> 07:37.612
...after the way you messed my date up
today.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.759
Will, I've come to the realization...

07:40.927 --> 07:42.326
...I don't understand women.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.429
Or men, for that matter.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.691
Maybe I should just talk to my Dad.
He understands women.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.767
I'm sorry about before.

07:49.936 --> 07:53.804
We're gonna have a great time tonight,
sweetheart. A great time.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.168
You know what I'm saying?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.971
I love you. Mm.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.078
Do you?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.780
Sweetheart, I just said I did.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.678
And you look beautiful.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.055
- Philip.
- I'm serious.

08:10.623 --> 08:14.059
For someone who's had four children,
you look amazing.

08:17.630 --> 08:21.464
Sandra, I'm telling you.
I really hated that movie.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.535
I don't know.
I guess in some sick kind of way...

08:24.704 --> 08:27.434
...I was just trying to punish myself.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.274
No, no, no. You're right.
No, I can be serious.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.308
Ju... Let me prove it to you.

08:33.479 --> 08:37.347
Sandra,
I seriously wanna go out with you tonight.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.679
Your cousin?

08:39.885 --> 08:43.082
No, no. I mean, I can find somebody
to go out with your cousin, yeah.

08:45.625 --> 08:50.426
Oh, no, no. That's no problem at all.
Hey, and I got the perfect guy for the job.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.058
All right, baby, you're the breast...

08:53.232 --> 08:55.723
Best! Best! I said best!

09:01.841 --> 09:03.274
No.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.535
Hey, hey, Carlton.
Come on, man. You owe me.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.645
You almost wrecked everything
with Sandra.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.440
I'm not gonna do it.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.106
Oh, you're not gonna do it.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.014
You know what? That's fine.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.654
It's probably time for me
to move on anyway, you know.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.813
As luck would have it,
it's come to my attention...

09:18.991 --> 09:22.017
...that there's this cute little mail carrier
that's available.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.389
- You wouldn't.
- Yeah, you're right.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.964
But that would be exactly
what you deserved.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.527
Will, I'm sorry
and I know I owe you one.

09:29.702 --> 09:33.502
But I just wouldn't feel right going out
and having a good time without Michelle.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.005
What if I could promise you
a terrible time?

09:39.011 --> 09:41.343
If I could only be sure.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.548
I guarantee you the worst time
that you have ever had in your life.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.679
Okay.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.387
We finally have the house
all to ourselves.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.327
Hi.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.730
Don't stop.
Go on with whatever you're doing.

10:36.902 --> 10:41.965
Wait. Oh, my God. Ew. What were you
doing? I don't even wanna think about it.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.371
- Where's Geoffrey?
- He's got the night off.

10:44.543 --> 10:45.737
What about my dress?

10:45.911 --> 10:47.742
I'm pretty sure he was wearing pants.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.050
Eww.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.855
Oh, let me tell you now,
that there was some good grub.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.996
That girl can cook.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.064
What about you, Carlton?
Did you enjoy your dinner?

11:07.767 --> 11:09.462
It was fine.

11:10.469 --> 11:12.903
You don't talk much, do you?

11:13.072 --> 11:15.939
Uhh, as a child,
he was dropped on his tongue.

11:16.942 --> 11:20.537
I think he's the strong silent type.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.047
Ooh. You are strong.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.542
Well, I'm no stranger to the gym.

11:29.221 --> 11:32.190
Carlton, how about some dessert?
I've got ice cream.

11:32.591 --> 11:36.220
Sweet chocolate ice cream.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.697
I'm a tutti-frutti man myself.

11:44.737 --> 11:49.140
What the heck is wrong with you, Carlton?
That girl just offered you two scoops.

11:49.975 --> 11:52.375
I'm afraid I'm a one-gal guy.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.947
What's so funny?

11:56.115 --> 11:58.549
We were just thinking
of a little game we could play.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.551
- Tiffany.
- Oh, come on, Sandra. It'll be fun.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.815
- Wait. What'll be fun?
- A word game.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.448
Oh, that ain't exactly the kind of a game
I was thinking about.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.524
It involves the word "strip."

12:12.698 --> 12:14.325
Set it up.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.496
Tell me this, Doogie.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.541
How is it possible that we're losing?

12:25.711 --> 12:29.010
I can't pull a vowel to save my life.

12:29.181 --> 12:33.277
As soon as you get warm,
I wanna see some skin again.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.579
You're on the demanding side,
ain't you, girl?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.485
- Hey, just play them or lose them.
- Hey. Hey.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.259
This thing is not over yet.

12:45.064 --> 12:48.966
Ah! Four. All right. All right.
A four-letter word, four-letter word.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.127
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo...

12:53.305 --> 12:56.672
...now some of y'all's clothes gots to go.

12:58.811 --> 12:59.971
Tiffany?

13:00.379 --> 13:01.573
Hey, who's that?

13:01.747 --> 13:03.044
Her boyfriend.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.080
What? You got a boyfriend?

13:05.251 --> 13:06.775
Of course.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.950
One second, Mad Dog.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.718
- Mad Dog?
- Mad Dog?

13:19.098 --> 13:20.122
- Mad Dog.
- Mad Dog.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.665
- Quick, in here.
- Don't pull on me, girl.

13:22.835 --> 13:26.771
Hey, would you...? Hey, hey, hey.
All right. Don't be push... Don't be push...

13:27.173 --> 13:28.333
This is just great.

13:28.507 --> 13:31.908
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I hate you.

13:32.077 --> 13:33.305
Shh!

13:33.846 --> 13:35.746
The dude is out there.
He's gonna hear us.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.383
Hear us? He's gonna kill us.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.714
That is if your breath don't kill us first.

13:42.021 --> 13:45.320
Damn, man. Don't you bring a mint
when you go on a date?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.051
As a matter of fact, I do.
They're in my pants pocket.

13:48.227 --> 13:50.354
You wanna go get them for me?

13:50.529 --> 13:51.928
Oh, this is ridiculous.

13:52.097 --> 13:56.261
Mad Dog.
I'm sure he's nothing but a pussy cat.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.010
He's gonna eat me.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.111
And then he gonna floss with me.

14:14.653 --> 14:17.520
I'm tired of your excuses.
But it's not an excuse.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.625
Just give me a minute to explain
and then I'm out of here.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.489
All right. You know, that's cool.
You know.

14:26.665 --> 14:30.362
As soon as the Black Ness Monster
explains, we'll be home free.

14:43.682 --> 14:45.343
Shh!

14:45.951 --> 14:48.317
He's sleeping.
Come on, you gotta get out of here.

14:48.487 --> 14:50.614
- Come on.
Oh, all right.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.761
I got this strange feeling
we forgetting something.

14:56.929 --> 15:00.831
You're right.
Thank you for a very lovely evening.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.061
- Hey, hey, what y'all do with our clothes?
- It's under him.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.971
Why you put our clothes...?

15:08.140 --> 15:10.608
Bel-Air's not that long of a walk.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.908
We just gonna get our clothes,
then we gonna go.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.604
From the looks of this brother,
he's a heavy sleeper.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.909
We all right. We all right.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.217
Just under. Under.

15:51.550 --> 15:54.144
Go on without me. Save yourself.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.155
Forget the clothes.
Let's just get out of here.

16:05.331 --> 16:06.662
Let's go.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.758
Who the hell are you?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.170
Um...

16:18.644 --> 16:22.410
This is just a dream.

16:27.386 --> 16:31.516
We're not really here.

16:32.224 --> 16:33.350
Stop that.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.588
Carlton, stop.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.334
I said, who the hell are you?

16:44.503 --> 16:45.800
Um...

16:46.605 --> 16:49.233
Surprise!

16:49.408 --> 16:52.309
Hey, man. We from
L.A. Stripper Gram. Yeah, you know.

16:52.478 --> 16:56.141
We got a special birthday wish
for you from Tiffany.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.475
Yeah, you know.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.982
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

17:01.153 --> 17:02.848
<i>Mad Dog</i>

17:03.022 --> 17:07.356
<i>Happy birthday, Mad Dog</i>

17:07.792 --> 17:09.260
It's not my birthday.

17:14.566 --> 17:17.160
<i>Macho, macho man</i>

17:17.502 --> 17:20.300
<i>I've got to be a macho man</i>

17:20.472 --> 17:22.736
<i>Young man, there's a place you can go</i>

17:22.907 --> 17:25.741
<i>I said, young man
You're all out on your own</i>

17:25.911 --> 17:28.402
<i>I said, Y-M-C-A</i>

17:29.615 --> 17:31.549
<i>Y- M-C-A</i>

17:31.750 --> 17:32.842
Stop it.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.610
Stop it.

17:35.454 --> 17:39.481
You know what? Somebody in here
is trying to play me for a fool.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.285
No, no, Mad Dog. None of that, man.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.552
No, you... You know...

17:47.966 --> 17:49.490
Someone's gonna die.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.600
Now, wait a minute. Now, hold on.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.740
Hold up. Hold up.
Now, wait a minute.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.503
This black-on-black crime makes me sick.

18:05.017 --> 18:10.387
Now, if this is what we gotta do,
just give me a damn minute with my cousin.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.788
Um...

18:17.362 --> 18:19.193
We're about to die.

18:20.199 --> 18:25.728
All right, but the best defense
is a strong offense, okay?

18:25.904 --> 18:28.338
So remember me for this.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.500
I'll see you on the other side.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.709
Sorry.

18:43.689 --> 18:47.887
Oh, my God. I just saw
the state of Florida just pass over my head.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.790
Hey, hey. Hey, Mad Dog. Mad Dog.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.555
Bro, bro, you know... Come on, man.

18:52.731 --> 18:55.427
Shouldn't you be climbing up
the Empire State Building?

18:55.601 --> 18:57.330
- Will, the window.
- Go, go.

19:13.352 --> 19:16.617
Bet you wish you wouldn't have gone off
that Slim Fast now, don't you?

19:17.322 --> 19:18.721
You're lucky.

19:18.891 --> 19:22.622
But eventually,
you're gonna have to come back in here.

19:22.794 --> 19:26.389
Shut up and get back in there,
you're stretching the building.

19:27.900 --> 19:32.633
Will, what are we gonna do now?

19:33.172 --> 19:38.235
Oh. Well, you know, it's almost winter.
Eventually, he's gonna have to hibernate.

19:38.410 --> 19:42.141
All we got to do, just hang out up here,
don't bring no attention to ourselves.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.373
Hey, look, those guys are gonna jump.

19:45.584 --> 19:49.315
No, no, man.
We're just out getting some air, man.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.694
This is the worst night of my life.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.789
Ain't that what I promised you?

20:02.734 --> 20:06.534
Don't panic.
I'm from the Crisis Intervention Unit.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.837
You're young.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.574
You're young.

20:17.616 --> 20:21.211
"And you have everything to live for."

20:22.588 --> 20:24.283
Just get us down.

20:24.456 --> 20:27.789
There you go,
putting the cart before the horse.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.626
Now, hand me the baby.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.858
Man, what are you doing?
We ain't got no baby, man.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.428
Oh, my bad.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.574
Will you get the hell
out of our way, fool?

20:42.741 --> 20:45.005
Hey, there's no need to be calling names.

20:45.177 --> 20:50.706
Sticks and stones will break your bones
but a 50-foot fall will kill y'all.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.380
I made that up myself.

20:55.487 --> 20:59.651
That civil service exam is really easy,
isn't it?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.686
But I have to admit...

21:05.864 --> 21:08.424
...there are times
that I just don't understand women.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.967
And it doesn't get any easier
when you get older.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.128
This is the one right here. Check this out.

21:14.973 --> 21:18.739
"I shouldn't have to tell you.
I mean, you should just know."

21:19.011 --> 21:21.502
How am I supposed to know?
Who do I look like, Dionne Warwick?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.272
No, no, no. This is my favorite.

21:23.448 --> 21:27.748
"If you love me as much as you say you do,
you'd know what I'm feeling."

21:27.919 --> 21:30.012
How am I supposed to know
what you're feeling?

21:30.188 --> 21:31.746
What does that mean?

21:31.923 --> 21:34.221
What are you guys talking about
that's so funny?

21:34.393 --> 21:35.553
Sports.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.524
- Football.
- Sports.

21:37.696 --> 21:41.564
Funny. I'm off to the hairdresser
to talk sports myself.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.633
Hey, this is the one right here.
This is the one.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.535
"If you was listening to me,
what'd I just say?"

21:49.708 --> 21:53.007
- They always say that.
- I wasn't listening, you know?

21:53.178 --> 21:54.873
Yo, yo, yo, how about this one?

21:55.047 --> 21:58.881
"Slow down, you're moving too fast.
We hardly even know each other."

21:59.584 --> 22:01.950
And then she has the nerve to get upset.
