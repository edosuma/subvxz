00:16.800 --> 00:21.790
So in 270 A.D. in Rome, nobody
was joining the army, right?

00:21.990 --> 00:23.500
Because no one wanted
to leave their wives.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.050
And the emperor was like,
"That's not happening."

00:26.250 --> 00:28.170
And he banned all marriages.

00:28.370 --> 00:31.050
But St. Valentine was like,
"That's not fair,"

00:31.250 --> 00:33.430
so he married couples in secret.

00:33.630 --> 00:37.180
The emperor arrested Valentine
and sentenced him to death,

00:37.380 --> 00:40.560
but he fell in love with the
prison guard's blind daughter.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.480
One night,
St. Valentine reached out

00:43.680 --> 00:46.110
and touched the eyes
of the blind girl,

00:46.310 --> 00:51.280
and in the morning, she could
see for the very first time.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.340
The date?

00:53.170 --> 00:54.530
February 14th.

00:54.730 --> 00:58.260
And the rest,
as they say, is history.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.920

That was interesting.

01:01.110 --> 01:02.750
Come on.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.560
Zoey, do you have something
you'd like to add?

01:05.770 --> 01:07.510
Just that story's
not really accurate.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.470
- Excuse me?
- First of all,
there were several

01:09.670 --> 01:11.630
St. Valentines who were martyred
in the third century

01:11.830 --> 01:14.100
and... and second of all,
none of them
cured a girl's blindness.

01:14.290 --> 01:15.220
That didn't happen.

01:15.420 --> 01:17.470
Okay, well,
it could have happened.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.060
Come on, it's Valentine's Day.

01:20.260 --> 01:21.060
It felt on brand.

01:21.260 --> 01:22.200
Yeah, exactly, 'cause...

01:22.660 --> 01:25.480
'cause Valentine's Day,
it's kind of about bullshit.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.070
Okay, Zoey, do you wanna
elaborate?

01:27.270 --> 01:29.000
[Zoey] It's just the whole
concept of falling in love

01:29.460 --> 01:32.110
and even romantic love,
it's just a product
of capitalism.

01:32.310 --> 01:33.490
[Kellog] Whoa, hold up, Zoey.

01:33.690 --> 01:36.240
So you don't believe
in romantic love at all?

01:36.440 --> 01:37.300
If it's based on compatibility.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.710
I just think
that's really hard to find,

01:41.910 --> 01:45.310
which is actually why
I created my own app.

01:46.310 --> 01:47.750

01:47.950 --> 01:51.470
It matches people
based on a data-driven
compatibility report

01:51.670 --> 01:53.050
because people
are really fickle.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.110
But algorithms are smart.

01:54.530 --> 01:56.890
Over 50% of marriages
end in divorce,

01:57.090 --> 01:58.970
and some people,
they see that as a problem.

01:59.170 --> 02:03.980

I see that as potential,
like a future revenue stream.

is a modern-day invention.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.620
Cool.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.110
Textbooks are in the front.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.860
Fictions on the right,
and non-fiction's over there.

10:30.060 --> 10:30.920
Thank you.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.870
Do you have any books on
"Battletoads"?

10:38.070 --> 10:40.290
Is that medieval history or a
metal band?

10:40.490 --> 10:41.290
It's a video game.

10:41.490 --> 10:43.060
No, we don't carry books like
that.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.170
I could order it for you.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.230
Yeah, that... that'd be cool.
Great.

10:49.310 --> 10:53.630
Okay, so two choices,
"The Idiot's Guide to
Battletoads"

10:53.830 --> 10:55.720
or "Battletoads for Dummies."

10:55.920 --> 10:58.100
Jesus, they both sound bad,
don't they?

10:58.290 --> 10:59.640
Well, a dummy is someone
of low intelligence,

10:59.840 --> 11:02.430
but it can also mean, like,
a crash test dummy.

11:02.630 --> 11:04.450
But an idiot's just an idiot.

11:06.910 --> 11:07.830
Let's go with dummy.

11:08.290 --> 11:09.150
Good choice.

11:09.350 --> 11:10.900
Thank you.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.150
Uh, it should be here by
Wednesday.

11:14.350 --> 11:15.300
Okay.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.090
Oh, credit card.

11:19.050 --> 11:20.630
Mm. Here you go.

11:23.470 --> 11:26.290
You know video games are now
the leading cause of divorce?

11:26.490 --> 11:27.830
Who says that?

11:28.030 --> 11:30.710
An actuary chart listing
the causes of divorce.

11:30.910 --> 11:32.230
- An actual what?
- An actuary.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.510
Someone who compiles statistics
to assess risk and uncertainty.

11:35.710 --> 11:38.090
Could you... could you actually
order me a book on that as well?

11:38.290 --> 11:39.510
Really?

11:39.710 --> 11:40.570
No.

11:43.410 --> 11:46.350
Sarcasm's frequently an attempt
to deflect one's ignorance.

11:46.550 --> 11:47.310
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

11:47.510 --> 11:49.830
Yeah. So is being a know-it-all.

11:50.830 --> 11:53.320
All right, thanks.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.460
Have a good one.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.960
Touché.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.010
Oh.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.200
Hey, hey.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.330
[upbeat music playing]

12:09.530 --> 12:11.730
Hey, Zach, you forgot your
credit card.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.690
Hey, Zach.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.380
Zach, wait.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.690
Hey!

12:18.690 --> 12:19.890
Zach, wait.

12:20.080 --> 12:20.840
- Oh!
- [Zoey] Oh!

12:21.040 --> 12:23.850
- [driver] Oh, no!
- [people gasping]

12:24.050 --> 12:25.120
Oh, my God.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.600
Oh, oh, oh, my God.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.830
Zach.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.940
Oh, my God. Zach.
Oh, my God. Zach?

12:32.140 --> 12:34.570
I didn't...is he okay?
He came out of, like, nowhere.

12:34.770 --> 12:36.360
Zach! He's not responding. Call
911.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.360
Zach, wake up.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.070
Oh, my God. Please don't die.

12:40.270 --> 12:41.070
- They wanna know if he's
breathing.
- I don't know.

12:41.270 --> 12:42.420
- Check!
- I can't tell.

12:42.840 --> 12:43.680
She can't tell.
They say give him
mouth-to-mouth.

12:44.090 --> 12:44.950
- What?
- [driver] Pinch the nose.

12:45.150 --> 12:46.680
- Wha-
- [driver] You have to pinch the
nose.

12:51.810 --> 12:54.100
- [Zach gasping]
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.190
[Zach] Where am I?

12:57.900 --> 12:59.840
Oh, my God. You're alive.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.260
- He's alive.
- [driver] He's alive. He's
alive.

13:01.460 --> 13:02.990
He's alive. Yeah.

13:06.110 --> 13:07.600
Uh, what happened?

13:07.800 --> 13:08.980
You got in an accident.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.650
You're gonna be fine.
The ambulance is on its way.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.980
Oh, here. They wanna talk to
you.

13:13.180 --> 13:14.310
- Me?
- [driver] Yeah, you.

13:14.510 --> 13:16.650
Okay. Yeah? Yeah.

13:16.850 --> 13:17.860
Yeah, uh, he's alive.

13:18.060 --> 13:21.410
He's breathing and talking,
so just keep him awake.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.880
- Sorry.
- Ow.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.290
- My name? Zoey.
- What'd you hit me for?

13:26.480 --> 13:28.580
[soft ethereal music playing]

13:28.780 --> 13:29.890
Zoey.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.100
Oh, thank God it's you.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.710
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank God it's you.

13:38.910 --> 13:41.550
You're okay.
The ambulance is on its way.

13:41.750 --> 13:42.550
Ah.

13:42.750 --> 13:43.590
Oh. Oh. All right. Oh.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.530
[kisses]

13:45.400 --> 13:46.560
All righty. Okay.

13:46.750 --> 13:50.020
- You're... you're definitely
gonna live.
- Ow... yeah.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.080
So don't worry about that.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.440
[siren wailing]

13:53.640 --> 13:54.450
Oh, I hear it.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.250
- Ah.
- Finally. Thank God.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.620
- [Zoey] Is he gonna be okay?
- [EMT] Probably.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.550
We're gonna take you to the
hospital,
get you checked out.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.250
- You're coming with me, right?
- To the hospital?

14:12.450 --> 14:15.040
I kind of need you to come,
please.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.590
Me?

14:16.780 --> 14:19.670
It's probably best if you come
just to keep him relaxed.

14:19.870 --> 14:20.730
Okay.

14:22.110 --> 14:23.020
Thank you.

14:25.690 --> 14:26.610
- Ooh.
- [Zoey] Oh.

14:33.830 --> 14:36.190
[soft suspenseful music playing]

14:36.390 --> 14:37.460
Triage, please.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.820
Oh.

14:40.020 --> 14:40.960
[elevator dings]

14:45.010 --> 14:47.550
Oh, are you all right?
What happened?

14:48.550 --> 14:49.660
I'm... I'm fine.

14:49.860 --> 14:50.660
I wouldn't say fine.

14:50.860 --> 14:52.830
- He's actually got a concussion.
- Oh, my God.

14:53.030 --> 14:55.370
[doctor] He was riding a bike,
hit a car,
and went head-first over the
hood.

14:55.570 --> 14:58.250
He doesn't remember the accident
or anything immediately prior.

14:58.450 --> 15:00.960
Things dating back a few weeks
are fuzzy.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.900
- So he has amnesia.
- It's normal.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.340
What's normal about amnesia?

15:04.540 --> 15:06.340
But it's only temporary, right,
doctor?

15:06.540 --> 15:07.890
- Most likely, yes.
- Most likely.

15:08.090 --> 15:08.890
Were you texting?

15:09.090 --> 15:12.140
No, he wasn't texting,
but he did break his phone.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.390
[Mr. Maclaren] Who are you?

15:13.590 --> 15:14.530
Zoey.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.110
Zoey? The Zoey?

15:18.300 --> 15:19.110
Yeah.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.610
[Connie] Oh, Zach has done
nothing
but talk about you.

15:20.810 --> 15:22.380
- He has?
- Mom.

15:22.710 --> 15:25.530
Okay, well, he's mentioned you
once or twice.

15:25.730 --> 15:26.530
We barely know each other.

15:26.730 --> 15:29.200
You've been dating, what?
Two, three weeks now, right?

15:29.400 --> 15:32.410
- Dating?
- Mom, could you not, please?

15:32.610 --> 15:33.870
[scoffs] I'm sorry.

15:34.070 --> 15:34.870
You were with Zach when it
happened.

15:35.070 --> 15:36.080
You called 911.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.080
- Yes, but that's...
- Okay.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.960
I'm gonna go ahead and release
Zach.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.630
No screens for 72 hours.

15:41.830 --> 15:43.670
Blue lights can make the
symptoms worse.

15:43.870 --> 15:45.630
Make sure he stays hydrated and
rest.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.630
He will get his memory back,
though, right?

15:47.830 --> 15:49.600
Just stick to a stress-free
routine.

15:49.790 --> 15:50.600
Keep it simple.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.600
I'm sorry, but we have a family
ski trip
planned for this weekend.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.480
As long as he stays off the
slopes
and rests, it's not a problem.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.440
- [Connie] Thank you, Doctor.
- [Matt] That's great. Thanks,
Doctor.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.150
Thanks, Doc.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.650
[Connie] You're coming home with
us
so that we can keep an eye on
you.

16:02.850 --> 16:06.070
And young lady,
you are coming over for dinner.

16:06.270 --> 16:08.070
- No, no, no. That's really
not...
- [both] We insist.

16:08.270 --> 16:09.530
- I'm a fabulous cook.
- He is.

16:09.730 --> 16:11.070
Of course, you are. Come on.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.130
Right.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.410
Let me just call my roommate.

16:14.610 --> 16:16.970
Tell her, uh, where I will be.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.670
Oh, sweetheart, she is just
adorable.

16:20.870 --> 16:22.250
I really like her.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.090
I do too.

16:24.290 --> 16:25.090
She's pretty cool.

16:25.290 --> 16:27.010
[toy playing melody]

16:27.210 --> 16:28.680
[imitating engine roaring]

16:28.880 --> 16:31.720
Parker, stop bashing your
brother
with that truck.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.720
What's up?

16:32.920 --> 16:35.350
- [whispering] I'm at the
hospital.
- [Elle] Why? What happened?

16:35.550 --> 16:37.770
I'm here with Zach Maclaren.

16:37.970 --> 16:39.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up.

16:40.140 --> 16:41.330
How did that happen?

16:42.250 --> 16:44.920
So long story short,
he came into the bookstore.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.990
I made him hit a car,
which was an accident.

16:47.190 --> 16:49.780
Now he has a concussion
and he thinks that I'm his
girlfriend.

16:49.980 --> 16:52.010
- He is dating a Zoey.
- Zoey who?

16:52.210 --> 16:53.930
- The other Zoey.
- What other Zoey?

16:54.130 --> 16:56.620
Wallace, captain of
the women's soccer team.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.140
You guys do kind of look alike.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.560
Wait, I just texted you her
Insta.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.380
[Zoey]
I mean, maybe there's a tiny
resemblance.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.470
She's very into soccer.

17:09.670 --> 17:12.010
Yeah, I'm sure they'd rate high
in your compatibility app.

17:12.210 --> 17:15.100
Oh, hey, make sure Zach takes it
easy.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.350
Nothing that will upset him
or his symptoms could get worse.

17:18.550 --> 17:19.690
- Good.
- [Zoey] Okay.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.850
Wait, who was that?

17:21.050 --> 17:22.920
That was the doctor. What do I
do?

17:23.120 --> 17:25.400
Well, you don't wanna be
the cause of him getting worse.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.480
[Zoey] You know what?

17:26.680 --> 17:30.490
Zach's parents, they invited me
to dinner, so I'm just gonna go
to their place.

17:30.690 --> 17:33.160
I'm gonna get them alone,
and I'm gonna tell 'em the
truth.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.200
Yeah.
Let them break their son's
brain.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.290
[Zoey] Perfect.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.260
I have to call you back. Bye.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.790
[twins giggling]

17:42.990 --> 17:44.500
[Elle] Why would you do that?

17:44.700 --> 17:50.510
[upbeat calypso music playing]

17:50.710 --> 17:53.180
I have texted him like a billion
times.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.390
Zoey, we're in The Bahamas.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.430
I.. I bet it's the reception.

17:57.630 --> 17:58.430
I'm using Wi-Fi.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.390
I'm sure Zach will respond soon,
dear.

18:00.590 --> 18:01.390
What if he's ghosting me?

18:01.590 --> 18:03.940
I seriously don't... I don't
even know
what ghosting means, honey.

18:04.140 --> 18:05.750
We were texting this morning and
then...

18:07.750 --> 18:09.280
Do you think he met someone?

18:09.480 --> 18:10.690
Between breakfast and lunch?

18:10.890 --> 18:12.900
He is going skiing, mom.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.670
Do you even know how cute
all the snow bunnies are?

18:16.670 --> 18:18.550
You should have never booked
this trip.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.000
She has been in a funk
ever since Barcelona lost Messi.

18:23.200 --> 18:27.090
Wallaces don't wallow,
and crying causes wrinkles.

18:27.290 --> 18:28.140
Just know that.

18:36.990 --> 18:40.100
Your parents' house is really
nice.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.160
Yeah, thanks.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.160
Something feels different.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.520
I don't know.

18:49.720 --> 18:54.070
Do you remember, like,
hitting a girl in the head

18:54.270 --> 18:55.240
with a soccer ball?

18:55.440 --> 19:00.050
No, but I mean, I do... I do
remember...

19:01.220 --> 19:03.910
- Kissing you...
- Oh! [laughs]

19:04.110 --> 19:07.210
Remember the doctor said
to take it slow and easy.

19:07.410 --> 19:10.840
I just... I want to thank you
for saving my life today.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.150
It was probably my fault.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.880
- Boo!
- Holy shit.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.640
Uh-oh, you said the S word.

19:16.830 --> 19:19.010
You know what?
That's what happens when you
scare people.

19:19.210 --> 19:20.760
This is my little sister, Avery.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.270
My name's not Avery.

19:22.470 --> 19:23.480
It's Amanda.

19:23.670 --> 19:24.530
Ha!

19:29.120 --> 19:30.900
Amand... what are you talking
about?

19:31.100 --> 19:31.960
Amanda?

19:32.380 --> 19:33.240
She's messing with you.

19:33.430 --> 19:35.200
I think your parents might have
told her

19:35.390 --> 19:36.910
- that you have memory issues.
- Oh.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.090
- Wanna fire up the Xbox?
- Yes.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.890
- No, he's not allowed screen
time.
- No.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.870
- Sucks to be you.
- So mean.

19:44.070 --> 19:45.790
If you need me,
I'll just be playing
"Battletoads"

19:45.990 --> 19:47.540
as much as I want!

19:47.740 --> 19:48.680
Booyah!

19:50.180 --> 19:53.000
Video games are
the leading cause of divorce,

19:53.200 --> 19:55.360
and I have no idea how I know
that.

19:57.690 --> 19:59.930
- She's so mean.
- That just came back?

20:00.130 --> 20:00.930
Hmm?

20:01.130 --> 20:03.720
Is there anything else
that might be coming back?

20:03.920 --> 20:05.520
Mostly how pretty you are.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.480
I'm gonna help your parents with
dinner.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.020
Very nice of you.

20:09.220 --> 20:10.980
- [Matt] Trade you for the olive
oil.
- [Connie] Okey-dokey.

20:11.180 --> 20:12.440
[Matt] Thank you.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.990
Ah, Zach was telling me that you
were

20:15.180 --> 20:17.780
supposed to go to the Bahamas
this weekend with your family.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.590
Yeah.
There's something that I need to
tell you.

20:20.630 --> 20:24.840
- My family is not in the
Bahamas.
- Why's that, dear?

20:25.140 --> 20:26.450
Well, this is gonna sound
really weird, but...

20:26.650 --> 20:29.000
Hey, guys.
Hey, I just heard about Zach. Is
he okay?

20:29.200 --> 20:31.000
[Matt] He has a concussion.
He needs to take it easy.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.540
Come on.
You know the statistics on that.

20:32.740 --> 20:33.550
[Matt] He's right.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.840
Zoey, this is Miles, Zach's
cousin.

20:36.040 --> 20:36.840
Hi.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.880
Ah, the... the soccer player?

20:39.080 --> 20:39.890
Mm-hmm.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.550
Dude, you're lucky it's not
worse.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.680
That's because Zoey saved my
life.

20:43.880 --> 20:44.740
Not exactly.

20:46.450 --> 20:49.140
Miles is in grad school at MIT.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.020
Oh. [chuckles]

20:51.220 --> 20:52.980
He's just visiting for the
weekend.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.070
I hear that that's a really
great school.

20:55.270 --> 20:56.880
Yeah. Thanks.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.170
Dude, I can't believe
you weren't wearing a helmet.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.670
You gotta be more careful.
Is the bike destroyed?

21:02.010 --> 21:03.970
So you were telling me
about your family trip.

21:05.130 --> 21:08.010
Oh, we had to postpone it.

21:09.100 --> 21:12.000
Something came up.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.850
Well, just.. everybody just dig
in.
Dig in.

21:17.190 --> 21:18.020
[soft ethereal music playing]

21:23.240 --> 21:24.150
[chuckle]

21:27.950 --> 21:31.660
So Zoey, Zach tells me
that your dad's a doctor.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.110
Yeah, he is.

21:34.310 --> 21:35.160
What kind?

21:36.040 --> 21:40.990
The kind that sees patients,
uh, in his office.

21:41.190 --> 21:43.910
[chuckles] Oh, oh, I remember.

21:44.110 --> 21:45.620
He's a GP, right?

21:45.820 --> 21:46.620
Yeah, he is.

21:46.820 --> 21:52.000
He is a great physician.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.180
[all chuckle]

21:54.560 --> 21:55.690
I'm sure he is.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.980
So are you training
during the off-season?

22:00.730 --> 22:02.010
Yeah.

22:02.210 --> 22:03.820
Just kicking all those balls.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.760
What position do you play?

22:07.960 --> 22:10.060
Uh, somewhere in the middle.

22:10.260 --> 22:13.690
Sometimes... sometimes on the
left...

22:13.890 --> 22:16.330
sometimes on the right.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.030
[laughter]

22:21.230 --> 22:23.450
Yeah, but you know,
soccer can only go so far.

22:23.650 --> 22:25.820
I was actually thinking about
grad school,

22:26.020 --> 22:28.200
maybe MIT for computer science.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.910
You're interested in coding?

22:30.110 --> 22:30.970
Yeah, it's my major.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.040
I don't... I don't remember
that.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.420
Wait, do I?

22:36.620 --> 22:39.000
Oh, my gosh, it's your amnesia.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.800
Oh, my gosh. This is so cool.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.110
- Please forget something else.
- Be nice.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.360
Well, Zoey, I, for one, am
impressed
that you have so many interests.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.010
Thanks.

22:48.210 --> 22:50.180
You know, Miles is studying
computer science.

22:50.380 --> 22:52.680
- Applied machine learning.
- That's amazing.

22:52.880 --> 22:53.810
Thank you.

22:54.010 --> 22:57.160
I didn't know that we had that
in common.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.490
All right, hey, guys, uh, six
letters.

23:03.690 --> 23:05.660
Inventor of calculus.

23:05.860 --> 23:06.550
- [Zoey] Newton.
- [Miles] Newton.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.950
Oh, that fits.

23:08.150 --> 23:11.240
Yeah, yeah.
I.. I.. I had that one too.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.720
Gotta be quick on the buzzer,
dude.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.720
A strip of land, seven letters.

- [Avery] Mm...
- [Zach] Mm...

23:20.850 --> 23:22.550
- Island.
- That has six letters.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.610
- That has six letters?
- [Zoey and Miles] Isthmus.

23:24.810 --> 23:26.190
[Matt] Oh, that fits too.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.780
[Connie]
Well done, you two. I'm
impressed.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.390
I gotta hit it.

23:36.590 --> 23:38.520
I present my master's thesis
next week.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.480
Dude, you should get some rest.
You have a concussion.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.690
[Zach] Yeah. Thank you, Doc.

23:42.890 --> 23:43.690
- All right, man.
- Good night.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.210
- [Connie] Good night.
- Good night, Miles.

23:45.630 --> 23:46.820
- Bye.
- Night, man.

23:47.020 --> 23:49.490
Hey, we're all gonna go skiing
in the mountains this weekend.

23:49.690 --> 23:51.030
Do you wanna go with us?

23:51.230 --> 23:53.430
- Oh, yeah, you should.
- It's a great idea.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.660
Oh, uh...

23:55.860 --> 23:57.750
you know, I don't know
if it's such a good idea.

23:57.950 --> 24:00.840
I mean, you just got injured,

24:01.040 --> 24:03.590
and I have plans
with my mom this weekend.

24:03.790 --> 24:04.840
[phone buzzing]

24:05.040 --> 24:08.110
Oh, and that's my mom,
so I should ask her.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.240
Okay. Sorry.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.720
[Elle] What'd they say?

24:14.920 --> 24:18.140
Nothing, 'cause I haven't told
them yet.

24:18.340 --> 24:19.730
What are you waiting for?
Graduation?

24:19.930 --> 24:22.400
Remember the guy from the
lecture?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.570
The one you called interesting
23 times?

24:24.770 --> 24:26.070
Uh, doesn't ring a bell.

24:26.270 --> 24:30.200
Well, his name is Miles,
and he's actually Zach's cousin,

24:30.400 --> 24:33.080
and he's here visiting from MIT,

24:33.280 --> 24:35.410
and they invited me
to go skiing with them.

24:35.610 --> 24:38.830
Okay, I don't wanna jump
to conclusions, but this is
fate.

24:39.030 --> 24:41.170
- I don't believe in fate.
- [Elle] You believe in
probability!

24:41.370 --> 24:43.960
What is the probability of a guy
you find interesting

24:44.160 --> 24:46.840
ending up in the house of a guy
you're pretending to be the
girlfriend of?

24:47.040 --> 24:47.900
Statistically speaking?
Like, zero.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.760
[Elle] Because it's
fate.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.350
You gotta carpe diem this
all the way to the ski slope.

24:52.540 --> 24:55.890
I caused the accident,
and now I'm gonna flirt

24:56.090 --> 24:57.980
with an amnesia patient's
cousin?

24:58.180 --> 24:58.980
Plug it into your app.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.020
One, Zach has a concussion.

25:01.220 --> 25:02.940
Two, he has a girlfriend.

25:03.140 --> 25:05.690
Three, the doctor told you
not to upset him.

25:05.890 --> 25:09.630
Four, his cousin is a hot
computer nerd

25:10.050 --> 25:11.110
who you have a ton
of things in common with.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.320
What does that all add up to?
A perfect match.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.260
Pretend to be the other Zoey.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.450
That's not the way
that the app actually works.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.040
Well, it should be.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.140
Hmm.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.000
And Miles is only here for the
weekend.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.150
[Elle] Exactly. Have some fun,
Zoey.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.740
[phone ringing]

25:37.700 --> 25:38.680
Hey.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.350
I'm not coming home this
weekend.

25:40.550 --> 25:41.350
Are you okay?

25:41.550 --> 25:44.150
I actually got invited
to go skiing with some friends.

25:44.350 --> 25:45.210
Well, I was really looking
forward
to seeing you

25:45.620 --> 25:46.650
but that sounds fun.

25:46.850 --> 25:47.710
I'm sorry, Mom.

25:48.170 --> 25:50.490
It's okay, I'm glad you're
getting
out there and making new
friends.

25:50.690 --> 25:51.990
Just make sure you go on the
bunny hill

25:52.190 --> 25:54.070
because I went skiing once,
and I went through these trees

25:54.270 --> 25:55.660
and I almost died.

25:55.860 --> 25:56.660
What are you up to this weekend?

25:56.860 --> 25:59.510
Don't worry about me.
I have plenty to do.

25:59.850 --> 26:00.790
Okay. Bye. Love you.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.230
The professor came home late,
but they paid me extra.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.140
What is that?

26:07.520 --> 26:11.470
Okay, so this one,
it's about computational
analysis,

26:11.670 --> 26:14.340
and it's really advanced,
so I think that Miles might be
impressed,

26:14.540 --> 26:16.390
but he also might think that,
like,
I'm trying to intimidate him.

26:16.590 --> 26:20.980
So then this one
is on computational theory,

26:21.180 --> 26:22.640
and Maya Sayeed wrote it,
and we both love her,

26:22.840 --> 26:23.690
and it kinda shows
how much we have in common,

26:23.890 --> 26:26.210
but I don't want him to think
that I'm, like, overthinking,

26:26.460 --> 26:27.650
so I don't know which one to
bring.

26:27.850 --> 26:28.920
What should I do?

26:30.420 --> 26:31.490
Oh! Wha...

26:31.690 --> 26:33.610
Less books, more bathing suits.

26:33.810 --> 26:35.870
Okay, you're going skiing.
Do you know what that means?

26:36.070 --> 26:36.920
Yes.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.450
No. Hot tub. You know what?

26:40.650 --> 26:42.180
I can't believe I have to
explain this.

26:43.010 --> 26:44.420
I got some for you. I got some
for you.

26:44.620 --> 26:45.670
- Here.
- What is that?

26:45.870 --> 26:50.670
I'm giving you my sexy, hot,
never fails bathing suit.

26:50.870 --> 26:51.760
- Okay.
- [Elle] Yeah.

26:51.960 --> 26:52.900
Okay, fine.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.990
Geez, you're welcome.

26:57.740 --> 26:59.410
What about Zoey Wallace?

27:00.410 --> 27:02.680
I bet that she's super worried
about Zach,

27:02.880 --> 27:04.850
- you know, not being able to
reach him.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my
God.

27:05.050 --> 27:06.980
Zoey, please get out of your
head.

27:07.180 --> 27:08.480
The other Zoey is the other
Zoey.

27:08.680 --> 27:09.820
Let's focus on this Zoey.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.780
You're going skiing
with a guy who has amnesia,

27:12.980 --> 27:14.490
and you're pretending to be
someone else.

27:14.690 --> 27:17.910
I mean, that's, like,
the perfect vacation.

27:18.110 --> 27:19.780
- That's the perfect vacation?
- [Elle] Yeah.

27:19.980 --> 27:22.000
[upbeat calypso music playing]

27:22.190 --> 27:24.750
[Mrs. Wallace] Oh, my God.
I think that's a baby whale.

27:24.950 --> 27:27.330
Zoey, Zoey, Zoey, sweetie.

27:27.530 --> 27:29.250
- Zoey, wake up.
- Not now!

27:29.450 --> 27:30.840
I'm in deep focus.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.550
Aqua yoga is starting by the
pool.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.780
I've reserved three pods.

27:34.980 --> 27:36.760
These are the girls I think
could be my competition,

27:36.960 --> 27:38.340
girls that Zach follows on
Instagram,

27:38.540 --> 27:40.280
and he's liked some of their
photos
like Amy.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.980
Okay, she's a 7. You're a 12.
Okay.

27:44.170 --> 27:45.890
I should have never passed her
that ball.

27:46.090 --> 27:48.560
- I should have taken that shot.
- Oh, my God, you're
overreacting.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.980
Mom, he's either dead, or he's
dumped me.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.690
Honestly, I'm not sure which is
worse.

27:52.890 --> 27:54.280
I think dead is worse for sure.

27:54.480 --> 27:57.070
[Mr. Wallace]
Let's go. Aqua yoga starts in
five.

27:57.270 --> 27:58.410
Dad, read the room.

Call the airlines.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.120
- Oh, my God, again.
- [Zoey] I need to get back

28:01.320 --> 28:03.200
and find out where's Zach is...

[Connie] Ah!

28:56.040 --> 28:57.510
Wow, this is better than the
pictures.

28:57.710 --> 28:58.880
- Nice job, honey.
- [Avery] Whoa.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.220
Thank you.

29:00.420 --> 29:01.640
[Zoey] Wow.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.930
This is amazing.

29:03.130 --> 29:04.700
Yeah, this is fantastic.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.410
Hey, Zach, remember how much fun
we had here last time?

29:09.200 --> 29:10.660
Um, yeah.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.190
Have we been here before?

29:13.390 --> 29:14.820
No, memory boy. I'm messing with
you.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.610
- Mm.
- It's a rental.

29:16.810 --> 29:20.360
Oh, Zoey, you and Avery don't
mind
bunking together, do you?

29:20.560 --> 29:22.200
I don't mind. I understand.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.910
Any more excitement for Zach,
and his brain will explode.

29:25.110 --> 29:26.160
- [imitates explosion]
- Avery.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.200
Hey, let's get up the mountain.
Get half a day in.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.710
Oh, yeah, let's do it.
Zach, honey, remember, no
screens.

29:31.910 --> 29:33.710
Oh, I know. Yeah.

29:33.910 --> 29:37.460
Fair warning, it's been a really
long time since I last
snowboarded.

29:37.660 --> 29:38.880
I feel like you said you went
every year.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.840
- Twelve months is a really...
long time.
- [Miles] Don't worry.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.400
- It's like riding a bike.
- Is that the best analogy?

29:44.400 --> 29:46.180
Sorry. Sorry, dude.

29:46.380 --> 29:47.640
She's a little insensitive. It's
fine.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.680
- Yeah, it's all good.
- What are you gonna do?

29:49.880 --> 29:50.910
I mean, the mountain's
beautiful.

29:51.370 --> 29:55.440
Maybe just hang at the lodge,
grab a book, read something.

29:55.640 --> 29:56.940
- Do you have a book?
- I do not.

29:57.140 --> 30:00.990
I have one.
It's about female spies in World
War II.

30:01.190 --> 30:04.070
It might not be your thing,
but just in case.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.490
Oh, okay. Well... cool.

30:06.690 --> 30:08.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:09.050 --> 30:11.370
All right. Should we, uh, hit
the slopes?

30:11.570 --> 30:12.430
Hit we shall.

30:16.020 --> 30:18.400
Sorry. It sounded cooler in my
head.

30:19.520 --> 30:25.820
[upbeat rock music playing]

30:32.280 --> 30:34.660
[Avery] That's a lot of struggle
for a soccer player.

30:35.660 --> 30:36.940
Have you ever snowboarded?

30:37.140 --> 30:38.150
What?

30:38.350 --> 30:40.070
She'll be at it in no time,
don't worry.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.450
Got it. Easy.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.820
- [yelling]
- [Miles] Whoa!

30:45.020 --> 30:47.760
[Zoey]
I got it! I'm good. I'm good.
I'm good.

30:48.220 --> 30:50.330
- I'm good.
- I got you.

30:50.530 --> 30:51.330
Are you okay, honey?

30:51.530 --> 30:52.580
You're holding on very tight.

30:52.780 --> 30:53.710
It's so she doesn't fall.

30:53.910 --> 30:56.130
Why don't you guys go ahead,
and we'll catch it up with you
later?

30:56.330 --> 30:58.670
Fine by me. I'm built for speed.

30:58.870 --> 31:01.010
- You guys have fun.
- Yeah. I'll race you.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.840
- [Connie] Let's do it.
- [Zoey] Thanks.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.300
- [Miles] Okay.
- [Avery] See ya, suckers.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.930
- Can I move my arm now?
- Mm-hmm.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.900
Okay. You're ready.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.700
Ah...

31:14.700 --> 31:17.190
First off, wanna make sure that
your weight is on your front
foot.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.400
- That's what's...
- Okay.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.980
- That's how you're gonna steer.
- So just weight.

31:20.180 --> 31:22.030
- Yeah, like...
- Whoa. Whoa!

31:22.230 --> 31:23.860
- There you go. There you go!
- Hey!

31:24.060 --> 31:25.030
All right, slow down. Slow down.

31:25.230 --> 31:26.630
I can't! Oh! Ah!

31:26.920 --> 31:29.550
Oh! Oh!

31:33.100 --> 31:34.100
You okay?

31:35.760 --> 31:37.710
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, let's take it slow.

31:37.910 --> 31:39.290
- As slow as you need.
- Okay.

31:39.490 --> 31:40.350
- Sound good?
- Mm-hmm.

31:40.770 --> 31:43.690
[yelling]

31:44.690 --> 31:46.050
- Yeah, this is much better.
- [Miles] Walk back.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.020
- I did it.
- You did.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.600
- I did it.
- [laughs] Yeah.

32:24.020 --> 32:24.780
[Connie] Hey, you two.

32:24.980 --> 32:26.170
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:26.370 --> 32:27.610
How was it? Like riding a bike?

32:27.900 --> 32:30.340
I thought I had a pretty solid
run,
the last one.

32:30.540 --> 32:31.430
She did.

32:31.630 --> 32:33.100
- You did great.
- Thanks.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.470
It was the only time
when her face didn't meet snow.

32:35.670 --> 32:37.480
Avery, what is with you this
weekend?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.330
- How's your head?
- Feeling good, yeah.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.060
Like my memory will be back in
no time.

32:42.260 --> 32:43.120
Great.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.610
And then I fell,
and then he helped me get up,

32:46.810 --> 32:48.150
and he was really sweet.

32:48.350 --> 32:49.160
And you made out?

32:49.350 --> 32:50.450
No, no, we were on the mountain.

32:50.650 --> 32:53.410
Well, it sounds romantic.
You gotta admit that.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.790
Fine. Whatever. You're right. It
was.

32:55.990 --> 32:58.250
Yey, look at you.

32:58.450 --> 33:00.630
So how's Zach doing?
How's his memory?

33:00.820 --> 33:01.770
Uh...

33:03.390 --> 33:05.300
Who knows?
It could come back at any time,
really.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.420
Clock's ticking to get
that bathing suit on

33:07.620 --> 33:09.630
and get in that hot tub and call
me back

33:09.830 --> 33:12.600
when things get steamy, pun
intended.

33:12.790 --> 33:15.850
I don't know, Zach's family is
so nice,
and he's so nice.

33:16.050 --> 33:18.350
It just feels... wrong.

33:18.550 --> 33:21.020
[Elle] Every great love story
starts with a love triangle.

33:21.220 --> 33:24.650
"Gone With the Wind,"
"The Great Gatsby," "Lolita."

33:24.850 --> 33:27.320
Maybe I should just get it over
with
and tell him the truth,

33:27.520 --> 33:29.450
and then I can start out honest
with Miles.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.210
- [doorbell rings]
- My food's here. I gotta go.

33:31.590 --> 33:33.120
Zach will get his memory back,
and you can tell everyone

33:33.320 --> 33:34.990
that you honestly did not
wanna be the cause

33:35.190 --> 33:36.620
of any permanent memory loss.

33:36.820 --> 33:38.450
Now go flirt with the only guy
who thinks calculus

33:38.650 --> 33:40.000
is as interesting as you do.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.000
Love you. Bye.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.850
Okay. Love you. Bye.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.900
Why, hello.

33:49.980 --> 33:50.980
Hello.

33:51.730 --> 33:55.950
Green curry with rice,
garlic naan, and a Diet Coke.

33:56.950 --> 33:58.320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:59.070 --> 34:01.020
I-I haven't seen you before.

34:01.220 --> 34:02.690
You must be a new delivery guy.

34:02.890 --> 34:04.690
Yeah, I'm from Chile.

34:04.890 --> 34:06.020
I just moved here.

34:06.220 --> 34:07.270
Cool.

34:07.470 --> 34:09.400
I'm just babysitting.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.150
[both chuckle]

34:11.350 --> 34:13.780
- Uh, so do you go to school?
- Yes.

34:13.980 --> 34:17.160
First to learn English better,
and then to be a doctor.

34:17.360 --> 34:20.200
Oh, very ambitious.
What kind of doctor?

34:20.400 --> 34:22.420
Cardiology. And you?

34:22.610 --> 34:23.920
Uh, I wanna work in publishing.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.590
- You're a writer.
- I am indeed. [chuckles]

34:26.790 --> 34:29.960
I'm a creative writing major,
but my concentration's poetry.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.520
So we both like the heart.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.820
Or... el corazon.

34:36.950 --> 34:39.200
[chuckles] I guess so.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.640
Well, I gotta go.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.520
- Deliveries call.
- Yeah, me too.

34:44.720 --> 34:45.750
Gotta get back to the kids.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.610
They've been too quiet.
Means something's wrong.

34:48.810 --> 34:49.570
Good luck.

34:49.770 --> 34:51.610
See you next time.

34:51.810 --> 34:52.670
Good night.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.690
Why are these called hamburgers
when they're not made of ham?

35:09.690 --> 35:11.260
That's a very good question,
Avery.

35:11.450 --> 35:14.010
Despite the hamburger being
quintessentially American,

35:14.210 --> 35:16.180
it actually originated
in Hamburg, Germany.

35:16.380 --> 35:19.510
However, pizza is most
definitely Italian.

35:19.710 --> 35:22.220
This is just a ploy
to tell us how they met.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.230
- Mm...
- [Avery] Oh, man.

35:23.430 --> 35:25.350
We were both abroad backpacking.

35:25.550 --> 35:26.520
Italy.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.900
The smell of chianti, pizza,
and Bolognese in the air.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.690
[sighs] We know, Dad,
you've told us before.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.200
Well, Zoey doesn't.

35:34.390 --> 35:35.700
I'd love to hear.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.200
We just got out of college.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.950
[Connie] We were just taking our
time
trying to figure out our future.

35:40.150 --> 35:41.540
Two lost souls.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.830
Well, I was literally lost,
and my Italian was failing me,

35:45.030 --> 35:46.250
and nobody spoke English,

35:46.450 --> 35:48.000
and I was trying
to find the train station.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.710
And we bumped into each other,

35:49.910 --> 35:52.940
both of us with our heads buried
in our "Let's Go Europe" books.

35:54.270 --> 35:58.470
Yes, and that was our meet-cute.

35:58.670 --> 35:59.530
I love it.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.660
And you guys seem so compatible.

36:03.530 --> 36:04.530
[Connie] I think we are.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.850
[Avery] You both fell in love
over pizza.

36:09.050 --> 36:10.820
Guess that's why I like it so
much.

36:11.010 --> 36:12.530
Oh, me too. I love pizza so
much.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.000
- [Avery] I know. It's so good.
- Too much, probably.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.800
- Wait, don't I?
- Yes, honey.

36:18.210 --> 36:21.700
- Pepperoni.
- Do you remember owing me $200?

36:21.900 --> 36:25.580
No, no, I... see, I think what
it is,
is you owed me 200 bucks.

36:25.780 --> 36:26.640
Don't even think about it.

36:27.720 --> 36:31.690
Hi, yeah, my delivery guy just
left,
and there's no rice with my
order.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.090
No, no, no,
I don't wanna take it off my
bill.

36:35.290 --> 36:38.220
You know, what's green curry
without rice, am I right?

36:38.420 --> 36:39.530
Have him bring it.

36:41.110 --> 36:42.490
And can you make sure it's the
same guy?

36:44.490 --> 36:45.470
Great.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.870
Thank you.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.460
Hey, wanna watch a movie?

37:00.550 --> 37:01.660
Sure.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.240
What about "Pretty Woman"?

37:03.440 --> 37:05.790
Julia Roberts' only dream
in life is to bag a rich guy.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.540
And not to mention
the unrealistic portrayal of sex
work.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.460
- Exactly.
- Yeah. It's weird.

37:10.660 --> 37:13.690
I just thought... I thought it
was one of your favorites.

37:15.940 --> 37:17.510
What about "Say Anything?"

37:17.710 --> 37:18.720
Mm. Really?

37:18.920 --> 37:20.380
- Oh, really what?
- [Zoey] No, just...

37:20.580 --> 37:23.510
Come on, I don't think
there are any sex workers in
that one.

37:23.710 --> 37:24.510
- No.
- Right?

37:24.710 --> 37:26.240
- But it's boring, and it's...
- What?

37:26.700 --> 37:28.850
Come on, the boombox at the end.

37:29.050 --> 37:31.810
Mm, the grand gesture
where the protagonist

37:32.010 --> 37:34.110
professes their love in public.

37:34.310 --> 37:36.860
It just perpetuates
unrealistic romantic ideals.

37:37.060 --> 37:38.280
Exactly.

37:38.480 --> 37:42.160
Okay, well, I mean,
there's a new Marvel movie...

37:42.360 --> 37:43.490
- Hey.
- That...

37:43.690 --> 37:45.240
You can't watch a movie.
Remember it?

37:45.440 --> 37:47.750
- The doctor said no screens.
- Oh. Yeah. Great.

37:47.940 --> 37:49.120
But guess what we can do?

37:49.320 --> 37:50.180
- [Avery and Connie] Movie.
- Yes.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.370
- [both] One word.
- Mm-hmm.

37:52.570 --> 37:53.640
- [both] Two syllables.
- Yes.

37:54.770 --> 37:58.760
Uh, cold, shivering,
really cold, freezing.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.760
- "Frozen!"
- [Matt] Yes!

37:59.960 --> 38:02.180
Oh, wow! Avery, good job.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.680
Beat that, shit birds.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.010
- Hey, hey. Hey, language.
- Whoa!

38:06.210 --> 38:07.700
Zoey, you're up.

is smart.

this?

Game day?

46:10.640 --> 46:11.830
Game day.

46:12.030 --> 46:15.040
[Zoey] Okay, so the object of
the game
is to capture the opponent's
king.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.840
The queen, however, is the most
powerful,

46:17.040 --> 46:18.630
and she can basically move
anywhere she wants.

46:18.830 --> 46:21.050
[Zach] Okay.
Queen is the most valuable. I
like it.

46:21.250 --> 46:24.430
And the knight moves
in an L-shape like that,

46:24.630 --> 46:27.430
and the bishop moves diagonally
like that,

46:27.630 --> 46:29.410
and the rook moves up and down.

46:30.410 --> 46:31.330
Why do they call it a rook?

46:32.120 --> 46:36.410
Comes from the Persian word
rukh,
R-U-K-H, which means chariot.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.170
You're so smart.

46:40.670 --> 46:44.030
Chess is really like soccer, to
be honest.

46:44.230 --> 46:45.660
The pawns are the defenders.
The bishops are the midfielders.

46:45.860 --> 46:48.540
The rooks are the wingers,
and the queen is the striker.

46:48.730 --> 46:49.950
Your offense, you got your
defense.

46:50.150 --> 46:53.330
I don't think I'm ever gonna
see chess the same way again.

46:53.530 --> 46:56.290

you down.

first.

49:38.050 --> 49:38.890
Do you think it's gonna help?

49:39.970 --> 49:43.730
Constant and the distance
to the edge of the table's 36
inches.

49:45.140 --> 49:48.720
Then the only variable
is the force of the push.

49:48.910 --> 49:50.340
I was gonna say that too.

49:50.540 --> 49:51.320
That's what I was thinking.

49:54.530 --> 49:57.890
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God. Oh, my...

49:58.090 --> 50:01.060
Goal! Math, baby. Don't
underestimate it.

50:01.260 --> 50:03.440
Zoey, that brain of yours
is gonna take you far.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.160
- Oh, my God.
- I don't know about that.

50:06.210 --> 50:08.110
I do. I mean, grad school,
coding.

50:08.310 --> 50:09.780
You know, you've got
a whole career path ahead of
you.

50:09.980 --> 50:11.200
What are you talking about?

50:11.400 --> 50:12.780
Hey, you have a whole
career path ahead of you.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.240
[Zach] No.

50:14.440 --> 50:15.680
Isn't soccer the angle?

50:17.010 --> 50:19.950
I... you know... you know,
I've had soccer my whole life.

50:20.150 --> 50:23.420
I mean, that's the only thing
I've ever really been good at.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.100
But, uh...

50:27.230 --> 50:30.110
Let's be honest, like,
I'm not gonna go pro.

50:32.860 --> 50:36.180
So I have absolutely no idea

50:36.380 --> 50:39.280
what I'm gonna do with my life
after I graduate...

50:41.580 --> 50:46.860
And I'm... I'm pretty...
pretty scared about that.

50:47.060 --> 50:50.110
Zach, you just learned chess in,
like,
20 minutes

50:50.310 --> 50:51.860
- and almost beat me.
- Almost, yeah.

50:52.060 --> 50:54.170
You'd be great at anything.

50:55.550 --> 50:57.160
You think so?

50:57.360 --> 50:58.220
Absolutely.

50:59.340 --> 51:02.390
So other than being
a paper football professional...

51:02.680 --> 51:03.460
[Zach] Right.

51:03.660 --> 51:04.710
What else do you like to do?

51:04.910 --> 51:11.510
[singer singing in Italian]

51:11.710 --> 51:17.360
[up-tempo music playing]

51:45.680 --> 51:47.430
[Zach] Whoo.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.430
- [Zoey] Wow.
- [Zach] Breakfast pizza.

51:55.620 --> 51:57.570
- Don't let the eggs scare you.
- I'm a little scared.

51:57.780 --> 51:58.650
You're a little scared? Trust
me.

52:00.820 --> 52:03.140
Eggs and bacon.

52:03.340 --> 52:04.740
- Yes, like that?
- Mm-hmm.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.580
Cheers. Big old bite.

52:10.210 --> 52:11.210
Mmm.

52:13.380 --> 52:15.570
Mmm. Oh, my God.

52:15.770 --> 52:16.710
[Zach] Mm-hmm.

52:17.550 --> 52:19.050
- This is so good.
- [Zach] Yeah.

52:19.880 --> 52:20.990
No, this is amazing.

52:21.190 --> 52:22.540
No, you're just saying that.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.210
Where did you learn to cook?
Was it your mom?

52:25.400 --> 52:26.260
[Zach] No, I took cooking
classes.

52:27.470 --> 52:29.330
- Seriously?
- [Zach] Yeah.

52:29.530 --> 52:30.340
Well, why are you so surprised?

52:30.530 --> 52:31.800
I mean, I feel like
I would've told you that.

52:31.990 --> 52:35.050
Well, I have to say
I'm very, very impressed.

52:35.250 --> 52:37.070
It's the nicest thing
you said to me all weekend.

52:37.940 --> 52:38.860
No, it's not.

52:41.490 --> 52:43.890
- That's... is that true?
- No, it's...it's fine.

52:44.090 --> 52:45.370
I'm really enjoying getting to
know you...

52:47.120 --> 52:48.120
Over again.

52:50.160 --> 52:53.230
So, um, besides...

52:53.430 --> 52:56.110
so besides chess, like, what
else
do you like to do for fun?

52:56.310 --> 52:57.250
Remind me.

52:58.380 --> 52:59.780
Uh...

52:59.980 --> 53:01.780
N... noth... nothing.

53:01.980 --> 53:03.450
All right, well then that...
that's an obvious sign

53:03.650 --> 53:04.950
- that you need more fun in your
life.
- I'm...

53:05.150 --> 53:06.620
Unless you... do you...
unless you hate fun.

53:06.820 --> 53:07.790
- I don't...
- Do you hate fun?

53:07.990 --> 53:09.220
No, I don't... I... I'm very
fun.

53:09.970 --> 53:11.840
- I love fun.
- You love fun.

53:12.030 --> 53:13.380
I'm the queen of fun.

53:13.580 --> 53:15.230
We will see about that.

53:16.230 --> 53:17.340
[Zoey] Pew, pew, pew.

53:17.540 --> 53:19.180
Pew, pew.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.470
Jesus, this is addictive.

53:21.670 --> 53:22.510
Oh, I know. Yeah.

53:22.710 --> 53:25.390
I mean, it's a great way for
Avery and I
to stay connected when I'm at
school too.

53:25.590 --> 53:26.530
That's really sweet.

53:28.160 --> 53:32.650
You know, I think I remember
ordering her a book on
"Battletoads."

53:32.850 --> 53:34.330
Oh, that was for Avery.

53:35.750 --> 53:36.790
Yeah. Yeah.

53:38.130 --> 53:39.300
Wait, you know about the book?

53:41.380 --> 53:43.320
No, no, I was just saying
that's, uh...

53:43.520 --> 53:46.450
that's really, like,
sweet to buy her a book.

53:46.650 --> 53:48.000
Yeah.

53:48.200 --> 53:50.260
Speaking of books, how's that
one?

53:51.430 --> 53:52.350
I mean...

53:54.140 --> 53:55.550
It's amazing.

53:55.740 --> 53:57.670
I mean, I had no idea women
codebreakers

53:57.870 --> 53:59.860
shortened the war in Germany
by, like, two years.

54:00.980 --> 54:03.390
Yeah. Yeah, it's fascinating.

54:03.590 --> 54:05.260
You know and the way the book,
like, weaves together

54:05.460 --> 54:08.350
the lives of all these women,
captures their voices,

54:08.550 --> 54:09.770
I mean, all under the threat of
war?

54:09.970 --> 54:10.980
It's like I'm actually there
with them.

54:11.180 --> 54:13.450
I mean, it's... it's incredible.

54:15.290 --> 54:18.000
I mean, I feel like you
definitely
could have been one of these
women.

54:19.920 --> 54:20.920
Wow.

54:22.050 --> 54:22.780
That's really sweet.

54:22.980 --> 54:24.030
[door opens]

54:24.230 --> 54:25.240
- [Connie] Hi.
- [Avery] Hi.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.300
Hey. How was the snow?

54:26.760 --> 54:28.840
- [Matt] Great.
- [Avery] Yeah, it was really
good.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.290
Wait, wait.

54:31.490 --> 54:33.370
Are you playing "Battletoads"?

54:33.570 --> 54:36.000
Hey, what happened to no
screens?

54:36.200 --> 54:37.710
I wasn't playing. Zoey was
playing.

54:37.910 --> 54:39.630
I was wearing your sunglasses.

54:39.830 --> 54:41.050
- [Connie] Okay.
- Just in case.

54:41.250 --> 54:43.590
So what did you do? Did you have
fun?

54:43.790 --> 54:45.680
- What didn't we do?
- Excuse me?

54:45.880 --> 54:47.560
- All PG-13.
- Okay.

54:47.760 --> 54:49.850
Oh, shoot,
I forgot my gloves at the lodge.

54:50.050 --> 54:51.600
Avery, don't worry about it.
Zach and I can take you.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.270
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

54:53.470 --> 54:55.400
I think I left them inside on
the table.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.150
- Mm-hmm.
- See you in just a sec.

54:57.350 --> 54:58.570
- Okay.
- Okay.

54:58.770 --> 55:00.650
All... all right, Avery, just
hurry up.

55:00.850 --> 55:02.290
I'll be waiting down here, okay?

55:03.090 --> 55:04.170
All right.

55:07.050 --> 55:08.200
Whoa.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.290
You got a pretty good arm
for a computer nerd.

55:10.490 --> 55:12.250
Hey, nerds rule the world.

55:12.450 --> 55:13.310
- They do?
- [Zoey] Yeah.

55:15.020 --> 55:16.750
You're not gonna throw that
at my head, are you?

55:16.950 --> 55:17.840
[Zach] Huh?

55:18.040 --> 55:20.630
'Cause I can't throw it
at your head, Concussion Boy.

55:20.830 --> 55:22.470
Nobody said
it had to be, like, a fair
fight.

55:22.660 --> 55:23.420
[shrieking]

55:23.620 --> 55:25.890
- [Zach] Oh, gosh!
- Is that all you got?

55:26.090 --> 55:28.180
Oh, you wanna... you wanna see
some,
like, actual competition?

55:28.380 --> 55:30.950
- I didn't know if you were
warmed up.
- Bring it.

55:31.950 --> 55:33.390
Hey, guys! I found them!

55:33.590 --> 55:34.450
Ow!

55:34.910 --> 55:36.980
Shoot, shoot.
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry.

55:37.180 --> 55:38.650
- Oh, sh... you good?
- [Zoey] Yeah.

55:38.850 --> 55:42.250
Hey, it's fully my fault. I'm
sorry.

55:44.090 --> 55:48.130
[soft ethereal music playing]

55:48.510 --> 55:50.450
That may leave a mark.

55:50.650 --> 55:52.550
May leave a mark.
May leave a mark.

56:00.060 --> 56:01.340
Ah, I th... I don't know.

56:01.540 --> 56:04.270
I... I feel like I'm having
déjà vu or something.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.430
There's something I have to tell
you.

56:08.630 --> 56:11.850
Hey, no smooching in front
of your little sister.

56:12.050 --> 56:13.660
Thank you. Thank you, Avery.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.900
- [whispering] Miles kissed me.
- [Elle] In the hot tub?

56:18.100 --> 56:19.810
Oh, my God.

56:20.010 --> 56:22.360
- That bathing suit really never
fails.
- What have you done in that
bathing suit?

56:22.560 --> 56:23.420
Don't you worry about that.

56:23.830 --> 56:24.750
Then I found out he has a
girlfriend.

56:25.210 --> 56:27.110
- Um, what?
- They're poly.

56:27.310 --> 56:28.670
You don't wanna be the third at
the party.

56:29.760 --> 56:33.950
I understand that, and thank God
for Miles
for expanding Zoey's mind.

56:34.150 --> 56:34.950
Right.

56:35.150 --> 56:38.430
But now Zach...
Zach is really surprising me.

56:39.520 --> 56:43.000
He hit me in the head with a
snowball,
and then he kissed me.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.560
And I can't believe
that I'm saying this, but it
felt...

56:46.980 --> 56:48.090
Right.

56:48.290 --> 56:50.850
Do you have amnesia now?

56:51.040 --> 56:52.010
How hard did that snowball hit
you?

56:52.210 --> 56:53.720
It's confusing, right?

56:53.920 --> 56:55.370
Wow. Zach Maclaren.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.350
That's not surprising.

56:57.550 --> 56:59.100
That's revolutionary.

56:59.300 --> 57:00.810
Elle, I need to tell him the
truth.

57:01.010 --> 57:02.480
Wait, hold on. Does he like you?

57:02.680 --> 57:03.480
I don't know, I mean, how much
of it's me

57:03.680 --> 57:05.650
and how much of it's the memory
of Zoey Wallace?

57:05.850 --> 57:08.070
- But you two are vibing.
- [Zoey] Sure.

57:08.270 --> 57:09.700
So the real you
is vibing with the real him,

57:09.900 --> 57:12.620
minus the tiny amnesia detail.

57:12.820 --> 57:14.740
It's not a tiny amnesia, it's a
big detail

57:14.940 --> 57:17.790
and our vibing, whatever it is,
it's duplicitous.

57:17.990 --> 57:19.890
You didn't know that Miles was
poly

57:20.350 --> 57:22.040
or that you were gonna end up
liking Zach.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.710
I mean, give yourself a break.

57:23.910 --> 57:25.340
Elle, I should come clean.

57:25.540 --> 57:28.420
Zoey, wait until Zach has
recovered
then tell him the truth.

57:28.620 --> 57:30.220
That was the original plan,
right?

57:30.420 --> 57:31.220
I like plans that are
straightforward

57:31.420 --> 57:33.680
and follow a logical conclusion
like good code,

57:33.880 --> 57:35.430
not ones that look like
a fried hard drive.

57:35.630 --> 57:39.310
Yeah, but that could be Zach's
brain
if you tell him too soon.

57:39.510 --> 57:41.150
Okay. Thank you.

57:41.350 --> 57:42.290
I have to go.

57:45.250 --> 57:51.260
[warm heartfelt music playing]

58:10.650 --> 58:11.820
- [chuckles]
- Mm.

58:12.650 --> 58:13.820
- Yeah.
- Are you awake?

58:15.320 --> 58:16.320
Yeah.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.820
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:21.040 --> 58:23.770
All right, I'm pretty tired,

58:23.970 --> 58:26.190
so I'm gonna go up and crash.

58:26.390 --> 58:27.250
[Zoey] Of course.

58:31.710 --> 58:34.630
I just wanna thank you
for such a lovely day.

58:35.510 --> 58:38.640
Like I had a wonderful time.
Really.

58:40.100 --> 58:41.810
You sound surprised again.

58:44.640 --> 58:47.020
I think that it just
wasn't what I expected.

58:50.310 --> 58:54.690
You're really full of surprises,
Zach Maclaren.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.110
Well, yeah, I mean, you're...

59:05.160 --> 59:08.040
You're full of surprises,
too, Zoey Wallace.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.080
You okay?

59:20.280 --> 59:21.350
Yeah.

59:22.760 --> 59:23.760
What's wrong?

59:25.980 --> 59:27.100
No, no, it's just...

59:28.600 --> 59:29.600
Um...

59:31.190 --> 59:32.800
I'm just hoping that when you...

59:33.000 --> 59:35.610
when you get back to school
and your memory returns...

59:36.530 --> 59:37.700
That you'll still...

59:38.990 --> 59:41.160
You'll remember this day
and you'll still wanna hang out.

59:43.330 --> 59:45.120
Yeah, of course, I do. Why
wouldn't I?

59:47.000 --> 59:48.210
No, no reason.

59:50.040 --> 59:51.210
I just wanted you to know.

59:58.170 --> 01:00:01.200
[Avery]
Zach, can you come do a monster
check

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.620
Uh, you got it, Avery.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.760
Yeah, I'll be right up.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:11.060
She won't fall asleep
unless I go up, so I...

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:14.170

Why does it say Zoey Miller?
You're Zoey Wallace.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.360
Who's Zoey Wallace?

[car horn honks]

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:29.790
Zach Maclaren, you are so
busted!

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:32.420
- Who are you?
- I'm Zoey, Zach's girlfriend.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.500
But that's Zoey, Zach's
girlfriend.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.500
No, she's not.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.510
- [Connie] I don't understand.
- [Matt] What's going on?

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:39.230
[Zoey Wallace]
That's what I'd like to know.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.400
Uh...

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.190
You're my girlfriend.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.370
Yeah, of course I am.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.900
And... and I hit you with a
soccer ball.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.380
- Yeah.
- I don't understand.

01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:59.650
That's good 'cause I don't,
either.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:00.650
Uh...

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.160
Yeah, let me explain.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.010
So... I know you don't remember
this,
but when you got hit by the
car...

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:08.660
What? When was this?

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.010
No, no, no, no. Let her finish.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.000
You left your credit card
in the store where I work,

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.880
and I ran out to give it to you,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.260
and you didn't see this car
pulling out.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.880
So then you kind of went flying
and you hit your head,

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.680
and when you woke up,
you thought that I was your
girlfriend

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.310
because we have the same name
and I guess we kind of look
alike.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.310
You wish.

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:29.390
I knew something was up.

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:31.100
Then at the hospital,
everyone just thought

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.310
that I was the other Zoey.

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:34.940
And I was gonna tell you the
truth,

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:36.650
but the doctor said that
you had a concussion

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:39.190
and you couldn't handle any
stress,
so I didn't wanna say anything

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:40.650
'cause I didn't wanna make it
worse.

01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:44.410
And then I was gonna tell your
parents
as soon as we got back to your
house,

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:47.490
and I know that this is gonna
sound awful,
but then Miles came over.

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.260
- Wait, who is Miles?
- I am. I'm Zach's cousin.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.120
And I just thought that Miles
and I had so much in common

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.550
that, uh...that...that when
you invited me skiing

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.300
and he's only here for a
weekend,
that I would just...

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.090
I would be the other Zoey, Zoey
Wallace,

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:04.930
Zach's girlfriend.

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:07.260
I am not the other Zoey. You
are.

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.640
But then after Miles and I
kissed...

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.020
What...hey, you kissed my
girlfriend, man?

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.310
We have just established
that she is not your girlfriend.

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:16.980
- What about Emily?
- Yeah, we're poly.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:17.980
- What's poly?
- Math, honey.

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.030
They're...they're talking about
math.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:21.610
It's not Miles' fault. It's
mine.

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.670
Are you into Miles?

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:26.630
I thought that I was, but I'm
not.
Not anymore. No offense.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.450
I felt like we had
a connection this weekend.

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:30.890
We... yes, we did.

What kind of a connection?
You two share a room?

- They wanted to.
- Avery...

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:36.930

thought,
but it doesn't matter now.

bookstore

that was just the title of the

situation
and what I did was wrong.

this?

spiraling.

Well, yeah, of course, I'm
spiraling.

and sometimes that doesn't work
out.

No, I followed your advice.

fault?

if you hadn't pushed me.

- By encouraging me to lie.
- [Elle] No.

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.720
You have never once
been interested in anyone.

that you refuse to let anyone
in.

more
than having surface things in
common.

Yeah, yeah, I know obviously,
or you and Dad would've stayed
together.

when we were in high school.

it was our differences

Why did you get a divorce?

our identities were intertwined,

and we wanted to see
what it was like to be
individuals.

Being together was the only life
we had ever known.

01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.740
But I can promise you it wasn't
about having things in common

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.260
or not having things in common.

easy.

I know ours wasn't.

01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:55.170

and letting your guard down,

I want you to experience that.

It's is about more
than just checking a box

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:04.760
and someone checking a box,
because boxes are boring.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.770
That's probably why
my app didn't take off.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.810
Well, every app needs a good
pivot.

In high school, I told everyone
my prom date was Ryan Reynolds.

- The actor?
- Sorta.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.190
Uh, my cousin's name, uh,
is also Ryan Reynolds,

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:50.700

the real Ryan Reynolds was my
date.
