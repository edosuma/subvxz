On a scale of one to 10,
rocket boarding is totally a 37!

01:49.976 --> 01:53.920
This is Terra Dino.
A pretty decent place to live.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.750
Especially if you're a dinosaur
fanatic, like me.

01:57.850 --> 02:01.654
Did you know that more dinosaur fossils
are discovered in our tar pits

02:01.754 --> 02:04.625
than anywhere else in the world?

02:05.425 --> 02:09.133
If you ever want to come here,
I'm an awesome tour guide.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.639
Sorry, Mr. Hodges.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.983
Ernie Fitzpatrick!

02:24.043 --> 02:25.181
How dare you?

02:27.414 --> 02:29.883
Hey, sis. How was soccer practice?

02:29.983 --> 02:33.286
Mom's gonna be so mad at you. Again.

02:33.386 --> 02:35.889
You know you're supposed to be
watching the store!

02:35.989 --> 02:39.225
Here's a quarter, Jules.
Call someone who cares.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.394
If you can find a payphone!

02:42.795 --> 02:44.823
Got you.

02:45.498 --> 02:50.370
She's kind of right about my mom though.
Her head would explode if she saw me.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.539
But I'm not too worried.

02:52.639 --> 02:56.676
Mom's busy getting ready
for some PTA award ceremony.

02:56.776 --> 03:01.981
The most important part of being
a parent is setting rules.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.624
Thank you for this award.

03:09.822 --> 03:10.924
Ernie, are you on your way?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.227
<i>Yeah, I just stopped
to let Julia borrow some money.</i>

03:14.327 --> 03:16.162
Okay, I'm leaving now.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.899
So I'm gonna put up
the "back in 15 minutes" sign for you.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.000
<i>What do I always say, Ernie?</i>

03:21.100 --> 03:22.468
- Leave a note.
- <i>Leave a note.</i>

03:22.568 --> 03:27.574
So 15 minutes gives you
until 2:53 sharp, okay?

03:27.674 --> 03:29.681
Yep, got it!

03:34.414 --> 03:37.450
I know my mom means well,
but she's always watching me.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.586
I never get a second of freedom.

03:42.889 --> 03:43.890
Hello.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.794
Ernie, are you at the store yet?

03:46.125 --> 03:48.695
- Getting there.
- <i>Okay, well, don't dawdle.</i>

03:48.795 --> 03:52.374
- <i>Just go as fast as you can.</i>
- Okay, Mom.

03:52.832 --> 03:56.669
You heard her.
She said "as fast as I can."

04:04.610 --> 04:11.061
Terra Dino Natural History Museum.
Only the most excellent place on Earth!

04:12.018 --> 04:15.490
And this is Mystery Rock.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.523
See that carving?

04:17.623 --> 04:21.399
It's been dated all the way back
to the Cretaceous Period.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.131
Which is weird,
'cause who could have carved it?

04:25.231 --> 04:29.435
No humans were around
145 million years ago,

04:29.535 --> 04:31.606
just dinosaurs.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.973
Mysterious?

04:34.073 --> 04:36.643
Right. That's where we got the name.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.444
Give them back!

04:38.544 --> 04:40.546
That's my best friend, Max.

04:40.646 --> 04:45.351
He's way cooler than he thinks he is,
which is what makes him so cool.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.825
But sometimes the other kids
don't see that.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.691
Do you think Leonardo da Vinci
got picked on as a kid?

04:51.791 --> 04:53.670
What? Who?

04:55.194 --> 04:57.140
Look, something shiny!

04:57.830 --> 04:58.965
- Shiny?
- What? Where?

04:59.065 --> 05:00.842
Suckers!

05:04.404 --> 05:06.105
Ernie, how's the rocket board?

05:06.205 --> 05:08.879
- On a scale of...
- Thirty-seven, baby!

05:09.008 --> 05:10.109
Boo-yah!

05:10.209 --> 05:14.047
You and your dad totally
outdid yourselves on this one!

05:14.147 --> 05:19.685
Hey, speaking of my dad. He found
new fossil samples at digs 23 and 29.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.554
They're doing
the formal unveiling tomorrow.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.724
Too cool!

05:23.022 --> 05:27.160
- A new exhibit? I can't wait!
- Wait.

05:28.094 --> 05:30.301
But the exhibit isn't open.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.399
And aren't you supposed to be
helping out at your mom's shop?

05:33.499 --> 05:38.004
Dude, you sound like my mom,
with all her "do this, do that" stuff.

05:38.104 --> 05:42.543
Don't you know breaking the rules
is the most important part of being a kid?

05:43.176 --> 05:47.552
The most important part of being
a parent is setting rules.

05:47.947 --> 05:52.404
Once you set rules, the key
is making sure they're followed

05:52.504 --> 05:55.185
exactly the way you want.

05:56.689 --> 06:01.694
I do everything she wants me to do,
just not exactly the way she wants me to.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.229
It's a compromise.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.264
No compromises!

06:05.364 --> 06:10.611
A good goal is to make observance
of the rules a family project.

06:10.970 --> 06:14.307
That, of course,
doesn't mean I endorse tattling.

06:14.407 --> 06:18.850
Ready to begin
Operation Massively Busted.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.390
Oh, the beauty of ancient history.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.588
This is Gallimimus.

06:28.688 --> 06:31.324
He could run up to 20 miles per hour...

06:31.424 --> 06:35.629
Twenty-five miles per hour, dude.
Read a book much?

06:37.497 --> 06:41.801
That, of course, was the Super-
Juvenile-Pain-In-The-Neckasaurus.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.608
Okay, moving on.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.888
Often, kids think
they know more than adults.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.336
They don't know more than adults.

06:59.385 --> 07:01.988
- We can't.
- Oh, but we must.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.166
Keep look out!

07:13.866 --> 07:15.835
This looks complicated.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.772
We'll need a variable algorithm
to sort combination possibilities.

07:19.872 --> 07:24.599
What about the possibility
it isn't locked? Boo-yah!

07:24.944 --> 07:27.646
Oh, yeah. Boo-yah.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.790
I wonder if I'll like prison food.

07:36.622 --> 07:40.793
Tyrannosaurus.
The vicious, bloodthirsty killer.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.095
Attacks without mercy.

07:43.195 --> 07:46.199
Just statues, Max, totally
non-threatening. Here we go.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.172
Constant vigilance.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.706
That's the biggie.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.674
If we let our guard down for one minute,

07:54.774 --> 07:58.685
who knows what kind of trouble
our kids might get into?

08:10.590 --> 08:13.569
Hey, Max! Look! This must be it.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.632
Yeah. But it's covered up.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.664
Too bad. Let's get out of here.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.901
I didn't sneak all the way in here
to see a giant bed sheet.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.138
Come on. Let's pull it off.

08:25.170 --> 08:28.915
- I don't know, Ernie.
- I'll get this corner. You get that one.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.326
Careful!

08:35.514 --> 08:37.183
Hey, what's the deal?

08:37.283 --> 08:40.393
Infrared motion detector.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.924
Wait.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.115
Watch this.

08:53.549 --> 08:56.555
Hang on, we're going in!

09:01.240 --> 09:04.478
Ernie, I totally want to be you
before I grow up.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.651
Oh, yeah.

09:12.218 --> 09:16.856
Okay, now. One, two, three!

09:28.784 --> 09:30.636
- On a scale of...
- Nine hundred.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.471
No offense to the rocket board.

09:32.771 --> 09:34.940
None taken.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.611
"Sarcosuchus."

09:38.711 --> 09:41.881
I sure wouldn't want to meet him
in a dark alley.

09:41.981 --> 09:45.390
With teeth like that,
I wouldn't want to meet him anywhere.

09:45.985 --> 09:50.058
You've fooled Mom
for the last time, Ernie.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.428
Here's your quarter.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.067
Better call a lawyer.

10:05.204 --> 10:07.188
Secure the area!

10:13.079 --> 10:14.581
Stay frosty, boys.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.062
I smell spies from the Science Museum.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.775
Let's ride.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.683
- Seal the perimeter!
- Okay.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.417
- Scale of one to 10?
- Minus 50!

10:51.517 --> 10:55.087
You just learned how to ride this thing
and you can't see where you're going.

10:55.187 --> 10:58.657
Chillax, Max!
I've got this place totally memorized!

11:01.127 --> 11:03.402
I've got them. I've got them!

11:12.304 --> 11:13.506
We're doing it!

11:13.606 --> 11:17.009
I can't believe you doubted me, Max.
I'm a little hurt.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.845
Service exit on the left.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.460
I don't think so.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.406
Thank you for this award.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.309
Got you, you little...

11:49.108 --> 11:55.180
Now let me direct your attention to the
Boy-Are-They-In-Trouble-A-Sauruses.

11:59.852 --> 12:04.767
Okay, can I just point out that
"technically" I didn't disobey you?

12:05.124 --> 12:06.292
Ernie.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.628
You said go to the store
after school, and I stopped by.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.064
There's proof! I left a note!

12:14.400 --> 12:19.371
Yeah, see? I didn't disobey you.
I just took a brief, educational detour!

12:19.471 --> 12:21.741
You did disobey, and you know it.

12:21.841 --> 12:25.482
Plus, the museum was damaged.
Their display was disrupted.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.415
I know, Mom. I'm sorry.

12:29.515 --> 12:33.586
Your actions affect other people, Ernie.
You have to learn that.

12:33.686 --> 12:37.890
I have to be able to count on you,
and someday, others will, too.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.160
I just really wanted to see those bones.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.563
They're fossils, honey.
They've been around for millions of years.

12:44.663 --> 12:48.734
They're not going anywhere.
Now, I'm grounding you for three weeks!

12:48.834 --> 12:51.070
- Mom!
- It's my rule, Ernie,

12:51.170 --> 12:52.805
and no compromising.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.684
Now go to your room and close the door
until I call you for dinner.

13:00.913 --> 13:05.617
"Mother of the year,"
Nobody asked for my vote.

13:08.087 --> 13:12.792
Can't you make your own life interesting
instead of always butting in on mine?

13:12.892 --> 13:16.529
Three weeks!
That's more than you've ever gotten!

13:16.629 --> 13:19.231
I wouldn't have gotten anything
if that alarm hadn't gone off.

13:19.331 --> 13:22.134
- And I know for a fact Max and I...
- Ta-da!

13:25.237 --> 13:28.240
- You!
- Me what?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.718
You are gonna pay for this!

13:34.079 --> 13:36.815
Enjoy your three weeks of house arrest!

13:41.787 --> 13:43.789
It's not fair!

13:46.825 --> 13:48.427
It never ends!

13:48.527 --> 13:52.198
"Time to go to the store, Ernie!"
"Time for violin practice, Ernie!"

13:52.298 --> 13:54.810
"Time to clean your room, Ernie!"

13:55.167 --> 14:00.372
How about some Ernie time?
When can I make my own rules?

14:03.642 --> 14:06.448
There's an open window right next to me.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.125
Any other time I wouldn't think twice.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.822
I can't.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.164
I won't.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.266
But I must.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.272
He's unbelievable.

14:43.382 --> 14:47.086
- Max, open up!
- Coming!

14:51.724 --> 14:54.102
Still a few bugs in my dad's
new door opener.

14:54.893 --> 14:56.767
You think?

14:59.498 --> 15:01.507
Your mom didn't...

15:03.602 --> 15:05.437
Your mom didn't punish you?

15:05.537 --> 15:09.576
No! No! Stop it! Stop it!

15:11.076 --> 15:14.280
Yeah. She grounded me for three weeks.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.417
And yet you're here.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.385
How about your dad?

15:19.485 --> 15:23.388
He says I have to help him in the garage
after school for a month.

15:23.488 --> 15:27.232
- Like I mind!
- Man, who would?

15:27.960 --> 15:33.534
- No, Ernie's mom doesn't let him have soda.
- Ernie's mom isn't here.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.846
Did your garage get bigger?

15:47.946 --> 15:51.550
Yeah. We sold the car
to make room for more experiments.

15:51.650 --> 15:55.959
- Dad! Ernie's here!
- Back here!

16:00.426 --> 16:04.267
Hey, Dr. Santiago!
How's the time machine coming along?

16:04.696 --> 16:07.499
Four years, and still doesn't work.

16:07.599 --> 16:12.113
For a long time I thought
the power key wasn't connected right.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.673
Now I'm pretty sure
it's in the control panel.

16:14.773 --> 16:18.911
Let's see. Chronal stream relay,
calibrated.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.981
Matter transferal gauge, operational.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.319
I just don't know.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.585
You'll get it, Dad.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.787
We'll get it.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.724
You know the vacuuming robot?

16:31.824 --> 16:37.434
I'll bet I can re-purpose its capacitors
for the time machine's power bypass.

16:38.297 --> 16:41.901
A time when I could make my own rules?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.771
- On a scale of one to 10...
- You can't count that high.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.789
No doubt.

16:48.907 --> 16:52.244
Sneaking out and drinking a soda,
double busted!

16:52.444 --> 16:54.146
You tattling twerp!

16:54.246 --> 16:55.647
Three weeks is nothing!

16:55.747 --> 16:59.084
I've got enough pictures here
to get you grounded for three years.

16:59.184 --> 17:03.789
Dudes, be careful! Some of this stuff,
even my dad doesn't know what it might do!

17:03.889 --> 17:05.954
Give me that phone!

17:17.836 --> 17:18.837
Julia!

17:21.306 --> 17:23.351
I didn't do it!

17:39.591 --> 17:43.395
Sneaking out, drinking a soda
and wrecking Dr. Santiago's machine!

17:43.495 --> 17:45.831
Ernie, you are triple busted!

17:45.931 --> 17:48.834
So this is my fault? I don't think so!

17:49.234 --> 17:52.304
You come along and suddenly the fun...

17:52.404 --> 17:54.515
Stops?

18:00.512 --> 18:03.581
Maybe construction down the street?

18:04.883 --> 18:06.251
What was that?

18:06.351 --> 18:11.322
Max? Do you have a pit bull
you never told me about?

18:12.491 --> 18:14.493
This is majorly weird.

18:14.593 --> 18:18.106
Okay. Nobody flip. I'm sure
the control panel just freaked out.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.939
- Julia, are you okay?
- Is it still there?

19:01.039 --> 19:04.646
Yeah, but she doesn't look like
she wants to hurt us.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.789
She almost looks like...

19:07.579 --> 19:09.948
She's smiling?

19:10.621 --> 19:11.823
Great.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.186
Then she won't mind if we go home.

19:14.286 --> 19:18.825
That's a real T-Rex!
Man, I gotta check this out!

19:26.331 --> 19:28.900
Ernie! Quit it!

19:29.000 --> 19:31.870
Don't worry.
She's not even trying to catch me!

19:31.970 --> 19:35.376
Maybe, but she can
take our heads off with her tail!

19:39.044 --> 19:42.280
Relax! Can't you see how cool this is?

19:42.380 --> 19:46.119
Ernie, she might eat us
if we don't get out of here now.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.955
I think the museum

19:50.055 --> 19:53.895
did a really great job
with this new display.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.727
Very lifelike.

20:02.067 --> 20:06.171
It's real! This is all real?

20:06.371 --> 20:09.879
She cleaned him, like a newborn.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.489
It makes sense.

20:24.589 --> 20:28.227
The time machine kind of looks
like an egg when it's all folded up.

20:28.327 --> 20:32.064
Makes sense? Hello, do we look
like baby dinosaurs?

20:37.102 --> 20:39.539
She wasn't calling everyone
to dinner, was she?

20:41.740 --> 20:47.080
No. She was calling everyone
to look at her cute widdle babies.

20:55.687 --> 20:59.760
It almost sounds like they're talking
to each other, doesn't it?

21:00.025 --> 21:03.228
We are so happy for you, Tyra.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.965
Yeah. It was looking like that egg of yours
was never gonna hatch.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.011
Yeah.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.603
The way you've been
like a mother to Orphan

21:11.703 --> 21:15.841
for all these years
is so wonderful, Tyra.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.543
But you deserve children of your own.

21:18.643 --> 21:20.679
You'll still look
after us though, right?

21:20.779 --> 21:23.382
I mean, we don't want those Sarcos
sneaking up on us

21:23.482 --> 21:26.078
when we're grazing or anything.

21:26.178 --> 21:28.430
Come on now, don't worry.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.958
I'm not going anywhere.
All of you are my family.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.060
I'll protect you
from the Sarco Brothers.

21:35.160 --> 21:39.564
And then when my babies are big enough,
they'll protect you, too.

21:43.318 --> 21:47.919
- What do we have here?
- Any stragglers? I'm starving!

21:48.019 --> 21:50.575
Why you... Are you out of your mind?

21:50.675 --> 21:54.178
Are you looking to get extinct?
She could have heard you.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.661
There's something going on here.

22:04.689 --> 22:06.391
What are you looking at? It wasn't me.

22:06.491 --> 22:10.163
I didn't let loose a stinker
or anything, I swear!

22:11.296 --> 22:12.464
Is that right?

22:12.564 --> 22:15.701
Then how come, all of a sudden,
it smells like a sulfur pit around here?

22:15.801 --> 22:17.436
Tell me that!

22:17.536 --> 22:19.975
I think it smells kind of nice!

22:27.512 --> 22:29.348
Just shut up, will you?

22:29.448 --> 22:33.384
The Sarcos wanna know anything
and everything about Tyra!

22:36.354 --> 22:38.661
The plot thickens.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.893
They're definitely gonna
want to hear about this.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.411
Yeah, definitely.

22:43.511 --> 22:45.242
Shush!

22:49.868 --> 22:52.404
Amateurs! If they're not belching,
they're squawking.

22:52.504 --> 22:54.413
If they're not squawking,
they're stepping on things.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.878
They are as weird looking as Orphan is.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.047
They are beautiful.

23:02.147 --> 23:05.684
And they'll grow up big and strong,
like their mother.

23:05.784 --> 23:10.455
Now, everyone, shoo!
My babies need their sleep! Now shoo!

23:10.555 --> 23:11.990
All right, all right.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.398
Now's our chance.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.561
Jules, come on,
we'll just stay for a little while.

23:16.661 --> 23:19.898
We can set the time machine
to bring us back right after we left...

23:19.998 --> 23:23.468
and Mom will never know we were gone!
We won't get in any trouble!

23:23.568 --> 23:26.104
This isn't about getting away
with something, Ernie!

23:26.204 --> 23:29.073
It's about going back where we belong!

23:31.376 --> 23:33.617
Max, how do you get this to work?

23:34.980 --> 23:36.648
Let's see.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.719
Well, first you run
the initialization sequence.

23:40.819 --> 23:44.589
But the initialization sequence
won't even run

23:44.689 --> 23:47.228
because the power key is gone.

23:47.425 --> 23:50.462
What if it fell off
while we were going back in time?

23:50.562 --> 23:53.766
It could be anywhere or anywhen!

23:54.165 --> 23:56.735
I'll give it to them later, okay?

23:56.835 --> 24:02.148
I mean, Dino-Mom thinks we're her kids,
and it'd be rude to just leave, right?

24:04.876 --> 24:09.448
Don't worry, Jules. I'm sure it must've
just fallen off somewhere around here

24:09.548 --> 24:11.817
while we were coming in for a landing.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.120
We'll find it, in a day or two.

24:20.892 --> 24:24.396
Ernie, we're stuck here.

24:24.496 --> 24:27.933
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look around, Jules.

24:28.033 --> 24:32.304
This is Terra Dino
at the peak of the Cretaceous Period.

24:32.604 --> 24:36.341
- And?
- And that's totally awesome!

24:36.441 --> 24:38.510
This is our town!

24:39.010 --> 24:41.746
Millions of years
before we were ever born!

24:41.846 --> 24:44.283
Look, there's Mystery Rock!

24:44.549 --> 24:46.818
And if this nest is near Max's garage,

24:46.918 --> 24:51.388
- then we're probably really close to...
- Home.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.668
Ernie? It's time for dinner.

24:59.564 --> 25:04.272
Come on, Ernie. I know you're upset with me,
but you can at least answer your door.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.914
Julia, did you see where your bro...

25:16.614 --> 25:18.817
"Gone to bust Ernie!" Okay.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.119
It's just a matter of figuring out
where Ernie would go.

25:22.654 --> 25:25.259
He went where he always goes.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.531
Just a minute.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.280
Hey, Sue! Hola!

25:38.870 --> 25:40.872
Hello, Dr. Santiago.

25:40.972 --> 25:44.710
- Oh, please.
- I wish you'd call me... Diego.

25:45.176 --> 25:48.813
- Could you come down from there?
- Oh. Yeah, sorry.

25:48.913 --> 25:54.452
I'm still working out a few kinks
in my robot with the arms and things.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.288
- Sorry.
- Is Ernie here?

25:56.388 --> 25:59.758
Yep, he and Max are in the garage.
I think Julia's here, too.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.760
They're looking at the time machine.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.905
Time machine?

26:12.437 --> 26:15.841
Okay. While she's busy,
let's go exploring.

26:16.007 --> 26:18.044
For the power key. Come on!

26:19.203 --> 26:22.814
Ernie, if you get eaten,
I'll still tell Mom!

26:23.014 --> 26:26.356
Do whatever. I'm having fun.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.325
Hi. Mom?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.060
Mommy. Can I go out...

26:39.731 --> 26:42.701
See? You're not supposed to go anywhere.

26:42.801 --> 26:47.247
There's a way around any mom.
It's just a matter of finding it.

26:48.907 --> 26:50.779
Oh, yeah.

26:53.812 --> 26:54.886
What is it?

27:04.355 --> 27:07.125
Lookee! Your big brother
brought presents!

27:07.225 --> 27:08.560
Let me see them!
Where are they? Where are they?

27:08.660 --> 27:11.563
- Orphan.
- Oh, congrats, Mom! Triplets?

27:11.663 --> 27:15.066
I need to see them. I need to see them.
Where are they? Oh, there they are!

27:15.366 --> 27:17.368
They're different colors!
They're different colors!

27:29.481 --> 27:31.349
I've got siblings.
I've finally got siblings!

27:31.449 --> 27:33.184
You know, someone to play
hide-and-go-eat with!

27:33.284 --> 27:36.154
And on long trips, you know, we'll fight
over who has to sit on Mom's hump.

27:36.254 --> 27:37.689
It will never be me, of course.
You know?

27:37.789 --> 27:40.458
And we'll sing the same songs over
and over. Mostly the songs I like.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.360
And for the rest of our lives
we'll have each other as friends!

27:42.460 --> 27:47.468
Best friends! You know forever and ever.
One question. Why do they look so weird?

27:47.932 --> 27:53.405
- What kind of dinosaur is that?
- No clue. But it's not a T-Rex.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.074
Yeah, no harm done, really.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.943
The security guard
just has to get new pants.

27:59.043 --> 28:02.647
Well, that's not what I'm angry about...
What is that?

28:02.747 --> 28:06.458
Hey, that's not the kids
or the time machine!

28:07.452 --> 28:09.989
So, what is it?

28:10.622 --> 28:12.157
It's a dinosaur egg.

28:12.457 --> 28:15.994
If I'm not mistaken, a T-Rex!

28:16.094 --> 28:17.424
Excuse me?

28:17.529 --> 28:21.666
If there's an egg
from the Cretaceous Period in my garage,

28:21.766 --> 28:25.303
that means matter transferal
must have taken place.

28:25.403 --> 28:28.206
And that means, somehow the kids,

28:28.306 --> 28:30.877
they must have gotten
my time machine to work.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.812
Excuse me?

28:33.912 --> 28:37.315
They've gone back
millions of years in the past.

28:37.415 --> 28:39.384
Excuse me!

28:39.484 --> 28:41.219
Now, don't panic, Sue!
It's just a matter of reversing...

28:41.319 --> 28:44.263
What exactly are you saying?

28:56.034 --> 28:57.702
I really hate this place.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.271
- Will you shut up?
- Sorry.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.406
Mr. Sarco?

29:01.506 --> 29:05.110
Mr. Other Sarco? We're back.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.545
Your prodigal henchmen have returned.

29:07.645 --> 29:11.123
Mr. Sarco? Mr. Other Sarco?

29:17.922 --> 29:19.524
There you are.

29:19.624 --> 29:21.625
Looking good.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.938
What took you idiots so long?

29:35.006 --> 29:37.208
They were out there goofing around.

29:37.308 --> 29:42.080
Let's eat them now before they goof
the meat off their bones.

29:42.180 --> 29:45.561
Don't eat me! I'm mostly fat!

29:46.651 --> 29:51.529
If we don't relocate soon,
we won't have a choice.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.760
With all the earthquakes
and the rising tar,

29:55.260 --> 29:57.862
the pickings are getting slim down here.

29:57.962 --> 30:01.466
Soon, nothing in the Lower Valley
will survive.

30:02.300 --> 30:08.248
And when we get rid of Tyra,
the Upper Valley is ours for the taking.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.811
We need an edge,
which is where you come in.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.947
So you better have brought us
some good news,

30:16.047 --> 30:20.851
or start hoping we can eat you
in just one bite.

30:23.821 --> 30:27.125
We've got news all right, bosses.

30:27.225 --> 30:28.459
News you can use.

30:28.559 --> 30:31.029
Tyra's had babies! Three of them!

30:31.529 --> 30:36.167
Yeah! They're really cute.
You just wanna pinch their widdle cheeks!

30:36.267 --> 30:38.069
More adoptions?

30:38.169 --> 30:40.638
No, she said they were her own!

30:40.738 --> 30:43.982
And it looks like
there's another egg still in her nest!

30:44.909 --> 30:47.311
Another egg?

30:47.712 --> 30:51.182
If it was taken, she'd come look for it.

30:51.282 --> 30:56.324
And then we can take care of her,
once and for all.

31:24.248 --> 31:27.185
My babies' first night of life.

31:27.285 --> 31:31.368
I can't wait to teach them
everything I know.

31:31.468 --> 31:34.859
And one day watch them take down
their first Corythosaurus

31:34.959 --> 31:37.769
with just their bare claws
and their fangs.

31:38.563 --> 31:43.001
You know, it's kind of hard to actually
picture them doing that, but maybe.

31:43.101 --> 31:47.338
- Okay. Into bed with you now.
- Nighty-night.

32:02.653 --> 32:06.258
Now's our chance to go...
to look for the power key.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.794
No way. You are not
leaving me all alone,

32:09.894 --> 32:12.530
millions of years in the past,
in the middle of the night!

32:12.630 --> 32:13.965
Fine.

32:14.065 --> 32:18.436
But we're going in the morning
before our dino-mom wakes up.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.942
Sue! Sue, will you calm down a little?

32:24.342 --> 32:29.814
No! Going back to shaking you
as soon as I catch my breath.

32:29.914 --> 32:32.684
Listen. The time machine
has an automatic system

32:32.784 --> 32:37.889
that returns it three hours after it left
to minimize time stream disruption.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.892
So the time machine
should show up in five,

32:40.992 --> 32:44.598
four, three, two,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.504
One!

32:47.498 --> 32:51.436
I guess the clocks are broken.
Okay, now we go to Plan B.

32:51.536 --> 32:55.176
- What's Plan B?
- Start thinking of Plan C.

33:09.754 --> 33:11.389
Look at it scientifically.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.732
Three pairs of eyes looking for a power key
is better than two, right?

33:16.194 --> 33:19.939
- Do you see anything?
- Nope, nothing back here.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.971
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

33:26.604 --> 33:28.106
That!

33:28.206 --> 33:30.708
Bet it's just that weird
little dinosaur again.

33:30.808 --> 33:34.988
It doesn't sound like that weird little...
It's coming closer!

33:37.348 --> 33:39.883
Okay, maybe you're right.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.694
Hey, wait for me!

33:50.628 --> 33:52.462
Got you!

33:54.298 --> 33:56.600
You can thank me later.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.148
Ernie!

34:17.722 --> 34:20.161
Oh, Mom's gonna be so mad!

34:20.658 --> 34:23.060
Ernie, what do we do?

34:23.226 --> 34:25.103
Grab some logs!

34:35.289 --> 34:37.391
I don't wanna lose my brothers
and sisters! I've just met them!

34:37.491 --> 34:39.815
Wait for me!

34:46.817 --> 34:50.821
- What do we do now?
- Enjoy the ride!

35:27.525 --> 35:28.697
Boulder!

35:52.416 --> 35:55.296
Big, big boulder!

35:57.455 --> 35:59.526
Max, grab on to Julia!

36:01.659 --> 36:05.071
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm inventing a new sport!

36:19.777 --> 36:21.147
Oh, boy!

36:23.914 --> 36:26.317
Ernie!

36:26.417 --> 36:28.094
Oh, great.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.170
Okay, I'm gonna explain the plan
one more time,

36:46.270 --> 36:49.740
and I swear if you don't get it,
I'll dump you in a tar pit myself!

36:49.840 --> 36:52.643
Even if you don't understand,
pretend like you do.

36:52.743 --> 36:55.580
We sneak up on Tyra's nest,
and the first time she walks away,

36:55.680 --> 36:57.523
we go in there and... take the egg.

36:58.249 --> 37:00.906
I'm looking forward
to the sneaking up part!

37:01.006 --> 37:03.918
I'm a really good sneaker!

37:04.989 --> 37:06.324
Something bit me!

37:06.424 --> 37:10.128
What animal would be desperate enough
to bite you, stink bag?

37:10.428 --> 37:11.896
Help him pull it out.

37:11.996 --> 37:16.434
Me? Why do I always have to pull
stuff out of his feet? Why not you?

37:16.534 --> 37:19.270
Because I'm a smacker!
You see? Not a puller!

37:19.670 --> 37:22.539
I am gonna smack him some day.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.743
It tickles!

37:25.843 --> 37:29.614
Hold still, you big-footed bean-brain.
You got crust between your toes!

37:29.714 --> 37:31.350
Oh, that's leftover lizard.

37:31.849 --> 37:33.484
Watch out! You're gonna make me...

37:33.584 --> 37:36.787
- Man, you're disgusting!
- Oh, boy, that was bad.

37:36.887 --> 37:39.290
Will you just pull it out already?

37:39.390 --> 37:42.001
We've got work to do.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.867
Yeah! But never again.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.747
- On a scale...
- Three hundred and fifty!

38:03.247 --> 38:05.054
Boo-yah!

38:14.725 --> 38:16.894
Ernie, is he making fun of me?

38:16.994 --> 38:18.729
Ernie! Ernie! Ernie!

38:18.829 --> 38:21.098
Hey! He can talk!

38:21.198 --> 38:24.836
He's just repeating what we say,
but that's incredible!

38:25.236 --> 38:29.373
You did great, helping us
dodge around all those rocks.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.376
I'm gonna call you Dodger.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.544
Dodger?

38:33.644 --> 38:37.314
Dodger, Dodger, Dodger, Dodger, Dodger!

38:56.100 --> 38:57.301
Check it out.

38:57.701 --> 39:02.506
Alamosauruses!
Those things live like forever!

39:02.606 --> 39:06.510
I told Tyra too much red meat is not good
when you are pregnant, and look!

39:06.610 --> 39:08.314
They're all runts.

39:09.947 --> 39:13.751
Lambeosauruses! Don't worry.
They're strictly vegetarian.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.354
Dude. What are you now?
Like a workout freak?

39:16.454 --> 39:19.657
Haven't you heard?
It's survival of the fittest.

39:19.757 --> 39:22.364
Hey, Pterodactyls!

39:26.797 --> 39:30.701
If those things are gonna protect us
from the Sarcos, we're all dead.

39:30.801 --> 39:33.772
We'll be safer at my mother's. Come on.

39:37.374 --> 39:39.877
This is really amazing!

39:39.977 --> 39:45.416
And you would never have seen this
if I hadn't broken Mom's rules.

39:45.516 --> 39:48.886
Okay, this was worth it. We can go back.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.521
What? To the nest?

39:50.621 --> 39:52.487
No, to...

39:55.125 --> 39:56.160
What's the matter?

39:56.849 --> 39:59.097
Nothing, I...

40:00.298 --> 40:02.535
Looks like Mom's here, after all.

40:11.675 --> 40:17.214
Some sitter you turned out to be, Orphan.
I thought I could trust you with my babies.

40:17.314 --> 40:20.050
They could have gone into the Lower Valley,
and if the Sarcos...

40:20.150 --> 40:21.552
Hey, I was keeping an eye on them.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.154
At least one of my eyes!
Maybe the other eye.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.790
I never know what it's gonna do.
But, Mom, you know, kids are gonna test you.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.125
That's what they do!
Except me, I'm a pretty good kid!

40:28.225 --> 40:32.229
Well, then, if they're going to start
wandering off on their own,

40:32.329 --> 40:36.033
it's time to teach them to survive
without me there to protect them.

40:36.133 --> 40:40.804
Mom, they're a lot tougher then they look.
And they called me Dodger. I kind of like it.

40:52.650 --> 40:53.818
Ernie? Ernie?

40:53.918 --> 40:58.464
I'm coming, Dodger, I'm coming,
but I've gotta find that power key.

40:58.722 --> 40:59.957
Power key.

41:00.057 --> 41:04.495
Don't get me wrong. You and Dino-Mom
are great, and this place is amazing!

41:04.595 --> 41:06.063
Amazing! Amazing!

41:06.163 --> 41:08.666
It's just not home.

41:08.766 --> 41:10.468
Home?

41:10.568 --> 41:12.470
Home! Home! Home!

41:12.570 --> 41:15.739
Was I gonna let some little,
teeny raptor scare me?

41:15.839 --> 41:17.356
Heck, no.

41:25.882 --> 41:27.726
Yeah!

42:01.752 --> 42:02.958
Awesome!

42:15.466 --> 42:17.138
Boo-yah!

43:00.110 --> 43:01.946
Thought of anything yet?

43:02.046 --> 43:07.102
I'm sort of stuck on Max surrounded
by carnivorous dinosaurs. You?

43:07.202 --> 43:09.426
Aren't you supposed to be the scientist?

43:10.020 --> 43:12.022
Yes. Yes, I am!

43:12.122 --> 43:14.425
And I should be approaching
getting our kids back

43:14.525 --> 43:16.936
like any other scientific problem.

43:19.930 --> 43:23.233
Okay, the time machine
moves up the chronal streams

43:23.333 --> 43:25.337
toward their starting point.

43:29.139 --> 43:32.120
- So for the kids to get back to us...
- Wait.

43:33.610 --> 43:35.556
Why do they have to come back to us?

43:36.480 --> 43:40.284
- Is that a trick question?
- No. I mean, we could go to them!

43:40.384 --> 43:43.654
- We don't have another time machine.
- But you built one!

43:43.754 --> 43:46.657
Yes, but it took four years
of trial and error.

43:46.757 --> 43:51.763
That's because you never had the PTA
Mother of the Year managing your time!

45:19.683 --> 45:24.459
Please, just give me half an hour
to find that power key.

45:32.529 --> 45:36.705
I've got to find that power key,
and I can't take no for an answer!

46:00.123 --> 46:02.859
- Max! Where's Ernie?
- Ernie.

46:02.959 --> 46:04.394
- Ernie.
- I don't know.

46:04.494 --> 46:06.770
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

46:10.534 --> 46:12.669
Ernie, what happened to you?

46:12.769 --> 46:15.215
She grounded me.

46:20.243 --> 46:22.180
Ernie! Ernie! Ernie!

46:24.014 --> 46:26.717
Ernie. Max. Max again.

46:26.817 --> 46:29.663
Dino-Mom. Me, Dodger.

46:29.853 --> 46:32.290
Hey, come here a sec!

46:32.556 --> 46:34.695
You guys ever seen tracks
like these before?

46:35.325 --> 46:37.761
- No.
- They're all around the nest.

46:37.961 --> 46:41.967
Like something's been checking it out.
I can't tell where they go.

46:51.875 --> 46:53.977
Jules, come here!

46:54.077 --> 46:58.014
They're coming from the river!
Come on! Let's follow them.

47:03.153 --> 47:05.589
Hey, Mom! Are you gonna let them
leave the nest?

47:05.689 --> 47:08.325
Well, I want to see
where these tracks lead to.

47:08.425 --> 47:11.361
And it'll be good practice for them.

47:11.461 --> 47:15.402
Practice! You know, good thinking, Mom!
That's why you're the mom!

47:20.537 --> 47:23.515
The coast is clear. Come on.

47:23.774 --> 47:26.443
Grab it. Let's go. Let's go.

47:30.647 --> 47:35.118
Quiet. And be careful, don't drop it.
And try not to...

47:39.556 --> 47:42.295
I got it! I got it! Watch the egg.

47:42.592 --> 47:44.595
You scramble that egg,
and I'll scramble you!

47:44.695 --> 47:47.998
Come on! Carrying an egg,
how hard can it be?

47:48.098 --> 47:49.668
The stuff I gotta put up with!

47:57.607 --> 47:59.076
You've still got them, Julia?

47:59.176 --> 48:01.578
Yeah, these marks are a little older,

48:01.678 --> 48:04.681
and I think these ones
are three different sets of tracks.

48:04.781 --> 48:08.518
- Definitely traveling together though.
- You're really good at this.

48:08.618 --> 48:12.898
Almost everything I learned,
I learned from spying on Ernie.

48:15.258 --> 48:18.595
Ernie, what's up? You've been
acting really weird for a while.

48:18.695 --> 48:23.493
- Look, guys, I actually had the...
- Hey, look at this!

48:23.593 --> 48:26.380
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

48:31.174 --> 48:35.012
The tracks come from down there,
a whole other part of the valley.

48:35.112 --> 48:36.718
Let's check it out!

48:38.682 --> 48:39.850
Or let's not.

48:39.950 --> 48:42.241
What's the big deal?
We learned from you.

48:42.341 --> 48:45.007
We can handle whatever is down there.

48:47.624 --> 48:49.359
I don't think she's gonna let us.

48:49.459 --> 48:52.362
Is this how you feel
when Mom tells you no, Ernie?

48:52.462 --> 48:56.633
She knows this place better than we do.
Maybe we should listen.

48:56.733 --> 48:59.807
Did you hit your head or something?

49:00.270 --> 49:02.877
It'd be better than this.

49:03.907 --> 49:07.311
Listen, we have to watch the babies
closer than ever.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.313
I don't want them near the Lower Valley.

49:09.413 --> 49:12.516
No, not the Lower Valley!
The Sarco Brothers are down there!

49:12.616 --> 49:16.053
They got teeth, rows of teeth!
And claws for ripping and shredding!

49:16.353 --> 49:19.222
And then there's the earthquakes
and the boiling hot magma!

49:19.322 --> 49:22.362
And the tar pits.
I'm sure they'll be fine though.

49:34.504 --> 49:37.140
I can't believe that's my car!

49:37.240 --> 49:39.843
Yeah. Looks good, doesn't it?

49:39.943 --> 49:43.747
You know, I've never worked this fast,
or efficiently, in my life.

49:43.847 --> 49:47.420
Then again, I've never had to rescue
my son from the Cretaceous Period.

49:48.018 --> 49:50.328
It's amazing watching you work.

49:50.854 --> 49:53.924
Hey, you know,
you're no slouch yourself.

49:54.024 --> 49:55.525
I was ready to give up and take a nap

49:55.625 --> 49:57.995
before you started screaming
through that bullhorn.

49:58.495 --> 49:59.830
Sorry.

49:59.930 --> 50:04.038
- I can see where Ernie gets his energy.
- Yeah.

50:05.102 --> 50:06.336
To teamwork?

50:06.536 --> 50:08.440
Oh, I don't... I...

50:08.872 --> 50:11.083
Oh, why not?

50:14.711 --> 50:17.047
Maybe I'll just sneak away
and see what's down there.

50:17.147 --> 50:19.216
- Julia!
- Max, she's a dinosaur.

50:19.316 --> 50:22.828
- She can't understand us.
- You're gonna get us in trouble.

50:25.322 --> 50:27.602
The power key!

50:28.892 --> 50:31.972
I didn't think I'd ever get this back!

50:32.762 --> 50:33.864
I mean...

50:33.964 --> 50:38.168
Wait. You didn't think you'd get it back?
What does that mean?

50:38.969 --> 50:43.306
I saw it fall off the time machine,
and I put it in my pocket.

50:43.406 --> 50:44.474
You what?

50:44.574 --> 50:47.344
You guys were in such a hurry
to get back, and I wasn't ready!

50:47.444 --> 50:51.014
I didn't want to go back to Mom
and her rules and being grounded!

50:51.114 --> 50:52.249
Can you blame me?

50:52.349 --> 50:55.986
So instead you made us stay here

50:56.086 --> 50:59.289
where we could have been
eaten by anything?

50:59.389 --> 51:01.725
And then almost got us stranded forever?

51:01.825 --> 51:03.994
It's just like Mom
said about you, Ernie!

51:04.094 --> 51:08.198
You don't care what could happen to other
people as long as you're having your fun!

51:08.298 --> 51:12.835
Okay, look. I found the power key,
so let's just go.

51:19.209 --> 51:20.477
The time machine!

51:22.345 --> 51:24.848
Hey, I didn't take that!

51:25.282 --> 51:27.984
Now we'll never get home.

51:28.818 --> 51:33.790
- Jules, it'll be okay. We'll...
- Don't! This is all your fault.

51:33.890 --> 51:37.861
I miss Mom, but you don't,
do you, Ernie?

51:37.961 --> 51:39.802
Of course I do.

51:42.399 --> 51:44.935
Oh, poor babies.

51:45.035 --> 51:48.215
What's the big deal?
It's just an eggshell.

51:54.210 --> 51:57.481
- Why hasn't Tyra come yet?
- Well...

51:57.581 --> 52:01.258
I thought she cared about this thing.

52:02.221 --> 52:04.387
Could be 'cause we did such a good job.

52:04.487 --> 52:07.891
We're such master thieves,
she don't even know it's gone!

52:07.991 --> 52:09.359
Aren't we great?

52:09.459 --> 52:14.498
She's not coming because what's important
to her really are her babies.

52:14.598 --> 52:17.500
They are so cute!

52:17.801 --> 52:20.071
And so pink!

52:23.240 --> 52:26.076
Let me eat him, please.

52:26.176 --> 52:28.812
If they fail their next mission.

52:28.912 --> 52:34.622
Bring us one of Tyra's babies,
then she'll come.

52:41.391 --> 52:45.134
- Okay. All we need is a plan, right?
- Like what?

52:45.662 --> 52:50.367
Hope we live for 100 million years
so we can see Mom again?

52:50.767 --> 52:52.869
No, but...

52:52.969 --> 52:54.771
But...

52:54.871 --> 52:57.407
Ernie, you are a genius!

52:57.607 --> 52:59.176
What are you talking about?

52:59.276 --> 53:04.114
Jules, what does Mom tell us to do
if we leave the house and she's not there?

53:05.282 --> 53:07.284
Leave a note.

53:07.384 --> 53:11.388
Right! So what if we carve
a note for Max's dad

53:11.488 --> 53:15.192
showing him what he has to do
to get his time machine to work?

53:15.592 --> 53:16.927
To work?

53:17.027 --> 53:21.331
- Which is?
- Just splash soda on the controls!

53:21.431 --> 53:25.335
Right! And we carve it somewhere
we know she'll see it.

53:25.435 --> 53:28.572
- Someplace special, like a landmark.
- Carve it.

53:28.672 --> 53:32.881
Someplace we look at every day.

53:34.010 --> 53:37.080
- Mystery Rock!
- Bingo!

53:37.380 --> 53:38.788
Okay.

53:39.683 --> 53:41.541
Are you finished yet? Is it ready?
Is it finished? Can we try it?

53:41.641 --> 53:44.927
I mean, oh, maybe I should
slow down on these things.

53:47.290 --> 53:49.559
All that's left to do
is to give it a try!

53:49.659 --> 53:51.468
- Come on!
- Hope this works.

54:03.807 --> 54:06.876
I don't get it. I built it
the same way as the other one.

54:06.976 --> 54:09.145
But that one didn't
work either, remember?

54:09.245 --> 54:13.683
Good point, but then the kids
did something to it. Right?

55:01.515 --> 55:03.533
Careful! I know we're in a hurry,
Dr. Santiago,

55:03.633 --> 55:07.605
- but this is a residential neighborhood.
- You can call me Diego.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.250
Careful, Ernie!

55:20.350 --> 55:22.786
I hate you, but I don't want you
to break your leg!

55:22.886 --> 55:25.696
- Jules, this'll work, I know it!
- Work, work.

55:29.826 --> 55:31.428
I say we get that one.

55:31.528 --> 55:33.563
Good. You're elected. Climb that rock.

55:33.663 --> 55:36.873
Well, I meant he should get that one.

55:41.871 --> 55:43.373
Ernie!

55:43.473 --> 55:45.678
Ernie! Ernie.

55:49.179 --> 55:52.492
- Thanks.
- Thanks! Thanks!

56:04.928 --> 56:06.271
Julia!

56:07.063 --> 56:10.243
- Here.
- Here? Here.

56:16.072 --> 56:17.460
Hang on, Julia!

56:19.242 --> 56:21.878
I may have lost the key
and then the time machine,

56:21.978 --> 56:24.652
but I am not losing my sister, too!

56:35.225 --> 56:37.395
Ernie!

56:38.194 --> 56:41.869
Run! Run!
And try not to step on anything!

56:42.699 --> 56:45.739
Give me back my baby!

56:46.169 --> 56:48.905
Give me back my best friend's sister!

57:05.288 --> 57:06.942
Excuse me.

57:16.165 --> 57:18.475
Follow those thieves!

57:27.677 --> 57:29.185
Oh, great!

58:57.281 --> 58:58.334
Excuse us!

58:58.434 --> 59:04.039
Have you seen a newborn carnivorous
prehistoric reptile with very sharp teeth?

59:04.674 --> 59:05.808
Right over there.

59:10.780 --> 59:12.882
Call animal control!

59:12.982 --> 59:14.217
Oh, no.

59:16.252 --> 59:18.664
It went this way. Didn't it?

59:22.158 --> 59:25.730
My store! My merchandise!

59:29.365 --> 59:32.939
We need to trap it, lure it somehow.
The drive-through!

59:37.740 --> 59:41.044
- Welcome to Dino-Burger.
- I need 50 burgers to go as fast as you can!

59:41.144 --> 59:44.047
We're having a promotion
on our pterodactyl tacos.

59:44.147 --> 59:49.254
You heard me, 50 burgers!
And two extra-large sodas.

59:59.962 --> 01:00:01.464
Thanks for the ride!

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:04.575
Tracks! I can follow these.

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.462
No! It's a trap!

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.887
Welcome to our home, Tyra.

01:00:24.987 --> 01:00:28.366
Care to take a little dip
in some hot tar?

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:35.573
Hello? Julia?

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.203
Julia!

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:59.956
Your reign in the Upper Valley
is finished, Tyra.

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.662
We're taking over now.

01:01:15.665 --> 01:01:17.461
The time machine!

01:01:18.219 --> 01:01:20.910
You've got two little babies to protect.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.323
That'll make it twice as hard
to protect yourself.

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:33.322
Sorry, Julia. Pretty lousy rescue.

01:01:33.422 --> 01:01:36.161
- Where's Ernie?
- I don't know.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.370
Oh, man. I've gotta do something.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.409
Come on, Tyra.

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:57.916
Just give up, and we'll make this easy.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:02.686
- Never!
- Then we'll do it the hard way.

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:28.553
Come on! Let's get out of here!

01:02:32.481 --> 01:02:35.285
Find out where those roars came from.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.395
And try not to get eaten.

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.290
That is good advice.

01:02:43.892 --> 01:02:45.528
Come on!

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:50.404
Come and get it, little guy.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:56.015
Yum, yum. That's it.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:01.711
Oh, brother, if the PTA saw me now,
they'd take back their award.

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:04.918
All these trans fats.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.654
- Come on. Come on.
- Almost there.

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:11.028
Just a few more steps.

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:15.197
Got you!

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:32.203
Tyra's baby!

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:47.061
Oh, no.

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:06.275
Finally, a meal we don't have to share
with the Sarcos!

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.785
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:20.495
Did I say jump on me?
When I did say jump on me?

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:23.461
Look at me!

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.065
Boo-yah!

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:32.168
- Dodger!
- Ernie!

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:36.106
Awesome roar! Let's go find Dino-Mom!

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:40.178
At least we landed
in something warm and squishy.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:45.080
Terrific. This is worse than extinction.

01:04:45.497 --> 01:04:47.788
Hey, what's extinction?

01:04:48.692 --> 01:04:49.727
Yeah!

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.489
Hey. That was brilliant!

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:57.626
That's the kind of plan
Max always brags that Ernie makes.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:01.974
He always was smarter
than I gave him credit for.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:06.636
All right, come on.
Let's figure this out.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.513
Let's go.

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:15.250
We're back where we started!

01:05:15.852 --> 01:05:17.781
- Ernie!
- Hey, guys!

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.050
Guys! Guys! Guys!

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.620
- She kept you safe.
- She's been fighting for us!

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.257
Against those things we saw
in the museum, Sarcosuchuses.

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:32.796
I saw them. And I liked them a lot better
when they were just fossils.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:44.238
Ernie!

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:02.961
- The whole place is coming down!
- The time machine!

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:05.509
But Dino-Mom...

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:26.114
Ernie, we don't have much time.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:29.487
Let's go home.

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:38.427
- Wait! We can't just leave her!
- Now, Ernie! We've got to go!

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.062
Hurry up, you guys!

01:06:40.562 --> 01:06:42.803
Ernie, give me the key!

01:06:54.743 --> 01:06:56.083
Dino-Mom.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.580
Ernie! Ernie!

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.582
Are we sinking?

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:02.961
- We're in a tar pit.
- Get us out of here!

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:18.067
Ernie! Ernie! Ernie!

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.970
Ernie, what is it?

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:25.074
Guys, I know how much
getting home means to you,

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.379
but we can't run away from this.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:33.816
You know me, Ernie.

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:36.984
I'm always right behind you.

01:07:58.807 --> 01:07:59.842
Right!

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:05.184
Hey, gator breath, over here! Missed me!

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:15.991
Hey! Over here!

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.363
Earthquake!

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:37.080
You leave my baby brother alone,
you big bully!

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.801
Max!

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.363
No!

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:04.575
Dodger!

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.486
Julia, use the flash!

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.938
See you in the museum.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.084
Oh, boy!

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.788
I'm sorry, Sue. This isn't gonna work.

01:10:59.988 --> 01:11:03.632
Just another Santiago screw up.

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:07.830
It's so ridiculous
how controlling I was.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.502
Did you know at dinnertime
I would sit and actually count

01:11:10.602 --> 01:11:12.534
how many times they chewed?

01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:16.372
And if Ernie ever went outside,
even if he was just going to the backyard,

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:19.183
I always made him...

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.055
Leave a note.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.727
- Sue?
- Wait up!

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.646
Wait a second.

01:11:59.171 --> 01:12:01.226
Wait up!

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.527
Let's go.

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:20.273
Ernie. Dodger.

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:51.859
The kids!

01:12:57.105 --> 01:12:59.108
Ernie! Julia!

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:00.809
- Dad!
- Max!

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.678
Mom!

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.684
- Oh, my darlings.
- I never thought I'd see you again.

01:13:07.115 --> 01:13:08.185
Look out!

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:14.663
Everybody, get down!

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:33.642
You messed with the wrong family!

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:36.422
Well, now you're all dead!

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:49.023
Let me know if the tar's too hot, Sarco.

01:15:06.499 --> 01:15:10.272
- Kids, get behind me!
- Mom, no!

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.449
Ernie, just stay back!

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.113
You're not getting my kids.

01:15:17.245 --> 01:15:19.882
Mom, it's not what you think!

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:25.287
Mom, stop! She found us!
She treated us like we were her kids!

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:26.425
What?

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:32.270
It's true! She even made us
wash our faces!

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:36.231
- Like that.
- That would be sort of disgusting,

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.772
if it weren't so amazing.

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.576
You see it too, Mom?

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:48.816
She's a bigger version of them.

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.299
Mom!

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.267
- Dad!
- Max!

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:15.737
The time machine worked,
just like you said it would!

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:19.942
And that thing that almost ate us,
was that a Sarchosuchus?

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.687
- Yeah!
- Outrageous!

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:28.351
She looks so sad.

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:32.620
See if this cheers her up.

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:01.858
Let's get out of here.

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:01.980
Thanks for taking care of us.

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:04.713
And for not eating us, of course.

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.817
Thanks, Mom.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:10.118
You know, I'm gonna miss this place.

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:14.189
The smell of the plants,
the sounds of the jungle,

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:16.811
the dinosaur fights.

01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:20.068
I'll miss you, too.

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:22.219
Come on, Ern!

01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:25.132
Thanks again for everything.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.440
And watch out for those tar pits!

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.507
- Goodbye!
- Adiós!

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:33.608
We'll miss you!

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.844
Bye.

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:54.396
So, how'd you figure out that you
had to spill soda on the controls?

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:58.367
- I saw the carvings on the rock.
- Except I never got the chance, Mom.

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:02.908
I went chasing after Jules.
So how'd it get there?

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:05.712
Dodger, Dodger, Dodger!
