In that case, they should solve

- What’s their evidence?
- Nothing forensic. It’sjust police work.

01:40.268 --> 01:44.352
The remains were found
in the possession of
a Norwegian black-metal band.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.974
What’s black metal?

01:46.065 --> 01:48.772
I don’t know. It’s Norwegian.
Whole different kind of black.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.316
Apparently, it’s a genre
of heavy metal...

01:51.404 --> 01:55.113
featuring macabre imagery
ofdeath and horrific violence.

can give us something.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.698
What’s, uh—
What’s the story on this?

02:39.785 --> 02:42.367
The posterior ribs
were either broken
or severed.

02:42.455 --> 02:45.947
[Brennan]
Detached at the spine
and then Ianned out.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.782
It’s the Blood Eagle.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.367
Beg pardon?

02:49.462 --> 02:52.625
It was an ancient torture in which
the victim was held facedown...

02:52.715 --> 02:55.081
while his back was sliced open.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.918
The ribs were then broken
at the spine...

02:58.012 --> 03:00.344
and then spread
to look like an eagle.

03:00.431 --> 03:02.513
Thus the name.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.387
Absence of blood on the
periosteal surface ofthe fracture...

03:05.478 --> 03:08.060
suggests the ribs
were broken postmortem.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.934
I’ll remove the bones
from the cross and clean ’em.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.687

- This is definitely murder.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.734
There are other possibilities.

03:15.821 --> 03:19.029
I have to admit

03:46.936 --> 03:48.927
Ah, Gordon-Gordon, huh?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.356

came back negative for embalming fluid.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.099
So he was never buried
in a sanctioned grave.

05:15.191 --> 05:17.147
So probably murdered.

It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Sweets.

06:04.073 --> 06:07.657
Dr. Wyatt, I am a huge admirer
ofyour book...

06:07.743 --> 06:10.826
on the role of sexual sadism
in female serial killers.

06:10.913 --> 06:14.030
Do I detect a certain caveat
in yourtone?

06:14.124 --> 06:17.662
Uh, well, the sample is small.

06:17.753 --> 06:21.541
Well, comparatively speaking,
there are few female serial killers.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.214
I was wondering ifyou had
a chance to take a look at—

06:24.301 --> 06:26.292
Your manuscript. Yes, indeed.

06:26.387 --> 06:30.300
And may I say, Dr. Sweets,
that I think this is probably...

06:30.391 --> 06:32.473
the best work I have ever read...

06:32.560 --> 06:35.222

06:35.312 --> 06:39.681

a common... cause.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.982
Okay. Now I’m hearing a caveat.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.402
It’s a small one.
It’sjust that Brennan and Booth...

06:45.489 --> 06:47.980
aren’t in any way opposites.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.157

07:01.297 --> 07:06.212

What about the sexual component
in their relationship?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.130
Ah.
Would you agree that they have both,

07:09.221 --> 07:12.384
uh, sublimated their attraction
to each other out of fear...

07:12.474 --> 07:15.637
of endangering their working relationship
because their working relationship...

07:15.728 --> 07:17.309
is paramount to both ofthem?

07:17.396 --> 07:19.261
Alas, I’m afraid
I wouldn’t agree with that.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.561
No.
Wow. Which part?

07:22.651 --> 07:24.983
Well, everything you just said.

Yes, one ofthem is acutely aware
ofthat attraction.

I’m sorry I keep saying that.
But which one?

07:37.333 --> 07:39.369
It’s your book, Dr. Sweets.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.701
I would never tell you
what to write.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.537
I was actually gonna ask you
to write the introduction.

But I’m retiring.

pretty close to the vest.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.289
Yeah. Kind of ruins

is Todd or Larry.

09:13.721 --> 09:17.964

is gonna quit psychiatry?

09:24.523 --> 09:27.515
Well, I asked him to write the intro
to my book about you two...

09:27.609 --> 09:29.520
and he told me he couldn’t
because he was retiring.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.269
Is it possible he
just hated your book?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.327
Okay, why would a man
with Wyatt’s insights...

09:40.414 --> 09:43.622
into the human psyche
want to be a mere sCIentist?
No offense.

09:43.709 --> 09:48.624
Perhaps because psychology is
a field which is ill-defined
in conception...

09:48.756 --> 09:50.917

10:00.392 --> 10:02.178

- Yeah.

10:02.269 --> 10:06.387
But our vict/m ’s skeleton was found
in the possession of a Norwegian
black-metal bano’.

10:06.482 --> 10:09.098
Death metal, black metal—
what’s the difference?

10:09.193 --> 10:12.276
In essence, death metal is about
brutal technical proficiency,

10:12.362 --> 10:14.102
while black metal
is about emotion.

10:14.198 --> 10:18.111
Now both of them exploit
adolescent feelings of
alienation, depression—

10:18.202 --> 10:20.944

- But historically, picayune,

there’s no way to track
down this band, Spew.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.812
No bars, clubs or high schools.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.865

of I 20—year-old black oak.

Episcopal Church six months ago.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.326

Well, I read his book.
And as is the case with most writing,

26:55.156 --> 26:59.149
it reveals more about the writer
than about the subject matter,
which, in this case, is you.

Can you provide an example?
For one thing,

your childhood experiences with him.

Did he ever bleed from his ass?
Because that’s where we found
the bullet fragments.

that the gunshot wound
to the victim’s ilium...

28:30.167 --> 28:31.828
occurred 70 months prior
to his death.

the blank with a real bullet.

No. I think you knew
that the bullet was there.

shot the guy in the neck

with the spine.

being garroted?

The puncture occurred
on the back ofthe neck.
But what would do that?

Yeah.

Yes. His ex-girlfriend is right.

32:02.505 --> 32:05.588

the mainstream would be seen
as the ultimate betrayal.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.710
Mmm. Like leaving a cult.

32:07.802 --> 32:11.920
We think that the victim
was garroted, most likely
with barbed wire.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.972
Now the murderer will lay claim.
He’ll keep a souvenir.

32:15.059 --> 32:17.516
Yes. In the same way
that a serial killer will.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.514
Right. But it isn’t
for his own satisfaction.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.597
It’s a way of boasting of what
he’s done to the community.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.307
Yeah, it’s a totem,
a signifier of some kind...

32:25.402 --> 32:27.609
that can only be discerned
by the cognoscenti.

gonna figure this out?

Mm—hmm. And according
to one ofyour squint reports,

out ofthe victim’s ass?

Well, only because
I was on desk duty.

Now, that bullet could be
a good totem pole.

A totem, Booth.
A totem pole is much larger.

33:15.411 --> 33:19.245

it would be a good totem—
pole or otherwise.
