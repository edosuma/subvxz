00:00.830 --> 00:02.627
ABOUT YOURSELF, MRS. HARKNESS.

00:02.630 --> 00:03.722
>> MY HUSBAND TREATS ME LIKE A

00:03.730 --> 00:05.493
STRANGER.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.060
>> WE DO GOOD WORK HERE, BUT WE

00:08.070 --> 00:09.332
CAN'T PROMISE TO SAVE OUR

00:09.340 --> 00:10.329
PATIENTS FROM INSENSITIVE

00:10.340 --> 00:12.171
SPOUSES.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.375
>> NO, I MEAN IT LITERALLY. MY

00:14.380 --> 00:16.177
HUSBAND HAS ALZHEIMER'S. HE

00:16.180 --> 00:18.273
DOESN'T RECOGNIZE ME ANYMORE.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.448
[SIGHS] DO YOU THINK YOU COULD

00:23.450 --> 00:27.216
MAKE ME LOOK LIKE THIS? THIS IS

00:27.220 --> 00:29.188
THE WOMAN HE REMEMBERS, THE

00:29.190 --> 00:31.124
WOMAN HE LOVES. HE TOOK THAT

00:31.130 --> 00:32.620
PHOTO ON OUR 20th WEDDING

00:32.630 --> 00:34.222
ANNIVERSARY. DO YOU THINK YOU

00:34.230 --> 00:35.356
COULD MAKE ME LOOK LIKE THIS

00:35.360 --> 00:36.520
AGAIN? MAYBE IT WOULD JOG HIS

00:36.530 --> 00:37.622
MEMORY.

00:37.630 --> 00:39.769
>> HERE'S MY PROBLEM. IT WOULD

00:39.770 --> 00:41.294
TAKE SEVERAL SURGERIES TO

00:41.300 --> 00:42.699
RECREATE THIS FACE, AND TH EY'D

00:42.710 --> 00:43.836
ALL HAVE TO BE DONE AT ONCE IF

00:43.840 --> 00:45.102
YOU'RE RACING AGAINST YOUR

00:45.110 --> 00:46.873
HUSBAND'S MENTAL DETERIORATION.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.108
WE'D HAVE TO PUT YOU OUT FOR

00:48.110 --> 00:49.805
MANY HOURS, AND, FRANKLY, WE

00:49.810 --> 00:51.107
DON'T LIKE TO KEEP PATIENTS YOUR

00:51.110 --> 00:52.316
AGE UNDER ANESTHESIA FOR THAT

00:52.320 --> 00:54.641
LONG. ADDITIONALLY, AFTER ALL

00:54.650 --> 00:57.517
THAT WORK, YOU STILL RUN THE

00:57.520 --> 00:58.384
RISK OF HIS--

00:58.390 --> 01:00.119
>> OH, I KNOW. I KNOW. HE MIGHT

01:00.120 --> 01:02.156
NOT RECOGNIZE ME. I'VE BEEN ALL

01:02.160 --> 01:05.379
THROUGH THAT. IT'S WORTH THE

01:05.390 --> 01:10.464
RISK. I NEVER SAID THIS OUT LOUD

01:10.470 --> 01:15.794
BEFORE, BUT IT'S MY FAULT. I

01:15.800 --> 01:18.234
KNOW IT IS. HE'S FORGOTTEN ME

01:18.240 --> 01:21.209
BECAUSE I ABANDONED HIM. MOST OF

01:21.210 --> 01:22.677
OUR MARRIAGE, I WAS ALL ABOUT

01:22.680 --> 01:25.569
CARL. AND THEN, AFTER MENOPAUSE,

01:25.580 --> 01:26.911
I GOT THIS SUDDEN SURGE OF

01:26.920 --> 01:28.649
ENERGY, AND I JUST STARTED

01:28.650 --> 01:30.447
WRITING THESE LITTLE MURDER

01:30.450 --> 01:31.917
MYSTERIES. AND CARL WAS VERY

01:31.920 --> 01:34.309
SUPPORTIVE OF ME. HE EVEN READ

01:34.320 --> 01:36.220
MY DRAFTS FOR ME, BUT THEN WHEN

01:36.230 --> 01:37.788
HE EXPRESSED FEELINGS OF MISSING

01:37.790 --> 01:40.759
ME, I WAS PRETTY MUCH, "DON'T

01:40.760 --> 01:43.365
RAIN ON MY PARADE." AND THEN I

01:43.370 --> 01:44.667
CALLED HOME ONE NIGHT I WAS ON A

01:44.670 --> 01:46.558
BOOK TOUR IN LONDON, AND HE

01:46.570 --> 01:51.269
CLAIMED NOT TO KNOW WHO I WAS.

01:51.270 --> 01:54.831
HE SAID HIS WIFE HAD RUN AWAY,

01:54.840 --> 01:57.206
AND I BECAME ANGRY, AND I TOLD

01:57.210 --> 01:58.802
HIM HIS SENSE OF HUMOR WAS VERY

01:58.810 --> 02:01.540
PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE. AND THEN, 3

02:01.550 --> 02:02.915
DAYS LATER, MY SON CALLED AND

02:02.920 --> 02:04.842
TOLD ME THAT THEY FOUND HIM

02:04.850 --> 02:06.556
WANDERING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN

02:06.560 --> 02:10.326
HIS PAJAMA BOTTOMS, FILTHY AND

02:10.330 --> 02:12.753
DEHYDRATED, AND HE COULDN'T

02:12.760 --> 02:15.422
REMEMBER WHICH HOUSE WAS HIS.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.966
AND, BASICALLY, HE'S NEVER

02:16.970 --> 02:20.929
RECOGNIZED ME AGAIN.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.761
>> I AM SO SORRY.

02:23.770 --> 02:28.537
>> DOCTOR, HAVE YOU EVER HURT

02:28.540 --> 02:30.974
ANYONE YOU LOVED IN SUCH A WAY

02:30.980 --> 02:34.370
THAT DOESN'T EVEN SEEM LIKE YOU?

02:34.380 --> 02:37.349
BUT THEN YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND

02:37.350 --> 02:40.319
MAKE IT DIFFERENT.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.891
IT'S A KIND OF PAIN I NEVER

02:50.900 --> 02:53.596
COULD'VE IMAGINED.

03:03.410 --> 03:04.843
I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S ANY WAY

03:04.850 --> 03:06.408
I CAN CONVINCE YOU TO COME WITH

03:06.420 --> 03:08.274
ME AND MEET HIM, AND SEE HOW IT

03:08.280 --> 03:09.383
IS WITH US?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.584
>> MRS. HARKNESS, YOU SEEM LIKE

03:10.590 --> 03:12.717
A LOVELY WOMAN, AND I'M MOVED BY

03:12.720 --> 03:14.585
YOUR SITUATION. IF I COULD

03:14.590 --> 03:15.955
CONVINCE MYSELF IT WAS MEDICALLY

03:15.960 --> 03:17.450
SOUND, I'D DO THE WORK IN A

03:17.460 --> 03:19.519
HEARTBEAT. BUT I CAN'T JUSTIFY

05:46.170 --> 05:48.001
NOT THAT SURPRISED.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.509
MANIPULATE ME INTO DROPPING THE

06:16.510 --> 06:18.068

06:18.070 --> 06:19.799
YOU DO THAT, I SHOULD REPORT

YOU. THEY SAID THESE EVENTS ARE

WHAT? THEY'RE RIGHT. I TOLD THEM

08:11.620 --> 08:12.609

12:15.160 --> 12:21.030
HEALED JUST LIKE ME. AND I'M

12:21.040 --> 12:31.109
AVOIDING IT. I THINK THIS IS AN

12:31.110 --> 12:33.840
OPPORTUNITY. I WANT TO TREAT

12:33.850 --> 12:36.978
HER.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.446
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

12:38.450 --> 12:40.054
>> IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED. IF

12:40.060 --> 12:42.085
I HELP HER THROUGH HER PAIN, I

12:42.090 --> 12:44.183
CAN EXPERIENCE MY OWN. LET IT

12:44.190 --> 12:48.593
G0. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE

12:48.600 --> 12:51.865
BOTH NEED TO WORK ON, SEAN.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.278
>> PICK UP THE PHONE, MATT.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.204
PLEASE. DON'T PRETEND I'M NOT

13:06.210 --> 13:11.011
HERE. WE HAVE TO TALK. THIS IS

13:11.020 --> 13:15.081
THE WRONG WAY TO--

13:15.090 --> 13:16.489
>> I'VE BEEN TO SEE 3 OTHER

13:16.490 --> 13:17.923
SURGEONS. THEY ALL TURNED ME

13:17.930 --> 13:20.091
DOWN. I CAME BACK TO YOU BECAUSE

13:20.100 --> 13:21.499
I KNOW YOU'RE AN UNDERSTANDING

13:21.500 --> 13:23.024
SOUL.

13:23.030 --> 13:24.429
>> I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC, MRS.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.369
>> COME WITH ME TO MEET CARL. NO

13:27.370 --> 13:29.930
PROMISES. JUST AN HOUR OUT OF

13:29.940 --> 13:31.407
YOUR LIFE THAT MIGHT CHANGE MINE

13:31.410 --> 13:34.129
COMPLETELY.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.081
>> CARL? YOU HAVE VISITORS.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.648
>> HI, SWEETHEART. I BROUGHT

13:48.660 --> 13:51.049
SOMEBODY TO MEET YOU. THIS IS

13:51.060 --> 13:55.019
DR. SEAN MCNAMARA. THIS IS CARL.

13:55.030 --> 13:59.990
>> GOOD TO MEET YOU, CARL.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.434
>> WOULD YOU JOIN US OVER HERE?

14:06.070 --> 14:07.571
HAS HE EATEN ANYTHING TODAY?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.138
>> NO, AND IF HE DOESN'T START

14:09.140 --> 14:10.141
EATING SOON, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

14:10.150 --> 14:12.277
PUT HIM ON AN I.V. WE DON'T

14:12.280 --> 14:22.212
WANNA DO THAT, DO WE CARL?

14:22.220 --> 14:25.485
>> CARL? I BROUGHT YOU A GUAVA

14:25.490 --> 14:28.926
PASTRY.

14:28.930 --> 14:31.319
>> YOU LOOK WORRIED, CARL.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.696
>> I DON'T KNOW HER.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.430
>> CARL, I'M YOUR WIFE ELLIE,

14:36.440 --> 14:38.237
AND I COME EVERY DAY, AND TODAY

14:38.240 --> 14:39.707
I'VE BROUGHT YOU YOUR FAVORITE

14:39.710 --> 14:41.974
PASTRY FROM ALBA'S. REMEMBER

14:41.980 --> 14:43.641
ALBA'S? WE USED TO WALK THERE

14:43.650 --> 14:44.674
EVERY DAY, AND WE'D GET A

14:44.680 --> 14:48.446
CORTADITO AND A GUAVA PASTRY.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.958
I JUST KEEP TRYING. I DON'T

14:55.960 --> 14:59.157
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.129
>> CARL, YOUR WIFE WORRIES ABOUT

15:02.130 --> 15:03.722
YOU. SHE WANTS YOU TO EAT MORE

15:03.730 --> 15:05.664
SO YOU KEEP YOUR STRENGTH UP.

15:05.670 --> 15:14.533
>> DO YOU KNOW MY WIFE? SHE'S

15:14.540 --> 15:22.379
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. SHE NEVER

15:22.380 --> 15:25.281
COMES TO SEE ME.

15:30.090 --> 15:32.285
>> YOU MUST BE VERY LONELY

15:32.290 --> 15:35.259
WITHOUT YOUR FAMILY, CARL.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.637
>> JUST ONE LITTLE BITE,

15:41.640 --> 15:42.698
SWEETH EART. COME ON.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.066
>> IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, YOU TWO.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.538
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOVIE.

15:57.050 --> 15:58.210
>> I'M SO GRATEFUL YOU TOOK ME

15:58.220 --> 15:59.380
ON.

15:59.390 --> 16:00.755
>> IT'S THE LEAST WE COULD DO,

16:00.760 --> 16:03.422
MS. REYNOLDS.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.058
>> SORRY. DR. MCNAMARA HAD

16:06.060 --> 16:08.051
ANOTHER APPOINTMENT, AND HE

16:08.060 --> 16:13.532
ASKED ME TO SIT IN. HI, I'M DR.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.598
COSTA.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.737
>> I WAS JUST TELLING DR. TROY

16:15.740 --> 16:17.401
HOW YOU'VE ALL BEEN SO AMAZING

16:17.410 --> 16:18.604
IN THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THE

16:18.610 --> 16:19.599
VICTIMS.

16:19.610 --> 16:22.238
>> OH, WELL, THAT IS THE DIRTY

16:22.240 --> 16:23.309
LITTLE SECRET WE DOCTORS SHARE.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.505
IT FEELS GOOD TO HELP OTHERS.

16:25.510 --> 16:28.547
>> OH, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

16:28.550 --> 16:30.609
AFTER I GAVE MY STATEMENT TO THE

16:30.620 --> 16:32.417
POLICE, I PICKED UP THE PHONE

16:32.420 --> 16:34.308
AND I CALLED STAND UP. YOU KNOW,

16:34.320 --> 16:35.810
THE VICTIMS' RIGHTS GROUP?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.651
YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM?

16:37.660 --> 16:40.128
>> YES, OF COURSE.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.791
>> THEY DO SUCH GOOD WORK.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.268
ANYWAY, A LADY CAME RIGHT OVER.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.362
SHE STAYED WITH ME ALL NIGHT.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.190
SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN BRUTALLY

16:47.200 --> 16:49.361
STABBED BY HER HUSBAND 16 TIMES,

16:49.370 --> 16:51.429
SO SHE KNEW HOW TO RELATE TO ME.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.499
>> HOW FORTUNATE.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.375
>> SHE TOLD ME THIS QUOTE.

16:55.380 --> 16:58.372
"VICTIMS ARE BUT LITTLE LOWER

16:58.380 --> 17:00.268
THAN THE ANGELS." SHE WAS SAYING

17:00.280 --> 17:02.248
WE DON'T NEED TO BE DESTROYED

17:02.250 --> 17:04.343
SOULS, THAT GOD HAS CHOSEN US,

17:04.350 --> 17:06.409
GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME

17:06.420 --> 17:08.809
BACK STRONGER, MORE

17:08.820 --> 17:12.426
COMPASSIONATE THAN EVER BEFORE.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.091
I THINK THIS ATTACK MAY HAVE

17:14.100 --> 17:15.749
BEEN THE MIRACLE I'VE BEEN

17:15.760 --> 17:20.265
LOOKING FOR ALL MY LIFE.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.294
>> MIRACLE?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.767
>> IT GAVE ME PURPOSE. AFTER YOU

17:22.770 --> 17:24.738
FIX ME, I'M GOING TO TAKE THE

17:24.740 --> 17:26.207
TRAINING PROGRAM, AND DEDICATE

17:26.210 --> 17:28.235
MY LIFE TO HELPING OTHER PEOPLE.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.832
>> A WORD OF ADVICE, MS.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.671
REYNOLDS. DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB

17:31.680 --> 17:32.874
BEFORE YOU'VE LANDED BACK ON

17:32.880 --> 17:37.647
PLAN ET EARTH.

17:37.650 --> 17:39.641
>> I'M SORRY. HAVE I OFFENDED

17:39.650 --> 17:41.311
YOU, DR. TROY?

17:41.320 --> 17:44.323
>> NO, I'M JUST UNCOMFORTABLE

17:44.330 --> 17:46.423
WITH ALL THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL

17:46.430 --> 17:47.852
RHETORIC. IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE

17:47.860 --> 17:49.851
AVOIDING SOMETHING.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.669
>> I'M AVOIDING HELPLESSNESS.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.228
>> I'M AFRAID MY COLLEAGUE

17:53.240 --> 17:54.730
PLAYED HOOKY DURING THE BEDSIDE

17:54.740 --> 18:00.679
MANNER COURSE IN MED SCHOOL. MS.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.705
REYNOLDS, SHALL WE MOVE ON TO

18:02.710 --> 18:05.372
THE SURGERY?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.742
>> BASED ON YOUR CARDIO WORK-UP,

18:10.750 --> 18:12.513
5 HOURS IS THE MAXIMUM TIME I

18:12.520 --> 18:14.750
WANT YOU UNDER. SO I'VE CHOSEN

18:14.760 --> 18:16.216
THESE PROCEDURES FOR OPTIMUM

18:16.220 --> 18:17.926
RESULTS IN A LIMITED TIME FRAME.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.579
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO HEAR

18:19.590 --> 18:20.898
ALL THIS? I'D SAY 90% OF OUR

18:20.900 --> 18:22.299
PATIENTS PREFER TO REMAIN IN THE

18:22.300 --> 18:23.324
DARK.

18:23.330 --> 18:24.888
>> THIS SURGERY IS MY LIFE NOW.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.697
I THRIVE ON EVERY DETAIL.

18:26.700 --> 18:30.636
>> OK. WE START WITH THE FAT

18:30.640 --> 18:31.902
DEPOSITS AND SKIN OVER THE

18:31.910 --> 18:34.435
EYELIDS.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.812
WE WON'T TAKE OUT ALL OF IT

18:42.820 --> 18:44.481
SINCE WE KNOW FROM THE PHOTO

18:44.490 --> 18:45.514
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD SLIGHTLY

18:45.520 --> 18:48.250
HOODED EYES.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.922
WE'LL JUST CUT ALONG THE LOOSE

18:54.930 --> 18:56.397
SKIN HERE.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.628
>> MY PRADA BAGS, AS MY

18:57.630 --> 19:00.736
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW CALLS THEM.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.709
>> THAT LEAVES US ABOUT 3 HOURS

19:18.720 --> 19:19.914
AND 15 MINUTES FOR YOUR

19:19.920 --> 19:22.354
RHYTIDECTOMY.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.968
>> RHYTIDECTOMY SOUNDS LIKE A

19:33.970 --> 19:35.733
WILD ANIMAL IN AFRICA.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.435
>> NOT QUITE. IT'S YOUR FACE

19:37.440 --> 19:39.305
LIFT.

19:57.390 --> 19:59.688
AFTER THE INCISION, WE USE A

19:59.690 --> 20:01.624
TISSUE EXPANDER TO MAKE THE SKIN

20:01.630 --> 20:04.292
MORE SUPPLE.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.804
AND THEN, MY FAVORITE PART OF

20:10.810 --> 20:12.539
THE PROCEDURE, WE USE BLOOD

20:12.540 --> 20:13.734
WE'VE TAKEN FROM YOU EARLIER,

20:13.740 --> 20:17.506
AND TURN IT INTO A NATURAL GLUE.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.019
I HOLD IT IN PLACE FOR 3

20:25.020 --> 20:26.840
MINUTES. IT CLOSES ALL THE DEAD

20:26.850 --> 20:28.454
SPACE, AND AIDS IN NATURAL

20:28.460 --> 20:29.757
TISSUE HEALING BECAUSE IT'S FROM

20:29.760 --> 20:32.684
YOUR OWN BODY.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.363
ANY QUESTIONS?

20:38.370 --> 20:42.033
>> JUST ONE. ARE YOU THIS KIND

20:42.040 --> 20:45.407
TO ALL YOUR PATIENTS?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.968
>> YOU ASKED ME IF I EVER HURT

20:46.970 --> 20:48.904
SOMEONE CLOSE TO ME IN A WAY I

20:48.910 --> 20:55.645
DEEPLY REGRET. I'M LIKE YOU. I

20:55.650 --> 20:58.778
WANNA BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.849
>>*LALALA,

21:00.860 --> 21:03.351
LA-LA LA-LA LA-LA,

21:03.360 --> 21:07.729
LA-LA-LA LA-LA-LA *

21:14.970 --> 21:17.803
>> MS. REYNOLDS, BEFORE I SEND

21:17.810 --> 21:20.870
YOU OFF TO SURGERY, I OWE YOU AN

21:20.880 --> 21:22.472
APOLOGY.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.675
>> BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

21:24.680 --> 21:25.749
>> I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST YOU.

21:25.750 --> 21:26.978
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT. I'D LIKE

21:26.980 --> 21:28.345
TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR

21:28.350 --> 21:30.443
VICTIMS' RIGHTS ORGANIZATION.

21:30.450 --> 21:35.854
>> THANK YOU.

21:35.860 --> 21:39.352
>> I ALSO FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO

21:39.360 --> 21:41.351
TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT

21:41.360 --> 21:43.863
SOMETHING. I WAS ALSO A VICTIM

21:43.870 --> 21:45.826
OF THE CARVER.

21:45.830 --> 21:52.008
>> OH, GOD. I HAD NO IDEA.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.979
>> LISTENING TO YOUR STORY WAS

21:54.980 --> 21:59.371
DIFFICULT FOR ME. IT WAS HARD

21:59.380 --> 22:03.612
FOR ME TO ACCEPT HOW REMARKABLY

22:03.620 --> 22:05.838
YOU'VE DEALT WITH YOUR ATTACK,

22:05.850 --> 22:07.715
WHEN I'M STILL RESENTFUL AND

22:07.720 --> 22:09.756
STRUGGLING WITH RESIDUAL ISSUES.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.628
I WAS HARSH, AND I'M SORRY.

22:16.660 --> 22:18.423
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:18.430 --> 22:19.590
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN TALK

22:19.600 --> 22:22.489
ABOUT IT. WOULD YOU MIND IF WE

22:22.500 --> 22:25.003
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.739
>> I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID

22:26.740 --> 22:28.605
TALKING ABOUT IT MADE YOU FEEL

22:28.610 --> 22:29.679
BETTER.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.874
>> IT'S JUST WHEN I START TO

22:30.880 --> 22:33.713
TALK ABOUT IT, I FEEL...REALLY

22:33.720 --> 22:37.144
SICK. UM, I FEEL FOR YOUR PAIN,

22:37.150 --> 22:41.086
YOU KNOW? BUT I HAVE TO TAKE

22:41.090 --> 22:42.717
CARE OF MYSELF. I'M ABOUT TO GO

22:42.720 --> 22:44.028
INTO SURGERY HERE. I CAN'T GET

22:44.030 --> 22:46.919
ALL EMOTIONAL.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.797
>> OF COURSE.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.200
>> NOW, ABOUT MY FACE, I WANTED

22:58.210 --> 22:59.507
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT MY

22:59.510 --> 23:02.502
NOSE. I'VE ALWAYS HATED IT. DO

23:02.510 --> 23:03.602
YOU THINK YOU COULD MAKE IT

23:03.610 --> 23:04.645
PRETTIER, SINCE I'M GONNA BE

23:04.650 --> 23:06.902
UNDER ANYWAY?

23:06.910 --> 23:07.911
>> AFTER EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN

23:07.920 --> 23:09.547
THROUGH, I'D SAY RHINOPLASTY IS

23:09.550 --> 23:11.142
THE LAST THING YOU NEED.

23:11.150 --> 23:12.117
>> WHAT ABOUT MY LIPS? COULD WE

23:12.120 --> 23:14.816
PLUMP THEM UP OR SOMETHING

23:17.060 --> 23:19.654
>> MS. REYNOLDS, I THINK WE

23:19.660 --> 23:22.754
SHOULD DISCUSS ELECT IVE SURGERY

23:22.760 --> 23:25.866
AT A LATER DATE.

23:34.210 --> 23:35.802
>> DADDY, WHY DO THEY CALL IT

23:35.810 --> 23:38.677
"HIGH TEA"?

23:38.680 --> 23:40.568
>> I DON'T KNOW, SWEETHEART.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.487
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. WE'RE FROM

23:45.490 --> 23:47.117
FAMILY SERVICES. I'M MS. JAMES,

23:47.120 --> 23:48.815
THIS IS MR. RISKIN. ARE YOU MR.

23:48.820 --> 23:49.889
MCNAMARA?

23:49.890 --> 23:51.755
>> DR. MCNAMARA. HOW CAN I HELP

23:51.760 --> 23:52.829
YOU?

23:52.830 --> 23:53.854
>> WELL, WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM

23:53.860 --> 23:54.952
ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

23:54.960 --> 23:56.552
CENTERS REPORTING AN INCIDENT

23:56.560 --> 23:58.699
INVOLVING YOU AND YOUR SON.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.567
>> THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME. MY

24:01.570 --> 24:02.832
DAUGHTER AND I ARE ON OUR WAY

24:02.840 --> 24:04.068
OUT.

24:04.070 --> 24:05.207
>> WHEN ONE OF THESE REPORTS

24:05.210 --> 24:06.632
COME IN, WE'RE REQUIRED BY LAW

24:06.640 --> 24:07.800
TO QUESTION OTHER FAMILY

24:07.810 --> 24:08.936
CHILDREN. WE'LL NEED TO SPEAK

24:08.940 --> 24:10.874
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. WHAT'S YOUR

24:10.880 --> 24:12.177
NAM E?

24:12.180 --> 24:14.546
>> ANNE KATHERINE MCNAMARA.

24:14.550 --> 24:16.745
>> HOW'S YOUR HEARING? NOW'S NOT

24:16.750 --> 24:17.944
