WEBVTT

01:22.499 --> 01:24.418
Watch your head.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.996
Nice.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.206
This is beautiful.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.417
We've gotten lucky here.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.336
We've seen them before,

02:08.378 --> 02:11.465
but they bloom only in certain conditions,

02:11.506 --> 02:13.675
when the water level is very low.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.511
So to have stumbled upon a bloom

02:16.553 --> 02:18.722
of this exciting magnitude

02:18.764 --> 02:21.433
is really... it's lucky.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.477
So, I'm really excited.

02:28.732 --> 02:32.486
It's kind of surprisingly hard to catch.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.615
It's like you almost don't feel it.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.410
These strange, squiggly slimes

02:40.452 --> 02:42.370
form on the walls.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.165
And these are really...

02:45.206 --> 02:48.961
They're probably the most beautiful slime I've ever seen.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.463
We don't understand how they form.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.090
It's still a mystery,

02:53.132 --> 02:55.467
but we know they're made by life.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.477
This question of how much of the universe is understood

03:05.519 --> 03:07.855
is very much a moving target.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.902
Because as we are able to stand in a new place,

03:13.944 --> 03:15.654
because we've learned something new,

03:15.696 --> 03:17.405
we then see other wonders

03:17.447 --> 03:19.491
that were not even visible to us before.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.719
Wait, wait, wait...

05:02.761 --> 05:04.096
Let us in.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.305
That's forbidden.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.599
Do I get points for pedestrians?

05:09.059 --> 05:11.186
How can this be the right way?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.648
-[horn honks] -Yeah, yeah.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.569
He's late for lunch.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.197
That's why he's impatient. He's late for lunch.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.451
We are headed for physics lab

05:26.493 --> 05:29.788
to talk to a physicist

05:29.830 --> 05:31.581
in the physicist habitat,

05:31.623 --> 05:34.542
which is always interesting to see, you know,

05:34.584 --> 05:37.129
an organism in its natural habitat.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.881
So, I'm a microbiologist

05:39.923 --> 05:43.342
and I'm hoping that the physicist

05:43.384 --> 05:47.181
will be able to communicate

05:47.222 --> 05:50.267
what he does and why,

05:50.309 --> 05:52.769
in terms that I can understand.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.690
I'd like to keep an open mind about this.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.406
[speaking Italian]

06:09.828 --> 06:11.997
[Italian]

06:13.414 --> 06:15.542
You need to fill in some forms.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.212
-So the disclaimer... -I love forms. I love forms.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.006
Okay, and then we can eat some lunch in the cafeteria.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.009
Oh my God, look at him! He's awesome.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.054
The hair.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.764
Galileo, Newton...

06:29.806 --> 06:31.975
D'Angelo.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.269
[Davide] Okay, dark matter is something,

06:34.311 --> 06:36.479
we do not know what it is.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.398
We believe the dark matter is there,

06:39.440 --> 06:42.319
but we have never detected it.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.655
It's good, this cafeteria?

06:45.697 --> 06:48.742
It's better than the average cafeterias, I would say.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.328
<i>Buongiorno. Ciao.</i>

06:52.829 --> 06:56.291
So I'm sorry, but you won't like this lunch much.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.459
[Jennifer speaks Italian]

06:59.753 --> 07:02.339
-What is dark matter? -Okay. We don't know.

07:02.381 --> 07:05.759
[laughs] That's great. That's why it's called dark.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.052
[Davide] Exactly.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.136
Do you know we have dark matter

07:08.178 --> 07:09.637
in microbiology too?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.223
That's still the word.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.432
What do you use it for?

07:12.473 --> 07:14.226
Well, we...

07:14.268 --> 07:16.561
We have some evidence that there are something like

07:16.603 --> 07:19.606
35 trillion microbial species.

07:19.647 --> 07:20.857
Mm-hmm.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.902
And we've met about...

07:23.944 --> 07:24.903
a million?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.238
Mm-hmm.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.073
So the rest is dark matter.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.617
-Okay. -Yeah, we stole it.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.327
I admit it.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.955
Yeah. I think it makes sense,

07:34.996 --> 07:37.416
because we...

07:37.457 --> 07:40.919
What we call dark matter is

07:40.961 --> 07:42.337
some kind of new particle

07:42.379 --> 07:44.131
which we haven't discovered yet.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.510
[Jennifer] So, the hypothesis is

07:49.552 --> 07:51.346
that dark matter is out there

07:51.388 --> 07:54.224
because it's consistent with all of our observations.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.768
-[Davide] Exactly. -And so,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.812
it might not be out there.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.688
But we think it is,

08:00.730 --> 08:02.523
-because of what we... -I think we detect it.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.985
-We cannot say we are sure. -Uh-huh.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.862
All observations point in that direction.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.698
-This is very mysterious. -This is very mysterious, yes.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.911
[Davide] Dark matter is one of the big unknowns

08:14.953 --> 08:17.789
in particle physics.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.583
Of all matter that should be out there,

08:20.625 --> 08:24.212
about 85% of this is invisible.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.256
These particles are moving through us,

08:26.298 --> 08:28.342
through our bodies while we're talking

08:28.383 --> 08:31.552
and most of them just go without any interaction.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.223
So how are you going to find it?

08:35.265 --> 08:36.766
How are you going to detect it?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.025
So...

08:45.066 --> 08:46.734
why are we here?

08:46.776 --> 08:49.070
[chuckles] Why are we here?

08:49.112 --> 08:50.405
We are here, under about

08:50.447 --> 08:53.074
1,800 meters of rock.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.869
We are deep underground because all the experiments here,

08:55.910 --> 08:58.663
whether they look for dark matter or for neutrino

08:58.705 --> 09:01.582
or for any other kind of rare event,

09:01.624 --> 09:04.503
they need to be shielded from the cosmic radiation.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.673
There are protons or ions

09:08.715 --> 09:10.050
that heat the atmosphere.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.386
They create a shower of particles

09:12.427 --> 09:15.055
that hit us above ground.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.140
And the mountain is a filter for this.

09:17.182 --> 09:20.768
So if you go here, you have the so-called cosmic silence.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.603
-Cosmic silence? -Cosmic silence.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.524
We're here in the cosmic silence under the mountain.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.108
I love that.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.651
So, you can't hear the cosmic rays here.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.446
I would love to see the new detector.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.906
Okay.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.616
-It's not ready yet. -Okay.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.536
So this is your new experiment?

09:37.577 --> 09:40.497
Yes. This is a prototype still.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.250
It will prove the old detector concept.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.877
Okay, so this dark matter that we think exists,

09:45.919 --> 09:47.879
but we're not that sure...

09:47.921 --> 09:50.465
The crystal that you're going to put inside here

09:50.507 --> 09:52.217
is going to help you?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.469
It's going to be the best possible detector

09:54.511 --> 09:56.430
-that you know how to build? -Yes.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.056
There's crystals inside there.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.226
How do you see what the crystal is seeing?

10:01.268 --> 10:04.229
How does the crystal talk to you on the outside?

10:04.271 --> 10:05.855
It emits light, and then you have

10:05.897 --> 10:07.857
two photomultipliers on each side.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.402
Then you read the photomultipliers...

10:10.444 --> 10:12.028
-They go out? -...that go out to here.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.280
It's very simple.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.698
[chuckles]

10:15.740 --> 10:17.158
Yeah. See, the lights?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.911
My friend, the dark matter physicist.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.788
What's simpler than that?

10:25.750 --> 10:28.378
[Jennifer] I keep having to, like, loosen my helmet,

10:28.420 --> 10:31.172
'cause my head is getting bigger by the minute.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.673
I...I'm...

10:32.715 --> 10:34.509
I have to say that I was starting from

10:34.551 --> 10:36.177
pretty much zero on dark matter.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.556
So, this is what I understand about how it works.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.642
We are rotating within a sea of dark matter particles.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.353
There is a, uh...

10:46.980 --> 10:48.022
container?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.941
So we build a,

10:49.983 --> 10:52.527
a detector, which is a...

10:52.569 --> 10:54.112
which, whose core is a...

10:54.154 --> 10:57.574
Special, very carefully grown crystal.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.451
A sodium iodide crystal.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.536
When the crystal gets hit

11:01.578 --> 11:03.663
by this dark matter particle...

11:03.704 --> 11:06.333
You see a tiny flash of light.

11:06.374 --> 11:11.338
That light is going to be detected by these devices

11:11.379 --> 11:14.257
that are sticking into the edge of the container.

11:14.299 --> 11:17.594
And those devices then translate the light

11:17.636 --> 11:21.055
into an electronic pulse that goes to a computer

11:21.097 --> 11:23.141
that says, "Hey, dark matter particle.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.725
I'm here."

11:24.767 --> 11:26.186
So, if you just had to...

11:26.227 --> 11:28.271
I know this is not what we do but,

11:28.313 --> 11:30.231
if you just had to guess,

11:30.273 --> 11:31.566
where are the...

11:31.608 --> 11:33.527
where is the dark matter?

11:33.568 --> 11:35.236
-Can you guess? -No.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.030
-You would not... -Science is not about guessing.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.073
I know, I know. It's not about guessing.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.076
But I mean, sometimes I dream about a result that I might get.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.372
I can tell you this. So here, you also see the models.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.706
The models

11:47.748 --> 11:50.460
foresee dark matter in this area here.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.753
Extra dimensions models foresee

11:52.795 --> 11:55.215
dark matter in this area here.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.634
-These other guys, it's going to be here, so...

11:55.256 --> 11:57.634
-So we have no idea.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.554
Some other guys would place it here, so we have no idea.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.890
In my field, I would say 10 years ago,

12:03.931 --> 12:05.684
if you asked me

12:05.724 --> 12:07.852
where would we be now today,

12:07.894 --> 12:10.438
I would've had a very hard time answering.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.566
Because we're really... We're not just...

12:12.607 --> 12:14.817
We're not just... We're not just...

12:14.859 --> 12:17.487
We're not just filling in the details.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.280
We're looking into some dark abyss

12:19.322 --> 12:22.367
where we just can't see very far in.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.620
And depending on where the flashlight shines first,

12:25.662 --> 12:28.540
we might go a different direction completely.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.041
So, it's very hard when you're

12:30.083 --> 12:31.876
right on the edge of this big unknown.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.254
It's very hard to say where

12:34.295 --> 12:36.548
the science is going to go next.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.383
Is that where

12:38.425 --> 12:42.262
dark matter physics is now, or is it...

12:42.303 --> 12:45.848
Is there something analogous?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.766
We are surely on the verge of something.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.768
We don't know what it is.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.358
[Davide] It's so unbelievable that there is

12:55.400 --> 12:57.611
so much more matter in the universe

12:57.652 --> 13:00.988
than we have realized so far.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.366
We don't know what it is. I mean, it's a...

13:03.408 --> 13:06.160
We need to find out if this is true.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.204
If there's really dark matter out there,

13:08.246 --> 13:10.873
if there is another explanation which we haven't thought about,

13:10.915 --> 13:13.000
because science is also this.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.377
Sometimes you spend

13:14.419 --> 13:16.045
several years looking for something,

13:16.087 --> 13:18.256
and then in the end, it's not there,

13:18.298 --> 13:20.300
and you have to change

13:20.341 --> 13:22.927
the way you were thinking of things.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.889
Okay, I'm going to the toilet.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.225
Do you want to shoot that too?

13:29.267 --> 13:30.977
Oh, look at that.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.482
You guys! This is incredible!

13:35.523 --> 13:37.233
These are stalactites.

13:37.275 --> 13:40.153
Do you see? It's a soda straw.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.782
This place wasn't here 20 years ago.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.659
-So it cannot be. -No, it can be.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.826
-Can it? -I think, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.870
I'd like to know what it's made out of.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.373
It could be salt,

13:52.415 --> 13:54.459
and then it can grow very fast.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.918
See, all these stains?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.713
They're all all light-harvesting microbes.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.964
All of them.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.424
The red color is one kind.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.883
The dark color is another kind,

14:02.925 --> 14:04.594
The green one is another one.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.471
[Davide] So you have flavors, like neutrinos?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.389
-Flavors of microbes? -Yes.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.016
-We have flavors of microbes. -About how many do you have?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.934
We have 35 trillion flavors.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.312
Okay, that's more than... than the three flavors we have.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.480
-Yeah. -I guess.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.107
Yours are sterile or not?

14:18.149 --> 14:19.984
-Ours are not sterile. -Not sterile?

14:20.026 --> 14:23.363
No, we don't know any sterile flavors yet.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.323
That could be, that would be...

14:26.449 --> 14:28.117
Oh, that's an interesting question.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.995
There's this problem in... in biology

14:31.037 --> 14:34.290
where... we think all the life,

14:34.332 --> 14:36.917
all of the 30 trillion species

14:36.959 --> 14:40.129
have descended from a common ancestor.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.507
But... and that means

14:42.549 --> 14:44.884
it's easy for us to see them,

14:44.925 --> 14:47.011
because we know what to look for.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.055
But if there were another ancestor...

14:49.096 --> 14:51.558
we wouldn't be able to see it

14:51.599 --> 14:53.893
'cause we don't know what to look for.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.279
[Jennifer] How long have we been looking for this stuff?

15:05.321 --> 15:06.698
This dark matter?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.867
How long have we been looking for it?

15:10.493 --> 15:12.078
[Davide] At least 20 years.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.706
From the research, many more.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.791
Okay, so that's... Yeah.

15:16.833 --> 15:20.253
Of course, if you see dark matter, you win

15:16.833 --> 15:20.253
the Nobel Prize.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.672
But if you don't, you're going to make

15:22.714 --> 15:24.507
-a good publication anyhow. -You'll still feel good.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.050
So what makes you different?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.344
What makes you willing to search after something

15:28.386 --> 15:31.806
-that we don't even really know exists?

15:28.386 --> 15:31.806
-It must be there. Come on.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.933
Where do you get that, though?

15:36.977 --> 15:39.647
[Davide] Science is a journey

15:39.689 --> 15:42.942
to take you somewhere where you've not been before.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.781
Some people prefer to concentrate on life sciences.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.533
Some others prefer to understand

15:50.575 --> 15:52.493
how the universe was built.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.704
I mean, I've studied only physics, so I don't know

15:54.746 --> 15:58.958
what my mind would be if I had studied a different subject.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.655
I feel absurd.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.700
Those two days in Gran Sasso

16:32.742 --> 16:35.411
weren't enough to get used to this.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.833
[man] Where are we going now?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.544
You mean today?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.505
I don't have the faintest idea.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.466
I want to be shocked.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.514
-Hey. -Hi! Davide.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.474
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, yeah.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.434
-So you're Davide? -Yeah.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.854
-You know I'm a psychologist? -Yeah, I know.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.981
But I don't know what you do to study.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.566
So, I really have no idea.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.235
I can imagine something like the<i> Ghostbusters</i> scene

17:08.277 --> 17:10.029
where you show me cards and I have to guess which one...

17:10.070 --> 17:12.198
Yeah, no. Don't worry.

17:14.534 --> 17:18.955
[Axel] My main research interest is consciousness.

17:18.997 --> 17:23.001
How and why the biological activity of the brain

17:23.042 --> 17:25.962
produces conscious experience.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.797
So, Professor...

17:32.092 --> 17:35.137
No, I'm not going to psychoanalyze you.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.018
We work mostly on consciousness.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.603
Consciousness has been described

17:42.645 --> 17:44.731
as one of the most significant problems

17:44.772 --> 17:46.774
of the 21st century,

17:46.816 --> 17:49.443
on a par with the origins of the universe

17:49.485 --> 17:53.781
and the origins of life and these super big questions.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.993
It really remains a sort of mystery

17:57.035 --> 18:00.580
to figure out how the biological activity of the brain

18:00.621 --> 18:03.583
produces minds, basically mental states.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.836
One of the difficulties with studying consciousness

18:06.878 --> 18:09.338
is that it is a private phenomenon.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.131
I know I'm conscious.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.800
I think you are conscious, because you behave in ways

18:12.842 --> 18:15.053
because you behave in ways that I...

18:15.094 --> 18:16.888
expect to be associated with consciousness,

18:16.930 --> 18:18.890
even though I cannot really define it.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.475
But, the point is I do not have access

18:21.517 --> 18:24.270
to your own mental states, right?

18:24.311 --> 18:26.397
So, we have two experiments planned.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.816
You're not going to stick pins through my head, no?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.693
No, but... But if you're willing,

18:30.735 --> 18:33.237
we're going to put electrodes around your head.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.655
Oh yeah. Why not?

18:34.697 --> 18:36.574
See if you can make a...

18:36.616 --> 18:39.786
robotic hand move by your thoughts.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.373
Ready?

18:51.380 --> 18:56.343
I always thought I would've donated my brain to science.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.640
[Axel] What we're trying to do here, through learning

19:00.681 --> 19:02.934
what thoughts to imagine

19:02.976 --> 19:04.602
so that the hand will move,

19:04.644 --> 19:07.981
what the distinction is between thinking that

19:08.022 --> 19:10.066
and thinking something else where it doesn't move,

19:10.108 --> 19:11.484
and so on and so forth.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.152
The argument, the crucial argument,

19:13.193 --> 19:14.821
is that this is not built in.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.115
During your development, you have to learn.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.993
Your brain has to learn to interact with your body.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.496
Agency is part of what it means to be conscious.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.081
Each three seconds,

19:25.123 --> 19:27.166
you will see a red arrow, pointing to the right,

19:27.207 --> 19:28.501
appearing on the screen.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.794
And when you see this red arrow,

19:29.836 --> 19:31.378
you have to imagine a movement.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.714
Given that this is a right robotic hand,

19:33.756 --> 19:36.342
it's better if you imagine movement of the right hand.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.072
[motor whirring]

20:02.242 --> 20:04.162
This one is intentional.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.917
This one is intentional.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.794
This one, not.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.844
-Is that okay? -Yeah.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.847
I would like to spend here a week and master this thing.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.725
Yeah, there's lots of interesting physics

20:22.889 --> 20:25.725
questions to be asked.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.144
I'd like to explore all the different movements.

20:29.687 --> 20:33.607
Do you now feel you have some control over that hand?

20:33.649 --> 20:34.984
-Partial. -Yeah?

20:35.026 --> 20:36.485
Partial.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.320
So that's about sense of agency reading.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.157
-But there's also... -If I can really focus,

20:41.199 --> 20:45.995
in a sense of... excluding any noise,

20:46.037 --> 20:47.454
Then, I get like...

20:47.496 --> 20:50.750
four of five movements right.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.377
But then, when I start thinking about what's going on...

20:53.419 --> 20:57.256
-Yeah. It's fragile. -It's fragile, then I lose it.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.093
But, so the idea is that it gets less and less fragile,

21:00.134 --> 21:01.594
or more and more robust.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.137
That's true. Even in these ten minutes...

21:03.179 --> 21:05.890
As expertise goes on.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.101
Until the point where...

21:08.142 --> 21:09.894
you don't have to do anything special.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.187
Basically, your...

21:11.229 --> 21:12.980
All this effortful thinking

21:13.022 --> 21:14.899
that you're doing just goes away,

21:14.941 --> 21:17.359
and you just will the finger to move and it moves.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.319
And that's what happens.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.822
That is what happens with natural bodies,

21:19.361 --> 21:21.822
with our own bodies.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.742
It's important in this context to remember that

21:24.784 --> 21:27.120
consciousness is not one thing, right?

21:27.161 --> 21:29.288
It's different kinds of mechanisms

21:29.329 --> 21:32.125
which together characterize

21:32.166 --> 21:33.417
the adult human mind,

21:33.459 --> 21:35.920
which we know is a conscious mind.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.591
If you're an empirically-oriented scientist,

21:40.633 --> 21:41.675
like I am,

21:41.717 --> 21:43.136
you want to do experiments.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.012
So, the challenge is to figure out

21:45.054 --> 21:46.597
how we can explore

21:46.639 --> 21:49.725
more mental states from a scientific perspective.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.938
All that happens in our mental life,

21:53.980 --> 21:57.691
it all comes from the biological activity of the brain.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.569
And the brain is this incredibly complex organ

22:00.611 --> 22:03.447
composed of about 88 billion neurons.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.075
Each neuron has a connection with about

22:06.117 --> 22:08.786
10,000 other neurons.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.831
How do you design experiments

22:11.872 --> 22:13.916
that will help us understand

22:13.958 --> 22:17.211
this relationship between the mind and the body?

22:18.629 --> 22:20.881
You are trying to solve this problem, like,

22:20.923 --> 22:22.758
"How do I design the algorithm?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.136
-Or you know, do one?" -It's creative. Yes.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.679
Yeah, it's really creative.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.473
But, I wake up at night thinking about it.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.017
There's almost nothing else.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.685
You can't go to sleep if you have that.

22:32.726 --> 22:33.727
Exactly.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.688
So you're a nerd too? Yeah!

22:35.729 --> 22:37.648
100 percent.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.110
I think this laboratory

22:41.152 --> 22:43.779
is doing really interesting things.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.824
It's going through very basic questions

22:46.866 --> 22:50.452
about what actually is the definition of consciousness,

22:50.494 --> 22:52.370
of self-awareness.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.581
I never knew that there was somebody

22:54.623 --> 22:56.374
tackling these questions

22:56.416 --> 22:59.212
from a... with a real experimental point.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.005
So this is far more

23:01.047 --> 23:02.923
experimental than I expected.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.925
I said, "Okay, these guys are psychologists.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.803
They're going to talk all the time. That will be it."

23:07.845 --> 23:09.347
That's not the case.

23:09.387 --> 23:12.266
They have... They perform measurements.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.976
They discuss data.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.478
I think we're on the same page with Axel.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.105
I mean, really.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.484
[Axel] So dark matter has mass?

23:22.526 --> 23:25.988
Dark matter must have mass. Yes, must be massive.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.324
So mass you can detect, right?

23:28.366 --> 23:29.867
Yes.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.869
-Yes, yes, yes. -That's all we know it is.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.871
That's how we know it's there.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.039
But...so where is it?

23:35.081 --> 23:36.540
It's going through us.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.125
This is the hypothesis.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.793
-Okay. -So, the...

23:39.835 --> 23:41.921
So this place is full of dark matter?

23:41.962 --> 23:43.881
Yeah, it's like neutrinos in a way.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.092
-Cheers. -Cheers!

23:47.718 --> 23:49.303
We're the only ones drinking.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.411
[Davide] Well, what I'm afraid of, of course,

24:13.451 --> 24:16.496
is that there is no dark matter out there.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.499
-Because it's... -How is that even a possibility?

24:19.541 --> 24:21.335
If there is no dark matter out there,

24:21.377 --> 24:24.338
we need to think really hard

24:24.380 --> 24:26.215
what's the other explanation.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.008
-But... -And your career is over.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.718
No! I mean...

24:29.760 --> 24:32.638
-It's never over. -No, no. It's never over.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.849
-You throw something down... -Of course! That's the thing.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.644
-That's the thing. -When it violates expectations.

24:38.685 --> 24:41.355
Well, that is what makes science really exciting.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.649
Right? Whatever happens happens.

24:43.690 --> 24:46.235
There's always something to think about,

24:46.277 --> 24:48.946
or theorize about, or understand.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.615
So, if there is no dark matter indeed...

24:51.657 --> 24:54.118
You know, that's what it is.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.913
Well, I'm not worried that there's no consciousness.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.957
Right? That's a problem I don't have.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.375
-Yeah. -Right?

25:01.417 --> 25:03.377
I know there is consciousness.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.838
If there's one worry, it's that...

25:05.879 --> 25:07.798
You know, we're not making

25:07.840 --> 25:09.549
sufficiently fast progress

25:09.591 --> 25:11.844
to truly understand how it works.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.096
But what is defining how

25:14.138 --> 25:15.722
fast enough is fast enough?

25:15.764 --> 25:18.267
I don't know. In my lifetime, maybe?

25:18.309 --> 25:19.435
You know?

25:19.477 --> 25:21.312
That's sort of worrying.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.439
I don't know. Sometimes I feel

25:23.481 --> 25:25.607
that we're sort of really far off.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.735
As an individual, you've done that for 10 or 15 years.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.528
You feel, "Okay, We're getting there.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.865
We're getting there!" We're not. You know?

25:33.824 --> 25:35.451
I know exactly what you mean.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.244
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.877
[Axel] Of course, everybody's dream is to make,

25:41.874 --> 25:44.877
as a scientist,

25:44.918 --> 25:46.879
is to make a big discovery, you know?

25:46.920 --> 25:49.882
And to... To truly advance the field.

25:49.923 --> 25:53.719
I don't think it's going to be me. I mean, you know? But...

25:53.760 --> 25:56.389
There's something exciting about, as an individual

25:56.430 --> 25:59.016
feeling connected to these really big issues.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.726
This is what we want to do.

26:00.767 --> 26:04.397
We want to try to solve the hardest problems.

26:04.438 --> 26:07.400
Why would we be here if not to do that?

26:26.919 --> 26:29.505
[man] Is there gonna be a text?

26:29.547 --> 26:32.883
That says "Dr. Luke McKay, Astrobiologist,"

26:32.925 --> 26:34.801
at the bottom of the screen?

26:34.843 --> 26:37.471
[man] Is that what you'd like? What would you have it say?

26:40.307 --> 26:42.351
[Luke] I mean...

26:42.393 --> 26:44.853
What keeps me up at night is...

26:44.895 --> 26:46.439
are we alone?

26:49.567 --> 26:53.195
The microbes that I study in hot springs

26:53.237 --> 26:55.864
clearly defining the boundary conditions

26:55.906 --> 26:57.741
of life on Earth,

26:57.783 --> 26:59.993
is kind of paramount to understanding

27:00.035 --> 27:02.121
where life could be in space.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.295
You know the term shotgun?

27:09.336 --> 27:11.297
No. Well, I know what a shotgun is.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.132
Well, that's from the olden days

27:13.173 --> 27:16.552
when people would ride horse and wagon.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.262
-And you would be out... -There was a guy with a shotgun?

27:18.304 --> 27:20.264
We'd be on the frontier,

27:20.306 --> 27:23.350
and the guy riding shotgun would be ready for the bandits.

27:23.392 --> 27:26.270
-All right. -So you ride next to the driver.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.856
This is how you would get to Burning Man...

27:29.898 --> 27:32.401
I'm told. I've never been.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.779
And now you're too old.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.531
And now I'm too old.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.699
So the Earth's crust sort of is this

27:39.741 --> 27:41.994
crust layer on top of everything,

27:42.035 --> 27:43.787
and then wherever there's kind of a puncture

27:43.829 --> 27:45.539
or a crack, a hole in that...

27:45.581 --> 27:47.625
-You get this. -Is where you get this.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.209
This whole...

27:49.251 --> 27:51.878
This whole region is geo-thermally active.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.256
But you can see in this entire area,

27:54.298 --> 27:56.800
its connection to the subsurface world.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.678
-That sounds spooky. -Yeah.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.723
Connection to the subsurface world.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.686
So this is it? There's fumes coming out of it.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.064
Oh yeah. Look at that!

28:13.400 --> 28:15.569
Just quickly, we'll give you a spiel

28:15.611 --> 28:18.531
about safety around hot springs.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.491
When a lot of people hear the word "hot spring,"

28:20.533 --> 28:21.908
they think of something that you can get in

28:21.950 --> 28:24.161
and have a nice time in.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.663
But, the hot springs that we

28:25.703 --> 28:28.040
typically associate with and study

28:28.081 --> 28:30.125
are way too hot for that.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.169
-And... -And you could go in once.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.213
-But only once. -And you'll never come out.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.964
You won't come out the same.

28:36.006 --> 28:38.217
[Axel] Is there anything to like about this place?

28:38.258 --> 28:40.802
I mean there's snakes, fumes...

28:40.844 --> 28:42.680
danger, temperature...

28:42.721 --> 28:44.598
-That's exactly the question. -That's exactly...

28:44.640 --> 28:46.933
What is there to like about this place?

28:46.975 --> 28:48.852
-We love this place. -Yeah.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.437
-This kind of place. -Yeah.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.649
So the extremophiles are you guys?

28:53.691 --> 28:55.359
Yeah. We both are. Wherever there's something.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.985
We're the extremophile of philes.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.029
So, this is a little bit wet here.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.823
It's getting more wet.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.867
-Are you guys okay? -I'm okay.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.619
All right, let's just do it.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.705
It's going to get wet, a little wetter here.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.718
You just turn that on, I'll drop the end of it in

29:20.759 --> 29:22.802
and let me know what that says.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.600
I'm interested in what the microbial community is here.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.518
So the first thing I want to do is figure out

29:29.560 --> 29:31.520
what's the temperature range and what's the Ph.

29:31.562 --> 29:34.440
-It's hot enough. -Hot enough!

29:34.481 --> 29:37.401
Great. Now, that should slowly climb.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.944
But you let me know when...

29:38.985 --> 29:40.862
-It turns pretty quickly. -...it maxes out.

29:40.904 --> 29:44.866
The temperature is 72.2 Celsius.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.620
We can start collecting.

29:52.625 --> 29:56.169
It's really quiet. You can feel it complaining.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.715
Yeah, so there they are. Our friends.

29:59.757 --> 30:03.719
At this point, I don't know who lives here.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.269
These are sediment samples

30:12.311 --> 30:15.063
taken from the edge of this hot spring.

30:15.105 --> 30:18.108
We'll take these back on dry ice, to the lab

30:18.150 --> 30:21.320
and we'll perform what we call a DNA extraction

30:21.361 --> 30:25.282
to see what sort of novel, unknown

30:25.324 --> 30:27.576
microorganisms might live in this environment.

30:37.377 --> 30:42.633
While I feel strongly that life exists in outer space,

30:42.675 --> 30:45.678
it is technically an unknown.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.682
This is probably what links my work

30:49.723 --> 30:52.184
to Axel's in a way.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.478
What would it be?

30:54.520 --> 30:57.773
What would their equivalent of a brain be?

30:57.815 --> 31:01.819
What would their equivalent of consciousness be?

31:03.821 --> 31:05.614
There you go! Nice.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.324
-All right. Cool. -Nice.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.117
Yeah, okay. Now finish everything else.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.370
Yeah.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.956
Now you just kind of unravel them.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.417
They'll kind of tell you what they want to do.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.301
Do you think the universe is knowable?

31:26.343 --> 31:28.136
I don't know. That's a question...

31:28.178 --> 31:30.013
-for a physicist, I guess. -Yeah.

31:30.055 --> 31:33.058
-Dark matter is a great example. -Yeah.

31:33.099 --> 31:36.562
This very concept that does not interact with light...

31:36.603 --> 31:39.523
We have no way of perceiving it,

31:39.565 --> 31:41.900
that feels really weird to me, you know?

31:41.941 --> 31:45.028
That there's... That there's, I don't know.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.946
Matter around here, maybe? That...

31:46.988 --> 31:48.532
Yeah, yeah.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.367
We have no way of perceiving.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.369
In a way, we sort of forget

31:52.411 --> 31:55.121
that we're always limited by our own senses, right?

32:05.632 --> 32:08.761
Right here... Human beings.

32:08.802 --> 32:11.555
-[Axel] Okay. -Okay. That's a human.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.140
So, if you had to guess

32:14.182 --> 32:18.937
where on this tree of life would be a palm tree,

32:18.978 --> 32:20.814
where would you point?

32:20.856 --> 32:22.775
Well, here. No?

32:22.816 --> 32:24.443
-Right here? -Yeah. Right there.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.985
-A palm tree? -Yeah.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.946
Why? Why would it be there?

32:27.987 --> 32:30.449
Because I didn't draw every branch of the tree of life.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.200
-Okay. Yeah. -Right?

32:32.242 --> 32:35.203
So, there's more than... What is this, 50 branches?

32:35.245 --> 32:37.623
There's more than that many organisms on earth, right?

32:37.664 --> 32:40.375
I'm drawing these major groups, okay?

32:40.417 --> 32:42.294
So if you had a guess

32:42.335 --> 32:45.589
where a fungus would be...

32:45.631 --> 32:48.425
Well...here?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.469
Now you know, now you know.

32:50.510 --> 32:55.014
Yeast would be here, or maybe back here.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.393
Insects, flowers...

32:58.435 --> 33:01.396
When we think of the diversity of life,

33:01.438 --> 33:04.232
we don't think anywhere close

33:04.274 --> 33:06.109
to the total diversity of life.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.236
-This is a domain. -Point well taken.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.572
This is a domain called eukarya.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.491
Okay.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.410
And that's our domain, Eukaryotes.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.871
And then, this... is archaea,

33:20.373 --> 33:22.751
actually...

33:22.793 --> 33:24.419
which is what I'm very interested in.

33:24.461 --> 33:27.213
-Okay. -And this...

33:27.255 --> 33:28.966
is bacteria.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.801
Wow. You know what?

33:30.843 --> 33:34.220
You just, you sort of just drew a brain.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.223
I can't believe it. We're back to brains, you know?

33:37.265 --> 33:38.934
Can you show me where the hippocampus is?

33:38.976 --> 33:40.602
Oh, it would be here.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.729
It would be here in the blue.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.857
But, the point is amazing. You know?

33:44.898 --> 33:46.608
The point you're making about diversity

33:46.650 --> 33:48.067
and how we think about it.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.903
-Yeah, exactly. -And all this unknown bit,

33:49.945 --> 33:52.155
that nobody sees, in fact.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.616
The point that I want to make

33:54.658 --> 33:57.243
is that even microbiologists

33:57.285 --> 34:00.831
know very little about bacteria and archaea.

34:00.873 --> 34:04.042
Historically, our knowledge of microbiology

34:04.083 --> 34:08.046
is based on this sliver of the total diversity of life.

34:08.087 --> 34:10.256
And it wasn't until DNA sequencing

34:10.298 --> 34:12.926
that we started to discover all of this

34:12.968 --> 34:16.680
enormous majority of life that's unknown.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.600
Let me get this started,

34:20.642 --> 34:22.644
then I'm going to let you do the fun part.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.816
Why don't you put two scoops in?

34:27.858 --> 34:30.443
Come here.

34:30.485 --> 34:34.197
There's a very dark, tiny bit that I'm interested in.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.157
-We're going to shake it. -Okay.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.117
Those beads are going to shear the cells,

34:38.159 --> 34:40.245
and that's going to spill the DNA.

34:45.709 --> 34:47.920
And... We put them inside here.

34:47.961 --> 34:50.756
It's a centrifuge, so it spins things very quickly.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.008
But it's an ultra centrifuge.

34:53.050 --> 34:56.636
So it spins things really, really fast.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.726
[Axel] You want to be really sober

34:59.097 --> 35:02.726
when you're looking at this.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.978
-Start to feel a little wobbly? -It's like fireworks. Yeah.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.188
No, no, no. But I mean, it's...

35:07.230 --> 35:09.148
so colorful and so...

35:09.190 --> 35:10.859
literally full of life.

35:10.901 --> 35:13.570
Each of these brightly fluorescing squiggles

35:13.612 --> 35:16.197
is a different type of bacteria,

35:16.239 --> 35:17.866
or maybe the same.

35:17.908 --> 35:20.953
Then, if we change it...

35:20.994 --> 35:23.162
to green, now we're looking at the archaea again,

35:23.204 --> 35:26.374
and you see in the same hot spring,

35:26.416 --> 35:29.711
the same sediments from the banks of a hot spring.

35:29.753 --> 35:32.923
This is many more archaea in that same hot spring.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.466
Yeah, it's a whole universe in a single drop.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.342
Exactly.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.930
And it looks strangely similar to the universe.

35:39.972 --> 35:43.391
Well, you know, I wasn't going to say that, but...

35:43.433 --> 35:45.852
-I'll stop with the analogies. -Exactly.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.395
Yes, it is. It does.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.819
[Luke] It's really cool to have that perspective of

35:53.860 --> 35:56.362
peering down so closely

35:56.404 --> 36:00.533
and focusing on microbial life.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.244
At the same time, you have this

36:03.286 --> 36:05.914
visual connection to outer space.

36:38.279 --> 36:42.200
[woman] I am an observer of forming stars.

36:44.036 --> 36:47.164
I'll be looking at clouds of gas,

36:47.205 --> 36:51.001
trying to understand these mysteries of planet formation.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.755
This is the origin question of how we got here.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.801
-Hey. I'm Luke McKay. -I'm Rachel Smith.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.469
I don't even know what you look like.

37:01.511 --> 37:02.595
I didn't know who you were.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.057
Yeah. Well, here I am.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.683
[Rachel] Hey, look at that!

37:06.725 --> 37:09.227
-Some real cows they brought in. -Real cows.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.687
-They might be robots. -Some Hollywood cows.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.022
You never know, or holograms?

37:12.064 --> 37:13.815
I don't believe it.

37:13.857 --> 37:16.568
Who manages their cows that way?

37:16.609 --> 37:18.111
I love going to the summit.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.238
It's one of my favorite places on Earth.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.991
Scientists all over the world want to get time on these

37:20.279 --> 37:22.991
telescopes.

37:23.033 --> 37:26.870
It's one of the best observing locations in the world.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.249
The altitude can affect people in different ways

37:31.290 --> 37:34.086
-that aren't always predictable. -How high is the summit?

37:34.127 --> 37:36.755
[Rachel] It's about... almost 14,000 feet.

37:37.964 --> 37:40.550
You sure this isn't a motor smell?

37:42.052 --> 37:44.637
-Or gas pedal smell? -I think it's just dust.

37:44.679 --> 37:48.141
-We're really ascending now. -Yeah.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.936
[Luke] Whoa, look how high we are! Oh my God.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.563
-We're like, above everything! -We're above everything.

37:53.605 --> 37:57.192
I feel like a little kid on Christmas.

37:57.234 --> 37:59.111
I feel like myself on Christmas, because I really love Christmas.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.946
That's the altitude, but okay.

38:00.987 --> 38:04.199
The happiness is the lack of oxygen.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.869
Whoa!

38:07.911 --> 38:10.789
[Rachel] You don't appreciate how big they are

38:07.911 --> 38:10.789
until you get here.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.375
Oh, my God.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.086
So cool.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.505
It's back! Yay! Oh, it's our instrument.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.549
-C'mon! Let's get a photo. -Wow.

38:23.927 --> 38:27.388
[Luke chuckles] This is so cool!

38:27.430 --> 38:30.142
The primary mirror is what we're looking at right now.

38:30.183 --> 38:32.644
And you can see our individual segments.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.979
There are 36 segments.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.189
-Right. -Hexagonal in shape.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.066
It makes up that ten meter surface.

38:38.108 --> 38:39.651
The point of the mirrors is to capture

38:39.692 --> 38:41.069
and concentrate the light.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.071
-Yes! -Everything comes in, boom!

38:43.113 --> 38:44.990
-Mirrors send it to an instrument.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.990
-Send it to a single point.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.242
Okay, I got it.

38:47.284 --> 38:48.994
So this is a tool, this giant mirror

38:49.035 --> 38:50.745
with its 36 segments,

38:50.787 --> 38:53.832
on this high location on the planet

38:53.873 --> 38:56.835
to explore towards the center of the galaxy, essentially.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.879
That's the coolest sentence I've ever heard, I think.

38:59.921 --> 39:03.008
We're going to point this at the galactic center.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.592
Yeah! We're going to get light

39:04.634 --> 39:06.219
from this center of the galaxy.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.888
We're going to be looking at some forming stars.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.099
This is like a spaceship, in a way.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.185
But instead of bringing us to space,

39:13.226 --> 39:15.312
it brings space to us.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.319
[Luke] There are very many analogues

39:22.360 --> 39:24.529
between what she's doing and what I'm doing.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.656
And the way she takes a sample

39:26.698 --> 39:28.741
as she's capturing light from these distant places

39:28.783 --> 39:30.952
in the galaxy,

39:30.994 --> 39:34.789
and using different machines, basically,

39:34.831 --> 39:38.459
to look at that light in different ways.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.837
Something about the light can actually tell us

39:40.879 --> 39:43.923
something about the chemistry of that zone

39:43.965 --> 39:45.591
of star formation.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.635
And we're going to stay up all night

39:47.677 --> 39:49.971
'cause night is when all the good stuff happens.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.309
[Rachel] We work hard to get this telescope time.

39:54.351 --> 39:58.188
Writing the proposals... and it's a privilege.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.565
One night we had bad weather, and that was it.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.650
You could come all this way,

40:02.692 --> 40:05.278
and we could have fog, and they close the dome.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.366
[Luke] To be perfectly honest,

40:09.407 --> 40:13.078
I didn't really get the whole thing of not looking into

40:09.407 --> 40:13.078
a telescope.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.872
I didn't understand that the telescope

40:15.914 --> 40:19.042
is way up there, on top of the volcano,

40:19.084 --> 40:22.461
and we're going to be down here in town

40:22.503 --> 40:24.381
looking at computers.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.175
Which in hindsight, makes tons of sense to me.

40:27.217 --> 40:30.387
But I guess when I heard that I'd be doing this,

40:30.428 --> 40:31.804
I was like, "Oh! Sweet!

40:31.846 --> 40:34.099
We're going to be up all night,

40:34.140 --> 40:36.684
peering through the lenses of this telescope."

40:36.726 --> 40:40.897
And that's in fact not at all what's happening.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.733
There's the filter to do the telescope focus.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.902
Okay.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.528
Those webcams look great.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.406
It's going to be a great night.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.450
Layer of relative humidity is quite low.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.119
We're ready to go.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.371
[Luke] Is this a filter wheel?

40:56.413 --> 40:58.831
-It's exactly like a microscope. -Mm-hmm.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.000
A microscope is a little telescope.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.877
-Yeah. -For the tiny things.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.713
It's a telescope for the tiny things.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.970
It's cool. You can see it moving.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.723
-And the stars become lines. -There it is.

41:15.765 --> 41:18.226
That big, bright light is your first star?

41:18.268 --> 41:20.019
[Rachel] And this is showing

41:20.061 --> 41:21.271
how much of the light is coming through.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.981
There's a nice bright star

41:23.022 --> 41:25.150
without a lot of sky.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.026
You know how we saw all that noise in some of the data?

41:27.068 --> 41:28.611
This is really perfect.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.947
Look at it, it's like a painting.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.408
It's like what... we'd love this all night.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.507
[Luke] So, we've been here for...

41:49.548 --> 41:52.927
seven, maybe eight hours?

41:52.969 --> 41:55.180
Wandering through the Milky Way

41:55.221 --> 41:57.974
with the Keck telescope.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.643
Rachel's signature of choice

42:00.685 --> 42:03.021
is carbon monoxide.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.106
And...

42:07.192 --> 42:11.070
that is... that can tell you a lot.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.114
That molecule can tell you a lot

42:13.156 --> 42:16.117
about star formation.

42:16.159 --> 42:18.495
And this is clearly where

42:18.536 --> 42:21.998
my understanding breaks down.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.542
Cue, Rachel.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.339
[Rachel] The cloud of gas around a forming star

42:29.381 --> 42:31.174
is made up of lots of molecules,

42:31.216 --> 42:34.219
one of which is carbon monoxide.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.471
Carbon monoxide is the exhaust

42:36.513 --> 42:38.848
that comes out of your car, and it's toxic.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.641
You don't want to breathe that stuff.

42:40.683 --> 42:42.560
But it's actually a really important molecule

42:42.601 --> 42:45.397
to study in our galaxy.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.483
Carbon is a key element

42:48.525 --> 42:50.318
to understanding how planets form

42:50.360 --> 42:52.111
and understanding

42:52.153 --> 42:54.906
how molecules we need for life are formed.

42:56.366 --> 42:59.536
We don't have that full picture well understood.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.829
The data we get from the telescope

43:01.871 --> 43:03.289
open up a window

43:03.331 --> 43:05.708
into something that might be going on.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.797
How can I, as a small person,

43:11.839 --> 43:15.260
answer a question about the causes?

43:15.301 --> 43:18.513
You have a puzzle with a million or a billion pieces,

43:18.555 --> 43:20.973
and we've got one piece.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.436
Star Log...

43:24.477 --> 43:27.272
Chapter 24, Part three.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.442
The film crew is gone.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.110
It's just us.

43:32.151 --> 43:34.862
I'll do a perspective shot, like this.

43:34.904 --> 43:37.574
-All right, but don't touch it yet.

43:34.904 --> 43:37.574
-I'm not touching anything.

43:39.117 --> 43:43.871
It's almost 5:15 AM, in the morning.

43:43.913 --> 43:46.874
We're getting the last bit of data possible,

43:46.916 --> 43:50.336
before the sun comes and ruins everything.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.977
[Rachel] So, have you ever seen flowing lava before?

44:06.018 --> 44:07.479
[Luke] No.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.148
-Oh, my God! -Oh, my God!

44:10.189 --> 44:12.275
Oh, my God!

44:12.317 --> 44:14.193
This is so cool!

44:15.069 --> 44:17.947
-Oh, my God. -Oh, my God.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.950
[Rachel] It's like the same thing.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.950
We can't go to space,

44:20.992 --> 44:23.786
but we can use telescopes and we can come here.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.913
-It feels like... -It's like bringing space to us.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.665
It's bringing space to us.

44:27.706 --> 44:30.126
And this process makes me feel the same way it felt like

44:30.168 --> 44:32.462
on Mauna Kea at Keck.

44:32.504 --> 44:34.755
In a way, it's like looking at origins

44:34.797 --> 44:37.842
in space, and this is an origin of our planet.

45:08.623 --> 45:11.501
[Rachel] I would love the experience of going to space.

45:13.878 --> 45:17.340
Seeing out a window,

45:17.382 --> 45:20.468
being surrounded by the darkness of space,

45:20.510 --> 45:23.179
really going off into a capsule, kind of looking out,

45:23.221 --> 45:26.516
and just being part of the cosmos that way...

45:55.044 --> 45:58.548
Do you want some water? Do you want some water?

45:58.590 --> 46:00.216
I'll get you some water.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.804
I have coconuts, pina colada.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.057
♪ Pina colada! ♪

46:08.099 --> 46:11.477
Yeah! Want rum?

46:11.519 --> 46:13.688
No, coconut. We're working, right? Yeah.

46:13.730 --> 46:16.357
If he starts licking his balls, you know...

46:16.399 --> 46:19.444
maybe cut it there.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.654
Hi sweetie. Are you a girl?

46:21.696 --> 46:25.199
You might be a girl. Awwww!

46:25.241 --> 46:28.327
From what I understand, we're going to a methane seep.

46:28.369 --> 46:31.706
And it's cold down there, and that's all I know.

46:31.748 --> 46:33.666
I don't know how deep it is.

46:33.708 --> 46:35.752
I was curious and I don't know exactly what they're studying.

46:35.792 --> 46:38.296
But I imagine it's some kind of cool community of creatures.

46:44.885 --> 46:47.221
[woman] There's something very magical about

46:47.263 --> 46:49.682
being down there, looking out the viewport,

46:49.724 --> 46:51.434
seeing things that

46:51.476 --> 46:54.186
maybe no other human has ever seen on the seafloor.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.111
-Rachel, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.

47:02.153 --> 47:05.239
-How was your trip? -It was wonderful.

47:02.153 --> 47:05.239
Really amazing.

47:05.281 --> 47:06.865
-How was your trip out here? -Great. So far, amazing.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.409
-Super amazing. -Great.

47:08.451 --> 47:10.662
How many dives have you been on?

47:10.703 --> 47:12.622
I'd been trying to figure this out the other day.

47:12.664 --> 47:15.874
I think I have... maybe 17 dives?

47:15.916 --> 47:18.795
It's kind of cool. When you're diving tomorrow,

47:18.835 --> 47:20.837
just watch during the descent

47:20.879 --> 47:23.591
and you'll see all these crazy animals.

47:23.633 --> 47:25.426
Can you get pictures of those as you go down?

47:25.468 --> 47:26.885
-I didn't get...yeah. -Oh, you weren't?

47:26.927 --> 47:29.013
We weren't able to get...

47:29.054 --> 47:31.015
Unless you go down too fast to get a picture, right?

47:31.056 --> 47:33.643
Yeah. Usually, you're just so caught up...

47:33.685 --> 47:35.436
In doing the actual work, right?

47:35.478 --> 47:36.688
Yeah.

47:54.955 --> 47:58.042
We could go into the juice bag business.

47:58.083 --> 47:59.918
They remind me of juice boxes.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.630
But no, you wouldn't want to drink this juice.

48:02.672 --> 48:04.507
Well, you know. If you're a microbe...

48:04.549 --> 48:06.592
-Unless you're a microbe. -That's good for now.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.177
We're going to leave a little corner open so we can

48:08.219 --> 48:10.054
-add the chemicals. -Okay.

48:10.095 --> 48:12.223
Science made delicious.

48:13.516 --> 48:15.309
These are all archaea?

48:15.351 --> 48:16.769
They're not all archaea. So, it's...

48:16.811 --> 48:19.104
It's both archaea and bacteria.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.274
We're interested in the organisms that

48:22.316 --> 48:25.528
eat methane and are living in the rocks.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.446
So, people ask me this question a lot

48:27.488 --> 48:29.365
about why I'm doing what I'm doing and stuff, so...

48:29.407 --> 48:32.117
Is there a bigger-picture answer

48:32.159 --> 48:34.662
that understanding the carbon usage

48:34.704 --> 48:36.622
in the microorganisms tells you?

48:36.664 --> 48:40.084
Yeah, well.. So methane is a really

48:40.125 --> 48:42.044
very potent greenhouse gas, right?

48:42.086 --> 48:44.839
We have huge stores of methane

48:44.881 --> 48:48.259
locked up in the deep sea, all along the continental margins.

48:48.300 --> 48:51.220
And most of that methane doesn't get into the atmosphere

48:51.262 --> 48:53.514
because of these microorganisms

48:53.556 --> 48:55.683
that eat it before

48:55.725 --> 48:57.727
it's released into the water column

48:57.769 --> 48:59.936
and up into the atmosphere.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.443
When you dive in Alvin, do you...

49:05.484 --> 49:07.319
And when you dive in Alvin...

49:07.361 --> 49:09.363
-Do I get to dive for sure? -Tomorrow, it's you and me.

49:09.405 --> 49:12.241
Oh, yes! See? Confirmation on film.

49:12.283 --> 49:14.034
-It's you and me tomorrow. -Yes!

49:14.076 --> 49:15.828
-It's on the schedule. -Oh, I'm so excited!

49:15.870 --> 49:17.872
I was saying it's like going to another planet.

49:17.914 --> 49:19.540
Yeah, it is.

49:19.582 --> 49:21.500
It feels like another planet sometimes.

49:21.542 --> 49:23.127
We haven't set up the ping pong table yet,

49:23.168 --> 49:25.003
but that is a high priority for today.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.715
-Is it really? All right. -Yes. Yes.

49:27.757 --> 49:30.593
This is the main lab.

49:39.769 --> 49:41.771
[Rachel] When you're down there, Victoria,

49:41.813 --> 49:44.148
did you ever feel something like, this void?

49:44.189 --> 49:45.524
-Or not so much? -I... No.

49:45.566 --> 49:48.235
I feel totally at calm down there.

49:48.277 --> 49:51.864
Yeah. I would stay, stay down there.

49:51.906 --> 49:53.866
What would you say is the most

49:53.908 --> 49:56.661
amazing thing about diving down?

49:56.702 --> 49:58.496
It's one of the largest habitats,

49:58.537 --> 50:00.122
if you want to call it that,

50:00.164 --> 50:02.291
or environments on our planet.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.962
We've barely begun to scratch the surface.

50:06.002 --> 50:09.340
You said, like it's this... empty barren plane.

50:09.381 --> 50:11.467
But when we see that, we both

50:11.509 --> 50:13.886
see an amazing diversity.

50:13.928 --> 50:16.472
They're tiny and they live in the mud,

50:16.514 --> 50:17.890
and you can't see them.

50:17.932 --> 50:20.184
And most of them are unknown, right?

50:20.225 --> 50:21.936
And haven't been described, but they're there.

50:21.978 --> 50:25.063
It's one of the most diverse places on Earth.

50:32.028 --> 50:34.490
So the other thing you're going to want to do is...

50:34.532 --> 50:37.075
the day you dive, we request that you take a shower

50:37.117 --> 50:38.536
-before you come in the sub. -Okay.

50:38.577 --> 50:39.912
And that you wear clean clothes

50:39.954 --> 50:41.497
as clean as you can possibly stay.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.374
-Is it because of how I look now?

50:41.539 --> 50:43.374
-No, no.

50:43.415 --> 50:44.959
We just always say that.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.053
This is where we're going.

50:57.095 --> 50:59.223
This is everything on the basket.

50:59.264 --> 51:01.433
At the end, when we're running out of batteries,

51:01.475 --> 51:03.143
that's what really defines...

51:03.185 --> 51:05.813
-how long the dive is. -Okay.

51:05.855 --> 51:08.024
As long as nothing else goes wrong.

51:08.064 --> 51:10.026
Right.

51:10.066 --> 51:11.569
Which it won't, because you said many times...

51:11.610 --> 51:13.946
-nothing will go wrong. -Right.

51:13.988 --> 51:15.990
-Yeah. I guarantee it. -You guarantee?

51:16.032 --> 51:18.034
-It's your personal guarantee? -Right?

51:32.464 --> 51:34.425
[buzzer sounds]

51:40.389 --> 51:43.768
So because it's cold in this sub, I brought...

51:43.809 --> 51:46.270
Everything has to be a natural fiber.

51:46.311 --> 51:50.357
Appropriately selected long sleeve shirt.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.444
How are you feeling today as opposed to yesterday,

51:53.485 --> 51:55.111
about the dive?

51:55.153 --> 51:57.406
Just excited about it. Yeah.

51:57.448 --> 51:59.241
Why?

51:59.283 --> 52:01.577
Do I seem nervous about it?

52:01.619 --> 52:03.119
Should I be?

52:04.413 --> 52:07.123
-Bon voyage! -Thank you, thank you.

52:07.165 --> 52:08.208
All right!

52:08.250 --> 52:09.919
[ship's horn sounds]

52:12.004 --> 52:14.214
Oh my gosh!

52:15.674 --> 52:18.052
[man over radio] <i>Copy, we have a match.</i>

52:27.311 --> 52:29.187
<i>Alvin, top lab...</i>

52:29.229 --> 52:32.399
<i>Your launch altitude</i> <i>is 1,000 meters.</i>

52:32.441 --> 52:35.736
<i>By type, you're clear to dive</i> <i>soon as we're cleared.</i>

52:35.778 --> 52:38.154
Copy. 1,000 meters by type,

52:38.196 --> 52:40.365
standing by for swimsuits.

52:42.910 --> 52:45.955
<i>Alvin in one,</i> <i>Swimmers are cleared.</i>

52:45.997 --> 52:48.916
[man 2]<i> Copy. Swimmers</i> <i>are cleared. Alvin diving.</i>

53:05.432 --> 53:08.144
Oh, wow! It's green.

53:08.184 --> 53:10.437
Yeah, it's really green.

53:10.479 --> 53:11.981
Is this the light?

53:12.023 --> 53:14.733
No, we're in the middle of a big plankton bloom.

53:34.252 --> 53:36.254
Am I seeing the bottom?

53:42.178 --> 53:45.014
This is the coolest capsule. It is like being in space.

53:45.056 --> 53:48.350
It feels more spacious, the more time we spend in it.

53:48.392 --> 53:50.352
We have enough peanut butter sandwiches

53:50.394 --> 53:54.356
to last at least another 30 minutes...

53:54.398 --> 53:56.400
the rate we're eating.

53:58.652 --> 54:01.405
Oh my! Oh, look at these mussel beds!

54:01.446 --> 54:03.782
Wow! This is nice.

54:10.206 --> 54:11.707
When they turn the lights on,

54:11.749 --> 54:14.085
you see these bright red shrimp.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.003
Which is striking, considering

54:16.045 --> 54:17.755
the muted colors otherwise.

54:17.796 --> 54:20.632
There's kind of a drabby color environment.

54:22.634 --> 54:24.386
Everything just seems slower

54:24.428 --> 54:26.346
'cause you're at such high pressure.

54:29.808 --> 54:31.560
The connection between

54:31.602 --> 54:33.229
the seeps and global warming is really interesting.

54:33.269 --> 54:35.022
I hadn't thought much about that

54:35.064 --> 54:37.900
until talking to Victoria and Erik about it.

54:39.068 --> 54:41.528
[Victoria] Methane is a greenhouse gas

54:41.570 --> 54:43.864
much more powerful than carbon dioxide,

54:43.906 --> 54:45.449
in terms of its potential

54:45.490 --> 54:47.534
to warm the planet.

54:49.745 --> 54:53.040
And it turns out these microorganisms that we study

54:53.082 --> 54:55.333
are using this gas

54:55.375 --> 54:57.461
to support their life,

54:57.502 --> 55:00.131
and also support other animals

55:00.172 --> 55:02.091
that are found in that environment.

55:05.261 --> 55:06.637
[Rachel] You get to the methane seep,

55:06.678 --> 55:08.430
you see these really cool creatures.

55:08.472 --> 55:12.226
You see the yeti crabs eat the bacteria.

55:12.268 --> 55:14.603
The base of this food chain is

55:14.645 --> 55:17.355
the bacteria and the methane.

55:17.397 --> 55:19.900
[Victoria] Even though they're very small in size

55:19.942 --> 55:22.069
and we can't see them with our naked eyes,

55:22.111 --> 55:24.905
these microorganisms that we study

55:24.947 --> 55:27.616
are basically the methane gatekeepers.

55:34.081 --> 55:37.168
Hi, Rachel. This is Victoria. We were curious

55:37.209 --> 55:40.796
how your experience has been so far.

55:40.838 --> 55:43.299
<i>I've been taking video</i> <i>of what's out my window.</i>

55:43.339 --> 55:44.842
<i>And they've been</i> <i>getting samples,</i>

55:44.883 --> 55:46.426
<i>Erik and Mike have been</i> <i>getting samples.</i>

55:46.468 --> 55:47.886
<i>It's been really,</i> <i>really interesting.</i>

55:47.928 --> 55:49.429
<i>It's awesome down here.</i>

55:49.471 --> 55:51.223
Well, bring back good samples.

55:51.265 --> 55:53.267
Give my best to Erik.

55:55.936 --> 55:58.689
[Erik] We're taking rocks that are right in the middle

55:58.730 --> 56:00.440
of this flow of gas,

56:00.482 --> 56:04.402
and we're moving them different distances away to see

56:04.444 --> 56:06.322
if they change, depending on

56:06.362 --> 56:09.074
how far away from the seep they are.

56:10.701 --> 56:12.619
We're trying to learn how

56:12.661 --> 56:14.705
this methane input

56:14.746 --> 56:16.999
affects the entire ocean.

56:22.213 --> 56:25.507
[Rachel] When you move past the methane seep,

56:25.549 --> 56:28.635
the amount of life kind of vanishes pretty quickly.

56:28.677 --> 56:31.513
You end up being in this void...

56:31.555 --> 56:33.515
relatively fast.

56:34.850 --> 56:38.145
I really like looking out and seeing nothing.

56:44.860 --> 56:47.112
It's like being in a spaceship.

57:07.216 --> 57:08.633
Welcome back.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.177
You know, I sympathize with astronauts

57:10.219 --> 57:12.096
who haven't walked on firm ground.

57:12.137 --> 57:13.722
We were only there for six hours.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.933
What was your favorite part?

57:15.974 --> 57:18.810
I liked being inside the orb.

57:18.852 --> 57:22.022
Like, you just imagine we're in a metal sphere in the ocean.

57:22.064 --> 57:25.276
It's kind of a little trippy inside,

57:22.064 --> 57:25.276
with all the red buttons.

57:25.317 --> 57:28.195
We could be anywhere in the universe.

57:30.488 --> 57:32.699
[Victoria] I really love looking at the samples

57:32.741 --> 57:34.410
when they come up the seashore.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.913
Kind of like every Alvin dive is Christmas morning.

57:37.955 --> 57:39.456
You know? The samples come up,

57:39.497 --> 57:42.167
and we get to go and look

57:42.209 --> 57:43.668
at what people collected.

57:45.963 --> 57:49.007
My hope is that eventually, one day

57:49.049 --> 57:50.801
we'll be able to really understand

57:50.842 --> 57:52.552
how microbial ecosystems tick.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.554
I don't think this is

57:54.596 --> 57:57.141
even a ten-year achievable goal.

57:58.350 --> 58:00.852
It's been almost like this,

58:00.894 --> 58:03.063
this long-term obsession.

58:03.105 --> 58:04.856
The projects that I work on

58:04.898 --> 58:06.984
are a multi-year investment.

58:08.235 --> 58:09.569
Maybe many people

58:09.611 --> 58:11.238
who aren't in the sciences...

58:11.280 --> 58:13.407
A lot of times, you just see a finished product

58:13.449 --> 58:16.243
of a nice publication.

58:16.285 --> 58:18.662
And we rarely write in the publication,

58:18.703 --> 58:20.789
"We spent three years doing

58:20.831 --> 58:23.208
all of these other things before this finally worked."

58:51.820 --> 58:53.571
-[man] Hi. -Hello, Jun!

58:53.613 --> 58:55.824
-Victoria. Welcome to Boulder. -Very nice to meet you.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.617
-Thank you. -Very nice meeting you.

58:57.659 --> 59:00.537
So you live in California? You're based in California?

59:00.578 --> 59:01.997
Yeah, I'm at Cal Tech.

59:02.039 --> 59:03.707
-Cal Tech? -In Pasadena, yes.

59:03.748 --> 59:05.292
Oh, I didn't know!

59:05.334 --> 59:07.044
You didn't tell me they're from Cal Tech.

59:09.296 --> 59:11.173
[Jun] As we know, time and space

59:11.215 --> 59:13.175
is fundamentally connected.

59:16.387 --> 59:18.555
We are really exploring the frontiers

59:18.596 --> 59:21.725
of quantum physics and quantum technology.

59:26.522 --> 59:28.940
Have you watched the movie called<i> Interstellar?</i>

59:28.982 --> 59:31.485
-I haven't seen<i> Interstellar.</i> -It was a great movie.

59:31.527 --> 59:34.821
These astronauts went in near the black hole.

59:34.863 --> 59:36.490
When he came back,

59:36.532 --> 59:37.908
the daughter was much older than him.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.410
Yeah.

59:39.451 --> 59:40.994
You'll see some of that in our lab tomorrow.

59:41.036 --> 59:42.454
-Great! -It's not science fiction.

59:42.496 --> 59:45.249
You'll actually see clocks slow down

59:45.290 --> 59:48.168
as you get closer to the center of the earth.

59:48.210 --> 59:49.669
No kidding?

59:49.711 --> 59:51.713
So, that's...

59:51.755 --> 59:53.590
It's the relativity effect that Einstein

59:53.631 --> 59:55.592
postulated a hundred years ago.

59:55.633 --> 59:57.428
It's called general relativity,

59:57.469 --> 59:59.471
that time is all relative,

59:59.513 --> 1:00:02.224
and when you have heavy mass,

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:04.435
it's going to warp the space-time around you.

1:00:04.476 --> 1:00:06.311
-Yeah. -And time is going

1:00:04.476 --> 1:00:06.311
to be different.

1:00:06.353 --> 1:00:08.688
And we can test that. If you raise your watch

1:00:08.730 --> 1:00:14.778
by a couple of centimeters, the time speeds up...

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:16.696
at a very small level. Only modern atomic clocks

1:00:16.738 --> 1:00:18.615
now can detect those.

1:00:18.656 --> 1:00:21.368
Okay, so you're saying if you move your watch a few...

1:00:21.410 --> 1:00:23.912
centimeters distance...

1:00:23.954 --> 1:00:26.206
-You can tell the difference. Yeah.

1:00:23.954 --> 1:00:26.206
-You detect change?

1:00:26.248 --> 1:00:28.250
And at what level... Like, how many...

1:00:28.292 --> 1:00:30.294
How many decimal points

1:00:30.335 --> 1:00:31.503
do we need to go out?

1:00:31.545 --> 1:00:33.213
-It's 10 to the 18th. -Okay.

1:00:33.255 --> 1:00:35.006
Yeah.

1:00:35.048 --> 1:00:38.093
The clock is already a quantum sensor.

1:00:38.135 --> 1:00:40.512
I actually like to call it a sensor.

1:00:40.554 --> 1:00:43.140
It's something we use to measure.

1:00:48.479 --> 1:00:51.773
Thanks everybody for showing up.

1:00:51.815 --> 1:00:54.067
I would like to introduce you to Victoria.

1:00:54.109 --> 1:00:56.736
She's a professor at Cal Tech.

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:58.614
The thing that impressed me most is that she dived down

1:00:58.655 --> 1:01:00.740
5,000 meters to the bottom of the ocean

1:01:00.782 --> 1:01:02.909
and studied ecosystems.

1:01:02.951 --> 1:01:05.203
I'm part of the Geological and Planetary Science

1:01:05.245 --> 1:01:06.788
division at Cal Tech.

1:01:06.830 --> 1:01:08.582
But, today... I think we

1:01:08.624 --> 1:01:11.960
I think we want to give her a treat.

1:01:12.002 --> 1:01:14.338
To kind of participate in a group discussion

1:01:14.379 --> 1:01:16.256
that's very technical on the physics side of

1:01:16.298 --> 1:01:18.800
making clocks and understanding strontium atoms.

1:01:18.842 --> 1:01:21.595
Go easy with the descriptions.

1:01:21.637 --> 1:01:23.680
When things get really, really cold,

1:01:23.721 --> 1:01:25.557
The quantum mechanics mayor

1:01:25.599 --> 1:01:27.267
the fact that an atom is on a particle.

1:01:27.309 --> 1:01:29.436
But a wave begins to matter.

1:01:29.478 --> 1:01:31.688
We want a very particular frequency.

1:01:31.729 --> 1:01:33.815
We want that to be as precise as possible.

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:36.443
For this upcoming clock comparison, we're going to

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:36.443
compare

1:01:36.485 --> 1:01:37.861
one of these strontium optical lattice blocks

1:01:37.902 --> 1:01:39.488
to the terbium optical lattice blocks.

1:01:39.530 --> 1:01:42.157
This is a boring image, and that's good.

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:44.951
We want these images to be as boring as possible.

1:01:44.993 --> 1:01:47.162
So hundreds of terahertz as opposed to

1:01:47.204 --> 1:01:48.580
tens of gigahertz frequencies.

1:01:48.622 --> 1:01:50.207
Just to make sure I understand...

1:01:50.248 --> 1:01:53.502
So you have your ground state,

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:56.796
then you shine... light at a certain frequency,

1:01:56.838 --> 1:01:58.173
and then you look at it again?

1:01:58.215 --> 1:02:00.008
-Yes. -And then, you're seeing,

1:02:00.050 --> 1:02:02.594
how many of those atoms then are at the excited state

1:02:02.636 --> 1:02:04.555
and what's their spatial distribution?

1:02:04.596 --> 1:02:07.015
Isn't that amazing? Isn't it amazing?

1:02:07.057 --> 1:02:09.601
She totally understood the clock measurements.

1:02:14.105 --> 1:02:16.400
Welcome to our lab.

1:02:16.441 --> 1:02:18.776
It'll be different from the ocean field.

1:02:18.818 --> 1:02:20.362
Yeah. Yeah.

1:02:20.404 --> 1:02:22.947
So, it will look a bit random

1:02:22.989 --> 1:02:24.449
with lots of ancient things.

1:02:24.491 --> 1:02:26.451
But believe me, all the cables there...

1:02:26.493 --> 1:02:28.870
There is a purpose for all these cables.

1:02:31.873 --> 1:02:34.167
I'll take you right into

1:02:34.209 --> 1:02:36.878
this particular system right here.

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:40.131
If you look just to the right side of this lens,

1:02:40.173 --> 1:02:42.467
into the vacuum chamber,

1:02:42.509 --> 1:02:44.386
do you see that little ball of blue light?

1:02:44.428 --> 1:02:47.180
-Yes! -These are 10 million atoms

1:02:47.222 --> 1:02:49.974
of strontium fluorescing under this light.

1:02:50.016 --> 1:02:52.227
And you can see, it's stationary.

1:02:52.269 --> 1:02:53.645
There's nothing else in there.

1:02:53.687 --> 1:02:55.939
It's a vacuum chamber and a light.

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:59.025
Those atoms provide this swing

1:02:59.067 --> 1:03:01.361
of the pendulum when you open a grandfather clock,

1:03:01.403 --> 1:03:03.363
that's the first thing you see,

1:03:03.405 --> 1:03:05.532
that there's something swinging back and forth, a pendulum.

1:03:05.574 --> 1:03:07.033
That's your pendulum right there.

1:03:07.075 --> 1:03:08.952
The blue ball, which is oscillating

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:11.788
at about a million billion cycles per second.

1:03:16.668 --> 1:03:18.545
This is actually the world's

1:03:18.587 --> 1:03:21.423
most accurate atomic clock that's ever built.

1:03:21.465 --> 1:03:24.509
It's called a strontium optical lattice clock.

1:03:24.551 --> 1:03:27.471
What it means, over the entire age of the universe,

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:30.432
it would lose less than one second of the time.

1:03:30.474 --> 1:03:32.225
The fact that we have this open right now

1:03:32.267 --> 1:03:34.311
and we are filming it...

1:03:34.352 --> 1:03:36.020
The clock won't work very well right now

1:03:36.062 --> 1:03:37.522
because we are all here.

1:03:37.564 --> 1:03:39.274
We are warm bodies.

1:03:39.316 --> 1:03:41.610
We have a lot of temperature gradient.

1:03:41.652 --> 1:03:43.487
It's probably changing these mirrors by

1:03:43.528 --> 1:03:45.822
just such a small, tiny amount

1:03:45.863 --> 1:03:48.241
that can cause a little bit of a misalignment.

1:03:51.286 --> 1:03:53.830
[Victoria] The fact that they can control atoms

1:03:53.871 --> 1:03:56.166
under super-cooled conditions, but we're looking at it

1:03:56.207 --> 1:03:58.168
like it's just hanging like a magic ball

1:03:58.209 --> 1:04:01.254
of light, it's wild.

1:04:05.300 --> 1:04:08.804
So Chris and I are academic brothers.

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:11.431
Yes, we've known each other for

1:04:11.473 --> 1:04:13.433
more than 20... about 25 years, I guess.

1:04:20.816 --> 1:04:22.359
So this laboratory has one of our

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.528
optical atomic clocks in it.

1:04:24.569 --> 1:04:26.613
Atomic clocks play, actually, a very important role,

1:04:26.655 --> 1:04:28.699
even in driving your car in the sense that

1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:31.451
the whole GPS constellation is full of atomic clocks.

1:04:31.493 --> 1:04:33.286
How many people hit...

1:04:33.328 --> 1:04:36.206
and just use a data server

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:38.249
to synchronize their clock?

1:04:38.291 --> 1:04:40.627
We get something like 20 billion hits a day.

1:04:40.669 --> 1:04:42.796
-20 billion? -Billion! Which is...

1:04:42.838 --> 1:04:45.256
I mean, Google, I think, gets something like 7 billion hits.

1:04:45.298 --> 1:04:47.258
Now granted, Google's requests are a little more complicated

1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:49.052
than "What time is it?"

1:04:49.093 --> 1:04:51.805
Computers all around the world are constantly hitting

1:04:51.847 --> 1:04:54.015
this to re-clock, asking for what time it is.

1:04:55.975 --> 1:04:57.935
So what we have here is

1:04:57.977 --> 1:04:59.396
the calcium thermal beam clock.

1:04:59.437 --> 1:05:01.565
By far the best part is when the light

1:05:01.606 --> 1:05:04.317
is hitting the atoms, and the atoms are telling you stuff.

1:05:04.359 --> 1:05:06.444
-Communicating. -This process just...

1:05:06.486 --> 1:05:07.738
It really is infectious.

1:05:07.779 --> 1:05:09.489
You can tell Chris is very passionate.

1:05:09.531 --> 1:05:12.325
He's talking about atoms and humanizing them.

1:05:12.367 --> 1:05:15.328
He's talking about he and she, and she is communicating back.

1:05:15.370 --> 1:05:18.331
Once you get into this very intimate game of

1:05:18.373 --> 1:05:20.667
getting information, you do feel like you're talking to something

1:05:20.709 --> 1:05:23.086
almost intelligent, but... But, it's...

1:05:23.127 --> 1:05:25.255
It's just something you can't help because you get

1:05:25.296 --> 1:05:27.841
such an intimate working relationship with them.

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:31.177
Some people say, what do you need

1:05:31.219 --> 1:05:33.388
another digit on your atomic clock for?

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:35.599
I get asked that question all the time.

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:38.268
And the answer is that time, sort of paradoxically,

1:05:38.309 --> 1:05:40.771
is a quantity that we don't understand

1:05:40.812 --> 1:05:42.689
philosophically very well at all. I mean...

1:05:42.731 --> 1:05:45.692
no one really has a great sense of what time really is.

1:05:45.734 --> 1:05:47.402
But we can measure it,

1:05:47.444 --> 1:05:49.279
5,6,7 orders of magnitude better

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:51.072
than any other physical quantity.

1:05:51.114 --> 1:05:53.700
We have not really seen any fundamental limits

1:05:53.742 --> 1:05:56.578
-to...to clocks. -What you can't do yet, yeah.

1:05:56.620 --> 1:05:58.455
-Right, exactly. -You can't just say, "Oh!

1:05:58.496 --> 1:05:59.915
We'll never get better than that."

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:01.499
We haven't really seen that.

1:06:16.681 --> 1:06:18.516
[Jun] To build the very best clock,

1:06:18.558 --> 1:06:20.685
if you say, I raise my clock

1:06:20.727 --> 1:06:22.729
from the ground up,

1:06:22.771 --> 1:06:25.273
and the time speeds up a little bit.

1:06:25.315 --> 1:06:27.191
As you move towards the mountain,

1:06:27.233 --> 1:06:29.402
time will slow down.

1:06:29.444 --> 1:06:31.112
[Victoria] Just like going to the center of the earth.

1:06:31.154 --> 1:06:32.697
You're moving towards a bigger mass.

1:06:32.739 --> 1:06:34.783
Exactly! It's the big mass that matters.

1:06:34.825 --> 1:06:37.619
Could you by following how much time

1:06:37.661 --> 1:06:39.871
slows back out the mass?

1:06:39.913 --> 1:06:41.957
-That it's? -Yes.

1:06:41.998 --> 1:06:45.126
Say we place a clock around Yellowstone National Park,

1:06:45.168 --> 1:06:47.754
and see whether there will be a danger,

1:06:47.796 --> 1:06:50.465
where there's too much mass starting to amass underneath.

1:06:50.507 --> 1:06:52.049
Eventually, it's going to erupt.

1:06:52.091 --> 1:06:54.928
It would be great to have that warning.

1:06:54.970 --> 1:06:56.972
The clock will tell you that.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:08.441
Measurement really is at the heart of modern science.

1:07:08.483 --> 1:07:12.612
Everything is based on measurement.

1:07:12.654 --> 1:07:15.866
There's still certainly many mysteries out there.

1:07:15.907 --> 1:07:17.951
Science has always gone this way...

1:07:17.993 --> 1:07:20.495
You use what you have understood.

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:22.789
You build better instrumentation and you go out there.

1:07:22.831 --> 1:07:25.166
You measure, you find things

1:07:25.208 --> 1:07:27.711
which is different from what you predict.

1:07:27.752 --> 1:07:29.838
You have heard the terms of

1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.840
dark matter, dark energy.

1:07:31.882 --> 1:07:33.633
There's something beyond.

1:07:33.675 --> 1:07:36.135
We don't know yet what that is.

1:07:36.177 --> 1:07:38.013
There are explosions happening when the black holes merge.

1:07:39.931 --> 1:07:41.641
There's gravitational waves being emitted

1:07:41.683 --> 1:07:43.267
throughout the universe.

1:07:43.309 --> 1:07:44.811
Maybe we can even hear the echo

1:07:44.853 --> 1:07:47.271
of the Big Bang

1:07:47.313 --> 1:07:49.816
coming back from the edge of the universe.

1:07:51.234 --> 1:07:54.153
As you build the clock to the 19s, 20s digits,

1:07:54.195 --> 1:07:56.614
what are we going to see?

1:08:22.933 --> 1:08:25.769
[man] I guess I was always interested in the brain.

1:08:27.353 --> 1:08:30.607
It still, at the end of the day, might prove to be

1:08:30.648 --> 1:08:34.235
this mystery that we can't understand.

1:08:38.448 --> 1:08:41.910
-Hi. Jun. Nice to meet you. -Anil Seth. Very nice

1:08:38.448 --> 1:08:41.910
to meet you.

1:08:41.952 --> 1:08:43.620
Thank you for coming to meet both of us.

1:08:43.661 --> 1:08:46.163
Welcome to the beautiful Sussex countryside.

1:08:46.205 --> 1:08:47.999
This is incredible. I've never been here.

1:08:48.041 --> 1:08:49.876
The ocean's right here. Anil, what do you do?

1:08:49.918 --> 1:08:52.211
I'm a neuroscientist.

1:08:52.253 --> 1:08:54.338
Actually, my background is quite varied.

1:08:54.380 --> 1:08:56.257
I was trained in physics, actually.

1:08:56.299 --> 1:08:58.301
-To begin with, or I started. -I'm a physicist.

1:08:58.342 --> 1:09:00.720
That's what I've been told. Looking forward to...

1:09:00.762 --> 1:09:03.264
I'm just learning about you right now, as we speak.

1:09:03.306 --> 1:09:04.933
I'm a physicist. I build instrumentations.

1:09:04.975 --> 1:09:07.435
That's why I'm curious about

1:09:07.477 --> 1:09:09.813
how you interface with the brain.

1:09:09.854 --> 1:09:12.816
I think what's frustrating is

1:09:12.857 --> 1:09:15.485
we recognize how poorly we're able to measure things.

1:09:15.526 --> 1:09:18.404
There's always this analogy

1:09:18.446 --> 1:09:20.406
that the current brain imaging methods that we have,

1:09:20.448 --> 1:09:24.119
it's a little bit like having a microphone like this,

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.537
500 kilometers in the sky, and you're trying to listen

1:09:26.579 --> 1:09:28.456
to a whole bunch of people shouting

1:09:28.498 --> 1:09:30.083
different things in a field below.

1:09:30.125 --> 1:09:32.127
We may still just lack

1:09:32.168 --> 1:09:34.211
the sufficient technology, yeah.

1:09:34.253 --> 1:09:37.298
-And it's... -You hit a resonance there

1:09:37.340 --> 1:09:39.717
when you said it's all about measurement in science.

1:09:39.759 --> 1:09:42.386
I have colleagues who build magnetometers,

1:09:42.428 --> 1:09:44.263
which can be implemented.

1:09:44.305 --> 1:09:47.100
-Oh really? -Around brains to

1:09:44.305 --> 1:09:47.100
do brain imaging.

1:09:47.142 --> 1:09:48.852
So, we develop instrumentation

1:09:48.893 --> 1:09:50.812
that hopefully can be useful for you guys.

1:09:50.854 --> 1:09:52.939
Excellent! Bring any with you?

1:09:52.981 --> 1:09:55.191
No, I didn't.

1:09:58.486 --> 1:10:00.321
That's the other important part...

1:10:00.363 --> 1:10:03.240
-Welcome to the UK, of course. -Thank you very much, yeah.

1:10:03.282 --> 1:10:04.826
See some countryside, have a drink.

1:10:07.162 --> 1:10:08.705
And a...

1:10:08.746 --> 1:10:10.623
-Do you just want... -Just a glass of water.

1:10:10.665 --> 1:10:12.208
Yeah, thank you.

1:10:12.249 --> 1:10:15.753
I'm interested about our experience

1:10:15.795 --> 1:10:17.839
of what you might call psychological time.

1:10:17.881 --> 1:10:20.257
-Speeding up as we get older. -It can be very subjective.

1:10:20.299 --> 1:10:22.301
Part of the puzzle is that

1:10:22.343 --> 1:10:24.888
we don't have time detectors

1:10:24.929 --> 1:10:27.015
in in our brains.

1:10:27.057 --> 1:10:28.933
I think it's one of the longstanding...

1:10:28.975 --> 1:10:30.351
challenges

1:10:30.393 --> 1:10:32.228
is to figure out

1:10:32.269 --> 1:10:34.898
how the brain constructs the experience of time

1:10:34.939 --> 1:10:37.358
given that it's got no time sensors.

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.903
What's it based on?

1:10:39.944 --> 1:10:42.697
I'll be very interested to see what you think of this.

1:10:42.739 --> 1:10:44.824
-And this is... -Warrick Roseboom.

1:10:44.866 --> 1:10:46.826
Hi, I'm Jun. Nice to meet you.

1:10:46.868 --> 1:10:48.619
He really knows much more about time than I do.

1:10:48.661 --> 1:10:50.830
This will be the first time

1:10:50.872 --> 1:10:52.916
we've run a person as subject

1:10:52.957 --> 1:10:55.793
on this particular experiment.

1:10:55.835 --> 1:10:57.795
What's going to happen is he's going to watch this video.

1:10:57.837 --> 1:11:00.715
That will go for some duration.

1:11:00.757 --> 1:11:03.218
If you look through the, through the magnet ball.

1:11:03.259 --> 1:11:05.929
-Yes. -At the back, there's a screen.

1:11:05.970 --> 1:11:08.514
It's showing the same thing you see here.

1:11:08.556 --> 1:11:10.516
And then after that video finishes, this will come up.

1:11:10.558 --> 1:11:12.977
You just move the joystick

1:11:13.019 --> 1:11:15.438
until the number on the scale represents

1:11:15.479 --> 1:11:17.815
-how long you felt it went for. -Okay.

1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:27.742
[Anil] We are going to be recording

1:11:27.784 --> 1:11:30.578
what his brain is doing.

1:11:30.620 --> 1:11:32.413
The reason we're doing this is...

1:11:32.455 --> 1:11:34.331
It's obviously nice to see inside somebody's brain

1:11:34.373 --> 1:11:36.542
but we are trying to see

1:11:36.584 --> 1:11:39.003
how well our model of time perception

1:11:39.045 --> 1:11:41.965
matches to what Jun's brain is doing.

1:11:42.006 --> 1:11:44.592
[machine beeping]

1:11:45.426 --> 1:11:47.553
Quite loud.

1:11:47.595 --> 1:11:50.265
Is that okay if we start the experiment now, Jun?

1:11:50.306 --> 1:11:52.058
-Are you ready? -Yes, I'm ready.

1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:54.185
Okay.

1:11:54.227 --> 1:11:56.980
So now, we're waiting for the first video to come up.

1:11:59.482 --> 1:12:02.110
Pretty stable scene. There's not much going on.

1:12:02.152 --> 1:12:04.028
This is one of our office spaces

1:12:04.070 --> 1:12:05.905
in the other building.

1:12:05.947 --> 1:12:07.490
It's just lots of people thinking very hard,

1:12:07.531 --> 1:12:09.200
not much actual visual stuff happening.

1:12:09.242 --> 1:12:11.619
Good, you can see he's making a response.

1:12:11.661 --> 1:12:14.247
Let's see how long he thought that was.

1:12:32.515 --> 1:12:33.766
How well did you think you did?

1:12:33.808 --> 1:12:35.893
I felt...

1:12:35.935 --> 1:12:39.981
I felt I was doing well.

1:12:40.023 --> 1:12:42.441
We think you may not have done quite so well.

1:12:42.483 --> 1:12:43.985
Okay, that's good. Yeah.

1:12:44.027 --> 1:12:45.695
The first few videos, it seemed that...

1:12:45.736 --> 1:12:47.155
-I was way off? -You were.

1:12:47.197 --> 1:12:49.365
It looked like you were overestimating.

1:12:49.406 --> 1:12:51.450
-Okay. -Quite, quite a lot.

1:12:51.492 --> 1:12:53.410
Which is interesting, for somebody who's built

1:12:53.452 --> 1:12:56.331
the world's most accurate clock.

1:12:56.372 --> 1:12:57.540
That is my brain, huh?

1:12:57.581 --> 1:12:59.625
That. That's your brain.

1:12:59.667 --> 1:13:02.461
Do you recognize any bits of your brain there?

1:13:02.503 --> 1:13:04.380
I don't.

1:13:04.421 --> 1:13:06.966
This is my first time looking at my brain.

1:13:07.008 --> 1:13:10.970
-I've never done this scan before.

1:13:07.008 --> 1:13:10.970
-Okay.

1:13:11.012 --> 1:13:14.390
[Anil] We don't have time sensors in the brain.

1:13:14.431 --> 1:13:17.476
Time has to be a construction.

1:13:18.895 --> 1:13:21.105
One idea is that our experience

1:13:21.147 --> 1:13:23.733
of time comes about through

1:13:23.774 --> 1:13:26.361
how things change in our visual perception.

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:29.155
There's lots of change, and maybe

1:13:29.197 --> 1:13:32.158
our durations will seem longer.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:33.910
If nothing changes,

1:13:33.951 --> 1:13:36.537
our experience of time will be really impoverished.

1:13:36.579 --> 1:13:40.875
We're trying to close the loop and come up with

1:13:40.917 --> 1:13:43.586
a unified explanation of human time perception.

1:13:46.214 --> 1:13:48.632
But it goes deeper than that.

1:13:51.010 --> 1:13:52.720
If you want to understand

1:13:52.762 --> 1:13:55.932
the relationship between brains and consciousness,

1:13:55.973 --> 1:13:58.475
in my lab we've got mathematicians

1:13:58.517 --> 1:14:01.520
and physicists and virtual reality engineers.

1:14:01.562 --> 1:14:04.774
[Jun] Oh, now it looks very strange!

1:14:04.815 --> 1:14:07.735
For a second, this didn't turn into animals.

1:14:07.777 --> 1:14:10.113
I've never seen things like that before.

1:14:11.239 --> 1:14:13.616
[Anil] One of the things that I've

1:14:13.657 --> 1:14:15.243
really tried to cultivate

1:14:15.285 --> 1:14:17.370
is a very interdisciplinary approach

1:14:17.412 --> 1:14:19.622
to get at this problem, this basic problem,

1:14:19.663 --> 1:14:21.540
of how consciousness happens.

1:14:30.716 --> 1:14:33.219
What a beautiful place.

1:14:34.553 --> 1:14:36.306
There's this perspective,

1:14:36.347 --> 1:14:38.349
I think it's a pretty poor argument,

1:14:38.391 --> 1:14:40.017
but it's called Mysterianism.

1:14:40.059 --> 1:14:41.560
So there's the idea that

1:14:41.602 --> 1:14:44.021
even if we have arbitrarily fast computers

1:14:44.063 --> 1:14:45.648
and all the technology that we want,

1:14:45.689 --> 1:14:47.691
there will still be some things

1:14:47.733 --> 1:14:50.611
that will forever defy our understanding,

1:14:50.653 --> 1:14:51.946
because we humans are

1:14:51.988 --> 1:14:54.324
cognitively limited in some way.

1:14:54.365 --> 1:14:57.118
However much we magnify our cognitive abilities

1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:00.288
through technology, there must be things

1:15:00.330 --> 1:15:02.206
that we cannot understand

1:15:02.248 --> 1:15:04.083
however much help we have.

1:15:04.125 --> 1:15:05.835
In the same way that if you're a frog,

1:15:05.876 --> 1:15:07.795
however much help you give the frog,

1:15:07.837 --> 1:15:10.256
it's not going to understand quantum mechanics.

1:15:10.298 --> 1:15:11.841
It's still a frog.

1:15:11.882 --> 1:15:13.801
So there might be an equivalent for us.

1:15:13.843 --> 1:15:16.346
On the other hand, the history of science

1:15:16.387 --> 1:15:18.264
has been quite astounding.

1:15:18.306 --> 1:15:20.391
There have been things that people would've thought

1:15:20.433 --> 1:15:21.684
completely beyond our understanding.

1:15:21.725 --> 1:15:23.769
We can and we have.

1:15:27.357 --> 1:15:29.692
[Jun] Though I have only known Anil for two days,

1:15:29.733 --> 1:15:32.778
I feel he's a... a true scientist.

1:15:32.820 --> 1:15:35.448
It's really appealing to me that

1:15:35.490 --> 1:15:37.158
we can speak from, coming from

1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:38.993
very different scientific disciplines.

1:15:39.035 --> 1:15:40.744
And yet, we speak a common language.

1:15:40.786 --> 1:15:42.830
It's been a really pleasure to spend time with Jun.

1:15:42.872 --> 1:15:45.624
He's a... such a nice man,

1:15:45.666 --> 1:15:47.668
in addition to being a brilliant scientist.

1:15:47.710 --> 1:15:51.214
And you never know where...

1:15:51.255 --> 1:15:53.966
where these conversations go. [Jun] Step by step, we can ask

1:15:54.008 --> 1:15:56.719
deeper, deeper questions,

1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:59.638
so we know we are making progress.

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:01.598
But how long it's going to get there?

1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.059
If you asked me that question,

1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:04.977
I couldn't really make that prediction

1:16:05.019 --> 1:16:08.105
because discovery itself is a very uncertain process.

1:16:10.024 --> 1:16:12.402
It's actually exciting that there remains to be

1:16:12.443 --> 1:16:14.862
very many mysteries out there

1:16:14.904 --> 1:16:17.240
that are waiting for us to discover.

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:22.119
[Anil] The history of science is full of examples

1:16:22.161 --> 1:16:24.955
where an understanding has been developed

1:16:24.997 --> 1:16:27.333
for something that seemed previously entirely mysterious.

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:29.043
And the reason it can do that

1:16:29.085 --> 1:16:31.170
is because it's a cumulative enterprise.

1:16:31.212 --> 1:16:33.005
You don't start from scratch.

1:16:33.047 --> 1:16:35.716
Every time in science, you're building on

1:16:35.758 --> 1:16:38.052
a whole tradition, not only of knowledge

1:16:38.094 --> 1:16:40.637
but also of methods and techniques.

1:16:59.490 --> 1:17:02.743
[woman] The mind is all the time processing all this stuff

1:17:02.785 --> 1:17:05.621
that it shouldn't have the capacity to process.

1:17:07.290 --> 1:17:09.833
One of these things is our experiences.

1:17:20.719 --> 1:17:22.472
How do we make sense of an event?

1:17:22.513 --> 1:17:24.557
Like you're, you're...

1:17:24.599 --> 1:17:26.392
Folks are watching this movie, and at the end of this movie,

1:17:26.434 --> 1:17:28.727
someone might be like, "Hey, how was<i> The Most Unknown?</i>

1:17:28.769 --> 1:17:30.980
How was that film?" And people will have an answer.

1:17:31.021 --> 1:17:32.565
How did they do that?

1:17:32.607 --> 1:17:34.358
Is your mind keeping a running ticker

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:35.776
of how good the movie is?

1:17:35.818 --> 1:17:37.069
They see the monkey parts,

1:17:37.111 --> 1:17:38.488
that was really good and it goes up.

1:17:38.529 --> 1:17:40.281
But, this physics... boring.

1:17:40.323 --> 1:17:42.408
But, so it turns out that

1:17:42.450 --> 1:17:45.161
when psychologists look at that, people simplify it.

1:17:45.202 --> 1:17:47.746
So people only take into account two points:

1:17:47.788 --> 1:17:50.374
the peak of how good it was and how it ended.

1:17:50.416 --> 1:17:52.585
That's all we're taking into account,

1:17:52.627 --> 1:17:54.878
which is kind of amazing.

1:17:54.920 --> 1:17:57.214
It means that the movie has to end really well.

1:17:57.256 --> 1:17:59.925
So, I'm glad I get to be the last scientist.

1:18:01.636 --> 1:18:03.762
We're here in Puerto Rico,

1:18:03.804 --> 1:18:06.056
and in a few minutes, we're going to be going to

1:18:06.098 --> 1:18:08.601
an even smaller island in the Caribbean,

1:18:08.643 --> 1:18:10.645
which is an island that's just off the coast of Puerto Rico

1:18:10.686 --> 1:18:12.229
called Cayo Santiago.

1:18:12.271 --> 1:18:16.733
It's home to about 1,000 free-ranging monkeys.

1:18:16.775 --> 1:18:18.694
Glasses fog up.

1:18:18.735 --> 1:18:21.030
[gasps] Puppy!

1:18:21.071 --> 1:18:23.491
I know! I know you don't these folks.

1:18:25.909 --> 1:18:27.744
You want non-shiny glasses.

1:18:27.786 --> 1:18:29.288
Non-shiny? So not these ones.

1:18:29.330 --> 1:18:30.914
Yeah, they won't like that.

1:18:30.956 --> 1:18:33.334
See? That's good advice. Yeah, I didn't...

1:18:33.376 --> 1:18:35.419
They'll see themselves, and it'll be very threatening.

1:18:35.461 --> 1:18:36.920
Ah, okay.

1:18:40.174 --> 1:18:41.300
<i>Hola!</i>

1:18:41.342 --> 1:18:43.010
It's prettier than the lab.

1:18:43.052 --> 1:18:46.180
-This is a lot prettier. -It's an early wake-up call,

1:18:46.222 --> 1:18:48.140
but it's really beautiful and you get to enjoy it.

1:18:48.182 --> 1:18:50.560
[Anil] It's fantastic.

1:18:55.147 --> 1:18:59.776
First question: What is the main motivation

1:18:55.147 --> 1:18:59.776
for your research out here?

1:18:59.818 --> 1:19:02.238
So, I... I am a psychologist,

1:19:02.279 --> 1:19:04.240
a cognitive psychologist by training,

1:19:04.281 --> 1:19:06.158
which means, I'm kind of interested in how humans think.

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:08.952
But I find it's really hard to test humans

1:19:08.994 --> 1:19:10.663
by testing humans.

1:19:10.705 --> 1:19:12.873
We have culture, we teach it.

1:19:12.915 --> 1:19:14.958
To get, to kind of get down to human cognition

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.586
without all the extra stuff is hard.

1:19:16.627 --> 1:19:18.879
And the beauty of the monkeys, as you'll see,

1:19:18.921 --> 1:19:21.173
is they're just being monkeys.

1:19:27.263 --> 1:19:28.681
You guys into Pokemon Go?

1:19:28.723 --> 1:19:30.140
There's really good Pokemon on the docks.

1:19:30.182 --> 1:19:32.226
I always try to catch the Pokemon.

1:19:32.268 --> 1:19:35.020
No one can get these 'cause they're here.

1:19:35.062 --> 1:19:36.897
However we're walking around the island,

1:19:36.939 --> 1:19:38.941
find a path that's, like,

1:19:38.982 --> 1:19:41.110
furthest from all monkeys.

1:19:41.151 --> 1:19:43.446
Staring at them right in the face is like a threat.

1:19:43.487 --> 1:19:45.656
If they get upset with you, you'll know about it.

1:19:45.698 --> 1:19:47.491
They'll start threatening you like, "Ah!"

1:19:47.533 --> 1:19:49.201
How close is this to

1:19:49.243 --> 1:19:51.495
the natural habitat they might have come from?

1:19:51.537 --> 1:19:54.123
Macaques are the most

1:19:54.164 --> 1:19:56.417
ubiquitous primate, other than humans.

1:19:56.459 --> 1:19:58.461
The lore is they treat us like walking trees.

1:19:58.502 --> 1:20:00.713
If we almost stepped on them, they would move.

1:20:00.755 --> 1:20:03.382
But we're just kind of part of their environment.

1:20:03.424 --> 1:20:06.469
We're a slightly bigger group with the camera

1:20:06.510 --> 1:20:09.430
than we normally would be, so some of them are like, "What?"

1:20:11.307 --> 1:20:13.643
Our group does cognition work down here,

1:20:13.684 --> 1:20:16.646
which means we're really setting up experiments.

1:20:16.687 --> 1:20:19.148
We have to kind of stay in a compact spot

1:20:19.189 --> 1:20:20.899
so we're not interfering with data.

1:20:25.279 --> 1:20:27.615
We're going to also get a little poolside show.

1:20:27.657 --> 1:20:29.742
Those are a bunch of kid monkeys.

1:20:29.784 --> 1:20:32.035
Who's gonna go for it?

1:20:32.077 --> 1:20:33.870
-Psych yourself up. -Great!

1:20:35.122 --> 1:20:37.708
But, it's... It's so high, right?

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:40.753
[Anil] So they... are they having fun?

1:20:40.795 --> 1:20:42.755
[Laurie] Yeah, this is playing.

1:20:49.094 --> 1:20:50.929
Maybe, do you think the female on the rock?

1:20:50.971 --> 1:20:52.515
-I was looking at her, yeah. -Yeah.

1:20:52.556 --> 1:20:55.100
So what we're going to do is,

1:20:55.142 --> 1:20:58.521
we're going show the monkeys a little show about what,

1:20:58.562 --> 1:21:01.440
what information Casey has about where an object is.

1:21:01.482 --> 1:21:03.734
So this one, she's going to do is the boring one.

1:21:03.776 --> 1:21:05.778
So, this is one that

1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:08.238
the monkeys shouldn't look for a very long time at all.

1:21:08.280 --> 1:21:10.324
They see her, watch it go into that box...

1:21:10.366 --> 1:21:12.075
and she reaches for it there.

1:21:12.117 --> 1:21:15.788
What we're looking for is long they watch that.

1:21:15.830 --> 1:21:17.956
You can see Shireen is behind her and she's filming

1:21:17.998 --> 1:21:20.250
how long they watch it.

1:21:20.292 --> 1:21:24.004
The expectation is the monkeys should lose interest

1:21:20.292 --> 1:21:24.004
more quickly.

1:21:24.046 --> 1:21:26.923
Is this something that works in controlled conditions,

1:21:26.965 --> 1:21:28.676
that monkeys can do, or...

1:21:28.718 --> 1:21:30.219
I think it would work under controlled conditions.

1:21:30.260 --> 1:21:31.970
But, you don't often in captivity have

1:21:32.012 --> 1:21:34.431
big enough sample sizes to do it.

1:21:34.473 --> 1:21:37.476
So, now the monkey is going to have a different belief

1:21:34.473 --> 1:21:37.476
than Casey.

1:21:37.518 --> 1:21:40.312
They see Casey watch it go into one spot,

1:21:40.354 --> 1:21:43.148
but then when Casey's not paying attention,

1:21:43.190 --> 1:21:45.275
the monkey can see a switch.

1:21:45.317 --> 1:21:47.236
Now...

1:21:47.277 --> 1:21:49.238
You can see this monkey doesn't seem to fine anymore.

1:21:49.279 --> 1:21:52.032
He's looking for a long time because it's unexpected.

1:21:54.076 --> 1:21:55.828
We're interested in whether the monkeys know

1:21:55.870 --> 1:21:59.498
that somebody has a different perspective than they do.

1:21:59.540 --> 1:22:02.042
We're expecting other minds

1:22:02.084 --> 1:22:03.878
to do these kind of jumps

1:22:03.919 --> 1:22:05.921
that our own minds do.

1:22:05.962 --> 1:22:08.632
It's not clear if they do the same thing.

1:22:11.802 --> 1:22:14.346
There's been this real question about whether another animal

1:22:14.388 --> 1:22:16.724
can think about what somebody else is thinking.

1:22:16.766 --> 1:22:19.435
Can they think about what somebody else sees?

1:22:21.186 --> 1:22:24.231
If monkeys know what other individuals see,

1:22:24.273 --> 1:22:27.276
they should use that information in productive ways.

1:22:27.317 --> 1:22:30.529
One productive way is in the concept of deception.

1:22:33.365 --> 1:22:37.202
We've got to find a nail or a stick.

1:22:37.244 --> 1:22:40.163
Most of monkey science happens with duct tape...

1:22:40.205 --> 1:22:41.832
and foam board.

1:22:44.501 --> 1:22:45.878
What are you making?

1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:47.337
We're going to make a little platform

1:22:47.379 --> 1:22:49.089
for them to steal grapes off of.

1:22:51.759 --> 1:22:54.637
We give them the opportunity to steal stuff from humans.

1:22:54.678 --> 1:22:57.055
The question is, do the monkeys steal more

1:22:57.097 --> 1:22:59.266
when folks aren't paying attention?

1:23:02.269 --> 1:23:04.939
This experiment is a first pass to see,

1:23:04.980 --> 1:23:08.108
can they use any of the social abilities they have

1:23:08.150 --> 1:23:09.735
to deceive us?

1:23:09.777 --> 1:23:11.445
Are they sensitive to this simple thing

1:23:11.487 --> 1:23:13.906
of what we can see, and what we can't see?

1:23:13.948 --> 1:23:17.075
Take one step towards them, like this.

1:23:17.117 --> 1:23:19.829
Then now, hold your platform horizontal, like this

1:23:19.870 --> 1:23:21.664
and show him the grape.

1:23:21.705 --> 1:23:25.125
Then place the grape down onto the shish kebab.

1:23:25.167 --> 1:23:27.002
Good.

1:23:27.043 --> 1:23:28.963
Now we're going to put the platform on the-- Hey! Wait!

1:23:29.004 --> 1:23:31.214
No, buddy. You've got to wait.

1:23:31.256 --> 1:23:33.717
Step back. Take your grape off.

1:23:33.759 --> 1:23:35.678
Yeah, he's very forceful.

1:23:35.719 --> 1:23:37.930
Nope, now you don't get to play 'cause you're being mean.

1:23:37.972 --> 1:23:40.474
We could try again but let's do it from slightly further back

1:23:40.516 --> 1:23:42.392
-So, we'll do it even from here. -Okay.

1:23:42.434 --> 1:23:44.520
Hey... Monkey!

1:23:46.313 --> 1:23:47.815
Okay, turn around.

1:23:50.484 --> 1:23:52.402
All right, he's...

1:23:52.444 --> 1:23:54.738
-I have no idea what's going on. -One sec.

1:23:54.780 --> 1:23:57.282
-You can turn around and grab the grape.

1:23:54.780 --> 1:23:57.282
-I can turn around?

1:23:57.324 --> 1:23:59.785
And turn around.

1:24:00.911 --> 1:24:03.330
Anything happening?

1:24:03.372 --> 1:24:05.666
They're staring at the film crew a little bit.

1:24:06.917 --> 1:24:09.670
Now he's threatening the film crew again.

1:24:09.712 --> 1:24:11.672
I'm trying to just stare off into the distance

1:24:11.714 --> 1:24:14.466
and pretend I'm not paying attention.

1:24:14.508 --> 1:24:17.052
What's fascinating here, is we just tried this experiment

1:24:17.093 --> 1:24:19.013
and it didn't really quite work.

1:24:19.054 --> 1:24:20.764
Typically, when we run these studies

1:24:20.806 --> 1:24:22.683
it's just two people, two grapes.

1:24:22.725 --> 1:24:24.309
No one else is around.

1:24:24.351 --> 1:24:26.979
Quite a large camera crew hanging around too...

1:24:27.021 --> 1:24:29.565
[Laurie] It fits with our hypothesis, right?

1:24:29.606 --> 1:24:31.316
The hypothesis of, monkeys see people are paying attention,

1:24:31.358 --> 1:24:34.361
they just hold back, they don't steal from anyone.

1:24:34.403 --> 1:24:38.198
And there's a lot of people here paying attention.

1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:40.158
They're very worried about the surveillance

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:42.578
that you guys started on their core island.

1:24:44.038 --> 1:24:45.956
[Laurie] Whatever we do down here, it's nice if

1:24:45.998 --> 1:24:48.584
other folks are doing similar work in other places,

1:24:48.625 --> 1:24:52.629
so we can triangulate what the animals really understand.

1:24:52.671 --> 1:24:54.840
Even when we find things that don't work,

1:24:54.882 --> 1:24:57.384
we replicate it, we try it again.

1:24:57.426 --> 1:24:59.636
Part of our task is to put the pattern together

1:24:59.678 --> 1:25:03.515
of what works and what doesn't.

1:25:03.557 --> 1:25:06.476
To be a scientist, you have to deal with uncertainty

1:25:03.557 --> 1:25:06.476
all the time.

1:25:07.937 --> 1:25:10.564
But you're just thinking about other possibilities

1:25:10.606 --> 1:25:12.441
in general.

1:25:12.482 --> 1:25:14.944
What if the world was this way?

1:25:14.985 --> 1:25:18.488
Science is all about holding multiple things in mind.

1:25:18.530 --> 1:25:21.491
And ultimately it's probably using

1:25:21.533 --> 1:25:23.619
these very same rudimentary capacities

1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:26.162
that we're seeing in the monkeys.

1:25:27.372 --> 1:25:29.458
Getting outside your own head

1:25:29.499 --> 1:25:32.878
is a lot of what science is about.

1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:35.881
That's what we're trying to do with the brains we have,

1:25:35.923 --> 1:25:39.175
to understand our place in the universe.

1:26:13.251 --> 1:26:15.587
You might think, watching scientists,

1:26:15.629 --> 1:26:18.132
that we go through a lot of frustrating things

1:26:18.173 --> 1:26:20.717
to do our science, like, why would we do it?

1:26:22.803 --> 1:26:24.805
Functionally, what scientists are doing is that

1:26:24.847 --> 1:26:27.223
we're trying to solve a really long mystery novel

1:26:27.265 --> 1:26:28.684
all the time.

1:26:28.725 --> 1:26:30.060
We get to the end of the chapter,

1:26:30.102 --> 1:26:31.687
and we think we've made progress.

1:26:31.728 --> 1:26:34.148
but then there's a new door and a new twist!

1:26:34.189 --> 1:26:36.817
For us, that's fun, that there's more to go.

1:26:38.568 --> 1:26:39.987
Are you Jen?

1:26:40.029 --> 1:26:42.031
-Hi, I'm Jen! -It's good to meet you.

1:26:42.072 --> 1:26:43.740
I'm going to give you a hug. I feel like I know you already.

1:26:43.782 --> 1:26:45.742
I can't believe you made it here before I did.

1:26:45.784 --> 1:26:48.162
I was so excited about the caves, I couldn't help myself.

1:26:50.205 --> 1:26:51.623
So, let's see...

1:26:51.665 --> 1:26:53.125
Suit.

1:26:57.713 --> 1:26:59.756
All right, I've got to figure out how this hat works.

1:26:59.798 --> 1:27:01.383
Is it, like...

1:27:01.424 --> 1:27:03.177
See, there's a...

1:27:03.218 --> 1:27:05.179
-a little button there. -Oh, yeah.

1:27:07.222 --> 1:27:08.849
I think you gave me a broken one.

1:27:10.809 --> 1:27:13.436
One thing I feel at a gut level

1:27:13.478 --> 1:27:15.271
is that humans get smarter,

1:27:15.313 --> 1:27:17.566
the more different things they experience.

1:27:20.777 --> 1:27:23.197
We can't possibly imagine the things that

1:27:23.238 --> 1:27:26.491
we might learn, that might be useful to us.

1:27:27.784 --> 1:27:31.788
We're slowly creeping towards understanding.

1:27:31.830 --> 1:27:34.499
But we're... We're sort of toward the beginning.
