00:01.968 --> 00:05.405
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.405 --> 00:09.492
I know, Dad, but still...

00:09.492 --> 00:11.795
Well, whatever you think is best, Dad.

00:11.795 --> 00:13.296
Right.

00:13.296 --> 00:16.299
Bye, Dad.

00:16.299 --> 00:17.167
That was my dad.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.918
Really.

00:18.918 --> 00:22.305
Yeah, he's threatening to make
me move back home to Indiana.

00:22.305 --> 00:24.174
He's been talking to my Uncle Fergie.

00:24.174 --> 00:25.642
The guy who was here last week?

00:25.642 --> 00:27.010
I thought he had a great time.

00:27.010 --> 00:28.261
Well, he did.

00:28.261 --> 00:31.264
But all he told them about was
the two times he got mugged.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.099
Oh, that was just bad luck. Yeah.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.067
Woody, you've lived here two years.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.068
How many times you been mugged?

00:35.068 --> 00:36.352
Ten. But...

00:37.737 --> 00:40.023
You know, that's including the
two times with Uncle Fergie.

00:40.023 --> 00:41.574
Oh.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.911
So now my parents are convinced
that Boston is a dangerous town

00:44.911 --> 00:47.163
and all my friends are seedy lowlifes.

00:47.163 --> 00:49.499
Well, surely they don't want
you to go back to Indiana

00:49.499 --> 00:50.867
because we're a corrupting influence.

00:50.867 --> 00:51.618
Well, who knows?

00:51.618 --> 00:54.621
Somehow, they got the idea
that every guy in Boston

00:54.621 --> 00:56.506
is some lonely, pathetic weirdo.

00:56.506 --> 00:58.458
Look, is this or is this not

00:58.458 --> 00:59.959
the spitting image of George Schultz?

01:02.846 --> 01:05.131
So, uh, Woody, what
time does your bus leave?

01:07.550 --> 01:11.471
(piano plays)

01:11.471 --> 01:13.940
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:13.940 --> 01:16.943
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:16.943 --> 01:19.946
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:19.946 --> 01:22.949
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:22.949 --> 01:28.204
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:28.204 --> 01:30.990
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:30.990 --> 01:35.995
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:35.995 --> 01:41.000
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.002
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:43.002 --> 01:46.005
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:46.005 --> 01:51.010
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:51.010 --> 01:54.013
? You want to go where people know ?

01:54.013 --> 01:56.015
? People are all the same ?

01:56.015 --> 02:01.020
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.973
Okay, let's take it again.

02:19.973 --> 02:20.974
(everyone groans)

02:20.974 --> 02:22.358
Diane, do we really
have to do this again?

02:22.358 --> 02:24.277
We all agreed that the best way

02:24.277 --> 02:26.279
to persuade Woody's
parents to let him stay

02:26.779 --> 02:28.781
was to show them how
decent and upstanding

02:28.781 --> 02:29.649
his friends are, right?

02:29.649 --> 02:31.568
(muttering agreement) Okay.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.036
And what better way to show them

02:33.036 --> 02:35.538
than by making a film
of his everyday life?

02:35.538 --> 02:38.541
And who better to serve
as auteur than the person

02:38.541 --> 02:40.543
who ruined the curve in
her film techniques class.

02:40.543 --> 02:43.546
Hey, Diane, shoot the damn film.

02:43.546 --> 02:47.050
Would you tell Fellini
"Shoot the damn film"?

02:47.050 --> 02:49.552
Would you tell Antonioni
"Shoot the damn film"?

02:50.053 --> 02:52.055
Would you tell Bergman
"Shoot the damn film"?

02:52.055 --> 02:55.508
No, I'm telling you,
shoot the damn film.

02:55.508 --> 02:59.896
Better yet, shoot the damn Diane.

02:59.896 --> 03:01.264
Please.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.765
A little more reverence

03:02.765 --> 03:04.267
for the words I've written.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.268
DIANE: Stick to the script.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.270
And try to be spontaneous.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.273
Okay.

03:10.773 --> 03:15.778
Take 17, "Man-child in Beantown."

03:17.664 --> 03:19.532
Action!

03:19.532 --> 03:22.919
"You know, when, the average
Joe like me gets off work,

03:22.919 --> 03:24.921
"he needs to come to a place like this

03:24.921 --> 03:28.091
where he can sort of unwind
with his surrogate family."

03:29.209 --> 03:31.544
"Took the words right
out of my mouth, Norm.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.546
"But it feels as if

03:33.546 --> 03:36.299
a, uh, crucial part of our
support system is missing."

03:36.299 --> 03:37.600
"You're right.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.852
Uh, what do you think
that would be, Carla?"

03:39.852 --> 03:44.641
"Could it be that bucolic
ray of sunshine from Indiana?"

03:44.641 --> 03:45.642
Stupid.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.143
This whole thing is stupid, Diane!

03:48.561 --> 03:50.446
People, people, work
with me! Work with me!

03:54.484 --> 03:55.485
I hate that. I hate...

03:55.485 --> 03:56.736
"People, people..."

03:56.736 --> 03:58.037
Please, Sam.

03:58.037 --> 03:59.539
All right, all right.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.541
Um, "You're right. Woody's not here.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.959
"The place seems so empty

04:02.959 --> 04:04.961
without his smiling countenance."

04:08.665 --> 04:10.667
"Hello, buddies."

04:10.667 --> 04:13.169
ALL: "Hello, Woody!"

04:13.169 --> 04:19.509
"Come on over and join
us for some male bonding."

04:19.509 --> 04:20.927
"Well, that sounds good,

04:20.927 --> 04:22.812
but first, I have to call my mother."

04:22.812 --> 04:24.564
GROUP: Awwww...!

04:24.564 --> 04:26.599
"Yeah, it sure is
refreshing to see a son

04:27.100 --> 04:28.101
"being so considerate of his mother.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.103
Isn't it, Carla?"

04:30.603 --> 04:32.355
It's stupid!

04:34.524 --> 04:38.077
"You know, my lovely and cherished..."

04:38.077 --> 04:40.113
Fawn-like.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.449
"...fawn-like bride-to-be,
Diane Chambers..."

04:44.951 --> 04:46.869
You're right, Carla, this is stupid.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.871
The whole thing is stupid!

04:48.871 --> 04:51.374
I mean, why can't we
just use our own words?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.759
Be ourselves here?

04:52.759 --> 04:54.627
Fine, Mr. Smarty Pants.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.513
You're such an expert,
you take the camera.

04:57.513 --> 04:58.514
Go ahead. All right.

04:58.514 --> 04:59.515
All right, I will.

04:59.515 --> 05:01.517
Just don't come crying to me

05:01.517 --> 05:04.520
when the whole
mise-en-scene deteriorates.

05:06.022 --> 05:09.525
You'll find that film is an exacting art

05:09.525 --> 05:11.027
requiring a lot more

05:11.027 --> 05:14.397
than just knowing where
the "on" button is.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.148
Good luck.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.150
Yeah, well, we don't need any luck.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.151
And we don't need you, either...

05:18.151 --> 05:19.535
Cinema Puss.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.708
Where is the "on" button on this?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.000
SAM: Oh, good, good, good, good.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.336
You're just in time
to see our masterpiece.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.588
Should I alert Pauline Kael?

05:38.588 --> 05:39.889
Well, if you want to,
but tell her to get

05:40.390 --> 05:41.891
her butt in gear, we're about to start.

05:43.393 --> 05:46.229
Cliffie, get the lights there.

05:46.229 --> 05:48.097
CARLA: Yeah, come on.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.402
SAM: This part was my idea.

05:52.402 --> 05:53.770
Look at this.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.072
DIANE: Startlingly original
use of the subjective camera.

05:56.072 --> 05:57.573
SAM: No, not really.

05:57.573 --> 06:01.577
They use it in all your
finer chain saw movies.

06:01.577 --> 06:03.830
WOODY: Hi, Mom! Dad!

06:03.830 --> 06:05.164
What a surprise!

06:05.164 --> 06:07.667
I was hoping you'd get
to see where I worked.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.670
Welcome to the best bar in Boston.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.673
Pretty wholesome and
unseedy looking, huh?

06:13.673 --> 06:16.676
And here are the best and
most uncorrupting friends

06:16.676 --> 06:18.678
a guy could hope to have.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.180
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd!

06:22.682 --> 06:25.518
WOODY: First, I'd like ya to
meet my boss and good friend,

06:25.518 --> 06:26.519
Sam Malone.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.020
Sam used to be a relief pitcher

06:28.020 --> 06:29.522
for the Boston Red Sox.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.974
Now he owns Cheers.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.477
Hi! This is Sam's office.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.479
And over there, that's Sam.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.481
He's more than just a boss to me.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.484
He's like the big brother I never had.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.987
Well, except for Tom.

06:44.987 --> 06:45.988
Hi, Woody.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.408
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.410
Another good friend, Mr. Norm Peterson,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.912
has been kind enough to
run the camera for us today.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.335
So, uh, Sam, you're, you're
reading the Bible again huh?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.337
Well, yeah, I...

07:01.337 --> 07:03.840
didn't think I was gonna get caught.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.225
Yes, I was just, uh, enjoying

07:06.225 --> 07:10.646
St. Paul's, uh, Epistle
to the Galatians.

07:10.646 --> 07:12.064
Boy, those Galatians.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.517
When will they listen, huh?

07:17.019 --> 07:18.521
Woody, uh, what's going on?

07:18.521 --> 07:22.024
Oh, well, I have a
little dilemma here, Sam.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.527
My father might call me back home

07:24.527 --> 07:27.330
and, uh, if he does-- and
I sure hope he doesn't--

07:27.330 --> 07:28.831
what am I gonna do with this?

07:28.831 --> 07:30.333
(puppy whimpering)

07:30.333 --> 07:33.336
I mean, after all, what kind of a place

07:33.836 --> 07:36.339
is a small farm to raise a puppy?

07:37.840 --> 07:40.343
I was hoping you could take him, Sam.

07:40.343 --> 07:42.345
Well, gee, Woody, I don't have the room.

07:42.345 --> 07:43.346
I guess you'll just have to put

07:43.346 --> 07:47.850
the poor little fella to sleep.

07:47.850 --> 07:49.852
Put this poor puppy to sleep

07:50.353 --> 07:52.855
because I have to leave Boston?

07:52.855 --> 07:55.858
Well, if that's what my father wants...

07:57.860 --> 07:59.362
What a shame, Woody.

07:59.362 --> 08:01.364
What kind of dog is it?

08:01.364 --> 08:06.786
What's the difference? He's gonna die.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.788
Well, maybe your daddy
will let you stay here

08:09.288 --> 08:10.790
and take care of him.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.159
I'd sure prefer that.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.460
What about you, pooch?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.412
Would you prefer that to dying?

08:20.500 --> 08:24.921
Subtle tug at the old
heartstrings there, guys.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.306
(crying): Boy, I'll say.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.060
Hey, shut up, everybody,
you're missing my yard.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.347
Hi! Welcome to our cookout.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.349
Another chicken leg, Mr. Peterson?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.351
Oh, well, nah... yeah!

08:38.351 --> 08:39.852
What the hey, it looks pretty good

08:39.852 --> 08:41.354
if I do say so myself.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.606
(chuckles)

08:43.606 --> 08:47.944
This is my co-worker
here, Carla Tortelli.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.445
Hi.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.447
FRASIER: What do we have here?

08:51.447 --> 08:52.448
Uh, this is just the
sort of family type thing

08:52.448 --> 08:53.950
we do here in Boston.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.952
(Frasier yelling)

08:57.954 --> 08:59.956
Hi.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.458
Say something besides "hi."

09:02.959 --> 09:03.960
Hello.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.929
(jet airplane whines)

09:06.929 --> 09:07.930
You hear that?

09:08.431 --> 09:10.433
Well, uh, Carla lives
near the airport so...

09:10.433 --> 09:15.438
(airplane roars)

09:15.438 --> 09:18.441
...actually, sometimes,
it's hard to hear.

09:18.441 --> 09:21.444
Why wasn't I invited?

09:21.444 --> 09:22.945
You didn't miss much, Diane.

09:22.945 --> 09:24.447
Carla's kids stole the beef

09:24.447 --> 09:27.316
and then they stuck
Woody's shoes on the fire.

09:27.316 --> 09:30.236
NORM (on film): More
smoked tongue, anyone?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.238
FRASIER: Give me that!

09:32.238 --> 09:34.740
(Frasier yelling)

09:36.042 --> 09:38.544
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd. I'm...

09:39.545 --> 09:41.547
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.050
I'm Cliff Clavin, a good pal of Woody's

09:44.050 --> 09:47.553
and a proud member of
the U.S. Postal Service.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.055
Come on along with me and I'll show you

09:49.555 --> 09:52.558
the kind of work we do
routinely at the USPS.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.510
CLIFF (on film): Morning, Woody.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.394
Hi, Mr. Clavin.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.897
Hi, Judy!

09:57.897 --> 10:00.266
Well, let's see what
we got in the mail bag.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.184
CLIFF: Well, look at this!

10:02.184 --> 10:03.686
It's a letter all the way from Guam

10:03.686 --> 10:05.688
to a man right here in Boston.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.190
Wow! It's made it this
far, and it's up to me

10:08.190 --> 10:10.076
to see that it gets where it's intended.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.329
Woody, I could get in
big trouble for that.

10:13.829 --> 10:14.830
Oh.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.699
I'm only one link
in this chain--

10:17.199 --> 10:19.702
a strong link, a vital link...

10:19.702 --> 10:21.120
A missing link.

10:23.506 --> 10:24.757
Come on in.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.711
Pretty impressive, huh, Woody?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.713
Sure is, Mr. Clavin.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.215
Hey, just think, all these letters

10:33.215 --> 10:36.218
traveling thousands of miles
over oceans and rough terrain,

10:36.218 --> 10:39.555
right into the hands of
their, uh, intended addressees.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.940
Hey, why thanks, Woody.

10:40.940 --> 10:41.941
You did that pretty well.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.442
Thanks.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.945
Would, uh, would you like
to try one on your own?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.197
Well, gee, Mr. Clavin, I'm
not a government employee.

10:48.197 --> 10:49.565
(chuckling): Pretty good, Woody.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.033
I was just testing him.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.451
Smart boy.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.904
Yeah, Woods, next time

10:54.904 --> 10:56.706
you lick a stamp and
put it on an envelope,

10:56.706 --> 10:58.207
drop it in that old mailbox,

10:58.207 --> 11:00.209
be sure to give some thought to, uh,

11:00.209 --> 11:02.628
the thousands of men and women
in the U.S. Postal Service

11:02.628 --> 11:04.630
who work very hard, day after day,

11:04.630 --> 11:08.501
to make sure that your
mail is delivered safely.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.502
(chuckles)

11:09.502 --> 11:10.503
You know, Woods,

11:11.003 --> 11:12.505
you'd make a good
postal carrier yourself.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.007
Yeah? You've got, uh, youth, stamina

11:15.007 --> 11:17.009
and a friend down at the post office.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.512
Oh, who's that, Mr. Clavin?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.932
But then again, bartending
is a noble profession.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.934
But, Woody, you know
there's nothing quite like

11:24.934 --> 11:27.937
the pride a postman feels
on the swift completion

11:27.937 --> 11:29.438
of his appointed rounds.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.440
(doors opening)

11:40.700 --> 11:42.752
WOODY: You don't have to
worry about me going hungry

11:42.752 --> 11:44.587
if I stay here in Boston.

11:44.587 --> 11:47.540
This town is famous for its
finer health food restaurants.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.041
Hi.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.544
And the best of them
all is the Hungry Heifer.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.045
That's right, Woody.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.014
WOODY: I found out about this place

11:55.014 --> 11:58.517
through a guy who's helped me
plan my life here in Boston,

11:58.517 --> 12:02.521
a good friend and my financial
advisor, Mr. Norm Peterson.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.023
Hi.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.524
Are you hungry?

12:09.028 --> 12:11.530
CUSTOMERS: Norm!

12:14.950 --> 12:17.036
Uh, nice place, huh?

12:17.036 --> 12:19.538
Yeah, normally, for
this sort of ambiance,

12:19.538 --> 12:21.991
you'd have to travel to Albuquerque.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.493
Hi, Corinne.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.494
Hi, honey.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.496
Studying at the feet of the master?

12:27.496 --> 12:28.497
Huh?

12:28.497 --> 12:29.999
What can I get you, Norm?

12:29.999 --> 12:33.002
The, uh, Feeding Frenzy Special for two.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.006
How about you, honey?

12:37.006 --> 12:40.009
Well, I think he was
ordering for both of us.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.011
No. No.

12:42.011 --> 12:46.015
Oh, well, give me just one.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.517
Anything for you, Sam?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.520
Smart move.

13:18.180 --> 13:20.182
Oh,  Corinne, I think you
forgot the, uh, French fries.

13:20.182 --> 13:23.185
Don't you wanna save room for dessert?

13:23.185 --> 13:25.688
You're one step ahead of me.

13:25.688 --> 13:30.276
They take care of you here.

13:30.276 --> 13:34.196
Finally I want you to meet my
good friend, Dr. Frasier Crane.

13:34.196 --> 13:37.700
Now, I know what you always
said about psychiatrists, Dad,

13:37.700 --> 13:40.703
but, uh, he's not a crook
or a nut case or anything.

13:40.703 --> 13:42.705
He's a pretty smart guy.

13:42.705 --> 13:44.707
Well, here you go, Dr. Crane.

13:44.707 --> 13:46.709
FRASIER: Thank you, Woody.

13:48.711 --> 13:51.213
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd,

13:51.213 --> 13:53.716
in Woody, you have raised

13:53.716 --> 13:55.718
a young man of singular character,

13:55.718 --> 13:58.721
not easily swayed by the
attitudes of those around him.

13:58.721 --> 14:01.056
Trust him. Trust yourselves.

14:01.056 --> 14:04.560
Let him do what he
wants to with his life.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.563
Now, let me address
some of your reservations

14:07.563 --> 14:10.482
about the psychiatric profession.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.938
In this building, you see 18 floors

14:15.938 --> 14:19.441
of highly trained,
dedicated professionals,

14:19.441 --> 14:22.945
whose sole purpose is to heal the mind.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.446
And, you know, I think my mentor...

14:25.865 --> 14:28.417
Norm, Norm, could you run
that back for me, please?

14:28.417 --> 14:30.419
FRASIER (on film): ...seek to find...

14:30.419 --> 14:33.839
(audio playing backwards)

14:33.839 --> 14:35.841
...you know, I think my mentor...

14:37.343 --> 14:38.794
I've gotta tell Dr. Judd
to keep his windows closed

14:38.794 --> 14:40.679
during his depression seminar.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.849
Well, uh, what'd you think?

14:43.849 --> 14:44.850
After seeing that, I think

14:44.850 --> 14:46.218
we should all move to Indiana.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.059
I don't know how you guys did it,

14:54.059 --> 14:57.613
but you made me out as,
uh, some kind of a jerk.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.400
Well, talk about movie magic, huh?

15:03.285 --> 15:05.571
Maybe you're just too close
to the subject, huh, Cliff?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.873
No, I thought he
looked like a jerk, too.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.376
Yeah, you all look like jerks to me.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.795
Oh...

15:12.795 --> 15:13.796
May I say something?

15:13.796 --> 15:14.797
Go ahead, go ahead.

15:14.797 --> 15:16.298
Tell me how right you were.

15:16.298 --> 15:17.800
Get it over with.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.301
On the contrary,

15:19.301 --> 15:22.221
I was about to say that I don't think

15:22.221 --> 15:25.724
any of these people realize
what a fine job you did.

15:25.724 --> 15:26.725
Oh, right.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.227
No, I mean that.

15:28.727 --> 15:29.728
What you have here

15:29.728 --> 15:32.731
is the raw material
for a truly fine film.

15:33.232 --> 15:33.732
Well, thank you.

15:33.732 --> 15:36.235
The problem is entirely
with its structure.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.236
It's too linear.

15:37.236 --> 15:40.489
Yeah, that was gnawing at me, too.

15:40.489 --> 15:42.274
We need to make a film that appeals

15:42.274 --> 15:43.776
to the emotions, not the intellect.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.277
If you'll allow me,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.279
I can transform your film

15:47.279 --> 15:50.282
into a shattering emotional experience.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.784
What are you gonna do to it?

15:51.784 --> 15:55.671
Oh, a snip here, a snip
there, nothing much.

15:56.021 --> 16:02.494
(Wagner's "Ride of
the Valkyrie" playing)

16:27.319 --> 16:30.823
DIANE: In a world gone mad,

16:30.823 --> 16:32.424
where can a young man go?

16:32.424 --> 16:34.526
Where? Where?

16:34.526 --> 16:35.661
Tell me where?

16:37.696 --> 16:40.499
ALL: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.735
WOODY: And here are the
best and most uncorrupting

16:42.735 --> 16:45.971
friends a guy could hope to have.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.773
First, I'd like you to meet my boss

16:47.773 --> 16:48.907
and good friend, Sam Malone.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.609
Sam used to be a relief pitcher

16:50.609 --> 16:51.677
for the Boston Red Sox.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.092
Uh, this is just the sort

17:07.425 --> 17:09.762
of family-type thing
we do here in Boston.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.564
ALL: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.266
Welcome to our cookout.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.570
(mooing)

17:19.570 --> 17:21.339
Another chicken leg, Mr. Peterson?

17:21.339 --> 17:23.375
(clucking, squawking)

17:29.314 --> 17:30.983
Be sure to give some thought to, uh,

17:30.983 --> 17:32.651
the thousands of men
and women in uniform.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.262
(bleating)

17:46.198 --> 17:50.202
In Woody, you have raised a
young man of singular character,

17:50.569 --> 17:53.038
not easily swayed by the
attitudes of those around him.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.175
Trust him. Trust yourselves.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.544
Let him do what he
wants to with his life.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.312
DIANE: Shouldn't we all have the chance

18:00.312 --> 18:03.348
to live our lives the way we choose?

18:03.348 --> 18:08.153
Please, give us that chance
in the time we have left.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.835
(explosion thundering)

18:30.859 --> 18:32.828
(Diane sighs)

18:37.116 --> 18:39.952
Well?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.920
(muttering, murmuring)

18:41.920 --> 18:43.672
NORM: Gee, uh, you know...

18:43.672 --> 18:46.508
Oh, you're hurt because
I was the only one

18:46.508 --> 18:48.010
who had a credit at the end.

18:48.010 --> 18:50.012
(all disagreeing)

18:50.012 --> 18:51.013
You keep the credits.

18:51.013 --> 18:53.015
DIANE: Oh, thanks.

18:53.015 --> 18:56.518
It's just that I felt
I transformed your film

18:56.518 --> 19:02.391
into a personal statement
that was pure Diane Chambers.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.693
It was pure something.

19:06.195 --> 19:07.196
I don't know, Miss Chambers.

19:07.196 --> 19:09.198
Maybe we better not send
this film to my folks.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.700
Oh, Woody, it's a fait accompli.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.202
Was it ever.

19:13.202 --> 19:17.206
No, I mean, I've already
sent a copy to your father.

19:17.206 --> 19:18.991
For all we know, he may be

19:18.991 --> 19:21.076
viewing it as we speak.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.378
Oh, I think that's a mistake.

19:23.378 --> 19:24.880
Why?

19:24.880 --> 19:30.836
Well, your film, uh,
didn't have enough...

19:30.836 --> 19:33.222
well, there, there was too much...

19:33.222 --> 19:35.224
it needed a little, uh...

19:35.224 --> 19:38.510
Yeah, and it stunk, too.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.513
Thank you, Siskel and Ebert.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.517
Take my word for it,
after Woody's father

19:45.517 --> 19:48.437
sees this impassioned plea
for individual freedom,

19:48.437 --> 19:51.440
there is no way he will
be able to order Woody

19:51.440 --> 19:53.442
to leave here against his will.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.327
Well, I guess this is good-bye, then.

19:58.747 --> 20:01.333
I just can't believe
you're leaving us, Woody.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.502
Are you sure my film

20:03.502 --> 20:06.505
had no effect on your father?

20:06.505 --> 20:08.006
Oh, come on, face it.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.508
All that weird stuff

20:09.508 --> 20:12.010
wouldn't mean anything
to a guy like Mr. Boyd.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.512
Yeah. Besides, he thought

20:13.512 --> 20:16.765
it was too derivative of Godard.

20:21.186 --> 20:23.689
You sure you don't mind if
I take this picture, Sam?

20:23.689 --> 20:26.692
No, I want you to have it.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.694
While we're at it, Woody,

20:28.694 --> 20:30.195
here.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.197
Oh, one of your Elvis earrings.

20:32.698 --> 20:33.699
Yeah.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.652
Well, he was one of
a kind and so are you.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.153
Oh...

20:38.153 --> 20:40.155
Besides, the guy I went
out with last night,

20:40.155 --> 20:42.157
he swallowed the other one.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.660
Here.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.161
I want you to have this.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.163
It's a copy of Being and Nothingness.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.166
My mother gave it to me in grade school.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.670
Aw, thanks, Miss Chambers.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.557
I don't think I've read this one.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.893
Woody, uh...

21:01.893 --> 21:03.395
a six-pack.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.397
All the, uh, beer you've

21:05.397 --> 21:06.898
poured me over the years, you know.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.400
Thanks a lot, Mr. Peterson.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.901
CLIFF: So, Woods, uh,

21:09.901 --> 21:12.404
I've got a sheet of
commemorative stamps here

21:12.404 --> 21:14.906
depicting, uh, all the U.S. Presidents,

21:14.906 --> 21:16.908
uh, well, except nine.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.411
That's great.

21:19.411 --> 21:20.912
Thank you, Mr. Clavin.

21:26.418 --> 21:27.419
See, I didn't know,

21:27.419 --> 21:29.921
I didn't know we were giving gifts.

21:31.923 --> 21:34.426
I could, uh, could I send you something?

21:34.426 --> 21:36.928
Ah, that's fine, Dr. Crane.

21:40.932 --> 21:44.436
It's... been an honor
knowing you, Woody.

21:44.936 --> 21:46.438
You know, if somebody had told me,

21:46.438 --> 21:48.307
I could've picked something up.

21:51.193 --> 21:54.196
Uh... I gotta go.

21:54.196 --> 21:55.697
I'll walk you to the car.

21:55.697 --> 21:57.699
No, no, no, I... I
wanna remember you guys

21:57.699 --> 21:59.067
the way you're standing.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.826
Bye, Woody.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.333
Well, hell, we don't have

22:14.333 --> 22:16.335
to stand around here forever, do we?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.086
Does anybody know his shirt size?

22:18.086 --> 22:20.555
(phone ringing)

22:20.555 --> 22:24.559
Come on, let me buy you all
a beer on the house, here.

22:24.559 --> 22:25.560
No, none for me, Sammy.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.561
CARLA: Hello, Cheers.

22:26.561 --> 22:28.063
Beer's just gonna remind me of the kid.

22:28.063 --> 22:29.564
It'll be quite some time

22:29.564 --> 22:31.066
before I can even touch one again.

22:33.068 --> 22:36.571
Well, that oughta do it, I guess.

22:38.073 --> 22:39.574
Hey, hey, it's Woody's dad.

22:39.574 --> 22:41.076
Get him! Get him!

22:41.076 --> 22:42.577
Oh, oh!

22:42.577 --> 22:44.079
Woody!

22:44.079 --> 22:46.581
Woody, your father's on the phone.

22:49.584 --> 22:52.087
Hey, guys, how you been?

22:52.087 --> 22:55.841
Hello? Dad?

22:59.094 --> 23:00.595
Really?

23:00.595 --> 23:02.097
Oh, well, thank you. Thank you.

23:02.097 --> 23:04.099
You don't know how happy this makes me.

23:04.099 --> 23:06.601
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye!

23:06.601 --> 23:08.603
Oh, I can stay!

23:12.391 --> 23:13.608
Oh, Woody!

23:13.608 --> 23:16.027
Yeah, after reflecting on my film,

23:16.027 --> 23:20.399
he was finally moved
by its timeless message.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.317
No, he tossed it in the thresher.

23:24.703 --> 23:26.154
Well, what, what happened, Woody?

23:26.154 --> 23:27.155
Someone sent him

23:27.155 --> 23:29.157
a real simple note
that changed his mind.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.542
What did it say?

23:30.542 --> 23:33.044
It said, "Let your
son choose his own path

23:33.044 --> 23:35.046
and it will always lead back to you."

23:35.046 --> 23:37.048
Oh, how eloquent.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.050
Yeah, but it wasn't signed.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.552
Hey, come on, guys, fess up.

23:40.552 --> 23:42.053
Who did it?

23:44.556 --> 23:46.057
CLIFF: Oh, not me. No.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.342
Don't look at me.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.009
Carla?

23:48.009 --> 23:49.895
Yeah, right.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.397
I sure wish I knew who it
was, so I could thank them.

23:52.397 --> 23:55.650
Don't mention it, kid.
