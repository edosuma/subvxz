WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:08.008
MAN:
I am here
in Shenandoah State Park.

00:08.842 --> 00:12.146
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:13.181 --> 00:16.117
Ah, I love that creek.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.018
Wow.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.222
( birds chirping )

00:30.131 --> 00:32.233
( man yelling )

00:38.539 --> 00:42.243
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:42.276 --> 00:45.713
and CBS

01:19.247 --> 01:20.614
He did that? You're kidding.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.616
WOMAN:
No, I'm not.
( laughs )

01:22.650 --> 01:25.486
Well, I wouldn't put it
in my romantic column, Deb.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.721
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, it's definitely kinky.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.591
Affectionate.
Maybe affectionately odd, but...

01:30.624 --> 01:32.593
I mean, I don't find
anything romantic

01:32.626 --> 01:34.562
about having sex with....

01:34.595 --> 01:36.697
( clears throat ):
I'll call you back later.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.598
Sex with a what?

01:37.631 --> 01:38.699
None of your business.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.633
Another woman?

01:39.667 --> 01:40.601
Go back to your desk, Tony.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.336
Another man?
I told you...

01:42.370 --> 01:43.371
Some kind of root vegetable?

01:43.404 --> 01:44.838
You're disgusting.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.676
Wasn't me having a conversation
about kinky sex, Kate.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.512
It was a private
conversation, Tony,
something you seem

01:51.545 --> 01:52.713
to have a difficult time with.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.682
If I'd been having
that conversation,

01:54.715 --> 01:56.484
you'd accuse me
of being a Neanderthal.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.619
Well, that doesn't require
a conversation, Tony.

01:58.652 --> 01:59.720
You know what I think, Kate?

01:59.753 --> 02:02.423
I think there's
a secret side to you,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.792
a Spike Steel video
kind of side.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.494
Keep it hidden
under your mattress?

02:06.527 --> 02:07.761
Leave now.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.729
( laughs ):
Oh...

02:08.762 --> 02:10.864
You're a Spike
Steel fan, aren't
you, Probie?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.266
What, the porn star?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.801
No, the physicist.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.404
Uh, no, not really.
Looks kind of sleazy.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.338
( laughs )

02:17.371 --> 02:19.740
Actually, he looks
a little bit like Tony.

02:19.773 --> 02:23.744
Oh, you have no idea
how much he looks like me.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.646
Kate, how do you know
what he looks like?

02:25.679 --> 02:29.717
I saw him on the news when
he was arrested a few years ago.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.320
Really?

02:37.691 --> 02:40.461
Spike Steel's real name
is Jay McMann,

02:40.494 --> 02:42.330
and according
to the National Crime Database,

02:42.363 --> 02:44.432
he's never been arrested, ever.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.966
GIBBS:
What're you waiting for,
DiNozzo?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.835
Uh...
Gas the truck.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.637
I knew that.
McGee, get Ducky.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.372
Uh, what am I telling him, boss?

02:51.405 --> 02:53.874
We have a dead Marine
in Shenandoah River State Park.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.310
Come on, let's go.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.849
( water flowing )

03:01.882 --> 03:03.717
MAN:
Sergeant
William Moore.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.719
Call came in
from his wife.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.922
GIBBS:
The friend?
Sergeant Roger Caine.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.858
All camping together.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.694
This morning they were
gonna hike this trail.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.863
Sergeant Moore went ahead early
to film the sunrise.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.698
When they couldn't find him,
they called us.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.334
Early in the morning,
it's really slippery up here.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.436
The Sergeant lost
his traction and slipped.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.706
You a trained investigator...

03:25.739 --> 03:27.775
Ranger Kett?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.810
Been working this park
five years, Agent Gibbs.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.612
It's as treacherous
as it comes up here.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.382
Seen a lot of
hikers go over.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.617
This hiker was a Marine.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.687
Yeah, well, this Marine
slipped and fell to his death.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.289
You said he was filming.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.623
That's what
his wife said.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.891
No sign of the camera.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.726
Me and my team can
take it from here.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.501
KATE ( sighs ):
Wonder what happened to McGee.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.003
Probably passed out on
the side of the trail
sucking his thumb.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.872
He joined a gym, you know.
Is that right?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.741
McGEE:
Wait up!

04:00.774 --> 04:02.576
He should get
his money back.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.944
Where the hell you been?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.546
Ducky needed some
help with his gear.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.714
How much further is it?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.881
It's another
quarter of a mile.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.049
Uphill.
( McGee groans )

04:11.919 --> 04:14.888
Stamina, Probie-- it's very
important in our profession.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.890
As it is in Spike
Steel's profession.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.759
You relate to him,
don't you Tony?

04:18.792 --> 04:21.028
Oh, we have a
lot in common.
Stamina?

04:21.061 --> 04:22.863
For one.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.565
( camera shutter clicking )

04:24.598 --> 04:26.867
DUCKY:
What are your
preliminary findings,

04:26.900 --> 04:28.902
Mr. Palmer?
Uh, lacerations,

04:28.936 --> 04:31.004
bruises, contusions,

04:31.038 --> 04:32.773
consistent with
a fall of this kind.

04:32.806 --> 04:33.774
And?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.743
And, uh...

04:35.776 --> 04:36.977
I would imagine that the victim

04:37.010 --> 04:39.813
has sustained fractures
of several limbs.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.881
( camera shutter clicking )

04:40.914 --> 04:42.616
Cause of death?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.051
Impossible to say

04:44.084 --> 04:45.853
till we get him back,
but, uh,

04:45.886 --> 04:47.421
from the looks
of this head wound...

04:47.455 --> 04:48.922
( camera shutter clicking )

04:48.956 --> 04:50.858
...I would say that
he probably struck a rock.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.893
Cause of death.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.529
Shock.

04:55.563 --> 04:58.366
That would be my
supposition as well.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.868
What I don't get is

05:00.901 --> 05:02.069
the flesh trauma.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.438
What kind of wounds
are these, Doctor?

05:04.472 --> 05:07.908
DUCKY:
They're coyote-- he would eat
the exposed tissue first.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.478
What's second?

05:10.511 --> 05:13.381
Well, if what I suspect
is true...

05:13.414 --> 05:17.451
Here, the abdominal cavity
has been chewed open.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.786
You know, the liver
and kidney

05:18.819 --> 05:21.389
is a rich source of nutrients
for these creatures.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.857
That's, uh, gross, Doctor.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.427
Well, actually, Mr. Palmer,
we're quite lucky here.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.095
In some cases,
they chew off the head

05:28.128 --> 05:30.964
and carry it away,
so they won't have to fight

05:30.998 --> 05:32.566
other coyotes for it.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.801
My coroner friend

05:33.834 --> 05:36.704
in Los Angeles says coyotes
"take it to go."

05:36.737 --> 05:38.138
( chuckles )

05:38.171 --> 05:39.907
They're very strange

05:39.940 --> 05:41.709
in Los Angeles.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.144
Anything unusual, Duck?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.345
No, not really, Jethro.

05:45.379 --> 05:48.716
I'll know more when I get
our Marine back on the table.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.150
Boss!

05:50.183 --> 05:52.886
Found the camcorder!

05:55.022 --> 05:56.657
( camera shutter clicking )

05:56.690 --> 05:59.893
He was obsessed
with the stupid camera.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.563
I gave it to him
on his birthday.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.933
Maybe if he hadn't been filming
he wouldn't have slipped.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.134
Anybody else
at this campsite

06:07.167 --> 06:08.836
while you were here?
No, sir,

06:08.869 --> 06:09.670
just the drunk.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.639
Aw, he was nothing
to worry about.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.773
He was in a trailer

06:12.806 --> 06:13.874
over there.

06:13.907 --> 06:14.675
Scruffy guy.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.077
He was drinking
too much, got loud.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.779
We asked him to keep it down.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.949
He didn't keep it down?
No, sir.

06:21.982 --> 06:22.783
So we went over there,

06:22.816 --> 06:24.918
tried to reason with
him-- that's when

06:24.952 --> 06:25.986
he took a swing.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.621
And you took a swing back.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.622
No, ma'am.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.923
Bill put him
in a headlock

06:29.957 --> 06:31.124
till he calmed down.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.126
And then he just took off.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.829
Don't suppose you got
a license number?
No point, sir.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.165
The guy was harmless.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.701
WOMAN:
Bill spends eight months
in Iraq,

06:40.734 --> 06:44.071
and he dies filming a sunrise
in Virginia.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.173
ABBY:
That's not the way
it works, Gibbs.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.108
This thing has been
in water for hours.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.010
You don't just spray
a little 409

06:50.043 --> 06:51.479
on the tape
and off you go.
Tape?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.046
Yeah, it's digital videotape.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.748
I thought everything
was a chip these days.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.016
No. They kind of
married the old school

06:56.049 --> 06:57.951
with the new.
You know how, like,

06:57.985 --> 06:58.952
new hip-hop artists will go back

06:58.986 --> 07:01.589
to old-school rappers
like Sugar Hill Gang?

07:01.622 --> 07:04.091
How long?
I have to separate
the cartridge,

07:04.124 --> 07:06.760
I have to submerge
the wheels in a
cleaning solution

07:06.794 --> 07:08.028
with the heads up against it,

07:08.061 --> 07:09.597
I have to remove
the silt contaminants

07:09.630 --> 07:11.765
so they don't
shred the tape...
How long, Abby?

07:11.799 --> 07:15.002
Um... three, maybe four hours.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.239
Let me know when you got it.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.641
Hey, Gibbs.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.209
Do you have
a camcorder?

07:22.242 --> 07:24.244
Yeah.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.046
Digital. Okay?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.715
Good, Gibbs! Way to go!

07:27.748 --> 07:29.950
Did you make the jump
to CDs yet?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.052
'Cause if you didn't,
it's cool.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.721
'Cause all the hot deejays,

07:33.754 --> 07:35.623
they use vinyl these days,
anyway.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.659
Just get it to me.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.729
Hey, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

07:41.762 --> 07:43.163
Peace out, man.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.000
( beeping )

07:47.034 --> 07:51.104
Indiscriminate predators,
coyotes.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.507
Fish, cats, garbage.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.743
They'll eat anything
they can chew.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.879
Unlike my mother,
who can no longer chew anything.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.147
I assure you,

08:00.180 --> 08:02.516
Mr. Palmer, it is
a beastly sight.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.184
Yes, it is, Doctor.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.987
I was speaking of my mother.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.889
Right.

08:08.922 --> 08:09.957
Have you ever seen

08:09.990 --> 08:13.026
a rib-eye steak that's
been reduced to baby food

08:13.060 --> 08:14.161
by a Cuisinart?

08:14.194 --> 08:15.996
Not recently.
Uh...

08:16.029 --> 08:18.098
It's remarkably similar
to her...

08:18.131 --> 08:20.901
burritos and her pizzas.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.804
Not to mention
the Sunday dinner treat:

08:23.837 --> 08:25.873
sushi through a straw.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.875
Give me a pair of tweezers,
Mr. Palmer.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.744
There's something
peculiar here.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.546
What is it, Doctor?

08:32.580 --> 08:33.547
I haven't a clue.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.116
That's why you will take it
directly up to Abby.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.921
I was thinking, Mr. Palmer...

08:40.954 --> 08:42.022
Yes, Doctor?

08:42.055 --> 08:43.891
Perhaps it's about time
you came over

08:43.924 --> 08:45.158
to the house one evening.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.594
Came over?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.696
Join us for dinner.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.665
Uh, that...

08:51.699 --> 08:53.166
that would be great.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.059
ABBY:
Northern white ash.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.829
Ash trees are not indigenous
to this area,

09:21.862 --> 09:23.130
and even if they were,

09:23.163 --> 09:25.833
you know of any that have
kiln-dried wood?

09:25.866 --> 09:28.001
And a lacquer coating?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.870
Lacquer?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.204
Yep. Clear coat.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.809
Baseball bat.

09:35.843 --> 09:36.710
( clicks tongue )

09:37.778 --> 09:40.681
Wooden bats are made
out of either maple or ash.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.084
Ash is more popular, but it
tends to splinter more easily.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.186
Especially when they
come in contact with
somebody's skull.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.155
Somebody did a Barry Bonds

09:48.188 --> 09:51.124
on Sergeant Moore's
head, Gibbs.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.696
KATE:
Sergeant William Moore,

09:55.729 --> 09:58.198
transfer from Camp Lejeune
to Quantico two months ago.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.166
He was serving as an E.I.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.735
for all newly-commissioned
Marine officers.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.337
E.I.?
Enlisted Instructor,
Probie.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.273
Uh, what did
he teach, Kate?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.776
Well, according to his
records, uh, MOUT.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.711
MOUT stands for
Military Operation...

10:10.744 --> 10:12.713
Yes, I know what
it stands for, Tony.

10:12.746 --> 10:16.283
Well, excuse me for trying
to help junior agents.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.118
Trust me, when I,
uh, need help,

10:18.151 --> 10:20.688
you will be
the first person I ask...

10:20.721 --> 10:22.222
where Gibbs or Kate is.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.791
( fake laugh )
KATE:
You two done?

10:23.824 --> 10:24.892
For the moment.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.727
These...

10:26.760 --> 10:29.229
are the last two people
to have seen our Sergeant alive.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.298
His best friend and his wife.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.233
Hey!

10:33.266 --> 10:34.167
Now I'm done.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.368
Continue.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.706
Do you think that
one or both of them

10:38.739 --> 10:40.107
could have murdered
the Sergeant?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.043
Well, it is kind of weird
a single guy

10:43.076 --> 10:45.178
hanging out with
a married couple.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.279
I agree.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.715
Why is that?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.817
Well, because he's a single guy

10:49.850 --> 10:52.052
hanging out
with married people.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.721
I do that all the time.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.188
Yeah, but you bring
a date, right?

10:55.222 --> 10:57.324
Not... always.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.159
Are you related to them?

10:59.192 --> 11:00.293
No.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.232
What?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.334
Well, who...
usually invites you?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.202
The man or the woman?

11:09.236 --> 11:10.704
I don't know.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.807
I guess usually the guy.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.945
Okay, a lot of my
friends are from

11:17.978 --> 11:20.213
the Secret Service,
and most of them

11:20.247 --> 11:22.716
happen to be men.
What about your, um,

11:22.750 --> 11:24.484
your girlfriend
who called yesterday morning?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.219
Well... Deb is married

11:26.253 --> 11:28.221
to one of my buddies, Rick.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.189
( stifled laughter )

11:29.222 --> 11:33.293
Okay, so what you're
trying to say is that

11:33.326 --> 11:35.495
all of my married
male friends

11:35.528 --> 11:37.397
secretly want
to sleep with me.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.066
Pretty much, yeah.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.300
That's very mature, Tony.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.736
And for your information,
men and women

11:42.770 --> 11:45.105
can just be friends.
Right, McGee?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.406
Technically.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.742
What do you mean,
"technically"?

11:48.776 --> 11:51.178
He means she'd have to be
pretty ugly first.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.380
Wait, I-I didn't
say that.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.282
I swear, I do not
get paid enough

11:55.315 --> 11:57.150
for this.
For what, Kate?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.118
Uh, nothing.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.287
We are just discussing
potential suspects.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.956
Focusing on the Sergeant's
wife and best friend, boss.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.859
Yeah, well, come on,
we got one more.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.394
( stifled laughter )

12:09.162 --> 12:11.865
You guys are four years old.
Honestly.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.248
Um, nice hat.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.150
Attractive.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.184
In a weird way.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.887
Why?

12:33.921 --> 12:36.857
Well, I had to set up a clean
room in the ballistics lab

12:36.890 --> 12:38.291
to work
with the damaged videotape,

12:38.325 --> 12:41.394
and just throwing the caps
away seemed sort of wasteful

12:41.428 --> 12:43.363
so I decided to recycle.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.364
What do you think?

12:44.397 --> 12:47.000
I think it suits you.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.436
Now, what's on the tape?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.371
Well, I haven't finished
cleaning it up yet,

12:51.404 --> 12:53.206
but I have a P.O.I.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.341
"Person of Interest."

12:54.374 --> 12:55.175
GIBBS:
Let's see it.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.576
ABBY:
The following program has

12:56.609 --> 12:58.211
been edited for time
and content.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.880
It may not be appropriate
for younger viewers.

12:59.913 --> 13:00.881
Do not touch me.
Abby.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.015
Right.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.318
( music playing )

13:05.352 --> 13:06.820
This isn't a good idea, Bill.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.355
But I've asked this
guy three times

13:08.388 --> 13:09.522
to turn his
music down.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.926
Yeah. Now, we make him.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.295
And if he has a gun
or something in there?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.497
I film it and we get
the redneck arrested.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.100
( man laughing )

13:20.133 --> 13:21.468
Way to encourage him, Roger.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.602
Oh, come on, honey.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.504
It's not that
big of a deal.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.738
We'll be right back.

13:25.772 --> 13:30.243
Okay, this next part is like
an outtake from Deliverance.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.146
I thought I told you guys
to leave me the hell alone.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.315
Sir, we will,
once you turn the music down.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.483
What? You think

13:36.516 --> 13:39.186
I'm afraid of
you or something?

13:39.219 --> 13:41.088
Sir, I'm not
here to fight you.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.323
We just want you
to lower the music.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.192
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.326
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

13:46.359 --> 13:48.395
Why don't you just forget it,

13:48.428 --> 13:51.331
'cause you just assaulted
me on camera, huh? See?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.500
Either you leave, or we're
going to call the cops.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.335
All right. All right,
just let me go. Huh?

13:55.368 --> 13:56.836
Let me... All right.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.373
We need to ID this guy.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.009
Oh, I'm way ahead of you, Gibbs.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.110
I got a shot
of the license plate.

14:03.143 --> 14:07.414
It is registered to a David
Runion. His last address

14:07.447 --> 14:09.349
is an RV campground
in Manassas.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.350
He's since moved.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.351
Find him.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.020
That's good work, Abby.

14:13.053 --> 14:13.921
Tony, head back

14:13.954 --> 14:15.555
to Shenandoah State Park.
Take McGee.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.523
For what exactly, boss?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.358
I want to know where
the Sergeant was killed

14:18.391 --> 14:20.027
before he was
tossed off that cliff.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.028
Oh.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.396
Get the sedan ready, Probie.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.432
I'll meet you out front.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.967
So Kate,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.401
you really like my hat?

14:28.435 --> 14:30.470
Uh... it's different.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.605
Cool, because I
made you one.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.646
Oh... Abby, I-I,
I don't know what to say.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.281
Put it on.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.317
Okay.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.495
She bet me 20 bucks
that she could

14:55.528 --> 14:56.529
make you wear that today.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.537
Your cut.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.706
Pleasure doing business
with you, Abs.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.142
Totally.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.278
Hurry it up, McGee.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.279
You could have helped.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.281
I did. I carried
the camera.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.116
Moore was a Marine,
a combat veteran,

15:16.149 --> 15:17.350
probably not the easiest

15:17.384 --> 15:18.952
guy in the world
to sneak up on.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.420
Unless he knew
his attacker.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.421
Or was ambushed.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.223
It's a pretty
wide-open space.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.691
Let's check out
the tree line.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.427
Blood drop.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.628
Sure looks like it.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.397
Okay, we're
gonna have

15:30.430 --> 15:31.431
to search in there.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.565
You're gonna want

15:32.599 --> 15:33.700
to watch out for...
Yes, I know

15:33.733 --> 15:35.368
how to search a
wooded area, Tony.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.369
I'm not an idiot.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.304
Didn't say you were.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.106
Then why do you always
treat me like one?

15:39.139 --> 15:42.242
Just trying to impart
a little wisdom, McGee.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.245
Look, I graduated top
of my class at FLETC.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.546
So, I think I can handle it.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.414
Be my guest.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.516
Give me a call me
if you find anything.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.483
I will.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.655
Found David Runion, Gibbs.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.390
Checked into
another campground

15:57.424 --> 15:59.192
20 miles from
Shenandoah State Park.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.328
Also ran a background
check on him.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.329
He's served time.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.330
For what?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.464
Assault and battery.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.299
He nearly beat
a man to death

16:06.333 --> 16:07.334
with a pool cue in '93.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.602
Looks like this time he
might have succeeded.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.403
We getting a warrant?

16:10.437 --> 16:12.405
We need evidence for
a warrant, Kate.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.641
Right now I just want
to talk to him.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.492
Tony!

16:32.525 --> 16:34.494
Found it!

16:35.795 --> 16:37.564
Not bad.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.366
Not bad at all, McGee.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.667
Thanks. Hey, I'm,

16:40.700 --> 16:43.136
I'm sorry about back there.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.704
Don't mention it.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.540
Besides, that was
a pretty brave thing to do.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.042
What do you mean, brave?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.077
Well...

16:50.110 --> 16:51.411
crawling around back here

16:51.444 --> 16:53.446
in all this poison ivy.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.714
I don't know if
I would have done it.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.484
You, you're kidding, right?

16:57.517 --> 17:02.089
"Leaves of three,
let them be," McGee.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.258
A little something
I picked up

17:05.292 --> 17:06.259
during my first year.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.095
Don't touch me, by the way.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.068
Is that a rat

17:15.102 --> 17:16.269
or a dog?

17:16.303 --> 17:17.570
Hey, buddy.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.139
Hi.

17:19.172 --> 17:19.572
( growling )

17:19.606 --> 17:21.541
Oh! Sorry.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.510
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you, Gibbs.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.218
One day you're going to have
to tell me how you do that.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.087
Easy.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.123
They can sense sarcasm.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.196
( growling )

17:43.863 --> 17:45.398
( barking )

17:48.635 --> 17:50.437
Runion!
( knocking )

17:50.470 --> 17:52.105
Special Agents
Gibbs and Todd,

17:52.139 --> 17:53.440
NCIS!

17:53.473 --> 17:56.143
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.698
Clear.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.668
What do you think?

18:21.701 --> 18:23.636
The word "disgusting"
comes to mind.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.637
You smell that?

18:24.671 --> 18:26.606
If you're referring
to the urine?

18:26.639 --> 18:27.607
Yes.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.142
No, I meant this.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.678
Marijuana?

18:31.711 --> 18:34.314
Yeah, it's recent, too.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.785
Ah.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.355
Well, it's enough
to bring him in

18:42.389 --> 18:43.790
and hold him for a while.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.824
Oh, yeah.

18:44.857 --> 18:45.858
( dog barking )

18:50.263 --> 18:51.398
Runion!

18:51.431 --> 18:52.665
Federal agents! Stop!

19:12.752 --> 19:13.720
Idiots.

19:13.753 --> 19:14.721
( hammer clicking )

19:14.754 --> 19:16.356
Put your hands
behind your head.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.726
How did you...?

19:19.759 --> 19:20.660
Sneak up on you like that?

19:20.693 --> 19:21.861
Yeah.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.596
Used to do it
for a living.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.699
Back then you'd be dead
instead of under arrest.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.437
Any other questions?

19:30.470 --> 19:31.604
Uh-uh.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.573
Didn't think so.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.415
I know you can
hear me out there.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.419
I'm telling you
for the last time.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.420
I gotta use the bathroom.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.890
Okay, have
it your way.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.360
Won't be the first time
I had to do this.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.295
Maybe we should.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.363
He's bluffing.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.430
Tony, you didn't see

19:57.464 --> 19:58.565
the inside
of his camper.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.334
That bad, huh?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.669
Picture the
most disgusting

20:02.702 --> 20:04.804
public restroom
you've ever been in,

20:04.837 --> 20:06.806
covered in puss
and vomit.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.541
I would still
rather live there

20:08.575 --> 20:11.010
than this guy's place.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.412
That's nice, Kate.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.014
You should thank me.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.516
Eating that crap
will kill you.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.418
I'm more concerned
about what Gibbs'll do

20:18.451 --> 20:20.920
if this redneck takes one
in our interrogation room.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.458
I got, I got to use a bathroom.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.559
Hold it.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.760
I can't!

20:27.794 --> 20:29.562
Good, we can
do this quick.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.930
Why'd you murder

20:30.963 --> 20:32.932
Sergeant William Moore?

20:32.965 --> 20:34.033
What?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.035
Who the hell is that?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.870
That's right, you probably

20:37.904 --> 20:39.272
don't recall his name.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.451
WILLIAM:
Sir, I'm not here to fight you.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.786
We just want you
to lower the mus...

20:53.820 --> 20:55.655
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.856
Hey, hey.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.525
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

20:58.558 --> 21:01.528
Why don't you just forget it,
'cause you just assaulted...

21:10.570 --> 21:14.441
He was found yesterday lying
at the bottom of a cliff.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.646
Is that what this is all about?

21:19.679 --> 21:21.681
You think I killed some jarhead?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.516
No way, man.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.584
Nice try.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.652
Why'd you run?

21:25.685 --> 21:27.854
'Cause of the pot
in my trailer.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.557
I got a medical condition.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.659
What? Stupidity?

21:32.692 --> 21:35.762
Oh, look, man,
I was really drunk that night.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.631
I barely remember the guy.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.434
I sure as hell didn't kill him.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.503
Where were you
yesterday between

21:43.536 --> 21:45.772
5:30 and 7:30 a.m.?

21:45.805 --> 21:47.740
Sleeping?

21:47.774 --> 21:51.578
Yeah. At the rest stop off 211.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.946
I didn't even wake up
until after 10:00.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.348
Witnesses?

21:55.382 --> 21:56.849
Well, sure.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.017
I mean, there were lots

21:58.050 --> 22:00.119
of other cars and trucks
when I pulled in.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.654
I need names.

22:01.688 --> 22:05.392
I don't have any names.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.801
There are two rest stops
on that road, Tony.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.504
Check if they have any video
surveillance or attendants.

22:17.537 --> 22:18.037
On it.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.408
DiNOZZO:
Running it, Boss.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.809
So what happens now?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.811
You've got a violent past,
your alibi is weak,

22:24.844 --> 22:27.480
and I've got you on tape
threatening the victim.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.016
You tell me, Runion.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.484
Oh, man, my whole life

22:31.518 --> 22:34.020
it's always been like this.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.389
One freaking
nightmare after another,

22:36.423 --> 22:39.726
but I, I swear
to you, Agent Gibbs...

22:39.759 --> 22:42.862
I didn't kill anybody.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.602
We found your bat.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.070
( gulps )

22:51.103 --> 22:52.605
What bat?

22:59.646 --> 23:03.015
Hey, Abby. Got something?

23:03.049 --> 23:05.652
I got good news
and bad news.

23:05.685 --> 23:06.786
This is definitely our bat.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.889
The splinter from
Sergeant Moore's
head fits perfectly.

23:09.922 --> 23:10.890
Bad news?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.191
It's been wiped clean

23:12.224 --> 23:13.560
of any prints.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.727
The only thing on it
is urushiol oil.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.096
That's the stuff found in...

23:17.129 --> 23:18.164
( gasps )

23:18.197 --> 23:19.499
What?

23:19.532 --> 23:22.134
You...

23:22.168 --> 23:24.136
you have to see this
for yourself.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.580
Whoa.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.182
This is going to hurt, isn't it?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.149
Yes.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.986
I'll look like a circus freak!

23:40.019 --> 23:41.721
Tell me, what do I do?

23:41.754 --> 23:45.692
Um, well... you could use
Calamine lotion.

23:45.725 --> 23:49.061
Or... perhaps just wear
some sort of mask.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.667
And can you mark it
"Special Agent Todd"?

23:54.701 --> 23:56.068
Thanks, Sheriff Lester.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.939
Dinner?

23:59.972 --> 24:02.642
Aren't you married?

24:02.675 --> 24:04.711
Well, it does to me.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.115
My mother wonders
why I'm not married.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.983
So does mine.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.585
Could you stop doing that?

24:12.619 --> 24:14.487
I'm practicing, Kate.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.022
What? Annoying me?

24:16.055 --> 24:17.857
No, the creepy way
Gibbs used to sneak up on us.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.526
What do you mean "used to"?

24:19.559 --> 24:20.527
The old man's
been wearing

24:20.560 --> 24:21.360
Ben-Gay lately.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.462
I can smell him
coming a mile away.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.699
That a fact,
DiNozzo?

24:26.733 --> 24:28.768
Knee feeling better, boss?

24:30.737 --> 24:31.804
Much.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.905
Great.

24:34.774 --> 24:35.875
What about Runion's alibi?

24:35.908 --> 24:39.278
I've got the local Sheriff
pulling the security tapes

24:39.311 --> 24:41.948
from the rest stops
on Route 211.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.684
And we have a description
of his pickup and trailer

24:44.717 --> 24:46.586
circulating with the state cops

24:46.619 --> 24:47.854
who worked the area
that night.

24:47.887 --> 24:48.755
Do you think
he did it, Gibbs?

24:48.788 --> 24:50.256
Oh, yeah.

24:50.289 --> 24:53.693
And Tony is
cleaning it up.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.095
Janitorial?
MAN:
Yes, sir.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.530
Don't worry
about Interrogation.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.600
DiNozzo's gonna handle it.

25:00.633 --> 25:01.634
( sighs )

25:01.668 --> 25:02.635
Oh...

25:03.770 --> 25:04.771
You still here?

25:04.804 --> 25:06.238
Are you serious?

25:07.206 --> 25:09.576
( laughing ):
You're serious?

25:10.977 --> 25:12.244
Oh...

25:12.278 --> 25:15.615
In my defense,
I did use the word "creepy"

25:15.648 --> 25:17.950
in the most... affectionate way.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.020
Right.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.655
You might want to use gloves.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.991
Where's McGee?

25:25.024 --> 25:29.929
Well, let's see what we're
dealing with here, Timothy.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.598
Ah, the dreaded

25:31.631 --> 25:33.766
Toxicodendron radicans--

25:34.867 --> 25:36.736
the poison ivy plant.

25:36.769 --> 25:37.770
You seem to be

25:37.804 --> 25:39.606
particularly allergic
to it.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.140
Usually it takes
several days

25:41.173 --> 25:43.075
for this sort of reaction
to develop.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.744
I'm lucky that way.

25:44.777 --> 25:49.315
The last time I encountered
a case of this magnitude,

25:49.348 --> 25:53.252
two young lovers fell asleep
naked in a field of it.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.854
Ah!

25:54.887 --> 25:57.724
I don't think Sarah has ever
forgiven me for that one.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.191
What I don't understand

25:59.225 --> 26:01.761
is how did I get it
all over my face?

26:01.794 --> 26:04.731
It's the urushiol oil
in the plant.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.900
Yes. Once it gets
on your hands,

26:07.934 --> 26:09.335
it spreads by contact.

26:09.368 --> 26:13.272
Um, then I have
a major problem, Ducky.

26:13.305 --> 26:17.276
When I was out there,
I, um, I had to,

26:17.309 --> 26:18.611
you know...?

26:18.645 --> 26:19.779
No, I don't.

26:19.812 --> 26:20.813
Relieve myself.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.148
Oh.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.318
Oh...

26:26.352 --> 26:30.089
Well, uh... let's take
a look, then.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.894
This is, uh,
this is kind of embarrassing.

26:34.927 --> 26:35.728
I'm a doctor, McGee.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.897
I have seen everything
there is to see

26:37.930 --> 26:39.732
more times than I care
to remember.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.102
Good Lord.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.337
What? Is it bad?!

26:45.371 --> 26:47.874
No, no, it's fine, fine.

26:47.907 --> 26:48.875
Nothing to worry about.

26:48.908 --> 26:52.278
I didn't expect to see...

26:52.311 --> 26:54.747
quite so much swelling.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.049
If Tony finds out about this,
I'm going to have to quit.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.051
Well, your secret
is safe with me.

26:59.085 --> 27:02.021
Doctor, I've got the new
inspection forms you reque....

27:06.225 --> 27:08.127
I'll come back.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.799
Him I'm not so sure about.

27:14.901 --> 27:17.136
KATE:
Runion's trailer pulled
into the rest stop

27:17.169 --> 27:19.839
around 1:00 a.m.
that morning, Gibbs.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.441
A little image enhancement.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.776
TONY:
Runion.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.111
I can almost smell him
from here.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.445
How long did he stay?

27:26.478 --> 27:28.848
All night.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.085
Distance from Shenandoah River
State Park?

27:33.119 --> 27:35.988
It's about two miles, boss.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.757
I guess he was
telling the truth.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.926
We're going to have
to find a new suspect.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.728
( phone rings )
Yeah. Gibbs.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.963
( Abby speaking indistinctly )

27:43.996 --> 27:44.931
Maybe not. Come on.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.938
How you feeling?

27:51.971 --> 27:53.973
Like an idiot.
Tony tried to warn me.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.208
I didn't listen.
Aw, don't feel bad.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.043
The same thing happened

27:57.076 --> 27:58.745
to him the first year
he was here.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.046
Really?

28:00.079 --> 28:03.916
Not quite as
spectacularly, but yeah.

28:03.950 --> 28:04.851
Hmm...

28:04.884 --> 28:08.955
So, honestly, how do I look?

28:08.988 --> 28:11.791
Um...

28:11.824 --> 28:13.926
do you want the
truth, or do you
want me to lie to you

28:13.960 --> 28:17.830
to ease the burden
of your own self-loathing?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.065
I'd prefer the lie.

28:19.098 --> 28:19.899
Me, too.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.969
You're the fairest
in the land, McGee.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.004
GIBBS:
Okay, what do you got
for me, Ab...?

28:29.075 --> 28:31.443
It-it looks worse than it is.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.979
I'm not so sure about that.
She means

28:33.012 --> 28:34.213
you look like
the elephant man, Probie.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.915
Tony!
It's true.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.950
Can you still work, McGee?

28:37.984 --> 28:40.452
Yeah. Sure, Boss.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.859
Okay.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.327
What do you got
for me, Abby?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.997
Um, I cleaned up more of the
Sergeant's videotape.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.131
I need to see
the last thing he shot.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.299
Ooh, unfortunately, that's

28:53.332 --> 28:54.300
the part that received

28:54.333 --> 28:55.935
the most damage
from the impact.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.837
It was in contact with
the heads and a lot

28:57.870 --> 28:58.971
of the data got...
When?

28:59.005 --> 29:00.372
Um, I sent it
to the Naval photo lab.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.474
I'm hopefully going to
have it back by tomorrow.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.144
Well, what am I
doing here, Abby?

29:05.177 --> 29:07.780
Because of this.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.350
This is from the beginning
of the tape.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.384
It's mostly them
setting up camp,

29:12.418 --> 29:14.553
and checking out the area.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.957
And then there is this.

29:21.027 --> 29:24.296
TONY:
Looks like the widow
and the best friend

29:24.330 --> 29:26.999
don't know
they're being videotaped.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.406
ABBY:
And on the next shot...

29:34.440 --> 29:36.108
Honey, what's wrong?

29:41.047 --> 29:44.150
You still think men
and women can just
be friends, Kate?

29:58.064 --> 29:59.999
ABBY:
I just... I can't
be sure, Gibbs.

30:00.032 --> 30:00.900
According to Gloria,

30:00.933 --> 30:02.902
lip-reading
was never my strong suit.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.403
Gloria her deaf sister?

30:04.436 --> 30:05.537
Mm-hmm. Mother.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.040
I think Judy Moore's

30:08.074 --> 30:10.142
saying "We have to..."
something.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.177
Blank... "him."

30:11.210 --> 30:12.578
"Kill?"
No.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.980
"Murder?"
Nope.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.282
"Love?"
No.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.150
Really wish you'd stop
doing that.

30:18.184 --> 30:22.288
I will, Tony,
once you stop
"blanking" up.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.224
Okay, Abby, could you pull
the video back wider?

30:25.257 --> 30:26.893
You see how
she's touching
his face?

30:26.926 --> 30:29.028
It's very intimate.
Clearly there's more

30:29.061 --> 30:30.529
than a friendship going on here.

30:30.562 --> 30:34.200
Which just goes
to prove my point
about the sexes, Kate.

30:34.233 --> 30:37.336
DiNozzo, you pick up
Sergeant Caine in the morning.

30:37.369 --> 30:40.306
Kate, you pick up Judy Moore.
Don't tell her why.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.174
Looks like we're
going to play Gibbs'
favorite game.

30:42.208 --> 30:45.344
Musical Interrogation Rooms.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.915
People are staring at me.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.150
Of course. You're hideously
disfigured, Probie.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.485
If you listened to me, you
wouldn't be in this mess.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.386
If I listened
to you,

30:54.420 --> 30:57.256
Gibbs would have fired me
six months ago.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.258
You were going
to whack me,

30:59.291 --> 31:01.093
but you stopped. Why?

31:01.127 --> 31:02.628
I remember
what it was like
being the new guy;

31:02.661 --> 31:04.296
trying to fit in,
never make mistakes.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.264
And of course, the obvious.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.465
You like me?

31:06.498 --> 31:09.301
No, it would be like
touching a leper.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.974
Ladies and gentlemen,
this way, please.

31:15.007 --> 31:18.077
My favorite part of the tour.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.279
The Marine Corps sniper.

31:20.312 --> 31:23.115
One of the most feared
warriors in the world.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.184
After a brief demonstration,

31:25.217 --> 31:28.020
Corporal Cameron will be happy

31:28.054 --> 31:30.056
to answer any questions
you may have.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.624
I'll meet you by the command
center when he's done.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.194
Ladies and gentlemen,
you'll notice that...

31:35.227 --> 31:36.562
CAINE:
Any more information

31:36.595 --> 31:38.630
about Sergeant Moore's
accident, sir?

31:38.664 --> 31:40.632
Sure, except
it wasn't an accident.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.268
It was murder,
Sergeant Caine.

31:42.301 --> 31:46.372
Murder? How?

31:46.405 --> 31:47.406
Baseball bat to the head.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.674
50-foot fall
from a cliff.

31:48.707 --> 31:49.808
Coyotes probably didn't help.

31:49.841 --> 31:52.644
That redneck must have overheard
Bill saying he was going

31:52.678 --> 31:54.146
to film up there
in the morning.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.247
We got to find him.

31:55.281 --> 31:56.248
We did.

31:56.282 --> 31:57.283
You need me
to ID him?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.318
Nope.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.419
We do want to know
what happened

32:00.452 --> 32:01.653
when Sergeant Moore found out

32:01.687 --> 32:03.355
you were sleeping
with his wife.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.524
She told you that?

32:05.557 --> 32:07.359
No,

32:07.393 --> 32:08.427
he did.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.230
( phone beeps )

32:13.399 --> 32:15.434
Didn't know he
was videotaping
you, did you?

32:19.271 --> 32:20.372
It's not what you think.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.042
Oh, so you weren't
sleeping with her?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.549
You're under arrest,
Sergeant.

32:30.582 --> 32:31.150
For what?

32:31.183 --> 32:33.285
We'll start with adultery

32:33.319 --> 32:35.321
and work our way up
from there.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.189
I don't mean to be rude,
but couldn't you have

32:37.223 --> 32:40.026
just sent me my husband's
personal effects, Agent Todd?

32:40.059 --> 32:43.429
Well, normally we would have,
but that camera you bought him

32:43.462 --> 32:45.097
is pretty expensive.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.432
It, it still works?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.399
Yeah, in a way.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.169
Water?

32:50.202 --> 32:51.170
Thank you.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.404
So, Mrs. Moore,

32:52.438 --> 32:54.073
tell us about your husband.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.541
What kind of a man was he?

32:55.574 --> 32:58.310
Loving... gentle.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.711
What about jealous?

33:01.047 --> 33:02.281
Where do you want him, boss?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.415
Interrogation One.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.486
Roger?
Judy, what the hell
did you tell them?

33:07.519 --> 33:09.521
No talking, Marine!
What is going
on here?

33:09.555 --> 33:11.257
That's what you're going
to tell me,

33:11.290 --> 33:12.358
Mrs. Moore.
( phone rings )

33:12.391 --> 33:14.326
Take her
to Interrogation Room Two.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.065
Yeah. Gibbs.
( Abby speaks over phone )

33:19.098 --> 33:21.267
I'll read you
your rights
on the way.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.401
Did you get the last shot
from my tape?

33:22.434 --> 33:25.137
I'm just working
on it now, Gibbs.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.339
It's kind of like
a nature documentary,

33:27.373 --> 33:28.474
but with a riveting

33:28.507 --> 33:29.641
murder mystery subplot.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.577
This is where it
gets interesting.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.713
( William grunts )

33:40.519 --> 33:42.754
He slipped and fell?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.290
In the original version.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.291
But this movie

33:45.324 --> 33:46.458
comes with an
alternate ending--

33:46.492 --> 33:49.661
in slo-mo-- right when the
camera slams to the ground.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.066
The killer
recorded over it.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.734
The impact caused
the heads to lose
contact with

33:55.767 --> 33:58.337
the tape, preserving two frames
from the original recording.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.471
I've been working
on cleaning them up.

33:59.505 --> 34:00.672
Any way to recover the rest?

34:00.706 --> 34:03.142
Well, since all recordings
leave a magnetic impression--

34:03.175 --> 34:05.311
much like a computer hard drive,
by the way--

34:05.344 --> 34:07.613
if I scan the data, then
I'll be able to separate out...

34:07.646 --> 34:08.747
When?

34:08.780 --> 34:11.483
You don't have
to take the fun out

34:11.517 --> 34:12.351
of everything,
Gibbs.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.619
A few hours.

34:13.652 --> 34:14.686
Good job, Abby.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.489
You have 20 minutes.
Gibbs...

34:17.523 --> 34:19.458
Get McGee
to help you.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.466
As disturbing
as this sounds,

34:27.499 --> 34:31.370
I think you may have a point
about the sexes, Tony.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.839
It's Biology 101.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.874
Would you say
I'm attractive?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.543
Sure.

34:37.576 --> 34:41.147
Then how come...
you've never...?

34:41.180 --> 34:42.548
I know you.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.391
Something wrong with
your arm, Sergeant?

34:52.424 --> 34:57.429
Picked up some poison ivy
in the field last week, sir.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.730
That a fact?

34:58.764 --> 35:01.400
I didn't murder anyone, sir.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.435
Yeah? Well, we'll get
to that part.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.172
How long were you and
Sergeant Moore friends?

35:06.205 --> 35:07.673
Since boot camp, sir.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.809
Parris Island or San Diego?

35:10.842 --> 35:12.778
San Diego, sir.

35:12.811 --> 35:16.748
Right. A Hollywood Marine.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.651
So how long

35:19.685 --> 35:21.620
after that did you start...
his wife?

35:22.688 --> 35:24.656
JUDY:
I don't understand,

35:24.690 --> 35:25.691
Agent Gibbs.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.493
Why am I in here?!

35:27.526 --> 35:28.760
Don't you want to know

35:28.794 --> 35:31.397
who murdered your
husband, Mrs. Moore?

35:31.430 --> 35:33.699
Yes. But I know
it wasn't Roger.

35:33.732 --> 35:34.866
He wouldn't.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.635
There's no way.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.337
Why is that?

35:39.338 --> 35:41.773
Because...

35:41.807 --> 35:44.576
he was with me
that morning.

35:44.610 --> 35:49.448
By "with me," you mean
in the same sleeping bag?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.450
CAINE:
She actually said that?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.585
No way, sir.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.887
Why would she lie?
I mean,

35:55.921 --> 35:59.425
besides protecting
you, Sergeant.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.327
She's insane.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.730
Look, right after
Sergeant Moore went to film

36:04.763 --> 36:07.466
the sunrise, I went down
to the campground showers.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.268
I was gone
for about an hour.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.702
So she was there
when you got back?

36:10.736 --> 36:12.704
Yes, sir.
She was making breakfast.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.206
So what you're saying

36:14.240 --> 36:16.442
is she had about
an hour to kill him.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.810
I... I didn't say that.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.512
My mistake. You're saying

36:20.546 --> 36:22.548
you had about an hour
to kill him.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.919
There's no way
Roger would say that.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.689
Agent Todd, play back.

36:30.722 --> 36:34.560
I almost feel sorry
for these two.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.863
GIBBS:
Why would she lie?

36:37.896 --> 36:39.331
CAINE:
She's insane.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.732
GIBBS:
So what you're saying is

36:40.766 --> 36:42.534
she had about an hour
to kill him.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.503
Let me guess.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.506
You thought he loved you.

36:50.576 --> 36:54.546
When Bill was in Iraq,

36:54.580 --> 36:55.881
Roger and I...

36:58.750 --> 37:01.019
( sobs )

37:01.052 --> 37:04.356
We grew close.

37:09.595 --> 37:12.030
What now, Boss?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.766
Put them both in the same room.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.669
Going to need a refill for this.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.644
CAINE:
We fooled around
a few times, Judy.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.413
It was a stupid mistake.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.581
You said you loved me.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.817
Are you nuts?
Bill was my best friend.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.685
It should never have happened.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.388
JUDY:
Then why did you kill him,
if it wasn't to be with me?

37:36.422 --> 37:38.657
Stop saying that,
you crazy...!

37:38.690 --> 37:39.991
I didn't kill him!

37:40.025 --> 37:41.627
She's making it up!

37:41.660 --> 37:42.861
I'm pregnant, Roger.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.730
It's yours.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.701
Oh, this is better than cable.

37:49.735 --> 37:53.004
Question is,
which one's telling the truth?

37:55.607 --> 37:58.644
Okay. Ready to try
again, McGee?

37:58.677 --> 38:00.446
Play it.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.714
WILLIAM:
Ah, that's beautiful.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.618
( William yells )

38:13.525 --> 38:14.360
Just need to adjust

38:14.393 --> 38:17.463
the read heads off track
a little more.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.730
Is that you, Roger?

38:18.764 --> 38:20.799
( William grunts in pain )

38:35.747 --> 38:37.649
Ha!
Ha.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.951
His trailer never left
the rest stop?

38:39.985 --> 38:41.086
But Runion did.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.721
Abby inverted
the image,

38:42.754 --> 38:44.490
and at 0900,
you can just make out

38:44.523 --> 38:46.858
his shadow underneath the
trailer as he's coming back.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.728
It's only a four-mile
round-trip on foot.

38:49.761 --> 38:50.762
Thanks, Sheriff.

38:50.796 --> 38:51.763
Runion posted bail

38:51.797 --> 38:53.399
for the pot charge
an hour ago.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.800
Let's roll.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.468
What about Sergeant Caine
and Mrs. Moore?

38:56.502 --> 38:57.469
Let 'em suffer
for a while.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.971
I think Sergeant Moore
would appreciate that.

39:01.940 --> 39:05.076
( crows cawing in distance )

39:08.714 --> 39:10.616
( barking )

39:10.649 --> 39:12.751
Get back in the truck,
you miserable little piece of...

39:14.720 --> 39:16.988
( dog barking )

39:26.732 --> 39:28.767
Put down your weapon, Runion!

39:28.800 --> 39:31.002
You're not getting
out of here alive!

39:37.809 --> 39:39.878
I ain't goin' back to prison,
Gibbs, you hear me?!

39:39.911 --> 39:42.013
I'd say we're outgunned, boss.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.081
I'll circle around back.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.617
I got a better idea.

39:45.651 --> 39:46.585
( whistles )

39:46.618 --> 39:48.554
Oh!
( growls )

39:50.622 --> 39:51.823
You might want
to cover your ears.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.869
( crows cawing in distance )

40:04.836 --> 40:06.838
I think you got him, boss.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.111
Well, what are we gonna do
with this thing?

40:14.713 --> 40:16.715
No... way, Gibbs.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.883
I'll take him.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.518
I always wanted a dog.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.752
( growls )

40:20.786 --> 40:22.454
( barks )
( laughs )

40:22.488 --> 40:24.222
Good dog!

40:24.255 --> 40:25.857
I think
I'll call you Tony.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.160
It's a bitch, Kate.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.796
I know.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.034
KATE:
Is it just me,

40:36.067 --> 40:37.703
or do you think
Tony likes me?

40:37.736 --> 40:40.005
ABBY:
I think it's more than
obvious Tony likes you.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.741
KATE:
Not my usual type,
but kind of cute.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.842
ABBY:
More like adorable.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.977
Maybe we could share Tony.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.846
( barking )

40:47.879 --> 40:48.914
What's wrong?

40:48.947 --> 40:49.981
KATE:
Aw, nothing.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.917
Good doggie.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.820
You can come out
now, DiNozzo.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.255
Yeah, no, I'll just, uh,
I'll take care of that. Thanks.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.924
Hey.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.058
Did you bring the dog food?

41:00.091 --> 41:01.593
Yeah, they didn't have
any bowls.

41:01.627 --> 41:02.260
( growls )
Hey there.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.095
( barks, growls )

41:04.129 --> 41:05.263
KATE:
That's okay.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.898
We got it covered.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.600
ABBY:
Got a present for you,

41:08.634 --> 41:09.735
little Tony.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.870
( gasps ):
Good idea!

41:11.903 --> 41:13.505
Now we can tell

41:13.539 --> 41:15.206
the two of them apart.
Well, at least I don't

41:15.240 --> 41:16.942
hang out with
married people, Kate.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.577
Oh, will you
please tell him

41:18.610 --> 41:20.846
that men and women
can just be friends?

41:20.879 --> 41:22.814
Absolutely they can.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.249
Without having sex?

41:24.282 --> 41:25.984
Oh, no, they'll have sex.

41:26.885 --> 41:27.886
Abby...

41:29.187 --> 41:31.056
What, Kate?
You never slept with a friend?

41:33.825 --> 41:35.861
What is wrong
with you people?

41:35.894 --> 41:36.862
GIBBS:
Good question, Kate.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.699
What'd you do to the dog?

41:40.732 --> 41:42.734
Just taking care of her.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.170
Unless you want to.

41:46.738 --> 41:47.906
ABBY:
Here you go, girl.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.142
KATE:
Wow!

41:51.176 --> 41:53.178
She even eats
like you, Tony.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.213
Has anybody seen
my ball cap?

41:55.246 --> 41:56.815
No.
No.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.283
'Cause I... I could've sworn

41:58.316 --> 42:00.518
I left it right on my desk.
