02:15.400 --> 02:19.951
The shaft's a bit longer on this one,
so just give it some room to breathe.

02:32.840 --> 02:33.909
Man down.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.796
Ah, Mark, whatever.
He can take a shot to the head.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.436
- Big Dog eats good.
- Sweet.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.120
Seriously, man. You've got more
natural talent than anyone I've ever seen.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.078
I mean, in a few years from now,
people are gonna be like,"Tiger who?"

02:48.160 --> 02:50.390
- Hey, guys.
- You got everything we need?

02:50.720 --> 02:53.154
I do. Your future is in my hands.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.358
Hey, excuse me.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.114
How would you like a PAHR T-shirt?

03:01.320 --> 03:04.949
Number one up-and-coming
golf apparel company in the U.S.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.509
Sure.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.189
Oh.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.795
Thanks.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.038
No, no, thank you.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.957
- How did you do that?
- That was pimp.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.234
Shit. I needed that shirt for the presentation.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.189
- Oh, is that today?
- We're headed over there right now.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.391
- Nice.
- We're gonna blow them away, all right?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.870
PAHR is up and running, making a profit.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.235
And we just stole Nike away
from Ash-Whole.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.271
- Seriously? Nice. All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.879
- Right on.
- Hey, wait a minute.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.518
E, don't you have English Lit?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.119
Uh...

03:48.360 --> 03:49.998
Yeah, sort of.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.516
- Had a little problem with his professor.
- What problem?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.589
He slept with her.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.631
You slept with Mrs Watley?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.279
- No.
- Now she keeps calling him.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.920
-"Eric, Eric."
- It wasn't my fault, though.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.351
We were in an elevator together
and there was porno music playing...

04:14.680 --> 04:16.079
Is that...

04:18.839 --> 04:19.829
I think so.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.555
You're my hero.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.552
Your old man is gonna kill you when
he finds out you've been ditching classes.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.030
Uh-uh. That's why we're gonna make sure
he doesn't find out.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.155
Besides, once I pull a Bobby Jones...

04:43.240 --> 04:44.992
...he's gonna forget all about it.
It won't even matter.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.550
Wait, an amateur is not gonna win
the US Open again.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.792
It's been 80 years.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.356
I think it's time. My time.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.232
Get out of the way.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.274
My time.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.078
Son of a...

05:06.400 --> 05:07.389
Oh, yeah!

05:08.040 --> 05:09.632
I do like this club. Can I keep this?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.549
- Hey, Sis.
- Hey, Ty.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.669
Hey, Eric.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.268
Hey, Mandy.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.437
I haven't seen you on campus much lately.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.754
Yeah, well, you know.
Too many beers need drinking.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.151
And too many girls that need loving.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.995
And night after night
I sit in my dorm all alone.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.309
Well, you know...

05:27.880 --> 05:29.950
I'm working my way over there.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.833
I need this for the presentation.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.229
Okay.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.638
- Come on, Jason, let's go. Go.
- But I was just hanging out...

05:38.720 --> 05:40.073
- Good luck.
- Later, man.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.708
See you, guys. Oh, hey, are you going
to the Delta Tau party tonight?

05:45.920 --> 05:46.909
What?

05:47.440 --> 05:49.795
Stay focused. I'll call you later.

05:50.000 --> 05:50.989
Where you going? Class?

05:51.240 --> 05:52.275
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.672
- Mind if I walk you?
- Sure.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.076
So, where is this party?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.239
I'm gonna take a shot in the dark.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.676
...and say that Ty doesn't want his little sister
at a frat party.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.796
He doesn't run my life.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.030
I'm 18 now, I can do what I want.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.479
- All right, well...
- You know I'll find out where it is anyway.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.439
He's gonna come after me with a five iron
if he finds out I'm the one who told you.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.791
Hold on a second. Sorry.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.069
Hey.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.988
Yo, E.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.635
I got a live one here.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.308
What's his handi?

06:26.360 --> 06:27.713
He thinks he's an eight.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.638
Yeah? And he's looking for some action?

06:29.720 --> 06:30.755
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.388
Get down here now, man.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.795
All right.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.631
I gotta jet. I got a fish on the hook.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.631
There's gotta be a better way
to make money.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.915
No, I gotta hustle every cent I can.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.309
Maybe I should just sell my body for sex.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.994
- In that case...
- No, no, no, no, no.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.833
Your money is no good here.
I'll toss you one on the house.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.956
Yeah. First taste is free,
after that it's gonna cost you.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.598
Oh, jeez.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.435
All right. Go to class, you.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.910
- See you at the party later?
- We'll see. We'll see.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.552
- He's good.
- Yeah.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.556
- He's real good.
- Yeah.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.353
You can't even tell that he's holding back.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.709
He's cocky enough to take us on?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.069
Oh, yeah.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.518
He'll take us both on.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.639
Perfect.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.669
Oh.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.878
You're gonna need an eagle to win, kid.
Good luck.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.989
It's a short par four.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.029
You wanna raise the bet?

08:18.480 --> 08:20.516
To $600?

08:20.960 --> 08:22.313
I love it.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.475
It's rough.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.034
Okay.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.553
What a lucky-ass shot.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.273
I'd rather be lucky than good.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.994
Ouch.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.832
Son of a bitch!

09:03.240 --> 09:04.958
That's gotta hurt.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.834
- Thank you.
- Find me more. Find me more.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.119
Come on, dance, pretty girl.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.149
Hello?

09:35.440 --> 09:37.635
Mr Eric P. Keller. How you doing?

09:37.880 --> 09:42.749
Not much, just enjoying a wonderful
little jaunt in my luxurious automobile.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.075
Hey, so, about that vehicle.
You about ready to turn it over to me yet?

09:48.280 --> 09:49.474
You ready to go hump your cousin?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.832
Oh. Now, now, see, there you go.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.717
We were having ourselves
a nice little conversation.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.153
...and you had to go and mess it up.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.310
...by being all rude.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.913
Somebody better learn you
some manners, boy.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.713
Yeah, you know, I blame my parents.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.030
Maybe my mom didn't hug me enough
or something, I'm not sure.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.873
What about you? I bet you breastfed
till you were 21, didn't you?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.430
I breast-feed every day, you little nubber.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.478
Let's not bring your folks into this, okay?
'Cause I just talked to your pappy.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.353
...and he seems like a real stand-up guy.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.479
Why would you talk to my dad?
The car's in my name.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.676
'Cause I was looking for you, son.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.159
He told me you was off at school.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.479
Say, tell me this.

10:23.560 --> 10:27.473
You got them palm trees out there
in San Diego, don't you?

10:31.520 --> 10:32.509
What's the matter?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.477
Cat got your tongue?

10:36.080 --> 10:37.513
You seem surprised, Eric.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.670
I think you underestimated me, boy.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.716
I can track a rabbit
through ten miles of horseshit.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.835
You think I can't find you?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.471
No, you know what? I'm sure you can.
I'm sure you can.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.677
You know what? You're probably
triangulating my phone signal right now

10:49.760 --> 10:52.433
with a pitchfork and a dowsing rod.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.673
You make all the fun you want to,
monkey boy...

10:55.760 --> 10:57.557
...but that vehicle is gonna be mine.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.394
All right, Mr Crazy-Ass Repo Man,
I gotta take off.

11:00.480 --> 11:04.109
Listen, it's been real.
I hope to run into you real soon.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.876
Yeah, you can bet on it.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.191
Here, kitty, kitty.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.589
Won't you be my kitty cat.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.673
That's him, the wonder boy.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.552
Mr Scratch Golfer.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.553
That's the little punk.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.676
He made a deuce
on the 18th at Cliffside.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.469
- Like he was doing it in his sleep.
He's costing us money.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.672
- Don't worry about a thing, Roman.
- We've got it covered.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.079
All right.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.668
- Wakes you up, doesn't it?
- I like it.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.477
- Yeah, hey, Dad.
Hey, Eric.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.593
- What's up?
- You need something? What's up?

11:42.680 --> 11:45.399
- Nothing. Just studying.
- Studying, huh?

11:45.480 --> 11:48.074
Yeah. Hey, listen. Did some guy call you
from the car dealership?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.515
Someone called my secretary.
What's up about that?

11:50.600 --> 11:52.192
No, no, everything's cool. Everything's cool.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.077
- There's some kind of recall on the brakes.
- Really?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.355
I don't know, they've been squealing,
making all kinds of noise.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.549
It sounds like an anvil
squashing a sack of kittens.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.595
Hot.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.749
He's got, like, those arms that are...

12:07.840 --> 12:09.398
Oh, my God.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.109
So, he really didn't like it, huh?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.679
Are you even listening to me, man?

12:13.760 --> 12:18.117
He didn't just"not like it", all right?
Hey, hey, hey. He fucking hated it.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.111
So what, dude? Who cares what he thinks?

12:20.200 --> 12:24.273
His buy-in would've made it a lot easier
to win over my old man.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.511
Yeah, but who cares? You're living proof
that the class doesn't mean shit!

12:27.640 --> 12:29.153
You're out there doing it in the real world.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.234
Well, that's it.
I'm taking a page out of your book.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.675
I'm dropping out
and running PAHR full-time.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.512
- Come on. What?
- You said it yourself.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.794
We're making it happen.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.111
I just need to focus on the business
and quit this useless school crap.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.556
You're insane. You're a madman.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.154
You're one to talk, elevator man.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.237
Hey, you guys.
Let's go get some tits on tape.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.313
Go with him. Keep an eye on him.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.359
Out of the three of us, he's the only one
that even stands a chance of graduating.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.429
Let's go.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.158
Ladies, who wants to
make a mistake tonight?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.275
Gross.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.475
Take that.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.915
- Hey, what's your name?
- Mandy.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.793
Mandy, if I told you, you had a rocking body,
would you hold it against me?

13:38.760 --> 13:40.079
Thanks.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.792
I love this dress.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.388
What did you say to her?

13:52.320 --> 13:53.799
Who? Oh, her?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.994
I may have mentioned that
you used to be a dude.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.309
What?

13:59.400 --> 14:02.153
It's believable.
You got like a really chiselled jaw line...

14:02.240 --> 14:05.755
well-defined traps, nice bone structure...

14:05.840 --> 14:06.829
Yeah.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.712
So what about these?

14:10.160 --> 14:11.513
Oh, those?

14:12.880 --> 14:14.029
Those can be faked.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.197
- Really?
- I read an article about it.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.759
So you can tell the difference?

14:18.080 --> 14:19.798
Oh, yeah, I've got mad skills.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.679
- I bet you do.
- Yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.911
Of course, I have to conduct
a full visual exam.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.468
...before we can begin
the physical portion of the exam.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.272
Well, I told you I would make my way here.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.072
Yeah, I knew you would.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.798
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.359
- With me?
- Yeah.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.354
What the hell is she doing here?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.397
I told you not to tell her about it.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.629
She found it herself, man.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.039
I was just telling her that
she should probably...

15:41.120 --> 15:42.599
I can speak for myself.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.073
If I want to be at a party, Ty,
I can be at a party.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.071
No, you can't, all right?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.833
You're leaving.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.838
Go. I'm serious, go.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.236
I'll deal with you later.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.233
Get off of me.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.435
Tough break, man. Tough break.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.596
You shouldn't mess with
your best friend's sister.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.432
I was just trying to keep her out of trouble.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.873
Yeah, right.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.839
Speaking of trouble,
I think she's looking to get into some.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.198
Yeah, I think she's looking at you, Mark.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.669
No way, she's all about the E-dog.

16:24.760 --> 16:28.150
Plus, I don't dig on the ginger.
I've got my eyes on that one.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.398
Mmm-mmm. Too young.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.233
Hey, you know what they say,
"If there's grass on the field, play ball."

16:36.320 --> 16:39.232
I don't even think there's grass on that field.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.629
Well, then I'll play in the dirt.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.956
You're a sick guy, Mark.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.270
A sick son of a bitch indeed.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.112
Go get her, E-dog.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.515
You're welcome!

17:16.560 --> 17:17.549
Okay.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.398
Will you stop?

17:22.680 --> 17:25.752
- No, you always do this stuff to me.
- Do what?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.036
You need to stop this, Ty.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.157
One of these days you're going to have to
let me grow up on my own.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.196
He's my best friend, Mandy.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.714
No. It's just a little too weird for me,
all right?

17:38.040 --> 17:39.029
Besides...

17:39.520 --> 17:41.238
...you don't know him like I do, all right?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.756
He's not the kind of guy
you want to be dating.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.912
He's never been anything
but sweet and nice to me.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.833
Come on. This isn't high school any more,
all right?

17:49.920 --> 17:51.399
He's changed.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.749
So have I.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.951
And so have I.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.359
Maybe I know what's best for me.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.278
Come on.

18:01.920 --> 18:02.909
Stop.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.197
How about instead of mooning over Eric,
you come spend some time with me?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.635
Your big bro.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.039
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:10.120 --> 18:14.193
But you're not Dad, you know. You can't
solve all problems with an ice cream cone.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.315
Really?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.908
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.629
Bye.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.795
And put some clothes on!

18:22.120 --> 18:23.109
Good night.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.517
Cover this. Not good hanging out.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.509
Sleep.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.108
Oh, shit!

18:59.920 --> 19:01.717
You, give me your shirt.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.475
Wait a minute.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.797
You can take my pants, too,
if you want them.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.472
Harder! Harder!

19:17.040 --> 19:18.109
Check these out.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.109
Come on.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.391
Nice. How much those set us back?

19:23.880 --> 19:24.949
Too much.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.793
But it's all gonna be worth it, man.
It's a huge break getting this spread.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.673
If you say so, man.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.439
If I say so?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.634
How do you think thousands of pro shops
across America.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.312
...decide what clothes to put on their racks?

19:38.960 --> 19:43.556
Golf Journal fall clothing edition!
We shoot the whole thing on Wednesday.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.030
- Dude.
- What's up, guys?

19:47.280 --> 19:48.508
Guess who brought pizza?

19:48.680 --> 19:49.669
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Sis.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.312
Pizza dude!

19:57.800 --> 19:59.153
Move over.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.517
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.318
Did your brother tell you
he's dropping out of school?

20:04.240 --> 20:05.389
You're dropping out of school?

20:06.640 --> 20:09.996
And you have the nerve to tell me
what I should and shouldn't do?

20:10.080 --> 20:12.196
That's different, all right? No.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.830
I have PAHR now, all right? It's my life.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.433
School's just getting in the way.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.197
What are you gonna tell Mom and Dad?

20:19.560 --> 20:21.790
Mom and Dad don't need to know right now.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.355
Guys, guys, guys, look! Check this out!

20:24.480 --> 20:26.198
This is my favourite commercial of all time.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.913
This is my favourite part. I love this chick.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.636
"But I have a big golf game
in two days.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.109
"Will I be able to play after the procedure?"

20:34.200 --> 20:36.077
"Of course, you will."

20:36.800 --> 20:37.994
Yay!

20:41.600 --> 20:43.079
What's that?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.798
It's a DVD I made of the party yesterday.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.869
Anything good?

20:46.480 --> 20:49.278
Check it out.
I spent all night cutting it myself.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.352
Good. I want to see what Ty made me miss.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.000
Yo, partner! Come here. Come on, man.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.678
- What do you think?
I don't know.

21:03.800 --> 21:04.869
I don't look so good in black.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.555
You can see my flakes.

21:07.560 --> 21:08.834
- This part's really cool.
- Are they...

21:10.040 --> 21:12.429
- Dude, did you film people screwing?
- Oh, yeah.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.475
Awesome!

21:16.200 --> 21:17.599
They didn't even know you were there?

21:17.760 --> 21:19.637
No way. I was in the shadows, hiding.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.393
Dude, your camera's all messed up.
This guy is all green.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.629
That's body paint, man.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.429
Body paint?
Who wears paint when they're doing it?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.750
It looks like Oscar the Grouch
is ploughing Elmo.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.719
It does kind of look like that.

21:30.920 --> 21:31.955
Freaks.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.352
I prefer blue myself.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.238
I bet you do, freak.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.595
Yo, E-dog. Check this out.
Jason filmed a porno.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.990
Big Dog to eat.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.832
God, this dialogue sucks.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.672
This guy sounds like he has a small dick.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.872
That guy sounds a lot like Eric.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.275
Bullshit.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.112
- Give me the remote.
- No. This is my first film.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.918
Give it to me, Big Dog Eric.
- Give me the remote.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.115
Give it to me!

21:54.640 --> 21:57.234
What? This is my film. My big debut.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.551
I'm a filmmaker.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.754
Is that you on there?

22:05.120 --> 22:07.918
No. Come on, are you crazy? Of course not.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.036
Tyler, do you even want your sister
seeing this crap, man?

22:10.440 --> 22:13.034
- Dude, is that paint on your back?
No! Uh-uh.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.952
Nope, it's not.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.350
No, it's guacamole. I can explain that!

22:18.600 --> 22:20.158
I can explain that.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.719
Don't bother.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.679
Wait, wait, wait, Mandy, Mandy.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.154
Come on.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.229
What's the big deal?

22:26.440 --> 22:27.793
Of course you side with him.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.750
That's what you guys always do.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.678
Stick together.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.316
Great job, Eric. Real good.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.829
What did I do?

22:37.200 --> 22:39.555
I don't know. Could it be the part
where you told my sister.

22:39.640 --> 22:40.914
I was dropping out of school?

22:41.200 --> 22:43.236
Or the part where you screwed another girl
in front of my sister?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.959
Yeah, well, I'm not the one who filmed it.
That was numb-nuts over here.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.508
Hey, I didn't know it was you. I mean, I was...

22:48.600 --> 22:51.433
Who goes around filming people
screwing anyway, you fucking pervert?

22:51.520 --> 22:52.748
- Hey, man, can I borrow that?
Yeah, sure.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.909
- No!
- No.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.989
See, Eric?

22:55.280 --> 22:57.635
It's shit like this
why I don't let you go out with my sister.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.798
You'd break her heart,
and then I'd have to kill you, all right?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.155
If she goes and tells my parents
that I'm dropping out of school...

23:03.240 --> 23:04.275
I'm screwed.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.913
I still don't know what I did.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.479
You never do.

23:08.680 --> 23:09.715
Face it, man.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.473
All you care about is a set of tits.

23:12.760 --> 23:16.673
- What else would you guys like?
- I'd like to get under that skirt.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.070
Sorry. There's only room
for one ass in this skirt.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.112
I like her style.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.676
Yeah, I see a bright future with you and her.

23:25.760 --> 23:26.749
Later in your room.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.517
So what's the deal, man?
You want to date Mandy or what?

23:30.600 --> 23:33.273
I don't know. Ty will kick my ass.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.998
Yeah, but do you like her?

23:36.320 --> 23:38.550
Yeah, she's an amazing little hottie.

23:38.640 --> 23:42.474
She's smart, and fun, and hot.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.119
Yeah, and?

23:44.960 --> 23:45.995
That's the problem.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.150
I can't just stop banging
a bunch of different girls.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.674
...and just bang one girl, you know?

23:51.200 --> 23:53.953
I see a hot girl and I have to have her.
It's bigger than me.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.395
Yeah, but it might be different
when you're with Mandy. You don't know.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.754
No, it won't.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.671
It won't. Trust me, dude. I can't control it.

23:59.960 --> 24:00.995
Sure you can.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.032
How? With castration?

24:03.440 --> 24:05.749
Have you tried punching your balls a lot?

24:06.080 --> 24:07.513
No, dude. I got it.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.352
Next time you see a hot girl.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.317
...and you start getting
all hot and bothered by her...

24:11.400 --> 24:13.516
...just picture her taking a shit, man.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.193
One of those nasty ones, too. You know,
when she's all pushing and grunting, like...

24:23.200 --> 24:24.269
Then all of a sudden...

24:27.040 --> 24:29.270
Just splatters the porcelain.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.349
You're an idiot.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.273
Yeah? Do you still
wanna bang the waitress?

24:37.400 --> 24:40.039
No, as a matter of fact,
I can say that I don't at the moment.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.633
See? You're cured.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.955
Ta-da!

24:43.040 --> 24:44.632
You can thank me later, bro.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.153
As for me...

24:46.560 --> 24:48.232
I'd still bang the waitress.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.437
I don't care
if she drops a deuce in my mouth.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.593
- Yeah, not hungry any more.
- Neither am I, man.

24:56.880 --> 24:57.869
Pussies.

24:58.880 --> 25:03.192
Thanks, fellows, for ruining
my favourite place to eat. Appreciate it.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.229
Fergus, what's up?

25:06.760 --> 25:10.196
Dude, I've got two doctors. It's all set up.
Cash buffet.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.109
They're leaving a trail of money, dude.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.596
Okay, cool, I'm on my way.

25:16.760 --> 25:21.470
All right. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
I have some business to attend to.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.639
You're gonna go let the Big Dog eat, Eric?

25:24.120 --> 25:26.076
Big Dog gonna eat good?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.357
Go feed the dog, Eric.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.519
He doesn't like me.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.711
Nice one there, Carlton.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.756
If I've told you once, I've told you
a thousand times to keep your head down.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.752
You're one to talk. With your side to side,
it's like you're swinging a machete.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.279
Maybe I am.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.435
Damn it.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.752
Well, now there's a nice swing.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.638
Hey, Carlton, I bet you 100 bucks
that you can't hit one 200 yards.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.755
It's just money.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.316
Make it $200 and you're on.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.392
Fine, you're on.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.272
Watch and learn.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.669
Easy come, easy go.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.031
It's a pleasure doing business with you, sir.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.830
Who thinks they can do 250?

26:55.800 --> 26:58.439
- Thanks for coming by on such short notice.
- No worries.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.599
I know what it's like to be stressed
and need a little release.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.229
Let go.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.197
Hey, and stop worrying about Mandy, okay?

27:09.280 --> 27:11.589
- She's just growing up.
- Thanks.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.228
I doubt she'd go to my parents...

27:13.320 --> 27:15.788
...but you never know what a girl will do
when she gets all emo.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.599
Well, the main target of her rage
is gonna be Eric, right?

27:18.800 --> 27:22.679
Good. Maybe it'll put an end
to her whole childish crush.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.473
I doubt it.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.511
He's gonna crash and burn.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.989
And we women, oh, we love that.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.157
I'll see you at the photo shoot
on Wednesday.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.198
You can call me
You can claw me.

27:44.280 --> 27:47.238
You can cover me up with dirt.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.710
You little feline flirt.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.272
Here, kitty, kitty.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.836
Won't you be my kitty cat?

28:07.640 --> 28:09.278
Not my lucky day, I guess.

28:09.360 --> 28:10.918
That's, what, five for you guys, four for me?

28:11.560 --> 28:12.754
And we're just getting warmed up.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.158
No, you idiot, he let us win those.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.549
No.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.913
Is that true, kid?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.149
Are you toying with us?

28:22.240 --> 28:24.231
If you want, I can just give you
your 100 bucks now.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.639
We'll just call it a day.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.948
See that, Carlton? Kid's just nervous.

28:30.760 --> 28:34.799
Now, I think we should double the stakes.
Say, $200 a hole?

28:35.280 --> 28:37.714
It's just money, right,
so why don't we just.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.229
...make it $500?

28:40.480 --> 28:45.429
Well, if it's just money, why don't we make it
50 grand and really have some fun?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.153
Fifty grand?

28:47.520 --> 28:48.953
You're nuts. I don't have that kind of money.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.873
- Maybe you don't have that kind of nuts.
- Maybe you should get on the man-wagon.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.837
- Maybe you should man up.
- Maybe grow some balls.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.150
- Maybe.
- All right. All right, fine.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.549
- Let's play.
- All right.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.671
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.997
If you lose, how are you going to pay us?

29:05.080 --> 29:06.149
We'll figure something out.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.639
That's not good.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.676
Do you know what we do for a living, Eric?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.270
Well, let me see, based on the outfits.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.399
...and the slice that can only be perfected
by playing once a week...

29:17.560 --> 29:19.278
I'm gonna guess doctors.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.433
We're not just doctors.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.397
- We're plastic surgeons.
- And damn good ones, too.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.195
Okay, great. You're still shitty golfers.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.109
He does this.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.550
Then you won't mind signing this release?

29:35.800 --> 29:36.789
What is that?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.874
That's a release form.
You see, we need a test patient.

29:39.960 --> 29:43.714
So, should you lose
and not be able to cover the bet...

29:44.280 --> 29:45.554
...you can pay us in trade.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.709
I'm sorry. Come again?

29:47.240 --> 29:49.959
It's just that we need someone
to try out our patented procedure on.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.189
You wanna operate on me?

29:51.280 --> 29:53.475
- No, no surgery, no cuts.
- No, no.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.518
It's just a simple little cosmetic touch-up,
it's completely reversible.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.509
You're out of your minds.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.799
See, I told you he didn't think
that he could beat us.

30:01.880 --> 30:02.869
We'll just pay someone...

30:03.320 --> 30:04.719
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

30:06.440 --> 30:10.479
Let me tell you something. You two couldn't
beat me on my worst day. Blindfolded.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.673
It's 50 grand.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.110
And I'll tell you what. We'll forget about
the 100 bucks you owe us...

30:15.200 --> 30:17.111
...and we'll play fresh from this hole on.

30:19.320 --> 30:22.278
What's the matter, kid,
you don't need 50 large?

30:25.760 --> 30:26.875
Never lost to a doctor.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.078
Prepare to kiss your money goodbye,
gentlemen. You're on.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.799
Hey, Fergus. You witness this?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.277
And your last name.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.473
All right.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.677
It's signed, it's official.
Let's tee this puppy up.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.079
- Nice.
- Hey.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.473
You guys smell that?

31:00.680 --> 31:01.908
What?

31:03.440 --> 31:04.475
My comeback.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.069
That reminds me of your drive
when you won the club championship here.

31:31.760 --> 31:35.958
Was that 2006 or 2007?
No, you won in 2007, right?

31:36.160 --> 31:37.673
You know I can't keep track any more.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.148
He can't.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.079
Well, looky there.
I believe that puts us up one hole already.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.879
Should I call the nurses
and tell them to start scrubbing up?

31:58.480 --> 32:00.948
All right. That'll be all, Fergus.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.079
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.233
Dude, I've got two kids. Maybe more.

32:10.680 --> 32:14.355
Yeah? I hope you sleep well later,
Sammy the Bull.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.559
Packing a gun.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.159
Nice one, kid.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.515
You could win, we could win. It's so close.

33:10.600 --> 33:15.037
This is bullshit. You guys hustled me.
This isn't even a fair match.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.111
I gotta play solo, you get to ham-and-egg it
the whole way.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.316
What about all that trash-talking
you were doing earlier?

33:19.400 --> 33:21.072
Yeah, besides, you agreed to the terms.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.435
- The terms are bullshit.
- The terms are signed.

33:23.520 --> 33:24.635
And witnessed.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.589
Last hole, a lot of pressure.

33:29.280 --> 33:33.398
It's okay. You'll look good with
a little enhancement, Mr Perfect.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.512
Shut the fuck up.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.312
Hey, thanks a lot, guys. That was fun.
Had a good time.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.399
Holy shit!

34:33.320 --> 34:34.992
No fucking way.

34:35.320 --> 34:36.911
Nice shot, partner!

34:39.520 --> 34:42.512
- Time to collect on our little agreement.
- The bet is off.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.875
Oh, come on, now. You gave us your word.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.473
You guys are on glue
if you think I'm hanging.

34:46.560 --> 34:50.030
Now, that is no way
to behave like a real man, Eric.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.632
- Not a man on the man-wagon.
- That's right.

34:51.719 --> 34:54.359
- Fuck you both. I'm out of here.
- You know what? We thought you'd say that.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.638
Instant and effective anaesthetic.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.711
- Can I try?
- Be careful.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.429
Are you ready for me?

35:14.960 --> 35:15.949
Mandy.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.035
Mandy.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.278
You gonna give it to me now, Big Dog Eric?

36:03.200 --> 36:04.599
Mandy?

36:10.560 --> 36:11.595
Mandy.

36:12.640 --> 36:13.629
Okay.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.715
Mandy.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.916
Little more pressure.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.672
Easy, easy.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.629
Easy.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.349
Easy.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.869
- Easy.
Nice.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.235
Okay, now just a little...

36:33.200 --> 36:35.270
Okay, just a little more.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.397
Easy does it. Great.
- Mandy.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.357
- There.
- Yeah. Wow.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.474
Here's to...

36:42.560 --> 36:44.551
Par-fection!

36:56.040 --> 36:57.109
Hmm?

36:57.560 --> 36:58.959
Morning, sunshine.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.389
Who's this?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.433
Someone from your home state.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.112
I got someone that wants to talk at you, boy.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.112
Hi, Eric.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.468
Professor Watley?

37:20.160 --> 37:22.549
You want that"A" we talked about...

37:23.560 --> 37:27.519
...you're going to have to do
some extracurricular activities.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.269
Let me talk at him.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.997
Let me talk at him.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.552
Hey, you best start going to class, boy.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.234
What's your pappy gonna say?

37:37.800 --> 37:39.518
Spending all that money.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.913
The noose is tightening, boy.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.589
The noose is tightening.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.190
The South will rise again!

38:06.720 --> 38:08.392
- What?
Wake up, bitch.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.839
- Huh?
- Dude, are you okay?

38:11.120 --> 38:12.189
You don't sound too good.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.196
Man, my head is killing me.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.077
Serves you right, jackass.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.430
That's what you get
for partying for two days straight.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.151
I bet you already blew through
that money you won, huh?

38:23.240 --> 38:25.515
- What?
- The golf match.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.233
I thought Fergus hooked you up
the other day.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.116
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Whatever.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.115
Just get down here ASAP.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.270
I'm on my way. I'm already in the car.
I'll be there.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.109
Oh, God.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.715
Oh, God. Oh, my God. What the fuck?

39:58.320 --> 40:00.197
What the fuck is that?

40:03.320 --> 40:05.072
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.189
You on your way?

40:10.320 --> 40:12.550
Tyler, Tyler,
I got a big fucking problem, man.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.995
- I just woke up...
- If you're not on your way here...

40:15.080 --> 40:16.399
...you're damn right you have a problem.

40:16.640 --> 40:19.074
- No, no, no...
- No, you don't understand.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.196
Get down here, pronto.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.318
Dude, I'm not kidding, all right?
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.112
No, Tyler, I...

40:30.200 --> 40:31.269
Fuck!

40:40.680 --> 40:42.318
Excuse me, sir, I'm looking for...

40:42.400 --> 40:43.435
Got jugs?

40:46.040 --> 40:47.917
Nice rack, bro.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.669
Hi, mister.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.592
Need some nuts?

41:05.880 --> 41:06.869
Fuck!

41:10.360 --> 41:11.349
Fuck.

41:17.960 --> 41:21.157
She unzips her wedding dress.
It falls to the floor...

41:21.360 --> 41:22.873
...and she's completely naked.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.434
She looks at me and she goes,
"I'm not married yet...

41:25.520 --> 41:28.193
"so how about a couple of pictures
for your personal collection?"

41:28.280 --> 41:30.669
- Bullshit.
- No, I swear to God. It's totally true.

41:30.760 --> 41:31.909
I got the pictures. You wanna see them?

41:33.360 --> 41:34.554
E- Mail.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.109
Men.

41:37.200 --> 41:40.715
- The man of the hour.
- All right, let's do this thing.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.549
I can't do this right now.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.439
What's with the jacket, dude?

41:45.880 --> 41:48.155
- It's like 80 out there.
- Listen to me.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.038
I can't do this right now.

41:51.120 --> 41:53.429
Eric, I'm not letting you do this to me again,
all right?

41:53.600 --> 41:54.635
- If you want to screw...
- Tyler.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.915
No. If you want to screw around
and mess up your own life, fine.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.718
But I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let you screw up mine.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.638
- Tyler...
- I'm not finished. I'm not finished, all right?

42:00.720 --> 42:04.156
You spend all of your free time just trying to
bone any girl that'll smile at you. No!

42:04.240 --> 42:07.471
And your game has gone to complete shit
because all you do is hustle.

42:07.560 --> 42:11.235
And now, you want to screw up
everything we've worked for.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.519
All I need you to do is step up, be a man...

42:14.600 --> 42:16.875
...and do this photo shoot,
so I can get the advertising campaign going.

42:16.960 --> 42:20.873
And you can't even do that,
'cause it's always about you, Eric.

42:22.360 --> 42:23.349
What are you doing?

42:29.520 --> 42:31.750
What the hell is this? A joke?

42:31.920 --> 42:34.912
- I wish.
- Very funny. Okay, you got me.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.555
Just take those off
and let's go do the photo shoot, all right?

42:37.640 --> 42:38.675
Let's go.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.320
Ty, this is not a joke. I'm serious.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.395
Those aren't real.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.790
They are real. Give me.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.673
Holy fucking shit!

42:50.760 --> 42:52.034
This is messed up, man.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.269
I know.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.596
- How the hell could this have happened?
- I don't know.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.477
- You don't know?
- Don't know.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.518
- We gotta do something.
- I know!

42:59.720 --> 43:00.869
Hey, you guys all right?

43:00.960 --> 43:02.757
- Yeah, yeah, we're good.
- Yeah, yeah, we're good.

43:02.840 --> 43:03.829
We're just...

43:04.120 --> 43:06.395
- We're good.
- We're just...

43:07.120 --> 43:08.553
Give us a minute.

43:09.640 --> 43:10.629
Talent, you know.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.389
So this is what you've been doing
the last two days?

43:13.480 --> 43:15.391
I guess. I don't know.
I don't remember anything.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.755
- What are we gonna do?
- Just relax, all right? I got it.

43:26.680 --> 43:28.398
We have a problem with the clothes.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.357
- What?
- I know.

43:30.960 --> 43:32.518
I pulled the wrong sizes.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.513
- He's gonna be pissed.
- I know.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.795
Can you just handle it for me, please?

43:36.880 --> 43:38.359
I need him out of here.
Just, whatever you have to do.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.908
- Just get him out of here.
- Great.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.637
What? What is going on?
- There's a little problem with the clothes.

43:46.720 --> 43:49.871
But they're going to fix it,
and we're gonna have to postpone.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.151
And you're sure
you've never seen these doctors before?

43:55.320 --> 43:56.878
No, I don't know.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.035
No. I don't think so.

43:59.440 --> 44:01.032
But you're sure about their names?

44:01.120 --> 44:03.236
Yeah, Hamilton and Carlton.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.829
So...

44:08.840 --> 44:10.910
Have you, like, pinched them and stuff?

44:11.120 --> 44:13.236
- Come on, dude.
- I'm just naturally curious.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.117
No, see, this is why
I didn't want to talk to you about this.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.918
- I'm not trying to be a dick or anything.
- Shut up, you are.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.752
- Trying to be a dick.
- It's not like I'm ever going to know.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.353
- What's the big deal?
- Just fucking drop it.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.429
Too soon?

44:27.120 --> 44:28.109
Why'd you take the bet?

44:28.360 --> 44:29.759
It was 50 grand.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.797
You should have been able
to sniff this one out.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.431
I thought I had them.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.150
I would've had them, too,
if I had my partner there.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.559
Don't put this on me, all right?

44:39.960 --> 44:41.916
I'm the one that told you to quit hustling.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.879
It just ends up screwing with your game,
or in this case, giving you tits.

44:48.360 --> 44:49.554
What do we do now?

44:50.560 --> 44:51.549
"We", huh?

44:52.520 --> 44:53.635
Come on, Ty.

44:57.840 --> 45:01.276
Well, first thing we gotta do
is track down these doctors, all right?

45:01.520 --> 45:02.748
And get them to take the tits out.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.435
Then, we sue them for everything they got.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.834
- Sound good?
- Yeah, sounds good.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.629
Do me a favour, though.

45:11.480 --> 45:12.469
Don't tell Mandy.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.309
What?

45:25.680 --> 45:27.750
We're testy, ain't we?

45:27.840 --> 45:29.990
- What is it, that time of the month?
- What?

45:31.520 --> 45:33.317
Oh, it's you. Listen, man...

45:33.400 --> 45:35.789
I really don't have time for this right now.

45:35.880 --> 45:38.917
Oh, I completely understand, Eric.
No problem at all.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.395
Why don't I bust out my scheduler.

45:42.080 --> 45:45.993
Okay, now what time should I
pencil you in for? Shall we say 4:00?

45:46.080 --> 45:49.629
Believe me, you are not
the most pressing issue in my life right now.

45:50.400 --> 45:51.628
Is that so?

45:51.720 --> 45:54.393
Well, then maybe I ought to
make myself more pressing. Hmm?

45:55.400 --> 45:57.436
Try to scare me all you want.
You're not scary to me any more.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.476
Okay? You want to know what scary is?

46:00.320 --> 46:03.995
Try waking up tomorrow morning
with a set of tits, pal. That's scary.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.549
I try to wake up
with a set of tits every day, fool.

46:09.640 --> 46:13.474
What the hell is wrong with this boy?
Ain't nothing scary about that.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.709
I got the address.

46:21.720 --> 46:24.359
- Hamilton and Carlton?
- Yes, please have a seat.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.034
Excuse me! Excuse me!

46:26.600 --> 46:29.398
You can't go in there! Please, stop.

46:29.480 --> 46:31.994
Dude, we should've knocked.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.830
- Sorry, Doctor, I told them.
- It's okay.

46:35.120 --> 46:36.997
Eric, I'm with a patient.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.992
Fuck you, psycho.
We need to talk, right now.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.069
About what?

46:40.760 --> 46:42.910
About what? About these.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.718
Those are exactly what I want.

46:45.920 --> 46:48.195
- Can you excuse me for just a minute?
- Sure.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.316
Okay. Sweetheart,
would you stay with Taylor?

46:50.400 --> 46:52.197
I'm gonna take care of these gentlemen.

46:56.960 --> 46:59.076
- Fourteen-pounders?
- Yeah.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.229
- You like them?
- I do.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.711
Look what the surgeon dragged in.

47:04.080 --> 47:08.198
Wow. Looking good, Eric.
Nice to see you again.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.430
Cut the shit.
You gave me tits, you're taking them out.

47:10.520 --> 47:11.748
Chocolate, boys?

47:14.640 --> 47:17.313
The way we remember it is,
we had a deal, Eric.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.715
Fuck the deal.
You hustled me, motherfucker.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.791
- You hustled me, motherfucker!
- Yo, yo. Chill, chill, chill.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.553
It was a fair bet. You agreed to the terms.

47:24.640 --> 47:27.950
We've got the legal forms in our files.
Signed and witnessed.

47:28.560 --> 47:31.552
- Any soreness?
- Get off me! I don't care what you have.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.598
You performed surgery on me
against my will, dick.

47:34.800 --> 47:37.234
- Yeah, we'll go to the cops!
- Nice to see you, Tyler.

47:37.360 --> 47:38.349
Mr PAHR.

47:40.600 --> 47:43.319
- How do you know me?
- It doesn't matter.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.989
You can do what you want.
You can protest, you can go to the cops.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.116
But the fact remains is,
you signed the release.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.475
...and we were just performing the surgery
to your wishes.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.872
All right, come on. What's it gonna take
to cover the bet and get them out?

47:58.200 --> 47:59.599
Fifty grand.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.437
- He doesn't have that much.
- Then the hooters stay.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.799
All right, you know what?
I'll just go to another surgeon.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.791
They'll take them out for less than 50 grand.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.393
Might even feel sorry for me
and take them out for free.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.993
Yeah, let's go.

48:12.160 --> 48:13.832
You know what?
That's not like that, actually.

48:14.480 --> 48:17.870
It's a patented procedure
that nobody can perform but the two of us.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.316
In fact, there's not a doctor in the free world
who'd risk his career to even touch you.

48:21.840 --> 48:22.829
Better hope we stay healthy.

48:23.360 --> 48:27.512
And should you decide to go to Mexico
or some other such place...

48:27.600 --> 48:30.353
...or, God forbid, take them out yourself...

48:31.200 --> 48:33.191
...here's what would likely happen.

48:35.600 --> 48:39.878
- It's upside down.
- There we go. Sorry about that.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.793
Picture your mom's face
as she opens up the mail one day.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.758
Or your dad.
"What has our son done to himself?"

48:45.840 --> 48:49.879
- You don't even know my parents.
- You mean Mr Doug Keller...

48:49.960 --> 48:52.394
...majority stock-holder
of Oswald Manufacturing...

48:52.480 --> 48:54.198
...charter member
of Champion Creek Country Club?

48:54.440 --> 48:55.555
Imagine the first board meeting.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.839
A crisp white envelope
for each board member.

48:58.920 --> 49:03.675
...containing a nice eight-by-ten glossy
of the favourite son.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.958
With a sweet set of hooters.

49:06.040 --> 49:09.112
The only modelling you're gonna be doing
is for our next ad campaign.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.077
- Hey, that's good.
- I'm an idea man.

49:11.320 --> 49:12.435
You guys are sick.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.399
Why me? What did I do to you?

49:17.920 --> 49:19.512
You lost a bet, hotshot.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.878
Now, bring us the 50 grand
and end this freak show.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.551
How am I supposed to
come up with 50 grand?

49:26.080 --> 49:28.310
You're a smart kid.
You'll think of something.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.874
Now, why don't you two boys run along.

49:30.960 --> 49:33.349
...before we send our office manager
out for stamps.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.436
And, Eric.
Get us that 50 grand within two weeks.

49:37.520 --> 49:39.590
...or Hamilton and I are gonna start
a mass-mailing campaign.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.677
And let us know if there's any leakage.

49:42.760 --> 49:45.513
There shouldn't be any, but let us know.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.397
Leakage, very bad.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.799
Toodeloo, boys.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.433
Calm down.

49:53.400 --> 49:56.915
Stop, man, we need to figure this out.

50:04.840 --> 50:06.193
You done?

50:06.640 --> 50:10.110
Come on.
What are we gonna do for the 50 grand?

50:11.200 --> 50:12.997
What about your dad?

50:13.080 --> 50:16.231
- No, Tyler. Not an option.
- Come on, he's your dad.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.709
- Dude, he'll understand.
- Oh, yeah, you think so?

50:18.880 --> 50:20.233
"Yeah, hey, Dad, it's me.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.993
"I lost a bet on the golf course
and I owe some guy 50 grand.

50:23.080 --> 50:25.469
"I'm not going to class any more
'cause I fucked my teacher...

50:25.560 --> 50:28.791
"and I lost my car. It got repossessed
because I spent all my money at Players.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.474
"And, by the way, I have a set of tits.
Can you wire me 50 grand?"

50:31.560 --> 50:33.755
- Are you out of your mind?
- We might need to wordsmith that a bit.

50:33.920 --> 50:34.989
Yeah, you think?

50:43.040 --> 50:44.109
How much can PAHR help?

50:44.240 --> 50:47.118
If I had 50 grand,
I would've dropped out a long time ago.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.993
So, what are we gonna do?

50:54.960 --> 50:56.279
Best ball.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.639
You mean it? You're back?

51:00.000 --> 51:01.115
I put everything I had into.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.589
PAHR's new advertising campaign
featuring you, all right?

51:03.680 --> 51:05.716
You can't do it like this.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.350
But hey, this time it's gonna be different.
All right?

51:08.640 --> 51:13.395
No partying, no drinking, no sex. All right?
Nothing but practise and sleep. Understand?

51:13.600 --> 51:15.989
Yeah, no, totally. Yeah.
Where am I gonna go party with these?

51:16.080 --> 51:18.036
Yes, for sure.
Whatever you say. You're the boss.

51:18.120 --> 51:20.031
Okay, we need opponents, fast.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.315
We gotta spread the word.
Take anything that comes our way.

51:23.640 --> 51:26.518
- Think we can pull this off?
- Damn straight.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.189
Hey, listen, Tyler...

51:30.280 --> 51:33.033
Yeah, yeah. Don't get all queery-bit on me,
Barbie. All right?

51:33.240 --> 51:34.559
Come on, let's go win some money.

51:40.840 --> 51:42.876
So, what's the stakes?
What are we playing for?

51:43.320 --> 51:44.799
- Five thousand.
- Five thousand's good.

51:44.880 --> 51:45.949
- Sound good?
- Sounds good.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.558
What's the matter?
You got the shanks now?

51:56.680 --> 51:58.830
My bad. I must've slipped.

51:59.320 --> 52:02.312
Don't worry about it. All right?
Just don't do it again.

52:02.440 --> 52:03.634
- All right.
- All right.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.993
What's the deal, man?
Get your head in the game.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.190
It's not my head, it's this jacket.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.193
Then take it off.
Seriously, it's 1,000 degrees out here.

52:16.280 --> 52:20.876
- You're probably lactating under there.
- Give me a few strokes. I'll get it.

52:21.400 --> 52:23.356
- I'll get it.
- All right.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.951
That's it, all right? Take it off, now.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.112
- Dude, take it off.
- Fuck, dude!

52:29.200 --> 52:32.431
- What the fuck, man?
- My rules! My rules, remember? My rules.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.231
- Take it off.
- All right.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.072
Jesus fucking Christ.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.909
Thank you.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.234
What the hell is that?

52:41.320 --> 52:45.757
What? Are we here to play golf
or stare at my friend's deformity?

52:47.280 --> 52:49.999
That's sick. I'm not playing
with no freak show, that's for sure.

52:50.160 --> 52:53.118
Fine. Then just give us the money
and be on your way.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.998
Don't worry, Dan. We can handle these two.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.395
All right, fine. Fine, all right.

53:06.960 --> 53:09.713
- What's your problem?
- Is it wrong I wanna touch them?

53:19.920 --> 53:21.069
Hey.

53:27.680 --> 53:29.716
You have got to loosen up.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.109
They're out now and there's nothing
you can do about it, all right?

53:32.200 --> 53:35.237
So just get it out of your mind and just play.

53:51.320 --> 53:52.435
Fuck!

53:55.200 --> 53:56.918
Maybe we should take the day off, man.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.149
Give your mind some time to wrap around...

53:58.240 --> 54:00.959
That isn't the problem.
They're flopping all over the place!

54:11.960 --> 54:14.190
He'll be here soon, all right?

54:14.280 --> 54:16.316
I can't believe
we're relying on this guy.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.789
Just trust me, all right?

54:25.160 --> 54:29.358
- Seriously, dude. I had no idea.
- Whatever, man. You're dead to me.

54:30.160 --> 54:31.673
I didn't know.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.189
Hey.

54:37.280 --> 54:42.149
- I can't wear this, it's pink.
- But it's Nike."Just do it."

54:46.320 --> 54:49.596
- Make sure nobody sees me.
- I got you, don't worry.

54:51.360 --> 54:53.555
You guys want to turn around?

54:55.320 --> 54:57.356
Give the man some privacy.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.837
You can reach over and hold each other
if you want, but that's about it, all right?

55:02.440 --> 55:03.429
- You all right?
- Yeah, I got it.

55:04.320 --> 55:06.675
Turn around! I'm serious.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.715
- How does that feel?
- It's tight.

55:12.800 --> 55:16.759
Look, we can take care of that, all right?
For now, grip it and rip it.

55:16.840 --> 55:18.193
All right.

55:44.920 --> 55:51.268
- He's back, baby. How did that feel?
- Good. Real good.

55:51.960 --> 55:54.110
You boys are in trouble now.

56:02.640 --> 56:04.915
All right, cough it up. Let's go.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.995
It's okay, don't be bummed out.
Losing makes you stronger.

56:11.920 --> 56:13.353
- Here.
- Thanks.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.553
You boys ready to play some golf or what?

56:26.080 --> 56:27.433
You can play with these if you want.

58:31.080 --> 58:32.911
Do I look fat to you?

58:33.440 --> 58:34.793
- What?
- Be honest.

58:37.240 --> 58:38.514
Oh, shit.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.759
What's up, guys?
- Hey, man. What's up?

58:41.840 --> 58:43.512
How's it going. What's up, man?

58:43.600 --> 58:46.273
Hey, E-dog, where you been, man?
Everyone's been looking for you.

58:46.360 --> 58:47.839
- Hey, what up?
- What's up, man?

58:47.960 --> 58:49.552
Hey, we're going to go get some beers
over at Players.

58:49.640 --> 58:50.709
You guys should totally come.

58:50.800 --> 58:53.678
Dude, that would be awesome, but...

58:53.920 --> 58:55.592
- I'm just tired.
- Yeah, I'm beat.

58:55.680 --> 58:56.999
We've been working.
We got the photo shoot...

58:57.080 --> 58:58.479
Yeah, we got tons of stuff to do.

58:58.560 --> 59:00.835
Wait. You guys are turning down beers?
What's going on here?

59:00.960 --> 59:02.393
Yeah, you've disappeared for two days.

59:02.480 --> 59:06.439
You going snowboarding or something?
What's up with that jacket?

59:08.160 --> 59:10.310
- Okay, all right...
- Ty, no.

59:10.480 --> 59:13.677
- They need to know. They need to know!
- You guys, what's going on?

59:16.040 --> 59:19.555
We need money fast, all right.
PAHR's future depends on it.

59:19.640 --> 59:22.074
Problem solved, you guys.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

59:22.600 --> 59:24.716
My roommate freshman year had a girlfriend.

59:24.800 --> 59:27.712
whose cousin lived across the street
from a friend of Darius Vernon.

59:27.800 --> 59:29.597
- What? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

59:29.680 --> 59:33.434
You know, O.G., Ice Pyk.
Ice Pizzy in the hizzy.

59:34.800 --> 59:35.949
The rapper?

59:36.040 --> 59:38.554
He's a music producer now.
He lives here in San Diego.

59:38.640 --> 59:39.868
I could get us a meeting.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.188
Dude, no, no.

59:41.280 --> 59:43.111
Are you kidding me?
That guy's a huge businessman.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.668
He invests in companies
in San Diego all the time.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.796
- No, we'll raise the money ourselves.
- Thank you.

59:47.880 --> 59:49.916
You really wanna help us out,
you really wanna do us a favour?

59:50.000 --> 59:53.197
You hear of anybody that's looking for
some golf action, you send them our way.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.272
- Okay.
- All right.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.909
Shut up.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.873
- Not happening?
- Nope.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.558
Oh, my God, Mandy.
Your brother is gonna totally flip.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.669
Eric P. Keller. Where's my car, boy?

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.116
- Oh, shit.
- Come here, man.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.034
Sorry.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.594
Keep running, I'm gonna track you.
I'm gonna get you.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.998
End of the line, turkey balls!

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.835
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
where did that little shitbird go?

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.996
If he hollers, don't let him go.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.114
Can't a lady
get a little bit of privacy! Get out, asshole!

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.715
Excuse me. I'm sorry, ma'am. Excuse me.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.994
Get out, you fucking dick.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.153
Goddamn California.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.948
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.712
I don't even know what to say to this guy.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.439
Relax. Didn't you pitch
the whole PAHR 72 thing to your professor?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.672
Yeah, and he hated it, all right? No.
And that was just a professor.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.069
I didn't have to worry about him killing me
if he didn't like the idea.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.071
Dude, look around.
There's plenty of people here.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.832
If he kills us, there'll be lots of witnesses.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.113
I'm joking, man. You're too uptight.
We'll be fine.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.190
Mr Vernon will be with you shortly.
You can wait right over there.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.710
I should've used the bathroom before I left.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.916
There's a bathroom right there.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.989
Can't.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.390
Oh, man, I never knew you were
one of those guys that can't crap in public.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.311
- That's hilarious.
- That's not it.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.676
- Yeah, it is.
- I like to take a shower afterwards.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.718
Oh, my God.
You have to take a shower after you shit?

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.789
Maybe you're doing something wrong, dude.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.915
It's just preference.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.719
No. I know a lot about poop.
I'm gonna help you out with this, bro.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.949
I got a lot of experience with this.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.474
Okay, first of all,
are you sitting down when you're doing it?

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.393
- Dude, it's just preference.
- Are you sitting down?

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.199
Yes, cock-monkey, I'm sitting down.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.435
What about your pants?

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.033
Are your pants still pulled up
or do you have them down?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.634
- I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
- If you still have them pulled up...

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.914
I think I might've solved
the problem right there.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.319
- You're such a prick, you know that?
- Toilet paper.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.958
Are you remembering
to use toilet paper afterwards?

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.393
- 'Cause that could be it.
- You're not getting this.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.358
Dude, what am I not getting here?
Why can't you shit like a normal person?

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.750
Okay, smart guy,
next time you have to take a shit...

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.673
...shit in your hand,
and then wipe that shit with toilet paper.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.320
...and then tell me that your hand is clean.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.309
- Okay, I see your point.
- Exactly.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.469
Dude, I get that, okay.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.676
But there are some places on my body
I'm willing to accept the fact.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.512
...they're not always 100% clean.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.319
I mean, I eat with my hands sometimes,
but never my ass.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.635
Mr Vernon will see you now.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.114
All right, saggy diapers...

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.839
...see if you can keep your poop in your pants
long enough to get through this.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.035
I make no promises.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.270
Dude, don't worry about it. Okay?

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.715
The guy that lived across from me
freshman year was black.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.309
What?

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.035
My assistant says
you have a business proposition for me.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.833
Well, Mr Ice Pyk.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.473
Just Darius.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.957
Darius, do you play golf?

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.589
Just broke 90.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.109
That's sweet.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.478
Anyway, I started this golf company called
PAHR.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.837
We make golf clothes.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.998
So anyway, we...

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.314
I got it.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.148
Yo,
check it, dog. Here's the dizzle, my nizzle.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.869
My homeboy T-bone here be all up
in the membranes like some Einstein shit...

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.030
...talking bout swole in the dome, right?

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:35.271
He started this fat-ass biz,
selling some fly-ass golf threads.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.399
Plus, he be rolling deep with this badass
golfer who got mad skills like Tiger and shit.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.311
But now he's all hurting for snaps.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.356
So, I'm all like,"Bitch, hit up a bank, yo."

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.510
He's all like,"Nigga, please."

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.033
So, that's why I brought him to you.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.588
Trust me, homie, you gonna look like
the motherfucking bomb.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.318
...sporting T-bone's fly-ass threads.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.992
Ain't no better way
to get a fly-ass shorty.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.548
with a fat-ass booty
come jocking on the old ice pick...

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.629
...you know what I'm saying?

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.871
She sees you with a big-ass club,
busting a cap in the ball's izzass...

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.315
...she'll be all up in yo junk
and you'll be waxing that ass.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.594
...like a drop-top six-fo in no time.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.916
I mean, you look like
a man who likes booty, right?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.035
I love booty.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.236
I put on one of these golf joints,
went to the club...

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.118
...fifteen big-ass booty ho's
were all up in my shit.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.191
It was like a sea of Missy Elliotts in the joint.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.033
I'm telling you, yo, T-bone's clothes
are fitting to blow the fuck up...

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.351
...and you got a chance to get up in that shit
on the ground motherfucking floor.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.991
You going be one rich nigga. Feel me?

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.152
I thought that went pretty...

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.357
Not a word, Mark. Not a fucking word.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.789
What the hell?

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.830
I want you to find out everything you can
about this golf company, PAHR.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.988
Yo, E-dizzle.
You sure you wanna trade cars?

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.718
Mine's a shit box.
This thing is practically new.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.074
Yeah, yeah. Just temporarily.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.072
I got this chaw-chomping,
redneck repo-man guy looking for me.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.230
Once he starts missing his goats,
he'll head back to Virginia.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.435
Okay.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.918
You cannot bring this anywhere near
my apartment, anywhere near school.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.638
Yeah. Sure.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.548
Awesome.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.429
Thanks, E-dog.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.758
Nice ride, boys.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.359
Dude. This car is nectar, bro.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.919
- Sweet.
- Yes.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.634
- We're so cool.
- Hell yeah.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.756
- Dude, your phone.
- It's not my phone.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.592
Well, it's not my phone.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.271
- Hello.
This is Eric's dad.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.476
Oh, hey, Eric's dad. It's Mark.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.152
- Is Eric around?
- No, he's not here.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.754
He lent me his car.
I guess he forgot to take his phone out.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.469
You're driving Eric's car?
Did he tell you about the brakes?

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.439
- No, he didn't tell me about the brakes.
- Well, he told me there was a recall.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.956
So I put together a list of dealers in the area
so he could get them fixed.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.634
- Wow. Okay.
- Have him give me a call when you see him.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.915
- Yeah, sure. I'll tell him you called.
- Thanks.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.757
Dude, no wonder he gave me the car.
This thing needs new brakes.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.829
What?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.718
- Two can play at that game.
- Wait. What are you gonna do?

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.314
I'm gonna fix this thing.
I'm keeping this bitch.

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.349
That's five.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:40.118
How can we lose to anybody that has boobs?

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.514
Nice job.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.471
Give a girl a titty hit.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.952
I can smell him. I know he's close.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.314
Bingo.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.796
Hey, back it off, Ho Chi Minh, back it off.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.316
Or I'll put these size-12 American-made
boots right up your ass.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.149
Tell your boy Eric I got his ass.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.756
I think you're gonna need these.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.350
$40,100...

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.630
$40,200.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.879
We're still short.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.398
- Deadline's tomorrow.
- Yeah.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.959
But this is a lot of money.
I mean, it's got to count for something.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.909
Right?

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.431
Here it is. Most of it, anyway.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.037
Most of it? I don't like the sound of that.
Do you, Carlton?

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.240
It's almost all there, it's like $40,200.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.958
Almost isn't all.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.112
Eric, we're businessmen.
We can be reasonable.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.477
What is this little venture you have
with your partner?

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.790
Some kind of clothing line?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.950
What are you, the fucking Hardy Boys?
How do you know about that?

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.270
Once again, not your concern.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.828
What would you say
the value of this little company is?

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.798
- Why?
- Perhaps a barter is in order?

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.194
You give us the company
and we take Cagney and Lacey out.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.359
I can't. I only own half the company.
Tyler owns the other half.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.590
I can't. I can't give it away. It's not mine.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.033
Well, then the tits stay.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.874
- I'm just gonna run off to the post office...
- Wait, come on.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.758
Hey, we can be reasonable here, right?

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.273
How about if we play
you and your partner, Tyler?

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.388
That way, if you win, you keep the $40,000
and we take these out, everybody's happy.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.551
And if you lose...

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.199
They get PAHR if we lose?

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.359
We won't lose.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.839
Come on, we won't. You said it yourself,
I'm playing the best golf of my life.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.273
Maybe it's the tits.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.229
Okay.

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.957
But do you really want to bet
our entire future off on a single golf match?

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.991
We're not betting anything away.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.435
Just think about what PAHR could do
with that money.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.078
We could pay ourselves salaries.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.996
So whatever. Let's just go
beat these assholes, keep their money.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.554
Our money.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.232
- Come on, Ty. It's one last game.
- Okay.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.789
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.915
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.593
I'm sorry,
why are you bringing me here?

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.670
Joslyn said it was important.
I don't know, man.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.552
- They're here. Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.832
Come on, we've been waiting for you.
What took you so long? Join us.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.839
Hey, boys.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.434
- What's going on?
- Have a seat, Eric.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.071
Yeah, straddle that bench.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.274
E- Dog, listen, man,
we're seriously worried about you.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.834
You've been drinking way too much.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.991
You flat-out disappear.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.033
It's gotten to the point where you messed up
a very important photo shoot.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.354
What's up with that jacket?

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.035
And you almost put your best friend
and business partner through financial ruin.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.917
And you put me and Jason in danger, man.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.039
Okay, guys. What's going on here?

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.512
Tyler, this is an intervention. We're trying
to help Eric get through his issues.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.795
- He doesn't have any issues. He's fine.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:19.230
Intervention? Hold on a second.
Hold on. I don't have an issue.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.869
- Denial.
- See, textbook, man. You got a problem.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.111
Guys, I really appreciate
what you're trying to do here, all right?

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.918
But Eric and I have everything under control.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.592
Tyler, no. You're not helping!

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.469
Hold on! Hold on a second!
Everybody just shut up for a second!

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.317
I'm not an alcoholic.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.069
Well, I am, sort of,
like in a college frat boy kind of way...

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.355
...but look, that's not the issue. Okay?

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.959
These are.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.597
- What the fuck?
- Okay, this is beyond...

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.389
- Okay, don't freak. Hold on a second.
- This is beyond an intervention.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.710
- Jos, I can explain everything.
- The whole fuck buddy, booty call...

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.756
Wait a minute, that's what you've been
doing the last two weeks?

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.829
No.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.229
Come on, Big Dog, bust them out again,
man. I wanna see them.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.153
Stay the fuck away from me, Mark.
I'll give you the fucking haymaker, man.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.676
Look, I really care about you,
but this is really fucked up, Tyler.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.988
I can explain everything, all right?

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.992
Dude, he's got jiggly titties.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.117
Jiggly titty, you got that jiggly titty.

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.031
You got that jiggly titty...

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.115
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.670
- Mark. What are you doing?
- You fucking dick!

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.149
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.437
- You are disgusting!
- Mandy, hold on.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.031
- Stop it. Stop it.
- What?

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.319
I can explain all this.
Look, it's all a big fuck up, okay.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.793
I know I've been cheating, I've been lying
to people, I've been lying to you...

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.078
...but the boobs have made me a better person.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.080
- I know, that sounds really stupid.
- Save it, Eric.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.033
I came here tonight
because I was worried about you.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.790
I don't even think you and I
are on the same planet.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.755
No, no, that's not true. We are.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.273
"Come on, Mandy,
they're only a C-cup."

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.669
"Only a C-cup?
They're bigger than mine."

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.955
"Why are you so mad? I got them for you."

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.595
"Eric, I said if you got boobs,
they'd have to be a B-cup."

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.513
"I'm sorry,
but four titties are better than two. Right?"

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.388
"No. Oh, my God, Eric,
I am not a lesbian any more."

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.550
"Just touch them one time.
Don't you want to motorboat?"

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.950
No, I'm not into kinky stuff.
Who said I was into kinky stuff?

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.158
- I can't do this.
- Let me explain. Shit.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.875
Dude.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.237
Can I get my car keys?

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.071
Thanks, man. The repo man took your car.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.310
- What?
- I know, I know.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.115
Get in the car, Vanilla Ice.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.597
Hey, Mandy. What's up? It's Eric.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.192
Just calling to see what's up.
Give me a call when you get this.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.509
I'd love to hear from you.
Yeah, give me a buzz.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.794
Ready?

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.432
What's going on?

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.511
- What is all this?
- What does it look like?

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.919
You guys are on the map.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.470
And I got San Diego CNTV
to stream the whole thing.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.473
Why are all these people here?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.519
- It doesn't matter.
- Really?

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.034
- It works out in our favour, though.
- And how's that?

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.237
Well, you see, Mr Cover Girl
can't hide from this kind of publicity.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.360
Company stays on top. PAHR goes down.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.397
Mmm-hmm. Good.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.871
What's the president of Ash-Whole
doing here?

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.393
If I were you, I wouldn't worry about that.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.277
I'd be worrying about the double bogeys
coming your way.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.395
Bogey-bogey.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.517
He put you up to this.
That's why you want PAHR.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.113
Put us up to this? No.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.431
We created this company.
We're the majority stock holders.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.796
What? You think you are the only two
geniuses that can sell a cotton-poly blend?

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.158
Enough! Get ready to have your asses
handed to you.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.232
The only ass that's gonna be handed
is yours.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.472
- Oh, wait. Here's your ass now.
- And here's a spanking.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.155
Faster. Yeah, smack that ass.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.356
Pastor, that hurts.
- Right.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.195
Anybody hear anything from Mandy?

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.633
She said she had something important to do.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.233
I haven't seen Mark in two days either.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:05.835
Hey, I just found out the answer
to this whole mystery.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.318
I'm gonna go hit some balls.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.471
We're live in three, two...

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.154
Hi, I'm Scott, and welcome to
the first annual Cuda Challenge...

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.310
...brought to you by San Diego CNTV.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.834
We're here at the beautiful
Borrego Springs Resort.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.672
It's a hot one, and tensions are mounting...

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.433
...so grab a cold drink,
we're about ready to tee off.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.999
Fucking golf.
They've got me broadcasting fucking golf...

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.312
An extremely blustery day
here at the course...

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.073
...as we get a look at
the PAHR team's secret weapon up close.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.037
...to begin the tournament.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.237
- Hello, Scott.
- We welcome Stephanie to the broadcast.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.989
Her handlers finally finished with
the Herculean task of applying her makeup.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.113
Now that I can see your crow's feet up close,
I can cancel my trip to the Grand Canyon.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.109
Let's do it.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.678
My back is killing me, dude.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.590
That's what we're here to fix. Let's do it.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.155
Eric.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.231
Great place to put a fucking tree.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.559
Oh, yeah.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.673
Oh, Daddy!

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.550
It's okay, let that one go. It's okay.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.517
- No, no.
- Don't do this.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.999
Son of a bitch.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.872
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.514
Eric sucks at golf. Eric sucks at golf.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.949
I don't think it's too early to call.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.316
With the docs this far ahead,
I'm putting my money on them.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.068
We'll be right back.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.798
What the hell was that?

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.952
- Had to lay up.
- Bullshit. You could've made that shot.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.635
- No, not today I can't.
- What's the matter with you?

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.157
We've finally got a surefire way of getting
rid of those things and you're blowing it.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.110
- I was hoping Mandy would come.
- That ship has sailed, my friend. All right?

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.512
You blew your chance with her.
There's nothing we can do about it now.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.197
Just get your head in the game, Eric.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.279
Looks like your friend is
getting used to having that rack.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.757
I'm getting the impression that
he wants to keep them forever and ever.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.839
No, stop. All right.
You can't do this to me, man.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.599
We're gonna lose if you don't pick it up.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.989
No, I can't beat these guys
on my own. Okay?

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.594
I know, I'm sorry. It's this thing with Mandy.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.552
I'm in love with her, Ty.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.829
- What?
- I know. I don't know.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:10.789
Ever since I got these hooters,
I don't feel complete without her.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.069
Okay.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.469
Let's just not talk about that right now.
I need you to focus, okay?

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:25.276
I can't. Not until I...

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.473
- Oh, shit. It's my dad.
- What?

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.276
You sent that envelope?

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.957
- Yes, we definitely sent the envelope.
- Yeah, sorry.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.476
It was just sitting there
with a stamp on it.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.949
And it slipped into the box.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:47.397
- Hey, Dad, I can explain this...
- It's okay, Eric. I know what happened.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.596
- You do?
- Mandy told me everything.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.194
Mandy?

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.638
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.035
Hey, it's really good to see you.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:02.188
I'm sorry I'm late, I just wanted to make sure
your dad understood everything.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.032
Like I finally did.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.398
Mandy tells me
you made $50,000 playing golf.

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:11.749
Yeah.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.319
Why didn't you just come to me?

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.314
No, I couldn't come to you.
It was my fault. I got in way over my head.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.675
I was letting golf
get in the way of my classes, and I wasn't...

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.034
Whoa!

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.236
$50,000 from golf?

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.437
Maybe the school is getting in the way
of your golf.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.039
I mean, it's something to think about.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.352
Now you better get back in there.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.518
Unless you plan on keeping those ta-tas.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.150
Mandy, on the other hand...

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.673
She's a keeper.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.958
- I'll see you on the 18th.
- All right, Dad.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.519
Wait, Mandy, hold on.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.354
Come on, take your shot
or forfeit the hole, Erica.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.111
- Served.
- Psych.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.111
- You need to go.
- No, I have to say this first. Okay?

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.199
I'm sorry.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.118
I'm sorry I didn't realise how stupid I was.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.350
I'm sorry it took you giving up on me.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.199
...in order for me to figure out
that I can't give up on you.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.194
None of this means anything now.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.748
The tits, the golf game,
none of it means anything.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.479
...unless I know that we still have a shot.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.711
None of it matters
unless I know I haven't lost you.

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.714
Eric, you never lost me.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.672
It's gonna take a lot more than
another set of boobs to come between us.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.278
We can talk more later.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.639
First, you need to get out there.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.632
...and show those slimeballs
how a real man plays golf.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.912
- Everything okay?
- Everything is perfect.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.513
- Ready to finish this?
- Hell yeah.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.113
Let's do it.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.558
Bore me to death.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.029
Yes! Unbelievable. Yes!

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.269
Oh, my God!

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.273
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.437
That bold prediction you made earlier
really didn't pan out for you, did it, Steph?

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.555
Bite me.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.993
And we're tied here at the 18th...

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.230
while everybody waits patiently
for their favourite freak.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.311
What are you thinking?

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.549
A little right to left, slightly uphill.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.875
All right, you got this, man.
Sink it and we win.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.839
Yes!

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.913
- You did it.
- We did it.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.834
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was a good one.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.995
- You guys, wow! Super duper.
- Super duper.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.673
Just want you to know...

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.639
...you didn't think we were really gonna
honour our little agreement, did you?

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.951
- You're keeping those titties.
- And we're still going to crush PAHR.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.390
Good game, fellows. Nice.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.318
- Call us.
- 1-800-NuBOOBS.

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.910
Relax, man, it's cool.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.591
I like your line.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.349
- Still looking for investors?
- Yeah.

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.149
- But the last time, you said...
- Yeah, I know about the last time.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.071
And I'm sure
that'll never happen again, right?

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.628
- No, no.
- My man.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.588
And my man Mark here. He's all right, too.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.353
Not only that,
but homeboy can bust a hell of a rhyme.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.272
Jiggly titties, you got that jiggly titties.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.191
- Stupid.
- Okay.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.910
No, but seriously, dog.
Whatever you need, it's covered. Deal?

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.633
Deal.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.390
- Those guys right there?
- Yeah.

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.872
No problem, man. I got you.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.239
Hey, fellows.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.109
- Okay, got to go.
- Have you had work done?

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.838
See you first thing tomorrow morning, Docs.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.832
Serpentine, serpentine.
I voted for Obama.

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:50.711
Oh, my God.
There's the girl of my dreams, right there.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.349
Yo, E-dog, watch me work my magic.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.835
Stupid.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.192
All right,
