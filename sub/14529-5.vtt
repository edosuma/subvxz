(Rudy Giuliani)
From a lawyer's point of view,

02:51.843 --> 02:53.909
it's a terrible mistake
to put a Mafia member

02:53.911 --> 02:55.443
on the witness stand.

02:55.445 --> 02:57.745
Because they think
they're very smart,

as the lawyer.

02:59.515 --> 03:01.314

they can get away with

03:01.316 --> 03:03.816

in life, which is to charm.

there was a guy
right outside the door.

the police department,
