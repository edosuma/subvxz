00:05.239 --> 00:10.309
(traffic whooshing)
(people chattering)

00:14.081 --> 00:16.148
- [Jean Baptiste] The
colours in which we love

00:17.284 --> 00:18.217
are here.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.486
There

00:22.289 --> 00:25.257
and everywhere.

(eerie whooshing)

03:30.010 --> 03:32.744
(gentle music)

04:15.589 --> 04:18.423
- [Sistine] An ember
sparked will softly glow

04:18.425 --> 04:21.026
and fed by fuel will grow and
grow.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.396
I once was cinder sparked by
you.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.065
First timid till the flames then
grew.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.903
And so our start with touch of
dawn

04:31.905 --> 04:34.306
with amber hue for I was drawn

04:34.975 --> 04:37.609
to eyes so welcoming and warm.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.847
I never guessed you'd do me
harm,

04:41.849 --> 04:44.549
like morning glory, love in
June.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.585
The rapture of mid-afternoon.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.355
Romance of which the ancients
wrote,

04:50.357 --> 04:52.357
our passion had no antidote.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.927
And with the dusk, though
scarlet tinged,

04:57.698 --> 04:59.765
our love began to come unhinged.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.036
For clouds arrived which filled
your eyes,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.606
extinguishing bright twilight
skies.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.910
With cold of night came shadows
pall,

05:11.912 --> 05:13.812
And I could not tear down your
wall.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.683
By midnight's hour, the fire was
dead,

05:18.719 --> 05:21.019
mere ashes smouldered in its
stead.

05:22.323 --> 05:27.392
You left, and should you
reappear, I vow to shun you.

05:28.028 --> 05:32.097
Now I fear the very
thing for which I yearn,

05:33.400 --> 05:36.668
one touch and then again,

05:36.670 --> 05:37.602
to burn.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.723
(Woman sighs)

06:01.095 --> 06:05.030

06:05.032 --> 06:09.034

06:33.894 --> 06:37.896
(speaking in foreign language)

06:42.202 --> 06:45.137
(laugh nervously)

06:48.742 --> 06:50.075
- [Jean Baptiste] Find me

06:50.076 --> 06:51.409
where the summer breeze is
sighing.

06:54.415 --> 06:58.817
There, time floats me in its
endless sea,

06:58.819 --> 07:02.621
engulfed I am by sweet
tranquillity.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.560
On a lovely esplanade gulls
flying,

07:08.562 --> 07:11.630
a trailing clouds through
azure, wheeling free.

07:14.435 --> 07:18.937
Sun flashes gold its grin,
there you'll find me.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.241
(Soft, intense music)

07:45.098 --> 07:50.168
(happy, gentle music)
(people chattering)

08:37.784 --> 08:40.318
(upbeat music)

09:32.673 --> 09:34.973
- [Jean Baptiste] When loves
comes pounding on a drum

09:34.975 --> 09:38.209
it comes on hard and fast and
strong

09:39.212 --> 09:42.113
until two hearts in
sync beat passions song.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.350
- [Sistine] Sometimes love
comes clanging down the tracks.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.686
It clashes or it clamours to be
heard.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.056
So as it crosses, meaning it's
obscured.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.225
- [Jean Baptiste] Other times
loves lurks or it attacks.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.697
Unrequited love can pierce or
burn

09:58.699 --> 10:00.799
until it's ventricle turns into
black.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.270
- [Sistine] And then our
times love gently climbs

10:05.272 --> 10:07.772
or eases sure-footed to one's
door

10:08.642 --> 10:11.943
or sweetly seeps the saturated
soul.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.413
- [Jean Baptiste] It's
strong and yet it's soft.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.684
It doesn't sting or snip.

10:21.688 --> 10:22.687
It listens.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.958
And reverberates the
whispers of the heart.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.833
- [Sistine] To hear the surf,

10:34.835 --> 10:37.669
of trill of spring's new birds.

10:37.671 --> 10:41.006
The cat's soft purr or
strong and stirring words.

10:41.842 --> 10:45.143
Endearments whispered,
songs so cute I grin.

10:46.146 --> 10:50.081
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

10:50.083 --> 10:54.119
To see the sun, full
and gorgeous on the sea.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.788
An unexpected rainbow over me.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.792
A moving scene, glad faces of my
kin.

11:02.095 --> 11:06.231
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.768
To smell a rose, sweet lavender
in bloom.

11:09.770 --> 11:13.104
Popcorn at the movies, favourite
perfume.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.209
Aroma of Mum's cooking once
again.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.846
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.117
To taste delicious food when out
to dine.

11:26.987 --> 11:31.156
Ice cream on my tongue,
a lover's mouth on mine.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.094
Cold drinks, desserts
as chocolatey as sin.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.065
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

11:41.435 --> 11:46.071
I feel a gentle rain,
snowflakes on my nose,

11:47.074 --> 11:51.976
ocean's breeze, the tides,
the sand between my toes.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.381
(Gentle music)

13:07.521 --> 13:12.590
(gentle music)
(people chattering)

14:00.173 --> 14:03.241
(people chattering)

14:40.947 --> 14:44.082
- [Sistine] The place in
which my parents fell in love,

14:44.084 --> 14:48.086
how I got my name, the
chapel they did meet.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.956
And forever was never the same.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.362
(People chattering)

15:09.943 --> 15:10.642
(footsteps tapping)

15:10.644 --> 15:13.478

15:14.314 --> 15:17.382
(people chattering)

15:32.999 --> 15:34.465
(children chattering)

15:34.467 --> 15:38.102
[Sistine] Such contemplating
that the poets do.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.438
They sing of God, our spirits to
renew.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.142
With Mother Nature often
there in their tune

15:45.045 --> 15:48.246
and offer up their verses
to the sun and moon.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.383
They praise the sunset over the
blue lake,

15:53.219 --> 15:56.721
while pondering man's
purpose as they ache.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.691
They ache for all that earth can
never be.

16:00.727 --> 16:04.462
Through dreams they've
lost and for humanity.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.733
And when they ache their
words are filled with pain.

16:10.070 --> 16:14.172
Which pour out from their
soul like cleansing rain.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.755
(Traffic whooshing)

16:47.307 --> 16:50.375
(people chattering)

17:00.020 --> 17:02.720

18:15.295 --> 18:17.829
(gentle music)

18:39.486 --> 18:40.818
(slow piano music)

18:40.820 --> 18:45.423
- [Jean Baptiste] An ember
sparked will softly glow

18:45.425 --> 18:47.592
and fed by fuel will grow and
grow.

18:49.863 --> 18:54.465
I once was cinder sparked
by you, first timid.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.668
Till the flames then grew.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.639
(Gentle music)

19:01.641 --> 19:05.209
And so I start with touch
of down with amber hue.

19:05.211 --> 19:08.446
For I was drawn to eyes
so welcoming and warm.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.384
I never guessed you'd do me
harm.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.189
Like morning glory, love in
June.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.528

19:46.452 --> 19:48.352

19:48.354 --> 19:50.788
For clouds arrived,
which filled your eyes.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.359
Extinguishing great twilight
skies.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.398
With cold of night became
shadows pall.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.736
And I could not tear down your
wall.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.842
By midnight's hour the fire was
dead.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.014
Mere ashes smouldered in its

20:21.721 --> 20:22.653
You left,

20:25.291 --> 20:27.858
And should you reappear I vow to

20:31.364 --> 20:34.265
Now I fear the very

20:35.902 --> 20:36.867
One touch,

20:40.873 --> 20:42.306
and then again.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.410
The burn

20:46.412 --> 20:48.980
(gentle music)

21:08.534 --> 21:11.068
- [Sistine] An ember
sparked will softly glow

21:11.070 --> 21:13.037
and fed by fuel will grow and
grow.

21:14.307 --> 21:17.575

21:35.862 --> 21:37.895
The rapture of mid-afternoon.

For clouds arrived which filled

You left and should you

22:15.902 --> 22:17.501
I vow to shun you.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.806
Now I fear the very
thing for which I yearn,

22:23.376 --> 22:26.477
one touch and then again,

22:26.479 --> 22:27.578
to burn.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.581
(Slow piano music)

22:57.944 --> 23:00.678
An empty field left open and
inviting,

23:01.681 --> 23:04.482
somewhere for us to be we find
exciting.

23:05.818 --> 23:09.186
Unlocked and open, the birth of
freedom.

23:09.188 --> 23:12.189
(Slow piano music)

24:14.720 --> 24:16.220
- [Jean Baptiste] How could I
not follow,

24:16.222 --> 24:17.855
an angel is Sistine.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.126
How calm she is.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.096
How comforting.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.668
On the other side of my own
fence,

24:30.670 --> 24:32.670
she's the grass most coveted in
green.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.948
- [Sistine] In spite of everything with which I'm dealing,

24:44.817 --> 24:47.551
how strangely wonderful I am
feeling.

24:48.554 --> 24:53.624
To find this man in all of
London, seeming so like me,

24:54.994 --> 24:58.596
that deep connection, instant
chemistry.

24:59.499 --> 25:03.234
A stranger, yet a kindred
spirit in his eyes I see.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.304
I lead, he follows.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.306
He doesn't question anything I
say.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.843
His fingers lightly graze my
skin.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.112
Our fingers interlock.

25:15.982 --> 25:19.884
Kindred souls, we sleep inside
the car,

25:20.686 --> 25:23.254
then waken to embrace a
brand-new day.

25:24.757 --> 25:29.193
We drive, we walk, we
have no need to talk,

25:30.663 --> 25:31.996
we simply feel.

25:33.065 --> 25:37.568
Jean Baptiste, there are no
words to say.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.571
(Slow piano music)

25:55.087 --> 25:57.087
(sigh)

26:07.266 --> 26:09.266

(doors closing)

29:41.147 --> 29:44.214
(birds chirping)

29:44.216 --> 29:47.351
At the end of the rainbow,
dreams unfold.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.120
And some people say
there is a pot of gold.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.990
How well I recall a rainbow one
day,

29:52.992 --> 29:56.226
that shone in the sky
when a storm went away.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.496
Rain pelted my car, I felt so
afraid,

29:59.498 --> 30:02.266
but as I neared home it started
to fade.

30:02.268 --> 30:06.069
The sky once so dark
grew more and more blue,

30:06.071 --> 30:10.374
I thrilled next to see
a rainbow arch through.

30:10.376 --> 30:13.944
It bent over towards the
mountains so beautiful.

30:13.946 --> 30:17.181
A peace and great joy
welled up inside my soul.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.084
No pot of gold at the end did I
see.

30:21.086 --> 30:24.054
But still there was
gold and it beckoned me.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.925
The mountains were
gilded with bright gleam.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.494
This is magic that makes poets
dream.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.531
When I got home I took paper to
pen

30:34.533 --> 30:37.601
and wrote of that beauty,
God's promise to men.

30:38.537 --> 30:43.607
Again, I recall how my soul
lifted at the rainbow's end,

30:44.076 --> 30:46.243
God's love gifted.

dance we were all born to do.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.702
The style to choose
from are more than few.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.355
(People chattering)

32:54.356 --> 32:57.007
Some choose simple two-step,
some move with flair.

32:59.578 --> 33:03.280
Some slow dance, some break
dance, devil may care.

33:05.017 --> 33:10.087
Some freestyle, while
others just dance on cue.

33:12.257 --> 33:17.327
Some tango with zest,
some shuffle soft shoe.

33:19.999 --> 33:23.533
Others glide easily, waltzing on
through.

33:25.337 --> 33:30.374
Some change their partners,
some stay one pair.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.678
Life is a dance.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.650
You start with the styles
in your own milieu.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.689
Then grow as you add
on new moves you view.

33:47.693 --> 33:52.562
You stumble (laughs) but
sometimes dance on sweet air,

33:53.732 --> 33:56.666
just keep the beat.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.504
Try new steps if you dare.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.841
The way you end up is all up to
you.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.248
Life is a dance.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.585

should do.

38:49.795 --> 38:54.864
(wind whispering)
(birds chirping)

39:10.782 --> 39:12.515
- [Jean Baptiste] At
last you've come for me,

39:12.517 --> 39:15.018
my love, my sweet.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.456
You've come through tranquil
woodland

39:19.458 --> 39:23.526
with the breeze along that
path where once we used to meet

39:23.528 --> 39:25.995
and with the sunlight
streaming through the trees.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.668
With passion in your
eyes and wings for feet,

39:31.670 --> 39:35.839
you've come for me and
all my anguish please.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.744
You are so near.

39:43.615 --> 39:44.981
I hear your wild heartbeat.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.419
You've come for me.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.556
My own wild heart to seize.

39:56.628 --> 39:57.560
Alas,

40:00.799 --> 40:02.165
the woods have vanished

40:02.166 --> 40:03.532
with the gleam of my waking
dawn.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.773
It was but a dream.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.715
(Tranquil music)

44:27.732 --> 44:30.433
(birds chirping)

45:20.118 --> 45:22.385
(laughing)

46:16.207 --> 46:21.144
To hear the surf or trill
of spring's new birds,

46:21.146 --> 46:25.782
the cat's soft purr or
strong and stirring words,

46:25.784 --> 46:29.819
endearments whispered,
songs so cute I grin.

46:29.821 --> 46:32.355
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

46:32.357 --> 46:35.424
To see the sun fall gorgeous on
the sea.

46:36.961 --> 46:39.162
An unexpected rainbow over me.

46:39.164 --> 46:43.166
A morning scene, glad faces of
my kin.

46:44.135 --> 46:47.236
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

46:48.339 --> 46:52.108
To smell a rose, sweet lavender
in bloom.

46:53.011 --> 46:55.912
Popcorn at the movies, favourite
perfume.

46:56.581 --> 46:59.448
Aroma of Mum's cooking once
again.

46:59.450 --> 47:01.617
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

47:02.554 --> 47:05.855
To taste delicious food when out
to dine.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.826
Ice cream on my tongue.

47:09.828 --> 47:11.561
A lover's mouth on mine.

47:11.563 --> 47:15.464
Cold drinks, desserts
as chocolatey as sin.

47:16.267 --> 47:18.901
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

47:19.904 --> 47:24.974
To feel a gentle rain,
snowflakes on my nose,

47:25.443 --> 47:28.411
oceans breeze, the tides,

47:29.447 --> 47:31.113
the sand between my toes.

47:34.052 --> 47:35.151
The sun's warmth.

47:36.654 --> 47:39.222
The heat of passion on my skin.

47:39.224 --> 47:41.958
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.660
To feel inside me such a happy
glow

47:44.662 --> 47:48.364
that it radiates to everyone I
know.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.566
The love that lets me
know life is win-win.

47:52.303 --> 47:55.104
My heart sings out as joy wells
up within.

47:55.106 --> 47:57.874
- [Sistine] Yes, love is even
truer

47:57.876 --> 48:00.676
when we see past the
frailties accepting all.

48:01.613 --> 48:05.147
Our dog and cat friends
don't mind if we have flaws.

48:05.149 --> 48:07.683
Real love means breaking down
the walls.

48:08.686 --> 48:11.621
The friends who we hold
close to us are those

48:11.623 --> 48:13.890
who love us as we are.

48:14.926 --> 48:19.495
But there is too a love that
happens, suddenly and grows.

48:19.497 --> 48:22.598
Dawn overtaking night
as it bursts through.

48:24.135 --> 48:27.303
Love's every colour ought to
offer peace,

48:27.305 --> 48:31.440
like lover's sweethearts
or of a man and a wife.

48:31.442 --> 48:34.977
But even those desires we know
most cease,

48:34.979 --> 48:38.147
are unexpected sunbursts in our
life.

48:39.684 --> 48:43.552
- [Jean Baptiste] Sistine, I
thank you for your gifts to me.

48:45.056 --> 48:49.659
I needed some assurance and
in that way uniquely yours,

48:50.929 --> 48:52.194
you showed me what to do.

48:54.933 --> 48:57.133
You helped me to escape
predictability.

48:59.737 --> 49:02.104
If not for you, I'd
have not been set free.

49:05.176 --> 49:09.712
My simple gift, Sistine,
is a red rose for you.

49:14.385 --> 49:17.253
(Wind whooshing)

49:21.059 --> 49:26.128
(birds chirping)
(engine revving)

49:30.635 --> 49:33.536
- [Sistine] He shines like
silver moonlight moon,

49:33.538 --> 49:36.605
cool marble statue, this tycoon.

49:36.607 --> 49:39.442
And though he makes the ladies
swoon,

49:39.444 --> 49:42.311
of ice he's hewed, of ice he's
hew.

49:43.081 --> 49:46.983
He's poker faced and
can deceive competitors

49:46.985 --> 49:49.385
and can achieve most anything.

49:49.387 --> 49:52.722
But can't conceive of
Genevieve, of Genevieve.

49:53.558 --> 49:56.459
Like Neptune, distant from the
Sun,

49:56.461 --> 49:58.728
relationships he chose to shun.

49:59.630 --> 50:02.565
He thought the search for love
was done.

50:02.567 --> 50:05.668
He has no one, he has no one.

50:06.604 --> 50:09.739
Now, love's allure has come his
way.

50:10.675 --> 50:12.375
What will he do?

50:12.377 --> 50:14.176
What will he say?

50:14.178 --> 50:16.679
Will he grab hold, beg love to
stay?

50:16.681 --> 50:20.783
Or let it stray, or let it
stray?

50:22.353 --> 50:24.720
This dragoness disguised in
lace,

50:25.623 --> 50:28.691
passion's flower, with angel's
face.

50:28.693 --> 50:31.560
Precisely picks the time and
place,

50:31.562 --> 50:34.830
each dream to chase, each dream
to chase.

50:35.767 --> 50:39.702
Like ink, the colour red
she stains the hearts

50:39.704 --> 50:42.071
of those whose love she drains.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.542
And then she leaves with nought
remains,

50:46.544 --> 50:49.678
no lush she feigns; no lush she
feigns.

50:51.149 --> 50:54.116
And now there's one who would
suffice

50:54.786 --> 50:58.687
for him alone she'd
sacrifice, her everything.

51:00.391 --> 51:04.760
So he of ice she must
entice, she must entice.

51:06.364 --> 51:08.597
So Genevieve now strikes the
flame,

51:09.734 --> 51:11.767
will man of ice his love
proclaim.

51:12.870 --> 51:15.671
Beneath her fire and his cold
frame,

51:16.774 --> 51:20.076
they're both the same,
they're both the same.

51:20.878 --> 51:24.246
(Gentle sombre music)

52:16.667 --> 52:19.468
Another year has come,
chillingly,

52:19.470 --> 52:22.304
and more chillingly for me
than in decades heretofore.

52:23.174 --> 52:26.475
I watch and ranting from
my window as I recall.

52:28.179 --> 52:29.912
The year already past has tugged
me

52:29.914 --> 52:32.515
from those tame and toasty days

52:32.517 --> 52:34.750
when I lay face up to the sun,

52:34.752 --> 52:37.419
dreaming that my summer would
never end.

52:38.256 --> 52:40.256
It brought me to this winter,

52:40.258 --> 52:43.392
when it withered up and
died and half a century

52:43.394 --> 52:46.195
and more of memories had
fallen from me by now.

52:47.598 --> 52:50.566
Like pretty crystal flakes they
fell,

52:50.568 --> 52:52.568
drifting through my mind.

52:52.570 --> 52:55.204
Places, events and people,

52:56.274 --> 52:58.841
all those people I
looked up to in my youth,

52:58.843 --> 53:00.576
fallen as the snow.

53:01.546 --> 53:04.213
How many pretty snowflakes
have melted away.

53:05.316 --> 53:07.783
Only my memories of them remain.

53:07.785 --> 53:11.320
Memories now piled up like
snowdrifts in my brain.

53:11.956 --> 53:15.658
Yes, the newborn year has
arrived,

53:15.660 --> 53:19.461
just one month old already,
it has lost it's cruel.

53:19.463 --> 53:24.333
This infant's ageing process
paralleled on the larger scale,

53:24.335 --> 53:28.337
that fleeting span of time known
as life.

53:28.339 --> 53:31.507
A time all the living undergo.

53:33.211 --> 53:36.378
The new year carries on as must
we all.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.949
To soon complete its cycle.

53:41.285 --> 53:43.485
Let it blister, let it wail.

53:43.487 --> 53:45.387
Let it rattle at my door,

53:45.389 --> 53:48.657
for soon enough all
signs of it will cease.

53:49.694 --> 53:52.561
(Birds chirping)

55:51.148 --> 55:53.816
- [Jean Baptiste] On you the
angels did bestow a glow,

55:53.818 --> 55:56.752
your friends would come
to know as star shine.

55:59.090 --> 56:01.957
For even stars cannot
outshine your countenance.

56:03.527 --> 56:04.960
It's as divine as starlight.

56:08.466 --> 56:12.034
Oh, how you hush those stars my
dear,

56:13.003 --> 56:15.404
from brightly shining when you
are near.

56:17.742 --> 56:22.811
As starstruck, I too am
stricken by your sight.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.884
I'd love to be with you
all night to stargaze.

56:32.523 --> 56:37.593
Shine on sweet man, but do
not burn to long or strongly.

56:41.665 --> 56:44.566
The stars might turn to
stardust.

56:44.568 --> 56:47.035
(Eerie music)

57:03.020 --> 57:05.921
(eerie whooshing)

57:10.928 --> 57:15.998
(bells tolling)
(eerie whispering)

57:21.705 --> 57:26.775
- [Woman] Tried you a few
times but, I can't get through.

57:27.044 --> 57:32.114
(Eerie whispering)
(bells tolling)

57:40.224 --> 57:43.559
(dramatic whooshing)

58:16.193 --> 58:21.263
(gentle music)
(bells ringing)

58:43.153 --> 58:47.289
- [Jean-Baptiste] It hovers
here, the moon opaque,

58:47.291 --> 58:49.091
obscuring mountain trails I
take.

58:51.962 --> 58:53.595
No other living things appear.

58:55.165 --> 58:59.535
A moon opaque, it hovers here.

59:02.773 --> 59:04.773
I follow, along a ledge.

59:05.943 --> 59:07.809
Below a swirling river's edge.

59:10.981 --> 59:14.149
In front of me, the canyon's
yawn.

59:17.154 --> 59:18.720
Along a ledge, I follow on.

59:22.660 --> 59:24.760
I see no hue when fog congeals.

59:25.896 --> 59:29.298
Oh, doom of one who no more
feels.

59:33.604 --> 59:38.106
The moon has fled and so have
you.

59:42.112 --> 59:44.913
When fog congeals I see no hue.

59:46.784 --> 59:50.385
Now all is dim, it matters not.

59:54.158 --> 59:56.058
My dear one's heart, I have not
got.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.664
No use in living without him.

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.034
It matters not.

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:08.804
Now all is dim.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:14.242
At peace I'll be if I should
fall

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:16.912
to murky water from this wall.

01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:21.083
Oh, yawning canyon, swallow me.

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:28.256
If I should fall,

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.662
at peace I'll be.

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:37.399
(Bright music)

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:48.043
- [Sistine] It hovers
here, the moon opaque,

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:51.346
obscuring mountain trails I
take.

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:54.416
No other living thing appear.

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:57.052
A moon opaque, it hovers here.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.355
I follow, along a ledge.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.291
Below a swirling river edge.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:06.261
In front of me, the canyon's
yawn.

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:08.730
Along a ledge, I follow on.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.300
I see no hue when fog congeals.

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:16.705
Oh, doom of one who no more
feels.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:19.474
The moon has fled and so have
you.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:23.345
When fog congeals I see no hue.

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:27.215
Now all is dim, it matters not.

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:32.020
My dear one's heart, I have not
got.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.456
No use in living without him.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:37.159
It matters not.

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:38.460
Now all is dim.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:43.298
At peace I'll be if I should
fall

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.934
to murky water from this wall.

01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:48.336
Oh, yawning canyon, swallow me.

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:53.075
If I should fall, At peace I'll
be.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.746
(Dramatic music)

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.909
(eerie whooshing)

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:31.346
(dramatic music)

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:11.279
(dramatic music)

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:21.590
(blow thuds)
(Jean-Baptiste groans)

01:04:21.592 --> 01:04:24.159
(people chattering)

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:26.461
- [Sistine] He wanted
to step up and be a man.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.497
He didn't realise he didn't have
too.

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.901
His mind filled with such
fantasy,

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:37.606
when all he needed was self-respect for the things he has.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:43.578
A punch, a hit of realisation.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.115
He needed to reassure
himself of his choice,

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:51.019
his need to further his life
and not live in fantasy.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:53.989
This man, this Buck,

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:59.261
this threatening figure
imposing opposition

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:00.929
to his need for escape.

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:10.071
(Wind whooshing)

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:20.615
(Jean-Baptiste sighs)

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:23.251
(eerie music)

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:29.591
(birds chirping)

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.499
(gentle sombre music)

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:30.552
Words I've never spoken,
are those I'll never write,

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:35.557
like words I might recall,
the glow I felt when night,

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:39.627
one choice, lifetime's
fragment I took for paradise.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.498
The time for which my memory
alone could not suffice.

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:48.169
One summer's whispered
end, your feel, your touch,

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:53.241
your scent, your lashes on my
cheek, the pure enrapturement.

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:59.647
Your hands and hair like silk,
your pause to gaze on me,

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:06.321
they seem more an illusion
now than past reality.

01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:09.591
Words I've never spoken or
those words I'll never write.

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:13.361
Like words that might recall
the glow I felt when night,

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.498
no words can bring to life
the fleeting ghost of you.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:20.802
You haunt my empty hours,
there's nothing I can do.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:25.573
For if you think of me,
I guess I'll never know.

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:29.611
And how you made me thrill
no words can ever show.

01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:34.682
Words I've never spoken
are those I'll never write,

01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:39.821
like words that might recall
the glow I felt one night.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:43.391
(Eerie music)

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:06.307
(Jean-Baptiste sighs)

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:37.738
(birds chirping)
(water gurgling)

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:13.408
(aeroplane engine buzzing)

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.531
(gentle music)

01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:43.838
(engine revving)

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:56.251
You didn't try to fix me, Jean
Baptiste.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:59.387
You let me fall into
your arms releasing pain.

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:05.293
How patient you have been, how
very sweet.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.696
A stronger woman I have become.

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:13.034
Since knowing you I've
learned to kiss the rain

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:19.340
and in my dreams, Jean-Baptiste,
I'll see you again.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.407
- [Jean Baptiste] Like
multi-colored flowers

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:54.909
in the wild love blossoms
in a vast array of hues.

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:58.346
What joy the mother feels
when her sweet child

01:11:58.348 --> 01:12:00.848
inside her arms looks up at her
and coos.

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:05.720
How necessary is this first
deep bond, to everyone.

01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:09.791
It nourishes the heart.

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:12.360
- Okay go and say hello to
mummy, go on

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.573
- Going to say hello to me.

01:12:13.574 --> 01:12:14.785
- [Jean Baptiste] For
as the child matures,

01:12:14.786 --> 01:12:15.997
he sees beyond familial bonds.

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.767
Love's landscape is our art.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:22.637
- [Man] Tell Mummy how happy
you are to have her home.

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:24.595
(Sistine laughs)

01:12:24.596 --> 01:12:26.552
- [Jean-Baptiste] In soft or
brilliant colours we choose

01:12:26.553 --> 01:12:28.509
to paint the different forms
of it that we may find.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.778
And love may be a harlot or a
saint.

01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:34.349
But when it's true,

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:38.753
it chooses to be blind.

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:44.892
- Hey, hey.
(Man laughing)

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:47.695
(both laughing)

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.871
(baby crying)
- Oh.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:01.943
What's that, being noisy.
(Sistine laughing)

01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:19.761
- [Jean Baptiste] In solitude
I watch the clear, blue sky.

01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:24.465
Leaves flutter on the grand,
majestic oak

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:25.767
beneath which I'm sitting.

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:29.003
Swallows fly around me swooping.

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:34.175
Now I hear a croak.

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:37.879
A sound that I am sure I'd never
hear

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.781
if I were on a busy city street.

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:43.518
I stand and walk around.

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:47.188
The sound is near.

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:51.826
The feeling that I get is rather
sweet

01:13:51.828 --> 01:13:54.862
and finally I spot there on the
pond,

01:13:56.699 --> 01:13:58.666
a tiny frog that's serenading
me.

01:14:07.544 --> 01:14:10.812
(People chattering)

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:12.713
- [Woman] I've been thinking
that.

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:15.750
- [Jean Baptiste] Crops
rippling in the breeze.

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:17.151
I see beyond my shaded spot.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.455
I soon must leave my tree.

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:26.027
At sunset I've watched before I
creep

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:28.563
into the quiet of night
and back home to sleep.

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:36.637
Words I've never spoken,
or those I'll never write.

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:40.875
Like words that might recall
the glow I felt one night.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.646
(Gentle music)

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.217
One choice, lifetimes
fragment I took for paradise.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:54.522
The time for which my
memory alone cannot suffice.

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:56.791
One summer's whispered end.

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:00.995
Your feel, your touch,

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:03.764
your scent.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:09.170
Your lashes on my cheek,
the pure enrapturement.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:16.644
Your hands and hair are like
silk.

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.581
Your pause to gaze on me.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:27.922
You seem more an illusion
now than past reality.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:31.626
Words I've never spoken
are those I'll never write.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.330
Like words that might recall
the glow I felt one night.

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:43.271
No words can bring to life
the fleeting ghost of you.

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:47.642
You haunt my empty hours.

01:15:48.945 --> 01:15:54.015
There's nothing I can do
for if you think of me,

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.288
I guess I'll never know

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:03.858
and how you made me thrill
now words can ever show.

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.169
- [Sistine] He saw what he
wanted to see,

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:17.305
these men his ultimate enemy.

01:16:18.308 --> 01:16:20.007
For they were not there for me.

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:26.914
This man, singular, I hope
some forgiveness he'll give me.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:32.753
His car returned, peace, I think
he'll be.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:46.000
- So this is a new client for
our business

01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:50.137
and they are bringing a
new rebranding project

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.056
to our business.

01:16:52.057 --> 01:16:53.974
They're looking at rolling
out a very marketing brand

01:16:53.977 --> 01:16:56.711
of peace and serenity,

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.246
nice of you to join us.

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:04.218
John, this is Buck, Buck this is
John.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.155
So they're looking at a
very blended approach.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:11.359
They need strong commonsense
mind you.

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:16.130
So they've already come up
with some initial themes,

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:20.935
some of those themes,
child, dove, peace, serenity

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.906
If you come across we can talk

01:17:25.908 --> 01:17:29.110
about some of the strategies
and where they come for it.

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:30.878
Buck I would like you to
take a bit of a lead on this

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.114
- [Jean Baptiste] At peace
I'll be if I should fall,

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:35.249
to murky water from this wall.

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:40.221
Oh, yawning canyon, swallow
me, if I should fall.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.157
At peace I'll be.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:46.661
(Water gurgling eerily)

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:53.701
(woman speaking faintly)

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:56.404
(dramatic music)

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:15.690
I didn't know Sistine at all

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.291
when I first saw her
reading on the park bench.

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:21.996
How can I explain all that she's
been

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:24.231
in what were six days
of Sistine have meant.

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:28.436
We bared the purest part of
ourselves to one another.

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:32.073
Whatever happens in my
future there will be no other

01:18:32.075 --> 01:18:34.408
whom I will look back
on with such tenderness.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.746
Thank you.

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:41.348
(Gentle music)

01:18:57.366 --> 01:18:58.866
- [Woman] Hey Hon, I'm back.

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:00.735
I hope you had a few good days
without me.

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:03.537
I tried calling a few times
but I can't get through.

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:06.107
I hope it's okay I called your
work phone.

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:07.458
Look, I've been thinking

01:19:07.459 --> 01:19:08.808
that the Courtyard is
gonna be fully booked

01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:10.411
for months on end

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:13.214
and so I think we should
take the Ivy while we can.

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:14.915
Dad said he'd front the deposit

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.118
so at least we know that
the reception will be shared

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.953
with all our friends.

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:21.222
Also, you need to get fitted for
your tux,

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:22.957
so let me know and I'll arrange
for you.

01:19:22.959 --> 01:19:25.493
Oh, and the cake, decide on a
cake,

01:19:25.495 --> 01:19:27.495
will you, please (laughs).

01:19:27.497 --> 01:19:30.464
I've sent you many
photos so please decide.

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:32.967
Love ya.

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:36.036
(Slow violin music)

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.271
(woman sighs)

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:13.274
- [Sistine] Oh how I love
my time with Jean-Baptiste.

01:20:13.276 --> 01:20:18.045
An attractive man, well suited
I first could see the epitome

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:20.247
of someone regimented in his
thinking.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:26.187
But in the din of city life,
Jean Baptiste was sinking.

01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:28.889
Despite all that, I could see at
least

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:32.026
there was a spark in him, and in
a while,

01:20:32.028 --> 01:20:34.929
this man once quiet and
withdrawn,

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:37.865
brought my soul to life and made
me smile.

01:20:37.867 --> 01:20:41.435
He looked about for something
that he could not find.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.537
But it was there before him all
the time.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.342
With freedom and a
newly born tranquillity,

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.044
he found his own truth.

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:54.615
How trusting and how sweet is
he.

01:20:55.918 --> 01:20:58.185
This kindred spirit, who like
me,

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:02.456
needed comfort in our
mutual search for clarity.

01:21:03.893 --> 01:21:06.460
(Gentle music)

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:31.652
- [JeanBaptiste And Sistine]
I needed you, you needed me.

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:36.023
And when I saw your face,
tranquillity enveloped me.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.261
Thank you dear for being there.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:47.501
Thank you for your grace.

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:50.604
(Man vocalising)

01:21:50.606 --> 01:21:53.974
(intense piano music)

01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:03.417
- I love you.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.053
- No you don't.

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:11.225
I was just good for you
and you were good for me.

01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:15.629
We helped each other
realise what was important.

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:19.600
That sometimes moments of
reinvention are a good thing.

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:22.069
(Speaking in foreign language)

01:22:22.071 --> 01:22:24.438
Helps you realise who you really
are.

01:22:25.975 --> 01:22:29.310
- No.

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:32.346
Love is like a colour wheel,
Sistine.

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:37.418
The way we feel about our
family,

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:40.054
the way we feel about our
partner,

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:42.389
the way we feel lust.

01:22:44.026 --> 01:22:44.959
Monotony

01:22:46.529 --> 01:22:47.428
Passion.

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:50.531
Desire.

01:22:53.202 --> 01:22:54.468
Comfortability.

01:22:56.672 --> 01:22:58.672
Friendship, trust.

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:03.344
- To me love is not just one
thing.

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:07.581
- Different love is like
colours,

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:13.554
you and I just found the one
that matched at the right time.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.590
- In that case,

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:20.327
I love you.

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:27.234
(Upbeat music)

01:23:28.305 --> 01:23:34.654
