00:19.460 --> 00:23.169
Sarah Jean and Jacob Dawes
butchered what, 12 girls?

00:24.040 --> 00:26.782
Thirteen, counting the girl
that was just found.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.615
Hilary Dickson.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.668
Disappeared 15 years ago.

00:31.670 --> 00:34.207
Buried her
under Sarah's mother's living room.

00:34.210 --> 00:37.577
-You think that was their last victim?
-Well, that's what we're here to find out.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.992
CENTRAL FLORIDA

00:41.420 --> 00:44.571
There's nothing about the dynamics
of Sarah Jean and Jacob's relationship.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.992
The state _isn't interested
In dynamics or proﬁles.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.070
They just want this case to go away.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.457
They were caught. They confessed.
They got the death penalty.

00:51.460 --> 00:54.873
You guys do realize that visiting death
row is not part of my job description?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.029
Garcia, this will be

00:56.040 --> 00:59.168
the first serial killer couple
ever recorded for ViCAP.

00:59.170 --> 01:02.879
They slaughtered 13 young girls
with blonde hair. Hello?

01:03.210 --> 01:04.996
Sarah Jean Dawes.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.701
Media called her "The Ice Queen."

01:07.710 --> 01:10.952
That's how they interpreted
her demeanour during the trial.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.700
-You see different?
-No, I didn't say that.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.533
She killed her two-year-old son
and 12 teenage girls.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.997
She only confessed to the murder
of her son, Riley.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.878
Well, she hasn't cooperated
with any requests to interview her.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.074
Well, if she doesn't talk now,

01:23.080 --> 01:25.071
she's going to take that story with her
to "Old Sparlq."

01:34.120 --> 01:38.819
For the next 36 hours,
a guard will remain outside your cell.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.077
Your personal effects
will be along shortly.

01:43.620 --> 01:48.034
You will remain in the deathwatch cell
until the hour of execution.

01:48.750 --> 01:52.038
Your last meal cannot exceed $20.

01:54.330 --> 01:58.619
It'll be a full moon tomorrow._
Is there any chance I could see It?

01:59.170 --> 02:01.320
That's against regulations.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.667
Open on four.

02:31.540 --> 02:35.453
FLORIDA STATE PENITENTIARY

02:42.290 --> 02:43.746
Here it is.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.662
They call themselves
the Women of Jacob.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.997
-Try to look like his victims.
-Creepy.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.073
There's only 12 of them.
Should we tell them they're one short?

02:59.960 --> 03:01.245
At least.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.786
I think we'll find Hilary Dickson

03:05.790 --> 03:08.497
was by no means Jacob's last victim.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.742
"Whoso sheddeth man's blood,

04:10.080 --> 04:13.493
MONDAY, 8AM
35 Hours Remaining

04:13.500 --> 04:16.412
In 1985, there was a string of missing
girls reported in Northern Florida.

04:16.420 --> 04:17.489
COMMAND CENTER
Florida State Penitentiary

04:17.500 --> 04:20.242
Police subsequently got
an anonymous call from a woman

04:20.250 --> 04:22.320
claiming to have seen Jacob
with some of the girls.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.161
Did they ever find out
who the anonymous woman was?

04:24.170 --> 04:26.286
-No.
-Police interviewed Jacob Dawes.

04:26.290 --> 04:29.828
Also present were Sarah Jean Dawes
and their 2-year-old son, Riley.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.036
Police were suspicious.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.076
They came back three hours later
with a search warrant

04:33.080 --> 04:35.071
only to find that Riley had vanished.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.036
They also eventually found
the dismembered bodies

04:37.040 --> 04:41.204
of 12 missing girls buried in the ground
underneath Jacob's workshop.

04:41.210 --> 04:42.700
Fearing that the police were onto them,

04:42.710 --> 04:44.575
Jacob figured Riley would slow them down

04:44.580 --> 04:48.209
so he ordered Sarah Jean to kill him
and dispose of the body.

04:48.210 --> 04:50.701
Sarah confessed to killing Riley,

04:51.380 --> 04:53.826
but never admitted her role
in the deaths of the girls.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.320
Yeah, but she never denied it, either.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.537
Well, according to Jacob,
Sarah Jean was fully complicit

04:57.540 --> 05:00.418
in the targeting, abduction
and murder of all 12,

05:00.420 --> 05:01.876
and, well, now 13 victims.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.418
Prison records show
that Jacob IS a sexual psychopath.

05:05.420 --> 05:07.456
They were inconclusive
on Sarah Jean, though.

05:07.460 --> 05:10.281
They said her demeanour
was more like that of a war victim's.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.372
And as with all sexual psychopaths,

05:12.380 --> 05:16.111
Jacob is obsessed with the idea
of the total possession of his victims.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.610
He's shown no remorse or guilt.

05:17.620 --> 05:19.702
Well, Jacob saw Sarah Jean
as a possession.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.076
Somebody to control. To dominate.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.378
Just so we're clear,
they've agreed to these interviews?

05:24.380 --> 05:25.824
-Yes, sir.
-Wait. I'm sorry.

05:25.830 --> 05:27.491
-Who are you, exactly?
-I'm Sam Shapiro.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.785
I'm their appeals attorney.

05:28.790 --> 05:33.489
Not only have they agreed to them,
they were initially requested by them.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.206
Yeah, I can't get them a stay
of execution.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.872
Garcia. Remember,
75% of all communication...

05:37.880 --> 05:39.165
Is non-verbal.

05:39.170 --> 05:41.070
Hotch, interview Jacob. Morgan, Elle?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.707
I'm not going to get anything new, but...

05:42.710 --> 05:44.075
Well, find a new way to ask.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.321
696 Hennessy Street,
Jacob and Sarah Jean's home.

05:46.330 --> 05:47.706
It's due for demolition.
Take a look around.

05:47.710 --> 05:48.870
Okay.

06:05.580 --> 06:08.117
Jacob's workshop was out the back.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.874
He claimed that Sarah Jean would lure
the Victims from mall parking lots.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.783
She'd invite them to smoke pot in
her truck. They'd find Jacob but no pot.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.200
And they'd bring them here.

06:20.210 --> 06:23.168
I studied this case.
I'll never forget it.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.532
This is where the workshop stood.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.282
There was an arch, right here.

06:30.290 --> 06:33.111
He used his workspace as a torture room.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.957
The marks on the bodies matched
many of his tools.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.492
He used a bench saw to dismember
the bodies.

06:42.380 --> 06:44.166
And then he buried them under the floor.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.240
Until he ran out of room.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.030
We know that Jacob was abused as a child.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.416
What about Sarah Jean?

06:53.420 --> 06:56.378
Her mother refused to give
any testimony in her defence.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.200
She never talked to anybody.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.871
Maybe she's willing to talk now.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.246
Let's go pay Sarah Jean's mother a visit.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.992
The guards call this
dead man's alley.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.662
Has she had any contact with Jacob?

07:08.670 --> 07:11.571
Well, until today
she's declined contact with anyone.

07:11.580 --> 07:15.038
For her own safety, we keep her away
from the other prisoners.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.283
The hate for this woman is
as fresh today as it was 15 years ago.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.070
Open on four.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.206
Accomplished work.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.114
I've had plenty of time.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.246
What is it you want to know?

07:49.830 --> 07:52.037
I think it's time
the mothers of those girls learned

07:52.040 --> 07:54.417
why their children had to die.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.530
Don't you?

08:02.380 --> 08:03.574
Hello?

08:07.250 --> 08:08.786
Anybody

08:12.250 --> 08:15.071
Mrs. Mason

08:15.080 --> 08:17.708
Are you Sarah Jean Dawes' mother?

08:17.710 --> 08:19.029
Who the hell are you?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.168
FBI. We're from
the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

08:22.790 --> 08:25.281
My daughter and her son of a bitch husband

08:25.290 --> 08:28.282
buried a 13-year-old girl under my floor.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.030
What more do you need to know?

08:30.710 --> 08:32.871
Ma'am, Sarah Jean agreed to meet
with our colleagues

08:32.880 --> 08:34.871
to talk about why they killed those girls.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.418
We'd like some background
information, if you don't mind.

08:38.420 --> 08:40.320
Yeah. Come in.

08:43.330 --> 08:45.207
Extensive remodeling.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.281
Jacob built the original extension?

08:51.330 --> 08:52.740
I see he liked arches.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.116
Teenage girls is what he liked.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.411
How was Sarah Jean growing up?

08:57.420 --> 09:00.162
Fine, until she met Jacob.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.286
She was shy, quiet

09:07.790 --> 09:09.610
and oh, so smart.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.611
And her relationship with her father?

09:14.170 --> 09:15.706
Was Sarah Jean ever abused?

09:19.120 --> 09:22.999
He was strict. He was a military man.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.616
They didn't always see eye to eye.

09:26.460 --> 09:28.917
That's all history. He's dead.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.877
She's about to die.

09:35.960 --> 09:40.579
Mrs. Mason, if we better understand
the dynamics of her relationships,

09:40.580 --> 09:43.162
we can get a better idea
of why and what actually happened.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.489
Dynamics?

09:46.080 --> 09:48.992
Well, it might answer why
Jacob never killed Sarah Jean.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.956
They shared something.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.246
They shared pain.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.917
How strict was your husband?

09:58.920 --> 10:01.491
How did he discipline Sarah Jean

10:01.500 --> 10:06.199
He was a mean bastard,
but he only hurt me.

10:06.790 --> 10:10.453
-Why didn't you leave?
-Because we had no place to go.

10:10.460 --> 10:14.669
An anonymous caller tipped the police
off about Jacob. Was it you?

10:15.250 --> 10:18.378
No, but I know who it was.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.491
This came this morning.

10:34.710 --> 10:36.371
What's it say?

10:36.380 --> 10:38.701
It's a statement Of innocence.

10:44.210 --> 10:48.453
A doctor and so young.
Your mother must be very proud.

10:48.460 --> 10:51.452
Sarah Jean. Sarah Jean.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.321
You look so fine, baby cakes.

10:57.670 --> 11:00.207
This was meant to be.
Our names Will live forever.

11:00.210 --> 11:01.450
Let's go.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.280
-It's a beautiful thing.
-Let's go!

11:03.290 --> 11:05.451
It's a beautiful thing.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.911
You designed that to happen.

11:13.670 --> 11:15.490
Did you learn anything, Agent?

11:26.170 --> 11:27.569
You want to see a trick?

11:30.540 --> 11:32.030
Pick a card.

11:34.540 --> 11:36.280
You're a diagnosed psychopath.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.076
Sexual psychopath.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.747
-Now pick a card.
-How many other girls did you kill?

11:43.880 --> 11:46.496
Do you ever smile?

11:46.500 --> 11:48.912
I mean, it's hard to trust a guy
who never smiles.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.820
Are there more bodies?

11:51.460 --> 11:55.783
If I told you that,
what would I have left for myself?

11:56.500 --> 12:00.379
You can help these families get closure
before you die.

12:02.710 --> 12:08.615
Oh, pass. Come on. Just one trick.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.208
It's a good one. Pick a card.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.612
Come on. Just one card.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.821
So what did you see in Jacob?

12:21.420 --> 12:23.661
-Freedom.
-Freedom from what?

12:30.290 --> 12:31.780
-Ga_rcia.
-Hey, it's Elle.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.075
-Hey, Elle.
-I need Gideon, please.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.820
Yeah. Yeah, I'll patch you through.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.491
Gideon? It's Elle. She says it's urgent.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.660
We're at the mother's house.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.740
She gave me a letter
I want to read to you.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.109
-Read the letter, Elle.
-What?

12:48.120 --> 12:50.111
"Mom, I know how difficult this must be."

12:50.120 --> 12:51.951
"...difficult this must be."

12:51.960 --> 12:53.996
"Things between us
were never what they should be..."

12:54.000 --> 12:55.319
"...between a mother and her daughter."

12:55.330 --> 12:56.456
That is a private letter.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.200
"I want you to know
that the best part of me,

12:58.210 --> 12:59.529
"the most important part of me..."

12:59.540 --> 13:02.327
"...is now in a better place than you
or I will ever be."

13:02.330 --> 13:03.877
-Stop it!
-"I am responsible..."

13:03.880 --> 13:05.416
"...for the deaths of those girls.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.741
"I neglected my duty
as a woman and as a mother."

13:08.960 --> 13:10.996
-Stop it.
-Take it easy.

13:19.170 --> 13:22.822
You neglected your duty?
That doesn't make you responsible.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.661
You didn't kill those girls.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.537
Why didn't you say this in court?

13:33.830 --> 13:36.492
I knew he brought women
back to his workshop.

13:37.670 --> 13:40.286
That's a long way from knowing
he was killing them.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.571
They died as a result of my neglect.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.377
This letter suggests to me

13:53.580 --> 13:56.492
that an innocent woman
is about to be executed

13:56.500 --> 13:58.821
for crimes she did not commit.

14:07.830 --> 14:10.116
They died as a result
of my neglect.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.200
MONDAY, 9PM
24 Hours Remaining

14:11.210 --> 14:13.166
This letter suggests to me

14:13.670 --> 14:16.207
that an innocent woman
is about to be executed

14:16.210 --> 14:18.531
for crimes she did not commit.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.281
Well, I can tell you right now,
it's not enough to get a stay.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.201
You want facts? Reid.

14:24.670 --> 14:27.787
Human sexuality is a complex dynamic
of three components,

14:27.790 --> 14:30.532
biological, physiological and emotional.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.748
Jacob's needs were informed
by the emotional and sexual abuse

14:33.750 --> 14:35.320
that he received
at the hand of his mother.

14:35.330 --> 14:38.743
Long-term repetitive abuse informed
the template of his love map,

14:38.750 --> 14:42.538
something we refer to as a signature.
Jacob was an only child...

14:42.540 --> 14:44.667
Thus he was alone when the abuse occurred.

14:44.670 --> 14:49.073
So in order for him to fulfil his fantasy,
he has got to be alone with his victims.

14:49.080 --> 14:52.664
If I told you that,
what would I have left for myself?

14:53.210 --> 14:54.450
He said, "myself."

14:54.460 --> 14:57.532
If Sarah Jean was present,
it would have destroyed his fantasy.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.167
She confessed to killing her son.

14:59.170 --> 15:02.378
Yes, true, but we're also convinced
that she was the anonymous caller

15:02.380 --> 15:04.496
that made the phone call
that nailed Jacob.

15:04.500 --> 15:08.413
Guilt-ridden, filled with remorse,
she called the police.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.287
That's not the profile of
a woman who would then kill her child.

15:12.290 --> 15:14.246
-What else do you need?
-Evidence.

15:14.250 --> 15:17.037
If we prove Jacob killed Riley,
would that get a stay?

15:17.040 --> 15:18.496
Absolutely.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.668
She protects the painting.
She protects the boy.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.160
What?

15:24.750 --> 15:28.413
The paintings are a statement.
We need to figure out what they say.

15:33.960 --> 15:38.112
Tension is mounting here as the
FBI'S BAU team presence means

15:38.120 --> 15:41.283
that they are conducting
a series of deathbed interviews

15:41.290 --> 15:43.872
in an attempt to find
if there are any more victims.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.202
Now, it is rumored
they are calling for a stay of execution.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.826
-Who the hell told them that?
-It doesn't matter.

15:49.830 --> 15:51.741
I don't see Hotch getting anything
out of Jacob.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.242
...for both condemned inmates
up until the very last minute.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.070
-The last second.
-Thank you, Lara.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.286
Maybe I can help.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.782
-What are you doing?
-Just get Hotch in here.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.709
Oh, I know, I know,
one day these are going to kill me.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.957
Come on, Hotch. That was funny.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.616
And who are you?

16:29.830 --> 16:31.457
My friends call me JJ.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.496
-Well. ..
-Sit down.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.779
Sit down!

16:36.880 --> 16:39.747
Hello, JJ.

16:40.380 --> 16:43.531
You're not my friend.
You can call me Jennifer.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.417
Ouch.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.868
Sorry about before. You know,
breaking your ear thing and...

17:04.170 --> 17:06.206
You have a lovely smile.

17:08.170 --> 17:10.877
-Thank you.
-But you don't smile much.

17:13.210 --> 17:14.780
Neither do you.

17:15.170 --> 17:16.956
What's your excuse?

17:18.290 --> 17:20.326
I took the liberty
of getting these from your cell.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.241
No, those are private.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.245
Thank you.

17:30.330 --> 17:32.571
Riley running free.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.288
The river. Flowing positive energy, maybe.

17:42.790 --> 17:46.169
Twelve roses.
One for each girl Jacob killed.

17:47.830 --> 17:52.199
Twelve. Not 13. We found number 13.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.372
You didn't know about her.

17:55.380 --> 17:56.950
You didn't really know about any of them.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.746
I never said I did.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.327
That was a nice touch,
bringing in the hottie.

18:05.620 --> 18:09.454
You really want to know
if there was others, don't you?

18:09.460 --> 18:12.611
I tell you what. Draw poker.

18:13.330 --> 18:17.243
-You win, I'll give you another girl.
-So there are more?

18:17.250 --> 18:19.878
-Do we have a bet

18:24.380 --> 18:28.111
I get to smell Jennifer's hair.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.667
-No.
-Oh, come on.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.911
All she has to do is lean over
and I get to smell her hair.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.319
No!

18:35.670 --> 18:38.616
-I thought you wanted answers.
-Go to hell.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.666
It's okay, Hotch.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.704
You see that? "It's okay, Hotch."

18:49.460 --> 18:51.166
Come on.

18:55.620 --> 18:58.999
JJ deals. You think I'd let you deal
from your own deck?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.457
You confessed to killing Riley.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.168
Why would you lie
about killing your own son?

19:16.170 --> 19:17.819
I didn't.

19:17.830 --> 19:19.821
Well, where's the body?

19:22.250 --> 19:25.378
-Do you have any children?
-That's irrelevant.

19:26.420 --> 19:29.207
Do you carry pictures of your children,
Agent Gideon?

19:29.210 --> 19:31.747
-We're getting off point.
-Are we?

19:33.120 --> 19:37.568
You know how long it's been since
I could actually play with someone?

19:37.960 --> 19:40.110
All I've had is solitaire.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.706
Cards?
-Two.

19:52.460 --> 19:54.496
I think I'll play these.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.201
How old would your son be now?

20:04.670 --> 20:07.742
Seventeen?
Imagine what he could have become.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.207
Jacob put an end to any chance of that.

20:14.250 --> 20:17.538
Does the strain of your work
affect your marriage?

20:18.420 --> 20:20.957
-I'm not married.
-You wear a ring.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.782
Why would you still be protecting Jacob?

20:27.790 --> 20:31.453
Did you divorce because of putting
people like me away?

20:31.830 --> 20:33.878
I think you're innocent.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.661
We're all guilty of something.

20:38.330 --> 20:43.495
But it's our children that suffers
for our sins, isn't it?

20:46.380 --> 20:48.280
You'd have to ask him.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.286
How old is he?

20:52.920 --> 20:54.410
-He's 25.
-Oh!

20:56.330 --> 20:59.413
-Do you have a picture of him?
-In my office.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.991
-You don't carry him with you?
-No.

21:04.380 --> 21:05.995
To protect him.

21:07.750 --> 21:12.323
You want to leave him somewhere safe.
Somewhere clean.

21:14.460 --> 21:17.076
You killed Riley
to protect him from Jacob?

21:17.080 --> 21:19.822
I protect my son as you protect yours.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.490
Where's he buried?

21:22.500 --> 21:25.071
All that matters is that he's safe.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.287
-Where is he?
-He's in a better place.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.741
The chaplain's here to see you.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.202
What do you got?
-I got aces and eights. Two pair.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.280
The dead man's hand.

21:48.920 --> 21:52.708
I should have had that,
but then, of course, I would have lost.

21:52.710 --> 21:55.918
Straight to the jack.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.914
And unless the rules of poker
have changed since I've been in here,

22:00.920 --> 22:02.569
you lose.

22:04.790 --> 22:08.749
Oh, sorry. Full house. Aces over eights.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.069
Man,

22:14.750 --> 22:17.822
it would have been so nice.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.959
But to answer your question,
there are no other bodies.

22:31.420 --> 22:32.956
JJ.

22:36.210 --> 22:38.872
The Governor's just granted a stay
of execution to Sarah Jean.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.780
What? They can't do that.

22:40.790 --> 22:44.248
-They don't believe she killed your son.
-She killed him.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.491
I can tell you exactly where he's buried.

22:50.710 --> 22:53.702
It's got to be here.
Jacob built this gazebo.

22:53.710 --> 22:56.110
We've searched everywhere else.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.287
The workshop and extension
in Deb Mason's house had arches.

23:02.290 --> 23:05.418
I know he had to have built this one
for Riley.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.450
Hey, got something here.

23:26.790 --> 23:28.872
Guys, the body's ID's coming through.

23:28.880 --> 23:29.869
TUESDAY, 1PM
8 Hours Remaining

23:38.620 --> 23:40.167
It's not Riley Dawes.

23:40.170 --> 23:43.662
It's Ashley Farley.
She was 14 when she was killed.

23:43.670 --> 23:45.820
Why would Jacob give us another victim?

23:45.830 --> 23:49.414
It completely goes against his need
for power, manipulation and control.

23:49.420 --> 23:52.492
Taking the secret of an old victim
to his grave satisfies that need.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.240
Why give it up

23:54.250 --> 23:57.378
Sarah Jean's the payoff.
Sarah Jean will be his last victim.

23:57.380 --> 23:59.530
That'd be the ultimate of control.

23:59.540 --> 24:00.746
Gideon, check this out.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.036
Guess who used to be
the Farleys' house cleaner?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.322
My last supper. Like some?

24:20.750 --> 24:23.036
Look, came with a toy.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.950
-May I sit down?
-Please.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.576
Ashley Farley.

24:34.580 --> 24:37.492
You cleaned her parents' house. Remember?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.371
Fondly.

24:40.290 --> 24:43.578
We found her buried
beneath a children's gazebo.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.538
At another house Jacob renovated.
He put her there.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.243
I might as well have brought her home
to that bastard.

24:52.460 --> 24:53.916
Thanks, Doc.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.662
You lied to me. It wasn't Riley.

24:58.670 --> 25:01.412
-It wasn't?
-But she was 14 years old.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.241
Oh, and really pretty.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.377
How many others are there?

25:09.710 --> 25:13.168
I only have a few hours left and,
though I like you,

25:13.170 --> 25:16.162
and I do like you,

25:17.460 --> 25:19.530
I'd like to be alone now.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.616
Good meeting you, Hotch.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.451
-I'm not done yet.
-Oh, me neither.

25:39.960 --> 25:43.373
The high reeds. The river.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.283
This here, what is this, a basket?

25:52.670 --> 25:55.377
The boy in that painting is what, 10?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.324
Maybe more.

26:00.290 --> 26:03.202
Is that how you see him, or how he is?

26:04.670 --> 26:06.956
I only have a few hours left.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.662
I'm respectfully asking you to leave.

26:11.330 --> 26:14.709
Where is he

26:17.670 --> 26:19.456
Please see Agent Gideon out.

26:19.460 --> 26:20.825
Open four.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.616
Garcia, pull up the interview
with Sarah Jean.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.668
What is it?
-Exodus 2:3.

26:40.670 --> 26:42.035
Moses?

26:42.040 --> 26:44.326
Hebrew sons were supposed to be drowned.

26:44.710 --> 26:47.952
Moses' mother sent him down the Nile
in a basket.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.746
Where's he buried?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.786
All that matters is that he's safe.

26:52.460 --> 26:55.167
-Where is he?
-He's in a better place.

26:57.380 --> 26:59.826
Jacob didn't bury Riley anywhere.

27:00.420 --> 27:02.376
Sarah Jean had already taken care of him.

27:02.380 --> 27:03.745
Then she did kill him.

27:03.750 --> 27:07.072
No, she sent him somewhere
where she believed he'd be safe.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.616
He's alive.

27:11.620 --> 27:13.781
We're running out of time.

27:14.380 --> 27:16.701
This is the proof we need
to save Sarah Jean.

27:37.830 --> 27:41.163
Check all police and hospital records
dating back to September, 1990.

27:41.170 --> 27:43.240
You know, you should check
local newspapers, too.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.241
See if anyone reported
any abandoned babies.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.115
Yeah, I don't give a damn
where the Governor is.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.327
We may have found proof
that Sarah Jean is innocent.

27:49.330 --> 27:53.073
She really only had a maximum
of three hours between police visits.

27:53.670 --> 27:56.070
00 p.m.,
so traffic was pretty heaw.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.911
Whatever she did with Riley,
it had to be local.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.161
1990. Three babies were abandoned
in September.

28:00.170 --> 28:01.910
Two-year-old boys?

28:04.330 --> 28:05.661
None.

28:05.670 --> 28:07.661
Why doesn't she just tell us
where Riley is?

28:07.670 --> 28:09.615
She'll protect him
for as long as Jacob is alive.

28:09.620 --> 28:11.918
Look, they're being executed
within an hour of each other.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.740
What hope do we even have
of finding him in time?

28:13.750 --> 28:16.287
You know, it's quite possible she
doesn't even know where he is anyway.

28:16.290 --> 28:19.669
No. She'd know.
We've got to get into her cell.

28:27.670 --> 28:29.956
You come to see the show?

28:31.250 --> 28:33.320
We need to get into Sarah Jean's cell.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.457
-I believe the proof we...
-I can't do that.

28:35.460 --> 28:38.532
All official lines of communication
are now over.

28:38.540 --> 28:40.667
-I just need five minutes.
-Agent,

28:41.210 --> 28:44.702
they want the memory
of these two individuals erased.

28:49.620 --> 28:52.202
Five minutes. That's all I need.

28:53.380 --> 28:54.529
-Five minutes.
-Thank you.

28:54.540 --> 28:55.950
Come on.

29:01.830 --> 29:06.073
-I thought it was against regulations.
-Well, don't tell anybody.

29:09.580 --> 29:10.956
It's cold.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.531
You need a jacket.
Vincent, give me your jacket.

29:14.540 --> 29:19.660
Oh, no. I'm fine, really.
It makes me feel, you know, alive.

29:45.120 --> 29:48.374
-How are your sons, Warden?
-Well, they're good.

29:48.380 --> 29:49.745
Good.

29:49.750 --> 29:52.036
-Darren just graduated.
-Yeah?

29:53.420 --> 29:56.708
Did you ever tell them
about the man in the moon?

29:57.080 --> 29:58.286
Sure.

29:58.710 --> 30:00.530
I used to tell Riley

30:01.580 --> 30:03.912
that no matter where we were,

30:04.290 --> 30:07.327
the man in the moon
would be looking down on both of us.

30:47.210 --> 30:48.996
We should get back.

30:50.500 --> 30:55.278
Sarah, if there's something you know
that can save you...

30:55.290 --> 30:57.110
Thank you, Warden.

30:59.170 --> 31:01.536
This has been wonderful.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.037
Your kindness to me... I thank you.

31:09.880 --> 31:14.499
That's Riley. That's her son. Isn't it?
Someone tell me it's him, please.

31:16.540 --> 31:20.613
JJ, circulate this photo to the press.
See if anybody recognizes this boy.

31:20.620 --> 31:22.167
Do I say who we think he is?

31:22.170 --> 31:24.035
No, just put him out as a Missing Persons.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.280
Okay.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.030
What does that mean?

31:28.040 --> 31:31.669
It means Jacob is being moved
to the execution chamber.

31:35.330 --> 31:39.539
Sarah Jean! I'll be waiting for you.

31:40.290 --> 31:43.453
Do you wish to make your peace
with God, Jacob?

31:45.710 --> 31:50.830
I've made my peace 18 times,
and each one was prettier than him.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.531
Why take them with you, Jacob?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.490
You know why.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.416
Take him down.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.668
If you don't mind, gentlemen,

32:03.080 --> 32:05.913
this is one walk I can make myself.

32:17.580 --> 32:20.378
He's just confessed
to killing four more girls.

32:20.380 --> 32:22.450
There's nothing I can do.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.116
Are you ready, Sarah Jean?

32:49.710 --> 32:52.247
Going to ride the lightning, baby!

33:09.290 --> 33:12.874
She cut around the photo
so no one can read the text.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.030
He was two when he disappeared.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.746
This boy's 16 or 17.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.911
If it's Riley,
it would mean it's a recent photo.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.205
Once Jacob's dead,

33:20.210 --> 33:22.781
you think Sarah Jean will tell us
if this is Riley?

34:16.790 --> 34:18.371
Any last words?

34:20.460 --> 34:21.916
Bring it on.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.456
Riley.

34:35.580 --> 34:36.956
You lose.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.410
No!

35:16.500 --> 35:18.070
Jacob is gone.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.662
He's no longer any threat to Riley.

35:23.460 --> 35:27.669
Tell me where he is.
We can stop this madness.

35:28.380 --> 35:32.373
There is no greater gift in life
than that of being a parent.

35:35.250 --> 35:38.492
Yet so many of us abuse
and squander that gift.

35:39.580 --> 35:41.662
You can change that right now.

35:41.670 --> 35:44.070
I made my decision 15 years ago.

35:44.790 --> 35:47.247
This has never been about Jacob.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.911
It's always been about Riley.

35:50.420 --> 35:52.240
That's why I can't let you do this.

35:52.250 --> 35:55.413
-This isn't about you or me.
-I know it isn't.

35:56.540 --> 35:58.110
That's why I'm not going to let Riley lose

35:58.120 --> 35:59.826
the greatest gift he never knew he had.

35:59.830 --> 36:03.414
But that is my gift to him.
And I'll not let you destroy that.

36:06.380 --> 36:08.325
The only people Jacob allowed
Sarah Jean to know

36:08.330 --> 36:09.615
were the families she cleaned for.

36:09.620 --> 36:10.917
Sarah Jean worked for wealthy families,

36:10.920 --> 36:12.114
all of whom lived in Hampton.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.076
Let's go over all the families
in the state of Florida

36:14.080 --> 36:15.490
who were looking to adopt in 1990

36:15.500 --> 36:16.740
and let's see how many lived in Hampton.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.615
Families looking to adopt? Hundreds.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.576
-How many from Hampton?
-Three families.

36:20.580 --> 36:23.117
The Jameses, the Kopples
and the Sheffields.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.372
Looks like the Sheffields removed
themselves from the list

36:25.380 --> 36:27.701
in October 1990
and then moved out of Hampton.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.951
That's one month after Riley vanished.
Where'd they go?

36:29.960 --> 36:31.780
Keystone Heights.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.418
We got a match on the photo.
It was in the local daily news.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.412
Call Morgan and Elle.
Tell them to get to the Sheffield house.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.705
Byron Sheffield.

36:39.210 --> 36:42.373
"Local cello prodigy,
17-year-old Byron Sheffield,

36:42.380 --> 36:44.166
"won a scholarship to play cello."

36:48.670 --> 36:50.991
-How many miles to Keystone Heights?
-Way too many.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.319
We're never going to make it in time.

36:52.330 --> 36:53.877
Not if you keep running your mouth.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.201
Well, you better buckle up.

36:59.830 --> 37:02.879
We found him, Warden Diehl.
We found her son.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.202
Unless I _receive an official
stay of execution from the Governor,

37:06.210 --> 37:08.326
I am duty-bound to see this through.

37:08.330 --> 37:10.207
My son is dead, Agent Gideon.

37:10.210 --> 37:12.451
I have agents on the way
to his house as we speak,

37:12.460 --> 37:13.825
and the Governor is standing by.

37:13.830 --> 37:17.914
-Why can you not accept the truth?
-I can. This isn't it.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.327
My agents are within minutes of finding
her son alive.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.826
I am truly sorry.

37:29.460 --> 37:30.870
Hold here.

37:35.580 --> 37:38.162
What wouldn't you do for your son
to give him a life

37:38.170 --> 37:39.910
you could never hope to dream of?

37:42.290 --> 37:44.667
I am at peace in the knowledge

37:45.750 --> 37:49.242
that my son is free to be
whatever he chooses to be.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.570
If he knew who you were,

37:54.500 --> 37:57.242
do you think he'd choose to allow you
to walk in there?

37:58.710 --> 38:01.167
If he knew who his parents were,

38:02.880 --> 38:06.418
can you imagine the damage
my legacy would leave him?

38:07.620 --> 38:10.202
Can you imagine what he would feel

38:10.830 --> 38:14.038
knowing his mother spent 15 years
on death row,

38:14.380 --> 38:18.749
innocent of all charges,
just so he could be free of her?

38:18.750 --> 38:20.035
Not me.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.069
Jacob.

38:23.710 --> 38:28.875
It isn't just my life you have
in your hands, it's Riley's life, too.

38:31.170 --> 38:34.662
You have the chance to save my son's life.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.201
I choose to save yours, too.

38:39.710 --> 38:42.281
My life ended the day I met Jacob.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.496
Garcia. We made it.

38:54.670 --> 38:58.288
Hello

38:58.580 --> 39:00.992
Garcia, tell Gideon we're here.

39:01.420 --> 39:05.163
Yeah, but I'm afraid nobody else is.
Garcia, patch us through.

39:05.170 --> 39:06.319
Gideon, I've got Elle.

39:06.330 --> 39:08.707
She says they're at the Sheffield house.

39:08.710 --> 39:10.325
It's time.

39:10.330 --> 39:12.457
Take your hands off her.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.996
Tell Morgan to kick the door down
if he has to.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.207
Morgan, you're gonna get in the house,
whatever it takes.

39:16.210 --> 39:17.495
FBI!

39:17.500 --> 39:19.616
-I said take your hands off her.
-Agent Gideon.

39:19.620 --> 39:21.030
A few moments, please.

39:24.620 --> 39:25.917
FBI!

39:28.040 --> 39:29.371
Morgan.

39:40.290 --> 39:43.453
Just stay in the car. Can I help you?

39:43.460 --> 39:45.109
Frank Sheffield?

39:45.620 --> 39:48.168
-What is this about?
-This is about your son.

39:48.170 --> 39:49.569
My son.

39:52.830 --> 39:55.116
Is that your son in the car?

39:55.960 --> 39:59.248
I don't understand.
What is this about? Tell me.

39:59.620 --> 40:02.032
-We're federal agents.
-Hey, Hotch.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.167
We got him. He's here. What do we do?

40:04.170 --> 40:07.037
Gideon, they've got him.
What are we doing here, Gideon?

40:07.040 --> 40:10.168
I am standing here
because of choices I made.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.877
Don't let my son be Jacob's last victim.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.919
Let me go. Let us both go.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.319
Tell Morgan

40:56.210 --> 40:57.916
it's not her son.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.951
That we made a mistake.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.205
Let him go. It's not the boy.

41:06.790 --> 41:08.326
Hey, Derek.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.666
Wait there, sir.

41:28.460 --> 41:32.328
Mr. Sheffield, I'm very sorry.
We have the wrong house.

41:34.460 --> 41:36.917
I apologize for any inconvenience.

41:40.330 --> 41:41.536
Agent?

41:46.750 --> 41:48.115
Thank you.

42:11.290 --> 42:14.782
Would it be too much to ask
if yours is the last face I see?

43:53.540 --> 43:55.076
Albert Pine said,

43:55.080 --> 43:58.208
"What we do for ourselves dies with us.

43:58.210 --> 44:02.658
"What we do for others and the world
remains and is immortal."
