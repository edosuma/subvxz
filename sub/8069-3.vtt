01:05.933 --> 01:06.867
Shh!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.636
Why are you trying to work?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.338
- So, what did they do?
- Shhh.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.305
Don't shhh me.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.847
Oh, wel,, I'm not interested
either, but it's my job.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.084
Darlene, what is your problem?

01:24.118 --> 01:25.186
I'm hungry.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.520
Well, dinner ain't ready yet?

01:26.554 --> 01:27.688
Well, I'm hungry now.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.423
Well, here, start on this.

01:29.457 --> 01:32.460
I hear fleece is
very high in fiber.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.828
Mommy, [inaudible].

01:34.862 --> 01:36.297
Hit it, partner.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.566
Doesn't anyone want
to hear about my day?

01:38.599 --> 01:39.933
No.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.835
Good parenting.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.704
Where are the cookies?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.406
Probably under your bed.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.376
Oh, yeah.

01:48.409 --> 01:52.012
Hello, my mom would
like to talk to you.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.282
Good afternoon, This

01:57.285 --> 01:59.387
Hey, babe, how's it going?

01:59.420 --> 02:00.888
BOTH: Death.

02:00.921 --> 02:01.889
Getting there.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.891
Hey, I may not have to.

02:03.924 --> 02:04.792
Remember bond assessment?

02:04.825 --> 02:05.693
Yeah, sure.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.595
Paul.
- Phil.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.398
He worked over there at
Garvin meat packing plant,

02:10.431 --> 02:12.433
and he got me an interview
for a job tomorrow.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.835
Yeah, what do you
know about packing meat?

02:14.868 --> 02:18.306
Well, I've been living with
a rump roast for 15 years.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.141
Make sure to put
that on your resume.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.110
Yeah, so they need
somebody to start right away,

02:23.143 --> 02:24.978
so I'm going to go meet
with the manager tomorrow.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.314
Great.
Hey, get this.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.082
I actually had to turn down
a job today, you believe it?

02:29.116 --> 02:30.984
Gee, Dan, tell
me about your day.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.186
I'm serious.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.322
The driveway job
over at Old Oaks?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.890
We're too busy.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.227
Too busy, regular good shot.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.028
Yeah.

Uncooked meat.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.341
Eat.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.476
Uh, and I was just wormed.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.612
I can't believe it, I can't
do anything right any more.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.980
Yeah, I know, babe.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.183
You know, this might be time

03:03.217 --> 03:05.853
[phone ringing]

03:06.854 --> 03:07.855
Hello.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.258
Hey, Beckers, what's up?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.359
Becky wants to
know if she can go

03:11.392 --> 03:13.026
over to Dianne's after school.

03:13.060 --> 03:13.927
It is after school.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.329
Where is she now?

03:15.363 --> 03:16.297
Where are you now?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.130
Dianne's.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.836
Hey, Becky, you were supposed
to go to the store for me

03:22.870 --> 03:24.972
after school today.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.875
Yeah, I was on
the phone all day.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.043
Well, you want your own phone,
you got to buy your own house.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.782
Yeah, you might as well
eat over a Dianne's.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.117
Call us when you're
done, we'll pick you up.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.185
Have fun, bye.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.654
Who wants to have
dinner at Wagon Train?

03:40.688 --> 03:42.423
Yes, daddy!

03:42.456 --> 03:43.757
We're going for
dinner at Wagon Train?

03:43.791 --> 03:44.925
You bet we are.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.026
Settle up, pard.

03:46.059 --> 03:46.927
Why are we going out?

03:46.960 --> 03:47.961
The can opener broken?

03:47.995 --> 03:51.832
Ha, ha, no fooling
you, young 'uns.

[music playing]

03:59.473 --> 04:00.808
They bound to tell
you what kind of job

04:00.841 --> 04:01.909
you're interviewing for?

04:01.942 --> 04:03.844
Well, alls I know is
I have my own chair.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.649
OK, do this.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.521
Shake your head.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.725
OK, now do this.

04:20.227 --> 04:23.531
JACKIE: You'll be
in the [inaudible]..

04:23.564 --> 04:26.834
Oh, you're gonna wow 'em, sis.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.438
Oh, they're not
going to hire me.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.005
They're going to hire
some little chicky

04:32.039 --> 04:34.107
with a tight skirt and
a loose everything else.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.210
Now, stop!

04:37.244 --> 04:41.114
I'm gonna be selling magazines
'til they put me in my grave.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.917
I'm gonna be cremated with back
issues of "Field and Stream".

04:46.587 --> 04:48.822
You wanna get cremated too?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.090
(ANGRILY) I don't know!

04:50.123 --> 04:53.060
Do we have to talk about it now?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.395
Can just get a minute?

04:54.428 --> 04:55.295
Yeah.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.530
OK.

04:56.564 --> 05:00.401
Roseanne, you're making too
big of a deal out of it.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.903
It's just a job.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.137
You know when I go
on an interview,

05:04.171 --> 05:05.773
I don't get dressed
up on purpose.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.410
It just makes you more nervous
and you start to sweat.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.545
Then you start worrying that
you're sweating too much.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.980
So you sit there real
stiff, because you're

05:13.013 --> 05:14.247
afraid if you lift
your arms, you have

05:14.281 --> 05:16.950
these great big pit stains.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.019
And then you that acid
feeling in your stomach,

05:19.052 --> 05:20.287
like if you open
your mouth to talk,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.189
you're going to belch, so.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.292
Whenever I go on an
interview, I just go as me!

05:25.325 --> 05:26.627
That's why you work in a bar.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.601
Jackie!

05:33.634 --> 05:35.936
Jackie, you're blocking me.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.772
In what sense?

05:38.806 --> 05:41.742
In a Plymouth sense.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.444
I'll meet you out front.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.478
What are you doing home?

05:44.512 --> 05:45.479
Oh, we tore that driveway.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.280
Knocked off early.
Oh, hey.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.716
I got that Old Oaks job.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.017
I subcontracted it.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.153
Oh, that's great Dan.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.455
Well.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.355
Wish me luck.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.390
Good luck.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.826
Where you going?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.260
[roseanne scoffs]
What?

06:00.293 --> 06:01.194
[roseanne scoffs]

06:01.228 --> 06:03.497
(YELLS) What!

06:03.531 --> 06:04.765
(ANGRILY) How can
you live with me

06:04.798 --> 06:06.166
and not know where I'm going?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.168
And, now, didn't we lay
in bed for two hours

06:08.201 --> 06:10.237
last night talking about
how important this was!

06:10.270 --> 06:12.640
And now you're saying
where are you going?

06:12.673 --> 06:13.641
Forgive me.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.276
I'm the worst husband
who ever lived.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.277
Enough about you.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.178
Now, how do I look?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.980
You look fine.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.249
Could you maybe be a little
bit more specific, Dan?

06:22.282 --> 06:25.252
I mean, this is
really important.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.888
You look extremely fine.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.923
Would you hire me in this?

06:29.957 --> 06:32.860
If I wasn't married,
I'd hire you in a minute.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.028
Yeah, so I look cheap, right?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.964
Oh, no!

06:36.997 --> 06:38.932
You're talking top dollar.

06:38.966 --> 06:39.833
[car horn honks]

06:39.867 --> 06:40.868
One second!

06:40.901 --> 06:41.769
Ah!

06:41.802 --> 06:42.970
Don't flatten it!

06:43.003 --> 06:45.172
It took me and Jackie an
hour to get it like this!

06:45.205 --> 06:46.073
Roseanne!

06:46.106 --> 06:47.274
Would you relax?

06:47.307 --> 06:49.109
Everything's going to be fine!

06:49.142 --> 06:50.343
And even if things
don't turn out,

06:50.377 --> 06:51.945
remember you're
still 50-50 partner

06:51.979 --> 06:52.880
at Four Aces Construction.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.214
And I have a
feeling some of them

06:54.247 --> 06:55.649
dividends are about to pay off.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.451
Oh, knock it off.
I got to go.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.652
In that outfit?

06:58.686 --> 06:59.553
It's OK.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.387
It's a joke.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.826
What if they give
me a typing test?

07:05.859 --> 07:07.461
You know how to type.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.597
But I'm really slow.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.464
How tough can it be?

07:10.498 --> 07:11.765
They're short words.

07:11.799 --> 07:15.636
Steak, meat, prime, chuck.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.704
Porterhouse.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.773
That would be cruel.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.208
Roseanne, what are you doing?

07:21.241 --> 07:22.109
I'm ready!

07:22.142 --> 07:25.579
What happened to your hair?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.548
It looks a lot better.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.217
Do you care if I
just drive myself?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.185
No, however you're
more comfortable.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.120
Watch my front door.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.187
Thanks.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.789
Knock them dead, my
little London broil.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.566
Sorry it's so stuffy in here.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.768
They turn off the air
conditioning on the weekend.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.002
Oh, I'm fine.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.638
Well, I'm not.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.506
I had other things to do today.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.174
Well, why don't
you just hire me

07:54.207 --> 07:57.110
and we'll skip the interview.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.280
[sarcastic laughter]

08:00.313 --> 08:03.150
You want my opinion, you're
here for a position that

08:03.183 --> 08:05.385
doesn't even need to be filled.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.286
Well, great.

08:06.319 --> 08:10.123
Then the pressure's off.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.959
No pressure.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.127
I like you already.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.564
You drove down an alley
that's forbidden to cars,

08:16.597 --> 08:20.601
and you parked in the fire lane.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.502
The point is, you
got here on time.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.471
You know how to get things done.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.774
Well, I'm glad
I impressed you.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.876
Look, are they going
to be needing somebody?

08:28.909 --> 08:29.777
Oh, not they.

08:29.810 --> 08:30.878
Me.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.913
They're off playing
golf, or doing whatever.

08:32.946 --> 08:36.049
But I'm here as usual,
running their show.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.251
Well, can I just ask you
what position they need

08:38.285 --> 08:40.954
you to hire someone to fill?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.290
Secretary to
Mr. Ivan Pitvoris.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.892
I mean, the man doesn't
even need a secretary.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.861
He doesn't do anything.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.029
Sounds like a great job.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.135
You ever think
you might be working

08:55.168 --> 08:57.304
for a man named Pitvoris?

08:57.337 --> 09:02.375
Well, I hate to tell you the
name I had for my last boss.

09:02.409 --> 09:06.079
Being as you're unemployed,
I imagine it was pretty good.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.447
Well, I quit that job.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.083
I've never been fired
from anything in my life.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.820
Phil Green seems to
think the world of you.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.187
Yeah, Phil's great.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.188
Phil's lucky.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.857
If it weren't for
me, that man would

09:16.890 --> 09:19.793
still be on the loading dock.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.795
Well, he sure
loves working here.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.031
I mean, he goes on and on
about what a great place this

09:24.064 --> 09:25.599
is to work, really.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.368
Let me tell you
something about Phil Green.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.805
He's smoother than a
newborn baby's butt.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.007
And that wife of his.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.509
She's so perky I'd like to
drive a nail through her head.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.921
Well, I see why
you're in personnel.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.062
Did I offend you?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.930
Well, Vonda's my friend.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.298
Well, I didn't say
I didn't like her.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.499
Oh.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.068
Well, I must've taken
that nail through the head

10:01.101 --> 10:01.902
thing the wrong way.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.074
You got quite an attitude.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.876
Yeah.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.311
Yeah, I guess I do.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.212
Good.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.146
I like attitude.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.314
Sit down.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.716
What for?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.818
I mean, I'm here interviewing
for a job that doesn't exist.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.320
And I get recommended
by somebody you hate.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.522
Obviously, you're
not going to hire me.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.091
That's why you're
not in personnel.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.826
You can't read people.

10:25.859 --> 10:26.927
Well, I can read you.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.761
And you're nuts.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.300
And you're a lousy interview.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.201
Yeah.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.269
But I'm a hell of a worker.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.105
That's why I'm hiring you.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.173
Excuse me?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.442
You heard me.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.376
Really?

10:43.410 --> 10:44.277
Really.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.146
Can you start Monday?

10:46.179 --> 10:48.381
Muriel.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.983
I love you.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.185
Can I use your phone?

10:52.219 --> 10:53.086
Sure.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.454
Help yourself.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.358
I'll go get your paperwork,
and then I'll tell [inaudible]..

10:58.391 --> 11:00.761
You got it?

11:00.794 --> 11:01.762
For sure?

11:01.795 --> 11:02.662
Oh, babe!

11:02.696 --> 11:03.997
That's fantastic!

11:04.031 --> 11:05.298
No, no take your time.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.199
Yeah, baby.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.100
I love you too.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.068
Bye bye.

11:08.101 --> 11:08.969
Jackie.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.137
Yeah, what's going on?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.471
Roseanne get the job.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.940
She got the job!

11:12.973 --> 11:13.941
Oh my God!

11:13.974 --> 11:14.908
She got it!

11:14.942 --> 11:18.912
[inaudible yelling]

11:18.946 --> 11:19.880
What's going on?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.081
Your mom got the job!

11:21.114 --> 11:22.382
What job?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.117
The job!

11:24.151 --> 11:26.386
Where she went
for the interview.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.789
The personnel director's
showing her around now.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.190
You know what would
make your mom really

11:30.223 --> 11:31.124
happy when she gets back?

11:31.158 --> 11:34.027
A temple in her honor.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.029
Besides that.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.297
This place is a mess, right?

11:37.330 --> 11:38.198
Bingo.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.499
I'll get Darlene.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.834
Is Roseanne excited?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.803
Not half as excited as I am.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.004
She really needed this job.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.038
Oh, you're telling me!

11:45.072 --> 11:46.206
We've got to celebrate.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.107
Definitely.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.141
I'll get Crystal on the phone.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.509
I'll let her know
what's going on.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.711
We've got about 30 minutes
to get this house presentable.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.545
Rub a lamp.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.850
- You're mom got that job.
- Awesome!

11:56.884 --> 11:57.851
Yay!

11:57.885 --> 11:59.486
Does that mean
she's not going to be

11:59.519 --> 12:01.254
annoying people on the
phone anymore for a living?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.890
Her telephone
sales days are over.

12:02.923 --> 12:03.824
Yay!

12:03.857 --> 12:05.225
Now, let's get to it!

12:05.258 --> 12:09.196
Remember, we're just looking
for the illusion of clean.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.764
I should get Vonda
on the phone too.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.698
And I'll call Sylvia.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.900
We'll get a whole
party together.

12:12.933 --> 12:13.967
I should go to the store.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.837
I don't think dried
lentils will cut it.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.705
Crystal?
Hi, it's Jackie.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.540
Are you sitting down?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.641
No, no Crystal.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.978
Don't go get a chair.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.046
Roseanne.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.081
I need you to fill
out these three forms.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.217
You can take the yellow
booklet home with you.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.386
It explains your health
benefits, insurance,

12:33.420 --> 12:34.521
and all that other good stuff.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.422
Great.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.290
Thanks, Muriel.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.326
You might want to come in
a little early on Monday,

12:39.359 --> 12:42.830
just to familiarize
yourself with the computer.

12:42.863 --> 12:43.730
Oh, look.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.198
A microwave with its own organ.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.903
Yes, we use the Tangerine 3.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.038
It can do anything.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.172
Oh, good.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.976
Maybe it can teach me
how to use a computer.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.579
You mean, you never worked
on a computer at Wellman?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.950
I worked on my
feet at Wellman.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.717
But I can learn.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.753
Not in one day you can't.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.489
I'll come in early and
I'll stay really late.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.024
Roseanne.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.827
Everything we do
here is on computer.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.929
I need somebody to
start on Monday.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.165
I mean, our whole
inventory is computerized.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.868
Our sales, our shipping.

13:20.901 --> 13:21.869
Damn.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.671
And I sent everybody home.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.639
I'm sorry.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.842
I suppose severance
pay's out the question.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.447
- Here she comes.
- Oh!

13:34.481 --> 13:36.616
We should all hide and
jump out and yell surprise!

13:36.649 --> 13:37.617
I've always wanted to do that!

13:37.650 --> 13:38.685
Go for it!

13:38.718 --> 13:39.920
Well, I'm not going
to be the only one.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.521
Hey, Vonda and Phil.
Will you do it too?

13:41.554 --> 13:42.455
Sure!
We'll do it.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.256
- How about everyone else?
- Yeah.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.824
We're going to.
- Dan?

13:44.858 --> 13:45.725
Dan?

13:45.758 --> 13:47.027
You have my word.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.428
You think we
should have a signal?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.130
How about when
she opens the door?

13:50.163 --> 13:50.964
Perfect!

13:53.800 --> 13:54.734
What's taking her so long?

13:54.767 --> 13:56.836
She can't get your
car door closed.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.238
Now she's got it.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.873
Now she's kicking
hell out of your car.

13:59.907 --> 14:00.773
What?

14:00.807 --> 14:02.042
Here she comes everybody!

14:02.075 --> 14:03.510
Get ready!
- Darlene, Darlene!

14:03.543 --> 14:04.511
Turn off the TV!

14:04.544 --> 14:05.612
Come on, now get in the woods.

14:05.645 --> 14:06.513
Go, go!

14:06.546 --> 14:08.015
No, Dan!

14:08.048 --> 14:11.418
[commotion]

14:13.020 --> 14:15.555
Surprise!

14:15.588 --> 14:16.389
Hi, Crystal!

14:19.492 --> 14:20.460
Hip, hip!

14:20.493 --> 14:21.962
ALL: Hooray!

14:21.995 --> 14:22.930
Hip, hip!

14:22.963 --> 14:24.031
ALL: Hooray!

14:24.064 --> 14:24.932
Hip, hip!

14:24.965 --> 14:26.433
ALL: Hooray!

14:26.466 --> 14:28.335
Congratulations, babe!

14:28.368 --> 14:31.038
Oh, we got to talk.

14:31.071 --> 14:38.011
In honor of your new job, your
telephone magazine sales book.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.414
[cheering]

14:41.448 --> 14:44.351
I wish you hadn't
have done that, Dan.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.385
Nice going, sis!

14:45.418 --> 14:46.286
ALL: Rosie!

14:46.319 --> 14:47.254
Rosie!

14:47.287 --> 14:48.721
Rosie!
Rosie!

14:48.755 --> 14:49.689
Rosie!

14:49.722 --> 14:50.657
Rosie!

14:50.690 --> 14:51.558
Rosie!

14:51.591 --> 14:52.592
I hope I never get old.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.094
You already are.

14:54.127 --> 14:54.995
ALL: Rosie!

14:55.028 --> 14:55.895
Rosie!

14:55.929 --> 14:56.863
OK, OK, OK.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.231
I want to make a speech.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.599
This ought to be good.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.970
Rosie, I just want to say
that if it hadn't been for you,

15:03.003 --> 15:04.938
I would have never quit Wellman.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.941
But now me and Emilio, we
have our own little business.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.609
And we're all doing great.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.544
And we owe it all to you.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.780
I only wish there was a
way for us to thank you.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.715
Well, maybe put
me on the payroll

15:15.748 --> 15:18.618
might be a nice thing to do.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.253
[speaking spanish]

15:22.455 --> 15:23.323
Juanita!

15:23.356 --> 15:25.692
He's doing it again.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.828
Baby, you're a real hero.

15:28.861 --> 15:29.729
[applause]

15:29.762 --> 15:31.764
I didn't get the job.

15:31.798 --> 15:32.665
What?

15:32.699 --> 15:33.500
You heard me.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.872
What do you mean you
didn't get the job?

15:39.906 --> 15:40.773
Roseanne, you want a beer?

15:40.807 --> 15:42.675
Not now, Crystal.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.377
I mean, I didn't get the job.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.646
You ought to be used
to hearing that by now.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.348
So you want to get me
the barbecue started?

15:48.381 --> 15:49.449
Put on hamburgers, hot dogs.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.950
No.

15:50.984 --> 15:51.784
Something wrong?

15:56.023 --> 15:57.657
I didn't get the job.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.758
What happened?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.861
Oh, I don't want to
talk about it right now.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.230
Phil.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.665
I'd just like to thank you
for putting in a good word.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.933
Too bad I'll be
in the warehouse.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.268
I won't be able to
see that much of you.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.270
Did Muriel say when
your lunch hour is?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.538
Oh, I think it's
pretty flexible.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.809
You know, if it hadn't been
for Phil putting in a good word

16:16.843 --> 16:20.547
with Mr. Garvin, Muriel would
still be on the loading dock.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.483
Where she belongs.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.353
Oh, not now Jackie.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.687
So you didn't get this job.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.156
The right job will come along.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.657
This was the right job.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.159
Well, then you'll
get another job.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.060
No.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.161
I wanted this job.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.495
Roseanne.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.664
You being out of work right
now is not that big a deal.

16:37.697 --> 16:38.565
(YELLING) Mom?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.133
Do we have anymore chips?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.734
They're in the cupboard.

16:41.768 --> 16:42.935
(YELLING) Which cupboard?

16:42.969 --> 16:44.037
The one with the chips.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.042
My being out of work right
now is a big deal, Dan.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.211
Because I've been out
of work for four months.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.645
Roseanne, you got a minute?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.381
You know, I read your
horoscope today and it said--

16:54.414 --> 16:56.416
Not now, Crystal.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.151
You remember Rosie?

16:58.185 --> 16:59.352
Sure!

16:59.386 --> 17:01.288
How you doing, Rosie?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.223
Hi, Joe!

17:03.256 --> 17:04.857
Where's the cake?

17:04.891 --> 17:06.393
I'll go check.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.162
So tell me, how old
are you today, Rosie?

17:09.196 --> 17:12.332
Joe, I'm 35 today.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.567
I'm sorry we
didn't bring a gift.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.568
It's OK, Joe.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.271
I appreciate you coming.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.274
Roseanne, you want me to
get rid of all these people.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.376
I could do that.

17:23.410 --> 17:27.046
Roseanne, I just heard.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.083
You know, if it wasn't
for you, I would--

17:30.117 --> 17:32.885
Hold on there, Crystal.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.421
I'm sorry.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.390
But I wouldn't be my own
boss, with my own hours,

17:37.424 --> 17:39.426
and have the satisfaction
that comes from making

17:39.459 --> 17:41.794
my customers feel more
beautiful and confident

17:41.828 --> 17:45.432
with their Cindy Lou Cosmetics.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.401
And I owe it all
to you, Roseanne.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.138
You made me feel very
uncomfortable, Crystal.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.305
And I thank you.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.178
Oh, are you going to be OK?

17:58.211 --> 17:59.746
I think so.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.581
But I just don't understand,
what is wrong with you,

18:01.614 --> 18:02.482
Roseanne?

18:02.515 --> 18:06.353
Why won't anyone hire you?

18:06.386 --> 18:09.722
Don't try and
cheer me up, Crystal!

18:09.756 --> 18:11.124
Roseanne, we got to go.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.226
But I just want to thank you one
more time for getting all of us

18:13.260 --> 18:14.694
out of that hell hole.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.897
Quitting Wellman was the
best thing you ever did.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.299
Thanks Vonda.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.534
DAN: Bye, Vonda.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.771
Congratulate me and
tell me quitting my job

18:24.804 --> 18:26.439
was the best thing I ever did.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.808
It was the stupidest
thing I ever did.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.042
How can I do that?

18:30.076 --> 18:31.611
How could I quit my job?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.846
I got three kids!

18:33.880 --> 18:35.982
Some guy gives me a
little lip, and I--

18:36.015 --> 18:37.083
I tossed it off!

18:37.116 --> 18:39.586
I tossed my paycheck,
my benefits.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.488
I tossed my pension!

18:41.521 --> 18:42.955
I let him beat me.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.090
He didn't beat you.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.425
He did beat me, Dan.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.326
And you know why?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.127
Because he has a job.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.262
And you got a job.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.063
And Jackie's got a job.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.098
Vonda's got a job.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.501
And, hell, even
Crystal has a job.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.802
What do I got?

18:55.835 --> 18:57.504
I got zip.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.638
It's OK, baby.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.507
Leave it open.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.441
That's it, Dan.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.742
Just and make a joke.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.412
Roseanne can't find
a job, ha, ha, ha.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.546
What do you want me to say?

19:06.579 --> 19:10.417
Why don;t you tell me
what to do again, Dan!

19:10.450 --> 19:12.051
I didn't tell you
to quit your job.

19:12.084 --> 19:12.952
The hell you didn't!

19:12.985 --> 19:14.587
The hell I did!

19:14.621 --> 19:17.224
I told you if you wanted
to quit your job you should

19:17.257 --> 19:18.325
go ahead and quit your job.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.959
I was trying to support you.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.961
You told me to
quit my job, and now

19:21.994 --> 19:23.095
you resent me because I did!

19:23.129 --> 19:24.564
Bull, bull, bull.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.599
You're all the time picking
at me and making little cracks!

19:26.633 --> 19:28.000
We always make little cracks.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.536
We always make little jokes.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.870
That's how we are.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.374
That's why we get along so well!

19:34.407 --> 19:37.810
Oh, well, if it's so
easy for you to make jokes,

19:37.844 --> 19:39.379
when I'm the one
that's out of work,

19:39.412 --> 19:40.747
and everything's
going great for you!

19:43.816 --> 19:45.218
I'm not mad at you
for quitting your job.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.152
You're mad at you for
quitting your job.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.220
I'm mad at me for
quitting my job?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.621
You're taking it
out on me, because you

19:48.655 --> 19:50.022
think your family let you down.
- You don't know what I think.

19:50.056 --> 19:50.990
I'm sick of it!

19:51.023 --> 19:52.024
So I quit!

19:52.058 --> 19:54.227
And you think I'm
mad because I quit!

19:54.261 --> 19:55.228
Yeah.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.229
I'm mad that I quit!

19:56.263 --> 19:57.564
And where did everybody go?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.906
I'm sorry.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.341
Now, I did let my family down.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.578
And you know it, and I know it.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.645
And it hurts.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.347
It hurts real bad, Dan.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.574
Hey.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.175
What?

20:43.209 --> 20:44.043
Get a job.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.023
BECKY: Where's my history book?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.791
It's underneath the newspaper.

20:58.825 --> 20:59.692
Darlene!

20:59.726 --> 21:01.093
Get it down here!

21:01.127 --> 21:01.994
BECKY: Bye, mom.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.296
Bye, dad.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.897
Hey, I got one more pancake.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.399
I want French toast.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.867
Well, you better
move to Europe.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.104
What about your breakfast?

21:12.138 --> 21:13.740
I'll eat it on the bus.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.941
I'm gone!

21:14.974 --> 21:16.208
I'll talk to you later, baby.

21:16.242 --> 21:17.209
Hey, you forgot something.

21:17.243 --> 21:20.513
[dan laughs]

21:20.547 --> 21:21.348
I meant your lunch.

21:26.118 --> 21:26.986
Bye.

21:27.019 --> 21:27.787
Bye, mom.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.632
Good morning.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.601
This is Roseanne from the
Magazine Discount House.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.504
And since you're a
preferred customer--
