00:34.400 --> 00:35.700
Mom!

00:39.400 --> 00:41.400
Watch me!

00:42.100 --> 00:44.400
Okay, Billy!

00:49.700 --> 00:51.200
Mom!

00:51.200 --> 00:54.200
You're not watching!

01:00.200 --> 01:02.000
Mom!

01:44.600 --> 01:48.200
My little boy...
My Billy...

02:54.200 --> 02:56.700
TEN YEARS LATER

03:09.600 --> 03:11.200
Mom!

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
Hi.

03:12.500 --> 03:16.600
Josh. I was just coming in.
They know you're supposed to wait.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.000
They're looking for you.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.900
Who?
Who's looking for me?

03:21.900 --> 03:24.400
Hey, what is it?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.300
Go look, Mom.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.300
Mrs. Underwood,
we tried to call you.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.300
You must've already left.

03:46.700 --> 03:51.200
What is everyone staring at?
What is going on?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.400
My beautiful boy.

04:50.700 --> 04:54.600
<i>I'm just going to shine this
light in your eyes, okay?</i>

04:55.400 --> 04:57.900
<i>You're doing great.</i>

05:00.200 --> 05:02.800
<i>See? Nothing to it.</i>

05:07.700 --> 05:10.900
- He won't speak?
- No.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.200
- Not even to his parents.
- Are they here, his parents?

05:14.200 --> 05:17.100
Oh, they've been here
around the clock.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.700
I took his prints... It's him.

05:22.900 --> 05:26.500
Boy should be a teenager by now,
but look at him.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.600
- Explain to me how that can be.
- I can't say, Sheriff.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.500
I'm just here to find out
who took him.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.100
I talked to everyone at school...

05:35.100 --> 05:37.500
...and no one saw him
come back or how.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.000
The boy just come out
of the blue.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.700
- Are those the case files?
- Oh, yeah.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.900
Plenty more where those
came from. There's lots of files.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.900
There's just not much in them.
We never even had a suspect.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.900
Have them set them
over there, would you.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.200
<i>Set those on that table.</i>

05:54.900 --> 05:56.800
Well, what we've got
here is a...

05:56.800 --> 06:01.600
...healthy seven-year-old boy
who was born 17 years ago.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.100
And a healthy boy who
won't speak.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.000
Excuse me?
Are you finished with Billy?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.400
Mr. and Mrs. Underwood?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.200
Um, you're with the FBI...

06:11.200 --> 06:13.300
Yes. I'm Agent Scully,
and this is Agent Doggett.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.600
- We are investigating this case.
- It's a miracle, isn't it?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.300
Mrs. Underwood...

06:21.300 --> 06:24.300
...whatever your son
has been through, ...

06:24.300 --> 06:27.300
...it has somehow affected
his physical condition.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.000
So we've been told by
every doctor here.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.900
We just want to take him home.
After ten years, can we do that?

06:33.900 --> 06:35.900
Not yet.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.800
I want to talk to him first.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.300
How you doing, Billy?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.300
My name's John.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.600
I'm gonna have a seat over here,
is that okay?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.900
Is that all right?

07:05.300 --> 07:09.000
Billy, I want you to know
that you're not alone.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.600
I've talked to lots of
other boys and girls...

07:11.600 --> 07:15.100
...who've been hurt
just like you.

07:15.100 --> 07:19.600
Sometimes when they talk about it
the hurt starts to go away.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.100
You want to talk
about it, Billy?

07:29.300 --> 07:32.200
You know, maybe you think bad
things happened to you because...

07:32.200 --> 07:34.800
...you've been a bad boy...

07:34.800 --> 07:38.500
But I'm here to tell you,
that's not true.

07:38.700 --> 07:42.800
The bad guy is the one
who took you away...

07:42.800 --> 07:47.500
...and it's up to you and me
to get the bad guy.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.400
See, 'cause as big and tough
as I am, I can't do it alone.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.800
I need your help.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.800
Can you tell me about him, Billy?

07:58.600 --> 08:03.200
What's his name?
What did he look like?

08:19.100 --> 08:22.100
You remember this,
don't you, Billy?

08:26.800 --> 08:30.000
Would you like to have
that back?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.500
What is he doing?

08:35.100 --> 08:37.500
All I want is his name.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.000
Who the hell
do you think you are?

08:42.799 --> 08:45.300
He's only a little boy.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.600
Mr. Underwood...?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.900
You think this is a game?

08:55.900 --> 08:58.100
A serious game;
one we have to win.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.700
Have you really worked kid
cases before, Agent Doggett?

09:00.700 --> 09:02.100
Child abductions?

09:02.100 --> 09:04.900
I worked the child abduction
task force. I know the horror stories, ...

09:04.900 --> 09:08.300
- ...but this kid can help us.
- This isn't just a horror story.

09:08.300 --> 09:11.200
This is a biological impossibility.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.900
Well, that's your area of expertise.
I just want to put the person...

09:13.900 --> 09:17.100
...who did this out of business.
Billy just didn't show up.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.900
He got away or was let go.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.800
And if he can talk,
he can tell us by who.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.900
Or he can look at photos in the
files and point to the man...

09:22.900 --> 09:25.700
...who did this so this doesn't
happen to some other little boy.

09:25.700 --> 09:30.700
You are ignoring the fact that
he is still seven years old.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Failure to thrive.
Isn't that the term?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.600
I mean, aren't there diseases
that delay puberty and so on?

09:37.600 --> 09:41.700
I told you... he's not sick.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.100
Good.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.400
Then he can talk.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.600
We're home, honey.
Safe at home.

10:05.900 --> 10:09.400
I'm going to go pay the sitter,
Doug. You bring Billy in.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.200
Are you glad to be home, Billy?

10:21.900 --> 10:24.400
A lot's new here, son.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.900
You have a younger
brother now.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.700
Josh.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.800
See that big dog
out there with him?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.700
That's Sparky.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.400
Would you like to go
play with him?

10:47.900 --> 10:50.100
- Knock it off!
- What's the matter, Doug?

10:50.100 --> 10:52.000
I don't know.
The dog just went off...

10:52.200 --> 10:55.100
Sparky, what is wrong with you?
Come on, let's go.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.800
Honey, it's all right.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.200
He just didn't recognize you,
that's all.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
He's a nice dog, Sparky.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.500
He just doesn't realize that
you're part of the family.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.100
But you are, Billy...

11:10.100 --> 11:13.200
...and we're just so glad
that you're finally home.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.900
You going to sleep here, too?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.600
What time is it?

11:25.600 --> 11:29.400
I spoke with the doctors
who treated Billy.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.600
- I looked at his charts.
- And what, did you find something?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.300
Yes and no.

11:35.300 --> 11:39.200
What showed up is that Billy is the
same boy who was taken ten years ago.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.500
We know that.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.000
No.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.900
I mean the -same- boy.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.900
He has no cavities.
He has no tooth decay.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.800
He still has four baby
teeth that he's never lost.

11:51.800 --> 11:56.000
He had a routine blood test six
weeks before he disappeared in 1990.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.700
His cell counts, his enzymes,
his hormone levels, ...

11:59.700 --> 12:04.200
...they are all exactly the same
as they were ten years ago.

12:04.200 --> 12:09.000
- Now how can that be possible?
- It's medically impossible.

12:10.700 --> 12:14.800
So, what's the punch line?
Where are you saying he's been?

12:17.300 --> 12:20.700
There are X-File cases...

12:20.700 --> 12:23.600
...that describe similar
paranormal findings.

12:23.600 --> 12:28.100
Alien abductees who came back
with anomalous medical stats.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.800
You know, these words:
"Anomalous", "supernatural", ...

12:30.800 --> 12:32.200
"paranormal..."

12:32.200 --> 12:35.600
They purport to explain something
by not explaining it.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
It's lazy.

12:40.100 --> 12:43.900
I'm not saying that
I can explain it, Agent Doggett, ...

12:43.900 --> 12:47.900
...but this is definitely
not normal.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.100
I went back to the witnesses
at the crime scene...

12:50.100 --> 12:53.700
...the day Billy vanished,
to this guy, Ronald Purnell.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.300
He was detained,
questioned and dismissed as a suspect.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.000
- What's your interest in this guy?
- He's a high school dropout, ...

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
...convicted of possession,
arson, and shoplifting since 1990.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
These are juvenile records.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.600
These are sealed by the court,
Agent Doggett.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.600
We're not supposed
to have these.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.500
- And we're at a standstill here.
- Yeah, and you're breaking the law.

13:15.500 --> 13:20.300
Look, I want to catch this guy,
Agent Scully, whatever it takes.

13:43.800 --> 13:47.100
We love you so much, Billy.

13:48.400 --> 13:53.400
It's so good to have you back--
to be tucking you in.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
Sleep tight.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.900
<i>What is that supposed to mean?</i>

14:22.900 --> 14:25.100
<i>It means that you're blind to
what's going on here, Lisa.</i>

14:25.100 --> 14:30.400
<i>Ten years we prayed for this.
Every night we prayed to God.</i>

14:30.400 --> 14:33.100
I prayed for our son.
That is not the boy I knew, Lisa.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.300
What do you expect him to be?

14:36.800 --> 14:40.300
- They told us this will take time.
- Even Josh is afraid of him.

14:40.300 --> 14:43.900
- He is nothing to be afraid of.
- I wish I could believe that.

14:43.900 --> 14:47.400
<i>How can you sit here
and say these things to me?</i>

14:47.400 --> 14:49.600
<i>I thought this would
make us both so happy.</i>

15:25.500 --> 15:27.700
Anybody in there?

15:28.300 --> 15:30.100
Hello?

15:32.200 --> 15:34.700
Ronald Purnell?

15:54.200 --> 15:56.800
Ronald Purnell?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.200
Yeah.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.600
Can I talk to you?

16:01.600 --> 16:05.000
Can you come out,
and we can have a conversation?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.400
Is this about my probation?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.800
It's about a little boy
named Billy Underwood.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.800
You know that name?
Ring a bell?

16:20.100 --> 16:21.400
No.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.800
It does to everybody else
in this area.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.400
He vanished from a school fair
you were at ten years ago.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.000
You remember him now?

16:32.700 --> 16:35.200
Yeah. I remember him.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.800
You think he'd remember you?

16:37.800 --> 16:41.400
- Me?
- You. Your face.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.100
You're a trip, man.
You know that?

16:46.100 --> 16:49.900
This has nothing to do with you being
stoned or violating your probation.

16:49.900 --> 16:53.100
All I'm asking is that
we go see Billy.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.500
See what he says.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.300
See what he says where?

17:00.300 --> 17:04.300
Where? Wherever. Wherever you want.
I'll make sure he's there.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.500
You're not making sense, Dude.
Just leave me alone.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.700
Honey, are you here?

18:22.400 --> 18:26.000
- What?! What are you doing?!
- Joshey! Oh, my god! Are you hurt?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.200
No.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.400
- You're bleeding.
- Mom!

18:29.400 --> 18:32.500
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.700
Billy, honey what
are you doing here?

18:44.400 --> 18:47.400
Please, Billy, answer me.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.800
Just got word
back from the lab.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.300
Ran the blood twice and
no doubt about it.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.200
It's the little boy's.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.200
But I thought you
said he wasn't cut.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.700
No. You're misunderstanding.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.300
It's the other son I'mdtalking about, Billy--

19:03.300 --> 19:04.800
...the boy who was kidnapped.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.400
- That doesn't make any sense.
- No. Billy wasn't cut either.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.300
No, but he definitely
handled the knife.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.000
His prints are on it.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Where did he even get it?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.500
His father's never seen it before.
He's no hunter.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.300
Never cleaned an animal,
which is about all...

19:19.300 --> 19:24.700
...a knife like that's good for...
except for killing, of course.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.600
Well, I hate to say this...

19:29.600 --> 19:31.800
...but I think that the best
thing for Billy and his family...

19:31.800 --> 19:35.200
...is if he's removed
to an institution...

19:35.200 --> 19:38.500
...under the observation of people
who are experienced in these things.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.900
You mean, remove him?
Take him away?

19:40.900 --> 19:43.000
After all his
family's been through?

19:43.000 --> 19:46.200
This is not a normal child,
Agent Doggett, ...

19:46.200 --> 19:50.200
- ...and this is not a normal act.
- You make it sound like he's possessed.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.200
Call the exorcist.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.800
He's a kid-- a kid who's been through
who knows what kind of hell.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.300
Give him a chance.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.500
How do you know he's not trying
to communicate something?

19:59.500 --> 20:03.000
And what's the message?

20:03.500 --> 20:06.200
Yes, he's a kid,
Agent Doggett, you're right.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.800
He's a kid who materialized out
of thin air, unaged.

20:09.800 --> 20:13.700
Do you not somehow recognize
how strange this is?

20:17.400 --> 20:20.000
Did anybody notice this?
This symbol?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.400
Yeah.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.900
Yeah, I was going to mention
that to you 'cause it's...

20:27.100 --> 20:30.000
- ...kind of weird.
- Weird how?

20:30.000 --> 20:30.900
Well, like I told you, ...

20:30.900 --> 20:33.500
...we tried everything to find
that boy and who abducted him, ...

20:33.500 --> 20:35.800
...went so far as
to bring in a police psychic...

20:35.800 --> 20:39.400
...ten years back--
came up with that very same symbol.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.300
Well, how exactly did he come up with it?

20:41.300 --> 20:44.600
She. Sharon Pearl.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.300
Couldn't say how
it came to her.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.900
- I've seen this symbol before, too.
- You have?

21:05.100 --> 21:07.200
I'll be damned.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.300
We love you so much, Billy.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.900
Whatever happened...

21:19.900 --> 21:22.700
...we want to put it behind us.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.500
Be a family again.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.400
And if you could help us
to understand...

21:31.400 --> 21:35.200
...what you're going through, ...

21:35.200 --> 21:38.200
...we could move forward.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.600
No, we're just going
to go see a doctor, ...

21:47.600 --> 21:51.400
...someone you might want to talk to.
We're coming right back.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.200
Nothing's going to happen.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.200
Mommy won't let anything
happen to you.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.900
<i>Billy, I just want you
to get the help you need...</i>

22:00.900 --> 22:04.500
<i>...so we can all live here
together and be happy.</i>

22:04.500 --> 22:07.800
Okay?
Come on, sweetie.

22:39.700 --> 22:43.500
I'll take him, Doug.
If it's such a strain on you.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.400
Look, if you think a shrink
can give us some answers, fine.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.400
I just don't want this to ruin
our other son's life in any way.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
Where's Billy?

23:31.400 --> 23:33.600
Dad!

23:38.700 --> 23:40.500
I don't want no more
trouble here, Ronnie.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.600
Whatever you're doing,
you do it somewhere else.

23:42.600 --> 23:46.500
You ever get off your lazy ass
to do anything but hassle me?!

23:46.500 --> 23:47.900
Watch your mouth.

23:47.900 --> 23:50.700
I got company coming and
he won't take your lip.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.700
Who?

24:00.100 --> 24:02.900
You tell him to
stay out of my face.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.700
Get away from me.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.700
Where you going, weirdo?

24:10.700 --> 24:14.100
You steal those clothes
off a fat man? Or'd...

24:14.100 --> 24:16.000
...you just shrink? Hmm?

24:19.500 --> 24:23.500
Hey, you going to get your butt
in this trailer, traveling man?

24:27.900 --> 24:29.600
Yeah.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.600
All depends on, uh...
what you've got in mind.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.900
<i>Testing, one, two, three...</i>

25:46.400 --> 25:48.400
This is great.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.500
Now, I've got a psychic
sitting in my living room...

25:50.500 --> 25:53.300
...who's going to tell me
what's wrong with my son.

25:53.300 --> 25:56.000
I understand your misgivings,
Mr. Underwood, ...

25:56.000 --> 25:59.200
...but perhaps you can look
at this as just another avenue.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.000
An avenue to what?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.300
We're going to solve this case,
Mr. Underwood.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.000
We're going to find out
who did this to your son.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.900
And then what?
What am I left with?

26:08.900 --> 26:13.100
A kid who stabs knives into
his brother's mattress?

26:13.100 --> 26:15.300
You don't know the half of it.

26:15.300 --> 26:18.200
He gives everyone but his mother
the creeps with that stare of his.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.100
I just know that this is
going to tear you apart.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.700
It's going to tear your family apart.
And you can't let it.

26:22.700 --> 26:25.600
You've got to save them from
the damage this can do.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.700
I'll be happy to save
what I can.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.100
Come on, Josh. Let's go.

26:35.400 --> 26:39.600
- Is this going to happen?
- Shouldn't you be telling us that?

26:39.900 --> 26:42.300
You're no doubt confused,
Agent Doggett.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.800
I take psychic readings
not see through walls.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.800
Mrs. Underwood.
I'm Sharon Pearl.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.900
I consulted on your son's
disappearance back in 1990.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.900
And you're Billy?

27:14.400 --> 27:17.000
Ms. Pearl?
Are you okay?

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
There are very powerful
forces at work here.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.500
Working through this boy.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.300
Drawing him to his brother.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.800
I feel this force...

27:37.500 --> 27:40.600
I feel this force...

27:42.200 --> 27:45.800
...coming through you.

27:47.100 --> 27:51.400
You lost someone just like Billy.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.000
What's happening to her?

28:14.400 --> 28:16.000
Oh, my God.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.300
Hey, Fartknocker.

28:35.700 --> 28:38.500
Where are you going
in such a big hurry?

28:43.400 --> 28:47.200
What's the matter?
Got something in your ears?

28:47.500 --> 28:50.600
Don't .. don't touch me, Cal.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.400
Oh, listen to him.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.600
No wonder he wears them
baggy britches.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.600
Our Ronnie's a big man now.

29:04.300 --> 29:07.500
Your old lady said...

29:07.500 --> 29:10.600
...the cops came
and talked to you. Hmm?

29:16.500 --> 29:21.000
I am talking to you,
not the side of your head.

29:21.900 --> 29:24.600
Better mind your
Ps and Qs, Jones.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.500
Or I'm going to tell them
what you did to that little boy.

29:29.300 --> 29:34.300
I'm going to tell them what you
got buried out there in the woods.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.900
What's going on
with you two?

29:40.900 --> 29:42.800
Talking about cars.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.600
Well, they've got her
stabilized...

30:30.600 --> 30:33.900
...and it looks like
she's going to be okay...

30:33.900 --> 30:36.800
...if you're at all curious
about her condition.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.600
I'd be more curious
if I believed it.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.800
Believed what?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.800
The act.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.400
- You think that was an act?
- It's pretty standard fare, isn't it?

30:48.400 --> 30:51.800
Float a few choice revelations,
as if they came from on high, ...

30:51.800 --> 30:53.500
...roll around on the floor.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.100
You saw that symbol appear
on her forehead.

30:56.100 --> 31:00.700
It's a damn good trick.
Don't ask me how she does it.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.300
- Agent Scully, please.
- No. I think you want to hear this.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.400
Now listen to it backwards.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.000
<i>- When you wake...
- What was that?</i>

31:22.000 --> 31:25.100
<i>- ...you shall have...
- It's a child singing.</i>

31:25.100 --> 31:29.500
<i>- ...all the pretty little horses...
- Lyrics.</i>

31:31.600 --> 31:37.500
<i>Hush-a-bye,
don't you cry...</i>

31:37.500 --> 31:43.200
<i>...go to sleep,
little baby...</i>

31:43.200 --> 31:46.300
You hear that,
under the noise?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
- Now--
- What's he doing here?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.200
Get away from me!

32:23.000 --> 32:25.200
Ronnie, open up the car!

32:28.200 --> 32:30.200
Ronnie, stop the car!

32:30.200 --> 32:32.700
Agent Scully, he's got Billy!

32:59.300 --> 33:01.300
Get out of the car!

33:02.400 --> 33:03.800
Now!

33:07.200 --> 33:09.600
Don't move, Ronnie.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.900
Where's Billy?

33:16.100 --> 33:19.000
I thought you said
Billy was in the car?

33:19.100 --> 33:21.400
Where's Billy?

33:36.400 --> 33:39.100
I'm going to go pay.
You want anything?

33:39.300 --> 33:41.800
Josh, are you okay, buddy?

33:53.900 --> 33:56.400
Dad, can I...?

34:33.699 --> 34:35.699
Mister?

34:41.199 --> 34:42.699
Pony?

34:42.699 --> 34:44.699
Hey, pony.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.000
Hey, there you are.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.600
Help! Help!

35:21.700 --> 35:25.700
- Count to ten, Agent Doggett.
- He took Billy.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.600
He couldn't have.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.500
How are you going to back that up
with Billy now missing from his home?

35:32.500 --> 35:34.800
By the certain knowledge that
not five minutes earlier, ...

35:34.800 --> 35:37.000
...I saw him enter his
home with his mother.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.800
I saw him! I saw Billy
riding in the car with Ronnie.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.500
Why else would Ronnie
take off like he did?

35:41.500 --> 35:44.700
It's impossible, Agent Doggett,
like everything else about this case.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.800
Like how Billy can be
in his home one minute...

35:46.800 --> 35:48.600
...and then in
Ronnie's car the next.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.000
Everything about this
case is impossible.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.500
This kid is the key,
Agent Scully.

35:52.500 --> 35:56.300
I've been saying that from
the beginning and I'll say it now.

35:56.300 --> 36:00.200
Agent Doggett, Agent Scully,
I got bad news on top of worse.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.100
Josh, the Underwood's other
little boy, has disappeared.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.500
I'm not joking, not even close.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.000
I got the parents
out here now.

36:10.700 --> 36:14.400
I've got to talk to this kid,
Agent Scully.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.000
I'm absolutely sure.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.500
Have a seat, Ronnie.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.200
I know what you're
going to ask...

36:38.800 --> 36:41.300
...but I got no answer.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.000
Well, there can be
only one answer, right?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.400
I mean, why else did you
go to the house?

36:47.400 --> 36:50.700
You went there for Billy,
to get him back.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.600
No.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.600
- You had him in your car.
- I don't know how he got there.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.800
Then why go to the
house at all?

37:00.700 --> 37:04.400
Because I didn't believe you.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.600
Mom!

37:18.000 --> 37:21.600
You didn't believe what?
What's so hard to believe, Ronnie?

37:24.800 --> 37:27.900
- You said I could talk to him.
- You needed to talk to him.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.600
After all those years,
you couldn't live without him.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.800
You wanted him back.

37:32.100 --> 37:35.000
All those years, Ronnie.
All those years.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.500
Where'd you keep him?

37:46.300 --> 37:48.900
Man, you don't understand.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.000
You were sorry you let him go.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.800
No, I...

37:54.600 --> 37:57.500
I couldn't let him go.

37:58.100 --> 38:01.400
"When you wake...

38:01.400 --> 38:04.400
...you shall have...

38:04.400 --> 38:10.100
...all the pretty little horses."

38:11.900 --> 38:15.000
Who else knew about him?
Your mom?

38:15.000 --> 38:15.800
No.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.700
- Where'd you keep him?
- I didn't.

38:18.700 --> 38:22.700
- What did you do to him?!
- I didn't do anything.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.400
I took care of him.

38:32.300 --> 38:35.300
I sang to him...

38:35.700 --> 38:39.200
...you know,
so he wouldn't be afraid.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.600
Afraid of who?

38:49.600 --> 38:52.600
Who was he afraid of,
Ronnie?

38:53.100 --> 38:57.500
Somebody else involved?
Somebody else make you do it?

38:57.800 --> 38:59.700
He take that other kid, too?

38:59.700 --> 39:02.700
Billy's brother?
He take him?

39:05.200 --> 39:07.200
You're afraid of him,
too, aren't you?

39:07.200 --> 39:11.000
You're a victim, just like
those other kids. Is that right?

39:12.800 --> 39:15.800
You... me, Billy.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.800
This is our chance, man.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.300
What's his name?

39:53.700 --> 39:55.100
FBI!

39:55.100 --> 39:57.600
Cal Jeppy! Come out!

40:15.200 --> 40:17.000
It's okay, Josh.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
You're okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.600
Agent Doggett...

40:22.600 --> 40:24.500
He's on the run.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.600
He's in the woods!
Watch your fire!

40:33.600 --> 40:35.800
There may be another boy!

40:54.800 --> 40:57.000
Down on your knees!

40:57.400 --> 41:00.200
Hands in the air!
Where's the kid?!

41:00.200 --> 41:03.200
- He's in the trailer.
- Other kid!

41:03.800 --> 41:07.300
- There's no other kid.
- Billy Underwood!

41:07.900 --> 41:10.500
There's no other kid.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.100
Get this man in cuffs!
Read him his rights!

41:20.100 --> 41:21.900
The kid's over...

42:01.100 --> 42:03.200
I don't believe it.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
Okay, the clothes,
the age and condition of the bones, ...

42:08.000 --> 42:10.600
...the location of the grave.

42:10.600 --> 42:13.100
There is no doubt that that
is Billy Underwood's skeleton...

42:13.100 --> 42:16.700
- ...that is in that grave.
- We spent time with this boy.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.600
Doctors took Billy's blood.
You examined him yourself.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.100
Now, I can't accept it.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.900
I can't believe we're
asking them to.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.900
I know, but the forensic evidence
is going to come out, and what then?

42:26.900 --> 42:29.000
- What if I'm right?
- Well, what then, Agent Scully?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.900
What we do? We move on,
let it go, case closed?

42:31.900 --> 42:34.100
Look, I know where you are
with this. I have been there.

42:34.100 --> 42:36.300
I know what you're feeling--
that you've failed and that you have...

42:36.300 --> 42:40.000
...to explain this somehow.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.300
And maybe you can.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.300
Not if that's Billy's body,
I can't.

42:46.300 --> 42:49.000
But maybe that's
explanation enough.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.600
That that's not Billy's brother
lying in that grave, too.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.800
That that man who did this is never
