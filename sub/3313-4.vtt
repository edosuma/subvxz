WEBVTT

00:07.538 --> 00:08.638
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:08.639 --> 00:11.411
UGH! MAN, THAT WAS A LONG DAY.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.683
I WISH I COULD JUST FLIP
A SWITCH AND BE DRUNK.

00:13.684 --> 00:16.786
CAN YOU REACH THE TOP SHELF
WHERE THE GOOD STUFF IS?

00:16.787 --> 00:18.248
I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU OUT, BURKE,

00:18.249 --> 00:19.649
BUT I'M HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF
A PROBLEM HERE WITH MY BACK.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.651
AWW, WERE YOU SO BUSY
PATTING YOURSELF ON IT

00:21.652 --> 00:24.124
THAT YOU PULLED A MUSCLE?

00:24.125 --> 00:26.156
NO. NO.

00:26.157 --> 00:28.428
I HAD A ROUGH DATE THIS EVENING.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.629
I MET UP WITH THIS LADY,

00:29.630 --> 00:31.361
DECIDED TO TAKE IT
BACK TO HER PLACE...

00:31.362 --> 00:34.065
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT.
WHO CAN BLAME HER?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.667
SO WE DECIDED TO CRAWL
INTO THE BACKSEAT

00:37.668 --> 00:39.069
OF HER CUTE LITTLE
SPORTS COUPE...

00:39.070 --> 00:40.440
OKAY, HOLD IT. HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.611
I'M SORRY, DID I LOSE YOU?

00:41.612 --> 00:43.443
NO, JUST HOLD IT
TILL I'M TOO SLOSHED

00:43.444 --> 00:45.575
TO COMPREHEND YOUR
DISGUSTING STORY.

00:45.576 --> 00:47.717
NOTHING HAPPENED. I DIDN'T
GET ALL THE WAY IN...

00:47.718 --> 00:50.180
TO THE BACKSEAT.

00:50.181 --> 00:53.553
ANYWAY, NOW I CAN HARDLY MOVE.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.525
AND I'M PROBABLY NEVER GONNA
BE SEEING JESSICA EVER AGAIN.

00:55.526 --> 00:57.357
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE
RESEARCH IS CLEAR.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.229
THE LONGER TWO PEOPLE
WAIT TO HAVE SEX,

00:59.230 --> 01:00.760
THE STRONGER THE
RELATIONSHIP WILL BE.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.492
ACCORDING TO WHO? YOUR GRANDMA?

01:02.493 --> 01:04.294
NO.

01:04.295 --> 01:06.696
ACCORDING TO THIS NEW BOOK THAT
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT,

01:06.697 --> 01:09.239
"CLOSE YOUR LEGS,
OPEN YOUR HEART."

01:09.240 --> 01:10.701
IF THEY MAKE THAT A MOVIE,
I HOPE IT'S NOT IN 3-D.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.605
IT'S MADE ME RETHINK MY
FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS.

01:15.606 --> 01:16.846
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD TOO.

01:16.847 --> 01:18.508
DON'T YOU WANT A GIRLFRIEND?

01:18.509 --> 01:20.780
DON'T YOU WANT LOVE? DON'T
YOU WANT HAPPINESS?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.652
I JUST WANT THIS
PIERCING PAIN TO STOP.

01:22.653 --> 01:24.214
IN YOUR BACK?

01:24.215 --> 01:25.656
NO, IN MY EARS.

01:51.582 --> 01:53.643
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

01:53.644 --> 01:55.185
WAITING HERE FOR 45 MINUTES.

01:55.186 --> 01:56.516
I GOT TO TELL YOU THE
WAY YOU RUN THIS OFFICE

01:56.517 --> 01:57.547
IS AB...

01:57.548 --> 01:59.189
...SOLUTELY GORGEOUS.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.821
OH, GOOD. WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO RUN THE OFFICE

02:01.822 --> 02:03.423
MORE GORGEOUSLY.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.695
I'M SORRY. IT'S
JUST THAT I DIDN'T

02:05.696 --> 02:08.728
EXPECT THE CHIROPRACTOR
TO BE SO...

02:08.729 --> 02:10.360
YOU...

02:10.361 --> 02:12.232
HI! I'M JOE LONGO.

02:12.233 --> 02:15.605
DR. MULLINS, OR
CHELSEA, IF YOU LIKE.

02:15.606 --> 02:17.667
I DO LIKE.

02:17.668 --> 02:18.908
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BACK.

02:18.909 --> 02:21.211
- OKAY, YOU WANT ME TO SIT UP?
- YEAH, PUT YOUR LEGS HERE.

02:21.212 --> 02:23.643
- AND YOUR ELBOWS...
- OKAY.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.475
HOW'D YOU INJURE YOURSELF?

02:25.476 --> 02:28.147
HONESTLY, I WAS...

02:28.148 --> 02:30.420
TRYING TO GET SOMETHING

02:30.421 --> 02:32.582
- IN THE BACK OF A CAR.
- HMM.

02:32.583 --> 02:33.723
OKAY, I'M GONNA WRAP
MY ARMS AROUND YOU

02:33.724 --> 02:34.754
AND LAY YOU DOWN.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.855
MOST WOMEN BUY ME DINNER

02:35.856 --> 02:37.287
BEFORE THEY TRY THAT MOVE.
( chuckles )

02:37.288 --> 02:39.689
GLAD TO SEE YOU DIDN'T
HURT YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.691
YEAH, I'M NOT REALLY
EVEN HURT THAT BAD.

02:41.692 --> 02:42.792
I JUST... AHH! OH!

02:42.793 --> 02:45.195
YEAH, NO! I'M HURT. I'M HURT.

02:45.196 --> 02:47.537
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
ADJUST YOU NOW, OKAY?

02:47.538 --> 02:49.499
- SO TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
- OKAY.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.800
- HOLD IT IN.
- RIGHT.

02:50.801 --> 02:53.573
COUNT ONE, TWO, THREE.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.246
- ( back cracking )
- OH, MAYYY-YIM BIALIK!

02:56.247 --> 02:57.677
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.949
ACTUALLY...

02:59.950 --> 03:02.452
THAT WAS GREAT. I
FEEL FANTASTIC.

03:02.453 --> 03:03.813
OH, THAT WAS NOTHING.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.385
I'M NOT GETTING OFF THIS TABLE

03:05.386 --> 03:07.557
UNTIL WE HAVE YOU
IN TOTAL ALIGNMENT.

03:07.558 --> 03:08.689
BRING IT ON.

03:13.324 --> 03:14.564
LEN, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE WORKING ON

03:14.565 --> 03:15.725
A SUPERHERO SHORT STORY.

03:15.726 --> 03:16.766
AND MAKING IT ABOUT
A HOMESCHOOLED KID

03:16.767 --> 03:18.328
IS SUCH A CLEVER TWIST.

03:18.329 --> 03:19.599
OH, PLEASE. THAT'S NOT MINE.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.970
IT'S RYDER'S ENGLISH
ASSIGNMENT FOR JOE,

03:20.971 --> 03:22.672
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE.

03:22.673 --> 03:24.804
IT REALLY SUCKED ME IN.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.736
YEAH, THE SUCK PART IS RIGHT.

03:26.737 --> 03:28.207
OH, HEY, RYDER.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.509
I REALLY LIKE YOUR STORY, MAN.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.642
YOU GUYS SETTING ME UP?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.944
NO, I THINK IT WOULD MAKE
A KILLER GRAPHIC NOVEL.

03:34.945 --> 03:36.716
I MEAN, MAYBE I COULD
DO SOME SKETCHES,

03:36.717 --> 03:37.787
IF THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'D BE INTO.

03:37.788 --> 03:39.218
WAIT, WHAT?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.920
YOU WANT TO TEAM UP WITH
MY CREEPY LITTLE BROTHER?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.323
HAVE YOU BEEN HUFFING
YOUR MARKERS?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.954
YOU REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH ME?

03:44.955 --> 03:46.296
YEAH, SURE.

03:46.297 --> 03:47.557
AWESOME. ALL RIGHT.

03:47.558 --> 03:48.998
- LET ME JUST CLEAR MY CALENDAR.
- ( cellphone beeps )

03:48.999 --> 03:50.000
DONE.

03:52.403 --> 03:53.803
WE CAN START RIGHT NOW.

03:53.804 --> 03:55.505
SO HOW DO YOU SEE THIS GUY?

03:55.506 --> 03:58.538
UH, HE'S ABOUT MY HEIGHT,
MY BUILD, BROWN HAIR.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.541
SO JUST LIKE YOU EXCEPT
GIRLS GO OUT WITH HIM?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.713
MAN, YOU TOTALLY GET HIM.

04:03.714 --> 04:05.815
WOW.

04:05.816 --> 04:08.018
THE ORIGIN STORY OF THE
JUSTICE LEAGUE OF NERDS.

04:11.782 --> 04:13.383
GOD, BOYS GET EXCITED

04:13.384 --> 04:15.455
ABOUT THE MOST STUPID
AND USELESS THINGS.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.427
OOH, JACKET WITH
LOTS OF ZIPPERS!

04:17.428 --> 04:19.729
DID YOU SEE THOSE BUCKLES?

04:19.730 --> 04:20.930
THOSE BUCKLES ARE HOT.

04:20.931 --> 04:23.693
I WANT TO HAVE BABIES
WITH THOSE BUCKLES.

04:23.694 --> 04:24.964
ARE YOU GONNA BUY IT?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.566
OF COURSE I'M GONNA BUY IT.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.598
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO MY CONSTITUENTS...

04:28.599 --> 04:30.340
TO LOOK AMAZING.

04:30.341 --> 04:31.601
ADD TO CART.

04:31.602 --> 04:33.343
HELLO, LADIES.

04:33.344 --> 04:34.444
HEY.

04:34.445 --> 04:36.045
WELL, YOUR LOOK-AT-ME
WALK IS BACK.

04:36.046 --> 04:37.607
I GUESS YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

04:37.608 --> 04:39.849
YEAH, YEAH. I SAW THIS
CHIROPRACTOR, CHELSEA.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.751
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW
FANTASTIC SHE IS.

04:41.752 --> 04:44.554
ACTUALLY, UM, I CAN AND I WILL.

04:44.555 --> 04:47.717
OH, JOE MET A CUTE GIRL. I
KNOW HOW THIS ONE GOES.

04:47.718 --> 04:50.790
IT'LL BE OVER SOON... THE
RELATIONSHIP, NOT THE STORY.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.323
WHAT THE...? DID YOU SEE THAT?

04:53.324 --> 04:54.424
SHE JUST TOOK A SHOT AT ME.

04:54.425 --> 04:56.726
YEAH. SHE'S GROWING UP.

04:56.727 --> 04:59.669
SO YOU MET A CUTE CHIROPRACTOR

04:59.670 --> 05:00.730
AND YOU'RE GONNA ASK HER OUT?

05:00.731 --> 05:01.971
I ALREADY DID. WE
REALLY CONNECTED.

05:01.972 --> 05:04.834
THE FUSE HAS BEEN LIT. AND
I'M THINKING TONIGHT...

05:04.835 --> 05:06.676
JOE, THIS IS WHAT I
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

05:06.677 --> 05:08.307
YOU JUST MET THIS WOMAN.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.610
YOU KNOW, SHE CRACKS YOUR BACK,
ENDORPHINS FLOOD YOUR BRAIN,

05:10.611 --> 05:11.681
CREATING A FALSE
SENSE OF INTIMACY,

05:11.682 --> 05:13.343
AND YOU FALL FOR HER.

05:13.344 --> 05:15.785
IT'S A HORMONE RUSH
THAT YOU CAN'T RESIST.

05:15.786 --> 05:17.818
"CLOSE YOUR LEGS,"
CHAPTER THREE.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.790
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
WANTING TO BE INTIMATE

05:20.791 --> 05:22.021
WHEN YOU REALLY CONNECT
WITH SOMEBODY?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.553
DON'T YOU WANT A SHOT

05:23.554 --> 05:25.324
AT A REAL RELATIONSHIP
AND NOT JUST QUICK SEX?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.656
HEY, GIVE ME A LITTLE
CREDIT, BURKE, ALL RIGHT?

05:26.657 --> 05:29.699
SEX WITH ME IS NEVER QUICK.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.732
YEAH, I'M SURE IT'S
LONG AND DRAWN OUT.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.804
CAN'T YOU SEE HOW WAITING
MIGHT DO YOU SOME GOOD?

05:34.805 --> 05:35.666
YEAH?

05:35.667 --> 05:36.667
WELL, WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY

05:36.668 --> 05:37.807
THAT YOU REALLY CONNECT WITH,

05:37.808 --> 05:39.739
WE'LL SEE HOW GOOD
YOU ARE AT WAITING.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.970
OH, I CAN WAIT.

05:40.971 --> 05:42.842
IN FACT, I HAVE
DECIDED RIGHT NOW

05:42.843 --> 05:45.575
THAT I, TOO, WILL HOLD OFF ON
CONSUMMATING A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

05:45.576 --> 05:46.846
OH, REALLY? WITH WHO?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.718
I FOUND HIM ONLINE.

05:48.719 --> 05:50.620
HE'S ITALIAN. HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

05:50.621 --> 05:52.623
HE'S MADE FROM A COW.

05:53.724 --> 05:55.124
ALL RIGHT, I'LL JUST TELL YOU.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.527
HE'S AN EXPENSIVE
LEATHER JACKET.

05:57.528 --> 05:59.058
HOW IS BUYING A LEATHER JACKET

05:59.059 --> 06:00.790
ANYTHING LIKE HAVING SEX?

06:00.791 --> 06:02.733
WOW, YOU DO NOT
UNDERSTAND WOMEN AT ALL.

06:05.536 --> 06:09.038
COME ON IN. THIS IS, UH, ME.

06:09.039 --> 06:10.500
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

06:10.501 --> 06:11.801
I LIKE A GUY WHO'S NOT AFRAID

06:11.802 --> 06:13.503
TO SIT THROUGH A
ROMANTIC COMEDY.

06:13.504 --> 06:14.544
HEY, ARE YOU KIDDING?

06:14.545 --> 06:15.575
ROMANTIC COMEDIES HAVE TAUGHT ME

06:15.576 --> 06:16.606
A LOT OF GREAT LESSONS
OVER THE YEARS.

06:16.607 --> 06:18.648
OH, LIKE WHAT?

06:18.649 --> 06:21.080
UM. OKAY, WELL, LIKE IF, UM...

06:21.081 --> 06:22.782
IF A WOMAN IS PLAYING
WITH HER HAIR

06:22.783 --> 06:24.754
WHEN SHE'S LOOKING AT YOU,
THAT MEANS THAT SHE...

06:24.755 --> 06:26.786
THAT SHE LIKES YOU.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.087
TRUE.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.719
AND IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO IMPRESS SOMEONE,

06:29.720 --> 06:32.391
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
JUST BE YOURSELF.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.963
UNLESS YOU WEAR GLASSES.

06:33.964 --> 06:35.164
IN WHICH CASE, YOU
SHOULD GET A MAKEOVER

06:35.165 --> 06:37.026
TO A POP SONG AND
THEN BE YOURSELF.

06:37.027 --> 06:39.499
YES YES, EXACTLY EXACTLY.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.501
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
ROMANTIC COMEDIES

06:41.502 --> 06:43.633
TAUGHT ME HOW TO IDENTIFY
THE PERFECT MOMENT

06:43.634 --> 06:45.035
FOR A FIRST KISS.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.843
AND THAT WAS IT RIGHT THERE.

06:59.690 --> 07:00.690
EVERYTHING OKAY?

07:00.691 --> 07:02.622
I... I... I JUST, UM...

07:02.623 --> 07:04.694
I DON'T WANT TO RUSH THIS.

07:04.695 --> 07:06.996
I MEAN, I HAD A GREAT TIME
WITH YOU TONIGHT, CHELSEA.

07:06.997 --> 07:09.198
I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD...

07:09.199 --> 07:13.463
WE SHOULD WAIT BEFORE
WE DO ANYTHING BIG

07:13.464 --> 07:16.866
AND OPEN OUR HEARTS.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.768
( sighs ) I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

07:18.769 --> 07:20.710
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

07:20.711 --> 07:23.813
NO, I MEAN MOST GUYS RUSH
INTO THE PHYSICAL STUFF.

07:23.814 --> 07:25.845
IT'S SUCH A TURNOFF.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.847
MY LAST DATE TRIED GETTING
ME TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM

07:27.848 --> 07:29.849
IN THE BACKSEAT OF HIS CAR.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.981
MEN, HUH? ( laughs )

07:31.982 --> 07:33.783
I KNOW, RIGHT?

07:33.784 --> 07:35.785
BUT YOU'RE NOT THAT KIND OF GUY.

07:35.786 --> 07:36.986
COULDN'T BE IF I TRIED.

07:36.987 --> 07:39.589
SO I THINK

07:39.590 --> 07:42.732
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN
I TELL YOU THAT...

07:42.733 --> 07:43.963
I'M A VIRGIN.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.536
YOU'RE WHAT NOW?

07:46.797 --> 07:48.868
A VIRGIN.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.641
YOU'RE A V... ( stammering )

07:51.642 --> 07:54.504
IN WHAT SENSE?

07:54.505 --> 07:57.076
IN THE SENSE THAT I'VE NEVER...

07:57.077 --> 08:00.510
YOU KNOW, BOINKED.

08:00.511 --> 08:02.612
"BOINKED"?

08:02.613 --> 08:05.855
OH, MY GOD, YOU
REALLY ARE A VIRGIN.

08:05.856 --> 08:08.518
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S OLD-FASHIONED,

08:08.519 --> 08:09.759
BUT I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT

08:09.760 --> 08:11.621
THAT MY FIRST TIME WOULD
BE MORE MEANINGFUL

08:11.622 --> 08:13.863
IF I WAITED FOR THE PERFECT MAN.

08:13.864 --> 08:16.165
SO I HOPE YOU'RE
COOL WITH WAITING.

08:16.166 --> 08:19.599
YEAH. OF COURSE I'M
COOL WITH WAITING.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.772
I LOVE WAITING.

08:23.774 --> 08:25.075
I'M A MASTER WAITER.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.586
- HEY.
- HEY, HOW WAS THE BIG DATE?

08:36.587 --> 08:37.887
LET ME GUESS HOW
LONG YOU HELD OUT.

08:37.888 --> 08:40.590
WAS THE CAR STILL MOVING OR
DID YOU WAIT TILL IT PARKED?

08:40.591 --> 08:42.021
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.753
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,

08:43.754 --> 08:47.897
CHELSEA HAS US BOTH BEAT WHEN IT
COMES TO WAITING BECAUSE, UM...

08:47.898 --> 08:49.199
SHE IS A VIRGIN.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.563
LIKE TOTALLY?

08:53.564 --> 08:55.705
EVERYWHERE?

08:55.706 --> 08:58.668
SHE CALLED SEX "BOINKING."

08:58.669 --> 09:01.310
WOW, SHE REALLY IS A VIRGIN.

09:01.311 --> 09:04.213
WOW, I GUESS IT'S
BYE-BYE, CHELSEA, HUH?

09:04.214 --> 09:06.215
NO NO. THAT'S THE AMAZING THING.

09:06.216 --> 09:07.577
I MEAN, YEAH, WE
DIDN'T HAVE SEX,

09:07.578 --> 09:09.679
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE
TALKED AND WE TALKED.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.720
IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE
OF THE BEST DATES

09:10.721 --> 09:11.821
THAT I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

09:11.822 --> 09:13.883
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE
LIKE THE SAME MOVIES.

09:13.884 --> 09:15.284
WE FOLLOW THE SAME
TWITTER FEEDS.

09:15.285 --> 09:16.986
WE BOTH LOVE WATCHING THAT VIDEO

09:16.987 --> 09:18.788
OF THOSE PANDAS SNEEZING.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.890
UGH, I THOUGHT IT WAS GROSS
HEARING ABOUT YOUR DATES

09:20.891 --> 09:21.961
WHEN YOU DO HAVE SEX.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.292
I'M SERIOUS.

09:23.293 --> 09:24.934
LOOK, SHE IS SAVING HERSELF
UNTIL SHE FALLS IN LOVE

09:24.935 --> 09:26.195
WITH THE PERFECT GUY.

09:26.196 --> 09:28.698
I'M GONNA WAIT AROUND AND
SEE IF THAT GUY'S ME.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.199
SO IF CHELSEA AND I
DO END UP TOGETHER,

09:30.200 --> 09:31.601
I HAVE YOU TO THANK.

09:31.602 --> 09:32.843
HAPPY TO HELP.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.905
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
IT'S A 11:00 AT NIGHT.

09:35.906 --> 09:36.946
YEAH, I KNOW. I'M
GONNA GO FOR A RUN.

09:36.947 --> 09:38.778
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
SUDDENLY I JUST HAVE...

09:38.779 --> 09:39.950
I HAVE ALL THIS ENERGY.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.813
THIS IS WHAT I WAS
THINKING FOR THE COVER.

09:43.814 --> 09:45.855
SO THAT'S WHAT I'D LOOK
LIKE WITH MUSCLES.

09:45.856 --> 09:50.760
CARTOON ME IS A PLAYA'.

09:50.761 --> 09:51.891
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.322
HEY, NICE WORK ON THE
ENDING, BY THE WAY.

09:53.323 --> 09:54.593
I LOVE IT WHEN THE HERO LEARNS

09:54.594 --> 09:55.895
THAT HIS SISTER IS
THE DEVIL'S SPAWN

09:55.896 --> 09:57.627
AND HE HAS TO BEHEAD HER.

09:57.628 --> 09:59.969
JUST POPPED INTO
MY HEAD ONE NIGHT.

09:59.970 --> 10:02.872
SO WE STILL NEED A TITLE.

10:02.873 --> 10:05.805
I WAS THINKING "AT-HOME BOY."

10:05.806 --> 10:07.106
LOSE THE "AT."

10:07.107 --> 10:09.779
HOME BOY.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.180
Both: HOME BOY! YEAH.

10:11.181 --> 10:12.381
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

10:12.382 --> 10:13.683
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW HOW
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE

10:13.684 --> 10:14.684
THIS MOMENT?

10:14.685 --> 10:15.985
BARBEQUE-FLAVORED PORK RINDS.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.917
IT'S LIKE WE'RE SHARING
THE SAME BRAIN.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.389
I HAVE A STASH IN THE GARAGE.

10:20.390 --> 10:22.992
ZANDER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:22.993 --> 10:24.924
I JUST TEXT YOU AND YOU
SAID YOU WERE BUSY.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.325
I AM.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.627
I'M WORKING WITH MY BOY
RYDER ON OUR GRAPHIC NOVEL.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.059
SO YOU'RE CHOOSING TO SPEND TIME

10:30.060 --> 10:32.802
WITH MY DORKY LITTLE
BROTHER INSTEAD OF ME?

10:32.803 --> 10:34.834
YOU BETTER HAVE A VERY
GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THAT.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.837
AND I DO.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.639
BECAUSE BEING HERE
GIVES ME OPPORTUNITY

10:40.640 --> 10:44.674
TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD
TOTALLY WRITE THIS WITH US.

10:44.675 --> 10:45.975
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

10:45.976 --> 10:48.147
BECAUSE WE NEED YOU. YEAH.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.279
BECAUSE OF OUR NEED FOR YOU...

10:50.280 --> 10:53.853
A TALENTED WRITER,
WHICH YOU ARE.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.284
RIGHT?

10:55.285 --> 10:56.956
YEAH, I SUPPOSE I
COULD TAKE A LOOK.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.228
WOULD YOU? ( sighs deeply )

10:59.930 --> 11:01.731
ALL RIGHT, WELL, FIRST OFF,

11:01.732 --> 11:03.292
YOU DON'T NEED THE SIDEKICK.
HE'S STUPID.

11:03.293 --> 11:04.663
WE'RE KIND OF THINKING
THAT WE NEED HIM.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.096
- LOSE HIM!
- HE'S LOST.

11:08.939 --> 11:11.300
UM, THAT WAS MY SEAT.

11:11.301 --> 11:13.442
UH, GOOD NEWS...
THE BEST NEWS...

11:13.443 --> 11:17.046
LENNOX HAS JOINED THE
"HOME BOY" TEAM.

11:17.047 --> 11:18.247
WHEN DID WE DECIDE THIS?

11:18.248 --> 11:19.750
JUST NOW.

11:21.912 --> 11:23.913
( pants ) HEY.

11:23.914 --> 11:27.016
LOOK AT YOU RUNNING... AGAIN.

11:27.017 --> 11:29.819
SEXUAL FRUSTRATION IS DOING
WONDERS FOR YOUR CARDIO.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.891
I AM NOT FRUSTRATED.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.022
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
CHELSEA AND I HAVE HAD

11:33.023 --> 11:35.464
A GREAT WEEK OF GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED CLEAN FUN.

11:35.465 --> 11:37.827
THAT'S RIGHT. YESTERDAY
WE WENT SWIMMING.

11:37.828 --> 11:38.998
PERFECTLY INNOCENT.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.871
AND CHELSEA WORE A BIKINI THAT WAS...
THAT WAS LOVELY.

11:41.872 --> 11:43.232
AND AFTER SHE GOT
OUT OF THE WATER,

11:43.233 --> 11:45.304
SHE ASKED ME TO PUT SOME
SUNSCREEN ON HER...

11:45.305 --> 11:48.007
ON HER SUPPLE, GLISTENING
BODY, SO I DID.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.780
AND TOMORROW, WE'RE GONNA
GO TO HER TRAMPOLINE CLASS.

11:50.781 --> 11:51.911
SO I CAN WATCH HER BOUNCE.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.943
SO YOU SEE? NO FRUSTRATION HERE.

11:53.944 --> 11:55.015
( glass shatters )

11:57.017 --> 11:59.218
ALL RIGHT, I ADMIT IT.
IT'S KILLING ME.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.791
JOE, LOOK, I KNOW I
SUGGESTED WAITING,

12:01.792 --> 12:03.853
BUT I MEANT FOUR
DATES, NOT FOREVER.

12:03.854 --> 12:06.495
THIS IS CLEARLY CRUEL AND
UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT FOR YOU.

12:06.496 --> 12:08.127
YEAH, IT'S GETTING EASIER.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.899
THESE SHARDS OF GLASS IN MY HAND

12:09.900 --> 12:11.200
ARE ACTUALLY HELPING.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.933
OKAY, LOOK. YOU HAVE TO
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF

12:13.934 --> 12:15.034
AND WITH HER.

12:15.035 --> 12:18.007
IF NOT FOR YOUR SAKE, THEN
AT LEAST FOR MY GLASSWARE.

12:18.008 --> 12:19.939
ARE YOU TELLING ME TO
BREAK UP WITH A WOMAN

12:19.940 --> 12:20.970
BECAUSE SHE WON'T SLEEP WITH ME?

12:20.971 --> 12:23.012
I GUESS I AM. HUH.

12:23.013 --> 12:26.415
THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE DOUCHE BAG, HUH?

12:26.416 --> 12:28.477
YEAH? WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:28.478 --> 12:30.249
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN BECAUSE
WHAT CHELSEA AND I HAVE

12:30.250 --> 12:32.051
IS SPECIAL, ALL RIGHT? AND
I'M NOT GIVING THAT UP.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.423
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
HER BODY GLISTENS

12:34.424 --> 12:36.926
WHEN SHE GETS OUT OF THE
POOL IN SLOW MOTION.

12:36.927 --> 12:39.488
HOW DOES SHE FRIGGIN' DO THAT?

12:39.489 --> 12:41.360
YOU HAVE TO BREAK
IT OFF WITH HER

12:41.361 --> 12:43.432
BEFORE I FIND EXPLODED PIECES
OF YOU ALL OVER MY WALL.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.234
AND I JUST HAD THESE
WALLS PAINTED.

12:45.235 --> 12:46.896
WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, ALL RIGHT?

12:46.897 --> 12:48.267
BECAUSE I AM NOT
THAT KIND OF GUY.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.070
SUIT YOURSELF.

12:51.241 --> 12:53.443
I GOT TO BREAK UP WITH HER.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.209
RYDER, I REALLY LIKE
WHAT YOU DID HERE.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.011
I'M NOT SURPRISED,

13:02.012 --> 13:03.283
SINCE IT WAS YOUR SUGGESTION.

13:04.284 --> 13:08.057
WAS IT? WHO EVEN KNOWS?

13:08.058 --> 13:10.289
I DO HAVE A COUPLE
OF CONCERNS THOUGH.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.161
YOU KNOW? LIKE, IF HOME BOY

13:12.162 --> 13:13.993
CAN TURN BACK TIME
IN CHAPTER 23,

13:13.994 --> 13:15.925
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST DO THAT
IN THE FIRST CHAPTER?

13:15.926 --> 13:17.166
THEN HE WOULDN'T GET SUSPENDED.

13:17.167 --> 13:20.129
BECAUSE THEN THERE
WOULDN'T BE STORY.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.331
AND WHY IS THE SISTER
SO CONTROLLING?

13:22.332 --> 13:23.873
WELL, THIS IS SCIENCE FICTION

13:23.874 --> 13:27.136
AND IN NO WAY BASED ON
MY ACTUAL LIFE AT ALL.

13:27.137 --> 13:29.208
ZANDER, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:29.209 --> 13:31.440
IS THE SISTER TOO CONTROLLING?

13:31.441 --> 13:33.884
I THINK, UH...

13:35.886 --> 13:37.486
LENNOX MIGHT HAVE A POINT.

13:37.487 --> 13:39.488
OH, DO YOU NOW?

13:39.489 --> 13:41.590
HOW ABOUT THIS? YOU BOYS

13:41.591 --> 13:42.821
COME UP WITH A NEW ENDING

13:42.822 --> 13:44.153
AND THEN I'LL COME
BACK AND FIX IT.

13:44.154 --> 13:46.256
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

13:48.158 --> 13:50.359
DUDE, SHE IS RUINING EVERYTHING.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.461
SOMEONE'S GOT TO TELL HER
SHE'S OUT OF THE PARTNERSHIP.

13:52.462 --> 13:54.063
SHE'S NOT THAT BAD.
DIFFERENT OPINIONS

13:54.064 --> 13:55.234
ARE A PART OF THE
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.406
QUIET. HERE SHE COMES.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.238
ONE MORE THING. ZANDER,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.040
YOUR SKETCH OF HOME
BOY'S COSTUME...

14:01.041 --> 14:03.313
CAN YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE
LESS '80s CLICHE?

14:04.314 --> 14:07.346
OKAY.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.518
- SHE'S GOT TO GO.
- FINALLY.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.081
( doorbell rings )

14:13.153 --> 14:15.184
- HI.
- YOU MUST BE MEL.

14:15.185 --> 14:16.886
I'M CHELSEA, JOE'S FRIEND.

14:16.887 --> 14:18.557
OH, YOU'RE THE VIR...

14:18.558 --> 14:21.460
VERY GOOD CHIROPRACTOR.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.232
YEAH, I DON'T THINK JOE'S HOME.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.234
I KNOW. I'M MEETING HIM LATER.

14:25.235 --> 14:27.196
I ACTUALLY CAME BY TO
GIVE THESE TO YOU.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.867
OH, WELL, COME ON IN.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.240
ANYONE WITH SUGAR IS
WELCOME IN MY HOUSE.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.273
THE LEMON SQUARES ARE
JUST MY LAME EXCUSE.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.574
I CAME BY TO MEET

14:35.575 --> 14:37.476
THE OTHER WOMAN IN JOE'S LIFE.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.948
OH, I'M NOT THE OTHER WOMAN.

14:38.949 --> 14:40.349
I'VE NEVER DONE
ANYTHING WITH JOE.

14:40.350 --> 14:42.881
NEITHER HAVE I.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.513
IT'S OKAY IF I LAUGH TOO, RIGHT?

14:44.514 --> 14:46.986
- OF COURSE.
- 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE A...

14:46.987 --> 14:49.188
- YOU KNOW.
- YOU CAN SAY IT.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.190
VIRGIN. IT'S NOT A BAD WORD.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.162
WELL, IT WAS IN MY HIGH SCHOOL.

14:53.163 --> 14:56.996
LISTEN, SINCE WE'RE
BOTH KINDA CURIOUS

14:56.997 --> 14:58.197
ABOUT EACH OTHER,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.199
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU...

15:00.200 --> 15:01.230
HOW DO I DO IT?

15:01.231 --> 15:04.303
TECHNICALLY, HOW
DO YOU NOT DO IT?

15:04.304 --> 15:07.236
I JUST THINK THERE ARE MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE THAN SEX.

15:07.237 --> 15:09.939
WELL, SURE, BUT WHAT DO YOU DO

15:09.940 --> 15:12.241
WHEN YOU START FEELING LIKE...
( grunting ), YOU KNOW?

15:12.242 --> 15:15.584
'CAUSE EVENTUALLY WE ALL FEEL A LITTLE...
( grunts ), YOU KNOW?

15:15.585 --> 15:18.117
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT YOU CAN

15:18.118 --> 15:19.518
LET LOOSE THE...
( grunts ) WITH,

15:19.519 --> 15:22.051
THEN YOU FEEL SO WHOO! YOU KNOW?

15:22.052 --> 15:25.254
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
YOU DON'T HAVE THE WHOO?!

15:25.255 --> 15:27.096
I KNOW. WHOO IS NICE.

15:27.097 --> 15:28.257
NO, SERIOUSLY. I
DON'T THINK YOU DO

15:28.258 --> 15:30.059
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT EVEN
PRONOUNCING IT CORRECTLY.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.331
IT'S WHOO!

15:32.332 --> 15:35.204
WELL, I GUESS I WON'T FIND OUT
UNTIL IT'S THE RIGHT TIME.

15:35.205 --> 15:37.967
ALTHOUGH YOU DO MAKE IT
SOUND VERY APPEALING.

15:37.968 --> 15:40.170
I AM ONE OF ITS
BIGGEST PROPONENTS.

15:42.372 --> 15:45.144
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS
SO EMBARRASSING.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.615
- WHAT?
- MY FRIEND TAWNY

15:46.616 --> 15:48.647
JUST POSTED THIS VIDEO
OF ME AT AEROBICS.

15:48.648 --> 15:52.021
I TOTALLY FORGOT MY SPORTS BRA.

15:52.022 --> 15:54.153
YOU WHAT?

15:54.154 --> 15:57.286
I'M BOUNCING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

15:57.287 --> 15:59.288
( laughs ) YEAH, YOU ARE.

15:59.289 --> 16:01.590
LET'S JUST PUT THIS PHONE
AWAY, OKAY, CHELSEA?

16:01.591 --> 16:04.063
UM...

16:04.064 --> 16:06.335
LOOK, I GOT TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

16:06.336 --> 16:08.697
OKAY? AND THIS NEVER REALLY
EASY TO SAY TO SOMEBODY.

16:08.698 --> 16:10.469
- CHELSEA, YOU ARE AN...
- DO SMELL SMOKE?

16:10.470 --> 16:11.740
INCREDIBLE WOMAN... WHAT?

16:11.741 --> 16:13.302
OH, MY GOD.

16:13.303 --> 16:14.543
THAT STORE OVER
THERE IS ON FIRE.

16:14.544 --> 16:16.145
CALL 911.

16:16.146 --> 16:17.306
( fire alarm blaring )

16:17.307 --> 16:18.347
- JOE!
- NO, NO.

16:18.348 --> 16:19.408
I'M GONNA HANDLE
THIS, ALL RIGHT.

16:19.409 --> 16:21.010
YOU STAY HERE WHERE
THERE'S NO SEX.

16:21.011 --> 16:23.182
DANGER! WHAT DID I JUST SAY?
SEX?

16:23.183 --> 16:25.355
( laughs ) I MEANT DANGER.
STAY HERE.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.460
I'M SORRY IF I STILL
SMELL LIKE SMOKE.

16:31.461 --> 16:34.463
ALL I SMELL IS HEROISM.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.725
SO LOOK, UM...

16:36.726 --> 16:38.327
CHELSEA, I WAS, UM,

16:38.328 --> 16:41.330
TRYING TO TELL YOU THIS
BEFORE THE WHOLE FIRE THING.

16:41.331 --> 16:42.431
SHH.

16:42.432 --> 16:43.732
DON'T TRY TO TALK RIGHT NOW.

16:43.733 --> 16:46.775
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

16:46.776 --> 16:48.407
YOU WALKED INTO A
BURNING BUILDING

16:48.408 --> 16:51.110
WHILE EVERYONE JUST
STOOD THERE WATCHING.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.242
YEAH, IT'S REALLY AMAZING

16:53.243 --> 16:54.783
WHAT A WEEK'S WORTH
OF TESTOSTERONE

16:54.784 --> 16:57.086
WILL MAKE SOMEBODY DO.

16:57.087 --> 16:59.618
YOU'RE THE MOST AMAZING
MAN I HAVE EVER MET.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.221
OH, WELL, I...

17:06.756 --> 17:08.497
OH, MY GOD, THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

17:08.498 --> 17:10.429
THAT FEELS SO GOO... OKAY.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.630
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.233
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
WE SHOULD STOP.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.335
SHOULD WE?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.208
I'VE WAITED 28 YEARS
FOR THE PERFECT MAN.

17:19.209 --> 17:22.312
AND NOW I'VE FINALLY FOUND HIM.

17:23.313 --> 17:26.575
YOU... YOU MEAN ME?

17:26.576 --> 17:28.147
THE WAIT IS OVER.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.278
OH, THANK GOD!

17:29.279 --> 17:32.351
I'M SO GLAD THAT I SAVED MYSELF

17:32.352 --> 17:34.253
ALL THESE YEARS FOR YOU, JOE.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.126
AND JUST THINK. WE'RE GONNA
REMEMBER THIS MOMENT

17:37.127 --> 17:38.287
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

17:38.288 --> 17:39.529
( nervous laughter
) YEAH, WE WILL.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.493
WOW...

17:44.494 --> 17:45.734
OWW!

17:45.735 --> 17:47.266
OW! OH!

17:47.267 --> 17:48.297
OH.

17:48.298 --> 17:50.299
MY BACK! OH, MY...

17:50.300 --> 17:52.070
I PULLED IT AGAIN
PROBABLY WHEN I WAS

17:52.071 --> 17:53.472
SAVING ALL THOSE PEOPLE
FROM THE BURNING BUILDING.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.144
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME ICE.

17:55.145 --> 17:56.745
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET ON TOP?
GIVE YOU AN ADJUSTMENT?

17:56.746 --> 17:58.307
NO! NO.

17:58.308 --> 18:01.650
I DON'T WANT YOU WORKING
ON YOUR NIGHT OFF.

18:01.651 --> 18:02.812
THAT... THAT...

18:05.255 --> 18:08.357
MEL, LOOK, I NEED YOUR HELP.

18:08.358 --> 18:10.389
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

18:10.390 --> 18:13.722
MILAN. SECOND-DAY AIR.

18:13.723 --> 18:15.324
OH, IS THAT THE JACKET
YOU WEREN'T GONNA BUY

18:15.325 --> 18:16.325
TO SHOW ME HOW GOOD
YOU WERE AT WAITING?

18:16.326 --> 18:17.796
WAITING SUCKS, OKAY?

18:17.797 --> 18:20.529
"CLOSE YOUR LEGS" WAS WRITTEN
BY A WOMAN WITH 200 CATS.

18:20.530 --> 18:23.232
AT A CERTAIN POINT, YOU
JUST WANT TO GO FOR IT.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.633
YES. YES, YOU DO.
AND TO THAT POINT,

18:24.634 --> 18:27.336
CHELSEA IS UPSTAIRS IN
MY ROOM AND SHE'S READY.

18:27.337 --> 18:28.507
- YOU MEAN...
- YEAH, UH-HUH.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.439
SHE'S WAVING ME HOME.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.181
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

18:32.182 --> 18:34.343
THIS IS... OH OH OH, I SEE.

18:34.344 --> 18:35.814
A WOMAN WANTS TO SLEEP WITH ME

18:35.815 --> 18:36.845
AND YOU WANT THE CREDIT.

18:36.846 --> 18:39.648
YEAH. I SOLD HER ON THE WHOO!

18:39.649 --> 18:41.420
I HAD HER CURIOUS AND WORKED UP.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.521
AND THAT'S WHY
THIS IS HAPPENING.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.892
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS
HAPPENING BECAUSE

18:43.893 --> 18:45.354
I PULLED THREE PEOPLE
FROM A BURNING BUILDING.

18:45.355 --> 18:48.197
SERIOUSLY, WHICH ONE
SOUNDS MORE BELIEVABLE?

18:48.198 --> 18:49.498
WELL, MINE ACTUALLY
HAPPENED, ALL RIGHT?

18:49.499 --> 18:50.499
AND YOU'LL SEE IT ON
THE NEWS TONIGHT.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.800
THE POINT IS SHE'S UP THERE.

18:51.801 --> 18:54.363
AND SHE'S READY TO
DO IT AND I CAN'T.

18:54.364 --> 18:56.535
OH, JOE, THERE'S
NO SHAME IN THAT.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.168
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
PILLS YOU CAN TAKE.

18:59.169 --> 19:00.769
NO, NO. NOT THAT.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.242
I CAN DO IT. TRUST
ME, I CAN DO IT.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.344
THE POINT IS I DON'T
WANT TO ANYMORE.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.316
OKAY? I'M GONNA HAVE
TO BREAK UP WITH HER.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.248
OKAY, SO TO CLARIFY,

19:09.249 --> 19:10.579
YOU WERE GONNA BREAK UP WITH HER

19:10.580 --> 19:11.720
WHEN SHE WOULDN'T
SLEEP WITH YOU.

19:11.721 --> 19:12.821
BUT NOW THAT SHE WANTS
TO SLEEP WITH YOU,

19:12.822 --> 19:14.283
YOU ARE BREAKING UP WITH HER?

19:14.284 --> 19:17.626
- EXACTLY.
- YEAH, AND THEY SAY WOMEN ARE COMPLICATED.

19:17.627 --> 19:18.927
NO, NO. IT'S JUST THAT

19:18.928 --> 19:20.759
CHELSEA HAS WAITED HER
WHOLE LIFE TO DO THIS

19:20.760 --> 19:21.790
WITH THE MAN SHE'S
GONNA BE WITH FOREVER.

19:21.791 --> 19:23.232
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M THAT GUY.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.393
I'M NOT EVEN SURE I'M
IN LOVE WITH HER.

19:24.394 --> 19:26.164
I MEAN, YOU COULD BE
WITH SOMEONE FOR YEARS

19:26.165 --> 19:27.796
AND NOT KNOW THAT THEY'RE
THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOU.

19:27.797 --> 19:29.238
THAT'S TRUE.

19:29.239 --> 19:33.171
YOU COULD LIVE WITH SOMEONE FOR
YEARS AND STILL BE UNSURE.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.473
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

19:34.474 --> 19:35.644
WHAT?

19:35.645 --> 19:37.246
ABOUT ME AND CHELSEA?!

19:37.247 --> 19:38.477
OH! UH, OKAY.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.908
YOU NEED TO GO BACK
UP TO YOUR ROOM

19:39.909 --> 19:41.210
AND TELL HER YOU CAN'T DO IT.

19:41.211 --> 19:42.511
AGAIN, I CAN DO IT.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.383
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
OKAY, I GET IT.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.585
YOUR BOY PARTS WORK.
JUST GET UP THERE,

19:46.586 --> 19:48.387
BE A MAN AND KEEP
THAT GIRL A VIRGIN.

19:48.388 --> 19:51.290
CHELSEA,

19:51.291 --> 19:53.191
LOOK, I GOT TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.263
THERE YOU ARE.

19:54.264 --> 19:57.566
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA HAVE
TO START WITHOUT YOU.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.568
OW! OH, MY BACK AGAIN.

19:59.569 --> 20:00.630
MY BACK.

20:03.273 --> 20:04.234
( camera shutter clicks )

20:04.235 --> 20:06.375
I COULDN'T SAY IT.

20:06.376 --> 20:08.607
SHE'S NAKED. I COULD NOT SAY IT.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.380
SO YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO
RUN INTO A BURNING BUILDING,

20:11.381 --> 20:13.312
BUT NOT TO TELL A NAKED WOMAN
YOU CAN'T SLEEP WITH HER?

20:13.313 --> 20:14.613
LOOK, I MAY BE A HERO,
BUT EVEN SUPERMAN

20:14.614 --> 20:16.645
HAS HIS KRYPTONITE.

20:16.646 --> 20:18.518
FINE, I'LL DO IT.

20:19.789 --> 20:21.290
IT WON'T BE THE FIRST
TIME I'VE HAD TO TELL

20:21.291 --> 20:22.822
A HORNY NAKED WOMAN IT'S
NOT HAPPENING TONIGHT.

20:28.958 --> 20:29.959
READY TO GO OVER THE NEW ENDING?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.302
LENNOX,

20:33.303 --> 20:35.304
IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT

20:35.305 --> 20:36.535
WORKING WITH YOU
ON THIS PROJECT.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.267
THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOT TO TELL YOU

20:38.268 --> 20:39.508
AND IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME TO SAY.

20:39.509 --> 20:40.969
WHAT?

20:40.970 --> 20:43.342
RYDER WANTS YOU OUT. I TRIED
TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.415
I SAID WE NEED YOU, BUT
THERE'S NO TALKING TO HIM.

20:46.416 --> 20:47.716
IS THIS TRUE?

20:47.717 --> 20:49.648
YEAH. YUP.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.420
IT'S ALL ME.

20:51.421 --> 20:52.821
ZANDER BEGGED ME TO KEEP YOU ON.

20:52.822 --> 20:54.483
BUT I TOLD HIM EITHER YOU GO

20:54.484 --> 20:55.484
OR WE DITCH THE WHOLE THING.

20:55.485 --> 20:56.525
OH, WHATEVER.

20:56.526 --> 20:57.556
I DIDN'T WANT TO
BE A PART OF THIS

20:57.557 --> 20:59.257
STUPID COMIC ANYWAY.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.489
THANKS FOR STICKING
UP FOR ME, BABE.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.530
YEAH.

21:01.531 --> 21:03.562
AND YOU...

21:03.563 --> 21:04.934
I KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP.

21:08.538 --> 21:09.868
( whispering ) I'M SORRY.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.440
I'M SO SORRY. I
TOTALLY PANICKED.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.001
IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

21:13.002 --> 21:14.543
YOU HAVE A LOT MORE TO LOSE.

21:14.544 --> 21:15.774
( normal voice ) YOU GONNA
GET A LOT OF CRAP FOR THIS?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.706
YEAH, BUT IT BOUNCES OFF ME,

21:17.707 --> 21:18.747
'CAUSE, UM,

21:18.748 --> 21:21.650
I'M HOME BOY.

21:21.651 --> 21:23.582
DON'T EVER SAY THAT TO A GIRL.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.315
- DULY NOTED.
- OKAY.
