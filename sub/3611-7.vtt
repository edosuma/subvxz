00:02.003 --> 00:03.664
Previously on Lost:

00:03.754 --> 00:06.996
The only way to save the island
is to get your people back.

00:07.091 --> 00:08.831
The chopper was headed for the boat.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.508
- The boat...
- They're fine. They're already home.

00:11.596 --> 00:15.259
- You convince them to come back.
- How am I supposed to do that?

00:15.391 --> 00:17.256
You're gonna have to die, John.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.725
You're going down there?

00:20.855 --> 00:24.347
- What exactly are you hoping to find?
- A way off the island.

00:35.953 --> 00:39.036
Once you get all of your friends,
it must be all of them,

00:39.123 --> 00:42.286
everyone who left,
once you've persuaded them to join you,

00:42.460 --> 00:46.874
Eloise Hawking will tell you
exactly how to come back.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.546
Richard said I was going to die.

00:49.634 --> 00:52.467
That's why they call it "sacrifice".

02:16.470 --> 02:18.210
Caesar.

02:20.391 --> 02:22.131
llana.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.763
- What's up?
- Find anything?

02:24.854 --> 02:28.221
- No. Nothing useful.
- Then what'd you put in your bag?

02:40.578 --> 02:42.910
If you want it, it's yours.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.743
We found someone. A man.

02:48.711 --> 02:51.498
- What?
- Roxanne was scouting south of here.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.580
And he was just standing in the water.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.256
He's wearing a suit.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.959
- Nobody recognizes him?
- No.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.801
He didn't come with us.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.012
How do we know he isn't one
who disappeared?

03:02.099 --> 03:03.930
- He's not.
- And how do you know?

03:04.060 --> 03:06.847
Because he wasn't on the plane.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.145
- What did this man have to say?
- You can ask him yourself.

03:29.502 --> 03:32.460
- Hello.
- Hello.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.380
My name is Caesar. What's yours?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.473
My name is John Locke.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.296
Morning.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.810
Hello.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.514
Breakfast?

04:31.605 --> 04:35.189
- We found a tree. They're pretty good.
- Much obliged.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.016
- l'm llana.
- John.

04:39.864 --> 04:42.025
Are those your boats?

04:42.575 --> 04:45.612
No. They were already here.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.115
There used to be three,

04:48.205 --> 04:51.038
but the pilot and some woman took one.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.538
Didn't tell anyone, just ran off
in the middle of the night.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.086
- The pilot that brought you here?
- Yes.

04:58.174 --> 04:59.664
That's right.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.373
Do you have a passenger list?

05:04.722 --> 05:06.713
You'll have to talk to Caesar.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.567
I think this is the best mango
I've ever eaten.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.573
Nobody remembers you
being on the plane.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.914
I don't remember either.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.333
- What do you remember?
- I remember a lot.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.957
Like why you're dressed up so nice?

05:41.091 --> 05:44.709
- No, but I can guess.
- Please. Guess.

05:47.932 --> 05:51.891
I think this suit is what they
were going to bury me in.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.353
- Sorry?
- You asked what I remembered.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.981
I remember dying.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.741
Good luck, John.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.844
Say hello to my son.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.714
Who's your son?

07:22.234 --> 07:25.021
If anybody is there, can you help me?!

08:31.303 --> 08:33.794
Where is this? Where are we?

08:33.889 --> 08:35.174
Where am |?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.971
Sir, where am |?

08:44.066 --> 08:45.101
Who are you?

08:47.444 --> 08:50.277
Where am |? Do you speak English?

08:53.992 --> 08:55.732
You swallow.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.826
Swallow.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.295
Where are we?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.634
You bite. Bite!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.512
John...

10:01.518 --> 10:02.974
Wake up.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.359
You had a compound fracture.

10:14.156 --> 10:17.193
The doctors did their best,
but I had a specialist flown in

10:17.284 --> 10:18.865
to reset your leg properly.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.659
It's nice to see you again, John.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.705
- Do I know you?
- Yes.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.550
I understand your being confused.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.135
lmagine howl feel.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.891
I met you when l was 17.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.890
Now all these years later,
here we are.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.190
You look exactly the same.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.439
- Who are you?
- My name is Charles Widmore.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.156
Tell me, John...

11:03.872 --> 11:07.410
...how long has it been for you
since we first met?

11:07.501 --> 11:11.585
Since you walked into our camp
and you spoke to Richard?

11:13.215 --> 11:16.503
- Four days.
- That's incredible.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.588
The camera in the desert.
That was yours?

11:19.680 --> 11:20.920
Yeah.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.721
- How did you know I'd be there?
- That's the exit.

11:25.561 --> 11:30.430
l was afraid Benjamin might fool you
into leaving the island, as he did me.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.435
l was their leader.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.027
- The Others?
- They're not "Others" to me.

11:37.114 --> 11:41.448
They're my people.
We protected the island peacefully,

11:41.535 --> 11:43.571
for more than three decades.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.278
But then I was exiled.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.451
By him.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.957
- Just as you were.
- No.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.377
Ben wasn't even there when I left.
He was already gone.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.958
l... lwasn't exiled,
I chose to leave.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.169
Why... would you do that, John?

12:08.437 --> 12:11.804
You've come to bring them back,
the ones who left?

12:13.025 --> 12:14.936
No.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.020
I understand your lying to me, I do.

12:20.157 --> 12:24.321
But there's something you should know.
All your friends who left the island...

12:25.871 --> 12:27.953
...they've been back three years.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.248
- Three years?
- They've gone back to normal lives.

12:31.335 --> 12:35.078
And none of them has spoken
a word of truth about where they were.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.802
l have to bring them back.

12:44.890 --> 12:48.508
I'm going to do everything
in my power to help you do that.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.348
Why?

12:53.148 --> 12:56.686
- Why?
- Why would you help me?

12:59.863 --> 13:01.649
Because there's a war coming.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.068
And if you're not back on
the island when that happens...

13:08.246 --> 13:10.453
...the wrong side is going to win.

13:22.094 --> 13:25.336
- "Jeremy Bentham?"
- He was a British philosopher.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.723
Your parents had a sense of humor
when they named you. So why can't I?

13:31.645 --> 13:33.806
That should be money enough for now.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.101
The phone's international.

13:37.234 --> 13:41.898
If you need to reach me,
for anything, just press 2-3.

13:42.906 --> 13:46.114
The folder contains
your people's whereabouts.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.408
Everyone that was on the island
that left.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.992
You've been watching them?

13:54.084 --> 13:58.077
I'm deeply invested in the future
of the island, John.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.874
Yes, I've been watching them.

14:02.884 --> 14:06.672
I wouldn't mention l'm involved.
I can't imagine what they think of me,

14:06.763 --> 14:10.130
- having listened to Benjamin's lies.
- How do I know you're not lying?

14:10.225 --> 14:11.886
I haven't tried to kill you.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.056
Can you say the same for him?

14:19.192 --> 14:22.184
- You still don't trust me.
- You sent a team of killers

14:22.279 --> 14:24.440
and a boatload of C-4 to the island.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.523
That doesn't exactly scream "trust".

14:27.617 --> 14:29.528
I needed Linus removed.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.573
So it could be your time.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.157
- Right.
- The island needs you, John.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.789
It has for a long time.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.378
What makes you think I'm so special?

14:45.802 --> 14:47.542
Because you are.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.808
Your chariot has arrived.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.437
- He said I would die.
- Beg your pardon?

15:02.527 --> 15:06.486
Richard Alpert said the only way
to get them to come back was if I died.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.823
I don't know why he said that,

15:10.911 --> 15:12.902
but I'm not going to let that happen.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.246
This is Matthew Abaddon.
He'll take you anywhere you need to go.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.545
Protect you from whomever
intends to do you harm.

15:25.842 --> 15:26.877
Mr. Locke.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.643
Good luck, John. Godspeed.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.672
Anything you need, Mr. Locke,
you just let me know. Anything.

16:10.053 --> 16:13.420
Anybody from your past
you want me to look up for you?

16:14.349 --> 16:18.058
The world thinks you're dead. There must
be somebody happy to see you.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.929
- Please don't talk to me.
- You got it.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.991
We're almost at the airport,
tell me where we're going first.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.073
Santo Domingo.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.404
Sayid!

17:27.881 --> 17:30.714
I don't believe this.
You actually want me to go back?

17:30.800 --> 17:34.213
I know how it sounds.
But you have to trust me.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.171
- This is the only way to save them.
- I'm not going back.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.809
Two years l was manipulated into
thinking I was protecting everyone.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.432
Who was manipulating you?

17:45.315 --> 17:46.771
Ben.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.821
- So who is manipulating you, John?
- This is coming from me, nobody else.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.532
I know you, Sayid.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.778
In your heart, you know we never
should have left the island.

18:00.872 --> 18:05.286
Because I left the island l was finally
able to marry the woman I loved.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.833
We spent nine months together.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.749
The best nine months of my life, John.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.002
That's what I know in my heart.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.224
Where is she now?

18:21.559 --> 18:22.719
She was murdered.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.527
I'm sorry.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.862
Why do you really need to go back?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.737
ls itjust because you have
nowhere else to go?

18:45.583 --> 18:48.541
If you change your mind,
I'll be under the name Jeremy Bentham

18:48.628 --> 18:50.619
in LA at the Westerfield Hotel.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.373
And if you change your mind,

18:55.468 --> 18:58.460
you are welcome to come back here
and do some real good.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.386
Goodbye, John.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.496
You asked if there was someone
you could look up for me.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.949
Yes, I did.

19:29.085 --> 19:33.294
Her name is Helen. Helen Norwood.
She was living in Los Angeles.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.996
She an old girlfriend of yours?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.302
Help me out of the car.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.055
That's Michael Dawson's son?

19:48.146 --> 19:50.102
Yeah.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.396
Boy's gotten big.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.951
I'm gonna be right back.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.458
I'll give you two some privacy.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.634
- Hey, John.
- Hi, Walt.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.842
- What happened?
- I hurt my leg.

20:26.142 --> 20:29.225
You don't seem surprised to see me.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.054
I've been having dreams about you.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.139
You're on the island wearing a suit.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.652
And there are people all around you.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.813
- They wanted to hurt you, John.
- Good thing they're just dreams.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.575
Is my dad... is he back on the island?

20:45.662 --> 20:48.119
I haven't talked to him in three years.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.162
I figured he must have gone back.

20:54.045 --> 20:57.333
Last I heard, your dad was
on a freighter near the island.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.584
Why'd you come to see me?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.509
I wanted to make sure you were OK.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.771
Yeah. I'm doing pretty good.

21:15.984 --> 21:19.442
I gotta go.
It was good seeing you, John.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.611
Take care.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.913
I take it you didn't invite him along.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.618
- Boy's been through enough.
- That's 0 for 2, Mr. Locke.

21:35.712 --> 21:39.671
Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought
you had to bring everyone back.

21:39.757 --> 21:44.342
| only need to convince one.
lfl can do that, the rest will come.

21:45.555 --> 21:49.514
Maybe I was mistaken,
but I thought you were my driver.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.659
Hello, Hugo.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.839
So you didn't make it.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.836
- Pardon me?
- You didn't make it.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.551
It's cool, no biggie.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.303
You're not the first person to visit me.

22:34.062 --> 22:36.769
But what's up with the wheelchair?

22:36.856 --> 22:39.973
- I broke my leg falling down a hole.
- Is that how you died?

22:43.238 --> 22:44.819
Hugo, I'm not dead.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.445
- Sure you're not.
- I promise you,

22:50.578 --> 22:52.114
I'm very much alive.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.410
Hey, Susie. Am I talking to a
dude in a wheelchair right now?

22:56.501 --> 22:57.707
Yeah.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.459
What are you doing here?

23:03.591 --> 23:05.877
I need you to come back
to the island with me.

23:05.969 --> 23:09.302
- Wait... What?
- Notjust you. Everybody who left.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.342
- You mean Jack and Kate...
- Everybody.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.679
Sorry, dude, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.765
Jack's a doctor now.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.566
And Sun's got her baby.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.610
And Kate's got Aaron...

23:28.324 --> 23:30.030
Dude. Be cool.

23:31.286 --> 23:34.278
Don't look, but we're being watched.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.449
Dude!

23:36.332 --> 23:37.742
Don't worry, he's with me.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.291
- What?
- He's driving me around. He's OK.

23:40.378 --> 23:44.371
That dude is far from OK.
When I first got locked up in here,

23:48.761 --> 23:51.138
- You should not be trusting that guy.
- Listen...

23:51.222 --> 23:54.180
- No! I'm not listening to you!
- Hugo, please! Listen...

23:55.101 --> 23:57.012
I want to go back in!

23:57.103 --> 24:00.015
- Hugo!
- I'm not going anywhere! Go away!

24:00.106 --> 24:03.018
- Bye! Get out of here!
- It's OK.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.910
That's three visits now.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.906
You may want to step up your game,
Mr. Locke.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.993
Or we're all in serious trouble.

24:25.214 --> 24:28.422
What exactly is it that
you do for Mr. Widmore, Matthew?

24:31.471 --> 24:33.132
You're ready to talk about it?

24:36.225 --> 24:39.888
John... You're not really
gonna pretend you don't remember

24:39.979 --> 24:43.517
that l was an orderly in the hospital
right after your accident?

24:43.608 --> 24:46.395
That I was the one who told you
to go on your walkabout?

24:46.819 --> 24:50.778
The same walkabout that put you on
the plane that crashed on that island?

24:51.908 --> 24:53.364
No.

24:53.493 --> 24:54.949
I remember.

24:55.078 --> 24:58.411
| help people get to where
they need to get to, John.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.990
That's what I do for Mr. Widmore.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.472
The answer is no.

25:27.151 --> 25:30.939
- Kate, I don't think you under...
- You made yourself perfectly clear.

25:31.072 --> 25:34.564
Everyone on the island is going to die
if I don't go back.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.945
- And the answer is no.
- Why?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.277
Don't you care about them?

25:44.127 --> 25:47.039
- You ever been in love, John?
- What?

25:48.256 --> 25:49.792
I think about you sometimes.

25:51.050 --> 25:55.589
I think about how desperate
you were to stay on that island.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.141
And then I realized...

26:04.605 --> 26:07.438
...it was all because
you didn't love anybody.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.819
That's not true.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.819
I loved someone...

26:15.074 --> 26:16.314
...once.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.156
Her name was Helen.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.500
What happened?

26:33.176 --> 26:35.087
ltjust didn't work out.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.045
Why not, John?

26:43.603 --> 26:45.343
l was angry.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.136
l was...

26:50.526 --> 26:52.437
...obsessed.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.357
Look how far you've come.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.544
- Let me help you, Mr. Locke.
- Did you find her?

27:15.718 --> 27:17.674
- Find who?
- Helen Norwood.

27:17.762 --> 27:20.845
- The woman I asked you about.
- No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.006
Three years is a long time.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.842
It's possible she got married,
changed her name, moved...

27:25.937 --> 27:28.519
You found everyone else. All of them.

27:30.066 --> 27:33.399
Sayid was in the middle of nowhere.
You can't find Helen because she moved?

27:34.862 --> 27:38.730
Yourjob is to get people to where they
need to get to? I need to get to her.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.674
What happened to her?

28:03.432 --> 28:05.514
She died of a brain aneurysm.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.016
I'm very sorry, Mr. Locke.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.819
She loved me.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.533
lfl had just...

28:26.455 --> 28:27.991
We could have been together.

28:28.082 --> 28:33.372
Maybe you could have. But that wouldn't
change anything. She'd still be gone.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.589
Would she?

28:39.218 --> 28:41.254
Helen is where she's supposed to be.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.637
Sad as it is, her path led here.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.181
Your path, no matter what
you did or what you do,

28:48.269 --> 28:50.385
your path leads back to the island.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.024
You say that like it's all...
inevitable.

28:57.153 --> 29:01.522
Mr. Widmore told me Richard Alpert
said that you were going to die.

29:01.616 --> 29:04.449
So you tell me, John...
Is that inevitable,

29:04.535 --> 29:07.993
- or is it a choice?
- You think I want to die?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.581
How is that...

29:09.707 --> 29:12.244
How could you possibly
think that's a choice?

29:17.340 --> 29:19.001
I'm just a driver.

29:36.359 --> 29:37.439
Matthew!

30:42.675 --> 30:44.666
What are you doing here?

30:49.849 --> 30:52.682
Jack, how did you find me?

30:52.768 --> 30:57.182
You were in a car accident.
You were brought in to my hospital.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.638
What are you doing here?

31:04.697 --> 31:06.858
We have to go back.

31:08.743 --> 31:10.483
Of course.

31:10.578 --> 31:13.866
- Of course we do.
- The people I left behind need help.

31:13.956 --> 31:17.369
- We're supposed to go back.
- Because it's our "destiny"?

31:17.460 --> 31:19.200
How many times
are you going to say that?

31:19.295 --> 31:22.002
How can you not see it?

31:22.089 --> 31:26.128
Of all the hospitals, | end up here?
You don't think that's fate?

31:26.218 --> 31:30.006
Your car accident was
on the west side of Los Angeles.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.713
You being brought
in to my hospital isn't fate.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.390
- John, it's probability.
- You don't understand.

31:35.478 --> 31:38.686
It wasn't an accident.
Somebody is trying to kill me.

31:38.773 --> 31:42.311
- Why would someone try to kill you?
- They don't want me to succeed.

31:42.401 --> 31:47.270
They want to stop me. They don't want me
to get back because I'm important.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.779
Have you ever stopped to think

31:52.870 --> 31:57.580
that these delusions
that you're special...

31:57.666 --> 31:59.657
...aren't real?

31:59.752 --> 32:02.835
That maybe there's nothing
important about you at all?

32:02.922 --> 32:07.791
Maybe you are just a lonely old man
that crashed on an island.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.301
That's it.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.058
Goodbye, John.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.229
Your father says hello.

32:21.398 --> 32:22.649
What?

32:24.276 --> 32:25.732
Aman...

32:25.820 --> 32:29.278
The man who told me to move the island,
how to bring you all back...

32:29.365 --> 32:31.481
He said to tell his son "hello".

32:31.575 --> 32:34.317
It couldn't have been Sayid's.
It wasn't Hurley's.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.538
That leaves you.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.034
He said his name was Christian.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.870
My... My father...

32:46.423 --> 32:47.458
...is dead.

32:47.550 --> 32:51.168
- Well, he didn't look dead to me.
- He died in Australia,

32:51.262 --> 32:53.799
three years ago,
I put him in the coffin!

32:55.558 --> 32:56.843
He's dead.

32:56.934 --> 32:58.845
Jack. Please. You have to come back.

32:58.936 --> 33:02.178
You're the only one who
can convince them! You have to help me.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.855
- You're supposed to help me!
- John, it's over!

33:04.942 --> 33:08.560
It's done. We left.
And we were never important.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.737
So you... you leave me alone.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.569
And you leave the rest of them alone!

35:43.225 --> 35:44.635
John?

35:45.227 --> 35:46.683
John?!

35:50.733 --> 35:52.473
John, what are you doing?

35:53.694 --> 35:56.401
Wait! Please, John, stop!

36:00.284 --> 36:03.276
- How did you find me?
- l have a man watching Sayid...

36:04.663 --> 36:07.621
I'm watching all of them,
keeping them safe.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.700
When you turned up,
he called me.

36:10.794 --> 36:14.628
Who...? What are you doing here?

36:14.715 --> 36:16.421
- Calm down.
- What do you want?!

36:16.508 --> 36:18.885
- Please let me help...
- Answer the question!

36:18.969 --> 36:20.584
I'm trying to protect you!

36:21.638 --> 36:22.673
Protect me?

36:26.935 --> 36:28.596
You shot him.

36:29.772 --> 36:32.263
- You killed Abaddon.
- Yes.

36:33.734 --> 36:37.773
Yes, I did. But it was only a matter
of time before he tried to kill you.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.525
l was trying to get to you
but you drove off and crashed.

36:40.616 --> 36:43.358
- Why would...
- He was working for Charles Widmore.

36:43.452 --> 36:47.946
- He's extremely dangerous...
- No! Widmore came to me.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.780
- He saved me.
- No, he used you.

36:49.875 --> 36:53.788
He waited till you showed up so that
you could help him get to the island.

36:53.921 --> 36:57.413
Charles Widmore is the reason
I moved the island!

36:57.966 --> 36:59.922
So that he could never find it again.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.717
To keep him away
so that you could lead.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.184
You can't do this.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.603
If anything happens to you...

37:18.779 --> 37:22.112
John, you have no idea
how important you are.

37:24.535 --> 37:25.820
Let me help you.

37:29.331 --> 37:31.947
There is no helping me.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.500
l'm...

37:37.923 --> 37:39.584
- I'm a failure.
- No you're not.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.336
I am!

37:43.345 --> 37:47.509
I couldn't get any of them. I couldn't
get a single one to come back with me.

37:48.934 --> 37:52.051
- I can't "lead" anyone.
- Jack booked a ticket.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.389
What?

37:57.526 --> 37:59.983
A plane ticket
from Los Angeles to Sydney tonight.

38:00.696 --> 38:02.812
Return trip first thing in the morning.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.369
Whatever you said to him, John?
It worked.

38:11.457 --> 38:15.826
And if you got Jack?
You can get the rest of them.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.420
John...

38:23.886 --> 38:25.797
You can't die.

38:25.888 --> 38:28.504
You've got too much work to do.

38:29.391 --> 38:32.508
We've got to get you back
to that island so you can do it.

38:49.369 --> 38:50.779
Please, John.

38:51.663 --> 38:52.698
Come on.

38:57.794 --> 38:59.534
Come down.

39:17.231 --> 39:19.267
I know we can do this, John.

39:19.942 --> 39:22.433
You haven't even been to Sun yet.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.811
- Let's start with her.
- No.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.696
I promised Jin
I wouldn't bring her back.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.152
Jin is alive?

39:33.288 --> 39:36.576
Yeah. But he doesn't want her to know.

39:36.667 --> 39:39.033
He wanted me to tell her...

39:40.170 --> 39:43.003
...that his body washed up on the beach.

39:43.632 --> 39:46.590
He gave me his wedding ring
to prove it.

39:46.677 --> 39:50.511
All right. A promise is a promise.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.726
Thank you.

40:05.779 --> 40:07.280
You're welcome.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.613
Come on. Here.

40:15.247 --> 40:16.737
Let's go.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.786
I know we can do this.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.493
Once we can get them
all in the same place,

40:25.674 --> 40:29.258
I don't know where we go from there,
but we'll figure something out.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.968
I know where we go.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.600
There's a woman,
here in Los Angeles.

40:35.684 --> 40:36.764
- A woman?
- Yeah.

40:36.852 --> 40:41.095
I don't know exactly where, but
she shouldn't be that hard to find.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.646
Her name is...

40:43.734 --> 40:46.146
...Eloise Hawking.

40:48.447 --> 40:52.440
- Eloise Hawking? You sure?
- Yeah. Why, do you know her?

40:54.870 --> 40:57.236
Yes, John. I know her.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.839
I'll miss you, John.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.809
I really will.

43:15.093 --> 43:19.757
That symbol belongs to an organization
called the Dharma lnitiative.

43:20.932 --> 43:24.174
They were conducting some
experiments here a while back.

43:24.978 --> 43:28.186
- How do you know that?
- I spent 100 days on this island.

43:28.273 --> 43:30.685
- I know a lot.
- A hundred days?

43:30.776 --> 43:33.142
So when we crashed,
you were already here?

43:34.321 --> 43:37.404
No. I left.

43:39.451 --> 43:41.157
How long ago did you leave?

43:42.496 --> 43:44.953
The timing would just confuse you.

43:45.707 --> 43:48.323
Well, how'd you get back?

43:48.418 --> 43:51.535
To be honest, that part's
a bit of a mystery to me.

43:52.297 --> 43:53.878
OK, John Locke.

43:55.342 --> 43:57.207
l have a mystery, too.

43:58.053 --> 44:01.671
- Maybe you can help me with it?
- I'm happy to try.

44:02.974 --> 44:07.092
On the plane, I was sitting across the
aisle from that big guy with curly hair.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.347
When the plane started shaking,
really shaking,

44:11.441 --> 44:13.898
there was a big noise
and a bright light.

44:14.653 --> 44:17.986
And this big guy with curly hair...
was gone, man.

44:18.740 --> 44:21.356
I mean literally gone.
And it wasn't only him.

44:22.619 --> 44:24.826
Some of us saw it happen
to other people.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.700
So, Mr. John Locke,

44:28.834 --> 44:30.995
do you have an idea
about what happened?

44:34.089 --> 44:38.753
I think I might know
how I came to be here.

44:41.513 --> 44:45.756
But that would involve me finding my
friends. Do you have a passenger list?

44:45.851 --> 44:49.560
- The pilot took it when he ran off.
- And everyone's accounted for?

44:49.646 --> 44:52.979
All of the people,
other than the ones who disappeared?

44:53.066 --> 44:55.432
Except for the people who got hurt.

44:55.527 --> 44:57.188
"The people who got hurt?"

45:30.937 --> 45:32.473
You know him?

45:34.065 --> 45:35.316
Yeah.

45:38.778 --> 45:40.518
He's the man who killed me.
