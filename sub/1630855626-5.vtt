WEBVTT

00:19.060 --> 00:20.478
When Mayor Joker
disbanded the police

00:20.562 --> 00:22.397
and launched me
into forced retirement,

00:22.480 --> 00:25.108
I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.318
From the ashes
that are my career,

00:27.444 --> 00:31.031
a fiery,
bosomy phoenix has risen.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.200
And that phoenix
is you, Barbara,

00:34.325 --> 00:36.327
Ooh, I can't wait
to make love to you

00:36.453 --> 00:38.663
for the first time in 20 years.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.290
[cell phone vibrating]

00:40.373 --> 00:42.917
I should just see who this is.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.962
-Yello?
-Hey, it's Nora Freeze,
nee Jacobsen,

00:46.046 --> 00:48.381
executive assistant to the CEO
of the Legion of Doom.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.091
-Charmed, I'm sure.
-Un-charmed.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.135
-What do you want?
-Well, the LOD needs
a security guard,

00:52.218 --> 00:54.929
and I found your resume taped
to a dartboard at Noonan's.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.014
So you want the job?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.807
Yes! I accept. [chuckles]

00:57.891 --> 00:59.309
Oh, my God. Thank you.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.852
I was going crazy
in retirement.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.604
Passionate lovemaking
with the woman of my dreams

01:02.687 --> 01:05.397
is too much pressure
for this ol' sack.

01:05.522 --> 01:09.194
-What's going on, baby?
-Duty calls, mon cherie.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.904
-Whoo-hoo!
-[engine starts]

01:11.029 --> 01:12.739
Jimmy G's back, baby.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.200
How am I supposed
to get down from here?

01:15.283 --> 01:17.327
[sighs] Oh, Barbara.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.205
[theme music playing]

01:24.417 --> 01:26.169
-[thuds]
-[Nightwing] Ow!

01:26.252 --> 01:28.922
Remember this binder
from when we fought
the CleggBnB guest?

01:29.047 --> 01:30.548
Man, that was amazing.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.009
I mean, look, it still has
some of Yonas's pubes on it.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.345
-[chuckling]
-Harley, maybe focus
on the mission.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.763
I was thinking that too.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
Wait. Where are you guys'
friendship bracelets?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.351
[Nightwing]
We're not wearing them
because we're not friends.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.687
We're just super people
who fight crime together.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.271
[grunting]

01:45.396 --> 01:46.898
Of course we're friends!

01:47.023 --> 01:48.983
[yelps] Just like my old crew.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.235
Batgirl, you're King Shark.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.860
Robin, you're Psycho.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.572
Uh. [grunts] And Nightwing,
[grunts] you are Clayface,

01:54.656 --> 01:56.616
because of what
a drama queen you are.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.369
Stop talking
while we're fighting.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.246
See, such a Clayface.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.288
[crook grunts]

02:02.414 --> 02:03.623
[Harley grunts]

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
Ya!

02:06.751 --> 02:08.419
I never realized
how bad my night vision was

02:08.502 --> 02:10.130
until I started sneaking around
in the shadows with you.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.883
[gasps] It does explain
why I went down
on Ivy's armpit.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.094
-Meh, she still got there.
-Harley, watch out!

02:16.219 --> 02:18.722
-[crook growls]
-[Harley grunting]

02:18.805 --> 02:20.265
-Ooh!
-Dude, watch
where you're going!

02:20.390 --> 02:21.975
Okay, okay.
I see what's going on.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.852
You haven't let me
into your hearts
because my eyes suck.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.937
Don't boop my tummy!

02:26.021 --> 02:27.188
I'll protect you.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.565
[grunts]

02:28.648 --> 02:29.607
[groans]

02:31.443 --> 02:33.069
[Harley groans]

02:33.153 --> 02:34.446
The LASIK went great!

02:34.571 --> 02:36.406
Your night vision is now 20/20.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.116
Thank you
for the hero discount.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.452
I cannot wait
to surprise the Bat Family
with my new eyes.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.370
If they see how far
I'm willing to go
to be better,

02:42.454 --> 02:44.956
maybe they'll reciprocate
and wear my bracelet.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.375
Mmm-hmm.
We called your
emergency contact

02:47.459 --> 02:50.337
to pick you up,
but her assistant said
she was unavailable.

02:50.462 --> 02:53.631
She also said
parting my hair like this
makes me look matronly.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.341
But she couldn't see me, right?

02:55.466 --> 02:57.510
Ugh, yeah. Nora.
Let me try, Ivy.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.429
Call Soulmate Peach Emoji

02:59.512 --> 03:02.349
-Sweat Droplets Emoji
Devil Horn Smile.
-[dialing]

03:02.474 --> 03:04.642
Hi, you've reached Ivy.
Leave a message.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.478
But just remember,
this could've been a text.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.313
Oh, she must be stuck
in Moon customs.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.357
Is there anyone else
we could call?

03:10.482 --> 03:12.484
Yeah, I got a list
a mile fucking long.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.195
-Where are you?
-I'm at the doctor.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.613
Guess what kind.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.490
Okay. That was
fucking rude, even for him.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.659
But, uh, that's fine.
I'll just call the earl
of twirl, Batgirl!

03:21.785 --> 03:24.746
Harley. I'm so happy
to hear from you.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.624
I'm having quite
the time getting to Italy.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.626
Sir, we'll ask you
one more time.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.503
Why won't you
take off your mask?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.421
Yeah. I didn't actually mean
to call you. I gotta go.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.964
Don't hang up.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.966
I need you
to tell Nora that...
Goddamn it!

03:38.051 --> 03:40.261
-[Harley snoring]
-[lounge music playing]

03:40.345 --> 03:42.555
[Supergirl] You better find
someone else to pick you up,

03:42.680 --> 03:45.934
or else we'll be forced
to reverse the surgery
so you can get home yourself.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.811
Okay, I'm trying. I'm trying

03:50.980 --> 03:52.941
[ringing]

03:54.984 --> 03:57.570
I've been abandoned!

03:57.696 --> 03:59.864
[people cheering
and applauding]

03:59.948 --> 04:02.075
There's the woman
who conquered the Moon.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.368
Saw you with Steppenwolf.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.412
-Big ups.
-This is from Talia Al Ghul.

04:05.537 --> 04:09.249
Aw, this pretzel gun
is so realistic.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.917
Look at that.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.294
The bullets are cookies.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.879
So while I was gone,
what'd I miss?

04:15.005 --> 04:16.630
I don't know. I thought
when you were off, I was off.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.882
Hey, careful where
you shoot those guns.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.301
They kill the waistline.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.387
-[laughing]
-Oh, Lex. You look very taut.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.347
Your hair looks spiky,

04:24.431 --> 04:27.100
and your cheeks are
very high up.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.560
-Get over here, girly
-Hmm?

04:28.643 --> 04:30.395
You killed it
at the conference.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.897
Really? Because
you seemed a little mad

04:33.023 --> 04:35.400
when you screamed at everyone
to get off your moon.

04:35.483 --> 04:39.779
Oh, sudden rage is
a side effect of forcing
my body to accept falcon DNA.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.323
I came here to help
bring you to the next level.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.909
I'm gifting you my PR team.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.077
The Jons.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.579
They're the best in the biz.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.372
Thank you, Lex.
That's very generous.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.582
And also for you guys,

04:50.665 --> 04:51.916
love how all of your shoes

04:52.000 --> 04:53.585
are a slightly different
shade of brown.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.211
Gasp! They're chestnut.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.546
-Teak.
-Taupe.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.797
Milk chocolate,
but the European kind.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.257
I really don't think
I need a PR team.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.633
The work speaks for itself.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.428
-Ring, ring, ring, ring.
-Uh, hello? Delusion.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.096
Girl, how'd you get
this number?

05:05.180 --> 05:06.765
Excuse me, Ivy, It's for you.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.269
Now that I've introduced you
to redshirt guy, computer dude,

05:11.353 --> 05:12.937
and guy who doesn't know
I hate him.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.357
-Hey!
-I can show you
the best part of the office

05:15.440 --> 05:18.026
because it's where
I need to go
to refill my coffee.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.361
Great to be back in an office.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.820
Sure, it's a bad guy HQ,

05:20.945 --> 05:22.655
but a paycheck,
no matter who signs it

05:22.781 --> 05:24.866
is the most fulfilling thing
a man can have in his life.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.951
Ooh, what are
all these gadgets?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.370
Junk that LexCorp makes.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.039
Sentient paper shredder,
black hole generator.

05:31.122 --> 05:34.042
That's either a microwave oven
or a cloning device.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.794
Uh, who are they?

05:35.877 --> 05:38.546
[Nora] Uh, those are
Ivy's mentees.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.131
You got the rocks one,

05:40.215 --> 05:42.133
the fire one,

05:42.217 --> 05:43.968
and the little swampy one.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.473
-Well, I'll be damned.
-Get your elbow off that.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.933
[Gordon] Oh, that was me,
wasn't it?

05:50.016 --> 05:50.933
[energy whirrs and stops]

05:52.519 --> 05:53.937
Hey, one bag a day.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.438
Don't think you're getting
any special treatment

05:55.522 --> 05:57.273
just 'cause
I boinked your bog dad!

05:57.357 --> 05:58.775
Stop bringing that up!

06:00.151 --> 06:02.404
All right,
so you guys are a team now,

06:02.487 --> 06:04.823
and teams deserve names.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.534
And also, sorry about
the shirts having
a basketball on them.

06:07.659 --> 06:11.162
I just really couldn't
figure out how to make 'em
without a template. So...

06:11.287 --> 06:13.665
I got the one
with the order number sticker.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.668
It is time for you guys
to make your big public debut.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.878
So what ideas have
you been kicking around?

06:19.004 --> 06:21.006
-Go.
-There's a network
of dormant volcanoes

06:21.089 --> 06:23.425
beneath Gotham
that I want to activate.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.135
We could toss in
pervy celebrities

06:25.218 --> 06:26.553
for a photo op.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.054
Earthquake bingo.

06:28.179 --> 06:32.808
-Um, okay.
Can you elaborate on that?
-No.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.770
Um, I've been working
on my access to the red,

06:35.854 --> 06:37.480
the force that connects
all animal life.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.482
I want to repopulate
the sharks in Gotham Bay,

06:39.566 --> 06:41.067
restoring balance
to the sea life

06:41.192 --> 06:44.112
and ruining
everyone's summer. [chuckles]

06:44.195 --> 06:45.321
I love these ideas.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.740
Okay, so we need
to find a new way

06:46.865 --> 06:48.408
to weave these ideas together

06:48.533 --> 06:50.659
so it represents
all of you as a team.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.579
-Let's go ahead.
-Emergency. Code everything.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.581
Hey. Whoa. Hi.
What's the emergency?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.291
What? Are you crazy?
That's me to know.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.001
Now move your ass,
you leggy bitch!

06:58.084 --> 07:00.420
Uh, okay.
Let's keep discussing this.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.588
I'll circle back to it later.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.132
Proud of you. Slay you, horse.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.550
[laughing] Okay.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.886
I'm sorry. That's...
I... I just apologize.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.096
The high energy sincerity
doesn't come naturally to me,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.140
but I'm doing
the best I can. Bye.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.516
[man breathing heavily]

07:13.600 --> 07:15.560
Oh, thank God
you're here. [chuckles]

07:15.643 --> 07:16.895
-Please take her home.
-[monitor beeping]

07:17.020 --> 07:19.189
-[man breathing heavily]
-Babs! Finally, I...

07:19.272 --> 07:20.607
Wait, wait. Who are you?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.359
I'm Alysia. Babs's roommate.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.277
Babs has a roommate?

07:24.402 --> 07:26.613
[man gasps]

07:26.738 --> 07:29.991
I never thought
when I saw 17 desperate
texts and voicemails

07:30.075 --> 07:34.120
from Swim Team Harley
on Babs's phone
it'd be the Harley Quinn.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.414
Ugh, if this was a year ago,
I'd be losing my mind.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.832
You used to be
this totally kick ass,
queer villain,

07:38.917 --> 07:40.835
and now you're
in the Bat Family.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.671
-I used to look up to you.
-Really?

07:42.754 --> 07:46.299
I have a framed photo
of you killing a guy
with an acai bowl.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.093
You were always so you.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.095
It really helped me
while I was transitioning.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.263
Hey. Hey.
I'm the one who should be
disappointed here.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.224
-Okay? Where's Babs?
-Babs will be back.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.601
She's always disappearing
for a day or two at a time.

07:56.685 --> 07:57.686
-Promise?
-Yep.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.645
Where am I taking you?

07:58.770 --> 08:00.105
To the Gotham Zoo.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.191
I need some help
from a couple of old friends.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.986
-[hyenas chittering]
-Uh, Batgirl, Nightwing,

08:07.112 --> 08:10.281
-Robin!
-What took you so long?

08:10.365 --> 08:12.450
Meet two
special friends of mine.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.911
My new and improved eyeballs.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.996
These peepers can
now fight crime
any time of day.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.624
Sunrise, sunset, magic hour,
witching hour, happy hour.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.459
Batgirl is missing.

08:21.543 --> 08:22.544
[Harley gasps]

08:22.627 --> 08:23.753
Okay, what's the emergency?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.422
It's you.
You're a PR disaster.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.717
What are you talking about?
I was a huge hit on the moon.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.844
I mean, look at all these
congratulatory gifts.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.722
Someone sent me
a contagion in an orchid.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.806
So what? Who cares?

08:34.931 --> 08:36.140
Villains are already your base.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.558
What about
the rest of the world?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.977
You said
you like your coffee black.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.812
Honey, you just lost
the almond milk market.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.023
Oh, my God.
Look what Tom Colicchio
just posted.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.983
Wait, Tom Colicchio said
something about me

08:45.108 --> 08:45.942
No, about steak.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.110
But he should be
talking about you

08:47.193 --> 08:49.195
and your
deliciously evil plans.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.822
Don't worry, we're here
to help you, but we need
to start right away.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.449
You haven't posted since 2017

08:52.532 --> 08:53.742
when you said
"I want a bagel."

08:53.825 --> 08:55.869
It was for
a free bagel contest.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.370
That you didn't even win.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.872
You know what would
make you a winner? New hair.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.623
-Would you wear a wig?
-A big one.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.625
How attached are you
to the top 10 layers
of your skin.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.378
Guys, loving getting
my appearance critiqued,

09:05.503 --> 09:06.838
but gotta get back to work.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.590
You interrupted me
while I was with my mentees.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.342
Yes. Plural. I got three.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.052
Influencing
the next generation is
totes crucial, babe,

09:12.177 --> 09:14.763
but three people
isn't a good use of your time.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.514
Imagine mentoring
three billion people.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.059
B... Billion? Like with a B?

09:19.142 --> 09:22.354
-All you have to do is
a few small things.
-Teeny, tiny things.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.439
Like throwing out
the first pitch
at a Gotham Knights game.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.524
And a call with Lorne Michaels
about hosting SNL.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.110
All the white 14-year-olds
who watch it will love you.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.029
You deserve to be
up on a pedestal.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.698
The lights shining down on you,
searing your retinas.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.034
Everyone listening
to what you have to say.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.660
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[Poison Ivy chuckles]

09:37.744 --> 09:39.245
-Okay, now a little riskier.
-[Poison Ivy] Ah!

09:39.371 --> 09:40.580
Yep. Get into it.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.873
Smile with your hair,
not your teeth.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.540
Give us passionate,
but carefree,

09:43.625 --> 09:46.086
like you just won
a bagel contest.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.004
-Yes. Okay. Yeah.
-[Jon 2] Yes, love it.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.090
-Choke me, Daddy.
-Strike a pose
that'll sing in marble.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.885
Guys, this is super fun.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.388
And wearing gold underwear
has definitely made me more,

09:56.471 --> 09:59.057
I guess, confident.
But are you sure that,

09:59.140 --> 10:01.976
like a statue of me
isn't too much too soon?

10:02.060 --> 10:03.728
-[Jons] No, no, no.
-Look at Santa Claus.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.230
That pasty bitch is everywhere.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.690
Do you think his fans
feel like it's "too much?"

10:06.773 --> 10:08.233
And check out the favorables.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.151
Statues are incredibly popular
with our target demo.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.736
Uh, who? Everyone.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.738
Unless, I don't know,
you don't believe
in science, and data,

10:13.822 --> 10:16.741
and professionals,
who've been doing this
for 5,000 years.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.618
I can't believe you got
cosmetic surgery,

10:18.743 --> 10:21.287
-when someone
is picking off the Bat Family,
-Ow!

10:21.413 --> 10:24.624
I've had an ingrown toenail
for six years,

10:24.749 --> 10:27.752
and I've never
even changed the bandage.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.379
Take a look. See?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.464
It's disgusting,

10:31.589 --> 10:33.008
Okay, Robin's not picked off.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.010
His mommy took him
to do poisons training.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.095
And I talked to Alysia,
Batgirl's roommate,

10:37.220 --> 10:39.597
she said she always disappears
for days at a time.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.683
Yeah, to be with us.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.476
Oh, fuck!

10:43.601 --> 10:44.853
-All right. What are
we gonna do?
-Oh, What are we gonna do?

10:44.936 --> 10:46.855
What are we go...
Huh? [screams]

10:46.938 --> 10:48.523
[hyenas growling]

10:48.606 --> 10:49.858
My book of clues!

10:49.941 --> 10:51.276
DId you put them up to this?

10:51.359 --> 10:52.736
Are you feeding Ivy info?

10:52.819 --> 10:56.948
I left a fucking pillow-top
Cali king and my one true love

10:57.073 --> 10:58.908
to live in this creepy mansion.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.412
I got my eyes done for you.
I am all in.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.122
Now, let's go find Batgirl.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.958
I'm gonna investigate alone
so I can actually be effective.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.626
-But we're family!
-No.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.504
No, no, no, no.
Me, Robin and Batgirl
are a family.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.299
You're just Harley.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.633
[sighs]

11:15.759 --> 11:17.844
[hyenas chittering]

11:17.969 --> 11:19.429
-Poison Ivy.
-[audience applauding]

11:19.512 --> 11:20.889
What brings you to Tawny today?

11:20.972 --> 11:23.308
Well, Tawny,
I'm just delighted to be here

11:23.391 --> 11:26.227
to talk about my socially
conscious evil campaign.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.395
That sounds great.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.148
But I heard you had
something else going on.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.984
Something not quite
set in stone.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.237
Oh, that. Um, I...
Well, I guess, yeah.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.282
In some ways, I'm here
to promote a statue.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.368
[cheering]

11:41.493 --> 11:42.827
Yeah, you are girl!

11:42.911 --> 11:44.245
[chuckles] We have an exclusive

11:44.329 --> 11:46.122
with the mold makers
who are going to reveal

11:46.206 --> 11:47.832
what brand of medical ointment

11:47.915 --> 11:50.377
they put on Ivy's lips
while that plaster dried.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.754
I think it was like
a mayo packet
from the bottom of my purse.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.922
-Mmm, mmm, mmm.
-[audience exclaims]

11:54.005 --> 11:55.674
You are so down to earth.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.676
Literally, throw those vines!

11:57.801 --> 11:59.260
Mmm-hmm.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.428
Oh. [clears throat]

12:01.429 --> 12:02.681
[cheering]

12:02.764 --> 12:04.474
All right, all right, y'all.
Settle down, settle down.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.852
[chuckling] The moment
we've all been waiting for.

12:07.977 --> 12:12.732
The world premiere
of Statue Cam.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.318
[all cheering] Statue Cam!
Statue Cam!

12:15.402 --> 12:16.653
Hey, Tawny. Just sidebar.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.530
Do people really care
about like a block of stone

12:18.613 --> 12:20.657
and three dudes
just wearing Carhartt jackets?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.034
It's like they're not
even wearing them
in like a cool, gay way.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.744
They're wearing them
in like a Boston way.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.955
Incredible!

12:27.038 --> 12:28.957
And when we come back,
one lucky audience member

12:29.040 --> 12:31.459
is going to go home
with a bag of dust

12:31.543 --> 12:33.336
from the statue herself.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.172
[audience cheering]

12:40.802 --> 12:42.012
Nightwing,
what are you doing there?

12:42.095 --> 12:44.097
Oh, I was actually
just leaving.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.099
I got all the evidence I need.

12:46.224 --> 12:50.145
Have fun, though.
Cheering for
your evil girlfriend.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.105
You have fun
not being invited
to the green room

12:52.230 --> 12:54.566
and not getting
unlimited tiny water bottles.

12:54.649 --> 12:55.775
Harley, my love.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.402
Okay. I had no idea
you were coming,

12:57.527 --> 12:59.070
but did you
just see me out there?

12:59.154 --> 13:00.739
It was crazy.
People were, like, loving me.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.365
A man gave this to me.

13:02.449 --> 13:06.161
This is my favorite sandwich
from childhood.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.038
Hey, babe, that's awesome.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.416
Did you meet the parrot
that Tawny uses
to prank celebrities?

13:11.499 --> 13:12.500
I was about to.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.461
I know we said
we weren't gonna do this.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.255
But did one
of your LOD villains
kidnap Batgirl?

13:17.339 --> 13:19.758
Okay. Is that why you're here?
You're not here to support me?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.551
I am so happy for you!

13:21.634 --> 13:24.095
But I'm also investigating
the disappearance
of my coworker.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.847
You know I can't
help you with that.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.975
So, I'll tell you
what I can help you with,
which is swag bags.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.895
Ivy, heroes can't
accept payola. God!

13:31.978 --> 13:33.229
-[screams]
-[parrot shrieks]

13:33.313 --> 13:34.564
[squawks] Gotcha bitch!
Gotcha bitch!

13:34.647 --> 13:36.441
Gotcha bitch!
Gotcha bitch! [squawks]

13:36.566 --> 13:38.943
Oh, damn, Jeffrey.
You are good.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.112
Jeffrey, my angel.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.282
I'm gonna kill
whoever left this door open.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.119
[cars honking]

13:48.203 --> 13:50.163
-[Harley snoring]
-[door opens]

13:51.289 --> 13:52.790
-Oh, shit!
-[Harley gasps]

13:52.874 --> 13:53.875
-[hyenas chitter]
-Harley.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.627
What are you doing here?

13:55.710 --> 13:57.253
Babs is missing!
I was looking through
her stuff for clues

13:57.337 --> 13:59.047
and then laid down
for a very tiny...

14:00.131 --> 14:01.132
Eight-hour nap?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.634
Wait. She hasn't come back yet?

14:02.717 --> 14:04.344
Listen, I need help.
The only thing I found out

14:04.469 --> 14:05.762
from snooping is that
she doesn't own a vibrator.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.138
-Explains a lot.
-It makes sense.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.307
Well, I didn't want
to invade her privacy.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.310
But since you already
ransacked her room,
slept in her bed,

14:12.435 --> 14:15.814
and are wearing
her "Gordon Family
Reunion 2014" shirt,

14:15.897 --> 14:17.023
let's look at her phone.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.109
A charge
at Jill's Guns and Ammo?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.902
Babs hates guns and ammo.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.654
And it's all the way up
in the mountains,

14:22.737 --> 14:25.824
A classic kidnapping spot.
I have got to go save her.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.159
My swim team has
to respect me after that.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.995
These swim team dynamics
are insane.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.497
You should come with me.
Please come with me.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.165
You know Babs so well.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.667
Okay, but only
because you're
basically a cop now,

14:35.792 --> 14:38.712
and I don't want
any brown people getting hurt.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.171
Okay, ground breaking news.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.631
You're back in
with almond milk.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.174
It'll be great press
ahead of your book launch.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.676
Wait, what?
I didn't write a book.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.428
Oh, we wrote one or you.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.304
It's called Poison Thrivy:
From Zero to #GirlBossHero.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.516
You got blurbs
from Anti-Monitor
and Jonathan Franzen?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.518
It's already number one
on the Gotham Times
best seller list.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.020
So get signing, girl.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.271
This one's for Jason Lee.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.064
This one's
for Jennifer Jason Leigh.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.025
And this one's for
Samuel Jennifer Jason Lee.
There you go.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.317
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.111
Uh, did you
look at our new plan?

15:03.194 --> 15:05.363
Oh, shoot. I... not yet.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.741
I've been swamped,
uh, um... [grunts]

15:07.866 --> 15:10.326
Uh, oh, we were thinking,
since you've gotten so big,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.412
maybe our plans
should get bigger, too.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.581
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

15:14.706 --> 15:15.707
Uh, bigger.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.667
We could double the lava flow.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.962
If I force it into the ocean,
we could create
a whole new Gotham.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.797
It's like talking to a rock,

15:22.881 --> 15:26.551
if rocks were shitty listeners
with perfect complexions.

15:26.634 --> 15:30.805
-Let's go.
-All right, guys. Good talk.
Plan sounds great.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.390
-I'm back!
-Oh, hey!

15:32.474 --> 15:34.225
I didn't realize you were gone.
Where'd you go?

15:34.351 --> 15:35.727
I've been gone for three days.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.187
I was visiting my sick sister.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.564
She was either
over watered or underwatered.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.566
-They're running tests.
-Oh, thoughts and prayers.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.110
-Does she want a book?
-Sure. Sign it to Sally.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.320
Her name is Sally.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.947
You signed it to "Zazzy."

15:48.073 --> 15:49.616
I don't have
a sister named Zazzy.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.785
No one does. Damn it, Ivy.
What's going on with you?

15:51.910 --> 15:53.536
What's going on with me
is that I'm killing it.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.997
Really? 'Cause I barely
recognize you anymore,

15:56.081 --> 15:57.790
and not just because
of the incredible amount

15:57.915 --> 15:59.250
of brow liner you're wearing.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.503
What is that?
Electrical tape. Yeesh!

16:05.423 --> 16:08.093
What's up, dudes?
Wanna get drinks?
First round's on you.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.637
I may be old,
but I'm not old fashioned.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.138
I think women should pay.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.723
We're not all women, dude.

16:13.807 --> 16:17.644
Hmm? Well, I do not know
how to course correct.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.814
Well, I don't know how
to continue this conversation

16:20.939 --> 16:22.774
without making your face flat.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.609
I'm sick of this old mug, too.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.568
-[Gordon laughs]
-[spits]

16:26.194 --> 16:27.612
[Gordon screams]

16:27.737 --> 16:29.072
[all laughing]

16:29.155 --> 16:31.199
Didn't feel that
on my penis at all.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.284
It's been a long day.
We're all just heading home.

16:33.368 --> 16:38.123
Same. I'm now getting
into my not repossessed car
and driving to my house

16:38.248 --> 16:40.125
that I definitely
still live in.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.669
Walk, walk,
walk, walk, walking.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.808
[uplifting music playing]

16:56.933 --> 16:58.184
[Harley laughs]

17:00.812 --> 17:03.440
I can still see you.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.691
Wow.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.984
You're LASIK worked, honey.
You're incredible.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.530
Nightwing must be blown away
by everything you're doing
for the Bat Family.

17:10.655 --> 17:11.573
[screaming]

17:11.656 --> 17:12.574
Harley, wake up!

17:12.656 --> 17:14.159
[Harley screaming]

17:16.661 --> 17:18.663
[hyenas chittering]

17:18.747 --> 17:20.330
[wind howling]

17:20.415 --> 17:23.251
[shudders] We are
so close to saving Babs.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.627
Not stupid Dick Grayson,
the worst teammate ever.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.798
You know he wanted to swim
the 200-meter butterfly alone?

17:28.882 --> 17:30.383
You know what?
I think we should talk about

17:30.508 --> 17:32.761
your sleepwalking
and how it almost killed us.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.637
I used to do it too
before I came out.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.891
I was spending so much energy
repressing a part of myself.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.434
Could it be similar for you?

17:39.517 --> 17:42.604
No. No. Everyone knows
I'm gay bones for Ivy.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.689
Maybe repressing
your villain side.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.693
[ice villains laughing]

17:48.777 --> 17:50.195
Is that Captain Cold?

17:50.278 --> 17:51.863
[laughing]

17:51.946 --> 17:53.698
I can see at night!

17:53.782 --> 17:57.285
[gasps] Oh, my God.
Those ici-cunts took Babs.

17:57.869 --> 17:58.703
[grunting]

18:01.873 --> 18:03.291
Where is she?

18:03.375 --> 18:05.835
Who? We're just here
for our annual cold boys trip.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.003
[all cheering]

18:07.087 --> 18:09.130
Bullshit! Where is Babs?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.258
[grunting]

18:14.886 --> 18:15.720
Ha!

18:18.890 --> 18:19.724
[grunts]

18:22.560 --> 18:23.478
Ya!

18:25.730 --> 18:27.148
[chittering]

18:28.024 --> 18:28.858
[growls]

18:36.282 --> 18:37.534
[Harley grunts]

18:39.160 --> 18:41.454
Being cold is
not a personality.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.207
Yes, Vintage Harley.
Eat his eyes.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.750
-[Barbara] Harley?
-[Harley gasps]

18:45.834 --> 18:46.751
Babs?

18:46.876 --> 18:49.462
[hyenas chittering
and growling]

18:50.672 --> 18:51.631
[slurping]

18:53.758 --> 18:55.051
A statue of moi.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.761
It's about goddamn time.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.722
Where in the world
did they find a chisel

18:58.805 --> 19:01.433
sharp enough
to capture this
granite jawline?

19:01.558 --> 19:03.476
Ah, time to eat
your vegetables, Gordo.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.145
Come to...
Oh, my God.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.022
It's still cold,
and there's a hair on it.

19:07.105 --> 19:10.275
Yuck! Oh, that's okay.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.693
Just because
one potato is gone.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.404
Doesn't mean
you're... all alone.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.031
-[machine powers up]
-Wh... What the...

19:16.114 --> 19:19.451
-[machine powers down]
-Okay, Terra, you pranked me.

19:19.534 --> 19:22.787
Come on out, Volcana. Tefe.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.789
Well, joke's on you
because now I've got

19:24.873 --> 19:27.917
a second potato
and my life is full.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.462
[owl hooting]

19:30.587 --> 19:32.380
Can you still tell Dick
I saved you?

19:32.464 --> 19:33.798
[scoffs] She didn't
need saving.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.467
Though it is a better story
than me coming up

19:35.550 --> 19:37.969
to rescue my mom,
who was abandoned by my dad,

19:38.094 --> 19:39.471
and then my mom abandoning me

19:39.596 --> 19:41.306
to go party
with the ice villains.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.600
-You okay?
-Yeah.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.477
Sorry I didn't tell you.
I was in a hurry.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.604
I forgot my cell.
Then I got snowed in.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.398
Wait a minute.
What about the charges
to Jill's Guns and Ammo?

19:50.482 --> 19:52.442
Jills is the only
grocery store up here.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.652
[gasps] Jill makes
amazing quiche.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.946
-You want some?
-Finally, someone
offers me quiche.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.115
Whoever gets the slice
with the ammo in it

19:59.199 --> 20:00.909
gets good luck till first thaw.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.827
Mmm. You know,
Dick wouldn't even work
with me to find you.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.662
Are you really
surprised by that?

20:04.746 --> 20:07.040
I thought we were a family
who saved the world together

20:07.165 --> 20:09.209
by swimming
really fast laps.

20:09.334 --> 20:12.504
You can't force things
to fit the image
you had in your mind.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.382
But I gave up everything
to join the swim team.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.716
I wanted it to be perfect,

20:16.841 --> 20:19.511
like the 2014
Gordon family reunion.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.596
Okay. Did you not
hear what I said?

20:21.680 --> 20:24.516
My dad abandoned
my mom here,
and my mom asked me

20:24.599 --> 20:26.351
to look up, "Does lube freeze?"

20:26.476 --> 20:28.269
-Does it?
-[both] If it's water-based.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.979
[scoffs] Okay.
That's not the point.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.524
It takes more
than a fight with some
CleggBnB guests

20:32.607 --> 20:35.193
and a friendship bracelet
to become part of a family.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.528
Just give it some time.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.196
Are there any
party drugs in this cabin?

20:38.321 --> 20:41.366
-No.
-I'm gonna go see
what's up with the cold boys.

20:43.076 --> 20:46.746
-[drum roll playing]
-We are so excited
to usher in Revolution Ivy.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.874
[crowd gasps]

20:52.419 --> 20:54.713
I love it. I...
I know... I... I... I...

20:54.838 --> 20:56.214
-Wow!
-Stop the presses.

20:56.339 --> 20:57.716
Look what Tom Colicchio
just posted.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.551
"Ivy's statue
is giving me life!

20:59.634 --> 21:01.720
How do I become a part
of Socially Conscious Evil?

21:01.845 --> 21:04.055
Ivy, DM me, come judge,
an Elimination Challenge."

21:04.180 --> 21:05.056
[chuckles] Okay, That's good.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.182
Oh, my God.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.809
We went through with the plan.

21:07.892 --> 21:08.893
Thought you should know.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.812
Since you weren't there
to see it.

21:10.895 --> 21:14.691
-How'd it go?
-It was a disaster
and not the good kind.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.484
We could've used some guidance.

21:16.568 --> 21:18.653
But we can totally fix
what went wrong.

21:18.737 --> 21:21.364
Maybe tomorrow
we can all meet up
and discuss?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.616
Guys, hey, look.
I want to keep mentoring you.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.869
I do. But I... I have
a responsibility

21:25.952 --> 21:30.165
To try to reach the other
2.9997 billion people

21:30.248 --> 21:32.459
who also look up to me. Right?

21:32.584 --> 21:34.419
-Nice.
-Thank you so much.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.962
Ivy totes loves your support.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.130
-Here's a book
for you three to split.
-[grunts]

21:37.255 --> 21:39.090
Wow.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.593
Who wants to crouch
next to me, crouching next
to the crouching statue?

21:41.676 --> 21:42.761
-Hands up?
-[crowd cheering]

21:44.679 --> 21:47.223
-[crowd clamoring]
-[man] Validate me!

21:47.307 --> 21:48.850
[Harley shuddering]

21:50.435 --> 21:52.687
This is... This is so nice.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.606
My teeth are
chattering so hard,

21:54.731 --> 21:56.941
it's like I'm chewing
on cruise control.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.526
[gasps] Look!

21:58.610 --> 22:01.363
There's a fawn licking
morning dew drops off a leaf.

22:01.446 --> 22:02.989
-[clanks]
-Ow! Ammo.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.909
You're gonna have good luck
for the next 28 to 49 days.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.410
Should we get
the almanac and check?

22:07.494 --> 22:08.953
[gasps] Oh, my God!

22:09.079 --> 22:13.708
Nightwing's here. [gasps]
And he's wearing my bracelet.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.129
[both screaming]

22:20.799 --> 22:22.008
[theme music playing]
