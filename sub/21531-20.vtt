WEBVTT

00:07.275 --> 00:10.078
I guess we beat Will back
from the funeral home.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.180
I can't believe
he stayed so composed

00:12.280 --> 00:13.781
during his father's eulogy.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.350
Especially since the last time
they saw each other

00:16.450 --> 00:17.551
was that huge fight.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.089
Well, Marilyn totally
kept it together, too.

00:21.189 --> 00:24.692
Will really is
his mother's son.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.261
I mean, they actually
have similar bodies.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.399
Except Will's wrists
are a little smaller.

00:31.499 --> 00:36.170
I feel so badly for his
little gay nephew Jordie.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.738
He was
just so upset.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.274
Jordie.
Which one was he?

00:40.374 --> 00:46.247
The nine year-old with
the little black funeral shawl.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.250
You know,
sang Sunrise, Sunset.
Oh.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.185
So touching.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.122
Then you're gonna love it
the next time Stan dies

00:54.222 --> 00:57.291
and I sing
Happy Days Are Here Again.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.727
[groaning]

00:59.827 --> 01:02.530
[groan] I suppose
I could tolerate it

01:02.630 --> 01:09.069
if he just wasn't coming at me
for sex every minute.

01:10.171 --> 01:14.708
Grace, would you
be willing to--
No.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.111
Oh, hey look.
Here comes Will and Marilyn.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.214
Oh, his forehead
is so shiny.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.717
I'm not going
to say anything.

01:23.817 --> 01:27.388
You know,
'cause his dad's dead.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.556
Hey, guys.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.390
We would have
gotten here sooner,

01:29.490 --> 01:31.325
but my Aunt Joanne
lost her keys.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.227
Turns out she dropped them
into the casket.

01:33.327 --> 01:37.298
Why she chose to reorganize
her purse up there is beyond me.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.168
I mean, George didn't even
like her.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.702
And now he has to spend
the rest of eternity

01:41.802 --> 01:46.207
laying next to her Pathmark
grocery card and rape whistle.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.277
Now, now, now...
Now listen--

01:49.377 --> 01:53.214
If you both need anything,
just let us know, okay?

01:53.314 --> 01:56.116
All right. Wow.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.852
That was like holding a lollipop
and a barber pole.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.890
Will, come--come sit.
Talk with us.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.326
Oh, thanks, Grace,
but the rest of the guests

02:05.426 --> 02:06.527
will be getting here
any minute.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.696
My father would want everyone
to be comfortable

02:08.796 --> 02:09.863
and to use
a coaster.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.267
Actually, that's me.
That's what I want.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.368
You know, honey--

02:15.269 --> 02:17.838
Normally my motto
is "Drugs not Hugs".

02:19.207 --> 02:20.874
But today
I feel different.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.142
Come here.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.650
Thank you, Karen.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.352
Look, guys,

02:31.452 --> 02:33.287
I appreciate that you're trying
to make me feel better.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.422
We're just
a little worried.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.689
That's all.
You know? 'Cause--

02:35.789 --> 02:37.291
'Cause--I know.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.860
'Cause I had a horrible fight
with my father before he died.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.161
But there's no point
in focusing on that.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.596
I mean, there's nothing
I can do about it.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.799
So I would just love
if today could be about

02:45.899 --> 02:47.435
celebrating his life.

02:47.535 --> 02:48.802
You really sure
that's what you want?

02:48.902 --> 02:50.170
Yes, I am.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.306
I like that.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.642
You know, Will,
I really loved your father.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.211
Um, this one time

02:57.311 --> 02:58.812
I called and told him
I was in the hospital

02:58.912 --> 03:00.748
and I needed $5,000.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.883
And he just sent it to me,
no questions.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.252
You did what?!
Shhh!

03:04.352 --> 03:07.521
We're celebrating.
We're celebrating.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.524
[upbeat jazz music]

03:10.624 --> 03:18.566
*

03:27.007 --> 03:30.978
It's nice that everybody came
to pay their respects to my dad.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.413
I know.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.415
Oh, there's Ellen.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.284
I'm gonna go say hi.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.953
Ah, I'll wait for her
to find me.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.590
Hey, guys.
Hey.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.258
Jordie, you feeling better?

03:44.358 --> 03:46.527
You look like
you really hurt your arm

03:46.627 --> 03:48.996
when you threw yourself
on the casket.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.898
I didn't even feel it.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.600
Performance adrenaline.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.403
Hey, why don't you go watch TV
with your Uncle Paul, huh?

03:55.503 --> 03:58.238
I personally think
it's a weird time to

03:58.339 --> 03:59.407
get into
a Bewitched marathon.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.575
But you can't judge
how people grieve.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.611
So, uh--

04:03.711 --> 04:05.846
How you holding up, huh?

04:05.946 --> 04:07.247
I'm okay.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.350
It's nice how many people
showed up.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.919
Oh, crap. I just made
eye contact with Ellen.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.020
Excuse me.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.856
Ellen, thank you
for coming.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.394
So, uh, I never got a chance
to congratulate you on the baby.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.995
You look terrific.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.263
Thank you, Sam.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.498
You okay?

04:24.598 --> 04:25.966
Uh, you know.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.035
It's still a shock.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.938
Didn't know whether to be brave
for Jordie and Casey,

04:31.038 --> 04:31.939
or cry it out.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.474
So I cried bravely.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.943
You know, like a man
with a low voice

04:36.043 --> 04:37.845
while I was changing
the oil on my car.

04:37.945 --> 04:43.784
And I also found out
that being drunk helps.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.286
Yeah, it's all been
very Valley of the Dolls.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.490
Oh, do you even get
that reference?

04:54.828 --> 04:55.929
Of course.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.731
It's from before
you were even born.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.300
Unless you're 40.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.970
He's not, is he?

05:03.070 --> 05:06.006
[high-pitched sounds]

05:09.009 --> 05:10.310
There, there.

05:10.411 --> 05:10.978
Let it out.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.981
Oh--Oh, no.
I wasn't crying.

05:14.081 --> 05:14.982
I was laughing.

05:15.082 --> 05:19.587
My hair
was tickling my face.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.960
That's your laugh?

05:27.060 --> 05:30.864
Sounds like
a squirrel orgy.

05:30.964 --> 05:35.102
Thanks.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.906
Oh, you're really sweet
to talk to me.

05:39.006 --> 05:45.613
When someone dies, nobody ever
asks how the mistress is doing.

05:45.713 --> 05:50.884
Yeah. Tell me about it.

05:50.984 --> 05:57.357
Not one person came up to me
at Reagan's funeral.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.529
I have a nice story
about George.

06:01.629 --> 06:05.999
Uh oh. I hope
I didn't oversell it.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.535
Hey, Will, come here!

06:07.635 --> 06:10.103
Larry's got a hilarious story
about your father!

06:10.203 --> 06:11.104
Best one
I heard all day!

06:11.905 --> 06:14.575
If this is the story
I think it is,

06:14.675 --> 06:15.843
you better embellish.

06:15.943 --> 06:19.713
I am very stressed right now,
and you are not helping me.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.014
Okay.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.883
Yeah.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.486
Hey, guys.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.620
Hey, Will.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.021
I haven't seen Grace.
Is she here?

06:28.121 --> 06:30.624
Gee, Ellen,
I'm not sure.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.559
So, Larry,
what's the story?

06:32.860 --> 06:36.096
Well, the last time
I saw your father,

06:36.196 --> 06:37.965
he said the kindest thing
to me.

06:38.065 --> 06:42.069
He said, "Larry, my friend,
that is quite a sweater."

06:45.573 --> 06:48.408
That's it?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.744
That's your story?

06:51.779 --> 06:54.014
That stunk.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.415
Supposed to make him feel better
about his dad,

06:55.516 --> 06:57.985
not worse
about his friends.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.822
Oh, hi, Casey.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.023
Where's grandpa?

07:03.123 --> 07:07.027
Oh. Um--

07:07.127 --> 07:11.031
Well, the truth is--

07:11.131 --> 07:14.668
Grandpa George is gone.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.037
Well, no, he's not gone.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.508
His spirit will
be with you forever.

07:24.111 --> 07:32.520
A spirit is kind of
like a ghost.

07:35.055 --> 07:40.494
So even though your dead
grandpa's body is underground...

07:43.263 --> 07:47.167
his ghost is...

07:47.267 --> 07:52.506
is going to be
with you forever.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.775
In your house.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.479
At school.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.518
Wherever you go.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.719
Understand?

08:08.656 --> 08:12.626
Man, I rocked that.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.127
The last time
I saw Grandpa,

08:14.227 --> 08:16.229
we played baseball
in the backyard.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.998
Well, we played
A League of Their Own.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.232
He was Tom Hanks.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.169
I was everybody else.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.238
That's wonderful, Jordie.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.608
Another great
last moment with my dad.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.243
Really, I can't
hear enough of them.

08:30.343 --> 08:36.717
You know, you really do kinda
look like Rosie O'Donnell.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.852
Yeah, I get that a lot.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.755
Well, more so
when I had my natural color.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.726
Yeah, I knew
it was a dye job.

08:45.826 --> 08:50.063
Hey, next time,
don't forget the eyebrows.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.633
Sloppy.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.868
Um, Grace.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.670
What'd you say
to Casey?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.171
She's hiding
in the closet crying

08:58.271 --> 09:00.674
because she thinks the ghost
of her dead grandfather

09:00.774 --> 09:03.210
is chasing her.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.212
What?

09:05.312 --> 09:06.980
No.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.549
No. All I said
to her was that

09:09.650 --> 09:12.052
the ghost
is watching her.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.087
Oh, yes.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.189
Yes, that is different.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.125
Oh, Sam,
I'm so sorry.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.660
I didn't mean
to scare her.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.262
God, I have--

09:22.362 --> 09:23.363
I have no idea
how to talk to kids.

09:23.463 --> 09:29.336
This thing's gonna want to talk
now and then, right?

09:29.436 --> 09:31.238
Listen, you just
have to learn

09:31.338 --> 09:32.940
to sugarcoat things
a little bit, you know?

09:33.040 --> 09:37.277
Like, for instance, I didn't
tell Casey that Mommy and Daddy

09:37.377 --> 09:40.247
were getting a divorce because
her mother was a crazy bitch.

09:40.347 --> 09:44.351
No. I just said
that Mommy is a princess

09:44.451 --> 09:46.687
who's going to live
with a prince,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.221
who's got a brokerage firm
in Pelham

09:48.321 --> 09:50.590
and used to be
daddy's best friend.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.993
I think I got it.

09:53.093 --> 09:57.597
Uh, thank God I stopped before
I said he was wrapped in chains.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.340
Vince, hi.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.777
Hey. I thought
I'd stop by.

10:09.877 --> 10:10.978
I hope that's okay.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.346
I was at the funeral, too,
but I sat in the back

10:13.380 --> 10:13.981
'cause I came in late.

10:14.748 --> 10:18.218
I went to
the wrong funeral first.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.988
I thought your dad was black
for like 20 minutes.

10:21.088 --> 10:24.391
Well, thank you
for coming.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.392
It means a lot.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.227
What happened
to your hand?

10:27.327 --> 10:29.362
It's no big deal.
You know.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.999
I accidentally got shot
by my partner.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.067
You know, you both need
to be really clear

10:34.167 --> 10:35.635
what side you land on
when you're having

10:35.736 --> 10:36.403
the "Let me pick the lock,"

10:37.170 --> 10:39.306
"No, let me shoot it off"
debate.

10:42.209 --> 10:47.080
I guess that's a lesson
you needed to learn twice.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.217
You know, the service
was really beautiful.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.985
It must have
felt really comforting

10:52.085 --> 10:53.854
to hear all those
really nice things

10:53.954 --> 10:55.422
everybody had to say
about your father.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.291
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.893
[clears throat] Will you
excuse me a minute?

10:59.993 --> 11:02.930
Uh, sure.

11:03.030 --> 11:06.033
Oh. Hey, Vince.
[screaming]

11:06.133 --> 11:07.334
Oh. Okay. [screaming]

11:07.434 --> 11:08.769
Good to see you, too.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.905
So listen,
I'm really glad you're here.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.741
I'm not so sure
Will is.

11:13.841 --> 11:14.775
You know,
I think I'm gonna go.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.177
No, no, no.
I need you.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.379
I'm gonna be playing
a cop in a new TV show

11:19.479 --> 11:21.348
and I would love
some pointers.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.850
The only cop things
I've ever done

11:22.950 --> 11:25.285
are use handcuffs
and say to somebody,

11:25.385 --> 11:30.057
"Do you have any idea
how fast you were going?"

11:31.458 --> 11:35.162
[laughing]

11:35.262 --> 11:36.463
What's going on?

11:36.563 --> 11:37.798
Rob just told
the funniest story

11:38.732 --> 11:40.233
about the last time
he saw your father.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.401
Rob's got a story.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.936
Great. Super.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.105
You okay?
I'm fine.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.139
How about you, Will?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.408
You must have a funny story
about your dad.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.442
No, no, no.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.979
Come on.
[nagging]

11:52.079 --> 11:53.080
All right,
I got a story.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.281
Uh, I think--
think you're all

11:54.381 --> 11:55.715
gonna get a kick
out of this one.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.186
The last thing my father
said to me before he died

11:59.286 --> 12:00.854
was that he wished
I wasn't gay.
Will--

12:00.954 --> 12:03.023
No, no, no.
That's a great story.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.491
Obviously nobody
saw it coming.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.159
God knows I didn't.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.362
And the best part is that's
the moment that I'm stuck with

12:09.462 --> 12:10.864
for the rest
of my life.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.141
Will, what's going on?

12:21.241 --> 12:25.946
Why would
you stop there?

12:26.046 --> 12:29.316
You had to know
I was coming after you.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.352
Really? You're gonna
blame this on me?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.420
Today?

12:33.520 --> 12:34.822
I'm not blaming you.

12:34.922 --> 12:39.292
I'm just saying
it wasn't my fault.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.062
Look, the fight you had
with your father

12:42.162 --> 12:45.432
does not define
your entire relationship.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.067
I mean,
think about it.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.269
You and I fight
all the time.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.139
There's almost
a statistical impossibility

12:52.239 --> 12:55.342
that you and I are not going
to be in a fight when we die.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.944
Don't say
statistics to me.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.079
I took your statistics
final for you.

12:59.179 --> 13:03.283
Yeah, and I still
got a C.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.885
Unless you're touring
the kitchen

13:04.985 --> 13:06.153
with the Royal
Shakespeare Company,

13:06.253 --> 13:08.121
you can knock off
the asides.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.997
No matter how it ended,
your father loved you.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.432
You know that.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.101
He said he wished
I wasn't gay, Grace.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.936
That's me.
I'm gay.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.938
He wished
I wasn't me.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.073
And I can't
forgive him for that.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.875
Okay, okay.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.209
I--I understand
that you're upset.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.345
But do you think
that you might also be upset

13:32.445 --> 13:36.083
because you can't
forgive yourself?

13:36.183 --> 13:38.151
For what?

13:38.251 --> 13:39.186
I don't know.

13:39.286 --> 13:43.156
For not forgiving him
when you had the chance.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.894
Thank you, Grace.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.295
Now on top
of everything else,

13:48.395 --> 13:49.897
I get
to feel guilty.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.264
That is not
what I was trying to--

13:51.364 --> 13:52.565
No, listen--
you know--

13:52.665 --> 13:54.234
I love you.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.836
And you're
probably right.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.305
But I just--
It makes me feel worse.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.109
This is so great.

14:02.209 --> 14:06.379
All of us together
sharing stories.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.248
I love you, honey.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.383
Rob, why do you always
have to ruin the moment?

14:10.483 --> 14:13.253
God.

14:13.353 --> 14:18.125
You know, Marilyn,
my husband may not be dead,

14:18.225 --> 14:21.962
but my love
for him is.

14:23.596 --> 14:28.068
So if you ever need
a drinking buddy,

14:28.168 --> 14:30.103
I'll drink with ya.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.539
Or if you ever
need a shoulder

14:32.639 --> 14:39.146
to cry on,
I'll drink with ya.

14:39.246 --> 14:42.415
I guess what I'm trying
to say is

14:42.515 --> 14:45.318
I love to drink.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.321
Oh, thank you, Karen.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.890
You'll get a call.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.292
Oh!

14:52.392 --> 14:54.194
Oh, no, Tina!
Tina, please.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.064
You don't have
to sneak out of here

14:57.164 --> 14:59.199
like you just heard my car
pull up in the driveway.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.005
I'm sorry.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.339
I shouldn't have come.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.374
Oh, no, no, no.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.309
I'm really glad
that you're here.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.646
After all, we both lost
someone we loved, hmm?

15:18.118 --> 15:22.189
Thank you for being
George's companion during--

15:22.289 --> 15:25.258
During those years
in the middle

15:25.358 --> 15:27.360
when he put on
a little weight.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.263
Oh, no problem.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.399
Truth is, I kinda like 'em
a little fat.

15:40.473 --> 15:45.112
Excuse me, miss,
how fat are you willing to go?

15:46.613 --> 15:51.518
Casey, I was wrong
about Grandpa.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.453
He's not a ghost.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.522
He's up in heaven.

15:55.622 --> 16:01.261
And heaven is
so much better than here.

16:03.296 --> 16:08.035
You get to live on a cloud
made of cotton candy.

16:08.135 --> 16:12.672
And all you do
is play with puppies and--

16:12.772 --> 16:14.541
And eat cookies
for dinner.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.410
Here, you spend
your whole life

16:17.510 --> 16:18.545
looking for someone
to love you

16:19.479 --> 16:23.316
and most people
never find that person.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.586
So don't you worry
about Grandpa.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.389
He's the lucky one.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.624
He's dead.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.162
I've got red wine--

16:35.262 --> 16:36.629
[crying]
Oh, Mom--

16:36.729 --> 16:39.032
Will, close
the door, please.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.272
I don't think I've ever
seen you cry before.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.306
I hate crying
in front of people,

16:46.406 --> 16:47.640
so I come in here.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.743
And nobody can hear me
under the sound of the dryer.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.012
You want me to go?

16:53.113 --> 16:54.247
Maybe you should.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.582
It'll probably
take awhile 'til it--

16:55.682 --> 16:58.051
[buzzer]
Oh, there. All better.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.124
Look, Mom--

17:04.224 --> 17:05.725
I'm sorry I snapped.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.528
I just--I can't stop thinking
about the fight with dad.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.362
Oh, Will,

17:09.462 --> 17:12.299
your father
felt terrible, too.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.734
You're his son.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.336
He was so proud
of everything about you.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.371
He just got pushed
against the wall

17:18.471 --> 17:20.107
and it came out
all wrong.
I know.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.409
I know.
I just--

17:22.509 --> 17:24.177
I should've just accepted
that when it came

17:24.277 --> 17:27.314
to me being gay,
he just had limitations.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.383
No. He did, but, uh,
you know, William,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.419
you have limitations, too.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.754
What do you mean?

17:34.854 --> 17:37.357
Well look at how
that argument started.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.691
I mean, you came in
and announced,

17:38.791 --> 17:41.828
for the very first time,
that you wanted children.

17:41.928 --> 17:45.465
And then you were angry
when we were surprised.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.566
How could
you be surprised?

17:46.666 --> 17:50.803
Will, because you never
share anything with us.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.805
You never have.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.275
Really, you are
so secretive, Will.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.344
Honestly, I don't know
where you get it.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.779
Grandma, what are
you doing in here?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.248
Making cupcakes, darling.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.315
Go away.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.655
Hon, where was I?

18:08.755 --> 18:12.525
I'm secretive, and you don't
know where I get it from.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.463
Okay, well, the fact
is your father was thrilled

18:16.563 --> 18:18.165
that you wanted a baby.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.802
He was?
Yes.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.438
I only wish that you had
told us before.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.540
Told us anything
about your life.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.478
You know, you have
never introduced us

18:31.578 --> 18:33.346
to any
of your boyfriends.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.814
That lovely man Vince,

18:34.914 --> 18:38.385
why has he never been
to the house before?

18:38.485 --> 18:40.787
I don't know.

18:40.887 --> 18:47.694
Guess I just never thought
you'd want to meet them.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.762
Now it's too late.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.865
Ow. Ow, fabric softener.

18:52.965 --> 18:53.866
Ow, that stings.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.269
And softens.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.472
Here, darling.
Here, it's all right.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.540
It's all right.
Let it--

19:00.640 --> 19:03.443
Let it go, Will.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.479
You know, he's gone,
but we're not.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.349
And if we've
learned anything

19:09.449 --> 19:12.485
through all
of this is...

19:12.585 --> 19:16.389
you have to tell the people
you love how you feel

19:16.489 --> 19:18.525
while you have
the chance.

19:18.625 --> 19:22.595
I miss him
so much, Mom.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.632
[crying]
Darling--

19:29.236 --> 19:33.640
[dryer]

19:33.740 --> 19:35.608
Oh, Jack, you'd only
tell the person,

19:35.708 --> 19:36.476
"Put your hands
in the air."

19:36.576 --> 19:37.777
You wouldn't say,

19:37.877 --> 19:39.679
"And wave 'em
like you just don't care."

19:39.779 --> 19:42.949
Okay.
[sigh]

19:43.049 --> 19:44.517
I'm learning so much.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.521
Now, does "assume the position"
mean what I hope it does?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.627
Hey, guys.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.195
Hey, Will.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.564
Have you been crying?

19:57.664 --> 19:58.965
Yeah.

19:59.065 --> 20:02.535
Good. It's about time.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.375
So how you doing?

20:08.475 --> 20:10.577
Been a rough day.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.581
Listen, it's come to
my attention that, uh,

20:14.681 --> 20:17.550
I don't always express
my emotional state

20:17.650 --> 20:19.752
to the individuals
that I care about.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.889
Really? 'Cause that
was warm.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.925
Look, I miss you.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.395
A lot.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.263
When I saw you
walk in this room,

20:30.363 --> 20:31.464
I was so happy.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.800
And I just--

20:33.900 --> 20:35.668
I just wanted
to tell you that.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.370
Even though I know
you're seeing someone.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.540
Well actually, Will,
I'm not seeing anyone anymore.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.676
I miss you, too.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.350
All right.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.919
This should be everything
you need to know

20:53.019 --> 20:56.889
to have
an affair with Stan.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.958
Directions to the manse,
his security code,

20:59.058 --> 21:02.862
and, of course,
a diagram of his body.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.932
The part with the arrow
next to it

21:06.032 --> 21:07.467
is where
you'll wanna focus.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.503
Oh, thank you.

21:10.603 --> 21:10.703
I never would have guessed
to look there.
