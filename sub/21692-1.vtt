from Leopoldi's hardware,
the one-stop shop

that dead body off your hands.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.084
Whether it's
shovels, saws, or tubs of lye,

00:19.086 --> 00:22.154
Leopoldi's guarantees
they'll have what you need,

00:22.156 --> 00:23.589

like you're doing

00:23.591 --> 00:26.592
something really terrible.

01:51.344 --> 01:54.880
So Morgan, who is your pick?

01:54.882 --> 01:56.815
Hottest female
serial killer ever.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.617
That's a tough call.
- Mhm.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.752
Kristen Gilbert
had that whole boring thing

02:00.754 --> 02:01.787
going on that's kind of hot.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.255
But Myra Hindley
had great style.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.156
She did.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.556
She really did.

02:05.558 --> 02:08.193
My vote is for Josephine
"the clipper" Walker,

02:08.195 --> 02:11.663
great bone structure,
into personal hygiene,

02:11.665 --> 02:12.664
highly intelligent.

02:12.666 --> 02:13.799
Sounds like me.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.800
Highly intelligent.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.335
Cool.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.203
So I'm going to go out
on a limb, as they say,

02:18.205 --> 02:20.172
and put my money on
countess Bathory,

02:20.174 --> 02:22.141
even though it's really hard
to tell what she looks like.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.709
Well, you've always
been into mystery.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.178
And yet I dated you.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.280
And it looks like our listeners

02:28.282 --> 02:29.748
agree with me, once again.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.485
The crown goes to "the
clipper" with "bad professor"

02:33.487 --> 02:36.522
Lila Childs sliding
into a sultry second

02:36.524 --> 02:39.758
and fashion week's Myra
Hindley taking the bronze.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.793
Join us next week
as we put our $0.02

02:41.795 --> 02:43.729
into the health care
debate with our episode

02:43.731 --> 02:45.430
that takes on the nurse curse.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.432
We'll talk about why
so many lady killers

02:47.434 --> 02:49.735
had double lives as caretakers.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.736
I'm Morgan.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.770
I'm Jean.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.938
And we are...

02:52.940 --> 02:53.960
"women who kill."

02:57.610 --> 03:00.179
In 300 feet,
take a left on rolling

03:00.181 --> 03:01.580
correctional facility road.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.753
Why didn't you
tell me I had Kale in my teeth?

03:07.755 --> 03:08.954
I thought it was that tooth.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.489
What tooth?

03:10.491 --> 03:11.557
You know the one
that gets sort of gray.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.858
- Oh my god.
- What?

03:12.860 --> 03:13.825
Why do you care what
you look like anyway?

03:13.827 --> 03:15.327
It's a prison.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.495
Don't make me
feel bad about trying

03:16.497 --> 03:18.263
- to look presentable.
- I'm not.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.565
I just don't think Lila's going
to care what you look like.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.465
Great.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.800
Rub it in.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.869
We both know she's going
to respond more to you.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.370
What's that supposed to mean?

03:26.607 --> 03:27.839
You've seen the victims' photos.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.208
I mean, they all look like...

03:29.210 --> 03:30.375
- Lesbians.
- Wait.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.577
Are you saying I look like a...

03:31.579 --> 03:33.445
No, just never mind.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.648
Can I help you?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.650
Morgan hall for Lila Childs.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.252
Are you together?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.954
We're exes.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.389
She means are we here together.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.226
Oh, yeah.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.860
I'm sorry to tell you
about the Kale your teeth.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.295
I didn't want to embarrass you.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.396
No you didn't want
to embarrass you.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.596
They're your teeth.

03:52.598 --> 03:55.000
Your comfort trumps my
discomfort, as always.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.768
Nobody even saw the
Kale in your teeth,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.437
so you couldn't
have any discomfort.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.339
I need to touch your bra, ma'am.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.641
Did you already touch hers?

04:02.643 --> 04:05.410
Mm.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.712
I'm just saying
you should explore

04:06.714 --> 04:08.747
your vulnerability
issues because usually

04:08.749 --> 04:10.382
they're at my expense.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.284
Maybe my vulnerability
issues stem out of the fact

04:12.286 --> 04:14.386
that you're not comfortable
with me being vulnerable.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.387
Well, you trick people
with your boyishness.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.690
I can't help that I can
lift semi-heavy things.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.259
- Oh, shit.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.392
How do I look?
- You look beautiful.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.561
How do I look?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.029
You have something
in your teeth.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.191
Pat her down on the way back.

04:36.709 --> 04:37.676
Morgan.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.812
No contact, please.

04:40.814 --> 04:45.484
Can't tell a dyke from a
debutante these days, can you?

04:45.486 --> 04:46.785
She's bisexual.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.719
What?

04:47.721 --> 04:48.754
You are.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.989
But I don't say it out loud.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.624
Do you mind if we record?

04:52.626 --> 04:55.527
You can do anything you want.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.529
You remind me of someone.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.900
So we should get started.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.537
For each episode, we
interview a female murderer

05:05.539 --> 05:06.872
to get her side of things.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.607
Who else have you interviewed?

05:08.609 --> 05:11.343
We got a chance to speak
with Josephine Walker right

05:11.345 --> 05:12.678
before she died.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.446
Oh, she's the one
who clipped the ladies'

05:14.448 --> 05:15.447
nails right before she...

05:15.449 --> 05:16.481
Stabbed them in the heart.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.716
She was good.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.785
A little heavy on the
methodology, but I

05:19.787 --> 05:21.420
respect her conviction.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.688
We also had a...

05:22.690 --> 05:24.790
A great chat, actually,
with Debbie Cain.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.925
Oh, there's an overrated cunt.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.995
She had a higher
victim count than you do.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.865
Sweetheart, if I was
going for quantity over quality,

05:33.867 --> 05:35.801
I would have taught
at community college.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.870
Debbie is one of the most
notorious female serial killers

05:38.872 --> 05:40.038
who ever lived.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.807
I went to community college.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.843
Debbie is an entitled
slut who stole a bunch of babies

05:44.845 --> 05:47.779
and tossed them in the
trunk of her Volvo.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.915
All you have to do nowadays
to go down in history

05:49.917 --> 05:52.818
is rely on the mediocrity
of shock value.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.419
You killed 12 of your students

05:54.421 --> 05:56.621
and used their bodies as
fertilizer on the azaleas

05:56.623 --> 05:57.823
in your greenhouse.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.990
You don't call that shock value?

05:58.992 --> 06:01.927
Oh, honey, no.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.963
I call that love.

06:06.966 --> 06:09.034
Please don't make
me go to a strip club.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.402
You're already
making me wear a tux.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.436
It's my bachelor party.

06:11.438 --> 06:12.738
You're my best dyke.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.805
When have you ever
known me to wear a suit?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.474
Eh, then wear a dress.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.508
Go the bachelorette party.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.676
Talk about midwives and shit.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.176
I don't want to wear a dress.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.079
I just want to wear
something that's not a suit.

06:21.081 --> 06:24.516
This one advertises
sports, steaks, and pussy.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.550
Perfect.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.586
Speaking of pussy, how's Jean?

06:27.588 --> 06:29.388
One comment says, "slutty
bitches everywhere."

06:29.390 --> 06:30.589
You think that's good or bad?

06:30.591 --> 06:32.057
That's good.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.725
Have you guys slept
together again?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.627
Alex, please stop
bugging me about Jean, Ok?

06:35.629 --> 06:36.661
We're not getting back together.

06:36.663 --> 06:37.696
Can I say one thing?

06:37.698 --> 06:38.964
No.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.700
Enemy within,
dude, self-sabotage.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.034
You undermine shit.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.536
That's three things.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.405
I'm just saying
Jean's good for you.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.706
You are good for her.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.607
Well, I want
something more than just

06:48.609 --> 06:49.641
being good for someone.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.742
Well, that's all there is.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.643
Love isn't romance.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.811
It's survival.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.413
Survival's depressing.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.647
Not if you're
dying, technically.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.815
Mm-mm.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.916
Technically, this isn't
your conversation.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.584
Oh, shit.
- What?

06:59.586 --> 07:00.819
I got to go.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.454
I have to be early
for my co-op shift.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.822
Seriously, I'm losing
out to a grocery store.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.056
They have really great produce.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.091
Come on.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.559
What about my bachelor party?

07:07.561 --> 07:08.727
I'll book the steak
and pussy club, Ok?

07:08.729 --> 07:09.729
Bye.

07:21.575 --> 07:25.510
Oh, it's you.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.679
It's you.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.581
I love your show.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.949
When you grab her like that,

07:30.951 --> 07:32.017
she thinks I'm not good enough.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.986
Hey, Morgan, new member.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.922
She was fine
when you were looking at her.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.190
You don't know that.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.459
You need to stop putting
words in my mouth.

07:42.528 --> 07:45.163
Morgan, I need
you in orientation.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.498
Samantha's supposedly in labor.

07:47.468 --> 07:48.166
But I have a new member.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.802
No, I'll take her.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.537
I've never done an
orientation before.

07:52.539 --> 07:57.008
Morgan, I really need you
to be with me on this one, Ok?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.777
Great.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.779
Oh, make sure they know that
the earth machine was finally

08:00.781 --> 08:06.585
approved for the goddamned
urban farm, which nobody

08:06.587 --> 08:10.622
goes into without a hard hat.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.592
Hi.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.593
You do a good job.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.560
Thank you.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.962
Here, take her back.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.530
Just come here.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.499
Good job, of course.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.769
Each of you should sign up...

08:25.672 --> 08:26.672
for your shift.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.549
Each of you should sign up for
your shifts after this meeting

08:38.552 --> 08:41.285
by filling out a form
from the red binder.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.964
Remember, you are
required to volunteer

08:52.966 --> 08:56.668
three hours every four
weeks to be a member.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.603
If you miss one shift,

09:05.278 --> 09:08.547
you are required to make up two.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.863
This concludes our orientation.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.965
I would like to officially
congratulate you

09:26.967 --> 09:31.570
on being a new member of the
green hill food co-operative,

09:31.572 --> 09:33.071
happy food, happy people.

09:38.644 --> 09:39.644
Thanks.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.650
I'd like to sign up for a shift.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.652
Oh.

09:49.121 --> 09:51.690
You're supposed to go
to an orientation first.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.925
Well, you saw me
there, didn't you?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.961
Yeah, but you're required to
stay through the whole thing.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.963
Mm.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.598
Morgan, right?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
I'm Simone.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.038
Do you mind if I take a look?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.039
No one will know.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.307
But...

10:09.309 --> 10:11.042
Oh, there's a spot
left for right here.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.043
It's your shift.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.045
We can work together.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.464
Don't let me get you in trouble.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.756
Ok, just hurry.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.100
Now, you know how to reach me.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.088
All right, now, tell
us about the unicorn

10:57.090 --> 10:59.791
that you bought a few
days before the murder.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.761
Now, you had it
inscribed with a date

11:02.763 --> 11:06.231
and the names of your children.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.167
Was it a memorial?

11:09.169 --> 11:12.704
No, it was a way of
me just saying, hey,

11:12.706 --> 11:14.739
this is our new start on life.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.307
A unicorn is a type of horse.

11:16.309 --> 11:19.277
And a horse is wild and free.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.781
In your diary, you
refer to "heart love."

11:22.783 --> 11:24.315
What's that mean?

11:24.317 --> 11:26.718
It's the only love
that really matters.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.154
It isn't sexual.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.989
It's deeper than that.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.758
But in the letters, I
was over dramatizing.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.828
You're always over dramatizing.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.432
You have what's known as
a histrionic personality.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.300
What?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.622
You've never heard the results
of your psychological tests?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.276
Deviant sociopath.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.278
You know what that means?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.914
Do you think maybe we
spend too much time together?

12:00.186 --> 12:02.353
You think we spend
too much time together?

12:02.355 --> 12:07.125
Oh, I mean, just maybe we can
try to do things separately.

12:11.497 --> 12:13.064
That's probably smart, right?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.066
Right?

12:21.774 --> 12:24.509
Do you want to start now or...

12:24.511 --> 12:26.311
No, tomorrow's better for me.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.080
Me too.

12:29.082 --> 12:33.418
I'll never get over
how beautiful this park is.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.386
We're so lucky.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.855
Uh-huh.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.790
I hope the swans are here today.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.292
Hey, I think we should
head home and start working.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.094
No, let's...
Let's work outside.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.362
I brought my computer.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.531
You mean, sit on the grass?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.465
Why not?

12:47.467 --> 12:50.001
Just urine.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.936
Well, how about over here?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.104
You know, just for
a little while.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.106
Fine.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.955
All right, fine, you win.

13:10.957 --> 13:11.890
What?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.792
I saw that.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.493
Jean, I haven't
done anything yet.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.195
So you're going to deny you just

13:17.197 --> 13:19.964
did that passive aggressive
thing with your notebook?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.400
You mean, take out
my anger on my notebook

13:22.402 --> 13:24.569
because I'm actually angry at
you wanting to work outside?

13:24.571 --> 13:27.539
Great, you're mocking me.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.809
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm doing.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.210
How can you hate swans?

13:32.212 --> 13:34.379
I don't hate Sw... would
you keep your voice down?

13:34.381 --> 13:37.081
Do you know what people in park
slope would do to a swan hater?

13:37.083 --> 13:38.316
So you do hate them?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.451
I think they're a
little mean and angry.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.886
That was one swan.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.154
It gave me stitches.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.556
Why do you always
take the swan's side?

13:44.558 --> 13:47.425
Because they're animals
and animals are innocent,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.160
unlike people, who
murder and rape.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.361
You know what?

13:50.363 --> 13:51.596
Animals murder and
rape all the time.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.598
Did you hear that
cat rape last night?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.834
It was like somebody was
beating a baby really softly.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.435
That wasn't cat rape.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.937
That was a stray in heat.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.105
Well, I felt raped
just listening to it.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.574
You always change the subject.

14:02.576 --> 14:03.975
What were we talking about?

14:03.977 --> 14:05.476
I don't remember.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.011
Work.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.479
Dog urine.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.548
You slamming the notebook.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.951
Swans.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.953
Like I said, I don't hate them.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.554
I'm just a little
frightened of them.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.190
Looks like somebody took
a snake and shoved it

14:19.192 --> 14:23.061
into the shoulders
in a big white duck.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.230
I think we should just
work separately today.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.533
I... i have more work to
do on dismemberment so...

14:28.535 --> 14:30.235
Fine.

14:30.237 --> 14:34.005
I'll work on smothering
and strangulation.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.007
Fine.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.379
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

15:14.381 --> 15:18.616
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, yeah.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.151
Stella!

15:20.153 --> 15:25.123
Morgan, Morgan, Morgan,
Morgan, Morgan, Morgan,

15:25.125 --> 15:27.091
sit the fuck down.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.526
Put the hand back out.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.460
On three.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.230
1, 2, 3, go.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.231
Come on, Morgan.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.132
Come on.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.600
You got this.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.544
You're an adult woman, Morgan.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.146
What is wrong with you?

15:48.148 --> 15:50.214
Mary, come on.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.449
- What?
- Fuck you.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.051
It's makes no sense.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.285
- But he was right.
- Yeah, fuck you, man.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.553
Ah, man, you know what?

15:55.555 --> 15:56.988
Someone check this one for..

15:56.990 --> 15:57.989
Yeah, check him.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.223
You got my message.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.124
Hey.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.125
You came.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.694
Hello.

16:02.696 --> 16:06.497
If you looked just like me,
I'd tongue kiss you right now.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.498
Who are you?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.133
Simone.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.401
Someone?

16:10.403 --> 16:11.369
Simone, Al.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.371
Ah, cool.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.440
Hey, guess who I invited?

16:15.442 --> 16:16.442
Yeah.

16:18.711 --> 16:19.711
Woo.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.250
Morgan's on a date.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.986
Jean, this is...

16:27.988 --> 16:28.720
Simone.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.455
Jean's Morgan's ex.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.423
So, like, don't fuck with Jean.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.025
- I'm Kim.
- Shh.

16:34.027 --> 16:34.759
Hi.

16:34.761 --> 16:35.994
Alex.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.428
Oh, I'm coming motherfuckers.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.397
All right, Kim, you've
got your beer pong.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.367
Did you know Kim holds
the beer pong crown?

16:42.369 --> 16:44.502
Wow.
All time champ.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.738
Probably has something
to do with the alcoholism.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.072
All right.
Come on.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.340
Grab shots.
How about a seltzer.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.575
Alex, Alex, Alex.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.710
Nah, seltzer's for pussies.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.451
Sorry, Alex can be
kind of an asshole.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.120
I'll try my best not
to fuck with you, Jean.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.489
Ah, thank you.
I appreciate it.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.657
So did you
guys meet online, or...

17:07.660 --> 17:09.327
Oh god, no, no.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.361
We met at the co-op.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.695
No way.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.665
You look a true park sloper.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.733
I just moved here a
few months ago, actually.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.237
Oh, where from?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.704
All over.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.440
I came back for my
mother's funeral

17:22.442 --> 17:26.743
and just decided to stick
around, tie up some loose ends.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.047
I'm sorry about your mom.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.081
Yeah, that sucks.

17:30.083 --> 17:30.815
Thanks.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.116
We were estranged, so...

17:32.118 --> 17:33.451
I had a game.
- Morgan...

17:33.453 --> 17:34.719
Hm?

17:34.721 --> 17:37.355
Would you come talk
to Alex because she

17:37.357 --> 17:39.424
thinks that she's Batman again.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.725
I can do one more shot.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.659
I'm kind of...

17:41.661 --> 17:43.561
I'll talk to her.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.495
Thanks, Jean.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.464
Sure.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.132
It was nice meeting you, Simone.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.500
Yeah, you too.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.370
Just text me if you're
not going to come home.

17:57.743 --> 18:03.748
Um, sorry about that.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.384
It's Ok.

18:06.386 --> 18:11.222
You... you want to take
a walk through the park?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.857
Oh, right now?

18:12.859 --> 18:14.826
Yeah.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.360
I mean, we have to be careful.

18:16.362 --> 18:19.197
There's probably rapists
or gays in the woods.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.633
I'll take the rapists
if you take the gays.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.868
Oh, come on.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.570
You're not scared of
the dark, are you?

18:25.572 --> 18:26.572
No.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.381
Ok, I confess.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.383
I'm scared of the dark.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.521
It doesn't scare you?

18:43.523 --> 18:45.823
Sometimes.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.145
That doesn't mean
I don't like it.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.828
Day is full of clarity.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.163
Night is just a
bunch of nothingness.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.599
It's suffocating.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.434
Try breathing through it.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.469
No, I'm not into that.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.604
Breathing?

18:59.606 --> 19:00.905
I'm not the deep kind.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.640
I just like to take a
bunch of short ones.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.574
Mhm.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.910
So some save for later.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.246
You're slowly killing
yourself, you know?

19:10.782 --> 19:14.218
It makes me nervous
how relaxed you are.

19:14.220 --> 19:17.255
I'm not always this way.

19:17.257 --> 19:21.159
The city usually makes me
crazy after a few weeks.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.195
Oh, so you've lived here before?

19:24.197 --> 19:26.397
No, I just meant any city.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.603
Ok, now I have
something to confess.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.505
What?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.773
I know you.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.375
You do?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.177
Yeah, your show.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.179
I'm a fan.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.586
Are you sure this is safe?

19:48.588 --> 19:49.588
No.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.311
You want a drink?

20:13.313 --> 20:14.313
I'd love one.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.229
I like your place.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.297
Oh, thanks.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.532
I'm still settling in.

20:45.310 --> 20:48.379
What's in it?

20:48.381 --> 20:51.015
Just memories.

20:54.353 --> 20:55.620
I meant the drink.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.142
I don't want to know
what's in the box.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.011
Everybody wants to
know what's in the box.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.013
I don't.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.047
I thought
love was what I felt when

21:56.049 --> 21:59.517
those girls were alive but it
was when I had my hands wrapped

21:59.519 --> 22:00.584
around their necks.

22:05.824 --> 22:09.627
You didn't text last night.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.462
Fuck, I forgot.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.930
I thought love was what I felt

22:12.932 --> 22:14.699
when those girls were alive.

22:14.701 --> 22:19.570
But it was when I had my hands
wrapped around their necks.

22:19.572 --> 22:22.406
Love was when I had my hands
wrapped around their necks.

22:22.408 --> 22:25.509
I had a dream that your
body turned up in that lake,

22:25.511 --> 22:27.378
you know, where the
dogs like to play.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.448
Except it wasn't your
head on the body.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.650
It was Joaquin Phoenix.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.418
He lives in park slope now.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.920
Maybe that's it.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.422
I always though you
kind of looked like him.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.728
Seriously, I was about
to call the police.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.730
I thought the
police gave you hives.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.065
Well, that's why
I didn't call them.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.434
What's her name again?

22:50.436 --> 22:51.535
Simone.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.537
Simone what?

22:54.706 --> 22:56.440
Ellis, I think.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.576
Oh, you don't know her last
name and you slept with her?

22:58.578 --> 23:00.411
I didn't know your first
name, and I slept with you.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.413
Yes, you did.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.382
You just thought it
was pronounced "Zhon."

23:10.789 --> 23:12.523
Jean, she's not yours to Google.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.924
Come, Google with me.

23:13.926 --> 23:17.094
I don't want to.

23:17.096 --> 23:22.166
It's like the first step
in a serious relationship.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.801
Seriously, stop.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.136
Ooh.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.071
Kay.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.839
You like her.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.574
Don't make fun of me.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.842
You're just being sensitive.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.578
No, I'm genuinely curious.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.813
Well, I don't want
to share this, Ok?

23:35.815 --> 23:38.149
I want something that's mine.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.583
Ok.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.419
Fine.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.954
I won't take any
interest in your life.

23:43.956 --> 23:44.956
Thank you.

23:49.528 --> 23:50.895
Love was when I had my hands

23:50.897 --> 23:52.196
wrapped around their necks.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.097
Sorry.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.634
My hand slipped.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.579
Let's go, lips!

26:22.782 --> 26:23.847
Let's go, lips!

26:25.217 --> 26:26.717
Yeah, lips.

26:26.719 --> 26:31.255
Flick those dirty beans
until they're clean.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.224
Man, this team's
killing it this season.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.125
Strike.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.261
Eye on the ball, Jones.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.229
Keep that energy up, ladies.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.265
Let's go pitcher.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.166
You got this.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.601
You got this.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.043
You got to get a
key so she'll break.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.274
Stop fucking with your phone.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.241
Ball.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.810
You got this.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.011
Play the first.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.846
It's my crime
blotter app, actually.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.382
Then actually stop fucking
with your crime blotter app

26:58.384 --> 27:00.317
through your phone.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.652
I haven't see you
in months, dude.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.120
A girl can clock out a minute.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.088
It hasn't been months.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.823
I met Simone 49 days ago.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.157
Out.
- Motherfucker.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.292
Good job, pitcher.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.226
Way to go.

27:09.228 --> 27:13.330
49 days?

27:13.332 --> 27:15.733
What is she, an infant?

27:17.003 --> 27:18.035
Yeah, t.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.069
Good hop there, t.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.071
All right.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.040
Out.

27:23.042 --> 27:26.377
I mean, she's pretty and shit,
but that bitch has secrets.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.379
You've never even had a
real conversation with her.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.980
I don't have to.
I know her type.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.016
And she's the type that's
gone in three months.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.884
Why is everybody
so unhappy for me?

27:33.886 --> 27:35.753
I didn't treat you like
this when you met Kim.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.221
That's because when
I met Kim, I didn't

27:37.223 --> 27:38.288
pretend you didn't exist.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.763
Ball.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.731
Sorry.

27:47.733 --> 27:50.901
I just miss you.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.770
I'm sorry too.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.071
You got it.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.006
I'll make more of an effort, Ok?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.675
Maybe we can all
have dinner together.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.043
Let's go, pitcher.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.011
Yeah, I'll cook meat.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.813
Well, if you could have
some vegetarian options.

28:02.815 --> 28:03.881
- Yeah, lips.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.215
Yeah.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.183
Woo!

28:06.185 --> 28:08.686
Pound that pussy, ladies.

28:08.688 --> 28:09.920
Pound it.

28:13.124 --> 28:16.727
I was really annoyed with
what she was just talking about.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.462
Wow, you're beautiful.

28:18.464 --> 28:21.198
Oh, thanks.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.133
Do you know what
else is beautiful?

28:23.135 --> 28:24.068
Um...

28:24.070 --> 28:25.769
Compost.

28:25.771 --> 28:27.371
Would you smile
if I were to tell

28:27.373 --> 28:30.274
you that the earth machine can
compost pretty much anything?

28:30.276 --> 28:32.342
Oh, there's a smile.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.712
All right, but we have
to get serious, Ok?

28:34.714 --> 28:36.980
- Ok.
- The future is dirt.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.916
And you have to...

28:38.918 --> 28:41.385
Wait.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.288
Allison?

28:44.290 --> 28:45.322
Allison, it's me.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.324
Candice.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.063
So you hit your head?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.198
I was on the rooftop farm.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.499
I slipped.

28:55.501 --> 28:56.834
I"m going to
have you put those away.

28:56.836 --> 28:57.868
Dispatcher: EMTs want

28:57.870 --> 28:58.736
to know if we need a stretcher.

28:58.738 --> 28:59.436
You're late.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.038
You want a stretcher?

29:01.040 --> 29:02.740
You're supposed
to be five minutes early.

29:02.742 --> 29:03.974
Oh, I think your clock's fast.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.476
My phone...

29:05.478 --> 29:07.177
Or maybe your clock's just
wound a little too tight.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.378
Copy.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.214
- Morgan, phones.
- What?

29:10.216 --> 29:11.415
I was supposed to show Simone...

29:11.417 --> 29:14.284
I'll show her.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.854
Our victim is on the move,
heading out to you now.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.188
Receiving victim.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.790
Copy.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.158
Attention all members,

29:21.160 --> 29:24.762
there's been another
accident in the urban farm.

29:24.764 --> 29:27.164
Please be advised
that the area is

29:27.166 --> 29:28.966
off-limits until further notice.

29:28.968 --> 29:34.171
I repeat, the urban farm will
be closed until further notice.

29:34.173 --> 29:37.040
This is where we
keep all the backup files.

29:37.042 --> 29:41.945
Everyone who's been a member
since 1973 is in here.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.113
Seems like a waste of paper.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.449
Yeah, well, systems
go down, Simone.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.251
And when our system
goes down and all

29:47.253 --> 29:49.319
the information on
the computer is lost,

29:49.321 --> 29:51.288
guess what's going to save us?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.323
Grace's files.

29:53.325 --> 29:57.795
Go to the orange tab
and take out a file.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.397
Hold it.
Hold it, please.

30:00.399 --> 30:05.202
And you cross-reference
it on the iPad.

30:05.204 --> 30:08.071
If she's still a member, she
goes back into the drawer.

30:08.073 --> 30:12.109
But if she's no longer a
member, she's inactive.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.111
She goes into the shredder.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.250
Got it?

30:21.220 --> 30:22.820
Focus.

30:22.822 --> 30:25.022
I need two volunteers
for the super-clean shift.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.391
I've already fulfilled
my super-clean requirement.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.959
Come on.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.093
If I don't get two
volunteers in the next hour,

30:30.095 --> 30:31.361
I got to do it myself.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.130
And I already opened
and close that day.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.999
Sorry, Darren, I can't deep
clean at 4:00 in the morning.

30:36.001 --> 30:39.403
It's just that I trust
you, Morgan because you

30:39.405 --> 30:41.505
don't break the rules.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.608
For example, you wouldn't
have stolen anybody's

30:44.610 --> 30:48.145
personal information, would you?

30:48.147 --> 30:49.379
I was going to put it back.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.414
It's all good.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.949
I'll take care of that for you.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.617
You just got to fill this out.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.088
This is blackmail.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.423
It's cool.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.457
You can go back to key
foods if you want to.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.425
I'm fine with that.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.359
No, no, no, fine.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.395
Give me the form.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.305
Her too.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.307
Simone?

31:26.217 --> 31:29.152
Thank you, Morgan.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.154
You did the right thing.

31:36.294 --> 31:37.394
I'm such a coward.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.328
What?

31:38.330 --> 31:39.596
Why?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.031
I signed us up for
a super-clean shift.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.032
Darren pressured me.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.034
And you volunteered me too?

31:44.036 --> 31:45.202
Well, I had to.

31:45.204 --> 31:48.005
You can't let
that place own you.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.539
Well, what's the alternative?

31:49.541 --> 31:51.141
Not to shop there.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.610
No, that's not an alternative.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.178
Simone.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.414
I need to talk to
you, Simone Ellis.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.348
Grace, we're done.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.249
The co-op's closed.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.918
No, that's fine.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.120
Go ahead.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.555
Call you later.

32:05.557 --> 32:08.091
But I got us tickets to
"juice my cold-pressed body."

32:08.093 --> 32:09.159
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

32:38.489 --> 32:39.489
Sorry.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.691
What happened?

34:06.778 --> 34:10.246
Everything Ok?
- Yeah, why?

34:13.518 --> 34:15.685
You seemed a little
out of it tonight.

34:15.687 --> 34:16.687
Oh.

34:25.362 --> 34:26.362
What was burning?

34:28.733 --> 34:30.233
I think you should
move in with me.

34:33.670 --> 34:34.670
Oh.

34:41.446 --> 34:43.813
Coming?

34:51.289 --> 34:53.824
You don't think it's too soon?

34:53.826 --> 34:55.492
I don't think in those terms.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.362
What terms?

34:59.364 --> 35:00.530
Just terms.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.637
It's just everything's
so good now.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.879
I don't want to force anything.

35:17.849 --> 35:18.849
Simone?

35:24.489 --> 35:25.489
You know me, don't you?

35:28.326 --> 35:30.660
I think so.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.795
You do.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.095
And I know you.

35:33.097 --> 35:35.465
So don't complicate it with
all the things you don't know.

36:00.191 --> 36:03.493
Ok, let's do it.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.427
Really?

36:04.429 --> 36:05.429
Yeah.

36:27.485 --> 36:30.520
See you later.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.756
I'm really happy.

36:32.758 --> 36:33.758
Me too.

36:47.638 --> 36:51.675
Morgan, Morgan.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.677
Jean?

36:54.779 --> 36:55.712
Did you follow us?

36:55.714 --> 36:56.646
Are you Ok?

36:56.648 --> 36:58.582
I'm fine.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.951
Sorry, I haven't answered
your calls or texts.

37:00.953 --> 37:01.885
I just...

37:01.887 --> 37:04.821
No, I mean about grace.

37:04.823 --> 37:05.889
What about grace?

37:10.394 --> 37:11.795
Another accident?

37:11.797 --> 37:15.332
Jesus, that fucking farm.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.700
You saw her that day, right?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.335
That was your shift.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.769
Your memory is disturbing.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.271
Well, we share calendars.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.239
Oh, shit.

37:22.241 --> 37:23.573
We should fix that.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.841
Can I ask you something?

37:24.843 --> 37:25.641
Sure.

37:25.643 --> 37:27.041
And you have to
promise me not to get mad.

37:27.043 --> 37:28.278
I cannot promise you that.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.412
Why?

37:29.414 --> 37:30.680
Because you always make me mad.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.015
Ok, fine.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.450
Promise that you won't
storm out of the room.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.518
Jean, just ask me the question.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.288
Ok.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.724
All right.

37:40.726 --> 37:44.995
Did Simone and grace get along?

37:44.997 --> 37:47.030
No one got along with grace.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.632
I mean, did they argue?

37:48.634 --> 37:50.400
What are you...

37:50.402 --> 37:54.004
When your shift ended, did
you and Simone leave together?

37:54.006 --> 37:55.006
Yes.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.310
But she...

38:00.312 --> 38:01.578
What?

38:01.580 --> 38:03.346
She went back in
to talk to grace.

38:06.517 --> 38:10.854
But she met me later that
night at the art gallery.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.656
Simone Ellis isn't Simone Ellis.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.891
She changed her name
when she was 18.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.559
You made a binder.

38:16.561 --> 38:20.330
Yeah, when I googled her
real name, Allison Walker.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.931
Wait, Allison?

38:21.933 --> 38:24.768
Yeah, why?

38:24.770 --> 38:26.036
Morgan, Walker.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.711
Here, listen.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.487
March 13, 2015.

38:44.489 --> 38:48.858
This is tape 2, Josephine "the
clipper" Walker interview.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.661
Josephine, we started
talking about regret.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.596
Do you regret anything?

38:53.598 --> 38:54.964
Josephine: I regret what

38:54.966 --> 38:57.901
this has done to the
people who've survived it.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.869
The families of the victims?

38:59.871 --> 39:02.472
Their families, my family.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.808
You mean your daughter, ally?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.109
She used to be ally.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.378
I don't know what
happened to her.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.647
When was
the last time you saw her?

39:10.649 --> 39:12.782
She was 15 when I was arrested.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.050
She never came to visit?

39:14.052 --> 39:14.951
Why?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.886
Why would she?

39:16.888 --> 39:20.757
I just hope she's out
there somewhere listening

39:20.759 --> 39:23.026
and that she knows her mother
loves her and always will,

39:23.028 --> 39:24.861
no matter what.

39:24.863 --> 39:28.131
Allison Walker's a common name.

39:28.133 --> 39:31.067
Have you noticed
anything strange about her

39:31.069 --> 39:32.769
besides her personality?

39:32.771 --> 39:33.703
No, not really.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.704
I mean, she's private.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.040
She's not like you.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.508
I'm private.

39:38.510 --> 39:39.776
No, you're not.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.077
You like to talk and
share and pick apart

39:41.079 --> 39:42.946
things until they don't exist.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.548
Simone doesn't need to do that.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.683
I don't need to.

39:46.685 --> 39:47.717
Yes, you do.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.685
That's why we didn't work out.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.453
We shared too much.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.422
There's a lot of things
about me you don't know.

39:52.424 --> 39:52.989
Oh, really?

39:52.991 --> 39:54.758
Like what?

39:54.760 --> 39:56.993
Like my dad once said
that he wished I'd never...

39:56.995 --> 39:57.894
Been born.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.397
I know that.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.531
She's not a murderer.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.832
I'm not saying she is.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.701
I'm just saying I think
you should stay here

40:04.703 --> 40:05.869
until we're sure she isn't.

40:08.773 --> 40:10.607
I'm moving in with her.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.808
Morgan, Jesus.
- What?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.476
It's different this time.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.112
Yeah, like maybe you're
falling for the daughter

40:16.114 --> 40:17.747
of a serial killer, at best.

40:17.749 --> 40:18.982
Oh, well, I'd rather
be with somebody

40:18.984 --> 40:20.183
that scares me to
death than somebody

40:20.185 --> 40:21.818
that bores me to death.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.953
Oh, Ok.

40:23.955 --> 40:24.954
Fine.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.423
Go ahead.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.191
Move in with her and
get married and have

40:28.193 --> 40:31.060
a family that she can stab
in the middle of the night.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.530
That's a really fucked up way
of saying you miss me, Jean.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.732
It's not just that I miss you.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.667
I am worried that your
life is in danger.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.469
I'm not in danger, Ok?

40:39.471 --> 40:40.471
I'm just in love.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.078
Oh, my god.

40:52.049 --> 40:53.550
You're such a girl.

40:53.552 --> 40:54.818
You're such a man.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.085
That's hurtful.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.121
Dude, what's wrong
with you tonight.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.155
You're cagey and shit.

41:06.597 --> 41:07.831
These all Alex's?

41:07.833 --> 41:09.866
Yeah.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.001
I was awful at sports.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.704
What were you good at?

41:14.706 --> 41:16.206
School.

41:16.208 --> 41:17.207
Mm.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.843
I was never good at school.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.612
What were you good at?

41:22.614 --> 41:23.580
Murder.

41:23.582 --> 41:24.481
What?

41:24.483 --> 41:26.082
Shh.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.751
Jean thinks that Simone could
be the daughter of a murdered.

41:28.753 --> 41:29.686
Dude.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.087
I know.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.522
But don't you think Jean's
just being controlling.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.023
I told you that
bitch had secrets.

41:34.025 --> 41:34.991
She doesn't.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.693
She's just mysterious.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.561
You know, mystery is
a high-dollar secret, dude.

41:38.563 --> 41:40.530
Mystery keeps
relationships alive.

41:40.532 --> 41:41.330
Hm.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.933
How would you know what
keeps relationships alive?

41:43.935 --> 41:45.969
Do you want to
see Alex as a baby?

41:45.971 --> 41:46.870
Uh...

41:46.872 --> 41:49.172
She's adorable.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.679
11 pounds.

41:56.681 --> 42:00.583
The doctor said she split
her mother wide open.

42:00.585 --> 42:01.751
Wow.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.086
Alex thinks that's
why her mother

42:03.088 --> 42:05.188
doesn't like her anymore.

42:05.190 --> 42:10.093
This is her first softball team.

42:11.544 --> 42:12.863
That's Brenda Bayhart.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.965
Has she told you
about Brenda Bayhart?

42:15.967 --> 42:17.300
Wine?
- Oh I don't...

42:17.302 --> 42:18.302
I don't drink.

42:21.138 --> 42:25.041
Brenda Bayhart called
Alex a cunt licker.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.644
And so Alex knocked her
two front teeth out.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.078
Mm.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.281
And the teeth had
just come in, so, you know,

42:31.283 --> 42:32.849
permanent damage.

42:32.851 --> 42:36.019
Funny, I'd peg
Alex as a pushover.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.720
Well, she is.

42:37.722 --> 42:40.890
But she's knocked a
lot of teeth out too.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.292
She's from Florida.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.293
Mm.

42:43.295 --> 42:45.728
Lot of serial killers there.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.330
Mm.

42:47.332 --> 42:50.266
You're into all that too, huh?

42:50.268 --> 42:52.735
Jean isn't being controlling.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.971
She's just looking out for you.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.873
And you don't know
anything about that girl.

42:56.875 --> 42:57.941
I know enough.

42:57.943 --> 42:59.609
Why do I have to
know everything?

42:59.611 --> 43:02.078
Can you name one thing
you think is wrong with her?

43:02.080 --> 43:03.613
You mean besides the mom issue?

43:03.615 --> 43:05.315
Yeah, like an imperfection.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.322
Dude, anything.

43:12.324 --> 43:13.222
I'm thinking.

43:13.224 --> 43:14.691
I'll go first.

43:14.693 --> 43:15.925
Kim has dandruff.
- Gross.

43:15.927 --> 43:16.826
I do not need to know that.

43:16.828 --> 43:17.860
Come on.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.228
We're all disgusting people.

43:19.230 --> 43:21.230
Kim's just the least
disgusting person I know.

43:21.232 --> 43:23.232
Simone is not
disgusting at all, Ok?

43:23.234 --> 43:24.701
What about when
she takes a dump?

43:24.703 --> 43:26.102
Shh.
Let's just stop it.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.370
Jesus.

43:27.372 --> 43:30.239
Oh, this is Alex
taking her first...

43:30.241 --> 43:32.875
Why did you quit drinking?

43:32.877 --> 43:38.381
Um, it just got out of hand.

43:38.383 --> 43:40.683
I'd like to see that.

43:40.685 --> 43:42.885
No, you wouldn't.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.053
Why?

43:44.055 --> 43:46.089
Did you hurt someone
or something?

43:49.226 --> 43:50.126
No.

43:50.128 --> 43:51.628
No, I didn't.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.262
You did.

43:53.264 --> 43:54.264
I didn't hurt anyone.

43:59.937 --> 44:02.238
I killed them.

44:08.713 --> 44:09.779
What?

44:09.781 --> 44:13.049
I'm teasing you.

44:13.051 --> 44:16.986
I quit drinking because I got
tired of waking up in my vomit.

44:20.357 --> 44:22.792
I think you and
Jean are being paranoid.

44:22.794 --> 44:25.928
But if that pretty bitch
does anything to hurt you,

44:25.930 --> 44:29.666
I'm more than happy to
unleash my inner Wuornos, Ok?

44:29.668 --> 44:30.833
Ok.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.935
But can you stop
calling her a bitch?

44:32.937 --> 44:33.937
Who?

44:36.707 --> 44:40.743
Simone, I did stand up for you.

44:40.745 --> 44:41.745
I'm tired.

44:49.753 --> 44:50.753
Simone.

45:32.963 --> 45:33.963
Simone?

45:49.880 --> 45:50.880
Simone?

46:07.998 --> 46:09.638
You don't want to do
that in the bathroom?

46:11.068 --> 46:13.136
This is where I do it.

46:15.072 --> 46:23.072
But your clippings
are all over the bed.

46:23.848 --> 46:24.848
Oh.

46:26.383 --> 46:27.450
Oh.

46:32.523 --> 46:33.523
You don't have to do that now.

46:33.525 --> 46:34.457
No, you're right.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.893
So disgusting.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.227
Hey, you Ok?

46:49.173 --> 46:50.173
What are you doing?

46:50.175 --> 46:51.541
That smarts.

46:51.543 --> 46:53.409
Simone, stop.

46:53.411 --> 46:55.011
Simone, stop.

46:55.013 --> 46:56.013
Stop it.

47:00.250 --> 47:01.384
What am I doing wrong?

47:27.945 --> 47:28.978
Morgan, Jesus.

47:28.980 --> 47:31.314
Didn't you get my texts?

47:31.316 --> 47:35.251
Yeah, I mean, I was...

47:35.253 --> 47:37.286
The night that
grace was murdered,

47:37.288 --> 47:40.990
Simone set off the fire alarm
because she was burning this.

47:40.992 --> 47:43.492
It's what left of
a passport photo,

47:43.494 --> 47:46.095
like from an old co-op file
before we used web cams.

47:46.097 --> 47:47.263
So wait.

47:47.265 --> 47:48.965
Now, you think
Simone killed grace.

47:48.967 --> 47:52.435
I think that grace found
out that Simone was Allison.

47:52.437 --> 47:54.270
And then Simone got rid of her.

47:54.272 --> 47:56.205
And I think if she killed
one person, who's to say

47:56.207 --> 47:57.473
she hasn't killed six more.

47:57.475 --> 47:59.508
You think Simone
is "the clipper?"

47:59.510 --> 48:01.143
I think it's possible.

48:01.145 --> 48:02.511
But Josephine confessed.

48:02.513 --> 48:05.014
They never found
a murder weapon.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.949
Maybe Josephine's just
protecting her daughter.

48:06.951 --> 48:08.384
Moms do that.

48:08.386 --> 48:10.219
I mean, mine didn't, but...

48:10.221 --> 48:12.588
Why are you suddenly so
convinced about all this?

48:12.590 --> 48:14.023
Why are you suddenly not?

48:14.025 --> 48:15.524
I thought she was
the love of your life.

48:15.526 --> 48:18.194
She is.

48:18.196 --> 48:21.163
I mean, I don't know.

48:21.165 --> 48:25.468
I've been noticing
things about her lately.

48:25.470 --> 48:27.103
Tonight I saw a
different side of her

48:27.105 --> 48:30.439
and I've been feeling
sick ever since.

48:30.441 --> 48:33.109
Was it a vulnerable side?

48:33.111 --> 48:34.609
What do you mean?

48:34.611 --> 48:37.179
You get sick to your
stomach when people are needy.

48:37.181 --> 48:39.615
I also get sick to my stomach
when I fear for my life.

48:39.617 --> 48:43.019
Morgan, Simone
didn't kill grace.

48:43.021 --> 48:44.021
Jean.

48:44.656 --> 48:46.956
I called Matt.

48:46.958 --> 48:48.491
Crime blogger Matt?

48:48.493 --> 48:50.126
There was a suicide note posted

48:50.128 --> 48:52.628
to the childcare bulletin board.

48:52.630 --> 48:55.064
Simone could have written that.

48:55.066 --> 48:56.699
Grace had a history
of depression.

48:56.701 --> 48:58.167
It wasn't the first
time she tried.

49:09.446 --> 49:11.213
So you don't think
she's a murderer.

49:15.118 --> 49:16.152
I don't know.

49:16.154 --> 49:22.024
I mean, probably not.

49:22.026 --> 49:23.426
Why would you put
me through this?

49:23.428 --> 49:26.529
It wasn't on purpose.

49:26.531 --> 49:27.663
It was just...

49:27.665 --> 49:29.065
I was afraid.

49:29.067 --> 49:30.967
Afraid of what?

49:30.969 --> 49:31.969
Of losing...

49:32.670 --> 49:35.204
Shit.

49:35.206 --> 49:36.472
So, so... I'm so sorry.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.341
I just... I had to flush.

49:38.343 --> 49:39.375
What were you doing?

49:39.377 --> 49:41.410
What is he doing in my bathroom?

49:41.412 --> 49:43.212
Oh, hi.
I'm Jackson.

49:46.083 --> 49:47.450
Morgan.

49:47.452 --> 49:49.185
Oh.

49:49.187 --> 49:50.453
Oh, that's...

49:50.455 --> 49:51.354
Mhm.

49:51.356 --> 49:53.289
Yeah.

49:53.291 --> 49:54.423
Ok.

49:54.425 --> 49:57.460
Hey, do you... do
you guys want tea?

49:57.462 --> 49:58.561
I can make us tea.

49:58.563 --> 50:00.997
I'll make us tea.

50:00.999 --> 50:02.732
It's my tea kettle

50:02.734 --> 50:04.266
no shit?

50:04.268 --> 50:07.269
Well, you know, it's a
really nice tea kettle.

50:07.271 --> 50:08.204
No, I just...

50:08.206 --> 50:09.372
I mean it's mine.

50:09.374 --> 50:11.073
Yeah, Jackson, that'd be great.

50:11.075 --> 50:13.009
Tea would be... be nice.

50:13.011 --> 50:14.011
Ok.

50:19.583 --> 50:20.683
You know what?

50:20.685 --> 50:22.451
This was a bad idea.
- Morgan.

50:22.453 --> 50:23.719
I shouldn't have even come here.

50:23.721 --> 50:25.154
- No, don't.
- Nice to meet you, Jackson.

50:25.156 --> 50:26.156
Don't.

50:32.129 --> 50:34.530
So no tea?

51:30.520 --> 51:31.520
Oh.

51:34.858 --> 51:36.525
Hi.

51:36.527 --> 51:37.527
Hey.

51:41.832 --> 51:45.434
Where did you go?

51:45.436 --> 51:47.803
Just for a walk.

51:56.813 --> 51:59.882
You didn't go to Jean's?

51:59.884 --> 52:01.884
No.

52:01.886 --> 52:02.886
Why?

52:40.524 --> 52:41.524
Shit.

53:00.810 --> 53:03.412
Let's go, ladies.

53:03.414 --> 53:05.814
Round of shots.

53:05.816 --> 53:09.485
I'm getting married.

53:09.487 --> 53:10.487
Woo!

53:20.798 --> 53:27.369
Alex, Alex,
Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex.

53:29.873 --> 53:30.873
Woo!

53:42.452 --> 53:43.452
Woo!

54:58.995 --> 55:00.863
Oh, wow.

55:00.865 --> 55:03.699
Oh, it's so much
softer than mine.

55:03.701 --> 55:05.334
The good thing about
the flash Gordon series

55:05.336 --> 55:07.469
is that if you wear
eyeglasses, they don't get

55:07.471 --> 55:09.071
foggy during heavy breathing.

55:09.073 --> 55:11.440
Oh, Alex doesn't
wear eye glasses,

55:11.442 --> 55:13.942
but that's really good to know.

55:13.944 --> 55:14.910
Oh, wow.

55:14.912 --> 55:16.011
Thank you guys so much.

55:16.013 --> 55:18.981
This is really sweet.

55:18.983 --> 55:20.549
Oh, Simone has a gift.

55:22.952 --> 55:23.952
Ooh.

55:29.092 --> 55:31.493
Oh.

55:31.495 --> 55:33.962
The email specifically
said nothing realistic.

55:33.964 --> 55:35.464
I wasn't on the email.

55:35.466 --> 55:36.699
If you had to bring
something penetrative,

55:36.701 --> 55:38.100
it was supposed to
be a neon color.

55:38.102 --> 55:41.036
I mean, realism implies
that lesbian sex

55:41.038 --> 55:44.840
isn't real sex unless
there's a penis involved.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.575
Sparkling cider on the patio?

55:46.577 --> 55:47.577
Yay.

55:51.014 --> 55:53.449
Let's bring the music.

55:56.686 --> 55:59.755
They're all in aa, so they have

55:59.757 --> 56:02.057
to make rules for everything.

56:02.059 --> 56:03.059
Drink?

56:16.072 --> 56:16.972
Great.

56:16.974 --> 56:18.574
Ok.

56:18.576 --> 56:19.708
There you go.

56:19.710 --> 56:20.676
Wait, wait.

56:20.678 --> 56:22.778
Put your head up.

56:22.780 --> 56:23.780
Ok.

56:45.635 --> 56:46.702
Here, take these.

56:46.704 --> 56:47.704
No.

56:52.909 --> 56:55.811
You going to be Ok?

56:55.813 --> 56:59.415
Everything's about to change.

56:59.417 --> 57:00.816
What do you mean?

57:00.818 --> 57:02.518
Marriage and shit.

57:02.520 --> 57:03.986
No, you guys have
something figured out.

57:03.988 --> 57:05.721
You'll be fine.

57:05.723 --> 57:07.423
I envy you.

57:07.425 --> 57:08.490
Me?

57:08.492 --> 57:09.725
Why?

57:09.727 --> 57:10.727
You have choices.

57:13.029 --> 57:15.898
Well, I wish I didn't have them.

57:15.900 --> 57:17.466
Trash can.

57:17.468 --> 57:18.901
- Trash can.
- Right here.

57:18.903 --> 57:19.903
Here, here.

57:24.808 --> 57:25.808
Phew.

57:28.678 --> 57:32.014
False alarm.

57:32.016 --> 57:33.515
You want me to stay?

57:33.517 --> 57:34.517
Gross.

58:01.044 --> 58:04.613
So how's it going with Morgan?

58:04.615 --> 58:05.514
Good.

58:05.516 --> 58:06.949
Really good.

58:06.951 --> 58:09.051
Yeah?

58:09.053 --> 58:10.819
How's it going with Jackson?

58:10.821 --> 58:12.521
She tells you about Jackson?

58:12.523 --> 58:14.022
Just that he seemed nice.

58:14.024 --> 58:15.891
Mm.

58:15.893 --> 58:18.927
Morgan hates nice.

58:18.929 --> 58:19.828
She does?

58:19.830 --> 58:21.530
Mhm.

58:21.532 --> 58:28.036
And hair in the drain and
eggplant and communicating.

58:28.038 --> 58:29.771
I don't think she
hates communicating.

58:29.773 --> 58:30.906
Well, she calls it sharing.

58:33.810 --> 58:35.290
Well, maybe she
just respects privacy.

58:53.530 --> 58:56.765
I trust her.
It's not that.

58:59.302 --> 59:00.302
What is it then?

59:05.775 --> 59:09.278
I don't know
if I can trust myself.

59:09.280 --> 59:12.247
Why not?

59:12.249 --> 59:14.883
I've never been able to
make a relationship work.

59:18.021 --> 59:21.823
For a while I keep trying,
one after the other, you know?

59:21.825 --> 59:23.559
Oh, yeah.

59:23.561 --> 59:25.894
And I just swore to myself
that I wouldn't do it again,

59:25.896 --> 59:29.264
not until I was really ready.

59:29.266 --> 59:30.266
Ready for what?

59:33.269 --> 59:34.770
You know, to expose myself.

59:38.875 --> 59:42.177
I shouldn't be talking
to you about all this.

59:42.179 --> 59:43.912
I'm glad you are.

59:43.914 --> 59:44.813
Really?

59:44.815 --> 59:45.847
Yeah, sure.

59:49.118 --> 59:51.253
I understand why
Morgan's having such

59:51.255 --> 59:53.956
a hard time letting you go.

59:53.958 --> 59:55.958
Oh.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:10.732
Holy shit.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.457
See you.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.164
Jean.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.298
Over here.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.200
Jean.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.168
Morgan.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.703
What is... what?

01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:50.072
Car, get in the car.

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:51.006
What is going on?

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:51.940
Get down.

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.041
Shh, shh.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.142
Why are you wearing that?

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.848
Oh, it's just from the
bachelor... it does it matter.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:02.317
Look, Simone is "the clipper."

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.919
Morgan, come on.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:04.921
No, look.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.426
What is this?

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:12.428
Open one.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.105
Are those fingernails?

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.807
Jody, Louise, Kate,
Maggie, Theresa.

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.144
Colleen.

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.814
What is that for?

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.282
For just in case.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.317
You know I'm very
against weapons.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:10.252
It's not a weapon.

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:11.787
It's gear.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.530
It's just the cats, I think.

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:22.532
Maybe keep the weapon.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.047
Who are you calling?
- The police.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.948
No.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.183
No way.

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:42.818
Jean, that was four years ago.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.953
There's no expiration
date on PTSD, Morgan.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.522
You were really high
when you got arrested.

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:49.090
Are you saying I'm a liar?

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:51.059
I'm not...

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:55.230
I'm saying that maybe it
wasn't solitary confinement.

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:58.500
Maybe it was a holding
cell in a jail for an hour.

01:03:58.502 --> 01:03:59.868
I feel hives.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.870
Jean, come on.

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:03.371
We don't have any real proof.

01:04:03.373 --> 01:04:04.573
Fingernails aren't illegal.

01:04:04.575 --> 01:04:06.541
Fingernails from dead people.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:07.475
Is my neck red?

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:09.277
Look at my neck.

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:13.348
Ok, the phone's going down.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.918
The phone is going down.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.287
The phone is down.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.871
I'm sorry.

01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:38.473
Sorry.

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:41.576
Simone and I are technically
still... you know?

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:43.011
Oh, yeah.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:47.415
Oh, I mean, Jackson
and I are still...

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.084
Oh, yeah, I know.

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:50.018
Yeah.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.020
Ok.

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:11.239
Hello?

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.241
Who's there?

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:15.911
Simone?

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:16.611
It's Kim.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.580
Is Alex there?

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.448
No, I dropped her off
at your place last night.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.384
Well, she
wasn't home when I got there.

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:26.221
And she never came back.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.175
Um, Kim, we have to
tell you something.

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:48.109
Ok.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.412
Try to stay calm.

01:05:50.414 --> 01:05:52.547
God, what?

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:53.549
Wait, don't tell me.

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.430
Ok, tell me.

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:09.698
We think...

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.000
She's having another
affair, isn't she?

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:12.734
Huh?

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:14.602
I knew it.

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:17.105
She was being so nice to me.

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:18.373
No, that's... that's not...

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:19.274
Wait.

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:20.542
Alex had an affair?

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:22.110
Of course.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:24.412
Who doesn't have affairs?

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:25.647
But she's in love with you.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:27.615
Don't be dumb, Morgan.

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:29.651
That's not all there is.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:32.687
Do you think she's
having an affair now?

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:35.023
I don't know.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:37.125
Because there's a...

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:40.628
There's a chance it
could be something else.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.731
Simone could have
something to do with it.

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:43.765
Simone, why?

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:51.206
Because I broke into her
wooden trunk last night

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:56.511
and I stole some fingernails and
because Alex called her a bitch

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:57.513
the other night.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:05.687
But it could just,
you know, be a kidnapping.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:06.689
Or murder.

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:14.696
You're both insane.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.664
Mhm.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:21.236
I expect this from
Morgan, but not from you.

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:23.071
Hey, why do you
expect it from me?

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.672
Well, you haven't
exactly cared about very much

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.041
other than yourself lately.

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:27.042
What do you mean?

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:28.343
I took Alex home last night.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:30.211
I took her shoes off
in a really sweet way.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:33.748
I can't believe that my
fiance has disappeared.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:37.218
And all you guys care about
are your fucking radio show

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.153
theories.

01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:39.054
Podcast.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.122
Kim, wait.

01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:43.058
Shit.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.125
We have to find Alex.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.301
There she is.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:00.375
She's calling.

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:02.110
You should get a case for that.

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:51.426
Oh, man.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:52.861
Leopoldi's hardware.

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:54.629
Your one-stop shop.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.131
For anybody looking to get
that dead body off their hands.

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:59.600
Oh, my god.

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:00.702
What if we're too late?

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:01.769
What if Alex is already dead?

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.304
Ok, Morgan, you know what?

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.272
Calm down.

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:06.808
We're going to find Alex.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.245
I should have stayed with her.

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:11.212
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:11.912
Oh, my god.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:12.881
Ok, Ok, all right.

01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:14.415
Ok, you know what?

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:15.550
- Did she see us?
- Switch with me.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.684
I'm going to drive.
- No, I'm fine.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:17.919
I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:18.786
Hurry.
- Come on.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:19.888
Come on.
Let's do it.

01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:26.794
Ow, oh.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:27.929
God.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.596
Ok.

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:32.200
Do you think she saw us?

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:34.569
I don't know.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:35.636
Shit.

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:36.571
All right?

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:37.471
Yeah.

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:38.939
You buckled in?

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:40.608
Just get right in here.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.943
You got it.
You got it.

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:42.944
You got it.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:54.522
You're too close.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.291
Well, I can't let
another car get...

01:09:56.293 --> 01:09:57.592
But she's going to see us.

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:59.227
Oh, god.

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:00.528
Can't they save the fucking
planet in the bike path?

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.297
You have to be
aggressive with them.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:03.598
Aggressive, like run them over?

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.366
No, you just have to
scare them a little.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.370
Don't take the wheel like that.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:10.838
I was just trying to...

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.507
Well, that has
always been a problem with us.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:14.542
You can't let me take control.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.843
I always let you take control.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:18.780
Not always, nope.

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:21.316
Not with driving and not with...

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:24.786
I didn't know you wanted
to take control with that.

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:25.753
Of course I did.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:26.988
But you just laid there.

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.989
Well, I was nervous

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:29.657
me too.
- Really?

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:30.692
Because you always seem so...

01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:31.859
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.629
Holy hell.
I'm sorry.

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:35.897
- Just go.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:36.664
Just go.
Just go.

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:37.932
Just go.

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:38.566
What are you doing?

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.235
Jesus.

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:40.835
She's turning.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:41.935
I know.

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:43.571
I'm not blind, Morgan.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:44.973
Wait.

01:10:44.975 --> 01:10:46.474
That's Alex.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:47.475
Wait, wait, wait.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:48.743
Are we going follow Simone?

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.613
Morgan, that's Alex,
your best friend.

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:52.814
She's not dead.

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:53.781
- Right.
- I know.

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:54.682
Of course.

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:55.617
No, you're right.

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:56.818
I know.

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.420
Alex.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.788
Alex.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.393
What is this?

01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:07.395
A fug party?

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:08.630
Where did you go after I left?

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:09.664
Kim is really upset.

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.264
Have you talked to her?

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:13.668
I'm going to see
her in two minutes.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:16.738
Did she make you guys
come look for me?

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:17.939
Not exactly.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.308
We thought Simone
had gotten to you.

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:21.309
Oh, Jesus.

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:22.877
The murder thing?

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:26.447
You guys are fucking
perfect for each other.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:27.382
Are you back together yet?

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.983
No.

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.718
Well, you don't have to say it
like I dislocated your finger.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.520
Well, you don't want to
get back together, do you?

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:33.521
God, no.

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:34.656
You know what?

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:35.890
It really wouldn't
even be cheating

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:37.659
if you guys get sexy again.

01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:38.660
Maybe not to you.

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:39.794
Yeah, what the fuck, Alex?

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.062
What?

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:43.031
Yeah, Kim told
us you cheat on her.

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:44.465
Pfft.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.501
I wasn't cheating on her.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.536
I just... I disappear sometimes.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:49.437
Why?

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:50.471
To be alone.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.439
Really?

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.540
You can't tell Kim.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.008
She wouldn't understand.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.843
It's better for her to
think you're cheating on her?

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:57.545
Yeah, or she'll just think I

01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:58.713
didn't want to be
around her, which

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:00.048
is kind of true sometimes.

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:01.716
Why don't you just talk to her.

01:12:01.718 --> 01:12:03.484
- Morgan?
- What?

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:05.420
You would rather think that
your girlfriend is a murderer

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:07.021
than have an actual
conversation.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:08.423
You think she's a murderer too.

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:09.757
Well, because you
talked me into it.

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.626
You talked me into it first.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:12.927
I was...

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.562
See, Jean, you always do this.

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:15.963
You talk me into something.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:18.099
And then once I'm into
it, you talk me out of it.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:19.033
You know what?

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:21.035
I'm over it.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:22.603
Thanks for the ride.

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:23.938
You're over it?

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.474
Yeah, Jean, I'm over it.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:28.710
You know what?

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:29.712
I'm over it.

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:37.018
Oh, you're over it
now that I'm over it.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.786
How about neither of us
can be over it because we

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:39.921
were never not over it.

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:42.090
You know what else I am?

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:43.791
Annoying.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.126
Relieved.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:48.563
I'm relieved.
Ok, fine, Jean.

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:50.365
I'm sure I won't show
up dead any time soon.

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.370
You're a dick.

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:59.807
Does nobody care that my
life could be in danger?

01:12:59.809 --> 01:13:01.649
Call me when your head's
out of your ass, dude.

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:30.972
Alex: Hey, it's Alex.

01:13:30.974 --> 01:13:31.974
Leave a message.

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:46.554
Hey, you've reached

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:47.855
Jean and "women who kill, inc."

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:48.857
Leave a message.

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:04.505
You have one new voice message.

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:06.808
Simone: Hey, it's me.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:09.544
I saw what you did.

01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:11.612
You should have
talked to me first.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.919
Excuse me.

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.821
Hi, hello.

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:21.222
Um, behind you.

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:23.524
Hi.
Sorry.

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:24.459
Excuse me.

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:25.793
Is this the...

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.161
Shit.

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:30.531
You dropped it a
few blocks ago, I mean,

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:32.834
not that I have
been following you.

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:34.135
- Thanks for giving it to me.
- Oh, no.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.703
I am the one who
should be thanking

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:40.041
you for what you've given me.

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:43.211
Your show, it got me
through a really hard time.

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:46.881
I... I recently lost a friend,
like a really dear friend.

01:14:46.883 --> 01:14:47.815
I'm sorry.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.951
She was my mentor.

01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:52.653
And we were really connected.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:56.090
She is the one who taught me
how to be honest with myself.

01:14:56.092 --> 01:14:58.659
And Donna would
always say, Celia...

01:14:58.661 --> 01:14:59.827
I'm Celia.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.761
Hi.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:02.864
You're Morgan.

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:06.601
She would say, Celia,
leave me alone.

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:09.670
You're too close.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.072
Well, she sounds really nice.

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:14.075
Yeah, oh, she meant
physically, not emotionally.

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:16.210
I mean, she might have
also meant emotionally.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:17.845
We will never know that.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:21.549
But we always used to listen
to your show together.

01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:22.583
I mean, we weren't together.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:23.951
But it felt like we were.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:27.221
And she loved that azalea
lady, the professor.

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:28.122
Lila.

01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:29.056
Lila.

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:31.225
Yeah, you were close.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.226
You think so?

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:34.529
Oh, there was a connection.

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:39.901
Do you know what time it is?

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:46.007
Oh, that's what she used to say.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:47.642
It is 2:00 pm.

01:15:47.644 --> 01:15:48.843
I have to go.

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:49.844
That's what she would
always say next.

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:51.112
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

01:15:51.114 --> 01:15:52.914
It's just...
No, she just died in...

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:53.881
I'm sorry about your friend.
A really horrible way.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.082
It was a recycling truck.

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:57.151
And we were all
yelling behind the guy.

01:15:57.153 --> 01:16:01.622
We're like, she's
in your wheels, man.

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:02.790
It was so nice to meet you.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:05.192
Thank you.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:09.263
Uh, I'm actually going this
way, anyway, so I'm not weird.

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.672
What's this episode about?

01:16:17.674 --> 01:16:19.073
Oh, it's not for an episode.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:22.777
I just came to talk.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:23.844
You're not going to record it?

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:25.813
Oh, I can if you want me to.

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:27.248
Only if you want to.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.317
I'll do that.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:39.727
Now, tell me
about your lady stuff.

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:41.629
Ok, well, you met Jean, my ex.

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:42.663
Unfortunately.

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.268
She and I work so
well together because we

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:48.970
don't work so well together.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.174
She makes me feel
like the person I am,

01:16:53.176 --> 01:16:56.243
and I don't like that
person very much, so...

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:57.178
And then there's Simone.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.313
Oh, la-la, Simone.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.649
Simone is NOM mysterious.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:03.385
Yeah.

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:08.055
Simone makes me feel
alive and present.

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:14.762
She makes me feel like a
person I want to be, you know?

01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:17.665
What, dear?

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:20.768
I think she might be a murderer.

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:32.780
Maybe this is a bad idea.

01:17:32.782 --> 01:17:34.382
Aren't you having a good time?

01:17:34.384 --> 01:17:35.316
It's not that.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:36.416
It's just...

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.252
You have no idea
how lonely it gets,

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.755
being with women like these.

01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:47.061
All the simplicity
really hurts my feelings.

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:50.064
But you are not simple,
Morgan, are you?

01:17:50.066 --> 01:17:51.999
I'm not.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.701
You're more like me.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:59.940
Mind if I tell you
something private?

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:02.410
I don't mind.

01:18:02.412 --> 01:18:07.181
Before I told you love
was the act of killing.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.417
That's not true.

01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:15.189
It's the moment right before
when they stop struggling.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.391
They succumb.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:21.996
The fear in their
eyes, it shifts.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:29.003
And they fill up
with something I can

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.405
only describe as pure grace.

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:37.178
It was the sweetest
thing I've ever known.

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.982
Maybe it was just
a lack of oxygen.

01:18:41.984 --> 01:18:42.917
Shh, shh.

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:44.051
Shh, shh.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.386
Quit your fighting.

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:48.255
The fact is that you
want to feel it too.

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.491
So here's what you do.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.833
Jean.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:01.335
Holy shit.

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:02.903
Sorry.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:03.838
It's Ok.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.739
It's Ok.

01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:05.873
I was just swiffering.

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:07.274
This late?

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:08.909
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.177
It comforts me.

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:11.078
When I was little,
my mom used to always

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.012
wake up in the middle...

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:13.347
I need to talk to Jean.

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:14.915
Oh, Ok.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.417
Yeah, I don't... I
thought she was with you.

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:17.818
Why?

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.453
Well, she left a while ago.

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:21.088
She... she got worried
when she couldn't

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.490
reach you on your phone.

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:24.792
But then she told me that
she saw on your calendar

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:28.996
that you had a super-clean shift
with Simone so she went there.

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:30.164
To the co-op?

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:32.166
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:34.135
I mean, I made us a nice dinner
and everything, you know?

01:19:34.137 --> 01:19:36.003
And I was hoping to catch
some "democracy now,"

01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:37.805
but then I realized that the

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.292
Simone?

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:16.437
Jean?

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:19.406
Jean.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:20.408
Oh my god.

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.144
Morgan.

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:29.216
She fell.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:30.218
She hit her head.

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.489
We should call an ambulance.

01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:36.991
Yeah, I already did.

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:51.438
Put that down.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.173
You look ridiculous.

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:54.241
Stop.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.510
Stop. Leave her alone.

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:57.592
Don't you want to help her?

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:02.416
Give me that?

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.458
Get back.

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:31.045
What if I told you I
did kill those people?

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:40.554
Would that make you feel
better to have a way out?

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:57.371
She's gone now.

01:22:57.373 --> 01:23:02.509
I know you didn't mean
to hurt me, but you did.

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:17.992
I still love you, Morgan.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:24.465
And I know that you're scared.

01:23:24.467 --> 01:23:27.334
No, I'm not.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.670
We can be happy.

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:32.506
Please, stop.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:36.677
Let's get fat and boring
and argue about nothing.

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:44.685
Let's finish each
other's sentences,

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:46.020
wear each other's clothes.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.358
Let's be vulnerable together.

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:12.279
Morgan?

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:18.118
Jean?

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.120
Stay away.

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:25.392
What did you do?

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.390
Morgan?

01:24:56.392 --> 01:25:00.327
I hurt some people.

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:35.195
It was self-defense.

01:25:35.197 --> 01:25:36.230
Come on.

01:25:36.232 --> 01:25:38.198
Did you even open the case file?

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.666
I, mean I flipped through.

01:25:39.668 --> 01:25:41.468
At the very least, I
know she was threatened.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.370
No, she
claims she was threatened.

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:44.905
But she had injuries.

01:25:44.907 --> 01:25:46.807
Yeah, all
proven to be self-inflicted.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:48.208
Look,
are there parts of her story

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:49.308
that I doubt?

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:51.211
Sure. But you could
say the same thing

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:52.646
for the eyewitness accounts.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.448
Ok, now, I agree with you there.

01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:56.150
Those were all pretty unclear.

01:25:56.152 --> 01:25:58.585
But if you look at the
evidence, which for some reason

01:25:58.587 --> 01:25:59.820
you're refusing to do...

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:01.221
I am not refusing.

01:26:01.223 --> 01:26:02.456
I've just been a little...

01:26:02.458 --> 01:26:03.624
Distracted, I know.

01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:04.491
I'm not claiming

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:05.491
what she did was right.

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:06.691
I'm just saying, I
believe her when she

01:26:06.693 --> 01:26:07.728
says she had no other choice.

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.296
Yeah, and what I'm saying

01:26:09.298 --> 01:26:10.831
is that the facts
back up the victim.

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.900
There was no reason
for self-defense.

01:26:12.902 --> 01:26:14.301
I think we should

01:26:14.303 --> 01:26:15.502
poll the listeners on this one.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.337
Ah, good idea.

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:20.274
Join us next time
to hear the results.

01:26:20.276 --> 01:26:21.441
I'm Morgan.

01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:22.509
And I'm Jean.

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:23.710
And we are...

01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:25.312
"women who kill."
