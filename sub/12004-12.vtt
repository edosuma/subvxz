Previously on
"Switched at birth"...

00:10.210 --> 00:13.113
she doesn't like me.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.349
Here.

00:15.415 --> 00:18.252
- All yours.
- Okay, here we go.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.220
One more time, ladies. Let's go.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.990
Hi, Tina Choi. "Kansas city Herald."

00:23.056 --> 00:24.391
Kathryn, did you read this article?

00:24.458 --> 00:27.361
We sound totally Fine about missing
out on raising our own daughters.

00:27.427 --> 00:31.131
Simone is one of bay's good friends.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.067
Well, used to
be good friend--

00:34.134 --> 00:35.402
or actually I don't know.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.272
- Can I see your hearing aids?
- It doesn't turn off my brain.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.407
Only my ears.

00:40.474 --> 00:44.178
Get in here now!

00:52.085 --> 00:54.388
?T× she don't know
what she wants to be ?T×

00:54.454 --> 00:57.257
?T× all the pictures

00:57.324 --> 00:59.960
?T× holding hands when
she's mad at me ?T×

01:00.027 --> 01:02.396
?T× 'cause she don't want
to go, don't want to go ?T×

01:02.462 --> 01:04.298
- ?T× I met her at... ?T×
- excuse me.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.167
Are you okay?

01:07.234 --> 01:10.137
Oh, just fine. Thanks.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.306
Can we hurry up, please?

01:12.372 --> 01:15.175
?T× Singing "Oh oh" ?T×

01:15.242 --> 01:18.011
?T× won't you help
me sing this song? ?T×

01:18.078 --> 01:20.314
?T× Singing the eee eee ?T×

01:20.380 --> 01:23.050
?T× she don't ever

01:23.116 --> 01:26.386
?T× singing Hey, mama,

01:26.453 --> 01:29.089
?T× just a kiss before I leave ?T×

01:29.156 --> 01:31.925

01:34.294 --> 01:37.231
?T× Hey, mama, hey hey, mama ?T×

01:41.468 --> 01:44.338
?T× uh-oh uh-oh
oh oh... ?T×

01:51.345 --> 01:54.181
I don't think we can use that one.

01:59.219 --> 02:03.223
Because it's staged. We told those guys

02:03.290 --> 02:06.093
to act like we weren't there.

02:07.294 --> 02:11.198
So to really be planking,

02:11.265 --> 02:15.265
you can't stage or photoshop Anything.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.241
What are you looking for?

02:23.377 --> 02:25.946
Aha Ha
ha-- funny.

02:26.013 --> 02:29.383
I'm just saying True art, it needs to be

02:29.449 --> 02:31.051
authentic.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.220
People can sense when
something is phony.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.923
Okay, stop!

02:35.989 --> 02:38.225
Stop that.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.064
Oh, he-- hello.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.265
Hi.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.318 --> 03:07.321
Something without something?

03:10.424 --> 03:14.294
I can't talk...

03:20.434 --> 03:23.203
you know what? Maybe I should go.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.274
Okay, Bye.

03:30.275 --> 03:40.275
<i>Sync By Hale</i>

03:53.266 --> 03:56.236
Oh, heels and an apron--
how "Mad men" of you, mom.

03:56.303 --> 04:00.374
- I have a meeting today.
- Yowza, nice outfit.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.277
You should bring this
next time we go somewhere.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.444
- Ew.
- Ew.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.147
Who are you meeting?

04:08.181 --> 04:09.483
Oh, Tina Choi.

04:09.549 --> 04:12.252
The reporter from the
"Kansas city Herald."

04:12.319 --> 04:14.288
- Oh Yeah.
- Yeah, she called your mother.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.255
She wants to check in
and see how we're doing.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.027
I told Wilke I'd meet him
early. So I'm gonna head out.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.196
All right, well, I'm gonna let her know

04:23.263 --> 04:27.434
how we felt about her
she doesn't do it again.Re

04:30.337 --> 04:32.239
it might be without the apron.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.308
Or just add a wooden spoon Maybe.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.443
Ha ha, very very funny.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.479
Yeah, they get that from me.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.755
What's up with the fancy breakfast?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.591
What? There has to be a reason?

04:51.658 --> 04:53.893
Uh, Yeah.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.430
Well, we haven't had much time to talk

04:57.497 --> 05:00.800
since you went to that music festival.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.636
There wasn't much to talk about.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.539
What about bay and Emmett?

05:06.606 --> 05:08.842
What about them?

05:08.908 --> 05:12.512
They're dating. You didn't tell me.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.681
I didn't think it was important.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.683
It's not like Emmett and I are dating.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.419
No,
but--

05:19.486 --> 05:21.554
you two spent a lot of time together.

05:21.621 --> 05:25.458
Emmett and I will still see each other.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.627
We have like four classes together.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.630
I just... I wish that you two

05:30.697 --> 05:33.733
hadn't been so exclusive, that's all.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.903
It seems like you're
of time by yourself,t

05:36.970 --> 05:38.838
now that he and bay are together.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.907
I'm fine, Mom.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.614
Okay.

05:49.749 --> 05:53.753
What the hell is a "capibra" And why
do we need to spend $400 to buy one?

05:53.820 --> 05:55.822
Capybara.  It's a 200lb rodent.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.825
And we aren't buying, we're
renting-- you need permits to buy one.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.628
I don't want to rent or buy a capybara.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.798
I want to make a video that showcases
our music, not a giant rodent.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.667
And it will! But you've gotta have
a hook to get them to look at you,

06:07.734 --> 06:10.437
then you deliver the goods. Bam!

06:10.503 --> 06:12.639
Okay, I get it-- we need to
make a flashy music video.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.642
But how are we gonna pay for it? Our
parents aren't going to give us the money.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.544
I know. How unfair is that?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.612
You run up a few gambling
debts, steal one test,

06:19.679 --> 06:21.715
and suddenly they treat
you like a criminal.

06:21.781 --> 06:24.551
I do know one way we
can make some money.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.786
How do I just know This is gonna suck?

06:51.611 --> 06:54.447
I wasn't expecting

06:54.514 --> 06:55.949
to see you until later.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.854
I'll see you at
school. And you too--

07:00.920 --> 07:02.922
I have cooking class today.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.707
Yeah, what was that about?

07:20.774 --> 07:24.577
I can't follow you when
you're talking with her.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.850
You did?

07:30.917 --> 07:33.553
That's great!

07:33.620 --> 07:35.522
But Why was she mad?

07:35.588 --> 07:37.757
I mean, she talks, Daphne talks.

07:40.493 --> 07:43.596
She must have a reason for
not wanting you to take it.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.935
She thinks that I made you?

07:51.504 --> 07:53.540
And if I did ask you to?

07:56.743 --> 07:57.777
But I do.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.848
Emmett, she is not just your mom.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.651
She's my mom's best friend.

08:04.718 --> 08:08.555
She coaches Daphne's team with my Dad.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.623
I can't have her hate me.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.595
Oh, she does. She hates me.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.934
Emmett,
I--

08:33.313 --> 08:35.282
?T× If I didn't know you ?T×

08:35.347 --> 08:37.450
?T× I'd turn a blind eye... ?T×

08:37.517 --> 08:39.486
the Ref didn't even believe she hit me

08:39.553 --> 08:41.520
until the doctor looked
at my elbow after the game.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.390
- No foul?
- Nope.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.492
But we got our revenge.
Scored 12 more points

08:45.559 --> 08:47.661
- on of her by the end of the quarter.
- Oh, that's awesome!

08:47.727 --> 08:51.665
I mean, I'm sorry you got hurt, but
it must be so fun to play that hard.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.600
Oh Yeah.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.705
- Do you know Simone?
- Uh, yeah, since like kindergarten.

08:58.772 --> 09:02.476
How's that Mr. Waffles? Cutest dog Ever.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.311
He died last summer.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.513
Oh.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.516
You guys are in cooking class Together.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.686
Yeah, Daphne pulled my
Bacon out of the fire today.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.522
Always looking to save that pig.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.427
She's a
vegetarian, so she--

09:20.494 --> 09:22.329
you know what? It's cool. Forget it.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.297
Hey, thanks for sticking
me with the cleanup.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.566
Oh, but it's so much fun watching you

09:26.633 --> 09:29.369
- try to figure out how soap works.
- Aha.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.239
First Bell. Later.

09:32.305 --> 09:36.243
Hey, we should play
hoops together sometime.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.246
There's actually a pick-up
game this afternoon.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.348
You should totally come by.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.550
We want to start right at the beginning.

09:43.617 --> 09:47.617
Before you even had the babies-- the hopes
you and John Had for your little golden girl,

09:48.388 --> 09:50.357
the trepidation Regina must have had,

09:50.423 --> 09:51.658
being a single mother

09:51.725 --> 09:54.261
with An unreliable boyfriend
and a drinking problem.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.695
Wait. H-How do you know all of this?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.698
I'm a reporter.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.669
and-- and how could you
possibly get all that happened

10:02.736 --> 10:05.238
into one follow-up article?

10:05.305 --> 10:06.606
- Article?
- Yeah.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.242
No, we're talking about a book.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.578
We've never had as much
response to an article

10:11.645 --> 10:13.580
as we have to that piece
I did on your family.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.283
We're still getting emails
from people wanting to know

10:16.349 --> 10:18.351
how you are, how it really happened.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.387
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's a natural.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.491
People love this kind of True-life-horror-
story- with-a-happy-ending.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.493
Like that little girl that was kidnapped

10:26.560 --> 10:28.662
and held captive for 18
years and found alive.

10:28.728 --> 10:32.728
Okay, we are not a horror story and have
no intention of being turned into one.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.304
Kathryn, however you characterize
it, it is a great story,

10:37.370 --> 10:39.706
someone is going to tell
it-- authorized or not.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.276
Not that I would tell it
unauthorized, of course.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.645
- Of course not.
- You don't want to wait on this.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.712
You want to get out in front of
it-- and with someone you trust.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.352
Someone who shares
your midwestern values.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.387
Like you?

10:55.388 --> 10:57.290
Absolutely.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.427
Okay, the cars roll
out, you wipe them down,

11:00.494 --> 11:03.663
you make sure the tires are clean, then
you flap your towel for the customer.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.665
Don't leave rags on the car.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.734
And you will be wearing these.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.405
No offense, Mr. Kennish,

11:12.472 --> 11:15.242
but we don't wanna holster the guns.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.677
That's how we're gonna get the big tips.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.280
Heh! Good luck with that.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.515
All right.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.219
?T× I got it under control ?T×

11:26.286 --> 11:27.621
?T× control control control ?T×

11:30.590 --> 11:33.426
?T× I got it under control... ?T×

11:40.767 --> 11:43.403
- check it.
- So what's the sign for "You're going down"?

11:43.470 --> 11:46.306
- you're about to find out.
- Tied game, last basket wins.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.708
?T× They can't figure me out ?T×

11:48.775 --> 11:51.411
- ?T× and while I run away... ?T×
- shoot it.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.648
?T× I got it under control. ?T×

11:54.714 --> 11:56.249
Nice.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.451
- Hey, Sorry about that.
- I'm not!

11:58.518 --> 12:00.554
Way to let out let
those killer Instincts.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.657
Hey, I was thinking about Hitting
up crossroads for first fridays.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.227
There's supposed to be this amazing
Thai food truck. You interested?

12:07.294 --> 12:09.429
I would love to, but I'm
actually going to Joey's

12:09.496 --> 12:11.431
- with some of these guys.
- Oh.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.233
That's okay. Next time.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.702
No, this time. You should come with us.

12:15.769 --> 12:20.240
- Who's Joey?
- No no, Joey's is this club near U.M.K.C.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.342
Lots of cute college guys.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.478
It's over-21 though. You need a fake.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.446
That's not a problem.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.548
Cool, I'll text you the info then.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.684
Sweet.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.654
Hey, coach.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.290
I'm coach Medlock. Do you have a second?

12:42.696 --> 12:45.298
Oh--
uh, ahhh.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.267
I-- I didn't
see you.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.368
There.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.471
Oh, uh, Yeah.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.273
Uh...

12:53.340 --> 12:54.574
sometimes
I like to--

12:54.641 --> 12:57.244
to see how the colors are

12:57.310 --> 12:59.479
working in the natural

12:59.546 --> 13:01.414
light. You know what? Never mind.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.482
It's not important.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.418
Are-- are you
here to see Regina?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.626
Uh--
Oh, wait.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.665
I just-- I
want you to know

13:18.732 --> 13:22.269
that speech therapy

13:22.335 --> 13:24.638
was Emmett's idea.

13:24.704 --> 13:28.375
I didn't ask him to take it.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.579
You didn't have to.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.356
- Hey.
- Hey Hey, sweetie, perfect timing!

13:43.423 --> 13:46.326
Listen, I'm thinking about
changing the starting line up.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.528
I'm thinking about
moving Jennifer to forward

13:48.595 --> 13:50.497
and pulling Emily back for defense.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.600
I think-- - uh, coach Medlock
wants me to play for Buckner.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.405
Of course he does. He has
an excellent eye for talent.

13:58.472 --> 14:01.641
Yeah, he saw me playing a
pick-up game at Buckner today,

14:01.708 --> 14:03.577
and he knows that I play for Carlton,

14:03.643 --> 14:06.580
and so he asked me to join the team!

14:06.646 --> 14:08.515
Except you're already on another team.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.651
This is Buckner. They're
like a million times Better.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.620
Sweetie,

14:13.687 --> 14:16.623
I know this is incredibly flattering

14:16.690 --> 14:19.226
and we can revisit this
at the end of the year.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.461
Or even at the end of the season.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.731
But you don't quit your team.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.568
- Okay?
- Right.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.303
Right, okay.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.773
So what do you think
of Jennifer at forward?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.410
- That's good, right?
- Yeah Sure.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.279
We put her at the three position

14:39.346 --> 14:42.449
and Emily is gonna be much more
helpful with you on defense.

14:42.516 --> 14:45.685
When you guys are pressing, we have
someone there who can actually move.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.355
right?

15:01.502 --> 15:03.771
Okay, wait, you,
me, your mom-- wait.

15:03.838 --> 15:04.972
What--
okay.

15:10.745 --> 15:12.747
what? No!

15:14.582 --> 15:15.716
No! No no no no no!

15:15.783 --> 15:17.752
We will avoid her.

15:22.490 --> 15:23.691
Yes. No!

15:23.758 --> 15:26.594
Oh Oh, that looks weird.

15:26.660 --> 15:30.431
- Now I have to go.
- Hey, um,

15:30.498 --> 15:33.467
I just wanted to say that you guys

15:33.534 --> 15:35.670
make a really cute Couple.

15:37.872 --> 15:39.473
Uh, Regina?

15:39.540 --> 15:41.475
Yeah?

15:41.542 --> 15:43.944
What are you doing tomorrow night?

15:46.747 --> 15:48.716
Wilke!

15:48.783 --> 15:52.486
- Hey.
- You're here and there's no cooking class today.

15:52.553 --> 15:53.854
I knew you were stalking me!

15:53.921 --> 15:56.691
Well, I actually had a question for you.

15:56.757 --> 15:58.659
I figured it would be
best to ask in Person.

15:58.726 --> 16:00.728
Oh, good cover.

16:00.795 --> 16:02.863
I... I need a fake I.D.

16:02.930 --> 16:06.567
The guy I knew at Carlton that
did 'em graduated last year.

16:06.634 --> 16:08.636
So I thought you might know Somebody.

16:08.703 --> 16:10.838
That could cost you a few bucks.

16:10.905 --> 16:13.607
That's okay. It's important.

16:13.674 --> 16:17.611
And... I'll bet there are a
lot of other kids at Carlton

16:17.678 --> 16:19.947
Who also might be in the
market for a fake I.D.

16:21.749 --> 16:23.851
Yeah,
probably. So--

16:23.918 --> 16:25.686
do you know
somebody or--?

16:25.753 --> 16:27.888
Actually, I do.

16:27.955 --> 16:31.459
As it happens, I am the
guy you're looking for.

16:31.525 --> 16:34.562
- Really? That's great.
- Now why don't you and I go have some coffee,

16:34.628 --> 16:35.896
discuss the particulars of your I.D.

16:35.963 --> 16:38.466
And how we might market my
services to your classmates

16:38.532 --> 16:40.601
I actually got to get back to Carlton.

16:40.668 --> 16:43.537
We've got a game today. But
text me, okay? Thank you.

16:44.739 --> 16:47.775
- Huh.
- Hey, what was Daphne doing here?

16:47.842 --> 16:50.611
Helping us buy a capybara.

18:06.587 --> 18:09.590
This is a whole video tutorial on
how to make fake identity Cards.

18:09.657 --> 18:11.726
Hey, do you mind? I
still can't find mine.

18:11.792 --> 18:15.696
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Looks like the hot tip is to make it from another State.

18:15.763 --> 18:17.798
What are you guys doing?

18:17.865 --> 18:19.867
Starting our own small
Business. Fake I.D.S.

18:19.934 --> 18:22.436
Want to get back in the pool?
Give you the family rate.

18:22.503 --> 18:23.904
- You're kidding, right?
- What?

18:23.971 --> 18:25.840
You get caught now no
one can have a fake I.D.?

18:25.906 --> 18:29.543
uh, having one and selling them
are two totally different things.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.779
I get caught, I get community service.

18:31.846 --> 18:34.715
You get caught, you get a cell
and a roommate at leavenworth.

18:34.782 --> 18:36.884
She does have a point.

18:36.951 --> 18:38.753
Maybe this isn't the best idea.

18:38.819 --> 18:40.721
It's on the internet,
dude. It's just--

18:40.788 --> 18:43.591
"a unique party favor to
share with all your friends."

18:45.593 --> 18:47.461
What people do with
them after they get them,

18:47.528 --> 18:48.829
we have no control over that.

18:48.896 --> 18:50.798
Wow, way to rationalize.

18:50.865 --> 18:52.800
I thought you were
turning over a new leaf

18:52.867 --> 18:54.969
after the whole
stealing-the-test thing.

18:57.605 --> 18:59.807
Okay, fine. Let's just ask your Dad

18:59.874 --> 19:01.842
for a couple extra
shifts at the car wash.

19:01.909 --> 19:03.844
At three bucks a car plus minimum wage,

19:03.911 --> 19:05.680
we should be able to fund our video

19:05.746 --> 19:08.549
about the time "Guitar face"
Is ready for a reunion tour.

19:08.616 --> 19:11.719
- Yeah, we should get some more card stock.
-   And ink Cartridges.

19:11.786 --> 19:12.953
Mm-hmm, Definitely.

19:18.826 --> 19:20.528
Hey,
mom--

19:20.594 --> 19:22.763
what is with the books?

19:22.830 --> 19:24.932
Oh, it's just a little homework.

19:28.502 --> 19:31.472
- What's up?
- I... I need some Advice.

19:31.539 --> 19:33.507
Wait, from me?

19:33.574 --> 19:35.810
Don't look so happy about
it. That just makes it Harder.

19:35.876 --> 19:38.446
Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:38.512 --> 19:41.816
I think Emmett's mom hates me.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.786
Melody? Okay, why would she hate you?

19:47.488 --> 19:49.457
Em-Emmett and
I have kind of--

19:49.523 --> 19:52.460
- We've been hanging out.
- You and Emmett?

19:52.526 --> 19:54.695
I thought it was
he and Daphne-- - No.

19:54.762 --> 19:57.565
- He and I are together.
- Wait, together together?

19:57.631 --> 20:00.634
Are you two--
are you serious?

20:00.701 --> 20:02.570
Yeah, mom,

20:02.636 --> 20:04.905
it's kind of serious.

20:05.906 --> 20:09.477
- Huh.
- Wow, really?!

20:09.543 --> 20:13.681
- it's that hard to believe We're a couple?
-   No no, of course not.

20:13.748 --> 20:16.650
It's just that, well, there was liam

20:16.717 --> 20:18.719
then there's ty and
now there's-- - wow.

20:18.786 --> 20:22.490
You and melody Should get together and
discuss why I am so horrible for Emmett.

20:22.556 --> 20:25.760
She thinks he's flunking out because of me
and you think I'm some sort of boy junkie.

20:25.826 --> 20:27.695
I'm just trying to understand, honey.

20:27.762 --> 20:30.765
He and I have way more in
common than liam and I ever did.

20:30.831 --> 20:33.901
And he's age appropriate which
I thought you would appreciate.

20:33.968 --> 20:37.968
And, mom, he gets me and I get him.

20:38.673 --> 20:42.710
Well, then melody SHOULD
consider herself lucky

20:42.777 --> 20:46.514
that her son is Dating
someone as smart and caring

20:46.580 --> 20:49.417
and creative as you. And if she doesn't,

20:49.483 --> 20:51.552
well then, it's her loss.

20:51.619 --> 20:54.555
Mmm, no, it's my loss because
once the mom disapproves

20:54.622 --> 20:56.724
of the girlfriend, it's
just a matter of time.

20:56.791 --> 21:00.761
Oh wait, we do not have as
much power as you think we do.

21:00.828 --> 21:02.530
- Really?
- Really.

21:02.596 --> 21:05.800
- Was dating Melissa remember When Toby mm
- hmm, do you

21:05.866 --> 21:08.502
- the hippie Chick?
- I never said a word!

21:08.569 --> 21:12.606
You didn't have to! Which is why
I have to get melody to like me.

21:12.673 --> 21:15.776
So Regina and I are going
to go over there and...

21:15.843 --> 21:19.914
the plan is to try and convince
her that I'm not the antichrist.

21:21.716 --> 21:23.551
Except I don't know how to do that.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.486
I don't know how to make her like me.

21:25.553 --> 21:28.756
Honey, just be yourself.

21:28.823 --> 21:31.592
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

21:31.659 --> 21:35.529
People like you. They do not like me.

21:35.596 --> 21:37.631
So I don't want to be
myself tonight. I want--

21:37.698 --> 21:39.433
to be you.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.701
Honey,
you're--

21:43.904 --> 21:46.540
you could lighten up a
little on the sarcasm.

21:46.607 --> 21:49.777
Mm-hmm. - And
bring artichoke dip.

21:49.844 --> 21:52.513
Oh, I love your artichoke dip.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.715
Everybody does. It
sounds like a vegetable

21:54.782 --> 21:56.650
and it's full of Mayo and cheese.

21:56.717 --> 21:59.653
There is no way melody Can resist that.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.656
Thank you.

22:02.723 --> 22:04.892
You'll win her over.

22:04.959 --> 22:07.528
I hope so.

22:15.536 --> 22:16.904
Can I come in?

22:16.971 --> 22:19.707
Yeah sure. I'm just
taking a little break.

22:21.575 --> 22:23.577
So you in business with Wilke?

22:24.945 --> 22:26.881
Yeah, it turns out

22:26.947 --> 22:28.883
he's in sales

22:28.949 --> 22:32.753
and I'm in manufacturing?

22:34.722 --> 22:37.825
He sells. I make.

22:39.660 --> 22:41.762
You know, now that I'm learning to sign,

22:41.829 --> 22:43.864
I am finding that we hearing people

22:43.931 --> 22:46.434
use FAR too many Words.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.603
Well, I just hope you don't
get in trouble on my account.

22:49.670 --> 22:52.606
Ahhh.

22:52.673 --> 22:55.509
Okay.

22:56.877 --> 22:58.913
I need some advice.

23:00.915 --> 23:04.819
I want to quit the Carlton
basketball team and join Buckner's.

23:09.724 --> 23:11.592
Does dad know?

23:11.659 --> 23:13.694
That's the advice I need.

23:13.761 --> 23:17.631
You quit baseball. Okay,
so how did you do it?

23:17.698 --> 23:19.800
I don't know, I just

23:19.867 --> 23:22.503
told him I didn't want to play anymore,

23:22.570 --> 23:24.905
that sports was his thing
and music was my thing.

23:24.972 --> 23:27.775
- And he was okay with that?
- Oh, hell no.

23:27.842 --> 23:30.778
- But y'know, he had bay.
- Bay played baseball?

23:30.845 --> 23:33.681
Soccer. For about 10 minutes

23:33.748 --> 23:37.718
until we all decided that
that was a very bad idea.

23:39.754 --> 23:43.691
But it gave him a place to put all
that coaching-sports connection stuff

23:43.758 --> 23:46.961
- when I quit.
- So what'd he do with it after bay Stopped playing soccer?

23:48.529 --> 23:51.499
I dunno. I guess it
just kind of went away.

23:51.565 --> 23:53.934
Until you showed up.

23:55.736 --> 23:57.471
And you're not a musician,

23:57.538 --> 23:59.440
and you're not an artist...

23:59.507 --> 24:01.642
I'm an athlete, like him.

24:01.709 --> 24:05.513
The mini-me dad never had.
And he loves coaching you.

24:05.579 --> 24:07.682
So you're telling me to stay?

24:07.748 --> 24:09.917
You asked for my advice.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.855
You can still do what you want.

24:14.922 --> 24:17.725
You don't have to listen to John.

24:17.792 --> 24:19.727
But he's my Dad.

24:19.794 --> 24:22.596
He's the whole reason I
can even play basketball.

24:22.663 --> 24:25.466
I mean genetically speaking.

24:25.533 --> 24:28.736
Well, that
doesn't give him veto power

24:28.803 --> 24:32.440
- over where you can play.
- I just want to play for a good team.

24:32.506 --> 24:35.676
I want to win! It's the kennish
in me. I get that from him too.

24:35.743 --> 24:37.645
Well, so do it.

24:37.712 --> 24:41.449
He started coaching at Carlton for me.

24:41.515 --> 24:44.518
I mean, he's doing
everything he can to--

24:44.585 --> 24:47.655
you know, do the dad thing.

24:47.722 --> 24:50.925
So don't do it. Carlton
could get better, right?

24:51.926 --> 24:54.428
No.

24:54.495 --> 24:56.464
Hmph.

24:56.530 --> 24:59.867
Um, okay, now in the
lousy timing department,

24:59.934 --> 25:03.637
I need to tell you that bay and I

25:03.704 --> 25:06.841
are going over to melody
and Emmett's house tomorrow.

25:06.907 --> 25:09.510
Oh.

25:09.577 --> 25:12.780
- Okay.
- Bay feels Like melody doesn't like her.

25:12.847 --> 25:17.418
So I thought maybe they should
get to know each other better.

25:17.485 --> 25:19.653
Okay.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.792
Okay? That's it?

25:26.927 --> 25:30.431
What do you want me to say?
I hate my basketball team.

25:30.498 --> 25:32.500
I miss Emmett. Angelo's back.

25:32.566 --> 25:34.869
And I don't like sharing you with bay.

25:34.935 --> 25:36.971
But it is what it is.

25:43.811 --> 25:46.999
No, I believe you, it just feels wrong.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.653
All right. Yes.

25:49.653 --> 25:52.122
Okay.

25:52.189 --> 25:55.526
That was our
lawyer-- Amanda. - And?

25:55.592 --> 25:58.395
She says Tina Choi is right.

25:58.462 --> 26:00.597
If she or anyone else
wants to use public record

26:00.664 --> 26:03.300
and gossip to write a
book about us, they can.

26:03.367 --> 26:05.502
She had no other suggestions?

26:05.569 --> 26:07.304
To collaborate with her,

26:07.371 --> 26:09.473
try to influence what she writes.

26:09.540 --> 26:12.142
Is that such a bad idea?

26:12.209 --> 26:14.478
Tina Choi wants to make
us sound like freaks!

26:14.545 --> 26:17.381
Regina is the single alcoholic mother

26:17.448 --> 26:19.416
with the sweet handicapped child.

26:19.483 --> 26:22.219
We're the midwestern royalty

26:22.286 --> 26:25.389
saddled with raising the
RAVEN-haired hell raiser.

26:25.456 --> 26:27.424
She said that?

26:27.491 --> 26:30.227
In So many words. If I sign
on to collaborate with her,

26:30.294 --> 26:32.262
she's not going to listen
to what I have to say

26:32.329 --> 26:34.198
she's gonna use my name to legitimize

26:34.264 --> 26:37.334
whatever salacious slant she
thinks is gonna sell books.

26:37.401 --> 26:39.603
I'll call Amanda.

26:39.670 --> 26:43.474
Why? You think she's going to tell you
something different than she told me?

26:43.540 --> 26:45.175
I don't know. Maybe.

26:45.242 --> 26:47.211
- I'll give her a push.
- I pushed.

26:47.277 --> 26:48.545
That's her answer.

26:48.612 --> 26:50.447
I can handle it.

26:52.282 --> 26:54.451
Okay.

26:55.552 --> 26:58.188
So what's your zodiac sign?

26:58.255 --> 27:00.491
Libra.

27:02.526 --> 27:04.428
My birthday is October 22nd.

27:04.495 --> 27:06.497
No, your birthday
is June 24th--

27:06.563 --> 27:09.133
- it's cancer.
- Right.

27:09.199 --> 27:10.501
Sorry. I'm a little nervous.

27:10.567 --> 27:14.567
Hey, uh, mom made some
extra artichoke dip.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.508
It's Toby's favorite. Where is he?

27:17.574 --> 27:21.211
- He's getting ink Cartridges.
- Lots of Carlton kids

27:21.278 --> 27:23.414
in need of novelty I.D.S.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.582
Mmm, this stuff is amazing.

27:25.649 --> 27:28.318
- You have a fake I.D.?
- yep.

27:28.385 --> 27:31.188
Daphne Rabinsky from
pleasantville, New York.

27:31.255 --> 27:33.190
I'm going to Joey's tonight with Simone

27:33.257 --> 27:35.526
and some other girls from
the Buckner basketball team.

27:35.592 --> 27:38.295
Thanks,
Wilke. - Mm-hmm.

27:38.362 --> 27:41.365
Excellent. Toby Would've loved it.

27:49.673 --> 27:52.309
- Hey.
- Yeah?

27:52.376 --> 27:55.212
I just wanted to
tell you to, uh uh--

27:55.279 --> 27:58.348
be careful with Simone.

27:58.415 --> 28:03.187
- What do you mean?
- Simone can be kind of...

28:05.189 --> 28:07.357
what?

28:07.424 --> 28:10.294
You know what? Never mind.

28:12.362 --> 28:14.298
Wow!

28:14.364 --> 28:16.600
You got Emmett. You dated Ty.

28:16.667 --> 28:19.136
You didn't want me to be with liam

28:19.203 --> 28:22.206
and now you're warning me off of someone
you're not even friends with anymore?

28:22.272 --> 28:26.176
You're right. My bad. Have a good time.

28:26.243 --> 28:27.578
I will.

29:05.616 --> 29:07.484
Hi.

29:07.551 --> 29:09.319
Oh, um, artichoke dip.

29:12.289 --> 29:14.658
No, it was me and my mom.

29:16.460 --> 29:19.530
My other Mom.

29:32.576 --> 29:36.547
Don't interpret for me. I want
melody to see that I'm trying.

29:36.613 --> 29:38.449
Okay.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.201
Let the games begin.

30:05.209 --> 30:08.479
- Now what?
- The bouncer barely even looked at your I.D.

30:08.545 --> 30:11.248
- Where did you get this?
- Wilke.

30:11.315 --> 30:15.486
I am so talking to him
tomorrow. Or maybe tonight.

30:15.552 --> 30:19.456
Wilke, you're too early. I don't
have my beer goggles on yet.

30:19.523 --> 30:22.393
Oh! Usually by 9:00 that's
all you were wearing.

30:22.459 --> 30:24.328
Wait Wait-- were
you guys together?

30:24.395 --> 30:27.331
- Briefly.
- And then I released him into the wild.

30:27.398 --> 30:29.333
Hey, we've got a table.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.468
Come on, you can bring
your friend here, as long as

30:31.535 --> 30:33.470
he promises to do everything we say.

30:33.537 --> 30:36.206
- I'm in.
- Wilke.

30:36.273 --> 30:39.276
- What are you doing here?
- You invited me.

30:39.343 --> 30:41.478
Well, you told me where
you'd be, who you'd be with.

30:41.545 --> 30:44.248
In Some cultures That'd be
considered a marriage proposal.

30:44.314 --> 30:48.385
- I'm serious.
- And I make you laugh, that's why we're so good together.

30:48.452 --> 30:51.121
We're not together. We're just friends.

30:51.188 --> 30:54.258
So I completely misread
the making out in the car,

30:54.324 --> 30:56.260
the heart-to-heart
conversation on the dock--

30:56.326 --> 30:58.395
I might have sent some mixed signals.

30:58.462 --> 31:00.497
But it doesn't change how I feel.

31:00.564 --> 31:03.233
I love talking
to you, Wilke--

31:03.300 --> 31:05.369
but you're just not my type.

31:08.305 --> 31:10.607
So what's your type? Deaf and into bay?

31:12.576 --> 31:15.312
- This is not about Emmett.
- Really?

31:15.379 --> 31:17.514
- It's not!
- Okay.

31:17.581 --> 31:19.583
Well, message received.

31:32.463 --> 31:33.831
You want that?

31:39.470 --> 31:41.639
Park place is a good property.

32:05.596 --> 32:08.700
I'm sorry. I missed a lot of that.

32:20.411 --> 32:22.580
I like to win too.

32:27.452 --> 32:30.455
Ahem, Daphne's the
only-- - I got it.

32:34.392 --> 32:36.394
It's fine.

32:36.461 --> 32:38.563
I know that you guys hang out a lot.

32:46.404 --> 32:48.506
What did I do?

32:48.573 --> 32:50.475
You signed "Hang out" Wrong.

32:50.541 --> 32:52.677
You said "I know you guys
get circumcised a lot."

32:57.582 --> 32:59.684
You're laughing at me.

33:02.754 --> 33:03.855
Melody, Stop.

33:08.593 --> 33:12.497
You know what?
This obviously--

33:12.563 --> 33:15.533
thank you for the lovely evening.

33:16.601 --> 33:18.403
I'll just--
I'll text you.

33:20.638 --> 33:22.373
I'll drive you.

33:23.541 --> 33:25.710
What's the matter with you?

33:30.448 --> 33:34.352
Bay is my daughter and
your son's girlfriend.

33:34.419 --> 33:37.422
You owe her an apology.

33:55.373 --> 33:56.774
No way!

33:56.841 --> 33:59.644
?T× You're still a stranger ?T×

33:59.711 --> 34:02.647
?T× you've got no shame ?T×

34:02.714 --> 34:04.482
?T× I'll watch you walking... ?T×

34:04.549 --> 34:08.549
Oh, all teeth. And I'm betting
he had salami for dinner.

34:08.853 --> 34:11.456
Eww!

34:12.456 --> 34:14.359
What did you say to him?

34:14.425 --> 34:16.627
- "Wanna make out?"
- subtle.

34:16.694 --> 34:19.597
Okay, Daphne, your turn.

34:19.664 --> 34:21.733
No no no, Daphne's not
a part of the team yet,

34:21.799 --> 34:23.735
so she doesn't have to take the dare.

34:23.801 --> 34:26.304
I'm sorry, it's kinda dark
in here. What'd you say?

34:26.371 --> 34:28.572
- You don't have to take the dare.
- Pffft!

34:28.639 --> 34:31.576
You think I can't do it? Pick the guy.

34:31.641 --> 34:34.379
Here's to the competitive spirit.

34:35.780 --> 34:38.483
Okay, um, let's see...

34:39.717 --> 34:41.386
him.

34:41.452 --> 34:44.554
- "Do you wanna make out"?
- it works every Time.

34:51.696 --> 34:54.431
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:57.635 --> 35:00.571
don't look now, but
my friends over there

35:00.638 --> 35:03.474
dared me to come over here and kiss you.

35:03.541 --> 35:05.376
Do you mind?

35:06.844 --> 35:09.547
- Not a bit.
- I'll take that as a yes then.

35:11.716 --> 35:14.552
?T× I hope you're happy ?T×

35:14.619 --> 35:16.587
- ?T× it's such a shame... ?T×
- girl, yeah!

35:16.654 --> 35:18.423
?T× You wear the snakeskin... ?T×

35:18.489 --> 35:20.491
what the hell are you doing?

35:20.558 --> 35:22.527
She came on to me!

35:22.593 --> 35:25.396
- It was a dare.
- Do I look stupid to you?

35:25.463 --> 35:28.733
Excuse me, but my friend's
colostomy bag is about to explode.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.568
How could you do that to me?

35:30.635 --> 35:32.403
- Come on.
- I go to the bathroom...

35:32.470 --> 35:35.306
- Let's get out of here.
- Did you just say I have a colostomy bag?

35:35.373 --> 35:38.309
- Let's go.
- Hey, we need to pay.

35:38.376 --> 35:40.678
Oh, um, I'll take care of it.
I'll meet you guys out front.

35:40.745 --> 35:44.649
- Okay, Cool.
- Hey, um, I am so Sorry about that.

35:44.716 --> 35:48.353
What're you talking
about? That was really fun!

35:48.419 --> 35:49.554
Okay, good.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.589
- I'll see you in a second.
- Okay.

35:53.391 --> 35:55.360
?T× All into shapes ?T×

35:55.426 --> 35:57.762
?T× and into shards ?T×

35:57.829 --> 35:59.731
?T× we smash like glass ?T×

35:59.797 --> 36:02.667
?T× we fall like stars ?T×

36:02.734 --> 36:04.469
?T× leave it alone. ?T×

36:05.536 --> 36:07.605
Snooki polizzi wrote a book.

36:07.672 --> 36:09.707
Valerie bertinelli, she wrote a book.

36:09.774 --> 36:13.578
Kendra Wilkinson--
she wrote two.

36:13.644 --> 36:18.349
Who's Kendra Wilkinson? - One
of Hugh Hefner's ex-girlfriends.

36:18.416 --> 36:20.651
And Keith Richards? He pickled his brain

36:20.718 --> 36:23.721
on heroin and meth for 20
years and even he wrote a book.

36:23.788 --> 36:27.492
Actually I think Keith
wrote this with Somebody.

36:27.558 --> 36:31.496
Whatever. The point is if all of these
people can write Books about their lives,

36:31.562 --> 36:35.299
why can't I? No one knows
my story better than I do.

36:35.366 --> 36:39.337
And I got straight "A"s in
english all through college--

36:39.404 --> 36:42.473
INCLUDING Two Upper-Division
creative writing classes.

36:42.540 --> 36:46.477
And if I get stuck, I can
always get someone to help me.

36:46.544 --> 36:48.713
Like Kendra?

36:50.415 --> 36:52.517
Honey. What do you think?

36:52.583 --> 36:55.353
I think it is an outstanding idea.

36:55.420 --> 36:57.522
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:57.588 --> 36:59.490
- You know what I say?
- Hmm?

36:59.557 --> 37:01.592
I say Tina Choi can go pound sand.

37:03.661 --> 37:05.830
Ah Ah ahh
ah! - But--

37:12.837 --> 37:17.308
she is a total bitch. - Honestly,
I've never seen her like that--

37:17.375 --> 37:19.377
so it's me. I bring
out the worst in her?

37:19.444 --> 37:21.646
- I didn't say that.
- It can't be because I'm hearing.

37:21.713 --> 37:23.481
You're hearing and she loves you.

37:23.548 --> 37:26.551
I don't think Emmett's ever been
this serious about someone before.

37:26.617 --> 37:29.520
I think it's probably just scary
for her to think about losing him.

37:29.587 --> 37:33.424
Okay, so the mama bear syndrome?
That makes it all right?

37:33.491 --> 37:36.427
- I didn't say that.
- You are totally defending her.

37:36.494 --> 37:39.630
She's my best friend. She's been
there for me and I owe her a lot.

37:39.697 --> 37:42.433
That's right, I forgot-- and
you don't owe me anything. - Bay.

37:42.500 --> 37:46.500
Do you ever notice that there
is always someone between us?

40:58.262 --> 41:01.366
Hey, forget your key?

41:01.432 --> 41:03.534
No. I saw you through the window.

41:03.601 --> 41:05.436
I needed to talk to you.

41:05.503 --> 41:07.538
Sure. What's up?

41:07.605 --> 41:11.342
I decided to take coach Medlock's offer.

41:11.409 --> 41:14.278
I'm going to join the Buckner team.

41:14.345 --> 41:16.381
I thought we discussed this.

41:16.447 --> 41:19.417
No, I floated the idea
and you shot it down.

41:19.484 --> 41:22.420
I shot-- I didn't
shoot anything down.

41:22.487 --> 41:26.324
I simply reminded you that you happen
to be committed to another team.

41:26.391 --> 41:29.427
It's not even a team! No one
cares if we win except me and you!

41:29.494 --> 41:31.496
Daphne, I know this is frustrating,

41:31.562 --> 41:34.365
but we're building.
These things take time.

41:34.432 --> 41:37.268
You are always telling us to take
the shot when we get the chance

41:37.335 --> 41:40.171
because we might not get another
one. Well, that's what I'm doing.

41:40.238 --> 41:42.473
We're in the middle of a season.

41:42.540 --> 41:46.177
Okay, sweetie, you
cannot quit your team.

41:46.244 --> 41:48.179
- Do not quit your team.
- I know you don't care about this,

41:48.246 --> 41:50.548
but there are so many things in my life
that I don't like-- - I do care about this.

41:50.615 --> 41:54.185
--
-And can't change. I can change.Hing

41:54.252 --> 41:56.521
I'm sorry. I know you're mad,

41:56.587 --> 41:59.424
but I'm doing it.

42:02.593 --> 42:04.562
Good night.
