00:01.502 --> 00:02.670
- You know how to tell me
and Eddie apart, right?

00:04.305 --> 00:05.306
He's got an extra tooth
right here.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.607
- Jake, Eddie's here.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.309
He wanted to see you.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.377
- It's my daughter.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.245
Lily!
- Is Lily okay?

00:11.279 --> 00:12.580
- How did you get here?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.248
- Is there anything
you're not telling me?

00:14.282 --> 00:16.384
- I'm not Lily.
- Then who are you?

00:16.417 --> 00:19.320
- I would know you
no matter what.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.489
I remember what you did.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.591
- Do you still think about what
your life would look like

00:23.624 --> 00:26.026
if things had happened
another way?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.262
- Hey!

00:28.296 --> 00:30.231
I need to talk to these kids.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.266
- They're all
in the same class.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.403
- It has been a strange
couple days.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.105
Do you believe in
intuition?

00:37.138 --> 00:40.208
Something felt wrong today.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.243
Take that mask off.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.515
- So what color
is the river?

02:27.548 --> 02:31.319
- Uh, bluish
and sometimes greenish.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.788
- What--what color's the sky?
- Blue.

02:34.822 --> 02:39.360
- And what color is
chocolate milk?

02:39.393 --> 02:40.528
- Pink!

02:40.561 --> 02:42.330
- [chuckling]
No, it's not.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.498
It's chocolate colored.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.534
- Good morning.
- Ah, good morning.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.402
- How're you doing, kid?
- Good.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.671
- Mm.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.806
Ah.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.643
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.977
I did.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.580
I dreamt we all
went to the beach.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.550
- Well, good dreams
are nature's Prozac.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.552
- Yeah.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.222
Been so long, I felt like I was
having somebody else's dream.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.496
Oh.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.331

03:44.358 --> 03:45.659
But the wounds...

03:45.693 --> 03:46.694
the footprints.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.263
- It was kids.
- Yeah.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.599
- We found Daphne Bell, too.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.768
Dead a couple days.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.738
In Frances Booth's basement.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.674
And we found
"Candle Cove" props--

04:00.708 --> 04:03.411
- In Frances Booth's basement?
- Yes.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.548
- You found props from
"Candle Cove"

04:07.581 --> 04:09.383
in Frances Booth's basement?

04:09.417 --> 04:11.485
All--all that stuff
to make the show?

04:11.519 --> 04:13.287
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.556
I'm gonna need your help.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.692
I actually thought
it was over.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.931
Ugh.

- Mike.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.450

- Is she here, Marla?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.485
- She--she's outside.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.492
- Are you bleeding?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.829
- Oh, it's, uh...

06:03.030 --> 06:04.498
It's nothing.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.600
- I'm gonna go and get her.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.801
- Mike,
what happened here?

06:07.835 --> 06:10.538
How does a six-year-old girl
just show up?

06:10.571 --> 06:11.905
- Mommy!

06:11.939 --> 06:14.475
- Hi, bunny.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.578
It's good to see you.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.979
Okay.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.915
Well, time to say bye, okay?

06:24.985 --> 06:28.021
- My guess is,
she killed Daphne, herself,

06:28.055 --> 06:29.923
and directed them
to kill Jessica.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.425
- Come on, Amy.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.560
We know these kids.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.627
There's no way.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.195
- You heard what
the coroner said.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.564
You saw the footprints.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.931
- Kids aren't
capable of that.

06:37.965 --> 06:41.001
- Under the right
circumstances...

06:41.034 --> 06:43.571
kids are capable
of almost anything.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.840
- We're talking about somebody
carving up Jessica here.

06:46.874 --> 06:50.678
- Children's brains are--
are like clay.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.813
An authority figure like
Frances Booth

06:52.846 --> 06:54.648
could take advantage.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.717
- This is all hands on deck.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.819
First thing is we pick up
the four kids I saw.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.221
I want to talk to them now.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.757
Then we knock on every door,

07:03.791 --> 07:05.726
we call every friend,
every relative,

07:05.759 --> 07:09.697
every former student,
until we find Frances Booth.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.865
Okay?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.467
Good.

- Yeah?

07:23.911 --> 07:27.481

07:27.515 --> 07:28.849
- I want to see that house.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.051
- We searched it.
- No, no, no, um...

07:31.084 --> 07:34.688
I-I, um...I need to see
the basement, you know?

07:34.722 --> 07:37.257
The stuff she was using
to make the show.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.627
You never even saw
"Candle Cove."

07:39.660 --> 07:42.963
- It's a crime scene, Mike.
You can't go messing around.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.032
- You come with me.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.634
- No, we have to
bring these kids in.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.901
That's first.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.003
- Send someone else.
- Who? Look around.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.005
It's all hands on deck.

07:52.039 --> 07:55.509

07:55.543 --> 07:58.579

- Everyone's busy.

08:00.914 --> 08:06.820
*

08:06.854 --> 08:09.657
- Not everyone.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.725
- No, he is locked up
on felony charges--

08:11.759 --> 08:15.763
- These are--are unique
circumstances.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.668
- Mike, he just found out
about Jessica.

08:22.770 --> 08:26.540
- All the more reason that
he'll want to help.

Thanks for stopping by.

Eddie, is there
anything going on

11:47.474 --> 11:49.709
that you'd like to
tell me about?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.884

13:15.362 --> 13:17.865

to tell you.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.400
Something wonderful.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.569
- Why don't you come inside
and tell me?

13:22.602 --> 13:25.505
- Thanks for inviting me
into my own house.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.942
But I don't think
that's a good idea.

13:28.976 --> 13:33.346
I doubt Gary's capable of
a rational conversation.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.016
I have somewhere else in mind.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.485
I'd like you to meet me there.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.553

if we could speak alone.

can't find him or Alex.

No, you don't.

Trust me, we don't know
how much danger we're in yet.

You did your job.
That's good.

I'm gonna come with you--
I will come with you, okay?

Just give me a second.

No better feeling than seeing
your kids well-fed.

who took him away.

- Well, now I'm here
to reunite you.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.327

tell me something.

Tell me about
"Candle Cove."

- Why?

30:06.172 --> 30:07.239
And why us?

30:07.273 --> 30:10.276
- You are such
a stubborn man.

Once or twice in a lifetime,

30:19.285 --> 30:21.888
if you're lucky...

30:21.921 --> 30:25.391
there are moments.

Someone slices the world open
right down the middle

30:28.928 --> 30:31.430
and you can see
the sky behind it.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.000
The true world.

30:34.033 --> 30:37.369
And you understand
your purpose.

30:37.403 --> 30:40.072
- And this was your purpose?

30:41.673 --> 30:45.611
- Nothing's sadder
than a life without purpose.

30:45.644 --> 30:48.314
And I had a life like that.

30:48.347 --> 30:52.051
You keep telling yourself
to be grateful.

30:52.084 --> 30:55.187
Have faith.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.356
I loved my son.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.960
I did.

31:00.993 --> 31:03.429
But I was just a void,

31:03.462 --> 31:08.267
wasting life
and space and air.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.939
And powerless.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.174
Then something extraordinary
happened.

31:17.476 --> 31:21.313
I found myself in the presence
of something greater.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.918
He showed me his power.

31:27.353 --> 31:31.323
Something majestic that flowered
from indignity.

31:33.025 --> 31:36.128
- He?

31:36.162 --> 31:39.465
- I didn't create
"Candle Cove."

31:39.498 --> 31:41.233
Eddie did.

*

32:01.287 --> 32:04.190
What are you talking about?

32:04.223 --> 32:08.127
You thought
"Candle Cove" found him.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.397
But what he had
was always there.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.532
He was born with it.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.267
He's the light.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.203
The beacon.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.505
He always was.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.441
- He's dead.

32:22.474 --> 32:26.178
- Only in the literal sense.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.747
He's coming back.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.549
You're almost ready.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.085
You just have to
let him in.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.756
A fire needs fuel.

32:37.789 --> 32:41.427
Power demands sacrifice.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.130

33:02.148 --> 33:05.184
How did you do
what you did?

33:05.217 --> 33:07.486
- I'm special.

33:07.519 --> 33:10.522
- Those things I saw,
that...

33:12.591 --> 33:14.760
That place.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.097
Did you show me that?

33:20.232 --> 33:22.234
- Want me to
show you again?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.505
- Please.

33:26.538 --> 33:30.409
- I'm not
strong enough yet.

33:30.442 --> 33:34.080
I need you to
do something for me.

33:34.113 --> 33:38.050
Give me something.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.418
- Anything.

33:39.451 --> 33:46.458
*

34:02.408 --> 34:04.510
- Jake.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.245
Eddie's here.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.846
He wanted to see you.

34:07.879 --> 34:15.087
*

34:16.855 --> 34:19.491
- You killed your own son?

34:19.525 --> 34:22.628
- I fed him to a fire.

34:22.661 --> 34:26.165
So it could burn
even brighter.

34:28.234 --> 34:31.470
Now it's your turn.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.272
Even after all I've done,

34:33.305 --> 34:36.142
you make him
a hundred times stronger

34:36.175 --> 34:39.211
just by being here.

34:39.245 --> 34:42.448
You were both born with
something special.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.483
He needs you.

34:46.352 --> 34:48.454
That's why he wanted you
to put him to rest--

34:48.487 --> 34:50.489
it had to be you.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.326
He loves you.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.696
He's broken you down.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.632
But only to make you ready.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.669
Only because
you fought so hard.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.443
He's coming back.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.213
Through you.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.382
You are his blood.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.917
You body is his body.

35:18.950 --> 35:23.555
He can live again in flesh.

[sighs]

35:26.458 --> 35:29.461
You can feel it,
can't you?

35:29.495 --> 35:32.498
It's already begun.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.167
The sooner you let him in,

35:35.201 --> 35:38.204
the sooner he'll
take your pain away.

35:42.241 --> 35:45.244
I envy you.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.721
Very soon, now.
