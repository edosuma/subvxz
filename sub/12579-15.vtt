HANK: Boy, those pictures from our trip
to the new hardware store...

00:36.594 --> 00:38.061
sure came out great.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.392
Okay, keep flipping.

00:40.498 --> 00:44.434
I finished off the roll with some pictures
of my new boyfriend, Zack.

00:45.770 --> 00:48.705
I'm Zack.
Thank you for choosing Foto Phast.

00:49.974 --> 00:52.704
So we can't blame the red eyes
on the flash.

00:52.810 --> 00:54.539
- What do we owe you?
- $12.50.

00:54.645 --> 00:56.613
No, no. Let me get it.

00:56.714 --> 01:00.616
Since Zack and I are dating,
I get his employee discount.

01:02.053 --> 01:04.214
How much do I owe you?

01:04.721 --> 01:05.689
$12.50.

01:07.792 --> 01:11.023
- No hard feelings, but it's over, Linda.
- Linda?

01:11.829 --> 01:14.297
That's not how my name is pronounced.

01:14.465 --> 01:17.400
Oh, Luanne.
Honey, he just broke up with you.

01:18.269 --> 01:19.236
Oh!

01:19.370 --> 01:20.894
Oh, God. No!

01:26.677 --> 01:30.807
Oh, honey, please don't feel bad.
It makes your uncle uncomfortable.

01:31.315 --> 01:34.478
If Zack had told me
he was gonna act like such a butt...

01:34.585 --> 01:36.678
I would have never slept with him.

01:36.787 --> 01:37.913
You what?

01:38.222 --> 01:39.189
[Gasps]

01:40.124 --> 01:41.284
Oh, no.

01:41.859 --> 01:42.951
So that means you're not...

01:43.060 --> 01:46.552
Uncle Hank, I quit being a virgin
the first time I had sex.

01:46.931 --> 01:49.024
Nobody likes a quitter, Luanne.

01:49.133 --> 01:52.830
Zack liked me.
And so did Buckley, and Brad...

01:52.937 --> 01:54.928
and Brad's ex-best friend.

01:55.373 --> 01:57.933
Well, I think they liked me.

01:58.242 --> 02:02.941
You know, Luanne, there's someone
who'll love you more if you don't put out.

02:03.447 --> 02:06.416
Why don't we swing by his bachelor pad?

02:08.252 --> 02:10.550
STROUP: Well, you are right.
She has sinned.

02:11.155 --> 02:14.716
But if young people like Luanne didn't sin,
I'd be out of a job.

02:17.361 --> 02:20.922
Seriously, Luanne,
there is a way to restore your purity.

02:21.766 --> 02:22.755
She's listening.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.358
She can become a born-again virgin.

02:25.469 --> 02:27.164
How do you pull that one off?

02:27.271 --> 02:29.501
It's a religious ceremony we perform.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.973
All you have to do is promise
not to have sex again...

02:32.076 --> 02:34.601
until you're married and log 14 hours...

02:34.712 --> 02:37.306
in our
Youth Abstinence Outreach Program.

02:37.415 --> 02:39.679
So, Luanne, are you interested?

02:40.184 --> 02:42.709
I'm willing to try anything once.

02:44.555 --> 02:48.753
Mr. And Mrs. Hill, are you willing to be
Luanne's virginity sponsors?

02:49.126 --> 02:52.254
Sponsor?
You mean like what the drunks have?

02:52.363 --> 02:54.593
Mr. Hill, a celibacy sponsor is like...

02:54.698 --> 02:57.633
an offensive lineman
for the virgin quarterback.

02:58.035 --> 03:00.799
The other team is gonna be
coming on strong.

03:00.905 --> 03:03.806
So Luanne needs you
to get out there and block.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.840
Or she may very well get sacked.

03:07.545 --> 03:10.912
Well, that's not in the Bible,
but it should be. I'll do it.

03:16.620 --> 03:17.848
STROUP: Okay, people.

03:17.955 --> 03:22.085
Who's ready to engage in a frank
and open discussion of fornication?

03:22.660 --> 03:27.256
May I remind you that there is a poster
of Jesus behind that ping-pong table?

03:27.364 --> 03:29.525
Oh, of course. Thanks, Hank.

03:29.633 --> 03:33.797
There will be ping-pong
and pasta salad after we finish.

03:34.138 --> 03:37.403
Now let's break into
male and female discussion groups...

03:37.508 --> 03:40.102
and share our detailed sexual histories.

03:40.711 --> 03:43.612
We're going to kick things off today
by testifying...

03:43.714 --> 03:46.979
to the number of sexual partners
each of us has had.

03:47.551 --> 03:48.609
Four.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.812
So close to five.

03:52.556 --> 03:54.148
Anyway, Hank?

03:54.458 --> 03:58.087
What? No, thank you.
I'm just here as a sponsor.

03:58.195 --> 04:01.653
Yeah, and as a role model
for our emerging virgins...

04:01.999 --> 04:05.457
your insights could make the difference
between going all the way...

04:05.569 --> 04:08.003
and going all the way to heaven.

04:08.806 --> 04:09.773
[Sighs]

04:09.940 --> 04:11.669
Well, okay.

04:12.109 --> 04:13.804
I had my share of girlfriends...

04:13.911 --> 04:17.278
but coach always told me
to save it for football.

04:17.380 --> 04:20.714
Which I did. And then I met Peggy Platter.

04:21.051 --> 04:23.315
And things got kind of heavy.

04:23.587 --> 04:26.681
But she insisted
we wait until our wedding night.

04:26.790 --> 04:29.258
And I thank her every day for that.

04:29.827 --> 04:32.421
So the answer's one. Next.

04:32.663 --> 04:33.823
LARRY: Rhett.

04:34.532 --> 04:36.363
I had just one, too.

04:36.834 --> 04:40.031
But we weren't married. I hate myself.

04:41.472 --> 04:43.997
I was getting a massage.

04:44.108 --> 04:46.542
This sort of thing happens every day.

04:46.644 --> 04:50.307
A young man, naked in a massage parlor...

04:51.282 --> 04:55.309
No, sir. I wasn't at a massage parlor.

04:55.419 --> 04:58.445
I was at an arts and crafts fair.
I took my shirt off.

04:58.556 --> 05:00.421
Stupid, stupid Rhett.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.558
Then she put me face down
on this padded...

05:04.161 --> 05:07.494
I don't know what, a sex chair,
and started rubbing my shoulders.

05:07.598 --> 05:11.591
And then she brushed against me.
And she smelled so good.

05:12.703 --> 05:16.002
I felt this...

05:18.108 --> 05:21.475
And then I sinned my pants.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.941
Oh, that's not losing your virginity.

05:25.049 --> 05:27.449
All you lost was those pants.

05:28.185 --> 05:32.144
I mostly work with propane,
so why don't I just go do that?

05:34.491 --> 05:37.221
STROUP:18, and 19.

05:38.062 --> 05:41.520
Well, when you say it,
it doesn't sound like much.

05:41.632 --> 05:46.126
But when you're sitting there with
19 Hershey's Kisses in front of you...

05:46.437 --> 05:48.428
that's a lot of chocolate.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.637
- Barbara?
- Six.

05:50.874 --> 05:51.898
Very good.

05:52.009 --> 05:53.874
I'm the youngest one here.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.209
I can't tell them
I've had sex with four men.

05:57.681 --> 05:59.342
They'll think I'm a slut.

05:59.450 --> 06:01.611
It does not matter what they think.

06:01.719 --> 06:04.984
You have a forgiving God
and a tough but fair aunt.

06:05.089 --> 06:06.249
Luanne?

06:07.758 --> 06:09.817
- Four.
- Four.

06:10.594 --> 06:11.686
Peggy?

06:12.229 --> 06:14.197
One. My husband.

06:14.398 --> 06:17.856
Well, good for you.
Ladies, this is a model for us all.

06:17.968 --> 06:19.731
Oh, no, please. I'm not.

06:20.437 --> 06:22.029
Oh, yes, you are.

06:22.373 --> 06:25.831
You are an inspiration, a holy beacon.

06:26.410 --> 06:29.072
We may not all be able to
match your rectitude...

06:29.179 --> 06:32.615
but God has truly prepared
a special place for you.

06:32.716 --> 06:33.876
Two.

06:33.984 --> 06:37.181
- I'm sorry?
- I would like one more chocolate, please.

06:37.454 --> 06:39.615
- Are you hungry, hon?
- No.

06:40.491 --> 06:43.585
I slept with another man
before I met my husband.

06:44.728 --> 06:46.252
STROUP: And two.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.498
Luanne, it was my very best male friend,
Wayne Trotter.

06:59.610 --> 07:01.441
People always thought
we were going steady...

07:01.545 --> 07:05.072
but there'd never been
anything romantic between us until...

07:05.182 --> 07:07.878
one day we were at Pier 1.

07:07.985 --> 07:10.977
He sat me down in a wicker chair
and took my hand.

07:11.088 --> 07:13.318
He had beautiful hands.

07:13.857 --> 07:18.021
And he said to me,
"Peggy, I think I might be gay."

07:18.328 --> 07:22.196
And this was back when being gay
in Texas was not as fun as it is today.

07:22.499 --> 07:25.024
We decided that
the only way to know for sure...

07:25.135 --> 07:28.002
was to test him with Peggy Platter.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.103
So, we went back to Wayne's house...

07:31.208 --> 07:33.540
gently pushed aside
his decorative throw pillows...

07:33.644 --> 07:36.204
and then... Oh, yeah.

07:36.780 --> 07:38.304
Did you fix him?

07:38.415 --> 07:42.078
Oh, no, Luanne.
He was not broken. Just gay.

07:42.886 --> 07:45.320
Very, very gay.

07:46.523 --> 07:48.320
Are you ladies decent?

07:48.892 --> 07:50.951
Hey, you guys got chocolate?

07:51.061 --> 07:52.653
Boy, am I jealous.

08:00.070 --> 08:04.200
Welcome, virgins,
soon-to-be virgins, sponsors...

08:04.308 --> 08:07.243
and fans of premarital abstinence.

08:07.344 --> 08:11.007
Will the sponsors of Luanne Platter
please step forward?

08:13.484 --> 08:16.817
Luanne, before God and man...

08:17.187 --> 08:20.850
your next breath will be
as if it were your first.

08:22.559 --> 08:23.526
[Shrieking]

08:24.128 --> 08:25.789
I'm a virgin!

08:26.029 --> 08:28.224
[Luanne laughing excitedly]

08:35.839 --> 08:37.669
What's up? Want to play some B?

08:37.775 --> 08:41.734
She is no longer interested in catching
what you're throwing, mister.

08:43.246 --> 08:47.980
Okay. Everyone who hasn't had
premarital sex gets ice cream.

08:48.085 --> 08:49.074
Oh, dear God.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.621
Well, I wouldn't tell him.

08:58.162 --> 09:01.996
I just feel so terrible.
I cannot sleep. I cannot eat.

09:02.099 --> 09:03.726
I have already lost a pound.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.665
You look wonderful, sug'.

09:05.769 --> 09:06.929
I agree.

09:07.037 --> 09:09.870
Normally, I would say so
with a lot more enthusiasm...

09:09.973 --> 09:12.066
but I am under a lot of stress.

09:13.877 --> 09:16.209
No sex equals great sex!

09:16.313 --> 09:19.180
No sex equals great sex!

09:19.349 --> 09:20.839
Oh, Bobby.

09:21.251 --> 09:23.446
I need to talk to you and...

09:24.121 --> 09:27.147
"your peer group" about your virginity.

09:27.291 --> 09:30.920
I am not having sex until at least
my sophomore year at Harvard.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.052
You heard her.

09:32.162 --> 09:34.824
Not until our sophomore year at Harvard.

09:34.932 --> 09:37.492
Your virginity is in danger now!

09:37.601 --> 09:40.365
You need to sign
this abstinence pledge card...

09:40.470 --> 09:43.837
before you discover
how wonderful sex feels.

09:44.308 --> 09:45.775
Keep talking.

09:45.876 --> 09:49.607
Okay. In addition to heaven...

09:50.080 --> 09:52.742
there are other benefits to this pledge.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.884
You get a 10% discount on CDs,
movies, bowling and video games.

09:56.987 --> 10:00.548
And a free MP3 player
if you sign up 10 other virgins.

10:03.193 --> 10:04.785
We sure got lucky.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.261
When we were 18
we were already married.

10:07.364 --> 10:10.197
If we'd had to wait any longer,
who knows what kind of trouble...

10:10.300 --> 10:11.858
we would have gotten into?

10:11.969 --> 10:13.596
With each other, of course.

10:13.704 --> 10:17.731
Boy. Thank God for my free weights
and your strong moral fiber.

10:17.875 --> 10:21.038
My virtue is not the issue, Hank.
This is about Luanne.

10:21.144 --> 10:22.441
Well, that's what scares me.

10:22.546 --> 10:25.982
She's got nowhere near your upbringing
or self-control.

10:26.416 --> 10:29.214
I'll be damned if I'm gonna raise her baby.

10:29.486 --> 10:33.149
We've got to find her a good boy
with strong values.

10:33.757 --> 10:35.281
Hey, I know a guy.

10:38.161 --> 10:39.219
Yeah!

10:39.329 --> 10:41.297
That's quite a hook you got there, Rhett.

10:41.398 --> 10:42.990
I spend a lot of time bowling.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.466
I can't imagine a bigger rush
than picking up a spare.

10:45.569 --> 10:46.763
Ain't that so?

10:47.638 --> 10:50.038
Rhett, this is my niece, Luanne.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.902
She loves bowling and self-control.

10:53.176 --> 10:54.143
Hi.

11:00.183 --> 11:01.480
I'm Rhett.

11:02.786 --> 11:04.913
I saw you at the virgin thing.

11:06.223 --> 11:08.691
I got kicked out for already being one.

11:12.229 --> 11:14.697
You wanna bowl? It's totally not a sin.

11:14.798 --> 11:16.629
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:19.369 --> 11:20.427
Oh, sure.

11:20.537 --> 11:23.836
TV and movies might make
premarital sex look good...

11:23.941 --> 11:25.875
but it's dangerous.

11:25.976 --> 11:30.003
It's caused broken homes,
broken hearts, depression...

11:34.451 --> 11:35.748
I'll sign.

11:36.954 --> 11:39.422
Who wants to play miniature golf
Friday night?

11:39.523 --> 11:41.286
- $2 off.
- Yo.

11:41.825 --> 11:44.692
Sorry, but that's the night
of the Abstinence Dance.

11:44.795 --> 11:47.958
I promised Luanne
I'd help her and Rhett chaperone.

11:48.065 --> 11:50.260
You know,
make sure the kids have a good time...

11:50.367 --> 11:51.834
but not a great one.

11:51.935 --> 11:54.597
Well, you go to your prissy little dance.

11:54.705 --> 11:57.606
Me and the boys are going
to the putt-putt range.

11:57.708 --> 12:01.166
My sources tell me that that bully
no longer works there.

12:05.549 --> 12:07.449
[Upbeat instrumental music playing]

12:34.111 --> 12:35.874
I saw her panties.

12:42.686 --> 12:44.745
[Slow romantic music playing]

12:47.791 --> 12:50.954
I feel so safe with you, Rhett.

12:51.528 --> 12:56.295
With Rad, my last committed
on-again-off-again relationship...

12:56.833 --> 13:00.462
everything we did
always seemed to lead to sex.

13:01.204 --> 13:04.401
God, Luanne. Sounds terrible.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.740
It was.

13:07.144 --> 13:10.910
Did you know that the changing table
at What-a-Burger is strong enough...

13:11.014 --> 13:13.209
to hold up one person, but not two?

13:13.316 --> 13:15.716
I thought people only had sex in bed.

13:15.819 --> 13:17.218
Or the shower.

13:17.654 --> 13:19.121
That could work, right?

13:19.222 --> 13:21.383
Or is there enough room to lie down?

13:22.559 --> 13:25.050
Real virgins are so cute.

13:25.629 --> 13:27.324
[Upbeat swing music playing]

13:32.969 --> 13:34.266
That's it!

13:37.040 --> 13:38.564
Will you marry me?

13:39.276 --> 13:40.243
[Gasps]

13:46.516 --> 13:48.347
Well, look at Bobby.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.546
I think he has finally found his sport.

13:52.956 --> 13:54.719
LUANNE: Oh, my God!

13:54.858 --> 13:56.985
Uncle Hank, Aunt Peggy...

13:57.094 --> 13:59.927
Rhett asked me to marry him
and I said yes.

14:00.030 --> 14:00.997
You what?

14:01.098 --> 14:03.259
Luanne, you barely know this guy.

14:03.366 --> 14:05.834
Yeah, but we have so much in common.

14:06.536 --> 14:09.733
We are both virgins.
In fact, that's how we met.

14:10.006 --> 14:13.703
Yes, I know.
I introduced you two days ago.

14:14.077 --> 14:17.205
And each day has been
better than the one before.

14:17.747 --> 14:20.545
May I give you a little preview
of your wedding?

14:20.650 --> 14:22.481
"Does anyone object?"

14:22.586 --> 14:24.110
"Yes, I do."

14:24.221 --> 14:25.449
"And who are you?"

14:25.555 --> 14:26.522
"Peggy Hill!"

14:26.623 --> 14:28.784
Don't you want me to get married?

14:28.892 --> 14:32.157
Of course I do, honey. But not to Rhett.

14:32.596 --> 14:35.190
When we meet the right guy for you,
we'll know.

14:35.298 --> 14:39.029
I may be a virgin, but I have been
around the block a few times...

14:39.136 --> 14:41.297
and I know when
someone's talking down at me.

14:41.404 --> 14:44.999
I am just trying to protect you
from your feelings, thoughts and instincts.

14:45.108 --> 14:47.838
I know that this is difficult for you,
Aunt Peggy...

14:47.944 --> 14:49.434
but you should be proud of me.

14:49.546 --> 14:53.346
I'm going to be the first Platter woman
to walk down the aisle a virgin.

14:53.450 --> 14:56.317
You watch it, young lady!
Your aunt and I never...

14:56.419 --> 14:59.320
No. Before she met you.
With Wayne Trotter.

14:59.422 --> 15:00.411
[Peggy gasps]

15:00.524 --> 15:01.684
Peggy?

15:03.627 --> 15:04.958
Well, it's true.

15:05.662 --> 15:08.495
He's gay now,
if that makes you feel any better.

15:08.598 --> 15:09.565
[Screams]

15:10.133 --> 15:11.828
No. Of course it doesn't.

15:14.404 --> 15:18.204
PEGGY: Well, I feel like
a huge weight has been lifted.

15:18.575 --> 15:20.042
[Laughing sheepishly]

15:20.510 --> 15:21.568
Don't you, Hank?

15:21.678 --> 15:24.238
You're the one who was always saying
we should wait.

15:24.347 --> 15:27.612
Well, it's easy to wait on dinner
when you've already had a little snack...

15:27.717 --> 15:29.048
isn't it, Peggy?

15:29.953 --> 15:31.147
I was wrong.

15:31.254 --> 15:33.654
And I did not want to make
the same mistake twice.

15:33.757 --> 15:35.349
Which mistake is that?

15:35.458 --> 15:39.121
Sleeping with him, not sleeping with me,
or lying about it for 20 years?

15:39.229 --> 15:41.789
I wanna be mad at you
for the right reasons.

15:41.932 --> 15:45.333
Well, you never told me about
all your wild escapades...

15:45.435 --> 15:47.665
when you worked at Jeans West.

15:47.804 --> 15:51.797
I told you about the time
I put on the gigantic pair of khakis...

15:51.908 --> 15:53.671
and pretended I was tiny.

15:53.777 --> 15:55.506
I was very up front about it.

15:55.612 --> 15:57.603
Hank, I cannot change the past.

15:57.747 --> 16:01.080
I can only try to convince you
that you are overreacting to it.

16:01.184 --> 16:05.052
Right now we have to stop Luanne
before she ruins her life.

16:05.155 --> 16:06.747
I'm going to Luanne's.

16:06.856 --> 16:10.758
I think it's best if you stay here
and think about what you did...

16:10.860 --> 16:12.657
and what I didn't get to do.

16:13.763 --> 16:14.730
Oh!

16:18.201 --> 16:19.998
[Luanne humming
traditional wedding song]

16:20.837 --> 16:23.499
Yes! That is the dress.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.802
Sweet merciful Jesus, that is the dress.

16:25.909 --> 16:29.572
The guy at the rental place said that
most of the girls who've worn this dress...

16:29.679 --> 16:31.044
are still married.

16:37.721 --> 16:42.158
I was going to ask Aunt Peggy
to sing the I Believe I Can Fly song...

16:42.259 --> 16:43.351
at the wedding.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.054
But now I'm not so sure.

16:46.329 --> 16:49.355
Tell you what. If you want,
I can take her off the guest list.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.434
Bill's been pushing for an invite.

16:51.534 --> 16:55.163
Luanne, as your guardian,
I cannot let you do this.

16:55.505 --> 16:57.200
Save your breath, Aunt Peggy.

16:57.307 --> 17:01.641
Nothing you could say can stop me
from becoming Mrs. Rhett Platter.

17:02.045 --> 17:04.137
Yes, I am keeping my last name.

17:04.247 --> 17:07.114
See, I was afraid
I wouldn't like your last name.

17:07.217 --> 17:10.152
- It's Vandergraff.
- Oh, I love it!

17:11.154 --> 17:13.554
I'm going to be Mrs. Rhett Vandergraff.

17:13.656 --> 17:17.058
I'm going to be Mrs. Rhett Vandergraff.

17:17.426 --> 17:19.190
The Vandergraffs.

17:19.296 --> 17:22.265
Hank, she did not know his last name.

17:22.365 --> 17:26.165
Well, at least he told her his last name
before they got married.

17:26.569 --> 17:29.299
He didn't spring it on her 20 years later.

17:29.539 --> 17:31.302
Hank, will you stop this?

17:31.408 --> 17:35.777
What is it you want from me?
An apology? Fine. I am sorry.

17:35.979 --> 17:39.574
Very, very sorry.
I have made a horrible mistake...

17:39.783 --> 17:41.580
and I have paid the price.

17:42.152 --> 17:44.677
How much longer
are you gonna punish me?

17:46.890 --> 17:49.552
If you'll excuse me,
I've got to go tell Boomhauer...

17:49.659 --> 17:52.423
we'll need his limo
for the wedding this weekend.

18:19.856 --> 18:20.823
[Gasps]

18:24.594 --> 18:26.289
[Telephone ringing]

18:30.433 --> 18:32.697
Strickland Propane. Taste the meat...

18:33.236 --> 18:34.294
I mean, hello.

18:34.404 --> 18:38.033
Hank, I just saw the virgin Luanne
climbing out her window.

18:38.141 --> 18:39.870
Her bedroom window.

18:40.076 --> 18:41.134
Oh, God.

18:46.516 --> 18:47.710
Hey!

18:48.918 --> 18:50.317
Cut it out. Knock it off.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.648
RHETT: Hey, what the...
HANK: Right now.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.620
What do you think you're doing?

18:53.723 --> 18:54.917
What are you doing?

18:55.024 --> 18:57.117
We didn't do anything.

18:57.227 --> 19:01.323
I'm so sorry, Mr. Hill. I've waited 22 years.
I couldn't wait another week.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.228
You're 22?

19:03.833 --> 19:06.358
All right. That's it.
The wedding is tomorrow.

19:06.469 --> 19:07.868
Oh, yes!

19:09.606 --> 19:11.335
Listen to me, Luanne.

19:11.441 --> 19:15.275
Getting married just so you can
sleep together is a big mistake.

19:15.378 --> 19:18.040
If I had married the first person
I slept with...

19:18.148 --> 19:19.979
I would have married Wayne Trotter.

19:20.083 --> 19:22.176
I never would have gone
sock-skating with Hank...

19:22.285 --> 19:24.947
on the linoleum
of our first studio apartment.

19:25.121 --> 19:29.080
I would have missed the way he tosses
and turns the night before Flag Day.

19:29.526 --> 19:34.088
The pride I felt the first time he used
one of my shirts as a rag.

19:35.064 --> 19:38.465
If I had done what
you're thinking of doing, Luanne...

19:38.868 --> 19:42.235
I never would have met the love of my life.

19:44.340 --> 19:45.864
Come home, Hank.

19:47.243 --> 19:49.177
Peggy, you coming to the wedding or not?

19:49.279 --> 19:53.147
The only reason I ask is, I need to know
how many burgers to defrost.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.909
Come on.

20:15.672 --> 20:19.130
Where is everyone?
I've reserved two picnic tables.

20:19.542 --> 20:22.909
- And where's Rhett?
- I canceled the wedding.

20:23.379 --> 20:25.176
- But...
- Aunt Peggy was right.

20:25.281 --> 20:28.114
We were just getting married
so we could fornicate...

20:28.218 --> 20:30.846
without you and God getting mad at us.

20:31.221 --> 20:34.748
But you and Aunt Peggy are the ones
who should be fornicating.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.691
What if Reverend Stroup heard you
talking like that?

20:37.794 --> 20:39.955
Well, Reverend Stroup thinks so, too.

20:40.063 --> 20:43.191
STROUP: Chop, chop, Hank. Let's go.
I'm getting cold in here.

20:47.203 --> 20:48.170
[Gasping]

20:50.607 --> 20:53.132
Hank, I'm a virgin!

20:54.143 --> 20:55.132
Peggy, come on.

20:55.245 --> 20:58.612
This reborn virgin stuff
is a bunch of nonsense.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.739
Sorry, Reverend...

20:59.849 --> 21:03.444
but a few churchy words and
a dunk in the lake doesn't change...

21:10.927 --> 21:14.021
Peggy, I can see your whatnots.

21:20.603 --> 21:24.630
Let's start over again, Hank.
This time, no secrets.

21:30.346 --> 21:35.045
As soon as we get you into my truck
and over there behind those trees...

21:35.418 --> 21:39.445
I want you out of this robe
so you don't catch a cold.

21:45.662 --> 21:48.597
I think someone's going
to lose her virginity.

21:49.265 --> 21:51.256
Not me. No, no.

21:51.868 --> 21:53.358
[Whispering] Aunt Peggy.

22:25.602 --> 22:27.297
HANK: The Vandergraffs.
