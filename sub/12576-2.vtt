A..ha!

00:24.967 --> 00:26.378
I'm sorry uncle Hank.

00:27.294 --> 00:30.759
What are you touching?
those are my personal under garments.

00:30.759 --> 00:33.036
Na.ah! some of them are mine.

00:33.966 --> 00:36.095
Will you look at
what your nice has done?

00:36.417 --> 00:40.154
She's got my drawers spinin' around
with her un-mentionable.

00:40.154 --> 00:43.669
Yeah..oh! scandoulas,
where's my coffee?

00:44.665 --> 00:47.834
Ooo...laundry!
hot out of the dryer.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.913
Mmm...hmm!

Hello, is there a Luanne Platter
livin' here.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.328
Well who wants' to know?

01:36.650 --> 01:40.190
Shiny pines trailer park,
ms. Platter owes six months back rent.

01:40.666 --> 01:42.077
You must have that wrong mister,

01:42.077 --> 01:45.567
Luanne doesn't have any trailer,
that's why she lives here.

01:45.567 --> 01:46.805
So she does live here.

01:47.151 --> 01:50.468
Don't play mind checkers with me man,
I'm not in the mood.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.892
- We're most reasonable people.
- You said it friend.

01:53.892 --> 01:58.150
My record show a trailer at the corner of
sherry oak lane in an unpaved access drive.

01:58.150 --> 02:00.056
Luanne Platter resident.

02:00.677 --> 02:01.788
That can't be right.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.721
Luanne used to live in a trailer,

02:03.721 --> 02:06.295
but her parent's had a fight,
the trailer tipped over,

02:06.295 --> 02:09.068
her momma went to jail and
the cops hauled it off.

02:09.068 --> 02:13.028
Sir, if you're calling me a lair, you better
be holding somthin' stronger than an umbrella!

Nine iron!

02:14.846 --> 02:16.034
Y' all have a nice day.

02:19.203 --> 02:21.703
Well they asked me
to substitute for a German class

02:21.703 --> 02:24.515
and I said 'nein'
which I thought meant 'yes',

02:24.783 --> 02:27.445
but apparently 'nein' means 'no' so..

02:27.903 --> 02:29.441
I blew a big opportunity.

02:30.057 --> 02:30.802
Luanne!

02:31.154 --> 02:32.722
why are you livin' here.

02:33.118 --> 02:36.730
Mmm..because I have no-where else to go.

02:37.178 --> 02:40.964
well, a man came by from
Shiny Pines trailer park today,

02:41.281 --> 02:43.344
and he say's
you still got a trailer there.

02:43.717 --> 02:45.285
No, I don't.
It tipped over.

02:45.285 --> 02:46.964
But it's still there.

02:46.964 --> 02:48.327
No, it tipped over.

02:48.595 --> 02:52.777
Luanne, let me try to explain.
I have a beer can,

02:53.205 --> 02:54.239
I tip it over.

02:54.857 --> 02:56.805
Now is it still there?

02:57.316 --> 03:01.236
I can't live in a beer can,
I can live in a trailer, but

03:01.236 --> 03:04.151
I don't have a trailer 'cause
the trailer's tipped over

03:05.019 --> 03:06.732
That trailer cannot be livable Hank,

03:06.943 --> 03:09.240
it's full of broken dishes and broken dreams.

03:09.461 --> 03:10.735
So, we'll clean it.

03:11.101 --> 03:13.916
Hank, if they had a sponge
that cleaned up broken dreams

03:13.916 --> 03:15.850
Wall Worth's would still be in business.

03:17.557 --> 03:19.865
Dale: Hey Hank!
what 'ya gonna winch?

03:20.150 --> 03:23.987
Luanne's daddy's trailer,
I'm gonna untip it and set it right.

03:23.987 --> 03:27.296
You know how the Egyptian's
untiped the Pyramid don't 'ya.

03:28.170 --> 03:33.053
with a winch, a cinder block and
fifty thousand Hebrew slaves.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.195
Mmm.

03:34.444 --> 03:35.522
You got a cinder block?

03:36.361 --> 03:38.837
I can get you an army tank
from the base.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.830
Yo' know it's nothing better for pushing.

03:41.104 --> 03:44.557
except for maybe a bull dozer,
but off course they..they lock those up.

03:45.591 --> 03:48.481
Look I got a truck and a winch,
you wanna stand around talking

03:48.481 --> 03:49.913
or you wanna tip that trailer.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.865

might be a tornado.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.648
This could be the disaster I've been
waiting for, so keep your fingers crossed.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.956
Dale: What about my supper?

04:06.210 --> 04:08.400
Nancy: I left the cartoon
of cigarettes on the table.

04:09.547 --> 04:11.423
Dale: Aaa! think I'll keep her.

04:13.329 --> 04:14.092
Hank: You know fellas,

04:14.436 --> 04:18.218
trailer parks are some of your largest
consumers of propane.

04:18.218 --> 04:21.702
Right behind school buses and crematorium.

04:22.301 --> 04:26.004
Pretty, pretty, pretty.
Look at all those pretty trailers.

04:26.445 --> 04:29.217

Ow! this and that.

05:35.214 --> 05:36.723
Hey. Luanne here's a thought.

05:37.015 --> 05:39.298
Wouldn't you like to have your own room?

05:39.722 --> 05:40.280
Well!

05:40.673 --> 05:41.890
Sure I would.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.204
I'd also like a date with Alex ??? but,

05:45.475 --> 05:48.667
I don't see what good it do,
since I don't have my own room.

05:49.034 --> 05:53.756
You know if that trailer wasn't tipped over
you'd have more than just your own room.

05:54.009 --> 05:55.125
What are you drivin' at?

05:55.592 --> 05:57.774
Trailer's not tipped over anymore.

05:58.129 --> 05:59.600
The guys and I took care of it..

05:59.600 --> 06:01.802
you could move in
there tomorrow if you want.

06:02.032 --> 06:03.468
Why are you doing this to me?

06:04.437 --> 06:05.289
You're welcome.

06:05.590 --> 06:06.896
Hank Hill, how could you?

06:07.266 --> 06:09.301
You are practically
pushing her at the door.

06:09.983 --> 06:11.511
Sometimes you gotta stop..

06:11.511 --> 06:14.951
vomiting in the baby birds mouth
and kick her out of the nest.

06:15.368 --> 06:19.237
Well that's a clever analogy,
but you know from our own sidewalk we're

06:19.237 --> 06:22.195
constantly wrecking up those
little dried up bird babies.

06:22.509 --> 06:24.031
Luanne is just not ready.

06:26.394 --> 06:28.090
Oh, pumpkin are you alright?

06:28.727 --> 06:30.550
I'm sorry I lost it aunt Pegg.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.646
But I thought I'd never
have to go back to that trailer.

06:33.646 --> 06:37.689
Well you don't have to Luanne,
not until you are good and ready.

06:37.943 --> 06:40.924
Did you know, I was the first of my
family to go to Beauty College.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.600
No I did not know that.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.097
And I'm not stopping there.

06:45.097 --> 06:49.786
I had dreams aunt Pegg,
I want to do hair make-ups for T.V.

06:50.282 --> 06:52.692
I know I'll be good.
I believe..

06:52.692 --> 06:56.399
that I could be the first one to hide those
bags under Michael Douglas's eyes.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.413
Those are big old dreams.

07:00.581 --> 07:03.863
I'm shooting for stars aunt Pegg,
and you know what?

07:04.228 --> 07:06.574
I'll be okay at Shiny Pines because,

07:06.975 --> 07:10.495
you can see the same stars over that
trailer you could see right here.

07:11.938 --> 07:13.127
Well at night!

07:13.761 --> 07:14.886
Peggy: Oaky doky!

07:14.886 --> 07:17.264
Well, you're all packed up now.

07:17.788 --> 07:19.421
Guess you better start your good buys.

07:20.806 --> 07:24.564
We want to get on the road before that
doctor Demento starts stinking up the airwaves.

07:26.498 --> 07:28.496
Mmm! good bye Ladybird.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.060
Oh! you look so sad,

07:31.647 --> 07:33.502
show me that smile now
come on!

07:35.392 --> 07:36.942
that's my girl!

07:37.846 --> 07:38.971
Bobby: Good bye Luanne.

07:38.971 --> 07:42.190
I just wanted you to know,
that I never read your dairy.

07:42.190 --> 07:46.912
even thou, you secretly suspected
I did, on June 18th 1985.

07:46.912 --> 07:49.021
That was wrong to doubt you Bobby.

07:49.587 --> 07:50.411
That's okay!

07:50.839 --> 07:52.789
Oh! uncle Hank,

07:53.106 --> 07:54.613
I just wanted to tell you,

07:54.613 --> 07:56.563
you've been like a father to me.

07:56.563 --> 08:00.968
Uh! and I just wanted
to tell you that a..

08:01.634 --> 08:02.363
Uh!

08:03.079 --> 08:04.872
here! let me give my card.

08:05.236 --> 08:10.055
Hold on to that, that will get you a 10%
discount on all your propane needs.

08:11.465 --> 08:13.241
Lucky. lucky me!

08:13.578 --> 08:16.559
Luanne honey, why don't you
go out and wait in the car.

08:19.539 --> 08:19.967
What!

08:20.685 --> 08:22.778
That card is just like cash.

08:23.111 --> 08:26.313
Did you even happen to notice that Luanne
was crying when she left here?

08:26.733 --> 08:30.364
Well, when isn't she crying?
she cries at weddings, she cries at..

08:30.364 --> 08:32.679
funerals, there's no rhyme or reason to it.

08:33.505 --> 08:36.755
I spent six hours tippin'up
her trailer yesterday.

08:37.152 --> 08:39.498
My back hurts, you don't see me cryin'.

08:39.498 --> 08:41.331
No I don't, but I wish I did.

08:41.743 --> 08:45.326
I mean, come on honey
a member of your family is saying goodbye.

08:45.643 --> 08:48.228
Luanne is not family, she's company.

08:48.574 --> 08:51.059
If she was family
I wouldn't have to double knot..

08:51.059 --> 08:54.231
the belt on my bath robe
just to get a mid-night snack.

08:54.698 --> 08:56.181
Well, that is your problem.

08:56.181 --> 08:59.504
Luanne loves you,
and you have no emotions for her at all?

08:59.783 --> 09:01.622
I've got plenty of emotions,

09:01.993 --> 09:04.086
I was afraid she was gonna hug me.

09:04.466 --> 09:08.271
I was worried that she wouldn't leave,
and I was happy when it was over.

09:08.271 --> 09:11.737
Well, I don't know how anyone
is supposed to know, what you're fellin',

09:11.737 --> 09:13.976
sitting there like...
like a block of wood?

09:14.828 --> 09:17.461
That is what you're sometimes,
a block-head.

09:17.727 --> 09:18.827
A block-head?!

09:19.143 --> 09:20.743
Now, that's hitin' below the belt!

09:20.743 --> 09:22.010
Well, I am sorry,

09:22.010 --> 09:25.289
but sometimes you make me wonder,
what the hell is wrong with you?

09:25.669 --> 09:26.366
Ow! really?

09:26.792 --> 09:28.215
Well speakin' of hell,

09:28.441 --> 09:30.890
if I wasn't so in control of my emotions,

09:30.890 --> 09:34.651
I might be inclined to say that's the sort
of place you should consider..

09:35.230 --> 09:38.220
- makin' a...a visit towards.
- Ooh!

09:40.845 --> 09:41.591
Mmhm!

09:42.160 --> 09:42.918
Mm..uhm!

09:46.088 --> 09:47.633
Mm..uhm!

09:50.012 --> 09:51.038
Uhmm!

09:52.441 --> 09:54.952
Son, I'm very sorry
you had to hear that.

09:55.422 --> 09:57.757
I just lost my grip, and..

09:57.974 --> 10:01.553
I spoke in a way, that a man
should never ever speak to his wife.

10:01.553 --> 10:03.117
I can't hear the T.V.

10:03.519 --> 10:08.173

10:12.237 --> 10:16.871
<i>Residents should be on the lookout for a tornado,

10:16.871 --> 10:20.692
<i>because as we all know Jim,
trailer parks can be hell in a tornado.</i>

10:21.113 --> 10:23.727
Hey! Isn't that funny dad,
'cause I mean..

10:23.727 --> 10:26.611
you sort of told
mom to go to hell, right!

10:26.611 --> 10:29.129
And then they say on T.V, that in a twister

10:29.129 --> 10:31.520
a trailer park is hell.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.638

10:47.895 --> 10:52.742
my tellin' your mother to go to hell,
will not be the last words the two of us exchange.

10:53.238 --> 10:57.183
You and I will just drive to the trailer park,
and pick-up Peggy and Luanne,

10:57.484 --> 10:59.004
and return without incident.

10:59.737 --> 11:03.095
Now just incase
I am incapacitated for some reason,

11:03.334 --> 11:06.675
do you know how to start
a man's heart with a downed power line?

11:06.979 --> 11:07.600
No.

11:08.249 --> 11:11.037
Well!
There's really no wrong way to do it.

11:11.037 --> 11:15.259
I...I wish I could,
hang around with you ordinary citizen types,

11:15.259 --> 11:17.043
but my county needs me.

11:17.508 --> 11:23.001
Yep! I take on certain powers,
when I put on this uniform. Not unlike..

Stretch Armstrong, Spiderman an' what not.

11:28.066 --> 11:30.048

I...I don't mine you guys making fun
of me on a daily basis but,

11:39.818 --> 11:42.964
when I have this uniform on
I'd appreciate little respect.

11:43.456 --> 11:47.892
I'm sorry, you're right, of all the army
barbers I know you're the bravest.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.791
Set you're moose on stun there Bill.

11:54.711 --> 12:00.104
You better hang on to that camcorder real good
'cause I'm driving right up next to that twister.

12:00.104 --> 12:04.246
Hard Copies payin'
500 bucks for flying cow video.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.423
I tell you what man, when..we have flyin'..

12:06.423 --> 12:10.244
cow man you gonna..go blow that up
damn dynamite an' ol can like that

12:10.244 --> 12:13.121
would have..boom..man an all cat 'an
cow's flyin' all over the place.

12:13.335 --> 12:16.436
This is no time for jokes Boomhauer.

12:16.436 --> 12:20.987
This tornado is already classified
at level-2 on the Fujusaki scale.

12:20.987 --> 12:24.276
Well a storm that strong will send an egg through a barn door

12:24.550 --> 12:26.579
Two barn doors if one of 'em is open.

12:26.944 --> 12:29.322
What will a level 3 do mr. Gribble?

12:29.322 --> 12:32.890
Level 3 will send an egg through a brick wall.

12:33.184 --> 12:36.228
Tornado chasers call it, Humpty's revenge.

12:36.481 --> 12:37.344
Waoh!

12:37.589 --> 12:40.214
Tornado time is like the End of Day's Bobby.

12:40.531 --> 12:41.382
" Soft shall be..

12:41.382 --> 12:42.771
blasted through the hard

12:43.037 --> 12:44.407
chaos will descend upon

12:44.407 --> 12:45.559
the well organized.

12:45.559 --> 12:49.973
And the strongest of men will become
like a woman of average strength."

12:50.460 --> 12:53.430
That's enough there Dale.
Now let's go Bobby.

12:53.837 --> 12:57.901
Uh! just a minute dad,
I...I forgot somethin' important.

13:01.929 --> 13:02.860
Mmmhm!

13:03.652 --> 13:06.543
Nancy Hicks Gribble here
for Tornado Watch 97,

13:06.543 --> 13:08.424
brought to you by
Mega 'lo Mart.

13:08.825 --> 13:11.419
mention that your home
was destroyed, and get a free..

13:11.419 --> 13:13.439
5 lb. bag of onions.

13:14.062 --> 13:16.449
A series of tornado
has touched down in Arlene county.

13:16.449 --> 13:20.210
As of this time we have no reports of injuries
or injury footage,

13:20.210 --> 13:23.546
but if you know of someone,
who has been injured or is likely to be injured,

13:23.546 --> 13:24.731
please call this station.

13:42.563 --> 13:44.629
So many bad memories.

13:45.309 --> 13:47.668
there's the fork mamma stabbed daddy with.

13:48.365 --> 13:51.343
Oh!
And empty bottles from that awful night.

13:51.343 --> 13:52.774
And..oh no!

13:53.460 --> 13:57.160
Those mango colored palazzo pants
that made my part look beige.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.777
Oh! this is very harder than I thought.

14:00.586 --> 14:04.408
Ooh! there was a lot of fighting
going on when we lived here.

14:05.041 --> 14:07.140
I guess, I have that affect on people.

14:07.663 --> 14:09.403
No. Do not be silly.

14:09.403 --> 14:12.472
The fight, Hank and I had today
was about him, not you.

14:12.996 --> 14:15.889
I am so mad at him,
and his precious self control.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.778
<i>Imitates Hank: I surely am not fond of you Peggy,</i>

14:19.059 --> 14:20.175
<i>I tell you what?!</i>

14:20.491 --> 14:22.554
Ugh!
What kind of marriage proposal is that?

14:26.063 --> 14:28.932
<i>Wizzy's night club was in the path of gale force winds</i>

14:28.932 --> 14:29.387
<i>Wizzy.</i>

14:29.868 --> 14:31.230
<i>It leveled the club now,</i>

14:31.479 --> 14:35.905
<i>the strippers are fine, but a customer
had his lap broken by one of the dancer's.</i>

14:37.192 --> 14:38.242
Nothin' to worry about.

14:38.889 --> 14:42.354
That trailer park is at least
three strip clubs away from Wizzy's.

14:44.025 --> 14:44.427
What?!

14:45.788 --> 14:46.129
Ooh!

14:49.331 --> 14:51.497
It's that dang fuel filter again.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.678
There's no gas station for miles.

14:55.374 --> 14:56.530
Go to the Mega 'Lo Mart.

14:56.942 --> 14:59.128
They've got everything and a whole lot more.

14:59.544 --> 15:03.615
So maybe, just maybe,
they'll have fruit pies.

15:04.882 --> 15:06.060
Come on Bobby hurry up!

15:10.204 --> 15:11.376
Dale: Alright twister,

15:11.725 --> 15:13.266
it's just you and me now.

15:13.630 --> 15:15.911
Ten years ago you took my shirt.

15:16.192 --> 15:19.313
Did you think I'd forget that,
come on, bring it on.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.759
God! No please let me go!

15:24.502 --> 15:25.975
Wow!
an' dang 'ol wow! hey!

15:33.906 --> 15:35.474
Hank: Excuse me! come on Bobby.

15:43.052 --> 15:45.618
Twelve fuel filters for $60.

15:45.618 --> 15:47.044
But I only need one.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.859
One fuel filter.

15:52.128 --> 15:55.265
I'm sorry hun, but those have to be
purchased in packets of twelve.

15:57.756 --> 15:58.976
Twelve fuel filters.

15:59.309 --> 16:02.034
I'm sorry sweet heart, I can't sell you
a packet since it's opened.

16:02.414 --> 16:03.380
I opened it.

16:03.634 --> 16:05.059
I'm the one who opened it.

16:05.319 --> 16:08.196
I'm sorry baby but I can't...
for insurance...reasons.

16:08.554 --> 16:13.104
What insurance reason? what could possibly
happen with an open package of fuel filters?

16:13.104 --> 16:14.125
Fuel filters!

16:14.125 --> 16:17.586
Honey, quick!
that jackass is buying all the fuel filters.

16:17.586 --> 16:18.077
What?!

16:18.077 --> 16:19.661
Leave some for us jackass!

16:19.661 --> 16:22.589
I need a fuel filter, what are they for?
I need one.

16:22.589 --> 16:24.344
Well, that man's buyin' by the dozen.

16:24.344 --> 16:25.362
Somebody stop him!

16:34.137 --> 16:35.040
Hank: Come on!

16:39.659 --> 16:44.469
Come on let's go!
move that truck my wife is stuck in Shiny Pines.

16:44.846 --> 16:46.734
I'm not authorized to drive the truck sir!

16:47.383 --> 16:51.472
My wife is in danger damn'it!
Now make somethin' happen.

16:52.544 --> 16:53.529
Security!

16:54.080 --> 16:57.026
Bill! thank god!
make this idiot let me pass.

16:57.381 --> 17:01.531
I'm just...how'd I do that Hank,
with my blow drier and my scissors an' comb.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.063
Bill, come on now!

17:03.421 --> 17:04.204
No, I'm sorry.

17:04.204 --> 17:06.009
I...I must have a bad case of...

17:06.009 --> 17:10.922
barbers' ear, I can't hear a word you say
until you address me as stg. Dougtrive.

17:10.922 --> 17:12.087
Bill please!

17:12.329 --> 17:14.867
I can't hear you.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.477
Alright! stg. Dougtrive.

17:17.477 --> 17:22.454
Bill: I don't know if I like your tone privet.
Hank: Oh! what did I do to deserve this?

17:22.859 --> 17:25.019
I didn't mean to curse my wife to hell.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.600
Aaaaaaagh!

17:34.600 --> 17:35.967
Noooo!

17:44.163 --> 17:46.658
Nancy Gribble here foe Death Watch '97.

17:46.927 --> 17:50.151
A level 5 tornado is headed
straight for Shiny Pines trailer park.

17:50.666 --> 17:53.696
Shiny Pines residence,
we urge you to remain calm.

17:54.117 --> 17:57.523
However, if there are any personal issues
that you've been waiting to resolve,

17:57.523 --> 18:00.517
or, if you've never experienced
the miracle of love making.

18:01.072 --> 18:02.461
Now might be the time.

18:06.455 --> 18:07.002
Peggy!

18:07.293 --> 18:08.824
Luanne, where are you?!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.598
Look dad! flamingo.

18:11.616 --> 18:15.291
The twister's coming, run for the ....hole.

18:15.670 --> 18:16.824
Take my son!

18:18.180 --> 18:18.864
Peggy!

18:20.423 --> 18:21.564
Peggy are you in here?!

18:22.033 --> 18:24.048
Peggy: Hank over here!

18:24.352 --> 18:24.884
Peggy!

18:27.436 --> 18:29.844
This is the moment I've been waitin' for.

18:34.176 --> 18:35.785
Aagh!...ah!

18:36.064 --> 18:36.863
Look-out!

18:38.954 --> 18:39.638
Hurry Hank!

18:44.014 --> 18:45.826
Luanne: Hang on uncle Hank!

18:46.210 --> 18:48.124
Peggy: What on earth are you doing here?

18:48.124 --> 18:50.202
Hank: I came to find YOU.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.406
I don't know how long I can hold on,

18:53.777 --> 18:58.738
so I better say this now.
I feel terrible about what I said to you Peggy,

18:59.207 --> 19:01.251
I don't want you to go to hell!

19:01.593 --> 19:01.986
I just...

19:02.468 --> 19:02.734
...I

19:02.974 --> 19:03.684
I mean..I

19:04.483 --> 19:06.827
I'm not good at this kind of thing.

19:07.108 --> 19:09.706
Go on, you're doing fine sweetheart!

19:10.162 --> 19:11.534
Don't edit yourself,

19:11.939 --> 19:14.677
just whatever comes,
just let it come!

19:15.011 --> 19:16.633
[Yelling] You're my best girl,

19:17.005 --> 19:19.218
you...you mean everything to me,

19:19.663 --> 19:21.462
when we were apart today,

19:21.664 --> 19:22.793
that was Hell.

19:23.065 --> 19:25.269
I couldn't wake up in the morning, without....

19:25.269 --> 19:27.937
your beautiful face beside me.

19:29.047 --> 19:30.383
I love you.

19:30.947 --> 19:31.693
And Bobby,

19:32.419 --> 19:33.516
And Luanne.

19:34.142 --> 19:36.020
To...a...lesser.....extent.

19:36.768 --> 19:37.499
Ow!

19:39.342 --> 19:40.355
Hang on!

19:40.699 --> 19:42.481
Aaaaaaaa!

20:03.283 --> 20:08.605
Hurry! Hank hurry! it's the eye of the storm,
come to the shelter. R..U..N.

20:09.234 --> 20:12.088
Uh! Is Luanne still alive?

20:13.549 --> 20:15.001
Tell her to cover her eyes.

20:15.411 --> 20:16.368
They're covered.

20:16.622 --> 20:18.539
Oh! just run you jackass.

20:19.063 --> 20:21.695
Don't tell me that old lady's in there too.

20:21.923 --> 20:24.910
Oh! don't mind me, I've seen a barrel
of peoples in my day.

20:26.365 --> 20:27.542
Alright I'm comin'.

20:29.131 --> 20:29.864
Mmm!

20:30.676 --> 20:31.408
Hmmm!

21:00.406 --> 21:03.595
Well, you don't have
a trailer anymore. It's tipped over.

21:04.273 --> 21:06.649
Guess, you'll be staying with us from now on.

21:07.263 --> 21:08.352
Thanks uncle Hank!

21:14.195 --> 21:15.660
You know, what I'll never forget..

21:16.274 --> 21:17.997
was when uncle Hank was naked.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.670
That never happened.

21:21.225 --> 21:22.987
But, the wind blew all his clothes off.

21:23.344 --> 21:24.353
Not my underwear.

21:24.353 --> 21:25.214
Yes it did!

21:25.528 --> 21:27.120
NOT MY UNDERWEAR.

21:27.606 --> 21:29.148
Not...his...underwear.

22:10.115 --> 22:12.761
I can't H...E...A...R
Y...O....U.
