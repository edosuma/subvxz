WEBVTT

00:03.865 --> 00:05.064
<i>Sorry, Nigel.</i>

00:05.065 --> 00:06.850
Dinner took longer
than I thought.

00:10.421 --> 00:14.023
And now we are stuck in traffic.

00:14.025 --> 00:15.992
Yeah, bumper to bumper.

00:15.994 --> 00:18.995
Well, tell Ava I'll be there
in an hour, okay?

00:18.997 --> 00:20.413
Okay.

00:21.832 --> 00:23.666
Why didn't you
just tell him the truth?

00:23.668 --> 00:26.235
Because I know
my ex-husband quite well,

00:26.237 --> 00:28.905
and it would really upset him
if he found out

00:28.907 --> 00:31.424
you flew me to San Francisco
in your private jet

00:31.426 --> 00:33.877
just to have fried clams.

00:33.879 --> 00:34.928
Yeah, you're right.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.012
You shouldn't tell him.

00:36.014 --> 00:36.713
Thank you.

00:36.715 --> 00:37.547
I'll tell him.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.016
I just wanted to do
something nice for you

00:40.018 --> 00:41.083
before you went to London.

00:41.085 --> 00:43.052
I'll only be gone a few weeks.

00:43.054 --> 00:45.254
And I...

00:45.256 --> 00:47.106
will miss you.

00:47.108 --> 00:50.059
And I will miss you.

00:51.029 --> 00:52.195
Whoa.
What was that?

00:53.365 --> 00:55.215
Don't worry, it's normal.

00:58.153 --> 00:59.702
Ahh! That's not normal!

00:59.704 --> 01:01.270
God, oh, God, oh, God!

01:01.272 --> 01:03.122
Zoey, I love you.

01:03.124 --> 01:04.541
I don't want to die.

01:04.543 --> 01:06.242
Did you hear me?
I said I love you.

01:06.244 --> 01:08.912
I heard you,
and I said I don't want to die.

01:22.344 --> 01:24.060
Just some clear air turbulence.

01:24.062 --> 01:26.295
Should be smooth sailing
from here on out.

Aw...

02:05.839 --> 02:09.056
What's sadder than
an empty bottle of wine?

02:09.059 --> 02:13.261
Being the boyfriend of
a 40-year-old drunk soccer mom.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.596
What?

02:14.598 --> 02:15.814
Oh, I was just thinking

02:15.816 --> 02:17.399
you might want
to slow down a little.

02:17.401 --> 02:19.884
It's only wine, geez.

02:19.886 --> 02:22.821
It's only been wine
since last July.

02:22.823 --> 02:24.773
Hey, hey, that got
a three-star rating

02:24.775 --> 02:26.391
in the Wal-Mart wine tracker.

02:26.393 --> 02:28.310
What's the big deal?

02:28.312 --> 02:30.445
So, I need a few glasses
to loosen me up.

02:30.447 --> 02:31.830
Are you saying you
need to get loaded

02:31.832 --> 02:32.914
in order to have sex with me?

02:32.916 --> 02:35.283
I'm not loaded.
Fine.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.352
But it doesn't hurt.

02:38.454 --> 02:40.121
Hey, guys.

02:40.123 --> 02:42.073
Wally! Want some wine?

02:42.075 --> 02:44.459
No, I don't like to drink
when I'm depressed.

02:44.461 --> 02:46.261
Wally, it's the best time
to drink.

02:46.263 --> 02:49.264
Also when you're bored, lonely,
or just, you know,

02:49.266 --> 02:50.565
too sober.

02:51.417 --> 02:52.884
Why are you depressed?

02:52.886 --> 02:54.135
I don't know.

02:54.137 --> 02:55.470
It's kind of personal.

02:55.472 --> 02:57.689
Okay, no problem.

02:59.058 --> 03:00.275
What do you do when you

03:00.277 --> 03:02.193
tell someone you love them
and they don't respond?

03:02.195 --> 03:04.946
Drink.

03:04.948 --> 03:06.898
Wait, you told Zoey
you love her?

03:06.900 --> 03:08.483
Yeah, I thought the plane
was gonna crash,

03:08.485 --> 03:09.818
and it just kind of came out,

03:09.820 --> 03:12.671
along with a little squirt
of pee.

03:13.489 --> 03:15.540
So, what did she say?

03:15.542 --> 03:19.944
"Oh, God,
oh, God, I don't want to die."

03:19.946 --> 03:22.964
Well, given the circumstance,
that's a legitimate response.

03:22.966 --> 03:24.082
Sure, in the moment,

03:24.084 --> 03:25.634
but what about
after the plane leveled out?

03:25.636 --> 03:26.584
Well, what did she say then?

03:26.586 --> 03:29.421
"Why do I smell pee?"

03:32.558 --> 03:34.426
Then we just sat there
in silence

03:34.428 --> 03:36.094
for the rest of the flight.

03:36.096 --> 03:38.113
Should have drank.

03:39.965 --> 03:42.767
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go
change my underwear

03:42.769 --> 03:44.185
before I get diaper rash.

03:45.971 --> 03:48.323
Wow, I feel bad for him.

03:48.325 --> 03:49.741
Yeah.

03:49.743 --> 03:51.809
I mean, you know, to tell
somebody you love them,

03:51.811 --> 03:54.079
and just get no response.

03:54.081 --> 03:56.097
Awful.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.852
You know how I feel
about you, right?

04:00.854 --> 04:01.986
Right.

04:01.988 --> 04:03.705
You know how I
feel about you.

04:03.707 --> 04:06.708
Oh, absolutely.

04:09.962 --> 04:12.030
Still nice to hear
on occasion.

04:12.032 --> 04:14.182
Oh, I agree.

04:17.153 --> 04:21.272
I can do this
as long as you can, pal.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.729
It's open.

04:27.731 --> 04:29.447
Hey.

04:29.449 --> 04:30.782
Can I talk to you for a minute?

04:30.784 --> 04:32.067
Sure. What's up?

04:33.686 --> 04:35.870
I didn't sleep at all
last night, man.

04:35.872 --> 04:37.856
This Zoey stuff
is making me crazy.

04:37.858 --> 04:39.357
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

04:39.359 --> 04:41.793
I'm starting to wonder

04:41.795 --> 04:44.379
if I should break
up with her,

04:44.381 --> 04:46.364
Oh, hang on. I mean,
just because she didn't say,

04:46.366 --> 04:48.299
"I love you," doesn't mean
she doesn't feel it.

04:48.301 --> 04:49.634
You think?

04:49.636 --> 04:51.536
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Some people have a hard time

04:51.538 --> 04:52.504
articulating their feelings,

04:52.506 --> 04:54.756
so they express them
in other ways.

04:59.128 --> 05:00.044
Is that Lyndsey?

05:01.181 --> 05:03.765
Yeah, she had a little
too much vino last night.

05:03.767 --> 05:06.768
Anyway, I think you just have
to be patient with Zoey.

05:08.905 --> 05:11.222
Yeah, I guess.

05:15.411 --> 05:18.729
Sorry, I... I have a...
a hard time with...

05:18.731 --> 05:20.582
people throwing up.

05:20.584 --> 05:23.251
Try watching
and holding her hair.

05:23.253 --> 05:26.404
It's just, Zoey's going
to England for a few weeks.

05:29.842 --> 05:31.426
And-and I'm th...

05:32.628 --> 05:34.763
I'm-I'm starting to
think if...

05:34.765 --> 05:37.582
if I'm gonna end it,
now would be a good time.

05:37.584 --> 05:39.768
Well, it...

05:42.388 --> 05:43.688
Whoa.

05:43.690 --> 05:45.607
You think I'd be
used to it by now.

05:45.609 --> 05:47.258
No, no, no, don't...

05:47.260 --> 05:48.526
Don't do anything hasty.

05:51.814 --> 05:54.816
I can't... I... I can't
just leave th...

05:54.818 --> 05:57.318
I can't just leave things
the way that they are.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.038
Why don't you...
Why don't you go talk to her,

06:00.040 --> 06:03.041
you know, and just put
your caaards on the table.

06:05.110 --> 06:07.045
Yeah, maybe.

06:07.047 --> 06:08.446
Crap,

06:08.448 --> 06:10.482
now I've got to change my bra.

06:13.586 --> 06:16.221
I-I-I mean, maybe we should
just give her some privacy.

06:16.223 --> 06:20.775
Oh, God,
now it's coming out both ends!

06:20.777 --> 06:23.061
Good idea.

06:27.850 --> 06:29.767
Ava, you need
to get dressed.

06:29.769 --> 06:31.936
Mummy has to go.

06:34.156 --> 06:35.523
Walden.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.941
De-e-lightful.

06:36.943 --> 06:40.912
Nigel, di-isgusting.

06:42.915 --> 06:44.482
What, are you here
to pick up your daughter?

06:44.484 --> 06:45.834
I am.

06:45.836 --> 06:48.203
Zoey tell you that we took
my jet to San Francisco

06:48.205 --> 06:50.038
last night for fried clams?

06:50.040 --> 06:52.674
No, she did not.

06:52.676 --> 06:54.926
Well, we did.

06:54.928 --> 06:57.595
Are you sharing this information
just to upset me?

06:57.597 --> 07:01.499
Actually, I was hoping to make
you feel inadequate as well.

07:01.501 --> 07:02.600
Oh, Walden.

07:02.602 --> 07:04.035
What are you
doing here?

07:04.037 --> 07:05.436
Nigel, I'm running late,

07:05.438 --> 07:07.138
so will you for once please
make yourself useful

07:07.140 --> 07:08.356
and help Ava get ready?

07:08.358 --> 07:11.359
Well, only because
you asked so nicely.

07:11.361 --> 07:12.694
Enjoy her.

07:12.696 --> 07:13.978
Hi.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.029
We need to talk.

07:15.031 --> 07:17.115
Now? I'm about to leave
for the airport.

07:17.117 --> 07:18.149
I'll take you.

07:18.151 --> 07:19.951
Thanks, but I have a car coming.

07:19.953 --> 07:21.202
Now, where is my passport?

07:21.204 --> 07:22.787
Nigel, have you
seen my passport?

07:22.789 --> 07:24.072
I don't live
here, Zoey,

07:24.074 --> 07:26.040
I merely
pay the rent.

07:26.042 --> 07:28.126
Look, I just don't want
to leave things between us

07:28.128 --> 07:29.210
the way that they are.

07:29.212 --> 07:30.161
Everything's fine.

07:30.163 --> 07:31.379
No, it's not.

07:31.381 --> 07:32.863
I said I love you,
and the only thing

07:32.865 --> 07:35.750
I got in response is the not
very surprising information

07:35.752 --> 07:37.868
that you don't want to die
in a crashing plane.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.804
Can't we discuss this
when I get back?

07:39.806 --> 07:40.755
What's there to discuss?

07:40.757 --> 07:43.708
You either love me,
or you don't.

07:43.710 --> 07:46.561
Walden, I'm about to leave
on an important business trip,

07:46.563 --> 07:48.963
and the last thing I need
right now is more pressure.

07:48.965 --> 07:50.181
I'm not pressuring you.

07:50.183 --> 07:52.216
I'm just asking you for a
simple, definitive answer

07:52.218 --> 07:53.601
right now before you leave.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.353
What was that?

07:55.355 --> 07:57.888
Sorry, just knocked over
your Chinese table lamp.

07:57.890 --> 07:59.290
Perhaps you can
buy another one

07:59.292 --> 08:01.609
next time you jet
to Francisco.

08:03.162 --> 08:04.562
It came up.

08:04.564 --> 08:08.116
I'm sorry, I just don't have
the time for this now, okay?

08:08.118 --> 08:10.084
Ava, are you dressed?

08:11.870 --> 08:14.839
That seems pretty
definitive to me.

08:17.576 --> 08:18.743
That's it.

08:18.745 --> 08:20.795
No more relationships.
I'm done.

08:20.797 --> 08:22.130
Finished; just over.

08:27.803 --> 08:29.137
Hi.

08:29.139 --> 08:31.022

Hey, can I have 75 bucks

08:49.397 --> 08:51.490
$75 for a video game?

08:51.492 --> 08:53.609
Think of it as an investment.

08:56.212 --> 08:57.963
An investment?

08:57.965 --> 09:00.215
Yeah. If I go into the
army after high school,

09:00.217 --> 09:03.168
I'll already know how
to kill terrorists.

09:04.337 --> 09:07.122
Who had corn chowder
for dinner last night?

09:07.124 --> 09:09.391
How do you know anybody
had corn chowder last night?

09:09.393 --> 09:11.480
'Cause it's dripping
all over your bathroom.

09:11.505 --> 09:12.705
Oh.

09:12.963 --> 09:14.012
Sorry about that.

Uh, Lyndsey got a little bit...

09:16.467 --> 09:18.067
queasy this morning.

09:18.069 --> 09:19.151
Is she pregnant?

09:19.153 --> 09:21.353
Oh, no, no, gosh, no.

09:22.773 --> 09:24.473
Absolutely not.

09:25.859 --> 09:27.693
Here.

09:27.695 --> 09:28.777
Me?

09:28.779 --> 09:30.529
Not my girlfriend,
not my vomit,

09:30.531 --> 09:31.997
not my problem.

09:33.333 --> 09:34.333
I'll clean it up.

09:34.335 --> 09:35.150
You will?

09:35.152 --> 09:36.585
For 75 bucks.

09:36.587 --> 09:38.370
That's great.

09:38.372 --> 09:40.706
Hey, everybody.

09:42.658 --> 09:44.710
This is Jennifer.
Hi.

- Hey.
- Hey.

09:48.548 --> 09:50.265
Well, let's go take
a walk on the beach.

09:50.267 --> 09:51.383
Great.

09:51.385 --> 09:52.501
Uh, Walden,
before you go,

09:52.503 --> 09:55.053
can I talk to you
for a minute?

09:59.726 --> 10:01.009
I'll bring him right back.

10:01.011 --> 10:02.444
You'd better.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.848
My name's Jake.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.367
Hi, Jake.

10:08.369 --> 10:11.870
My friends call me... Jake.

10:14.207 --> 10:15.574
What are you doing?

10:15.576 --> 10:16.875
Zoey made it perfectly clear.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.494
She doesn't love me or need me.

10:18.496 --> 10:19.878
So, I'm moving on.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.197
You left here an hour ago.

10:22.199 --> 10:24.049
How did you find
another girl already?

10:24.051 --> 10:25.534
Oh, I met her in the elevator.

10:25.536 --> 10:26.885
I've been in
a million elevators.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.338
I never once walked out
with a girl like that.

10:29.340 --> 10:31.256
Maybe you need to work
on your attitude.

10:31.258 --> 10:34.059
What exactly did Zoey say?

10:34.061 --> 10:35.561
No, it's what she <i>didn't</i> say.

10:35.563 --> 10:37.262
She didn't say, "I love you."

10:37.264 --> 10:40.349
Oh, please! If I insisted on
women saying "I love you""

10:40.351 --> 10:43.535
I'd have never have had a
girlfriend, a wife or a mother.

10:46.990 --> 10:49.575
Oh. It's Zoey.

10:51.861 --> 10:53.895
Hello?

10:53.897 --> 10:56.398
So, Jennifer,
how old are you?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.200
24. How old are you?

10:58.202 --> 11:00.285
I'm... 24-and-a-half.

11:00.287 --> 11:02.404
Hmm.

11:07.594 --> 11:09.761
Hmm?

11:10.547 --> 11:12.381
I'm surprised
that you called.

11:12.383 --> 11:13.599
Where are you?

11:13.601 --> 11:14.933
On the plane.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.051
We're sitting at the gate.

11:16.053 --> 11:17.636
- Are you okay?
- No.

11:17.638 --> 11:20.138
I feel miserable
about the way we left things.

11:20.140 --> 11:22.140
- You do?
- Yeah.

11:22.142 --> 11:24.259
I've just been so stressed
and busy lately

11:24.261 --> 11:26.395
that I haven't been able
to think straight.

11:26.397 --> 11:29.431
But sitting here
for the last 40 minutes

11:29.433 --> 11:33.268
without so much
as a bloody glass of water,

11:33.270 --> 11:35.604
I've come to a realization.

11:35.606 --> 11:37.039
I'm listening.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.124
The reason I haven't said...

11:39.126 --> 11:41.126
those words to you

11:41.128 --> 11:43.078
is because I'm afraid

11:43.080 --> 11:46.381
that if I do say them,
something bad will happen.

11:46.383 --> 11:47.833
Why would you think that?

11:47.835 --> 11:49.718
'Cause it always has.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.637
I've only said
those words twice.

11:51.639 --> 11:53.788
The last time,
I ended up married

11:53.790 --> 11:56.975
to an insufferable twit.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.126
And the time before that?

11:58.128 --> 11:59.695
I got a thank-you note

11:59.697 --> 12:02.764
and a Swatch watch
from Russell Brand.

12:02.766 --> 12:04.399
Russell Brand?

12:04.401 --> 12:07.152
Mm, not my proudest moment.

12:07.154 --> 12:08.654
Okay. I get it.

12:08.656 --> 12:10.138
So, you're just superstitious
about saying it,

12:10.140 --> 12:13.191
but it has nothing to do with
the way that you feel about me?

12:13.193 --> 12:15.777
No. Not at all.

12:15.779 --> 12:18.146
In fact, the whole reason
I called is

12:18.148 --> 12:19.748
to tell you that I honestly
I...

12:19.750 --> 12:21.250
Oh, there you are.

12:21.252 --> 12:24.953
Ooh! Cool bedroom.

12:24.955 --> 12:25.837
Who's that?

12:25.839 --> 12:29.007
Uh... Berta.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.843
You couldn't even wait
till my plane takes off?!

12:31.845 --> 12:33.962
No, no, Zoey, it's not what you think!
Oh, good-bye, Walden.

12:33.964 --> 12:36.298
Zoey, just...

12:37.600 --> 12:40.185
♪ Awkward!

12:49.512 --> 12:53.448
Oh... I can't believe I kissed
the mouth that did this.

12:54.984 --> 12:57.686
Alan, I need to
talk to you. Oh!

12:59.038 --> 13:00.689
Can we do it out here?

13:00.691 --> 13:02.291
Gladly.

13:02.293 --> 13:03.709
Oh, good Lord!

13:03.711 --> 13:06.712
Looks like someone
cleaned a deer in the bathtub.

13:09.048 --> 13:10.248
What's going on?

13:10.250 --> 13:11.700
Zoey FaceTimed me
from the plane

13:11.702 --> 13:13.218
to tell me that she loves me.

13:13.220 --> 13:13.740
Good.

13:13.765 --> 13:15.295
But she saw Jennifer
in my bedroom.

13:15.296 --> 13:15.976
Bad.

13:16.001 --> 13:17.836
So, naturally, I immediately
tried to call her back.

13:17.841 --> 13:19.341
Good.
But she wouldn't answer.

13:19.343 --> 13:20.759
Bad.
So I'm gonna fuel up my jet,

13:20.761 --> 13:22.227
and fly to London
and beg for forgiveness.

13:22.229 --> 13:24.730
Good.
Will you stop that, Alan?

13:24.732 --> 13:26.898
I-I need you to come with me.
Me? Why?

13:26.900 --> 13:28.684
Because I might need a witness,
and you can say

13:28.686 --> 13:30.152
that you saw that
nothing happened with Jennifer.

13:30.154 --> 13:31.570
Great. I'm your man.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.907
I am not gonna touch that glove.

13:36.892 --> 13:37.909
Come on.

13:37.911 --> 13:39.161
Oh, uh, wait.

13:39.163 --> 13:40.779
I promised Lyndsey
I'd take her out

13:40.781 --> 13:42.280
to a big, fancy,
romantic dinner tonight.

13:42.282 --> 13:43.415
Bring her.
Really?

13:43.417 --> 13:44.232
Yeah, sure.

13:44.234 --> 13:45.400
Well, I guess a private jet

13:45.402 --> 13:46.501
to London does beat

13:46.503 --> 13:48.453
an 11-year-old Volvo
to the Olive Garden.

13:48.455 --> 13:49.871
I'll-I'll pack a bag.

13:49.873 --> 13:51.006
No, no, no, there's no time.

13:51.008 --> 13:52.374
I'll buy you whatever you need
in London.

13:52.376 --> 13:53.842
You're kidding.
Yeah. Come on.

13:53.844 --> 13:55.844
Hey, if Zoey won't say it,
I will.

13:55.846 --> 13:58.079
I love you, Walden Schmidt.

14:08.091 --> 14:09.691
Thank you, Walden.

14:09.693 --> 14:11.610
This is just incredible.

14:11.612 --> 14:13.228
Glad you like it.
Mm.

14:13.230 --> 14:15.197
What did your son say
when you told him

14:15.199 --> 14:16.448
you were flying
to London tonight?

14:16.450 --> 14:19.384
He told me to bring him back
some English pot.

14:20.820 --> 14:24.039
This is definitely
the way to travel.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.441
No boarding passes,
no airport security,

14:26.443 --> 14:27.743
none of those scanners

14:27.745 --> 14:29.795
that show strangers
the size of your dingle.

14:29.797 --> 14:33.298
Don't you worry about
your dingle, honey.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.751
He's a grower, not a shower.

14:35.753 --> 14:36.951
Yeah, he told me.

14:36.953 --> 14:38.887
He tells everyone.

14:44.877 --> 14:47.212
Can I interest
you in a brewski?

14:48.247 --> 14:49.247
What?

14:49.249 --> 14:50.315
That's Polish for

14:50.317 --> 14:52.601
"Do you want a beer?"

14:52.603 --> 14:54.903
I've traveled
extensively through Asia.

14:56.406 --> 14:58.607
Oh. Thanks.

15:00.643 --> 15:02.994
Are you sure Walden said
he'd be right back?

15:02.996 --> 15:04.496
Forget Walden.

15:04.498 --> 15:06.147
Let's talk about us.

15:06.149 --> 15:07.416
Us?

15:07.418 --> 15:09.468
That's English
for you and me.

Pish, pish, party pooper.

15:27.504 --> 15:32.023
Wally, this is so romantic
what you're doing.

15:32.025 --> 15:35.393
You are flying
across a whole ocean

15:35.395 --> 15:38.063
just to win back
the woman you love.

15:38.065 --> 15:40.315
Thank you.

15:40.317 --> 15:43.618
Alan, sweetie,
I need to tell you something.

15:43.620 --> 15:44.853
Yeah?

15:44.855 --> 15:46.905
I know I give you a hard time,

I really, really

16:31.285 --> 16:33.418
Bottom line, Zoey,
I can assure you

16:33.420 --> 16:36.087
that nothing happened
between Walden and that woman.

16:36.089 --> 16:37.255
Really?

16:37.257 --> 16:39.508
What possible reason
would I have to lie to you?

16:39.510 --> 16:40.742
Well, for one thing, he gave

16:40.744 --> 16:42.577
you and Lyndsey a
free trip to London,

16:42.579 --> 16:44.212
where you all
inexplicably decided

16:44.214 --> 16:46.498
to dress up
like Japanese tourists.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.050
That's my fault.

16:49.052 --> 16:51.102
I kind of threw up
on them a little.

16:51.104 --> 16:53.388
A little?
I might have to get a new plane.

16:53.390 --> 16:56.274

all very interesting,

16:56.276 --> 16:57.425

16:57.427 --> 16:59.227
that you still invited
my neighbor Jennifer--

16:59.229 --> 17:00.695
the whore
from the seventh floor--

17:00.697 --> 17:01.813
back to your house.

17:01.815 --> 17:03.565
Yeah, but nothing happened.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.367
Nothing happened 'cause
I called and interrupted you!

17:06.369 --> 17:09.954
Okay, I think we're saying
the same thing here.

17:09.957 --> 17:11.772

17:11.775 --> 17:14.376
Okay, and I was an idiot
to put pressure on you,

17:14.377 --> 17:19.181

you forgive me?

Well, that depends.

17:51.915 --> 17:54.532
Do I have to worry every time
we have a fight

17:54.534 --> 17:57.168
that you're going to go out
and pick up another woman?
