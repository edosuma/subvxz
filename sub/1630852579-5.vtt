WEBVTT

00:01.918 --> 00:04.837
NARRATOR: It is the most highly
coveted lost relic in the world.

00:04.921 --> 00:06.413
KATHLEEN McGOWAN COPPENS:
The Ark of the Covenant

00:06.497 --> 00:08.081
is without question
the most significant

00:08.166 --> 00:10.009
and powerful artifact
in human history.

00:10.093 --> 00:13.762
NARRATOR: It was a
weapon of extraordinary power.

00:13.921 --> 00:17.841
ANDREW COLLINS: It was
said to smite the enemies of Israel.

00:17.925 --> 00:20.677
It was said
to bring about disease.

00:20.762 --> 00:25.849
It was said to bring down
the walls of Jericho.

00:25.942 --> 00:31.104
NARRATOR: And it provided direct
communication with the heavens.

00:31.189 --> 00:32.948
WILLIAM HENRY: It was
the only physical manifestation

00:33.033 --> 00:36.109
of God on Earth.

00:36.194 --> 00:39.204
NARRATOR: But what happened
to the Ark of the Covenant?

00:39.363 --> 00:41.281
AMIR HUSSAIN:
There's all sorts of stories.

00:41.365 --> 00:42.791
Is it buried somewhere?

00:42.876 --> 00:45.544
Was it looted? Was it stolen?

00:45.628 --> 00:47.129
NARRATOR:
There are those who believe

00:47.213 --> 00:49.048
that if the Ark is ever found,

00:49.132 --> 00:54.044
it will provide undeniable proof
of extraterrestrial visitation.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.213
NICK POPE:
The Ark of the Covenant

00:56.297 --> 00:59.892
is the ultimate alien artifact.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.563
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:04.647 --> 01:07.483
in the universe.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.360
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:12.063 --> 01:14.147
It demands
we question everything

01:14.232 --> 01:16.492
we have ever been taught.

01:16.576 --> 01:20.737
The evidence is all around us.

01:20.822 --> 01:24.166
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:24.325 --> 01:26.835
We are not alone.

01:26.994 --> 01:30.339
We have never been alone.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.257
NARRATOR:
Jerusalem.

01:40.341 --> 01:44.761
January 28, 2011.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.930
It is a quiet winter night

01:47.023 --> 01:49.691
inside the al-Aqsa
Mosque compound,

01:49.851 --> 01:51.693
which sits on the Temple Mount,

01:51.778 --> 01:54.363
a site considered
hallowed ground

01:54.447 --> 01:57.533
by Muslims, Christians and Jews.

01:57.692 --> 02:00.110
But at roughly 1:00 a.m.,

02:00.203 --> 02:02.362
in the sky above
the Dome of the Rock,

02:02.446 --> 02:07.543
an extraordinary scene unfolds
that is captured on video.

02:07.627 --> 02:11.296
This pulsating light,
which was witnessed

02:11.455 --> 02:15.458
from multiple different sources,
descends down...

02:15.543 --> 02:17.961
(people speaking
in foreign language)

02:18.045 --> 02:21.798
right on top
of the Temple Mount,

02:21.883 --> 02:24.226
and all of the sudden, a flash.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.811
(people shout)

02:25.895 --> 02:28.230
And it disappears
up into heaven.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.057
POPE:
If this is genuine,

02:31.151 --> 02:34.311
- it's of extreme significance.
- MAN: Whoa!

02:34.395 --> 02:37.489
It's a site
of immense significance

02:37.648 --> 02:41.994
to all three of the world's
main religions.

02:42.078 --> 02:46.823
They have all, for thousands
of years, worshiped there.

02:46.908 --> 02:49.334
It is a site where they believe

02:49.493 --> 02:53.997
there are things of great power,
maybe still hidden.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.759
TZADOK:
What happened? What was that?

02:57.844 --> 03:00.503
There are those who interpret
and understand this

03:00.588 --> 03:03.089
to have been
something technological

03:03.174 --> 03:05.926
possibly turning on.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.594
(people shout)

03:07.678 --> 03:10.689
TZADOK: Activating
something buried beneath.

03:10.773 --> 03:15.027
There are many who believe
that this pulsating light

03:15.186 --> 03:17.029
was connecting
with the Ark of the Covenant.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.608
NARRATOR:
The Ark of the Covenant?

03:21.701 --> 03:25.204
The golden chest built
to house the Ten Commandments?

03:25.363 --> 03:29.124
Could this incredible UFO event
have been connected

03:29.283 --> 03:31.201
to one of the most revered

03:31.285 --> 03:35.380
and most mysterious religious
artifacts of all time?

03:35.465 --> 03:39.134
TZADOK: Is it possible
that the Ark of the Covenant

03:39.219 --> 03:42.137
is still with us to this day?

03:42.222 --> 03:45.382
It's possible. We don't know.

03:45.466 --> 03:48.560
NARRATOR: According to
the stories of the Hebrew Bible,

03:48.719 --> 03:51.396
the Ark of the Covenant did,
at one time,

03:51.481 --> 03:55.234
reside in this very spot,
and there are those who believe

03:55.393 --> 03:58.144
it is still hidden
somewhere on the site.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.816
But this holy relic went missing
more than 2,500 years ago,

04:02.900 --> 04:05.652
and people have been
searching for it ever since.

04:05.745 --> 04:09.322
Considered the most sacred
and mysterious artifact

04:09.415 --> 04:11.166
in ancient Israel,

04:11.325 --> 04:14.586
the Ark of the Covenant
was revered by the Hebrew people

04:14.671 --> 04:17.831
as the embodiment
of God's presence on Earth.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.842
MICHAEL CARTER: What
was so special about the Ark

04:20.927 --> 04:23.503
was that it housed the history

04:23.587 --> 04:25.839
of the Israelites
once they left Egypt.

04:25.923 --> 04:29.268
It reminded a people
who had been slaves

04:29.427 --> 04:33.847
in Egypt for millennia
that they were not alone.

04:33.931 --> 04:36.858
That this god was
constantly with them.

04:37.018 --> 04:42.439
NARRATOR: The story of the
Ark begins in the 15th century BC.

04:42.523 --> 04:45.200
According to the Bible's
Book of Exodus,

04:45.285 --> 04:48.954
after the Israelites
were released from Egypt,

04:49.113 --> 04:51.206
God summoned Moses
to the peak of Mount Sinai

04:51.291 --> 04:53.616
and gave him two stone tablets

04:53.710 --> 04:56.962
carved with
the Ten Commandments.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.372
He also gave him
specific instructions

04:59.457 --> 05:01.875
for building
the Ark of the Covenant.

05:01.959 --> 05:04.127
McGOWAN: Moses was given
very specific measurements.

05:04.211 --> 05:06.713
It was to be
two and a half cubits long,

05:06.797 --> 05:09.391
one and a half cubits wide,
one and a half cubits deep.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.967
So, we're looking at a container

05:11.052 --> 05:12.561
that was a little over
four feet long

05:12.645 --> 05:14.813
and about two feet wide
and two feet deep.

05:14.972 --> 05:16.806
The container must be made
of acacia wood,

05:16.899 --> 05:19.067
that it must be covered
with gold.

05:19.152 --> 05:23.063
The top of the Ark was
to be surmounted by angels,

05:23.156 --> 05:27.659
two cherubim with large wings
that would face each other,

05:27.818 --> 05:30.412
and their wings
would cover the top of the Ark.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.417
NARRATOR: The Ark was
designed to be carried by poles,

05:35.501 --> 05:37.836
inserted into four gold rings,

05:37.920 --> 05:40.163
two on each side
of the container.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.423
JONATHAN YOUNG:
It was very important

05:41.582 --> 05:43.258
that no one touch the Ark.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.011
It was too powerful, too holy,

05:46.170 --> 05:48.180
and a person would die
if they touched it.

05:48.339 --> 05:51.007
It was also covered
in a very elaborate way

05:51.100 --> 05:53.685
so that passersby
wouldn't look at it.

05:53.844 --> 05:56.355
Such was the power of
the Ark of the Covenant,

05:56.439 --> 05:59.274
that it would be dangerous
even to look at it.

05:59.433 --> 06:03.103
HUGH NEWMAN: The lid of the
Ark was called the "mercy seat."

06:03.187 --> 06:05.530
And there was said to be
two cherubims on top

06:05.615 --> 06:08.617
with their wings
pointing to each other

06:08.701 --> 06:10.118
with a gap between them.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.445
This is actually the gap
where Yahweh, or God,

06:12.530 --> 06:15.707
was supposed to have spoken.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.794
MCGOWAN: In Exodus
25:22, God tells Moses,

06:18.878 --> 06:21.046
"When you build this,

06:21.130 --> 06:24.466
"I will meet you
between the cherubim,

06:24.550 --> 06:27.010
and I will give you commands."

06:29.138 --> 06:30.547
NARRATOR:
Ancient accounts of the Ark

06:30.640 --> 06:33.392
portray it as possessing
mysterious powers

06:33.551 --> 06:35.811
that aided the Israelites
during their journey

06:35.895 --> 06:38.146
to the Promised Land,

06:38.231 --> 06:42.475
parting rivers,
leveling mountains

06:42.568 --> 06:44.569
and destroying armies.

06:44.654 --> 06:48.657
But it was also incredibly
dangerous to handle.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.742
ERICH VON DANIKEN: Whatever
the Ark of the Covenant was,

06:50.901 --> 06:54.237
the object was definitely
very, very dangerous.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.748
In the second, uh,
Book of the King,

06:56.833 --> 07:00.168
you can read that
several accidents happened.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.506
A priest with the name
of Uzzah touched the Ark

07:04.590 --> 07:06.758
and like an electrical shock,

07:06.917 --> 07:09.678
he just fell on the ground,
and he was dead.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.338
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: In
the Bible, we have multiple stories

07:12.432 --> 07:15.016
of people not only dying

07:15.101 --> 07:17.177
when they came
in contact with the Ark,

07:17.261 --> 07:21.848
but some didn't die, but only
died a week or two later.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.600
And how did they die?

07:23.684 --> 07:26.603
Because they had boils
on their skin

07:26.696 --> 07:28.521
and their hair
started to fall out.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.782
Well, that is a sign

07:30.867 --> 07:34.027
of radioactive poisoning
or radioactive fallout.

07:34.111 --> 07:38.623
COLLINS: The most important
thing about trying to understand

07:38.708 --> 07:41.960
how the Ark of the Covenant
functioned

07:42.044 --> 07:45.121
is the fact
that specific instructions

07:45.214 --> 07:47.624
were given by God to Moses

07:47.708 --> 07:51.127
about how
it was to be manufactured.

07:51.212 --> 07:52.962
The exact size,

07:53.055 --> 07:55.215
how it is to be raised
off the ground,

07:55.308 --> 07:57.217
how it is to be carried.

07:57.301 --> 08:01.229
So there was specifics here
that had to be carried out,

08:01.314 --> 08:03.973
and this tells us,
almost certainly,

08:04.058 --> 08:06.485
that we are dealing
with technology.

08:06.644 --> 08:10.396
A technology that was given
either by God

08:10.481 --> 08:17.245
or by some kind of entity or
being of non-terrestrial origin.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.656
NARRATOR:
Is it possible,

08:19.749 --> 08:21.908
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

08:21.992 --> 08:24.753
that the baffling powers
ascribed to the Ark

08:24.837 --> 08:28.081
provide evidence that
it contained highly advanced

08:28.165 --> 08:32.335
and perhaps
extraterrestrial technology?

08:32.419 --> 08:36.598
In 957 BC,
construction was completed

08:36.682 --> 08:38.925
on King Solomon's Temple
in Jerusalem,

08:39.018 --> 08:40.852
built on the same site

08:41.011 --> 08:43.429
where the Dome of the Rock
stands today,

08:43.514 --> 08:46.015
and designed
with the primary purpose

08:46.108 --> 08:48.184
of housing
the Ark of the Covenant.

08:48.269 --> 08:51.863
The Ark would remain here
for 350 years

08:51.948 --> 08:56.535
and then disappear from
the historical record forever.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.287
In 586 BC,

08:59.372 --> 09:03.283
the Babylonians,
under King Nebuchadnezzar,

09:03.367 --> 09:08.880
sacked and destroyed Jerusalem
and the Temple of Solomon.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.883
It was said that
they carried away, to Babylon,

09:11.968 --> 09:14.460
all of the treasures
of the Israelites,

09:14.545 --> 09:16.471
the treasures of the temple.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.466
However, there is no mention
in any account

09:20.551 --> 09:22.894
that they took away
the Ark of the Covenant.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.139
So, what happened
to the Ark of the Covenant?

09:26.232 --> 09:30.893
CARTER: The first theory is
that Jeremiah or King Josiah

09:30.987 --> 09:33.479
took the Ark
and hid it away in a cave.

09:33.564 --> 09:36.316
There's another, uh,
piece of speculation

09:36.400 --> 09:39.578
is that the Babylonians just
took it and they desecrated it.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.248
But if they had done that,
people would've known about it.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.993
POPE: The voice of God
was heard though the Ark.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.671
And for those people
that believe the voice of God

09:49.830 --> 09:52.674
was extraterrestrial,
well, the Ark of the Covenant

09:52.833 --> 09:56.511
is the ultimate alien artifact.

09:56.596 --> 10:01.016
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists believe that finding the Ark

10:01.100 --> 10:03.435
will result
in incredible revelations

10:03.519 --> 10:06.605
about humanity's
extraterrestrial past

10:06.764 --> 10:10.183
and could also facilitate
direct communication

10:10.276 --> 10:13.695
with otherworldly entities
still watching over Earth today.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.951
But does the Ark still lie
hidden at Temple Mount?

10:20.110 --> 10:22.787
Many claim the most
compelling evidence

10:22.872 --> 10:26.708
points to the Ark leaving
Jerusalem centuries ago,

10:26.792 --> 10:31.421
spirited away by a band
of warrior monks.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.795
NARRATOR:
July 1099 AD.

10:38.879 --> 10:40.889
Muslim-controlled Jerusalem

10:40.973 --> 10:43.633
is captured
by medieval Christian forces.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.302
The bloody siege
leaves the city ransacked

10:46.387 --> 10:49.147
by the victorious crusaders.

10:51.058 --> 10:52.984
But spared from destruction

10:53.069 --> 10:57.238
are two mosques that have stood
on Temple Mount for 400 years.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.993
These holy sites were saved
to serve another purpose.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.412
The Dome of the Rock
is converted

11:04.571 --> 11:07.332
into a Catholic church.

11:07.491 --> 11:10.418
And the al-Aqsa Mosque
is given to a newly-formed

11:10.503 --> 11:14.839
monastic fighting force,
the Order of Solomon's Temple,

11:14.924 --> 11:17.676
also known
as the Knights Templar.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.921
YOUNG: This was
a holy order of knights

11:22.014 --> 11:24.424
who were interested
in the safety of travelers

11:24.517 --> 11:27.677
going from Europe
to Jerusalem, to the temple.

11:27.761 --> 11:29.145
And they would guard them...

11:30.681 --> 11:32.607
and they would
protect their wealth.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.694
They essentially invented
banking as a way to protect

11:35.778 --> 11:37.862
travelers from highwaymen.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.531
NARRATOR:
But protecting pilgrims

11:39.690 --> 11:41.524
was not the Templars'
only directive

11:41.617 --> 11:44.444
while stationed at Temple Mount.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.613
They were also charged
with searching for treasure

11:47.707 --> 11:50.458
and religious artifacts.

11:50.617 --> 11:54.620
CHILDRESS: The Knights Templars
got a commission from the pope

11:54.714 --> 11:57.373
to actually do excavations
at Solomon's Temple.

11:57.458 --> 12:00.042
And the Templars, uh,
that is largely what they did

12:00.136 --> 12:02.137
while they were in Jerusalem.

12:02.221 --> 12:06.725
The story there goes that
the Templars actually discovered

12:06.884 --> 12:11.137
a secret chamber
beneath the temple.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.733
They claimed to have found
all sorts of holy relics.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.810
And we know
they found certain things

12:17.895 --> 12:21.322
because they became
very rich very quickly.

12:21.482 --> 12:25.735
But legend said that amongst
all these things they found

12:25.819 --> 12:28.747
was the Ark of the Covenant.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.502
NARRATOR:
On July 4, 1187,

12:34.587 --> 12:37.747
the Knights Templar
were forced to leave Jerusalem

12:37.831 --> 12:41.092
when Muslim armies
retook the holy city.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.839
The Templars set sail
for Europe, and it was rumored

12:46.924 --> 12:48.767
that they carried with them
the holy relics

12:48.851 --> 12:51.093
they had recovered
at Temple Mount,

12:51.187 --> 12:54.439
including the Ark
of the Covenant.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.108
By the end of the 13th century,

12:57.267 --> 12:58.935
the Knights Templar
had established

12:59.028 --> 13:02.522
a new base of operations
in France.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.950
CORNWALL: I do believe that
the Templars did find the Ark

13:06.109 --> 13:09.871
and successfully
transported it to Paris,

13:09.955 --> 13:13.792
where they were hailed as heroes
for some reason overnight.

13:13.951 --> 13:16.619
Nobles were trying
to join the order.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.713
The king of France
was promoting them.

13:18.872 --> 13:21.216
I believe the reason for that
is because they succeeded

13:21.375 --> 13:23.635
in their mission
to find the Ark,

13:23.794 --> 13:26.045
which is why they were there
in the first place.

13:26.129 --> 13:29.057
NARRATOR: The Templars
used their vast wealth

13:29.141 --> 13:32.727
to finance the construction
of Chartres Cathedral,

13:32.812 --> 13:35.647
one of the finest examples
of Gothic-style architecture

13:35.731 --> 13:37.816
in the world.

13:37.975 --> 13:40.142
And it was rumored
that the Cathedral

13:40.227 --> 13:43.646
had a direct connection
to the Ark of the Covenant.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.325
COLLINS:
In 1966, in a book called

13:47.484 --> 13:50.411
<i>The Mysteries
of Chartres Cathedral,</i>

13:50.571 --> 13:52.572
Louis Charpentier claimed

13:52.665 --> 13:57.001
that the Templars had indeed
found this holy object

13:57.086 --> 14:00.338
and had brought it
back to France.

14:00.497 --> 14:03.174
And that this had,
some way, inspired

14:03.259 --> 14:07.595
the design
of Chartres Cathedral,

14:07.680 --> 14:11.924
which embodied many principles
of sacred geometry,

14:12.009 --> 14:15.770
mathematical ideas
that had been brought over

14:15.855 --> 14:20.099
from the Sufi, and Islamic
peoples of the holy land.

14:20.192 --> 14:26.606
Sufism included a lot of ideas
relating to sacred architecture.

14:26.690 --> 14:31.611
This was how to design
the perfect house of God.

14:31.695 --> 14:34.289
NARRATOR: Some believe
that the Knights Templar

14:34.373 --> 14:36.457
actually built
this breathtaking cathedral

14:36.617 --> 14:38.951
to house the Ark
of the Covenant.

14:39.036 --> 14:42.121
And they point to one
very credible source

14:42.205 --> 14:44.790
that claims the Ark
was deposited here:

14:44.884 --> 14:47.135
the cathedral itself.

14:47.219 --> 14:51.806
Carvings on the north portico
depict the Templars

14:51.891 --> 14:54.884
recovering the Ark of the
Covenant, then carrying it off,

14:54.968 --> 14:59.055
led by an angel with God
hidden overhead in a cloud.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.891
Inscribed in Latin text
are the words:

15:01.984 --> 15:04.727
"Here is hidden
the Ark of the Covenant."

15:04.811 --> 15:06.479
McGOWAN: There are
many legends in France

15:06.572 --> 15:09.065
about where the Ark was kept
during the time period

15:09.158 --> 15:10.909
the Templars were the guardians.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.486
Some say it was in the crypt
of Chartres Cathedral.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.656
It's likely that the Ark of
the Covenant was moved around

15:16.740 --> 15:19.751
to different locations in France
to protect it

15:19.910 --> 15:22.337
and to keep it
from being discovered.

15:22.496 --> 15:25.590
NARRATOR: All who have attempted
to find the Ark of the Covenant

15:25.749 --> 15:29.344
at Chartres Cathedral
have come up empty-handed.

15:29.503 --> 15:33.589
But if the Templars truly were
in possession of the Ark,

15:33.674 --> 15:36.100
there is good reason to believe
they would have moved it

15:36.259 --> 15:40.605
at least once more,
to keep its otherworldly powers

15:40.764 --> 15:42.932
from the hands
of a dangerous enemy:

15:43.025 --> 15:46.185
the king of France, Philip IV.

15:46.269 --> 15:48.613
CORNWALL: The
Templars were incredibly rich,

15:48.772 --> 15:51.941
and King Philip was
engaged in a series of wars

15:52.034 --> 15:54.285
that were depleting his coffers.

15:54.444 --> 15:56.862
He tried to become
their Grand Master

15:56.947 --> 16:00.375
and they said no.
They refused him.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.452
So, he decided to take
what they had by force instead.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.372
But they did know he was coming.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.959
It was obviously time
to get the Ark out of Paris.

16:10.052 --> 16:14.130
NARRATOR:
On Friday, October 13, 1307,

16:14.223 --> 16:16.557
King Philip of France,
with the backing

16:16.642 --> 16:18.884
of Pope Clement V,

16:18.978 --> 16:22.480
ordered the arrest
of every Templar in France.

16:25.475 --> 16:28.069
King Philip accused
the Templars of heresy,

16:28.153 --> 16:31.731
immorality, and worship
of a demonic idol.

16:31.815 --> 16:35.317
But ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that,

16:35.411 --> 16:37.403
based on accounts of the idol,

16:37.496 --> 16:41.240
this may be a case
of misunderstood technology.

16:41.324 --> 16:42.834
TSOUKALOS: There were
rumors that the Templars

16:42.993 --> 16:46.579
were in possession
of this horrible-looking idol

16:46.672 --> 16:49.248
with one glowing red eye

16:49.332 --> 16:52.084
and another eye
that's barely blinking.

16:52.177 --> 16:57.006
Of course, a-a technologically
primitive person

16:57.090 --> 17:00.852
would not recognize that
that is a type of a machine,

17:01.011 --> 17:04.689
but I think this was
an extraterrestrial device.

17:04.848 --> 17:07.358
McGOWAN: It was said
they spoke to this demon.

17:07.517 --> 17:09.351
That this demon
would speak back to them

17:09.436 --> 17:10.945
and give them instructions.

17:11.104 --> 17:13.355
We know from scripture,

17:13.449 --> 17:15.033
we know from the Bible itself

17:15.192 --> 17:17.535
that the Ark was built
as a communication device.

17:19.362 --> 17:20.705
NARRATOR:
For some researchers,

17:20.789 --> 17:22.948
the description
of a demonic idol

17:23.042 --> 17:24.950
with glowing red eyes

17:25.035 --> 17:27.545
that gave instructions
to the Knights Templar

17:27.704 --> 17:29.955
brings to mind
the biblical accounts

17:30.049 --> 17:32.875
of how the Israelite priests
communicated with God

17:32.968 --> 17:35.044
through the Ark of the Covenant.

17:35.128 --> 17:37.221
TZADOK:
The high priest

17:37.380 --> 17:39.807
was required
by biblical law to wear

17:39.966 --> 17:42.134
a special type of a breastplate,

17:42.219 --> 17:44.637
which had special types
of gemstones on it.

17:44.721 --> 17:48.232
The high priest could
oscillate his voice

17:48.317 --> 17:51.486
to create specific
types of sounds.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.573
It would cause these stones
to come alive.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.412
The stones on the breastplate
would light up.

18:01.571 --> 18:03.823
They would begin to emit
rainbow colors.

18:03.916 --> 18:07.576
So, you have light flashing
off of this high priest

18:07.669 --> 18:10.588
as he's firing up
the Ark of the Covenant.

18:10.747 --> 18:14.425
And then the Ark had
rainbow light coming off of it.

18:16.753 --> 18:19.680
NARRATOR: To this day,
many researchers believe

18:19.765 --> 18:22.424
that the idol the Templars
were accused of worshipping

18:22.509 --> 18:25.094
was the Ark of the Covenant.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.930
But if so, what became of it?

18:28.014 --> 18:32.527
Some suggest the world's
most sacred religious relic

18:32.686 --> 18:34.770
ultimately ended up

18:34.863 --> 18:36.948
hidden in a mysterious chapel

18:37.107 --> 18:39.784
in Scotland.

18:43.864 --> 18:48.292
NARRATOR:
Paris, France. March 18, 1314.

18:48.377 --> 18:52.121
Jacques de Molay,
the 23rd and final Grand Master

18:52.205 --> 18:53.706
of the Knights Templar,

18:53.790 --> 18:57.802
is executed
by order of King Philip IV.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.388
But according
to historical accounts,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.974
he already had a plan in place

19:03.058 --> 19:05.226
for the surviving Templars
to make their escape

19:05.385 --> 19:07.386
in the event of his capture.

19:07.470 --> 19:10.565
McGOWAN: Jacques de Molay
had an enormous responsibility

19:10.649 --> 19:11.983
to protect the legacy

19:12.142 --> 19:15.236
of who the Templars were
and what they stood for.

19:15.395 --> 19:17.572
And part of this legacy

19:17.656 --> 19:20.658
was their guardianship
of these holy relics

19:20.742 --> 19:23.327
and, specifically,
the Ark of the Covenant.

19:23.486 --> 19:28.741
NARRATOR: King Philip set out to
capture a fleet of 18 Templar ships

19:28.834 --> 19:31.085
that were said to be docked
at the port of La Rochelle

19:31.170 --> 19:33.329
on the Atlantic coast of France.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.756
But when the king's
forces arrived,

19:35.841 --> 19:37.633
there was not a ship in sight.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.671
COLLINS: The Knights Templar
disappeared, as well as

19:42.756 --> 19:44.348
many of the holy relics

19:44.433 --> 19:48.344
that they unquestionably
held in their possession.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.930
NARRATOR:
Vatican records suggest

19:51.014 --> 19:53.191
the fleet of ships carried
the escaping Templars

19:53.350 --> 19:55.860
and their mysterious treasure
to Scotland,

19:55.944 --> 19:59.021
where they were welcomed
by King Robert the Bruce.

19:59.105 --> 20:00.940
Like the Knights Templar,

20:01.033 --> 20:04.610
Robert the Bruce had been
excommunicated by the Pope.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.622
He was also embroiled
in a bitter war of independence

20:07.706 --> 20:10.124
against Edward II of England,

20:10.283 --> 20:11.626
and according to the story,

20:11.710 --> 20:14.119
the Templars joined his forces

20:14.204 --> 20:16.214
on the battlefield.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.624
CORNWALL:
There is a wonderful legend

20:18.708 --> 20:22.127
of knights in white

20:22.221 --> 20:24.463
at the Battle of Bannockburn
defeating, decimating

20:24.556 --> 20:26.465
the English army.

20:26.549 --> 20:28.476
The Templar Knights

20:28.560 --> 20:31.303
had to have been at that battle.

20:31.396 --> 20:35.316
NARRATOR: The Templars
were revered as great warriors,

20:35.400 --> 20:37.485
but some question
whether they were aided

20:37.644 --> 20:40.154
by a powerful weapon they may
have been carrying with them,

20:40.239 --> 20:42.490
the Ark of the Covenant.

20:44.234 --> 20:46.994
People have asked, could this
actually be used as a weapon?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.237
Of course it could be.

20:48.321 --> 20:49.905
I mean, can you imagine

20:49.990 --> 20:51.824
having that kind of technology?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.243
HENRY: There's no question
that the Ark of the Covenant

20:54.336 --> 20:56.078
radiated a power
that could be used

20:56.162 --> 20:57.755
for military advantage.

20:57.914 --> 21:00.174
When the Israelites
carried it into battle,

21:00.259 --> 21:04.512
it assisted them
in assuring their victory.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.090
McGOWAN: If the Ark
was carried before an army,

21:08.183 --> 21:10.434
that army would
become invincible.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.011
There are stories
of the Ark killing scorpions

21:12.104 --> 21:13.604
and serpents.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.264
The Ark, in many ways,
was protective,

21:15.348 --> 21:17.566
it was protective of the
Israelites on their journey.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.196
TZADOK: The Ark of the Covenant
would march before

21:22.281 --> 21:25.524
the children of Israel
as they went through the desert,

21:25.608 --> 21:29.778
clearing out anything
that was a danger to them.

21:29.863 --> 21:33.207
When you're in the wilderness,
you have wild animals,

21:33.366 --> 21:35.042
you have poisonous serpents.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.295
The Ark would prepare the way.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.964
How it did this
we still do not know.

21:40.048 --> 21:44.969
No one had actual
visual awareness

21:45.053 --> 21:47.805
or contact
with what was happening.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.548
All we have is the mystery

21:49.641 --> 21:53.060
of knowing that it did march
miles before the people,

21:53.219 --> 21:54.562
preparing the way for them.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.317
COLLINS: In my opinion,
the Ark of the Covenant

21:59.401 --> 22:02.144
functioned as a capacitor,

22:02.237 --> 22:06.815
drawing in electrostatic
energies from

22:06.908 --> 22:10.402
the environment
into its interior.

22:10.487 --> 22:13.405
But that something
was then triggering it

22:13.498 --> 22:17.585
to radiate out some kind of
electromagnetic field.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.745
One that was so strong

22:19.829 --> 22:23.758
that it would strike people down
who came too close.

22:23.917 --> 22:25.584
And I would say

22:25.668 --> 22:28.596
that it contained
something radioactive.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.932
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Ark of the Covenant

22:32.017 --> 22:33.684
was a radioactive device

22:33.769 --> 22:36.428
that could be used
as a devastating weapon?

22:36.513 --> 22:39.273
And could knowledge
of the Ark's awesome powers

22:39.358 --> 22:41.016
be a reason that

22:41.101 --> 22:43.694
the Knights Templar kept
this dangerous object hidden

22:43.853 --> 22:46.772
and away from the hands
of their enemies?

22:46.856 --> 22:49.950
Some researchers say
that Templar allies,

22:50.035 --> 22:52.361
the powerful Sinclair family,

22:52.445 --> 22:54.196
understood the importance

22:54.280 --> 22:55.948
of protecting the Ark and built

22:56.032 --> 22:58.951
an elaborate hiding place
for the dangerous object,

22:59.044 --> 23:01.036
Rosslyn Chapel.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.630
COLLINS:
Rosslyn Chapel

23:02.714 --> 23:04.873
is one of the most mysterious

23:04.966 --> 23:07.709
holy places
in the whole of Scotland.

23:07.794 --> 23:11.639
Many people have
likened its design,

23:11.723 --> 23:13.715
its cruciform design,

23:13.800 --> 23:17.478
to the layout
of King Solomon's Temple.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.888
And this has raised the question

23:19.973 --> 23:21.974
of whether or not

23:22.058 --> 23:24.226
the Knights Templar

23:24.310 --> 23:27.312
may have brought
the Ark of the Covenant

23:27.397 --> 23:28.897
to Scotland,

23:28.982 --> 23:33.068
and that Rosslyn Chapel
could have been constructed

23:33.153 --> 23:35.913
as its new resting place.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.999
CHILDRESS:
That chapel contains a crypt

23:39.084 --> 23:40.659
deep beneath it,

23:40.743 --> 23:43.170
and many historians believe
that the Ark of the Covenant

23:43.329 --> 23:45.497
was kept there for a while.

23:45.582 --> 23:49.418
McGOWAN: Rosslyn Chapel is
full of Templar symbolism, including

23:49.502 --> 23:51.929
carvings of Templar Knights and

23:52.013 --> 23:55.516
a gravestone that belonged
to another Templar.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.925
The Templars are inextricable

23:57.018 --> 23:58.760
with the legends
of Rosslyn Chapel.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.021
Rosslyn Chapel
is really the symbol

24:01.106 --> 24:02.940
of Templar presence in Scotland.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.268
NARRATOR: While millions
of people are convinced

24:06.361 --> 24:08.112
that the Knights Templar
recovered

24:08.271 --> 24:10.114
the Ark of the Covenant
at Temple Mount

24:10.273 --> 24:13.200
and hid it somewhere
along their journeys,

24:13.285 --> 24:16.445
likely in France or Scotland,

24:16.538 --> 24:18.873
there are just as many
who believe

24:18.957 --> 24:20.949
that it was taken
out of Jerusalem

24:21.042 --> 24:23.452
long before the Templars
even existed.

24:23.536 --> 24:26.788
And some profess
to have seen the Ark

24:26.882 --> 24:28.874
and witnessed
its ethereal powers

24:28.958 --> 24:30.959
with their own eyes

24:31.044 --> 24:32.970
in a most unlikely place:

24:33.129 --> 24:35.639
Ethiopia.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.721
NARRATOR:
Aksum, Ethiopia.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.307
November 2020.

24:45.391 --> 24:49.061
Pro-government troops storm
the ancient sacred city,

24:49.145 --> 24:51.647
searching out soldiers
aligned with the region's

24:51.740 --> 24:54.408
former ruling party, the TPLF.

24:54.567 --> 24:56.744
It is one episode in a conflict

24:56.903 --> 24:59.079
that has been raging for weeks,

24:59.239 --> 25:03.000
but this time, the soldiers
target Aksum's holiest site,

25:03.084 --> 25:06.587
the Church of Our
Lady Mary of Zion.

25:06.746 --> 25:09.164
Incredibly, hundreds

25:09.257 --> 25:10.841
of civilians race to the defense

25:10.926 --> 25:12.927
of the church
and prevent the soldiers

25:13.086 --> 25:14.303
from gaining access.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.675
A staggering 800 are reportedly
killed in the process.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.761
But more than the church itself,

25:22.854 --> 25:25.773
they were protecting the
extraordinary religious artifact

25:25.932 --> 25:28.267
that is said to be held inside,

25:28.360 --> 25:31.612
the Ark of the Covenant.

25:31.771 --> 25:34.031
HENRY: There are many who
believe that the Ark is in Aksum.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.276
In fact, it's believed
by millions

25:37.369 --> 25:40.371
of Orthodox Christians that the
Ark of the Covenant is there.

25:42.031 --> 25:44.283
NARRATOR: Although
many researchers believe

25:44.367 --> 25:47.452
there is strong evidence that
the Knights Templar recovered

25:47.546 --> 25:49.380
the Ark of the Covenant
during their excavations

25:49.464 --> 25:51.123
at Temple Mount,

25:51.216 --> 25:55.052
others say that the Ark
had been removed from Jerusalem

25:55.211 --> 25:58.130
centuries before
the Templars even arrived.

25:58.214 --> 26:00.975
The main proponents
of this theory are the

26:01.134 --> 26:02.968
Christians of Ethiopia,

26:03.052 --> 26:05.145
who believe the Ark
was brought to Aksum

26:05.305 --> 26:07.889
nearly 3,000 years ago,

26:07.974 --> 26:12.477
where it has continued to exert
its strange powers ever since.

26:12.571 --> 26:16.907
One version of the fate
of the Ark of the Covenant

26:17.066 --> 26:21.903
is contained within
a Ethiopian holy book

26:21.988 --> 26:24.748
known as the<i> Kebra Nagast.</i>

26:24.907 --> 26:27.585
It's a story involving
King Solomon,

26:27.669 --> 26:30.254
who had the Ark,

26:30.413 --> 26:33.424
and his meeting
with the Queen of Sheba.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.668
And it was said that
they had a liaison,

26:36.761 --> 26:40.180
and that a son was born
to the Queen of Sheba

26:40.340 --> 26:42.174
by the name of Menelik.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.509
And that, eventually,

26:44.594 --> 26:48.597
Menelik traveled from
his homeland of Ethiopia

26:48.690 --> 26:53.444
to visit his father
Solomon in Israel.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.104
NARRATOR:
According to the story,

26:56.189 --> 26:58.190
when Menelik left Israel,

26:58.283 --> 27:01.026
he and his men secretly took
the Ark with them.

27:01.110 --> 27:03.621
The details of
their journey back

27:03.705 --> 27:05.697
to Ethiopia
once again illustrate

27:05.790 --> 27:07.282
the otherworldly power

27:07.367 --> 27:09.951
of the Ark of the Covenant.

27:10.045 --> 27:13.464
They first go
from Jerusalem to Gaza,

27:13.623 --> 27:15.624
and then from there
they travel into Egypt

27:15.717 --> 27:16.958
with the Ark of the Covenant.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.295
And then the Ark of the Covenant

27:20.380 --> 27:23.474
is made to fly their wagon,

27:23.558 --> 27:27.552
and they then fly
across the Red Sea

27:27.646 --> 27:32.391
to the Saudi Arabian Yemen
side of the Red Sea.

27:32.475 --> 27:34.985
This is all detailed
in the<i> Kebra Nagast.</i>

27:35.144 --> 27:37.154
This book is thousands
of years old.

27:37.313 --> 27:39.823
It is clearly described
that Solomon's son

27:39.982 --> 27:43.235
were flying with
the Ark of the Covenant.

27:43.319 --> 27:46.163
They were not on the ground,
they were flying

27:46.322 --> 27:47.989
over Egypt.

27:48.074 --> 27:49.491
Some temples were destroyed

27:49.584 --> 27:51.493
because of the noise
and the trembling.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.462
They were flying
and came to Ethiopia.

27:55.081 --> 27:58.417
The Ark of the Covenant was
then put in a special church

27:58.510 --> 28:00.678
built for it in Aksum.

28:02.255 --> 28:05.265
One Ethiopian Coptic priest

28:05.350 --> 28:07.759
is allowed to live

28:07.852 --> 28:10.688
in that special church

28:10.847 --> 28:12.681
and only he

28:12.765 --> 28:15.684
is allowed to view the Ark,

28:15.777 --> 28:17.778
and he is essentially,
while he lives,

28:17.862 --> 28:19.988
the custodian
of the Ark of the Covenant.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.534
NARRATOR:
The guardian of the Ark

28:23.693 --> 28:26.361
chooses who will be
his successor when he dies.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.780
The job is both highly coveted

28:28.873 --> 28:30.374
and highly dangerous.

28:30.533 --> 28:33.544
NEWMAN:
The guardians who've been there

28:33.703 --> 28:36.213
generation after generation
protecting it

28:36.297 --> 28:38.382
have gone blind.

28:38.541 --> 28:41.126
They've had radiation poisoning.
They've got cancer.

28:41.219 --> 28:44.888
So, it seems that the Ark may
have had radioactive qualities,

28:44.973 --> 28:47.132
which actually
cause harm to people

28:47.216 --> 28:49.226
if you're in the vicinity
of it for too long,

28:49.385 --> 28:51.553
and this echoes
the original stories

28:51.646 --> 28:56.150
saying it was some
all-powerful device.

28:56.309 --> 28:58.402
VON DANIKEN: The same
description you find in the book

28:58.561 --> 29:01.062
of the kings of the Ethiopians,
the<i> Kebra Nagast,</i>

29:01.156 --> 29:03.815
there they say,
the inside of the Ark

29:03.908 --> 29:05.659
is not from this planet.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.737
NARRATOR: Some believe
that the ailments suffered

29:08.830 --> 29:09.988
by those said to guard the Ark

29:10.081 --> 29:12.157
at the church in Aksum

29:12.250 --> 29:15.744
provide compelling evidence that
they are, in fact, protecting

29:15.828 --> 29:18.580
an otherworldly technology.

29:18.664 --> 29:20.591
But there is still another,

29:20.750 --> 29:23.093
even more audacious theory
regarding

29:23.252 --> 29:26.087
what happened
to the Ark of the Covenant

29:26.181 --> 29:29.224
and a man who claims
to have found it.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.849
NARRATOR:
Johannesburg, South Africa.

29:37.934 --> 29:41.770
1985.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.689
British scholar Tudor Parfitt

29:44.783 --> 29:47.951
is giving a lecture
on his academic specialty,

29:48.036 --> 29:51.538
the history of ancient Jews
who settled in Africa.

29:51.697 --> 29:53.457
During his lecture,

29:53.616 --> 29:56.126
Parfitt is intrigued
by a group in the audience.

29:56.285 --> 29:59.538
They're dressed in traditional
African garments,

29:59.622 --> 30:03.458
but wearing what look like
Jewish skullcaps.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.293
PARFITT:
They explained that they were

30:05.378 --> 30:07.379
the Lemba people,

30:07.472 --> 30:09.807
and that they were Jews.

30:09.891 --> 30:13.393
The story that they told me
was rather compelling,

30:13.478 --> 30:16.647
and they invited me to go
with them to their villages,

30:16.806 --> 30:18.148
which I did.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.226
And I was convinced
by what I saw

30:21.310 --> 30:23.654
in these little villages
that there was something

30:23.738 --> 30:25.647
profoundly Semitic
about this group.

30:25.731 --> 30:27.491
(speaking native language)

30:29.735 --> 30:32.070
NARRATOR: Although the
Lemba are native to Zimbabwe,

30:32.163 --> 30:33.738
they not only observed

30:33.823 --> 30:36.992
Semitic dietary laws
and cultural practices,

30:37.085 --> 30:39.411
they claimed to be
descendants of Jews

30:39.495 --> 30:43.090
who fled the Holy Land
thousands of years ago...

30:43.174 --> 30:48.169
Jews known in history as
the ten lost tribes of Israel.

30:48.254 --> 30:50.088
And according to the Lemba,

30:50.172 --> 30:52.757
their ancestors brought
a mysterious object

30:52.851 --> 30:56.094
into Africa from
the great temple in Jerusalem.

30:56.178 --> 30:58.430
In his book,
<i>The Lost Ark of the Covenant,</i>

30:58.523 --> 31:01.683
Parfitt recounts
the description of the object,

31:01.767 --> 31:03.602
called the<i> ngoma lungundu,</i>

31:03.695 --> 31:05.353
as a wooden drum

31:05.446 --> 31:08.523
used to store sacred objects.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.942
PARFITT:
They would often tell me about

31:11.035 --> 31:15.447
the<i> ngoma lungundu,</i>
the-the drum which thunders.

31:15.540 --> 31:19.534
It's quite similar
to the Ark of the Covenant.

31:19.627 --> 31:22.203
Like the Ark of the Covenant,

31:22.297 --> 31:24.873
there were carrying rings
on each corner.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.625
Like the Ark of the Covenant,

31:26.718 --> 31:30.211
it had the reputation
of being a murderous weapon

31:30.296 --> 31:32.222
that they carried into war,

31:32.307 --> 31:35.976
and it assured victory
in combat.

31:36.135 --> 31:39.220
So, in lots of ways,

31:39.305 --> 31:41.398
the, uh,<i> ngoma</i>

31:41.557 --> 31:44.651
seemed to be

31:44.736 --> 31:47.821
very similar to the idea
of the Ark of the Covenant.

31:47.980 --> 31:50.490
HUSSAIN: Not only is there
this secret object that's lost,

31:50.575 --> 31:53.327
it's a sacred wooden object
that's carved,

31:53.486 --> 31:55.153
that has rings on it

31:55.237 --> 31:57.572
that poles are put through
to transport it.

31:57.657 --> 32:01.752
Let's look at the Ark of War,
as it's known in Deuteronomy,

32:01.911 --> 32:04.412
and let's think about
this, uh,<i> ngoma,</i>

32:04.505 --> 32:06.331
this-this drum that thunders.

32:06.424 --> 32:11.428
This idea that this drum speaks
with the voice of God.

32:11.587 --> 32:14.673
The Ark of the Covenant
is the presence of God.

32:14.757 --> 32:17.935
Could they in fact be one
and the same object?

32:18.019 --> 32:20.854
NARRATOR:
According to the Lemba,

32:21.013 --> 32:24.775
the<i> ngoma lungundu</i> had been kept
in a cave for centuries

32:24.859 --> 32:27.686
before mysteriously
disappearing.

32:27.770 --> 32:30.697
But could the powerful
object they described

32:30.782 --> 32:33.692
have really been the lost
Ark of the Covenant?

32:33.776 --> 32:37.454
And were the Lemba
truly the descendants

32:37.538 --> 32:39.790
of the ancient Israelites?

32:41.784 --> 32:43.794
In 1997,

32:43.953 --> 32:46.713
thanks to advances
in DNA technology,

32:46.872 --> 32:48.465
Tudor Parfitt and a group

32:48.624 --> 32:51.209
of British scientists
are able to identify

32:51.293 --> 32:54.212
a specific genetic signature
for descendants

32:54.296 --> 32:57.799
of ancient Israelite priests
called kohanim,

32:57.892 --> 33:00.218
who were entrusted
by Moses's brother Aaron

33:00.302 --> 33:01.720
with the full knowledge

33:01.804 --> 33:04.982
of the Ark of the Covenant's
hidden powers.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.483
HENRY:
We know that it was the

33:06.642 --> 33:09.060
descendants of Aaron
who are responsible

33:09.153 --> 33:12.147
for caretaking and operating
the Ark of the Covenant.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.316
Recently, geneticists
have discovered

33:15.401 --> 33:18.245
that that lineage continues
up into the modern day.

33:18.404 --> 33:20.321
Now, if the Ark of the Covenant

33:20.415 --> 33:22.824
were brought into
our world today,

33:22.917 --> 33:24.576
it would make sense
that we would need

33:24.669 --> 33:26.661
the descendants of Aaron

33:26.754 --> 33:29.673
to once again operate the Ark.

33:29.832 --> 33:32.417
NARRATOR:
To Parfitt's astonishment,

33:32.501 --> 33:35.920
when members of the Lemba
undergo DNA testing,

33:36.005 --> 33:38.256
they are found to have
the genetic signature

33:38.349 --> 33:40.091
of the kohanim,

33:40.176 --> 33:43.353
called the
Cohen Modal Haplotype.

33:45.097 --> 33:47.098
PARFITT: We were looking
for the Cohen Model Haplotype

33:47.191 --> 33:49.267
among the Lemba,

33:49.360 --> 33:51.269
and we found the Lemba

33:51.362 --> 33:54.022
to be relatively rich

33:54.115 --> 33:56.199
in the Cohen Model Haplotype.

33:57.869 --> 34:02.789
Once it seemed that the
priestly tribe of the Lemba was

34:02.874 --> 34:07.044
the same as the priestly tribe
of the Jews,

34:07.203 --> 34:08.545
then the question
of the<i> ngoma</i> became

34:08.704 --> 34:11.456
very much more
interesting to-to me.

34:11.549 --> 34:14.959
NARRATOR: Parfitt spent
much of the next decade

34:15.044 --> 34:17.554
traveling across Africa
and the Middle East,

34:17.638 --> 34:21.308
following every lead
in search of the<i> ngoma lungundu.</i>

34:21.392 --> 34:23.894
In 2007,

34:23.978 --> 34:26.229
he was ready
to give up the search,

34:26.388 --> 34:29.140
but decided to follow
one last lead

34:29.233 --> 34:33.311
to a small museum in Harare,
the capital of Zimbabwe.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.731
HUSSAIN: He goes to
the museum, and he goes

34:36.816 --> 34:38.909
into one of the storerooms,

34:39.068 --> 34:40.652
and it's almost
straight out of a movie.

34:40.745 --> 34:44.081
PARFITT: I looked
around the various places

34:44.240 --> 34:46.583
where things might have
been deposited,

34:46.742 --> 34:49.878
and to my considerable surprise,
I found it.

34:51.506 --> 34:53.832
HUSSAIN:
It's an old piece of wood,

34:53.925 --> 34:56.843
but he's amazed because one
of the first things he notices

34:57.002 --> 34:58.753
is the scorch marks.

34:58.846 --> 35:02.015
It's been burned
exactly like the story

35:02.100 --> 35:04.684
that says, oh, at a, at
a particular point in history,

35:04.769 --> 35:07.095
there was a fire that came out
of this that actually

35:07.179 --> 35:10.524
killed the people who were
standing, uh, beside this.

35:10.683 --> 35:13.860
NARRATOR: Critics complained
that the crude wooden object

35:13.945 --> 35:17.355
did not resemble the biblical
descriptions of the Ark.

35:17.448 --> 35:20.867
But Parfitt points out that,
according to Lemba tradition,

35:21.026 --> 35:25.530
the original wooden box was
destroyed in a fiery explosion,

35:25.614 --> 35:28.291
and this smaller object
was reconstructed

35:28.376 --> 35:30.794
from a piece
of the original artifact.

35:32.538 --> 35:35.874
One could imagine that there
have been a succession of Arks,

35:35.967 --> 35:38.459
which have been used,

35:38.553 --> 35:42.046
but worn out and were rebuilt,

35:42.140 --> 35:43.640
and which finally led

35:43.799 --> 35:47.635
to the Ark, which, today,
is to be found

35:47.720 --> 35:51.639
in a small museum in Harare.

35:51.732 --> 35:55.068
HUSSAIN: It's this amazing
story because here's Tudor Parfitt,

35:55.227 --> 35:57.654
this great, respected academic,

35:57.813 --> 36:00.231
who's now announced
that he has discovered

36:00.324 --> 36:01.908
the Ark of the Covenant.

36:02.067 --> 36:05.620
That makes international news,
and there's great debate.

36:07.489 --> 36:10.167
PARFITT:
If one is to think that the Ark

36:10.251 --> 36:12.577
exists anywhere,
why not in Africa?

36:12.661 --> 36:14.671
Makes a lot more sense
than many other places

36:14.755 --> 36:17.841
where it has been
imagined to be.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.010
The Lemba were very
straightforward about their Ark.

36:20.169 --> 36:22.596
They said, at a certain point,
it was destroyed.

36:22.755 --> 36:24.005
We made another one.

36:24.098 --> 36:28.185
But what I do think
is that this, uh,

36:28.269 --> 36:32.931
object is probably
the closest thing

36:33.024 --> 36:35.525
that has ever been found

36:35.684 --> 36:39.020
to the original
Ark of the Covenant.

36:39.104 --> 36:40.697
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

36:40.856 --> 36:43.608
that an ancient
wooden object on display

36:43.692 --> 36:45.619
in a museum in Zimbabwe

36:45.778 --> 36:48.872
represents the last remnants
of the Ark of the Covenant?

36:49.031 --> 36:52.209
Some researchers believe
the otherworldly

36:52.368 --> 36:54.535
technology that
the scorched wooden vessel

36:54.629 --> 36:57.714
is alleged to have held
still exists,

36:57.873 --> 37:01.209
and it will soon be found,
not in Africa,

37:01.302 --> 37:03.461
but back in its rightful home

37:03.554 --> 37:05.889
on Temple Mount.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.313
NARRATOR:
Mount Scopus, Israel.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.650
Here, in northeastern Jerusalem,

37:16.734 --> 37:18.735
lie 9,000 tons of soil

37:18.819 --> 37:21.905
illegally excavated and removed
from Temple Mount

37:21.989 --> 37:25.492
in 1999 by the Islamic
religious trust.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.069
Excavations are not permitted

37:28.153 --> 37:30.914
on the sacred space
of Temple Mount,

37:31.073 --> 37:34.334
but because this soil
has already been removed,

37:34.418 --> 37:37.504
both experts and volunteers have
been able to sift through it,

37:37.588 --> 37:39.831
and, incredibly,

37:39.915 --> 37:43.418
it has produced hundreds of
thousands of ancient artifacts.

37:43.502 --> 37:46.170
Might clues pointing
to the existence

37:46.264 --> 37:49.432
of the Ark of the Covenant
and, perhaps, its location,

37:49.517 --> 37:52.519
be found in the soil
from Temple Mount?

37:54.355 --> 37:56.439
TZADOK:
In modern-day Israel,

37:56.524 --> 37:59.851
many have tried
to go under Temple Mount,

37:59.935 --> 38:03.196
and it is well known
that there are secret catacombs,

38:03.281 --> 38:06.274
and that there are passageways
that have been blocked off,

38:06.367 --> 38:08.868
which lead to many,
many secrets.

38:08.953 --> 38:13.114
What is down there, who can say?

38:13.198 --> 38:16.451
POPE:
Temple Mount is a site

38:16.535 --> 38:18.878
where many people believe

38:18.963 --> 38:22.206
there are things of great power,

38:22.291 --> 38:23.458
maybe still hidden.

38:23.542 --> 38:27.637
It's a site
of immense significance

38:27.796 --> 38:32.058
to all three of
the world's main religions.

38:34.219 --> 38:36.563
HUSSAIN: The importance of
Temple Mount is really interesting.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.475
For Jews,
when Isaac is offered up

38:40.559 --> 38:42.393
for sacrifice by Abraham,

38:42.478 --> 38:45.405
this happens
on the Temple Mount.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.490
It then gets connected

38:47.649 --> 38:50.234
to the Christian tradition
that comes later.

38:50.319 --> 38:52.162
For Muslims,

38:52.321 --> 38:54.072
this spot is important
because this is where

38:54.165 --> 38:57.417
the prophet Muhammad
ascends up to heaven.

38:57.576 --> 38:59.336
There very much is this idea

38:59.420 --> 39:01.245
that there's a holiness
in this spot.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.664
Observant Jews aren't even
supposed to walk

39:03.749 --> 39:05.842
on the area of the Temple Mount

39:05.926 --> 39:08.178
because the space
is so powerful.

39:08.337 --> 39:11.506
The idea is that
the presence of God is here.

39:11.590 --> 39:15.426
NEWMAN: Interestingly,
this is the actual site where,

39:15.511 --> 39:18.846
in 2011, there were
multiple reports of

39:18.931 --> 39:22.025
strange lights
seen above Jerusalem.

39:22.109 --> 39:24.527
(men exclaiming)

39:24.612 --> 39:27.438
NARRATOR: If the event recorded
on video over Temple Mount

39:27.523 --> 39:30.533
on January 28, 2011,

39:30.618 --> 39:33.778
was, in fact, related
to the Ark of the Covenant,

39:33.862 --> 39:36.614
as some ancient astronaut
theorists suspect,

39:36.707 --> 39:40.126
could it be evidence that
the Ark still resides there?

39:40.211 --> 39:42.295
Many people think it was fake,

39:42.454 --> 39:45.548
but we have too many witnesses
from too many sources

39:45.633 --> 39:48.134
that can prove that this
actually happened.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.471
It gives us to speculate

39:51.555 --> 39:53.881
that, indeed, the Ark

39:53.974 --> 39:56.559
was sending
and receiving signals

39:56.644 --> 39:59.562
from some actual,
tangible place,

39:59.721 --> 40:04.651
from which we will have contact
in time to come.

40:04.735 --> 40:09.147
NARRATOR: As far as ancient
astronaut theorists are concerned,

40:09.240 --> 40:12.316
whether the Ark of the Covenant
lies beneath Temple Mount

40:12.401 --> 40:15.495
or is hidden
thousands of miles away,

40:15.579 --> 40:17.321
one thing is certain,

40:17.406 --> 40:21.418
it remains the world's
most important lost relic.

40:23.328 --> 40:24.587
CHILDRESS:
I think it's very possible

40:24.672 --> 40:27.999
that the Ark of the Covenant
does still exist.

40:28.092 --> 40:32.345
And I feel that it's likely
that at least some people

40:32.504 --> 40:34.088
actually know where it is.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.349
TSOUKALOS:
The Ark of the Covenant

40:36.434 --> 40:39.093
is one of the greatest pieces

40:39.178 --> 40:41.179
in the ancient astronaut theory

40:41.263 --> 40:45.024
because there was
an actual physical object

40:45.109 --> 40:47.602
that had a connection

40:47.686 --> 40:50.688
to the so-called
celestial realm.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.949
So, I mean, the Ark of the
Covenant is one of the most

40:53.033 --> 40:57.111
enduring ancient mysteries
of all time.

40:57.196 --> 41:00.114
HENRY:
The Ark holds the promise

41:00.199 --> 41:03.367
that it will bring
a new revelation with it.

41:03.452 --> 41:07.046
It could completely transform
our civilization.

41:07.131 --> 41:10.258
This is the potential power
with the Ark of the Covenant.

41:11.886 --> 41:15.138
TZADOK: The Ark
might actually be the proof

41:15.222 --> 41:18.224
that we have been seeking
throughout human history

41:18.309 --> 41:21.385
of our forgotten past

41:21.470 --> 41:24.889
and our greater potential
of contact

41:24.973 --> 41:26.900
with the greater universe
and world.

41:26.984 --> 41:30.820
Indeed, if we could have the Ark

41:30.905 --> 41:33.147
and operate it

41:33.232 --> 41:35.241
and make contact,

41:35.400 --> 41:36.743
who would we be talking to?

41:36.902 --> 41:39.120
What would we be opening up?

41:40.915 --> 41:42.582
NARRATOR:
Could an otherworldly device

41:42.666 --> 41:44.742
of unfathomable power

41:44.835 --> 41:48.505
that our ancestors encountered
thousands of years ago

41:48.589 --> 41:51.424
still exist somewhere
on Earth today?

41:51.509 --> 41:55.670
Perhaps the Ark of the Covenant
will soon be revealed

41:55.754 --> 41:58.681
to humanity once again,

41:58.840 --> 42:01.518
and within this sacred box,
we will find

42:01.677 --> 42:05.513
the undeniable proof
of our celestial origins.
