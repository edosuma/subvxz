00:18.661 --> 00:20.390
- Lights up!
- Beginners, please!

00:20.663 --> 00:22.631
- Your five-minute call, sir.
- Places.

00:22.665 --> 00:25.099
Places. Everyone to their places.

00:25.168 --> 00:26.668
Sh. Quiet, everyone.

00:26.669 --> 00:29.160
Opening nights?
I love opening nights.

00:30.673 --> 00:33.198
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Good evening, Charles.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.768
- Sir Herbert, how are you?
- This is my wife.

00:35.178 --> 00:36.941
- Oh, Lady Herbert.
- How do you do?

00:36.942 --> 00:37.737
May I give you a peck?

00:38.181 --> 00:39.681
One of Mr Barrie's finest?

00:39.682 --> 00:41.513
Oh, that genius Scotsman
has done it again.

00:41.684 --> 00:43.914
It's the best thing I've produced
in 25 years.

00:44.187 --> 00:46.712
I already have investors interested
back home in New York.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.352
See you on Broadway!

01:04.206 --> 01:06.971
First positions, people.

01:08.211 --> 01:10.907
Standing by, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:11.164 --> 01:13.462
If you could take
your opening positions, please.

01:17.670 --> 01:21.572
Beginners, please take
your opening positions.

01:21.591 --> 01:24.992
Audience are coming in. Standing by.

01:28.097 --> 01:29.860
- Good audience.
- Sorry?

01:29.861 --> 01:31.600
Good audience tonight.

01:31.601 --> 01:33.933
OK. That's great, thank you.
How much longer?

01:34.103 --> 01:36.298
Um, ten minutes, sir.

01:38.107 --> 01:40.940
I love opening nights.

01:41.110 --> 01:43.510
I want to dance with your wife
at the after-party.

01:43.913 --> 01:45.471
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good evening, Mr Frohman.

01:45.748 --> 01:47.032
- How are you, John?
- Very well.

01:47.033 --> 01:49.831
It's the best thing
that I've produced in 25 years.

01:50.119 --> 01:52.087
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Healthy and wealthy, I see.

01:52.121 --> 01:54.112
You've rearranged a holiday
for me and I won't forget it.

01:54.123 --> 01:55.590
- For you, Charles, anything.
- You won't regret it.

01:55.625 --> 01:56.614
I'm sure.

01:56.842 --> 01:59.709
- Have you got the tickets?
- They're in my pocket.

02:00.429 --> 02:03.626
- There's Mrs Barrie.
- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.

02:03.933 --> 02:08.233
We were so hoping to speak
with your husband before the show.

02:08.437 --> 02:11.895
- Have you seen him?
- I'm not sure where he is, actually.

02:30.743 --> 02:34.329
We do miss seeing you on stage.
You were so wonderful.

02:34.330 --> 02:39.461
Yes, well, it's been some time now.
Are you right to find your seat?

02:39.835 --> 02:41.836
Oh, yes, yes.

02:41.837 --> 02:44.931
See you at the party, then.

02:45.057 --> 02:46.490
Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie

02:46.642 --> 02:49.736
and remind him that they're doing his play
this evening.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.512
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

03:13.336 --> 03:14.496
Let's close the doors.

03:56.162 --> 03:58.323
Really, I mustn't
inconvenience you in this way.

03:58.664 --> 04:00.598
I can wait quite well in the shop.

04:00.666 --> 04:05.194
'Tis no inconvenience.
The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.

04:05.195 --> 04:06.570
Really, you are uncommonly good.

04:06.672 --> 04:09.163
Sorry, sir.

04:09.175 --> 04:12.338
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you
that the play's begun.

04:12.678 --> 04:15.761
- Though I imagine you know that.
- They hate it.

04:15.762 --> 04:18.844
- Sir?
- It's like a dentist's office out there. Why?

04:19.185 --> 04:25.055
- I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.
- What do you think? Do you like it?

04:25.191 --> 04:28.626
- I've just been hired here, sir.
- Yes or no? I'm not bothered.

04:28.627 --> 04:32.062
- I'm not really qualified to...
- Do you like it? Is it crap?

04:32.198 --> 04:34.496
- Crap, sir?
- Go on, say it. Just say it.

04:34.497 --> 04:36.168
It's shite, isn't it? Go on. Say it.

04:36.202 --> 04:39.171
- Don't know if I'm...
- "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.

04:39.205 --> 04:40.729
- It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.
- I knew it.

04:41.207 --> 04:44.973
- No, I haven't even seen it.
- I knew it. Thank you.

04:44.974 --> 04:47.201
Thank you very much.

04:49.715 --> 04:53.173
Might I knock a tune, milord,
for a moment?

04:57.223 --> 04:58.520
I'm an old man...

04:59.058 --> 05:00.787
..and I've seen few of the sights.

05:18.627 --> 05:20.618
Absolute rubbish from start to finish.

05:20.996 --> 05:22.497
Yes, I found it fearfully dull.

05:22.498 --> 05:24.432
Say goodbye to your investment, old boy.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.934
Good to see you. My apologies.

05:27.002 --> 05:28.503
We'll get them with the next one,
Charles, I promise.

05:28.504 --> 05:31.940
- Of course we will, James.
- I know you put a lot into this one.

05:32.007 --> 05:35.966
A fortune, James, but I am fortunate
because I can afford to lose a fortune.

05:36.512 --> 05:38.639
- Can you?
- No, I can't. How are you?

05:39.315 --> 05:41.249
- Arthur.
- James.

05:41.317 --> 05:43.114
You were sorely missed
at the last club meeting.

05:43.319 --> 05:44.308
Was I?

05:44.570 --> 05:48.404
We were beginning to wonder
which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

05:48.405 --> 05:50.174
You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,
didn't you?

05:50.276 --> 05:53.302
Oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,
should we?

05:53.303 --> 05:55.338
I don't see why not.

05:55.614 --> 05:58.879
If you ask me, the problem
lies in our batting order.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.635
- James.
- Hello, darling.

06:00.703 --> 06:02.432
You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,
don't you?

06:02.705 --> 06:04.434
- Mrs Snow.
- Mr Barrie.

06:04.435 --> 06:05.655
Mr Snow.

06:06.091 --> 06:08.616
The Snows have been waiting
to meet with you all evening.

06:08.677 --> 06:10.941
- Oh, yes.
- Is that right?

06:11.096 --> 06:16.796
Your play this evening,
it was remarkable, wasn't it?

06:17.436 --> 06:19.495
Was it?

06:19.939 --> 06:25.343
Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.
I'm glad you liked it.

06:27.229 --> 06:29.390
How did you feel it went?

06:30.232 --> 06:32.325
- I think I can do better.
- Really?

06:48.334 --> 06:51.836
- Mary? Hello?
- Yes, James?

06:51.837 --> 06:56.740
I'm headed off for the park if you'd
like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.

06:56.842 --> 06:59.276
You'll be working, won't you?

07:00.346 --> 07:02.644
Perhaps, yes.

07:02.848 --> 07:05.646
I'll let you to your work then.

07:13.192 --> 07:16.491
- Morning, Mr Barrie.
- Morning, Emma.

07:19.698 --> 07:21.222
- Have a good day, sir.
- And you.

07:22.534 --> 07:26.163
That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.

07:27.039 --> 07:31.066
That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.

08:00.573 --> 08:04.065
Who do you belong to?
Come on, boy. Come on.

08:07.796 --> 08:11.789
Excuse me, sir,
you're standing on my sleeve.

08:11.790 --> 08:14.526
Am I? So sorry.

08:15.671 --> 08:17.866
I might point out
you're lying under my bench.

08:18.173 --> 08:20.174
I have to, I'm afraid.

08:20.175 --> 08:24.669
I've been put in a dungeon
by the evil Prince George.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.981
I'm sorry if it bothers you.

08:27.516 --> 08:31.179
Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,
there isn't much to be done now, is there?

08:31.180 --> 08:33.068
Perhaps I could slide a key to you
through the bars.

08:33.322 --> 08:39.056
I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil
Prince George has tortured many men.

08:39.445 --> 08:40.945
I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir?

08:40.946 --> 08:45.349
My brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.327
Aha, Prince George, I gather.

08:47.786 --> 08:52.018
I understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.

08:52.019 --> 08:55.935
I'm not horrible really, but
a firm ruler, yes. Kind and tolerant.

08:56.345 --> 08:59.508
And what precisely is...
What did you say your name was?

08:59.548 --> 09:02.449
- Michael.
- What precisely is Michael's crime?

09:02.468 --> 09:05.403
- He's my younger brother.
- Ah.

09:05.604 --> 09:10.769
- Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.
- That's all right.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.808
- Do you mind us playing with your dog?
- No. Go on.

09:13.062 --> 09:17.055
This is Jack, second in line to the throne
and that one's Michael. He's only five.

09:17.366 --> 09:20.451
And I'm in prison for it.

09:20.452 --> 09:24.889
- I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you?
- We're not bothering him, Mum.

09:24.990 --> 09:26.855
Michael, darling,
come out from under there.

09:26.856 --> 09:28.786
I can't. I'm in prison.

09:29.328 --> 09:31.353
Oh, I see.

09:31.547 --> 09:33.548
JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.

09:33.549 --> 09:37.178
JM Barrie, the author? A pleasure.
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.

09:37.386 --> 09:39.013
- Are you a writer?
- I am.

09:39.171 --> 09:42.368
He's a playwright, Jack.
Quite a famous one, at that.

09:42.424 --> 09:44.688
- I apologize. I imagine you're writing.
- No. Not at all.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.196
- Where's Peter?
- What have you written, Mr Barrie?

09:48.263 --> 09:54.964
Well, currently, I make my living
entertaining princes and their courts

09:54.965 --> 09:57.481
with my trained bear, Porthos.

09:57.823 --> 09:59.323
If you command your brother,
Peter, to join us,

09:59.324 --> 10:02.725
I am willing, Prince George,
to give you just such a performance

10:03.245 --> 10:06.043
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner, of course.

10:06.044 --> 10:07.716
- Very well.
- Very well.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.168
Now...

10:10.169 --> 10:14.538
I want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth.

10:17.376 --> 10:22.177
Some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,

10:22.381 --> 10:26.818
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle.

10:26.852 --> 10:33.087
Only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety.

10:35.227 --> 10:38.560
- What did you bring me over here for?
- Peter.

10:38.561 --> 10:41.499
This is absurd. It's just a dog.

10:43.402 --> 10:45.996
Come on, darling.

10:46.288 --> 10:50.208
"Just a dog"? "Just"?

10:50.209 --> 10:52.370
Porthos, don't listen to him.

10:52.544 --> 10:54.341
Porthos dreams of being a bear

10:54.413 --> 10:59.146
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying he's "just a dog"?

10:59.147 --> 11:01.325
What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.

11:01.336 --> 11:05.602
That's like saying, "He can't climb
that mountain, he's just a man."

11:05.841 --> 11:10.301
Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."

11:11.680 --> 11:13.739
"Just."

11:15.684 --> 11:20.883
Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.

11:21.190 --> 11:22.690
Peter, where are your manners?

11:22.691 --> 11:27.628
With those eyes, my bonny lad,
I'm afraid you'd never see it.

11:28.080 --> 11:33.416
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,

11:33.452 --> 11:37.582
I can turn around right now and see...

11:37.583 --> 11:39.651
the great bear, Porthos.

11:41.009 --> 11:43.239
Dance with me.

12:44.907 --> 12:48.809
Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen
a performance quite like it.

12:48.911 --> 12:52.938
We're here every day, and the bear
is always more than happy to perform.

12:53.031 --> 12:55.158
Well, perhaps we'll see you here
tomorrow then.

12:55.167 --> 12:57.431
Perhaps.

12:57.669 --> 13:00.502
- Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.
- Bye.

13:00.539 --> 13:02.837
Bye.

13:02.925 --> 13:06.361
- Peter, didn't you enjoy that?
- I've seen better.

13:06.378 --> 13:09.443
Well, Michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him,

13:09.444 --> 13:12.509
and Peter insisted
that Michael was hardly a prisoner

13:12.634 --> 13:15.535
and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.

13:17.139 --> 13:19.767
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.

13:19.858 --> 13:23.385
- What's her name?
- Sylvia. Um...

13:23.386 --> 13:27.264
Mrs... something Davies.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.597
Llewelyn Davies?

13:30.869 --> 13:34.999
- You know her?
- I know who she is, of course.

13:35.157 --> 13:37.658
Why, she's a du Maurier,
for heaven's sake.

13:37.659 --> 13:43.996
Her father was the artist.
Her brother's the actor.

13:44.166 --> 13:49.069
And there was something... tragic
that happened with her husband.

13:49.254 --> 13:52.155
Oh, yes. He died.

13:52.341 --> 13:55.742
Cancer of the jaw, I believe.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.403
That's horrible.

13:57.846 --> 14:03.876
Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of.

14:04.853 --> 14:08.152
If it wasn't for her mother's help...

14:11.860 --> 14:14.658
James.

14:14.863 --> 14:20.096
- We should have them to dinner.
- Should we?

14:20.369 --> 14:24.703
Absolutely. I've always wanted
to meet Madam du Maurier.

14:24.704 --> 14:29.037
Why, she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing.

14:41.890 --> 14:46.020
- What are you writing about?
- Oh.

14:46.395 --> 14:48.659
Nothing of any great consequence.

14:49.865 --> 14:52.459
I can't write.

14:52.868 --> 14:55.496
Have you ever kept a journal?

14:56.371 --> 14:59.431
Ever tried your hand at writing a play?

15:00.375 --> 15:02.536
Well, then how do you know?

15:03.378 --> 15:06.814
I know. That's all.

15:06.882 --> 15:11.319
I see. Where's your mother today
and the rest of the boys?

15:11.386 --> 15:15.322
Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.

15:16.758 --> 15:21.923
I'm sure everyone would be happy
to see you though. One afternoon.

15:24.483 --> 15:26.747
I should leave you to your writing.

15:30.822 --> 15:33.324
Peter.

15:33.325 --> 15:35.623
I'll see you later then.

15:45.203 --> 15:48.743
Why didn't you tell me, Charles?
You knew it wasn't any good.

15:48.744 --> 15:52.283
Why didn't you tell me. James?
You knew it wasn't any good. Hm?

15:52.294 --> 15:56.958
I took an extended lease on the theater,
keeping the actors on.

15:57.299 --> 16:01.201
- I don't have another play.
- I'm sure you will.

16:03.805 --> 16:05.932
- Won't you?
- We'll see.

16:06.308 --> 16:08.970
I need you to sign for the storage,
Mr Frohman.

16:09.811 --> 16:13.872
- Lower.
- Easy does it. Take your time.

16:19.321 --> 16:23.052
It was never meant to be taken seriously.

16:23.325 --> 16:26.920
You know what happened, James?
They changed it.

16:27.829 --> 16:31.822
- They changed what?
- The critics.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.962
They made it important.

16:40.842 --> 16:42.275
Hm?

16:42.344 --> 16:44.437
What's it called?

16:46.848 --> 16:49.567
What's it called?

16:49.568 --> 16:52.286
- "Play."
- "Play."

17:04.165 --> 17:06.396
Bang, bang, bang!

17:06.751 --> 17:08.513
Bang!

17:10.422 --> 17:12.756
Return the boy to us, you nasty lnjun.

17:12.757 --> 17:16.124
Our people teach boy lndian ways,
make him great warrior.

17:16.511 --> 17:20.310
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.

17:20.464 --> 17:22.558
Bang, bang, bang!

17:25.103 --> 17:28.435
Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.

17:28.607 --> 17:32.948
You go. Spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy.

17:32.949 --> 17:37.290
Fly back to our chief.
Tell her of my brave defeat.

17:37.532 --> 17:40.000
That's crazy. Indians can't fly.

17:40.035 --> 17:42.036
Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.

17:42.037 --> 17:44.699
Listen to us, boy.
This lnjun kidnapped you.

17:45.123 --> 17:49.210
Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.

17:49.211 --> 17:54.012
I teach you ways of the brave.
I take you as my own son.

17:54.332 --> 17:56.800
You are not my father.

17:58.637 --> 18:00.764
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

18:00.805 --> 18:02.568
- I've got him!
- Let me go!

18:02.641 --> 18:05.041
- Stop it, you two.
- Ooh, we are awful, aren't we?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.224
- I'm warning you.
- Oh, I'm scared.

18:07.429 --> 18:09.090
Of course, you had a bit of fun
for a change.

18:09.347 --> 18:11.941
- Stop it, you two. Get off!
- Don't.

18:11.942 --> 18:13.963
- Jack!
- Stop it!

18:13.985 --> 18:17.079
- Get off, George!
- Peter.

18:19.658 --> 18:23.492
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it wasn't your fault.

18:23.578 --> 18:25.375
I'm afraid it might have been.

18:25.580 --> 18:29.482
To be honest, I'm just happy you got him
to join in the game.

18:29.584 --> 18:32.075
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.

18:32.087 --> 18:35.887
Mr Barrie, it's more
than I've been able to achieve.

18:36.091 --> 18:39.891
Peter's a different boy
since his father died.

18:40.095 --> 18:43.894
You know, I don't think
he's even had a good cry about it.

18:43.895 --> 18:47.694
Well, grief affects us all
in different ways, doesn't it?

18:47.695 --> 18:49.229
Yes, it does.

18:49.604 --> 18:55.804
Oh, by the way, my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.988
Your mother as well.

18:58.989 --> 19:00.914
Oh.

19:00.982 --> 19:04.782
How kind. That would be lovely.

19:07.405 --> 19:08.565
Well...

19:08.790 --> 19:11.792
Don't you all look
lovely in your little suits?

19:11.793 --> 19:17.629
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is
that we've not met until this evening.

19:18.133 --> 19:19.633
How kind of you to say so.

19:19.634 --> 19:24.162
Not at all. I can't tell you how many times
I've been to a charity or a social event

19:24.163 --> 19:27.973
and seen your name listed
among the organizers.

19:30.145 --> 19:35.048
It's the very thing I would love to do myself

19:35.317 --> 19:38.402
if I could just find the time.

19:38.403 --> 19:42.305
My problem is in finding the time
to do everything else.

19:42.407 --> 19:45.409
At the moment I am running
two households.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.742
Sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper.

19:47.779 --> 19:48.939
Mother.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.911
My house is quite large enough for us all,

19:50.949 --> 19:55.147
- but the idea of living with me seems...
- Not now, please, mother.

19:55.587 --> 19:58.522
- We help her keep the house in order.
- Don't interrupt, George.

19:58.523 --> 20:02.126
- Where did you get your manners?
- Sorry, Grandmother.

20:02.127 --> 20:07.588
Mr Barrie, I understand you've become
playmates of my grandchildren.

20:07.766 --> 20:12.669
- Oh, they indulge me, really.
- On the contrary.

20:12.771 --> 20:17.834
The other day we took to an exploration
of darkest Africa in our garden.

20:18.143 --> 20:23.513
But Mr Barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a... What was it?

20:23.514 --> 20:25.981
Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.

20:26.151 --> 20:28.676
Yes, and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus.

20:28.677 --> 20:30.086
Fingers like sausages.

20:30.155 --> 20:33.613
And we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft.

20:34.159 --> 20:37.492
But the fishing was good, wasn't it?

20:41.166 --> 20:43.100
James.

20:45.553 --> 20:47.919
Please.

20:47.922 --> 20:50.641
- Bye.
- Thank you so much.

20:50.642 --> 20:52.371
- Lovely evening.
- Thank you. Bye.

20:52.644 --> 20:56.205
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:59.651 --> 21:03.143
Well, that was a disaster.

21:03.655 --> 21:08.592
Painful.
Utterly painful to see.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.492
I don't know what you mean.
I had a lovely time.

21:11.613 --> 21:13.697
Oh, James, please.

21:13.698 --> 21:18.032
"My problem is in finding
the time to do everything else."

21:18.203 --> 21:22.765
- I never felt so judged in my life.
- Judged? How do you mean?

21:22.766 --> 21:25.073
A grown man, for heaven's sake,

21:25.210 --> 21:28.008
playing all day long with children?

21:28.380 --> 21:32.789
In any case, I hardly think they'll be
the social contact we'd hoped for.

21:32.790 --> 21:37.199
I hadn't really thought of them that way.
I just enjoy their company.

21:37.472 --> 21:40.703
He's been a good friend to us, Mother.

21:40.704 --> 21:44.468
Yes. But what does that mean? Hm?

21:44.479 --> 21:45.446
Surely you don't intend...

21:45.980 --> 21:50.940
..to keep spending your afternoons
with those children, do you?

21:54.989 --> 21:56.616
And so today, ladies and gentlemen,

21:58.209 --> 22:00.643
using only the wind
and his own physical strength,

22:00.795 --> 22:04.253
George Llewelyn Davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere

22:04.299 --> 22:06.667
using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.

22:06.668 --> 22:09.330
- Go on, George.
- You're going to break it, George.

22:09.554 --> 22:11.647
- George, stop!
- I just need a bit more speed.

22:11.648 --> 22:13.504
I want to do it.

22:13.808 --> 22:16.436
Hold off a bit, George.
I think it's in need of a tail.

22:16.437 --> 22:18.422
Oh, wait.

22:20.014 --> 22:22.078
- Here. James, this will do.
- That's a good idea.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.143
- No, it's not heavy enough.
- I want to do it.

22:24.352 --> 22:28.152
- You coming, Peter?
- Porthos!

22:28.323 --> 22:30.382
It'll work this time.

22:30.408 --> 22:33.343
Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.

22:33.361 --> 22:34.528
- Michael?
- Yeah?

22:34.529 --> 22:38.021
- Now, would you like to give it a go?
- Yes, please.

22:38.032 --> 22:41.468
- Oh, he can't run fast enough.
- Of course he can.

22:41.836 --> 22:44.361
- Let him try, Jack.
- Now, George, you hold the kite.

22:44.422 --> 22:45.422
George.

22:45.423 --> 22:49.325
Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.
Come on, Peter.

22:49.677 --> 22:54.705
Right, George, hold it up. Darling,
you've got to run now. Ready? Ready?

22:54.766 --> 22:57.701
- Run! Run, Michael!
- Run!

22:58.269 --> 23:02.365
- Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.
- I don't think he's fast enough.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.340
It's not going to work
if no one believes in him.

23:04.442 --> 23:06.842
- Now, give him a chance.
- Michael, go back to your starting position.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.302
- Come on, darling, try again.
- George, you take the kite.

23:09.397 --> 23:15.461
Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath
of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.

23:15.904 --> 23:18.737
Right. Look, I think I feel a bit
more breeze. Are you ready, Michael?

23:18.790 --> 23:21.782
- You can do it, Michael.
- You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.

23:21.783 --> 23:23.704
- Run!
- That's it!

23:24.212 --> 23:27.714
Yes! He did it!

23:27.715 --> 23:30.946
Keep running! Keep running!

24:00.582 --> 24:02.982
What are you writing about now?

24:03.084 --> 24:05.245
Oh, just making notes.

24:05.336 --> 24:09.739
I'm never really certain what they're about
until I've read them over later.

24:10.425 --> 24:12.620
Something about the kite?

24:15.179 --> 24:17.739
Now, why do you ask that?

24:19.434 --> 24:21.402
I don't know.

24:21.436 --> 24:26.373
If I were a writer I think I could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today.

24:26.524 --> 24:31.235
Perhaps you should then. That's
a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try?

24:31.236 --> 24:35.946
I hope you haven't been talking about
anything too serious with this one.

24:36.317 --> 24:40.276
No. Talking a bit of silliness really.

24:48.997 --> 24:50.965
Can we have him for supper?

24:50.999 --> 24:53.331
Have him to stay for supper, Michael.
We're not cannibals.

24:53.501 --> 24:54.900
You are welcome, you know.

24:57.505 --> 25:00.019
Sylvia. Mr Barrie.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.533
Where have you been?

25:02.760 --> 25:04.523
Flying a kite, Mother,
and having a wonderful time.

25:04.762 --> 25:06.559
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming this evening.

25:06.731 --> 25:09.816
No? Well, apparently you forgot then.

25:09.817 --> 25:12.911
- I brought some supper along for us all.
- You didn't need to do that.

25:13.021 --> 25:15.455
Well, there's no food in the house, is there?

25:15.523 --> 25:17.650
Really. You don't need to wait
till the cupboard is bare.

25:17.909 --> 25:19.610
Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.

25:19.611 --> 25:22.774
Wipe feet. There's been
enough tracking round here.

25:23.114 --> 25:26.311
George, I thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house.

25:26.312 --> 25:28.483
Coat, Michael, please. Yes.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.605
- And... coat hanger. Good.
- Will we see you tomorrow?

25:32.606 --> 25:36.291
No. You're going to be helping
round the house tomorrow.

25:36.461 --> 25:39.123
Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.

25:39.347 --> 25:41.747
You can't do everything yourself.

25:41.933 --> 25:47.200
Look at you. You're horribly flush.
You're wearing yourself out.

25:47.201 --> 25:50.533
Thank you for a lovely day, James.
Excuse me, Mother.

25:50.775 --> 25:56.714
So from tomorrow, we're going to have
some discipline around here.

25:56.715 --> 26:01.316
And not one of you will escape.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.105
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Sarah.

26:08.126 --> 26:12.290
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Emma.

26:20.338 --> 26:22.397
You missed supper.

26:23.808 --> 26:27.175
Perhaps I'll have something later.
I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.

26:27.176 --> 26:31.312
Are you sure? It was a lovely meal. Duck.

26:31.566 --> 26:35.332
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.

26:35.436 --> 26:39.805
Is that right? Listen, what would you think
of loaning Emma out to the Davies

26:39.941 --> 26:41.441
for the occasional evening?

26:41.442 --> 26:43.842
They don't actually have a cook.

26:44.779 --> 26:48.180
I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here?

26:51.169 --> 26:54.764
I imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again. That's all.

26:54.765 --> 26:57.505
That's very charitable of you.

26:58.593 --> 27:01.687
Perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well.

27:02.096 --> 27:04.097
And what about linen?

27:04.098 --> 27:07.033
I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby.

27:07.034 --> 27:09.402
Please, Mary, stop.

27:10.438 --> 27:14.602
Maybe she can send over
some of the things we've run short on.

27:14.603 --> 27:17.275
My husband, for example.

27:18.196 --> 27:21.427
We rarely see him in this house.

27:21.699 --> 27:24.429
That hasn't seemed to bother you
for some time now.

28:09.580 --> 28:15.348
Lords and ladies, His Royal Highness,
King Michael the Benevolent,

28:15.349 --> 28:17.838
protector of the realm.

28:17.839 --> 28:20.740
That scepter's made of wood.

28:20.842 --> 28:23.902
Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,
don't we?

28:24.345 --> 28:29.510
No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made
of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

28:29.511 --> 28:31.818
The means to an end, Peter.

28:32.270 --> 28:35.762
What we've done is taken
an old hunk of wood

28:35.773 --> 28:40.039
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold.

28:41.229 --> 28:44.790
- There you go.
- What's this?

28:44.816 --> 28:50.413
All great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title.

28:50.905 --> 28:53.169
Open it.

28:56.210 --> 28:58.201
"The Boy Castaways."

28:58.212 --> 29:02.740
"Being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers Davies,

29:03.217 --> 29:07.721
faithfully set forth by...
Peter Llewelyn Davies."

29:07.722 --> 29:10.714
Kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that.

29:10.808 --> 29:13.777
Stab him, George. You can do it.

29:14.262 --> 29:16.856
I still have no idea what to write.

29:17.148 --> 29:19.708
Write about anything.
Write about your family.

29:19.851 --> 29:22.649
- Write about the talking whale.
- What whale?

29:22.737 --> 29:28.801
The one that's trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out. Come sit down.

29:31.996 --> 29:35.955
I have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the Davies brothers myself.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.265
- A play?
- A play indeed, yes.

29:39.503 --> 29:41.994
And I would be extremely honored

29:42.006 --> 29:46.443
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters.

29:46.510 --> 29:49.274
I don't know what to say.

29:49.275 --> 29:51.106
Say yes.

29:53.017 --> 29:54.017
Good man.

29:54.018 --> 29:56.111
Porthos! That's mine. Let go.

29:56.354 --> 29:59.222
I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.

29:59.223 --> 30:04.126
You should have been in bed
half an hour ago, young man.

30:04.779 --> 30:07.373
I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline.

30:07.374 --> 30:10.717
Nonsense. Young boys
should never be sent to bed.

30:10.785 --> 30:13.845
They always wake up a day older.

30:14.121 --> 30:18.080
And then, before you know it,
they're grown.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.126
Their father would have been horrified.

30:20.127 --> 30:22.322
Of course, he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either.

30:22.630 --> 30:25.877
He'd have tied him up in the yard.

30:25.878 --> 30:29.125
Right! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.

31:19.053 --> 31:22.181
You mean a lot to my boys, you know.

31:23.641 --> 31:26.474
Especially Peter.

31:27.228 --> 31:31.255
It seems to me
that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.

31:33.200 --> 31:38.832
I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't
hurt as deeply as children do when they...

31:38.833 --> 31:41.300
when they lose someone.

31:44.161 --> 31:49.121
I lost my elder brother, David,
when I was just Peter's age.

31:49.166 --> 31:52.158
And it nearly destroyed my mother.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.662
James, I'm so sorry.

31:56.674 --> 32:00.576
Your poor mother.
I can't imagine losing a child.

32:00.678 --> 32:02.703
Aye.

32:03.681 --> 32:06.047
She didn't get out of bed for months.

32:06.350 --> 32:08.784
She wouldn't eat.

32:08.936 --> 32:12.167
I tried everything to make her happy, but...

32:13.441 --> 32:15.841
she only wanted David.

32:15.943 --> 32:17.570
So...

32:17.695 --> 32:19.788
one day...

32:20.781 --> 32:23.875
I dressed myself in David's clothing

32:26.287 --> 32:28.671
and I went to her.

32:28.672 --> 32:31.869
You must have frightened her to death.

32:32.093 --> 32:37.861
I think it was the first time
she ever actually... looked at me.

32:42.436 --> 32:45.530
And that was the end of the boy James.

32:48.025 --> 32:50.926
I used to say to myself
he'd gone to Neverland.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.946
Where?

32:52.947 --> 32:56.542
Neverland. It's a wonderful place.

33:06.494 --> 33:09.861
I've not spoken about this before
to anyone.

33:10.498 --> 33:12.398
Ever.

33:22.309 --> 33:26.268
What's it like... Neverland?

33:28.933 --> 33:31.868
One day I'll take you there.

33:33.404 --> 33:35.099
Wait a minute, James.
He's a fairy?

33:35.406 --> 33:39.103
Er, no. He's the irrepressible
spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.

33:39.104 --> 33:42.208
- Tinker Bell is a woman?
- She's not a woman. She's a fairy.

33:42.413 --> 33:45.405
He is a boy who stays young forever.

33:45.416 --> 33:47.748
James, how does anyone
stay young forever? It doesn't work.

33:47.918 --> 33:50.614
He just believes, Charles.
He imagines life the way he wants it to be,

33:50.921 --> 33:56.052
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him, see?

33:56.053 --> 33:58.622
James, I'm your friend.
You're coming off a flop.

33:58.929 --> 34:03.229
- You have a man who is a fairy.
- No, a boy who has a fairy.

34:03.230 --> 34:04.881
And this girl calls herself Tinker.

34:05.052 --> 34:09.079
And you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.056
- That's a lot of water.
- It's a lot of water.

34:11.058 --> 34:14.858
- Yes, and that's a lot of money.
- It is, but we can fake the water.

34:15.062 --> 34:17.860
Oh, well, if we can fake the water
then I'm sure your play will be a hit.

34:18.065 --> 34:21.431
You know what I think I'll do? I think
I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...

34:21.569 --> 34:22.433
Long enough and hard enough?

34:22.570 --> 34:26.973
Yes, and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me.

34:27.074 --> 34:28.837
- That's right. That's it.
- Yes.

34:29.076 --> 34:31.976
How does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile?

34:32.079 --> 34:34.239
- He swallows it.
- Ah, of course he does.

34:36.333 --> 34:37.891
Out!

34:40.221 --> 34:41.638
How was he?

34:41.639 --> 34:43.630
- Well done.
- Good show!

34:45.726 --> 34:47.920
I finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game

34:47.922 --> 34:50.891
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation.

34:51.098 --> 34:52.815
It's perfect actually.

34:52.815 --> 34:55.045
Spend a good deal of time with them,
don't you?

34:55.319 --> 34:57.617
Every moment I can spare, in fact.

34:57.821 --> 34:59.948
I'm glad for you.

35:00.324 --> 35:03.851
And Mrs Davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well.

35:03.911 --> 35:08.473
You should be aware though, James,
what some people have been saying.

35:08.832 --> 35:12.632
Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up
if I thought the rumors would pass.

35:12.836 --> 35:15.703
I'm not surprised. What are they saying?

35:17.424 --> 35:18.925
Very well.

35:18.926 --> 35:22.384
That you spend much more time with Mrs
Davies than you do with your own wife.

35:22.429 --> 35:25.125
She's a widow. And...

35:25.432 --> 35:28.731
And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.

35:29.520 --> 35:34.753
There have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys.

35:34.942 --> 35:37.035
And why.

35:37.895 --> 35:42.195
That's outrageous. How could anyone
think something so evil?

35:42.399 --> 35:46.893
They're children.
They're innocent children.

35:48.072 --> 35:50.348
You find a glimmer of happiness
in this world,

35:50.349 --> 35:52.625
there's always someone
who wants to destroy it.

35:52.660 --> 35:59.031
No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think
many will give credence to such nonsense.

35:59.166 --> 36:01.691
Then why is no one sitting with them?

36:02.970 --> 36:05.666
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,

36:06.056 --> 36:12.017
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down.

36:15.566 --> 36:18.364
Are you sure your wife doesn't
object to us taking over your cottage

36:18.365 --> 36:19.517
for the summer, James?

36:19.653 --> 36:21.951
- She doesn't go there anymore.
- Really?

36:22.072 --> 36:24.836
It's such a relief to get away.
You'll come and visit, I hope?

36:25.075 --> 36:27.839
- Of course. Are we in?
- Everyone in?

36:28.078 --> 36:30.945
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim?
- Er, no.

36:46.180 --> 36:48.205
Out of the way
or I'll make haggis out of you.

36:48.682 --> 36:50.741
Get the sheep out the way.

37:08.068 --> 37:11.799
- Are we there yet?
- Almost. Almost there.

37:12.072 --> 37:15.098
I can see the cottage!

37:32.893 --> 37:35.885
- Shall we explore, Michael?
- Don't tear your clothes, please.

37:35.896 --> 37:38.922
- Come on. Follow me.
- Be careful of stinging nettles.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.923
Hurry up, everyone.

37:45.906 --> 37:49.535
- Would you like to see the rest of it?
- Mm. Yes.

38:11.465 --> 38:12.965
'Ello!

38:12.966 --> 38:16.532
Thought you could escape
from Captain Swarthy, eh?

38:16.533 --> 38:20.099
Off to the ship with you, then.
Off to the ship, son!

38:22.476 --> 38:26.708
So now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us,

38:26.980 --> 38:29.676
or we'll toss you to the sharks.

38:30.150 --> 38:35.053
- How marvelous.
- Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?

38:35.155 --> 38:38.613
- No one's escaped, Captain.
- Excellent work, matey.

38:38.659 --> 38:39.591
Now then.

38:39.660 --> 38:43.061
Now is your only chance to speak.

38:43.163 --> 38:46.599
Who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

38:46.667 --> 38:48.999
- I am!
- Not finished yet.

38:49.002 --> 38:52.369
To enter upon
the most dangerous chapter

38:52.506 --> 38:55.839
in your young
and soon-to-be-wasted lives?

38:57.144 --> 38:59.145
What did you say? What are doing, son?

38:59.146 --> 39:02.411
Are you giggling? On my ship?
Giggling? What did you say?

39:02.649 --> 39:04.879
- I said I'm ready, Captain.
- What's your name, boy?

39:05.152 --> 39:08.121
I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

39:08.155 --> 39:10.487
Cut him loose, matey.

39:10.657 --> 39:14.855
Welcome aboard, Curly.
Your job will be to mop the deck.

39:15.662 --> 39:17.960
And who be you, young squire?

39:18.165 --> 39:23.535
My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared
by men and greatly desired by the ladies.

39:23.537 --> 39:24.526
Jack!

39:24.788 --> 39:28.849
Welcome aboard, Nibs.
You shall polish all wood surfaces.

39:28.850 --> 39:31.158
Grab a hold of that rigging.

39:31.462 --> 39:34.659
- And you, lad?
- I'm Peter.

39:35.048 --> 39:39.485
That's not a pirate name.
What about Dastardly Jim, eh?

39:39.553 --> 39:42.004
No. Just Peter.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.456
I like my name.

39:45.559 --> 39:47.891
Very well.

39:48.061 --> 39:53.795
In punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.

39:53.796 --> 39:56.001
Cut him loose.

40:18.091 --> 40:20.992
- What are you playing again?
- The boy.

40:21.094 --> 40:22.493
What have you got...? Excuse me.

40:23.096 --> 40:25.997
Mr Barrie, sir?

40:26.099 --> 40:29.262
There's been a mistake here, sir.
It says here I'm to play the nanny.

40:29.603 --> 40:34.802
- I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh?
- You're not actually the nanny.

40:34.803 --> 40:36.701
You're a dog.

40:37.110 --> 40:39.111
- What?
- A Newfound land.

40:39.112 --> 40:41.512
We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.

40:41.615 --> 40:44.049
Rrr.

40:45.118 --> 40:47.313
Oh, right.

40:49.122 --> 40:52.683
Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,
do we? He could play Tinker Bell.

40:53.176 --> 40:57.078
Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.
It moves around the stage.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.649
Just a wee light
that moves around the stage.

41:02.553 --> 41:04.680
Bit worried about this.

41:05.055 --> 41:08.718
Let's see.
We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,

41:08.719 --> 41:11.652
Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.

41:12.062 --> 41:16.226
It's a play for puppets.
Tootles, Nibs, Curly.

41:16.567 --> 41:19.161
All these names are absurd
when you see them all together.

41:19.162 --> 41:21.264
Captain Hook, S...

41:22.072 --> 41:25.200
Oh, hello, James.

41:26.577 --> 41:28.101
You're out of your mind.

41:40.591 --> 41:42.923
How were rehearsals?

41:43.093 --> 41:48.554
Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.

41:48.598 --> 41:51.965
- Good.
- Yes. Thank you.

42:30.107 --> 42:33.508
- Hello.
- Hello.

42:34.061 --> 42:38.430
- How was your journey?
- It was quite long. I'm exhausted.

42:38.649 --> 42:42.585
- Let's get you some tea.
- That'd be nice. Thanks.

42:43.654 --> 42:48.619
- Can you come to the playhouse?
- In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.

42:48.620 --> 42:53.585
But I said I'd get him. They always
send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.

42:53.880 --> 42:57.917
- It will spoil the surprise.
- What surprise, darling?

42:57.918 --> 43:02.617
It's a great surprise. We've taken
most of the day preparing for it.

43:02.973 --> 43:07.235
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

43:07.236 --> 43:11.497
Please don't tell them that I told you
the surprise. I said I wouldn't.

43:11.598 --> 43:13.463
Oh, well, you didn't really tell us
anything about it, did you?

43:13.464 --> 43:17.393
- Yes I did. It's a play.
- It's a play?

43:29.416 --> 43:32.317
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

43:32.335 --> 43:35.600
"A play in one act
by Peter Llewelyn Davies."

43:38.258 --> 43:42.456
- This is just a bit of silliness, really.
- I should hope so. Go on.

43:42.629 --> 43:45.063
I just wanted to take a stab at writing,
you know.

43:45.265 --> 43:47.825
Well, the others do
a good job with it anyway.

43:47.851 --> 43:50.012
Well, let's see it then.

43:52.222 --> 43:55.817
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

43:56.226 --> 43:58.227
"One morning, just after sunrise,

43:58.228 --> 44:01.755
Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter
of Lord and Lady Dubon,

44:01.982 --> 44:07.249
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."

44:07.571 --> 44:10.337
"Suddenly, as she reached
the cathedral doors,

44:10.338 --> 44:13.103
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure

44:13.376 --> 44:16.004
came to life and swooped down upon her."

44:18.331 --> 44:20.561
"The people of the village all ran to safety,

44:20.584 --> 44:23.385
but Lady Ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps

44:23.386 --> 44:27.550
and the gargoyle descended upon her,
wrapping her in its huge wings

44:27.891 --> 44:32.191
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral."

44:32.429 --> 44:35.762
- Go on, Peter.
- "Not long after this sorrowful event,

44:35.932 --> 44:40.596
a young knight named JM Barnaby
came into the city."

44:41.271 --> 44:43.535
Sylvia.

44:43.907 --> 44:46.273
- Do you want some water?
- Mother?

44:46.409 --> 44:49.867
- No, James.
- Let's get her back to the house. Go on.

44:53.500 --> 44:57.596
She won't discuss it with me at all.
She claims it was nothing.

44:57.597 --> 45:00.506
I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.

45:00.507 --> 45:04.034
You can't very well treat a patient
who won't admit there's anything wrong.

45:04.511 --> 45:07.969
Well, you'll have to make her understand
that something is.

45:08.014 --> 45:11.780
- I'll try and do my best.
- Great. Just there.

45:42.549 --> 45:44.847
Get your hand flat like that.

45:46.002 --> 45:47.936
Ow.

45:49.005 --> 45:51.235
Then... Like that.

46:17.784 --> 46:19.877
Come in.

46:28.795 --> 46:32.526
The good doctor didn't feel
up to the challenge on this one.

46:32.799 --> 46:36.326
He thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests.

46:36.327 --> 46:39.795
Nonsense.
When would I have time for that?

46:39.806 --> 46:44.038
Besides, this family's
had enough of hospitals.

46:45.312 --> 46:48.873
- Perhaps they can help you.
- I know what they can do for me.

46:49.316 --> 46:52.318
I saw what they did for my husband.

46:52.319 --> 46:55.618
No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.

46:56.823 --> 46:59.417
I'm keenly interested
in having some supper.

47:29.189 --> 47:33.649
What did you and Mother decide
to tell us this time? "It's only a chest cold"?

47:34.110 --> 47:36.578
- We hadn't decided anything.
- Stop lying to me!

47:36.579 --> 47:39.727
I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.868
I'm not lying to you.
I don't know what's wrong.

47:42.869 --> 47:47.363
"Father might take us fishing,"
that's what she said. "In just a few weeks."

47:47.707 --> 47:50.162
And he died the next morning.

47:50.163 --> 47:52.618
That wasn't a lie, Peter.

47:52.879 --> 47:53.879
That was your mother's hope.

47:53.880 --> 47:58.283
He barely moved for a week,
but I started planning our fishing trip.

47:58.435 --> 48:02.496
I will never lie to you. I promise you that.

48:02.605 --> 48:06.166
No, all you'll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories

48:06.443 --> 48:10.971
and pretend that things
aren't happening until...

48:14.451 --> 48:16.851
I won't! I'm not blind.

48:17.070 --> 48:19.595
I won't be made a fool.

48:20.407 --> 48:23.433
What's this? Peter.

48:23.793 --> 48:25.886
The play.

48:26.379 --> 48:29.678
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.

48:31.384 --> 48:34.842
Magic's gone out of it a bit now,
hasn't it?

48:35.338 --> 48:38.102
All because of a silly chest cold.

49:22.385 --> 49:24.285
James.

49:26.389 --> 49:28.755
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,
don't you?

49:28.892 --> 49:29.892
Good evening.

49:29.893 --> 49:36.093
Mr Cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship.

49:36.399 --> 49:38.890
I know how involved you've been as well.

49:38.902 --> 49:44.169
He wanted to speak to you.
I did think you'd be home so much sooner.

49:44.407 --> 49:47.001
It's been a long evening, Mary.

49:47.911 --> 49:49.845
Yes.

49:49.913 --> 49:52.414
Well, if I'd realized how late it was,
of course.

49:52.415 --> 49:55.646
I should perhaps talk to you
at another time? Not so late?

49:55.919 --> 49:57.978
That will be fine.

50:00.423 --> 50:02.424
We'll talk then.

50:02.425 --> 50:05.292
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.

50:05.428 --> 50:07.157
Mr Barrie.

50:07.430 --> 50:09.557
- Good night.
- Night.

50:26.583 --> 50:29.614
Well, aren't you going to speak?

50:29.615 --> 50:32.646
What would you like me to say?

50:33.456 --> 50:36.857
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"
I suppose.

50:36.960 --> 50:40.452
And then, let's see. What comes next?

50:42.465 --> 50:45.434
"No later than you were out, James."

50:45.468 --> 50:48.266
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening?"

50:49.222 --> 50:51.588
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer
for that one, wouldn't I?

50:51.589 --> 50:53.317
How dare you.

50:55.812 --> 50:58.178
This isn't one of your plays.

50:58.314 --> 51:02.080
I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.

51:04.537 --> 51:07.734
But I'm not ready for this conversation,
wherever it may lead.

51:08.041 --> 51:13.001
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
Good night then.

52:35.995 --> 52:40.414
Mr Barrie. Don't you agree
this is a little bit tight?

52:40.415 --> 52:44.834
- No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.
- Baggy?

52:45.004 --> 52:47.700
Quite frumpy. I'd bring it
right in just there.

52:47.807 --> 52:49.399
That's very tight.

52:49.809 --> 52:52.243
And put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up.

52:52.312 --> 52:54.280
- Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.
- Plank of wood?

52:54.314 --> 52:56.714
Some wood there on the shoulders as well.

52:56.816 --> 53:00.684
- Otherwise, it's marvelous.
- Right, sir.

53:12.949 --> 53:15.850
- You'll be sick tomorrow.
- I'll be sick tonight.

53:19.922 --> 53:22.322
James.

53:22.425 --> 53:26.225
We're just having some tea.
You remember my mother, of course.

53:26.429 --> 53:29.592
Yes. Of course. How do you do?

53:31.884 --> 53:35.820
- May I take your hat?
- That's enough, boys.

53:39.192 --> 53:41.660
Boys, please don't run in the house.
You'll break something.

53:41.978 --> 53:44.003
Come away from that door.
Come on, come on.

53:44.063 --> 53:47.328
- I'd like a word with you,
Mr Barrie, before you go.

53:47.329 --> 53:49.330
We'll only be a few minutes.

53:49.786 --> 53:52.050
Boys, why don't you go
and play in the garden? Go on.

53:52.051 --> 53:53.634
- Is he in trouble?
- Sh.

53:54.040 --> 53:57.976
Because I've been alone with Grandmother
and I know what it's like.

53:58.044 --> 54:02.140
- Should we retire into the study?
- Why don't you join them, dear?

54:02.141 --> 54:03.890
Very well.

54:06.085 --> 54:09.521
- I do apologize for interrupting.
- Would you close the door, please?

54:09.672 --> 54:11.173
Certainly.

54:11.174 --> 54:16.237
Sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff.

54:16.238 --> 54:20.445
- Well, not exactly.
- That won't be necessary.

54:20.817 --> 54:23.012
I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.

54:23.686 --> 54:25.771
You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.

54:25.772 --> 54:28.824
You see, I'm moving in here from now on.

54:28.825 --> 54:33.455
- You're moving in?
- I'm going where I'm most needed.

54:33.696 --> 54:36.358
And I can certainly see to it
that this house is managed

54:36.582 --> 54:38.914
without resorting to your charity.

54:38.951 --> 54:43.580
It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.
I was only trying to help, as a friend.

54:43.581 --> 54:48.209
Have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter?

54:48.344 --> 54:51.108
Or are you really that selfish?

54:51.297 --> 54:53.925
I beg your pardon?

54:54.183 --> 54:58.279
Don't you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man

54:58.280 --> 55:01.418
does for a widow's future prospects?

55:02.975 --> 55:07.002
Sylvia needs to find someone.
The boys need a father.

55:09.899 --> 55:14.336
And you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again.

55:14.370 --> 55:18.204
I have only wanted good things
for this family, Mrs du Maurier.

55:18.205 --> 55:20.702
I'll look after them.

55:22.044 --> 55:24.911
You have your own family
to concern yourself with.

55:24.914 --> 55:26.711
What are you suggesting?

55:26.716 --> 55:30.709
I'm suggesting that you protect
what you have, Mr Barrie.

55:31.003 --> 55:34.769
That is precisely what I am doing.

55:56.913 --> 56:00.610
I was so certain what I would find in this.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.733
Some little confession
would leak out onto the page.

56:05.955 --> 56:08.389
I don't write love notes in my journal.

56:08.424 --> 56:10.858
No.

56:11.010 --> 56:14.468
Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you?

56:14.514 --> 56:17.244
That's some comfort, actually.

56:18.100 --> 56:20.830
It means I know you just a little after all.

56:20.853 --> 56:24.550
You needn't steal my journal
to get to know me, Mary.

56:24.640 --> 56:29.168
No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.

56:31.614 --> 56:36.415
I was hopelessly naive when I married you.

56:37.453 --> 56:42.948
I imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place

56:42.949 --> 56:46.990
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn.

56:47.547 --> 56:52.280
And I hoped, at least once...

56:53.636 --> 56:56.571
you would take me there with you.

56:56.639 --> 56:59.631
There is no such place.

57:01.093 --> 57:03.220
Yes, there is.

57:04.764 --> 57:06.857
Neverland.

57:09.235 --> 57:11.903
It's the best you've written, James.

57:11.904 --> 57:15.931
And I'm sure the Davies will adore
the world you've created for them.

57:16.359 --> 57:19.453
I only wish I were part of it.

57:20.363 --> 57:23.992
I've wanted you to be. I've tried.

57:27.620 --> 57:29.120
Mary.

57:29.121 --> 57:34.024
I always imagined us going off on
great adventures once we were together.

57:34.126 --> 57:37.653
But we moved into this house
and you started, I don't know,

57:38.130 --> 57:41.998
- you started rearranging the furniture.
- What was I supposed to do, James?

57:42.134 --> 57:43.431
You were always gone.

57:43.432 --> 57:44.728
I was right here.

57:45.137 --> 57:52.134
Sitting in your parlor, staring off
into other worlds as though I didn't exist.

57:53.062 --> 57:55.724
Look. Just give me bit more time
to finish up the play.

57:55.815 --> 57:57.749
To spend with your muse?

57:57.817 --> 58:03.380
No, I'm tired of waiting, James.
I'm tired of looking like a fool.

58:04.657 --> 58:08.024
Well, I can't very well give up the play.

58:09.128 --> 58:11.756
Of course not.

58:12.081 --> 58:17.542
Just come home to me at the end of
the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.

58:17.753 --> 58:22.713
No more trips to the country,
no more long afternoons in the park.

58:22.714 --> 58:26.885
If you can't give us that much of a chance,

58:27.313 --> 58:30.282
then we must end this.

58:31.067 --> 58:33.934
And I will.

58:38.991 --> 58:41.516
Pitiful display.

58:46.999 --> 58:49.160
Nanny. Nanny.

58:49.161 --> 58:51.595
What?

58:54.006 --> 58:57.373
First you get the pajamas,
then you make the bed.

58:57.374 --> 58:59.420
With my paws?

58:59.762 --> 59:03.823
You make the bed with your paws.
The pajamas you get with your teeth.

59:03.824 --> 59:07.884
Because in fact, being a dog,
you haven't any proper digits, have you?

59:08.854 --> 59:11.385
Well, I don't have any teeth, either.

59:11.386 --> 59:13.917
I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.

59:14.226 --> 59:17.354
All I've got is this rubbery snout.

59:20.232 --> 59:24.328
- Can we get him some teeth?
- He can have mine.

59:24.329 --> 59:26.466
We'll get you teeth.

59:26.739 --> 59:30.197
- Let's have a wee break, shall we?
- Right.

59:33.045 --> 59:34.512
- I thought you were wonderful.
- You were marvelous.

59:34.964 --> 59:36.989
I think you're better on four legs
than you are on two.

59:36.990 --> 59:39.491
- Oh, give it a rest.
- I do.

59:40.970 --> 59:44.303
- Just say it, Charles, go on.
- Well, you picture it, James.

59:44.304 --> 59:47.636
Opening night, doctors, lawyers,
businessmen and their wives,

59:47.977 --> 59:49.444
all dressed to the nines.

59:49.478 --> 59:54.130
They've paid good money, they're
expecting theater, what we call theater.

59:54.131 --> 59:58.783
The curtain opens and it's crocodiles
and fairies and pirates and lndians.

59:58.988 --> 01:00:02.389
I don't even know what it is.

01:00:02.491 --> 01:00:06.825
But you did know, Charles. You're
an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.

01:00:06.946 --> 01:00:08.846
Oh, don't patronize me, James.

01:00:08.948 --> 01:00:12.008
You know how much money I put into
this show that I haven't even found yet?

01:00:12.284 --> 01:00:15.447
Listen, listen. Opening night,
I want 25 seats set aside.

01:00:15.448 --> 01:00:17.288
- Set aside? 25?
- 25 seats.

01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:19.985
Scattered throughout the theater.
Two here, two there, three up there.

01:00:20.292 --> 01:00:22.260
- Are they paying for it?
- They're filled.

01:00:22.261 --> 01:00:24.695
- No, no, no. I'm asking...
- The seats are filled.

01:00:24.764 --> 01:00:27.358
- Uncle Jim?
- Hello, boys.

01:00:27.767 --> 01:00:29.064
Could I speak to you for a moment,
please?

01:00:29.065 --> 01:00:30.497
Certainly.

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.796
25 seats, Charles. It'll be great.
It'll be fantastic.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.365
25 scattered seats?
Who's paying for them?

01:00:35.366 --> 01:00:36.298
Throughout the theater.

01:00:36.776 --> 01:00:40.268
- Who's paying for these 25 seats?
- They're filled-up seats, Charles.

01:00:40.279 --> 01:00:42.280
Whoa. Look.

01:00:42.281 --> 01:00:45.045
This is great. I'm flying.

01:00:45.151 --> 01:00:49.485
We don't need to use much pull at all, see?
As long as we've got the balance down.

01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:52.257
Mother asked me to take the boys out
for the afternoon.

01:00:52.374 --> 01:00:54.876
She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,

01:00:54.877 --> 01:00:59.246
but she was trembling so badly
she couldn't even finish her tea.

01:00:59.298 --> 01:01:02.461
I'm not a fool, Uncle James.
I deserve to know the truth.

01:01:02.668 --> 01:01:06.035
I don't know the truth.
She won't talk about it.

01:01:06.036 --> 01:01:08.448
But you think it's serious?

01:01:10.559 --> 01:01:13.426
It could be. The doctor felt
she should go and have some tests.

01:01:13.562 --> 01:01:15.393
Then you'll have to convince her
to go then.

01:01:15.564 --> 01:01:17.964
I've tried. She won't listen to me.

01:01:19.151 --> 01:01:20.151
And lately, to be quite honest,

01:01:20.152 --> 01:01:24.885
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm.

01:01:25.157 --> 01:01:27.421
Apparently I've made
quite a mess of things.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.857
It's Grandmother, isn't it?
She's run you off, hasn't she?

01:01:30.863 --> 01:01:36.062
Oh, she's absolutely tried with great
effort. And perhaps with good reason.

01:01:36.063 --> 01:01:39.454
It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...

01:01:39.455 --> 01:01:43.824
She just doesn't want
to see Mother hurt anymore.

01:01:47.346 --> 01:01:50.281
Look at that.

01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:53.011
How magnificent.

01:01:54.053 --> 01:01:56.146
The boy's gone.

01:01:58.557 --> 01:02:03.075
Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,
you've become a grown-up.

01:02:03.076 --> 01:02:07.593
Right then. I think you should be the one
to talk to her, George.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:13.702
- But I wouldn't know what to say.
- You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.

01:02:13.706 --> 01:02:16.708
Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

01:02:16.709 --> 01:02:20.873
- It's Nana, he's expired backstage.
- What's happened?

01:02:21.213 --> 01:02:23.943
I think his costume is too tight.

01:02:24.216 --> 01:02:29.620
It's not possible, too tight.
George, give me a minute, I'll be back.

01:02:33.008 --> 01:02:37.707
Pull that one tight.
Here, last one.

01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:41.581
OK. Flap those wings.

01:02:41.582 --> 01:02:43.731
- There you go.
- Whoa!

01:02:44.603 --> 01:02:47.071
- Can I have a go?
- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

01:02:47.106 --> 01:02:48.573
Give that a tug. Go on.

01:02:48.607 --> 01:02:50.973
- Just give it a little pull.
- Can I have a go?

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:52.509
- In a minute. In a minute.
- Can I have a go?

01:02:52.611 --> 01:02:54.602
- Jack. Pull me higher.
- I have to concentrate.

01:02:54.613 --> 01:02:56.240
- Stop it now, boys.
- No, Michael.

01:02:56.448 --> 01:02:57.949
Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.

01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:59.918
- I want to do it now.
- No, don't go down there.

01:03:00.336 --> 01:03:01.530
What are you...?

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:05.882
Ow!

01:03:10.129 --> 01:03:12.819
Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.509
- I'm so sorry.
- George?

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.039
Mr Barrie?

01:03:23.142 --> 01:03:26.771
Mrs Davies would like a word with you.

01:03:27.062 --> 01:03:29.394
No, just Mr Barrie.

01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:50.933
- Did you encourage this?
- Encourage what?

01:03:51.003 --> 01:03:55.167
Oh, James, please.
You know perfectly well what.

01:03:56.008 --> 01:04:02.277
George won't allow them to set his arm
unless I submit to an examination.

01:04:03.766 --> 01:04:06.929
I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,

01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:12.366
because he's quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it.

01:04:12.524 --> 01:04:17.325
This is absurd.
They won't tell me anything different.

01:04:17.326 --> 01:04:19.497
Different?

01:04:19.531 --> 01:04:22.125
So you've already spoken to a doctor then?

01:04:22.534 --> 01:04:25.298
That is not your concern.

01:04:30.926 --> 01:04:35.192
My understanding is that my condition
may be quite serious.

01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:40.232
However... my wish is that
life should go on as normal.

01:04:41.186 --> 01:04:42.676
So,

01:04:43.188 --> 01:04:45.690
I'll have the examination,

01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:48.819
and I'll take whatever medications
they advise.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.527
But I don't want to know what they're for.

01:04:51.697 --> 01:04:55.793
And I don't want you inquiring into it
any further.

01:04:56.702 --> 01:04:59.068
Wouldn't dream of it.

01:05:17.806 --> 01:05:19.899
Mary?

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.074
Mary?

01:05:45.167 --> 01:05:48.068
Peter, could you help George
to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?

01:05:48.253 --> 01:05:51.552
- They're in the linen cupboard. Darling?
- Yes, Mother.

01:05:51.553 --> 01:05:55.352
Jack, how do you manage
to always come untucked?

01:05:55.594 --> 01:05:57.789
Would you check your shirt-tails
in the intermission, please?

01:05:58.097 --> 01:05:59.325
Yes, Mother.

01:05:59.598 --> 01:06:02.032
You're not planning on attending
any after-theater events, are you?

01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:05.798
Only for a short time if we do. The tickets!

01:06:05.804 --> 01:06:07.805
- With the children?
- George!

01:06:07.806 --> 01:06:11.036
Um, possibly. Would you see
if George has the tickets, please?

01:06:11.037 --> 01:06:14.267
- I'll just check the dressing table.
- Sylvia, there's a...

01:06:14.813 --> 01:06:19.375
Mother, please see if George has
the tickets. Michael, where are your socks?

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.650
Wait here, don't move.

01:06:56.271 --> 01:06:59.172
Take her feet, George.

01:07:01.326 --> 01:07:03.692
We'll need some more blankets.

01:07:04.913 --> 01:07:07.882
Oh, take Michael with you, would you?

01:07:10.419 --> 01:07:14.651
She looks much worse
than when we were at the cottage.

01:07:14.923 --> 01:07:17.925
Sh, Michael.

01:07:17.926 --> 01:07:20.918
- Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
- No, sir. Not yet.

01:07:20.929 --> 01:07:23.397
Precisely. Have there been
many people asking for seats?

01:07:23.932 --> 01:07:24.921
- Yes, sir.
- Charles.

01:07:24.933 --> 01:07:26.992
I suggest you start selling them.
Yes, James?

01:07:27.102 --> 01:07:28.899
Have you seen any of the Davies family
yet this evening?

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:29.901
The 25 seats, are they filled?

01:07:30.105 --> 01:07:31.800
- It's taken care of.
- Yes. Yes.

01:07:32.107 --> 01:07:35.167
Who did you invite? Because obviously
whoever you invited decided not to come.

01:07:35.194 --> 01:07:37.754
- The seats will be filled, I promise.
- Yes. You've been promising me all...

01:07:37.755 --> 01:07:39.323
- Charles?
- Hello, Mr Stanley.

01:07:39.698 --> 01:07:41.427
Have you seen the Davies family
this evening?

01:07:41.428 --> 01:07:42.189
No, sir.

01:07:43.035 --> 01:07:46.266
- Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.
- Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.

01:07:46.267 --> 01:07:48.131
Yes, you do, dear.

01:07:50.042 --> 01:07:53.102
I think I'll get some camomile
to help you relax.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:57.038
Peter will be here if you need anything.

01:08:03.055 --> 01:08:04.716
Peter.

01:08:05.057 --> 01:08:07.116
Peter.

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.432
Can I do anything, Mother?

01:08:17.603 --> 01:08:19.696
No, darling.

01:08:21.106 --> 01:08:23.438
You must go to the play.

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:28.706
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

01:08:28.707 --> 01:08:31.139
I need you to.

01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:36.319
I need you to come back tonight
and tell me every bit of it.

01:08:36.455 --> 01:08:37.955
Please.

01:08:37.956 --> 01:08:41.015
It's only a play, Mother.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:43.859
It doesn't matter.

01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:50.613
What do you want?

01:08:50.852 --> 01:08:53.649
Take it out.

01:08:55.857 --> 01:08:58.621
Open it.

01:09:07.703 --> 01:09:11.036
I've never been so proud of you.

01:09:24.386 --> 01:09:27.287
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Last call.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:30.165
Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.

01:09:30.425 --> 01:09:34.156
We had time to sell those 25 seats.
The play's starting.

01:09:46.441 --> 01:09:47.441
- Charles.
- What?

01:09:47.442 --> 01:09:51.401
- They're here.
- Who's here?

01:09:54.449 --> 01:09:58.044
Do forgive them being a bit late -
short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

01:09:58.045 --> 01:10:00.183
I'm not clear what they're doing here.

01:10:00.455 --> 01:10:02.047
- They've come to see the play.
- Mm-hm.

01:10:02.048 --> 01:10:03.857
- That's the 25 seats.
- Mm.

01:10:03.959 --> 01:10:08.123
25 seats given to orphans. Right.
Now my nightmare is complete.

01:10:08.463 --> 01:10:10.522
You can start your play now.

01:10:10.523 --> 01:10:12.524
Your play.

01:10:17.522 --> 01:10:20.491
Get them in the scattered seats.

01:10:35.624 --> 01:10:38.752
Just there, boys.

01:11:10.192 --> 01:11:13.286
Excuse me, sir. This way.

01:11:13.287 --> 01:11:15.254
Thank you.

01:11:15.697 --> 01:11:18.791
Looks like we got
one of the better-dressed ones.

01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:23.661
I just want you to know,
I think you're a wonderful dog.

01:11:23.705 --> 01:11:25.935
Thanks.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.536
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

01:12:29.537 --> 01:12:31.018
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:33.574
Two minutes more.

01:12:33.575 --> 01:12:36.009
Please. One minute more.

01:12:36.361 --> 01:12:41.162
Nana, I will not be bathed.
I tell you, I will not be bathed.

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:48.765
Who are you?

01:12:55.347 --> 01:13:00.046
No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.

01:13:00.852 --> 01:13:03.286
My children.

01:13:04.606 --> 01:13:07.905
- How is she?
- She's resting.

01:13:08.109 --> 01:13:09.977
- May I see her?
- No, Mr Barrie.

01:13:09.978 --> 01:13:12.970
I don't think we need to include you in
everything that goes on in this household.

01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:15.426
- But she'd want to see him.
- Be quiet, George.

01:13:15.427 --> 01:13:16.534
And since, as I've discovered,

01:13:16.535 --> 01:13:20.528
you've seen fit to conceal certain facts
about my daughter's condition from me,

01:13:20.872 --> 01:13:23.864
I feel no remorse at excluding you
from my home.

01:13:23.865 --> 01:13:24.784
But you can't...

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.687
- Go upstairs, George, now.
- Stop ordering me about.

01:13:28.688 --> 01:13:30.858
This isn't your home. It's our home.

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:33.134
Just cos Mother's
needed your help recently

01:13:33.168 --> 01:13:35.432
doesn't give you the right
to rule over her existence.

01:13:35.433 --> 01:13:37.832
She's not a child anymore,
and neither am I.

01:13:38.139 --> 01:13:40.539
If she wants to see Uncle Jim,
she can see Uncle Jim.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.603
There's nothing you can do about it.

01:13:47.432 --> 01:13:50.526
- Mother?
- Yes, darling?

01:13:52.938 --> 01:13:55.439
James.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.204
No. Your play.

01:14:00.946 --> 01:14:03.948
Look at all this.

01:14:03.949 --> 01:14:06.247
I'd have come tonight, it's just...

01:14:06.451 --> 01:14:09.579
- Mother, you need to rest.
- I still have things to do here.

01:14:10.505 --> 01:14:13.507
See? This needs mending.

01:14:13.508 --> 01:14:17.035
Four boys, no end of patches.

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:19.845
Can't seem to keep up.

01:14:20.966 --> 01:14:23.799
I haven't the time for all this.

01:14:24.603 --> 01:14:30.473
Don't look at me like that, James.
You make me feel so utterly exposed.

01:14:32.277 --> 01:14:37.772
Boys, would you give me a moment
with your mother, please? Thank you.

01:14:57.552 --> 01:15:00.282
They can see it, you know.

01:15:01.556 --> 01:15:03.956
You can't go on just pretending.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:07.995
"Just pretending"?

01:15:10.065 --> 01:15:14.001
You brought pretending
into this family, James.

01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:18.630
You showed us we can change things
by simply believing them to be different.

01:15:18.631 --> 01:15:21.064
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.

01:15:21.076 --> 01:15:24.307
But the things that matter.

01:15:25.363 --> 01:15:31.927
We've pretended for some time now
that you're a part of this family, haven't we?

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:44.008
You've come to mean so much to us all
that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:49.751
And even if it isn't true,

01:15:50.605 --> 01:15:53.574
even if that can never be...

01:15:56.111 --> 01:15:59.046
I need to go on pretending.

01:16:01.116 --> 01:16:03.243
Until the end.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.713
With you.

01:16:08.623 --> 01:16:12.957
- Oh, I am sweet.
- How do you do it?

01:16:13.294 --> 01:16:17.856
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts
and they lift you up in the air.

01:16:20.752 --> 01:16:26.281
You are so nippy at it.
Couldn't you do it very slowly once?

01:16:30.178 --> 01:16:34.114
Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.

01:16:34.182 --> 01:16:37.481
I must blow fairy dust on you first.

01:16:47.162 --> 01:16:49.687
Now try. Try it from the beds.

01:16:50.248 --> 01:16:54.184
Just wriggle your shoulders like this
and then let go.

01:16:55.837 --> 01:16:59.000
- I flew!
- How ripping!

01:16:59.541 --> 01:17:01.566
Now join hands.

01:17:05.597 --> 01:17:08.464
- Look at me!
- I do like it!

01:17:10.552 --> 01:17:13.851
- Bravo!
- Let's go out.

01:17:14.189 --> 01:17:18.125
Second on the right
and straight on till morning.

01:17:18.193 --> 01:17:20.491
Genius.

01:17:24.315 --> 01:17:29.184
- Sylvia, don't move.
- I feel a little better.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.949
It's been a bad day, that's all.

01:17:34.325 --> 01:17:37.294
Now I want you to go back to the theater.

01:17:37.328 --> 01:17:39.830
Find Peter.

01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:43.892
- Of course.
- Thank you.

01:17:47.338 --> 01:17:51.468
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can do for you?

01:17:52.343 --> 01:17:54.436
No.

01:17:56.347 --> 01:17:57.848
Well,

01:17:57.849 --> 01:18:01.080
I have always wanted to go to Neverland.

01:18:01.519 --> 01:18:04.579
You did promise to tell me about it,
you know.

01:18:05.106 --> 01:18:08.098
Aye. That I did.

01:18:09.244 --> 01:18:12.680
It's a bit late for it
tonight though, I'm afraid.

01:18:14.282 --> 01:18:17.740
Perhaps some time soon though?

01:18:24.676 --> 01:18:27.177
Most definitely.

01:18:27.178 --> 01:18:32.411
- D'you mean we shall both be drowned?
- Look how the water is rising.

01:18:35.687 --> 01:18:39.189
It must be the tail of the kite
we made for Michael.

01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:44.526
You remember. It tore itself
out of his hands and floated away.

01:18:45.697 --> 01:18:50.259
- The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you?
- Both of us.

01:18:51.202 --> 01:18:54.535
It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.

01:18:54.536 --> 01:18:57.299
I won't go without you, Peter.

01:18:57.709 --> 01:19:00.269
Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:03.203
And you a lady? Never.

01:19:06.217 --> 01:19:07.775
Ready, Wendy?

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:09.687
Peter!

01:19:09.721 --> 01:19:12.189
Don't let go, Wendy.

01:19:12.223 --> 01:19:14.691
Peter, I'm frightened.

01:19:14.726 --> 01:19:17.593
Hang on, Wendy!

01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:20.731
Peter!

01:19:20.732 --> 01:19:24.566
To die will be an awfully big adventure.

01:19:41.002 --> 01:19:43.562
- I'm glad you came.
- Well...

01:19:45.006 --> 01:19:48.635
I've never missed an opening.

01:19:48.636 --> 01:19:50.602
So I...

01:19:51.512 --> 01:19:54.538
assume you heard about Gilbert and I.

01:19:54.539 --> 01:19:56.415
Yes.

01:19:57.518 --> 01:19:59.850
Quite the scandal, so I'm told.

01:20:07.528 --> 01:20:10.258
How are you?

01:20:14.535 --> 01:20:17.402
I'm all right.

01:20:17.538 --> 01:20:20.029
How are you?

01:20:21.042 --> 01:20:23.772
I'm sorry.

01:20:26.547 --> 01:20:29.243
Don't be.

01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:34.715
Without that family, you could
never have written anything like this.

01:20:34.716 --> 01:20:37.149
You need them.

01:20:44.065 --> 01:20:46.898
Goodbye.

01:20:58.196 --> 01:21:00.528
- Mr Barrie.
- Mrs Snow.

01:21:01.199 --> 01:21:05.067
Thank you. That was quite the nicest
evening I've ever spent in the theater.

01:21:05.068 --> 01:21:08.297
Very kind of you to say. Thank you.
Where's Mr Snow this evening?

01:21:08.706 --> 01:21:09.706
Oh.

01:21:09.707 --> 01:21:12.574
I'm afraid he's left us.

01:21:12.710 --> 01:21:15.702
And he would so have loved this evening.

01:21:15.713 --> 01:21:18.204
The pirates and the lndians.

01:21:18.716 --> 01:21:22.584
He was really just a boy himself, you know.

01:21:22.585 --> 01:21:24.950
To the very end.

01:21:25.223 --> 01:21:28.488
I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing?

01:21:28.726 --> 01:21:32.612
I'm doing well enough now, thank you.

01:21:32.613 --> 01:21:37.880
I suppose it's all the work
of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?

01:21:38.403 --> 01:21:43.136
Time is chasing after all of us.
Isn't that right?

01:21:44.158 --> 01:21:47.150
- That's right, Mrs Snow.
- Aunt Rose, your drink.

01:21:47.161 --> 01:21:50.619
Thank you. I mustn't keep you.
You've a lot of friends here.

01:21:50.665 --> 01:21:54.192
Well, it's lovely to see you.
I'm terribly sorry, once again.

01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:59.504
- Was that Mr Barrie?
- That was Mr Barrie.

01:21:59.674 --> 01:22:02.438
Well done, Mr Barrie.

01:22:02.677 --> 01:22:05.510
- Good show.
- Well done.

01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:11.683
Psst.

01:22:11.903 --> 01:22:13.996
What did you think?

01:22:14.489 --> 01:22:17.458
- It's about our summer together, isn't it?
- It is.

01:22:17.492 --> 01:22:19.687
- About all of us.
- That's right.

01:22:21.496 --> 01:22:24.192
Did you like it?

01:22:24.499 --> 01:22:27.195
It's magical. Thank you.

01:22:27.502 --> 01:22:29.902
Oh, thank you.

01:22:30.004 --> 01:22:31.801
Thank you, Peter.

01:22:32.006 --> 01:22:36.102
- This is Peter Pan! How wonderful.
- Really?

01:22:36.511 --> 01:22:39.969
You're Peter Pan? Why, you must be
quite the little adventurer.

01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:43.161
Look, it's true.
He has no shadow.

01:22:44.469 --> 01:22:46.960
But I'm not Peter Pan.

01:22:47.138 --> 01:22:49.572
He is.

01:22:59.984 --> 01:23:04.648
And there's been no improvement
since my last visit?

01:23:04.649 --> 01:23:06.548
No.

01:23:11.913 --> 01:23:15.371
Has James been by at all today, Mother?

01:23:17.835 --> 01:23:20.099
Dr Brighton. May I have a word?

01:23:21.756 --> 01:23:24.452
Excuse me a moment.

01:23:28.896 --> 01:23:32.354
You haven't been keeping him from me,
have you?

01:23:32.433 --> 01:23:34.663
As a matter of fact,
I actually hoped he might come.

01:23:34.664 --> 01:23:37.488
Would have proved me wrong about him.

01:23:37.522 --> 01:23:39.387
Of course, with the success of his play,

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.801
the whole of London
must be knocking at his door.

01:23:47.448 --> 01:23:49.609
I'm sorry, dear.

01:23:53.454 --> 01:23:56.456
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

01:23:56.457 --> 01:23:59.517
- Quiet, Michael.
- I didn't say anything.

01:23:59.594 --> 01:24:02.188
Mother, could you come downstairs
for a moment?

01:24:02.713 --> 01:24:05.443
Oh, she can't come downstairs.
What are you thinking of, George?

01:24:05.516 --> 01:24:10.044
Actually, I think a trip downstairs
might do her good, ma'am.

01:24:18.896 --> 01:24:22.764
- What have you been up to?
- Just wait and see.

01:24:31.292 --> 01:24:33.210
It's a play.

01:24:33.211 --> 01:24:37.079
It's not just a play, Michael.
It's the play.

01:24:38.249 --> 01:24:41.616
Of course, we'll have to make do
with a few compromises.

01:24:42.253 --> 01:24:44.254
Much of it will have to be imagined.

01:24:44.255 --> 01:24:47.622
- As it should be.
- As it should be, that's right.

01:24:55.566 --> 01:24:59.024
Michael, come and sit here,
next to Mum.

01:25:02.907 --> 01:25:05.341
When you're ready.

01:25:31.385 --> 01:25:33.979
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

01:25:34.272 --> 01:25:39.539
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.
Two minutes more. Please.

01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:43.273
- You know fairies, Peter?
- Yes.

01:25:44.031 --> 01:25:46.522
But they're nearly all dead now.

01:25:46.534 --> 01:25:51.233
You see, Wendy, when the first baby
laughed for the first time,

01:25:51.539 --> 01:25:55.669
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about

01:25:55.826 --> 01:25:57.827
and that was the beginning of fairies.

01:25:57.828 --> 01:26:03.266
And now when every new baby is born,
its first laugh becomes a fairy.

01:26:03.334 --> 01:26:06.633
So there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl.

01:26:06.837 --> 01:26:09.931
- Ought to be? Isn't there?
- Oh, no.

01:26:10.007 --> 01:26:14.569
Children know such a lot now.
Soon, they don't believe in fairies.

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:18.175
And every time a child says,
"I don't believe in fairies,"

01:26:18.432 --> 01:26:21.663
there's a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead.

01:26:25.323 --> 01:26:28.417
Who is that?

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:32.488
The redskins were defeated?

01:26:32.947 --> 01:26:37.008
Wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates?

01:26:37.084 --> 01:26:39.985
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her!

01:26:42.123 --> 01:26:44.853
Oh, that's just my medicine.

01:26:45.292 --> 01:26:49.319
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?

01:26:51.382 --> 01:26:55.079
Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.

01:26:57.188 --> 01:27:00.157
It was poisoned.

01:27:01.192 --> 01:27:04.525
And you drank it to save my life?

01:27:06.397 --> 01:27:08.558
Tink.

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.733
Are you dying?

01:27:16.741 --> 01:27:19.175
Her light is growing faint.

01:27:20.745 --> 01:27:24.738
If it goes out, that means she's dead.

01:27:26.967 --> 01:27:30.664
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear
what she's saying.

01:27:30.665 --> 01:27:34.430
She says she thinks
she could get well again

01:27:34.431 --> 01:27:37.208
if children believed in fairies.

01:27:43.851 --> 01:27:46.820
Do you believe in fairies?

01:27:48.322 --> 01:27:51.587
Say quick that you believe.

01:27:54.278 --> 01:27:57.338
If you believe, clap your hands.

01:27:58.999 --> 01:28:02.162
Clap louder.

01:28:07.174 --> 01:28:10.268
Thank you. Thank you.

01:28:53.504 --> 01:28:56.166
That is Neverland.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:22.438
So many perfect days.

01:30:23.644 --> 01:30:28.308
I really began to believe
we'd go on like that forever.

01:30:28.649 --> 01:30:30.900
Oh, stop it.

01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:34.064
She wasn't going to stay with you forever.

01:30:34.905 --> 01:30:38.274
She had a husband. My father.

01:30:38.275 --> 01:30:41.836
She never cared for you
the way she did for him.

01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:46.124
I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.

01:30:46.533 --> 01:30:49.468
I could never do that.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.819
You'd best let him go.

01:31:01.432 --> 01:31:06.631
George, would you take the boys back
to the house? I'll be with you in a moment.

01:31:07.021 --> 01:31:09.080
Go on, dear.

01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:18.657
I'm terribly sorry.

01:31:19.533 --> 01:31:22.969
I've ruined everything I've touched
in this family.

01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:25.572
Stop giving yourself so much credit.

01:31:25.573 --> 01:31:29.873
Peter's grieving.
It has nothing to do with you.

01:31:31.078 --> 01:31:33.478
Perhaps if I just had
a bit more time with him.

01:31:33.581 --> 01:31:36.744
No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.

01:31:37.084 --> 01:31:43.353
If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,
you'd better leave him alone.

01:31:44.842 --> 01:31:48.710
I know you don't much care for me,
Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,

01:31:48.846 --> 01:31:52.509
but I loved your daughter very much.

01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:55.216
And I love those boys.

01:31:55.352 --> 01:31:57.411
And I think they need me right now.

01:31:57.412 --> 01:31:59.355
Is that so?

01:31:59.356 --> 01:32:01.586
And for how long after?

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.827
Meaning what?

01:32:04.828 --> 01:32:10.164
Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship
for the boys in her will.

01:32:10.367 --> 01:32:14.895
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.

01:32:17.374 --> 01:32:22.744
- And what do you have to say about that?
- I shall respect my daughter's wishes.

01:32:22.745 --> 01:32:27.447
Something I should have done more of
while she was alive.

01:32:29.186 --> 01:32:31.154
But if you feel you're not ready
for such a commitment,

01:32:31.188 --> 01:32:36.592
I assure you I can certainly
look after the boys by myself.

01:32:36.694 --> 01:32:39.822
Do you think I could abandon those boys?

01:32:49.206 --> 01:32:51.401
Sit down, Peter.

01:33:11.729 --> 01:33:15.187
Mother pasted it back together

01:33:15.188 --> 01:33:17.314
after I ruined it.

01:33:18.485 --> 01:33:20.486
And then I saw the play.

01:33:20.487 --> 01:33:25.356
I just started writing
and I haven't been able to stop.

01:33:26.994 --> 01:33:30.259
She would be very pleased to know that.

01:33:34.001 --> 01:33:38.233
Listen. I've just spoken
with your grandmother

01:33:39.506 --> 01:33:41.701
and I'm staying.

01:33:41.702 --> 01:33:44.443
For good.

01:33:47.014 --> 01:33:49.608
I'm sorry I was so horrible.

01:33:50.768 --> 01:33:52.827
Don't worry.

01:33:56.273 --> 01:33:59.275
It's just...

01:33:59.276 --> 01:34:02.575
I thought she'd always be here.

01:34:04.448 --> 01:34:06.507
So did I.

01:34:08.452 --> 01:34:10.647
But, in fact...

01:34:13.323 --> 01:34:15.708
she is.

01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:20.874
Because she's on every page
of your imagination.

01:34:22.249 --> 01:34:25.446
You'll always have her there. Always.

01:34:31.225 --> 01:34:34.854
But why did she have to die?

01:34:41.985 --> 01:34:44.249
I don't know, boy.

01:34:48.742 --> 01:34:51.302
When I think of your mother...

01:34:52.246 --> 01:34:55.272
I will always remember
how happy she looked

01:34:55.273 --> 01:34:57.479
sitting there in the parlor,

01:34:57.618 --> 01:35:00.485
watching a play about her family.

01:35:00.504 --> 01:35:04.440
About her boys that never grew up.

01:35:07.711 --> 01:35:10.179
She went to Neverland.

01:35:12.716 --> 01:35:17.619
And you can visit her any time you like

01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:20.588
if you just go there yourself.

01:35:22.726 --> 01:35:25.728
How?

01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:28.892
By believing, Peter.

01:35:28.893 --> 01:35:31.223
Just believe.

01:35:44.548 --> 01:35:46.982
I can see her.
