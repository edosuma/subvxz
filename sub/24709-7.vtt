WEBVTT

00:24.107 --> 00:26.026
I THOUGHT THEY SAID
THE THIRD FLOOR.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.445
THIS <i>IS THE</i>
THIRD FLOOR.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
GETS STEEPER
ALL THE TIME.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.118
OKAY...

00:36.453 --> 00:39.080
HEY, MORNIN', ANDY.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.541
JERRY LEWIS STANDING
GUARD IN THE HALL.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.376
WE GOT ROOMMATES.
UH, BOTH WERE STRANGLED.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.878
IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY WERE RAPED.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.629
THIS IS, UH, MR. LIPMAN.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.966
MR. LIPMAN, THE SUPER,
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.092
HOW'S IT GOING?

00:51.176 --> 00:53.470
YEAH, I LET MYSELF IN
WITH MY OWN KEY.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.971
THE DOG HAD BEEN BARKING,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.806
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR IT
BECAUSE I'M DOWN ON
THE FIRST FLOOR.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.060
BUT I GOT A COMPLAINT
AROUND 4:00 THIS MORNING.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.895
A TENANT UP HERE,

01:01.978 --> 01:04.272
SHE PHONED AND SAID
THE DOG HAD BEEN BARKING
AND HOWLING FOR A LONG TIME.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.734
EVENTUALLY, MR. LIPMAN
HERE COMES UPSTAIRS
AND FINDS THE BODIES.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.362
SO I CALLED UP HERE
AND I DIDN'T GET NO ANSWER,

01:11.446 --> 01:14.741
SO I FIGURED
THE GIRLS HAD GONE OUT
AND THEY LEFT THE DOG.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.452
ON THE BASIS OF THAT,
WHAT WITH THE POSSIBILITY
OF BITING,

01:17.535 --> 01:19.496
I WASN'T ABOUT
TO LET MYSELF IN,

01:19.579 --> 01:21.581
AND THEN DO
WHAT WITH THE DOG?

01:21.664 --> 01:22.957
OK, THANKS VERY MUCH.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.086
SO I WENT BACK TO SLEEP
AND ANOTHER TENANT CALLED,

01:26.169 --> 01:28.505
AND HE SAID THE DOGS
WERE DRIVING HIM CRAZY,

01:28.588 --> 01:31.007
AND HE WENT AND BANGED
ON THE GIRLS' DOOR AND
DIDN'T GET NO ANSWER.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.967
IS THAT WHEN YOU
COME UP AND FOUND THEM?

01:33.051 --> 01:35.011
YEAH, I LET MYSELF IN,
THIS IS WHAT I FOUND.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.513
THIS ONE
RIGHT HERE, ANDY,

01:36.596 --> 01:38.598
THIS IS, UH, ISHANA.
SHE'S BEEN LIVING
HERE 5 MONTHS.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.643
MR. LIPMAN SAYS THAT,
UH, CARLY BACK HERE,

01:41.726 --> 01:43.436
BEEN HERE 14 MONTHS.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.979
NEITHER ONE OF THEM
HAVE BEEN NO TROUBLE.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.649
BUT HE DID NOTICE
A PRETTY MUCH LARGE
NUMBER OF MEN

01:47.732 --> 01:49.275
COMING AND GOING,

01:49.359 --> 01:51.444
WHICH HE COULDN'T
SAY SPECIFICALLY

01:51.528 --> 01:52.862
HOW THE GIRLS
MADE THEIR LIVING,

01:52.946 --> 01:54.781
ALTHOUGH HE THOUGHT
THEY WERE OFFICE WORKERS.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.117
UH, TEMPORARY OFFICE WORKERS
IS WHAT THEY TOLD ME.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.080
ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE OTHER
TENANTS TOLD HIM THAT HE
DID SEE CARLY AND ISHANA

02:02.163 --> 02:04.249
WORKING OVER
AT THE TATTLER,
A STRIP CLUB.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.667
I SEE.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.502
MR. LIPMAN ALSO DIDN'T KNOW
THE NAMES OF ANY OF THE MEN

02:07.585 --> 02:09.546
THAT CAME AND WENT
OUT OF THE APARTMENT.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.464
OK, THEN,
THANKS A LOT.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.883
Lipman: UH, AS FAR
AS THE DOG GOES,

02:13.967 --> 02:15.301
WITH ALL MY UPSETS

02:15.385 --> 02:17.887
WITH WHAT I
DISCOVERED IN HERE,
I LEFT THE DOOR OPEN,

02:17.971 --> 02:18.972
THE DOG RAN OUT.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.306
THE ONLY WITNESS.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.558
WELL, YEAH, WELL, NOW,

02:21.641 --> 02:24.477
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
SAYING TO YOUR PARTNER.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.355
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT USE
THE DOG MIGHT BE TO YOU

02:27.438 --> 02:30.441
AS FAR AS SOME SORT OF
GROWLING IDENTIFICATION
IF YOU CAPTURE A SUSPECT,

02:30.525 --> 02:32.610
BUT ONCE HE
WAS IN THE HALL,

02:32.694 --> 02:35.113
SOME TENANT MUST HAVE LET
HIM OUT THE FRONT DOOR
OF THE BUILDING

02:35.196 --> 02:37.115
WHILE I WAS
OCCUPIED UP HERE,

02:37.198 --> 02:39.367
SOMEONE PISSED OFF
AT THE BARKING.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.827
OK, THEN.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.329
ANYTHING ELSE YOU
WANT TO ASK MR. LIPMAN
HERE, ANDY?

02:43.413 --> 02:45.456
NO, THAT COMPLETELY
COVERS IT.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.833
ANYWAYS, I STILL
GOT YOUR CARD.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.878
ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS,
YOU RING HIM UP.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.415
MEDAVOY, REMEMBER ME?

04:09.540 --> 04:10.541
SHEEDY?

04:10.625 --> 04:11.668
YEAH.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.961
HOW'S IT GOING?

04:13.211 --> 04:14.254
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN OUT?

04:14.337 --> 04:15.713
3 MONTHS. LISTEN,
I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.215
I GOT A SITUATION.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.633
YEAH? WHAT KIND
OF SITUATION?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.301
THE THING IS, I'M AFRAID
I COULD GET NAMED IN THIS,

04:20.385 --> 04:22.178
AND I CAN'T DO
NO MORE TIME. I'D GO NUTS.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.221
YEAH? ALL RIGHT, UH,

04:23.513 --> 04:26.474
COME ON OVER HERE.
TELL ME ABOUT THIS
SITUATION.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.894
THERE'S THIS GUY I
USED TO KNOW--ARCHIE.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.606
SO, UH, WHAT ABOUT
THIS ARCHIE?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.483
HE ASKED ME
TO DO SOMETHING.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.735
HE ASKED ME TO TRY
TO FIND SOMEBODY TO
DO A JOB FOR HIM,

04:37.986 --> 04:40.321
AND I SAID I'D
PUT OUT A FEELER,
THEN I GOT WORRIED.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.532
HE COULD GET CAUGHT,
AND MY NAME COULD GET
MIXED UP IN IT.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.700
WHAT'S HE WANT DONE?

04:43.825 --> 04:46.369
ARCHIE WANTS
SOME GUY WHACKED.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.999
WHO'S THE GUY?

04:51.082 --> 04:53.876
ARCHIE'S GIRLFRIEND'S
EX-HUSBAND-TO-BE,
FELLA NAMED CARMINE.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.421
THEY'RE SEPARATED,
AND ARCHIE'S HANGING
OUT WITH HER NOW.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.922
"EX-HUSBAND-TO-BE,"

04:58.006 --> 05:00.633
THAT WOULD MAKE CARMINE
THE CURRENT HUSBAND.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.176
TECHNICALLY, YEAH.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.846
ANYWAY, ARCHIE,
WHO IS HANGING OUT
WITH CARMINE'S WIFE,

05:04.929 --> 05:07.515
FEELS PROSPECTIVELY
THAT HE'S IN DANGER
FROM THIS GUY,

05:07.598 --> 05:11.144
AND HE WANTS DONE
WHAT HE THINKS EVENTUALLY
CARMINE'S GONNA DO TO HIM.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.062
WHICH IS CROAK HIM FOR
SLEEPING WITH HIS WIFE.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.189
IF ARCHIE'S YOUR FRIEND,
WHY YOU TELLING THIS?

05:15.273 --> 05:16.983
YOU ALREADY ASKED
SOMEBODY TO DO THE HIT?

05:17.066 --> 05:20.862
YEAH. YEAH, I ASKED
SOMEBODY IF THEY
WANTED THE CONTRACT,

05:21.112 --> 05:23.072
AND ARCHIE AND HIM
COULDN'T GET TOGETHER
ON A PRICE,

05:23.114 --> 05:24.532
AND THEN I GOT WORRIED.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.534
THIS GUY I TALKED TO MIGHT
COME FORWARD AND NAME ME.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.536
I SHOULD HAVE
STAYED OUT OF THIS.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.579
I'M GLAD YOU
FIGURED THAT OUT.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.581
ALL RIGHT, THE WAY
WE PROCEED, UH,

05:31.664 --> 05:35.710
WE'D SET UP A MEETING
WITH YOU BRINGING A NEW
HIT MAN TO MEET WITH ARCHIE,

05:35.793 --> 05:38.504
A GUY WHO'D BE WILLING
TO MAKE THE CONTRACT
AT A LOWER PRICE.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.882
AND THE HIT MAN
WOULD BE A COP?
YEAH.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.051
IN FACT,
UH, I COULD PLAY
THE HIT MAN MYSELF.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.219
MEDAVOY, I GOTTA
SPEAK UP HERE

05:45.303 --> 05:46.763
'CAUSE IT'S
MY ASS ON THE LINE.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.682
AND IT'S A WHOLE LOOK
AND STYLE, AND I LOOK
AT YOU AND...

05:49.766 --> 05:51.184
I DON'T SEE IT.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.727
WHAT, 'CAUSE
I GOT RED HAIR?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.562
IT'S NOT THE HAIR.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.813
THERE'S
RED-HAIRED HIT MEN.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.690
GREG, WE'RE GETTING
AHEAD OF OURSELVES HERE.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.275
WE GOT TO RUN IT
BY THE BOSS.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.487
YEAH, WE'LL TALK TO HIM.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.158
I NO MEAN TO DO IT.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.369
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO?
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO
TAKE IT?

06:09.452 --> 06:10.953
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.207
I GIVE IT.
I NO MEAN TO GIVE IT.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.167
WELL, WHO'D YOU
GIVE IT TO?

06:16.250 --> 06:19.587
HE COME TO PICK UP
FOOD FOR THE POOR PEOPLE.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.589
I GIVE TO HIM
CANS OF FOOD,

06:21.672 --> 06:24.300
BUT I NO MEAN
TO GIVE THE NECKLACE.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.178
HE CAME COLLECTING,
WHAT, FOOD DONATIONS,

06:27.261 --> 06:29.722
AND YOU GAVE HIM
A DIAMOND NECKLACE?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.724
I GIVE HIM CANS OF FOOD,

06:31.808 --> 06:36.729
AND MRS. COX SAY INSIDE
ONE OF THEM WAS THE NECKLACE.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.439
[SOBBING]

06:38.523 --> 06:41.818
SHE WAS HELPING ME
WITH MY PAPERS.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.987
NOW SHE WANT TO
SEND ME BACK TO GUATEMALA.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.365
[SIGHS]

06:49.158 --> 06:52.453
YOU HAD A CAN OF SOUP
WITH A $13,000 NECKLACE
INSIDE?

06:52.537 --> 06:55.790
IT WASN'T A CAN OF SOUP.
IT ONLY LOOKED LIKE ONE.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.960
MY VALUABLES ARE
HIDDEN IN FAKE BOOKS,

06:59.043 --> 07:00.753
A FAKE CAN
OF SHAVING CREAM,
AND WHATNOT.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.880
YOU CAN BUY THEM
AT A LOCKSMITH'S.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.882
YEAH, I KNOW
ALL ABOUT THEM,
AND SO DO THIEVES.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.551
THEY'LL GO RIGHT
TO THOSE CANS.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.929
ESTHER CLAIMS THAT SHE
GAVE IT AWAY TO CHARITY--
THE SEED OF HOPE--

07:10.012 --> 07:11.722
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.974
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THEM?

07:13.057 --> 07:15.685
YES, I BELIEVE I'VE
MADE DONATIONS TO THEM.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.521
MRS. COX, WHY
DON'T YOU WAIT HERE?

07:28.030 --> 07:30.116
JILL, CAN I
TALK TO YOU A SEC?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.704
YEAH?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.664
YOU THINK SHE REALLY
STOLE THIS NECKLACE?

07:36.747 --> 07:38.708
OH, I'M TENDING
TO BLAME THE WOMAN,

07:38.791 --> 07:40.710
LEAVING SOMETHING THAT
VALUABLE SITTING AROUND
IN A CAN.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.587
IS THAT THE SAME STORY
YOU HEARD?

07:42.670 --> 07:44.505
YEAH. SHE'S OUT TO
GET THIS HOUSEKEEPER.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.048
AND I DON'T THINK
SHE DESERVES IT.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.717
STAY WITH HER. I'LL SEE
IF I CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.010
OK.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.849
MRS. COX,
WE'RE NOT SURE

07:54.932 --> 07:56.809
THERE'S BEEN
ANY VIOLATION
OF THE LAW HERE.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.478
NO VIOLATION?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.480
I WANT THAT NECKLACE,

08:00.563 --> 08:02.690
AND I WANT HER SENT
BACK TO HER OWN COUNTRY.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.609
YOUR HOUSEKEEPER'S
SAYING IT'S AN ACCIDENT.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.068
WHAT IF THAT'S TRUE?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.988
AN ACCIDENT?
IF SHE DID GIVE IT AWAY,
SHE KNEW THE MAN.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.656
WE'LL CHECK
WITH SEED OF HOPE.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.700
IF WE GET
THE NECKLACE BACK,
WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED?

08:12.783 --> 08:15.495
THAT BE ENOUGH TO KEEP
THINGS CLEAR WITH ESTHER
AND THE I.N.S.?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.371
JUST GET
MY NECKLACE BACK.

08:17.455 --> 08:21.167
FINE. WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.550
YEAH, I THINK
IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.386
UM, PICK A PUBLIC PLACE,
LIKE A BAR.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.888
SO WHO'S GOING
TO BE THE HIT MAN?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.223
I THOUGHT ME.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.225
YEAH, WE COULD
HAVE IT BE YOU,

08:37.308 --> 08:39.894
OR WE COULD
LET JAMES DO IT.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.772
WELL, I--I THOUGHT
THE RIGHT CLOTHES,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE A HAT...

08:42.855 --> 08:44.440
UH, NO, NO,
LET ME TELL YOU.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.817
UM, LET JAMES
BE THE HIT MAN.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.070
SO, UH,
WHAT WOULD I BE,

08:49.153 --> 08:50.321
LIKE, UH,

08:50.404 --> 08:51.781
A BARFLY, OR...

08:51.864 --> 08:53.574
WE WANT EVERYTHING
TO LOOK NORMAL.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.035
WHAT, I'M NOT NORMAL?

08:56.118 --> 08:58.454
UH, GREG, YOU
MIGHT BE A LITTLE
TOO NORMAL.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.541
MIGHT NOT
BE PERSUASIVE
AS A BARFLY.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.000
TAKE RUSSELL
OR KIRKENDALL.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.545
YEAH, YEAH, LIKE
I'M HAVING A DRINK
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.965
OK, GOOD.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.432
DETECTIVE, A MR. HARPER
ASKING FOR YOU.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.185
COME ON IN,
MR. HARPER.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.230
I WAS TOLD TO SEE
A DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.898
I'M DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.692
COME ON, LET'S TALK
IN THIS ROOM HERE.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.569
WELL, WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.445
THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME
WHAT IT IS OVER THE PHONE.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.406
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT IN HERE, HMM?

09:33.489 --> 09:35.449
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.451
UH, NO,
I'M--I'M FINE.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.619
COFFEE? SODA?

09:38.703 --> 09:40.246
NOTHING.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.582
WELL, SOMETHING
HAPPENED, MR. HARPER.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.001
YOUR DAUGHTER AND
HER ROOMMATE'S APARTMENT
GOT BROKEN INTO.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.378
WE THINK IT WAS
SOMEBODY THAT KNEW THEM.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.381
UH, SHE EVER TALK
TO YOU ABOUT ANYBODY
BOTHERING THEM?

09:50.464 --> 09:52.842
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.803
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
HERE FOR A MINUTE.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.723
CAN YOU THINK OF
ANYBODY THAT THEY KNOW

09:58.806 --> 10:01.058
THAT MIGHT HAVE
SEEMED DANGEROUS?

10:01.142 --> 10:05.730
WELL,
CARLY HAD THIS BOYFRIEND
USED TO SMACK HER AROUND.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.566
ISHANA DIDN'T LIKE
BEING IN THE APARTMENT
WHEN HE WAS THERE.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.735
CARLY BROKE UP WITH HIM
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
I THINK.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.403
YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

10:12.486 --> 10:13.863
YEAH, ROLF.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.489
I MET HIM ONCE.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.949
ROLF LUBIN.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.451
HE'S A MECHANIC.

10:18.534 --> 10:19.869
YOU KNOW WHERE
WE CAN FIND HIM?

10:19.952 --> 10:20.953
NO.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.080
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO ISHANA?

10:25.499 --> 10:29.503
YOU GOT TO PREPARE
YOURSELF FOR WHAT
I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.757
YOUR DAUGHTER
AND CARLY WERE FOUND
DEAD THIS MORNING.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.676
SOMEBODY
STRANGLED THEM.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.054
NO! NO!

10:41.265 --> 10:42.516
OHH!

10:42.600 --> 10:44.518
WHO--

10:44.602 --> 10:46.270
WHO DID IT?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.772
WE DON'T KNOW.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.982
I'M SORRY.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.776
WAS SHE MAYBE...

10:51.859 --> 10:56.364
MIXED UP IN SOME THINGS
THAT, UH, ORDINARILY
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN?

10:56.447 --> 10:59.200
SHE WASN'T MIXED UP
IN NOTHING.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.202
NOW, I RAISED HER ALONE,

11:01.285 --> 11:03.704
BUT I RAISED HER RIGHT.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.332
SHE WAS DOING OFFICE WORK,

11:06.415 --> 11:09.210
GOING OUT FOR
SOME TEMP AGENCY.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.712
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
HAS HAPPENED TO ISHANA.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.965
SHE WAS DOING SO GOOD.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.553
WHY DID IT HAPPEN TO HER?

11:19.637 --> 11:22.473
DEAR GOD,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

11:26.143 --> 11:28.688
I WANT YOU TO GO HOME
AND GET SOME REST NOW.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.608
AS SOON AS WE
FIND SOMETHING OUT,
I'LL CALL YOU MYSELF.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.695

12:10.187 --> 12:11.731
WELL, THAT

12:11.814 --> 12:13.774
MAYBE IT IS SOME KIND
OF SCAM BETWEEN HIM
AND THE HOUSEKEEPER.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.444

16:13.430 --> 16:16.016
AND I WASN'T WITH CARLY

17:32.509 --> 17:33.927
I WAS GOING TO GO

17:34.011 --> 17:36.055
IF YOU WERE COLLECTING

17:36.138 --> 17:37.389
THAT'S A CRIME,
AND YOU CAN BE
PROSECUTED.

SHE'D SAVED
SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS

19:27.833 --> 19:29.543
TO HELP
GET HER CAREER GOING.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.711
SHE WAS GOING TO BE
A SINGER

19:30.794 --> 19:32.546
OR A MODEL.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.589
SHE HAD BIG PLANS.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.090

19:35.174 --> 19:36.842
WHERE WAS SHE
KEEPING THAT,
IN THE BANK?

19:36.925 --> 19:41.221
SHE HAD A SMALL SAFE
IN HER CLOSET.
I SAW IT.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.306
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A SAFE

19:42.389 --> 19:44.433
THAT WAS SMALL ENOUGH
TO PICK UP?

19:44.516 --> 19:47.853
YEAH. YEAH, I MEAN,
IF YOU MISSED IT,

19:47.936 --> 19:50.189
THE PEOPLE
THAT KILLED THEM
STOLE IT.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.191
DETECTIVE SIMONE,
TELEPHONE SECURITY.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.401
EXCUSE ME.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.028
YEAH, SIMONE.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.281
Simone: OH, YEAH.
GOOD, GOOD.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.283
LET ME HAVE
THE LAST NUMBER FIRST,
PLEASE.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.328
AFTER I FIRST SAW ISHANA,

20:04.411 --> 20:07.206
I HAD TO GO UP
AND TALK TO HER.

20:07.289 --> 20:11.043
HER BODY WAS
JUST SENSATIONAL.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.670
I'D NEVER SEEN
SUCH PERFECT BREASTS.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.715
AND I GOT A FEELING
YOU LOOKED AT
A LARGE NUMBER.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.008
OH, YEAH, THOUSANDS.

20:18.091 --> 20:21.220
CARLY, HER ROOMMATE--
WELL, THE OTHER VICTIM,

20:21.303 --> 20:26.642
SHE HAS LOVELY--
WHAT I WOULD CALL--
COCKER SPANIEL BREASTS.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.312
BUT ISHANA'S WERE
ABSOLUTELY SPHERICAL.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.023
I MEAN, HAD TO BE
RIGHT UP THERE AT THE TOP.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.274
ANDY.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.525
EXCUSE ME.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.613
I GOT THE PHONE DUMP.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.114
THE LAST CALL
OUT OF THE GIRLS'
APARTMENT

20:41.198 --> 20:42.824
WAS AT 2:13
THIS MORNING.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.451
THAT WAS CLOSE
TO THE TIME
OF THE MURDERS.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.953
IT'S A LOCAL NUMBER.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.287
Sipowicz:
LET'S GO TO THAT PLACE.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.247
WHAT ABOUT THIS MUTT?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.291
LET'S CUT HIM LOOSE.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.293
ALL RIGHT,
WE APPRECIATE WHAT
YOU'VE TOLD US, MR. HOGAN.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.628
YOU CAN GO.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.672
BUT, UH,
DON'T TAKE ANY TRIPS
OR NOTHING.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.423
I WASN'T INTENDING
ANY TRIPS.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.925
THEN DON'T ADJUST
YOUR PLANS.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.551
NO. FINE.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.940
I SWEAR HE ASKED ME
TO FIND A HIT MAN,
DETECTIVE.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.316
I DIDN'T MAKE
THIS STUFF UP.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.277
ARCHIE WANTS
TO SNUFF CARMINE.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.654
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT YOUR PAL ARCHIE'S
FULL OF CRAP?

21:20.737 --> 21:22.447
MAYBE IT MAKES HIM FEEL
LIKE A BIG MAN

21:22.531 --> 21:23.657
SAYING HE WANTS A HIT MAN,

21:23.740 --> 21:25.200
AND WHEN HE GETS ONE,
HE RUNS FOR COVER.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.201
NO GOOD?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.828
NO,
ARCHIE NEVER SHOWED.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.496
MAYBE ARCHIE DIDN'T
REALLY WANT A HIT MAN.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.541
MAYBE OUR FRIEND
MR. SHEEDY HERE
HAS IT IN FOR ARCHIE.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.501
MAYBE IT'S YOUR WIFE
ARCHIE'S PUTTING IT TO,

21:34.584 --> 21:35.627
SO YOU WANT TO JAM HIM UP.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.670
I DON'T HAVE A WIFE.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.171
ARCHIE ASKED ME
TO FIND SOMEONE

21:38.255 --> 21:39.172
TO RUB OUT
THE PRESENT HUSBAND

21:39.256 --> 21:40.549
OF THE WOMAN
HE'S INVOLVED WITH.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.968
YOU CAN
BELIEVE THAT OR NOT.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.886
I'M LEAVING,
AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING
MORE HELP FROM ME.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.847
Martinez:
OH, PERISH THAT THOUGHT.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.307
WARN THE GUY
ARCHIE'S PUTTING
THE HORNS ON

21:48.390 --> 21:50.183
HE MAY BE THE OBJECT
OF A CONTRACT

21:50.267 --> 21:51.351
AND LEAVE IT AT THAT.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.686
AND STOP CONFUSING US
WITH SOCIAL SERVICES.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.521
AH, BEAUTIFUL. GREAT.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.523
YOU DON'T NEED
TO HIT ME WITH A BUS.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.332
PRIMARILY SOUP.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.333
OK.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.584
I REMEMBER.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.668
HE DIDN'T WANT
ANY ARTICHOKES
OR ASPARAGUS.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.879
NO SARDINES OR YAMS.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.505
NOW, YAMS I THOUGHT
HE WOULD HAVE BOUGHT--

22:20.589 --> 22:22.215
OK. OK.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.926
YOU RUN THIS STORE?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.345
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.263
DID YOU BUY CANNED GOODS
FROM THIS GUY YESTERDAY?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.389
I DON'T RECOGNIZE HIM.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.724
YEAH, YOU DO.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.059
I BROUGHT IN 3 BAGS
OF CANNED STUFF
YESTERDAY.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.310
GO AHEAD. TELL HER.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.227
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS STOLEN.
WERE THEY STOLEN?

22:34.311 --> 22:35.228
JUST SHOW ME THE CANS,

22:35.312 --> 22:36.813
AND YOU WON'T BE
IN ANY TROUBLE.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.985
Driscoll:
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.369
DETECTIVE.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.456
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.208
NOTHING.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.752
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

22:58.835 --> 22:59.753
SO I'M OFF THE HOOK NOW,
RIGHT?

22:59.836 --> 23:01.338
YEAH, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.255
THOSE ARE FAKE,
RIGHT?

23:02.339 --> 23:03.340
YEAH.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.926
OTHERWISE,
I GOT TO KILL MYSELF.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.310
LIEU.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.270
HEY.
WHAT DID YOU GET?

23:17.354 --> 23:19.940
TALKED TO THE LAST PERSON
THAT WAS ON THE GIRL'S
PHONE RECORD.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.983
GOT A TAPE PLAYER?

23:22.067 --> 23:22.984
YEAH.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.403
GUY'S NAME IS
TERRY REYNOLDS.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.114
REYNOLDS' WIFE,
SHE TURNS THE PHONE
RINGER OFF

23:27.197 --> 23:28.240
WHEN THEY GO TO BED.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.117
WHEN THEY WOKE UP
THIS MORNING,

23:30.200 --> 23:31.701
THERE WAS THIS MESSAGE
ON THEIR MACHINE
FROM ONE OF HIS BUDDIES.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.580
IT'S STILL
ON THE TAPE HERE.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.625
THIS GUY, HE SOUNDS
SHOOK DOWN TO HIS SHOES.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.794
Voice on tape:
TERRY. TERRY, YOU THERE?

23:40.877 --> 23:42.087
HEY, TERRY, PICK UP, MAN.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.130
IF YOU'RE THERE, PICK UP.
IT'S TONY.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.632
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU, MAN.

23:45.715 --> 23:46.758
I'M JAMMED UP
WITH SOMETHING HERE.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.510
SOMETHING BAD.
THIS IS REAL BAD, TERRY.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.095
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.179
I NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEBODY, OK?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.431
I GOT TO FIGURE
SOME WAY OUT OF THIS.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.641
COME ON, MAN.
ANSWER THE PHONE, MAN.

23:54.724 --> 23:55.684
ANSWER THE PHONE.
I KNOW YOU'RE HOME.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.019
DON'T LEAVE ME
HANGING HERE. [BEEP]

23:58.103 --> 24:00.313
WHO IS THIS GUY?

24:00.397 --> 24:01.857
NAME'S TONY SLATER.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.568
HE WASN'T HOME
WHEN WE STOPPED BY
THE DUMP HE'S LIVING IN.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.777
WHAT'S B.C.I.
GOT ON HIM?

24:05.861 --> 24:07.154
A COUPLE OF BUSTS
FOR THEFT.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.738
HIS BUDDY
THAT GOT THE PHONE MESSAGE

24:08.822 --> 24:12.367
SAID HE WORKS FOR A LIVING.
STOCKROOM OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.578
BIG STEP UP--
THEFT TO DOUBLE HOMICIDE.

24:14.661 --> 24:15.787
YEAH. I THINK
WE'RE GOING TO FIND

24:15.871 --> 24:17.873
ANOTHER GUY OR TWO
CHEERING HIM ON.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.249
HE'S LIABLE TO SKIP.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.333
YEAH, WE'RE GOING
BACK THERE NOW,

24:20.417 --> 24:22.502
SIT ON HIS PLACE,
AND GRAB HIM UP.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.867
HEY, JAMES,
LOOK AT THAT.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.497
LOOKS LIKE ARCHIE'S
REALLY MOVED IN
ON CARMINE'S WIFE.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.166
Woman: YES?

25:01.249 --> 25:02.209
YVETTE WINKLER?

25:02.292 --> 25:03.502
YEAH. WHY?

25:03.585 --> 25:05.253
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR ARCHIE BELLOWS.
HE HERE?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.131
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHO ARE YOU?

25:08.215 --> 25:11.843
TAKE IT EASY.
DETECTIVE MARTINEZ,
DETECTIVE MEDAVOY.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.261
COPS, THANK GOD.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.013
YOU FINALLY FIGURED OUT
ARCHIE'S IN REAL DANGER.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.681
SO ARCHIE'S
LIVING HERE WITH YOU?

25:16.765 --> 25:18.808
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
WE'VE HAD.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.894
IT'S ABOUT TIME
THE AUTHORITIES
FINALLY STEPPED IN.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.145
WHERE IS HE NOW, YVETTE?

25:22.229 --> 25:23.146
HE'LL BE BACK
ANY MINUTE.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.147
HE'LL BE SO RELIEVED

25:24.231 --> 25:26.024
FINALLY GETTING
SOME PROTECTION.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.484
YVETTE,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:27.567 --> 25:28.693
IT'S OK.
THEY'RE COPS.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.286
LISTEN, LISTEN.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.288
I'M A MARKED MAN.
DID SHE TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.748
OF COURSE
I TOLD THEM.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.376
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS
DOWN AT OUR STATION HOUSE?

25:44.459 --> 25:45.502
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.711
COULD SOMEONE
GO CHECK FOR SNIPERS?

25:46.795 --> 25:47.963
I THINK THERE'S A SNIPER
UP THERE. PLEASE.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.339
WHY DON'T YOU COME
WITH US?

25:49.422 --> 25:50.674
WE'LL GUARANTEE
A SAFE TRIP.

25:50.757 --> 25:51.800
Yvette:
HOW ABOUT A GUARANTEE
FOR MY SAFETY?

25:51.883 --> 25:53.051
NO. I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.302
I'M NOT LEAVING
YVETTE HERE
UNPROTECTED, OK?

25:54.386 --> 25:55.512
Martinez:
YVETTE CAN GO WITH US.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.556
I'M PUTTING ON
MY SUNGLASSES
AND MY SCARF.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.267
RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO GET
MY GLASSES, TOO, OK?

26:00.350 --> 26:01.393
GO GET YOUR GLASSES.
THEN WE'LL GO.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.273
GUY'S PARANOID,
HE PUTS HIS NAME
ON A MAILBOX.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.733
CAN YOU BELIEVE
HE'D HAVE A GUY WHACKED
OVER THAT?

26:08.817 --> 26:10.569
I GUESS EVERYONE'S
GOT THEIR MATCH OUT THERE.

26:19.494 --> 26:23.331
LOOK, ALL I WANT
IS PROTECT MYSELF FROM
A WOULD-BE ASSASSIN.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.167
WELL, IT BEING
THE WOULD-BE ASSASSIN'S HOUSE
YOU'RE SHACKED UP IN

26:26.251 --> 26:27.627
WITH THE WOULD-BE
ASSASSIN'S WIFE,

26:27.711 --> 26:30.005
I WOULDN'T BE COUNTING
ON THE SYMPATHY VOTE
FROM A JURY,

26:30.088 --> 26:32.632
YOU TAKING OUT A CONTRACT
ON THE WOULD-BE
ASSASSIN'S LIFE.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.884
HE HIRED SOMEBODY FIRST.
HE HAS A HIT OUT ON ME.

26:34.968 --> 26:35.969
SIT DOWN.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.721
I NEED SOMEBODY
FOR SELF-DEFENSE.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.639
HOW DO WE KNOW
HE TOOK OUT
A CONTRACT ON YOU?

26:39.723 --> 26:40.890
I HEARD IT
ON THE STREET.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.852
A GUY WARNED ME.
I'M DEAD MEAT.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.562
LISTEN CAREFULLY, ARCHIE.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.564
THE WHOLE REASON
WE WENT TO THAT RESIDENCE

26:47.647 --> 26:49.024
WE PICKED YOU UP AT

26:49.107 --> 26:51.192
WAS THINKING
YVETTE'S HUSBAND CARMINE
STILL RESIDED THERE.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.028
NO, NO, NO. HE'S OUT.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.362
WHAT WE WERE
GOING TO TELL CARMINE

26:54.446 --> 26:57.449
LOOK OVER BOTH HIS SHOULDERS
IN CASE HALF A NUT JOB,

26:57.532 --> 26:58.783
LIKE YOURSELF,

26:58.867 --> 27:01.870
ENGAGES SOMEONE
ON A PREEMPTIVE HOMICIDE
MISSION.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.039
NOW, BEING AS WE'LL BE
TALKING WITH HIM ANYWAY,

27:04.122 --> 27:06.082
WE'LL ALSO REMIND HIM
NOT TO KILL YOU.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.959
CARMINE
IS DANGEROUS SCUM.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.462
HE'S GOING TO DENY IT,

27:10.545 --> 27:11.755
AND IT'S ALL
GOING TO FALL ON ME

27:11.838 --> 27:12.797
JUST 'CAUSE I WANT
TO SURVIVE.

27:12.881 --> 27:13.923
SPEAKING CANDIDLY,
ARCHIE,

27:14.007 --> 27:15.675
AT THIS POINT,
WE WASH OUR HANDS.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.469
WE'RE INVOLVED
WORKING NUMEROUS CRIMES

27:17.552 --> 27:19.804
THAT HAVE ALREADY
ACTUALLY OCCURRED.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.223
WHERE IS MY FIANCéE?

27:23.308 --> 27:26.436
I'M TOLD YVETTE WAS HERE
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES

27:26.519 --> 27:28.855
THEN FELT UNSAFE AND FLED.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.191
SHE HAS AN ACUTE SENSE
OF DANGER.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.985
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.238
WHAT THE HELL
YOU BUYING HIM
A SODA FOR?

27:37.322 --> 27:38.490
MAN WANTED A SODA.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.293
WHAT DID YOU DO
LAST NIGHT, TONY?

27:50.377 --> 27:51.711
I WAS HOME
WATCHING TV.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.174
CAN I GET
THAT SODA NOW?

27:58.468 --> 28:01.012
HOME WATCHING TV.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.768
HEY, CONCENTRATE
ON BEING TRUTHFUL
WITH YOUR ANSWERS,

28:06.851 --> 28:08.186
ALL RIGHT, TONY?

28:08.269 --> 28:09.396
'CAUSE WE GOT
OTHER PEOPLE GIVING US
INFORMATION.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.106
I TOLD THE TRUTH.
I WAS HOME.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.273
GIVE ME THAT DAMN SODA!

28:12.357 --> 28:13.358
WHAT ARE YOU GIVING SODAS

28:13.441 --> 28:15.026
TO LYING
SONS OF BITCHES FOR?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.152
I'M NOT LYING.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.612
YOU'RE JUST DIGGING
A HOLE DEEPER

28:17.696 --> 28:18.655
WHERE WE'RE GOING
TO BURY YOU.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.281
YOU ALREADY TOLD US
WHERE YOU WERE,

28:20.365 --> 28:23.451
AND IT WASN'T HOME
WATCHING NO MIDNIGHT
MOVIES.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.496
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT I TELL YOU?
I DIDN'T TELL YOU NOTHING.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.581
Tony on tape: TERRY!
TERRY, YOU THERE?

28:28.665 --> 28:29.874
HEY, TERRY, PICK UP, MAN.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.710
IF YOU THERE, PICK UP.
IT'S TONY.

28:31.793 --> 28:32.961
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, MAN.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.130
I'M JAMMED UP IN SOMETHING
HERE. SOMETHING BAD.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.631
THIS IS REAL BAD, TERRY.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.800
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,
AND I NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEBODY.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.427
I GOT TO FIGURE SOME WAY
OUT OF THIS.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.970
COME ON, MAN.
ANSWER THE PHONE.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.847
ANSWER THE PHONE.
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE HOME.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.933
DON'T LEAVE ME
HANGING HERE. [BEEP]

28:47.016 --> 28:48.143
TH-THAT'S NOT ME.

28:48.226 --> 28:51.813
THAT'S WHO YOU'RE GIVING
THESE DAMN SODAS TO.

28:51.896 --> 28:55.066
YOUR BUDDY TERRY
IDENTIFIED THAT
AS YOUR VOICE, TONY.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.484
AND WE GOT
THE RECORDS SHOWING

28:56.568 --> 28:58.069
A CALL FROM
ISHANA AND CARLY'S
APARTMENT

28:58.153 --> 29:01.322
TO TERRY REYNOLD'S
NUMBER AT 2:13
THIS MORNING,

29:01.406 --> 29:03.116
WHEN THOSE 2 GIRLS DIED.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.493
SO NOW WE GOT YOU
IN THE APARTMENT

29:05.577 --> 29:07.120
AT THE TIME
OF THE MURDER.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.830
THEN WE GET
THE GOOD STUFF
FROM OUR LAB--

29:08.913 --> 29:11.249
YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ALL OVER EVERYTHING.

29:11.332 --> 29:14.002
YOUR DNA IN THE JUICES
YOU LEFT IN THOSE GIRLS.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.420
TOO BUSY RAPING
AND MURDERING, TONY,

29:15.503 --> 29:16.838
YOU DON'T
THINK ABOUT
ALL THE SCIENCE

29:16.921 --> 29:18.089
WE GOT NOWADAYS.

29:18.173 --> 29:22.385
OK, OK, OK,
I WAS OVER THERE
LAST NIGHT.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.679
SO, SURE,
I LEFT PRINTS
AND EVERYTHING, OK?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.389
AND THAT ABOUT THE FLUIDS.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.933
OK, I HAD SEX ON ISHANA,

29:29.017 --> 29:31.102
BUT I DIDN'T RAPE HER,
AND I LEFT.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.188
THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN ALL THAT
FROM THE SCIENCE ANGLE.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.190
TALKING TO THIS GUY
LIKE A THINKING
HUMAN BEING.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.109
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE
HANGING UPSIDE DOWN
SPITTING CHICLETS.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.528
"TERRY, I'M JAMMED UP
IN SOMETHING BAD."

29:40.612 --> 29:43.198
WHAT'S THE ANGLE
ON THAT, TONY?

29:43.281 --> 29:45.992
I CAN--I CAN EXPLAIN.
SEE, I WASN'T ALONE
WITH THEM.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.368
NO. THERE WAS
ANOTHER GUY,

29:47.452 --> 29:48.912
AND HE WAS TRYING
TO RUN A CON ON THEM,

29:48.995 --> 29:50.205
TELLING THEM
A BUNCH OF LIES

29:50.288 --> 29:51.748
ABOUT HOW HE WAS GOING
TO PUT THEM IN A RAP VIDEO.

29:51.831 --> 29:54.876
SEE, ALL THE LIES,
IT WAS MAKING ME FEEL BAD.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.003
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS REFERRING TO
ON THE PHONE.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.130
SEE, 'CAUSE I REALLY KNOW
A RAP SINGER,

29:59.214 --> 30:01.800
AND I WAS TRYING TO HELP
ISHANA AND CARLY
GET IN HIS VIDEO.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.676
I TOLD THEM I'D
BRING THEM OVER
TO MEET HIM,

30:03.760 --> 30:05.720
BUT IT TURNED OUT
THERE WASN'T ANY MONEY
FOR THE VIDEO,

30:05.804 --> 30:06.930
SO HE WOULDN'T COME.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.723
SO I BROUGHT
THIS FRIEND OF MINE ALONG,

30:08.807 --> 30:10.517
AND WE SAID HE WAS
THE SINGER'S MANAGER--

30:10.600 --> 30:12.602
I'M GONNA
POP YOUR EYEBALLS OUT
WITH MY THUMBS!

30:12.685 --> 30:14.103
I'M FOLLOWING HIM, ANDY.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.732
SO AT THIS POINT,
YOU'RE THINKING
TO YOURSELF STILL,

30:17.816 --> 30:20.610
"I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET LAID SOMEWHERE
OUT OF THIS."

30:20.693 --> 30:23.196
THAT'S WHAT WAS
ON MY MIND,

30:23.279 --> 30:25.490
BUT--BUT WRIGHT KEPT
MAKING ME NERVOUS...

30:25.573 --> 30:26.658
THE WAY HE WAS COMING ON.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.243
SEE, HE WAS PUSHING
TOO HARD.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.036
WHAT'S THE REST
OF WRIGHT'S NAME?

30:30.119 --> 30:31.120
JAMISON.

30:31.204 --> 30:32.747
WRIGHT LEAVE
WHEN YOU LEFT?

30:32.831 --> 30:33.748
NO, HE STAYED.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.083
NO, NO, NO.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.626
BOTH OF YOU LEFT
AT THE SAME TIME,

30:36.709 --> 30:39.462
AND YOU WERE CARRYING
ISHANA'S SAFE WITH YOU.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.256
WHAT'S THIS TALK ABOUT
A SAFE? WHO'S GIVING YOU
THIS STUFF?

30:41.339 --> 30:42.465
WHO DO YOU <i>THINK?</i>

30:42.549 --> 30:44.008
IF IT'S WRIGHT,
HE'S A STONE LIAR, MAN,

30:44.092 --> 30:45.552
I'LL TELL YOU THAT
STRAIGHT UP!

30:45.635 --> 30:47.804
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T PEDDLE
NO COCKAMAMIE STORY

30:47.887 --> 30:49.681
HOW HE HAD SEX
AND THEN SPLIT

30:49.764 --> 30:50.932
AND THEN SOME
MYSTERY MURDERER

30:51.015 --> 30:52.809
CAME SLIDING DOWN
THE CHIMNEY.

30:52.892 --> 30:55.311
WE'LL BELIEVE
THE STORY, TONY,
IF IT FITS THE EVIDENCE.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.647
AND RIGHT NOW, YOUR STORY
DON'T FIT DICK.

30:57.730 --> 30:58.982
Simone: SEE, TONY,
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE AS BAD

30:59.065 --> 31:00.441
AS THIS WHOLE THING
MAKES YOU LOOK,

31:00.525 --> 31:01.901
BECAUSE YOU DID MAKE
THE PHONE CALL.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.152
HE DON'T ADMIT
THAT WAS HIM.

31:03.236 --> 31:07.073
THAT CALL SHOWS CONCERN
AND REMORSE...

31:07.156 --> 31:08.366
WHICH IS HOW
REHABILITATION STARTS.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.243
YOU'RE GIVING THIS GUY
A LOT OF CREDIT.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.495
JUST KEEP ON GOING
DOWN THAT ROAD, TONY,

31:12.579 --> 31:14.205
THEN THE D.A.
WON'T BE SEEING

31:14.289 --> 31:17.500
NO COLD-BLOODED,
MURDERING SEX FIEND
NO MORE.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.127
WHAT HE'S
LOOKING AT NOW...

31:19.210 --> 31:21.588
A RECLAMATION PROJECT.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.593
I--I GOTTA THINK
IF THAT'S HOW I WANT
TO GO 'CAUSE...

31:26.676 --> 31:29.178
I--I DIDN'T GET NO SLEEP,
AND--AND--AND, YOU KNOW,

31:29.262 --> 31:30.471
THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

31:31.639 --> 31:32.599
SURE.

31:32.682 --> 31:33.933
TAKE SOME TIME.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.229
COME ON.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.565
TONY...

31:42.066 --> 31:43.610
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.204
THERE YOU GO.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.833
CARMINE,
WE GOT TO ASK YOU
SOME PERSONAL QUESTIONS

31:58.917 --> 32:01.544
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE
COMMISSION OF A CRIME.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.338
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW?

32:03.421 --> 32:05.506
YOUR WIFE'S LIVING
WITH ANOTHER MAN,
RIGHT?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.550
WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT
OF YOURS?

32:07.634 --> 32:09.552
WE'RE ESTABLISHING
THE SITUATION, SIR.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.429
WELL, YOU KNOW SHE IS,
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.

32:11.512 --> 32:14.682
SHE'S LIVING WITH
A SON OF A BITCH
NAMED ARCHIE BELLOWS, OK?

32:14.766 --> 32:17.226
BANGING HIM EVERY NIGHT
IN MY BED.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.729
PROBABLY ALL DAY
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.064
IN <i>MY HOUSE</i>
THAT <i>I PAID FOR.</i>

32:21.147 --> 32:23.024
OK? IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

32:23.107 --> 32:24.442
UNDERSTANDABLY,
YOU'RE UPSET.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.945
THIS IS A DETECTIVE?

32:28.237 --> 32:29.697
WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO EMBARRASS YOU.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.532
HIS POINT IS
WE RECEIVED INFORMATION

32:31.616 --> 32:34.035
THAT YOU HIRED SOMEONE
TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS SITUATION.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.662
I HIRED SOMEBODY?
TO DO WHAT?

32:35.745 --> 32:37.038
ELIMINATE YOUR PROBLEM.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.165
HOW AM I GOING
TO ELIMINATE MY PROBLEM

32:39.248 --> 32:40.667
IF MY WIFE'S GOT HOT PANTS

32:40.750 --> 32:43.211
FOR A WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAP
LIKE ARCHIE BELLOWS?

32:43.294 --> 32:44.879
THE STORY WE GOT,
CARMINE,

32:44.963 --> 32:47.215
IS THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM
WITH A HIT MAN.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.800
A HIT MAN?

32:48.883 --> 32:51.260
THAT'S THE INFORMATION
WE GOT.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.637
[LAUGHING]

32:52.720 --> 32:54.222
WHO GAVE IT TO YOU?

32:55.348 --> 32:56.432
WE CAN'T DIVULGE THAT.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.559
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT
FROM A HIT MAN,

32:58.643 --> 33:00.937
'CAUSE I DIDN'T <i>HIRE</i>
NO HIT MAN.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.190
YOU HEARD IT FROM SOMEBODY
DOESN'T KNOW HIS ASS
FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND.

33:04.273 --> 33:06.067
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT A HIT MAN?

33:06.150 --> 33:08.569
THAT'S THE STUPIDEST THING
I EVER HEARD OF.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.488
WHERE DO YOU GET
INFORMATION LIKE THAT?

33:10.571 --> 33:12.240
SOMEONE TIPPED ARCHIE.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.742
ARCHIE MADE IT UP HIMSELF.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.785
WHY?

33:15.868 --> 33:17.787
'CAUSE HE'S A JERK-OFF,

33:17.870 --> 33:19.664
AND MY NAME'S CARMINE.

33:19.747 --> 33:22.625
I GOT AN ITALIAN MOTHER
NAMED ME CARMINE.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.210
SO THIS JERK'S
WETTING HIS PANTS

33:24.293 --> 33:26.295
THINKING I TOOK
A CONTRACT OUT ON HIM.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.673
WELL, I OUGHT TO DO IT,
BUT I DIDN'T.

33:28.756 --> 33:29.716
YOU DIDN'T.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.092
YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T?

33:31.175 --> 33:34.512
'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE
THE GUTS.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.055
I'M A WIMP.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.598
I'M NOTHING BUT A WIMP.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.020
WAIT HERE A MINUTE,
CARMINE.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.114
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

33:53.197 --> 33:54.449
I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.117
I WENT IN THERE THINKING
HE TOOK OUT THE CONTRACT.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.201
NOW IT DON'T SEEM LIKE THAT.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.162
SO WHERE DOES THAT
LEAVE ARCHIE?

33:59.245 --> 34:01.080
DEPENDS IF WE WANT
TO ASK THE D.A.
TO COLLAR ARCHIE

34:01.164 --> 34:04.167
FOR SOLICITING
YOUR PAL SHEEDY
TO KILL CARMINE.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.627
YEAH. YOU FEEL LIKE
DOING THAT?

34:06.711 --> 34:08.129
AH. I THINK THEY'RE
IN A POSITION NOW

34:08.212 --> 34:11.007
LIKE THE NUCLEAR POWERS
DURING THE COLD WAR PERIOD.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.634
THEY GOT MUTUAL
DETERRENCE WORKING.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.470
LET'S CUT 'EM
ALL LOOSE.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.680
AND, UH, YOU TELL
YOUR BUDDY SHEEDY,

34:17.764 --> 34:18.973
NEXT TIME
HE'S LOOKING TO EARN,

34:19.057 --> 34:20.850
SIGN UP AT MANPOWER.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.531
IT'S US, TONY--

34:35.615 --> 34:38.201
ME AND YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.788
YOU DO SOME THINKING,
TONY?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.790
YEAH.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.291
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34:45.374 --> 34:46.751
I THINK I'M SCREWED.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.170
BUT I SWEAR,

34:49.253 --> 34:50.546
I DIDN'T RAPE
OR KILL EITHER ONE
OF THEM GIRLS, MAN,

34:50.630 --> 34:53.341
BUT THAT'S HOW IT'S
GOING TO LOOK.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.343
WELL, YOU GOT THE FLOOR.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.013
YOU TELL US HOW
IT REALLY WENT DOWN.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.850
I JUST WANTED
TO GET LAID.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.477
WE TOOK 'EM TO DINNER,

35:04.560 --> 35:07.063
BUT I THINK WRIGHT
BLEW OUR CHANCES,

35:07.146 --> 35:09.857
TRYING TO PLAY IT
LIKE HE WAS THIS
BIG TALENT MANAGER.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.150
THEY MUST HAVE SEEN
THROUGH HIM,

35:11.234 --> 35:13.861
'CAUSE WE COULDN'T
GET NOWHERE.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.530
AND THEN WRIGHT
GOT THE IDEA

35:15.613 --> 35:17.573
THAT WE'D MAKE LIKE WE WAS
TOO DRUNK TO GET HOME

35:17.657 --> 35:19.242
SO THEY'D LET US SLEEP
ON THE FLOOR.

35:19.325 --> 35:22.370
SO AT THAT POINT,
YOU INTENDED HARM
TO NO ONE.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.955
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,
MAN,

35:24.038 --> 35:26.040
I JUST WANTED
TO GET OVER ON ISHANA
AND GET THE HELL OUT.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.376
YEAH, BUT WRIGHT HAD
DIFFERENT PLANS?

35:29.836 --> 35:31.963
WRIGHT'S NOT
A BAD GUY, MAN,

35:32.046 --> 35:34.340
BUT HE'D SEEN
THEIR SAFE,

35:34.423 --> 35:35.758
AND HE WANTED
TO STEAL IT.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.052
THEY GAVE US
SOME BLANKETS,

35:38.136 --> 35:39.512
THEN CARLY
WENT IN HER ROOM

35:39.595 --> 35:42.181
AND ISHANA WENT OUT
TO WALK THE DOG.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.725
THAT'S WHEN WRIGHT
CAME AND SAID

35:44.809 --> 35:47.019
HE WAS GOING
TO BALL CARLY...

35:47.103 --> 35:48.437
AND WENT
IN HER ROOM.

35:48.521 --> 35:52.567
THERE WAS SOME NOISE
AND YELLING...

35:52.650 --> 35:54.735
BUT THEN HE CAME OUT
AND SAID HE'D LAID HER,

35:54.819 --> 35:56.404
AND SHE WAS DEAD.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.030
I THOUGHT
HE WAS KIDDING,

35:58.114 --> 36:00.199
BUT HE TOOK ME IN
AND SHOWED HER
TO ME.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.659
HE'D RAPED HER,

36:01.742 --> 36:05.079
AND HE SAID HE HAD
TO KILL HER TO--TO
KEEP HER QUIET.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.583
THEN HE SAID
WE HAD TO KILL
ISHANA, TOO.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.585
BUT SHE WAS STILL OUT?

36:10.668 --> 36:11.586
YEAH...

36:11.669 --> 36:13.212
WITH THE DOG.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.550
OH. THEN WRIGHT
WENT TO THE TOILET,

36:17.633 --> 36:19.260
AND THAT'S WHEN
I CALLED TERRY,

36:19.343 --> 36:20.219
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.470
I DIDN'T WANT ISHANA
TO GET KILLED,

36:21.554 --> 36:23.055
BUT I WAS AFRAID
OF WRIGHT.

36:23.139 --> 36:26.434
HE'S CRAZY. HE SAID
IF I DIDN'T KILL ISHANA,
HE'D HAVE TO KILL ME

36:26.517 --> 36:29.979
'CAUSE IT'D ALL BE ON HIM,
AND HE COULDN'T TRUST ME.

36:30.062 --> 36:31.314
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HER.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.899
SHE CAME BACK,

36:32.982 --> 36:34.984
AND SHE KNEW
SOMETHING WAS WRONG,

36:35.067 --> 36:36.819
'CAUSE WE WEREN'T
ACTING RIGHT.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.030
SHE WENT IN CARLY'S ROOM,
AND SHE SAW HER,

36:39.113 --> 36:40.698
AND THEN SHE KNEW
SHE WAS GOING TO DIE, TOO.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.533
AND WRIGHT HAD A HOLD
OF HER,

36:42.617 --> 36:43.993
AND SHE WAS SAYING THAT
WE COULD DO ANYTHING

36:44.076 --> 36:47.705
IF WE JUST LET HER LIVE.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.499
SHE'D BALL BOTH OF US
AND NEVER TELL THE POLICE
WE WAS THERE.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.043
OK, TONY, OK.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.586
WHAT DID YOU DO?

36:53.669 --> 36:56.380
SO I--I--I SAID OK.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.008
AND THAT'S WHEN
SHE LAID ME.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.384
I DIDN'T RAPE HER.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.720
SHE--SHE LET ME.

37:04.388 --> 37:07.058
THEN WRIGHT SAID
WE GOT TO KILL HER ANYWAY.

37:07.141 --> 37:09.060
BUT I COULDN'T DO IT.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.353
SO HE DID IT.

37:10.436 --> 37:13.314
THE WHOLE THING
WAS MAKING ME SICK.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.316
I MEAN,
ISHANA WAS A NICE GIRL.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.526
BUT YOU GOTTA WATCH OUT
FOR WRIGHT.

37:17.610 --> 37:21.656
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, MAN.

37:21.739 --> 37:24.158
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.952
YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
CALLING THE COPS

37:26.035 --> 37:28.162
INSTEAD OF CALLING
YOUR BUDDY TERRY?

37:31.082 --> 37:32.500
NO.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.377
NO.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.531
[SOFTLY]
HE'S IN THERE.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.865
I SAW HIM GO IN.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.242
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.327
[VOICES]

38:12.248 --> 38:14.542
MR. JAMISON, PLUMBER.
PLUMBER OUT HERE.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.710
I GOT TO GET
TO YOUR SINK.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.211
Jamison: SINK'S OK.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.213
NO, NO. IT'S BACKED UP
NEXT DOOR.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.716
I GOT TO GET TO YOUR SINK
TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

38:21.799 --> 38:24.051
[DOOR OPENING]

38:24.135 --> 38:25.886
GET YOUR HANDS UP
IN THE AIR!

38:25.970 --> 38:27.513
GET 'EM UP! BACK OFF!
BACK--TURN AROUND!

38:27.596 --> 38:29.724
DON'T YOU MAKE
NO SUDDEN MOVES.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.810
SEEING THOSE 2 DEAD GIRLS
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
GOT ME KIND OF EDGY.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.603
WHAT GIRLS, MAN?
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:34.687 --> 38:36.230
SHUT UP!
Simone: ANDY.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.444
COULDN'T GET
THOSE GIRLS'
SAFE OPEN, HUH?

38:41.527 --> 38:44.071
I FOUND THAT SAFE
IN A DUMPSTER, MAN.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.489
Sipowicz:
IN A DUMPSTER, HUH?

38:45.573 --> 38:48.034
WHAT, AND YOU ONLY FOUND
ONE SAFE IN THERE?

38:48.117 --> 38:49.702
OW!

38:49.785 --> 38:51.162
NO!

38:56.250 --> 38:58.169
A LOT OF TIMES,
EXPLAIN THE SITUATION,

38:58.252 --> 39:01.047
AND THE FUNERAL HOME
ADMINISTRATORS
WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.131
YEAH, RIGHT.

39:02.214 --> 39:05.009
MAYBE THE DOG
WILL SHOW UP TOMORROW.

39:05.092 --> 39:08.179
ASK YOUR DAUGHTER'S SUPER
TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

39:08.262 --> 39:10.264
HERE'S YOUR NECKLACE,
MRS. COX.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.142
OHH, YES, THAT'S IT.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.561
OHH, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.104
WELL, I EXPECT
AT THIS POINT YOU REALIZE

39:17.188 --> 39:19.065
THAT'S NO WAY TO SAFEGUARD
YOUR VALUABLES--

39:19.148 --> 39:20.858
IN A CABINET FULL
OF CANNED GOODS.

39:20.941 --> 39:23.110
NO, I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.571
AND ALSO
THAT YOUR HOUSEKEEPER
WASN'T REALLY AT FAULT.

39:25.654 --> 39:28.282
I GUESS NOW
I COULD KEEP ESTHER ON.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.369
I'M JUST NOT SURE I'LL FEEL
I CAN TRUST HER.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.828
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO MAKE YOUR HOUSEKEEPER

39:32.912 --> 39:35.331
PAY FOR
YOUR OWN THOUGHTLESSNESS
AND POOR JUDGMENT?

39:35.414 --> 39:39.126
WELL, APPARENTLY YOU'RE
CONFUSING MY THINKING
OUT LOUD ABOUT ESTHER

39:39.210 --> 39:41.462
WITH A REQUEST
FOR YOUR OPINION
ON THE MATTER.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.381
IF ESTHER
HAD BEEN INVOLVED,

39:43.464 --> 39:45.424
THAT CAN WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ON A SHELF

39:45.508 --> 39:47.009
IN A CORNER BODEGA
WHERE ANYBODY
COULD WALK IN

39:47.093 --> 39:48.594
AND BUY IT
FOR 79 CENTS.

39:48.677 --> 39:51.347
I'D LIKE MY OTHER
SOUP CANS BACK.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.723
WHAT?

39:52.807 --> 39:54.975
DID YOU RECOVER
THE OTHER SOUP CANS
I DONATED?

39:55.059 --> 39:58.312
IF THEY WERE
INAPPROPRIATELY RESOLD,
I WANT THEM BACK.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.438
WE DIDN'T GET THEM.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.524
SIGN THIS RECEIPT
FOR YOUR NECKLACE.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.194
INCIDENTALLY, MRS. COX,

40:05.277 --> 40:07.238
HAVE YOU BEEN MEETING
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY
REQUIREMENTS

40:07.321 --> 40:08.697
ON ESTHER'S EMPLOYMENT?

40:08.781 --> 40:11.242
I DON'T SEE WHERE
THAT'S YOUR CONCERN.

40:11.325 --> 40:13.619
IT WON'T BE,
UNLESS I HEAR
ESTHER'S LOST HER JOB.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.454
THEN IT'S GOING TO
CONCERN ME LONG ENOUGH

40:15.538 --> 40:18.416
TO CONTACT THE IRS
AND MAKE YOUR LIFE
GOOD AND MISERABLE.

40:18.499 --> 40:19.834
WELL...

40:19.917 --> 40:21.544
I CAN TELL
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.254
YEAH?
WAS THAT A TOUGH ONE?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.348
HI.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.558
HI.

40:35.641 --> 40:36.851
DID YOU WANT TO SEE
THE DETECTIVES AGAIN?

40:36.934 --> 40:37.977
YEAH.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.688
MR. HOGAN,
WASN'T IT?

40:40.771 --> 40:43.190
YEAH. YOU REMEMBER
MY NAME, HUH?

40:43.274 --> 40:46.068
DETECTIVES
SIMONE AND SIPOWICZ,
MR. HOGAN'S HERE.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.445
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU,
HOGAN?

40:47.528 --> 40:49.280
THERE'S SOMETHING
I THOUGHT OF.

40:49.363 --> 40:51.031
WE'RE IN
PRETTY GOOD SHAPE
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.867
WELL, I THOUGHT
I SHOULD TELL YOU,

40:52.950 --> 40:55.035
CARLY BROKE OFF
WITH THIS BOYFRIEND.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.620
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT MEANS ANYTHING,

40:56.704 --> 41:00.207
BUT I HEARD
HE HAD A VIOLENT TEMPER--
USED TO BEAT HER UP.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.876
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
ROLF LUBIN,

41:01.959 --> 41:03.085
THE MAD MECHANIC.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.628
Y-YOU ALREADY KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

41:04.712 --> 41:06.213
WE GOT HIM LOCKED UP
DOWNSTAIRS.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.549
HE DO THE MURDERS?

41:08.632 --> 41:10.050
NO.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.052
HE JUST TRIED
TO BEAT OUR HEADS IN
WITH A SOCKET WRENCH.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.346
A COUPLE OF OTHER SCUMBAGS
RAPED AND KILLED THE GIRLS.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.639
OH, NO.

41:15.723 --> 41:19.018
I TRIED TO WARN ISHANA
WHO SHE ASSOCIATED WITH,

41:19.101 --> 41:21.562
BUT YOUNG WOMEN, THEY
DON'T WANT ANY ADVICE.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.022
I WISH I COULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING FOR HER.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.899
YOU STILL FEEL LIKE
DOING SOMETHING?

41:24.982 --> 41:29.028
THE FATHER'S HAVING
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES
WITH THE FUNERAL EXPENSES.

41:29.111 --> 41:30.070
YEAH. WELL...

41:30.154 --> 41:31.405
I MIGHT HELP.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.574
I-I'D BE WILLING
TO CONTRIBUTE.

41:33.657 --> 41:34.783
WELL, WE GOT
HIS PHONE NUMBER

41:34.867 --> 41:36.744
IF YOU, UH,
WANT TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT IT.

41:39.163 --> 41:42.791
IS IT INAPPROPRIATE
FOR ME TO ASK THAT
YOUNG LADY'S NAME?

41:42.875 --> 41:44.293
COMPLETELY.

41:44.376 --> 41:47.087
BEING HONEST
IS PART OF WHY
I CAME BACK IN.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.049
HERE'S ISHANA'S
FATHER'S PHONE NUMBER.

41:50.132 --> 41:53.761
I, UH, GUESS I COULD
JUST TELL HIM I WAS
HER FRIEND, HUH?

41:53.844 --> 41:55.596
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE, RIGHT?

41:55.679 --> 41:56.847
RIGHT.

42:02.311 --> 42:03.562
ONLY FRIENDS.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.778
YEAH. THE DIRTY PART
WAS ALL IN YOUR MIND.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.168
DID YOU LIKE IT?

42:26.252 --> 42:27.878
YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING BACK.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.551
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
ALL MY STEPS.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.139
MMM.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.392
DON'T ASK
TO BORROW MONEY.

42:41.475 --> 42:45.020
I THINK MAYBE
WE WERE RIGHT, BOBBY.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.524
ABOUT?

42:48.607 --> 42:51.360
WHEN WE THOUGHT
WE MADE A BABY.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.197
MM-HMM.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.575
WELL, DON'T JUMP
UP AND DOWN.

42:57.658 --> 43:00.411
WELL, I DON'T CARRY
A CALENDAR, BUT HOW LATE
COULD YOU BE?

43:00.494 --> 43:02.997
ONLY 4 DAYS,
BUT I KNOW HOW I WORK.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.958
I ALREADY
FEEL DIFFERENT.

43:07.835 --> 43:08.836
COME HERE.

43:11.171 --> 43:13.173
IF YOU'RE RIGHT...

43:13.257 --> 43:16.510
I COULDN'T BE
ANY HAPPIER.

43:19.888 --> 43:22.558
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY
WE SHOULDN'T BE OUT
BUYING BABY CARRIAGES.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.518
NO, WE SHOULD BE OUT THERE
GETTING A MARRIAGE LICENSE.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.937
THAT'S SOMETHING
TO CONSIDER.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.525
YOU, GINA, AND ABBY.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.987
THINK IT'S SOMETHING
IN THE STATION HOUSE
WATER?

43:35.070 --> 43:36.196
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

43:36.280 --> 43:38.699
BUT THAT'S NOT
HOW IT HAPPENS.
YEAH?

43:38.782 --> 43:41.035
WELL, THEN,

43:41.118 --> 43:43.203
SHOW ME
HOW IT'S DONE.
