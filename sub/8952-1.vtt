02:54.530 --> 02:57.090
I'd like another shot
at that prize money.

02:57.210 --> 03:01.442
- Okay for next Sunday?
- No, Jim. It ain't okay.

03:01.570 --> 03:04.403
- Now, look, Bice...
- No, you look.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.646
All of my drivers
are 18, 19.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.284
You're too old
for these kid snorts.

03:09.410 --> 03:11.321
You're liable
to get hurt in there.

03:11.450 --> 03:15.079
You used to be a big track driver.
Ain't you got no pride?

03:15.210 --> 03:18.566
I ran out of pride
when I ran out of cars.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.840
Jim, you gotta look
at yourself.

03:20.970 --> 03:23.928
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks,
you think you're on your way.

03:24.050 --> 03:26.769
But it didn't
work out, did it?

03:33.290 --> 03:36.202
- Much obliged.
- You need any money?

03:37.770 --> 03:39.567
Nope.

03:39.690 --> 03:42.329
Hey.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.805
What do you do
with this stuff?

03:44.930 --> 03:47.398
It's for a friend.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.646
Hey! How'd it go?

03:52.770 --> 03:54.567
Okay.

03:54.690 --> 03:57.284
- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.

03:57.410 --> 03:59.640
Aw, the poor thing.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.567
I'll find a good spot for it.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.681
- You got hurt again.
- So?

04:03.810 --> 04:06.278
One of these days you're
gonna get wiped out entirely.

04:07.530 --> 04:09.327
Why you gotta be a driver?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.964
Maybe that's not
your thing, racing.

04:12.090 --> 04:14.968
How about all those car agencies
down on Van Ness?

04:15.090 --> 04:17.843
I bet a top mechanic there
gets a lot of good bread laid on him.

04:17.970 --> 04:19.767
What is the matter
with everybody?

04:19.890 --> 04:21.687
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic, I'm a driver.

04:21.810 --> 04:24.244
I know just how you feel, Jim.

04:24.370 --> 04:27.282
Hey, I used to think I was
happy painting flower seeds.

04:27.410 --> 04:31.244
Then one day, inside me,
this little voice says,

04:31.370 --> 04:33.440
"Tennessee Steinmetz. "

04:33.570 --> 04:36.482
I said, "What?"
It said, "You ain't happy. "

04:36.610 --> 04:40.762
Tennessee, why is it the only thing
we have in this house is parrot food?

04:40.890 --> 04:44.326
- I mean, we don't have a parrot.
- Eat that. That's good.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.408
That's pressed kelp.
That aerates your liver.

04:47.530 --> 04:50.408
Then this voice inside
of me continued as follows:

04:50.530 --> 04:54.079
"This is nowhere.
Ya gotta make a new scene.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.485
Ya gotta change your bag. "

04:56.610 --> 04:58.680
That's when I split.
I went to Tibet,

04:58.810 --> 05:02.519
to a mountaintop,
with swamis and monks.

05:02.650 --> 05:06.165
I discovered my real self.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.167
It was wonderful.

05:08.290 --> 05:11.839
I don't have
to go to Tibet.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.926
I know who I am.

05:15.490 --> 05:17.242
I know what I want.

05:17.370 --> 05:20.806
There are dirt track races at a carnival
near Bakersfield this week.

05:20.930 --> 05:24.161
If I can get over there
I can pick up a couple of bucks.
Okay to use your wheels?

05:24.290 --> 05:27.760
Okay, but you're gonna have
a little trouble getting it started.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.684
Where's the beast?

05:32.810 --> 05:35.119
You didn't
cut up the Edsel.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.761
It came over me
all of a sudden.

05:41.890 --> 05:44.723
It was the only
decent thing to do.

05:44.850 --> 05:48.365
Believe me, Jim,
it'll be happier up there.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.807
Are you all right?
Are you dizzy?

06:37.930 --> 06:40.319
Oh, no. There's a slight
racking pain in my head here.

06:40.450 --> 06:44.887
Oh, well, I think you'd better sit down.
I'm really terribly sorry.

06:45.010 --> 06:47.126
Well, it's not your fault.
I didn't mean to startle you.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.287
Looks like you've been running
into all sorts of things lately.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.686
Yeah. Oh, this
is just a little...

06:56.890 --> 07:00.041
- Oh, lady.
- Oh, really, sir.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.638
Excuse me.

07:06.650 --> 07:09.722
Over 400 cubes.

07:09.850 --> 07:13.479
Dual quads, all synchro box,
zero to 60 under five.

07:13.610 --> 07:16.249
All right, Miss Bennett.
I'll see to this gentleman myself.

07:16.370 --> 07:19.009
May I be of service, sir?

07:19.130 --> 07:22.406
I see that you're a person
who appreciates fine things.

07:22.530 --> 07:25.328
You're no doubt aware that this
is the celebrated Thorndyke special.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.725
Allow me to say, sir,

07:27.850 --> 07:30.762
that I think this car
would suit you very well.

07:30.890 --> 07:32.687
Yes.
Yes, it would.

07:32.810 --> 07:36.519
- May I offer you a glass
of sherry and a biscuit?
- Go right ahead.

07:36.650 --> 07:41.485
I take it the question of price
does not greatly concern
a gentleman like yourself.

07:41.610 --> 07:43.441
Oh, I wouldn't haggle
if that's what you mean.

07:43.570 --> 07:45.845
What price range
did you have in mind?

07:45.970 --> 07:47.688
About $75.

07:47.810 --> 07:51.769
$75.

07:51.890 --> 07:54.165
I could go 80 in a pinch.
What do you have in the way of
cheap, honest transportation?

07:54.290 --> 07:56.850
Cheap, honest transportation!

08:01.170 --> 08:02.967
I will bid you good day, sir.

08:03.090 --> 08:05.046
Good day.

08:05.170 --> 08:07.365
Hey!

08:07.490 --> 08:09.526
Havershaw!

08:09.650 --> 08:13.245
Now, where did
this come from?

08:13.370 --> 08:17.045
- Mr Thorndyke, yes, sir?
- What is this thing
doing in my showroom?

08:17.170 --> 08:19.286
I believe Miss Bennett
may know something about this.

08:19.410 --> 08:23.369
Yes. You remember when Mrs van Luit
purchased her new Bentley?

08:23.490 --> 08:26.641
She also requested us to buy
a small used car for her upstairs maid.

08:26.770 --> 08:30.240
Then why isn't her upstairs maid
in her blasted vehicle?

08:30.370 --> 08:32.167
The car was returned
this morning, Mr Thorndyke.

08:32.289 --> 08:34.565
She was having some kind
of difficulty with it.

08:34.690 --> 08:36.486
- Get it out of here!
- Yes, sir.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.921
What's that for?

08:40.049 --> 08:44.202
- I beg your pardon?
- Why don't you let the little car alone?

08:44.330 --> 08:48.039
Are you presuming to tell me
what to do in my own establishment?

08:48.170 --> 08:50.400
Okay, I'm out of line.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.760
It just bugs me to see somebody
abusing a decent piece of machinery.

08:52.890 --> 08:56.246
How fascinating.
Well, now that we've had the
benefit of your point of view,

08:56.370 --> 08:58.520
shall we regard our relationship
as terminated?

08:58.650 --> 09:01.960
Havershaw!
Get this eyesore out of my showroom.

09:02.090 --> 09:03.887
And if ever I find it here again,

09:04.010 --> 09:06.649
someone is going to find himself
in a great deal of trouble!

09:06.770 --> 09:09.125
Yes, sir. Of course.
Boys, here we go.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.969
Here we go.

09:13.730 --> 09:17.928
- Sorry. None of my business, is it?
- Perfectly all right.

09:18.050 --> 09:21.929
- Goodbye.
- Oh. Goodbye.

09:58.810 --> 10:02.200
- Good morning.
- Good morning. What do you want?

10:02.330 --> 10:06.243
- Police.
- Right. What do you want?

10:06.370 --> 10:09.840
Forgive me for pointing,
but have you ever seen that car before?

10:09.970 --> 10:14.566
- No. No, I haven't.
- Hey, he's a cute little fella.

10:14.690 --> 10:16.362
Hey, wait a minute.

10:16.490 --> 10:21.166
Wait a minute. I think I saw
that car at an agency yesterday.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.850
Now, permit to inform
you of the following:

10:23.970 --> 10:29.203
First, say nothing that would
jeopardize your constitutional rights.

10:29.330 --> 10:31.844
Second, the minute
you get downtown,

10:31.970 --> 10:34.882
I would advise
you get a good lawyer.

10:36.170 --> 10:39.526
- Shall we go?
- Go? What for?

10:40.970 --> 10:43.200
On suspicion of grand theft.

10:43.330 --> 10:47.687
Now, wait a minute.
There's something cockeyed about this.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.607
How did that little
car get here?

10:49.730 --> 10:54.520
I share your curiosity.
Shall we go?

10:59.130 --> 11:01.360
I'll do it.
Okay, I'll do it.

11:01.490 --> 11:05.768
But I want to go on record. I have seen
some crummy stunts used to sell cars,

11:05.890 --> 11:07.960
but this beats everything.

11:08.090 --> 11:10.558
To plant this Bug
in the possession of an innocent man
and accuse me of stealing it!

11:10.690 --> 11:12.487
How dare you, sir!

11:12.610 --> 11:14.487
Are you suggesting I would
stoop to such tactics?

11:14.610 --> 11:16.646
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting!

11:16.770 --> 11:19.807
In the first place, it might
interest you to know that
under normal circumstances,

11:19.930 --> 11:22.160
I would never sell a car
to someone with whom I'm not,

11:22.290 --> 11:24.804
shall we say,
socially compatible.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.886
- You'd sell a car...
- Please! Let's not
go through that again.

11:27.010 --> 11:28.841
I think we've worked
it out very well.

11:28.970 --> 11:31.359
Mr Douglas needs a car,
and for a very low amount down...

11:31.490 --> 11:35.483
and the usual monthly payments,
the car will become his.

11:35.610 --> 11:39.205
Very well, even though my inclination
is to have Mr Douglas clapped into jail,

11:39.330 --> 11:41.480
and this four-wheeled contrivance
dropped into the bay!

11:41.610 --> 11:46.240
- I think Mr Thorndyke
is being very fair.
- Fair? It's not fair!

11:46.370 --> 11:49.168
I'm being muscled! I want you to know
that I know it and I don't like it!

11:49.290 --> 11:50.803
I'll draw up the papers.

11:50.930 --> 11:54.047
Would you come
with me, please?

11:54.170 --> 11:56.445
Then get Mr Douglas
and his acquisition out of here...

11:56.570 --> 11:58.640
before I lose my temper!

11:58.770 --> 12:01.807
What in...

12:43.930 --> 12:46.842
What's the matter?
You from L.A. Or something?

13:02.130 --> 13:05.600
- I thought we'd run over to that
new restaurant in Marin County.

13:13.850 --> 13:15.886
Have you gone mad?

13:16.010 --> 13:18.570
Okay.
What's the joke?

13:18.690 --> 13:20.885
- What do you mean?
- I don't know how you rigged it,

13:21.010 --> 13:24.320
- but I'm sure that car's a real cutup
when a convention comes to town.
- What in the name...

13:24.450 --> 13:26.520
If I'd wanted a trick car
I would have bought one in a joke shop.

13:26.650 --> 13:29.608
Allow me to say I haven't the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

13:29.730 --> 13:32.085
You come blithering up in
that beastly little car...

13:32.210 --> 13:34.360
and assault
my personal Rolls Royce!

13:34.490 --> 13:36.287
I brought it back.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.446
I want my money,
I want the papers I signed,

13:38.570 --> 13:42.006
then I'll get out and you two clowns
can have your little laugh.

13:42.130 --> 13:44.485
Mr Douglas, if there is
anything wrong with the car,

13:44.610 --> 13:47.408
would you be good enough
to tell me what it is?

13:47.530 --> 13:51.284
It's just that that it wants to go
one way and I'd like to go the other.

13:51.410 --> 13:55.483
- Whatever it is, none of it
is covered in our guarantee.
- I'm sure of that.

13:55.610 --> 13:58.522
- If you examine paragraph 12...
- Excuse me, Mr Thorndyke.

13:58.650 --> 14:02.245
If I sold this gentleman the car
I feel a certain responsibility.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.964
Do you mind if I try it?

14:08.610 --> 14:12.489
Miss Bennett!
Our dinner engagement.

14:12.610 --> 14:14.407
I won't be a minute.

14:18.410 --> 14:20.560
Seems to be acting
all right now.

14:20.690 --> 14:25.127
Sometimes new car owners have a tendency
to exaggerate their problems.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.241
We get that all the time.

14:27.370 --> 14:29.804
Believe me, when I was
in this car alone...

14:29.930 --> 14:33.400
Just treat it gently at first.
It really is a fine automobile.

14:34.770 --> 14:38.080
Have you had much
experience with cars?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.166
Look, lady, by profession
I'm a racing driver.

14:40.290 --> 14:43.646
Oh, that Jim Douglas.

14:43.770 --> 14:46.125
What do you mean,
"That Jim Douglas"?

14:46.250 --> 14:48.639
Let's see, two years ago
at Laguna Seca...

14:48.770 --> 14:53.082
you spun out and hung a beautiful
Buick Special on the back fence.

14:53.210 --> 14:56.646
At Willow Springs,
a year ago last February,

14:56.770 --> 14:58.920
you sprayed a Lotus
all over the infield.

14:59.050 --> 15:01.564
How do you know all that?

15:01.690 --> 15:03.487
I have trouble
with names and faces,

15:03.610 --> 15:05.726
but I never forget a car.

15:05.850 --> 15:08.000
I like good machinery.

15:08.130 --> 15:09.927
Now, why don't you give
this little car a fair chance.

15:10.050 --> 15:13.008
You bought it; enjoy it.

15:13.130 --> 15:15.325
You can drive me back now.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.167
What about it, dad?

15:23.290 --> 15:26.441
Want to give that doodle bug a workout?
I'll go easy on ya.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.162
Be serious, will ya?

15:49.490 --> 15:53.199
- Did you see this thing take off?
- One of your showboat tricks.

15:53.330 --> 15:55.924
I tell you, I had nothing to do with it.
Hey, we were turning.

15:56.050 --> 15:59.520
Outta sight, man.
I wouldn't have believed it.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.447
Groovy, pop. Groovy.

16:01.570 --> 16:04.607
As long as the customer
finally seems pleased,

16:04.730 --> 16:07.164
I'll just step out
and find myself a taxi.

16:07.290 --> 16:11.442
Will you stop the car, please?

16:11.570 --> 16:14.528
I'm trying!
Look!

16:14.650 --> 16:18.245
It's just like I told you.
This thing's starting to act up again.

16:18.370 --> 16:22.045
How very odd. When I was driving there
was no problem whatsoever.

16:35.410 --> 16:38.447
I can't seem to do
anything with it!

16:38.570 --> 16:42.165
Mr Douglas, I'm asking you nicely
to pull over and let me out!

16:42.290 --> 16:44.520
Look, I'm sorry about your date,
I really am.

16:44.650 --> 16:46.880
I didn't want you to miss
your dinner engagement.

16:49.970 --> 16:52.928
What's the rush, tiger?
We got all night.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.848
Goodbye, Mr Douglas.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.567
Here, I'll help you.

17:01.690 --> 17:03.840
I can get out, thank you.

17:03.970 --> 17:06.279
What'll it be, chief?

17:06.410 --> 17:09.163
Would you mind helping the lady
get her car door open?

17:09.290 --> 17:12.362
Look, I'm busy.
And I ain't no mechanic.

17:12.490 --> 17:17.040
All I do is sell food,
and that ain't too good.
You want somethin' or don't ya?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.763
- Help!
- Two hamburgers and a coffee.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.287
Help!

17:26.410 --> 17:29.083
Can you help me, please?

17:33.290 --> 17:36.327
Help! I'm a prisoner!
I can't get out!

17:36.450 --> 17:39.840
We all prisoners,
chickie baby.

17:39.970 --> 17:41.801
We all locked in.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.927
Mmm.

17:47.050 --> 17:49.120
A couple of weirdos, Guinevere.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.006
What? Wait a minute.
Hold it, hold it.

17:53.130 --> 17:54.927
Let me open the door.

17:55.050 --> 17:56.847
Hey, knock it off,
will ya, sis?

17:56.970 --> 17:58.767
I ain't sayin' this is
the classiest joint in town,

17:58.890 --> 18:00.687
but we gotta draw
the line somewhere.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.607
Come on,
back in your seat.

18:03.970 --> 18:06.359
Why don't you go
up to Seabreeze Point?

18:06.490 --> 18:08.640
- Fuzz don't bother you much up there.
- Thanks.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.723
I wish there were some way
I could make up for those hamburgers.

18:22.850 --> 18:24.966
Mr Douglas, please
don't go on about it.

18:25.090 --> 18:28.719
I'm sure that if I were driving none
of these things would have happened.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.567
It's all yours.

18:37.730 --> 18:40.198
Now I think you'll
see what's what.

18:57.210 --> 18:59.963
This is very embarrassing.

19:00.090 --> 19:03.526
Yes, it is.

19:03.650 --> 19:07.279
- I would have preferred knowing
you a little longer first.
- Just a minute!

19:07.410 --> 19:12.325
- You don't think I drove
you here on purpose.
- Don't try to explain.

19:12.450 --> 19:15.203
- The point is you brought me here.
- I did not bring you here!

19:15.330 --> 19:18.720
It's this nasty little car.

19:18.850 --> 19:22.001
- But you said yourself
it's a very nice little car.
- And as you said,

19:22.130 --> 19:23.927
it does have some
peculiar traits.

19:24.050 --> 19:26.166
And I agree with you completely.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.124
- Bring it in tomorrow
and I'll find a replacement.
- I don't want the car replaced.

19:30.250 --> 19:35.005
As a matter of fact,
I'm beginning to like it.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.439
- Oh!
- Don't panic.

19:37.570 --> 19:40.562
Don't panic. There must be
some place I can call a taxi.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.800
Ooh!

20:25.930 --> 20:27.682
Hey!

20:33.090 --> 20:35.843
You know, for a moment
I thought you weren't going to stop.

20:37.890 --> 20:40.643
What's the matter now?

20:51.050 --> 20:53.405
Look, this is ridiculous.
Let's get back in the car, huh?

20:54.890 --> 20:56.801
Hold it.
Hold it, everybody.

20:56.930 --> 20:58.807
Just a moment, please.

21:01.810 --> 21:05.007
Something the matter?

21:05.130 --> 21:08.008
- Is this man bothering you?
- No, not exactly.

21:08.130 --> 21:11.327
It's okay.
We're together.

21:11.450 --> 21:15.204
- Is that your car?
- My...

21:15.330 --> 21:17.890
Well, yes.
Yes, it is.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.241
Okay, then.
Move along.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.003
- Hey, bud.
- Yeah?

21:28.130 --> 21:30.564
Not too smart
wandering around the park at night.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.569
- Right.
- I'll drive.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.920
She'll drive.

21:39.970 --> 21:42.643
I should have given
you a citation.

21:42.770 --> 21:44.567
You ought to have enough sense
to put your brakes on...

21:44.690 --> 21:46.920
while your car is stopped!

21:55.650 --> 21:58.608
Well then, if everything you say
about this car is true,

21:58.730 --> 22:00.800
it's already
starting to happen.

22:00.930 --> 22:04.081
- What's starting to happen?
- Us human beings.

22:04.210 --> 22:06.770
We had a chance to make something
out of this world.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.801
We blew it.
Okay.

22:08.930 --> 22:13.128
- Another kind of civilization
is gonna take a turn.
- Give me an 11-mil wrench.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.684
- I'm sitting up
on top of this mountain, right?
- Right.

22:15.810 --> 22:19.359
- I'm surrounded by these gurus
and swamis and monks, right?
- Right.

22:19.490 --> 22:21.287
- I'm lookin' at my stomach.
- Yeah.

22:21.410 --> 22:25.562
- I'm knockin' back a little rice wine.
- Um-hmm.

22:25.690 --> 22:29.399
Got some contemplation goin';
I see things like they are.

22:29.530 --> 22:31.998
- I coulda told you all this was comin'.
- What's coming?

22:32.130 --> 22:35.406
Jim, it's happening right under
our noses and we can't see it.

22:35.530 --> 22:39.284
We take machines
and stuff 'em with information
until they're smarter than we are.

22:39.410 --> 22:41.207
Take a car.

22:41.330 --> 22:44.879
Most guys spread more
love and time and money...

22:45.010 --> 22:48.844
on their car in a week than they do
on their wife and kids in a year.

22:48.970 --> 22:50.767
Pretty soon,
you know what?

22:50.890 --> 22:55.281
The machine starts
to think it is somebody.

22:55.410 --> 22:58.846
I'm not saying a mechanical thing
can't be a friend.

22:58.970 --> 23:00.926
Like, when I was
broke one summer,

23:01.050 --> 23:05.328
there was this giant claw machine
in the Sutro Amusement Park.

23:05.450 --> 23:09.159
It would grab cameras and watches
and drop them down a hole to me.

23:09.290 --> 23:11.804
- And I would hock 'em and buy lunch.
You follow me?
- Yeah.

23:11.930 --> 23:15.002
I think you were up
on that mountaintop too long.

23:15.130 --> 23:20.488
Contrariwise, the traffic light
down the street hates my guts.

23:20.610 --> 23:23.044
I don't know why.
But in the last six weeks...

23:23.170 --> 23:25.320
I haven't caught anything
but a stop signal.

23:25.450 --> 23:28.726
It makes me wait six seconds longer
than anybody else! I timed it!

23:28.850 --> 23:33.162
Things like that happen
to lots of other people too.

23:33.290 --> 23:35.087
But the other people
don't tell no other people,

23:35.210 --> 23:39.203
because the other people
would say, "Hey-ey-ey-ey. "

23:39.330 --> 23:43.960
Tennessee, that traffic light
is a lot of nuts and bolts.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.126
This little car,
a lot of nuts and bolts.

23:46.250 --> 23:49.640
Everything explains itself,
one way or the other.

23:49.770 --> 23:52.682
- You're not listenin' to me.
- Don't lose your grip, old buddy.

23:52.810 --> 23:54.801
This little car didn't do one thing
tonight that can't be explained...

23:54.930 --> 23:58.559
in terms of short circuits, sprung
doors, grabbing steering, worn knuckles,

23:58.690 --> 24:00.806
maybe some advertising gimmick.

24:00.930 --> 24:03.046
I'll fix it.

24:03.170 --> 24:06.048
- I don't think you got the picture.
- I got a beautiful picture.

24:06.170 --> 24:08.604
This baby happens to have
an extra turn of speed,

24:08.730 --> 24:11.198
which is the only thing
I care about.

24:11.330 --> 24:13.207
You don't understand
what happens, do you?

24:13.330 --> 24:16.561
They make 10,000 cars.
They make 'em exactly the same way.

24:16.690 --> 24:19.682
One or two of 'em turn out
to be something special.

24:20.970 --> 24:23.484
Nobody knows why.

24:23.610 --> 24:25.407
I know why.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.646
I may be kiddin' myself,

24:27.770 --> 24:30.364
but I think I can make somethin'
out of that sad little bucket of bolts.

24:31.810 --> 24:33.766
Save these.
They'll be famous someday.

24:40.610 --> 24:43.249
I'm your friend.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.439
Wanna take a ride? I want to check
those adjustments I made last night.

25:01.570 --> 25:03.845
- Okay.
- Be right with you.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.041
Hey! Hey, come here!

25:20.010 --> 25:22.524
All right, get outta there. Out!

25:22.650 --> 25:25.005
Come on.
Who do you guys think you are?

25:26.810 --> 25:28.880
Stop clownin' around,
will ya?

25:29.010 --> 25:32.320
Play it straight.
Don't give him any trouble.

25:32.450 --> 25:34.247
You could have
a good home here.

25:34.370 --> 25:36.679
- What's all that racket, huh?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

25:36.810 --> 25:38.607
Oh. Hop in.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.758
What'd I tell ya?
Now it handles good.

25:59.890 --> 26:02.643
- All the bugs are gone.
- Herbie's all right.

26:02.770 --> 26:05.330
- Who's Herbie?
- This little car.

26:05.450 --> 26:07.441
Named after my Uncle Herb.

26:07.570 --> 26:10.209
He used to box middleweight.
Preliminary, mostly.

26:10.330 --> 26:12.924
Gradually, his nose got
shaped more and more...

26:13.050 --> 26:15.439
like to remind me of this little car.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.845
- Do you mind?
- Whatever you say, Tennessee.

26:17.970 --> 26:20.359
Herbie.

26:24.970 --> 26:27.643
- I'll take 'em.
- Thank you, sir.

26:27.770 --> 26:29.806
- Now, what's that for?
- An oil job.

26:29.930 --> 26:33.525
- Huh?
- I got a small knock in my conscience.

26:33.650 --> 26:35.447
Thanks.

26:53.610 --> 26:55.646
Now we get down to business.

26:55.770 --> 26:57.840
- You gonna race?
- What do you think?

26:57.970 --> 26:59.847
Oh, boy!
Won't Herbie love that!

26:59.970 --> 27:01.801
Le Mans, Monte Carlo.

27:01.930 --> 27:05.047
Thrills, glamour,
the roar of the crowd!

27:31.890 --> 27:34.404
He really does drive.

27:34.530 --> 27:36.486
If you could give me one good reason
for bringing me down...

27:36.610 --> 27:38.680
to this ridiculous desert, I...

27:45.250 --> 27:47.844
Isn't that the scruffy little car
we had in the shop?

27:52.570 --> 27:54.367
Now we're goin'!

28:02.530 --> 28:05.203
You're doin' terrific, Herbie,

28:05.330 --> 28:07.798
but don't make it look too easy.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.761
Play it smart.

28:12.650 --> 28:15.960
Okay, Jim! Go ahead!
You're murderin' 'em!

28:30.050 --> 28:32.484
So, who cares?
I'll tell you one thing.

28:32.610 --> 28:35.727
I certainly don't intend
losing any sleep over that absurd car.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.648
Come on. Come on!

28:52.610 --> 28:55.329
Now, Herbie!
Now! Now!

29:05.210 --> 29:09.840
The winner, #53:
Jim Douglas, driving a Class-D Special.

29:09.970 --> 29:11.767
- Congratulations.
- Good race, Jim.

29:11.890 --> 29:14.962
- Thanks, Ray.
- Boy, was Herbie ever great today.

29:15.090 --> 29:17.399
I was out there too. Wouldn't you say
that was a fair piece of driving?

29:17.530 --> 29:19.407
Hey, I'm not trying to take
anything away from you,

29:19.530 --> 29:22.090
but you gotta admit that this little guy
backed you all the way.

29:22.210 --> 29:24.280
Yeah.
It's a nice little car.

29:24.410 --> 29:26.207
You know somethin' else?

29:26.330 --> 29:30.243
For the first time in a long while,
I felt my real self out there.

29:30.370 --> 29:33.328
A sense of authority like
the top drivers have, you know?

29:33.450 --> 29:35.600
I kinda felt you felt that.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.244
Tennessee, I wouldn't admit this
to anybody else, but...

29:38.370 --> 29:43.364
I was beginnin' to think
I'd never be anything more
than a piston-happy, lead foot punk.

29:44.770 --> 29:46.601
Then this starts to happen.

29:46.730 --> 29:48.527
I'm glad for you, Jim.

29:48.650 --> 29:50.606
You know that.

29:50.730 --> 29:52.527
Well, hello.

29:52.650 --> 29:56.006
I see you finally learned how to
handle this car. Congratulations.

29:56.130 --> 29:59.042
- Thank you.
- What have you done to this thing?

29:59.170 --> 30:01.206
Oh, an adjustment here,
an adjustment there.

30:01.330 --> 30:03.446
You want to sell it back?
I own most of it anyway, you know.

30:03.570 --> 30:05.686
Still 23 payments to go.

30:05.810 --> 30:07.607
- Well, uh...
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

30:07.730 --> 30:10.767
I'll take the car and give you
$1,000 clear. What do you say?

30:10.890 --> 30:12.801
No. You don't wanna do that.

30:12.930 --> 30:15.444
It's all right, Tennessee.
I know what I'm doing.

30:15.570 --> 30:18.687
I think Mr Thorndyke
is a little mixed up
as to who or what won that race.

30:18.810 --> 30:21.040
- And what does that mean?
- Someday, I'll teach you...

30:21.170 --> 30:23.400
not to confuse the car
with the driver.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.407
I should welcome the opportunity.

30:25.530 --> 30:28.283
Mr Thorndyke, I think
that's a very good idea of yours.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.799
- What is?
- You're racing in the Libra Open...

30:30.930 --> 30:33.080
- at Riverside
at the end of the month, right?
- Yes.

30:33.210 --> 30:35.007
Well, I'm sure that
Mr Douglas would like to get...

30:35.130 --> 30:37.200
- the remainder
of his payments off his back.
- No doubt.

30:37.330 --> 30:39.002
But why should I think
that's a good idea?

30:39.130 --> 30:41.325
Well, if Mr Douglas
entered the race,

30:41.450 --> 30:44.647
he could bet his share of the little car
against the remaining payments.

30:44.770 --> 30:46.726
What do you say, Douglas?

30:46.850 --> 30:50.843
The winner to become
the sole owner of the car.

30:54.490 --> 30:57.004
A moment ago, you mentioned
teaching me a lesson.

30:57.130 --> 30:59.519
Do I now detect
a note of timidity?

31:01.050 --> 31:04.008
Racing. That's the name
of the game, isn't it?

31:04.130 --> 31:06.439
Win or lose.
Put up or shut up.

31:06.570 --> 31:09.403
- You got yourself a deal, Thorndyke.
- Splendid.

31:12.290 --> 31:15.043
The drivers' meeting is over.
Now, the third race of the afternoon...

31:15.170 --> 31:17.081
will get under way
here at Riverside.

31:17.210 --> 31:20.520
You keep your eye on your friend
in the Bug, my dear.

31:20.650 --> 31:22.447
I'm going to squash him.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.728
Clear the grid, please.

31:26.090 --> 31:29.127
I can't help feelin' yippy.
If anything goes wrong,
we'll lose Herbie altogether.

31:29.250 --> 31:32.526
- I thought you were the guy
with all the faith in this car.
- Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

31:32.650 --> 31:34.925
And now the starter
has his flag in the air.

31:35.050 --> 31:37.325
The engines are started,

31:37.450 --> 31:40.248
and in just a moment,
we'll have the start.

31:40.370 --> 31:43.328
All the cars looking
very smart on the grid.

31:43.450 --> 31:46.760
Drivers in the first row
signifying that they're ready to race.

31:46.890 --> 31:49.848
Their hands extended in the air.
The flag is up, and there they go!

32:02.010 --> 32:05.798
Cars stretching out now. All cars off
the starting grid and through turn one.

32:08.210 --> 32:10.929
Through the S's now.

32:19.410 --> 32:23.881
Down the back straight, well by himself
now, is the #14 car of Thorndyke...

32:24.010 --> 32:26.570
going into the sweeper turn.

32:26.690 --> 32:30.046
The rest of the field well stretched out
as they charge down the back straight.

32:33.090 --> 32:35.684
Not yet, Herbie!
Not yet!

32:41.570 --> 32:45.961
The standings in lap 23: Thorndyke,
still leading; Lesser, running second;

32:46.090 --> 32:48.206
and Erwin in third place.

32:52.850 --> 32:55.364
Now, Herbie! Now!

33:01.010 --> 33:04.685
Now, car #53... Douglas...
starts to make a move,

33:04.810 --> 33:07.040
picking up cars
as he goes by car #20.

33:07.170 --> 33:10.719
Into the sweeper,
very hard and fast.

33:10.850 --> 33:13.842
Going through traffic,
passing #23 now...

33:13.970 --> 33:17.201
is car #53... Douglas.

33:17.330 --> 33:21.767
He has just come alive
and is making a challenge in this race.

33:21.890 --> 33:24.802
Passing cars as he goes down
the back straight,

33:24.930 --> 33:28.525
car #53... Douglas...
making his bid.

33:28.650 --> 33:33.440
Into the straight now
is Thorndyke, car #14.

33:33.570 --> 33:38.849
Now the pressure's on. Douglas in #53
is starting to close on Thorndyke, #14.

33:40.170 --> 33:41.967
Douglas has just come alive...

33:42.090 --> 33:44.285
and is pressing the leader now.

33:46.010 --> 33:48.922
Now making his bid to pass,
but he can't get by.

33:49.050 --> 33:53.202
He's being shut off
by Thorndyke in the #14 car.

34:01.970 --> 34:03.961
Douglas goes slightly off course,
takes out some markers...

34:04.090 --> 34:07.969
and apparently is out of control,

34:08.090 --> 34:11.764
He crashes into the #4 shutoff marker.

34:11.889 --> 34:15.599
Thorndyke continuing on
as the #53 car lets this one...

34:15.730 --> 34:17.527
Now he's making
his reentry!

34:24.170 --> 34:26.161
Look out!

34:32.929 --> 34:35.080
- Hey, nice scoring, champ.
- Thank you very much.

34:35.210 --> 34:37.599
Hey, what a champ.
Way to drive.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.607
Just a moment, Mr Thorndyke.
You don't have...

34:41.730 --> 34:44.085
I demand that this thing
is impounded and checked!

34:44.210 --> 34:47.327
- I tell you there's more going
on here than meets the eye!

36:08.170 --> 36:09.967
Muchas gracias,
señor.

36:10.090 --> 36:12.445
Gracias.
A usted tambien.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.640
¡Ya consiguió un gorrito
el pelado!

36:14.770 --> 36:17.682
¿Cómo está maestro?
¡Oye se ríe!

37:27.650 --> 37:30.403
You don't look well
in these pictures lately.

37:30.530 --> 37:33.522
How could I look well?
I haven't been able to sleep.

37:33.650 --> 37:36.847
That rotten car
is driving me piffy!

37:36.970 --> 37:40.326
Has it occurred to you
it may not be the rotten car?

37:40.450 --> 37:43.248
- Perhaps it's the way Mr Douglas drives.
- Balderdash!

37:43.370 --> 37:46.840
There isn't a driver in the world
who can get that speed
out of a car like that.

37:46.970 --> 37:48.847
No, he's done something to it,

37:48.970 --> 37:50.881
and I've got to find out what!

37:51.010 --> 37:52.807
You've become obsessed
by this whole thing.

37:52.930 --> 37:56.605
There are other cars, other races.
Why don't you just forget it?

37:59.330 --> 38:02.402
My dear child,
how little you know me.

38:02.530 --> 38:06.125
- Yes, Mr Thorndyke.
- Carole?

38:06.250 --> 38:09.925
- How long have you been with us?
- A year and a half, almost two. Why?

38:10.050 --> 38:12.086
I'm afraid I've been
a little remiss...

38:12.210 --> 38:15.885
in not telling you before now how very
well you've proved in all your duties.

38:16.010 --> 38:17.807
Well, thank you.

38:17.930 --> 38:21.889
And, Carole, as I realize
you have the best interests
of this organization at heart,

38:22.010 --> 38:24.729
I want you to accede
to a somewhat unusual request.

38:24.850 --> 38:28.320
Oh?

38:28.450 --> 38:30.680
Peter Thorndyke.

38:30.810 --> 38:32.766
It's for you.

38:32.890 --> 38:35.085
All right.
You can take it here.

38:35.210 --> 38:37.007
Thank you.

38:37.130 --> 38:38.927
Yes, good afternoon.

38:41.410 --> 38:44.561
Oh, I think that
should be quite all right.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.158
Uh, 7:30 will be fine.

38:47.290 --> 38:49.679
Yes. Uh, bye.

38:49.810 --> 38:52.563
- I think I'll...
- I'd like you to see this Douglas,
get to know him.

38:52.690 --> 38:55.443
Who knows? If he has the talents
of which I believe him capable,

38:55.570 --> 38:57.367
perhaps we can give him
the opportunity...

38:57.490 --> 38:59.321
of joining our organization,
racing under our colours.

38:59.450 --> 39:02.044
- But first, we must know
something about him.
- How about tonight?

39:02.170 --> 39:04.001
- Very good.
- At 7:30?

39:04.130 --> 39:06.928
Very good!
Why waste time?

39:07.050 --> 39:09.006
Oh, and Carole,
another thing.

39:09.130 --> 39:12.361
Leave your car. Take the Special.
He likes that one.

39:12.490 --> 39:16.244
Uh, thank you.

39:16.370 --> 39:18.804
I think I ought to tell you that
that was Mr Douglas who just called.

39:18.930 --> 39:20.966
Excellent.
Strike while the iron is hot.

39:21.090 --> 39:23.206
In all honesty,
I should like to point out...

39:23.330 --> 39:26.163
that I agreed to have dinner with him
before you suggested it.

39:26.290 --> 39:28.440
I salute your honesty, my dear...

39:28.570 --> 39:31.687
a quality not necessarily
to be despised.

39:33.050 --> 39:34.847
Thank you.

39:34.970 --> 39:37.120
A very loyal girl.

39:40.170 --> 39:43.526
- Got Herbie all polished out for ya.
- Uh, Carole Bennett called back.

39:43.650 --> 39:47.199
- She's going to pick me up
in the Special.
- You're not takin' Herbie?

39:47.330 --> 39:50.128
He's looking forward to some relaxation
just like you are.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.081
The car is...

39:52.210 --> 39:55.998
- See you later, Tennessee.
- Some thanks
after what Herbie did for you.

40:02.290 --> 40:05.839
Don't let it get ya, Herbie.
Jim didn't mean it.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.120
Don't forget: He isn't the first guy
ever to lose his head...

40:08.250 --> 40:10.047
over a bucket seat
and a paint job.

40:10.170 --> 40:14.209
He'll come to his senses.

40:14.330 --> 40:17.720
- Good evening.
- Sorry. The other rats
are out for the evening!

40:17.850 --> 40:20.318
No, no! Please.
I didn't come by to see Mr Douglas.

40:20.450 --> 40:24.648
- I came by to pay my respects
to that gallant little car.
- Huh?

40:24.770 --> 40:27.364
There it is.

40:27.490 --> 40:30.641
- What a marvel it is, indeed.
- I don't get you, fella.

40:30.770 --> 40:34.126
Oh, come, come, sir. I know
a rare bit of machinery when I see one.

40:34.250 --> 40:36.445
And after all,
who should know it better than I?

40:36.570 --> 40:39.926
I, who have been trounced
time and again by this... this paragon.

40:40.050 --> 40:41.847
You'll forgive me
for saying so, sir,

40:41.970 --> 40:45.246
but it does take class to know
when it has been defeated by class.

40:45.370 --> 40:49.363
You know somethin', Mr Thorndyke?
I may have misjudged you.

40:49.490 --> 40:53.369
- Well, thank you.
- I've been misjudging
a lot of people lately.

40:53.490 --> 40:55.765
Would you like a drink?
Some Irish coffee?

40:55.890 --> 40:57.926
Specialty of the house.
My own mother's recipe.

40:58.050 --> 41:00.928
- That's very kind of you.
I'd love it. Thank you.
- I'll be back in a jiffy!

41:01.050 --> 41:03.769
That's most kind.
Thank you so much.

41:03.890 --> 41:08.759
It's just incredible, isn't it, to think
that this innocent-seeming object...

41:08.890 --> 41:13.122
is, is capable
of such great deeds.

41:13.250 --> 41:17.289
How, indeed.

41:17.410 --> 41:20.163
The trick is, always remember
to have asbestos gloves...

41:20.290 --> 41:22.565
when you make coffee this way.

41:22.690 --> 41:24.487
Fascinating. Yes.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.680
Yes. Quite...
Quite fascinating.

41:34.250 --> 41:37.003
Here we go.

41:39.170 --> 41:42.560
Oh. How very refreshing.

41:42.690 --> 41:45.284
Oh, thank you.

41:45.410 --> 41:49.403
- Up the Irish.
- To the little car, a gallant adversary.

41:49.530 --> 41:53.239
- And may the best car win at Riverside.
- May the best car win.

41:56.050 --> 41:59.167
Oh, that's very good, isn't it?
Very good, indeed.

42:06.330 --> 42:09.322
- Like it?
- What do you think?

42:11.490 --> 42:14.880
I can't stand that hungry look
any longer.

42:15.010 --> 42:16.966
Take over.

42:21.090 --> 42:23.684
You know what I said to myself
the first time I saw you?

42:23.810 --> 42:27.564
- What?
- I said to myself,
"Now, there's a real lady. "

42:31.850 --> 42:35.843
This is how it ought to be...
me and these kind of wheels.

42:35.970 --> 42:39.565
Excuse me asking, but aren't you
doing all right with the little car?

42:39.690 --> 42:44.366
Sure, but can you imagine how
I'd make it with equipment like this?

42:44.490 --> 42:47.926
Is it so important to you?

42:48.050 --> 42:51.406
Without a real car,
I'm only half a man.

42:55.090 --> 42:58.048
What part of Ireland did you say
your mother came from?

42:59.890 --> 43:04.361
Coney Ireland.

43:06.050 --> 43:09.281
I'm going to make some more coffee.

43:41.890 --> 43:45.599
Oh, uh, would you like a spot of this?

43:45.730 --> 43:48.767
- I like a spot of anything.
- I'm so sorry.

43:48.890 --> 43:50.926
Now, we're gonna drink to Herbie,

43:51.050 --> 43:53.723
- The greatest little car
in the whole world.
- Yes. Quite right.

43:53.850 --> 43:56.728
- Mm-hmm.
- Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

43:56.850 --> 43:59.683
- To Herbie.
- To Herbie. So sorry about your hand.

43:59.810 --> 44:02.278
I do apologize.
To Herbie.

44:07.330 --> 44:09.525
What do you know?
The engine stalled.

44:11.130 --> 44:13.280
How about that?
The door's stuck.

44:13.410 --> 44:17.119
- Mmm.
- That's how it is with cars sometimes.

44:17.250 --> 44:20.606
- Yes.
- I guess we'll have to wait
and see what happens next.

44:20.730 --> 44:23.688
Well, as someone
very wisely once said,

44:23.810 --> 44:26.722
"That's how it is
with cars sometimes. "

44:26.850 --> 44:30.126
- I just said that.
- Oh.

44:32.850 --> 44:36.729
I wonder if your reputation
is altogether true.

44:36.850 --> 44:38.920
What's my reputation?

44:39.050 --> 44:42.963
Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas is only
interested in fast cars and easy money.

44:43.090 --> 44:44.887
Not true.

44:45.010 --> 44:46.841
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

44:46.970 --> 44:49.120
- You know something else?
- What?

44:49.250 --> 44:51.969
When the light
hits you just right,

44:52.090 --> 44:55.082
you're as beautiful
as General Grant on a $50 bill.

45:06.610 --> 45:08.407
Oh, dear me.

45:11.890 --> 45:15.439
You wanna know the secret
of the little car?

45:15.570 --> 45:18.038
I do, indeed.

45:18.170 --> 45:21.765
- I'll tell ya
the secret of the little car.
- No, no, no. Just a minute.

45:23.810 --> 45:26.199
All right. Tell me.

45:26.330 --> 45:28.685
It's heart.

45:28.810 --> 45:31.244
That's what it is: Heart.

45:32.570 --> 45:34.606
Heart. Yes.

45:34.730 --> 45:38.120
Well, I'm certainly going
to make a note of that.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.406
- Headache gone?
- All gone.

45:50.530 --> 45:54.079
Anticipation of victory
is the purest form of aspirin.

45:54.210 --> 45:59.204
- This is my day.
- Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.

45:59.330 --> 46:03.403
- You seem very confident.
- You know, I believe I am.

46:09.010 --> 46:13.925
They leave the
starting grid, going into turn one.

46:14.050 --> 46:15.847
The field's stretching out now.

46:15.970 --> 46:20.441
Everybody getting through
turn one very nicely.

46:20.570 --> 46:23.323
Very fine field of cars here.

46:23.450 --> 46:27.682
And coming through traffic now, making a
move, is Peter Thorndyke in the #14 car.

46:27.810 --> 46:29.607
Picking up a few cars
in that turn.

46:29.730 --> 46:33.166
Now he comes by and picks up three
more cars, going into the lead now.

46:33.290 --> 46:37.488
Thorndyke leading this race
in car #14.

46:37.610 --> 46:39.680
Now making a move
is car #53, Douglas,

46:39.810 --> 46:43.519
who also picks up about three cars
as he goes charging through traffic...

46:43.650 --> 46:47.848
and is in hot pursuit
of Thorndyke in the #14 car.

46:47.970 --> 46:51.201
As they go down the back straight,
comin' on pretty hard and fast...

46:51.330 --> 46:54.800
is car #53 making the pass.

46:54.930 --> 46:57.364
Attaway, Jimmy boy!

46:57.490 --> 47:00.323
Go, Jimmy!

47:03.570 --> 47:06.960
So far, Jim Douglas seems to have
everything pretty much to himself.

47:07.090 --> 47:09.843
He comes through the S's
into turn six well in control...

47:27.090 --> 47:30.048
As they come down the back straight,
Douglas is slowing down...

47:30.170 --> 47:33.401
and Thorndyke goes rocketing by
into the sweeper turn.

47:36.170 --> 47:38.320
It looks as though the Douglas car
is having trouble.

47:38.450 --> 47:41.442
Yes, #53 is fading fast.

47:41.570 --> 47:44.130
It is developing a problem
of some kind.

47:50.930 --> 47:53.922
Come in! Come in!

47:54.050 --> 47:57.565
Come in!

48:02.850 --> 48:04.806
Irish coffee.

48:39.890 --> 48:42.324
I'll be here all night
if necessary.

48:42.450 --> 48:44.406
I can take any amount of this.
Right. There we are.

48:44.530 --> 48:48.728
Don't worry, little guy.
You'll be home soon.

48:48.850 --> 48:51.125
There we are.
Right. Right you are.

48:51.250 --> 48:55.243
Do you mind standing clear? They want
me on my own. I'll see you in a minute.

49:08.130 --> 49:10.849
Poor little fella.
You got a temperature.

49:10.970 --> 49:13.564
Don't worry.
Jim'll be back soon.

49:13.690 --> 49:17.239
He never would've left if it
hadn't been somethin' important.

49:20.730 --> 49:23.927
I know. Nothing worse
than an Irish coffee hangover.

49:24.050 --> 49:26.041
That you, Jim?

49:29.690 --> 49:32.841
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure. Come on.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.484
I wouldn't blame you
if you threw me out.

49:35.610 --> 49:37.521
On account of what Thorndyke did?

49:37.650 --> 49:42.201
How can I blame anyone? Thorndyke ruined
the little car right under my nose.

49:47.210 --> 49:49.087
- Where's Jim?
- Don't know.

49:49.210 --> 49:52.407
He went out as soon as we got back.
Didn't say a word.

49:52.530 --> 49:54.282
Left Herbie and me flat.

49:54.410 --> 49:56.878
Doesn't he take care
of his car after a race?

49:57.010 --> 49:58.966
Can you do something?

50:00.210 --> 50:02.041
Like what?

50:02.170 --> 50:05.048
Well, h-help the little car.

50:05.170 --> 50:07.286
I'm not a mechanic,
but I think it's suffering.

50:08.930 --> 50:11.239
- Suffering?
- Please.

50:13.930 --> 50:16.285
- Mind if I use those coveralls?
- Right.

50:16.410 --> 50:21.006
Oh, uh, look. I wanna tell you
so you don't have to worry.

50:21.130 --> 50:24.725
I'm not with Peter Thorndyke any more.
I don't think his way.

50:24.850 --> 50:27.410
- Oh, I know that.
- How do you know?

50:27.530 --> 50:30.727
Well, Herbie wouldn't like you
otherwise.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.919
Herbie wouldn't like me?

50:35.050 --> 50:38.087
Miss Bennett, I gotta...
I gotta level with somebody.

50:38.210 --> 50:41.407
I can't talk to Jim.
It would destroy him.

50:41.530 --> 50:44.647
You don't know what it was like
before the little car came along.

50:44.770 --> 50:48.001
Jim was defeated. It was murder.
He couldn't get a job.

50:48.130 --> 50:51.247
He got into trouble.
Everybody was on his back.

50:51.370 --> 50:55.079
Then, Herbie came into his life.
Do you remember that day?

50:56.250 --> 50:58.081
I remember.

50:58.210 --> 51:01.008
Well, Jim started
winnin' races again.

51:01.130 --> 51:03.803
He got
his self-respect back.

51:03.930 --> 51:08.367
What am I gonna do? Tell him that it was
Herbie winning those races, not him?

51:10.770 --> 51:13.762
- Uh, was it Herbie?
- Well, I...

51:15.450 --> 51:18.999
You fix the little car.
I'll tell ya what's goin' on.

51:19.130 --> 51:21.121
I didn't know nothin'.

51:21.250 --> 51:23.206
Then I went to Tibet.

51:23.330 --> 51:26.208
I plugged into
this contemplation thing.

51:31.170 --> 51:34.128
- How's that sound?
- Like the song of a bluebird.

51:36.770 --> 51:40.558
Well, the fuel lines are clean.
The plugs are clean. Wiring checks out.

51:40.690 --> 51:42.487
Looks like we're
in pretty good shape.

51:42.610 --> 51:45.363
Herbie and I
sure appreciate it.

51:47.250 --> 51:51.038
You don't believe a word I said
about this little car, do ya?

51:52.610 --> 51:54.407
Well, there's always a first time.

51:55.850 --> 51:57.727
I imagine Adam thought woman...

51:57.850 --> 52:00.808
was a pretty funny piece of equipment
when he met Eve.

52:00.930 --> 52:05.048
Well, that's a start. You can't believe
it all right away. It takes time.

52:33.850 --> 52:36.284
- Hello there.
- Hi.
- What's this?

52:36.410 --> 52:38.719
- You ever see anything so beautiful?
- Very nice.

52:38.850 --> 52:41.000
What's the big idea?
You already got a car.

52:41.130 --> 52:43.519
- Not after what happened today, I don't.
- Aw, shut up.

52:43.650 --> 52:47.245
- You want Herbie to hear you?
- Don't start that again, Tennessee.

52:47.370 --> 52:49.326
Look, the El Dorado is coming up.

52:49.450 --> 52:52.760
There are real cars lined up in there.
I need something that can cut it.

52:52.890 --> 52:54.721
- Herbie's cut it so far, hasn't he?
- Of course he has!

52:54.850 --> 52:57.887
Now hold it, you two. I've done great
with this little car so far,

52:58.010 --> 53:01.844
thanks to a few changes I made,
and if you don't mind,
some pretty fair country drivin'.

53:01.970 --> 53:04.359
But... I gotta
stop kiddin' myself.

53:04.490 --> 53:08.722
I need a big, strong car.
Now I got it.

53:10.330 --> 53:13.128
Don't pay any attention.
Don't even look at it.

53:16.170 --> 53:18.730
Hello.

53:18.850 --> 53:20.761
Peter Thorndyke here.

53:20.890 --> 53:23.484
Well, well.

53:23.610 --> 53:26.920
Yeah, I know what you did to my car.
You need your brains kicked out.

53:27.050 --> 53:29.086
Oh, you can imagine
how I must feel.

53:29.210 --> 53:32.725
You see, I'm simply not responsible when
I've been drinking. You know how it is.

53:32.850 --> 53:35.603
- Forget it, and goodbye.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

53:35.730 --> 53:39.882
I understand from a friend of mine that
you purchased a new Lamborghini today.

53:40.010 --> 53:44.162
- So?
- I'm also informed that you owe
a great deal of money on it.

53:44.290 --> 53:47.680
Now, myself, for sentimental reasons,
I like the little car,

53:47.810 --> 53:50.722
and I am perfectly willing
to increase my previous offer...

53:50.850 --> 53:53.045
and give you $1,500 for it.

53:53.170 --> 53:56.879
Now. Immediately.
I'm in the vicinity.

53:57.010 --> 54:00.889
Thorndyke, I don't like you,
but I can use your money.

54:01.010 --> 54:02.841
You got yourself a deal.
Come and get it.

54:02.970 --> 54:05.723
- What do you mean, "A deal"?
- I'm selling the little car.

54:05.850 --> 54:08.205
- You're what?
- Don't make a fuss.

54:08.330 --> 54:10.286
I need the money.

54:10.410 --> 54:12.241
You crumb!
You can't do that to Herbie!

54:14.290 --> 54:17.646
Carole, will you tell him how it is
out in the real world?

54:17.770 --> 54:20.079
Me? Huh! Well!

54:20.210 --> 54:23.725
Near as I can figure it,
I'm not too smart either.

54:23.850 --> 54:26.284
I get rid of one heel
just in time to find another.

54:26.410 --> 54:30.005
Well, now, what happened to you?
I thought you'd be on my side.

54:30.130 --> 54:32.280
Not when you do something
like this to Herbie.

54:35.250 --> 54:37.559
Has everybody gone nuts
around here?

54:37.690 --> 54:41.000
I can understand how Tennessee feels.
He's just in off a flying saucer.

54:41.130 --> 54:43.166
But you...
I thought you made sense.

54:43.290 --> 54:47.363
Something tells me it's very,
very wrong to sell that little car.

54:47.490 --> 54:51.039
Thank you for your opinion, but what
am I supposed to do? I need the money.

54:51.170 --> 54:54.048
- Tennessee, if I don't sell the car...
- Don't talk to me.

54:56.930 --> 55:01.162
I'm s... I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have butted in.

55:01.290 --> 55:03.087
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

55:03.210 --> 55:07.522
As a matter of fact, I don't know...
What are you doing here?

55:07.650 --> 55:11.484
I wish I knew.
I really wish I knew!

55:13.610 --> 55:17.523
If I weren't so young and innocent,
a certain thought might enter my mind.

55:17.650 --> 55:20.448
- Such as?
- Such as you went out
with me last night...

55:20.570 --> 55:22.720
so that Thorndyke could get
a shot at the little car.

55:22.850 --> 55:24.841
Is that what you think?

55:24.970 --> 55:27.723
- Got to admit, it's tempting.
- Okay.

55:27.850 --> 55:30.125
Okay. You wanna know
what I was doing here?

55:30.250 --> 55:32.320
Well, I felt sorry
about what happened today.

55:32.450 --> 55:35.362
So I quit Thorndyke and came over here
like a full-grown idiot...

55:35.490 --> 55:37.526
to find out
if I could make up for it.

55:37.650 --> 55:40.562
Isn't that
"Dial a beautiful thought for the day"?
Very touching. Makes me glow.

55:44.250 --> 55:47.640
I think it's about time someone
told you what the score is.

55:47.770 --> 55:49.169
Tennessee's too tenderhearted.

55:49.290 --> 55:51.485
You really think it was you
winning those races?

55:51.610 --> 55:55.080
Yes, I think it was me winning...
What do you mean it wasn't me
winning those races?

55:55.210 --> 55:58.327
- Pardon me.
- You want me to tell you something,
my windbag friend?

55:58.450 --> 56:01.123
I admit, I didn't believe it
when Tennessee told me before,

56:01.250 --> 56:03.241
but now I see it makes
all kinds of sense.

56:03.370 --> 56:06.646
- W-W-What?
- That thimble head of yours
has gotten all swelled up.

56:06.770 --> 56:08.601
You're not winning any of those races.

56:08.730 --> 56:11.324
You couldn't win a game of marbles
from a 12-toed myopic rhinoceros!

56:11.450 --> 56:13.918
Will you knock it off out there,
Tennessee? Can't hear myself think.

56:14.050 --> 56:16.848
I'm not out there, crumb.
I'm here.

56:16.970 --> 56:18.847
Well, hold it down. I'll...

56:22.370 --> 56:24.964
Well, then what's this noise?

56:28.250 --> 56:30.081
No!

56:32.090 --> 56:35.048
Stop it! Stop it!
You don't know what you're doin'!

56:35.170 --> 56:37.126
Look! Look what
it did to my car.

56:37.250 --> 56:39.889
- Okay, maybe it was a little jealous.
- Of course it's jealous.

56:40.010 --> 56:42.922
It's always been jealous because
I get credit for winning those races!

56:46.370 --> 56:48.838
Go on.
Realize what you're sayin'?

57:21.450 --> 57:24.328
At a time like this,
whatever kind of time it is,

57:24.450 --> 57:27.044
I always say that money
serves to ease the pain.

57:29.010 --> 57:31.763
Good evening, my dear.
Here you are, sir.

57:31.890 --> 57:34.962
Fifteen hundred dollars for
the small car, just as I promised.

57:35.090 --> 57:36.887
I note it's not
in mint condition,

57:37.010 --> 57:39.319
but I am nothing
if not always a man of my word.

57:41.050 --> 57:44.599
Uh, uh, 2,000.
What about 2,000?

57:44.730 --> 57:48.439
It's the least I can do to help
a fellow human at a time like this.

57:48.570 --> 57:50.845
Shall we consider it a deal?

57:54.050 --> 57:56.803
- Two thousand dollars?
- Yes.

57:56.930 --> 58:02.084
Two thousand dollars
for that little beat-up car? Why?

58:02.210 --> 58:06.249
Well, you could say I have a warm place
in my heart for the dear little thing.

58:06.370 --> 58:09.726
You don't have a warm place on your
whole body. What do you want it for?

58:09.850 --> 58:13.081
You don't want it; I do.
Take the money.

58:13.210 --> 58:15.565
- You... You too!
- Now, look, Douglas,
there's no need to be abusive.

58:15.690 --> 58:18.079
- I'm trying to give you some money!
- I don't want your money!

58:18.210 --> 58:20.485
What do you want the car for?

58:20.610 --> 58:22.521
You believe it.
You believe it too!

58:22.650 --> 58:26.006
- Believe what?
- Jim, it don't matter whether
you believe Herbie or not.

58:27.490 --> 58:29.367
Herbie don't believe
in you no more.

58:29.490 --> 58:31.208
Huh?

58:35.010 --> 58:36.807
Where'd he go?
Where is he?

58:36.930 --> 58:38.886
Took off.
What do you expect?

58:39.010 --> 58:42.764
- Well, come on. Let's find him.
- This is a private thing
between the two of you.

58:42.890 --> 58:44.687
Good luck.

58:47.730 --> 58:51.803
Herbie?
Herbie!

58:54.970 --> 58:57.404
A rum lot you've
taken up with, my dear.

59:06.090 --> 59:08.684
You'd better find that car
before I do, my friend.

59:08.810 --> 59:12.325
- Operator.
- Mobile KQX-2942.

59:12.450 --> 59:14.406
I want 567-3998.

59:15.930 --> 59:18.285
Havershaw, I shall
require the personnel...

59:18.410 --> 59:21.083
of both our day
and night shifts.

59:21.210 --> 59:23.201
We have a small task to perform.

59:26.050 --> 59:27.847
Herbie?

59:32.530 --> 59:34.327
Herbie!

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.087
That's it.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.560
Herbie!

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:05.927
Excuse me.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:12.680
- Havershaw, tear it apart!
- All right, boys.

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.199
You heard Mr Thorndyke.
Tear it apart.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.844
I'm gonna find out what makes it tick!

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.168
- After it!
- After it!

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.366
Go on!
Grab the brute!

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:31.721
Hang on to it, you fools!
Hang on!

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:06.239
Herbie!

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.041
Give me police station.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.081
Hello, police station?

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.484
Herbie?

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:29.209
Hey, you...

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:39.520
- Did a little car come by here?
- Yeah, just did, without payin' the...

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:54.127
No, Herbie, don't!

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:02.687
Herbie!

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:14.086
Herb, back up!
Herbie!

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:17.202
Come on, baby. It's gonna
be a beautiful day tomorrow.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:20.604
Aaah!

01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:27.042
Herbie, give me some help.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:30.644
Herb?

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:32.886
I can't hang on much longer.

01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:50.680
Boy, was he lucky.
This little car saved his life.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:52.607
What do you mean,
the car saved his life?

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.721
That's what it looked like
for a moment there. L...

01:04:56.890 --> 01:05:02.248
You know how funny
things can look i-in the fog sometimes.

01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:06.329
- I think you've been up on that
Haight-Ashbury beat too long.

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:29.128
Swing that light over here.

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.567
Aha!

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:02.968
- What's that thing?
- It's a dried squid, Sergeant.

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:06.087
Hmm.

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.400
Here's the damages.
Can you pay it?

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:27.045
- I'm sorry. I have no money.
- Then your car will be impounded.

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:32.608
My guess is the judge will order you
to sell it at auction
and the proceeds given to Mr Wu.

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:35.608
Wait a minute.
May I speak to the gentleman, please?

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:38.722
I spent some time up on
a Chinese-type mountain...

01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:40.681
teachin' English to some of 'em.

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.607
You taught English?

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:44.846
Let's don't get personal.

01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:47.643
It's a matter of talkin'
their language.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.604
You have a little feel for tradition
and some courtesy, you'd be surprised.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:54.244
You can unscrew the "unscrutable. "

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:56.486
Go ahead.

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:20.441
Ah. Ah, ah, ah.

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:50.965
Herbie-la!

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:52.489
- Herbie?
- Herbie!

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:55.607
- Ho!
- Ho!

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:59.120
- Things are shapin' up. He's a car buff.
- Good, good.

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.559
- Wow.
- What's the matter?

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.487
We just got a new problem.

01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.965
He likes the car so much
he wants to keep it.

01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.680
Okay, the car is his, but he has
to let me drive it in the El Dorado.

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:22.278
If I win, tell him
he gets to keep the prize money,

01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:24.446
but he has to sell Herbie
back to me for a dollar.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:27.761
Now you speak my language.

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:40.645
Attention: Drivers
and owners report to Mr Granatelli...

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:42.965
at the president's headquarters.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:47.002
Further, you must remain
on the secondary roads
which have been posted for this race.

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.962
Other than that, we've tried
to reduce the rules to a minimum.

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:53.002
Instead of all this technical
namby-pamby there's so much of today,

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:57.442
we're putting the emphasis
on speed, endurance and courage,
the way it used to be.

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:03.643
As you know, this is
open formula racing. Anything goes.

01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.761
Any style of car
and crew you wish.

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:09.121
The object, gentlemen, is to win.
I wish you all the very best of luck.

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:17.763
Mr Wu? I understand that you are
the new owner of the Douglas car.

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:21.279
As I too am interested in the vehicle,
I took the liberty of looking you up.

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.560
- Thank you.
- You will therefore forgive me, sir,
when I say...

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.648
that you are perhaps
not quite as naive as you look.

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:29.648
In point of fact,
you are a very shrewd operator,

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:32.886
one who has managed to acquire,
by one means or another...

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.046
legitimate means, of course...

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.604
a number of varied enterprises.

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:40.721
It is truly written:
One cannot lose 'em all.

01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:43.523
In the light of this,
would you entertain a sizable wager...

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:45.606
on the outcome of the race?

01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:50.850
Wager? The goddess of fortune will
always find me her most ardent suitor.

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:54.565
Splendid. Splendid. Shall we step
in here? A little more private.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.966
You're Mr Thorndyke.
I've always wanted to meet you.

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:00.684
You've heard of me?
How charming!

01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:05.201
Are you not the gentleman who originated
the idea of small print...

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.844
on bottom of automobile
sales contract?

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.200
The very same.

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:14.323
- A most worthy adversary.
- You are most kind.

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.522
And now, sir,
the terms of our wager?

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:20.118
What would you like?

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:23.048
What have you got?

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:33.322
- Okay, let's mount up.
- How's our little friend?

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:35.406
- I hope it holds together.
- Holds together?

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:38.806
It was so beat up, I had to cut
the frame to straighten it out.

01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:42.961
Excuse me.

01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:47.648
Is this the morning bus to Fresno?

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.047
Thorndyke,
this little car goes so fast,

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:53.047
we need three people inside
to hold it on the ground.

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:56.162
Well, you certainly picked
the right crew. Toodle-oo.

01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:58.121
Break a leg, Thorndyke.

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:06.641
Havershaw. I trust you've not
been wasting your time.

01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:14.081
- Spent a few useful moments
with the small car?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:16.166
Based, then,
on what you now know,

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:19.600
what would you say are the chances
of victory for the Douglas car?

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:23.518
I would say that they range
from slight to impossible.

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:27.199
Havershaw, you are a rat
after my own heart.

01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.890
Thank you, sir.

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:32.399
Gentlemen, start your engines.

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:37.804
You're giving it a nice ride.

01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:50.362
Okay to uncurl my toes now?
We past everybody?

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:54.085
- Everyone but Thorndyke.
- Let's go to work.

01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:56.849
They're coming up on us, sir.

01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.926
Well, we're not
too concerned, are we?

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:05.680
Now, Havershaw,

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:09.644
aren't we coming to that rather
dangerous oily spot in the road?

01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:11.567
Coming right up, sir.

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:35.640
Come on! Push!
Push, you worm!

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.408
Jim, that's water!

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.880
Here we go!

01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:00.567
Mr Thorndyke,
that isn't me!

01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:06.527
Give me something
to wipe my goggles.

01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:14.403
Havershaw, you ever think
of having a manicure?

01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:18.163
There they are.

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:20.804
Now watch me
blow them off the road.

01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:27.401
Who's the guy
in the fur coat?

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:32.002
This is no time
for eating, you fool!

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:34.246
Where are we?
How far is Chinese Camp?

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:39.080
What's the matter with you?
Don't you even know how to open a map?

01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:16.404
At the moment, the leaders
of the race are approaching...

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.407
the historic mining towns
of the mother lode.

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:21.124
In first position,
as he moves past checkpoint three,

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.127
is Jim Douglas.

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:25.844
Peter Thorndyke in the Special
has regained his relief driver...

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:28.928
and is rapidly making up lost ground
as the two Pacemakers...

01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:31.928
near the famous old mining community
of Chinese Camp.

01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:38.640
- Now what?
- I don't know.
We can't be out of gas so soon.

01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:45.202
Here.
Wait a minute.

01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:48.561
- I got a suspicion.
- What's the matter?

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:52.444
Just as I thought. Water.
They did it again.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:02.128
- Now what do we do?
- Give me the map.

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:13.281
All right. It looks like Chinese Camp's
about three miles from here.

01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:16.208
- Now, if we come down the...
- Hey.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:22.680
What goes?

01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:25.449
No sweat, man.
This is Uncle Wu's car.

01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:28.164
You don't think he'd
let anyone put it down, do ya?

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:31.081
E- Easy, fellas.

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:37.364
The Jim Douglas car appears
to have run into trouble.

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:40.243
There has been no sign of him
past checkpoint nine.

01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:42.759
Peter Thorndyke is
refuelling at Chinese Camp.

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:58.367
Come on! Come on, will you!
I'm in a hurry!

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:01.368
Sure thing.
I tell Father.

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:07.848
My father say,

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:09.926
"Hurry is waste.

01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:13.122
Waste is cracked bowl
which never know rice. "

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:16.959
I don't care how cracked your father's
rice bowl is! What I want...

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:33.407
Hey! Some of you people
get over here right away!

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:35.486
Okay, you're on your way.

01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:39.285
I'm getting out of here.

01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:42.163
Not full. Can't go yet.

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:45.043
Well, just you watch me.

01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:59.490
As we come to the midway point
in the first day's racing,

01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:02.044
Peter Thorndyke,
after a delay at Chinese Camp,

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:04.479
is beginning to catch up
with the rest of the field.

01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:27.960
That knocked him off
the Christmas tree, sir.

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:39.724
This is our kind of terrain
from here on out. All downhill.

01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:31.649
How true it is that the best ways
are the simplest ways after all.

01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:34.568
- That's what I always say, sir...
- Oh, shut up!

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:57.924
We should be coming soon to what
is either a rail tunnel or a bridge.

01:19:58.050 --> 01:20:00.439
Oh, here's a tunnel.
That must be it.

01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:26.842
- What are you doin'?
- It's an elevator.

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.006
But Herbie doesn't fit.

01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:31.690
Everybody out.

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:36.526
No sign of them.

01:20:36.650 --> 01:20:39.403
You may open the wine now,
Havershaw.

01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:46.528
It's chilled the way
you like it, sir.

01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:49.847
All right, give me a hand.
All together now.

01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:56.808
To you, sir.
My unbounded admiration.

01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:59.364
Thank you.

01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:02.562
Mmm! You know something
about champagne, sir?

01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:06.319
Havershaw, if you tell me that
the bubbles tickle your nose,

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:08.805
I shall probably kill you!

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:23.604
Get rid of that slop!

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.921
Shouldn't that wheel
have come off by now?

01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:46.884
It's long overdue, sir.
I'm terribly embarrassed by the delay.

01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:50.400
- I don't know what could...
- Stop whimpering!

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:53.647
I'll just give them
a friendly nudge.

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:08.919
Hey, where'd
that wheel come from?

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.525
Hold it!

01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:33.081
Don't do anything sudden.

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.883
Is it all right
if I just cry real soft?

01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:39.161
Carole, put your feet
back here on the bumper.

01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:42.088
Come on.
Now give me your hand.

01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:45.088
Just let go. Let go.
Give me your hand.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.600
- I'm trying, but my mind
don't get the message.
- Come on. Come on.

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:53.563
Now come right over the top.

01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:56.521
Atta boy.

01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:02.046
All right. Let's get the spare wheel on
and get Herbie back on the road.

01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:10.119
Thorndyke again.
He made a pizza out of it.

01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:13.726
And now, here in Virginia City,

01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:16.080
the terminal point for
the first day of the El Dorado,

01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:18.485
we're all looking down
the road from the west.

01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:21.124
And actually at any moment now,
we should be seeing the car...

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:24.765
that will complete the first half of
the El Dorado, the run for the gold.

01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:28.200
Up in the judges stand
the judges and the timers are ready.

01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:32.528
- Just a moment. The first car
is coming in sight right now.

01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:35.642
He is really flying down the road.
And there he goes by us.

01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:45.284
You making it all right,
Tennessee?

01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:48.928
Ohh!

01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:51.803
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:55.002
Whoa!

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.927
Stop, Jim, will you!

01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:59.405
Now, don't anybody breathe.

01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:05.207
Ready?

01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:19.486
Aaah!

01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:41.564
Actually, at this hour
only one car is unaccounted for.

01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:44.124
There's been absolutely
no word of the Douglas Special,

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:47.879
which figured so very prominently
in the early stages of the race today.

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:52.561
Well, I see the judges are closing down
for the night, and, by golly, so are we.

01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:55.409
But we'll return to the El Dorado
at 7:30 tomorrow morning...

01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:59.239
to bring you the start of the second and
the final lap back to Yosemite Valley.

01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:01.167
Good night, everyone.

01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:25.683
A little bird's nest soup
never hurt anyone.

01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:27.448
Thank you.

01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:32.246
Oh, thanks.
I hope this holds together.

01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:34.361
I'm puttin' welds
on top of welds.

01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:51.079
Mr Wu, the wiring
is mostly all burned off.

01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:56.159
The cylinder walls are scored;
the carburettor's a mess;
the body's sprung.

01:25:56.290 --> 01:26:00.044
This little car ripped itself to pieces
trying to get us here.

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:02.286
It gave us everything it's got.

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:05.368
Now, maybe we can patch it
back together. I don't know.

01:26:05.490 --> 01:26:08.687
But how can I send it back
into that rat race tomorrow?

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:11.199
It's got nothing left to give.

01:26:16.770 --> 01:26:20.604
It's your car.
What do you say?

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:30.247
A wise man once said,

01:26:30.370 --> 01:26:32.930
"When you come to last page,

01:26:34.530 --> 01:26:36.486
close the book. "

01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:21.443
You let that little car
get under your skin, didn't you?

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.845
I don't know.

01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:29.600
There's a lot of gloop
been written about, uh,

01:27:29.730 --> 01:27:32.608
the bond between a man
and his automobile and...

01:27:34.330 --> 01:27:37.402
how he hates it sometimes,
mostly how he loves it.

01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:41.121
He showers gifts on it...

01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:45.289
in the way of accessories
and all that.

01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:49.847
He gets hysterical if somebody
scratches the paint or...

01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:54.088
makes it lose face
on the freeway.

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:57.919
Maybe some of those feelings
got into the machinery. I don't know.

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:02.563
Tennessee thinks so.

01:28:02.690 --> 01:28:04.965
Don't you?

01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:09.762
There is something real
about that little car,

01:28:11.410 --> 01:28:14.322
something that
doesn't even have a name.

01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:21.923
What I don't understand is, out of
the millions of people in the world,

01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:25.406
why it picked a dogeared
second-rater like me.

01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:32.681
You stood up for it once.

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:35.449
I guess it thought you were...

01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:38.084
worth belonging to.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.925
I understand that.

01:28:58.930 --> 01:29:03.720
Ah, Douglas.
Didn't mean to disturb you.

01:29:03.850 --> 01:29:06.239
- We'll just take the car and go.
- What are you talking about?

01:29:06.370 --> 01:29:08.645
I understand that you
are out of the race.

01:29:08.770 --> 01:29:11.045
What does that have
to do with you?

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:13.730
Speaking as the new owner
of the car,

01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:16.284
I'd regard your question
as impertinent.

01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:19.846
- I'm going to hoist it up
and drag it out.
- Hold it!

01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:22.723
Who said you were
the new owner of the car?

01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:25.410
Perhaps Mr Wu would like to explain
how he wagered the car...

01:29:25.530 --> 01:29:28.044
on the outcome of the race.

01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:33.198
Even as you, I believed in the car;
I thought it would win.

01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:36.646
More honestly,

01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:40.046
I could not resist the odds.

01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:43.765
Thank you.

01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:47.803
Good sir, would you say
that this is a compact car?

01:29:49.730 --> 01:29:51.686
You do not answer.

01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:54.563
Well, let me tell you that
you have never seen a compact car...

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.079
until you see what
I'm going to do with this.

01:29:57.210 --> 01:30:00.520
Mr Douglas, I have a friend
with a claw-and-hook...

01:30:00.650 --> 01:30:03.528
auto wrecking company
in San Francisco,

01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:06.118
and he's going to work
on your car.

01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:08.480
Maybe he'll transform it
into a birdbath.

01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:12.842
Or what about a nice doormat
so I can wipe my feet on it every day?

01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:16.007
It's too bad this thing
doesn't have the gumption...

01:30:16.130 --> 01:30:18.439
to get up to the starting line
this morning.

01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.800
I should have enjoyed beating it.

01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:23.364
- Ohh!
- Why, you!

01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:25.720
Take your hand...
Get your hand off...

01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:52.362
Stop! Herbie, stop!

01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:55.368
Hey, you know something?

01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:57.446
Small car very angry.

01:30:57.570 --> 01:31:00.038
And very strong.

01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:02.365
The strength of 40 horses.

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:05.527
What do you think
about that race coming up?

01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:08.005
You know, I think now...

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:12.328
is chance to remove
egg foo yung off of face.

01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:15.567
Well, this morning, the second
and the final lap of the El Dorado.

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:19.285
From Virginia City to Yosemite,
the run for the gold.

01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:21.844
Out there we see in first position
and all ready to go...

01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:25.679
Peter Thorndyke
in his Thorndyke Special.

01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:37.768
Hey!

01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:40.927
These mechanics have done a real
fine job in keying these engines up.

01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:43.769
Come on, baby. Come on.
Save it for the race.

01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:46.324
One more foul-up like this,
Douglas, you're disqualified.

01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:50.085
It seemed to be trying
to get at us, sir.

01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:53.600
Of course it was, Havershaw!
There's no use trying to blink the fact.

01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:55.721
It's either us or it this time.

01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:05.249
We're now getting reports
from our checkpoint number 14.

01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:07.679
This one tells us
that the Thorndyke car...

01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:10.483
is still holding first position
at this time.

01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:12.646
And while here
in Virginia City,

01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:15.284
we're preparing to dispatch
the last of our contestants.

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:17.287
That would be
the Jim Douglas Special.

01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:20.880
Hang tight.
This may be a fast takeoff.

01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:26.049
Now.

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:05.966
- Good stuff, Herb.
- No more shortcuts like that last one.

01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:08.479
Oh, this won't be anything
like that last one.

01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:32.165
Thorndyke.

01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:34.679
Nice going, Herbie.
We've almost got him.

01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:37.040
Hooray.

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:48.129
- What fool laid out these streets?
- But you're driving superbly.

01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:53.279
Hey, you got something
against driving on the streets?

01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:59.928
- Any sign of them?
- Not a glimmer, sir.

01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:07.802
Very well, then. Now I've
finished being Generous George.

01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:23.526
He's moving up.

01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:35.086
There are times like this...

01:34:35.210 --> 01:34:37.963
when I really don't like
myself very much.

01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:42.126
What happened to it?

01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:45.925
I'd say it's gone for that
last big lube job up yonder.

01:34:50.530 --> 01:34:52.327
Ohh! Ohh!

01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:55.283
Ohh!

01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:22.166
Here it comes again, sir.

01:35:22.290 --> 01:35:24.645
Havershaw, I am not
a cowardly man,

01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:28.001
but I am beginning to sense
that that thing is out to get me.

01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:31.088
Now, now. None of that, sir.
We're not losing our nerve, are we?

01:35:31.210 --> 01:35:33.770
Blast you, Havershaw!
How dare you patronize me.

01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:35.881
I am not losing my nerve!

01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:38.365
No, sir. No, sir.
Of course not, sir. No, no.

01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:51.965
I think Herbie did something
to himself that last fall.

01:35:52.090 --> 01:35:54.046
What do you mean?

01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:57.924
Well... like maybe
he won't hang together much longer.

01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:15.970
- What happened to Thorndyke?
- I don't know.

01:36:16.090 --> 01:36:18.365
It was like he disappeared.

01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:23.800
- Do you hear something?
- It sounds like one of the cylinders.

01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:26.603
That's impossible.
The cylinders are in the back.

01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:28.925
That's a point
I find puzzling.

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.163
Get me out of here!

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:38.126
- Oh, my...
- Get that side!

01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:40.810
Goodness. Oh.

01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:45.207
Here.
Turn him around.

01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:47.685
Okay, on your way.

01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:51.526
Let's go!

01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:58.765
Havershaw!

01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:03.084
The leaders have now passed
the final checkpoint.

01:37:03.210 --> 01:37:06.600
We're now moving outside,
and we should be seeing them
at the finish line in a few minutes.

01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:11.201
The word is,
the Douglas car is in the lead,
but the Thorndyke car is moving up.

01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:27.200
Uh-oh.

01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:30.561
I think we got a problem.

01:37:30.690 --> 01:37:32.965
Carole, turn around.

01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:37.682
Grab hold of that strap
and pull.

01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:54.043
You okay?

01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:56.479
Fine... Look!

01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:58.362
There's another one.

01:37:58.490 --> 01:38:00.481
I got it!

01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:04.963
- What goes on?
- Just keep drivin'!

01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:08.162
Try not to think about
what I'm doing!

01:38:11.210 --> 01:38:13.929
Well, that's that. What's... Aah!

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:18.285
I can't weld that!

01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:21.606
Give me your hand!

01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:25.880
What are we gonna do, jump?

01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:28.604
- No! Pull!
- Pull?

01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:30.721
Whoa!

01:38:30.850 --> 01:38:35.082
Whoa! Jim! Help!

01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:39.522
I think you better stop
before someone gets hurt.

01:38:40.930 --> 01:38:43.046
No dice.
Herbie doesn't want to stop.

01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:50.807
There it is.

01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:53.922
I'll bomb the thing off the road
once and for all!

01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:15.289
Rotten sportsmanship,
if you ask me.

01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:18.925
Here at the finish, we're still waiting
for our first glimpse of the leaders.

01:39:23.050 --> 01:39:25.041
Yes. Yes,
there they are!

01:39:25.170 --> 01:39:28.207
The Thorndyke car now seems to have
a slight edge on the Douglas car,

01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:30.446
which is hanging right in there.

01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:32.925
You have him now, sir.
Don't falter.

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:35.928
I'm not going to falter,
you dimwit.

01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:54.525
Good-o, sir. Good-o.
You can't lose.

01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:56.959
You can't possibly lo...

01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:21.241
W- We won!
We won!

01:40:21.370 --> 01:40:23.201
Oh!

01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:27.482
The little car takes first...
and third place.

01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:29.407
Aaah!

01:40:59.330 --> 01:41:02.447
Do what? Kiss?
You better believe it. Come here.

01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:22.367
"Couldn't lose,"
I think you said.

01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:25.607
I don't like to remind you, sir,
but if only you'd read the terms...

01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:27.846
of that stupid wager
you made with Mr Wu...

01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:30.723
Havershaw, you're despicable.

01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:40.288
Havershaw, I shan't pretend
that I don't know what you're thinking.

01:41:40.410 --> 01:41:44.369
However, I pride myself
on being a good judge of character.

01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:49.689
And when I ask myself,
"Could this man be capable
of such an act of pettiness and...

01:41:51.450 --> 01:41:53.759
base ingratitude... "

01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:56.165
I accept that as your answer.

01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:07.728
- Thanks, Herbie. So long, Mr Wu.
- Goodbye.

01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:09.647
- Goodbye, Mr Wu.
- Bye, Tennessee.

01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:11.920
So long, Jim.

01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:15.042
It's none of my business, but where
are you going on your honeymoon?

01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:17.923
We don't know.
Herb hasn't told us yet.

01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:20.484
Let's go, Herb.

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.486
Goodbye, Herbie.
