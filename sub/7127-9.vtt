00:01.134 --> 00:02.965
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:03.036 --> 00:04.663
I've been seeing things.

00:04.738 --> 00:05.705
When do you take it out?

00:05.805 --> 00:08.740
Given the location of the aneurysm,
surgery is a bad idea.

00:08.808 --> 00:09.900
- Who's that?
- Beth.

00:09.976 --> 00:12.945
The Beth that was
your first at-bat? Wow.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.378
- I feel awful.
- And you broke up with me.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.712
- Want a drink?
- Stone's out. Dowd's in.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.217
- You're firing me?
- I can't.

00:19.285 --> 00:22.652
I'm not obligated to provide
you with an office or assistant.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.781
It's been my aneurysm
the whole time

00:24.858 --> 00:27.156
and I'm going to get
this thing out of my head.

00:27.227 --> 00:30.492
- Surgery could kill you!
- Won't have anything left to live for.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.099
There's got to be
a less humiliating outfit.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.397
Something that closes in the back.

00:36.469 --> 00:39.097
I heard one of the nurses say
your butt was cute.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.000
Don't be nervous.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.373
We're talking about surgery on my brain.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.439
What's there to be nervous about?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.208
- Blindness.
- Coma.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.977
Long-term memory loss.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.885
Sure. I can remove it.
It's no biggie. You've found your man.

00:54.954 --> 00:58.651
- Really? That's fantastic.
- Told you.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.559
Just out of curiosity, how attached
are you to your ability to speak?

01:02.629 --> 01:06.895
- So I'd be a vegetable.
- No one used the word vegetable.

01:06.966 --> 01:11.596
I was combining blindness, paralysis,
and brain damage into one category.

01:11.671 --> 01:14.765
Didn't you mention some
hospital in China? Tin-tin Puma?

01:14.874 --> 01:18.139
Tiantan Puhua. The news won't sound
any better in Mandarin.

01:18.211 --> 01:21.180
Look, Eli, are you sure this
is something you really want?

01:21.281 --> 01:24.114
If the something is ending up
a drooling idiot, then no.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.152
If it means getting the defect removed

01:26.219 --> 01:28.551
that's making my life a living hell,
then yes.

01:28.621 --> 01:31.749
Good news is you're already an idiot,
the only thing left to do

01:31.825 --> 01:34.191
- is pick a surgeon for the other.
- Out of those?

01:34.294 --> 01:36.194
They couldn't remove a cap from a pen.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.822
They're the best neurosurgeons
I could get you.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.957
Let's try the ones you couldn't get.

01:41.034 --> 01:45.733
All right there's one. Sanjay Rajapaksa,
but he doesn't take walk-ins.

01:45.805 --> 01:48.467
He only handles cases
from his own hospital.

01:48.541 --> 01:51.203
He did until you applied
your powers of persuasion.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.040
All right. I'll make a call.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.636
You're the best. Thank you.

01:54.714 --> 01:58.411
Don't thank me. I don't want to spend
my life wiping drool off your chin.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.584
Nurse Ramirez to Critical
Care. Nurse Ramirez to Critical Care.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.786
- Beth?
- Eli!

02:08.862 --> 02:09.829
Hi.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.397
Hi. What are you doing at the hospital?

02:12.465 --> 02:16.231
I, um... I'm sorry I just
didn't expect to see you.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.306
Ben. I'm bringing Ben to the doctor.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.797
You know he's not with you?

02:22.876 --> 02:26.004
Yes, he's at the psychologist.

02:26.079 --> 02:29.139
They work one-on-one for an hour.
Individual counseling.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.848
So how are you? I saw you on the news.

02:31.918 --> 02:35.410
I was going to call, but I figured
you have enough on your plate.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.252
Yeah, I've been better. I...

02:38.358 --> 02:41.088
I got demoted and I lost my office.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.858
I had a fight with my
acupuncturist/spiritual guide.

02:44.931 --> 02:47.991
I alienated the one person at work
who mistakenly admired me

02:48.067 --> 02:50.160
and I made a serious ethical breach

02:50.236 --> 02:53.797
which helped get several hundred people
kicked out of their homes.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.431
And I broke up with Taylor.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.375
Oh, wow. That's...

02:59.445 --> 03:04.382
Oh, Eli, if you ever need to talk,
you still have my number, right?

03:05.518 --> 03:08.783
Yeah. I just might give you a call.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.291
OK. Bye.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.534
You'll never guess who I ran into.
Patti, guess.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.173
- You're not Patti.
- No. I'm Bradley Kitsis.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.337
I'm your temp.

03:33.413 --> 03:34.971
- Where's Patti?
- Not here.

03:35.081 --> 03:38.312
I noticed. I can see, Bradley.
At least for now.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.614
She left me this note to read to you.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.178
- "I'm taking a personal week. "
- Personal week?

03:43.256 --> 03:46.123
"To look after my relatives
in Silver Terrace,

03:46.192 --> 03:49.923
who, thanks to you, now have no homes!"

03:50.964 --> 03:53.660
"No homes" is in capital letters,
which is why I...

03:53.733 --> 03:56.099
Thanks, Brad. I got it.

03:56.202 --> 03:58.932
Our billables are up
by ten percent this quarter.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.771
An increase almost entirely due
to our success in the Solinsky case.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.936
I can't help but swell
with fatherly pride.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.575
I had a lot of help.

04:08.648 --> 04:12.379
Perhaps you'd be willing to apply
your deft touch to Judge Doyle.

04:12.452 --> 04:15.615
This being "Doyle the Boil. " Good luck.

04:15.688 --> 04:20.557
Judge Doyle has just retained WPK
in connection with a medical crisis.

04:20.627 --> 04:24.927
Is he getting the pole removed from
his rectum? I hear that can be painful.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.558
Not nearly as painful as leukemia,
Mr. Dowd.

04:29.035 --> 04:32.402
Judge Doyle needs a bone marrow
transplant to treat his cancer,

04:32.472 --> 04:36.203
his only donor match backed out
of the donation agreement yesterday.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.643
Now that we've established
your sensitivity to the plight,

04:39.712 --> 04:41.407
you can assist Taylor.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.217
Sir, Doyle the...
Judge Doyle hates me.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.221
I'm sure you're familiar
with my "I could care less" face.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.189
Moving on...

05:39.038 --> 05:42.474
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. George Michael.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.272
Oh, no, it's not.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.778
Oh, no, it's not what?

05:47.447 --> 05:50.211
Are you Eli Stone?
I'm George Michael.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.246
Would you mind not poking me, please?

05:57.323 --> 06:01.054
I'm sorry. It's just, you know,
you're very solid for a vision.

06:01.127 --> 06:04.153
- You're an odd man.
- At least I'm not a hallucination.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.130
Well, he can see me.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.962
Do you see me talking to anyone?

06:08.067 --> 06:10.297
A real life, actual person?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.066
Of course I do, sir. That's Bono.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.802
Yeah, happens all the time.
I had the glasses first, by the way.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.436
Mind you Bono and I
do have something in common,

06:19.512 --> 06:22.242
in that we are both perfectly visible.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.545
I'm sorry I've been wasting your time.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.244
No, no, no, please, please.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.879
Stay. I... I'm sorry.
I just don't...

06:28.988 --> 06:31.548
I don't typically
get visits like this one.

06:31.657 --> 06:33.147
Um...

06:34.160 --> 06:36.924
- What can I do for you, Mr. Michael?
- Call me George.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.623
I want you take a case for me.

06:38.698 --> 06:42.600
I found this in the Times. It's about
a young girl thrown out of school

06:42.668 --> 06:46.832
for playing one of my songs
at a school "abstinence assembly. "

06:46.939 --> 06:49.908
This was all over the news.
What was the song again?

06:50.009 --> 06:51.169
I Want Your Sex.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.940
Sorry, you're not my type.
That was a joke.

06:54.013 --> 06:57.107
Anyway, I want to hire you
to help her get back in.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.549
I'll cover all the legal fees,
Mr. Stone.

06:59.619 --> 07:02.144
Call me Eli.
And this is very generous of you.

07:02.221 --> 07:06.521
Obviously, I wouldn't, well...
I couldn't say no to you.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.460
- So if you don't mind me asking...
- Mm-hm.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.998
Why me?
Why did you come to me?

07:13.065 --> 07:16.592
Well, you might think
I'm the odd one now.

07:16.669 --> 07:20.127
But the other night I had a dream and...

07:20.206 --> 07:22.367
...in the dream I was completely lost,

07:22.442 --> 07:26.401
when someone told me
I needed to find a lawyer

07:26.512 --> 07:29.640
named Eli Stone.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.496
Mr. Wethersby?

07:46.265 --> 07:48.495
You were looking for me, sir?

07:48.568 --> 07:52.595
That would be inconsistent with
the termination of our relationship.

07:52.672 --> 07:55.903
I heard you wanted to see me.
Maybe Bradley meant Mr. Posner.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.237
No, he meant me.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.438
I didn't want you inferring
that I craved this conversation.

08:01.681 --> 08:05.447
Nevertheless, I understand that you've
been retained by... Who was it again?

08:05.551 --> 08:08.179
George Michael? The pop superstar?

08:08.254 --> 08:10.279
Yes, sir. Unless there's a problem?

08:10.356 --> 08:13.917
There is. Two problems, in fact.
One, you're still on probation.

08:14.026 --> 08:17.553
Secondly, section 6.3, paragraph J
of the partnership agreement

08:17.630 --> 08:20.599
obligates a partner to oversee any case

08:20.666 --> 08:22.691
where the client has a high profile.

08:22.768 --> 08:26.431
I guess it's good then that
George isn't technically the client.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.634
Her name is Molly Foster. She's 17

08:29.709 --> 08:31.074
and much less famous.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.168
I don't have time to waste
on semantics.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.306
If someone of Mr. Michael's esteem
is involved in this case,

08:36.381 --> 08:39.145
then obviously the requirement
to oversee applies.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.520
Including appearing in court?

08:43.556 --> 08:45.717
And managing client relations, yes.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.355
OK, then, welcome to the case.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.886
Mr. Michael will appreciate
having a senior partner on his team.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.024
- As will Molly, sir.
- Who?

08:55.101 --> 08:57.365
Our client, Molly Foster.

08:58.571 --> 09:02.234
Right. Right.

09:03.509 --> 09:06.410
I didn't expect this
from Jordan Wethersby.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.846
I ask him to send me his best lawyers,
he sends me a girl.

09:09.949 --> 09:14.079
Well, let me introduce you
to Mr. Wethersby's daughter, sir.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.316
I wasn't talking about her, Dowd.

09:18.024 --> 09:22.154
Good to see you, Taylor.
So let's get to it.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.254
So you're worried about
the lack of legal precedent?

09:25.331 --> 09:28.596
No, I'm worried about
the lack of precedent in our favor.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.397
That's why I pay you $550 an hour.

09:30.469 --> 09:34.701
I know this is a long shot,
but I have no choice. I'm dying.

09:37.076 --> 09:41.945
Leukemia progressed to stage four.
Nowhere to go but down.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.574
- Did you tell the would-be donor?
- No, Mr. Dowd.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.619
I want him to think I need
the extractions of his marrow

09:47.687 --> 09:49.245
for my personal collection.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.621
Usually, only family members
are an exact match.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.355
- The would-be donor is a relative?
- My son.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.590
He knows you're dying
and won't help you?

09:58.698 --> 10:00.131
We aren't exactly close.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.565
He was two when
his mother and I divorced.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.762
And I haven't seen Scott since then.

10:05.838 --> 10:09.274
So the settlement conference
we're scheduled to have in an hour

10:09.342 --> 10:12.106
is the first time you're
seeing your son in 19 years?

10:13.012 --> 10:14.104
Yep.

10:14.180 --> 10:18.640
OK, I'll have all the sharp objects
removed from the conference room.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.017
This is critical. It's important
that you let me do the talking,

10:23.089 --> 10:25.649
- get us on the right foot with Mary.
- Molly, sir...

10:25.725 --> 10:28.421
She'll be reluctant to dive
into the legal waters...

10:28.494 --> 10:30.257
- Eli.
- George, hello again.

10:30.329 --> 10:33.059
Sorry, I'm not too late, am I?
You're off to see Molly?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.100
- No, you're just in time.
- Cool.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.931
This is the firm's senior partner,
Jordan Wethersby.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.767
He's gonna get us on the right foot.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.237
Good to meet you.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.002
Yes, it's an...

10:44.010 --> 10:46.501
It's an honor, Mr. Michael.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.742
- Yeah, call me George.
- George.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.651
It's good to see you again.

10:57.757 --> 11:01.693
You make it sound like
we just saw each other last week.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.326
Why don't we all sit down?

11:07.700 --> 11:10.863
Have you had a chance
to review our proposal?

11:10.970 --> 11:14.030
Yes. Scott?

11:14.106 --> 11:18.440
This isn't...
I don't care about the money.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.538
Well, Judge Doyle already prevailed
upon your more noble instincts.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.583
I took the test.

11:24.650 --> 11:27.278
Doctors started to describe
the procedure to me,

11:27.353 --> 11:30.322
and I guess I had second thoughts, OK?

11:31.657 --> 11:34.524
I'm sorry, it's not like
I even know you or anything.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.151
I know. I know. And I'm sorry,

11:36.262 --> 11:38.958
I truly am.
But I'm asking for your help here.

11:39.031 --> 11:43.331
And believe me when I tell you that's
not something that comes easy for me.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.368
I went through this phase where I'd send
you things, letters, report cards.

11:49.475 --> 11:52.308
What did you ever do
with those things anyway?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.945
I thought...

11:55.014 --> 11:58.575
I thought I shouldn't promise
a relationship I couldn't deliver on.

12:01.153 --> 12:05.112
Yeah. Yeah, well...

12:05.224 --> 12:07.192
...I guess I can't deliver now.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.022
Sorry.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.828
I don't think we'll be settling.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.639
You are a dead ringer. It's amazing.

12:20.706 --> 12:24.836
Mom! You have to see this
George Michael impersonator Chloe hired!

12:24.910 --> 12:27.936
- It's hilarious.
- Hi, Molly. Great to meet you.

12:28.013 --> 12:31.471
I've read about your expulsion,
and I've hired these attorneys

12:31.550 --> 12:33.575
- to help get you back in.
- Shut up.

12:35.221 --> 12:39.089
No way! Please come in.
Can I get you gentlemen anything?

12:39.158 --> 12:42.218
Coffee? Something British?
Crumpets or a pint of bitters?

12:42.294 --> 12:43.454
No, thank you.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.191
Sir, you're unusually quiet.
Are you feeling OK?

12:46.265 --> 12:48.825
I feel fine. Don't ever touch me again.

12:50.569 --> 12:54.096
- So you totally read about me?
- Yeah.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.663
That is so cool.

12:55.741 --> 12:58.266
Tell us exactly what happened at school.

12:58.344 --> 13:02.110
- There was this lame-ass assembly.
- The abstinence-only assembly.

13:02.214 --> 13:06.947
Twice a semester, some expert in never
ever having sex tells us all about it.

13:07.019 --> 13:11.752
After two years of this... bull,
I decided to take a stand.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.883
I snuck into the principal's office

13:13.959 --> 13:16.519
and played I Want Your Sex
over the PA.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.928
The challenge is circumventing
the Supreme Court's decision in

13:19.999 --> 13:23.298
Morse v. Frederick, which limits
free speech on school grounds.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.803
So you're saying I could lose?

13:25.871 --> 13:28.431
Always a possibility in litigation,
Ms. Foster,

13:28.507 --> 13:31.999
but you gotta have faith.

13:32.077 --> 13:35.444
- Another one of your songs, I think.
- Oh, that's right. Yeah.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.239
Excuse me.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.613
Hey, it's me.
I just got off the phone with Rajapaksa.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.849
You remember? The super neurosurgeon?

13:44.924 --> 13:49.088
Well, it took a lot of begging
and a new set of golf clubs,

13:49.195 --> 13:52.460
but he's agreed to see you.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.972
It's a risk either way you slice it.

14:03.075 --> 14:07.136
Actually, there won't be any slicing
involved. We'll burn it out of you.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.375
That's just what I always wanted.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.274
So you guys will talk and let me know?

14:12.351 --> 14:15.047
Yeah, we'll call you later.
Thank you so much.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.644
Anytime.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.652
Awesome.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.264
OK, there's an OR free week after next
with your name on it.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.832
You sure that's the guy?

14:27.900 --> 14:31.233
He's competent, confident,
expert in the latest techniques.

14:31.303 --> 14:34.067
If he were any more qualified,
he'd be a TV character.

14:34.139 --> 14:37.506
I'm not asking for a description.
I'm asking if that's the guy.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.571
I can't make that choice for you, Eli.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.616
It's too big.

14:45.351 --> 14:48.252
You're the only one who can do that.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.982
- You want this thing out or not?
- I want it out.

14:51.056 --> 14:54.685
I just... I'm not sure that
this is the right time.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.193
I'm having a strange week.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.991
From you, that's something.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.555
George Michael showed up in my office,
for real this time.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.569
Don't joke. The same day
I happened to bump into Beth,

15:04.637 --> 15:06.764
and she has a connection with him.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.171
- Beth? Beth Keller?
- Yeah.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.005
Her son sees a doctor at this hospital.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.272
I was thinking of giving her a call.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.780
- Wait, a call like...
- Like a date, yes.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.373
- Yeah.
- Why not?

15:18.450 --> 15:22.011
I'm newly single,
about to be aneurysm-free.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.954
- Well, yeah. But...
- But what?

15:25.024 --> 15:29.393
Nothing. Just, you know...
be careful, all right?

15:30.529 --> 15:34.488
I mean, I know I'm not the reason
my parents split and my father left,

15:34.600 --> 15:38.036
but when you're a kid, that's how
it feels, like it's your fault.

15:38.570 --> 15:42.666
But now you have a chance
at reconciling with your father.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.436
If I give him my bone marrow.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.236
What kind of relationship do we
have with those strings attached?

15:52.584 --> 15:55.314
How do you know whether
you're a compatible donor?

15:55.387 --> 15:58.948
I got tested.
Three months ago he called me up.

15:59.024 --> 16:02.585
No "how are you?"
No "sorry I wrote you off. "

16:02.661 --> 16:05.528
Just "I've got cancer,
would you get your blood tested?"

16:05.597 --> 16:08.760
The test determined that you
are indeed a compatible donor.

16:08.867 --> 16:12.428
Yes. I'm a match. Hoping the family
similarities end there.

16:12.504 --> 16:14.938
Why go through having yourself tested

16:15.007 --> 16:17.874
if you're not prepared
to go through with donation?

16:17.943 --> 16:21.003
Is it because maybe you have
an obligation to your father,

16:21.080 --> 16:22.945
however estranged he may be?

16:24.750 --> 16:26.877
I got tested because...

16:28.988 --> 16:32.754
I wanted to see
if I was a match.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.291
I wanted to see if
I could save your life.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.264
So I could tell
you to go choke on it.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.469
My reasons were just.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.768
I knew I'd get in trouble.
I just didn't think I'd be expelled.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.332
Did you not know
school policy gives the principal

16:51.410 --> 16:54.846
discretion to expel
anyone whose behavior...

16:54.913 --> 16:56.608
..."interferes with the learning

16:56.682 --> 16:59.845
of other students or
disrupts the education process. "

16:59.918 --> 17:04.685
Yes, but that assumes what was
happening at the assembly was learning.

17:04.757 --> 17:08.318
The abstinence-only lady tells us
condoms don't work,

17:08.394 --> 17:11.157
that girls who have
abortions are prone to suicide.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.131
And because of all
of those misconceptions,

17:14.199 --> 17:18.329
students in abstinence-only programs
are less likely to use contraception.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.237
Objection. Are we to accept
her as an expert witness?

17:21.306 --> 17:24.332
The plaintiff's knowledge
or, I submit, lack thereof

17:24.410 --> 17:26.742
goes to the merits, or lack thereof,

17:26.811 --> 17:30.111
of the pedagogy Ms. Foster's
protest was taking issue with.

17:30.182 --> 17:33.845
Ms. Foster, please limit
your answers to your direct experiences.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.180
Molly, how has
the school's policy affected you?

17:38.257 --> 17:41.226
First, my lab partner got pregnant.

17:41.326 --> 17:42.691
Then...

17:42.795 --> 17:46.697
...a friend. I don't want to tell her
name 'cause her mom would kill her.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.325
She got gonorrhea in her throat.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.401
I decided I had to do something.

17:52.471 --> 17:57.340
Thank you, Molly. Very descriptive.

17:59.378 --> 18:03.109
And the something you decided
to do was to play the song

18:03.182 --> 18:05.309
I Want Your Sex at a school assembly?

18:05.384 --> 18:08.046
That's a mature form
of political protest.

18:08.120 --> 18:12.352
The execution of Ms. Foster's protest
isn't at issue here,

18:12.424 --> 18:16.918
only whether it's protected under
our country's constitutional principles.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.759
- Is that an objection?
- A strenuous one, Your Honor.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.230
Sustained.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.825
There was no other course of action?

18:24.903 --> 18:28.430
You couldn't have organized a petition?

18:28.507 --> 18:31.874
I wanted to expose the hypocrisy.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.741
And when you did, do you think
you were being disruptive?

18:35.781 --> 18:38.215
- I hope so.
- Thank you.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.944
No further questions.

18:40.018 --> 18:43.454
That was invigorating.
It reminded me of my salad days,

18:43.522 --> 18:45.854
standing up,
making a compelling objection.

18:45.924 --> 18:49.189
- In the middle of my examination.
- On an issue of significance.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.389
Not just freedom of speech,
but the application of that right

18:52.464 --> 18:55.399
to our nation's youngest,
ones who are disenfranchised,

18:55.467 --> 18:57.162
not having the right to vote...

18:58.504 --> 19:00.267
Something on your mind, Mr. Stone?

19:00.372 --> 19:04.001
I was just wondering
if it was possible that you were

19:04.076 --> 19:07.409
a fanboy of a certain celebrity client?

19:07.479 --> 19:11.973
Mr. Stone, did you just characterize me,
Jordan Wethersby the Second,

19:12.050 --> 19:17.352
senior partner of one of this country's
most prestigious firms, a fanboy?

19:17.923 --> 19:21.086
- Of course not, sir, but...
- I didn't think so.

19:21.193 --> 19:24.754
And for the record, my musical tastes
are none of your concern.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.877
In the name of all
that's good and holy, what now?

20:16.081 --> 20:17.514
I Got You Babe?

20:17.583 --> 20:20.950
I hate that song and I would never sing
it under any circumstances,

20:21.019 --> 20:22.384
even hallucinatory ones.

20:22.487 --> 20:25.945
Just like you would never go out
with one of our co-workers.

20:26.024 --> 20:27.753
Something you want to ask me?

20:27.826 --> 20:31.318
No. Because I don't listen
to my visions anymore, so...

20:31.396 --> 20:32.829
Considering last week,

20:32.898 --> 20:36.459
a. k.a. Bribing a judge,
that's probably for the best.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.002
Without admitting or denying anything,

20:39.071 --> 20:42.097
there won't be any more of that.
I'm having it taken out.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.766
The aneurysm.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.504
I thought it was too dangerous.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.842
The ability to swallow is overrated.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.382
Is there something going on
with you and Matt?

20:51.450 --> 20:54.942
No. You know, if you hadn't
dumped me repeatedly, I might add,

20:55.020 --> 20:57.716
- I would say you were jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.620
It's just been a rough week. OK?

20:59.691 --> 21:02.421
You wouldn't happen
to have any time later?

21:02.494 --> 21:03.859
I'll tell you all about it.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.758
Look, I get the feeling
you're alone right now.

21:08.867 --> 21:13.236
So am I. But I'm trying to move on.

21:13.305 --> 21:17.605
So I can't be that shoulder
for you to cry on.

21:17.676 --> 21:19.109
I'm sorry. I just... I can't.

21:19.845 --> 21:20.971
It's OK.

21:28.553 --> 21:31.852
Hey, Beth. It's Eli.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.426
I was thinking about
what you said the other day,

21:37.496 --> 21:40.624
about needing to talk to someone,

21:40.699 --> 21:43.463
and I kind of do.

21:46.938 --> 21:49.805
Principal Ackerman,
you said that Molly was expelled

21:49.875 --> 21:53.402
because her actions were
a violation of school policy, correct?

21:53.478 --> 21:56.970
Students have to learn about
consequences. That's why the school

21:57.049 --> 22:00.416
has a strict zero-tolerance policy
in those circumstances.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.648
Zero tolerance? So, you expel
every kid who pulls a prank.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.814
When those pranks are disruptive.

22:05.891 --> 22:09.054
So last fall, when the
football team kidnapped the mascot

22:09.161 --> 22:11.322
from a rival school,
did you expel the team?

22:11.430 --> 22:14.593
I didn't deem that prank disruptive
to students' educations.

22:14.700 --> 22:18.261
What about when the senior class
glued the teacher's lounge door shut?

22:18.370 --> 22:20.930
- Those students were suspended.
- Not expelled.

22:21.039 --> 22:25.806
Sounds like your zero-tolerance policy
is more like a six-tolerance policy.

22:25.911 --> 22:29.574
- Objection.
- Pass the witness.

22:31.516 --> 22:36.385
Principal Ackerman, why does your
school have an abstinence-only program?

22:36.455 --> 22:40.414
It's the only sex education that
the government will give us money for.

22:40.525 --> 22:43.858
If word got out that a student played
a sexually-explicit song

22:43.929 --> 22:45.658
during one of your assemblies...

22:45.731 --> 22:48.894
I'd lose funding and the
school would have no sex-ed program.

22:48.967 --> 22:50.457
Is that right? I don't know.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.971
What I do know is that playing
a song that promotes promiscuous sex

22:54.039 --> 22:57.406
during a lecture on abstinence
risks the program for everyone.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.340
The plaintiff would like
to call a rebuttal witness.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.713
Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou.

23:05.784 --> 23:10.414
It's the legal name of the artist who
wrote the offending song, Your Honor.

23:10.489 --> 23:11.922
Mr. George Michael.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.458
Fine. Court will recess until tomorrow.

23:14.526 --> 23:17.359
You're a judge.
The case comes before you,

23:17.429 --> 23:21.957
do you order one human being to undergo
a painful procedure to benefit another?

23:22.033 --> 23:25.400
Bottom line, if I were a jurist on this,

23:25.470 --> 23:27.995
I could find precedent
to support saving my life.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.440
My son can be as angry as he
wants at me, but last time I checked,

23:31.510 --> 23:34.673
being a lousy dad
didn't carry the death penalty.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.879
You know, I had a dad.

23:44.956 --> 23:49.620
He left my mother when I was six,
for her best friend.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.297
I saw him summers
and every other Christmas...

23:54.366 --> 23:57.460
I'm sorry, at what point did
Mr. Dowd become a witness?

23:57.536 --> 23:59.299
At the point when you let me finish.

24:00.572 --> 24:03.598
My dad died three years ago.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.408
And if I had a chance to save his life,

24:06.478 --> 24:09.936
I think the first thing I'd want
to know is why I should.

24:10.015 --> 24:13.109
Because regret's
a lousy thing to live with.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.313
That's sweet. They should put
that in a poem or something.

24:16.388 --> 24:21.917
We're all here wondering why
Scott should feel any regret at all.

24:21.993 --> 24:25.759
You're as much a stranger to him
as my father was to me. More so.

24:25.831 --> 24:30.598
We're family. However estranged
we may be, nothing changes that.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.330
No, you changed it.

24:32.404 --> 24:37.103
You walked out that door two decades
ago, and you never looked back!

24:37.175 --> 24:38.506
So I should die for that?

24:38.577 --> 24:40.909
Scott didn't give you cancer, judge.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.742
- You want him to save you?
- Yes.

24:42.814 --> 24:47.581
Tell us. Tell us why he should.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.678
Because he's my son.
He has an obligation...

24:50.755 --> 24:54.623
No, he doesn't. You pissed
away any obligation he had to you.

24:54.693 --> 24:57.321
Now tell us why he should help you now.

24:57.395 --> 24:59.420
Because I want to live.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.295
I want to live.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.476
And the only chance
I have of that is him.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.073
Beth?

25:18.149 --> 25:20.913
- Taylor. We met at...
- Your engagement party.

25:20.986 --> 25:22.817
Of course. It's so nice to see you.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.051
What are you doing here?
Is everything OK? Your son?

25:26.124 --> 25:29.059
Oh, he's great, thanks.
No, I'm not here on business.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.220
I'm having dinner.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.856
- With Eli?
- Yeah.

25:35.100 --> 25:39.059
That's great. Old friends catching up.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.999
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

25:45.610 --> 25:49.376
What are you doing? I desperately,
desperately need a margarita.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.479
And you want me to come with you?

25:53.518 --> 25:57.852
Right. Great!
Well, let me just... or not.

25:59.925 --> 26:03.190
- She... No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did! Melanie Bose

26:03.261 --> 26:04.694
totally had the hots for you.

26:04.763 --> 26:07.323
So that's why you were
talking to me at that party?

26:07.432 --> 26:10.196
You were wing-woman
for the girl with the headgear?

26:11.169 --> 26:15.538
When she found out that we slept
together, she never talked to me again.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.074
That's because you were a college whore.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.111
I know!

26:21.746 --> 26:23.509
- Wow.
- What?

26:23.615 --> 26:27.107
I was just thinking, this is
a good week. George Michael's here.

26:27.185 --> 26:31.281
My case is interesting. And I haven't
laughed like this in a long time.

26:33.224 --> 26:34.748
Thanks for going out with me.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.054
It's my pleasure.

26:36.127 --> 26:39.392
With all that's going on with you,
I'm glad that I can be here.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.364
You don't know how nice it is to hear.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.732
Lately, I've been less
popular than Melanie Bose.

26:44.803 --> 26:46.771
You're going through a rough time.

26:46.871 --> 26:49.237
But think of all the people
that you've helped.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.206
OK, me and Ben for two.

26:51.276 --> 26:55.042
Winning that Beutel trial changed our
lives. I mean, you have to know that.

26:55.146 --> 26:58.809
I do know that.
It just doesn't change the fact that...

26:59.851 --> 27:03.218
- That I'm alone.
- I'm so sorry, Eli.

27:03.989 --> 27:05.752
God.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.793
I just broke rule number one.
You know?

27:08.893 --> 27:11.726
Don't tell a girl on a date with
that you're lonely!

27:11.796 --> 27:14.663
- Oh, God.
- What? Are you OK?

27:14.733 --> 27:17.759
Uh, yeah. No.

27:17.836 --> 27:22.603
Nate told me... He said
that he was gonna tell you today.

27:22.707 --> 27:25.005
Tell me what?

27:26.811 --> 27:28.711
- About you guys dating?
- Yeah.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.247
Of course he told me that!

27:30.315 --> 27:34.274
Thank God. Oh, my God. For a second
there, I thought you didn't know.

27:34.386 --> 27:37.355
Oh, no. Well, that would be awkward.

27:37.455 --> 27:40.083
To losers!
National order of total losers,

27:40.158 --> 27:43.855
San Francisco chapter, in session.

27:43.928 --> 27:47.887
What? Don't look at me like that. You
didn't have plans tonight either, loser.

27:47.999 --> 27:52.163
Believe me, I could've had plans.
Plenty of plans. With plenty of ladies.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.535
Fine. I'm the only loser then. To me!

27:54.606 --> 27:56.506
No, you're not a loser, Taylor.

27:56.574 --> 28:01.204
You're smart, you're hot,
you're funny... you're hot.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.212
And an excellent drinker.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.178
He's getting it out.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.018
- Who's getting what out?
- Eli.

28:10.989 --> 28:12.013
The aneurysm.

28:12.490 --> 28:16.051
Out. Bye-bye, aneurysm.

28:16.161 --> 28:18.652
Turns out, that's not
why he dumped me, anyway.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.391
What are you talking about?

28:21.132 --> 28:24.101
I thought he wanted to protect me.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.167
I thought he didn't
want me to see him suffer.

28:27.238 --> 28:29.900
Turns out the aneurysm
was just an excuse.

28:29.974 --> 28:33.341
Eli dumped me because he
just didn't love me enough.

28:34.946 --> 28:36.914
I don't know much about aneurysms,

28:36.981 --> 28:40.314
but something's gotta
be wrong if he dumped you.

28:41.252 --> 28:42.913
That's sweet.

28:42.987 --> 28:45.421
What you said in court today,
about your dad.

28:46.424 --> 28:49.552
Now I know why you have
to be so damn cocky all the time.

28:49.627 --> 28:53.393
Why you only date these vapid bimbos.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.597
You're scared
that you're gonna be abandoned

28:56.668 --> 28:59.159
by someone you actually care about.

29:01.840 --> 29:06.709
Sometimes it's just so hard
to be the real me.

29:22.327 --> 29:23.851
She told you.

29:24.696 --> 29:26.960
Have you any idea
how humiliating that was?

29:27.031 --> 29:30.398
- This isn't how I wanted...
- That finally, after months of misery

29:30.502 --> 29:33.471
and loneliness and visions,
I finally ask someone out,

29:33.571 --> 29:37.735
and I think we're making a connection,
only she's already dating my brother.

29:37.842 --> 29:40.902
- I was gonna tell you.
- I could tell from the way you didn't.

29:40.979 --> 29:45.040
We had come from the doctor. You have
life-altering decisions on your plate.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.381
- I didn't want to make things worse.
- By telling me you're happy?

29:48.453 --> 29:49.943
I was trying to protect you.

29:50.021 --> 29:51.386
Well, I'm a big boy, Nate.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.947
You dating Beth wouldn't
have even registered

29:54.025 --> 29:56.118
before I made an ass out of myself.

29:56.194 --> 29:59.357
OK, all right. So you would've said,
"Hey, that's great.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.490
My life is tanking worse
than the latest Ben Stiller movie,

30:02.567 --> 30:06.230
- but I'm so glad you're happy. "
- Maybe I would've, yeah. Who knows?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.402
I've been an idiot lately.

30:09.474 --> 30:14.309
I pushed Taylor away,
I pushed Maggie away, Patti, Chen...

30:14.379 --> 30:16.540
I thought no matter
how much an idiot I was,

30:16.648 --> 30:19.116
- I wouldn't push my brother away.
- You haven't.

30:19.184 --> 30:22.881
You've been dating the girl
I lost my virginity to for two months,

30:22.954 --> 30:25.514
- and you haven't mentioned it.
- I said I was sorry.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.850
You call the doctors,
make the appointments,

30:29.928 --> 30:32.829
but you don't want to go
anywhere near this decision,

30:32.897 --> 30:36.424
because you're afraid of how
you're gonna feel if it doesn't work,

30:36.501 --> 30:39.368
if I end up paralyzed or worse.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.776
You're a doctor.
But you're my big brother, man.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.210
And I need you now
more than ever.

30:48.680 --> 30:53.617
And if this is your idea of
helping me, thanks but no thanks.

30:55.119 --> 30:58.555
Eli, wait! Wait!

31:06.831 --> 31:09.857
Come on, kitty, move.
You're on my jacket!

31:10.335 --> 31:14.032
Give him a pet.
Sonny Bono loves to be touched.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.471
Your cat's name is Sonny Bono?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.501
That's so weird.

31:18.576 --> 31:21.511
It was between that and Jason Bourne.

31:21.579 --> 31:23.945
Trying to sneak out of here,
aren't you?

31:24.048 --> 31:28.712
Wow. I'm not sure I've ever
been snuck out on before.

31:28.786 --> 31:29.753
No, wait, I have.

31:29.854 --> 31:34.518
I'm not sneaking out, I've...
Just leaving. Quietly.

31:34.592 --> 31:35.559
I've got court.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.629
I know. With me.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.000
Please be seated.

31:47.272 --> 31:50.139
It is profoundly disturbing to me

31:50.208 --> 31:54.577
that one human being could willfully
deny another their last hope for life.

31:55.446 --> 31:58.006
But that doesn't change
the very real fact

31:58.116 --> 32:01.779
that there is no legal precedent
to support Judge Doyle's claim.

32:01.853 --> 32:05.414
The plaintiff's suit for breach
of contract and specific remedy

32:05.523 --> 32:09.186
of performance is hereby denied
and judgment granted to the defendant.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.302
Scott...

32:20.371 --> 32:23.067
Scott, I know I don't deserve
what I'm asking for,

32:23.141 --> 32:25.405
but please,
don't do anything that you...

32:29.881 --> 32:35.217
Mr. Michael, tell me, what inspired
your song, I Want Your Sex?

32:35.286 --> 32:38.255
A song, which rose to number one
on the world charts,

32:38.356 --> 32:41.792
a song that helped you win
a Grammy for Best Album of the Year.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.020
Well, it was inspired by a relationship.

32:44.128 --> 32:47.393
Like most of my work,
it was autobiographical.

32:47.465 --> 32:51.799
You heard Principal Ackerman describe
the song as encouraging promiscuity.

32:51.869 --> 32:53.564
But it's just the opposite.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.607
Ironically enough,
I wrote the song about abstinence.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.972
And I was in love
with someone at the time.

32:59.043 --> 33:01.910
How do you feel about
your song being used to protest

33:01.980 --> 33:04.949
an abstinence-only
sex education program?

33:05.016 --> 33:06.916
Well, I applaud it obviously.

33:06.985 --> 33:11.149
When I wrote it, we were
in year six of the AIDS crisis,

33:11.222 --> 33:14.680
a crisis that Ronald Reagan
did not even address publicly

33:14.759 --> 33:18.320
until there were
over 21,000 people dead.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.795
And what the government
is doing right now,

33:20.865 --> 33:26.633
funding federal programs that tell
children that condoms don't work,

33:26.738 --> 33:29.104
is killing people all over again.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.300
Thank you, Mr. Michael.

33:37.915 --> 33:40.782
These are the lyrics
to I Want Your Sex.

33:40.852 --> 33:45.016
- Please read the highlighted portion.
- "Sex is natural, sex is good,

33:45.123 --> 33:49.890
not everybody does it,
but everybody should. "

33:49.961 --> 33:50.928
Do you not think?

33:52.764 --> 33:57.133
Do you deny that these lyrics could be
understood to promote sexual activity?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.795
No, to deny that would be ridiculous.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.736
Nothing further, Your Honor.

34:01.839 --> 34:04.967
But would Ms. Abrams'
interpretation of the lyrics

34:05.043 --> 34:09.139
be appropriate in the context of an
abstinence-only sex education program?

34:09.213 --> 34:11.647
Well, I don't think I can answer that,

34:11.716 --> 34:17.382
because an abstinence-only
sex "education" program is an oxymoron.

34:17.455 --> 34:21.016
Abstinence can only be a choice
if you have all the facts.

34:21.092 --> 34:25.051
I love this country. I love the fact
that you guys have a constitution,

34:25.129 --> 34:28.223
that you practice
separation of church and state.

34:28.299 --> 34:32.167
But I don't think I'm alone in wondering
what's going on with that right now.

34:32.235 --> 34:35.000
And, in my opinion,

34:35.106 --> 34:39.065
right now, America could use
a lot more people like Molly.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.110
The whole world could.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.985
The clock is ticking.
Judge Tate's decision is imminent.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.750
My recommendation
would be to settle this now.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.052
Get out while you can.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.456
We don't want out.

34:55.525 --> 34:58.893
Judge Tate is not gonna insert herself
into a school matter.

34:58.963 --> 35:02.330
Consider Mr. Michael's testimony.
Judge Tate certainly will.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.596
All the negative media attention
has to be getting to you.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.968
Wait until George does
his press conference.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.063
A good point, sir.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.074
You know what, this isn't worth it.

35:11.142 --> 35:14.771
Enough is enough.
We'll reinstate Molly, all right?

35:14.846 --> 35:18.213
No! I did this to make a point.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.718
I want the school to have
a real sex education program.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.414
We've been through this.
There's no way. I'm sorry.

35:24.489 --> 35:28.152
The school can't have a sex-ed
program that doesn't receive funding.

35:28.226 --> 35:31.992
Actually, I think I know how we can
raise that kind of money in one night.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.096
A hero arises!

35:34.165 --> 35:35.996
How fast can you get a message out?

35:36.067 --> 35:38.228
Six seconds.

35:42.373 --> 35:44.398
There are avenues we can pursue.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.967
Other angles, more money.
Everyone has a price.

35:48.045 --> 35:50.741
Appeal to his mother.
She may see things our way.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.509
No, I...

35:54.585 --> 35:59.147
I think we all know I'm getting
exactly what I deserve.

36:00.291 --> 36:03.954
Judge, use what time you have left.

36:04.028 --> 36:05.996
Reach out. Make contact with your son.

36:06.531 --> 36:10.092
No, I'm... I'm done using
other people for my benefit.

36:10.201 --> 36:11.168
Then do it for his.

36:11.269 --> 36:14.397
His testimony was proof.
He needs to let go of that anger,

36:14.472 --> 36:16.133
otherwise he'll end up...

36:16.207 --> 36:17.674
Just like the Boil?

36:20.611 --> 36:25.844
You make a persuasive argument, Taylor.
And thank you both for everything.

36:34.425 --> 36:36.120
Nice picture, Mr. Dowd.

36:45.937 --> 36:49.805
- When was this picture taken?
- Uh... this summer.

36:51.509 --> 36:56.071
This man, with the familial resemblance,
would be your uncle?

36:56.581 --> 36:58.344
Your much older brother?

36:59.383 --> 37:02.716
Because I know there's no way
it's your deceased father.

37:02.787 --> 37:03.754
Taylor.

37:05.256 --> 37:08.748
I wanted to think that you were
a human being, but you are a pig.

37:08.826 --> 37:11.659
- OK, I lied.
- In court!

37:11.729 --> 37:15.165
Oh, come on! I wasn't under oath.
I was trying to win a case.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.997
How relevant is it whether or not
my father's alive?

37:18.069 --> 37:21.004
It's extremely relevant.
That is why I slept with you!

37:21.072 --> 37:24.701
Oh, come on, you didn't have
such a bad time last night.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.743
The quality of the time is irrelevant

37:26.844 --> 37:29.870
because last night was
a drunken, stupid mistake.

37:31.315 --> 37:33.875
Any chance we could
make the same mistake tonight?

37:33.951 --> 37:35.441
Not even the slightest.

37:35.519 --> 37:39.285
- OK. But if you change your mind...
- I won't.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.965
Interesting. Your new office.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.938
Well, square-footage-wise,
it's an improvement.

37:56.007 --> 37:59.443
Everything ready for tonight?
Insurance, security, lighting rentals?

37:59.510 --> 38:02.877
Yeah. One of the perks of having a
client roster as big as the phone book.

38:06.217 --> 38:10.449
- Can I help you with something, sir?
- I came by to...

38:13.924 --> 38:17.257
Apologies are difficult
for a man like me.

38:17.328 --> 38:20.422
- But gratitude...
- You helped me, sir.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.723
What I mean is...

38:25.202 --> 38:30.105
...it's been some time
since a case has made me,

38:30.174 --> 38:31.436
well, feel something.

38:34.045 --> 38:37.503
I can see why you've been
finding your new calling so fulfilling.

38:37.581 --> 38:39.549
Plus, you got to meet George Michael.

38:40.551 --> 38:43.418
- You don't think he noticed?
- It was barely obvious.

38:44.455 --> 38:47.947
I discovered his music back
in the early years of this firm.

38:48.025 --> 38:51.153
I was stuck on this
hellacious document production.

38:51.228 --> 38:56.063
Just me and a roomful of files,
working past midnight for three weeks.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.493
I'd stay so late,
it was just me and the cleaning crew.

39:00.571 --> 39:04.701
And one of them had
a boom box and all he played was...

39:04.775 --> 39:06.333
George Michael.

39:06.444 --> 39:09.971
Most nights, that music was
the only thing that kept me going.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.678
I still associate it
with my better days.

39:17.688 --> 39:21.556
I doubt those days really were better.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.115
They were.

39:24.795 --> 39:29.061
And now, as I enter
the waning side of my life...

39:30.034 --> 39:31.365
...losing everything...

39:32.470 --> 39:34.961
...is like the sun going down on me.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.667
- Mmm.
- Sorry.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.144
Thank you, Eli.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.815
This has been the best week
I've had in a long time.

39:57.595 --> 40:00.223
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:00.931 --> 40:01.898
You all right?

40:03.534 --> 40:05.001
I may be getting there.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.765
Look, I should've told you about Beth.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.533
And I should've...

40:09.607 --> 40:13.839
Nate. Shut up. You didn't do anything.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.603
Except the girl I lost my virginity to.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.383
Yeah, um...

40:22.186 --> 40:23.551
Gonna be weird between us?

40:23.621 --> 40:26.852
No. I'm used to weird by now.

40:26.924 --> 40:31.384
And you're my brother. And even
when I want to poke out your eyeballs...

40:32.730 --> 40:33.890
...I still love you.

40:35.199 --> 40:37.429
So...

40:37.501 --> 40:41.870
...I've been thinking
of Dr. Rajapaksa. He's our guy.

40:42.706 --> 40:44.367
You sure about that?

40:44.809 --> 40:49.576
- If you are.
- You're the doctor, and I trust you.

40:49.647 --> 40:52.548
Then he's the one we're picking.

40:52.616 --> 40:55.551
I'm sticking around to make sure
he's the right choice.

40:57.321 --> 40:59.289
Are you sure you want to do this?

40:59.356 --> 41:03.383
I have never been more
sure of anything in my life.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.362
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Jordan? He's gonna be just fine.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.295
You did a good thing this week, Eli.

41:08.365 --> 41:10.492
You're the one doing the good thing.

41:10.568 --> 41:14.129
A high school football stadium's
a step down from the Staples Center.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.832
It means the world to these kids.

41:15.906 --> 41:19.740
These days, you just have to do what
you can to try to make a difference.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.778
- Yeah.
- Can I give you a bit of advice?

41:22.246 --> 41:23.304
If anyone could...

41:23.380 --> 41:26.747
I know I've had my share of hits,
but I've taken a few hits too.

41:26.851 --> 41:28.819
And if there's anything I've learned,

41:28.919 --> 41:31.752
it's that no matter what,
you just have to keep going.

41:33.557 --> 41:36.458
- Do you know what I mean?
- I think I do.

41:36.527 --> 41:39.860
Good. Well, that's settled then.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.098
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. George Michael!
