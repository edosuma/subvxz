WEBVTT

00:55.707 --> 00:58.188
So it's the last
day of the Bonzer Rally

00:58.232 --> 00:59.798
here in the Land Down Under.

00:59.842 --> 01:04.542
And Archie Vainglorious is
still the driver to beat.

01:13.377 --> 01:14.900
Oh, come on.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.033
It looks like
Team Hot Spots race has just

01:17.077 --> 01:18.208
been cut short.

01:24.040 --> 01:24.519
Ha ha!

01:28.479 --> 01:29.959
What did I tell you, folks?

01:30.002 --> 01:32.657
Nobody's been able to
get close to Vainglorious

01:32.701 --> 01:37.575
since the amazing Gnash
mysteriously stopped racing.

01:37.619 --> 01:38.881
Thank you.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.274
So that's
one more rally cap

01:40.317 --> 01:44.452
for Archie Vainglorious.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.585
Legend, champ.

01:47.629 --> 01:51.502
One day, I'm going
to be the champ.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.852
Rebel.

02:10.782 --> 02:11.261
Yeah!

02:14.221 --> 02:14.743
Woo-hoo!

02:18.399 --> 02:20.401
Yeah!

02:20.444 --> 02:27.799
Once again, it's time for the
annual Slow Loris Day Festival

02:27.843 --> 02:28.887
here in the--

02:28.931 --> 02:31.194
Yeah!

02:31.238 --> 02:31.760
Wahoo!

02:36.460 --> 02:38.941
Coming through!

02:45.991 --> 02:48.559
Yeah!

02:48.603 --> 02:49.125
Waah!

02:52.041 --> 02:53.912
We have a new champion!

02:53.956 --> 02:55.610
The crowd is going wild!

02:55.653 --> 02:57.655
The crown is on its--

02:57.699 --> 02:58.178
oh.

03:01.093 --> 03:01.746
Weirdo.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.621
How shameful for your granny.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.194
That was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

03:14.237 --> 03:14.933
Really?

03:14.977 --> 03:17.719
Totally.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.242
I really like your helmet.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.112
Thanks.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.940
I painted it myself.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.551
It's a soup pot.

03:23.594 --> 03:24.987
I know.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.684
By the way, I'm Zhi.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.077
Hi, I'm--

03:28.120 --> 03:28.947
Zhi-zhi.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.645
Uh-oh, hide me, please.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.995
How many times do
I have to tell you?

03:33.038 --> 03:34.562
Ow, ow, ow!

03:34.605 --> 03:36.825
You need to stop with your
foolish racing fantasies.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.743
Granny Bai, Granny Bai.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.397
Uhm, nice meeting you.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.664
I swear he's
just a stubborn as you were.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.667
Look at it, my best soup pot.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.283
I don't get it, mama.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.938
Everyone thinks I'm a weirdo
when I'm just being me.

04:05.593 --> 04:08.770
And Granny, she
doesn't get me at all.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.338
She just makes me
practice Tai Chi.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.341
Tai Chi is how we
lorises slow down

04:14.384 --> 04:20.651
the world by allowing the breath
of life to flow through us.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.183
Whoa!

04:31.227 --> 04:33.795
And she makes me trim plants.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.275
The
tree just knows how

04:35.318 --> 04:38.016
to grow, the leaves to bloom.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.018
This is their Dao.

04:40.062 --> 04:45.110
The question you must
answer is, what is your Dao?

04:49.201 --> 04:50.507
But I don't care

04:50.551 --> 04:52.596
about that kind of stuff, mama.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.728
I just want to race.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.961
Mama, mama!

05:10.005 --> 05:12.094
I got a slot in tonight's race.

05:12.137 --> 05:15.924
And I know I can win this one.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.753
Oh, hey, don't tell Granny, OK?

05:18.796 --> 05:19.623
Who's racing?

05:19.667 --> 05:20.494
I'm racing.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.625
Who's racing?

05:21.669 --> 05:22.583
I'm racing.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.627
Who's racing?

05:23.671 --> 05:24.628
This guy.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.543
I am racing.

05:26.587 --> 05:27.109
Whoa!

05:30.939 --> 05:32.636
And it
looks like it's

05:32.680 --> 05:36.161
going to be a drag race into the
final stretch with Local Loris

05:36.205 --> 05:37.380
Zhi on the move.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.210
Zhi finds his pocket.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.520
And he takes the lead.

05:46.563 --> 05:47.434
This is it.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.435
I got this.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.523
I totally got this.

05:53.483 --> 05:54.963
Oh!

05:58.445 --> 06:01.404
Ahh, ahh!

06:01.448 --> 06:02.927
Wah-- ahh!

06:08.411 --> 06:09.325
Oof!

06:09.369 --> 06:10.544
Ugh-- ugh.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.550
Urgh--

06:16.593 --> 06:20.075
Ooh, and with no
one to blame but himself--

06:20.989 --> 06:22.817
--that has got to sting.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.695
Hey, kid.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.654
Why the cloudy face?

06:33.697 --> 06:36.918
Oh, hey, Gnash.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.223
I saw you out there tonight.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.573
You looked pretty good.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.096
Ha.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.837
I think you might need to
get your glasses fixed.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.058
Eh, I learned long ago to
trust my gut, not my eyes.

06:47.102 --> 06:47.581
Ooh.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.239
Ah?

06:54.283 --> 06:57.329
Pretty good, right?

06:57.373 --> 06:59.462
OK, how about this one?

07:04.032 --> 07:09.037
Winners are always winning
even when they're losing.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.867
Hmm, I-- I got to go.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.509
Do we have to do this?

07:46.553 --> 07:50.948
Yes, your D is blocked again.

08:03.613 --> 08:04.527
Hey, check it out.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.356
Tai Chi with a beetle--

08:07.399 --> 08:08.139
Tai Chitle.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.549
Wow.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.551
Tai Chitle is not a thing.

08:31.815 --> 08:32.990
Off you go.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.297
I'm begging your
pardon, Granny Bai.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.125
I'm worried about you.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.519
When will you find your Dao?

08:39.562 --> 08:41.085
How do you know I haven't?

08:41.129 --> 08:44.785
Because Dao is
the path to harmony.

08:44.828 --> 08:48.615
And this, this is
not harmonious.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.660
What if that's because
I have a different path?

08:50.704 --> 08:51.748
And this is it.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.271
It's just a loop--

08:53.315 --> 08:56.927
a never-ending loop of
humiliation and rejection.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.147
What if this is my harmony?

08:59.190 --> 08:59.930
It's not.

09:03.586 --> 09:04.892
Whoa!

09:04.935 --> 09:07.938
What is going on?

09:07.982 --> 09:09.113
What the--

09:09.157 --> 09:09.723
That's it.

09:09.766 --> 09:10.593
That's it.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.638
Down it goes.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.046
Vainglorious Industries?

09:29.090 --> 09:31.179
Like Archie Vainglorious?

09:32.702 --> 09:34.661
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS : Congratulations.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.185
Your lovely home has
been hand-selected

09:37.228 --> 09:41.406
by me, Archie Vainglorious,
for total repossession

09:41.450 --> 09:43.365
and extreme demolition.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.758
Demolition?

09:44.801 --> 09:46.629
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS : Yes, demolition.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.284
Echo, diabolical laugh.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.985
ARCHIE VAINGLORIOUS : Have a nice day.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.639
How can they do this?

09:59.337 --> 10:00.077
No.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.470
Don't cry, Granny.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.951
This has to be some kind
of misunderstanding.

10:03.994 --> 10:07.737
I'm going to go and try
to sort this out somehow.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.683
Whoa!

10:40.727 --> 10:42.642
And Archie
Vainglorious has just

10:42.685 --> 10:44.295
taken the Bonzer Rally Cup.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.167
Ooh.

10:46.210 --> 10:46.689
What the?

10:51.215 --> 10:55.350
Whoa, that's a big toad.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.228
Huh?

11:17.241 --> 11:18.155
Right, who are you?

11:18.199 --> 11:19.679
And who let you in?

11:19.722 --> 11:21.506
Oh, hi.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.682
My name's Zhi.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.075
But usually, people call me Zhi.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.338
I'm a-- I'm a huge fan.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.079
Of course, you are.

11:31.865 --> 11:35.825
Congratulations, you met
me, Archie Vainglorious.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.657
OK.

11:41.701 --> 11:46.053
Thanks, but I actually
came for something else.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.881
I'm from the Slow Loris Village.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.622
And I want to talk
about my Granny's house.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.886
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.802
I mean, what would a cane
toad and a legendary racer

11:55.845 --> 11:58.413
like you even want with
the Slow Loris Village?

11:58.456 --> 11:59.806
Nothing.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.329
That's why I'm going to
plow it and flood it.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.461
Let me show you.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.332
Ahh!

12:04.375 --> 12:06.813
Wait, wait, wait-- ahh!

12:06.856 --> 12:10.251
Muddy Meadows-- luxury,
high-end swamplands

12:10.294 --> 12:12.079
for the posh toad set.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.776
Muddy Meadows?

12:13.820 --> 12:16.474
It tested better
than Funky Fields.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.955
But it's the last Slow
Loris Village in China.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.827
How can you even be
allowed to do this?

12:20.870 --> 12:23.177
Quite easily, actually,
because who really

12:23.220 --> 12:25.005
knows what a Slow Loris is?

12:25.048 --> 12:28.051
Hey, now, if you were
pandas, forget about it.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.879
But slow lorises?

12:29.923 --> 12:32.142
Please, who even cares?

12:32.186 --> 12:33.665
I do!

12:33.709 --> 12:36.103
OK, OK, no need to get
your knickers in a twist.

12:36.146 --> 12:40.063
You and your Granny still
have 10 days to pay.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.543
10 days?

12:41.586 --> 12:44.067
We can't raise this
much money in 10 days.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.416
Well, in that case--

12:49.420 --> 12:50.334
Huh?

12:50.378 --> 12:50.813
Hold on.

12:50.857 --> 12:51.553
Hold on.

12:51.596 --> 12:52.684
Hey, hey, wait.

12:52.728 --> 12:57.037
Oh, coming soon.

12:57.080 --> 13:02.129
Ah The Silk Road Rally,
Kashgar to Shanghai.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.566
Oh, it's going to be epic.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.524
It's a little
presumptuous, isn't it?

13:06.568 --> 13:08.004
Building a trophy case?

13:08.048 --> 13:10.093
I mean, you haven't
even won yet.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.312
But I will.

13:11.355 --> 13:14.271
Let me break it down
for you, fellow.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.665
Daddy, grandaddy,
my imbecile brothers

13:16.708 --> 13:18.058
helped me join in
on the business.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.494
Help us bump the numbers.

13:19.537 --> 13:20.538
Real estate is boring.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.018
It's really quite a blunder.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.107
So they bring the coins
while I bring the thunder.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.326
The fastest car, I got it.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.936
Your village, I bought it.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.982
It makes my daddy proud to
have our name in gold on it.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.332
Rally after rally, knocking
trophies down like pins.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.421
Plain and simple, loris,
Vainglorious wins.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.906
The album drops next year.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.868
You seem pretty confident
you're going to win.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.565
Willing to stake a bet on it?

13:47.609 --> 13:48.871
What do you have in mind?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.003
If I win the cup--

13:50.046 --> 13:50.873
Wait!

13:50.917 --> 13:52.309
You?

13:52.353 --> 13:53.920
You are the one who
is personally going

13:53.963 --> 13:56.313
to be doing the beating of me?

13:56.357 --> 13:57.793
I laugh at the idea.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.194
I know it's crazy.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.064
Sorry, little champ.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.587
You were saying?

14:09.631 --> 14:12.373
If I win, you give me
the deed to Granny's house

14:12.416 --> 14:13.940
free and clear.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.681
Such hutzpah, I love it!

14:16.725 --> 14:18.509
I accept your bet.

14:18.553 --> 14:24.167
But if I win, you become
the face of Muddy Meadows.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.081
Me?

14:25.125 --> 14:26.474
But I'm not a toad.

14:26.517 --> 14:31.261
No, but you are
toad-ally adorable.

14:31.305 --> 14:35.744
See you at the starting
line, slow loris.

14:35.787 --> 14:36.614
Slow loris.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.881
Super nice guy.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.883
I look forward to
annihilating him.

14:53.066 --> 14:56.112
Why the long face, kid?

14:56.156 --> 15:04.599
I kind of have to sort of race
the Silk Road Rally and win it.

15:04.642 --> 15:07.080
The Silk Road Rally?

15:07.123 --> 15:10.779
Oh, that the race
is no holds barred.

15:10.822 --> 15:14.478
200 miles per hour
for four days straight

15:14.522 --> 15:19.179
across unforgiving terrain
against the craziest drivers

15:19.222 --> 15:19.962
in the world.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.317
Yeah, so why would you
want to get mixed up

15:27.361 --> 15:29.450
in the kamikaze
mission like that?

15:29.493 --> 15:30.973
Because it's
the only shot I've

15:31.017 --> 15:35.195
got as saving our house
from becoming Muddy Meadows.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.674
I don't follow.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.807
If I don't win that
cup, Vainglorious Industry

15:38.850 --> 15:40.678
is going to tear down our house.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.419
Vainglorious?

15:42.463 --> 15:44.769
As in Archie Vainglorious?

15:44.813 --> 15:46.249
I know!

15:46.293 --> 15:48.512
How am I going to beat the
best racer in the world?

15:50.514 --> 15:53.300
I'm in way
over my head, Gnash.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.827
Our home is all we have.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.698
It's my mom's final
resting place.

16:04.876 --> 16:05.877
Hmm.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.967
All right, kid, come with me.

16:11.622 --> 16:12.667
Whoa!

16:12.710 --> 16:14.408
This place is awesome.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.988
You were a race car driver?

16:29.031 --> 16:31.642
I've been lots of things.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.644
So this is how I see it, kid.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.603
You are like this part.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.607
You got everything you need,
but it's just a tangled up mess.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.435
It can't do you any good.

16:41.478 --> 16:45.047
But you and me together--

16:48.181 --> 16:50.009
--mm-- ooh.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.575
Looking good, Gnash.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.882
Looking real good.

16:53.925 --> 16:57.407
Together, there ain't
nothing we can't do.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.151
Together like me and you?

17:02.195 --> 17:04.980
Yeah, I've probably seen
every one of your crashes--

17:05.024 --> 17:06.025
I mean, races.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.417
You have?

17:07.461 --> 17:08.940
You've got raw talent.

17:08.984 --> 17:12.379
And you've got guts, but
you're missing something.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.989
I can help you find it.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.079
But only if you're
willing to listen.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.515
No questions asked.

17:18.559 --> 17:19.821
You would do that?

17:19.864 --> 17:21.388
But why?

17:21.431 --> 17:23.085
OK, that was two questions
right off the line there.

17:23.129 --> 17:27.959
What part of no questions
asked did you not understand?

17:28.003 --> 17:31.876
Hey, the heart of a champion
beats in all of us, kid.

17:31.920 --> 17:32.616
See you tomorrow.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.407
That apple really didn't fall
far from the tree, did it?

17:54.421 --> 17:55.074
I know.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.684
I know.

17:56.727 --> 18:01.732
I said I was walking away
for good, but he's your son.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.125
What am I supposed to do?

18:08.174 --> 18:09.392
Birds got to fly.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.090
Fishes got to swim.

18:11.133 --> 18:15.181
And the goat-- well, a
goat has got to race.

18:24.015 --> 18:28.019
So Zhi-zhi, how did
it go with Vainglorious?

18:28.063 --> 18:30.152
Yeah, good.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.197
Very good.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.502
Yeah, I have it under control.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.592
Just leave it-- leave it at me.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.726
I just have to go
away for a while.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.119
Go away?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.164
Where?

18:42.208 --> 18:52.043
To How to Defeat an
Evil Cane Toad TedTalk?

18:52.087 --> 18:53.306
I got to go.

18:53.349 --> 18:54.263
See you later, Granny.

18:57.484 --> 19:01.705
You do know that when he lies
to me, his left eye twitches.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.534
Exactly the same way yours did.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.148
OK, kid.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.628
Let's talk about your last race.

19:11.672 --> 19:16.155
It was yours to win, but then--

19:16.198 --> 19:17.112
Ugh.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.635
So what happened?

19:18.679 --> 19:19.897
Do you see that guy's car?

19:19.941 --> 19:21.464
If I had a car like that--

19:22.161 --> 19:22.987
What the?

19:23.031 --> 19:24.424
Cars don't win races.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.731
Drivers do.

19:27.775 --> 19:31.344
Although, yeah, we actually
are going to need a car.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.216
What?

19:34.260 --> 19:36.958
Appearance is an illusion.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.264
It's what's inside that counts.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.620
Reluctantly
crouched at the starting line.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.318
Engines pumping and
thumping in time.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.667
The green light flashes.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.103
The flames go up.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.497
Churning and burning,
they yearn for the cup.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.544
They deftly maneuver
and muscle for rank.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.242
Fuel burning fast
on an empty tank.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.636
Reckless and wild, they
pour through the turns.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.116
Their prowess is potent
and secretly stern.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.902
As they speed through the
finish, the flags go down.

20:07.945 --> 20:08.946
The fans get up.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.600
And they get out of town.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.645
The sun has gone down.

20:11.688 --> 20:12.994
And the moon has gone up.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.517
Ha!

20:14.561 --> 20:16.127
And long ago,
somebody left with the cup.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.129
But he's driving and striving
and hugging the turns

20:18.173 --> 20:19.174
and thinking of someone--

20:19.218 --> 20:22.221
OK, let's see what you got.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.180
He's
going the distance.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.183
He's going for speed.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.619
She's all alone.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.142
All alone.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.235
It's just like
in his last race.

20:36.278 --> 20:40.282
The moment he takes
the lead, he chokes.

20:40.326 --> 20:44.330
The key to winning is focusing
on the road ahead of you.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.424
Also, not crashing
into walls is good.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.260
He always gets nervous
when he's ahead.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.134
Oh, oh, oh.

21:06.177 --> 21:06.656
Whoa!

21:10.660 --> 21:13.446
Maybe if I hold him back--

21:13.489 --> 21:14.098
that's it!

21:18.364 --> 21:18.842
Not yet.

21:22.629 --> 21:23.586
Not yet.

21:26.894 --> 21:27.373
Now.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.424
That was awesome!

21:40.037 --> 21:41.430
Ha, ha, ha!

21:41.474 --> 21:42.388
Go, Gnash.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.998
Yeah.

21:44.041 --> 21:44.912
Yeah, I like it.

21:47.610 --> 21:48.132
Pathetic.

21:50.831 --> 21:51.310
Moronic.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.271
Beyond ridiculous.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.752
Oh, this is too easy.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.014
Seahorses?

22:00.057 --> 22:02.538
Seriously?

22:02.582 --> 22:03.931
Hold the line.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.063
Who's this?

22:06.107 --> 22:08.327
The Amazing Gnash?

22:08.370 --> 22:09.937
Right.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.896
Well, you're not nearly as
dead as I thought you were.

22:16.900 --> 22:20.208
Hmm, this is quite the wrinkle.

22:20.251 --> 22:25.735
If you're in the
race, I could lose.

22:28.695 --> 22:29.609
It's V.

22:29.652 --> 22:30.958
What do you want?

22:31.001 --> 22:34.396
I'm ready for you to
repay me that favor.

22:34.440 --> 22:39.532
Neil will be in touch
with further instructions.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.789
Welcome race
fans to the Silk Road Rally.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.356
I am Abby Jacks.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.315
And with me, at the repeated
request of my husband,

23:24.359 --> 23:28.407
is my sister-in-law,
Juni Hakansdotter.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.583
Hey, that's me.

23:39.026 --> 23:44.335
And hailing from
India, India's team, Tandem.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.860
I wonder how they
put their pants on.

23:46.903 --> 23:50.951
And there they are,
the British Invasion.

23:50.994 --> 23:54.563
And straight out of South
Central, China, Bling

23:54.607 --> 23:55.346
and Bling.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.221
Good
morning race fans

24:00.264 --> 24:04.312
and welcome to the main event.

24:04.355 --> 24:05.661
Ha-ha!

24:06.880 --> 24:09.709
Who
let the frog out?

24:09.752 --> 24:12.668
I got him.

24:12.712 --> 24:15.062
Who let the frog out?

24:15.105 --> 24:16.629
Who
let the frog out?

24:16.672 --> 24:17.847
And,
of course, no race

24:17.891 --> 24:19.501
would be complete
without an entry

24:19.545 --> 24:22.983
from Britain's notorious,
Team Vainglorious.

24:23.026 --> 24:25.725
Oh, he looks slimy.

24:25.768 --> 24:26.639
Come on, kid.

24:26.682 --> 24:29.903
Let's get out of here.

24:29.946 --> 24:30.904
Hey.

24:32.775 --> 24:35.082
I'm just so excited.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.084
By Vainglorious?

24:37.127 --> 24:38.825
No, by this.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.828
I'm due in less than two weeks.

24:41.871 --> 24:42.655
Wait.

24:42.698 --> 24:43.525
What?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.484
I'm pregnant.

24:45.527 --> 24:46.833
Oh, men.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.704
We are such a miracles, eh?

24:48.748 --> 24:51.490
Oh, I'm Berpe,
Team Wet Lightning.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.753
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.406
I'm Zhi.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.757
Berpe, would you get your
sweet little tail over here?

24:57.800 --> 24:59.802
Race is about to start.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.412
That's my Adalina.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.763
Well, Zhi, good luck out there.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.467
Long before the
internet connected the world,

25:12.511 --> 25:14.861
there was the
legendary Silk Road.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.906
A road that's made of silk?

25:16.950 --> 25:18.778
I can't believe this.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.214
No, it's not made of--

25:20.257 --> 25:21.781
forget it.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.697
The course is a 4,000 clickhorse
straight across China.

25:24.740 --> 25:28.265
The race will take place in
four legs over four days.

25:28.309 --> 25:31.878
And the racer with the shortest
overall time takes the cup.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.184
Other than that,
there are no rules.

26:02.343 --> 26:04.563
And as the racers
wait at the line,

26:04.606 --> 26:06.565
they're all thinking
the same thing.

26:06.608 --> 26:07.914
Did I remember

26:07.957 --> 26:09.829
to put on my
fireproof underpants?

26:09.872 --> 26:12.614
No, just
for one brief moment,

26:12.658 --> 26:14.703
it's still anyone's cup.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.629
Remember Vainglorious
drives dirty.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.805
And he doesn't waste any time.

26:29.849 --> 26:30.763
Trust me.

26:31.851 --> 26:32.373
Are you ready, Steve?

26:32.416 --> 26:32.895
Uh-huh.

26:32.939 --> 26:33.853
Andy?

26:33.896 --> 26:34.854
Yeah.

26:34.897 --> 26:35.811
Mick?

26:35.855 --> 26:37.291
OK.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.206
All right, fellas.

26:39.249 --> 26:39.728
Let's go.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.301
Vainglorious
wastes no time

26:47.344 --> 26:48.389
trying to clear the field.

26:48.432 --> 26:48.868
Look out!

26:48.911 --> 26:49.390
Ah!

27:00.749 --> 27:01.881
You weren't kidding.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.447
That toad is crazy.

27:03.491 --> 27:06.450
You said you wanted to
race the Silk Road Rally.

27:06.494 --> 27:09.671
Welcome to it.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.673
And the racers
begin to make their way

27:11.717 --> 27:14.458
across the Taklamakan Desert.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.199
You're supposed to
be out of the race.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.287
Supposed to be.

27:20.769 --> 27:21.422
Ah!

27:21.465 --> 27:22.075
Get it off!

27:22.118 --> 27:22.771
Get it off!

27:22.815 --> 27:24.468
Ah, new idea.

27:24.512 --> 27:25.469
Echoes, attack.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.257
Haha!

27:33.739 --> 27:35.218
Gah!

27:38.613 --> 27:40.223
Ballroom
blitz, ballroom blitz.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.704
Ballroom blitz.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.185
Ballroom blitz.

27:45.228 --> 27:47.187
Ballroom blitz.

27:47.230 --> 27:50.103
And here comes
Argentina's Team Kale

27:50.146 --> 27:53.062
driving a car with no
steering wheel at all.

27:56.022 --> 27:56.544
Ah!

28:08.948 --> 28:10.950
Holy
molly, newbie team

28:10.993 --> 28:14.257
Muddy Meadows just took
the lead from Vainglorious.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.433
Enjoy the moment, loris.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.219
It will not last.

28:19.262 --> 28:20.263
Diabolical laugh.

28:24.006 --> 28:24.659
Oh, yeah!

28:28.576 --> 28:31.013
I can't get him off my tail.

28:34.930 --> 28:35.844
All right, kid.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.585
It's all about focus now.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.152
Enter the zone.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.240
No distraction.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.415
OK, I get it.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.025
Hey, is that a loris?

28:43.069 --> 28:44.897
I'm pretty sure it's
a loris right there.

28:44.940 --> 28:45.767
Gee, focus.

28:45.811 --> 28:46.289
Whoa!

28:49.815 --> 28:50.772
Whoa!

28:50.816 --> 28:51.512
You're right.

28:51.555 --> 28:52.382
That is a loris.

28:52.426 --> 28:53.166
We should stop.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.167
What?

28:54.210 --> 28:55.690
I was to say we just-- stop!

28:55.734 --> 28:57.648
Ta-ta, loser!

28:57.692 --> 28:58.780
Unbelievable!

28:58.824 --> 29:02.349
The lead car just
chucked to U-ey.

29:02.392 --> 29:03.872
What are you doing?

29:03.916 --> 29:05.178
No questions asked.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.483
You agreed.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.094
Gnash!

29:08.137 --> 29:09.486
Oh, come on, Gnash.

29:09.530 --> 29:10.444
Get back here.

29:11.488 --> 29:12.881
Huh--

29:14.665 --> 29:15.362
Hmm?

29:15.405 --> 29:16.406
What--

29:16.450 --> 29:17.668
Hey, Neil.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.279
It's been a long time.

29:19.322 --> 29:23.152
Well, if it isn't
the Average Gnash.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.675
Seriously?

29:24.719 --> 29:26.199
15 years, that's the best
you could come up with?

29:34.555 --> 29:35.774
Hey, you OK over here?

29:35.817 --> 29:38.037
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.255
Whoa!

29:39.299 --> 29:43.999
Wow, this is heavier
than it looks.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.567
Whoa, you're a loris.

29:46.610 --> 29:47.089
Uh.

29:54.531 --> 29:59.362
So you got a name or--

29:59.406 --> 30:01.321
Uh.

30:01.364 --> 30:04.193
What if I just
call you Speedy?

30:04.237 --> 30:06.979
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.284
Uh, uh-huh.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.634
A racer and a great
conversationalist--

30:10.678 --> 30:11.592
my lucky day.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.988
Gnash, you all right?

30:16.031 --> 30:17.250
Never better.

30:17.293 --> 30:18.338
Hey, you dropped this.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.427
Huh?

30:20.470 --> 30:22.255
Well, that was fun.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.691
I don't think that
tiger is going

30:23.734 --> 30:25.388
to give you any more grief.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.216
You'd be surprised.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.739
Thanks for stopping guys.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.830
And maybe I'll see you
around sometimes, Speedy.

30:31.873 --> 30:32.961
Uh.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.136
Aw.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.094
Sorry to break
up the fun, kids.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.356
Gnash, don't--

30:36.399 --> 30:38.010
But we have to get
back to our race.

30:38.053 --> 30:39.141
Bye.

30:39.185 --> 30:42.623
Nice meeting you.

30:42.666 --> 30:46.279
Penny for your
thoughts, Speedy?

30:46.322 --> 30:47.236
Huh?

30:47.280 --> 30:48.890
Oh, it's nothing.

30:48.934 --> 30:49.412
All good.

31:00.946 --> 31:03.339
Oh, there you are, Shelby.

31:03.383 --> 31:04.950
I'm dying to hear.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.516
Give me the deets.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.171
Why didn't you tell me
that your mark was a loris?

31:09.215 --> 31:11.130
What a scintillating question.

31:11.173 --> 31:12.958
Let me have a think on that.

31:13.001 --> 31:14.437
I don't know.

31:14.481 --> 31:17.658
Maybe because, uh,
you work for me!

31:17.701 --> 31:18.964
So what happened?

31:19.007 --> 31:20.487
Let's just say
your pet kitty is

31:20.530 --> 31:22.706
going to have quite the
headache when he wakes up.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.012
Sorry, I don't follow.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.362
Your tiger couldn't
handle the goat.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.546
Vainglorious will be
the first to throw his name up

31:36.590 --> 31:37.939
on the leaderboard.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.767
But with three more
days of racing ahead,

31:39.810 --> 31:41.943
this race is far from over.

31:41.987 --> 31:45.033
Wait, so
this race is actually four days.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.992
You cost us the race.

31:47.035 --> 31:49.733
Races aren't won or lost
until the final second.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.130
We were ahead.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.523
Why would you make a stop?

32:05.445 --> 32:09.840
Feel with
your gut, not with your eyes.

32:09.884 --> 32:11.799
That's not what I sound like.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.193
Let's
do a whole training montage.

32:14.236 --> 32:17.544
But then, let's make it
totally irrelevant by stopping

32:17.587 --> 32:19.111
and blowing our time.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.374
I don't know
where this kid has come from,

32:21.417 --> 32:23.332
but he's clearly come to win.

32:23.376 --> 32:24.986
Oh, I know this one.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.206
He came from China.

32:27.249 --> 32:27.858
Oh, Madonna.

32:32.994 --> 32:36.215
Sixth place--
super impressive--

32:36.258 --> 32:38.173
on opposite day.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.479
Sixth place?

32:39.522 --> 32:40.871
You did great, kid.

32:40.915 --> 32:42.525
I was in the lead.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.614
Which is when
you always lose it.

32:44.658 --> 32:48.531
But when you're behind, kid,
you're a force of nature.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.712
Zhi, how could
you not have told me

32:55.756 --> 32:57.236
that you are such a driver?

32:57.279 --> 32:58.585
Fantastico!

32:58.628 --> 33:00.326
Fantastico?

33:00.369 --> 33:02.284
Anyone else would
have come in last

33:02.328 --> 33:04.460
after stopping
like you did today.

33:04.504 --> 33:08.899
But then, oh,
watching you drive,

33:08.943 --> 33:11.598
it's like a poetry in motion.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.082
I need a snack.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.562
I don't know, maybe a pint of
ice cream and some seaweed pad

33:19.606 --> 33:20.085
thai.

33:40.757 --> 33:43.499
I know why he's
doing it, but I'm still

33:43.543 --> 33:46.937
terrified every time he
walks out of that gate.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.987
Watch over him up there, OK?

33:57.861 --> 33:59.298
For both of us.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.824
Who could that be at this hour?

34:11.919 --> 34:14.748
Oh my dears, come in, come in.

34:14.791 --> 34:15.575
Oh, thank you.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.464
What the?

34:35.508 --> 34:37.336
That was seriously me?

34:37.379 --> 34:38.641
How did I--

34:38.685 --> 34:39.947
Not a big
fan of parties, huh?

34:39.990 --> 34:41.644
Who said that?

34:41.688 --> 34:42.384
Hey!

34:42.428 --> 34:43.864
You, wait up.

34:43.907 --> 34:46.345
Hey, where did you go?

34:46.388 --> 34:48.738
Oh, hey.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.000
Hey, hi.

34:50.044 --> 34:53.221
It's-- it's you.

34:53.265 --> 34:56.268
Oh, I see you've been working
on your conversation skills.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.139
Ha!

34:58.183 --> 35:03.013
my conversation skills, because
that's what you said last time.

35:03.057 --> 35:05.364
So sixth place, huh, Speedy?

35:05.407 --> 35:06.800
It could be worse.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.149
Hmm.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.890
Oh, I get it.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.631
You're one of those
all-or-nothing racers.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.676
And it's just all
about the trophy.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.591
I wouldn't say that exactly.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.246
OK, so you're more of
the fame and glory type.

35:18.290 --> 35:21.293
I don't think
that's it either.

35:21.336 --> 35:22.903
Then what are you?

35:22.946 --> 35:25.210
Well, I'm really only
here for my Granny.

35:25.253 --> 35:29.257
I'm trying to save our home
from this psychotic toad.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.693
Save your home?

35:30.737 --> 35:31.564
Yeah.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.174
And not just my home.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.394
He's actually planning on
destroying the entire loris

35:35.437 --> 35:36.351
village.

35:36.395 --> 35:37.831
The entire loris village?

35:37.874 --> 35:39.137
Yeah.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.138
And it's going to
kill my Granny Bai.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.574
I just know it.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.097
Granny Bai?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.054
Granny Bai!

35:44.098 --> 35:44.751
Wait!

35:44.794 --> 35:46.187
You're that Zhi?

35:46.231 --> 35:47.536
I don't know.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.235
I guess it depends which
Zhi you think I am.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.585
From the park at the
Loris Day Festival.

35:52.628 --> 35:56.632
When we were kids, you were
wearing a painted soup pot

35:56.676 --> 35:57.633
on your head.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.069
That was you?

35:59.113 --> 36:03.117
I looked for you a lot,
but I couldn't find you.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.901
I never even knew your name.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.599
I still don't know your name.

36:06.642 --> 36:07.991
It's Shelby.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.037
Shelby.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.865
Why didn't I ever see you again?

36:11.908 --> 36:15.956
We moved to the
city for my dad's job.

36:15.999 --> 36:20.047
My last happy memories are
actually in that village.

36:23.485 --> 36:25.661
What?

36:25.705 --> 36:29.796
I just can't believe it's
really you after all this time.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.101
I know.

36:31.145 --> 36:34.061
This is-- this is crazy.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.018
What are the chances?

36:40.981 --> 36:43.331
No, go back.

36:43.375 --> 36:48.249
Uh-- uh, what do you
say we take a walk, Speedy?

36:48.293 --> 36:49.337
What's going on?

36:49.381 --> 36:50.382
Nothing.

36:50.425 --> 36:52.384
I just need to stretch my quads.

36:52.427 --> 36:53.820
Stretch your quads?

36:59.434 --> 37:01.044
I bet he's over you.

37:01.088 --> 37:02.568
I don't think he knows others.

37:18.366 --> 37:21.282
Time for round 2.

37:23.806 --> 37:24.894
Here, kitty, kitty.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.644
Not smart.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.083
Mm-mm-mm.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.306
And welcome, folks.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.395
It's fight night at
the Happy Pagoda.

37:47.439 --> 37:48.918
Oh, I'm love a theme party.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.189
So tell me something.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.669
What happened to old Bing?

38:00.713 --> 38:02.671
Did she ever actually
start bottling and selling

38:02.715 --> 38:03.498
her own tea?

38:03.542 --> 38:04.891
No.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.153
But she's still claiming
that when she does,

38:06.196 --> 38:07.197
she's going to be--

38:07.241 --> 38:08.764
Steeped in tea money.

38:10.418 --> 38:11.898
Oh, what about
the Chu triplets?

38:11.941 --> 38:13.073
Are they still there?

38:13.116 --> 38:14.379
Yeah, they're
all still there--

38:14.422 --> 38:15.728
I think.

38:15.771 --> 38:17.251
I'm not really sure, actually.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.687
It's kind of hard to tell.

38:26.782 --> 38:29.698
Hey, you think
you want to maybe--

38:29.742 --> 38:31.483
I don't know.

38:31.526 --> 38:35.008
Are you asking me
to dance, Speedy?

38:35.051 --> 38:36.096
I mean I--

38:41.406 --> 38:44.104
Aw.

38:44.147 --> 38:46.846
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.761
Please check the
number and try again.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.026
Gnash is in there.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.114
Oh, OK.

38:54.157 --> 38:54.636
Bye.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.077
Whoa, that the--

39:01.121 --> 39:02.383
Gnash, hold on!

39:02.427 --> 39:03.123
I'm coming.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.740
Oh, snack time.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.220
Whoa.

39:13.263 --> 39:13.916
Ahh--

39:15.744 --> 39:16.919
Oh, boy.

39:22.838 --> 39:23.796
What is going on?

39:27.103 --> 39:27.974
This is weird.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.065
Wait a minute.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.632
Is this what Granny was
always talking about?

39:41.248 --> 39:42.597
Holy golly.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.033
Did you see that?

39:44.077 --> 39:47.080
I did not.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.777
Oh, this is interesting.

40:01.486 --> 40:02.225
Excuse me.

40:06.099 --> 40:07.056
Thank you.

40:21.244 --> 40:23.638
Not bad, Speedy.

40:23.682 --> 40:24.857
Not bad at all.

40:31.994 --> 40:33.561
Well, good day, race fans.

40:33.605 --> 40:35.084
It's Abby Jacks.

40:35.128 --> 40:37.435
And welcome back to day
2 of the Silk Road Rally.

40:45.355 --> 40:47.749
Oh, not necessary at all.

40:47.793 --> 40:51.100
Well, obviously,
absolutely necessary.

40:51.144 --> 40:54.060
They're not the
cheering for you.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.062
Of course, they
are, horse of the sea

40:56.105 --> 40:58.368
who is hardly a horse at all.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.153
I don't think so.

41:00.196 --> 41:03.199
They are cheering
for my best friend.

41:03.243 --> 41:08.074
Videos of Zhi saving me and
by bambinos have gone viral.

41:08.117 --> 41:09.554
Viral?

41:09.597 --> 41:12.513
He doesn't even have a
social media coordinator.

41:18.911 --> 41:19.868
Zhi!

41:19.912 --> 41:20.390
Zhi!

41:20.434 --> 41:21.348
Zhi!

41:21.391 --> 41:24.090
I think you got some fans.

41:27.006 --> 41:27.485
Zhi!

41:27.528 --> 41:27.963
Zhi!

41:28.007 --> 41:28.486
Zhi!

41:28.529 --> 41:28.964
Zhi!

41:29.008 --> 41:31.924
Zhi!

41:31.967 --> 41:33.969
Hey, slow loris.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.232
Emphasis on the slow.

41:36.276 --> 41:39.888
Care to engage in a classic
raising of the stakes?

41:39.932 --> 41:41.281
What do you have in mind?

41:41.324 --> 41:43.675
If you win, not
only will I give you

41:43.718 --> 41:45.415
the deed to your
house, I'll give you

41:45.459 --> 41:48.723
the deed to the
whole loris village.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.029
What's the catch?

41:50.072 --> 41:55.077
If you lose, you
become my echo.

41:55.121 --> 41:55.600
Hmm?

42:01.606 --> 42:02.084
Deal.

42:05.871 --> 42:06.698
Aw!

42:06.741 --> 42:08.613
Hand buzzer-- classic.

42:27.936 --> 42:28.415
Zhi!

42:28.458 --> 42:28.894
Zhi!

42:28.937 --> 42:29.372
Zhi!

42:29.416 --> 42:29.895
Zhi!

42:39.861 --> 42:40.819
Hmm?

42:48.043 --> 42:49.262
What?

43:17.638 --> 43:20.206
We're talking away.

43:20.249 --> 43:22.774
I don't know what I'm to say.

43:22.817 --> 43:25.298
I'll say it anyway.

43:25.341 --> 43:31.783
Today is another day to
find you shying away.

43:31.826 --> 43:34.742
Oh, I'll be coming
for your love, OK?

43:34.786 --> 43:38.267
Take on me.

43:38.311 --> 43:39.747
Take on me.

43:39.791 --> 43:44.230
Take me on.

43:44.273 --> 43:46.232
Take on me.

43:46.275 --> 43:52.717
I'll be gone in a day or two.

43:56.242 --> 43:58.679
Take on me.

43:58.723 --> 44:01.160
Take me on.

44:01.203 --> 44:03.162
Take on me.

44:03.205 --> 44:05.643
I'll be gone.

44:12.171 --> 44:14.260
See that tree?

44:14.303 --> 44:15.304
Aim for that.

44:15.348 --> 44:16.262
Aim for--

44:22.660 --> 44:23.617
Nice work.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.705
Nice work.

44:24.749 --> 44:26.707
I was talking to the tree.

44:26.751 --> 44:30.276
Congrats, you're no
longer on my list.

44:30.319 --> 44:31.843
You, you're fired.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.235
You're fired.

44:33.279 --> 44:36.586
Take on me.

44:36.630 --> 44:37.892
Take on me.

44:37.936 --> 44:41.069
Take me on.

44:41.113 --> 44:42.505
Take me on.

44:42.549 --> 44:44.159
Well, that was weird.

44:44.203 --> 44:45.726
Well,
you're not wrong.

44:45.770 --> 44:47.946
Unless Zhi has a rope and
a trunkfull of tiny toads,

44:47.989 --> 44:51.253
he might be in some
serious trouble.

44:51.297 --> 44:51.776
Aha!

44:58.130 --> 44:58.652
Hmm?

45:14.973 --> 45:15.756
All right.

45:15.800 --> 45:16.452
We did it, Gnash.

45:16.496 --> 45:17.236
Way to go, kid.

45:17.279 --> 45:18.411
That was awesome.

45:21.806 --> 45:23.329
There you go, little fella.

45:23.372 --> 45:26.462
Little fella?

45:26.506 --> 45:27.420
Come on, Gnash.

45:27.463 --> 45:29.465
We can still take the leg.

45:29.509 --> 45:30.379
Hey!

45:30.423 --> 45:30.902
Mama mia.

45:35.210 --> 45:37.691
Back up gently, gently.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.309
Oh, wait.

45:59.669 --> 46:01.062
My bambini!

46:01.106 --> 46:01.628
Zhi.

46:18.079 --> 46:18.601
I gotcha.

46:25.608 --> 46:27.567
Oh, no.

46:27.610 --> 46:29.308
My bambinos!

46:29.351 --> 46:30.526
Berpe!

46:30.570 --> 46:32.659
Gnash, don't
disconnect that hitch.

46:32.702 --> 46:35.227
We're going to lose
a ton of time, kid.

46:35.270 --> 46:36.750
I know.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.492
But I entered a Silk Road
Rally to save a family.

46:39.535 --> 46:41.799
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

46:44.453 --> 46:45.715
Let's just make it quick, OK?

46:53.071 --> 46:54.942
Do you think this will work?

46:54.986 --> 46:57.466
Not a chance.

46:57.510 --> 46:58.816
I've got you.

46:58.859 --> 46:59.773
Punch it, kid.

46:59.817 --> 47:00.818
Punch it, kid.

47:07.085 --> 47:09.043
Oh, this is
not looking good, folks.

47:09.087 --> 47:12.960
The weight and pressure are
going to rip Zhi's car in two.

47:13.004 --> 47:15.571
Oh,
he'd love two cars.

47:15.615 --> 47:16.442
Come on.

47:16.485 --> 47:17.443
Don't give out on me.

47:22.883 --> 47:24.798
Come on.

47:24.842 --> 47:25.886
Come on!

47:25.930 --> 47:26.800
Oh, no!

47:26.844 --> 47:28.628
Hurry!

47:28.671 --> 47:30.978
Ah, Zhi did it!

47:31.022 --> 47:31.805
We're safe.

47:44.383 --> 47:45.863
It was super scary, guys.

47:50.780 --> 47:54.219
Ooh, yes!

47:54.262 --> 47:55.611
Berpe, Adalina!

47:55.655 --> 47:57.657
I'm so glad you guys are safe.

47:57.700 --> 48:00.703
Thank you so much for saving

48:00.747 --> 48:03.097
my babies and my Berpe.

48:03.141 --> 48:05.186
I don't know what
I'd do without him.

48:08.929 --> 48:11.323
Well, this is truly
a remarkable moment, folks.

48:11.366 --> 48:13.455
And one that I don't think
we'll forget in a hurry.

48:13.499 --> 48:15.109
The moment went on unlikely.

48:15.153 --> 48:19.026
Little loris named Zhi became
the face of this Silk Road

48:19.070 --> 48:19.592
Rally.

48:22.682 --> 48:23.683
Look, Granny Bai, look!

48:23.726 --> 48:24.771
It's Zhi!

48:24.814 --> 48:27.121
He saved all the other racers.

48:27.165 --> 48:30.559
New
face on the Silk Road Rally.

48:30.603 --> 48:34.215
My goodness, look at
what your boy has done.

48:34.259 --> 48:36.391
You must be so proud.

48:36.435 --> 48:37.262
Oh, I am.

48:40.004 --> 48:44.878
But I'm also so
ashamed of myself.

48:44.922 --> 48:51.276
I wasn't ever really helping
him find his Dao, was I?

48:51.319 --> 48:55.019
I was just trying to
force him to accept mine.

48:58.631 --> 49:00.676
So, folks, we
are at the end of day 2.

49:00.720 --> 49:04.202
And what a spectacular
day of racing it has been.

49:04.245 --> 49:06.682
Team Vainglorious nabbed
first place again.

49:06.726 --> 49:08.162
No big surprise there.

49:08.206 --> 49:10.556
But the big story of the
day is Team Muddy Meadows

49:10.599 --> 49:13.689
who has shocked the world
by climbing into third place

49:13.733 --> 49:15.430
after a harrowing rescue.

49:15.474 --> 49:21.001
We are here with fan favorite
and hero of the day, Zhi.

49:21.045 --> 49:23.525
So she we would be
remiss if we didn't

49:23.569 --> 49:26.441
ask you the question that
is on everyone's mind.

49:26.485 --> 49:28.922
If you hit yourself
and it hurts,

49:28.966 --> 49:31.403
does that mean you're
strong or weak?

49:31.446 --> 49:32.665
No.

49:32.708 --> 49:34.319
What were you thinking
when you stopped

49:34.362 --> 49:35.973
in the middle of the race to
rescue all your competitors?

49:36.016 --> 49:37.322
What was going
through your mind?

49:37.365 --> 49:38.149
Talk us through it.

49:38.192 --> 49:39.019
Honestly?

49:39.063 --> 49:40.151
I wasn't thinking.

49:40.194 --> 49:42.022
My friends were in danger.

49:42.066 --> 49:44.285
Besides, I still
have two more days.

49:44.329 --> 49:45.591
Like seriously?

49:45.634 --> 49:47.332
Two more?

49:47.375 --> 49:49.769
Well, Zhi, you definitely came
off looking like a real winner

49:49.812 --> 49:50.596
today.

49:50.639 --> 49:52.337
Thanks.

49:52.380 --> 49:55.949
It's like an old friend told me,
winners are always winning even

49:55.993 --> 49:56.819
when they're losing.

50:11.356 --> 50:12.270
OK.

50:12.313 --> 50:14.098
When I say vain, you say--

50:14.141 --> 50:17.188
When I say vain, you say--

50:17.231 --> 50:18.102
Idiots!

50:18.145 --> 50:19.059
Glorious!

50:19.103 --> 50:20.626
Reply is glorious!

50:20.669 --> 50:21.453
Idiots!

50:21.496 --> 50:22.410
Glorious!

50:22.454 --> 50:24.804
The reply is glorious!

50:24.847 --> 50:27.372
It's ironically hard to
get a good call or response

50:27.415 --> 50:29.852
game with echoes.

50:29.896 --> 50:30.810
Ah!

50:30.853 --> 50:31.376
Daddy!

50:31.419 --> 50:32.290
Daddy!

50:33.552 --> 50:35.206
Imbecile brothers.

50:35.249 --> 50:36.859
Imbecile brothers.

50:36.903 --> 50:40.254
I'm so happy you can join
the festivities in honor of

50:40.298 --> 50:42.952
and sponsored by me.

50:42.996 --> 50:44.693
A brochure?

50:44.737 --> 50:50.786
Archiebold you have risked our
family's business over a bet.

50:50.830 --> 50:51.396
Bet?

50:51.439 --> 50:53.093
What bet?

50:53.137 --> 50:54.877
Oh, that guy.

50:54.921 --> 50:56.618
Don't even, daddy.

50:56.662 --> 50:59.969
He's in third place which is so
many places behind first place.

51:00.013 --> 51:02.363
You couldn't even count
him if you wanted to.

51:02.407 --> 51:09.675
If you lose Muddy Meadows,
you lose everything.

51:09.718 --> 51:11.155
Everything?

51:11.198 --> 51:13.809
Please, daddy, I'm not
as moronic as my brothers.

51:13.853 --> 51:14.636
No offense.

51:14.680 --> 51:15.855
Well, some offense.

51:15.898 --> 51:19.380
I've taken out an
insurance policy.

51:20.207 --> 51:21.687
It's V.

51:21.730 --> 51:22.340
You
don't have to say, It's V,

51:22.383 --> 51:23.776
every time.

51:23.819 --> 51:24.864
Your name shows up on
my phone when you call.

51:24.907 --> 51:26.387
It's how phones work.

51:26.431 --> 51:27.171
Never mind.

51:27.214 --> 51:28.737
What do you want?

51:28.781 --> 51:31.000
Nearly striking out with
the goat so it's up to you.

51:31.044 --> 51:33.046
You want me to
beat up the goat?

51:33.090 --> 51:36.354
No, I want you to
find Zhi's weakness.

51:36.397 --> 51:37.790
Greetings, dance fans.

51:37.833 --> 51:40.401
And welcome to the
Nuorilang Falls Ball.

51:40.445 --> 51:43.274
And what a beautiful
place to be.

51:58.158 --> 51:58.811
Hey.

51:58.854 --> 51:59.681
Muddy Meadows.

51:59.725 --> 52:00.552
You realize--

52:00.595 --> 52:01.379
If you take--

52:01.422 --> 52:02.119
Tomorrow--

52:02.162 --> 52:03.294
By 20 minutes--

52:03.337 --> 52:04.164
You'll only be--

52:04.208 --> 52:04.860
10 minutes--

52:04.904 --> 52:06.210
From the top.

52:06.253 --> 52:08.516
If you can pull that
off, mate, the next day,

52:08.560 --> 52:12.781
you'd have a real
chance at the cup.

52:12.825 --> 52:13.608
Too right.

52:13.652 --> 52:14.566
Touch a nitro.

52:14.609 --> 52:15.610
I hope you seal the deal.

52:15.654 --> 52:17.221
Yeah, that'd be great.

52:17.264 --> 52:20.311
But nitro is a bit outside
our budget which is nothing.

52:24.619 --> 52:26.317
Whoa, seriously?

52:26.360 --> 52:28.014
Thanks.

52:28.057 --> 52:32.497
This could really help us
close that 29-minute gap, kid.

52:32.540 --> 52:33.062
Kid?

52:47.381 --> 52:51.211
So this is what a burgeoning
superstar does in his off time.

52:51.255 --> 52:53.431
I'm no superstar.

52:53.474 --> 52:55.911
Oh, then what are
you doing on my cup?

53:01.134 --> 53:04.093
So last time I
saw you, I believe

53:04.137 --> 53:08.228
you were asking me to dance.

53:08.272 --> 53:09.229
Was I?

53:09.273 --> 53:09.751
Whoa!

53:13.929 --> 53:16.193
Looking good, kid.

53:16.236 --> 53:16.889
OK.

53:25.941 --> 53:27.987
OK, whoa, slow
down there, Speedy.

53:34.036 --> 53:35.081
See?

53:35.124 --> 53:36.387
Isn't that better?

53:36.430 --> 53:36.952
Yeah.

53:45.265 --> 53:46.527
I like the way you dance.

53:46.571 --> 53:48.747
Then you should
probably thank my Granny.

53:48.790 --> 53:51.315
She's the only person
I've ever danced with.

53:51.358 --> 53:54.274
She taught me all my moves.

53:54.318 --> 53:57.973
Well, how do you like it
then dancing with someone else?

53:58.017 --> 53:58.887
I like it.

53:58.931 --> 54:00.062
A lot less elbow skin.

54:23.608 --> 54:24.739
I'm sorry.

54:24.783 --> 54:26.001
I can't.

54:26.045 --> 54:27.481
Not like this.

54:27.525 --> 54:29.527
But wait!

54:29.570 --> 54:31.093
Shelby!

54:31.137 --> 54:31.616
Hey.

54:39.406 --> 54:41.365
Something get
under your warts, V?

54:41.408 --> 54:43.192
Oh, there she is.

54:43.236 --> 54:46.239
Tell me what's the dirt
on my little friend?

54:46.283 --> 54:48.415
You told me you were
getting even with someone

54:48.459 --> 54:50.112
who double crossed you.

54:50.156 --> 54:51.984
You didn't say anything about
hurting an innocent loris

54:52.027 --> 54:53.899
and destroying my
childhood home.

54:53.942 --> 54:55.553
I'm out.

54:55.596 --> 54:58.991
You came to me appealing to
my love of taking advantage

54:59.034 --> 55:00.732
of the helpless in
their times of need

55:00.775 --> 55:03.082
and, in detriment,
my evil whims,

55:03.125 --> 55:06.172
and asked me to have your
father's name cleared

55:06.215 --> 55:08.305
for a crime that I
clearly framed him

55:08.348 --> 55:12.787
for which I did for you and
which, of course, I can undo.

55:12.831 --> 55:17.575
Therefore, when I
say jump, you say--

55:17.618 --> 55:19.533
You say--

55:19.577 --> 55:21.274
How high?

55:21.318 --> 55:22.580
Right.

55:22.623 --> 55:25.800
And when I say side
vegetable, you say--

55:25.844 --> 55:27.280
Stewed carrots?

55:27.324 --> 55:28.803
Ooh, nice one.

55:28.847 --> 55:29.804
And when I say--

55:29.848 --> 55:31.197
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

55:35.419 --> 55:36.333
Bop, bop, bop.

55:42.904 --> 55:47.605
What the-- Shelby
and the Vainglorious?

55:47.648 --> 55:50.956
Oh, no, this is going
to kill the kid.

55:50.999 --> 55:54.655
Well, don't let him find
out until the race is over.

55:54.699 --> 55:59.094
And when I say dream
first date, you say--

55:59.138 --> 56:01.053
Moonlit dance
beside a waterfall

56:01.096 --> 56:03.925
with a sweet guy
who makes me laugh.

56:03.969 --> 56:06.754
I would have also
accepted putting on a show.

56:11.759 --> 56:12.760
Blimey!

56:12.804 --> 56:14.153
How did I don't see it before?

56:14.196 --> 56:16.938
It's so obvious.

56:16.982 --> 56:18.418
See what?

56:18.462 --> 56:20.202
Perhaps if you're
standing where I'm standing

56:20.246 --> 56:22.248
and I'm standing
where you're standing,

56:22.291 --> 56:24.424
you could see what
I clearly see.

56:24.468 --> 56:27.949
Go, stand where I was standing.

56:27.993 --> 56:28.472
Hmm.

56:28.515 --> 56:29.821
Huh?

56:29.864 --> 56:32.519
What exactly am I
supposed to be seeing?

56:32.563 --> 56:33.433
You're right.

56:33.477 --> 56:35.522
It is worse this way.

56:35.566 --> 56:37.916
Go back, go back, go back.

56:37.959 --> 56:38.743
Hmm?

56:38.786 --> 56:39.961
What?

56:40.005 --> 56:41.659
What you are
supposed to be saying

56:41.702 --> 56:45.619
is that you two silly lorises
are falling for each other.

56:45.663 --> 56:48.622
You are the secret
weapon I've been

56:48.666 --> 56:50.276
looking for the whole time.

56:50.319 --> 56:52.713
So wouldn't it just
break his simple heart

56:52.757 --> 56:57.631
to learn that you've been
working for me all along?

56:57.675 --> 56:58.327
Pow!

56:58.371 --> 57:01.113
No.

57:01.156 --> 57:04.333
Welcome race fans to
day 3 of this Silk Road Rally.

57:04.377 --> 57:07.467
Today's course takes us right
through the Stone Forest.

57:07.511 --> 57:09.426
- A
- forest made of stone?

57:09.469 --> 57:10.862
I can't believe this.

57:18.173 --> 57:19.174
Huh?

57:19.218 --> 57:20.480
Oh, Zhi, great, there you are.

57:20.524 --> 57:22.090
In the car, let's go.

57:22.134 --> 57:23.875
I got to hand
it to you, Gnash.

57:23.918 --> 57:26.181
You were totally right
making a stop for Shelby.

57:26.225 --> 57:26.965
She is--

57:27.008 --> 57:28.140
Dead weight, yeah.

57:28.183 --> 57:29.358
I don't know what
I was thinking.

57:29.402 --> 57:32.318
That's not what
I was going to say.

57:33.232 --> 57:34.625
You seem a little jumpy.

57:34.668 --> 57:35.234
Yes?

57:35.277 --> 57:36.017
What?

57:36.061 --> 57:37.062
What do you want?

57:37.105 --> 57:37.758
Here, let me get that for you.

57:37.802 --> 57:38.803
Gnash, what the?

57:38.846 --> 57:40.892
Oh, no, the window is broken.

57:40.935 --> 57:43.895
Uhh--

57:43.938 --> 57:46.245
Shelby doesn't love you.

57:46.288 --> 57:48.203
She works for me.

57:48.247 --> 57:49.466
What's he saying?

57:49.509 --> 57:53.034
She does it long
view rehearse the flea?

57:53.078 --> 57:53.948
Cuckoo, am I right?

58:00.085 --> 58:00.868
Uh-oh.

58:00.912 --> 58:02.783
Hey, Gnash!

58:02.827 --> 58:04.393
What the heck?

58:04.437 --> 58:06.744
These screens are a
serious distraction.

58:06.787 --> 58:07.658
They destroy focus.

58:07.701 --> 58:09.703
You can't have that.

58:09.747 --> 58:11.052
You're welcome.

58:11.096 --> 58:12.837
All racers
to your vehicles.

58:12.880 --> 58:15.535
Oh, yes, finally, here we go.

58:45.217 --> 58:47.175
Last night,
dancing with Shelby,

58:47.219 --> 58:49.351
it was like a dream come true.

58:49.395 --> 58:51.310
But one I never
even knew I wanted.

58:51.353 --> 58:52.398
Ah-ha.

58:52.441 --> 58:53.573
Well, look out.

58:53.617 --> 58:55.575
What if she never comes back?

58:55.619 --> 58:57.316
How could I ever be
happy again knowing

58:57.359 --> 58:58.752
what life could have been?

58:58.796 --> 58:59.666
I couldn't, Gnash.

58:59.710 --> 59:02.364
I just couldn't.

59:02.408 --> 59:05.846
Then again, a winter
wedding would be so Shelby.

59:05.890 --> 59:07.065
But a summer wedding--

59:07.108 --> 59:08.632
Oh, enough already.

59:08.675 --> 59:11.417
You've been talking about
this girl for 1,000 miles.

59:11.460 --> 59:13.854
You need to get your
head back in this race.

59:13.898 --> 59:15.943
How's this for
head in the race?

59:15.987 --> 59:18.555
Whoa, kid, that's
100% pure nitro.

59:18.598 --> 59:21.253
You will just--

59:21.296 --> 59:22.559
Holy moly.

59:25.126 --> 59:30.131
Zhi just took off like a roo
with a rocket in its rump.

59:38.313 --> 59:40.707
After I save
Granny's house, I think

59:40.751 --> 59:42.796
maybe I'll get a
place of my own,

59:42.840 --> 59:45.407
something worthy of
Shelby, you know.

59:45.451 --> 59:47.627
I'm thinking karaoke room.

59:47.671 --> 59:49.020
Oh, for the love of--

59:49.063 --> 59:50.761
Hey, seriously, what
is up with you today?

59:50.804 --> 59:51.283
Who?

59:51.326 --> 59:52.980
Me?

59:53.024 --> 59:54.939
You're the one that wants to
quit yammering on about Shelby

59:54.982 --> 59:56.418
when you should be racing.

59:56.462 --> 59:58.159
You're jealous.

59:58.203 --> 01:00:00.640
Oh, what in the world
would I be jealous of?

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:05.079
Me because it's not the
amazing Gnash show this time.

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:07.212
Oh, give me a
break, wouldn't you?

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:12.870
Team Muddy Meadows
have broken the land speed

01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:14.567
record.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.613
Yeah, they're
definitely going to crash.

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:20.051
Whoa, we're too hot.

01:00:20.094 --> 01:00:21.052
Lay off the nitro.

01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:27.928
Come on!

01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:28.494
Whoa!

01:00:44.771 --> 01:00:45.467
Yes!

01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:46.730
Go, Zhi-zhi, go!

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:51.560
Let's take
another look at that finish.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:52.257
Yes, Speedy!

01:00:59.046 --> 01:01:00.961
You could have killed us.

01:01:01.005 --> 01:01:03.224
Nitro can't handle
that kind of heat.

01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:05.052
You can't handle
that kind of heat.

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:11.276
Your pistons are misfiring, son.

01:01:14.975 --> 01:01:16.716
You are just like your mother.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.196
As soon as you
don't get your way,

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:20.154
you just fly off the handle.

01:01:20.198 --> 01:01:21.765
My mother?

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:31.731
I taught her how to race.

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:34.734
My mother raced cars?

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:38.390
And she was great
too just like you.

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:41.741
But then this one rally,
we were racing as a team.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:45.571
And I signaled to her
to slow down and not

01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:48.487
take the easy pass,
but she couldn't

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:52.447
resist so she blazed by me.

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:58.018
And-- and when she hit
that next turn, she--

01:01:58.062 --> 01:02:00.629
She what, Gnash?

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:04.546
She-- she should
have listened to me.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:08.159
What happened, Gnash?

01:02:08.202 --> 01:02:09.682
I lost my best friend.

01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:23.914
We could have been amazing.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:25.002
Could have been amazing.

01:02:31.095 --> 01:02:32.618
Oh, yeah?

01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:35.839
If I had middle fingers,
you'd all know it right now.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.627
Hey, what's this?

01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:46.414
One, get out of here.

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:47.024
Get away.

01:02:47.067 --> 01:02:47.676
Go on.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.634
Shoo.

01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:50.070
It's all mine--

01:02:50.114 --> 01:02:53.857
the trophy, Muddy Meadows,
totally conditional

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.120
love of my family.

01:02:56.163 --> 01:02:59.819
Echoes, cue the
victory simulation.

01:03:07.653 --> 01:03:09.350
Well, that
was a dramatic end

01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:11.918
to a dramatic day, folks.

01:03:11.962 --> 01:03:14.486
He and Vainglorious somehow now

01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:16.227
both in first place.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.664
And with his car and
his relationship with teammate

01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:22.102
Gnash both up in flames,
there's suddenly no way for Zhi

01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:25.671
to finish the rally,
let alone win it.

01:03:25.714 --> 01:03:26.803
He needs us.

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:37.683
Oh!

01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:38.640
Yeah!

01:03:38.684 --> 01:03:40.120
Haha!

01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.253
Hey, there she is.

01:03:42.296 --> 01:03:43.341
There she is.

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:45.256
Oh, what are you
so happy about?

01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.474
Haven't you heard?

01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:49.521
Zhi is out of the race.

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:50.522
We did it!

01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:53.873
You and me, the two amigos.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.222
I don't want this.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:56.615
Oh, don't be shy.

01:03:56.658 --> 01:03:59.357
Take a pic.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:03:59.879
Shelby?

01:04:02.621 --> 01:04:04.623
Zhi, what are you--

01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:07.931
what are you-- what are you--
what are you doing here?

01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:09.976
I came to make a trade--

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.413
me for the village.

01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:14.372
How noble of you.

01:04:14.415 --> 01:04:19.899
But seeing as your leverage
just blew up-- what?

01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:21.596
Five minutes ago?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.469
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you didn't hear about that yet.

01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:28.516
I think I'll just take
you and the village.

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:34.348
Echo Training Program?

01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.220
Benefits?

01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:37.221
Wait a second.

01:04:37.264 --> 01:04:39.136
Why are you here, Shelby?

01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:41.486
What-- what's going on?

01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:44.793
Well, OK-- so this
is a crazy story.

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:46.708
You'll think this is funny.

01:04:46.752 --> 01:04:50.364
The thing is-- well the--

01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:56.370
Oh, enough with
the dramatic pauses.

01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:59.286
The lady loris works for me.

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:00.113
No, no, wait.

01:05:00.157 --> 01:05:01.114
It's not like that.

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:03.508
I hired her to destroy you.

01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:04.378
How did she do?

01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:12.560
She killed it.

01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:13.083
Speedy.

01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:19.480
Well, that was awkward.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:24.703
Oh, what an
emotional roller coaster

01:05:24.746 --> 01:05:26.487
ride this has been for Zhi.

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:30.230
And now, it looks like
everyone's favorite slow loris

01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:33.320
is in for a dark
night of the soul.

01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:35.888
It feels like a
saxophone moment to me.

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:14.579
Zhi-zhi, where did
you find that car?

01:06:24.763 --> 01:06:27.853
Kid, you're a force of nature.

01:06:27.896 --> 01:06:31.813
That was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:34.294
When will you find your Dao?

01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:14.682
Going
somewhere, Gnash?

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:19.818
Granny Bai,
what are you doing here?

01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:23.517
Making sure the past
doesn't repeat itself.

01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:27.956
You need to help him
finally embrace his Dao.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.656
I think you
should talk to Zhi.

01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:34.398
You owe me this, Gnash.

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:37.053
And you owe it to Zhi.

01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:41.970
But mostly, you
owe it to yourself.

01:07:42.014 --> 01:07:47.019
It wasn't your fault.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.717
It was nice to see
you again, Granny.

01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:52.677
You take care of yourself.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.504
Aw!

01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:55.158
Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw.

01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:57.334
Granny, let go.

01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:58.596
Oh, come on, Granny.

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.517
"Don't be an idiot."

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.214
Well, that's a good one.

01:08:08.258 --> 01:08:11.087
Darn bumper stickers, why do
they have to be so persuasive?

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.000
So persuasive.

01:08:21.619 --> 01:08:23.490
Next race to
start in one hour.

01:08:23.534 --> 01:08:24.056
What?

01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:45.947
The plant just
knows how to grow.

01:09:05.663 --> 01:09:06.272
Zhi!

01:09:06.316 --> 01:09:07.143
Zhi!

01:09:07.186 --> 01:09:08.796
Where have you been?

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.233
Come on, it's Berpe.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.065
Zhi!

01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:18.893
Look at what my Berpe did.

01:09:18.937 --> 01:09:22.201
It was awesome and
a little disgusting.

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:25.987
I swear I have a whole
new respect for men.

01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:28.860
Come and meet the
little tailbiters.

01:09:28.903 --> 01:09:31.384
They're so cute.

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:32.733
Wow.

01:09:32.777 --> 01:09:34.082
Hi.

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:35.432
They're beautiful.

01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:38.304
Everyone, say hi to Uncle Zhi.

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:49.359
Look at him all tuckered out.

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:51.448
I'm so proud of him.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:54.929
But doc says he's in no
condition to finish the rally.

01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:57.845
Well, then, we can watch
the last leg together

01:09:57.889 --> 01:10:00.370
because I'm out too.

01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:01.458
No, Zhi.

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:04.025
This is where our road led us.

01:10:04.069 --> 01:10:06.985
But you, you need to
get back out there

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:09.857
and find out where
your road goes.

01:10:09.901 --> 01:10:11.250
But even if I wanted to--

01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:13.687
Zhi, we are a familia.

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:17.256
I cannot sit here and let
you offer this a hook.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.953
No.

01:10:18.997 --> 01:10:22.653
Familia, we push each other
forward even when we think we

01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:27.571
can't possibly go on, especially
when we think we can't.

01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:29.616
You can do this, Zhi.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.098
We believe in you.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.278
Shelby?

01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:41.411
I'm so sorry.

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:44.022
Everything Vainglorious
said is true.

01:10:44.065 --> 01:10:45.676
When we met, I was
working for him

01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:47.373
but I didn't really
know what I was doing

01:10:47.417 --> 01:10:48.505
or who I was doing it to.

01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:50.333
And then-- and then we met.

01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:52.030
And we got along so well.

01:10:52.073 --> 01:10:55.294
And you-- you were the kid
with the soup pot on your head.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.078
And then I realized
that you were fighting

01:10:57.122 --> 01:11:00.865
for the Loris Village which
meant that I was the one trying

01:11:00.908 --> 01:11:02.823
to destroy it.

01:11:02.867 --> 01:11:04.129
Shelby, I get it.

01:11:04.172 --> 01:11:05.304
You didn't know.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:06.958
No, but that
doesn't make it right.

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:09.439
My whole life, I have been
trying to find my way back

01:11:09.482 --> 01:11:10.091
to the village.

01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:14.835
And when you offered
it to me, I betrayed you.

01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:18.665
But I want to make it right
so that's what I'm doing here.

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:23.322
I'm trying to do right by
the guy I'm sort of into.

01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:25.933
The guy you're sort of into?

01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:30.373
She loves me!

01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:31.504
Did you guys hear that?

01:11:31.548 --> 01:11:34.377
She totally loves me.

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.596
Whoa, slow down there, Speedy.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.599
We still got a race to finish.

01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:41.122
Shelby, I--

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.950
I blew up my car.

01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:45.344
There's no way for me
to finish the race.

01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:49.305
There's-- there's not going
to be a village to go back to.

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:49.827
Unless--

01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:56.355
Isn't this Neil's car?

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:57.530
Not anymore.

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.104
The starting line is
the other direction.

01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:06.931
Oh, I know.

01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:13.111
Hey, wait.

01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:13.633
Gnash.

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:19.378
Zhi?

01:12:19.422 --> 01:12:20.379
Gnash?

01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:21.728
What are you doing here, kid?

01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:26.994
I'm so sorry about
what I said, Gnash.

01:12:27.038 --> 01:12:30.781
You've been nothing but good
to me, and I blew it all up.

01:12:30.824 --> 01:12:32.348
We blew it up.

01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:34.219
I'm sorry too, kid.

01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:37.309
I should have told you
about your mama sooner.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.746
And then when the
road got rough,

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:42.662
I just up and split
without so much as a glance

01:12:42.706 --> 01:12:44.403
in the rearview.

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:46.536
You know, truth is I would
have been on that bus

01:12:46.579 --> 01:12:48.929
there too if an old
friend hadn't stopped by

01:12:48.973 --> 01:12:51.367
to drop some wisdom on me.

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:54.021
An old friend?

01:12:54.065 --> 01:12:55.849
Come
on now, you two.

01:12:55.893 --> 01:12:57.416
I'm not that old.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:57.938
Granny!

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.857
I'm sorry, Zhi-zhi.

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:05.206
I never intended--

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.164
It's OK, Granny.

01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:06.730
It's OK.

01:13:09.472 --> 01:13:11.822
I'm so proud of you.

01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:14.433
You're proud of me?

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:16.130
Even though I'm racing?

01:13:16.174 --> 01:13:19.133
Because you're racing.

01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:22.180
You found your Dao, Zhi, Zhi.

01:13:22.223 --> 01:13:23.747
Now, go save our home.

01:13:26.358 --> 01:13:28.447
I hate to be the one
to break it to you guys,

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:32.016
but I think it might be a
little too late for that.

01:13:32.059 --> 01:13:33.626
Too late?

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:37.021
But you're the one who said,
"Races aren't won or lost

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:39.197
until the final second."

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:39.937
Hmm?

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.199
Yeah.

01:13:41.242 --> 01:13:42.113
Again, that's not
what I sound like.

01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:47.771
Well, race fans,
it's the last day of the rally.

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:50.904
And with Zhi out, the only
question on everyone's mind

01:13:50.948 --> 01:13:52.384
is--

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.646
Why don't croissants
come in any other shapes?

01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:55.039
No, not that.

01:13:55.082 --> 01:13:57.737
Can anyone else left
in this race actually

01:13:57.781 --> 01:14:00.305
beat Archie Vainglorious?

01:14:00.348 --> 01:14:01.480
Of course not.

01:14:04.222 --> 01:14:05.223
Where's Zhi?

01:14:06.616 --> 01:14:09.357
Yeah, he's totes
going to miss the race.

01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:12.491
His village is going
to be destroyed.

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:18.454
We've got to find a
way to buy him some time.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:20.499
Lovely idea, lads.

01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:22.458
All right, you lot,
follow our lead.

01:14:35.122 --> 01:14:35.601
Hm?

01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:39.126
Hmm.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.446
Huh?

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:02.280
Tucks away.

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:09.417
Well, that's just a waste
of perfectly good tea pots.

01:15:15.772 --> 01:15:18.949
Hey, what are you doing?

01:15:18.992 --> 01:15:20.820
7 minutes
in, and the other teams

01:15:20.864 --> 01:15:23.127
have a deadlock on Vainglorious.

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.172
Wow,
this map is really handy.

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:33.441
Oh, we
are four hours now.

01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:36.575
And these guys have no intention
of letting Vainglorious pass.

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:37.968
Four hours?

01:15:38.011 --> 01:15:40.710
It was just 7 minutes
like 12 seconds ago.

01:15:40.753 --> 01:15:41.885
Oh, that's a lot of numbers.

01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:43.451
My head hurts.

01:15:48.848 --> 01:15:50.894
I don't know
what these guys are up to,

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:52.548
but they're up to something.

01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:04.864
They're corralling him.

01:16:04.908 --> 01:16:06.997
Five trapped Vainglorious.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:07.563
Oh.

01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:13.786
Ta-ta!

01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:19.575
Ta-ta!

01:16:19.618 --> 01:16:22.012
And Vainglorious
has broken free.

01:16:22.055 --> 01:16:24.928
Who would've seen that coming?

01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:25.493
Ha!

01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:32.326
Ha-ha!

01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.284
Ahh!

01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:34.764
Huh?

01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:35.721
Ugh!

01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:37.723
Huh?

01:16:46.297 --> 01:16:49.605
Well, folks, it seems like
it's a great day for evil

01:16:49.648 --> 01:16:53.173
everywhere as Archie
Vainglorious has just secured

01:16:53.217 --> 01:16:54.914
himself a certain victory.

01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:00.311
Yey!

01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:01.529
Hang on a second.

01:17:01.573 --> 01:17:02.530
What's this?

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:07.535
Some fool has just
joined the race.

01:17:07.579 --> 01:17:09.755
Is that Neil?

01:17:09.799 --> 01:17:11.191
Oh!

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:12.845
Oh, no way,
that's not some fool.

01:17:12.889 --> 01:17:18.068
It's Muddy Meadows,
the mini miracle!

01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:19.939
Mini miracle?

01:17:19.983 --> 01:17:21.985
Oh, that's a cool nickname.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:36.477
There it is, Shanghai!

01:17:42.222 --> 01:17:45.095
You got this, Speedy.

01:17:45.138 --> 01:17:48.664
If there's ever been
a more exciting race for a cup,

01:17:48.707 --> 01:17:52.102
I, for one, cannot recall it.

01:17:52.145 --> 01:17:53.843
I've got to agree.

01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:55.366
That's because this
is the first race you've ever

01:17:55.409 --> 01:17:56.889
seen, Juni.

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.412
I've got
to agree with you again.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.635
Steady, steady.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.028
Ha-ha!

01:18:05.071 --> 01:18:06.159
As if, loris.

01:18:06.203 --> 01:18:07.857
As if.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.511
I can't get past him.

01:18:10.555 --> 01:18:12.426
Not yet.

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.949
Not yet.

01:18:16.039 --> 01:18:16.561
Now!

01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:25.135
Cheerio!

01:18:25.178 --> 01:18:27.572
Ahh!

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:30.488
Yeah, way to go, kid.

01:18:34.405 --> 01:18:35.275
Hm?

01:18:35.319 --> 01:18:36.363
Uh-- right--

01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:38.278
left-- right?

01:18:38.322 --> 01:18:39.366
Hold on.

01:18:41.455 --> 01:18:43.370
Whoa!

01:18:43.414 --> 01:18:44.371
Uh--

01:18:44.415 --> 01:18:46.809
Speedy!

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:47.374
Ahh!

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:53.772
Dang it!

01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:03.216
Hm?

01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:10.180
Ahhh!

01:19:10.223 --> 01:19:11.355
Back up, back up!

01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:12.704
You can get around
him and take it.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:13.923
Coming down, look out!

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:15.489
You're not going
to make it through!

01:19:19.102 --> 01:19:19.929
Forward, Zhi!

01:19:19.972 --> 01:19:21.321
Forward fast, forward!

01:19:26.196 --> 01:19:29.939
Oh, Vainglorious
has pulled ahead yet again.

01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:32.898
And this time, it looks
like it's curtains for Zhi.

01:19:34.508 --> 01:19:36.075
What are we going to do?

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:37.076
Gnash?

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.599
I'm sorry.

01:19:38.643 --> 01:19:40.558
I'm all out of bumper stickers.

01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:41.777
Speedy?

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.779
Hmm?

01:19:59.272 --> 01:20:00.447
Go save our home.

01:20:05.409 --> 01:20:08.891
What exactly is going through
that giant head of yours right

01:20:08.934 --> 01:20:10.501
now, kid?

01:20:10.544 --> 01:20:14.374
Like you said, when I'm
behind, I'm a force of nature.

01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:20.554
Oh, stiffen the
wombat and thump the lizard.

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:23.644
The mini miracle is headed
straight into a colossal death

01:20:23.688 --> 01:20:25.168
spiral.

01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:26.517
It sounds
like a very stupid idea.

01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:44.665
This is crazy.

01:21:20.397 --> 01:21:22.616
The cup is mine!

01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:27.491
No!

01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:37.936
Well, vanquish me
Vegemite and call me a koala.

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.764
You are a koala.

01:21:39.807 --> 01:21:43.028
The mini miracle
has just won the first

01:21:43.072 --> 01:21:46.118
ever Silk Road Race!

01:21:47.859 --> 01:21:48.686
We did it!

01:21:55.127 --> 01:21:55.649
Hey.

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:00.828
I'm his friend!

01:22:00.872 --> 01:22:01.351
Go, Zhi!

01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:29.640
Zhi, can I have
your autograph please?

01:22:29.683 --> 01:22:32.121
That was great.

01:22:32.164 --> 01:22:33.600
Hey, you did it.

01:22:33.644 --> 01:22:36.081
What's up, Zhi?

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:39.476
Hey, it's supposed to
say the Amazing Gnash.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.220
Fired!

01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:44.916
Fired!

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.438
Fired.

01:22:45.482 --> 01:22:46.222
Fired.

01:22:46.265 --> 01:22:46.787
Fired.

01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:47.310
Fired.

01:22:47.353 --> 01:22:47.875
Fired.

01:22:47.919 --> 01:22:48.702
Fired.

01:22:48.746 --> 01:22:50.356
Fired.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.010
Hey, Vainglorious.

01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:54.926
Ready to settle that bet?

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.711
I'm sorry what bet was that?

01:22:59.017 --> 01:23:00.801
We got you, Zhi.

01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:01.324
Hmm?

01:23:07.852 --> 01:23:11.899
We had-- someone must
have hacked my account.

01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:15.642
Daddy, you appeared to
have accidentally nabbed me

01:23:15.686 --> 01:23:17.122
with your giant claw device.

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:23.302
Yes.

01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:23.868
Look.

01:23:29.265 --> 01:23:30.222
We did it!

01:23:30.266 --> 01:23:31.745
Let me think.

01:23:31.789 --> 01:23:33.269
I never really liked that
neighborhood anyway--

01:23:33.312 --> 01:23:35.445
too many lorises-- sees?

01:23:35.488 --> 01:23:36.707
Lorisees?

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:37.664
Lorises.

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:38.404
Lorisi?

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:40.798
Aw.

01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:42.756
I'm really going
to miss that guy.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:43.496
Really?

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.019
No.

01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:00.209
OK.

01:24:00.252 --> 01:24:01.384
Yay, Granny.

01:24:01.427 --> 01:24:02.341
Go, Granny.

01:24:02.385 --> 01:24:03.342
Go, Granny.

01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:04.300
Oh, yeah.

01:24:04.343 --> 01:24:05.692
Oh, yeah.

01:24:05.736 --> 01:24:06.215
Hey.

01:24:14.788 --> 01:24:18.618
You know I seem to recall
we've been here before.

01:24:18.662 --> 01:24:21.186
Or was it here?

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:25.103
Actually, I think
I was more like here.

01:24:25.147 --> 01:24:26.800
Oh, that's right.

01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:31.457
Hmm, I can't remember
what happened next.

01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:32.328
Not this.

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:38.725
Zhi-zhi, Shelby, are
we going to play or not?

01:24:42.425 --> 01:24:43.817
Whoa.

01:24:43.861 --> 01:24:46.037
I don't know why
I call you, Speedy.

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:46.559
Hmm?

01:24:59.006 --> 01:25:01.052
Yellow mountain fruit peak?

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.620
I know it was
always your favorite.

01:25:03.663 --> 01:25:04.360
Your favorite?

01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:09.626
I'm still getting
used to that.

01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:11.149
All right, game on.

01:25:11.193 --> 01:25:14.152
OK, but Shelby has to take
it easy on me this time.

01:25:14.196 --> 01:25:15.327
Not a chance.

01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:16.633
I've been learning
from the best.

01:25:16.676 --> 01:25:18.983
Thank you.

01:25:19.026 --> 01:25:21.159
Wait, I've lived
with her all my life.

01:25:21.203 --> 01:25:23.118
How come I never learn
to play like this?

01:25:23.161 --> 01:25:25.642
Because you actually
have to listen.

01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:31.300
Oh, and as the sun
sets over this happily restored

01:25:31.343 --> 01:25:35.042
Slow Loris community, there's
only one thing left to say.

01:25:35.086 --> 01:25:37.306
This story
is a lot like that turtle

01:25:37.349 --> 01:25:38.263
and the rabbit one.

01:25:38.307 --> 01:25:39.525
No, that's--

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:41.048
forget it.

01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:44.356
I get
to be in the sequel, yeah?

01:25:45.227 --> 01:25:46.141
OK, OK.

01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:49.231
I got a rhythm in my body.

01:25:49.274 --> 01:25:50.275
No way, no way.

01:25:50.319 --> 01:25:53.626
Nobody's going to stop me now.

01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:54.888
Today, today.

01:25:54.932 --> 01:25:56.760
I'm going to hold
onto the feeling,

01:25:56.803 --> 01:26:00.111
not going to worry
about the reasons.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.157
No.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.378
The song is getting started
to the beating of my heart.

01:26:06.422 --> 01:26:11.340
And it's getting
me carried away.

01:26:11.383 --> 01:26:13.342
I got the feeling,
feeling right now.

01:26:13.385 --> 01:26:15.866
Keeping it moving,
and I'm making a part.

01:26:19.348 --> 01:26:20.566
Hey!

01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:22.786
This is electric,
electric in there.

01:26:22.829 --> 01:26:25.789
Back in the rhythm and
I ain't going to stop.

01:26:37.235 --> 01:26:38.758
OK, OK.

01:26:38.802 --> 01:26:42.197
Walking on the air like magic.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.459
No way, no way.

01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:46.157
I ain't going to let
them drag me down.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.506
Today, today.

01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:49.204
I'm going to hold
onto that feeling.

01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:53.251
I've been awaken
from my dreaming.

01:26:53.295 --> 01:26:55.210
Oh.

01:26:55.253 --> 01:26:59.431
Something is getting started,
the beating of a heart.

01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:03.696
It's getting me carried away.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.221
I got the feeling,
feeling right now.

01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:08.701
Keeping it moving,
and I'm making a part.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.402
Hey!

01:27:13.445 --> 01:27:15.142
This is electric,
electric in there.

01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:17.667
Back in the room, and
I ain't going to stop.

01:27:40.037 --> 01:27:43.519
Something getting started.

01:27:43.562 --> 01:27:45.390
There's something
getting started--

01:27:47.958 --> 01:27:54.660
the beating of a heart,
the beating, the beating,

01:27:54.704 --> 01:27:56.836
the beating of a heart.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.971
Something getting started.

01:28:01.014 --> 01:28:05.454
There's something
getting started--

01:28:05.497 --> 01:28:12.417
the beating of a heart,
the beating, the beating,

01:28:12.461 --> 01:28:14.419
the beating of a heart.

01:28:14.463 --> 01:28:16.943
I got the feeling,
feeling right now.

01:28:16.987 --> 01:28:19.163
Keeping it moving,
and I'm making a part.

01:28:23.036 --> 01:28:24.255
Hey!

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.648
This is electric,
electric in there.

01:28:25.691 --> 01:28:27.737
Back in the room, and
I ain't going to stop.
