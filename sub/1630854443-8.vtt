00:14.264 --> 00:16.307
[Wind blowing]

00:17.684 --> 00:18.810
- Hey.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.062
Yeah, I understand
the terms of the deal.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.315
We moved too slow,
I guess.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.192
I mean, I had to
jump on it fast.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.445
But, as you recall, your boss
wanted to vet the situation

00:28.486 --> 00:30.822
a little longer, and the product
was snapped up by another party.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.286
All right, you said...

00:36.327 --> 00:38.246
You said no interest
for the first two months

00:38.288 --> 00:40.498
and then 20 to 33 percent
of the loan,

00:40.540 --> 00:41.791
but it hasn't been two months.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.545
What do you mean
when you say

00:45.587 --> 00:46.713
it's out of your hands?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.215
No, I understand
you have given me

00:49.257 --> 00:51.468
chance after chance.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.470
Yeah, I know. I know
it's a lot of money.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.638
I know people get killed
for less.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.689
Yeah. Of course
I'm not gonna run.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.816
I'm a businessman.
Besides, you took my passport,

01:06.858 --> 01:08.234
so even if I wanted to,

01:08.276 --> 01:08.777
-which I don't-

01:08.818 --> 01:09.861
I can't.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.907
Yeah, well,
I'm putting a plan together.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.617
I have several irons
in the fire.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.869
Yes, sir.
I appreciate it.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.173
Maru, wake up.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.299
- Hm?

01:31.341 --> 01:33.259
Max: We gotta go.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.511
- Go where?

01:34.552 --> 01:36.262
Max: Dinner with Alba Fontana,
for my project.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.305
Did you forget?

01:38.973 --> 01:43.812
- No. I, uh, I just.
thought it was later.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.522
- You slept for three hours.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.649
- No, I didn't.
Did I?

01:47.691 --> 01:48.608
- Yeah.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.818
- Why didn't you wake me?

01:49.859 --> 01:52.445
- I'm waking you now.
Let's go.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.446
- I have to shower.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.781
- No, there's no time,
let's go.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.949
And I have a meeting at nine

01:55.990 --> 01:57.325
so we're not gonna
be there long.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.493
- Who are you meeting with?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.286
- What is the point
of always asking me

02:00.328 --> 02:02.288
when you don't understand the
first thing about my business?

02:02.330 --> 02:04.958
- God. It's an innocent
question, it's not a crime.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.751
[Phone vibrating]
- Yeah, well,

02:06.793 --> 02:07.794
lately you've
developed this terrible habit

02:07.836 --> 02:09.087
of asking questions
all the time.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.423
[Phone vibrating]
- It's irritating. Let's go.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.675
[Door opens]

02:13.717 --> 02:15.510
Hey! Hey, Roberto.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.181
Yeah.
Yeah, we spoke.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.976
Well, I assured him
I have a few plans

02:23.018 --> 02:24.477
I'm putting into motion.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.315
What do you mean, how?

02:29.357 --> 02:30.984
Because the shipment
was bigger

02:31.026 --> 02:32.527
than I was first
led to believe.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.195
And I was told
in no uncertain terms,

02:34.237 --> 02:36.197
I had to step up
or lose the chance

02:36.239 --> 02:39.993
to do business with them
in the future.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.912
Well, I told him I can't
pay back the interest.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.582
I can only pay back the loan.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.459
Yeah, he did.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.919
I played it off as a joke
and he said

02:49.961 --> 02:52.922
live by the black market,
die by the black market.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.508
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.346
[Snorting]

02:59.387 --> 03:04.893
Yeah. Yeah, I'm laughing.
It's hilarious. Yeah.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.689
No, they beat Darrell
with a baseball bat, man.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.941
No, he won't be able to walk
right for a year.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.695
His back is completely fucked.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.365
Yeah. He can't even
stand up vertical.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.657
You know,
they took my passport

03:19.699 --> 03:21.368
because they think
I'm gonna flee the country.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.870
[Sniffles]
Yeah. All right.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.373
See you tonight.
Okay.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.832
[Door opens]

03:30.543 --> 03:31.795
You gonna wear that?

03:31.836 --> 03:33.755
- I thought
you liked this dress.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.632
- Looks cheap.
Wear something else.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.342
- Did I do something
to upset you?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.678
- You mind if we fight
in the car? We're very late.

03:39.719 --> 03:40.929
- I don't want to fight at all.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.263
[Phone vibrating]
- Yeah, me either.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.765
So the quicker you change,
the quicker we can go.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.726
Hey. Yeah.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.687
Yeah, of course. Of course,
I was gonna pick up.

03:50.438 --> 03:54.275
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.696
Don't fuck around.
We have a deal.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.531
Of course.
Of course, I can handle it.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.574
Look, there isn't anyone
better than me to run this.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.576
And they know that.
And you know that.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.415
Because the stages
and the trucks

04:08.456 --> 04:09.958
are the perfect cover
to move the coke.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.502
Now I can't be
any cleaner than that.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.298
Yes, yeah. That's the gravy.
Like it's a totally legit front.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.551
Like, for example, I'm having
dinner with Alba Fontana tonight

04:19.592 --> 04:22.012
to go over the details
of the doc with her.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.888
I mean, yeah, in principle,

04:23.930 --> 04:25.807
but, you know she's got
a few minor questions,

04:25.849 --> 04:28.685
but we're gonna hash it out
over dinner.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.687
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?

04:30.729 --> 04:32.689
Did you see the one
where the guy got convicted

04:32.731 --> 04:35.442
because of what came out
during the making of the series?

04:35.483 --> 04:36.735
Okay, it's just...
it's just one idea

04:36.776 --> 04:38.445
but it's very much
in the works.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.614
Like, it's very much
in the works.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.825
How about because you are
an attorney, Roberto,

04:43.867 --> 04:45.618
because you are
obligated to proceed

04:45.660 --> 04:48.913
according to rule of law.
Now, tell them that.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.081
Not agreed!

04:52.876 --> 04:55.962
All right. I'll see you
at nine o'clock.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.007
[Panting]

04:59.758 --> 05:01.009
Not agreed.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.428
[Sniffing line of coke]

05:08.892 --> 05:10.560
What have I told you
about eavesdropping?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.145
- I wasn't. - Well,
you just happened

05:12.187 --> 05:14.439
to be standing real close
to the door because why?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.858
- I just wanted to see
if this dress was any better,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.068
but you were on the phone.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.903
Max: You really are dumb
as a fucking stump

05:19.944 --> 05:21.488
if you think
I'm gonna buy that.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.490
- Wow, someone is in a mood.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.159
- It must be nice to be
able to fix any old problem

05:26.201 --> 05:28.036
by spreading your legs.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.829
- Why are you
being rude to me?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.748
- Oh, I'm being a rude?
- So rude.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.999
- Oh, well pardon me,
madmoi-fuckin-selle.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.751
The world must look
so different to you.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.002
- What's that got to do
with anything?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.754
- You know, people aren't
afraid of death

05:37.796 --> 05:39.005
because deep down,
we all know it's coming.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.215
But pain?

05:40.256 --> 05:41.633
Now that is
a different matter altogether.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.177
We spend our whole lives
trying to avoid it.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.971
I mean, what is life
but the daily avoidance of pain?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.640
[Whispers] - What are we
talking about?

05:48.682 --> 05:49.766
- Pain.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.184
What part of that
is confusing to you?

05:51.226 --> 05:53.144
You know, maybe pain
doesn't apply to you.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.938
Because you can just shake
your needy little ass

05:54.979 --> 05:56.856
and do a dance
and splay yourself on a bed

05:56.898 --> 05:59.192
and make problems vanish
like a fucking magician!

05:59.234 --> 06:00.527
- You love it when I dance.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.861
- Love is a little strong.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.114
You have an eight-year-old's
sense of rhythm.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.783
- Explain this to me:
how can you be inside me

06:06.825 --> 06:08.201
all considerate and manly,

06:08.243 --> 06:10.870
and in a flat second
morph into this angry baby?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.580
It's like the opposite
of a superpower.

06:16.126 --> 06:21.131
- Babe, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.925
It's work,
I'm a little stressed.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.677
That dress is cute.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.556
Come on. Let's go.
We're late.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.141
I'm done.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.934
Hey, try not to
get drunk tonight.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.811
I gotta close this deal.

Those floors are harder
than they look.

out of here before...

- What are you doing?

[Water runs then stops]

going and getting help

10:24.165 --> 10:26.042
and coming back
makes more sense.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.919
- What? How?
- [Muffled disagreement]

10:27.961 --> 10:29.254
- Well, if they see
that we're all gone

10:29.295 --> 10:30.755
when the guys get here
to collect,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.882
they'll think it's a trap
and all hell might break loose.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.551
Now I couldn't live with
all that blood on my hands.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.802
I'm gonna go get help.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.929
- Get what help?
Just untie us.

10:42.267 --> 10:46.563
- I'll untie you
if you tell me off the record

10:46.604 --> 10:48.189
the truth about Archie's death.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.941
I'll never tell another soul.

- I'm sorry. I had to ask.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.377
It's been my life's ambition
to uncover a murder plot.

11:09.419 --> 11:13.798
Especially the mastermind
of a perfect murder.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.802

are so impulsive.

to do with it.

- I poisoned him,
just the way you thought.

so I set you free.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.487
- Exactly right.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.447
- What kind of poison?

11:37.489 --> 11:38.990
- Tetrodotoxin.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.034
I got it from
an old fish vendor I knew

11:41.076 --> 11:42.535
from Maya's Seafood Kitchen
who specialized in fugu.

11:42.577 --> 11:43.870
- Don't tell him anything!

11:43.912 --> 11:46.289
- Alba has nothing to do
with this so set her free.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.208
I put the tetrodotoxin
in his Negroni.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.585
He collapsed, and I dragged him
to the beach in a wheelbarrow

11:50.627 --> 11:53.296
where I set him face down
on the water to finish him off.

The powder she put
in his drink

12:11.147 --> 12:13.149
was not blowfish poison
but guaco.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.234
- What is that?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.652
- A medicinal herb
from Venezuela,

12:15.694 --> 12:17.904
good for chronic cough
and respiratory ailments,

12:17.946 --> 12:19.531
which Don Archibaldo
suffered from.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.657
- How would you know?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.367
- Because I switched out
the poison

12:22.409 --> 12:25.495
Batty kept in a small jar
in her lingerie drawer myself.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.250
Max: How do I know
you're not lying?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.335
- Because I loved him.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.129
A long time ago,
not in the end.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.507
He was a horrible man;
racist, controlling,

12:37.549 --> 12:38.925
and he had a bad back

12:38.967 --> 12:40.385
like the American president
John F. Kennedy,

12:40.427 --> 12:42.345
which undermined
his performance in bed.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.140
But I couldn't let him
die like that.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.267
Go ask the coroner
if he had any traces

12:47.308 --> 12:50.061
of tetrodotoxin in his body
and the answer will be no.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.355
Don Archibaldo died
from a heart attack.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.898

to murder him?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.400
If you hadn't intervened...

12:55.442 --> 12:57.068
Inocencia: She gave him a
small dose one day that gave him

12:57.110 --> 12:59.904
bad gas and diarrhea,
but that was the extent of it.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.324

repeat all this on camera?

13:03.366 --> 13:06.036

on camera, Inocencia!

for this interview.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.085
- Ten thousand dollars,
for starters. Easy.

Alba, where's your camera
and all your gear?

13:26.598 --> 13:27.807

but that's okay.

a camera and a tripod

professional advice?

You'll look like the kidnapper.

murdered my father,
