[Hopper]
<i>So what are we doing here?</i>

01:28.587 --> 01:30.087
<i>Well, my grandfather
used to tell me,</i>

01:30.089 --> 01:31.888
<i>the future can give you
anything you want.</i>

01:31.890 --> 01:33.590
Come on. What are you doing?

01:33.592 --> 01:35.226
What are you doing?

01:35.228 --> 01:38.795
[Hopper] <i>If we wait long enough,
the future will create it.</i>

01:38.797 --> 01:40.031
[dog barks]

01:40.033 --> 01:41.798
[Hopper]
<i>Maybe through technology,</i>

01:41.800 --> 01:44.136
<i>or maybe just from making you
not want it anymore.</i>

01:45.672 --> 01:48.342
<i>Either way, the answer
is in the future.</i>

You wanna go back

02:02.621 --> 02:03.622
Yeah.

Hello...

[ominous music]

03:14.928 --> 03:16.029
Boss, let's go.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.630
[Hopper] Jackie.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.298
- Professor Hopper here.
- [Jackie] <i>Hey!</i>

03:21.300 --> 03:22.166
<i>You didn't get shot
by any hunters. Awesome.</i>

03:22.168 --> 03:24.267
[Hopper] So I found the van.

03:24.269 --> 03:25.702
No sign of the hippies. Uh...

03:25.704 --> 03:27.271
Listen, I need you to put
a climbing pack together for me.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.974
- [Jackie] <i>Oh, really?</i>
- But you can't tell Taylor.

03:29.976 --> 03:31.642
[Hopper] If he finds out
I'm doing an expedition

03:31.644 --> 03:33.344
without him, he'll get upset.

03:33.346 --> 03:34.644
It's better this way.

03:34.646 --> 03:36.814
[Jackie] <i>Do you want her
to have, like,</i>

03:36.816 --> 03:39.049
10,000 of your babies?

03:39.051 --> 03:40.718
[Taylor] It's like you're 13.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.986
- Yeah.
- Just shut your mouth.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.854
You shut your mouth...

03:43.856 --> 03:47.591
Tay-Tay. Best friend, buddy.

03:47.593 --> 03:48.759
- Pal...
- [car rumbles]

03:48.761 --> 03:50.727
[Hopper] Oh, hi, Jackie.

03:50.729 --> 03:52.662
And... Taylor.

03:52.664 --> 03:53.964
Did he really say
not to tell me?

03:53.966 --> 03:55.465
Mm-hmm.

03:55.467 --> 03:56.534
[Hopper] Hey, the whole point
of the favor was discretion.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.868
- Come on, Boss. Come on.
- Here, Boss.

03:58.870 --> 04:00.203
Sorry.

04:00.205 --> 04:02.974
I had a teeny-tiny car issue
so Taylor had to drive.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.308
Besides, he wanted to help.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.509
So you saw it?

04:05.511 --> 04:08.812
[Taylor] You saw the van?
When do we go?

04:08.814 --> 04:11.615
I appreciate you setting
this up on such short notice...

04:11.617 --> 04:13.718
- [Jackie] No problemo.
- I appreciate your offer.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.953
Taylor did all the hard work.

04:14.955 --> 04:18.788
[Hopper] Situation's changed.
I'm going alone.

04:18.790 --> 04:20.322
- [Jackie] All righty.
- Who's gonna watch your back?

04:20.325 --> 04:21.625
Boss, of course.

04:21.628 --> 04:22.794
I'm serious.

04:22.796 --> 04:23.994
Nobody's been on this land
in decades.

04:23.996 --> 04:25.028
You guys don't have anything
to worry about.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.665
- It's gonna be fine.
- Perfect.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.035
Then we'll be back
in no time, right?

04:29.902 --> 04:31.367
I'm going alone.

04:31.369 --> 04:34.939
You guys will be fine without me
for a couple of days. Okay?

04:34.941 --> 04:36.273
If you're worried
about your evaluations,

04:36.275 --> 04:39.143
which you should be,
they've already been submitted.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.645
And they're glowing.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.980
If you can believe that.
Even yours.

04:42.982 --> 04:44.917
Oh, look! Twinsies.

04:46.785 --> 04:48.419
[grunting]
Okay, great. Thanks.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.920
Gotta get up early.

04:49.922 --> 04:50.987
You really think
you're gonna find them?

04:50.989 --> 04:52.922
Maybe.
But if I really get lucky,

04:52.924 --> 04:54.960
I might just find
what they were looking for.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.563
[Hopper] Come on, Boss.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.103

[Hopper grunts]

[Boss whining]

05:18.818 --> 05:20.117
It's not plan A.

05:20.119 --> 05:21.655
It's just in case.

05:22.922 --> 05:23.957
[panting]

05:25.058 --> 05:27.023

God, you're such a worrywart.

- Come on, Jackie!
- [thumping]

06:59.919 --> 07:01.852
[Jackie] Uh, hi, good morning.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.052
[Taylor] We still have to go.

07:03.054 --> 07:03.787
Even if we have to get
a ride to the gate

07:03.789 --> 07:04.888
and hike for a few days.

07:04.890 --> 07:07.391
No. We are not hiking
for a few days.

07:07.393 --> 07:09.559
There's no signal within, like,
a hundred miles of that place.

07:09.561 --> 07:11.996
How would anybody know
when to pick us up?

07:11.998 --> 07:13.064
You've gotta know somebody

07:13.066 --> 07:14.999
who would let us borrow
their truck.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.066
Somebody...

07:16.068 --> 07:17.501
- Anybody...
- What are you doing

07:17.503 --> 07:18.768
- with my phone?
- Nope.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.270
- I'm not calling her.
- Name one other person

07:20.272 --> 07:22.540
who has an off-road vehicle
who would bend over backwards

07:22.542 --> 07:24.208
for you at 6 a.m.
on a Saturday morning.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.809
And it's not her vehicle.

07:25.811 --> 07:27.177
It's her dad's jeep.

07:27.179 --> 07:29.112
And there's no way that
she's gonna loan it out to us.

07:29.114 --> 07:30.181
We'll just rent a truck,
it's fine.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.081
- No. We don't have enough time.
- No.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.217
- Cara?
- Hang up the...

07:33.219 --> 07:34.417
Hey, this is Jackie,

07:34.419 --> 07:35.485
Taylor's friend
from the archeology program.

07:35.487 --> 07:36.586
[Taylor whispering]
Say goodbye.

07:36.588 --> 07:40.057
I am great,
thank you for asking.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.992
Look, Taylor has something
he wants to ask you about.

07:42.994 --> 07:44.160
[mouthing]
Come on. Take it.

07:44.162 --> 07:47.066
[Taylor grunts]
Sorry, did we wake you up?

07:49.301 --> 07:52.235
- You're doing what?
- [Jackie] What?

07:52.237 --> 07:53.838
[whispering]
What is she doing?

07:53.840 --> 07:55.006
[Taylor]
What if I had another option

07:55.008 --> 07:56.206
for you that was
a little more adventurous,

07:56.208 --> 07:57.508
that would definitely
give Veeves an A?

07:57.510 --> 07:59.609
The only thing is,
you really need to bring by

07:59.611 --> 08:01.011
your dad's sweet-ass
four by four.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.112
- Awesome.
- [squeals]

08:02.114 --> 08:03.480
I'll text you
Jackie's address and...

08:03.482 --> 08:06.119
come by like, ASAP,
and we'll explain on the way.

08:08.186 --> 08:09.252
Veeves...

08:09.254 --> 08:10.987
[Taylor]
Mm-hmm. Cara's half-sister.

08:10.989 --> 08:12.088
Actually, how are you with kids?

08:12.090 --> 08:13.924
Uh... awesome.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.292
- [clattering]
- Okay, so I'm gonna leave

08:15.294 --> 08:19.028
this disclaimer here,
just in case I get a bad grade.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.598
Cara's hijacking
my school project

08:20.600 --> 08:22.198
to help out a guy she likes.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.001
But there's a catch.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.401
Dad just made her take
a refresher course

08:25.403 --> 08:27.003
on how to drive stick.

08:27.005 --> 08:28.338
Let's see how that went.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.140
Okay, Dad. I got it, I got it.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.641
- I got it.
- Honey,

08:31.643 --> 08:35.645
treat a manual transmission
like you would a relationship.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.048
You gotta give a little
to get a little.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.082
- Find the balance.
- [snickers]

08:40.085 --> 08:41.051
Dad...

08:41.053 --> 08:43.187
- What?
- He's just a friend.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.155
Okay? And I really don't need
your relationship advice,

08:46.157 --> 08:48.157
- but thank you.
- But he was a four-sport

08:48.159 --> 08:50.160
letterman in high school.
He plays Rugby!

08:50.162 --> 08:51.294
Do you want me
to give him your number?

08:51.296 --> 08:52.362
'Cause it sounds like
you like him.

08:52.364 --> 08:54.098
Now, would I let you
borrow the jeep

08:54.100 --> 08:56.165
if I didn't like the guy?

08:56.167 --> 08:58.902
Our purpose in recording this
is to show problem-solving

08:58.904 --> 09:00.971
through adverse
and unfamiliar situations.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.306
[Veeves] So, what is our adverse
and unfamiliar situation?

09:03.308 --> 09:06.343
Well, Jackie and I,
we're teaching assistants

09:06.345 --> 09:07.410
for this really great guy

09:07.412 --> 09:09.313
in this semester
named Professor Hopper.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.048
<i>And, uh... he's been obsessed</i>

09:11.050 --> 09:12.683
with finding these hippies
that went missing

09:12.685 --> 09:14.285
- back in the '70s.
- Mm-hmm.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.120
<i>They were tripping shrooms
or something,</i>

09:16.122 --> 09:18.722
<i>and they went off looking
for the Fountain of Youth...</i>

09:18.724 --> 09:19.622
- [Veeves] What?
- <i>And they never came home.</i>

09:19.624 --> 09:20.723
The Fountain of Youth? Really?

09:20.725 --> 09:22.425
[Taylor]
Look, I'm not asking you guys

09:22.427 --> 09:23.626
to get your hands muddy.

09:23.628 --> 09:24.727
You can stay in the car
when we get there, okay?

09:24.729 --> 09:25.929
Yeah, all right.
Well, when you told me

09:25.931 --> 09:27.964
that you got a plan
to get Veeves an A,

09:27.966 --> 09:28.832
you really
should have elaborated.

09:28.834 --> 09:29.934
Wait, we forgot about Furby.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.935
- [Jackie] Furby?
- Mm. Is it imperative

09:31.937 --> 09:33.069
that he come?

09:33.071 --> 09:34.170
I don't... He just...

09:34.172 --> 09:36.006
He smells weird
and he always has that

09:36.008 --> 09:38.041
cheese puff crust
on his fingernails.

09:38.043 --> 09:39.109
If Wallace is away
from his mother too long,

09:39.111 --> 09:41.411
he gets what we call
"anxiety-rhea."

09:41.413 --> 09:43.948
- [Furby] Mom!
- But he has pills for that.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.149
[Furby's mom] Do you have
the house phone?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.516
I won't be here.
But, you know, just in case.

09:46.518 --> 09:47.718
[Taylor] Great. Um...
we'll have him home by tonight.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.920
- [Furby's mom] No booze?
- [Taylor] No, ma'am.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.121
- [Furby's mom] No drugs?
- [Taylor] No, ma'am.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.056
[Furby's mom] No girls?
Absolutely no girls.

09:53.058 --> 09:54.357
I know he's at
that age because...

09:54.359 --> 09:56.359
I walked in on him
the other day, in his room,

09:56.361 --> 09:58.094
without knocking
and you can imagine

09:58.096 --> 09:59.429
- what he's doing.
- [Taylor laughs]

09:59.431 --> 10:00.631
- [Taylor] Yeah, I promise you...
- [Jackie] Let's go.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.665
Let's get in it.
Let's get out of here and...

10:02.667 --> 10:03.766
- Perfect.
- Don't do that.

10:03.768 --> 10:05.669
- I love you, Wallace!
- [Jackie] Okay.

10:05.671 --> 10:06.940
[Furby] Love you, Mom.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.441
[foreboding music]

10:16.148 --> 10:17.381
[Furby] <i>You can clip the cameras
to your bags</i>

10:17.383 --> 10:19.049
<i>to keep your hands free.</i>

10:19.051 --> 10:21.084
Here you go.
They're Wi-Fi ready.

10:21.086 --> 10:23.053
Password is... "fart party."

10:23.055 --> 10:24.357
- [Veeves] What?
- [Jackie chuckles]

10:25.324 --> 10:28.025
And one for you, my love.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.392
[Furby] Mm-mm,
you gotta earn it.

10:29.394 --> 10:30.426
- [thumps]
- [Furby] Ow!

10:30.428 --> 10:32.295
[Veeves laughs]

10:32.297 --> 10:33.563
[Cara] <i>All right, so who wants
to give Furby the rundown?</i>

10:33.565 --> 10:35.933
[Furby]
<i>I don't need an explanation.</i>

10:35.935 --> 10:37.467
<i>That's how big
my love is for you.</i>

10:37.469 --> 10:39.102
- [Taylor] <i>Come on, man.</i>
- [Jackie] <i>Thank you, fart party.</i>

10:39.104 --> 10:42.006
[Jackie] <i>We are going
to find the Fountain of Youth.</i>

10:42.008 --> 10:43.540
[Furby] <i>Well, whatever
my baby wants.</i>

10:43.542 --> 10:45.007
<i>Just as long as I can show you</i>

10:45.009 --> 10:46.543
<i>the fountain
of Furby afterwards.</i>

10:46.545 --> 10:47.511
- [Veeves] <i>Ew!</i>
- [Taylor] <i>Come on, Furby.</i>

10:47.513 --> 10:47.579
[Cara] <i>So gross, dude.</i>

10:50.181 --> 10:52.281
[Jackie] Well, look at that.

10:52.283 --> 10:55.084
It would have been impossible
to find without a satellite map.

10:55.086 --> 10:57.154
[Veeves] Hey, Furby.
You wanna narrate?

10:57.156 --> 10:59.289
The state of decomposition,
seen now on the van,

10:59.291 --> 11:00.390
- is evident that...
- [Veeves] Oh, my god.

11:00.392 --> 11:01.857
- Never mind.
- [Furby] Hey, come on.

11:01.859 --> 11:03.059
- [Furby] This is gold over here.
- [Jackie] This is definitely it.

11:03.061 --> 11:05.429
- [Jackie] Wow.
- [Furby] Hey, Jackie. I...

11:05.431 --> 11:06.163
brought my projector
if you wanna curl up in there

11:06.165 --> 11:07.765
and watch movies later.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.268
[Jackie] Ew, no. Creepy.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.906
Jackie.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.908
- The Hoppers?
- Yeah.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.543
Why didn't he tell us?

11:19.545 --> 11:20.810
[Cara] I don't get it.

11:20.812 --> 11:21.678
[Taylor] It means
that Hopper didn't just go

11:21.680 --> 11:23.045
looking for some random hippies

11:23.047 --> 11:25.549
that got lost trying
to find the Fountain of Youth.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.117
He's trying to find
his missing parents.

11:28.119 --> 11:30.386
[Furby] Guys, we should totally
take a picture for my vlog.

11:30.388 --> 11:31.622
Help me out. Come on, come on.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.589
It will be the greatest
profile picture ever.

11:33.591 --> 11:34.960
[Jackie] All righty.

11:36.428 --> 11:37.429
Okay.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.064
Everybody say...

11:40.066 --> 11:41.165
"Team Hopper."

11:41.167 --> 11:42.565
[all] Team Hopper!

11:42.567 --> 11:45.202
Everybody say, "Team Furby!"

11:45.204 --> 11:46.472
- Team Furby!
- [Cara] Why?

11:48.106 --> 11:50.073
You guys suck.

11:50.075 --> 11:52.141
[Jackie] Furby, come around
and pull this back door open.

11:52.143 --> 11:53.211
[Furby] Yes, my Queen.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.814
- [Jackie grunts]
- [Furby] Aah!

11:56.816 --> 11:58.082
- [Jackie] Sorry.
- [Taylor] Oh, geez.

11:58.084 --> 11:58.949
Where'd you get this kid.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.483
Please don't tell my mom I fell.

12:00.485 --> 12:02.185
[Cara] Are you okay?
What happened?

12:02.187 --> 12:04.288
- [Furby] I tripped.
- [Taylor] You okay?

12:04.290 --> 12:05.389
I found this.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.357
- [Jackie] What?
- No, just wait. Okay?

12:07.359 --> 12:08.424
It might be a booby trap.

12:08.426 --> 12:10.461
Relax. It's not <i>The Goonies.</i>

12:10.463 --> 12:11.795
[Furby] What's <i>The Goonies?</i>

12:11.797 --> 12:13.163
- [Jackie] Seriously?
- [Furby] What?

12:13.165 --> 12:14.264
[Jackie] You haven't seen
<i>The Goonies?</i>

12:14.266 --> 12:16.366
[Taylor]
You kinda do look like Chunk.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.733
[gasps]

12:17.735 --> 12:19.035
- [Cara] What is that?
- [Jackie] Ladies and gentlemen,

12:19.037 --> 12:20.370
- we have a winner.
- [Veeves] Whoa, is that a cave?

12:20.372 --> 12:22.575
[Cara] Easy, kid.
You're just here to document.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.543
Wow.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.444
This is huge.

12:28.446 --> 12:29.512
- [Veeves] Firsties!
- [Cara] No, Veeves.

12:29.514 --> 12:31.550
- [Cara] Please stay next to me.
- Mm-hmm.

12:36.321 --> 12:39.289
[Furby] No one said
anything about caves.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.592
Caves have bats and...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.528
and bears, and...
[panting]

12:44.396 --> 12:45.531
monsters...

12:46.197 --> 12:47.199
and...

12:49.435 --> 12:50.767
[Furby gasps]
Spiders!

12:50.769 --> 12:52.102
- [Taylor] Hey, hey, hey.
- [Furby] They're everywhere.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.170
- [Furby] Let me go.
- [Taylor] Hey, they're crickets.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.205
[Veeves] Furby.
Take a chill pill, dude.

12:56.207 --> 12:58.474
- [Cara] Hey, be nice.
- [Taylor] Don't hurt yourself.

12:58.476 --> 13:01.612
Crickets, spiders...

13:01.614 --> 13:04.149
Whatever. They tried to eat me.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.282
Where's Jackie?

13:06.284 --> 13:09.218
[Jackie] I'm over here.
The rope keeps going.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.590
I'm gonna crawl further.

13:13.158 --> 13:15.692
[Jackie] Dude, it goes
over a cliff.

13:15.694 --> 13:17.630
[Furby] Don't go too far.
You complete me.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.133
[suspenseful music]

13:24.570 --> 13:26.236
[Jackie] Wait.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.471
It's been severed at the top.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.275
- Hey, clear the rope.
- [Jackie] Go ahead.

13:30.441 --> 13:31.708
[Jackie] Guys,
this room is massive.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.709
We've got our work
cut out for us.

13:33.711 --> 13:36.646
It looks like somebody went down
but they didn't come back up.

13:36.648 --> 13:37.881
[Veeves]
Someone cut Hopper's rope?

13:37.883 --> 13:39.315
[Taylor] There's no way
this is Hopper's rope.

13:39.317 --> 13:40.352
It's way too old.

13:41.686 --> 13:43.255
How far down does it go?

13:44.556 --> 13:46.490
[Jackie] Um, like...

13:46.492 --> 13:47.723
[sighs]
I can't tell.

13:47.725 --> 13:49.660
It's too deep to see the bottom.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.594
Are there any crickets?

13:51.596 --> 13:52.963
[Jackie] Some, yeah.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.264
I'm out.
[grunts]

13:54.266 --> 13:56.335
[Jackie] Professor Hopper,
are you down there?

13:58.369 --> 14:00.337
[Jackie] So, we should
probably do a second line

14:00.339 --> 14:01.905
on the descent to play it safe.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.176
[Veeves] What does that mean?

14:04.676 --> 14:05.943
[Jackie] All right, stud muffin.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.212
You're up here on lookout
until we get back.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.679
[Furby]
So, how long are we talking?

14:09.681 --> 14:11.948
[Jackie] Mm, it depends how long
it takes Cara to have a fit.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.750
- [Cara] Veeves!
- [Taylor] Great.

14:13.752 --> 14:14.784
- [Cara] Wait.
- [Veeves] Okay.

14:14.786 --> 14:16.352
[Furby]
Not to overstep my bounds

14:16.354 --> 14:17.654
but, uh...

14:17.656 --> 14:20.591
your girlfriend could be
really annoying sometimes.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.593
[Taylor chuckles]
Cara's not my girlfriend, dude.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.961
[Furby] Uh, she's not?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.563
[Taylor] No. Sometimes I don't
even think she's a girl.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.598
[Furby]
Oh, she's totally a girl.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.799
[Taylor] Furby,
how about you just shut up?

14:29.801 --> 14:31.671
- She has all the fun parts.
- Furby, shut up!

14:33.705 --> 14:35.439
[Taylor grunts]

14:35.441 --> 14:36.508
- [Taylor] All right.
- [radio chimes]

14:37.643 --> 14:39.943
Take this. Just in case.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.945
Yeah. Or we can yell.
It's 20 feet away.

14:42.947 --> 14:44.580
We don't know how far
that thing lead.

14:44.582 --> 14:46.482
And yet, you still go.

14:46.484 --> 14:47.684
Yeah.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.352
There's trail mix
and water in my duffle

14:49.354 --> 14:50.455
if we're gone too long.

14:53.524 --> 14:55.291
[Jackie] Later, Furb.

14:55.293 --> 14:57.026
- [Jackie grunts]
- [Furby] I'll miss you.

14:57.028 --> 14:58.230
[Jackie groans]

15:00.532 --> 15:02.466
[Jackie] Counting on you, stud.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.534
[Furby] Counting on me for what?

15:04.536 --> 15:05.934
[Jackie] Oh, I don't know, dude.

15:05.936 --> 15:08.405
It just sounded nicer than
"Don't screw anything up."

15:08.407 --> 15:09.606
We'll radio you at the bottom.

15:09.608 --> 15:12.041
[Furby] So, what is it?
One chime for "yes,"

15:12.043 --> 15:13.609
two chimes for "no,"
and three chimes

15:13.611 --> 15:15.011
for "I love you?"

15:15.013 --> 15:16.445
[Jackie] Uh...
[chuckles]

15:16.447 --> 15:17.546
[radio chimes twice]

15:17.548 --> 15:18.747
You really got
to focus here. Okay?

15:18.749 --> 15:19.482
[Jackie] I would have killed
to do this stuff

15:19.484 --> 15:21.785
when I was her age.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.786
I'm 13. I've been
rappelling before, so chill.

15:23.788 --> 15:25.554
Yes. But did you have
a safety instructor,

15:25.556 --> 15:26.689
and footholds, and helmets,

15:26.691 --> 15:28.592
and safety cables
in case you fell.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.660
Actually, I didn't.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.594
And that's what made it
so much fun.

15:31.596 --> 15:33.530
[sighs]

15:33.532 --> 15:35.431
- [Veeves] Hey, Jackie. Wait up.
- Relax.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.434
It's gonna be fine.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.702
Jackie knows what she's doing.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.569
Let Veeves have some fun
for once.

15:40.571 --> 15:43.475
Or if you want,
I got another harness.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.376
You can come with us.

15:46.378 --> 15:49.348
You owe me big.
You know that right?

15:49.715 --> 15:50.847
Yeah.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.583
[ominous music]

15:53.585 --> 15:54.684
[Taylor] Hey, be careful.

15:54.686 --> 15:55.720
I got it.

15:57.322 --> 15:58.323
Veeves.

15:59.691 --> 16:01.193
Veeves!

16:02.061 --> 16:03.359
[Taylor] It's fine.

16:03.361 --> 16:05.362
They would have yelled up
if there was a problem.

16:05.364 --> 16:07.430
- [Cara] You think?
- [Taylor] Yeah.

16:07.432 --> 16:08.531
[Taylor] She's just being
a little sister

16:08.533 --> 16:10.468
because you're being
a big sister.

16:11.736 --> 16:14.272
[metal clanking]

16:17.575 --> 16:19.642
[Cara] Veeves, come on.

16:19.644 --> 16:21.477
- [Cara] Veeves!
- [Taylor] <i>Veeves.</i>

16:21.479 --> 16:23.380
[Cara] Hey, shut it, punk.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.680
- [rustling]
- [Cara] Taylor, Taylor!

16:24.682 --> 16:27.617
You're fine. You're fine.
We're halfway down.

16:27.619 --> 16:29.721
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

16:31.489 --> 16:33.723
[ominous music]

16:33.725 --> 16:35.391
[Cara] It's crazy.

16:35.393 --> 16:37.461
- It's like damp.
- What?

16:37.463 --> 16:38.531
It's weird.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.396
You can feel it.

16:40.398 --> 16:41.964
[whirring]

16:41.966 --> 16:43.065
[Cara] <i>There's like
this invisible boundary,</i>

where the air
completely changes.

Boss, someone's here.
We gotta go.

[Hopper] Boss! Come on.

18:40.017 --> 18:41.486
Get in the car, boy.

Hello.

19:24.795 --> 19:25.930
I'm unarmed.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.667
Please don't shoot me.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.002
I'm from the University
Archeology Department.

19:33.004 --> 19:34.939
I came to explore your cave.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.943
My battery has died.

19:39.811 --> 19:41.847
I seem to have lost my dog.

19:47.686 --> 19:51.655
I'm gonna check your truck
for jumper cables.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.626
I'm not here to steal anything.

19:54.659 --> 19:56.561
[rustling]

19:57.329 --> 19:59.432
Just maybe your car battery.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.509
[foreboding music]

20:13.744 --> 20:15.747
[foreboding music continues]

20:21.119 --> 20:22.554
[Hopper] Jackie?

20:24.121 --> 20:25.590
Jackie!

20:29.994 --> 20:31.062
Shit.

20:45.644 --> 20:46.712
[Hopper] Jackie!

20:47.612 --> 20:49.044
Taylor!

20:49.046 --> 20:50.648
You guys in here?

20:56.621 --> 20:57.689
[Hopper] Hello!

21:00.692 --> 21:02.626
I don't remember
eating breakfast this morning.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.763
I think I'm having some kind
of an episode.

21:06.398 --> 21:07.632
[Hopper] Hello?

21:11.669 --> 21:12.837
[whirring]

21:14.339 --> 21:15.907
[Hopper] Oh, wow.

21:27.718 --> 21:28.720
[clatters]

21:33.725 --> 21:35.727
[distant whirring]

21:41.832 --> 21:44.736
[whirring continues]

21:54.178 --> 21:55.813
[Cara] I think I see the bottom.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.216
Look who changed her mind.

22:00.218 --> 22:01.551
- [Taylor] Easy on the landing.
- [Veeves] You look like a pro.

22:01.553 --> 22:02.754
[Jackie] Glad you could join us.
We were getting lonely.

22:03.821 --> 22:05.021
- [Taylor] Easy...
- Yeah. Well, how about you

22:05.023 --> 22:06.222
- answer me when I call you.
- [Veeves] Uh...

22:06.224 --> 22:06.989
I didn't hear anything
and I don't think

22:06.991 --> 22:08.057
Jackie heard anything.

22:08.059 --> 22:09.094
[Cara] Yeah. Well then,
check your ears.

22:11.161 --> 22:13.730
[chuckles]
You're so weird, dude.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.999
They're kinda boring.
Let's go explore.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.570
- [Taylor chuckles]
- Let's do it.

22:18.169 --> 22:19.604
[Jackie] Adventure time.

22:20.805 --> 22:22.806
[Cara] So pretty.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.206
- [Taylor] I know, right?
- [Cara] Whoa.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.242
[Jackie] Guys, we're gonna go
check out this tunnel.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.580
[Taylor mumbling]

22:31.215 --> 22:33.849
[Cara] Hey, Veeves.
Stay close. Come on.

22:33.851 --> 22:36.086
- [Veeves] Stay close, Cara.
- [Jackie] Veeves.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.921
[ghostly voice]
Ooh...

22:37.923 --> 22:39.191
- [Veeves] Stop.
- [Jackie] What?

22:40.024 --> 22:41.025
It's not me.

22:42.860 --> 22:44.493
Okay, careful. Watch your step.

22:44.495 --> 22:47.731
Here we go.
I wonder how far back that goes.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.966
- [Veeves] I wonder...
- [Jackie] It's crazy in there.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.868
- [groans]
- [disembodied voice]

22:52.870 --> 22:54.005
(Jackie) Did you hear that?

22:56.440 --> 22:57.642
Okay...

23:01.980 --> 23:03.949
- [disembodied voice]
- [both gasp]

23:06.517 --> 23:07.450
- [disembodied voice] Come here.
- [groaning]

23:07.452 --> 23:08.651
- [distant screaming]
- [gasps]

23:08.653 --> 23:09.386
[Veeves] Oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.820
[Veeves panicked cries]

23:11.822 --> 23:13.822
[Cara] Guys, what was that?

23:13.824 --> 23:15.026
[Jackie] You guys,
we gotta get out now.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.793
No, we didn't come this far
just to leave now,

23:17.795 --> 23:21.097
- because of some weird noises.
- [Cara] Taylor, seriously?

23:21.099 --> 23:22.464
- Yeah, I'm staying.
- [Cara] Weird noises,

23:22.466 --> 23:23.767
those were screams!

23:23.769 --> 23:24.770
[Cara] Let's go.

23:26.036 --> 23:27.470
[Taylor] Wait.

23:27.472 --> 23:28.704
I'm not leaving without Hopper.

23:28.706 --> 23:30.773
[Jackie] Cara, wait.
I'm the fastest climber.

23:30.775 --> 23:31.974
Furby and I can
pull you two up faster

23:31.976 --> 23:33.542
than you could ever
pull yourselves up.

23:33.544 --> 23:34.610
- She's right.
- Okay?

23:34.612 --> 23:35.712
I'll come back down
once they're up.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.513
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- [Taylor] You ready?

23:37.515 --> 23:39.081
One, two, three.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.785
[Jackie groaning]

23:44.923 --> 23:46.925
[tense music]

23:47.192 --> 23:48.661
[gasps]

23:50.195 --> 23:51.860
- [Jackie gasps]
- [Taylor] Whoa, no!

23:51.862 --> 23:53.032
- [Taylor groans]
- [thuds]

23:53.799 --> 23:54.864
[Veeves] Jackie!

23:54.866 --> 23:56.165
- [Cara] Jackie!
- What...

23:56.167 --> 23:57.800
[both groan]

23:57.802 --> 23:58.835
[Taylor] What happened, Jackie?

23:58.837 --> 24:00.169
[Jackie] I got it.

24:00.171 --> 24:02.004
- [moaning]
- [groaning]

24:02.006 --> 24:04.040
Awesome.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.276
[Jackie] It's okay, I got it.
[panting]

24:10.014 --> 24:11.917
[Cara] What? They cut the rope.

24:15.986 --> 24:17.153
[Jackie] Thank you.

24:17.155 --> 24:18.521
[grunts]

24:18.523 --> 24:19.992
[Taylor] Oh, shit.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.028
Furby, I swear to God, man.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.261
- He cut it?
- Geez!

24:26.263 --> 24:27.329
[Veeves] Furby wouldn't cut it!

24:27.331 --> 24:28.498
- [radio chimes]
- Furby!

24:28.500 --> 24:31.233
Stop messing around, man.
I swear to God.

24:31.235 --> 24:33.101
Drop us the rope back down,
dumbass.

24:33.103 --> 24:35.039
- You almost killed Jackie.
- [beeps]

24:39.910 --> 24:41.813
- Furby?
- [beeps]

24:43.113 --> 24:45.016
How'd he do that?
[panting]

24:46.217 --> 24:47.184
Hey, dude.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.617
- Are you okay up there?
- Shit.

24:48.619 --> 24:49.722
[radio chimes]

24:53.558 --> 24:54.890
[Cara] Okay, let me just
take it off.

24:54.892 --> 24:57.327
I know Furby since kindergarten,
he wouldn't do this.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.861
[zipper zips]

24:58.863 --> 25:00.097
- [Taylor groans]
- [Jackie] What is it?

25:00.099 --> 25:02.130
Got caught on Cara's harness
when she fell.

25:02.132 --> 25:03.265
[Cara] How bad is it?

25:03.267 --> 25:04.600
They feel broken.

25:04.602 --> 25:06.301
[Jackie sighs]

25:06.303 --> 25:08.070
Sorry, Hopper.

25:08.072 --> 25:11.074
Looks like your two
best climbers just got benched.

25:11.076 --> 25:14.010
- [Taylor] Is yours that bad?
- Yeah.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.178
Guys, we have to figure out
an exit plan.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.181
Our exit plan is for Furby
to stop being a dick

25:18.183 --> 25:19.482
and throw down another rope.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.584
[Cara] Yeah, but could you
climb it with that hand?

25:21.586 --> 25:22.885
I don't really have
a choice now, do I?

25:22.887 --> 25:24.620
[Jackie] Cara, you're gonna have
to climb freehand.

25:24.622 --> 25:25.955
[panting]
What?

25:25.957 --> 25:28.590
No, it's like 90 feet.
If she falls, she's dead.

25:28.592 --> 25:29.827
[distant thud]

25:30.962 --> 25:31.964
Um...

25:34.299 --> 25:35.801
Give me that radio.

25:37.167 --> 25:38.803
I'm gonna get an A for sure.

25:40.237 --> 25:41.404
- [beeps]
- Furby...

25:41.406 --> 25:42.871
Stop messing around, man. Okay?

25:42.873 --> 25:44.007
We got something down here
and I need you to throw down

25:44.009 --> 25:46.041
the other end of the rope
right now.

25:46.043 --> 25:47.044
[radio beeps]

25:49.947 --> 25:50.847
Furby?

25:50.849 --> 25:52.184
[Jackie] Hit the chime button.

25:53.618 --> 25:57.086
[beeping]

25:57.088 --> 25:59.792
- There's something down there.
- And they have a radio.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.293
Professor Hopper?

26:04.295 --> 26:06.061
This is Taylor, we're here
to get you out of here.

26:06.063 --> 26:06.898
[beeps]

26:08.667 --> 26:11.936
[distorted voice]
<i>Help... me.</i>

26:13.103 --> 26:14.806
- [Veeves] Cara?
- [Cara] Taylor...

26:16.373 --> 26:17.975
- [beeps]
- Who is this?

26:18.310 --> 26:19.378
[beeps]

26:22.246 --> 26:23.980
[distorted voice]
<i>It's me, over...</i>

26:23.982 --> 26:26.214
<i>Help... me.</i>

26:26.216 --> 26:29.053
- Professor Hopper, is that you?
- [beeps]

26:34.091 --> 26:35.191
[distorted voice]
[Furby] <i>Furby...</i>

26:35.193 --> 26:37.327
[Jackie] What?
Did he just say "Furby"?

26:37.329 --> 26:39.298
That doesn't sound like Furby.

26:41.131 --> 26:43.031
- [beeps]
- Who is this?

26:43.033 --> 26:44.532
Who's on this channel?

26:44.534 --> 26:47.305
[distorted voice]
[Furby] <i>Dude... It's Furby.</i>

26:51.009 --> 26:52.107
[Cara] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

26:52.109 --> 26:53.276
[Taylor]
What's it look like I'm doing?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.344
I'll figure out
what the hell is going on.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.279
[Cara] No, you can't go
in there alone.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.114
- [Veeves] Let's go.
- No, no.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.182
You can't go alone.

26:59.184 --> 27:00.649
And you're staying here
with Jackie.

27:00.651 --> 27:04.087
The one person who doesn't stand
a chance to defend herself,

27:04.089 --> 27:06.088
I'll take my chances
with you guys, thanks.

27:06.090 --> 27:07.257
Are you kidding me? No.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.758
If it were Hopper,
he would've said so,

27:08.760 --> 27:10.359
so sit your butt down.
Right now.

27:10.361 --> 27:11.429
Who's gonna stop me?

27:15.132 --> 27:16.732
See? You see now?

27:16.734 --> 27:18.467
Why I didn't wanna bring
a 13-year-old into this cave?

27:18.469 --> 27:19.769
Well, there would've been
no problem,

27:19.771 --> 27:21.370
except for her stupid friend
who cut the rope.

27:21.372 --> 27:22.437
He didn't cut the rope.

27:22.439 --> 27:23.507
[rumbling]

27:26.110 --> 27:27.743
Honey, I think
the class project is over.

27:27.745 --> 27:29.244
This is the kind of thing
only a camera

27:29.246 --> 27:30.413
can prove actually happened,

27:30.415 --> 27:32.415
and you don't want to have
a record of it?

27:32.417 --> 27:33.715
[Jackie]
If she's shining the light,

27:33.717 --> 27:35.286
she might as well be rolling.

27:38.555 --> 27:40.289
Well, we can sit here
and wait forever,

27:40.291 --> 27:41.357
or we can do
what we came down here to do

27:41.359 --> 27:43.095
and figure out
what's over there.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.500
I hate all of you.

27:54.171 --> 27:55.172
[sighs]

27:57.042 --> 27:58.443
Bye, guys. I'll be here.

28:01.446 --> 28:04.146
[Jackie] I feel like I got put
in a time-out.

28:04.148 --> 28:06.315
"Just go wait
by yourself, Jackie."

28:06.317 --> 28:09.318
"Yeah, go ahead.
Stand in the corner."

28:09.320 --> 28:10.489
Blair Witch will see you now.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.655
[beeps]

28:13.657 --> 28:15.424
[Taylor] <i>I don't hear it
chiming back anymore.</i>

28:15.426 --> 28:17.426
[Veeves] <i>Do you think maybe
they just turned it off?</i>

28:17.428 --> 28:18.761
[Taylor] <i>Let's hope so.</i>

28:18.763 --> 28:20.064
[Cara] <i>Watch your head.</i>

28:20.831 --> 28:22.066
Professor Hopper?

28:24.436 --> 28:27.069
[Cara] Now this cave's
got to be really old.

28:27.071 --> 28:28.471
[Taylor] Professor Hopper?

28:28.473 --> 28:30.205
[Cara] Look at the formations.

28:30.207 --> 28:31.441
[Veeves]
Oh, so you're a cave expert now.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.378
[Cara] I watched
the Discover Channel with Dad.

28:35.780 --> 28:36.982
There's light ahead.

28:41.619 --> 28:43.021
[clattering]

28:44.089 --> 28:45.957
[beeping]

28:48.158 --> 28:49.160
[sighs]

28:51.495 --> 28:52.496
Guys?

28:59.536 --> 29:00.538
[rumbling]

29:01.339 --> 29:02.374
[Jackie] Furby?

29:04.509 --> 29:06.311
[Veeves] Why is the light
moving like that?

29:07.278 --> 29:08.347
[Taylor] I don't know.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.017
I've never seen
anything like it.

29:12.617 --> 29:14.086
[Cara] That's so weird.

29:16.353 --> 29:18.588
[Veeves]
Look, the tunnel keeps going.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.822
[Taylor]
It's probably just Furby

29:19.824 --> 29:22.157
screwing with his flashlight
or something.

29:22.159 --> 29:24.359
[Taylor] Hey, Furby!

29:24.361 --> 29:26.130
- [Cara] Hey, give me a boost.
- [whirring]

29:28.132 --> 29:30.167
- [Taylor] Got it?
- [Cara] Yeah, I'm good.

29:30.534 --> 29:33.138
[panting]

29:41.212 --> 29:43.548
There's a rope...
[gasps]

29:44.882 --> 29:47.383
Oh, my god.

29:47.385 --> 29:49.684
Oh my god, Taylor,
take Veeves to the other room.

29:49.686 --> 29:51.154
Why?

29:51.156 --> 29:53.155
Just take her to the other room!

29:53.157 --> 29:54.857
- What's wrong?
- Damn it, Taylor!

29:54.859 --> 29:56.427
- Take her to the other room!
- Yeah.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.397
Come on.

30:00.932 --> 30:02.334
[sobs]

30:04.601 --> 30:06.702
- What's she freaking out about?
- I don't know.

30:06.704 --> 30:09.140
She's your sister
so we're gonna listen to her.

30:13.378 --> 30:14.443
What is that?

30:14.445 --> 30:15.580
[panting]

30:16.680 --> 30:18.082
- Shh.
- What?

30:19.583 --> 30:21.285
[Jackie] Hey, guys. What's up?

30:22.887 --> 30:25.453
- What are you doing?
- [Jackie] Oh, not much.

30:25.455 --> 30:27.623
Just... Can't walk, and...

30:27.625 --> 30:30.459
You guys definitely left me
in that scary room

30:30.461 --> 30:32.328
for what felt like forever.

30:32.330 --> 30:35.463
[Jackie] But, uh, you know,
enough about me.

30:35.465 --> 30:38.466
How you doing?
How's your day been?

30:38.468 --> 30:40.435
- [Taylor] There you go.
- Taylor!

30:40.437 --> 30:42.405
- [Jackie] That room is creepy.
- [Taylor] Right there.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.940
- There you go.
- [Cara sobbing]

30:43.942 --> 30:46.274
- What did you see up there?
- No! Sit.

30:46.276 --> 30:47.710
[Veeves] I'm not your dog, dude.

30:47.712 --> 30:49.712
[Jackie] Take it easy, Cara.

30:49.714 --> 30:51.616
We're all dealing
with the same thing.

30:53.484 --> 30:54.653
[sobbing]
Take off your camera.

30:55.686 --> 30:57.686
[Veeves] What's going on?

30:57.688 --> 30:59.356
Whatever it is, it'll be okay.

31:04.395 --> 31:07.396
[Taylor] Oh, my god. Cara.

31:07.398 --> 31:09.732
Enough with the suspense, guys.
What is it?

31:09.734 --> 31:11.934
[Taylor] Stay over there!

31:11.936 --> 31:13.668
- We can't just leave him here.
- Leave who?

31:13.670 --> 31:14.971
[Taylor] Jackie don't let her
come over here.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.241
Is it Hopper?

31:19.644 --> 31:21.646
[Cara] Don't move. Okay?
I mean it.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.219
[gasps]
[Jackie] No.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.386
- [Jackie] Wait, stop.
- Oh, my god. Cara!

31:30.388 --> 31:31.654
No, Veeves, no!

31:31.656 --> 31:32.722
- Is that Furby?
- No!

31:32.724 --> 31:34.257
[Taylor] Hey, no, no, no!

31:34.259 --> 31:36.392
- [sobbing]
- Is he okay?

31:36.394 --> 31:38.493
[Veeves] Is he
gonna be all right?

31:38.495 --> 31:40.398
Is he gonna be all right?
[sobs]

31:42.600 --> 31:44.269
[Taylor]
I think his neck is broken.

31:49.273 --> 31:50.609
[muffled]
[Veeves] How did this happen?

31:54.012 --> 31:56.544
[Jackie] I don't know
but we're gonna be okay.

31:56.546 --> 31:58.415
- It's gonna be okay.
- [Veeves sobbing]

32:02.786 --> 32:05.588
I think he tried to climb down,
and somebody cut his rope.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.057
[Veeves sobbing]
Who would do this to us?

32:08.059 --> 32:10.328
Who would cut Furby's rope?

32:15.532 --> 32:17.433
[Cara] He didn't even want
to come down in the first place.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.602
Why would he descend alone?

32:20.605 --> 32:23.208
[Taylor] Oh, wow.
The camera's still on.

32:24.742 --> 32:27.076
[Cara] Is there anything Furby
didn't bring in that backpack?

32:27.078 --> 32:28.376
Grappling hook
would've been nice.

32:28.378 --> 32:29.511
<i>Team Hopper!</i>

32:29.513 --> 32:30.715
[video rewinding]

32:32.050 --> 32:33.616
[Cara] Okay. This is it.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.550
[Jackie] <i>Counting on you, stud.</i>

32:35.552 --> 32:37.853
[Furby] <i>Counting on me for what?</i>

32:37.855 --> 32:39.588
[Jackie] <i>I don't know, dude.
It just sounded nicer</i>

32:39.590 --> 32:41.022
<i>than "Don't screw anything up."</i>

32:41.024 --> 32:42.724
<i>We'll radio you at the bottom!</i>

32:42.726 --> 32:44.425
[Furby] <i>So, what is it?
Like, one chime for "yes,"</i>

32:44.427 --> 32:47.730
<i>two chimes for "no," and
three chimes for "I love you"?</i>

32:47.732 --> 32:49.434
[Jackie] <i>Uh...</i>
[giggling]

32:55.439 --> 32:56.472
[imitates Australian accent]
<i>Not sure if the rescue rangers</i>

32:56.474 --> 32:58.107
<i>are playing a joke on me.</i>

32:58.109 --> 33:00.809
<i>But it's been radio silence
for like half an hour.</i>

33:00.811 --> 33:02.379
<i>Crikey, we better head over
and check it out.</i>

33:06.451 --> 33:07.817
<i>Hello?</i>

33:07.819 --> 33:09.687
<i>Hey, guys. What's the deal?</i>

33:13.757 --> 33:14.758
[sighs]

33:16.793 --> 33:18.728
<i>I'm trying not to think
about it too much</i>

33:18.730 --> 33:21.597
<i>'cause I'm not really
wired that way.</i>

33:21.599 --> 33:23.732
<i>But it's kinda strange,
you know?</i>

33:23.734 --> 33:25.704
<i>And, "by strange," I mean scary.</i>

33:26.737 --> 33:28.370
<i>And, "by scary," I mean,</i>

33:28.372 --> 33:31.440
<i>I wish I haven't started
thinking about it.</i>

33:31.442 --> 33:32.907
<i>And now that I've been
thinking about it too much,</i>

33:32.909 --> 33:34.478
<i>I kinda hate myself.</i>

33:38.515 --> 33:39.618
<i>Now I have to poop.</i>

33:41.819 --> 33:44.520
[Furby] <i>So, I was trying to find
a place to do a twosie,</i>

33:44.522 --> 33:46.388
<i>and, oh, look what I found.</i>

33:46.390 --> 33:48.723
<i>A cave, a rope, and a jeep.</i>

33:48.725 --> 33:50.224
<i>Do you guys think this is
where Hopper went down?</i>

33:50.226 --> 33:52.494
<i>Because I do.
Good work, Sherlock.</i>

33:52.496 --> 33:54.298
<i>You went down the wrong hole.</i>

33:55.666 --> 33:57.465
<i>So I found
Hopper's dad's journal,</i>

33:57.467 --> 33:59.001
<i>and it looks like he had
a little too much herbal fun</i>

33:59.003 --> 34:01.869
<i>in the '60s,
if you know what I mean,</i>

34:01.871 --> 34:04.806
<i>and got obsessed with a bunch
of fandom youth mythology.</i>

34:04.808 --> 34:06.442
<i>Just a bunch
of drawings and stories</i>

34:06.444 --> 34:08.143
<i>about Spanish conquistadors</i>

34:08.145 --> 34:10.445
<i>trying to find some cave
that the natives said</i>

34:10.447 --> 34:12.683
<i>contained magical healing waters
or something.</i>

34:14.886 --> 34:17.152
<i>It says the queen sent
a dozen expeditions</i>

34:17.154 --> 34:18.954
<i>to find this water
and bring a vial of it</i>

34:18.956 --> 34:20.889
<i>to her dying husband.</i>

34:20.891 --> 34:22.358
<i>All but one of the expeditions</i>

34:22.360 --> 34:23.391
<i>either died at the hands
of the natives,</i>

34:23.393 --> 34:25.761
<i>or returned empty handed.</i>

34:25.763 --> 34:27.262
<i>The last expedition disappeared</i>

34:27.264 --> 34:29.532
<i>somewhere northwest
of the Alamo.</i>

34:29.534 --> 34:30.933
<i>That sounds familiar.</i>

34:30.935 --> 34:31.867
<i>And it's the last thing
I wanna read</i>

34:31.869 --> 34:33.538
<i>before it gets dark.</i>

34:34.205 --> 34:35.670
[coyotes yelping]

34:35.672 --> 34:37.840
Guys, why is it sunset?

34:37.842 --> 34:41.509
There's no way it's that dark.
It's one o'clock.

34:41.511 --> 34:42.811
[Veeves] He must have a filter
on the camera.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.246
It's some kind of a joke.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.980
- [Furby] <i>Hear that...</i>
- It's gotta be a joke.

34:45.982 --> 34:47.449
[Furby] <i>...are after something.</i>

34:47.451 --> 34:49.552
How is it a joke? It's dark,
and that's your dad's jeep.

34:49.554 --> 34:50.853
- So, I don't know what...
- Guys, if Furby's dead,

34:50.855 --> 34:52.520
he's probably not joking.

34:52.522 --> 34:55.657
<i>It's midnight now
and you guys aren't back.</i>

34:55.659 --> 34:58.793
<i>My cell has no signal
and is dead.</i>

34:58.795 --> 35:01.463
<i>I've no idea how to drive
this thing, so...</i>

35:01.465 --> 35:03.599
<i>Cara, when you see this,</i>

35:03.601 --> 35:05.835
<i>have fun dealing with the wrath
that is my mother.</i>

35:05.837 --> 35:06.871
[coyotes barking]

35:08.839 --> 35:10.306
<i>Okay, so I'm not gonna lie,</i>

35:10.308 --> 35:11.974
<i>I got a little freaked out
by the coyotes</i>

35:11.976 --> 35:14.342
<i>so I turned the projector off
and read a little more</i>

35:14.344 --> 35:16.779
<i>of Hopper's
dad's journal instead.</i>

35:16.781 --> 35:19.815
<i>So this magic water
healing story</i>

35:19.817 --> 35:21.349
<i>has been pass down
through his family</i>

35:21.351 --> 35:24.786
<i>but it wasn't until Hopper's dad
had kids of his own,</i>

35:24.788 --> 35:27.623
<i>and his daughter got sick,</i>

35:27.625 --> 35:28.991
<i>till he went looking
for the cave.</i>

35:28.993 --> 35:31.893
<i>Which means, that this chick</i>

35:31.895 --> 35:34.730
<i>is the reason
my friends are missing.</i>

35:34.732 --> 35:36.699
<i>And coyotes
are gonna eat me tonight.</i>

35:36.701 --> 35:37.936
[coyotes yelping]

35:40.804 --> 35:42.170
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

35:42.172 --> 35:43.739
<i>My mom probably
had a heart attack</i>

35:43.741 --> 35:44.876
<i>'cause I didn't come home
last night.</i>

35:45.944 --> 35:47.610
[sighs]
<i>And you know what sucks?</i>

35:47.612 --> 35:50.012
<i>It just occurred to me that
no one knows we're here</i>

35:50.014 --> 35:51.380
<i>because we told them we're going</i>

35:51.382 --> 35:52.848
- <i>to Hamilton Pool.</i>
- What's happening?

35:52.850 --> 35:54.516
Taylor...

35:54.518 --> 35:58.219
- This is a total mind fuck.
- Jackie...

35:58.221 --> 36:00.523
[Furby] <i>So, not only am I
all alone up here,</i>

36:00.525 --> 36:02.257
<i>but I have no idea
how to get back,</i>

36:02.259 --> 36:04.995
<i>no way to get back,
and no one's looking for me.</i>

36:06.596 --> 36:07.663
[Furby] <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

36:07.665 --> 36:08.666
[birds squawking]

36:09.534 --> 36:10.635
<i>It's Tuesday now.</i>

36:11.636 --> 36:13.601
<i>The jeep is dead</i>

36:13.603 --> 36:16.672
<i>because I listened to the radio
all night because...</i>

36:16.674 --> 36:20.009
<i>I might or might not be
afraid of the dark.</i>

36:20.011 --> 36:23.945
<i>I ate all the food I could find
and drink all the water.</i>

36:23.947 --> 36:26.014
<i>And at this point
I've decided...</i>

36:26.016 --> 36:27.650
<i>That my friends
are probably dead.</i>

36:27.652 --> 36:31.654
<i>And the only way
I'm gonna survive this...</i>

36:31.656 --> 36:33.721
<i>is if I climb down
with Hopper's rope</i>

36:33.723 --> 36:34.892
<i>and look for his car keys.</i>

36:38.895 --> 36:40.895
<i>All right,
this part's for my mom.</i>

36:40.897 --> 36:42.565
<i>I'm really sorry
I didn't call you</i>

36:42.567 --> 36:44.366
<i>to tell you where I went.</i>

36:44.368 --> 36:46.837
<i>I was just really excited
to make some new friends.</i>

36:47.337 --> 36:48.904
<i>And...</i>

36:48.906 --> 36:51.639
<i>I think they really like me
this time.</i>

36:51.641 --> 36:54.846
<i>And, if for some reason,
you guys find this...</i>

36:56.313 --> 36:57.714
<i>I really hope you make it home.</i>

36:59.717 --> 37:01.116
<i>Cool, calm, collected.</i>

37:01.118 --> 37:02.821
<i>Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.</i>

37:04.054 --> 37:05.723
<i>All right, let's party.</i>

37:08.625 --> 37:10.659
<i>Here we go.
Cool, calm, collected.</i>

37:10.661 --> 37:12.860
<i>Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.</i>

37:12.862 --> 37:14.730
[sighs]
<i>Like a real man.</i>

37:14.732 --> 37:17.733
[groans]
<i>Cool...</i>

37:17.735 --> 37:19.768
<i>Calm...</i>

37:19.770 --> 37:20.871
<i>And collect...</i>

37:22.139 --> 37:24.008
- [whirring]
- <i>What the heck is that?</i>

37:26.344 --> 37:28.610
What is it?

37:28.612 --> 37:30.645
- [Furby] <i>Whoa!</i>
- He sees something.

37:30.647 --> 37:32.015
[whirring]

37:33.918 --> 37:35.116
- [snaps]
- [gasps]

37:35.118 --> 37:36.652
[Furby screaming]

37:36.654 --> 37:37.989
- [loud thud]
- [Veeves] Oh, my god.

37:40.725 --> 37:41.726
Please turn it off.

37:42.759 --> 37:43.861
So you got your answer.

37:44.761 --> 37:46.094
Are you satisfied?

37:46.096 --> 37:48.364
Or do you wanna keep going
until we're all dead?

37:48.366 --> 37:50.898
[Veeves] It doesn't make sense.
The timecode spans several days.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.668
We've only been in here an hour.

37:53.670 --> 37:55.971
[Cara] Maybe we fell asleep
on the way down or something...

37:55.973 --> 37:58.907
All of us?
Are you kidding right now?

37:58.909 --> 38:01.376
I never fell asleep.
Did you fall asleep?

38:01.378 --> 38:02.578
- Did you fall asleep?
- [Taylor] No...

38:02.580 --> 38:03.645
- Nobody fell asleep!
- Jackie, calm down!

38:03.647 --> 38:04.713
[Cara] Well, what do you
want me to say?

38:04.715 --> 38:06.815
Don't you think
if I had an answer,

38:06.817 --> 38:07.949
I would share it with you?

38:07.951 --> 38:09.384
You may not have an answer,

38:09.386 --> 38:10.886
but you're the only one
with an option

38:10.888 --> 38:11.719
that the rest of don't have.

38:11.721 --> 38:13.123
Yeah, what option is that?

38:15.692 --> 38:17.092
You're the only one
who has a chance

38:17.094 --> 38:18.630
of climbing out of here?

38:24.868 --> 38:26.670
- [Veeves] Maybe I can do it?
- No.

38:27.971 --> 38:29.904
It's Veeves or it's you.

38:29.906 --> 38:31.840
Or we go deeper into the cave,

38:31.842 --> 38:33.308
we cross our fingers
and we hope...

38:33.310 --> 38:36.078
No, no. It's way too dangerous.
You saw what happened to Furby.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.079
Yeah, well, it's more dangerous
if we stay down here.

38:38.081 --> 38:40.049
There is somebody up there
cutting the ropes.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.784
Yeah, well, I don't have a rope
for them to cut.

38:41.786 --> 38:42.918
- So, what does it matter?
- [Taylor] No.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.887
None of this was supposed
to happen.

38:44.889 --> 38:48.456
You went looking for someone
who went missing

38:48.458 --> 38:51.826
while he was looking for
someone else that went missing.

38:51.828 --> 38:53.063
What'd you think would happen?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.396
I don't know.

38:55.398 --> 38:56.697
I thought that we were
a step ahead

38:56.699 --> 38:59.571
because we found the rope
leading off of the van.

39:01.105 --> 39:02.173
Okay, I'm sorry.

39:08.112 --> 39:10.114
[somber music]

39:14.217 --> 39:15.583
[Cara] You're gonna be okay.

39:15.585 --> 39:16.684
You're with Taylor and Jackie,
for a little while.

39:16.686 --> 39:19.822
- [Veeves] Why?
- [Cara] Jackie's right.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.626
I'm the only one
who can get us out.

39:32.802 --> 39:33.904
[Veeves] Still rolling.

39:34.871 --> 39:35.873
You never know.

39:37.741 --> 39:38.976
Can I count on you?

39:52.056 --> 39:53.057
[sighs]

39:59.764 --> 40:00.765
[Taylor] Hey.

40:01.799 --> 40:02.800
[Cara] Hey.

40:03.299 --> 40:04.735
Just hold on.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.074
[Taylor] Here.

40:11.976 --> 40:13.044
Take this with you.

40:14.043 --> 40:15.911
It's a GPS beacon.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.846
It'll send out an SOS
from anywhere in the world.

40:18.848 --> 40:20.916
It'll work once you
get to the surface.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.985
I packed it once I realized
how stupid it might be

40:22.987 --> 40:24.920
going looking for somebody
who went missing

40:24.922 --> 40:26.824
while he was looking
for somebody that went missing.

40:30.194 --> 40:34.929
And, hey, don't come down
without help, okay?

40:34.931 --> 40:37.034
Why do I get the feeling
you know what's going on here?

40:38.569 --> 40:39.771
I don't.

40:40.203 --> 40:41.272
You won't tell me?

40:43.206 --> 40:45.507
Fine. I mean, I'd like to know
what I'm climbing up to.

40:45.509 --> 40:47.844
I think you owe me at least
that much, don't you?

40:50.815 --> 40:51.916
I think it's the sun.

40:53.350 --> 40:55.083
I think it's days and nights.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.884
That's why the timecode
didn't match the videos.

40:56.886 --> 40:58.554
Seriously?

40:58.556 --> 41:00.956
That might be the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.026
It's just an idea.

41:08.165 --> 41:09.233
Please don't fall.

41:14.971 --> 41:15.973
[sighs]

41:17.174 --> 41:18.976
[Taylor] I'll be right here
if you need me.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.884
[suspenseful music]

41:30.253 --> 41:32.587
[panting]

41:32.589 --> 41:34.322
[Taylor] Remember,
alert the beacon first,

41:34.324 --> 41:37.058
- then drop the rope.
- I know, I know!

41:37.060 --> 41:39.796
Alert the beacon, drop the rope.

41:40.864 --> 41:41.998
Don't look down.

41:43.132 --> 41:44.599
- Okay.
- [Taylor] It should beep twice

41:44.601 --> 41:46.002
when it picks up a satellite.

41:57.982 --> 41:59.248
(rocks crumbling)

41:59.250 --> 42:00.284
How you doing?

42:01.317 --> 42:02.319
[Cara] Almost there!

42:07.290 --> 42:09.025
I can feel
the air changing again!

42:11.328 --> 42:13.230
[panting]

42:18.067 --> 42:19.369
- Okay.
- [wind whistling]

42:22.339 --> 42:24.342
[tense music]

42:28.177 --> 42:29.946
[panting]

42:35.052 --> 42:36.087
[coughs]

42:39.355 --> 42:40.357
[coughs]

42:41.625 --> 42:43.090
Taylor!

42:43.092 --> 42:44.962
Taylor, the rope is gone!

42:45.328 --> 42:47.061
[coughing]

42:47.063 --> 42:48.398
There's something wrong
with the air!

42:49.699 --> 42:50.967
Taylor!

42:52.168 --> 42:54.938
Okay.
[coughing]

42:57.074 --> 42:58.940
[beeping]
Damn it!

42:58.942 --> 43:00.076
I'm gonna get a signal!

43:01.078 --> 43:02.344
Come on!
[gasping]

43:02.346 --> 43:04.947
[beeps]
Shit!

43:04.949 --> 43:06.918
[Cara sobbing]
Come on! Please work.

43:08.485 --> 43:09.821
[beeps]

43:11.054 --> 43:12.056
[coughing]

43:13.357 --> 43:16.358
Oh, my god. Seriously?

43:16.360 --> 43:18.128
[coughing]
Oh, come on.

43:18.462 --> 43:19.831
Come on!

43:27.036 --> 43:29.040
[tense music]

43:31.708 --> 43:33.043
Come on.
[sobbing]

43:35.279 --> 43:36.280
Okay...

43:38.382 --> 43:39.984
[coughing]

43:44.087 --> 43:45.989
[panting]

43:54.063 --> 43:55.165
[device beeps]

43:59.469 --> 44:01.471
[suspenseful music]

44:07.143 --> 44:08.145
Taylor!

44:11.181 --> 44:12.183
Taylor!

44:14.384 --> 44:15.953
You won't believe what happened.

44:17.286 --> 44:19.387
[Taylor] What do you mean
"what happened?"

44:19.389 --> 44:21.422
I have never seen
anything like it.

44:21.424 --> 44:23.025
Everything's gone, okay?

44:23.027 --> 44:24.360
There's no trees,
there's no grass.

44:24.362 --> 44:28.230
There's just rock everywhere,
these formations.

44:28.232 --> 44:30.465
[Taylor] Wait,
what about the GPS?

44:30.467 --> 44:33.137
I tried to activate the beacon
but I couldn't get a signal.

44:34.571 --> 44:35.770
[Taylor] It worked
before we left,

44:35.772 --> 44:36.871
I checked it in the jeep.

44:36.873 --> 44:38.040
Well, I walked
all over the place,

44:38.042 --> 44:40.509
I couldn't activate
the stupid thing.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.543
- [Jackie] Hello?
- [Veeves] Come on, I got you.

44:42.545 --> 44:44.012
- [Jackie] A little help?
- [Cara] I think...

44:44.014 --> 44:45.514
- [Cara] I think a bomb went off.
- [Taylor] Here, let me help you.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.049
[Jackie groans]

44:47.051 --> 44:49.317
When... when we came down.

44:49.319 --> 44:51.319
- There's something in the sky.
- [Taylor] Here, sit down.

44:51.321 --> 44:53.822
[panting]
There's a whole lot to tell you.

44:53.824 --> 44:54.690
- I'll tell you when I get down.
- [Jackie] If you guys can stop

44:54.692 --> 44:57.425
running off. It's just an idea.

44:57.427 --> 44:58.626
[Veeves] Come on, I got you.

44:58.628 --> 45:00.031
[Taylor] Be careful,
you're almost down.

45:02.331 --> 45:04.166
[Cara groans]

45:04.168 --> 45:05.436
Cara, come on, dude.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.005
[Cara sighs]

45:09.406 --> 45:11.409
[panting]

45:13.844 --> 45:15.610
"Come on" what?

45:15.612 --> 45:18.079
You were gone for, like,
two seconds.

45:18.081 --> 45:19.815
If you don't wanna climb
all the way up, just say so.

45:19.817 --> 45:20.916
I don't get it.

45:20.918 --> 45:24.219
It's not really
a good time for jokes.

45:24.221 --> 45:27.157
No, I'm not joking.
Just watch the stupid playback.

45:28.391 --> 45:29.960
[Cara] Just watch it.

45:30.527 --> 45:31.529
[Cara exhales sharply]

45:33.197 --> 45:34.228
[beeps]

45:34.230 --> 45:35.265
[Jackie] Okay.

45:37.167 --> 45:38.235
[Taylor] <i>How you doing?</i>

45:39.502 --> 45:41.037
[Cara] <i>Almost there.</i>

45:43.373 --> 45:45.141
<i>I can feel the air
changing again.</i>

45:50.114 --> 45:53.083
<i>Taylor!
Taylor the rope is gone!</i>

45:53.851 --> 45:55.284
[Cara coughing]

45:55.286 --> 45:57.021
<i>There's something wrong
with the air!</i>

45:58.255 --> 45:59.290
<i>Taylor!</i>

46:01.859 --> 46:03.326
[coughing]

46:05.261 --> 46:06.263
<i>Shit.</i>

46:07.364 --> 46:08.366
[sighs]

46:10.266 --> 46:11.268
Hey.

46:12.136 --> 46:13.835
Will you say something?

46:13.837 --> 46:15.172
<i>...gonna get a signal!</i>

46:27.551 --> 46:28.552
[Taylor] Veeves...

46:29.418 --> 46:30.420
play mine.

46:35.159 --> 46:37.395
[Jackie] This isn't possible.
How is this possible?

46:39.295 --> 46:40.297
Why is that?

46:41.697 --> 46:43.067
[Taylor] <i>How you doing?</i>

46:44.368 --> 46:46.233
[Cara] <i>Almost there.</i>

46:46.235 --> 46:48.402
- <i>Taylor!</i>
- [Taylor] <i>What?</i>

46:48.404 --> 46:50.005
[Cara] <i>You won't believe
what happened!</i>

46:50.007 --> 46:52.239
[Taylor] <i>What do you mean
"what happened"?</i>

46:52.241 --> 46:54.007
[Taylor] Believe me now?

46:54.009 --> 46:55.876
[Cara] <i>Everything's gone, okay?
There's no trees...</i>

46:55.878 --> 46:57.581
Guys, I was up there
for 30 minutes.

46:58.581 --> 47:00.315
This is seconds.

47:00.317 --> 47:02.319
[video playing continuously]

47:03.420 --> 47:04.588
Why are the tapes different?

47:06.355 --> 47:07.454
Why are the tapes different?

47:07.456 --> 47:10.192
What the hell
is going on, Taylor?

47:10.194 --> 47:12.527
[Taylor] I realized something
when we watched Furby's tape.

47:12.529 --> 47:14.628
A night had passed
in his footage.

47:14.630 --> 47:17.599
But the rope was still running
from the cave to the van.

47:17.601 --> 47:20.467
It wasn't a person
who cut the rope...

47:20.469 --> 47:23.073
It was friction,
over a long period of time.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.607
What?

47:25.609 --> 47:27.241
Time is passing differently
down here,

47:27.243 --> 47:28.344
than it is on the surface.

47:29.246 --> 47:30.247
What?

47:32.348 --> 47:34.215
It's the sun.

47:34.217 --> 47:35.286
Rising and setting.

47:36.752 --> 47:37.985
It's the only way
that Furby's tape

47:37.987 --> 47:39.253
was days ahead of ours,

47:39.255 --> 47:40.487
even though we all came in
at the same time.

47:40.489 --> 47:43.491
What? How long
have we been down here for?

47:43.493 --> 47:45.326
I have a date this weekend.

47:45.328 --> 47:46.661
[Taylor] Seriously?

47:46.663 --> 47:48.465
We've been in here weeks,
maybe months already.

47:49.632 --> 47:51.634
[Cara sobbing]

47:52.703 --> 47:54.235
I'm sorry, Veeves.

47:54.237 --> 47:55.638
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

47:57.975 --> 48:00.407
Why am I the one crying?

48:00.409 --> 48:02.376
You're 13.

48:02.378 --> 48:05.447
I'm not crying
because you're my big sister.

48:05.449 --> 48:07.251
And I know
you'll get us out of here.

48:10.286 --> 48:11.554
[Cara sighs]

48:12.489 --> 48:14.492
[dramatic music]

48:17.427 --> 48:18.429
Whoa.

48:20.364 --> 48:23.234
So, every time that happens,
that's a day?

48:27.503 --> 48:29.507
[Jackie] Wait.
The Fountain of Youth.

48:30.973 --> 48:33.476
So, it's like if time stops...

48:34.543 --> 48:35.777
you stay young forever.

48:35.779 --> 48:37.681
Guys, this really is
the Fountain of Youth.

48:40.817 --> 48:42.152
Nothing?

48:42.819 --> 48:44.154
Okay.

48:46.355 --> 48:47.491
We have to get out of here.

48:48.625 --> 48:50.261
[Taylor groans]

48:53.730 --> 48:56.431
[ominous music]

48:56.433 --> 48:57.434
[clatters]

48:58.402 --> 49:00.304
[rope rustling]

49:02.371 --> 49:04.072
We've gotta have enough rope
in between what we've got here

49:04.074 --> 49:05.676
and what we've got in the
other room to get out of here.

49:06.543 --> 49:07.976
[Cara] For what?

49:07.978 --> 49:10.311
You want me to climb back
up there with all that rope?

49:10.313 --> 49:11.447
[Taylor] I'm running out
of ideas here.

49:13.417 --> 49:15.583
[Veeves] Take some time to rest.

49:15.585 --> 49:17.585
[Cara] Just give me
like ten minutes.

49:17.587 --> 49:20.355
Ten minutes?
We don't have ten minutes.

49:20.357 --> 49:21.755
It's gonna take Taylor and I
at least half an hour,

49:21.757 --> 49:22.792
to climb out of here.

49:24.460 --> 49:27.094
How long is half an hour
down here?

49:27.096 --> 49:29.364
[Taylor] Cara, you found Furby
facing down, right?

49:29.366 --> 49:30.565
[Cara] Yeah. Why?

49:30.567 --> 49:32.366
[Taylor] In the video,
he was on his side.

49:32.368 --> 49:33.802
And his radio wasn't smashed.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.307
So, what smashed his radio?

49:41.844 --> 49:44.681
[Furby] <i>Whoa.
What the heck is that?</i>

49:45.482 --> 49:46.614
[Furby grunts]

49:46.616 --> 49:48.351
<i>Aah!</i>
[thuds]

49:50.052 --> 49:52.619
[recording squeaking]

49:52.621 --> 49:53.757
Great, this is it.

49:55.225 --> 49:57.458
[Taylor] <i>Furby,
stop messing around, man.</i>

49:57.460 --> 49:59.027
<i>I swear to God.</i>

49:59.029 --> 50:00.762
[Cara] <i>Drop us the rope
back down, dumbass.</i>

50:00.764 --> 50:02.366
<i>You almost killed Jackie.</i>

50:05.802 --> 50:06.804
[Cara] <i>Furby?</i>

50:08.138 --> 50:09.003
[Furby groans]

50:09.005 --> 50:10.773
Wait, Furby was still alive?

50:12.442 --> 50:13.907
[Furby moaning]

50:13.909 --> 50:15.509
[Veeves] <i>Hey, dude.
Are you okay up there?</i>

50:15.511 --> 50:16.777
[Furby groans]

50:16.779 --> 50:17.947
[Jackie] So, it really was him
on the radio.

50:20.417 --> 50:22.384
[Taylor] <i>Furby,
stop messing around, man, okay?</i>

50:22.386 --> 50:24.219
<i>We got something down here,</i>

50:24.221 --> 50:24.987
<i>and I need you to throw down
the other end of the rope.</i>

50:24.989 --> 50:25.454
<i>Right now.</i>

50:25.456 --> 50:26.154
[grunts]

50:26.156 --> 50:28.655
[Taylor] <i>Furby?</i>

50:28.657 --> 50:30.261
- [Furby groans]
- [radio beeps]

50:31.395 --> 50:33.128
[Taylor] <i>Professor Hopper?</i>

50:33.130 --> 50:34.496
<i>This is Taylor, we're gonna
get you out of here.</i>

50:34.498 --> 50:35.532
Help me.

50:36.833 --> 50:37.835
[Taylor] <i>Who is this?</i>

50:39.603 --> 50:40.671
[radio beeps]

50:45.174 --> 50:46.609
Taylor, help me.

50:49.179 --> 50:50.612
[Taylor] <i>Professor Hopper?</i>

50:50.614 --> 50:51.615
<i>Is that you?</i>

50:53.917 --> 50:55.286
[Furby] <i>Furby...</i>

50:56.953 --> 50:58.520
[Taylor] <i>Who is this?</i>

50:58.522 --> 51:00.121
<i>Who's on this channel?</i>

51:00.123 --> 51:01.588
Dude, it's Furby.

51:01.590 --> 51:02.592
[grunts]

51:03.893 --> 51:05.395
[Veeves gasps]

51:06.196 --> 51:08.730
[snarls]

51:08.732 --> 51:11.701
[man speaking
unintelligibly]

51:12.435 --> 51:13.870
[Furby moaning]

51:17.574 --> 51:18.407
[Taylor] What the hell?

51:21.645 --> 51:23.744
- [man growling]
- [Furby] Wait!

51:23.746 --> 51:25.846
- [Furby] <i>Ah! Help!</i>
- [man grunting]

51:25.848 --> 51:27.014
[Furby] <i>No. No, no, no!</i>

51:27.016 --> 51:29.851

- [man grunting, growling]

51:29.853 --> 51:32.589
- [thumping continues]
- [man grunting]

51:44.868 --> 51:46.503
[Veeves] What just happened?

51:57.913 --> 51:59.415
There's someone in here.

51:59.882 --> 52:01.384
And it's not Hopper.

52:03.219 --> 52:04.085
[sighs]

52:04.087 --> 52:05.488
[Jackie] I'm gonna be sick.

52:14.931 --> 52:17.532
[Cara] Don't worry about me.
Just watch the tunnel.

52:17.534 --> 52:18.900
And, Veeves,
watch for falling rocks.

52:18.902 --> 52:20.101
She's gonna be fine.

52:20.103 --> 52:22.704
But no matter what,
you can't look up, okay?

52:22.706 --> 52:24.908
Thanks. I get it.

52:25.775 --> 52:28.610
[suspenseful music]

52:28.612 --> 52:29.713
[Jackie] You got it, Cara!

52:32.248 --> 52:33.850
[panting]

52:35.819 --> 52:36.884
[Jackie] You got this.
Just take it

52:36.886 --> 52:37.888
a little bit at a time.

52:39.288 --> 52:40.922
[gasps]
[Cara] Oh, my god.

52:40.924 --> 52:42.757
[Jackie] Sorry. I'll shut up.

52:42.759 --> 52:43.761
[Cara] Okay, okay.

52:45.594 --> 52:47.598
[cell phone chimes]

52:49.565 --> 52:50.965
Veeves,

52:50.967 --> 52:51.733
this is exactly what we're
trying to avoid right now.

52:51.735 --> 52:52.567
It's Furby's footage.

52:52.569 --> 52:53.637
[Jackie] Don't watch that.

52:54.705 --> 52:55.936
[Veeves] I noticed
something earlier.

52:55.938 --> 52:57.271
[Jackie] What?

52:57.273 --> 52:58.775
He sees something here. Wait.

53:00.009 --> 53:01.544
[Veeves] You can slow
the playback.

53:03.246 --> 53:04.514
Do you see that?

53:06.750 --> 53:07.648
That, right there.

53:07.650 --> 53:09.284
The sun's path keeps changing.

53:09.286 --> 53:11.786
[Jackie] What?
Why is it doing that?

53:11.788 --> 53:12.790
[Veeves] Oh, my god.

53:13.690 --> 53:14.925
It's not just the sun.

53:15.926 --> 53:18.625
- What?
- It's the seasons.

53:18.627 --> 53:20.696
[Veeves] This thing is the sun
shifting on the horizon.

53:23.299 --> 53:24.166
[Jackie] Oh, my god,
you're right.

53:24.168 --> 53:26.333
That's not just one revolution.

53:26.335 --> 53:27.569
It's hundreds.

53:27.571 --> 53:28.936
Wait, what did she say?

53:28.938 --> 53:31.639
That's why everything
was so different on the surface.

53:31.641 --> 53:33.741
[Veeves] We've been down here
a really long time.

53:33.743 --> 53:35.610
[Cara] What?

53:35.612 --> 53:38.645
Guys, what's going on
down there? What's on the video?

53:38.647 --> 53:39.880
[Jackie] Guys, this is bad.

53:39.882 --> 53:42.317
This is really, really bad.

53:42.319 --> 53:44.117
[Cara] Guys,
what's on the video?

53:44.119 --> 53:46.587
[Taylor] Those are entire years.

53:46.589 --> 53:48.755
It's the solstice, that's the
only thing that makes sense.

53:48.757 --> 53:49.790
[Cara] Seriously?

53:49.792 --> 53:51.728
Each of those is a year,
not a day?

53:52.862 --> 53:54.161
How long is that?

53:54.163 --> 53:56.567
[Jackie] Taylor, we've been
in here for hours.

53:56.967 --> 53:59.000

- [Veeves] Are you okay?

54:16.018 --> 54:17.751
- [Taylor] Come on.
- [Jackie groans]

54:17.753 --> 54:18.788
[Jackie] The hell is that?

54:23.092 --> 54:24.594

54:30.000 --> 54:31.902

54:45.949 --> 54:47.117
Wait, there's something
coming down.

54:49.185 --> 54:50.554
[Jackie] What is that?

54:51.186 --> 54:53.688
That is a giant.

54:53.690 --> 54:54.956
[Veeves] Hurry, hurry, hurry!

54:54.958 --> 54:56.126
[Cara] Veeves, stay back.

54:59.696 --> 55:00.561
[shrieks]

55:00.563 --> 55:01.797
[Taylor] Come on, let's go.

55:03.732 --> 55:04.834
[Jackie] Oh, my god.

55:06.002 --> 55:07.538
I don't wanna go back up.

- [Veeves] How far does it go?

55:55.851 --> 55:57.751
- [Cara] Are you okay?
- [Veeves] Yeah.

55:57.753 --> 55:58.886
[Taylor] We can stay
ahead of him.

55:58.888 --> 56:00.721
His suit looks hard to move in.

56:03.726 --> 56:05.092

56:07.931 --> 56:09.996
I can't... I have to stop.

56:11.134 --> 56:13.067
[Jackie groaning]

56:13.069 --> 56:14.802
[Taylor] I think we lost him.

56:14.804 --> 56:16.003
He's moving pretty slow.

56:16.005 --> 56:16.806
Wait, no, no. Go, go, go!

56:18.208 --> 56:20.741
- [Jackie] Okay!
- [Cara] Go!

56:20.743 --> 56:21.911
[Veeves] It looks like
the ground's wet.

56:27.884 --> 56:28.952

Let's go faster.

56:36.192 --> 56:37.894
[Veeves] I think I see light
up ahead.

56:39.828 --> 56:40.897
Wait, it's fire.

56:42.898 --> 56:44.766
[Jackie] Why is there fire?

56:44.768 --> 56:46.101
Guys, there's someone else
in here.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.835
- [Cara] Veeves, take Jackie.
- [Jackie] Shit. Ow.

[Cara] There's no pulse,
but she's warm.

56:57.514 --> 56:59.514
- [Veeves] She just died.
- [Jackie] Oh, my god.

56:59.516 --> 57:01.215
- What?
- [Jackie] This is Hopper's mom.

57:01.217 --> 57:03.016
[Cara] What?

57:03.018 --> 57:04.787
[Jackie] She's been here
for 40 years.

01:13:56.164 --> 01:13:57.463
[Taylor] He's not that far away.

01:13:57.465 --> 01:13:59.498
I can probably get there

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:02.568
Even if I have to carry him.

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:05.271
[Jackie] Uh... Well, this time,
I'm going with you.

01:14:05.273 --> 01:14:06.540
How long is this supposed
to take?

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.241
My ankle just took seconds.

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.274
[Taylor] All right. Hopefully,

01:14:09.276 --> 01:14:10.844
Furby won't take
that long either.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:12.080
Yeah. That's unlikely.

01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:13.680
Veeves!

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.948

01:14:45.713 --> 01:14:48.014
- Veeves, light it. Let's go!
- Taylor, they're waking up. Run!

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:49.983

[Veeves] Something's really,
really wrong down here too.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.072
What is that? Is that water?

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:48.308

It's a bumpy ride once you break
through the water.

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.543
One at a time.
Veeves, you go in first.

01:18:37.545 --> 01:18:39.181

Oh, man! What about Furby

that we need.
Just hold your breath.
