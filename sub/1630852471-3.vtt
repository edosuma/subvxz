[vocalizing]

00:15.015 --> 00:17.142
-[Tan] Whoa!
-[Jonathan] Wow!

00:17.225 --> 00:21.104
Antoni, did you make us egg tacos?

00:21.187 --> 00:23.064
-Or breakfast tacos, yeah.
-[laughing]

00:23.148 --> 00:25.066
Technically, they're egg tacos.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.527
[accented] Egg tacos.
Don't ya know, there?

00:27.610 --> 00:29.195
[ringing]

00:31.448 --> 00:33.616
-[Tan] We have another dossier.
-[Antoni] Oh, yay!

00:33.700 --> 00:35.160
-[Tan] We filling our faces?
-Yeah.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.870
That means you'll shut up and let me read.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.121
[laughing]

00:38.204 --> 00:40.957
"Our hero this week is Josh Eilers."

00:42.167 --> 00:43.960
Come on, get on in there now. Yep.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.172
My name is Josh. I'm 32 years old,
and I live in Austin, Texas.

00:47.714 --> 00:48.631
Yah!

00:48.715 --> 00:52.385
[Tan] "He's the founder of Ranger Cattle,
a cattle ranch that manages

00:52.469 --> 00:55.805
the production and distribution
of Wagyu beef throughout Texas,

00:55.889 --> 00:59.142
which is very expensive,
the best in the world."

00:59.225 --> 01:00.602
[Antoni] Ooh, we got a cowboy.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.562
You know I love a cowboy so much.
I married one.

01:02.645 --> 01:06.524
What I love most about this ranch
is it gives me a sense of pride.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.151
Come on, now. Yep. [whistles]

01:08.234 --> 01:10.278
And we grow
the most badass beef in Texas.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.282
"He is single, but he was
nominated by his ex-girlfriend Kayla…"

01:14.365 --> 01:15.867
He is the hot mess express…

01:15.950 --> 01:18.953
[chuckles] …and needs some help
in every aspect of his life.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.955
I always say
that he has Peter Pan Syndrome.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.000
[Tan] "…his dream girl who remains
a close friend and business partner."

01:24.084 --> 01:26.586
-Which I think is really interesting.
-[Antoni] Yeah.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.047
Since you're the marketing chair,
you gotta figure out how

01:29.130 --> 01:32.592
to get all of that information
into a picture.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.928
Josh and I used to date, back in the day.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.931
He's so charming,
your total Texas gentleman.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.433
But Josh is flirtatious with other women.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.769
He's very much, like,
a love-'em-and-leave-'em type.

01:42.852 --> 01:46.022
Some of the reasons why I nominated him
are part of why we didn't work out.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.066
But we have since become
really great friends,

01:48.149 --> 01:49.859
and I help him
with marketing at the ranch.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.654
[laughs]

01:52.737 --> 01:54.572
-[Josh] How'd that go?
-You're great.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.742
[Josh] Me and Kayla,
we fell pretty hard for each other.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.327
But I didn't do everything right.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.704
I wasn't the guy she was ready for.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.748
And I think I'll always regret that.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.458
We gotta figure out
what's going on inside

02:05.542 --> 02:07.836
so you can start
to have more flourishing relationships.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.379
Ready. Set…

02:09.462 --> 02:10.755
[sizzles]

02:10.839 --> 02:13.883
It would take an act of God
for me to date Josh again.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.762
I'm never gonna say never, but he really
has to go through some serious changes.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.306
Not just, like, on the outside,
but truly on the inside.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.435
"Prior to raising cattle, he was one
of the youngest rangers in the US Army."

02:24.519 --> 02:26.604
-Good for him.
-No idea you had rangers in the army.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.982
-Does that mean cattle rangers?
-No, Power Rangers.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.860
-They're like "Triceratops!"
-[laughing]

02:31.943 --> 02:35.321
Josh is one of the youngest
army rangers in American history.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.281
He's really humble.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.242
You just wouldn't know right away
that he was a Purple Heart recipient

02:39.325 --> 02:42.662
or that he was injured in battle, and he's
lucky to be here today and tell the tale.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.665
[Tan] "While his military career
instilled structure and discipline,

02:45.748 --> 02:48.877
Josh lacks follow-through
in his romantic relationships."

02:48.960 --> 02:51.921
"He's never taken any of them
seriously until losing Kayla." Ooh!

02:53.214 --> 02:55.425
Josh is charming and wonderful,

02:55.508 --> 02:57.760
but he doesn't shower half the time.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.596
I don't think he wears underwear.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.847
[laughs]

03:01.431 --> 03:03.474
[Josh]
The women definitely prefer me dirty.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.020
A cowboy is not gonna smell,
you know, all pretty and like flowers.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.315
They're gonna smell like a ranch.
That's what women are into.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.692
[Tan] "His philosophy…
who needs to shower or wash your hair

03:12.775 --> 03:14.694
when you can spend
your day working on a ranch?"

03:14.777 --> 03:17.071
-Sounds hot.
-[laughing]

03:17.864 --> 03:20.825
You know, I've put
ten years into this company.

03:20.909 --> 03:25.747
Those young bulls in the Valero pasture,
we need to run that DNA on 'em.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.416
Building it bigger and better
every day of my life.

03:28.499 --> 03:31.294
But I really wanna see
what I can achieve, like, as a man,

03:31.377 --> 03:34.881
as a father, as a role model,
as a leader of a family.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.841
I got goosebumps on that one.

03:36.925 --> 03:40.762
"Josh admits his biological clock
is ticking and knows he needs to grow up

03:40.845 --> 03:44.140
and fine-tune his lifestyle in order
to live his dream of being a father."

03:44.224 --> 03:47.518
Yes! Men applying biological
pressure to themselves to reproduce.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.230
-It's about time, honey. Yes!
-[laughing]

03:50.313 --> 03:54.400
"Let's help this wannabe husband
so he can lasso the love of his life."

03:54.484 --> 03:57.445
[all cheering]

03:57.528 --> 04:01.115
I'm gonna change so I can be a little
less Hugh Hefner and a little more cowboy.

I do love cows.
I think they're so beautiful.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.185
Especially when the fat
is beautifully marbled.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.270

04:30.353 --> 04:33.606
I do not enjoy going to ranches, cattles…

04:36.693 --> 04:37.944
Oh, hello.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.822
[Antoni] Is that him?
Aww, look at the cattle.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.241
I think I'm carrying
one of their cousins in my purse.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.201
-Oh, my God, there's a baby one!
-[Bobby] Aww!

04:45.285 --> 04:46.119

04:46.202 --> 04:48.413
Bobby, do not make out with any cows.

Hey, hold these, Walker.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.506
-Hello!
-I don't know if we should yell.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.551
-[Tan] You're not to yell around cows?
-[Bobby] Not at them, no.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.760
Hi, cows.

05:02.844 --> 05:03.928
Oh, hello.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.596
-Hi!
-Just give me one second.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.931
Okay.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.182
Hey, spin her around.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.892
Bring her back. Bring her back.

05:10.518 --> 05:14.230
-Let us know when you're ready. Peace.
-[chuckles] All right, give me one second.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.650
We're here. We're queer.
Forget about the cows.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.776
How are you guys?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.570
Is that a beer? Isn't it ten o'clock?

05:20.653 --> 05:24.157
Yeah, but we start early so, like,
the whole noon rule doesn't count here.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.785
I was not expecting the voice.

05:27.869 --> 05:31.080
Usually, we try to be
up and rolling by five. Yeah.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.082
He naturally speaks
like Matthew McConaughey.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.793
These are Wagyu cattle.
We'll breed 'em in a couple days.

I'm thinking… [imitates McConaughey]
…"All right, all right, all right."

05:38.713 --> 05:40.006
[chuckles] Yeah.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.090
[Karamo] Is it peeing?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.217
-Yes, that's what animals do.
-[Antoni] Karamo.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.137
-This one's what they call a city slicker.
-I couldn't tell.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.347
[laughing]

05:47.430 --> 05:51.309
If you all could smell
what I smell right now…

05:51.392 --> 05:52.518
[groans]

05:52.602 --> 05:55.063
…you would understand
why Josh don't got a girlfriend.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.939
Your hair is so pretty.

05:57.023 --> 06:01.402
This beard. This hair. This face, honey.
You are working it. Yes!

06:01.986 --> 06:02.820
All right.

06:02.904 --> 06:06.074
-Oh, my golly, Moses.
-[Antoni] That is a big boy.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.869
-He's excited to have someone in there.
-[Antoni] He likes the attention. Like me.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.371

06:11.454 --> 06:13.289
This bull's got some big…

06:13.373 --> 06:14.457

…bull stuff.

-How about you show us where you sleep?
-That was a segue.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.297
[Bobby and Josh laughing]

06:21.381 --> 06:23.341
Here, walk through
this grass right over here.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.717
Is there gonna be snakes?

06:24.801 --> 06:26.094
[Josh] No, there's no snakes.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.096
-Man, this is wild.
-[Antoni] What's wild about it?

06:28.179 --> 06:29.806
We're in a very conservative state.

06:29.889 --> 06:33.226
Raising beef cattle is probably
the most conservative industry.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.771
Just judging by the looks of you guys,
I don't think y'all are conservative.

06:36.854 --> 06:40.441
-So, it's not what we're used to here.
-Is it my open, exposed shoulders?

06:40.525 --> 06:41.901
[all laughing]

06:41.984 --> 06:45.947

show up here on a daily basis?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.490
[laughing continues]

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
Clearly, they do not.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.495
This is the feed barn.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.832
[Josh] Yeah, yeah.
It's barley, cottonseed, corn.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.084
-You were gonna show us where you sleep.
-I sleep here.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.504
-[Fab Five] Oh!
-[Josh] Up in the shipping.

07:01.587 --> 07:05.049
I was, like, looking over there.
I'm like, wait, where? Ah!

07:05.133 --> 07:09.762
He lives over these three mounds
that smell incredibly bad.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.681
[Bobby] This is where
you invite ladies to?

07:11.764 --> 07:14.642
She's like,
"I have to get up early tomorrow."

07:14.725 --> 07:17.353
-[Josh] Watch your step. Come on in.
-[Jonathan] Oh, God.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.774
[Bobby] This is headquarters?
Or housing? Or…

07:21.858 --> 07:23.443
This is what we call the living quarters.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.237
[Tan] Did it come as this,
or did you turn it into this?

07:26.320 --> 07:27.572
[Josh] We turned it into this.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.614
Are y'all seeing this?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.616
[Jonathan] You gotta
loosen it up a little.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.704
Jesus, take the wheel and drive
this shipping container far, far away.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.914
[Josh] People say,
"Oh, you live in a trailer."

07:36.998 --> 07:38.833
There's no wheels. It's not a trailer.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.002
It's giving me, like,
maybe hazardously built.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.297
Like, is it safe? Is it "secure"?

07:45.548 --> 07:47.091
Is this house moving?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.176
[Antoni] What's this?

07:48.259 --> 07:49.844
It's all cattle-rancher stuff.

07:49.927 --> 07:53.389
Where are, like, the personal books?
The journals?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.266
Oh, my God, he's got a flat iron.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.601
Chili Cook-Off…

07:57.768 --> 07:59.395
Candlelight Chili Cook-Off…

08:02.023 --> 08:05.276
I don't think
he's dusted in here in years.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.360
[Bobby] Let's go in here.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.322
An empty printer ink cartridge,
he's like my dad.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.699
Oh, my God, his Christmas stocking!

08:11.782 --> 08:14.535
-[Antoni] That's cute, he likes dogs.
-Even that's dirty.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.120
[Antoni] I like the dream catcher.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.289
I like when you open a closet
and bugs fly out.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.665
-That's nice.
-[Josh] Thank you.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.710
[Tan] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
this is where you sleep?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.504
-[Josh] Yeah.
-How do we have sex on this?

08:24.587 --> 08:27.924
[Josh] I don't think we will have sex
on this. Y'all might have sex on this.

08:28.007 --> 08:31.010
-No, we're not having sex on that.
-[Bobby] No, we don't have sex together.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.262
-[Antoni] Hey, stereotypes.
-[Jonathan] He's married.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.682
Can you imagine trying
to have any kind of… [clicks tongue]

08:36.766 --> 08:38.518
…on this bunk bed? No.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.645
And the bed's not made!

08:41.270 --> 08:45.525
It sounds like this provided what
you needed for that stage in your life.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.528
-Absolutely.
-If you're wanting to start a new stage…

08:48.611 --> 08:50.488
-Wife, family…
-[Josh] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:50.571 --> 08:54.408
This won't cut it for that stage.
Your cradle right here, the dog…

08:54.492 --> 08:56.869
-It's not quite a three-bedroom.
-Three-bedroom with a view.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.412
-[laughs] Yeah.
-With a view of feed.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.414
[Antoni] Wow!

09:00.498 --> 09:03.626
These have mold on them.
I didn't know marshmallows can go old.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.671
[chuckles] What's
Brucella abortus vaccine?

09:06.754 --> 09:09.131
Next to a nice '98 Cabernet.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.342
This is what
my mom would call a death trap!

09:11.425 --> 09:13.511
-[Jonathan] Let's go into your bathroom.
-[Bobby] God!

09:13.594 --> 09:15.263
I almost fell off these stairs!

09:15.346 --> 09:16.305
Stay to the right.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.850
[Jonathan] How much time
are you willing to spend?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.102
-Getting ready?
-Yeah.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.395
Oh, I mean, like, five minutes.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.938
Great! Five minutes is plenty for me.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.690
Once you wake up and you're moving,

09:25.773 --> 09:28.401
you're wasting time if you're not working
or getting something done.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.028
I like to just get my hair wet,
because otherwise, it 'fros out.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.240
-Yeah, 'cause you've got very curly hair.
-Very curly, very curly, like, yeah.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.033
I must admit,
I kind of like the long hair.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.702
I like your long hair too.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.621
-Thanks, man. I appreciate that.
-You were in the army, weren't you?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.415
-Yeah.
-And that was, like, high and tight…

09:42.498 --> 09:46.294
Exactly, so for five years, I couldn't
have my hair longer than this, you know?

09:46.377 --> 09:49.380
-But will I even have hair at 42?
-That's why I have long hair.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.382
'Cause genetically,
I feel like I'm gonna lose it.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.884
I know. Me too, man.
I feel like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.845
Is there anything
that you're curious about?

09:55.928 --> 09:57.221
Well, I'm a little bit nervous.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.180
For what?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.891
Well, y'all are slightly more
than I was ready for this morning.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.436
It's not what kind of walks
into the ranch every day.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.313
Which'll be nice. We're gonna have fun.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.898
It's a whole lot of trust
going into you guys, so…

10:07.982 --> 10:09.900
I'm gonna wax your eyebrows off,
shave your head…

10:09.984 --> 10:12.361
-Great.
-Kidding. I'm not doing those things.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.864
-Well, I'm excited. [laughs]
-Me too! Yeah!

10:14.947 --> 10:17.241
Oh, jeez. We'll see how it goes. Yeah.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.037
Bobby, if you kiss another damn cow,

10:21.120 --> 10:23.205
I am not playing with your ass.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.750
[speaking gibberish]

10:25.833 --> 10:27.627
[Jonathan] I wanna tell you about Tan.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.421
His waist-to-ass ratio has really…

10:30.504 --> 10:33.007
-His waist is tiny. This ass is fat.
-[Tan] Tiny.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.718
This is what we're gonna do for you
before the week is done.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.263
Yes, we are gonna put the emphasis
on the butt, with a high-waisted jean.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.724
That's what you wanted, right?
Crop top, high-waisted jean?

10:41.807 --> 10:44.894
-Anyway, I'll let you guys talk about it.
-[all laughing]

10:44.977 --> 10:47.897
-Are you doing all right?
-Oh, yeah. Wow, you guys are a lot.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.940
-I'm the normal one. Mano a mano?
-Yeah, all right.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.901
-Yeah.
-What do you really want from your life?

10:51.984 --> 10:56.072
When I'm, like, an old man,
I have grandkids,

10:56.155 --> 11:00.993
and that I was able to raise
good children who raised good children.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.287
You literally have the dream I wanted.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.248
I'm expecting my first child,
which we're very, very excited about.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.625
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.834
I see the look of confusion.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.921
It's the same look that my brother-in-laws
who live on a ranch also had.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.006
It's called a surrogacy process.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.758
Somebody's carrying our baby.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.927
-That is cool.
-I felt exactly like you did.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.512
I'm just ready for that next step.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.847
Pull out what you would wear on a date.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.183
Yeah, we always do
a heavy starch on the jeans.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.894
'Cause I think if you have
a crease in a jean, it's kind of classy.

11:26.977 --> 11:27.853
Yo, wait.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.815
That is not just a heavy starch.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.650
-That is cardboard.
-Yeah.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.278
I could literally bend that, not fold it.
That's insane.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.906
So what you want,
when you pull it, you wanna hear it.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.534
[laughs] What<i> you</i> want.
That's definitely not what I want.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.536
-[laughs]
-[Tan] That's insane.

11:43.619 --> 11:48.624
-Yeah.
-He has his jeans starched so much

11:49.208 --> 11:53.129
that you literally have
to bend them and crack them apart.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.547
You find that comfortable?

11:54.630 --> 11:58.092
I think I do.
And it's just a classic cowboy.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.176
[Tan] That is nuts.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.888
I don't understand
the reason for cardboard jeans.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.724
You're not showering very often.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.809
I just think humans
shower too much in general.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.103
-Okay, let me give you an example.
-Yeah.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.731
-You take this girl on a date.
-All right.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.190
You go home with her.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.986
She takes her clothes off,
and she stinks to high hell.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.071
See where I'm going?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.448
-Can I counter this?
-Please.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.409
What if you never once
got a complaint on any of that, ever?

12:23.492 --> 12:26.579
People are usually too kind
to say, "Hey, you smell."

12:26.662 --> 12:28.164
And what about pheromones?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.165
No woman is thinking,

12:29.248 --> 12:32.334
"Ooh, I can't wait to get to him
because he smells like this."

12:32.418 --> 12:34.420
And then, the hair.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.546
The hair.

12:35.629 --> 12:40.009
His hair is just really,
really, really greasy.

12:40.092 --> 12:45.347
Like I've never ever seen
such greasy hair in my life.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.390
You're a stinky boy.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.309
And what do we do with stinky boys?

12:48.392 --> 12:50.603
Tan and Antoni
are going to wash your hair.

12:50.686 --> 12:51.979
-Now.
-Okay.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.023
Do a wet t-shirt contest.
Take your top off.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.233
-[Tan] No, don't take your top off.
-Oh, what?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.611
-Is there any fresh towels?
-Yeah, right there.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.113
-[Tan] We're claiming that as fresh.
-I'm not gonna smell it.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.865
[Tan] He's gonna put a towel around you.

13:02.948 --> 13:03.866
Like this?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.743
[Tan] You can come all the way up here.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.454
[Jonathan] So, Tan, make sure
you wash down to his scalp.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.164
-Get his roots.
-[Tan] You know I will.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.458
-[Josh] Oh, wow.
-[Tan] It does feel nice. I know it does.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.251
Oh, my God, shoot the bottom!

13:14.335 --> 13:15.795
-It's all brown!
-[Antoni] Whoa!

13:15.878 --> 13:16.921
[Josh] Pretty dramatic.

13:17.004 --> 13:21.050
-That's not dramatic. That's brown water!
-Your hair is brown.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.093
There's cow shit in your scalp, honey.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.554
That's honestly a <i>Queer Eye</i> first.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.640
Did you see the dirt
that came out of that shit?

13:27.723 --> 13:28.641
[Josh] Oh, yeah.

13:28.724 --> 13:32.645
-See, liberals can be fun!
-[all laughing]

13:33.229 --> 13:36.148
-You are beautiful.
-[Tan] Doesn't that feel nice?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.566
[Jonathan] You're a model.

13:37.650 --> 13:41.403
I don't remember the last time
I saw someone's hair run brown

13:41.487 --> 13:43.531
that didn't have
brown hair color in their hair.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.116
Yes. Have you ever loved yourself more?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.536
-[Josh] I think a couple of times.
-[all laughing]

13:48.619 --> 13:51.121
-[Antoni] I wanna see the kitchen.
-[Josh] Okay, let's go.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.707
So, we built
a tasting room right up the hill.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.169
-Do you wanna carry me or no?
-[Josh] No, I'm pretty good.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.380
[Jonathan] I just wanted to make sure.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.465
-[Josh] Let me show you around a bit.
-[Antoni] Yeah.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.885
We have that retail counter here.
If you want a steak, you can come in.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.720
Then we've got somewhat of a kitchen.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.514
-This is a great kitchen!
-It's cool, huh?

14:08.597 --> 14:10.266
[Antoni] How many days a week
you eat steak?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.810
Most days. I'll try
to throw in chicken every now and then,

14:12.893 --> 14:14.895
but not when anyone's watching.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.147
-[Antoni] When nobody's watching?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.526
-Oh, masculinity.
-Meat and potatoes is where it's at.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.361
-Meat and potatoes?
-Best meal in the world.

14:22.444 --> 14:26.031
The best beef would probably be
a New York Strip, super marbled.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.992
Well, that's the point of Wagyu,

14:28.075 --> 14:30.244
and of eating that
is that it's perfectly marbled.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.955
-And what about vegetables?
-I just don't like 'em, you know?

14:33.038 --> 14:35.416
-I hear they're healthy, but--
-It's a rumor.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.876
You know what I mean? [laughs]

14:36.959 --> 14:39.336
-You need more veggies in your life.
-They're not delicious.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.838
If it were good, I would eat it.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.257
How did your mom make veggies
for you growing up.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.886
Mom was a pretty good Texan woman
and didn't feed me a whole lot of veggies.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.013
-[laughing]
-[Josh] You know?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.850
Can you tell me about your time
in the service?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.727
I joined the military when I was 17.

14:54.810 --> 14:57.021
Probably sooner than I really should have.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.856
-Yeah.
-I wasn't quite grown up.

14:58.939 --> 15:03.277
My old man told me that
the military is run by a bunch of kids.

15:03.360 --> 15:08.115
I had no clue what that meant until I was
a 20-year-old team leader in Afghanistan

15:08.198 --> 15:10.534
leading men into combat.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.911
That is bizarre.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.829
-But that taught you leadership.
-Yeah.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.999
But I also remember me being 17
is where I also learned how

15:17.082 --> 15:20.544
to, like, be a little bit more responsible
in some of the areas that weren't work.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.756
Where I learned how to,
like, be a better boyfriend,

15:23.839 --> 15:25.841
how to groom myself, how to find my look.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.801
-Yeah.
-Those are the moments where I found that.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.762
Do you feel like
you missed out on those moments?

15:29.845 --> 15:30.888
I think massively.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.558
I went straight
from the military to college,

15:34.642 --> 15:36.477
but I wasn't really just in college.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.854
I was starting this company
at the same time.

15:38.938 --> 15:43.317
You said that your ex Kayla
was the right woman at the wrong time.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.360
-What happened?
-Yeah.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.446
We had plans of, like,
getting married and stuff.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.490
And then, once the added pressures

15:49.573 --> 15:52.493
of, like, the company spiraling downhill
because of the pandemic,

15:52.576 --> 15:56.330
um, she started seeing, you know,
all my shortcomings pretty quick.

15:56.413 --> 16:00.542
So, it didn't last very long. You know,
I think we only dated a few months.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.170
And, um, it's a weight on my heart.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.880
It's like, aww, I let the one go

16:04.964 --> 16:07.675
because I wasn't right
in my head at the right time.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.969
And I don't think I did
a very good job of that.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.013
-Yeah, that's pretty honest to say.
-Yeah, yeah.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.473
[Karamo] Yeah.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.141
-Hey, boos.
-Hey!

16:16.725 --> 16:17.893
I just made him uncomfortable.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.603
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.023
This is the first time
you've been around five queer people.

16:23.107 --> 16:23.941
That you know of.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.651
-Is it-- Yes.
-That I know of, yeah.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.279
[Tan] Are we feeling like
we can make this work this week?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.907
We're gonna understand who we are,
understand each other.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.659
If you guys are
the experts you say you are…

16:33.742 --> 16:37.079
I feel like "expert's" been used
loosely for me before. Like, you know…

16:37.162 --> 16:38.497
[Tan] How are we feeling?

16:38.580 --> 16:42.084
We feel good. I think we can make some
progress and head in the right direction.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.752
-I think so too!
-Hey!

16:43.836 --> 16:46.422
-[Tan] So, we all feeling good about this?
-Yeah, Tanny!

16:46.505 --> 16:48.340
-[Tan] Let's do it.
-[Antoni] Whoo!

16:51.385 --> 16:55.055
I'd like to think that Josh is
more than wine and marshmallows.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.100
We need to introduce Josh
to the other four food groups,

16:58.183 --> 16:59.560
other than meat.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.315
I want Josh to understand
that I'm not trying to turn him into me.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.736
I want him to be
just the best version of himself.

17:08.819 --> 17:13.282
Josh enlisted so early, that I think there
was areas that he stopped growing in.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.618
It's time for him
to start to grow in other ways,

17:16.702 --> 17:19.621
if he really wants
to have a family one day.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.751
We're upcycling a used shipping container.
We're putting three French doors here.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.252
I wanted to give him a new space,

17:25.335 --> 17:28.380
'cause right now
his home does not scream "ready."

17:28.464 --> 17:30.549
It screams "run."

17:30.632 --> 17:34.261
People are like, "Oh, well, a metal box,
that's gotta be so hot to live in."

17:34.344 --> 17:36.555
[man] If you insulate it correctly,
it feels great.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.016
[Bobby] And it'll last way longer
than traditional buildings.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.311
Yeah, a shipping container will last
up to 100 years if you treat it properly.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.397
From a hair-health perspective,
not overwashing your hair is amazing.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.108
But, like, there's no
deep cleaning going on here.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.152
I've got my work cut out for me.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.237
[dance music playing]

17:53.989 --> 17:57.910
<i>♪ DJ, turn it up so we can get started ♪</i>

18:00.829 --> 18:02.081
[Jonathan] Hi!

18:02.164 --> 18:04.249
-[Josh] Hey, I'm Josh Eilers.
-Nice to meet you.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.044
-Toni.
-Nice to meet you. Oh, welcome in.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.254
That was so Texan and, like, gentlemanly.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.798
-You took your hat off.
-[laughing]

18:10.881 --> 18:13.884
-That was the cutest thing I've ever seen.
-Really? All right.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.427
Do you do that regularly?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.263
-Yeah, yes, sir, yeah. Quite a bit.
-Oh, my God. Okay, take a seat.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.683
Tell me, do you wanna
take care of your hair more?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.478
[Josh] I don't think I really know
how to take care of the hair more.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.731
One, no one really
teaches men how to care for hair.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.944
And two, I've never had it before.
So, it's been kind of an experiment.

18:32.027 --> 18:35.322
I was originally thinking that
I wanted to cut your hair shorter.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.032
But you have a great hairline.

18:37.116 --> 18:41.537
And I do vibe with, like, you're
not gonna have the rest of your life

18:41.620 --> 18:43.539
to have, like,
really long hair if you lose it.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.499
I've been on Propecia
since I was, like, 19,

18:45.582 --> 18:47.751
'cause everyone in my family's,
like, lost their hair.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.838
And I really don't wanna lose mine.
So, I very much, you know, feel like

18:50.921 --> 18:53.632
I wanna have long hair until
I don't have a hairline to support it.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.551
I do think it needs
a little bit of a shape.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.346
This can read a little bit Lord Farquaad,
from <i>Shrek</i>.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.723
-Okay.
-Not really trying to do that.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.185
Oh, also, I'm gonna do this other thing.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.730
I really feel like we need
to put a few highlights in your hair.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.815
But just, like, five.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.775
-Color?
-[Jonathan] Yes.

19:12.276 --> 19:16.321
You're screaming, "I need to be let out
of this misogynistic, repressive box!"

19:16.905 --> 19:20.075
"I need to have a few highlights,
so that I can let my texture sing!"

19:20.159 --> 19:22.286
-Do whatever you want.
-Come on, let's wash your hair.

19:22.369 --> 19:27.416
The only thing I know how to do
to get this man out of his comfort zone

19:27.499 --> 19:29.376
is to give him balayage highlights,

19:29.459 --> 19:32.379
a full facial and a manicure,
all before ten in the morning.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.464
Have you ever had
a gorgeous clip in your hair?

19:34.548 --> 19:35.799
-[Josh] No.
-[laughs]

19:35.883 --> 19:38.177
-That's a first.
-We're gonna do lots of firsts today.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.094
Great.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.764
Because I need to shake…
him out of his comfort zone.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.643
-Are you excited? It's our first--
-I'm a little bit nervous, but yeah.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.395
Why are you nervous, hon?

19:49.563 --> 19:52.983
Well, I think this is, uh, an environment
I've never really been in, you know?

19:53.066 --> 19:55.485
What do you want
from this experience, overall?

19:55.569 --> 19:56.987
You know, I've always said that

19:57.070 --> 20:02.159
if different people could just
sit down and share a beer and talk,

20:02.242 --> 20:04.661
like, they'd find out they'll have
a whole lot more in common

20:04.745 --> 20:06.371
-than they have different.
-Uh-huh.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.124
You know, things like the shoes.
Man, what's that about?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.877
Cute, right? I mean,
What's up with your cowboy boots?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.962
-There's heels on those.
-A little bit.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.756
[Jonathan] It's the difference
of two inches.

20:15.839 --> 20:19.426
So normally, I think I would see you
walking down the street, I'd be like,

20:19.509 --> 20:21.386
"Man, that guy's just weird."

20:21.470 --> 20:22.971
So, I identify as non-binary.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.433
-What's that mean?
-It means that I don't identify as a man.

20:26.516 --> 20:30.479
Okay. So, what is
the polite way to address you?

20:30.562 --> 20:32.439
My pronouns are he/she/they.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.316
But typically,
when someone's non-binary,

20:34.399 --> 20:37.486
like you would not wanna say, like,
"sir" or, like, "man."

20:37.569 --> 20:38.528
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.405
If you're ever unsure,
you can totally ask.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.783
Then it's okay to ask?
Like, nobody gets offended?

20:42.866 --> 20:45.035
No, but I mean,
also I'll tell you that, like,

20:45.118 --> 20:48.830
that's all a language I didn't really have
until I was in my 30s.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.625
-Uh-huh.
-So, it's normal that people don't know.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.211
Well, and I think, like,
a big part of me is that

20:54.294 --> 20:56.171
I always wanna be super polite, you know?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.090
-Yeah.
-I never wanna hurt anybody's feelings.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.050
[Jonathan] I want
to spend enough time with Josh

21:00.133 --> 21:02.010
to make him realize
that gender's a construct.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.596
So, how old were you when you came out?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.348
Oh, well, I was pretty young.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.518
If you imagine me as,
like, a six-year-old, I was like…

21:09.601 --> 21:11.603
[laughs] You know?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.355
Exactly like I am now, but younger.

21:13.438 --> 21:17.401
And he can be around different people,
because a lot of people wear heels.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.986
[Josh] So these are the highlights?

21:19.069 --> 21:22.072
[Jonathan] Yep.
It's a French technique called balayage,

21:22.155 --> 21:23.657
which means to sweep.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.910
It just looks
a little more natural than a foil.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.622
That is pretty.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.585
[Josh] You know what my goal is
by the end of the day?

21:35.669 --> 21:37.629
-Yes.
-Be your first Republican friend.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.299
[Jonathan] Oh, yeah, well, you are.
Have you ever seen <i>Pretty Woman?</i>

21:40.382 --> 21:43.343
-[Josh] Yeah, yeah! That's a classic.
<i>-</i>This is gonna be your beauty montage.

21:48.598 --> 21:52.185
-[woman] You ever had your nails done?
-No, ma'am. This is my first time.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.980
Usually, I just clean out the dirt
with a pocketknife, you know?

21:55.063 --> 21:57.357
-[Jonathan] Oh, my God.
-[Josh] It works surprisingly well.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.818
[woman laughs]

21:59.901 --> 22:01.778
[Jonathan] You are living your best life.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.155
Oh, it is perfect.

22:03.238 --> 22:06.783
I want you to, like,
show me the products to use

22:06.867 --> 22:10.162
so I don't… around
with getting the wrong stuff.

22:10.245 --> 22:13.373
-You know, 'cause I'll take it serious.
-I love that about you.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.792
Did that feel relaxing and gorgeous?

22:15.876 --> 22:16.918
[Josh] That felt good.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.921
Good. We're just
gonna do a classic countdown.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.841
We go three, we go two, and…

22:22.924 --> 22:24.259
There's a new Josh.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.723
Definitely feels cleaner.
Wow. Can I touch it?

22:29.806 --> 22:31.433
[Jonathan] Yeah, get all up in there.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.559
I'm very relieved.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.019
I was partially super scared,

22:34.102 --> 22:36.521
you know, those highlights
were gonna be bright purple.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.982
[Jonathan] On the root,
I, like, made it your natural color.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.693
-So, it's not, like, super blended.
-Gotcha, gotcha, yeah.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.278
-[Jonathan] I did good, right?
-Yeah.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.697
-I'm impressed.
-Ah!

22:45.781 --> 22:47.407
You are looking stunning.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.367
[Josh] Thank you.

22:48.450 --> 22:52.954
When have you ever felt
more gorgeous than you do right now?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.831
-Never. Thanks to you.
-Thank you.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.418
I think we should just do a tiny hug.
It's okay.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.836
-All right.
-Okay, come on.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.089

23:02.172 --> 23:04.591

23:04.674 --> 23:05.675
[Bobby] It's a cool place.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.137
They do a lot of woodworking,
CNC routing, make their own furniture…

23:09.221 --> 23:10.055
[Josh] All right.

23:10.138 --> 23:13.183
[Bobby] So, I thought it would be cool
to make a family crest for you.

23:13.266 --> 23:16.478
Your family name actually means warrior.
So, it's a warrior shield.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.105
-I love that.
-[Bobby] Good.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.940
Josh has been talking
about starting a family.

23:20.023 --> 23:24.403
So, I want to give him the physical
manifestation of leaving a legacy.

23:24.486 --> 23:25.779
And that's a family crest.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.030
Shield's gonna look like this.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.741
Your family name
is what's at the very top.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.077
-The lightning bolt from the Rangers.
-Yeah, absolutely.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.621
It represents who you are, who you were.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.207
But the thing that
stands out to me the most

23:37.290 --> 23:40.460
is one of the two of these,
'cause it's an oak tree.

23:40.544 --> 23:44.423
What I like about it is
I saw tons of these on your property.

23:44.506 --> 23:48.009
And not only does it represent
your land and what you're building,

23:48.093 --> 23:50.720
it represents growth and family tree.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.265
-Yeah, no, I love it.
-Good. Which one do you like best?

23:53.348 --> 23:54.599
-I like the tree.
-Yeah.

23:55.308 --> 23:59.521
I'm big into the past, right?
But I'm really into the future.

23:59.604 --> 24:03.483
And so, I think to be able to build
something that will pass down is a gift.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.736
It's incredible. It gives me
something to look forward to, you know?

24:06.820 --> 24:09.364
Something exciting. Something
that's built sturdy and out of wood.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.908
[Bobby] This will be
a great family heirloom to hand down.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.202
-I'm excited about it.
-Good. I'm glad you like it.

24:25.005 --> 24:28.258
-[Josh] So where are we at?
-[Tan] We are at a place called Estilo.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.469
I know that you have
a way that you dress already.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.471
-But we're gonna change it up slightly.
-Mm-hmm.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.763
-After you.
-All right.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.142
A little bit nervous about
walking into here. Just looking around.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.143
[both laugh]

24:38.226 --> 24:41.146
-What is it that makes you nervous?
-Just not something I'm used to.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.732
[Tan] Are there certain clothes
that you're seeing that you like?

24:43.815 --> 24:44.941
It doesn't feel quite right?

24:45.025 --> 24:47.819
No, but I'm sure if I put it on,
I could tell you pretty quick.

24:47.903 --> 24:51.156
Well, you had said, "Well, you guys
are the experts, let's see what you do."

24:51.239 --> 24:53.366
And so you have to give me a chance today.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.660
-I see sneakers on the table.
-I'm not doing sneakers.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.580
-'Cause we gotta meet in the middle.
-We're gonna meet in the middle.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.457
-Like, I think it looks--
-Chic as…

25:00.540 --> 25:03.793
It looks great on you, and it's probably
a fashion icon, but it ain't me.

25:03.877 --> 25:10.008
Josh doesn't want to be seen as
anything other than a masculine rancher.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.135
I think that he's very much concerned

25:12.219 --> 25:14.971
about being seen
as even slightly effeminate.

25:15.055 --> 25:19.059
I wanna show you that you can be stylish
without anybody thinking, "Oh, he's gay."

25:19.142 --> 25:21.645
-Just look good.
-Just look good and play with clothes--

25:21.728 --> 25:23.271
-And impress the lady.
-Yeah.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.691
So, I'll still keep you in denim,
so it still feels like Josh.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.235
[Josh] I appreciate that. Yeah, yeah.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.153
But just a slightly different cut.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.947
Instead of T-shirts,

25:32.030 --> 25:34.950
Henleys have got a little bit of detail,
where the girl's like,

25:35.033 --> 25:36.535
"Okay, he's not just put a T-shirt on.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.411
He's got something
a little more interesting--"

25:38.495 --> 25:39.704
Show some chest hair.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.039
-[Tan] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i>-</i>Okay.

25:41.122 --> 25:44.501
And they're not gonna be massive on you.
I want them to be relatively fitted.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.545
You're in shape.
Why don't we show off the goods?

25:46.628 --> 25:50.674
So, I wanna show you different versions
of-- I know. We're gonna try it.

25:50.757 --> 25:54.135
I wanna know why you hate
something like this so much.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.471
Like, when I put
my boots on in the morning,

25:56.555 --> 25:59.516
I think about, like, my ancestors
that have put on boots.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.433
Okay.

26:00.517 --> 26:04.020
My father, my grandfather,
generations of Texans.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.188
-Okay.
-[groans]

26:05.272 --> 26:07.065
Any of my ancestors ever put that on…

26:07.148 --> 26:09.859
So it's more than just the looks of it.
It's like, that is how…

26:09.943 --> 26:11.945
-[Tan] "That's my heritage."
-That is my home.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.863
-But also…
-[groans]

26:13.947 --> 26:17.617
There weren't options like this available
when your grandfather was young.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.535
-For example.
-Yeah.

26:18.618 --> 26:22.789
So, I've set aside a look in here for you.
Give me a shout if you need help at all.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.874
I'm trying to be so respectful

26:24.958 --> 26:28.712
by giving him
the most conservative clothes I can find,

26:28.795 --> 26:31.172
but an upgrade to what he's worn before.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.633
[Josh] I actually don't hate the boots.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.678
But I'm worried about everything else
because it's so tight.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.097
I'm gonna sweat through this
in about 12 minutes.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.640
You can see my pecker.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.059
-You can't. I promise you can't.
-I see it in the mirror.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.894
-You cannot.
-Oh, my-- Yeah.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.771
Like, I don't even have a belt here.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.150
But even this,
he seems so resistant to it.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.736
-Do you always wear a belt?
-Every day.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.904
To hold your pants up,
or you just like the look?

26:54.988 --> 26:56.489
[Josh] I got a lot of pride in my belt.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.867
If you work for the ranch for ten years,
you get a buckle.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.452
-That means a lot to us.
-Okay.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.871
-So, do I tuck it in?
-Yeah, just in the front.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.290
It's different, man.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.000
There's no doubt it's different.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.045
Forget that it's different. Do you think,
"He looks like an attractive man"?

27:10.128 --> 27:12.631
[Josh] Right now, no.
I think I look like a golfer.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.594
Is the thing that's
throwing it off the shirt?

27:17.677 --> 27:20.305
-The shirt's throwing it off.
-We're gonna change it. Real quick.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.936
-What do you think?
-What do you think?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.813
This one feels a whole lot better.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.690
-I feel like I can breathe.
-Okay.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.151
-This material breathes.
-Great.

27:33.234 --> 27:35.695
Do I think this is the right size for you?

27:35.779 --> 27:37.530
Personally, I don't.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.200
-You see this? This is the shoulder seam.
-Yeah.

27:40.283 --> 27:42.702
-If you push real hard, you can feel…
-This should be up there?

27:42.786 --> 27:43.787
It should be here.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.665
You know what's kind of annoying?

27:47.248 --> 27:49.417
I don't often like to admit I'm wrong.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.294
But, uh, now I'm looking at this shirt,

27:51.378 --> 27:53.963
and I'm like,
seeing it might be a little bit baggy.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.006
-Sure is.
-Little bit.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.841
-Do you want to try the large?
-Let's try it.

27:56.925 --> 28:00.011
[Tan] It's nice to see
that he's starting to finally see

28:00.095 --> 28:02.722
that he can look good
and still feel "masculine"

28:02.806 --> 28:04.974
and still feel like a rancher.

28:05.058 --> 28:08.395
But that doesn't mean that he can't
feel good about what he's wearing.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.021
What do you think on this one?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.314
-So much better.
-Really?

28:11.398 --> 28:13.566
Already, that's getting closer
to your shoulder.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.402
Yeah, it's getting closer to the shoulder.

28:15.485 --> 28:19.322
The baggy thing you were in before
makes your arms look skinny, like noodles.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.866
Whereas this actually shows off your arms.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.369
I actually don't hate this. Huh.

28:24.452 --> 28:28.164
[laughs] I'll take that.
That's a big compliment, I know.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.708
[Josh] Yeah, honestly, I feel great.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.418
I'm just nervous about…

28:31.501 --> 28:32.627
Tell me. The legs?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.629
Accepted by other cowboys
and stuff like that.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.716
Like, if I roll out to a ranch today
and I'm looking like this…

28:37.799 --> 28:40.385
Wear whatever you wear on the ranch,
it doesn't bother me.

28:40.468 --> 28:44.139
Outside of the ranch, when you're trying
to impress the girls, not the guys,

28:44.222 --> 28:46.057
go for something
that's gonna impress the girls.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.810
This is a guy who's not
just obsessed with his work.

28:48.893 --> 28:53.106
He understands that there's a life
that's equally as important. His family.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.608
I actually really appreciate that.

-Boring.
-No, we're not here for boring.

delicious Wagyu beef every day.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.310
[chuckles] The last time
you had a carrot was

29:30.393 --> 29:32.645
when you were actually feeding it
to a horse, not yourself?

29:32.729 --> 29:35.690

-Right. Okay.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.275

29:43.656 --> 29:45.241
-[Josh] I got that.
-Watch your fingers…

29:45.325 --> 29:49.537
Perfect. I'm gonna put in a little
knob of butter, about a tablespoon.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.748
-Uh-huh.
-Olive oil is my go-to.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.082
I'm gonna swirl it around my pan

29:53.166 --> 29:55.543
just to kind of get an even coating
around the whole thing.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.586
I keep the ends on.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.464
They get nice and crispy.
You can cut 'em off when they're cooked.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.967
Perfect. We're gonna add salt.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.178
Look how beautiful!

30:05.261 --> 30:08.014
-How could you not love vegetables?
-It does look good, doesn't it?

30:08.097 --> 30:10.725
The cooking that I wanna be able to do,
there's eye appeal.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.269
-This is, like, sexy-looking, you know?
-Yeah, totally.

30:13.353 --> 30:17.357
Like, even if I don't fully know what's
going on right now, it looks like I do.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.068
Eye appeal to Kayla,
who's, like, looking at you cooking,

30:20.151 --> 30:21.611
or your eye when you're looking?

30:21.694 --> 30:23.530
Well, no, someone looking at me like I'm--

30:23.613 --> 30:25.824
-Oh! So it's all about vanity for you.
-See-- So--

30:25.907 --> 30:28.159
Oh, absolutely,
'cause I look at this, and I'm like,

30:28.243 --> 30:30.370
"Oh, shit, I don't know
what's going on here." You know?

30:30.453 --> 30:32.455
-But you look like a pro! Yeah.
-Exactly!

30:32.539 --> 30:33.790
Put that towel on your shoulder,

30:33.873 --> 30:35.583
all of a sudden it's like,
demands respect,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.377
Right? It's very practical.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.380
So now, we're basically
gonna assemble our glaze.

30:40.463 --> 30:43.049
This is a glaze that
you can use for chicken, for fish.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.552
So here I have some fresh thyme.
Have you ever had thyme?

30:45.635 --> 30:46.636
-No.
-Here.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.596
-They grow upward, right?
-Uh-huh.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.683
[Antoni] And, if you kind of go down
with your finger, gently…

30:51.766 --> 30:53.434
This stem we don't really want.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.520
And those, you can just
kind of throw right in there.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.730
-So we're just interested in the leaves?
-Yeah.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.984
That's where all the flavor is.
We don't need very much. Just a little.

31:01.067 --> 31:03.778
-Then next up, honey.
-Just straight up honey right here.

31:03.862 --> 31:04.904
[Antoni] Straight up honey.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.031
So, the reason
I'm adding it now and not earlier,

31:07.115 --> 31:08.825
honey is very high in sugar,

31:08.908 --> 31:10.827
and this would have,
like, burnt to a crisp

31:10.910 --> 31:12.453
if we added it a little too early on.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.998
-Do you like spice? Chili flakes?
-Yeah, let's do it.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.208
So, we're gonna put a little of that.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.129
And then,
literally we're just coating it around.

31:21.212 --> 31:24.007
It's like a nice little forward-backward.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.009
-You can do it.
-All right.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.177
[Antoni] There you go!

I like that he's feeling empowered,
that he feels like he's a boss doing this.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.869
That's what excites me about it.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.165
I will say, the carrots
I'm most impressed with, though.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.167
Might be the best carrot
I've ever had in my life.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.501
-Really?
-Pretty good, yeah.

32:01.085 --> 32:04.130
'Cause that spice at the end is like…
'Cause you don't taste it right away.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.061
I thought the etiquette class was
the probably most thoughtful thing

35:47.145 --> 35:48.604
anyone's done for me in a long time.

35:48.688 --> 35:49.564
Nice.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.983
I've always set others ahead of me.

35:52.066 --> 35:56.112
Putting yourself second is something that
you've practiced for a very long time.

35:56.195 --> 35:59.782
It's not even second, dude.
It's, like, 300th, you know?

35:59.866 --> 36:02.451
How does it make you feel
that you'd put yourself 300th?

36:02.535 --> 36:04.245
It makes me feel honorable.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.247
It makes me feel, like, admirable.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.999
You're spinning. That's part of the charm.

36:08.082 --> 36:09.959
It's like, "I feel admirable.
I feel honorable."

36:10.042 --> 36:12.420
But I know for a fact,
'cause I've been there before,

36:12.503 --> 36:16.966
as someone who's
put myself not first, I feel shitty as…

36:17.049 --> 36:19.135
None of us can live our lives
putting ourselves second.

36:19.218 --> 36:22.513
Even if you're a parent, you have to be
able to respect and love yourself first.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.724
So that way you can
start taking responsibility

36:24.807 --> 36:26.809
for every one of your relationships.

36:27.768 --> 36:30.938
Do you think you took responsibility
in your relationship with Kayla?

36:31.439 --> 36:33.733
You kidding me?
I was a degenerate, you know?

36:33.816 --> 36:36.402
I looked at other women.
I shouldn't have done that.

36:37.737 --> 36:40.406
Yeah, she was sure always easy.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.617
So, it's like,
"Oh, man, dude, I'm scared."

36:42.700 --> 36:45.411
"Like, I found this girl
that I really like."

36:45.494 --> 36:48.748
"What am I gonna do?
Oh, shit, man. We're getting attached."

36:48.831 --> 36:52.043
Like, we're talking about marriage,
stuff like that. That's scary.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.628
Everyone's scared, though, right?

36:53.711 --> 36:54.587
No.

36:54.670 --> 36:55.504
You're not scared?

36:55.588 --> 36:57.381
No, because I trust and I love myself.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.968
And I know by trusting and loving myself,
I'm gonna make the right decision.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.970
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah, you can.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.389
What was the first thing
you did when you were like,

37:05.473 --> 37:07.600
"Shit, man, I gotta love myself"?

37:07.683 --> 37:10.019
You think about the ways
and things that you do to yourself

37:10.102 --> 37:11.354
that's not loving yourself.

37:12.104 --> 37:13.606
And so for me, I used to drink a lot.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.650
I used to party
every once in a while with drugs.

37:15.733 --> 37:19.695
But I realized all of those actions, none
of those were serving me to love myself.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.406
To the outside world, I was successful.

37:22.490 --> 37:26.452
And I was looking at myself in the mirror,
and I was like, "I don't have it."

37:26.535 --> 37:28.120
I think we have a similar history.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.622
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:29.705 --> 37:33.751
But you know you can get past that,
and you can start to love yourself more.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.504
Because the minute you start
to heal things in yourself,

37:36.587 --> 37:39.173
things'll get better in all
the other relationships in your life.

37:39.882 --> 37:42.718
Knowing that your dream
is to have a family, this life.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.762
That Kayla was a part of that dream.

37:45.638 --> 37:46.514
Yeah.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.600
-Have you ever said "I'm sorry" to her?
-No.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.893
No, never.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.770
I would love for you to call Kayla.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.897
And you don't have to apologize right now,

37:54.981 --> 37:56.649
'cause I think it needs
to be face-to-face.

37:56.732 --> 37:57.566
Yeah.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.818
But I think maybe inviting her

37:58.901 --> 38:01.112
to come over
with the specific reason of saying,

38:01.195 --> 38:02.321
"Hey, I need to talk to you."

38:02.405 --> 38:05.616
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Unfiltered honesty like you just gave me.

38:05.700 --> 38:09.120
Hearing that Kayla never got
an apology breaks my heart.

38:09.203 --> 38:11.831
Because so many people leave relationships
without getting closure.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.751
-[Kayla] <i>Hey.</i>
-[Josh] Hey.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.420
<i>-Hey.</i>
-[Josh] What are you doing?

38:18.587 --> 38:20.965
<i>Just relaxing. What are you doing?</i>

38:21.048 --> 38:22.133
[Josh] Uh, just hanging out.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.970
But that also means that Josh
never closed this relationship properly.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.556
So he never got to own up
to what he's done,

38:28.639 --> 38:31.392
which when you can't own up
and be truthful with yourself,

38:31.475 --> 38:33.644
there's no growth
or healing ever happening.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.188
Would you like to come hang out?

38:37.356 --> 38:39.317
If you want true growth and healing,

38:39.400 --> 38:41.986
you gotta own up
to what you did and confront it.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.323
<i>I mean, definitely. I will be there.</i>

38:45.406 --> 38:47.616
All right, honey. I'm excited about it.

38:48.451 --> 38:52.246
This is the first step
in his actions matching his words.

-All right, bye.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.544
-Ha!
-You're getting emotional here?

38:58.627 --> 39:01.797
No, I'm not getting emotional, man.
I said I wasn't gonna cry.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.507
First time I've seen your eyes gloss up.

40:52.199 --> 40:56.120

are ridiculous, you know?

40:57.455 --> 41:00.666
You know, one of my favorite things
about the space now

41:00.749 --> 41:03.878
is your new family crest. Your legacy.

-Yeah, yeah. I mean…

41:58.974 --> 41:59.850
I could tell.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.811
After six hours in a salon with you,
I felt a little more comfortable.

-Oh.
-Yeah.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.314
And now you're all-the-way comfy.

Yeah! You actually did what you said you
were gonna do. You're not full of shit.

You actually made me note cards.
You actually, like, helped me.

42:46.647 --> 42:49.358
Question is, what do you think
our game plan should be?

42:49.900 --> 42:53.237
Honestly, I think what I need to do is
I think I need to apologize to her.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.196
Perfect.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.322
And actually mean it.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.492
It's real easy to say "I'm sorry."
Been doing that since kindergarten.

42:59.118 --> 43:03.330
Actually look her in the eyes and say,
"I'm sorry I wasn't a good guy to you."

43:03.414 --> 43:07.167
And that apology, for her,
to mean something, you gotta own it.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.087
-You want me to own the actual truth?
-Own the truth.

43:10.170 --> 43:12.256
-The only way this is gonna work.
-I'll own it.

43:12.339 --> 43:13.799
[Karamo] If you're giving an apology,

43:13.882 --> 43:17.261
there can never be
a "but" or a "what" or a "why."

43:17.344 --> 43:20.097
Apologies are just
owning what you have done

43:20.180 --> 43:23.601
and allowing the other person to receive
the fact that you understand what you did.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.061
-Have you ever given an apology like that?
-No.

43:26.145 --> 43:29.189
And I still haven't yet,
so I'm a little bit nervous. Yeah.

43:30.190 --> 43:31.942
-Hey, Tanny.
-Sorry to interrupt, kids.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.027

-[Josh] No.

-But it's not like a work boot.
-Uh-huh.

43:51.086 --> 43:54.256
And so, if you were to go
out on a date or whatever,

43:54.340 --> 43:56.216

to wear this kind of thing.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.677
Tan, your backside's a third look.
It looks so cute in those jeans.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.388
[laughs] Thank you. All right, Josh!

44:42.471 --> 44:45.015
-[Jonathan] Wow!
-Whoo!

44:45.099 --> 44:47.393
-[Antoni] Is that a suede shirt?
-It sure is!

44:47.476 --> 44:51.188
The goal was to not to take Josh
too much out of his comfort zone.

44:51.271 --> 44:52.439
-I like this one.
-Good.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.483
-How's the hair?
-You look gorgeous!

44:54.566 --> 44:57.069
-Thank you.
-It's time for us to leave! Time to go.

44:57.152 --> 44:58.404
Joshy.

44:58.487 --> 45:00.739
You guys came in pretty hard and heavy.

45:00.823 --> 45:03.784
Then, uh,
I learned a lot about my feelings.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.869
So, uh, thank you, guys.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.455
And I mean that sincerely,
from the bottom of my heart.

45:08.539 --> 45:09.873
-I'm already getting sad.
-[laughs]

45:09.957 --> 45:11.667
Thank you all for being my friend.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.627
-We appreciate it.
-[Karamo] Lifelong friends.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.587
[Antoni] Thank you for opening up to us

45:15.671 --> 45:18.424
and asking a million questions
about every single thing.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.301
-[Josh] Ah.
-You got this. Ahh!

45:21.385 --> 45:23.053
-Thank you.
-[Bobby] Bye, Josh.

45:23.137 --> 45:24.638
-[Tan] Bye!
-[Antoni] Have fun tonight.

45:24.722 --> 45:25.639
Have so much fun!

45:25.723 --> 45:27.224
-Bye!
-Bye, honey!

45:27.307 --> 45:30.060
Oh, my God, this is some
of our finest work. Look at you!

45:30.144 --> 45:31.729
[Tan] I know! He looks so good.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.398
-And then put on a crop top. I love you!
-[laughing]

45:42.698 --> 45:44.032
[Karamo] Love some Wagyu.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.868
Here you go.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.203
-[Tan] Looks absolutely lovely.
-You're all very welcome.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.414
-[Bobby] Come this way.
-[Antoni] Come on, Neon.

45:50.497 --> 45:51.957
[Karamo] Bobby. Johnny.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.835
-Tanny. Antoni.
-[Antoni] Come on.

45:54.918 --> 45:57.421
-Come on, kid. Oh, you too?
-[Karamo sighs]

45:57.504 --> 45:59.631
-All right, all right.
-[laughs] Look at the smile.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.675
-[Tan] Should we do it?
-[Karamo] Yeah.

46:02.885 --> 46:04.011
He looks so handsome.

46:04.094 --> 46:07.097
-[Jonathan] His hair looks really good.
-His hair does look really good.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.142
God, Bobby, that space looks so good.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.602
-[Bobby] I wanna move in there.
-Oh!

46:11.685 --> 46:12.770
It does look beautiful.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.607
[Kayla] Oh, my gosh.

46:16.690 --> 46:17.775
Is this real life?

46:18.859 --> 46:20.861
Oh, my goodness.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.988
And "oh, my goodness" to you. Hello!

46:23.071 --> 46:25.949
Hey, honey, how are you?
I've got something to show ya.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.410
And wait, what? Your beard is like…

46:28.494 --> 46:31.622
-Yeah? You like it?
-[laughs] Oh, my God, this is amazing.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.082
I'm gonna cry for you. This is insane.

46:34.166 --> 46:36.251
No, here. Come here.
I'm cooking us dinner.

46:36.335 --> 46:39.379
-Honestly, she's stunning.
-Stunning, she's gorgeous.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.925
This is… I'm speechless.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.137
-Hey, cheers.
-Cheers.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.430
Thanks for coming over.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.724
-They make a cute couple.
-They do.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.559
We got a couch over here.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.853
[Kayla] Have you,
like, ever had an actual couch?

46:54.937 --> 46:56.939
No, it's the first time.
Isn't that exciting?

46:57.022 --> 46:58.273
-Whoa!
-Wow!

46:58.357 --> 47:01.610
I cannot believe he was
having her over at that last trailer.

47:01.693 --> 47:02.945
I know.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.823
-Did you wash your hair? You look--
-I washed it. You like it?

47:05.906 --> 47:08.909
-Yes! I mean, you have beautiful hair.
-Yeah, smell it.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.869
It smells good. It smells, like, manly.

47:10.953 --> 47:14.414
She was scared to death to smell his hair,
and now she seemed really enjoy it.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.958
-Yay!
-Yeah.

47:16.041 --> 47:17.751
Here. Have a seat.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.294
Aw, thank you.

47:19.378 --> 47:21.046
-One time.
-Prince Charming.

47:21.129 --> 47:23.715
-All right.
-The presentation… ten out of ten.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.385
-You look stunning.
-So do you!

47:27.010 --> 47:29.513
You're beautiful.
Or should I say "bootyful"?

47:29.596 --> 47:32.599
Those jeans look really good
on your… you know.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.852
-[laughs]
-[Fab Five] Oh!

47:34.935 --> 47:37.896
He does have a nice,
little muscular butt, you can tell him.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.190
[Josh] It was such an amazing experience,
you know?

47:40.274 --> 47:41.733
I got to thinking about, like…

47:41.817 --> 47:45.404
[exhales] I don't think until now,
I've ever really thought about our--

47:45.487 --> 47:47.072
I've never apologized, right?

47:49.116 --> 47:50.492
I want you to know…

47:52.244 --> 47:54.454
that I'm sorry,
from, like, the bottom of my heart.

47:56.790 --> 47:59.710
I'm sorry for being dishonest to you.

48:02.546 --> 48:04.006
Because the whole time…

48:05.007 --> 48:06.842
you were amazing, right?

48:07.426 --> 48:10.178
Like, you were the girl
that I wanted, and I just…

48:10.262 --> 48:12.723
I wasn't the guy that you wanted.

48:12.806 --> 48:15.434
But I led it on.
Like, I led you on to believe that.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.604
You know, I'm sorry for misleading you.

48:19.479 --> 48:21.273
And I'm sorry I looked at other women.

48:22.608 --> 48:23.609
I'm sorry.

48:24.234 --> 48:26.445
-[sighs]
-I absolutely adore you.

48:27.237 --> 48:29.156
I'm gonna work on being better.

48:29.239 --> 48:32.659
That was the hardest part
about this entire week,

48:32.743 --> 48:34.286
was reflecting on myself.

48:34.870 --> 48:36.496
I think the problem is that I just…

48:36.580 --> 48:38.540
I never loved myself.

48:39.041 --> 48:40.918
I've got to learn to love myself.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.836
-[Jonathan] Aww!
-That was the final piece.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.464
It's like, "What did I do wrong?
Why didn't they love me?"

48:45.547 --> 48:48.675
Exactly, and it was not about you.
It was 'cause he didn't love his own self.

48:50.510 --> 48:51.887
I accept your apology.

48:51.970 --> 48:53.972
I'm so happy to be
part of this next chapter.

48:54.056 --> 48:56.099
Like, I hope I'm part
of this next chapter with you.

48:56.183 --> 48:59.436
And I'm happy
to support you in any way I can.

48:59.519 --> 49:00.479
[Josh] You're an angel.

49:01.063 --> 49:04.191
My hope for Josh is that
he never stops doing the work on himself.

49:04.274 --> 49:08.070
[Bobby] Just saying "I want a wife
and a family" are just empty words.

49:08.153 --> 49:11.114
Actions and preparations
need to be put into that.

49:11.198 --> 49:14.159
And I think we've definitely
started him on the right track

49:14.242 --> 49:16.328
to finally find his way home.

49:21.833 --> 49:23.877
Ever find yourself in the perfect spot,

49:23.961 --> 49:26.880
wearing your favorite suit,
and you don't know what to drink?

49:26.964 --> 49:30.092
Well, how about revisit a classic?
The Old Fashioned.

49:30.175 --> 49:32.219
Start out with an Old Fashioned glass.

49:32.302 --> 49:33.887
One sugar cube.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.722
A couple of drops of bitters.

49:35.806 --> 49:37.891
Three to four splashes of water.

49:39.726 --> 49:41.895
So Old Fashioneds are
typically made with rye or bourbon.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.815
Today, we're going primo
with some whiskey.

49:44.898 --> 49:46.274
A few ice cubes.

49:46.358 --> 49:49.820
Larger ice cubes will prevent
your cocktail from watering down.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.781
And, finally, zest of a fresh orange.

49:53.740 --> 49:56.535
[sniffs] Mmm! And you have yourself
an Old Fashioned.

49:56.618 --> 49:58.370
Cheers, y'all.
