Nestor Crittenden. That磗 with two Ts.

00:26.687 --> 00:30.637
Tell you exactly how l did it.
Straight-edge razor.

00:30.775 --> 00:35.733
When l catch 磂m breaking the Lord磗
commandments, l rip 磂m with the razor.

00:35.863 --> 00:38.319
You gonna stick me in jail?

00:38.449 --> 00:41.533
Not today, Nestor. We磖e full up today.

00:41.661 --> 00:44.448
Come back next week.

00:44.580 --> 00:48.032
Stupid flatfoot.
Never tell you nothing again.

00:48.167 --> 00:51.038
No wonder you never catch nobody.

01:06.102 --> 01:10.182
- Jerry, don磘 do that.
- What磗 new, Leo? You onto something?

01:11.107 --> 01:13.776
The captain issued a statement.
Didn磘 you get it?

01:13.901 --> 01:17.650
l could fart a better statement than that.

01:18.364 --> 01:20.689
Are we friends or not?

01:20.825 --> 01:23.909
- l won磘 quote you directly.
- What?

01:24.537 --> 01:26.862
You won磘 quote me?

01:26.998 --> 01:30.331
You won磘 mention my name on the TV?

01:30.459 --> 01:33.330
And you call yourself my friend.

01:35.631 --> 01:39.711
- lt磗 not nice, Leo.
- Jerry, l磎 not a nice person.

01:39.844 --> 01:42.251
l磎 a mean, selfish son of a bitch.

01:42.388 --> 01:45.971
You want a story, but l want a killer,
and what l want comes first.

03:06.138 --> 03:08.178
Bye now. Don磘 wait up for me.

03:08.307 --> 03:10.514
Have fun.

03:16.482 --> 03:18.973
Hi.

03:35.501 --> 03:38.835
Where are we going?
Back to the lake, l hope.

03:38.963 --> 03:41.419
(soft rock on stereo)

04:33.935 --> 04:36.390
(switches music off)

05:04.340 --> 05:06.546
Hi, Fran. ls it as good as they say?

05:06.676 --> 05:08.715
lf not, ask for your money back.

05:08.844 --> 05:11.929
- Will we get our money back?
- No way.

05:15.476 --> 05:19.011
- Don磘 by any chance know her name?
- Not by any chance, no.

05:19.146 --> 05:22.895
- lt磗 Tina. Why?
- Nothing chanced, nothing gained.

05:23.025 --> 05:26.275
lt磗 my fifth time l磛e seen this movie.

05:26.404 --> 05:29.358
- l haven磘 even seen it yet.
- You磖e gonna die!

05:29.490 --> 05:34.033
- Robert Redford磗 so gorgeous.
- l like Paul Newman.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.890
Tina. Say hi to Warren Stacey.

05:55.182 --> 06:00.639
Hi, Warren. How are you? Fine,
thank you, Tina. Hot buttered popcorn?

06:00.771 --> 06:04.140
Would you mind
sitting somewhere else?

06:04.275 --> 06:07.691
No, indeed. Wouldn磘 mind at all.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.896
l磀 rather sit here.

06:14.785 --> 06:16.612
Popcorn?

06:18.706 --> 06:22.075
Now look what you磛e done.
Shame on you.

06:29.717 --> 06:31.757
Don磘 go away mad.

08:21.829 --> 08:24.285
(woman moaning and sighing)

08:32.381 --> 08:34.707
Honey.

08:40.264 --> 08:41.806
(screams)

08:41.933 --> 08:43.759
What the hell...?

09:24.392 --> 09:26.431
(sobs)

09:36.237 --> 09:38.692
(girl sobs)

09:53.004 --> 09:56.337
Warren, don磘 hurt me.

09:57.091 --> 10:00.127
Why me? Warren, l磍l do anything for you.

11:13.876 --> 11:16.830
lt磗 so sad when they die at the end.

11:17.797 --> 11:18.793
Come on.

11:18.923 --> 11:20.962
- He磗 so cute.
- Don磘 even look at him.

11:21.092 --> 11:25.504
- He磗 cute, though.
- Yeah, that磗 his problem.

11:26.305 --> 11:29.472
- No hard feelings, l hope.
- Wanna bet?

11:29.600 --> 11:33.135
Come on, don磘 be like that.
Let磗 start over.

11:33.271 --> 11:35.809
You don磘 like popcorn.
How about a drink?

11:35.940 --> 11:37.979
Don磘 tell me you磖e not old enough.

11:38.109 --> 11:40.564
We磖e just not that hard up for company.

11:40.695 --> 11:43.696
Wait a minute.
He磗 only trying to be friendly.

11:43.823 --> 11:46.396
- So what d磞ou have in mind?
- Forget it.

11:46.534 --> 11:52.239
l wouldn磘 wanna come between you and
your girlfriend. Good night, sweethearts.

11:52.373 --> 11:55.742
Don磘 do anything l couldn磘 do better.

11:57.003 --> 11:58.876
(siren)

12:03.342 --> 12:06.296
Charlie! Charlie, come over here!

12:11.601 --> 12:13.640
Get the camera!

12:17.899 --> 12:21.350
- Who discovered the body?
- No comment at this time.

12:21.485 --> 12:26.942
- Can you give us their names?
- Not till the families have been notified.

12:27.074 --> 12:29.400
Were they both naked?
How were they killed?

12:29.535 --> 12:34.197
Anything l might say, without further
investigation, would be speculation.

13:05.529 --> 13:07.652
That磗 mine.

13:09.325 --> 13:13.109
- What?
- The chewing gum. l dropped it there.

13:15.081 --> 13:17.619
McAnn. Paul McAnn.

13:17.750 --> 13:21.036
lt磗 not a very propitious way
to meet, is it?

13:21.170 --> 13:22.997
You might say that.

13:23.130 --> 13:26.831
Don磘 throw things around
where we磖e looking for evidence.

13:26.968 --> 13:30.337
l磎 sorry. l wasn磘 thinking.

13:30.471 --> 13:33.044
- l see you磛e already met.
- Yeah.

13:33.182 --> 13:35.471
Let磗 get on with it. Come on.

13:37.895 --> 13:40.102
Come on.

13:40.231 --> 13:42.638
What do you notice about the MO, Leo?

13:42.775 --> 13:46.559
That girl that was killed
last Christmas Eve, Lorraine Partridge.

13:46.696 --> 13:48.605
Right. Same scene.

13:48.739 --> 13:51.610
Captain Malone and l think
the boy was incidental.

13:51.742 --> 13:54.280
lt磗 obviously the girl the killer was after.

13:54.412 --> 13:58.623
The boy just had the misfortune
to be with her.

13:58.749 --> 14:00.327
Misfortune?

14:00.459 --> 14:02.499
ln the case of both victims,

14:02.628 --> 14:06.329
death was caused by the severing
of the intestines and major arteries,

14:06.465 --> 14:08.707
causing massive haemorrhaging.

14:08.843 --> 14:12.627
This is all all right, but can you tell us
something that we can use?

14:12.763 --> 14:19.762
The Johnson girl磗 blood type
is the least common: AB negative.

14:19.896 --> 14:23.763
ln addition, there磗 evidence
of a hepatitis infection, now dormant.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.939
Was this girl raped, doc?

14:26.068 --> 14:28.642
There磗 no evidence of forcible entry.

14:28.779 --> 14:31.780
- l could have told you that.
- On the basis of what?

14:31.908 --> 14:37.613
lf anybody does something like this,
his knife has gotta be his penis.

14:50.635 --> 14:52.674
Karen, where磗 Betty?

14:52.803 --> 14:56.089
l磎 sure she磍l be here soon.
l guess maybe she overslept.

14:56.223 --> 14:58.761
You guess maybe?
Don磘 you live together?

14:58.893 --> 15:02.096
Yes, but sometimes
she spends the night with a friend.

15:02.229 --> 15:05.848
A friend. When she comes in,
l wanna see her.

15:05.983 --> 15:08.818
- What is it, Warren?
- This is Karen磗 typewriter.

15:08.945 --> 15:11.352
Put it down.

15:11.489 --> 15:13.528
Yes, ma碼m.

15:15.409 --> 15:19.110
Works fine now.
Just needed some cleaning.

15:19.956 --> 15:22.411
- Thanks.
- You磖e welcome.

15:23.334 --> 15:25.659
lf l need you, l磍l call you.

15:26.754 --> 15:29.327
l guess she should change
her sleeping habits.

15:29.465 --> 15:33.048
Would you mind
your own damn business?

15:33.177 --> 15:38.053
What do l care? She screws around
and loses her job, what磗 that to me?

15:38.182 --> 15:39.511
Go away, Warren.

15:39.642 --> 15:41.681
Who is this?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.559
What are you saying?

15:45.773 --> 15:47.813
Oh, no!

15:48.859 --> 15:50.899
Oh, my God, no!

16:00.121 --> 16:03.205
- Betty磗 dead.
- What happened?

16:03.332 --> 16:04.827
No! No!

16:04.959 --> 16:07.960
Does anyone know
what happened to her?

16:18.306 --> 16:21.141
l spent five years as a patrol cop.

16:21.267 --> 16:25.015
ln all that time l thought
l磀 learn to adjust to almost anything.

16:25.146 --> 16:28.764
lt磗 funny, this sort of thing,
the personal stuff,

16:28.900 --> 16:32.980
- l suppose in time you become inured.
- Become what?

16:33.112 --> 16:35.781
Able to face the parents
of a butchered girl.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.943
You just don磘 let your feelings
become involved.

16:39.076 --> 16:42.908
- You磖e only there for the information.
- You smoke?

16:43.039 --> 16:45.909
Not any more.
lf you were smart, you磀 quit too.

16:46.042 --> 16:48.081
l know. lt磗 a filthy habit.

16:48.210 --> 16:51.461
Hazardous to your health,
offensive to everyone around you.

16:51.589 --> 16:53.628
Have l left anything out?

16:53.758 --> 16:57.625
Sometimes you talk like
you should have been a school teacher.

16:57.762 --> 17:02.803
That磗 not surprising. My father was
professor of social psychology, Berkeley.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.306
Oh, yeah? And you磖e a cop?

17:06.395 --> 17:09.396
Lieutenant, l don磘 think
you have a low regard for cops.

17:09.522 --> 17:13.189
What l do think is you regard me
as a profound pain in the ass.

17:13.319 --> 17:18.146
- Finally said something l agree with.
- l磍l try and raise my level of performance.

17:18.281 --> 17:20.952
That shouldn磘 be too hard.

17:22.078 --> 17:24.829
l used to live in this neighbourhood.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.114
That building was once a drugstore.

17:27.250 --> 17:30.619
The owner was hooked on morphine.

17:30.753 --> 17:33.754
His wife tried to have him put away,
so he killed her.

17:33.881 --> 17:36.965
The jury found him temporarily insane.

17:37.093 --> 17:41.885
Six months in the nuthouse
and he was pronounced cured.

17:42.014 --> 17:45.383
A week later he shot his parole officer.

17:49.939 --> 17:52.560
You sure this is the right street?

17:53.776 --> 17:58.319
lt磗 the right address.
Mr and Mrs F L Johnson.

17:58.447 --> 18:02.908
- Oh, jeez.
- What磗 the matter? You know them?

18:03.035 --> 18:04.233
God, yes.

18:06.581 --> 18:10.115
Their daughter and my daughter,
they were friends. God.

18:16.507 --> 18:18.998
- You wait here.
- Wouldn磘 it be better...

18:19.135 --> 18:21.174
No, wait here.

18:46.579 --> 18:50.327
l don磘 believe it. Leo.
lt磗 good to see you.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.746
Marge. Come here, Margie.

18:52.877 --> 18:56.293
Excuse my appearance. l work
on the night shift now. l just got up.

18:56.422 --> 18:58.747
Leo Kessler!

18:58.883 --> 19:01.967
Good Lord, look at you.
You haven磘 changed a bit.

19:02.094 --> 19:05.428
- How long has it been?
- What is it, Leo?

19:05.556 --> 19:08.806
- Can we talk inside?
- Come in.

19:08.934 --> 19:11.057
What磗 wrong? What is it?

19:39.048 --> 19:42.464
Don磘 let your feelings become involved.

19:45.513 --> 19:48.467
Jesus, can磘 you drive any faster?

19:53.271 --> 19:59.226
Before... whatever his name is -
Dale Anders. Who else?

19:59.360 --> 20:03.144
She dated a lot of fellas.
Never a night somebody didn磘 call up.

20:03.281 --> 20:06.151
What are the names of the guys
she went to bed with?

20:06.283 --> 20:09.699
l wish we didn磘 have to ask this,
but we磖e looking for a motive.

20:09.829 --> 20:12.450
All the names you can remember.

20:12.582 --> 20:18.003
Before Dale, there was Larry Williams,
Lou Porter, George Latham.

20:18.129 --> 20:21.794
There was a guy she didn磘 go to bed with
but who called up all the time.

20:21.924 --> 20:27.167
Mexican or something. Every once
in a while he磀 say something in Spanish.

20:27.305 --> 20:30.222
- What磗 his name?
- He磀 never say his name.

20:30.349 --> 20:34.098
All he called up for was to,
you know, talk dirty.

20:34.228 --> 20:38.807
- Did he talk dirty to both of you?
- Just to Betty.

20:40.318 --> 20:44.611
Start checking out these names,
find out if any of them spoke Spanish.

20:44.739 --> 20:47.028
All right, Lieutenant. Thank you, Karen.

20:47.158 --> 20:52.235
Karen, l know this is hard on you, but l磀
like you to show me Betty磗 possessions.

20:52.371 --> 20:54.494
Everything.

20:54.623 --> 20:58.917
l hope you won磘 make her look cheap.
She wasn磘, honestly.

20:59.045 --> 21:02.330
- lf only you磀 known her.
- l knew her.

21:03.049 --> 21:07.296
And though this body be destroyed,
yet shall l see God,

21:07.428 --> 21:13.597
whom l shall see for myself and mine
eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.

21:13.726 --> 21:18.721
We brought nothing into this world,
and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

21:18.856 --> 21:22.308
The Lord gave
and the Lord hath taken away.

21:22.443 --> 21:25.314
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

21:26.197 --> 21:30.325
Unto almighty God we commend
the soul of our sister departed,

21:30.451 --> 21:32.609
and we commit her body to the ground,

21:32.745 --> 21:37.656
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

21:37.792 --> 21:41.836
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life

21:41.963 --> 21:44.584
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

21:44.715 --> 21:46.755
Amen.

21:49.303 --> 21:52.672
- Thank you very much.
- l磎 very sorry.

21:52.807 --> 21:55.132
- Thank you.
- God bless.

21:56.811 --> 21:59.681
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Daddy.

22:00.773 --> 22:03.229
- How are you?
- How am l?

22:04.193 --> 22:10.231
l磎 sick because it wasn磘 so long ago
that she was my best friend.

22:10.366 --> 22:15.361
Have you found out anything,
or am l not supposed to ask that?

22:15.496 --> 22:17.821
Me and McAnn here, we磖e working on it.

22:17.957 --> 22:22.168
- This is Paul McAnn. My daughter Laurie.
- Hi, how do you do?

22:22.878 --> 22:25.417
Excuse me. See you in a minute.

22:26.340 --> 22:29.377
- Are you a cop?
- So they tell me.

22:29.510 --> 22:34.137
- You don磘 look like a cop.
- Your father磗 of the same opinion.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.838
You don磘 sound like a cop either.

22:36.976 --> 22:39.134
ls that good or bad?

22:39.270 --> 22:45.142
l didn磘 say if it was good or bad. l just
said you don磘 look or sound like a cop.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.561
Do you live with your father?

22:49.697 --> 22:51.736
No.

22:52.450 --> 22:55.984
When my mother died,
he and l went our separate ways.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.200
- l磎 a student nurse.
- Really? You don磘 look like a nurse.

23:00.333 --> 23:03.499
What磗 a nurse supposed to look like?

23:04.337 --> 23:07.540
You take after your father, don磘 you?

23:07.673 --> 23:10.164
You think so?

23:10.301 --> 23:13.006
l don磘. Excuse me.

23:14.388 --> 23:16.428
Nice talking to you, Miss Kessler.

23:17.391 --> 23:20.558
Thanks for coming.
Anything at all to report?

23:20.686 --> 23:23.059
Nothing. But we磍l get him, l promise you.

23:23.189 --> 23:26.474
l thought of something.
lt could be important.

23:26.609 --> 23:30.060
Betty always kept a diary,
everything she ever did,

23:30.196 --> 23:32.901
everybody she ever went out with.

23:33.032 --> 23:35.321
Too many. Some of them the worst kind.

23:35.451 --> 23:38.322
Excuse me. Don磘 l know you?

23:40.998 --> 23:44.414
- Do you?
- Well...

23:44.543 --> 23:47.663
l磎 Laurie Kessler.
Haven磘 we met before?

23:47.797 --> 23:49.836
Have we?

23:51.217 --> 23:53.256
Maybe not.

24:03.771 --> 24:08.931
(Betty磗 father) l thought of something.
lt could be important.

24:09.068 --> 24:13.944
Betty always kept a diary,
everything she ever did,

24:14.073 --> 24:17.109
everybody she ever went out with.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.506
(front door opens)

27:02.616 --> 27:04.656
(phone rings)

27:15.004 --> 27:17.080
- Hello.
- Hi, Karen.

27:17.215 --> 27:20.215
- Hi, Tim.
- How are you bearing up?

27:20.927 --> 27:25.090
l磎 a wreck.
l can磘 sleep and l can磘 stop crying.

27:25.223 --> 27:28.223
- l磎 coming over to take you out.
- You磖e a darling.

27:28.351 --> 27:30.390
l just don磘 feel like going anywhere.

27:30.519 --> 27:34.387
l think l磍l just get a bite to eat here
and try to get some rest.

27:34.523 --> 27:37.275
Why don磘 you come over
in a couple of hours?

27:37.401 --> 27:40.984
- OK, that磗 great.
- You磖e an angel. Bye.

27:46.535 --> 27:48.575
(soft music on radio)

29:47.615 --> 29:49.442
Mr Stacey.

29:49.575 --> 29:52.066
Lieutenant Kessler, Detective McAnn.

29:52.203 --> 29:54.242
Can we talk to you?

29:55.248 --> 29:57.287
Come in, please.

30:02.713 --> 30:05.631
- Didn磘 l see you at the funeral?
- Yeah, and we saw you.

30:05.758 --> 30:10.171
- Been shopping, have you?
- You磖e very observant.

30:11.764 --> 30:12.760
(police radio)

30:12.890 --> 30:15.097
What磗 that?

30:15.226 --> 30:18.180
Sorry. Miracle of modern science.

30:18.896 --> 30:21.850
Sit down, please.
l磍l just put these things away.

30:21.983 --> 30:25.102
This is a nice place.
How long have you lived here?

30:25.236 --> 30:26.896
About a year.

30:30.116 --> 30:32.654
lt appears you磖e something
of a movie buff.

30:32.785 --> 30:35.193
l try to see everything worthwhile.

30:35.329 --> 30:39.872
- You磖e into karate, are you?
- Helps keep me in shape.

30:40.001 --> 30:43.915
Nothing takes the place
of regular exercise, does it?

30:45.089 --> 30:47.758
l see you keep yourself informed.

30:47.883 --> 30:52.510
lt磗 not often someone
you know personally gets murdered.

30:52.638 --> 30:55.094
How well did you know her?

30:56.767 --> 31:00.765
- Same as the other girls in the office.
- You ever take her out?

31:00.897 --> 31:01.892
Once.

31:02.023 --> 31:05.723
- Why only once?
- She wasn磘 my type.

31:05.860 --> 31:08.433
We talked to everybody
that went out with her.

31:08.571 --> 31:12.699
Maybe you can shed some light
on what we learned.

31:13.743 --> 31:17.527
- What磗 that?
- This is Betty磗 diary.

31:17.663 --> 31:19.988
We got it from her roommate.

31:20.916 --> 31:24.748
She kept what you might call
a graphic record of her experiences.

31:24.879 --> 31:28.627
For instance, 创So conceited that when
he said did l wanna go to bed with him,

31:28.758 --> 31:31.628
it was like he was doing me a favour.创

31:31.761 --> 31:34.596
- That磗 Larry Williams. You know him?
- No.

31:34.722 --> 31:37.723
创Always talking about
his Corvette and cabin cruiser,

31:37.850 --> 31:41.764
but never once bothered
to mention having a wife.创

31:41.896 --> 31:44.351
George Latham. You know him?

31:45.233 --> 31:46.976
No.

31:49.487 --> 31:53.152
创Good-looking but what a creep.
Makes my skin crawl.创

31:53.282 --> 31:55.322
创l told him to get lost.创

31:56.077 --> 31:59.611
创Creep called me up again.
Creep asked me to the office picnic.创

31:59.747 --> 32:02.748
创l said l had a date. He said l was lying.
That made me mad.创

32:02.875 --> 32:07.371
创l said l wouldn磘 go with him
if he was the last man alive.创

32:07.505 --> 32:09.581
You know who that is?

32:09.715 --> 32:12.965
l磍l give you a hint: you.

32:19.308 --> 32:22.226
They say one shouldn磘
speak ill of the dead.

32:22.353 --> 32:25.556
But the truth is,
she was not a nice person.

32:25.690 --> 32:30.067
- No morals at all and terrible manners.
- l know what you mean.

32:30.194 --> 32:33.112
A man can only take so much abuse
before he strikes back.

32:33.239 --> 32:35.278
That磗 not what l mean.

32:35.408 --> 32:40.366
- Where were you on the night of the 6th?
- At the Aero Theatre.

32:40.496 --> 32:45.870
- Betty Johnson was murdered on the 7th.
- l assumed you meant that night.

32:46.002 --> 32:49.038
Anybody see you there?

32:49.171 --> 32:54.248
The cashier. The manager.
A couple of girls l talked to.

32:54.385 --> 32:58.928
- What was the movie?
- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

32:59.056 --> 33:01.678
The one with Newman and McQueen?

33:01.809 --> 33:03.849
Newman and Redford.

33:03.978 --> 33:06.979
Shall l tell you the rest of the cast,
what it磗 about?

33:07.106 --> 33:09.562
That磗 not necessary.

33:09.692 --> 33:14.354
These are games we play with
just about everybody. Nothing personal.

33:14.488 --> 33:16.980
Can l use your bathroom?

33:17.116 --> 33:19.358
Help yourself.

33:19.493 --> 33:21.533
This is first-rate.

33:22.788 --> 33:26.204
lt磗 a beautiful colour.
l磛e never seen a bullfight, have you?

33:26.334 --> 33:28.575
- A couple.
- Where, Mexico?

33:28.711 --> 33:30.086
Tijuana.

33:31.380 --> 33:34.417
They really as gory as people say?

33:34.550 --> 33:37.124
Not if you think of it as a spectacle.

33:37.261 --> 33:40.013
l suppose that磗 a valid point of view.

33:40.139 --> 33:42.381
Shouldn磘 be so quick to judge, right?

33:42.516 --> 33:45.268
After all, football磗 a fairly brutal sport.

33:45.394 --> 33:52.108
Boxing. Nothing very elevating about
two gorillas beating each other to a pulp.

33:53.986 --> 33:56.608
- This corrida de...
- Corrida de toros.

33:56.739 --> 33:59.444
- What does that mean?
- Bullfight.

33:59.575 --> 34:02.695
- You speak Spanish, huh?
- A little.

34:02.828 --> 34:08.368
(police radio) 3l99. 3l99.
Phone the station.

34:11.379 --> 34:14.664
- May l use your telephone?
- Of course.

34:29.856 --> 34:31.895
Detective McAnn.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.940
Lieutenant.

34:37.737 --> 34:40.027
- Kessler.
- Karen Smalley.

34:40.158 --> 34:41.616
Who?

34:41.742 --> 34:44.659
Pretty girl.
The one Betty Johnson lived with.

34:44.786 --> 34:47.621
- Where?
- The apartment.

34:47.748 --> 34:49.788
l磍l meet you there.

34:57.425 --> 34:59.880
Sorry to bother you.
Thanks for your help.

35:00.011 --> 35:03.593
That磗 OK.
lf there磗 anything l can do...

35:18.362 --> 35:23.819
This is Detective McAnn. He磍l take you
downtown and get your statement, Tim.

35:23.951 --> 35:28.079
l didn磘 do it.
Christ almighty, she was my girl!

35:29.957 --> 35:34.702
- l know you didn磘 do it, Tim.
- All right, Tim. Let磗 go.

35:37.548 --> 35:40.668
- This where you found the diary?
- Yeah.

35:40.802 --> 35:43.719
- Figure that磗 what he was looking for?
- Yeah.

35:43.846 --> 35:46.551
And l got a pretty strong hunch
who it was.

35:46.682 --> 35:49.932
After the funeral, you went
from the cemetery to the market.

35:50.061 --> 35:51.056
l did.

35:51.187 --> 35:54.721
But you didn磘 get home
until three hours after the funeral.

35:54.857 --> 35:58.356
That磗 a hell of a long time
to spend in a market.

35:58.486 --> 36:00.313
Are you telling me or asking me?

36:00.446 --> 36:05.025
You were informed of your right to remain
silent. You agreed to answer questions.

36:05.159 --> 36:07.448
He磗 making charges.

36:07.578 --> 36:11.908
Only the DA磗 office can bring charges.
You haven磘 been charged with anything.

36:12.041 --> 36:15.208
l磍l ask the questions simpler.

36:15.336 --> 36:18.669
- Where did you go after the funeral?
- l went for a walk.

36:18.798 --> 36:21.752
You went for a walk. Why?

36:23.177 --> 36:26.344
- l was upset. l felt bad.
- About what?

36:26.472 --> 36:31.217
When someone you know is murdered,
maybe you feel good. l don磘. l feel bad.

36:31.352 --> 36:35.302
Even about a girl
who was such a bad person -

36:35.439 --> 36:37.681
no morals, no manners?

36:43.990 --> 36:46.065
Warren, you ever been arrested?

36:46.200 --> 36:48.489
No.

36:48.619 --> 36:51.905
Were you ever taken to juvenile court?

36:53.332 --> 36:58.208
For breaking your neighbour磗 window
and throwing a dead animal inside. A cat.

36:58.337 --> 37:04.126
l was 1 2 years old. Stupid thing to do,
but l was angry. l磀 been punished.

37:04.260 --> 37:08.304
Sure, for hurting
the neighbour磗 daughter.

37:08.431 --> 37:11.930
- You cut her with a knife.
- lt was an accident.

37:15.855 --> 37:19.687
- You like hurting girls?
- l won磘 answer that.

37:22.904 --> 37:26.948
Look at him.
That磗 the fella you saw and you磖e sure?

37:27.074 --> 37:29.114
- Yes, of course.
- What was he wearing?

37:29.243 --> 37:32.908
- A red jacket and jeans.
- Designer jeans. He looked very neat.

37:33.039 --> 37:35.162
He was repulsive.

37:39.420 --> 37:42.456
- When did you see him?
- Outside, before the movie.

37:42.590 --> 37:44.915
- And then when he sat down by me.
- By us.

37:45.051 --> 37:47.090
And afterward, on the way out.

37:49.764 --> 37:55.434
You saw this guy before, during
and after the movie. You sure about that?

37:55.561 --> 37:57.803
Yes, l磎 positive.

37:58.647 --> 38:00.936
(Kessler) Did you ever
take her out, Warren?

38:01.067 --> 38:03.558
l drove her to work a few times, that磗 all.

38:03.694 --> 38:06.185
Just not your type, huh?

38:06.322 --> 38:09.239
Her boyfriend objected, so l stopped.

38:09.367 --> 38:12.237
The girls in the movie theatre,
were they your type?

38:12.370 --> 38:13.828
No.

38:13.954 --> 38:17.074
Thanks, kids.
You can go home now.

38:21.045 --> 38:24.046
When磗 the last time
you made it with a girl, Warren?

38:24.173 --> 38:27.459
- That磗 none of your...
- Last week, last month, last year?

38:27.593 --> 38:30.428
- l refuse to answer.
- Never.

38:30.554 --> 38:33.639
Never, because girls won磘
have anything to do with you.

38:33.766 --> 38:38.926
But you get back at them. Betty and Karen
and God knows how many more.

38:39.063 --> 38:45.018
- l won磘 listen to your filth!
- Warren, do you recognise this?

38:45.153 --> 38:49.898
- Leo, knock it off.
- Ever seen one of these? What磗 it for?

38:50.032 --> 38:53.900
Cat got your tongue?
lt磗 for jacking off, isn磘 it?

38:54.787 --> 38:58.073
And these pictures,
you recognise the girls, Warren?

38:58.207 --> 39:02.205
Look at them.
Look at them, Warren! Look at 磂m!

39:02.795 --> 39:04.835
- Stop it!
- Hold it!

39:08.009 --> 39:11.377
You can go home, kid.
Get him outta here.

39:14.098 --> 39:18.843
You better quit while you磖e ahead.
Get him outta here.

39:20.104 --> 39:23.390
- Leo, have you lost your mind?
- You can forget about this.

39:23.524 --> 39:28.684
Have l gotta remind you about evidence
obtained under duress? lt磗 inadmissible.

39:28.821 --> 39:32.605
Right. The way the law protects
those maggots out there,

39:32.742 --> 39:35.493
you磀 think they were
an endangered species.

39:35.620 --> 39:38.953
Will you give me a break?
Let磗 not get into that.

39:39.081 --> 39:43.031
The facts are we磛e got no evidence
and we can磘 hold this kid.

39:43.169 --> 39:45.624
He磗 got an ironclad alibi.

39:48.174 --> 39:52.337
- Do you believe it?
- Everything he says checks out.

39:52.470 --> 39:56.764
The theatre and the market. We
questioned him about the Partridge girl...

39:56.891 --> 40:01.138
Yeah, at the time of the murder he was
in a downtown hotel in bed with a whore.

40:01.270 --> 40:04.224
- Do you believe that?
- Every case is a poker hand.

40:04.357 --> 40:07.311
A good hand you stay,
a bad hand you fold.

40:07.443 --> 40:11.144
You磖e telling me you磖e gonna fold.
l磎 gonna stay.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.365
He磗 our man, Captain.
l磎 gonna get him.

40:21.541 --> 40:23.616
Hello.

40:24.919 --> 40:28.963
l磀 like to see Lieutenant Kessler, please.
l磎 his daughter.

40:29.090 --> 40:34.844
- You say he磗 your father?
- Yeah. He磗 my father, l磎 his daughter.

40:34.970 --> 40:39.051
- l磛e got something for him.
- l磛e never heard him mention a daughter.

40:39.183 --> 40:43.311
That磗 because it seldom
crosses his mind that he has one.

40:43.437 --> 40:46.438
l almost had him the other day.

40:46.565 --> 40:48.605
l blew it.

40:49.610 --> 40:53.026
Bring him in.
l磀 like to have another whack at him.

40:53.155 --> 40:55.825
- (phone rings)
- Clem, bring him in.

40:55.950 --> 40:58.488
Bring him in for what?

40:58.619 --> 41:02.664
Any knifing, rape,
any obscene crime at all.

41:03.416 --> 41:05.539
Just haul him in.

41:06.627 --> 41:09.035
- Give me another chance at him.
- Malone.

41:10.923 --> 41:14.838
- Leo, your daughter磗 out here.
- Ask her if she can wait.

41:14.969 --> 41:17.211
Tell her to wait.

41:18.347 --> 41:20.387
What do you say?

41:21.767 --> 41:23.807
l don磘 know.

41:25.938 --> 41:30.351
- McAnn, what do you say?
- l磎 not sure if l磎 qualified, sir.

41:30.484 --> 41:33.651
Then l磎 not sure you belong here.

41:33.779 --> 41:35.571
What do you say?

41:36.824 --> 41:39.861
lt wouldn磘 take long
for Warren Stacey to hire an attorney

41:39.994 --> 41:44.371
to charge us with harassment
and get an injunction.

41:45.166 --> 41:47.787
(phone rings)

41:47.918 --> 41:49.958
Malone.

41:51.589 --> 41:55.254
- She can磘 wait, Leo.
- l磍l go see what she wants.

41:58.137 --> 41:59.762
How about it?

41:59.889 --> 42:05.974
You know that from a legal standpoint,
we can磘 lay a finger on this guy.

42:06.104 --> 42:09.935
l remember when 创legal创 meant 创lawful创.

42:10.065 --> 42:13.481
Now it means some kind of a loophole.

42:15.404 --> 42:19.022
Miss Kessler, your father磗 busy.
ls there something l can do?

42:19.158 --> 42:20.985
Yeah, l guess so.

42:21.118 --> 42:25.661
There was this guy at the funeral.
l couldn磘 remember where l磀 seen him.

42:25.790 --> 42:29.206
Till l found this.
lt磗 from Betty Johnson磗 office picnic.

42:29.335 --> 42:34.958
That磗 me, Karen, Betty. Dale Anders,
her boyfriend, the one that was killed.

42:35.091 --> 42:39.717
And that磗 the guy from the funeral.
Do you know who he is?

42:39.845 --> 42:42.965
- What about him?
- Betty was scared of him.

42:43.099 --> 42:46.799
- Do you know who he is?
- ls this the only time you ever saw him?

42:46.936 --> 42:49.178
Yes. Now quit trying to act like a cop.

42:49.313 --> 42:52.729
l may not look like a cop to you,
but l am a cop, that磗 my job.

42:52.858 --> 42:57.355
Will you please answer the question?
Why was she afraid of him?

42:57.488 --> 43:00.738
He was always talking about
people who put him down

43:00.866 --> 43:03.654
and how he was gonna
get even with them.

43:03.786 --> 43:06.491
- May l keep this?
- Sure.

43:06.622 --> 43:08.911
- ls there anything else?
- Yeah.

43:09.041 --> 43:14.380
Tell my dad if he磗 too busy to see me,
he might try calling me sometime.

43:14.505 --> 43:18.372
Oh, and l don磘 think
he磍l have any trouble getting through.

43:18.509 --> 43:22.008
At the hospital they know l have a father.

43:26.017 --> 43:28.934
Miss Kessler. Thanks for the help.

43:29.061 --> 43:31.101
Sure.

45:21.465 --> 45:22.461
(phone rings)

45:22.592 --> 45:24.880
All right, all right, l磍l get it.

45:25.011 --> 45:29.637
l wanna borrow that sweater of yours.
Was it in here?

45:29.765 --> 45:32.007
Would you shut up, please?

45:32.143 --> 45:34.515
- Who?
- Wanna turn on the TV?

45:34.645 --> 45:36.685
Laurie.

45:37.898 --> 45:40.983
- Make some tea.
- l did it last night. Your turn.

45:41.110 --> 45:43.648
- Hello?
- (Spanish accent) Hi, baby.

45:43.780 --> 45:47.030
How磗 it going? How are you?

45:47.158 --> 45:49.281
l磎 fine. Who磗 this?

45:49.410 --> 45:55.448
You don磘 know me but l know you.
You磖e beautiful. l love you.

45:55.583 --> 45:59.283
What good does it do to love me
if l don磘 know who you are?

45:59.420 --> 46:01.792
Quiero mamarte la panocha.

46:01.922 --> 46:06.501
- What does that mean?
- lt means l wanna eat your pussy.

46:06.636 --> 46:10.929
You give me blow job,
l give it to you in the ass.

46:11.057 --> 46:13.096
l love you, baby.

46:13.226 --> 46:17.555
You have reached a disconnected
number. This is a recording.

46:18.272 --> 46:20.312
Who was that?

46:22.109 --> 46:24.435
Just some creep.

46:33.370 --> 46:36.122
Thanks for bringing in the photograph.

46:36.248 --> 46:38.537
- Did it mean anything?
- Possibly.

46:38.668 --> 46:41.585
(McAnn) We磖e always looking
for new information.

46:41.712 --> 46:44.085
Dad, is there something else
you wanna know?

46:44.215 --> 46:48.082
- Just came to see how you were doing.
- l磎 fine.

46:48.219 --> 46:51.220
- Working you hard, are they?
- Like slaves.

46:51.347 --> 46:54.218
At least you get to wear a nice uniform.

46:54.350 --> 46:56.639
Why else would l wanna be a nurse?

46:56.769 --> 46:59.723
lf you hit a snag or anything, let me know.

46:59.856 --> 47:03.059
l could pull a few strings.
l know the superintendent.

47:03.192 --> 47:09.147
Dad, you didn磘 come all the way here
to tell me that. Now what磗 on your mind?

47:09.282 --> 47:12.532
Can磘 l be interested in how you磖e doing?

47:12.660 --> 47:14.487
Sure.

47:14.620 --> 47:17.621
- Just don磘 pull any strings, OK?
- OK.

47:17.748 --> 47:20.868
- ls that all you磖e gonna eat?
- lt磗 all l have time for.

47:21.002 --> 47:23.374
l only have a few minutes.

47:23.504 --> 47:25.580
l磎 paying for both.

47:26.632 --> 47:29.966
- Paying for three.
- That磗 some lunch, Dad.

47:30.094 --> 47:32.134
Coleslaw and quiche.

47:33.472 --> 47:36.046
- l hate quiche.
- Then why did you take it?

47:36.183 --> 47:38.425
l thought it was pie.

47:38.561 --> 47:40.850
And coleslaw makes me sick.

47:40.980 --> 47:44.514
- Let磗 get organised about the party.
- l can swing some grain alcohol.

47:44.650 --> 47:47.058
You磖e kidding? That磀 be terrific.

47:49.822 --> 47:53.025
Doreen, Bunny, Ola,
this is Detective McAnn.

47:53.159 --> 47:54.950
- Hi.
- How do you do?

47:55.077 --> 47:59.289
- You don磘 look like a detective.
- So l磛e been told.

47:59.415 --> 48:01.040
Excuse me.

48:01.167 --> 48:03.539
Are you and Laurie磗 dad partners?

48:03.669 --> 48:07.334
Actually, right now l磎 trying
to measure up to his standards.

48:07.465 --> 48:10.086
- Nice meeting you.
- See you later, Laurie.

48:10.218 --> 48:11.166
Bye.

48:11.302 --> 48:13.341
His standards of what?

48:14.430 --> 48:16.470
What the hell kind of remark is that?

48:16.599 --> 48:19.719
Your father磗 been out
on the firing line for over 20 years.

48:19.852 --> 48:21.644
Oh, God.

48:21.771 --> 48:25.685
Do you have any idea how many
commendations he磗 received?

48:25.816 --> 48:30.063
He磗 an outstanding public servant.
Nobody says he isn磘.

48:30.196 --> 48:34.359
But when my mom needed him
or l wanted him, where was he?

48:34.492 --> 48:36.983
Out on the firing line
earning commendations.

48:37.119 --> 48:40.323
What is your problem?
Your father磗 a cop.

48:40.456 --> 48:46.494
- You磛e gotta make allowances for that.
- l磛e been doing that for 20 years.

48:48.798 --> 48:51.467
This place is an ulcer factory.

48:53.511 --> 48:55.918
What磗 wrong here?

48:56.055 --> 49:00.847
Detective McAnn was just telling me
how much he admires you.

49:00.977 --> 49:04.476
You might call this a testimonial lunch.

49:05.356 --> 49:07.811
Laurie, wait a minute.

49:07.942 --> 49:10.647
Dad, l磛e gotta go to the lab.

49:10.778 --> 49:14.527
l wanted to tell you
l磎 sorry l missed you yesterday.

49:14.657 --> 49:17.195
l磀 like to do better.

49:18.494 --> 49:21.246
Let磗 have dinner sometime, OK?

49:22.373 --> 49:23.950
Sure.

49:24.750 --> 49:26.624
Why not?

49:27.211 --> 49:29.251
l gotta go.

49:29.380 --> 49:33.923
lt was a pleasure
to see you again, Miss Kessler.

49:34.051 --> 49:36.507
l am good company, aren磘 l?

49:37.388 --> 49:40.093
You wanna go to a party tonight?

49:40.975 --> 49:44.723
- l beg your pardon?
- We磖e having a party. You wanna come?

49:44.854 --> 49:49.314
- And you磖e inviting me?
- Dad, is he always this slow?

49:50.151 --> 49:52.190
Yes or no? l磎 late.

49:52.320 --> 49:56.732
Thank you very much but... l磎 busy.

49:58.409 --> 49:59.737
OK, bye.

50:00.453 --> 50:05.161
- Busy doing what?
- Frankly, l don磘 think we磀 get along.

50:06.542 --> 50:13.126
Dad, l forgot. l got an obscene phone call
last night from some creep.

50:13.257 --> 50:16.009
- What did he say?
- The usual garbage.

50:16.135 --> 50:19.255
This one had a Spanish accent.

50:21.724 --> 50:25.674
- About that party tonight, Miss Kessler...
- Yeah?

50:25.812 --> 50:30.141
l磛e changed my mind.
What time shall l pick you up?

50:34.320 --> 50:39.659
Attach the microphone to the receiver
and to record press these two buttons.

50:39.784 --> 50:42.950
Keep him talking.
Get him to say as much as possible.

50:43.079 --> 50:47.657
- Do you really think it磗 the slasher?
- Better safe than sorry.

50:47.792 --> 50:52.703
This police radio, nobody outside
the department磗 supposed to have this,

50:52.838 --> 50:55.839
so just use it in case of emergencies only.

50:55.967 --> 51:00.842
- You磖e not trying to worry us?
- l磎 trying to scare the pants off you.

51:00.971 --> 51:05.183
That磗 a new approach.
Most fellas do it manually.

51:05.309 --> 51:09.556
Another thing - l don磘 want you
going anywhere alone, especially at night.

51:09.689 --> 51:13.852
- Was all this your idea?
- No, most of it was your father磗.

51:13.985 --> 51:17.400
For reasons l don磘 quite comprehend,
he seems to be fond of you.

51:17.530 --> 51:19.772
No accounting for taste.

51:19.907 --> 51:21.947
(disco music )

51:36.298 --> 51:38.125
- lt磗 hot in here.
- What?

51:38.259 --> 51:41.593
- l said it磗 hot in here!
- Take your jacket off.

51:41.720 --> 51:43.548
- What?
- Take your jacket off.

51:43.681 --> 51:48.010
- l can磘. l have a gun.
- Why do you have a gun?

51:48.144 --> 51:53.055
He磗 an officer of the peace.
lf you disturb the peace, he磍l kill you.

51:53.190 --> 51:56.061
Hide your cocaine
and no shooting up in the toilet!

51:56.193 --> 51:58.352
You磛e just ruined my whole evening.

52:00.156 --> 52:02.825
- Having a good time?
- A wonderful time.

52:02.950 --> 52:05.406
And to think l almost turned you down.

52:05.536 --> 52:08.952
When l was in college
l really used to love this sort of thing.

52:09.081 --> 52:12.415
- l must be getting old.
- You could be.

52:12.543 --> 52:15.627
Do you have any dizziness,
shortness of breath?

52:17.173 --> 52:23.092
- Maybe we should check your prostate.
- You磛e got to stop being so shy.

52:24.054 --> 52:26.972
Are you... married?

52:27.641 --> 52:30.927
You might have asked me that
before you invited me here.

52:31.062 --> 52:37.515
Your moral standards are so high, l磎
sure you would have told me if you were.

52:37.652 --> 52:39.810
Besides, the only reason you came here

52:39.946 --> 52:42.863
was cos you thought
l needed protection from Mr Obscene.

52:42.990 --> 52:46.324
- That is not entirely true.
- (woman yells out)

52:46.452 --> 52:48.491
Don磘 move.

52:51.791 --> 52:54.875
Don磘 shoot. We weren磘 doing anything.

52:55.002 --> 53:00.293
lt磗 all right. Don磘 be alarmed.
Just carry on. As you were.

53:00.424 --> 53:02.464
lt磗 OK.

53:07.556 --> 53:10.392
ls that what you call keeping the peace?

53:10.518 --> 53:14.017
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

53:16.565 --> 53:19.436
(laurie) Thanks for dinner. lt was terrific.

53:19.568 --> 53:22.605
Thanks for inviting me to the party.
l had a nice time.

53:22.738 --> 53:27.199
l had a date with an intern,
but he had to cancel.

53:27.326 --> 53:30.446
lt磗 OK. l thought he was a pain.

53:30.580 --> 53:32.821
l thought you were too.

53:32.957 --> 53:35.874
l thought you were
fairly obnoxious yourself.

53:36.002 --> 53:38.457
- Changed your mind?
- l磎 thinking about it.

53:38.587 --> 53:41.043
Don磘 strain your brain.

53:42.008 --> 53:45.127
The last thing l wanna do
is get involved with a cop.

53:45.261 --> 53:47.300
l don磘 blame you.

53:51.392 --> 53:53.847
Good night, Miss Kessler.

54:07.366 --> 54:11.945
What are you doing Saturday?
Saturday磗 my day off.

54:12.079 --> 54:13.988
(phone rings)

54:14.123 --> 54:16.163
The phone.

54:28.929 --> 54:30.637
- Hello?
- Hi, baby.

54:30.765 --> 54:33.386
What磗 doing? How you been?

54:33.517 --> 54:36.091
Oh, it磗 you again.

54:36.229 --> 54:39.265
How about we get together?
What you say?

54:39.398 --> 54:43.526
l don磘 usually go out with strangers.
What did you say your name was?

54:43.653 --> 54:48.895
Call me Pedro. That means Peter.
l got the biggest one you磛e ever seen.

54:49.033 --> 54:53.280
That磗 nice to know.
What d磞ou have in mind, Pedro?

54:53.412 --> 54:58.039
l take you to a motel.
We do it every way there is.

54:58.167 --> 55:01.785
How you like it - up, down, front, back?

55:03.714 --> 55:07.926
Whatever suits you, amigo.
Where should l meet you?

55:08.052 --> 55:12.429
- What you say?
- Tell me what hotel. l磍l meet you there.

55:12.556 --> 55:15.511
Like hell you will.
Don磘 fool with me, bitch!

55:15.643 --> 55:17.719
But l thought you loved me.

55:17.853 --> 55:22.100
Kiss my ass, cunt!
l love to stick it to you, that磗 what l love.

55:22.233 --> 55:25.768
Your father磗 a pig,
your mother磗 a whore.

55:25.903 --> 55:28.275
Who told you?
That磗 supposed to be a secret.

55:28.406 --> 55:34.242
l wouldn磘 piss on the best part of you
if you was on your knees begging for it.

55:39.959 --> 55:43.826
- Don磘 fool with me, bitch!
- But l thought you loved me.

55:43.963 --> 55:48.127
Kiss my ass, cunt!
l love to stick it to you, that磗 what l love.

55:48.259 --> 55:51.959
Your father磗 a pig,
your mother磗 a whore.

55:53.597 --> 55:57.891
- Laurie must be really scared.
- lt shook her up pretty badly.

55:58.019 --> 56:01.435
l gave her a police radio,
showed her how to use it.

56:01.564 --> 56:04.849
You didn磘 tell her this is the guy
we磖e after, did you?

56:04.984 --> 56:09.978
Why have her thinking 24 hours a day
she磗 in mortal danger?

56:10.114 --> 56:13.364
- She is, you know.
- Yeah, l know.

56:13.492 --> 56:16.066
We gotta do something.
We can磘 just sit around.

56:16.204 --> 56:20.415
l know, l know.
l磎 gonna have to think about this.

56:22.877 --> 56:26.921
ln case no one ever told you,
your daughter磗 something very special.

56:27.048 --> 56:29.289
Yeah, l know.

56:29.425 --> 56:32.592
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.

57:16.222 --> 57:18.261
(loud pop music )

57:40.830 --> 57:42.988
(music stops)

57:44.000 --> 57:47.534
Smells like pretty good stuff.
Confiscated material?

57:47.670 --> 57:50.161
You testing to make sure
it磗 the real thing?

57:50.298 --> 57:55.006
- l didn磘 expect anybody this late.
- l guess not.

57:55.136 --> 58:00.177
Listen, l have a tape here
l want you to give to Milliken.

58:00.307 --> 58:05.135
Have him make a voice print and compare
it with the one we have on Warren Stacey.

58:05.271 --> 58:08.687
- Where do you keep that tape?
- ln the file.

58:08.816 --> 58:10.809
Better make sure it磗 still there.

58:10.943 --> 58:15.107
- l will.
- You will? When?

58:15.239 --> 58:17.777
- You want it now?
- No big rush.

58:17.908 --> 58:22.037
As long as you do it
within the next five minutes.

59:44.412 --> 59:46.618
- Was there anything else?
- No.

59:46.747 --> 59:51.409
- Just see that Milliken gets right on it.
- Yes, sir.

59:51.544 --> 59:54.414
l hope you don磘 feel
you have to say anything about...

59:54.547 --> 59:57.501
lllegal possession of marijuana.

59:58.092 --> 01:00:00.381
Yes.

01:00:00.511 --> 01:00:04.461
l don磘 see any evidence.
l can磘 bring any charges against you.

01:00:04.598 --> 01:00:07.054
- Much obliged, sir.
- Me too.

01:00:49.352 --> 01:00:55.022
(Stacey) l was 1 2 years old. Stupid thing
to do, but l was angry. l磀 been punished.

01:00:55.149 --> 01:00:59.894
(Kessler) For hurting the neighbour磗
daughter, cutting her with a knife.

01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:04.157
- lt was an accident.
- You like hurting girls?

01:01:05.701 --> 01:01:07.741
l won磘 answer that.

01:01:09.288 --> 01:01:15.492
Call me Pedro. That means Peter.
l got the biggest one you磛e ever seen.

01:01:15.628 --> 01:01:19.626
l take you to a motel.
We do it every way there is.

01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:24.959
Same voice print.
lt磗 the same man, no doubt about it.

01:01:25.096 --> 01:01:29.045
You want me to take him to court on this?
lt磗 a lousy misdemeanour.

01:01:29.183 --> 01:01:33.311
You磖e gonna get 30 days at most.
What磗 that gonna accomplish?

01:01:33.438 --> 01:01:37.934
Gives us 30 days to find something
to hold him permanently.

01:01:38.067 --> 01:01:40.984
What do you think, McAnn?

01:01:41.112 --> 01:01:46.616
l think whatever Lieutenant Kessler
asks for is what he should get.

01:01:47.994 --> 01:01:51.078
Then get a warrant and pick him up.

01:01:54.917 --> 01:01:58.251
- What磗 all that?
- You told me take his clothes to the lab.

01:01:58.379 --> 01:02:00.917
Just the clothes
he was wearing on the 7th.

01:02:01.048 --> 01:02:07.003
- Red jacket, striped shirt, blue jeans.
- And the suit he wore to the funeral?

01:02:07.138 --> 01:02:09.177
OK. That too.

01:02:18.357 --> 01:02:22.984
Perfect match. Blood type AB negative.
Also evidence of hepatitis, now dormant.

01:02:23.112 --> 01:02:24.108
Then that磗 it.

01:02:24.238 --> 01:02:28.781
How do you figure a guy like this? Sets up
a perfect alibi and then blows it with that.

01:02:28.909 --> 01:02:31.282
Why didn磘 he have them
cleaned or burn them?

01:02:31.412 --> 01:02:34.199
l think that might look fairly suspicious.

01:02:34.332 --> 01:02:39.290
Suspicion leaves a reasonable doubt.
This makes him look awfully dumb.

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.797
- He doesn磘 strike me as dumb.
- Everybody makes mistakes.

01:02:43.924 --> 01:02:46.594
l made one myself last night.

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:49.755
l forgot to have Kessler sign
for the tape he picked up.

01:02:49.889 --> 01:02:54.800
Last night? l was with Kessler last night
till one in the morning at his house.

01:02:54.936 --> 01:02:59.265
lt was about two.
Anyway, have him come in and sign.

01:03:02.943 --> 01:03:08.151
Sign here. Standard bail bond agreement.
What it磍l cost you.

01:03:08.282 --> 01:03:11.034
- All l want is out.
- That磗 what we磖e here for.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.028
They put you in, l get you out,
Mr Dante keeps you out.

01:03:15.539 --> 01:03:20.497
- What磗 he looking at, Dave?
- Did they read you your rights?

01:03:20.628 --> 01:03:24.210
- Did you?
- Of course.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.463
Good boy.

01:03:26.592 --> 01:03:29.510
We plead not guilty, demand a jury trial.

01:03:29.637 --> 01:03:32.554
With their backlog,
nobody磗 gonna pay any attention.

01:03:32.681 --> 01:03:37.676
Sexy phone call. l can practically
guarantee you a suspended sentence.

01:03:37.812 --> 01:03:40.564
Excuse me.

01:03:41.691 --> 01:03:43.897
l磎 talking to my client. Do you mind?

01:03:44.026 --> 01:03:46.944
l have something more
for you to talk about.

01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:50.025
We found some blood
on your client磗 clothing.

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:52.482
- We磖e gonna rebook him. Murder one.
- What?

01:03:52.618 --> 01:03:55.287
See you at the arraignment.

01:03:55.413 --> 01:04:00.656
You dirty shit! He磗 lying. There was
no blood on my clothes and he knows it.

01:04:01.293 --> 01:04:03.749
You dirty shit!

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.924
He磗 lying! He磗 lying! He磗 lying!

01:04:11.679 --> 01:04:13.718
No!

01:04:15.141 --> 01:04:17.180
No!

01:04:17.977 --> 01:04:20.016
They磖e coming out now!

01:04:24.942 --> 01:04:26.981
Ask the DA.

01:04:34.285 --> 01:04:37.072
Hold it. OK! Hold it!

01:04:37.205 --> 01:04:39.244
Hold it!

01:04:39.373 --> 01:04:43.122
He磗 been charged with first-degree
homicide and held without bail.

01:04:43.252 --> 01:04:48.377
Evidence will be presented at
the pre-trial hearing. No further comment.

01:04:48.507 --> 01:04:52.256
You did it. Now tell me how you did it.

01:04:52.386 --> 01:04:56.929
- Just lucky, l guess.
- Hell, luck? You磖e terrific.

01:04:59.477 --> 01:05:01.304
How does it look to you, Mr Dante?

01:05:01.437 --> 01:05:03.476
l welcome the opportunity to prove

01:05:03.606 --> 01:05:07.734
that all the evidence against my client
is not only flimsy, it磗 fabricated.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.273
- What do you mean?
- You got a dictionary? Look it up.

01:05:15.075 --> 01:05:18.527
- How well did you know her, Warren?
- Did you do it?

01:05:18.663 --> 01:05:21.367
- How well did you know her?
- Did you love her?

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.910
Dante says the evidence against
his client is fabricated. Care to comment?

01:05:29.048 --> 01:05:31.254
- What evidence?
- Ask him.

01:05:31.384 --> 01:05:35.298
- He wouldn磘 say.
- Makes it unanimous.

01:05:35.429 --> 01:05:38.798
- Why would he say fabricated?
- They always say that.

01:05:38.933 --> 01:05:42.468
Daddy, l gotta go.
l磛e already missed two classes.

01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:45.059
l磎 real proud of my old man.

01:05:46.148 --> 01:05:49.731
And you too. First time l saw you
l said 创That磗 a good detective.创

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.194
- l don磘 remember that.
- l said it to myself.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.358
- l think l磍l go down with her.
- You never answered. Why fabricated?

01:05:58.494 --> 01:06:00.819
- What磗 he up to?
- Forget it.

01:06:10.506 --> 01:06:13.423
McAnn. Can l have a minute of your time?

01:06:13.551 --> 01:06:15.460
l磎 in a hurry.

01:06:15.595 --> 01:06:18.132
Tomorrow l磎 gonna
call you as a witness.

01:06:18.264 --> 01:06:21.218
l磎 gonna ask you about
the evidence against Stacey.

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.631
What about it?

01:06:22.768 --> 01:06:26.433
You know there were no blood stains
till someone planted them.

01:06:26.564 --> 01:06:28.722
Who says that? Warren Stacey?

01:06:28.858 --> 01:06:33.401
McAnn, you can deny it now, but if you lie
in the witness stand, that磗 perjury.

01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:35.522
Perjury is a serious offence.

01:06:35.656 --> 01:06:38.990
Threatening a witness
is fairly serious too, Mr Dante.

01:06:39.118 --> 01:06:42.154
Who磗 threatening?
All l磎 asking for is the truth.

01:06:42.288 --> 01:06:45.739
创You will know the truth
and the truth will make you free.创

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:49.789
lf you don磘 know the truth,
you磀 better find out.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.960
See you.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.429
Hello, McAnn. This is Kessler.

01:06:59.764 --> 01:07:03.512
l磎 not interrupting anything?
lf you have a girl there, l磍l hang up.

01:07:03.643 --> 01:07:07.557
- There磗 no girl. Just me.
- l haven磘 seen much of you lately.

01:07:07.688 --> 01:07:10.939
l thought you might have died of old age.

01:07:11.066 --> 01:07:13.736
l磛e been meaning to call you, Laurie.

01:07:13.861 --> 01:07:16.613
lt sounds like a lame excuse,
but l磛e been very busy.

01:07:16.739 --> 01:07:19.823
Got a new partner, a new assignment.

01:07:21.077 --> 01:07:23.746
l磛e got your radio here.

01:07:23.871 --> 01:07:28.200
l was kind of expecting you
to come by and pick it up.

01:07:29.085 --> 01:07:34.210
- Maybe say hello, if you felt like it.
- Sure, l磍l do that.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:40.010
ls this Paul McAnn, the detective?
l feel like l磎 talking to a stranger.

01:07:40.137 --> 01:07:44.265
l磎 sorry. l just had
a lot on my mind lately.

01:07:44.392 --> 01:07:48.639
Look, l磛e got another call.
l really have been thinking about you.

01:07:48.771 --> 01:07:52.899
l would like to see you.
l gotta go. l磍l call you.

01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:55.267
- Yeah, sure.
- (hangs up)

01:08:01.408 --> 01:08:02.404
Hello.

01:08:02.535 --> 01:08:08.408
Wanted to remind you, in case you forgot,
when you testify tomorrow, remember,

01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:11.293
you磖e sworn to tell the truth,
the whole truth

01:08:11.419 --> 01:08:15.001
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God.

01:08:15.965 --> 01:08:18.004
See you in court, McAnn.

01:08:23.846 --> 01:08:26.884
When Kessler came to get
the tape and the voice print,

01:08:27.017 --> 01:08:29.509
did you discuss anything else with him?

01:08:29.645 --> 01:08:33.394
Shit. He told you, huh?

01:08:33.524 --> 01:08:35.066
Let磗 hear it.

01:08:35.193 --> 01:08:40.269
The boys grabbed a load of... stuff.
They burned most of it.

01:08:40.406 --> 01:08:43.609
- But this was such high quality...
- What are you talking about?

01:08:43.742 --> 01:08:47.361
- What are you talking about?
- Were you with Kessler the entire time?

01:08:47.496 --> 01:08:51.411
- Except when l went to get the tape.
- When you came back, he was here?

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:56.037
- Where else?
- No, l mean here, right here in this room.

01:08:56.171 --> 01:08:58.211
No, he was in there.

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:15.188
- What磗 kept in that refrigerator?
- Blood samples.

01:09:20.154 --> 01:09:23.274
Nice, very nice. Just right.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.447
Let磗 hear it again.

01:09:25.576 --> 01:09:28.198
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.

01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:32.243
Good boy. We can always
plead insanity later.

01:09:32.374 --> 01:09:34.283
- l磎 not insane.
- l know that.

01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:39.495
But in case we have to go that route,
l want you to know we磖e in good shape.

01:09:39.631 --> 01:09:42.087
No matter what you磛e done,
the worse it is,

01:09:42.218 --> 01:09:47.295
the more the jury磗 gonna think that
no normal person could have done it.

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:52.555
So we work out a routine, say
you磖e two people - one good, one bad.

01:09:52.685 --> 01:09:56.933
You start hearing voices, the bad boy
telling the good boy what to do.

01:09:57.066 --> 01:10:00.766
He doesn磘 wanna do it
but he can磘 help himself. You see?

01:10:00.903 --> 01:10:04.901
- You磖e saying l磎 a schizo.
- No, Warren.

01:10:05.032 --> 01:10:08.567
l磎 saying that you walk
out of a crazy house alive.

01:10:08.702 --> 01:10:12.996
They磍l carry you
out of a gas chamber dead.

01:10:51.912 --> 01:10:53.193
What?

01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:57.115
Stacey磗 lawyer磗 putting me on the stand.
He says Stacey was framed.

01:10:57.251 --> 01:10:59.872
Dave Dante磗 not a lawyer. He磗 a shyster.

01:11:00.004 --> 01:11:02.162
He says the evidence was planted.

01:11:02.298 --> 01:11:04.623
Do you know that to him
this is one big game?

01:11:04.759 --> 01:11:07.166
lf he gets Stacey off,
he磗 won the Super Bowl

01:11:07.303 --> 01:11:10.838
and to all the scum out there he磗 a hero.

01:11:10.973 --> 01:11:14.307
l went back to the lab
and talked to the technician. l asked...

01:11:14.435 --> 01:11:18.931
What the hell did you do that for?
Why didn磘 you ask me?

01:11:19.065 --> 01:11:23.691
l was afraid you might tell me
you planted those blood stains.

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:26.061
Yeah, well...

01:11:26.197 --> 01:11:28.236
l did.

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:32.358
Jesus, Leo.

01:11:32.494 --> 01:11:36.196
- Why?
- What kind of a question is that?

01:11:36.332 --> 01:11:39.701
- We磀 have nailed him soon.
- After counting how many more dead?

01:11:39.835 --> 01:11:43.584
He had to be stopped. The only way
to do that is to put him away.

01:11:43.715 --> 01:11:48.127
- You understand what l磎 saying?
- Yes, l understand what you磖e saying.

01:11:48.261 --> 01:11:50.502
You want me to commit perjury.

01:11:50.637 --> 01:11:54.054
What do you think he磗 gonna do?
He磍l lie about everything.

01:11:54.183 --> 01:11:56.259
Stacey磗 not a cop.
He didn磘 take an oath.

01:11:56.393 --> 01:11:58.849
An oath? Jesus Christ!

01:11:59.605 --> 01:12:01.894
Would you take an oath
that he磗 not guilty?

01:12:02.024 --> 01:12:07.897
You go in that courtroom and forget
what磗 legal and do what磗 right.

01:12:09.365 --> 01:12:14.703
lf l thought it was right,
l磀 swear to anything you say.

01:12:18.332 --> 01:12:23.160
We will then present evidence
that the crime was premeditated

01:12:23.296 --> 01:12:26.795
and then we will call witnesses
to testify that the defendant

01:12:26.924 --> 01:12:29.594
harboured malice towards the victim...

01:12:31.387 --> 01:12:34.803
testimony confirmed
by the victim磗 own diary.

01:12:34.932 --> 01:12:40.721
We will produce evidence that there were
blood stains on the defendant磗 clothing...

01:12:40.855 --> 01:12:45.896
that he acknowledges wearing
on the night of the murder,

01:12:46.027 --> 01:12:49.312
expert witnesses from
the police forensic laboratory

01:12:49.447 --> 01:12:52.068
testifying that the blood type...

01:12:54.618 --> 01:12:56.658
Excuse me, Your Honour.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.389
Your Honour,
may we approach the bench?

01:13:20.519 --> 01:13:22.761
You may.

01:13:33.116 --> 01:13:40.162
Your Honour, l must ask for a dismissal of
charges against the defendant, based on...

01:13:49.924 --> 01:13:54.004
ls that true, Lieutenant?
You planted the evidence?

01:13:54.137 --> 01:13:56.592
Yes, sir.

01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:07.937
- What have you got to say, Warren?
- How does it feel to be a free man?

01:14:08.067 --> 01:14:10.143
How do you feel about what Kessler did?

01:14:10.278 --> 01:14:14.110
- He磗 the one that belongs in jail.
- He violated due process.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.447
He thumbed his nose at the Bill of Rights.

01:14:16.575 --> 01:14:20.787
He磗 a disgrace to our system
of law enforcement.

01:14:22.164 --> 01:14:26.493
- Stacey says you should be in jail.
- Why don磘 you go (BlEEP) yourself?.

01:14:26.627 --> 01:14:29.083
Turn that damn thing off.

01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:33.085
What we need is another drink.

01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:36.752
Come on, Laurie. l think
you磛e had too many drinks already.

01:14:36.887 --> 01:14:38.346
No.

01:14:38.472 --> 01:14:40.798
We磖e celebrating.

01:14:40.933 --> 01:14:44.183
First time l ever got drunk with my father.

01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:46.138
Here.

01:14:46.939 --> 01:14:48.979
You know, Dad...

01:14:50.401 --> 01:14:52.857
You oughta fire your housekeeper.

01:14:55.448 --> 01:15:00.157
l磛e been fired once today already.
That磗 enough.

01:15:02.955 --> 01:15:05.078
Son of a bitch.

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:10.502
- l hope he gets what磗 coming to him.
- l hope it磗 sooner than later.

01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:14.627
You know, they磍l probably
give him a medal.

01:15:17.053 --> 01:15:19.923
l磎 talking about Stacey.

01:15:20.056 --> 01:15:23.840
- l磎 talking about McAnn.
- Ah, well...

01:15:23.976 --> 01:15:26.846
l broke the law.
He wouldn磘 buy it.

01:15:26.979 --> 01:15:29.351
20 years ago
l would have felt the same way.

01:15:29.482 --> 01:15:31.937
l don磘 care.

01:15:32.068 --> 01:15:35.234
- l still hate him.
- Laurie, you磛e had enough.

01:15:35.363 --> 01:15:38.566
- That磗 enough.
- Dad, you don磘 understand.

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:41.736
Alcohol is the most effective
tranquilliser l know.

01:15:41.869 --> 01:15:46.366
- You磛e still had enough.
- When you get up in the morning...

01:15:46.499 --> 01:15:50.164
Oh, my God, the morning.
l磛e got a test. l磍l call a cab.

01:15:50.294 --> 01:15:52.583
- l磍l take you home.
- l磍l call a cab.

01:15:52.713 --> 01:15:55.964

You don磘 argue with your father.

l磎 not arguing, Dad.

01:15:58.469 --> 01:16:01.174
You wanna take me home, OK.

01:16:04.392 --> 01:16:09.184
Listen, Laurie,
if Stacey calls again, you call me.

01:16:09.313 --> 01:16:12.682
And if you can磘 reach me by the phone,
use the police radio.

01:16:12.817 --> 01:16:14.441
OK.

01:16:14.568 --> 01:16:17.688
And tell your friends up there
to keep the doors locked.

01:16:17.822 --> 01:16:22.400
They shouldn磘 open up
to anybody that they don磘 know.

01:16:22.535 --> 01:16:25.785
You know, Dad,
l bet when you had your daughter,

01:16:25.913 --> 01:16:29.283
you didn磘 expect
she磀 be so much trouble.

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:31.789
l don磘 mind if you don磘.

01:16:31.919 --> 01:16:33.959
You stay in touch, OK?

01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:23.967
(phone rings)

01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:29.890
Yeah, hello.

01:17:30.686 --> 01:17:33.806

Now the whole world knows, right?

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:45.819
What磗 the matter, cat got your tongue?

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:49.994
To forgive is divine, they say.

01:17:50.122 --> 01:17:53.538
But l don磘 aspire to being an angel.
Know what l mean?

01:17:54.168 --> 01:17:59.245
You tried to kill me. l owe you for that.
And l always try and pay what l owe.

01:18:00.424 --> 01:18:03.295
Be seeing you, Mr Kessler.

01:18:07.848 --> 01:18:09.888
Likewise, Mr Stacey.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.851
l used to like this job.
Now l hate coming to work.

01:19:03.988 --> 01:19:07.439
l磎 gonna put in for a transfer.
Why can磘 they get rid of him?

01:19:07.575 --> 01:19:10.659
- l can磘 sleep nights.
- Me neither.

01:19:37.188 --> 01:19:39.227
What磗 wrong, Mrs Byrd?

01:19:39.857 --> 01:19:43.060
What are these doing here? Answer me.

01:19:43.194 --> 01:19:44.902
- l didn磘 put 磂m there.
- No?

01:19:45.029 --> 01:19:47.816
- Who did?
- Not me. Why would l?

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:50.404
Take them down.
Get rid of them this minute.

01:19:50.534 --> 01:19:54.235
- Will you listen to me?
- l磎 going straight to personnel.

01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:57.041

01:20:58.894 --> 01:21:00.472

- You trying to commit suicide?
- l was gonna ask you the same thing.

01:21:05.943 --> 01:21:09.063
You磖e making life very unpleasant

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:13.823
- Who told you that?
- We in the police have our sources.

01:21:14.994 --> 01:21:17.366
You keep it up,
he磗 gonna come after you.

01:21:17.496 --> 01:21:19.536
You think so?

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.788
lf you wake up one day
with your throat cut...

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.671
l磍l thank you for warning me.

01:21:29.383 --> 01:21:31.043
(car starts)

01:21:31.177 --> 01:21:33.798

01:21:35.973 --> 01:21:39.093

01:22:42.998 --> 01:22:45.038
(phone rings)

01:22:46.419 --> 01:22:50.630
(Kessler) Are you enjoying yourself,
Mr Stacey?

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:15.792

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.830
- What can l do for you?
- The girl that was standing with you here.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:04.128
- Where does she usually take her tricks?
- Who wants to know?

01:25:05.432 --> 01:25:08.848
Usually the Regis. Sometimes

01:25:14.859 --> 01:25:17.231

You got your work cut out for you.

01:25:34.587 --> 01:25:38.584

01:25:38.716 --> 01:25:41.966
- lt磍l loosen you up.
- l磎 already a loose woman.

01:25:46.015 --> 01:25:48.054
Bottoms up.

01:25:49.602 --> 01:25:52.057

01:25:56.901 --> 01:25:58.940

She磗 working.

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:29.085

01:31:18.097 --> 01:31:23.554
Why didn磘 you tell me? Why did you

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:56.106
(police radio)

01:34:33.417 --> 01:34:37.035
- My father磗 gonna kill you.

That was him on the phone.
He磍l be here any second.

Oh, yeah?
Then l guess l磀 better hurry up.

01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:05.654

That磗 him. He磗 here!

01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:25.423
(car starts and drives off)

01:36:58.271 --> 01:36:59.469

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:30.397

Don磘 shoot. Get back! Get away!

01:38:38.371 --> 01:38:42.831
l tried to keep you from running loose.
Now there are three more dead girls.

01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:46.541
You drove me to it.
That blood on my clothes.

01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:48.829
Those pictures on the wall.

01:38:48.964 --> 01:38:54.303
Digging into my personal life. lt磗 my life!
Those phone calls. On me every minute!

01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:57.345
All those girls.

01:38:57.473 --> 01:38:59.549
You sick son of a bitch.

01:39:00.226 --> 01:39:03.725

01:39:08.317 --> 01:39:11.271
lt磗 like l couldn磘 control myself.

01:39:11.404 --> 01:39:14.274
Why else would l kill girls
l don磘 even know?

01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:18.736
lt磗 like l磎 two different people.
l hear voices telling me what to do.

01:39:18.869 --> 01:39:21.028
Once it begins, l can磘 stop!

01:39:22.873 --> 01:39:28.081
So go ahead, arrest me.
Take me in.

01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:31.296
You can磘 punish me.

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:34.128
They can磘 punish me for being sick.

01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:39.086
All you can do is lock me up.
But not forever.

01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:42.390
One day l磍l get out.
One day l磍l get out.

01:39:42.518 --> 01:39:46.432
That磗 the law. That磗 the law.

And l磍l be back. l磍l be back.
You磍l hear from me.

You and the whole fucking world!

01:39:53.612 --> 01:39:55.521
No, we won磘.
