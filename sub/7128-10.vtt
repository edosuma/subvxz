WEBVTT

00:06.300 --> 00:07.000
How's it going?

00:07.201 --> 00:08.701
I've got a little bit of a headache actually

00:08.702 --> 00:12.202
Well shouldn't guys with aneurisms generally try to avoid headaches?

00:12.403 --> 00:14.003
Only guys with brain aneurisms

00:14.104 --> 00:15.704
Yeah, you have a brain aneurism

00:15.805 --> 00:16.705
That's a good point

00:19.106 --> 00:20.306
Good morning, good morning

00:28.007 --> 00:29.907
I knew I should have taken the stairs

00:49.808 --> 00:51.008
Eli

00:53.409 --> 00:54.509
Eli

00:55.210 --> 00:57.710
Oh thank God, I was having a vision

00:57.911 --> 01:02.611
So, thank God you're only lying in the hospital
recovering from uncontrollable bleeding

01:02.812 --> 01:04.412
Deep in seventies music

01:04.413 --> 01:08.013
The last thing I remember
I was begging you not to hate me

01:08.014 --> 01:10.314
But bleeding from your nose
it's a nice trump card

01:10.315 --> 01:11.815
You're that important to me

01:12.016 --> 01:13.016
You both are

01:13.717 --> 01:14.617
I've been a jerk

01:15.918 --> 01:17.918
And it's had some consecuences

01:19.019 --> 01:22.519
Your MRI revealed another aneurism, Eli

01:23.120 --> 01:25.120
A second aneurism

01:25.121 --> 01:27.121
Right in the base of your brain

01:27.522 --> 01:30.322
So how... did this happen?

01:30.323 --> 01:32.423
It's... it's somewhat common actually

01:32.424 --> 01:35.224
And people with aneurisms have a twenty percent chance

01:35.225 --> 01:36.625
No I... I was asking Frank

01:36.926 --> 01:41.826
All that Nurhachi and all those visits to Dr. Lee
may have caused this

01:41.827 --> 01:44.927
Nurhachi?  Wait, who, who, who is Dr. Lee?

01:44.928 --> 01:46.528
She's an acupuncturist

01:46.529 --> 01:48.429
What she does is not acupuncture

01:48.430 --> 01:51.130
But we're done with all that, right Eli?

01:55.531 --> 01:57.631
Ok, alright, listen to this one

01:57.632 --> 02:00.732
Spoil yourself at our oasis in the desert
because you deserve it

02:00.733 --> 02:01.933
I do deserve it

02:01.934 --> 02:07.734
Two nights stay includes a mud bath, a wormwill watsu
massage and a craneal sacral spa treatment

02:07.735 --> 02:09.335
Ufff, sounds invasive!

02:09.336 --> 02:12.036
Ugh, they're trained in Switzerland Matt!

02:12.037 --> 02:12.737
How much?

02:16.138 --> 02:18.338
For the last six weeks it's been all baby all the time

02:19.039 --> 02:20.739
Unless it's been all work all the time

02:22.140 --> 02:22.940
You know what?

02:22.941 --> 02:25.041
So what if the little guy can't afford college?

02:25.042 --> 02:27.242
We'll homeschool, do it!

02:28.443 --> 02:30.143
I feel more relaxed already

02:33.444 --> 02:37.944
Huh! The Russell vs. Baywest Media
settlement just fell apart.  This is huge

02:37.945 --> 02:39.345
I should get to the office

02:39.346 --> 02:42.646
Yeah, whatever Russell vs. Baywest Media is,
it better not interfere with our vacation

02:43.547 --> 02:45.947
Swiss massages, Matt!

02:46.748 --> 02:50.648
Russell vs. Baywest Media are delaying the settlement meeting.

02:50.649 --> 02:52.249
Eli, thank you for joining us!

02:53.150 --> 02:55.250
Feeling a little under the weather

02:56.051 --> 02:57.951
Nothing life threatening brain surgery won't cure

02:59.052 --> 02:59.952
I'm kidding

03:00.053 --> 03:01.753
Why are we stalling on the settlement?

03:01.754 --> 03:03.354
I mean I just spent a month convincing Sam

03:03.355 --> 03:06.755
that he wasn't gonna prove wrongful
termination without a whistle blower

03:06.756 --> 03:07.856
We may have found that whistle blower

03:07.857 --> 03:09.857
Sorry I'm late.  What I missed?

03:09.858 --> 03:14.158
What's the point of calling an emergency staff
meeting if the staff doesn't treat it like an emergency?

03:14.159 --> 03:15.059
I said I was sorry

03:15.160 --> 03:17.460
We may have gotten a break on the Sam Russell case

03:17.661 --> 03:21.061
Sam Russell as in Russell vs. Baywest Media?

03:21.062 --> 03:23.762
You may have noticed that Russell 
lost his gig-anchoring evening news

03:23.763 --> 03:25.663
Well, that's kind of what the suit is about

03:25.664 --> 03:27.664
And this is going to trial this week

03:27.665 --> 03:29.765
That'll depend on what this witness has to say

03:29.766 --> 03:33.466
Her name is Jesse Bates, Russell's former news producer

03:33.467 --> 03:34.667
She's been MIA for months

03:34.668 --> 03:37.368
They've been banking on the idea that Russell wouldn't go to trial

03:37.369 --> 03:38.369
without a testimony

03:38.370 --> 03:41.170
And now that she's resurfaced so 
have Russell's courtroom ambitions

03:41.171 --> 03:43.971
Baywest wants you two to talk to her and
find out if what anything she knows

03:43.972 --> 03:45.872
We'll set it on this afternoon, not a problem

03:45.873 --> 03:46.873
Little problem

03:46.874 --> 03:49.974
She resurfaced when her name 
popped up in a public record search

03:49.975 --> 03:52.375
She's, uh, warming the inside of a jail so as we speak

03:52.376 --> 03:53.176
What she do?

03:53.177 --> 03:54.777
Ask her yourself when you see her tomorrow

03:54.778 --> 03:56.878
The two of you leave for Sonoma in the morning

03:56.879 --> 03:58.079
Uh... Sonoma?

03:58.080 --> 04:03.080
Uh... sorry, no. I've got getaway plans
starting tomorrow

04:03.081 --> 04:03.381
Cancel it

04:03.382 --> 04:04.682
And even if I didn't not a big fan of Sonoma

04:04.683 --> 04:07.283
You don't want to go to Sonoma Matt? That's fine.

04:07.284 --> 04:10.484
I'll tell you what, we'll just wait for Russell's
attorneys to go up there, speak with her

04:10.485 --> 04:12.285
And we'll find out from them

04:17.185 --> 04:18.286
It's a race to Sonoma

04:18.286 --> 04:20.487
Worst triada show ever

04:24.388 --> 04:27.388
I was uh... wondering if you got my messages

04:27.389 --> 04:28.289
And your emails

04:28.290 --> 04:31.790
I'm not going to the zoo benefit with you
I mean, you didn't really think I would did you?

04:31.791 --> 04:32.591
We're a new firm Taylor

04:32.592 --> 04:35.792
It's important that we establish a presence
in events like this one

04:36.293 --> 04:38.693
And since Ellen and I

04:38.694 --> 04:43.094
I need a date and I thought we could talk

04:43.095 --> 04:45.595
Dad, I'm not ready to talk, I told you I need time

04:47.396 --> 04:50.696
Um, I was just sending you an email,
but since you're here

04:50.997 --> 04:52.397
I want in on the Russell case

04:52.898 --> 04:55.198
A newfound appreciation for employment law?

04:55.199 --> 04:57.499
A newfound appreciation for Sonoma Valley

04:57.500 --> 04:59.900
Matt and I were planning a getaway and

05:00.401 --> 05:01.401
I'm getting away

05:02.602 --> 05:04.402
Uh, I'm sure Eli could use the help

05:06.603 --> 05:07.703
What help could Eli use?

05:07.904 --> 05:09.304
I'm going to Sonoma with you

05:09.305 --> 05:09.905
Great!

05:10.006 --> 05:12.406
I'll pick you up at your place 7.30 am, sharp

05:13.107 --> 05:15.707
And sharp means sharp Eli
If you're not standing out front

05:15.708 --> 05:17.108
I will leave without you

05:23.809 --> 05:26.809
Road trip!  We're all going together, yeah!

05:26.810 --> 05:28.010
You don't get car-sick, do you?

05:28.811 --> 05:29.211
Taylor!

05:29.212 --> 05:31.712
We're going to the same place
looking for the same person

05:31.713 --> 05:33.713
We're going together, It makes sense

05:33.714 --> 05:35.514
Only if you ignore the fact that
we are trying to beat them

05:35.515 --> 05:37.615
Come on, we're saving gas
Think about the world for a change

05:37.616 --> 05:39.116
You're oposing counsel!

05:39.117 --> 05:42.217
Taylor tell me you understand that there is an
advantage in getting to the witness first

05:42.218 --> 05:44.118
If this witness has anything important to say

05:44.119 --> 05:45.519
You're gonna have to disclose it anyway

05:45.520 --> 05:48.120
In other words, if you don't get in this car
the next thirty seconds

05:48.121 --> 05:49.521
I will leave you in the dust

05:49.522 --> 05:50.122
She means it dude.

05:50.123 --> 05:53.623
Do not understimate the fury of a woman
denied a romantic getaway with me

05:53.624 --> 05:55.424
Hey! Sorry I'm late!

05:55.425 --> 05:56.825
And the band's back together

05:56.826 --> 05:57.426
Shotguns!

05:57.427 --> 05:58.227
Wish I had one

05:58.228 --> 05:59.128
Shotgun, Eli, you're in the back, let's start!

05:59.129 --> 06:00.729
Wh... I brought gorp!

06:00.730 --> 06:01.330
In the back!

06:01.331 --> 06:01.931
This is crazy!

06:01.932 --> 06:03.432
That's what I said but I was overruled

06:03.433 --> 06:04.733
Clock's ticking Eli!

06:04.734 --> 06:05.834
You coming or not?

06:18.735 --> 06:22.135
I hope that we could find a very romantic
B and B outside of Sonoma

06:22.136 --> 06:24.336
Like Napa, Santa Rosa

06:25.037 --> 06:25.837
Mexico

06:26.938 --> 06:29.438
Alright.  What is the deal with you and Sonoma?

06:29.439 --> 06:31.639
Nothing!  Nothing!  It's gonna be great

06:31.640 --> 06:32.840
Very relaxing

06:32.841 --> 06:34.441
OK, we're gonna need some ground rules here

06:34.442 --> 06:36.342
Travelling together is one thing

06:36.343 --> 06:38.243
But once we hit Sonoma each team is on their own

06:38.244 --> 06:39.244
No collaborating with the enemy

06:39.245 --> 06:42.345
Fine, as long as a couple's massage
doesn't count as collaboration

06:43.546 --> 06:45.946
You know I never thought I'd say this
but would you pass the gorp

06:46.747 --> 06:47.947
Not until you apologize

06:48.748 --> 06:49.148
Excuse me?

06:49.149 --> 06:52.249
You accused me of sabotaging your
relationship with other women

06:52.250 --> 06:54.050
OK, first of all it was just one woman

06:54.051 --> 06:57.351
In my defense I didn't realize that doing
so would deprive me of gorp

07:01.452 --> 07:03.652
You're right.  I apologize.

07:04.853 --> 07:07.153
It turns out I was able to sabotage everything else by myself

07:08.154 --> 07:08.754
Eat your gorp

07:15.955 --> 07:17.455
So how's life, brother?

07:17.456 --> 07:19.956
Boy have never make appoinment Jin

07:20.457 --> 07:21.957
See you next Tuesday

07:26.058 --> 07:27.658
What was that going on with Eli yesterday?

07:27.659 --> 07:29.759
You're the one with the real medical degree, dude

07:30.160 --> 07:31.260
If you don't know then we're in real trouble

07:31.261 --> 07:32.761
Na, na, na... you know what I'm talking about

07:32.762 --> 07:34.762
What did Eli mean whe he said
that you saw this coming?

07:34.763 --> 07:35.763
It's not important Nate

07:35.764 --> 07:37.164
Well it seemed pretty important to Eli

07:37.165 --> 07:41.365
And even if it wasn't you can bet that my brother
seeing another doctor is gonna get my attention

07:41.366 --> 07:42.166
Dr. Lee?

07:42.167 --> 07:44.867
Dr. Lee used to be a decent acupuncturist

07:44.868 --> 07:48.068
It's been a bone of contemption between us
But it's between us

07:48.069 --> 07:50.269
Alright, alright, I can respect that

07:50.370 --> 07:51.170
Thank you

07:51.171 --> 07:55.771
If I just... I wonder how Eli is gonna react
when he finds out that you kept a copy of my dad's journal

07:55.772 --> 07:57.772
And you didn't tell him

08:03.573 --> 08:05.273
If you tell Eli about the book

08:06.274 --> 08:07.674
You'd be hurting him more than me

08:08.275 --> 08:10.075
And I don't think you'd do that Nate

08:15.276 --> 08:17.276
You know you're not fooling anybody with that phony accent!

08:19.277 --> 08:20.977
And you are staying in our Merlot Suite

08:21.978 --> 08:23.278
All the rooms are named after wines

08:23.279 --> 08:25.579
I just need a deposit from you and Mr. Dunlevy

08:25.679 --> 08:26.879
Dunlevy?

08:26.880 --> 08:28.380
Stanislas Dunlevy?

08:28.381 --> 08:29.081
That's my travel name

08:29.382 --> 08:30.982
Bono does the same thing

08:32.383 --> 08:33.283
Thanks

08:34.784 --> 08:36.284
Why are you holding the car keys?

08:37.085 --> 08:38.184
Taylor asked me to

08:38.186 --> 08:39.785
No she didn't, you just took them

08:40.486 --> 08:41.187
You're gonna ditch us, aren't you?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.788
Someone's a little paranoid

08:43.089 --> 08:44.589
Would you tell me the way to the Sheriff's station, please?

08:44.590 --> 08:46.690
Oh, yes sir.  The Sheriff's station's in the town plaza

08:46.691 --> 08:47.891
Right down first street. You can't miss it

08:47.892 --> 08:48.592
Thank you

08:50.793 --> 08:51.593
Where are you going?

08:51.594 --> 08:52.494
Sheriff's station

08:52.495 --> 08:54.095
While our eyewitness is being held with you

08:54.096 --> 08:57.596
I'm sorry, the violation of professional ethics
forbid to drive opposing counsel in my car

08:57.597 --> 08:58.697
It's not your car

08:58.698 --> 09:00.498
Well, for the time being, they're my keys

09:00.799 --> 09:01.099
So...

09:01.900 --> 09:03.700
She's gonna need the number of a taxi service

09:05.601 --> 09:08.201
Guess I wasn't so paranoid after all

09:09.302 --> 09:13.002
You know you seem tense lately, maybe
water yoga is exactly what you need

09:13.003 --> 09:15.603
I should go talk to this witness and get the hell out of...

09:16.504 --> 09:18.804
Hey look antiques, you see this?

09:21.505 --> 09:22.205
Matt?

09:23.406 --> 09:24.606
Matt Doud?

09:25.907 --> 09:26.907
It is you!

09:28.208 --> 09:30.108
What's it been?  Ten years?

09:31.409 --> 09:32.809
Uh, Lee Rappaport, Taylor Wethersby

09:32.810 --> 09:33.810
Hi, nice to meet you

09:33.811 --> 09:36.511
Uh, Lee and I went to law school together

09:36.512 --> 09:39.512
Oh, went to law school together?

09:39.513 --> 09:41.113
Is that how we're framing it?

09:41.114 --> 09:41.414
Oh, we did!

09:41.415 --> 09:43.315
Oh, we did it

09:44.916 --> 09:45.916
What are you doing in Sonoma?

09:45.917 --> 09:47.817
Awkward business trip, you know, in and out

09:48.818 --> 09:52.718
Um, listen I have to get back to work but
it's been nice seeing you again

09:55.119 --> 09:55.619
Alright Lee

09:57.020 --> 10:00.720
So she's the reason you've been so
afraid to step foot in Sonoma

10:00.721 --> 10:01.921
Yeah I know, it's crazy, right?

10:01.922 --> 10:05.722
I mean she seemed perfectly happy
with everything, with me

10:05.723 --> 10:07.323
Huh?  Why wouldn't she be?

10:08.624 --> 10:13.424
You know, um, when two people break up,
you know, nobody did anything wrong

10:13.425 --> 10:16.325
You know, there are some other hard feelings

10:16.326 --> 10:17.726
I feel so relieved

10:18.627 --> 10:19.727
I love Sonoma

10:20.128 --> 10:22.328
Jesse Bates? Are you her lawyer?

10:22.329 --> 10:23.329
Is she here?

10:23.330 --> 10:24.230
I asked you first

10:24.231 --> 10:25.931
Don't let him in!  He stole a car!

10:26.332 --> 10:28.132
Well that would be a different form

10:28.133 --> 10:29.133
Maggie Decker, attorney

10:29.134 --> 10:30.534
It's not even her car

10:30.535 --> 10:32.235
So whose car did you steal?

10:32.236 --> 10:33.136
I didn't steal anyone's car

10:33.137 --> 10:34.137
We had an agreement, Eli

10:34.138 --> 10:34.738
No we didn't

10:34.739 --> 10:36.339
It was an implied covenant

10:36.340 --> 10:38.640
Here they are and they're arguing
You owe me five bucks

10:38.641 --> 10:40.641
Did he or did he not steal a car?

10:40.642 --> 10:41.742
You mean my car?

10:42.343 --> 10:42.843
No, I gave him the car

10:42.844 --> 10:44.944
Um, sir, I'm an attorney

10:44.945 --> 10:45.545
So am I

10:45.546 --> 10:46.146
Me too

10:49.047 --> 10:51.447
You know what?  I just lost interest

10:51.648 --> 10:55.648
Someone wanna put Jesse Bates in the visitors' room
before I shoot the whole gaggle of lawyers?

11:00.949 --> 11:03.449
I hope no one in the bay area 
needs a lawyer this afternoon

11:03.450 --> 11:09.350
Just for the record, you are the Jesse Bates who
assigned Russell's news producer when KNIB fired him

11:09.351 --> 11:11.651
No, but she was when Sam Russell quit

11:11.652 --> 11:15.652
Ms. Bates, without a supena you're under
no obligation to talk to him

11:15.653 --> 11:20.353
Nice try! Since we represent Baywest Media I'd be
happy to extend our services to you as a former employee

11:20.354 --> 11:21.654
What makes you think I need an attorney?

11:21.655 --> 11:23.755
Other than the handcuffs and the jail, I mean

11:23.756 --> 11:24.956
What are you doing in here?

11:24.957 --> 11:27.257
After live television I came up here

11:27.258 --> 11:29.058
Started over, I opened an art gallery

11:29.059 --> 11:32.659
Two weeks ago, a local couple asked
me to sell a painting for them

11:32.660 --> 11:33.560
A Miro

11:33.561 --> 11:34.561
And that's illegal now?

11:34.562 --> 11:37.662
It is when it was stolen by the Nazis 75 years ago

11:37.663 --> 11:39.463
Even if it was why would that line you in jail?

11:39.464 --> 11:43.864
It didn't.  I think it was my refusal to returning
the painting to the sellers that got me in trouble

11:43.865 --> 11:44.865
Where's the painting now?

11:44.866 --> 11:48.166
It turns out that the police are having
a little difficulty locating it

11:48.167 --> 11:50.567
This is fascinating but it's a little off the topic

11:50.568 --> 11:52.868
Actually counselors, is sitting right on the topic

11:52.869 --> 11:56.869
Any attorney is good enough to 
represent the likes of Sam Russell

11:56.870 --> 12:01.070
And Baywest Media have got to be better than whatever public
defender in a little land like Sonoma has to offer

12:01.071 --> 12:02.071
No, wh... what...

12:02.072 --> 12:04.572
I think it would be a conflict of interest for us to represent you

12:04.573 --> 12:09.473
Look, I think you'll find that I've got a case
of amnesia for as long as I'm incarcerated

12:09.474 --> 12:10.874
You find out what I know?

12:10.875 --> 12:11.775
You get me out of jail

12:12.376 --> 12:14.076
I think the four of you can get along
long enough to do that

12:16.177 --> 12:20.077
Very simple; we can get her kicked in a fourth
ammendment violation, she's being detained

12:20.078 --> 12:21.378
Woa, woa, woa, woa... - and we have her out by noon!

12:21.379 --> 12:23.179
She's being held on a civil contempt charge

12:23.180 --> 12:24.780
She didn't comply with the judge's order

12:24.781 --> 12:26.781
A judge she hasn't seen in over 48 hours!

12:26.782 --> 12:27.482
Fourth ammendment!

12:27.483 --> 12:29.983
So what you're saying is, you're just as wrong as Matt?

12:29.984 --> 12:32.284
You wanna repeat that?  Maybe try
to be even more condescending

12:32.285 --> 12:33.685
Together again just like old times!

12:33.686 --> 12:35.986
Who is in charge here anyway?

12:35.987 --> 12:36.687
I am - I am

12:36.688 --> 12:37.688
Son of a bitch!

12:37.689 --> 12:39.889
That was the spa.  They're closed till the end of the week!

12:39.890 --> 12:40.990
Sorry honey

12:41.391 --> 12:42.591
Uhh... what i missed?

12:42.592 --> 12:46.492
Eli trying to come up with different ways to keep
our client in prison for the rest of her life

12:46.493 --> 12:47.793
Oh, I just thought of a new one!

12:47.794 --> 12:49.094
You try the case yourself!

12:49.095 --> 12:54.495
As terrifying as that prospect is we do need a first chair
and since I seem to have the foremost grip on the issues here

12:54.496 --> 12:55.496
If you'd bothered to...

12:55.496 --> 12:57.696
Why don't we just compare recent track records? -
to know that our client actually had to report with me

12:57.697 --> 12:58.797
Wins, losses

12:58.798 --> 12:59.598
Rock, paper, scissors

13:00.799 --> 13:03.399
The three of you!  Rock, paper, scissors for lead counsel

13:04.300 --> 13:05.300
On three

13:06.201 --> 13:07.601
Rock, paper, scissors, shoo!

13:07.602 --> 13:10.902
Admit it Eli! I am undefeated in Rock, Paper, Scissors

13:10.903 --> 13:13.503
You'd think with a name like Stone
you'd play Rock more often

13:14.104 --> 13:15.104
What's the deal Jesse?

13:15.105 --> 13:16.305
You found a coupon?

13:16.306 --> 13:17.706
Four lawyers for the price of one?

13:17.707 --> 13:18.307
All rise!

13:25.008 --> 13:26.208
Lee?

13:26.909 --> 13:28.909
Judge Rappaport

13:30.410 --> 13:31.010
Be seated

13:32.211 --> 13:36.411
Donnie, I want you to be aware of my prior
relationship with counsel

13:36.412 --> 13:38.512
We went to Law school together

13:38.513 --> 13:39.213
Not a problem

13:39.214 --> 13:40.614
You stoop the judge?

13:40.615 --> 13:42.015
She wasn't a judge then

13:42.016 --> 13:44.316
Case S.C.R. 392

13:44.317 --> 13:46.517
Jesse Bates have been charged with
theft by conversion

13:46.518 --> 13:50.218
She's being held in civil contempt
for refusing to turn over property

13:51.319 --> 13:52.019
I'd like to hear motions

13:52.720 --> 13:56.320
We move to dismiss.  That complaint is
defective as it does not alleged taking

13:56.321 --> 14:00.021
An point of fact, the painting was given to
Ms. Bates and therefore cons...

14:00.022 --> 14:00.922
Denied

14:00.923 --> 14:03.123
Conversion doesn't require a taking

14:03.124 --> 14:04.424
It's criminal law 101

14:04.425 --> 14:09.225
Although if I remember correctly the only reason you
passed that class is because you copied my outline

14:10.326 --> 14:13.126
That's uh... stretching the truth of it, but

14:13.127 --> 14:17.127
Move to dismiss on grounds that complainants
are not the actual owners of the painting

14:17.128 --> 14:19.328
Denied!  Four of you and that's 
the best you can come up with?

14:20.129 --> 14:20.829
Is that all you have?

14:21.230 --> 14:22.530
Don't worry. We've got a lot more

14:22.531 --> 14:23.431
I'm afraid that's it your honor

14:24.932 --> 14:28.732
In that case let's move forward to the preliminary
hearing to determine the painting's true ownership

14:28.733 --> 14:29.733
Ms. Bates will remain in custody

14:29.734 --> 14:33.134
I trust everyone will be ready to call
witnesses this afternoon

14:34.235 --> 14:35.435
What did you do to that woman?

14:37.436 --> 14:39.536
Um, can I ask you a question?

14:39.537 --> 14:41.737
I've heard about a couple of different
types of acupuncturists

14:41.738 --> 14:44.238
Some who do a traditional acupuncture

14:44.839 --> 14:49.839
And, uh, then there are some who
do a kind of darker acupuncture

14:50.140 --> 14:51.240
Nurhachi?

14:51.641 --> 14:52.541
Nurhachi?

14:53.342 --> 14:54.442
Your name came up

14:54.443 --> 14:55.443
And a Dr. Chen

14:55.444 --> 14:56.444
Alright Nate

14:58.045 --> 14:59.145
Session's over

15:00.046 --> 15:00.746
What?

15:00.747 --> 15:02.147
I didn't tell you my name!

15:02.748 --> 15:05.948
Let's just say... you don't have the aura for deception

15:05.949 --> 15:07.449
And your brother talks about you a lot

15:09.850 --> 15:11.550
No plus one

15:11.851 --> 15:13.851
Jordan Wethersby... alone

15:14.652 --> 15:15.952
Plus none

15:15.953 --> 15:18.653
Yes I know I RSVP'd for two but

15:19.654 --> 15:20.354
Uh... hold on

15:21.355 --> 15:22.955
Lucille, could you please pick up?

15:22.956 --> 15:23.156
Yes Sir

15:23.157 --> 15:24.157
Everything alright?

15:24.158 --> 15:28.958
Apparently, it now requires an act of congress
to attend a charity event by oneself

15:28.959 --> 15:30.059
But you came to see me

15:30.360 --> 15:31.360
How can I help you?

15:31.361 --> 15:36.061
Well... I've been spending the last 
couple of days making amends

15:36.062 --> 15:38.262
Is part of my program

15:38.263 --> 15:42.563
I make a list of all the people I've 
harmed and I apologize to them

15:42.564 --> 15:43.764
Well that must be a pretty long list

15:44.165 --> 15:45.565
Oh, watch it!

15:45.566 --> 15:46.666
Let me make this easy

15:46.667 --> 15:47.767
You have done nothing

15:47.768 --> 15:48.868
To make amends for

15:48.869 --> 15:50.069
I treated you terrible

15:50.070 --> 15:50.970
You did not

15:50.971 --> 15:51.971
Behind your back

15:53.472 --> 15:56.072
When you almost lost Don Kettner's business

15:56.973 --> 15:59.273
For two months he simply stopped returning my calls

15:59.274 --> 16:00.674
No, he didn't

16:01.175 --> 16:02.575
I didn't put him through

16:02.576 --> 16:06.676
It was like when you'd show up at Positano
and there was never table for you

16:08.477 --> 16:10.277
You never made the reservation

16:10.278 --> 16:14.778
I couldn't stand you knowing my secret,
I, I wanted to punish you

16:17.979 --> 16:19.179
Can you forgive me?

16:20.080 --> 16:20.780
That depends

16:23.181 --> 16:24.081
What are you doing tonight?

16:24.882 --> 16:29.582
It's a Philipe Perrot. The painting's
been in my family over 60 years

16:29.583 --> 16:34.483
It wasn't an easy decision but we were
gonna sell that to pay for the twin's college tuition

16:35.084 --> 16:37.084
We brought it to Ms. Bates,
have it apraised...

16:37.085 --> 16:38.585
Which would be when she stole it?

16:38.586 --> 16:40.486
Objection, counsel is testifying

16:40.487 --> 16:41.887
Nah, I didn't think so

16:42.388 --> 16:43.088
Overruled

16:43.089 --> 16:43.489
Really?

16:47.690 --> 16:52.490
Um, I understand your grandfather 
bought this painting in Paris?

16:52.491 --> 16:54.891
Yes, he was stationed in France during world war II

16:54.892 --> 16:57.992
He bought it as an engagement gift for my grandmother

16:57.993 --> 16:59.793
Uh, do you know the date of purchase?

16:59.794 --> 17:02.694
Grandma was a pack rat, they had the receipt

17:02.695 --> 17:07.494
It's from the Gallery Rue Saint Germaine, December 1944

17:07.496 --> 17:11.896
Are you aware that the art lost register has catalogued
at least four thousand pieces of art

17:11.896 --> 17:14.696
stolen from jewish owners during the holocaust

17:14.698 --> 17:19.198
And that any painting purchased in Europe from
1933 to 1945 is suspect?

17:19.199 --> 17:19.699
Objection

17:19.700 --> 17:20.400
Sustained

17:20.901 --> 17:22.101
You haven't even heard his ground

17:22.102 --> 17:24.801
Sustained.  Are you enjoying Sonoma Matt?

17:24.803 --> 17:32.403
Uh... are you aware that the Gallery Rue Saint Germaine
was a known clearing house for artwork stolen from jewish families?

17:32.404 --> 17:35.104
Objection.  Is this a courtroom or a history class?

17:35.105 --> 17:37.105
That's just a fauxy made up objection

17:37.106 --> 17:40.506
Move on Matt.  I know from experience
you know how to do that

17:42.407 --> 17:45.907
Your honor, is it possible you're
allowing this to get personal?

17:45.908 --> 17:47.308
Oh God!

17:47.309 --> 17:50.709
Maybe considering our history.
You might want to...

17:50.710 --> 17:51.510
Our history?

17:51.511 --> 17:56.411
You mean like how I waited for you
for six hours at an airport after graduation?

17:56.912 --> 17:57.712
What?

17:57.713 --> 18:01.413
We had a romantic jamaican vacation planned

18:01.414 --> 18:03.514
Thought I was getting a ring!

18:03.515 --> 18:06.815
Instead he never showed up, never called

18:07.216 --> 18:09.316
Three months later he emailed

18:09.317 --> 18:11.717
He sent an email!

18:11.718 --> 18:16.118
Saying sorry, I joined the FBI. Oh! How are
things working at the bureau anyway, Matt?

18:16.119 --> 18:17.519
That I can explain

18:17.520 --> 18:19.820
You know what please?  I don't wanna
hear another word out of you

18:19.821 --> 18:20.921
I'm first chair

18:20.922 --> 18:23.122
Not anymore.  I'm holding you in contempt

18:23.123 --> 18:27.523
Actually I've been doing that for the
last ten years, I'm just making it legal

18:27.524 --> 18:29.124
Bailiff, take him

18:33.325 --> 18:35.325
Ok. Who saw that coming?

18:36.926 --> 18:38.426
Rock, paper, scissors, go!

18:39.427 --> 18:42.427
Paper covers rock, I belive that
that would make me new first chair

18:42.428 --> 18:43.728
Ugh!  I suck at this game!

18:43.729 --> 18:45.229
This is unbelievable

18:45.230 --> 18:48.230
I swear she put him in jail just to ruin my getaway!

18:48.231 --> 18:49.531
Taylor, she doesn't even know you

18:49.532 --> 18:51.132
Clearly she knows Matt

18:52.233 --> 18:53.233
Can we get back to business?

18:53.634 --> 18:55.334
Absolutely.  Back to business.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.535
After I get snacks

19:05.336 --> 19:05.936
You OK?

19:07.437 --> 19:08.637
Is this case giving you a headache?

19:09.238 --> 19:10.838
No, I brought it with me from San Francisco

19:13.039 --> 19:15.639
Anyway, the owner's testimony hurt us

19:15.640 --> 19:16.740
Alleged owner

19:16.741 --> 19:18.141
The painting's not really his, remember?

19:18.142 --> 19:21.442
Which is why we need the original
owner so we can establish initial posession

19:21.443 --> 19:24.843
And their testimony would be very compelling
since, you know, they're dead

19:24.844 --> 19:26.044
Any relatives?

19:26.045 --> 19:28.545
One, a grandaughter.  Katie Buckner

19:28.546 --> 19:31.246
But according to her neighbor she's vacationing in Fiji

19:31.247 --> 19:33.247
So we stall until she gets back

19:33.248 --> 19:34.548
Putting Jesse on the stand?

19:34.549 --> 19:35.049
Yeah

19:35.050 --> 19:38.050
Do you have any idea how we
can distinguish Orcan vs. Taylor?

19:38.651 --> 19:40.651
Taylor's gonna sue that spa now?

19:40.852 --> 19:44.252
Orcan vs. Taylor!  Come on, the 
controlling precedent in California?

19:44.253 --> 19:47.053
Even if we prove the painting was stolen by Nazis

19:47.054 --> 19:49.054
Orcan says the new owners don't have to return it

19:49.055 --> 19:51.655
There's a statute to limitations forge recovery

19:53.156 --> 19:54.856
Ok, new strategy

19:54.857 --> 19:58.557
Hope the DA Barney Fife is not
as good a lawyer as you are

20:00.258 --> 20:02.758
In my old life I worked in TV journalism

20:02.759 --> 20:06.359
I once produced a piece about stolen Nazi art

20:06.360 --> 20:09.960
And I pretty much memorized the whole art loss registry

20:09.961 --> 20:12.661
So, when I sat down to apraise this painting

20:12.662 --> 20:17.062
I realized I was looking at Miro's Lady with Locket

20:17.063 --> 20:22.263
Stolen from the Buckner's a jewish family
who had fled the Nazi Germany in 1933

20:22.264 --> 20:25.364
Objection!  I don't see any Buckner's in this room

20:25.365 --> 20:26.065
Overruled

20:26.066 --> 20:30.666
The only surviving family member is the
grandaughter and we haven't been able to reach her

20:30.667 --> 20:33.167
Eric Danver's family paid for this painting,
they have the receipt

20:33.168 --> 20:35.968
And I'm sure they didn't know they
were buying stolen property

20:37.069 --> 20:38.169
It's your witness

20:38.170 --> 20:39.870
Just so I'm clear

20:41.571 --> 20:45.671
Eric Danvers didn't steal this painting, his
family didn't steal this painting

20:45.672 --> 20:49.372
And to your knowledge even the dealer they
bought it from didn't steal this painting

20:49.373 --> 20:51.073
Is there a question? Or even a point?

20:51.074 --> 20:55.974
My question and my point is, how many years back do
we go to rectify past and justices?

20:55.975 --> 20:57.875
Should we get Manhattan back to the indians?

20:57.876 --> 20:58.376
Your honor!

20:58.377 --> 21:01.777
Can you even prove that this is 
the Buckner's missing painting?

21:01.778 --> 21:03.778
It's described in the registry

21:03.779 --> 21:05.679
Described?  Is there a photo?

21:05.680 --> 21:07.180
No... but...

21:07.181 --> 21:09.281
You said the painting is called Lady with Locket?

21:09.282 --> 21:11.282
Do you know how many ladies Miro painted?

21:11.283 --> 21:12.283
Your honor!

21:12.784 --> 21:13.884
Uh, yes

21:13.885 --> 21:15.785
Lawyer number 4

21:15.786 --> 21:18.386
With all due respect what kind 
of court are you running here?

21:18.387 --> 21:18.987
Taylor

21:18.988 --> 21:23.988
You're cross examining witnesses, you threw our
co-counsel in jail because he broke up with you!

21:23.989 --> 21:26.589
Unless you wanna join him dial it back, counsel

21:26.590 --> 21:30.090
Not if you recuse yourself from this case,
you're the one who has to make peace with the past

21:35.591 --> 21:37.091
Hi honey! How was work?

21:44.592 --> 21:45.392
Patty!

21:45.393 --> 21:46.893
You look lovely!

21:46.894 --> 21:48.494
Don't look so surprised!

21:48.495 --> 21:53.095
This isn't surprised.  This is happy to see a friendly face
who's looking at me with something other than pity

21:53.096 --> 21:55.296
I almost called and said I couldn't make it

21:55.297 --> 21:56.897
I almost left the exact same message

21:56.898 --> 21:59.998
Then I thought about how I stayed in the house six months

21:59.999 --> 22:02.999
After feeling I sprayed up just feeling sorry for myself

22:03.000 --> 22:05.700
Until my daughter Angela kicked my ass out the door

22:05.701 --> 22:08.701
Told me don't come home until you have some fun

22:09.402 --> 22:13.602
It's a zoo benefit, I'm not sure 
fun is in the evening agenda

22:13.603 --> 22:18.503
What's important is you're out and
besides, you brought the fun with you

22:22.404 --> 22:23.104
Jordan!

22:23.105 --> 22:26.105
Ellen!  You're here!  I thought 
you said you wouldn't be attending

22:26.106 --> 22:27.806
I said I wouldn't be attending with you

22:29.407 --> 22:30.807
That's a lovely dress Patty

22:30.808 --> 22:31.408
Thank you Ellen

22:31.409 --> 22:33.709
You look particularly well-preserved tonight

22:33.710 --> 22:35.710
Sweetie, we're at table 10

22:37.811 --> 22:38.811
Jordan!

22:38.812 --> 22:39.712
Jeff!

22:41.813 --> 22:43.613
Give me a minute.  Ellen!

22:43.614 --> 22:46.614
You could have given him a heads up

22:46.615 --> 22:48.015
Oh, I know I could have

22:50.316 --> 22:56.516
We have a long list of nicknames in the office
for you, so sorry to see you earning everyone of them

23:01.317 --> 23:02.417
Are you alright?

23:02.418 --> 23:04.718
Uh, I know I promised you dinner but

23:05.819 --> 23:08.819
Would you be terribly crushed if we find it elsewhere?

23:08.820 --> 23:10.220
Oh, of course not

23:11.821 --> 23:12.621
Thank you

23:13.622 --> 23:15.222
Don't reject this trade off

23:15.223 --> 23:20.123
What if Taylor was right when she asked
the judge to recuse herself?

23:20.124 --> 23:21.924
We could file to have her removed

23:21.925 --> 23:24.525
Then we're stuck here at least another week

23:24.526 --> 23:27.026
Well... there are worst places to be stuck

23:27.027 --> 23:28.827
More wine?

23:28.828 --> 23:30.228
I think you finished it all

23:31.129 --> 23:32.529
Not by myself I didn't

23:33.330 --> 23:36.630
Speaking of you, you were really good today

23:37.731 --> 23:40.431
I forgot what it's like to be on your side of the isle

23:40.432 --> 23:43.332
Well let me remind you we usually ended up fighting

23:44.233 --> 23:47.233
Then let me remind you that you 
were always the one who started it

23:47.234 --> 23:47.934
Are you kidding?

23:47.935 --> 23:50.435
First time I met you you were 
interviewing for a job at the firm

23:50.436 --> 23:56.136
And you accused me of being a   ***  drunk
who sold out his principles for seven figures and a car

23:56.137 --> 23:57.837
I did, and you were

23:57.838 --> 23:58.338
Yeah

23:58.339 --> 24:00.139
But that wasn't the first time you met me

24:00.840 --> 24:01.540
Excuse me?

24:01.541 --> 24:05.341
Oh God! I didn't mean to...

24:06.242 --> 24:11.342
We, we met at law school

24:12.543 --> 24:15.143
How much did you drink? 
We didn't go to law school together

24:15.744 --> 24:16.944
Not even at the same time

24:16.945 --> 24:19.945
University of Chicago, 5 years ago

24:19.946 --> 24:25.546
I was uh, second year and I tagged along with my
roommate to this summer social recruitment dinner

24:25.547 --> 24:32.247
Where a very slick, very shallow, very smart
attorney from WPK in San Francisco spoke

24:34.448 --> 24:36.148
I remember, you were there?

24:36.449 --> 24:37.649
Yeah

24:37.650 --> 24:39.150
Did we talk?

24:39.151 --> 24:41.051
No, not at the dinner

24:41.052 --> 24:43.752
But afterwards...

24:44.753 --> 24:46.053
At the karaoke bar?

24:47.354 --> 24:49.754
You were the girl I wouldn't get off the stage!

24:49.755 --> 24:52.355
Lawschool Maggie loved the karaoke

24:53.256 --> 24:56.356
And by the way, I did get off the stage
when I tried to get you to sing!

24:56.357 --> 24:57.857
I, uh... you remember what I sang?

24:57.858 --> 24:58.758
Some George MIchael song?

24:58.759 --> 25:00.159
Uh!  Yeah!

25:00.160 --> 25:02.960
And yeah, I'm fairly certain that's why he
didn't tour in America for five years

25:05.061 --> 25:09.361
In fact, let's see if you've got 
any better the last five years

25:16.062 --> 25:17.762
Oh, come on! Everybody know the words

25:18.163 --> 25:20.463
Red red wine you make me feel so fine

25:20.464 --> 25:22.664
You keep me rocking all of the time

25:32.565 --> 25:34.165
I've actually had this fantasy

25:34.166 --> 25:37.866
You, me, prison

25:38.267 --> 25:40.367
But there are more hot captive women

25:40.368 --> 25:43.068
And maybe a steamy group shower

25:43.069 --> 25:47.169
Yeah, that's exactly the romantic 
getaway I've been dreaming of too

25:49.270 --> 25:51.270
I should probably explain about Lee, huh?

25:51.271 --> 25:55.571
I knew who you were when I got involved with you
that's why they call it the past, Matt

25:55.572 --> 25:57.972
Did you just quote Charlie Sheen?

25:58.973 --> 26:01.973
I can live with your baggage just as 
long as you don't try to unpack it

26:01.974 --> 26:03.174
Wow!

26:04.075 --> 26:08.275
Ok and right back at you

26:08.276 --> 26:09.076
Excuse me?

26:09.077 --> 26:12.877
Taylor, we drove up here with your baggage
eating gorp in the backseat

26:12.878 --> 26:17.478
He's your ex-fiance, the love of your life
and I have to watch you go off every morning

26:17.479 --> 26:21.379
Knowing you're gonna spend 10, 12 hours with him

26:22.980 --> 26:27.080
Pfff, I never... you're right

26:27.081 --> 26:30.281
About all of it, except the part about Eli
being the love of my life

26:30.282 --> 26:35.782
I tought he was but... I was wrong

26:37.983 --> 26:39.883
And that position has yet to be filled

26:42.384 --> 26:43.884
You're taking applications?

26:46.185 --> 26:47.185
Absolutely

26:57.986 --> 26:58.786
Wait wait wait

26:59.587 --> 27:00.587
What are we doing?

27:01.588 --> 27:02.988
You had a lot to drink

27:03.089 --> 27:04.689
Well that's just enough

27:04.690 --> 27:06.290
We both have

27:06.291 --> 27:08.591
Just, I don't wanna mess things up

27:08.592 --> 27:09.692
You know?

27:09.693 --> 27:11.893
Things are gonne get messed up 
whether we want them to or not

27:12.894 --> 27:13.894
Look, I don't need you protecting me

27:15.295 --> 27:16.095
Just tell me this

27:18.396 --> 27:19.896
Where do you wanna be right now?

27:21.497 --> 27:22.097
Here

27:29.898 --> 27:31.498
You do realize I have a phone

27:31.499 --> 27:33.699
I left you messages, never called me back

27:33.700 --> 27:36.200
That's because we've already had this conversation

27:37.001 --> 27:39.201
I can't tell Eli about the book

27:40.502 --> 27:42.002
Then tell me

27:43.903 --> 27:45.003
I spoke with Dr. Lee

27:45.004 --> 27:46.904
She told me about Nurhachi

27:46.905 --> 27:51.405
About a kind of acupuncture that literally
causes physiological damage

27:51.406 --> 27:52.906
And that you practiced it

27:52.907 --> 27:54.107
Only twice

27:54.108 --> 27:55.208
On Eli?

27:56.309 --> 27:57.309
Once with Eli

27:57.310 --> 27:58.510
And the other time?

28:00.611 --> 28:01.311
Come on Frank

28:02.712 --> 28:04.512
Whatever it is you can tell me

28:05.213 --> 28:08.213
I mean, we're, we're practically family here

28:09.414 --> 28:10.614
That's ironic

28:13.815 --> 28:16.215
The other time I performed the Nurhachi technique

28:18.916 --> 28:19.916
I did it on your father

28:21.317 --> 28:24.417
It was more than 10 years ago back when
I was working for him in his TV shop

28:24.418 --> 28:28.118
Your dad was in pretty bad shape with
the visions he was having

28:28.119 --> 28:29.119
So all the more reason not...

28:29.120 --> 28:30.920
Told me he hadn't slept in a week

28:30.921 --> 28:35.921
There were these voices in his head, images,
it was plaguing him Nate

28:35.922 --> 28:39.922
He was as close to a complete break as...
I'd ever seen in anyone

28:39.923 --> 28:46.523
I, I was young and naive enough to think that the
cure couldn't possibly be worse than the desease

28:47.224 --> 28:48.024
Did it help?

28:49.225 --> 28:50.425
I thought so, you know?  At first

28:50.426 --> 28:55.226
It gave him relieve, allowed him to 
see whatever he needed to see

28:56.227 --> 28:57.227
But...

28:59.628 --> 29:00.628
Something happened

29:01.329 --> 29:03.629
He, he died less than a week later

29:10.930 --> 29:11.630
Thank you

29:16.131 --> 29:19.831
When you said you were taking me to dinner
I assumed there'd be table cloths

29:16.632 --> 29:25.332
You are about to feast on the best cheeseburguer in
San Francisco. Possibly the Western Seaboard

29:25.333 --> 29:27.933
Why didn't you say something to her?

29:27.934 --> 29:30.534
Parading her date in front of you like that

29:30.535 --> 29:33.435
Why are you letting this woman walk all over you?

29:33.436 --> 29:35.336
I'm not letting her walk all over me

29:35.337 --> 29:39.937
The divorce, the way she treated you tonight,
you're living in a hotel fot god sakes!

29:39.938 --> 29:42.238
There are worst places to do one's penance

29:44.039 --> 29:45.039
You lost me

29:45.040 --> 29:47.740
I cheated on Taylor's mother with Ellen for months

29:47.741 --> 29:49.641
Lying to her face about it

29:49.642 --> 29:52.142
Well then make it up to Susan, not Ellen

29:52.143 --> 29:55.943
And when Susan finally found out,
when my lies stopped working

29:55.944 --> 29:58.544
I tried to convince her that it was her fault

29:59.545 --> 30:02.745
If she'd been a better wife, a 
better mother, a better person

30:02.746 --> 30:04.446
I never would've strayed

30:04.447 --> 30:09.847
What's happened with Ellen is... 
just my poultry coming home to roost

30:10.648 --> 30:12.348
What a load of crap!

30:12.349 --> 30:15.749
Well, no need to be bashful Patty, 
please!  Speak you mind

30:15.750 --> 30:18.050
Do you remember what I'm doing here tonight?

30:18.051 --> 30:20.451
Why I agreed to come here with you?

30:21.352 --> 30:22.652
You were making amends

30:24.053 --> 30:26.653
Maybe it's time you did the same

30:47.254 --> 30:48.054
Eli?

30:51.355 --> 30:52.155
Hey!

30:54.256 --> 30:55.256
Hi

30:55.257 --> 30:56.257
Hey

30:56.258 --> 30:59.458
Are you pretending to be asleep just now?

30:59.459 --> 31:00.259
What?

31:00.260 --> 31:00.860
No

31:02.161 --> 31:08.161
I was... um, maybe, I don't know what I was thinking

31:10.362 --> 31:11.962
Yeah, like last night, right?

31:11.963 --> 31:13.363
Exactly

31:13.364 --> 31:15.064
Except I was kidding

31:15.965 --> 31:17.665
Yeah, me too, I'm kidding

31:17.666 --> 31:17.866
Eli

31:17.867 --> 31:19.067
Hey, no!

31:19.568 --> 31:26.468
Look, last night was great but I don't think
I've been completely honest with you

31:26.469 --> 31:31.469
About myself.  I was in the hospital over the weekend

31:31.470 --> 31:32.370
Are you ok?

31:32.371 --> 31:41.171
Yeah, well no... um... I was bleeding and
they found a second aneurism

31:41.172 --> 31:43.872
Oh... oh...

31:43.873 --> 31:46.573
I just haven't given myself any time to think about that

31:46.574 --> 31:50.074
So I was so happy to get out of town, you know?

31:50.075 --> 31:51.575
Change of scenery

31:52.876 --> 31:53.776
And then last night

31:53.777 --> 31:57.577
Tell me you're not about to use your
aneurism to justify what happened last night

31:57.578 --> 32:00.378
No!  You're missing the point

32:05.179 --> 32:06.379
Maggie Decker

32:07.480 --> 32:08.380
You're kidding!

32:09.081 --> 32:11.881
Well that's terrific! Um, yeah we'll see you in court

32:12.482 --> 32:13.782
We have our witness

32:15.383 --> 32:19.083
Katie Buckner the grandaughter 
just flew into town an hour ago

32:19.084 --> 32:21.184
We got her?  That's great!

32:21.185 --> 32:23.585
Can... can we just talk about this?

32:23.586 --> 32:24.386
That we just did

32:25.787 --> 32:28.987
Look, why don't you pretend to be 
asleep again so I can get dressed?

32:32.888 --> 32:36.088
My grandparents got separated while escaping Nazi Germany

32:36.889 --> 32:38.889
My grandfather got out with my mother

32:38.890 --> 32:41.090
My grandmother, she didn't make it

32:41.091 --> 32:43.891
After the war my grandfather went back to try to find her

32:44.592 --> 32:49.892
She was gone, and everything we owned,
including the painting, had be stolen

32:49.893 --> 32:52.793
So, just to be clear, you've never actually seen this painting

32:52.794 --> 32:53.294
Never

32:53.895 --> 32:54.895
Would you like to?

33:09.096 --> 33:12.096
Oh my God!  Well, it's beautiful!

33:13.097 --> 33:15.997
My mother, she used to talk about this painting all the time

33:17.098 --> 33:19.298
The stories my grandfather told her about it

33:19.299 --> 33:22.299
When did your grandfather stopped looking for the painting

33:22.300 --> 33:24.700
Never.  He never stopped.

33:24.701 --> 33:29.201
He didn't care about Miro or what the
painting was worth, to him it was priceless

33:29.202 --> 33:31.502
To him, it was a piece of her

33:32.403 --> 33:35.703
Emotion aside Your Honor, this isn't evidence

33:35.704 --> 33:38.604
Look at Katie and look at the woman in the painting

33:38.605 --> 33:40.505
They're practically identical

33:40.506 --> 33:42.706
I'm sorry I'm not familiar with the legal look-alike test

33:42.707 --> 33:45.007
Katie, show the judge your necklace

33:49.208 --> 33:53.808
My grandmother gave this to my mom 
in Germany and my mom gave it to me

33:53.809 --> 33:56.109
Your Honor at this time I would like to move to dismiss

33:56.110 --> 33:58.710
And I would very much like to grant your motion counsel, but

33:59.711 --> 34:04.411
Last night I came across a little precedent 
called Orcan vs. Taylor... heard of it?

34:04.412 --> 34:06.012
Under the 9th circuit ruling

34:06.013 --> 34:09.112
An allegedly rightful owner has to file within 3 years

34:09.114 --> 34:10.214
We're not bound by this decision, Your Honor...

34:10.215 --> 34:11.915
An after case holds estatute of limitations

34:11.916 --> 34:13.616
...weren't triggered until

34:14.117 --> 34:15.117
I don't think I want it

34:16.018 --> 34:18.018
Katie, this belongs to your family

34:18.018 --> 34:19.719
My family is dead Mr. Stone

34:20.719 --> 34:22.620
And this painting can't bring them back

34:23.420 --> 34:26.621
If you want to sell the painting 
Mr. Danvers, I'm OK with it

34:26.621 --> 34:32.322
All I ask is that you sell it to a museum so that
people can see it and hear the story

34:33.422 --> 34:35.123
And so that I can visit it once in a while

34:45.824 --> 34:47.524
OK Bonnie and Clyde, wake up

34:49.725 --> 34:52.125
Great accommodations

34:52.126 --> 34:55.726
One complaint!  The mattresses are a little stiff

34:58.527 --> 34:59.627
Thank you

35:01.428 --> 35:05.328
It's possible I may have let myself get a little carried away

35:05.829 --> 35:06.429
It's possible

35:07.230 --> 35:07.830
What?

35:08.431 --> 35:10.831
Matt has something he wants to say to you

35:13.832 --> 35:14.632
I'm sorry

35:16.133 --> 35:19.833
I wasn't the guy you deserved me to be
and it was easier for me to lie to you

35:20.734 --> 35:21.934
Than admit that

35:22.635 --> 35:28.235
It's been ten years... I think this statute
of limitations has long since run

35:33.136 --> 35:34.936
Not exactly the result we were going for

35:35.337 --> 35:38.137
We were out to prove the painting's source

35:38.138 --> 35:39.738
With that comes the right to decide what to do with it

35:40.139 --> 35:43.939
With those kind of principles I'm really looking forward
to hearing what you have to say in the Russell case

35:44.640 --> 35:46.940
Something really whistler-blowery would be nice

35:47.241 --> 35:48.541
Maggie didn't tell you

35:49.942 --> 35:50.442
Maggie?

35:51.243 --> 35:53.343
I don't have anything to say, Mr. Stone

35:54.044 --> 35:59.544
All the decisions about the hiring and firing of an on-air
reporter like Sam they happened over my head

35:59.545 --> 36:03.245
However, that doesn't mean that I didn't
care about what happened to Sam

36:03.246 --> 36:09.946
And it doesn't mean that I didn't leave Baywest Media
with a whole mess of emails, memos, documents

36:09.947 --> 36:15.647
I never had the heart to read them but, it wouldn't surprised
me if that there were some fairly useful things in there

36:15.648 --> 36:16.548
Useful to who?

36:16.749 --> 36:17.649
You're the lawyer

36:17.850 --> 36:20.750
Jessie, I would very much like to see those documents

36:20.751 --> 36:24.151
No problem, I already gave Maggie
the combination to my storage unit

36:24.152 --> 36:25.552
So Maggie has everything

36:25.553 --> 36:26.753
She came to see me this morning

36:26.754 --> 36:29.654
Said she had to get back early, 
you guys work together, right?

36:29.655 --> 36:30.855
Not so much, no

36:30.856 --> 36:32.856
Oh, I'm sorry, I just thought...

36:33.957 --> 36:35.157
You seemed like a good team

36:39.358 --> 36:43.658
Malcolm X, Sol Yunitzen , Mandela, 
what do they have in common?

36:43.659 --> 36:47.459
Wait, let me guess, posters I had up on my college dorm?

36:47.460 --> 36:49.760
They've all done hard time in prison

36:49.761 --> 36:50.661
Just like us

36:51.462 --> 36:52.262
We're in that club now

36:52.963 --> 36:55.663
Who'd knew a night behind bars was all we needed?

36:56.064 --> 36:57.864
Come on Maggie, it's me again, pick up

36:58.665 --> 37:00.365
Hey, what you guys do last night anyway?

37:00.366 --> 37:01.966
Nothing, we worked on the case

37:01.967 --> 37:02.767
Why?

37:02.768 --> 37:05.868
Generally I have to sleep with a woman
to get her to flee town so fast

37:07.669 --> 37:08.669
Try her again

37:38.470 --> 37:44.170
Yes, Golden, Colorado, the number for Susan Bransford

37:44.471 --> 37:45.971
This is Maggie, leave a message

37:45.972 --> 37:48.972
OK, this is like the fifth message I've left, Maggie so, um

37:48.973 --> 37:50.573
There's not gonna be another one

37:52.474 --> 37:53.874
That's a lie, there will be another one

37:53.875 --> 37:55.475
And then there'll be one after that

37:55.476 --> 37:56.476
And one after that

37:56.477 --> 37:57.277
So...

37:58.578 --> 37:59.578
That better be you

38:06.379 --> 38:08.879
And it's not you.  Uh, just please call me back

38:12.480 --> 38:13.780
Since when do you two hang out together?

38:16.381 --> 38:17.581
This makes me worried

38:17.782 --> 38:19.082
You need to hear this

38:22.883 --> 38:23.683
Frank

38:26.684 --> 38:28.684
I kept a copy of you father's journal

38:30.885 --> 38:37.785
So, uh, so last month when I, when I asked you
what was in the book, when I... begged you

38:37.786 --> 38:38.586
Eli

38:38.587 --> 38:41.187
You looked me right in the eye 
and you told me it was gone

38:41.188 --> 38:42.488
He was trying to protect you

38:42.489 --> 38:45.289
Oh, yeah? Wai... you knew?

38:45.890 --> 38:46.890
Yes

38:46.891 --> 38:47.791
And you didn't tell me?

38:51.392 --> 38:54.992
So what, you were trying to... 
OK you were trying to protect me too

38:54.993 --> 38:56.993
Alright, OK, protect me from what?

38:56.994 --> 39:03.294
I knew if I told you about the book it'd the more
reason for you to ask me to show you the dark truth

39:03.295 --> 39:04.295
Perform the Nurhachi

39:04.296 --> 39:07.096
Maybe! But that would've been my decision Frank!

39:07.097 --> 39:11.297
Yeah, if I wanna roll the dice on a
second aneurism or third or fourth

39:11.298 --> 39:14.198
Yeah, it's your choice, it's your life, you're right Eli

39:14.199 --> 39:14.599
Thank you

39:14.600 --> 39:17.200
But if you're gonna make that kind of choice
then you need to know the truth

39:18.001 --> 39:18.501
All of it

39:19.602 --> 39:20.302
What truth?

39:26.303 --> 39:28.403
I performed the Nurhachi once before

39:33.504 --> 39:34.404
On your father

39:36.105 --> 39:39.805
When I warned you it was dangerous...
I was speaking from experience

39:42.406 --> 39:44.406
So, wh.. what...

39:44.807 --> 39:48.607
The week after I did the Nurhachi on your dad he

39:52.108 --> 39:53.308
He had his heartattack

39:54.509 --> 39:56.609
I'm so sorry Eli, I, I didn't know

39:56.610 --> 39:59.010
That's how dangerous this is, Eli

39:59.511 --> 40:00.511
That's why you have to stop

40:04.212 --> 40:05.012
Just get out

40:05.413 --> 40:05.813
What?

40:06.314 --> 40:09.514
I can't even look at you guys 
right now, just... just go!

40:09.515 --> 40:10.415
Eli

40:10.416 --> 40:11.416
I said get out
