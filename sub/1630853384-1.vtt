[static crackling]

00:46.416 --> 00:49.791
["Wedding March" playing]

01:25.416 --> 01:29.416
Do you, Marta,
take the here present Zac Efron

01:29.500 --> 01:31.541
to love him and honour him?

01:31.625 --> 01:34.041
-[music stops]
-Uh, no, no, no!

01:34.125 --> 01:36.791
Zac was the one I married last week!

01:36.875 --> 01:39.833
Today it should've been Beckham!

01:39.916 --> 01:42.000
["Sul più bello" playing]

02:52.500 --> 02:54.125
11 YEARS LATER

03:01.541 --> 03:04.708
[Marta] You know all those fairy tales
little girls get told?

03:05.208 --> 03:08.541
About the ugly duckling
that will one day turn into a swan

03:08.625 --> 03:11.583
and the caterpillars
that will eventually become butterflies.

03:13.375 --> 03:15.500
Well, in the end,

03:17.166 --> 03:18.708
I stayed a caterpillar.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.916
But don't feel sorry for me.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.291
Because believe me,
the worst is yet to come.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.375
[bright piano music playing]

03:26.458 --> 03:28.666
-Fuck, it's humongous!
-[bags thud]

03:28.750 --> 03:32.250
-[Marta] Luckily, I have my friends.
-I'll take the biggest room, then.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.916
[Marta] Jacopo.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.000
Jacopo is not fashionable.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.083
Jacopo is fashion.

03:40.583 --> 03:43.083
Since an early age, his mission was clear.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.916
To fight bad taste.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.333
[woman] What do you think?

03:46.416 --> 03:49.666
[Jacopo] Mum, better
with the ballerina pumps.

03:49.750 --> 03:50.875
Try these on.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.041
[bright music continues playing]

04:00.083 --> 04:01.875
No way are you having the biggest room.

04:01.958 --> 04:04.375
Well, actually, I can.
I'm the only man, you know.

04:06.375 --> 04:07.208
[bags thud]

04:08.250 --> 04:09.875
Hey, man-child,

04:09.958 --> 04:12.750
when you want a rematch
at arm wrestling, let me know.

04:14.416 --> 04:15.625
[Marta] Federica.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.750
If you call her "Fede,"
she'll headbutt you.

04:18.833 --> 04:21.625
Well, honey, you never tell us anything.

04:21.708 --> 04:23.000
How's school going?

04:23.083 --> 04:25.916
[Marta] She came out
when she was, like, 13.

04:26.416 --> 04:28.041
Well, Anna and I are together now.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.041
[Marta] She's always been delicate.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.375
Her poor parents.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.625
But what about that cute little boy you--

04:33.708 --> 04:35.958
The one who's always with you.
What's his name?

04:36.041 --> 04:37.083
-Jacopo.
-Jacopo.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.500
He's dating Matteo.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.166
[Marta] At least
they can console themselves

04:41.250 --> 04:43.708
knowing that they've raised
a maths genius.

04:44.583 --> 04:45.583
MONEY

04:45.666 --> 04:49.041
Looks like somebody
has yet to put any money in the kitty.

04:49.125 --> 04:52.458
[Marta] She invented a method
to count cards in poker.

04:52.541 --> 04:55.708
She's cleaning out
every illegal gambling den in town.

04:55.791 --> 04:57.750
CUSHIONS
FEDERICA - KITCHEN

04:57.833 --> 04:59.958
So we were saying, the bedrooms?

05:00.041 --> 05:03.125
Okay. Let's make a list of the rooms
with the pros and cons of each.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.833
-[laughs, sighs]
-[Marta] I love lists.

05:04.916 --> 05:07.333
Lists are life.

05:07.416 --> 05:09.291
[both] To hell with your lists.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.708
[bright instrumental music playing]

05:13.833 --> 05:15.000
[Jacopo] Go!

05:17.500 --> 05:18.625
[Marta exclaims]

05:20.291 --> 05:22.000
[coughing and gasping]

05:22.083 --> 05:24.958
-Ah, it's the dust.
-[Federica] Where's the nebuliser?

05:28.208 --> 05:29.750
[Marta continues coughing]

05:29.833 --> 05:32.500
[Marta] In the end,
I lost the biggest room.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.458
But don't feel sorry for me.

05:35.541 --> 05:37.583
The worst is yet to come.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.416
-[nebuliser hissing]
-[Marta] But it won't be long.

05:40.916 --> 05:44.875
My parents died when I was three.
A car crash.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.208
They're the ones who left me this house

05:48.791 --> 05:50.541
and a rare genetic disease

05:50.625 --> 05:52.875
I'll never be able
to thank them enough for.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.500
Mucoviscidosis.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.750
Nothing too dramatic.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.916
But if you don't take enzymes
with every meal,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.125
use the nebuliser,
do respiratory physiotherapy

06:04.208 --> 06:06.375
and avoid damp places full of germs,

06:06.458 --> 06:10.166
your lungs fill up with mucus,
you get an infection and, well,

06:10.250 --> 06:11.666
you die.

06:12.416 --> 06:15.458
This is the moment
when you can feel sorry for me.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.833
To sum it up,
have you seen all those movies

06:18.916 --> 06:21.291
where the heroine has a terminal illness,

06:21.375 --> 06:23.416
but despite the chemo and the respirator,

06:23.500 --> 06:26.250
she's a total babe
and is dating the coolest guy in school?

06:26.333 --> 06:29.333
-[music stops abruptly]
-[Marta] Well, that ain't my movie.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.583
[indistinct chatter]

06:31.666 --> 06:33.958
[footsteps approaching]

06:34.041 --> 06:36.500
Hey, guys. Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.708
-[Jacopo sighs]
-[both] Okay.

06:38.791 --> 06:39.833
Marta.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.375
Come in.

06:41.875 --> 06:45.125
No, come on, guys. You know the rules.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.708
You two wait out here.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.041
-[quirky music playing]
-[doctor] So, Marta, how do you feel?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.875
Had any other episodes?

06:52.958 --> 06:54.500
No, not that I recall.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.208
Ah, yes. The other day,
I had an episode of catarrhal coughing.

07:00.291 --> 07:02.333
But I'm of the opinion
it was just the dust.

07:02.416 --> 07:05.250
You see, finally, the house
my parents left me has become available.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.958
We've only now just managed to move in.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.833
-You couldn't believe the state it--
-[doctor] Listen, Marta.

07:09.916 --> 07:13.750
I've made the decision to interrupt
the therapy we were trying up to now.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.833
Why?

07:15.333 --> 07:16.541
I am cured?

07:16.625 --> 07:18.791
[laughs]

07:18.875 --> 07:20.875
Come on. It's just a bit of humour.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.458
So what's it mean?

07:23.541 --> 07:25.708
It means that it didn't work
this time either.

07:25.791 --> 07:28.416
-[sombre music playing]
-Doesn't it, Doctor?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
[doctor] Mm-hmm.

07:31.458 --> 07:32.458
How long do I have left?

07:32.541 --> 07:34.291
-[both] What the fuck?
-Shh!

07:34.375 --> 07:35.875
Just let him answer.

07:36.583 --> 07:41.083
You see, for patients
who have mucoviscidosis, time's relative.

07:41.833 --> 07:44.500
What matters most is your attitude.

07:44.583 --> 07:48.250
The large or even the smaller goals
that you can achieve

07:48.333 --> 07:50.958
will assist us to gain some time for you.

07:51.041 --> 07:54.208
So just remember, keep your head up.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.541
Thank you, Doctor.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.833
Seriously, you've opened up
a world for me.

07:58.916 --> 08:02.458
Too bad I, uh,
really have to go back to work right now.

08:02.541 --> 08:03.625
[chuckles]

08:09.250 --> 08:10.583
[both chuckle awkwardly]

08:10.666 --> 08:12.666
[quirky music playing]

08:14.875 --> 08:18.416
-Good morning, little Marta.
-Good morning, big Ahmed.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.458
[purse thuds]

08:34.625 --> 08:35.791
[knocking on door]

08:36.541 --> 08:39.166
-Where have you been, then?
-[Marta] At the doctor's.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.875
Chill out. It's nothing contagious.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.125
Now, look here.

08:44.208 --> 08:47.000
You'll take care of the offers today.
Come on.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.958
-They're waiting for you downstairs.
-If I really have to.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.458
[director chuckles]

09:01.333 --> 09:02.208
[clears throat]

09:02.916 --> 09:05.000
One, two, three.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.041
Testing. [makes popping sound]

09:08.750 --> 09:11.041
[sultry music playing]

09:11.125 --> 09:12.666
[seductively] Good morning.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.916

09:15.000 --> 09:17.875
is at a whopping 40% off.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.666
Organic, locally-sourced green olives
are 30% off.

09:21.750 --> 09:22.875
Hurry.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.041
The offer ends tonight.

09:25.958 --> 09:26.791

09:26.875 --> 09:29.000
-[sultry music fades]
-[tapping on door]

09:34.416 --> 09:37.000
I'M DYING TO MEET YOU!
MARIO

09:37.083 --> 09:38.041
[Marta chuckles]

09:41.208 --> 09:42.250
Dear Mario,

09:42.333 --> 09:44.291
you end up on the wall as well.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.083
WAILING WALL

09:47.166 --> 09:49.416
-[quirky music playing]
-Yes!

09:50.208 --> 09:51.041
No!

09:51.916 --> 09:52.833
[gags]

09:53.500 --> 09:55.916
[giggles wildly] Oh my!

09:56.000 --> 10:00.125
-Jacopo, I think I'm in love with you.
-I'm gay. And I'll remind you, so are you.

10:00.208 --> 10:04.625
[Federica scoffs] Doesn't your mother
notice you steal her clothes?

10:04.708 --> 10:05.708
[Marta] Ew!

10:07.625 --> 10:09.375
[Jacopo] Sorry to have to tell you,

10:09.458 --> 10:11.750
but surely the Internet
is not the right place for therapy.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.333
Actually, I'm on Tinder.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.583
Uh, you heard the doctor.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.333
Having clear objectives
gives me more time.

10:18.416 --> 10:21.416
-What are you talking about?
-[Marta] Shh! I'm working!

10:21.500 --> 10:23.041
We're in a new neighbourhood.

10:23.541 --> 10:26.500
[giggling] New and exciting geolocation!

10:26.583 --> 10:29.958
Yeah. New hot arseholes
who can also knock you back, then.

10:30.041 --> 10:31.166
[Marta] Mm.

10:31.250 --> 10:34.000
Superb. So then, what now?

10:34.083 --> 10:37.541
-[Federica] It's my ex's birthday party.
-Which one are you referring to exactly?

10:37.625 --> 10:39.958
You're a moron. Come on, Julia.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.708
Sure, right. Which one of the many?

10:41.791 --> 10:43.250
What are you saying?

10:43.333 --> 10:44.625
Julia, the salesgirl from Zara.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.000
Julia, the actress.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.958
Julia, the number 64 bus driver.

10:48.041 --> 10:50.000
-Julia, the actress.
-[Jacopo scoffs]

10:50.750 --> 10:53.041
[Federica] There'll be
a lot of straight guys.

10:55.541 --> 10:58.041
Just in case anyone's actually interested.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.666
[Jacopo] Will you stop it?

11:00.583 --> 11:04.041
-Why are you swiping them? They're cute.
-[sighs] Not enough, really.

11:04.125 --> 11:07.083
There's way more dignity in being rejected
by someone out of my league.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.833
No. Now go and get ready.

11:08.916 --> 11:10.958
Put on something nice
and come out with us.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.250
Guys, as long as there's broadband,
there's hope.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.541
My sex appeal
is best expressed through a keyboard.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.666
You have to look truth in the eyes.

11:21.541 --> 11:22.666
However brutal.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.333
-[club music playing]
-So, me ankles, you shoulders?

11:25.416 --> 11:26.333
Right.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.875
No. No, no. No!

11:29.958 --> 11:31.208
Leave me, please! No!

11:31.291 --> 11:32.916
No, no!

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
[indistinct chatter]

11:43.833 --> 11:47.125
[sighs] Marta, we both have
something very important to tell you.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.083
Go on. I'm all ears.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.583
Oh God!

11:59.583 --> 12:02.916
Right, guys, about that thing
we need to discuss? Tell me later, okay?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
Now, excuse me. I'm going to work.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.791
[man 1] Do you like it?

12:10.625 --> 12:11.583
Thanks.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.500
Giacomo! How are you?

12:14.583 --> 12:17.125
-It's been ages. [giggles]
-[Giacomo] Marta.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.250
How are you doing?

12:18.333 --> 12:20.708
Bored stiff. This party's a drag.

12:20.791 --> 12:23.791
[sniffs] Everyone's so serious.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.375
I predict trouble ahead.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.750
Lots of trouble. [sighs]

12:27.833 --> 12:30.500
[man 2] Arturo! Arturo Selva!

12:31.250 --> 12:33.708
-Giacomo, nice seeing you again. Ciao.
-Same.

12:33.791 --> 12:36.041
-[man 2] Wherever you are, I'm there.
-[Federica] What?

12:36.125 --> 12:38.125
Why on earth
were you talking to Julia's brother?

12:38.208 --> 12:40.875
[sighs] He's been hitting on me for ages.
He's finally useful to me.

12:40.958 --> 12:43.041
-So?
-His name's Arturo Selva.

12:43.125 --> 12:46.875
We know he's handsome, he showers
in aftershave made by Tom Ford.

12:46.958 --> 12:48.333
Um…

12:49.125 --> 12:50.833
Oh, his profile is private.

12:50.916 --> 12:53.208
Sorry, can you hold this? Thank you.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.833
A few ideas. I'm confused.

12:54.916 --> 12:56.625
Not everyone's like you, buddy.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.916
You've had clear ideas
since nursery school.

12:59.416 --> 13:02.000
-If you say so.
-I was there too, remember?

13:02.583 --> 13:03.916
What's wrong with you?

13:04.416 --> 13:06.041
Nothing. Everything's great.

13:06.541 --> 13:07.625
As always.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.708
As always.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.166
[woman] There we go again.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.833
Wait, look!

13:12.916 --> 13:15.541
-He was tagged in a photo with Giacomo.
-Mo's photo.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.875
They're friends. [gasps]

13:18.375 --> 13:19.916
Break time's over.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.375
[sighs]

13:22.083 --> 13:23.541
I'm going back to work.

13:23.625 --> 13:27.666
[man 2] It's a cool place. It just opened.
I could take you there sometime.

13:28.666 --> 13:30.875
-How about we get another vodka?
-Where were you?

13:31.583 --> 13:33.500
-Yeah? What do you say?
-Hey. What are you doing?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
[phone unlocks]

13:46.083 --> 13:47.666
[typing]

13:50.208 --> 13:53.375
FORWARDED

13:53.458 --> 13:55.875
-[chuckles]
-Oh, oh, oh! I think I've lost my phone.

13:56.791 --> 13:57.625
Have you seen it?

13:57.708 --> 13:59.916
I don't know where it could've gone.
It's bright red.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.208
-No.
-I have no idea.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.541
-[phone clatters]
-[water splashes]

14:05.625 --> 14:06.833
[Marta sighs]

14:07.708 --> 14:08.666
[grunts]

14:10.250 --> 14:12.250
-[Marta sighs]
-[toilet flushes]

14:14.291 --> 14:16.833
[man 2] Impossible. He never sleeps.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.958
We've got everything. Let's bounce.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.333
[Jacopo grunts]

14:23.166 --> 14:24.541
[Federica] Wait for me!

14:24.625 --> 14:26.208
[club music fades]

14:26.291 --> 14:28.291
[tense music playing]

14:33.958 --> 14:35.791
[quirky music playing]

14:59.375 --> 15:00.208
Bingo!

15:02.958 --> 15:05.875
-Jacopo, you won't believe--
-[Jacopo panting, grunts]

15:06.958 --> 15:08.000
[Federica chuckles]

15:08.916 --> 15:12.625
[Marta gasping and panting]

15:12.708 --> 15:15.375
[nebuliser hissing]

15:15.458 --> 15:17.416
[Jacopo] We were…

15:17.500 --> 15:20.458
Uh, uh… What we were doing is, uh…

15:20.541 --> 15:22.041
Okay. Please, you tell her.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.458
You coward.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.166
We've decided to have a baby.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.791
But you're only 19.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.625
[sighs] Yes, but we feel we're ready.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.625
And… you decided to do it…

15:37.125 --> 15:39.125
-The old-school way.
-[Marta shudders]

15:39.208 --> 15:42.208
Which, um, it seems
is not going too--

15:42.291 --> 15:44.000
[groans] Spare me the particulars.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.333
Hear us out.

15:46.416 --> 15:48.833
We know lots of people
are going to react badly.

15:48.916 --> 15:50.375
Gonna say it runs against nature'--

15:50.458 --> 15:53.416
Well, what I saw
was most definitely against nature.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.166
[sighs] I mean,
why didn't you tell me anything?

15:57.666 --> 15:59.250
Fuck, we decide everything together.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.416
Even how many plies
the toilet paper should have.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.166
But something like this?

16:03.958 --> 16:05.750
You're right. Forgive us.

16:07.083 --> 16:07.958
Okay.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.833
[sighs] Can we think about it?

16:11.833 --> 16:15.958
And until I've decided what I think,
do you promise no more shenanigans?

16:17.333 --> 16:21.000
Uh, and anyway, we tried to tell you
last night at the party.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.250
All right.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.375
Jacopo.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.041
I know how you can earn my forgiveness.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.250
Get dressed. We're going somewhere.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.750
[both sigh, thud]

16:38.875 --> 16:41.041
ARMIDA ROWING CLUB
MEMBERS ONLY

16:41.125 --> 16:42.250
[birds singing]

16:42.333 --> 16:45.166
[Jacopo] Happy now? There's no one here.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.958
-Let's get some sleep.
-No, wait.

16:48.041 --> 16:51.041
Can't you feel how damp it is?
It's bad for me. What about you?

16:51.791 --> 16:53.875
[Marta gasps, grunts]

16:54.500 --> 16:56.500
[suspenseful music playing]

17:08.208 --> 17:10.000
-See? That's him!
-Shh!

17:10.083 --> 17:11.375
[Marta grunts softly]

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
[suspenseful music continues playing]

17:22.208 --> 17:23.416
[Marta, quietly] Hurry up.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.125
[woman] Good morning, Arturo.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.125
I'm sorry, it's members only.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.750
We are not holding trials right now.

17:32.833 --> 17:34.208
Apologies. We were just leaving.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.625
Sure. No, I understand. It's just that…

17:38.208 --> 17:40.625
Right, uh, do you know
what mucoviscidosis is?

17:41.125 --> 17:42.708
-[woman] No.
-[sad music playing]

17:43.375 --> 17:45.541
[Marta] Basically,
your lungs fill up with mucus

17:45.625 --> 17:49.083
until you get an infection,
then… it's all over.

17:50.041 --> 17:52.083
And you have muco…?

17:52.166 --> 17:54.791
[crying] Yes. I was diagnosed
when I was a child.

17:54.875 --> 17:56.333
Oh my. I'm sorry.

17:56.416 --> 17:59.500
I've made a bucket list
that I need to fulfil before the…

18:00.000 --> 18:01.500
the fateful time arrives.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.833
Oh, really? You do?
I also make lists of everything, you know?

18:04.916 --> 18:06.375
-[chuckles]
-Great, great, great.

18:06.458 --> 18:07.791
-So, then?
-[woman] Uh…

18:09.375 --> 18:11.500
[clears throat] You'd better come with me.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.125
-[Marta] Thank you, thank you.
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

18:14.208 --> 18:16.833
-[Marta coughs]
-You're evil incarnate.

18:16.916 --> 18:19.083
How dare you. I have muco.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.375
[woman] Our rowing club was founded
back in 1869.

18:22.458 --> 18:26.291
It immediately stood out for the cheerful
and carefree spirit of its members.

18:26.375 --> 18:30.041
Their happy antics
really have become the stuff of legend.

18:30.541 --> 18:35.916
On 25 February 1874,
the club was officially named Armida.

18:36.000 --> 18:36.958
[shutter clicks]

18:37.041 --> 18:39.208
The club is a great tradition.

18:39.291 --> 18:41.666
My grandmother was a secretary here.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.583
Then my mother. And now I'm here.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.291
[woman] Over the years,
the club has trained the finest athletes,

18:48.375 --> 18:51.916
including many world champions
and the odd Olympic one.

18:52.583 --> 18:55.583
One of the disciplines
the club shines in is pararowing

18:55.666 --> 18:58.500
for those athletes with disabilities.

18:58.583 --> 18:59.791
This is the training pool.

19:10.833 --> 19:14.125
-[showers running]

19:36.208 --> 19:37.208

[men chattering indistinctly]

19:52.166 --> 19:53.250
[Marta inhales]

19:56.958 --> 20:00.166
[Marta] Let's go!
I told you, I don't have much time left.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.500
[Jacopo] Hey.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.750
[bright music playing]

20:08.250 --> 20:10.333
-See you later.
-Yeah, okay.

20:17.541 --> 20:19.791
[speaking inaudibly]

20:22.875 --> 20:25.958
[ringtone playing]

20:26.750 --> 20:29.500
Hello, Federica?
I can't talk. I'm at university right now.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.958
[Federica] Ah, have you decided to study?

20:32.041 --> 20:35.750
[giggling] Yes. I am studying, actually.

20:35.833 --> 20:39.000
Good. Because on the 27th
you have a pedagogy exam.

20:39.083 --> 20:42.750
[chuckling] What? No, no, no, no.
I really don't think so.

20:42.833 --> 20:45.250
Yes, you do. I put you down for it.

20:45.333 --> 20:48.291
I'll let you go. You must be… very busy.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.125
You have no idea.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.625
[suspenseful music playing]

21:03.541 --> 21:05.958
[music building]

21:12.625 --> 21:14.625
[indistinct chatter]

21:45.875 --> 21:49.250
"Arturo Selva follows
his grandfather's footsteps."

21:49.833 --> 21:50.875
Ah.

21:52.958 --> 21:55.041
Marine engineering.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.375
[sighs] Full on, huh?

22:01.291 --> 22:03.416
[Marta laughs] Guys, I'm coming in.

22:03.916 --> 22:06.250
[Federica] Don't worry,
that was it for this month.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.666
I got my period.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.750
We'll try again in 18 and a half days.

22:09.833 --> 22:12.750
I still haven't decided
if I agree with this whole thing.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.708
-But I want to help you.
-With a gigantic enema?

22:18.500 --> 22:20.416
Have you guys not seen that film?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.666
There's this movie with Jennifer Aniston,

22:24.750 --> 22:27.916
and she wants to get pregnant
and uses a baster for turkeys.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.291
Do you really think this would work?

22:31.125 --> 22:34.041
-[mobile phone ringtone playing]
-[Marta giggles]

22:35.875 --> 22:38.416
-[ringtone stops playing]
-[Federica] Countess.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.250
What do you mean,
you've decided not to play on Thursday?

22:42.333 --> 22:44.125
[whispering] Stir the sauce for me?

22:44.208 --> 22:46.458
[in normal voice]
Of course, it's only down to luck.

22:47.708 --> 22:49.458
-Yes, of course, it's me.
-[Marta chuckles]

22:49.541 --> 22:51.666
Stop it. I'm begging you, please.

22:52.291 --> 22:54.375
[Federica] You'll see.
Your luck will change.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.750
[sighs] Why now, exactly?

23:02.541 --> 23:04.583
Give me three good reasons,
and I promise I'll stop.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.833
Bollocks to your lists.
I feel like I'm ready.

23:06.916 --> 23:09.125
Hmm. That's Federica's reason.

23:09.208 --> 23:12.458
But I'll let it pass. Next?

23:13.666 --> 23:15.958
Because I want to make a difference
for someone.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.833
You already do that for me.

23:19.791 --> 23:21.166
You'll be the best aunt ever.

23:21.250 --> 23:24.541
And you're always the first
to get broody over kids, right?

23:24.625 --> 23:25.958
[Marta chuckles softly]

23:27.458 --> 23:28.708
You guys are doing it for me.

23:28.791 --> 23:29.833
Listen up, darling.

23:29.916 --> 23:32.833
Just because you're on your way out,
it doesn't mean everything's about you.

23:35.750 --> 23:39.208
Maybe… the muco sped things up a little,

23:39.291 --> 23:43.500
but if you start thinking about it,
there'll never be a right moment.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.833
Come on, cheer up! The family's growing!

23:47.916 --> 23:53.291
[chuckles] Luckily, you guys still have
18 and a half days to think about it.

23:53.375 --> 23:55.333
[bright music playing]

23:55.416 --> 23:58.125
That crazy countess
kicked me off their Thursday poker game

23:58.208 --> 24:00.666
because she says
I always leave them high and dry.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.708
-The richer they are, the stingier.
-[Marta and Jacopo chuckle]

24:04.291 --> 24:05.375
Have I missed something?

24:05.458 --> 24:07.541
[Marta laughing]

24:07.625 --> 24:10.458
-[Federica] The sauce!
-[sauce sizzling]

24:10.541 --> 24:13.458
[Marta and Jacopo continue laughing]

24:13.541 --> 24:17.208
What are you laughing about?
I'm not eating tuna three nights in a row.

24:17.291 --> 24:20.000
-[scoffs] No!
-[Marta and Jacopo laughing hysterically]

24:20.083 --> 24:23.208
[bright music continues playing]

24:25.833 --> 24:27.833
[group panting]

24:29.250 --> 24:31.625
[Marta] Guys, I'm dying!

24:31.708 --> 24:34.416
-We haven't even done 200 meters.
-But I have muco!

24:34.500 --> 24:36.083
Exactly. You heard the doctor.

24:36.166 --> 24:37.541
-You need to walk.
-[Marta coughing]

24:37.625 --> 24:38.583
[sighs]

24:39.541 --> 24:42.208
-So, how's the stalking going?
-Not great.

24:42.291 --> 24:46.125
I can't figure him out.
He seems to hate everything he does.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.125
He's got the Instagram profile
of an idiot.

24:48.208 --> 24:51.375
His followers are a bunch of morons
who all pretend to be his best friend.

24:51.458 --> 24:54.500
He rows like his dad and studies
marine engineering like his grandpa.

24:54.583 --> 24:55.958
-[Jacopo grunts]
-Doesn't eat carbs.

24:56.041 --> 24:59.416
All that's missing is he likes karaoke.
It's all so bloody boring.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.625
If I bore you so much,
why do you follow me everywhere?

25:09.375 --> 25:13.250
Oh. So, you… notice me. [chuckles]

25:13.333 --> 25:15.750
Mm-hmm. What do you want?

25:20.666 --> 25:21.833
A dinner date!

25:24.416 --> 25:27.250
-What?
-[Marta] Well, you asked me what I want.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.458
A real date.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.208
And if we don't click,
I promise I'll leave you alone.

25:39.000 --> 25:39.833
Let's do it.

25:40.416 --> 25:44.125
See you at my place at eight.
You already know the address, right?

25:45.416 --> 25:48.791
Just… in case, should we maybe take down
each other's numbers?

25:48.875 --> 25:49.875
No.

25:51.333 --> 25:53.666
I normally do a good deed
at least once a year.

25:53.750 --> 25:57.333
I would guess with this,
I should be fine for quite a long time.

25:59.541 --> 26:01.041
What an arsehole.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.833
Shh!

26:03.625 --> 26:06.041
I have a dinner date with Arturo Selva!

26:06.125 --> 26:09.458
-[giggles, sighs]
-[bright music playing]

26:10.583 --> 26:14.625
-[Ahmed] Good morning, little Marta.
-[Marta] Good morning to you, big Ahmed.

26:23.291 --> 26:24.208
[door opens]

26:27.333 --> 26:30.791
[Marta sighs] I don't need these any more.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.458
-[exhales]
-[door opens]

26:34.333 --> 26:36.916
Marta, these are today's offers for you.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.333
Are you okay?

26:38.416 --> 26:41.083
Director, I've never been better.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.583
You worry too much.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.041
You should be an actor, you know that?

26:46.125 --> 26:49.250
With that smile… Has anyone ever told you?

26:49.333 --> 26:52.541
[director grumbles] Eh?

26:58.375 --> 26:59.291
[switch clicks]

27:01.916 --> 27:03.625
Dear customers…

27:03.708 --> 27:04.708
[sighs, seductively]

27:04.791 --> 27:08.750
…if you feel like cooking
an intimate dinner for the one you love,

27:08.833 --> 27:12.541
why not start with a nice appetizer?

27:13.041 --> 27:17.541
Today only,
wild salmon on offer at 50 cents.

27:17.625 --> 27:20.458
While stocks last, naturally.

27:20.541 --> 27:21.708
You can then continue

27:21.791 --> 27:24.583
and spoil the love of your life

27:24.666 --> 27:28.000
with an Italian succulent
whole-roasted chicken,

27:28.083 --> 27:31.000
which, for you, is only 30 cents.

27:31.083 --> 27:35.000
And why not wash it all down
with some sparkling wine?

27:35.500 --> 27:37.458

42:04.458 --> 42:06.166
Those are the calories right there.

42:06.666 --> 42:10.375
[chuckles] You never get when I'm joking.

-[waiter] Good evening.
-Good evening.

42:15.541 --> 42:17.833
[waiter] May I suggest a seitan cutlet,

42:17.916 --> 42:21.166
soaked in apple cider vinegar
and tofu mousse with parsley

42:21.250 --> 42:23.291
from our bioclimatic greenhouse?

42:24.625 --> 42:25.666
Yes.

42:25.750 --> 42:29.750
And could you also bring us
a bottle of Franciacorta? Thank you.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.083
Everyone's looking at us.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.208
I'm used to it.

42:41.666 --> 42:42.875
Tell me about it.

42:51.875 --> 42:53.041
[exhales]

42:53.666 --> 42:54.958
Okay.

42:55.041 --> 42:56.416
[humming]

42:56.500 --> 42:59.083
[smacks lips] Let's play a game, okay?

43:01.208 --> 43:05.000
Right. We have five questions each,
and there is only one rule, okay?

43:05.083 --> 43:06.250
We cannot lie.

43:06.916 --> 43:11.750
But we can play a get-out-of-jail card
in case the question is too personal.

43:13.500 --> 43:14.375
I'm in.

43:15.791 --> 43:18.125
Describe yourself in three adjectives.

43:18.208 --> 43:19.625
Not all positive.

43:23.458 --> 43:24.583
Generous.

43:25.541 --> 43:26.875
Hmm.

43:26.958 --> 43:28.166
Impatient.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.541
Wary.

43:32.333 --> 43:33.375
Okay.

43:34.625 --> 43:35.458
Your turn now.

43:36.416 --> 43:37.500
Why me, exactly?

43:37.583 --> 43:38.750
Why? [giggling]

43:38.833 --> 43:40.083
Because you're handsome.

43:42.375 --> 43:44.041
What do you hate most in other people?

43:45.708 --> 43:47.041
Superficiality.

43:48.750 --> 43:51.666
[Marta takes a deep breath, exhales]

43:52.250 --> 43:54.625
[takes a deep breath]
Your turn. Make a wish.

43:56.416 --> 44:00.833
I wish my parents could still be alive.
I practically never knew them, you know?

44:03.416 --> 44:06.208
Gosh, so heavy. I'll change my wish.

44:06.291 --> 44:07.291
I wish…

44:08.333 --> 44:10.166
[quietly] …I could have a pork sandwich.

44:13.208 --> 44:15.208
[quirky music playing]

44:18.041 --> 44:20.500
Ahmed! Thank you,
thank you, thank you! [laughs]

44:20.583 --> 44:23.291
Now, but don't you two
get me fired, right?

44:29.791 --> 44:31.708
Well then, what's the plan?

44:33.583 --> 44:34.625
[lights click on]

44:48.625 --> 44:49.500
[switch clicks]

44:49.583 --> 44:50.791
[sultry music playing]

44:50.875 --> 44:53.708
[seductively] Good evening, Master Arturo.

44:53.791 --> 44:56.375
[over PA] And welcome to Chez Marta.

44:57.250 --> 44:59.750
All dishes are locally sourced,

44:59.833 --> 45:01.666
in the sense that you get them yourself.

45:02.916 --> 45:04.541
For the first course,

45:04.625 --> 45:07.833
the chef offers you a timeless classic
of Italian cuisine,

45:08.500 --> 45:09.833
la pizza margherita,

45:09.916 --> 45:11.833
in aisle ten.

45:16.750 --> 45:17.833
For the main course,

45:17.916 --> 45:21.000
one slight deviation
from the long-held vegan tradition,

45:21.083 --> 45:24.458
platter of cold cuts, aisle nine.

45:25.458 --> 45:28.166
Accompanied by a selection of cheeses.

45:29.041 --> 45:30.041
Aisle three.

45:30.916 --> 45:32.250
And for dessert,

45:32.333 --> 45:34.125
a real delicacy,

45:34.208 --> 45:37.166
strawberries, down aisle five.

45:38.625 --> 45:41.208
All washed down with…

45:42.666 --> 45:44.875
[panting] The wine is my call.

45:46.125 --> 45:48.000
I'll see you in the garden department.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.708

46:02.291 --> 46:03.125
[Arturo] Let's see.

46:10.541 --> 46:11.375
Good.

46:12.291 --> 46:14.208
I'm playing on my home turf, dear.

46:14.291 --> 46:16.791
-[Arturo] Mm.
-[laughs] Speaking of playing…

46:17.750 --> 46:18.583
Shoot.

46:19.250 --> 46:20.958
How many times have you said I love you?

46:21.750 --> 46:24.125
-Never.
-Are you being serious?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.291
Not even to Elena,

46:26.375 --> 46:29.916
the blonde you were with
from 2017 till August 2018?

46:31.166 --> 46:33.291
What did you expect? I'm a real pro.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.166
No. Not even to Elena.

46:36.250 --> 46:39.041
Which is why, in the summer of 2018,

46:39.625 --> 46:40.458
she dumped me.

46:41.041 --> 46:42.750
-[Marta inhales sharply]
-[Arturo] My turn.

46:43.250 --> 46:44.958
How do you see yourself at 60?

46:46.541 --> 46:48.541
[gentle music playing]

46:48.625 --> 46:51.333
[chuckles softly, sighs]
Oh my goodness, how stressful.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.083
At 60, eh?

46:54.458 --> 46:56.875
[sighs] Okay. Um…

46:58.458 --> 47:03.000
I see myself happily married
to an English writer.

47:04.333 --> 47:07.083
Just think, he asked me to marry him
on a gondola ride.

47:08.458 --> 47:10.916
Super cheesy, I know,
but that's how he is.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.416
[chuckles] We live in Cornwall,
and we have three children, to be precise.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.458
Two boys and a girl
because we love children.

47:18.958 --> 47:23.208
But they're at college now,
so at 60 years of age,

47:24.208 --> 47:25.625
my husband and I,

47:27.333 --> 47:31.416
we finally have some time
to dedicate to ourselves.

47:32.750 --> 47:34.750
It seems you've planned everything.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.708
My turn.
Don't you like planning things ever?

47:43.250 --> 47:45.916
[Arturo] I don't know.
I've never done any.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.208
I always let other people tell me…
what I should and shouldn't like.

47:52.541 --> 47:55.833
My family… my friends.

47:58.791 --> 48:01.500
Okay, and here's my fourth question.

48:02.208 --> 48:03.416
Are you a virgin?

48:05.375 --> 48:06.208
Well?

48:06.291 --> 48:07.500
[takes a deep breath]

48:07.583 --> 48:11.583
I'm not actually a Virgo.
Mm, July, so I'm a Cancer.

48:11.666 --> 48:13.791
[chuckles] No, that's not fair.

48:13.875 --> 48:17.458
Well, you should have been more specific.
I must have misheard. [chuckles]

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
[soothing instrumental music playing]

48:30.291 --> 48:31.791
Thank you for this evening.

48:32.750 --> 48:34.291
-[chuckles]
-No, thank you.

48:37.125 --> 48:38.916
-There's still--
-The last question, I know.

48:39.416 --> 48:40.583
The last question.

48:42.916 --> 48:44.125
I would like to know the truth.

48:44.208 --> 48:46.166
Am I the ugliest girl
you've ever gone out with?

48:50.041 --> 48:50.875
No.

48:52.250 --> 48:55.458
-[tense music playing]
-You played your get-out-of-jail card.

49:04.416 --> 49:05.416
Was it

49:06.666 --> 49:08.041
what you expected?

49:10.041 --> 49:12.625
-Better. [chuckling]
-Oh.

49:22.583 --> 49:23.750
Good night.

49:23.833 --> 49:25.833
[bright piano music playing]

49:27.291 --> 49:28.166
[Arturo] Oh God.

49:28.250 --> 49:29.833
-[both chuckle]
-Sorry.

49:31.250 --> 49:32.750
-Do you want to come up, then?
-Yes.

49:32.833 --> 49:33.708
What?

49:44.041 --> 49:45.041
[Marta grunts] Oh.

49:45.125 --> 49:47.333
[chuckles nervously]

49:47.416 --> 49:49.541

Uh, do you want something to drink?

50:17.875 --> 50:19.291
Uh, to eat?

50:21.958 --> 50:24.500
Sorry, it's my room-mate.

50:24.583 --> 50:27.125
He has a sinus issue.
Poor thing. [chuckles]

Shall we watch a film?

50:38.125 --> 50:38.958
No.

50:49.583 --> 50:52.166
Are you sure? I mean,
it's not like we've signed a contract.

50:52.250 --> 50:54.583
You're not obliged to--

It's just that it's getting late.
I have class.

1:12:09.625 --> 1:12:11.833
[club music playing]

1:12:11.916 --> 1:12:13.916
[excited chatter]

1:12:21.750 --> 1:12:24.291
Dude, how are you doing?
Wait, wait, let me guess.

1:12:24.375 --> 1:12:25.750
Everything is great. [laughs]

1:12:25.833 --> 1:12:27.208
This is dope. Look.

1:12:27.958 --> 1:12:30.083
Stop it. Okay? It's not funny.

1:12:31.250 --> 1:12:32.166
Hey, Gia.

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:39.166
Hey, you.

1:12:40.125 --> 1:12:41.833
What's that face for?

1:12:41.916 --> 1:12:43.333
Come on. Come here.

1:12:43.916 --> 1:12:45.041
Come over here, then.

1:13:01.416 --> 1:13:03.041
[music fades]

1:13:06.250 --> 1:13:08.625
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, Bea.

1:13:08.708 --> 1:13:10.750
I don't feel like it.
I don't feel like it.

1:13:10.833 --> 1:13:13.583
-What? Come on, relax.
-No.

1:13:14.083 --> 1:13:14.958
[grunts]

1:13:15.541 --> 1:13:19.458
Look, I'd be doing it
just to get back at someone,

1:13:19.541 --> 1:13:21.750
and that's not fair on either of you.

1:13:21.833 --> 1:13:23.125
Look, it's cool with me.

1:13:23.708 --> 1:13:25.000
Well, not with me.

1:13:28.541 --> 1:13:30.708
[door opens, closes]

1:13:31.833 --> 1:13:33.833
[birds singing]

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:50.833
[mother] Arturo,
your father and I are very concerned, uh,

1:13:50.916 --> 1:13:52.125
about you and that girl.

1:13:52.208 --> 1:13:53.583
What's her name again?

1:13:53.666 --> 1:13:54.708
Marta, Mum.

1:13:55.666 --> 1:13:59.000
Her name is Marta,
and you don't have to worry any more.

1:14:00.208 --> 1:14:01.125
It's over.

1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:03.833
Oh, thank goodness.

1:14:04.625 --> 1:14:07.666
It was so very cruel of you
to lead her on in that way.

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000
-She left me.
-[mother laughs]

1:14:11.083 --> 1:14:14.291
I don't think that someone like her
would miss an opportunity like this one.

1:14:15.625 --> 1:14:16.958
It might come as a shock to you,

1:14:17.041 --> 1:14:19.416
but not everyone craves
to be part of this family.

1:14:21.833 --> 1:14:24.666
Do you mean the family
that sent you to the best university?

1:14:25.250 --> 1:14:26.250
That bought you a horse

1:14:26.333 --> 1:14:28.000
and pays for membership
to the rowing club?

1:14:28.083 --> 1:14:30.875
Are you referring to that family, huh?

1:14:30.958 --> 1:14:32.583
All things I didn't choose.

1:14:36.833 --> 1:14:37.875
[mother sighs]

1:14:41.416 --> 1:14:42.833
Let me tell you a story.

1:14:42.916 --> 1:14:44.916
[sombre piano music playing]

1:14:45.833 --> 1:14:47.666
When I first met your father,

1:14:48.875 --> 1:14:50.541
your grandfather disapproved.

1:14:51.708 --> 1:14:53.666
Your grandfather could be tough.

1:14:54.250 --> 1:14:55.250
Very tough.

1:14:57.041 --> 1:15:02.166
He made me sit in this very room
and ordered me to leave your father.

1:15:03.541 --> 1:15:04.666
I stood up to him,

1:15:05.750 --> 1:15:07.791
and at 19, he kicked me out of the house

1:15:08.541 --> 1:15:09.708
without anything.

1:15:10.916 --> 1:15:13.750
And then, when Filippo graduated

1:15:13.833 --> 1:15:15.625
and found a job,

1:15:15.708 --> 1:15:16.958
we got married.

1:15:18.833 --> 1:15:21.250
A ceremony that was simple but beautiful.

1:15:21.333 --> 1:15:23.125
To which Grandpa

1:15:24.708 --> 1:15:26.666
wasn't invited, I suppose?

1:15:26.750 --> 1:15:29.583
Not… Not only did I invite him,

1:15:30.666 --> 1:15:33.500
but… but I hoped
until the very last minute

1:15:33.583 --> 1:15:35.958
that he would be there
to walk me down the aisle.

1:15:38.125 --> 1:15:39.250
He never replied.

1:15:41.416 --> 1:15:42.500
One day,

1:15:43.166 --> 1:15:44.416
the telephone rang, and

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:46.916
it was a notary.

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.416
My dad had passed away.

1:15:49.208 --> 1:15:51.291
And, along with his will,
there was a short letter,

1:15:51.375 --> 1:15:52.750
just a couple of lines.

1:15:54.083 --> 1:15:55.583
He was there at the wedding.

1:15:57.541 --> 1:16:00.333
He was too proud
to let himself be seen, but…

1:16:03.125 --> 1:16:04.000
he was there.

1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:09.458
[sighs]

1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:12.583
Arturo,

1:16:13.583 --> 1:16:15.541
we will always have a choice.

1:16:16.416 --> 1:16:17.291
Always.

1:16:21.916 --> 1:16:23.916
[indistinct chatter]

1:16:31.791 --> 1:16:35.125
-Two thousand three hundred views.
-Forget about the video.

1:16:35.208 --> 1:16:37.416
You have more important things
to think about.

1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:38.458
[crow cawing]

1:16:38.541 --> 1:16:41.083
-I'll kill that Selva.
-Guys, I'm fine.

1:16:41.791 --> 1:16:42.958
It was abnormal.

1:16:43.541 --> 1:16:46.000
Now things have returned
to their natural order.

1:16:49.625 --> 1:16:50.541
Papa?

1:16:52.083 --> 1:16:54.125
That's the pneumology ward, isn't it?

1:16:55.083 --> 1:16:56.125
[Marcello] Mm-hmm.

1:16:58.083 --> 1:17:00.083
[bells ringing]

1:17:03.208 --> 1:17:04.708
[both] Oh, fuck.

1:17:14.625 --> 1:17:16.958
No. Don't take it off.

1:17:20.791 --> 1:17:23.791
What do you want?
You've already won. What more do you want?

1:17:24.958 --> 1:17:26.458
I'd just like to talk a minute.

1:17:27.875 --> 1:17:28.875
[Marta sighs]

1:17:45.041 --> 1:17:46.791
-I'm so sorry.
-About what?

1:17:48.333 --> 1:17:51.083
-Everything.
-That's a lot of stuff, you know.

1:17:52.833 --> 1:17:54.458
I'm especially sorry that you're sick.

1:17:55.166 --> 1:17:56.458
[scoffs] Nice.

1:17:56.958 --> 1:17:59.833
-I imagine you've already told everyone.
-No, it's not up to me.

1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:01.791
But you have to tell Arturo.

1:18:04.791 --> 1:18:06.458
Marta, he really is in love with you.

1:18:07.041 --> 1:18:09.416
[scoffs] That video really showed
all the love he has for me.

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:13.541
Paradoxically, that video
is the proof that he loves you.

1:18:14.041 --> 1:18:15.208
I was the one that kissed him.

1:18:16.041 --> 1:18:19.500
And when I tried to get him into bed,
he said no.

1:18:21.416 --> 1:18:23.291
He said no? To you?

1:18:23.375 --> 1:18:24.583
[clicks tongue] Yeah.

1:18:25.166 --> 1:18:26.916
[chuckles] He must be crazy.

1:18:28.041 --> 1:18:29.583
This isn't the first time for me.

1:18:31.166 --> 1:18:34.208
Girls like you might struggle
to find a boyfriend.

1:18:34.291 --> 1:18:36.500
Girls like me struggle to keep one.

1:18:37.833 --> 1:18:40.958
Actually, saying "girls like you"
isn't very nice, you know.

1:18:42.166 --> 1:18:44.166
Even if it is very realistic.

1:18:44.916 --> 1:18:47.208
But please don't say
that we're in the same boat.

1:18:47.291 --> 1:18:48.791
No, we're definitely not.

1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:50.625
You have Arturo,

1:18:52.416 --> 1:18:53.291
and I don't.

1:18:57.666 --> 1:18:59.333
Hey, Beatrice?

1:19:01.833 --> 1:19:04.125
You're the most beautiful loser
I've ever known.

1:19:05.416 --> 1:19:06.958
[chuckles]

1:19:08.458 --> 1:19:10.583
You've really left her alone
with that bitch?

1:19:10.666 --> 1:19:13.416
Believe me.
I'm more concerned for the bitch. [laughs]

1:19:15.458 --> 1:19:16.958
Actually, while we're here.

1:19:17.458 --> 1:19:19.291
We seem to be alone in the house.

1:19:22.333 --> 1:19:23.416
Have you changed your mind?

1:19:25.708 --> 1:19:27.500
Me? No. You?

1:19:27.583 --> 1:19:29.541
Me, no. You?

1:19:32.208 --> 1:19:34.583
Maybe I have a couple of doubts.
There, I said it.

1:19:34.666 --> 1:19:37.416
[sighs] I knew it. Spill, then.

1:19:39.916 --> 1:19:40.791
Okay.

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.333
When we fall in love with someone
and stop living together…

1:19:46.416 --> 1:19:47.666
-[Federica] Mm.
-[Jacopo] Mm.

1:19:48.208 --> 1:19:50.416
-Who will the baby stay with?
-With the both of us.

1:19:51.583 --> 1:19:53.666
My parents got divorced when I was 13.

1:19:53.750 --> 1:19:57.166
And believe me,
I never had any problems having two houses

1:19:57.250 --> 1:19:58.458
and being a princess in both.

1:19:58.541 --> 1:19:59.750
What if we fall out?

1:19:59.833 --> 1:20:03.375
Oh, couples fight over money and cheating.
It doesn't affect us.

1:20:03.875 --> 1:20:06.125
-Okay. Okay.
-[Federica sighs]

1:20:06.208 --> 1:20:09.833
The child will have loving,
wealthy parents who never fight.

1:20:11.125 --> 1:20:14.500
-And will he live a happy life?
-Disgustingly so.

1:20:16.833 --> 1:20:20.541
Well, let's say he or she… is fine.

1:20:23.916 --> 1:20:24.916
But what about us?

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:34.083
[closes laptop]

1:20:37.916 --> 1:20:42.166
Listen, I ovulate every 28 days
for at least another 30 years.

1:20:42.250 --> 1:20:43.416
[bright music playing]

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:45.375
I'd say we have time.

1:20:46.750 --> 1:20:50.166
-But we'll definitely do it.
-Of course we'll do it.

1:20:52.791 --> 1:20:54.083
[Jacopo groans softly]

1:20:59.708 --> 1:21:01.541
[sighs] Keep the change.

1:21:02.041 --> 1:21:04.250
[takes a deep breath]
Wish me luck, will you?

1:21:08.625 --> 1:21:10.875
[secretary] Miss? Miss, wait!
Where are you going?

1:21:10.958 --> 1:21:13.208
I have one more thing to do before I die.

1:21:14.458 --> 1:21:16.458
[showers running]

1:21:27.250 --> 1:21:29.875
-[Marta] Um, Arturo Selva?
-[man] There.

1:21:34.625 --> 1:21:35.625
[Marta exhales]

1:21:49.041 --> 1:21:50.041
FORGIVE ME

1:21:59.875 --> 1:22:00.708
[paper rips]

1:22:00.791 --> 1:22:02.666
PLEASE

1:22:12.875 --> 1:22:13.791
[paper rips]

1:22:13.875 --> 1:22:15.625
I LOVE YOU!

1:22:23.166 --> 1:22:26.208
Look, I understand that you're mad at me
and you never want to see me again,

1:22:26.291 --> 1:22:29.500
and you're absolutely right
because I was stupid, I was immature and--

1:22:29.583 --> 1:22:31.583
[bright orchestral music playing]

1:22:40.125 --> 1:22:41.791
I have to tell you something.

1:22:44.083 --> 1:22:46.541
[takes a deep breath] And there's no cure?

1:22:48.500 --> 1:22:49.458
No.

1:22:52.166 --> 1:22:55.500
There are some therapies
that help to keep the infections at bay.

1:22:56.208 --> 1:22:57.958
But they do not work for me.

1:22:59.416 --> 1:23:00.750
Why didn't you tell me?

1:23:02.958 --> 1:23:06.125
Firstly, because it's not exactly
the most romantic thing

1:23:06.208 --> 1:23:07.833
to say on a first date.

1:23:07.916 --> 1:23:10.625
"Hey, I'm Marta,
and I live in a bubble of mucus."

1:23:10.708 --> 1:23:12.083
-[chuckles softly]
-[Arturo sighs]

1:23:15.708 --> 1:23:16.958
And then, because…

1:23:19.250 --> 1:23:22.791
I didn't want you to feel obliged
to be with me just because I'm not well.

1:23:22.875 --> 1:23:24.166
[sombre music playing]

1:23:24.250 --> 1:23:25.958
Because you decide everything, right?

1:23:26.916 --> 1:23:29.750
I'm just trying
to make it easier for you, if possible.

1:23:36.916 --> 1:23:40.250
The doctor just told me
my situation is degenerating quickly.

1:23:43.541 --> 1:23:45.916
I could go
precisely when we're at our best.

1:23:54.541 --> 1:23:55.708
Okay.

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.083
And I could fall in love
with someone else,

1:23:59.833 --> 1:24:00.666
and you,

1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:04.583
you could betray me with Giacomo.

1:24:06.458 --> 1:24:08.500
That's what relationships are, Marta.

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.250
Sometimes they make you feel shitty.
Sometimes they make you feel great.

1:24:12.333 --> 1:24:14.875
Regardless of whether
you're healthy or sick.

1:24:18.166 --> 1:24:20.750
I'll kill you
if you fall in love with someone else.

1:24:20.833 --> 1:24:22.916
And I'll kill you
if you betray me with Giacomo.

1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.875
[laughs] I'd kill myself in that case.

1:24:24.958 --> 1:24:26.958
[bright instrumental music playing]

1:24:51.416 --> 1:24:55.333
[doorbell buzzing]

1:25:01.708 --> 1:25:03.541
[doorbell continues buzzing]

1:25:09.458 --> 1:25:10.916
[Arturo panting]

1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:14.500
-Hey. Are you mad, or--
-I have good news. Let me in.

1:25:14.583 --> 1:25:16.083
Shh, you'll wake everyone up.

1:25:16.833 --> 1:25:20.958
Right. I did some research.
Uh, apparently, there is a cure.

1:25:21.041 --> 1:25:23.291
Or rather, there will be one soon.

1:25:24.041 --> 1:25:25.083
It's experimental.

1:25:25.166 --> 1:25:27.166
So, Dr. Fahim,

1:25:27.250 --> 1:25:29.791
at the last international congress
on pneumology,

1:25:29.875 --> 1:25:32.541
produced some extraordinary test results.

1:25:32.625 --> 1:25:34.416
Through the combined use of three drugs,

1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:37.333
you can target directly
the faulty proteins.

1:25:37.416 --> 1:25:40.750
With this therapy,
the patients' overall survival statistics

1:25:41.250 --> 1:25:43.291
rise up to 19%.

1:25:44.625 --> 1:25:46.250
Nineteen percent, you say?

1:25:46.333 --> 1:25:48.458
Nineteen percent.

1:25:49.750 --> 1:25:51.000
That's at least double the odds

1:25:51.083 --> 1:25:53.500
of someone like me
landing a catch like you, eh?

1:25:53.583 --> 1:25:54.833
[both chuckle]

1:25:57.791 --> 1:25:59.375
I love you so much, you know?

1:26:00.416 --> 1:26:01.583
Now I know, yeah.

1:26:11.208 --> 1:26:14.500
Besides… landing a catch like me,

1:26:15.708 --> 1:26:18.541
do you have any other compulsions
that we can satisfy?
