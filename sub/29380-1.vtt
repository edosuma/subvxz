00:01.135 --> 00:03.969
(dramatic music)

00:18.152 --> 00:20.652
(somber music)

00:20.654 --> 00:23.322
(rain falling)

00:32.967 --> 00:36.769
(airplanes droning)

00:36.771 --> 00:39.671
(thunder booming)

01:45.172 --> 01:47.406
(sobbing)

01:55.516 --> 01:56.815
- Oh, Patricia.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.121
(crying)

02:08.562 --> 02:12.297
(gentle instrumental music)

02:16.804 --> 02:19.638
(birds chirping)

02:30.584 --> 02:32.384
- [Announcer] June
sixth, American, British

02:32.386 --> 02:34.686
and Canadian forces
landed at Normandy.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.022
We count today as victorious.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.691
Northern France
has been liberated.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.027
Our prayers go out to the
soldiers which lost their lives

02:42.029 --> 02:45.063
fighting to save our future.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.965
To continue the good
news, mark your calendars

02:46.967 --> 02:49.334
September third, look
to the sky at seven P.M.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.570
To see the lunar eclipse, a
sight that won't be seen again

02:51.572 --> 02:53.105
for another 10 to 15 years.

02:53.107 --> 02:54.907
But remember to stay safe

02:54.909 --> 02:57.876
and adhere to blackout
regulations.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.052
- Mrs. Baylock?

03:07.054 --> 03:11.023
Would you like me to make
you something to eat?

03:12.426 --> 03:13.692
Mrs. Baylock?

03:17.231 --> 03:18.297
- [Susanna] Annabel?

03:19.767 --> 03:21.833
- Mrs. Baylock?

03:21.835 --> 03:26.038
Are you all right?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.440
Mrs. Baylock, where are you?

03:33.447 --> 03:34.613
Mrs. Baylock!

03:45.492 --> 03:47.059
Mrs. Baylock?

03:47.061 --> 03:49.895
I've done most of the laundry.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.431
I'll do the rest later
once the storm's passed.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.200
- [Susanna] Annabel!

03:56.804 --> 03:58.203
- Where are you?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.406
Mrs. Baylock!

04:01.408 --> 04:04.977
(air raid sirens blaring)

04:09.516 --> 04:12.584
(explosion booming)

04:17.024 --> 04:19.858
(planes roaring)

04:30.838 --> 04:33.472
(somber music)

04:36.076 --> 04:37.242
- Hello.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.044
Would you mind if I sit here?

04:39.046 --> 04:40.279
- Why, I'm not scared.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.914
- Oh, no, didn't think
you were scared.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.450
Big, brave boy like you.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.353
But the truth is,
I'm very scared.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.589
I could hold your
hand if you like.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.757
- No, I don't want to.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.992
- That's fine.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.030
(explosions booming)

05:01.535 --> 05:02.734
It's all right, it's okay.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.069
Don't worry.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.570
So, where's your mother?

05:05.572 --> 05:07.139
- She's at home.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.309
She's sick and she sent
me to get some food.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.177
- Well do you live close by?

05:12.179 --> 05:13.078
- Yes.

05:14.048 --> 05:15.514
- When we get the all clear,

05:15.516 --> 05:17.115
I can take you home if you like.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.251
- No, that's all right.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.152
- Okay.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.622
(explosion booming)

05:23.624 --> 05:24.956
It's all right.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.799
(airplanes droning)

05:37.304 --> 05:42.374
- Are you going on holiday?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.543
- No.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.477
I've got this.

05:47.047 --> 05:47.946
It's a letter.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.484
It said that my sister died so
I've got to go to her house.

05:52.486 --> 05:55.487
- My sister died
when she was born.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.861
(airplanes droning)

06:02.863 --> 06:06.431
(air raid sirens blaring)

06:10.571 --> 06:11.737
- Wait, wait!

06:14.675 --> 06:17.309
(somber music)

06:59.686 --> 07:02.320
(rain falling)

07:29.183 --> 07:30.215
- Hello?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.750
- Oh, hello.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.654
I'm Patricia Woodhouse, I'm
just here about my sister,

07:35.656 --> 07:36.755
Susanna Baylock.

07:36.757 --> 07:37.989
- Oh, of course.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.491
I'm Annabel Blair.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.126
I was your sister's help.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.594
Please, let me take
that from you.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.996
- Oh, no, no,
it's fine, I can manage.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.998
- Please come through.
- Thank you.

07:50.304 --> 07:54.506
- Please.
- Oh, thank you.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.442
Oh, I noticed some
broken windows.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.679
- Yes, about a week ago a
bomb fell a few streets over,

08:00.681 --> 08:03.648
it was felt rather
strongly here.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.318
A few broken windows
but no serious damage.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.787
Although I can't say the
same for Dove Street.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.589
- Was anyone seriously injured?

08:10.591 --> 08:12.457
- Not that I'm aware of.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.259
Few cuts and bruises but

08:15.262 --> 08:17.562
the houses suffered major
damage.

08:21.468 --> 08:25.237
- Can I ask what exactly
happened to Susanna?

08:29.810 --> 08:30.926
- Well...

08:30.927 --> 08:32.043
I'd come downstairs
to do the laundry.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.679
When I returned upstairs,
I couldn't find her.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.683
It was the strangest thing,

08:39.686 --> 08:43.255
I could've sworn I heard her
call my name just before I...

08:44.858 --> 08:45.757
Before,

08:49.396 --> 08:50.662
before I found her.

08:50.663 --> 08:51.929
She was laying at the foot
of the stairs and her,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.267
she must've fallen.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.569
My condolences, Mrs.
Woodhouse, it was awful.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.105
I still can't quite believe it.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.775
- I hadn't seen her in so long.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.012
- I'm truly sorry to hear that.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.616
After your sister's
death, the relevant papers

09:11.618 --> 09:14.219
were put in order and, well,

09:14.221 --> 09:17.155
she left something
rather important to you.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.823
- And what's that?

09:18.825 --> 09:19.724
- The house.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.227
- Why?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.429
- You're her only living
relative.

09:24.431 --> 09:27.065
Mr. and Mrs. Baylock
never did have children,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.367
she bequeathed the house to you.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.369
- But this is Victor's
house, what about Victor,

09:31.371 --> 09:32.604
where is he?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.472
- No one knows.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.974
- He's missing?

09:35.976 --> 09:38.109
- And has been for some time.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.447
Mr. and Mrs. Baylock
retired early one evening.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.483
I finished the cleaning,
went up myself.

09:45.485 --> 09:49.521
The next morning I rose early,
made breakfast as usual,

09:49.523 --> 09:52.724
but when I took it up to
them, Mr. Baylock was gone.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.125
That was two years ago.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.329
- And no letter?

09:57.331 --> 09:58.163
- Nothing.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.098
He just disappeared.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.367
- Why would he
abandon his own house?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.635
Did you notify the police?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.056
- Yes, absolutely.

10:08.057 --> 10:10.274
They conducted a thorough
search but they found nothing.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.677
In the end, the police
gave up and,

10:13.647 --> 10:16.681
well, people don't just
disappear, Mrs. Woodhouse.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.416
- I agree.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.052
(somber music)

10:24.558 --> 10:26.224
- Are you all right?

10:26.226 --> 10:28.193
- Yes,

10:28.194 --> 10:30.161
I've just been suffering
with these awful migraines.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.531
The hospital said it's
due to mild concussion.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.867
They will pass.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.703
- Forgive me if I'm speaking out
of turn,

10:38.705 --> 10:40.639
but what happened?

10:42.576 --> 10:44.609
- The air raid siren,

10:44.611 --> 10:47.278
it wasn't as prompt as usual

10:47.280 --> 10:49.247
and I was knocked unconscious

10:49.249 --> 10:51.650
whilst going towards the
shelter.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.418
It's fine, though, please don't
worry.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.619
- As you wish.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.623
Well, when you're ready,

10:58.625 --> 11:01.726
I'll collect my belongings
and leave you to settle in.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.428
- Leave, tonight?

11:04.231 --> 11:06.131
- Actually, in about an hour.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.167
I've finished packing
and I was just sorting

11:09.169 --> 11:11.703
the last bits and pieces
when you arrived.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.104
It's lucky you caught me.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.842
Mrs. Baylock has passed away.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.145
There is no reason
for me to stay.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.614
- Have you made
arrangements to move on too?

11:23.717 --> 11:28.186
- Not yet, but I plan to
stay with family in London.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.023
- I don't think London's
a very safe place

11:32.025 --> 11:33.224
to be at the moment.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.093
- I have nowhere else to go.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.530
- Well of course you do,
you could stay here with me.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.232
It's a big house and
I'll need the help.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.501
- That's very generous of you.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.136
If you're certain.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.539
- I'm not much of a
traditionalist.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.475
I'm not very good at
housekeeping.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.344
- Well, thank you, sincerely.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.683
- I'm sorry, I don't
mean to offend you but

11:58.685 --> 12:00.285
you look very tired.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.322
Have you not been sleeping
well since Susanna passed?

12:05.492 --> 12:06.458
- Possibly not.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.827
There's been so much to tend to.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.163
- And I suppose with me not
being here,

12:12.165 --> 12:13.865
there's been a lot for one
person.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.401
- No, no, I didn't mean
to insinuate anything,

12:16.403 --> 12:18.203
I didn't mind doing it.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.309
- Can we have a look around?

12:24.311 --> 12:25.844
- Yes, of course.

12:30.717 --> 12:34.519
Mrs. Baylock hired me as
live-in help nine years ago.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.454
It was only when her
illness progressed

12:36.456 --> 12:38.823
that I became her carer.

12:38.825 --> 12:42.093
Mr. Baylock was always too
busy to tend to her needs.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.461
- Sorry, what illness?

12:45.232 --> 12:48.266
- Mrs. Baylock became very
ill over the past three years.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.936
I'm sorry, Mrs. Woodhouse,
did you not know?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.439
- No.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.308
- Your sister was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.910
It progressed rather rapidly.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.880
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

13:03.116 --> 13:07.152
If it's any consolation,
she was always very happy.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.788
(somber music)

13:17.631 --> 13:20.231
- So, whose room's whose?

13:21.034 --> 13:23.635
- My room's at the end
of the hall on the left,

13:23.637 --> 13:26.404
the room on the right
was Mr. Baylock's study.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.808
This was Mrs. Baylock's room,

13:30.677 --> 13:32.644
which can be yours if you like.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.312
- Yes, I would like that.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.114
- Well, I'll leave
you to settle in.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.550
I'll be downstairs
should you need anything.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.450
- Thank you.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.306
(somber music)

14:12.018 --> 14:15.086
- [Susanna] Do you realize
the irreversible damage

14:15.088 --> 14:16.588
you've caused?

14:16.590 --> 14:18.389
- [Patricia] Susanna, I don't
understand.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.657
- [Susanna] I want you to leave,
Patricia,

14:19.659 --> 14:21.059
I never want to see you again!

14:21.061 --> 14:22.961
- [Patricia] Please, Susanna,
I'm sorry.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.630
You're all that I have,
don't send me away.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.798
- [Susanna] Go!

14:26.800 --> 14:28.233
Now!

14:28.235 --> 14:30.902
(somber music)

15:58.124 --> 16:00.925
(big band music)

16:07.667 --> 16:11.169
¶ You know I've got
a wonderful feeling ¶

16:11.171 --> 16:13.438
¶ My heart is reeling ¶

16:13.440 --> 16:16.841
¶ With love for you ¶

16:16.843 --> 16:20.311
¶ I see you movin'
out on the dancefloor ¶

16:20.313 --> 16:22.413
¶ I never want more ¶

16:22.415 --> 16:25.616
¶ Than to be with you ¶

16:27.020 --> 16:28.219
- Annabel?

16:28.221 --> 16:31.556
¶ I think my heart is
up on the ceiling ¶

16:31.558 --> 16:33.825
¶ It's just not healing ¶

16:33.827 --> 16:37.228
¶ I'm off the ground ¶

16:37.230 --> 16:40.565
¶ Not long ago that
I was grieving ¶

16:40.567 --> 16:42.834
¶ Now I'm believing ¶
(light flickering)

16:42.836 --> 16:46.404
¶ In what I've found ¶

16:46.406 --> 16:48.906
(big band music)

16:48.908 --> 16:51.209
¶ Don't give me up ¶

16:51.211 --> 16:53.644
¶ Don't ever stop ¶

16:53.646 --> 16:55.947
¶ We've got to dance ¶

16:55.949 --> 16:58.683
¶ On the way up ¶

17:11.231 --> 17:14.932
¶ Tomorrow we'll have
some when I come ¶

17:14.934 --> 17:17.068
¶ How insightful ¶

17:17.069 --> 17:19.871
(big band music)

17:30.016 --> 17:32.984
(mysterious music)

18:21.568 --> 18:24.302
(ominous music)

18:25.972 --> 18:27.772
(gunshot echoing)

18:27.774 --> 18:30.074
(thudding)

18:31.878 --> 18:34.846
(mysterious music)

19:03.877 --> 19:06.611
(intense music)

19:08.915 --> 19:11.149
(gasping)

19:12.285 --> 19:13.718
- Annabel.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.453
You scared me.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.654
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.122
- It's okay.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.324
(gasping)

19:20.326 --> 19:22.727
What are you doing up?

19:22.729 --> 19:25.363
- I was just coming down to
see if you wanted anything.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.731
- Oh.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.766
No, I'm fine, thank you.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.802
My heart is pounding.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.505
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.508
I'm just going to go back to bed

19:37.510 --> 19:39.610
and see if I can get some sleep.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.846
I feel so silly.
(laughing)

19:41.848 --> 19:44.315
- Good night.
- Good night, Annabel.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.150
(laughing)

19:46.152 --> 19:48.019
(leaves rustling)

19:48.021 --> 19:50.688
(somber music)

20:03.770 --> 20:05.937
(knocking)

20:05.939 --> 20:06.837
Come in!

20:11.244 --> 20:12.510
(knocking)

20:12.512 --> 20:13.911
The door's open.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.935
Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.837
Did you sleep well last night?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.472
- Not very well.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.308
But then I never sleep well
anywhere the first night.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.877
Did you want me?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.479
- I'm sorry?

20:48.481 --> 20:51.315
- Just a moment ago, did you
not just knock on my door?

20:51.317 --> 20:53.484
- No, I was downstairs.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.055
- Never mind.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.992
Why are you awake so early?

21:00.994 --> 21:02.593
- I'm not too sure.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.895
Old habits, I suppose.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.131
I was just on my way up
to see if you were awake

21:07.133 --> 21:08.799
and see if you wanted
anything to eat.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.668
- Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.502
I'll be okay.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.770
(creaking)

21:12.772 --> 21:14.372
What was that?
- Hmm?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.873
- [Patricia] That noise.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.309
- We had new water pipes
installed recently.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.279
I bet that's what you heard.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.648
- Yes.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.548
I suppose.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.052
Would you like to come in?

21:28.054 --> 21:28.953
- Thank you.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.266
Always wondered what
was in that box.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.303
I often asked her,
your sister about it.

21:46.139 --> 21:49.840
But she either ignored me or
pushed the box under the bed

21:49.842 --> 21:51.475
and pretended she hadn't heard.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.746
- They're,

21:54.747 --> 21:56.881
they're just old photographs
of me and Susanna.

21:58.418 --> 22:01.185
Some are from when
we were children.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.821
I think, after I moved out,

22:03.823 --> 22:06.290
she must've taken them
all out of the frames and

22:07.360 --> 22:08.793
put them in this box.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.694
It was,

22:10.763 --> 22:13.364
it was like she just
wanted to forget about me.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.736
- I know this is none
of my business but

22:18.738 --> 22:21.038
why did you both become so
distant?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.207
- I told you,

22:24.277 --> 22:25.176
Victor.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.678
- What happened?

22:30.850 --> 22:33.684
- After our parents died,

22:33.686 --> 22:35.920
I moved in with
Victor and Susanna.

22:36.889 --> 22:37.788
I was young

22:38.925 --> 22:41.559
but I wasn't so naive.

22:42.795 --> 22:46.097
Victor started showing an
interest in me

22:47.600 --> 22:48.632
and after time

22:49.635 --> 22:50.534
became

22:51.871 --> 22:52.770
more intense.

22:54.374 --> 22:58.509
I tried to tell Susanna about it
and

22:58.511 --> 23:01.011
she was furious.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.380
I remember her saying,

23:03.683 --> 23:06.517
"He's invited you into his home,

23:06.519 --> 23:09.387
"how can you accuse
him of such acts?"

23:11.991 --> 23:14.458
She just didn't believe me.

23:14.460 --> 23:17.895
And after that, she forced
me to leave.

23:20.366 --> 23:22.600
And then, 15 years later,

23:24.404 --> 23:25.302
here I am.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.705
My sister's gone.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.007
- I'm really sorry.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.347
Sorry, I should've asked.
- No, no.

23:36.349 --> 23:38.048
- May I?
- Of course.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.625
- Oh.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.962
Well, what would you
like me to do today?

23:53.099 --> 23:53.998
- Well,

23:54.801 --> 23:57.968
I was thinking that
maybe you could

23:57.970 --> 24:01.472
start with boxing
up Susanna's things.

24:01.474 --> 24:04.208
And then I can go
through them and sort out

24:04.210 --> 24:05.976
anything that I'd
like to keep and

24:05.978 --> 24:08.813
I don't know, the rest I was,

24:08.815 --> 24:11.582
I was thinking I might
just donate it to charity.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.017
- All right.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.019
If there's anything else,
just call.

24:15.955 --> 24:16.854
- Thank you.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.982
(ominous music)

24:48.154 --> 24:50.387
(gasping)

24:52.859 --> 24:54.058
Annabel, I'm going out!

24:55.595 --> 24:58.863
(ominous music)
(gasping)

24:58.865 --> 25:00.197
- Sorry, I keep scaring you.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.200
- Annabel, there's
someone in the house.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.568
- [Annabel] Sorry?

25:04.570 --> 25:07.037
- In the living room, I just saw
them.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.907
- Oh I've just come from
there, there's no one there.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.309
- Annabel, I saw them.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.845
- Mrs. Woodhouse, I've
just come from that room,

25:14.847 --> 25:16.013
there's no one in there.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.314
- I saw them.

25:18.351 --> 25:21.218
- I can assure you, there
is no one in that room.

25:22.488 --> 25:25.089
Listen, forgive me
speaking out of turn

25:25.091 --> 25:27.558
but I think that the stress
over the last couple of days

25:27.560 --> 25:29.159
has got to you.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.562
I think perhaps you should
go and get some fresh air.

25:31.564 --> 25:32.463
- Yes.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.399
Maybe you're right.

25:35.401 --> 25:36.767
Will you come with me?

25:36.769 --> 25:39.503
- My apologies,
Mrs. Woodhouse, I can't.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.374
The weather plays
havoc on my arthritis.

25:44.477 --> 25:47.745
- Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.

25:47.747 --> 25:48.913
- You needn't worry.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.283
- Annabel, do you
have the address

25:52.285 --> 25:53.717
for where Susanna's buried?

25:53.719 --> 25:55.753
- Yes, of course,
Gallow's Cemetery.

25:55.755 --> 25:59.356
I'll find a pen and write
down the plot details for you.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.992
(somber music)

26:09.001 --> 26:11.068
I'm sorry, I can't find a pen.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.470
- Oh.

26:13.472 --> 26:16.307
It's okay, I'll find it.

26:16.309 --> 26:17.641
Thank you.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.277
(somber music)

26:27.787 --> 26:29.587
- Okay, see you next week.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.888
See you next week,
Mrs. Newstead.

26:30.890 --> 26:31.889
- Thank you, bye.
- Excuse me.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.524
- Hello.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.158
- Hi, looks like I've
come at the right time.

26:35.161 --> 26:38.596
- Weekly WI meeting, doing
our bit for the country.

26:38.598 --> 26:39.964
Were you interested in joining?

26:39.966 --> 26:43.634
- No, it's just I don't think
I'd be able to contribute much

26:43.636 --> 26:47.738
apart from burnt jam, maybe?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.673
- We all start somewhere.

26:49.675 --> 26:53.510
If you're not here for jam
making or flower arranging,

26:53.512 --> 26:54.912
how can I help?

26:54.914 --> 26:56.947
- My sister passed
quite recently

26:56.949 --> 27:00.684
and I was told that I might
be able to find her in here.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.853
I was unable to
attend the funeral

27:02.855 --> 27:05.389
so I don't know
where her plot is.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.357
- I'm very sorry.

27:06.359 --> 27:10.394
This is my husband's parish
and he's away at the moment

27:10.396 --> 27:13.297
but if you give me two
ticks I can run inside

27:13.299 --> 27:14.632
and find the details for you.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.800
- Thank you.
- What was your sister's name?

27:16.802 --> 27:17.935
- Susanna Baylock.

27:19.472 --> 27:20.471
- Oh.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.439
(somber music)

27:22.441 --> 27:24.975
- Is everything all right?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.644
- You must be Patricia.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.112
- Yes.

27:28.114 --> 27:31.281
- Me and Susanna
were close friends.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.517
She used to help me
with the WI meetings.

27:35.821 --> 27:36.820
I'm very sorry.

27:38.691 --> 27:39.590
- Me too.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.027
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.696
(somber music)

28:03.816 --> 28:04.982
- Just there.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.458
I'll be inside if
you need anything.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.360
- Thank you.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.996
(somber music)

28:25.204 --> 28:26.270
Susanna Baylock.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.374
1900 to 1944.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.412
I'm sorry, Susanna.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.715
(birds chirping)

28:37.717 --> 28:38.615
I really am.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.987
Should've come sooner,
I should've been here

28:43.989 --> 28:45.723
looking after you, it's just...

28:47.626 --> 28:50.060
I was stubborn and

28:51.697 --> 28:55.365
thought that we'd have many
more years to make things right.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.871
(sniffling)

29:00.873 --> 29:01.872
I love you.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.144
Should've told you sooner.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.818
I hope that you can forgive me.

29:14.820 --> 29:15.719
Sorry.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.962
(birds chirping)

29:24.964 --> 29:27.865
(thunder booming)

29:32.104 --> 29:33.003
Annabel?

29:34.640 --> 29:36.340
Annabel, I'm home.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.577
- Oh, Mrs. Woodhouse,
you're wet through!

29:40.579 --> 29:42.379
- I know, the rain came

29:42.381 --> 29:44.748
and I didn't even think
to take an umbrella.

29:45.518 --> 29:48.485
- I'll run you a bath, you
go and make yourself a drink,

29:48.487 --> 29:51.388
you need to warm up,
you'll catch your death.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.389
- Thank you.

29:52.391 --> 29:57.427
(clock striking)
(thunder booming)

29:58.097 --> 30:00.831
(phone ringing)

30:05.271 --> 30:06.436
Hello?

30:06.438 --> 30:09.106
- [Woman] Please help me!

30:09.108 --> 30:10.240
- Who is this?

30:10.242 --> 30:12.209
- [Woman] He's taken
everything from me!

30:12.211 --> 30:14.378
(electricity flickering)

30:14.380 --> 30:17.114
(ominous music)

30:32.131 --> 30:33.297
- Annabel?

30:33.299 --> 30:36.466
(thunder booming)

30:36.468 --> 30:39.203
(ominous music)

31:06.732 --> 31:09.066
(scraping)

31:12.771 --> 31:14.338
- Mrs. Woodhouse?

31:14.340 --> 31:15.739
What's wrong?

31:15.741 --> 31:19.309
- I heard something
coming from the attic.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.915
Where were you, I was calling.

31:24.917 --> 31:28.352
- I'm sorry, when the power
went out I went to get a candle.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.855
These outages are becoming
more and more frequent.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.157
A sound, you say?

31:34.159 --> 31:35.058
- Yes.

31:37.630 --> 31:38.662
Have you got a key?

31:39.899 --> 31:41.031
- No.

31:41.033 --> 31:44.401
To be honest, I don't think
I've ever been up there.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.569
What did you hear?

31:47.439 --> 31:48.338
- I'm not sure.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.141
- Probably mice.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.246
- Yes, maybe.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.783
- Well, you go in to get
ready and I'll run your bath.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.853
- Okay, thank you.

32:10.496 --> 32:15.565
(rain falling)
(thunder rumbling)

32:23.542 --> 32:26.443
(thunder booming)

32:34.853 --> 32:37.487
(sighing)

32:37.489 --> 32:42.559
(footsteps echoing)
(floorboards creaking)

32:44.296 --> 32:47.364
(suspenseful music)

33:07.119 --> 33:09.753
(intense music)

33:09.755 --> 33:12.155
(screaming)

33:16.295 --> 33:18.695
(screaming)

33:24.069 --> 33:26.203
(crying)

33:29.541 --> 33:31.008
- [Annabel] Mrs.
Woodhouse, what's going on?

33:31.010 --> 33:32.476
- There's something
in my room, Annabel,

33:32.478 --> 33:33.977
I need to get out of the house.

33:33.979 --> 33:35.445
- What's happened?

33:35.446 --> 33:36.912
- There's something up the
stairs, it's in my room,

33:36.915 --> 33:38.415
please let me go out!

33:38.417 --> 33:39.516
- [Annabel] There's nothing
in your room.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.517
- There is, please!

33:40.519 --> 33:42.552
No, don't touch me,
Annabel, don't!

33:42.554 --> 33:44.421
Please, I need to get
out of the house!

33:44.423 --> 33:45.922
- You need to come and sit down!

33:45.924 --> 33:47.657
- I don't want to, there's
something up the stairs!

33:47.659 --> 33:49.793
- Quickly, quickly, into the
basement.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.795
- [Patricia] Oh, Annabel!

33:51.797 --> 33:55.365
(air raid sirens blaring)

34:01.073 --> 34:03.206
- [Annabel] What on Earth
has gotten into you?

34:03.208 --> 34:05.409
- I don't know, Annabel.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.577
- Just tell me, please.

34:10.149 --> 34:13.116
- I don't even
know what happened.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.286
I couldn't see.

34:17.288 --> 34:18.286
I think something
has happened to me.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.290
- What do you mean?

34:20.292 --> 34:22.726
- I know how this is
gonna sound but

34:24.196 --> 34:26.329
something grabbed me and it was,

34:26.331 --> 34:28.197
it was hitting me.

34:29.001 --> 34:30.567
Oh, there's something
bad in here,

34:30.569 --> 34:31.868
we need to get out of the house.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.538
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.339
Annabel, there's something
really dark in here

34:36.341 --> 34:39.409
and we need to get out of this
house, something is wrong.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.143
- No, we're safe down here.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.980
Look, you just need
to get some sleep.

34:43.982 --> 34:44.848
- Annabel, I don't
want to go to sleep,

34:44.850 --> 34:47.684
I need to get
out of here, please.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.687
- Listen, Mrs. Woodhouse,
please just listen to yourself,

34:50.688 --> 34:52.155
you're sounding ridiculous.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.123
Just try to get some sleep.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.994
(airplanes droning)

35:00.599 --> 35:03.867
Get some rest, you'll feel so
much better in the morning.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.569
- You don't believe me, do you?

35:05.571 --> 35:06.970
- I didn't say I
didn't believe you,

35:06.972 --> 35:08.738
I just said you
needed some sleep.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.310
(sighing)

35:13.312 --> 35:16.780
(air raid sirens blaring)

35:16.782 --> 35:19.816
(suspenseful music)

35:45.010 --> 35:45.909
- Annabel.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.581
Annabel.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.317
(phone ringing)

36:08.867 --> 36:11.601
(ominous music)

36:27.686 --> 36:28.585
Hello?

36:37.362 --> 36:40.330
Who are you?
- Patricia, listen to me.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.499
We haven't got long,
he'll be here soon.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.634
You must leave while you can!

36:44.636 --> 36:46.436
- I'll ask you one
more time, who are you

36:46.438 --> 36:47.771
and what do you want?

36:47.773 --> 36:49.973
- Patricia, he needs you.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.043
He will kill you,
Patricia, leave, now!

36:54.580 --> 36:55.946
- What are you doing?

36:55.948 --> 36:57.013
(gasping)

36:57.015 --> 36:58.148
- He's coming!

36:58.150 --> 36:59.916
He can't have me!

36:59.918 --> 37:04.955
- No!
(thunder booming)

37:18.003 --> 37:20.237
(sighing)

37:31.883 --> 37:33.316
- Good morning.
- Oh.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.851
- How are you feeling?

37:34.853 --> 37:35.986
- Morning.

37:35.988 --> 37:38.255
Sorry I didn't wake you.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.223
You seemed quite content.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.124
- Thank you.

37:44.062 --> 37:44.961
- Just a

37:45.998 --> 37:47.797
strange feeling, isn't it?

37:49.134 --> 37:52.135
During the day the
house feels so normal

37:52.137 --> 37:54.838
and then at night it feels...

37:56.375 --> 37:57.807
Feels completely different.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.644
But

38:00.646 --> 38:03.113
I've decided that I
am going to stay.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.216
I won't be chased out.

38:06.218 --> 38:07.684
- I'm glad to hear it.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.321
How would you
like some breakfast?

38:11.323 --> 38:12.555
- No, thank you.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.693
I think I'm gonna go out.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.594
There's a few things
I need to look into.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.496
- All right.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.799
- I need some fresh air.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.769
- Sounds like a very good idea.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.340
- I'm just going to go get
dressed, okay?

38:30.342 --> 38:31.174
- All right.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.310
I'll finish up in here.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.544
- Okay.

38:34.546 --> 38:37.180
(somber music)

39:14.619 --> 39:16.920
(knocking)

39:21.493 --> 39:24.527
(suspenseful music)

39:45.684 --> 39:48.351
(rain falling)

39:58.330 --> 40:02.532
As the book says, there's lots
of different types of ghosts.

40:02.534 --> 40:07.070
There's your average ghost who
perhaps died on the premises.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.140
They might not even
know that they're dead.

40:10.142 --> 40:12.108
They mean you no harm,
they're just,

40:12.944 --> 40:15.445
well, just confused.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.580
And then there's the
other type of ghosts

40:17.582 --> 40:19.916
who do know that they're dead,

40:19.918 --> 40:23.686
they just choose to exist as
though they were still living.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.758
And then the book says
something about poltergeists.

40:30.295 --> 40:33.596
That comes from the German
meaning of "noisy ghosts."

40:33.598 --> 40:35.498
They're the ones that throw
things around

40:35.500 --> 40:36.533
and cause a ruckus.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.669
- All right.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.604
But you know if you
read these sort of books

40:41.606 --> 40:43.206
they'll put ideas in your mind.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.108
(laughing)

40:45.109 --> 40:47.009
- Well that's ridiculous,
I'm just trying to understand

40:47.012 --> 40:48.578
what's happening.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.547
- So you think it was a
poltergeist?

40:50.549 --> 40:51.448
- No.

40:53.018 --> 40:56.219
It says although poltergeists
seem threatening,

40:56.221 --> 40:57.720
they're actually harmless.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.759
Entities, on the other hand...

41:02.761 --> 41:03.660
- An entity?

41:04.596 --> 41:05.495
- Yes,

41:06.364 --> 41:08.164
it's a thing with distinct

41:08.166 --> 41:10.767
and independent existence.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.802
- What does that even mean?

41:12.804 --> 41:14.404
- Well,

41:14.406 --> 41:16.873
it means that,

41:16.875 --> 41:18.808
basically,

41:18.810 --> 41:22.645
they live on a different
plane to ours.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.416
These are the ones that
feed off our energy

41:26.418 --> 41:28.985
and wreak havoc
amongst the living.

41:28.987 --> 41:32.155
I think it was an entity which
attacked me the other night.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.724
- If you were attacked.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.393
- Well, I beg your pardon.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.696
- I wasn't insinuating
you were lying,

41:39.698 --> 41:41.731
there could be a number
of different explanations

41:41.733 --> 41:43.333
as to what happened.

41:43.335 --> 41:44.634
- For instance?

41:46.338 --> 41:49.405
- Maybe you were asleep and
dreaming you were being attacked

41:49.407 --> 41:51.508
and fell out of bed,
injuring yourself?

41:51.510 --> 41:53.243
- But I know that I was awake.

41:54.079 --> 41:56.112
- But you have no bruises.

41:57.449 --> 41:58.715
I could be right.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.184
- I know what happened.

42:02.487 --> 42:04.153
- Why don't we wait?
(scoffing)

42:04.155 --> 42:04.988
- Wait?

42:04.990 --> 42:06.222
Wait for what?

42:06.224 --> 42:07.690
- Before we get ahead of
ourselves,

42:07.692 --> 42:10.860
why don't we wait to see if
anything else should happen?

42:10.862 --> 42:13.530
I've been working here for over
nine years

42:13.532 --> 42:16.199
and nothing like this
has ever happened before.

42:19.271 --> 42:20.870
- Annabel, please believe me.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.190
(sighing)

42:24.191 --> 42:26.174
- I'm a rational person,
Mrs. Woodhouse,

42:26.177 --> 42:27.544
which makes me stubborn.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.119
(intense music)

42:36.121 --> 42:37.020
- Annabel!

42:38.056 --> 42:39.722
- What's wrong?
- That book,

42:40.859 --> 42:42.559
it just got pulled
from my hands!

42:44.596 --> 42:45.929
No!

42:45.931 --> 42:46.829
It did, believe me.

42:49.434 --> 42:51.935
Come on, come on,

42:51.937 --> 42:53.236
watch.

42:53.238 --> 42:56.306
(suspenseful music)

42:58.543 --> 43:01.344
(door slamming)
(screaming)

43:01.346 --> 43:04.047
(boards creaking)

43:04.049 --> 43:05.915
(gasping)

43:05.917 --> 43:08.318
(screaming)

43:12.190 --> 43:14.324
(crying)

43:16.027 --> 43:18.428
(screaming)

43:24.669 --> 43:26.736
- Make it stop!
- How?

43:26.738 --> 43:28.504
- I don't know, make it stop!

43:28.506 --> 43:29.839
(screaming)

43:29.841 --> 43:33.076
- Stop it, stop it!
- Stop it, stop it!

43:35.080 --> 43:37.313
(gasping)

43:38.617 --> 43:41.818
- What have you
brought into this house?

43:41.820 --> 43:43.720
- You're blaming me for this?

43:43.722 --> 43:46.456
- Strange things didn't
happen before you came here!

43:46.458 --> 43:49.258
- But you asked me to come here!

43:49.260 --> 43:51.194
- Pardon?
- You wrote me a letter,

43:51.196 --> 43:52.862
you asked me to come!

43:52.864 --> 43:54.364
- What do you mean I
asked you to come here?

43:54.366 --> 43:55.965
I never sent a letter!

43:55.967 --> 43:58.201
- Yes you did,
you sent me a letter!

43:58.203 --> 44:01.537
- I am sorry,
but you are mistaken!

44:01.539 --> 44:03.773
(gasping)

44:07.545 --> 44:08.478
- See, see?

44:08.480 --> 44:10.246
You sent me a letter!

44:10.248 --> 44:12.982
(ominous music)

44:15.086 --> 44:17.153
- I don't understand.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.554
This is my handwriting but

44:18.556 --> 44:20.056
I didn't send this letter!

44:20.058 --> 44:22.692
- But that's rubbish, Annabel!

44:22.694 --> 44:23.860
- No, really!

44:24.863 --> 44:26.896
I've never been so certain
of anything in my life!

44:26.898 --> 44:29.365
- Then how did a letter
in your handwriting

44:29.367 --> 44:30.833
show up on my doorstep?

44:30.835 --> 44:32.301
- I don't know!

44:32.303 --> 44:34.470
(crying)

44:35.306 --> 44:37.306
I don't know!

44:37.308 --> 44:39.809
Please, we've got to
get out of here!

44:39.811 --> 44:41.277
- No, I'm not going anywhere!

44:41.279 --> 44:43.746
I'm not gonna be
scared out of this house!

44:43.748 --> 44:45.715
- We can't stay here!

44:45.717 --> 44:47.950
(gasping)

44:52.624 --> 44:54.524
- Who are these women?

44:58.263 --> 44:59.796
- I don't know,

44:59.798 --> 45:01.898
relatives of Victor's maybe?
- No.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.101
He didn't have any family.

45:05.103 --> 45:07.070
I've dreamt about them.

45:07.906 --> 45:08.805
She...

45:09.674 --> 45:11.240
She warned me not to come here,

45:11.242 --> 45:15.478
she said that I would
be in danger from him.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.379
- Who?

45:17.782 --> 45:19.749
- I don't know, Victor?

45:20.719 --> 45:22.785
(gasping)

45:22.787 --> 45:25.521
And this one, I know her.

45:31.129 --> 45:32.628
Oh!

45:32.630 --> 45:34.764
(crying)

45:58.356 --> 45:59.889
God.

45:59.891 --> 46:02.191
(groaning)

46:12.337 --> 46:13.536
- Good morning.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.671
I take it you couldn't
sleep either?

46:15.673 --> 46:16.572
- No.

46:16.574 --> 46:20.943
- I found it nigh on impossible
to settle.

46:20.945 --> 46:23.446
This house has taken on a
very different form for me

46:23.448 --> 46:25.214
since last night.

46:25.216 --> 46:26.883
Every creak a whisper.

46:28.019 --> 46:29.285
What are you looking at?

46:30.555 --> 46:32.588
- Just the photographs
from last night.

46:34.692 --> 46:36.793
I need to know who
these people are.

46:37.896 --> 46:39.862
I have to get into the attic.

46:39.864 --> 46:41.497
- It's locked.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.099
There's no key that I know of.

46:44.903 --> 46:48.337
- I'll arrange for a locksmith
to come later on today.

46:48.339 --> 46:49.238
- Very good.

46:50.608 --> 46:53.676
(suspenseful music)

46:59.083 --> 47:00.283
- [Woman] Shh.

47:00.285 --> 47:02.151
- Oh, sorry.
(laughing)

47:02.153 --> 47:03.603
- That's all right.

47:03.604 --> 47:05.054
I haven't seen you around
here before, have I?

47:05.056 --> 47:07.423
- Oh, no, my name's Patricia.

47:07.425 --> 47:09.325
I'm just staying here a while.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.060
My sister recently passed.

47:11.062 --> 47:14.297
- Ah, you must be
Mrs. Baylock's sister.

47:14.299 --> 47:17.633
My condolences, she
was a very kind person.

47:17.635 --> 47:19.168
- Thank you.

47:19.170 --> 47:22.572
- And Victor, I noticed
he wasn't at the funeral,

47:22.574 --> 47:24.106
is he still missing?

47:24.108 --> 47:26.809
- Yes, unfortunately, he is.

47:26.811 --> 47:28.377
- Well, better off without him.

47:28.379 --> 47:30.213
Strange fellow.

47:30.215 --> 47:31.414
I never liked him.

47:31.416 --> 47:32.782
- What makes you say that?

47:34.118 --> 47:36.018
- It's not my business
to be spreading gossip,

47:36.020 --> 47:37.687
you understand?

47:37.689 --> 47:40.189
But he was never the
same after that party.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.191
You know, that tragic
party in the 20s?

47:47.699 --> 47:49.298
- Why, what happened?

47:49.300 --> 47:51.267
- Some mad person
got in with a gun

47:51.269 --> 47:53.936
and basically
shot everyone down.

47:53.938 --> 47:55.838
- That's awful.
- I know.

47:57.242 --> 47:59.609
And Victor was
the only survivor.

48:00.445 --> 48:02.245
A bit suspicious, if you ask me.

48:03.348 --> 48:05.114
But I'm not one
to spread gossip.

48:06.017 --> 48:10.253
But that house always does
encourage strange behavior.

48:11.556 --> 48:14.757
Even when I was a child
they used to talk about it,

48:14.759 --> 48:17.894
strange things, happenings,
people coming and going

48:17.896 --> 48:21.264
and one night there were
the most terrible screams!

48:21.266 --> 48:23.466
My blood turned cold.

48:23.468 --> 48:27.270
And I'm telling you, it
came from that house!

48:27.272 --> 48:29.805
But not that I'm one to--
- For gossiping.

48:29.807 --> 48:30.940
- No.

48:30.942 --> 48:33.709
Oh, I have to go, my
condolences.

48:33.711 --> 48:35.478
- Thank you.
- Bye.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.447
(mysterious music)

48:45.223 --> 48:46.989
- [Patricia] "10 people
have lost their lives

48:46.991 --> 48:49.959
"when what began as a seemingly
normal Saturday evening

48:49.961 --> 48:53.262
"on February 14th
ended in tragedy.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.398
"Police are still trying to
piece together

48:55.400 --> 48:57.533
"the events of that evening.

48:57.535 --> 48:59.201
"What is known at this time

48:59.203 --> 49:01.737
"is that most of the
guests had been poisoned

49:01.739 --> 49:03.472
"and a small majority
had received

49:03.474 --> 49:05.474
"a single gunshot
wound to the head.

49:05.476 --> 49:08.844
"Neighbors reportedly heard
screams followed by gunshots

49:08.846 --> 49:11.580
"at around 9:30 P.M.

49:11.582 --> 49:14.250
"When police arrived at 24
Richmond Drive

49:14.252 --> 49:16.385
"they found the home
owner Victor Baylock

49:16.387 --> 49:19.422
"outside the residence in
a state of complete shock.

49:19.424 --> 49:22.158
"Victor was the only survivor."

49:22.160 --> 49:24.794
(somber music)

49:27.031 --> 49:29.332
"The case of the people
versus Victor Baylock

49:29.334 --> 49:30.933
"has finally come to an end

49:30.935 --> 49:35.871
"when Judge Simons cleared
Victor of all accounts of murder

49:35.873 --> 49:38.507
"and ruled the shooting
as a tragic incident

49:39.711 --> 49:41.344
"and nothing more."

49:46.651 --> 49:47.950
- What am I looking at?

49:47.952 --> 49:49.986
- Well I found this
book in the library

49:49.988 --> 49:52.455
and then I came across this
picture.

49:52.457 --> 49:56.225
Do you see anyone you
recognize particularly?

49:56.227 --> 49:57.660
- No.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.762
- Look towards the
back of the photo.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.833
- Is that--
- Victor, yes!

50:03.835 --> 50:05.634
You see it too.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.803
- Well it certainly
looks like him.

50:07.805 --> 50:11.474
- Well this group, they
were arrested for Satanism.

50:11.476 --> 50:14.777
They were members
of the Aeternum Cult.

50:14.779 --> 50:19.849
This photo, it was taken in
1865 outside this very house.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.518
- Well it can't be Victor then.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.688
- All but one was arrested
and brought to justice

50:25.690 --> 50:28.858
on five counts of
murder in 1866.

50:30.895 --> 50:34.296
Charles King, Alice Estherman

50:34.298 --> 50:35.564
and Walter Haybridge.

50:36.567 --> 50:39.001
And then the other
just disappeared

50:39.003 --> 50:41.203
and was never heard of again.

50:42.106 --> 50:43.005
And he

50:44.809 --> 50:45.808
was Taylor Bivcock.

50:47.612 --> 50:51.347
Now when Taylor disappeared,
the house, it was sold

50:51.349 --> 50:54.283
and it passed through many
different people's hands

50:54.285 --> 50:57.520
until 1904 when it was bought...

50:59.290 --> 51:00.256
By Victor Baylock.

51:01.325 --> 51:04.493
Now it didn't take
me too long to work out

51:04.495 --> 51:07.997
that Taylor Bivcock is an
anagram for Victor Baylock.

51:09.867 --> 51:13.135
Did you know that in 1920,

51:13.137 --> 51:15.704
a mass murder happened
in this house?

51:15.706 --> 51:18.074
- No, I didn't, that's terrible!

51:18.076 --> 51:21.610
- Yes, they died at a party
that Victor was holding

51:21.612 --> 51:24.413
and he was the sole survivor.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.582
And the strangeness,
it doesn't end there.

51:28.319 --> 51:32.588
A year previous, his wife, Mary,

51:32.590 --> 51:34.924
she disappeared without a trace.

51:34.926 --> 51:37.927
And 15 years previous to that,

51:37.929 --> 51:40.796
his wife Nellie,
she also disappeared

51:40.798 --> 51:43.032
and has never been seen again.

51:43.034 --> 51:46.102
People said that she
went mad because

51:46.904 --> 51:50.840
her son, he was kidnapped
from her outside a local shop.

51:51.909 --> 51:55.277
People said that she used to
wander up and down the streets

51:55.279 --> 51:56.812
clutching that toy.

51:58.015 --> 52:00.182
She claimed it was
her son, George.

52:03.287 --> 52:05.454
Before that, there was Shirley.

52:06.724 --> 52:09.391
Now I'm guessing that
Shirley met the same ill fate

52:09.393 --> 52:10.426
as these two.

52:12.563 --> 52:14.763
And then, his current wife...

52:16.267 --> 52:17.233
My sister,

52:18.669 --> 52:20.102
mysteriously dies.

52:22.907 --> 52:24.607
- All this is making me very
uneasy.

52:24.609 --> 52:26.526
- And it should!

52:26.527 --> 52:28.444
Listen, I don't know
what's going on but

52:28.446 --> 52:31.413
I know that Victor has
something to do with it.

52:31.415 --> 52:34.083
You said something to
me that stayed with me,

52:34.085 --> 52:37.653
you said that people
just don't disappear.

52:37.655 --> 52:39.021
- Yes, I did indeed.

52:39.023 --> 52:40.823
- And I couldn't agree more.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.224
You're right, they don't.

52:44.295 --> 52:45.194
I think,

52:46.264 --> 52:48.264
I think he's still here.

52:48.266 --> 52:51.600
- What do you mean?
- I know he's dead but,

52:51.602 --> 52:54.637
I just get a feeling.

52:55.573 --> 52:59.608
When Victor was alive,
he would enter a room

52:59.610 --> 53:02.978
and he would bring with
him a palpable presence,

53:02.980 --> 53:05.447
it was a darkness on the room.

53:06.384 --> 53:08.751
And I still feel it now
in this house.

53:10.588 --> 53:14.523
- Look, we should leave,
it's clearly not safe here.

53:14.525 --> 53:17.459
- Annabel, if you wish to leave,
you can

53:17.461 --> 53:19.762
and I won't make you stay.

53:19.764 --> 53:22.231
But I believe that Victor
has something to do

53:22.233 --> 53:24.633
with my sister's death
and I'm not going

53:24.635 --> 53:26.101
until I've proven it!

53:28.139 --> 53:30.005
- Well I'm not leaving
you here alone.

53:30.007 --> 53:31.207
That wouldn't be right.

53:32.009 --> 53:34.543
- We have to get into the attic.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.713
(air raid sirens wailing)

53:37.715 --> 53:38.781
Not now.

53:38.783 --> 53:40.616
- Come on, quickly.

53:40.618 --> 53:44.186
(air raid sirens wailing)

54:04.242 --> 54:06.475
(sighing)

54:15.987 --> 54:18.754
- When the sirens stop, we
should go into the attic.

54:19.724 --> 54:22.324
I bet we'll find some
answers in there.

54:22.326 --> 54:23.559
- Please, Mrs. Woodhouse,
I don't want to think

54:23.561 --> 54:25.027
about that right now.

54:27.064 --> 54:27.963
- All right.

54:28.799 --> 54:29.698
I'm sorry.

54:34.505 --> 54:37.573
(airplanes roaring)

54:38.342 --> 54:40.709
- Damned war,
will it ever be over?

54:43.614 --> 54:45.681
- I, for one, would
like to see it end.

54:45.683 --> 54:47.916
Hitler's taken
everything from me.

54:50.955 --> 54:52.921
On the day that
I received your...

54:54.925 --> 54:55.991
The letter...

54:57.595 --> 54:59.194
I received another.

54:59.196 --> 55:01.463
(somber music)

55:01.465 --> 55:04.700
Said that my husband,
Jacob, had been killed.

55:07.838 --> 55:09.805
He was fighting in Germany and

55:10.941 --> 55:14.410
he was helping an orphan
and stepped on a land mine.

55:18.382 --> 55:21.817
In one morning I'd lost
my sister and my husband.

55:25.122 --> 55:26.355
That's my whole family.

55:30.695 --> 55:32.328
That's when I heard the sirens.

55:35.499 --> 55:36.398
I...

55:36.400 --> 55:41.170
left the house and went to make
my way towards the shelter,

55:43.074 --> 55:44.540
I'd just got a safe distance

55:44.542 --> 55:46.208
when the bomb had hit my street.

55:48.713 --> 55:51.413
In an instant my house was gone.

55:55.720 --> 55:59.855
I woke up three days
later in the hospital.

55:59.857 --> 56:02.091
Was just cuts and bruises.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.429
I went back to
the house to collect

56:09.467 --> 56:11.467
anything that
I could find, really.

56:14.004 --> 56:15.204
It was so strange,

56:17.541 --> 56:19.274
that's when I found the letter.

56:20.144 --> 56:23.145
Everything was destroyed,
but the letter, it was

56:24.582 --> 56:25.681
untouched.

56:25.683 --> 56:28.317
(somber music)

56:30.755 --> 56:32.788
I went to the train station,

56:33.758 --> 56:35.224
bought a one-way ticket and

56:37.228 --> 56:38.093
here I am.

56:40.264 --> 56:41.096
(sighing)

56:41.098 --> 56:42.398
The truth is, Annabel,

56:44.969 --> 56:46.769
that I had nowhere else to go

56:48.672 --> 56:51.573
and if that bomb
hadn't have hit,

56:53.177 --> 56:55.277
I'm not even sure I would've
come.

56:55.279 --> 56:57.513
(somber music)

56:57.515 --> 57:00.649
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Woodhouse.

57:00.651 --> 57:03.585
But the important
thing is you came.

57:03.587 --> 57:06.021
I'm sure Mrs. Baylock
would be grateful

57:06.023 --> 57:06.922
no matter reason.

57:08.959 --> 57:11.360
(explosion booming)

57:11.362 --> 57:15.931
Dear me, that one sounded a
bit too close for comfort.

57:17.067 --> 57:20.102
Maybe you should
try and get some rest.

57:20.104 --> 57:22.805
- Even if I wanted to sleep
I'm not sure if I could.

57:23.808 --> 57:27.176
My mind's racing about
so many questions.

57:28.345 --> 57:30.245
What was Victor up to?

57:31.982 --> 57:34.750
(clock striking)

57:34.752 --> 57:37.753
(airplane droning)

57:51.969 --> 57:54.937
(mysterious music)

58:00.311 --> 58:02.644
(groaning)

58:14.525 --> 58:16.859
(knocking)

58:46.457 --> 58:49.191
(ominous music)

59:00.905 --> 59:03.105
(gasping)

59:06.210 --> 59:08.944
(intense music)

59:20.624 --> 59:23.025
(screaming)

59:48.919 --> 59:51.653
- [Victor] I killed them all.

59:51.655 --> 59:54.323
(ominous music)

59:54.325 --> 59:56.358
- Mary!
- Patricia!

59:56.360 --> 59:57.960
You must leave now!

59:57.962 --> 59:59.595
You're running out of time!

59:59.597 --> 01:00:01.330
- What's happening?

01:00:01.332 --> 01:00:03.365
Did Victor kill you?

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.467
Did he kill Susanna?

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:08.503
- Leave, and I promise,
I'll tell you everything!

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:12.274
- No, Mary, I need to
know what's happening!

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.842
- I killed myself!

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:15.611
- What?

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:19.214
- Go, now!

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:20.582
(gasping)

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:22.551
- Mrs. Woodhouse,
are you all right?

01:00:22.553 --> 01:00:24.720
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:29.992
(air raid sirens wailing)
- Oh, finally.

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.426
- Mrs. Woodhouse, wait!

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:34.162
(ominous music)

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:39.234
Mrs. Woodhouse,
what are you doing?

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:40.569
- In my dream,

01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:43.372
they were trying to show
me something, Annabel.

01:00:43.374 --> 01:00:45.073
- What could possibly
be in those books?

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:46.375
- [Patricia] I don't know!

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.646
- Please calm down,
you're getting hysterical!

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:51.513
- Annabel, Victor
is up to something

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:54.349
and I have to find
out what it is!

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:58.353
- Mrs. Woodhouse, stop!

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:59.488
Stop, please!

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:01.456
Stop!

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:04.192
(ominous music)

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:17.873
(groaning)

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.148
(thudding)

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.486
(gasping)

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.451
(groaning)

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.269
(gasping)

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:22.704
What are we looking for?

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.474
- I'm not sure.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.350
I've seen her before.

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:38.854
What's in that box?

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:41.590
(ominous music)

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:11.987
The eclipse.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:13.722
- Sorry?

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:17.225
- It says here that

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:21.196
the sacrifice can only
be made on the eclipse.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:23.231
- The lunar eclipse is tonight.

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:32.340
- Listen to this,

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.878
it says that the
Aeternum Cult originated

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.215
in Italy in 1790

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:42.884
and was founded
by one Victor Baylock.

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:48.957
It says that the Cult sought
after the infamous devil tree

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:52.194
and moved to England to
continue their search.

01:03:55.566 --> 01:03:58.133
The Cult ceased to exist in 1866

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:03.538
when they were caught and
executed for Satanism.

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:10.512
- Patricia.

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:13.014
I can't stay here.

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:15.350
I'm going to collect
my belongings

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:18.420
and I will be leaving
when I'm done.

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:20.755
- I understand.

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.932
(groaning)

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:52.387
(ominous music)

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:57.959
(attic door slamming)

01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:58.860
Annabel!

01:04:58.862 --> 01:05:00.061
Annabel!

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.997
Annabel, I'm locked in!

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.733
Annabel, Annabel, I'm locked in!

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:06.735
Annabel!

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.037
(laughing)

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:13.341
Annabel!

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:15.977
Let me out, let me out!

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:18.280
(groaning)

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.583
(crying)

01:05:22.853 --> 01:05:25.987
(overlapping voices)

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:36.998
(laughing)

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.834
(big band music)

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:03.491
(glasses clinking)

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:14.336
(laughing)

01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:24.679
(big band music)

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:30.618
¶ You know I've got
a wonderful feeling ¶

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.787
¶ My heart is reeling ¶

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:36.291
¶ With love for you ¶

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:39.961
¶ I see you movin' out
on the dancefloor ¶

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:41.930
¶ I never want more ¶

01:06:41.932 --> 01:06:47.002
¶ Than to be with you ¶

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:51.072
¶ I think my heart is
up on the ceiling ¶

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:53.274
¶ It's just not healing ¶

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:56.745
¶ I'm off the ground ¶

01:06:56.747 --> 01:07:00.115
¶ Not long ago
that I was grieving ¶

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:05.153
¶ Now I'm believing in
what I've found ¶

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:10.759
¶ Don't give me up ¶

01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:13.194
¶ Don't ever stop ¶

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.364
¶ We've got to dance ¶

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:21.336
(suspenseful music)

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:35.316
(screaming)

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.619
(gunshots)

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:45.060
(creaking)

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.002
- Annabel?

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:57.305
Annabel?

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.210
Annabel?

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:04.446
(gasping)

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:16.457
Annabel?

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.693
(gasping)

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.800
(groaning)

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.777
(crying)

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:11.145
What are you showing me?

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:14.215
(suspenseful music)

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.154
There's nothing here!

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:24.325
What are you showing me?

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.426
There's nothing...

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:29.163
(ominous music)

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:13.174
(thudding)

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:03.985
(thudding)

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:11.025
(gasping)

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:12.960
(screaming)

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:13.861
Annabel!

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:16.297
Annabel!

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.966
Annabel, help me!

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:21.969
(screaming)

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:22.870
Annabel!

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:25.907
(cracking)

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:26.974
(screaming)

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:28.409
Annabel!

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:31.179
(intense music)

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:33.581
(screaming)

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:48.629
Annabel!

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:50.932
- What is it?
- Victor, he's here.

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:53.801
I've seen him and
I've found them all.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.536
- Who?
- All of them.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:00.708
Winifred, Shirley, Nellie,
Mary, they're all there!

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.276
- [Annabel] Where?

01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:04.512
- Their bodies.

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.381
Hid them in the attic.

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:08.883
- Listen to me, please,
please Patricia,

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:11.352
whatever darkness
is in this house

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:13.421
it's just getting stronger.

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:15.590
It's building, it's like,

01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:17.892
like the energy you
get before a storm,

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:21.496
something very bad is going
to happen here tonight.

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:22.764
Please, just leave with me now?

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:23.931
- Yes, yes.

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:31.172
Oh God.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.408
(gasping)

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:36.677
¶ I've got a wonderful feeling ¶

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:38.246
¶ My heart is reeling ¶

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:39.080
- Annabel?

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.882
¶ With love for you ¶

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:42.417
(gasping)

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:43.484
(murmured lyrics)

01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:46.120
Annabel, do you hear that?

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.990
(murmured lyrics)

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:52.760
(laughing)

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:54.529
(door slamming)
(gasping)

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.430
No.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.604
(hissing)

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:10.978
(ominous music)

01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:22.557
Victor, I'm not scared!

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:23.791
Where are you?

01:14:24.661 --> 01:14:25.560
Come out!

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.167
(screaming)

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:37.572
- Give in, Patricia.
- Never!

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:39.674
- You'll see Susanna again.

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:41.876
(gun clicking)
Give me the gun.

01:14:41.878 --> 01:14:44.045
Give me the gun, Patricia.

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:46.347
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:47.715
I'm already dead!

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:51.152
- Let's see!
(gunshot)

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.221
(crying)

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:55.356
Annabel, where are you?

01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:56.858
(crying)

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:57.758
Annabel!

01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:00.862
Annabel!
- Patricia.

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.997
(crying)

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:05.399
- Annabel?

01:15:06.436 --> 01:15:08.269
- [Annabel] Patricia.

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:11.305
- No, no, Annabel!

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:12.206
No!

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.409
(screaming)

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:21.682
- Patricia?

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.518
Patricia?
- Annabel!

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.352
- Patricia!

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:25.887
Don't shoot me,
put down the gun!

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:27.688
- Let's see!
- What are you saying?

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.924
(gunshot)

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:39.200
(hissing)

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:48.242
(screaming)

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:49.644
- [Patricia] No.

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:55.149
- [Susanna] Patricia, you
should never have come.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:57.785
- Is that really you?

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:02.189
Well I never thought
I'd see you again.

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:03.424
- I love that.

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:07.128
It's good to
see you too, Patricia

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:09.130
but I wish,

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.133
why didn't you listen to me?

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.002
I tried to warn you, I
tried to make you leave!

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:16.470
You've always been stubborn!

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:20.908
(screaming)

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:22.310
- What was that?

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:24.946
- The tortured.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:28.683
The damned roam here.

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:31.619
They never leave.

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:34.989
(crying)

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:43.831
- Please help me.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:47.201
He's taken everything from me!

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:49.003
Have you seen my baby?

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:50.972
Have you seen George?
- No.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:51.872
No, sorry.

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:54.675
Sorry, I haven't.

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:56.143
- I can hear him crying.

01:16:57.013 --> 01:16:58.713
But I can't find him.

01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:00.615
It's too dark, he's lost!

01:17:01.918 --> 01:17:04.552
My heart aches, it aches!

01:17:04.554 --> 01:17:07.288
- Listen, Nellie,
Nellie, I feel your pain,

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:08.723
I do, but you need to get out of
here.

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:11.058
You need to leave.
- I cannot.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.059
I shall not.

01:17:12.996 --> 01:17:14.729
(crying)
George?

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:17.198
- No, it's not George,
tell her it's not George.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.099
Nellie.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:25.072
- Nellie will not leave
until she finds George.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:26.424
- Mary?

01:17:26.425 --> 01:17:27.775
- We've tried many times
to get her to leave

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:29.243
but she will not.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:30.678
- Isn't there anything
we can do?

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.382
- Unfortunately not, it's
Nellie's choice to leave

01:17:34.384 --> 01:17:36.083
and hers alone.

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:38.185
- Mary, I'm so sorry, I
should've listened to you,

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:40.488
I should've left when
I had the chance.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:41.956
- We must try and fix it.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.557
Patricia, quick, light the way.

01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:50.531
(ominous music)

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.337
(groaning)

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.274
- Oh, it's the pain.
- Yes, yes, we know.

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:05.246
He's playing games with us.

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:07.982
(laughing)
- Victor, you bastard!

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:12.186
Show your face, you coward!
- He's here, I can feel him.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.355
- You shall not
have her, Victor,

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.090
your time is running out!

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:17.925
No!

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:21.862
- Mary!
- Victor!

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:22.897
- Mary!

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:24.899
Mary!
- Victor!

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:26.467
- [Patricia] Mary!

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:28.920
- Leave her be, Victor!

01:18:28.921 --> 01:18:30.104
- You should've left
Patricia to me.

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:31.272
- No, you don't have the right!

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:33.774
- Be quiet!
- I will kill you.

01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:34.675
- Idle threats.

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:40.181
(gunshot)
(gasping)

01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:41.449
- That's not possible!

01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:42.717
- The eclipse.

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:44.752
Get out Susanna and leave us be.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:47.955
- No.

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:49.924
I can't let you do that, Victor.

01:18:49.926 --> 01:18:52.093
I will not let you hurt her!

01:18:52.095 --> 01:18:53.861
- There's nothing
you can do about it!

01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:56.964
- It's okay,
it's okay, just leave.

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:59.233
It's okay.
- No.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.886
I can't!

01:19:01.887 --> 01:19:04.538
- The eclipse is fading,
as is my patience.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.539
Get out!
- No!

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:11.078
(gunshot)
(gasping)

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.514
- [Patricia] Susanna.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:14.982
- Enough.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:17.451
It's time, Patricia.
- Please, no.

01:19:18.588 --> 01:19:22.056
- Accept your fate and I will
live again.

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:25.426
(thudding)

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:28.996
(air raid sirens wailing)

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.632
- [Patricia] Will it hurt?

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:33.534
- It can be quick.

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:36.670
(explosions booming)

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:42.076
(whispering)

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:50.417
- [Patricia] Then I
accept my fate.

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:53.053
- Good.

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:58.893
(explosions booming)

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:03.364
- No!

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:05.199
(intense music)

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:06.567
(yelling)

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:07.601
No!

01:20:07.603 --> 01:20:09.036
- [Victor] Stop!

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:13.340
- I accept my fate and I will
die but not by your hand!

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:14.875
And to hell with you!

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:16.043
- You don't know
what you're doing!

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:18.045
- I don't care!

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:20.281
(gunshot)

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:41.602
(somber music)

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:42.503
Susanna.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.844
Mary.
(knocking)

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:51.212
Susanna!

01:20:51.214 --> 01:20:52.413
Mary!

01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:54.748
(knocking)

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:57.751
Susanna, Mary!

01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:01.222
- They cannot hear you.

01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:03.390
- [Patricia] What?

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:05.860
- This is your purgatory.

01:21:05.862 --> 01:21:08.495
(somber music)

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:11.799
You've ruined everything.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:16.003
- [Patricia] Victor, Victor!

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:26.914
(crying)

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:29.650
(somber music)
