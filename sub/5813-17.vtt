WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:04.596
Werewolf?

00:04.755 --> 00:06.849
- Their organs was ripped clean out.
- Hearts consumed.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.476
- Everyone here is a wolf?
- We don't use the "W" word around here.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.523
Break some hearts,
then you eat them.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.014
- Lucifer.
- Bloody hell.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.437
Donning this Cass mask...

00:17.100 --> 00:18.101
Hello, Dean.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.812
Just... Ugh.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.442
Dean, we'll get him back.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.527
We're gonna save Cass,
we're gonna ice the Devil

00:23.649 --> 00:25.447
and we're gonna shank The Darkness.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.698
Damn right.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.952
Reapers.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.954
People are still dying. Souls to collect.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.122
We kill everyone whose number's up.
I have a list.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.621
Death is nothing to fear.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.206
What? You got some kind of
death wish or something?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.625
You're the one who's always wanted
to go out Blaze of Glory style.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.290
- Why are you dead?
- Tessa, I need a favor.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.457
I couldn't live with you dead.

00:40.624 --> 00:41.716
It's your time to go, Dean.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.632
Now, if it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna save you.

00:43.794 --> 00:44.841
Name's Billie.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.971
The reaper Billie?
My brother says you want to kill us.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.302
Nah,

00:49.299 --> 00:50.979
I'm just gonna make sure
that when you die,

00:55.889 --> 00:56.890
you stay dead.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.109
How's it going over there?

02:33.737 --> 02:34.738
Same.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.081
Hmm.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
And you? Anything?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.247
Yeah, I think so.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.758
Yeah? Amara? Lucifer? Hand of God?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.255
No, no. It's a case.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.095
Werewolves, looks like. Um...

02:50.921 --> 02:53.344
A pattern of missing campers.
Five in the last three months.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.591
So they got lost.

02:54.758 --> 02:55.975
Well, that's what
the rangers thought, too.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.432
Until a couple days ago,
when they found a body.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.097
Let me guess. Minus a heart.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.941
Yeah. Now they're calling it
an animal attack, but...

03:03.141 --> 03:05.541
All right. Well, we'll make a call
and we put somebody on it.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.649
Yeah, but...

03:14.611 --> 03:15.612
We'll get him back.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.626
How?

03:24.621 --> 03:25.668
I don't know.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.710
But we'll figure it out.
Meantime, we gotta get out of here.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.303
Clear our heads. I mean, this is a case.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.798
Let's do what we do. Let's work it.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.393
Baby? You still with me?

03:42.889 --> 03:43.981
All right, all right...

03:44.558 --> 03:46.481
Hey, Dean, they...

03:46.810 --> 03:48.653
Okay, just hold tight, you two, okay?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.799
All right, listen,
we gotta get that bullet of there, okay?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.325
This is gonna hurt like hell.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.698
Here. Might need that.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.664
All right. Almost got it.
Almost got it. There.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.711
Come on.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.676
Okay, there we go!
There we go. Look at that, huh?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.888
Hey, you know what,
we're gonna keep that one.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.762
That one's gonna be a little memento.
We'll laugh about it some other time...

04:18.007 --> 04:19.567
- Guys? She ain't doing so good.
- Okay.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.265
- I got it. Go.
- You need this.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.851
The one he killed. He's got the key.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.186
Good. Okay.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.853
What were they?

04:30.353 --> 04:31.400
Werewolves.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.232
Told you they were monsters.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.535
That's right, baby. You called it.

04:36.693 --> 04:40.448
I thought werewolves needed
nighttime and a full moon.

04:42.073 --> 04:46.044
We've been here for days.
These guys, they can change any time.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.333
Yeah, it's 'cause
they were probably purebloods.

04:49.539 --> 04:53.089
And they can change anytime.
Anytime they want.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.382
Those wrists, those wrists are infected.
We gotta get something on them, okay?

04:58.548 --> 04:59.595
Okay.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.969
- How're we doing? How're we doing?
-  Yeah.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.762
- You good? You good?
- Yeah.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.271
All right, keep pressure on it.
Keep pressure.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.233
Here you go. Put those on.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.231
Is there a landline in here?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.768
You don't have a cell phone?

05:16.399 --> 05:17.616
There's no service for miles.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.904
I had a signal back at the car
a couple miles back.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.124
Okay, listen to me.
I'm gonna go for a signal, okay?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.418
We're gonna get you to a real doctor.
You're gonna be just fine.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.120
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Okay.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.423
You and me, hitching to national parks.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.417
Best honeymoon ever, right?

05:33.917 --> 05:36.591
Are you okay? I thought, yesterday...

05:36.920 --> 05:38.263
Just a couple scratches.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.652
- Hey, we're coming.
- No, no, no, no.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.201
No. We can't stay here.
Not with the others still out there.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.932
"The others"?

05:45.136 --> 05:47.764
Okay. Listen, my brother's been shot.
He can't stay here alone.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.316
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.816
- Sam, Hey.
- Iâ€™m fine.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.610
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Here, I got you.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.933
Okay, all right.
Okay, I guess we're going. Let's go.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.197
Everybody's going-

05:59.442 --> 06:01.615
You know, I used to be good
with faces, but,

06:02.445 --> 06:05.045
it's my age, and the number of folks
that come through this place,

06:05.198 --> 06:06.450
I seem to have lost the knack.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.462
So, these days everybody under 40
looks the same to me. I'm sorry.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.050
All right.
Look, we know we're in the right place.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.640
We've tried all the big landmarks
outside of the park.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.471
The police station, the fleabag motel
we're staying in, this bar...

06:26.636 --> 06:28.809
Yeah, well, we're running out of things
to interrogate.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.414
Unless you want to go outside
and start talking to the trees.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.649
Right.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.149
- All right. Let's call it a night.
- Right.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.738
Grab the check.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.782
You know, we can go to Park Services
in the morning, talk to the rangers.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.732
You know what I was thinking?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.751
You boys should check out
one of the easement cabins.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.514
It's private property within the park.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.380
It's just held onto for tax purposes,

06:54.581 --> 06:57.881
so, campers stumble on them
and they can hole up in there for weeks.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.721
Some of your missing could be
in one of them.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.218
Do you mind, urn, showing us
about where they are?

07:05.675 --> 07:06.847
Oh, yeah, sure.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.557
Right about there.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.232
Well, that is a big help.
That's great, thank you.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.646
No problem.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.022
Thanks.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.458
Careful.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.586
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.834
All right, the sun's gonna be up
pretty soon.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.723
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.138
Okay.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.185
I told you
that roadhouse chili was a bad idea.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.732
- Yeah.
- Guys!

07:55.433 --> 07:56.480
Over here.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.609
Hey, look at that.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.449
Okay.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.160
Here, see if you can find a radio
or a phone.

08:15.912 --> 08:16.959
Anything?

08:18.915 --> 08:19.962
No, it's dead.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.061
I got matches over here.
I'm gonna light those up.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.281
- Okay?
- Yeah.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.334
Hey.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.377
Hey! We gotta keep moving!

09:02.834 --> 09:04.632
Those of us who... Who can.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.344
What did you say?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.971
Look, hey, Michelle's real sick
but she's got a chance.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.304
Him? He's slowing us down,
and if they find us...

09:13.511 --> 09:15.809
We saved you, okay?
We saved both of you.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.593
It's three lives versus one.

09:17.849 --> 09:18.896
Hey! Whoa! Hey!

09:19.059 --> 09:21.733
Dean, stop! Dean, he's right.

09:23.605 --> 09:27.485
You guys need to go. Move. Go find help.
Come back for me.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.490
No, Sam! No.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.914
I'm gonna go outside. I'm gonna find
some wood and build you a litter,

09:32.989 --> 09:34.366
we're going to carry him
the rest of the way.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.124
It's only a couple of miles.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.272
I thought we trained you boys up right.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.521
I warned you they were coming,

10:04.729 --> 10:07.528
all but served them up to you
on a platter.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.656
Now what?

10:12.529 --> 10:14.748
Well, we're burned here.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.544
So clean up their mess,
and we'll get gone.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.724
Get off me!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.353
Okay. Okay. Okay.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.861
Guys. Guys.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.029
Go find Dean.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.616
Get out of here.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.248
Hey, please.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.921
Go. You gotta go.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.463
He won't leave you...

11:15.049 --> 11:17.347
And we won't last out there without him.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.643
Wait. What?

11:53.463 --> 11:54.510
I'm sorry.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.745
What?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.002
Is... Is he...

12:26.120 --> 12:27.212
Dead.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.526
We gotta go.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.355
Sam?

12:52.855 --> 12:53.902
Sammy!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.374
- What happened?
- I don't know. He just went.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.751
Sammy?

13:14.711 --> 13:15.758
Sam.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.009
No, no, no.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.057
It's them.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.026
Let them come.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.816
No, what?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.528
- He wants to stay.
- No, you can't!

13:36.733 --> 13:39.657
Hey, hey, hey. You stay, you fight,
you die and so do we.

13:39.861 --> 13:40.908
Look.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.573
He's gone.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.461
I'm sorry, but he's gone.

13:50.872 --> 13:51.919
Help us.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.421
Please.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.900
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.107
I promise.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.616
Okay.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.781
Okay. Let's go.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.435
Damn it!

14:55.561 --> 14:58.314
All right.
So, I think if we head in that way,

14:58.523 --> 15:01.026
should be about a four-mile trek
to the cabin.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.455
You know, we always talk about
taking a break, going camping.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.498
This could be like camping.
It could be fun.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.037
Yeah, which part? Hmm?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.720
Freezing our nuts off in the middle of
the woods on a thin lead?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.293
Yeah, that part.

15:14.789 --> 15:15.836
Oh, come on.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.762
Okay. Yeah.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.678
Hey, what happened back there?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.399
Talk to me.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.865
I saved us.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.039
Look, you're hurt bad, and...

15:50.199 --> 15:51.576
I love you, Michelle.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.870
I can't lose you.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.416
I did what I had to do.

16:03.713 --> 16:04.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:05.131 --> 16:07.179
Hey! Hey! Wait!

16:10.761 --> 16:13.139
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Right here! Right here!

16:14.515 --> 16:16.392
All right. Come on, guys.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.395
Okay, here we go.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.570
Jeez.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.735
- Now, come on. Let's get into the car.
- What'd you all get into?

16:25.943 --> 16:27.115
She needs medical attention
right away, okay...

16:27.278 --> 16:28.325
Hey, hold up!

16:28.488 --> 16:29.728
No, no. Just take care of them.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.077
I gotta get back to my car
and back to my brother.

16:31.282 --> 16:34.957
Hey, first, everyone is gonna settle down
and tell me what the hell is going on.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.401
Officer, I don't have the time.

16:36.871 --> 16:37.963
Hey! Hey. hey!

16:38.414 --> 16:39.461
You'll make time.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.519
Don't try to move
if you can help it.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.939
You've got a couple broken ribs
I haven't tended to yet.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.361
That, what is probably

17:01.854 --> 17:03.356
a nasty concussion.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.204
Hey! Do us both a favor. Get some rest.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.285
Then his brother...

17:18.579 --> 17:19.922
His brother just died.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.415
And we ran.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.461
The bad guys,

17:26.127 --> 17:28.472
- they're still out there.
- The monsters.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.722
- Werewolves.
- We don't know what their deal was.

17:32.635 --> 17:33.715
Only what that guy told us.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.774
"That guy" saved us,
and so did his brother.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.657
Thank you for your time.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.241
Your wife's been through a lot.

17:51.696 --> 17:55.075
I'll give a call to the rangers, have them
check out the cabin and the station.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.206
And then I'll let you know what they find.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.502
Okay.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.672
Michelle.

18:07.878 --> 18:08.970
We made it.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.726
Okay. Your wife is stable now.
Time for me to get a look at you.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.520
- I'm fine.
- Iâ€™ll be the judge.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.693
No, really, I'm good.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.908
Have a seat on the bed.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.846
What did this?

18:59.221 --> 19:00.268
How do you feel?

19:01.057 --> 19:02.149
I feel...

19:04.435 --> 19:05.561
Good.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.993
Come on, Charlie. Pick up.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.126
Come on.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.775
Hi.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.023
Hey.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.110
Can I?

19:51.774 --> 19:52.821
Sure.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.158
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.457
And to tell you...

20:17.842 --> 20:18.889
I'm sorry.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.439
You saved our lives and...

20:30.604 --> 20:32.197
Well, my mom used to say, um...

20:33.232 --> 20:36.156
I didn't believe her then,
but I think I do now.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.784
She used to say,

20:41.282 --> 20:42.329
"Death,

20:43.492 --> 20:44.914
"it's not the end."

20:57.548 --> 20:58.595
Dean.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.010
- I, uh...
- What are you doing?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.348
I need to...

21:02.428 --> 21:03.554
I need to talk to a...

21:04.096 --> 21:08.567
Well, I wouldn't call her a friend.
More like a scary, crazy, death machine.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.356
Werewolves aren't the only monsters
out there.

21:18.235 --> 21:22.240
How exactly do you talk
to an evil, scary, death machine?

21:23.699 --> 21:24.825
Easy.

21:26.827 --> 21:27.999
I die.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.376
What?

21:29.580 --> 21:30.627
Look, if you don't...

21:31.540 --> 21:33.713
If you want to leave, I get it.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.545
But if you want to help me,

21:36.754 --> 21:40.258
I'm looking for pretty much anything
with "barbital" in the name.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.350
This will work?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.601
It has to.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.451
Okay.

22:50.035 --> 22:54.211
After I do this,
go get the doc and tell her to, uh...

22:56.750 --> 22:59.344
Tell her to bring me back if she can.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.675
If not, no hard feelings, okay?

23:04.425 --> 23:06.848
- You don't have to do this.
- Yeah, I do.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.927
Dean?

24:22.503 --> 24:23.550
Go around that side.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.014
How do you feel?

24:40.854 --> 24:41.946
Dean?

25:00.374 --> 25:01.796
Dean!

25:04.753 --> 25:05.800
Dean?

25:34.491 --> 25:35.959
It's in here!

25:38.662 --> 25:39.709
What'd he take?

25:42.374 --> 25:43.421
Damn it! Uh...

25:43.834 --> 25:44.926
Grab me naloxone.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.674
It's the little bottle, middle shelf.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.847
And a bag of saline.
We need to run a line.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.230
Hold him down! Hold him!

25:57.431 --> 25:58.603
I'm trying!

27:36.196 --> 27:37.243
Help!

27:37.406 --> 27:38.453
- Holy hell.
- Help us.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.587
Come on, put me on my back.
It's easier to find a vein.

27:43.787 --> 27:44.834
Roll him over!

27:47.624 --> 27:48.967
I got him.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.270
Well, it took you long enough.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.230
Dean Winchester.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.683
What's with the freeze frame?

28:04.892 --> 28:07.941
Just savoring this.

28:09.688 --> 28:13.738
Though I have to say,
of all the ways I thought you'd go,

28:14.026 --> 28:16.654
heart attack, some fang,

28:16.945 --> 28:19.915
choking on a burger while binge-watching
Charles in Charge...

28:20.115 --> 28:21.833
Well, that was peak Baio.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.755
Point is, never took you
for the suicide type.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.545
Doesn't fit your whole martyr thing.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.970
So, what's up?

28:35.005 --> 28:36.131
We need to talk about Sam.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.138
- What about Sam?
- I need him back.

28:38.759 --> 28:39.806
"Back"?

28:39.968 --> 28:42.016
Stop playing. Look, you've got him,
I need him. Let's make a deal.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.268
Pass.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.477
Really? Just like that?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.187
Just like that.

28:48.352 --> 28:52.607
You know, The Darkness is out there,
and the world is gonna burn.

28:52.814 --> 28:57.570
And once she gets started, that's the end
of everything, including you.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.498
Sam's the only one who can stop it.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.746
Mmm.

29:04.618 --> 29:05.870
How's that?

29:10.374 --> 29:11.421
That's what I thought.

29:13.043 --> 29:16.673
It's cute, though, you pretending you're
trying to save Sam for the greater good,

29:16.880 --> 29:19.975
when we both know you're doing it for you.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.391
You can't lose him.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.691
But even if Sammy could win
the title bout,

29:29.851 --> 29:32.024
the answer would still be no.

29:33.063 --> 29:37.910
The answer will always be no.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.117
Game's over, Dean.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.748
No more second chances.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.622
No more extra lives.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.213
Time to say bye-bye to Luigi, Mario.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.466
I'm asking you.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.586
I'm begging you. Please.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.927
Bring him back.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.474
Bring him back, and take me instead.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.306
I'm not here to bargain with you, kid.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.107
I'm here to reap you.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.689
And the kicker is,

30:15.522 --> 30:17.240
Sam's not dead.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.736
But you are.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.951
Or will be, soon enough.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.329
Pulse is fading. Throw me that.
Cardio tray.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.585
- But how...
- Trust me.

30:32.789 --> 30:36.464
If the Big W bit it, I'd get a call.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.763
Come along now, Dean.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.306
It's time.

30:43.425 --> 30:44.472
Okay.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.980
The Empty, it's waiting.

30:51.641 --> 30:52.688
Okay.

30:56.897 --> 30:57.944
Turn him on his side.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.195
Okay.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.574
- He's alive.
- "He"?

32:30.782 --> 32:31.829
Sam?

32:32.409 --> 32:33.752
Oh, thank God.

32:34.244 --> 32:35.416
Yeah, not so much.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.206
I need a car.

32:37.414 --> 32:38.882
No. No, not a chance.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.379
Look, pal. I'm not asking.

32:40.584 --> 32:41.756
Hey, look, psycho.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.511
I got you for stealing and consuming
a felony's worth of schedule-four drugs,

32:46.715 --> 32:49.059
plus assaulting a police officer.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.306
You ain't going nowhere.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.602
Sedate him.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.808
No.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.400
Can we have a word outside, please?

33:11.781 --> 33:15.081
More drugs is the last thing he needs.
He could die.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.377
Again.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.339
Fine. Just keep your eye on him.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.319
I'm gonna call over to White Bird,
get some backup in here.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.268
Sammy?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.024
Dean. Yeah.

34:19.891 --> 34:20.983
on, God!

34:22.185 --> 34:23.652
I don't... What happened?

34:23.853 --> 34:24.945
Where are you?

34:25.146 --> 34:28.741
I'm, uh... The Urgent Care on 54.

34:31.695 --> 34:32.742
Sammy?

34:33.530 --> 34:35.248
Is Corbin with you?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.371
Sam!

34:37.617 --> 34:39.335
Dean!

35:17.866 --> 35:19.038
Hello?

35:22.495 --> 35:23.792
You Okay?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.403
I really am.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.587
Are you okay?

36:09.334 --> 36:10.381
What was that?

36:11.044 --> 36:12.284
- What happened?
- I don't know.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.310
Corbin.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.020
Hey, baby.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.770
Please, don't be scared of me.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.480
I didn't want this, okay?

36:30.689 --> 36:34.159
Any of this, but it's happened,
and it feels so...

36:36.778 --> 36:37.825
You'll see.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.911
- We'll be together.
- No.

36:41.825 --> 36:42.872
- Please.
- Forever.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.126
No.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.002
Run!

37:05.890 --> 37:07.688
No! No!

37:14.691 --> 37:16.659
It took you long enough.

37:36.629 --> 37:37.721
Hey.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.181
Hey.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.596
How you doing?

37:47.557 --> 37:49.309
How's your brother?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.730
Doc says that, uh...

37:54.939 --> 37:57.738
Well, when Corbin choked him,

37:59.694 --> 38:01.992
Sam's body went into shock.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.918
His breathing, his heartbeat slowed down
to almost nothing.

38:07.076 --> 38:10.080
So, he was, uh, just mostly dead.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.838
But he'll be okay.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.132
Must be nice.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.055
That wasn't...

38:28.264 --> 38:30.187
Corbin wasn't a killer.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.401
I know.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.688
He did it for me.

38:39.275 --> 38:44.873
Michelle, this is gonna be very hard,
but you will be okay.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.578
And eventually...

38:50.078 --> 38:52.297
Eventually you'll get back to normal.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.798
No, I won't.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.645
They said I could leave.

39:09.430 --> 39:10.807
An hour ago.

39:12.100 --> 39:15.821
But where am I even supposed to go?

39:19.274 --> 39:23.199
After everything we survived together,

39:25.989 --> 39:28.208
I watched the man I love die.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.671
There's no normal after that.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.256
Well, that's it, huh?

39:48.386 --> 39:51.185
Two quarts of O-neg and you're good to go.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.314
How is she?

39:55.518 --> 39:57.987
She's strong. She'll be all right.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.074
Those stitches gonna hold?

40:01.274 --> 40:03.151
Oh, yeah. Uh, professional grade.

40:04.235 --> 40:08.490
Couple days, antibiotics and some
bed rest, and I'm, uh, back to normal.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.541
Hey, so, what did you do?

40:19.208 --> 40:21.677
When you thought I was dead.
What did you do?

40:23.212 --> 40:24.634
Thought about redecorating your room,
you know.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.558
Putting in a Jacuzzi, a nice disco ball.
Really class up the joint.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.432
Right. Seriously.

40:29.636 --> 40:30.853
What? I, uh...

40:31.554 --> 40:33.306
I knew you weren't dead.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.522
Right.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.194
I knew.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.564
English - SDH
