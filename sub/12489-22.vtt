WEBVTT

00:07.138 --> 00:08.579
OH, I JUST LOVE
THESE PICNICS.
OUR NEIGHBORS

00:08.579 --> 00:12.143
COMING TOGETHER
TO SHARE IN COMMUNITY
AND FRIENDSHIP.

00:12.143 --> 00:15.416
THAT'S BARBARA MILSON.
SHE HAS A RASH NO ONE
CAN EXPLAIN.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.718
AND SPREAD
VICIOUS GOSSIP.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.121
I CAN'T WAIT FOR
THE STEWARTS
TO GET HERE.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.622
THEY'RE MY FAVORITE
COUPLE.
I KNOW,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.095
I LOVE OUR GAME NIGHTS.
WELL, NEXT TIME
LET'S PLAY...

00:24.095 --> 00:25.596
OH, AH!
SOUNDS LIKE...

00:25.596 --> 00:28.459
AHH, YOU'RE A ROBOT.
YOU'RE MARCHING,
IT'S A PARADE,

00:28.459 --> 00:29.660
CHARADES!

00:29.660 --> 00:31.202
( both laughing )

00:31.202 --> 00:32.633
OH, HEY,
THERE THEY ARE!

00:32.633 --> 00:35.436
THEY ARE THE TWO
COOLEST PARENTS HERE.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.508
NEXT TO US.

00:37.508 --> 00:39.770
Both:
SNAIL!

00:39.770 --> 00:41.172
HEY GUYS!
Mr. Stewart: HEY, THERE!

00:41.172 --> 00:42.413
HEY.
GOOD NEWS,

00:42.413 --> 00:44.315
I BROUGHT MY SPECIALTY :
MEATLOAF.

00:44.315 --> 00:45.576
All:
OHH!

00:45.576 --> 00:47.518
AND WHAT'D YOU BRING,
ELLEN?
MY SPECIALTY:

00:47.518 --> 00:48.819
PLATES AND CUPS.

00:48.819 --> 00:50.751
All:
OHH!

00:50.751 --> 00:53.684
HEY, LOOK.
CHLOE AND DARCY
SEEMED TO HAVE

00:53.684 --> 00:54.725
PATCHED THINGS UP.

00:54.725 --> 00:56.657
THAT'S GOOD.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.129
I WAS AFRAID IF THEY
STOPPED BEING FRIENDS
IT'D BE A LOT HARDER

00:58.129 --> 01:00.161
FOR US TO HANG OUT.
BUT LOOK,
THEY'RE HUGGING.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.062
I'M GOING TO POP
YOUR HEAD OFF!

01:02.062 --> 01:05.236
I WANT TO POP
YOUR HEAD OFF!

01:05.236 --> 01:06.797
Both:
HEY, B.F.F.!

01:06.797 --> 01:07.798
( both laughing )
OH!

01:07.798 --> 01:09.370
HEY, STAN.
AVERY,

01:09.370 --> 01:11.602
THEY HAVE A NEW
STUPID RULE FOR
THESE PICNICS.

01:11.602 --> 01:13.404
ALL DOGS GO IN THE PEN.

01:13.404 --> 01:15.576
MY LITTLE DOG'S
ALREADY IN THERE.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.610
OH, STAN WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS PICNIC.

01:19.610 --> 01:21.712
HUH?
I MEAN, AS MUCH
AS YOU COULD EVER

01:21.712 --> 01:23.784
KNOW WHAT A DOG
IS THINKING.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.217
STAN, I GUESS YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO GO
IN THE PEN.

01:26.217 --> 01:28.689
I CAN'T GO BACK IN THERE.
I JUST CAN'T!

01:28.689 --> 01:30.491
WAIT, I'VE NEVER
BEEN IN THERE.

01:31.662 --> 01:34.195
OH, THERE IT IS!
THERE'S THE MEATLOAF.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.697
OH, IT'S LIKE A PRECIOUS
LITTLE MEAT BABY.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.600
MINE!
NO, IT'S MINE!

01:39.600 --> 01:42.403
NO, IT'S MINE!
WHOA, OH, OH, OH!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

01:42.403 --> 01:45.536
LET GO, LET GO!
( arguing )

01:45.536 --> 01:48.679
Both:
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

01:48.679 --> 01:51.582
YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE FRIENDS.

01:51.582 --> 01:55.546
SHE TOOK MY NOSE!
AND I'M NOT
GIVING IT BACK!

01:55.546 --> 01:59.790
GIVE DARCY HER NOSE.
SHE KEEPS LICKING ME.

01:59.790 --> 02:02.553
STOP LICKING CHLOE.
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

02:02.553 --> 02:06.457
SHE DOESN'T TASTE
LIKE A STRAWBERRY,
SHE JUST LOOKS LIKE ONE.

02:06.457 --> 02:08.799
WHAT?

02:08.799 --> 02:11.732
YOU'RE DOING THIS?
YOU'RE ACTUALLY THROWING
ME IN THE CAN?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.465
I'M SO SORRY.
BRING YOU FOOD.

02:14.465 --> 02:17.538
DON'T BOTHER.
I'M GOING ON A HUNGER
STRIKE UNTIL I GET OUT.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.770
OH, COME ON,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN HERE FOR TWO HOURS.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.573
THEN BRING ME FOOD.

02:22.573 --> 02:24.445
JUST TRY TO
HAVE FUN WITH
THE OTHER DOGS, OKAY?

02:24.445 --> 02:26.577
OH, OKAY.
I'LL TRY.

02:26.577 --> 02:28.579
HEY GUYS.
HAVE YOU HEARD THIS ONE?

02:28.579 --> 02:29.720
KNOCK, KNOCK?

02:29.720 --> 02:32.483
( barking )

02:32.483 --> 02:37.358
NO, IT'S NOT A REAL DOOR.
IT'S A JOKE.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.330
Stan: I WASN'T ALLOWED
AT THE PICNIC,

02:39.330 --> 02:40.861
AND I DIDN'T FIT IN
WITH THE DOGS.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.594
MY SUBTLE WIT AND WORDPLAY
WERE LOST ON THEM.

02:43.594 --> 02:46.637
EVEN LINDSAY'S DOG.
SURE, SHE LOOKS SOPHISTICATED

02:46.637 --> 02:48.199
IN THAT HAT,
BUT I SAW HER

02:48.199 --> 02:50.571
EAT HALF A DIAPER.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.573
♪♪

03:10.321 --> 03:12.693
HEY. YOU, UH, READY TO
HELP ME OUT WITH CHLOE?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.525
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PLAN

03:14.525 --> 03:16.327
IS GONNA WORK.
YOU DON'T HAVE

03:16.327 --> 03:18.569
TO UNDERSTAND IT.
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.871
IT'S LIKE SCHOOL.

03:20.871 --> 03:21.872
HEY, GUYS.

03:21.872 --> 03:24.405
HEY, SWEETIE.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.336
HEY, THAT'S MY CEREAL.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.978
GET OVER IT, SALLY.

03:27.978 --> 03:29.440
I LEARNED THAT FROM AVERY.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.712
IT MEANS, YOU'RE MAKING
TOO BIG A DEAL.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.385
I GOT REAL PROBLEMS,
SALLY.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.987
IS IT THAT MOM AND DAD
ARE MAKING YOU

03:36.987 --> 03:38.449
BE FRIENDS WITH DARCY?

03:38.449 --> 03:39.950
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
YOU CAN DO.

03:39.950 --> 03:42.853
STEAL HER NOSE?
DID IT.

03:42.853 --> 03:45.296
NO. BREAK UP MOM
AND DAD'S FRIENDSHIP

03:45.296 --> 03:47.698
WITH DARCY'S PARENTS.
ONCE THEY SPLIT,

03:47.698 --> 03:48.999
YOU AND DARCY ARE DONE.

03:48.999 --> 03:51.532
I'M LISTENING.
AVERY TAUGHT ME THAT, TOO.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.734
IT MEANS,
I'M LISTENING, SALLY.

04:00.311 --> 04:01.712
( doorbell rings )

04:01.712 --> 04:02.713
I GOT IT.

04:02.713 --> 04:03.844
ARE YOU EXPECTING
ANYONE?

04:03.844 --> 04:06.347
WELL, AFTER YOUR
CARELESSNESS COST

04:06.347 --> 04:08.879
US A MEATLOAF,
I MENTIONED TO KELLY

04:08.879 --> 04:11.021
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE
THE FLU AND COULDN'T COOK.

04:11.021 --> 04:13.584
OH, GOOD THINKING!
IF IT'S HER,
I'LL LOOK FEVERISH

04:13.584 --> 04:15.656
AND WAN.
AND THEN GO SET
THE TABLE.

04:16.987 --> 04:18.258
HI.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.891
ARE YOU BENNETT JAMES?
YES, I AM.

04:20.891 --> 04:23.294
DID KELLY SEND YOU?
AH, NO.

04:23.294 --> 04:24.765
I'M DR. IAN CALLOWAY.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.797
OH, WELL,
I DON'T CARE, THEN.

04:26.797 --> 04:29.540
THIS IS
A LITTLE AWKWARD,
BUT I CAME HERE

04:29.540 --> 04:31.802
ALL THE WAY
FROM SPOKANE,
WASHINGTON.

04:31.802 --> 04:34.375
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU HAVE MY DOG.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.977
I'M STAN'S ORIGINAL OWNER.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.349
OH, MY GOSH.

04:38.349 --> 04:40.811
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!

04:42.383 --> 04:45.356
SO, NO MEATLOAF?

04:45.356 --> 04:47.358
STAN USED TO BE YOUR DOG?

04:47.358 --> 04:49.590
YES, HE RAN AWAY
WHEN HE WAS A PUPPY.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.423
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE HIM BACK.

04:52.423 --> 04:54.495
I JUST ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE LITTLE

04:54.495 --> 04:57.067
( makes honking noise )
GUY.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.430
SORRY, MY EARS GOT
CLOGGED ON THE PLANE.

04:59.430 --> 05:01.702
OH, HA, HA.
WELL, PLEASE,
COME IN.

05:01.702 --> 05:05.906
SO, UM, DR. CALLOWAY,
HOW DID YOU FIND US?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.739
OH, A FRIEND WHO READ
YOUR LATEST BOOK SAW
A PICTURE OF STAN

05:08.739 --> 05:10.310
AND YOUR FAMILY
ON THE BACK COVER.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.043
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
WHO READ MY BOOK?

05:13.043 --> 05:15.045
DID THEY LIKE IT?
YEAH.

05:15.045 --> 05:17.348
IS THE MEATLOAF HERE?

05:17.348 --> 05:18.749
WHO HIT THE DOORBELL?
UH--

05:18.749 --> 05:22.322
KIDS, THIS IS
DR. IAN CALLOWAY,
STAN'S ORIGINAL OWNER.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.554
WHAT?
NO, HE'S OURS!

05:23.554 --> 05:24.555
YOU CAN'T HAVE
OUR DOG!

05:24.555 --> 05:25.726
All:
OH!

05:25.726 --> 05:27.898
NO, NO, NO.
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

05:27.898 --> 05:29.099
HE LANDED IN
A GOOD HOME.

05:29.099 --> 05:31.662
OH. AH,
THEN NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.337
SORRY, DR. CALLOWAY,
WE GOT A LITTLE NERVOUS.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.039
ANY CHANCE I CAN SEE STAN?

05:39.039 --> 05:41.372
OH, I'M SURE
HE'D BE THRILLED.
STAN!

05:42.813 --> 05:44.575
Stan:
DR. IAN CALLOWAY.

05:44.575 --> 05:46.046
AHHHH!

05:47.347 --> 05:49.049
I WONDER WHERE STAN IS?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.581
OH, UH, WE'LL GO LOOK.
COME ON.

05:50.581 --> 05:53.384
THAT'S GREAT.
I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO SAYING--

05:53.384 --> 05:56.126
( makes honking noise )
HI TO HIM.

05:56.126 --> 05:57.958
HIS EARS ARE CLOGGED.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.492
MY EARS ARE CLOGGED.
( makes honking noise )

06:01.492 --> 06:03.564
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
I JUST WANTED TO DO THAT.

06:07.097 --> 06:09.369
STAN!

06:11.672 --> 06:13.844
( whimpering )

06:13.844 --> 06:16.877
STAN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THE CLOSET?
YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.409
DON'T MAKE ME
GO DOWN THERE.

06:18.409 --> 06:20.481
HE'S ONE OF
THE SCIENTISTS WHO
DID EXPERIMENTS ON ME

06:20.481 --> 06:22.382
WHEN HE FOUND OUT
I COULD TALK.

06:23.514 --> 06:25.856
WAIT!
STAN, COME HERE.
( whining )

06:27.718 --> 06:29.690
HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.392
I WAS A PUPPY.
IAN BECAME OBSESSED.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.825
I WAS HIS GUINEA PIG.
HIS LAB RAT.

06:34.825 --> 06:36.827
BUT, YOU KNOW,
STILL A DOG.

06:39.129 --> 06:42.172
I KNOW YOU CAN TALK.
SAY SOMETHING,
SO I CAN ANALYZE

06:42.172 --> 06:43.704
YOU'RE SYNAPTIC
VOCAL CODING,

06:43.704 --> 06:46.607
MAKE OTHER DOGS TALK,
AND AMASS A FORTUNE.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.578
HELP!

06:47.578 --> 06:48.839
SAY SOMETHING!

06:48.839 --> 06:51.582
OH, WAIT!
I MISSED IT,
LET ME TURN IT ON.

06:51.582 --> 06:52.813
THEN YOU CAN TALK AGAIN.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.986
NEVER!
WAIT 'TIL
I TURN IT ON.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.449
OKAY, GO!

07:02.052 --> 07:04.725
FINE.
DON'T COOPERATE.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.997
I CAN STAY
HERE ALL DAY.

07:06.997 --> 07:09.530
UNTIL SEVEN.
I HAVE THEATER TICKETS.

07:10.861 --> 07:13.564
( whispering )
But I'll be back
by 11.

07:16.006 --> 07:19.069
11:15 if there's traffic.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.773
HE'S OBVIOUSLY COME
BACK FOR ME BECAUSE
HE WAS NEVER ABLE

07:22.773 --> 07:24.575
TO FINISH
HIS EXPERIMENTS!

07:24.575 --> 07:27.748
DON'T WORRY, STAN,
WE'LL GET RID OF HIM.
DON'T BE SCARED.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.079
TOO LATE.
WHILE I WAS IN
YOUR CLOSET,

07:29.079 --> 07:30.180
I WET MY PANTS.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.752
YOU DON'T WEAR PANTS.
ALL RIGHT,

07:31.752 --> 07:34.224
FULL DISCLOSURE.
I WET YOUR PANTS.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.864
STAN'S IN MY SISTER'S ROOM.
HE'S NOT FEELING WELL.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.666
I CAN'T GET HIM DOWNSTAIRS.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.037
OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

07:47.037 --> 07:49.169
BUT I'M NOT FLYING
HOME FOR A FEW DAYS.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.041
LONGER IF MY
( makes honking noise )

07:51.041 --> 07:53.173
BAGS AREN'T FOUND
BY THE AIRLINE.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.906
CALL ME IF HE PERKS UP.

07:56.907 --> 07:58.709
YEAH.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.150
OH!

08:00.150 --> 08:02.252
Ellen and
Bennett:
THE MEAT BABY!

08:02.252 --> 08:05.115
Both:
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.260
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
MY TURN, MY TURN.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.792
LET'S SEE IT.
AH!

08:11.792 --> 08:13.864
THIS IS GONNA BE EASY.
MOVIE!

08:13.864 --> 08:15.495
JUST WAIT.

08:18.869 --> 08:20.771
STOMACH!
SHIRT! SHIRT!

08:20.771 --> 08:21.972
Ellen:
TIGHT SHIRT!
UH, UH...

08:21.972 --> 08:24.134
TURQUOISE!
ALLERGIES!
FREAKISH BELLY BUTTON!

08:25.235 --> 08:27.778
FORGET IT!

08:27.778 --> 08:29.780
IT WAS AUTHOR.

08:29.780 --> 08:30.941
OH, WE NEVER WOULD
HAVE GOTTEN THAT.

08:32.983 --> 08:35.646
SO, NOT TO BE RUDE,
BUT, UH,

08:35.646 --> 08:37.287
WHAT'S THE
STORY WITH...
OH.

08:37.287 --> 08:40.851
IT'S AN OUTTIE
THAT HAS TWO
LITTLE LIPS.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.995
AAH, I MEANT BRUNCH.

08:44.995 --> 08:46.997
WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH BRUNCH?

08:46.997 --> 08:48.659
IS IT READY YET?

08:50.901 --> 08:52.933
OKAY, GIRLS,
SHOWTIME.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.304
GET THE PARENTS
FIGHTING,

08:54.304 --> 08:55.936
THEY'LL STOP
BEING FRIENDS,
AND YOU'LL

08:55.936 --> 08:57.608
NEVER HAVE TO SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

08:57.608 --> 08:59.039
HOW DO WE GET
THEM FIGHTING?

08:59.039 --> 09:02.943
TELL THEM DARCY WOULDN'T LET
YOU PLAY WITH HER VOMITUS DOLL.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.746
IT'S NOT VOMITUS!
YOU'RE VOMITUS!

09:07.017 --> 09:09.219
SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO GET
PEOPLE FIGHTING?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.082
YOU READY, SNOT MONSTER?

09:12.082 --> 09:13.754
GOT IT,
MONKEY FACE.

09:13.754 --> 09:14.755
PERFECT.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.757
THANKS, EYEBROWS.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.989
SORRY, GOT
CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT.

09:20.591 --> 09:22.262
YOU THINK
MY BELLY BUTTON
IS FREAKISH,

09:22.262 --> 09:23.594
YOU SHOULD SEE
MY SISTER'S.

09:23.594 --> 09:26.296
IT'S LIKE MINE,
BUT WITH HAIR.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.199
Both:
WOW.

09:29.199 --> 09:30.901
YEAH, THE WHOLE FAMILY.

09:32.202 --> 09:33.573
( girls arguing
in the distance )

09:33.573 --> 09:34.975
THERE'S SOMETHING...

09:34.975 --> 09:36.607
OH, NO...

09:36.607 --> 09:38.278
( arguing and yelling )

09:38.278 --> 09:40.951
WHOA, STOP,
STOP, STOP.

09:40.951 --> 09:42.052
HEY, HEY, HEY!

09:42.052 --> 09:43.283
STOP!

09:43.283 --> 09:45.986
DARCY WON'T LET ME PLAY
WITH HER VOMITUS DOLL!

09:45.986 --> 09:50.260
IT'S NOT VOMITUS!
YOU'RE VOMITUS!

09:50.260 --> 09:52.022
( arguing )

09:52.022 --> 09:54.865
HEY, DARCY,
DO NOT CALL
CHLOE VOMITUS!

09:54.865 --> 09:56.867
YOUR DAUGHTER
SAID IT FIRST.

09:56.867 --> 09:58.929
YEAH, BUT YOUR DAUGHTER
SAID IT MEAN.

09:58.929 --> 10:01.201
OUR DAUGHTER MADE IT CUTE.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.134
RIDICULOUS!
REALLY, IF YOU
FEEL THAT WAY,

10:04.134 --> 10:06.606
WE'RE LEAVING!
THEN FORGET
GAME NIGHT!

10:06.606 --> 10:08.939
OH, FINE! WE'VE
BEEN PLAYING WITH
THE PETERSONS, ANYWAY.

10:08.939 --> 10:11.281
AND THEY DON'T EAT
MY MEATLOAF
ON PAPER PLATES.

10:11.281 --> 10:12.783
THEY USE PLASTIC!

10:12.783 --> 10:14.845
HOW UNSUSTAINABLE!

10:14.845 --> 10:17.087
LIKE OUR FRIENDSHIP.

10:17.087 --> 10:18.919
WE DID IT!
WE'RE NEVER GOING

10:18.919 --> 10:21.051
TO HAVE TO PLAY
TOGETHER AGAIN.

10:21.051 --> 10:22.853
DARCY!
WE'RE LEAVING!

10:22.853 --> 10:25.355
UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS THE LAST TIME

10:25.355 --> 10:27.798
WE STEP FOOT IN
THIS HOUSE AGAIN.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.629
SO, I KNOW THE KIDS
WANT TO BREAK US UP

10:29.629 --> 10:31.131
SO THEY DON'T HAVE
TO PLAY TOGETHER,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.303
BUT, I STILL DON'T GET
HOW THAT'S GOING TO MAKE
THEM FRIENDS AGAIN.

10:33.303 --> 10:36.006
THEY'RE BONDING OVER
DESTROYING US.

10:36.006 --> 10:37.207
THEY'LL HAVE SO MUCH FUN,
THEY'LL WANT TO DO

10:37.207 --> 10:38.368
MORE STUFF TOGETHER.
OH!

10:38.368 --> 10:39.970
HEY...

10:39.970 --> 10:41.942
DID YOU GUYS REALLY
HANG OUT WITH
THE PETERSONS?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.344
IT WAS JUST ONE NIGHT.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.276
WE THOUGHT OF YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.722
OH, YOU WANT IT, STAN?
YOU WANT IT?

10:51.722 --> 10:53.023
ALL RIGHT,
GO GET IT.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.057
TYLER, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.388
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
THAT WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP STAN

10:58.388 --> 11:01.331
OUT OF SIGHT UNTIL
WE KNOW THAT THAT
IAN GUY IS GONE.

11:01.331 --> 11:03.964
CALM DOWN.
IAN IS LONG GONE.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.666
THERE'S NOBODY IN
THE PARK EXCEPT US,
AND THAT DUDE

11:06.666 --> 11:08.769
WALKING OVER
TO STAN.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.870
THAT'S IAN!

11:11.271 --> 11:13.403
HEY! YOU GET AWAY
FROM HIM!

11:13.403 --> 11:17.047
OH! I ASSURE YOU,
I JUST CAME TO SEE
HOW HE'S DOING.

11:17.047 --> 11:19.109
HE ASKED IF I STILL TALK.

11:19.109 --> 11:21.912
WELL, I DON'T.

11:21.912 --> 11:24.384
HE TOLD US HOW BADLY
YOU TREATED HIM.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.686
WAY TO BLOW MY COVER.
I JUST CONVINCED HIM

11:26.686 --> 11:28.859
I COULDN'T TALK.

11:28.859 --> 11:30.891
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN SAYING?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.794
SURE, I'M A SCIENTIST
WHO IS CURIOUS ABOUT
HIS GIFT,

11:33.794 --> 11:35.996
BUT I NEVER HARMED HIM.

11:35.996 --> 11:40.030
STAN,
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

11:40.030 --> 11:42.202
YOU'RE AN AMAZING
LITTLE FELLA.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.474
AND I'M GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP YOU.

11:44.474 --> 11:46.276
HELP?

11:46.276 --> 11:49.910
TOGETHER, WE CAN
FIND OUT WHAT
MAKES YOU TALK.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.012
AND MAYBE TEACH
OTHER DOGS.

11:52.012 --> 11:55.285
THEN, YOU'LL NEVER
BE LONELY AGAIN.

11:55.285 --> 11:57.187
NEVER.

11:57.187 --> 12:00.290
OH, I'D DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU, LITTLE BUDDY.

12:00.290 --> 12:03.253
OH, HEY. YOU WANT
TO GO TO THE THEATER TONIGHT?

12:03.253 --> 12:05.395
IT'S WHO'S AFRAID
OF VIRGINIA WOOLF.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.157
( whining )

12:08.258 --> 12:11.832
DON'T BE AFRAID.
IT'S NOT A REAL WOLF.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.034
IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL
VIRGINIA WOOLF.

12:15.906 --> 12:19.069
WOW, THAT DOES
SOUND FAMILIAR.

12:19.069 --> 12:21.241
MAYBE I HAD
EVERYTHING ALL WRONG.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.914
I'M NOT WHO YOU
THINK I AM.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.846
I ALWAYS TOOK
GOOD CARE OF YOU.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.319
BUT, I NEVER REALIZED
HOW SCARY MY--
( coughs )

12:29.319 --> 12:31.982
EQUIPMENT MUST
HAVE LOOKED TO
A LITTLE PUPPY.

12:31.982 --> 12:34.424
I CAN NOT BELIEVE
MY EARS HAVEN'T
POPPED YET.

12:34.424 --> 12:37.988
SO, YOU'RE REALLY
JUST HERE TO SEE
HOW HE IS?

12:37.988 --> 12:42.492
YES. AND, I HAVE
SOME EXCITING NEWS.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.396
I FOUND YOUR FAMILY,
BUDDY.

12:46.396 --> 12:49.469
MY...WHAT?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.001
Ian: TWO BROTHERS
AND A SISTER.

12:51.001 --> 12:54.044
AND ALL THEY CAN
TALK ABOUT IS WANTING
TO MEET YOU.

12:54.044 --> 12:55.846
THEY TALK?

12:55.846 --> 12:58.849
WAIT A MINUTE.
WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE YOU?

12:58.849 --> 13:01.982
THAT'S UP TO YOU.
I'M JUST OFFERING
STAN A CHANCE

13:01.982 --> 13:03.954
TO MEET HIS
TALKING BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

13:03.954 --> 13:06.356
IF HE'S
NOT INTERESTED,
NO PROBLEM.

13:06.356 --> 13:09.389
Ian: THERE'S NOTHING
IN THIS FOR ME.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.823
STAN.
I KNOW YOU'RE VERY
HAPPY HERE,

13:12.823 --> 13:14.224
BUT IF YOU'D LIKE
TO MEET YOUR FAMILY,

13:14.224 --> 13:16.997
I'D BE GLAD
TO TAKE YOU BACK.

13:31.081 --> 13:32.512
( sighs )

13:36.286 --> 13:37.517
( sighs )

13:37.517 --> 13:38.949
I CAN'T SLEEP.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.590
ME, EITHER.

13:47.257 --> 13:48.999
STAN, ARE YOU
REALLY THINKING
ABOUT GOING

13:48.999 --> 13:50.600
TO SPOKANE
WITH IAN
TOMORROW?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.132
NO...

13:52.132 --> 13:55.235
YES...
I--I DON'T KNOW...
( sighing )

13:55.235 --> 13:56.236
( sighing )

13:56.236 --> 13:57.337
I MEAN,
I LOVE IT HERE...

13:57.337 --> 13:59.339
BUT I DON'T FIT IN
WITH DOGS.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.041
AND I DON'T FIT IN
WITH HUMANS.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.944
IMAGINE IF YOU WERE
THIS WEIRD HAIRY
CREATURE THAT COULDN'T

14:03.944 --> 14:06.116
COMMUNICATE WITH
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

14:06.116 --> 14:08.848
SUDDENLY I FEEL BAD
FOR TYLER.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.882
I'M SERIOUS, AVERY.

14:11.882 --> 14:13.583
WAIT, STAN.
IS THIS ABOUT
BEING PUT IN

14:13.583 --> 14:15.255
THE PEN AT THE PICNIC?

14:15.255 --> 14:18.858
DON'T BASE THIS HUGE
DECISION ON ONE
FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.591
I'M NOT.
I'VE BEEN FEELING
THIS WAY A LOT.

14:21.591 --> 14:24.434
IT'S WHY I WANTED
TO BE LIKE A PERSON
AND DRIVE THE CAR

14:24.434 --> 14:27.067
THAT TIME.
AND WHY I WAS
PSYCHED TO MAKE

14:27.067 --> 14:29.539
A FRIEND PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES ONLINE
WITH SOMEONE

14:29.539 --> 14:31.902
WHO DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW I WAS A DOG.

14:31.902 --> 14:33.944
AND THAT ONE TIME
I PUT ON YOUR FATHER'S
SUIT AND TOOK OUT

14:33.944 --> 14:35.875
A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN.

14:38.308 --> 14:40.380
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
REALLY THINKING
ABOUT LEAVING.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.153
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY GAVE ME THE LOAN.

14:45.355 --> 14:47.617
STAN, WE'VE BEEN
EVERYTHING
TO EACH OTHER.

14:47.617 --> 14:50.921
IT'S JUST THAT
THIS WOULD BE
A CHANCE

14:50.921 --> 14:53.593
TO BE WITH OTHERS
LIKE ME.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.225
WITH MY REAL FAMILY.

14:55.225 --> 14:56.997
YOU HAVE
TO BE LIKE EACH
OTHER TO BE

14:56.997 --> 15:00.430
A REAL FAMILY.
LOOK AT US.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.572
TYLER'S A LUMBERING
GIANT.

15:02.572 --> 15:07.337
I'M A LITTLE PIXIE.
CHLOE'S A WALKING
STRAWBERRY.

15:07.337 --> 15:11.381
WE'RE NOTHING ALIKE,
BUT WE COULDN'T BE
A CLOSER FAMILY.

15:11.381 --> 15:14.684
AH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M JUST TIRED,
THAT'S ALL.

15:14.684 --> 15:17.517
GOOD.
'CAUSE I COULD
NEVER LOSE YOU.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.689
AND I COULD
NEVER LOSE YOU.

15:26.296 --> 15:27.497
( sighing )

15:27.497 --> 15:29.159
GOOD NIGHT.

15:29.159 --> 15:30.630
GOOD NIGHT.

15:43.974 --> 15:45.675
( door bell rings )

15:47.947 --> 15:49.949
HELLO.
HELLO.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.082
I CAME TO GIVE
CHLOE BACK HER TOYS.

15:52.082 --> 15:54.024
SHE'S OVER THERE.

15:55.385 --> 15:57.327
NOW, WE'LL SEE
IF MAKING THEM
WORK TOGETHER

15:57.327 --> 15:59.289
TO BREAK US UP
WILL BRING THEM
BACK TOGETHER.

15:59.289 --> 16:01.961
THIS IS
THE CRITICAL STAGE
OF THE PLAN.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.363
IN MY BOOK,
I CALL THIS,

16:03.363 --> 16:06.596
"THE CRITICAL STAGE
OF THE PLAN."

16:06.596 --> 16:09.499
HERE ARE THE TOYS
YOU LEFT AT MY HOUSE.

16:09.499 --> 16:11.271
I HAVE YOURS, TOO.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.677
HERE, TAKE YOUR
NOSE BACK.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.251
THANKS.
I REALLY MISSED IT.

16:21.251 --> 16:23.183
IT SNEEZED A COUPLE
OF TIMES WHILE
I HAD IT.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.684
MIGHT HAVE A COLD.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.056
( laughing )

16:26.056 --> 16:27.557
THAT'S FUNNY.

16:27.557 --> 16:29.419
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE GOT
OUR PARENTS SO MAD
AT EACH OTHER

16:29.419 --> 16:31.161
WE DON'T HAVE
TO PLAY ANYMORE?

16:31.161 --> 16:32.692
WE ARE GOOD.

16:34.164 --> 16:36.596
OHH!
OHH!

16:37.597 --> 16:40.370
OHH!

16:42.001 --> 16:43.773
( school bell rings )

16:45.575 --> 16:48.078
AVERY, THANKS FOR
THE ADVICE YESTERDAY.

16:48.078 --> 16:50.610
OH, NO BIGGIE.
I HAVE A LITTLE
MUSTACHE, TOO.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.642
IT'S JUST BLONDE
SO YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.486
SO, WHAT'S WRONG?

16:56.486 --> 16:58.488
YOU DIDN'T SHOUT
AT EVERY ANSWER,
OR CORRECT

16:58.488 --> 17:01.721
THE TEACHER ONCE.
YOU REALLY
KNOW ME, LINDSAY.

17:03.193 --> 17:05.525
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
SOMEONE THAT YOU
REALLY CARE ABOUT,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.257
AND THEY WANT
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

17:07.257 --> 17:09.129
BUT, GIVING IT
TO THEM...

17:09.129 --> 17:11.261
Both: HURTS YOU MORE
THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

17:11.261 --> 17:14.704
NO. BUT I'D IMAGINE
IT'D BE HORRIBLE.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.566
I'D LIE AWAKE
ALL NIGHT,
AND...

17:16.566 --> 17:18.668
Both: READ ALL MY EMILY
DICKINSON POEMS

17:18.668 --> 17:20.570
AND THREATEN TO
CUT MY HAIR!

17:20.570 --> 17:22.672
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING!

17:22.672 --> 17:24.474
I HAD A HUNCH.

17:24.474 --> 17:26.116
THANKS, LINDSAY.

17:26.116 --> 17:28.047
YOU KNOW,
IT HELPS JUST KNOWING
THAT YOU GET ME.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.281
I KNOW.
SOME PEOPLE CAN
NEVER FIND THAT.

17:31.281 --> 17:34.154
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW
LONELY THEY MUST BE?

17:34.154 --> 17:38.488
YEAH. YEAH.
I CAN.

17:42.392 --> 17:44.564
OH.
FYI, MR. GERWIN.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.766
THE CAPITAL KAZAKHSTAN
IS NOT AKMOLA,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.738
IT'S NOW ASTANA.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.407
STAN.
THIS IS THE HARDEST
THING I'VE EVER

17:57.407 --> 17:58.778
HAD TO SAY,
BUT...

17:58.778 --> 18:00.650
THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD
FOR YOU TO GO BACK

18:00.650 --> 18:02.081
TO WASHINGTON WITH IAN.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.253
IF THIS IS ABOUT
THE HAT,

18:03.253 --> 18:05.655
I THOUGHT
IT WAS TYLER'S.

18:05.655 --> 18:08.788
NO. STAN,
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE HAT.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.521
IN THAT CASE,
MAKES YOUR HEAD
LOOK LIKE A PEANUT.

18:11.521 --> 18:12.622
THERE I SAID IT.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.767
STAN, I'M SERIOUS.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.230
THIS IS A CHANCE
FOR YOU TO BE
WITH DOGS

18:20.230 --> 18:22.132
WHO UNDERSTAND YOU.

18:22.132 --> 18:24.434
WHO REALLY GET YOU.

18:24.434 --> 18:25.775
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.

18:25.775 --> 18:27.707
REALLY?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.410
THIS IS GONNA TEAR
MY HEART OUT,

18:30.410 --> 18:32.812
BUT I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.315
MY HAPPINESS MEANS
THAT MUCH TO YOU?

18:35.315 --> 18:37.887
OF COURSE IT DOES,
STAN.

18:37.887 --> 18:40.190
BUT I WOULDN'T BE
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

18:40.190 --> 18:43.493
YOUR HAPPINESS
WILL ALWAYS BE
IMPORTANT TO ME.

18:43.493 --> 18:45.295
NO MATTER WHERE
YOU ARE.

18:52.662 --> 18:54.664
( laughing )

18:55.805 --> 18:57.737
LOOKS LIKE THE PLAN
IS WORKING, DAD.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.540
WELL, SO FAR.
THANKS FOR PLANTING
THE IDEA IN HER HEAD.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.212
YOU DID GREAT.

19:02.212 --> 19:04.414
NOT MEATLOAF GREAT.

19:04.414 --> 19:07.317
LIGHTEN UP, SALLY.

19:07.317 --> 19:08.918
CHLOE TAUGHT ME THAT.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.923
HAS BENNETT EVER THOUGHT
OF HAVING IT REMOVED?

19:13.923 --> 19:17.357
HE DID.
KEEPS GROWING BACK.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.828
YOU KNOW,
IF WE WANNA BE
FRIENDS AGAIN,

19:18.828 --> 19:21.160
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE OUR PARENTS
LIKE EACH OTHER.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.563
I DON'T KNOW,
WE GOT 'EM PRETTY
MAD AT EACH OTHER.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.736
WILL YOU GUYS
BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

19:26.736 --> 19:27.897
SURE.
OKAY.

19:27.897 --> 19:31.170
WE CAN DO ANYTHING.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.603
Both: SNAIL!
( laughing )

19:37.907 --> 19:40.710
YOU SURE THIS
IS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO?

19:40.710 --> 19:42.812
WE ALL LOVE STAN
SO MUCH.

19:42.812 --> 19:46.456
WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE
WE ALL LOVE STAN SO MUCH.

19:46.456 --> 19:48.858
IF WE LOVE HIM LESS,
CAN WE KEEP HIM?

19:48.858 --> 19:49.959
Ian: STAN?

19:49.959 --> 19:51.891
ARE YOU READY?

19:51.891 --> 19:55.225
TYLER.
YOU'RE A ROCK STAR.

19:55.225 --> 19:57.227
I EXPECT GREAT THINGS
FROM YOU.

19:57.227 --> 19:58.428
GIRLS, WATCH OVER HIM.

19:58.428 --> 19:59.769
I DON'T THINK
HE'S GOING VERY FAR.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.933
CHLOE.
NEVER TURN OFF THAT

20:03.933 --> 20:06.576
CURLY RED DREAM FACTORY
OF YOURS, OKAY?

20:06.576 --> 20:09.279
OH, STAN.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.883
AND AVERY.

20:13.883 --> 20:15.785
YOU JUST STAY
WHO YOU ARE.

20:15.785 --> 20:18.618
YOU HAVE MORE
STRENGTH
AND GOODNESS

20:18.618 --> 20:20.320
THAN ANYONE I KNOW.

20:27.857 --> 20:30.700
ALL SET, BUDDY?

20:30.700 --> 20:32.602
LET'S JUST DO IT.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.965
BE HAPPY, STAN.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.609
WAIT.

20:39.609 --> 20:42.512
OH, COME ON, STAN.
THEY'LL GET OVER IT.

20:42.512 --> 20:43.673
THEY HAVE THE RED HEAD.

20:44.674 --> 20:46.676
I CAN'T DO THIS.

20:46.676 --> 20:49.279
BUT, STAN.
YOUR FAMILY IS WAITING

20:49.279 --> 20:50.620
FOR YOU IN SPOKANE.

20:50.620 --> 20:54.384
NO, NO, NO.
THESE GUYS
ARE MY FAMILY.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.786
THEY WERE GONNA LET ME GO
TO MAKE ME HAPPY,

20:56.786 --> 20:58.688
NO MATTER HOW SAD
IT MADE THEM.

20:58.688 --> 21:00.730
THAT'S REAL LOVE.

21:00.730 --> 21:02.362
I'M NOT GIVING THAT UP.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.963
STAN!

21:03.963 --> 21:05.034
YOU'RE THE BEST!

21:05.034 --> 21:06.696
WE COULD NEVER LOSE YOU.

21:06.696 --> 21:08.898
BUT, STAN.
YOU'LL LOVE SPOKANE.

21:08.898 --> 21:10.700
THERE ARE RIVERS
AND STREAMS,

21:10.700 --> 21:12.602
A BEAUTIFUL VIEW
OF PUGET SOUND,

21:12.602 --> 21:14.304
AND FABULOUS
REGIONAL THEATER.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.947
WAIT.
YOU CAN'T SEE PUGET SOUND

21:17.947 --> 21:19.849
FROM SPOKANE.
IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE

21:19.849 --> 21:22.352
OF THE STATE WITH
A MOUNTAIN RANGE IN BETWEEN.

21:22.352 --> 21:24.053
IT'S A PARTIAL VIEW.

21:24.053 --> 21:28.458
AND THE REGIONAL THEATER
IS MARGINAL AT BEST.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.790
YOU'RE LYING,
AREN'T YOU?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.822
ONLY ABOUT
LIVING IN SPOKANE.

21:32.822 --> 21:34.524
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT YOU FOLLOWING ME.

21:34.524 --> 21:36.826
STAN DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SIBLINGS, DOES HE?

21:36.826 --> 21:38.868
THERE ARE NO OTHER
TALKING DOGS.

21:38.868 --> 21:40.930
THERE WILL BE.
I AM THIS CLOSE
TO FIGURING OUT

21:40.930 --> 21:42.702
HOW DOGS TALK.
AND I NEED STAN
TO DO IT.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.775
THERE HE IS.
NOW THAT'S THE IAN I REMEMBER!

21:45.775 --> 21:46.776
GIVE ME THAT DOG!

21:46.776 --> 21:47.977
IAN STOP!

21:47.977 --> 21:50.640
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.
BUT I WILL TELL YOU

21:50.640 --> 21:52.812
THE SECRET OF HOW I CAN TALK.
COME HERE.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.844
CLOSER...

21:54.844 --> 21:56.546
( whispering )
Closer...

21:56.546 --> 21:58.388
Stan:
Closer...
OH!

21:58.388 --> 22:02.592
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M 1/8 BOXER.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.726
HEY, MY EARS CLEARED OUT.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.829
NOW YOU CLEAR OUT.
( growling )

22:09.829 --> 22:11.661
AND DON'T COME BACK!

22:11.661 --> 22:12.932
( laughing )

22:16.806 --> 22:18.738
Stan: THIS WHOLE THING
STARTED WITH IAN

22:18.738 --> 22:20.770
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE I BELONGED.

22:20.770 --> 22:24.674
THE TRUTH IS,
I BELONG EXACTLY WHERE I AM.

22:24.674 --> 22:27.817
I'D RATHER BE WITH THESE
THREE AMAZING KIDS

22:27.817 --> 22:31.581
IN THIS WONDERFUL FAMILY THAN
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.

22:31.581 --> 22:32.922
EXCEPT FOR AUSTRALIA.

22:32.922 --> 22:34.424
I'M DYING TO DRINK OUT
OF A TOILET

22:34.424 --> 22:36.686
THAT SWIRLS THE OTHER WAY.
