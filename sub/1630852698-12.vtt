WEBVTT

01:07.442 --> 01:08.777
Mommy…

01:57.283 --> 02:00.161
Your home isn't over there, is it?

02:02.163 --> 02:02.997
No.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.792
I think they're burning Hyosan down.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.544
Hey, Seoul University.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.878
Yes?

02:09.546 --> 02:11.172
To save the majority,

02:13.258 --> 02:15.510
just how heartless are you allowed to be?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.975
You must learn things like that
at your school.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.357
We don't learn
that kind of stuff in my major.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.901
I'm not sure what major does.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.243
Oh no…

03:29.500 --> 03:30.835
Stay still.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.529
Let's go.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.579
Let's go, On-jo.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.964
I can't just go like this.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.885
I'm sorry. Can you wait a bit?

04:22.470 --> 04:24.222
Oh, never mind.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.724
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.446
I'll go with her.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.948
Let's go together.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.366
I'll go too.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.702
No, you hurt your leg.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.246
Wu-jin, look after Dae-su.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.464
Cheong-san.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.638
Cheong-san!

05:57.565 --> 05:59.776
Cheong-san, you jerk!

06:16.000 --> 06:17.251
Let's go.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.923
I don't smell anything.
There's no one here.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.012
Let's say bye to Cheong-san…

06:31.724 --> 06:32.767
and leave.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.006
Slowly.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.134
Damn it.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.020
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

07:18.104 --> 07:21.524
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

07:30.491 --> 07:32.410
One infected eliminated.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.120
Pulling out.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.168
THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA

07:42.503 --> 07:44.547
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

07:49.010 --> 07:51.345
The soldiers saw us at school.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.141
They left us there without helping us.
Then they bombed it.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.395
Maybe they want us to die.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.523
That can't be it.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.737
I think it's because of me.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.075
Because we were with zombies,

08:14.785 --> 08:18.080
they must think we're neither
zombies nor humans, like me.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.543
Maybe that's what they thought.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.295
Don't say that.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.675
Is it okay for me
to stay with you guys like this?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.470
You're still our friend
and our classroom president.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.848
We couldn't have made it
this far without you.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.475
Still…

08:37.975 --> 08:40.019
You haven't turned,

08:41.521 --> 08:42.605
and you never will.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.075
Let's do that again later.

08:56.619 --> 09:00.164
It was my first time
sitting around a fire with friends.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.544
We'll be able to do that again, right?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.171
Let's do it tonight.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.717
What the hell?

09:11.801 --> 09:12.969
What's wrong?

09:13.052 --> 09:15.805
Shit. I think we're lost.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.975
-There's no trail?
-There hasn't been a trail for a while.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.394
I feel like we're going in circles.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.563
Why did you come this way
if there was no trail?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.273
We might end up back at Hyosan.

09:28.609 --> 09:29.986
Ha-ri.

09:30.069 --> 09:30.987
Look.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.992
There's something there.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.342
It was tied here.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.053
Who did something so nice?

09:56.887 --> 09:58.055
Maybe a ginseng digger?

09:59.390 --> 10:00.808
What's that?

10:06.188 --> 10:07.440
I see another one.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.810
RESCUE TEAM 1 NAM SO-JU

11:47.790 --> 11:48.833
What state are they in?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.502
It looks like
they're about to die of starvation.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.838
Transport them carefully.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.632
You must not lose or damage them.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.092
Yes, sir.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.947
Didn't he say we should go to Yangdong?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.867
Do you think the zombies are here too?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.618
No way.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.706
They probably evacuated the city
because it's next to Hyosan.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.418
Hey, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.836
Why are there no people?

12:37.548 --> 12:38.507
It's okay here.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.967
Why? What's okay?

12:40.760 --> 12:44.013
There are no broken windows,
and there's no blood on the streets.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.351
It wouldn't be this clean
if the zombies had been rampant.

12:52.938 --> 12:53.898
What is it?

12:54.523 --> 12:55.858
Hold on.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.128
What is it, Nam-ra?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.009
What is it? Is something here?

13:22.760 --> 13:23.677
Zombies.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.349
Where?

13:30.851 --> 13:31.727
Everywhere.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.729
Are there a lot of them?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.981
One, two, three…

13:39.068 --> 13:40.319
four, five, six…

13:43.948 --> 13:45.157
seven, eight…

13:47.868 --> 13:49.578
nine, ten, eleven…

13:56.502 --> 13:57.545
Run.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.298
Hey, this way.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.408
Damn it.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.290
-Are you okay?
-Take Dae-su and go.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.374
Forget it.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.878
What are you doing? I said go.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.254
I said forget it.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.427
On-jo.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.140
Fuck.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.726
I have a feeling it'll all end here.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.687
Stay behind me.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.815
Stop messing around. Stay back.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.087
Let go of me!

17:09.820 --> 17:10.988
Ha-ri!

17:16.577 --> 17:17.786
Fuck!

17:25.961 --> 17:26.920
Fuck!

17:27.004 --> 17:28.338
Get off of him!

17:28.422 --> 17:30.007
Get off! Hey!

17:43.395 --> 17:44.229
Wu-jin.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.315
-Fuck.
-Wu-jin.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.818
-Oh no.
-I fucking knew this would happen.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.488
It's okay.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.783
I knew it.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.994
-Wu-jin, look at me.
-Ha-ri.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.371
Did you really make the national team?

18:02.539 --> 18:04.041
Yes, I did.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.375
Bullshit.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.253
You came to school
because you got eliminated.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.423
Otherwise, you'd be at the tournament.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.717
If you got eliminated,

18:13.801 --> 18:16.678
you should've gone home.
Why did you come to school? Fuck.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.515
-I'm sorry.
-Listen.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.393
Stick with archery. Okay?

18:24.353 --> 18:25.437
Okay.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.688
Don't give up.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.359
-Okay?
-Okay.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.322
Wu-jin, I'm sorry.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.577
No. Not Wu-jin.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.913
Don't do it.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.748
Fuck.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.729
I'm sorry.

19:26.623 --> 19:27.499
Su-hyeok.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.751
Wu-jin…

19:30.377 --> 19:32.588
Wu-jin…

19:41.513 --> 19:44.975
More are coming.
Let's go that way. There aren't any there.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.188
Let's go, Dae-su.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.699
Ha-ri, let's go.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.034
Let go.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.546
Don't die a meaningless death.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.154
If we run now, we can all live.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.823
We have enough time.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.535
I've been killing zombies, too,

20:46.703 --> 20:50.540
but a human being would apologize
for killing her brother in front of her.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.578
Eat them.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.500
Eat them. Eat them all.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.549
Why not? You're hungry.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.595
Kill them.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.229
I'm hungry.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.114
Stop it.

22:46.073 --> 22:46.907
Wait.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.158
What is it?

22:49.159 --> 22:50.327
Nam-ra's gone.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.455
I'll be right back.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.165
-Su-hyeok!
-Hey, Su-hyeok.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.835
-Can you go on your own?
-What do you plan to do?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.004
-Go ahead. I'll catch up.
-On-jo.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.172
Hey, On-jo!

23:39.543 --> 23:40.502
Nam-ra.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.557
Why are you here by yourself?

23:55.058 --> 23:56.226
Let's go.

23:58.478 --> 23:59.479
Stay away.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.273
Come with us.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.860
-Okay?
-I said stay away!

24:18.623 --> 24:19.624
Nam-ra!

24:21.918 --> 24:24.671
Nam-ra. It's me, On-jo.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.006
Nam-ra, don't do this.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.716
Choi Nam-ra!

24:33.722 --> 24:35.015
Nam-ra, please.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.996
You can bite me.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.167
I'm okay.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.669
It's okay, Nam-ra.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.557
On-jo.

25:18.391 --> 25:19.559
Are you okay, On-jo?

25:20.143 --> 25:21.102
Are you okay?

25:23.980 --> 25:24.814
Nam-ra.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.026
Nam-ra.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.363
Hey, Prez!

25:47.671 --> 25:48.547
Nam-ra!

25:50.340 --> 25:51.424
Nam-ra!

25:55.095 --> 25:56.221
Hey, Choi Nam-ra!

25:58.390 --> 25:59.349
Nam-ra!

26:19.286 --> 26:20.161
Up ahead!

26:30.255 --> 26:31.298
Survivors confirmed.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.602
Go! Hurry!

26:46.646 --> 26:48.315
Let's go! Let's go home!

26:50.066 --> 26:51.443
Go!

26:52.068 --> 26:54.070
Go!

26:56.031 --> 26:57.073
Ha-ri!

27:02.787 --> 27:03.705
Hey!

27:05.248 --> 27:06.499
Come get me. All of you.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.754
Today, I am…

27:12.922 --> 27:15.342
the happiest guy in this school!

27:41.284 --> 27:42.369
On-jo.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.121
U-sin.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.584
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

27:52.712 --> 27:53.672
What about your dad?

27:54.839 --> 27:58.218
Did you meet your dad?
He went to find you.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.856
RESCUE TEAM 1 NAM SO-JU

28:17.862 --> 28:20.031
I already knew the sorrow

28:21.574 --> 28:22.742
of a survivor.

28:24.828 --> 28:29.249
But I didn't know how heavy
that sorrow would be…

28:31.376 --> 28:33.002
at that time.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.589
Do you know the teacher, Lee Byeong-chan?

28:38.133 --> 28:40.635
I only took morning classes
because I had training.

28:41.594 --> 28:42.971
So, no, I don't.

28:43.054 --> 28:46.766
Has he ever said anything weird
or acted strangely?

28:48.268 --> 28:50.520
That isn't important right now.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.398
I'm a senior. What about the CSAT?

28:55.316 --> 28:57.068
If there's anything you want to say,
say it.

29:01.531 --> 29:04.826
How many times do I have to tell you?

29:06.411 --> 29:10.498
He kidnapped a student
from our class named Hyeon-ju.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.334
I heard he gave Kim Hyeon-ju
some sort of injection.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.544
Why did you

29:16.171 --> 29:17.297
abandon us?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.178
You abandoned us.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.680
-If you cooperate--
-No.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.682
I won't ask adults for anything

29:29.601 --> 29:31.019
ever again.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.064
So…

29:37.317 --> 29:39.360
don't ask for my cooperation.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.034
This notice goes out
to all citizens of Hyosan.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.871
For the safety of everyone in the camp…

29:49.954 --> 29:51.498
HOW MUCH TIME MUST PASS FOR THIS TO END?

29:51.581 --> 29:53.333
I MISS YOU, PLEASE JUST SHOW UP

29:53.416 --> 29:54.584
I MISS YOU

29:54.667 --> 29:56.544
I MISS YOU, PARK JU-YEONG

30:01.674 --> 30:03.593
I LOVE YOU, U-GI

30:06.221 --> 30:09.432
FLOWING WATER ENVELOPS ME
AND FLOWS INTO MY PAINFUL MEMORIES

30:09.516 --> 30:10.767
I'LL LET YOU GO NOW

30:25.240 --> 30:27.534
The National Assembly hearing
on the bombing of Hyosan

30:27.617 --> 30:30.119
has been postponed indefinitely
upon agreement.

30:30.203 --> 30:33.206
The party leaders announced
in a joint statement today

30:33.289 --> 30:35.875
they won't hold the hearing
until the epidemic situation…

30:35.959 --> 30:38.461
They won't hold the hearing
until the epidemic situation

30:38.545 --> 30:39.879
has been completely resolved.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.172
The National Security Council

30:41.256 --> 30:44.342
announced they will end martial law
in Hyosan today.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.053
This comes 3 months
and 17 days since martial law

30:47.136 --> 30:49.013
was imposed due to the outbreak.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.390
However, as a precaution,

30:50.473 --> 30:53.226
Hyosan residents will continue
to be quarantined.

30:53.726 --> 30:56.813
Although it has been more than four months
since the outbreak started,

30:56.896 --> 30:59.148
the Korea Disease Control
and Prevention Agency

30:59.232 --> 31:00.817
has failed to identify the virus.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.611
Since it is impossible
to know its incubation period,

31:03.695 --> 31:07.240
the agency opposed ending
the quarantine of Hyosan residents.

31:07.323 --> 31:10.326
Donations are pouring in
from across the nation

31:10.410 --> 31:13.830
for the Hyosan residents who have been
living in quarantine for four months.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.720
Thank you for your hard work.

31:35.101 --> 31:38.646
This notice is to remind you
of the curfew times.

31:39.814 --> 31:45.028
Curfew lasts from midnight
to 6:00 a.m. the next morning.

31:46.946 --> 31:50.241
During this time,
please remain in your shelters

31:50.992 --> 31:54.454
and refrain from moving
for the livelihood of all.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.708
This time will be used

31:58.791 --> 32:04.213
to inspect facilities
and to clean and disinfect the camp.

32:05.965 --> 32:09.427
These measures are meant
to protect you from infection

32:10.428 --> 32:14.557
and to ensure that public facilities
remain clean for everyone to use.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.005
I-SAK, I MISS YOU

32:46.089 --> 32:49.425
NAM-RA, COME BACK

32:49.509 --> 32:53.471
CHEONG-SAN, I LOVE YOU

33:22.583 --> 33:25.670
LEE CHEONG-SAN

33:26.421 --> 33:27.380
Cheong-san.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.915
ZOMBIE VICTIM SPECIAL ADMISSION

34:02.999 --> 34:05.251
HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WHO SUFFERED
THE ZOMBIE ATTACK

34:05.334 --> 34:07.420
MUST BE GIVEN SPECIAL ADMISSIONS
INTO COLLEGES

34:08.796 --> 34:11.591
Goodness. My daughter is a senior too.
You poor thing.

34:11.674 --> 34:12.800
Rock, paper, scissors.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.429
-Shit.
-Hang in there. You'll get another chance.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.939
KOREAN RED CROSS
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

34:51.964 --> 34:53.299
Su-hyeok.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.101
Where have you been?

35:03.851 --> 35:04.936
I couldn't find you.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.772
I saw the others a few times.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.234
I wanted to see them,

35:13.069 --> 35:14.278
but I couldn't bring myself to.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.781
In case it would remind me.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.534
Can you forget if you don't see them?

35:21.369 --> 35:23.746
I went to the mountain last night
and saw a campfire.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.667
I think someone lit a fire
on the school rooftop.

35:30.670 --> 35:31.504
The rooftop?

35:31.587 --> 35:33.089
Are you sure?

35:34.465 --> 35:37.718
I may be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.890
Nam-ra said we should light a campfire

35:44.225 --> 35:45.601
if we ever meet again.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.823
I plan to go tonight.

35:59.448 --> 36:00.366
I'll go with you.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.124
I'm sorry about that day.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.377
About what?

36:11.919 --> 36:14.714
That day when Nam-ra tried to bite you.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.091
Sorry I couldn't do anything.

36:17.675 --> 36:18.551
It's okay.

36:21.762 --> 36:23.306
Your choice saved us all.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.350
Don't tell the others.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.478
It could be dangerous,
so let's go by ourselves.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.764
I told you not to tell them.

37:09.852 --> 37:12.146
Hey, I told you not to tell anyone else.

37:15.983 --> 37:16.943
Ha-ri.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.694
I said it was between us.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.282
She said she'd tell the cops
if we didn't take her.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.994
Fuck it.
They won't give me special admission.

37:27.745 --> 37:31.540
How is that related to this?
They'll lock us up if we get caught.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.960
I'd rather go to jail
if I can't get into college.

37:35.127 --> 37:37.296
Let's go.
Just climb over that wall, right?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.132
You're really going?

37:40.716 --> 37:41.592
All of you?

37:42.843 --> 37:44.637
You're not the only one
who feels indebted.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.180
We're all hurting just like you.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.307
Being alone doesn't make it hurt less.

37:53.729 --> 37:54.563
Go on.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.149
Didn't you say there was a rope?

37:57.233 --> 37:58.734
-How do we get up there?
-Move.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.028
-What are you doing?
-Are you sure?

38:01.112 --> 38:03.322
I'm going too.

38:03.406 --> 38:04.657
-Get on the ground.
-What?

38:04.740 --> 38:06.033
-Let's go.
-You heard me.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.387
I MISS YOU ALL

38:37.231 --> 38:38.065
What is that?

38:39.191 --> 38:40.026
Well,

38:40.901 --> 38:42.278
I couldn't throw that away.

38:44.697 --> 38:45.823
Joon-yeong.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.993
I'll buy you a box next time.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.043
I see a light.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.839
-Do you see it?
-Where?

39:02.506 --> 39:03.382
There.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.719
Hey, I think that really is our school.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.062
It's a total wreck.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.648
I know.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.049
Let's go.

39:52.139 --> 39:53.015
Okay.

40:03.150 --> 40:10.116
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

40:49.363 --> 40:50.906
Do you think it's really Nam-ra?

40:52.908 --> 40:53.742
Yes.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.495
I don't know why,

40:58.122 --> 40:59.206
but I think it's her.

41:52.968 --> 41:54.303
Who do you think it was?

41:59.099 --> 42:03.270
Maybe… it was kids
who came back to the school like us.

42:06.106 --> 42:09.902
Maybe it was a YouTuber or something.

42:09.985 --> 42:11.487
Kids who like haunted houses.

42:16.909 --> 42:17.743
No.

42:20.287 --> 42:21.121
It was Nam-ra.

42:23.123 --> 42:25.251
She probably lit it because she misses us.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.002
How do you know that?

42:30.798 --> 42:31.924
I don't.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.093
But I think I do.

42:37.888 --> 42:38.889
You made it.

42:41.058 --> 42:41.892
Hey.

42:42.643 --> 42:43.644
Prez.

42:45.479 --> 42:46.564
Nam-ra.

43:07.126 --> 43:08.002
Prez.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.880
Am I still the classroom president?

43:17.428 --> 43:18.262
I like that.

43:20.681 --> 43:21.807
Are you okay?

43:23.267 --> 43:24.310
How have you been?

43:40.117 --> 43:41.410
I've missed you.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.373
All of you.

43:49.418 --> 43:50.252
Nam-ra.

43:52.254 --> 43:54.673
I wanted to see you,
but I didn't think I should.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.008
No, it's okay.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.511
Let's go. Come with us.

44:01.430 --> 44:03.140
I still have things to do here.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.476
What things?

44:07.936 --> 44:09.730
There are a few more like me.

44:10.481 --> 44:14.151
Some fled outside of the school,
but there are still a few left.

44:15.944 --> 44:17.071
You're not a zombie.

44:18.822 --> 44:19.907
Don't say that.

44:20.532 --> 44:24.912
You know how students are not children
but not yet adults either?

44:26.163 --> 44:27.164
I'm like that.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.208
I'm neither a human…

44:31.627 --> 44:32.753
nor a monster.

44:33.462 --> 44:34.421
That's not true.

44:36.882 --> 44:38.258
Stay with us.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.720
It's okay if it's just us.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.736
We're friends even if we're not together.

44:59.530 --> 45:00.406
Right?

45:05.911 --> 45:06.745
No?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.373
Yes, you're right.

45:09.456 --> 45:13.085
Wherever we may be, we're friends.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.046
That's good enough.

45:21.677 --> 45:22.511
They're back.

45:28.976 --> 45:29.935
I'll be back.

51:01.016 --> 51:04.186
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

51:04.269 --> 51:07.230
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
