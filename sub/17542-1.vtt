00:52.040 --> 00:54.486
The stakes are high

00:54.760 --> 00:58.606
And the world hangs
in the balance

00:58.760 --> 00:59.966
He's a man

01:01.000 --> 01:05.004
And, oh, what a man
Of many talents

01:09.040 --> 01:14.080
If the sky starts to fall
There's no one bigger

01:15.640 --> 01:20.168
With his finger
on the trigger

01:21.040 --> 01:23.042
He's the man with the plan

01:23.160 --> 01:25.401
The one with the gun
Kevin

01:25.800 --> 01:27.609
Nothing can stop him

01:28.000 --> 01:29.684
The spy in disguise

01:29.760 --> 01:31.842
With his eye on the prize
Hart

01:32.240 --> 01:34.686
He's taking over the world

01:34.840 --> 01:36.001
Agent Five-Four

01:36.080 --> 01:38.811
Stronger than Thor
Kevin

01:38.880 --> 01:40.769
Kevin fears nothing
Hart

01:40.840 --> 01:42.683
With a license to kill

01:42.760 --> 01:44.888
And jokes that are ill
Kevin

01:45.160 --> 01:48.607
He's taking over the world

01:48.840 --> 01:50.490
Come through, Kevin

01:50.880 --> 01:51.881
Kevin

01:52.160 --> 01:53.605
He's the one that you call

01:53.680 --> 01:56.251
If your back's at the wall
Hart

01:56.360 --> 01:58.727
Agent Five-Four
Kevin

01:58.880 --> 02:00.291
The guy that prevails

02:00.360 --> 02:02.601
On a whole global scale
Kevin

02:03.040 --> 02:07.523
He's taking over the world
Kevin Hart

02:10.000 --> 02:11.764
Kevin!

02:36.840 --> 02:37.841
You're late.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.684
Better late than never.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.760
Do you have the package?

02:46.240 --> 02:47.765
Of course, I have the package, Kevin.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.251
Don't I always have the package?

02:49.320 --> 02:50.321
No, you don't.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.044
Which is why I'm asking you,
"Do you have the package?"

02:52.120 --> 02:53.360
When was the last time
I didn't have the package?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.601
You didn't have the package in Guam.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.727
Guam?
Yes, Guam.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.847
Why you gonna bring up Guam?

02:56.920 --> 02:58.524
I'm answering a question
that you asked me.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.001
What are you talking about?
You just... What are you saying?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.809
You didn't have the package in Guam,
which is why I asked you,

03:02.920 --> 03:04.206
"Did you have the package?"
Yes, I got the package.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.930
So if you had said that
when I first asked you,

03:06.000 --> 03:07.240
then we wouldn't even be
having this conversation.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.367
Guam is over.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.601
I know! I'm not thinking about Guam!

03:09.680 --> 03:11.444
We at another place,
another time. Let's go.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.521
All you ever talk about is Guam.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.726
Don't storm past me!
Fuck Guam.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.406
Same shit you did in Guam!
Guam all over again!

03:16.480 --> 03:17.527
Okay, listen.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.931
You walking away
is not gonna change

03:19.000 --> 03:20.206
the point that
I'm trying to make.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.009
Okay, I forgot something
one time! Just one time!

03:22.080 --> 03:23.764
Okay, so did you forget it?
One time.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.365
Okay, so that validates what I'm saying...
Mr. Hart.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.329
Do you have your buy-in money?

03:27.400 --> 03:28.811
Of course.
Here it is.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.566
Thank you.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.801
Let's cut the shit.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.769
Put your game face on,
'cause there's our guy.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.930
Girl, if you don't grab my arm...

03:37.000 --> 03:38.490
Grab my arm.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.049
Good evening.
How are you?

03:43.160 --> 03:46.687
And you must be LeBron's little
replacement.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.841
Yes?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.082
Welcome to the game, Mr...

03:52.160 --> 03:53.525
Hart.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.080
The name is Kevin Hart.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.004
Or maybe it's Mr. Bond, huh?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.411
It's a little confusing.
He's so little.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.970
What? What?
What'd he say?

04:04.040 --> 04:05.371
Okay, Kevin. Kevin.
What did you say?

04:05.440 --> 04:07.204
Don't let him get you
off your game. Okay?

04:07.280 --> 04:10.045
Come on now.
Good luck.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.090
Luck is for people
who are inadequate...

04:12.160 --> 04:13.730
Okay, Kevin, not now.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.290
Okay. Right.
Not now.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.526
Go do it.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.810
Whiskey, please.

04:23.720 --> 04:24.721
Coming right up.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.646
There you are.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.371
I only ordered one.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.521
Oh, I know.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.208
The game is no-limit poker.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.851
Five communal cards.
Two in the hole.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.161
I'm sorry, what?
Two cards in the hole.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.004
No, nothing's
going in my hole.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.206
I don't know what game this is,

04:58.280 --> 04:59.281
but we're not gonna play it today.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.971
No, sir. What I'm going to do,
I'm going to put out five cards

05:02.040 --> 05:03.849
and then I will later pull out two more.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.331
Oh! Oh.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.640
Okay, well, talk slower.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.610
Minimum stake is $1 million.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.570
Lines begin at
$5,000 and $10,000.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.802
This game is winner take all.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.611
There are no prizes
for second place.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.761
Good luck to you all.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.964
It's a shame you gotta
drink alone tonight.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.491
I said, it's a shame you gotta
drink alone tonight.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.686
I heard you.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.330
I bet $50,000.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.330
I fold.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.091
$50,000 to you, Mr. Hart.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.967
$100,000.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.528
$100,000? You serious?
You haven't even looked at your cards.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.329
I don't need to look at my cards.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.686
I see right through you,
and you know what I see?

05:44.760 --> 05:46.762
I see someone who
doesn't have shit.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.526
What does he have
that I don't have?

05:49.880 --> 05:50.927
Everything.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.087
Look at him.
He's super intelligent.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.049
What are these?
Five.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.770
Five? Okay,
so let me count this out.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.888
Five, 10.
What are the black?

05:59.960 --> 06:02.361
You don't need black.
You have these big blue ones.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.726
He's charming.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.846
Why wouldn't you use two blue ones?

06:05.920 --> 06:07.604
I don't understand,
it's the same.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.609
For some reason,
I thought that me and him were in a hand.

06:09.720 --> 06:10.721
You little sawed-off...

06:10.800 --> 06:12.131
He's charismatic.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.164
Fuck, you all took
my iPhone when I came in.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.561
You don't have to do math.
Just put another blue one on top of them.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.687
I gotta start over.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.285
Every time you all talk to me,
I gotta start over again.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.120
You know what?

06:23.200 --> 06:26.329
I see your point.
I see your point.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.085
And everything on him isn't small.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.844
Sir, if you wanna talk
to me, I'm right here.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.490
"How did this idiot get in here," you say?

06:57.440 --> 06:58.487
Enough!

06:59.480 --> 07:01.801
What the fuck was that?
Is that your mouth?

07:01.880 --> 07:05.441
Oh, my God, you just threw a bucket
of shit at my face just now.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.329
I smelled that.
Nobody else smelled that?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.528
Well, it smelled like
you just threw shit at my nose,

07:09.600 --> 07:10.761
that's what it smelled like.

07:10.840 --> 07:11.921
Baby, baby.
Yes?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.241
You look thirsty.
What can I get you to drink, baby?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.687
You know what?
I'll take a martini. Shaken, not stirred.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.922
If I could have three ice cubes,
shave the last,

07:19.040 --> 07:20.769
put Tabasco sauce on top,
but just a little bit...

07:20.840 --> 07:23.002
Okay, I ain't gonna remember all that shit.
Now what you want?

07:23.080 --> 07:24.286
Whatever. Whatever
you are gonna be getting.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.407
Okay.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.084
Okay? Got it?
Okay.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.571
Tell him, don't put it
in a sippy cup.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.602
One Kevin Hartini coming right up.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.606
No, just give him a beer.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.330
Here you are, Mr. Hart.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.201
Thank you.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.161
Hey, Kev?

07:45.240 --> 07:47.402
It's on you. So like,
bet, check, fold...

07:47.480 --> 07:49.209
Well aware of the poker rules,
Mr. Cheadle.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.446
You should fucking do something.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.567
Can I have a second, please?

07:51.720 --> 07:53.051
Go ahead.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.166
Where's it at?
Who's it on?

07:55.240 --> 07:58.323
It's on you. So you
can check, bet, or fold.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.050
Pick one and fucking do it.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.326
I see what's going on here.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.051
Gentlemen, I would like to introduce you
to a case of

08:04.120 --> 08:05.884
"I don't have enough
money to call a bet."

08:05.960 --> 08:07.405
I can afford the next hand.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.970
Obviously,
I'm sitting here with chips.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.326
She got money,
this motherfucker got money.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.447
Everybody got money, Kevin.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.170
It's that you're irritating
the fuck out of me

08:13.240 --> 08:14.366
'cause you're not doing anything.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.204
What happened, Don?

08:16.320 --> 08:18.322
Daddy's tank ran dry?
What are you talking about?

08:18.400 --> 08:20.971
Chickens ain't clucking?
Cows ain't mooing?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.405
Have you lost your
fucking mind, Kevin?

08:22.520 --> 08:25.649
Oh, I know what it is.
There's been a vacancy at Hotel Rwanda.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.006
Ain't nobody booking them suites.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.411
Are you talking about a movie now, Kevin?

08:28.480 --> 08:29.481
You know what you're mad at?

08:29.560 --> 08:32.325
'Cause you looked at your hand
and there's nothing but a House of Lies.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.283
You're referring to the show?
That was a good one.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.647
No, most people say House of Cards
and they mean House of Lies.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.160
I didn't.
No, you did that good. Now fucking bet!

08:41.760 --> 08:45.162
"My name's Don Cheadle
and I'm mad because I'm not Iron Man.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.169
"I'm the black Iron Man, and I'm rusty."
Stop talking, man.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.083
"I squeak when I go."
Take it easy.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.170
All right, you're not making
fucking sense, Kevin,

08:52.240 --> 08:53.287
and I'ma punch you in the face.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.521
I'ma make all of that bleed

08:54.600 --> 08:56.807
if you don't goddamn well
do something right now!

08:56.880 --> 08:58.769
Do something!
Raise.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.043
Whoa! No, no, no, I didn't raise.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.361
That was obvious, I made a mistake.
Don't!

09:03.480 --> 09:05.687
Hey, you cannot touch this pot, sir.
I'm fucking touching the pot!

09:05.760 --> 09:07.444
These are my chips!
Are you motherfuckers in cahoots?

09:07.520 --> 09:08.601
I call.
I call that.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.085
Oh, you call that?
You know what I call? I call that.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.525
You know what I call?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.800
What you doing?
Grab him!

09:14.880 --> 09:16.450
Okay! Okay!

09:16.800 --> 09:18.723
I'm gonna kill you, Kevin!
Get your ass up outta here.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.881
Get up outta here!

09:19.960 --> 09:21.371
I'll see you in the parking lot, Kevin!

09:21.440 --> 09:24.091
You motherfucker!
I'ma kill you! I hate you!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.446
Raise. $2 million.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.881
Whoa.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.490
Go all in!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.162
I'm all in. All of it.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.081
All in.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.646
Call.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.722
This hand is gettin' kind of crazy.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.211
Show your hand, please.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.443
Ouch.
Full house. Aces for kings.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.521
God.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.250
That's over $5 million.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.209
Mr. Hart.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.129
I didn't know
he had that. Hmm.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.045
Uh-oh. What's that?

10:11.120 --> 10:13.122
Ace to five.
Straight flush.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.804
"Straight flush."
What is it?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.087
Straight flush.
"Straight flush."

10:17.160 --> 10:18.207
Mr. Hart wins.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.084
Whoo! Yes!

10:23.200 --> 10:24.247
Uh-oh!

10:25.880 --> 10:27.291
Chips! Chips,
chips, chips!

10:27.360 --> 10:28.725
This all for you.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.523
One, two, three...

10:34.640 --> 10:36.642
Ninety-six, ninety-seven,
ninety-eight...

10:37.680 --> 10:39.091
Hey.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.964
Where's the money at?
I put it in the case.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.485
In what case?
In this case.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.561
You put all that money in this case?

10:43.640 --> 10:44.880
Why are you asking such dumb questions?

10:44.960 --> 10:46.166
Yes, I put the money in the case!

10:46.240 --> 10:48.481
Oh, so now you can turn into
David fucking Copperfield!

10:48.560 --> 10:50.130
Tell me... Woman!

10:50.680 --> 10:52.603
You act like the money
couldn't have fell off the table.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.170
That's possible.
Mr. Hart?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.044
Ah! You must think that
you're a very funny guy, huh?

11:03.480 --> 11:05.801
You have to think that
you're the funniest man in America

11:05.880 --> 11:07.211
to even think about pulling off

11:07.280 --> 11:09.169
what you're trying to pull off today. Hmm?

11:09.800 --> 11:12.690
That you're doing what nobody else
out there is doing, huh?

11:13.160 --> 11:17.370
You have to think that you have the entire
world by the balls.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.566
Hmm? This what you think?

11:19.680 --> 11:20.806
You insult me.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.843
But I'm going to give you one chance
to get out of here alive.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.967
Without the money.

11:27.840 --> 11:32.607
Then I don't ever want to see
that little shit face of yours ever again.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.442
Now, hand over the case.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.681
Mmm-mmm.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.601
I'm not giving you my money.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.001
This is gonna pay for my global tour.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.651
Eighteen seconds.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.768
Eighteen seconds, but I could shave
three seconds off,

12:01.840 --> 12:03.046
gets me 15 seconds.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.884
Minus the two,
that puts me at 13.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.088
Thirteen plus four
puts me back at 17.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.650
Seventeen plus one
puts me back at 18.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.883
Eighteen minus four is 14.
Fourteen minus two is 12.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.411
Twelve times pi?

12:13.480 --> 12:16.484
Fuck! What is 12 times pi?
Wait, pi? What is pi?

12:16.840 --> 12:18.365
Uh, four?
Okay, so we'll go with four.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.566
Forget it.
Forget pi, forget pi.

12:22.640 --> 12:23.687
Just do the 14 minus two.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.091
Fourteen minus two
puts me back at 12.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.241
12 seconds.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.810
That's what
it's gonna take.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.691
Are you fucking
kidding me?

13:19.200 --> 13:21.521
What the fuck?
Damn it!

13:22.560 --> 13:24.324
He's a bleeder!

13:25.400 --> 13:26.401
Shit!

13:26.920 --> 13:29.241
Fuck! Shit!

13:39.680 --> 13:40.966
What the fuck
was you doing?

13:41.440 --> 13:42.441
Huh?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.971
Ain't shit on you,
your dress ain't messed up, hair all nice.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.041
You wanna explain yourself?

13:47.120 --> 13:50.408
Kevin, I'm Halle Berry.
I don't get messed up.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.766
Let's go.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.683
That's a bunch of Halle bullshit!

13:53.760 --> 13:55.808
Could've gotten me
a napkin or something!

13:58.520 --> 14:01.569
I didn't even start the watch!
Goddamn it, Kevin!

14:03.440 --> 14:04.680
I can't just walk
around like this.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.410
This means I'm gonna be late.
You know that, don't you?

14:06.480 --> 14:07.641
I'ma get you some clothes.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.006
Will you stop? Stop!
What?

14:09.080 --> 14:10.491
Look at me!
I'm covered in fucking blood!

14:10.560 --> 14:11.686
I see that, Kevin.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.127
But nobody around here notices that,
so just walk normal.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.440
What it is, baby?

14:17.520 --> 14:19.329
What the hell happened to you, man?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.687
I love you, too.
Nigga, you look dead!

14:21.760 --> 14:23.728
See? I'm saying people
already notice this shit.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.888
Yo, you on your period,
my man?

14:25.960 --> 14:27.564
Ain't every man?
What?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.244
Halle, you gotta get me
some damn clothes!

14:35.280 --> 14:36.884
What took you so long?

14:36.960 --> 14:38.041
What kind of question is that?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.121
What do you mean,
what took me so long?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.202
I was getting the blood off of me.
What were you doing?

14:41.280 --> 14:42.770
I thought you was gonna be long.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.768
Why would you think I would be long?
Because you're a woman.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.008
Women take long.
Everyone knows that.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.650
How about, "Kevin,
you look nice"?

14:48.720 --> 14:50.927
How about, "I see what
you did with the time"?

14:51.720 --> 14:53.768
You don't feel like a compliment
is necessary?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.968
That's your problem.
Like, why you got an attitude?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.443
I just gotta get my mind right. So much
stuff happened today.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.760
Just calm down.
I know.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.171
Hey, thank you.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.121
Shit!

15:07.200 --> 15:09.646
Close your mouth, Kevin.
Let's go.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.841
Oh!

15:15.480 --> 15:17.960
Where the fuck you get a gun from?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.565
Kevin, we love you! Yay!

15:24.560 --> 15:26.608
Kevin, you the man!

15:26.680 --> 15:28.523
Kevin Hart, we love you, man!

15:29.160 --> 15:30.400
Shit.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.165
You hear that?
I do.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.726
Shit.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.801
What now?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.291
What now is I do my job.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.600
Okay.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.966
Be careful.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.201
Wait a minute.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.123
Is Halle Berry giving me the look?

15:44.200 --> 15:45.281
Okay, listen up, people.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.850
If you think I'ma have
Halle Berry in my movie

15:46.920 --> 15:47.967
and I'm not gonna kiss her,

15:48.040 --> 15:49.371
you got another thing coming.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.010
That's goddamn Halle Berry!

15:51.080 --> 15:52.525
She about to get a berry blast
of these lips,

15:52.600 --> 15:53.647
I'll tell you that.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.850
Well, now that I know what we both want,
I'll stop wasting time.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.721
Oh!
Mmm!

16:01.920 --> 16:03.160
What are you doing?
You know what I'm doing.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.089
I'm about to kiss you.
Nobody said anything about a kiss.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.646
Just do a little one.
I'm not kissing you, Kevin. Come on.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.051
Do this.
Okay.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.845
No. With your lips.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.881
Fine, forget it.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.405
Hey, Tim?
Yeah, Kev?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.801
Let's just take it from the top.
Good idea.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.166
Ready?
I'm ready.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.208
And action. Be careful.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.850
No, you be careful.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.321
Because being careful is
what I'm most careful at.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.606
I do it very carefully.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.489
What the fuck did you just say?

16:28.560 --> 16:30.403
Goddamn it, just... Shit!

16:31.280 --> 16:32.327
Fuck me!

16:33.920 --> 16:35.843
Don't worry about me.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.686
You hear me?

16:37.760 --> 16:39.410
Are you sure you don't want to kiss?
Kevin...

16:39.480 --> 16:40.527
Shh.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.405
Ew.
Okay?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.803
All right, boy, let's cut the shit.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.008
Let's do what you do best.
Let's go make these people laugh.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.010
It's showtime!

17:26.319 --> 17:29.290
Philadelphia,
make some fucking noise!

17:34.320 --> 17:36.971
No.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.644
That's not good enough for me.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.849
Goddamn it, we sold a football
stadium out tonight.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.485
So I need to hear that!

17:44.520 --> 17:46.045
I need to hear that!

17:51.160 --> 17:54.403
So I'ma ask my city one more time...

17:54.480 --> 17:58.326
Philadelphia, make some fucking noise!

18:00.760 --> 18:01.841
Yeah!

18:03.160 --> 18:04.286
Yeah!

18:05.680 --> 18:06.727
Yes!

18:07.000 --> 18:09.287
Goddamn it, we about to get loose.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.763
I can honestly say that
the city of Philadelphia has my back.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.842
Is it safe to say that, Philly?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.602
It's safe to say that.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.923
I think it's only right
that I show Philadelphia that love back.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.523
Can I see Philadelphia behind me?
Can I do that, please?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.170
Can I see my city behind me?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.130
We about to have
a good time tonight.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.123
We love you, Kevin!

18:33.200 --> 18:36.966
The name of this show is called
What Now?, people.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.963
The reason why I decided
to call it What Now?,

18:39.040 --> 18:42.283
is because that's the question
that I get the most.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.284
"Kevin, what the fuck
are you gonna do now?"

18:45.360 --> 18:47.931
I love that question
because I always have an answer for it.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.047
I'm alive.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.681
I'm still experiencing shit,
which still means I have stuff to talk about.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.485
For example, people, I'm engaged.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.846
I'm about to get married again soon.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.046
Okay?

18:57.120 --> 18:58.326
Yes.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.801
I told my lady, I said,
before we get married, we gotta move.

19:01.880 --> 19:02.881
I did tell her that.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.407
It's not that I don't like where we live.
I just don't like the area.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.244
It's not the house, it's the area.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.651
See, I don't wanna be in Hollywood,

19:09.720 --> 19:11.370
staring at all the Hollywood shit.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.601
So I moved out to the suburbs.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.842
Fucked around, moved
around a bunch of wildlife.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.843
I don't like the animals
around my house.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.445
This is real shit right now.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.285
Right now, I have
a raccoon problem, people.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.010
Not raccoons.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.924
A raccoon. One raccoon.
This raccoon's a bitch.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.650
I can't stand this raccoon.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.530
I got glass doors
in the back of my house, right?

19:30.600 --> 19:31.726
I'm sitting in the living room,

19:31.800 --> 19:35.361
I can see into my backyard
through the glass doors.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.365
Outta nowhere,
a raccoon walks up to the glass doors.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.125
But not like a raccoon should,
not on all fours.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.765
Raccoon's on two feet.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.320
Motherfucker walked up
to the doors like this, swear to God.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.845
This is real shit.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.081
Scared the shit outta me.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.889
It looked like a Nigga
was walking in my backyard.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.331
That's what it looked like.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.209
I saw him,
I said, "Oh, shit!

19:54.280 --> 19:56.044
"Look at that goddamn
raccoon right there!"

19:56.120 --> 19:59.044
He saw me, I see him,
we're looking at each other.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.531
This is what scared
the shit outta me.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.728
To get a better look in my house,

20:02.800 --> 20:04.882
he put his hand on the glass,

20:06.480 --> 20:08.323
and started looking in the window.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.925
I see him, he see me.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.126
He starts fucking with the locks.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.248
When he couldn't get in, he got mad.
He fake shot at me twice.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.409
Bang, bang!

20:19.480 --> 20:21.084
Then he grabbed his dick,
disappeared into the dark.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.286
This is a true story.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.926
You gotta understand, people,
I don't like raccoons.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.571
I can't stand raccoons
because I don't like the way they look.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.086
They look like criminals.
They got a black mask, gloves.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.208
Everything about
a raccoon says crime.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.204
My lady gets home, I said,

20:36.280 --> 20:37.361
"Babe, we gotta get
the fuck out this house.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.488
"A raccoon came up
to the glass doors,

20:39.560 --> 20:42.166
"put his hand on the glass,
saw me, shot at me twice.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.241
"Bang, bang!

20:43.320 --> 20:45.527
"Then he grabs his dick,
disappeared into the dark."

20:46.560 --> 20:47.971
My lady goes,

20:48.760 --> 20:52.606
"What do you get
out of lying so much?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.602
"Like what does that do for you?"

20:55.680 --> 20:57.489
I said, "Who the fuck is lying?

20:57.560 --> 21:00.325
"Who makes up a lie about a raccoon
come up to the window,

21:00.400 --> 21:03.847
"going bang, bang, grabbing his dick,
disappearing into the dark?

21:03.920 --> 21:07.447
"Like, whose life is that bad that
they gotta sit at home all day,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.124
"and make some shit like that up?"

21:09.440 --> 21:12.330
She said, "Obviously you,
because you're lying, Kevin.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.731
"You know how I know you lying?

21:13.800 --> 21:17.088
"'Cause a raccoon
can't go, 'Bang, bang.'

21:17.160 --> 21:19.845
"You know why?
'Cause a raccoon don't have no thumbs.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.526
"So how can a raccoon go,
'Bang, bang'?"

21:23.880 --> 21:27.202
"Bitch, maybe he did this.
Maybe he just did this right here.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.165
"What difference does it make?

21:30.240 --> 21:34.165
"The point is that he grabbed his dick,
disappeared into the dark.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.129
"We got a dick-grabbing
raccoon on the loose,

21:36.200 --> 21:37.690
"you worried about
his fucking thumbs.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.129
"You need to get your priorities straight,
that's what needs to happen."

21:42.200 --> 21:44.521
I got a lot of animals out there, people.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.206
Coyotes, mountain lions,
rattlesnakes.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.123
It's at the point now
where I don't like taking out trash.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.247
I'm being honest with you.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.482
The reason I don't like
taking out trash at my house

21:52.560 --> 21:54.801
is 'cause to take out the trash,
I gotta walk outside,

21:54.880 --> 21:56.644
I gotta walk down my driveway.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.643
Trash cans are at
the end of my driveway.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.485
My driveway is long as shit, people.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.721
Okay?

22:03.240 --> 22:05.766
It also gets real dark
in my driveway.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.491
Reason why it gets so dark
in my driveway at nighttime

22:08.560 --> 22:11.006
is because I turned down
the option to get lights

22:11.080 --> 22:13.606
going down the side of my driveway.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.330
Reason why I turned down the option

22:15.400 --> 22:16.925
is because I thought the contractors

22:17.000 --> 22:18.240
were trying to take advantage of me

22:18.320 --> 22:19.845
because they knew that I had money.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.207
I don't trust people
that do this when they talk.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.364
Like that's how you talk to me, like,

22:26.440 --> 22:28.920
"Hey, man, you gotta get some lights.
It gets real dark out here.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.286
"You gotta get some lights."

22:30.360 --> 22:31.850
I don't need no fucking lights.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.207
It's a driveway.
You drive in, you drive out.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.282
What the fuck I need lights for?

22:37.880 --> 22:39.564
I was wrong, people.
I need lights.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.211
Can't see shit in this goddamn driveway.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.290
You gotta understand, I don't like

22:44.360 --> 22:46.010
being in the dark, hearing animal noises,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.923
especially when I can't see the animal.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.206
It fucks with me.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.250
When you're by yourself and you get scared,
you do stupid shit.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.321
When you hear this...

22:58.640 --> 23:00.802
You do stupid shit
when you get scared.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.806
"You bite me,
I'll bite you back, bitch!"

23:08.280 --> 23:10.362
You start doing shit
you saw in the movies.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.568
"What are you waiting for?"

23:15.640 --> 23:18.928
It got to the point
where I start grabbing the trash,

23:19.040 --> 23:21.281
running down the driveway,
throwing the trash in the trash can,

23:21.360 --> 23:22.805
running back to the house.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.570
One day I locked myself out of the house.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.847
Scariest 17 seconds of my life, people.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.649
"Open up the door!"

23:33.680 --> 23:35.967
What is this when you get scared?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.567
Whenever you're afraid,

23:42.640 --> 23:44.608
the first person you
see is fully responsible

23:44.680 --> 23:46.330
for whatever you were afraid of.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.364
"Bitch, where the fuck was you at
all that time I was outside?

23:50.840 --> 23:54.162
"Some shit licked my neck,
I'm out here calling you.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.129
"You in here cooking,
that's your problem."

23:59.040 --> 24:00.326
It got to the point
where I told my lady, I said,

24:00.400 --> 24:02.846
"Yo, I'm not taking out trash anymore.
I'm not gonna do it."

24:02.960 --> 24:05.531
She said, "Well, I'm not gonna do it."
I said, "You don't have to."

24:05.600 --> 24:08.080
"It's not a woman's job,
it's a man's job.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.527
"I'ma make my son do it.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.601
"He's seven years old.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.449
"It's time for him to start pulling his
weight around here.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.567
"He don't do shit."

24:16.000 --> 24:17.445
That's the beautiful thing
about being a dad.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.130
You can do what you
want when you want,

24:19.200 --> 24:20.884
can't nobody say shit about it.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.724
I woke my son up at
2:00 in the morning

24:22.800 --> 24:24.484
with a complete bullshit story.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.564
I kicked his bed.
"Get your ass up! Get up!

24:27.640 --> 24:30.166
"Didn't I tell you to get that goddamn
trash out last night?"

24:30.280 --> 24:32.123
First of all, that was a lie.
I never said that.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.366
Never said anything
like that.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.686
He woke up, he was confused.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.762
"What? What? No.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.251
"You never said that. What?"

24:39.320 --> 24:41.561
"You calling me a liar?
You telling me I'm lying?

24:41.640 --> 24:44.120
"Get your ass up.
Get that goddamn trash out."

24:44.200 --> 24:47.010
Private schools
are fucking my kids up.

24:47.080 --> 24:51.608
My son, he said,
"All right, all right. All right."

24:55.760 --> 24:58.491
He goes, "Let me get my flops."

24:58.600 --> 24:59.601
What?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.683
"Your flops?

25:03.760 --> 25:07.845
"Boy, if you don't get your black/white ass
down these goddamn steps,

25:07.920 --> 25:11.163
"get this fucking trash,
I'ma knock your head loose in here."

25:12.960 --> 25:15.691
My son goes downstairs,
he grabs the trash.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.922
He's about to walk outside,
he sees it's real dark.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.800
He goes, "Dad, it's real dark outside.
Can you come with me?"

25:26.960 --> 25:28.803
"No. No, I cannot.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.001
"No.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.651
"It's not my journey, son.
This is your journey.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.046
"It's about you becoming a man.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.884
"You gotta do
this by yourself."

25:35.960 --> 25:40.045
My son grabs the trash,
he's literally walking outside.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.401
He goes down the driveway.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.562
I could tell when he got scared,
'cause he stopped.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.723
He started doing this shit right here.
He started looking around.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.731
When he looked at me, I said,
"See, that's why I don't like doing that shit.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.361
"Go, you're all right.
Finish. Finish."

25:53.440 --> 25:56.922
He put the trash in the trash can,
starts walking back.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.685
Outta nowhere,
my son takes off running.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.164
I mean, running, haul assing
towards the house.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.890
Running as fast as he can.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.484
I got scared because I couldn't see
what he was running from.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.650
I couldn't see it.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.050
So I closed the door.
I closed the door.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.009
No, I did.
I know it was wrong, but I did it.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.490
I don't wanna lie.
I shut the door.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.762
I told myself, depending on what it was,

26:25.840 --> 26:27.205
was gonna determine
if I open up

26:27.280 --> 26:29.009
the door or not
when he got back.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.445
If it was something crazy,
I was just gonna put my hand on the glass.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.488
I was gonna say,
"Son, touch the glass one last time.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.608
"I hate that it had to be this way."

26:39.320 --> 26:42.130
My biggest fear in life
is seeing somebody that I love

26:42.200 --> 26:45.090
get attacked by an animal
that I can't beat.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.606
That's a fear.
What do you do?

26:47.680 --> 26:49.728
What do you do?

26:49.800 --> 26:52.087
You look happy.
Are you in love, man?

26:52.160 --> 26:53.889
What do you do
if you see your lady

26:53.960 --> 26:56.247
running down the driveway
as fast as she can?

26:56.320 --> 26:58.721
Outta nowhere,
the Tasmanian Devil jump out,

26:58.800 --> 27:00.211
grab her face from the back?

27:01.760 --> 27:02.966
You wanna know the answer
to that question?

27:03.040 --> 27:05.805
Not a goddamn thing,
that's what the fuck you do.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.043
That's the Tasmanian Devil.
You ain't never seen no shit like that.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.929
If you look outside
and all you hear is...

27:14.960 --> 27:16.962
You're not fucking
going out there.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.731
All you gonna do is react.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.042
Oh! Oh! Oh!

27:25.400 --> 27:27.402
"Get the fuck off of her!

27:28.560 --> 27:30.005
"She had enough!"

27:32.440 --> 27:35.649
My lady got mad at me when I said that.
She got pissed off.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.210
She got pissed off.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.170
She said, "So if I got
attacked by an animal,

27:39.240 --> 27:41.004
"you wouldn't come
out there and help me?"

27:41.080 --> 27:43.401
I said, "It depends on the animal.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.962
"If it's a cat, I'll come out
there and kick the cat.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.520
"I'll kick the shit out of a cat.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.921
"But if it's a mountain lion, fuck no.
I'm not going out there.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.331
"Ain't no way in hell."

27:53.440 --> 27:55.761
She says, "So you
would just let me die?"

27:57.640 --> 28:00.291
"If that was God's plan.
I'm not gonna...

28:01.080 --> 28:03.082
"I'm not gonna fuck with God's plan.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.809
"Who am I to rewrite
what God wrote?

28:05.880 --> 28:07.689
"That's what God wrote
next to your name.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.161
"It said 'death by
mountain lion attack.'

28:10.240 --> 28:12.766
"Who the fuck am I to rewrite that?"

28:13.760 --> 28:14.886
I'm being honest with you all.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.564
You know the real reason
why I wouldn't help my lady

28:16.640 --> 28:18.563
if she got attacked
by a mountain lion?

28:18.640 --> 28:20.244
I don't know if I wanna be
with a woman

28:20.320 --> 28:21.890
that survived a mountain lion attack.

28:21.960 --> 28:22.961
I don't...

28:23.040 --> 28:24.724
I don't know if I'ma feel
the same way about you

28:24.800 --> 28:26.211
when you come out of that attack.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.321
Like, what if he got you good?

28:29.400 --> 28:31.129
What if he bit your neck up?

28:31.200 --> 28:33.089
Or if he bit your shoulder off?

28:33.160 --> 28:34.764
You ain't got no shoulder no more?

28:34.840 --> 28:35.887
That's tough.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.801
That's tough.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.449
I can't be with no girl
that don't have no shoulder.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.090
I can't. I'm sorry.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.969
You can call me
an asshole all you want.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.008
I can't be with a girl that can't do this.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.331
Mmm! If you can't do that...

28:49.400 --> 28:52.244
If you can't shoulder shrug, bitch,
I can't be with you.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.804
You can't shoulder shrug, bitch?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.001
Mmm!

28:57.040 --> 28:59.930
You know how many times
you shoulder shrug in a day?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.684
You know how many times
you shoulder shrug?

29:01.800 --> 29:03.131
Look, you did it
a little bit just now.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.248
Little bit.
Look at you. Little bit.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.081
Ladies, let me
tell you something.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.366
You don't know how important

29:09.440 --> 29:11.647
your shoulders are until
you lose one of them.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.768
Life will change without both shoulders,
I promise you that.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.241
I tell you what, you could
kiss halter tops good-bye.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.725
That's over.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.682
Every shirt you put on
gonna look like a goddamn toga outfit.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.445
All that shit coming across the chest.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.444
I don't wanna be with a toga bitch.
I don't want her.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.365
The girl that look like
she won a pageant every day.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.690
You won every day?

29:42.600 --> 29:44.568
Oh! Here come Michelle.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.201
Here come Miss America.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.925
I don't wanna be with her.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.287
I tell you what,

29:53.360 --> 29:55.169
if you got one shoulder

29:55.240 --> 29:58.289
and we get pulled over by the cops,
we're going to jail.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.640
We're going to jail.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.246
'Cause everything you do
is gonna come off as sarcasm.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.731
"Ma'am, do you know
why I pulled you over?"

30:04.800 --> 30:05.847
"No."

30:05.920 --> 30:09.811
"Get the fuck out of the car.
Right now! Get out the car!

30:09.880 --> 30:11.962
"You wanna be a smartass?
You're going to jail."

30:12.080 --> 30:15.129
"I'm not! I'm not! This is how it is.
I'm stuck with this.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.247
"Don't do this, please."

30:18.440 --> 30:20.329
Cop have a tough time
grabbing you out the car.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.289
"Get your ass
out the goddamn..."

30:25.240 --> 30:27.766
You can't be cold
with one shoulder.

30:29.880 --> 30:33.407
You can't shiver
with one shoulder.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.243
Ain't nobody gonna
believe you.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.680
"What the fuck is
wrong with you?"

30:41.760 --> 30:44.525
"It's freezing in here."

30:44.600 --> 30:48.764
"No, bitch, you twitching.
That's drugs. I know drugs when I see it."

30:49.440 --> 30:51.090
"Get your high ass out
of my goddamn house.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.281
"You're high!"

30:53.640 --> 30:55.290
If you only got one shoulder,

30:55.360 --> 30:57.966
the only game you'll be good at
is a game of tag.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.529
Can't nobody tag you.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.244
You out there dipping everything.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.481
"Shit!"

31:13.280 --> 31:15.282
"I can't tag this bitch, man!

31:15.880 --> 31:17.166
"She out here dipping everything."

31:17.240 --> 31:18.844
"You gotta go for
the shoulder side."

31:20.800 --> 31:23.804
Ladies, I can feel you judging me.
Stop judging me. I feel it.

31:24.600 --> 31:28.002
"Kevin, you wrong. You wrong.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.809
"That woman loved you.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.441
"She was with you from the beginning.
She held you down."

31:33.520 --> 31:35.170
Let me tell you something, ladies.

31:35.240 --> 31:38.164
You can't hold nobody down
without two shoulders.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.163
It's a scientific fact.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.565
You need two shoulders.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.720
I'll start it with you guys.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.729
I'll ask you a question.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.604
Sweetie, do you think
you're the type of woman that could

31:49.720 --> 31:52.121
stay with your man
regardless of any freak accident?

31:52.200 --> 31:53.326
Yeah?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.801
You know why I love asking
women that question?

31:55.880 --> 31:58.565
Because your answers
are never realistic.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.644
See, women answer
questions with emotion.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.768
Emotion made you say yes.

32:03.840 --> 32:07.526
"Yes! Yes, I love him! Yes!"

32:08.520 --> 32:10.409
That's emotion.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.084
You don't even know
the fucking scenario.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.406
You don't even
know what happened.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.649
So I'ma give you a scenario.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.522
Let's say you and your man
taking a walk.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.125
Beautiful day outside.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.565
You look at
your man, you say,

32:22.640 --> 32:25.962
"Babe, I love you more today
than I did yesterday."

32:26.040 --> 32:27.246
Out of nowhere,

32:27.320 --> 32:31.041
an orangutan hops the fence,
attacks your man.

32:31.640 --> 32:34.769
The orangutan
takes his kneecaps.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.606
He can never do
this again in life.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.926
He is straight-legged
for the rest of his life.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.764
You can deal with
this right here?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.048
This ain't gonna
fuck with you every day?

32:48.360 --> 32:50.169
Every goddamn day,
this ain't gonna fuck with you?

32:50.280 --> 32:51.691
Looking at this?

32:52.560 --> 32:54.403
Butt-ass naked,
going to the bathroom like this.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.244
This ain't gonna fuck with you?

32:56.320 --> 32:58.448
You a goddamn liar.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.285
One of those days,
you're gonna fucking snap.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.250
"If you don't go sit your
straight-legged ass down...

33:05.120 --> 33:08.329
"Walking all straight
all over the fucking house!

33:08.400 --> 33:10.641
"Sit your
no-knee-bending ass down!"

33:11.880 --> 33:15.851
You're gonna get mad 'cause you still
wanna do knee-bending shit.

33:16.360 --> 33:21.241
"Hey, babe! Babe!
We still going bowling on Tuesday?"

33:22.920 --> 33:25.321
All your friends hate
when you bring him

33:25.440 --> 33:27.442
'cause he takes
too long to bowl.

33:41.760 --> 33:42.761
They get mad.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.525
"I can't stand when
she brings his ass!

33:45.600 --> 33:48.683
"He can never relax.
He's so uptight!"

33:48.760 --> 33:49.727
You get mad.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.968
"I can't relax
'cause I ain't got no knees!

33:52.040 --> 33:53.610
"I got attacked by an orangutan!"

33:54.360 --> 33:56.931
Your black girlfriend'll be there.
She'll never believe shit.

33:57.240 --> 34:02.644
"An orangutan? Really?"

34:04.120 --> 34:06.851
That's my "black girl
don't believe shit" face.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.129
"Orangutan?

34:10.440 --> 34:12.408
"Really?"

34:14.040 --> 34:15.405
Why is that?

34:15.480 --> 34:18.051
Why don't black women believe shit?
What happened?

34:18.639 --> 34:20.449
What happened?

34:20.520 --> 34:23.330
You can't convince
a black woman of shit.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.047
"Hey, babe.
Babe, don't walk over there.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.770
"It's real slippery
right there."

34:27.840 --> 34:31.208
"Slippery?

34:31.280 --> 34:34.409
"Really?"

34:34.480 --> 34:37.085
She walk over there anyway,
trips, falls, hits her head.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.766
"Oh, my God,
it's slippery over here.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.322
"They need to put a sign up."

34:42.400 --> 34:46.849
"Bitch, I just told you,
it was fucking slippery over there."

34:47.199 --> 34:50.681
"Did you tell me?

34:50.760 --> 34:53.047
"Really?"

34:54.800 --> 34:57.610
Could you still have sex with the guy
that can't bend his knees?

34:58.520 --> 35:00.807
If he was aggressive about it?

35:00.880 --> 35:02.245
That's an honest question.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.085
Could you have sex with a guy
that can't bend his knees?

35:05.840 --> 35:09.765
"Hey! Hey!

35:09.840 --> 35:13.003
"Get over here and get some of
this lock-knee dick."

35:20.840 --> 35:24.731
"Don't run!
Don't run! Don't run!"

35:27.800 --> 35:31.043
It look like he be skiing on your ass,
that's what it look like.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.566
When he cums, it looks like he jumped
a big-ass ski ramp.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.286
Oh!

35:40.960 --> 35:42.371
Look at all the black women.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.966
"Ski ramp?

35:45.080 --> 35:48.084
"Really?"

35:54.480 --> 35:57.051
Oh! Stop it. Cut it out.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.122
Stop trying to
make me feel tall.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.049
This is how I think, people.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.043
I'm a drastic thinker.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.326
I'm not worse
than my lady, though.

36:06.400 --> 36:10.689
My lady is the queen
of hypothetical thoughts.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.166
You know what I feel like?

36:12.240 --> 36:14.846
I feel like all women
suffer from this disease.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.524
Women love to
ask men questions

36:16.600 --> 36:18.648
about shit that
would never happen.

36:18.720 --> 36:19.881
You love it.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.362
"Babe, babe,
what would you do if...

36:24.480 --> 36:28.769
"Babe, babe, hypothetically speaking,
but not really, but if it did,

36:28.840 --> 36:30.444
"what could might be, huh?"

36:31.240 --> 36:32.605
You love it.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.045
True story right now.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.963
Me and my lady,
we're on a boat. Right?

36:37.040 --> 36:40.328
We're on a boat.
We hit a wave.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.051
She go, "Oh, my God, babe,
what if we would've hit that wave,

36:43.120 --> 36:45.566
"and I would've fell out
the boat in the middle of the ocean,

36:45.680 --> 36:48.081
"and then a shark would've started
swimming around me?

36:48.160 --> 36:49.286
"What would you do?"

36:51.800 --> 36:53.370
"I'ma get the camera
and start taping.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.766
"Some shit about to go down.
I don't know."

36:56.400 --> 36:58.402
"Stop being an asshole
and answer the question!"

36:58.480 --> 36:59.686
"What do you mean,
answer the question?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.445
"It's a shark."

37:01.520 --> 37:04.729
Like, I don't know who she wants me
to be in her head.

37:04.800 --> 37:09.089
Like, what Nigga is that tough
that he sees a shark and goes,

37:09.160 --> 37:11.049
"I'm sick of this shark shit!"

37:11.120 --> 37:14.124
And jumps in the water
to fight the shark?

37:14.200 --> 37:16.168
I'm not that guy.
I don't have that muscle.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.564
She said, "Well, what if
the shark attacked me,

37:19.640 --> 37:22.120
"but I got away,
and I swam back to the boat?"

37:22.200 --> 37:25.249
I said, "That would never happen.
What kind of attack was this?"

37:26.160 --> 37:28.208
She said, "What do you mean?"
"What do you mean, what do I mean?"

37:28.280 --> 37:30.487
"What kind of attack was this?
What did the shark get?"

37:30.720 --> 37:33.200
She said, "The shark bit off
one leg, one arm."

37:36.320 --> 37:41.690
"The shark bit off one leg and one arm,
and you swam back to the boat?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.922
"That's what you're telling me?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.525
"Was it on the same side?

37:46.520 --> 37:48.284
"'Cause on the same side,
you're just gonna go in a circle.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.761
"This is all you're gonna do right here,
is one big-ass circle.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.126
"You ain't going no-fucking-where."

37:53.640 --> 37:55.802
"Stop being an asshole, Kevin,
and answer the question."

37:56.920 --> 38:00.288
"I can't answer the question
if you don't make the question make sense."

38:00.360 --> 38:02.328
She said, "Fine.
Alternate the sides.

38:02.400 --> 38:05.290
"He bit one leg on this side,
one arm on this side."

38:05.360 --> 38:06.691
I said, "So, what, you wanna know

38:06.760 --> 38:08.285
"what I would say when
you got back to the boat?"

38:08.360 --> 38:10.169
She said, "Yeah.
What would you say?"

38:10.720 --> 38:12.722
"Well, who else is on the boat?"

38:13.560 --> 38:16.882
She said, "It's just us.
It's nobody else on the boat. Just us."

38:17.960 --> 38:18.961
"Okay, let me get this straight.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.690
"You get attacked by the shark,

38:20.760 --> 38:22.967
"shark bites off one leg, one arm,

38:23.040 --> 38:25.247
"you swim back to the boat,

38:25.680 --> 38:28.206
"you climb up on the boat,

38:28.920 --> 38:31.844
"you're standing in
front of me on one leg,

38:33.360 --> 38:36.091
"it's nobody else
on the boat, nobody else.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.168
"If it's nobody
else on the boat,

38:40.360 --> 38:42.727
"I'ma push you back in.
I'ma push you back in.

38:44.480 --> 38:49.520
"Shark gotta finish that. He gotta finish that.
I'm not going home with that.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.841
"I didn't leave with that.
Why do I have to go home with that?

38:51.920 --> 38:53.843
"That's not what I left with.

38:53.920 --> 38:57.322
"The shark gotta clean that plate.
Clean that plate, Mr. Shark."

38:58.320 --> 39:00.129
That's what my mom tell me,
"Finish your food.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.850
"You better finish that fucking food."

39:04.080 --> 39:07.368
Y'all can think I'm an asshole all you want.
This is how I think, man.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.807
I told you, I'm a drastic thinker.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.281
This is why I told
my family we need to move.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.522
I'm not the father
for the environment that we live in.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.204
I'm not.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.089
Good thing about my family
is we table everything.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.322
Everything is up for discussion.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.562
I told my son, I said, "Look.
I told you I wanna move.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.051
"Tell me why you wanna stay."

39:24.120 --> 39:25.201
My son told me flat-out,

39:25.280 --> 39:27.886
"Dad, I don't wanna move
because I don't wanna leave my room."

39:27.960 --> 39:29.041
I get it.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.531
I went all out for my son's room.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.921
My son used to be into Spider-Man,
now he's into Batman.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.766
So I went out, I got his whole room
painted as Gotham City.

39:36.840 --> 39:40.561
I put the bat symbol on the wall.
His bed is the Batmobile.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.449
Batman is on the actual ceiling.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.410
When my son first saw
the room, he went off.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.602
"Dad!"

39:50.680 --> 39:52.045
He was like, "I love it!"

39:55.840 --> 39:58.161
I told you all, private schools
are fucking my kids up.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.480
They are.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.484
My son has a lot of white friends.
They got real long hair.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.767
So my son gets excited,
he does this shit.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.930
Listen, listen to me.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.764
It makes me so mad.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.080
Do you understand me?

40:10.160 --> 40:13.004
This shit makes me
so fucking mad.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.651
The reason why is because
his hair looks just like mine.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.085
It's just like mine.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.321
So I'm like,
"What are you doing?"

40:18.400 --> 40:19.765
He was like,
"I couldn't see you."

40:19.840 --> 40:21.922
"Bitch, you see me.
Don't...

40:22.000 --> 40:23.764
"Don't do that.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.251
"You see me.
I'm right here.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.169
"Don't act like
you can't see me."

40:28.720 --> 40:32.088
He was like, "I just wanna play."
"Fine, go. Go play."

40:32.200 --> 40:34.282
My son goes in his room,
he plays all day.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.646
All day.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.721
It's time for bed.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.087
I say, "Go in there,
brush your teeth, wash your face, get into bed.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.286
"I'ma kiss you good night."

40:40.360 --> 40:42.567
My son gets into bed,
I kiss my son good night,

40:42.640 --> 40:44.290
I cut out the lights, I walk out.

40:44.360 --> 40:47.011
When I walk out,
I hear a bunch of screaming.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.924
"No!

40:50.080 --> 40:52.731
"Don't do it, Batman, please!"
What the fuck?

40:54.080 --> 40:55.923
I go running back in the room.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.801
I run back in the room,
this woman made Batman glow in the dark.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.405
So Batman...

41:03.080 --> 41:04.366
Batman...

41:05.240 --> 41:07.447
Batman looked like
he was about to rape my son.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.443
He was just staring at my son.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.768
Hey, I'm not gonna lie,
I got scared.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.491
I said, "Get the fuck out
of the bed!

41:15.200 --> 41:17.168
"Get out the bed before
he swoop down on your ass

41:17.240 --> 41:19.971
"and I can't do
nothing about it!"

41:20.080 --> 41:22.560
I can't beat Batman.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.601
My daughter said, "Dad, I don't wanna move
because I love the space."

41:27.680 --> 41:29.205
My daughter's favorite game
to play at the house,

41:29.280 --> 41:30.691
she loves to hide from people,

41:30.800 --> 41:33.406
wait for you to walk by,
jump out and scare you.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.284
This girl's patience
is unbelievable.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.850
I've never seen anything like it.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.161
Like, I've seen
my daughter go hide,

41:41.240 --> 41:43.846
but then I forgot that
she went to go hide.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.651
So, like, five,
six hours go by.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.529
I finally walk by,
she jumps out,

41:48.600 --> 41:50.762
but she's too weak
to scare me.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.367
"What took you so long, Daddy?

41:56.680 --> 41:58.409
"I haven't eaten anything all day.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.970
"I'm so hungry.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.725
"My lips are dry, they're bleeding.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.848
"I need some water right now,
I swear to God."

42:05.880 --> 42:08.042
My kids are characters,

42:08.120 --> 42:10.441
but my kids are my best friends.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.885
Honestly, they're my best friends.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.928
I love the fact that
me and my kids talk.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.001
We communicate.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.161
Now, I'm not gonna lie.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.720
I'm not gonna act like it's all perfect,
because it's not.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.211
We butt heads.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.487
I recently got mad at my kids

42:22.600 --> 42:24.568
because I feel like my kids
don't put a lot of thought

42:24.640 --> 42:25.801
into the gifts
that they give me.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.484
This shit pisses me off.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.561
I'm serious,
they're making me mad.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.005
I go all out for my kids.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.570
So I feel like when it's time to do
something for me,

42:31.640 --> 42:33.847
put the same time,
energy and effort into it

42:33.920 --> 42:35.490
that I do when
I do shit for you.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.721
This is what made me mad.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.929
For my birthday,
my son gave me a handprint.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.527
This boy dipped his hand in paint,
put it on a piece of paper,

42:43.600 --> 42:45.762
said, "Happy birthday, Dad.
Love, Hendrix."

42:45.840 --> 42:47.080
Came home excited.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.322
"Dad, I got you something
for your birthday.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.129
"You're gonna love it.
Close your eyes."

42:51.200 --> 42:52.486
I close my eyes.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.324
I'm emotional, I start crying.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.481
"Boy, don't do this to me.

42:55.560 --> 42:56.891
"Don't do this.

42:56.960 --> 42:57.961
"Not today.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.610
"Don't do it today.
What is it?"

42:59.720 --> 43:01.404
He said, "Open your eyes.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.721
"Happy birthday, Dad.
I did this because I love you."

43:03.800 --> 43:06.326
I looked at it, I said,
"I'm gonna be honest with you, son.

43:06.400 --> 43:07.811
"I don't really feel like you do.

43:07.880 --> 43:11.248
"I don't think this is a good representation of
your level of love for me.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.446
"This is a shitty gift.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.488
"It's a fucked-up gift."

43:14.560 --> 43:15.971
Out of the corner of my eye,

43:16.040 --> 43:20.489
I saw my daughter pushing a macaroni plate
back down into her book bag.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.561
I saw her.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.847
I said, "What the fuck is that?"
She looked me in the eye.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.161
"Mmm, trying to figure it out.
I don't know yet.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.049
"I don't know what
I want it to be."

43:29.120 --> 43:30.770
Now, I'm not gonna
lie to y'all and say

43:30.840 --> 43:31.966
I didn't hold a grudge,
because I did.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.849
I held a grudge.

43:33.920 --> 43:37.322
I held a grudge all the way up
until my son's birthday.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.607
My son's birthday came,
he woke up, he was hyped.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.609
"Dad! You know what today is?"

43:41.720 --> 43:43.245
"I sure do, son, it's your birthday.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.049
"We gonna turn up
like we always do."

43:45.120 --> 43:46.929
My son goes to school,
gets home.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.843
When he gets home,
I got a bunch of presents

43:48.920 --> 43:51.844
wrapped up in boxes
laid all out on the bed.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.081
He opens 'em up.

43:53.160 --> 43:57.961
I had 57 handprints
in all the boxes.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.846
He saw it,
he starts crying.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.649
He was like,
"What is this?"

44:01.720 --> 44:04.485
I said, "Those are high fives.

44:04.560 --> 44:05.800
"I got you high fives."

44:05.880 --> 44:07.928
He said,
"But I didn't ask for these."

44:08.040 --> 44:10.486
I said, "Neither did I."

44:12.040 --> 44:14.202
You selfish son of a bitch.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.331
You better be lucky
I didn't take a picture

44:16.400 --> 44:17.811
of my ass and put it
in that box,

44:17.880 --> 44:20.531
tell you to kiss my fucking ass,
that's what I should've did.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.481
"I should've let Batman
rape you." I said that.

44:23.560 --> 44:24.971
Swear to God, I said that.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.963
I know it's wrong,
but I said it.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.849
When I really wanna
piss my kids off,

44:30.920 --> 44:33.526
I let my dad
spend time with them.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.011
That's how I really
get to them.

44:35.080 --> 44:36.047
Here's the thing.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.600
My kids love their grandpop,
they really do.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.170
They just don't like to be
with him for too long

44:40.280 --> 44:42.203
'cause my dad is too loud.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.284
It's like the older you get,
the louder you get.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.691
This isn't even a joke.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.728
This is how my dad
walks in my house.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.290
This is his entrance.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.201
"Where the babies at?

44:52.280 --> 44:55.727
"Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! Ho!"

44:56.120 --> 44:58.521
That's his entrance.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.682
It's at the point now
where I can't even

45:00.800 --> 45:02.928
let my dad watch
my kids by himself.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.402
I gotta watch my dad
while he watches my kids.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.766
'Cause he does too
many stupid things.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.730
I caught my dad giving my kids
raw candy out of his pocket.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.040
Candy with no wrapper.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.087
It was loose.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.207
It was just in his pocket.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.601
He said, "Huh, huh,
y'all want one of these?"

45:16.680 --> 45:18.603
"What the fuck is that?
What are they?"

45:18.680 --> 45:22.366
He said, "Peppermints."
"Ain't no goddamn peppermint.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.250
"Where the lines at
on that peppermint?"

45:25.320 --> 45:27.368
He said, "My jeans must have rubbed it off."
"Nigga!

45:28.440 --> 45:31.330
"You're not about to give my kids
no jean-dyed peppermint!"

45:32.560 --> 45:33.766
"Fine, more for me."

45:33.840 --> 45:36.207
Takes the peppermint out of his pocket,
puts it in his mouth.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.089
Five minutes go by,
I saw my dad take

45:38.160 --> 45:39.685
that peppermint
out of his mouth,

45:39.760 --> 45:41.125
put it back in his pocket.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.090
Those were half-sucked
on peppermints!

45:45.360 --> 45:47.886
He's not gonna give my kids
no goddamn suck-and-saves.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.530
That's a suck-and-save!

45:50.160 --> 45:51.491
That's an old people trick.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.967
Old people love to
suck on candy and save it.

45:54.040 --> 45:55.724
"I'ma save this
till after church."

45:55.800 --> 45:58.201
"Nana, eat that fucking candy!

45:58.280 --> 45:59.964
"Little piece of
candy left, Grandma.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.690
"Eat that fucking candy!"

46:03.480 --> 46:04.641
My dad is a character.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.206
The shit that
I'm telling you,
you can't make up.

46:08.520 --> 46:11.285
I bought my dad an iPhone 6 for
his birthday.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.203
I've never seen
my dad use the phone.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.281
Never.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.886
He comes downstairs one day,
he goes, "Hey!

46:17.000 --> 46:18.889
"I wanna take the kids
to go get some pizza."

46:18.960 --> 46:20.166
I said, "First of all,
you're not going anywhere

46:20.240 --> 46:21.605
"with my kids
by yourself.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.569
"We can go as a group."

46:23.640 --> 46:25.449
I said, "Where you wanna go?"
This is true shit.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.124
You cannot make this up.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.168
My dad takes his phone out of
his back pocket,

46:29.240 --> 46:30.651
this is what I hear,

46:31.720 --> 46:35.122
"Cyrus, where is
the closest pizza spot?"

46:41.360 --> 46:42.691
"What did you just say?"

46:42.760 --> 46:45.047
"Cyrus, where you at?

46:45.120 --> 46:46.121
"Talk to me.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.208
"Looking for a pizza spot.
Wake up.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.770
"Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up."

46:49.840 --> 46:51.251
He starts shaking the phone.

46:51.320 --> 46:53.926
"Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up."

46:54.040 --> 46:57.123
My dad thinks there's a Nigga
living in the phone!

47:00.360 --> 47:01.771
"It's 'Siri', you dumb bitch!

47:01.880 --> 47:02.961
"'Siri'!

47:03.560 --> 47:05.562
"Not goddamn Cyrus."

47:08.560 --> 47:10.449
He's a character.

47:10.520 --> 47:12.249
I love him, though.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.322
Hates the fact that
I don't whup my kids.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.765
Hates it.

47:15.840 --> 47:18.081
My dad is old school,
old generation.

47:18.160 --> 47:21.164
Old generation believes
in whupping the kid's ass.

47:21.240 --> 47:22.526
That's all they believe in.

47:22.600 --> 47:24.807
It's not that I don't.
It's not that I don't.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.405
I don't want y'all
to think that I don't.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.086
I just don't feel like
I need to whup my kid's ass.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.009
My voice is enough.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.481
"Shut the fuck up!"
That's enough.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.721
Private school kids,
they get scared fast.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.684
"Dad's going crazy again!

47:45.800 --> 47:48.485
"Let's go to our secret spot!"
Private school kids.

47:50.320 --> 47:51.765
I'm not gonna lie
to y'all.

47:51.840 --> 47:54.889
It does piss me off
that my kids
don't have any edge.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.689
I want my kids
to have edge.

47:56.760 --> 47:57.886
But they're not.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.962
I'm not a thug,
I'm not a killer, people.

48:00.040 --> 48:01.963
But I got some edge to me.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.520
You need edge to
survive in life.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.361
My kids aren't
gonna have that edge.

48:06.440 --> 48:09.410
The reason why is because
they're growing up different than I grew up.

48:09.480 --> 48:11.289
My son definitely doesn't have it.

48:11.360 --> 48:12.805
I gave up.
I don't even give a shit.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.370
It is what it is.

48:14.440 --> 48:15.566
Swear to God,
it is what it is.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.290
I'ma tell you
the day that I gave up.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.051
The day that I gave up,

48:19.120 --> 48:21.407
I got some of my friends
over to my house
that I grew up with.

48:21.480 --> 48:22.766
We're in the kitchen,

48:22.840 --> 48:26.322
we're having a thug-like
conversation about our pasts.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.440
"Yo, Kev.

48:28.520 --> 48:29.851
"You remember
when Ronald got shot

48:29.920 --> 48:32.287
"in the back of the head?"
"God damn, I do.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.407
"I really do.

48:33.480 --> 48:34.891
"Died on the spot."

48:34.960 --> 48:35.927
"What about Terry?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.047
"You remember Terry
got shot in the back?"

48:37.120 --> 48:39.088
"Fuck! I remember that."

48:39.160 --> 48:41.766
I hear my son
coming down the steps.

48:41.840 --> 48:44.047
I hear his flip-flops popping.

48:45.440 --> 48:47.204
They're popping fast.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.170
So that means he's walking
with a purpose.

48:49.280 --> 48:50.486
Something's wrong.

48:50.560 --> 48:53.325
He gets downstairs,
he got an attitude.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.006
"Dad!

49:01.200 --> 49:02.725
"Wi-Fi's down!"

49:05.880 --> 49:07.689
What the fuck?

49:07.760 --> 49:09.046
What?

49:09.120 --> 49:10.531
"Well, you want me
to reboot it?

49:10.600 --> 49:13.331
"'Cause nobody else
seems to care."

49:13.400 --> 49:15.721
"Go! Go, reboot it, man. Go."

49:15.800 --> 49:17.962
"I'm thirsty,
could I have a Capri Sun?"

49:18.040 --> 49:19.724
"Son, get the fuck out
of my face.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.245
"Just go. Go!

49:21.320 --> 49:22.560
"Them tight-ass pajamas.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.051
"Take your ass upstairs. Go.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.727
"And put on some
loose pajamas!"

49:28.120 --> 49:30.885
Now, I don't know
what made me more upset.

49:30.960 --> 49:33.088
That, or my friend going,

49:34.200 --> 49:36.567
"Who the fuck is Wi-Fi?"

49:38.440 --> 49:41.250
I said,
"What did you just say?"

49:41.320 --> 49:43.607
"I'm saying, he said that
they're gonna reboot it.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.205
"If they're strapped,
we're strapped.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.044
"I'ma die for mines."

49:48.560 --> 49:50.847
"What the fuck are
you talking about, man?

49:50.920 --> 49:52.570
"It's the Internet,
jackass!

49:52.640 --> 49:54.324
"It's the Internet!"

49:54.400 --> 49:55.526
"Well, you need
to say something,

49:55.600 --> 49:57.523
"'cause we almost
lost a life today."

49:57.640 --> 49:58.971
"Whose life?

49:59.520 --> 50:01.090
"You was gonna kill my son?"

50:02.200 --> 50:04.328
"Depending on
what side he was on."

50:04.400 --> 50:05.401
What?

50:09.400 --> 50:12.370
My dad called me
over the holidays.

50:12.440 --> 50:13.805
"Hey!

50:13.880 --> 50:14.927
"I miss you.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.241
"I miss you,
I miss them babies.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.685
"I wanna come see y'all."

50:18.760 --> 50:21.684
I said, "Dad, all you gotta do is
tell me when, I'll put you on a plane."

50:21.760 --> 50:24.127
He said, "Well, I wanna
bring Connie with me."

50:24.200 --> 50:26.521
"Dad, you wanna bring Connie,
you can bring Connie."

50:26.600 --> 50:27.931
"Well, before I bring her,
I need to know

50:28.000 --> 50:31.721
"if your house is
wheelchair accessible."

50:34.960 --> 50:37.008
"Well, Dad, nobody
in my house is in a wheelchair,

50:37.080 --> 50:38.809
"so I never felt the need

50:38.880 --> 50:41.724
"to wheelchair-accessorize
my home."

50:41.800 --> 50:43.245
"Well, you need to get it right.

50:43.320 --> 50:44.970
"Connie's in
a wheelchair now."

50:45.040 --> 50:46.371
"What the fuck happened to Connie?

50:46.480 --> 50:47.925
"Why is Connie in a wheelchair?"

50:48.000 --> 50:49.889
"It's a long story.

50:49.960 --> 50:52.122
"She got hit by a car."

50:52.200 --> 50:54.407
"Okay, first of all,
you just told the story.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.562
"It wasn't that long at all.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.848
"Second of all,
how'd she get hit by a car?

50:59.920 --> 51:00.887
"What happened?"

51:00.960 --> 51:03.850
"Look, boy, I ain't got time
to talk to you about that.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.287
"I was driving, she was in the street,
it was raining.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.124
"Legally, I can't talk about it

51:08.200 --> 51:09.565
"'cause the case is still open."

51:09.640 --> 51:10.801
"The case?

51:11.800 --> 51:13.484
"You got a case?"

51:14.560 --> 51:17.131
"Look, boy, just get
some wheelchair shit for the house."

51:17.200 --> 51:18.804
"Fine."

51:18.880 --> 51:21.121
I don't know what
wheelchair shit is, people.

51:21.200 --> 51:24.044
I have no idea what
wheelchair shit is.

51:24.920 --> 51:26.081
True story.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.003
I went out, I bought
a handicapped sign,

51:28.080 --> 51:29.206
I put it in the driveway.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.089
True story, swear to God.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.481
'Cause that way, when they pull up,
I look like I support.

51:33.560 --> 51:34.891
Like, hey.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.530
Hey.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.851
Look who's welcome here.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.285
Like, hey.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.769
They get there,

51:42.840 --> 51:45.605
my dad takes the wheelchair out of the car,
puts Connie in the wheelchair.

51:45.680 --> 51:47.887
He rolls Connie in the house.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.764
Connie gets in the house,
she goes off.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.729
"Oh, my God!

51:51.800 --> 51:53.768
"I love it! I love it!

51:53.880 --> 51:55.325
"I wanna see
the whole house!"

51:55.400 --> 51:58.802
She says, "Spoon, push me all over
so I can see everything."

51:58.880 --> 52:00.882
My dad snapped. "No!

52:00.960 --> 52:02.007
"No!

52:02.520 --> 52:05.683
"Sick of this pushing shit!"
That's what he said.

52:06.960 --> 52:10.487
"I've been pushing your ass all over
the place all goddamn day.

52:10.560 --> 52:13.211
"Wherever I sit you is
where you're gonna have to stay

52:13.280 --> 52:15.362
"until I feel like
moving you again."

52:15.440 --> 52:17.090
I said, "What?

52:17.480 --> 52:20.006
"Why can't she just
roll around the house by herself?"

52:20.080 --> 52:21.491
He said, "'Cause
when I sit her down,

52:21.560 --> 52:24.564
"I'ma lock the back brakes
so she can't move."

52:26.120 --> 52:28.327
"For what?"
"Because I love her!

52:28.400 --> 52:30.801
"And I don't want her
rolling out of my life, that's why."

52:30.880 --> 52:32.120
"Okay, all right, stop.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.806
"Everybody, stop. Stop."

52:35.760 --> 52:38.730
I said, "Look,
y'all just landed, man.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.569
"Everybody's a little bit on edge.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.641
"This is what we're gonna do.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.000
"We're gonna have a family night.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.208
"I'ma order some food,
we're gonna watch a movie.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.406
"That's what we're gonna do."

52:46.480 --> 52:49.848
I order some food, I say,
"Connie, go in the other room.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.331
"Go pick out a movie
you wanna watch."

52:51.400 --> 52:53.607
Connie goes in the room,
she picks out a movie.

52:53.680 --> 52:54.681
She comes back.

52:54.760 --> 52:58.446
The movie she picked out
was called The Conjuring.

52:58.520 --> 53:01.330
For those people here tonight
who do not know what The Conjuring is,

53:01.400 --> 53:03.801
The Conjuring is a scary-ass movie

53:03.880 --> 53:05.530
that came out a long time ago.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.285
I said, "Connie, I don't think
it's a good idea for us to watch that

53:08.360 --> 53:10.567
"because of everything
that's been going onmaround the house."

53:10.640 --> 53:12.005
My dad says, "Stop being a bitch."

53:12.080 --> 53:13.525
I said, "No, Dad, I'm serious.

53:13.600 --> 53:17.525
"A raccoon shot at me twice,
grabbed his dick, disappeared into the dark.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.045
"I don't have lights in my driveway."

53:19.120 --> 53:20.929
He said, "Stop being a bitch!

53:21.000 --> 53:22.126
"Connie wants to
watch the movie,

53:22.200 --> 53:24.089
"we're gonna watch the movie." Fine.

53:24.160 --> 53:25.844
We watch The Conjuring.

53:25.920 --> 53:28.127
After the movie's over,
it did exactly what I thought it would do,

53:28.200 --> 53:29.565
scared the shit out of me.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.405
My dad and Connie,
they wanna go upstairs
and they wanna go to sleep.

53:32.840 --> 53:36.890
Me and my dad pick Connie
in the wheelchair up, carry her upstairs,

53:36.960 --> 53:39.486
Connie and my dad
get into bed, they go to sleep.

53:39.560 --> 53:41.722
Me and my lady get into bed,
my lady goes to sleep.

53:41.800 --> 53:42.961
I'm up.

53:43.480 --> 53:45.050
I can't go to sleep,

53:45.120 --> 53:47.885
'cause I got The Conjuring
on my mind.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.721
I hear this in the hallway.

54:14.880 --> 54:18.851
Every man in this room tonight
has done this at least once.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.126
"Hey, babe, are you up?

54:30.200 --> 54:32.248
"I just heard some shit
in the hallway."

54:34.800 --> 54:35.961
"No, I'm asleep.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.644
"Just go see what it is."

54:39.080 --> 54:41.686
"Go put some shoes on
so you can go see what it is with me,

54:41.760 --> 54:43.649
"so we can both go see what it is."

54:43.720 --> 54:44.960
"Stop, Kevin, I'm asleep.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.963
"Just go see what it is."

54:50.480 --> 54:51.606
I hear it again.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.931
You ever get so scared that you don't know
where to put your hands at?

55:07.080 --> 55:08.684
"All right!

55:09.760 --> 55:12.161
"Don't make me come out there!

55:12.240 --> 55:14.242
"'Cause if I get out there,
I'ma be there!"

55:14.640 --> 55:16.244
I don't even know what that means.
I was scared.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.004
It was the first thing
that came to my mind.

55:18.080 --> 55:21.562
She said, "Stop yelling at my ear,
just go see what it is."

55:21.640 --> 55:23.290
"Well, you're up.
It don't look like you're asleep,

55:23.360 --> 55:25.169
"so you should come with me.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.004
"Fine, fine. I'll go by myself."

55:27.080 --> 55:30.482
I sleep naked, so I had to get up,
I had to put a robe on.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.130
I grabbed my robe,

55:32.560 --> 55:35.450
I start scared-walking
towards the hallway.

55:36.760 --> 55:39.286
Scared-walking is
when you're walking,

55:39.360 --> 55:42.170
but you're leaning
backwards just in case...

55:43.520 --> 55:44.806
Just in case
some shit goes down,

55:44.880 --> 55:46.848
you can get the fuck up
out of there real quick.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.285
It's quick.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.489
I'm scared-walking.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.765
Scared-walking.

55:53.920 --> 55:55.081
I get to the hallway.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.128
As soon as I get to the hallway,
I cut the lights on.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.085
I don't what it is, people act like

56:01.160 --> 56:03.322
lights can stop a murder. Like...

56:04.040 --> 56:06.611
Like a murderer will
see lights and be like,

56:06.680 --> 56:08.091
"Man, I was about to
stab you in the neck,

56:08.160 --> 56:10.527
"but you got these fucking lights on,
I ain't gonna do it now."

56:10.600 --> 56:12.967
They don't give
a shit about lights.

56:13.040 --> 56:14.804
I start scared-walking
down this way.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.166
Scared-walking.

56:16.240 --> 56:17.969
I'm scared-walking.

56:18.920 --> 56:20.490
Scared-walking.

56:21.520 --> 56:25.127
Out of nowhere, my daughter jumps
from behind the wall.

56:30.560 --> 56:31.891
Listen to me.

56:31.960 --> 56:35.407
Scared the living shit
out of me.

56:36.440 --> 56:39.842
All I can tell y'all is that she learned
from her past mistakes.

56:39.920 --> 56:43.402
She had a canteen on this hip,

56:44.800 --> 56:47.929
she had a fanny pack
on this hip with snacks and shit.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.401
I don't know how long
she was there,

56:50.480 --> 56:53.086
but it had to be for a long time.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.083
I was so scared,
I turned around,

56:55.160 --> 56:57.083
I jumped down my flight of steps.

56:57.160 --> 56:58.969
I got 15 steps in my house.

56:59.040 --> 57:00.724
I just jumped.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.804
When I jumped,
the air got the best of my robe,

57:03.880 --> 57:05.086
it blew my robe up.

57:05.160 --> 57:07.527
My dick, my ass, everything is out.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.762
Somehow my car keys fall in my hand.

57:11.840 --> 57:12.966
Don't know how.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.530
I don't really care.

57:14.600 --> 57:17.171
I land,
I run out the front door,

57:17.240 --> 57:20.403
get in my car, start the car up,
I start laughing.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.369
I start dying laughing.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.682
The reason why I was laughing is because

57:24.760 --> 57:27.650
I realized that I don't give a fuck
about my family.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.609
I was like, "I don't care.

57:29.680 --> 57:32.047
"I don't care!

57:32.680 --> 57:33.761
"I don't care!"

57:33.840 --> 57:35.604
I didn't go wake my son up.

57:35.720 --> 57:37.370
I didn't go check on my lady.

57:37.440 --> 57:39.124
To be 100% honest
with you all,

57:39.200 --> 57:41.362
I don't even know
if that was my daughter or not.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.842
In my mind, that was the little bitch
from The Conjuring

57:44.920 --> 57:47.082
that was clapping at everybody
goddamn near her.

57:48.560 --> 57:50.881
I turn around and
back out the driveway,

57:51.200 --> 57:55.683
my dad is sitting in
the backseat of the car.

57:58.040 --> 58:01.362
I said, "What the fuck
is going on here?"

58:01.440 --> 58:03.169
My dad goes...

58:05.400 --> 58:07.084
"Did you hear that shit?"

58:07.600 --> 58:09.329
I said, "What?"

58:10.360 --> 58:12.601
"Did you hear that shit?

58:13.560 --> 58:15.403
"We gotta get
the fuck outta here!"

58:17.160 --> 58:18.764
I said, "What about Connie?"

58:18.840 --> 58:20.205
He said, "What about her?

58:20.280 --> 58:23.762
"I can't carry
that goddamn chair
downstairs by myself!

58:24.240 --> 58:25.685
"I locked the back brakes.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.250
"The back brakes are jammed.

58:27.320 --> 58:29.561
"I can't get the back brakes unjammed.

58:29.920 --> 58:32.002
"We gotta get the fuck
outta here right now!"

58:33.280 --> 58:34.884
I said, "If you was that scared,

58:34.960 --> 58:36.530
"then why didn't you leave already?"

58:36.600 --> 58:39.604
He said, "Cause a raccoon
kept coming to the car

58:39.680 --> 58:41.682
"going 'bang, bang,'
and then he grabbed his dick,

58:41.760 --> 58:42.921
"disappeared into the dark.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.646
"We gotta get the fuck
outta here right now!"

58:45.720 --> 58:49.441
He pulled out his iPhone
and he said, "Cyrus, wake your ass up!

58:49.520 --> 58:51.727
"Get my ass up
outta here right now!

58:51.840 --> 58:54.571
"We ain't got time for you
to be fucking asleep, Cyrus."

58:54.640 --> 58:57.291
"It's Siri,
you dumb bitch. Siri."

59:02.080 --> 59:04.208
The toughest part about that night

59:04.280 --> 59:06.282
was the next morning
when I got back home.

59:09.720 --> 59:10.881
Oh! Oh, no, we left!

59:10.960 --> 59:12.007
I'm sorry, I forgot.

59:12.080 --> 59:13.605
Yeah, we left.

59:14.120 --> 59:16.930
Me and my dad made
an executive decision to save ourselves.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.411
We got the fuck up outta there.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.482
The reason why the next morning
was so tough

59:22.560 --> 59:25.404
'cause as soon as I walked in the house,
my lady was in the kitchen.

59:25.480 --> 59:27.642
She was like, "Where did you go last night?"
And I told her,

59:27.720 --> 59:29.324
I was like, "I left."

59:29.400 --> 59:31.084
She said, "What do you mean, you left?"

59:31.160 --> 59:33.049
I was like, "I left. I saved myself.

59:33.120 --> 59:34.565
"The only reason why I came back

59:34.640 --> 59:36.324
"is because I didn't see
anything on the news

59:36.400 --> 59:38.004
"so I knew you were still alive."

59:38.920 --> 59:40.081
I told the truth.

59:40.440 --> 59:41.521
I did.

59:41.640 --> 59:44.120
The reason why I told
the truth is because I told myself

59:44.200 --> 59:46.009
that I'm not gonna lie anymore.

59:46.080 --> 59:50.483
The only way I'll lie is if the truth
doesn't sound believable.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.005
Ladies, please, please
try to understand that.

59:55.080 --> 59:57.082
That doesn't mean
I was out cheating or fucking.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.811
It means that whatever I was doing
just doesn't sound right

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.291
when I say it out loud.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.442
That's it.
That's all it means.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.931
Everybody that
follows me knows

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.446
that all my comedy
comes from a real place.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.682
First and foremost,
understand that I'm older now.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.761
I'm 36.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.330
My friends are older than me.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.846
42, 46, 47, 48.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.844
We go out,
we do older guy shit.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.964
Me and my friends go to a lounge,
this is a true story.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.288
When we get to the lounge,
for some reason,

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.284
we're watching ping-pong on TV.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.202
We are locked in to this ping-pong match.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.725
Outta nowhere, my friend Joey goes,

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.848
"You'd better be lucky
we don't have a ping-pong table.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.491
"If we did, I would
bust all y'all's ass."

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.971
I said, "Bet money, bitch."

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.565
That's me and my friends'
biggest problem.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.801
We're competitive.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.326
The word "bet" sets off
that competitive nature.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.526
I said, "Bet money, bitch."

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.648
Harry said, "Bet."
Wayne, "Bet."

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.529
Spank, "Bet." Joey, "Bet."

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.409
"Bitch, bet." "Bet." "Bet."

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.050
"Motherfucker, bet." "Bet."

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.009
"Nigga, bet."
"Bet." "Bet it, bitch."

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.684
"Bet." "Bet."

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.364
"Fuck you, bet." "Bet."

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.249
We get in the car,
we drive to Walmart.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.128
We drive to Walmart,
we buy a ping-pong table.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.171
We go back to Joey's house,
we set the ping-pong table up in the kitchen.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.242
We get to playing ping-pong.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.281
Our game looks nothing like the game
that we were watching on TV.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.326
So we decide to add
alcohol into the mix.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.880
Hit the ball into the net,
gotta take a shot.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.043
You get slammed on,
gotta take two shots.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.367
You get slammed on
and you miss the ball completely,

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.044
gotta take three shots.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.691
Somewhere along the line,
the game got so competitive

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.685
that Joey decided
to cut his jeans into jean shorts

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.047
'cause he said he wasn't getting enough
lateral movement

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.804
in the house.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.644
Here's the fucked-up part about that.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.250
It was Joey's house.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.324
All Joey had to do is go upstairs

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.802
and change into a pair
of goddamn jean shorts.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.368
Here's the second
fucked-up part about that.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.051
Joey went upstairs
to get the scissors

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.444
to come back downstairs
and cut his jeans
into jean shorts.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.609
Somewhere along the line,
I get slammed on.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.081
I go to return the ball,
I miss the ball,

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.567
run into the wall,
fall down, black out.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.085
I wake up, it's 10:00 am.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.491
Holy shit.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.045
It's 10:00 am!

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.960
I wake up,
I look at my phone,

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.647
I got 37 missed calls,
47 text messages.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.651
Fellas, I'ma tell you
something.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.768
The worst thing
that you can do in life

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.161
is not respond to
your lady's text messages.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.287
Do you hear me?

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.010
That's the worst thing
that you could do.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.367
The reason why I say that
is because your woman

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.410
will then proceed to having
a conversation with herself

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.888
through the messages
that she's sending you.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.726
Listen to me.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.644
This is what that conversation
looks like.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.205
"So this is what we doing now?

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.320
"Wow!

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.404
"I guess this what we're doing now.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.121
"You know what?

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.931
"I hope that bitch is worth it.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.407
"Wow!

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.723
"So you telling me
that bitch is worth it?

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.166
"You know what?

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.720
"Don't even come
home tonight.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.126
"Wow!

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.886
"So you really not gonna
come home tonight?"

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.806
She's drawing conclusions
and answering the conclusions

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.406
that she drew by herself.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.206
It's a sickness, ladies.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.805
It's a disease.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.125
First thing I do,
I haul ass into Joey's room.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.328
"Joey! Wake your ass up!

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.165
"What the hell you let me
sleep over here till 10:00 am for?

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.810
"You know damn well
I gotta be home."

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.450
He said, "Let me stop
you right there, Kev.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.843
"First of all, I don't know where
you have to be. Okay?

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.400
"What I do know,
is that I'm where I'm supposed to be.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.170
"I know that.
I know that much."

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.164
He said, "It sounds to me like
you need to make better life decisions."

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.685
I said, "Joey, don't start that shit.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.447
"Don't start that.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.885
"This is serious.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.291
"It's 10:00 am!

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.850
"I can't just
walk in the house

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.763
"with nothing wrong
with me at 10:00 am.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.968
"I'm not drunk,
I'm not injured.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.522
"I can't stroll in the house perfectly fine
and be like, 'Morning,'

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.924
"and just go to bed like everything's all right
at fucking 10:00 am."

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.570
He said, "Why not?
That's your house."

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.201
"I don't give a fuck
whose house it is, Joey!

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.486
"It's the principle!"

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.607
I said, "Reverse it.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.727
"Let's reverse it.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.564
"Let's say your lady
stayed out all night.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.364
"You'd been calling and
texting her all night,

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.851
"she ain't responded
to nothing.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.161
"She just walks in
the house at 10:00 am.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.402
"In your mind,
what was she doing?"

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.284
"Oh, that means she was
out there sucking dick,

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.528
"that's what that means
she was doing."

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.726
I said, "That's my point.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.689
"That's what she's gonna
think I was doing."

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.967
"Your lady gonna think you was sucking dick,
that's what you telling me?

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.408
"Well, you ain't sucked no dick over here,
I'll tell you that.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.410
"This ain't the dick-sucking house,

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.528
"so I don't know where you did that at."

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.763
"Joey, shut your dumb ass up!
Shut up!

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.848
"Bottom line, I'm not going to
my house like this."

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.604
I said, "Joey, I got a plan.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.920
"This is what I'm gonna do.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.287
"Get up, get dressed.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.089
"Put on the same clothes
you had on last night.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.924
"We're gonna get in my car.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.050
"I'm gonna run my car
into a wall, okay?

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.929
"That way the airbags deploy.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.968
"When they deploy, I'ma take a selfie.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.121
"I'ma post it.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.124
"I'ma be like, 'Fuck!
Another accident! Shit happens.'

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.881
"#HospitalReady.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.009
"#iLoveMyLadyTho."

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.241
Um...

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.771
"#TheDevilisALiar.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.284
"#JesusTookTheWheelAgain."

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.567
The point that
I'm making is that I was willing

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.608
to go through all
those drastic measures

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.569
just to avoid telling the truth.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.325
The truth is,
I was playing ping-pong.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.370
But if I walk in the house at 10:00 am,

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.761
as soon as I walk in the house,
my lady in the kitchen,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.729
and she like, "Where the fuck was
you at last night?"

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.485
And I go,
"I was playing ping-pong!"

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.963
And then her black girlfriend pop out
and she like, "Ping-pong?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.651
"Really?"

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.964
I'm in trouble.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.963
I know my lady, people.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.521
I'ma tell you the worst thing
about my woman.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.931
The worst thing about her
is her sense of humor.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.723
After I proposed, I had to
go to Atlanta for two months.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.201
I'm in Atlanta,
I'm filming a movie.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.647
I get to my hotel,
I unpack my bag,

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.849
I find a pocket pussy in my bag.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.289
For those people here tonight
who do not know what a pocket pussy is,

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.010
a pocket pussy...

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.806
A pocket pussy is a pussy
you put in your pocket.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.927
I don't know, people.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.846
It's self-explanatory.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.207
I think the definition
is in the title.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.282
All I know is,
I didn't put it in my bag.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.561
I call her.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.766
"Hey!

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.204
"You put this pocket
pussy in my bag?"

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.446
"Yes.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.851
"Yes, I did."

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.046
"For what?"

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.009
"Because you're gonna
be gone for two months.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.851
"If you get the urge to do something,
I suggest you do it

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.922
"to that pocket pussy."

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.850
"Girl, get off my phone. Bye."

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.882
"Bye."

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.526
I hang up the phone,
unpack my bag,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.841
I put the pocket pussy
on the table.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.728
I walk by that pocket pussy
for three days, people.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:20.242
Each day became more difficult
than the day before.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.007
Day one...
Day one, I was cool.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.201
"Ha!

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.567
"She bought a pocket pussy,
put a pocket pussy in my bag!

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.847
"She crazy, bought a pocket pussy!"

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.685
Day two.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.886
"Let me read the package.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.961
"What does it say?

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.121
"Like, what is it?"

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.040
Day three.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.724
"I'ma open it
'cause I wanna smell it.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.881
"Is it real?

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.485
"Like, what is it?"

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.806
Day four was
the saddest day of my life.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.606
Day four was the day that I decided
to fuck the pocket pussy.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.001
Let me tell you when it got bad.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.560
It didn't get bad until I caught a reflection

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.325
of what I was doing in the mirror.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.122
I was going to work
on this pocket pussy, people.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.406
I swear to God.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.609
I was butt-ass naked,
sweating, talking shit.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.406
"You think I'm just gonna
walk by you every day?

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.851
"That's what you think?

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.251
"You asked for this.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.288
"You wanted this
just as much as I did."

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.091
I was so disappointed in myself.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.685
Let me tell you,
here's why I was mad.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.401
I was mad at the fact
that they make contraptions for men.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:25.926
Like, fellas, if we wanna use something
to please ourselves sexually,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.524
we look like creeps.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.761
Perverts.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.126
Women, you got it made.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.290
You got cute shit.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:34.249
You got the bullet.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.401
The bullet is this big.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.970
You can fit it in your coin purse.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.962
Use it at your desk at work.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.122
"You all right, Carol?"
"I am now."

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.564
"What the fuck happened to you?"

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:04.810
It's not the same for men.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.008
I've been to the sex store.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.725
The shit that I saw,
it disgusted me.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.685
The pocket mouth.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.000
The pocket ass.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.411
The pocket titties.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.966
I was disgusted.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.044
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.760
I bought all of it.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.001
I did.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.125
No, I know. I know.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.689
That's one of
the longest walks

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.410
I've ever taken back
to my car in my life.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.367
When they give you that pitch-black
pervert plastic bag,

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.527
you're trying
to look normal.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.045
You look like
a fucking creep.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.282
Everything about
you says "creep".

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.807
You're trying to speak,

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.325
"How you all doing?
Everybody all right?"

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.720
"Get your freaky ass
outta here, man!

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.246
"I see that
black plastic bag full of dicks.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.085
"Get your dick-in-a-bag-ass
outta here, man."

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.685
"Right, all right. Got you."

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.731
I was excited when I got back
to my hotel.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.006
I laid it all out on the bed.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.969
I was like, "All right.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.561
"Who's gonna get this dick first?"

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.087
I was excited.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.606
I was excited
'cause I created the perfect woman.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.524
I had the black ass,
the white titties, the Latina mouth.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.568
Whoo-hoo! Oh, man.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.123
It looked like somebody raped
Mrs. Potato Head and left it all over the place.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.124
"I couldn't do it. I can't do this shit.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.690
"I can't use this."

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.445
There's only one thing
that I've ever used for sexual enhancement.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.567
One thing.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.802
One thing.
I don't give a shit, I'll tell the truth.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.881
I'll be honest with you.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.371
I was having a bad week.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.681
It was a bad sex week for me.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.003
I was cumming fast all week.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.240
It was a premie week.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.243
That's what I called it.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.609
It didn't get bad until my lady gave me that
frustration deep breath.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.046
Your lady ever give you that?

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.531
She roll over on you...

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.811
"You want me to rub your back?

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.565
"You all right? You want me to
do anything?

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.402
"I'm not drinking enough water,
that's the problem.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.528
"I'm not drinking enough water.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.726
"I'm dehydrated.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.683
"I really think that's the problem."

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.122
I've only used one thing
for sexual enhancement.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.531
One thing.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.801
Good thing about me and my friends
is we fucking... We talk.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.644
We confide in one another.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.767
I called Nate.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.127
I said, "Nate, I don't know what's going
on with my body, man.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.804
"I've been cumming fast all week, dude.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.166
"Is this a medical issue?

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.607
"Like, really, do I need to go
to the doctor?

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.682
"Is my blood level low?
Do I need a pill?"

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.127
He said, "Shut your ass up.
You're a man.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.651
"Happens to the best of us."

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.724
He said, "If you wanna fix this right away,
I've got this numbing cream.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.007
"You put the numbing cream
on your shit before you do it,

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.320
"it'll numb you up, you'll last forever."

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.926
I said, "Nate, I need that tonight."

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.127
True story.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.647
I go to Nate's house, he gives me the cream,
I put it on at his house.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.121
I call my lady, I start talking shit.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.884
"Hey, you've been
running your mouth all week.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.325
"As soon as I get home,

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.007
"Operation
Put-A-Hole-In-Your-Back is in session.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.605
"As soon as I get home."

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.648
"Whatever, whatever."
"Ain't no whatever.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.690
"Hole-In-Your-Back as
soon as I get home."

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.489
I get home, we go at it.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.369
She stops me,
she starts giving me head.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.681
I stop her.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.841
We start doing it again.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.921
I'm talking shit.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.161
Uh-huh.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.645
Uh-huh!

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.965
"You did this!

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.442
"You did this to yourself!

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.044
"Look at you sitting there,
looking all stupid.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.407
"With that dumb-ass
goddamn look on your face.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.244
"Can't say shit now.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.371
"Say something!

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.685
"Say something!

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.290
"Say something!

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.645
"Say something!

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.250
"Say something!

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.844
"Say something!"

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.051
She said,

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.724
"I can't feel my mouth."

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.404
I said, "What?"

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.884
She said, "My mouth feels numb.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.042
"I can't feel my mouth."

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.164
I look down, slobber and shit coming out
the side of her mouth.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.008
It dawned on me she done sucked all
the numbing cream off.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.930
But as a man,
you can't tell on yourself.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.923
You gotta take this to the grave.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.604
So I just made
some shit up.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.489
I said, "You must be allergic
to these pillowcases.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.528
"These are new pillowcases."

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.926
She's like, "I know."
She said,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.480
"I know, I'm gonna
throw them in the trash."

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.840
I said, "Yeah.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.888
"We gotta get rid of these."

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.608
This is what almost
made me shit on myself.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.841
She said...

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.001
She said,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.207
"I don't feel pretty."

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.764
"You don't look it right now.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.921
"This is fucked up.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.929
"This is bad for everybody.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.121
"You over here with
that permanent

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.611
"going-down-on-the-roller-coaster face."

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.489
This is fucked up.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.646
"Oh, no. Oh, no."

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.122
I let, like, a week go by,
then I told her.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.884
I told her
what happened.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.450
I didn't give a shit.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.971
I told you guys,
I'm 36.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.044
36 is the perfect age
to stop giving a shit.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.486
The shit that I used to care about,
I don't care about anymore.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.210
Like when I wear white underwear.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.645
Now, I don't care about wearing 'em.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.690
Back then, if I had, like,
shit stains in my drawers,

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.202
I would try to get my drawers
before she saw them.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.805
Get 'em out of the house.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.803
Get in my car, drive, cut 'em up,

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.087
throw 'em out at different exits.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.006
"She ain't never gonna find these.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.328
"CSI couldn't find these."

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.805
Why do women love to argue
about obvious shit?

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.166
Like, she found a pair of my drawers

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.890
with shit stains in them one time,

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.086
she confronted me.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.400
"Uh, excuse me.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.084
"What is this?"

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.247
"Bitch, it's shit.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.129
"What do you think it is?
It's shit.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.401
"It's perfectly placed
in the crack of my ass.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.369
"What else would it be?

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.727
"What, you think I got a Sharpie
and I'm fucking with you?

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.643
"You think I got a brown Sharpie,

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.529
"and I'm like, 'She's gonna
think this is shit?'

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.602
"Smell it, it smells like shit."

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.809
I got mad 'cause I
knew where I hid them.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.120
So I tried to flip it.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.443
I was like, "What the fuck you doing
behind the dresser?

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.522
"I hid those behind the dresser!"

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.720
Shit that I used to
care about, I don't care.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:39.164
I don't care about not giving a shit
as long as I don't go crazy.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.163
I don't wanna become crazy.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.765
I respect crazy people too much.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.887
The reason why,

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.885
I've had too many situations
with real-life crazy people.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.009
I'ma tell you, the craziest situation
I've ever been in,

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.886
one night, I'm drunk. I'm hungry.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.201
Everything's closed,
so I stop at a gas station.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.890
I go to the gas station
and it's crowded.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.530
There's like 13 people in line.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.967
I want my chips
and snacks that bad

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.883
that I'm willing to wait in line.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.530
I decide to open up my chips.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.728
I start eating them while I'm in line.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.531
Out of nowhere, the guy in front
of me snaps.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.489
"Sick of this shit!

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.362
"Bitch on the register
all fucking slow!

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.805
"I bet you'll speed it up

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.487
"when I start shooting
these motherfuckers in the head!"

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.164
When I turned back around,
we locked eyes.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.288
We're looking at each other.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:34.843
I panicked, I was like, "You took the words right
outta my goddamn mouth!

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.922
"I was about to say the same shit!"

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.082
He said, "Yeah, 'cause me
and you brothers, that's why.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.605
"Don't worry, I got this one.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.409
"You get the next one.
You can leave."

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.481
I said, "Thank you."

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.483
I left real fast.
I didn't say shit.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.244
I just walked out.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.286
Let me tell you something.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.409
One of the most uncomfortable moments
in my life was the day

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.925
that I had to walk by 13 people

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.128
that have just been told
that they was about to die

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.202
when I got chose to live.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.327
The reason why I was mad

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.050
was 'cause they kept staring
at me on my way out.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.281
I was like, "What?

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.801
"He chose me.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.882
"What do you want
from me?"

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.689
This one lady was like,
"Call the cops."

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.807
I was like, "I can't.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.847
"My phone's dead.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.922
"Just like you."

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.047
And I walked out.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.121
I was like this.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.967
I was just happy to be alive.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.648
I got stories like that for days.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.167
I can give you guys, by far,

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.327
this is probably my most uncomfortable
moment in life by far.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.165
I'm at the airport.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.810
I just landed.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.365
I'm on my way to baggage claim.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.283
While I'm walking
to baggage claim,

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.569
out of nowhere, my stomach tells my ass
that I gotta shit right now.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.964
I've never felt anything like this
in my life.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.008
I had to shut my body down.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.447
Don't nobody know what's going on
except me and my ass.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.124
I had to lock my ass up.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.009
That's when you just get tight ass.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.560
I'm having a conversation
with my ass.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.210
"Come on, man.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.681
"You really gonna do
this shit right now?"

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.445
My ass was like,
"Yup, right now."

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.046
"You can't wait 20 minutes
till I get back to the house?"

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.645
"Nope, you got 20 seconds.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.846
"Clock starts now.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:12.361
"19, 18, 17, 16, 15..."

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.124
I say, "You got to be shitting me."

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.690
He said, "I'm not, but I will."

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.967
"Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Wait. Wait!"

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.850
I don't wanna go to the bathroom
at the airport,

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.524
but I don't have a choice.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.602
The reason why I don't
wanna go to the bathroom at the airport

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.210
is because I don't want
people taking pictures of me

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.965
going to the bathroom
and coming out, posting it.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.969
#KevinHartStinkybutt.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.166
People play too much.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.924
Social media shit
has gotten out of hand.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.483
But I can't hold it, I have to go.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.367
I make the decision to use
the bathroom at the airport.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.807
I'm in the bathroom stall, right?

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.528
Once again, people, you cannot make
shit like this up.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.126
This is what it looks like, people.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.248
No, I'm for real,
this is a life-size photo.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.481
This is really what it looks like.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.483
This is how small I am
on an actual toilet.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.204
I'm in the bathroom.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.770
It's 6:30 in the morning.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.330
I'm by myself.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.571
By myself.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.405
It's quiet.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.241
It's just like this.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.481
Quiet.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.651
This is what I hear outta nowhere.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.243
"Yo, Kev Hart,
how long you gonna be, man?

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.010
"I wanna get a picture
with you when you come out."

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.606
Immediately I put my feet up.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.523
I did this right here.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.886
I said, if he can't see
my feet, he'll go away.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.291
He's like, "Come on, man,
I saw your feet already.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.361
"I know you're in there.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.441
"Just gimme a timeframe.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.521
"How long you gonna be?"

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.722
"Gimme like 15, 20 minutes, man."

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.001
"Come on, man, that's too long.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.003
"My flight leaves in like 10 minutes.
Just pinch it.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.650
"Pinch it off for me."
"What the fuck?

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.484
"What? No, man.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.641
"Ain't nobody's pinching nothing, man.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.721
"Just get outta here."

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.290
"Kev, don't do me like that.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.771
"I'm your biggest fan, man.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.966
"I support everything you do.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.405
"What would you do if you was me?"

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.891
"I would let me shit by myself, man.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:12.961
"Just get outta here."

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.201
He said, "Kev, come on.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.281
"You know what?

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.169
"This is what I'ma do,
I'ma get my picture real quick.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.402
"I'm just gonna put
my phone over the stall,

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.323
"I'ma snap a picture real quick."

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.926
The fear that went through my body

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.045
of looking up and seeing a camera flash.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.329
Oh, my God, I was scared because
I didn't put toilet paper on the toilet seat.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.401
I didn't have time.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.444
I didn't want that picture to get out
'cause I didn't want my fan base to know

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.562
that I be raw-butting
these toilet seats sometimes.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.963
I said y'all gonna
lose respect for me

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.283
if you find out that I be raw-butting
these toilet seats.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.964
Listen, the reason
why I had to go

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.724
to the bathroom was
because I drank coffee.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.165
I don't drink coffee.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.004
My lady drinks coffee.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.485
She had a vanilla latte,
I tasted it.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.767
I said, "God damn, babe.
That's good. What is that?"

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.080
She said,
"A vanilla latte."

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.446
I said, "Yo,
I'm gonna get me one.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.329
"Where'd you get it from?"
She said, "Starbucks."

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.765
I said, "I'm going."
She said, "Babe,

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.689
"I should go with you
'cause you've never been."

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.165
"Girl, shut up. I'm grown,

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.446
"I'ma go by myself."

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.521
"No, babe, I'm serious.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.409
"You don't know how it works there.
Let me go with you."

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.209
"Girl, shut up. I'm fine."

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.011
I get in the car,
I drive to Starbucks.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.209
She keeps calling me
while I'm on the way to Starbucks.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.884
"You get there yet?"
"You okay?"

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.961
"You need my help?"

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.485
Now I'm getting nervous.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.561
Like, what the fuck
is this place?

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.641
I'm really getting nervous.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.650
I get to Starbucks,
I've never seen anything like it.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.291
I open the door, it's mayhem.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.885
All I hear is noise.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.121
"Gimme the frappe whap.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.247
"Frappe whap.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.890
"Frappe what, frapped lat.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.365
"Frappe whap, fat lat."

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.965
I've never seen anything like it.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.769
I'm scared. I'm in line.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.649
I don't even know how I got in line,
but I'm there.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.210
I'm like, in the middle.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.328
I'm trying to fit in,
but I know I don't.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.447
I'm sweating.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.760
I'm next.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.525
Here's what I don't like.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.728
I don't like the pressure
that the barista

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.689
put on me for not knowing the lingo.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.127
It's my first time ever
going to Starbucks, people.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.725
My first time.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.768
I'm like, "Good morning.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.841
"Um...

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.642
"It's crowded, right? Shit.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.171
"Um, what do I want?

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.606
"Let me get a...

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.650
"Let me get a vanilla lattet."

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.650
"I'm sorry, sir, what'd you say?"

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.360
"Is it...

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.447
"Lemme get a vanilla latex.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.522
"Lattet. Let me get that."

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.124
"You mean latte?"
"Yes, that's what I mean.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.487
"Let me get
a small vanilla latte."

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.006
"Okay, sir, that's
one tall vanilla latte."

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.764
"No. That's not
what I want.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.161
"I don't want a tall,
I want a small."

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.969
"Sir, a tall is a small."

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.121
"No, it's not.

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.009
"If that's the case, I would be tall.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.765
"Tall is tall,
a small is small."

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.650
You know what,
I don't wanna cause a rut.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.326
"Whatever your version of a small is,
lemme get that."

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.447
"How would you like that, sir?

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.726
"Would you like that iced or hot?"

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:02.846
Fuck is going on, man?

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.365
What you talking about?

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.205
Like, when I get nervous,
I just repeat shit.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.767
"Would I like it iced or hot?

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:14.040
"Would I like it iced or hot?

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.160
"Fuck. Um...

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.527
"Shit.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.491
"How would you get it?"

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.131
The lady behind me was like, "Mmm."

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.406
She only had one shoulder.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.090
I stopped talking to her immediately.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.090
I said, "Let me get it iced."

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.003
She said, "What'd you say?"
I said, "Hot.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.081
"Hot ice. Icy hot.

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.161
"Put it together like that.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.527
"That's how I want it.
That's how I drink it."

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:38.844
"Sir, would you like
it whipped or blended?"

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.045
"Would I like it whipped or blended?

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.966
"Shit.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.527
"Fuck.

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.206
"Would I like it whipped or blended?

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.005
"You know what, whip it.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.604
"Whip it, whip it real good.
Just do that."

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.209
"Sir, for $2 more, do you wanna
make it a skinny?"

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.882
"Well, you know, I ain't trying
to leave with the fat bitch.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.088
"Do what you gotta do, man."

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.929
"Sir, what kind of milk would you like?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.606
"Would you like whole milk, skim milk,
2%, soy?"

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.883
"I didn't even know there was that
many milks, man.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.405
"Fuck. Shit.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.720
"What, you all got the heat on?

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.007
"God damn, my fucking ass
is sweating.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.684
"Can you back up?

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.410
"God damn, back up!

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.402
"You don't see I'm trying to
take this test?

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.606
"Shit.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.969
"How many? You say
there's four milks?

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.041
"Fuck.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.168
"Put them all in there.
Give me every milk you've got.

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.642
"I want every goddamn milk you got.
Put it in there."

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.240
"Sir, would you like to cut it with caramel,
put cinnamon on top?"

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.208
"You know what? I just want to cancel it.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.806
"I don't even know what I have at this point.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.962
"Am I getting a latte
or am I baking a fucking cake?

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.041
"Just let me...

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.281
"Let me get a banana.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.169
"Can I get that banana?

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.321
"Just put some
water in my hand

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.084
"so I can put it on my face real quick."

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.764
"You want that water to be hot or cold?"

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.205
"What the fuck is your problem, man?

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.609
"God damn! Will you back up?

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.091
"Back up!

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.286
"Shit!

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.771
"Relax, bend your knees."

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.808
"I can't bend my knees because I got attacked
by an orangutan."

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.126
The black girl popped out.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.202
"Orangutan?

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.881
"Really?"

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.284
I'm gonna be
honest with y'all.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.488
I don't like people that
drink Starbucks coffee.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.527
I really don't.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.682
Matter of fact, if you're
a real Starbucks drinker

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.091
and you're here tonight,
make some noise.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.400
If you're a real Starbucks drinker.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.851
Okay, all of y'all can suck my balls.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:45.810
I wanted you all to know
who I was talking to.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.288
Here's my question.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.440
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.726
Like,

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.248
do you hear what you order?

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:58.210
Do you hear what you're asking people
to bring you back?

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.931
Have you ever made an innocent
Starbucks run for somebody?

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.082
You don't even drink it,
you're just being nice.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.004
"Hey, man, I'm going to Starbucks real quick.
I'ma get a bottle of water.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.286
"Somebody want something?"

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.441
It's always one guy.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.842
You can tell he drinks way too much coffee
'cause he got too much energy.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.531
"Hey! Yay!
Hey-yay-yay!

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.681
"You going to Starbucks?

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.364
"You going to Starbucks?
You going to Bucky's?

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.602
"Do me a favor, man.
Let me get a, um...

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.081
"Let me get
a caramel macchiato.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.850
"Caramel macchiato.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.445
"Light ice. Not heavy.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.249
"If it's heavy,
I'm not gonna drink it.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.367
"Do me a favor.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.010
"Tell 'em to put
a little bit of soy in it.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.890
"Not a lot, just enough
for me to taste it and go...

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.082
"'Oh, boy.' Okay?

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.161
"Three whips.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.924
"Take that third whip
to the top of the lip

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.241
"so I can take a sip,
you got it?

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.322
"You ain't got it.
I'ma say it one more time.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.603
"Caramel macchiato.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.200
"Caramel macchiato.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.805
"Light ice. Not heavy.

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.564
"If it's heavy,
I'm not gonna drink it.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.641
"Do me a favor.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.210
"Tell 'em to put
a little bit of soy in it.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.886
"Not a lot, just enough
for me to taste it and go...

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.200
"'Oh, boy.' Okay?

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.247
"Three whips.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.964
"Take that third whip

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.361
"so I can take a sip, you got it?"

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.405
"Let me make sure
I got it.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.448
"Let me say it back to you.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.571
"Black coffee. Did I get it?

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.880
"Is it black coffee?

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.567
"'Cause if you think I'ma go across the street
and say what you just said,

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.723
"you can suck the back of my dick
twice on a Tuesday.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.246
"Not a lot, just with
a little bit of soy.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.688
"Enough for you to suck my dick and go...
'Oh, boy.'

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.926
"When you get to the top of my dick,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.162
"slow down so I can know
you really sucked that shit."

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.049
Philadelphia,
my name is Kevin Hart.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.406
Thank you!

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.011
Thank you!

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.803
God damn it, thank you!

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.046
I love y'all!

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.121
Thank you, man!

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.525
Thank you!

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.210
From the top of
this goddamn stadium
to the bottom, thank you!

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.521
I love y'all, man!

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.967
I'll tell you what, Philadelphia.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.327
This is a fucking moment, dude.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.970
This is a moment.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.041
You hear me?

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.890
It's a moment.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.570
When you look around this room tonight,
what I love the most

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:15.607
is that I see every race, ethnicity,
nationality possible.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.920
You hear me?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.162
I see some of everybody.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.483
We all came under the same roof
and we laughed tonight.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.801
If you can laugh together,
you can live together.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.008
If you can live together,
you can love together.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.128
I live by those rules,
and I'll be damned

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.527
if I didn't see that
shit happen tonight.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.445
In my city,

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.363
I made fucking history,
goddamn it.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.329
I'm in the record books,
you hear me?

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.009
I am in the record books.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.329
My name is Kevin Hart,

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.529
and this has been the best night of
my fucking life.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.647
You hear me?

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.000
Thank you all.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.367
I appreciate you
so goddamn much.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.965
Good night. Peace.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.201
That's a show!

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.281
Did you see that?

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.169
53,000 people!
Did you feel that energy?

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:24.366
That love in the building?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.487
Yes. I saw it,
Kevin, you were great.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.561
What's wrong?
What's going on?

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.761
You know the man you killed?
Yeah.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.041
He wasn't the leader.
What you talking about?

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.087
They're back.
They're here?

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.446
We gotta go!
Get the fuck outta here.

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.927
It's Agent 5-4.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.490
I need a helicopter ASAP.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.045
We need an ID challenge.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.167
Password, please.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.641
Um...

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.881
National Geographic titties
are my favorite thing.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.041
Sorry, Agent 5-4.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.246
You're breaking up.
Please come again?

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.203
Titties with no nipples
on National Geographic

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.446
are my favorite
thing to watch on TV.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.329
Titties with no nipples?

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.640
That's your password?

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:54.846
ID confirmed, Agent 5-4.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.331
Helicopter en route.
Thank you.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.402
We're picking up two inbound
bogeys about half a mile

01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.561
east of your location.
Shit.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.846
They're on our ass.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.241
Oh, shit.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.526
Get in.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.850
So what now?

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.611
Now?

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.843
Well, now we do the same thing
on a global scale.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:48.765
I think it's time to show the world
just how funny Kevin Hart is.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.249
Kevin!
