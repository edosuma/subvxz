WEBVTT

00:02.139 --> 00:03.674
I really like
Valentine's Day

00:03.708 --> 00:05.045
in this office.

00:05.079 --> 00:06.446
It's kind of like
grade school.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.186
Everybody gives out
little presents and stuff.

00:09.219 --> 00:10.654
Like last year,

00:10.688 --> 00:13.060
Jim gave me this card
with Dwight's head on it.

00:13.095 --> 00:16.233
It was horrifying
and funny.

00:24.182 --> 00:25.285
Phyllis.

00:25.318 --> 00:26.820
You could just
sign here.

00:26.854 --> 00:29.627
Roy and I are saving
for the wedding,

00:29.660 --> 00:32.833
so I made him promise not
to get me anything too big.

00:32.865 --> 00:34.536
Happy Valentine's Day,
Darling,

00:34.570 --> 00:36.873
love Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

00:36.906 --> 00:40.715
Isn't he sweet?
Yeah. Wow.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.883
All right, Dwight.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.887
As you know, I'm heading
to New York today

00:43.920 --> 00:45.491
doing a presentation
on the branch

00:45.524 --> 00:46.826
to the new CFO.

00:46.861 --> 00:49.332
And you want me
to come with you.
No.

00:49.367 --> 00:50.534
Opposite of that.

00:50.568 --> 00:52.706
I will stay here
and run things on this end.

00:52.739 --> 00:53.875
Very good.

00:53.907 --> 00:54.877
Question.

00:54.909 --> 00:57.216
Will you be seeing Jan
when you're in New York?

00:57.249 --> 00:59.153
I probably will.
Why do you ask?

00:59.187 --> 01:01.190
Well, it's Valentine's Day.

01:01.224 --> 01:02.626
And you guys,
you know...

01:02.658 --> 01:03.894
Yeah.

01:03.927 --> 01:05.864
Screwed.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.769
What is your problem?

01:07.802 --> 01:09.373
This is a business trip.

01:09.406 --> 01:11.343
I would have to be
a raving lunatic

01:11.377 --> 01:12.946
to try to talk to Jan

01:12.979 --> 01:14.450
about what happened
between us.

01:14.483 --> 01:15.851
Her words, not mine.

01:15.885 --> 01:18.557
She sent me an e-mail
this morning.

01:18.590 --> 01:23.335
But it is Valentine's Day.

01:23.367 --> 01:27.976
It's New York,
city of love.

01:28.008 --> 01:29.847
Hey, Pam,
you hard NY, right?

01:29.879 --> 01:31.516
You want me
to pick you up anything?

01:31.551 --> 01:32.518
That's okay.

01:32.552 --> 01:33.620
All right.

01:33.654 --> 01:34.823
The best present
would be

01:34.857 --> 01:37.662
you do a good job
in front of the new CFO.

01:37.696 --> 01:38.997
Dude, I'm going
to nail it.

01:39.030 --> 01:40.969
Me in New York?
Oh, I own that city.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.308
Fo'get abou' it!

01:43.341 --> 01:44.942
See ya!

01:49.952 --> 01:57.369
*

02:18.042 --> 02:20.382
Well, here we go
on our way to New York.

02:20.414 --> 02:21.716
New York, New York.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.021
The city so nice,
they named it twice.

02:24.054 --> 02:26.926
Manhattan
is the other name.

02:26.961 --> 02:29.566
So I broke up
with Katy

02:29.600 --> 02:30.902
and haven't been dating
anybody else.

02:30.934 --> 02:31.904
So this year,

02:31.936 --> 02:34.107
I don't have to worry
about Valentine's Day.

02:34.140 --> 02:35.812
It's gonna be good.

02:35.845 --> 02:36.947
I invited a couple
friends over.

02:36.981 --> 02:38.418
We're gonna play some cards.

02:38.451 --> 02:40.052
And I'll end up winning
a lot of money

02:40.087 --> 02:41.656
because they're idiots.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.428
It's gonna be great.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.066
What's this?
What is this?

02:47.101 --> 02:49.540
I don't know.
It's on your desk.

02:49.572 --> 02:51.710
Yeah, but who
put it here

02:51.743 --> 02:53.046
and for what purpose?

02:53.078 --> 02:54.716
It was there
when I sat down.

03:02.198 --> 03:06.072
Happy Valentine's Day.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.726
It's me.

03:16.761 --> 03:19.832
I'm the bobble-head.

03:22.205 --> 03:23.775
Yes!

03:23.807 --> 03:26.714
Ah!

03:26.746 --> 03:28.585
Yeah.

03:28.617 --> 03:29.920
The meeting
isn't till 3:00.

03:29.953 --> 03:31.924
But I always like to come
to New York

03:31.957 --> 03:33.093
a little bit early

03:33.126 --> 03:34.228
and hit some
of my favorite haunts.

03:34.261 --> 03:36.934
Like right here is my favorite
New York pizza joint.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.874
And I'm gonna go get me
a New York slice.

03:43.213 --> 03:45.918
Hey, Kelly. What's up?

03:45.952 --> 03:48.958
Nothing. Oh.
Except, oh my God, Jim.

03:48.991 --> 03:52.533
Last night, Ryan and I
totally finally hooked up.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.900
It was awesome.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.505
Oh, that's great.
I'm really happy for you.

03:55.539 --> 03:56.906
I know.
And it was so funny.

03:56.940 --> 03:58.710
'Cause we were at this bar
with his friends.

03:58.745 --> 04:00.481
And I was sitting
next to him the whole night.

04:00.481 --> 04:01.984
And he wasn't making a move.

04:02.016 --> 04:03.588
So in my head,
I was like, Ryan,

04:03.621 --> 04:04.656
what's taking you so long?

04:04.690 --> 04:05.692
And then he kissed me.

04:05.724 --> 04:07.093
And I didn't know
what to say.

04:07.127 --> 04:09.599
So I said, "Ryan,
what took you so long?"

04:09.632 --> 04:12.036
I mean, I just said it to him.
Can you believe that?

04:12.071 --> 04:12.906
Wow.

04:12.938 --> 04:14.942
Oh my God, Jim.
Is that embarrassing?

04:14.977 --> 04:16.111
I'm embarrassed.

04:16.144 --> 04:17.114
No, don't be.

04:17.146 --> 04:18.148
Oh, thank God.

04:18.183 --> 04:19.887
Because I was nervous, Jim.

04:19.919 --> 04:20.889
You will not believe.

04:20.921 --> 04:22.091
I bet.

04:22.124 --> 04:23.158
I was so nervous.

04:23.193 --> 04:25.899
But now--now I have
a boyfriend.

04:25.931 --> 04:29.773
I hooked up with her
on February 13th.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.980
Here it is.
Heart of New York City.

04:34.014 --> 04:35.283
Times Square.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.788
Named for the good times
you have

04:37.823 --> 04:40.260
when you're in it.

04:40.293 --> 04:42.197
Most people when they come
to New York,

04:42.231 --> 04:44.034
they go straight
to the Empire State Building.

04:44.068 --> 04:46.873
That's very touristy.
I come here.

04:46.906 --> 04:48.276
Great places to eat.

04:48.309 --> 04:50.948
We have Bubba Gump Shrimp,
Red Lobster down there.

04:50.981 --> 04:52.753
You know.

04:52.786 --> 04:57.294
This is--this is the heart
of civilization right here.

04:57.327 --> 05:00.368
Whoa.

05:03.106 --> 05:04.909
Oh.

05:04.943 --> 05:06.078
Guess what?

05:06.112 --> 05:08.384
Really?
Mm-hmm.

05:08.416 --> 05:11.857
They're from Bob again.
That's great.

05:15.364 --> 05:17.201
Everybody takes the subway
in New York.

05:17.234 --> 05:21.041
It's fast, it's efficient,
gets you there on time.

05:21.074 --> 05:22.378
It's a way to--

05:22.411 --> 05:24.248
Okay, there's a guy pooping

05:24.280 --> 05:26.920
in a cardboard box
down there.

05:26.954 --> 05:29.392
This is the world-famous
Rockefeller Center.

05:29.425 --> 05:31.229
Founded, of course,
by Theodore Rockefeller.

05:31.262 --> 05:33.166
This is the skating rink.

05:33.199 --> 05:37.174
And I think the Rangers
practice there sometimes.

05:37.207 --> 05:40.348
And it's--that's Tina Fey.

05:40.381 --> 05:44.255
That's Tina Fey
from Saturday Night Live.

05:44.288 --> 05:45.859
Hello. Hello.

05:45.892 --> 05:48.364
Hi. Oh, I'm s--
I'm sorry.

05:48.397 --> 05:51.871
I thought you were--
Okay.

05:51.904 --> 05:55.779
She looked like--she looked
a lot like Tina Fey.

05:55.812 --> 05:57.113
Hello. Hello.

05:57.146 --> 06:00.253
I thought that was Tina Fey,
but it wasn't.

06:00.287 --> 06:00.721
Are you serious?

06:00.721 --> 06:03.226
He was here?

06:03.258 --> 06:05.363
When? When I was talking
to the fake Tina Fey?

06:05.397 --> 06:08.202
Come on! No, s--

06:11.242 --> 06:13.012
Hello, Angela.
Did you her?

06:13.046 --> 06:14.315
Somebody totally
rocked the house

06:14.347 --> 06:16.252
and got me the best present
I've ever gotten.

06:16.284 --> 06:18.957
Really? I wouldn't know
anything about that.

06:18.991 --> 06:20.795
But I'm glad
you enjoyed it.

06:20.829 --> 06:22.799
Oh, I did. I did.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.803
I didn't get anything
for Valentine's Day.

06:24.837 --> 06:26.573
Oh, I bet you will
before the day is over.

06:26.605 --> 06:30.179
Really?
Well, I hope I do.

06:35.859 --> 06:39.331
I would love to live
in New York some day.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.168
It's a big dream of mine.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.537
Work corporate with Jan.

06:42.572 --> 06:43.975
Be awesome.

06:44.008 --> 06:46.545
Go to Broadway shows,
eat hotdogs.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.949
Scranton is great,

06:47.983 --> 06:52.859
but New York is like
Scranton on acid.

06:52.893 --> 06:55.296
No, on speed.
Nah.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.502
On steroids.

06:57.535 --> 07:00.841
Okay. Um, I think...

07:00.841 --> 07:03.245
that's either the Hudson
or the East.

07:03.278 --> 07:07.086
So we're back--should be
back this way.

07:07.121 --> 07:10.560
There is a lot of pressure
on me right now.

07:10.594 --> 07:13.398
It's like Michael Jordan
in the NBA finals

07:13.433 --> 07:16.404
or like Stormin'
Norman Schwarzkopf.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.546
And this presentation
is Desert Storm.

07:19.578 --> 07:21.148
And as soon as it's over,

07:21.182 --> 07:24.154
we will not have to deal
with those Iraqis anymore.

07:24.188 --> 07:26.525
Let's do it.

07:28.328 --> 07:29.330
No, that's all right.

07:29.364 --> 07:31.435
Spend money on her
instead of giving it to us.

07:31.470 --> 07:32.437
That's fine.

07:32.472 --> 07:34.943
No, I didn't even have
a seat for you anyway.

07:34.977 --> 07:37.014
Yeah.

07:37.047 --> 07:38.183
All right, man.

07:38.215 --> 07:40.319
Okay, have a good night.
Bye.

07:48.504 --> 07:50.239
Whoa, whoa.

07:50.272 --> 07:52.211
Phyllis Lapin?

07:52.243 --> 07:54.115
Holy God.
It's from Bob.

07:54.148 --> 07:56.219
Man, that thing's
bigger than I am.

07:56.251 --> 07:58.689
No, it's not.
Oh, zip it.

07:58.724 --> 07:59.758
There they are.

07:59.791 --> 08:00.760
What's up?

08:00.793 --> 08:02.030
Hey.
Hey hey.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.166
Michael Scott.
Josh Porter.

08:03.199 --> 08:05.637
Hi five.

08:05.671 --> 08:07.107
Bam.

08:07.140 --> 08:08.576
You know Dan Gordon
from Buffalo.

08:08.610 --> 08:10.047
Yeah, how you doing?

08:10.079 --> 08:11.181
Nobody needs
to introduce this guy.

08:11.215 --> 08:12.351
Craigers.

08:12.384 --> 08:13.753
Oh.
What's up, buddy?

08:13.787 --> 08:16.091
You have been kicked out
of every strip club in Albany,

08:16.124 --> 08:17.494
is that true?
Guilty. Yeah.

08:17.528 --> 08:19.365
So what's going on?
What'd I miss?

08:19.397 --> 08:21.635
Not much. They're, uh,
I guess running late upstairs.

08:21.670 --> 08:24.308
So we're just waiting
for the presentations.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.179
Cool. Good. Good.
Good.

08:26.211 --> 08:28.550
Give us some time
to catch up and...

08:32.290 --> 08:34.796
Pam, hi.
How you doing? Good.

08:34.828 --> 08:36.832
Listen, uh,
may I speak with you...

08:36.865 --> 08:39.205
privately?

08:39.238 --> 08:40.272
You can't fire me,
Dwight,

08:40.307 --> 08:41.543
just 'cause Michael's
not here.

08:41.576 --> 08:43.547
No, Pam, just, um--

08:43.580 --> 08:45.751
Just--

08:47.187 --> 08:49.559
You need to get something
for your girlfriend?

08:49.592 --> 08:51.162
Girlfriend. Yes.

08:51.195 --> 08:52.632
And the reason I didn't
get anything

08:52.665 --> 08:54.801
for this particular person--
who shall remain nameless--

08:54.836 --> 08:57.541
is that she's not really
the kind of person

08:57.575 --> 08:59.878
you'd think would be
in to Valentine's Day.

08:59.911 --> 09:01.081
She's kind of...

09:01.081 --> 09:03.453
Tightly wound?

09:03.485 --> 09:05.858
Exactly.

09:05.890 --> 09:07.761
Okay.

09:07.795 --> 09:10.601
Well, sometimes the gift
is really about the gesture,

09:10.633 --> 09:12.236
you know,
like what it means

09:12.270 --> 09:13.907
instead of what it is.

09:13.940 --> 09:16.745
You mean like a ham?

09:16.779 --> 09:18.650
No.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.621
Not like a ham.

09:20.654 --> 09:22.625
It's about doing something
so that the person knows

09:22.658 --> 09:25.363
that you really care
about her.

09:25.396 --> 09:27.533
That you remember her.
Okay, I get it.
That's great.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.706
Okay, shut up.
I know exactly what to do.

09:34.315 --> 09:35.350
How about you, Craig?

09:35.382 --> 09:36.484
Did you lose anyone?

09:36.518 --> 09:38.356
Oh man. Jan called me
in September.

09:38.388 --> 09:40.293
And she's like you gotta
fire four people.

09:40.327 --> 09:41.895
And I was just like, what?
You know.

09:43.899 --> 09:45.237
Did you?

09:45.270 --> 09:46.571
No. I just ignored her.

09:46.605 --> 09:48.343
She's the worst.

09:48.376 --> 09:49.645
She is our boss.

09:49.679 --> 09:50.948
She ain't my boss, dude.

09:50.980 --> 09:52.284
I don't work
for that bitch.

09:52.317 --> 09:53.619
Hey, ca--ca--come on.

09:53.653 --> 09:55.257
You know, that's not--
Just cool it.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.426
You like Jan?
How can you like Jan?

09:57.461 --> 09:59.265
Maybe because she's
my girlfriend.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.809
Was or not my girlfriend.

10:04.842 --> 10:06.010
We hooked up and--

10:06.044 --> 10:07.615
You hooked up with Jan?

10:07.647 --> 10:09.016
That was just,
you know, months ago.

10:09.050 --> 10:10.987
It was just once.

10:11.021 --> 10:12.390
God, it's just stupid.

10:12.423 --> 10:13.960
Just forget it.

10:13.993 --> 10:15.496
Yeah, let's change
the subject.

10:15.530 --> 10:16.800
Yeah, yeah.

10:19.772 --> 10:21.342
I don't know
what he's thinking,

10:21.374 --> 10:22.745
but I would just be
so psyched

10:22.778 --> 10:23.879
if we just dated
forever.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.384
Well, take it slow.

10:26.419 --> 10:28.021
'Cause it seems like
a lot of the time,

10:28.055 --> 10:29.826
things like that
need to--

10:33.097 --> 10:34.600
Soda.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.343
Cool.

10:38.376 --> 10:42.684
Hey, so do you want
to do something tonight?

10:42.717 --> 10:46.524
Oh, no, not
while I'm here.

10:46.559 --> 10:49.029
I mean, I know that it's
Valentine's Day or whatever,

10:49.064 --> 10:50.599
but there's totally
no pressure at all

10:50.632 --> 10:51.903
of any kind
whatsoever.

10:51.936 --> 10:54.640
I can't tonight.
I have plans with my friends.

10:54.675 --> 10:56.813
Okay. That's cool.

10:56.846 --> 10:59.585
I completely understand.
Okay. Cool.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.321
Okay.

11:22.630 --> 11:24.468
Josh Porter,
Stanford.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.638
And Michael Scott,
Scranton.

11:26.672 --> 11:27.975
Nice to meet you.
Ditto.

11:28.007 --> 11:29.110
How are you, Jan?

11:29.143 --> 11:30.914
Fine, Michael. Thank you.

11:30.948 --> 11:33.819
Okay. So we are
in the process

11:33.853 --> 11:35.121
of doing
a complete review

11:35.156 --> 11:37.160
of the company's
financial strength.

11:37.192 --> 11:38.496
All I'd like to do today...

11:38.529 --> 11:39.932
Nervous?
No, I'm not nervous.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.669
Well, I mean,
I guess I'd be lying

11:41.701 --> 11:43.506
if I didn't say
I was a little nervous.

11:43.539 --> 11:45.577
Um, the new CFO
is judging me on this too.

11:45.610 --> 11:46.745
And, well, it is Michael.

11:46.779 --> 11:51.021
So, yeah, I'm very nervous.

11:51.054 --> 11:53.058
So with the 12
new local accounts,

11:53.092 --> 11:56.064
we had a total
of 4% organic growth,

11:56.098 --> 11:58.703
which was just above
our pre-year targets.

11:58.736 --> 12:00.206
Thanks very much.
Thank you.

12:00.238 --> 12:02.476
Okay, Michael.

12:08.589 --> 12:10.158
What is a business?

12:10.192 --> 12:14.769
Is it a collection of numbers
and sales reports?

12:14.802 --> 12:16.103
Sure.

12:16.137 --> 12:17.574
But as you know,

12:17.606 --> 12:19.176
David and Jan,

12:19.210 --> 12:22.182
it is much more.

12:26.257 --> 12:34.007
*

12:38.816 --> 12:42.957
Life moves a little slower
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

12:42.991 --> 12:44.760
And that's the way
we like it.

12:44.796 --> 12:47.300
'Cause at Dunder Mifflin,
Scranton,

12:47.332 --> 12:50.640
we're not just
in the paper business,

12:50.673 --> 12:52.944
we're in the people
business.

12:52.977 --> 12:54.881
Let's meet some
of the folks

12:54.915 --> 12:59.023
who make the Scranton
branch so special.

12:59.057 --> 13:01.027
This is Stanley Hudson,

13:01.061 --> 13:03.032
one of our talented
salesmen.

13:03.065 --> 13:06.003
An African-American
father of two,

13:06.037 --> 13:07.607
Stanley's dedication

13:07.641 --> 13:09.376
is no doubt
one of the hallmarks

13:09.410 --> 13:11.180
of the foundation
of the business

13:11.213 --> 13:14.219
we're hoping to build
our basis on.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.993
Yeah, I shot a bunch
of footage around the office,

13:17.025 --> 13:18.996
edited it together
on my Mac.

13:19.029 --> 13:21.334
Was thinking about
entering it in some festivals.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.136
Probably won't.

13:22.170 --> 13:25.677
You know, not what this
is about.

13:25.710 --> 13:28.081
And finally,
Pam Beesly.

13:28.115 --> 13:29.417
Look at her.

13:29.449 --> 13:30.752
Look how cute.

13:30.787 --> 13:33.158
Not bad at all.

13:33.192 --> 13:34.795
As the receptionist,

13:34.829 --> 13:39.069
Pam is truly the gateway
to our world.

13:39.103 --> 13:42.109
Well, I hope this gave you
a little taste

13:42.143 --> 13:45.282
of what life is like here
at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

13:45.316 --> 13:48.823
What it's like to walk
a mile in Oscar's shoes.

13:48.857 --> 13:51.361
Or try on Phyllis' pants.

13:51.393 --> 13:53.799
Next time you're in town,
give us a call.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.703
Stop on by.

13:55.737 --> 13:57.974
I'm sure you'll be greeted
by a big smile

13:58.007 --> 13:59.476
and a "How you doing, pal?"

13:59.509 --> 14:01.681
Maybe even one of Angela's
famous brownies.

14:01.681 --> 14:05.923
And you'll know
that you're home.

14:14.908 --> 14:16.879
Great Scott!

14:18.783 --> 14:20.888
Questions.

14:22.856 --> 14:24.828
Wow.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.832
Okay. Okay,
thank you, Michael.

14:26.864 --> 14:29.369
That was great.
Yes, thank you.

14:29.404 --> 14:30.371
But for right now,

14:30.406 --> 14:32.075
what I'd really like
to know about

14:32.110 --> 14:34.079
is the branch's
performance.

14:34.113 --> 14:36.418
So do you have
that information as well?

14:36.451 --> 14:39.424
Yes, absolutely, David.

14:39.457 --> 14:42.530
Get that for you.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.876
Can you sign?

14:48.910 --> 14:49.576
Yeah.

14:49.609 --> 14:51.580
Oscar.

14:51.613 --> 14:53.251
Nothing for me?

14:53.285 --> 14:55.823
Join the club.

14:58.395 --> 14:59.430
Who's it from?

14:59.464 --> 15:01.133
My mom.

15:12.991 --> 15:14.294
It's frustrating
'cause we'd be

15:14.327 --> 15:16.030
so perfect together.

15:16.064 --> 15:18.869
You know what?
Here's the deal, Kelly.

15:18.903 --> 15:21.574
It would be really nice
if he was into you, right?

15:21.607 --> 15:23.578
It would be great.

15:23.611 --> 15:24.479
But he isn't.

15:24.514 --> 15:26.919
Yeah, but it would be
so great if he was.

15:26.953 --> 15:28.054
Well, he's not though.

15:28.088 --> 15:29.623
So you just gotta
suck it up.

15:29.657 --> 15:31.963
You just gotta move on.
Try to have some fun.

15:31.995 --> 15:34.199
Come to my poker game
tonight.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.636
Okay, cool.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.408
Is it okay
if I invite Ryan?

15:46.024 --> 15:47.660
And that about does it.
Thank you.

15:47.692 --> 15:51.633
Okay. Craig.

15:51.668 --> 15:53.237
Yeah. Here's the deal.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.578
I did not understand
this was supposed to be

15:56.611 --> 16:00.086
a full on like report
or whatnot.

16:00.119 --> 16:01.421
I'm sorry.

16:01.454 --> 16:04.627
What did you think
"financial presentation" meant?

16:04.660 --> 16:06.163
I was under the impression

16:06.198 --> 16:09.403
this was more of like
a meet-and-greet type deal.

16:09.437 --> 16:11.707
So does that mean
that you don't have

16:11.741 --> 16:13.611
the numbers
on your branch?

16:13.644 --> 16:15.115
That is correct. Yes.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.453
Craig, you realize

16:17.485 --> 16:19.289
that we are trying to decide
whether drastic steps

16:19.324 --> 16:20.626
need to be taken.

16:20.658 --> 16:22.295
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

16:22.330 --> 16:24.166
Well, the point is
that this doesn't exactly

16:24.200 --> 16:25.668
bode well for your branch.

16:25.702 --> 16:26.638
Oh, man.

16:26.670 --> 16:28.741
You know what?
Michael made that stupid movie.

16:28.775 --> 16:30.479
He doesn't get
in any trouble.

16:30.512 --> 16:32.550
Maybe I should've slept
with you too.

16:38.495 --> 16:40.032
Okay. Okay.
All right.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.701
No, no, no, I'm not--
I just--

16:41.733 --> 16:45.042
I just don't know
what to do anymore, Michael.

16:45.076 --> 16:47.113
I mean, I'm probably
going to get fired.

16:47.146 --> 16:48.682
No, you're not.

16:48.715 --> 16:50.751
Michael, the CFO thinks
that we slept together.

16:50.786 --> 16:53.725
Don't you understand?
People get fired for much less.

16:53.757 --> 16:55.696
And I just can't believe

16:55.729 --> 16:56.798
that you told everybody.

16:56.830 --> 17:00.072
And we didn't even
sleep together.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.042
Technically,
we fell asleep in the same bed.

17:02.042 --> 17:03.678
Oh, God.

17:03.712 --> 17:07.219
Michael, it was months ago.
It was once.

17:07.253 --> 17:09.824
It's over.

17:09.856 --> 17:12.095
Do you understand?

17:12.130 --> 17:14.733
Yes.

17:14.766 --> 17:18.474
I'm sorry.

17:18.507 --> 17:21.213
I'll fix this.
I'll talk to him.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.316
I'll talk to David.

17:22.349 --> 17:25.721
Surely, you cannot
be serious.

17:25.756 --> 17:28.494
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

17:28.527 --> 17:29.697
Airplane.

17:38.847 --> 17:40.886
Women are like wolves.

17:40.918 --> 17:43.725
If you want a wolf,
you have to trap it.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.729
You have to snare it.

17:45.762 --> 17:48.934
And then you have
to tame it.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.871
Keep it happy.
Care for it. Feed it.

17:50.906 --> 17:55.216
Lovingly the way an animal
deserves to be loved.

17:55.249 --> 17:59.857
And my animal deserves
a lot of loving.

18:03.632 --> 18:04.699
Hey, babe.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.704
You, uh,
almost ready to go?

18:06.738 --> 18:08.675
I guess, yeah.

18:08.708 --> 18:09.976
What's wrong?

18:10.010 --> 18:11.280
Nothing.

18:11.313 --> 18:13.284
It's just that I had
to sit here all day

18:13.317 --> 18:14.687
while Phyllis got
like an entire garden

18:14.719 --> 18:15.788
delivered to her.

18:15.821 --> 18:17.260
What, you're mad
at me?

18:17.292 --> 18:20.232
I mean, I know
that we said no big gifts,

18:20.266 --> 18:22.402
but I was kind of hoping
you'd get me something

18:22.436 --> 18:23.738
for Valentine's Day.

18:23.772 --> 18:25.876
Well, Valentine's Day
isn't over.

18:25.908 --> 18:27.446
Let's get you home,

18:27.479 --> 18:29.849
and you are gonna get
the best sex of your life.

18:33.055 --> 18:35.528
You understand this is
a very serious situation.

18:35.561 --> 18:37.300
No, no, no.
Yes, I-- Okay, well--

18:37.333 --> 18:38.467
All right,
here's the deal.

18:38.502 --> 18:40.538
This is my fault.
This is totally on me.

18:40.571 --> 18:41.874
Before you guys came in,

18:41.908 --> 18:43.845
I was talking to the guys,
we were all chatting.

18:43.878 --> 18:46.351
And I made a joke.

18:46.384 --> 18:47.685
A really dumb joke.

18:47.719 --> 18:49.556
And Craig the idiot
took it seriously.

18:49.589 --> 18:51.593
You made a joke?
I did.

18:51.627 --> 18:52.729
It was stupid.

18:52.763 --> 18:54.032
And Craig, you saw him,

18:54.064 --> 18:56.737
he's not the sharpest tool
in the shed.

18:56.771 --> 18:58.942
Although he is a tool.

18:58.975 --> 19:00.745
Well, I don't need
to explain to you

19:00.779 --> 19:02.282
that even a joke
about sexual relations

19:02.282 --> 19:03.985
with your boss--

19:04.018 --> 19:05.856
I know.
It was borderline at best.

19:05.889 --> 19:09.864
And--and Jan
is a fantastic executive

19:09.896 --> 19:11.868
and has all the integrity
in the world.

19:11.900 --> 19:15.376
And, um,
I'm really sorry.

19:15.408 --> 19:18.079
It'll never happen again.

19:20.016 --> 19:21.854
Uh, it's fine.

19:21.888 --> 19:24.394
Let's just, uh,
just forget it.

19:24.427 --> 19:26.730
Good.

19:36.783 --> 19:38.488
Heading out?

19:38.522 --> 19:39.823
Yeah.

19:39.857 --> 19:41.428
All right, Beesly.

19:41.461 --> 19:43.731
Hey, happy Valentine's Day.

19:43.764 --> 19:45.902
Bye.

19:49.709 --> 19:50.979
Good night, Pam.

19:51.012 --> 19:53.552
Night, Phyllis.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.162
Uh, Michael.

19:59.194 --> 20:01.166
Thank you again
for that, really.

20:01.198 --> 20:02.402
It was very nice.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.774
Oh, no big deal.
Really. Sorry again.

20:04.806 --> 20:07.913
Oh, no.
It's--it's okay.

20:07.946 --> 20:10.652
So, uh, happy
Valentine's Day.

20:10.685 --> 20:13.089
Yeah, happy
Valentine's Day.

20:25.816 --> 20:28.053
Oh.

20:32.530 --> 20:35.134
Oi vey...schmear.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.171
