WEBVTT

00:44.334 --> 00:47.917
"Planet Vegeta"

00:53.376 --> 00:56.751
"41 years ago"

01:22.042 --> 01:22.959
Damn it!

01:23.167 --> 01:25.001
They're crazy!

01:32.501 --> 01:34.042
--How rude!
--They mock us with a visit like this!

01:34.251 --> 01:37.167
Great King Cold has arrived.

01:38.001 --> 01:40.376
So it would seem.

02:17.501 --> 02:20.167
It's been too long, King Vegeta.

02:20.376 --> 02:24.042
Great King Cold, welcome.

02:25.834 --> 02:29.376
Allow me to introduce my son, Frieza.

02:33.334 --> 02:37.376
I-It is a pleasure to meet
you, Frieza-<i>sama.</i>

02:37.584 --> 02:40.501
The pleasure is mine.

02:42.959 --> 02:45.501
Getting right to it,

02:45.709 --> 02:48.292
I have decided to retire.

02:48.501 --> 02:52.084
As of now, Frieza will be
taking over my forces.

02:52.292 --> 02:57.126
Put another way, the Cold force
will now be the Frieza force.

02:57.334 --> 02:58.667
U-Um...

02:58.876 --> 03:00.959
Nothing will change.

03:01.167 --> 03:05.584
The Saiyans need only work according
to the Frieza force's orders.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.792
If there is any slight difference,

03:08.001 --> 03:12.834
it would be that Frieza is even
more cold-hearted than I am.

03:16.292 --> 03:17.709
Greetings.

03:17.917 --> 03:23.626
I have special expectations
of all of you Saiyans.

03:26.542 --> 03:32.292
To commemorate my installment today,
I brought you some new combat items.

03:32.501 --> 03:35.251
These are newly developed
devices called Scouters.

03:35.459 --> 03:38.542
They are made more compact
than the surveillance Scout Scopes

03:38.751 --> 03:41.751
that you have been using up to now,

03:41.959 --> 03:44.626
and you can also simultaneously
use them as communicators.

03:45.292 --> 03:49.667
It displays your subject's position,
battle power, and range,

03:49.876 --> 03:52.459
just as your Scopes have done up to now.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.042
Oh...?

03:54.251 --> 03:59.542
It appears that a number of Saiyans
are targeting us with weapons.

03:59.751 --> 04:03.459
That Saiyan hiding in there
has a battle power of...

04:04.834 --> 04:05.876
...2,000.

04:06.084 --> 04:08.501
That is quite outstanding.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.209
That is the gist of it.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.291
Handy, are they not?

04:24.292 --> 04:28.834
For now, I will present you with 500 units.

04:29.042 --> 04:33.376
If that is not enough,
please let me know. Goodbye, now.

04:42.501 --> 04:47.626
Ho! Look how big he is getting.

04:47.834 --> 04:50.126
My son, my pride and joy,

04:50.334 --> 04:54.209
your latent battle power is a natural gift.

04:54.417 --> 05:01.917
It is you who will become the king of
the universe, not that monster Frieza.

05:03.917 --> 05:08.126
I look forward to seeing you grow.

05:15.084 --> 05:16.792
Who is this?!

05:17.001 --> 05:19.792
What is he doing in a special capsule?

05:20.001 --> 05:21.626
M-Majesty!

05:22.376 --> 05:26.126
This child is Broly.
He is the son of Colonel Paragus.

05:26.334 --> 05:28.334
Tell me why! This nursery room is here

05:28.542 --> 05:33.667
for exceptional babies
who will become Saiyan elites!

05:33.876 --> 05:39.459
Y-Yes, Majesty. You see...
Broly's latent abilities are especially high.

05:39.667 --> 05:43.751
Are you telling me he has a rating
that rivals my brilliant son?!

05:43.959 --> 05:45.584
Y-Yes, Majesty.

05:45.792 --> 05:50.792
When we gauged him, his level
far exceeded the prince's.

05:51.917 --> 05:57.501
That isn't possible. The prince's own
rating was record-setting!

05:57.709 --> 05:59.084
Give me that!

06:07.792 --> 06:11.292
I am terribly sorry, Majesty!
It appears to have malfunctioned.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.792
I will get a new gauge.

06:13.001 --> 06:14.834
Coming right now.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.667
After further measurement,
his rating is less than half of before.

06:20.876 --> 06:23.876
He did have some anomalous
readings in the past,

06:24.084 --> 06:26.167
but they must have been
due to gauge malfunctions.

06:26.376 --> 06:29.334
But even purging the anomalous data,

06:29.542 --> 06:32.709
Broly's latent abilities
are still substantial.

06:33.959 --> 06:37.959
Once he receives training, he will grow
to become an outstanding warrior

06:38.167 --> 06:40.209
and be a powerful asset for our forces.

06:40.417 --> 06:44.292
He could even be the
legendary Super Saiyan...

06:48.459 --> 06:49.084
--Paragus-<i>sama!</i>
--Please wait!

06:49.084 --> 06:50.834
--Hey! Get away from me!
--Please wait!

06:53.042 --> 06:55.584
Please forgive my discourteousness.

06:55.792 --> 06:58.959
I-I understand that you plan
to launch my son Broly

06:59.167 --> 07:03.001
to an outlying world by pod?

07:03.209 --> 07:04.709
That's right.

07:04.917 --> 07:08.251
Th-That is a job for a lower-class warrior.

07:08.459 --> 07:11.876
If he develops enough
to subjugate that world,

07:12.084 --> 07:15.667
he could become an even stronger warrior.

07:15.876 --> 07:18.584
Dominating worlds and
selling them for a high price--

07:18.792 --> 07:22.251
that is what the warrior Saiyan race does.

07:22.459 --> 07:25.667
His destination, the planetoid Vampa,

07:25.876 --> 07:29.834
is an inhospitable world
without even any people on it.

07:30.042 --> 07:33.376
I do not see how it
could sell for very much.

07:34.251 --> 07:39.292
Your son's latent abilities
are abnormally elevated.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.376
He could even be called a mutant.

07:42.584 --> 07:46.917
Someday, he will be unable
to maintain his mental state,

07:47.126 --> 07:53.667
and will be a danger not just to my
Vegeta forces, but the whole universe.

07:53.876 --> 07:57.084
Be grateful that I am sending
him to another world,

07:57.292 --> 07:58.501
and not just ending his life outright!

07:58.709 --> 08:01.501
H-How could you...?

08:03.042 --> 08:09.334
Y-You are jealous of Broly's latent abilities
which surpass the prince's,

08:09.542 --> 08:11.376
and are just trying to get rid of him!

08:11.584 --> 08:14.167
Say one more word,

08:14.376 --> 08:16.751
and you'll end up dead.

08:18.751 --> 08:21.209
Besides, it's already too late.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.542
The pod has just been launched.

08:23.751 --> 08:24.792
Wha--?

08:32.126 --> 08:32.926
Move!

08:32.958 --> 08:34.708
Wh-What are you doing?

08:37.083 --> 08:40.417
Just a moment! You don't
have permission to launch!

08:41.917 --> 08:44.459
--They're not authorized!
--That's dangerous!

08:44.667 --> 08:46.459
--Return here at once!
Repeat, return here at once!

08:46.459 --> 08:48.126
--Please return at once! --Return here
at once! Repeat, return here at once!

08:48.334 --> 08:51.542
I can't do that. I have to save my son!

08:53.001 --> 08:55.334
King Vegeta boasted of how his prince,

08:55.542 --> 08:58.709
who was born at the same time,
had prodigious latent abilities.

08:58.917 --> 09:05.584
He didn't like the fact that my son
Broly's abilities exceed them.

09:05.792 --> 09:09.959
The pod's destination
is some outlying planet.

09:10.167 --> 09:15.084
A planetoid called Vampa,
orbiting around Star 94.

09:15.292 --> 09:19.751
Why? There aren't any
inhabited planets in that area.

09:19.959 --> 09:23.959
The king's goal is not to claim the planet;

09:24.167 --> 09:27.584
he means to get rid of my son Broly.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.709
O-Oh, my...

09:30.917 --> 09:37.459
Don't worry, Beets. Once I rescue Broly,
we'll go live on some other world.

09:37.667 --> 09:41.542
You'll drop us off there
and head back to Planet Vegeta.

09:41.751 --> 09:43.834
You aren't coming back, sir?

09:44.042 --> 09:48.292
Of course not.
If I did, I'd just be executed.

09:48.501 --> 09:51.751
I will raise Broly to be a mighty warrior,

09:51.959 --> 09:56.542
and someday, take revenge
against King Vegeta!

10:32.709 --> 10:35.459
So that's Planetoid Vampa.

10:35.667 --> 10:40.084
My calculations say that the pod
arrived here two days ago.

10:40.292 --> 10:44.042
Please be alive, Broly.
I'm coming to save you right now.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.626
He should be over there somewhere!

10:49.667 --> 10:54.001
It seemed calmer over where there
was still light. Let's land there!

10:54.209 --> 10:56.667
No, we're going in hard, here!

11:01.751 --> 11:04.084
We have to go look for him,
now! Come with me!

11:04.292 --> 11:06.209
M-Me, too, sir?

11:06.417 --> 11:09.876
Yes. I can't have you taking off
on me while I'm searching.

11:10.084 --> 11:13.376
I wouldn't do that. Please trust me.

11:13.584 --> 11:17.667
Ha! Is there such a thing
as a trustworthy Saiyan?

11:18.876 --> 11:22.334
I understand that there's a new model
of those Scout Scopes.

11:22.542 --> 11:25.792
Frieza, our new leader,
supposedly brought some with him.

11:26.001 --> 11:27.292
I know.

11:27.501 --> 11:30.959
This Frieza guy is said to be
incredibly impressive.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.959
Makes no difference to me now.

11:37.001 --> 11:39.334
Wh-What could that be?

11:57.334 --> 11:59.209
Wh-What are those things?!

11:59.417 --> 12:03.209
You can't be serious!
I'm not even a combatant!

12:08.167 --> 12:11.001
It looks like the night and
the storms come as a set.

12:11.209 --> 12:13.667
Now it's hot, though.

12:13.876 --> 12:17.084
Could that world be a satellite?
It's perfectly full.

12:17.292 --> 12:20.251
Don't look at it too long.
You'll become a Great Ape.

12:20.459 --> 12:25.459
Huh? Oh, right. I've never actually
turned Great Ape before.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.042
Great Apes lose all sense of themselves.

12:28.251 --> 12:32.667
The only time to become one is if you're
cornered with no other way out.

12:34.292 --> 12:35.709
Wh-What is this?

12:36.751 --> 12:41.292
The ground is soft.
This doesn't seem like grass.

12:45.209 --> 12:46.542
Those things...

12:46.751 --> 12:50.209
It looks like they're drinking
something out of the ground.

12:53.584 --> 12:54.876
What is that?!

13:07.042 --> 13:10.667
That wasn't grassland; it's a giant beast.

13:10.876 --> 13:13.667
Those monsters live by
sucking the beasts' blood.

13:13.876 --> 13:17.251
The beasts then live off of those monsters.

13:17.459 --> 13:20.292
Th-This world sure is gross...

13:22.626 --> 13:25.501
The pod! The pod is over there!

13:30.542 --> 13:33.167
He's not here. Where did he go?

13:33.376 --> 13:35.584
Could he have been eaten, maybe?

13:38.167 --> 13:39.417
Over there.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.459
A-Are you sure this is it?

14:11.251 --> 14:13.209
Broly!

14:13.417 --> 14:18.626
You attacked a monster
and ate its leg? That's my boy!

14:18.834 --> 14:20.542
That's Broly?

14:22.334 --> 14:27.126
Battle power 920?!
That's stronger than I am, you know!

14:27.334 --> 14:29.959
Even if he is a gifted child
with a high battle power,

14:30.167 --> 14:33.292
he couldn't have defeated
that monster at 920.

14:36.042 --> 14:40.292
Look here. His suit is a bit
stretched and baggy.

14:40.501 --> 14:44.626
He must have looked at that
full moon and turned Great Ape.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.042
Let's hurry and leave this world.

14:47.251 --> 14:49.709
It got pretty roughed up, huh?

14:51.334 --> 14:53.001
O-Oh, no...!

14:53.209 --> 14:54.048
What is it?

14:54.167 --> 14:57.042
The main floater is cracked!

14:57.251 --> 14:59.417
You mean you can't fix it?

14:59.626 --> 15:03.126
Absolutely not. Without a new floater...

15:03.334 --> 15:06.084
What? You mean we're stuck here?!

15:06.292 --> 15:10.001
We can't even radio for help like this.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.709
There's enough food and water for ten days.

15:12.917 --> 15:16.084
Do you think anyone will
find us in just ten days?!

15:17.126 --> 15:21.126
We really shouldn't have
crash landed after all.

15:22.042 --> 15:25.209
This will save one person's worth of food.

15:31.001 --> 15:33.209
"Five years later"

15:33.959 --> 15:36.876
Bardock-<i>san</i>... Bardock-<i>san!</i>

15:39.251 --> 15:40.209
What?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.751
We're almost to Planet Vegeta.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.542
It's been a long time, huh?

15:44.751 --> 15:45.751
Yeah.

15:46.376 --> 15:48.126
What do you suppose this is about--

15:48.334 --> 15:51.876
ordering the Saiyans to hurry
and assemble at Planet Vegeta?

15:52.084 --> 15:54.251
Apparently, that Frieza bastard ordered it.

15:54.459 --> 15:56.417
Take off your Scouter. They'll hear you.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.126
Ah, that's right!

16:03.042 --> 16:04.042
Look at that.

16:04.167 --> 16:07.001
All the others are coming back home, too.

16:07.209 --> 16:08.709
Look over there.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.584
That's Frieza's ship.

16:12.334 --> 16:15.876
There's still some time left,
but it's already standing by?

16:18.209 --> 16:20.292
You don't think it's strange?

16:20.501 --> 16:21.792
If he just wants to speak to us,

16:22.001 --> 16:25.709
he doesn't need to bring us back to
the planet; he could just use the radio.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.584
If he wants to give us new weapons,

16:27.792 --> 16:30.126
there's no point in hurrying
to gather us together.

16:32.376 --> 16:35.709
There really is something
fishy going on here.

16:35.917 --> 16:38.834
Huh? What do you mean, fishy?

16:39.042 --> 16:41.876
Conquering planets and selling them

16:42.084 --> 16:45.709
has always been the livelihood
of the warrior Saiyan race.

16:45.917 --> 16:52.292
Then Frieza's father, Cold,
subjugated us by force

16:52.501 --> 16:54.459
and placed us under his rule.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.417
That was a long time ago, right?

16:57.626 --> 17:00.209
Do you think we're getting along well now?

17:00.417 --> 17:04.001
Well, there aren't any Saiyans
that like Frieza.

17:07.001 --> 17:10.376
And Frieza likely feels
the same way about Saiyans.

17:10.584 --> 17:11.323
Huh?

17:11.334 --> 17:14.376
Right now,
the Frieza force has grown larger.

17:14.584 --> 17:18.876
They could probably get by
even without us annoying Saiyans around.

17:22.209 --> 17:28.001
Y-You're not saying he's planning
to exterminate us, are you?

17:28.209 --> 17:30.709
I'm just saying, maybe.

17:32.251 --> 17:35.501
O-Oh, come on, Bardock-<i>san.</i>

17:37.417 --> 17:41.292
Yo, Bardock! Made it back alive, huh?

17:41.501 --> 17:42.542
Hey,

17:42.751 --> 17:45.334
do you know the reason
for this summons order?

17:45.542 --> 17:50.042
Beats me. Maybe they found a fairly
big-league world to go after.

17:50.251 --> 17:53.542
Something that will take
all of us to conquer.

17:53.751 --> 17:56.584
That's it! That's what this is.

17:56.792 --> 17:59.501
Come to think of it, the people
that report directly to Frieza

17:59.709 --> 18:03.167
were going around asking
about the Super Saiyan.

18:04.209 --> 18:09.042
The Super Saiyan? Like in the legend?

18:09.251 --> 18:10.542
That's why!

18:12.376 --> 18:14.542
The Super Saiyan...

18:14.751 --> 18:17.292
...and Super Saiyan God...

18:17.501 --> 18:20.959
We've looked into them,
but they appear to just be legends.

18:21.167 --> 18:24.542
That is about what I was thinking.

18:24.751 --> 18:30.334
I cannot afford the least bit of anxiety,
so I had to make sure.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.209
So then, are you canceling the attack?

18:34.167 --> 18:35.751
You must be joking.

18:37.001 --> 18:40.459
Not after they have all assembled together.

18:41.417 --> 18:47.126
This is the perfect opportunity to be rid
of them, planet and all, is it not?

18:48.501 --> 18:50.501
Welcome home, Bardock-<i>san!</i>

18:50.709 --> 18:51.626
Yeah.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.209
Yo, I'm home, Gine.

18:56.417 --> 18:58.417
Huh? Bardock!

18:58.626 --> 19:00.709
Things sure are buzzing in town.

19:00.917 --> 19:03.959
Yeah, since everyone has come home.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.251
Where's Raditz?

19:05.459 --> 19:06.876
He's a combatant now.

19:07.084 --> 19:09.684
He's teamed with Prince Vegeta,
and they're off on some other world.

19:09.792 --> 19:12.167
They haven't come back yet, though.

19:12.376 --> 19:14.834
Prince Vegeta, huh?

19:15.042 --> 19:18.417
There's a piece of work to be stuck with.

19:18.626 --> 19:19.751
What about Kakarot?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.959
Still in the child-rearing capsule?

19:22.167 --> 19:22.834
Yeah.

19:23.042 --> 19:26.376
It's just about time to let him out,
though. Want to see him?

19:30.959 --> 19:32.084
He's small.

19:32.292 --> 19:34.584
He seems to be the slow-starter type.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.876
He looks just like you, though, doesn't he?

19:37.084 --> 19:39.667
Especially your distinctive hairstyle.

19:44.501 --> 19:47.084
After dark, I'm going to go steal a pod.

19:47.959 --> 19:49.959
We're going to send him to another world.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.501
Huh? You're kidding, right?

19:52.709 --> 19:54.376
No, I'm serious.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.709
Why would you go and do
something like that now?

19:57.917 --> 20:00.042
He hasn't even learned to talk yet!

20:00.251 --> 20:05.417
With Kakarot's latent abilities,
he's destined to be sent away anyhow.

20:05.626 --> 20:09.209
So, we're going to see to it that
it's at least a better planet.

20:09.417 --> 20:13.292
But it's still too soon.

20:13.501 --> 20:15.584
There may not be any time left.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.001
Time?

20:17.209 --> 20:23.001
Frieza is afraid of the legendary
Super Saiyan appearing.

20:23.209 --> 20:30.084
Super Saiyan? But that's...
only a fable, isn't it?

20:30.292 --> 20:34.542
Yeah. But he can't help
but be bothered by it.

20:34.751 --> 20:37.626
And he's up to no good.

20:39.251 --> 20:43.292
I get the feeling that death is on its way.

20:49.001 --> 20:51.542
On second thought, let's not do this.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.292
Don't worry.

20:53.501 --> 20:56.709
If I turn out to be wrong,
I'll go rescue him right away.

20:58.959 --> 21:02.167
In that case, why don't the three of us
run away someplace?

21:02.376 --> 21:06.584
We can't. We'd be found out
on their Scouters in no time.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.459
But...

21:08.667 --> 21:10.917
...why would you go to such lengths?

21:11.126 --> 21:16.001
It's not like a Saiyan man
to worry about his children.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.834
Maybe it's because I'm always
in the middle of a battle,

21:20.042 --> 21:23.834
and I'd like to save
something instead for once.

21:24.751 --> 21:28.542
Especially someone deemed to be
a lower-class warrior--

21:28.751 --> 21:30.376
my son.

21:34.792 --> 21:38.751
I've programmed in a distant
planet named earth.

21:38.959 --> 21:43.334
It's a world inhabited by people with
lower technology and combat levels.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.167
I think even you'll be
able to survive there.

21:46.376 --> 21:48.876
Moreover, it's not of much worth,

21:49.084 --> 21:52.584
so the chances that it will be
targeted by Frieza are also low.

21:52.792 --> 21:54.417
If Bardock is overthinking the matter,

21:54.626 --> 21:56.626
we'll come and get you right away, okay?

21:56.834 --> 22:00.167
Listen, you survive, no matter what!

22:02.376 --> 22:04.167
We'll see you later!

22:07.542 --> 22:08.751
Bye.

22:15.626 --> 22:19.709
Kakarot!!

22:38.709 --> 22:42.917
Without the Saiyans,
our fighting force will be cut in half.

22:43.126 --> 22:45.751
Even at that,
we will still be able to get by.

22:45.959 --> 22:49.292
They have no choice but to
pretend to be submissive,

22:49.501 --> 22:51.876
but they may bare their fangs at any time.

22:52.084 --> 22:53.126
Oh?

22:53.334 --> 22:57.751
They are, after all, a warrior race.

22:57.959 --> 23:02.959
One must sweep the dust away
before it can be stirred up.

24:11.292 --> 24:13.792
I feel much better now.

24:23.876 --> 24:25.251
What was that?!

24:25.459 --> 24:26.626
What's wrong?

24:26.834 --> 24:28.751
A message from the Frieza force.

24:28.959 --> 24:32.709
A meteor collided with Planet Vegeta...

24:32.917 --> 24:36.126
I-It was obliterated...!

24:36.542 --> 24:38.084
Wh-What?!

24:38.292 --> 24:41.251
Then most of the Saiyans were wiped out?

24:41.459 --> 24:44.792
Why didn't they detect
the meteor approaching?

24:46.584 --> 24:51.709
We're lucky, aren't we--ignoring
Frieza's order to gather like that?

24:51.917 --> 24:55.209
Tch, I never got to be King Vegeta.

24:55.876 --> 24:58.376
Vegeta, you have a brother, don't you?

24:58.584 --> 25:01.501
Come to think of it, what became of him?

25:01.709 --> 25:03.751
Not that I'm interested.

25:04.917 --> 25:06.751
Raditz, you had a younger
brother, too, right?

25:06.959 --> 25:10.667
Hmph, he was determined
to be a lower-class warrior,

25:10.876 --> 25:13.667
so he was in a home child-rearing capsule.

25:13.876 --> 25:15.209
Disgraceful.

25:16.167 --> 25:22.126
Hmm? My mother contacted me
saying he was sent off in a pod.

25:22.334 --> 25:24.501
It doesn't matter to me, though.

26:04.417 --> 26:06.834
"Present Day"

26:20.667 --> 26:24.126
Mmm, delicious!

26:24.334 --> 26:29.209
Ah, the food! The air!
This cottage really is beyond terrific!

26:29.417 --> 26:31.709
Right, Bulma-<i>san?</i>

26:31.917 --> 26:33.501
Nice, isn't it?

26:50.542 --> 26:53.126
We had it built many years ago.

26:53.334 --> 26:57.834
Out here on this unoccupied island,
1,600 kilometers south of Metro West,

26:58.042 --> 27:00.751
they can cut loose a
little and still be fine.

27:02.417 --> 27:06.292
They're likely to destroy Metro West
before long otherwise.

27:16.209 --> 27:18.709
Keep it down!!

27:19.542 --> 27:22.542
Stop fighting so loud!

27:28.751 --> 27:31.542
By the way, Goku-<i>san</i>...

27:31.751 --> 27:35.209
Why do you seek even greater strength?

27:35.417 --> 27:39.251
Is it because you are after
the position of Destroyer?

27:39.917 --> 27:43.042
What was that? I can't let that slide.

27:43.251 --> 27:44.417
No, it ain't.

27:44.626 --> 27:47.251
I don't wanna be anything like that.

27:47.459 --> 27:49.751
<i>"That"</i> was over the line.

27:49.959 --> 27:53.292
When I saw how ridiculously strong
the guys in other universes were

27:53.501 --> 27:56.501
in that all-universe tournament earlier,

27:57.542 --> 27:59.626
it got me fired...

27:59.834 --> 28:01.334
...up!

28:01.542 --> 28:05.667
You mean your sights are
already set on other universes?

28:05.876 --> 28:08.042
You're as big a buffoon as ever.

28:08.251 --> 28:12.876
Then Vegeta-<i>san</i>, why do you seek
even greater strength?

28:13.084 --> 28:14.417
Frieza!

28:14.626 --> 28:18.334
This dumbass right here
decided to bring that devil

28:18.542 --> 28:20.459
of all people back to life, that's why!

28:20.667 --> 28:26.792
Hey, if it wasn't for Frieza,
our 7th Universe might not still be here.

28:27.001 --> 28:28.584
Oh, is that right?

28:28.792 --> 28:31.334
Yeah. He helped save us.

28:31.542 --> 28:35.459
Idiot! He was only thinking
of himself in doing so.

28:38.709 --> 28:41.584
You saw Frieza when he came
to earth before, remember?

28:41.792 --> 28:44.792
He accomplished that much
in that short amount of time.

28:46.751 --> 28:50.917
You're saying he might get even
more powerful and come to defeat us?

28:51.126 --> 28:52.459
No doubt about it.

28:52.667 --> 28:57.001
I don't know. Even though we
brought him back to life?

28:57.959 --> 29:01.834
You idiot! Do you think
he feels obligated to us?!

29:02.042 --> 29:05.209
How many times are you
gonna call me an idiot?

29:06.292 --> 29:10.876
As often as I want to, idiot!!

29:12.417 --> 29:15.251
Hmm? It's Trunks.

29:17.459 --> 29:18.659
What is it?

29:20.876 --> 29:23.667
It looks like a burglar
broke into your lab.

29:23.876 --> 29:26.167
Huh? What was stolen?

29:26.376 --> 29:28.334
I'll check the security video.

29:28.542 --> 29:29.876
Let's see...

29:31.626 --> 29:33.959
The Dragon Balls that you collected

29:34.167 --> 29:36.459
and the Dragon Radar.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.792
They took what?!

29:40.126 --> 29:43.626
Like I told you, you need better security.

29:43.834 --> 29:45.917
You know what, Mama?

29:46.126 --> 29:48.292
The burglars that show up--

29:49.584 --> 29:52.292
they were wearing clothes like Papa's.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.584
Huh?!

30:00.209 --> 30:02.251
Thank you, Trunks.

30:03.292 --> 30:05.209
The culprits are Frieza's men.

30:05.417 --> 30:07.709
He deliberately used some men
with lower battle powers

30:07.917 --> 30:10.251
so we wouldn't notice them.

30:10.459 --> 30:14.626
Frieza sure is relentless in
going after the Dragon Balls.

30:14.834 --> 30:18.792
I wonder what sort of wish
he could have at this point.

30:19.001 --> 30:22.001
He ain't able to wish for anything
beyond Shenron's power,

30:22.209 --> 30:25.459
so wishing to be made the strongest
in the universe is out.

30:25.667 --> 30:29.459
That should be obvious;
his wish is to never die.

30:29.667 --> 30:30.459
Yeah, but,

30:30.667 --> 30:33.959
not dying is pointless if you still lose.

30:34.167 --> 30:38.626
Even so, there's a chance that
someday, he'll surpass us!

30:38.834 --> 30:40.334
There is?

30:41.917 --> 30:45.459
I had six of the Dragon Balls.

30:45.667 --> 30:49.001
They're sure to go where
the last one is to find it.

30:49.209 --> 30:50.209
Where is it?

30:50.292 --> 30:51.709
The ice continent.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.834
I don't like the cold, so I was
putting off going to get it.

30:55.042 --> 30:56.917
The ice continent?

30:58.042 --> 30:59.709
Would you like to come, too?

30:59.917 --> 31:02.376
Hmph, I'm taking a nap.

31:02.584 --> 31:06.042
Oh, my, does that not sound like fun?

31:06.251 --> 31:07.751
Anything good to eat there?

31:07.959 --> 31:09.876
I wouldn't count on it.

31:10.084 --> 31:11.959
Then count me out.

31:12.751 --> 31:14.709
Terrific! Then here,

31:14.917 --> 31:16.751
look after Bulla.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.626
Thank you!

31:19.834 --> 31:22.626
Hey! Why, you...!

31:26.417 --> 31:29.209
The ice continent is cold.

31:31.209 --> 31:33.626
We'll have to buy some
cold-weather gear on the way.

31:33.834 --> 31:37.167
Why were you collecting the Dragon Balls?

31:38.459 --> 31:40.251
Never you mind.

31:40.459 --> 31:42.001
Tell me!

31:44.126 --> 31:48.417
I was going to make myself younger.
About five years' worth.

31:48.626 --> 31:51.834
You were gonna use the Dragon Balls
for something that unimportant?!

31:52.042 --> 31:56.084
You hush! You Saiyans wouldn't understand!

31:56.292 --> 31:57.376
Hmph.

31:57.584 --> 32:01.626
Why only five years? Why not any longer?

32:01.834 --> 32:04.584
It would seem unnatural to become
young again all at once, right?!

32:04.792 --> 32:07.084
I'm sure people would say...

32:07.292 --> 32:12.626
"Oh? Bulma-<i>san</i>, you suddenly
look young again, don't you?

32:12.834 --> 32:17.501
I wonder, have you had some work done?"

32:17.709 --> 32:19.292
...and so forth.

32:19.501 --> 32:23.584
Hold on. You've <i>already</i> been using
the Dragon Balls from time to time, huh?

32:49.584 --> 32:51.126
Frieza-<i>sama,</i>

32:51.334 --> 32:54.042
along with the Dragon Radar,

32:54.251 --> 32:58.626
Vegeta's wife was already in possession
of six of the Dragon Balls,

32:58.834 --> 33:00.542
so our search team obtained them,

33:00.751 --> 33:04.501
and they are now heading to the site
of the last one to locate it.

33:04.709 --> 33:07.292
That is marvelous news.

33:07.501 --> 33:11.709
So, shall we start up the ship
and head for earth?

33:11.917 --> 33:16.251
No, we can do that once they
find all seven Dragon Balls.

33:16.459 --> 33:19.167
It would be dangerous to rush there
and arrive too early.

33:19.376 --> 33:25.042
Even without Scouters, they can tell
if a high battle power is approaching.

33:27.417 --> 33:29.042
Understood.

33:29.251 --> 33:32.376
You have written down
how to make the wish, yes?

33:32.584 --> 33:34.959
Yes, to the letter.

33:35.167 --> 33:37.084
By the way...

33:37.292 --> 33:38.751
What is it, Kikono?

33:38.959 --> 33:45.292
N-Nothing... just... once
the Dragon Balls are gathered,

33:45.501 --> 33:51.084
I was wondering, Frieza-<i>sama</i>,
what sort of wish would you be making?

33:51.292 --> 33:54.751
Would it be to have an immortal body,
as you have mentioned before?

33:56.501 --> 33:57.584
No, it would not.

33:57.792 --> 33:58.834
Huh?

34:00.126 --> 34:02.709
I realized something
when I was in earth's hell

34:02.917 --> 34:05.209
and rendered unable to move--

34:05.417 --> 34:07.376
that not being able to either die or move

34:07.584 --> 34:09.708
was nothing but misery.

34:09.917 --> 34:13.876
Then... perhaps,

34:14.083 --> 34:19.208
to not ever take any damage...
or something?

34:19.417 --> 34:23.667
That would make the game no fun to play.

34:23.876 --> 34:27.833
Hmm... What could it be...?

34:29.667 --> 34:31.042
You will never guess.

34:31.251 --> 34:35.876
You wish to increase your height, correct?

34:36.501 --> 34:40.876
Huh?! B-Berryblue-san!
How could you say that?!

34:41.083 --> 34:43.708
There are so many soldiers
who have called Frieza-<i>sama</i>

34:43.917 --> 34:48.708
a "pipsqueak" behind his back
who have been eliminated, after all.

34:48.917 --> 34:51.708
Well deduced, Berryblue-<i>san</i>.

34:52.501 --> 34:54.083
You are correct.

34:54.292 --> 34:55.501
Huh?!

34:56.458 --> 34:58.501
That was the right answer?!

34:58.709 --> 35:01.501
Can you promise not to tell anyone?

35:01.709 --> 35:04.126
O-Of course!

35:05.042 --> 35:07.542
I would like...

35:07.751 --> 35:11.792
...to grow by about... five centimeters.

35:12.001 --> 35:13.626
Huh?!

35:13.834 --> 35:15.542
Th-Then,

35:15.751 --> 35:19.209
if you adopted your second transformation,

35:19.417 --> 35:21.834
would that not be sufficiently tall?

35:22.042 --> 35:28.751
Oh, no! I wish to be taller
in my regular and final forms.

35:28.959 --> 35:33.251
Then, why only a mere five centimeters?

35:33.459 --> 35:38.501
It would seem unnatural to become
tall all at once, right?!

35:40.376 --> 35:44.417
I want it to look like I am still growing.

35:44.626 --> 35:49.334
I-I see...

35:56.042 --> 35:59.251
There's nobody around here.

35:59.459 --> 36:04.376
There just aren't that many folks
with a battle power of at least 1,000.

36:04.584 --> 36:05.876
What choice do we have?

36:06.084 --> 36:09.209
Our orders were to go find as
many combatants as we could

36:09.417 --> 36:11.209
to rebuild the force.

36:11.417 --> 36:13.459
There already were a bunch
of combatants, weren't there?

36:13.667 --> 36:16.167
Rumor has it that they were
fighting too timidly,

36:16.376 --> 36:19.334
so Frieza-<i>sama</i> killed them all.

36:20.417 --> 36:21.251
Tch.

36:21.459 --> 36:24.584
Cheelai, why did you join the Frieza force?

36:25.334 --> 36:28.959
It got out that I stole
a Galactic Patrol spaceship.

36:29.167 --> 36:32.876
They can't touch me if I'm
in the Frieza force, right?

36:33.084 --> 36:33.751
You're scum.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.042
Yeah, well...

36:36.251 --> 36:38.876
Lemo-<i>san</i>, you've been in the Frieza
force the whole time, right?

36:39.084 --> 36:41.209
Have you ever met Frieza-<i>sama?</i>

36:41.417 --> 36:45.751
I'm not a combatant; I've only ever
seen him on the station.

36:45.959 --> 36:47.584
I hear he's teeny.

36:48.584 --> 36:53.459
Don't ever say anything like that again.
Not if you want to live.

36:53.667 --> 36:55.042
All right.

36:55.251 --> 36:58.376
He's killed some people before
just for having bad breath.

36:58.584 --> 37:01.501
Still, if he's putting women
and old men to work,

37:01.709 --> 37:04.459
the Frieza force might have
just about had it, huh?

37:06.834 --> 37:08.167
What's that?

37:08.376 --> 37:09.584
A distress signal!

37:09.792 --> 37:13.501
What's more, it's an awfully
old type of Frieza force signal.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.109
It's coming from that world over there.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.626
If we rescue them,
we may get a special bonus.

37:19.542 --> 37:21.917
All right, let's get down there!

37:29.209 --> 37:30.309
There's no one here.

37:30.334 --> 37:31.501
There, you see?

37:31.709 --> 37:33.751
I'll try using my Scouter.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.376
Are you the Frieza force?

37:46.459 --> 37:51.667
Is that a tail?
That means, y-you're a Saiyan!

37:51.876 --> 37:53.334
"Saiyan"?

37:54.501 --> 37:59.334
Yeah. I'm Paragus.
I'm a Frieza force Saiyan.

37:59.542 --> 38:01.042
So that distress signal...

38:01.251 --> 38:04.959
Yeah, that was me.
My spaceship broke down.

38:06.001 --> 38:13.084
I've waited an unbelievably long time,
and now, I'm saved!

38:13.792 --> 38:17.167
Battle power 4,200. Great.

38:17.376 --> 38:18.709
Are you alone?

38:18.917 --> 38:20.334
No, there's one other--

38:27.001 --> 38:30.167
Broly!!

38:44.542 --> 38:47.376
This is my son, Broly.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.251
N-No way!

38:51.459 --> 38:52.268
What?

38:52.334 --> 38:56.792
H-His battle power is... b-beyond measure!

38:57.001 --> 39:00.834
Hmm? Ridiculous. That's not possible--

39:03.209 --> 39:06.459
Hop in! Frieza-<i>sama</i> will be delighted!

39:12.209 --> 39:16.001
Let's see... What was your name again?

39:16.209 --> 39:17.584
Broly.

39:19.001 --> 39:20.959
You want one of these, Broly?

39:21.167 --> 39:24.709
They're good. Here.

39:27.459 --> 39:30.167
You have to unwrap it first!

39:34.209 --> 39:35.959
Eat it, Broly.

39:41.751 --> 39:44.876
Ha-ha! Well? It's good, right?

39:46.042 --> 39:48.709
What, not even a thank you?

39:48.917 --> 39:51.751
Tell her thanks, Broly.

39:51.959 --> 39:54.501
Thank you... very much.

39:54.709 --> 39:58.584
That's formal. Just "thank you" is fine.

39:58.792 --> 40:02.334
Th-Thank you.

40:02.542 --> 40:03.626
Sure!

40:06.792 --> 40:09.709
I have brought them, Frieza-<i>sama.</i>

40:09.917 --> 40:11.792
Ho...

40:12.917 --> 40:16.542
Are you really a Saiyan?

40:19.667 --> 40:22.042
You do not appear to have a tail.

40:22.251 --> 40:23.251
No, sir.

40:23.417 --> 40:27.792
The effects of transforming into
a Great Ape, which is a Saiyan trait,

40:28.001 --> 40:30.292
caused him to lose all sense of himself.

40:30.501 --> 40:32.876
Which is why I cut off his tail.

40:33.084 --> 40:36.709
Has he lost his sense of himself since?

40:36.917 --> 40:39.042
Yes, sir, on rare occasions.

40:39.251 --> 40:42.709
So you are saying that it does
sometimes still happen?

40:42.917 --> 40:47.001
P-Please do not worry. When that happens...

40:47.209 --> 40:52.084
...using this remote control, electricity
runs through the device around Broly's neck.

40:52.292 --> 40:55.917
It is not a strong current,
but it allows me to control him.

40:56.126 --> 40:57.959
I see.

40:59.626 --> 41:01.917
What is your name?

41:05.334 --> 41:07.292
It is Broly, sir.

41:09.167 --> 41:14.001
I see you still have a tremendous level
of yet-untapped battle power.

41:14.209 --> 41:19.584
I am certain that he can be of
great use to you, Frieza-<i>sama</i>.

41:19.792 --> 41:22.709
This is indeed an unexpected bounty.

41:22.917 --> 41:27.959
Berryblue-<i>san</i>, please offer a reward
to the two who found him.

41:30.459 --> 41:32.292
Th-This much?!

41:32.501 --> 41:34.667
--Thank you very much!
--Thank you very much!

41:36.001 --> 41:38.617
I understand that you were unable
to escape from that barren planet

41:38.626 --> 41:41.209
for quite a long time.

41:41.417 --> 41:42.459
Yes, sir.

41:42.667 --> 41:49.334
Are you aware that your home world
of Planet Vegeta is no longer there?

41:49.542 --> 41:56.209
Yes, sir. I heard so on the way here.
But none of that matters now.

41:56.417 --> 41:57.751
It's just...

41:57.959 --> 42:00.334
Vengeance, yes?

42:02.834 --> 42:08.917
Paragus-<i>san</i>, did you know that
King Vegeta's son, Vegeta IV,

42:09.126 --> 42:10.709
is still alive?

42:10.917 --> 42:13.126
Wh-What?!

42:13.334 --> 42:15.251
Prince Vegeta?!

42:15.459 --> 42:19.334
Why... that miserable Vegeta...!

42:20.126 --> 42:23.959
Allow me to lend you some assistance
with your vengeance.

42:25.001 --> 42:28.876
Berryblue-<i>san</i>, once these two
have had a shower,

42:29.084 --> 42:32.001
please arrange for some
battle uniforms for them.

42:33.126 --> 42:34.542
Yes, sir.

42:37.459 --> 42:42.834
I had not meant to fight this
time, but now...

42:43.042 --> 42:46.792
This is starting to get interesting.

42:54.251 --> 42:55.417
Yo!

42:55.626 --> 42:57.667
You're looking freshly
scrubbed, aren't you?

42:57.876 --> 42:59.376
Come eat with us.

42:59.584 --> 43:02.376
Broly, where's your battle uniform?

43:02.917 --> 43:05.709
It's... hard to move in it.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.001
It's not once you put it on.

43:08.209 --> 43:11.001
Do whatever you like, though.

43:11.209 --> 43:14.459
But get rid of that fur around your waist.

43:14.667 --> 43:16.917
It's dirty, and it stinks.

43:17.917 --> 43:18.959
No!

43:21.834 --> 43:26.084
O-Oh, so it's something important to you.

43:29.251 --> 43:31.542
This... is my--

43:31.751 --> 43:33.917
Broly, we're here to eat,

43:34.126 --> 43:35.917
not to talk.

43:39.042 --> 43:41.667
You can at least let him
talk that much, can't you?

43:41.876 --> 43:44.334
I'd appreciate it if you didn't butt in.

43:44.917 --> 43:45.726
Huh?!

43:45.834 --> 43:46.917
Now, now...

43:47.126 --> 43:48.042
Hey,

43:48.251 --> 43:50.459
are you new?

43:52.084 --> 43:55.709
It can't be any fun hanging out
with this sour bunch.

43:55.917 --> 43:59.626
I'm the only combatant aboard
this ship for this operation

43:59.834 --> 44:01.917
who's any good.

44:02.917 --> 44:04.042
Come on over with me.

44:04.251 --> 44:08.167
Let go of me! I told you no, didn't I?!

44:08.376 --> 44:10.834
How about if I buy you a drink?

44:11.042 --> 44:12.751
Shut up, old man!

44:16.084 --> 44:17.292
Stop, Broly!

44:17.501 --> 44:20.667
What do you want?
You got a problem with me?

44:22.917 --> 44:23.820
I do.

44:23.959 --> 44:26.542
What did you say?!

44:26.751 --> 44:29.876
Wha--?! Damn it! Damn it!

44:30.834 --> 44:31.917
Broly!

44:57.917 --> 44:59.501
Are you okay?!

45:00.917 --> 45:01.917
You!

45:02.042 --> 45:05.167
You went too far!
How could you do that to him?!

45:05.376 --> 45:08.626
If I hadn't stopped him,
he might have killed him.

45:08.834 --> 45:12.042
Just how did you raise him?

45:12.251 --> 45:16.334
Hmph, while we are in your debt,
we don't seem to see eye to eye.

45:16.542 --> 45:19.001
From now on, please do not
come near my son.

45:21.417 --> 45:22.417
Tch.

45:24.292 --> 45:25.542
Paragus-<i>san</i>,

45:25.751 --> 45:27.959
Frieza-<i>sama</i> is calling for you.

45:28.167 --> 45:31.709
Frieza-<i>sama?</i> Yes, we will
come right away. Broly!

45:31.917 --> 45:34.667
No, just you, Paragus-<i>san.</i>

45:34.876 --> 45:37.167
Huh? Oh, I see.

45:37.376 --> 45:40.376
Broly, I'll be right back. Wait here.

45:41.542 --> 45:45.584
My dead creep of a father
might be better than this guy.

45:46.667 --> 45:47.667
Huh?

45:51.626 --> 45:53.876
Oh, you swiped that?

45:54.084 --> 45:56.792
This is what I think of this thing!

46:01.709 --> 46:04.584
Broly, thank you for earlier.

46:10.334 --> 46:14.001
Oh, you want some water?
Let me have that.

46:17.542 --> 46:18.626
Here.

46:24.584 --> 46:26.626
What is this?

46:26.834 --> 46:29.001
Huh? It's ordinary water.

46:29.209 --> 46:32.167
Haven't you ever had water before?

46:42.292 --> 46:44.042
That was good.

46:46.667 --> 46:49.084
This is Ba's ear.

46:50.001 --> 46:52.417
Oh, you mean the fur?

46:52.626 --> 46:56.334
Me and Ba got along well.

46:56.542 --> 47:01.209
Ba is a big, big, beast,
bigger than this ship.

47:01.417 --> 47:05.376
"Ba" is the sound Ba made,
so that's what I called Ba.

47:05.584 --> 47:07.126
Ba was scary,

47:07.334 --> 47:13.626
but day after day, while doing
training by dodging Ba's attacks,

47:13.834 --> 47:16.126
we became friends.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.709
We became good friends.

47:25.667 --> 47:28.501
So Ba was the first friend you ever made.

47:28.709 --> 47:36.292
But Dad was angry. Being friends
with Ba isn't training. So then...

47:38.292 --> 47:43.292
Dad shot Ba's ear with a gun,
making Ba angry.

47:43.501 --> 47:47.376
Ba never became friends with me again.

47:48.334 --> 47:53.126
That's why I decided to stay with Ba's ear.

47:56.251 --> 47:58.542
You sure talked a lot, Broly.

47:58.751 --> 48:03.209
This is the first time I've ever heard
such a pure story around here.

48:03.417 --> 48:06.751
You seriously are innocent.

48:06.959 --> 48:11.042
I'll bet you don't even like to
fight, do you?

48:12.459 --> 48:15.334
You just had an incredible gift
for rough-and-tumble fighting,

48:15.542 --> 48:18.959
so your old man forced you
to train, didn't he?

48:19.167 --> 48:21.167
That father of yours!

48:21.376 --> 48:25.459
He only thinks of you as
a powerful weapon, doesn't he?

48:25.667 --> 48:27.917
One used for vengeance and getting ahead.

48:28.126 --> 48:32.251
Probably. Your old man is the worst.

48:32.459 --> 48:35.501
You don't have to do everything
that guy tells you.

48:38.459 --> 48:42.126
It's not right for you to say
bad things about Dad.

48:48.251 --> 48:50.334
It should be around here somewhere...

48:52.459 --> 48:54.709
You dumbass! Hurry and pull me up!

48:54.917 --> 48:56.251
Sorry!

49:03.626 --> 49:05.542
Found it! I found it!

49:08.292 --> 49:10.542
The planet called earth
to which we are about to go

49:10.751 --> 49:13.876
will have Vegeta and one other Saiyan.

49:14.084 --> 49:17.251
I would like to see Broly-<i>san</i>'s power.

49:17.459 --> 49:21.042
The innate strength that Broly
possesses is super-prodigious.

49:21.251 --> 49:23.876
We will achieve our long-sought vengeance!

49:24.084 --> 49:28.459
Incidentally, you are free to do
with Vegeta whatever you wish...

49:29.667 --> 49:35.751
But please allow me to finish off
the other Saiyan named Son Goku.

49:35.959 --> 49:41.376
Killing Son Goku has long been
a dream of mine, you see!

49:42.459 --> 49:44.376
As you wish.

49:44.584 --> 49:48.459
Frieza-<i>sama</i>, we have collected
all seven Dragon Balls!

49:48.667 --> 49:51.167
Oh, that is outstanding!

50:02.917 --> 50:04.917
Down there! Frieza's men!

50:05.126 --> 50:08.042
Tch, they've already found the last one?

50:09.834 --> 50:12.167
That aircraft looks like
trouble, doesn't it?

50:12.376 --> 50:15.459
Could those be the Saiyans that
Kikono-<i>sama</i> warned us about?

50:17.917 --> 50:20.709
Whoo! Now this is cold!

50:20.917 --> 50:22.837
Whis-<i>san</i>, I'm surprised
it doesn't bother you.

50:22.917 --> 50:26.334
The vacuum of space is even colder.

50:29.417 --> 50:30.309
Y-Yikes!

50:30.417 --> 50:33.751
The Scouter's readings just spiked!
It's the Saiyans!

50:33.959 --> 50:35.376
We're getting out of here!

50:45.959 --> 50:46.894
Hey, you!

50:46.959 --> 50:49.459
Come on out and give back the Dragon Balls!

50:51.167 --> 50:52.209
Wh-What do we do?

50:52.417 --> 50:56.126
Wh-What do we do?
If we don't give them back,

50:56.334 --> 50:58.542
he'll kill us.

50:59.626 --> 51:03.292
If we <i>do</i> give them back,
Frieza-<i>sama</i> will kill us!

51:24.792 --> 51:25.792
Well, well,

51:25.876 --> 51:27.792
here comes Frieza's entrance.

51:28.001 --> 51:30.667
Hmm? What's that?

51:30.876 --> 51:34.126
It ain't just Frieza. There's some other...

51:34.334 --> 51:36.376
...out-of-this-world guy in there.

52:06.334 --> 52:08.417
Those are Saiyans, aren't they?

52:14.209 --> 52:17.292
Vegeta! There's no doubt about it.

52:20.167 --> 52:22.167
He looks just like the king.

52:25.959 --> 52:28.376
What are you doing here, Frieza?

52:28.584 --> 52:30.501
I am sure you already know.

52:30.709 --> 52:34.334
Having a wish granted by the Dragon Balls.

52:38.959 --> 52:40.834
What are those ball-like things?

52:41.042 --> 52:42.042
Beats me.

52:42.167 --> 52:44.042
Go ask someone.

52:44.584 --> 52:48.167
Hey! Go get the Dragon Balls back!

52:48.376 --> 52:50.584
It appears that we have a larger problem.

52:50.792 --> 52:51.531
Huh?

52:51.584 --> 52:55.876
I suppose you might call it
the nature of their warrior race.

52:56.084 --> 52:58.334
Frieza, who are those two?

52:58.542 --> 53:01.376
These are the newest enlistees
to the Frieza force,

53:01.584 --> 53:05.084
Broly-<i>san</i> and his father...

53:05.292 --> 53:06.417
...Paragus!

53:06.626 --> 53:12.501
There you have it. As you appear to have
noticed, they, like you, are Saiyans.

53:12.709 --> 53:14.501
I don't know them.

53:14.709 --> 53:18.334
I understand that when you were
quite little, your father, King Vegeta,

53:18.542 --> 53:23.417
did a terrible disservice to
Paragus-<i>san</i> and Broly-<i>san</i>, here,

53:23.626 --> 53:29.209
and up until now, they were trapped
on an unfamiliar, inimical world.

53:35.376 --> 53:36.876
Frieza!

53:39.167 --> 53:40.959
What's "inimical"?

53:44.001 --> 53:46.667
It means "beyond severe."

53:47.501 --> 53:48.501
Thanks.

53:48.667 --> 53:50.126
You idiot!

53:51.334 --> 53:55.501
I swear that you, at least,
will pay for that, Vegeta!

53:56.667 --> 53:59.417
We are here to take revenge!

54:00.917 --> 54:03.626
Don't be ridiculous!
How is that any of my affair?

54:03.834 --> 54:05.626
He ain't got nothing to do with that!

54:05.834 --> 54:07.542
We're all Saiyans here.

54:07.751 --> 54:09.459
Let's just get along.

54:13.751 --> 54:15.417
Frieza-<i>sama?</i>

54:19.334 --> 54:22.751
He appears unable to wait. Very well.

54:22.959 --> 54:26.376
Please show me what he has.

54:26.834 --> 54:28.751
Understood, sir.

54:28.959 --> 54:30.834
All right! Broly!

54:31.042 --> 54:32.334
Do it!

54:53.667 --> 54:57.417
You're not bad, huh?
I'm finally starting to warm up!

55:11.501 --> 55:12.542
He's fast!

55:13.501 --> 55:16.542
He must have studied how to use his power.

55:21.751 --> 55:25.042
It looks like Vegeta is
fairly well-trained, too.

55:25.251 --> 55:29.542
They have been through their
own share of battles, after all.

55:29.751 --> 55:33.167
Moreover, your son seems
yet unaccustomed to this.

55:33.376 --> 55:36.917
Broly-san has never fought
another person, correct?

55:37.126 --> 55:39.209
Only simulated fights with me.

55:39.417 --> 55:44.167
Fighting against someone of your
battle power is all but meaningless.

55:45.126 --> 55:46.876
Not to worry.

55:47.084 --> 55:49.334
He is steadily becoming
more familiar with it.

56:02.251 --> 56:03.751
Good, Broly!

56:14.376 --> 56:16.584
You're a real pest!

56:26.084 --> 56:27.292
Hmph.

56:45.792 --> 56:48.459
Wh-What is that?!

56:48.667 --> 56:53.792
Oh, is Broly-<i>san</i> not able
to turn Super Saiyan?

56:54.001 --> 56:58.251
S-Super Saiyan? You don't mean...

56:58.459 --> 56:59.834
...like the legend?

57:31.917 --> 57:34.126
What's with this guy?

57:40.292 --> 57:42.376
He's quick to develop!

58:02.001 --> 58:06.459
He's awesome! He's starting to
hold his own in his base form!

58:59.126 --> 59:03.042
I-I never imagined that Vegeta
had improved so much.

59:03.251 --> 59:05.792
Oh, has he reached his limit already?

59:06.001 --> 59:08.584
Y-Yes, sir.

59:08.792 --> 59:10.709
Oh, very well.

59:10.917 --> 59:13.751
Perhaps we should call it a day.

59:13.959 --> 59:15.167
Yes, sir.

59:21.334 --> 59:22.709
What is this?

59:25.251 --> 59:29.792
N-No! Broly! That's enough for now!

59:30.001 --> 59:33.126
Stop! Come back!

59:41.417 --> 59:43.334
I-It's gone!

59:43.542 --> 59:46.959
My remote control is gone! Oh, no!

59:47.167 --> 59:51.876
Broly!! I told you to stop!

59:55.292 --> 59:59.792
Didn't you hear what I said?!

01:00:02.501 --> 01:00:04.084
This is ridiculous.

01:00:04.792 --> 01:00:07.959
S-Stop, Vegeta!!

01:01:03.792 --> 01:01:05.251
No way...

01:01:05.459 --> 01:01:06.262
Wha--?

01:01:06.292 --> 01:01:08.251
Have you ever seen
a Saiyan like this before?

01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:11.626
Hey, did you bring any
senzu beans, Kakarot?!

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:14.209
No, I didn't!

01:01:14.417 --> 01:01:17.001
This is no time to be playing around.

01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:45.917
Eep! If that had hit the ground...!

01:01:55.501 --> 01:01:56.792
Vegeta!

01:02:03.292 --> 01:02:04.751
What is that?

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:06.792
Th-That...?

01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:10.042
He seems to have become able to
transform and take on the power

01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:12.959
that Saiyans have when
becoming Great Apes,

01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:17.167
without a Great Ape's lumbering moves,
by remaining in his humanoid form.

01:02:18.626 --> 01:02:20.251
Is there some issue with it?

01:02:20.459 --> 01:02:22.751
Th-The thing is...

01:02:24.959 --> 01:02:29.501
He cannot even control it himself.

01:02:41.667 --> 01:02:43.126
Hey, you!

01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:50.001
I think it's about time you fought me.

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:47.917
Hey, calm down!

01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:09.042
We all live in peace here on the earth!

01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:19.626
Well, a lot... has happened, but still...

01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:27.084
Whatever the case, you ain't a bad guy.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:29.167
I can tell.

01:06:30.959 --> 01:06:35.792
Stop doing this. You don't have to listen
to what those bad guys say.

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:19.167
Frieza-<i>sama</i>, is it okay
if we back off a little?!

01:07:19.376 --> 01:07:21.959
That would seem to be for the best.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:30.251
We will take charge of the Dragon Balls!

01:07:32.042 --> 01:07:38.209
We are now free to watch your
son's exploits without reservation.

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:07.626
That guy is that phenomenal?

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.584
Still, this...

01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:11.417
...isn't right.

01:08:11.626 --> 01:08:12.709
Yeah.

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:20.084
It's because of his old man.

01:08:20.292 --> 01:08:21.459
Yeah.

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:26.542
This is the result of him
taking that sweet Broly

01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:30.584
and raising him to be the kind of warrior
that he wants him to be.

01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:33.417
And now he's snapped.

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:37.876
I really feel sorry for the guy.

01:08:42.126 --> 01:08:44.459
Oh, if this keeps up...

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:48.542
...my Broly... will be killed...!

01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:52.292
Oh... it's all over...!

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:13.959
Well, well, it appears the great
Frieza-<i>sama</i> may not get a chance.

01:10:23.126 --> 01:10:24.126
Son!

01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:27.917
What's happened?

01:10:28.126 --> 01:10:30.876
That isn't just Frieza's <i>Ki.</i>

01:10:31.084 --> 01:10:34.084
Yeah, you're right...

01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:36.626
Sounds like you have your hands full.

01:10:39.042 --> 01:10:41.167
You got that right.

01:10:41.376 --> 01:10:43.417
It's a tremendous <i>Ki.</i>

01:10:43.626 --> 01:10:47.417
Even if I went there,
I'd just be in the way.

01:10:47.626 --> 01:10:51.001
Just stand by there for me.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:58.751
I-If things get out of hand, I'll use
Instantaneous Movement to head there.

01:11:06.584 --> 01:11:11.167
If you're saying something like that,
this must be some foe, all right.

01:11:13.834 --> 01:11:15.292
Later.

01:13:09.126 --> 01:13:14.334
P-Perhaps... what King Vegeta said...

01:13:14.542 --> 01:13:16.751
...was true...

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:34.459
Are you sure that he really has
nothing more this time?

01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:36.084
Y-Yes, sir...

01:13:36.292 --> 01:13:38.584
I see.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.417
Shall we put that to the test?

01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:53.917
Ahem.

01:13:54.126 --> 01:13:57.626
Broly-<i>san!</i> Look at this!

01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:00.001
Broly-<i>san!</i>

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:04.751
Your father has been killed!

01:14:57.042 --> 01:15:00.459
Yes! I succeeded!

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:48.501
Very nice.

01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:51.626
That was the expression I was waiting for.

01:15:53.417 --> 01:15:55.334
What are you dawdling around for?!

01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:56.584
Idiot!

01:16:00.042 --> 01:16:02.501
This is no time to insist on fighting
one-on-one, right?

01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:05.751
I hate to admit it,
but it looks like you're right.

01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:22.001
Let's go, Vegeta!

01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:25.376
Damn it all!

01:16:25.584 --> 01:16:26.917
Gyallic Ho!

01:16:27.126 --> 01:16:28.542
Kamehame...

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.751
Hal!

01:16:42.334 --> 01:16:46.459
J-Just a moment! I am Frieza!

01:16:51.376 --> 01:16:53.334
Vegeta! Now! Over here!

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:55.001
Wh-What?!

01:16:58.584 --> 01:17:01.667
Hey, what in the world is going on?!

01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:05.001
Let go of me!

01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:07.417
Hurry! I'll explain later.

01:17:07.626 --> 01:17:09.667
Piccolo. Got any senzu?

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:11.667
No, I don't.

01:17:14.792 --> 01:17:16.376
Hey, Vegeta,

01:17:16.584 --> 01:17:18.501
do you know the technique called Fusion?

01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:23.917
Fusion? Yeah, now that you mention it,
Trunks said something about it.

01:17:24.126 --> 01:17:27.376
Hmm? That technique where you do
absurd moves and merge together?!

01:17:27.584 --> 01:17:30.417
Yeah, we're gonna do "Fu-sion"!

01:17:30.626 --> 01:17:31.876
Don't be ridiculous!

01:17:32.084 --> 01:17:34.792
As if I'd ever merge myself... with you!

01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:37.209
It's just for 30 minutes!

01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:40.251
We've joined together before with
the potara earrings, didn't we?

01:17:40.459 --> 01:17:45.042
We ain't got potaras here,
so Fusion is the only way to beat him!

01:17:45.251 --> 01:17:47.834
Even if we have no choice
but to merge together...

01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:51.542
...are you telling me to do these,
these, and these moves?!

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:56.209
It's the only way to win!
The earth could be done for!

01:17:56.417 --> 01:17:59.126
Hmph, then that's just fate.

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:04.251
You're okay with letting
your beloved Bulma die?

01:18:05.542 --> 01:18:09.751
Don't try to embarrass me into it! Tch!

01:18:09.959 --> 01:18:13.334
A-All right. Hurry up and teach it to me!

01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:33.042
You dare to push me...

01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:36.126
...to these lengths, do you?

01:18:36.334 --> 01:18:43.334
Then I will teach you a lesson
in the force of Golden Frieza!

01:18:43.542 --> 01:18:46.209
Fu... sion!

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:47.792
Ha!!

01:18:48.001 --> 01:18:50.709
What an embarrassing pose...!

01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:55.834
This is Fusion. We ain't got any time.
Come on, let's practice!

01:18:56.042 --> 01:18:58.209
What's wrong, Vegeta?

01:18:58.417 --> 01:19:01.209
I'd rather be dead...

01:19:03.042 --> 01:19:05.584
Fu... sion!

01:19:05.792 --> 01:19:06.959
Ha!!

01:19:21.209 --> 01:19:24.376
Heh-heh, nobody's stronger than me now!

01:19:24.584 --> 01:19:26.542
No good! Your fingers didn't match up!

01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:29.501
Try it again in 30 minutes!

01:19:37.626 --> 01:19:39.292
Fu...

01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:40.501
...sion!

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:41.876
Ha!!

01:19:46.876 --> 01:19:48.542
Absolutely wrong!

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:50.834
Your two angles were slightly off!

01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:53.084
Another 30 minutes!

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:59.334
Fu...

01:19:59.542 --> 01:20:00.584
...sion!

01:20:00.792 --> 01:20:02.001
Ha!!

01:20:21.209 --> 01:20:25.792
Good! Now, get out there
and defeat him... uh...

01:20:26.001 --> 01:20:27.709
...wh-what do I call you?

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:28.726
Huh?

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:31.751
Using potaras, it was "Vegetto," wasn't it?

01:20:31.959 --> 01:20:33.376
Okay then, um...

01:20:33.584 --> 01:20:35.542
Forget it! Hurry and go!

01:20:35.751 --> 01:20:40.126
I can't do that. Having a name
would sound cooler, to be sure.

01:20:40.334 --> 01:20:44.459
This time it'll be... um...

01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:46.334
...Gogeta!

01:20:57.084 --> 01:20:58.292
Wonderful!

01:20:58.501 --> 01:21:01.459
What wonderful battle power!

01:21:03.001 --> 01:21:05.417
Wh-Who are you?

01:21:05.626 --> 01:21:08.376
Hmph, I am Gogeta!

01:21:08.584 --> 01:21:11.626
Goku and Vegeta have merged together!

01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:12.917
Merged?

01:21:13.126 --> 01:21:16.959
You've been dead for a long time,
so you wouldn't know.

01:21:17.167 --> 01:21:19.626
Their two strengths are not
just added together;

01:21:19.834 --> 01:21:22.167
they're significantly greater.

01:21:22.376 --> 01:21:24.834
Th-That is not fair!

01:21:25.042 --> 01:21:28.501
You're a fine one to be saying that.

01:21:31.459 --> 01:21:32.417
Hoi!

01:21:33.751 --> 01:21:35.584
Over here!

01:21:38.334 --> 01:21:39.334
Oh, my.

01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:42.292
Whis-<i>san</i>, let me take it from here!

01:21:43.292 --> 01:21:46.751
You two can merge together, I see.

01:21:46.959 --> 01:21:49.751
Ah, it's that Fusion thing!

01:21:54.126 --> 01:21:55.326
Come on!

01:22:19.584 --> 01:22:22.584
Heh-heh-heh, now it's my turn!

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:35.042
Ha!!

01:24:37.126 --> 01:24:40.459
Broly is going to be finished at this rate!

01:24:40.667 --> 01:24:45.209
He's been turned into nothing but
a fighting machine, thanks to his father.

01:24:45.417 --> 01:24:48.209
He isn't fighting because
he wants to fight!

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:52.584
Broly is actually a
pure, kindhearted Saiyan!

01:24:52.792 --> 01:24:54.959
We can't let him die!

01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:13.959
I shall grant thee any one wish.

01:26:14.167 --> 01:26:16.334
So, now what do we do?

01:26:16.542 --> 01:26:19.376
Hurry up and tell me!

01:26:19.584 --> 01:26:20.876
Forget it, I'm shooting.

01:26:21.084 --> 01:26:24.042
A-All right! I'll tell you!

01:26:25.792 --> 01:26:28.251
"Just say the wish as-is."

01:26:28.459 --> 01:26:31.959
Oh, is that all?

01:26:34.001 --> 01:26:35.959
My wish is...

01:28:07.959 --> 01:28:10.209
Magnificent!

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:14.751
This might bring this to a close.

01:28:19.334 --> 01:28:21.334
Ka...

01:28:21.542 --> 01:28:23.709
...me...

01:28:23.917 --> 01:28:25.959
...ha...

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:29.167
...me...

01:28:31.042 --> 01:28:35.292
Ha!!

01:28:42.667 --> 01:28:43.876
Send Broly...

01:28:44.084 --> 01:28:48.417
...back to the planet where he was before!!

01:29:09.834 --> 01:29:12.709
Your wish has been granted.

01:29:14.126 --> 01:29:16.001
Farewell!

01:29:33.126 --> 01:29:34.876
Get in, Cheelai!

01:29:47.959 --> 01:29:49.376
Whoa, there!

01:30:01.626 --> 01:30:03.792
I will be back, understand?

01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:19.042
Hmph, it looks like it
turned out all right.

01:30:25.126 --> 01:30:28.459
Sorry to get you mixed up in all that.

01:30:28.667 --> 01:30:32.542
Don't worry about it. That was the most
thrilling and enjoyable time I've had

01:30:32.751 --> 01:30:35.042
since I joined the Frieza force.

01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:39.001
Think they'll come after us?

01:30:39.209 --> 01:30:40.917
Who knows?

01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:44.834
So, Cheelai,
where are you planning on going?

01:30:45.042 --> 01:30:46.626
To Broly's world.

01:30:46.834 --> 01:30:48.209
Vampa, huh?

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:51.292
What world should I let you off on, Lemo?

01:30:51.501 --> 01:30:56.917
Nah, I'll tag along with you.
The risk is the same no matter where I go.

01:30:57.126 --> 01:31:01.542
Being near the mighty Broly
will put me at ease.

01:31:05.792 --> 01:31:09.626
In that case, we'll have to stop along
the way to buy some food and stuff.

01:31:09.626 --> 01:31:11.026
"Three days later"

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:14.939
Sure enough, it appears that
those two are together with Broly.

01:31:15.126 --> 01:31:18.209
Let us leave them alone for a while.

01:31:18.417 --> 01:31:21.876
We will allow them to bring
Broly's mind under control,

01:31:22.084 --> 01:31:25.001
and once he can release
that immense power

01:31:25.209 --> 01:31:26.834
without losing his sense of self,

01:31:27.042 --> 01:31:30.626
that is when he will become
the mightiest combatant.

01:31:30.834 --> 01:31:33.959
Do you think that will work?

01:31:34.167 --> 01:31:37.251
I certainly hope that it does.

01:31:38.417 --> 01:31:42.584
No matter how hard I try
to raise my battle power,

01:31:42.792 --> 01:31:45.959
my foes are still both Son Goku and Vegeta.

01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:52.626
I would like to have one other, as well.

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:57.876
"Planetoid Vampa"

01:32:11.501 --> 01:32:15.917
You're kidding, right?
<i>This</i> is what you've been eating?

01:32:16.126 --> 01:32:21.334
W-Well, it's bitter, but it's better
than starving to death... I guess.

01:32:24.334 --> 01:32:26.876
Bleh! C-Count me out.

01:32:27.084 --> 01:32:28.667
Don't ask for too much.

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:32.709
We won't last even 50 days
on just the food we bought.

01:32:35.042 --> 01:32:36.084
Somebody's here.

01:32:36.292 --> 01:32:37.459
Huh?

01:32:37.667 --> 01:32:39.917
Hey, can I come in?

01:32:43.542 --> 01:32:46.292
Huh? Who are you guys?

01:32:46.501 --> 01:32:49.292
Y-You! You're the Saiyan from earth!

01:32:49.876 --> 01:32:54.209
Oh, right! You're the ones from the
Frieza force who used the Dragon Balls!

01:32:54.417 --> 01:32:57.292
What are you doing here?

01:32:58.834 --> 01:33:00.667
You guys are Broly's friends?

01:33:00.876 --> 01:33:03.001
I asked you what you were doing here!

01:33:03.209 --> 01:33:05.084
Now, don't lose your temper.

01:33:05.292 --> 01:33:07.834
I ain't here to fight, okay?

01:33:08.042 --> 01:33:09.251
Then, why are you here?

01:33:09.459 --> 01:33:14.292
I heard your world was awful,
so I brought you some stuff.

01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:19.001
Who asked you to? Go away.
You can't trick us.

01:33:22.376 --> 01:33:26.251
I asked someone named Bulma,
and got this for you.

01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:29.834
Could you stand back?

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:39.876
There's food and water and a bunch
of other stuff inside the house.

01:33:43.334 --> 01:33:45.626
Also, these are called senzu beans.

01:33:45.834 --> 01:33:46.959
I'm giving you two of them.

01:33:47.167 --> 01:33:50.292
Eat one whenever you think,
"Yikes, I'm gonna die!"

01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:53.667
They don't work against illnesses,
but they completely heal injuries,

01:33:53.876 --> 01:33:56.376
and restore your strength to full, too.

01:33:56.584 --> 01:33:58.334
What are you plotting?

01:33:58.542 --> 01:34:02.542
It ain't like that. I just want
you to live healthy.

01:34:02.751 --> 01:34:03.751
--Huh?
--Huh?

01:34:03.917 --> 01:34:06.751
I was so sure of my own strength,

01:34:06.959 --> 01:34:10.792
but then the much stronger Broly showed up.

01:34:11.001 --> 01:34:13.042
And what's more, he's a Saiyan,
too, just like me.

01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:15.792
He's probably even stronger
than Beerus-<i>sama</i>.

01:34:16.001 --> 01:34:18.792
Beerus-<i>sama</i> is this god, you see.

01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:20.084
Goodness.

01:34:20.292 --> 01:34:24.459
Anyways, it would be a shame
to let someone so incredible...

01:34:24.667 --> 01:34:26.584
...up and die, right?

01:34:32.376 --> 01:34:36.292
Well, whatever.
Just take care of yourselves.

01:34:36.501 --> 01:34:37.340
Bye.

01:34:37.417 --> 01:34:39.751
Huh? There's no ship.

01:34:39.959 --> 01:34:42.084
How did you get here?

01:34:42.292 --> 01:34:46.334
I can do Instantaneous Movement.
I just searched for Broly's <i>Ki</i>.

01:34:46.542 --> 01:34:50.126
I really don't get
anything you're telling us.

01:34:50.334 --> 01:34:51.751
Is it okay if I come again?

01:34:51.959 --> 01:34:55.667
Just so you know,
you're our enemy, understand?

01:34:55.876 --> 01:34:58.042
We may be out of the Frieza force,

01:34:58.251 --> 01:35:01.251
but we're not becoming friends with you.

01:35:01.459 --> 01:35:03.834
Doesn't matter to me either way.

01:35:04.042 --> 01:35:04.947
Huh?

01:35:05.042 --> 01:35:09.001
I just want you to let me
come fight Broly once in a while.

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:10.376
--Huh?
--Huh?

01:35:10.584 --> 01:35:14.251
There's some stuff I'd
like to teach him, too.

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:18.209
You sure do seem to be pretty crazy.

01:35:18.417 --> 01:35:19.417
How come?

01:35:19.626 --> 01:35:24.459
Well, anyway, I should offer
my gratitude. Thank you.

01:35:24.667 --> 01:35:27.501
Yeah. Bye now. I'll be back again.

01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:30.417
We may not be here when you do.

01:35:30.626 --> 01:35:35.084
That's okay. As long as you ain't
too far away, I can find you.

01:35:37.292 --> 01:35:40.167
What's your name?

01:35:42.917 --> 01:35:47.292
Son Goku. Also...

01:35:47.501 --> 01:35:49.209
...Kakarot.
