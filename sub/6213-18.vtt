00:05.695 --> 00:06.696
Hello?

00:06.696 --> 00:08.431
Sorry, dude, wrong number.

00:08.431 --> 00:10.033
Sure, I'll double-check.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.768
Sabrina, are we
an Indian restaurant?

00:11.768 --> 00:13.270
No statues of Vishnu here.

00:13.270 --> 00:15.372
You must have misprogrammed
your speed dial.

00:15.372 --> 00:16.506
No problem.

00:16.706 --> 00:19.743
Hey, how do you know
my name's Roxie?

00:19.743 --> 00:21.144
Why are you
mad at me?

00:21.144 --> 00:23.480
It's not my fault
the Cranberry Club

00:23.480 --> 00:26.216
had a private party
for Pedro Martinez.

00:26.216 --> 00:27.384
No, but it is your fault

00:27.384 --> 00:29.019
that we weren't
on the guest list.

00:29.019 --> 00:31.154
It is one
of your responsibilities

00:31.154 --> 00:34.357
as the boyfriend
to anticipate my needs.

00:35.492 --> 00:38.228
I'm sensing
you need to be alone.

Harvey...

00:41.531 --> 00:42.532
What?

00:42.532 --> 00:43.867
No, never mind.

00:43.867 --> 00:44.868
Okay.

00:44.868 --> 00:46.670
No, it's not okay.

00:46.670 --> 00:47.837
It hasn't been okay
for a long time.

00:47.837 --> 00:48.572
You shouldn't let Morgan

00:48.572 --> 00:49.973
push you around
like that.

00:50.373 --> 00:51.374
It's no big deal.

00:51.374 --> 00:52.576
It's just how she is.

00:52.576 --> 00:54.511
But every time you do something
she wants

00:54.511 --> 00:55.779
she loses respect for you.

00:55.779 --> 00:57.414
You have to stand up
for yourself.

00:57.414 --> 00:58.548
Tell her what you want.

00:58.548 --> 01:00.083
Okay.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.885
What do I want?

01:01.885 --> 01:03.687
To be treated like an equal.

01:03.687 --> 01:04.688
You're right.

01:04.688 --> 01:05.989
Thanks, Sabrina.

01:05.989 --> 01:09.526
I'm here to help.

01:09.526 --> 01:11.628
I can't believe
you recognize my voice

01:11.628 --> 01:12.696
from my radio show.

01:12.696 --> 01:15.065
Are you still talking
to that wrong number?

01:15.065 --> 01:16.566
He's actually kind
of cool.

01:16.566 --> 01:17.667
Do you think I should keep
on talking

01:17.667 --> 01:19.102
or is this just
too weird?

01:19.102 --> 01:20.103
Keep talking.

01:20.103 --> 01:22.105
Who knows?
He could be Mr. Right.

01:22.105 --> 01:24.107
Good thinking.
Thanks, Sabrina.

01:24.107 --> 01:25.442
I'm here to help.

01:25.775 --> 01:27.544
Yeah, I'm still listening.

01:27.544 --> 01:29.613
So, now that you know who I am

01:29.613 --> 01:32.115
why don't you tell me
about yourself?

01:32.115 --> 01:33.650
Start with your name.

01:34.017 --> 01:36.720
My name is Alejandro.

It has a pouch.
She'll hate it.

Sabrina, I've lived

Oh... well, that explains
the cake and balloons.

02:33.309 --> 02:34.944

02:57.901 --> 02:58.935
And you're paying it?

02:58.935 --> 03:00.236
Why not contest it in court?

03:00.236 --> 03:01.538
These troopers never show up.

03:01.538 --> 03:03.506
You know, the judge
will throw out the ticket

03:20.523 --> 03:21.891
I don't get off till 9:00.

03:21.891 --> 03:23.326
How about a latte instead?

03:23.326 --> 03:24.894
To go, please.

03:25.328 --> 03:27.664
Yeah, they're on some kind
of fiscal austerity kick

03:27.664 --> 03:28.832
down at the paper.

03:28.832 --> 03:31.668

the <i>Boston Citizen</i>

03:40.176 --> 03:41.177
what it is today.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.480
You gave it guts,

Not to mention 20 years
of dedicated service.

03:45.949 --> 03:48.151
And a microwave I swiped
from my mother.

03:48.151 --> 03:50.453
See? You gave that paper
the best years of your life!

03:50.453 --> 03:52.689
I mean, not that you don't have
a lot more to give.

You got a point there, kid.

03:54.124 --> 03:56.025

04:04.467 --> 04:06.636
Come on. Give me somebody!

04:07.337 --> 04:08.505
Hey, Miles.

04:08.505 --> 04:10.573
So, how did it go
at court this morning?

04:10.573 --> 04:11.775
Well, for starters

04:11.775 --> 04:14.811
State Trooper Norwood showed up
to testify, as is his habit

04:14.811 --> 04:16.179
so Pee-Wee's out a C-note.

04:16.179 --> 04:18.882
Then, on the way home,
I get pulled over by, guess who?

04:18.882 --> 04:21.351
"Pee-Wee, you're driving
with a broken taillight."

04:21.351 --> 04:22.786
Another 50 bucks.

04:22.786 --> 04:24.687
Thanks a lot, Sabrina.

04:24.687 --> 04:26.589
Hey, I was only trying to help.

04:26.589 --> 04:28.992
Look what Hilda made me
for my birthday.

04:28.992 --> 04:30.126
Don't you love it?

04:30.126 --> 04:31.995
I hate it.

04:31.995 --> 04:33.763
Hilda ruined
a priceless tea set

04:33.763 --> 04:35.498
that I was planning
to restore.

04:35.498 --> 04:38.067
Where did she get
such a numskull idea?

04:38.067 --> 04:40.670
I would have been happy
with a sweater.

04:40.670 --> 04:43.406
But it had a pouch!

04:46.509 --> 04:48.211
Oh, Jerry, I got something
for you.

04:48.211 --> 04:50.313
Photos of that weird cloud
from last night.

04:50.313 --> 04:52.482
Oh, uh, don't mind
the last few shots.

04:52.482 --> 04:55.552
We were just messing
around with the camera.

04:56.085 --> 04:58.288
Yeah, you're welcome!

04:58.288 --> 05:01.357
How did that punk
get to be photo editor?

05:01.357 --> 05:04.194
Huh, I'll have to ask
his uncle, Mike.

05:04.194 --> 05:06.663
MIKE:
When I say I want 2,500 words
on the new subway

05:06.663 --> 05:07.964
that's what I expect!

05:07.964 --> 05:13.036
Not 2,499. Not 2,501.
You got that, Franklin?

05:13.036 --> 05:16.172
Yeah, but I just fix
the copy machine.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.842
Now that's the Mike
we all know and love.

05:18.842 --> 05:19.843
So, let's hear it.

05:19.843 --> 05:21.511
Did corporate cave in
to your demands?

05:21.511 --> 05:23.646
Well, if my demands
included a pay cut

05:23.646 --> 05:25.548
and taking away
my health benefits

05:25.548 --> 05:26.816
then, yes, they caved.

05:26.816 --> 05:28.117
Thanks for the advice.

Hey, Harvey,
waiting for Morgan?

05:35.825 --> 05:37.827
No, actually,
I'm waiting for you.

05:37.827 --> 05:38.828
Let me guess.

05:38.828 --> 05:40.763
Even though I was
just trying to help

05:40.763 --> 05:42.232
my advice blew up
in your face

05:42.232 --> 05:43.900
and Morgan read you
the riot act.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.869
I wish that was all she did.

05:45.869 --> 05:46.903
She dumped me.

05:46.903 --> 05:49.072
I am so sorry.

05:49.072 --> 05:51.007
You know, usually,
I am really good

05:51.007 --> 05:52.008
at giving advice

05:52.008 --> 05:54.244
but these days,
I'm a menace to society.

05:54.244 --> 05:56.279
I mean, first Miles,
then Aunt Hilda

05:56.279 --> 05:57.614
then Mike, now you.

05:57.614 --> 06:01.084
Sabrina, every language
has a word for people like you.

06:01.084 --> 06:02.285
In Swahili, it's...

( <i>clicking tongue</i> )

06:04.687 --> 06:06.322
( <i>sighs</i> ):
I know.

06:06.322 --> 06:08.658
In English,
it's "busybody."

06:08.658 --> 06:11.294
That would be
the cleaned-up version.

06:11.728 --> 06:13.396
The Other Realm

06:13.396 --> 06:15.064
It's been
a lifesaver for me.

06:15.064 --> 06:17.367
And the front section
on theater seating

06:17.367 --> 06:18.701
really comes in handy.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.703
Wait. So these
are real businesses?

06:20.703 --> 06:23.106
"Painting lessons
from Vincent van Gogh"?

Whoa. "Martial Arts lesson
with Genghis Khan."

06:27.677 --> 06:30.179

Harvey, no!

06:30.647 --> 06:32.148

06:32.382 --> 06:33.650
No way.

Mr. Khan, it's an honor
to meet you.

06:35.885 --> 06:37.186

What did he say?

06:39.455 --> 06:41.391
He's going to eat you.

06:44.661 --> 06:47.163
There's got to be a cure
for a busybody in here.

06:47.163 --> 06:48.164

Bingo!

Thanks a lot, Sabrina.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.145

to me.

07:02.145 --> 07:03.346
( <i>yelling</i> )

07:05.682 --> 07:08.685
Still, I got to spend
some quality time

07:08.685 --> 07:10.954
with Genghis Khan. Cool.

07:14.490 --> 07:17.093
Never sneak up on a guy
with a blue flame.

07:17.093 --> 07:18.161
Sorry, buddy.

07:18.161 --> 07:19.462
I'm looking for Buddy.

07:19.462 --> 07:21.331
You found him.

07:21.331 --> 07:22.799
What can I do you for,
sugarplum?

07:22.799 --> 07:24.500
Well, I'm an
out-of-control busybody.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.702
Can you fix me?

07:25.702 --> 07:26.769
I can fix anything.

07:26.769 --> 07:28.671
But busybodies,
my bread and butter.

07:28.671 --> 07:31.074
I'll probably just have
to tweak your gyro.

07:31.074 --> 07:33.543
Whoa, whoa! Keep your
grubby hands off my gyro.

07:33.543 --> 07:34.744
What's a gyro anyway?

07:34.744 --> 07:36.813
It's the business end
of your busybody part.

07:36.813 --> 07:38.648
Oh, well, I want nothing
to do with it.

07:38.648 --> 07:39.983
Get rid of the whole thing.

07:39.983 --> 07:41.250
Why would you want to do that?

07:41.250 --> 07:43.353
Because every time I get
involved in someone's life

07:43.353 --> 07:44.520
I cause nothing
but trouble.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.955
Say no more.

07:45.955 --> 07:48.992
I can put you up
on the rack right now.

07:50.326 --> 07:51.661
Hey, nice rack.

07:51.661 --> 07:53.730
Yeah. I get that a lot.

07:53.730 --> 07:56.933
All right,
you're all set,
Mr. Johnson.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.668
What was he here for?

07:58.668 --> 07:59.802
Can't tell you.

07:59.802 --> 08:02.271
Mechanic-patient

08:02.271 --> 08:04.374
But I can tell you this.

08:04.374 --> 08:09.345
He's now sleeker, faster,
and he handles like a dream.

08:10.913 --> 08:13.249
Your favorite music
is Swiss jazz?

08:13.249 --> 08:14.684
You are such a kook.

08:14.684 --> 08:16.085
Okay, call me later.

08:16.085 --> 08:17.186
Bye, Alejandro.

08:17.186 --> 08:18.554
So, Alejandro, huh?

08:18.554 --> 08:20.690
When did you start
seeing him?

08:20.690 --> 08:21.657
I haven't yet.

08:21.657 --> 08:23.326
So far we've only talked
on the phone.

08:23.326 --> 08:24.427
It's the craziest story.

08:24.427 --> 08:25.695
We met over a wrong number.

08:25.695 --> 08:27.697
I'll give you a crazy story.

08:27.697 --> 08:31.334
I'm in Ireland,
hunting leprechauns...

08:31.334 --> 08:34.070
Tell me about Alejandro.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.705
Well, he's confident
and smart.

08:35.705 --> 08:37.507
He lives
with two female roommates

08:37.507 --> 08:38.775
so he understands women.

08:38.775 --> 08:41.110
He likes foreign music,
<i>loves</i> Indian food.

08:41.110 --> 08:42.945
Who knows? Maybe this could be
the real thing.

08:42.945 --> 08:44.847
Just make sure it's not
the diet real thing.

08:44.847 --> 08:45.948
Too much aspartame.

08:45.948 --> 08:47.850
Sabrina thinks I should meet him
for coffee.

08:47.850 --> 08:48.985
What do you think?

08:48.985 --> 08:50.386
I think I've got a piece
of tea cup

08:50.386 --> 08:51.854
stuck in my bra.

08:52.388 --> 08:54.323
( <i>whirring</i> )

08:56.092 --> 08:58.461
Funny. You know,
I don't feel any different

08:58.461 --> 08:59.896
without my busybody part.

08:59.896 --> 09:01.697
Well, maybe a little greasier.

09:01.697 --> 09:03.433
Well, there's your old part.
You want it?

09:03.433 --> 09:06.035
I didn't keep my tonsils,
and I'm not keeping that.

09:06.035 --> 09:07.170
So, am I good to go?

09:07.170 --> 09:08.171
Not quite.

09:08.171 --> 09:09.839
Let's test you
out first.

09:09.839 --> 09:11.107
Sabrina...

09:11.107 --> 09:13.042
the girl I've been dating
for about five years

09:13.042 --> 09:14.610
she's pressuring me
to get married...

09:14.610 --> 09:16.512
Buddy, you know,
this is none of my business.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.382
Whoa! I have never
said that before.

09:19.382 --> 09:22.452
You do excellent work.

09:22.452 --> 09:27.990
If only you were here, my love,
to nibble on my garlic naan.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.158
Where's Zelda?

09:29.158 --> 09:30.660
I fixed her stupid teapot.

09:30.660 --> 09:31.727
Do you mind?

09:31.727 --> 09:34.931
I'm talking on the phone
to my lady.

09:34.931 --> 09:37.567
This is the real thing.

09:38.101 --> 09:40.002
Oh, that's my roommate.

09:40.002 --> 09:43.206
She has father issues
and needs to be loved by all men

09:43.206 --> 09:44.574
great and small.

09:44.574 --> 09:46.075
Hmm, the real thing.

09:46.075 --> 09:48.344
Likes Indian food.

09:48.344 --> 09:50.613
Knows my feminine inner shame.

09:50.613 --> 09:52.248
And by any chance

09:52.248 --> 09:53.816
would that grating excuse
for music

09:53.816 --> 09:55.651
be Swiss jazz?

09:55.651 --> 09:58.588
Yeah, what of it,
you Lucerne-aphobe?

09:58.588 --> 09:59.956
The jig's up, Salem.

09:59.956 --> 10:02.091
There will be no interspecies
dating under my roof.

10:02.091 --> 10:03.326
Eww.

10:03.326 --> 10:04.927
( <i>sighs</i> ):
I'll call you later, Roxie.

10:04.927 --> 10:05.928
Ciao.

10:05.928 --> 10:07.063
You idiot.

10:07.063 --> 10:08.598
What do you think
Roxie's going to do

10:08.598 --> 10:10.266
when she finds out
Mr. Right has a tail?

10:10.266 --> 10:12.335
What any normal person would do.

10:12.335 --> 10:15.037
Make a lifestyle adjustment.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.075
We've got a big problem.

10:19.075 --> 10:21.244
Roxie is having a phone fling
with Salem.

10:21.244 --> 10:22.612
What your cat
and my best friend

10:22.612 --> 10:23.613
do in their spare time

10:23.613 --> 10:25.748
is absolutely none
of my business.

10:25.748 --> 10:26.282
Sabrina?

10:26.282 --> 10:28.584
Harvey, I know it's none
of my business

10:28.584 --> 10:30.052
but do you need a refill?

10:30.052 --> 10:31.721
I need your help.

10:31.721 --> 10:33.022
Look over there.

10:33.322 --> 10:34.824
( <i>laughing</i> )

10:34.824 --> 10:38.427
That guy with Morgan
is Johnny Austin.

10:38.427 --> 10:39.328
He's ranked number two

10:39.328 --> 10:41.330
in Boston's underground
kickboxing league.

10:41.330 --> 10:44.400
So?
So his wife
is Penelope Austin

10:44.400 --> 10:46.169
the number one kickboxer.

10:46.169 --> 10:48.671
Word on the street
is she's the jealous type.

10:49.272 --> 10:50.373
I'm worried about Morgan

10:50.373 --> 10:52.074
even though I hate her
right now.

10:52.074 --> 10:54.944
Well, I was just about
to go over there anyway.

10:55.311 --> 10:57.146
Morgan,
I think there's something

10:57.146 --> 10:58.881
you should know
about this guy.

10:58.881 --> 11:02.752
He's... out of coffee.

11:02.752 --> 11:05.154
Thanks, hon.

11:06.789 --> 11:07.790
How did it go?

11:07.790 --> 11:08.925
Great.

11:08.925 --> 11:09.825
Just at the moment
when I thought

11:09.825 --> 11:10.760
I was about to jump in
and save the day

11:10.760 --> 11:12.995
I did nothing!

11:12.995 --> 11:14.497
Whoo!

11:15.665 --> 11:16.666
Get out
while you can.

11:16.666 --> 11:18.401
Mike's on a tear.

11:18.401 --> 11:19.402
MIKE:
Josh!

11:19.535 --> 11:21.404
Too late.
For you.

11:21.404 --> 11:22.605
Everyone's calling the paper

11:22.605 --> 11:24.073
about that weird cloud
last night.

11:24.073 --> 11:25.608
Where are the photos you took
of it?

11:25.608 --> 11:26.709
Oh, I gave them
to Jerry.

11:26.709 --> 11:27.610
No, you didn't.

11:27.610 --> 11:28.611
I absolutely did.

11:28.611 --> 11:30.613
Jerry,
we were right over there.

11:30.613 --> 11:31.614
Sabrina was with me.

11:31.614 --> 11:32.949
You saw me hand Jerry
the disk.

11:32.949 --> 11:33.950
Tell them.

11:33.950 --> 11:35.418
This is absolutely
none of my business.

11:35.418 --> 11:36.719
What?
Josh

11:36.719 --> 11:38.955
I give only one warning,
and this is yours.

11:38.955 --> 11:40.890
Next time you screw up
and lie about it

11:40.890 --> 11:42.191
you're fired.
You got that?

11:42.191 --> 11:43.226
Yes, sir.

11:43.226 --> 11:44.727
I told you
he was a punk.

11:44.727 --> 11:45.728
Shut up, Jerry.

11:45.728 --> 11:48.097
Thanks a lot, Sabrina.

11:48.097 --> 11:49.298
No problem.

11:49.298 --> 11:51.767
I am <i>not</i> here to help.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.075
Sabrina, what is wrong with you?

11:59.075 --> 12:00.576
You know I gave those photos
to Jerry.

12:00.576 --> 12:02.011
Why didn't you stand up
to Mike for me?

12:02.011 --> 12:03.145
It's not my nature
to get involved.

12:03.145 --> 12:05.081
It's <i>totally</i>
in your nature.

12:05.081 --> 12:07.483
It's the very fiber
of your being.

12:07.483 --> 12:09.585
Well, I am cutting
back on the fiber.

12:09.585 --> 12:11.153
I've turned over
a new leaf.

12:11.153 --> 12:12.655
I'm not longer
a busybody.

12:12.655 --> 12:15.091
Sabrina, I needed your help,
and you bailed on me.

12:15.091 --> 12:16.726
Now my job's hanging
by a thread.

12:16.726 --> 12:19.595
Well, I didn't mean to
jeopardize your job.

12:19.595 --> 12:20.529
Then why did you?

12:20.529 --> 12:21.931
I don't know.

12:21.931 --> 12:24.867
Why did I let Morgan seduce
a married kickboxer?

12:24.867 --> 12:26.969
Why am I letting
Roxie date a cat?

12:26.969 --> 12:28.371
Roxie's dating a cat?

12:28.371 --> 12:30.239
Have you completely
lost it?

12:30.239 --> 12:34.243
Yeah! And I think I
better go get it back.

12:34.644 --> 12:36.679
Well, you're all set,
Mr. McCoy.

12:36.679 --> 12:39.215
I just had to adjust
your Afraidiator.

12:39.215 --> 12:41.817
I was afraid it was going
to be <i>more</i> serious.

12:41.817 --> 12:43.319
But I'm not anymore.

12:43.319 --> 12:46.789
Thanks a lot.

12:46.789 --> 12:48.958
Hey, Buddy,
I hate to be one of
<i>those customers</i>

12:48.958 --> 12:50.826
but you have to put my
busybody part back in.

12:50.826 --> 12:52.928
Removing it gave me
a whole other set
of problems.

12:52.928 --> 12:54.096
Sorry, Sabrina.

12:54.096 --> 12:56.332
Your part's on its way
to Other Realm Japan.

12:56.332 --> 12:57.833
It's a delicacy over there.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.201
Well, what am I
going to do now?!

12:59.201 --> 13:00.436
Well, you got two choices:

13:00.436 --> 13:02.405
you could marry the chef
at Planet Sushi

13:02.405 --> 13:05.041
or you can let me give you
a brand-new busybody part.

13:05.041 --> 13:06.075
I'll go with
number two.

13:06.075 --> 13:07.243
I think you'll like it.

13:07.243 --> 13:08.577
It's a generic part

13:08.577 --> 13:11.047
but at least it
doesn't smell like
a California roll.

13:11.047 --> 13:13.949
Sold. And suddenly hungry.

13:17.386 --> 13:19.388
Okay, I got a new busybody part.

13:19.388 --> 13:22.258
Time to do a little repair work
of my own.

13:22.925 --> 13:25.928
Mike, I need to tell
you something.

13:25.928 --> 13:28.064
Josh really did
give those pictures
to Jerry today.

13:28.064 --> 13:30.132
I saw it, but I
just didn't want
to get involved.

13:30.132 --> 13:32.601
Remind me never to choke
on a pretzel when you're around.

13:32.601 --> 13:33.803
Mike, I'm back
to my old self

13:33.803 --> 13:35.805
which means not only
would I speak up for Josh

13:35.805 --> 13:37.106
but I'd do the
Heimlich on you.

13:37.106 --> 13:38.107
I'll make a note of it.

13:38.107 --> 13:39.575
Great. That's all
I wanted to say.

13:39.575 --> 13:40.910
Except <i>whoa!</i>

13:40.910 --> 13:42.473
Is that what you're
paying for your mortgage?

13:42.473 --> 13:43.212
That's outrageous!

13:43.212 --> 13:44.780
It's also none of your business.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.781
Everything's
my business.

13:45.781 --> 13:46.782
Besides,
rates are down.

13:46.782 --> 13:47.783
You should refinance

13:47.783 --> 13:48.918
because that
mortgage payment?

13:48.918 --> 13:50.052
Come on. I've
seen your house.

13:50.052 --> 13:51.087
Talk about an
urban blight.

13:51.087 --> 13:52.421
and while we're
on the subject

13:52.421 --> 13:53.789
stop wearing
those striped ties.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.324
El Not-o flattering-o.

13:55.324 --> 13:56.592
Sabrina, I didn't ask you

13:56.592 --> 13:58.227
about my mortgage
or my neckwear.

13:58.227 --> 14:00.229
You have really
crossed the line here.

14:00.229 --> 14:01.997
You're right.
I have!

14:01.997 --> 14:03.099
And somebody's
going to pay.

14:03.099 --> 14:04.266
Who?
Buddy.

14:04.266 --> 14:06.869
Let's just hope
I saved the receipt.

14:07.536 --> 14:09.739
...how it didn't occur to Hilda

14:09.739 --> 14:13.175
that the handle goes
on the outside of the teapot

14:13.175 --> 14:14.210
is beyond me.

14:14.210 --> 14:17.179
She hears the music
different than we do.

14:17.179 --> 14:19.382
Hey, Zel, favor to ask.

14:19.382 --> 14:22.118
Salem, you already did,
and the answer is no.

14:22.118 --> 14:24.487
I can't arbitrarily
turn you into a man

14:24.487 --> 14:26.055
just so you can date Roxie.

14:26.055 --> 14:28.557
The Witches Council
has rules against that.

14:28.557 --> 14:30.326
I <i>curse</i> the Witches Council!

14:30.326 --> 14:31.994
Unless they're listening

14:31.994 --> 14:34.997
in which case
I bow to their punishing wisdom.

14:34.997 --> 14:37.666
Look, so I haven't
been a perfect cat.

14:37.666 --> 14:39.001
You've been a rotten cat.

14:39.001 --> 14:40.169
Precisely.

14:40.169 --> 14:43.005
But I'm willing to change
for Roxie.

14:43.005 --> 14:44.673
I'm in love with her.

14:44.673 --> 14:46.642
Please, Zelda,
make me a man.

14:46.642 --> 14:49.145
Oh, if I had a dollar
for every time

14:49.145 --> 14:52.481
some strapping young hunk
has said that to me...

14:52.481 --> 14:54.717
Heck! If you had a dime,
we'd all be rich!

14:54.717 --> 14:55.718
( <i>goofy laugh</i> )

14:55.718 --> 14:57.453
But seriously,
Zelda

14:57.453 --> 14:59.455
Roxie has changed me.

14:59.455 --> 15:02.124
She makes me want to be
a better cat.

15:02.124 --> 15:05.795
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
But she won't have me
unless I'm a man.

15:05.795 --> 15:07.663
Oh, good Lord.

15:07.663 --> 15:09.298
Are those tears?

15:09.298 --> 15:11.667
This is the real thing.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.637
( <i>snorting</i> ):
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

15:14.637 --> 15:15.638
Well, all right.

15:15.638 --> 15:18.007
I'll request a temporary
transformation

15:18.007 --> 15:19.508
from the Witches Council

15:19.508 --> 15:21.677
so you can meet Roxie
in human form.

15:21.677 --> 15:23.012
But I'm warning you:

15:23.012 --> 15:25.981
unless she really is the one,
the spell won't last.

15:25.981 --> 15:27.283
Yee-haw!

15:27.683 --> 15:30.352
( <i>singsong</i> ):
I'm going to be a man,
I'm going to be a man...

15:30.352 --> 15:31.353
( <i>gasps</i> )

15:31.353 --> 15:32.354
Oh, my gosh.

15:32.354 --> 15:34.123
What am I going to wear?

15:34.123 --> 15:36.826
First, you better work
on the man thing.

15:36.826 --> 15:37.927
Then we'll talk.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.763
Here you go.
My work here is done.

15:40.763 --> 15:41.764
Thanks.

15:41.764 --> 15:43.899
I can only imagine
what parts you replaced.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.501
I had some
right-brain work done.

15:45.501 --> 15:46.569
Now I have two fully
developed theories

15:46.569 --> 15:47.937
on the time-space
continuum.

15:47.937 --> 15:49.071
I'm sure
they'll hold up well.

15:49.071 --> 15:50.272
Yeah.

15:50.272 --> 15:52.641
Buddy, that new busybody part
isn't cutting it.

15:52.641 --> 15:54.844
I'm worse now
than the first time I came in.

15:54.844 --> 15:56.645
Sorry. Sometimes those
off-the-shelf parts

15:56.645 --> 15:57.947
can cause a personality glitch

15:57.947 --> 15:59.548
if they're not calibrated
just right.

15:59.548 --> 16:01.016
This is more than
just a glitch.

16:01.016 --> 16:02.051
I'm totally obnoxious.

16:02.051 --> 16:03.352
Although not half
as obnoxious

16:03.352 --> 16:04.553
at that tattoo
on your arm.

16:04.553 --> 16:06.922
You really should
have that removed.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.157
It's a birthmark.

16:08.157 --> 16:09.758
Oh. See?!
I'm out of control.

16:09.758 --> 16:12.995
Stop me before I insist
you do something
with that hair.

16:12.995 --> 16:14.430
I know what's going on here.

16:14.430 --> 16:16.232
Your body's rejecting
the new part.

16:16.232 --> 16:17.967
Great. Maybe I should
just trade it in

16:17.967 --> 16:19.802
for a new set of
time-space continuums.

16:19.802 --> 16:21.337
Now, here's what
I'm going to do.

16:21.337 --> 16:22.938
I'm going to take out
the new part.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.074
I'm going to run
a complete diagnostic on you--

16:25.074 --> 16:27.243
find out exactly
what makes you tick.

16:27.243 --> 16:28.077
Draw up your specs

16:28.077 --> 16:30.646
scratch-build
a custom, original
busybody part

16:30.646 --> 16:32.081
identical to
your old one

16:32.081 --> 16:33.682
install it
and calibrate it.

16:33.682 --> 16:34.950
How long will all that take?

16:34.950 --> 16:36.519
Three minutes.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.255
Fascinating.

16:39.255 --> 16:41.257
Why? What's it say?

16:41.257 --> 16:43.292
Well, the original part
we took out

16:43.292 --> 16:44.493
was pretty unusual.

16:44.493 --> 16:47.463
In fact, it was much more
than just a busybody part.

16:47.463 --> 16:48.931
I swear, if I
grow a beard

16:48.931 --> 16:50.432
you're in so
much trouble.

16:50.432 --> 16:52.001
No, no, no,
it's not that.

16:52.001 --> 16:55.137
Your busybody part came
with a compassion upgrade.

16:55.137 --> 16:56.205
When you were trying
to get involved

16:56.205 --> 16:57.873
in everybody's business

16:57.873 --> 16:59.909
it was because you were
sincerely trying to help.

16:59.909 --> 17:00.943
Go figure.

17:01.143 --> 17:03.012
So, I wasn't really
a busybody.

17:03.012 --> 17:04.980
I was just concerned
about my friends.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.716
Right. You had a rare piece
of equipment, Sabrina

17:07.716 --> 17:10.786
which means I gave Other Realm
Japan guy a super deal.

17:10.786 --> 17:12.488
Well, Buddy,
I've seen your work

17:12.488 --> 17:13.689
and I know you're good

17:13.689 --> 17:15.858
so get started on making
that other gizmo

17:15.858 --> 17:17.293
and what can I do to help?

17:17.293 --> 17:18.460

17:18.460 --> 17:20.362
Try to hold still.

17:22.398 --> 17:24.333
I can't believe
you have a date

17:24.333 --> 17:26.969
with a mysterious
stranger named Alejandro

17:26.969 --> 17:28.137
and I'm stuck here

17:28.137 --> 17:30.239
pretending to be
excited for you.

17:30.239 --> 17:31.307
What happened
to John Karate?

17:31.307 --> 17:32.908
I thought
he had everything.

17:32.908 --> 17:35.578
He did. Including a wife
<i>and</i> a girlfriend.

17:35.578 --> 17:39.515
I do not play second fiddle
to anyone's mistress.

we're actually meeting.

You're exactly
as I pictured you.

17:57.266 --> 17:58.934

17:58.934 --> 18:02.204
Nah, who would have thought
a craving for chutney

could lead
to an inseparable bond

18:10.846 --> 18:12.014
No, you were speaking.

18:12.014 --> 18:13.682
Da-da, of course I was!

18:13.682 --> 18:16.218
Just a momentary

You're just another pig.

No, no!

Dagnabbit!

Alejandro?

18:33.836 --> 18:36.338
Where did he go?

18:36.338 --> 18:38.841
You lost him already?

18:46.115 --> 18:50.319
Oh, Sabrina,
it's a sad, sad day.

18:50.319 --> 18:53.455
Zelda turned the cat in me
into a man

18:53.455 --> 18:57.126
but the pig in me
turned the man back into a cat.

18:57.126 --> 18:59.495
On the bright side,
you're your own petting zoo.

19:00.162 --> 19:01.330
Thanks a lot, Veronique.

19:01.330 --> 19:02.965
My pleasure,

19:18.147 --> 19:19.948
All right, everybody
gather around.

19:19.948 --> 19:22.317
I have a very important
announcement to make.

19:22.317 --> 19:23.652
Come on!

19:26.989 --> 19:28.490
Those of you who know me well--

19:28.490 --> 19:30.626
and those of you
who hardly know me at all--

19:30.626 --> 19:33.195
have experienced firsthand
what a busybody I can be.

19:33.195 --> 19:34.797
ALL:
Mm-hmm.

19:34.797 --> 19:36.165
You're right.
I deserved that.

19:36.165 --> 19:38.934
But I want you all to know
that there's a very good reason

19:38.934 --> 19:40.703
why I get involved
in your lives...

19:40.703 --> 19:43.806
and offer advice that you
probably don't want to hear.

19:43.806 --> 19:45.974
Is because you're
a tool of the devil?

19:45.974 --> 19:47.910
No. It's because
I care about you.

19:47.910 --> 19:49.344
True, you know, on occasion

19:49.344 --> 19:51.647
my advice doesn't work out
so well...

19:52.514 --> 19:54.383
Okay, quite often
and not at all.

19:54.383 --> 19:56.118
Actually, you
did me a big favor.

19:56.118 --> 19:57.986
With Morgan
out of my life

19:57.986 --> 19:59.988
I can focus on more
important things.

19:59.988 --> 20:01.724
Like digging my way
out of debt.

20:01.724 --> 20:02.858
That's good.

20:02.858 --> 20:05.728
Still, I want to apologize...

20:05.728 --> 20:07.296
for any trouble
I may have caused you

20:07.296 --> 20:08.464
in the past.

20:08.464 --> 20:09.631
On the other hand

20:09.631 --> 20:11.734
if you ever need my help,
don't hesitate to ask.

20:11.734 --> 20:13.469
I can never turn down
a friend in need.

20:13.469 --> 20:14.970

I'm "built."

20:14.970 --> 20:15.971

20:15.971 --> 20:18.140

20:18.140 --> 20:20.209
Thanks for listening.

20:21.643 --> 20:23.145
Listen, uh, Josh

20:23.145 --> 20:26.582
Sabrina told me that you <i>did</i>
<i>give those photos to Jerry.</i>

20:26.582 --> 20:28.517
So I made him look
a little harder for the disk.

20:28.517 --> 20:30.185
Lo and behold, he finds them.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.053
Sorry, kiddo.

20:31.053 --> 20:32.688
It's cool, Mike.

20:32.688 --> 20:34.256
And I'm sorry
I bailed on you.

20:34.256 --> 20:37.092
I like you much better
when you get involved.

20:37.092 --> 20:39.595
Don't worry. I plan
on staying involved...

20:39.595 --> 20:43.232
because it's part of who I am,
and I just can't help it.

20:43.232 --> 20:45.834
Of course you can't.
It's in your genes.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.203
Why else would I always be
snooping through Zelda's purse

20:48.203 --> 20:49.104
or reading her diary?

20:49.104 --> 20:49.972
Hilda!

20:49.972 --> 20:51.974
It's because I care.

20:51.974 --> 20:53.108
And caring is everything.

20:53.108 --> 20:55.077
It's one of the qualities
that makes us unique.

20:55.077 --> 20:56.445
I propose a toast.
