WEBVTT

00:08.009 --> 00:11.297
Computer:
Auto-retrieval sequence
complete.

00:11.387 --> 00:13.753
Shield levels are zero.

00:13.848 --> 00:16.965
T-3. Prepare to open canopy.

00:18.227 --> 00:22.891
Biomass indicators are
holding steady at 4-0-9.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.769
The pilot still
hasn't responded.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.270
Another failure.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.147
It can't be.

00:29.238 --> 00:33.151
Phase-negative shield
deployment will eliminate the
tissue liquefaction effect.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.170
Tell that to Officer Jedman.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.666
Linfer:
Jedman mustn't have
followed instructions.

00:47.757 --> 00:51.045
If he didn't recalibrate his
phasing prior to exiting
the wormhole...

00:51.135 --> 00:53.592
Don't blame the pilot
for your mistakes.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.136
I made no mistakes.

00:56.224 --> 01:00.593
l have correctly interpreted
the equations from the
neurochip.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.642
Strapa:
Yes, but...

01:02.730 --> 01:05.267
...those equations
are incomplete.

01:05.358 --> 01:06.768
Linfer:
Nonsense.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.770
The neurochip is designed
to locate

01:08.861 --> 01:11.944
all the wormhole knowledge
in John Crichton's brain.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.864
True. However...

01:14.951 --> 01:19.285
I had Coding Section run a
cross analysis on the data
from the neurochip.

01:19.372 --> 01:25.868
They found a hidden region,
strongly encrypted.

01:25.962 --> 01:28.999
Why hasn't it been
deciphered yet?

01:29.090 --> 01:31.172
lt resists analysis.

01:31.259 --> 01:34.251
It may be meaningless, a mere
glitch in the data stream.

01:34.345 --> 01:38.054
Or it could be the one vital
element for wormhole travel.

01:38.140 --> 01:42.133
The one element we lacked is
the correct phase progression

01:42.228 --> 01:44.844
and I'm convinced we
have that now.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.349
Convinced?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.555
Yes.

01:47.650 --> 01:53.065
In fact, I wish to pilot the
next test flight myself.

01:53.155 --> 01:56.283
As your project leader, I cannot
allow you to take the risk!

01:56.367 --> 01:58.198
Oh, permission granted.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.750
Our time grows short.

02:07.837 --> 02:09.418
We have to take risks.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.210
This has to be the key.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.171
Bring me the neurochip.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.221
Strapa:
Sir?

02:21.309 --> 02:23.766
The neurochip. Now.

02:30.735 --> 02:32.020
Scorpius:
Braca.

02:32.111 --> 02:35.069
Summon Nurse Froy and
report to my quarters.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.771
Braca:
Yes, sir.

02:39.118 --> 02:42.485
Socket in place.
Ready to install the neurochip.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.741
Is this idea wise?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.615
No.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.917
But necessary.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.337
(whirring )

02:59.638 --> 03:01.344
( exhales )

03:02.475 --> 03:04.511
(inhales)

03:04.602 --> 03:05.933
John?

03:12.109 --> 03:13.610
( chuckles )

03:14.445 --> 03:17.687
( echoing ):
John?

03:17.782 --> 03:19.898
John, are you here?

03:20.493 --> 03:23.200
Oh. So you are.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.152
Well, this is different.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.410
Scorpy, I must be in Hell.

03:28.501 --> 03:32.460
Tell me, what's the last
thing you remember?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.662
lce planet. Diagnosan.

03:34.757 --> 03:38.591
He was digging around in my
brain trying to pull your
chip out of my...

03:38.677 --> 03:40.884
Aah, N... He screwed up?

03:40.971 --> 03:43.132
I kicked it on the table?
lam in Hell!

03:43.224 --> 03:49.185
No, no, no, no.
The Diagnosan was successful,
and the neurochip was removed.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.763
And John Crichton is
alive and well.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.349
Then what the hell am
I doing here?

03:56.070 --> 03:57.981
Well strictly speaking,

03:58.072 --> 04:00.484
you're not John Crichton.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.407
But for my purposes,

04:03.494 --> 04:05.359
you'll do.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.575
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:12.670 --> 04:16.413
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:16.507 --> 04:18.088
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:18.175 --> 04:20.086
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:20.177 --> 04:22.884
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.428
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.506
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.307
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:29.395 --> 04:33.855
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.273
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

04:36.360 --> 04:38.772
Not show them...
You exist...

04:38.863 --> 04:42.572
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.012
Crichton:
Scorpy, go away. Go home.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.563
I do not even want to hear it.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.187
I'm sick and tired of having
people clomping around
inside my head.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.393
This time, it's different.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.524
We're not in your head at all.
We're in mine.

05:22.615 --> 05:26.107
Your head? Well, do yourself
a favor. Kick the habit
before it starts.

05:26.202 --> 05:28.363
I'm going for some air.
Do not wait up for me.

05:28.454 --> 05:30.285
(disgusted sigh)

05:33.751 --> 05:35.707
There's nowhere to go.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.371
(sighs)

05:45.387 --> 05:47.002
I'll explain.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.839
I put a chip in
Crichton's brain,

05:49.934 --> 05:52.425
to download the wormhole
equations the Ancients
gave him.

05:52.520 --> 05:57.184
Some neural spillover
also took place,

05:57.274 --> 06:00.391
replicating elements of
Crichton's personality
in the chip.

06:00.486 --> 06:03.273
You'll have to accept it.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.319
You are not John.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.364
All right, Scorp.
Then, what am I?

06:07.451 --> 06:10.318
Bootleg? A ghost?
Holodeck Crichton?

06:10.412 --> 06:12.243
A wandering soul that
ain't got no body?

06:12.331 --> 06:17.416
A duplicate of John's psyche,
existing only within the
neurochip.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.451
And now,

06:21.173 --> 06:23.289
within my own mind.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.333
Why?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.463
I need your help.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.342
(laughs)
Man, I'm a...

06:30.432 --> 06:34.050
I'm a voice inside your head.
What do you plan on
using for leverage?

06:34.144 --> 06:36.180
Persuasion.

06:36.272 --> 06:40.140
You know so little of me.
Let's remedy that.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.691
Let's not and say we did.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.736
My earliest memory...
-Oh, God.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.402
...is pain.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.734
( baby crying )

06:57.209 --> 06:58.790
( screaming )

07:04.383 --> 07:06.339
What the hell is that?

07:06.427 --> 07:09.590
My first 12 cycles of life.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.763
That's a little too
much information.
You can keep your memories.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.262
Don't fight it.
You'll only prolong it.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.263
Now watch.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.648
(whimpering)

07:26.739 --> 07:29.572
Tauza:
You will not cry. Sit up.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.283
(grunting in pain)

07:36.915 --> 07:38.325
Sit up.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.123
(grunting)

07:42.921 --> 07:44.081
(gasps )

07:44.173 --> 07:45.709
Faster.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.463
Why can't you sit up?

07:50.554 --> 07:51.919
(raspy voice):
It's hot.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.801
It's at less than
optimum temperature.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.595
I will make it warmer.

07:57.686 --> 08:00.268
(air rushing in)

08:02.858 --> 08:05.099
Do you know why you're here?

08:05.194 --> 08:06.309
'Cause I'm weak.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.564
Why are you weak?

08:08.656 --> 08:11.443
I am partly... Sebacean.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.319
Because?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.492
Father was Sebacean.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.659
And?

08:16.747 --> 08:19.864
Forced my mother to birth me.

08:26.632 --> 08:29.169
(console beeping )

08:32.388 --> 08:34.720
Pilot, the deep space variances
are increasing.

08:34.807 --> 08:36.513
There is a wormhole around
here somewhere.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.137
Why don't we double back
and triangulate?
-Again?

08:39.228 --> 08:42.186
Yes, again. Unless you and Moya
have something you'd
rather be doing?

08:42.272 --> 08:44.308
You wanna park and
take a nap?

08:44.400 --> 08:49.110
No. Moya is actually enjoying
this opportunity for
free flight.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.189
Retracing the last vector now.
-Thank you.

08:53.283 --> 08:59.074
Uh, you know, we've been flying
around aimlessly for nearly
15 solar days, John.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.200
It's not aimless, D'Argo.
There's a wormhole out there.
I can smell it.

09:01.291 --> 09:05.660
Besides, it keeps Moya's mind
off of Talyn and the
Retrieval Squad.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.836
Well, it hasn't stopped me
thinking about them.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.788
Yeah? Well, what do you want
me to do about that?

09:09.883 --> 09:13.046
You're the one who decided we
should stay away and let
them deal with it.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.844
Which suits you perfectly so
you can indulge yourself.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.262
Fine. I'm indulging myself.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.681
Maybe I'm entitled,
once in a while.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.053
Once in a while?

09:21.145 --> 09:24.763
You wanna push this,
Mister Let's Go Find My Son?

09:24.857 --> 09:26.347
Look, it doesn't matter
what I think.

09:26.442 --> 09:31.152
The point is that Chiana
and Jool really need to
get off this ship.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.321
They're driving each other
insane, they are driving
me insane.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.069
So do me a favor.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.526
Indulge them for once.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.245
The girls.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.664
Okay.

09:44.752 --> 09:49.041
If this vector comes up empty,
we'll bag it and go for
some shore leave.

09:50.466 --> 09:51.501
(sighs)

09:51.592 --> 09:53.173
You happy?
-Very happy.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.171
Glad you're happy.

09:55.262 --> 09:59.255
Hey, look, um, sorry
iflsnapped.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.267
You could use some sleep.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.390
Yeah, you're right. Pilot.

10:06.482 --> 10:10.816
Yes, Commander. l'll wake
you the microt Moya
senses anything.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.564
You're the man.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.114
Pilot let him sleep
for 12 arns.

10:18.202 --> 10:20.193
Don't wake him up
no matter what.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.278
Agreed.

10:24.124 --> 10:28.083
The home movies are
fascinating, Scorpy, but
why show them to me?

10:28.170 --> 10:31.879
Patience, and all
will be clear.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.173
The Scarran's name was Tauza.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.672
No one else entered,
nor spoke to me.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.881
With what condition
were you born?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.306
Sebacean heat delirium.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.726
Also known as the Living Death.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.930
Who saved you from it?

10:49.024 --> 10:50.230
Scarrans.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.228
Who specifically?

10:52.319 --> 10:53.149
You.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.979
Are you Scarran or Sebacean?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.188
Scarran.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.534
Then you cannot be weak.

10:59.618 --> 11:02.109
Sebaceans are weak.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.617
You must become strong.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.287
Scorpius:
She did teach me
strength and...

11:09.378 --> 11:12.870
assisted of course by the
usual Scarran incentives,

11:12.965 --> 11:15.581
l was also taught endurance.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.801
Th... thirsty.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.755
Your liquid is here.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.387
But you must come and get it.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.762
Can't...

11:26.854 --> 11:31.063
There are Sebacean impurities
in your physiology.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.185
You must overcome them.

11:33.277 --> 11:35.939
Water... please...

11:40.617 --> 11:41.732
(slurping)

11:44.454 --> 11:46.740
You pathetic infant.

11:46.832 --> 11:51.292
Never use that word
to me again.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.205
( loud thud )

12:00.345 --> 12:02.051
(pained sigh)

12:03.891 --> 12:05.256
(sighs)

12:07.227 --> 12:10.185
A brief respite before
we continue.

12:20.699 --> 12:21.779
A Prowler?

12:21.867 --> 12:23.152
Pilot:
Yes, sending a distress signal.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.074
Pilot, Starburst away
immediately.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.368

12:26.455 --> 12:28.696
Pilot, this is definitely
bait for a trap.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.248
This is exactly the same way
that the Retrieval Squad
ambushed Talyn.

12:32.336 --> 12:36.750
Moya detects no other vessels,
nor anything that could
conceal them.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.253
Besides, the occupant of the
Prowler is a Relgarian.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.925
What's a Relgarian?

12:42.012 --> 12:44.549
A species Moya and I trust.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.096
What, as opposed to us?

12:46.183 --> 12:48.469
Transmission coming in now.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.395
Leviathan vessel, I am Linfer.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.519
(speaks alien language)

12:56.610 --> 12:59.522
Pilot, do not answer them.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.696
(speaking alien language)

13:02.783 --> 13:05.616
Pilot:
Moya and | greet you in return.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.908
May I come aboard?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.451
Pilot:
Of course.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.245
Deploying the Docking Web now.

13:22.469 --> 13:27.133
Pilot?
-I must say again, I truly don't
believe this is necessary.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.964
Well then, humor us.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.801
DRDs are in position.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.904
(DRDs beeping)

13:46.743 --> 13:48.244
D'Argo (over P.A. ):
Prowler Pilot.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.241
Move towards the hangar doors
and, uh, leave your
weapons behind.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.910
( sniffing )

14:00.257 --> 14:01.372
I did it!

14:01.466 --> 14:02.751
Did what?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.458
Solved the shielding problem.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.464
I knew it'd work.

14:06.555 --> 14:10.298
Where's John Crichton? I need
to speak to him and to Pilot.

14:10.392 --> 14:14.681
Lady, you gotta talk
to us first.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.855
You have nothing to fear from
me, and much to gain.

14:18.942 --> 14:23.436
Tell Crichton I offer him the
secret to wormhole travel.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.786
I don't like these readings.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.205
Are they at critical levels?

14:35.292 --> 14:36.577
No, but they soon will be.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.205
Then proceed as Scorpius
instructed.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.084
Crichton:
All right, Scorpy.

14:44.176 --> 14:47.384
Pick it up. Let's get this
story over with.

14:47.471 --> 14:53.717
Tauza's attempts to teach
control weren't entirely
unproductive.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.974
I discovered my hybrid body
had a unique talent.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.188
The ability to perceive energy
signatures in living organisms.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.189
Each species is different.

15:05.280 --> 15:12.322
Still another weakness in
Sebacean physiology: the skin.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.906
It's soft, permeable,
easily penetrated.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.208
I soon discovered another
trait of energy signatures.

15:20.295 --> 15:24.163
They often changed when the
subject was being less
than honest.

15:24.257 --> 15:28.341
Sebaceans are a
deficient breed.

15:28.428 --> 15:35.721
Doubtless, that's why
Peacekeepers wanted to
hybridize them with Scarrans.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.927
Tauza lied about the
Peacekeepers.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.977
I'll have to take your
word for that.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.976
Oh, she lied.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.901
Which only made me more
determined to discover the
truth about my parentage.

15:45.987 --> 15:50.196
Of course, to do that,
I had to escape.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.074
l feigned obedience.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.403
Over time, she grew careless.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.868
But I did not.

15:58.959 --> 16:04.329
And fortunately my education
included basic technology.

16:06.508 --> 16:11.798
I'd often watch Tauza operate
the controls, dragging up
data for my lessons,

16:11.888 --> 16:13.799
and I have an excellent memory.

16:13.890 --> 16:17.223
So it wasn't difficult to gain
information about my prison,

16:17.310 --> 16:20.347
which turned out to be a
Scarran dreadnought.

16:26.194 --> 16:32.030
Ijumped ship in an
evacuation pod and hid
out on a Commerce Planet.

16:32.117 --> 16:36.201
And you lived happily ever
after. Is this fairy tale
over with yet?

16:36.288 --> 16:38.153
Everything I've shown
you is true.

16:38.248 --> 16:43.288
No doubt. Scorpy the teenage
hero outwits the Scarrans,
makes it looks easy.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.164
Are you going for
pity or applause?

16:45.255 --> 16:46.586
Neither.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.257
Pilot:
Scorpius is alive?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.337
Yes.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.515
But Crais and Talyn
destroyed his Marauder.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.765
Yeah, and Scorpius was
elsewhere, laughing at 'em
the whole time.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.346
It's another grand
Scorpy fake out.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.272
I knew the bastard wasn't dead.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.519
All right!

17:07.611 --> 17:08.771
Why did he send you?

17:08.862 --> 17:09.647
Commander!

17:09.738 --> 17:11.194
I came to you on my own.

17:11.281 --> 17:14.364
Scorpius's obsession with
wormholes is making him
irrational.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.113
Scorpius is not alone
in that regard.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.160
How did you find us?

17:19.247 --> 17:23.331
I correctly theorized that the
wormhole we discovered was part
of a nexus of wormholes.

17:23.418 --> 17:26.251
I checked several of the
system's exit nodes,

17:26.338 --> 17:28.954
hoping that one of them would
have attracted you for study.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.209
So you got lucky.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.040
I would have fled regardless.

17:32.135 --> 17:35.423
I'm convinced that whether
Scorpius succeeds or fails,

17:35.513 --> 17:37.299
I would be terminated.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.217
The craft you flew through
the wormhole.

17:42.312 --> 17:45.099
Did it employ phase shielding?

17:45.190 --> 17:47.055
(sighs)

17:47.150 --> 17:48.731
Then I assume it didn't.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.319
Hence you are the lucky one.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.691
If that wormhole had been
unstable in its rantath
flux variance,

17:53.782 --> 17:57.274
as most wormholes are,
you wouldn't have
survived the journey.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.240
How did you survive?

18:01.331 --> 18:05.199
l have developed a unique
spectrum of negative
phase shielding

18:05.293 --> 18:10.083
which will allow any craft to
safely traverse any wormhole.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.253
I offer you this knowledge.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.926
At what price?

18:17.013 --> 18:18.219
Moya.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.546
(gasps )

18:20.267 --> 18:22.132
No deal.

18:22.227 --> 18:25.811
I would treat her far better
than you and the others have.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.637
You know my species?

18:28.233 --> 18:29.313
Yes.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.982
Then you know our history
with Leviathans.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.275
Crichton:
I don't...

18:32.362 --> 18:33.977
and I'm the one with the gun.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.235
Pilot:
Linfer's is a peaceful
race of explorers.

18:37.325 --> 18:43.241
They use Leviathans to journey
into deep space, areas
completely unknown.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.994
Something Moya and I have
dreamed of doing.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.120
Crichton:
Pilot?

18:48.211 --> 18:51.169
You and Moya would really
consider this?

18:51.256 --> 18:54.123
Moya and I would never
abandon you Commander.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.424
Yes, but given the choice?

19:03.935 --> 19:09.896
After I escaped, | traversed
the Uncharted Territories
for several cycles,

19:09.983 --> 19:12.224
unable to learn anything
of my parents.

19:12.319 --> 19:17.655
In desperation, I flew into
Peacekeeperspace,

19:17.741 --> 19:21.484
and surrendered to the first
Command Carrier I encountered.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.115
l'm Captain Molayne,
and you're...

19:24.205 --> 19:27.117
l have chosen the
name Scorpius.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.290
Interesting choice.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.962
I've seen the logs of
your interrogation.

19:34.049 --> 19:38.292
Quite a life you've had,
if your testimony is true.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.172
It is.

19:40.263 --> 19:44.131
But there were some questions
you refused to answer.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.181
As I told your interrogators,

19:46.269 --> 19:48.601
there were some topics I will
only discuss with a
flag officer.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.428
( laughs )

19:50.523 --> 19:53.981
Captain's is as high as
you'll get, I'm afraid.

19:54.069 --> 19:59.189
You'll deal with me,
or with more interrogators.

19:59.282 --> 20:02.866
Frankly, I'm a far
better choice.

20:05.705 --> 20:10.574
I propose an exchange
of information.

20:10.668 --> 20:14.206
I gave you only a summary of my
life aboard the dreadnought.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.289
There is much more I could tell
you about Scarran behavior.

20:17.384 --> 20:21.252
Vessel design, security
arrangements, and so forth.

20:21.346 --> 20:26.886
Oh, we could of course simply
force that information
out of you.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.599
Doubtful.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.267
And unnecessary.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.141
My price is not high.

20:32.232 --> 20:36.441
I remind you, I came to
you voluntarily.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.111
All right.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.439
What's the price?

20:42.534 --> 20:44.616
I was taught that
I'm the product

20:44.702 --> 20:50.288
of a forced birthing between
a Peacekeeper male and
a Scarran female.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.491
I believe that to be false.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.995
I want to know the truth.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.076
Why?

20:55.171 --> 20:58.629
So you can find out
who you are?

20:58.716 --> 21:01.128
To find out who I should be.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.676
Everything you tell us will
be cross-checked.

21:03.763 --> 21:07.255
If we find you've been
feeding us misinformation...

21:07.350 --> 21:09.591
I will be executed as a spy.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.931
Hold out your hands.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.730
We've correlated what
you've told us so far.

21:19.821 --> 21:22.437
The pieces fit.

21:22.532 --> 21:25.239
We know what happened.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.238
The Scarran lied to you.

21:30.248 --> 21:34.457
Scorpius:
The good Captain told me
about a Leviathan full of Sebacean pioneers,

21:34.544 --> 21:37.331
on its way to colonize a planet
in the Uncharted Territories.

21:37.422 --> 21:41.381
It was brutally attacked by
a Scarran convoy,

21:41.468 --> 21:44.301
and all the civilian
passengers slaughtered.

21:44.387 --> 21:48.630
One Transport Pod managed
to escape and make
a planetary landing.

21:48.725 --> 21:53.810
These next images are not
memory, but reconstruction,

21:53.897 --> 21:57.185
based on the log tapes that
Captain Molayne shared with me.

22:07.327 --> 22:12.071
We've reached the planet and
managed to land the Pod at
approximately mid-sun.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.122
What are you recording?

22:14.209 --> 22:16.575
A complete log...

22:16.669 --> 22:20.207
and a distress call with
locator vectors.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.380
Do you think I should
transmit it?

22:23.051 --> 22:24.086
No.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.963
The Peacekeepers don't
care about us.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.965
Why tip off the Scarrans
that we survived?

22:28.056 --> 22:30.263
You can't blame the
Peacekeepers for what happened.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.217
They did warn us we were
traveling outside their
patrolled space.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.723
They didn't warn us we might
run into a Scarran massacre!

22:35.813 --> 22:37.474
Don't you think they would
have if they had known?

22:37.565 --> 22:39.806
Even if they suspected it,
they should've provided escort.

22:39.901 --> 22:42.017
If this sector was dangerous,
then we shouldn't have
come at all!

22:42.111 --> 22:44.193
How the frell were we
supposed to...

22:50.703 --> 22:52.443
lshouldn't take it out on you.

22:54.749 --> 22:57.286
This was supposed to
be our home.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.081
Well, we're here.

23:01.172 --> 23:05.085
No tools, no supplies,
no grain seed.

23:05.176 --> 23:09.419
Just one Pulse Pistol and
whatever is in this Pod.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.923
Like real pioneers.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.518
(door opening)

23:28.241 --> 23:29.526
Rylani!

23:34.914 --> 23:36.529
( screaming )

23:36.624 --> 23:39.991
No! No!

23:40.086 --> 23:42.793
(screaming and groaning)

23:46.301 --> 23:52.422
The Pod was found, containing
one corpse, a male Sebacean,

23:52.515 --> 23:55.006
but no trace of the female.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.096
Rylani? That was her name?

23:58.396 --> 24:00.057
Yes.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.056
Rylani Jeema Dellos.

24:05.653 --> 24:11.364
Born on New Heather,
disappeared on the Motak Four
colonization flight.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.360
Age 22 cycles.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.450
(sighs)

24:18.541 --> 24:22.409
The Peacekeepers didn't bother
to salvage the Transport Pod.

24:22.503 --> 24:25.415
Captain Molayne told me
where to find it.

24:30.428 --> 24:36.219
Apparently, nobody had touched
it in at least ten cycles.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.183
Or so I thought.

24:46.611 --> 24:50.103
Tauza:
The Pod is sealed.
Do not attempt escape.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.938
(groaning)

24:58.456 --> 25:01.323
( screaming )

25:05.713 --> 25:09.547
Scorpy, why would Mama Scarran
go to all that trouble to
recapture you?

25:09.634 --> 25:13.547
Well, setting a trap in a
Transport Pod wasn't
that much trouble.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.175
I should've foreseen it.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.517
| deserved what came next.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.972
(computer beeping )

25:25.149 --> 25:26.764
(electrical zapping )

25:26.859 --> 25:28.235
(gasping)

25:28.319 --> 25:34.189
Too feeble to conquer your own
deficiencies without help.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.239
(gasping in pain)

25:37.620 --> 25:41.533
You are Scarran, or
you are nothing.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.990
We tried to make you one of us.

25:44.085 --> 25:47.828
How could you reject that
for a lesser species?

25:47.922 --> 25:51.255
Give me a full account of your
actions since your escape.

25:51.342 --> 25:55.085
Begin with all Peacekeeper
encounters.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.390
( screaming )

26:03.354 --> 26:05.515
(gasping)

26:05.606 --> 26:07.107
Tell me.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.682
(panting)

26:10.903 --> 26:13.189
( screaming )

26:14.574 --> 26:16.610
(gasping)

26:19.412 --> 26:20.822
It's time to bring him
out of it.

26:20.913 --> 26:21.743
No.

26:21.831 --> 26:22.866
(gasping)

26:22.957 --> 26:24.163
The readings are now critical.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.662
What he's trying to achieve
is even more critical.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.209
He'll survive.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.411
(grunting)

26:31.507 --> 26:32.587
(gasping)

26:32.675 --> 26:34.040
Tell me.

26:34.886 --> 26:36.968
( screaming )

26:39.223 --> 26:41.088
All right, all right,
enough all ready!

26:41.184 --> 26:43.140
Scorp! Take five!

26:43.811 --> 26:45.267
(gasping)

26:45.354 --> 26:47.390
Apologies, John. Apologies.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.939
Always easy to get lost
in one's memories.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.981
Readings are back within
tolerance.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.576
He survived.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.366
He always survives.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.240
That's true.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.322
I will stop now.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.741
For the moment.

27:08.836 --> 27:12.624
I don't care! Check all the
access logs again!

27:12.715 --> 27:14.501
For what?

27:17.386 --> 27:21.925
Sir, Linfer's Prowler
can't be found.

27:22.016 --> 27:24.302
We think... we aren't sure...

27:24.393 --> 27:27.135
but, uh, we're checking now.
-What?

27:27.230 --> 27:31.769
She may have accessed certain
restricted datafiles
before she left,

27:31.859 --> 27:34.100
which may, or may not, mean...

27:34.195 --> 27:37.278
You think she intended
to defect?

27:37.365 --> 27:39.196
As I say, we-we aren't sure.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.148
Well, find out.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.572
(growling)

27:47.917 --> 27:49.453
Get some answers.

27:49.544 --> 27:53.958
lf Strappa doesn't move fast
enough, give him some
extra incentive.

27:54.048 --> 27:54.878
Clear?

27:54.966 --> 27:57.252
Quite clear, sir.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.387
Crichton:
I hate to break it to you guys,
but Moya and Pilot are for it.

28:03.474 --> 28:06.056
Sounds more like they aren't
against it. That's not
the same thing.

28:06.143 --> 28:09.306
You're actually considering
handing Moya over to
a stranger?

28:09.397 --> 28:11.183
A stranger who works
with Scorpius.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.936
She ditched Scorpius.
-Well, claims she did.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.812
I believe that part.
-There you go.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.609
It's this "deep space explorer"
dren I don't believe.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.107
I... I think she just
wants Moya

28:19.198 --> 28:21.439
so she can put some Starbursts
in between her and Scorpius.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.024
Even if we were to agree...

28:23.119 --> 28:24.199
Which we don't.

28:24.287 --> 28:25.777
...what happens to us?

28:25.872 --> 28:28.238
With wormhole tech we can drop
you anywhere you want to go.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.288
Home, if you want.
-Oh, great.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.241
That's if you can
get it to work.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.123
We're going to test it first
and until it works,

28:35.214 --> 28:37.045
all Linfer gets is
a guest room.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.340
Oh, just what we need.
Another guest.

28:39.427 --> 28:42.339
( scoffing ):
Didn't you come on board
as a "guest"?

28:42.430 --> 28:43.795
Crichton:
That's the point.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.427
We're all guests here,
and if Moya wants to go with...

28:46.517 --> 28:51.181
Can you stop pretending this is
anything other than your idea?

28:51.272 --> 28:54.480
This exactly the attitude
that got Zhaan killed.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.354
That's low.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.153
Too bad.
-D'Argo!

29:02.241 --> 29:04.232
Leave him alone.
-Leave me alone!

29:04.327 --> 29:06.067
Crichton:
Terrific, this is what we're
arguing about?

29:06.162 --> 29:09.279
The chance to stay
cooped up together?

29:09.373 --> 29:12.240
You know, if I was Moya,
I wouldn't want us here.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.090
I brought you some food.

29:21.177 --> 29:24.010
The others are still arguing.
That's what we do best
around here.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.132
It no longer matters.
I was wrong.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.349
(gasping)

29:35.232 --> 29:37.644
What is that?

29:37.735 --> 29:40.477
The start of tissue
liquefaction.

29:40.571 --> 29:44.689
Induced by exposure to
rantath flux in the wormholes.

29:44.784 --> 29:50.780
Apparently, my spectrum of
phase shielding was only
sufficient to delay its onset.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.164
I request a favor.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.295
Crichton:
How the hell did she get loose?

30:00.383 --> 30:02.294
Pilot, get that Prowler
back here.

30:02.385 --> 30:05.127
Thank you, Pilot for
granting my request.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.507
I'm sorry we won't
travel together.

30:08.349 --> 30:09.680
Taka hai...

30:09.767 --> 30:11.098
taka ho.

30:11.185 --> 30:13.176
(alarm sounds)

30:26.867 --> 30:28.482
Pilot, you let her go?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.451
Correct.

30:31.414 --> 30:32.699
She was dying.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.030
Well, we might have helped her.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.956
The offer was made.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.034
She refused.

30:38.129 --> 30:41.121
She said the cellular breakdown
was irreversible.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.876
There was nothing we could do.

30:42.967 --> 30:47.427
So, you just let her fly away
and blow herself to bits?

30:47.513 --> 30:49.253
Correct again.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.179
That's a beautiful
decision, man.

30:51.267 --> 30:55.226
It's funny how you support
Pilot only when you both
want the same thing.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.392
That's crap, Jool.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.391
Truth is never crap.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.774
We have no other choice.

31:09.869 --> 31:14.738
Do not interfere unless
absolutely necessary.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.697
But, sir...
-Quiet.

31:25.968 --> 31:29.210
I have shared these memories
for a reason.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.341
To show you what Scarrans
are like.

31:31.432 --> 31:34.845
Preaching to the choir, Scorpy.
I got no love of Scarrans.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.186
Then help us.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.477
Scarrans far outnumber
Peacekeepers.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.601
Without superior weaponry,
we will be crushed.

31:41.692 --> 31:43.728
You want to kill them,
they want to kill you.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.982
I do not see a hell of
a lot of difference.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.359
You let me finish,

31:50.076 --> 31:52.408
I'll show you the difference.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.958
You lied about my parents.

32:05.049 --> 32:08.257
Yes. To secure your allegiance.

32:08.344 --> 32:13.213
To make you hate Sebaceans
as you should.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.929
You failed.
-You defy me?

32:18.020 --> 32:23.390
Then see how easily Sebaceans
break down and beg.

32:24.235 --> 32:28.353
See your deplorable heritage.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.939
Behold, your parents.

32:36.038 --> 32:39.826
Please. Help me!

32:40.793 --> 32:42.533
( crying )

32:43.963 --> 32:45.874
Let me go.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.338
Please!

32:49.301 --> 32:50.882
Please!

32:53.264 --> 32:54.720
No!

33:31.427 --> 33:33.418
We're nearly finished, John.

33:35.347 --> 33:41.217
You are the product of a
Scarran male and a
Sebacean female.

33:41.312 --> 33:47.148
The mating process shattered
her fragile psyche.

33:47.234 --> 33:51.147
During the gestation,
she pleaded for death.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.200
You killed her.

33:55.284 --> 33:58.321
Your birth was difficult.

33:58.412 --> 34:00.403
You killed her.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.701
(gagging )

34:05.085 --> 34:07.337
( retching )

34:07.421 --> 34:13.838
In 90 other such matings, the
Sebacean female and her
offspring perished.

34:13.928 --> 34:16.635
You were the only one we saved.

34:16.722 --> 34:17.928
Why?

34:18.015 --> 34:22.475
To find out if Sebacean
genetics could serve us.

34:22.561 --> 34:30.184
But we now realize that
Sebaceans have no value,
even as breeding stock.

34:30.277 --> 34:34.862
Instead, the Sebacean race
will be eradicated.

34:34.949 --> 34:42.287
And you will further that
objective by telling us all you
can about Peacekeepers.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.238
Can't speak.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.288
Thirsty...

34:45.376 --> 34:47.583
Ahh...

34:51.257 --> 34:52.622
(yells)

34:55.094 --> 34:57.176
(grunting)

35:23.580 --> 35:25.741
(yells)

35:30.462 --> 35:33.420
(groaning)

36:02.244 --> 36:04.280
Scorpius:
After my previous escape,

36:04.371 --> 36:07.283
the Scarrans should have
instituted some rudimentary
security

36:07.374 --> 36:11.242
on their Transport Pods.
But they hadn't.

36:11.337 --> 36:15.171
Scarran hubris.
Their primary failing.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.176
You bailed again.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.093
I sent out a locator signal
which enabled a Command Carrier

36:21.180 --> 36:24.547
to overtake and destroy the
Scarran dreadnought.

36:24.641 --> 36:29.681
The Peacekeepers were
most appreciative.

36:29.772 --> 36:32.104
First Command have responded
to my request.

36:32.191 --> 36:37.185
Given your unique status
and clear loyalties,

36:37.279 --> 36:40.487
you are hereby exempted from
all Purity Regulations.

36:40.574 --> 36:43.316
So if you haven't changed
your mind...

36:43.410 --> 36:48.279
Captain Molayne, I tender
my application for
Peacekeeper service.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.244
Excellent.

36:51.335 --> 36:54.452
Through faithful service,
I quickly advanced in rank,

36:54.546 --> 36:58.380
and created a special task
force to develop wormhole
technology.

36:58.467 --> 37:04.053
Sweet move. Join the army,
get them to pay for
your pet project.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.846
You think I want wormholes
to betray Peacekeepers

37:06.934 --> 37:09.050
and to conquer the
universe myself?

37:09.144 --> 37:10.930
I don't want power,

37:11.021 --> 37:12.977
I want revenge.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.938
I want to wipe out the Scarrans
before they wipe us out.

37:18.028 --> 37:22.738
My people, yours, your friends,
everyone you care about.

37:25.035 --> 37:32.157
I've already lost people I care
about, because of you.

37:33.836 --> 37:37.169
Where is my revenge, Scorpy?

37:37.256 --> 37:40.840
I've done what I
thought necessary.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.133
You're entitled to despise me
for it but nonetheless,

37:43.220 --> 37:47.554
you and I have a common
enemy, Scarrans.

37:47.641 --> 37:51.099
They plan to exterminate
the Sebaceans, but they
won't stop there,

37:51.186 --> 37:54.644
nor with Luxans, Delvians,
Baniks or a thousand other
lower life form.

37:54.731 --> 37:59.225
They'll stop when they're the
only sentient species left.

37:59.319 --> 38:03.062
And if they discover wormhole
technology before we do,

38:03.157 --> 38:05.864
the galaxy is theirs.

38:05.951 --> 38:11.446
And eventually, John,
they will find Earth.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.031
Your race is defenseless.

38:15.419 --> 38:20.834
They'll be raped and
slaughtered, unless you help us.

38:27.723 --> 38:31.841
These are the wormhole
calculations the Ancients
left in your mind.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.309
We can't decode them.

38:37.274 --> 38:38.684
You can.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.066
Go on, unlock it.

38:46.158 --> 38:49.650
Give us the weapon we need
to defeat the Scarrans.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.914
Scorpius...

39:01.215 --> 39:04.082
It's not mine to give away.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.093
You remember what the
Ancients told me?

39:08.180 --> 39:09.716
John...

39:09.806 --> 39:13.674
"If you're not smart enough to
discover it for yourself,

39:13.769 --> 39:17.557
you're not smart enough
to use it wisely."

39:21.401 --> 39:23.892
Froy:
His temperature's climbing.
He's in danger.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.272
(gasping)

39:25.364 --> 39:28.777
Well, thanks for the slide
show. Gotta go.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.244
No John, you cannot leave.

39:31.328 --> 39:32.989
I'll find my own way out.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.741
You must retrieve it!

39:34.831 --> 39:37.038
Scorpy, I'm off the clock.

39:37.125 --> 39:37.784
John!

39:37.876 --> 39:39.286
(panting)

39:39.378 --> 39:40.413
We have to intervene.

39:40.504 --> 39:43.211
Retrieve...

39:43.298 --> 39:44.799
Not yet. He's on to something.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.214
data!

39:48.845 --> 39:50.676
Oh, Scorpy...

39:50.764 --> 39:52.925
you're getting kind of
warm to the touch.

39:53.016 --> 39:55.268
You should take a break
and calm down.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.183
Froy:
The neural stress is
killing him.

39:57.271 --> 39:57.930
Not yet.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.103
I'm removing the chip.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.806
I said keep away from him.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.857
My duty is to Scorpius.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.110
So is mine.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.812
(yells)

40:08.907 --> 40:12.115
I will not let you leave...

40:12.202 --> 40:13.408
Do you think...

40:13.495 --> 40:16.783
that neural clones
go to heaven?

40:16.873 --> 40:18.704
Well, wherever I wind up,

40:18.792 --> 40:20.748
when I see your mama,

40:20.836 --> 40:22.827
I'll be sure to give her
your regards.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.457
( screams )

40:30.262 --> 40:32.344
( cries out )

40:32.431 --> 40:34.547
(panting)

40:41.023 --> 40:42.934
(yelling)

40:44.860 --> 40:46.441
( screaming )

41:02.294 --> 41:04.205
(groaning)

41:16.600 --> 41:18.136
John?

41:20.145 --> 41:21.510
John?

41:26.526 --> 41:29.484
If you are here to give me
another lecture, go away.

41:29.571 --> 41:34.156
Well, if you are going to be as
sour as an unmated flibisk,
I will go away.

41:34.242 --> 41:36.198
What the hell's a flibisk?

41:36.286 --> 41:39.153
A flibisk... a flibisk is a, uh

41:39.247 --> 41:41.283
ten-legged creature
about this big.

41:41.375 --> 41:43.115
Very tasty, if prepared right.

41:43.210 --> 41:48.830
But if you prevent it from
mating, it gets very
disagreeable.

41:48.924 --> 41:50.664
Hell, who doesn't?

41:57.099 --> 42:00.216
You ever think we've been on
this boat way too long?

42:00.310 --> 42:02.392
Constantly.

42:02.479 --> 42:05.687
But so far, all the other
alternatives have been worse.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.402
Well, here's to that changing.

42:15.325 --> 42:17.657
You know, Scorpy's
still out there.

42:17.744 --> 42:21.657
He's working on the wormhole
tech and he's a lot further
along than I am.

42:22.582 --> 42:25.164
He hasn't found it yet.

42:25.252 --> 42:27.584
And Linfer was wrong.

42:27.671 --> 42:30.708
But Linfer found us.

42:30.799 --> 42:33.290
And if she can, Scorpy can.

42:43.395 --> 42:46.137
Velka nine, exponent nine,

42:46.231 --> 42:49.268
devra four, three, one.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.934
Equivalence maslet nine,

42:53.029 --> 42:54.985
palanek square,

42:55.073 --> 42:56.938
equivalence integral nine.

42:57.033 --> 43:00.241
Velka hypercube brell marak.

43:00.871 --> 43:03.954
Six Ierg one.

43:08.378 --> 43:11.085
That's everything I recall.

43:11.173 --> 43:15.132
It's incomplete, but it should
be enough to put us in the
correct track.

43:15.218 --> 43:22.135
Oh, it certainly will, sir.
I can already see solutions
to several previously unknown variables.

43:24.269 --> 43:25.725
Then resume work.

43:31.651 --> 43:33.482
Sir.

43:33.570 --> 43:39.110
Cybernetics Section verifies
the neurochip circuits were
destroyed by the heat.

43:39.201 --> 43:43.285
It doesn't matter. We may now
have the data we need.

43:45.457 --> 43:47.322
Will that be all, sir?

43:48.418 --> 43:50.204
For the moment.

43:52.464 --> 43:54.921
Lieutenant,

43:55.008 --> 43:57.670
your recent performance...

has been exemplary.

44:04.893 --> 44:06.474

Thank you, sir.

44:16.863 --> 44:19.195
I hope my conduct continues
to find favor.
