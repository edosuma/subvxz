WEBVTT

00:00.533 --> 00:01.934
How you doing, sweetheart?

00:01.936 --> 00:02.835
<i>Endor is a wonderful officemate.</i>

00:02.837 --> 00:04.303
Hi, handsome.

00:04.305 --> 00:07.873
<i>They're all special,
but he's really special.</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:11.076
The cardiologist said he had
one to maybe three months to live

00:11.078 --> 00:12.511
<i>and that was ten months ago.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:13.812
He's a fighter, my boy.

00:16.383 --> 00:17.783
[man 1] <i>You can really get
people excited about insects</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:20.953
if you show how big they can
get, how colorful they can get

00:20.955 --> 00:22.755
<i>and when we get a couple
hundred of these eggs,</i>

00:22.757 --> 00:25.758
<i>we will set up
an egg hatching tank.</i>

00:25.760 --> 00:27.960
<i>It's really nice
to have a rotating colony.</i>

00:28.661 --> 00:30.596
[woman 1]
Good morning, Hoover.

00:30.598 --> 00:34.733
I would kind of describe Hoover like
an old man. He wants what he wants.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.436
<i>Like, "Get out of my house."
Like, "This is mine."</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:45.044
<i>[man 2] If you ask a child
to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:49.148
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.550
We've got to take that image
and change it.

00:51.552 --> 00:55.354
I really enjoy this. It strengthens the
bond that we have with these guys.

00:56.423 --> 00:57.556
- Come on.
- [man 3] I know you don't like doors.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.925
[woman 2] Come on, ladies.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.828
<i>[man 2] It's not enough to keep animals
and exhibits just for people to look at.</i>

01:02.830 --> 01:04.997
<i>There has to be a higher purpose</i>

01:04.999 --> 01:08.600
<i>and for us it's conservation
of species in the wild.</i>

01:08.602 --> 01:10.268
We're rolling.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.771
<i>The general public would never
get the access that you're gonna get...</i>

01:12.773 --> 01:14.273
[woman 3] Good girl.

01:14.275 --> 01:18.143
<i>[man 2] ...which is to see what
goes on behind the scenes every day.</i>

01:18.145 --> 01:20.112
That's how we do it here
in the boogie down Bronx.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.413
[all laugh]

01:35.795 --> 01:37.196
[woman]
Look at him sit.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.965
It's checking you out.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.738
Endor. How are you doing,
sweetheart?

01:46.740 --> 01:49.241
[laughs] Are you tired?

01:50.910 --> 01:54.746
Endor's been my officemate
for about seven years now.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.815
What are you doing?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.750
<i>He had some medical issues.</i>

01:58.752 --> 02:01.587
He came from another facility
and he was used to people

02:01.589 --> 02:03.489
and not used to being
around other foxes

02:03.491 --> 02:06.225
<i>and we kind of hit it off.
We bonded.</i>

02:06.227 --> 02:09.194
He liked being in here
and I liked having him here.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.230
Hey, buddy.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.399
<i>Endor is a wonderful officemate.</i>

02:14.401 --> 02:18.770
<i>It used to just be Endor 'cause Endor
doesn't get along with other foxes,</i>

02:18.772 --> 02:22.274
<i>but for some reason,
Rue, he just took to her.</i>

02:23.042 --> 02:24.476
[Kathleen laughs]

02:26.880 --> 02:29.381
<i>Apparently we have 15 fennec
foxes here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

02:29.383 --> 02:33.085
<i>Some live at town, some
live at the old zebra house</i>

02:33.087 --> 02:36.021
<i>and we always have two on
exhibit at the children's zoo.</i>

02:36.189 --> 02:37.689
[man] Oh, that's so cool!

02:37.691 --> 02:40.926
<i>[Kathleen] I remember when I
was in college I would sneak over,</i>

02:40.928 --> 02:45.030
<i>cut a class or two and come to
see the foxes at the children's zoo.</i>

02:46.065 --> 02:48.267
<i>They fascinated me.
They were charmers.</i>

02:48.835 --> 02:50.802
Hello.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.005
Am I going to be in your way
if I make some enrichment?

02:53.007 --> 02:54.239
No, not at all.

02:55.875 --> 02:56.742
Not you, Grover.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.243
[Kathleen laughs]

02:59.412 --> 03:01.180
These are the small mealworms.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.383
It's fun to watch them dig for them
and try to get them out of the bag.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.718
<i>They're found in Africa.</i>

03:06.720 --> 03:10.789
<i>They're desert fox and they're
found north of the Sahara.</i>

03:10.791 --> 03:13.525
<i>In the wild, fennec foxes
hear insects and they dig.</i>

03:13.527 --> 03:17.029
So, what we do
is we hide them in a bag,

03:17.031 --> 03:20.866
they'll hear them, they have very
good hearing, but I help them out a little,

03:20.868 --> 03:22.067
I make a few holes.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.469
Okay.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.975
And look, he's stalking 'cause
he knows something's coming.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.343
Hey, guys.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.079
Oh, what do I got?

03:34.881 --> 03:36.248
Are you excited, buddy?

03:41.154 --> 03:42.254
[Kathleen laughs]

03:43.423 --> 03:44.990
What you got there, buddy?

03:48.428 --> 03:50.963
<i>It's really good to see him
this healthy.</i>

03:50.965 --> 03:55.667
Around nine months ago, the staff came
in the morning and found Endor panting,

03:55.669 --> 03:57.536
open-mouth breathing.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.871
<i>He looked kind of weak
and lethargic.</i>

03:59.873 --> 04:03.875
<i>This was very acute. This was a
really quick change in his behavior.</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:06.645
He didn't look good
when I saw him.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.714
<i>So, he brought him over
to the health center.</i>

04:08.716 --> 04:12.217
<i>The cardiologist found
an extremely enlarged heart.</i>

04:12.852 --> 04:15.854
<i>They are all special,
but he's really special.</i>

04:15.856 --> 04:19.358
I think he's everyone's favorite
and it was just so sudden.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.226
You just didn't expect it.

04:22.829 --> 04:26.231
And I'm trying to keep my cool
in front of the vets and not cry.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.733
So, that was hard.

04:27.735 --> 04:31.370
The cardiologist said he had
one to maybe three months to live...

04:32.939 --> 04:35.173
and that was
ten months ago, so...

04:35.842 --> 04:38.110
We're gonna have
the cardiologists come back

04:38.112 --> 04:40.746
and do echocardiograms
on all our foxes

04:40.748 --> 04:45.751
to see if this is something we
should expect in older foxes.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.586
A part of me is worried
that the echocardiogram

04:47.588 --> 04:49.688
will show no change
in his heart.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.391
I don't think that's the case,
but it's in the back of my mind.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.160
He's a fighter, my boy.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.168
[woman] Giraffe.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.242
Hello, Asani.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.720
We just have to close that,
so the owls don't escape.

05:21.787 --> 05:23.689
Morning.

05:23.691 --> 05:28.493
I'm in the aardvark exhibit
in the Carter Giraffe Building.

05:28.495 --> 05:33.799
I'm filling in all the holes
that Arthur dug yesterday.

05:33.801 --> 05:38.804
We have three aardvarks,
Amani, Arthur and Hoover.

05:38.806 --> 05:42.808
Aardvarks live
in very dry areas in Africa.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.443
This area mimics it.

05:46.045 --> 05:49.014
So, those are two scop owls.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.682
They're also found in Africa.

05:50.684 --> 05:55.120
They like to just watch
and see what I'm doing.

05:55.122 --> 05:59.091
See what he's doing now, this
little head bob, like, "I see you."

05:59.859 --> 06:01.159
Good morning.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.062
It's time for school.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.069
Are you ready
to go have some fun?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.740
Arthur is on exhibit.

06:14.742 --> 06:19.611
And so, now he'll probably
go into his little den.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.847
We do have a second male
and his name is Hoover

06:21.849 --> 06:25.484
and currently
he's in his holding area.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.086
Now that we're all done,
we can go and feed Hoover.

06:31.257 --> 06:34.426
Aardvarks do eat avocado,
they actually love it.

06:34.428 --> 06:39.131
So, I'll crush it all up for Hoover
and I'll kind of make him guacamole.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.867
All I need is toast.
I can make him avocado toast.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.301
Make him into a hipster.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.705
Aardvarks eat a lot of bugs.

06:46.707 --> 06:50.175
So, what we'll do with him
is we'll give him super worms

06:51.577 --> 06:53.412
and then we'll go
and check on Hoover

06:53.414 --> 06:55.247
and see
how he's doing this morning.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.950
So, down this way.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.853
So, in the morning whenever
we first check on the aardvarks,

07:01.855 --> 07:02.821
our lights are on.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.758
Aardvarks are nocturnal animals,

07:06.760 --> 07:10.095
so we have them
on a reverse light cycle.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.365
Good morning, Hoover.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.102
Come on, Hoover.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.272
Come get your avocado
and your buggies.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.876
All right.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.645
I would kind of describe
Hoover like an old man.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.948
He wants what he wants,

07:29.950 --> 07:32.684
or he'll let you know, like, "No, get
out of my house." Like, "This is mine."

07:32.686 --> 07:33.585
[Cassy laughs]

07:33.587 --> 07:35.320
But he's good.
He's a great guy.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.723
<i>I don't feel like I'm working,
you know.</i>

07:38.725 --> 07:40.358
<i>Like, I love coming here,</i>

07:40.360 --> 07:43.595
<i>whether it's cleaning up
after the animals all day long,</i>

07:43.597 --> 07:46.932
<i>or I get that five minutes
of getting to talk to them</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:48.600
<i>and building that relationship,</i>

07:48.602 --> 07:49.835
like, that makes it all worth it

07:49.837 --> 07:53.038
and, you know,
I love these guys.

07:53.806 --> 07:59.144
So, Hoover is 130 pounds
of pure muscle.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.646
So, he's definitely
a strong animal.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.282
They have enormous power
in their legs.

08:04.383 --> 08:07.152
<i>Aardvarks have
a very strong tail.</i>

08:07.154 --> 08:11.690
<i>It's very muscular, kind of, like a
kangaroo's tail and it'll help them balance.</i>

08:11.692 --> 08:15.594
They can also, kind of, use it
if a predator comes along

08:15.596 --> 08:16.995
and they, kind of,
just, like, whip around

08:16.997 --> 08:20.298
and their tail, once they
hit you, like, you'll know.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.901
It's very, very, strong.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.538
<i>For the past couple of years,
Hoover has had a tail injury</i>

08:26.540 --> 08:28.874
and we're not exactly sure
why it happened,

08:28.876 --> 08:30.842
um, whether he nicked it
on something,

08:30.844 --> 08:34.246
or if he accidentally
caught it with his nails.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.414
<i>So, tomorrow,
we do have a procedure</i>

08:36.416 --> 08:38.850
<i>where we will have to immobilize
him to change that bandage</i>

08:38.852 --> 08:40.485
<i>and clean out the wound,</i>

08:40.487 --> 08:42.587
<i>but hopefully
we can get to a point</i>

08:42.589 --> 08:44.256
<i>where we no longer
have to do that.</i>

08:45.525 --> 08:47.959
He'll most likely,
probably go back to bed.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.129
It's like, "Hi, guys,
how are we doing?"

08:59.405 --> 09:01.039
[man] Morning, Dave.

09:01.041 --> 09:05.176
This exhibit features one of
my favorite species of bird,

09:05.645 --> 09:07.445
the western capercaillie.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.149
I've loved birds
since I was a little kid.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.320
<i>When I was really young,
I really loved dinosaurs.</i>

09:15.322 --> 09:17.556
<i>I always tell people
if you love dinosaurs,</i>

09:17.558 --> 09:21.026
<i>the closest thing you could get
to really are modern day birds.</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:25.830
<i>Every day, I make
a really, really good attempt</i>

09:25.832 --> 09:28.433
<i>at seeing every bird
in the collection if I can.</i>

09:33.439 --> 09:34.839
<i>We all got into this profession</i>

09:34.841 --> 09:37.642
<i>because we love animals,
so you don't wanna go too long</i>

09:37.644 --> 09:39.444
<i>without spending time with them.</i>

09:41.414 --> 09:43.715
<i>Yeah, the inquisitiveness
is a mutual feeling</i>

09:43.717 --> 09:47.252
between, you know, us, the staff
here, and the birds themselves.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.691
[man] You've seen
this bird before, eh.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.327
[Chuck] Yep, I saw it
shortly after it arrived.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.798
<i>A new female golden eagle
just arrived at the zoo.</i>

09:59.800 --> 10:00.599
[man] There she is.

10:00.666 --> 10:04.235
Ah, she's really pretty!

10:04.237 --> 10:09.007
She looks like in perfect condition.
She doesn't have a droop wing.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.277
[Chuck] I mean, you know, usually
when you see them with the wing injuries,

10:12.279 --> 10:15.614
it's usually, can be obvious.

10:15.616 --> 10:21.653
<i>This bird came from a wildlife
rehabilitator in Utah and has a wing injury.</i>

10:21.655 --> 10:23.622
<i>More specifically,
it has a clavicle injury</i>

10:23.624 --> 10:26.691
which is a piece
of bird's wishbone.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.594
<i>It was suspected to
have a collision with a car.</i>

10:29.596 --> 10:33.932
Her injury doesn't allow her
to fly for great lengths

10:33.934 --> 10:35.734
and it wouldn't allow her
to hunt prey and eat,

10:35.736 --> 10:38.169
so, she's deemed non-releasable.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.873
[man] People always think
the bald eagle's so spectacular,

10:41.875 --> 10:43.742
- but I think that--
- [Chuck] Yeah.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.410
[man] I mean,
I really like the Goldens.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.048
<i>I've been at the zoo
for a long time</i>

10:50.050 --> 10:52.217
and come in contact with
all these different animals

10:52.219 --> 10:53.785
and all these different species

10:53.787 --> 10:58.289
and sometimes there's just some individual
animal that you're just drawn to.

10:59.425 --> 11:02.594
<i>With the golden eagle,
they're my favorite.</i>

11:02.596 --> 11:04.696
The first time I saw one
in the wild was out west,

11:04.698 --> 11:07.298
but I've seen them here now,
in New York.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.602
<i>The range of golden eagles
is pretty wide</i>

11:10.604 --> 11:12.871
<i>because they're found
across Europe and Asia</i>

11:12.873 --> 11:16.541
<i>and since the '70s and
the Endangered Species Act,</i>

11:16.543 --> 11:18.743
<i>all these species
were given broad protection</i>

11:18.745 --> 11:22.380
<i>and with the decreased use
of pesticides,</i>

11:22.382 --> 11:26.718
<i>their populations have grown and
now you can see them on the east coast.</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:29.054
So, several years ago we got
this immature eagle here.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.622
<i>That was pretty exciting
at the time</i>

11:30.689 --> 11:34.626
<i>because then there weren't a lot
of golden eagles in New York state.</i>

11:34.628 --> 11:36.795
<i>So, we kept the bird here
and restored it to health</i>

11:36.797 --> 11:40.165
<i>and then sent it on
to a rehabilitator.</i>

11:40.167 --> 11:43.401
<i>We were actually able
to go with the rehabilitator</i>

11:43.403 --> 11:45.370
<i>to release the eagle
back into the wild</i>

11:45.372 --> 11:47.439
<i>and it was really, really,
a cool story.</i>

11:48.641 --> 11:52.677
It would be great to have golden
eagles back on exhibit here again.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.380
[Chuck] Yeah, I would... We'd
love to have them back on exhibit.

11:56.782 --> 11:59.751
Because of COVID,
rehabilitators are in a tough spot

11:59.753 --> 12:02.353
because they can't move
birds to zoos and nature centers

12:02.355 --> 12:03.655
like they would have
in the past.

12:03.657 --> 12:07.525
So, unfortunately, some birds
are gonna have to be euthanized

12:07.527 --> 12:11.696
<i>that would normally have been sent
to a zoo or a nature center for a home.</i>

12:11.698 --> 12:13.898
You have the space
in the aviary for her?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.800
[Chuck] We could move animals
around and make the space

12:15.802 --> 12:18.636
for golden eagles over there
for sure.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.639
[Jim] It's just really nice
when we are able to step up

12:21.641 --> 12:25.677
and actually save a bird
and provide that bird a home.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.612
This golden eagle will
receive a health assessment

12:27.614 --> 12:30.281
before it leaves
the wildlife health center.

12:30.283 --> 12:34.352
<i>Then we have to completely
redo her exhibit with her in mind</i>

12:34.354 --> 12:39.124
and then, after that she'll go on exhibit
at the birds of prey area of the Bronx Zoo.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.763
<i>[man] Some people would prefer
not to work in the bug room.</i>

12:44.765 --> 12:46.765
I would be in there everyday
if I could.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.833
<i>The world wouldn't function
without them.</i>

12:48.835 --> 12:51.069
It looks like one's trying
to get out on me.

12:51.904 --> 12:54.405
He's not allowed to do that.

12:59.879 --> 13:00.912
[girl] Wow!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.787
<i>[man] Hoover is one
of our male aardvarks.</i>

13:08.789 --> 13:12.857
<i>We've been working on
Hoover's tail for a couple of years.</i>

13:12.859 --> 13:15.560
<i>We kept getting really close
to being healed</i>

13:15.562 --> 13:16.494
<i>and then we get
all these setbacks</i>

13:16.496 --> 13:19.097
<i>and so, this time, we've decided</i>

13:19.099 --> 13:23.635
<i>that we really need to change his bandage
every other day for the past couple months.</i>

13:23.637 --> 13:25.336
So, we have to anesthetize him,

13:25.338 --> 13:28.072
so that we can change
this bandage,

13:28.074 --> 13:32.377
clean the wound off and get a
new bandage on there, safely.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.480
That was a good injection.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.714
We're gonna bring
the rest of our stuff

13:36.716 --> 13:38.983
and wait for him to go
to sleep and then we'll go in.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.957
- Feels pretty good.
- [woman] Yeah.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.759
[John] I think we're okay.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.227
[woman]
Wanna hit the lights, Cassy?

13:52.331 --> 13:54.399
<i>[John] They call it
happy tail syndrome.</i>

13:54.401 --> 13:57.602
<i>Dogs, they get so excited
and they bang it against things.</i>

13:57.604 --> 14:00.038
<i>So, sometimes, Hoover
bangs his tail against things</i>

14:00.040 --> 14:02.507
and we get a little setback,
making it hard to heal.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.009
So, the bandage
really helps to protect it.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.314
<i>Aardvark are really
interesting creatures.</i>

14:09.316 --> 14:13.384
When we put stitches in, the
skin doesn't just glue together,

14:13.386 --> 14:17.055
like it does in almost all of the
other animals that we work with.

14:17.057 --> 14:21.292
<i>And so, we've had a lot of
trouble getting the tail to heal.</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:24.629
So close.

14:24.631 --> 14:29.234
<i>We're really not sure why aardvark's skin
doesn't heal the way we'd expect it to,</i>

14:29.236 --> 14:31.402
<i>but we've seen that
in other aardvark here</i>

14:31.404 --> 14:34.339
<i>and we know that other zoos
have seen that in their aardvark.</i>

14:35.474 --> 14:38.409
There is still a little opening.

14:39.778 --> 14:42.046
<i>What we have found
has been most successful</i>

14:42.048 --> 14:45.383
<i>for Hoover's tail,
is to put sugar on the wound.</i>

14:46.518 --> 14:47.719
<i>We have tried honey,</i>

14:47.721 --> 14:50.288
but we just found
that the sugar works better.

14:51.323 --> 14:54.626
<i>If you think of your
jar of sugar at home,</i>

14:54.628 --> 14:58.563
<i>it doesn't grow anything in it unlike
your bread that goes bad in a week.</i>

14:58.565 --> 15:02.667
Sugar actually prevents
the growth of bacteria

15:02.669 --> 15:08.273
and fungus and it keeps the
tail really clean and healthy.

15:08.275 --> 15:12.810
<i>So, we need to keep dry sugar
on this wound at all times</i>

15:12.812 --> 15:16.381
<i>and that means we have to change
the sugar bandage every two days.</i>

15:16.749 --> 15:20.018
[John speaking]

15:21.954 --> 15:23.554
For the past two years
that I've been working here,

15:23.556 --> 15:26.057
you know,
he's always had this issue

15:26.059 --> 15:28.793
<i>and every time you have an
animal that gets knocked down,</i>

15:28.795 --> 15:30.929
<i>it's a risk that you are taking.</i>

15:30.931 --> 15:32.397
[John] Let's go ahead
and wake him up.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.098
[Cassy] Okay.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.833
[John] Hoover's tail
is really looking great,

15:35.835 --> 15:38.569
but I think he still needs
some padding on there,

15:38.571 --> 15:40.672
just to get it
all the way healed.

15:40.674 --> 15:44.776
So, we're gonna try to put a
bandage on there that has no sugar in it

15:44.778 --> 15:48.046
and see if we can do that awake
without actually anesthetizing him.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.347
[Cassy] Great.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.149
[woman] Good night.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.718
Good boy.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.154
[woman laughs]

16:01.827 --> 16:02.927
See a lot of duck out there?

16:02.929 --> 16:04.095
[girl] Yeah.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.499
[man 1] Yep, the scales
back there. Got the long net.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.802
Do you know
which one you wanna go?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.504
[man 2] I was gonna actually get
the same thing, it doesn't matter.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.806
The male will be the easy one.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.341
[man 3] Yeah, maybe
we just do him first.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.143
[man 1] All right.
Let's get him done first then.

16:19.145 --> 16:23.614
[man 2] So let's... I'm gonna circle
around the front, see where he goes.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.384
[Chuck] <i>We're about to
catch a couple of king vultures</i>

16:26.386 --> 16:29.253
<i>in preparation to make room
for the new golden eagle</i>

16:29.822 --> 16:32.223
<i>that's moving over
to this exhibit.</i>

16:39.798 --> 16:41.866
King vultures
they're really agile.

16:41.868 --> 16:45.370
<i>They're capable of fast,
quick movements and turns.</i>

16:47.973 --> 16:50.241
[man 1] What? You got
him? Okay. He's yours.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.978
[man 2] Actually, Chuck, you hold
onto the feet there and I'll adjust.

16:57.583 --> 17:01.719
<i>[Chuck] Another challenge is, you do have
to be careful of their feet and their beak</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:04.155
because they can inflict
some damage with those.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.990
<i>My glasses are fogged.</i>

17:05.992 --> 17:08.860
<i>It definitely adds
a new challenge</i>

17:08.862 --> 17:10.161
when you can't see
what you're doing.

17:10.796 --> 17:11.662
I got it.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.033
- [man 1] You okay?
- [Chuck] Yeah. Cool.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.737
<i>They look great.
They're overall very calm</i>

17:19.739 --> 17:21.272
<i>which we're happy with</i>

17:21.274 --> 17:24.842
<i>and next we're going to bring
them to the back of World of Birds.</i>

17:24.844 --> 17:26.878
[Kevin] Let's take them
to their new home.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.945
- What do you say?
- [Chuck] Let's do it.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.213
[Kevin] All right.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.392
Take your time. Yep, got it.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.263
[Chuck] I wanna go sideways.

17:49.368 --> 17:50.234
[man] Okay. We good?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.436
- [Kevin] Yeah.
- [Chuck] Let's do it.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.271
[Kevin] Hello, honey.

17:55.607 --> 17:58.609
<i>[Chuck] Now that this pair of
king vultures has moved over here,</i>

17:58.611 --> 18:01.412
<i>we still have to re-perch
an entire exhibit</i>

18:01.414 --> 18:03.815
<i>to make it appropriate
for the golden eagle.</i>

18:03.817 --> 18:05.216
They look really good.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.920
[Kathleen] Hi, handsome.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.423
You want it to be good, but
you're prepared for it not to be good.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.225
All right, little man,
I'll see you later.

18:18.564 --> 18:22.066
<i>[man 1] What we're gonna do
is slowly but surely</i>

18:22.068 --> 18:24.035
<i>inch our way in
through a tight door.</i>

18:24.037 --> 18:27.071
- [man 2] Oh, man, so close!
- [Kevin] Hold on, hold on.

18:30.976 --> 18:31.709
[woman] Are they your friends?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.144
Yeah.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.421
[man] We're in the bug room
in Jungle World.

18:47.659 --> 18:50.361
And this is where we breed
all of our insects for display.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.465
<i>Some people would prefer
not to work in the bug room.</i>

18:54.467 --> 18:56.868
It's just natural that some people
aren't as excited about bugs,

18:56.870 --> 19:00.204
but I would be
in there every day if I could.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.507
<i>I always loved insects as a kid.</i>

19:02.509 --> 19:05.643
<i>I just think it's because they're
so much different than us.</i>

19:05.645 --> 19:09.480
<i>They're decomposers. They eat
other insects that can be pests.</i>

19:09.482 --> 19:12.250
<i>They can defoliate
bushes and plants</i>

19:12.252 --> 19:16.821
<i>and allow other plants to grow
and recycle nutrients from the leaves.</i>

19:16.823 --> 19:19.056
<i>The world wouldn't function
without them.</i>

19:20.325 --> 19:21.425
So, this is one of our
egg containers

19:21.427 --> 19:24.562
that we have
for hatching stick insects

19:24.564 --> 19:28.132
and it looks like there are some
nymphs in here that hatched overnight.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.834
They're pretty active
when they're born

19:29.836 --> 19:32.103
and they have a really
cool coloration.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.639
Their legs are striped.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.340
It looks like one's trying
to get out on me.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.343
He's not allowed to do that.

19:43.448 --> 19:47.652
We have three adults in this
larger tank, one male, two females.

19:47.654 --> 19:51.722
Their really only line of
defense is they're super cryptic.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.991
They blend in really well
with their surroundings.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.093
Let me pick up a female.

19:57.763 --> 20:02.133
Yeah. This is the female and
she's a little anxious right now.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.172
So, you can really see her size.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.044
Here's a male and you can see
the male's super different.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.745
The male is really small.
This is an adult.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.782
He's really skinny.
He has different coloration.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.085
He's green and black and they
have little spikes on their legs.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.854
So, after
the adult insects mate,

20:23.856 --> 20:26.524
they'll drop their eggs
in the substrate.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.993
You have to search
through this cocoa mulch

20:28.995 --> 20:33.331
that has a bunch of eggs in it and
pick out which ones are the eggs.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.366
They look like little seeds.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.269
And when we get a couple
hundred of these eggs,

20:38.271 --> 20:41.005
we will set up
a egg hatching tank.

20:41.007 --> 20:44.976
By then it will be about a
month before they start hatching.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.412
These are our
Philippine leaf insects.

20:48.414 --> 20:52.416
We just received this colony from
the Long Island Aquarium last week

20:52.418 --> 20:56.520
and this is the first time we've ever
had this species at the Bronx Zoo.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.889
They are related to the stick
insects that we already have here,

20:58.891 --> 21:01.425
but they've developed
a really cool body form

21:01.427 --> 21:03.160
that looks exactly like a leaf.

21:04.529 --> 21:05.730
So, this is an adult female
right here.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.833
You can see her wings
look like leaf veins.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.569
She's moving back and forth
as she's walking.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.971
It looks like what a leaf
would do in the wind.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.941
These guys will eventually be
exhibited in Jungle World

21:16.943 --> 21:19.210
along with
our giant stick insects.

21:19.212 --> 21:21.345
It's really nice to have
a rotating colony.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.817
<i>I think it's really important to have
insects on exhibit at the Bronx Zoo</i>

21:26.819 --> 21:29.487
<i>to inspire another generation
of, you know, zookeepers</i>

21:29.489 --> 21:30.988
<i>and stewards of the environment</i>

21:30.990 --> 21:33.324
<i>and people who are excited
about insects.</i>

21:33.326 --> 21:35.593
That was me, you know,
a while back.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.329
So, I think it's a really
important thing that we can do.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.712
[man]
Here's the game plan, Leela.

21:54.714 --> 21:59.817
So, this perch and this little perch
here, so we gotta dig those out.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.619
Dig out the rocks and whatever
broken stump is down there too.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.255
So, if you wanna start
hauling these out...

22:04.257 --> 22:07.058
The pair of king vultures
have been doing very well.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.593
<i>They seem really calm
and comfortable.</i>

22:09.595 --> 22:11.395
So, that's pretty encouraging.

22:14.633 --> 22:17.501
[Kevin] So, we moved
the king vultures out.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.070
Got it tuned, time's happening.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.938
When did we move the kings?
Was the kings yesterday?

22:20.940 --> 22:21.639
[Chuck] It was yesterday.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.307
[Kevin] Jiminy Christmas.

22:23.309 --> 22:27.511
And we are now trying to get
this set up for our golden eagle

22:27.513 --> 22:30.981
because you have a bird that's
bigger than the king vultures,

22:30.983 --> 22:36.020
so, we gotta make sure that bird
has space to open his wings up.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.022
- Is that even loose?
- [man] Oh, yeah!

22:38.024 --> 22:39.423
- [Kevin] Is it?
- [man] Yep.

22:39.758 --> 22:40.958
[Kevin] Watch it, Leela.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.361
- [Leela] Don't drop it on me.
- [Kevin] You got most of it.

22:54.673 --> 22:57.875
[Kevin]
This is a perfect can perch.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.578
It's ugly
and it's old and it's oak.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.813
[man] One, two, three.

23:02.815 --> 23:06.617
[Ken] So, this is soon to be our
golden eagle perch that we're bringing in.

23:06.619 --> 23:10.054
Females are generally a
third larger with birds of prey.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.891
So, she needs a sizeable spot
for her big feet and her big talons,

23:13.893 --> 23:15.526
so, she can grab hold.

23:15.528 --> 23:18.963
And what we're gonna do
is slowly but surely

23:18.965 --> 23:22.032
<i>inch our way in
through a tight door.</i>

23:22.034 --> 23:23.200
[man] I got it.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.035
I got a lot of it, but I got it.

23:27.439 --> 23:28.472
Oh, man!

23:28.573 --> 23:30.207
- [Kevin] Hold on, hold on.
- [man] It's so close.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.909
[Kevin] No, no, no,
we're almost there.

23:31.911 --> 23:32.843
We're almost there. Yep.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.412
All right, lower.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.781
- [Leela] Lower?
- [man] Lower a little bit.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.948
Okay, let's go down.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.717
Okay, we're right
at the lip of the hole.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.485
[Kevin]
Two going in under the tree.

23:41.487 --> 23:42.953
- All right?
- [man] And in.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.923
[Kevin] That's what
Ken wants, right there.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.358
All right, go out
and look at it.

23:50.796 --> 23:51.762
[Ken] It's good.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.731
It's not perfect, but it's good.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.066
<i>You're creating something.
You're building something.</i>

23:56.068 --> 23:58.436
It's sort of like building
a house but for a bird.

23:58.970 --> 23:59.903
It's a bit of a crisscross.

23:59.905 --> 24:03.040
[Kevin] That's fine.
You can turn it back.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.811
It's worth the extra effort to
try to get it right for the animal.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.146
[Kevin] Yeah, let's spin it
back this way just a little bit.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.015
How's that?

24:11.349 --> 24:12.650
[Ken]
Yeah, I like that better.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.486
[Kevin] You like that
better? I like better. All right.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.688
[Ken] I think that looks
good. I say we set it.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.990
- [Kevin] Let's do it.
- [Ken] Set it and forget it.

24:20.826 --> 24:22.827
[man]
Just gonna twist that off.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.629
[Ken] Our female golden
eagle has multiple options

24:25.631 --> 24:27.064
on how to get up
to our perching.

24:27.066 --> 24:30.668
So, she can jump from
this rock up to this perch.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.736
When she's there,
she can go to that spot.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.972
She can come up here.
She's got lots of options.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.141
And so, that's what
we're looking for.

24:39.911 --> 24:44.014
I work this hard on this stuff because the
animals demand it, so, it's what they need.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.283
It's my job is to give them
what they need.

24:48.119 --> 24:52.223
The next step for us here is put our
golden eagle in and see how she does.

24:57.195 --> 24:58.362
[Kathleen] Hey, buddy.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.297
Hi, handsome.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.402
The cardiologist was scheduled
to come in today.

25:05.404 --> 25:09.607
Yesterday we were in my office
and his appetite is good.

25:09.609 --> 25:14.979
He's jumping around great,
but he's breathing really rapidly.

25:15.747 --> 25:18.582
Just like last time we brought
Endor with his friend,

25:18.584 --> 25:22.620
so, he wasn't lonely
to the animal health center.

25:22.622 --> 25:26.824
<i>And he is in an oxygen tank
right now just to help him breathe,</i>

25:26.826 --> 25:29.059
take some of the pressure
off him.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.228
Here you go, sweetie.

25:31.596 --> 25:33.731
<i>You have to be optimistic.</i>

25:33.733 --> 25:37.268
<i>You have to be optimistic for
the animal's sake, but it's hard.</i>

25:37.270 --> 25:39.103
<i>There's such a dichotomy
of emotion right now.</i>

25:39.105 --> 25:42.540
<i>You want it to be good, but
you're prepared for it not to be good.</i>

25:42.542 --> 25:44.708
I'll come back for you.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.578
<i>Cardiologists agreed
to look at Endor,</i>

25:47.580 --> 25:50.247
<i>but also our 14 other foxes.</i>

25:50.849 --> 25:52.416
All right, little man,
I'll see you later.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.352
- [woman] Hello.
- [Kathleen] Hello.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.788
- So, this is Chickpoo.
- [woman] A girl.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.825
<i>[Kathleen] It was unfortunate for
Endor that he had this medical episode...</i>

26:01.827 --> 26:04.662
- [Kathleen] This one is Charlie.
- [man] Charlie.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.764
[Kathleen] <i>...but it's good
for foxes in the zoo population</i>

26:06.766 --> 26:08.732
<i>because now
we're gonna do a study</i>

26:08.734 --> 26:10.467
<i>to see if there's any
abnormalities in their hearts.</i>

26:10.469 --> 26:12.069
<i>Is it age-related?</i>

26:12.071 --> 26:15.739
Is Endor unusual or is this something
that progresses with the age?

26:15.741 --> 26:18.742
[man] If we can flip her.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.945
[Kathleen] <i>We wanna
do what's right for fennecs</i>

26:20.947 --> 26:22.580
<i>not here just at the Bronx Zoo,</i>

26:22.582 --> 26:25.416
but all over
North American zoos.

26:25.418 --> 26:28.285
- [woman] They're so good, aren't they?
- [Kathleen] They're so good.

26:28.687 --> 26:30.354
[man] All right. Sounds good.

26:31.690 --> 26:36.193
They all appeared normal
and we got a good baseline.

26:36.195 --> 26:40.164
So, we can characterize them
as a population.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.667
- [woman] So, I'm gonna work the door and you grab him.
- [Kathleen] Sure.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.903
Come on, bud.

26:45.905 --> 26:49.440
<i>Many, many, years ago, Endor
was put on a low protein diet.</i>

26:49.442 --> 26:53.410
<i>Sometimes a lack of taurine
might affect the heart.</i>

26:53.412 --> 26:57.314
<i>Taurine is an amino acid and
it's very important for heart health.</i>

26:57.316 --> 26:59.583
So, we thought
adding supplemental taurine

26:59.585 --> 27:03.587
would help repair his heart or
at least stop further damage.

27:03.589 --> 27:08.092
<i>The other option is that his
heart is not repairing itself</i>

27:08.094 --> 27:11.362
and eventually might
succumb to heart disease.

27:13.832 --> 27:14.598
[man] All right.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.799
[Kathleen] Endor!

27:15.801 --> 27:17.301
[woman] You're gonna
take a listen first?

27:17.303 --> 27:20.537
[Kathleen] Okay. You just
tell me how you want him.

27:20.539 --> 27:25.909
Back in December, Endor had signs of
heart failure, some respiratory distress.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.579
We looked at the heart and at that
time the heart was very enlarged.

27:28.581 --> 27:31.048
Breathing much better.

27:32.550 --> 27:36.720
[Kathleen] I mean, he's been
doing great up until yesterday.

27:36.722 --> 27:40.157
- [Dennis] I'm glad he's feeling better.
- [Kathleen] Yeah.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.794
I mean, he made it past the...
You gave him a month, remember?

27:43.796 --> 27:47.031
I was mad at you.
I was really mad.

27:51.903 --> 27:55.973
[Dennis] Yeah, so unfortunately
it's still very enlarged.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.810
[Kathleen] As in--

27:59.812 --> 28:02.613
[Dennis] This chamber is
probably twice as big as it should be,

28:02.615 --> 28:04.248
that left atrium.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.651
[Kathleen] How does that
compare to December?

28:07.653 --> 28:09.853
[Dennis]
Pretty much it's the same.

28:09.855 --> 28:13.457
So, before we were hopeful
maybe it was a diet, nutritional,

28:13.459 --> 28:16.994
and I think there was
a component of it for sure.

28:16.996 --> 28:21.098
The fact that it's been almost
ten months, you know,

28:21.100 --> 28:25.202
it's definitely ahead
of the estimated trajectory

28:25.204 --> 28:28.238
of, like, a primary dilated
cardiomyopathy in dogs,

28:29.307 --> 28:33.077
but there is a primary
cardiomyopathy component here.

28:34.112 --> 28:34.545
- Sorry.
- [Kathleen] Thank you.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.713
Me too.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.948
- [Dennis] He's feeling better already.
- [woman] Yeah.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.017
[Kathleen] And he proved you
wrong, so, I'm happy about that.

28:40.019 --> 28:40.884
[all laugh]

28:40.886 --> 28:42.152
[Dennis] He did.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.254
- [Kathleen] Thank you.
- [Dennis] Uh-huh.

28:45.690 --> 28:47.858
<i>[Kathleen] Basically,
his heart hasn't improved,</i>

28:47.860 --> 28:50.394
<i>but I don't think
it was much worse.</i>

28:51.396 --> 28:52.996
You did good, Endor.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.032
I really thought...

29:03.608 --> 29:06.043
[John]
<i>Hoover is just too powerful.</i>

29:06.045 --> 29:08.545
We need to be safe
and careful with him.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.949
- [John] Okay, okay, okay.
- [Cassy] Hopefully it works.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.585
- [woman] See them up there?
- [girl] Yeah.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.253
[woman] Yeah.

29:24.129 --> 29:30.067
[Cassy] I am prepping a avocado
guacamole mix for Hoover.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.737
<i>In the past we had
to immobilize Hoover</i>

29:33.739 --> 29:39.743
to change his tail bandage, but today
he'll be fully awake for the procedure.

29:39.745 --> 29:42.513
The avocado
is gonna be a distraction.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.815
Um, avocado is
one of his favorite things,

29:44.817 --> 29:47.384
but to keep him
really enticed, we add bugs.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.453
Hopefully it works.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.658
<i>[John] The goal today
is to take this bandage off</i>

29:54.660 --> 29:57.094
<i>and put a fresh one on</i>

29:57.096 --> 30:00.430
and hopefully Hoover will let
us do all of that with him awake.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.968
[Cassy]
Want to eat some avocado?

30:04.970 --> 30:06.804
<i>[John] The most important part
for Hoover's bandage change</i>

30:06.806 --> 30:10.307
<i>is to try to get some padding
back on the tail,</i>

30:10.909 --> 30:12.776
<i>but we don't have to get
everything off</i>

30:12.778 --> 30:14.578
and we don't have
to put any sugar in there.

30:14.580 --> 30:19.082
So, hopefully, this will be easier
than a regular bandage change.

30:22.554 --> 30:26.023
<i>If Hoover were a dog and
we were changing his bandage</i>

30:26.025 --> 30:28.692
<i>and he didn't really like it too
much, we would just hold him...</i>

30:28.694 --> 30:29.893
[Cassy] Okay.

30:29.895 --> 30:32.095
<i>[John] ...but Hoover
is just too powerful</i>

30:32.097 --> 30:34.431
<i>and he's got claws on his legs.</i>

30:35.567 --> 30:38.068
[Cassy] He might back up.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.070
<i>[John] We need to be safe
and careful with him.</i>

30:42.574 --> 30:46.276
<i>It's kind of like taking off
a band-aid.</i>

30:46.278 --> 30:50.347
<i>So, I have to try to get the tape
off without upsetting him too much,</i>

30:50.349 --> 30:54.184
<i>but really quickly and see if we
can get a bandage back on him.</i>

30:58.723 --> 31:01.725
<i>[Cassy] Hoover doesn't mind
whenever the keepers are touching his tail</i>

31:01.727 --> 31:03.894
because he's used to us
coming in there all the time...

31:03.896 --> 31:06.930
[John] Okay, okay, okay,
let me have it back.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.699
<i>[Cassy] ...but whenever
vet staff does come in,</i>

31:08.701 --> 31:11.168
<i>he does get
a little bit rambunctious.</i>

31:11.936 --> 31:14.938
[John] Try it a little later.
Let him settle down.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.173
We'll try it...
We'll try again.

31:16.407 --> 31:17.541
[Cassy] Sounds good.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.009
[John] We were able to get
Hoover's bandage off,

31:19.011 --> 31:20.611
<i>but it really
kind of irritated him.</i>

31:20.613 --> 31:23.113
<i>He was a little annoyed.
He was kicking a lot.</i>

31:23.115 --> 31:24.815
So, we're gonna
give him a little break

31:24.817 --> 31:28.252
and then hopefully we can get
a soft bandage on the tail.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.187
[Cassy] Ready for round two?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.588
- [John] We'll try.
- [Cassy] Okay.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.956
[John] Here we go.

31:36.961 --> 31:39.196
[Cassy]
That's for you. Come on.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.298
All right, good boy.

31:48.706 --> 31:50.107
Good boy.

31:53.945 --> 31:56.246
You're okay, buddy.
You're okay.

32:00.618 --> 32:02.119
All right.

32:08.693 --> 32:09.593
- [John] Okay.
- [Cassy] Nice work.

32:09.595 --> 32:10.961
- [John] Good.
- [Cassy chuckles]

32:10.963 --> 32:13.530
Let's just take it day by day.
It was good, perfect.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.198
[Cassy] Look at him.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.935
He's, like,
"I'm a happy camper right now.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.604
I got my avocado.
I got my bug."

32:20.606 --> 32:22.906
He's in, like, aardvark heaven.

32:22.908 --> 32:24.942
[John] This has been
really successful for Hoover

32:24.944 --> 32:26.777
that we were able
to get the bandage off

32:26.779 --> 32:30.547
and put something back on
with him awake.

32:30.549 --> 32:35.719
Hoover really hasn't let us do this
much bandage change with him,

32:35.721 --> 32:39.122
so, it's a big step forward
to do this without anesthesia.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.437
Look, look. Look right there.

32:53.604 --> 32:55.305
You see it?

32:58.609 --> 33:01.244
[Chuck] <i>This morning we're
moving the female golden eagle</i>

33:01.246 --> 33:04.114
from the health center
to the eagle aviary exhibit.

33:09.787 --> 33:12.189
Hello. Good morning, lady.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.327
- [Ken] Never fails.
- [Chuck] Gonna let her...

33:20.531 --> 33:23.066
[Chuck] <i>The way we handle
this bird is we do it by hand.</i>

33:23.668 --> 33:26.003
Even though I'm excited
about doing this,

33:26.005 --> 33:27.771
you know,
you have to keep that calm

33:27.773 --> 33:30.273
<i>because birds pick up
on those sorts of things.</i>

33:33.111 --> 33:34.444
You're all right.
You're all right.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.252
Okay.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.854
All right, why don't you
take that one?

33:43.856 --> 33:44.888
[Ken] Her wings.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.356
[Chuck] I got it.

33:48.726 --> 33:50.193
- [Ken] Nice grab.
- [Chuck] Thanks.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.928
[Chuck] Thanks for the help.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.231
[Ken] I don't think
I really did much.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.866
Okay, I'm gonna let go
of the head.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.334
Hands out.

34:01.506 --> 34:03.573
It's been a nice smooth process.

34:03.575 --> 34:06.943
You wanna ride there
and put a hand on her.

34:06.945 --> 34:09.046
<i>We reworked some things
at eagle aviary.</i>

34:09.048 --> 34:12.115
<i>We moved two king vultures out
to make room for the golden eagle.</i>

34:12.117 --> 34:13.417
<i>We re-perched the exhibit,</i>

34:13.419 --> 34:15.152
so, it's really nice

34:15.154 --> 34:17.654
that this is kind of the last
step in the whole process.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.289
- [Chuck] Ready?
- [Ken] Yep, ready.

34:27.165 --> 34:29.766
- [Chuck] Say we'll release this way?
- [Ken] Yep.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.269
- [Chuck] Between those trees.
- [Ken] Good idea.

34:35.039 --> 34:38.075
- [Ken] There you go.
- [Chuck] All right.

34:38.077 --> 34:41.111
- [Chuck] Wow!
- [Ken] Looking majestic on that rock.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.579
[Chuck] Cool.

34:42.647 --> 34:45.549
So, we'll definitely keep a close
eye on her today, but she's...

34:45.551 --> 34:49.186
I think she'll really enjoy
this enclosure

34:49.188 --> 34:52.022
and she'll look
really, really, nice in here.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.992
She looks good.

34:55.994 --> 34:57.260
She looks...
She seems comfortable.

34:58.129 --> 34:59.863
She's a beautiful bird.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.164
[Ken] Yeah.

35:04.302 --> 35:06.770
<i>[Chuck] We weren't sure
of how she would maneuver</i>

35:06.772 --> 35:08.572
<i>in the new exhibit
given her injury.</i>

35:08.574 --> 35:12.509
Look up. Look at the eagle.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.817
[woman]
Let's take a look at his tail.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.285
[man]
Let's go look at his tail.

35:22.287 --> 35:25.655
<i>[woman] I'm here at the Carter
Building to look at Hoover's tail</i>

35:25.657 --> 35:27.757
to make sure that there's not
been any damage done to the tail

35:27.759 --> 35:28.992
now that the bandage is off.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.827
- [Susie] Hey, Hoover.
- [man] Hey, buddy.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.096
[Susie] <i>After a few
bandage changes done,</i>

35:33.098 --> 35:34.965
we could see
that the tail was healed

35:34.967 --> 35:37.067
and then felt confident
in leaving it off.

35:42.006 --> 35:43.240
That is closed.

35:44.075 --> 35:44.941
Looks awesome.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.710
Nice.

35:46.712 --> 35:50.313
I don't see any signs of redness or
openings coming. No discharge, no nothing.

35:50.882 --> 35:51.915
Do you want your treat?

35:51.917 --> 35:54.885
You've been such a good patient.

35:54.887 --> 35:57.254
Hi, Hoov.
Great to see your front end.

35:58.122 --> 35:59.556
Looks pretty good, huh?

35:59.558 --> 36:04.227
I mean, he's certainly bright and
eating. He's in good body condition.

36:05.863 --> 36:09.966
<i>Just seeing that animal's tail
healed is all I really need to see.</i>

36:09.968 --> 36:14.704
Him having joy and sucking down some
avocado and bugs is just icing on the cake.

36:14.706 --> 36:18.175
- Oh, look at you!
- [man] This way.

36:18.177 --> 36:21.411
You can see then underneath
of him if you shine your thing.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.015
[Susie] Yeah, it looks great.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.117
See you, bud.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.386
[man]
All right, enjoy your food.

36:32.056 --> 36:38.128
It takes a long time for them to get
through that process of fully healing.

36:38.629 --> 36:41.565
Hoover, good morning.

36:41.567 --> 36:45.535
<i>Now we're at the point where he
no longer has to wear a bandage.</i>

36:45.537 --> 36:50.941
We're making great progress into the
healing process and moving forward with him.

36:50.943 --> 36:55.011
So, as you can see, at
the very end of it, not open

36:55.013 --> 36:58.415
and it's healed and we're
gonna keep it that way.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.816
Right, Hoover?

37:00.551 --> 37:03.220
<i>I'll definitely be
popping in on him still.</i>

37:03.222 --> 37:05.789
Even whenever I'm cleaning,
I'll just be like, "Hey, Hoover."

37:05.823 --> 37:07.958
Have a good day, Hoover.

37:09.093 --> 37:12.095
<i>And just continue
that bond that we've built.</i>

37:12.797 --> 37:14.130
Good night.

37:22.139 --> 37:24.975
Look, right there in the tree.

37:25.743 --> 37:26.810
Oh, there he is!

37:26.812 --> 37:29.012
[woman] Ah, she's beautiful!

37:29.014 --> 37:30.614
- [man] That's it.
- Oh, yeah! Wow!

37:30.616 --> 37:32.983
Look, look at the eagle.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.186
- [Chuck] Hey, Jim.
- [Jim] How you doing?

37:37.188 --> 37:38.788
- [Chuck] Good. How are you?
- [Jim] Good. How's she doing?

37:38.790 --> 37:40.957
[Chuck] Pretty well, I think.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.995
She found a spot that she
really likes in the exhibit.

37:45.663 --> 37:48.732
We weren't exactly sure
of how she would maneuver

37:48.734 --> 37:50.767
in the new exhibit
given her injury.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.869
Turns out she maneuvers
really well in here

37:52.871 --> 37:56.606
and we were thinking
that might be a preferred spot

37:56.608 --> 37:58.441
once she gets familiar
with the enclosure

37:58.443 --> 38:01.144
because it's the highest point.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.747
[Jim] What's cool about her
up there is if the sun's out,

38:03.749 --> 38:08.752
you'll really be able to see the sun
kind of reflecting off that golden mantle.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.121
I'm glad we decided
to put her out on exhibit.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.058
<i>When most people in this
country think about eagles,</i>

38:15.060 --> 38:16.926
they think about the bald eagle

38:16.928 --> 38:18.361
because it's our
national symbol.

38:18.363 --> 38:21.564
So, that's why I feel it's important
to have golden eagles here too.

38:21.566 --> 38:25.135
<i>It helps us talk about another
important species of raptor</i>

38:25.137 --> 38:27.504
that's found in the US
and around the world.

38:27.506 --> 38:30.407
<i>They've become
one of my favorites.</i>

38:30.409 --> 38:32.709
[Chuck] It's really good to
have the species back here.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.779
[Jim] Oh, yeah, I'm gonna
keep coming by every day

38:35.781 --> 38:37.347
on my way home and look at her.

38:40.918 --> 38:42.452
[Kathleen] Good boy.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.520
Endor!

38:43.522 --> 38:46.122
<i>You look at Endor running
and moving around,</i>

38:46.124 --> 38:47.691
<i>you would think he was a 5-year-old
fox not a 10 and a half year old.</i>

38:47.693 --> 38:52.295
Look at that tail go.

38:58.202 --> 39:00.203
[man] Look, look, look, look.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.372
Do you see it?

39:10.081 --> 39:12.882
-[John] Hi. How are you?
-[Kathleen] I'm good. How are you?

39:12.884 --> 39:14.484
[John] Good, good.

39:14.486 --> 39:18.855
So, we have the results back
from all the foxes.

39:18.857 --> 39:22.359
You know, the good news is
most of the hearts look good.

39:23.394 --> 39:28.665
The level of taurine
in their blood is good.

39:28.667 --> 39:33.370
<i>It tells us we don't necessarily
need to change the fennec fox diet.</i>

39:33.372 --> 39:35.438
<i>That this study really
helps us get closer</i>

39:35.440 --> 39:38.341
to a time where we know exactly

39:38.343 --> 39:42.379
<i>what ages of fennec foxes we
need to start looking for heart disease,</i>

39:42.381 --> 39:45.882
<i>and then, we can really target
individuals as they hit that age and say,</i>

39:45.884 --> 39:49.853
<i>"Okay, now it's time to start
getting an echo for this animal."</i>

39:49.855 --> 39:53.156
So, I think
this is a really good start.

39:54.592 --> 39:55.759
Looking at Endor's blood work,

39:55.761 --> 39:58.661
it's clear
that he had low taurine

39:58.696 --> 40:00.997
when he was diagnosed
with heart disease

40:00.999 --> 40:04.968
and that the supplementation has
brought his taurine up, pretty high.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.770
[Kathleen]
He looks pretty good, right?

40:06.772 --> 40:07.837
[John] Yeah, he looks good.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.206
[Kathleen]
You know what tomorrow is?

40:10.208 --> 40:14.310
Tomorrow is the year
anniversary Endor was given his,

40:14.312 --> 40:16.579
"you're gonna die" sentence.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.782
- [John] Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah. He had a month to live.

40:18.784 --> 40:22.152
[John] He looks good right
now. He's looking good.

40:22.953 --> 40:26.856
[John] I am so happy Endor
was such a major part of this.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.391
He's the reason
we did this study.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.960
You gonna run around?

40:31.629 --> 40:33.930
- Good boy.
- [woman] Are you happy?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.399
- [Kathleen] He looks really good.
- [woman] He looks amazing.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.902
[Kathleen]
Look at that tail go.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.470
<i>Endor has been great.</i>

40:40.472 --> 40:45.708
He stayed another night at the health
center, so they could monitor him.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.912
<i>They weaned him off oxygen
and it showed no ill effects,</i>

40:48.914 --> 40:52.916
<i>so he came back and he's happy</i>

40:52.918 --> 40:55.318
<i>and his respiration rate
is great.</i>

40:56.987 --> 40:58.855
You look so good, buddy.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.824
Are you having fun out here?

41:00.826 --> 41:03.326
<i>When you look at Endor running
and moving around,</i>

41:03.328 --> 41:05.428
<i>you would think
he was a 5-year-old fox.</i>

41:05.430 --> 41:07.697
<i>There's something
about the fennec foxes,</i>

41:07.699 --> 41:08.898
they're these itty-bitty things,

41:08.900 --> 41:11.835
but they're so tough
and resilient.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.236
<i>Yeah, they're wonderful animals.</i>

41:13.238 --> 41:14.837
<i>We did tweak his medicine.</i>

41:14.972 --> 41:18.775
<i>We'll watch that, but he's staying
in my office with his buddy, Rue.</i>

41:18.777 --> 41:20.743
<i>He's gonna get outside time.</i>

41:20.745 --> 41:24.214
<i>He's gonna get his toys
and his enrichment.</i>

41:24.216 --> 41:27.150
He's gonna be the happiest
fennec fox in the world.

41:27.952 --> 41:29.886
Hi, my love.

41:29.888 --> 41:33.022
<i>Every day is a gift, but
we're gonna have many days.</i>

41:33.390 --> 41:34.958
But every day is a gift.
