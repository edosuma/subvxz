WEBVTT

00:11.433 --> 00:14.800
- Okay, Game Shakers.
I called this meeting because

00:14.900 --> 00:18.133
we gotta come up with a really
cool name for our new game.

00:18.233 --> 00:20.533
- Wait... what new game?

00:20.633 --> 00:23.467
- The game we've been working
on for the past two weeks.

00:23.567 --> 00:26.300
- With the giant skunks
that fly through space?

00:26.400 --> 00:29.433
- Trying to squirt
the chubby ballerinas?

00:29.533 --> 00:31.733
- And what's the name
of this game?

00:31.833 --> 00:36.333
- We don't have one yet!

00:36.433 --> 00:42.467
- Oooh! How about "Squirty
Skunkerinas"?

00:42.567 --> 00:46.067
- Hmmm... Well, I hate it.
Trip, what do you think?

00:48.567 --> 00:52.733
- Trip, are you
paying attention?

00:52.833 --> 00:55.333
- No.

00:55.433 --> 00:57.033
- Well, what are you doing?

00:57.133 --> 00:59.633
- I'm watching this crazy
story on the news.

00:59.733 --> 01:04.067
Look, a giant mega-shark died,
then washed up on the beach.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.500
- What's a mega-shark?

01:05.600 --> 01:07.800
- The biggest sharks
in the whole ocean.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.333
- Yeah, they're like five times
the size of a giant whale.

01:11.433 --> 01:15.633
- Whoa, sounds like
my grandfather's thumb.

01:17.167 --> 01:20.533
- Anyway... I feel sad
for the dead mega-shark.

01:20.633 --> 01:22.533
- Well, don't. That thing's
been takin' bites

01:22.633 --> 01:24.667
outta people all
up and down the coast

01:24.767 --> 01:26.700
for the past
20 years.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.967
- Whoa.
- Yikes.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.433
- Yeah, here check it out...

01:31.067 --> 01:35.233
- I'm here on Fire Island
with doctor, Edward Weiner.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.800
- That's correct.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.500
- Doctor Weiner, now that this
megashark has passed away,

01:39.600 --> 01:42.300
what are the plans
for its dead body?

01:42.400 --> 01:44.133
- Well, uhhh,
that's the problem.

01:44.233 --> 01:47.133
See, the mega-shark weighs
over four hundred tons.

01:47.233 --> 01:50.467
- And that's a lot of tons?

01:51.367 --> 01:53.600
- Okay. We're done.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.567
- Boo!

01:58.867 --> 02:02.133
- That almost killed us!

02:02.233 --> 02:05.833
- Ah, you all are just
a bunch of babies.

02:05.933 --> 02:07.967
Look, it didn't bother Hudson.

02:08.067 --> 02:10.400
- D'aahhhh!!!

02:11.933 --> 02:14.333
Don't do that!

02:14.433 --> 02:16.133
- C'mon, Trip, let's go eat.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.567
- Where you guys goin'?

02:17.667 --> 02:18.633
- To B.F. Wangs.

02:18.733 --> 02:21.433
We about to get
some waaaaaangs!

02:21.533 --> 02:23.733
- Uh... Dad, I can't hang
with you tonight.

02:23.833 --> 02:26.200
- Why can't you?
- Because mom's on her way

02:26.300 --> 02:28.467
here to come get me.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.733
- And thanks for
the coffee shampoo.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.133
- Your mom is on her way here?

02:36.233 --> 02:39.433
- Yeah, but--
- Aooohhh!

02:39.533 --> 02:40.700
How do you lock this door?

02:40.800 --> 02:43.967
Somebody show me how
to lock this door!

02:44.067 --> 02:46.233
- What's he freaking about?

02:46.333 --> 02:49.400
- Ah, my dad doesn't get along
too well with my mom.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.833
- Who would? She's a monster!

02:52.933 --> 02:55.367
- Hey, can you not talk
that way about Mom?

02:55.467 --> 02:58.467
- And anyway, if your ex-wife
is such a "monster,"

02:58.567 --> 03:00.467
then why did you marry her?

03:00.567 --> 03:02.567
- She didn't tell me she
was a monster

03:02.667 --> 03:05.433
until after
we got married.

03:05.533 --> 03:09.467
She lied to me!
I was bam-bizzled!

03:09.567 --> 03:12.567
Oh no! Here she comes!
I got to go!

03:12.667 --> 03:17.500
Hey, don't tell your mom...
I'm about to get some waaaangs.

03:20.467 --> 03:25.500
- Hey Mom!
- Hey Grover!

03:25.600 --> 03:28.967
- Uhhh... could you not call me
Grover in front of my friends?

03:29.067 --> 03:31.233
- Ohhh now.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.533
- Your real name is Grover?

03:33.633 --> 03:37.433
- Yes. And let us never
speak of it again.

03:38.833 --> 03:41.433
- Hey, I don't think she
looks like a monster.

03:41.533 --> 03:42.900
- Dude!
- Shhh!

03:43.067 --> 03:45.567
- Mmm, "monster?"
Well, I see that your dad's

03:45.667 --> 03:47.067
still saying nice
things about me.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.200
- Heh... yeah...

03:49.300 --> 03:50.767
- Hey! You gonna
introduce us?

03:50.867 --> 03:51.867
- Oh, uh... yeah yeah.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.067
Uhh... Mom, these are
the Game Shakers--

03:54.100 --> 03:55.467
This is Babe, Kenzie,
and Hudson.

03:55.567 --> 03:58.600
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.600
- And this is my mom,
Doctor Griffin.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.267
- Oh, please, call me Jackie,
and it's great to meet you kids.

04:03.367 --> 04:05.333
I have heard so much
about you from Grover.

04:05.433 --> 04:09.867
- D'ahhh!
- Oh! Sorry. Sorry. Triple G.

04:09.967 --> 04:11.500
- So, uh, what kinda
doctor are you?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.067
- I'm a pediatrician.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.167
- And what's that?

04:14.267 --> 04:17.800
Like a doctor of electricity?

04:17.900 --> 04:20.867
- A pediatrician is
a doctor for kids.

04:20.967 --> 04:24.500
- Oh. Then hey, can you check
out this weird lump on my back?

04:24.600 --> 04:26.067
- Gross...
- Hudson...

04:26.100 --> 04:28.500
- No, no, it's all right.
Let me check it out.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.233
- Ow ow owie ow ow ow...

04:31.333 --> 04:31.967
- Oh no.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.167
- What is it?

04:33.267 --> 04:34.800
- A gummy bear.

04:35.633 --> 04:38.333
- What is wrong with you?

04:38.433 --> 04:40.667
- Ewww...

04:40.767 --> 04:43.067
- So Mom, what are we
doing this weekend?

04:43.133 --> 04:46.067
- Well, since it's a holiday
weekend, I was thinking

04:46.133 --> 04:48.533
that we could take the boat out,
and go watch the fireworks.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.367
- Ahhh yes!
- Yeah?

04:50.467 --> 04:51.800
- You got your own boat?

04:51.900 --> 04:54.267
- Oh! Yeah, my dad bought
this big ol' yacht

04:54.367 --> 04:57.567
so he could say,
"I got a big ol' yacht!"

04:57.667 --> 05:01.700
- Ohhh, so when you
and Double G got divorced,

05:01.800 --> 05:05.867
you got to keep the yacht.
Nice work, sistah.

05:07.267 --> 05:11.133
- Eh actually, we uh...
"share custody" of the yacht.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.700
- Just with like me.

05:13.800 --> 05:18.600
- Sooo... you guys are gonna go
out on a yacht this weekend,

05:18.700 --> 05:22.167
to see fireworks. Ahhh...

05:22.267 --> 05:24.467
What are we doing, guys?

05:24.567 --> 05:30.167
- Oh well... I was just gonna
work on my basil garden.

05:30.267 --> 05:31.933
- I was gonna fly
this kite I made.

05:32.067 --> 05:34.067
- And I was just gonna sit
around, waiting to see

05:34.100 --> 05:37.700
if anyone wanted to invite me on
a boat and see some fireworks

05:37.800 --> 05:43.767
but, hey, what are the odds
of that happening?

05:44.400 --> 05:45.700
- Can I?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.733
- Go ahead.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.267
- You guys want to come
on a yacht with us?

05:49.367 --> 05:51.467
- Yes!
- Absatootly!

05:51.567 --> 05:52.433
- I'll bring the basil!

05:52.533 --> 05:54.200
- I'll bring my kite!

05:54.300 --> 05:57.800
- I'll try to talk 'em out of
bringing the basil and the kite.

05:58.933 --> 06:01.267
* Now let me see
The club go off *

06:01.367 --> 06:03.067
* When I step on the mic

06:03.100 --> 06:05.933

And it's popping tonight *

06:06.067 --> 06:09.467
* You know the whole squad

06:09.567 --> 06:11.233
* So when you hear
That beat bang *

* You better drop dat what

06:13.533 --> 06:16.600
* Wrist so icy
Man, I'm balling every day *

06:16.700 --> 06:19.733
* You can't shake my game
So just get up out my way *

06:19.833 --> 06:22.833
* Only bosses up in here
Homey, that's what's up *

06:22.933 --> 06:26.833
* So, DJ, bounce that bass
So I can drop dat what *

06:26.933 --> 06:30.067
* Drop dat
Let the bass get low *

06:30.167 --> 06:33.533
* Drop dat
And make the whole club go *

06:33.633 --> 06:36.467
* Drop dat

06:42.333 --> 06:44.133

06:53.467 --> 06:56.067
- And this is our boat.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.200
- No waaaaayyy.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.067
- Check out this yacht.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.633
- Dude, do you know what kinda
parties you could have

07:01.733 --> 07:02.733
on a boat like this?

07:02.833 --> 07:04.767
- Heh... Oh yeah.

07:04.867 --> 07:07.433
One time, my dad went to
a Jets game, and after it,

07:07.533 --> 07:11.767
he invited all the cheerleaders
from both teams on this boat

07:11.867 --> 07:14.500
and man, that party was
like one crazy...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.100
- Ahem...

07:16.200 --> 07:21.400
- ...like a crazy dream I had,
that never happened... mom.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
- Uh-huh.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.700
- Hey guys!

07:24.800 --> 07:28.167
Sorry I'm tardy.
I left my basil garden

07:28.267 --> 07:31.367
in my mom's car and I had
to go back and get it.

07:31.467 --> 07:34.067
- What is that?

07:34.167 --> 07:37.067
- What? What's funny
about basil?

07:37.167 --> 07:42.100
- Sorry. We're um... We're not
laughing at your basil...

07:42.200 --> 07:45.400
We're um... We're laughing
at your outfit.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.200
- Oh come on.
This is a poof suit.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.600
- Ohhhh.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.100
Then, quick question:
What's a poof suit?

07:54.200 --> 07:56.767
- It's a fashionable
flotation outfit.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.300
See, if the boat sinks,
I just press this little button

07:59.400 --> 08:01.700
right here, and K'POOF!

08:01.800 --> 08:05.200
I blow up like
a Kardashian's booty!

08:05.300 --> 08:08.567
- Well, Kenzie, I feel very
sure that our boat is not

08:08.667 --> 08:09.433
going to si--

08:09.533 --> 08:11.167
- Aahhhhhh!!!

08:11.267 --> 08:12.067
- Dad?!?

08:12.133 --> 08:13.267
- Oh no.

08:13.367 --> 08:17.267
- No. No! Bunny! Ruthless!
Call the Coast Guard!

08:17.367 --> 08:19.833
There's a creature from
the blue lagoon that did

08:19.933 --> 08:22.500
crawled up on my yacht!

08:22.600 --> 08:26.267
- Um, excuse me,
but this is our yacht.

08:26.367 --> 08:29.133
- Oh. Okay, well who bought
this yacht? Me!

08:29.233 --> 08:31.567
And what's the name
of this boat?

08:31.667 --> 08:34.967
The Dub Boat!

08:36.633 --> 08:37.767
- Oh, hey Jackie!

08:37.867 --> 08:39.067
- Good to see you, Jackie!

08:39.133 --> 08:40.633
- Don't be all
friendly to her!

08:40.733 --> 08:43.833
"Hi Jackie! Ohhh, good
to see you Jackie!

08:43.933 --> 08:47.467
Upjepbejupbupjupup."

08:47.567 --> 08:50.367
- Gale, will you please not
make a fool of yourself

08:50.467 --> 08:51.733
in front of these kids?

08:51.833 --> 08:54.600
- Nah it's okay.
We're so used to it.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.667
- We really are.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.833
- Dad... Mom's takin' us
to go see the fireworks.

08:58.933 --> 09:03.533
- False! Me, Bunny, and Ruthless
are taking this boat out!

09:03.633 --> 09:07.067
We are going fishing
for giant squid!

09:07.133 --> 09:08.133
- You know the rules...

09:08.233 --> 09:09.467
- Off my boat.

09:09.567 --> 09:12.667
- Whoever wants the boat has
to send an email one week

09:12.767 --> 09:13.733
ahead of time saying--

09:13.833 --> 09:16.067
[ blows air horn ]

09:16.100 --> 09:17.633

if you want.

09:17.733 --> 09:19.267
[ blows air horn ]

09:19.367 --> 09:21.200

09:31.967 --> 09:36.167
- Dude, your parents
are adorable together.

09:37.867 --> 09:41.333
- Look Dub... Jackie did
reserve the boat for today.

09:41.433 --> 09:43.200
- And you didn't!

09:43.300 --> 09:44.067
- Let me see that.

09:44.167 --> 09:48.667
Oh yeah, I see it right here!

09:48.767 --> 09:51.700
- It's still on the cloud, Dub.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.467
- Hey... can I say
something here?

09:53.567 --> 09:54.233
- Please.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.433
- Say what?

09:55.533 --> 09:58.733
- Okay, we all want to
go see the fireworks...

09:58.833 --> 10:00.800
- And we want to
go squid fishing!

10:00.900 --> 10:02.367
- Did you just interrupt me?!?

10:02.467 --> 10:03.900
- I'm sorry.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.633
- Go on Babe.

10:06.733 --> 10:08.633
- All I'm saying is we can
do both. Ya know?

10:08.733 --> 10:11.433
It's gonna take us an hour to
cruise over to the fireworks,

10:11.533 --> 10:14.633
and you guys can fish for
squid on the way there.

10:14.733 --> 10:15.733
- Sounds good to me.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.600
- Everybody wins!

10:19.800 --> 10:22.167
- Hey, what'd you say
this button's for?

10:22.267 --> 10:23.467
- Don't touch it.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.700
It's only for when the boat
sinks and I need a flo--

10:25.800 --> 10:27.367
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

10:27.467 --> 10:30.067

10:31.800 --> 10:35.300
- Kenzie blew up like
a big fat tomato!

10:51.333 --> 10:53.500
- Wait, so you and Double G
had just bought the house?

10:53.600 --> 10:56.900
- Yeah, and we were having
this huge party, and I hear

10:57.000 --> 11:02.633
this voice yelling:
"Look at me! I'm Dub-Man!"

11:05.633 --> 11:06.767
- "Dub-Man?"

11:06.867 --> 11:08.300
- Yeah, it was my dad
was on the roof,

11:08.400 --> 11:10.233
with a beach towel around
his neck like a cape,

11:10.333 --> 11:14.067
like he was some
kind of superhero.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.067
- Could someone
please deflate me?

11:17.100 --> 11:19.733
- Sshhh...
- Yeah. Hang on.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.233
- So why was Double G
on the roof?

11:22.333 --> 11:24.833
- He was gonna try to jump
thirty feet and land

11:24.933 --> 11:26.767
in the swimming pool!

11:26.867 --> 11:28.533
- Oh my God. Wait, so,
did he make it?

11:28.633 --> 11:29.700
- Oh no.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.067
- So, where did he land?

11:31.167 --> 11:33.567
- Right on top of Bunny!

11:35.667 --> 11:39.267
- It's true! I was in
the hospital for nine weeks!

11:40.500 --> 11:44.200
- Ha, ha, ha... Bunny,
get back over here!

11:46.767 --> 11:49.533
- Hey... I gotta go wazz.

11:51.833 --> 11:54.067
- Uh, what are you doing?

11:54.167 --> 11:56.200
- Tying my kite to your ankle
so it won't fly away.

11:56.300 --> 12:01.267
- Oh sure. Just use me as a kite
anchor while you go wazz.

12:01.367 --> 12:04.433
- Thanks. Back in a wazz!

12:06.100 --> 12:11.067
- Look at her. Look at her.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.767
You see that?
You see it?

12:12.867 --> 12:13.900
She over there trying to make

12:14.067 --> 12:16.300
the kids like her
better than me.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.967
Watch this. Hey, kids! Uhh...

12:19.067 --> 12:21.267
who wants to come fishing
for giant squid with me?

12:21.367 --> 12:23.133
- I don't.
- Maybe later.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.233
- Aww... Fine then!

12:25.333 --> 12:27.333
Y'all just keep going
Ah-hew-hew-hew-hew!

12:27.433 --> 12:32.067
Oh Jackie! Ahew-hew-hew-hew!
I like Jackie!

12:32.167 --> 12:33.367
Hey, come with me
to the wheelhouse.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.400
- Why are we going
to the wheelhouse?!

12:35.500 --> 12:38.367
- 'Cause we can't catch any
giant squid until we locate

12:38.467 --> 12:41.933
the squid with
the squid locator!

12:42.067 --> 12:46.267
Oh! Now that you explained it,
I understood!

12:47.300 --> 12:51.300
- I feel like a big
red marshmallow.

12:55.133 --> 12:58.867
- Boat driver, show us where
the squid locator is.

12:58.967 --> 13:01.433
- We need to locate
some squid!

13:01.533 --> 13:03.467
- It's that one, right there.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.533
- Ruthless, find us
some giant squid.

13:05.633 --> 13:07.067
- Okay!

13:10.133 --> 13:11.933
- This is a Coast Guard
advisory.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.533
Warning: all private vessels
must remain at least one mile

13:15.633 --> 13:18.233
from Fire Island until
further notice.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.867
- What's that guy
squawking about?

13:19.967 --> 13:22.100
- Oh. That's the Coast Guard,
warning all private boats

13:22.200 --> 13:23.800
to stay away from Fire Island.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.433
- Well, how come?

13:25.533 --> 13:27.833
- Because a dead mega-shark was
too heavy to move off the beach,

13:27.933 --> 13:30.067
so they're stuffing it full
of dynamite so they could

13:30.167 --> 13:31.533
blow it up!

13:31.633 --> 13:33.467
- Blow it up? Oh-ho.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.267
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
You're telling me they're going

13:35.367 --> 13:38.500
to blow up a giant mega-
shark with dynamite?!?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.700
- Yes sir.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.533
- Then, what are we doing?
Come on let's go!

13:41.633 --> 13:43.600
- Sir, it's too dangerous
for us to be in the vicinity

13:43.700 --> 13:45.367
of the shark explosion.

13:45.467 --> 13:49.500
- And, anyway, the kids all
want to go watch fireworks!

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
- A mega-shark blowing up
is way more exciting

13:51.700 --> 13:55.700
than those stupid fireworks
Jackie's taking them to see.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.533
- Okay!

13:57.633 --> 13:59.267
- Ha ha ha ha! Wooo!

13:59.367 --> 14:01.900
When the kids see that shark
blow up, they're gonna be like,

14:02.067 --> 14:06.767
"Dub! You're way more fun
than Trip's dumb old mom!"

14:06.867 --> 14:10.500
Now, step away from the wheel.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.767
- Why?

14:11.867 --> 14:14.133
- Because I'm gonna drive
this boat to Fire Island

14:14.233 --> 14:15.467
where that shark is.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.667
- Sir we're forbidden
to go there.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.767
- Hey, look at me.

14:20.867 --> 14:21.867
- Sure.

14:21.967 --> 14:24.300
- I'm the captain now.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.500
- Dub's the captain now!

14:29.567 --> 14:33.167
- So, what's the number one
craziest thing Dub ever did?

14:33.267 --> 14:34.500
- Oh that's easy.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.967
He bought property on the moon.

14:38.067 --> 14:39.667
- On the moon?

14:39.767 --> 14:42.767
- Yeah. He said he was going
to build a whole bunch

14:42.867 --> 14:44.900
of moon condos.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.900
- [over PA]
Attention! Attention!

14:49.067 --> 14:51.333
All passengers of
the Dub Boat!

14:51.433 --> 14:52.867
This is your Captain speaking.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.100
We are no longer going to see

14:56.200 --> 15:02.433
a bunch of boring old
fireworks, Jackie...

15:03.467 --> 15:05.067
- All right, what's happening?

15:05.100 --> 15:07.367
- And where's the real captain?

15:07.467 --> 15:10.500
- Sounds like Dub's
the captain now.

15:11.833 --> 15:15.333
- Ugh... I'll go find out
what this is about.

15:19.367 --> 15:22.867
- Ahhhhhh! Problem!

15:25.100 --> 15:26.533
- Babe!

15:28.233 --> 15:30.333
- Babe!

15:30.433 --> 15:32.900
- Bunny, help her!

15:33.067 --> 15:35.867
- Hang on Kenzie!

15:37.967 --> 15:39.967
- Be careful with my kite!

15:40.067 --> 15:46.800
* The Dub Boat, soon we'll be
seeing a shark explode *

15:48.067 --> 15:50.700
- Trip! Come cut the string!

15:50.800 --> 15:52.333
- Cut it with what?!?

15:52.433 --> 15:53.867
- Over there! The cheese!

15:53.967 --> 15:57.500
- How am I supposed to cut
a string with a piece of cheese?

15:57.600 --> 16:00.467
- There's a knife in the cheese.

16:00.567 --> 16:01.233
- Oh!

16:01.333 --> 16:02.733
- Come on!

16:02.833 --> 16:04.967
- Hurry up!

16:11.533 --> 16:14.367
* THE DUB BOAT!

16:14.467 --> 16:15.900
* - DUB BOAT!

16:16.067 --> 16:19.300
* - THE DUB BOAT!

16:22.933 --> 16:25.067
- My kite!

16:25.167 --> 16:27.767
Stay alive, Hank!

16:27.867 --> 16:30.267
I will find you!

16:36.733 --> 16:39.700
- We just wanted to watch
some fireworks.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.267
- Haha, well you're gonna
change your mind once you see

16:42.367 --> 16:44.800
this mega-shark blow up.

16:46.733 --> 16:48.433
- Dad, that shark's
full of dynamite.

16:48.533 --> 16:50.467
Don't you think we're
too close?

16:50.567 --> 16:54.800
- Aw son, I thought I raised you
not to be afraid of dynamite.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.300
- Hey, have you ever
seen a psychiatrist?

16:57.400 --> 16:58.533
- Ehhh... once, why?

16:58.633 --> 17:01.633
- Go get your money back!

17:01.733 --> 17:04.800
- Yes, I need to file a report.

17:04.900 --> 17:09.567
My friend is missing.
His name is Hank.

17:09.667 --> 17:12.067
- I'm really sorry
about this, kids.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.200
- No, it's not your fault.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.067
- It's kind of her fault.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.200
- Grover!

17:16.300 --> 17:18.700
- Well you married him.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.367
- Yeah. He's about
three feet tall, thin,

17:21.467 --> 17:24.533
covered in beautiful
ribbons...

17:24.633 --> 17:27.600
- Oh! Oh! It's happening!
Everyone come close!

17:27.700 --> 17:28.800
- Y'know what, Double G...

17:28.900 --> 17:30.633
- Shhh! Can't talk!

17:30.733 --> 17:33.533
- Good! 'Cuz I'm gonna talk
and you're gonna listen.

17:33.633 --> 17:35.567
Y'know, the world doesn't
revolve around you.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.733
We just wanted to have
a fun time on a boat,

17:37.833 --> 17:42.200
see some fireworks and...
are you eating Kenzie's basil?

17:42.300 --> 17:44.800
- I'm sorry!

17:44.900 --> 17:47.867
- He ate my basil?

17:47.967 --> 17:52.500
- If we can't eat the basil,
why'd she bring the basil?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.900
- He makes a good point.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.367
- I give up.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.067
- Well, I don't.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.933
Gale, I've put up with a whole
lot from you over the years...

18:01.067 --> 18:04.733
- Ooo, I'm sorry,
I don't speak monster.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.500
- All right, one more
insult out of your mouth

18:07.600 --> 18:08.733
and I swear--

18:15.400 --> 18:19.067

to kingdom come!

18:19.100 --> 18:21.233
- Hey! Everybody look out!

18:21.333 --> 18:24.400
- Shark chunks!!!

18:30.167 --> 18:32.400
- Oh! It's glorious!

18:32.500 --> 18:35.900
This makes fireworks look
like a golf tournament!

18:39.267 --> 18:40.967
- Geez, what was that?

18:42.367 --> 18:44.100
- It was the shark's head!

- Oh no!

18:53.667 --> 18:56.433
- What happened?
I didn't see what happened!

18:56.533 --> 19:00.267
- You guys, I'm on the phone.

19:00.367 --> 19:02.933
- Somebody throw him
a life preserver!

19:03.067 --> 19:06.067
- Yes ma'am!

19:08.567 --> 19:11.700
- Dang!

19:11.800 --> 19:15.200
- She meant throw it to Dub
not to New Jersey!

19:15.300 --> 19:18.067
- I'm sorry! I lost control!

19:19.700 --> 19:22.233
- Alright. That's it.

in there and save him!

wearing the poof suit!

and let Mom save you!

Double G to shut up!

19:52.567 --> 19:54.433
- SHUT UP!

- Ohhhhh. I see the confusion.
Hank is a kite.

you want to say to Jackie...
