00:03.210 --> 00:05.430
Sabrina, are you growling like a bear?

00:05.430 --> 00:07.070
I can't get this jar open.

00:07.070 --> 00:09.330
I'll do it, it's all in the wrist.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.980
Oh man, that's on tight.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.030
It looks like they're afraid the spaghetti sauce'll fall into the wrong hands.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.150
What's up?

00:17.150 --> 00:19.150
I can't get this jar open.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.540
Oh, don't you know the trick?

00:20.540 --> 00:24.940
Here, you whack it lightly to break the seal and there. uer!!

00:26.770 --> 00:28.790
See? It's not so easy.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.790
Well then, use magic.

00:30.790 --> 00:33.350
Good idea. The finger is mightier than the wrist.

00:37.060 --> 00:38.510
That should do it.

00:40.780 --> 00:43.100
what is wrong with this jar?!

00:43.100 --> 00:44.430
I give up.

00:46.070 --> 00:48.910
You know it's great having supernatural powers

00:48.910 --> 00:51.720
but for some things, we could really use a man around the house.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.830

01:17.900 --> 01:19.750
I'll be there around dinner time.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.750
Anything special you wanna do this weekend?

01:21.750 --> 01:23.560
Maybe we could go to the ice show.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.230
If that's what you want.

01:25.230 --> 01:26.720
And maybe we can invite Harvey?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.180
What a great idea.

01:28.180 --> 01:28.870
O-ho!

01:28.870 --> 01:31.380
That sounded too enthusiastic, forget I said anything.

01:31.380 --> 01:33.380
Come on, I really wanna meet him.

01:33.380 --> 01:35.230
Okay but you can't make a big deal out of it.

01:35.230 --> 01:38.930
I won't, it'll just be a casual meeting between a father

01:38.930 --> 01:41.430
and his daughters first serious boyfriend.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.160
I'm glad you understand.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.300
I gotta get to school.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.210
Bye sweetheart.

01:45.210 --> 01:46.130
See ya.

01:47.460 --> 01:48.800
Morning.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.190
You're running late.

01:50.190 --> 01:52.300
Dad and I were trying to figure out our weekend plans.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.090
D'you guys wanna go to the ice show tomorrow?

01:54.090 --> 01:55.730
Oh I don't think so.

01:55.730 --> 01:57.730
There will be little flash lights.

01:57.730 --> 01:59.070
Definitely not.

01:59.070 --> 02:01.370
Okay, then it's just me, dad and Harvey.

02:01.370 --> 02:02.970
Harvey and Ted are meeting?

02:02.970 --> 02:03.970
You didn't say that.

02:03.970 --> 02:05.610
Now that's a show worth seeing.

02:05.610 --> 02:07.310
Too bad, you already said no.

02:07.570 --> 02:08.970
That'll be fine,

02:08.970 --> 02:10.880
I'd love to meet your father.

02:11.420 --> 02:13.800
Oh man, I should have worn an under shirt.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.570
I promise you two will get along great.

02:15.570 --> 02:16.790
Does he like sports?

02:16.790 --> 02:17.490
No.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.130
Does he know anything about cars?

02:19.130 --> 02:19.740
No.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.860
Military aircraft?

02:20.860 --> 02:23.150
Look, I'm sure you'll find something to talk about.

02:23.150 --> 02:24.600
We could talk about you.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.590
No!

02:28.130 --> 02:30.000
Fine, don't say hi.

02:30.390 --> 02:32.990
Sorry Salem, I'm just so excited about seeing my dad.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.250
Has it been a month already?

02:34.250 --> 02:34.870
Yeah.

02:34.870 --> 02:36.530
But today's Tuesday right?

02:36.530 --> 02:38.020
No, Friday.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.020
Man, I was way off.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.020
Is dad here yet?

02:42.020 --> 02:42.600
No.

02:42.870 --> 02:44.120
What's going on?

02:44.120 --> 02:47.320
Hilda's still trying to open that jar of spaghetti sauce.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.660
Oh, I think I've got it this time, Watch...

02:51.680 --> 02:53.010
Don't watch.

02:53.230 --> 02:54.850
Give it up.

02:54.850 --> 02:57.440
Ted will be here soon and he'll open it.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.740
Why, because he's a man?

02:59.740 --> 03:00.640
Well yes.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.010
That is so sexist.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.040
They happen to have more upper body strength...

03:03.110 --> 03:04.330
Oh, just because he's a man...

03:04.540 --> 03:04.800
... that is not to say that...

03:04.800 --> 03:05.770
That's enough out of both of you!
... that is not to say that...

03:05.770 --> 03:06.480
... doesn't mean...
That's enough out of both of you!

03:06.480 --> 03:06.520
That's enough out of both of you!

03:06.520 --> 03:09.420
Don't make me use the voice

03:09.420 --> 03:10.480
Dad, you made it.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.560
Hi Sabrina.

03:11.970 --> 03:13.060
Hello Ted.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.260
Oh I hate that voice, it sounds just like father.

03:16.260 --> 03:19.030
I know, it's terrifying!

03:20.210 --> 03:22.370
Sometimes I even scare myself.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.040
Here, this is for you.

03:24.090 --> 03:25.080
What is it?

03:25.080 --> 03:27.380
It's a magic camera, takes photo's instantly.

03:27.380 --> 03:28.600
You mean like a Polaroid?

03:28.600 --> 03:31.200
We had the technology first. Try it.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.770
Okay, well you guys stand together.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.380
Did the flash work?

03:36.380 --> 03:37.510
Yes.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.320
almost.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.710
You've been working on that jar for two hours.

03:42.710 --> 03:43.880
See? Men aren't stronger,

03:43.880 --> 03:46.510
they just keep trying longer than any sane woman would.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.960
Ah, there.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.680
Just in time for dinner.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.220
Who wants spaghetti?

03:52.220 --> 03:54.520
Not me, I'm mad at Italian food.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.330
I don't know what I'm in the mood for.

03:57.330 --> 03:58.840
I feel like Chinese.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.680
Good idea.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.080
It's on me.

04:05.060 --> 04:06.660
It looks delicious.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.520
And smells so aromatic.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.330
Try the Peking Duck.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.840
I can't understand a word you are saying.

04:17.370 --> 04:20.279
And the Yak said 'Three days!'

04:22.500 --> 04:25.140
I'm stuffed.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.460
Who wants ice cream?

04:26.540 --> 04:28.180
I do! I do!

04:28.180 --> 04:30.840
I'll see what Salem wants.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.430
Salem, do you want ice cream?

04:34.430 --> 04:35.740
Speak English!

04:35.740 --> 04:36.700
Oh!

04:37.590 --> 04:40.060
Sorry. We're going out for ice cream, do you want some?

04:40.270 --> 04:44.160
I shouldn't, but me down for a double scoop of pralines and cream.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.350
Got it.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.350
What's that?

04:52.790 --> 04:53.650
Hello?

04:53.970 --> 04:56.110
Hi, you must be Sabrina.

04:56.110 --> 04:57.090
Who are you?

04:57.090 --> 04:59.890
I'm a friend of your fathers, my names Gail. Is he home?

04:59.890 --> 05:01.890
Yeah, hold on, I'll take you to him.

05:06.810 --> 05:08.870
Dad, someone in the book wants to talk to you.

05:08.870 --> 05:09.740
Who?

05:09.740 --> 05:11.380
I think she said her names Gail.

05:11.380 --> 05:13.380
Oh, I'll take it.

05:13.820 --> 05:15.380
Hey.

05:15.380 --> 05:18.580
Hi sweetheart, I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time?

05:18.580 --> 05:20.620
No, not at all.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.520
So what's up? I thought you were in court today?

05:23.520 --> 05:27.020
Oh I was until Drell disintegrated the judge, so we adjourned for the weekend.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.680
That's great.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.980
I was hoping maybe I could join you?

05:30.980 --> 05:32.580
Hold on, I'll check.

05:32.580 --> 05:33.760
Busted.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.540
Who's Gail?

05:34.540 --> 05:36.040
Figure four-B?

05:36.040 --> 05:38.180
Actually she's more than that.

05:38.580 --> 05:39.880
Gail is my...

05:39.880 --> 05:41.030
girlfriend.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.820
You have a girlfriend! since when?

05:42.970 --> 05:45.140
We've been seeing each other for about ten months.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.990
Does mom know about this?

05:47.380 --> 05:48.210
Honey,

05:48.470 --> 05:51.160
your mom and I have been divorced for six years.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.700
It has not been six years,

05:52.700 --> 05:55.660
I was ten when you got divorced, I'm sixteen now, that would make it...

05:56.420 --> 05:57.660
Six years.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.840
So would you like to meet her?

05:59.840 --> 06:00.480
I would.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.630
Me too.

06:01.630 --> 06:02.670
Sure, why not.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.340
Great, you're going to really like her.

06:04.340 --> 06:08.150
I've been waiting for just the right time to bring her around

06:08.150 --> 06:09.940
and well, I guess this is it.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.040
Come on out honey.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.360
Stand back.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.710
Those margins are tight.

06:18.510 --> 06:22.790
Gail, this is Hilda, Zelda and my Sabrina.

06:23.170 --> 06:27.740
It's so good to finally meet everyone, I've heard so much about you.

06:27.740 --> 06:30.940
Well we've heard nothing about you, so we'll ask all the questions.

06:32.030 --> 06:33.150
Smile.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.000
Whoa! I think I blinked.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.460
I think the whole block blinked.

06:37.580 --> 06:38.730
It's a good one of you Ted.

06:38.730 --> 06:39.930
Let me see.

06:42.430 --> 06:45.270
Wow, can't remember the last time I pinged in a photo.

06:46.490 --> 06:50.320
So Gail, you were just about to tell us how you and Ted met.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.350
Actually it's very funny.

06:52.350 --> 06:55.590
See, every year the book has a blood drive.

06:55.590 --> 07:00.140
Well I always give because I'm E negative, which is kind of rare.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.870
So, just as the nurse sticks me she points to Ted on the next cot

07:03.870 --> 07:05.720
and tells me he's E negative too.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.580
Well, I just couldn't resist turning to him and blurting out...

07:09.580 --> 07:11.580
I got an 'A' in my history test.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.100
That's great Sabrina.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.800
Yes, it's wonderful but...

07:16.800 --> 07:18.800
I want to hear the rest of Gail's story.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.440
Oh, sorry.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.230
That's okay.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.970
So what did you say?

07:22.970 --> 07:25.550
I said, 'I guess you're my type.'

07:27.890 --> 07:29.750
Because of the E negative thing.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.750
Oh right! Blood.

07:32.330 --> 07:33.880
Very clever.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.470
Oh look, here's our ice cream.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.790
Did you ever notice how these sundae's have strata?

07:38.310 --> 07:40.570
They do, see there's a layer of hot fudge,

07:40.570 --> 07:43.050
a layer of ice cream and then more hot fudge.

07:43.050 --> 07:46.550
I guess 'cause mom's an archaeologist I notice stuff like that.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.650
That's fascinating.

07:49.650 --> 07:50.790
And delicious.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.380
Well that looks incredible.

07:52.380 --> 07:53.550
Oh, d'you wanna bite?

07:53.550 --> 07:55.670
Oh well, maybe just a taste.

07:55.670 --> 07:56.970
Here, have some.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.540
That's enough!

07:58.820 --> 08:01.090
Sabrina, we're sharing.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.850
She has coffee.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.970
I think there's plenty for all of us.

08:04.970 --> 08:06.350
No there's not.

08:06.550 --> 08:09.330
I mean maybe there's enough ice cream and maybe there's enough whipped cream

08:09.330 --> 08:11.650
but there's only two layers of hot fudge and that is not enough.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.880
Then I'll tell you what.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.210
We'll get you your own.

08:15.210 --> 08:16.880
Oh no, he's gonna use the voice.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.840
I don't want my own.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.350
Sabrina, I didn't come here to steal you hot fudge, really,

08:21.350 --> 08:22.540
I only wanted a bite.

08:22.890 --> 08:24.150
Just a bite?

08:24.150 --> 08:25.260
Yes.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.800
Oh well, that's okay.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.430
Do you want the cherry, I don't like em.

08:31.930 --> 08:35.350
And the monster fun weekend continues. Who's up for charades?

08:35.350 --> 08:37.650
I am, as long as I'm not on Hilda's team.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.570
Same here.

08:38.570 --> 08:41.110
Well I'll be on your team Hilda, and Sabrina?

08:41.470 --> 08:42.610
I'll pass.

08:42.610 --> 08:44.620
I'm just going to bring Salem his ice cream

08:44.620 --> 08:46.410
and then I've gotta do some homework.

08:46.410 --> 08:47.590
It's Friday night.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.730
You know kids, we love our homework.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.320
Gotta go.

08:51.970 --> 08:53.900
She's taking this hard.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.900
And covering so well.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.570
Maybe I should go.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.100
No, I'll just go have a talk with her.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.100
Here cat, pig out.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.000
Hey, you have to open the bag, I can't...

09:05.410 --> 09:07.880
Oh Ted, fantastic. Listen, could you...

09:07.880 --> 09:08.960
Not now, Salem.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.200
Sabrina, I think we need to talk.

09:16.200 --> 09:16.980
About what?

09:16.980 --> 09:18.980
Your problem with Gail.

09:18.980 --> 09:20.650
I don't have a problem with Gail.

09:20.790 --> 09:23.030
Then she can come with us to the ice show tomorrow?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.320
Absolutely not!

09:24.320 --> 09:26.730
See? There is a problem.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.180
Honey,

09:28.490 --> 09:32.060
I know it's hard for you to accept a new woman in my life

09:32.690 --> 09:34.510
but I have to move on.

09:34.850 --> 09:36.510
We all have to move on.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.870
Okay, but before you do,

09:38.870 --> 09:41.470
just remember mom'll be getting her Ph.D soon and

09:41.470 --> 09:45.140
maybe the two of you could get teaching jobs together at a small collage near a big City,

09:45.140 --> 09:47.090
Villa Nova would be perfect.

09:47.210 --> 09:48.900
That's a very sweet,

09:49.080 --> 09:50.610
detailed thought,

09:51.160 --> 09:52.610
that's not gonna happen.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.860
How about Miami of Ohio?

09:55.200 --> 10:00.060
No. Now I want you to do me a favour and come down stairs and give Gail a chance.

10:00.060 --> 10:00.930
Can you do that?

10:03.180 --> 10:06.220
Okay, but only because I'm a really big person.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.770
Oh great, and you can be on aunt Hilda's team for Charades.

10:09.770 --> 10:10.960
Noooo!

10:12.110 --> 10:14.120
Oh this is good.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.810
This is so good.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.750
I mean did powdered wigs look good on anyone?

10:19.750 --> 10:20.650
We're back.

10:20.650 --> 10:22.780
Just in time, here's Ted in a kilt.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.390
Put the photo album down!

10:28.790 --> 10:31.030
Now, let's all sit and chat.

10:31.390 --> 10:32.590
About what?

10:32.920 --> 10:35.480
Well actually I'd like to hear more about you, Gail.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.500
You would?

10:36.500 --> 10:37.440
Yeah.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.100
What do you wanna know?

10:39.260 --> 10:42.830
I wasn't really paying attention before so

10:43.210 --> 10:45.950
let's start at the beginning, erm. You're a lawyer right?

10:45.950 --> 10:46.870
Right.

10:46.870 --> 10:49.160
And you and my dad have been going out how long?

10:49.160 --> 10:50.330
About a year.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.180
So d'you think you'll get married?

10:52.180 --> 10:52.470
-No.

10:52.470 --> 10:53.120
-Yes. Did you say no?
-No.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.440
-Yes. Did you say no?

10:55.690 --> 10:57.440
Yes. Didn't you?

10:57.440 --> 10:57.990
No.

10:57.990 --> 10:58.700
You said yes?

10:58.700 --> 10:59.330
Yes.

10:59.340 --> 10:59.990
When I said no?

10:59.990 --> 11:00.290
Yes.

11:00.290 --> 11:01.070
That's not good.

11:01.070 --> 11:01.580
No.

11:01.580 --> 11:02.340
Are you upset?

11:02.340 --> 11:02.880
Yes.

11:02.880 --> 11:03.830
Would you like to talk?

11:03.830 --> 11:04.290
No.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.050
I think we should.

11:05.050 --> 11:06.230
Yes.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.310
Okay, I know we've never discussed this

11:10.310 --> 11:12.610
but I thought marriage was where we were heading.

11:12.610 --> 11:15.210
Not me. Gail, you know I've done the marriage thing.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.820
Well I haven't and I'd like to.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.510
What are you doing?

11:19.510 --> 11:20.790
Just looking for a page.

11:20.790 --> 11:24.170
I think I need some time to re-evaluate everything we've ever said to each other.

11:24.170 --> 11:25.390
Good bye.

11:27.450 --> 11:28.440
What do I do?

11:28.440 --> 11:29.390
Go after her.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.450
Quickly.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.360
She wants to be alone.

11:39.720 --> 11:40.580
So,

11:41.970 --> 11:43.450
who's up for charades?

11:48.010 --> 11:50.300
What smells so funny?

11:50.300 --> 11:52.280
Your dad was up a lot last night

11:52.280 --> 11:55.900
and I guess he thought he'd be helpful by opening every jar in the house.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.960
Would you like sweet gerkins for breakfast?

11:57.960 --> 11:58.950
Not really.

11:59.030 --> 12:00.700
So is dad still sleeping?

12:00.760 --> 12:01.380
Nope.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.380
Not now; Not ever.

12:03.650 --> 12:06.170
Dad, what about the ice show, you're not dressed.

12:06.170 --> 12:07.260
Isn't it casual?

12:07.260 --> 12:08.310
Not that casual.

12:08.490 --> 12:10.310
No problem, I'll change.

12:10.780 --> 12:12.730
Quickly, Harvey's here.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.860
Hey.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.780
Hi.

12:16.780 --> 12:18.780
Wow, you got all dressed up.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.930
I wanted to make a good impression on your dad.

12:21.930 --> 12:23.080
Is it too much?

12:23.080 --> 12:25.690
Well he may ask you to do his taxes.

12:25.690 --> 12:27.560
Did you put stuff in your hair?

12:27.560 --> 12:28.740
No!...

12:28.950 --> 12:30.190
Yes.

12:30.190 --> 12:31.760
You must be Harvey.

12:31.760 --> 12:32.780
I must.

12:32.780 --> 12:34.070
This is my dad.

12:34.070 --> 12:35.240
Nice to meet you.

12:35.330 --> 12:36.970
Nice to meet you.

12:37.410 --> 12:40.450
Oh I forgot my camera, I'll be right back.

12:40.450 --> 12:42.410
You guys get to know each other.

12:53.430 --> 12:54.680
All set?

12:54.680 --> 12:55.130
-Yeah.

12:55.130 --> 12:56.030
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

12:56.030 --> 12:56.270
-Let's go.

12:56.270 --> 12:59.090
Hey if we have time maybe we could stop by the arcade.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.590
These little flash lights were more fun when I was five.

13:52.730 --> 13:54.770
Wow, Katarina Witt is really beautiful.

13:54.770 --> 13:56.300
You think so?

13:58.800 --> 14:00.540
Ooh! that had to hurt.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.540
This is fun.

14:02.790 --> 14:05.020
I don't think your dad's having too good a time.

14:05.020 --> 14:05.810
What d'ya mean?

14:05.810 --> 14:07.380
Well he sunk all those baskets

14:07.380 --> 14:09.010
and it was like it meant nothing to him.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.610
No, I think he just didn't want to rub our noses in it.

14:11.610 --> 14:14.210
At least he hasn't tried to have a man to man talk with me.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.210
Hey guys.

14:16.210 --> 14:17.430
That was quick.

14:17.430 --> 14:21.460
The line for sodas was really long so I got us carrot juices instead

14:21.460 --> 14:23.460
and little boxes of raisins.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.540
Yum, yum. I'll be back with somethin' to eat.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.580
So Harvey,

14:31.890 --> 14:33.580
how's life?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.190
Fine, thanks for asking.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.660
You mind if we have a talk,

14:38.660 --> 14:40.390
man to man?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.500
...No?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.620
Okay,

14:44.270 --> 14:45.960
here's the question.

14:46.870 --> 14:48.660
If you love a woman,

14:48.880 --> 14:50.660
d'you think you ought to marry her?

14:51.220 --> 14:52.320
Well I....

14:52.320 --> 14:55.820
Sure there are a million reasons not to but are any of them any good?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.570
A few might be.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.660
But how do you know when you're ready?

14:59.660 --> 15:00.990
Maybe you never know,

15:00.990 --> 15:03.890
maybe one day you just have to take that leap.

15:03.890 --> 15:06.190
Sir, I'm only sixteen!

15:08.620 --> 15:11.280
Mmm, chutney, olive, peanut butter casserole.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.880
Oh, the pickled beets look great on top.

15:13.880 --> 15:14.830
They're home.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.630
Hi, did you have fun?

15:16.630 --> 15:17.880
We had a blast.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.490
Sauerkraut dandy?

15:19.490 --> 15:20.630
Thanks.

15:20.950 --> 15:23.530
Hey, d'ya know what I feel like doing now?

15:23.920 --> 15:25.530
Playing solitaire.

15:27.770 --> 15:29.670
We have to talk, upstairs.

15:29.670 --> 15:30.380
Okay.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.380
Are we in trouble?

15:32.380 --> 15:33.640
What's going on?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.620
I'm worried about dad,

15:36.620 --> 15:38.690
I don't think he enjoyed the ice show.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.160
I'm sure he had a fine time.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.710
No, he got really hostile.

15:42.710 --> 15:45.910
He even threw his souvenir Scott Hamilton cup at Scott Hamilton.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.020
Did he get him?

15:47.020 --> 15:48.460
That's not the point,

15:48.460 --> 15:51.090
I think dad might be a little depressed. Look at this.

15:52.370 --> 15:54.110
Oh, that's ketchup, not blood.

15:54.110 --> 15:57.550
Anyway, I have an idea. I think I know how to make everything right.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.860
Five hundred channels of mindless entertainment,

16:00.860 --> 16:01.390
he'll love it.

16:01.390 --> 16:05.370
Sabrina, I don't think pay per view is what will make your father happy.

16:05.370 --> 16:08.210
I think the problem is he misses Gail.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.610
He didn't mention her all day.

16:09.610 --> 16:12.140
He didn't have to, this says it all.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.880
See? His smiles more of a pain than a ping.

16:15.270 --> 16:19.020
I can't stand to see him miserable, I've gotta do something.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.630
Honey, maybe you've done enough.

16:20.630 --> 16:21.700
I'm gonna go talk to Gail.

16:21.700 --> 16:22.570
Do you think that's wise?

16:22.570 --> 16:23.870
I'll let you know when I get back.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.230
Hello?

16:29.600 --> 16:31.230
Anyone?

16:35.070 --> 16:36.340
May I help you?

16:36.340 --> 16:38.330
I need to find someone but I don't know where they are.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.790
Then you've come to the right place, this is the index and I am the index keeper.

16:41.790 --> 16:44.090
Walker comma James T at your service and you are.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.730
Hm, last name first.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.570
Spellman comma Sabrina J?

16:47.570 --> 16:49.570
Pleased to meet you. Now who are you looking for.

16:49.570 --> 16:50.180
Her name is Gail.

16:50.180 --> 16:51.020
Last name first!

16:51.020 --> 16:52.240
I don't know her last name.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.650
Cross reference.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.650
Do you know anything else about her?

16:55.650 --> 16:56.740
She's a lawyer.

16:56.870 --> 17:01.540
There are one thousand three hundred and thirty two lawyers named Gail. You can start with Aardvark comma Gail Q.

17:01.540 --> 17:03.540
I don't have time to go through a thousand Gail's.

17:03.540 --> 17:04.800
Then I need more information.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.800
I know she likes hot fudge.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.650
We don't keep data on ice cream topping preferences.

17:09.650 --> 17:10.859
What do you keep data on?

17:10.859 --> 17:15.140
Shoe size, neck size, birth date, last book read, blood type, skin Ph, fatal flaw...

17:15.140 --> 17:18.040
Wait! I know her blood type, it's um E negative.

17:18.210 --> 17:19.380
A rare one.

17:20.869 --> 17:22.510
that cuts down to two.

17:22.510 --> 17:24.890
Boulder comma Gail and Kipling comma Gail.

17:25.020 --> 17:27.990
Well I'm in kind of a hurry, is there anything else you can tell me about them?

17:30.690 --> 17:34.160
Technically, I'm not supposed to say this but er,

17:34.160 --> 17:37.230
one of these Gail's has an extremely high skin Ph.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.230
Is your Gail scaly?

17:39.230 --> 17:40.100
No.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.000
Then I'd go with Kipling comma Gail. Page eight seventy-five.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.300
Great, how do I get there?

17:44.300 --> 17:45.160
Tube lift.

17:45.910 --> 17:48.180
This will send you directly to your page.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.920
Bend your knees.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.740
Now where in the Hill comma Sam did I leave my keys?

18:06.720 --> 18:07.770
Who is it?

18:07.770 --> 18:09.640
Sabrina, can we talk?

18:09.990 --> 18:11.500
Now is not a good time,

18:11.500 --> 18:15.100
I'm very busy exploring the profit potential of Drell suing himself.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.020
I'll be quick,

18:16.020 --> 18:17.980
I just came to tell you how much my dad misses you.

18:17.980 --> 18:21.030
Duly noted. Now if you don't mind I'm working.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.640
But you can't just stop seeing him.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.940
I'm sorry, I can't think about Ted

18:24.940 --> 18:27.840
or anything else until I get these papers off my desk.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.650
Then let me help you.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.120
What do you think you're doing!

18:33.120 --> 18:35.120
Your desk is clear, now can we talk?

18:35.120 --> 18:37.120
You've got five minutes.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.770
Good, I'll take them over here.

18:38.770 --> 18:41.320
Look, I don't know much about adult relationships

18:41.320 --> 18:42.870
but I know you're making a big mistake.

18:43.310 --> 18:44.870
Oh really?

18:44.870 --> 18:46.960
Yeah, my dad's the coolest.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.220
I mean he's fun and thoughtful and kind,

18:49.330 --> 18:51.720
and if there's a good movie on he'll let you stay up late.

18:51.870 --> 18:54.240
I'm well aware of your father's good points,

18:54.240 --> 18:57.360
that's why I said yes when you asked if I thought we'd get married.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.320
So what's the problem?

18:58.320 --> 18:59.530
He said no.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.250
He just needs time.

19:01.470 --> 19:03.710
The divorce was really hard on him and my mom,

19:03.710 --> 19:05.940
they thought their marriage was gonna last for ever,

19:06.130 --> 19:08.470
not twelve years which is a lot shorter.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.650
So now he's a little freaked out

19:11.650 --> 19:13.300
but just be patient.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.300
I keep telling him he has to move on.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.640
We all have to move on.

19:19.110 --> 19:21.450
How much time do you think he'll need?

19:21.450 --> 19:22.850
Well it's hard to say

19:22.940 --> 19:26.040
but the question you have to ask yourself is not do you want to get married

19:26.040 --> 19:27.800
but do you love my dad?

19:28.140 --> 19:29.340
I do.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.760
Then you should be together, it's as simple as that.

19:32.020 --> 19:35.470
You know that love between two people is stronger than any legal document.

19:35.470 --> 19:36.720
Yes,

19:36.720 --> 19:39.040
but as a lawyer I'm not supposed to admit it.

19:42.470 --> 19:45.100
Dad, someone's here to see you.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.100
Do they have a three of clubs?

19:50.830 --> 19:53.100
I'll leave you two alone.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.490
Okay, we're down to the last three jars.

19:59.620 --> 20:00.660
I'll eat the fluff,

20:00.660 --> 20:01.890
you eat the marmalade,

20:01.890 --> 20:03.240
we'll split the capers.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.170
Deal.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.880
Gail's back.

20:06.880 --> 20:07.330
She is?

20:07.330 --> 20:08.140
That's wonderful.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.220
Yeah, I'm so happy for dad.

20:10.220 --> 20:11.940
I'm really, really happy for dad,

20:12.880 --> 20:14.410
but what about mom?

20:14.540 --> 20:17.180
Why don't you call her in Peru, see how she's doing?

20:17.180 --> 20:19.960
I talked to her yesterday, I just wish I could see her.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.560
You could with the magic sneak-a-peek.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.380
What's that?

20:23.380 --> 20:25.280
It's a very powerful magnifier,

20:25.280 --> 20:27.780
that allows you to key into anyone on the planet.

20:27.780 --> 20:28.960
Isn't that like eaves dropping?

20:28.960 --> 20:31.450
Yes, but the pictures too fuzzy to make anybody uncomfortable.

20:31.450 --> 20:33.590
Just hold it up to the map in your magic book

20:33.590 --> 20:34.560
and you'll see your mom.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.910
Cool, thanks.

20:35.910 --> 20:37.360
You're welcome.

20:37.810 --> 20:39.040
That'll make her feel better.

20:39.120 --> 20:39.790
Yeah.

20:40.150 --> 20:43.620
You know it's crazy but this is really hitting the spot.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.230
What are you doin'?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.230
Taking a peek at my mom.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.680
I see her, there she is!

20:56.900 --> 20:59.310
I guess I don't have to worry about mom anymore.

20:59.310 --> 21:00.210
She's happy?

21:00.210 --> 21:02.330
Yeah, she loves her work..

21:02.330 --> 21:04.540
and her colleague is really cute.

21:04.540 --> 21:06.880
So I'm pleased to say everyone's moved on.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.560
Not me, I'm stayin' put.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.870
There's an exciting shaft of light on the ceiling

21:10.870 --> 21:12.960
that'll keep me here for the next five hours.

21:13.170 --> 21:15.980
So there is. Well enjoy it Salem,

21:15.980 --> 21:17.340
you deserve it.

21:18.350 --> 21:20.070
Hey, I pinged!

21:24.060 --> 21:25.640
Go get em.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.940
I still don't see why I had to be on aunt Hilda's team.

21:29.610 --> 21:30.410
Ready?

21:32.450 --> 21:33.740
It's a play.

21:34.170 --> 21:35.740
Fifty-one word!

21:36.750 --> 21:38.070
Six words.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.620
First word.

21:40.620 --> 21:41.620
Sounds like.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.270
Air traffic controller.

21:45.490 --> 21:47.340
Smiling air traffic controller.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.340
I can't think of anything else.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.370
Oh, cat on a hot tin roof.

21:53.730 --> 21:54.670
Yes!

21:55.305 --> 22:01.522
