I wanna look like
Tiffany Pollard.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.052
I love her nose.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.141
I have no clue
what the doctor did here.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.664
I just think my nose look
like a chicken butt.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.057
I don't know what
a chicken butt looks like.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.493
I know what a chicken butt
looks like.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.495
Britney Spears is one
of my biggest inspirations.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.150
She has very significant
animation deformity

00:20.194 --> 00:22.022
that could occur
when you're undergoing

00:22.065 --> 00:24.241
the male to female transition.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.212
I hit my left knee
on a rock ledge.

00:38.255 --> 00:41.432
My knee looks very disfigured.

00:41.476 --> 00:45.175
This is absolute
medical negligence.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.872
This is not something
that I wanna deal with

00:46.916 --> 00:48.309

00:48.352 --> 00:49.832
We're racing against the clock.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.313
- We only have about 2 hours...

00:52.356 --> 00:55.185

When I was growing up
in the early 2000s,

01:30.786 --> 01:33.441
Britney Spears, Paris Hilton,
Lindsay Lohan

01:33.484 --> 01:36.835
were the Hollywood "it" girls,
and I wanted to be

01:36.879 --> 01:38.750
my very own "it" girl.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.101
I'm obsessed
with the early 2000s.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.712
Crop top, short skirts,

01:43.755 --> 01:46.584
and my all-time favorite--
velour tracksuit.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.634

Listening to Britney Spears
as a little child

01:56.116 --> 01:58.596
before I became
my authentic self,

01:58.640 --> 02:00.076
Britney was one
of my biggest inspirations

02:00.120 --> 02:01.556
to be a singer.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.471
Now I'm on fire.

02:03.514 --> 02:06.430
Then at 16 years old,
I decided to transition

02:06.474 --> 02:10.521
to a woman by taking
Hormone Replacement Therapy.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.044
Hormones can make you
look more feminine,

02:12.088 --> 02:14.873
but they can't do everything
that plastic surgery

02:14.917 --> 02:16.658
can do for you.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.182
I've had one
breast augmentation,

02:19.226 --> 02:20.966
a rhinoplasty,
fillers in my cheeks,

02:21.010 --> 02:26.015
fillers in my chin,
fillers in my...lips.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.626
It's hard to keep track.
Botox.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.238
I've poked a needle just
about anywhere you can.

02:31.281 --> 02:34.632
But right now my breasts look
too natural,

02:34.676 --> 02:37.461
and my breast tissue
separates from my implant.

02:37.505 --> 02:41.813
When I flex my muscle,
you see here's the implant,

02:41.857 --> 02:43.598
and here's the breast.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.818
And I want them bigger.
I want everybody to see them.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.691
My personality is exaggerated.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.345
I just need the body
to match it.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.925
I'm Cadine. I'm 38 years old.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.232
This great, mon. Hey!

03:09.276 --> 03:11.539
I'm from Jamaica,
and my whole nose--

03:11.582 --> 03:13.889
This Jamaican me crazy. Look.
It's terrible.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.848
After having three surgeries,
I have a scar on my nose,

03:16.892 --> 03:20.809
and it has this "V" shape,
this ugly thing just hanging.

03:20.852 --> 03:21.897
People that say,
"What wrong with you?"

03:21.940 --> 03:25.117
"Don't worry about it.
Me got it."

03:25.161 --> 03:27.207
Oh, my goodness, Ma. It's such
a beautiful day, isn't it?

03:27.250 --> 03:29.731
I always hated my nose
growing up.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.863
It was so big.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.997
Growing up in Jamaica, we do not
talk about plastic surgery ever.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.652
But watching TV, I was like,
oh, my God. I want that.

03:37.695 --> 03:41.264
You know I didn't want you to go
through all of that trauma.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.876
In Jamaica, we believe it is
natural to be how God made it.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.183
I know that, Ma, but sometimes
in life, you know,

03:47.227 --> 03:49.533
we think that we're not
beautiful

03:49.577 --> 03:51.709
or we want something
to tweak about us.

03:51.753 --> 03:52.754
Why not try?

03:52.797 --> 03:54.712
Having three surgeries
on my nose

03:54.756 --> 03:56.366
impact me and my mom's
relationship.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.803
It really has, you know,
broken us a little bit.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.370
You know, she told me so,
she told me so

04:00.414 --> 04:03.373
not to touch myself,
and I didn't listen,

04:03.417 --> 04:04.940
and I went back,
and it got worse,

04:04.983 --> 04:07.159
and then going back
the third time,

04:07.203 --> 04:10.380
she was so mad and devastated
because I didn't listen to her.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.773
I'm gonna fix this, you know,

04:11.816 --> 04:14.384
so I can have this smile
once again

04:14.428 --> 04:16.256
and feel confident, you know?

04:16.299 --> 04:18.475
My nose is a hot mess.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.087
Like, I have to put extra makeup
to hide my scar,

04:22.131 --> 04:25.482
and I just kind of use my hair
to cover my face

04:25.526 --> 04:26.744
every day, all day.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.746
So I call my hair Lucy
because, you know,

04:28.790 --> 04:30.574
it's so loose and flowy,
and I just, like,

04:30.618 --> 04:32.054
always play with her.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.839
She's always the one helping me
to hide this.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.320
Lucy and I, we're friends.
I love her.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
I know in my heart that,
you know,

04:39.453 --> 04:40.367
I made the wrong decision.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.412
I feel unhappy.

04:42.456 --> 04:47.548
I don't wanna cry. I'm sorry.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.898
Because you have done
three surgery on your body,

04:49.941 --> 04:52.335
as a mother, I'm very scared,
and I am concerned

04:52.379 --> 04:55.295
about what will happen
for this journey.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.780
I just started again,
since you're the one

05:02.824 --> 05:04.608
who taught me about this...
- Fasting?

05:04.652 --> 05:06.958
I just started fasting again,
and I've already lost

05:07.002 --> 05:08.786
in one day, 3 pounds.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.702
But you're gonna drink like a...
Oh.

05:11.746 --> 05:15.358
I'm a little concerned
about this giant water bottle.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.968
Every 10 minutes,
I'll be peeing.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.406
- Is that a gallon?
- I don't know.

05:19.449 --> 05:22.800
Giant water bottle means
giant bladder

05:22.844 --> 05:29.111
having to pass through
that not-so-giant penis.

05:33.507 --> 05:34.725
- What do you got?
- This is Cadine.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.641
Oh! I have no clue
what the doctor did here.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.209
If I try to fix that scar,
I'm gonna destroy her nose.

05:40.252 --> 05:43.168
Forget the scar. How you gonna
give this nose any shape?

05:43.212 --> 05:46.824
Can you please send in Cadine?

05:46.868 --> 05:48.870
- There she is.
- Wow, look at that hair.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.350
- Cadine.
- Good morning, Dr. Nassif.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.829
- Nice to meet you.
- It's really nice to meet you.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.091
- How are you?
- Hi, Cadine. Nice to meet you.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.224
- Is this your mom?
- Yes. Nice to meet you.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.356
- How are you?
- Sonia.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.487
- Sonia.
- Sonia, nice to meet you.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.662
- Dr. Dubrow.
- Same here.

05:58.706 --> 05:59.620
Dr. Dubrow.
Pleasure to meet you.

05:59.663 --> 06:00.664
- Same here.
- Welcome.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.363
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.755
Look at that hair. Wow!

06:04.799 --> 06:06.104
- I love it.
- Thank you.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.542
Well, I can only see
half of your face, though.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.674
Because of my nose,
I hide it all the time.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.502
Wow.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.025
- There you go.
- Sorry.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.287
So... Jamaican?

06:15.331 --> 06:16.376
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

06:16.419 --> 06:17.855
So let me ask you a question.

06:17.899 --> 06:18.987
Are there plastic surgeons
in Jamaica?

06:19.030 --> 06:20.467
- No.
- Do a lot of Jamaican women

06:20.510 --> 06:22.033
have plastic surgery
at some point?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.295
No.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.472
So that really makes
the story interesting.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.039
So tell us about your nose.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.782
So 2018, April, my friend told
me about this doctor in Florida.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.394
Was it a Board-certified
plastic surgeon?

06:34.437 --> 06:35.873
- Not certified.
- Not Board-certified.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.919
- So it was a cosmetic surgeon.
- Yes.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.138
To call yourself
a cosmetic surgeon,

06:40.182 --> 06:43.925
obviously, you should have
a medical license,

06:43.968 --> 06:45.535
I would assume,
but nowadays,

06:45.579 --> 06:47.319
you never know
what you're gonna find.

06:47.363 --> 06:51.280
I told him that I wanted to have
this part to be more narrow

06:51.323 --> 06:53.238
and my nostril to be smaller.

06:53.282 --> 06:56.503
So basically, what he was
gonna do is to lift it

06:56.546 --> 06:58.156
and then do the nostrils.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.290
So I had my first surgery
with my nose,

07:01.333 --> 07:02.509
and couple days later, I said,

07:02.552 --> 07:04.380
let me just take off
the plastic tape.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.860
Plastic tape?

07:05.903 --> 07:07.601
You mean like when you put on
an IV, that kind of tape?

07:07.644 --> 07:09.037
- Yes. I took--
- That's not the typical tape

07:09.080 --> 07:10.908
we use on the nose.
- I took it off,

07:10.952 --> 07:13.563
and the nostril is so uneven,
so wide,

07:13.607 --> 07:14.999
and all my skin was gone.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.740
Oh, Jesus.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.002
That's why you have the scar.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.440
He says, "Okay, when it's
healed completely,

07:20.483 --> 07:22.659
I'll cut it out--the scar."

07:22.703 --> 07:26.533
So second surgery, 2019,
he cuts this.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.795
The doctor just kinda, like,
cuts skin and...

07:27.838 --> 07:29.927
Yes, and suture it together.

07:29.971 --> 07:32.190
And then that's why I have
this long cut on my face.

07:32.234 --> 07:35.237
That was on me,
like an idiot thinking

07:35.280 --> 07:36.586
that I can trust him enough
to fix this completely.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.109
But it wasn't on you.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.981
I know you're blaming yourself
for that a little bit.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.504
- All the time.
- Yeah, don't.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.725
My third surgery,
he decided to go

07:44.768 --> 07:46.204
and take the cartilage
behind my ears and put in,

07:46.248 --> 07:48.729
and that's how I have
this ugly drop.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.775
What was the goal of putting
ear cartilage in the nose?

07:51.819 --> 07:53.690
- To make it more projecting?
- Yes.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.387
- When was that surgery?
- That was last year.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.955
It wasn't a plastic surgeon.
Who would attempt ear cartilage?

07:57.999 --> 07:59.261
I mean, it'd be interesting
to find out...

07:59.304 --> 08:00.480
- This guy has got...
- ...what type of doctor

08:00.523 --> 08:01.872
this guy really was.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.527
This guy is Jamaican me crazy.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.702
Well, yes.
Really crazy.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.095
Was that a nice joke
he just said?

08:07.138 --> 08:09.314
- Yeah, mon. Yeah, mon.
- Yeah, mon, Yeah, mon.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.099
How many times have you heard
that joke in your life?

08:11.142 --> 08:12.535
- All the time.
- All the time.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.973
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow,
I say...

08:16.017 --> 08:18.149
Me say I...

08:18.193 --> 08:20.021
So, Mom, would you agree

08:20.064 --> 08:21.979
with her having plastic surgery
right now?

08:22.023 --> 08:23.590
- Or you would leave it alone?
- I would leave it alone.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.808
- You would?
- Yeah.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.157
What do you think about that?

08:26.201 --> 08:28.464
I think my mom need glasses.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.335
Mom, you're Jamaican her crazy.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.644
I just think my nose
look like a chicken butt.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.863
I don't know what a chicken butt
looks like.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.169
I know what a chicken butt
looks like.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.258
I remember when I was a kid.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.173
And I'm eating this chicken,
really getting into it,

08:42.217 --> 08:44.480
and my older brother
says to me,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.177
"You know that's the butt
of the chicken."

08:47.701 --> 08:49.659
Right? And ever since then,
I've been acutely aware

08:49.703 --> 08:52.009
of chicken butts.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.794
Is there a celebrity who you
think has a nice nose

08:53.837 --> 08:55.056
that you'd like to have?

08:55.099 --> 08:56.536
Tiffany Pollard.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.538
- Mm.
- He did her nose.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.843
- I know.
- Ohh.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.846
She had her nostrils
made smaller,

09:02.890 --> 09:05.719
and the tip pushed down.
- I love her nose.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.677
That was perfect.
I wanna look like her.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.811
Cadine, you have a lot of issues
going on,

09:10.854 --> 09:12.943
and until I get
inside the nose,

09:12.987 --> 09:14.641
it's a little bit worrisome.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.733
Feels like there's no support
at all.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.212
What percentage
is gonna make you happy

09:21.256 --> 09:24.302
of fixing your nose?
- 80 or 90%.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.653
That's kind of a high number.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.829
I am tired of people looking
at my knee.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.353
It's just disfigured.

09:31.396 --> 09:35.836
You have checked every disaster
you can possibly check.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.535
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

09:39.579 --> 09:41.711
All right, let's take a peek
at your nose.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.366
When you say chicken butt,
what--show us.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.367
What are you talking about?

09:45.410 --> 09:47.456
So when I hold my face down,

09:47.499 --> 09:48.675
basically,
this piece is hanging.

09:48.718 --> 09:49.893
That's how the chicken butt
looks.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.112
That's right. That is--
I see it.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.592
So the chicken butt's

09:52.635 --> 09:53.418
that little round thing
at the end of the chicken.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.855
- Yes.
- Now I get it.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.073
The only thing you can say
about that, really, is...

09:58.467 --> 10:00.077
- It feels like there's...
- No support.

10:00.121 --> 10:03.298
...no support at all. That skin
is atrophic. It's very thin.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.169
And the nostrils are asymmetric.

10:05.213 --> 10:09.957
So with the combination of
elevating the tip of your nose,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.785
bringing the bones in,

10:11.828 --> 10:13.395
bringing both nostrils in

10:13.438 --> 10:15.049
by cutting on the sides
and inside,

10:15.092 --> 10:18.835
building out this possibly here
to give you more projection,

10:18.879 --> 10:20.837
I'm gonna need to use
some of your rib cartilage.

10:20.881 --> 10:24.449
But I'm not gonna be able
to remove the scar,

10:24.493 --> 10:26.495
because your skin's been
destroyed in the past.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.757
Okay.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.716
The problem with operating on
scar tissue

10:29.759 --> 10:33.284
is that when you actually put
a knife through it with scalpel,

10:33.328 --> 10:34.590
the scar tissue can grow back.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.331
You can't control scar tissue.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.681
What percentage is gonna
make you happy

10:38.725 --> 10:40.422
of fixing your nose?

10:40.465 --> 10:42.380
I know you like
Tiffany Pollard's nose,

10:42.424 --> 10:44.600
and that was a virgin nose
that we operated on,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.602
but we'll see what we can do.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.082
80 to 90%.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.389
That's kind of a high number.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.130
That's a scary number.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.742
Your expectations
have to come down

10:55.785 --> 10:59.093
because I am operating
on damaged tissue.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.359
I'm okay with 50%.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.708
All right, well, that's--
that's fine.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.841
- I'm okay with that.
- 40.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.451
40? Oh, it's even dropped
to 40. That's fine.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.452
We don't need to go
lower than that right now.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.062
- Right.
- Unless you have

11:12.106 --> 11:14.935
some major catastrophe which
we wanna make sure you don't.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.458
Yes.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.938
If it were up to you,
would you have her do--

11:17.981 --> 11:20.636
Let's say she were 17.
Would you sign the consent form?

11:20.680 --> 11:21.768
No.

11:21.811 --> 11:22.769
You want her to stay
the way she is?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.292
Yes.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.686
I work in the medical field
for 17 years,

11:26.729 --> 11:29.906
and I am very anxious about it
just thinking about

11:29.950 --> 11:33.518
what her body have been through
and doing it again.

11:33.562 --> 11:38.132
Oh, my God. That's too much
trauma on one patient body.

11:38.175 --> 11:41.744
I think she's more nervous,
this whole process, that's why.

11:41.788 --> 11:42.832
- You want to do it?
- Yes.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.574
- Ready to go?
- Let's go. No doubts.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.402
All right, well, let's do this.
I'm up for it.

11:47.445 --> 11:48.533
- Yeah, mon, me, too.
- Let's go for it. Yeah, mon.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.231
- Yeah, mon.
- Yeah, mon, let's do it.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.319
Yeah, mon.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.630
I can't believe she's already 3.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.762
I know.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.851
Thank you for coming
to help set up.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.986
Is it hurting your leg at all
being up there?

12:06.029 --> 12:07.552
It's just not steady.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.077
- Be careful.
- My name's Kaitlyn,

12:10.120 --> 12:11.556
and my knee does not match
my body.

12:11.600 --> 12:17.519
My left knee looks
very disfigured, discolored.

12:17.562 --> 12:21.262
The texture is very odd,
and it has a lot of loose skin.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.959
Disgusting.

12:23.003 --> 12:26.658
My knee kind of crackle
whenever I extend it.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.359
My son--he always makes fun
of the way that I run

12:31.402 --> 12:33.187
and says I look like
an injured deer.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.537
I can't sit on my knees.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.582
Like, bending down
to put the kids in the bath--

12:37.626 --> 12:39.846
I just don't have the
coordination in that knee.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.544
It is upsetting
that you're not able to do

12:42.587 --> 12:43.806
the things that you wanna do.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.940
I am tired of people
looking at my knee,

12:46.983 --> 12:49.333
people just very rudely
stare at you,

12:49.377 --> 12:51.074
tell you
that it looks disgusting

12:51.118 --> 12:52.510
or "What happened to your knee?
That does not match your face."

12:52.554 --> 12:56.427
Sometimes it makes me sad.
Sometimes it pisses me off.

12:56.471 --> 12:59.039
I just can't believe
that where we're at today.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.389
What are the chances
of being able to come

13:01.432 --> 13:04.566
to such awesome surgeons?

13:04.609 --> 13:06.524
I'm hoping that Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

13:06.568 --> 13:08.483
can make my knee look better.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.572
This is not something that
I wanna deal with

13:10.615 --> 13:12.182
for the rest of my life.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.749
Nice to meet you.
Dr. Nassif. How are you?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.490
- Hi, Kaitlyn. Terry Dubrow.
- Hi.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.493
Please have a seat.
So I'd like to get right to it

13:18.536 --> 13:20.582
because this is kind of
a complicated problem.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.149
How did this happen?

13:22.192 --> 13:25.587
All right, well, it's been
two years since the accident.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.458
- I was on a float trip.
- A what trip?

13:27.502 --> 13:29.591
- A float trip.
- Like a lazy river...

13:29.634 --> 13:30.635
- Yeah.
- ...kind of a thing.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.246
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.856
So it sounds like a float trip
is partying on a float boat.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.379
Yeah. There's a bunch
of rope swings,

13:35.423 --> 13:38.861
and I fell off. It was about
10 to 15 feet that I fell,

13:38.905 --> 13:42.256
and I hit my left knee
on a rock ledge.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.561
- Ahh.
- Ugh.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.129
It obviously
burst open your skin.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.522
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

13:47.565 --> 13:49.654
- And broke your knee bone.
- Yeah.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.308
- Open fracture.
- Yep.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.354
And that's something, especially
with all that beautiful water.

13:53.397 --> 13:54.703
With all those organisms
in there, okay, so...

13:54.746 --> 13:56.096
- Yeah.
- There's your infection.

13:56.139 --> 14:01.492
So an open fracture is called
a type III injury,

14:01.536 --> 14:03.277
meaning it's the most severe

14:03.320 --> 14:05.888
because not only
is the bone broken,

14:05.932 --> 14:10.327
but the skin's open, so you have
immediate contamination.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.633
More than a third of people

14:11.676 --> 14:14.418
who suffer contaminated
open fractures

14:14.462 --> 14:16.856
of their extremities
will lose that extremity.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.640
- Where was this?
- They were in--

14:18.683 --> 14:19.815
- This was in Noel, Missouri.
- Yeah, Noel, Missouri.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.469
- Noem?
- It's the middle of nowhere.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.123
- Noel.
- And how far away were you

14:23.166 --> 14:25.777
from a medical center?
- It was an hour from there

14:25.821 --> 14:27.823
to their trauma center
in Kansas.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.695
Mm. Okay, so what happened
at the trauma center?

14:30.739 --> 14:34.134
They had started me
on IV antibiotics at that point.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.265
Of course.

14:35.309 --> 14:36.788
I was running a temp in pre-op.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.965
- You were in the pre-op area.
- Mm-hmm.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.880
About to go to surgery
and have hardware put in.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.229
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

14:42.272 --> 14:43.926
- And you had a fever.
- Mm-hmm.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.711
To fix an open fracture
like Kaitlyn had,

14:46.755 --> 14:48.975
you put internal hardware
to allow the bone

14:49.018 --> 14:52.239
to be stabilized
and allow it to heal.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.589
Generally, you can leave it
in there permanently

14:54.632 --> 14:57.244
unless it starts to cause
a problem like pain,

14:57.287 --> 15:02.727
and then in the future,
it sometimes has to be removed.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.729
So then what happened?
Went to the operating room

15:04.773 --> 15:06.427
and they just...
threw it in?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.298
They put it in, yup,
and then--

15:08.342 --> 15:11.127
- And they closed the wound.
- Closed it up, yep.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.563
And then I told them

15:12.607 --> 15:15.436
that I could smell
my infection in my knee.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.438
How many days are we post
the procedure?

15:17.481 --> 15:18.961
Like two.

15:19.005 --> 15:22.530
I've seen this exact situation
where it starts to smell.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.184
They open up the dressing,

15:24.227 --> 15:29.145
and there are maggots
in the wound. I kid you not.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.973
And so then I had surgery.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.540
Opened it up,
left the hardware in,

15:32.583 --> 15:35.673
and then a wound VAC on.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.894
So when they opened the wound
to put a wound VAC in--

15:38.938 --> 15:41.984
and this is a key question--
was the hardware exposed?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.420
- Yes.
- Was it in the wound?

15:43.464 --> 15:45.118
So they had exposed hardware
that they're treating

15:45.161 --> 15:47.468
with a wound VAC.
- Yeah.

15:47.511 --> 15:51.559
That is an absolute setup
for infection

15:51.602 --> 15:54.214
that will seed itself
into the bone,

15:54.257 --> 15:57.391
cause osteomyelitis
and put you at great risk

15:57.434 --> 15:58.305
for losing your leg.

15:58.348 --> 16:01.047
Never, ever do that.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.353
I've been an expert
for the California Medical Board

16:03.397 --> 16:06.052
for over 21 years,

16:06.095 --> 16:09.403
and this is
absolute medical negligence.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.926
Yeah.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.755
I went to a different doctor
to get my second opinion.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.539
He said, "If you would've

16:15.583 --> 16:16.888
left that there,
you would've lost your leg."

16:16.932 --> 16:19.369
He--They took the hardware out
the next day.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.849
Whoa.

16:20.892 --> 16:24.940
That point, you know, they said,
"We can do this flap."

16:24.984 --> 16:26.420
So the ortho guy did that flap.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.248
Did they put hardware
at the same time?

16:28.291 --> 16:31.599
Mm-hmm, yep. I still had
a knee fracture at that point.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.601
- So did it heal at that point?
- Yeah.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.604
- How long ago was this?
- In 2017.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.519
And here you are with this,

16:38.562 --> 16:40.782
for lack of a better word,
disfigurement.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.088
How does it bother you?

16:42.131 --> 16:44.133
I do have pain
right in the front.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.005
I can't put a lot of weight.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.399
Like, I can't get down my knees,
and, like, play with the kids.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.706
As a mother, I don't want her
to have to feel that way

16:51.749 --> 16:55.057
for...the majority of her life.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.538
- So it bothers you a lot.
- Yeah.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.627
We asked for your complete
medical records,

16:59.670 --> 17:03.761
and as it turns out,
on your X-ray,

17:03.805 --> 17:08.027
you actually have
broken hardware.

17:08.070 --> 17:13.989
You have checked every disaster
you can possibly check.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.126
- How much of it can we remove?
- And bend the knee.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.779
And still be able to bend
your knee? Not much.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.130
It's actually really tricky.
If I don't take enough,

17:24.173 --> 17:27.394
she won't be cosmetically happy,
and if I take too much,

17:27.437 --> 17:29.135
she won't be able
to flex properly.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.136
It's emotional.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.009
Wait.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.621
Haven't seen that before...ever.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.886
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

17:43.497 --> 17:46.108
Kaitlyn, first thing I wanna do
is show you

17:46.152 --> 17:48.241
this broken hardware.
Look at this.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.287
That shouldn't be discontinuous.

17:51.331 --> 17:54.638
If you have knee pain,
it needs to come out.

17:54.682 --> 17:58.120
What I'd like to do is have
my buddy, Dr. Scott Forman,

17:58.164 --> 18:00.296
who's the most outstanding
orthopedic surgeon,

18:00.340 --> 18:01.732
figure out what to do
about that.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.473
- Right.
- Okay.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.388
What to do about this
cosmetically?

18:05.432 --> 18:08.783
We can tattoo the skin graft
to match the surrounding skin,

18:08.826 --> 18:13.831
but you've got these bunched up
contour irregularities.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.965
The question is, how much of it
can we remove?

18:17.008 --> 18:18.445
And bend the knee.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.664
And still be able to bend
your knee? Not much.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.363
Removing the proper amount of
skin is actually really tricky.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.842
If I don't take enough,

18:24.886 --> 18:28.281
I'm not gonna fix
her contour irregularities,

18:28.324 --> 18:29.717
and she won't be
cosmetically happy.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.153
And if I take too much,

18:31.197 --> 18:33.677
she won't be able to flex
and extend properly,

18:33.721 --> 18:38.769
so this is form versus function
in many ways.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.380
What do you think about this?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.295
If we're doing the hardware,
and that helps with the pain,

18:42.338 --> 18:43.774
then...
- You're in.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.341
Yeah, I'm in.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.256
I have absolutely zero fear
in this.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.519
We were brought here
for a reason.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.391
It's funny, because a lot of
people would be skeptical.

18:51.434 --> 18:54.176
I mean, you had
a really bad experience

18:54.220 --> 18:56.222
with the medical system
in Kansas.

18:56.265 --> 18:59.486
But forgive me.
You're not in Kansas anymore.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.533
That's real funny.

19:08.408 --> 19:11.672
Oh, my God, Mom, I'm so scared.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.195
Don't be scared.
It'll be okay.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.675
Oh, Jesus.

19:14.718 --> 19:18.200
Oh, I'm so nervous. I'm, like,
having anxiety, emotion.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.028
I'm excited, though.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.725
I appreciate you're there
for me.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.859
Your emotion will come,
and it's gonna be okay.

19:24.902 --> 19:28.732
Even though my mom is not a fan
of plastic surgery at all,

19:28.776 --> 19:31.170
but just to be here
to support me with all this...

19:34.434 --> 19:35.957
That shows how much love
she has for me.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.567
I'm ready for you.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.743
Ooh. Bye, Ma.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.447
<i>
Today for Cadine's surgery,</i>

19:47.490 --> 19:49.188
<i>I'll begin by opening up</i> <i>
the nose</i>

19:49.231 --> 19:51.233
<i>while Dr. Peng harvests rib.</i>

19:51.277 --> 19:53.583
<i>Next, I will fracture</i> <i>
the bones to narrow the nose</i>

19:53.627 --> 19:55.759
<i>before adding diced cartilage</i> <i>
glue grafts</i>

19:55.803 --> 19:58.240
<i>to build up her dorsum</i> <i>
and give her tip rejection.</i>

19:58.284 --> 20:01.243
<i>Finally, I will come on the
outside and inside of her nose,</i>

20:01.287 --> 20:04.725
<i>called alar base reduction,
and use articulating rim grafts</i>

20:04.768 --> 20:08.816
<i>to give her narrower,</i> <i>
symmetric nostrils.</i>

20:09.817 --> 20:14.430
Gonna start now cutting--
scrape through scar tissue.

20:14.474 --> 20:15.997
It's a bloody mess in here.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.564
You know, it's almost like

20:17.607 --> 20:19.435
a small bomb went off
inside the nose.

20:19.479 --> 20:22.133
This looks like sh--.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.570
Jesus, look at that.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.833
This is just like meat,
ground beef.

20:25.876 --> 20:29.053
I don't know what it looks like.
Ground pork.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.491
Going through Cadine's nose,
it's like a war zone.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.841
I can't see normal anatomy.

20:33.884 --> 20:37.453
I'm not seeing anything
identifiable.

20:37.497 --> 20:41.283
This easily is
in the top 10 worst nasal

20:41.327 --> 20:42.502
anatomic disfigurements
that I've ever seen.

20:42.545 --> 20:46.157
The rib is coming out.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.813
So this is the reconstruction.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.163
This is
the diced cartilage glue graft

20:52.207 --> 20:53.556
going in a different pipe
through the nose

20:53.600 --> 20:57.168
to augment the dorsum,
to make the tip look better,

20:57.212 --> 20:59.258
to make the profile look better.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.303
And yet these
articulated rim grafts

21:01.347 --> 21:03.653
can help make the nostrils
more even.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.917
Cadine's nose use all of her rib
on her reconstruction.

21:06.961 --> 21:09.529
Usually, there's always a piece
of rib left over.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.574
But with Cadine,
there was nothing left

21:11.618 --> 21:15.491
because her nose was so mangled
from her previous surgeries.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.928
This is
a massive reconstruction.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.540
Okay, so we're starting
the incisions

21:20.583 --> 21:23.630
for the alar base reduction.

21:23.673 --> 21:27.329
This is to narrow the nostrils
and the flare of the nostrils.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.809
We're performing
a base reduction.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.333
We take out a little
diamond shape of tissue,

21:31.377 --> 21:33.074
basically cut on the inside.

21:33.117 --> 21:35.859
That would decrease the width
inside the nose

21:35.903 --> 21:37.513
called the nasal sill.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.210
Hopefully,
this will make her nose

21:39.254 --> 21:40.864
look like Tiffany Pollard's.

21:40.908 --> 21:44.390
Right now I just don't know if
she's gonna get what she wants.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.131
Well, hopefully,
didn't make this too small.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.352
- Thank you all.
- Thank you.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.924
So what do we have?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.926
We have
a very interesting patient

21:58.969 --> 22:00.449
named Serena.

22:00.493 --> 22:03.496
She has a lot of the things
that could occur

22:03.539 --> 22:07.108
when you're undergoing
the male to female transition.

22:07.151 --> 22:10.546
So you can see a very
significant animation deformity.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.156
Let's bring in Serena and see
what's going on with her.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.986
Sure, let's do it.
Can you please send in Serena?

22:16.030 --> 22:19.120
- Serena.
- Hello!

22:19.163 --> 22:21.078
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.210
- Hi. I'm Dr. Nassif.
- Hi, Serena. Terry Dubrow.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.516
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.256
I'm very excited
to see the doctors.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.736
Even though I love
my boyfriend,

22:26.780 --> 22:29.086
I have a little crush
on Dr. Nassif.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.653
I love a hairy man.

22:30.697 --> 22:33.264
I can't contain my freakiness.

22:33.308 --> 22:34.701
And how did you guys meet?

22:34.744 --> 22:36.572
Through the internet
'cause nobody goes out anymore.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.444
Wait. When you say you met
on the internet,

22:38.487 --> 22:39.575
how did that happen?
- Instagram. It's like,

22:39.619 --> 22:40.968
you know, Direct Message.
- Instagram.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.405
So are you guys kind of
influencers on Instagram?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.799
Yeah, I like to promote
what I'm doing--my music.

22:45.842 --> 22:47.757
- So you're a musician.
- Yes.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.368
So would you say
your musical tastes

22:49.411 --> 22:51.457
are of this era or another era?

22:51.500 --> 22:54.155
I mean, I was raised
on Britney Spears.

22:54.198 --> 22:59.421
Early 2000s--definitely
an influence, an inspiration.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.031
- All right.
- I know. Uh, are we gonna

23:01.075 --> 23:02.424
be able to get
a little taste of that?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.600
You can get a taste

23:50.472 --> 23:52.256
Transitioned really young,

23:52.300 --> 23:53.997
- At 13?
- Yeah.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.739

23:56.783 --> 23:57.827

- Always.
- Yeah.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.963
I remember one time I came home
from a friend's house.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.486
I had her little Halloween wig.
I opened the door.

24:04.530 --> 24:08.490
I remember my dad answered,
and he said, "Who's that?"

24:08.534 --> 24:10.187
- Mm.
- I always--I love my parents.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.755
I always had a really great
relationship with them.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.062
Your parents were
completely cool with it.

- Always.

like, being kicked out or told
not to do what they're doing.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.425
And it sucks.
I was always supported.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.514
Just positive encouragement.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.211
Sometimes that's all

Mm-hmm.

25:29.397 --> 25:33.357
I'm the father of three girls
and a boy,

25:33.401 --> 25:35.925
and this story
just really got to me

25:35.969 --> 25:40.451
because I'm so concerned about
every little thing with my kids,

25:40.495 --> 25:43.324
and it just reminds me
how important it is

25:43.367 --> 25:45.369
to be a supportive parent,
and when you're not,

25:45.413 --> 25:48.416
how devastating it can be
on your children.

25:48.459 --> 25:51.288
Okay, I feel better.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.595
I just had a moment,
an emotional moment.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.292
- Welcome back.
- Sorry about that.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.555
- No, you're fine.
- I guess I was just tapping

25:56.598 --> 26:00.471
into what it would be like
to not be happy

26:00.515 --> 26:01.385
with the way you were born,
you know what I mean?

26:01.429 --> 26:02.604
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.606
A lot of what we do
as plastic surgeons

26:04.650 --> 26:06.695
is people aren't happy
with the way they're born,

26:06.739 --> 26:10.351
or the way they've become
as they get older.

26:10.394 --> 26:11.657
By the way, I'm so happy
for you guys because...

26:11.700 --> 26:14.616
- Thank you.
- You both look beautiful.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.313
- Thank you.
- And you both look happy.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.011
And I'm so glad your parents
are so accepting.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.490
Thank you.

26:19.534 --> 26:20.927
What was the first thing
you did?

26:20.970 --> 26:23.625
My breasts. 450 cc's.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.322
Under the muscle.

26:25.366 --> 26:28.674
Yes, which I think I might
be regretting.

26:28.717 --> 26:32.373
My problem is if I lift
my arm or flex...

26:32.416 --> 26:34.462
- Mm.
- ...I get a separation.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.595
Did your doctor tell you
you might get that animation?

26:36.638 --> 26:37.987
- No.
- See, that is the challenge...

26:38.031 --> 26:40.642
- Mm-hmm.
- ...with someone who has

26:40.686 --> 26:42.601
very little breast tissue
to start with.

26:42.644 --> 26:45.778
Yeah. And that's not
what I want.

26:45.821 --> 26:48.171
- And I want them bigger.
- Like how much bigger?

26:48.215 --> 26:51.653
- 1,200, 1,000.
- Oh.

26:51.697 --> 26:54.656
- I like to grab attention.
- Yeah, we can see that.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.311
So let's go in the exam room,
have a look,

26:57.354 --> 26:59.530
and see how we can advise you,
okay?

26:59.574 --> 27:02.272
My feeling is that Serena's not
gonna listen to any advice.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.100
If she wants to go
to the extreme,

27:04.144 --> 27:05.711
she's gonna do it.

27:05.754 --> 27:06.929
Hello.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.192
- Look at those shoes. Wow.
- Wow!

27:09.236 --> 27:10.150
- Do you love?
- Look at 'em.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.194
- Nice.
- You love?

27:11.238 --> 27:12.369
- I do.
- I love.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.545
How can you say this foot
is not gorgeous?

27:14.589 --> 27:15.851
They're Loubou--

27:15.895 --> 27:16.939
- Christian Louboutin.
- Christian Louboutin.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.158
- Is that what they are?
- He knows.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.247
- Exactly.
- Serena, let me give you

27:20.290 --> 27:22.466
a piece of advice, if you're
looking for somebody

27:22.510 --> 27:24.077
who's gonna support
your "Pricy Bitch" thing,

27:24.120 --> 27:26.209
he's not it, okay?
This guy is cheap.

27:26.253 --> 27:29.343
- I'm frugal is the right--
- Oh, frugal.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.693
Oh, very benign way
of saying "cheap bitch."

27:31.737 --> 27:33.216
She's a pricy bitch.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.958
♪ She's a cheap bitch,
not a dollar in her pocket ♪

27:36.002 --> 27:39.135
♪ If you wanna go somewhere,
you better bring your wallet ♪

27:40.659 --> 27:43.052
- I can have you on the album.
- Mm-hmm.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.446
The doctors are loving
my song.

27:45.489 --> 27:49.363
Obviously, I think they could
pass as pricy bitches for sure.

27:49.406 --> 27:52.192
On a more serious note,
the breast situation.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.715
- Mm-hmm.
- So do me favor.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.936
Put your hands on your hips
and push. That's...

27:56.979 --> 27:58.546
This is where I get the problem.

27:58.589 --> 28:02.376
Yeah, your old crease
was probably right there.

28:02.419 --> 28:03.856
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. So that shows

28:03.899 --> 28:07.860
where your muscle used to be
down here and down here.

28:07.903 --> 28:11.211
So the question is how much
bigger can you go

28:11.254 --> 28:15.737
and get minimal worsening
of the animation?

28:15.781 --> 28:17.304
I think you could do 600.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.568
What say you?

28:20.611 --> 28:21.525
That's small.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.049
- Bigger?
- No. I think you--

28:23.092 --> 28:24.572
You think I could go 1,000?

28:24.615 --> 28:27.053
- I don't think--No. <i>No.</i>
- Bigger.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.837
That's more than twice
your size.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.709
I'd be willing to increase
Serena's implants

28:30.752 --> 28:35.409
by about 200 cc's and fix
her animation deformity

28:35.452 --> 28:37.585
by releasing the muscle
from the underlying tissue.

28:37.628 --> 28:41.023
If I go any larger,
all that's going to do

28:41.067 --> 28:44.853
is create a bigger problem to
fix than she had originally.

28:44.897 --> 28:48.901
And at the end of the day,
Paul and I fix deformities.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.598
We try not to create them.

28:50.641 --> 28:53.732
If you go big, big,
it's gonna make new problems.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.430
Your surgeon, to put
a bigger implant in there,

28:56.473 --> 28:58.432
would have to lower
the crease more,

28:58.475 --> 29:00.739
just to make space,
and if they did that,

29:00.782 --> 29:07.136
you'd get that blub bubble
of implant mound below it.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.703
- Yeah.
- The double bubble.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.532
So is that something that's
common with trans patients?

29:11.575 --> 29:15.449
It's common with anyone
who has a short distance

29:15.492 --> 29:17.581
from their
natural inframammary crease

29:17.625 --> 29:20.106
to the bottom of their areola.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.761
What if I did over the muscle?

29:22.804 --> 29:25.589
The over the muscle would fix
the animation problem,

29:25.633 --> 29:26.939
the flexion problem.
- Okay.

29:26.982 --> 29:30.943
But it wouldn't fix
the double bubble problem.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.859
The bigger you go,
the bigger the double bubble.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.687
I don't know. I think the risk
might be worth it.

29:36.731 --> 29:39.603
It's not a risk.
It will happen for sure,

29:39.647 --> 29:42.041
no question about it, mm-hmm.

29:42.084 --> 29:44.260
- You play a hard game.
- I'm telling you the truth.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.436
Dr. Dubrow,
I hear what you're saying,

29:46.480 --> 29:48.961
but I really want 1,000 cc.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.180
I think I'll take my chance
with this one.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.529
Pleasure meeting you. Thank you.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.314
- Nice meeting you.
- Thank you, my darling.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.882
- Love you.
- I caught it.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.579
No boobs for you.

29:58.622 --> 29:59.710
What are you gonna do,
handcuff me

29:59.754 --> 30:01.103
and keep me away
from the surgeon?

30:01.147 --> 30:02.975
Yes.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.324
I might like that, girl.

30:08.981 --> 30:11.374
Kaitlyn. How are you?

30:11.418 --> 30:12.723
- Dr. Forman.
- There you go.

30:12.767 --> 30:13.855
You get the both of us.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.901
Hoping things will change
after surgery.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.990
Obviously, I wanna get
all the hardware out.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.383
Getting it out of there
is gonna get rid of that pain.

30:20.427 --> 30:23.082
It's cosmetic, but it's also,
I think, functional.

30:23.125 --> 30:26.346
See, here's the thing.
I'm kinda racking my brain

30:26.389 --> 30:28.957
to make sure I can give you

30:29.001 --> 30:30.263
something that's substantially
better cosmetically.

30:30.306 --> 30:31.568
Right. Yeah.

30:31.612 --> 30:34.876
Taking the hardware out,
anybody can do that.

30:34.920 --> 30:35.964
Yes.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.879
Anybody with 30 years' experience.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.103
<i>
For Kaitlyn's surgery today,</i>

30:44.146 --> 30:45.669
<i>we'll start by using</i> <i>
a surgical tourniquet</i>

30:45.713 --> 30:48.281
<i>to stop the blood flow</i> <i>
to the leg.</i>

30:48.324 --> 30:50.892
<i>I will then make an incision</i> <i>
through her previous scar</i>

30:50.936 --> 30:53.982
<i>so Dr. Forman can assess
and extract the broken hardware.</i>

30:54.026 --> 30:55.244
<i>Next, we'll deflate</i> <i>
the tourniquet,</i>

30:55.288 --> 30:56.898
<i>and I will debulk the skin graft</i>

30:56.942 --> 30:58.987
<i>and remove</i> <i>
any excess soft tissue,</i>

30:59.031 --> 31:02.512
<i>hoping to give her a better</i> <i>
overall cosmetic result.</i>

31:02.556 --> 31:05.341
So how long can you have
the tourniquet on for?

31:05.385 --> 31:06.995
Two hours before you gotta
let it back down.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.388
That's it. If not,
you would start to get

31:08.431 --> 31:09.911
muscle thrombosis and things,
right?

31:09.955 --> 31:12.261
Uh, you worry about--the nerve
is the first thing to go.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.568
Although the tourniquet
is very useful

31:14.611 --> 31:17.701
for keeping the blood
out of the surgical area

31:17.745 --> 31:19.834
so you can see
what you're doing,

31:19.878 --> 31:22.489
if you don't deflate that
tourniquet in that two hours,

31:22.532 --> 31:24.230
you may get the hardware out,

31:24.273 --> 31:28.016
but you can actually kill
the leg.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.106
Okay, let me take
some scissors.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.413
So that's the wire?

31:33.456 --> 31:35.067
That's the wire,
and I have to clip it out

31:35.110 --> 31:36.503
so we can cut it off.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.418
Boy, it's really incorporated
in the bone.

31:38.461 --> 31:39.593
So I'm gonna try and unbury this

31:39.636 --> 31:40.681
and then follow it down
to the pin.

31:40.724 --> 31:42.030
Yeah.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.945
I love that she made bone
to heal her fracture,

31:43.989 --> 31:46.165
and then she made too much bone.
- Yeah.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.951
Because of Kaitlyn's pain,
her hardware has to come out.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.692
But fortunately,
her bone is healed,

31:51.735 --> 31:54.086
so she no longer needs it.

31:54.129 --> 31:57.437
The problem is, she's developed
so much bony overgrowth,

31:57.480 --> 31:59.961
it's really difficult
to remove it,

32:00.005 --> 32:03.399
and let's face it.
The clock is ticking.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.271
One hour on the tourniquet.

32:05.314 --> 32:07.838
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.146
Ahh.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.453
That sucker is encased
in bone.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.715
Ugh.

32:14.758 --> 32:17.674
Oh, you can tell she's in pain.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.285
Let me just kind of

32:19.328 --> 32:21.156
take a quick peek here.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.288
Let's see what it looks like.

32:22.331 --> 32:26.031
It's critical that the flap
be alive.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.337
Oh, my goodness.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.862
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

32:34.126 --> 32:36.737
Ah. That sucker is encased
in bone.

32:36.780 --> 32:39.218
Ugh.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.439
We only have 30 minutes
to get this hardware out,

32:43.483 --> 32:47.400
but it's completely encased
in overgrown bone.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.750
So it's like
an archaeological find

32:49.793 --> 32:53.101
where you have to chip away
directly over the hardware

32:53.145 --> 32:55.974
and the wire
to get at the hardware itself

32:56.017 --> 32:59.847
without inducing
a patellar fracture again.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.764
Yeah! No pressure at all.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.592
Oh. So close.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.812
Whoa.

33:08.856 --> 33:09.988
Yeah.

33:10.031 --> 33:10.989
That was one
of the broken wires?

33:11.032 --> 33:12.381
Yes. There you go.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.035
- Oh, my God. All of this...
- That's one.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.428
- ...to get this done.
- Wow.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.256
- That's one?
- There's another one.

33:17.299 --> 33:18.648
How many more minutes
do we have left?

33:18.692 --> 33:19.954
24 minutes.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.129
The first half of the hardware

33:21.173 --> 33:23.479
took us 90 minutes
to get it out.

33:23.523 --> 33:26.395
Now we only have 20 minutes
to get the rest of it,

33:26.439 --> 33:28.310
or we have to deflate
the tourniquet,

33:28.354 --> 33:31.139
and it'll be filled with blood,

33:31.183 --> 33:34.316
and we won't be able to see
at all what we need to see.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.711
Ugh, it's really tough.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.716
That's your 10-minute warning.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.457
We're racing against the clock.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.073
- Oh, you're getting it.
- Yeah.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.205
- Yeah!
- Oh!

33:53.248 --> 33:54.858
Yes!

33:54.902 --> 33:55.946
- Nice.
- Damn.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.427
That's two hours.

33:58.471 --> 33:59.689
Ahh!

33:59.733 --> 34:00.908
Good.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.344
Now that the hardware's out,

34:02.388 --> 34:03.606
we're gonna deflate
the tourniquet,

34:03.650 --> 34:04.999
get control of the bleeding,

34:05.043 --> 34:07.567
and start working
on the overlying soft tissue

34:07.610 --> 34:08.959
and the skin graft itself.

34:09.003 --> 34:11.266
Soft tissue time.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.312
I have to be very careful
not to remove too much skin

34:13.355 --> 34:15.444
from Kaitlyn's knee,
because if I do,

34:15.488 --> 34:19.361
when she flexes and extends,
it may rip the whole thing open,

34:19.405 --> 34:20.971
and we'll be back
to square one.

34:21.015 --> 34:24.018
- This looks pretty good.
- Yes.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.064
We removed
the main contour regularities.

34:26.107 --> 34:30.372
We left enough skin so that she
could flex and extend safely.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.070
- Exactly.
- So now it has to heal.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.115
The best way to describe
this case--

34:34.159 --> 34:36.291
huge pain in the ass.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.299
Hello.

34:44.343 --> 34:47.041
- Wow!
- I love the outfit.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.173
Uh-oh. You can tell
she's in pain.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.391
Oh.

34:49.435 --> 34:52.525
- You okay? Ribby?
- Yeah.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.569
You can hold a pillow
when you wanna cough.

34:53.613 --> 34:54.657
Yes.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.006
Make sure you do deep breathing.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.965
You know, and if you need
to take a little Xanax

34:58.008 --> 35:00.315
to relax you, that might get you
to breathe a little bit deeper.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.795
- Half of a pill.
- Okay.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.579
Like, every four or five hours
for maybe two days.

35:03.623 --> 35:04.711
Okay.

35:04.754 --> 35:06.930
So let me just kind of
bring that up.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.107
I just wanna take
a quick peek here.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.935
Sorry. Put your head back
for us.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.068
Yeah. You look beautiful.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.983
- Here you go.
- Look how small that is.

35:16.026 --> 35:16.853
That is so perfect.

35:16.897 --> 35:18.246
Oh, yeah.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.988
Paul has really outdone himself.

35:21.031 --> 35:22.424
I don't know that it looks

35:22.468 --> 35:25.427
exactly like Tiffany's nose
did post-operatively,

35:25.471 --> 35:28.604
but it's pretty close,
and in this situation,

35:28.648 --> 35:31.433
pretty close
is an absolute home run.

35:31.477 --> 35:33.043
I feel good.
I like how it looks,

35:33.087 --> 35:34.175
and I'm extremely happy.
- Did you look at it?

35:34.219 --> 35:36.003
- Yes, I did.
- Looks great.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.222
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you like it.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.441
Mom, what do you think?

35:39.485 --> 35:41.965
I just wanted to see her
look like Cadine again.

35:42.009 --> 35:44.142
I look like Cadine now, Ma.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.143
A little.

35:46.492 --> 35:49.712
I'm more open
to plastic surgery now,

35:49.756 --> 35:52.628
especially being
with the greatest surgeon,

35:52.672 --> 35:56.110
and now seeing that her nose,
it looks good,

35:56.154 --> 35:58.808
and that make me happy.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.985
...and that she gonna be
more herself.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.291
To be honest with you,

36:03.335 --> 36:04.553
this is the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

36:04.597 --> 36:05.989
I might wanna go running
in that outfit.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.687
I'm getting one for my wife.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.169
Am I making you laugh? Sorry.

36:15.434 --> 36:16.783
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

36:16.826 --> 36:19.307
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Oh, Ma, I'm excited.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.918
This journey--I couldn't
do it without you,

36:21.962 --> 36:24.094
so I wanna say thank you
so much, Ma.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.487
You are so welcome.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.620
I just want to see you
out of the pain.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.752
I will be. I will be.

36:29.796 --> 36:32.668
By this weekend,
we'll be dancin'.

36:32.712 --> 36:33.669
Okay.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.242
Well, I'm excited to see
what it looks like.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.852
It's been seven days of...

36:42.896 --> 36:43.984
- Of suspense?
- ...kind of wondering, yes.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.377
- Yeah.
- And waiting.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.727
This is the only surgery
that's gone this smoothly,

36:47.770 --> 36:50.208
so I'm happy for that.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.731
- Hello.
- Hi.

36:51.774 --> 36:54.777
- Wow, what an apparatus.
- That's right.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.084
- So how do you feel?
- I feel really good.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.521
Let's see what it looks like.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.089
It's critical that the flap
be alive,

37:02.132 --> 37:04.526
because if it's not alive,
potentially,

37:04.570 --> 37:06.485
she'll have a worse problem
post-operatively

37:06.528 --> 37:08.748
than she had pre-operatively.

37:08.791 --> 37:12.186
- Wow.
- Thousand times better, right?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.448
- Yeah.
- For sure.

37:13.492 --> 37:14.797
Yeah.

37:14.841 --> 37:18.192
Oh, my goodness. Not even
the same leg or knee.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.541
- Yeah.
- It's an incredible difference.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.369
- It's alive.
- It is alive.

37:21.413 --> 37:22.849
Skin graft looks great.

37:22.892 --> 37:25.547
He was able to get
all of these excess skin.

37:25.591 --> 37:28.550
I'm excited to see, you know,
what it looks like in a week,

37:28.594 --> 37:30.813
two weeks, a month,
you know, out from here.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.859
You're golfing.

37:32.902 --> 37:36.341
- So look who I have here.
- Hi!

37:36.384 --> 37:37.994
I've already experienced
not having

37:38.038 --> 37:40.606
the same day-to-day pains
that I would normally have,

37:40.649 --> 37:42.260
so that's amazing.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.131
You know, it was
a very positive experience,

37:44.174 --> 37:45.915
and I'm so thankful for it.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.787
<i>You're gonna have to probably</i> <i>
wear that brace for six weeks</i>

37:47.830 --> 37:49.354
<i>just to protect it.</i>

37:49.397 --> 37:51.704
<i>If you have a mishap, it could</i> <i>
tear. That would be bad.</i>

37:51.747 --> 37:53.401
<i>- Definitely wear the brace.</i>
- Okay.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.924
<i>Lots of pain, or not too bad?</i>

37:54.968 --> 37:57.927
No, after about two days,
it wasn't bad at all.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.277
<i>Man, you guys are way tougher</i>

37:59.320 --> 38:01.148
<i>than California patients,</i> <i>
I'll say.</i>

38:01.191 --> 38:04.456
Yeah, we'll go back to work,
all right, while you're golfing.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.588
Enjoy. Look at his cigar.

38:06.632 --> 38:07.763
- Okay, bye.
- Talk to you later.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.422
It actually feels amazing
to finally have a surgery

38:14.466 --> 38:15.945
that ended positively.

38:15.989 --> 38:19.427
Now thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
my knee--it's amazing.

38:19.471 --> 38:21.777
Before my surgery,
I honestly thought

38:21.821 --> 38:22.996
my nose looked like
a chicken butt.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.476
Thanks to Dr. Nassif,

38:24.519 --> 38:26.347
this Jamaican is no longer
going crazy.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.914
- Let me see the side.
- Uh, ooh.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.568
Let me see the other side.

38:31.178 --> 38:33.267
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

38:33.311 --> 38:36.009
- Hello there.
- Kaitlyn, how are you?

38:36.052 --> 38:38.228
- How's the knee going?
- It's doing really good.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.795
All my range of motion's back,
and...

38:39.839 --> 38:41.667
- Yeah.
- Pain's a lot better

38:41.710 --> 38:43.233
up top from where
that hardware was.

38:43.277 --> 38:47.368
Wow. Digging out that hardware
was not easy.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.631
I'm so happy Kaitlyn's
knee function has improved.

38:49.675 --> 38:52.112
Her pain is completely gone.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.375
The only thing left
is the cosmetic.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.246
So we're gonna do
some cosmetic tattooing

38:56.290 --> 38:59.032
to try to get the knee skin
to look like

38:59.075 --> 39:01.121
the surrounding peripheral skin.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.209
- Bring it.
- Okay.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.254
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, let's do it.

39:07.170 --> 39:10.870
It actually feels amazing
to finally have a surgery

39:10.913 --> 39:12.959
that ended positively.

39:13.002 --> 39:16.049
It catches me off guard
whenever I see it in the mirror.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.355
- All right.
- Congratulations.

39:17.398 --> 39:20.445
It feels really good
to have matching knees.

39:20.488 --> 39:21.837
Perfect.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.970
- So happy. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.319
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
- It's amazing.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.190
It'll be beautiful.
It's gonna be beautiful.

39:27.234 --> 39:28.670
You know, I'm not gonna let
the past hinder

39:28.714 --> 39:30.977
the things
that I wanna do today.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.109
I'm still young,
and it feels great to be back

39:33.153 --> 39:34.807
to my fun, adventurous self.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.469
You're leaving me.

39:44.512 --> 39:45.992
Come on, slowpoke.

39:46.035 --> 39:49.125
Before my surgery, my knee
was disfigured, discolored,

39:49.169 --> 39:51.432
and had lots
of loose, saggy skin.

39:51.476 --> 39:54.174
The nonstop stares and comments
made me feel so insecure.

39:54.217 --> 39:57.307
I was in constant pain,
and I just wasn't able

39:57.351 --> 39:59.092
to be as active
as I wanted to be.

39:59.135 --> 40:00.354
But now thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

40:00.398 --> 40:02.443
my knee actually looks
pretty normal.

40:02.487 --> 40:03.966
The saggy skin is gone.

40:04.010 --> 40:05.925
The skin tone actually matches
my other knee,

40:05.968 --> 40:08.057
and I'm pain-free.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.363
No more rope swings
for this girl.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.366
I am staying in the kayak
this time.

40:16.544 --> 40:21.114
You know, Dr. Dubrow,
Dr. Nassif, Dr. Forman--

40:21.157 --> 40:23.899
they were able to fix it,
make it look, you know,

40:23.943 --> 40:25.248
a hundred times better,
I feel like.

40:25.292 --> 40:28.774
I mean, I never expected that
four years ago.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.471
I would like to tell Dr. Dubrow
thank you,

40:30.515 --> 40:34.519
just being able to do
day-to-day things with my kids.

40:34.562 --> 40:37.870
You not only
changed my life physically,

40:37.913 --> 40:40.960
but you have just, like,
my well-being

40:41.003 --> 40:42.657
and everything as well.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.877
I'm glad you weren't afraid
to get back out there.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.618
I know. It does feel nice.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.502
Before my surgery,
I did not go a day

41:01.546 --> 41:04.070
without my hair, Lucy,
to hide my nose.

41:04.113 --> 41:06.202
Lucy was a shield for me.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.465
- Hey, girls.
- Hey.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.640
Hey.

41:08.683 --> 41:10.990
But now I decided
to cut Lucy loose

41:11.033 --> 41:13.427
because I can be comfortable
with myself

41:13.471 --> 41:16.909
and show this beautiful look
of mine that I call Sasha.

41:16.952 --> 41:21.522
<i>♪ Got to turn it up,</i> <i>
yeah, we're gonna celebrate ♪</i>

41:21.566 --> 41:23.742
- Girl, I feel good.
- You got a glow about you.

41:23.785 --> 41:26.048
Sasha bring out this light
in me.

41:26.092 --> 41:28.877
I knew that Dr. Nassif would
work his magic on my nose,

41:28.921 --> 41:30.488
but let's just say

41:30.531 --> 41:33.839
Tiffany Pollard might just be
jealous of <i>my</i> nose.

41:33.882 --> 41:34.970
- Let me see the side.
- Oh, okay.

41:35.014 --> 41:36.406
Oh, girl, let me see
the other side.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.712
Girl, look at that.
Look at that.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.105
You look so good.

41:39.148 --> 41:40.454
- Thank you, sis.
- Her confidence

41:40.498 --> 41:42.325
is through the roof.
- Through the roof.

41:42.369 --> 41:43.762
She's done a 180.

41:43.805 --> 41:45.198
I'm so glad I have
my friend back.

41:45.241 --> 41:48.288
Before my surgery,
my nose was Jamaican me crazy.

41:48.331 --> 41:51.421
It had a weird "V" shape
hanging down.

41:51.465 --> 41:54.337
I honestly thought my nose
looked like a chicken butt,

41:54.381 --> 41:58.603
but now thanks to Dr. Nassif,
the chicken butt is gone.

41:58.646 --> 42:01.867
The shape is beautiful,
and I absolutely love it.

42:01.910 --> 42:03.129
I feel amazing,

42:03.172 --> 42:06.393
and this Jamaican
is no longer going crazy.

42:06.436 --> 42:09.048
- Say hi to everyone, Ma.
- Hey, Mommy!

42:09.091 --> 42:12.791
What did you think about
her nose before versus now?

42:12.834 --> 42:15.271
<i>She looks much, much better now.</i>

42:15.315 --> 42:17.056
My family's against surgery.

42:17.099 --> 42:19.014
She's totally not against it
anymore,

42:19.058 --> 42:21.103
because she see
that it helps me.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.932
I can't thank her enough
for her support and her love.

42:23.976 --> 42:25.847
- It means a lot to me.
- The doctors--

42:25.891 --> 42:28.633
they really were able
to bring the light back to her.

42:28.676 --> 42:31.853
<i>Yes, I'm happy because</i> <i>
she's happy. "A"-plus.</i>

42:31.897 --> 42:34.073
- Ooh, "A"-plus.
- "A"-plus.

42:34.116 --> 42:36.510
You got an "A"-plus from Mommy.
Okay.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.600
I can't thank Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow enough.

42:39.644 --> 42:43.343
I can't. Words cannot explain
how I feel inside

42:43.386 --> 42:46.172
just to give me this, you know,
confidence back,

42:46.215 --> 42:49.436
this smile.
This happiness.

42:49.479 --> 42:52.178
This is a blessing.
You guys know my pain.

42:52.221 --> 42:53.614
You guys know what
I went through.

42:53.658 --> 42:56.182
Now I can shine.
World, are you ready for me?

42:56.225 --> 42:57.618
Here I come.

42:57.662 --> 43:00.099
- To me and my new look, Boo.
- Yes.

43:00.142 --> 43:01.709
- We're going to the club now!
- Yes!

43:01.753 --> 43:03.189
Hey!

43:03.232 --> 43:06.540
There's nothing stopping you
from achieving a lot more

43:06.584 --> 43:08.020
when you're literally there
naked.

43:08.063 --> 43:09.630
After our consultation,

43:09.674 --> 43:13.460
I could teach you how to swing
on or off.

43:13.503 --> 43:15.854
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby.

43:15.897 --> 43:17.551
I've always called 'em
the janky boobs.

43:17.595 --> 43:18.944
That's her double bubble.

43:18.987 --> 43:20.423
How many times
have you seen this?

43:20.467 --> 43:21.555
Never.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.078
When I was 1 years old,

43:23.122 --> 43:26.386
a flesh-eating bacteria
destroyed my nose.

43:26.429 --> 43:29.781
Take a look at her cannula.
It looks a little bit grayish.

43:29.824 --> 43:33.175
Oh, sh--, this is exactly what
I was worried about.
