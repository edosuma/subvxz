WEBVTT

00:01.666 --> 00:02.466
Rick and Miranda
have just eloped.

00:02.533 --> 00:03.600
We'll be free.

00:03.666 --> 00:04.933
'You know, just the two of us.'

00:05.000 --> 00:07.233
They're running away
from mom and dad.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.466
You two disgust me.

00:09.533 --> 00:11.266
'Breaking your parents' hearts.'

00:11.333 --> 00:13.300
But will the honeymoon

00:13.366 --> 00:15.666
turn into a living hell?

00:16.766 --> 00:18.800
I guess, they just need a..

00:18.866 --> 00:21.400
...crash coursein growin' u

00:21.466 --> 00:24.300
On the next
"Nightmare On Elm Street.

00:24.366 --> 00:27.366
The Series,
Freddy's Nightmares".

00:48.566 --> 00:51.200
I'll be back! I'm free!

01:52.066 --> 01:53.033
Is this where you want to spend

01:53.100 --> 01:54.333
the first night
of our honeymoon?

01:54.400 --> 01:56.366
Uh, huh, uh-uh.

01:57.700 --> 02:01.366
Uh...yes, Miranda,
you have won a wedding night!

02:01.433 --> 02:03.433
A no expense paid
holiday to that

02:03.500 --> 02:07.366
exotic fog and cold
capital of the world..

02:07.433 --> 02:08.933
...Springwood.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.066
Let's hope there's
a phone booth up the road.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.400
This is what I get
for buying a Yup mobile.

02:15.466 --> 02:18.166
Should have been able to fix
this, I'm good with my hands.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.666
Ooh, very good with your hands.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.766
Umm.

02:22.833 --> 02:25.766
I like that attitude.

02:25.833 --> 02:29.000
That and a tow truck
would get us out of this mess.

02:29.066 --> 02:32.633
Come on, why elope unless you're
heart for a little adventure.

02:34.700 --> 02:38.166
Besides, when my parents
and your old man

02:38.233 --> 02:41.766
figure out that we cut loose
from college and got married

02:41.833 --> 02:44.566
they're gonna send out
some serious blood hounds.

02:44.633 --> 02:48.366
Yes, but by then we'll be dining
out sea food in San Francisco.

02:49.933 --> 02:52.100
That is if
we survive Springwood.

03:07.566 --> 03:09.333
Bad valves.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.466
It's a shame those nice kids
bought a ticket to freedom..

03:16.333 --> 03:18.933
...only to have me punch it.

03:24.966 --> 03:27.166
Three hours and no phone booth

03:27.233 --> 03:30.800
no passing cars, nothin'.

03:30.866 --> 03:32.833
Maybe we made a mistake.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.233
Yeah, we should have
stood back with the car.

03:37.566 --> 03:39.600
No, I meant about leaving home.

03:40.866 --> 03:42.633
Come on.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.466
Uh-uh, my daddy
was makin' me mental.

03:45.533 --> 03:49.300
And your folks, Miranda, your
folks were always in your face.

03:49.366 --> 03:51.733
That's because they loved us.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.466
Because they didn't
want us to grow up.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.033
They didn't think we're ready,
there's a big difference.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.533
Come on, get real, Miranda.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.000
I mean, my daddy,
he-he picked out my prep school.

03:59.066 --> 04:01.300
He picked out my college,
he chose my clothes.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.033
He ch..
The guy chose my friends.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.966
And even when
we went fishing, he was always

04:07.033 --> 04:09.866
his rods, his hooks, his bait.

04:09.933 --> 04:12.300
Your dad's not that terrible.

04:12.366 --> 04:14.966
No, he's just an unsung hero
trying to bring

04:15.033 --> 04:16.866
fascism back and above.

04:16.933 --> 04:18.633
And my parents
were pretty supportive.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.500
Umm, um-hmm.

04:20.566 --> 04:23.066
They just wouldn't
let us live together.

04:23.133 --> 04:25.066
"Over our dead bodies!"
Remember that?

04:35.266 --> 04:37.733
Well, here we are.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.733
The great escape.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.933
Hey..

04:44.033 --> 04:46.700
...everything's gonna
be okay, you know.

04:46.766 --> 04:48.466
We're gonna live our own lives.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.466
I'm just not as sure as you are.

04:53.533 --> 04:55.466
Then you can go back
and you can live in your little

04:55.533 --> 04:57.566
goldfish bowl,
I don't care but not me.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.233
Do you want to run away
from me too?

05:08.033 --> 05:09.266
No, I just..

05:16.666 --> 05:18.033
Sorry.

05:19.633 --> 05:20.700
Sorry.

05:22.566 --> 05:25.500
Umm, I'll always love you, Rick.

05:25.566 --> 05:27.500
From here to heaven.

05:36.766 --> 05:38.233
Why didn't we see it before?

05:38.300 --> 05:40.400
Who cares, we're saved!

05:43.966 --> 05:46.866
Rick, what's that noise?

05:51.300 --> 05:53.500
Oh, my God!

05:53.566 --> 05:55.200
Oh, my God, Rick.

05:55.266 --> 05:58.400
Rick...aah!

06:19.233 --> 06:21.600
Please, help us.

06:21.666 --> 06:23.033
You got a problem, young lady?

06:23.100 --> 06:25.033
We need a lift to Springwood.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.133
We have to get to a hospital.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.966
I got hit crossin' the road.

06:29.033 --> 06:31.933
Oh, you're lucky, son,
could have been a lot worse.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.533
'We'd be happy
to help you kids out.'

06:34.600 --> 06:36.833
But first,
you call your parents.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.766
Uh, I think I can
skip that part.

06:42.766 --> 06:46.366
George and I have 23 grandkids.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.733
We know what it's like to worry.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.733
Call them.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.966
Umm, well, actually, folks..

06:54.033 --> 06:56.466
...Miranda and I
have just eloped

06:56.533 --> 06:59.100
and our parents don't really
know about that right now

06:59.166 --> 07:01.233
'so I don't think
that's such a good idea.'

07:03.200 --> 07:04.600
Well, I'm sure you understand.

07:04.666 --> 07:07.900
I mean, who wants to be a big
fish in a small pond, right?

07:07.966 --> 07:10.900
You two disgust me.

07:10.966 --> 07:13.766
'Ungrateful, selfish.'

07:13.833 --> 07:17.700
Breaking your parents' hearts.

07:17.766 --> 07:21.166
- What are you doing?
- Ain't it obvious?

07:21.233 --> 07:23.733
Your wallet, sonny.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.300
Give it over.

07:31.966 --> 07:33.900
That's all our money.

07:36.866 --> 07:40.133
Your parents spent 18 year

07:40.200 --> 07:41.700
paying for your food

07:41.766 --> 07:44.733
'your clothing, your education.'

07:46.166 --> 07:48.733
This is your last

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
free ride.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.133
What do we do now?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.833
Pray the phone calls
are still only a quarter.

08:51.733 --> 08:54.100
Hey, you guys the ones
that need some help?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.366
Oh, yeah.

08:56.433 --> 08:58.433
And you must be Buzz.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.933
Need a tow,
got a car that sucks?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.166
I'll save your ass
for 200 bucks.

09:05.633 --> 09:08.166
We're a little short on cash.

09:08.233 --> 09:11.066
Short on cash,
'cause life is hard.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.433
Will even take
daddy's credit card.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.066
You know, you two
have the worst credit

09:21.133 --> 09:23.866
in the history of this planet.

09:23.933 --> 09:25.466
There is no way our parents

09:25.533 --> 09:27.600
could have
cut us off so quickly.

09:27.666 --> 09:28.733
Sorry.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.733
They won't even know we've
eloped until tomorrow.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.966
Sometimes, parents just know.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.600
We are screwed.
No credit, no money.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.900
No car.

09:46.066 --> 09:48.900
We have to call them.

09:48.966 --> 09:51.766
- Right, we'll beg.
- No.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.800
- We'll-we'll reason with them.
- No.

09:57.033 --> 09:59.666
- We'll get angry.
- Umm, better.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.866
We'll make them feel ashamed
for cutting us off.

10:05.766 --> 10:08.366
That's it. That's the ticket.

10:17.133 --> 10:21.066
'Hello, if this is Miranda,
we miss you honey.'

10:21.133 --> 10:22.533
'But that didn't stop us from'

10:22.600 --> 10:25.433
'burning every thing
you left behind.'

10:25.500 --> 10:29.066
'Daddy even cut your face out
of all the family photographs.'

10:29.133 --> 10:31.300
'Oh, and we also
rented out your room.'

10:31.366 --> 10:33.900
'Uh, hey-hey, freedom
is just another word'

10:33.966 --> 10:36.666
'for nothing left to lose,
Miranda. Ha ha ha.'

10:38.433 --> 10:40.033
I'm calling dad.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.366
'I tried to teach you, Rick.'

10:50.433 --> 10:52.300
'Life is like fishin'.'

10:52.366 --> 10:54.333
'You gotta be patient.'

10:54.400 --> 10:57.600
'You won't catch
the big one by runnin' away.'

10:57.666 --> 11:01.000
'I'm sorry, because now the real
world is going to bury you.'

11:02.266 --> 11:05.033
Dad! Come on, Dad.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.666
Dad!

11:12.733 --> 11:14.300
Rick.

11:14.366 --> 11:16.233
Let's get out of here!

12:21.100 --> 12:23.533
This is my
brother's motor lodge.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.466
Let's hope he has a vacancy.

12:29.633 --> 12:31.566
Todd, are you there?

12:32.266 --> 12:34.733
Land of the bizarre.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.633
Well, it's not so bad.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.366
Considering we look like..

12:39.433 --> 12:42.033
...poster children
for the American Dirt society.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.300
Welcome..

12:47.366 --> 12:49.933
...to the Route 66

12:50.000 --> 12:51.900
motor lodge.

12:51.966 --> 12:54.500
Where life is a little..

12:54.566 --> 12:55.666
...fishy.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.333
I'm Todd.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.433
Buzz's brother.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.966
Now, don't worry.

13:09.033 --> 13:11.500
'I know you're broke..'

13:11.566 --> 13:12.966
'...desperate..'

13:13.033 --> 13:16.866
...two lost souls
on the highway of life.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.100
Let me just explain we--

13:18.166 --> 13:20.933
But every week,
Buzz and I go out on the road..

13:21.000 --> 13:23.966
...lookin' for someone
just like you.

13:24.033 --> 13:26.500
'We get involved
in your life.'

13:27.233 --> 13:29.066
We solve your problems.

13:29.633 --> 13:31.433
We make..

13:31.500 --> 13:33.133
...a difference.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.300
That sounds great.

13:34.366 --> 13:36.000
That, my friends..

13:36.066 --> 13:40.233
...is the philosophy
of the Route 66..

13:40.866 --> 13:43.166
...motor lodge.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.366
- Right, Buzz?
- Right, Todd.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.500
The Honeymoon Suite.

13:58.733 --> 14:00.266
On the house.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.466
Room for one more.

14:13.533 --> 14:14.666
Eh.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.133
Fishy.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.566
Very fishy.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.766
Can you believe this place

14:34.000 --> 14:35.133
I know.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.133
It's so bad it's good.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.733
'Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.'

14:41.366 --> 14:42.733
Well..

14:42.800 --> 14:46.233
...I've decided not to think
about tomorrow until tomorrow.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.066
It's Jacuzzi time.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.366
You know, these pillows..

14:59.433 --> 15:01.166
...are a little heavy
on the lumps.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.066
Hey, there's some kinda
snakes in our bed.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.666
Striped corals.

15:13.733 --> 15:15.466
They're friendly
if you leave them alone.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.833
I don't mean to cause trouble
here, but we're talkin' gross.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.200
Whoa!

15:19.266 --> 15:20.433
You're a grown-up.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.666
You gotta learn
to make your own bed.

15:22.733 --> 15:23.833
Yes.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.366
Oh, yeah.
Don't anybody use that Jacuzzi.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.066
That's were I keep my..

15:30.133 --> 15:31.366
...piranha fish.

15:38.966 --> 15:40.700
'No! Miranda!'

15:44.833 --> 15:47.800
If the real world
doesn't stick it to you..

15:47.866 --> 15:50.633
...it'll probably
eat just you alive.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.833
Miranda!

16:11.066 --> 16:12.033
Rick!

16:12.100 --> 16:13.600
Rick!

16:15.266 --> 16:16.700
Are you okay?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.466
Where's the Jacuzzi?

16:22.033 --> 16:23.500
What Jacuzzi?

16:24.566 --> 16:26.466
There's a sauna
down the hall, but..

16:28.433 --> 16:29.833
Why, don't you remember?

16:29.900 --> 16:32.766
The, the piranhas,
the sinking phone booth..

16:32.833 --> 16:35.633
Uh, getting robbed
by that old couple.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.300
I'm sure glad
I didn't have your dreams.

16:44.266 --> 16:45.200
Wait.

16:45.266 --> 16:47.100
What happened last night?

16:47.866 --> 16:49.200
Are you serious?

16:49.266 --> 16:50.600
Hmm, yeah.

16:52.366 --> 16:54.000
Our car broke down.

16:54.066 --> 16:56.466
We called a tow
and they brought us here.

16:57.866 --> 17:00.266
And you ordered champagne.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.800
...and we celebrated
our elopement.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.066
Sounds great.

17:16.466 --> 17:17.633
But..

17:19.000 --> 17:21.033
...there is one piece
of bad news.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.300
Something you're not gonna like.

17:24.366 --> 17:27.000
Alright. As long as
it doesn't involve fish.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.966
Last night I did some thinking
and I've had a change of heart.

17:35.966 --> 17:37.500
I wanna go back home.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.900
You're kidding me, right?

17:44.833 --> 17:47.900
Running away is not the answer.

17:49.066 --> 17:50.333
'We'll get a place
near our parents'.'

17:50.400 --> 17:53.200
'We'll earn our independence.'

17:53.266 --> 17:55.600
Yeah, but what
about California, huh?

17:55.666 --> 17:58.400
What about livin'
life on the beach?

17:58.466 --> 18:00.166
Livin' in the fun lane?

18:01.500 --> 18:02.800
Pipe dreams.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.866
Miranda..

18:06.933 --> 18:08.466
...we'll be free.

18:08.533 --> 18:10.900
You know, just the two of us..

18:10.966 --> 18:12.733
...livin' our
own lives, remember?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.900
Rick, I love you.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.666
'But let's grow up
one day at a time.'

18:23.000 --> 18:25.933
I don't feel like
diving off the deep end anymore.

18:32.166 --> 18:33.766
Find out how our car is doing.

18:35.433 --> 18:37.000
I'll be in the sauna.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.533
'Deutschland Auto House.'

18:55.600 --> 18:58.100
'If you want your car
zhis morning, forget it.'

18:58.166 --> 19:00.433
'We're tired of servicing
zhe upwardly mobile.'

19:00.500 --> 19:02.066
'Fix it yourself.'

19:02.133 --> 19:04.500
'Rick, come here quick.'

19:04.566 --> 19:05.833
Miranda!

19:08.566 --> 19:10.166
Miranda?

19:10.233 --> 19:12.966
The lock's broke
and it's way too hot in here.

19:13.033 --> 19:14.900
Help me.

19:17.266 --> 19:18.766
Hold on, baby.
I'm goin' for help.

19:18.833 --> 19:21.066
I'm frying in here. Hurry.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.300
Help me!

19:22.366 --> 19:24.233
Somebody!

19:24.300 --> 19:26.933
'Please, hurry! Help me!'

19:29.400 --> 19:32.500
No. Drop the weapon,
tuna breath.

19:32.566 --> 19:34.166
Great. You can help me.
Come on. Sauna door's broken.

19:34.233 --> 19:35.333
'I said drop it.'

19:36.266 --> 19:38.100
Or do you feel lucky today

19:42.733 --> 19:44.700
She'll melt in there.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.900
Up against the wall, whale butt.

19:47.966 --> 19:49.133
No!

19:51.500 --> 19:52.833
She'll die! Let me go!

19:52.900 --> 19:54.866
And you have the right
to remain silent.

19:54.933 --> 19:55.900
So shut up.

19:58.233 --> 20:01.733
We're taking you
to the station, fish bait.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.033
'Somebody, please, help me.'

20:33.466 --> 20:35.366
'Son, I'm just warning ya.'

20:35.433 --> 20:36.600
'You save those stories.'

20:36.666 --> 20:38.733
'We've had just about enough
of your mouth.'

20:38.800 --> 20:40.133
'Please!'

20:40.200 --> 20:42.300
She'll fry!
Don't you hear me?

20:42.366 --> 20:43.966
Hey, hold it down back there.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.666
Yeah, you tell it to the--

20:46.733 --> 20:48.633
Hey!

21:15.233 --> 21:18.033
Miranda! Oh, you got out.
You're okay.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.500
I fixed the lock.

21:19.566 --> 21:21.000
What happened to you?

21:22.500 --> 21:23.733
I'm in real trouble, Miranda.

21:24.733 --> 21:27.566
I killed two cops.

21:27.633 --> 21:29.633
- It's not funny.
- I'm not joking.

21:30.966 --> 21:32.366
Uh, there was a..
There was an accident.

21:32.433 --> 21:34.066
But they're,
they're gonna blame me.

21:35.433 --> 21:37.533
But you were only gone
twenty minutes.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.500
Just come on. There's time
to get out of town, fast.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.433
You can't run from this.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.566
I can run from anything.

21:47.633 --> 21:49.833
Let's just go to California.
We'll change our names.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.033
You're crazy.
You've gotta give yourself up

21:52.100 --> 21:53.200
and explain what happened.

21:53.266 --> 21:55.266
Miranda, please. Come with me.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.333
I love you.

21:57.866 --> 22:00.133
- Where's the car? Come on.
- It's not fixed yet.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.866
Then we gotta run. Come on

22:07.133 --> 22:08.066
Talk to me.

22:08.133 --> 22:09.933
- Say something at least.
- Run!

22:10.000 --> 22:11.166
Tell me how we're gonna
get outta here--

22:11.233 --> 22:12.433
Just run!

22:12.500 --> 22:15.200
Can't we just think
of anything but..

22:15.266 --> 22:17.233
Run! Run! Run!

22:17.300 --> 22:19.266
I can't!

22:23.066 --> 22:24.566
Then we'll ride.

22:25.766 --> 22:26.966
In that.

22:34.666 --> 22:37.000
Why did we
really leave home, Rick?

22:37.966 --> 22:39.633
We were born to ride.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.166
Maybe we were scared.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.800
Of what?

22:46.433 --> 22:48.466
Scared of growing old.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.300
Scared of growing up.

22:51.766 --> 22:53.933
Scared we weren't special.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.500
Shh.

23:07.166 --> 23:10.433
Scared of just
plain stopping, you know?

23:10.500 --> 23:13.800
Looking the real world
in the eye.

23:13.866 --> 23:15.700
I don't know how, Miranda.

23:15.766 --> 23:17.333
Try.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.200
I have tried.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.600
Well, I'm going to stop.

23:25.666 --> 23:27.400
Let me out.

23:27.466 --> 23:29.433
You love me.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.866
'Sure, I love you.'

23:30.933 --> 23:32.800
But running is a cop out.

23:32.866 --> 23:34.333
It's a cheat.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.600
It's a lie.

23:36.933 --> 23:39.633
I'm gonna stand my ground.
I wanna face my fears.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.366
- Let me out.
- No!

23:44.633 --> 23:46.733
I love you.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.633
Then stop running.

23:50.700 --> 23:51.700
I can't!

23:51.766 --> 23:52.833
You can!

23:52.900 --> 23:55.266
I can't! I can't! I can't!

23:55.333 --> 23:56.800
'Do it, Rick. Do it!'

23:56.866 --> 24:00.166
Stop running
before you kill yourself.

24:40.066 --> 24:41.766
Recognize 'em?

24:41.833 --> 24:43.400
Please, don't die, Rick.

24:45.666 --> 24:47.400
Please, don't die.

24:50.533 --> 24:53.200
Help us, for God's sakes!

25:24.700 --> 25:26.433
I guess they just needed a..

25:26.500 --> 25:29.900
...crash coursein growin' u

25:29.966 --> 25:33.100
Cute little birds, aren't they?

25:39.766 --> 25:41.866
Dinner is served.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.733
'Cuckoo!'

26:12.800 --> 26:14.400
'Cuckoo!'

26:14.466 --> 26:16.800
'Real Cuckoo!'

26:16.866 --> 26:19.233
'Ha ha ha!'

26:33.866 --> 26:35.500
Mr. Shore's ready to see you.

26:38.933 --> 26:40.466
And that's about this job.

26:40.533 --> 26:43.333
I never thought I'd find such a
hot place to work in Springwood.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.033
Glad you decided
to stick around.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.400
How's that guy of yours doing?

26:46.466 --> 26:48.966
Much better.
He's fully recovered.

26:49.033 --> 26:50.533
Guess what?

26:50.600 --> 26:53.433
He's the one
who wanted to settle down here.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.833
I'm so proud of him.

26:54.900 --> 26:57.533
No more of running,
we're gonna put down roots

26:57.600 --> 26:59.200
Smart move, Miranda.

26:59.266 --> 27:01.600
You got a future here
at Springwood Records.

27:01.666 --> 27:03.500
You're talented,
you're intelligent.

27:03.566 --> 27:05.033
You put five years
into this company

27:05.100 --> 27:08.566
and you're gonna be
racing in the fast track.

27:08.633 --> 27:11.033
- I'll work like a dog.
- You're gonna have to.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.233
But it'll be worth it.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.100
You're gonna be someone,
Miranda.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.700
All you need
is a 100 percent dedication.

27:20.633 --> 27:22.566
- That reminds me.
- Of what?

27:24.366 --> 27:26.333
Nothing.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.700
Miranda, I'm not just your boss

27:28.766 --> 27:30.300
I'm also your friend.

27:32.533 --> 27:35.833
It's just that I'm a little late
this month, you know.

27:37.466 --> 27:38.866
You're not trying
to get pregnant, are you?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.833
Oh, I'd like
to have babies someday

27:43.900 --> 27:46.733
like, in the year 3006.

27:46.800 --> 27:47.733
Good.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.466
Because motherhood and your job

27:49.533 --> 27:51.433
are definitely incompatible.

28:41.966 --> 28:45.066
Miranda just bought herself
a front-row ticket

28:45.133 --> 28:47.366
to the American dream..

28:47.433 --> 28:49.900
...of her favorite scalper.

29:06.233 --> 29:07.500
Hey..

29:07.566 --> 29:09.533
...if you're pregnant..

29:09.600 --> 29:10.933
...we'll cope.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.766
It's not gun-to-the-head time.

29:12.833 --> 29:14.266
Not for you, maybe.

29:17.066 --> 29:19.133
You're the one who wanted us
to stop running.

29:21.033 --> 29:23.166
A baby, a baby might be great.

29:24.766 --> 29:26.500
Look, if I turn out pregnant

29:26.566 --> 29:28.800
my boss is gonna
pitch me out the door.

29:28.866 --> 29:30.700
Ah!

29:30.766 --> 29:33.433
You really love that job,
don't you, huh?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.566
I love my life.

29:35.633 --> 29:38.100
I'm not ready
to chain myself to a baby.

29:40.766 --> 29:42.366
Not even for me?

29:44.300 --> 29:45.600
Cheap shot.

29:51.733 --> 29:54.200
Hey, come here. Come here.

29:59.633 --> 30:01.166
I'll help you.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.500
We'll be partners.

30:03.566 --> 30:06.400
I can...change the diapers

30:06.466 --> 30:08.400
I'll give it a bath.

30:08.466 --> 30:10.366
What about giving birth to it?

30:10.433 --> 30:11.733
What about breastfeeding it?

30:11.800 --> 30:14.266
What about quitting
your job to raise it?

30:15.900 --> 30:19.500
Rick, I love kids, I really do,
I just don't want them now.

30:19.566 --> 30:21.700
Alright, alright, alright.

30:21.766 --> 30:23.633
Talk about it tomorrow.

30:23.700 --> 30:26.466
Hey, if we have a kid,
your life is gonna be tougher.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.800
I can handle it.

30:27.866 --> 30:29.666
My life is gonna be ruined

30:32.833 --> 30:34.733
I just don't think
it'll be that bad.

30:36.833 --> 30:38.100
Really.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.366
Oh.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.933
I can't believe
this is happening.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.866
Hey, I'm gonna be there for you

31:22.933 --> 31:24.200
through the whole thing

31:24.266 --> 31:26.466
pregnancy, birth, childcare.

31:26.533 --> 31:29.966
I'm pregnant.
I'm really pregnant.

31:30.033 --> 31:31.633
Look, do not worry.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.400
We'll split the work load 50-50

31:33.466 --> 31:34.533
I will not be like other men

31:34.600 --> 31:37.066
I will not flake out on you.

31:37.133 --> 31:40.366
Rick, you don't have to promise.

31:40.433 --> 31:41.766
Just hold me.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.766
Hey, it's big easy, Miranda.

31:44.833 --> 31:46.866
Parenthood's gonna be a breeze.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.700
'You have been cooped up
in that house too long.'

31:52.766 --> 31:56.600
'Why don't we all go out?
Have dinner? See a movie?'

31:56.666 --> 31:58.800
'Come on, you're acting
like your life is over.'

31:58.866 --> 32:00.433
Rick's out again.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.400
He says he's working late.

32:03.466 --> 32:05.700
Secretary, isn't that cute.

32:05.766 --> 32:08.966
At least she doesn't look like
Shamu the whale's big sister.

32:09.033 --> 32:11.433
'Miranda, you don't look bad.'

32:11.500 --> 32:12.766
'You need to go out.'

32:12.833 --> 32:15.033
I'm too fat to have fun.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.533
'Let's go dancing.'

32:16.600 --> 32:18.366
'It'll do you a lot of good.'

32:18.433 --> 32:21.300
Oh, Maggie,
I can't go dancing.

32:21.366 --> 32:23.266
I just don't have
anything that fits.

32:37.233 --> 32:39.300
Oh, Miranda,
I tried to call you.

32:40.100 --> 32:42.100
What's going on?

32:42.166 --> 32:43.333
Who is she?

32:45.000 --> 32:48.700
Like I said, "Motherhood
and your job are incompatible."

32:48.766 --> 32:51.100
You've given her my job?

32:51.166 --> 32:54.633
The law requires that
I offer you maternity leave.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.966
It'll never be the same, you'll
put her on the fast track.

32:58.033 --> 33:01.266
You're the one that chose
to skid off that track, Miranda.

33:01.333 --> 33:02.600
You're the one that chose

33:02.666 --> 33:05.433
to kiss your hopes
and dreams goodbye.

33:09.933 --> 33:11.566
Have a nice childbirth.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.666
Surprise.

33:39.366 --> 33:40.733
What?

33:41.500 --> 33:43.000
What's happening?

33:43.066 --> 33:45.866
Would you, please,
check on little Janey?

33:45.933 --> 33:48.100
I'm late for work.

33:49.533 --> 33:51.800
It's 3:00 a.m.

33:51.866 --> 33:54.733
I know it's 3:00 a.m. Thank you.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.133
This moonlighting is hell

33:56.200 --> 33:58.366
but, since I'm the
bread-winner around here..

33:59.933 --> 34:02.266
Can't you?

34:02.333 --> 34:04.633
Look, I know it's a real drag

34:04.700 --> 34:07.266
traditional sex roles and all.

34:07.333 --> 34:10.133
But for now,
you get to play mommy.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.300
I get to be Mr. Home Security.

34:16.133 --> 34:17.466
Don't go, Rick.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.533
Have to.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.300
Come back to bed.

34:22.366 --> 34:23.933
Make love to me.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.266
We both know sex is impossible.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.066
'Who's got the time?'

34:29.133 --> 34:30.566
'Who has got the energy?'

34:30.633 --> 34:32.166
But I need you.

34:32.233 --> 34:34.733
Look, I think we can
forget about making love

34:34.800 --> 34:36.700
till Janey is at least three.

34:38.633 --> 34:40.233
I'll see you
when I get back.

34:40.300 --> 34:43.233
Rick...don't leave me.

34:45.866 --> 34:48.300
Wait. I'm trapped!

34:49.266 --> 34:51.666
I don't wanna be here!

34:52.133 --> 34:53.133
Aah!

35:23.533 --> 35:26.566
What happened?
Shh! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Shh!

35:26.633 --> 35:28.466
It's okay. It's okay.

35:28.533 --> 35:29.666
It's just a dream.

35:29.733 --> 35:32.833
Hey, shh! It's okay.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.366
It's just a dream.

35:43.500 --> 35:46.366
I'm going to buy one of those
home pregnancy tests today.

35:46.433 --> 35:48.866
'I've got to know.'

35:48.933 --> 35:51.633
Well, how do you feel
about it, any different?

35:51.700 --> 35:54.333
I'm still scared.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.566
But at least now I know
what I'm scared of.

35:58.633 --> 36:00.600
Well, that's good.

36:00.666 --> 36:04.200
I mean I'm 18 years old,
I can handle this.

36:04.266 --> 36:06.300
Even if pregnancy is a drag.

36:06.366 --> 36:08.333
Even if I have to postpone
a career.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.066
Even if you go
all traditional male on me.

36:14.466 --> 36:17.066
The important thing
is to remember..

36:17.133 --> 36:18.933
...that I can do it.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.200
I just have to
believe in myself.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.033
You can, Miranda.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.500
You're tough.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.400
You're gonna buy me
a station wagon?

36:28.466 --> 36:30.700
What?

36:30.766 --> 36:32.633
No, I promise.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.366
No second job?

36:34.433 --> 36:36.466
Mm-mm. Swear.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.066
Always a sex drive.

36:40.233 --> 36:42.466
That'll be the day. Come here.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.300
I'm going to take the test
in the morning.

36:52.666 --> 36:55.700
Whatever comes, I'll be ready.

37:12.233 --> 37:14.333
Fifteen minutes.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.333
Start the countdown.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.633
Miranda Austin.

38:06.700 --> 38:09.100
You're coming with us.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.100
'Straighten up.'

38:14.166 --> 38:15.966
'Face forward.'

38:16.033 --> 38:17.266
Look, this is a mistake.

38:17.333 --> 38:19.733
Get back in line.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.266
Now, doctor,
take your time.

38:31.066 --> 38:32.800
That's her.

38:32.866 --> 38:34.166
'That's the one.'

38:34.233 --> 38:35.333
'Are you sure?'

38:35.400 --> 38:36.733
What did I do?

38:36.800 --> 38:39.900
Yeah. That's her, alright.

38:39.966 --> 38:41.100
She's the one that thought

38:41.166 --> 38:43.500
she was ready to have a child.

38:46.833 --> 38:50.566
We don't believe you, Miranda.

38:50.633 --> 38:52.800
It's not like I planned it.
It was an accident.

38:52.866 --> 38:54.566
I've always been careful,
I swear.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.100
Not careful enough.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.666
This time
you made a big mistake.

38:58.733 --> 39:00.033
Prove it.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.400
Oh, we'll give you proof.

39:02.466 --> 39:04.233
Come on, Miranda, you're 18

39:04.300 --> 39:06.266
you really think
you'd be a good mother?

39:06.333 --> 39:08.433
I'll give it my best shot.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
Motherhood takes commitment.

39:10.566 --> 39:12.833
Motherhood takes guts.

39:12.900 --> 39:16.700
I don't think you have
what it takes.

39:16.766 --> 39:18.433
What do you know?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.866
Listen I got straight As
in high school.

39:22.866 --> 39:24.733
You're selfish, Miranda.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.733
And you are out of your league.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.700
Look..

39:29.766 --> 39:31.633
...what is the big deal?

39:32.966 --> 39:36.200
Motherhood can be dull.
A rut, a grime..

39:36.266 --> 39:38.866
You look more like
a party girl to me.

39:38.933 --> 39:40.533
That's enough!

39:40.600 --> 39:44.433
Motherhood is the most
thankless job in America.

39:44.500 --> 39:47.633
Pain, frustration, worry.

39:49.433 --> 39:52.566
Flakes like you
make me sick, Miranda.

39:52.633 --> 39:55.200
You don't deserve
to be a mother.

39:58.433 --> 40:00.566
Fasten your seat belt, kid

40:00.633 --> 40:04.066
You're about to pay the price.

40:06.066 --> 40:07.400
No!

40:20.266 --> 40:22.766
I'm tired.
I'm fed up.

40:22.833 --> 40:25.266
I can't take this anymore.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.833
This is torture.

40:26.900 --> 40:30.633
Gee whiz,
look who's tired.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.633
Aren't you enjoying
our postpartum

40:32.700 --> 40:36.200
sleep deprivation camp
for unprepared mother.

40:36.266 --> 40:37.500
You're cruel.

40:37.566 --> 40:39.033
You're sick!

40:39.100 --> 40:41.766
Just think,
no sleep for days.

40:41.833 --> 40:42.966
For weeks.

40:43.033 --> 40:45.066
For years.

40:45.133 --> 40:47.466
Oh, I can't take this!

40:49.266 --> 40:50.266
Oh!

40:56.600 --> 40:59.000
Well, you can forget
about friends, Miranda.

40:59.066 --> 41:01.200
You won't have time
to call them.

41:01.266 --> 41:03.900
In fact,
you won't have time for fun.

41:03.966 --> 41:06.000
Any fun.

41:06.066 --> 41:07.333
'Stop it!'

41:07.400 --> 41:10.000
Oh, come on,
you're a mother now.

41:11.533 --> 41:14.400
Please, stop.

41:19.633 --> 41:21.266
What's your name?

41:21.333 --> 41:23.900
Well, I'm not sleeping beauty.

41:23.966 --> 41:27.033
Don't play games with me,
what's your name?

41:27.100 --> 41:30.100
Miranda Austin.

41:30.166 --> 41:31.766
Wrong!

41:31.833 --> 41:33.000
I am.

41:33.066 --> 41:34.700
I'm Miranda Austin!

41:34.766 --> 41:35.833
Not anymore.

41:35.900 --> 41:38.033
You're little Janey's mommy.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.866
You're Mrs. Austin.

41:39.933 --> 41:42.800
PTA mom, den mother,
America's favorite homemaker..

41:42.866 --> 41:44.433
Now, stop it!

41:44.500 --> 41:46.600
You've given birth
to your own replacement.

41:46.666 --> 41:49.566
Might as well
put a gun to your head.

42:23.533 --> 42:25.433
Janey?

42:25.500 --> 42:30.033
Is little Janey-Waney
finally sleepy-weepy?

42:30.100 --> 42:33.700
You know you're mommy's
pride and joy.

42:34.766 --> 42:36.133
And the only reason

42:36.200 --> 42:39.633
mommy's able to live
through this nightmare.

42:48.466 --> 42:50.666
I don't remember buying that.

42:52.266 --> 42:54.200
Hey!
Who's there?

42:54.266 --> 42:56.133
Who's there?
Who are you?

43:02.066 --> 43:04.233
Janey, we gotta get out of here.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.200
Where's my baby?

43:22.733 --> 43:23.966
'Miranda?'

43:25.966 --> 43:28.533
Thank God.
Rick, help me.

43:29.766 --> 43:31.266
That's why we're here.

43:31.333 --> 43:33.800
We heard you couldn't sleep,
little girl.

43:33.866 --> 43:36.666
So we thought
we'd sing you a lullaby.

43:36.733 --> 43:38.266
Hit it, gang.

44:19.833 --> 44:21.333
The test..

44:32.566 --> 44:36.333
Rick! Rick! I took a test,
I'm not pregnant.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.033
Then come home.
We'll celebrate.

44:38.100 --> 44:39.833
I love you.

44:42.466 --> 44:44.466
I got a chance a new life.

44:44.533 --> 44:45.633
Oh.

44:45.700 --> 44:48.366
So much
for my biological clock.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.733
You better brace yourself.

45:11.633 --> 45:14.200
How could this happen?

45:14.266 --> 45:17.600
Her brain scans show
all sorts of anomalies.

45:19.400 --> 45:21.666
- But this..
- Let me be straight with you.

45:23.033 --> 45:25.966
I think it's some sort
of psychological component

45:29.133 --> 45:32.033
So, what are you telling me,
doctor?

45:32.100 --> 45:34.966
It's not the hit on the head?
That she's gone crazy, what?

45:35.033 --> 45:36.466
I'm not so sure.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.033
Right now Ithink
she may be a child

45:41.100 --> 45:42.700
for the rest of the life.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.600
Aww..

46:11.533 --> 46:13.400
She took a lickin'.

46:13.466 --> 46:16.366
But she kept on tickin'.

46:18.666 --> 46:20.133
Cuckoo.

46:22.700 --> 46:24.533
Cuckoo.

46:26.733 --> 46:28.300
Cuckoo.
