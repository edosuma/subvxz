15:02.335 --> 15:04.670
All the boys kind of got
left behind.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.407
And I remember
it was, like, twilight.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.076
Like, it was starting to get
really dark.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.912
And there were, like,
hundreds of fireflies.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.847
‐ Yeah.
‐ [laughs]

15:14.914 --> 15:17.784
And of course, like,
me being the kid that I was,

15:17.850 --> 15:21.421
I was like, "Let's squish them
on our faces so we can glow."

15:21.487 --> 15:22.722
[laughs]

15:22.789 --> 15:24.424
And so we did
and it was really gross.

15:24.490 --> 15:28.194

to, like, glow.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.429
‐ [laughs]

a firefly,

15:32.865 --> 15:35.701
I just, like, take a second
and think of her.

1:01:58.515 --> 1:01:59.816
It is a little bit chilly
though,

1:01:59.883 --> 1:02:01.651

my seat warm later.

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.753

You obviously have

Mara, I'm so glad

Mara introduces herself as
"Mara like marinara sauce."

She likes to say
she's so saucy.

1:02:32.315 --> 1:02:34.884
But it's only because
she hydrates with tequila,

1:02:34.951 --> 1:02:36.186
like most cougars do.

1:02:39.356 --> 1:02:42.659
She has a loyalty membership
at Baby Gap,

1:02:42.726 --> 1:02:46.963
which is ironic because she has
an adult gap between her teeth.

1:02:47.030 --> 1:02:48.265

you're already engaged.

1:03:06.950 --> 1:03:08.752
But, honestly,
if I were 13 years old,

1:03:08.818 --> 1:03:10.787
I'd be acting the same way.

1:03:10.854 --> 1:03:12.689
But honestly, Clayton,
if you end up with her,

1:03:12.756 --> 1:03:14.090
give me a call
whenever you need a babysitter.

1:03:41.885 --> 1:03:44.387

Also, no need for a helmet.
