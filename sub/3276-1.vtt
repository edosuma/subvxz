<i>- Tell John to come.</i>
<i>- John, please! John!</i>

00:51.285 --> 00:52.351
<i>He won't come for you!</i>

<i>Please! Please! Please!</i>

<i>he's not coming!</i>

01:13.574 --> 01:15.254
<i>Why isn't he coming?</i>
<i>He doesn't love you.</i>

01:15.576 --> 01:18.744
<i>Please, John.</i>
<i>Bitch, you're all done.</i>

01:18.746 --> 01:21.180

<i>No!</i>

01:31.592 --> 01:33.258
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

02:03.790 --> 02:06.825
Three out. Arm the charge.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.530
Don't blow your
balls off, okay.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.532
Hey, don't worry.
They're made of brass.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.167
Are they as big as your wife's?

02:17.904 --> 02:20.205
Who the fuck dropped ass?

02:20.207 --> 02:23.208
That was me.
Better check your
fucking drawers.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.710
I think that was brisket,
wasn't it?
Wasn't that brisket?

02:24.712 --> 02:29.915
- Hey, shut the fuck up!
- Concentrate! It's payday.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.931
Hell, yeah.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.169
Look at you.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.179
Done a roll call?

03:00.181 --> 03:01.861
Breacher and his men
are all accounted for.

03:02.715 --> 03:03.916
How much is in there?

03:03.918 --> 03:05.684
We're about to find out.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.653
DC will be very happy.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.254
<i>Okay, be ready.</i>

03:09.256 --> 03:10.589
<i> Acknowledge.</i>

03:10.591 --> 03:11.823
<i> Roger.</i>

03:30.443 --> 03:33.946
Fuck that! No!
I'm going to hit
you fucking raw.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.215
Okay. Come here, baby!

03:36.983 --> 03:38.550
Come on.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.919
All right, come on.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.856
Lizzy, radio check.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.625
Do you copy me?

03:47.360 --> 03:48.961
I hear nothing!

03:48.963 --> 03:50.429
What are you talking about?

03:50.431 --> 03:53.498
I can only hear your
heartbeat. Come on!

03:54.702 --> 03:57.336
God damn it, lizzy!
Do you copy me?

03:57.338 --> 03:58.937
Bad call, boss, sending her in.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.706
Oh, relax.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.774
She knows how to take
care of her business.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.014
I got movement.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.482
Second story, front window.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.654
Center lock.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.255
I'm taking the shot.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.519
Here we go!
Let's move, let's move!

04:38.278 --> 04:39.958
Come on! Move it!
Stack it up. Stack it up.

04:44.817 --> 04:45.951
<i> Puta!</i>

04:47.321 --> 04:49.855
Shots fired.
Delta side.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.491
Neck,
stay close with me!
Already out!

04:52.493 --> 04:55.027
Hey! Hey, where's my shit?
I'm going in!

04:55.029 --> 04:57.062
You're not going in!
I know where the money is!
Do you?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.830
Let's go long!

04:58.832 --> 05:01.566
Fuck, lizzy!
You look hot, baby! Whoo!

05:01.568 --> 05:03.001
Stack up.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.303
Pyro,
get the window!
On it.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.705
Let's go.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.911
Tripod, clear.

05:13.546 --> 05:14.546
Breach. Breach!

05:16.883 --> 05:18.383
Get in there!
Move it!

05:18.385 --> 05:20.385
- I got high!
- Okay, I got back!

05:20.387 --> 05:21.653
Come on, y'all!

05:21.655 --> 05:22.854
Clear right!

05:22.856 --> 05:25.824
<i>Lizzy, there's a fucking gate!</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.759
No shit. Take this.
Got it.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.992
- Anybody hurt?
- I'm good.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.642
Tripod! Demo!

05:43.644 --> 05:45.043
Aw, shit,
I think I broke a nail.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.646
Double up!
Give me the charge.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.608
What are
we doing, boss?
Demo set.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.884
Three, two, one!

05:55.689 --> 05:56.929
Pyro,
shoot the fucker!

05:58.658 --> 06:00.025
Target down!
Good shot!
Dead.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.426
Get moving!

06:01.428 --> 06:03.595
- Breaching shotgun!
- Pop it!

06:05.631 --> 06:06.765
Move it!

06:06.767 --> 06:07.699
Lizzy,
where's the money?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.568
Down that hall.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.891
Spider hole
in the ceiling.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.774
Target down!
Move it!

06:15.776 --> 06:17.008
- Watch your head.
- Good shot.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.477
- Popped his gray.
- Meat shower.

06:18.911 --> 06:20.011
Target.

06:21.581 --> 06:22.942
- Down!
- Let's move!

06:26.085 --> 06:27.753
Saw shit
like this in Iraq.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.954
Door is on the right.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.022
Stand clear!

06:31.024 --> 06:33.158
Moving up.
Everyone, get out
of my fucking way!

06:36.396 --> 06:37.757
Kick it,
tripod, let's go!

06:41.100 --> 06:42.434
- Keep it tight!
- I'll take the back.

06:42.436 --> 06:46.004
- Cover your sides!
- You got it, boss!

06:47.039 --> 06:48.573
Clear.
Let's move.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.475
Clear. Clear.
Move it up.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.844
Look what
mama did for you.

06:52.846 --> 06:57.149
Holy shit.
Uncle Sam gets his.
It's time to get ours.

06:57.151 --> 07:00.152
Come on, kids,
let's get paid.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.653
I guess you blew
the right scumbag.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.888
I guess I did.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.791
You're going
to make me sick.
Let's go.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.892
Come on, monster, let's go!

07:06.894 --> 07:08.093
On it, boss.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.095
Neck!
Bags, some rope!

07:10.097 --> 07:11.763
Yeah. Bags over here.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.165
Rope, bags!

07:13.167 --> 07:14.733
We've got
three minutes.
Rope!

07:14.735 --> 07:17.202
Smoke, cut that shit!

07:17.204 --> 07:19.070
Really? Really?

07:22.675 --> 07:25.644
<i>Breacher, it's watcher.</i>
<i>What's the delay?</i>

07:25.646 --> 07:27.813
Well, we're cutting
through an obstacle, sir.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.848
<i>It's going to</i>
<i>take a while.</i>
Roger that.

07:29.850 --> 07:34.586
<i>Need any help?</i>
Negative.
We have active shooters.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.789
<i>So just hold back</i>
<i>until it's all clear.</i>

07:37.791 --> 07:39.224
Who wipes their ass
and puts the toilet paper

07:39.226 --> 07:41.526
on the outside of
the fucking bowl?

07:41.528 --> 07:43.762
Hey, get the water
line off the toilet.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.664
- Hurry the fuck up!
- We're working on it.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.233
Today, monster.
Come on,
hurry up, guys. Let's go.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.868
Incoming.
Three, two...

07:52.105 --> 07:53.205
Two Mikes and we're through.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.740
Two minutes.
Oh, God!

07:55.742 --> 07:57.008
What's taking you
so fucking long?
Go, go, go.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.610
Let's go,
I want more money.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.213
You're getting somewhere now.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.547
Here you go, babe.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.586
Fuck!

08:08.154 --> 08:09.621
- Fuck!
- What happened?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.189
- Man down!
- Who's down?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.724
Smoke's been hit!

08:12.726 --> 08:16.094
<i> Smoke Jennings</i>
<i>is down! Taking fire!</i>
Son of a bitch!

08:16.096 --> 08:18.063
Medical, stand by.
We may have a problem.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.266
Get his head down.
<i> Get your man</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

08:21.268 --> 08:22.901
Tripod, get in the rig!
Stay with me.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.264
Got it!
Monster,
hurry up.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.539
Monster!
Let's go.
We need more money!

08:27.541 --> 08:29.040
Breacher, the dude's fucked up!

08:29.042 --> 08:30.141
Not getting paid
ain't gonna help him.

08:30.143 --> 08:34.679
Shut your fucking mouth!
This isn't what
we fucking do!

08:34.681 --> 08:35.780
I'll take your cut.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.816
Shut the fuck up!
Do your job!

08:37.818 --> 08:40.519
Hang in there.
Just a little hickey, baby.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.721
Keep the
money coming!

08:42.922 --> 08:45.757
Come on, breacher.
Come on, come on, come on.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.626
- One Mike!
- Fuck, open your eyes!

08:47.628 --> 08:49.628
- How's he doing?
- He's cleaned up.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.264
We gotta move him, boss!
Get him out of here now.
Get him up.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.899
A little help, grinder!

08:53.901 --> 08:54.900
<i> Breacher?</i>
<i>Breacher, give me status.</i>

08:54.902 --> 08:56.301
Stand by.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.105
I have men coming out.
Call up medical.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.740
<i> Are you</i>
<i>in the money room?</i>

09:01.742 --> 09:03.174
Let's go!

09:03.176 --> 09:04.943
Come on, come on.
Get some more, get some more.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.244
Lizzy,
how much money do we got?

09:06.246 --> 09:07.879
About $10 million.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.715
That's enough.
Go and help monster.
On it!

09:10.717 --> 09:12.817
Okay, tripod.
Moving.
<i> John.</i>

09:12.819 --> 09:14.180
Come on,
come on, come on.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.222
Moving it in.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.590
Last spark.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.661
- It's in. It's in.
- Go, go, go! Move!

09:22.663 --> 09:24.696
<i> God damn it, John!</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>

09:24.698 --> 09:27.132
We're through.
All right, stack up.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.568
Team, move.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.131
Monster, stay left.
Heads on the swivel.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.272
Coming out.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.734
All right,
who dropped ass?

10:02.736 --> 10:03.935
Holy shit!

10:05.105 --> 10:06.271
Fuck!

10:07.974 --> 10:09.207
Stop splashing!

10:09.209 --> 10:10.375
Here we go.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.278
Come on, boys.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.679
This better
be worth it!

10:14.681 --> 10:16.121
Fucking nasty.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.188
Fuck.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.056
- Shit.
- What?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.258
Where's the
fucking money?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.960
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.763
- What'd she say?
- Check in the water.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.165
What the fuck you mean,
check the water?

10:34.167 --> 10:35.367
Right behind you.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.235
What happened
with the money?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.404
What do you mean
there's no fucking money?

10:39.406 --> 10:41.740
Look at the rope.

10:41.742 --> 10:45.276
Just check down there.
Check down here.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.278
Oh, fucking shit.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.847
Who the fuck else
knew about this shit?

10:48.849 --> 10:52.283
It's not in
the fucking water, man!
It's not in the fucking water!

10:52.285 --> 10:53.752
No fucking way!

10:53.754 --> 10:57.656
Why don't you all just
shut the fuck up and let's go?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.760
Hold up, you guys.
Hold up.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.262
What the fuck is that?

11:04.698 --> 11:07.666
We just wasted
our whole fucking career

11:07.668 --> 11:09.100
for this shit and
there's nothing here?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.301
This ain't good.
Let's walk.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.836
Check the water.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.005
We sold ourselves out for this.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.787
<i> We got a little problem.</i>

11:28.789 --> 11:32.023
$10 million is missing.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.426
Now listen.
You all did a
fine job in there.

11:34.428 --> 11:38.430
We're not arguing that
you've got a good
record with the DEA.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.398
None of that matters right now,

11:40.400 --> 11:44.069
'cause all we need to do
is find out where
that $10 million is.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.837
And that's why you're here.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.939
It was a big, giant
fucking stack of money.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.702
How do you know,
exactly down to the dollar,
how much was in that room?

11:51.310 --> 11:52.811
Well, the FBI was

11:52.813 --> 11:54.913
carrying on
a parallel investigation.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.781
Did you ever see
the $200 million?

11:56.783 --> 12:00.018
Did you guys hear me
say I want my lawyer?

12:00.020 --> 12:03.188
You know what
would clear your ass?
If you'd take a polygraph.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.724
No poly.
No poly?

12:05.726 --> 12:08.426
That's weak.
That's sad.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.794
Your ass is going to prison.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.932
When money is
supposed to be there
and it goes away,

12:13.934 --> 12:15.467
and it looks like to us,
it was a setup.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.969
It may not be,
and we're going
to find out.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.105
And I know you had
a friend who died.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.440
And that's awful,
and it's going
to be more awful

12:22.442 --> 12:23.908
if it was because of money.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.377
My friend did not die
for fucking $10 million.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.114
We lost a man,
we lost a brother.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.556
And you don't give
a shit about that.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.786
It was
wharton's idea,
wasn't it?

12:34.788 --> 12:37.422
You were just
following the lead
of a respected supervisor.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.290
I mean, John is like your daddy.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.092
You were doing
what you had to do.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.928
Fuck you.
You don't know my daddy.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.965
This agency saved your ass.
You were going nowhere.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.067
You were a question
mark coming in here.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.103
And you have been better
than any of us ever dreamed.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.938
And you've always outperformed.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.074
We're trying to
save that career.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.176
This is
your family, Joe.
This is your family.

13:00.479 --> 13:04.015
See, I'm not a thief.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.185
If that cartel finds out that
you took $10 million,

13:08.921 --> 13:11.823
they're going to
slit your throat
from ear to ear.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.108
I gotta pee, man.

14:05.277 --> 14:06.411
Say what?
I gotta piss.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.046
Then go pee.

14:08.048 --> 14:11.282
Man, he got cameras all over.
There's no way I can go.

14:12.251 --> 14:13.952
Oh, dude, really?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.187
Piss, man. What the hell?
What you think?

14:16.189 --> 14:19.424
Where your dick
been sticking in, man.
I ain't putting it in there.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.559
Yeah, the problem is,
your shit probably
fit in there.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.329
My shit don't fit in there.
I need a thermos or some shit.
Look at this.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.231
You threw a bottle
of piss in my lap.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.233
Man, it's got
a cap on it.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.601
Morning, breach.
Morning.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.936
Hey, good morning.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.105
Oh, man, thanks, breach!

14:34.107 --> 14:35.273
Breakfast of champions, huh?

14:35.275 --> 14:38.109
Here's your DVD, man.
Appreciate it.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.879
And don't piss in
my bushes anymore, okay?

14:40.881 --> 14:43.581
I have a surveillance camera.
I see it all.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.250
No, that was him.
I've got a bottle.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.123
I ain't sticking my dick
nowhere your dick
has been, damn that.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.591
You didn't say
that about Rebecca.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.426
When you fuck Rebecca?

14:55.428 --> 14:57.128
I fuck them all.
Bro.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.364
Just follow that truck.
I'm gonna deal with you.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.986
I don't know if
he did it. I just know I hear
stuff, that's all I'm saying.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.688
They're looking for something.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.157
Or else we wouldn't
be following him
around like this.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.292
Yeah.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.602
Why don't you just
pull the pin on this?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.472
You're never going
to be able to spend
that blood money anyway.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.573
Do it for your team.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.275
Do it for your country.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.245
Do it for yourself.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.748
Retire. End it.
End the pain.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.386
Fuck you, breacher.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.061
I hate it as much
as you do, sir.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.076
Tactical God.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.111
Why don't you wash
your fucking hands?

17:29.748 --> 17:32.116
That's a new suit?

17:32.118 --> 17:36.054
Why do you rock
that off-the-rack,
cheap-ass jcpenney shit

17:36.056 --> 17:38.089
when you can afford Armani?

17:38.091 --> 17:39.757
In fact, why aren't you
on a yacht in the Caymans?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.526
I know what you're trying to do.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.128
The jabs, the jokes.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.665
But tell them
I'm not going to bite.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.301
What'd you tell
smoke Jennings' wife?

17:50.303 --> 17:52.637
That he died
for a good cause,
making you rich?

17:55.174 --> 17:57.241
Tell them you let me disarm you.

17:59.278 --> 18:00.678
Give me the fucking gun.

18:26.138 --> 18:27.738
Come in.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.409
Have a seat, John.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.286
It's over.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.256
I'll go and clean out my desk.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.691
I'm not firing you.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.759
The investigation is over.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.328
No one's been exonerated.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.131
DC just lost their appetite.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.368
Who do you know
in Washington, John?

18:57.370 --> 19:00.138
Got a picture of a senator
fucking a goat, maybe?

19:03.876 --> 19:07.145
The only thing anyone
in law enforcement has
is their credibility.

19:07.147 --> 19:11.149
It's like virginity.
Once it's gone,
it's gone forever.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.851
When did you lose yours?

19:20.893 --> 19:23.261
What if I gave you
your team back?

19:24.530 --> 19:26.664
Don't fuck with me.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.167
No one wants you, John.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.902
I've got nowhere
else to stick you.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.671
Mind showing some
leadership this time?

19:36.608 --> 19:37.708
Gun.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.843
Badge.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.579
Creds.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.549
There you go.
You're back in the game.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.839
They don't
fucking let us train.
They don't let us shoot.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.908
I mean, I can't even
carry a fucking
gun in here, dude.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.777
We're sitting on
our asses, rotting.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.579
It's punishment, bro.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.480
Don't let it get in your head.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.316
Just deal with it. I am.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.817
Who's winning?
Get down.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.720
Get the fuck out of the way!

20:22.722 --> 20:24.722
In the middle of
my goddamn game!
Fuck me!

20:24.724 --> 20:26.657
Country-ass motherfucker!

20:26.659 --> 20:29.327
Why you acting all
Jethro on that shit?
You gonna play?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.562
We're reduced
to a fucking rubber
gun squad, bro,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.397
I feel like a fucking parolee.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.666
Why is he tattooing a dick
on your back, pyro?

20:35.668 --> 20:37.935
You know what, bro,
this is a fallen soldier.
Fuck you, man.

20:37.937 --> 20:38.936
Will you fucking dial it down?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.571
I just lost a buddy down range!

20:40.573 --> 20:42.840
Easy, easy,
killer. Hell!

20:44.410 --> 20:46.244
It does kind
of look like a dick.

20:48.347 --> 20:49.513
The expert has spoken.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.582
Bro, if I turn around

20:51.584 --> 20:53.784
and see a fucking dick
in the mirror, you're dead.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.553
It doesn't look like a dick.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.954
Get off my ass, man!

20:56.956 --> 20:58.723
You might wanna
listen to this.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.495
It's a fucking
piece of shit.
Fuck you.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.565
'Cause all
the company she keeps
is rubbing off on her.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.433
All the fucking
piece-of-shit-ness...

21:09.435 --> 21:11.602
Man, you need
a Xanax or something.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.938
Why don't you
go home and fuck
your mama again?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.674
Come on, man.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.477
You were slightly
amusing in the field.
Here, you just suck.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.779
I will out-fight,
out-fuck

21:21.781 --> 21:23.881
and out-work you
on my worst day.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.016
See, I don't
wanna fuck you, lizzy.

21:25.018 --> 21:27.351
Crack whores are not my thing.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.620
Hey! That's my wife, yeah?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.990
Bro, you bought a fucking cow
when the milk was free.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.360
Let's do it, pussy.
Come on, let's go bareback.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.462
Wear a mouthpiece
and head guard
if you want.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.865
I'll still fucking
dismantle you!

21:42.334 --> 21:43.801
Okay, now I want to fuck her.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.407
Out cold, bitch!

21:50.542 --> 21:52.643
- She got you.
- Yo!

21:54.047 --> 21:56.013
What the fuck is going on here?

22:01.420 --> 22:03.654
This place looks like
a fucking crack house!

22:03.656 --> 22:06.791
You shouldn't be here.
What are you doing here?

22:06.793 --> 22:09.060
The investigation is over.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.529
- We're back in business!
- No shit?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.364
Yes!
Whoo!

22:13.366 --> 22:14.732
Here are
your credentials.
Fucking finally!

22:14.734 --> 22:16.634
Whoo! Gimme!

22:16.636 --> 22:18.636
How'd you
manage this, boss?
Ain't that pretty?

22:18.638 --> 22:22.106
I told you!
I told you motherfuckers!

22:22.108 --> 22:23.741
- And you, put a shirt on.
- Here we go.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.543
You're just jealous.

22:25.545 --> 22:26.811
Good to
have you back, boss.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.079
Is that a dick?

22:28.081 --> 22:30.414
Dude!

22:30.416 --> 22:32.617
It's a self-portrait!
Where's the fucking mirror?

22:33.085 --> 22:34.352
It's not done.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.388
Let's go!

22:39.458 --> 22:40.458
Morning, boss.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.696
Morning!
Boss!

22:46.965 --> 22:48.666
Morning, daddy.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.734
Good to be back.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.702
What took you so fucking long?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.537
I'm embarrassed
you don't have decent shit.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.739
Who's got coffee?

22:54.741 --> 22:56.140
Knock the dust off!

23:05.016 --> 23:07.818
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:07.820 --> 23:10.521
You promised you'd
use the down time
to work on yourself.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.090
I'm fine.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.596
Give me the weapon.

23:18.598 --> 23:19.797
No.

23:19.799 --> 23:20.865
I can train...
Lizzy.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.000
Breacher.
I'm training.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.772
Why don't you go play daddy
somewhere else, huh?

23:33.745 --> 23:35.546
Come on.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.881
Slow the fuck down!

23:36.883 --> 23:38.582
Shut the fuck up!

23:38.584 --> 23:41.051
- Hurry the fuck up!
- You're moving too fast.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.620
- Sweetheart, shut up!
- So slow.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.488
You need to skinny up,
motherfucker.

23:44.490 --> 23:45.856
Get that chicken wing
out of the way.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.124
Fucking get in your own Lane.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.560
Y'all seriously
taking giant-ass steps.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.862
Give me room.
Give me room!

23:51.864 --> 23:53.497
Little room.
Little room!

23:53.665 --> 23:55.099
Contact right!

23:56.835 --> 23:57.935
Hi! We're home!

23:59.004 --> 24:00.504
Thank you!

24:00.506 --> 24:02.907
Slowest fucking pie
I've ever seen in my life.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.108
Whenever you're ready!

24:04.110 --> 24:05.776
Come on,
open the door, let's go!

24:05.778 --> 24:07.778
Make a decision!

24:07.780 --> 24:10.548
All fucking day.
Let me pie this fucking door.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.630
If there's pussy in there,
you'd already be in there.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.052
- It won't kick itself.
- Punch it!

24:15.054 --> 24:16.654
Breaching
the fucking door!

24:19.558 --> 24:20.658
What the fuck
are you doing?

24:20.660 --> 24:24.161
First in the room?
That's the way to
wait for the team there.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.996
Very nice. Very nice.
That's not how
you fucking do it.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.032
You going to get in
my fucking way every time?

24:28.034 --> 24:30.501
All right, secure from exercise!

24:32.204 --> 24:33.637
This one is down.

24:33.639 --> 24:34.639
Yeah, I got him.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.911
What about him?
Fuck!

24:40.913 --> 24:42.880
And who is that?
Somebody's got to dig
that fucking corner.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.582
No shit!

24:44.584 --> 24:45.916
Yeah,
second guy in the room.
It was you!

24:45.918 --> 24:47.184
I was number three!
You got this guy.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.652
That's your
fucking corner!
Be quiet.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.553
He's dead!
I was
third one through!

24:49.555 --> 24:52.256
You should have
dug the corner.
Shut up!

24:52.258 --> 24:54.758
Shut up. Grinder.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.494
You have to take that corner.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.828
You breached.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.197
You immediately turn
and you go for it.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.033
That's your responsibility,
and you cover that corner.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.835
There's no argument here,
so let's run it again.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.170
- Fucking asshole.
- Told you.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.538
Come on, guys.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.610
Fuck it!
Why don't I run
it by myself?

25:12.612 --> 25:14.044
I'll show you
fuckers how to do it!

25:14.046 --> 25:15.513
Oh, fuck off!

25:19.718 --> 25:23.654
So what happened?
You used to be
good at this.

25:23.656 --> 25:27.525
Yeah, well,
six months of finger pointing
and recrimination happened.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.093
You weren't around.
You didn't have our backs.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.061
Well, not by choice.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.063
That's your fucking excuse?

25:33.065 --> 25:35.032
When did you ever
listen to the rules?

25:41.172 --> 25:42.873
We're not a team anymore.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.876
Just a gang.

25:49.581 --> 25:52.750
And there is no trust.
There is no trust.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.558
We're going to
get it back. I know.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.627
We're still a family.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.664
Yeah, I wish
I could believe you.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.074
So now we don't
trust each other?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.209
In what we do,
there is only trust.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.645
I trust you!

26:23.248 --> 26:25.616
Each and every one of you.

26:28.153 --> 26:30.888
With my life.

26:30.890 --> 26:34.258
And I'll prove it to you.
Kick the door.

26:35.226 --> 26:38.696
Kill the bad guys.
Don't kill me.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.769
What the fuck
did you say to him?

27:05.056 --> 27:06.223
Target!

27:23.808 --> 27:24.808
How did we do, boss?

27:26.111 --> 27:28.112
Good. Good job.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.213
I guess we don't suck.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.250
It's time to do the lord's work.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.130
Shots! Beers! Come on!

27:46.132 --> 27:47.398
All right,
who's gonna get this round?

27:50.402 --> 27:51.969
I'll get the fucking round!

27:53.004 --> 27:54.805
Why they call you pyro, honey?

27:54.807 --> 27:57.174
'Cause I hooked a flashbang
in a meth lab,

27:57.176 --> 27:59.143
burned down
the whole fucking
apartment building.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.413
That's why
we don't let him have
the bangs no more.

28:02.415 --> 28:04.448
You about burned my
ass up, you bastard.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.017
We call him pyro
'cause his ass burns.

28:11.456 --> 28:13.123
Yeah, whatever, asshole.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.324
Get of here.
Get out of here.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.427
I would hit that.
Fuck yeah!

28:16.429 --> 28:18.796
To lizzy,
my favorite evil bitch.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.831
Evil bitch!

28:23.201 --> 28:24.435
Let's drink to smoke Jennings.

28:26.171 --> 28:28.205
That motherfucker
died for our sins.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.306
Fuck yeah.

28:29.308 --> 28:30.441
Smoke Jennings!
Smoke!

28:30.443 --> 28:31.875
Smoke!
Smoke!

28:31.877 --> 28:33.343
Yeah!
Smoke!

28:33.345 --> 28:35.045
This is one
for the homie that
can't be here.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.113
Smoke Jennings.

28:48.827 --> 28:50.360
You know, we missed you.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.865
You're the heart and soul of us.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.234
Don't ever forget that.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.871
They almost won.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.341
It's fucking bullshit
and you know it.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.411
We're here, aren't we?

29:09.047 --> 29:11.915
We held out

29:11.917 --> 29:13.784
as a team.

29:17.856 --> 29:21.792
It's just that,
that thing that we did

29:21.794 --> 29:22.960
was for nothing.

29:28.066 --> 29:30.768
Let it go.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.302
You hear me?

29:33.204 --> 29:34.905
Let it go.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.807
Okay.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.915
You know what?
I can do this shit
better than all y'all.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.253
Get the fuck
off the stage!

29:49.255 --> 29:51.388
Get the fuck off the stage!

29:51.390 --> 29:52.990
Relax!

29:52.992 --> 29:54.525
Let's go, motherfucker!

29:54.527 --> 29:56.193
Get the fuck back!

29:59.265 --> 30:03.567
All right, let's go.
We gotta roll,
we gotta roll!

30:03.569 --> 30:05.569
Whoo!

30:05.571 --> 30:10.507
Have a nice night!
Son of a bitch
with a weak-ass right.

31:04.329 --> 31:05.896
Fuck!

31:10.935 --> 31:12.536
What the fuck?

31:15.907 --> 31:16.907
What the fuck?

31:17.475 --> 31:20.177
No! What the fuck?

31:21.079 --> 31:23.914
Fuck! Fuck!

32:35.053 --> 32:36.119
Miss.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.287
Hi.

32:39.357 --> 32:40.357
Tom worked for me.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.228
John wharton.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.998
Caroline brentwood.
Homicide.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.666
Can you help me
with next of kin?

32:49.668 --> 32:51.601
There's some ex-wives.

32:54.072 --> 32:56.073
So, what happened here?

32:56.075 --> 32:58.175
Train versus winnebago.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.609
Train won.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.411
So why is homicide involved?

33:01.413 --> 33:04.748
Well, some sucker's
got to write it up.
Guess that's me.

33:10.521 --> 33:12.756
Anything else I can do?

33:12.758 --> 33:14.257
Start sweeping for body parts.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.694
Caroline, hey,
I found the torso.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.496
Coming to you!

33:26.704 --> 33:28.438
Oh, geez.

33:29.707 --> 33:31.174
Look at this.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.011
You can smell
the alcohol from here.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.346
Yeah, right.

33:44.555 --> 33:46.556
Your man's been drinking.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.426
We did have a team celebration.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.262
As soon as I get
this place locked down,

33:52.264 --> 33:54.131
I need a statement from you.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.706
You know who that is, right?

34:02.708 --> 34:06.343
Some fed who thinks
his shit don't stink.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.711
That's John wharton.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.181
He's a drug war God.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.786
What... he looks
a little down, Darius.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.554
Why don't you go suck his dick?

34:18.523 --> 34:20.257
That ain't right.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.692
Well, you're making
cow eyes at him.
That ain't right.

34:50.455 --> 34:54.357
Stripper's here!
Whoo!
Ooh, yeah!

34:54.359 --> 34:56.626
Aren't you a little
old for this shit?

34:56.628 --> 34:58.328
Investigator Caroline brentwood.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.469
I'm looking for Eddie Jordan.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.104
Neck!
Yo!

35:07.106 --> 35:08.438
I brought you a present.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.440
Oh, shit.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.542
Look at the water.

35:15.881 --> 35:20.283
Have a fucking
drink for my friend.
We buried him today.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.853
That's why I'm here.
You wanna go
somewhere private?

35:22.855 --> 35:24.855
Private?

35:24.857 --> 35:27.424
Fuck that.
This is family time.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.392
You just get the fuck over here

35:29.394 --> 35:32.162
and make it clap
for Uncle daddy.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.731
Look at you,
got the whole FBI getup.

35:35.566 --> 35:37.300
You got your badge.

35:37.302 --> 35:40.904
You dumb fuck,
that's the lead investigator

35:40.906 --> 35:42.706
in pyro's accident.
Am I right?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.374
It's a fucking stripper!

35:44.376 --> 35:45.775
She's not
the stripper.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.544
She's an apd investigator.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.513
Damn.
We'd welcome you.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.815
But I just want to know
what the fuck you
doing here right now.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.184
Well, I'm sorry to
rain on your bro down.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.286
I just need to get
a quick statement.

35:56.288 --> 35:59.356
Neck, lawyer the fuck up!
Don't say shit!

35:59.358 --> 36:03.260
Neck hates cops
because the columbian police

36:03.262 --> 36:05.463
beat the living shit out of
him for not paying a tranny.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.932
Dude, you fucking
gotta bring that up
every fucking time!

36:08.934 --> 36:11.168
I got worse PTSD
from a dude in heels

36:11.170 --> 36:13.303
than anything I got
in that fucking place.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.372
I'll strip
for you, honey bear.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.209
Get her, grinder.

36:20.212 --> 36:25.415
Pull your fucking panties
out of your ass, sweetheart,
and take the beer.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.417
It's a party.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.553
Well, since you
put it like that.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.662
I like the way you play.
Now lick it off.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.630
One step closer,
I rip your fucking
balls off.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.699
Whoo!
Get her,
baby bird! Get her!

36:42.701 --> 36:43.934
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

36:43.936 --> 36:45.268
Boss, come on!

36:45.270 --> 36:47.237
Come on, settle down, shut up.

36:47.239 --> 36:50.440
This is my fucking house,
okay? She's a guest!

36:51.676 --> 36:53.944
Guest, my ass.
Come on. Let's go inside.

36:53.946 --> 36:55.979
Hit that, breach, get some!

36:55.981 --> 36:58.248
Investigate
the shit out of that.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.616
Whose round it is?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.384
Pyro's!

37:03.355 --> 37:06.923
I've been chasing
your man three days
for a five-minute interview.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.425
Can you do something about that?

37:13.764 --> 37:15.365
You some kind of a big deal?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.534
Yeah. I've been around.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.403
I speak to him tomorrow,
or I go over your head.

37:21.872 --> 37:23.640
I will make it happen.

37:26.777 --> 37:28.378
Your friend's here.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.416
I wouldn't bother.
Tips are lousy.

37:35.353 --> 37:38.455
Liquor store's
cleared by arrest.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.890
We present to
Nichols on Tuesday.
No.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.392
Suspect has taken a plea.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.728
Who says?
Nichols' office.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.764
Funny how they do that
when they're on video.
Mmm-hmm.

37:47.766 --> 37:51.534
Train versus rv.
It's ruled accidental,

37:51.536 --> 37:54.004
so I'm thinking this
is not our problem.

37:54.006 --> 37:56.873
I just have one
interview to do on that.
I'll knock it out tonight.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.976
It's accidental.
Who cares?

37:59.978 --> 38:02.979
Right, so no one should
interview the last guy
who saw him alive?

38:03.614 --> 38:05.282
Perfectionist.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.621
Breacher. Gotta go.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.822
Breacher. Damn.

38:13.591 --> 38:16.393
He's sexting me.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.862
All right, man,
just go. Go ahead.
Want to see?

38:18.864 --> 38:20.297
Get out of my face
with that, man.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.298
He's a natural blond, you know.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.832
Get out of my face.
Oh, yeah.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.068
I don't want to hear
nothing about that.

38:25.603 --> 38:27.370
You are dirty.

38:27.372 --> 38:28.438
Jezebel.

38:30.508 --> 38:33.310
I've known
some cops in my time,

38:33.312 --> 38:35.712
but your people
don't seem like cops.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.480
Good.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.649
They're the best undercover
agents in the DEA.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.752
Work hard, play hard, right?

38:44.556 --> 38:46.389
Look who's talking.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.991
You enjoy your cups.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.627
Why do you say that?

38:50.629 --> 38:51.761
Your skin.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.366
Wow.

38:56.368 --> 38:57.467
Just...

38:57.469 --> 38:58.935
Wow.

39:04.508 --> 39:05.575
Wow.

39:11.582 --> 39:12.582
Neck!

39:13.417 --> 39:14.551
It's me!

39:18.723 --> 39:20.390
Shit, no light.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.025
Come on.

39:26.430 --> 39:27.931
You don't need that.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.499
I'm a cautious girl.

39:30.501 --> 39:31.501
Neck!

39:32.436 --> 39:34.404
Wake up, you drunk fuck!

39:44.014 --> 39:45.982
You got right. Move.

39:49.687 --> 39:50.720
Clear.

39:51.789 --> 39:53.022
Clear.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.833
Sorry.

40:08.939 --> 40:10.473
Let me clear this.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.177
Move.

40:20.050 --> 40:21.451
- Clear.
- Okay.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.796
Where the fuck is he?

40:35.699 --> 40:36.699
Oh, fuck!

40:47.845 --> 40:50.013
Would you help me up, please?

40:50.015 --> 40:51.214
Can you help me up, please?

40:57.988 --> 41:00.156
Thank you very much.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.126
Well, we found him.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.877
You smoke?

41:20.879 --> 41:24.514
Only when I find
my witnesses nailed
to the ceiling.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.516
Right. I'm gonna leave.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.852
No, you're not.
You're not fucking leaving!

41:28.854 --> 41:30.653
You're in this now.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.589
What are you talking about?

41:32.591 --> 41:33.790
I'm a fed.

41:34.625 --> 41:35.725
See you.

41:38.863 --> 41:40.597
You're an asshole.

41:49.206 --> 41:51.908
All right,
let's cut him down.

41:51.910 --> 41:55.645
From a preliminary
investigation, I have
a cause of death.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.647
Massive hemothorax.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.083
From a right
ventricular
stab wound.

42:00.085 --> 42:02.285
This, where
my finger is...
Uh-huh.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.921
That's how far the knife
went inside his chest.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.223
Okay.
And they
gutted him like a pig.

42:08.893 --> 42:10.927
Hey, doc,
this guy's a trained guy.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.929
Who could walk up on
a trained guy like that?

42:12.931 --> 42:15.198
Somebody that had
better skills than he had.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.700
He knew exactly
where he was stabbing.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.203
Boo-yah! Got some hairs.
Not the victim's.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.739
Show me.
Right here.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.073
And here's some more. Here.

42:24.075 --> 42:25.708
Can you bag those?
Sure.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.911
I'll take them
to the lab myself.

42:27.913 --> 42:29.779
Okay.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.781
- Thanks, guys.
- Sure.

42:31.783 --> 42:33.616
- Thanks.
- You got it.

42:37.288 --> 42:41.724
You know, in northern Ireland,
the ira nailed snitches
to the kitchen floor.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.159
How do you know shit like that?

42:43.161 --> 42:44.961
Some research I was doing.

42:44.963 --> 42:48.131
Okay, so you put out a bolo
for lucky charms guy.

42:48.133 --> 42:52.302
Hey, take a criminalist
and sweep the rv's cab.

42:52.304 --> 42:53.544
For what?
What am I looking for?

42:53.904 --> 42:55.138
Linkage.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.717
They're dead and we're not.
What are we doing?

43:07.719 --> 43:10.753
We d-up and
present a hard target.

43:10.755 --> 43:14.157
Like taking showers
with full body armor.

43:14.159 --> 43:16.759
Well, we need fucking intel.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.928
Who'd they send up?
Well, who do you think,
sweetheart?

43:18.930 --> 43:20.063
Check the board!

43:20.065 --> 43:22.599
Could be soto!
Could be fucking romero!

43:22.601 --> 43:25.034
They may be... fucking...

43:25.036 --> 43:26.970
Any of this a surprise to you?

43:28.172 --> 43:29.872
Just let it go, huh?

43:29.874 --> 43:32.909
I don't really know
what you're talking about.

43:34.378 --> 43:37.614
Guess I'm the only one
with any fucking balls here.

43:39.016 --> 43:40.950
It's the goddamn money.

43:42.653 --> 43:44.821
Just let
it go, all right?
No!

43:46.056 --> 43:48.291
We had to go fingering
the devil's pussy.

43:48.293 --> 43:51.394
It's an occupational
hazard when you
fight the cartels.

43:51.396 --> 43:52.996
Oh, really?

43:52.998 --> 43:54.964
You see any other
feds getting smoked?

43:54.966 --> 43:57.033
It could happen to anyone.
Bullshit!

43:58.035 --> 44:00.303
You believe that, chief?

44:00.305 --> 44:04.240
Or is that just some shit
you're spitting in case
this place is bugged?

44:04.242 --> 44:07.310
Always assume that
someone is listening.

44:09.346 --> 44:12.215
So shut the fuck up.

44:16.353 --> 44:18.121
I ain't gonna fight you, boss.

45:35.299 --> 45:36.733
Where the fuck are you going?

45:39.069 --> 45:40.503
Out.

45:41.772 --> 45:43.139
I'm bored.

45:43.141 --> 45:44.474
You're not going out.

45:44.476 --> 45:46.142
It's not safe.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.845
They're hunting us.

45:48.847 --> 45:51.414
I can take care of myself.

45:51.416 --> 45:55.485
Give that back to me.
Give that back to me!
Monster!

45:56.487 --> 45:58.221
What's this, huh?

45:58.223 --> 45:59.223
Is this chewing gum?

45:59.224 --> 46:01.057
Huh?
Yeah.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.092
What the fuck you need this for?

46:03.094 --> 46:05.061
What the fuck do
you need this for?

46:06.164 --> 46:07.864
Get out of my way.
No, lizzy.

46:17.175 --> 46:19.008
It's the stripper.

46:19.010 --> 46:20.309
Can we talk inside?

46:20.311 --> 46:21.591
What the fuck
do you want?

46:22.880 --> 46:25.882
Just some background
information on
your unit.

46:25.884 --> 46:28.050
So I can develop some suspects.

46:33.290 --> 46:35.358
You know what we do, right?

46:35.360 --> 46:38.928
This special operations team?

46:38.930 --> 46:40.263
Well, to be honest,
I have no idea.

46:40.265 --> 46:41.898
Why don't you tell me?

46:42.466 --> 46:43.900
We covertly

46:45.102 --> 46:46.302
penetrate

46:47.871 --> 46:50.473
drug organizations.

46:50.475 --> 46:53.209
I guess that
would make you
some enemies, huh?

46:53.211 --> 46:55.011
Any one come
to mind?

46:55.013 --> 46:56.412
Any particular guy

46:56.414 --> 47:00.550
that might nail special agent
Jordan to a ceiling?

47:00.552 --> 47:02.451
Are you really
this stupid?

47:02.453 --> 47:04.453
Ma'am, I'm not your friend,

47:04.455 --> 47:05.888
and I'm not your colleague.

47:05.890 --> 47:07.423
So don't bully me.

47:07.425 --> 47:08.491
Or I'll slap you

47:08.493 --> 47:09.892
with a 48-hour jail hold.

47:09.894 --> 47:13.496
You can't hack a day
without your favorite
controlled substance.

47:13.498 --> 47:15.097
So let's keep it nice, shall we?

47:15.099 --> 47:17.266
And yes, assume I'm stupid.

47:17.268 --> 47:18.868
Paint me a picture.

47:19.903 --> 47:20.970
Please.

47:29.112 --> 47:30.913
I took these in juarez.

47:31.548 --> 47:33.616
They're friends of mine.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.918
And this is what
the rios-garza cartel does

47:35.920 --> 47:37.987
to indicate that
you've pissed them off.

47:41.358 --> 47:44.961
Sweetheart,
you're so in over
your fucking head.

47:44.963 --> 47:47.630
You need more
than a glock and
sensible shoes.

47:48.332 --> 47:49.932
Walk away.

47:50.601 --> 47:52.001
Walk away.

47:57.875 --> 48:00.409
I'll show myself out.
Thank you for your time.

48:00.411 --> 48:01.944
It's our pleasure.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.014
We're gonna have
to each get two jobs

48:05.016 --> 48:06.549
just to put him through school.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.284
Have you
considered prostitution?

48:08.286 --> 48:10.286
Hey, what's up?
More black hairs.

48:11.022 --> 48:15.157
A beautiful thumbprint
we got off the steering
column of the rv.

48:15.159 --> 48:17.493
It's not the Vic's.
Boo-yeah! Linkage.

48:18.428 --> 48:20.496
You just said
"boo-yeah."

48:20.498 --> 48:23.065
That's my thing.
Don't Jack my thing.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.970
I heard the lab tech
say it.

48:28.338 --> 48:29.939
I didn't hear it.

48:29.941 --> 48:31.274
Bullshit, you heard it.

48:31.276 --> 48:33.009
Well, if she said it,
she got it from me.

48:36.046 --> 48:38.614
Due to the staging
of special agent
Jordan's body,

48:38.616 --> 48:41.550
we believe
there's a connection
to the rios-garza cartel.

48:41.552 --> 48:44.654
Dto. Rios-garza drug
trafficking organization.

48:44.656 --> 48:46.923
We don't use
the term "cartel."

48:48.191 --> 48:49.325
Thank you, sir.

48:49.327 --> 48:50.693
It seems that special agent
Roberts' death

48:50.695 --> 48:52.628
was not an accident.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.931
We have recovered
physical evidence linking
the two crime scenes.

48:54.933 --> 48:56.565
I would like to have
a copy of those files,

48:56.567 --> 48:58.134
if you could make
those available for me.

48:58.136 --> 49:00.670
Yes, sir.
Today, would that
be all right?

49:00.672 --> 49:03.139
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

49:03.141 --> 49:05.675
Investigator brentwood,
what exactly do
you want from us?

49:05.677 --> 49:08.644
Well, learning about
the victims helps me
find the suspects.

49:08.646 --> 49:12.114
Maybe these murders
are blowback from
cases they worked on.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.417
You want access
to DEA case files?

49:14.419 --> 49:16.252
It would help.

49:16.254 --> 49:18.521
Are you asking for
investigatory support
or access to our records?

49:18.523 --> 49:19.622
Both.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.690
Look, maybe there's someone

49:20.692 --> 49:22.024
I can liaise with,
someone who...

49:22.026 --> 49:26.062
your agency needs to
draft a formal letter
requesting assistance.

49:26.064 --> 49:29.165
Any documents you want
access to will need to
be specifically cited.

49:29.167 --> 49:31.200
Specifically cited.
What information
do you need?

49:31.202 --> 49:34.036
Incident report numbers.
File numbers.

49:34.038 --> 49:36.439
And how are we going
to know those numbers

49:36.441 --> 49:38.374
if we don't know those numbers?

49:38.376 --> 49:39.976
If you don't know
really what you want,

49:39.978 --> 49:42.278
what are you doing here?

49:42.280 --> 49:44.547
Two murders of DEA agents

49:44.549 --> 49:46.215
have happened on my watch.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.017
And it's my job to
investigate them,

49:48.019 --> 49:50.219
and I'm asking for your help.

49:50.221 --> 49:52.862
Just have the chief
fire off a letter, and
we'll see what we can do.

49:53.690 --> 49:55.725
Thank you for coming in.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.361
Have a nice day, y'all.

49:58.363 --> 50:01.364
Fucking us attorney
and their own general counsel?

50:01.366 --> 50:02.732
These guys are scared.

50:02.734 --> 50:05.001
Hey. You're brentwood,
you're Jackson, right?

50:05.003 --> 50:07.636
You working the agent
nailed to the ceiling?

50:07.638 --> 50:09.372
What do you know about that?

50:09.374 --> 50:11.507
The DEA is a dysfunctional
family, all right?

50:11.509 --> 50:13.476
No one's going to talk
family business with you.

50:13.478 --> 50:14.710
Who are you?
Got a card?

50:14.712 --> 50:19.115
Everything happens
for a reason.
Think about that.

50:24.187 --> 50:26.522
Stop leaving your
shit on my seat.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.190
That's not mine.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.292
It's not some porn
you're hiding from
your wife?

50:31.629 --> 50:33.062
That's not mine.

50:33.064 --> 50:34.663
It's not mine.

50:34.665 --> 50:37.233
<i> You're out here saving</i>
<i>these adrenaline junkies</i>

50:37.235 --> 50:40.302
<i>that mean absolutely nothing</i>
<i>to this department.</i>

50:40.304 --> 50:42.038
<i> I would take</i>
<i>a bullet for those guys.</i>

50:42.040 --> 50:43.305
<i>Hmm. You'd take a bullet.</i>

50:43.307 --> 50:44.540
<i>Would you take 10 million bucks?</i>

50:44.542 --> 50:46.609
<i>Would you take $10 million?</i>

50:46.611 --> 50:48.144
<i>Where's the money?</i>

50:48.146 --> 50:51.313
<i>Where's the money?</i>
<i>You dumb fuck, you!</i>

50:51.315 --> 50:52.615
<i>Look at you!</i>

50:52.617 --> 50:54.483
<i>With your fucking 48% body fat.</i>

50:54.485 --> 50:57.186
<i>And, you, scrawny</i>
<i>little bastard!</i>

50:57.188 --> 50:58.828
<i>- Fuck you guys!</i>
<i>- Go to the gym, John.</i>

50:59.756 --> 51:02.525
Fucking liar.
Fucking liar!

51:02.527 --> 51:04.093
He's a fucking liar.

51:04.095 --> 51:07.129
What? Caroline,
where you going?

51:12.070 --> 51:17.740
you were under investigation
for stealing from
the rios-garza cartel?

51:17.742 --> 51:19.375
Get in.

51:19.377 --> 51:20.576
I need a drink.

51:41.865 --> 51:43.766
I need you to be
straight with me, John.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.701
No, you be straight with me.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.670
Why do I have to find out
through the grapevine

51:47.672 --> 51:49.305
that you linked
the deaths of my people?

51:49.307 --> 51:50.840
They're linked,
I'm sorry. My turn.

51:50.842 --> 51:52.408
Did you steal the money?

51:52.410 --> 51:54.176
No.

51:54.178 --> 51:56.212
And fuck you
for asking.
Don't be such a girl.

51:56.214 --> 51:59.548
Your agency thinks you did.
So does the rios-garza cartel.

51:59.550 --> 52:01.717
Why do you think
they're killing your guys?

52:01.719 --> 52:04.553
Spend enough
time on the job,
the job bites back.

52:04.555 --> 52:06.222
That's bullshit.

52:08.325 --> 52:11.227
You going somewhere?

52:11.229 --> 52:13.729
One of my guys
quit the team.
He's off the grid.

52:13.731 --> 52:15.865
I gotta warn him.

52:15.867 --> 52:18.334
Okay, grab your stuff
and I'll drive.

52:22.205 --> 52:24.373
<i>They're going to continue</i>
<i>to fucking kill people,</i>

52:24.375 --> 52:28.777
<i>and women and children</i>
<i>in Mexico and</i>
<i>the United States</i>

52:28.779 --> 52:30.579
<i>unless you have</i>
<i>guys like me!</i>
<i> Son!</i>

52:30.581 --> 52:31.780
<i>That's a fact.</i>
<i>Son!</i>

52:31.782 --> 52:33.682
<i>Motherfucker, I quit.</i>

52:39.523 --> 52:42.324
Last fall, an 8-year-old girl
vanished from her bed.

52:42.326 --> 52:47.530
Only her daddy's bullshit
about hearing black voices.

52:49.499 --> 52:52.801
And he's a drinker.
Joins aa the week
after she disappears.

52:53.670 --> 52:54.837
He profiles, too.

52:54.839 --> 52:57.206
Domestic abuser, all that.

52:57.208 --> 52:58.307
And I can't find enough

52:58.309 --> 52:59.608
for the da to file.

52:59.610 --> 53:03.679
Just because you're
not in jail doesn't
mean you didn't do it.

53:04.614 --> 53:05.614
You're awesome on a road trip,

53:05.616 --> 53:06.715
you know that?

53:06.717 --> 53:09.185
Yeah, I've heard that before.

53:23.967 --> 53:25.935
That's it,
right there.

53:32.676 --> 53:34.843
It's beautiful.

53:34.845 --> 53:36.378
Watch out for booby traps.

53:38.348 --> 53:39.515
Bullshit.

53:40.550 --> 53:42.351
I'm serious.

53:42.353 --> 53:44.753
This could take
your leg right off.

53:44.755 --> 53:46.589
Here's the trip wire.

53:50.961 --> 53:53.429
Why is he so paranoid?

53:53.431 --> 53:55.351
Maybe he doesn't want to
get nailed to a ceiling.

54:08.545 --> 54:09.878
Tripod!

54:16.820 --> 54:18.354
Mcneely?

54:19.689 --> 54:21.290
It's John!

54:35.572 --> 54:36.872
There's something off.

56:12.736 --> 56:13.902
Fuck.

56:18.074 --> 56:19.641
Unit 2150.

56:21.077 --> 56:24.480
Send me two units
and an me to my location.

56:53.710 --> 56:55.411
Ak brass.

56:59.048 --> 57:00.883
The guy hit the trip wire.

57:01.851 --> 57:03.152
Right there.

57:11.895 --> 57:13.729
Looks like he bled out.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.067
Here, hold this.

57:27.076 --> 57:28.577
What's that?

57:28.579 --> 57:30.145
They're world-class assholes.

57:32.615 --> 57:35.617
Give me the weapon.
I don't trust you.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.853
Well, you know,
it was getting
heavy anyway.

57:52.569 --> 57:53.969
Hey!

57:55.038 --> 57:56.705
How you feeling?

57:58.241 --> 57:59.842
I'm sorry?

57:59.844 --> 58:02.511
Well, now that
you got sucked
into our world.

58:08.485 --> 58:09.718
They're kaibiles.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.687
Kaibiles?

58:11.689 --> 58:13.722
Guatemalan special forces.

58:13.724 --> 58:18.527
Rios-garza organization
loves to use them
for high-power hits.

58:20.497 --> 58:24.833
You know, mcneely was
a fucking Navy seal.

58:26.669 --> 58:31.540
He was 10 times
the operator that
I'll ever be.

58:34.944 --> 58:37.112
What chance do you think I got?

58:40.016 --> 58:43.719
See, they're the best
assassins that money
can buy.

58:43.721 --> 58:46.021
Honey, I worked gangs
for eight years.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.890
Streets have rules, okay?

58:47.892 --> 58:49.525
You steal money,
doesn't matter
who you are,

58:49.527 --> 58:51.260
you can be a cop,
you could be God,

58:52.128 --> 58:54.096
they will get you.

58:54.098 --> 58:56.632
I came here to help you.

58:56.634 --> 58:58.600
No, you did not.
To help you understand.

58:58.602 --> 59:00.002
You came here 'cause you
think you're gonna be next.

59:00.004 --> 59:02.137
You came here to steer me, okay?

59:02.139 --> 59:03.705
If you want to help me,

59:03.707 --> 59:05.173
and if you don't
want to get nailed
to a ceiling

59:05.175 --> 59:07.276
or run over by a train,

59:07.278 --> 59:09.678
you need to break
free from your buddies

59:09.680 --> 59:12.848
and tell me something
I don't know about
John wharton.

59:12.850 --> 59:13.916
Because I can't read him.

59:13.918 --> 59:15.284
Tell me something I don't know.

59:21.925 --> 59:23.892
Two years ago,

59:23.894 --> 59:26.895
<i>we arrested</i>
<i>Edgar rios in juarez.</i>

59:26.897 --> 59:29.765
<i>He was</i>
<i>an old-school drug lord,</i>
<i>ran all their operations.</i>

59:39.042 --> 59:40.776
<i>It was a big deal.</i>

59:55.124 --> 59:57.292
<i>We're handing him</i>
<i>over to the Mexicans</i>

59:59.662 --> 01:00:02.064
<i>when some broad</i>
<i>pulls her shit</i>
<i>and dumps him.</i>

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:09.137
<i>Cartel didn't</i>
<i>want him debriefed</i>
<i>by our intel people.</i>

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.276
<i>Problem solved.</i>

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:25.053
<i>But they had a bigger problem.</i>

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:29.191
<i>They wanted the man</i>
<i>who can get the man</i>
<i>that nobody can get.</i>

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.634
<i>John gets a call</i>

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:40.636
<i>from the bad guys.</i>

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:47.109
<i>They snatched his wife</i>
<i>and kid right out of</i>
<i>his house on lake lanier.</i>

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.245
<i>They're holding them in juarez.</i>

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:54.282
<i>They make him an offer.</i>

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:58.120
<i>"Surrender yourself</i>
<i>to the cartel and</i>
<i>your family lives."</i>

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.922
<i>John's family is everything.</i>

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.659
<i>John was married forever.</i>

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:08.030
<i>His son Jacob was</i>
<i>his best friend.</i>

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:09.197
Love you, dad.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:15.671
<i>They tortured Karen</i>
<i>and Jacob to death.</i>

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:18.106
<i>There's video.</i>
<i>Evil shit.</i>

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:24.746
<i>They mailed pieces of them</i>
<i>to his home for weeks.</i>

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:26.748
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:33.722
<i> So John</i>
<i>went down there. Alone.</i>

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:37.793
<i>Hunting the man</i>
<i>who killed his wife.</i>

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.395
John, we're coming in!

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.841
<i>He didn't find him.</i>

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:57.045
We're here to
bring you back home.

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.817
This isn't going
to bring them back.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.137
Come on.
Let's go home.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.843
<i> John is</i>
<i>obsessed with finding</i>
<i>his wife's killer.</i>

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.381
<i>It's like a cancer in his soul.</i>

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:43.825
Caroline, we lost John
when they died.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.065
Go home.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.304
Go home now.

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.041
I was just trying to help.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.188
I'm sorry.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:16.024
I'm so sorry.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.432
John.

01:03:24.434 --> 01:03:27.869
Wait up. I didn't
know about your family.
John, I'm sorry, I...

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.574
Now you know.

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.543
They sent me her face.

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:39.815
I'm sorry.

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.452
I'm sorry.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.572
So this isn't creepy.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:07.108
Someone else get killed?

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.244
I brought a peace offering.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.458
Let me show you something.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:28.063
Your shooters.
They're Guatemalan
special forces.

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:30.866
They came in
through juarez
with stolen visas.

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:33.535
Ice alerted, ran surveillance.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.470
But lost them
outside of Atlanta.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.372
Now, you said you had prints.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:40.976
Yeah. We got one
at the rv,

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:42.878
and one outside mcneely's cabin.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.880
But no ncic hits.

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.015
See if these match.

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:54.055
Pretty please.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.999
Ice took them off
some beer cans inside
their hotel room.

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.469
Should I have these?

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.537
No.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.075
Then why'd you give them to me?

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:17.512
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.964
Holy shit.

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.603
No way.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.540
Don't say a word.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:47.008
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.678
What happened to
"I'll never date a cop"?

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.314
Who said anything about a date?

01:05:52.316 --> 01:05:53.648
Evil harlot.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.518
I can't believe you said that.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.019
You dirty, dirty girl.

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:00.555
So I got a present for you.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.958
Check that out.

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:05.994
Oh!

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:10.632
Dude looks like
Mario from <i> donkey Kong.</i>
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.234
Who's the metrosexual
with the... you've got...

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:16.237
Prints, records, everything.

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:17.639
Did he leave it on
your night stand?

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.207
You don't want to know.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:21.209
Shit.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:24.012
Get in the car.
You all right?
'Cause you walking funny.

01:06:24.014 --> 01:06:25.380
You're just jealous.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:29.284
Is he a big dude?

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:32.087
Like, is he big?

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:33.621
That's inappropriate.

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:35.623
Was it good?
Shut up. Shut up.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:36.591
Is he ripped,
like a six-pack?

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.159
Shut up.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.362
Just wondering.
'Cause he's, like,
a legend.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:41.730
You're good to go.

01:06:41.732 --> 01:06:43.732
It's a match.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:48.436
Thank you, tish.
Okay, I'm going to write out
a warrant-affidavit.

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:50.772
You put out a bolo,
armed and dangerous.

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:54.609
That we got slipped
some secret squirrel
ice file?

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:58.446
Once they're in custody,
we can get as many
print cards as we want.

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:01.016
Doesn't matter
how we get there,
as long as we get there.

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.152
Do we know where they are?

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.621
Negative.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:10.225
So we still got no target?

01:07:10.227 --> 01:07:15.130
We could be drinking beers,
throwing dollars
at something naked.

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:16.731
We're standing by.

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:18.733
For what?

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:22.604
Apparently, the boss
got that investigator
lady working for us now.

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.072
Ain't that right, boss?

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.074
Is that true?

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:30.445
Hey. Grab a vest.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:35.050
That ice file your
boyfriend gave you
had a credit card.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.584
I linked it to a cell phone.

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:38.686
That cell phone is live
in an apartment building.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:40.688
That apartment building,
narco knows about it.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.757
It's a rios-garza
safe house.

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:45.393
Okay, enough
energy drinks, partner.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:49.564
While you've
been saving mankind,
I drafted an affidavit.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.267
I sent it to the clerk,
judge signed it.

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:54.736
Yes, you're right.
I need that.
Okay.

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.137
You're right.
I'm sorry. I was excited.

01:07:56.139 --> 01:08:00.475
I got excited about it,
but we gotta go
kick some doors, baby.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:24.299
Multi-level residential.
Four units.

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:27.234
Brick and masonry.
Fortified with
barred windows.

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:31.673
Steel security doors.
You got an iron fence
around three sides.

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:33.541
All right,
what's the plan, boss?

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.143
<i>We blue angel up the back.</i>

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:38.113
Single point dynamic entry.
Explosive breach.

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:39.514
We don't know
what unit they're in,

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:43.885
All right, let's smoke
these motherfuckers and
get us some dinner then.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.752
Two Mikes out.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.589
<i> Two out, copy.</i>

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.224
We're at the railroad tracks.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.292
Here we go, stand by.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.460
<i> Roger that.</i>

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.895
We're not here to
make arrests, right?

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.151
Breach!

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:26.528
They killed two
federal agents already.
They're not fucking around!

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.229
No matter what,
we all go home tonight
at the end of this mission.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.917
You know what you're
doing with that thing?

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:39.841
I was in the army.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.176
It's the wrong way up.
It's not the wrong way up.

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:43.377
You got to rack it
all the way back.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.679
Come on.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.281
I know how to rack a gun.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.624
- Keep your hands up.
- Let me see your hands.

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:58.526
Stay right there.

01:09:58.528 --> 01:09:59.688
Stay on the bed, kid.

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:01.429
Shitty closet!

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.231
Clear!

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:04.766
Clear!
Good! Let's go!

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.748
Ready to go!

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:10.905
Don't stop!

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:12.674
- Going left!
- Right!

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:14.776
Got your back.

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:15.643
Got a bathroom! Clear!

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:17.946
All clear!
Clear.

01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:19.614
- We're all set, boss!
- Keep moving!

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:21.216
Stay tight!

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.958
- One on the couch!
- I got left.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.720
- Put your hands up!
- Going left, boss!

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.562
Closet, clear!
Let me see your hands!

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:35.763
Anyone else in here?

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:37.298
Coming around.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.933
Anyone else in here?
Just my kids.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:40.969
Kids in the back!

01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:42.337
- There are kids.
- Door!

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:43.238
Stay right
where you are!

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.505
Just keep them up.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:46.908
I got high.
Get low!

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.576
- Don't move.
- Clear.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.511
Checking for mice.

01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:51.613
Clear!

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:52.615
We're clear!

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:54.482
Moving.

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:56.251
Just stay on the bed.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:58.019
Stay on the bed.

01:10:58.021 --> 01:10:59.661
- We're clear!
- Keep moving.

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.324
Stack up!

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.293
Okay. Ready?

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:07.328
Yup. Door.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.707
You get him!
Go, go, go. Let's roll.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:20.975
Okay, move it!

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:23.745
Fuck!

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:24.907
We're tight, pop it!

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:28.883
Asshole down!

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.327
We're clear!

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:51.673
Fuck!

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.644
Target down.
Move! Move! Move!

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:08.656
Clear!

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.699
Clear!

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:18.800
Clear!

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:20.802
Sugar, let's go.

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:29.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
<i>Calmate!</i> Easy! Easy!

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:32.814
- Good kill, baby.
- Come on!

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:33.748
I got the hostage.
Clear!

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.516
Going right!

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.718
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.588
- We're clear!
- Clear!

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:43.958
Good fucking gunfight!
God damn!

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.993
- Hello.
- Hey, boss!

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:47.395
You might want to get in here!

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.397
What?

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.667
Ta-da!

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:54.769
You got your kit, babe?

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.851
- Right, we're secure.
- I'm gonna ID these guys.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.741
So which asshole are you?

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:01.642
Lizzy, don't fucking do that!

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:03.845
Liquid meth! Hell yeah!

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.434
You're one
fucked up bitch!

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.551
Yeah, it's meth.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:11.719
This is one
for the books.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:12.721
Breach.

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:15.723
It's not them.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:16.824
It's not
the kaibiles!
What do you mean?

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:19.794
You mean we killed
six motherfuckers
and it ain't them?

01:13:19.796 --> 01:13:21.429
Well, check again!

01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:22.597
Okay.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.768
No! Still not them!

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.137
Dead man walking!
Fuck me!

01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:30.438
Fucking shit.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:56.464
Stay tight.
Behind you, brother.

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.218
All right, it's clear.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.687
Get ems in here.

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:21.055
There's a lot of bodies.

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:23.691
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.194
It's my job.

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:28.563
You used me.

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.702
Breacher, God damn it!

01:14:34.704 --> 01:14:36.537
What the fuck is going on here?

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:38.673
Clean up,
aisle three.

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:42.043
God almighty!

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:44.078
What's wrong?
Son of a bitch
is snagged!

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.480
Gimme a knife.
I'm gonna cut
the son of a bitch.

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.482
The hell you are.
That's a new anchor.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:49.183
Damn, it is heavy,
though.
Yeah, it is!

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:51.085
All right, keep pulling.

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.188
What the hell?

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:56.591
Jesus Christ!
Stay back, son!

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:58.059
Turn around.
Don't look.

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.186
How'd they die?

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.054
Looks like a gun fight.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:29.056
Can you give me race and sex?

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:31.192
Male hispanics, all three.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:33.528
Why the chicken wire?

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:37.932
As their bodies bloat,
the wire cuts them,
releasing the decomp gas.

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:40.034
They never float to the surface.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.270
Yeah, great tip.
I gotta remember that one.

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:43.804
Okay, how long they been dead?

01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:45.006
A week.
You sure?

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:46.807
A what?
At least a week.

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:49.243
If it's the guys
that we think...

01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:51.546
They've been dead
more than a week...
Wait, are these the...

01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:53.848
The military guys
from the cartel?
Yeah.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.950
You think this is them?
The Guatemalans.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:57.218
I think it's them.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.920
He said they've
been dead for a week.

01:15:58.922 --> 01:16:00.588
It can't be the Guatemalans.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.723
That's why
we need to find these tattoos.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.192
The guy at the cabin
had a tattoo on
his left shoulder.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:07.595
And if we have a match,
then they're part of
the same gang, right?

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:08.930
The killers are the victims?

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:10.665
It just can't be that, Caroline.

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.333
- Tattoo, left shoulder.
- Have we got anything?

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:14.602
Ah, nice!

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.971
We got it.
Darius, come see this.

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:18.306
This is our guy.

01:16:18.308 --> 01:16:20.708
That's it?
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:21.710
Who the hell killed them?

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:22.977
Nice.

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:23.945
Here we go.

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:25.012
What you got?

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.049
Thumb's missing.

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:30.785
Right here.
Right.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:36.223
Okay, so that explains
how we got thumbprints
in Roberts' rv, huh?

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:37.745
Looks like
we're working late.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.138
Look, if they've been dead
a week already, right?

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.841
They sure as hell
didn't nail Jordan
to that ceiling.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:55.876
Or drive Roberts
over the train tracks.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:58.613
The Guatemalans
killed tripod mcneely, okay?

01:16:58.615 --> 01:17:01.082
Then somebody kills them,
uses them for cover.

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:03.217
Come on, Darius, think about it.

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.186
Who killed the cartel hit men,

01:17:05.188 --> 01:17:07.922
sprinkles their DNA
over two separate
crime scenes,

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:09.991
wants us to
think they're alive?
Who do we like for this?

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:13.361
Everybody! We like
everybody for this one!

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.242
<i>John, please! John!</i>

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:30.011
<i> Tell John</i>
<i>to come for you!</i>
<i>John! Please, John!</i>

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:32.847
<i>Tell him come for you!</i>
<i>John!</i>

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:35.650
<i>Come find me! John!</i>

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.185
<i>Please!</i>

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.258
<i>Oh, no!</i>

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.902
<i>We had a good time, didn't we?</i>

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.782
<i>I love you, John!</i>

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:16.183
Who the fuck is hunting us?

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:19.019
Who do
you think, breach?

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:20.387
It's one of us.

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.323
It's you!

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.125
Or it's grinder!

01:19:24.127 --> 01:19:26.393
Or sugar!
Or my dear
loving husband!

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:29.296
Is it you, bitch?

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:31.099
No, I keep track
of the people I whack.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.368
Neck and pyro ain't on the list.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.804
See, I think that she's right!

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:40.808
I think she's fucking right.
Nailed it.

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:42.143
So which fucker is it, huh?

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:49.850
Fucking crazy!
I mean, why?

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:52.086
You know why, breach.
It was the fucking money.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:53.788
Amen.

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:56.257
'Cause some of us
are getting paid,

01:19:56.259 --> 01:19:58.459
and the rest of us
are just getting dead.

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:00.327
Oh, bullshit!

01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:03.164
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:06.534
This has been fun,
but I'm out of here.

01:20:06.536 --> 01:20:09.203
I see any of
your fucking faces
and I'll kill you!

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.339
Ammo's cheap.
My life ain't!

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.244
It's over.

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:20.080
Where'd you
bury it, grinder?

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.925
Now we fall apart?

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:34.829
We scatter to the wind?

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:36.096
Yeah,
I like that idea.

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.968
Honey.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.269
Yes, sweetheart?

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:45.940
I've been fucking sugar.

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:50.044
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:53.147
That's not what we talked about!

01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:54.215
Look, man.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:57.518
Look, it is what it is, dude.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.087
What do you want me to say?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:02.223
Is it gonna make it any better?

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:04.024
You fucker!
I'm going to kill you!

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.426
Monster! No!

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:08.395
I thought you were
my fucking friend!

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:11.165
Boss, I'm gonna kill him!
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:13.367
Get the fuck out of here!

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.436
Why the fuck would
you do that shit?

01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:17.104
Get the fuck out of here!

01:21:17.106 --> 01:21:19.607
Fucking have a nice life,
you fucking cunt!

01:21:19.609 --> 01:21:20.609
You deserve each other!

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:24.311
I warned you.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.349
We fucked up.

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.619
We fucked up, didn't we?

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:45.366
What do you want?

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.234
Can we talk?

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.437
We stole the money.

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.643
It was breacher's idea.

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:57.611
We thought it
would make him happy.

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.614
It was $10 million in cash.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.351
Went back for it that night,

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:07.221
but when we got there,
it was gone.

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:10.491
DEA, they wanted
to throw us
in a hole

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:13.093
and throw away the hole.

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:16.030
Crawled up our asses
with a microscope
for six months.

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:18.165
Nobody broke.

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:21.669
So who has the money?

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:24.371
It's lizzy.

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.107
Or monster or sugar.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.944
I don't know.

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:31.346
She's playing one
against the other.

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:34.949
What do you want to do?

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:37.251
Fuck them all.
Let them hang.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.331
After I lost my family,

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:52.700
I asked myself what
was I fighting for.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.569
The answer was simple.

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:56.704
My team.

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:01.241
I wanted them to get
something out of all of this.

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:02.243
But instead,

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:06.113
I destroyed them.

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:10.517
Agent Phillips is
going to the DEA.

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:19.626
I'm not telling you
it's gonna be okay.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.230
Because it's not.

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.166
Not for you.

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:48.322
Hey, John.
Hey.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.294
I'm sorry.

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:57.264
Don't apologize.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:03.037
I would have
stepped up
if you didn't.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.407
You're doing the right thing.

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:09.676
I ride this ship down.

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:12.146
I ride it down.

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:15.416
But you,

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:17.184
you could still
have a life after this.

01:24:17.186 --> 01:24:18.652
Doing what, John?

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.088
Where?

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.690
This is all I do.

01:24:23.692 --> 01:24:25.259
And it's over.

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.296
We can protect you.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.533
Get down!

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:34.568
Stay down.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:53.153
Tell me again.

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:55.656
We were up the block,
heard gunfire.

01:24:55.658 --> 01:24:58.459
We made contact with
a female DEA agent.

01:24:58.461 --> 01:25:00.160
Female DEA agent?

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:02.229
She left in a vehicle
with a black male.

01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:05.299
A DEA agent.
You heard gunfire!

01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:07.501
Sir, she badged us.
She was legit.

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:08.702
She left.

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.571
Is this the woman you saw?

01:25:10.573 --> 01:25:11.872
Yeah. That's her.

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.275
You said "black male"?

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.644
Yes, sir.
A red vehicle.

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:19.513
Sugar.
That's your guy, too?

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:52.146
Clear.

01:25:58.186 --> 01:25:59.386
What's all this?

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:01.855
She's bailing.

01:26:01.857 --> 01:26:04.458
She'll never make it.
Every cop in Georgia's
looking for her.

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.926
She won't get far.

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:07.928
Yes, she will.

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:14.735
Do you think
that he loves you?

01:26:14.737 --> 01:26:17.938
What do you think the plan is?
To just go run
off and make babies?

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:21.441
Well, you're gonna
be needing this.

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:27.781
Just give me my shit

01:26:27.783 --> 01:26:29.650
and quit fucking around.

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:40.827
Don't do it! Monster!

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:44.698
Fuck you!

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:51.438
Oh, fuck.

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:54.575
Baby, I'm sorry!

01:26:57.346 --> 01:26:58.946
Baby. Oh, God.

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:01.648
Lay down.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.254
I'm sorry, monster.
I'm sorry.

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:22.703
Oh, Jesus!

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.640
Jesus!

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.805
I'm going to kill her.

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:04.811
Yeah?

01:28:04.813 --> 01:28:06.880
<i> Hey. I fucked up.</i>

01:28:06.882 --> 01:28:08.782
<i>I didn't mean</i>
<i>for this to happen.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.051
Where are you?
<i>Midtown.</i>

01:28:11.053 --> 01:28:13.453
Are you alone?
<i>Yeah, I'm alone.</i>

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:15.756
Who would I be with?

01:28:15.758 --> 01:28:19.493
<i>Can I see you?</i>
Meet me inside
the parking structure on 4th.

01:28:19.495 --> 01:28:21.795
<i>Thanks, breach.</i>
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:27.467
That motherfucker!

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:28.735
Parking garage?

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.570
Mmm.

01:28:30.572 --> 01:28:32.973
This ain't his first rodeo.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:34.608
Since he wants to be a hero,

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:37.577
let's give him somebody to save.

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:47.321
Federal agent!
Get out of the fucking car!
Did you hear me?

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:49.056
Open the fucking door!
Open the fucking door!

01:28:49.058 --> 01:28:50.390
Get out of
the fucking car!

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:07.507
There she is. Get down.

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:43.910
He's down!
He's down!

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:52.486
Who the fuck is that in the car?

01:29:57.625 --> 01:29:58.792
Shit!

01:29:58.794 --> 01:29:59.826
It's that bitch!

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:19.880
Go, go, go!

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:31.191
Hold your ass, sweetie!
Here we go!

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:42.869
Jesus Christ!

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.907
Take the vest!

01:30:46.909 --> 01:30:48.675
Put it on the dash
and stay down!

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:52.746
Fuck me!

01:30:52.748 --> 01:30:54.214
Lizzy, handle that motherfucker!

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:00.787
Oh, fuck!

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.666
Oh, baby, I fucked
that bitch up!

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:15.969
Jesus Christ!

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:19.539
Fuck!

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:31.818
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:42.762
We lost them, sug!

01:31:42.764 --> 01:31:44.030
Oh, shit.

01:31:44.032 --> 01:31:45.932
We're gonna make it, baby.
We're gonna make it!

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:51.905
Fuck, he's still coming!

01:31:54.877 --> 01:31:56.276
Let's give him a 180!

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:06.253
Shit!

01:32:06.255 --> 01:32:07.954
Turn around!
Turn around!

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:08.996
I can't make it!

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:12.259
Baby,

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.261
kill that motherfucker!

01:32:19.767 --> 01:32:20.767
Fuck!

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:28.275
Shoot the fucking engine!

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:31.578
Fucking die!

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.246
Now, get us
the fuck out of here!

01:32:40.087 --> 01:32:41.154
Fuck!

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:43.890
I got no eyes!

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:45.292
I can't see shit!

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.655
Drop the weapon, lizzy!

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.902
Okay. Okay.

01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:32.772
Hey, breach.

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:37.143
You killed my team.

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:40.714
Why, lizzy? Why?

01:33:40.716 --> 01:33:43.350
Because they stole
my money! Huh!

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:46.386
They fucking robbed me!

01:33:46.388 --> 01:33:48.722
After everything I put up with!

01:33:48.724 --> 01:33:51.191
It was my money
and they took it,
and I couldn't find it!

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:54.027
I said, "fuck them."

01:33:55.731 --> 01:33:58.765
I took the money.
I took it.

01:33:58.767 --> 01:34:00.133
You took the money?

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.369
What does that mean?

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:04.704
Why?

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:10.043
Mexico.

01:34:11.178 --> 01:34:13.046
This is about fucking Mexico?

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:17.217
Your family is
never coming home!

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:19.986
What is she talking about?

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:22.389
And nothing you do

01:34:22.391 --> 01:34:23.923
will ever change that!

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:27.060
You hear me?

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:33.400
What the fuck was that?

01:34:37.372 --> 01:34:41.107
Just be a good
girl and walk away.

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.881
Hey! Hey!

01:34:47.883 --> 01:34:48.923
What the fuck...

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.017
I can't.

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:54.387
Pull it together.
You okay?
Yeah.

01:34:54.389 --> 01:34:56.389
Okay, you hurt?
Anything?
No, I'm okay.

01:34:56.391 --> 01:34:57.424
All right, just take it easy.

01:34:57.426 --> 01:35:00.260
Where's breacher?
He's right there.

01:35:00.262 --> 01:35:01.863
Where the fuck is he?
He was right there.

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.864
We've got three vics.

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:05.932
We've got to find him.

01:35:05.934 --> 01:35:07.133
Shit!

01:35:07.135 --> 01:35:08.368
Find breacher!

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:09.810
You heard her,
spread out!

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:13.873
- Check the truck!
- On it. On it.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:15.909
No! Nothing!

01:35:15.911 --> 01:35:18.445
I don't see him.
I don't see him.

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:24.951
What the fuck happened,
Caroline?

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:28.722
What the fuck did you do?

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:31.464
Mmm.

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:44.010
You're mine.

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:55.588
Your wife.

01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:58.191
I was the last to have her.

01:39:58.193 --> 01:39:59.325
You can't take that back.

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.028
I can take your family.

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:05.999
But I'm not like you.
