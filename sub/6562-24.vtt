00:51.233 --> 00:52.733
IMPRISONING
THE BAND BIG TIME RUSH

00:52.733 --> 00:55.833
WHILE TRYING TO SABOTAGE
THEIR FIRST CONCERT PERFORMANCE?

00:55.833 --> 00:57.867
- ABSOLUTELY.

00:57.867 --> 01:01.933
FROM NOW ON, I WANT TO FOCUS
ON MY MUSIC, NOT THEIRS.

01:01.933 --> 01:05.433

[computer chirps]

02:12.933 --> 02:15.967
[all cheering]

02:15.967 --> 02:18.200
- AND NOW WE MAKE
OUR CEREMONIAL MARCH

02:18.200 --> 02:22.933
TO OUR DIGITAL STORAGE ROOM
AND GRAB OUR BIG TIME HARD DRIVE

02:22.933 --> 02:25.067
AND GET IT
TO THE CD-MAKING PLACE.

02:25.067 --> 02:26.767
- LOOKING FOR THIS?

02:26.767 --> 02:28.067
- HAWK!

02:28.067 --> 02:29.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.867
- WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE THAT?

02:30.867 --> 02:33.667
- OH, I'M CRAZY NOW.

02:33.667 --> 02:37.667
AND I'M STEALING YOUR HARD DRIVE
TO GET MY REVENGE.

02:37.667 --> 02:40.267
- GIVE US THAT HARD DRIVE
RIGHT NOW.

02:40.267 --> 02:41.300
- NO.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.400
- THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR...

02:43.400 --> 02:44.433
HIM.

02:44.433 --> 02:45.467
- NO, IT DOESN'T,

02:45.467 --> 02:47.333
'CAUSE THERE'S SIX OF US

02:47.333 --> 02:48.667
AND ONLY ONE OF YOU.

02:50.767 --> 02:51.800
- GUESS AGAIN.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.733
HAWK-MEN!

02:55.633 --> 02:57.467
YOU KNOW, JAIL GIVES YOU
LOTS OF TIME

02:57.467 --> 03:03.100
TO DESIGN COOL HENCHMAN COSTUMES
AND PLAN COOL ESCAPES.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.633
CAW!

03:08.433 --> 03:11.367
[all coughing]

03:11.367 --> 03:12.433
- HE'S GONE!

03:12.433 --> 03:14.867
- AND SO IS OUR ENTIRE
SECOND ALBUM!

03:16.833 --> 03:19.767
[eerie gurgling]

03:25.600 --> 03:27.567
- [screaming]

03:29.733 --> 03:31.867
- OKAY,
TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY,

03:31.867 --> 03:33.067
DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED.

03:33.067 --> 03:34.667
- I WAS DOING THE DISHES.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.233
I HEARD A STRANGE NOISE
COMING FROM THE SINK.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.433
I LOOKED IN THE SINK.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.733
I SAW IT, I SCREAMED,
AND I SENT MY DAUGHTER

03:39.733 --> 03:41.733
TO THE PARK
SO IT WOULDN'T GET HER.

03:41.733 --> 03:42.833
- IT'S BACK.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.367
- WHAT'S BACK?
- NOTHING.

03:44.367 --> 03:45.567
NOTHING'S BACK.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.167
WE'LL FILL OUT
THIS MAINTENANCE REPORT,

03:47.167 --> 03:48.633
TAKE CARE
OF THAT LITTLE CLOG ASAP.

03:48.633 --> 03:49.567
BYE.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.267
- WE HAVE
TO SHUT THAT WATER OFF NOW,

03:53.267 --> 03:55.067
OR IT'LL SPREAD LIKE BEFORE.

03:55.067 --> 03:57.933
- WHY DON'T YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH
BEFORE YOU CAUSE A PANIC?

03:57.933 --> 03:59.167
- ARE YOU FORGETTING
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME?

03:59.167 --> 04:00.733
- THIS IS NOTHING LIKE
THE LAST TIME.

04:00.733 --> 04:03.667
[rustling, clanking,
and groaning]

04:05.300 --> 04:06.667
[siren wailing]

04:06.667 --> 04:10.500
[indistinct speech
over police radio]

04:10.500 --> 04:13.067
- RIGHT NOW, WE CAN'T
POSITIVELY IDENTIFY ANYONE,

04:13.067 --> 04:14.500
EXCEPT THAT IT'S--
- HAWK!

04:14.500 --> 04:16.933
ARREST HIM! IT'S HAWK!

04:16.933 --> 04:21.167
- EXCEPT THAT IT'S SOMEONE
DISGUISED AS A NUT BAG.

04:21.167 --> 04:24.167
NOW, WE'LL DO A FULL
INVESTIGATION AS SOON AS WE CAN.

04:24.167 --> 04:25.533
all: AS SOON AS YOU CAN?

04:25.533 --> 04:26.633
- WE NEED TO SHIP OUR ALBUM,

04:26.633 --> 04:28.633
WHICH IS ON THAT HARD DRIVE,
TODAY.

04:28.633 --> 04:29.700
- OH, REALLY?

04:29.700 --> 04:30.633
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

04:30.633 --> 04:31.867
LET ME GET OUR SPECIAL

04:31.867 --> 04:34.800
BOY BAND TASK FORCE
ON THIS ASAP.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.233
- OH, SWEET.
- YES!

04:36.233 --> 04:37.800
- HE'S BEING SARCASTIC.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.900
- MM-HMM, HE IS.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.067
BESIDES, I HAVE A LOT

04:40.067 --> 04:41.600
OF OTHER CRIMES
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH TODAY:

04:41.600 --> 04:42.667
A NAKED MUGGER,

04:42.667 --> 04:44.233
A PAWN STORE HOLDUP,

04:44.233 --> 04:45.633
AND THREE CATS STUCK IN TREES.

04:45.633 --> 04:49.333
- WE GOT A 477
ON CURTIS AND VINE.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.067
- MAKE THAT FOUR CATS.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.567
GET OUT THERE, BROWN.

04:52.567 --> 04:55.900
BESIDES, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DOWNLOAD YOUR BACKUP FILES?

04:55.900 --> 04:57.833
YOU DO HAVE BACKUP FILES, RIGHT?

05:01.067 --> 05:03.067
- CONTROL ROOM!
[all yelling]

05:03.067 --> 05:04.567
- SEARCH
"BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS OUT,"

05:04.567 --> 05:07.467
AND THE FILE SHOULD COME UP.

05:07.467 --> 05:08.733
- [shrieks]

05:08.733 --> 05:09.700
HE MUST HAVE HACKED IN

05:09.700 --> 05:11.300
AND STOLEN ALL OUR SONG FILES.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.833
- WAIT, WHY IS
BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS OUT

05:12.833 --> 05:15.533
SHOWING UP ON A WEB LINK?

05:15.533 --> 05:17.667
- WHO'S
"HOT NEW ARTIST ZWAGGER"?

05:17.667 --> 05:19.500
- AND WHY CAN YOU PREORDER
BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS OUT

05:19.500 --> 05:20.733
ON HIS HOT NEW ALBUM?

05:20.733 --> 05:23.067
- [gasps]
AND PARALYZED AND SUPERSTAR

05:23.067 --> 05:24.500
AND ALL OF OUR SONGS!

05:24.500 --> 05:26.100
- WHAT LABEL IS HE ON?

05:29.467 --> 05:30.700
HAWK'S RECORDING OUR NEWS SONGS

05:30.700 --> 05:32.733
AND IS GONNA RELEASE THEM
BEFORE WE DO.

05:32.733 --> 05:36.700
[all screaming]

05:36.700 --> 05:39.833
- FOR THE LAST TIME,
I'M NOT SHUTTING THE WATER DOWN.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.567
- OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:47.567 --> 05:50.167
BECAUSE MY MOM WON'T TELL ME.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.700
- SUPER-CLOG IS BACK.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.533
LOOK, I WANT YOU,
YOUR MOM, AND THE BOYS

05:53.533 --> 05:55.300
TO GET OUT OF TOWN
FOR A FEW DAYS.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.967
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE NO TIME TO EXPLAIN.

05:57.967 --> 05:59.700
- SUPER-WHAT?

05:59.700 --> 06:02.067
- OKAY, I HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

06:02.067 --> 06:04.467
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,
A CLOG LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN

06:04.467 --> 06:06.367
ALMOST DESTROYED THE PALMWOODS.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.233
IT OOZED OUT OF SINKS
AND SPLATTERED OUT OF SHOWERS.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.133
RESIDENTS MOVED OUT IN DROVES.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.433
THIS PLACE WAS SHUT DOWN
FOR A YEAR,

06:13.433 --> 06:16.200
BUT THE CLOG WAS NEVER FOUND.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.933
AND NOW IT'S BACK.

06:17.933 --> 06:21.267
- A SINK CLOG
OF GREASE AND HAIR

06:21.267 --> 06:23.100
ALMOST DESTROYED
THE PALMWOODS?

06:23.100 --> 06:24.700
- AND I HAVE TO STOP IT

06:24.700 --> 06:26.933
BEFORE IT STOPS US.

06:26.933 --> 06:28.700
- SUPER-CLOG.

06:28.700 --> 06:29.800
PLEASE.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.133
[eerie gurgling]

06:32.200 --> 06:33.300
[groaning]

06:36.500 --> 06:37.867
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A BIGGER PLUNGER.

06:39.900 --> 06:44.200
- * GOT TO CRANK
THE MUSIC LOUD *

06:44.200 --> 06:46.833
* BABY, BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS OUT

06:46.833 --> 06:49.200
* BLOW YOUR SPEAKERS OUT

06:49.200 --> 06:52.133
- NOW, THAT'S
WHAT I CALL ZWAGGER.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.833
ONLY NINE MORE SONGS
TO RECORD,

06:53.833 --> 06:57.133
AND WE'VE GOT
YOUR SMASH DEBUT ALBUM,

06:57.133 --> 06:59.533
AND I'VE GOT REVENGE
ON BIG TIME RUSH.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.800
- UM, DID YOU JUST SAY,
"REVENGE ON BIG TIME RUSH"?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.167
- WHAT? NO, NO, NO.

07:06.167 --> 07:08.333
WHY WOULD I SAY THAT?
I SAID--

07:08.333 --> 07:09.433
UH--

07:09.433 --> 07:10.300
CAW!

07:17.600 --> 07:19.100
- OH, OKAY.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.467
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

07:20.467 --> 07:22.333
- I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
CALL THE POLICE AGAIN.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.067
- WHAT, SO THEY CAN TELL US
TO WAIT A FEW DAYS

07:24.067 --> 07:25.967
WHILE THEY SAVE SOME CATS?

07:25.967 --> 07:28.567
- I THINK IT'S TIME...

07:28.567 --> 07:30.867
FOR HIM.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.300
- NO, NO, NO.
- NO, NO, NO.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.833
- THE ONLY WAY
TO DEFEAT SUPERVILLAINS

07:35.833 --> 07:38.833
IS WITH SUPERHEROES.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.833
- ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS GET INTO HAWK RECORDS

07:41.833 --> 07:43.100
AND STEAL BACK
OUR HARD DRIVE...

07:45.333 --> 07:46.800
NORMAL BURGLAR STYLE.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.067
- YOU DO REALIZE
THAT BREAKING AND ENTERING

07:49.067 --> 07:50.467
IS AGAINST THE LAW, RIGHT?

07:50.467 --> 07:52.500
- MAY I REMIND YOU
THAT IN THAT STUDIO

07:52.500 --> 07:56.067
IS THE ONLY COPY
OF BTR'S SECOND ALBUM?

07:56.067 --> 07:58.667
NOW, WHO'S IN?

07:58.667 --> 08:00.933
- GIVE ME THE BOLT CUTTERS.

08:00.933 --> 08:03.067
- SLEDGEHAMMER, PLEASE.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.067
- KELLY,

08:04.067 --> 08:05.567
KEEP THE VAN
READY AND RUNNING.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.267
AND YOU...

08:07.267 --> 08:08.867
CAN WEAR ONE BANDANA.

08:10.367 --> 08:11.633
- LET'S GET OUR SONGS BACK.

08:11.633 --> 08:12.867
[all cheering]

08:16.433 --> 08:18.633
[eerie gurgling]

08:18.633 --> 08:20.900
- OKAY, PLUNGIE,
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.433
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T NEED
A BIGGER PLUNGER?

08:22.433 --> 08:24.500
- SHH.
YOU'RE PSYCHING HIM OUT.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.400
NOW ALL WE'RE MISSING
IS THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.600
SURPRISE!

08:28.600 --> 08:31.733
AAH! OOH!

08:31.733 --> 08:33.667
STRONGER THAN BEFORE.

08:33.667 --> 08:36.400
[eerie gurgling]

08:36.400 --> 08:37.867
[echoing belch]

08:37.867 --> 08:39.067
PLUNGIE!

08:39.067 --> 08:41.400
NO!

08:41.400 --> 08:42.333
- BOB.

08:44.967 --> 08:46.200
IT'S TOO LATE.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.233
- HE WAS SO YOUNG
AND FULL OF SUCTION.

08:49.233 --> 08:50.667
- FOCUS.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.667
WHAT WILL IT DO NEXT?

08:52.667 --> 08:56.867
- WELL, IT KNOWS I'M AFTER IT,
SO IT'LL PROBABLY RETREAT

08:56.867 --> 08:59.733
INTO THE PIPES,
WAITING TO STRIKE AGAIN.

08:59.733 --> 09:00.733
[pipes rattling]

09:04.800 --> 09:05.867
[screeching growl]

09:05.867 --> 09:09.067
- [screaming]

09:09.067 --> 09:11.067
- AH!

09:11.067 --> 09:12.867
- OKAY, EVERYBODY SPREAD OUT,

09:12.867 --> 09:14.700
AND FIND THAT HARD DRIVE.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.200
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.167
LET'S TRY PARALYZED
ONE MORE TIME.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.800
THIS TIME,
A LITTLE MORE ZWAGGER.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.733
- OH, NO.
THEY'RE ALREADY ON SONG THREE.

09:24.733 --> 09:28.267
- * YOU,
YOU WALKED INTO THE ROOM *

09:28.267 --> 09:29.333
[music stops]
- OH.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.067
HURRY THIS UP
BEFORE WE GET CAUGHT.

09:31.067 --> 09:33.067
COME ON.

09:33.067 --> 09:34.133
- OKAY, WE CAN'T HURRY UP,

09:34.133 --> 09:36.067
BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND
THE HARD DRIVE.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.067
- THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT THINKING

09:38.067 --> 09:39.967
LIKE AN EVIL PRODUCER.

09:39.967 --> 09:42.833
AND I DO
BECAUSE I SORT OF AM ONE.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.533
SHBINGO.

09:50.567 --> 09:52.167
[all gasping]

09:54.100 --> 09:55.467
- WE GOT OUR SONGS BACK.

09:55.467 --> 09:56.933
- YES!
- WHOO!

09:56.933 --> 09:58.167
[siren wailing]
- WHOA!

09:58.167 --> 09:59.400
- THERE THEY ARE, COMMISSIONER.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.767
THEY'VE BROKEN INTO MY STUDIO,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.833
AND NOW THEY'RE STEALING
MY PROPERTY.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.133
- HE STOLE IT FROM US FIRST!

10:04.133 --> 10:06.167
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

10:06.167 --> 10:08.900
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT THAT IS MY HARD DRIVE.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.833
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- YOU ARE A LIAR!

10:10.833 --> 10:13.367
- NO, YOU DID.
NO. NOT.

10:13.367 --> 10:14.933
- QUIET!

10:14.933 --> 10:17.233
THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY
TO SETTLE THIS.

10:17.233 --> 10:20.933
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT'S
ON THE HARD DRIVE, SHALL WE?

10:20.933 --> 10:21.933
- YEAH!

10:21.933 --> 10:23.867
AND THEN YOU'LL HEAR US SINGING,

10:23.867 --> 10:25.300
AND HE'LL GO TO JAIL.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.967
- DEAR HAWK'S VIDEO DIARY,

10:28.967 --> 10:31.867
I AM SO HAPPY TODAY
THAT I WROTE A SONG.

10:31.867 --> 10:34.633
IT'S CALLED
I LOVE THE POLICE.

10:34.633 --> 10:39.500
* POLICE ARE GOOD,
THEY GUARD OUR NEIGHBORHOOD *

10:39.500 --> 10:43.967
* POLICE ARE NICE,
I THINK THEY'RE COOL AS ICE *

10:43.967 --> 10:46.467
- OH, THIS IS BAD.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.333
- THIS IS SO BAD!

10:48.333 --> 10:51.033
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

10:55.400 --> 10:56.600
[bluesy harmonica music]

10:56.600 --> 10:58.200
- * WE GOT THROWN IN JAIL

10:58.200 --> 10:59.533
*

10:59.533 --> 11:01.067
* AND I KNOW--

11:01.067 --> 11:02.600
- NOT HELPING!

11:02.600 --> 11:04.167
- EVERYBODY CALM DOWN!

11:04.167 --> 11:05.300
WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.067
- THIS WAS HAWK'S PLAN
ALL ALONG:

11:07.067 --> 11:09.767
A SUPER DISGUISE
SO HE COULDN'T GET IDENTIFIED

11:09.767 --> 11:11.133
AND A FAKE HARD DRIVE

11:11.133 --> 11:13.967
SO WE'D GET BUSTED
AND END UP IN HERE.

11:13.967 --> 11:15.967
- BUT NOW...

11:15.967 --> 11:17.067
WE'RE BREAKING OUT OF HERE.

11:22.633 --> 11:24.100
- WE REALLY NEED
TO GET HIM SOME HELP.

11:25.333 --> 11:26.400
- IT WORKED!

11:26.400 --> 11:27.867
- BIG TIME RUSH.
- WAIT.

11:27.867 --> 11:29.967
- YOU MADE BAIL.

11:29.967 --> 11:32.433
all: KELLY!

11:32.433 --> 11:34.300
- YAY!

11:34.300 --> 11:35.867
NOW, STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

11:35.867 --> 11:38.667
I AM LOOKING
INTO YOUR HAD DRIVE ROBBERY,

11:38.667 --> 11:42.300
BUT THIS IS THE LAPD,
AND WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF CRIME.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.833
LAST YEAR ALONE,
WE HAD A B--

11:43.833 --> 11:47.067
- WE HAVE ANOTHER 477
AT SUNSET AND VINE.

11:47.067 --> 11:49.067
- WILL SOMEONE PLEASE
SAVE THE TREE CAT?

11:52.933 --> 11:55.300
AND I BETTER NOT CATCH YOU
ANYWHERE NEAR HAWK RECORDS,

11:55.300 --> 11:57.833
OR NEXT TIME,
THERE WILL BE NO BAIL.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.700
- YES, SIR, MR. COMMISSIONER.

11:59.700 --> 12:03.200
WE WILL STAY AWAY
FROM HAWK RECORDS.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.833
OKAY, HOW DO WE GET
BACK INTO HAWK RECORDS?

12:06.833 --> 12:08.933
- WEREN'T YOU IDIOTS
JUST IN JAIL?

12:08.933 --> 12:10.867
[evil laughter]

12:10.867 --> 12:13.567
- AH, I CAN ALMOST HEAR HIM
LAUGHING AT US NOW.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.067
[evil laughter]

12:15.067 --> 12:16.500
- WAIT!

12:16.500 --> 12:18.967
- THERE ARE THREE THINGS
EVERY SUPERVILLAIN MUST DO:

12:18.967 --> 12:20.233
LAUGH EVILLY,

12:20.233 --> 12:21.800
SEEK REVENGE,

12:21.800 --> 12:24.300
AND SHOW UP
ON VARIOUS SCREENS UNEXPECTEDLY.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.067
- YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY
WITH THIS, HAWK.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.967
- OH, BUT I AM.

12:27.967 --> 12:30.867
IN FACT, I'VE JUST PUT
A LITTLE ZWAGGER

12:30.867 --> 12:33.233
ON YOUR SONG SUPERSTAR,

12:33.233 --> 12:36.133
WHICH IS GOING TO TURN HIM
INTO A SUPERSTAR.

12:36.133 --> 12:37.367
- THAT'S SONG SIX!

12:37.367 --> 12:38.867
HE'S HALFWAY THERE.

12:38.867 --> 12:41.433
- DID YOU SAY,
"HIS SONG SUPERSTAR"?

12:41.433 --> 12:43.100
- OKAY, AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS

12:43.100 --> 12:45.867
AS A TITLE
FOR MY NEW CD?

12:45.867 --> 12:48.400
IT'S CALLED CAW!

12:50.067 --> 12:51.567
- WE WILL NOT LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

12:51.567 --> 12:54.500
- YEAH, WELL, WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO GO TO HAWK RECORDS, EITHER.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.067
- WOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD SAY THIS...

12:57.600 --> 12:58.700
JAMES!

12:58.700 --> 13:00.467
- WE WON'T BE THERE.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.700
BUT HE WILL.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.733
- HOW DOES HE DO THAT?

13:13.733 --> 13:14.900
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.133
- OKAY, SO BANDANA MAN
IS GOING TO DEFEAT HAWK

13:17.133 --> 13:18.667
AND HIS HAWK-MEN BY HIMSELF?

13:18.667 --> 13:19.667
- NO.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.733
THE SUPERTASTIC SUPER-6 WILL.

13:21.733 --> 13:24.067
- WHO'S THE SUPERTASTIC
SUPER-6?

13:24.067 --> 13:25.233
- I'M LOOKING AT THEM.

13:27.067 --> 13:30.667
- SO YOU WANT US TO DISGUISE
OURSELVES AS SUPERHEROES,

13:30.667 --> 13:32.800
PULL A SURPRISE RAID
AT HAWK RECORDS,

13:32.800 --> 13:35.967
AND TAKE OUR HARD DRIVE BACK
BY FORCE?

13:35.967 --> 13:38.367
- DOES ANYBODY HAVE
A BETTER IDEA?

13:38.367 --> 13:39.733
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

13:41.867 --> 13:44.867
[eerie gurgling and groaning]

13:44.867 --> 13:46.933
- OKAY, NOW I THINK
IT'S IN THE LOBBY.

13:46.933 --> 13:49.400
- YEAH, AND GETTING BIGGER.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.600
THAT'S IT!

13:50.600 --> 13:51.533
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

13:55.800 --> 13:57.467
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:57.467 --> 13:58.933
- IF BITTERS
WON'T SHUT OFF THE WATER,

13:58.933 --> 13:59.867
THEN WE WILL.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.667
[gurgling stops]

14:06.667 --> 14:08.600
NOW IT'S TRAPPED
AND CAN'T MOVE.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.600
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.133
- SAVING YOUR LIFE.

14:13.133 --> 14:17.300
- ALL THAT'S HAPPENED TODAY WAS,
YOUR MOM GOT A LITTLE DIRTY,

14:17.300 --> 14:18.800
AND YOU LOST
YOUR LITTLE PLUNGIE.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.767
- [gasps]
LITTLE P--

14:21.767 --> 14:23.333
DON'T TURN THAT VALVE.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.800
THAT'S JUST WHAT IT WANTS.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.500
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

14:32.233 --> 14:33.233
[pipes clanking]

14:33.233 --> 14:36.167
[eerie gurgling]

14:48.933 --> 14:49.967
[loud retching]

14:49.967 --> 14:51.567
[woman screaming]

14:51.567 --> 14:53.100
[people screaming]

14:53.100 --> 14:56.933
THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC.
REMAIN CALM.

14:56.933 --> 14:59.767
THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC.

14:59.767 --> 15:01.867
GET RID OF IT.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.533
GET RID OF IT!

15:03.533 --> 15:05.833
- AND I WANT IN.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.100
'CAUSE THIS THING
IS SO GOING DOWN.

15:10.667 --> 15:11.900
- OKAY.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.067
THIS IS EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT
IN THE STUDIO.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.533
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE DOING THIS.

15:15.533 --> 15:18.233
- SUPERTASTIC SUPER-6,
SUIT UP!

15:18.233 --> 15:19.967

ANYTHING IN THE PILE.

17:45.467 --> 17:46.867
- WELL, YOU CAN'T GO LIKE THAT.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.067
YOU'LL GET RECOGNIZED.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.433
- UGH, FINE.

17:50.433 --> 17:52.133
I'LL BE BOWL-HEAD.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.567
- ALL RIGHT,
WE ALL KNOW THE PLAN.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.733
- WE POWER PLUNGE
THE THREE MAIN POINTS OF ENTRY.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.200
- CREATING A TURBO STREAM
OF WATER

18:21.200 --> 18:23.267
THAT FORCES SUPER-CLOG
UP THROUGH THE PIPES.

18:23.267 --> 18:24.667
- AND ITS ONLY ESCAPE

18:24.667 --> 18:27.067
IS THE VENTILATION SHAFT
IN THE ROOF,

18:27.067 --> 18:29.867
WHERE IT WILL SHOOT OUT
AND MEET ITS SUN-DRIED DEMISE.

18:29.867 --> 18:31.733

18:53.333 --> 18:55.333
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CLOG.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.300
[eerie gurgling]

18:57.300 --> 19:00.500

YOU ARE GOING DOWN.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.433
I MEAN UP!

19:03.700 --> 19:07.233
[motor whirring]

19:07.233 --> 19:09.900

YAH-HA!

19:27.900 --> 19:29.367
all: OH!

19:31.833 --> 19:35.067
[cheers and applause]

19:35.067 --> 19:38.667
- WE CAN ALL
USE THE BATHROOMS AGAIN!

19:38.667 --> 19:39.767
- YEAH.

19:39.767 --> 19:42.133
- I CAN WASH DISHES AGAIN!

19:42.133 --> 19:44.233
WAIT.

19:44.233 --> 19:47.067
- SADLY, THIS VICTORY
IS BITTERSWEET,

19:47.067 --> 19:49.400
AS I HAVE LOST
MY BEST FRIEND.

19:50.633 --> 19:51.800
PLUNGIE!

19:51.800 --> 19:53.300
PLUNGIE, OH.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.767
- WELL, THIS STORY
IS WRAPPING UP QUITE NICELY.

19:55.767 --> 19:56.700
- NO, IT'S NOT.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
- YES!

20:01.500 --> 20:03.100
ALL 12 SONGS ARE COMPLETE.

20:03.100 --> 20:07.233
NOW TO UPLOAD YOUR ALBUM
TO THE WEB AND GET MY REVENGE.

20:07.233 --> 20:09.767
- THINK AGAIN, HAWK.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.000
- WHO ARE THEY?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.867
- WE ARE
THE SUPERTASTIC SUPER-6.

20:14.933 --> 20:16.200
- YOU SAID "SUPER" TWICE.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.033
all:
YOU BET HE DID.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.700
- AND WE WANT
OUR SONGS BACK NOW.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.567
- YEAH. NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

20:23.933 --> 20:24.900
CAW!

20:31.000 --> 20:32.633
- BA-HA-HA-HA!

20:35.467 --> 20:38.200
- [grunting]

20:38.200 --> 20:39.133
OH!

20:51.667 --> 20:52.667
- SLAPSHOT!

20:55.233 --> 20:57.067
- TIME TO GET
THE HAWK OUT OF HERE.

20:59.433 --> 21:01.333
- YEAH, I GOT BOWL POWERS NOW.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.167
[all yelling]

21:04.167 --> 21:05.333
[siren wailing]

21:05.333 --> 21:07.100
all: WHOA!

21:08.167 --> 21:09.500
- DO YOU SEE THIS?

21:09.500 --> 21:10.900
CAN YOU BELIEVE
WHAT I'M SEEING?

21:10.900 --> 21:15.100
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU GUYS
TO STAY AWAY FROM HAWK RECORDS.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.500
- COMMISSIONER, THEY BROKE IN
AND ATTACKED ME.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.433
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

21:19.433 --> 21:21.833
- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.200
- YES...

21:23.200 --> 21:26.600
ARREST HIM FOR STEALING
BIG TIME RUSH'S SECOND ALBUM.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.700
- WH-WHAT?

21:27.700 --> 21:29.433
NO, YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

21:29.433 --> 21:32.100
- WE CHECKED LOCAL COSTUME SHOPS
TO SEE

21:32.100 --> 21:37.600
WHO BOUGHT A HAWK COSTUME,
AND WE FOUND THIS RECEIPT.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.067
- WELL, THAT COULD BE
ANY HAWK!

21:40.067 --> 21:42.567
- AND WE FOUND
YOUR COMMENT CARD,

21:42.567 --> 21:47.133
WHERE UNDER REASON FOR PURCHASE,
YOU CHECKED "REVENGE."

21:47.133 --> 21:48.400
- WHO CARES?

21:48.400 --> 21:50.500
YOU'LL NEVER FIND
YOUR PRECIOUS HARD DRIVE.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.567
- YOU MEAN THIS ONE?

21:53.567 --> 21:54.900
HE'S BEEN TALKING
TO IT ALL DAY,

21:54.900 --> 21:58.800
SAYING, "REVENGE IS MINE,"
AND FREAKING ME OUT!

21:58.800 --> 22:01.600
- YOU TRAITOR!

22:01.600 --> 22:03.133
I'LL GET YOU, BIG TIME RUSH.

22:03.133 --> 22:05.900
I'LL BE BACK.
CAW-CAW!

22:05.900 --> 22:07.067
CAW-CAW!

22:15.567 --> 22:17.133
[all cheering]

22:17.133 --> 22:18.067
- HEY!

22:19.500 --> 22:21.933
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU GUYS
I WOULD HANDLE THIS.

22:21.933 --> 22:23.900
all:
ARE WE IN TROUBLE?

22:23.900 --> 22:24.900
- NO.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.733
IN FACT, I COULD USE

22:26.733 --> 22:28.067
AN ACTION SQUAD LIKE YOU

22:28.067 --> 22:31.133
THAT I CAN CALL WHEN DISASTER
STRIKES THIS FINE CITY

22:31.133 --> 22:32.800
AND IT'S TOO MUCH
FOR ME TO HANDLE.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.100
- WELL, COMMISSIONER,
I THINK I SPEAK

22:35.100 --> 22:37.133
FOR THE ENTIRE
SUPERTASTIC SUPER-6

22:37.133 --> 22:40.433
WHEN I SAY WE'RE WILLING
AND READY TO SERVE.

22:41.967 --> 22:43.167
[cat meowing]

22:43.167 --> 22:44.967
- HERE, KITTY, KITTY.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.833
[cat meowing]
- COME ON, KITTY.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.067
- OH, LET ME JUST
THROW THE BOWL AT HIM.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.400
- NO!
- NO!

22:50.400 --> 22:53.367
- JUST GRAB THE BRANCH!
- I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.
