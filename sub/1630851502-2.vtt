18:47.604 --> 18:49.345
So good to be with you today.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.956
Hey, can I have just a moment
of your time and talk to you

18:52.000 --> 18:55.395
about this great new invention
called HOTWORX?

18:55.438 --> 18:57.701
Call the number
at the bottom of your screen.

18:57.745 --> 19:01.401
I like that ambassador thing.
It's got a good ring to it.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.054
Ambassador Bradshaw.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.883
In the future,
I'm gonna--from now on,

19:05.927 --> 19:11.367
if I do any more endorsements,
I am going to use ambassador.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.934
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.762
Oh, there you go,
that's how you do it.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.939
- That's really good, actually.
- Thank you.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.680
- Oh.

19:22.726 --> 19:29.385
<i>♪</i>

19:29.429 --> 19:32.345
- ♪ Ba-ba-ba-boo

19:32.388 --> 19:35.304
- What are you doing?
- ♪ My friend

19:35.348 --> 19:38.568
- Are you having a party?
- Since this didn't go well.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.787
- What's that?

19:39.830 --> 19:42.616
- Erin didn't quite go
with my oysters,

19:42.659 --> 19:45.358
so I decided we'll eat 'em.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.968
- I don't eat oysters.
- Hey.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.404
- No.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.666
- Hey.
- I'm not eating oysters.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.799
- But you don't know--
- You can have 'em.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.931
- But there's a--
- I'm not eating 'em.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.586
- There's a--
- Sorry, it's raw.

19:56.630 --> 19:57.979
- Oh.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.851
- Ew, that is just disgusting.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.114
That's like third grade.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.639
- I don't know
why you won't eat an oyster.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.685
- Probably the same reason
Erin didn't want them.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.078
- Dogs won't even eat
an oyster.

20:10.121 --> 20:15.170
- Well, there you go.
- They are an aphrodisiac.

20:15.214 --> 20:19.087
- I don't think
it's an aphrodisiac.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.089
- What is it called?
- Aphrodisiac.

20:21.132 --> 20:23.613
- Apho-pho-disiac.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.006
You know, my biological
grandfather clock

20:25.049 --> 20:26.529
is ticking away.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.879
I'd love to have
another grandbaby in the house.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.403
- It'll happen when it happens.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.882
You gotta just
leave them alone.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.494
- I know that.

20:34.537 --> 20:35.973
<i>Now, America I know
what you're thinking.</i>

20:36.017 --> 20:37.888
This oyster thing
was a total flop.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.499
- It was cute.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.935
- Did you think it was cute,
truly, babe?

20:40.978 --> 20:45.766
- No, but--
-

20:45.809 --> 20:47.550
Thanks for backing me
on that one.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.685
Holy cow.

20:51.728 --> 20:54.601
- Horseradish.
- Whoa!

20:54.644 --> 20:57.125
Got it right up the nose,
I did.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.388
I thought it was coconut.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.911
Whoa!
