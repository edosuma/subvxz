07:57.852 --> 08:00.313
<i>When you</i>
<i>arrived there, Laverne,</i>

08:00.396 --> 08:01.856
<i>what did you find?</i>

08:01.939 --> 08:02.982
<i>A female.</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:05.860
-
<i>-I asked if she's sick.</i>

08:06.569 --> 08:09.655
<i>-He says, "Worse than that, she's dead."</i>
-

08:14.410 --> 08:15.745
W<i>hen you entered the lot…</i>

08:15.828 --> 08:18.289
-
-…<i>what did you see, if anything?</i>

08:18.915 --> 08:21.792
<i> I seen John</i>
<i>standing with a young lady.</i>

08:22.960 --> 08:28.132
<i>And they appeared</i>
<i>to be arguing in a playing way.</i>

14:28.325 --> 14:31.036
Yesterday, in an exclusive interview
with Channel 2 News,

14:31.120 --> 14:32.663
alleged murderer Keith Jesperson

14:32.746 --> 14:35.124
confessed to being
the so-called Happy Face Killer.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.710
-Make a hole, people. Let's go.
-

14:56.729 --> 14:58.355
<i>There is no doubt in my mind.</i>

14:59.773 --> 15:00.608
<i>I am him.</i>

15:02.401 --> 15:03.819
<i>I am the Happy Face Killer.</i>

15:13.078 --> 15:16.665
<i>Forty-year-old Keith Jesperson</i>
<i>came to court today in Clark County</i>

15:16.749 --> 15:18.417
<i>to get something off his chest.</i>

15:18.500 --> 15:20.794
You understand
the consequences of a guilty plea?

15:20.878 --> 15:22.296
Yes, I do.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.313
 He's confessed
to as many as eight murders.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.649
Does he plan to plead guilty to any more?

15:41.732 --> 15:44.109
Uh, that's a little too early to tell.

16:35.744 --> 16:39.164
<i>I'm coming forward with the truth.</i>
<i>I wanna make sure it's out there.</i>

17:59.495 --> 18:01.955
The date is
September 29th, 1995.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.041
The time is 10:35.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.543
Present at the Clark County
Sheriff's Office…

18:06.627 --> 18:09.004
-
-…Defense attorney Tom Phelan,

18:09.546 --> 18:12.549
Deputy DA Jim McIntyre,
Multnomah County Sheriff's Office,

18:13.300 --> 18:15.928
Det. Chris Peterson,
Multnomah County Sheriff's Office…

18:56.510 --> 18:58.220
Ahem. I understand that

18:59.388 --> 19:03.433
you wanna talk to us about a homicide
that occurred in, uh, Multnomah County,

19:03.517 --> 19:05.102
uh, in 1990, is that correct?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.895
-That is correct. Yes, I do.
-Okay.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.862
Okay, at some point,

19:15.821 --> 19:17.948
did you meet a female
that you, uh, killed?

19:18.657 --> 19:21.160
-Yes, I did.
-Do you know what her name was?

19:21.910 --> 19:23.412
I found out it was Taunja…

19:24.830 --> 19:26.623
-Bennett.
-

19:27.666 --> 19:31.003
I went out for a walk, and I decided
I'd go out and play some pool.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.130
Walked in the tavern,

19:33.213 --> 19:36.341
and, uh, this gal walked over

19:36.425 --> 19:38.218
and gave me a hug like I was--

19:38.302 --> 19:40.137
like I was somebody she knew.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.806
I just thought she was overfriendly,

19:42.890 --> 19:45.350
but she actually gave hugs
to about everybody there.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.754
I invited her to dinner,

20:13.837 --> 20:16.673
but I was conscious
that I didn't have enough money,

20:16.757 --> 20:19.051
so I told her,
"Well, I could go back to the house

20:19.134 --> 20:21.136
and get a $20 bill out of the dresser."

20:31.897 --> 20:34.066
I kissed her on the neck, went from there,

20:34.733 --> 20:36.860
but something just didn't seem right.

20:38.528 --> 20:41.490
I don't know
if it was clicking for her or not.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.117
She was complaining
she wasn't excited yet.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.703
And, uh, she made a comment,
something like,

20:46.787 --> 20:49.414
"I'm not getting there.
Why don't you get it over with?"

20:51.541 --> 20:52.709
That pissed me off.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.172
I, uh…

20:58.257 --> 20:59.758
tagged her with my right arm.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.761
What do you mean, tagged her?
What does that mean?

21:03.262 --> 21:06.890
I just lost my cool,
and I struck her in the side of the face,

21:06.974 --> 21:10.102
and I never stopped striking her
until she was…

21:20.445 --> 21:22.990
She said things
that my wife used to tell me

21:23.073 --> 21:24.241
when we were having sex,

21:24.324 --> 21:26.827
and-- and it just brought back memories.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.620
I was not…

21:29.788 --> 21:32.708
I don't think
I was all there at that time.

21:52.894 --> 21:56.565
I was thinking of the fingerprints
I left on the-- on the buttons…

21:56.648 --> 22:00.527
-
-…so I took the buttons off her jeans.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.613
- Okay. Uh, what happens next?
-

22:08.285 --> 22:09.703
I take off in the car,

22:09.786 --> 22:12.873
and I go looking for a place
I can go dump her body.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.677
I noticed a bunch of people
parked around the Vista,

22:25.761 --> 22:27.512
maybe three or four cars.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.351
I finally figured
I'd just keep on going down the hill

22:32.434 --> 22:34.102
until I found a place.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.565
At that time,
I was really getting kind of panicky,

22:38.648 --> 22:40.150
and, uh…

22:41.109 --> 22:44.863
I saw a big tree on the right,
and then I stopped in front of it.

22:45.906 --> 22:49.201
I just grabbed her
and dragged her down the hill.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.883
You've talked about a purse?

23:06.760 --> 23:10.514
Yes, I-- I got rid
of her purse the next following morning.

23:25.529 --> 23:28.073
I drove back out of there.

23:30.450 --> 23:33.036
Followed generally the same path
across the river…

23:35.580 --> 23:37.541
and I pulled over to a wide spot.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.835
I took the purse,

23:39.918 --> 23:44.214
and I tossed the contents
and the purse out over the area.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.385
Purse probably went
40 feet down off the bank.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.325
I'm not guilty of murder.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.245
<i>For five years and nine months,</i>

29:07.328 --> 29:11.416
<i>Laverne Pavlinac has been behind bars</i>
<i>for a murder she confessed to.</i>

29:11.499 --> 29:14.294
<i>A murder authorities now agree</i>
<i>she did not commit.</i>

29:26.306 --> 29:28.683
 <i>Prosecutor Jim McIntyre</i>
<i>put the two in prison</i>

29:28.767 --> 29:30.310
<i>and now works to get them out.</i>
