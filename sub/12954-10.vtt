00:01.000 --> 00:01.990
Previously on "Alias":

00:02.068 --> 00:05.003
Marshall counted 1 2 sources
that make up Prophet Five.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.130
They killed Vaughn.

00:08.208 --> 00:12.269
I'm not sure if I can do this, Dad.
It's hard being without him.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.542
You got an active one there.
Just like Mommy.

00:17.017 --> 00:21.181
Then you're suggesting
that we abduct Sydney Bristow.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.415
Prophet Five has Sydney.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

01:03.797 --> 01:05.263
There!

01:35.995 --> 01:42.230
This is field agent lD Black Seven Niner
Three Sierra. Confirmation Foxtrot...

01:51.845 --> 01:54.712
Repeat, confirmation Foxtrot One.
Status MlA.

01:54.781 --> 01:59.616
I'm being held aboard a cargo freighter.
Registry unknown.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.113
Do it.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.094
Organize a deck-by-deck search
and find her.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.801
Dammit.

02:24.010 --> 02:28.071
- What did you find out?
- Prophet Five is holding Sydney.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.582
They've had designs on her
from the beginning.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.346
They knew where and when
she'd be most vulnerable.

02:33.419 --> 02:36.115
- They must have been tracking her.
- Any demands?

02:36.189 --> 02:41.024
None. Whatever their intentions,
for now, I believe they need her alive.

02:41.094 --> 02:45.997
Listen, Sydney's come through some bad
situations. Whatever you need, I'm here.

02:46.065 --> 02:50.434
For now, contact everyone you know,
official or otherwise. I'll do the same.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.870
OK. I'll let you know
if anything comes up.

02:58.077 --> 03:02.480
Mr. Bristow. I just recovered
a field transmission. It's from Sydney.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.710
Where is she?

03:04.784 --> 03:10.745
This is field agent ID Black Seven Niner
Three Sierra. Confirmation Foxtrot...

03:10.823 --> 03:16.784
Repeat. confirmation Foxtrot One.
Status MIA. I'm being held...

03:16.863 --> 03:19.229
- What happened?
- I don't know.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.466
The file's corrupted.
I can't seem to pull 'em up.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.699
It's OK, I just need a second
to triangulate the signal origin.

03:26.773 --> 03:32.302
Then I'll have the exact location
Sydney sent it from. Just...

03:32.378 --> 03:35.677
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You know what? They're being deleted.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.979
This doesn't make sense.
It's like someone wiped out the archive.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.782
What archive?!
Whose system are you logged into?

03:41.854 --> 03:43.685
This must be wrong.

03:49.629 --> 03:53.531
It's our own.
Gather everyone in the briefing room.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.934
No, we haven't located her yet.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.406
No, that won't be necessary.

04:06.145 --> 04:10.275
- Shall we prepare to welcome company?
- The transmission's been taken care of.

04:10.350 --> 04:15.947
- We've cleared the lower deck. Nothing.
- Then why are you still standing here?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.786
(speaks Eastern European language)

04:23.396 --> 04:25.387
(speaks Eastern European language)

04:37.110 --> 04:40.773
Moments ago, we received
a field communication from Sydney.

04:40.847 --> 04:45.045
From the little we were able to decipher, it
appears she's being held by Prophet Five.

04:45.118 --> 04:51.250
However, before we were able to resolve
the transmission, someone deleted it.

04:51.691 --> 04:54.023
Someone at Langley.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.761
Based on current intelligence,
we have reason to believe

04:57.830 --> 05:02.062
that Prophet Five's network has infiltrated
agencies of several foreign governments.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.366
It now appears
they may have infiltrated our own.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.764
Someone within the ClA
did not want us to receive that message.

05:11.110 --> 05:14.273
It's protocol for all incoming signals,
priority three and above

05:14.347 --> 05:17.441
to be automatically backed up
on Echelon's comm archive.

05:17.517 --> 05:21.920
Unfortunately, the only way to gain access
to this archive is on the premises itself.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.752
Not an easy task
given the security measures.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.851
Wait. Are you suggesting
that we break into ClA headquarters?

05:29.562 --> 05:31.496
Yes.

05:31.564 --> 05:36.501
Shouldn't we consider other possibilities?
Maybe it was purged accidentally.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.935
We could ask Langley
for a copy of the archives...

05:39.005 --> 05:43.408
I appreciate your concerns, but we have
no way of knowing how deep this rages.

05:43.476 --> 05:46.673
We can't risk tipping them off
to our agenda.

05:47.714 --> 05:53.152
Effective as of this moment, all information
relating to this task force and its activities

05:53.219 --> 05:57.178
is to be strictly compartmentalized,
even from the ClA itself.

05:59.158 --> 06:02.286
I understand
what I'm asking of all of you.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.854
An action of this kind
could be considered treason.

06:05.932 --> 06:11.564
Given that, if anyone feels they need
a leave of absence, you're free to do so.

06:11.637 --> 06:14.936
No questions asked.
But now is the time to speak up.

06:25.752 --> 06:29.882
All right, then.
We're wheels up in an hour.

06:57.884 --> 07:01.581
I want a visual inspection
of every container on that deck.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.815
Post four, do you copy?

07:03.890 --> 07:06.290
Post four, reporting in.

07:09.128 --> 07:12.894
- You tracked me with the radio.
- Not really. You're just predictable.

07:12.965 --> 07:16.059
A woman in your condition -
shouldn't you be resting?

07:16.135 --> 07:19.434
Thanks.
I don't plan on staying long.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.996
Turn around
and give me your radio.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.302
Whatever.

07:25.545 --> 07:29.276
But you should know that no one's coming
for you. We intercepted your message.

07:29.348 --> 07:32.943
Nice try. My message didn't go through
a relay. It went directly to my people.

07:33.019 --> 07:37.479
That's not true, exactly.
Technically, it went to Langley.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.355
That's where it was intercepted.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.925
You're bluffing.

07:43.996 --> 07:46.590
If you really had
an undercover asset within the ClA,

07:46.666 --> 07:49.362
why would you risk
admitting it to me?

07:49.435 --> 07:52.927
Because you're not
getting off this ship.

07:54.207 --> 07:58.541
Jack, Dixon just called.
They're in position.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.978
We're ready out here.

08:04.784 --> 08:08.447
I'd like to welcome everyone
to the ClA's new headquarters building

08:08.521 --> 08:10.614
here in Langley, Virginia.

08:10.690 --> 08:15.753
Comprising 1.1 million square feet
of space, and resting on 258 acres,

08:15.828 --> 08:20.231
this building was an expansion of
the original structure completed in 1 991.

08:20.299 --> 08:24.702
Aside from the obvious human presence,
there are over 5,000 surveillance cameras

08:24.770 --> 08:26.829
that watch over
every inch of the complex,

08:26.906 --> 08:31.707
and chemical and biological weapons
detection sensors that monitor air quality,

08:31.777 --> 08:34.871
as well as various other
state-of-the-art technologies that,

08:34.947 --> 08:37.438
well, if we told you,
we'd have to kill you.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.542
(laughs)

08:40.086 --> 08:44.182
Now, if you'll follow me, you'll notice
the commemorative plaque off to your right.

08:44.256 --> 08:49.627
It honors the unsung heroes of World War
ll, the intelligence gatherers of the ClA.

08:49.695 --> 08:54.359
- Sidewinder, we're almost ready here.
- (Tom) Roger that. On my way to Payroll.

08:59.672 --> 09:03.267
Hi, I have an appointment
with Human Resources. Emily Higgins.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.641
- All right. Just need an lD.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.546
Sorry. Job interview.
I'm a little nervous.

09:10.616 --> 09:15.553
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
Please place your purse on the table.

09:15.621 --> 09:18.920
Excuse me,
do you know where Payroll is?

09:24.030 --> 09:26.430
We don't allow
camera phones on the premises.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.764
You can pick it up
at the security office on your way out.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.826
OK, thanks.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.435
Third floor,
elevator's to your right.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.499
Thanks.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.683
I'm sorry.
I think there's a problem with my checks.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.696
- Yeah, just a sec.
- Ma'am, I'm actually kind of...

09:58.764 --> 10:01.460
- Name?
- Thomas Grace.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.236
It says you're no longer an employee.

10:06.305 --> 10:10.867
That's why I'm here. I've had several back
checks owed to me. I never receive them.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.037
Our records show that all your checks
went out and were cashed.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.580
That's impossible.

10:15.648 --> 10:19.584
It's usually the spouse that cashes them.
I suggest you check with your wife.

10:19.652 --> 10:25.454
Look, I'm sure if you check your file again,
you'll see that you're mistaken.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.261
Oh. Mr. Grace, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize.

10:32.331 --> 10:35.528
Maybe there's something
I can do here.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.369
We're logging into the server now.

10:47.446 --> 10:50.745
Look, I don't have six months
to wait for the claim to be processed.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.751
- I understand, but...
- I've got a mortgage to pay.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.482
So could you please
just help me out?

10:57.556 --> 10:59.547
(phone whirrs)

11:01.227 --> 11:05.027
Connections established.
Sidewinder, stand by for the access code.

11:05.097 --> 11:08.828
All right, I'll check with my supervisor.
Maybe he can help clear this up.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.892
Thanks.

11:19.045 --> 11:23.345
Access code
is Alpha, seven, Delta, Lima, 22.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.212
Copy that.
I've got access.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.715
Outrigger,
I'm approaching your 20.

11:31.791 --> 11:35.625
Copy.
I'm going to need item number two.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.192
(guide) Here's another
of our display items.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.497
Looks like ordinary pocket change,

11:43.569 --> 11:48.666
but spies used devices like these during
the Cold War to smuggle tiny microfilm.

11:48.741 --> 11:52.905
- You can only imagine what's in use today.
- Hmm.

12:00.319 --> 12:06.189
Oracle, you're clear to the server room.
Call us when you get there.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.656
She's in.
I'm done here.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.098
Copy. Log out and move
to the rendezvous point.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.465
Affirmative.
I'm on my way.

13:21.066 --> 13:24.627
(PA announcement)

13:25.070 --> 13:27.334
I'm at the server room.
Guards are in position.

13:27.406 --> 13:30.739
Copy that. Stand by for the signal.
Merlin, you're up.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.870
Titled Kryptos,
this sculpture was designed in part

13:33.946 --> 13:38.178
as a monument to the code-breakers who
helped crack the German Enigma cipher.

13:38.250 --> 13:42.653
In fact, as you can see, the sculpture is
itself a code, apparently a very good one.

13:42.721 --> 13:46.589
To this day, no one has been able
to decipher the message.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.059
- Now, if we move on...
- I got it.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.295
Sorry, it just came to me.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.864
I play a lot of Sudoku.

13:56.902 --> 14:00.099
Um... Excuse me,
I'll just... if you could...

14:00.172 --> 14:05.166
The letters overlaid under the coding
sections, they act as a key to the cipher.

14:05.244 --> 14:09.578
Based on that,
you just need to transpose the letters.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.481
Right?
That's all you need to do. See?

14:17.389 --> 14:19.482
(alarm blares)

14:19.558 --> 14:22.686
Maybe they found out
I decoded the message. We should run!

14:22.761 --> 14:27.562
- Take it down a notch, Hamlet.
- Everyone, move quickly to the exits.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.534
Anthrax alert.
All report to deck.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.036
I'm in. I need the server number
for Syd's transmission.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.839
We're looking for 8577.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.903
8577. Copy that.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.336
I found it.

15:17.349 --> 15:22.252
- Pulling the archive now.
- Transmission is time-stamped, 9':55am.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.557
The archives have been purged.
It isn't here.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.857
Pull the hard drive.
We may be able to recover data.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.921
OK, hold on a sec.

15:35.501 --> 15:38.026
The hard drive
is patched into the security grid.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.765
- If I remove it, it'll trigger the alarm.
- Pull it.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.706
Langley will initiate a lockdown.
We'll never get them out.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.678
Pull the hard drive now!
I'll get you out.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.574
(alarm blares)

16:02.227 --> 16:03.922
Make the call, Jack.

16:05.297 --> 16:10.234
Excuse me. I'm going to have to ask you
to hold it. We're locking down the facility.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.566
Four in the north corridor.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.039
Sorry, everyone, it appears
we're having a minor security incident.

16:16.108 --> 16:19.805
No one will be able
to leave the building just yet.

16:21.880 --> 16:26.317
A lockdown? 30 seconds ago, I got a call
about an evacuation, an Anthrax attack.

16:26.385 --> 16:31.015
There's a difference. Evacuation means
everyone has to leave, lockdown means...

16:31.090 --> 16:34.184
No, he's in with the delegation.
Besides, what do I tell him?

16:34.259 --> 16:37.626
I got a great idea. Get your facts straight
and then call me back.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.527
Great.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.295
Call State, cancel my four o'clock.
I cannot believe I have to cancel Pilates.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.303
(phone rings)

16:45.371 --> 16:48.863
- Yeah.
- Eric, it's Jack Bristow.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.102
- Jack.
- Sydney's in trouble. I need your help.

16:51.176 --> 16:56.136
What? Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you need.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.494
Outrigger, you copy?
What's going on out there?

17:12.564 --> 17:16.125
The building's locked down.
Are you at the rendezvous point?

17:16.201 --> 17:19.170
I'm stuck
in the witness protection archives.

17:19.238 --> 17:23.196
The door must have sealed
because of the lockdown.

17:23.275 --> 17:26.904
Hold your position.
I'll see what I can do.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.037
OK.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.609
What is it?

17:32.418 --> 17:37.856
Think he's here to arrest us?
He looks like he's coming to arrest us. Hey.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.224
Ambassador Rudland.
How are you, sir?

17:41.293 --> 17:43.727
- And you must be Mr. Gornish?
- Yes.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.357
Oh, it is a pleasure to meet you, sir.
I'm Eric Weiss. I'll be your liaison.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.891
I apologize for the security problems
that we're having today.

17:50.969 --> 17:54.029
Please, it's not a problem.
I understand. These things happen.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.540
And I understand you have a meeting
in 30 minutes.

17:56.608 --> 18:01.671
I'm here to make sure you make that
meeting. I'll escort our visitors from here.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.342
- Jack filled me in. What's going on?
- Tom's trapped in WlTSEC records.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.715
Rachel's still
in the Echelon server facility.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.414
WlTSEC records
is in the northeast corridor.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.424
This should get you through.
Marshall and I can handle Rachel.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.050
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.068
- Tom.
- Thanks.

18:31.143 --> 18:35.273
- What were you doing in here?
- I got detoured. I needed a place to hide.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.508
Come on. We need to move.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.815
OK, got it.
Uh, that's not good.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.190
Where is she?

18:50.028 --> 18:51.859
- There. What's her call sign?
- Oracle.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.364
- Oracle, listen very carefully.
- Who is this?

18:54.433 --> 18:57.561
Right now I'm your superior officer.
Do exactly as I tell you.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.265
There's a guard about to go down
the row you're in. I need you to turn left...

19:01.340 --> 19:03.934
Make a left right now!
Make a left!

19:04.643 --> 19:06.907
Good, good, good.
OK, go straight.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.072
Keep going straight.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.549
- Weiss, look.
- OK, stop right there. Stop!

19:13.752 --> 19:16.152
- How much longer with that door?
- Ten seconds.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.782
When I say go, run as fast as you can
towards the doors at the far end.

19:19.858 --> 19:23.021
Don't stop. We will have those doors open
by the time you get there.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.393
- OK, got it.
- OK, go!

19:27.499 --> 19:30.297
(guard) She's going
to the south entrance!

19:36.208 --> 19:39.541
Uh, sorry, I forgot to hit enter.
OK, now go.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.169
(guard) Stop!

19:45.684 --> 19:47.914
Wow.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.284
- How did it go?
- Not well.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.724
- Hey.
- Don't worry, he's with us.

19:55.794 --> 19:59.992
- Oh, yeah. Eric Weiss.
- Rachel Gibson. Thank you for the help.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.124
- My pleasure.
- Any luck with Syd's message?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.567
They wiped the backups.

20:04.636 --> 20:08.470
We can run data recovery on this,
but if they went to the trouble of deleting it,

20:08.540 --> 20:12.636
I don't think they'd be careless enough
to leave any traces behind.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.647
Better move. Take this tunnel to the end
and you're at the southeast of the complex.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.115
I gotta go
and wipe out the surveillance footage.

20:19.184 --> 20:21.652
- Oh, if you hear anything about Sydney...
- We will.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.417
OK. And one more thing -
next time, just call.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.597
- Care to tell me where we're going?
- Your ship has lifeboats, we're taking one.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.497
Good idea. You'll be spotted
the minute you step on the deck.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.900
Not if you order your men
to search the lower decks.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.903
Do it.

20:44.643 --> 20:45.940
(men approaching)

20:46.011 --> 20:48.002
Get in there. Go.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.485
Make a sound and you're dead.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.853
Something's wrong, isn't it?

21:08.166 --> 21:09.690
Move.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.795
Whatever you say,
but you don't look so good.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.973
Stop.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.991
Come on.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.005
What is this?

21:50.075 --> 21:52.134
Why is this here?

21:52.911 --> 21:58.144
You have until three to start
giving me some answers. One, two...

22:41.259 --> 22:43.921
No, no, no.
You must not move.

22:44.663 --> 22:47.598
- What are you doing to me?
- Just be still.

22:50.268 --> 22:55.331
- The doctor is on the way.
- What doctor? Just tell me what's wrong.

22:57.242 --> 23:01.804
- Is something wrong with my baby?
- I need to tell them you are awake. Be still.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.405
- Wait, please don't go.
- I'll come back soon.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.314
Wait.

23:18.029 --> 23:21.192
You can crack into this hard drive
and find Sydney's transmission?

23:21.266 --> 23:23.325
Cracking the encryption
won't be a problem.

23:23.402 --> 23:28.931
I wrote a program that can handle
anything under 51 2-bit encoding.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.278
(Sydney's voice. muffled)

23:40.452 --> 23:43.285
I can't seem to recover
Sydney's transmission.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.653
Whoever wiped it
used a secure program.

23:45.724 --> 23:48.625
It rewrites random junk
over it hundreds of times.

23:48.693 --> 23:52.026
But the original data's still there,
so it should be retrievable.

23:52.097 --> 23:56.056
If I had an electron microscope
and two weeks, maybe.

23:56.134 --> 23:59.934
I think we found something in the
hard copies of the server box. Check 22.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.269
- An authorization tag.
- I thought so.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.467
This tag has an AB prefix.

24:04.543 --> 24:07.444
That means whoever authorized
the transmission's deletion

24:07.512 --> 24:10.003
had Alpha Black clearance.

24:13.351 --> 24:14.875
What's Alpha Black clearance?

24:14.953 --> 24:18.650
Alpha Black is the highest
clearance level within the ClA.

24:18.723 --> 24:23.126
Prophet Five has ties to the ClA's
operation logs that would give them access

24:23.195 --> 24:27.495
to all classified operations, undercover
agent rosters, our entire infrastructure.

24:27.566 --> 24:31.662
The good news is that whoever deleted
Syd's message had Alpha Black clearance.

24:31.736 --> 24:34.728
That narrows our list of suspects
down to a handful of guys.

24:34.806 --> 24:39.743
Only seven people in the entire agency
have it, all of them Division directors.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.780
The only other thing that
these guys have in common -

24:42.848 --> 24:47.478
they were all assigned a modified version
of the standard STU. A secure cellphone.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.680
- What are you thinking?
- Each phone broadcasts a unique lD.

24:50.755 --> 24:53.349
Now, it took some digging,
but I was able to match

24:53.425 --> 24:57.885
the Alpha Black authorization code
from the server logs to the cellphone lD.

24:57.963 --> 25:00.022
So does that mean
we know who it belongs to?

25:00.098 --> 25:03.829
Not exactly. For security purposes,
Langley doesn't put names to numbers,

25:03.902 --> 25:06.336
but if you can get within 50 feet
of that cellphone,

25:06.404 --> 25:10.773
I might be able to scan it
and see if it matches. We'd have our guy.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.970
We could divide into teams,
put all of them under surveillance.

25:14.045 --> 25:17.708
That could take days. Whatever
Prophet Five has planned for Sydney,

25:17.782 --> 25:20.580
we can assume
we don't have much time.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.347
I have an idea.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.912
- Gentlemen.
- Jack.

25:57.989 --> 26:00.981
It's been a long time.
How's life underground treating you?

26:01.059 --> 26:04.119
Good. Always full of surprises.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.794
I can imagine.
I can't say I miss it.

26:09.334 --> 26:12.394
- Scanner's hot.
- Jack, we've got connection here.

26:12.470 --> 26:18.500
Care to tell us why you called an
operations meeting at eight on a Friday?

26:18.577 --> 26:23.071
I didn't call you all here
for an operations meeting.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.916
Given that all of you have the Alpha Black
clearance, most of you may be aware

26:27.986 --> 26:31.581
that APO has been investigating
an organization known as Prophet Five.

26:31.656 --> 26:34.523
What may, however,
come as news to you,

26:34.593 --> 26:38.051
is we have reason to believe
that someone within our own agency

26:38.129 --> 26:41.360
is in collusion with this organization.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.125
Someone with Alpha Black clearance.

26:44.202 --> 26:48.298
- What have we got so far?
- Four down, three to go.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.136
Still nothing.

26:50.208 --> 26:54.338
The reason I've gathered you all here,
if it isn't obvious by now:

26:54.412 --> 26:58.974
only seven people in the entire agency
have this level of clearance.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.075
And all ofthem aresitting inthis room.

27:01.152 --> 27:05.145
- Oh, come on.
- Jack, this is absurd.

27:05.223 --> 27:09.853
Are you suggesting that one of us
is working for a terrorist organization?

27:09.928 --> 27:13.091
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.192
- I got a match.
- Jack, we've got a signal match.

27:16.267 --> 27:20.601
One of you is working for Prophet Five
and we have your number.

27:21.272 --> 27:22.933
This meeting's over.

27:23.008 --> 27:24.441
Go.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.209
(phone rings)

27:32.550 --> 27:35.781
Jack, what in the hell
are you doing?!

27:35.854 --> 27:37.845
Tell me where Sydney is.

27:38.456 --> 27:41.687
Do yourself a favor.
Stand back.

27:43.762 --> 27:47.630
I'm going to give you one chance.
Where are they holding my daughter?

27:47.699 --> 27:50.793
What the hell?
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.530
Wrong answer.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.603
Stop! For God's sakes, Jack!

27:56.675 --> 27:59.200
(alarm blares)

28:00.245 --> 28:02.440
I've sealed the doors.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.345
Where is she?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.407
You're crazy.

28:06.484 --> 28:08.816
Answerme!

28:10.989 --> 28:14.652
The Athena.
Cargo ship.

28:14.726 --> 28:17.194
Where is the ship?

28:17.262 --> 28:19.730
The North Atlantic.

28:25.970 --> 28:29.428
- Did you get that?
- We got it, Jack. We're on it.

29:51.222 --> 29:55.022
- What is that?
- Something to make you relax.

29:56.694 --> 29:58.355
No.

30:06.237 --> 30:08.865
Can you find the cargo ship
where Sydney is being held?

30:08.940 --> 30:13.240
There are miles and miles of ocean here.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

30:13.311 --> 30:19.272
- What if you patched into the radar sat?
- Overlay it in the optical feed. Genius.

30:20.251 --> 30:23.015
OK, looks like
multiple radar returns.

30:23.087 --> 30:26.147
No, that's commercial shipping.
They're heavily patrolled.

30:26.224 --> 30:29.785
- They won't risk a random inspection.
- Right.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.421
There. That one.
It's in international waters.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.295
A ship that size
wouldn't typically be that far out.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.357
Got it.

30:40.438 --> 30:41.928
- Hello.
- (Sloane) We have a hit.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.635
Marshall is uploading the coordinates
to your GPS. You're clear to go.

30:45.710 --> 30:48.474
Understood.
All right, let's move out!

30:58.857 --> 31:01.018
(woman) What else,
besides abdominal pains?

31:01.092 --> 31:03.583
Dizziness.
Her complexion was pale.

31:03.661 --> 31:06.255
- Any trouble breathing?
- Yes.

31:11.836 --> 31:14.964
- Hello, Sydney.
- You.

31:15.039 --> 31:21.239
I understand you've had some trouble.
Don't worry, we're going to take care of it.

31:22.814 --> 31:26.773
It's good you called me.
Let's take this off her.

31:26.851 --> 31:28.842
You bitch.

31:30.221 --> 31:34.681
- What did you do to me?
- My job is your doctor, nothing more.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.384
I understand
this must be hard to accept,

31:37.462 --> 31:41.990
but it would be much better
if you could just relax now.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.172
Sydney, I'm going to need you
to hold very still.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.841
I have to draw
a sample of amniotic fluid.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.714
You go to hell.

32:00.785 --> 32:04.482
Please, I need you to listen.
This is a delicate procedure.

32:04.555 --> 32:08.685
Any sudden movements
could risk the health of your baby.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.729
- Please don't.
- This might pinch a little.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.170
(whimpers)

32:39.324 --> 32:42.816
Prep the room.
We need to start right away.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.563
Zero-one, what's your status?

32:50.635 --> 32:55.129
We're en route and closing.
ETA, 2300.

32:55.206 --> 32:58.539
You're sure she gave us
the wrong information? What if you...

32:58.609 --> 33:03.273
No, I'm not doubting you.
I just don't see how that's possible.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.374
What do you mean?
How far out?

33:06.451 --> 33:09.909
I'm not sure that gives us
enough time for what...

33:09.988 --> 33:11.512
Of course.

33:11.589 --> 33:12.886
Yes.

33:12.957 --> 33:16.222
I'll let you know as soon as it's done.

33:21.966 --> 33:24.799
Our timetable's changed.
You'll need to work quickly.

33:24.869 --> 33:27.099
- We're just about to start.
- How long?

33:27.171 --> 33:28.968
Aboutan hour.

33:29.040 --> 33:34.774
You've got about 40 minutes.
Let me know the second you're finished.

33:36.314 --> 33:40.648
- Please.
- Just relax. I'm going to take care of you.

34:17.155 --> 34:21.489
- I don't like it. Where are they?
- Probably taken position below deck.

34:21.559 --> 34:26.518
We'll split into teams. You start clearing
from the aft forward, we'll come around.

34:26.597 --> 34:29.565
- Outflank them.
- Let's go!

34:56.726 --> 34:59.127
Where is everybody?

34:59.197 --> 35:01.324
It's all clear.

35:35.199 --> 35:37.360
Bravo, we're all clear here.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.696
They knew we were coming.
The ship's abandoned.

35:40.771 --> 35:42.898
(Tom) Not entirely.

35:42.974 --> 35:47.411
- What do you mean?
- (Tom) Come down to the infirmary.

36:00.057 --> 36:02.457
- Syd, are you all right?
- I can't move.

36:02.527 --> 36:05.462
Get the helicopter ready.
We'll need to medevac her out.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.725
Dixon, is the baby OK?

36:07.798 --> 36:10.289
It's going to be OK, Syd.

36:48.439 --> 36:51.602
(man) I'm sure you're quite pleased
with Sydney's return.

36:51.676 --> 36:54.042
You. however.
made a grave error. Mr. Sloane.

36:54.111 --> 36:58.172
You should have contacted us the second
your agency identified our ship.

36:58.249 --> 37:02.982
If you recall, I tried contacting you earlier
regarding this matter. I was told...

37:03.054 --> 37:07.115
Don't play games with me.
I am aware of your fondness for power.

37:07.191 --> 37:10.649
so I imagine this arrangement
is less than desirable for you.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.128
If you value
your own daughter's life.

37:13.197 --> 37:18.134
from this point on. you are not to take
a single action without clearing it with us.

37:18.202 --> 37:23.504
As far as you're concerned. we own you.
Is that clear enough?

37:23.574 --> 37:27.169
Y eah.
Y es, that is perfectly clear.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.440
You may consider this
a victory right now.

37:29.513 --> 37:34.883
but you should understand
every action has consequences.

37:34.952 --> 37:37.443
We'll be in touch soon.

37:45.062 --> 37:47.155
- Hey, do you have a minute?
- Y eah, sure.

37:47.231 --> 37:49.290
You know that
decryption program I wrote?

37:49.367 --> 37:52.803
Somebody accessed it
when I was out of my office.

37:52.870 --> 37:55.304
We should tell Jack.
With everything that's...

37:55.373 --> 37:57.466
I was able to recover
the decrypted data.

37:57.541 --> 38:02.706
When you were in Langley,
Tom accessed the WlTSEC archives.

38:02.780 --> 38:06.614
- Amanda Grace.
- Yeah. Did you know he was married?

38:06.684 --> 38:08.447
No.

38:11.489 --> 38:14.652
- This is the guy that did it.
- Yeah.

38:14.725 --> 38:17.922
I think that's who
Tom was looking for.

38:39.717 --> 38:41.708
(phone rings)

39:06.277 --> 39:08.006
(in German)

39:08.612 --> 39:10.409
Hallo. Karl.

39:10.948 --> 39:12.848
(in German)

39:17.588 --> 39:19.681
(in German)

39:39.243 --> 39:41.074
Sweetheart.

39:42.747 --> 39:45.648
- I'm sorry it took me so long.
- They just keep running tests.

39:45.716 --> 39:49.709
- But nobody is... They won't tell me.
- I know. They wanted to be sure.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.514
And?

39:56.293 --> 39:59.592
It's OK.
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

40:05.970 --> 40:12.034
It seems there was a crisis with your
pregnancy while you were on that ship.

40:12.109 --> 40:14.942
Sydney, the baby's fine.

40:15.713 --> 40:17.772
It's fine.

40:18.682 --> 40:25.178
What they did to you on the boat - you
were suffering from placental abruption.

40:25.256 --> 40:29.590
They corrected the problem.
They weren't harming the baby.

40:29.660 --> 40:32.128
They were saving its life.

40:34.532 --> 40:37.763
Why?
Why would they do that?

40:37.835 --> 40:40.201
We're not sure.
We don't know what it means,

40:40.271 --> 40:43.331
but I promise you
we'll get to the bottom of it.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.409
Sydney.

40:55.152 --> 40:59.714
While I was on the ship, they tried
to extract information, but I lied to them.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.849
Shh. Not here.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.890
Mr. Bristow.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.760
I'm sorry, sir. That's time.

41:10.334 --> 41:14.168
It's nothing.
Just a small matter I need to tend to.

42:09.093 --> 42:10.651
(children) Bad robot!

42:11.305 --> 42:17.476
