WEBVTT

00:59.293 --> 01:00.626
- Come on, kid.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.799
Man up, dude.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.538
There we go.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.839
Wes?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.107
- Hey, Paul.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.144
- So, the L1 deal is closing

01:19.146 --> 01:21.280
and the partners are flying
into San Francisco.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.148
- Okay.
- I hate to do this to you,

01:23.150 --> 01:27.352
but you're the only one
I trust with this client.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.587
I need you out there.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.355
- Okay.

01:30.357 --> 01:35.094
Look, Wes,
man to man, okay?

01:35.096 --> 01:36.528
Are you gonna
be able to handle this?

01:36.530 --> 01:37.830
- Yes. Why wouldn't I?

01:37.832 --> 01:39.531
I have a good
handle on the account.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.370
We'll be fine, Paul.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.706
We'll be fine.

01:48.876 --> 01:49.975
- Good.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.694
<i>Hi, honey,</i>
<i>make sure to pick up</i>

02:08.696 --> 02:09.795
<i>some cured meats.</i>

02:09.797 --> 02:11.263
<i>And we're low on diapers.</i>

02:11.265 --> 02:13.332
<i>Oh, and I need tampons too.</i>

02:13.334 --> 02:15.267
<i>Go to Whole Foods for</i>
<i>the meats, don't go to Giant.</i>

02:15.269 --> 02:16.802
<i>So, you'll have</i>
<i>to make two stops.</i>

02:16.804 --> 02:18.103
<i>And you know what?</i>

02:18.105 --> 02:20.739
<i>You mind just getting</i>
<i>everything for the week?</i>

02:20.741 --> 02:22.574
<i>I'll text you the list.</i>

02:23.677 --> 02:24.877
<i>Sweetie, sorry,</i>

02:24.879 --> 02:26.044
<i>I forgot to add something</i>
<i>to the list.</i>

02:26.046 --> 02:27.146
<i>Do you mind?</i>
<i>Did you leave already?</i>

02:27.148 --> 02:29.214
- I did, yeah. What is it?

02:29.216 --> 02:30.582
<i>So my father just reminded me</i>

02:30.584 --> 02:32.584
<i>he needs his toilet paper.</i>

02:32.586 --> 02:33.952
<i>Speaking of, they're hungry</i>

02:33.954 --> 02:35.154
<i>and I want to</i>
<i>try to put Lizzie down</i>

02:35.156 --> 02:36.788
<i>before my sister and Andy</i>
<i>show up.</i>

02:36.790 --> 02:38.724
<i>So I'm just gonna serve</i>
<i>everyone.</i>

02:38.726 --> 02:39.858
<i>But I have your plate ready.</i>

02:39.860 --> 02:41.960
<i>I'll keep it covered, okay?</i>

02:41.962 --> 02:43.829
<i>Okay. I'll take care of it.</i>

02:45.232 --> 02:47.399
So, I said,
"I am not going out like that.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.935
You know I'm not going out."
- Wes, oh, my God.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.403
I'm sorry, honey.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.838
We wanted to wait
for you, but we were starving.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.640
- You did remember
the diapers, did you?

02:54.642 --> 02:57.643
- Yeah. Oh, I think
I left them in the car.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.744
- I'll get 'em.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.381
This isn't one-ply, is it?

03:04.084 --> 03:06.752
You got to do something
about that dishwasher.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.487
It just crapped out.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.420
- Hah!

03:45.226 --> 03:46.491
Hmm.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.100
<i>You've reached Luke.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

03:55.102 --> 03:56.268
<i>At the tone,</i>

03:56.270 --> 03:58.003
<i>please record your message.</i>

03:58.005 --> 03:59.438
<i>When you have finished</i>
<i>recording,</i>

03:59.440 --> 04:02.674
<i>you may hang up</i>
<i>or press 1 for more options.</i>

04:03.811 --> 04:08.113
- Hey, man, I don't know why
I've had so much trouble

04:08.115 --> 04:11.883
reaching you for the past month.

04:11.885 --> 04:15.187
Maybe you've been arrested?
Kidnapped?

04:15.189 --> 04:16.221
Maybe you're dead?

04:16.223 --> 04:18.156
I don't really give a fuck.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.926
You should call me back.

04:22.463 --> 04:29.301
But hopefully, you're out there
in that cesspool of silicone,

04:29.303 --> 04:32.037
serving up manhood
in a more efficient manner

04:32.039 --> 04:35.741
than I am here in suburbia,

04:35.743 --> 04:41.613
where I am house dad to
not only my wife and kid

04:41.615 --> 04:44.983
but also my in-laws.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.018
One of whom just told me

04:46.020 --> 04:47.452
I need
to get a bigger fucking house

04:47.454 --> 04:50.522
so that he has more
bathrooms to shit in

04:50.524 --> 04:51.823
and more room
to put his feet up.

04:55.596 --> 04:59.164
Anyway, I won't be mad
about the hiding

04:59.166 --> 05:01.933
if you
show up at this reunion, okay?

05:03.137 --> 05:05.604
I've been drinking. Bye.

05:10.144 --> 05:15.714
¶ Twinkle twinkle little star ¶

05:15.716 --> 05:17.516
Yeah, you're tired.

05:17.518 --> 05:22.487
¶ How I wonder what you are? ¶

05:37.538 --> 05:39.771
<i>It's eczema,</i>
<i>not a skin rash.</i>

05:39.773 --> 05:41.073
Make sure you tell the doctor.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.774
- Fuck, is this
what I think it is?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.609
- His ass? Yeah.

05:44.611 --> 05:48.580
- Great. Thank you, honey.
Can't unsee that.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.614
Oh.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.150
And here's the bill
from last time.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.185
That needs to be paid.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.953
Make sure
they don't overcharge you.

05:57.124 --> 06:00.592
- Goddamn!
A thousand dollars?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.929
To treat skin
on an old man's ass?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.130
- What do you want me to say?

06:05.132 --> 06:08.967
It's my dad.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.169
All right.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.138
- Oh shit. Wes?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.239
- Hmm-mm.

06:14.241 --> 06:17.008
- Look at me.
- Hmm?

06:17.010 --> 06:18.877
- I'm ovulating.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.212
- Okay.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.947
- Take your pants off.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.382
Wait, okay. No--

06:23.384 --> 06:24.816
Does that hurt?
- No, it's--

06:24.818 --> 06:26.718
it-- it's good. It's fine.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.719
- Okay.
- Just go ahead.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.854
- All right.
- Okay.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.188
<i>You reached Luke.</i>

07:03.190 --> 07:04.823
<i>Leave a message.</i>

07:04.825 --> 07:05.924
<i>At the tone,</i>

07:05.926 --> 07:07.492
<i>please record your message.</i>

07:07.494 --> 07:08.927
<i>When you have finished</i>
<i>recording,</i>

07:08.929 --> 07:12.130
<i>you may hang up</i>
<i>or press 1 for more options.</i>

07:13.434 --> 07:15.333
<i>You know, a month ago,</i>

07:15.335 --> 07:18.937
<i>we sat here on the phone</i>
<i>while I bought you</i>

07:18.939 --> 07:20.338
<i>a plane ticket to this reunion.</i>

07:20.340 --> 07:21.907
<i>And you kind of laughed it off</i>
<i>at the time,</i>

07:21.909 --> 07:23.375
<i>but you promised me you'd come.</i>

07:24.478 --> 07:29.247
<i>So, hopefully, you are</i>
<i>coasting comfortably</i>

07:29.249 --> 07:33.552
<i>at 30,000 feet,</i>
<i>on a red-eye right now.</i>

07:35.622 --> 07:37.689
<i>I'm really looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing you, bud.</i>

07:39.259 --> 07:40.826
<i>Could use a talk.</i>

08:13.727 --> 08:15.260
Wes!

08:15.262 --> 08:18.897
- Holy shit! Steve!
How are you, bud?

08:18.899 --> 08:21.366
- How the hell you been, man?
- I'm good. I'm good. You?

08:21.368 --> 08:23.134
- Well. Can't complain.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.270
Still in Philly, workin'.
- Very nice.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.172
- My wife and I
just had a little one.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.974
- Congrats, man.
- Yeah. A baby boy. And--

08:28.976 --> 08:30.075
- That's great.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.877
- Yeah, thanks. It's...

08:33.580 --> 08:35.247
- Yeah.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.481
- How about--
how about you?

08:36.483 --> 08:40.719
I heard you and Sarah Joyce
ended up getting married?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.120
- We did.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.489
- I could've said
that would happen.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.725
You two.
You always had

08:46.727 --> 08:49.494
a Ken and Barbie thing
goin' on.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.831
- Here's your drink, darling.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.299
- Thank you, my dearest.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.700
- Hmm.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.369
Who'd have thought
I could be so thoughtful?

08:57.371 --> 08:58.570
- I know, seriously.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.971
- Hmm.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.323
- What did you do with my wife?

09:01.324 --> 09:02.674
I don't know.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.442
- I'll let you know
if I find her though.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.678
- Thank you so much.
She has my credit cards.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.192
- Is that Maggie Olson?

09:22.696 --> 09:23.929
It is.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.432
Is she comin' over here?

09:27.434 --> 09:28.800
- I wish Luke was here.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.570
How much did you
pay for those tickets?

09:31.572 --> 09:33.405
- This is gonna be interesting.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.406
- Hi, Sarah. Hey, Wes.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.440
- Hey, Maggie.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.808
- Maggie,
you look beautiful.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.209
Thank you.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.579
I-I hear you guys got married.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.647
- We did.
Got married seven years ago.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.049
- Hmm-mm.
- Not that anyone's counting.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.216
- No.
- No.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.184
- He's--
- Feels like yesterday.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.218
Yeah.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.320
- Still that
"angry old man-baby"

09:48.322 --> 09:50.422
that I just tolerate,
so not much has changed.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.459
- What about you?

09:54.461 --> 09:56.728
- No, not married.
Still single.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.096
- Got it.
Where are you now?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.331
- I live up
in Portland, Oregon.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.332
- Oh nice.
- Nice.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.300
- Yeah, I really love it.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.768
- What are you doin' up there?

10:03.770 --> 10:04.903
- I'm a painter.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.838
Which means I spend most
of my time bartending.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.075
- Hey, beats
my concrete jungle.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.244
- Um...

10:16.316 --> 10:18.917
Is Luke here?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.256
- No. H-he didn't make it.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.027
- It's too bad.
Tell him I said hello.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.423
- I'm gonna take
a couple of days off

10:58.425 --> 11:00.091
on either side
of the meeting.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.559
Get out west early.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.262
You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.463
Nothin's gonna
jeopardize the deal.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.798
I just need some time.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.206
- Why don't we try this?

11:15.208 --> 11:18.576
I'll-I'll ramp right before

11:18.578 --> 11:20.512
his first
chorus line on the beat.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.848
And then
we'll intercut that motif

11:23.850 --> 11:25.350
through the rest of the chorus.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.154
Here, watch.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.924
<i>- ¶ Rewind rewind it</i>
<i>Rewind-- ¶</i>

11:32.926 --> 11:33.925
- Oh fuck!

11:33.927 --> 11:36.261
Yes! Yes!

11:36.263 --> 11:38.663
There's it!
The fucking GENIUS.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.266
Right there,
the fucking GENIUS!

11:43.537 --> 11:46.304
You did that in your sleep,
like a fucking Jedi.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.906
Why can't Harold do that?

11:47.908 --> 11:50.341
- Well, you better get
Harold to shape up,

11:50.343 --> 11:51.576
because we
can't afford to keep asking Luke

11:51.578 --> 11:53.712
to save the day
from his apartment.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.247
Speaking of... Luke...

11:56.249 --> 11:58.817
So we are over budget again.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.819
But we can still pay you.

12:00.821 --> 12:04.222
It's just a fraction of the rate
for the hours you've put in.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.356
I'm sorry.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.461
- You know what?
Don't worry about it.

12:09.463 --> 12:13.565
I'll just... consider it
my goodbye present.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.867
- Whatcha talking about?

12:33.186 --> 12:35.020
I'll keep a spot open for you

12:35.021 --> 12:36.855
in case you change your mind
at the last minute.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.857
- Change your mind about what?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.825
Wes?
- Okay. We should go.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.293
Yeah, we're gonna project

12:42.295 --> 12:44.963
all these wacky beams of light
in all different directions.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.398
Like green, purple,
yellow, orange, red--

12:47.400 --> 12:49.200
like a prism, you know?
- Cool.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.618
- Yeah. Sure. Right?

12:50.619 --> 12:52.035
I'm gonna put Beyonce
in a TransAm.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.572
So it'll be like Beyonce,
meets Knight Rider,

12:54.574 --> 12:56.608
meets Dark Side of the Moon.
- Hmm.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.376
- Are you at CAA?
- No.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.712
I-I'll call you.

13:00.714 --> 13:01.813
- Come here, buddy.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.414
- What the fuck
are you doing here, Wes?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.949
- You don't answer
your goddamn phone,

13:04.951 --> 13:07.552
so I'm takin'
matters into my own hands.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.954
It's a nice spot.
About 700 square feet?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.824
- Wes, what the fuck
is goin' on?

13:12.826 --> 13:15.960
She's in Portland.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.328
- What? Who?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.429
- Maggie.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.064
What? Maggie who?

13:20.066 --> 13:21.166
- Your Maggie.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.735
- What? My-my Maggie?
- Yeah. So, guess what?

13:23.737 --> 13:25.236
We're going to Portland!

13:25.238 --> 13:26.271
What?!

13:26.273 --> 13:27.872
- Yeah.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.674
We're gonna drive up to Portland
and we're gonna go see Maggie.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.209
Well, you're gonna
go see Maggie.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.377
And I'm just gonna

13:32.379 --> 13:34.712
stand to the side... happily.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.080
In the bushes or something.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.749
- You're out
of your fucking mind.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.584
She was at the reunion
and she was asking about you.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.386
- She was--
she was asking about me?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.672
- And I'm telling you,
it felt like

13:43.673 --> 13:45.957
the sole reason
she was there was to see you.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.759
And I've got business
up in San Francisco.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.093
We'll kill two birds
with one stone.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.929
And where are you goin'?
- I'm showering.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.597
I'm hungry. Hurry up.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.698
- Calm down.
- Thank you

13:53.700 --> 13:55.166
for getting my luggage.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.037
Very helpful
after a long flight.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.573
You realize how long
of a drive it is to Portland?

14:01.575 --> 14:03.074
- Yeah. It's 570 miles

14:03.076 --> 14:05.376
from Santa Monica Pier
to Leggett.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.611
That's 15 hours of driving.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.946
I figure we cut in
at Lincoln City.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.848
Then from Leggett to Portland,

14:09.850 --> 14:13.318
is 520 miles,
11 hours of driving. So what?

14:13.320 --> 14:16.154
We're talking 1,100 miles,
26 hours of driving.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.726
- Even if we do manage
to get there,

14:21.728 --> 14:23.294
how do we even find her?

14:23.296 --> 14:24.696
- Well, I've done some digging.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.097
She works in this cool place
up at Belmont.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.833
I know where she lives, too.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.471
You're starting to scare me.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.839
- You have wife clearance
for this?

14:34.841 --> 14:37.041
Yeah,
Sarah's totally fine with it.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.209
- Yeah, right.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.080
Speaking of, how is--
how's Lizzie?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.415
- Oh, c'mon.
What else do you have to do?

14:46.419 --> 14:47.886
You can't move home.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.787
What the fuck are you
gonna do in Richmond?!

14:49.789 --> 14:52.824
- Well, my brother
got me a sales job.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.425
- No.
- Waste disposal.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.027
- No.
- Recycling.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.795
- Still no.
Are you kidding me?!

14:58.732 --> 14:59.898
That is not a solution.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.266
I'm not lettin' you do that.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.106
- Shh, you-you reach
a certain age,

15:08.108 --> 15:11.910
and being broke
is just - is a bad look.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.412
It-it gets old
trailing behind everyone else.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.249
- Since when do you care
about everyone else?

15:21.454 --> 15:24.455
Listen,
whenever I get frustrated

15:24.457 --> 15:25.823
with my own life...

15:27.494 --> 15:29.260
I think about you.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.962
I do.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.397
Out here living for us all.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.734
That's just the truth, man.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.036
Can you handle that?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.342
- You can stay at my place
until your meeting.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.311
I'll take you out
here in LA every night.

15:46.313 --> 15:49.314
We'll have a blast,
but I'm not going to Portland.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.618
- Like the first part.
Hate the second part.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.554
We'll go to Portland.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.158
Oh!

16:01.161 --> 16:03.695
I oughta grow out
my beard on this trip.

16:03.697 --> 16:06.764
Nice fuckin' thick beard,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.533
it's what
these LA chicks like, right?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.869
Buy a flannel.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.138
God knows I walk into
someplace with a blazer,

16:14.140 --> 16:16.441
they think
I'm their fuckin' dad.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.575
- Ts-ss.
- But I diss

16:17.577 --> 16:19.677
the blazer and buy a flannel.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.179
Grow out my nice thick beard,

16:21.181 --> 16:23.982
and I'll look just like the
rest of these dirty idiots

16:23.984 --> 16:27.385
with their flannels and beards.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.721
What?

16:29.723 --> 16:31.923
Your little Bukowski shtick

16:31.925 --> 16:33.958
seems to be
workin' out just fine.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.196
C'mon, you've gotten
more ass out here

16:38.198 --> 16:40.498
than you ever did in college
by a multiple of a hundred.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.566
- Yeah. Okay.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.334
Who cares? I'm done.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.037
- What does that mean?

16:46.039 --> 16:48.139
- I'm-- I'm taking a break
from women.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.408
- Uh-- what?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.277
- Look, you won't understand.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.946
- No, I can't say
I would understand.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.081
'Cause absolutely nothing
about a good-looking,

16:57.083 --> 17:00.118
single guy in LA
taking some vow of celibacy,

17:00.120 --> 17:02.020
makes any sense to me,
whatsoever.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.688
- Well, I'm-I'm tired.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.256
- What?

17:05.258 --> 17:07.025
- I haven't had sex
with a girl in six months.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.594
And quite frankly,
I haven't wanted to.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.429
- What is goin' on here?

17:11.431 --> 17:14.098
What have you done
with my friend, Luke, huh?

17:14.100 --> 17:15.299
You don't return your calls.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.535
I buy you a ticket,
you don't fly out.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.438
What's the deal?

17:21.674 --> 17:24.642
- Look, uh... you're not here.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.810
You don't know what it's like.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.913
And-- sorry.
I'm sorry about the ticket.

17:28.915 --> 17:29.981
- No, fuck the ticket!

17:29.983 --> 17:31.082
I just want to know
what's going on?!

17:31.084 --> 17:34.152
- I'm fine.
- Wow. Look at that!

17:38.458 --> 17:39.690
Look at this jewel.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.563
It's pure Cali right there.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.402
Oh, man!

17:52.639 --> 17:55.873
You know,
being here in this moment,

17:55.875 --> 17:58.342
it just makes me
really, really happy

17:58.344 --> 18:00.244
that places
like this still exist.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.214
What?

18:03.216 --> 18:09.787
Hey-hey.
Oh,.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.857
You know
I really liked you. I did.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.625
- Ah.
- And you're just an a-,

18:14.627 --> 18:15.760
he's such an asshole.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.429
Why were you so mean to me?

18:18.431 --> 18:19.697
- I wasn't mean to you.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.866
N-- I-I wasn't mean to her.
- You-- yeah, you were.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.368
I thought you were a nice guy.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.437
But you just
ended up being a jerk.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.271
- Makes a lot of sense.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.673
- He ended up
being a jerk.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.041
- I totally
get that, and I'm sorry.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.009
- Do you just
want to go home? Please?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.211
Alright.
Mallory, we're going home.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.812
- Do you want to go home?
- It's-it's time to go.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.347
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.098
I'm just staying right there.
- Yeah, I'll um-um I'll-I'll-

18:37.099 --> 18:37.848
I'll catch you later.
- Maybe-maybe

18:37.851 --> 18:39.083
I'm gonna be over here.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.118
- Yeah.
- I'm over--

18:40.120 --> 18:41.119
- Catch you later.
- Bye. Okay.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.553
I just-- okay.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.455
- Oh, wow.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.290
Luke, what
did you do to that poor woman?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.092
No, I didn't do anything.

18:50.029 --> 18:53.331
Okay, we were kinda
hookin' up for a while.

18:53.333 --> 19:00.705
And one night, she just starts
crying randomly, for no reason.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.273
I couldn't get it out of her.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.008
She wasn't even drunk.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.078
And then, later
that night, I'm sleeping

19:07.080 --> 19:09.914
and she-she tried to
stick her finger up my ass.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.017
- Oh. That might've
done it for me.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.051
Of course, it would.

19:14.053 --> 19:18.556
S-so now
I'm the asshole and--

19:18.558 --> 19:20.358
me, asshole forever.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.397
- Uh-oh.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.534
Look at this.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.470
Come on,
you can't leave her like that.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.684
Hmm-mm.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.686
Hi.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.887
- Hi.

20:29.329 --> 20:33.731
A-- oh! Ah!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.099
What?

20:35.101 --> 20:37.635
- Oh, your-your breath from
the--

20:37.637 --> 20:39.770
- What?
- The vomit.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.505
- So fuckin' typical
of this city.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.506
- Look, I'm sorry.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.308
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
You're a fuckin' loser.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.677
- Hey, hey, hey,
just take it easy, alright?

20:46.679 --> 20:47.945
I took care of you all night.
- Hey, hey, no.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.113
You're a nobody.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.314
It's no wonder why
you're 30-something

20:50.316 --> 20:52.083
alone in a one-bedroom
guesthouse

20:52.085 --> 20:55.519
with nobody but a fuckin'
douchebag in a fuckin' robe.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.590
You know, I just feel bad
for guys like you

20:59.592 --> 21:01.225
because you'll never
have the capacity

21:01.227 --> 21:04.128
to get your shit together
to bring somebody in.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.196
- You know what? I'll--

21:05.198 --> 21:06.664
I'll consider the source.
Thank you.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.367
- Oh my God, that is
such a fucking cliché!

21:09.369 --> 21:14.372
A 30-something-year-old dreamer
equals a fucking loser!

21:14.374 --> 21:16.440
Loser!

21:16.442 --> 21:18.276
Fuck!

21:18.278 --> 21:20.378
Fuck!

21:30.857 --> 21:31.856
<i>I just think it's time</i>

21:31.858 --> 21:34.859
I settle into
something elsewhere.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.527
- Luke, no.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.896
That blackhole or whatever
that shit was in there,

21:38.898 --> 21:40.197
that's why we got to go
to Portland.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.166
- Oh, will you stop
with the Maggie stuff, please?

21:42.168 --> 21:43.434
- No, Luke, I get it now. I do.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.303
Your career right now, it sucks.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.737
I see that.
You're not happy.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.639
You haven't accomplished
what you want and that sucks.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.141
But you just need
some positive momentum,

21:50.143 --> 21:52.943
and if you get your ass
up that PCH with me--

21:52.945 --> 21:55.279
yes, that's that one step.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.281
That's that one fucking step
in the right direction.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.749
And I promise you,

21:58.751 --> 22:00.785
the momentum's gonna start
to turn in your favor.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.228
- Okay.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.532
- Fuck, yeah.
Pack your shit.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.301
We leave in an hour.
Pack your shit.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.336
- Where-where you're going?

22:18.338 --> 22:20.137
Bring a jacket.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.605
And bring
something nice, please?

23:16.095 --> 23:17.428
- Wait-wait,
where you goin'?

23:19.332 --> 23:21.832
- We're going
on a little college tour.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.000
- Wait, what? Really?

23:23.002 --> 23:25.603
- Why not?
We both look professorial!

23:27.006 --> 23:30.641
Me more than you,
but we'll be fine.

23:49.996 --> 23:53.764
Now tell me,
Luke, you got shit.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.699
I got shit.
We're both in it. But--

23:57.136 --> 23:58.436
You gotta admit, man,

23:58.438 --> 24:00.070
it feels pretty good to
be back around this, huh?

24:02.074 --> 24:04.975
Just look around.
And do this for me.

24:04.977 --> 24:08.112
Close your eyes and sniff.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.382
What do you smell?

24:13.052 --> 24:15.419
- I smell ocean air.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.221
Maybe a little beer.
- Yeah.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.389
- Some dog shit.

24:18.391 --> 24:20.458
- Little bit, yeah.

24:20.460 --> 24:24.528
Now, is that--
is that strawberry lotion?

24:24.530 --> 24:27.798
You've always been a sick fuck.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.667
- What? Man, we're back.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.801
We're here, right?

24:32.071 --> 24:33.137
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.574
Oh, she's lookin' at you.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.677
Did you learn
nothin' last night?

24:39.679 --> 24:42.880
- No, this is different.
More wholesome.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.748
Say somethin'. The first thing
that pops into your head.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.250
Go, go, go!

24:46.252 --> 24:47.485
- Hey.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.621
Umm...

24:50.622 --> 24:52.489
Do you know where we can get
some-some smoothies around here?

24:52.492 --> 24:54.425
Smoothies? Umm...

24:54.427 --> 24:55.559
Yeah.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.761
Yeah, there's a smoothie
place called 'Blenders'

24:57.763 --> 24:58.863
back on Pardall.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.565
- Cool.
- Great. Yeah, thank you.

25:02.935 --> 25:03.968
- Yeah.

25:05.404 --> 25:06.971
- Welcome to I.V.!

25:09.942 --> 25:12.142
- You just asked her
where to get some smoothies?!

25:12.144 --> 25:14.378
- I believe I did.
- Yeah. Odd exchange.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.547
- ¶ I said we're all gonna die ¶

25:16.549 --> 25:18.482
¶ But I'll never believe it ¶

25:18.484 --> 25:22.152
¶ I love this world
And I don't wanna leave it ¶

25:22.154 --> 25:24.255
¶ Said that death is a deal ¶

25:24.257 --> 25:25.589
¶ That you cannot refuse ¶

25:25.591 --> 25:30.461
¶ But I love you girl
And I don't wanna lose you ¶

25:32.231 --> 25:34.632
¶ Don't want a long ride ¶

25:36.302 --> 25:38.602
¶ I don't wanna die at all ¶

25:38.604 --> 25:42.106
¶ I wanna be the man
Who lives forever ¶

25:45.044 --> 25:49.346
¶ I ain't never gonna die
And I want you to come ¶

25:49.348 --> 25:53.183
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

25:53.185 --> 25:57.087
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

25:57.089 --> 26:00.791
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

26:00.793 --> 26:04.662
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

26:04.664 --> 26:08.432
¶ I said life is a tale
It begins and it ends ¶

26:08.434 --> 26:09.900
- Alright.
Pay attention.

26:09.902 --> 26:10.868
You may learn something.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.202
You surfer pansies

26:12.204 --> 26:14.138
need to put a little hair
on your chest.

26:14.140 --> 26:18.342
So we're gonna drink some
aged distilled grain like men.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.643
There we go.

26:19.645 --> 26:23.147
To surfin' dudes with attitudes.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

26:25.585 --> 26:26.584
Okay.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.952
Okay.

26:27.954 --> 26:28.986
Here we go, boss.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.220
- Hey--
- Yeah!

26:30.222 --> 26:31.822
- Come here.
- Alright. One second, yes?

26:31.824 --> 26:34.391
- Oh! Lookie here!
- Oh, my God.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.060
- The smoothie guys.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.127
- You know this crew?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.462
- Oh, not too well,

26:38.464 --> 26:40.531
but it's just how
people do it in I.V.

26:40.533 --> 26:42.066
- Yeah, it's an open-door
policy around here.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.400
You come in, you party.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.337
If you enter,
you gotta live it up.

26:46.339 --> 26:48.105
- Live it up!
I.V. Baby!

26:48.107 --> 26:50.074
- Yhoo!

26:51.344 --> 26:53.043
- A couple
parties down the street

26:53.045 --> 26:54.244
are gonna rage later.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.379
- Yeah?
- Hmm-mm.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.214
- We're in. Let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.616
- This is--
this is just our speed.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.451
- No, no.
This is not just our speed.

27:00.453 --> 27:01.885
- We need more speed.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.488
Okay.

27:04.490 --> 27:05.456
- You guys are funny.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.825
What's your story?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.060
- On a road trip. Headin'
up Highway 1 to Portland.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.763
- Ah, that's sweeeeet.
Portland's so chill.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.365
- Wait?
If you're going to Portland,

27:14.367 --> 27:16.433
you going up the Coast
through Big Sur?

27:16.435 --> 27:18.769
- You bet your sweet little
ass we are!

27:18.771 --> 27:21.171
I-is not what I meant to say.
Yes, we are.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.673
I'm not a sexist pig.
I promise.

27:22.675 --> 27:26.010
I just noticed earlier
that you are-- um, have a-a--

27:26.012 --> 27:27.911
yeah-yeah, things
are going well in that area.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.880
Yeah. She does have a cute
little bubble butt, doesn't she?

27:29.882 --> 27:31.281
She does.

27:32.551 --> 27:33.484
- Well, we're trying to meet
some friends up there,

27:33.486 --> 27:34.918
but we need a ride.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.755
- Is that so?

27:37.757 --> 27:39.790
Alright, well hey, you show us
some fun tonight,

27:39.792 --> 27:41.492
we'll get you
where you need to go.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.994
- Us?! Fun?!
Oh, that's--

27:43.996 --> 27:45.396
- It's not
gonna b- No? Roblem.

27:45.398 --> 27:46.463
- Hmm-mm.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.065
- We bring all the fun.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.603
Phh.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.341
- Ah-oh, whoa.

28:32.845 --> 28:35.946
No thanks.
Never touched the stuff.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.281
- Wow, never?

28:37.283 --> 28:38.849
I don't do mellow.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.951
I'm a grown man, I drink scotch.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.454
- Bullshit,
that's not the reason.

28:43.456 --> 28:44.888
- What?

28:44.890 --> 28:46.757
- It's because when he used to
smoke back in college,

28:46.759 --> 28:49.159
he'd turn into
this paranoid mess.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.928
- No. That is not true.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.596
I once had to cradle him.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.231
He thought he was an orange.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.733
And he-he was afraid he was

28:55.735 --> 28:57.668
gonna get peeled.

28:57.670 --> 29:00.337
- That-- the orange incident
did happen.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.705
- Well, you'll just have to fare

29:01.707 --> 29:03.707
with the
boxed wine in the fridge.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.609
- Of course,
you have boxed wine,

29:05.611 --> 29:08.178
because you're a classy lady.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.713
Yes. Thank you.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.049
Excuse me.

29:20.793 --> 29:23.327
- You know, you
don't have to be afraid of me.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.828
I don't bite.

29:29.034 --> 29:30.567
- Sold.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.002
Hmm.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.343
- I'm gonna
smoke a little ganja.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.914
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Hmm-mm.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.084
- Oh, it says
refreshing on the box.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.153
This is exciting.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.759
Very cool, Snoop.

29:55.761 --> 29:56.960
- You should take a rip!

29:56.962 --> 29:58.629
And just go be paranoid
in the corner.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.598
- Yeah, what's your deal, Wes?

30:01.600 --> 30:05.235
You look like
a very slick banker guy.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.137
Are you from New York?

30:07.139 --> 30:09.239
- Close. D.C. area.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.641
- Hmm.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.509
I bet your closet's
full of Brooks Brothers.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.978
- No. No. No, no, no.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.848
Brooks Brothers
is entry level shit.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.516
Most of my shirts
are from Geneva.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.517
Oh.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.752
- Just the supple cotton

30:21.754 --> 30:24.021
is better for my chest hairs.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.923
All four of them?

30:25.925 --> 30:28.292
- Wes makes a lot of money
in venture capital.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.961
- Nah, I make a lot of money
being super boring.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.964
- And what do you do?
Work at Smoothie King?

30:33.966 --> 30:35.399
- A, well um--

30:35.401 --> 30:37.167
- Luke edits music videos in LA.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.268
- Oh, wow! That's so cool!
- Yeah.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.403
- Yeah. So cool.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.305
- He is not super boring!

30:41.307 --> 30:42.606
Well, you know,

30:42.608 --> 30:44.708
my mom always says
that you can't make a "life"

30:44.710 --> 30:46.844
unless you do
what makes you happy.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.178
- God bless your mother.

30:49.882 --> 30:53.584
I'm guessing she's
a super-hot yogi milf.

30:53.586 --> 30:55.619
She sure is!

30:55.621 --> 30:57.387
I knew I was right.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.323
So what's in Portland?

31:06.265 --> 31:07.731
- Good question, Constance.

31:07.733 --> 31:08.966
I'll answer it.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.970
I happen to have run into
one of Luke's college pals

31:12.972 --> 31:17.474
and she inspired
this little journey

31:17.476 --> 31:18.575
up the coast.
- Oh.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.444
- There's a girl up in Portland,

31:20.446 --> 31:22.813
and you guys
are going to see her?

31:22.815 --> 31:24.748
Was it an old
college girlfriend?

31:24.750 --> 31:25.782
- It's a love quest.
- Hmm-mm.

31:25.784 --> 31:26.750
- No, it's not a love quest.

31:26.752 --> 31:27.851
- It's a love quest.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.286
- It's a fuckin' love quest.
It is.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.688
- Yeah, I highly doubt that.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.490
- Yeah, don't pay
too much attention.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.160
This guy over here is probably
already in love with you.

31:37.162 --> 31:39.763
And fun fact, he's gonna
kill me for saying this,

31:39.765 --> 31:42.266
but Luke here has
the largest collection

31:42.268 --> 31:45.836
of romantic films
this si ssippi.

31:45.838 --> 31:48.272
I caught him
on multiple occasions

31:48.274 --> 31:50.073
jerking off
to <i>Notting Hill</i> in college.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.576
You--
- Hugh Grant's sexy.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.627
- You can't--
you can't unsee that.

31:53.628 --> 31:54.677
Well, that is adorable.

31:54.680 --> 31:58.582
So VHS or laserdisc?

31:58.584 --> 31:59.583
- It's a poster.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.989
Oh. Okay.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.360
- You two have fun.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.361
- You two have fun.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.064
Not too much "fun".

32:18.604 --> 32:19.836
- Hmm.

32:20.906 --> 32:27.644
So,
did I do my job this evening?

32:27.646 --> 32:29.446
- Yes, you did.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.214
You have earned your free ride.

32:31.216 --> 32:32.349
Yes.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.262
- Ah.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.065
- Come on.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.368
- What?
- Dance with me.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.303
Oh. More dancing.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.938
- Hmm.
- Wonderful.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.315
- Tell me something about you?

33:07.086 --> 33:10.253
That only some random
college girl would know.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.826
Tell me a secret.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.494
Make it ours.

33:23.936 --> 33:27.537
Well,
believe it or not,

33:29.775 --> 33:34.044
this is one of the happier days
I've had in a very long time.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.078
- Hmm.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.582
This day isn't even over yet.

33:41.420 --> 33:42.486
Hmm.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.884
- Hello?

34:13.886 --> 34:15.719
- Hey honey, it's me.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.287
<i>Wes?</i>

34:17.289 --> 34:18.622
What time is it?

34:18.624 --> 34:23.093
- Well, almost six your time.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.762
- Hmm. Is everything okay?

34:25.764 --> 34:27.397
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

34:27.399 --> 34:29.466
Everything's fine.

34:29.468 --> 34:30.434
Just couldn't sleep.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.036
How's Lizzie?

34:33.038 --> 34:34.771
<i>Hmm. She's good.</i>

34:34.773 --> 34:36.206
She misses her Daddy.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.776
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:39.778 --> 34:41.078
I miss her too.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.684
Alright. Go back to bed.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.685
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

34:49.855 --> 34:51.455
- Hmm. I love you.

34:52.691 --> 34:53.690
- I love you too.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.544
Hmm.

35:31.396 --> 35:34.131
- So, Wes, I heard
you're married?

35:34.133 --> 35:36.466
Might explain why I didn't
get any last night, huh, buddy?

35:38.137 --> 35:40.737
Oh, and you have a kid.
That's so cute!

35:40.739 --> 35:42.439
She is.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.207
Would be very proud of me
right now.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.818
- ¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

35:56.755 --> 35:59.222
- ¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

36:00.592 --> 36:04.261
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

36:04.263 --> 36:08.632
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

36:08.634 --> 36:11.668
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

36:12.771 --> 36:15.205
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

36:17.209 --> 36:21.077
¶ Something that I can't hide ¶

36:21.079 --> 36:24.915
¶ Put your hands in the sky ¶

36:24.917 --> 36:29.186
¶ Love will make you feel high ¶

36:29.188 --> 36:37.260
¶ Love will make you
Feel alive ¶

36:38.897 --> 36:41.431
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

36:42.935 --> 36:46.303
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

37:08.293 --> 37:09.826
- I literally have chills
right now.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.428
- I told you. It's magical.

37:15.601 --> 37:19.402
- I just want to look at this
and remember it.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.245
Okay. We're good.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.915
Mental snapshot
in my brain forever.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.252
<i>And what's it like</i>

37:35.254 --> 37:38.521
<i>being married to someone</i>
<i>you met when you were 19?</i>

37:38.523 --> 37:41.491
It feels kind of
old fashioned these days.

37:43.195 --> 37:45.762
- That's me.
Just an old 60's Chevy.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.666
- The-the Bronco
suits you better.

37:55.474 --> 37:58.241
- When you're young,
your heart is so big.

38:01.046 --> 38:05.782
It's just racing to let in
every opportunity...

38:08.120 --> 38:09.519
every feeling.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.520
Everything.

38:14.326 --> 38:15.558
But--

38:16.595 --> 38:18.662
you don't really know
who you are at 19.

38:31.977 --> 38:32.942
<i>I mean, don't you love</i>

38:32.944 --> 38:33.910
<i>getting to be creative all day?</i>

38:35.280 --> 38:37.914
Plus, why go
and leave all this behind?

38:45.057 --> 38:47.290
- Well, what?
Should I come live with you?

38:49.494 --> 38:50.527
- You'd do that?

38:51.763 --> 38:52.762
- Sure. Why not?

38:53.965 --> 38:55.832
I can totally see myself
with you.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.400
- Oh yeah?

38:57.402 --> 38:59.736
So, you'd just dive in with
some "enchanting" college girl

38:59.738 --> 39:01.271
you met like 12 hours ago?

39:03.041 --> 39:04.541
- You. Me. Here.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.913
I can paint any beautiful
delusion for our future.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.920
- See?

39:16.922 --> 39:17.987
You really are romantic.

40:01.466 --> 40:04.134
¶ This life of ¶

40:04.136 --> 40:07.704
¶ Darlin' darlin' darling
You're my song ¶

40:07.706 --> 40:09.239
Whoah!

40:09.241 --> 40:11.574
- ¶ Darling you're my song ¶

40:14.613 --> 40:15.845
- Hmm.

40:15.847 --> 40:16.980
- What the fuck?

40:18.283 --> 40:20.250
- Hmm.
What's goin' on, baby?

40:20.252 --> 40:24.053
- Hey guys,
this is Charlie and Sev.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.923
- Hello.
- Charlie.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.691
What's up, brothers?

40:28.693 --> 40:30.593
Thanks for giving
the goddesses a ride.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.797
- Sure. Yeah.

40:33.799 --> 40:34.998
- Beats an Uber.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.334
- Yeah.

40:38.336 --> 40:39.903
You guys should come with us.

40:39.905 --> 40:43.773
We're going to grill some fresh
Ahi, smoke some green grasses.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.741
Gonna camp out.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.009
Join us.

40:47.612 --> 40:51.514
- Yeah. No.
Ah, thank you, though.

40:51.516 --> 40:54.250
- Yeah, we'll take
a raincheck on the tuna.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.985
Gotta get goin'.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.254
- Okay.
Chill! Well, safe journey.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.890
Very great to meet you bros.
Prosper.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.292
- Likewise.

41:02.294 --> 41:04.060
- And if you brothers
change your mind, you know,

41:04.062 --> 41:07.197
we got extra tents
and good vibes.

41:07.199 --> 41:10.366
Ganja, goddesses.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.268
I don't think we will.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.637
- Yeah. Unlikely,
but thank you for the uh--

41:14.639 --> 41:16.773
for the offer.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.042
- Nice to meet you, dudes.

41:19.044 --> 41:22.178
- Hmm-mm. Absolutely.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.179
Yeah.
- Thank you.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.747
Pleasure.

41:30.422 --> 41:32.388
What?

41:35.760 --> 41:38.194
- Ah, I don't know.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.796
Don't you think a little
heads-up

41:39.798 --> 41:41.598
would have been in order?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.466
- No. Why?

41:43.468 --> 41:45.001
I'm not his property.

41:47.372 --> 41:50.607
I'm no one's and everyone's.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.742
Through me.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.512
- That doesn't mean anything.

41:56.615 --> 41:59.649
- I just listen to my energy
and I follow it, Luke.

42:09.261 --> 42:10.727
Don't do anything else.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.530
Do you.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.766
- I'll keep that in mind.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.079
- Well...

42:31.216 --> 42:32.749
Hmm.

42:32.751 --> 42:34.417
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

42:34.419 --> 42:37.720
I hope you find more
happy days,

42:39.357 --> 42:41.891
old fashioned.

42:43.361 --> 42:44.761
- Thank you.

42:46.731 --> 42:47.897
- Go get her.

42:59.411 --> 43:01.811
- Okay. Can we just
acknowledge something

43:01.813 --> 43:03.246
for a second?

43:03.248 --> 43:04.280
That was a great moment.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.348
Whether or not
they're down there

43:05.350 --> 43:09.953
with Johnny Dipshit
and the German sociopath.

43:12.223 --> 43:14.624
You had fun,
I can see it on your face.

43:14.626 --> 43:16.693
- I guess
I just thought we were

43:16.695 --> 43:18.728
destined to run off
into the sunset or something.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.731
Until Bodhi
from <i>Point Break</i> showed up.

43:24.402 --> 43:27.737
- Ah, well, whatever.
We had fun.

43:27.739 --> 43:29.739
- Yeah. Yeah.
I guess. Yeah.

43:31.610 --> 43:33.710
- Ah, nothing should
surprise me anymore.

43:34.779 --> 43:35.912
- Well...

43:37.515 --> 43:38.881
I feel renewed.

43:40.085 --> 43:41.551
- Do ya?

43:42.487 --> 43:43.886
You look renewed.

43:43.888 --> 43:46.956
- I invite you to join me
on this side of a good mood.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.524
- Give me a minute,
I'll be right there.

43:48.526 --> 43:53.129
How many necklaces
does that guy have on?

44:16.921 --> 44:18.921
Hey.

44:18.923 --> 44:20.723
Hey.

44:20.725 --> 44:22.358
- Get up.
- What?

44:22.360 --> 44:24.327
Got us a tee time.

44:24.329 --> 44:25.962
Spanish Bay, baby.

44:29.234 --> 44:30.633
- I hate golf.

44:31.770 --> 44:34.470
- No, you don't.
Come on. Get up.

44:34.472 --> 44:35.538
- I fuckin' suck at it.

44:35.540 --> 44:36.639
- That's fine.
I'll beat you.

44:36.641 --> 44:37.874
Be good for my ego.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.210
Get up.

44:59.931 --> 45:01.831
<i>Luke, it's your brother, Phil.</i>

45:01.833 --> 45:03.332
<i>Give me a buzz</i>
<i>when you get a chance</i>

45:03.334 --> 45:05.401
<i>to chat about the job</i>
<i>we talked about.</i>

45:05.403 --> 45:07.637
<i>Good news is,</i>
<i>if you don't screw it up,</i>

45:07.639 --> 45:09.172
<i>they'll probably</i>
<i>hire you on the spot.</i>

45:09.174 --> 45:12.308
<i>Bad news is, the meeting</i>
<i>is now Monday morning.</i>

45:12.310 --> 45:14.444
<i>I know it's last minute,</i>
<i>but you gotta figure out a way</i>

45:14.446 --> 45:16.145
<i>to get on an airplane</i>
<i>and get out here.</i>

45:16.147 --> 45:17.914
<i>Whatever the damage is,</i>
<i>we'll figure it out</i>

45:17.916 --> 45:19.882
<i>between Dad and I</i>
<i>when you get back.</i>

45:19.884 --> 45:21.818
<i>Alright, man, give me a call</i>
<i>when you get a chance.</i>

45:24.589 --> 45:25.855
- Who was that?

45:27.559 --> 45:29.025
You really got to leave Monday?

45:30.128 --> 45:32.695
For what? For the chance
to go sell trash in Richmond?

45:33.665 --> 45:35.798
- I just-- I got to do this.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.500
- You're meant
to go to Portland.

45:47.145 --> 45:50.146
- Alright. You sink that putt,
I'll stay.

45:53.017 --> 45:55.218
- Game on.

46:12.403 --> 46:16.572
- Well... that's it, I guess.

46:23.681 --> 46:25.982
<i>What's wrong?</i>

46:25.984 --> 46:27.950
<i>What do you mean?</i>

46:27.952 --> 46:29.519
<i>I can tell</i>
<i>by the tone of your voice</i>

46:29.521 --> 46:31.220
<i>something's wrong.</i>
<i>What's wrong?</i>

46:33.558 --> 46:35.391
<i>There's this guy</i>
<i>I'm working with.</i>

46:35.393 --> 46:36.926
<i>Can't really talk specifics,</i>

46:36.928 --> 46:41.097
<i>but I think he's makin'</i>
<i>a big mistake.</i>

46:41.099 --> 46:42.765
<i>Can you get him</i>
<i>to change his mind?</i>

46:44.068 --> 46:46.035
<i>I'm tryin',</i>
<i>but he's a stubborn one.</i>

46:47.539 --> 46:48.538
<i>Well, you've been known</i>

46:48.540 --> 46:50.807
<i>to have the power</i>
<i>of persuasion.</i>

46:50.809 --> 46:54.143
<i>Yeah, well, we'll see.</i>

46:54.145 --> 46:55.411
<i>I got to get goin'.</i>

46:55.413 --> 46:58.347
<i>Kiss Lizzie for me,</i>
<i>and I love you.</i>

46:58.349 --> 46:59.949
<i>Love you.</i>

46:59.951 --> 47:01.317
<i>Bye.</i>

47:11.196 --> 47:12.528
You really would have stayed

47:12.530 --> 47:13.963
if I'd made that putt?

47:15.767 --> 47:16.799
- You'll never know.

47:16.801 --> 47:18.568
Oh, God.

47:21.573 --> 47:23.739
- You know what
this night needs, Luke?

47:25.376 --> 47:26.843
More company.

47:28.146 --> 47:30.246
- Oh, come on, Wes.
It's our last night.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.014
Let's just hang together.

47:33.151 --> 47:34.584
- No.

47:34.586 --> 47:36.719
Ladies, how's the wine?

47:36.721 --> 47:39.021
- Not bad.
- Can't complain.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.557
- Yeah? You-you visiting
from out of town?

47:41.559 --> 47:43.025
- No, I live here in Carmel.

47:43.027 --> 47:45.428
She's in town
visiting from Berkeley.

47:45.430 --> 47:47.597
- Cool. I'm Wes.

47:47.599 --> 47:48.931
- Rebecca.
- Ellen.

47:48.933 --> 47:50.867
- Very good to meet you.
I don't mean to be a creep,

47:50.869 --> 47:53.035
but do you see this scruffy guy,
over here?

47:53.037 --> 47:54.036
Hmm-mm.

47:54.038 --> 47:55.905
This guy
is a dear friend of mine,

47:55.907 --> 47:58.674
and a troubled-- a troubled man,
and um, here's the deal.

47:58.676 --> 47:59.742
Here's what I think
we should do.

47:59.744 --> 48:02.078
The four of us
should go to dinner.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.047
Some good food,
some adult conversations.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.183
A couple of drinks,
maybe several drinks.

48:07.185 --> 48:10.486
Just take some time to remind
ourselves of life's joys

48:10.488 --> 48:14.223
and in so doing, we can help
this poor Sad Sack over here

48:14.225 --> 48:16.492
realize that he's making
the biggest mistake

48:16.494 --> 48:18.094
of his entire life.

48:20.431 --> 48:22.131
Please?

48:22.133 --> 48:23.165
He's a grouch.
- Well, maybe

48:23.167 --> 48:24.967
he's not as hopeless
as you say he is.

48:24.969 --> 48:27.169
Maybe he's just searching
for something more.

48:27.171 --> 48:29.772
- Maybe he hasn't found the one?
Maybe she's in Portland?

48:29.774 --> 48:30.840
- Hmm.
- There we go.

48:30.842 --> 48:33.376
- What does that even mean?
The one?

48:33.378 --> 48:35.711
No, at-at this point in life,

48:35.713 --> 48:38.648
I think it's more
a matter of practicality.

48:38.650 --> 48:41.217
I've given up
on this notion that somehow,

48:41.219 --> 48:44.387
I'll just run into someone
and know that she's the one.

48:44.389 --> 48:46.822
And that's-- that's fine.
It's totally fine with me.

48:46.824 --> 48:48.391
- Seems a little defeatist
to me.

48:48.393 --> 48:50.026
- Agree.
- No, it's--

48:50.028 --> 48:52.361
it's just not worth it anymore.

48:52.363 --> 48:54.263
It's not.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.632
- Dating to eventually
find the right one,

48:56.634 --> 48:58.768
how is that not worth it?

49:01.072 --> 49:07.610
- Okay, so take Ellen and I,
for example.

49:07.612 --> 49:12.081
We could totally go back
to some hotel room

49:12.083 --> 49:15.084
and um, sleep together.
- Hmm.

49:15.086 --> 49:16.552
- Hmm.
- Mm.

49:16.554 --> 49:18.821
But come morning,
either of us could wake up

49:18.823 --> 49:22.224
feeling nothin' but--
but total emptiness.

49:22.226 --> 49:24.427
And just really wanting to find
the quickest way out the door.

49:24.429 --> 49:27.596
All for what?
A couple of hours of pleasure?

49:27.598 --> 49:30.099
- Or we could end up dating.

49:30.101 --> 49:33.302
And then, after a few months--

49:33.304 --> 49:36.505
good months, where our feet
never touch the floor--

49:37.742 --> 49:40.676
Maybe we don't want to invest
in this, you know?

49:40.678 --> 49:42.511
How much do we want to
invest in this thing--

49:42.513 --> 49:43.846
- Yeah.
- --That's taken time away

49:43.848 --> 49:45.915
from meeting someone else?

49:45.917 --> 49:48.851
Maybe I decide
that I wanna move on.

49:48.853 --> 49:50.886
- Well--
- Only to realize of course

49:50.888 --> 49:55.291
that, "Oh no,
that was really great."

49:55.293 --> 49:58.027
- Or maybe I'm the one
agonizing--

49:58.029 --> 49:59.395
--over my exit strategy

49:59.397 --> 50:01.931
because I'm-- I'm somehow
riddled with all this guilt

50:01.933 --> 50:06.002
over telling you that,
"I'm really sorry,

50:06.004 --> 50:08.604
but this isn't
gonna happen after all."

50:08.606 --> 50:12.108
- Oh!
So I'm left there wondering--

50:12.110 --> 50:14.677
--did I mismanage my emotions

50:14.679 --> 50:16.412
when I was with you?

50:16.414 --> 50:17.480
If I had done this
or that differently--

50:17.482 --> 50:19.181
- Agh!

50:19.183 --> 50:20.716
Yes.
- --Would you have left me?!

50:20.718 --> 50:22.852
- The pining
is the fucking worst!

50:22.854 --> 50:25.488
It's true.

50:25.490 --> 50:27.356
- It's pretty fucking awful.

50:27.358 --> 50:28.357
- Yeah.

50:29.894 --> 50:34.330
So why not just stick yourself
in a foxhole

50:34.332 --> 50:35.831
with someone
we're comfortable with,

50:35.833 --> 50:39.235
who cares for you,
fulfills all your daily needs--

50:39.237 --> 50:40.169
- Hmm.

50:40.171 --> 50:41.871
- --Even though
you're not entirely sure

50:41.873 --> 50:43.472
that they're the one.

50:49.047 --> 50:50.046
- Wow.

50:51.049 --> 50:52.848
You two are clearly
meant to be together.

50:54.185 --> 50:56.118
Best of luck to both of you--

50:56.120 --> 50:57.887
- Thank you.
- --On that tragic journey.

50:59.123 --> 51:01.323
Rebecca, how about you?

51:01.325 --> 51:02.792
- Ha. Uh...

51:02.794 --> 51:06.495
Well... it's complicated.

51:06.497 --> 51:09.131
- Oh! Sure.

51:09.133 --> 51:11.133
It's all complicated, right?

51:15.773 --> 51:19.175
- To be honest... um...

51:19.177 --> 51:22.378
This mornin',
I signed my divorce papers.

51:29.053 --> 51:30.419
- Sorry to hear that.

51:31.923 --> 51:33.189
- It's okay.

51:36.227 --> 51:37.226
Actually...

51:39.197 --> 51:42.398
it feels good to say it.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.366
Yeah.

51:44.368 --> 51:45.901
I'm divorced.

51:48.739 --> 51:49.705
- There you go.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.574
- Hmm.

51:51.576 --> 51:53.676
- It's why I came down.

51:53.678 --> 51:54.844
Just to give her some support

51:54.846 --> 51:57.513
when she officially
closed the chapter.

51:59.150 --> 52:01.150
Look at the sunset,
have a drink.

52:01.152 --> 52:03.018
Think about a new chapter.

52:04.222 --> 52:06.288
Come on.
To a new beginning.

52:15.833 --> 52:17.166
- What about you, Wes?

52:18.503 --> 52:20.202
- Uhm.

52:20.204 --> 52:21.303
Well...

52:22.373 --> 52:23.639
I'm married.

52:23.641 --> 52:24.707
- Hmm.

52:24.709 --> 52:26.475
- We have a baby girl.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.577
She's-- actually,
she's almost two now.

52:30.148 --> 52:31.680
- How long
have you been married?

52:31.682 --> 52:33.349
- Uh, going on seven years.

52:34.485 --> 52:37.653
Though, most days,
it feels like a little longer.

52:39.757 --> 52:43.225
So, I hear ya.

52:43.227 --> 52:46.362
Sharing your life
is complicated.

52:47.632 --> 52:49.165
- Hmm.

52:54.572 --> 52:55.971
- Let's get some air.

52:55.973 --> 52:58.207
- Yeah.
- A little walk around Carmel?

52:58.209 --> 52:59.341
- Did I bring us down that much?

52:59.343 --> 53:00.342
A little bit. Yeah.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.144
- Where are you guys staying?

53:02.146 --> 53:04.313
- We don't have a hotel yet.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.382
- Oh well, then
you're staying with her.

53:07.652 --> 53:08.951
- Oh, no. We'll find a place.
- Yeah, come on.

53:08.953 --> 53:10.052
No, stay with us.

53:10.054 --> 53:11.754
She's got a full bar.
Wine for days.

53:11.756 --> 53:12.955
You gotta help this divorcee

53:12.957 --> 53:14.123
who doesn't wanna
go to sleep yet.

53:14.125 --> 53:15.591
- We're grown men,
we can handle ourselves.

53:15.593 --> 53:16.592
- Ah-uh. You're staying.

53:16.594 --> 53:20.262
- No, the two of you
should stay with us.

53:20.264 --> 53:22.364
It's a-- it's fine.
Plenty of room.

53:24.168 --> 53:25.534
Were you ever married?

53:26.771 --> 53:30.072
- No. Almost. But no.

53:30.074 --> 53:33.108
Almost?
What happened?

53:33.110 --> 53:35.277
- He wanted kids.

53:35.279 --> 53:37.479
- Wait? And you didn't?

53:37.481 --> 53:38.547
- No.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.615
- Wow.

53:41.319 --> 53:43.485
- I'm sorry, are we in 1952?

53:43.487 --> 53:44.920
And I need to put on--

53:44.922 --> 53:46.922
- my little apron and do some
vacuuming around the house?

53:46.924 --> 53:49.191
- I'm-I'm sorry.
I guess I just--

53:49.193 --> 53:51.026
I guess I just have
this idea that deep down,

53:51.028 --> 53:54.630
every woman wants to be a mother
and raise a family.

53:54.632 --> 53:56.632
- No. Not me.

53:57.935 --> 54:00.436
- How old are your kids?

54:00.438 --> 54:03.138
- Jesse's 11,
and Caroline is nine.

54:09.013 --> 54:11.080
- How often
do they see their dad?

54:12.717 --> 54:14.149
- Every other weekend.

54:14.151 --> 54:15.818
We share custody.

54:15.820 --> 54:17.353
He's up in Palo Alto.

54:20.891 --> 54:22.191
- How's that been?

54:23.694 --> 54:27.062
- Um, you can't prepare
for this kind of stuff.

54:28.232 --> 54:31.900
- Did I trade getting married
for living a life of my own?

54:31.902 --> 54:33.269
Sure.

54:35.006 --> 54:37.640
But... you know,
he's married now.

54:37.642 --> 54:39.174
He has his kids.

54:40.711 --> 54:43.178
I don't regret my path at all.

54:45.349 --> 54:47.049
Definitely not boring,
I'll tell you that.

54:48.352 --> 54:49.685
That's kind of the point.

54:51.722 --> 54:53.055
Isn't it?

54:56.294 --> 54:58.994
- All right,
big question for Luke.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.030
Tell me about this Maggie.

55:01.032 --> 55:03.132
What makes her so special?

55:03.134 --> 55:04.600
- The thing about Maggie--

55:04.602 --> 55:05.601
- Oh, yeah, no.

55:05.603 --> 55:06.602
I'm not allowed?

55:07.705 --> 55:09.405
- I want Luke to say it.

55:10.574 --> 55:15.110
Yeah, come on. Give a newly
divorced mom a little hope.

55:18.449 --> 55:19.415
- All right.

55:20.718 --> 55:21.717
Um...

55:25.456 --> 55:30.459
The first time I saw her
was English class.

55:30.461 --> 55:34.963
She was sitting by the window
as the sun was piercing in.

55:34.965 --> 55:37.566
You know, that classic
awe moment, right.

55:39.837 --> 55:45.341
But there was an innocence
about her that just struck me.

55:46.477 --> 55:48.243
And for whatever
mystical reason,

55:48.245 --> 55:51.680
from that moment on,
she was the girl I wanted.

55:53.384 --> 55:55.384
I remember I would
walk by her on campus

55:55.386 --> 55:57.319
or I'd see her
in the cafeteria,

55:57.321 --> 55:59.822
or at the library
or at a party.

55:59.824 --> 56:04.126
And, and the more this happened,
the more I began to create

56:04.128 --> 56:08.630
this romantic idea
of something with her.

56:08.632 --> 56:12.801
I started to dream
of us being together...

56:12.803 --> 56:15.371
without ever even saying

56:15.373 --> 56:17.539
much more than hello
to one another.

56:18.776 --> 56:23.579
But, the more I did this,
the harder it was

56:23.581 --> 56:26.782
to temper these really
intense feelings

56:26.784 --> 56:28.551
I had for this girl

56:28.552 --> 56:30.319
to a point where I could
actually connect with her

56:30.321 --> 56:31.587
like a human being,

56:31.589 --> 56:34.790
and not some angel
I had built her up to be.

56:37.695 --> 56:40.863
- But did you actually
connect with her?

56:44.235 --> 56:45.667
Uh-huh.

56:47.238 --> 56:49.838
The boat,
tell them about the boat.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.340
- Oh, a boat.
- What boat?

56:51.342 --> 56:52.708
- There's a boat.

56:55.446 --> 56:58.180
- My senior week,
right before graduation,

56:58.182 --> 57:00.716
my parents had this bay house
in Virginia.

57:00.718 --> 57:03.318
And I invited
all these people from school

57:03.320 --> 57:06.555
to drive out there
and crash for a few days.

57:06.557 --> 57:08.590
And somehow,
Maggie and her friends

57:08.592 --> 57:11.093
heard about it,
and surprisingly they showed up.

57:11.095 --> 57:12.428
- No, not surprisingly.

57:12.430 --> 57:14.062
They knew this was
Luke's last chance.

57:14.064 --> 57:15.397
Will you get to
the boat part, please?

57:15.399 --> 57:19.368
Alright, so, one afternoon,

57:19.370 --> 57:22.004
everyone was hanging out
by the pool,

57:22.006 --> 57:23.405
and she came up to me,

57:23.407 --> 57:28.310
and asked if I would
take her for a boat ride.

57:30.881 --> 57:34.349
I wanted every day
to feel like that boat ride.

57:36.086 --> 57:40.889
I remember we docked the boat
on this little man-made beach

57:40.891 --> 57:42.458
and we just sat there for hours

57:42.460 --> 57:46.361
and made up
for all the lost time.

57:46.363 --> 57:48.497
We talked about our future,
our dreams...

57:49.500 --> 57:51.934
and just what we
wanted out of life.

57:53.571 --> 57:55.871
And for those couple hours--

58:00.010 --> 58:01.643
she--

58:01.645 --> 58:05.948
she made me feel
all this... hope,

58:05.950 --> 58:07.683
like anything was possible.

58:10.421 --> 58:13.856
And then,
I know it sounds crazy,

58:13.858 --> 58:21.330
but all these dreams of love
and marriage flooded my mind.

58:22.433 --> 58:24.666
It was like
I could look across...

58:26.604 --> 58:28.971
at this girl I barely knew...

58:32.309 --> 58:34.276
and I could see my wife.

58:40.417 --> 58:44.019
- Now, ladies,
that is the guy I know.

58:48.626 --> 58:50.592
- But what happened between you?

58:50.594 --> 58:52.160
Anything?

58:52.162 --> 58:55.364
- Um, no.

58:56.567 --> 58:57.399
- What?

58:57.401 --> 58:59.535
- I had my chance, but...

58:59.537 --> 59:02.304
I was too afraid to ruin
this perfect moment.

59:02.306 --> 59:07.209
So that night,
she and her friends left.

59:07.211 --> 59:10.612
And graduation came.

59:10.614 --> 59:13.515
She moved to Europe,
and I never saw her again.

59:15.753 --> 59:18.253
- Didn't you go after her?
I mean, you loved her.

59:18.255 --> 59:20.489
Loved her?
No, I didn't love her.

59:20.491 --> 59:24.026
I mean, I was infatuated.

59:24.028 --> 59:27.329
I might have felt in love, but--

59:27.331 --> 59:29.464
- But-- See, but.

59:30.701 --> 59:34.269
Those-- those feelings,
that story you just told us,

59:34.271 --> 59:36.772
it's all part of being in love.

59:36.774 --> 59:40.742
- Those are just feelings,
it's not love.

59:40.744 --> 59:42.611
You two made it
perfectly clear tonight

59:42.613 --> 59:47.983
that love is not something you--
you create in your mind,

59:47.985 --> 59:50.686
it's not a fairytale.

59:50.687 --> 59:53.388
It's a-it's a lot more
complicated than that.

59:53.390 --> 59:54.456
- Well, hang on.

59:54.458 --> 59:55.757
- Oh, let me tell you
something, Luke.

59:55.759 --> 59:59.394
If you think it's all worth it
without the fairytale

59:59.396 --> 1:00:01.363
at least at some point
in the relationship,

1:00:01.365 --> 1:00:02.831
then you're wrong.

1:00:05.169 --> 1:00:07.569
Maybe me signing
those papers today

1:00:07.571 --> 1:00:11.173
is just more proof that
this whole idea of marriage

1:00:11.175 --> 1:00:14.910
is a myth.

1:00:14.912 --> 1:00:18.046
But the fairytale
that I had with that man

1:00:18.048 --> 1:00:20.048
in those first two years,

1:00:20.050 --> 1:00:23.619
that's the only reason
we made it through another 15.

1:00:25.589 --> 1:00:28.724
And... to tell you the truth,

1:00:28.726 --> 1:00:31.226
those moments
that you described,

1:00:31.228 --> 1:00:32.294
they still happen.

1:00:32.296 --> 1:00:36.932
They're just
tinier fragments of...

1:00:36.934 --> 1:00:39.735
a life that just becomes bigger
than the both of you.

1:00:40.938 --> 1:00:45.107
But it is those moments, Luke,
that ground you,

1:00:45.109 --> 1:00:47.376
that anchor you in life.

1:00:47.378 --> 1:00:49.478
And no matter
how far you sail away

1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:53.515
through all the pettiness,

1:00:53.517 --> 1:00:55.350
you need that stuff
to bring you back

1:00:55.352 --> 1:00:58.654
to the why of it all.

1:00:58.656 --> 1:01:05.427
To help you with the myth.

1:01:06.730 --> 1:01:09.564
Because without it,
there's nothing.

1:01:09.566 --> 1:01:12.067
Love is not
some form of practicality,

1:01:12.069 --> 1:01:13.502
and you know that.

1:01:18.342 --> 1:01:21.576
You should go.
You should go find her.

1:01:21.578 --> 1:01:23.278
I don't care how silly it is.

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:28.183
Just open your heart back up
to the possibility of something.

1:01:29.687 --> 1:01:31.219
You do owe yourself that.

1:01:33.991 --> 1:01:35.524
- To Portland.

1:01:35.526 --> 1:01:37.292
- To Portland.

1:01:37.294 --> 1:01:38.760
It would be good for you.

1:01:40.431 --> 1:01:41.730
If it doesn't work out,

1:01:41.732 --> 1:01:43.465
you can always find me
in Berkeley.

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:04.886
Are you sure
you want to give up all this?

1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:12.561
Because corporate America
is a far cry from this.

1:02:12.563 --> 1:02:13.962
You know that, right?

1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:38.019
- I know this isn't exactly

1:02:38.021 --> 1:02:39.888
what you had in mind,
but thank you.

1:02:39.890 --> 1:02:40.889
- Don't go.

1:02:43.594 --> 1:02:46.461
- Look Wes, I appreciate
everything you've done. And--

1:02:46.463 --> 1:02:48.830
I feel better, I really do.

1:02:49.700 --> 1:02:52.267
- Just stay, please.

1:02:53.470 --> 1:02:54.836
It's not just you
who needs this.

1:03:00.911 --> 1:03:02.978
- I have to do this, man.
I'm sorry.

1:03:06.550 --> 1:03:09.184
- Fine, well,
you're running late, so go.

1:03:13.023 --> 1:03:14.022
Go.

1:03:23.433 --> 1:03:24.966
Thank you for everything.

1:03:50.828 --> 1:03:52.294
<i>Hey.</i>

1:03:52.296 --> 1:03:53.628
<i>Hey, hon, how are you?</i>

1:03:54.798 --> 1:03:56.464
<i>Just walking</i>
<i>into this meeting now.</i>

1:03:56.466 --> 1:03:58.500
<i>I figured I'd give you</i>
<i>a quick ring.</i>

1:03:58.502 --> 1:04:00.101
<i>You ready?</i>

1:04:00.103 --> 1:04:01.136
<i>Um...</i>

1:04:01.138 --> 1:04:03.205
<i>Well, I actually</i>
<i>have some nerves.</i>

1:04:04.441 --> 1:04:05.774
<i>You nervous about a deal?</i>

1:04:07.678 --> 1:04:10.445
<i>It's a complicated one.</i>

1:04:10.447 --> 1:04:11.847
<i>I'm sure you'll do fine.</i>

1:04:11.849 --> 1:04:13.248
<i>People gravitate towards you.</i>

1:04:14.651 --> 1:04:16.084
<i>How's everything at home?</i>
<i>How's our girl?</i>

1:04:17.588 --> 1:04:18.920
<i>She's fine.</i>

1:04:18.922 --> 1:04:21.623
<i>She won't stop moving.</i>
<i>But that's nothing new.</i>

1:04:21.625 --> 1:04:23.358
<i>She got that from her mom.</i>

1:04:24.561 --> 1:04:25.694
<i>She certainly did.</i>

1:04:27.931 --> 1:04:29.264
<i>Let me know how it goes.</i>

1:04:29.266 --> 1:04:30.265
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

1:04:32.369 --> 1:04:33.869
<i>Love you.</i>

1:04:33.871 --> 1:04:35.036
<i>I love you, too.</i>

1:05:00.530 --> 1:05:01.663
- Thanks again.

1:05:01.665 --> 1:05:02.797
- Thank you very much.
- Yup.

1:05:02.799 --> 1:05:04.065
Thank you, guys.

1:05:04.067 --> 1:05:06.201
- We'll talk again.
- Wes, take care. Thank you.

1:05:12.776 --> 1:05:14.743
- Can I talk with you
in my office?

1:05:22.219 --> 1:05:24.085
Oh, I missed you.

1:05:25.255 --> 1:05:27.222
Oh my God, I'm so glad
it's the weekend.

1:05:27.224 --> 1:05:29.658
I have so many places
I want to show you.

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:32.294
But first, I've got us
dinner reservations

1:05:32.296 --> 1:05:34.012
at this new spot.

1:05:34.013 --> 1:05:35.729
Uh, but then, there's
this amazing overlook

1:05:35.732 --> 1:05:37.766
I found near my apartment.
So we have to go do that.

1:05:37.768 --> 1:05:39.501
Uh, but there's also--

1:05:39.503 --> 1:05:43.104
- Okay, uh, just... slow down.

1:05:45.208 --> 1:05:46.241
- Wes, what's wrong?

1:06:14.237 --> 1:06:15.203
You're a coward.

1:06:19.810 --> 1:06:21.009
- Come on.

1:06:23.714 --> 1:06:25.313
You don't want to
start a life with a guy

1:06:26.750 --> 1:06:28.750
who would have
an ex-wife and a child.

1:06:30.020 --> 1:06:31.353
- I don't care about that.

1:06:41.531 --> 1:06:42.530
- I love you.

1:06:47.804 --> 1:06:50.071
I do, but I don't
want that for you.

1:06:53.310 --> 1:06:54.309
- Don't do that.

1:06:56.013 --> 1:06:57.779
Don't make this about me.

1:07:01.885 --> 1:07:03.051
I know what I want.

1:07:05.288 --> 1:07:08.990
I want you and you want me too,
so don't make this about me.

1:07:14.231 --> 1:07:17.165
Why can't you do this
for yourself?

1:07:20.003 --> 1:07:22.170
Why are you so afraid
to be happy?

1:07:32.649 --> 1:07:33.581
I don't know.

1:08:45.088 --> 1:08:48.189
I never want to see you again.

1:08:52.796 --> 1:08:54.095
I'll forget I ever knew you.

1:10:28.158 --> 1:10:29.390
Hey.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:32.227
<i>Hey, so it's 1:30 now.</i>

1:10:32.229 --> 1:10:34.028
<i>Sunset's not until 8:00.</i>

1:10:34.030 --> 1:10:37.065
<i>I figured we should be able to</i>
<i>make it to Leggett before nigh.</i>

1:10:39.569 --> 1:10:40.568
<i>Wes?</i>

1:11:19.743 --> 1:11:21.142
What are we doing?

1:11:56.513 --> 1:11:57.512
What's wrong, man?

1:11:59.549 --> 1:12:01.582
You haven't said a word
in like five hours.

1:12:06.589 --> 1:12:07.822
- Just work stuff.

1:12:53.870 --> 1:12:56.537
- Let's just call it a night
and double back to Fort Bragg.

1:12:57.474 --> 1:12:59.741
- Kind of want to power through.

1:13:00.877 --> 1:13:03.745
Highway 1 ends in like 22 miles.

1:13:03.747 --> 1:13:06.814
- Yeah, 22 miles of dicey roads
in the middle of the woods.

1:13:08.351 --> 1:13:09.717
- Let's just keep going.

1:13:12.055 --> 1:13:13.388
- All right.

1:13:21.398 --> 1:13:24.332
Yeah, I bet it's the alternator.

1:13:24.334 --> 1:13:26.334
Why don't we get this thing
into town,

1:13:26.336 --> 1:13:28.803
and get it fixed up
first thing in the morning.

1:13:28.805 --> 1:13:29.971
I know a good shop.

1:13:29.973 --> 1:13:30.905
Where you guys headin'?

1:13:31.908 --> 1:13:33.307
- North.

1:13:33.309 --> 1:13:34.742
- What's the closest hotel
at this point?

1:13:34.744 --> 1:13:36.878
- The closest hotel,
all right, well...

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.413
I know a funky little spot.

1:13:42.118 --> 1:13:43.317
- This place
is kind of spooky.

1:13:44.687 --> 1:13:46.087
- All right. Well--

1:13:46.088 --> 1:13:47.488
Sorry it's not the Chateau,
Mr. Hollywood,

1:13:47.490 --> 1:13:49.357
but it will have to do.

1:13:50.827 --> 1:13:52.260
- You've been carrying
all this cash around

1:13:52.262 --> 1:13:53.428
the whole time?

1:13:54.564 --> 1:13:56.697
- Yup. Been a cash-only
kind of trip.

1:14:26.296 --> 1:14:27.261
Another Glen?

1:14:27.263 --> 1:14:28.296
- Uh-huh.

1:14:30.033 --> 1:14:30.998
Let's do a double.

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:42.343
- Two Moscow mules.

1:14:48.151 --> 1:14:49.350
Hello.

1:14:51.187 --> 1:14:52.386
- Hello.

1:14:53.223 --> 1:14:54.388
- How's your dinner?

1:14:55.458 --> 1:14:57.058
- Just what I needed.

1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:58.693
Been a long day.

1:14:59.729 --> 1:15:01.462
- You visiting?

1:15:01.464 --> 1:15:04.398
- Our car broke down, so we're
just-just staying the night.

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.468
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

1:15:08.571 --> 1:15:10.571
- Well, it will be ready
in the morning, so--

1:15:11.808 --> 1:15:13.040
- I'm Charles.

1:15:13.042 --> 1:15:14.041
Hi.

1:15:14.043 --> 1:15:15.042
- Diedra.

1:15:15.044 --> 1:15:16.110
- Sage.

1:15:16.112 --> 1:15:17.979
- Sage, Diedra.

1:15:17.981 --> 1:15:19.947
Here, let me get those.

1:15:22.051 --> 1:15:23.284
Yup.

1:15:26.890 --> 1:15:28.222
- Thank you.

1:15:28.224 --> 1:15:30.358
- Oh, sorry, this is
my business partner...

1:15:31.728 --> 1:15:33.561
Gary.

1:15:33.563 --> 1:15:34.695
- Gary.

1:15:37.066 --> 1:15:38.499
What kind of business?

1:15:38.501 --> 1:15:40.301
- Uh, oil business.

1:15:40.303 --> 1:15:42.904
Yeah, we are up...

1:15:42.906 --> 1:15:45.473
we're up here searching
for some new prospects.

1:15:46.309 --> 1:15:47.475
- You drilling?

1:15:51.848 --> 1:15:52.880
- Sorry.

1:15:52.882 --> 1:15:53.748
- We are drilling.

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:55.783
Uh-hmm.

1:15:55.785 --> 1:15:56.784
Why don't you
join us for a drink

1:15:56.786 --> 1:15:59.020
when you're done
with your dinner.

1:15:59.022 --> 1:15:59.954
You too, Gary.

1:16:07.497 --> 1:16:09.864
- Are you for real? Again?

1:16:12.168 --> 1:16:14.402
You're un-fucking-believable,
man.

1:16:16.306 --> 1:16:17.505
Our car's going to be ready
in the morning.

1:16:17.507 --> 1:16:19.373
Can we just sleep?

1:16:21.978 --> 1:16:24.378
- No one is forcing you
to stay out late.

1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:26.314
- Come on, Wes,
I'm here now for the endgame.

1:16:26.316 --> 1:16:27.615
You've got me, I'm in.

1:16:29.085 --> 1:16:30.718
We don't need any more detours.

1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:32.853
- Yeah, you don't need
any more detours.

1:16:34.857 --> 1:16:35.856
I--

1:16:38.428 --> 1:16:40.795
Just be quiet and let me do
what I'm going to do.

1:16:47.136 --> 1:16:48.369
- That's not even a detour,

1:16:48.371 --> 1:16:50.638
it's just--
it's just a wrong turn.

1:16:52.675 --> 1:16:54.241
- Fine.

1:16:54.243 --> 1:16:55.409
Go to bed.

1:16:59.749 --> 1:17:01.115
- Gary thinks you're an asshole.

1:17:58.675 --> 1:18:00.074
How much do you love fucking?

1:18:01.778 --> 1:18:03.811
Don't you love fucking,
Charlie?

1:18:05.915 --> 1:18:07.114
I love fucking.

1:18:09.318 --> 1:18:12.253
I'll take sex any moment,
anytime.

1:18:12.255 --> 1:18:13.788
I don't know if it's my DNA,

1:18:13.790 --> 1:18:16.757
or something from my daddy's
homemade porn videos.

1:18:17.593 --> 1:18:18.693
It was?

1:18:18.695 --> 1:18:21.162
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:18:21.164 --> 1:18:24.899
My daddy is fucked up.

1:18:24.901 --> 1:18:30.471
When I was 12, I found this
old VHS tape in his bedroom.

1:18:31.307 --> 1:18:32.973
Of course I was curious.

1:18:32.975 --> 1:18:33.941
And I watched it.

1:18:35.611 --> 1:18:40.881
And I saw my stepmom
in this old lit dark saloon,

1:18:40.883 --> 1:18:44.618
getting fucked by a bunch of men
in gorilla masks.

1:18:44.620 --> 1:18:46.687
Guess who was behind the camera?

1:18:48.591 --> 1:18:51.325
Daddy.

1:18:51.327 --> 1:18:52.893
Uh-huh.

1:18:52.895 --> 1:18:54.495
There you go.

1:18:56.099 --> 1:18:59.834
That is enough
daddy porn video talk.

1:19:01.571 --> 1:19:03.204
Let's make our own video.

1:19:03.206 --> 1:19:04.538
- Yeah.

1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:06.140
- You want to make a video,
Charlie?

1:19:08.811 --> 1:19:10.511
Come on, you have
too much clothes on.

1:19:10.513 --> 1:19:12.480
- Alright.

1:19:14.417 --> 1:19:17.051
- I'm going to do this
all for the video.

1:19:18.221 --> 1:19:19.186
Where's your phone?

1:19:21.524 --> 1:19:22.957
- Yes.
- Wait a sec.

1:19:24.527 --> 1:19:27.228
- Umm, look at the oilman's ass.

1:19:27.230 --> 1:19:28.429
That's a fucked-up story.

1:21:10.066 --> 1:21:12.466
Are we going to make it
to Portland?

1:21:12.468 --> 1:21:14.568
- You should be okay, but...

1:21:14.570 --> 1:21:16.203
I'd get a proper check
once there.

1:21:18.074 --> 1:21:19.840
My wife will get you
squared away.

1:21:19.842 --> 1:21:22.142
- Oh, yeah,
I'll have your bill in a sec.

1:21:22.144 --> 1:21:24.612
- Hey, babe, you good?

1:21:24.614 --> 1:21:26.614
- Yeah.
- That was the--

1:21:26.616 --> 1:21:27.982
- Alternator.
- Yes.

1:21:27.984 --> 1:21:30.584
- And the check of the filter.
- Yes, that's right.

1:21:30.586 --> 1:21:31.952
Okay. Love you.

1:21:31.954 --> 1:21:35.923
Um, I'll put the key
in the-in the Bronco.

1:21:35.925 --> 1:21:38.959
- Thanks.
- Hey, Rex, I'll follow you out.

1:21:38.961 --> 1:21:40.160
I've got a quick question.

1:21:41.397 --> 1:21:43.964
<i>So, uh, if I turn my fan on--</i>

1:21:51.374 --> 1:21:52.373
- How long has it been?

1:21:53.376 --> 1:21:54.375
- Hmm?

1:21:57.747 --> 1:22:02.816
Aww! 51 years.

1:22:03.653 --> 1:22:05.419
- Wow! What's the secret?

1:22:08.958 --> 1:22:13.761
Oh!
There's been a lot of...

1:22:13.763 --> 1:22:15.763
life since that photo.

1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:18.866
A lot of change.

1:22:21.003 --> 1:22:22.736
But with all that change...

1:22:26.309 --> 1:22:29.110
I guess it's about

1:22:29.111 --> 1:22:31.912
always working to find
each other in the end.

1:22:35.651 --> 1:22:36.850
- That's beautiful.

1:22:38.087 --> 1:22:39.086
- Thank you.

1:22:41.590 --> 1:22:43.691
- All right.
What's the damage?

1:22:43.693 --> 1:22:44.892
What do I owe ya?

1:22:44.894 --> 1:22:46.427
- It's not too bad.

1:22:48.130 --> 1:22:49.296
There you go.

1:22:50.700 --> 1:22:51.966
- Great.

1:23:07.249 --> 1:23:10.050
Fuck! Fuck!

1:23:10.052 --> 1:23:12.286
- Are you okay?
- Ah, yeah. Sorry.

1:23:12.288 --> 1:23:14.555
Um, I, I've got some money
in the car.

1:23:14.557 --> 1:23:15.622
I'll be back.

1:23:33.743 --> 1:23:35.442
- I might finally
have some reception.

1:23:37.513 --> 1:23:38.946
Sarah called me.

1:23:41.117 --> 1:23:43.150
Why's your wife
calling me, Wes?

1:23:44.987 --> 1:23:46.186
She left me a message.

1:23:46.188 --> 1:23:47.821
- Do, do not listen
to that voicemail.

1:23:47.823 --> 1:23:50.190
- Oh, wait! She left me
four fucking messages.

1:23:51.327 --> 1:23:53.627
Why, why do I have four fucking
messages from your wife, Wes?

1:23:53.629 --> 1:23:54.661
- You know,
just give me the phone!

1:23:54.663 --> 1:23:55.763
- No!

1:23:55.765 --> 1:23:57.031
- Just give me
the fucking phone!

1:23:57.033 --> 1:23:57.731
Give me the phone.
- Why? They're clearly for me.

1:23:57.733 --> 1:23:59.066
- Give me the goddamn phone!

1:24:03.172 --> 1:24:04.938
- What happened
in San Francisco, Wes?

1:24:07.109 --> 1:24:08.575
You've been fucking dark
ever since.

1:24:08.577 --> 1:24:09.576
Somethin' happened.

1:24:11.947 --> 1:24:13.814
The man with all the answers.

1:24:13.816 --> 1:24:15.849
And the one time
I actually ask for one,

1:24:15.851 --> 1:24:17.618
you won't give it to me.

1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:19.053
Just be honest!

1:24:21.223 --> 1:24:23.190
- I was having
a fucking affair!

1:24:26.228 --> 1:24:27.294
Okay?

1:24:29.265 --> 1:24:31.698
I fell in love
with a woman from work.

1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:32.933
Are you happy now?

1:24:35.671 --> 1:24:38.172
But I ended it.

1:24:38.174 --> 1:24:39.173
I ended it.

1:24:40.076 --> 1:24:42.076
Because no matter
how much I love her,

1:24:42.078 --> 1:24:43.911
I don't want to ruin my family.

1:24:47.149 --> 1:24:48.649
But I did not sleep
with those women last night.

1:24:48.651 --> 1:24:49.983
They robbed me, okay?

1:24:49.985 --> 1:24:51.018
That's why
I'm freaking out right now.

1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:52.820
They took my credit cards,
my AMEX cards,

1:24:52.822 --> 1:24:54.988
and Sarah has access
to my AMEX cards,

1:24:54.990 --> 1:24:56.623
and I'm sure she's seen
the fraud charges

1:24:56.625 --> 1:24:58.025
and knows something's up.

1:25:04.767 --> 1:25:05.999
You're right.

1:25:08.804 --> 1:25:11.905
I'm supposed to have
all the answers.

1:25:11.907 --> 1:25:13.607
You're the one guy
that knows I don't.

1:25:22.785 --> 1:25:25.953
- Why didn't you tell me
about it before?

1:25:25.955 --> 1:25:27.488
- You wouldn't
answer the phone.

1:26:20.476 --> 1:26:22.376
<i>Wes, where are you?</i>

1:26:22.378 --> 1:26:25.412
<i>The hotel in San Francisco</i>
<i>says you never checked in.</i>

1:26:25.414 --> 1:26:27.748
<i>There's all these strange</i>
<i>charges on the credit card.</i>

1:26:27.750 --> 1:26:28.882
<i>I don't know where you are,</i>

1:26:28.884 --> 1:26:30.050
I don't know what's going on,

1:26:30.052 --> 1:26:32.686
I,
you don't answer your phone.

1:26:41.363 --> 1:26:43.797
<i>I don't care what's going on.</i>

1:26:43.799 --> 1:26:46.066
I just need you to call me
and let me know you're okay

1:26:46.068 --> 1:26:47.701
'cause I'm kind of
freaking out here.

1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:00.647
<i>Call me please, okay?</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

1:27:53.202 --> 1:27:55.335
- Eventually, our boss
got wind of the affair.

1:27:57.473 --> 1:27:59.106
And he couldn't allow things
to move forward

1:27:59.108 --> 1:28:00.474
the way they were going.

1:28:01.543 --> 1:28:03.910
But he needed us both.

1:28:03.912 --> 1:28:05.279
Thank God.

1:28:06.649 --> 1:28:10.517
So he had Jennifer take over
the San Francisco office...

1:28:13.489 --> 1:28:15.522
Left me in D.C.

1:28:15.524 --> 1:28:16.690
And um...

1:28:21.130 --> 1:28:23.463
for the past year,
I've been living a double life

1:28:23.465 --> 1:28:25.132
with a woman
across the country.

1:28:32.074 --> 1:28:33.607
- I should have
picked up the phone.

1:28:33.609 --> 1:28:35.275
- No, man, it's okay.

1:28:35.277 --> 1:28:36.843
- No, no. I should've.

1:28:37.946 --> 1:28:39.379
I should have been
there for you.

1:28:42.685 --> 1:28:43.817
I'm sorry.

1:28:46.288 --> 1:28:47.688
- You're here now.

1:28:56.965 --> 1:28:59.299
Jeez.

1:28:59.301 --> 1:29:01.702
I don't know
what I'm doing. Fuck.

1:29:04.473 --> 1:29:05.706
I don't know.

1:29:11.914 --> 1:29:13.480
- Wes, look, man.

1:29:15.584 --> 1:29:18.752
I don't have
a clue about marriage.

1:29:18.754 --> 1:29:19.753
I don't know what it's like.

1:29:19.755 --> 1:29:20.821
I'm just some single dude

1:29:20.823 --> 1:29:25.158
who's spent the majority
of his adult life alone.

1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:29.262
So, who am I to give you
advice, right?

1:29:34.570 --> 1:29:35.869
But what the fuck!

1:29:35.870 --> 1:29:37.169
You can't lie your way
through the rest of your life.

1:29:37.172 --> 1:29:38.372
What's the point?

1:29:40.642 --> 1:29:43.043
You're just
going to hurt people,

1:29:43.045 --> 1:29:44.544
people important to you.

1:29:47.750 --> 1:29:50.717
So just...

1:29:50.719 --> 1:29:52.319
just make a choice.

1:29:53.622 --> 1:29:54.855
And stick with it.

1:30:01.730 --> 1:30:03.463
<i>We are reading to begin</i>

1:30:03.465 --> 1:30:05.932
<i>security screening for Flight</i>
<i>310 with service to Sacramento.</i>

1:30:05.934 --> 1:30:08.001
<i>At this time, if you'd gather</i>
<i>your personal items</i>

1:30:08.003 --> 1:30:10.504
<i>and have your boarding pass</i>
<i>and your photo ID out</i>

1:30:10.506 --> 1:30:12.873
<i>and available for myself</i>
<i>and the TSA agents</i>

1:30:12.875 --> 1:30:14.474
<i>when you get to the checkpoint.</i>

1:30:19.948 --> 1:30:21.348
- It was fun, buddy.

1:30:25.754 --> 1:30:27.421
- What am I supposed to do
with the Bronco?

1:30:30.692 --> 1:30:31.825
- Keep it.

1:30:32.961 --> 1:30:34.194
Come here.

1:30:35.397 --> 1:30:37.330
And I don't need to tell you
what to do with it.

1:30:38.467 --> 1:30:40.300
You're ten miles from Oregon.

1:30:40.302 --> 1:30:42.502
Come on, Wes.

1:30:42.504 --> 1:30:45.839
- That Maggie thing is real.

1:30:45.841 --> 1:30:47.407
She asked about you.

1:30:53.615 --> 1:30:54.748
Look...

1:30:56.018 --> 1:30:58.351
you're right.

1:30:58.353 --> 1:31:00.887
I had to lie to get
a little freedom for myself

1:31:00.889 --> 1:31:04.257
and, I hurt some people.

1:31:05.060 --> 1:31:06.493
But...

1:31:08.464 --> 1:31:09.996
You don't have to lie.

1:31:11.066 --> 1:31:12.532
And...

1:31:12.534 --> 1:31:14.634
right now,
you're only hurting yourself.

1:31:20.809 --> 1:31:23.143
- Get on the plane.

1:31:23.145 --> 1:31:24.444
Go on.

1:31:36.091 --> 1:31:37.858
- You know what to do
with that Bronco.

1:32:05.821 --> 1:32:07.387
<i>Luke, it's Phil again.</i>

1:32:07.389 --> 1:32:08.855
<i>Give me a call</i>
<i>when you get a chance.</i>

1:32:08.857 --> 1:32:10.290
<i>Second voicemail.</i>

1:32:10.292 --> 1:32:12.125
<i>I don't know where you are,</i>
<i>I don't know what's going on,</i>

1:32:12.127 --> 1:32:13.426
<i>and I don't know</i>
<i>what you're doing,</i>

1:32:13.428 --> 1:32:15.729
<i>but you gotta get on</i>
<i>that airplane, man.</i>

1:32:15.731 --> 1:32:17.697
<i>Remember, I put myself</i>
<i>out there for this</i>

1:32:17.699 --> 1:32:18.798
so don't screw me over.

1:34:33.502 --> 1:34:35.568
- Hey, buddy!

1:34:35.570 --> 1:34:37.103
Want to make a quick 20 bucks?
