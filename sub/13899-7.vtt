00:03.250 --> 00:04.830
[Jake] Come up to the
cabin, you said.

00:04.880 --> 00:05.420
It'll be a laugh, you said.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.000
Yes b'y.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.750
[Mal] Quit trying to shift the
blame. This is all your fault.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.670
What fault? I'm the one
hanging back, sheltering you.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.920
Sheltering me?

00:11.970 --> 00:14.220
From over here,
you just look lazy and slow.

00:14.260 --> 00:16.140
Look, just-- Hang on.

00:17.430 --> 00:18.970
I think we lost them.
[gunshot]

00:19.020 --> 00:20.230
Or not! Come on.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.270
An electric fence?

00:26.820 --> 00:28.110
Parson's land.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.860
He's a little paranoid
after his cabin was robbed

00:29.900 --> 00:31.320
a few summers ago.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.320
A little?

00:33.360 --> 00:34.780
Is it still active?

00:34.820 --> 00:35.620
Easy way to find out.

00:36.030 --> 00:36.910
Ahhh!

00:41.290 --> 00:42.460
You electrocuted me!

00:42.500 --> 00:43.410
Your own son.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.330
I had to be sure.

00:44.370 --> 00:45.960
What now?
[gunshot]

00:46.000 --> 00:49.420
Well, either we jump this fence
and get electrocuted.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.550
Or we face
a firing squad.

It's about quality.

It's good to be here.

Yeah. I'm glad we made the trip.
It's been a while.

You're the father.

Where's my rod?

02:17.880 --> 02:19.470
Your rod.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.680
I would say it's about
thirty feet--

02:22.720 --> 02:23.890
that way.

02:23.930 --> 02:25.270
You know it's got a

What do you got?

02:49.830 --> 02:50.790
I don't know.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.760
But we need to find out.

02:59.590 --> 03:00.930
Sergeant Bennett.

03:00.970 --> 03:02.260
What are you doing in? I
thought it was your day off.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.970
It is. I'm just getting
something from my office.

03:04.010 --> 03:05.220
I was never here.

03:06.470 --> 03:08.180
I thought we were meeting later.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.980
I'm sorry. Something's come up.
I need your help.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.900
Some supplies have gone missing
from a military installation.

03:12.940 --> 03:13.440
Supplies?

03:14.610 --> 03:15.860
I got a feeling we're
not talking about

03:15.900 --> 03:17.190
the standard office variety.

03:17.230 --> 03:20.280
No. Flash bangs, vests,
gas masks, you name it.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.070
Let's go to my office.
We can file a report.

03:22.110 --> 03:22.990
No, no, no.
We can't do that.

03:23.780 --> 03:24.700
Whoever took them used my

03:24.740 --> 03:25.620
clearance information.

03:25.660 --> 03:27.200
My buddy gave me the heads up,

03:27.240 --> 03:29.080
But I've only got twelve hours
to find the person responsible

03:29.120 --> 03:30.420
before the military finds out
what's missing.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.130
And if they do--

03:33.040 --> 03:34.040
I could go to jail.

03:36.590 --> 03:38.170
Look. I already
have a lead.

03:38.210 --> 03:40.260
Apparently this
woman bought the stuff.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.050
I'm thinking maybe she
can take us to the seller.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.260
[Leslie]
Francis Lemont.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.010
I know exactly how to find her.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.020
Bit early for hunting season.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.610
I didn't know anybody else
was out here.

03:58.650 --> 03:59.440
What's under the tarp?

04:00.860 --> 04:02.200
Oh. We didn't meant to do it.
It was an accident.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.030
What my brother-in-law

04:03.070 --> 04:04.530
is trying to say here, is--

04:04.570 --> 04:06.570
Well, we were just out here
enjoying the great outdoors

04:06.620 --> 04:08.700
when a caribou charged right
at us. I didn't have a choice.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.660
It was either him or me.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.420
And you just happened
to have a rifle ready.

04:12.830 --> 04:13.920
Well--

04:13.960 --> 04:14.880
You never know
when you're gonna

04:14.920 --> 04:15.750
need one.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.420
Hey, I'm Pete--

04:17.460 --> 04:19.590
by the way.
This is Rick.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.050
We're just staying up the road.

04:21.090 --> 04:21.670
I gotta be honest, b'ys.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.010
This kinda looks
like two fellas

04:24.050 --> 04:26.140
out trying to get
a caribou on the sly.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.850
[Des]
If you're poachers,

04:27.890 --> 04:28.970
we're gonna have
to report you.

04:29.020 --> 04:29.930
Listen-

04:29.970 --> 04:31.020
It was an accident, alright.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.350
I'm gonna call the
wildlife officials

04:32.390 --> 04:33.350
as soon as I get
into cell phone range.

04:34.310 --> 04:35.730
You guys get a
signal out here?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.770
Not for miles.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.400
Oh, well. I'll call as soon
as I get some bars.

04:42.570 --> 04:43.610
It was nice to meet you.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.000
They seem off to you?

04:52.750 --> 04:53.620
B'ys?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.750
That was not a caribou.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.510
[Sloan] No offence,
Rose. I know this is

05:05.550 --> 05:06.590
your livelihood or

05:06.640 --> 05:09.050
whatever, But-- It's
boring as hell.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.930
To be honest,
I like doing paperwork.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.350
Bit of a weirdo
that way, but--

05:12.390 --> 05:14.390
You know, if I didn't do this,
we'd never get paid.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.230
[Leslie]
Rose.

05:16.270 --> 05:18.190
Sloan-
I hope I'm not interrupting.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.730
No, no, of course not.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.780
It's nice to see you.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.780
Yeah, you haven't been
around much since you ripped

05:23.820 --> 05:26.070
Jake's heart out of his
chest and fed it to him.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.620
Okay, off you go.
Over there.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.570
Bye, bye.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.120
Now, sorry about that.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.620
It's nice to see you.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.410
You too.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.580
I actually came to ask a favor.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.500
Okay.

05:37.460 --> 05:39.540
Oh. Francis Lemont.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.250
Every time
I cross paths with this woman,

05:41.300 --> 05:42.800
I end up arrested or abducted.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.880
[Leslie] On the down low--
Looks like she's been

05:45.920 --> 05:47.090
buying military
supplies.

05:47.550 --> 05:48.510
Military?

05:48.550 --> 05:49.930
This doesn't happened to have

05:49.970 --> 05:52.260
anything to do with a certain
undead husband, does it?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.970
It does.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.140
Do you know where
Francis might be?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.390
She's been spotted in town

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
since she finished
her sentence at Grand Valley.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.690
You know, if Francis is back,

06:00.730 --> 06:02.360
there are a few places
that she could be.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.030
I could show you,
if you want.

06:04.070 --> 06:06.070
[Leslie] Thanks Rose. But I
can't put you in any danger.

06:06.110 --> 06:07.070
And--

06:07.110 --> 06:09.160
This stays in your office. Okay?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.120
Of course.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.620
Um--

06:13.540 --> 06:14.450
There.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.410
Good luck.

06:15.450 --> 06:16.330
Thanks.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.000
Whatever she was just
saying to you--

06:20.040 --> 06:21.540
sounds way more fun that
sitting around here

06:21.590 --> 06:22.290
filing papers.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.460
Hmmm.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.300
Yeah, but if Francis Lemont
is involved,

06:25.340 --> 06:27.720
the farther away we are,
the better.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.600
[Des]
Okay. There's the truck.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.640
But I don't see that buddy Rick,
or his buddy Pete anywhere.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.980
I mean, I assume
that they're buddies.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.770
Any sign of the body?

06:43.520 --> 06:44.440
No.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.650
Wait, wait, wait.

06:45.690 --> 06:46.900
Rick's here.
He's inside the trailer.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.110
I'm gonna guess he's not
looking for his keys.

06:50.070 --> 06:50.990
Robbery gone wrong?

06:51.030 --> 06:51.910
Maybe.

06:52.490 --> 06:53.490
Wait a minute.

06:53.530 --> 06:54.450
Who owns the other rig,
there?

06:54.490 --> 06:55.160
The victim's?

06:55.200 --> 06:56.370
One of the b'ys?

06:56.410 --> 06:57.540
[Des] The hood's open.
Looks like it's been

06:57.580 --> 06:59.420
tampered with.
There's wires everywhere.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.540
[Mal]
Quebec plates.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.540
Yeah. It's the same
as the truck.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.800
Long way to go for a bit of
caribou poaching.

07:04.840 --> 07:05.590
I'm going in. Just--

07:06.340 --> 07:07.670
Don't let me get killed.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.590
Be careful.

07:32.450 --> 07:35.330
[Des]
Oh, oh. Oh. Mal.

07:35.370 --> 07:36.240
It's okay.
Jake sees him.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.870
Speaking of--
A heads up,

07:41.920 --> 07:43.210
as it were.

07:43.250 --> 07:43.960
There's an important matter
I've been meeting to

07:44.000 --> 07:45.540
discuss with you,

07:45.590 --> 07:47.090
that has serious implications
and subsequent ramifications.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.420
Des. Now is not the time.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.010
I know, I know, but see--

07:51.050 --> 07:53.140
I'm not the same person I was
three years ago,

07:53.180 --> 07:54.510
when you took me in.

07:54.550 --> 07:57.390
I've changed. I've grown.

07:57.430 --> 08:02.900
It's time for me to
spread my wings and fly.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.610
Des. Shhh.

08:08.610 --> 08:09.780
Oh my God.

08:10.820 --> 08:11.740
What do we do?

08:11.780 --> 08:12.700
I'll use my duck call.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.570
[duck sound]

08:17.530 --> 08:18.790
[Pete] What do you
mean it's not there?

08:18.830 --> 08:20.410
I mean, it's not there.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.080
Now, we need to find it.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.040
You better have held up your
end of the bargain.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.000
It's done.

08:24.040 --> 08:24.830
[noise]

08:25.540 --> 08:26.460
What are you doing?

08:31.880 --> 08:32.840
It worked.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.220
Nice.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.100
[Rick] Do you know how
not to make noise?

08:43.640 --> 08:44.400
Any sign of the body?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.650
No.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.190
But the truck's covered
in blood. And look.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.110
I found an I.D.

08:49.150 --> 08:50.070
Sean Barrett.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.030
Ever hear of him?

08:51.070 --> 08:51.650
His parents own the trailer.

08:51.690 --> 08:52.860
At least they did

08:52.900 --> 08:52.940
when your mother
and I used to come up here.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.530
Whatever Rick and Peter
were after,

08:55.570 --> 08:56.490
I don't think they found it.

08:56.530 --> 08:57.450
It must have been
pretty valuable,

08:57.490 --> 08:58.160
if they killed him for it.

08:58.200 --> 08:58.950
Des,

08:58.990 --> 09:00.450
you follow
the tracks.

09:00.490 --> 09:02.200
See if it leads to where they
may have stashed the body.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.330
Okay, no problem.
Quick question.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.420
If I were true
north, I'd be...

09:05.460 --> 09:06.880
where?

09:06.920 --> 09:10.300
Des. Just follow the path.
And break off some branches.

09:10.340 --> 09:11.340
That way you'll know
how to get back.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.760
Dad, what do you think?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.420
Wanna go inside the trailer?
See what they were after?

09:14.470 --> 09:16.470
What about you?
What are you going at?

09:16.510 --> 09:17.510
I'll follow
Rick and Pete.

09:18.550 --> 09:19.720
I knew these would
come in handy.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.890
I though these might be fun

09:20.930 --> 09:21.930
while we were trouting,
you know?

09:21.970 --> 09:22.390
Take it, take it.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.350
Salmon peel are jumping like
cracked over here.

09:26.270 --> 09:27.810
Mud trout are maggoty over here.

09:27.860 --> 09:28.770
Etcetera.

09:28.810 --> 09:29.690
Shut up!

09:30.400 --> 09:31.730
Brilliant. Good job.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.690
Don't let it go to your head--

09:32.730 --> 09:33.740
like it does Jake's.

09:33.780 --> 09:34.490
And you.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.610
Be careful.

09:35.650 --> 09:37.160
Rifle beats trouting poles
every time.

09:51.210 --> 09:52.250
[snap]

10:25.450 --> 10:27.160
Guess you're not
hunting caribou, Rick.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.080
Please don't let me
find the body.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.540
Please don't let me
find the body.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.710
Please don't let me
find the body.

10:34.340 --> 10:35.300
[twig snapping]

10:39.970 --> 10:41.050
Please don't let that
be a coyote.

10:41.090 --> 10:42.760
Please don't let that
be a coyote.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.620
[woman screams]

11:01.660 --> 11:02.870
[Des screams]

11:02.910 --> 11:03.780
[punch]

11:07.120 --> 11:08.120
[twig snapping]

11:08.160 --> 11:09.540
Hey, what was that?

11:09.580 --> 11:12.000
Would you watch that?
It's nothing. I told you.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.750
Look. You wanted to be
in the business.

11:13.790 --> 11:14.460
This is the business.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.760
Hey. I didn't know that we were
gonna kill Barrett.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.300
Ah.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.680
What?

11:20.720 --> 11:22.720
Look. He took something
that didn't belong to him.

11:22.760 --> 11:22.800
And that is the punishment.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.890
And thanks to your stupidity, it
didn't go as planned, did it?

11:26.930 --> 11:28.060
Don't pin this on me.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.480
I never
held a gun before.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.440
I don't know what I'm doing
with this thing. Come on!

11:31.810 --> 11:33.350
Ahh.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.400
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I thought you were one of them.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.740
It's okay. It's okay.

11:40.280 --> 11:40.900
Veronica.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.160
Des.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.280
Okay. Listen, Des.
We need to get outta here,

11:44.320 --> 11:45.280
Like, now.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.580
I saw something
I shouldn't have.

11:46.620 --> 11:47.790
And now these creepy dudes
are after me.

11:47.830 --> 11:50.200
Let me guess.
A big guy with dark eyes.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.880
And a smaller, sort of twitchy
guy who's eye color escapes me.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.960
Yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.920
I think I saw them
kill somebody.

11:54.960 --> 11:55.840
Like--

11:55.880 --> 11:57.250
Shoot him.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.170
And we have to call the police,
because they saw me,

11:59.210 --> 12:00.130
and they know
I'm out here.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.630
Okay, okay. Don't worry.

12:01.670 --> 12:03.760
I'm out here with my two
best friends, alright.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.800
We're private investigators.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.470
We can help, okay?

12:06.510 --> 12:07.430
Okay.

12:07.470 --> 12:08.640
Let me just call my partner.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.680
Juniper? Snotty Var.
Do you copy?

12:12.810 --> 12:14.270
They're code names. Don't
worry, you'll get one too.

12:14.310 --> 12:15.230
Jake.

12:15.270 --> 12:16.150
Where are you?

12:16.690 --> 12:17.610
Jake?

12:17.650 --> 12:18.650
That was something!

12:18.690 --> 12:21.240
Jake. I need you.
Courtney to Doyle.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.120
These don't look
that great.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.620
How many cores do they have?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.130
What? Cores? What?

12:35.170 --> 12:37.540
Processors.
Core processors?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.630
Oh. Lots.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.840
No, they're
great. Trust me. Yeah .

12:40.880 --> 12:41.720
Trust you.

12:42.260 --> 12:43.130
Not likely.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.470
Cops?

12:46.550 --> 12:48.100
Put your hands where
I can see 'em.

12:48.140 --> 12:49.060
Nice work.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.060
You led them
right to me.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.100
[Callum] Don't take
this personally.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.350
But take a hike.

12:56.310 --> 12:57.520
See ya later.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.860
I paid for all of this.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.280
Right. So I'm sure you
have a receipt.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.820
I might not.

13:03.860 --> 13:04.990
[Callum]
We're looking for

13:05.030 --> 13:06.450
a guy who's selling
military supplies.

13:06.490 --> 13:08.030
You know anything
about that?

13:08.070 --> 13:11.250
Okay, I might know a guy, if you
give me a break on the laptops.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.080
Flash bang.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.630
So what were you
planning to do with this?

13:20.880 --> 13:23.260
I didn't want any military
anything. Okay.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.800
I was just waiting on
a shipment of blue-rays.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.140
He promised to
deliver and never came through.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.600
And he tried to pay me
in this stuff.

13:30.890 --> 13:32.730
Can you point him
out to us?

13:34.140 --> 13:35.020
Really?

13:39.110 --> 13:40.070
Yeah.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.280
Ian Beverly.
Kind of a bell head.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.530
[Callum] He was discharged from
the base about a year ago.

13:45.570 --> 13:46.450
He's a mechanic.

13:46.490 --> 13:47.410
Are we good?

13:47.450 --> 13:48.320
Have any more of these?

13:51.530 --> 13:52.870
Want a sandwich
with that?

13:58.460 --> 13:59.340
Francis.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.460
Looks like
you've got company.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.460
What do we have here?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.630
A spy.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.630
Ah. Who are you?

14:06.680 --> 14:07.630
And what do you want?

14:07.680 --> 14:08.840
Wait, wait.

14:08.890 --> 14:09.760
Francis.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.770
I know Rose Doyle.

14:13.930 --> 14:15.730
You do?

14:17.640 --> 14:18.520
[gunshot]

14:18.980 --> 14:19.860
[bang]

14:22.110 --> 14:22.980
[bang]

14:24.610 --> 14:25.570
Jake.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.240
[Jake] Get out of the trailer

14:28.200 --> 14:29.820
Get out
of the trailer, Dad!

14:29.870 --> 14:30.780
Dad!

14:30.820 --> 14:32.580
Get out! Come on!

14:32.620 --> 14:33.700
[bang]

14:35.540 --> 14:36.410
[bang]

14:43.210 --> 14:44.670
[Jake] Come up to the
cabin, you said.

14:44.710 --> 14:45.460
It'll be laugh,
you said.

14:45.510 --> 14:46.970
Yes, b'y.

14:47.010 --> 14:48.420
Quit trying to shift the blame.
This is all your fault.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.510
What fault? I'm the one hanging
back, sheltering you.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.300
Sheltering me?

14:52.350 --> 14:54.390
From over here, you
just look lazy and slow.

14:54.430 --> 14:55.350
Just--

14:55.390 --> 14:56.600
Hang on.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.230
I think we lost 'em.

14:58.270 --> 14:59.190
[bang]

14:59.230 --> 15:00.150
Or not.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.060
Come on!

15:03.570 --> 15:04.440
[bang]

15:07.570 --> 15:08.650
[bang]

15:10.530 --> 15:11.410
[bang]

15:13.950 --> 15:14.910
[Jake]
An electric fence?

15:15.580 --> 15:16.370
Parson's land.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.620
He is a little paranoid

15:17.660 --> 15:19.120
after his cabin was robbed
a few summers ago.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.460
A little?

15:21.710 --> 15:23.000
Is it still active?

15:23.040 --> 15:23.880
Easy way to find out.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.170
Ahhh!

15:29.720 --> 15:30.630
You electrocuted me!

15:30.680 --> 15:31.590
Your own son.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.550
Had to be sure.

15:32.590 --> 15:33.510
What now?

15:33.550 --> 15:33.930
[gunshot]

15:35.430 --> 15:38.430
Well, either we jump this fence
and get electrocuted,

15:38.480 --> 15:41.020
or we face
a firing squad.

15:42.020 --> 15:43.860
I'd be open
to a third option.

15:45.980 --> 15:47.070
I got an idea.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.450
Now where did they go?

15:56.370 --> 15:57.330
They must have gone this way.

15:57.370 --> 15:58.450
Hey.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.410
I think they hopped the fence.

15:59.450 --> 16:00.580
Ahh!

16:09.010 --> 16:09.720
Idiot.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.220
What does my sister see in you?

16:12.260 --> 16:14.010
I don't know what she sees
in you either.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.110
That was close.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.280
Pete gives new meaning
to stund as toast.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.980
Alright. Look.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.150
Let's just get back
to the cabin,

16:31.190 --> 16:33.320
grab the truck and get the--

16:35.530 --> 16:36.910
Dad, is that your --

16:36.950 --> 16:39.580
My truck. Yep. Looks like
they don't want us leaving.

16:40.540 --> 16:41.660
I guess we're stranded.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.170
Yeah, with a couple of
homicidal maniacs.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.340
[Jake] Des, how did
you manage to find

16:50.380 --> 16:52.090
a hot girl in the
middle of the woods?

16:52.130 --> 16:53.590
It's a long story.

16:53.630 --> 16:55.890
Rick and Pete have got our only
mode of transportation.

16:55.930 --> 16:56.970
It's only a matter of time

16:57.010 --> 16:58.140
before they circle back
to get us.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.430
Well, maybe--

16:59.470 --> 17:01.230
Veronica, do you
have, like, a car, or anything?

17:02.310 --> 17:03.810
I just hitchhiked from
St. John's.

17:03.850 --> 17:04.770
I'm sorry.

17:04.810 --> 17:05.730
All due respect.

17:05.770 --> 17:06.980
You don't seem
like an avid

17:07.020 --> 17:08.730
trouter,
or whatever.

17:08.770 --> 17:10.280
So what are you doing in

17:10.320 --> 17:11.230
the middle of nowhere?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.610
I just like the outdoors.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.320
I have a tent out there
somewhere.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.910
But I lost my GPS
and I don't know where I am.

17:15.950 --> 17:18.950
Jake, Jake. She's been
through a lot, okay.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.030
First she saw Barrett get killed

17:20.080 --> 17:21.160
and now Rick and Pete
are after her.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.410
They're after all of us.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.290
Speaking of the b'ys.
Who are they, anyway?

17:24.330 --> 17:27.630
Rick is the scarier of
the two murderers.

17:27.670 --> 17:28.880
And he's pretty handy
with a rifle.

17:28.920 --> 17:29.840
Is that my camera?

17:29.880 --> 17:31.340
Rose said I could borrow it.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.590
And then there's Pete.

17:33.630 --> 17:34.840
He said that he's
Rick's brother-in-law.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.050
And they're from Quebec,

17:36.090 --> 17:37.140
if we wanna go
by the plates on the truck.

17:38.220 --> 17:40.220
According to this
driver's license--

17:40.260 --> 17:42.140
Barrett-- The one that
the b'ys killed.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.230
He's also from Montreal.

17:44.270 --> 17:44.310
Rue St. Marc.

17:45.390 --> 17:46.140
Must have followed
them out here.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.650
Why?

17:47.690 --> 17:50.400
Rick said that Barrett had
something that belonged to them.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.360
[Veronica] We can't
just sit around here

17:51.400 --> 17:52.570
and wait to be
executed.

17:52.610 --> 17:54.110
Do we have any guns
around here, or what?

17:54.150 --> 17:55.650
For, you know, bears,
or whatever?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.280
Jake. You know I don't carry
guns around here.

17:58.950 --> 18:01.740
Well, we're going to need to do
something to defend ourselves.

18:01.790 --> 18:02.700
You two.

18:02.740 --> 18:03.660
Take the bunk beds.

18:03.700 --> 18:04.960
Put it up against that wall.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.880
You and me. We're gonna have
to find something to work with.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.050
No. I haven't talked to Sloan
since yesterday.

18:13.090 --> 18:14.010
[Rose]
Never mind.

18:14.050 --> 18:15.220
She just walked in.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.180
Finally. Where have you been?

18:18.220 --> 18:19.140
First off.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.560
I'm pretty sorry
about all this.

18:22.430 --> 18:23.560
[Francis]
Oh Rose.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.220
Really? After all
we've been through.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.940
And you go rat me
out to the cops.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.440
Not nice.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.400
[Rose]
Okay. Wait.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.270
No need to point a gun at her.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.650
I'm sure you and I can
work something out.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.190
I'm sure we can.

18:34.230 --> 18:37.070
So this supplier
douche bag, Ian--

18:37.110 --> 18:38.360
He owes me big time.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.160
And you're gonna help
me get even.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.620
What do you got?

18:43.660 --> 18:47.750
Well, I got five tranq darts,
and no tranquilizer gun.

18:47.790 --> 18:48.750
And...

18:48.790 --> 18:51.080
A flare gun with no flares.

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
You?

18:53.630 --> 18:54.590
Old tackle.

18:54.630 --> 18:55.880
A few hooks and lines.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.840
Bug spray.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.760
Oh, and this.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.300
I found a whole
arsenal of weapons

19:00.340 --> 19:01.720
over in the Barrett trailer.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.140
You have a bag full of guns.

19:04.180 --> 19:05.890
You didn't think that was
relevant information for me?

19:05.930 --> 19:06.810
I didn't take their guns,
dumb-dumb.

19:08.350 --> 19:10.730
So you left Rick and Pete with
their own personal armory.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.110
Yeah.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.320
But what good is an armory,

19:13.360 --> 19:14.480
without ammo?

19:17.780 --> 19:19.400
Nice work, skipper.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.910
I can work with this.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.080
You want vests and flash bangs.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.410
Sorry miss,
I ain't buying it.

19:27.450 --> 19:28.370
That's too bad.

19:28.410 --> 19:29.920
'Cause--

19:30.620 --> 19:31.960
I brought the cash.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.540
Well. I'm not selling.

19:33.580 --> 19:34.800
[Callum] Yeah, maybe
you'll sell to me.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.210
Well.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.760
Callum, buddy--

19:41.430 --> 19:42.300
Arrgh!

19:46.140 --> 19:47.140
Wait, guys, that's
Leslie right there.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.060
Just shut up. Keep your
eyes open for Ian.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.480
Francis, I don't think you've
thought this through.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.980
You know, I just want
what's mine.

19:53.020 --> 19:53.940
Get to work.

19:57.570 --> 19:58.440
Hurry up.

20:00.070 --> 20:01.570
That is impressive.

20:01.610 --> 20:02.360
Can you do that
with any old screwdriver?

20:02.410 --> 20:03.740
Or is it like--

20:03.780 --> 20:05.780
Sloan, will you stop
taking notes or I'll skin ya.

20:09.910 --> 20:11.620
[Callum]
Alright big fella, on your feet.

20:12.370 --> 20:13.710
Now.

20:13.750 --> 20:14.670
Where are the supplies?

20:14.710 --> 20:15.630
I don't have anything.

20:15.670 --> 20:16.250
Ow.

20:16.290 --> 20:17.590
Okay, okay.

20:17.630 --> 20:21.090
They're in the trunk of
my car. But be careful.

20:21.130 --> 20:22.090
Don't scratch the--

20:24.640 --> 20:25.760
paint.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.260
[Rose]
You were right, Leslie.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.060
I should have stayed
out of this.

20:33.100 --> 20:33.810
Did you do it?

20:33.850 --> 20:35.350
Yeah, outside's secure.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.730
Rick and Pete are in for a
surprise if they come knocking.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.400
[bang]

20:40.280 --> 20:41.400
[bang]

20:41.440 --> 20:42.450
I though you said you took
their bullets.

20:42.490 --> 20:43.490
Not what they have on them.

20:43.530 --> 20:44.490
[bang]

20:45.450 --> 20:46.450
[bang]

20:46.490 --> 20:47.030
[bang]

20:48.450 --> 20:50.580
Hurry up with that MacGyver
contraption, will you.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.660
[bang]

20:51.700 --> 20:53.040
Alright. Relax.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.420
[bang]

20:58.710 --> 20:59.840
[bang]

21:01.630 --> 21:02.510
[bang]

21:07.350 --> 21:08.510
[bang]

21:13.560 --> 21:14.440
[bang]

21:16.230 --> 21:17.110
[explosion]

21:20.780 --> 21:21.650
[click]

21:27.660 --> 21:28.530
[bang]

21:31.910 --> 21:32.830
Des.

21:32.870 --> 21:33.750
Now.

21:44.380 --> 21:45.550
Now, now, now!

21:45.590 --> 21:46.840
Don't be at it, okay?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.140
I give up! I hate the woods.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.390
I think you're starting

21:51.430 --> 21:52.770
to get a handle
on this outdoor stuff. Down!

21:52.810 --> 21:53.680
[bang]

21:57.310 --> 21:58.190
[explosion]

21:59.940 --> 22:00.980
Knock it off!

22:01.020 --> 22:01.980
You knock it off.

22:02.030 --> 22:02.940
Stop shooting at us.

22:02.980 --> 22:05.400
This is none of your business.

23:23.810 --> 23:25.820
What is it with all this paint?

23:29.320 --> 23:30.570
[Pete]
Cute couple.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.570
Nice frame.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.160
Give me that.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.200
Sorry.

23:39.290 --> 23:40.870
You need to tell us everything

23:40.920 --> 23:41.830
from the beginning.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.290
I don't want any trouble.

23:43.330 --> 23:44.630
[Mal] Tell us what
happened to Sean Barrett.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.090
Or we're sending you back
into the woods.

23:46.130 --> 23:47.800
Mal. What about the coyotes?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.300
They'll eat anything.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.880
I had this friend who came
across one once.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.600
And it just gnawed his face off.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.180
His face off?

23:55.220 --> 23:56.140
His face?

23:56.180 --> 23:57.100
[Des]
Oh yeah.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.020
Gone.

23:58.060 --> 23:58.980
I'm sure you'll be fine.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.230
I didn't pull the trigger.

24:00.270 --> 24:01.310
[Veronica]
Yeah, But you were out there.

24:01.350 --> 24:02.940
You just let
the other guy shoot him?

24:02.980 --> 24:04.560
I didn't want to come on this
stupid trip in the first place.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.730
It was Rick's idea.

24:07.110 --> 24:09.030
He said that we were
going to retrieve a package

24:09.070 --> 24:11.200
some low level courier stole.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.490
Barrett was a courier?

24:12.530 --> 24:14.200
Rick was supposed to show
me the ropes.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.950
I'd been bugging him
for a few months to

24:15.990 --> 24:17.040
let me join the
family business.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.790
The family business?

24:18.830 --> 24:21.000
Yeah. Maybe you heard of them?
The Besson family?

24:21.040 --> 24:25.540
As in Andre Besson?
The head of the Montreal Mob?

24:25.590 --> 24:26.960
You work for the Mob?

24:27.000 --> 24:27.920
Cool.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.130
You work for the mob?

24:31.300 --> 24:32.630
I mean, that is not cool.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.640
There is nothing cool
about working

24:34.680 --> 24:35.760
for the mob.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.680
Please don't murder us.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.020
What do we got here?

25:24.770 --> 25:25.810
What was in the package?

25:25.850 --> 25:26.980
[Pete] I told you. I
don't know, okay?

25:27.020 --> 25:28.730
Rick wasn't exactly
the sharing type.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.320
So when you found Barrett,
you just killed him.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.280
[Mal]
Let me guess.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.190
It was
an accident.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.530
Things got heated.

25:33.570 --> 25:34.990
[Pete] We were supposed to
get the package first.

25:35.030 --> 25:37.030
I didn't even know about the
killing part of the plan.

25:37.070 --> 25:37.990
[Veronica]
You didn't know the

25:38.030 --> 25:39.580
Mob murders people.

25:40.660 --> 25:43.040
I knew Rick was an
enforcer, okay?

25:43.080 --> 25:45.870
I thought I would do stuff
with the books, you know?

25:45.920 --> 25:47.460
Play to my strengths.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.130
And you're sure Rick never told
you what was in the package?

25:51.130 --> 25:52.130
Dad.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.340
A million dollars
in bearer bonds.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.590
Where did you find those?

25:56.630 --> 25:58.470
There was a bunch of orange
paint on trees.

25:58.510 --> 25:59.930
At first I thought they were
marked to be cut down.

25:59.970 --> 26:01.310
Then I realized,

26:01.350 --> 26:03.430
Barret left a trail
leading directly to the bonds.

26:04.270 --> 26:05.560
We need to find that body.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.060
And we need to stop Rick.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.520
Hey. What did you do
with Barrett?

26:08.560 --> 26:09.360
Well, Rick told me to bury him.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.770
But I couldn't go
through with it.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.860
Show us where you left him.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.360
Now.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.070
Des.

26:23.740 --> 26:25.410
[Mal] You notice Des
is a little off?

26:25.450 --> 26:27.250
[Jake] You'll have to
be more specific.

26:27.290 --> 26:28.920
Well, he was going on earlier

26:28.960 --> 26:31.000
about spreading his wings
and flying.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.170
I think he wants to move
out or something.

26:33.210 --> 26:34.510
He can always move in with me.

26:34.550 --> 26:35.420
Because God knows
it looks like I'm gonna

26:35.460 --> 26:36.550
be alone
for the rest of my life.

26:36.590 --> 26:38.840
I thought that for a long
time too, son.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.930
When I lost your mother,
I thought that was it for me.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.560
Then, Rose came along.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.730
So, you saying there's
hope for me yet.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.860
Hope, yes.
Common sense, no.

26:51.900 --> 26:52.770
I got news for you.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.940
I though it was out here,

26:53.980 --> 26:54.730
but all these trees
look the same to me.

26:55.610 --> 26:57.740
Oh, great.
So we're lost.

26:57.780 --> 26:58.950
B'ys.

26:58.990 --> 27:00.320
What is this?

27:06.620 --> 27:08.460
What are we gonna do when
Jake finds the body?

27:08.500 --> 27:09.210
We need to find a way
out of here.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.620
Well, Rick and Pete--

27:10.670 --> 27:11.960
They probably stashed Mal's
truck somewhere, Right?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.380
So, maybe,
I don't know.

27:13.420 --> 27:15.340
Maybe Pete
will help us find it.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.300
Des.
We can't just

27:16.340 --> 27:17.260
sit around.
We have to

27:17.300 --> 27:19.220
do something. Look--

27:19.260 --> 27:21.010
I saw an SUV back
at the trailer.

27:21.050 --> 27:22.760
No, all the wires are pulled
out. I doubt it works.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.720
I can fix that.

27:24.850 --> 27:26.270
I don't know. Look.
I don't know.

27:26.310 --> 27:27.180
Jake said we
should wait here.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.020
Do you always do what
you're told?

27:33.110 --> 27:33.690
Fine. Fine.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.980
Okay. But let me hide
the bonds first.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.030
Bring them with us.

27:37.070 --> 27:38.490
It'll be safer that way.

27:38.530 --> 27:40.320
Come on. It'll only
take a minute.

27:42.820 --> 27:43.910
[Pete]
Oh, this is it.

27:43.950 --> 27:45.740
This must be the place
I left Barrett.

27:49.910 --> 27:52.920
Uh, that's not Barrett.

27:53.750 --> 27:54.880
Rick?

27:56.420 --> 27:58.380
Who else is out here?

28:05.550 --> 28:06.560
[Francis]
Yeah. We're lost.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.930
I'm getting you to the ferry.

28:08.970 --> 28:10.680
You know, maybe this is
where we part ways.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.730
No, no, no.
Wait, wait.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.310
Just hear me out.
Okay.

28:13.350 --> 28:14.610
Look. I'm not Rose.
Okay.

28:14.650 --> 28:15.520
I don't take in every bird
with a broken wing.

28:16.860 --> 28:19.740
I'm not like Rose either.
I'm way more like you.

28:19.780 --> 28:22.660
And I'm insanely helpful.
And young.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.700
So?

28:24.740 --> 28:28.240
So. Everybody and
their dog trusts me.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.960
I can get bad things done way
easier than an adult.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.620
Besides.
We're not lost.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.170
We just have to take a left here
and a right here.

28:36.210 --> 28:39.130
And bang.
We're on our way to Argentia.

28:39.170 --> 28:40.460
Hmmm.

28:40.510 --> 28:44.590
Alright. So you can
read a map. That's a start.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.470
Look, if you're going
with me. Just--

28:48.470 --> 28:49.930
I'm nobody's mother, okay?

28:49.970 --> 28:51.560
So don't look to me
for that stuff.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.770
And I'm nobody's daughter.
So there you go.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.490
You okay?

29:04.530 --> 29:05.780
I just found this over
by the trailer.

29:05.820 --> 29:07.830
It's a pretty barbaric way
to keep looters out.

29:07.870 --> 29:09.990
I'm pretty sure
that's a bear trap.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.000
Why would bears wanna
rob a cabin?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.670
That was a joke.

29:15.710 --> 29:16.790
You sure?

29:16.830 --> 29:17.960
Not really.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.260
Are you gonna give me
a hand with this?

29:26.180 --> 29:27.850
Put your finger here.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.310
Tinny.

29:33.350 --> 29:34.390
What?

29:34.440 --> 29:35.350
Her name's Tinny.
I have a girlfriend.

29:35.390 --> 29:36.440
We're super together.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.610
I mean there's nothing official.

29:41.650 --> 29:43.030
But there's an
announcement forthcoming.

29:43.070 --> 29:44.610
Did you hear that?

29:44.650 --> 29:47.610
It's probably just a squirrel.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.330
Alright. All fixed.
Try the key.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.500
[engine starts]

29:55.120 --> 29:56.210
You're amazing.

29:56.250 --> 29:57.250
I know.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.500
Let's have
a drink to celebrate.

30:00.540 --> 30:02.800
Let's see what Rick
and Pete left in the trailer.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.800
[Mal]
Small caliber.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.010
Probably from a hand gun.

30:10.050 --> 30:11.430
There's definitely someone
else out here.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.890
And now they're after
the bonds too.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.520
Well, uh... I held up
my end of the bargain.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.440
So, uh...I'm gonna
head back to the cabin

30:19.480 --> 30:21.400
before the killer
sets his sights on me.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.360
Hey, hey.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.280
Hey. Pally.

30:24.110 --> 30:25.400
You're not going anywhere.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.360
These are fresh tracks.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.910
Headed north.

30:27.950 --> 30:29.530
The killers?

30:29.570 --> 30:30.870
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

30:30.910 --> 30:33.410
I'm not following any new
tracks into anywhere.

30:33.450 --> 30:34.370
Stop talking.

30:34.410 --> 30:35.410
We better track the killer

30:35.450 --> 30:36.870
Before the killer tracks us.

30:36.910 --> 30:38.580
Agreed.

30:38.620 --> 30:39.580
Come on.

30:39.630 --> 30:42.040
Green tea?
Or Lady Rose?

30:42.090 --> 30:44.800
Does it make me seem less
masculine if I say Lady Rose?

30:45.800 --> 30:46.760
She's a lucky girl.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.050
Tinny.

30:49.050 --> 30:50.600
You're a really
cool guy, Des.

30:54.390 --> 30:57.430
Um. So you hitch hiked all
the way here, huh?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.850
Yeah. From Clarenville.

30:59.900 --> 31:00.810
Took a while for
anybody to stop.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.270
Clarenville?

31:02.310 --> 31:03.230
I thought you said

31:03.270 --> 31:04.190
St. John's?

31:04.230 --> 31:07.400
Yeah. That's right.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.530
I was in town
for a little bit.

31:09.570 --> 31:10.490
St. John's.

31:10.530 --> 31:11.820
Then I went
to Clarenville.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.370
That's all.

31:21.790 --> 31:25.130
Well, nothing like a nice cup of
tea out in the woods.

31:25.170 --> 31:26.050
Right?

31:36.180 --> 31:40.600
So. Hear from Jake or Malachy?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.980
Have any idea when they might
be coming back?

31:48.490 --> 31:49.860
You feeling okay, Des?

31:49.900 --> 31:54.160
Yeah. I just--
I feel really tired.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.490
Are you sure there's
caffeine in there?

31:55.530 --> 31:57.370
Caffeine and...

31:58.160 --> 32:00.120
A little something extra.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.130
Oh, Des. You're so cute
when you..

32:05.800 --> 32:07.880
You're so cu...

32:09.920 --> 32:11.550
What's happening to me?

32:11.590 --> 32:13.300
I'm sorry,
you tried to drug me, so--

32:14.010 --> 32:15.260
I switched our mugs.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.770
Even when you're flirted with
me, I still stayed on my game!

32:19.810 --> 32:21.230
Yeah, you like that?

32:21.270 --> 32:23.900
Ah, come on. No one is around
to see that? My best --

32:23.940 --> 32:25.230
moment.

32:25.270 --> 32:27.150
She... didn't see it really.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.990
[Des] [on walkie] Jake, Mal. Do you copy?

32:30.030 --> 32:30.780
Yeah, yeah.
Des. Are you okay?

32:30.820 --> 32:31.950
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:31.990 --> 32:33.160
Well, I mean,
Veronica tried to drug me.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.490
I had to hide
the bearer bonds.

32:34.530 --> 32:35.700
But other than that,
everything is going to plan.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.080
Why did she try to drug you?

32:38.120 --> 32:40.620
Because she's Barrett's
girlfriend. I found her license.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.960
And she lives at the same
address in Montreal.

32:42.000 --> 32:42.620
I think they came
here together

32:42.670 --> 32:44.000
with the money.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.880
[Jake] Hey, good work, Des.
But be careful, okay.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.880
Whoever shot Barrett, we think
they're still out here.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.050
And they might be looking
for the bonds.

32:49.090 --> 32:50.840
Who else would even know
about the bonds?

32:50.880 --> 32:52.630
Veronica has been with
Des the whole time.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.220
When Rick shot Barrett--

32:58.260 --> 33:00.770
Did you even check to see
if he was really dead?

33:00.810 --> 33:02.180
It happened very fast.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.690
Okay, Rick pulled the trigger.
Barrett went down.

33:03.730 --> 33:04.940
We saw the girl.

33:04.980 --> 33:06.150
Veronica.

33:06.190 --> 33:06.900
You didn't think
to check his pulse?

33:08.110 --> 33:10.570
I'm new to this, okay. No!
I don't know.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.240
Des, be careful.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.570
There's a chance that Barrett

33:13.610 --> 33:15.490
might be out here
and still alive, okay.

33:15.530 --> 33:16.570
We're coming back.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.870
Whoa! Pete.
Stop!

33:17.910 --> 33:18.790
Freeze!

33:20.740 --> 33:22.120
Ah, is this a trap?

33:22.160 --> 33:22.620
No, worse.

33:22.660 --> 33:24.040
Trip wire.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.380
I saw this earlier when I was
looking for the bonds.

33:26.460 --> 33:27.960
And you didn't think
to disarm it?

33:28.000 --> 33:28.960
It's a two man job.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.130
Just--Pete--

33:31.170 --> 33:32.720
Shut up. Don't move.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.630
If you do--

33:37.140 --> 33:38.470
We're all gonna die.

33:44.640 --> 33:44.890
You drugged me.

33:46.310 --> 33:49.110
Oh, now. To be fair.
You tried to drug me first. Now.

33:49.150 --> 33:50.610
Were you just flirting
with me because:

33:50.650 --> 33:52.110
A: You were trying
to distract me.

33:52.150 --> 33:56.110
Or B: Because
you really think I'm cute.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.450
Uhhhh.

33:57.490 --> 33:59.160
No. Obviously, as we know,
I'm taken.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.330
But for my overall confidence,

34:00.370 --> 34:01.490
I'd really like
to know the truth.

34:02.830 --> 34:03.790
So...

34:05.290 --> 34:06.210
[Veronica]
Sean!

34:06.250 --> 34:07.500
Sean!

34:07.540 --> 34:08.750
Baby, you're alive.

34:08.790 --> 34:09.790
Barrett?

34:15.760 --> 34:17.130
Where the hell are my bonds?

34:17.180 --> 34:19.350
So I guess it was A:
a distraction. That's great.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.360
I thought you said you knew
where you were going.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.860
You took two rights.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.320
You were supposed
to take a left and a right.

34:35.780 --> 34:36.650
Really?

34:37.280 --> 34:38.160
[siren]

34:40.160 --> 34:41.030
Rose.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.080
I might have know.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.000
[Leslie]
Put the gun down now.

34:46.330 --> 34:47.870
Francis.
You're not a murderer.

34:47.910 --> 34:49.830
You know, this might be
the day I reconsider.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.250
Listen to me.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.840
Don't take this out on Sloan.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.170
Okay?

34:55.260 --> 34:56.300
It's me you're mad at.

34:57.840 --> 34:58.720
[punch]

34:59.680 --> 35:00.590
Uh!

35:00.640 --> 35:01.510
Oh!

35:04.890 --> 35:07.560
All this trouble for
a teenage brat.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.650
Awww. I though we
had such a connection.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.020
Yeah. You do have a connection.

35:11.060 --> 35:12.610
You're both sleveens.

35:21.820 --> 35:22.990
[Sloan]
Nice.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.250
First I get electrocuted.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.250
Now we're all going
to get blown to bits.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.540
Nature sucks.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.880
This isn't nature.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.630
This is Barrett's way of
protecting his bonds.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.800
Jake. What do you
see down there?

35:39.840 --> 35:42.140
On either side,
there are two contacts.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.100
They need to touch
for the charge

35:43.140 --> 35:44.140
to go off.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.680
So we need to slip
something between

35:45.720 --> 35:47.270
the contacts
to disable it.

35:47.310 --> 35:49.480
Exactly. Like I said,
it's a two man job.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.270
Jake. I don't know
how much longer

35:50.310 --> 35:51.650
I can stand like this.

35:51.690 --> 35:53.810
You're gonna stand there. Okay?
Or we're all dead.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.230
And I don't
want to be dead.

35:55.270 --> 35:57.150
Pete. Hold on.

35:57.190 --> 35:58.110
Now what can we use

35:58.150 --> 35:59.650
to jam the contacts?

36:00.490 --> 36:02.200
Here. Use my credit cards.

36:08.330 --> 36:09.290
Hold on there, Pete.

36:11.790 --> 36:13.210
You know, you're certainly
going through a lot of trouble

36:13.250 --> 36:14.710
to keep my mind off Leslie.

36:14.750 --> 36:17.210
Ah. Nothing like the
possibility of being blown up

36:17.250 --> 36:19.050
to put things in perspective.

36:21.050 --> 36:22.180
[Mal]
Ready?

36:22.220 --> 36:23.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:23.340 --> 36:24.680
Just do it please!

36:25.640 --> 36:26.560
Now.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.510
[Mal]
Pete.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.980
Slowly
lower your foot.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.300
These things were maxed
out anyways.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.010
We should get back
and check on Des.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.680
Come on.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.640
Come on.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.600
No Des.

37:10.640 --> 37:11.520
Looks like there was a struggle.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.060
And I found this.

37:14.770 --> 37:16.610
Barrett was here.

37:16.650 --> 37:18.150
You know, I hate to state
the obvious,

37:18.190 --> 37:18.860
but if Barrett's alive, he's
probably gonna be really pissed.

37:20.070 --> 37:20.980
Once he gets his money,
we're all dead.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.440
Des told us he hid the bonds.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.820
If Barrett showed up,

37:23.860 --> 37:25.700
he likely forced Des
to tell him where he hid them.

37:26.570 --> 37:28.410
I'll go find Des.

37:28.450 --> 37:29.370
You stay here with Pete.

37:29.410 --> 37:30.370
Oh thank God.

37:32.870 --> 37:34.120
Nope.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.710
You're gonna show
me where to find my truck.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.130
Dad--

37:37.170 --> 37:38.090
Maybe Des was paying
attention to me

37:38.130 --> 37:39.000
after all.

37:47.590 --> 37:49.930
Hey, hey. I'm just having
trouble reading my own writing.

37:49.970 --> 37:52.810
It's either fifty paces south,
or thirty paces east.

37:54.390 --> 37:55.980
You're writing's
terrible, kid.

37:56.020 --> 37:57.060
Yeah,
sorry about that.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.810
Ow. Ow!

37:58.860 --> 37:59.610
You know, I think it's this way.

37:59.650 --> 38:01.150
It better be.

38:01.190 --> 38:02.440
I have a feeling you've been
leading us around in circles.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.900
He drugged me,
you know.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.700
Not for sex stuff.
What are you..?

38:06.740 --> 38:08.570
You have two minutes
to get me my bonds.

38:08.610 --> 38:10.160
Or you're gonna start
walking with a permanent limp.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.540
Okay. This is the spot.
This is where I hid the bonds.

38:16.290 --> 38:17.210
It's right here.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.330
Who the hell are you?

38:18.380 --> 38:19.290
That's Jake.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.210
Hey Jake.

38:21.380 --> 38:22.170
Okay.

38:22.880 --> 38:23.840
Just send Des over.

38:23.880 --> 38:24.920
You can have
your money

38:24.970 --> 38:26.010
I don't even care
where it came from.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.090
[Veronica]
It was the Mob's money.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.550
And now it's ours.

38:28.590 --> 38:29.930
Besson owed me.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.430
Alright?

38:31.470 --> 38:32.720
He kept promising to move me up.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.390
But he didn't
because I'm not family.

38:34.430 --> 38:35.350
[Jake]
Like I said,

38:35.390 --> 38:36.310
I don't care.

38:36.350 --> 38:37.270
So...

38:37.310 --> 38:38.230
There's the money.

38:38.270 --> 38:39.190
Come get it.

38:39.230 --> 38:40.610
And give me Des.

38:40.650 --> 38:41.730
[Barrett] I wish it
was that simple.

38:41.770 --> 38:43.440
But we can't leave
any witnesses.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.820
Arrgh!

38:51.830 --> 38:53.950
Jake! The bonds.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.290
I don't know about this.

39:00.330 --> 39:01.750
Just keep your eye on the road.

39:02.630 --> 39:03.880
Look alive.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.510
There she is.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.220
Des.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.550
[Des] I don't know.
There's like a

39:09.590 --> 39:10.510
fifty percent chance
this is actually gonna work.

39:10.550 --> 39:12.140
Just have it ready.

39:12.180 --> 39:14.390
You must really love
Barrett, if you just let him

39:14.430 --> 39:15.350
lie there with that

39:15.390 --> 39:16.890
bear trap on
his foot.

39:17.810 --> 39:19.270
Get out of my way.

39:19.310 --> 39:21.730
Sorry. I can't let you leave
with those bonds.

39:24.150 --> 39:25.530
[Veronica]
Well, that's cute.

39:25.570 --> 39:27.190
What are you
gonna do? Flare me to death?

39:27.240 --> 39:28.240
I'm sorry.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.030
Again?

39:34.830 --> 39:36.370
Nice shot, son.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.000
[Pete]
Hey, so--

39:42.040 --> 39:43.750
What happens
to those bonds?

39:43.790 --> 39:44.800
Property of the cops.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.510
As soon as we get
a cell phone signal.

39:49.670 --> 39:50.880
Shouldn't be long now.

39:50.930 --> 39:51.430
We'll be back in St. John's
in a few hours.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.470
Did you guys manage
to catch anything?

39:54.510 --> 39:55.430
Oh.

39:55.470 --> 39:56.810
A couple of small ones.

39:58.850 --> 40:00.640
Hey. Have you and Sloan
stayed out of trouble?

40:00.690 --> 40:01.850
For the most part.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.610
That was a nice play.

40:04.650 --> 40:06.280
Getting me on to your
side like that.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.230
I bought it.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.190
You're good.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.110
I told you.
People trust me.

40:10.150 --> 40:13.320
Yeah. Well. That's one thing
about the scamming business--

40:14.530 --> 40:16.410
Cockiness
brings trouble.

40:16.450 --> 40:18.040
And that one over there?

40:18.080 --> 40:20.710
Rose Doyle. She can spot
a grift a mile away.

40:21.870 --> 40:24.000
I don't know what your play is.
But--

40:24.040 --> 40:27.380
If I were you...
I'd watch myself.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.760
What are you two talking about?

40:34.800 --> 40:36.100
I have no idea.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.180
Yeah. No it's been great.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.310
I actually caught more fish than
Jake and Mal combined.

40:41.350 --> 40:42.640
[Tinny] Hey, you didn't...

40:42.690 --> 40:44.900
tell Poppy and Uncle Jake
anything about us, right?

40:44.940 --> 40:46.440
Oh, no. no. Never.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.150
I promise we will tell them.

40:49.190 --> 40:52.490
I just wanna figure out what's
going on between us first.

40:52.530 --> 40:53.450
Okay great.

40:53.490 --> 40:54.660
Yeah. I'll see you later. Bye.

40:54.700 --> 40:56.070
You know, I was thinking.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.990
We should be doing trips just
like this more often.

40:58.030 --> 40:59.620
Except less running
and shooting.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.910
Or no shooting at all, ever.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.460
We will.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.540
Hey, what was that you were
trying to tell me earlier about.

41:04.580 --> 41:06.080
Some big announcement?

41:06.130 --> 41:07.380
Spreading your wings?

41:08.920 --> 41:10.760
You can tell Dad, b'y.
He's not that sensitive.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.380
You do know that they'll always
be a place for you at the house.

41:13.430 --> 41:14.890
You're family.

41:14.930 --> 41:15.840
I'm moving out?

41:15.890 --> 41:17.010
Right.

41:18.180 --> 41:19.890
Right. Yes.
I'm moving out.

41:19.930 --> 41:20.720
You know,
I gotta

41:21.520 --> 41:22.680
spread my wings. I'm...

41:22.730 --> 41:25.730
Jumping the nest.
When doves cry.

41:27.900 --> 41:28.900
What?

41:28.940 --> 41:31.240
Nothing.
I gotta make a call.

41:34.200 --> 41:38.410
You know, this wasn't exactly
the trip I had planned.

41:38.450 --> 41:39.540
You okay?

41:42.200 --> 41:42.580
I'm fine.

41:43.870 --> 41:46.330
Leslie's made her choice.
She's with, Callum.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.420
I gotta live with that.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.930
You got cut good.

41:58.300 --> 42:01.560
Oooh. It was worth it for this.

42:05.140 --> 42:06.150
Hey. I never thanked you.

42:07.770 --> 42:10.150
You didn't have to help. And you
did. I really appreciate that.

42:11.110 --> 42:12.820
It wasn't a problem, really.

42:13.690 --> 42:15.450
You mean a lot to me.

42:16.990 --> 42:18.910
And I'm always gonna be here--

42:18.950 --> 42:20.030
when you need me.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.540
And I don't want you getting
in trouble. Okay?

42:25.040 --> 42:26.330
Or losing your job.

42:27.460 --> 42:28.250
Or go away again?

42:29.630 --> 42:32.550
I'm not the man I used to be
all those years ago.
