00:20.678 --> 00:22.896
What's up, guys?
My name is Teddy.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.506
And I'm Claire.

00:24.508 --> 00:27.466
And welcome to another
episode of "Superhost."

00:27.468 --> 00:29.294
Don't forget to smash
that "like" button

00:29.296 --> 00:31.948
- and click that little bell...
- So you never miss an episode.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.863
And this week, we are
staying at a gorgeous house

00:33.865 --> 00:35.343
up in the mountains.

00:35.345 --> 00:36.953
We have been trying
to get it for months,

00:36.955 --> 00:38.694
and it has been booked solid!

00:38.696 --> 00:40.783
This superhost,
username BettyLou52,

00:40.785 --> 00:43.264
- has a nearly spotless record.
- Mm-hmm.

00:43.266 --> 00:45.136
Endless reviews
saying how staying here

00:45.138 --> 00:46.572
has been "breathtaking."

00:46.574 --> 00:48.182
"Breathtaking.
"Absolutely marvelous."

00:48.184 --> 00:50.489
One user even described it
as "life-changing."

00:50.491 --> 00:52.143
"Life-changing."

00:52.145 --> 00:54.188
Are you ready
to change your life?

00:54.190 --> 00:56.147
But if you missed
our last series,

00:56.149 --> 00:58.236
- you should click right here.
- They finally had an opening,

00:58.238 --> 01:00.977
- so I am really excited.
- Me too!

01:00.979 --> 01:02.979
It is gonna be
such a memorable stay,

01:02.981 --> 01:04.763
and we are checking in...

01:04.766 --> 01:06.246
Right now.

01:09.162 --> 01:10.639
Okay. Cut.

01:10.641 --> 01:13.903
- Ah. I think that worked.
- Yeah, it was fine.

01:13.905 --> 01:16.079
We can just throw in some
reactions over the boring parts.

01:16.081 --> 01:17.951
Yeah.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.692
Hey, can you order a hard drive
to the house?

01:19.694 --> 01:21.041
Yeah, I can.

01:21.043 --> 01:22.434
I think I'm gonna shower
before we go.

01:22.436 --> 01:24.262
- Sounds good.
- Hey.

01:24.264 --> 01:27.003
- You want to join me?
- Really?

01:27.005 --> 01:29.225
Nah.

01:35.405 --> 01:37.190
Hey, babe!

01:43.457 --> 01:45.065
What's up, guys?

01:45.067 --> 01:47.809
Okay. This week's episode
is gonna be a special one.

01:50.246 --> 01:52.681
Finally gonna pop the question.

01:52.683 --> 01:55.206
She has no idea,
but this week's episode

01:55.208 --> 01:57.164
is gonna be one
she won't ever forget.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.035
I'm gonna do my best
to keep you all in the loop

01:59.037 --> 02:00.515
this entire time.

02:00.517 --> 02:03.736
I'm so nervous.

02:03.738 --> 02:06.521
Don't forget
to like and subscribe.

03:07.802 --> 03:10.106
So quiet here.

03:10.108 --> 03:12.021
Okay. First impressions.

03:12.023 --> 03:15.155
Babe, give me a heads-up.
Still got road hair.

03:15.157 --> 03:17.462
Come on. Think fast.
First impressions.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.986
Okay.
Wah!

03:19.988 --> 03:22.075
Come on, DiCaprio.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.905
Okay. Uh, my first impressions
of this place is just the...

03:25.907 --> 03:28.603
Okay. Cut the shit.

03:28.605 --> 03:29.909
What?

03:29.911 --> 03:32.303
That felt fake. Do it over.

03:32.305 --> 03:33.915
Okay. Fine.

03:35.612 --> 03:38.874
Okay.

03:38.876 --> 03:41.268
Do you want to start off
with the shot of the house?

03:41.270 --> 03:44.315
Mm-hmm. Got it.

03:44.317 --> 03:46.012
What are you doing?

03:46.014 --> 03:48.754
Holy crap! This is insane!

03:48.756 --> 03:54.063
Oh, my G-o-o-o-od!

03:54.065 --> 03:55.717
You're the worst.

03:55.719 --> 03:57.328
And scene.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.813
This is why
we're losing subscribers.

04:04.815 --> 04:06.424
Ouch.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.958
Got a pretty good feeling
about this video.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.526
Mm-hmm.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.310
Could be on a hot streak
again soon.

04:23.312 --> 04:25.704
Whew. Let's hope so.

04:25.706 --> 04:27.445
Place looks so nice.

04:27.447 --> 04:29.751
All right.

04:29.753 --> 04:31.579
2-3-4-2.

04:35.672 --> 04:37.585
...4-2.

04:37.587 --> 04:39.195
Shit.

04:39.197 --> 04:40.588
- Not working?
- No.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.591
Here.

04:43.593 --> 04:45.811
"First arrive..."
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

04:45.813 --> 04:49.597
Front-door code... 2-3-4-2.

04:49.599 --> 04:52.165
- Yeah, I tried that.
- Well, shit.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.472
- That's what I said.
- Do you have the host's number?

04:54.474 --> 04:56.474
- Can you call them?
- Yeah, it's in our messages,

04:56.476 --> 04:58.432
but it's not loading.

04:58.434 --> 05:00.173
- No. Look. It's right here.
- Oh.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.349
Let me get a better signal.

05:24.982 --> 05:27.548
It's ringing!

05:29.030 --> 05:30.899
It's ringing.

05:39.344 --> 05:41.434
It's not ringing anymore!

05:46.134 --> 05:50.441
- Here we go. Second impressions.
- Second impressions. Yeah.

05:50.443 --> 05:54.357
Well, the outside is terrific,

05:54.359 --> 05:57.143
but we got the wrong door code,
so I don't know if we'll ever

05:57.145 --> 05:59.885
see the inside.

05:59.887 --> 06:03.105
Good energy, but just give me
something we can use.

06:03.107 --> 06:05.891
Yeah. Uh...

06:05.893 --> 06:08.720
Okay. Got something.

06:08.722 --> 06:11.028
My second impressions.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.204
What?

06:15.206 --> 06:16.858
Teddy, what?

06:16.860 --> 06:19.297
Hi, there!

06:21.822 --> 06:23.212
Thanks for the warning.

06:23.214 --> 06:25.432
You must be BettyLou52.

06:25.434 --> 06:27.303
It's actually Rebecca.

06:27.305 --> 06:29.871
Oh, so you're neither
Betty nor Lou.

06:29.873 --> 06:32.439
- I'm Claire.
- Yeah!

06:32.441 --> 06:34.528
I never know what to use
on those sites, you know?

06:34.530 --> 06:36.356
Do I use my real name
and invite strangers

06:36.358 --> 06:39.230
to know too much about me
or do I use something random?

06:40.667 --> 06:44.407
- Uh, we tried calling.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

06:44.409 --> 06:47.628
The service out here
is spotty.

06:47.630 --> 06:49.804
I got a notification
on the camera,

06:49.806 --> 06:51.895
saw you guys sitting out here.

06:55.029 --> 06:57.333
Yeah, well, the door code
didn't work, so...

06:57.335 --> 06:59.510
Oh, pbht! I totally forgot!

06:59.512 --> 07:01.686
I had to change it
after the last guests

07:01.688 --> 07:03.688
tried to stay longer
than they were supposed to.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.299
Right.
I mean, who can blame them?

07:09.522 --> 07:11.652
Ahh!

07:11.654 --> 07:15.264
Anyway, I can let you guys in,
give you a new code.

07:15.266 --> 07:17.530
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Sure.

07:21.011 --> 07:23.318
Oh. Thank you.

07:35.504 --> 07:39.114
I'm sorry again about the code.

07:39.116 --> 07:42.814
I don't normally
have to change it after people.

07:42.816 --> 07:44.642
Thanks for understanding.

07:44.644 --> 07:46.687
Those last guests,
let me tell you.

07:46.689 --> 07:49.734
New code is 8-5-8-7.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.607
8-5-8-7.

07:52.956 --> 07:54.915
Thanks.

08:14.282 --> 08:15.716
Wow.

08:15.718 --> 08:17.457
Ditto.

08:17.459 --> 08:19.851
The alarm code
is the same as the front door.

08:19.853 --> 08:22.331
- Do you need me to write it down?
- 8-5-8-7. Got it.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.377
- Restroom?
- Down there to the right.

08:24.379 --> 08:29.121
Oh, my God. We are here.
And it is gorgeous.

08:29.123 --> 08:31.166
Say hello to the superhost.

08:31.168 --> 08:32.735
No!

08:34.736 --> 08:36.823
Um...

08:36.826 --> 08:41.220
I-I had messaged you when
we booked about what we do.

08:41.222 --> 08:43.135
We do that travel vlog
called "Superhost"

08:43.136 --> 08:45.441
where we stay at and review
vacation rentals.

08:45.443 --> 08:48.488
Ohh! Pbht! Of course!

08:48.490 --> 08:50.708
Sorry.
It's been such a busy season.

08:50.710 --> 08:52.318
I thought you were next week.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.712
I-If you don't mind,
of course.

08:54.714 --> 08:56.888
We've never had any problems
with it before, so...

08:56.890 --> 09:00.892
No. No, it's fine.
It's fine. Yeah.

09:00.894 --> 09:03.982
And you're still okay
with being on camera for it?

09:03.984 --> 09:05.505
Yeah!

09:05.507 --> 09:07.942
For sure. Whatever you need.

09:07.944 --> 09:12.294
I just want to make sure
this trip is unforgettable.

09:12.296 --> 09:16.385
Hey, so, the, uh, toilet
over there isn't flushing.

09:16.387 --> 09:19.475
Oh. That's weird.

09:19.477 --> 09:22.087
Um, I am really sorry.

09:22.089 --> 09:24.306
I can come back later
with some tools.

09:24.308 --> 09:27.309
- I don't have anything on me.
- Oh. Yeah. That's totally fine.

09:27.311 --> 09:29.529
I'm just glad
it was just a number one.

09:35.102 --> 09:38.233
Hmm. Well, I don't want to
get in the way of your trip.

09:38.235 --> 09:42.194
Wouldn't want
to get a bad review!

09:42.196 --> 09:45.110
I'll come back tomorrow
to fix the toilet.

09:45.112 --> 09:48.461
If there is anything
you need before then,

09:48.463 --> 09:50.245
shoot me a text.

09:50.247 --> 09:52.423
Will do.

09:59.779 --> 10:02.433
She sure is something.

10:06.263 --> 10:08.307
What's up, guys?!
We finally settled in,

10:08.309 --> 10:11.223
and we want to give you
a quick tour around this place.

10:11.225 --> 10:12.833
This room is beautiful.

10:12.835 --> 10:15.053
It was featured the most
on the site for good reason.

10:15.055 --> 10:17.533
Look how big these windows are!

10:19.015 --> 10:20.754
And welcome
to the very rustic kitchen.

10:20.756 --> 10:24.105
- Check out this little number.
- An authentic cabin stove!

10:24.107 --> 10:26.064
Looks a bit like
a "Hansel and Gretel" situation.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.718
Like, maybe you could
fit in there, Teddy.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.589
I would cook me in here.

10:29.591 --> 10:31.547
- Oh, it's very filthy, though.
- Yes, it is.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.593
And here we have
the master bedroom.

10:33.595 --> 10:36.509
With exactly
zero window covering!

10:36.511 --> 10:38.772
Seems like we'll be getting up
very early in the morning,

10:38.774 --> 10:40.774
which I love, as you guys know.

10:40.776 --> 10:42.645
Ooh. How is it?

10:42.647 --> 10:44.343
- Very soft.
- Great.

10:44.345 --> 10:47.694
And what vacation rental
would be complete without...

10:47.696 --> 10:49.261
- one of these?
- Ooh!

10:49.263 --> 10:51.089
- I gotta see it.
- No, Teddy.

10:51.091 --> 10:53.134
I have to!
Tell my parents I love them!

10:53.136 --> 10:55.397
- No, Teddy! No!
- Okay.

10:55.399 --> 10:56.659
It was close.

10:56.661 --> 10:58.533
So, one thing we noticed.

11:00.143 --> 11:02.796
- Security cameras everywhere.
- I mean, places like this

11:02.798 --> 11:04.798
usually have
a security camera or two,

11:04.800 --> 11:07.932
but it just seems
a little bit overboard here.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.456
Another one.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.197
Another one there.

11:12.199 --> 11:14.112
And what do we have here,
Teddy?

11:14.114 --> 11:16.114
We have my favorite room
in the house.

11:16.116 --> 11:20.683
A cat room! With everything
that you need as a cat!

11:20.685 --> 11:22.511
He's so strange.

11:22.513 --> 11:25.427
But I haven't seen a cat yet.
Have you?

11:28.302 --> 11:29.780
Teddy.

11:29.782 --> 11:33.479
- What?
- You like cats.

11:33.481 --> 11:36.221
Okay. Apart from that,
what do you think?

11:36.223 --> 11:38.179
It feels slow.

11:38.181 --> 11:41.966
- Really? W-Which part?
- Every part.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.448
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

11:47.364 --> 11:48.886
Babe.

11:48.888 --> 11:51.758
Just lose the cat-room bit
and upload it.

12:17.046 --> 12:20.221
It's uploading.

12:20.223 --> 12:23.442
And the Internet is very slow.

12:23.444 --> 12:25.315
Mm-hmm.

12:35.151 --> 12:38.239
Hey, I know how hard you've
been working on this channel.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.504
But we're gonna have
a great series here.

12:42.506 --> 12:45.986
- I know it.
- Our numbers are dropping.

12:45.988 --> 12:49.555
What if we've peaked?
And that's it?

12:49.557 --> 12:51.818
Then...

12:51.820 --> 12:54.214
at least we've peaked together.

12:59.915 --> 13:03.047
Yeah.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.309
You're so corny.

13:04.311 --> 13:06.267
I know.

15:08.652 --> 15:10.826
- Hey.
- Jesus.

15:10.828 --> 15:13.742
Babe. What are you doing,
sneaking up on me like that?

15:13.744 --> 15:15.831
I called your name
from the stairs.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.443
What are you doing?

15:18.445 --> 15:21.837
I thought I saw something
out there.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.536
What? Where?

15:24.538 --> 15:27.495
Out there.

15:27.497 --> 15:29.847
It looked like
they were staring back at me.

15:32.981 --> 15:36.852
Maybe you just saw an animal
or something.

15:36.854 --> 15:40.247
Teddy, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Let's go back to bed.

15:40.249 --> 15:42.206
We have a lot to do tomorrow.

15:59.007 --> 16:01.834
What's up, guys?
Day two of our trip here!

16:01.836 --> 16:03.749
Claire is still sleeping.
Let's go say hi.

16:03.751 --> 16:05.707
Good morning, sunshine.

16:05.709 --> 16:07.448
No. Good night.

16:07.450 --> 16:10.060
Aww. We've missed you.
I've missed you.

16:10.062 --> 16:11.887
No, you haven't.

16:11.889 --> 16:13.585
We had a bit of a late night,

16:13.587 --> 16:16.936
but we're ready
for day-two adventures!

16:16.938 --> 16:18.938
So don't forget
to smash that "like" button

16:18.940 --> 16:20.853
and subscribe to our videos.
Anything to add, Claire?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.681
Why is it so bright in here?!

16:24.685 --> 16:27.862
- Too early, dude.
- I know.

16:32.954 --> 16:34.736
Shit.

16:34.738 --> 16:36.869
- What?
- Shit!

16:36.871 --> 16:39.003
- What?
- Check your phone.

16:42.050 --> 16:44.659
Wait. How did this happen?

16:44.661 --> 16:46.748
I bet it was
"That Bitch in Draper."

16:46.750 --> 16:49.316
I mean, it could have been
a bot auto-flagging

16:49.318 --> 16:50.926
or something.
We... We can dispute it.

16:50.928 --> 16:54.452
- It's not a mistake!
- Does it say which video?

16:54.454 --> 16:57.542
The whole channel's down.

16:57.544 --> 16:59.500
Of course. No service.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.032
Gotcha.

17:12.646 --> 17:14.428
Hello. You've reached

17:14.430 --> 17:16.473
the Partnership Program
support line.

17:16.476 --> 17:18.432
Please wait while we

17:18.434 --> 17:20.434
connect you
to the next available agent.

17:20.435 --> 17:22.871
Hi! How ya doin'?

17:22.873 --> 17:25.569
Hey! Yeah, I-I'm good.

17:25.571 --> 17:28.355
Just here to fix the toilet.

17:28.357 --> 17:30.749
Oh. Oh, thanks. Thank you.

17:30.751 --> 17:33.360
Is the place treating you well,
like, outside of that?

17:33.362 --> 17:36.929
I would really... hate
to get a bad review.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.714
Oh. Yeah, yeah. It's great.

17:39.716 --> 17:41.934
I'm actually just
trying to make a call,

17:41.936 --> 17:43.327
but Teddy's upstairs.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.114
Perfect.
I'll check it out.

17:47.637 --> 17:49.594
Okay.

17:51.728 --> 17:53.815
Hello. My name is Brad,
and thanks for holding.

17:53.817 --> 17:57.167
Can I get your
account number, please?

17:57.169 --> 17:59.038
What's up, guys? Teddy here.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.258
It is day two, and I only
have a couple of minutes,

18:01.260 --> 18:05.523
but I wanted to quickly give you
an update on the proposal.

18:05.525 --> 18:07.873
The current plan is, tomorrow
morning, I'm gonna take her

18:07.875 --> 18:10.267
to this super-pretty spot
that one of our fans sent us...

18:10.269 --> 18:12.007
thank you so much...
and do the deed.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.618
And don't worry...
I'm gonna film

18:13.620 --> 18:15.402
the whole thing secretly
the entire time

18:15.404 --> 18:17.143
so you can all enjoy.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.625
All right. Gotta run. Ciao.

18:23.282 --> 18:26.110
- Hey, Teddy!
- Oh. Hey.

18:31.942 --> 18:34.291
I really should have checked
before I used it.

18:34.293 --> 18:36.031
It happens.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.556
We get issues with the septic
tank from time to time.

18:38.558 --> 18:41.169
Don't have the pressure
you guys have.

18:52.702 --> 18:54.093
It's usually nothing.

18:54.095 --> 18:57.227
But sometimes things
get stuck in here.

18:57.229 --> 18:59.098
It's this low season
right now,

18:59.100 --> 19:01.666
so sometimes these things
don't get used

19:01.668 --> 19:03.494
to keep them
working properly.

19:11.808 --> 19:13.808
Shit.

19:13.810 --> 19:16.376
I'm gonna have to
get somebody out here.

19:16.378 --> 19:19.684
That's fine.
We'll just use the other one.

19:19.686 --> 19:23.775
I really hope this doesn't
affect your review.

19:23.777 --> 19:25.994
Oh, no. Believe me,
this place is great.

19:25.996 --> 19:28.736
You have nothing
to worry about.

19:28.738 --> 19:31.043
Hey.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.784
How did it go?

19:32.786 --> 19:35.003
I spent all that time verifying
the account information,

19:35.005 --> 19:38.529
and then,
I dropped the call.

19:38.531 --> 19:41.532
I kind of like this place
can't win right now.

19:41.534 --> 19:44.752
No, you have nothing
to do with it.

19:44.754 --> 19:46.145
Are you sure?

20:01.815 --> 20:03.989
If there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate.

20:03.991 --> 20:06.252
And again,
I am so sorry.

20:06.254 --> 20:07.601
Thank you.

20:16.786 --> 20:18.786
So...

20:18.788 --> 20:20.135
what you want
to do now?

20:34.717 --> 20:36.284
What are we doing
up here?

20:39.418 --> 20:41.679
We make these stupid videos that
nobody's even watching anymore.

20:41.681 --> 20:44.943
- People are watching.
- We're bleeding subscribers.

20:44.945 --> 20:47.728
What's the point?

20:47.730 --> 20:51.819
I... like making these
with you.

20:51.821 --> 20:54.474
Do you like asking your parents
for help to pay rent?

20:54.476 --> 20:57.869
- They don't mind.
- That's not the point.

20:57.871 --> 21:00.480
We used to be able to...

21:00.482 --> 21:01.962
pay our own bills.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.486
We've gotten away from
what worked for us.

21:06.488 --> 21:08.706
"The Bitch from Draper"
was massive.

21:08.708 --> 21:11.970
Yeah, but that was so
clickbait-y.

21:11.972 --> 21:14.322
- No one likes that.
- It got eyeballs.

21:19.109 --> 21:20.372
I guess.

21:27.770 --> 21:29.076
We should get back.

21:41.610 --> 21:43.741
What?

21:43.743 --> 21:45.395
Teddy, what?

21:45.397 --> 21:46.876
Hi, there.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.229
My second impression.

21:54.275 --> 21:56.318
What?

21:56.320 --> 21:57.583
Teddy, what?

22:00.194 --> 22:03.891
My second impression.

22:03.893 --> 22:06.067
What?

22:06.069 --> 22:07.765
Teddy, what?

22:10.683 --> 22:12.206
My second impression.

22:14.513 --> 22:15.992
Hey, I'm gonna
head up.

22:16.993 --> 22:18.340
Okay.

22:18.342 --> 22:19.692
I'll be up
in a minute.

22:22.085 --> 22:23.345
Okay.

22:30.006 --> 22:31.266
Teddy, what?

23:04.867 --> 23:07.085
Did you hear that?

23:07.087 --> 23:08.828
- What time is it?
- Shh.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.830
There's nothing.

23:12.832 --> 23:15.920
Just go back to sleep.

23:21.623 --> 23:24.406
Someone's inside
the house.

23:24.408 --> 23:25.712
What do you mean
someone's ins...

23:30.023 --> 23:31.936
What do we do?

23:31.938 --> 23:34.939
I don't know.

23:34.941 --> 23:36.508
What if it's Rebecca?

23:38.684 --> 23:40.163
What if it's not?

23:42.470 --> 23:43.906
I'm calling
the police.

23:46.518 --> 23:49.519
Shit. No service.

23:55.048 --> 23:56.961
Did you set the alarm?

23:56.963 --> 24:00.225
Yeah.

24:00.227 --> 24:01.879
Go check.

24:01.881 --> 24:03.663
What?

24:03.665 --> 24:06.187
Just go make sure.

24:06.189 --> 24:07.626
Are you serious?

24:46.316 --> 24:47.709
Check the living room.

25:15.998 --> 25:17.478
Hello?

25:59.651 --> 26:01.259
Hello?

27:13.202 --> 27:15.333
Well?

27:15.335 --> 27:18.858
Toilet's fixed.

28:01.816 --> 28:03.773
- Good morning.
- Jesus!

28:03.775 --> 28:08.647
Sorry. I was hoping to be done
before you got up.

28:08.649 --> 28:11.171
I know. I know.

28:11.173 --> 28:13.608
I just couldn't sleep
last night,

28:13.610 --> 28:15.088
because I kept
thinking about

28:15.090 --> 28:16.960
how things kept going wrong
for you guys,

28:16.962 --> 28:18.700
and I didn't want another day
to get off on the wrong foot.

28:18.702 --> 28:20.485
So, I stopped
at the store,

28:20.487 --> 28:22.443
and I ended up getting
a few other things,

28:22.445 --> 28:24.184
and then one thing
led to another.

28:24.186 --> 28:27.753
- Yeah, I...
- I totally get it.

28:27.755 --> 28:30.756
I'm just about done, and then,
I'll be out of your hair.

28:30.758 --> 28:32.932
Won't happen again.

28:32.934 --> 28:34.283
Okay.

28:38.548 --> 28:40.115
Coffee's almost ready.

28:51.648 --> 28:52.911
What's up?

28:57.306 --> 28:59.221
Rebecca made us breakfast.

29:04.444 --> 29:06.574
What did she make?

29:06.576 --> 29:08.315
How do you not smell
the food.

29:08.317 --> 29:10.404
You don't go
downstairs thinking

29:10.406 --> 29:11.884
that you're gonn...
you know, someone's gonna...

29:11.886 --> 29:13.103
I don't know.
I thought it was a candle.

29:13.105 --> 29:15.801
When did she come in?

29:15.803 --> 29:18.238
I don't...
I don't know.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.371
I just came down,
half naked.

29:22.549 --> 29:24.114
It was humiliating.

29:24.116 --> 29:25.855
I'm just glad I was wearing
underwear.

29:25.857 --> 29:27.204
It's amazing.

29:27.206 --> 29:29.989
No, it was terrible,
it what that was.

29:29.991 --> 29:32.078
Well, even though
she gave you a fright,

29:32.080 --> 29:35.516
she made us some damn
good pancakes.

29:35.518 --> 29:36.822
Yeah.

29:36.824 --> 29:38.782
Hey, thanks for breakfast.

29:42.612 --> 29:44.353
You are so welcome.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.851
Okay, I am.

30:05.853 --> 30:08.941
Okay, so,
not gonna lie,

30:08.943 --> 30:11.465
so far, this trip has been
pretty interesting.

30:11.467 --> 30:12.989
It's been a doozy.

30:12.991 --> 30:15.469
First of all, our channel
got demonetized...

30:15.471 --> 30:17.036
- By accident. Not our fault.
- Right.

30:17.038 --> 30:18.646
But then, you think
you come out this far

30:18.648 --> 30:20.997
to get away from
all those crazy people,

30:20.999 --> 30:22.781
but then, you get
to this house,

30:22.783 --> 30:25.827
and you realize that the host
might actually be crazier

30:25.829 --> 30:28.656
than the people
you were escaping in the f...

30:28.658 --> 30:29.919
- What?
- I mean,

30:29.921 --> 30:32.312
we shouldn't talk
about the...

30:32.314 --> 30:35.707
What do you mean?

30:35.709 --> 30:37.189
I think she can hear us.

30:42.063 --> 30:43.543
Can't we just turn it off?

30:45.719 --> 30:47.153
Probably.

30:47.155 --> 30:50.374
But let's just film
someplace else.

30:50.376 --> 30:52.073
This room looks the best.

30:53.770 --> 30:57.424
Yeah, it does.

30:57.426 --> 30:59.165
Okay. Let me...

30:59.167 --> 31:00.645
- find a ladder.
- Okay.

31:00.647 --> 31:01.953
I'm gonna cut.

31:09.090 --> 31:10.396
Careful.

31:32.940 --> 31:34.548
It was you.

31:34.550 --> 31:36.028
You reported us,
didn't you?

31:36.030 --> 31:38.161
You ruined everything.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.771
Ruined what?

31:39.773 --> 31:41.425
Ever since you came out
with your bullshit video...

31:41.427 --> 31:43.296
Jesus.
What's wrong with you?

31:43.298 --> 31:45.559
...no one will stay there.
I have to sell the place.

31:45.561 --> 31:46.908
Oh, so, what's your plan?

31:46.910 --> 31:51.391
You drive three hours to,
what, beat me up?

31:51.393 --> 31:53.787
Let's just calm down,
and talk about this.

31:57.008 --> 31:58.270
What is going on here?

32:00.750 --> 32:02.446
Who are you?

32:02.448 --> 32:04.274
Are you the owner?

32:04.276 --> 32:07.190
I said, "Who are you?"

32:07.192 --> 32:08.974
You better watch out
for these two.

32:08.976 --> 32:10.889
They're snakes.

32:10.891 --> 32:13.674
they'll make up a bunch of lies
about you, and ruin your life.

32:13.676 --> 32:15.461
Look at what she did
to your house.

32:19.247 --> 32:21.204
Did you do that?

32:21.206 --> 32:22.727
I couldn't help it.

32:22.729 --> 32:25.121
I saw them up there,
and I...

32:25.123 --> 32:27.384
These two,
they came into my home,

32:27.386 --> 32:29.995
and they destroyed
my entire business.

32:29.997 --> 32:33.825
So, you came here
and broke mywindow.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.131
I know.
I'm sorry about that.

32:35.133 --> 32:37.437
I really am. But...

32:37.439 --> 32:41.267
- You don't understand.
- I understand just fine.

32:41.269 --> 32:43.878
And if you don't leave now,
I'm calling the police.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.533
These people are not
who they say they are.

32:46.535 --> 32:48.927
- You better watch.
- Get off my property!

32:48.929 --> 32:52.496
Geez. Alright.
I'm going.

32:52.498 --> 32:54.193
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

32:54.195 --> 32:56.937
Go! Now! Or I swear to God,
I will cut you open!

33:15.303 --> 33:17.303
Well, then.

33:17.305 --> 33:18.652
That was something.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.961
You're...

33:22.963 --> 33:24.528
kind of a badass.

33:24.530 --> 33:27.096
Oh. No.

33:27.098 --> 33:30.316
I just hate what a mess
this trip has been for you guys.

33:30.318 --> 33:32.101
I can't even begin
to imagine

33:32.103 --> 33:33.972
what your video
is gonna be like.

33:33.974 --> 33:36.627
Believe me,
we're having a great time.

33:36.629 --> 33:38.368
Yeah. Her place
was a total shithole,

33:38.370 --> 33:39.978
and she was
a complete psychopath.

33:39.980 --> 33:41.675
Yeah.

33:41.677 --> 33:44.287
Look, I came down to say
I have some time now,

33:44.289 --> 33:48.943
and I'd like to do
that interview.

33:48.945 --> 33:51.859
- Really?
- Yeah. Sure.

33:51.861 --> 33:54.819
Why not?

33:54.821 --> 33:56.170
Okay.

34:02.394 --> 34:04.483
I can't believe we didn't have
the camera with us.

34:11.228 --> 34:13.318
- Sound good?
- It sounds great.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.672
I've never done this before,
so it might not be very good.

34:22.675 --> 34:24.804
No, this is gonna be
super easy.

34:24.806 --> 34:27.764
And we're not live, so,
if you flub a line, just stop.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.072
We'll go back.

34:32.946 --> 34:36.947
Hey, this is gonna be fun.

34:36.949 --> 34:39.603
Let's roll, Kim.

34:39.605 --> 34:41.170
Speeding.

34:47.438 --> 34:49.179
Do I look at you,
or at the camera?

34:52.183 --> 34:54.313
Just look at me.

34:54.315 --> 34:56.489
I'm not even here.

34:56.491 --> 35:00.580
Look at you.
Got it.

35:00.582 --> 35:02.669
Alright, Rebecca,
we're gonna start off

35:02.671 --> 35:06.369
with a friendly introduction,
sort of like a,

35:06.371 --> 35:09.502
"Hi, my name is Rebecca
and I'm a superhost."

35:09.504 --> 35:10.851
You can say
something like that.

35:10.853 --> 35:13.463
That would be great.

35:13.465 --> 35:18.119
Hi. My name is Rebecca,
and I'm a superhost.

35:18.121 --> 35:21.079
Awesome. And that smile
at the end was perfect.

35:21.081 --> 35:24.082
Okay, so, we're gonna get into
the real questions now.

35:24.084 --> 35:26.998
And I'm not on camera.
You can't hear or see me.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.479
If you can incorporate
the question into the answers.

35:29.481 --> 35:32.003
Let's say I'm asking you,
"What color is your shirt?"

35:32.005 --> 35:33.700
Instead of saying "red,"
you would say,

35:33.702 --> 35:36.050
"The color of my shirt
is red."

35:36.052 --> 35:39.140
- Make sense?
- But my shirt is white.

35:39.142 --> 35:41.317
Yeah. So, then,
you would say,

35:41.319 --> 35:43.536
The color of my shirt
is white."

35:43.538 --> 35:44.798
- Right?
- Yeah.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.757
I think so.

35:46.759 --> 35:49.716
Okay.
Let's... Let's get going.

35:49.718 --> 35:53.372
So, Rebecca, how did you
decide to get into

35:53.374 --> 35:55.418
renting out your house?

35:55.420 --> 35:59.248
For starters,
this isn't really my house.

35:59.250 --> 36:02.076
My father left it to me
when he died.

36:02.078 --> 36:05.819
He owned it with my stepmom,
and when he passed,

36:05.821 --> 36:07.908
she got his house
in South Carolina,

36:07.910 --> 36:09.649
and I got this one.

36:09.651 --> 36:12.261
Oh, wow. I'm...

36:12.263 --> 36:14.045
so sorry to hear that.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.742
But it must be nice
to have a place like this

36:15.744 --> 36:17.004
to remember him by.

36:17.006 --> 36:19.006
Yeah, it's great.

36:19.008 --> 36:20.791
I have a smaller place
not far from here...

36:20.793 --> 36:22.619
much smaller...

36:22.621 --> 36:25.535
so I'm able to
keep an eye on it.

36:25.537 --> 36:28.842
But... it felt wrong
to keep it empty.

36:28.844 --> 36:32.150
So, when all of these
vacation home-sharing websites

36:32.152 --> 36:35.675
started popping up,
I signed up.

36:35.677 --> 36:36.981
Here we are.

36:36.983 --> 36:38.809
That's great.

36:38.811 --> 36:41.594
Any particular experiences
with the rental

36:41.596 --> 36:44.162
that you'd like to share?

36:44.164 --> 36:46.077
You know, maybe someone
that has stayed,

36:46.079 --> 36:48.427
and left a memorable
impression on you?

36:48.429 --> 36:50.255
Yeah.

36:50.257 --> 36:52.475
You know what?

36:52.477 --> 36:54.043
There was this one.

37:05.751 --> 37:07.620
An older couple.

37:07.622 --> 37:11.537
They rented the place for
an entire month over Christmas.

37:11.539 --> 37:13.322
They saw that
I was living alone,

37:13.324 --> 37:16.368
and all of their kids
had kids,

37:16.370 --> 37:18.283
and did their own thing
for the holidays.

37:18.285 --> 37:20.503
So, they invited me in.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.940
And we spent
the holidays together.

37:22.942 --> 37:27.727
Christmas, New Year's,
I was here with them.

37:27.729 --> 37:30.164
It was nice.

37:30.166 --> 37:32.125
It was like I was
their family.

37:54.060 --> 37:55.451
Re... Re...

37:55.453 --> 37:58.758
It is the best holiday
I ever had.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.717
They live back
in South Carolina,

38:00.719 --> 38:01.981
but are just...

38:03.809 --> 38:06.420
...the nicest people.

38:10.990 --> 38:13.164
I...

38:13.166 --> 38:14.646
I think...
I think that's great.

38:16.822 --> 38:18.169
Awesome job.

38:18.171 --> 38:22.347
Oh, if we could get
one final line.

38:22.349 --> 38:23.653
Of course.

38:23.655 --> 38:25.568
Yeah,
this is just a sign-off.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.092
If you can say, "Hi,
my name is Rebecca,"

38:28.094 --> 38:31.182
pause, and then,
with the most enthusiasm

38:31.184 --> 38:33.532
that you can,
finish it off with, you know,

38:33.534 --> 38:35.362
"I am a superhost.

38:37.712 --> 38:39.888
Hi.
My name is Rebecca.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.764
And I am a superhost!

38:48.201 --> 38:50.682
Hi. My name is Rebecca.

38:53.554 --> 38:57.253
And I am a superhost!

38:58.994 --> 39:02.561
That is the craziest shit
I've ever seen.

39:02.563 --> 39:04.041
I knew when we got here.

39:04.043 --> 39:05.651
What do you mean?

39:05.653 --> 39:08.132
This is what people
want to see.

39:08.134 --> 39:11.572
They want to see people
like that... complete lunatics.

39:17.535 --> 39:19.362
We got to get
more of her.

39:24.063 --> 39:27.151
This chick is gold.

39:27.153 --> 39:29.196
Let's watch it again.

39:29.198 --> 39:31.723
Hi. My name is Rebecca.

39:33.768 --> 39:36.771
And I am a superhost!

39:42.211 --> 39:44.124
What's up, guys.

39:44.126 --> 39:46.257
Claire's sleeping right now,
and we have a brand-new episode

39:46.259 --> 39:47.824
that's slowly uploading.

39:47.826 --> 39:49.956
But I wanted to record
a quick update

39:49.958 --> 39:52.916
on the super-top-secret
proposal video.

39:52.918 --> 39:54.613
Also, you should hit
that "like" button.

39:54.615 --> 39:56.963
Don't forget
to subscribe.

39:56.965 --> 40:00.140
So, in the morning,
I'm gonna take her up there.

40:00.142 --> 40:04.841
And the view is supposed
to be spectacular.

40:04.843 --> 40:06.366
That's where
I'm gonna do it.

40:10.152 --> 40:11.761
I thought
I heard her.

40:11.763 --> 40:14.981
Anyway, just wanted to give you
a quick update.

40:14.983 --> 40:16.679
I can't wait to see her face
when she finds out

40:16.681 --> 40:18.811
why we really
came out here.

40:18.813 --> 40:20.770
I should get going.
She's a light sleeper.

40:20.772 --> 40:22.293
But I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

41:32.844 --> 41:35.540
So, Teddy thought it would be
a great idea

41:35.542 --> 41:36.846
to wake up bright
and early,

41:36.848 --> 41:39.631
to go walking in
the middle of nowhere?

41:39.633 --> 41:42.503
To make matters worse, our
upload didn't work last night.

41:42.505 --> 41:43.809
It seems the Internet
is down,

41:43.811 --> 41:45.855
so, who knows if
you'll ever see it.

41:45.857 --> 41:48.248
Yes, but I did write to Rebecca
this morning,

41:48.250 --> 41:49.728
and it should be fixed
by the time we get back.

41:49.730 --> 41:50.990
Yeah, we'll see about that.

41:50.992 --> 41:53.558
Speaking of Rebecca,

41:53.560 --> 41:56.039
I don't think I have ever
seen anything as crazy

41:56.041 --> 41:57.910
as what we witnessed
yesterday.

41:57.912 --> 41:59.695
We're gonna have to shoot some
kind of re-enactment for you,

41:59.697 --> 42:04.090
but basically, she nearly beat
the crap out of that bitch Vera.

42:04.092 --> 42:05.526
Remember her?

42:05.528 --> 42:07.790
Yeah, well,
she drove all the way here,

42:07.792 --> 42:10.053
shows up out of nowhere,
all huffing and puffing.

42:10.055 --> 42:11.794
- Come on.
- One second.

42:11.796 --> 42:15.493
That's right...
the Bitch from Draper came here,

42:15.495 --> 42:17.626
and threw a rock
at a window.

42:17.628 --> 42:21.020
I mean, we went out there, and
she legit wanted to fight me.

42:21.022 --> 42:23.240
And then, Rebecca, this host,
comes out of nowhere,

42:23.242 --> 42:27.113
goes fully crazy, and that bitch
just hightails it out of here.

42:27.115 --> 42:29.725
Hey. Come on.

42:29.727 --> 42:31.161
Fine.

42:31.163 --> 42:32.902
Party pooper.

42:50.269 --> 42:51.572
Wow.

42:51.574 --> 42:53.011
Yeah.

42:55.883 --> 42:59.189
Okay.

42:59.191 --> 43:02.453
Check out this view
we have here.

43:02.455 --> 43:04.500
This is unbelievable.

43:09.636 --> 43:10.940
Here.

43:10.942 --> 43:12.334
Why don't you
want to film?

43:19.602 --> 43:21.733
What are you doing?

43:21.735 --> 43:25.476
Just...

43:25.478 --> 43:28.522
I just want to look at you
for a moment.

43:28.524 --> 43:31.743
What?

43:31.745 --> 43:34.485
I know how stressed
you've been lately,

43:34.487 --> 43:37.575
and I just want to take
a minute to...

43:37.577 --> 43:40.752
tell you just how much
I appreciate you.

43:40.754 --> 43:42.798
Teddy, I...

43:42.800 --> 43:44.192
One moment.

43:49.241 --> 43:51.110
- I've been thinking.
- That's never good.

43:51.112 --> 43:52.938
I've been thinking

43:52.940 --> 43:55.941
that you and I have been
doing this show

43:55.943 --> 43:57.682
for a while now.

43:57.684 --> 44:00.729
And we've been together
even longer than that.

44:00.731 --> 44:05.603
And we do
everything together...

44:05.605 --> 44:08.693
everything.

44:08.695 --> 44:13.176
And I just want to continue
doing everything together...

44:13.178 --> 44:17.310
the show... life...

44:17.312 --> 44:21.184
everything.

44:21.186 --> 44:23.014
Teddy...

44:25.973 --> 44:28.495
So, I spoke with your parents
last week.

44:28.497 --> 44:30.541
You did?

44:30.543 --> 44:31.847
Yeah.

44:31.849 --> 44:34.066
Your dad told me
a long time ago

44:34.068 --> 44:36.329
that I had to talk to him
before I got any ideas.

44:36.331 --> 44:38.201
So I did.

44:38.203 --> 44:39.506
I talked to
your mom and dad,

44:39.508 --> 44:44.990
and I asked them
if this was okay.

44:44.992 --> 44:48.298
Claire...

44:48.300 --> 44:51.040
will you marry me?

44:51.042 --> 44:52.737
Yes! Of course!

44:52.739 --> 44:56.697
Yes!

44:56.699 --> 44:59.265
Teddy, you're a genius.

44:59.267 --> 45:01.224
- What do you mean?
- A secret proposal?

45:01.226 --> 45:03.837
It's perfect.
People love this shit.

45:11.149 --> 45:13.627
Ready?

45:13.629 --> 45:15.281
Oh, my god!

45:15.283 --> 45:17.283
This guy
just proposed to me!

45:17.285 --> 45:19.068
I've never had such
a big surprise in my life!

45:19.070 --> 45:20.765
Claire.
Claire, stop.

45:20.767 --> 45:22.203
What?

45:26.947 --> 45:28.340
You're serious?

45:31.386 --> 45:33.560
Jesus, Ted.

45:33.562 --> 45:35.214
You set the camera up
for it.

45:35.216 --> 45:36.955
- I figured it was...
- Yeah, I know. That was dumb.

45:36.957 --> 45:38.348
No, it's just...

45:38.350 --> 45:39.960
did you really
talk to my dad?

45:44.922 --> 45:46.227
Teddy!

45:50.536 --> 45:52.928
Teddy.

45:52.930 --> 45:55.452
Teddy, come on.
Let's talk about this.

45:55.454 --> 45:56.975
Nothing to talk about.

45:56.977 --> 45:58.803
I'm sorry that I didn't
take that seriously,

45:58.805 --> 46:00.805
but you have to understand
how it looked.

46:00.807 --> 46:02.676
I thought I did.

46:02.678 --> 46:04.678
I'm sorry.

46:04.680 --> 46:06.419
It's just not something
that I was expecting

46:06.421 --> 46:07.856
to happen on this trip.

46:07.858 --> 46:10.075
And I've been so distracted
with everything.

46:10.077 --> 46:15.689
And I hate that your parents
are helping us right now.

46:15.691 --> 46:18.954
I know that you think
I just obsess over clicks,

46:18.956 --> 46:22.827
but I'm doing this
for us.

46:22.829 --> 46:25.221
And I'm sorry if it doesn't
seem that way right now,

46:25.223 --> 46:28.659
but I promise...

46:28.661 --> 46:32.445
when we get home,
we'll talk about this.

46:32.447 --> 46:33.753
No cameras.

46:37.322 --> 46:38.584
Okay.

46:48.507 --> 46:51.377
So, what do you
want to do now?

46:51.379 --> 46:53.031
I don't know.

46:53.033 --> 46:55.381
Can we just have
a quiet day together?

46:55.383 --> 46:58.515
Yeah.
That would be nice.

46:58.517 --> 46:59.953
At least
the hard drive came.

47:08.962 --> 47:10.309
It's not working.

47:12.183 --> 47:15.053
The code's not working.
Its 8587, right?

47:15.055 --> 47:16.881
Let me try.

47:21.279 --> 47:22.539
It is 8587.

47:24.282 --> 47:25.672
This makes no sense.

47:34.379 --> 47:37.641
Sorry, guys.
The panel isn't working.

47:37.643 --> 47:40.818
I'll head over in just a minute
to fix it for you.

47:40.820 --> 47:46.432
Hope this doesn't
affect the review.

47:46.434 --> 47:47.956
...the place for an entire
month of Christmas.

47:47.958 --> 47:50.045
That saw that I
was living alone.

47:50.047 --> 47:51.611
All their kids had kids,

47:51.613 --> 47:53.178
and did their own thing
for the holidays.

47:53.180 --> 47:55.833
- So, they invited me in.
- Claire.

47:55.835 --> 47:59.489
We spent
the holidays together.

47:59.491 --> 48:04.450
Christmas, New Year's.
I was here with them.

48:04.452 --> 48:08.019
Betty and Lou.

48:08.021 --> 48:09.586
It was like I was
their family.

48:09.588 --> 48:12.893
I think we should go.

48:12.895 --> 48:14.808
And she for sure said
she made it up?

48:14.810 --> 48:17.768
She said she didn't want
to use her real name.

48:17.770 --> 48:20.466
What does that mean?
Why would she lie about that?

48:20.468 --> 48:21.990
That doesn't make
any sense.

48:21.992 --> 48:23.339
Do You really want to
stick around to find out?

48:23.341 --> 48:24.862
Teddy, we're so close.

48:24.864 --> 48:27.038
I can feel it.
This video is gonna be great.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.942
Screw this.

49:20.006 --> 49:21.484
That was kind of tense.

49:21.486 --> 49:23.531
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.

49:37.980 --> 49:40.592
I wonder if we can get a refund
for our last day.

49:53.605 --> 49:55.041
Oh, no.

50:21.676 --> 50:23.241
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:23.243 --> 50:25.417
- Are you guys leaving?
- Yeah. Yeah.

50:25.419 --> 50:26.940
We got everything
we needed here.

50:26.942 --> 50:28.333
You know,
got a long drive back,

50:28.335 --> 50:30.074
so thought we'd head out
a bit early.

50:30.076 --> 50:31.902
Oh, great.

50:31.904 --> 50:33.773
Well, I hope you
enjoyed your stay.

50:33.775 --> 50:35.993
We did. It was great.
Thank you.

50:35.995 --> 50:38.038
I look forward
to your review.

50:38.040 --> 50:39.520
Yeah, for sure.

50:42.001 --> 50:44.871
- Well...
- Oh, I almost forgot.

50:44.873 --> 50:47.657
There was one more thing
I wanted to show you.

50:47.659 --> 50:49.224
Can you get your camera?
It'll be quick.

50:49.226 --> 50:51.313
I promise.

50:51.315 --> 50:54.229
- Like, here?
- Yeah. It's just down there.

50:54.231 --> 50:56.883
Don't worry.
It'll be great.

50:56.885 --> 50:59.973
I mean, consider it.
I know you have to leave.

50:59.975 --> 51:01.803
It's gonna be so good
for our video.

51:09.246 --> 51:11.159
- Let's do it.
- What?

51:11.161 --> 51:12.812
We need to get
more footage of her.

51:12.814 --> 51:15.598
- We already have great stuff.
- And we can get more.

51:15.600 --> 51:16.860
Look at her.

51:16.862 --> 51:19.776
She's harmless.

51:19.778 --> 51:22.300
Teddy, this video
is gonna be huge.

51:22.302 --> 51:23.867
I don't feel good
about this.

51:23.869 --> 51:27.262
I know.
But if we can get this right,

51:27.264 --> 51:29.135
we could afford
our own place again.

51:39.711 --> 51:41.014
Is he camera ready?

51:41.016 --> 51:42.451
Yeah. We're rolling.

51:42.453 --> 51:43.756
How do I look.
Is the lighting good?

51:43.758 --> 51:45.020
Sound check?

51:47.153 --> 51:48.500
How's that sound?
Sorry.

51:48.502 --> 51:49.719
I don't really know
what that does.

51:49.721 --> 51:51.199
I've just seen you guys
do it.

51:51.201 --> 51:53.766
- Yeah, yeah, it sounds good.
- Okay. Great.

51:53.768 --> 51:56.639
Okay. Ready.

51:59.774 --> 52:02.862
Hey, guys,
and welcome to "Superhost."

52:02.864 --> 52:04.821
Is it okay if I say that?

52:04.823 --> 52:06.605
- Sure.
- Okay. Great.

52:06.607 --> 52:09.260
Hey, guys,
And welcome to "Superhost."

52:09.262 --> 52:11.654
Rebecca...

52:11.656 --> 52:14.047
what are we doing here?

52:14.049 --> 52:15.397
I'm sorry,

52:15.399 --> 52:16.878
Where are you
taking us?

52:21.318 --> 52:25.624
I see your hand is looking
a little light, there, Claire.

52:25.626 --> 52:29.280
- What?
- Didn't old Teddy Bear propose?

52:29.282 --> 52:31.980
That's what he was supposed
to be doing today.

52:33.765 --> 52:36.766
Guess he had
a change of heart.

52:36.768 --> 52:40.160
No matter.

52:40.162 --> 52:42.206
Eyes over here.

52:42.208 --> 52:43.601
Camera.

52:49.302 --> 52:52.042
Hey, guys, and welcome
to "Superhost."

52:52.044 --> 52:54.044
We have one final surprise
for you

52:54.046 --> 52:56.220
that I think
you're gonna love.

52:56.222 --> 52:59.878
This is gonna be the best
episode of "Superhost" yet.

53:07.581 --> 53:08.885
Come on.

53:08.887 --> 53:10.236
This way.

53:17.809 --> 53:19.025
Where'd she go?

53:27.862 --> 53:30.907
I couldn't help myself.
I'm sorry.

53:30.909 --> 53:34.214
Come on.
It's this way.

53:34.216 --> 53:38.871
Oh, I totally forgot.

53:38.873 --> 53:42.440
Here. This isn't live,
so you can edit this in after.

53:42.442 --> 53:45.400
Just wanted to make sure
we have it.

53:45.402 --> 53:47.967
Don't forget to smash
that "like" button,

53:47.969 --> 53:51.756
and hit that little bell icon,
so you never miss an episode.

53:54.672 --> 53:55.934
Come on.

54:00.939 --> 54:03.115
- Holy shit.
- Ta-da.

54:08.990 --> 54:12.427
Look what I found.

54:15.910 --> 54:17.214
Cut her loose.

54:17.216 --> 54:20.086
I will.
Don't worry.

54:20.088 --> 54:22.001
Why aren't you
filming this?

54:22.003 --> 54:23.525
You're sick.

54:23.527 --> 54:26.005
No, you're sick...

54:26.007 --> 54:29.661
taking advantage of this woman
like that.

54:29.663 --> 54:32.664
Film this.

54:32.666 --> 54:34.274
Film this,
or I cut her throat.

54:42.763 --> 54:46.156
Thank you.

54:46.158 --> 54:50.508
So, Vera, here,
the old Bitch from Draper,

54:50.510 --> 54:54.947
tells me that she lost her
income because of your two.

54:54.949 --> 54:56.255
Is that true?

54:58.039 --> 55:00.302
Is it?!
I don't... I don't know.

55:02.653 --> 55:04.217
That's not what we tried
to do with it.

55:04.219 --> 55:05.480
Is this true?

55:13.577 --> 55:15.664
Here's the thing...

55:15.666 --> 55:19.450
I hated that everything
kept going wrong for you guys.

55:19.452 --> 55:22.584
And I was trying my hardest
to get you the best video ever.

55:22.586 --> 55:25.761
But then, after watching
a little more of you two,

55:25.763 --> 55:28.851
I realize
you're not the perfect duo

55:28.853 --> 55:31.984
you pretend to be
in your stupid videos.

55:31.986 --> 55:35.597
So, when Vera, here, took her
a little revenge trip...

55:35.599 --> 55:38.513
which has horribly
backfired...

55:38.515 --> 55:41.298
I knew...

55:41.300 --> 55:44.085
we need to capitalize
on this.

55:47.437 --> 55:48.742
Camera.

55:51.832 --> 55:53.528
I'm sorry.

55:53.530 --> 55:55.094
This is really
going to hurt.

56:15.334 --> 56:17.203
I know.

56:17.205 --> 56:18.857
I know.
That hurts a lot.

56:18.859 --> 56:20.470
I'm sorry.

56:23.603 --> 56:24.909
How was that?

56:26.171 --> 56:28.998
What's wrong?
Did you get it?

56:29.000 --> 56:31.304
Claire,
why aren't you filming?

56:31.306 --> 56:33.002
Isn't this what you do?

56:33.004 --> 56:35.221
This should be great
for your show.

56:35.223 --> 56:36.703
What's the problem?

56:49.499 --> 56:52.500
Ready?

56:52.502 --> 56:54.023
Ow.

56:54.025 --> 56:56.591
One, two, three, up.

56:56.593 --> 56:59.550
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

56:59.552 --> 57:01.117
It was all a joke?

57:01.119 --> 57:02.858
It's just a prank, bro.

57:02.860 --> 57:04.339
What the hell
is wrong with you?

57:06.124 --> 57:08.080
Thank you, Vera.

57:10.258 --> 57:12.476
Give it to me.

57:12.478 --> 57:13.784
Give it.

57:15.873 --> 57:18.484
Give it to me.

57:21.748 --> 57:24.444
No one's ever gonna see
this footage.

57:24.446 --> 57:28.753
I want you to delete
everything you shot here.

57:28.755 --> 57:32.148
I don't actually know
how this thing works.

57:32.150 --> 57:34.280
Here. Sell it.

57:34.282 --> 57:37.719
Make up for some of
your lost income.

57:37.721 --> 57:40.722
Vera... we're sorry.

57:40.724 --> 57:43.551
Fuck you.

57:43.553 --> 57:46.945
What happened
to Betty and Lou?

57:46.947 --> 57:48.427
Who?

57:51.256 --> 57:52.518
What did you do to them?

57:56.174 --> 57:58.870
God damn it.

57:58.872 --> 58:01.483
What is he
talking about?

58:08.665 --> 58:11.491
I really thought
that would work.

58:11.493 --> 58:13.929
What's going on?

58:13.931 --> 58:17.976
Boy, you weren't kidding
about these two.

58:17.978 --> 58:19.980
Can't leave
well enough alone.

58:22.330 --> 58:24.766
I'm sorry about this.

58:24.768 --> 58:26.813
About what?

58:49.314 --> 58:52.837
You guys,
you were so close.

58:52.839 --> 58:55.274
Why couldn't you
just stop?

58:55.276 --> 58:57.755
What am I gonna do
with her?

58:57.757 --> 58:59.322
Now what am I
gonna do?

59:19.953 --> 59:21.823
Hello, there.

59:21.825 --> 59:24.173
Still works.

59:30.224 --> 59:31.484
Go! Go! Go!

59:43.281 --> 59:44.672
Claire?

59:46.284 --> 59:47.762
Claire.

59:47.764 --> 59:49.067
We have to go.

59:49.069 --> 59:51.896
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:06.345
Claire.

01:00:06.347 --> 01:00:09.522
Claire?

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:11.916
I'm sorry.

01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:13.398
We should get inside.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.007
I think the car is that way.

01:00:17.445 --> 01:00:19.578
Yeah, but she might be waiting
for us.

01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:27.934
Okay, okay, okay.

01:01:08.714 --> 01:01:11.149
Do you think
she'll come back here?

01:01:14.372 --> 01:01:16.154
Yeah.

01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:30.910
Give me your phone.

01:01:37.787 --> 01:01:40.354
Where are you going?

01:01:48.232 --> 01:01:50.277
Don't let anyone open this
but me.

01:01:51.757 --> 01:01:53.975
- Teddy...
- Don't worry.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:56.586
Your dad told me he'd kill me
if anything happened to you.

01:02:53.558 --> 01:02:55.950
Oh, where are you?

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.160
What happened?

01:03:32.162 --> 01:03:33.988
I thought I heard her.

01:03:37.863 --> 01:03:40.603
I'm not a hero.
I'm a...

01:03:40.605 --> 01:03:42.650
I'm a vlogger.

01:03:51.616 --> 01:03:54.053
Okay. Okay.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:59.970
No, no, no. Come on.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:06.934
What?

01:04:06.936 --> 01:04:08.718
What is wrong with this thing?

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.849
Claire?

01:04:09.851 --> 01:04:10.850
Hold on.

01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:14.245
- Claire.
- What?

01:04:15.814 --> 01:04:16.902
She's here.

01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:36.269
What is she doing?

01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:39.705
I don't know.

01:05:20.705 --> 01:05:22.226
Stop!

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.240
Just let us go, please.

01:05:36.242 --> 01:05:37.981
We aren't gonna tell anyone.

01:05:37.983 --> 01:05:41.115
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:05:41.117 --> 01:05:42.638
Of course you will.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.293
Think of all the hits you get.

01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:47.860
I can see the thumbnail now...

01:05:47.862 --> 01:05:51.690
"The Crazy Bitch Who Killed
the Crazy Bitch From Draper."

01:05:51.692 --> 01:05:54.608
No. We'll delete everything.
I promise.

01:05:56.132 --> 01:05:58.088
P-Please.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:00.308
I'm sorry.

01:06:09.667 --> 01:06:10.755
Where'd she go?

01:06:18.154 --> 01:06:19.981
We have to get out of here.

01:06:22.593 --> 01:06:24.114
What are you...

01:06:24.116 --> 01:06:26.856
What are you doing?

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:28.945
I want to see if there's
another way out of here.

01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:31.208
Keep an eye on the windows.

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:34.387
Go.
I'll be right back.

01:07:27.745 --> 01:07:29.179
Holy shit.

01:08:04.825 --> 01:08:06.869
Where are you?

01:08:21.537 --> 01:08:22.885
Hey, Teddy.

01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:35.639
What are you doing?

01:08:38.685 --> 01:08:41.163
Silent treatment, eh?

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:45.081
Alright, that's fine.
I get it.

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:50.260
Say, Ted, you want to know
what happened to Betty and Lou?

01:08:50.261 --> 01:08:52.609
I really did love those two,

01:08:52.612 --> 01:08:55.917
but they... they wouldn't
let me stay.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.746
I told them
I would do anything,

01:08:57.747 --> 01:08:59.703
that I couldn't leave
this place, it was my home.

01:08:59.706 --> 01:09:02.185
But they just wouldn't listen.

01:09:02.187 --> 01:09:05.100
They left me no choice.

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:09.714
Betty and Lou
and their little cat too.

01:09:09.716 --> 01:09:13.892
Look, I'm gonna be honest.

01:09:13.894 --> 01:09:17.765
You two aren't making it
out of here alive.

01:09:39.136 --> 01:09:41.616
Okay. Okay.

01:09:51.192 --> 01:09:54.106
If anyone is out there watching,
please, please help us.

01:09:54.108 --> 01:09:57.980
I was almost out the door
when Lou just got angry at me.

01:09:57.982 --> 01:09:59.982
He got hysterical.

01:09:59.984 --> 01:10:03.072
I don't know
what happened after that.

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:04.987
It's all kind of a blur,
but

01:10:04.989 --> 01:10:07.119
I'll tell you what, Teddy,

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:11.994
I just kind of... snapped.

01:10:11.996 --> 01:10:13.952
This woman, Rebecca, said that
she was the host of this place,

01:10:13.954 --> 01:10:15.171
but she's not.

01:10:15.173 --> 01:10:17.260
She's a... She's a...

01:10:17.262 --> 01:10:19.306
She's a murderer.

01:10:19.308 --> 01:10:21.569
Then do you know
what happened?

01:10:21.571 --> 01:10:23.964
I had to clean up.

01:10:25.052 --> 01:10:28.097
And the funniest part
of it all?

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:31.013
Their stupid cat put up
more of a fight than they did.

01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:34.190
I don't know how much time
we have left,

01:10:34.192 --> 01:10:36.975
so please just call...
call the police, call someone.

01:10:36.977 --> 01:10:37.976
We... We need help.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:45.027
Come on, please, please, please.

01:10:45.029 --> 01:10:47.246
And when it was over,

01:10:47.248 --> 01:10:50.032
just when
I was almost cleaned up

01:10:50.034 --> 01:10:52.382
and everything was right again,

01:10:52.384 --> 01:10:55.648
just when I thought I could
get out of here scot-free...

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:58.388
...you guys came.

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.872
Hi, Claire.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:14.970
Claire!

01:11:21.282 --> 01:11:24.066
It's not what it looks like.

01:11:24.068 --> 01:11:25.199
Rebecca, please.

01:11:58.972 --> 01:12:00.842
Stop!

01:12:00.844 --> 01:12:03.410
Stop!

01:13:01.382 --> 01:13:02.860
Oh, hi, Teddy!

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:19.268
Hey, guys! And welcome to
another episode of "Superhost."

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.052
My name is BettyLou52,

01:13:21.054 --> 01:13:24.012

the most special episode yet.

as we hunt down
your favorite host, Teddy!

01:13:28.148 --> 01:13:31.672
First impressions of this place
are not good.

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:33.717
There is blood everywhere.

01:13:33.719 --> 01:13:36.633
And I found a dead body
in the basement.

01:13:36.635 --> 01:13:40.768
Absolutely zero stars!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:56.174
Teddy!

01:13:59.658 --> 01:14:04.531
You know you're leaving a path
of blood behind you, right?

01:14:04.533 --> 01:14:06.445
Teddy!

01:14:06.447 --> 01:14:09.361
Why are you running?

01:14:09.363 --> 01:14:11.322
I hate running.

01:14:12.932 --> 01:14:15.542
Teddy!

01:14:15.544 --> 01:14:18.153
I'm gonna find you!

01:14:29.122 --> 01:14:31.645
Teddy!

01:14:31.647 --> 01:14:34.822
Theodore!

01:14:34.824 --> 01:14:38.303
Theodore, darling, come back!

01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:41.845
Teddy!

01:15:41.847 --> 01:15:43.412
Teddy.

01:15:54.164 --> 01:15:56.991
Teddy.

01:16:00.213 --> 01:16:02.823
Teddy!

01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:05.347
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:11.005
Whoop! Scared me.

01:16:11.007 --> 01:16:13.747
Hey there, Ted-a-rino!

01:16:13.749 --> 01:16:16.229
Huh?
What do we have here?

01:16:19.276 --> 01:16:22.018
That was a close one.

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:27.806
Anything to add to my glowing
review of the house?

01:16:29.895 --> 01:16:31.027
Hmm.

01:16:39.383 --> 01:16:41.254
Feel a little life there, yeah.

01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:46.257
Hey! No.

01:16:46.259 --> 01:16:47.696
Bad.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.356
Yes! Ah!

01:16:58.358 --> 01:17:01.055
Yes, yes, I say yes!

01:17:04.843 --> 01:17:06.930
What do you think?

01:17:06.932 --> 01:17:10.586
Shall we turn the camera,
leave people to wonder?

01:17:10.588 --> 01:17:14.026
No.
Give the people what they want!

01:17:20.206 --> 01:17:22.731
You were
my favorite.

01:17:39.748 --> 01:17:42.574

Um, if...

01:19:50.966 --> 01:19:52.356
If anyone out there
is watching, please...

01:19:52.358 --> 01:19:53.531
please help us.

01:19:53.533 --> 01:19:55.446
We've... We've been attacked,

01:19:55.448 --> 01:19:57.709
and we're being
held prisoners in this house.

01:19:57.711 --> 01:19:59.494
This... This woman, Rebecca,
she said that she was

01:19:59.496 --> 01:20:02.236
the host of this place,
but she's not.

01:20:04.501 --> 01:20:05.632
She's a murderer.

01:20:07.112 --> 01:20:08.459
She's a murderer.

01:20:10.899 --> 01:20:12.986
S-She killed the owners,

01:20:12.988 --> 01:20:16.598
and now she's... she's gonna
kill us, too.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:20.384
She's gonna kill us too.

01:20:20.386 --> 01:20:21.864
And I don't... I don't...

01:20:21.866 --> 01:20:23.474
I don't know
how much time we have,

01:20:23.476 --> 01:20:25.259
so please, please just call
the police.

01:20:25.261 --> 01:20:29.176
C-Call... Call someone, please.
J-Just help us.

01:20:44.367 --> 01:20:46.149
What's up, guys?
My name is Teddy.

01:20:46.151 --> 01:20:47.803
And I'm Claire.

01:20:47.805 --> 01:20:50.893
