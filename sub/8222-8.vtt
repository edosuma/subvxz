WEBVTT

00:00.556 --> 00:03.024
Do not try what you're
about to see at home.

00:03.091 --> 00:06.083
We consult with experts.
We take every precaution.

00:06.161 --> 00:09.995
And we have years of experience
in dangerous situations.

00:13.035 --> 00:14.900
On this episode
of "Mythbusters"...

00:14.970 --> 00:17.200
I am gobsmacked.

00:17.272 --> 00:20.799
<i>...Adam and Jamie
re-stage a backyard bonfire</i>

00:20.876 --> 00:24.869
of ice and thermite
that still baffles the experts.

00:24.947 --> 00:28.383
Next, Tory, Grant, and Kari
pump up the volume

00:28.450 --> 00:30.611
to try to trigger
a car full of rifles

00:30.686 --> 00:33.154
with a thumping car stereo.

00:33.222 --> 00:34.780
- Go off!
- Fire off!

00:34.856 --> 00:36.915
<i>From sound waves to shock waves,</i>

00:36.992 --> 00:39.187
the hits just keep on coming.

00:39.261 --> 00:41.354
You know how to wreck a party.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.692
<i>And then there's the myth</i>

00:42.764 --> 00:44.698
of the gun with a gas problem...

00:44.766 --> 00:45.494
Oh!

00:45.567 --> 00:47.091
<i>...where an awkward grip</i>

00:47.169 --> 00:48.898
could cost you
your favorite finger.

00:48.971 --> 00:51.235
That gun has a heck of a kick.

00:51.707 --> 00:53.368
<i>It's not for the fainthearted,</i>

00:53.442 --> 00:55.933
but there's always room
for a chicken.

01:01.817 --> 01:03.341
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:03.418 --> 01:04.407
Adam Savage...

01:04.486 --> 01:08.149
Today's forecast...
70% chance of science!

01:08.223 --> 01:09.781
<i>...and Jamie Hyneman.</i>

01:09.858 --> 01:12.554
It's fun yet deadly.

01:12.628 --> 01:14.528
<i>Between them, more than 30 years</i>

01:14.596 --> 01:17.588
of special-effects experience.

01:17.666 --> 01:19.896
Joining them...

01:19.968 --> 01:21.094
...Tory Belleci...

01:21.169 --> 01:22.261
Aah!

01:22.337 --> 01:24.635
<i>- ... Grant Imahara...
- Aaaaah!</i>

01:24.706 --> 01:26.139
<i>and Kari Byron.</i>

01:26.208 --> 01:27.641
That was a rush!

01:28.777 --> 01:31.245
<i>They don't just tell the myths.</i>

01:31.313 --> 01:34.373
They put them to the test.

01:42.190 --> 01:46.251
Myth number one
is a tale of two extremes.

01:46.328 --> 01:48.592
All right, dude, time
to fire up that dial-up modem.

01:48.664 --> 01:50.598
We're going back to the Internet
for this story.

01:50.666 --> 01:53.601
Oh, well, if it's from
the Internet, it must be true.

01:53.669 --> 01:55.000
You don't have to be
sarcastic.

01:55.070 --> 01:57.231
This one's about thermite,
and I think you'll like it.

01:57.306 --> 01:58.295
- What is it?
- All right.

01:58.373 --> 02:00.170
These two guys...
They take a bucket of thermite,

02:00.242 --> 02:01.436
put it on a bunch
of blocks of ice,

02:01.510 --> 02:02.499
and light it with a fuse.

02:02.577 --> 02:04.772
And it doesn't just burn
like we've seen thermite burn.

02:04.846 --> 02:07.781
The whole friggin' thing
explodes!

02:07.849 --> 02:10.079
Watch this clip, man. I think
it's actually pretty credible.

02:10.651 --> 02:13.086
<i>Thermite itself
shouldn't explode,</i>

02:13.155 --> 02:16.147
though it burns at
ferociously high temperatures.

02:16.224 --> 02:19.489
And you'd figure
that ice would just melt, right?

02:19.561 --> 02:23.088
But this clip seems to show
that when ice meets fire,

02:23.165 --> 02:26.794
the least of your worries
is getting your socks wet.

02:27.469 --> 02:29.027
Oh, sweet.

02:29.104 --> 02:30.594
Well, they sure made
our job easier.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.606
They showed us everything
we need to set this up.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.005
Absolutely.

02:34.076 --> 02:36.544
11 pounds of thermite,
10 one-pound blocks of ice.

02:36.611 --> 02:39.478
And a fuse and a pack of matches
to set the whole thing off.

02:39.548 --> 02:41.846
I love it. Let's head out to
the bomb range and try it out.

02:41.917 --> 02:42.975
Okay.

02:43.051 --> 02:45.349
<i>Now, these two know
their thermite.</i>

02:45.420 --> 02:47.945
Who could forget
the racing stripe they burned

02:48.023 --> 02:49.081
through the roof of a car

02:49.157 --> 02:51.751
for the "Better to End
with a Bang" myth?

02:54.296 --> 02:58.562
But now, before trying
to replicate the ice explosion,

02:58.633 --> 03:01.830
Jamie wants to warm up
with a trial by fire.

03:01.903 --> 03:02.995
Now I'd like to fine-tune

03:03.071 --> 03:05.369
what you might call
the thermite delivery system,

03:05.440 --> 03:06.532
but we can also have
some fun here.

03:06.608 --> 03:09.702
So what we're building first
is a kind of pagoda from bricks

03:09.778 --> 03:11.040
and steel plates.

03:11.113 --> 03:12.876
The idea is to see
how many plates

03:12.948 --> 03:16.213
the thermite burns through
once it's ignited.

03:16.284 --> 03:19.276
<i>Thermite's a mix
of fine metallic powders,</i>

03:19.354 --> 03:22.152
but the ideal ratio
is debatable.

03:22.224 --> 03:24.988
Of course, we want the best burn
for our buck,

03:25.060 --> 03:28.052
so this penetration test
should be a great way

03:28.130 --> 03:31.156
to try out
Jamie's special blend.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.930
From here,
it's all quite simple.

03:34.002 --> 03:37.699
Jamie sets two matchbooks in
the bucket, hooked up to a fuse.

03:37.773 --> 03:41.334
Okay, this is
thermite penetration test

03:41.410 --> 03:45.278
in 3, 2, 1...

03:45.781 --> 03:48.807
<i>If all goes well,
we'll see a cascade of fire</i>

03:48.884 --> 03:51.250
burning through
a bunch of steel plates,

03:51.319 --> 03:55.278
and the thermal-imaging camera
should enhance the experience.

03:55.791 --> 03:58.055
I've always wanted
to see this thing in action

03:58.126 --> 03:59.150
just like this.

03:59.227 --> 04:01.286
As far as I know,
it's never been done before.

04:01.363 --> 04:03.388
I mean, you see what happens
after the fact,

04:03.465 --> 04:06.229
but we're gonna see
the whole thing all at once.

04:06.301 --> 04:09.031
<i>So this
little pre-myth appetizer</i>

04:09.104 --> 04:10.765
could go anywhere.

04:17.379 --> 04:18.471
There we go.

04:18.547 --> 04:20.572
- 1, 2, 3.
- Nice!

04:20.649 --> 04:23.243
Ohh.

04:23.318 --> 04:24.250
Four plates.

04:24.319 --> 04:26.810
Right, right.
The top one and three down.

04:26.888 --> 04:28.651
- That was pretty cool.
- It was.

04:29.558 --> 04:31.082
<i>"Cool" isn't the word.</i>

04:31.159 --> 04:33.184
At 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

04:33.261 --> 04:36.230
the burn is too bright to view
at close quarters.

04:36.298 --> 04:38.892
It's a major meltdown.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.366
We could hang these up
in a gallery.

04:40.435 --> 04:42.198
We'll make like
a million dollars!

04:42.771 --> 04:46.639
<i>So Jamie's special
thermite blend is hot to trot.</i>

04:46.708 --> 04:48.869
Now to see if 11 pounds of it

04:48.944 --> 04:53.381
is enough to actually explode
10 blocks of solid water.

04:53.448 --> 04:54.972
Well, look, let's clean this up,

04:55.050 --> 04:57.814
get some ice blocks out here,
and replicate that video.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.579
That's what we're here for.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:11.800 --> 05:13.597
All right. So, this myth
comes from a viewer.

05:13.668 --> 05:15.363
It's called "Woofer Weaponry. "

05:15.437 --> 05:16.995
Try saying that
three times fast.

05:17.072 --> 05:18.596
Okay, besides being
a tongue twister,

05:18.673 --> 05:19.765
what are we talking about here?

05:19.841 --> 05:23.368
This is that a subwoofer
can actually set off a weapon.

05:23.445 --> 05:24.707
But not just any weapon.

05:24.779 --> 05:28.010
A very specific type
of combat rifle called an SKS.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.550
Cool!
Tell me more.

05:29.618 --> 05:31.051
The story is that
these Russian gangsters

05:31.119 --> 05:32.381
are driving around
with these weapons

05:32.454 --> 05:33.478
in the back of their car.

05:33.555 --> 05:35.455
Let's face it. They're
gangsters. That's what you do.

05:35.524 --> 05:38.322
And their car has this
crazy booming stereo system.

05:38.393 --> 05:39.417
They pull up
next to these girls,

05:39.494 --> 05:42.361
and they try to impress them,
so they crank up the volume.

05:42.430 --> 05:45.263
The stereo system's so loud,
the guns begin to vibrate,

05:45.333 --> 05:48.097
and suddenly... bang, bang,
bang... all the guns go off.

05:48.169 --> 05:49.898
Gunfire not being
the best pickup line,

05:49.971 --> 05:51.438
I'm assuming
it scared off the girls.

05:51.506 --> 05:52.700
Talk about embarrassing.

05:52.774 --> 05:55.072
Yeah. Awkward!

05:55.143 --> 05:58.601
<i>This viewer myth
is simple and terrifying.</i>

05:58.680 --> 06:01.171
If and when the bass
gets the car bouncing,

06:01.249 --> 06:04.685
the vibration is supposed to
set off the SKS rifles.

06:04.753 --> 06:07.847
And they could potentially
keep firing bullets

06:07.923 --> 06:09.550
till the clips run out.

06:09.624 --> 06:11.285
Well, I guess
we need to get a car,

06:11.359 --> 06:14.157
install a super-loud stereo
system, crank it all the way up,

06:14.229 --> 06:16.697
throw some of these rifles
in the back, and stand back.

06:16.765 --> 06:18.699
Well, if that doesn't work,
there are these cars

06:18.767 --> 06:19.995
that are used
for these sound-offs.

06:20.068 --> 06:21.228
They're not really practical.

06:21.303 --> 06:23.271
A gangster might not have
one of these.

06:23.338 --> 06:25.203
They're basically
giant speakers on wheels.

06:25.273 --> 06:28.037
Okay, but first up, I think
we need to talk to an expert.

06:28.109 --> 06:30.407
I mean, we need to find out more
about this SKS rifle.

06:30.478 --> 06:33.106
I mean, the myth is so specific.
It's really strange.

06:33.181 --> 06:34.512
Definitely.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.210
<i>So it's "get acquainted" time</i>

06:36.284 --> 06:39.515
with the rifles renowned
for their fickle firing habits.

06:39.588 --> 06:41.852
Any of you ever shot
an SKS before?

06:41.923 --> 06:42.787
- Nope.
- Nope.

06:42.857 --> 06:45.382
But I'm looking forward to it.

06:45.460 --> 06:49.055
<i>Gunsmith Ben Murray
knows exactly why these weapons</i>

06:49.130 --> 06:51.223
occasionally shoot themselves.

06:51.299 --> 06:54.234
So, what is it about
the SKS rifle in particular

06:54.302 --> 06:55.792
that makes it so key
to this myth?

06:55.870 --> 06:57.599
It has
a free-floating firing pin,

06:57.672 --> 06:59.640
as opposed
to a spring-loaded firing pin.

06:59.708 --> 07:00.936
And I can show you that.

07:01.009 --> 07:02.704
I can disassemble it
right quick.

07:02.777 --> 07:04.972
This is the bolt assembly
that houses the firing pin,

07:05.046 --> 07:08.072
and, as you can see,
it moves forward and backwards.

07:08.149 --> 07:09.707
So that just slides around
in there.

07:09.784 --> 07:10.375
That's correct.

07:10.452 --> 07:13.148
So if there is no spring and
that pin does vibrate enough,

07:13.221 --> 07:15.018
could it potentially
set a round off?

07:15.090 --> 07:16.250
I suppose it could.

07:16.324 --> 07:18.087
So there might be some truth
to this myth.

07:18.159 --> 07:19.490
Maybe.

07:19.561 --> 07:21.791
<i>In most semiautomatic rifles,</i>

07:21.863 --> 07:24.297
the spring simply holds
the firing pin

07:24.366 --> 07:27.301
at the rear of the housing
until the hammer strikes it,

07:27.369 --> 07:30.668
driving the pin onto the primer
and firing the bullet.

07:30.739 --> 07:33.037
But the SKS, with no spring,

07:33.108 --> 07:37.442
has a firing pin that floats
free and could bounce around,

07:37.512 --> 07:40.481
potentially causing
an accidental discharge.

07:40.548 --> 07:44.006
There's plenty of verified
incidents to support the claim.

07:44.085 --> 07:47.111
But we want to know if something
as simple as sound waves

07:47.188 --> 07:50.157
could really dislodge
those springless pins.

07:50.225 --> 07:52.125
So, that kind of
looks like a problem.

07:52.193 --> 07:53.785
Yes, there's quite a few
in our country

07:53.862 --> 07:56.023
that have this
free-floating-style firing pin.

07:56.097 --> 07:57.189
In fact, that's why we came up

07:57.265 --> 07:59.927
with a spring-loaded firing pin
to replace it.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.935
<i>So Ben's fixed the problem,</i>

08:02.003 --> 08:03.732
but to properly test the myth,

08:03.805 --> 08:06.706
we're using guns
without the springs.

08:06.775 --> 08:09.471
Now, before we start testing
to see whether or not subwoofers

08:09.544 --> 08:11.842
will set one of these off
without using the trigger,

08:11.913 --> 08:13.904
we need to make sure ours work.

08:13.982 --> 08:16.212
So that's all we're doing today.
We're just shooting guns.

08:16.284 --> 08:17.774
<i>This day can't suck.</i>

08:20.255 --> 08:22.382
<i>Tory and Grant figure five guns</i>

08:22.457 --> 08:24.823
should make a mythical carful.

08:24.893 --> 08:26.724
So, on with the testing.

08:28.263 --> 08:29.730
And when the bullets run out,

08:29.798 --> 08:33.063
they can justify
their jubilation.

08:33.134 --> 08:35.294
Now, remember when I said
we're not shooting these guns

08:35.370 --> 08:36.302
just for our own enjoyment,

08:36.371 --> 08:38.134
but it's actual
scientific research?

08:38.206 --> 08:39.605
Well, it turns out it's true.

08:39.674 --> 08:41.198
I mean, we have
several of these guns,

08:41.275 --> 08:44.302
but the gun I was using
jammed twice during the test.

08:44.379 --> 08:45.903
Ready for the next?

08:45.980 --> 08:48.005
I've had a jam.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.108
So, that means
we can't use that gun

08:50.185 --> 08:52.153
for when we do the experiment
with the subwoofer,

08:52.220 --> 08:54.745
because if it does jam
during our subwoofer test,

08:54.823 --> 08:56.688
it makes it an invalid test.

08:56.758 --> 08:57.884
See?

08:57.959 --> 08:59.950
We're not just out here
shooting guns for the fun of it.

09:00.028 --> 09:02.929
This is serious
scientific experimentation!

09:03.498 --> 09:06.934
<i>With six guns tested
and five selected...</i>

09:09.337 --> 09:12.602
...it's time to fit a car
we call the Great White

09:12.674 --> 09:14.801
with a thumping sound system.

09:14.876 --> 09:17.071
So, what size stereo you
think we can get in this thing?

09:17.145 --> 09:19.807
I don't know, but we want
this thing to vibrate a lot.

09:19.881 --> 09:22.247
Well, we've got
no shortage of space.

09:22.317 --> 09:23.944
You could probably fit
like four bodies

09:24.018 --> 09:25.986
- in the back of this trunk.
- Yeah.

09:26.054 --> 09:28.488
<i>Naturally, they source the best</i>

09:28.556 --> 09:30.421
and the bassiest system in town.

09:31.726 --> 09:33.523
I'm a little embarrassed
about this car.

09:33.595 --> 09:34.857
I think
they're gonna laugh at us.

09:34.929 --> 09:36.988
<i>Dude, I'm laughing at us.</i>

09:37.065 --> 09:38.532
Oh!

09:38.600 --> 09:40.261
- That is sick!
- Wow.

09:40.335 --> 09:42.269
Hey, Kenny, Paul.
How are you guys?

09:42.337 --> 09:43.531
Hey.
Welcome to Auto Sound.

09:43.605 --> 09:44.799
The myth that we're working on

09:44.873 --> 09:47.398
involves a guy
with a really big car stereo

09:47.475 --> 09:50.706
and a special type of gun
in the backseat called an SKS.

09:50.779 --> 09:53.646
Car stereo was so loud
that when he turned it up,

09:53.715 --> 09:54.704
it set the gun off.

09:54.783 --> 09:55.875
You think it could happen?

09:55.950 --> 09:57.212
I've seen everything
from nosebleeds

09:57.285 --> 09:59.276
to cracked windshields,
so it's possible.

09:59.354 --> 10:01.652
<i>Not quite
your standard sales pitch,</i>

10:01.723 --> 10:04.851
but those cracked windshields
sound promising.

10:04.926 --> 10:07.451
Ooh!
What is that?

10:07.529 --> 10:10.930
This is a 12-inch
square driver from MTX.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.398
It's the 8500 series.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.901
It's gonna handle
about 750 watts rms,

10:14.969 --> 10:17.233
and it's square because
it has more surface area,

10:17.305 --> 10:19.205
which means it's naturally
gonna have more output.

10:19.274 --> 10:21.003
More speaker, more output.

10:21.075 --> 10:23.441
And I think it's gonna do
what you guys need it to do

10:23.511 --> 10:24.637
for your application.

10:24.712 --> 10:27.112
You got to see our car first,
and then you can make that call.

10:27.182 --> 10:28.979
Okay.

10:29.050 --> 10:31.678
<i>One thing's for
certain... A stereo like this</i>

10:31.753 --> 10:34.551
way outclasses
the car they drove up in.

10:34.622 --> 10:36.180
This is perfect!

10:44.899 --> 10:46.423
<i>Not for the first time</i>

10:46.501 --> 10:48.662
the Mythbusters are playing
with fire.

10:48.736 --> 10:49.430
There we go.

10:49.504 --> 10:50.766
- 1, 2, 3.
- Nice!

10:50.839 --> 10:52.136
<i>They're set to test</i>

10:52.207 --> 10:55.074
a dubious and dangerous
Internet video

10:55.143 --> 10:57.839
that seems to show
exploding ice.

10:57.912 --> 10:58.844
The clip shows

10:58.913 --> 11:02.440
what is purportedly 11 pounds
of thermite in a metal bucket,

11:02.517 --> 11:04.610
sitting on top
of 10 blocks of ice.

11:04.686 --> 11:07.917
They light the thermite, it does
what we expect thermite to do,

11:07.989 --> 11:09.513
but then all of a sudden...
poof...

11:09.591 --> 11:11.286
out it goes in a big explosion,

11:11.359 --> 11:13.190
flinging bits of metal
everywhere.

11:13.261 --> 11:15.593
Now, we're gonna do
exactly what they did

11:15.663 --> 11:17.597
and see if we get
the same result.

11:17.665 --> 11:20.498
<i>It's hard to believe
that mixing fire and ice</i>

11:20.568 --> 11:22.229
could ever end in a boom.

11:22.303 --> 11:26.740
Retired FBI man Frank Doyle
thinks that concealed gunpowder

11:26.808 --> 11:29.208
might be the cause
of the conflagration.

11:29.277 --> 11:31.268
Well, I'm a little skeptical.

11:31.913 --> 11:35.371
And I think they've done
something a little iffy.

11:35.450 --> 11:38.180
All right. Well, there's
only one way to find out.

11:38.253 --> 11:39.743
<i>Frank sets the fuse.</i>

11:39.821 --> 11:41.015
Adam sets the scene.

11:41.089 --> 11:42.317
Let's get behind the barrier

11:42.390 --> 11:45.359
and replicate a couple
of Internet pyromaniacs.

11:45.426 --> 11:47.485
<i>And Jamie lights the wick.</i>

11:47.562 --> 11:49.291
This is thermite and ice.

11:49.364 --> 11:53.801
In 3, 2, 1...

11:55.103 --> 11:55.967
We're good.

11:56.938 --> 12:00.101
<i>Needless to say,
never try this yourself.</i>

12:00.174 --> 12:01.903
We've got all the safety gear,

12:01.976 --> 12:04.809
the expertise,
and the blast screen.

12:04.879 --> 12:06.437
This is killing me.

12:07.315 --> 12:08.907
Don't tell me.

12:09.517 --> 12:10.984
What the heck?

12:11.052 --> 12:13.885
<i>This is close
to a worst-case scenario,</i>

12:13.955 --> 12:16.981
<i>when the explosion you're
expecting to happen doesn't.</i>

12:17.058 --> 12:18.286
I think it's a dud.

12:18.359 --> 12:21.089
<i>So Jamie slips into
something less comfortable,</i>

12:21.162 --> 12:22.891
but way more fireproof.

12:22.964 --> 12:25.159
He and Frank fashion a new fuse.

12:25.233 --> 12:27.428
Then Jamie takes a furtive walk,

12:27.502 --> 12:31.370
knowing the old fuse could catch
at any time.

12:31.439 --> 12:33.669
So, Jamie's put on
the full fire suit

12:33.741 --> 12:37.233
to protect himself to replace
another fuse and matches,

12:37.312 --> 12:38.745
because, well, we don't know.

12:38.813 --> 12:40.940
He could touch that bucket,
and it could all go off.

12:41.015 --> 12:43.540
So it's a little bit
touch and go right now.

12:43.618 --> 12:46.883
<i>Jamie wastes no time
setting the new spark.</i>

12:47.388 --> 12:48.912
He's lit it.

12:48.990 --> 12:50.617
<i>Let's hope it stays lit.</i>

12:50.692 --> 12:53.684
This experiment
should confirm or bust

12:53.761 --> 12:56.457
the myth of exploding ice.

12:56.531 --> 12:58.965
Well, looks like
the match is going off.

12:59.033 --> 13:00.864
- There it goes.
- There we go.

13:08.076 --> 13:09.907
I'd say that was an explosion.

13:09.978 --> 13:14.108
I'm pretty sure that qualifies.

13:15.717 --> 13:18.584
<i>And Adam's found
the source of that thunk</i>

13:18.653 --> 13:20.883
that shook the blast screen.

13:26.961 --> 13:28.428
In the popular parlance,

13:28.496 --> 13:30.896
we call this piece of ice
a "hunter-killer"

13:30.965 --> 13:33.695
because it went all the way
from ground zero

13:33.768 --> 13:35.167
to our blast chamber!

13:35.236 --> 13:37.295
Luckily, it is...

13:38.239 --> 13:39.831
...ice-proof.

13:39.907 --> 13:43.070
<i>Some chunks of ice
flew as far as 150 feet.</i>

13:43.144 --> 13:45.738
The brick pallet
is a smoldering ruin,

13:45.813 --> 13:49.180
and there's no trace at all
of the galvanized steel bucket.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.343
Look at that.

13:51.419 --> 13:53.284
That tells the whole story
right there.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.879
I am a believer!

13:55.957 --> 13:58.619
<i>But what actually
made the ice go boom?</i>

13:58.693 --> 14:02.060
The truth is,
no one really knows.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.324
Experts I've talked to

14:03.398 --> 14:05.798
are speculating that heat
from the burning thermite

14:05.867 --> 14:09.200
is decomposing the water
into hydrogen and oxygen,

14:09.270 --> 14:11.238
which, in the presence
of a source of ignition,

14:11.305 --> 14:14.206
namely hot thermite,
is exploding.

14:14.275 --> 14:16.243
Now, I sort of have a problem
with that,

14:16.310 --> 14:18.073
because that requires

14:18.146 --> 14:20.239
that a whole bunch
of hydrogen and oxygen

14:20.314 --> 14:22.145
be instantaneously created,

14:22.216 --> 14:24.582
and I don't know
that that's possible.

14:24.652 --> 14:28.418
There is another explanation...
I'm just speculating...

14:28.489 --> 14:31.185
and that is that something
in this reaction

14:31.259 --> 14:33.454
is aerosolizing
all the thermite.

14:33.528 --> 14:36.588
You know, the steam or something
is throwing all this powder up

14:36.664 --> 14:40.657
into a cloud of thermite,
and that's exploding.

14:40.735 --> 14:42.828
We don't know.
It's a mystery.

14:42.904 --> 14:45.896
But one way or another,
that was a heck of a bang.

14:46.574 --> 14:50.010
<i>Here's their video,
and here's ours.</i>

14:51.646 --> 14:53.546
So it's myth confirmed.

14:53.614 --> 14:56.674
No black powder,
no hidden fireworks.

14:56.751 --> 14:59.151
Just fire and ice.

15:04.092 --> 15:06.083
They've got the guns, the car,

15:06.160 --> 15:09.095
and a sound system that could
shake loose your fillings.

15:09.163 --> 15:10.528
- All right. You ready?
- Yes.

15:10.598 --> 15:13.328
- Think so.
- Ohh!

15:13.401 --> 15:15.096
Oh, yeah!

15:15.169 --> 15:16.966
So unassuming, and then bang!

15:17.038 --> 15:18.699
You filled up the whole trunk!

15:18.773 --> 15:19.899
That's bass, baby!

15:20.975 --> 15:22.340
Oh, my eardrums!

15:22.410 --> 15:25.902
Look at the rust coming off
the top of the roof!

15:25.980 --> 15:27.777
Oh, my God!

15:27.849 --> 15:30.340
We're gonna tear this car apart.

15:30.418 --> 15:32.352
<i>But first,
they want to spiff it up</i>

15:32.420 --> 15:35.981
with a high-speed,
pimped-out paint job.

15:36.057 --> 15:38.855
There's gonna be all
these hot-rod enthusiasts going,

15:38.926 --> 15:41.121
"That's not how you paint flames
on cars!

15:41.195 --> 15:42.423
What are you doing?!"

15:42.997 --> 15:44.988
You know what I got to say
to that?

15:46.100 --> 15:47.431
So what?

15:47.502 --> 15:48.969
<i>Just like a tattoo,</i>

15:49.036 --> 15:52.301
it's more about the bad-boy
attitude than the art...

15:53.040 --> 15:55.099
...until you get inside.

15:55.176 --> 15:58.009
You know, some people
have a hula girl

15:58.079 --> 16:01.480
or a Chihuahua bobblehead
on their dashboard.

16:01.549 --> 16:02.948
<i>We have us.</i>

16:03.017 --> 16:05.485
<i>Yeah,
not quite the gangster image,</i>

16:05.553 --> 16:07.384
but they should be
good indicators

16:07.455 --> 16:10.822
of the turbulence caused
by that thumping bass.

16:13.628 --> 16:15.687
Pimped, prepped, and pumped

16:15.763 --> 16:18.027
with a trunk full
of high-grade hardware,

16:18.099 --> 16:22.195
the Shark rolls up for
its first-ever rifle recital.

16:22.270 --> 16:25.103
If all goes to plan,
there won't be an encore.

16:25.173 --> 16:26.640
Tory and Grant were kind enough

16:26.707 --> 16:28.868
to test all of the SKS rifles
for us

16:28.943 --> 16:30.808
and make sure
that they all work properly.

16:35.116 --> 16:38.176
Now we're at the Alameda County
sheriff's bomb range.

16:38.252 --> 16:40.379
We love this place
because it's a wide-open space

16:40.454 --> 16:42.786
where we don't have neighbors
to complain about the noise

16:42.857 --> 16:44.415
and we can shoot all the guns
we want.

16:44.492 --> 16:47.222
All right, so we've amassed
our gangster arsenal.

16:47.295 --> 16:48.227
We have our blanks,

16:48.296 --> 16:50.730
but, as we know, we need to
treat this like live ammunition.

16:50.798 --> 16:53.232
Let's load up our guns
and get 'em in that vehicle.

16:53.301 --> 16:54.791
Sounds good to me.

16:54.869 --> 16:55.801
<i>So the rifles</i>

16:55.870 --> 16:58.202
get spread from the backseat
to the front,

16:58.272 --> 17:02.675
some close up to the speakers
and others at a distance.

17:02.743 --> 17:05.303
This is gonna serve as mission
control for our experiment.

17:05.378 --> 17:06.710
We have a portable music player

17:06.781 --> 17:08.510
with all
our test tones preloaded.

17:08.583 --> 17:11.450
We've also got a frequency
generator and an oscilloscope

17:11.519 --> 17:14.715
so we can dial in any specific
frequencies we want to test.

17:14.789 --> 17:16.415
Inside the car,
there's a microphone

17:16.490 --> 17:19.789
that's connected to the spectrum
analyzer and dB SPL meter.

17:19.859 --> 17:21.452
And that will tell us
not only the frequency

17:21.529 --> 17:23.258
but also how loud it is.

17:23.330 --> 17:25.492
And finally,
and perhaps most importantly,

17:25.566 --> 17:26.828
there's a live video feed

17:26.901 --> 17:29.062
to tell us if any of the guns
have gone off

17:29.136 --> 17:31.127
as a result of our sound.

17:31.205 --> 17:34.038
<i>The sound won't be
music as we know it,</i>

17:34.108 --> 17:37.373
but a series of tones
designed to test and push

17:37.445 --> 17:39.436
the acoustic limits
of the system

17:39.513 --> 17:41.310
and maybe fire those guns.

17:41.382 --> 17:44.374
All right. This is gonna be
a low-frequency sweep

17:44.452 --> 17:48.616
starting at 20 hertz
at 95 dB SPL.

17:48.689 --> 17:50.520
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.785
Here we go.

17:53.427 --> 17:54.826
<i>To keep it simple,</i>

17:54.895 --> 17:57.056
hertz indicates the pitch
of a note,

17:57.131 --> 17:59.326
and decibels measure the volume.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.233
95 decibels is roughly as loud

18:02.303 --> 18:04.635
as a motorcycle
revving its engine.

18:04.705 --> 18:09.301
So far, not one round
has fired off.

18:09.377 --> 18:11.242
We're not all the way
through the sweep yet.

18:14.515 --> 18:16.142
<i>But the signs aren't good.</i>

18:16.217 --> 18:21.211
The bobbleheads are barely
bobbling, so we'll change tack.

18:21.289 --> 18:23.257
All right, next I got a tone
that alternates...

18:23.324 --> 18:25.656
wee, woo, wee, woo.

18:25.726 --> 18:29.184
Yeah, we want to see that pin
fire off one of these bullets.

18:29.263 --> 18:30.992
- All right, you guys ready?
- Ready.

18:31.065 --> 18:32.532
Crank it up, Grant.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.600
<i>If this works,</i>

18:34.669 --> 18:38.002
they can expect to hear
multiple gunshots at any moment.

18:38.072 --> 18:39.198
Is that it?

18:39.273 --> 18:40.570
You see anything?

18:42.710 --> 18:44.109
Okay.

18:44.178 --> 18:46.339
Come on.
Let's make that car vibrate.

18:46.414 --> 18:48.746
Not one round has gone off yet.

18:48.816 --> 18:49.874
Not one wiggle.

18:49.950 --> 18:52.043
I mean,
the gun's not even shaking.

18:52.119 --> 18:54.610
Okay, so that didn't work.
What would be the next step?

18:54.689 --> 18:56.179
- Louder.
- Louder. I like that.

18:56.257 --> 18:57.554
Let's go louder.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.684
<i>It's time to raise the stakes.</i>

18:59.760 --> 19:04.493
Grant cranks the decibels
up to an ear-shattering 130.

19:04.565 --> 19:07.033
That's close to the level
of a jet engine

19:07.101 --> 19:10.332
as heard
from just 100 feet away.

19:10.404 --> 19:11.632
There you go.

19:11.706 --> 19:13.196
- Whoa!
- That's what I'm talking about.

19:13.274 --> 19:15.037
Look at those speakers.
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

19:15.109 --> 19:17.543
Look, the gun
is actually vibrating.

19:17.611 --> 19:20.011
Well, no, no. It's
the camera that's vibrating.

19:20.081 --> 19:21.013
- Whoa!
- Oh!

19:21.082 --> 19:23.710
There's dust and everything
getting knocked all around!

19:23.784 --> 19:25.718
It's crazy!

19:25.786 --> 19:26.718
Whoa!

19:26.787 --> 19:28.652
Oh, my God.
The camera cut out!

19:28.723 --> 19:30.247
- We lost image.
- Oh, no!

19:30.958 --> 19:32.653
<i>Seems like everything's busted</i>

19:32.727 --> 19:34.319
but the guns.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.631
Still, Grant sees
a little room to maneuver.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.327
For all these tests,
the guns have been horizontal,

19:41.402 --> 19:43.063
on the various parts of the car.

19:43.137 --> 19:45.731
Now what we're gonna do
is change their orientation,

19:45.806 --> 19:48.172
so instead of being horizontal,
they'll be vertical,

19:48.242 --> 19:49.766
and that way,
we hope that the pins

19:49.844 --> 19:51.368
will be in a better position

19:51.445 --> 19:54.573
to set off these blanks
and, hopefully, get a result.

19:54.648 --> 19:57.173
<i>Grant's enlisting
the force of gravity</i>

19:57.251 --> 19:59.185
to help dislodge those pins.

19:59.253 --> 20:02.188
It might not help,
but it sure won't hurt.

20:03.290 --> 20:05.724
You know, if this doesn't
do it, I don't know what will.

20:05.793 --> 20:07.090
Well, it's definitely working.

20:07.161 --> 20:09.527
You can see that speaker
just vibrating.

20:09.597 --> 20:11.360
Wow, look at that gun.
The gun looks...

20:11.432 --> 20:12.763
The gun's shaking!

20:12.833 --> 20:13.800
Yeah, I think it...

20:13.868 --> 20:15.859
Heck, yeah!

20:15.936 --> 20:17.494
Come on.
Go off!

20:17.571 --> 20:19.505
Fire off!
Shoot that gun.

20:19.573 --> 20:21.700
There's a lot happening
in there.

20:21.776 --> 20:22.800
Gosh!

20:22.877 --> 20:24.344
Still not firing.

20:24.412 --> 20:25.538
<i>But once again,</i>

20:25.613 --> 20:28.309
none of the SKS shooters
go bang.

20:28.382 --> 20:31.510
Mind you, there was
some collateral damage.

20:31.585 --> 20:33.143
And this stereo system
was crazy.

20:33.220 --> 20:35.484
I mean, it was vibrating
the entire car,

20:35.556 --> 20:38.047
so much that it actually
bust the gas line.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.387
It's now leaking fuel.

20:39.460 --> 20:40.427
So this car is done.

20:40.494 --> 20:42.257
But that doesn't mean
the myth is done.

20:42.329 --> 20:45.560
It just means we got to find out
if this is even possible.

20:49.837 --> 20:51.930
<i>Now to investigate one more way</i>

20:52.006 --> 20:53.974
you can hurt yourself
with a handgun.

20:55.976 --> 20:56.908
What you got there?

20:56.977 --> 20:58.569
This?

20:58.646 --> 21:01.376
This is
a pretty grisly depiction

21:01.449 --> 21:03.883
of the dangers
of mishandling a firearm.

21:03.951 --> 21:05.714
You mean like
when you shoot yourself?

21:05.786 --> 21:08.084
No.
Merely by having a poor grip.

21:08.155 --> 21:09.952
Check this out.

21:10.524 --> 21:12.355
That's nasty.

21:12.426 --> 21:14.621
<i>The severed thumb is so nasty,</i>

21:14.695 --> 21:16.458
we can't show it on TV.

21:16.530 --> 21:20.796
It's a graphic myth, so
here's the tale in graphic form.

21:20.868 --> 21:23.632
This beast of a sidearm
is a hunting pistol

21:23.704 --> 21:26.002
designed to bring down big game,

21:26.073 --> 21:29.702
and some of the gas that propels
the bullet also escapes

21:29.777 --> 21:33.076
between the back of the barrel
and the front of the cylinder.

21:33.147 --> 21:34.910
And therein lies the myth.

21:34.982 --> 21:38.611
If you have a digit in the wrong
place at the right time,

21:38.686 --> 21:42.520
the force of the blast
could blow your thumb clean off.

21:42.590 --> 21:43.887
I'm having a hard time believing

21:43.958 --> 21:47.291
that this could happen
just from misfingering a gun.

21:47.361 --> 21:50.387
Well, that is
what we have to figure out.

21:50.464 --> 21:51.624
Okay.

21:51.699 --> 21:53.166
<i>Out on the range,</i>

21:53.234 --> 21:58.069
gunsmith Frank Tabor has brought
along the cannon in question.

21:58.572 --> 21:59.903
So, Frank,
according to the myth,

21:59.974 --> 22:02.204
the guy lost his thumb
'cause he held it like this.

22:02.276 --> 22:04.244
Do you see any immediate
problems with that?

22:04.311 --> 22:07.303
Oh, yeah. You have that gap
between the cylinder and barrel.

22:07.381 --> 22:09.212
When you've got a
2,300-foot-per-second cartridge,

22:09.283 --> 22:11.046
there's a lot of gases,
and it comes out that

22:11.118 --> 22:12.244
just like a cutting torch.

22:12.319 --> 22:14.048
So you think there could be
some real damage.

22:14.121 --> 22:15.247
Oh, yes.

22:15.823 --> 22:18.087
<i>Adam sets Jamie a tasty target</i>

22:18.158 --> 22:21.184
to test out the weapon
on high-speed video.

22:21.795 --> 22:23.956
Frank slips one in the chamber,

22:24.031 --> 22:27.626
and Dirty Jamie
lines up a clean shot.

22:33.674 --> 22:35.767
Wow.
That was something!

22:35.843 --> 22:37.640
That takes care
of your watermelon problem.

22:39.313 --> 22:41.747
<i>It's another notch
on Jamie's belt</i>

22:41.815 --> 22:43.908
of dead fruit and vegetables,

22:43.984 --> 22:46.544
but he did get a feel
for the firearm.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.611
That gun has a heck of a kick.

22:48.689 --> 22:52.557
Now, I have to be honest, I was
a little afraid of it at first,

22:52.626 --> 22:54.025
thinking that it was gonna,

22:54.094 --> 22:55.584
like, hit me in the head
afterwards.

22:55.663 --> 22:59.929
So, I can kind of see how
somebody might want to grab it

23:00.000 --> 23:02.901
in an unusual way to make sure
they had ahold of it.

23:02.970 --> 23:05.495
<i>Now it's Adam's turn
to take a shot,</i>

23:05.573 --> 23:08.565
feel the force,
and maybe make a prediction.

23:08.642 --> 23:10.576
It's not
that I'm lactose-intolerant,

23:10.644 --> 23:14.136
but if milk gets in my way, I'm
gonna take care of the problem.

23:14.214 --> 23:15.442
Cocking.

23:20.254 --> 23:24.691
<i>That's one expiration
date that was way off the mark.</i>

23:24.758 --> 23:25.952
The high-speed camera remains

23:26.026 --> 23:27.459
one of my favorite tools
on the show.

23:27.528 --> 23:30.258
If you look really closely at
the close-up of the gun firing,

23:30.331 --> 23:33.732
you can clearly see gases
shooting out of the space

23:33.801 --> 23:36.133
between the cylinder
and the barrel.

23:36.203 --> 23:39.900
This is where we'll be looking
for damaging amounts of energy.

23:40.474 --> 23:43.375
<i>If the story behind
the gruesome photo is true,</i>

23:43.444 --> 23:45.708
the man's left thumb went south

23:45.779 --> 23:48.270
due to a clumsy grip
across the cylinder.

23:48.349 --> 23:50.146
But after handling the hardware,

23:50.217 --> 23:53.618
Adam's best bet
is a thumbs-down.

23:53.687 --> 23:55.552
While it's
an impressive amount of gas

23:55.623 --> 23:58.023
you can see coming out
of the gun on the high speed,

23:58.092 --> 24:00.686
I still don't feel like
it's gonna sever a finger.

24:01.629 --> 24:05.156
<i>Well, they've got the
gun, the bullets, and the venue.</i>

24:05.232 --> 24:08.759
All they need now
is a disposable digit.

24:17.011 --> 24:20.503
All efforts to fire five rifles
via the vibrations

24:20.581 --> 24:22.208
from an upscale car stereo

24:22.282 --> 24:26.082
have failed to end
in a single gunshot.

24:26.153 --> 24:28.951
You know, if this doesn't do it,
I don't know what will.

24:29.023 --> 24:31.082
<i>So the next-to-last resort</i>

24:31.158 --> 24:33.092
is a visit to Meyer Sound.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.254
These audio experts
already helped us prove

24:36.330 --> 24:39.265
that sound alone can't make you
lose your bowel control...

24:39.333 --> 24:42.666
...just be like "Pbht!"
all over myself.

24:42.736 --> 24:46.433
<i>...and that
the human voice can break glass.</i>

24:47.508 --> 24:49.635
Yay!
I did it!

24:49.710 --> 24:52.008
But today, we've brought
our rifles to them

24:52.079 --> 24:54.980
to see if they can help us
figure out a sweet spot,

24:55.049 --> 24:56.607
a special frequency,

24:56.684 --> 24:58.982
that will cause the SKS rifle
to discharge.

24:59.053 --> 24:59.712
SKS.

24:59.787 --> 25:01.880
<i>Here to help is Roger Schwenke,</i>

25:01.955 --> 25:04.947
and once he knows
what the myth entails...

25:05.025 --> 25:08.722
Well, if it's the firing pin
that's unique about this gun,

25:08.796 --> 25:12.163
then let's isolate that
and see what happens to it.

25:12.232 --> 25:14.029
- Okay.
- Great.

25:14.101 --> 25:16.365
<i>So Tory strips out the pin,</i>

25:16.437 --> 25:19.235
and Roger opens
the test chamber.

25:19.306 --> 25:21.069
So, resonant frequency
is the frequency

25:21.141 --> 25:23.268
at which an object
will begin to vibrate

25:23.343 --> 25:25.675
in excess of the energy
that you put into it.

25:25.746 --> 25:27.407
For example, with our

25:27.481 --> 25:30.075
"trying to break a wineglass
with your voice" experiment.

25:30.150 --> 25:32.584
At many different frequencies,
a wineglass vibrates,

25:32.653 --> 25:36.111
but at one specific frequency,
it begins to vibrate a lot

25:36.190 --> 25:37.782
and eventually shatters.

25:37.858 --> 25:40.019
That is what we're looking for
in our firing pin,

25:40.094 --> 25:41.152
and if we find that,

25:41.228 --> 25:44.322
then there's a chance
this gun just might go off.

25:44.398 --> 25:46.559
Do it.
Do it now.

25:47.134 --> 25:50.035
<i>So Roger fills
the chamber with pink noise.</i>

25:50.104 --> 25:52.902
That's a whole range
of different frequencies

25:52.973 --> 25:54.770
blasted out together.

25:54.842 --> 25:56.469
It's like an earthquake.

25:56.543 --> 26:01.071
<i>And the volume's
cranked way up to 150 decibels.</i>

26:01.148 --> 26:02.342
And you see the speaker moving,

26:02.416 --> 26:03.644
and it looks like
it's vibrating,

26:03.717 --> 26:05.082
but the pin doesn't
look like it's separate.

26:05.152 --> 26:07.052
Yeah, it looks like
the whole mechanism's moving,

26:07.121 --> 26:08.452
but the pin is not
going up and down.

26:08.522 --> 26:11.821
Yeah.
Still a little hard to tell.

26:11.892 --> 26:14.019
What is
the accelerometer reading?

26:15.162 --> 26:17.426
It's responding about
the same at all frequencies.

26:17.498 --> 26:18.658
What does that mean for us?

26:18.732 --> 26:19.756
Well, it's not resonating.

26:19.833 --> 26:21.733
It's moving,
but it's not resonating

26:21.802 --> 26:23.895
at any one particular frequency.

26:23.971 --> 26:26.599
<i>The pin hasn't moved
inside the housing.</i>

26:26.673 --> 26:28.698
That's good news
for the Russian mob

26:28.776 --> 26:30.767
and a kick in the pants
for the myth.

26:30.844 --> 26:34.803
But maybe testing the pin alone
wasn't the best plan.

26:34.882 --> 26:36.247
So...

26:36.316 --> 26:37.578
I put the gun back together.

26:37.651 --> 26:39.516
We've loaded it with the blank.

26:39.586 --> 26:42.248
I have the gun pointing
nose down with the safety off.

26:42.322 --> 26:44.620
That way, it gives us
the best possible chance

26:44.691 --> 26:46.921
for this gun to go off
accidentally.

26:46.994 --> 26:48.222
Okay, hit it, Roger.

26:48.295 --> 26:49.455
Bring on the noise.

26:51.031 --> 26:52.760
That is menacing.

26:53.433 --> 26:55.025
And this is with the safety off,

26:55.102 --> 26:56.831
so it's giving it
the best possible chance.

26:56.904 --> 26:58.462
But still, it's not firing.

26:58.539 --> 26:59.972
Yeah, if this happens at all,

27:00.040 --> 27:03.168
it should happen fairly quickly,
and it's not happening.

27:04.444 --> 27:06.173
<i>So Roger pulls the plug.</i>

27:06.246 --> 27:09.409
The resonant frequency theory
fails to fire.

27:09.483 --> 27:10.950
But if you think it's over,

27:11.018 --> 27:13.418
if you truly believe
we'll end this myth

27:13.487 --> 27:17.890
with a shameful shudder,
you so don't know this show.

27:18.392 --> 27:20.553
This myth is
all about escaping gases,

27:20.627 --> 27:23.596
some of which propel the bullet
out of the barrel.

27:23.664 --> 27:26.963
But some that escape right here,
from this tiny little space

27:27.034 --> 27:28.968
between the cylinder
and the barrel...

27:29.036 --> 27:31.732
It's those that could cut
your finger off, man!

27:31.805 --> 27:33.705
<i>Or so the story goes.</i>

27:33.774 --> 27:36.038
Despite the high-speed gas shots

27:36.109 --> 27:38.771
and a shocking photo
of a severed thumb,

27:38.846 --> 27:42.282
Adam thinks this myth
is, well, a myth.

27:42.883 --> 27:45.374
But Jamie begs to differ.

27:45.452 --> 27:47.010
When I first heard
about this story,

27:47.087 --> 27:49.920
I wasn't so sure that a revolver
would be capable

27:49.990 --> 27:52.823
of blowing your thumb off
through the side like that.

27:52.893 --> 27:55.919
But having reviewed
the high-speed footage,

27:55.996 --> 27:57.520
I kind of think it will.

27:57.598 --> 27:59.828
<i>The gun is
firmly secured in a clamp</i>

27:59.900 --> 28:02.368
that's screwed down tight
to the benchtop.

28:02.436 --> 28:04.927
Now all they need
is a stunt thumb.

28:05.906 --> 28:07.703
If you think
these look gruesome,

28:07.774 --> 28:08.900
you don't know the half of it.

28:08.976 --> 28:11.069
But the best way to tell you
how these are made

28:11.144 --> 28:12.975
<i>is to show you
how they were made.</i>

28:13.046 --> 28:15.844
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.042
<i>Faced with the task</i>

28:17.117 --> 28:20.917
of replicating that miracle
of evolution, the human hand,

28:20.988 --> 28:23.889
the Mythbusters' first thoughts
naturally turned

28:23.957 --> 28:25.117
to dead chickens.

28:25.192 --> 28:27.251
I touched this chicken
before I touched anything else.

28:27.327 --> 28:28.726
You want to take the meat home?

28:28.795 --> 28:31.127
<i>Adam's stripped
a whole cooked bird...</i>

28:31.198 --> 28:33.257
not for the meat,
but for the bones.

28:33.333 --> 28:35.801
He traces a template
over his left hand

28:35.869 --> 28:39.396
and even marks the three joints
in each finger.

28:39.473 --> 28:41.668
I managed to get
almost all the bones I need

28:41.742 --> 28:44.142
out of a single
rotisserie chicken.

28:44.211 --> 28:46.873
<i>Jamie's building
his own version of a stunt hand,</i>

28:46.947 --> 28:49.313
also made
entirely from poultry pieces.

28:51.418 --> 28:55.047
And while Adam sutures
a carefully crafted left thumb,

28:55.122 --> 28:59.821
Dr. Hynenstein shows he's lost
all sense of proportion.

28:59.893 --> 29:01.520
It's actually the left hand.

29:01.595 --> 29:03.825
You know, that's the thumb
and the four fingers,

29:03.897 --> 29:07.458
and I've picked them so that
they're the correct lengths

29:07.534 --> 29:08.626
and everything.

29:08.702 --> 29:09.896
Shall we have a show of hands?

29:13.640 --> 29:14.572
Oh, no.

29:14.641 --> 29:16.131
High five!

29:18.879 --> 29:20.676
<i>As the dominant hand,</i>

29:20.747 --> 29:23.477
Jamie's massive mitt
of chicken meat

29:23.550 --> 29:25.108
gets to take the first shot.

29:25.185 --> 29:27.415
It's wired securely
onto the gun butt,

29:27.487 --> 29:29.717
with care taken
to place the thumb

29:29.790 --> 29:34.659
<i>in precisely the right...
or, rather, the wrong position.</i>

29:34.728 --> 29:36.093
- I love it.
- All right, let's do it.

29:36.163 --> 29:38.393
<i>Frank loads the gun
and cocks it.</i>

29:38.465 --> 29:40.433
With the trigger
tied to a string,

29:40.500 --> 29:42.525
all Jamie has to do
is pull it.

29:42.602 --> 29:45.230
The gun is hot.
You're good to go.

29:45.305 --> 29:50.140
"Handgun Horror" in 3, 2, 1!

29:52.312 --> 29:53.939
Ah.

29:54.014 --> 29:55.845
No decapitation.

29:55.916 --> 29:58.908
Definitely damage,
but, yeah, it's still there.

29:58.986 --> 30:01.147
I think that your drumstick bone
is way too robust

30:01.221 --> 30:02.415
for a human hand.

30:02.489 --> 30:04.980
What I see on the chicken hand
and what I see on the high speed

30:05.058 --> 30:06.548
is that the gases
are coming out,

30:06.626 --> 30:08.059
and they're definitely
having an effect.

30:08.128 --> 30:10.119
I have no doubt
you'd be burned by this,

30:10.197 --> 30:11.994
but I don't see
any decapitation.

30:12.065 --> 30:15.034
<i>Lucky Jamie's skin
is thicker than the chicken's.</i>

30:15.102 --> 30:19.004
He's even prepared
to offer some... sage advice.

30:19.072 --> 30:21.870
The major amount of gas is right
out through the middle there.

30:21.942 --> 30:22.374
Okay.

30:22.442 --> 30:24.501
So if you want to be sure
it cuts it off,

30:24.578 --> 30:26.205
- that's where to put it.
- All right.

30:26.279 --> 30:26.973
Here we go!

30:27.047 --> 30:29.982
Adam's anatomically accurate
avian appendage

30:30.050 --> 30:32.575
in 3, 2, 1!

30:34.087 --> 30:37.079
<i>To the naked eye,
this looks like real damage.</i>

30:37.157 --> 30:40.058
Now for the expert analysis.

30:40.127 --> 30:41.059
Oh!

30:41.128 --> 30:42.220
Ohh!

30:42.295 --> 30:43.853
Ohh!

30:43.930 --> 30:45.420
Ohh!

30:45.499 --> 30:47.364
<i>O- kay!</i>

30:47.434 --> 30:49.095
Wow!

30:49.169 --> 30:50.500
<i>What Adam means to say is,</i>

30:50.570 --> 30:52.538
they've shredded
one chicken finger

30:52.606 --> 30:54.073
and shattered another.

30:54.141 --> 30:56.268
This one is torn to shreds.

30:56.343 --> 30:57.469
And what about that one?

30:57.544 --> 30:59.774
That is cut
almost clean through.

31:00.347 --> 31:01.473
Wow!

31:01.548 --> 31:03.311
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

31:03.383 --> 31:05.874
Adam's carefully constructed
chicken hand

31:05.952 --> 31:09.444
had the right-sized bones
to simulate human fingers.

31:09.523 --> 31:13.482
They even had three joints,
right where they're meant to be.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.857
That is totally clear.

31:14.928 --> 31:17.795
Those gases have cut
through that finger absolutely.

31:17.864 --> 31:19.354
That is one
of the more gruesome things

31:19.433 --> 31:21.560
we've ever filmed on high speed.

31:21.635 --> 31:23.796
<i>Well, it doesn't get any more
definitive than that.</i>

31:23.870 --> 31:25.497
Nope.
It's confirmed.

31:25.572 --> 31:27.767
Totally confirmed.

31:27.841 --> 31:29.433
Well, let that be
a lesson to you.

31:29.509 --> 31:31.272
If you've got to have
a handgun,

31:31.344 --> 31:33.335
make sure you know
how to use it.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.472
I can't believe
you can eat buffalo wings

31:35.549 --> 31:36.948
so quickly after that.

31:37.017 --> 31:39.542
What do you mean? I'm gonna
cook up Frankenhand for dinner.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.027
<i>After failing to trigger</i>

31:48.095 --> 31:52.532
these unstable Russian rifles
with a red-hot car stereo...

31:52.599 --> 31:54.499
Not one round has gone off yet.

31:54.568 --> 31:55.762
<i>...Kari, Tory, and Grant</i>

31:55.836 --> 31:57.770
take one last shot at this myth

31:57.838 --> 32:01.501
with a truck that's tailor-made
to pump up the volume.

32:01.575 --> 32:04.009
Now I know this car didn't do
what we needed,

32:04.077 --> 32:07.604
but I think I have some renewed
confidence in our back-up plan.

32:07.681 --> 32:09.308
Oh, my God!

32:09.382 --> 32:12.078
That is loud out here!
How's it inside?

32:12.152 --> 32:14.643
- Ridiculous.
- What?!

32:15.255 --> 32:18.816
<i>So far, they've pushed
the decibels way up to 150,</i>

32:18.892 --> 32:22.020
but this car peaks at 160.

32:22.095 --> 32:25.258
That's actually louder than
the gunshots they hope to hear.

32:25.332 --> 32:26.959
Now, handling
the mid-bass frequencies,

32:27.033 --> 32:30.127
we've got four 10-inch
Thunder8500 subwoofers

32:30.203 --> 32:31.795
in a custom fiberglass
enclosure.

32:31.872 --> 32:34.773
But that's not all,
because the real meat

32:34.841 --> 32:37.833
are these two 22-inch
JackHammer subwoofers.

32:37.911 --> 32:40.505
Each subwoofer
has two amplifiers,

32:40.580 --> 32:43.845
for a total of 17,200 watts.

32:43.917 --> 32:46.750
If you're talking about
sound-pressure level in a car,

32:46.820 --> 32:47.980
this is it.

32:48.054 --> 32:51.387
<i>Once again, the guns
are armed with blank cartridges</i>

32:51.458 --> 32:53.016
and spread around the car.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.891
We're ready to go.
The guns are loaded.

32:55.962 --> 32:56.929
The safeties are off to give us

32:56.997 --> 32:58.897
the best possible chance
for this to work.

32:58.965 --> 33:01.798
<i>But Kari seems a little gun-shy.</i>

33:01.868 --> 33:03.335
I'm having some serious doubts

33:03.403 --> 33:06.463
that something even as powerful
as the SPL car's gonna do it.

33:06.540 --> 33:09.338
But I would really, really like
to be proven wrong here.

33:09.409 --> 33:11.309
<i>The sound system's
been preloaded</i>

33:11.378 --> 33:13.039
with three different
test tracks.

33:13.113 --> 33:15.274
The first is a bass sweep,

33:15.348 --> 33:18.283
and, remember,
this is 30 decibels higher

33:18.351 --> 33:20.615
than anything they tried
in the Great White.

33:20.687 --> 33:22.279
Starting the sweep.

33:23.423 --> 33:25.550
Wow. That thing is shaking
like nuts.

33:25.625 --> 33:27.024
Oh, my God.

33:27.694 --> 33:31.152
<i>But the one sound
they're not hearing is gunfire.</i>

33:31.231 --> 33:34.462
Time to try
the alternating tones.

33:34.534 --> 33:35.831
Whoa.

33:35.902 --> 33:37.802
That's it.

33:37.871 --> 33:40.396
Look what it's doing
to the camera.

33:41.074 --> 33:45.636
Things are really moving,
but no discharge yet.

33:45.712 --> 33:48.476
No.
159.5?!

33:48.548 --> 33:49.981
Yeah!

33:50.050 --> 33:53.383
And this is way crazier than
a gangster vehicle would have.

33:53.453 --> 33:55.444
There's no way a person
could be sitting in there

33:55.522 --> 33:56.955
and listening comfortably.

33:57.023 --> 33:58.422
Absolutely.

33:58.491 --> 34:01.619
<i>The last track
is loosely called "Music. "</i>

34:01.695 --> 34:05.791
It's unlikely to top the charts,
but it's seriously loud.

34:05.865 --> 34:07.662
Still no gunshots.

34:07.734 --> 34:09.702
But you can see the speakers
moving like crazy,

34:09.768 --> 34:13.603
and all the dust in the car
is blowing, as if it's just air.

34:14.274 --> 34:17.038
I hope that's dust.
That's not smoke, is it?

34:17.110 --> 34:18.737
It looks like smoke.

34:18.812 --> 34:19.608
Do you think...

34:19.679 --> 34:21.271
No, we would have heard
a gunshot.

34:21.348 --> 34:22.871
- You think?
- I don't know.

34:22.949 --> 34:24.610
You know what?
It's starting to smoke.

34:24.684 --> 34:26.447
Is that normal?

34:26.518 --> 34:28.487
<i>No, it's not.</i>

34:28.554 --> 34:31.524
This is the last
and loudest of the tests,

34:31.591 --> 34:34.321
and everyone's hoping
a gun's gone off.

34:34.393 --> 34:35.418
So, we thought maybe...

34:35.495 --> 34:37.827
Maybe there's a possibility
we didn't hear the discharge,

34:37.897 --> 34:41.628
maybe a gun went off, and it's
just filling the car with smoke.

34:41.701 --> 34:42.292
Oh.

34:42.369 --> 34:44.963
No, that smells
like electrical smoke.

34:45.038 --> 34:47.029
That doesn't smell like gunfire.

34:47.107 --> 34:49.974
<i>In fact, the smoke
came from quickly heated resin</i>

34:50.043 --> 34:50.975
in the woofers.

34:51.043 --> 34:53.774
It normally cures
in the first few months,

34:53.847 --> 34:58.045
but we've pushed a brand-new
speaker way too hard.

34:58.118 --> 35:01.212
The system's fine,
but the myth has run its course.

35:01.288 --> 35:04.519
All that remains
is to check the weapons.

35:04.591 --> 35:06.821
All right,
this is the last gun.

35:08.261 --> 35:09.751
Didn't discharge.

35:09.829 --> 35:11.888
This is why we can
never have anything nice.

35:11.965 --> 35:13.523
I'm calling this one busted.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.433
Yeah, I mean, we threw
a massive amount of sound at it,

35:16.503 --> 35:17.834
and the gun still didn't go off.

35:17.904 --> 35:19.804
- Busted.
- Yeah, busted.

35:19.873 --> 35:21.932
Dang, I wanted this one to work!

35:26.813 --> 35:28.974
Ah, it's beautiful!

35:31.651 --> 35:34.381
<i>They're using 10 times the ice</i>

35:34.454 --> 35:37.150
and 10 times the thermite.

35:37.223 --> 35:38.383
'Cause this thing right here

35:38.458 --> 35:41.188
is a little bit
more macho going on here,

35:41.261 --> 35:43.195
I'm not gonna use a torch
to ignite it.

35:43.263 --> 35:46.357
I'm gonna use these things,
which are fuse igniters,

35:46.433 --> 35:48.697
and they work kind of like so.

35:48.768 --> 35:51.066
And then I'm gonna leave.

35:51.137 --> 35:52.035
Quickly.

35:53.873 --> 35:56.569
All right, Jamie. We are all
in place in the bunker.

35:56.643 --> 35:59.237
You may fire when ready, sir.

35:59.312 --> 36:04.477
Supersized thermite
in 3, 2, 1...

36:07.153 --> 36:09.053
<i>Now, here's the thing
about thermite.</i>

36:09.122 --> 36:12.319
Being volatile means
it's also unpredictable.

36:12.392 --> 36:17.557
And this tub full of red powder
is taking its own sweet time.

36:17.630 --> 36:19.257
Thermite's kind of, uh...

36:19.332 --> 36:20.356
I hate thermite.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.025
<i>But when it works...</i>

36:23.103 --> 36:25.162
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

36:26.740 --> 36:28.640
<i>...there's nothing like it.</i>

36:29.776 --> 36:31.300
Wow!

36:33.346 --> 36:35.075
I'm glad
we didn't approach that.

36:35.148 --> 36:36.638
Wow!

36:36.716 --> 36:38.445
There is nothing left.

36:38.518 --> 36:39.951
No.

36:40.019 --> 36:41.646
That was a thunk.

36:42.655 --> 36:43.917
Wow!

36:43.990 --> 36:46.151
It's like
somebody blew up an igloo.

36:46.226 --> 36:47.750
Look at this debris field.

36:47.827 --> 36:50.489
Explosives
that move really quickly

36:50.563 --> 36:52.394
tend to rip and tear things.

36:52.465 --> 36:55.229
Explosives that move slowly
move things.

36:55.301 --> 36:56.563
And that's what this did.

36:56.636 --> 36:59.764
It moved slowly
but very powerfully,

36:59.839 --> 37:04.071
and it just spread all this ice
all over the field here.

37:04.144 --> 37:06.339
I think we're working
on a pretty good formula here.

37:06.413 --> 37:07.812
You see something crazy
on the Internet

37:07.881 --> 37:08.870
and want to know if it's true.

37:08.948 --> 37:11.143
So you send it to us,
we try it out and find out,

37:11.217 --> 37:12.206
yes, it's true!

37:12.285 --> 37:13.877
This is what we do
on "Mythbusters. "

37:13.953 --> 37:16.820
We blow it up
so you don't have to.

37:23.430 --> 37:26.160
<i>Tory, Grant, and Kari
have busted the myth</i>

37:26.232 --> 37:28.928
that vibrations
from a souped-up car stereo

37:29.002 --> 37:31.562
triggered
a bunch of dodgy rifles.

37:31.638 --> 37:35.096
But Tory's found a related myth
that's easy to test

37:35.175 --> 37:38.076
and guaranteed to end
with a bang.

37:38.144 --> 37:39.611
Well, we've come a long way

37:39.679 --> 37:42.307
accidentally setting off
one of these SKS rifles,

37:42.382 --> 37:43.542
but we're not done yet.

37:43.616 --> 37:45.243
There's one other thing
I want to try.

37:45.318 --> 37:46.114
What's that?

37:46.186 --> 37:47.448
Apparently,
during this turf war,

37:47.520 --> 37:49.249
a bomb goes off
in a gangster's house

37:49.322 --> 37:51.017
and wipes out his entire gang.

37:51.090 --> 37:53.058
Now, after the explosion,
the police go through the debris

37:53.126 --> 37:56.527
and find these SKS rifles
with empty shells next to them.

37:56.596 --> 37:59.724
However, nobody in
the neighborhood heard gunshots

37:59.799 --> 38:02.097
before or after the explosion.

38:02.168 --> 38:05.365
So the idea is that the
shock wave set off the weapons.

38:05.438 --> 38:07.303
Apparently so.

38:07.373 --> 38:10.035
<i>The guys know
that a springless SKS</i>

38:10.109 --> 38:12.509
could be seen as an accident
waiting to happen.

38:12.579 --> 38:16.538
But where sound waves failed
to set the firing pin aquiver,

38:16.616 --> 38:20.143
a high-explosive shock wave
might do the trick.

38:20.220 --> 38:22.814
To find out, they build
a mock living room

38:22.889 --> 38:25.858
and carefully place
four loaded rifles

38:25.925 --> 38:27.688
just where
you'd expect to find them.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.524
Now we're going to
deliver a special package of C-4

38:30.597 --> 38:31.529
to this scene.

38:31.598 --> 38:33.623
We're gonna be safely down
in the bunker when it goes off,

38:33.700 --> 38:35.224
and after a big explosion,

38:35.301 --> 38:37.633
we're gonna see if
the percussive force from a bomb

38:37.704 --> 38:40.172
can actually set off
any of our firearms.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.901
Either way,
we're getting destruction.

38:41.975 --> 38:44.000
We're all pretty happy
about that.

38:44.077 --> 38:46.545
Special delivery for Mr. Buster.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.475
<i>If sound waves
can set a speaker cone</i>

38:49.549 --> 38:53.076
dancing like this, just imagine
the percussive force

38:53.152 --> 38:55.313
of a high-explosive shock wave.

38:55.388 --> 38:57.549
You know the thing that's
bumming me out about this?

38:57.624 --> 38:59.990
Is we're probably gonna damage
these guns.

39:00.059 --> 39:01.390
But I guess if you want
to make omelets,

39:01.461 --> 39:02.928
you got to break a few eggs.

39:02.996 --> 39:05.863
<i>Let's hope
they finally break something.</i>

39:06.933 --> 39:11.734
J. D. saunters back to the bunker
as our guys weigh the odds.

39:11.804 --> 39:13.465
All right, quick predictions.

39:13.540 --> 39:15.440
Okay, I think if any of the guns
are gonna go off,

39:15.508 --> 39:16.566
it's the one in Buster's hand

39:16.643 --> 39:18.406
'cause I've got his finger
on the trigger.

39:18.478 --> 39:21.140
I don't think that any
of the guns are gonna go off.

39:21.214 --> 39:22.579
I don't think that this is even

39:22.649 --> 39:24.173
enough energy
to make them go off.

39:24.250 --> 39:27.777
All right, this is explosion
setting off SKS rifles.

39:27.854 --> 39:29.344
All right, Kari.
Take it away.

39:29.422 --> 39:31.822
In 3, 2, 1!

39:34.627 --> 39:36.492
Whoo!

39:36.563 --> 39:38.360
Nice!

39:38.431 --> 39:39.693
Nice one, J. D.

39:39.766 --> 39:41.666
That never gets old.

39:41.734 --> 39:44.328
<i>It's the blast
we were begging for,</i>

39:44.404 --> 39:47.840
but did it trigger
even one of the guns?

39:48.708 --> 39:51.074
Wow.
You know how to wreck a party.

39:51.144 --> 39:53.203
Now, the easy part...
finding the guns.

39:53.279 --> 39:55.873
Look, there's a hole
right where the package was.

39:55.949 --> 39:57.940
- All right, should we check 'em?
- Yeah.

39:58.551 --> 40:00.212
That one didn't go off.

40:00.286 --> 40:01.378
Let's check Buster.

40:02.121 --> 40:04.885
All right.
Show us what you got.

40:04.958 --> 40:06.016
- Okay.
- Look at that one.

40:06.092 --> 40:08.185
The safety
actually went back on.

40:08.695 --> 40:09.719
Nope.

40:09.796 --> 40:11.764
Didn't fire off.
All right.

40:11.831 --> 40:14.527
That was the one
that was in his hands

40:14.601 --> 40:15.932
with the finger on the trigger.

40:16.002 --> 40:18.994
<i>Two guns down, and two to go.</i>

40:20.907 --> 40:23.535
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

40:23.610 --> 40:26.340
The round went off!
Oh, my God!

40:26.412 --> 40:28.209
Yay!

40:28.281 --> 40:32.217
<i>It's no surprise that
a C-4 shock wave has the edge</i>

40:32.285 --> 40:36.153
on one of the world's best
and loudest car sound systems.

40:36.222 --> 40:38.213
But at least we've got a result.

40:38.291 --> 40:40.452
Last one.

40:41.494 --> 40:43.962
- Didn't go off.
- But you know what?

40:44.030 --> 40:47.557
One did, and one out of four,
I say this is plausible.

40:47.634 --> 40:51.434
Yeah, I mean, the gun fired
as a result of the explosion.

40:51.504 --> 40:52.266
Plausible.

40:52.338 --> 40:53.703
I'd buy that.
Plausible.

40:53.773 --> 40:56.207
That is crazy.
I can't believe it worked!

40:56.275 --> 40:58.436
<i>After days of disappointment,</i>

40:58.511 --> 41:00.877
this should at least
send them home happy,

41:00.947 --> 41:02.972
and the message
couldn't be clearer...

41:03.049 --> 41:07.008
It's unsafe to leave loaded guns
in exploding rooms.

41:08.305 --> 41:14.653
