WEBVTT

00:05.918 --> 00:08.269
What the hell is going on?

00:08.312 --> 00:09.966
Come on, what'd you do?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.750
I was trying to
make pancakes.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.274
What, barbecued pancakes?

00:13.317 --> 00:15.058
Jack always made
it look so easy;

00:15.102 --> 00:16.886
I thought it might be
a nice surprise.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.019
Well, it was a nice attempt
at a surprise.

00:19.062 --> 00:21.238
Jack and I had
our own traditions.

00:21.282 --> 00:22.544
You and I will make
our own, too.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.198
If you say so.
Come on,
you're gonna be

00:24.241 --> 00:26.287
late for school;
let's go, hurry up.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.810
Did you speak
to your brother today?

00:27.853 --> 00:29.986
It's 8:00 a.m., do you think
I've spoken with him yet?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.379
Well, I tried to reach him
last night,

00:31.422 --> 00:32.815
and he never got back to me.

00:32.858 --> 00:36.036
Yeah, he posted some picture
from a party last night.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.689
Party?

00:37.733 --> 00:41.258
Who the hell has a party
on a Sunday night?Beats me; ask him.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.653
You came over with the
new sergeant, right?
Yeah.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.655
He was my partner
in the 12th.

00:46.698 --> 00:49.614
He was your partner?

00:49.658 --> 00:51.181
That must've been tough.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.053
What do you mean?

00:53.096 --> 00:55.968
He's so tightly wound,
and, I mean, come on,

00:56.012 --> 00:57.100
he clearly thinks
he's the man

00:57.144 --> 00:59.102
on the account of
he's the PC's son.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.321
No.
Yeah.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.671
Well, he has to
be that way

01:02.714 --> 01:06.153
because he
inherited a mess.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.589
What "mess"?

01:07.632 --> 01:10.113
I've been with the 2-9
three years, I'm no mess.

01:10.157 --> 01:13.682
Oh, hey, that's not
what I meant, I just...

01:13.725 --> 01:16.163
Listen, is this the only
precinct you've ever been in?

01:16.206 --> 01:18.904
Yeah, why?
Well, then it's
what you know.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.123
But there are different
ways to do things.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.908
To do what?
To get more collars?

01:22.952 --> 01:25.346
No, it's not just
about making collars.

01:25.389 --> 01:26.477
It's about doing
what's best

01:26.521 --> 01:27.435
for the people in
your neighborhood.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.914
That's what I
always try to do.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.916
Well, good, then we're
gonna get along great.
Okay.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.789
Hey. Hey!

01:38.402 --> 01:39.664
MAYA: Whoa, whoa,
step away from the door!

01:43.494 --> 01:45.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.410
What are you doing?

01:46.454 --> 01:49.326
I'm sorry, it's...

01:49.370 --> 01:51.154
I'm just upset about the
lottery, it's nothing.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.721
It's nothing?
We've got you on dis con

01:52.764 --> 01:54.114
and criminal mischief already.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.941
And you were about to throw
that through the glass.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.943
No, he just lost his temper;
it's a little misunderstanding.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.336
We're good. Estamos bien.Yeah?

01:59.380 --> 02:00.990
He doesn't look so good;
so what's this beef about?

02:01.033 --> 02:03.688
No beef,
just a neighborhood thing.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.342
Yeah, well, this is
our neighborhood, too,

02:05.386 --> 02:07.910
so what's the thing?

02:07.953 --> 02:09.520
It's the lotto.

02:10.869 --> 02:14.351
Look, are you gonna walk away
and leave this man alone?

02:14.395 --> 02:15.483
I promise.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.093
That good by you?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.312
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
it's good.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.704
Estamos bien. All right, then.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.010
Get lost.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.840
"Get lost"?
What?

02:24.883 --> 02:26.755
He calmed down;
he didn't look like

02:26.798 --> 02:28.365
a danger to himself
or others.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.106
You want to put him
in the system over
a lotto ticket thing?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.369
No, I don't to put him
in the system...Take a look around.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.372
What do you see?

02:35.416 --> 02:38.288
Rubberneckers.Documentary filmmakers.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.898
You want to star
in a movie called

02:39.942 --> 02:43.250
Cops Overreacting? No, you do not.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.475
Oh, good morning,
Inspector.

02:51.519 --> 02:54.783
Inspector Kimura is here, sir.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.873
He will be
right with you.
Thank you.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.701
Congratulations
on your promotion.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.659
I appreciate that.Of course.

03:01.703 --> 03:04.706
Morning. Please.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.621
Good morning, Commissioner.

03:12.017 --> 03:14.977
Sit down.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.892
Couple more days.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.242
You want me to call you Deputy
Chief, try it on for size?

03:19.286 --> 03:20.896
Wouldn't want to jinx it, sir.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.246
Huh. Good thinking.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.639
Coffee?

03:24.682 --> 03:27.772
No, thanks.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.644
Okay. What's up?

03:29.687 --> 03:31.341
Static I'm hearing.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.908
About?

03:32.951 --> 03:34.823
Specifically, my promotion.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.477
Well, let me
stop you right there.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.218
There's always gonna be somebody

03:38.261 --> 03:40.394
who thinks they were
passed over unfairly.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.439
I'm afraid that goes
with the territory, Jane.

03:42.483 --> 03:45.268
This someone is planning
to put in his papers

03:45.312 --> 03:46.443
and file a lawsuit.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.010
And you know this how?

03:48.053 --> 03:49.272
Sources in the department

03:49.316 --> 03:51.274
and in the Captain's
Benevolent Association.

03:51.318 --> 03:54.277
About a candidate
on your short list.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.409
Named?

03:55.452 --> 03:59.195
I'd rather not say, sir.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.371
I assume the short list
was indeed short

04:01.415 --> 04:03.895
and that your sources
are even better than mine.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.507
Good thinking.

04:06.550 --> 04:10.467
As an Asian female, I don't have
much of a tribe in the NYPD,

04:10.511 --> 04:13.731
but the friends I do have
are very protective

04:13.775 --> 04:16.081
and very proactive on my behalf.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.519
I know, I'm one of them.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.651
I know.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.307
Is this, in any way,

04:24.351 --> 04:26.744
putting you off
accepting your promotion?

04:26.788 --> 04:29.704
Not in any way, sir.

04:29.747 --> 04:34.404
Good. Good.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.319
I'll look into it.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.539
Thank you, Commissioner.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.334
What do we got?One student DOA.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.596
18 years old, freshman.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.728
Kid got a name?

04:53.771 --> 04:55.207
Peter Jones.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.688
What the hell is with
these kids partying on a Sunday?

04:57.732 --> 05:00.256
They say it started as a darty,
lasted into the night.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.431
A what?
A darty.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.215
Short for "day party."

05:03.259 --> 05:04.434
Oh, my God.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.398
BAEZ: This place is disgusting;
guys actually live here?

05:11.441 --> 05:15.097
Guys actually compete to live
here, believe it or not.

05:15.140 --> 05:18.666
I had no idea there was Greek
life at Hudson University.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.538
There won't be anymore.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.584
Not after this.

05:30.199 --> 05:33.245
♪

05:53.614 --> 05:56.791
You always know you
wanted to become a cop?

05:56.834 --> 06:00.229
Growing up in the hood?
I always hated cops.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.884
Oh, well, then
why'd you become one?

06:02.927 --> 06:04.494
You know the whole

06:04.538 --> 06:05.930
"be the change you
want to see" thing?

06:05.974 --> 06:07.105
Well, uh, yeah,
I figured,

06:07.149 --> 06:08.716
if you can't beat them,
join them.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.588
What about you?

06:11.632 --> 06:14.461
Same, you know?
Growing up in the hood.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.552
Where'd you learn Spanish?

06:18.595 --> 06:20.118
Uh, well, I took it
for the job.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.033
I hated feeling
like I was deaf

06:22.077 --> 06:24.427
on so many blocks
of this city.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.342
DISPATCHER:
2-9 Charlie, you have a 24.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.909
Corner of First Street
and Avenue D,

06:27.952 --> 06:31.303
outside the bodega;
victim is Hispanic female.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.566
Caller states that
the witnesses are holding

06:32.609 --> 06:33.871
the perp at this location.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.612
That's the bodega
we just left.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.005
2-9 Charlie,
show us responding.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.754
Police! Back up! Back up.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.496
We got this.
Step aside, step aside.MAYA: Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.584
Step aside.Excuse me,
that's enough.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.499
Hey, sir, up.He just jumped her.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.717
Came out of nowhere
and just jumped her.

06:53.761 --> 06:56.459
Are you serious? After
we gave you a break?

06:56.503 --> 06:57.721
She had it coming.Get up.

06:57.765 --> 07:00.289
Come on, get up. What
are you talking about?

07:00.332 --> 07:04.467
She runs the store
with her husband.Okay, come on.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
And they both owe me money!No, turn around.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.776
No, you're the cops from before;
you're the ones

07:08.819 --> 07:11.343
who let him go the first time.He could have
killed that woman.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.563
Why don't you do
your job already, huh

07:13.607 --> 07:15.739
I want your names,
I want your badge numbers. Now.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.222
Who found the body?

07:20.265 --> 07:22.354
Those three over there.The three of them?

07:22.398 --> 07:23.617
You didn't separate them?

07:23.660 --> 07:24.661
Just alcohol poisoning.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.880
Oh, so you're an M.E. now, too?

07:25.923 --> 07:28.186
You didn't even put
a uniform with them.

07:28.230 --> 07:31.363
What the hell are
you thinking?

07:31.407 --> 07:32.843
Gentlemen, Detective Reagan.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.062
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.064
You guys friends
of the deceased?

07:36.107 --> 07:37.935
Not exactly,
but he was a pledge.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.328
So, not friends?

07:39.371 --> 07:41.286
We just met him last week.Know his name was Peter.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.114
But that's about it.So what happened?

07:43.158 --> 07:45.073
When we woke up,
we found him next to the couch.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.292
Looked like he rolled off
and hit his head.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.468
You guys haze pledges?

07:48.511 --> 07:49.730
Force them to drink,
anything like that?

07:49.773 --> 07:51.645
No, uh, we don't haze.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.995
Are any of you even over 21 yet?

07:54.038 --> 07:55.736
I am.So, you bought the alcohol?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.215
No, he brought his own.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.176
And it's not our fault that
he can't hold his liquor.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.960
Look, Officers...Detectives.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.833
Sure, Detectives. We're sorry.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.835
But this is, like,
a-a victimless crime.

08:07.878 --> 08:10.141
There's a man lying dead
on the floor in there.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.882
That's called a victim.

08:11.926 --> 08:15.146
Okay, you know what I mean--
like, we're not responsible.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.148
Mm-hmm. And how about
you in the back?

08:17.192 --> 08:19.673
You got a name?Uh, Bobby Delaney.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.283
Oh, so you can talk.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.024
Anything you'd like to add?

08:23.067 --> 08:26.201
I mean, we had a keg
and a bowl of jungle juice.Bobby, shut up.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.377
Guys, there's nothing to hide;
there's no point in lying.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.510
So, did you serve alcohol
or not?

08:30.553 --> 08:32.729
Yes, but it was off-limits
to pledges.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.036
Like I said, he brought his own.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.301
Detective, the victim's
parents are here.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.303
Danny, I can take this one.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.261
I got it. Stay with them.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.436
They know what happened?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.874
They aren't
aware he's dead.

08:46.917 --> 08:50.094
Detective Reagan.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.228
Mr. and Mrs. Jones, I hate
to tell you this, but, uh...

08:53.271 --> 08:55.578
Oh. What...?

08:55.622 --> 08:58.146
No, no, no,
no, no, no...

09:00.235 --> 09:04.456
Why

09:07.416 --> 09:10.201
ABETEMARCO:
So, how you doing, Ma?

09:10.245 --> 09:13.944
Oh, it's just a little
scratchy throat, that's all.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.380
Something going around?

09:15.424 --> 09:19.036
No, it's, um...

09:19.080 --> 09:21.343
"endoscopy."

09:21.386 --> 09:23.737
Endoscopy?Yeah, the...

09:23.780 --> 09:26.391
They stick a tube
down your throat.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.959
Yeah, I know what it is, Ma,
but why?

09:29.003 --> 09:31.483
Well, they were testing
for something else.

09:31.527 --> 09:34.312
What do you mean,
something else?

09:34.356 --> 09:37.751
Uh, well, Anthony,
everybody here is old

09:37.794 --> 09:40.275
and they have to give us
a lot of tests.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.060
And what else
have they tested you for?

09:43.104 --> 09:46.150
Oh, my, there's
so many names, uh...

09:46.194 --> 09:47.369
Okay.I don't know.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.240
I-It's stuff
that happens to you

09:49.284 --> 09:52.461
when you're my age.I understand, Ma. I understand.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.206
Uh, excuse me.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.035
Yeah, you two.

10:01.078 --> 10:04.778
We met when, uh, my ma
interviewed. I'm Anthony.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.606
Oh, of course.
I'm Mary O'Donnell,

10:06.649 --> 10:08.303
director of operations,
and this is

10:08.346 --> 10:10.044
Brian Dixon,
our attending physician.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.657
She had an endoscopy.
What for?

10:14.701 --> 10:15.919
She needed the procedure.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.312
She was experiencing
symptoms that sounded like

10:17.355 --> 10:18.922
esophagitis or even
Barrett's disease.

10:18.966 --> 10:22.099
You're comfortable now,
right, Lucille?

10:22.143 --> 10:24.885
Never better, just a little
scratchy throat.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.669
Yeah, I can't believe,
at her age,

10:26.713 --> 10:29.280
you would give her anesthesia.We gave her
a nasal endoscopy.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.891
It's quick
and we go through the nose.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.327
She was awake the entire time.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.633
And why wasn't I notified?

10:33.676 --> 10:35.635
I'm sorry, sir, but
we have, by definition,

10:35.678 --> 10:37.637
a rather fragile clientele.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.464
We can't always wait
on notifications.

10:39.508 --> 10:42.729
Besides, it was very minor, and
mostly covered by her Medicaid.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.209
But in the future,
I'll make sure to reach out.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.560
Bye-bye...Thanks.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.653
Look what you've done.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.698
What Ask questions?

10:55.742 --> 10:57.308
Like a cop.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.398
We don't need cops over here.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.706
GORMLEY:
From what I can gather,

11:03.750 --> 11:06.361
it's wagons circling around
Inspector Keith Sullivan.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.841
Whose wagons?

11:07.884 --> 11:10.234
Well, Sully's, obviously,
but some of the other guys

11:10.278 --> 11:12.497
at Firearms and Tactics
and a, and a few

11:12.541 --> 11:14.325
at the Captain's
Benevolent Association.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.371
Saying we was passed over
for affirmative action.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.764
Nothing concrete,

11:17.807 --> 11:19.940
what I'm hearing.
Could just be some guys bitching

11:19.983 --> 11:21.768
about how the old days
were better.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.813
And Sully's old enough
to know better.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.294
Those union guys can wind you up
pretty good, boss.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.644
Well, they're her
union guys, too.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.124
Listen, boss,

11:30.167 --> 11:32.300
Sullivan's old-school,
I'll give you that,

11:32.343 --> 11:34.563
but guys like him are what
built this department.

11:34.606 --> 11:35.956
And I give him credit for it,

11:35.999 --> 11:37.392
and I look
the other way sometimes,

11:37.435 --> 11:39.481
'cause that's how
you and I came up.

11:39.524 --> 11:45.052
But Jane Kimura is the best
candidate for this post, period.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.619
Hopefully, it's just some
barstool bitching

11:47.663 --> 11:48.882
that's making the rounds.

11:48.925 --> 11:49.970
Got a sec?

11:50.013 --> 11:52.233
Come in.I'm getting calls

11:52.276 --> 11:53.843
from the Times
and the Postabout

11:53.887 --> 11:55.453
an Inspector Keith Sullivan

11:55.497 --> 11:57.499
crying discrimination
over a promotion?

11:57.542 --> 12:00.937
They're gonna use the media.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.591
First time I'm hearing of it.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.592
What do they got?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.333
Very deep background.

12:05.376 --> 12:08.597
Like someone's running it up
the flagpole.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.561
BAEZ: Sounds like
a tragic accident.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.477
Drank too much, trying to
keep up with the older kids,

12:19.521 --> 12:22.567
choked on his own vomit, fell
off the couch, hit his head.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.222
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hey,
Jack, it's your dad.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.008
Look, give me a call
back, would you? Bye.

12:28.051 --> 12:32.012
That's at least five messages
in as many hours.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.753
I'm just saying.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.667
Well, I just miss him, is all.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.713
What do we got, Doc?

12:37.757 --> 12:40.150
Well, he had over three times
the legal limit of alcohol

12:40.194 --> 12:42.631
in his system when he died,
but that's not what killed him.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.415
What killed him?

12:44.459 --> 12:46.417
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.158
Could a fall off
the couch do that?

12:48.202 --> 12:50.813
Only if the couch was
about ten stories up.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.737
I understand this may be
cold comfort for you,

13:01.781 --> 13:03.913
but Peter did not
cause his own death.

13:03.957 --> 13:07.264
In fact, this is now
a homicide investigation.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.007
Who would kill a boy like Pete?

13:11.051 --> 13:13.618
We were wondering
if either of you had an idea.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.403
What do you mean, like, enemies?

13:15.446 --> 13:17.057
DANNY: Maybe one
of the fraternity brothers

13:17.100 --> 13:19.059
was particularly
tough on him?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.538
They're tough
on all the pledges.

13:20.582 --> 13:21.496
That's the tradition.

13:21.539 --> 13:25.152
But no one in particular, no.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.414
I never should've...

13:26.457 --> 13:28.677
You never should've what,
Mr. Jones?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.853
BAEZ:
We know this is difficult,

13:30.897 --> 13:33.987
but even something
that seems unconnected...

13:34.030 --> 13:35.553
My husband thought

13:35.597 --> 13:38.426
that the fraternity would be
terrific for Pete.

13:38.469 --> 13:41.081
Pete himself, not so much.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.169
MR. JONES:
He had a hard time

13:42.212 --> 13:44.345
making friends.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.564
Spent a lot of time on his own.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.306
It pained me to see him
alone so much, and I...

13:49.350 --> 13:54.007
My years at a frat were
some of the best of my life.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.531
I guess you could say
I pushed him into it.

13:56.574 --> 13:57.924
It's not your fault.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.360
But he didn't want to do it.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.057
DANNY: You did what you thought
was best for your son.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.059
Nobody joins
a fraternity thinking

14:03.103 --> 14:05.105
they're signing
their own death certificate.

14:05.148 --> 14:08.151
We're gonna do everything we can
to get to the bottom of this.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.326
Thank you.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.415
Officer Collins
will show you out.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.112
Right this way.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.157
We'll be in touch.

14:17.291 --> 14:21.034
Maybe Pete kind of did
bring this on himself.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.818
How?

14:22.862 --> 14:26.126
I'm just saying, he didn't
want to join a fraternity;

14:26.169 --> 14:27.867
then again, he didn't want
to let down his old man.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.346
Maybe he tried to 86 himself.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.044
By what, picking a fight?

14:31.087 --> 14:32.349
We got to start somewhere.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.047
What about this Bobby kid?

14:34.090 --> 14:35.613
Silent Bob?Yeah.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.138
Well, silent is how Pete's
parents just described him.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.792
You think Pete and Bobby
confided in each other?

14:40.836 --> 14:41.968
Birds of a feather.

14:43.099 --> 14:44.622
Let's take a ride.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.153
Hey, can you take a look
at this for me ASAP?

14:53.196 --> 14:54.981
I have to decide
if I'm gonna prosecute on that

14:55.024 --> 14:56.243
by the end of the day.All right, sure.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.940
I'm on it.What is all this?

14:57.984 --> 15:00.943
It's nothing.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.119
Doesn't look like nothing.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.730
Blue Skies Retirement Center?
You have something to tell me?

15:05.774 --> 15:08.211
I'm just looking
into them for a pal.A pal?

15:08.255 --> 15:11.040
Come on, Anthony, you already
have so much on your plate.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.564
Erin, you got to let me
open a case on this home.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.915
WhatBecause they gave

15:15.958 --> 15:18.308
my buddy's 80-year-old mother
an endoscopy.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.657
So?

15:19.701 --> 15:21.181
So she didn't ask for it.

15:21.224 --> 15:24.662
They didn't notify my buddy
or her primary doctor.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.055
A-And I called my friend

15:26.099 --> 15:28.536
who works with
the Medicaid inspector general,

15:28.579 --> 15:31.582
and Blue Skies Retirement
Center's on his radar, too.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.976
Okay, so why haven't they
shut them down?

15:34.020 --> 15:35.325
'Cause no one's died yet.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.980
Okay, I'm not following you.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.201
My buddy's me.

15:41.244 --> 15:44.944
And it's my ma they're
running unnecessary tests on.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.163
And you know the thing
about seniors?

15:47.207 --> 15:50.340
It takes one to die
before anyone does anything.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.342
That's not true.Not for you.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.214
You all can provide
for your family.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.738
I can't do that for my ma
on my own.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.261
Well, I see you're upset,

15:58.305 --> 16:01.177
but you can't just start a
crusade because of an endoscopy.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.267
She's my mother.

16:07.444 --> 16:10.404
What do you want me to do?

16:10.447 --> 16:12.667
I'll review your files
instead of going to lunch.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.930
No, I mean about your mother.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.197
Just look the other way.
For now.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.199
Like, we never had
this conversation?

16:23.243 --> 16:25.288
Like that, yeah.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.346
What the hell happened?Well, the kid calmed down.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.043
Even the bodega owner
said we should let him walk.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.916
He didn't want to press charges.We made a judgment call.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.918
Was there a crowd forming

16:46.962 --> 16:49.182
when you first
approached the kid?Of course. Free show.

16:49.225 --> 16:52.185
Did that have any effect on
your decision to let him walk?

16:52.228 --> 16:54.404
Wait, what are you asking?

16:54.448 --> 16:55.884
Did the crowd have
their phones out filming you?

16:55.927 --> 16:59.192
Yes. Just like every call
on every day.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.758
So?

17:00.802 --> 17:03.805
Are you familiar with what
they call the Ferguson effect?

17:03.848 --> 17:04.893
You think we didn't intervene

17:04.936 --> 17:06.155
because of fear
of repercussions?

17:06.199 --> 17:08.114
I don't know. I'm asking you.No.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.767
We played it by the book.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.205
And yes, we were well
aware we were being filmed

17:12.248 --> 17:13.641
and are aware
that those recordings

17:13.684 --> 17:16.774
can't always tell
the whole story.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.341
What? Come on, Maya.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.388
It was what it was. Two
cops, a neighborhood beef

17:21.431 --> 17:23.520
in a solidly Dominican
neighborhood.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.305
So which is it?

17:27.263 --> 17:29.657
It was a by-the-book stop...

17:29.700 --> 17:31.659
ended up sideways.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.096
I spoke to the store owner,
and he claims

17:34.140 --> 17:36.794
that he begged you two to arrest
the kid, but you refused.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.796
Well, he's lying.That's ridiculous.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.450
I'm just telling you
what he's claiming.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.409
And you believe him and not us?

17:42.452 --> 17:46.065
What I'm saying
is that there's a dispute

17:46.108 --> 17:47.849
as to what happened
on that first call.

17:47.892 --> 17:50.721
What's not in dispute is that
there's a woman in the hospital

17:50.765 --> 17:52.810
on account of that first call.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.728
You both lost your seats
in the car.

17:57.772 --> 18:01.080
You're on a foot patrol until
further notice. That's all.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.096
There he is.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.100
You got a second, Bobby?

18:21.143 --> 18:22.666
I-I told you everything I know.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.799
Everything you know fits
into three sentences?

18:24.842 --> 18:27.323
No.'Cause that's about all
we've heard from you.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.891
I need to get to class.No.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.502
Our needs come first.
And right now,

18:32.546 --> 18:34.156
we need to know what the hell
happened to Peter Jones.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.766
We're looking at his
death as a homicide.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.334
I thought
it was alcohol poisoning.Yeah, so did we.

18:38.378 --> 18:41.120
Until the M.E. showed us
how his skull was caved in.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.209
You know anything
about that?

18:43.252 --> 18:45.515
Hmm?

18:45.559 --> 18:48.518
You know, you seem like
a pretty nice kid, Bobby.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.347
And smart, too, obviously--
you go here.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.522
Life's been pretty good to you,
hasn't it?

18:52.566 --> 18:53.828
How am I doing so far?

18:53.871 --> 18:56.047
Okay.Yeah, well,

18:56.091 --> 18:57.745
here's where your life's
gonna get complicated.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.530
Couple NYPD detectives think
you may know something

19:00.574 --> 19:02.532
about a homicide
they're investigating.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.621
Think you might be holding out.
You know what that means?

19:04.665 --> 19:05.970
I'm not, I swear.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.407
Come on, my partner and I

19:07.450 --> 19:09.017
got X-ray vision; we can see
right through you, kid.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.019
You're holding out. What?

19:11.062 --> 19:12.629
Spit it out.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.415
I was surprised that Pete joined
the frat in the first place.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.156
Surprised how?

19:17.199 --> 19:18.592
He reminded me of my brother...

19:18.635 --> 19:20.855
before my brother
came out of the closet.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.726
How's that?He was acting out.

19:22.770 --> 19:26.077
Like he was trying to distract
people from who he really was.

19:26.121 --> 19:28.123
And he was drinking a ton, too.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.646
Was Pete drinking
last night?

19:29.690 --> 19:31.605
Last time I remember
seeing Peter,

19:31.648 --> 19:34.347
he was going downstairs
to the basement with Colin.

19:34.390 --> 19:35.391
To do what?

19:35.435 --> 19:37.611
Get a fresh keg.Then what happened?

19:37.654 --> 19:41.223
A little later on, I saw Mike
and Colin come up with the keg.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.225
Peter wasn't with them.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.271
Why didn't you
tell us this earlier?

19:45.314 --> 19:47.447
I was drunk,
so it's all kind of blurry.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.796
And when I asked Colin about it,

19:48.839 --> 19:50.537
he told me
that I must have been mistaken.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.495
What makes you so sure
of this now?

19:53.931 --> 19:55.542
There's a video.

19:55.585 --> 19:56.847
What video?

19:56.891 --> 19:59.285
Of the party.
It's a thing with Zeta Phi Tau.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.025
Uh, we take a quick video

20:01.069 --> 20:02.766
of all the parties
right at midnight and share it

20:02.810 --> 20:05.247
with the other chapters. It's
called the Midnight Special.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.249
And you're in charge
of shooting this video?

20:07.293 --> 20:09.947
You still have it?

20:09.991 --> 20:12.298
I noticed when I rewatched it.

20:12.341 --> 20:15.605
It caught Colin and Peter going
downstairs in the background.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.785
I told you.What'd you tell me?

20:21.829 --> 20:23.396
That Sergeant Reagan.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.267
Couple months
with stripes on his sleeve,

20:25.311 --> 20:28.270
he acts like he's sitting up
in One PP with five stars.Oh, that's not fair.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.316
What's not fair
is a foot post.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.448
That was pretty harsh."Pretty"?

20:32.492 --> 20:34.407
Why are you
sticking up for him?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.800
He's screwing you over, too.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.020
He's just doing his job. Please.

20:39.063 --> 20:42.066
His job is to second-guess
his cops on the street?

20:42.110 --> 20:44.547
It went sideways, Maya.Not my fault.

20:44.591 --> 20:47.115
No, but we did let that
kid walk pretty fast.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.770
And you did point out how many
cameras were filming us, so...Whoa.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.989
Whoa.Hey, I wasn't saying...

20:52.033 --> 20:54.601
I know this precinct and
what works and what doesn't,

20:54.644 --> 20:56.646
which is more than
you or Reagan do.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.301
Hey, Maya...See you when I see you.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.752
Irish neat, glass of ice,

21:15.796 --> 21:17.711
back Sully up.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.671
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns...

21:21.715 --> 21:24.195
Stopped by your house.
They said you'd be here.

21:24.239 --> 21:27.286
When my wife's sisters come
to stay, I generally am.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.591
I met 'em both.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.201
:
You made the right move.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.508
Jewish holiday,
eight letters,

21:32.552 --> 21:34.293
begins with "P."

21:34.336 --> 21:36.773
Passover.
Exactly.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.688
You didn't get
passed over, Sully.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.777
Firearms and Tactics
are where you belong,

21:40.821 --> 21:43.911
and that's where you're
the most valuable.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.829
Thank you.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.135
She stepped
right over me.

21:51.179 --> 21:54.530
She is the best choice
for chief of training.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.359
Wasn't even close.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.056
It was my turn.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.145
No such thing as turns.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.453
Second time I've
been passed over.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.760
First, Hostage Negotiation.

22:06.803 --> 22:09.023
Oh, give me a break, Sully.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.593
Hostage Negotiation was never
on the table for you.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.899
I mean, you talking
a jumper down?

22:15.943 --> 22:18.815
"Get the hell off that ledge,
or I'll push you off myself."

22:19.816 --> 22:22.297
Time was, toughness
was an asset.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.560
Still is. Comes in all
shapes and sizes.

22:24.604 --> 22:25.909
Oh, give me a break.

22:25.953 --> 22:28.738
Oh, come on, Sully.

22:28.782 --> 22:31.175
We've known each other too long.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.221
Let's not do this.

22:34.396 --> 22:37.399
I'd make a great
chief of training, Frank.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.749
And you know that.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.796
But it's 2018,
and the new wisdom is

22:42.839 --> 22:44.667
a younger Asian female's
a better candidate

22:44.711 --> 22:47.583
than an older white guy.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.803
Call it what it is.

22:52.936 --> 22:57.811
When you were my son Danny's
first C.O., he came to me.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.378
Did you know that?

22:59.421 --> 23:02.816
Yeah, he said, "Dad,
this guy Sully's a good cop,

23:02.859 --> 23:06.080
but maybe he's too tough on us."

23:06.123 --> 23:09.170
You're learning the ropes,
sometimes you get rope burns.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.824
He did two tours in Iraq.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.043
He knew the ropes.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.436
And your point is?

23:14.480 --> 23:17.787
If Danny Reagan says you
are too tough a cop,

23:17.831 --> 23:19.485
it's like Keith Richards saying

23:19.528 --> 23:23.140
you have a substance
abuse problem.

23:23.184 --> 23:25.360
You really should listen.

23:30.321 --> 23:33.716
I hate to see you
bending to these winds.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.893
And I'd hate to lose you
from this department.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.815
Lot of good years left.

24:00.090 --> 24:03.703
Another guy chugging.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.444
What she calls dancing.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.967
What are we looking for?

24:07.010 --> 24:09.099
Them. That's who
we're looking for.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.187
Can you zoom in?

24:12.625 --> 24:13.539
DANNY:
There's Pete,

24:13.582 --> 24:15.105
as promised.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.324
Anything else?

24:16.367 --> 24:18.065
Did you find anything
in their social media?

24:19.327 --> 24:21.068
I did notice one thing.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.723
This kid, Mike,
has Colin in all of his posts.

24:23.766 --> 24:27.553
But if you look at Colin's page,
you'd never know Mike existed.

24:30.556 --> 24:33.733
Officer, I've already told you
everything I know.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.213
That's the problem, Jose.
I don't think you did.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.606
What do you mean?

24:37.650 --> 24:39.521
I think you were afraid
what might happen to you,

24:39.565 --> 24:41.349
and so you lied to me and said

24:41.392 --> 24:43.177
that you asked those officers
to arrest that kid.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.657
Why would I do that?

24:44.700 --> 24:46.789
Because you're employing Luis
without paying him.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.574
What are you saying, Officer?

24:48.617 --> 24:49.705
That he's here illegally,

24:49.749 --> 24:51.185
that you and your wife
knew that,

24:51.228 --> 24:52.795
and that you were
making him work for you

24:52.839 --> 24:53.970
under threat of
informing ICE.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.581
You got it all wrong.Forcing someone

24:55.624 --> 24:57.147
to work for nothing,
that's called slavery here.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.410
It's been illegal
for about 150 years.

25:00.934 --> 25:03.502
We made him sandwiches.
That's a kind of pay.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.634
I'd like you to come down
to the station

25:05.678 --> 25:07.375
and clear this up for me.

25:08.637 --> 25:10.552
Can you give me, uh,
ten minutes to close up?

25:10.596 --> 25:11.684
I'll give you two minutes.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.077
Thank you, Officer.It's Sergeant.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.210
Sergeant.

25:25.436 --> 25:28.396
♪

25:28.439 --> 25:30.050
Sure, sure.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.574
Yeah, I-I remember you.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.575
Henry.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.534
Well, it's been a long time.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.796
It sure has.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.580
How are you?

25:38.624 --> 25:40.756
About as well as
can be expected.
Good.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.628
How are they treating you here?

25:42.671 --> 25:44.586
Well, you know,
it's pretty good.

25:44.630 --> 25:48.155
But, uh, they give us
so many tests.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.765
Really?

25:49.809 --> 25:52.246
You know, like they say,

25:52.289 --> 25:54.378
old age is not for wimps.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.385
Oh, my gosh.

26:01.429 --> 26:02.386
What?

26:02.430 --> 26:04.606
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.695
Who?
Reading the paper,

26:06.739 --> 26:08.088
right over there.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.220
LUCILLE:
Jack Kehoe.

26:10.264 --> 26:12.483
Excuse me a minute?
Sure.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.531
Jack.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.880
Jack Kehoe?

26:17.924 --> 26:19.708
Yes?

26:19.752 --> 26:21.492
Henry Reagan.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.583
Henry.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.714
How the hell are you?

26:25.758 --> 26:27.020
Well, a lot better than you,

26:27.063 --> 26:29.022
from the looks of your
dance partner there.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.115
So, uh, how you doing?

26:38.814 --> 26:40.163
Maybe this was
a bad idea.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.078
That thought applies to
about five different things

26:42.122 --> 26:43.558
in my mind right now.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.646
Whoa.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.649
So, would you mind
being more specific?

26:47.693 --> 26:49.651
You coming over
to the 2-9.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.828
Oh. That wasn't even
one of the five.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.657
Eddie, I'm the boss now.
That's gonna come up.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.355
Not always in a good way.
Almost never in a good way.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.879
You took me out
of the car,

26:59.922 --> 27:01.794
and you put me
on a foot post.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.274
Eddie. Eddie.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.712
I busted both of you.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.844
Okay, what was I gonna do,
her and not you?

27:08.888 --> 27:10.280
Or neither?

27:10.324 --> 27:12.152
Let me guess.
She's one of those,

27:12.195 --> 27:13.675
the cell phone
cameras come on,

27:13.719 --> 27:15.764
and she starts playing defense
instead of offense.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.157
Am I right?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.028
I'll take that as a yes.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.378
You know what?
You're a sergeant, not a mystic.

27:21.422 --> 27:22.684
Don't get ahead of yourself.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.599
Eddie, the foot post
was a little harsh,

27:24.643 --> 27:26.688
but it had to be.Why?

27:26.732 --> 27:29.212
So that you and Maya would pull
a common enemy out of this.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.737
You guys would have a chance
to bond as partners on the job.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.086
I defended you.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.828
I think that was a mistake, too.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.743
"Too"
I'm the boss.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.353
Nobody likes the boss.

27:39.396 --> 27:42.051
Eddie, half the fun of the job
is making fun of the boss.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.184
Oh, I look forward
to catching up on that.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.535
Seriously, if we're gonna
turn this precinct around

27:47.578 --> 27:49.189
and you're my agent
on the ground,

27:49.232 --> 27:51.017
there's gonna be cross fire.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.845
Is that what we're doing?

27:52.888 --> 27:54.281
Turning the whole precinct
around?

27:54.324 --> 27:56.805
Yeah, one cop at a time.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.690
It work?

28:11.733 --> 28:13.648
Yeah, like a charm.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.780
What'd you get?

28:14.823 --> 28:17.347
A lot of selfies
with my new old friends.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.827
I meant...

28:18.871 --> 28:22.091
It's like they're running
a placebo clinic in there.

28:22.135 --> 28:26.139
Guys walking around with I.V.
bags full of saline solution

28:26.182 --> 28:28.750
they're told
is lifesaving meds.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.534
And getting
billed as that.

28:30.578 --> 28:31.840
I'm guessing.

28:31.884 --> 28:34.669
And the attending
physician, Brian.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.845
You know he's a Brian Junior?

28:36.889 --> 28:38.064
So?

28:38.107 --> 28:40.066
His father was a doctor.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.242
Passed away nine months ago.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.635
One of the old-timers
told me that he thought

28:44.679 --> 28:47.682
Brian Junior's degree
was in nursing.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.467
So, the doc's not even a doc?

28:50.511 --> 28:51.642
Looks like that.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.602
Bastards.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.299
Don't drive angry.

28:56.343 --> 28:58.737
I'd like to make it home.

29:01.348 --> 29:03.742
I forgot how lucky I am.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.226
All right, here we go.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.230
You and Sean do this
all yourselves?

29:14.274 --> 29:15.275
That's right.
Wow.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.319
We made all Jack's favorites

29:16.363 --> 29:18.321
in celebration of
his birthday.

29:18.365 --> 29:19.583
Which is today,
as we know.

29:19.627 --> 29:20.628
We know.That's right.

29:20.671 --> 29:21.934
Everybody send cards?ALL: Yes.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.109
NICKY: We should all
FaceTime him after we eat.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.240
DANNY:
Definitely.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.589
Good idea.ERIN: First birthday away.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.026
It's happy and sad.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.375
Yeah.

29:28.418 --> 29:29.985
Nah, his age, you get to be
too old for birthdays.

29:30.029 --> 29:31.508
It becomes about your parents
being too gooey.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.859
You cashed the checks,
as I remember.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.862
And Mom made me wear the
pointed hat well into my 20s.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.341
Well, small price to pay.

29:38.385 --> 29:39.821
Pictures, please.ERIN: Oh, yeah.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.301
Photo album's in
the living room.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.172
Is this varmint or critter?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.914
Chicken fried steak
and chicken fried chicken.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.220
FRANK: Oh.Yeah, but you got to put

29:47.263 --> 29:48.743
the sausage gravy on it
for the full effect.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.267
What effect is that,
a full cardiac arrest?

29:51.311 --> 29:52.965
Ha ha.Very funny.

29:53.008 --> 29:53.792
Are there any vegetables?

29:53.835 --> 29:55.489
Onion rings.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.317
There you go.
French fries.
You got your potato.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.624
And there's pickles. And ketchup
is kind of a vegetable, right?

30:00.668 --> 30:01.756
SEAN: Yeah.
FRANK: Perfect.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.844
Kind of.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.542
I don't want to hear
complaining.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.503
I'm not complaining, Pop.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.288
I'm hearing snark.
I don't like snark.

30:12.332 --> 30:13.507
Pops, we were just joking.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.944
What we should all be
is grateful.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.034
What's up, Pop?

30:21.602 --> 30:23.996
I visited a nursing home
the other day.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.998
It's just so depressing.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.521
Who'd you visit?

30:28.827 --> 30:29.958
Ronnie.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.742
Ronnie. Oh, where's Ronnie?

30:31.786 --> 30:33.962
The, uh, Sunset something.

30:34.006 --> 30:36.008
Blue Skies?

30:36.051 --> 30:37.836
No, the Sunset
or Sunrise something.

30:39.141 --> 30:43.624
And I was starkly aware
of how good I have it.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.670
How good we all have it,
having each other.

30:48.281 --> 30:51.153
I'm... I'm just feeling...

30:51.197 --> 30:54.287
especially blessed.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.506
That's all I'm gonna say.
Pass the meat, please.

30:56.550 --> 30:59.031
Critter or varmint?Both, thanks.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.293
Grace first.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.295
Bless us, O Lord.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.906
ALL: For these, thy gifts,
which we are about to receive

31:04.950 --> 31:08.475
from thy bounty,
through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

31:08.518 --> 31:09.868
FRANK: Okay.
Varmint or critter?

31:20.487 --> 31:23.055
Okay.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.100
I talked to Sully.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.537
I think I made a dent,

31:27.581 --> 31:30.410
but if I had a nickel every time
I liked what I thought...

31:30.453 --> 31:32.499
Would you like
to postpone?

31:32.542 --> 31:33.848
Would you?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.937
No.

31:35.981 --> 31:39.549
Look, here's all
you need to know.

31:39.593 --> 31:41.769
Even if Sully decides
to bring the suit,

31:41.812 --> 31:44.685
that's nothing compared
to what you're in for--

31:44.728 --> 31:46.817
the actual job.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.732
From?
From all sides.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.996
And this high up,

31:51.039 --> 31:54.825
you can't just give 'em rips
or brace 'em in the locker room.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.828
Locker room's off-
limits to me anyway.

32:01.876 --> 32:04.923
I hope you know what I'm saying.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.534
I think so.

32:07.577 --> 32:11.103
I need to know for sure.

32:11.146 --> 32:14.976
Gook, Chink, Nip,

32:15.020 --> 32:17.848
a Charlie, slant,

32:17.892 --> 32:20.112
slope, Tokyo Rose.

32:23.245 --> 32:26.074
Heard 'em all before I was ten.

32:26.118 --> 32:29.164
You didn't hear those words
in my department.

32:29.208 --> 32:32.341
Nope, but even if I did,

32:32.385 --> 32:34.517
it wouldn't affect
how I do my job.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.130
Because you've had
a very thick skin

32:38.173 --> 32:41.220
since even before
the fourth grade.

32:41.263 --> 32:43.265
Pretty much.

32:44.614 --> 32:47.835
Let's say a Sully--

32:47.878 --> 32:52.187
let's say he gave you
an "attaboy" on the promotion.

32:52.231 --> 32:56.496
Would that also bounce
right off that thick skin?

32:56.539 --> 32:57.845
What do you mean?

32:57.888 --> 32:59.847
Or...

32:59.890 --> 33:02.850
would it feel good,

33:02.893 --> 33:06.114
coming from some
old

33:15.819 --> 33:17.430
It would feel good.

33:24.132 --> 33:27.222
Because it came
from a fellow cop.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.713
Officer Janko, Officer Thomas,
thanks for stopping by.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.542
I wasn't aware
we had a choice.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.457
Know it's been a tough week.
I'd like to apologize

33:44.500 --> 33:45.762
if you perceived
that I didn't have your back.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.938
'Cause you didn't?

33:47.982 --> 33:51.681
They were working Luis
without any pay.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.074
He's here illegally.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.076
Both of them backed down

33:55.120 --> 33:56.686
because nobody
in that neighborhood wants

33:56.730 --> 33:58.340
to bring their beefs
into the precinct.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.342
Could have
told you that.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.953
So why'd he lie, the owner?
Saying he asked us

34:02.997 --> 34:04.390
to arrest Luis?

34:04.433 --> 34:05.826
Panicked it'd look like
he didn't protect his wife.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.306
He tried

34:07.349 --> 34:09.656
to walk back what happened
by stepping all over you guys.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.787
Oh.

34:12.006 --> 34:14.922
So... we're good?

34:14.965 --> 34:16.924
Almost.

34:16.967 --> 34:20.362
Your instincts, your actions you
take out there can't be driven

34:20.406 --> 34:23.409
by whether or not you're being
recorded, not on my watch.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.760
They weren't.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.022
Didn't enter into it.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.764
Can't help but enter into it--

34:30.807 --> 34:35.638
a crowd, these streets,
this climate.

34:35.682 --> 34:37.336
I hear you.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.859
Copy that.

34:38.902 --> 34:41.514
There's a whole review system
in place

34:41.557 --> 34:44.125
for cases exactly like this,
so, trust it.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.648
All right?

34:45.692 --> 34:47.737
You guys are back on wheels,
so get out of here.

34:47.781 --> 34:48.782
Sarge, if I may?

34:48.825 --> 34:50.784
Um... thank you.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.613
My old sergeant--
he wouldn't have taken the time.

34:53.656 --> 34:56.398
Just doing my job.

35:03.013 --> 35:05.015
You ever go down
to the basement with Peter?

35:05.059 --> 35:06.191
I already told you, no.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.801
That's interesting,
'cause we have video

35:07.844 --> 35:11.021
of you going downstairs
to the basement withPete

35:11.065 --> 35:12.197
and coming upstairs without him.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.720
Oh, so you're
trusting Bobby now?

35:13.763 --> 35:14.895
He's a pathological liar.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.026
The tape don't lie, kid,

35:16.070 --> 35:17.332
and get your hands
back on the table.

35:17.376 --> 35:18.551
Don't call me "kid."

35:18.594 --> 35:20.944
You realize that if you two
were hazing him,

35:20.988 --> 35:22.990
you're both gonna be facing
second-degree murder charges,

35:23.033 --> 35:25.166
right?Well, we weren't.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.125
BAEZ:
It tough being away

35:27.168 --> 35:28.778
from your family?

35:28.822 --> 35:30.345
Yeah, of course,
but the frat helps,

35:30.389 --> 35:32.565
and they're like my family.

35:32.608 --> 35:33.914
You sure have a funny way
of showing it.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.525
For the millionth time,
we did nothing wrong.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.874
We don't haze.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.180
Why are you covering for Colin?

35:39.224 --> 35:41.443
What do you mean?

35:41.487 --> 35:42.836
Is he your best friend?

35:42.879 --> 35:44.142
Detective... this
going somewhere?Yes!

35:44.185 --> 35:45.795
He doesn't post
any photos with you.

35:45.839 --> 35:46.840
Does that bother you?

35:46.883 --> 35:48.885
What are you trying to say?

35:48.929 --> 35:51.453
You think he'd face years
in jail for you?

35:52.889 --> 35:55.022
I don't know.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.893
Because that's what's
happening here.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.330
The more you continue to lie,

35:58.373 --> 36:00.114
the more trouble
you're gonna be in.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.290
Ah. Well, this just
got a little bit easier.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.552
What happened?

36:03.596 --> 36:04.901
Colin told the truth.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.077
He did?
Yeah, he did.

36:07.121 --> 36:10.255
You two were hazing Peter,
you lost control.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.126
He tried to stop you,
but he couldn't,

36:12.170 --> 36:15.129
and then you blackmailed
him to cover for you.

36:17.958 --> 36:20.308
He didn't say that.
He did.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.875
He wouldn't.
He would.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.746
Got a statement right here.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.792
Then hand it over.

36:25.835 --> 36:28.186
Just a second.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

36:33.365 --> 36:35.323
My guy's lawyer's
not as sharp.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.369
Let's try this
again over here.

36:38.805 --> 36:41.938
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but your buddy Mike flipped

36:41.982 --> 36:42.983
and turned you in.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.376
Colin, don't say a word.

36:44.419 --> 36:45.942
You're looking at

36:45.986 --> 36:47.205
some serious time, kid.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.685
He would never.Well, he did.

36:49.729 --> 36:52.471
In fact, he just finished giving
my partner his statement.

36:52.514 --> 36:55.082
I did nothing wrong.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.911
I... I was just trying
to be nice to that loser.

36:57.954 --> 37:00.870
I'm sure you were.No, I just took him down to the
basement to give him some coke.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.655
Coke. Oh, well,
I guess we'll be adding

37:02.698 --> 37:04.178
"criminal possession"
to your list of charges.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.137
No, I am the victim here,
don't you see?No, I don't see.

37:07.181 --> 37:09.836
I was just trying to be nice to
that fairy, and what does he do?

37:11.141 --> 37:13.013
Oh.

37:13.056 --> 37:16.234
Pete made a move on you,
and you didn't like it?

37:16.277 --> 37:19.062
Colin, enough.He tried to kiss me, okay?

37:19.106 --> 37:21.630
Like I was some chick.
He was grabbing at me.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.066
And then what happened?

37:23.110 --> 37:25.068
I lost it! Who wouldn't?Careful, Detective.

37:25.112 --> 37:26.940
My client is claiming he was
the victim of a sexual assault.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.463
He tried to kiss you,
you lost it,

37:28.507 --> 37:31.031
and what happened next?!I shoved him!

37:31.074 --> 37:33.076
I shoved him away.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.864
You shoved him away,

37:37.907 --> 37:38.995
and he fell down,

37:39.039 --> 37:42.129
and he never got back up again,
did he?

37:42.172 --> 37:44.044
It wasn't my fault.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.612
He's the victim of
a sexual assault.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.223
He had the right...He can tell that
to the judge.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.966
Get on your feet... kid.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.011
Get up!

38:07.067 --> 38:09.025
HENRY:
I think Erin

38:09.069 --> 38:11.071
suspects I had something
to do with this.

38:11.114 --> 38:13.334
All I said was I
used an undercover.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.814
Yeah, I know, but...

38:14.857 --> 38:16.816
I kind of...

38:16.859 --> 38:18.992
At dinner on Sunday,
I inadvertently...

38:19.035 --> 38:20.210
Inadvertently?

38:20.254 --> 38:22.212
I didn't mean to.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.214
But she's like a ferret.

38:24.258 --> 38:27.653
Well, you know
what she's like.Come clean?

38:27.696 --> 38:29.176
No.

38:29.219 --> 38:32.179
It's bound to come up
eventually, this goes to trial.

38:32.222 --> 38:35.356
I thought maybe
we could tell her together.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.576
Strength in numbers?

38:37.619 --> 38:39.578
You got it.

38:41.623 --> 38:44.409
So, did you find a place
for your ma?

38:44.452 --> 38:46.846
Yeah.
Where?

38:46.889 --> 38:49.718
With me. See how it goes.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.418
Good for you, Anthony.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.510
GORMLEY: When your
name is called,

38:58.553 --> 39:00.599
you walk up the aisle
on the right.

39:00.642 --> 39:01.687
Stage right or my right?

39:01.730 --> 39:03.123
Uh, your right.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.212
You walk up to the first
deputy commissioner,

39:05.255 --> 39:06.605
and you shake his hand.

39:06.648 --> 39:08.737
Then when the master
of ceremonies states,

39:08.781 --> 39:12.480
"I now introduce the
new chief of training,"

39:12.524 --> 39:14.526
you face the commissioner

39:14.569 --> 39:16.615
and salute.

39:18.225 --> 39:20.488
Inspector Sullivan
is asking for a moment.

39:29.628 --> 39:30.890
Let's have him.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.984
Commissioner.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.812
Inspector.

39:39.855 --> 39:40.900
Sid.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.597
Sully.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.558
Kimura, it was nothing personal.

39:48.864 --> 39:51.171
Congratulations.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.789
Thank you, Sully.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.812
It's just not right.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.083
I'll see you in court.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.058
And then?

40:52.101 --> 40:53.581
FRANK:
Then,

40:53.625 --> 40:55.104
you walk up to the mayor,

40:55.148 --> 40:57.193
and she presents you
with your new shield.

40:57.237 --> 40:59.413
You turn and shake my hand,

40:59.457 --> 41:02.460
and exit via the stage
to the left.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.594
Got it. Ready when you are.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.727
Shall we?

41:08.770 --> 41:10.772
I'm right behind you.
