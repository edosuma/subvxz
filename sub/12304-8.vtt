WEBVTT

00:48.960 --> 00:50.400
Another runner.
Did you get a plate?

00:50.440 --> 00:51.840
Are you kidding me?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.320
Total disrespect.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.920
Don't these idiots get it?

00:54.960 --> 00:56.800
If you're going to roll,
you pay the toll.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.600
Well, if we don't catch them,
the camera will.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.040
WOMAN IN CAR:
Stop, you're hurting me.

00:42.080 --> 00:42.560
(engine roars)

01:17.560 --> 01:19.040
What about your change?

01:27.880 --> 01:29.080
Oh, my God.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.200
What is it?

01:35.800 --> 01:37.240
I'm calling the police.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.800
(indistinct police
radio transmission)

01:56.120 --> 01:58.240
Tollbooth witness
couldn't see the driver.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
Said the car was charcoal gray.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.920
What about the passenger?

02:01.920 --> 02:03.280
Nothing,
except she was female.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.320
Female,
no hard ID.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.720
Our mystery girl
did leave us this.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.520
Looks like blood.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.640
CAINE:
"He's going to kill me!"

02:13.920 --> 02:15.040
Think it's a prank?

02:15.040 --> 02:17.240
No such luck, Frank.

02:20.800 --> 02:24.320
* Yeah! *

02:43.640 --> 02:46.920
* We don't get fooled again *

02:47.520 --> 02:51.080
* Don't get fooled again *

02:51.120 --> 02:52.320
* No, no! *

04:06.120 --> 04:08.680
What did Hemotrace say?

04:08.760 --> 04:09.800
Blood's human.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.560
Dispatch says you wanted
the AV equipment.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.680
Let's check the cameras
in these booths.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.040
They may have something.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.800
If I find something,
where you going to be?

04:16.800 --> 04:20.040
We just found a body,
right down this road.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.680
Powdery substance on her leg.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.520
Could be soil.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.560
Doesn't look like
it's from around here.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.800
Who found the body?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.600
Jet skier.
Taking a break.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.400
Horatio, she was
definitely restrained.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.560
Marks are parallel.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.320
Looks like something rigid.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.200
Maybe from handcuffs.
What about those nails, Alexx?

05:10.280 --> 05:12.400
Broken, worn down.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.840
Could be acrylic.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.520
Wherever she was,
she tried to claw her way out.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.440
(screams)

05:23.480 --> 05:25.200
CAINE:
I.D.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.920
Miss Leslie Anderson.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.200
Pretty girl.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.400
Think she's the one
from the tollbooth?

05:33.680 --> 05:34.880
Could be.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.720
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

05:47.280 --> 05:48.480
WOLFE:
Hi.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.960
This the surveillance video?

05:50.320 --> 05:52.120
Yeah, it was downloaded
from the tollbooth.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.120
Okay, here's
where the car comes in.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.680
WOLFE:
The passenger compartment's
no good at this angle.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.040
You get a plate?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.320
It doesn't make any sense.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.920
The numbers are distorted,
but the car is in focus.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.800
They got a PhotoShield;
people use them to beat

06:05.840 --> 06:07.480
overhead cameras
at traffic lights.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.440
But I can't make out anything.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.240
Well, it's transparent;
it uses a thin diffusion lens.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.800
<i> Light at an oblique angle</i>

06:15.800 --> 06:19.640
<i> causes the cover
to reflect and refract.</i>

06:22.000 --> 06:23.160
It makes it
impossibleo read

06:23.200 --> 06:24.720
unless you're
directly behind it.

06:25.240 --> 06:28.600
DUQUESNE:
So somebody really wanted
this car to be anonymous.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.400
This missing girl's
in a lot of trouble, huh?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.120
Yeah.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.360
You got
another angle?

06:34.600 --> 06:35.800
It's hard to see
the driver

06:35.800 --> 06:37.760
because there's sunlight
reflected off the windshield.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.000
There's something
under the wiper blade.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.120
WOLFE:
It's a valet stub.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.720
Those numbers or that logo could
help us find the neighborhood.

06:46.240 --> 06:46.600
You know what?

06:46.600 --> 06:49.720
Let's see if we can take
a better look at the passenger.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.720
All right, so this is where

06:50.720 --> 06:53.240
she hands the bloody bill
to the witness.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.120
Wait a minute.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.040
Check out her arm.
It's ligature marks.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.600
Oh, yeah, look
at the bruising.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.600
Horatio said
that the victim at the jetty

07:02.600 --> 07:05.040
had the same thing.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.400
(elevator bell dings)

07:11.320 --> 07:13.360
Horatio.

07:13.640 --> 07:17.520
I finished the post
from our vic on the rocks,
Leslie Anderson.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.760
She had a broken frenulum.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.080
So she was suffocated.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.080
I also did
a photo comparison

07:26.080 --> 07:27.880
with the girl from the car
and our vic.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.480
Ligature marks are ckssistent.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.800
The bottom line, Alexx:

07:31.800 --> 07:33.760
they were attacked
by the same predator.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.520
Leslie Anderson was dead
at least two days

07:36.640 --> 07:38.000
before she was discovered.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.200
And our missing girl
is still out there.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.240
Thank you, Alexx.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.040
Hey.
Hi.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.760
It's the trace
from Leslie Anderson's pants.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.280
Yep. Silicon dioxide
and aluminum oxide.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.080
It's clay dust.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.120
No, I get that,
but what's the gray stuff?

08:05.120 --> 08:06.080
It's mortar.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.960
Like from
a clay tile?
Mm-hmm.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.280
75 years ago, mortar was used
without additional fasteners.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.280
Now it's wired
or nailed secured.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.040
So this could be like
from an historical building?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.920
Yeah. Well, this
amount of trace,

08:18.920 --> 08:21.080
the vic had to be around
a lot of clay dust.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.240
Sorry to interrupt, you guys.
Uh, valet stub.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.720
I ID'd the company logo.
Yeah.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.680
You got an address?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.360
Yeah, it's a neighborhood
restaurant in the Gables.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.400
You know who eats there.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.520
People who live
in the neighborhood.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.720
(chuckles)

08:39.520 --> 08:41.799
This restaurant puts us
a block away from a building

08:41.799 --> 08:43.960
that's over 100 years old.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.600
According to the bank records,
this place is in foreclosure.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.720
So what, our suspe
is squatting here?

09:02.800 --> 09:04.920
No rent,
no questions asked.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.800
Looks abandoned to me.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.280
Clay tile.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.360
A trace from our victim.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.160
Frank.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.240
No.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.480
Stop it!

09:29.560 --> 09:31.000
(screaming)

09:31.560 --> 09:33.840
Our murder vic was
definitely here.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.320
(footsteps approach)

09:35.600 --> 09:38.000
Freeze! Don't move!
Hands, mister.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.680
I'll shoot you
where you stand.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.640
You e owner?

09:50.520 --> 09:52.600
Tommy Boyer.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.040
Hook him up.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.640
I'll call Horatio.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.400
I don't know Leslie Anderson.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.600
She was suffocated two days ago
d evidence leads us to you.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.800
My-my fiance, Jill Girrard,

10:24.800 --> 10:26.080
we're supposed
to be married in a week.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.760
She went off with some friends,
never came back.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.560
That still doesn't explain
why you were in the building.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.600
I got desperate.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.600
Jill and I are on the TeleAid
account for the Mercedes.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.040
They gave me the address.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.720
I figured she
got cold feet.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.880
Ran off with
some rich guy.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.560
Didn't have the guts to tell me.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.840
I went inside to take a look.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.960
<i> Her car was there.She wasn't.</i>

11:07.840 --> 11:09.720
That's when you
guys found me.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.760
I-I don't know Leslie Anderson.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.760
I certainly didn't
suffocate her.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.840
Do you have
a photograph of Jill?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.520
Yeah, I do.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.080
I'm also going to need
a personaltem,

11:21.080 --> 11:23.160
like a hairbrush.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.240
Please, help me find her,
Lieutenant.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.840
I'll do that.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.120
TRIPP:
That's one solid safe.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.360
You know, my uncle
was a safecracker.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.520
He taught me
when I was 11.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.040
That's pretty cool.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.560
Hope there's not a body inside.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
(clicks)

12:10.320 --> 12:12.520
They're not bodies.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.080
I think they're something worse.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.640
They're trophies.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.440
TRIPP:
Necklace, underwear, glasses?

12:21.840 --> 12:24.800
WOLFE:
This is a picture
of Leslie Anderson.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.400
Let's get this
stuff out of here.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.320
And, Frank, put on some gloves.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.920
These are our only link
to the killer.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.400
Did you process
the fiance's Meedes?

12:43.400 --> 12:44.960
Yeah, nothing.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.400
The onlyhing that we have
to go on for the passenger

12:47.400 --> 12:49.120
in the tollbooth is
the five-dollar bill.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.480
Yeah, well,
the blood on the bill

12:50.520 --> 12:51.840
didn't match
Leslie Anderson

12:52.080 --> 12:54.080
or the DNA from
Jill Girrard's hairbrush.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.520
So there's a chance our mystery
girl could be one of these.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.560
Yeah.

13:01.160 --> 13:04.040
I think these pictures were
taken by somebody they trusted.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.600
Yeah, you're right.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.560
They don't look afraid.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.840
It's like he got them to go
with him willingly somehow.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.080
Hey.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.200
These the photos
from the safe?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.200
Yeah, Ryan found them.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.720
We're processing
the blood from DNA.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.520
We're going to see
if one of these girls kicks out.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.840
Oh, my God.
What?

13:20.840 --> 13:22.640
That-That's Anya.
Who's Anya?

13:22.720 --> 13:23.800
(cell phone beeps)

13:23.840 --> 13:24.920
(spe dialing)

13:26.320 --> 13:26.800
BOA VISTA:
Voicemail.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.560
Anya, it's me,
um, I'm...

13:29.200 --> 13:31.440
I'm worried, so call me.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.320
Will you just keep
hitting "redial"?

13:35.320 --> 13:37.800
I'm gonna go
check something out.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.600
Who's Anya?

13:51.880 --> 13:53.440
Are those the samples
for the DNA bill?

13:53.480 --> 13:55.160
Yeah. They're almost
ready for the 310.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.160
I've got one more
sample for you.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.800
You worked in here, Natalia.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.000
You know
the evidence submissions

14:00.000 --> 14:01.480
are processed in order.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.240
So you can wait
for the next run.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.800
Valera, one of those pictures
is of my sister.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.880
That rates a jump.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.840
Please compare this
against these other samples.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.760
I'm sorry. I...

14:13.760 --> 14:15.560
Just do it now, okay?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.600
* *

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
(printer running)

15:01.360 --> 15:03.560
Miss Boa Vista?

15:03.960 --> 15:05.400
What's going on?

15:06.480 --> 15:09.800
The girl
in the tollbooth car

15:09.800 --> 15:12.560
is my sister.

15:12.560 --> 15:13.960
We have to find her,
Lieutenant.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.000
We will.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.000
SIKES:
Lieutenant Caine,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.360
who are the women
in these photographs?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.440
As you can see,
some of the women behind me

15:37.480 --> 15:38.880
have yet to be identified.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.880
Where did these photographs
come from?

15:40.320 --> 15:42.040
We recovered the photographs
from a locked safe

15:42.400 --> 15:44.160
during the execution
of a search warrant.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.360
Is that person a suspect?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.000
Is there anyone
in custody?

15:47.560 --> 15:48.480
Lieutenant,

15:48.520 --> 15:50.160
who are these girls?

15:50.160 --> 15:52.760
While I'm not at liberty
to discuss the details

15:52.760 --> 15:54.400
of an ongoing investigation,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.640
I can say that any help
that the public gives us

15:56.640 --> 15:59.200
in identifying these women
will be deeply,

15:59.400 --> 16:01.400
and I mean deeply, appreciated.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.360
Thank you.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.120
(reporters clamoring)

16:06.960 --> 16:08.640
Thank you.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.280
Lieutenant, thank you
for not mentioning my sister.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.560
No problem.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.280
How do you think her photograph
ended up in this gallery?

16:14.520 --> 16:15.800
Ever since
she was a little girl,

16:15.800 --> 16:16.960
she always wanted to be a star.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
She loved having
her picture taken.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.640
Okay, when was the last time
you talked to her?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.200
A few days.
Okay.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.920
Take a uniform,
go to her apartment,

16:25.920 --> 16:27.680
and go through it
with a fine-tooth comb.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.640
What am I
looking for?

16:28.640 --> 16:31.160
Anything related
to her last 24 hours.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.720
You're gonna have to
get your soundbites
somewhere else.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.640
Actually, I wanted
to ask you a favor

16:47.160 --> 16:48.680
The answer is "no."

16:48.680 --> 16:49.600
Come on, I heard
you were letting

16:49.640 --> 16:51.920
a documentary film guy
follow you around.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.760
No comment.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.440
I got to get
back to work.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.360
Boa Vista's missing sister?

16:59.680 --> 17:01.280
You're not fooling
me this time.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.000
I've already got it in deep
background that it's her sister.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.640
Ex-husband says she has two.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.119
Is it Christine
or Anya?

17:09.040 --> 17:10.520
You're literally
the worst.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.839
You know that, right?

17:12.839 --> 17:14.000
You can't release that.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.160
You could get
the girl killed.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.920
What do you want to bet
in under 20 minutes,

17:16.920 --> 17:18.240
I'll know which girl?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.400
SASHA:
Natalia?

17:30.640 --> 17:31.560
Is everything okay?

17:32.440 --> 17:34.520
She lives here.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.880
I just got back
from a tryout

17:36.920 --> 17:38.120
for a reality show--

17:38.320 --> 17:39.920
<i> South Beach Babes.</i>

17:40.320 --> 17:42.120
I think I really have
a chance this time.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.680
Where's Anya?

17:43.720 --> 17:45.560
Um, that's why I'm here.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.120
Anya's missing.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.480
When was the last time
you saw her?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.880
Um, yeah, I talked
to her two days ago.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.600
She got a callback
for a modeling shoot.

17:54.920 --> 17:55.440
She's so lucky.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.920
The guy promised
her a cover.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.480
Do you know anything
about this guy?

17:58.680 --> 18:01.400
He was, like,
really old, like 35.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.440
But, I mean, he sounded
nice on the machine.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.920
Okay.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.800
Do you mind
if I take it with me?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.080
Yeah, sure, I give out my
cell number for callbacks.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.560
I'm sure she's fine.
She's very careful.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.880
Okay, look, Sasha,
do me a favor, please.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.960
Don't go on any callbacks
until this is over.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.640
Please.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.560
Okay.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.160
But she's fine.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.280
There's nothing.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.000
Whoever these belong
to was very careful.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.000
Horatio seems to think
the guy's a photographer.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.120
That makes sense.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.800
You think that these
are color copies?

18:49.800 --> 18:52.400
No, take a look.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.600
Oh, yeah, that's pretty grainy.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.080
Rules out digital.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.880
Film is black and white.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.920
(camera clicking)

19:19.600 --> 19:22.360
Why would a photographer
prefer a low-resolution image?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.160
Going for a distinct look.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.160
There's not a lot of places that
develop black and white film.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.160
I'll go make some calls.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.680
To photo shops in Miami,

19:28.680 --> 19:30.560
the model shoot capital
of the world?

19:30.640 --> 19:31.920
(chuckles)

19:31.920 --> 19:35.040
I think you're gonna be making
a lot of phone calls.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.440
Have fun.

19:38.520 --> 19:38.520
(camera shutter clicking)

19:38.520 --> 19:40.320
MAN:
That's it, baby.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
Give me sexy.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.720
Perfect.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.560
Hold that look.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.760
All right, I want sexy,
not slutty.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.440
Come on. Give me sexy.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.680
DUQUESNE:
Did you get a name for the black
and white specialist?

19:57.680 --> 19:58.880
Well, Homicide
pointed me towards

19:58.960 --> 20:00.840
this photo developing
place downtown.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.760
All the high-end
photographers use it.

20:02.760 --> 20:03.760
It's owned by
this German guy,

20:03.760 --> 20:06.960
and he says that our man's
name is John Stockman.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.640
Calleigh Duquesne,
ueRyan Wolfe, MDPD.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.480
These girls are all of age.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.920
I've checked every one
of them out, personally.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.160
What about the photographers?
Do you check them out, as well?

20:16.880 --> 20:18.760
Look, what is this?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.160
We're looking for John Stockman.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.960
Shoots in black and white;
thinks he's Ansel Adams.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.400
Thank you.

20:32.080 --> 20:32.280
Give me sensual.

20:32.360 --> 20:32.680
(camera clicking)

20:33.040 --> 20:35.200
All these girls,
they have the wrong dreams.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.120
I don't know
that their dreams are bad,

20:37.120 --> 20:40.080
just the people who promise
to make them come true.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.800
John Stockman?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.040
Yeah, what
do you need?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.320
Your DNA.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.280
Excuse me?

20:56.800 --> 20:58.760
I don't understand
what I'm doing here.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.040
Oh, no,
I think you do.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.120
You took all the photos
of these girls.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.760
I take a lot of photos.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.920
Yeah, but your camera's
a single lens reflex.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.200
That's right.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.440
And you use dual-edge
black and white film.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.960
It gives my work detail.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.280
Hmm.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.880
And the fact that you keep these
in a safe with murder trophies

21:22.880 --> 21:24.680
in an abandoned
building--

21:24.680 --> 21:26.560
is that just a coincidence?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.680
You want to pin that on me?

21:29.120 --> 21:31.080
I hope you have proof.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.680
(cell phone ringing)

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
This is Wolfe.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.280
Yep.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.520
Your DNA matches
the semen we found

21:48.520 --> 21:51.400
in Leslie Anderson's underwear.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.440
You feeling pinned?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.160
That proves I had sex with her.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.440
It's a photographer's perk.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.680
Where'd this
little hookup occur?

22:02.080 --> 22:05.120
In her dressing room,
after the shoot.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.200
* *

22:12.640 --> 22:14.120
It was sex.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.440
Nothing criminal.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.280
Anyone could've stolen my photos

22:18.360 --> 22:19.960
and put them in that safe.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.120
Well, then I'm gonna need
a list of those "anyones."

22:25.360 --> 22:27.200
Erica Sikes reporting.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.960
Sources say there's
a personal connection

22:28.960 --> 22:31.440
at the Miami-Dade Crime Lab
to the current murder case.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.320
MDPD Criminalist

22:33.320 --> 22:36.040
Natalia Boa Vista,
this morning identified her own

22:36.040 --> 22:37.880
sister's picture
from among the photos

22:37.880 --> 22:39.120
of the missing girls.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.400
That's right.
ghtalia.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.960
One of the missing
and perhaps dead...

22:41.960 --> 22:43.040
There's something
you should know about.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.000
(cell phone rings)
What?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.040
Oh, my God.
It's my sister.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.320
Anya?
ANYA (on phone):
Natalia.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.400
Where are you?

22:48.400 --> 22:49.920
I only have a second.
I'm in a house.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.480
I think it's near the water.
I don't know...

22:51.480 --> 22:52.480
An...

23:00.000 --> 23:01.320
They're going to kill her, Ryan.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.760
Listen, no, listen.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.960
If she called, it means
she's still alive, right?

23:05.120 --> 23:06.720
So focus. What'd you get

23:06.720 --> 23:07.800
from the answering
machine?

23:08.040 --> 23:10.320
Um... nothing.
I got nothing.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.080
I have listened to this
a thousand times.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.960
There's no ambient
sound. Listen.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.360
MALE VOICE (on recorder):
Anya, it's me.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.120
Your pics are ready.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.280
These are the ones, baby.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.280
Call me.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.840
You've got the number.
See?

23:22.840 --> 23:24.120
There's no accent.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.960
I mean, this could be
any guy out there.
Not really.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.960
I think I know that voice.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.280
From where?

23:32.120 --> 23:34.640
The model shoot.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.760
Mr. Laporte,
you placed a call

23:39.760 --> 23:42.680
to Anya Boa Vista.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.080
I did?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.480
You did.
(plays tape)

23:46.800 --> 23:48.080
LAPORTE (on tape):
Anya, it's me.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.840
Your pics are ready.

23:49.840 --> 23:50.800
These are the ones, baby.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.640
Call me. You've got the number.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.560
(laughs):
Right.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.320
Yeah, her. I called her to let
her know her proofs were ready.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.520
Go on.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.840
You should really be
talking to Stockman.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.720
All right, he's the one
doing all the models.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.360
You have quite a history, too,

24:05.400 --> 24:07.280
which includes
a rape charge, doesn't it?

24:08.520 --> 24:09.840
I was acquitted.
Yes,

24:09.840 --> 24:11.840
but that doesn't mean
you're innocent.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.400
Does it?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.400
I'm just a guy
who processed her proofs.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.120
But I can help you, Lieutenant.

24:22.000 --> 24:22.720
I know what goes on

24:22.720 --> 24:24.400
between model and photographer.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.800
Describe it  me.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.080
All about fame.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.400
Hey, and these girls,
they all want it so bad.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.200
So you point a camera at them,

24:32.200 --> 24:33.440
you get them to do
whatever you want.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.760
They'll take their shirts off.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.880
They'll hop into bed
with you. Anything.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.080
That's what you did,
Mr. Laporte. Isn't it?

24:42.680 --> 24:44.160
You prove that, let me know.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.000
I guarantee it.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.000
No, no. That's too much
backlight there.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.680
To the right.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.240
To the right.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.640
Hey. News chick.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.160
Do you realize

25:12.160 --> 25:13.760
that you signed
my sister's death warrant?

25:13.960 --> 25:15.680
I know you're angry, but I'm
just reporting the facts.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.840
You tied her to law enforcement.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.200
That makes her
a primary target.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.840
DUQUESNE:
Nat.
Do you deny that?

25:20.840 --> 25:23.360
This is exactly what she wants.
Don't give it to her, okay?

25:24.240 --> 25:25.800
I'll meet you inside.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.960
You do understand where I'm
coming from, don't you?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.560
I do. I understand
you have a job to do

25:36.560 --> 25:38.120
just like the rest of us.
Thank you.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.960
I also understand
that your need for attention

25:39.960 --> 25:41.880
may have put these girls'
lives in even more danger.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.840
<i> My need for attention?
Mm-hmm.</i>

25:44.840 --> 25:47.520
You didn't just report the news;
you chose a salacious angle.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.840
That's more
attention for you.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.000
I'm a journalist.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.840
I want my attention
on my stories.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.880
If that were true, sweet pea,

25:53.920 --> 25:55.320
you'd be writing
for a newspaper

25:55.320 --> 25:58.000
not planting your face
on the evening news.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.760
Have a nice day.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.520
(elevator bell dings)

26:07.360 --> 26:08.760
Lieutenant Caine.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.840
Mr. Boyer.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.800
I just got home
and found this in the mail.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.000
It's a letter from Jill.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.960
What does it say?

26:16.960 --> 26:19.640
It says that we're through.
The wedding's off,

26:19.640 --> 26:21.560
that I shouldn't even
bother trying to find her.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.920
Man, this doesn't
sound like her.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.760
After your press conference,
I know something's wrong.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.240
Mr. Boyer, I need you to
leave that letter with me.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.080
You think it'll help?

26:34.080 --> 26:35.240
I know it's gonna help.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.440
So Horatio told me
you're processing the paper.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.920
Why aren't you in QD?

26:44.040 --> 26:45.360
'Cause I got what
I needed in there.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.120
Which was what?

26:47.120 --> 26:48.400
This paper's store-bought.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.520
It's, um... it's untraceable.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.840
But this logo's gonna help us.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.120
See that? It's embossed.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.040
So someone modified
the paper themselves?

26:58.040 --> 26:59.920
The paper passes through
and each time, uh...

27:00.320 --> 27:01.640
the sheet gets pressed.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.360
All right.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.680
Well, again, why
are we in here?

27:09.680 --> 27:11.680
Embossing machines
have many uses.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.040
I noticed there was
a little bit of trace

27:13.040 --> 27:14.960
on the outer edge
of the imprint.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.920
A little trace from
whatever was being embossed

27:16.920 --> 27:18.520
before the paper.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.120
"Trivalent chromium sulfate."

27:35.560 --> 27:37.240
That's used
in the pparation of leather.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.320
That's right; the higher
the concentration
of the tannins,

27:39.320 --> 27:40.440
the higher the quality.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.280
So whatever this business is,

27:41.280 --> 27:43.680
it deals in high-quality
leathers.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.760
I'll call Calleigh.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.520
Good afternoon, officers.
Bill Starr.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.000
Bill Starr's Custom Upholstery.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.160
No snappy catchphrase?

28:04.160 --> 28:05.800
Look around.
I don't need one.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.240
Maybe you can explain to us
why a missing girl

28:08.240 --> 28:10.200
would write a "Dear Jo"
on your letterhead.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.440
I don't know. Busy place.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.000
Hand those out like candy.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.880
What?

28:20.400 --> 28:22.360
We have our own theories.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.760
Can you read
that plate for me?

28:31.840 --> 28:34.400
It's blocked like the car
at the tollbooth.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.720
I got Anya's blood.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.560
She cut herself on purpose
so we could ID her.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.880
MAN:
Pay the toll, bitch.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.800
Who owns that car?

29:21.800 --> 29:23.320
I don't know. Uh, I forget.

29:24.040 --> 29:24.720
The guy dropped it off

29:24.720 --> 29:25.920
for reupholstery.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.840
He didn't leave his name,
only an address.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.160
I t the info inside.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.720
Oh, great. You can give
me the address.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.160
You can give him the car.

29:51.440 --> 29:52.800
Miami-Dade Police.

30:10.160 --> 30:13.560
Who is ever behind that door,
I want you to open it slowly

30:13.680 --> 30:15.600
by the count of three
or I'going

30:15.640 --> 30:17.640
to kick it down. One...

30:18.480 --> 30:21.200
Two... three.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.640
Jill?
Yes.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.440
Jill Girrard.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.240
You're okay now.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.560
Let me help you up.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.560
Jill, we know this is
incredibly difficult,

30:32.560 --> 30:34.200
but is there anything
that you can tell us

30:34.320 --> 30:35.600
about what happened?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.800
I answered an ad
to get my portrait taken.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.200
It was supposed to be

30:41.240 --> 30:43.320
an engagement gift
for my fiance.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.880
Your fiance, Tommy.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.240
The guy left a message
on my answering machine.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.640
Okay, did he leave a name?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.480
No, he just told me to meet him
at his place in the Gables.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.640
Hello?

30:58.360 --> 31:00.440
Hello?

31:00.480 --> 31:01.640
(gasps)

31:02.160 --> 31:02.840
Do you by any chance

31:02.840 --> 31:04.680
have the answering
machine message or...?

31:05.320 --> 31:06.680
I erased it.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.400
Did his voice
sound familiar?

31:08.760 --> 31:10.280
Just a guy.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.760
All I remember
is being put in a car.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.040
He had something over my head.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.120
So you couldn't identify him.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.000
What about when you
were in the car,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
did you hear noise?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.160
Could you notice
anything?

31:22.920 --> 31:24.400
There was another girl.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.560
Was it Anya?

31:25.840 --> 31:27.440
I don't know
what her name was.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.480
She couldn't stop crying;
we drove around

31:29.480 --> 31:32.160
for a bit, made a stop
and then suddenly she was gone.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.880
I figured I was next.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.480
Did he hurt you in any way?

31:42.120 --> 31:44.840
Ma'am. We're gonna get you
to the hospital.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.640
Hang in there.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.760
(indistinct radio dispatch)

32:03.080 --> 32:05.400
WOLFE:
Remember: eyes, no hands.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.320
What is it?
Do you see something?

32:33.440 --> 32:33.920
Yeah, this door

32:33.960 --> 32:35.480
locks on both sides.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.360
If you want to keep
someone in a room,

32:38.360 --> 32:40.200
why would you have it
keyed fromhe inside?

32:40.480 --> 32:42.880
Unless you want to be locked
in here with them.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.240
Sorry. I, uh, I didn't
mean to imply...

32:47.440 --> 32:49.560
No, no, um...

32:49.760 --> 32:52.600
we need to know
what we're dealing with.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.320
(clears throat)

33:08.280 --> 33:10.000
Oh, my God.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.720
Natalia, don't touch that.
Oh. Okay,
but that's Anya's.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.760
I got that for her
last Christmas.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.680
Okay, but you can't collect
evidence in this case.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.120
She was here.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.560
And we just missed her.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.800
Calleigh, honey, Horatio
asked me to check in

33:28.880 --> 33:31.120
on your victim Jill Girrard
at the hospital.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.720
Yeah, how's she doing?

33:32.760 --> 33:34.400
Well, I spoke
to the SART nurse,

33:34.400 --> 33:36.880
and she found
several contusions on Jill

33:36.880 --> 33:39.200
that were consistent
with her account of the attack.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.720
What about the
sexual assault exam?

33:41.760 --> 33:43.040
Get this.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.480
There were no
physical findings.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.040
Really?
In fact,

33:48.040 --> 33:49.440
based on the exam,

33:49.440 --> 33:52.560
she's never even had
sexual intercourse.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.240
That doesn't make sense.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.960
Why would somebody lie
about being raped?

33:56.920 --> 33:58.840
Take a look at this.

34:01.960 --> 34:04.240
She swallowed a key.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.160
HORATIO:
Miami-Dade Police

34:19.600 --> 34:21.320
(coughs)

34:27.280 --> 34:28.920
What about this one?

34:28.920 --> 34:30.840
Anya Boa Vista.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.960
I've never seen her.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.520
You weren't being held captive,
were you?

34:36.520 --> 34:38.080
What are you talking about?

34:38.080 --> 34:40.120
An abdominal x-ray shows
that you swallowed a key,

34:40.120 --> 34:42.719
and my bet is that that key
opens the lock on the boat.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.880
He told me I was special.

34:51.880 --> 34:52.960
Please.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.719
Don't.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.440
I've never done it before.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.600
That I was different
than the rest.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.600
Tell me what happened.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.240
He made me watch.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.480
Please! No!

35:22.200 --> 35:24.720
(grunting)

35:25.040 --> 35:26.640
He called me
his girlfriend.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.680
He made me write
that letter to Tommy.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.800
So Tommy wouldn't try
and find you.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.520
I was so scared.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.000
Told me to go to the boat.
Pick up a necklace.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.080
He let you go to the boat alone?
No.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.760
I was never alone.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.240
He was testing me.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.800
When the cops showed up at
the boat, I had to do something.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.280
I couldn't screw it up.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.520
So you protected him.

35:51.160 --> 35:55.640
He said bad girls
always die the slowest.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.480
What's his name?

36:01.320 --> 36:03.080
I...

36:03.200 --> 36:06.160
I can't. I'm sorry.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.880
Why me?

36:13.760 --> 36:15.800
Why did he spare me?

36:16.560 --> 36:18.600
Just be gratefull that he did.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.160
So, uh, the runaway bride,

36:28.160 --> 36:29.880
Jill, went Stockholm on us.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.240
That poor girl, man,
she's so messed up.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.560
She won't be so poor
after she signs a book deal.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.440
You think she's faking?

36:38.520 --> 36:41.040
I think she's getting her wish.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.480
To be famous?

36:42.480 --> 36:44.240
She'll be living off
of this for years.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.920
You know,
she's really traumatized.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.960
That kind of hell
she went through,

36:48.000 --> 36:49.040
it's not easy to deal with.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.120
Yeah, well,
ask Natalia about that.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.920
All I know, is this girl could
be saving Anya's life

36:53.920 --> 36:55.040
and she's not talking.

36:55.040 --> 36:55.520
Well, you know what?

36:55.560 --> 36:56.840
She's not going to tell us,

36:57.960 --> 36:59.560
maybe this car will.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.280
I got something.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.680
Some kind of rock or mineral.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.320
You mean clay?

37:22.320 --> 37:24.840
No, it's coarse.
Looks like granite.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.240
Killers have a comfort zone
for body dumps.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.120
If that's granite...

37:30.200 --> 37:32.720
There's only
one place: jetty.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.800
It's government cut.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.480
Officers, she's going
to be somewhere

37:42.480 --> 37:44.600
underneath these rocks.

37:48.640 --> 37:51.240
The tide's rising.
Let's pick up our pace.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
This quadrant's clear.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.960
Moving to the next section.

37:59.000 --> 37:59.920
Eric, we're running

37:59.920 --> 38:01.400
out of time;
this tide is rising.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.040
H, move to your right.

38:07.040 --> 38:07.920
She's two rocks over.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.040
Two rocks ahead
of you right there.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.160
Yeah, right there.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.800
She's right there.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.200
Ma'am, hang on.
Gentlemen, hurry please.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.560
Ma'am, we're going to get you
out of there right now.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.160
Who did this to you?

38:22.160 --> 38:24.320
Gavin. He's got another girl.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.440
It's got to be Anya.
Where are they?

38:26.440 --> 38:27.840
They're at the studio.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.200
(police siren blaring)

38:38.160 --> 38:39.600
(tires screeching)

39:17.400 --> 39:19.040
What you crying for?

39:19.200 --> 39:21.640
This is it. This
is what you want.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.440
This is your dream, baby.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.800
You're making
it all happen.

39:29.760 --> 39:30.440
Anya.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.840
Get on your knees.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.920
I'll make you a star.

39:41.240 --> 39:41.960
Gavin Laporte.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.520
Miami-Dade Police.
Let her go.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.280
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.520
Come on. Let's go.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.640
Move it.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.720
Help! Please

39:53.720 --> 39:56.600
I'm here, Anya.
Here I come.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.640
Let's go.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.520
That's far enough, Gavin.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.600
Now,

40:26.040 --> 40:27.000
put the gun
on the ground

40:27.040 --> 40:28.600
or I blow your brains out.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.560
Do it.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.120
OFFICER:
You're under arrest.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.080
Get him up.
Get him up.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.160
All right,
let's go.

40:43.240 --> 40:43.400
Move it.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.280
You okay, Anya?

40:49.960 --> 40:51.800
Come on.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.960
* *

41:20.480 --> 41:24.560
* *

41:29.200 --> 41:30.360
Are you mad at me?
Yes, I am

41:30.360 --> 41:31.800
so, so, so mad at you.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.880
Oh, my God. Thank you.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.680
t a problem.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.960
It's okay. It's all right.
Come on.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.880
There are more girls out there,
Gavin, and I'm nna find them.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.240
I've been all over
this country, Lieutenant.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.200
A lot of cities along the way.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.520
Take him.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.560
Miss Boa Vista.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.240
How's Anya doing?

42:25.320 --> 42:27.840
Time will tell.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.840
She's lucky to have you.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.640
Horatio...

42:35.560 --> 42:38.640
did you know that
Laporte lawyered up

42:38.640 --> 42:39.920
and that there's another case
in California?

42:39.920 --> 42:41.560
Different suspect, same MO.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.240
I'm not surprised.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.280
All those women.

42:47.680 --> 42:50.400
They could be anywhere.
Where do we start?

42:50.760 --> 42:53.280
We take it nationwide.
