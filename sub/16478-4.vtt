00:13.493 --> 00:15.393
Kermit's been playing
his heart out,

00:15.395 --> 00:17.193
and you've had your face
buried in that phone.

00:17.194 --> 00:19.561
Don't need my eyes
to enjoy the music.

00:19.563 --> 00:21.196
It's an aural experience.

00:21.198 --> 00:22.464
But no gaming on date night.

00:22.466 --> 00:24.199
That's the agreement,
remember?

00:24.201 --> 00:25.334
It's not
just a game.

00:25.336 --> 00:26.600
Plus, I'm so close
to the next level.

00:26.602 --> 00:29.337
Not if you keep playing,
you're not.

00:32.075 --> 00:35.076
Is it strange that your bossing
me around turns me on?

00:35.078 --> 00:38.479
You're a guy--
everything turns you on.

00:38.481 --> 00:39.646
Well, that's true.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.448
Help!

00:41.450 --> 00:42.549
He's hurt!

00:42.551 --> 00:43.750
He's hurt bad!

00:43.752 --> 00:44.650
Okay, slow down.

00:44.652 --> 00:46.019
- Who's hurt?
- My husband.

00:46.021 --> 00:47.653
Under the overpass.
He was attacked!

00:47.655 --> 00:50.223
Go, I'll call 911.

00:56.731 --> 00:58.365
You okay, man?

00:58.367 --> 00:59.332
What happened?

01:12.079 --> 01:13.545
Michael!

01:14.315 --> 01:15.580
Michael!

01:16.450 --> 01:17.676

Uh, guys?

01:49.013 --> 01:50.847
We got a bit of a snafu here.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.881
I've tried every
likely decryption variant.

01:52.883 --> 01:54.783
I'm open to ideas, here.

01:54.785 --> 01:56.752
Sebastian, you're our
decryption specialist.

01:56.754 --> 01:59.120
You're supposed to figure
out electronic escapes.

01:59.122 --> 02:00.221
Please call me by my game name.

02:00.223 --> 02:01.690
No way. It's stupid.

02:01.692 --> 02:03.525
You want to finish
the level or not?

02:03.527 --> 02:05.093
All right, Centauri,

02:05.095 --> 02:07.629
what are we gonna do?

02:07.631 --> 02:10.064
Well, we can't key our way out.

02:10.066 --> 02:12.567
But we can blow our way out.

02:12.569 --> 02:13.901
All right, let's see here.

02:13.903 --> 02:17.004
Uh... aerosol can... okay.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.506
And, uh...

02:18.508 --> 02:20.975
Uh-huh. Vegetable oil.

02:21.811 --> 02:22.977
Common household items
that can make

02:22.979 --> 02:25.045
a pretty powerful explosive.

02:27.115 --> 02:29.449
Ah, crap, guys, I got to go.
My mom's here.

02:29.451 --> 02:30.851
In the middle of a game?

02:30.853 --> 02:31.952
What are you, ten years old?

02:31.954 --> 02:33.954
Centauri out.

02:35.858 --> 02:37.724
Hello, peaches.
Hi, Mom.

02:37.726 --> 02:39.793
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come on, come on.

02:39.795 --> 02:41.294
It's been so long,
just say it.

02:41.296 --> 02:42.828
Hello, cream.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.130
You look like
you've lost weight.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.999
Yeah, you know, people say they
don't see it, but my shirts...

02:47.001 --> 02:48.066
- Yeah, hanging differently.
- Yeah.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.002
Yeah, and you
look pale.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.971
You been taking
your vitamins?

02:51.973 --> 02:53.680
Yeah, vitamin E,
vitamin D, folic acid.

02:53.704 --> 02:54.774
Iron?

02:54.775 --> 02:56.174
Iron is essential.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.843
You don't want to end up like

02:57.845 --> 02:59.577
Bobby Carlyle from next door.

02:59.579 --> 03:04.415
He had an iron deficiency
and then he got anemia and...

03:04.417 --> 03:05.850
Well, his life was
never the same.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.619
Ugh.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.487
Of course, he also had
that substance abuse problem.

03:09.489 --> 03:12.991
And there was
the credit card fraud incident.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.993
Jail time, started dating
his parole officer.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.394
God, it was just a mess.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.496
And it all stemmed
from a lack of iron.

03:19.498 --> 03:20.931
I... better get some iron, then.

03:20.933 --> 03:22.198
Take care of my peaches.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.467
Come on, we should go get
breakfast, work might call.

03:24.469 --> 03:25.669
But there-there's no rush...
Your mom's in town.

03:25.671 --> 03:27.470
I'm sure that work
will understand.

03:27.472 --> 03:30.173
Mom, I work at crime lab, not a
coffee shop. Come on, let's go.

03:30.175 --> 03:34.810
Well, um, but I, I...
I just got here.

03:34.812 --> 03:36.812
Hold your horses, honey.

03:36.814 --> 03:37.967
- Your hoodie.
- I don't...

03:37.968 --> 03:39.617
It might get chilly.
Now, just...

03:39.618 --> 03:41.317
- You know that I know best.
- Right.

03:41.853 --> 03:44.253
Gregorio!

03:44.255 --> 03:45.721
How you doing
this fine morning?

03:45.723 --> 03:47.723
Still in New Orleans,
so there's that.

03:47.725 --> 03:49.725
Where's the FBI
monkey suit?

03:49.727 --> 03:50.992
What is it,
Casual Tuesdays?

03:50.994 --> 03:52.661
No, it's “mind your
own business every day”,

03:52.663 --> 03:54.062
when it comes
to me, Lasalle.

03:54.064 --> 03:56.064
Don't worry, we'll help
you root out the cartel

03:56.066 --> 03:57.131
in our fine city.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.200
You'll be
on your way back to DC.

03:59.202 --> 04:01.269
Man, from your lips
to God's ears.

04:01.271 --> 04:02.971
Bagels here suck.

04:02.973 --> 04:06.041
Got to try Stein's,
best in the South.

04:08.744 --> 04:09.843
Suit at the cleaners?

04:09.845 --> 04:11.278
Casual Tuesdays.

04:13.449 --> 04:14.181
No Percy?

04:14.183 --> 04:15.549
No, she had
to go home.

04:15.551 --> 04:16.750
Thank you.
Stepfather's sick.

04:16.752 --> 04:18.118
Didn't think
they got along.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.452
They don't.

04:19.454 --> 04:20.988
But her mama
needs a hand.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.523
Come on, things
to show you.

04:25.226 --> 04:27.560
Lieutenant Michael Reid.

04:27.562 --> 04:28.728
NFO out of Belle Chase.

04:28.730 --> 04:29.896
NF what now?

04:29.898 --> 04:32.431
NFO-- Naval Flight Officer.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.166
Grabbed last night
in front of his wife.

04:34.168 --> 04:37.470
Male and female suspects
lured him to their van.

04:37.472 --> 04:38.571
Took off.

04:38.573 --> 04:40.239
Homeless man found him
this a.m.

04:40.241 --> 04:42.207
Was the perfect
dumping spot.

04:42.209 --> 04:43.875
Place has been abandoned
since Katrina.

04:43.877 --> 04:45.477
Know anything
about the suspects?

04:45.479 --> 04:47.879
Reid's wife sat
with a sketch artist.

04:47.881 --> 04:50.682
Described the van, too.

04:50.684 --> 04:53.418
BOLOs are out, Patton's running
the sketches through Bruce.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.053
All right,
so what are we looking at?

04:55.055 --> 04:56.554
It wasn't robbery.

04:56.556 --> 04:57.956
He's got a wallet.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.524
Cell phone, watch were
still on the body.

05:00.526 --> 05:01.592
That's kidnapping, then.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.761
Yeah, well,
that's what it appears.

05:03.763 --> 05:07.564
And he's got ligature abrasions
on the ankles and wrists.

05:07.566 --> 05:08.432
He was bound.

05:10.503 --> 05:12.569
Several fingernails removed.

05:12.571 --> 05:15.606
He has puncture wounds
on his thorax and abdomen.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.007
Likely cause of death.

05:17.009 --> 05:18.908
So he was tortured?

05:18.910 --> 05:19.943
Yeah.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.945
Why torture Reid?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.813
Do these NFOs have access

05:23.815 --> 05:25.515
to classified
information?

05:25.517 --> 05:28.084
They work with airborne weapons
and navigation systems.

05:28.086 --> 05:30.053
We need to reach out
to his commanding officer.

05:30.055 --> 05:31.721
Find out what he
was working on.

05:31.723 --> 05:33.488
Your lab tech's
Sebastian Lund, right?

05:33.490 --> 05:35.124
Yes, why?

05:35.126 --> 05:37.860
Lieutenant Reid called him
three times last night.

05:42.466 --> 05:43.711
... 12 hours,
but it's only...

05:43.735 --> 05:44.634
12 hours?

05:44.635 --> 05:47.002
Hi, Evette, how you doing?

05:47.004 --> 05:48.771
Uh, I just want
the usual, please.

05:48.773 --> 05:51.472
Egg white omelet
with Swiss, spinach, tomato.

05:51.474 --> 05:54.175
Uh, and please make sure there
are no yolks in his eggs.

05:54.177 --> 05:55.777
My son has an allergy.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.611
He breaks out in hives.

05:57.613 --> 05:58.780
Okay, Th-Th-that happened once

05:58.782 --> 05:59.981
and it was in middle school.

05:59.983 --> 06:01.683
Yeah, but the hives
were everywhere.

06:01.685 --> 06:03.551
And I mean everywhere.
You were in

06:03.553 --> 06:04.752
so much discomfort.

06:04.754 --> 06:06.120
No, you couldn't even
put clothes on.

06:06.122 --> 06:08.421
Just lay there naked
on the living room couch.

06:08.423 --> 06:10.023
You remember that?

06:10.025 --> 06:11.457
I do now.
I'm just saying

06:11.459 --> 06:12.693
better safe than sorry.

06:12.695 --> 06:14.061
Hm?
Uh...

06:14.063 --> 06:16.663
I'll just have the
oatmeal, please.

06:16.665 --> 06:18.665
Thanks so much.
Thanks a lot.

06:20.903 --> 06:22.468
You know, she'd be a pretty girl

06:22.470 --> 06:24.536
if she didn't have
all that gunk on her face.

06:24.538 --> 06:26.105
I like the gunk on her face.

06:26.107 --> 06:28.107
Sort of thinking of asking her
out before you gave her

06:28.109 --> 06:29.508
my whole medical history.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

06:29.510 --> 06:30.710
She's not your type.

06:30.712 --> 06:31.877
Yeah,

06:31.879 --> 06:33.713
she's probably got
a full body tattoo.

06:33.715 --> 06:35.380
Yeah... probably.

06:37.051 --> 06:38.417
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.

06:38.419 --> 06:40.004
This is work.
I got to take it.

06:40.028 --> 06:41.420
Oh, well.

06:41.421 --> 06:44.989
Pride, remind me I can never
show my face at Surrey's again.

06:44.991 --> 06:46.591
Let's talk about that later.

06:46.593 --> 06:48.593
Do you know
Lieutenant Michael Reid?

06:48.595 --> 06:50.461
Uh, yeah, he's a, he's a friend
of mine. Why?

06:50.463 --> 06:52.496
He called you three times
last night?

06:52.498 --> 06:54.465
- How do you know that?
- Sir, please!

06:54.467 --> 06:56.067
I need your help!
My husband,

06:56.069 --> 06:58.435
he was attacked!
I think he's hurt bad.

06:58.437 --> 07:00.070
Can you please come?
Oh, my God, yeah, sure!

07:00.072 --> 07:01.705
- Pride, I-I got to call you back!
- Sebastian!

07:01.707 --> 07:03.073
Do not go with that woman!

07:04.844 --> 07:06.744
Sebastian!

07:06.746 --> 07:07.978
Okay, all right, uh,
uh, don't worry, I'm gonna...

07:07.980 --> 07:10.080
I'm gonna call
an ambulance, all right?

07:10.082 --> 07:11.181
Aah!

07:35.975 --> 07:38.042
Ms. Lund?

07:38.044 --> 07:40.144
Ms. Lund,
NCIS Special Agents

07:40.146 --> 07:41.879
Pride and Lasalle.
We're looking for your son.

07:41.881 --> 07:44.581
I knew it.
I knew something was wrong.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.115
My ex will tell you

07:46.117 --> 07:47.351
that I always think
something's wrong.

07:47.353 --> 07:48.852
And m-maybe that's true.

07:48.854 --> 07:50.987
You know, I have been
known to overreact. I...

07:50.989 --> 07:52.789
I have anxiety.
I was on medication,

07:52.791 --> 07:54.290
but then I...
It was making me drowsy,

07:54.292 --> 07:55.859
so I decided that I should

07:55.861 --> 07:57.026
just stop taking...
Could you give us a moment?

07:57.028 --> 07:57.994
Absolutely.

07:57.996 --> 08:00.029
Oh... geez.

08:00.031 --> 08:02.197
Okay, everything
that I have ever worried about

08:02.199 --> 08:03.999
is all happening now.

08:04.001 --> 08:06.435
It's okay Ms. Lund. Just
take a breath. What happened?

08:06.437 --> 08:09.372
I told the officer
we were having breakfast.

08:09.374 --> 08:12.708
Sebastian took the call
and then... he was gone.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.561
Uh, when he was outside,
was he approached by this woman?

08:14.585 --> 08:15.211
I-I don't know,

08:15.212 --> 08:18.246
I didn't see anything.
What happened to my son?

08:18.248 --> 08:20.014
We don't know if anything's
happened to him.

08:20.016 --> 08:22.884
I-I appreciate you saying that
for my benefit.

08:22.886 --> 08:25.119
But you wouldn't be here
if there wasn't a problem.

08:25.121 --> 08:27.722
I see where Sebastian
got his intelligence from.

08:27.724 --> 08:30.425
And also a penchant
for bruising.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.025
Like his mother.

08:32.028 --> 08:34.095
You have to find him.
He's one of my people,

08:34.097 --> 08:36.996
one of my team, Mrs. Lund.
We'll find him, I promise.

08:36.999 --> 08:37.575
All right.

08:37.599 --> 08:39.166
Officer Clark's
gonna give you a ride.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.333
Soon as we find out more,
we'll let you know.

08:41.336 --> 08:43.537
Thank you.

08:47.376 --> 08:49.576
Witnesses say
they saw an agitated woman

08:49.578 --> 08:50.944
approach Sebastian.

08:50.946 --> 08:52.077
Just like Lieutenant Reid.

08:52.079 --> 08:53.112
Yeah. She led him off

08:53.114 --> 08:54.246
in this direction.

08:54.248 --> 08:56.181
Get the witnesses the sketches.

08:56.183 --> 08:57.717
All right.
All right?

08:57.719 --> 09:00.787
And then pull surveillance
footage in the area.

09:00.789 --> 09:02.422
I'm on it.

09:02.424 --> 09:04.590
I'll get Gregorio
to lend a hand, too.

09:06.327 --> 09:07.927
Come on, Sebastian.

09:07.929 --> 09:09.294
I don't think he's gonna answer.

09:12.466 --> 09:14.265
Wait a minute.

09:14.267 --> 09:16.301
You hear that?

09:20.474 --> 09:22.674
Sebastian's phone.

09:27.279 --> 09:29.346
There's blood on it.

09:29.348 --> 09:31.882
What the hell is happening here?

09:31.884 --> 09:33.884
<i>Sebastian been kidnapped?</i>

09:33.886 --> 09:35.753
Well, what are we doing?
Come, we got to hit the streets.

09:35.755 --> 09:37.020
Let's go.
No, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

09:37.022 --> 09:38.355
We don't know where to go.

09:38.357 --> 09:40.858
We can't just sit here.
Hey...

09:40.860 --> 09:43.125
- we're gonna find him.
- Hey.

09:43.127 --> 09:45.495
NOPD tracked down the van

09:45.497 --> 09:47.797
used to grab Lt. Reid
and Sebastian.

09:47.799 --> 09:49.899
That's good news.
Don't get too excited.

09:49.901 --> 09:52.368
The suspects
dumped and burned it.

09:52.370 --> 09:54.136
No evidence.

09:55.273 --> 09:57.273
So we start at the beginning.

09:57.275 --> 09:59.275
Kidnappers took Lt. Reid.

09:59.277 --> 10:00.742
Has to be a reason why.

10:00.744 --> 10:02.143
Best way to
find Sebastian

10:02.145 --> 10:05.146
is to figure out how
he and Reid connect.

10:05.148 --> 10:07.015
Sebastian said they're friends.

10:07.017 --> 10:08.283
You ever heard of him?

10:08.285 --> 10:10.519
I never heard him mention Reid.
Okay.

10:10.521 --> 10:12.454
So we dig in like
any other case.

10:12.456 --> 10:15.323
Credit cards, e-mails,
everything on Reid

10:15.325 --> 10:17.458
and Sebastian.
Find their connection point.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.326
We should start
at Sebastian's apartment.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.828
Never been.

10:20.830 --> 10:22.497
Man worked with you
all these years,

10:22.499 --> 10:24.365
never been to his place?
Come on,

10:24.367 --> 10:26.033
I got a spare key.

10:28.538 --> 10:30.824
We got to get that van
back to the lab.

10:30.825 --> 10:31.374
Pride,

10:31.375 --> 10:34.040
no forensic expert in the world
could trace it now.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.408
Sebastian could.

10:35.410 --> 10:37.811
Listen, all I'm saying

10:37.813 --> 10:39.813
is we got to think
outside the box.

10:39.815 --> 10:42.816
FBI's got a new
vehicle geotracking program.

10:42.818 --> 10:45.251
Uses satellites to tap into
the vehicle's Bluetooth.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.554
Tracks where
the vehicle's going.

10:47.556 --> 10:50.356
But also where it's been?
Yes.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.457
How many hoops we got to
jump through for access?

10:52.459 --> 10:54.192
Let's find out.

11:01.101 --> 11:02.968
Hey, hey.

11:02.970 --> 11:05.938
Wake up. Wake up.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.472
Hey.

11:07.474 --> 11:10.408
Wake up.

11:12.211 --> 11:15.112
Wha...

11:15.114 --> 11:16.814
Wha-What's going on?
Where am I?

11:16.816 --> 11:18.115
Keep your voice down.

11:18.117 --> 11:20.184
Listen, I don't
know anything.

11:20.186 --> 11:21.419
Man and a woman

11:21.421 --> 11:23.821
took me this morning,
brought me here.

11:23.823 --> 11:25.422
Didn't say a word.

11:25.424 --> 11:27.157
Department of Corrections?

11:27.159 --> 11:29.259
I'm a guard.

11:29.261 --> 11:31.028
Shh. They're coming.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.200
Uh... yeah, I, uh,

11:37.202 --> 11:39.870
I don't know what's
going on here, but, uh,

11:39.872 --> 11:41.237
I think-I think maybe
we should talk, right? Right?

11:41.239 --> 11:42.538
I think there's
been some kind...

11:42.540 --> 11:43.573
Or-or we don't talk.

11:43.575 --> 11:44.874
That's fine, too.

11:44.876 --> 11:46.241
You're gonna help us, Sebastian.

11:46.243 --> 11:49.244
Otherwise you end up dead
like Lieutenant Reid.

11:49.246 --> 11:50.512
And Henry over here.

11:50.514 --> 11:52.314
No, no, no, no, no!

11:52.316 --> 11:54.216
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, you just

11:54.218 --> 11:56.652
shot that guy, that's insane!

11:56.654 --> 11:58.087
Look at me, Sebastian.

11:59.155 --> 12:00.755
Calm down.

12:00.757 --> 12:01.957
Wait, wait, wait,
what's she doing?

12:01.959 --> 12:04.292
Take deep breaths.

12:05.095 --> 12:06.895
In...

12:06.897 --> 12:08.196
and out.

12:09.132 --> 12:11.066
That's good.

12:11.068 --> 12:12.133
Don't move.

12:12.135 --> 12:14.002
That... What is this?
Relax,

12:14.004 --> 12:15.203
she's cleaning you up.

12:17.206 --> 12:19.773
What...

12:20.810 --> 12:22.275
Listen,

12:22.277 --> 12:23.510
you should all know that-that

12:23.512 --> 12:25.278
I'm in law enforcement,
s-sort of.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.844
Okay, I-I work for
Jefferson Parish.

12:26.869 --> 12:27.910
Look at me.

12:30.119 --> 12:32.119
We know everything about you.

12:32.121 --> 12:33.385
What you do.

12:33.387 --> 12:34.587
Where you live.

12:34.589 --> 12:37.023
Who you care about.

12:38.459 --> 12:41.327
Your associate, Loretta Wade,
for instance.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.163
Owns a home in Tremé.

12:44.165 --> 12:45.798
Has two adopted sons.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.936
And your mother's in town.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.470
Staying
at the Monteleone.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.072
Room 1113.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.643
You don't want us to hurt them.
No.

12:57.645 --> 12:59.410
No, no, no. I'll-I'll...

12:59.412 --> 13:00.578
I'll do whatever you want.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.280
I know you will.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.951
And what we want...

13:05.953 --> 13:08.619
is for you to help us
to break someone out of prison.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.861
We tapped into the suspect van's
Bluetooth to track

13:16.863 --> 13:19.329
every location it made
in the last 24 hours.

13:19.331 --> 13:23.134
Geotracker's tagged 32 unique
locations where the van stopped.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.101
We don't have time
to check 'em all.

13:25.103 --> 13:26.469
Longer they got Sebastian,
more likely

13:26.471 --> 13:28.071
he ends up like Lieutenant Reid.

13:28.073 --> 13:29.539
I haven't finished
wowing you yet.

13:29.541 --> 13:31.340
Program's cross-checking

13:31.342 --> 13:32.909
the locations
for multiple stops.

13:32.911 --> 13:34.010
We might be able to find

13:34.012 --> 13:35.145
where they're keeping him.

13:40.285 --> 13:43.218
There's a reason why we don't
have permanent partners at FBI.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.853
Helps objectivity,

13:44.855 --> 13:46.822
especially in
situations like this.

13:46.824 --> 13:48.791
Yeah, well, I like
having skin in the game.

13:48.793 --> 13:52.027
Means you'll do whatever
it takes to get the job done.

13:52.029 --> 13:55.564
Like using FBI resources
without permission.

13:55.566 --> 13:56.999
The geotracker?

13:57.001 --> 13:59.000
Well... system's
not even active yet.

13:59.002 --> 14:00.334
We're just, uh...

14:00.336 --> 14:02.203
giving it a test run.
Mm-hmm.

14:02.205 --> 14:05.740
Director Isler sign off
on the test run?

14:05.742 --> 14:08.275
Would you have asked
for permission?

14:09.312 --> 14:11.378
Our methods starting
to rub off on you.

14:11.380 --> 14:12.980
Nah, I wouldn't read into it.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.381
I'm just trying
to help you out.

14:15.383 --> 14:17.550
All right, here we go.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.952
Four more hits on the van,

14:18.954 --> 14:20.153
all in the same location.

14:20.155 --> 14:22.689
Market Street
Power Plant.

14:23.525 --> 14:24.858
Thank you.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.993
Thank me when we
get your guy back.

14:33.134 --> 14:35.267
<i>This is weird, man.</i>

14:35.269 --> 14:37.203
I've hacked a lot
of computers in this job,

14:37.205 --> 14:38.604
but almost never a friend's.

14:38.606 --> 14:40.005
Almost never?

14:40.007 --> 14:42.474
Recreational hacking
doesn't count.

14:42.476 --> 14:45.310
Well, I don't like snooping
in Sebastian's personal life

14:45.312 --> 14:47.213
anymore than you,
but if it helps us

14:47.215 --> 14:49.147
get him back...
When we

14:49.149 --> 14:51.216
do get him back, I'm gonna talk
to him about these prehistoric

14:51.218 --> 14:53.414
firewalls. Man,
they're a joke.

14:53.439 --> 14:53.920
Maybe you should

14:53.921 --> 14:56.855
talk to him about
getting a hobby, too.

14:56.857 --> 15:00.191
Or getting rid
of some of this stuff.

15:00.193 --> 15:02.193
I mean, what is this?

15:02.195 --> 15:05.263
Worth a fortune on the Internet,
that's what it is.

15:05.265 --> 15:07.297
Sebastian's a man
of many pursuits.

15:09.301 --> 15:13.971
Huh. I didn't know
he liked college football.

15:13.973 --> 15:16.506
When'd he become an Alabama fan?
He's not.

15:16.508 --> 15:18.208
He just wanted
to get tighter with you.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.246
Well, how about that?

15:23.248 --> 15:24.747
Hey, man,

15:24.749 --> 15:26.348
we are gonna
get him back, right?

15:26.350 --> 15:28.951
You're damn straight.

15:28.953 --> 15:31.988
And I'm in.

15:31.990 --> 15:35.925
All right, run a search
on anything related to Lt. Reid.

15:35.927 --> 15:37.994
<i>Escape Proof?</i>

15:37.996 --> 15:41.830
MMPVR-- massive multi-player
virtual reality.

15:41.832 --> 15:44.565
A video game?

15:44.567 --> 15:46.101
Your avatar's
locked in worlds

15:46.103 --> 15:48.236
that's basically
impossible to escape from.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.905
I'm talking
Mensa-level difficult.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.339
Oh, man. So,
the player's

15:51.341 --> 15:53.374
supposed to break out?
That's cool.

15:53.376 --> 15:54.843
Huge in the gaming world.

15:54.845 --> 15:56.111
Everyone is geeking out over it.

15:56.113 --> 15:57.812
But the government
is up in it, too.

15:57.814 --> 15:59.947
NSA, CIA, NASA--

15:59.949 --> 16:01.282
they're all looking for talent.

16:01.284 --> 16:02.449
All right, sounds like

16:02.451 --> 16:03.951
right up Sebastian's alley.

16:03.953 --> 16:05.152
Yeah, he's obsessed.

16:05.154 --> 16:07.054
But I guess
it paid off.

16:07.056 --> 16:09.290
'Cause he's the number-two
ranked player in Louisiana.

16:09.292 --> 16:11.859
And Lieutenant
Reid's first.

16:11.861 --> 16:14.727
So the kidnappers took Reid
to use his <i>Escape Proof</i> skills,

16:14.729 --> 16:17.330
and then when he refused
they turned to Sebastian?

16:17.332 --> 16:20.599
But what would they possibly
want to use those skills for?

16:27.175 --> 16:28.541
Go.

16:45.326 --> 16:47.392
Pride!

16:50.363 --> 16:52.529
Is that...

16:54.167 --> 16:55.233
No.

16:55.235 --> 16:57.401
N...

16:57.403 --> 17:00.271
No, no, no.

17:02.876 --> 17:04.907
I don't think so.

17:04.910 --> 17:06.877
Sebastian's not married.

17:06.878 --> 17:08.211
Okay.

17:09.481 --> 17:11.646
Well, then where the hell is he?

17:20.192 --> 17:21.557
Exercise only!

17:21.559 --> 17:23.325
I want no talking.

17:30.501 --> 17:32.634
How you doing, Mike?

17:41.144 --> 17:42.343
Hey, Perotti.

17:43.213 --> 17:44.412
Put your ID in.

17:44.414 --> 17:46.847
Oh, right, yeah. Um,

17:46.849 --> 17:48.082
that's me.

17:48.084 --> 17:50.418
Um, Henry P-Perotti.

17:52.889 --> 17:55.156
Sorry. It's his first day.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.624
I'm so nervous.

17:58.427 --> 18:01.194
Told you to keep
your mouth shut.

18:01.196 --> 18:03.096
I just... I blurt things out
when I'm nervous, okay?

18:03.098 --> 18:05.065
It's a condition. It hasn't
officially been diagnosed,

18:05.067 --> 18:07.067
officially diag...
Shut up.

18:08.404 --> 18:10.037
I can't do this, okay?

18:10.039 --> 18:11.805
Prisons like this, they
have-they have multi-layered

18:11.807 --> 18:13.372
digital security networks.
I can't just wave a wand

18:13.374 --> 18:15.174
and unlock every door
in the building.

18:15.176 --> 18:17.276
You're one of the few people
in the country who can.

18:17.278 --> 18:20.279
You escaped from virtual prisons
with higher security than this.

18:20.281 --> 18:21.981
And remember

18:21.983 --> 18:23.282
what happens to your mother

18:23.284 --> 18:25.251
and Dr. Wade if you fail.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.017
What do we know, Christopher?

18:46.019 --> 18:47.818
Lot of questions,
not many answers.

18:47.820 --> 18:51.122
Lieutenant Reid was kidnapped,
tortured to death, then dumped.

18:51.124 --> 18:53.156
Sebastian was kidnapped
by the same two suspects

18:53.158 --> 18:54.857
as Lieutenant Reid.

18:54.859 --> 18:56.359
No idea what's happened
to him since.

18:56.361 --> 18:57.693
Yeah, we know he's still alive.

18:57.695 --> 18:58.861
Ms. Loretta confirmed

18:58.863 --> 19:00.696
that the burned body
you guys found

19:00.698 --> 19:03.066
at the Power Plant
is not Sebastian.

19:03.068 --> 19:04.300
Which means,

19:04.302 --> 19:06.869
for now, we can assume
Sebastian's okay.

19:06.871 --> 19:09.138
Okay, but we still need
an ID on the body.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.305
Well, it's gonna take a minute,

19:10.307 --> 19:12.874
especially
without Sebastian to run DNA.

19:12.876 --> 19:14.209
We're not any closer
to understanding

19:14.211 --> 19:17.246
why they were taken
in the first place.

19:17.248 --> 19:18.847
The best lead we got
is this game.

19:18.849 --> 19:20.149
<i>Escape Proof.</i>

19:20.151 --> 19:22.151
Lieutenant Reid and Sebastian
played it.

19:22.153 --> 19:23.585
That's their connection.

19:23.587 --> 19:25.120
Well, we need to know
more about it.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.820
Patton's digging in it.

19:26.822 --> 19:28.322
He's trying to find a list
of players in the area,

19:28.324 --> 19:31.125
but, basically,
it's a Hail Mary.

19:31.127 --> 19:32.560
It's still our best bet

19:32.562 --> 19:34.728
to finding and ID-ing
the suspects.

19:34.730 --> 19:37.031
Look.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.832
I know this is hard.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.468
We got to stay focused.

19:42.072 --> 19:43.836
Give him a hand.
I'll check in with Loretta.

19:43.838 --> 19:45.138
You got it.

19:46.975 --> 19:49.176
You really think
Sebastian's okay?

19:50.245 --> 19:52.345
I got to.

19:53.782 --> 19:56.049
Have you found
my son yet?

20:01.189 --> 20:03.989
Chamomile,
might do you some good.

20:03.991 --> 20:05.057
Oh, I-I don't drink tea.

20:05.059 --> 20:06.825
Esophageal sensitivity.

20:06.827 --> 20:09.128
Not diagnosed,
but still, I think...

20:09.130 --> 20:11.197
Mrs. Lund.

20:12.032 --> 20:13.699
You're worried about your son.

20:13.701 --> 20:16.902
I am always worried
about my son.

20:16.904 --> 20:19.471
Only this time, I have
a real reason to be.

20:19.473 --> 20:22.240
NCIS, NOPD and FBI

20:22.242 --> 20:24.209
are all working
to find Sebastian.

20:24.211 --> 20:26.944
Have you learned anything
since this morning

20:26.946 --> 20:29.147
when you told me that
he was gonna be okay?

20:29.149 --> 20:32.383
Obviously,
not much... yet.

20:32.385 --> 20:36.120
But we have some
promising leads.

20:36.122 --> 20:39.055
All right, have you looked at
the statistics on kidnapping?

20:39.057 --> 20:41.325
Because I have, and I
really wish that I hadn't.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.059
Every moment that passes,

20:43.061 --> 20:46.430
something horrible could
be happening to him.

20:48.434 --> 20:51.300
I've worked with your son
for a while now.

20:51.302 --> 20:54.137
He's a smart, resourceful
member of my team.

20:54.139 --> 20:55.771
He knows how to look
after himself.

20:55.773 --> 20:59.775
Well, of course he's
smart and resourceful.

20:59.777 --> 21:02.745
And he admires you very much.

21:02.747 --> 21:06.282
You are a Federal Agent.

21:06.284 --> 21:08.183
He is a lab technician.

21:08.185 --> 21:09.984
He's not prepared
for any of this.

21:09.986 --> 21:12.154
Let's not underestimate him.

21:13.757 --> 21:17.592
Those are very kind words,
Agent Pride.

21:17.594 --> 21:19.361
But what are you going
to say to me

21:19.363 --> 21:21.963
if something happens
to Sebastian?

21:28.971 --> 21:31.138
<i>Just passing through.</i>

21:31.140 --> 21:32.406
Don't talk to anyone.

21:32.408 --> 21:35.209
Don't look at anyone.

21:38.414 --> 21:40.881
That-that the guy?

21:40.883 --> 21:43.049
You really don't get this
no talking thing.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.051
Maybe, in all your
research about me,

21:45.053 --> 21:46.386
you didn't realize that
I kind of have a problem

21:46.388 --> 21:48.020
dealing with... pressure.

21:48.022 --> 21:49.689
All right? Hi.

21:49.691 --> 21:51.857
The more you tell me, the
calmer I'll feel, okay?

21:51.859 --> 21:53.259
The better I'll
be able to help.

21:53.261 --> 21:54.860
The more well-oiled this
whole thing's gonna be.

21:54.862 --> 21:56.128
Right now I feel like...
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

21:56.130 --> 21:57.597
Watch it.

21:57.599 --> 21:59.198
Uh, this is really
gonna dry out your skin.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.732
Okay, it's got like...

22:00.734 --> 22:02.734
Just... Or I can keep
doing stuff like that.

22:02.736 --> 22:04.035
However you want
to play it.

22:04.037 --> 22:06.971
Okay, you made
your point.

22:06.973 --> 22:10.141
The prisoner on the stairs
is who we're breaking out.

22:10.143 --> 22:12.143
It's happening now.

22:12.145 --> 22:14.813
Um... I'm sorry.

22:14.815 --> 22:17.582
You mean, you mean “now”,
as in, as in right now?

22:17.584 --> 22:20.318
He's being transferred to
another facility tonight.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.785
No other choice.

22:21.787 --> 22:24.355
You know that these things
take planning, okay?

22:24.357 --> 22:27.658
Research. Prison breaks
aren't just spontaneous.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.126
This one will be.

22:30.196 --> 22:32.697
The old security hub.

22:32.699 --> 22:34.631
Equipment isn't
operational,

22:34.633 --> 22:37.153
but the wiring's still connected
to the prison's current system.

22:38.036 --> 22:39.202
And?

22:39.204 --> 22:41.070
You're gonna hack in.

22:41.072 --> 22:44.107
With this.

22:45.844 --> 22:47.210
You're kidding, right?

22:47.212 --> 22:49.178
Your friend Reid talked us
through it...

22:49.180 --> 22:50.912
As long as he could talk.

22:50.914 --> 22:52.348
Said you can
access the system.

22:52.350 --> 22:53.949
Take control of the
electronic locks,

22:53.951 --> 22:56.619
cameras... create
safe passage.

22:56.621 --> 22:58.721
Theoretically, yeah, but...

22:58.723 --> 23:01.089
You-you understand that the
escapes Reid and I pulled off,

23:01.091 --> 23:02.725
those were pretend.

23:02.727 --> 23:06.729
But this... isn't.

23:06.731 --> 23:08.896
Reid said it was possible.

23:08.898 --> 23:11.733
You'll make it happen.

23:11.735 --> 23:14.302
All right.

23:14.304 --> 23:17.171
Okay, if I, if I can do this,

23:17.173 --> 23:19.641
you don't kill me and you don't
hurt anyone else, right?

23:19.643 --> 23:21.709
Right.

23:21.711 --> 23:25.211
Novak,
we need you on Tier 3, now!

23:25.213 --> 23:27.213
Get to it.

23:27.215 --> 23:29.516
Copy that.
On my way.

23:35.023 --> 23:37.291
<i>It took a little longer</i>
<i>than normal</i>

23:37.293 --> 23:39.058
without Sebastian here,

23:39.060 --> 23:41.860
but we have DNA
on our John Doe.

23:41.862 --> 23:43.696
Henry Perotti.

23:43.698 --> 23:45.364
- Prison guard.
- Scheduled to start a new job

23:45.366 --> 23:47.800
at Lafitte Federal Penitentiary.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.234
This is meaningful,
right, Dwayne?

23:49.236 --> 23:50.869
It can be of some use?

23:50.871 --> 23:52.004
Could be.

23:52.006 --> 23:53.806
Sebastian and Reid
may have been grabbed

23:53.808 --> 23:57.743
because of their connection
to this <i>Escape Proof</i> game.

23:57.745 --> 24:00.111
Now a prison guard is dead.
Yeah.

24:00.113 --> 24:04.349
Yeah, it's possible something's
happening at Lafitte prison.

24:04.351 --> 24:06.851
Warden's a friend of mine.

24:06.853 --> 24:08.853
I'll call him.

24:08.855 --> 24:12.156
Carl, it's Dwayne.

24:12.158 --> 24:14.091
Calling about one of your
guards. Henry Perotti.

24:14.093 --> 24:15.726
Sorry to tell you,

24:15.728 --> 24:19.996
but we think we found his body
this morning, and...

24:19.998 --> 24:21.398
You sure?

24:21.400 --> 24:24.067
Yeah, I-I-I'll call you back.

24:24.069 --> 24:26.737
He says Perotti clocked in
for work today.

24:26.739 --> 24:27.838
What?

24:33.712 --> 24:35.044
Sebastian.

24:35.046 --> 24:36.779
Ah, Pride.
Thank God you picked up.

24:36.781 --> 24:37.980
Hey, Loretta.

24:37.982 --> 24:39.349
Are you okay, dear?

24:39.351 --> 24:40.916
For the moment, right now, yeah.

24:40.918 --> 24:42.151
We'll see how long that lasts.

24:42.153 --> 24:44.186
Is that a guard uniform?
Yeah, listen,

24:44.188 --> 24:46.155
I-I-I found a back door
to the prison's Internet,

24:46.157 --> 24:47.690
but I don't have a lot of time.

24:47.692 --> 24:49.091
Okay, you're
at Lafitte, all right?

24:49.093 --> 24:50.759
Just sit tight.
I'll call the warden.

24:50.761 --> 24:51.926
I'm coming to get you.

24:51.928 --> 24:53.228
No, no, no, no, no.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.295
You can't call anyone.
You can't save me.

24:54.297 --> 24:55.964
All right?
Not yet, at least.

24:55.966 --> 24:57.833
You got to let me break
someone out of here first.

24:57.835 --> 24:59.167
Sebastian, what are you saying?

24:59.169 --> 25:01.770
Who are you trying to break out?
I've got a plan.

25:01.772 --> 25:03.605
Just, Pride, I need you to be
waiting outside of the pri--

25:04.975 --> 25:06.307
Damn it, Novak's coming back.
I'm out of time.

25:06.309 --> 25:07.742
Just trust me, guys.
If you try to stop this,

25:07.744 --> 25:09.109
they're gonna kill me.

25:24.447 --> 25:25.846
Well...

25:25.848 --> 25:28.482
I just feel absolutely
useless here.

25:28.484 --> 25:30.251
Isn't there anything
I can do to help?

25:30.253 --> 25:31.586
You just sit tight, Loretta.

25:31.588 --> 25:33.487
Everything's gonna be fine.

25:33.489 --> 25:35.590
Uh, never mind.
I found something.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.033
Sorry. I'm-I'm intruding.

25:47.035 --> 25:48.167
I know I shouldn't be here.

25:48.169 --> 25:49.603
I just-- I wanted to see it,

25:49.605 --> 25:51.371
you know...

25:53.174 --> 25:55.174
You're Dr. Wade,
aren't you?

25:55.176 --> 25:56.409
That's right.

25:56.411 --> 25:58.143
And your Mrs. Lund.

25:58.145 --> 26:00.412
I've heard so
much about you, just...

26:00.414 --> 26:03.249
I feel like I know you.

26:03.251 --> 26:05.284
Mrs. Lund.

26:05.286 --> 26:07.753
Oh, Sylvia, please.

26:07.755 --> 26:10.188
Uh, Sylvia, would
you mind to let go?

26:10.190 --> 26:11.790
I can't breathe.

26:11.792 --> 26:15.393
I'm-I'm so sorry.
Of course, I'm...

26:17.797 --> 26:22.300
You know, I always thought
that-that he would be a doctor

26:22.302 --> 26:25.202
or a, or a scientist, but...

26:25.204 --> 26:28.473
Choosing law enforcement,
I-I just never...

26:28.475 --> 26:30.808
I never understood it.

26:30.810 --> 26:33.310
Well, it's not something
you choose,

26:33.312 --> 26:35.812
it's a calling, really.

26:35.814 --> 26:39.783
I spent his entire life telling
him to be careful.

26:39.785 --> 26:42.152
You know, look both ways
before you cross the street.

26:42.154 --> 26:43.953
Don't talk to strangers.

26:43.955 --> 26:46.323
Turn off all appliances
during a lightning storm.

26:46.325 --> 26:49.958
Mothers worry about their sons.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.762
It's just that he was always

26:52.764 --> 26:55.364
such a frail child.

26:55.366 --> 26:58.801
Did you know that Sebastian
never spoke a word

26:58.803 --> 27:00.336
until he was three years old?

27:00.338 --> 27:01.804
I didn't.

27:01.806 --> 27:03.506
Yeah. I was sure that
something was wrong,

27:03.508 --> 27:05.073
so I-I went to every specialist,

27:05.075 --> 27:08.376
and-and none of them knew
what-what it was.

27:08.378 --> 27:11.813
And then one day,

27:11.815 --> 27:15.183
this switch got turned on,

27:15.185 --> 27:17.185
and voilà!
He just could not

27:17.187 --> 27:19.921
stop talking, you know,
he's just, just...

27:20.267 --> 27:22.733
Like his mom.

27:22.735 --> 27:25.502
And I know, it's just that some
people find that annoying,

27:25.504 --> 27:27.404
but for me, I...

27:27.406 --> 27:29.840
I know, it just, uh...

27:29.842 --> 27:32.843
reminded me that he was okay.

27:36.482 --> 27:38.615
But now I
don't know, I...

27:39.885 --> 27:43.186
God, he's all alone...

27:43.188 --> 27:45.855
Sylvia.

27:47.592 --> 27:48.892
He's not alone.

27:48.894 --> 27:50.626
We're with him.

27:51.496 --> 27:53.596
Thank you.

27:53.598 --> 27:55.198
It's okay. Come on.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.765
It's all right.

27:59.003 --> 28:02.571
<i>Our two kidnappers took</i>
<i>Sebastian into Lafitte</i>

28:02.573 --> 28:03.772
prison to help break
someone out,

28:03.774 --> 28:05.174
and he doesn't want us
to save him?

28:05.176 --> 28:06.575
Says he's dead
if we make a move.

28:06.577 --> 28:08.143
We're just supposed
to stand down?

28:08.145 --> 28:09.311
It's what Sebastian wants.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.579
What I want is to know

28:10.581 --> 28:12.480
who he's supposed to break out.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.815
Let me edify you.

28:13.817 --> 28:17.051
Goran Bogdan,
aka Bogdan the Butcher.

28:17.053 --> 28:18.485
He's Serbia's public enemy
number one.

28:18.487 --> 28:19.787
International smuggler.

28:19.789 --> 28:21.655
Currently resides at Lafitte.

28:21.657 --> 28:23.191
Lot of high value inmates
at Lafitte.

28:23.193 --> 28:24.525
Why'd you land on Bogdan?

28:24.527 --> 28:26.761
I think I may have identified
our kidnappers.

28:26.763 --> 28:29.430
They belong
to Bogdan's syndicate.

28:29.432 --> 28:31.064
Natasha Divac
and Stefan Yelich.

28:31.066 --> 28:32.665
Not easy when all you have
is sketches,

28:32.667 --> 28:34.634
but BRUCE came through.

28:34.636 --> 28:36.402
He spit out these two.

28:36.404 --> 28:39.639
Both Serbian. Both wanted by
Interpol for various crimes.

28:39.641 --> 28:42.342
And both have player profiles
on the <i>Escape Proof</i> game.

28:42.344 --> 28:44.477
Yeah, they were looking
for players in that game

28:44.479 --> 28:45.912
to help break Bogdan out.

28:45.914 --> 28:47.780
And that's how
they discovered Reid

28:47.782 --> 28:50.315
and Sebastian--
the two top scorers.

28:50.317 --> 28:51.751
Right, so they're
our kidnappers.

28:51.753 --> 28:54.553
But Sebastian mentioned
somebody named Novak.

28:54.555 --> 28:56.622
Novak.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.292
Alex Novak.

29:00.294 --> 29:02.762
Immigrated from Serbia in 2006.

29:02.764 --> 29:05.429
Took a job as a prison guard
at Lafitte last year.

29:05.431 --> 29:08.332
That's around the time
Bogdan arrived.

29:08.334 --> 29:10.468
Record's clean,
but he's got syndicate ties.

29:10.470 --> 29:12.036
Perfect plant to help
their boss get out.

29:12.038 --> 29:14.639
Which, obviously,
we can't let happen.

29:14.641 --> 29:17.108
Which is exactly what we got
to let happen.

29:17.110 --> 29:19.177
Sorry?
We stop the breakout...

29:19.179 --> 29:21.679
they'll kill Sebastian.
All due respect,

29:21.681 --> 29:23.280
even if we don't stop
the breakout,

29:23.282 --> 29:24.815
they'll probably kill Sebastian.

29:24.817 --> 29:27.517
Listen, we got to call
the warden and shut this down.

29:27.519 --> 29:32.455
I realize this goes against
every FBI protocol you got.

29:32.457 --> 29:35.558
No need to involve you
any further, let's go.

29:38.430 --> 29:40.863
Hey.

29:40.865 --> 29:44.200
I think I've proven that I don't
really care about protocol,

29:44.202 --> 29:45.601
but this is about common sense.

29:45.603 --> 29:47.736
There's a chance this Bogdan
might actually get away.

29:47.738 --> 29:49.438
Not gonna let that happen.

29:49.440 --> 29:52.241
Bogdan makes it out of the
prison, that's a good thing.

29:52.243 --> 29:55.111
We take him down
and save Sebastian.

29:55.113 --> 29:57.512
You don't even know when the
breakout's supposed to happen.

29:57.514 --> 29:59.580
When Sebastian called Pride's
phone from the prison,

29:59.582 --> 30:01.316
he left a digital footprint.

30:01.318 --> 30:02.884
I might be able
to back trace it.

30:02.886 --> 30:04.820
Which means maybe we can
keep tabs on Sebastian.

30:04.822 --> 30:06.855
Do you hear yourselves?
“Might be, maybe.”

30:06.857 --> 30:08.389
There's not a lot to go on.

30:08.391 --> 30:09.590
Look, we have
Sebastian, too.

30:09.592 --> 30:11.626
All right?
He said he had a plan.

30:11.628 --> 30:13.694
Who? Your lab tech who's afraid
of his own shadow?

30:13.696 --> 30:15.529
What's he gonna do?

30:15.531 --> 30:16.864
You don't know Sebastian
like we do.

30:16.866 --> 30:18.598
Please.
This is insanity.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.235
Look, we get it, you're not
on board with the plan.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.303
That's fine.

30:22.305 --> 30:23.370
We are, so excuse us.

30:23.372 --> 30:25.505
No, excuse me.

30:25.507 --> 30:27.607
Did I say I'm not on board
with the plan?

30:27.609 --> 30:29.409
I've worked with you guys
enough times to know

30:29.411 --> 30:32.645
that when you got a plan, it's
worth considering, but this?

30:32.647 --> 30:34.513
This is crazy.

30:34.515 --> 30:38.084
But see, it just doesn't matter
when you got skin in the game.

30:40.722 --> 30:43.223
All right.

30:43.225 --> 30:45.758
Let's go find the little guy.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.826
Patton.

30:47.828 --> 30:49.261
Let us know when you
got a bead on Sebastian.

30:49.263 --> 30:51.730
We are going to Lafitte.

30:52.858 --> 30:55.626
Why am I already
regretting this?

30:56.594 --> 30:58.860
<i>Can you get on the prison's</i>
<i>network or not?</i>

30:58.862 --> 31:00.529
Well, it's-it's
not just one network.

31:00.531 --> 31:02.030
it's a series of subnetworks,
and each one controls

31:02.032 --> 31:02.925
a different part
of the facility.

31:02.926 --> 31:03.567
Hack them all.

31:03.591 --> 31:05.521
It doesn't...
it doesn't work like that.

31:08.063 --> 31:10.531
Don't forget what's
at stake here for you.

31:10.533 --> 31:12.533
It's all
I'm thinking about.

31:12.535 --> 31:15.902
Well, that and a-a work-around
to access the whole network.

31:18.974 --> 31:22.675
See, if-if the emergency system
gets activated,

31:22.677 --> 31:25.177
then all the subnetworks filter
into one master network.

31:25.179 --> 31:27.213
Then I've got control
of every camera,

31:27.215 --> 31:29.048
sensor and door in the prison.

31:29.050 --> 31:31.117
What do you need to get it done?

31:31.953 --> 31:34.754
An emergency.

31:38.525 --> 31:40.859
I found the computer tablet
that Sebastian is using.

31:40.861 --> 31:43.228
He's trying to hack into
the security network,

31:43.230 --> 31:45.196
and he's not covering his tracks
at all.

31:45.198 --> 31:47.065
Well, he's got to be nervous,
with so much at stake.

31:47.067 --> 31:49.601
Sure, he's nervous,
but he's never sloppy.

31:49.603 --> 31:50.835
He's doing that
so I can find him.

31:50.837 --> 31:51.870
Yeah, like bread crumbs.

31:51.872 --> 31:53.238
He knew we'd be looking.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.205
You got to love the guy.

31:54.207 --> 31:55.206
Let's love him later.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.707
Any idea where

31:56.709 --> 31:58.509
he's coming out of the prison?
Not yet.

31:58.511 --> 32:00.745
But he's trying to access
the emergency security system.

32:00.747 --> 32:02.480
Only used when the prison
is on lockdown.

32:02.482 --> 32:05.115
You let us know
the second you know more.

32:05.117 --> 32:08.986
Sebastian, talk to me, man.

32:21.065 --> 32:23.733
Attention, all blocks. Lockdown.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.101
Lockdown. Lockdown.

32:25.103 --> 32:26.903
Y'all are on mandatory lockdown.

32:26.905 --> 32:30.038
Return to your cells!
All inmates return to your...

32:34.278 --> 32:37.112
Come on, Patton.
Figure this out.

32:37.114 --> 32:39.715
There's your emergency.
We're on lockdown.

32:39.717 --> 32:41.650
You access the network?

32:41.652 --> 32:43.852
I'm in. Yeah.
I got full control of security.

32:43.854 --> 32:45.788
Doors, cameras, everything.
What's our exit route?

32:45.790 --> 32:47.822
Drainage pipe in the back of the
building. I'll clear the way.

32:47.824 --> 32:49.890
Come on,
let's go get your guy.

32:51.528 --> 32:54.495
Cameras still look active.

32:54.497 --> 32:56.631
Yeah, they're on,
but the signal's been disrupted.

32:56.633 --> 32:57.632
We're good.

32:57.634 --> 33:00.601
Unlock the door.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.040
Come on out,
Mr. Bogdan.

33:07.876 --> 33:09.075
Wait. Bogdan?

33:09.077 --> 33:10.844
You mean
like Bogdan the Butcher?

33:12.180 --> 33:14.280
Took long enough, Novak.
We got to go.

33:14.282 --> 33:16.683
He's, like, a really bad person.

33:16.685 --> 33:18.885
Now, Sebastian.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.222
Yes! I knew my man had a plan.

33:23.224 --> 33:25.524
Pride, we got movement.
I'm tracking the signal

33:25.526 --> 33:27.693
on the computer. I know where
Sebastian's gonna come out.

33:27.695 --> 33:30.062
He's in a drain pipe.
He's coming out about 100 yards

33:30.064 --> 33:31.764
behind the prison.

33:31.766 --> 33:33.566
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>fire started in the prison</i>

33:33.568 --> 33:35.234
ten minutes ago.
They're in full lockdown.

33:35.236 --> 33:37.336
King.

33:41.842 --> 33:44.509
It's our suspects.
Right on time.

33:44.511 --> 33:46.511
I'll call for backup.
No, no, no.

33:46.513 --> 33:49.080
Plan is get eyes
on Sebastian first.

33:56.522 --> 33:58.822
This is disgusting, Novak.

33:58.824 --> 34:01.759
Keep moving, Mr. Bogdan.

34:03.496 --> 34:05.529
Oh, we got a problem.
What?

34:05.531 --> 34:07.631
Prison security patrol.

34:07.633 --> 34:09.099
Don't think they're
hip to the plan.

34:09.101 --> 34:12.368
Turn off your engine
and step out of the vehicle.

34:14.505 --> 34:17.039
Turn off your engine
and step out of the vehicle.

34:25.516 --> 34:27.583
Oh, this isn't
gonna go well.

34:27.585 --> 34:30.284
Damn it. Hang on.

34:40.931 --> 34:41.830
You said this was safe!

34:41.831 --> 34:43.297
It was! Let's go!

34:43.300 --> 34:45.766
Forget about him!

34:45.768 --> 34:48.902
Come on, hurry! Move!

34:48.905 --> 34:50.370
Let's go!

35:04.118 --> 35:05.852
This is a bad idea.

35:11.493 --> 35:12.792
Sebastian!

35:20.835 --> 35:22.434
Weren't we supposed to save him?

35:36.352 --> 35:38.119
<i>Yeah, we need backup</i>

35:38.121 --> 35:39.987
at Lafitte Federal.
We're tracking a gold

35:39.989 --> 35:42.055
dually pickup truck
heading west.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.689
Hope you have something, P,

35:43.691 --> 35:45.792
'cause we don't have a visual
on the truck.

35:45.794 --> 35:47.093
Got the whole kit and caboodle.

35:47.095 --> 35:48.728
Get ready to turn
on the service road

35:48.730 --> 35:50.063
on the right.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.697
Tell me you're not guessing.

35:51.699 --> 35:53.699
I'm not doing anything.
This is all Sebastian.

35:53.701 --> 35:56.002
I'm still tracking the signal
on the computer.

35:56.004 --> 35:58.538
Man had a good damn reason
for getting in that truck.

35:58.540 --> 35:59.585
That's some straight hero ball.

35:59.609 --> 36:00.740
Could've just thrown
the tablet

36:00.741 --> 36:02.507
in the pickup and saved himself.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.643
Just saying.

36:09.650 --> 36:11.750
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.953
I'm screwed.

36:15.222 --> 36:18.323
Oh, we got a situation, man.

36:18.325 --> 36:19.924
I lost the signal.

36:19.926 --> 36:22.160
I'm at a fork in the road.
Which way, Patton?

36:22.162 --> 36:26.530
I don't know.
Sebastian's signal is dead.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.967
We got every cop in the state
heading this way.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.435
Well, it won't help if we
don't know where they're going.

36:30.437 --> 36:33.003
Bogdan just busted out
of federal prison.

36:33.005 --> 36:37.374
Got to have an exit plan
to get out of the country.

36:37.376 --> 36:39.581
Well, the closest air strip
from here is 40 miles.

36:39.605 --> 36:40.578
They're not gonna take a plane.

36:40.579 --> 36:42.446
It's the bayou.
Dozens of boat slips.

36:42.448 --> 36:45.482
Any number of ways to sneak into
the gulf and then open ocean.

36:45.484 --> 36:48.018
That doesn't really narrow down
our search.

36:48.020 --> 36:50.219
Where are you, Sebastian?

36:52.390 --> 36:54.991
You make a mess of this, Novak.

36:54.993 --> 36:56.359
You're out, aren't you?

36:56.361 --> 36:58.127
“Thank you” would be nice.

36:58.129 --> 37:00.162
Just give me the damn clothes.

37:00.164 --> 37:02.164
And take me to the boat.

37:26.255 --> 37:27.954
It's a really bad idea.

37:33.795 --> 37:36.830
Common household items.

37:57.585 --> 38:00.519
I think we found
Sebastian.

38:04.425 --> 38:06.258
I'll get him!
He'll call the police!

38:06.260 --> 38:09.361
I got it! Get Bogdan on the
boat! Don't leave without me!

38:11.965 --> 38:13.498
Let's go.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.170
NCIS!

38:19.172 --> 38:20.204
Put the weapon
down!

38:25.078 --> 38:27.545
Novak and Sebastian--
I don't see 'em.

38:27.547 --> 38:28.645
Where are they?!

38:28.647 --> 38:30.914
What's in it for me
if I tell you?

38:30.916 --> 38:32.482
We don't kneecap you,
for starts.

38:33.718 --> 38:35.185
Doesn't matter anyway.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.187
You're too late.

39:01.044 --> 39:03.912
Sebastian, get away...

39:18.495 --> 39:20.661
Hey.

39:21.498 --> 39:24.030
It's over.

39:32.674 --> 39:35.175
I got you, okay?

39:35.177 --> 39:36.343
Did I...?

39:36.345 --> 39:39.012
Did I, uh...?
Yeah.

39:39.014 --> 39:40.346
You did good.

39:42.250 --> 39:45.717
Okay. All right.

39:47.522 --> 39:50.756
All right.

39:50.758 --> 39:52.391
You can let go now, Sebastian.

39:52.393 --> 39:55.294
Uh-uh.

40:00.767 --> 40:03.000
Hail to the conquering hero!

40:03.002 --> 40:04.602
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!

40:04.604 --> 40:06.204
Man, why you want
to worry us like that?

40:06.206 --> 40:08.072
Getting all emotional.

40:08.074 --> 40:10.675
Guys, I... I-I don't know
what to say.

40:10.677 --> 40:12.477
I mean, if it weren't for you...
Really?

40:12.479 --> 40:13.645
You're trying to give us credit?

40:13.647 --> 40:15.212
Yeah. Drop the humility angle.

40:15.214 --> 40:16.446
You were the badass
out there today.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.348
“Badass”?
Yes.

40:18.350 --> 40:21.552
I like how that sounds.
Don't let it go to your head.

40:21.554 --> 40:23.953
I mean, technically, I guess I-I
did orchestrate a prison break.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.656
- Mmm.
- Badass in my book. Right,

40:25.658 --> 40:27.457
and I blew up
a truck. Oh, and

40:27.459 --> 40:29.025
I knocked out
this super scary dude

40:29.027 --> 40:30.420
who had a super
scary gun.

40:30.444 --> 40:30.995
No.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.010
Yes.

40:32.034 --> 40:34.058
Oh, Lord, we done created
a monster.
