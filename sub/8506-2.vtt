00:00.902 --> 00:04.769
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

00:04.770 --> 00:07.172
<i>conquered the world and
murdered my wife and child.</i>

00:07.173 --> 00:10.008
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

00:10.009 --> 00:11.675
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

00:11.677 --> 00:13.578
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

00:13.579 --> 00:15.846
<i>by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to:</i>

00:15.848 --> 00:17.348
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.284
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

00:19.285 --> 00:21.453
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

00:21.454 --> 00:24.922
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

00:26.592 --> 00:28.560
<i>Previously, on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:28.561 --> 00:30.862
Savage has kept his movements
hidden throughout history,

00:30.863 --> 00:34.031
but professor Aldus Boardman
is the world's leading expert.

00:34.033 --> 00:36.868
- Savage was an Egyptian priest.
- Kendra and I reincarnate.

00:36.869 --> 00:39.070
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

00:39.071 --> 00:41.673
That's what maintains
his immortality.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.207
<i>Professor Boardman
has sustained</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:44.542
<i>severe internal injuries.</i>

00:44.543 --> 00:46.111
100 years from now,
your lives

00:46.112 --> 00:48.046
have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.581
You lied to us.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.215
I don't give a damn
about being a legend

00:51.217 --> 00:53.450
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

00:53.452 --> 00:55.853
So how do we find this guy?

01:01.649 --> 01:03.294
And we've arrived.

01:03.295 --> 01:05.129
Gideon, if you wouldn't mind
camouflaging us

01:05.131 --> 01:06.765
as an alpine meadow, perhaps?

01:06.766 --> 01:08.233
What are you
complaining about now?

01:08.234 --> 01:09.434
It's not like we time-jumped.

01:09.435 --> 01:11.703
I hate flying,
especially in...

01:11.704 --> 01:13.438
whatever this thing is.

01:13.439 --> 01:14.939
Where exactly are we?

01:14.940 --> 01:17.409
- We're still in 1975, right?
- Indeed.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.278
October 1975 on the fjords
of northern Norway.

01:20.279 --> 01:21.979
Sounds like a vacation.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.915
Which we can take
as soon as the threat of Savage

01:23.916 --> 01:25.449
has been neutralized, Mr. Snart.

01:25.451 --> 01:26.718
That's Aldus's notebook.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.687
Now he theorized
that Savage might

01:28.688 --> 01:30.121
be here, and if he's right,

01:30.122 --> 01:31.790
and if we can capture Savage,
then at least

01:31.791 --> 01:33.792
Professor Boardman didn't
die in vain.

01:33.793 --> 01:36.394
Can't we just go back
and save Aldus?

01:36.395 --> 01:37.728
He was our son.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.597
Look, I'm sorry.

01:39.598 --> 01:41.933
We can't go back and change
events in which we participated.

01:41.934 --> 01:44.502
Time would fold in on itself,
creating a temporal vortex.

01:44.503 --> 01:46.004
Which sounds way cooler
than it is.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.039
Forgetting physics
for a second,

01:48.040 --> 01:50.775
shouldn't we figure out
what Savage is doing in Norway?

01:50.776 --> 01:52.644
According to Gideon,
there is a large meeting

01:52.645 --> 01:55.380
of terrorists and fringe groups
looking to buy illegal arms.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.515
Now that sounds
like a vacation.

01:57.516 --> 01:58.950
Arms dealers and terrorists

01:58.951 --> 02:01.019
aren't exactly
our kind of people,

02:01.020 --> 02:02.954
but they're the next best thing.

02:02.955 --> 02:04.489
Well, looks like you
and your lapdog

02:04.490 --> 02:05.857
get to earn your keep.

02:05.858 --> 02:08.092
I'm no one's lapdog,
bird-man.

02:08.094 --> 02:10.027
So what exactly does one wear

02:10.029 --> 02:11.763
to a black market arms bazaar,
anyway?

02:11.764 --> 02:13.364
The Waverider has
a fabrication room

02:13.365 --> 02:15.233
which can fashion
temporally-indigenous,

02:15.234 --> 02:16.968
uh, fashion.

02:16.969 --> 02:19.070
You've got a room
that makes clothing?

02:19.071 --> 02:21.039
Doesn't everyone?

02:21.040 --> 02:22.507
All right, first thing
we need to do

02:22.508 --> 02:23.708
is work up a plan.

02:23.709 --> 02:24.943
Got a lot of experience

02:24.944 --> 02:26.745
infiltrating criminal
gatherings?

02:26.746 --> 02:28.613
Didn't think so.
I'm calling the shots.

02:28.614 --> 02:29.814
Actually, I'm in charge,

02:29.815 --> 02:31.182
in case any of you
have forgotten.

02:31.183 --> 02:33.585
No, I remember.
I just don't care.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.553
Do I need to remind any of you
that I'm a Time Master?

02:35.554 --> 02:37.422
Making discrete alterations
to the timeline

02:37.423 --> 02:39.724

just gonna charge into the past

10:56.455 --> 10:57.955
Come again?

10:57.956 --> 10:59.757
Armed with Dr. Palmer's
future technology,

10:59.758 --> 11:01.325
Savage's engineers
develop a weapon

11:01.326 --> 11:03.394
far more destructive than
anything here in 1975.

11:03.395 --> 11:05.997
This is Central City in 2016.
At least it was.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.765
I'm not sure what
the neo-fascists

11:07.766 --> 11:10.901
who took control of it
are calling it these days.

11:14.873 --> 11:17.575
There must be a way
to correct this somehow.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.710
Fortunately, Gideon is just
showing us a forecast

11:19.711 --> 11:21.746
of the future
you've all created.

11:21.747 --> 11:22.980
Time is like cement.

11:22.981 --> 11:25.983
It takes time
to become permanent.

11:25.984 --> 11:27.717
In this case,
until Savage's team

11:27.719 --> 11:29.954
have worked out the mystery
of your future technology

11:29.955 --> 11:33.257
and molded it to their own ends.

11:33.258 --> 11:35.559
And when they do,

11:35.560 --> 11:37.762
what you see here is
no longer just a forecast.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.864
This...

11:41.933 --> 11:43.645
This is history.

12:00.131 --> 12:01.480
Where is he?

12:01.934 --> 12:04.687
His body, I mean.

12:04.688 --> 12:07.795
There's cryo-storage
in the MedBay.

12:09.132 --> 12:10.866
I promise we'll get our son
a proper burial

12:10.867 --> 12:12.151
once we have a chance.

12:12.152 --> 12:15.503
It's still so weird
to hear you call him that.

12:16.506 --> 12:19.807
But even though
it was in a past life,

12:19.809 --> 12:22.144
it feels like
something's missing.

12:22.145 --> 12:24.346
I know.

12:24.347 --> 12:26.714
What's that?

12:27.784 --> 12:29.985
I found it in his pocket.

12:29.986 --> 12:33.454
I've seen this knife before.

12:36.159 --> 12:38.660
This is the knife
that Savage used to kill us.

12:38.661 --> 12:41.730
In our first life.

12:41.731 --> 12:44.533
So thanks to Raymond leaving
a piece of his suit in the past,

12:44.534 --> 12:47.736
the rest of us don't have
a future to go back to?

12:47.737 --> 12:50.772
Unless we do something to
change this course of events,

12:50.773 --> 12:53.241
the future will
become immutable.

12:53.242 --> 12:55.076
Exactly how much time
do we have?

12:55.077 --> 12:58.246
Until Savage's weapons team
reverse-engineer your tech.

12:58.247 --> 13:00.347
We're talking 1970s terrorists

13:00.349 --> 13:01.917
with 21st-century weapons.

13:01.918 --> 13:03.751
And since we don't know
where Savage went...

13:03.753 --> 13:05.821
We don't have to find Savage.

13:05.822 --> 13:08.056
We just have to find
the other piece of my suit.

13:08.057 --> 13:09.758
Which shrinks because
it's made of an alloy

13:09.759 --> 13:12.060
which mimics intra-molecular
compression of dwarf star,

13:12.061 --> 13:13.461
thus emitting Alpha Particles.

13:13.462 --> 13:15.697
So we just need
to be able to track them.

13:15.698 --> 13:18.066
Fortunately, Alpha Particles
are highly trackable.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.868
Yet unheard of in the 1970s.

13:19.869 --> 13:21.703
It's like we're trapped
in the Stone Age.

13:21.704 --> 13:24.039
I'll have you know that I was
researching Alpha Particles

13:24.040 --> 13:25.674
when you were eating crayons.

13:25.675 --> 13:28.210
So to track that piece of
Raymond's super-suit,

13:28.211 --> 13:30.044
we just need to talk to...

13:30.046 --> 13:31.213
Me.

13:31.214 --> 13:33.281
25-year-old me, rather.

13:33.282 --> 13:34.783
You two are just in time.

13:34.784 --> 13:36.351
Show them, Kendra.

13:36.352 --> 13:38.320
Aldus was carrying this
when he was killed.

13:38.321 --> 13:40.789
It's a newspaper article about
an Egyptian dagger.

13:40.790 --> 13:42.489
The one Savage used
to kill us.

13:42.491 --> 13:44.626
In Central City, we learned
that objects associated

13:44.627 --> 13:47.329
with the night of our deaths
can also be used to kill Savage.

13:47.330 --> 13:49.664
According to Aldus's notes,
the dagger needs to be wielded

13:49.665 --> 13:52.267
in conjunction with
an incantation inscribed on it.

13:52.268 --> 13:55.303
What does
this incantation say?

13:55.304 --> 13:58.240
I don't know.
I can't read the language.

13:58.241 --> 14:00.208
It's okay.
I'll help you remember.

14:00.209 --> 14:02.510
Splendid.
Now, as for the dagger...

14:02.511 --> 14:04.179
- You need someone to steal it.
- Okay, fine.

14:04.180 --> 14:06.615
Whatever.
I'll do it.

14:06.616 --> 14:09.150
Article says it was purchased by
some rich Russian douche bag

14:09.151 --> 14:11.653
named Sasha Mahnovski.

14:11.654 --> 14:13.421
- I'll go with you.
- I already got a partner.

14:13.422 --> 14:14.922
Who I trust
even less than you.

14:14.924 --> 14:16.725
Look, you're more than welcome
to go with them.

14:16.726 --> 14:20.060
Just don't take along
any of your future tech.

14:21.297 --> 14:23.198
Oy!
Where do you think you're going?

14:23.199 --> 14:24.799
To break into my old lab
and bring us back

14:24.800 --> 14:25.867
the particle tracker.

14:25.868 --> 14:27.168
Fine, but perhaps,

14:27.169 --> 14:29.004
you should take Jefferson
and Sara with you

14:29.005 --> 14:30.839
to act as your intermediaries.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.074
Look, interacting with yourself
in the past

14:33.075 --> 14:36.044
can have catastrophic effects
upon the future.

14:36.045 --> 14:38.213
Fascinating.
Let's go.

it is imperative that we don't

15:29.498 --> 15:30.832
No. No.

15:30.833 --> 15:34.202

15:39.909 --> 15:42.410

15:42.411 --> 15:45.180
Uh, that's
a very interesting question.

15:45.181 --> 15:47.015
Um, suffice it to say,

15:47.016 --> 15:49.017
I am familiar with your work.

15:49.018 --> 15:50.418
That's actually
why we're here.

15:50.419 --> 15:51.820

15:51.821 --> 15:54.389

15:54.390 --> 15:57.759
No, I'm <i>the</i> leading expert.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.728
Well, we were hoping
to pick your brain

15:59.729 --> 16:01.762
about your area of expertise.

16:01.764 --> 16:02.897
- Physics?
- Mm-hmm.

16:02.898 --> 16:04.065
Which are you interested in,

16:04.066 --> 16:05.667
applied or theoretical?

16:05.668 --> 16:07.569
That is just the thing.

16:07.570 --> 16:10.238
I can't decide.

16:10.239 --> 16:12.741
I love them both.

16:12.742 --> 16:14.509
Cool.

16:14.510 --> 16:16.044
Well, let's go spark a doobie

16:16.045 --> 16:19.214

16:26.255 --> 16:30.792
Uh, are you sure
that's actually you?

16:30.793 --> 16:33.195
Oh, man.

16:34.630 --> 16:35.930

16:35.931 --> 16:37.832
You know how to
read the inscription.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.267
At least, you used to know.

16:39.268 --> 16:41.469

21:12.064 --> 21:13.498
Look, what's the big deal?

21:13.499 --> 21:15.066
I mean, younger you
isn't married yet,

21:15.067 --> 21:18.804
so technically
it's not cheating.

21:18.805 --> 21:21.540
October 1975.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.676
This is right when I meet
my future wife, Clarissa.

21:24.677 --> 21:27.679
So obviously, we wouldn't want
my former self

21:27.680 --> 21:30.615
tempted by a sexy assassin
from the future.

21:30.616 --> 21:33.084
Aw, you think I'm sex...

21:33.085 --> 21:36.054
Do not finish that sentence.

21:39.892 --> 21:41.726
Found it.

21:41.727 --> 21:43.795
<i>♪
♪</i>

21:43.796 --> 21:47.299
Is there a trick
to opening the case?

21:47.300 --> 21:53.390
<i>♪
♪</i>

21:54.340 --> 21:56.274
- Ah.
- What are you doing?

21:56.275 --> 21:57.742
Let's grab the dagger
and let's go.

21:57.743 --> 21:59.611
Raymond, you don't
break into a candy store

21:59.612 --> 22:01.346
and steal one gumball.

22:01.347 --> 22:03.915
You guys grab the goodies.

22:03.916 --> 22:06.885
I'll find the safe.

22:06.886 --> 22:08.253
What do you think
you're doing?

22:08.254 --> 22:09.754
This is what we came here for.

22:09.755 --> 22:13.358
No, it's what you
came here for.

22:13.359 --> 22:15.060
Take your hand off me.

22:15.061 --> 22:17.162
I'm not gonna let you
jeopardize another mission.

22:17.163 --> 22:20.197
I'm done asking politely.

22:20.199 --> 22:21.867
This is my mission.

22:21.868 --> 22:23.235
And I'm gonna listen to a guy

22:23.236 --> 22:25.302
who's spent half of his life
in prison?

22:25.304 --> 22:28.139
Oh!

22:31.310 --> 22:32.410
Great.

22:32.411 --> 22:35.546
Now we're both going to prison.

22:39.151 --> 22:40.652
Eureka.

22:40.653 --> 22:42.220
I remember building this.

22:42.221 --> 22:45.357
It's... it's like déjà vu
all over again.

22:45.358 --> 22:47.659
Put that down.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.728
Excellent job
watching the door.

22:49.729 --> 22:51.162
What are you doing?

22:51.163 --> 22:52.564
Oh, just, uh...

22:52.565 --> 22:54.065
what is this?

22:54.066 --> 22:56.601
Something you shouldn't be
fooling around with.

22:56.602 --> 22:59.004
It's very interesting-looking.

22:59.005 --> 23:00.939
How about you cut the crap?

23:00.940 --> 23:02.573
To which crap
are you referring?

23:02.575 --> 23:06.444
I hold two PhDs,
and I'm working on a third.

23:06.445 --> 23:10.515
I'm a five-time winner
of the Carlin Award.

23:10.516 --> 23:12.851
My point being,
is I don't believe

23:12.852 --> 23:14.686
either of those kids
you're hanging around with

23:14.687 --> 23:16.321
can even spell "physics."

23:16.322 --> 23:18.322
You know, I'm beginning
to like the younger gray

23:18.324 --> 23:19.723
less and less.

23:19.725 --> 23:22.460
Either you tell me
what the hell is going on,

23:22.461 --> 23:23.862
or I'm calling campus police.

23:23.863 --> 23:25.764
I'm not supposed to tell you.

23:25.765 --> 23:28.465
It could cause... well, trouble.

23:28.467 --> 23:31.136
We're here to interview you
for a profile

23:31.137 --> 23:34.139
in next month's "Wells Journal""

23:34.140 --> 23:37.309
The "Wells" only profiles
Nobel candidates.

23:37.310 --> 23:39.144
An exception is being made

23:39.145 --> 23:41.680
in light of
your obvious brilliance.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.682
I know a photograph of this
device would make

23:43.683 --> 23:47.152
a spectacular cover if we could
just borrow it for a few hours.

23:47.153 --> 23:49.087
Thanks, but that's

23:49.088 --> 23:51.957
two years of my life.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.825
I'm not letting you
walk away with it.

23:53.826 --> 23:55.926
Stay back!

23:58.130 --> 24:00.632
That was taking too long.

24:00.633 --> 24:02.934
You just knocked me out.

24:02.935 --> 24:05.937
That beautiful brain,
struck unconscious.

24:05.938 --> 24:09.407
The only way to shut you up.

24:09.408 --> 24:10.842
What are you doing?
We have to go.

24:10.843 --> 24:12.210
I have to make sure
I wake up in time

24:12.211 --> 24:14.312
to go to this
faculty mixer tonight.

24:14.313 --> 24:17.382
One of the professors
is bringing his niece,

24:17.383 --> 24:19.818
AKA my future wife.

24:19.819 --> 24:22.019
Let's go!

24:28.717 --> 24:30.418
What the hell happened?

24:30.419 --> 24:32.453
- It was this idiot's fault.
- Your partner's fault.

24:32.455 --> 24:34.189
I told you we shouldn't
have brought him.

24:34.190 --> 24:35.623
Agreed, but we got
bigger problems.

24:35.624 --> 24:37.025
I need you to find
the fuse box and...

24:37.026 --> 24:39.727
Trigger a system default.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.563
This ain't over.

24:49.872 --> 24:51.506
How did you know
how to do that?

24:51.507 --> 24:54.109
When I was a kid, my dad
brought me along on jobs.

24:54.110 --> 24:55.276
I had little hands.

24:55.277 --> 24:56.911
I could get into tiny spaces,

24:56.912 --> 24:58.279
do whatever he needed me to do,

24:58.280 --> 25:02.350
like... rewiring
a security system.

25:02.351 --> 25:04.752
In another life, you could've
been an electrical engineer.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.655
Guess I dodged a bullet.

25:07.656 --> 25:10.258
You think I want to be like you?

25:10.259 --> 25:11.659
You make being
a tech billionaire

25:11.660 --> 25:13.328
sound like a bad thing.

25:13.329 --> 25:15.997
You spend all your time and
money inventing a super-suit,

25:15.998 --> 25:17.631
and what do you do with it?

25:17.633 --> 25:20.268
Fly around like some incredible
shrinking schmuck

25:20.269 --> 25:23.004
trying to save the world.

25:23.005 --> 25:25.773
Robbing banks for a living... I
suppose that's more important?

25:25.774 --> 25:27.876
It's sure as hell
more satisfying.

25:27.877 --> 25:29.944
Thinking like that is what
makes you a criminal.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.012
No, it makes me a survivor.

25:32.014 --> 25:33.414
And there's gonna come a day

25:33.415 --> 25:37.030
when you wish you were too.

25:39.989 --> 25:41.788
Here.

25:44.426 --> 25:46.427
You flip the solenoid,

25:46.428 --> 25:49.397
saves you the trouble
of rewiring it.

25:49.398 --> 25:51.599
I take it back, Raymond.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.602
You're not completely useless
after all.

26:02.545 --> 26:04.077
I wanted to apologize.

26:04.079 --> 26:06.247
I'm not afraid of my past.

26:06.248 --> 26:07.649
I'm just

26:07.650 --> 26:10.552
unwilling to believe that
you're my future.

26:10.553 --> 26:11.786
And the more you keep repeating

26:11.787 --> 26:13.955
that we're destined
to be together,

26:13.956 --> 26:16.191
the more I want
to prove you wrong.

26:16.192 --> 26:17.825
And maybe that makes me
childish, and I'm...

26:17.826 --> 26:20.962
No.
It doesn't.

26:20.963 --> 26:23.398
Not at all.

26:23.399 --> 26:26.768
Look, 4,000 years
is a long time,

26:26.769 --> 26:28.603
and maybe I've been
taking us for granted,

26:28.604 --> 26:30.572
expecting you
to fall in love with me

26:30.573 --> 26:33.341
because that's what you've done
the last 206 lifetimes,

26:33.342 --> 26:35.677
but you're right.

26:35.678 --> 26:38.413
Does not make us destiny.

26:38.414 --> 26:42.049
More like... probability.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.753
Look, Kendra.

26:45.754 --> 26:48.957
You don't have to love me
in this lifetime.

26:48.958 --> 26:51.893
As many lifetimes as it takes.

26:51.894 --> 26:54.861
I know you're worth the wait.

26:56.232 --> 26:57.732
All right, well, uh,

26:57.733 --> 27:00.367
let's try this again.

27:02.104 --> 27:05.406
You know what to do.

27:06.575 --> 27:09.443
Your name is Chay-Ara,

27:09.445 --> 27:13.080
and you're a priestess
in the temple of Horus.

27:16.619 --> 27:20.421
You're giving me a knife...
as a present?

27:20.422 --> 27:21.689
Your conceptions of romance

27:21.690 --> 27:23.924
require some adjustment,
I think.

27:23.926 --> 27:25.260
It's sacred.

27:25.261 --> 27:26.761
I was told that
only a high priestess

27:26.762 --> 27:28.195
could read the inscription.

27:28.197 --> 27:30.331
- It's a...
- A poem.

27:30.332 --> 27:32.700
"And though my soul
departs the Earth,

27:32.701 --> 27:35.103
"I count my days
till my rebirth.

27:35.104 --> 27:37.872
"I will wait across eternity

27:37.873 --> 27:41.642
for my love to come back to me""

<i>♪

27:53.088 --> 27:54.455
The knife.

27:54.456 --> 27:55.757
You gave it to me,

27:55.758 --> 27:57.325
and the inscription,

27:57.326 --> 27:58.960
it was a poem... a love poem

27:58.961 --> 28:00.662
which promises...

28:00.663 --> 28:02.530
Promises what?

28:02.531 --> 28:06.433
That we'd be together forever.

28:09.038 --> 28:10.905
Perhaps I really am a genius.

28:10.906 --> 28:14.342
My younger self's tracker led us
straight to Savage's lab.

28:14.343 --> 28:17.812
Reading's at 96.6%
It's definitely down there.

28:17.813 --> 28:20.281
- Be right back.
- Whoa... wait, wait, wait.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.582
Shouldn't we handle this?

28:21.583 --> 28:23.551
I mean, you're pretty stoned.

28:23.552 --> 28:25.286
I could be unconscious
and still be able

28:25.287 --> 28:28.890
to kick the ass of a few
rent-a-thugs from 1975.

28:28.891 --> 28:31.326

28:38.467 --> 28:42.437

28:43.572 --> 28:44.839
Yeah.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.307
And y'all have
a lovely evening.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.578
Huh.

28:50.579 --> 28:52.213
Looks like Rory found
the fuse box.

28:52.214 --> 28:53.748
We got a slight problem.

28:53.749 --> 28:55.249
The owner just came home.

28:55.250 --> 28:58.086
You're not gonna believe
who it is.

28:58.087 --> 29:00.355
We meet again.

29:00.356 --> 29:03.291
Oh, I'm grateful
for another opportunity

29:03.292 --> 29:05.892
to kill you.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.766
I've never
saved the world before.

29:11.767 --> 29:13.501
Feels good.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.337
We should've picked up some
donuts on the way back.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.772
Oh, my God.

29:17.773 --> 29:19.307
My ring.

29:19.308 --> 29:21.309
When you knocked me out,
I must not have woken up,

29:21.310 --> 29:24.112
or did, and decided not
to go to the mixer.

29:24.113 --> 29:25.680
Clarissa.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.315
Holy crap.

29:27.316 --> 29:29.917
Now, do you want to tell me
who you are

29:29.918 --> 29:33.320
and where you're from?

29:39.782 --> 29:41.549
Stop struggling.

29:41.550 --> 29:43.917
I've had 4,000 years of training

29:43.919 --> 29:47.321
in every hold and
pressure point known.

29:47.322 --> 29:49.956
But you already know that,
don't you?

29:49.958 --> 29:51.693
That I'm immortal.

29:51.694 --> 29:53.628
I'm gonna kill you anyway.

29:53.629 --> 29:54.996
That's a promise.

29:54.997 --> 29:57.965
Oh, what have I done
to deserve such enmity?

29:57.966 --> 29:59.801
No, let me rephrase that.

29:59.802 --> 30:02.837
What have I done to you?

30:02.838 --> 30:04.238
Perhaps you have targeted me

30:04.239 --> 30:06.641
for something I've yet to do.

30:06.642 --> 30:09.877
You traveled here from
some point in the future.

30:09.878 --> 30:11.713
Catches on fast, this guy.

30:11.714 --> 30:15.315
Visitors from another time.

30:15.317 --> 30:17.318
Oh!

30:17.319 --> 30:19.454
You won't be so happy when
the rest of the team shows up

30:19.455 --> 30:21.723
and knocks that smug grin
off your face.

30:21.724 --> 30:25.193
Oh, why wait?

30:26.762 --> 30:29.964
A communications device
of some sort,

30:29.965 --> 30:32.600
I imagine.

30:32.601 --> 30:33.868
Please.

30:33.869 --> 30:35.570
Contact your friends.

30:35.571 --> 30:37.038
I'm looking forward to seeing

30:37.039 --> 30:39.874
at least two of them again.

30:39.875 --> 30:42.510
Un-believable!

30:42.511 --> 30:44.212
Is that a tachyon manifold?

30:44.213 --> 30:45.813
Hey, how did you find us, man?

30:45.814 --> 30:47.448
You think I couldn't
build something

30:47.449 --> 30:48.850
to track my own tracker?

30:48.851 --> 30:50.551
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

30:50.552 --> 30:52.220
What I've done?

30:52.221 --> 30:54.021
You guys knocked me out.

30:54.022 --> 30:56.023
Which we wouldn't have had
to do in the first place

30:56.024 --> 30:57.792
if you weren't
such a monumental jerk!

30:57.793 --> 31:00.928
Okay, uh, can I just... yeah.

31:00.929 --> 31:03.965
Watch him, Sara.

31:03.966 --> 31:05.633
Yo, you need to calm down

31:05.634 --> 31:07.535
and you need to stop
yelling at yourself.

31:07.536 --> 31:09.704
- His arrogant curiosity...
- Yeah.

31:09.705 --> 31:12.607
He's curious and too smart
for his own good,

31:12.608 --> 31:14.442
but I'm sure you can relate.

31:14.443 --> 31:16.778
You're just pissed you didn't
see it coming sooner, and...

31:16.779 --> 31:18.379
That's not it.

31:18.380 --> 31:21.015
Although you are correct
in observing

31:21.016 --> 31:24.118
my ire is self-directed.

31:24.119 --> 31:26.087
It's a rude awakening
when one realizes

31:26.088 --> 31:28.523
that despite decades of
what one thought

31:28.524 --> 31:31.192
was maturation and experience,

31:31.193 --> 31:34.796
you haven't really
changed at all.

31:34.797 --> 31:37.331
That same arrogance I derided

31:37.332 --> 31:39.100
in my younger self

31:39.101 --> 31:41.602
was on full display
at the weapons bazaar.

31:41.603 --> 31:43.404
Over 60 years on this planet,

31:43.405 --> 31:45.039
and I have learned nothing.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.708
I think you're being a little
too hard on yourself.

31:47.709 --> 31:50.311
Which makes a nice change from
you always being hard on me,

31:50.312 --> 31:52.313
but yeah,

31:52.314 --> 31:54.315
you're arrogant.

31:54.316 --> 31:56.083
But you're also smart,

31:56.084 --> 31:57.952
and kind, and selfless.

31:57.953 --> 31:59.887
I mean, you want
to make the world a better place

31:59.888 --> 32:02.924
and you're willing to risk
everything to make that happen.

32:02.925 --> 32:04.759
That?

32:04.760 --> 32:06.894
That is not a bad guy.

32:06.895 --> 32:10.331
And neither is this one.

32:10.332 --> 32:13.100
Meeting Clarissa was one of
the great moments of my life,

32:13.101 --> 32:16.604
and meeting you was another.

32:16.605 --> 32:19.740
You are a fine young man,

32:19.741 --> 32:21.676
Mr. Jackson.

32:25.647 --> 32:28.583
Can someone please tell me

32:28.584 --> 32:30.017
You didn't say
anything to him?

32:30.018 --> 32:31.652
I figured we screwed up
the '70s enough.

32:31.653 --> 32:33.187

32:33.188 --> 32:34.721

He was just leaving.

32:45.667 --> 32:49.637
So, have we met before?

32:49.638 --> 32:52.306
In a manner of speaking.

32:52.307 --> 32:55.776
Ha... have a wonderful life,

32:55.777 --> 32:58.912

33:23.438 --> 33:24.672
Doesn't matter.
