00:10.218 --> 00:14.347
JASON USED HIS ADVANTAGE
TO TAKE OUT THE TOP.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.766
- I WANT TO TAKE DOWN THE BIG
DOGS IN THIS COMPETITION.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.600
- IT GETS A LITTLE BIT
DIFFICULT TO READ.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.270
{\an8}- SO THAT WAS INTENTIONAL.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.022
- JOSH IS JUST A BIG PUSSY.
HE HAS AN EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.441
- YOU ARE THE KING OF EXCUSES.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.609
- AND YOU'RE THE QUEEN
OF BITCHY, [bleep] TATTOOS.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.694

TO FINALLY SHUT HER UP.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.195
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO DOWN
BECAUSE YOU'RE [bleep]

00:29.279 --> 00:30.196

00:39.038 --> 00:41.958

CAUSED RIVALRIES TO EXPLODE.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.294
- I GAVE YOU RIBS,
AND YOU PUSSIED OUT OF IT.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.128
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING A PUSSY

00:45.211 --> 00:47.088
AND MAKING
A PROFESSIONAL DECISION.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.048

FOR THIS [bleep].

00:59.851 --> 01:02.312
- RYAN...
- THIS REALLY WENT BAD.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.440
- THE POOR HORSE'S FACE.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

01:05.522 --> 01:06.149
- DID THE BEST I COULD, MAN.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.984
- IF THIS IS THE BEST YOU GOT,

01:08.067 --> 01:08.985
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.905
- MARK, I DEBATED
WHETHER OR NOT THIS THING

01:11.988 --> 01:13.281
WAS WRAPPED UP IN BACON.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.324
- YOU'RE DOWN HERE A LOT,
AND IT'S GETTING HARDER

01:14.407 --> 01:17.869
AND HARDER TO JUSTIFY YOU
IN THIS COMPETITION.

01:17.952 --> 01:18.870
- EMILY...

01:18.953 --> 01:20.079
- IT LOOKS LIKE LASER REMOVAL
ON THE TOP.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.582
THIS DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE YOU WANT TO BE AROUND.

01:22.665 --> 01:26.211
- I WANT TO SHOW YOU GUYS THAT
I'M COMPLETELY CAPABLE OF THIS.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.671
- THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE GIVEN US,
AND IF YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY,

01:28.755 --> 01:30.215
PROVE IT.

01:30.298 --> 01:34.135

JUST WHAT TO GIVE US.

06:32.391 --> 06:35.269
{\an8}- CHRIS AND OLIVER, GO AHEAD
AND ASSIGN THE SKULLS, PLEASE.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.064
{\an8}- THE ONE THING I DON'T WANT
TO DO IS GIVE SOMEBODY A TATTOO

06:38.147 --> 06:39.524
{\an8}THAT I KNOW THEY CAN'T DO.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.318
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET?
- FLORAL DESIGN WITH SKULLS.

06:42.401 --> 06:45.029
- BUT I ALSO WANT TO CHALLENGE
THEM IN A WAY THAT WE CAN SEE

06:45.113 --> 06:47.448
SOMETHING MORE FROM THIS ARTIST
WE HAVEN'T SEEN SO FAR.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.116
- SOLAR SYSTEM.
- YES.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.327
MY MAN, SOLAR SYSTEM.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.247
{\an8}- A SOLAR SYSTEM COULD EASILY
TAKE 15 TO 20 HOURS PER SIDE.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.834
- BUTTERFLY.
A WING ON EACH CHEEK.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.336
- HUMANS VERSUS ALIENS.
- WHAT?

07:00.419 --> 07:02.672

ALL COLOR.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.508
{\an8}- [scoffs]

07:05.591 --> 07:08.302

{\an8}INTO THAT DARK SKIN.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.847
{\an8}IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE UNDERSTANDABLE.

07:10.930 --> 07:11.931
{\an8}IT'S NOT GOING TO BE LEGIBLE.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.432
{\an8}- BOOM.
THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.519
{\an8}WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS TRY
TO GIVE EVERYBODY REDEMPTION.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.521
{\an8}IF WE FIND AN ARTIST THAT WE'VE
SEEN A WEAKNESS IN PRIOR,

07:18.604 --> 07:21.566
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD
AND HAND THIS BACK TO THEM

07:21.649 --> 07:26.070
{\an8}AND LET THEM REDEEM THEMSELVES
OR SINK.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.655

07:52.430 --> 07:54.932
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTS
ALIENS VERSUS HUMANS.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.517
{\an8}I'M SCREWED.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.768

07:57.852 --> 08:00.146

08:00.229 --> 08:03.065
- AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,
THE HUMAN-CANVAS JURY

08:03.149 --> 08:05.860
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.739
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.490
GOOD LUCK.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.910
- EVERY PART
OF THE BODY IS DIFFERENT.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.037
{\an8}DIFFERENT SKIN,
DIFFERENT ELASTICITIES.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.581
ALL THESE ARTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TATTOO ANY STYLE

08:18.664 --> 08:20.082
ON ANY PART OF THE BODY

08:20.166 --> 08:21.542
AND STILL HAVE
GOOD TECHNICAL APPLICATION.

08:21.626 --> 08:25.296
- KIND OF GOING
FOR A PINUP ALIEN ALMOST.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.089
- ARE YOU DOWN FOR, LIKE,
NEW-SCHOOL STYLE?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.507
- MM-HMM.
I LOVE NEW SCHOOL, ACTUALLY.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.508
- OKAY. THAT'S ME, THEN.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.760

- YEAH, CUZ.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.428

08:38.017 --> 08:38.726

08:43.313 --> 08:44.357
I CAN'T EVEN OPEN MY MOUTH.
I'M IN THAT MUCH PAIN RIGHT NOW.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.985
AND I CAN'T TATTOO TODAY
AT ALL.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.487
- IF WE DID SOMETHING
THAT WAS SMALLER--

08:49.570 --> 08:51.113
- I JUST--I SHOULD NOT BE
TATTOOING TODAY AT ALL.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.699

08:53.783 --> 08:57.620
{\an8}- I AM TAKING A HUGE RISK
OPTING OUT OF THIS TATTOO TODAY.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.747
I DIDN'T WALK AWAY
FROM MY ENTIRE LIFE TO COME HERE

08:59.830 --> 09:00.790
TO GO HOME LIKE THIS.

09:00.873 --> 09:01.749
BUT I WOULD RATHER GO HOME
RIGHT NOW

09:01.832 --> 09:05.211
THAN KNOWINGLY
GIVE THIS CANVAS A BAD TATTOO.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.588
- YOU LOOK STRESSED.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.632
- EVERYTHING I HAVE ON THIS
IS GOING TO RELY ON ONE SIDE.

09:09.715 --> 09:13.469
- SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TODAY?
- NOTHING ON HER.

09:13.552 --> 09:16.264
- SO SHE'S ONLY GETTING
ONE SIDE DONE?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.641
YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT SOME KIND
OF LITTLE WHISPIES OR ANYTHING?

09:18.724 --> 09:20.434
- I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING SMALL
AND SIMPLE ON THIS ONE SIDE.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.061
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE
ANY SENSE.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.397
{\an8}- AARON NEEDS TO MAN UP
AND TATTOO, ALL RIGHT?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.648
{\an8}OR GO THE HELL HOME.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.275
{\an8}- IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD
DEFINITELY TRY TO TATTOO TODAY.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.484
{\an8}- I CAN'T.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.820
{\an8}- NO PAIN IN THE WORLD
THAT WOULD STOP ME

09:30.903 --> 09:32.321
{\an8}FROM TATTOOING
IN THIS COMPETITION.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.906
GET OVER IT AND TATTOO.

09:43.499 --> 09:47.169
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS TO TATTOO
ONE OF YOUR CANVAS' GLUTES.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.588
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.216
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.
- LET'S DO THIS.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.510
- LET'S GET THIS STENCIL GOING.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.014
- JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THOSE LINES ARE SUPER VERTICAL

09:58.097 --> 10:00.474
AND SUPER STRAIGHT.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.184
I DEFINITELY HAVE
THE TOUGHEST CANVAS.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.060
SHE HAS THE DARKEST SKIN,

10:03.144 --> 10:04.895
AND SHE WANTS A LOT
OF BRIGHT COLORS.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.189
BUT I KNOW I CAN KILL
THIS TATTOO.

10:07.273 --> 10:07.940
I'M GONNA START IT OUT
WITH A LITTLE LINE, OKAY?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.651
- OKAY.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.194
{\an8}- TATTOOING SAVED MY LIFE.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.863
I WAS THIS POOR KID
THAT HAD TO STEAL EVERYTHING.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.657
IF IT WASN'T FOR TATTOOS,
I GUARANTEE I'D BE IN JAIL.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.704
- ARE YOU HATING ME YET, MAN?

10:21.787 --> 10:23.039
- NO, YOU'RE FINE.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.708
- CHRIS AND OLLIE
GAVE ME THE DAMN OCTOPUS.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.877
{\an8}'CAUSE OF THAT TREE
HYBRID BULL[bleep].

10:27.960 --> 10:29.378
- IT'S DEFINITELY
TWO SEPARATE ELEMENTS

10:29.462 --> 10:32.381
THAT JUST DON'T BLEND TOGETHER.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.215
- AND THAT'S FINE,
BECAUSE TODAY'S GOING TO BE

10:33.299 --> 10:35.593
MY [bleep] REDEMPTION.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.679
ALL I WANT TO DO IS [bleep]
TATTOO ALL GODDAMN DAY.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.723
ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE,
BROTHER.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.644
- THREE HOURS, GUYS.
THREE MORE HOURS.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.695
- I'M HAVING A MENTAL BATTLE
INSIDE OF MYSELF.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.905
THE JUDGES
ARE IN MY [bleep] HEAD.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.658
- THIS IS ONE OF THE ROUGHEST
ONES OF THE DAY, BY FAR.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.242
- IF I WAS STANDING
IN YOUR SHOES,

11:00.326 --> 11:02.953
I WOULDN'T FEEL SAFE.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.540
- ROBBIE'S ALIEN
IS VERY MANGLED, VERY CHEWED UP.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.752
{\an8}THE SKIN HAS GONE
THROUGH A LOT OF TRAUMA.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.420
- AH!
- I'M SURE THIS CLIENT

11:11.504 --> 11:15.257
IS NOT GOING TO BE UP FOR
VERY MUCH MORE WEAR AND TEAR.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.885
- 15 MINUTES REMAINING.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.349
- [exhales deeply]

11:23.432 --> 11:24.433
- YOU CAN DO IT.
- I'M GONNA DIE.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.561
- DON'T DIE.
I NEED YOU TO STAY ALIVE,

11:27.645 --> 11:29.855
BECAUSE I HAVE A WHOLE 'NOTHER
BUTT CHEEK TO TATTOO TOMORROW.

11:29.939 --> 11:34.485
{\an8}THIS GUY IS
IN SOME SERIOUS PAIN.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.113
IF MY CANVAS
IS NOT ABLE TO SIT FOR THIS,

11:37.196 --> 11:39.073
I AM TOTALLY SCREWED.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.911
{\an8}- IF AARON GETS TO STAY,
I WILL [bleep] HAUNT THAT DUDE.

11:43.994 --> 11:47.331
{\an8}- I'M NOT READY TO GO HOME.
THIS ISN'T MY [bleep] TIME.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.458
- TODAY YOU MUST COMPLETE--
- READY FOR THAT TWIST?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.169
- [bleep].
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.511
- HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?
- OH, [bleep].

12:00.594 --> 12:03.597
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

12:03.681 --> 12:06.142
TWO, ONE.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.854
MACHINES DOWN, TIME'S UP,
NO MORE TATTOOING.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.480
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- OH, MY GOD.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.274
WICKED AWESOME.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.608
- COME OVER AND LOOK
IN THE MIRROR.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.695
- YEAH, CRAZY PAIN,
BUT IT CAME OUT PERFECT.

12:17.778 --> 12:18.946
- READY TO DO ANOTHER ONE
TOMORROW?

12:19.029 --> 12:20.072
- I'M READY.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.115
- YEAH.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.325
- I'M NOT EVEN GONNA ASK
HOW YOU'RE FEELING,

12:23.409 --> 12:25.453
'CAUSE I KNOW THE ANSWER
ALREADY.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.872
- SO YOU'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND
JUST DO THE ONE SIDE TOMORROW?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.999
- THAT'S UP
TO HOW I FEEL IN THE MORNING.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.083
RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE [bleep].

12:31.167 --> 12:33.127
{\an8}- AARON'S A [bleep]
LITTLE BITCH.

12:33.210 --> 12:36.380
HE'S GOT A SORE TOOTH, AND NOW
ALL OF SUDDEN, HE CAN'T TATTOO?

12:36.464 --> 12:37.923
KICK THAT DUDE OUT OF HERE.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.425
- THE OTHER PEOPLE BUST
THEIR ASS

12:39.508 --> 12:40.718
TO DO TWO TATTOOS,
AND HE ONLY DOES ONE.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.178
- YEAH, I WOULD HAVE TOOK
THE DAY OFF TOO.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.512
- EXACTLY.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.848
- IF AARON GETS TO STAY
FOR DOING ONLY ONE TATTOO,

12:45.931 --> 12:46.849
I WILL [bleep] HAUNT THAT DUDE.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.018
- I DON'T THINK
AARON'S GOING ANYWHERE.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.269
- OKAY, SO WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU GO HOME?

12:50.352 --> 12:52.688
ARE YOU GONNA BE PISSED?

12:52.771 --> 12:55.774
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I'M NOT STRESSING IT.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.443
- NOT YET.

13:06.744 --> 13:10.247
- WHY ARE THERE SKULLS
OUT HERE?

13:11.790 --> 13:12.875
- MORNING, ARTISTS.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.252
YESTERDAY
YOU TATTOOED ONE GLUTE.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.839
THE FIRST 6 HOURS OF A 12-HOUR
GLUTEUS MAXIMUS TATTOO.

13:18.923 --> 13:23.302
AS YOU ALL KNOW,
AARON DID NOT TATTOO YESTERDAY.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.554
AARON, IF YOU TATTOO TODAY,

13:25.638 --> 13:29.016
THE JUDGES WILL HAVE TO DECIDE
IF YOUR WORK ON ONLY ONE GLUTE

13:29.099 --> 13:31.352
IS ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU
FROM BEING ELIMINATED.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.228
- RIGHT.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.146
- HOWEVER,
IF YOU DON'T TATTOO TODAY,

13:34.230 --> 13:35.689
YOU GIVE US NO CHOICE,

13:35.773 --> 13:38.859
AND YOU MUST PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP RIGHT NOW.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.445
WHAT'S YOUR DECISION?

13:41.529 --> 13:42.780
- I'M HERE TO TATTOO.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.658
I'M STILL IN TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS
OF PAIN,

13:45.741 --> 13:47.159
BUT I HAVE TO TATTOO TODAY.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.954
{\an8}I'M NOT READY TO GO HOME.
THIS ISN'T MY [bleep] TIME.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.413
NOT GIVING UP YET.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.333
- OKAY.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.252
MANY TIMES,
AS A TATTOO ARTIST,

13:56.335 --> 13:59.338
YOU MUST FINISH
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE STARTED.

13:59.421 --> 14:03.259
TODAY YOU MUST COMPLETE
ANOTHER ARTIST'S TATTOO.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.843
- [bleep].

14:04.927 --> 14:08.305
- AND ANOTHER ARTIST WILL BE
FINISHING WHAT YOU STARTED.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.391
- [sighs]

14:10.474 --> 14:13.352
ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

14:13.435 --> 14:14.812
{\an8}THIS IS BULL.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.231
- YOU MUST ALL GIVE
YOUR CURRENT DESIGN

14:17.314 --> 14:19.108
TO THE CANVAS'S NEW ARTIST.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.442
YOU CAN ALTER THE DESIGN
YOU'RE HANDED,

14:20.526 --> 14:24.321
BUT YOU CANNOT TOUCH THE GLUTE
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TATTOOED.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.659
{\an8}THIS IS THE ULTIMATE
HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISON

14:28.742 --> 14:32.955
{\an8}ON THE SAME CANVAS.
- WOW.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.957
- ON THE BOTTOM
OF THE SKULLS ARE NUMBERS.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.127
YOU WILL EACH DRAW A SKULL
TO DETERMINE A PICKING ORDER.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.379
YOU CANNOT CHOOSE
YOUR OWN CANVAS.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.257
JOSH, COME ON UP.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.011
- NUMBER ONE.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.929
- HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
- JUST [bleep] LUCK.

14:49.013 --> 14:49.888
YOU [bleep] DICK.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.809
{\an8}JOSH ALWAYS GETS A BREAK
EVERY TIME, MAN.

14:53.892 --> 14:54.435
BASTARD.

14:54.518 --> 14:58.731
- TY'ESHA.
- THREE.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.941
- CRIS.
- 12.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.986
- JASON.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.530
- TEN.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.282
- FIVE.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.951
- 11.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.163
- [sighs]

15:14.246 --> 15:14.663
13.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.415
- OH.
- OH!

15:16.498 --> 15:17.333
- HARD LUCK.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.460
{\an8}I'M GONNA BE STUCK
WITH WHATEVER CANVAS

15:19.543 --> 15:22.463
{\an8}NOBODY ELSE WANTS.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.547
- NINE.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.883
- SEVEN.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.426
- EIGHT.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.303
- SIX.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.679
- FOUR.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.514
- NUMBER TWO.
- [whistles]

15:32.598 --> 15:35.351
- LET'S BRING IN THE CANVASES.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.982
- SO WHERE'S THAT LAST...

15:42.066 --> 15:45.861
- AS YOU MAY NOTICE,
WE ARE SHORT ONE CANVAS.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.322
JOSH'S CANVAS
DID NOT RETURN TODAY.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.281
- THAT'S [bleep] UP.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.950
- DUDE, WHAT'D YOU DO
TO THAT GUY'S ASS?

15:52.034 --> 15:55.371
- SINCE AARON'S CANVAS
DID NOT GET A TATTOO YESTERDAY,

15:55.454 --> 15:59.708
SHE WILL GET TWO TATTOOS TODAY.
- WHAT?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.586
- THAT MEANS YOU'LL HAVE
TO WORK TOGETHER,

16:02.670 --> 16:04.380
AND...
- READY FOR THAT TWIST?

16:04.463 --> 16:07.216
- YOU'LL HAVE TO TATTOO HER...

16:07.299 --> 16:09.176
AT THE SAME TIME.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.803
- WOW.
- OH, MY GOSH.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.681
- I REALLY DON'T WANT
AARON'S CANVAS.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.808
{\an8}THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE ME
AND ANOTHER TATTOO ARTIST

16:15.891 --> 16:17.851
{\an8}PLAYING TUG-OF-WAR
WITH BUTT CHEEKS.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.480
- CANVASES, PLEASE SHOW
US YOUR TATTOOS.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.776
- A WHOLE LOT OF ASS.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.654
- JOSH, YOU CHOSE
SKULL NUMBER ONE.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.906
YOU'RE UP FIRST.
WHICH CANVAS DO YOU CHOOSE?

16:30.989 --> 16:34.451
- MY RIVAL'S CANVAS,
JASON, THE SHIP.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.245
{\an8}I LOVE SHUTTING JASON UP

16:36.328 --> 16:38.372
{\an8}AND SHOWING HIM THAT
I AM A BETTER ARTIST THAN HIM.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.040
- ERIK,
WHICH CANVAS DO YOU CHOOSE?

16:40.124 --> 16:42.084
- JULIA'S CANVAS.
- TY'ESHA?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.585
- I'LL TAKE CRIS' CANVAS.
- EMILY.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.879
- I CHOOSE TY'ESHA'S.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.424
{\an8}I LOST THE HEAD-TO-HEAD
AGAINST TY'ESHA LAST WEEK.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.134
I WANT REDEMPTION.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.051
I'M GOING TO MAKE HER LOOK

16:51.135 --> 16:54.263
LIKE SHE TATTOOS
LIKE A FIVE-YEAR-OLD.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.098
- ANGEL.
- I'LL TAKE EMILY'S.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.266
I KNOW I CAN BEAT EMILY.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.434
{\an8}SHE HAS A BIG MOUTH,

16:58.517 --> 17:01.478
{\an8}BUT NOT THAT GREAT OF WORK
TO BACK IT UP WITH.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.605
{\an8}- AARON.
- I'LL TAKE DON'S CANVAS--

17:03.689 --> 17:04.732
{\an8}THE BUTTERFLY.
- IT'S ALL THERE.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.900
{\an8}I JUST HAVE TO REPLICATE
WHAT HE ALREADY STARTED.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.695
AND IN MY CONDITION,
THIS IS THE SMARTEST MOVE.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.656
- ROBBIE.
- I'M GONNA TAKE ERIK'S CANVAS.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.116
- CLEEN.
- I'M GONNA GO WITH, UH...

17:17.869 --> 17:19.413
AARON'S CANVAS.
- WHOO-HOO.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.415
- NICE.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.000
{\an8}- I CHOSE THE HARDEST CANVAS
OF THE DAY

17:23.083 --> 17:26.211
{\an8}TO PROVE THAT I'M THE MAN,
AND I'M NOT SCARED OF NOTHING.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.505
- MARK.
- I CHOOSE ROBBIE'S CANVAS.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.133
- JASON.
- I CHOOSE MARK'S CANVAS.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.676
- NO-BRAINER.
- JULIA.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.636
- I CHOOSE CLEEN'S CANVAS.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.264
- BALLSY.
- CRIS.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.057
- I CHOOSE ANGEL'S.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.310
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:41.393 --> 17:42.853
- SO, DON, OBVIOUSLY THAT MEANS

17:42.936 --> 17:46.148
YOU'RE GOING TO BE TATTOOING
AARON'S CANVAS WITH CLEEN.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.275
{\an8}- CLEEN HAS BEEN AT THE TOP
OF THIS COMPETITION,

17:48.358 --> 17:49.693
{\an8}BUT IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF,

17:49.777 --> 17:52.404
{\an8}IT SHOWS I'M RIGHT THERE
ON THE TOP TOO.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.656
- AFTER YOU CONSULT
WITH YOUR NEW CANVASES,

17:54.740 --> 17:56.992
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO THEIR OTHER GLUTE.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.370
BASED ON YOUR WORK
ON BOTH GLUTES,

18:00.454 --> 18:03.665
ONE OF YOU
WILL BE PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.833
- [exhales deeply]

18:04.917 --> 18:06.251
- GOOD LUCK.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.878
- THE BIGGEST PART
OF THIS CHALLENGE TODAY

18:07.961 --> 18:09.463
IS WE WANT THESE TWO TATTOOS

18:09.546 --> 18:11.340
{\an8}TO LOOK LIKE THEY WERE DONE
BY ONE ARTIST.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.716
- WHAT UP, HOMIE?
- HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

18:12.800 --> 18:15.260
- WHICHEVER ARTIST HAS
THE WEAKER TECHNICAL APPLICATION

18:15.344 --> 18:16.595
IS GONNA STICK OUT.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.056
- YOU WANT THE OTHER HALF
OF YOUR GLUTEUS MAXIMUS, SIR?

18:19.139 --> 18:20.265
- YES, MA'AM.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.938
{\an8}- TY'ESHA [bleep] UP THE FACE
ON HER SUGAR SKULL GIRL.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.397
LET ME SEE THE PETALS AGAIN.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.526
IT'S GONNA BE EASY TO TAKE
HER OUT WITH THIS TATTOO.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.694
SHE ALREADY [bleep] UP HER SIDE
SO BAD

18:32.778 --> 18:34.988
THAT THERE'S NO COMING BACK
FROM IT.

18:35.864 --> 18:39.243
{\an8}TOO BAD YOU'RE A FOLLOWER!

18:39.326 --> 18:40.702
{\an8}- I'M HERE TO [bleep] WIN!

18:40.786 --> 18:42.037
- BOTH OF THESE TATTOOS SUCK.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.039
- I'M NOT GONNA SAY
THAT SOMEBODY WON WITH THIS.

18:44.122 --> 18:44.164
- WOW.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.631
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S KIND OF FUNNY?

18:52.714 --> 18:55.634
MY OCTOPUS STENCIL--

18:55.717 --> 18:59.388
THE TENTACLES ARE A DIFFERENT
SIZE THAN THE ORIGINAL.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.056
I HAVEN'T MENTIONED
THAT TO ANGEL, YET.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.057
- OOH.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.561
- SO, HE MIGHT RUN
INTO SOME PROBLEMS.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.063
- THAT'S CRAZY.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.107
- EMILY'S BACK
TO BEING A SNEAKY LITTLE BITCH.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.400
SHE'S JUST AN IDIOT

19:11.483 --> 19:12.985
FOR TELLING ME SHE'S TRYING
TO SCREW OVER ANGEL,

19:13.068 --> 19:16.071
BECAUSE I HAVE NO LOYALTY
TO HER.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.620
- OH, THAT'S ALREADY
WHAT I'M DOING.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.873
- OKAY.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.583
- SEE, I KNEW THIS WAS COMING.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.501
EVERYONE KNOWS NOT TO TRUST
EMILY.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.003
{\an8}I REALIZED THE SIZE DIFFERENCE

19:31.086 --> 19:33.422
{\an8}BEFORE THE LITTLE BIRDIE
ACTUALLY FILLED ME IN.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.173
I'M GOING TO USE EMILY'S DESIGN,

19:35.257 --> 19:37.217
BUT I'M GONNA BEAT HER
AT HER OWN GAME.

19:40.178 --> 19:43.348
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO COMPLETE YOUR GLUTE TATTOO.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.935
REMEMBER, IF YOUR TECHNICAL
APPLICATION ISN'T FLAWLESS,

19:47.019 --> 19:49.062
YOU'LL BE PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.065
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.318
- LET'S DO THIS.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.445
- OKAY, GIRLY.
- LET'S GO.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.822
{\an8}- GETTING YOUR GLUTES
TATTOOED TWO DAYS IN A ROW

19:58.906 --> 20:00.282
{\an8}IS ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.367
TODAY MORE THAN EVER,
TECHNICAL APPLICATION'S

20:02.451 --> 20:03.619
IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO GET IN AND GET OUT,

20:03.702 --> 20:08.457
AVOIDING AS MUCH SKIN TRAUMA
AS POSSIBLE AND BEING EFFICIENT.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.626
- ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?
- I GUESS SO.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.002
- IT'S TOO LATE
TO TURN BACK NOW, RIGHT?

20:12.085 --> 20:15.505
- OH, MAN.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.467
OH, MY GOD.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.677
- THIS IS GONNA SUCK.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.516
- YOUR LEFT SIDE IS SO SWOLLEN.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.894
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO MATCH THIS UP PERFECTLY.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.812
{\an8}DON'S SIDE,
IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIZE

20:30.896 --> 20:32.314
{\an8}BECAUSE OF HER SWELLING.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.649
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.317
THIS IS JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT
WORKED SO HARD IN ONE DAY.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.320
I HAVE TO MAKE A TATTOO
IDENTICAL TO THE LEFT SIDE,

20:38.403 --> 20:41.323
BUT IF I CAN'T MATCH UP THE GOD
DAMNED STENCIL, I'M SCREWED.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.784
I MIGHT TRY AND DO IT AGAIN
WHILE YOU'RE LAYING DOWN.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.996
- OH, MY GOD.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.500
- OH, [bleep], MOTHER [bleep].

20:54.878 --> 20:55.837
- HOW YOU DOING OVER THERE,
JOSH?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.297
GETTING IT TOGETHER?

20:57.381 --> 20:58.256
- IT'S HAPPENING, MAN.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.424
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE, RIGHT?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.843
- THAT ONE TOOK ME DOWN
TO THE WIRE YESTERDAY.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.470
{\an8}- JASON SHOULD DEFINITELY BE
WORRIED.

21:03.553 --> 21:04.680
I DECIDED TO REDRAW IT.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.348
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST PRETTY WEIRD
AND WONKY TO ME.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.891
I CAN JUST TAKE WHAT HE DID,
SEE THE MISTAKES,

21:07.975 --> 21:09.184
AND IMPROVE UPON THOSE.

21:09.267 --> 21:12.479
GOING AGAINST ME,
HE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.942
- YOU READY?
- MM-HMM.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.031
- THREE HOURS REMAIN.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.869
- OH [bleep] BALLS.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.122
- FEELING IT.
- OH [bleep] [bleep].

21:30.205 --> 21:31.540
WHOO!
LORD.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.917
OH, GOD.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.171
- I'D SAY FOUR HOURS.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.881
- OH, MOTHER [bleep].

21:39.965 --> 21:42.843
IT LITERALLY FEELS LIKE MY ASS
IS BEING RIPPED OFF.

21:42.926 --> 21:43.510
OH, MY GOD.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.640
- DON IS DEFINITELY

21:48.724 --> 21:50.851
{\an8}RIPPING THIS GIRL
A NEW ASS [bleep] ON THIS ONE.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.394
IF SHE TAPS OUT
BECAUSE OF HIM...

21:52.477 --> 21:53.812
- HOLY [bleep] [bleep].

21:53.895 --> 21:54.855
- I AM GONNA BE SO PISSED.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.983
- NO, STOP.
NO.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.073
- IT'S GETTING THERE.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.408
CLEEN'S IN THE TOP,

22:06.491 --> 22:08.368
{\an8}AND I WANT TO GO UP
AGAINST THE BEST.

22:08.452 --> 22:12.789
{\an8}I KNOW THAT I CAN BEAT HIM
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.042
- WELCOME TO SWEETNESS.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.585
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS TRACE.

22:16.668 --> 22:20.756
- I CAN SEE STUFF HE DID
WHERE IT'S NOT TOO BRIGHT.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.258
SO I CAN LEARN
FROM HIS MISTAKES.

22:23.341 --> 22:24.259
- WHAT MISTAKE DID HE MAKE?

22:24.342 --> 22:28.013
- WELL, IT JUST
SEEMS A LITTLE FLAT TO ME.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.139
- JULIA'S GOT IT EASY TODAY

22:29.222 --> 22:31.099
{\an8}BECAUSE CLEEN ALREADY
HAD 100 PERCENT OF THE DESIGN.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.518
{\an8}ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS TATTOO,

22:33.602 --> 22:36.271
BUT I CAN ALREADY SEE
THAT HER OUTLINE IS NOWHERE NEAR

22:36.354 --> 22:37.397
AS NICE AS CLEEN'S.

22:37.481 --> 22:40.317
JULIA CAN DEFINITELY BE
IN TROUBLE.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.110
- ONE MORE HOUR REMAINING.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.654
- GOING GOOD,
GOING GOOD.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.573
- GETTING THAT NEW SCHOOL ON.
- HELL, YEAH.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.576
- ROBBIE REALLY GAVE
THIS BUTT A BEATING YESTERDAY.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.828
{\an8}ALL'S I GOT TO DO IS A CLEAN NEW
SCHOOL PIECE ON THE OTHER SIDE,

22:51.912 --> 22:54.039
{\an8}AND I GOT THIS.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.666
MY PARENTS HATED THE IDEA
OF ME TATTOOING.

22:56.750 --> 23:00.545
IF I GO HOME, IT'LL JUST BE
LIKE MY MOM SAYING, "SEE, MARK?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.130
I TOLD YOU SO.
SHOULD'VE JUST BEEN A PAINTER."

23:02.214 --> 23:04.341
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE TO DO.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.967
I'M HERE TO TATTOO.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.427
- AND WE'RE AT FULL KOI.
- OH, YEAH.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.180
{\an8}- THERE'S NO COMPARISON
BETWEEN ME AND MARK,

23:10.263 --> 23:13.058
{\an8}ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO
TATTOOING TRADITIONAL JAPANESE.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.936
{\an8}- THANKS, DUDE.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.562
MARK,
IF YOU SAY YOU DO JAPANESE WORK,

23:17.646 --> 23:20.148
YOU BETTER GO BACK
TO THE DRAWING BOARD, BRAH.

23:20.232 --> 23:26.279
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.322
MACHINES DOWN.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.033
NO MORE TATTOOING.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.327
- IT MATCHES UP PERFECTLY.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.996
- IT LOOKS SO NICE.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.832
- OH, WOW.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.710
- HOLY [bleep].

23:40.794 --> 23:42.671
- I THINK EMILY SHOULD BE
WORRIED ABOUT GOING HOME.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.297
HER LINE WORK SUCKS.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.674
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SATURATED.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.593
THIS IS A TECHNICAL APPLICATION
DISASTER.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.850
- ANGEL, I GOT TO ASK YOU,

23:54.933 --> 23:57.602
DID YOU FIGURE OUT
WHY THE TENTACLES DIDN'T MATCH?

23:57.686 --> 24:00.397
- I KIND OF REALIZED
YOU GAVE ME THE WRONG STENCIL

24:00.480 --> 24:02.315
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M A TATTOO ARTIST TOO.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.025
SO, RIGHT THERE, I SIZED IT UP.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.820
- DUDE, YOU TOOK MY EXACT
DRAWING THAT I HANDED YOU,

24:06.903 --> 24:09.781
AND DIDN'T CHANGE [bleep] ALL
EXCEPT PUT A WAVE OVER THE AREA

24:09.865 --> 24:10.949
THAT YOU COULDN'T CONNECT,

24:11.032 --> 24:13.243
BECAUSE I PURPOSELY
HANDED YOU A DRAWING

24:13.326 --> 24:15.912
THAT WAS 15% SMALLER
THAN THE OTHER SIDE.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.956
[cackles]

24:18.039 --> 24:18.999
- BUT, WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

24:19.082 --> 24:20.208
THAT'S [bleep] UP.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.627
- YOU ASKED FOR THE DRAWING.
I HANDED YOU THE DRAWING.

24:22.711 --> 24:23.879
- THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T TRUST
YOUR ASS, EMILY.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.046
- YOU NEVER ASKED
FOR THE RIGHT SIZE.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.298
- THAT'S PRETTY SHADY.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.925
- NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING
A [bleep] FIRE-BREATHING BITCH.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.635
- I'M NOT BEING A BITCH.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO, "I'M NOT

24:30.719 --> 24:32.262
GONNA BE A BITCH ANYMORE"?
- WOW.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.431
- I THOUGHT BEING
IN THE BOTTOM HUMBLED YOU.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.433
- I'M VERY [bleep] HUMBLE.
- YOU'RE NOT ACTING LIKE IT.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.226
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE AN ASS [bleep].

24:38.310 --> 24:40.187
- WHATEVER.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.498
- THIS WEEK,
YOU TATTOOED FOR 12 HOURS.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.418
SIX HOURS ON ONE GLUTE,
AND SIX HOURS ON ANOTHER GLUTE,

25:03.501 --> 25:04.628
FINISHING
ANOTHER ARTIST'S DESIGN.

25:04.711 --> 25:08.423
EACH GLUTE YOU TATTOOED
WILL BE COMPARED SIDE BY SIDE

25:08.506 --> 25:10.550
WITH THE OTHER ARTIST'S TATTOO
ON THE OTHER GLUTE.

25:10.634 --> 25:15.263
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,
AND ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.266
CLEEN AND JULIA,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.602
LET'S START WITH CLEEN'S SIDE.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.438
{\an8}YOUR DESIGN, OVERALL,
WAS REALLY SMART.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.899
{\an8}THE ADDITION OF THE BOW
TO BRING IT TO BOTH SIDES

25:25.982 --> 25:27.192
WORKED REALLY, REALLY WELL.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.485
- THE COLOR PALETTE'S NICE.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.029
IT WORKS WELL.
OVERALL, MAN, IT'S A GOOD JOB.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.822
- LET'S MOVE ON TO JULIA'S SIDE.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.115
{\an8}- IT DEFINITELY
DOESN'T STACK UP.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.408
{\an8}IF YOU LOOK AT THE LETTERS,

25:35.492 --> 25:38.245
{\an8}AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR TWO LITTLE
S'S AT THE END OF SWEETNESS,

25:38.328 --> 25:40.747
THEY LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE S
AT THE BEGINNING OF SWEETNESS.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.251
YOUR TECHNICAL APPLICATION
IS JUST NOT THERE.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.627
- LET'S POLL THE JUDGES.
- I THINK THAT JULIA

25:45.710 --> 25:48.713
MADE A SMART DECISION CHOOSING
THIS ONE, BUT IT'S OBVIOUS

25:48.797 --> 25:51.591
THAT CLEEN'S TECHNICAL
APPLICATION IS MUCH STRONGER.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.134
- CLEEN.
- CLEEN.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.178
- THE WINNER OF THE HEAD
TO HEAD COMPETITION IS CLEEN.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.972
CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.224
- THANK YOU.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.519
- UP NEXT, JULIA AND ERIK.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.478
{\an8}- I THINK JULIA'S
TECHNICAL APPLICATION

26:03.561 --> 26:06.606
{\an8}HERE IS LACKING
IN CERTAIN AREAS.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.441
{\an8}THE COLOR IN THAT FLOWER
COULD'VE BEEN A LOT BRIGHTER.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.777
{\an8}YOU COULD'VE LEFT
A LOT MORE OPEN SKIN

26:10.860 --> 26:11.987
{\an8}TO LET THAT THING BREATHE,

26:12.070 --> 26:13.655
{\an8}AND IT DOES KIND OF LOOK MUDDY.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.198
{\an8}- ERIK, LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR PIECE.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.700
{\an8}- TECHNICALLY, IT'S DONE NICE.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.326
{\an8}THE WAY YOU LET THE SKULL
BREATHE, THE WAY

26:18.410 --> 26:19.661
{\an8}THERE'S TONS OF SKIN IN THERE--

26:19.744 --> 26:23.498
{\an8}AT LEAST ONE SIDE
OF THIS LADY'S BUTT LOOKS NICE.

26:23.581 --> 26:24.374
- FINAL DECISION.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.959
- BASED
ON TECHNICAL APPLICATION,

26:26.042 --> 26:27.460
ERIK'S TATTOO IS MUCH NICER.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.837
- ERIK.
- ERIK.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.047
- THE WINNER OF THIS
HEAD TO HEAD IS ERIK.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.800
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.135
ERIK AND ROBBIE.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.344
- ALL RIGHT, ERIK.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.055
{\an8}TECHNICAL APPLICATION--THERE'S
A LOT OF REALLY CLEAN LINES,

26:39.139 --> 26:42.726
{\an8}A LOT OF NICE PAINTERLY EFFECT
SHADINGS, AND GOOD COLOR TONES.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.394
- ROBBIE.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.646
{\an8}- THE TREE
AND THE ICICLES--REALLY NICE.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.398
{\an8}BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
A GOOD FUNDAMENTAL

26:48.481 --> 26:49.649
{\an8}STRONG HOLD ON BACKGROUNDS.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.193
HIS SIDE, EVERYTHING
HAS A FLOW OR A MOVEMENT TO IT.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.571
YOUR SIDE, IT'S A LOT STIFFER,

26:54.654 --> 26:56.281
AND THAT'S THE BIG POINT
THAT STANDS OUT.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.198
- FINAL DECISION?
- ERIK.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.534
- ERIK.
- ERIK.

26:59.617 --> 27:00.368
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.747
ROBBIE AND MARK.
- WELL, ROBBIE,

27:03.830 --> 27:07.542
{\an8}THE MAIN THING HERE
IS YOUR TECHNICAL APPLICATION.

27:07.625 --> 27:11.046
{\an8}YOU CAUSED A LOT
OF DAMAGE TO THIS LADY'S SKIN.

27:11.129 --> 27:16.843
THERE IS SO MANY AREAS THAT ARE
JUST ABRASIVELY OVERWORKED.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.388
- LET'S MOVE ALONG
TO MARK'S TATTOO.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.766
{\an8}- I THINK THIS IS A CUTE
LITTLE NEW SCHOOL GIRL TATTOO.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.894
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT NICE SATURATION
IN YOUR BLUE, IN THE SKY,

27:25.977 --> 27:28.521
{\an8}AND TECHNICALLY, THIS IS
A VERY SOUND TATTOO.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.148
- FINAL DECISION?
- MARK.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.983
- MARK.
- MARK.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.401
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.405
UP NEXT, MARK AND JASON.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.532
{\an8}- MARK, I WOULD HAVE GONE SOFTER
BECAUSE IT'S A LADY--

27:39.616 --> 27:41.368
{\an8}NOT SUCH HARD BLACK
AT THE EDGES,

27:41.451 --> 27:43.411
{\an8}AND THE WATER'S A LITTLE BIT
STIFF.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.246
- LET'S MOVE ALONG TO JASON.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.498
{\an8}- SOME NICE, CLEAN LINE WORK.

27:46.581 --> 27:49.042
{\an8}THE LITTLE DETAILS
IN THE EYE LOOK REALLY NICE.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.877
{\an8}REALLY, MAN,
THIS IS A CLEAN TATTOO.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.004
- MARK VERSUS JASON?

27:53.088 --> 27:53.963
- GOING WITH JASON.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.465
- I'M GOING WITH JASON.
- JASON.

27:55.548 --> 27:58.093
- CONGRATULATIONS.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.010
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE NEXT TATTOO.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.596
JASON AND JOSH.
- ALL RIGHT, JASON.

28:01.679 --> 28:03.723
{\an8}THE PROBLEM I HAVE
WITH THIS TATTOO IS THE ROSES.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.309
{\an8}NO SKIN TO BREATHE,
NO HIGHLIGHTS--

28:06.393 --> 28:09.521
{\an8}JUST OVERSATURATED WITH TOO MANY
OF THE SAME TONES OF COLOR.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.940
THAT'S TECHNICAL APPLICATION.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.067
AND IT'S OFF, BIG TIME.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.777
- LET'S MOVE ALONG TO JOSH.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.611
{\an8}- YOU TOOK A LOT OF THE MISTAKES

28:16.694 --> 28:18.780
{\an8}IN JASON'S DRAWING
AND FIXED THEM.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.991
{\an8}YOU ATTACHED THE FORWARD SAILS
IN THE CORRECT MANNER.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.701
{\an8}LEAVING THE OPEN COLOR
IN THE ROSES

28:23.785 --> 28:25.286
LETS EACH ROSE STAND APART.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.122
I LIKE IT.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.665
- FINAL DECISION?
- JOSH.

28:28.748 --> 28:29.290
- I'M GONNA GO WITH JOSH.
- JOSH.

28:29.374 --> 28:33.753
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.755
- JOSH, YOUR CANVAS NEVER
CAME BACK AND GOT FINISHED UP,

28:35.839 --> 28:38.258
{\an8}SO THERE'S NO ONE
TO COMPARE YOU WITH.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.968
{\an8}BUT, THIS IS GREAT.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.386
- JOSH,
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT JOB

28:41.469 --> 28:43.805
OF CAPTURING THIS LOOK OF SPACE
WITH MINIMAL USE OF BLACK.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.890
IF THERE'S 12 PEOPLE BEHIND YOU,
I THINK NINE OR TEN

28:45.974 --> 28:48.810
OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO LIVE UP TO THIS.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.311
- NO NEED TO POLL THE JUDGES.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.479
THANKS, JOSH.
- THANK YOU.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.983
- WELL DONE.
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

28:55.066 --> 28:58.319
- DON AND AARON.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.654
- WELL, DON, REALISTICALLY MAN,
IT'S PRETTY CLEAN.

28:59.737 --> 29:02.240
{\an8}YOUR COLOR BLENDS
ARE REALLY NICE,

29:02.323 --> 29:03.491
{\an8}AND FOR THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE

29:03.575 --> 29:04.200
{\an8}YOU HAVE ON THE SKIN,
IT'S NICE SATURATION.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.078
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.705
- AARON, ON DAY ONE,

29:08.788 --> 29:12.125
YOU CHOSE TO NOT TATTOO
BECAUSE YOU WERE IN PAIN.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.502
THIS IS YOUR ONLY SHOT
IN PROVING...

29:14.586 --> 29:16.087
- YUP.
- THAT YOU DESERVE TO STAY HERE.

29:16.171 --> 29:16.796
{\an8}WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS ONE?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.673
{\an8}- I KNEW THAT I COULD DO IT

29:18.756 --> 29:19.924
{\an8}IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME,
AND I KNEW I COULD DO IT WELL.

29:20.008 --> 29:20.675
{\an8}I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T HAVE
DESIGNED IT LIKE THAT,

29:20.758 --> 29:21.759
BUT, IT WAS ALREADY
THERE.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.845
- I LIKED THE WAY
YOU ENDED THE WING BETTER.

29:23.928 --> 29:27.849
IT'S A MUCH CLEANER ENDING
THAN YOURS IS, DON.

29:27.932 --> 29:31.102
AND YOU'RE REALLY SCULPTED
BLACK OUTLINE WAS VERY CLEAN.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.812
- THANK YOU.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.522
- FINAL ANSWERS.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.065
- I'M GOING WITH DON.

29:36.149 --> 29:39.611
- I'M GOING WITH AARON.
- AARON.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.906
- CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU WON THIS HEAD TO HEAD.

29:42.989 --> 29:45.492
DON AND CLEEN.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.619
{\an8}- WELL, DON, OVERALL THIS TATTOO
IS REALLY STRONG.

29:47.702 --> 29:49.704
{\an8}I KNOW IT'S TRICKY WORKING
ON A BUTT CHEEK, ESPECIALLY WHEN

29:49.787 --> 29:50.788
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY
YANKING ON THE OTHER BUTT CHEEK.

29:50.872 --> 29:54.292
THE LINE WORK
HAS SO MANY INCONSISTENCIES

29:54.375 --> 29:57.670
GOING STRAIGHT DOWN THE ANCHOR
THAT IT REALLY STANDS OUT.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.880
- LET'S MOVE ALONG
TO CLEEN'S TATTOO.

29:58.963 --> 30:02.050
{\an8}- THE LINE WEIGHT DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE EXTERIOR

30:02.133 --> 30:03.927
{\an8}OF THE JEWELS AND THE LITTLE
LINES ON THE INSIDE

30:04.010 --> 30:06.221
{\an8}GIVE IT THAT CRISP, SHARP LOOK.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.306
TECHNICALLY,
THIS IS A VERY SOUND TATTOO.

30:08.389 --> 30:09.641
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

30:09.724 --> 30:12.560
SO IT'S TIME TO POLL THE JUDGES
BETWEEN DON AND CLEEN.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.479
- GOING WITH CLEEN.
- GOING WITH CLEEN.

30:14.562 --> 30:15.438
- CLEEN IT IS.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.482
- THANK YOU.
- CLEEN, CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.442
ANGEL AND CRIS.

30:19.526 --> 30:22.070
IN NO WAY DO THESE APPEAR

30:22.153 --> 30:24.405
{\an8}AS THOUGH THEY WORK TOGETHER
OR GO TOGETHER.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.241
{\an8}- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A HEAD TO HEAD

30:26.324 --> 30:28.910
{\an8}WITH THE SPARTAN
AND A PERSIAN.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.119
- I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO LOOK

30:30.203 --> 30:34.415
LIKE THEY WERE BATTLING
ON HIS BUTT TO GET IN THE CRACK.

30:34.499 --> 30:38.336
AND MY IDEA FOR IT WAS,
HE WAS COMING HOME FROM BATTLE

30:38.419 --> 30:39.546
TRYING TO GET TO HIS WIFE.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.464
- THAT DOESN'T COME ACROSS,
EITHER.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.049
- WELL, ANGEL,
JUST LOOKING AT YOUR PIECE--

30:43.132 --> 30:45.260
{\an8}THAT EXTERIOR OUTLINE
AROUND THE SHIELD

30:45.343 --> 30:48.930
{\an8}IS JUST PROBABLY SOME
OF THE WORST EXAMPLE OF OUTLINE.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.848
THE SHADING
IN THIS GUY'S TORSO--

30:50.932 --> 30:51.808
VERY SCRIBBLY.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.726
THIS NOT A WELL-EXECUTED TATTOO

30:53.810 --> 30:56.729
BY ANY MEANS.
- CRIS.

30:56.813 --> 30:57.772
- THIS IS THE BEST TATTOO
I'VE SEEN YOU DO HERE.

30:57.855 --> 31:01.484
{\an8}YOU DO HAVE SOME SOFT,
SMOOTH SHADING IN HERE.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.777
{\an8}I DO LIKE WHAT YOU DID
WITH THE NOSTRILS AND THE NOSE.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.947
{\an8}THIS IS DEFINITELY
YOUR SHINING MOMENT.

31:06.030 --> 31:06.531
- JUDGES, DO WE HAVE A DECISION?

31:06.614 --> 31:08.116
- CRIS.
- CRIS.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.450
- CRIS.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.869
CONGRATULATIONS.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.205
- NEXT UP, CRIS AND TY'ESHA.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.040
{\an8}LET'S TAKE A LOOK
A CRIS' TATTOO.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.627
{\an8}- TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, YOU HAVE
SOME MOMENTS OF NICE OUTLINE.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.212
{\an8}BUT REALISTICALLY, MAN,

31:21.296 --> 31:25.174
{\an8}THIS THING IS ALL KINDS
OF DISTURBING AND JUST ODD.

31:25.258 --> 31:29.012
I CAN'T EVEN RIP IT, REALLY,
'CAUSE IT'S SO [bleep] WEIRD.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.722
- LET'S MOVE ON TO TY'ESHA.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.641
{\an8}- IT IS A MORE UNDERSTANDABLE,
PLEASANT IMAGE,

31:33.725 --> 31:34.809
{\an8}BUT IT'S NOT AS SOUND.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.978
{\an8}THE AREAS ON HER NECK,
IN THE EYE SOCKET,

31:37.061 --> 31:40.648
IT'S NOT AS SATURATED
OR AS SMOOTH AS WHAT CRIS DID.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.816
I'M GONNA GO WITH CRIS.

31:41.899 --> 31:44.152
- JUST IN TERMS
OF AESTHETICALLY PLEASING,

31:44.235 --> 31:46.738
I'M GONNA GO WITH TY'ESHA.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.948
- I'M GONNA GO WITH TY'ESHA.
- TY'ESHA, CONGRATULATIONS.

31:49.032 --> 31:49.490
- THANK YOU.

31:49.574 --> 31:53.828
- TY'ESHA AND EMILY.

31:53.911 --> 31:56.831
{\an8}- WELL, TY'ESHA, THIS
IS A VERY UNATTRACTIVE TATTOO.

31:56.914 --> 32:01.044
{\an8}THAT GREEN, BAD SMELL,
STENCH--WHAT IN THE HELL?

32:03.421 --> 32:05.006
- LET'S MOVE ALONG TO EMILY.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.508
{\an8}- CONTINUING WITH MORE
OF THIS HORRIBLE GREEN,

32:07.592 --> 32:08.843
{\an8}SWIRLY BACKGROUND--

32:08.926 --> 32:09.677
{\an8}IT'S A BAD IDEA.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.846
YOU DID VERY MINIMAL OUTLINE,

32:11.929 --> 32:13.806
AND WHERE YOU DID
IT'S JUST NOT CONSISTENT.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.767
{\an1}- IT'S HARD TO PICK A WINNER OUT
OF EITHER ONE OF THESE THINGS.

32:15.850 --> 32:18.102
- I CAN'T, I'M NOT GONNA SAY
THAT SOMEBODY WON WITH THIS.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.312
- I MEAN, [bleep] THE DESIGNS.

32:19.395 --> 32:20.605
THIS IS TECHNICAL ABILITY.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.023
YOU CAN'T PICK
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM?

32:22.106 --> 32:23.358
- YOU GUYS
HAVE EQUALLY BAD OUTLINES.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.776
- YOU BOTH HAVE BAD OUTLINES.
I HAVE TO CALL IT--

32:24.859 --> 32:26.235
THEY BOTH LOSE ON THIS ONE.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.362
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.865
THERE IS NO WINNER
IN THIS HEAD TO HEAD CHALLENGE.

32:30.948 --> 32:32.367
- WOW.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.703
- EMILY AND ANGEL.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.082
LET'S ADDRESS EMILY'S SIDE
FIRST.

32:39.165 --> 32:42.418
{\an8}- THERE ARE SO MANY BAD AREAS
IN THESE TENTACLES.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.420
{\an8}SOME ARE SUPER THIN.
SOME ARE SUPER THICK.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.756
YOUR LITTLE UNDERSIDE SUCTION
CUPS ARE JUST HAPHAZARDLY--

32:46.839 --> 32:50.677
HALF CIRCLES.
VERY INCONSISTENT.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.178
- LET'S MOVE ALONG TO ANGEL.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.222
- SHE GAVE YOU A DRAWING
OF A SHARK?

32:54.305 --> 32:55.390
- YES.
- I DON'T REALLY LIKE

32:55.473 --> 32:58.226
{\an8}THE DESIGN.
I WILL SAY THIS IN YOUR FAVOR--

32:58.309 --> 33:00.687
{\an8}THE AREAS OF THE BLUE SWIRLS
IN THE BACKGROUND,

33:00.770 --> 33:03.064
{\an8}YOURS DO APPEAR TO BE SMOOTHER.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.524
- NO HAMMERHEAD LOOKS LIKE THAT.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.025
THEY DO NOT HAVE
THAT SHAPE HEAD.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.152
- WELL, I FOLLOWED THE CRAP
THAT SHE LAID OUT, SO--

33:08.236 --> 33:09.946
- YOU SHOULD'VE REDRAWN IT
IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS [bleep].

33:10.029 --> 33:10.738
- [bleep] DID SOMETHING
THAT YOU ACTUALLY

33:10.822 --> 33:12.156
OUTLINED, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:12.240 --> 33:14.075
- I'M HERE TO [bleep] WIN.
IF YOU WANT TO GO HOME, GO HOME.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.118
- I SHOULD'VE JUST FOLLOWED
MY OWN.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.411
- [bleep] YOU.
- [bleep] YOU, TOO.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.954
- Y'ALL CAN [bleep] EACH OTHER
ALL YOU WANT.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.664
BOTH THESE TATTOOS SUCK.

33:19.747 --> 33:20.748
- FINAL DECISION?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.084
- DROP THE AESTHETICS,
AND I'MA GO WITH ANGEL.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.253
JUST BECAUSE THE SMOOTHER COLOR
BLENDS.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.588
- I'LL GO WITH ANGEL.
- I'LL GO WITH ANGEL AS WELL.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.092
WINNER OF THIS HEAD
TO HEAD CHALLENGE IS ANGEL.

33:31.175 --> 33:35.012
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

33:35.096 --> 33:36.764
AND THEY WILL CHOOSE
THE ONE GLUTEUS MAXIMUS

33:36.848 --> 33:39.016
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.103
IT'LL PUT TWO ARTISTS
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.981
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK

33:45.064 --> 33:46.899
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.530
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
- DO YOU GUYS THINK

33:52.613 --> 33:54.532
AARON'S GOING DOWNSTAIRS?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

33:54.615 --> 33:55.616
- NO, PEOPLE
THAT HAVE TWO LOSSES--

33:55.700 --> 33:56.784
- I MEAN,
IT SUCKS THAT HE WAS SICK.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.744
- I MEAN,
IT WASN'T TERRIBLE AT ALL.

33:57.827 --> 33:58.745
DEFINITELY WASN'T AS BAD
AS THAT OCTOPUS.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.913
- WOULD YOU SHUT THE [bleep] UP?

34:00.997 --> 34:01.539
- THAT OCTOPUS WAS TERRIBLE.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.292
- I WAS PROUD OF MY WORK.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.002
THEY DIDN'T LOVE IT.
- NOBODY DID.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.463
- DUDE, SERIOUSLY, SHUT UP.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.590
- HE SHOULD'VE
TOOK YOUR CRAPPY-ASS SHARK,

34:10.672 --> 34:12.300
AND REDRAWN IT,
AND THEN SMOKED YOU.

34:12.382 --> 34:13.967
- I WON BY THE SKIN OF MY TEETH.
- YOU DID.

34:14.051 --> 34:15.469
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- AND I TELL YOU THIS MUCH--

34:15.553 --> 34:17.554
I BLAME MYSELF
FOR THAT BAD CRITIQUE,

34:17.638 --> 34:20.141
BECAUSE I FOLLOWED DRAWINGS
THAT YOU SET OUT.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.976
WHY DIDN'T I TAKE IT UPON MYSELF
TO ACTUALLY DRAW MY OWN [bleep]?

34:22.059 --> 34:24.687
BECAUSE I KNOW I'M BETTER
THAN WHAT YOU DO.

34:24.771 --> 34:25.897
- DUDE, I'M HERE TO FIGHT

34:25.980 --> 34:27.982
TO THE VERY LAST DROP OF BLOOD
I HAVE IN MY GOD [bleep]--

34:28.065 --> 34:29.484
- THE ONE THING
THAT I DID [bleep] WRONG--

34:29.567 --> 34:30.985
- AND YOU'RE GONNA STAND UP AND
IN FRONT OF THE [bleep] JUDGES--

34:31.068 --> 34:32.402
- THE ONE THING
THAT I [bleep] DID WRONG--

34:32.487 --> 34:33.612
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

34:33.696 --> 34:34.655
- AND THEN
IF YOU WANT TO [bleep] MY--

34:34.739 --> 34:36.364
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]--
- STOP.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.909
- MY [bleep] [bleep] [bleep],
- [bleep] YOU.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.409
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I DECIDED
TO RUN WITH YOUR BULL [bleep]!

34:39.494 --> 34:40.369
- BOO [bleep] HOO!

34:40.453 --> 34:41.871
- MAN,
THIS ABOUT THE ARTWORK, MAN.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.456
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
FOLLOWED YOUR BULL [bleep].

34:43.539 --> 34:44.165
WHY THE [bleep] DID I TAKE IT?

34:44.248 --> 34:46.501
- TOO BAD YOU'RE A FOLLOWER!

34:54.175 --> 34:57.220
- TODAY, WE'RE LOOKING
AT TECHNICAL APPLICATION

34:57.303 --> 34:58.846
WITH 12-HOUR GLUTE TATTOOS.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.349
- THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

35:01.432 --> 35:04.685
THAT I CAN LOOK AT APPROACHING
WHO GOES HOME AND WHY.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.146
I HAVE ROBBIE BECAUSE OF THE WAY
THAT THAT TATTOO TURNED OUT.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.691
HE DID A LOT OF UNNEEDED TRAUMA
TO THE SKIN.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.902
THIS TATTOO WILL NOT HEAL WELL.

35:12.985 --> 35:13.945
- LET'S TALK ABOUT JULIA.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.072
{\an8}SHE FINISHED UP CLEEN'S CANDY
SCENE.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.366
{\an8}- I JUST CAN'T STAND
WHAT SHE DID,

35:18.449 --> 35:20.201
{\an8}AND I THINK THAT SHE
HAD THE EASIEST ROUTE.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.161
- THERE'S NOT PRECISE LINE WORK
IN THIS THING.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.204
LETTERS ARE MISSHAPEN.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.497
THEY'RE WRONG.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.082
- IN THAT SAME BREATH, EMILY

35:26.165 --> 35:30.127
{\an1}IS STRUGGLING WITH APPLICATION
AND CLEARLY WITH DESIGN CHOICES.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.921
- BAD BACKGROUND, BAD LAYOUT,

35:32.004 --> 35:33.464
AND THESE SUCTION CUPS--

35:33.548 --> 35:35.091
THEY JUST LOOK LIKE CORN
ON THE COB, MAN.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.885
{\an8}- AND SHE LOST ON BOTH HEAD
TO HEAD CHALLENGES.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.887
{\an8}SO, JULIA LOST BOTH
HEAD TO HEAD,

35:39.971 --> 35:41.764
BUT I THINK THAT SOME OF JULIA'S
DESIGNS WERE AT LEAST--

35:41.848 --> 35:44.392
- JULIA'S BETTER THAN EMILY.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.310
- YOU GOT TO WONDER
HOW THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

35:46.394 --> 35:47.603
IS VOTING RIGHT NOW.
- ABSOLUTELY.

35:47.687 --> 35:51.774
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAS THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.734
THIS IS MARK AND JASON'S TATTOO.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.070
{\an8}- THERE'S NO SIMILARITIES

35:56.153 --> 35:58.114
{\an8}BETWEEN JASON AND MARK'S LINE
WORK, COLOR, SHADING--

35:58.197 --> 36:01.117
- IT LOOKS LIKE
TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE IMAGES.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.911
- MARK'S SIDE
LOOKS LIKE A BLOB OF BLACK.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.539
- THE FLOWER'S KIND OF DROWNING
IN ALL THE BLACK.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.583
THAT [bleep] DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.001
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:10.084 --> 36:12.795
ROBBIE DID THE ALIEN,
AND MARK DID THE GIRL.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.547
{\an8}IT'S LIKE TWO
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS.

36:14.630 --> 36:15.798
{\an8}- IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE ONE PIECE.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.717
- EXACTLY.
- I THINK ROBBIE COULD HAVE

36:17.800 --> 36:19.427
SPREAD OUT THE PICTURE
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.304
IT LOOKS
LIKE EVERYTHING'S JUST SMUSHED.

36:21.387 --> 36:24.098
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
SKINNED YOUR BUTT CHEEK.

36:24.181 --> 36:25.349
- IT WAS VERY ROUGH.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.350
IT HURTS.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.352
BUT HE WAS A GREAT ARTIST
TO BE WITH.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.687
LIKE, HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.148
- WELL, FRIENDLY AIN'T GONNA
WIN YOU THE COMPETITION.

36:32.231 --> 36:34.942
- HAVE WE REACHED OUR DECISION?
all: YES.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.361
- ABSOLUTELY.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.615
- I CAN'T [bleep] BELIEVE
THAT I'M NOT DONE YET.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.992
- ONCE THEY SAY "YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER,"

36:43.075 --> 36:45.912
THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

36:45.995 --> 36:48.289
- OH, OH.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.458
- [bleep].

36:50.541 --> 36:53.377
- ALL RIGHT, THE JUDGES WANT
TO SEE...

36:53.461 --> 36:56.130
EMILY,

36:56.213 --> 36:57.632
ROBBIE,

36:57.715 --> 36:59.717
MARK,

36:59.800 --> 37:02.595
AND JASON.

37:02.678 --> 37:06.307
WE'LL SEE YOU AND YOUR RIVALS
DOWNSTAIRS.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.100
- WHAT?
- WHY JASON?

37:08.184 --> 37:09.352
- WELL, THE SUSPENSE
IS KILLING ME.

37:18.486 --> 37:21.948
- THIS WEEK, YOU HAD TO SHOW
FLAWLESS TECHNICAL APPLICATION

37:22.031 --> 37:23.532
BY TATTOOING GLUTES.

37:23.616 --> 37:28.454
MARK AND JASON, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

37:28.537 --> 37:33.709
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOOS OF THE DAY.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.086
- WHAT?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.212
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
OUT OF THIS MANY PEOPLE

37:36.295 --> 37:37.296
THAT GOT THEIR ASSES TATTOOED,

37:37.380 --> 37:38.381
AND THEY CHOSE THAT?
- IT'S CRAZY.

37:38.464 --> 37:41.217
DID SHE PISS OFF THE REST
OF THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY?

37:41.300 --> 37:43.177
'CAUSE SHE HAS
AN AWESOME TATTOO.

37:43.260 --> 37:45.763
- THIS IS WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING
EVERY DAY--IS MY KOI FISH.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.682
THAT IS SOLID.
THERE'S CLEAN LIKE WORK.

37:47.765 --> 37:48.724
THERE'S SMOOTH SHADING.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.850
I CAN NAME
ALL DOWN THE [bleep] LINE HERE--

37:49.934 --> 37:51.018
THE REST OF THE TATTOOERS

37:51.102 --> 37:53.437
THAT DIDN'T EVEN
COME CLOSE TO THAT.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.523
- IF THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
NEEDS TO BORROW MY GLASSES,

37:55.606 --> 37:57.942
HERE THEY ARE,
BECAUSE THAT TATTOO IS AWESOME.

37:58.025 --> 38:01.278
- WE DO NOT AGREE
WITH THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.697
- AND I'LL TELL YOU STRAIGHT UP,

38:02.780 --> 38:04.699
ANGEL AND JULIA SHOULD BE
STANDING WHERE Y'ALL ARE.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.201
- I CERTAINLY AGREE.
- ROBBIE.

38:07.284 --> 38:09.203
- THE MAIN REASON
YOU'RE DOWN HERE,

38:09.286 --> 38:11.372
ROBBIE, IS BECAUSE
OF YOUR TECHNICAL APPLICATION.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.289
CAUSING SOMEONE THAT MUCH TRAUMA

38:12.373 --> 38:15.710
ON THEIR SKIN
IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE.

38:15.793 --> 38:18.337
- THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE,
A HUGE HICCUP,

38:18.421 --> 38:19.964
AND I'M BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS
AT THIS MOMENT.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.091
I MEAN, I SHOWED YOU WAY

38:22.174 --> 38:23.968
BETTER TECHNICAL APPLICATION
IN THE TATTOO

38:24.051 --> 38:26.595
I DID AFTER THIS BECAUSE I
MADE MISTAKES IN THIS ONE,

38:26.679 --> 38:28.139
AND I DIDN'T GO BACK TO THOSE.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.975
- THIS IS A MAJOR MISFIRE.
MAJOR.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.351
- THIS ISN'T WHAT I DO.

38:32.435 --> 38:33.644
THIS ISN'T WHO I AM.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.730
I JUST WANT ONE MORE [bleep]
CHANCE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.024
IF I GO HOME NOW,

38:38.107 --> 38:40.901
I'M GONNA FEEL LIKE
THE BIGGEST [bleep] FAILURE.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.820
- CALM DOWN, BROTHER.
BREATHE.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.697
- I'M JUST HAVING A [bleep]
MOMENT.

38:44.780 --> 38:45.948
[sniffles]

38:46.032 --> 38:49.076
- ROBBIE, DON'T BEG.
JUST FIGHT.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.246
- EMILY.
- I THINK OVERALL,

38:52.329 --> 38:54.457
THIS TATTOO
IS VERY AWKWARD.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.418
- I'VE BEEN HERE TWICE NOW,
AND TWICE IS ENOUGH FOR ME.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.253
I EAT, BREATHE, SLEEP--

38:59.336 --> 39:01.464
EVERYTHING IS TATTOO TO ME.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.465
I'M HERE TO COMPETE,

39:02.548 --> 39:04.383
AND I'M HERE
TO WIN THIS [bleep].

39:04.467 --> 39:06.594
- WHEN YOU GIVE US THINGS
LIKE YOU'RE GIVING US,

39:06.677 --> 39:09.472
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
THAT IS GONNA WIN THIS THING.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.517
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:20.149 --> 39:25.863
ROBBIE, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.782
- REALLY, MAN, THIS IS
JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER THE LINE.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.366
IT WAS HURT.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.243
- THE OTHER SIDE--
YOU PICKED THE BALL BACK UP.

39:31.327 --> 39:34.080
THIS IS STRICTLY BASED
ON THAT ONE THING,

39:34.163 --> 39:35.664
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE'S NOTHING MORE

39:35.748 --> 39:38.667
THAT I WANT
THAN TO SEND HER HOME.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.712
NOTHING.
BUT, IT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.174
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

39:48.427 --> 39:51.472
- HONESTLY,
IT WAS A REALLY CLOSE DECISION.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.974
ANGEL AND JULIA SHOULD BE
STANDING WHERE Y'ALL ARE.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.144
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE
NOT DOWN HERE IS A TRAVESTY.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.481
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
YOU CAN HEAD BACK.

40:00.564 --> 40:03.234
- I'M SURE YOU'LL LET EVERYBODY
UP THERE KNOW HOW IT WENT DOWN.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.402
- OH, YEAH.

40:07.154 --> 40:11.158
- I GOT BEAT AT NEW SCHOOL BY
A GUY THAT DON'T DO NEW SCHOOL.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.828
THAT PISSES ME OFF
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.329
IF I COULD'VE GOTTEN
OUT OF MY HEAD,

40:15.413 --> 40:17.206
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LOT BETTER OFF.

40:20.417 --> 40:23.337
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER.</i>

40:23.420 --> 40:26.423
- YOU MUST TATTOO
IN TEAMS OF THREE.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.467
- WHAT?
- I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.344
- THIS COULD BE A DISASTER.

40:30.427 --> 40:31.637
- [bleep]

40:31.720 --> 40:34.265
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE'S
STABBING ME FROM THE INSIDE.

40:35.724 --> 40:38.227
- NOW I GOT TO PROVE MYSELF
TO THEM, GET THE [bleep] MONEY,

40:38.310 --> 40:39.395
AND GO THE [bleep] HOME.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.688
- DON'T YOU DARE TALK TO ME

40:40.771 --> 40:42.189
ABOUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
AND WHAT'S NOT.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.440
YOU WEREN'T IN THAT GOD
DAMNED BATHROOM

40:43.524 --> 40:45.067
WATCHING ME DIE ON THE FLOOR.

40:45.151 --> 40:48.195
- YOU HAVE VERY FEW AREAS OF
PRECISION IN THE ENTIRE TATTOO.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.071
- THERE'S NO CLEAR BOTTOM
THAT WE'VE SEEN.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.365
- THAT LOOKS VERY KINDERGARTEN.

40:51.448 --> 40:53.868
- ALL OF YOU HAVE
AN IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE.
