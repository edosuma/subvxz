"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.033 --> 00:36.100
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.133 --> 00:38.667
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.700 --> 00:40.867
in a court of law.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.667
-Male officer:
I grew up in Spokane.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.133
Got hired by
the sheriff's department,

00:46.167 --> 00:47.867
and I'm working graveyard now.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.700
Which I really enjoy.

00:49.733 --> 00:53.433
It's nice working the night
hours where you're getting
a lot of in-progress crime.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.600
You know, it's a great
opportunity to serve
the community

00:55.633 --> 00:57.533
when most folks are sleeping.

00:57.567 --> 00:59.467
There's quite a bit of action.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.067
-(siren wails)

01:01.067 --> 01:07.433
-(radio chatter)

01:11.533 --> 01:13.967
-We've got a vehicle failing
to yield right now.

01:14.067 --> 01:16.600
Our deputy tried to pull him
over, but he's taken off on him.

01:16.633 --> 01:19.067
We're gonna try to get
into position here.
We can jump in behind him.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.100
We've got a red light
coming up.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.867
He's gonna be southbound
on the ave.

01:22.900 --> 01:25.600
-Man on radio:
Southbound on avenue...
(continues indistinct)

01:25.633 --> 01:28.600
-Woman on radio:
Copy, southbound,
going the wrong way...

01:28.633 --> 01:32.067
-(radio chatter continues)

01:37.667 --> 01:40.800
-We've got a number of officers
that are getting ahead of us
with Stop Sticks,

01:40.833 --> 01:43.333
which gives us a good chance
to eliminate this thing.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.300
-Woman on radio:
6-0, 138 Woodley and...

01:45.333 --> 01:48.867
-Man on radio: Negative six.
-Woman on radio: Negative
on the six.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.933
-Looks like he saw our officer
pulled over on the side
of the road,

01:51.967 --> 01:56.633
so he took a turn eastbound
to avoid the sticks.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.633
We don't have a whole lot
of traffic out right now,

01:58.667 --> 02:00.500
so keep it going
for now.

02:01.733 --> 02:03.633
You know, we want to do our best
to get this car stopped.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.067
He's putting the community
at risk with his driving.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.633
-Woman on radio:
Northbound 38, from 200.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.200
-This thing's covered
quite a bit of ground,

02:09.233 --> 02:12.333
maintaining speeds between
60 and 90.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.533
-(radio chatter)

02:14.567 --> 02:16.067
-He's getting ready
to bail.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.867
-Just went through a field,
heading now back out on 176.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.700
-Copy, back on 176.

02:21.733 --> 02:23.133
-Over, over.

02:23.167 --> 02:26.667
-Whoever's in the Crown Vic,
you sparked it, be careful.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.433
-Looks like our officer
here in the Crown Vic

02:28.467 --> 02:32.367
may have hit the Stop Sticks
or a rock or something
as he went through the field.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.800
-We just turned northbound
on the dead-end dirt road,
gravel road.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.100
-Copy, northbound,
dead-end, gravel road.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.400
-He's out, he's out!
-Copy.

02:41.433 --> 02:43.167
-So he's gonna be out on foot.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.500
-(shouting)

02:47.533 --> 02:49.133
-You got passengers anywhere?

02:49.167 --> 02:50.667
-Step out of the car!

02:50.700 --> 02:52.600
Step out of the car!

02:52.633 --> 02:54.067
We're standing by.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.600
-Two females in the car.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.633
-(siren continues wailing)
-(indistinct chatter)

03:02.067 --> 03:04.300
-Okay.
-Woman on radio: Anyone have
the description on our driver?

03:05.433 --> 03:06.967
-Get out, get out!

03:07.067 --> 03:08.300
-I didn't--
-Get out!

03:08.333 --> 03:09.733
-On the ground.
-Down.

03:09.767 --> 03:11.433
-Where's the driver?

03:11.467 --> 03:12.700
-Stay down.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.900
-Everybody out.
Face down, right here.
-(muttering)

03:15.933 --> 03:18.800
-Hey, let's clear out from
the car so we can bring
the dog out.

03:18.833 --> 03:21.567
Hey, calm down.
Who was driving?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.067
Who was driving?
-Where'd the driver run?

03:23.067 --> 03:25.800
-The driver, he just--
-We don't even know him,
he picked us up!

03:25.833 --> 03:28.867
-He picked us up.
-(indistinct shouting)

03:28.900 --> 03:31.067
-What does he look like?
-Look at my (bleep)...

03:31.067 --> 03:33.100
-What does he look like?
-Are you done?

03:33.133 --> 03:34.933
-What does he look like?
-Are you done?

03:34.967 --> 03:36.833
Hey, are you done?

03:36.867 --> 03:38.167
-Jimmy.
-Where'd he go?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.367
-I was right here on them,
I didn't see anyone get out.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.100
And the car was still closed
when I ran up.

03:42.133 --> 03:44.633
-No! No, no, no. He did.
He dipped out.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.500
-Okay, let's--
-I don't know what happened.

03:46.533 --> 03:47.867
-Let's separate them.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.100
-Get up, get up.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.967
-Hey, Nick, take her
to your car.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.500
-So you're saying
she was on the center console?

03:53.533 --> 03:55.667
-I was right on top of them
when they crashed through here.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.467
-We went there and didn't
see anybody run.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.733
-Door never opened.
I was right here.

03:59.767 --> 04:01.367
-I never saw a driver
or anything.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.733
-She was driving.
Look how far the seat's up.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.400
And the other one
was sitting here.

04:05.433 --> 04:07.167
She was sitting up
on the center console
like this.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.367
-Yeah.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.467
-She was driving.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.900
-Let's just chat with her
right here.

04:10.933 --> 04:12.600
What does the driver
look like?

04:12.633 --> 04:14.333
-He looks Mexican.

04:14.367 --> 04:15.767
-How old?

04:15.800 --> 04:17.733
-I don't know.
I don't know his name.
I don't know him.

04:17.767 --> 04:19.800
-He's not asking you
his name, he's asking
you how old is he?

04:19.833 --> 04:22.300
Is he 60, 20, 5?
How old?

04:22.333 --> 04:24.267
-Older. Like, your age.
Like, older.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.967
-Okay.
-I don't know him.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.200
I don't know him.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.533
-You need to tell us
what he looks like.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.667
-He looks... like a Mexican.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.500
-What kind of clothes
is he wearing?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.133
-You don't know because--

04:36.167 --> 04:38.133
-Black pants.
-Because there was no
other driver.

04:38.167 --> 04:40.533
That's why you can't
think of who he was.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.667
-No, I promise.
I promise. Please, I promise.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.533
I promise. I'll get down
on my hands and my knees!

04:44.567 --> 04:46.533
-Then you tell us what'd
he look like, and what he's
wearing.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.333
-In the name of Jesus, please!

04:48.367 --> 04:51.233
-Listen, when you stopped
your car, we had an officer
on the left side-- No, listen.

04:51.267 --> 04:53.667
-I tried.
-We had an officer on the left
side, the right side of you,

04:53.700 --> 04:56.233
and one behind you, so where
does the driver go if the doors
don't open?

04:56.267 --> 04:59.233
-Okay, and I promise to you,
I promise!

04:59.267 --> 05:01.100
-Okay.
-Please, sir!

05:01.133 --> 05:02.567
-Calm down, calm down.
-I promise!

05:02.600 --> 05:04.067
-Stop yelling at me,
calm down. Okay?

05:04.100 --> 05:07.100
-Because I was going home
and my friend was catching
the bus.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.800
We were catching the--
(groans)

05:09.833 --> 05:11.900
God knows.
God is my witness.

05:11.933 --> 05:14.167
God is my--
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?

05:14.200 --> 05:16.433
-Okay, we're gonna take
our dog to the driver's seat
of the car--

05:16.467 --> 05:18.067
-Do you believe
in Jesus Christ?

05:18.067 --> 05:19.967
-We're gonna take him to
the driver's seat of the car.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.400
-He died on our sins.

05:21.433 --> 05:23.933
I got baptized, please!

05:23.967 --> 05:25.567
I'm not driver!

05:25.600 --> 05:27.200
I'm 19.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.433
I work at Sizzler!

05:29.467 --> 05:31.867
I got my GED.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.567
I don't drive, I don't
have a license.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.267
Please, sir,
what the (bleep)?

05:37.300 --> 05:39.633
Honest to God,
it was a mistake.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.767
I'm sorry.
-We're gonna toss you
in the car, okay?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.867
-18 years old, you're an
adult, right?

05:44.900 --> 05:47.100
So you're looking at two
very adult charges.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.067
Felony elude, running
from the cops.

05:49.067 --> 05:51.867
Assault One, trying to run over
a deputy when you guys
cut through that person's yard.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.333
Okay, and right now,
both of you are going down
with that.

05:54.367 --> 05:55.967
-I didn't do it.

05:56.067 --> 05:59.067
-Okay, if you didn't
do it, who did it?

05:59.067 --> 06:01.500
If you're trying to
protect your friend,
it's probably not a good idea.

06:01.533 --> 06:03.433
-'Cause she's
not protecting you.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.333
We're trying to give you
an opportunity to tell
the truth.

06:05.367 --> 06:07.633
Any friend that put you
in this spot, they are not
worth this.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.400
We can start over again,
if you want to.

06:10.433 --> 06:13.567
-We weren't driving.
Like, it was that Mexican dude.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.233
-Okay. The guy that the dog
tracked and couldn't find?

06:16.267 --> 06:17.400
-We're done.
-We're done here.

06:17.433 --> 06:19.100
-Please?
-Nope.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.433
Here. Square one.
Ready?

06:22.467 --> 06:24.167
It's a yes or no.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.833
Was Aaliyah driving
the vehicle?

06:25.867 --> 06:27.733
-Yes.
-Yes?

06:27.767 --> 06:29.833
Okay.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.200
And what'd she say
while she was running
from you? From us?

06:32.233 --> 06:36.433
-She said she had warrants
for her arrest-- She had
warrants.

06:36.467 --> 06:37.767
-Okay, which is why
she was running?

06:37.800 --> 06:38.933
-Yes.

06:38.967 --> 06:40.633
-Okay, did you ever
tell her to stop
at all?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.600
-Yeah, I told her to stop,
to pull over. She didn't want
to pull over.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.500
-Okay. What'd she say
when she saw all the deputies?

06:45.533 --> 06:47.600
Was she freaking out?
-Yes.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.333
-What about all of the
Stop Sticks?
-She started screaming.

06:50.367 --> 06:51.633
-With the Stop Sticks?

06:51.667 --> 06:53.700
-She was--

06:53.733 --> 06:55.333
-She was driving good.
I'll give her that.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.367
Okay, sit tight.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.500
So I got some bad news.

07:00.533 --> 07:04.867
Wendy told us
you were driving the car.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.267
-She's lying!

07:06.300 --> 07:08.233
-And you were running
because you had warrants
for your arrest.

07:08.267 --> 07:09.567
-No, I wasn't!

07:09.600 --> 07:11.467
-That's what she told us,
she said that.

07:11.500 --> 07:15.367
-She's-- Look at me. Are you
kidding me? I was praying
in the backseat the whole time.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.467
-Okay.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.100
-No! No, that's a lie.

07:19.133 --> 07:20.800
-I'm believing her.
-That's a lie.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.067
-I was not in the front seat.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.900
Why is she lying?
-We saw you in the front seat.

07:25.933 --> 07:29.300
-She probably--
Oh, she probably likes him.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.267
-All right, so right now
your charges are Assault One

07:31.300 --> 07:33.067
for trying to run over
the deputy in the field there,

07:33.067 --> 07:35.700
and felony elude.
-I didn't do this!
I'm being honest.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.133
-Sit tight.
-(door closes)

07:40.367 --> 07:43.067
-Officer: I've been with
the police officers
here in Austin 25 years.

07:43.100 --> 07:46.100
I've come to learn that
as long as I've been here,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.933
I know I helped a lot of people
that needed the assistance

07:48.967 --> 07:51.233
that they couldn't have gotten
from anybody else.

07:51.267 --> 07:53.633
In that sense, it's been
very satisfying for me.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.900
Okay, I'm gonna initiate
a traffic stop on this
vehicle.

07:56.933 --> 08:00.500
It, uh... It's obvious that
it's been involved in a crash.

08:00.533 --> 08:02.300
I got him lit up.

08:03.633 --> 08:04.900
-(plastic crunches)

08:04.933 --> 08:07.633
-Henry, 4-5,
I got a black Chevrolet pickup,

08:07.667 --> 08:10.067
looked like he might have
hit a vehicle down the street.

08:10.067 --> 08:12.600
There's pieces falling off
the front end, so...

08:12.633 --> 08:15.733
we're gonna try to stop
this vehicle before it

08:15.767 --> 08:18.433
creates any more damage
out here on the street.

08:18.467 --> 08:20.333
-(radio chatter)

08:22.700 --> 08:24.700
-GPS: Your incident
has been updated.

08:24.733 --> 08:26.233
-Stop your vehicle!

08:26.267 --> 08:27.733
-I am.

08:27.767 --> 08:29.233
-GPS: Your incident
has been updated.

08:29.267 --> 08:31.233
-There's a lot of traffic, sir.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.933
-We got us a problem here,
all right?

08:35.967 --> 08:37.567
You know you
hit something, right?
-Yes, I do.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.333
-What did you hit back there
and where?

08:39.367 --> 08:41.067
-Uh...
-(sirens wail)

08:41.067 --> 08:45.067
They basically braked on me
and I had to brake behind them.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.800
-Who braked on you?

08:46.833 --> 08:49.267
-Whoever... braked on me.
-(kids crying)

08:49.300 --> 08:51.067
-They went away.
-Turn the car off.

08:51.067 --> 08:53.100
-Can I call my dad?
I need to call him.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.600
-Okay.
-He'll fix it.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.867
I'm dropping his car off
to his house, my car is there.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.467
On Airport. And then he'll
drive me back home.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.833
-Okay, because
you're coming down Burton.

09:02.867 --> 09:06.367
-Yeah, 'cause I had to pick up
some Pampers from
my dad's house.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.267
Their grandpa,
he had some Pampers for me.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.767
So that's where I was
coming from.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.200
-Okay.
-I was gonna drop his car off

09:13.233 --> 09:14.867
and then he was gonna
drive me home...
-Okay.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.233
-...in my car. My car is
at his house.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.200
-And you said this is not
your truck, right?

09:19.233 --> 09:21.467
-No, it's his truck.
-Okay, all right.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.867
Just give me a minute here.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.933
-Man on radio:
She hit a Capital Metro bus.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.533
I just submitted her front plate
as evidence.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.867
-That's a 10-4.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.367
-Apparently, she hit
a Capital Metro bus

09:31.400 --> 09:33.900
and apparently took
the side out of it.

09:33.933 --> 09:36.167
This vehicle has got complete
front end damage.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.400
Seems like non-drivable,
but it was driving.

09:38.433 --> 09:41.767
And also, we have two
small children in the vehicle.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.967
-Having a hard time
with your seatbelt?
-Yeah.

09:44.067 --> 09:46.467
-How'd you put it on?
-No, I had double-wrapped it.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.067
-Why would you
double-wrap a seatbelt?

09:48.067 --> 09:49.567
-So I'm going to jail tonight?

09:49.600 --> 09:51.667
I gotta call my dad
to pick up my car.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.600
-Okay. I don't think
the vehicle's gonna
go any further.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.933
And we got EMS checking on
the two children

09:56.967 --> 09:59.500
because of the extent of
damage on that vehicle.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.600
I'm not sure whether she was
drinking alcohol or not,

10:01.633 --> 10:04.167
so we're gonna find out
what all we got.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.733
We're not getting any indicators
that she was consuming alcohol,
but...

10:10.767 --> 10:15.200
it's obvious she has a lot
of marijuana residue
in the vehicle.

10:16.567 --> 10:18.900
-There's two bags
of marijuana in the diaper bag.

10:18.933 --> 10:20.333
-The diaper bag, out of
all things.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.600
-Yep.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.600
-Let me ask you, did you
take any drugs today at all?

10:23.633 --> 10:25.233
-No.
-Be honest with me.

10:25.267 --> 10:27.600
-No, I'm gonna be honest.
I smoked a blunt earlier today.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.300
Yeah, I'm gonna
be honest.

10:29.333 --> 10:30.533
-How earlier was that?

10:30.567 --> 10:32.967
-Hmm... Maybe about
9:30, before I went
to work.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.033
-9:30, what? A.M, P.M.?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.567
-A.M.
-Okay.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.933
-And we've got someone,
I hope, coming for
the children.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.567
-My dad.
-Your dad?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.733
-Sir, how you doing?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.533
-I was trying to locate her.

10:44.567 --> 10:46.500
-I want you to see
the front end of
the vehicle.

10:46.533 --> 10:47.800
This is how she
was driving.

10:47.833 --> 10:50.067
And she's got two children
in the back.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.500
You see what I'm saying?

10:51.533 --> 10:54.433
This is how she's
driving the vehicle.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.033
And I'm trying
to pull her over.

10:56.067 --> 10:57.700
Okay?

10:57.733 --> 11:00.633
And of course, she's got
marijuana in the diaper bag,

11:00.667 --> 11:02.333
she's got marijuana
in the console.

11:02.367 --> 11:06.133
We do know that she
was involved in two separate
leaving-the-scene accidents.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.767
She hit a Cap. Metro bus.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.900
She flips them off
and just drives away.

11:09.933 --> 11:13.400
And she hit three
additional vehicles that are
on Burton.

11:13.433 --> 11:16.133
Just so you know.
Okay?

11:16.167 --> 11:18.467
-Just when she went
to rehab. I'm always
on her, man.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.600
-Yes, Dad. I never listen
to you, always is the hard way.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.167
You know, I pay
my bills, so...

11:23.200 --> 11:25.100
-How many bills
will you be paying now?

11:25.133 --> 11:26.967
-Oh, they're gonna
be paid now.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.267
If you don't want
to help me, somebody
else will help me.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.233
-I didn't say I'm not
gonna help you, don't be
all dramatic.

11:31.267 --> 11:32.967
-You don't gotta
have to help me.
-Okay?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.767
-So I'm going to jail right now?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.300
-Okay. All right, sir,
thank you.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.133
Appreciate your cooperation.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.967
You know...
-I've raised four daughters.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.233
-That's right.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.667
-She did good, she got
her degrees, she got
an award.

11:46.700 --> 11:47.967
I was proud of her.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.733
-I don't always have
your help, Dad.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.567
You got a lot
of other stuff going on.

11:52.867 --> 11:54.533
-I'm not gonna.
-All right, sir, thank you.

11:54.567 --> 11:55.800
-All right, have
a good night.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.300
-Desiree--
-So I'm going to jail?

11:57.333 --> 11:59.100
-What?

11:59.133 --> 12:03.067
-If I can get the old man
to pay for it, then the warrant
will be tooken care of.

12:03.067 --> 12:05.500
-I understand, Desiree,
but you do understand
you're going to jail

12:05.533 --> 12:08.967
and you're being charged
with D.W.I.

12:09.067 --> 12:13.100
-But I'm not drinking.
My thingie wasn't even--

12:13.133 --> 12:16.367
-I understand. You're high
on some kind of...

12:16.400 --> 12:17.833
-Oh. Weed.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.900
-You're high on weed.
Okay, it's the same thing.

12:19.933 --> 12:21.433
The charge will be
the same.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.833
Plus, you had children.
-I got an older man

12:23.867 --> 12:25.600
that's gonna pay
all my warrants off.

12:25.633 --> 12:28.600
-Desiree--
-My last one is gonna be...

12:28.633 --> 12:32.300
My concern is my kids
can't live without me.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.433
-Okay. Well, Desiree, if they
can't live without you,

12:35.467 --> 12:41.533
why are you driving around
high on drugs,
high on marijuana?

12:41.567 --> 12:44.367
You were involved
in an accident that we know of.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.600
At 6:00, about 4 or 5 hours ago,
you hit a bus.

12:48.633 --> 12:49.900
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

12:49.933 --> 12:51.300
-You do remember that?
-Yes.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.233
-Were your children
in the car then?

12:53.267 --> 12:54.733
-No, they were at daycare.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.267
-Oh, okay. Well, luckily
they were in daycare.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.500
But they were in the vehicle
when you hit these three
other vehicles

13:00.533 --> 13:02.300
that were parked
on Burton.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.567
Now, don't worry about
your children, they're in
good hands right now. Believe.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.533
You're going to jail.
You're being charged
with D.W.I.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.600
and you're being charged
with Child Endangerment,
by the way.

13:11.633 --> 13:12.933
-I understand that.

13:12.967 --> 13:15.733
But I have a gentleman--
-Desiree, Desiree.
No, no, Desiree.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.800
-He said he'll pay it for me.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.333
-Those are-- You've got
traffic warrants.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.067
Why are you worried about
paying traffic warrants?

13:22.067 --> 13:23.267
-Those are old traffic warrants.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.067
-Okay, I'm trying to tell you
what you did today--

13:26.067 --> 13:27.900
-Yes, sir.
-And I don't think you're--
You're not--

13:27.933 --> 13:31.067
You're worried about
somebody paying off
traffic citations.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.767
-Yes.
-And you say you're worried
about your kids.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.267
-No, it's a warrant
for the theft.

13:34.300 --> 13:35.500
-Okay, well...
-Yeah.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.300
-Y-- Okay.
-Yeah, that's it.

13:38.333 --> 13:42.300
-You may want to look at
some counseling or something
'cause I think you need it.

13:45.467 --> 13:47.133
-Officer:
The one word that totally
encapsulizes

13:47.167 --> 13:49.200
what this job is to me
is honor.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.067
That is, you have to have
a certain level of honor

13:51.067 --> 13:52.533
to do this job
in the first place.

13:52.567 --> 13:54.733
But, the reason why
I do this job

13:54.767 --> 13:58.400
is to honor my little brother
who was killed as the result
of a drunk driver.

13:58.433 --> 14:01.533
To honor Deputy Jesse Valdez,
who was killed by a woman

14:01.567 --> 14:04.700
high on methamphetamine.
You know, to honor all those

14:04.733 --> 14:06.967
law enforcement officers
who have come before me,

14:07.067 --> 14:09.067
who've lost their life
doing this.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.833
All right, we got this car
ahead of us.

14:11.867 --> 14:13.400
Doesn't have
a license plate light.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.700
We're gonna make a traffic stop.

14:15.733 --> 14:17.067
Just let them know it's out.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.967
Hello, sir, Deputy Dowlearn
with the Harris County
Sheriff's Office.

14:29.067 --> 14:32.067
Hey, the reason why you're being
stopped tonight is your
license plate light is out.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.567
Okay? You got
your driver's license
and insurance on you?

14:34.600 --> 14:38.900
-I don't have my license
with me. I got a Pennsylvania
driver's license number.

14:38.933 --> 14:40.467
-Okay, you don't
have it with you?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.967
-No, sir.
-Do you have insurance on you?

14:42.067 --> 14:44.133
-Uh, she has her insurance.

14:44.167 --> 14:47.267
-He's driving me around
'cause I had an operation.

14:47.300 --> 14:50.233
-She just had an operation
so that's the only reason
why I'm driving her around.

14:50.267 --> 14:51.500
-M'kay, where y'all coming from?

14:51.533 --> 14:54.767
-I just got off work.
I work down at the Valero.

14:54.800 --> 14:59.700
And we just rode up here
by the lake and we was coming
back down here to her house.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.433
-Until we get you identified,
I wanna have you step out, okay?

15:04.067 --> 15:06.667
-I'm not honestly sure.
Like I say, I just--

15:08.067 --> 15:09.633
She come up there, pick me up,
to take me home.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.900
-Okay, something ain't
making sense about your story.

15:11.933 --> 15:13.500
You told me she just
had surgery.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.800
-Yes, sir.
-Y'all went up to the lake.

15:14.833 --> 15:16.133
What'd y'all go up
to the lake for?

15:16.167 --> 15:18.733
We just drove up by there
'cause she wants to go fishing.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.367
-Who is she to you?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.333
-She's just like, a real good
friend is all she is.

15:22.367 --> 15:23.933
-Real good friend?

15:23.967 --> 15:25.667
-I call her Mama.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.233
-All right. All right, bub,
do me a favor, keep your butt
on the push bumper.

15:28.267 --> 15:31.967
Okay? I'm gonna go
talk to her.
-Okay.

15:32.067 --> 15:34.300
-All right, keeping
your voice down, what are
y'all doing out here?

15:34.333 --> 15:37.867
-I picked him up
at Valero. He works there.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.533
Then he had a car door.

15:39.567 --> 15:44.600
(mumbles indistinctly)

15:44.633 --> 15:46.767
-All right, why is he telling me
y'all are coming from the lake?

15:46.800 --> 15:50.533
-We rode down to the lake.
Turned around and come back.
-Why?

15:50.567 --> 15:54.567
-I asked him to take a ride
by the lake 'cause I slept
all afternoon.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.167
I ain't tired.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.267
-M'kay. Let me just make sure
you ain't got no guns on you,
okay?

15:58.300 --> 15:59.600
No weapons.

15:59.633 --> 16:02.500
All right, you stay right here,
okay? Don't go anywhere.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.933
What's your name.
-Janet. Alma.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.233
-Alma, or Janet?

16:10.267 --> 16:11.700
-Janet.
-Janet?

16:11.733 --> 16:12.967
-J-A-N-E-T.
-Okay.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.333
Janet?
-Yeah.

16:14.367 --> 16:15.900
When's the last time
weed was in this car?

16:15.933 --> 16:18.333
-Last what? What?
-Last time you had
weed in this car?

16:18.367 --> 16:20.400
-Weed?
-Yeah, I'm seeing--

16:20.433 --> 16:21.700
-I don't smoke weed.

16:21.733 --> 16:23.067
-Well, somebody
had weed in your car

16:23.100 --> 16:24.667
because there's crumbs of it
in the door handle.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.900
-Wasn't me. Maybe him,
but wasn't me.

16:25.933 --> 16:27.933
-Okay.
-Wasn't me.

16:30.967 --> 16:33.233
-I'll take a drug test,
I don't do weed.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.767
Tell you what,
go ahead and place your hands
behind your back.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.133
You're gonna be detained
right now.

16:37.167 --> 16:38.967
Just because there's two
of y'all and one of me. Okay?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.400
-Wasn't my weed.
-Go ahead and turn around,

16:42.433 --> 16:44.900
place your hands
behind your back. You're being
detained at this time, okay?

16:44.933 --> 16:48.100
Because I'm finding
marijuana residue in the car.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.933
-I do not do marijuana, sir.

16:51.767 --> 16:53.267
-Okay.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.533
-Now, besides that,
am I gonna find
anything else?

16:56.567 --> 16:59.100
-Shay Shay leave a pipe
or anything in there?

16:59.133 --> 17:02.467
-There we go. What kind of pipe
would she have left
in there?

17:02.500 --> 17:03.667
-Probably a crack pipe.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.200
-Crack pipe.
Where would it be?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.200
-Shay Shay ain't been
in that car since yesterday.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.367
-Where would it be
if there was?

17:09.400 --> 17:12.067
-If it was, it would probably
be under the seat.

17:12.067 --> 17:14.267
-You saying it was
her crack pipe?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.467
-Yes, sir.
-Are you a dishwasher
at Valero?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.833
-Yes, sir. I am.
-You are? Is that why
you have the Brillo?

17:18.867 --> 17:21.267
-Yes, sir.
-You know I'm being
facetious, right?

17:21.300 --> 17:23.900
-I know, because they use
that for crack pipes.

17:23.933 --> 17:26.567
-That's right. That's-- M'kay.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.067
All right, y'all hang tight.
Don't go anywhere.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.600
Yeah. Here we go.

17:33.633 --> 17:35.367
And it looks like
there's gonna be

17:35.400 --> 17:37.667
a lot of residue
on the inside of it.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.167
And it's gonna be
a good little trace case for us.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.467
-What's going on?

17:42.500 --> 17:44.633
-Hey, Sarge, I pulled this car
over on a tag light.

17:44.667 --> 17:48.400
-He doesn't have an I.D.
with him, so I asked some stuff
so I could get him I.D.'ed.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.967
-Their stories didn't match.
He says he works at the Valero.

17:51.067 --> 17:53.167
She's saying that she
picked him up from
the Valero.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.800
He's saying that they came
from the lake.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.400
-She's saying they're just
riding around.

17:57.433 --> 18:00.067
I asked if there was
anything illegal in the car,

18:00.067 --> 18:01.767
or would be anything illegal.

18:01.800 --> 18:06.300
He's claiming that Shay Shay
may have left a crack pipe
under the seat.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.867
Um, guess where I found that?

18:08.900 --> 18:10.433
-I don't think Shay Shay did it.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.067
-Shay Shay. So...

18:12.067 --> 18:14.233
So you don't think
Shay Shay left this?

18:14.267 --> 18:15.900
-No, sir.
-So do you think
he left it?

18:15.933 --> 18:18.333
-Yep.

18:18.367 --> 18:20.733
-In Harris County,
if they're caught with
any amount,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.500
no matter if it's
residual,

18:22.533 --> 18:24.167
what people would call
residual amounts,

18:24.200 --> 18:26.067
they can actually
be charged with it.

18:26.067 --> 18:29.233
So what we're gonna do now
is we're gonna test the inside
of the pipe

18:29.267 --> 18:34.067
by swabbing the inside
and using a cocaine test kit.

18:34.067 --> 18:37.200
All right, you're in care,
custody, and control
of that crack pipe.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.733
Okay? You were sitting
above it.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.500
Any residue
of controlled substance
such as cocaine,

18:41.533 --> 18:45.767
or methamphetamine,
if I can test it and it tests
positive for it,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.433
you can be charged
for possession.

18:47.467 --> 18:49.067
-Okay.
-Okay?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.500
So I'm looking for
a flash of blue.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.567
Okay.
See that blue color, Jimmy?

18:56.600 --> 18:59.200
-Mm-hmm.
-That's a positive test
for cocaine. Okay?

19:00.700 --> 19:02.633
All right, walk that way.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.267
Pat him down more thoroughly.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.500
Okay.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.833
All right, ma'am,
I'm gonna let you go.

19:13.867 --> 19:16.867
Appreciate your
cooperation, okay?

19:16.900 --> 19:19.400
You understand that you
easily could have been
charged with that?

19:19.433 --> 19:21.733
-I know.
-This is your car, right?

19:21.767 --> 19:24.567
You need to think about
who you're letting
in your vehicle.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.833
Because this could have went
a totally different way.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.400
You could have been
the one in the handcuffs.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.133
-Can you make sure my car's
gonna start?

19:31.167 --> 19:32.967
-Yeah, go ahead and try
to start it up.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.167
-(mumbling)

19:39.433 --> 19:41.067
-(engine sputters, clicks)

19:41.100 --> 19:43.367
-He left the damn lights on.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.367
-All right, I got
jumper cables.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.900
Suspect one minute,
distressed motorist the next.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.600
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.567
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.733
Cover is code three.

19:55.767 --> 19:58.733
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.933 --> 20:07.433
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.633
-(theme music playing)
