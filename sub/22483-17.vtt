-Hmm.

00:11.667 --> 00:12.917

00:32.000 --> 00:34.041
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?

00:34.125 --> 00:36.917
The days are gone where you can

00:34.125 --> 00:36.917

00:43.709 --> 00:44.917

-Huh.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.834
-Yeah. Make yourself

01:02.917 --> 01:04.834
Nice try.

01:04.917 --> 01:08.834
Wow, there are so many

01:08.917 --> 01:11.625
I mean, this must be what

01:08.917 --> 01:11.625
online dating is like.

01:11.709 --> 01:13.542
Yeah, and we really missed

01:11.709 --> 01:13.542
the boat on that one.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.083
I can see why it's

01:13.625 --> 01:15.083
so addictive, though.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.208
It's like shoe shopping,

01:15.166 --> 01:17.208
but for people.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.917
First things first--

01:17.291 --> 01:19.917
we need to create a profile.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.041
-Oh, okay.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.041
-All right?

01:21.125 --> 01:23.166
-So let's take a profile pic.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.166
-Oh, fun.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.500
-Oh, people like laughter. So...

01:23.250 --> 01:25.500
-Oh, that's great,

01:25.583 --> 01:26.959
because I got

01:25.583 --> 01:26.959
a really funny joke.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.500
-No, fake laughter's fine.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.500
Ready?

01:27.041 --> 01:28.500
-Okay.

01:28.583 --> 01:30.208
One, two, three.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.417
(camera clicks)

01:32.500 --> 01:34.750
Oh, no. Greg, that's terrible.

01:34.834 --> 01:37.625
-It looks like a ransom photo,

01:34.834 --> 01:37.625
and you're holding me hostage.

01:34.834 --> 01:37.625
-Mm.

01:37.709 --> 01:39.458
Let's just use

01:37.709 --> 01:39.458
our wedding photo.

01:39.542 --> 01:41.750
Good idea. I will Photoshop

01:39.542 --> 01:41.750
in my missing tooth.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.000
Yeah.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.125

01:47.208 --> 01:49.959
(gasps) Are you checking?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.959
No one likes us, do they?

01:50.041 --> 01:52.625
I knew my eyebrows were

01:50.041 --> 01:52.625
too thin on our wedding day.

01:52.709 --> 01:54.709
-Six matches, babe.

01:52.709 --> 01:54.709
-No way.

01:56.291 --> 01:58.208

01:56.291 --> 01:58.208
-Uh-huh?

01:58.291 --> 02:01.542
Kelly. She thinks mean people

01:58.291 --> 02:01.542
suck, and she loves pizza.

02:01.625 --> 02:03.542
Okay, Greg,
but we're looking for a sitter,

02:03.625 --> 02:05.834
not, like, a 13-year-old
best friend.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.709
Okay. How about Kelli
with an "I"?

02:07.792 --> 02:10.166
She "don't need no drama,"
and neither do we.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.500
You know what,
that's a lot of all caps.

02:12.583 --> 02:16.000
And too many exclamation points.
It might be a coke thing.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.166
Yeah, that's a good catch.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.250
(gasps) Greg. Look.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.333
Jordana.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.834
-She's...
-(heavenly choir sings)

02:24.917 --> 02:27.250
The one.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.417
-(choir stops)
-Ugh, I hate pop-up ads.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.083
JEN:
<i>Her name is Jordana,</i>

02:31.166 --> 02:33.542
she's in law school,
<i>and </i>she was a counselor

02:33.625 --> 02:35.291
at Camp Running Wolf.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.458
Oh. Well, she sounds
just like you.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.208
I know. Isn't it the best?

02:39.291 --> 02:42.250
Also, she speaks two languages,
English and restaurant Spanish.

02:42.333 --> 02:44.875
-Mmm.
-When does she start?

02:42.333 --> 02:44.875
In either language.

02:44.959 --> 02:46.333
Well, we haven't met her yet.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.250
Or, um, really heard back
from her.

02:49.333 --> 02:50.917
But I have a very good
feeling about it.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.625
Me, too. In fact, I e-mailed
her a joke last night

02:53.709 --> 02:55.959
when I couldn't sleep,
so the bonding's already begun.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.792
I'm sorry, what?
You sent her <i>another </i>message?

02:58.875 --> 03:00.583
Well, actually,
it was two e-mails.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.583
The first e-mail was the setup,

03:02.667 --> 03:04.875
and then the second e-mail
was the punch line.

03:04.959 --> 03:06.792
Greg, why would you do that?

03:06.875 --> 03:09.125
-Do you know how desperate
that looks?

03:06.875 --> 03:09.125
-I know.

03:09.208 --> 03:12.083
So I sent another e-mail saying,
"We are not desperate."

03:12.166 --> 03:13.709
-No.
-But if I'm being honest,

03:13.792 --> 03:15.625
<i>-that </i>felt a little
bit desperate.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.625
-Yeah.

03:15.709 --> 03:16.750
So then I sent an e-mail

03:16.834 --> 03:19.417
-that said,
"JK. Ha-ha-ha. LOL."

03:16.834 --> 03:19.417
-No.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.750
Even though that technically
means the same thing.

03:21.834 --> 03:25.041
Greg, you blew this.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.667
I didn't blow anything,
all right?

03:26.750 --> 03:28.917
But, look, if you feel
so strongly about it,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.959
-let me fix it.
-Oh! Get...

03:31.041 --> 03:32.041
-(phone chimes)
-What? No. Here we...

03:32.125 --> 03:33.250
-Wait. Oh, look.
-What?

03:33.333 --> 03:34.542
-It's her.
-(gasps)

03:34.625 --> 03:36.083
She wants to meet!

03:36.166 --> 03:37.375
-(screams)
-Yes!

03:37.458 --> 03:38.875
Oh, my God!
Honey, you did it.

03:38.959 --> 03:41.000
-I love you so much.
-Oh, I love you.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.500
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, my God,

03:41.083 --> 03:43.500
you don't have to be sorry.

03:43.583 --> 03:47.458
What a... what a head
on this guy, what a brain, huh?

03:47.542 --> 03:49.875
Hey, you want to do some
fight kissing of our own?

03:49.959 --> 03:52.083
-Come on, say something nasty.
-Oh, Tim, shut up.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.834
That's so stupid.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.208
Oh. Nice.

-Hey.

I'm a little bit messy.

He makes my daughter very happy.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.917
You know, I'm sorry,
I am blanking right now.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.417
Which one is Samantha?

07:11.667 --> 07:13.542
Sorry, "w-which one"?

07:13.625 --> 07:15.667
Oh, well, you know how
it gets with these kids.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.875
Everybody is dating
everybody nowadays.

07:17.959 --> 07:21.125
-Huh.
-Isn't it so nasty,

07:17.959 --> 07:21.125
but kind of fun?

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
Ryan is juggling so many girls.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.750
His mom didn't even
know which one Sam was.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.458
She thought Sam had black hair,

07:28.542 --> 07:30.166
with a bunch
of eyebrow piercings.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.125
Which says a lot
about Ryan's taste.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.166
That's a whole
other conversation.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.250
Maybe Sam already knows
about the piercing girls.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.709
You know,
kids are different today.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.709
They're all "low-key,"
and "on the Kinsey scale,"

07:39.792 --> 07:41.250
and "turnt."

07:41.333 --> 07:42.792
Come on, we both know
Sam's not that cool.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.291
There is no way
she knows about this,

07:44.375 --> 07:46.125
and I'm gonna tell her.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.291
Let's just make sure we get
all the facts before we risk

07:48.375 --> 07:49.875
ruining our relationship
with her,

07:49.959 --> 07:51.625
which is actually
pretty good right now.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.166
I mean, she hasn't
called you "bitch"

07:53.250 --> 07:55.041
under her breath in a long time.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.083
Fine. But when we are positive,

07:57.166 --> 08:00.125
I get to say that he is
a frickin' piece of crap,

08:00.208 --> 08:02.750
and doesn't deserve to be
a part of this family.

08:02.834 --> 08:06.709
Aw, that was your dad's toast
at our wedding.

08:07.792 --> 08:09.500
You know,

08:09.583 --> 08:13.625
a patient of mine was telling me
about their open marriage.

08:13.709 --> 08:15.417
So what do you guys
think about that?

08:15.500 --> 08:16.458
Sam, why don't you go first?

08:16.542 --> 08:18.083
I don't care.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.458
You don't care
about my cousin's open marriage.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.041
Patient, babe.
It's your patient.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.625
Right, my pa...
Yeah, patient, too.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.375
Yeah, every-everyone's doing it.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.625
Is that what everybody's doing,
Sam? Open?

08:27.709 --> 08:29.667
If you're asking
if I'm okay with you guys

08:29.750 --> 08:31.667
having an open relationship,
I don't care.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.750
Just make sure it's not
with any of my teachers.

08:33.834 --> 08:38.417
Okay, well, uh,
why don't you call Ryan

08:38.500 --> 08:40.208
and see what he thinks
about it, 'cause,

08:40.291 --> 08:41.917
you know, he's super smart.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.875
No! Leave me alone
and get back to your threesome!

08:44.959 --> 08:46.750
(chuckles)
What am I worried about?

08:46.834 --> 08:49.917
You guys are so gross, nobody's
gonna want to be with you.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.125
Okay, bye, honey. Bye.

08:54.959 --> 08:58.834
(crying):
Mom! The worst thing ever

08:54.959 --> 08:58.834
just happened. It's Ryan.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.709
Oh, no. Did you,
did you find something out?

09:00.792 --> 09:02.792
Yes. He broke his leg
at a wrestling match.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.125
You have to take me
to the hospital to see him.

09:05.208 --> 09:08.125
Okay, are you sure
he actually broke his leg?

09:08.208 --> 09:11.333
Because these guys will use
just the craziest excuses.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.875
What kind of a question is that?

09:12.959 --> 09:15.834
The literal love of my life
is fully dying right now,

09:15.917 --> 09:17.417
and if you don't take me
to see him,

09:17.500 --> 09:19.917
-you're the actual devil.
-Oh.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.500
Uh-oh. I think I just
heard her say...

09:22.583 --> 09:25.166
-(whispers): "bitch."
-Yeah. I heard her.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.417
If you're here to see Ryan,
don't bother.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.750
Apparently, he's got

09:31.834 --> 09:33.500
all the girlfriends he needs.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.750
But I'm Ryan's girlfriend.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.166
Yeah, there's, like, five of us.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.625
Typical male stuff.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.125
We're gonna organize a march
if you're interested.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.709
Oh, hi!

09:43.792 --> 09:46.041
How sweet of you to come.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.166
So this is <i>your </i>mom?

09:47.250 --> 09:49.250
When we ran into each other
the other day,

09:49.333 --> 09:50.542
we were trying to figure out
which one

09:50.625 --> 09:53.125
-of Ryan's girlfriends you were.
-What?

09:53.208 --> 09:54.583
Well, you know,
you should go and see him

09:54.667 --> 09:56.083
once that big one leaves.

09:57.959 --> 10:00.458
You knew this whole time that
Ryan was seeing other girls?

10:00.542 --> 10:02.000
Yes, but I...

10:02.083 --> 10:03.583
Why didn't you tell me?
You're my mom!

10:03.667 --> 10:05.792
We're supposed to talk
about everything.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.542
(groans)

10:08.625 --> 10:09.917
(knocking)

10:10.000 --> 10:11.792
SAMANTHA:
I said leave me alone!

10:11.875 --> 10:13.792
You can do so much better, okay?

10:13.875 --> 10:15.875
Because you are, like, a ten,

10:15.959 --> 10:19.041
and he's a zero. Not that
I think rating women is okay.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.834
Yeah, I hope that turd gets
maimed in a wrestling accident

10:21.917 --> 10:23.875
and has to live
the whole rest of his life

10:23.959 --> 10:26.458
with a plastic wiener
that's computer-controlled

10:26.542 --> 10:30.083
and it malfunctions in business
meetings and embarrasses him!

10:30.166 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, that!

10:32.083 --> 10:35.542
How could you talk about him
like that? That's my boyfriend.

10:35.625 --> 10:38.625
Really? You're okay with him
having all these girlfriends?

10:38.709 --> 10:40.709
No. I told him he had
to choose, and he chose me.

10:40.792 --> 10:41.750
Oh.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.500
It was so romantic.

10:43.583 --> 10:46.500
But I guess you wouldn't
understand, since you hate love!

10:46.583 --> 10:47.834
No.

10:47.917 --> 10:49.250
Let's never talk to her again.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.875
Okay.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.125
(laughing)

10:58.208 --> 11:00.542
I can't believe you spent
ten years in Brazil.

11:00.625 --> 11:02.125
Was it romantic?

11:02.208 --> 11:03.291
(speaks Portuguese)

11:03.375 --> 11:05.250
That means "very romantic"
in Portuguese.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.625
-Fancy!
-Yeah!

11:06.709 --> 11:09.291
I got dumped
by so many hot guys.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.125
-Oh, that sounds amazing.
-Oh, so fun.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.250
My half-sister
is such an adventurer.

11:13.333 --> 11:16.542
Mm. Speaking of adventures,
how's the baby-making?

11:16.625 --> 11:19.375
Um, not great, actually.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.375
Uh, we did IVF, and we got
a couple of viable embryos,

11:21.458 --> 11:23.375
but my doctor's worried I'm not
gonna be able to carry them,

11:23.458 --> 11:25.208
so... I don't know.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.959
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

11:27.041 --> 11:30.166
Oh, it's just another roadblock
in a relationship full of them.

11:30.250 --> 11:33.208
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm so sorry that I'm late. Hi.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.083
-Hi-ee!
-Hi-ee!

11:35.166 --> 11:37.166
-Oh, so that's genetic.
-(laughing)

11:37.250 --> 11:38.959
-It's so nice to meet you, Rita.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

11:39.041 --> 11:40.417
-Hey.
-Hi. Oh, we do two.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.125
-Mwah, mwah.
-Oh. Mwah, mwah.

11:42.208 --> 11:43.709
-(speaks Portuguese)
-(chuckles)

11:43.792 --> 11:47.291
This is gonna sound so crazy.
Have we met before?

11:47.375 --> 11:49.583
-No, I don't...
I don't think so. No, right?

11:47.375 --> 11:49.583
-Oh, no. No.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.750
No?

11:51.834 --> 11:53.792
I had sex with Colleen's sister.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.458
-(snorts)
-Noice.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.375
Just when I think you
can't get any cooler, you go

11:58.458 --> 12:01.709
and have sex with one of your
wife's family members. Man!

12:01.792 --> 12:03.709
No, man,
I didn't cheat on Colleen.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.875
It was a one-night stand
12 years ago in Cancún.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.208
Greg was there.

12:07.291 --> 12:10.375
Spring break!
Errybody got some on that trip.

12:10.458 --> 12:13.458
I met this one <i>chica</i>
at the Cancún Public Library.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.792
I was checking out <i>Harry Potter</i>
<i>and the Goblet of Fire,</i>

12:15.875 --> 12:17.667
but <i>she </i>checked me out.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.333
The library in Cancún?

12:19.417 --> 12:21.166
Yeah, but there they call it
a <i>biblioteca.</i>

12:21.250 --> 12:22.583
And I biblio-took-a
her virginity,

12:22.667 --> 12:23.917
if you know what I mean.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.333
So you gonna tell Colleen
or can I?

12:26.417 --> 12:28.166
No, I have to. "Can I"?

12:28.250 --> 12:30.583
What the hell's
the matter with you?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.875
You... passed the test.

12:35.917 --> 12:38.125
-Colleen?
-Matt.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.375
-Hey, honey.
Uh, we have to talk.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.375
-Hey.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.542
Okay, but first,
I have really good news.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.834
-Mm-hmm.
-Rita wants to be our surrogate.

12:44.917 --> 12:45.875
What?

12:45.959 --> 12:47.959
I'm gonna carry your baby.
(laughs)

12:48.041 --> 12:49.583
Wha... No.

12:49.667 --> 12:52.458
Oh, honey, look, I want this
more than anything,

12:52.542 --> 12:54.291
but Rita cannot be
our surrogate.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.083
-Why not?
-Why?

12:56.166 --> 12:58.709
Uh, I don't really know
how to say this, but...

12:58.792 --> 13:00.375
Rita and I had sex.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.208
What? I will kill you!

13:02.291 --> 13:03.250
No, we didn't.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.125
Yes, we did.
12 years ago in Cancún.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.041
No, we definitely didn't have
sex. Colleen, I swear.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.041
-I keep Polaroids--
I would know.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.041
-MATT: I'm so sorry.

13:09.125 --> 13:13.041
Look, I wish that I could take
back that sweaty, drunken night

13:13.125 --> 13:15.125
in the bathroom at Señor Frog's.

13:15.208 --> 13:16.417
-Ew.
-Ew.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.417
What, you don't remember?
I had the frosted tips

13:18.500 --> 13:20.834
and the awesome blond goatee.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.083
-Ew!
-Ew!

13:22.166 --> 13:24.667
You... <i>you </i>have a...

13:24.750 --> 13:27.750
a tattoo of a dolphin riding
a surfboard on your left wrist!

13:27.834 --> 13:30.583
No, I don't. My boyfriend
in high school was Jewish.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.583
Joshy, remember? And I want
to be buried next to him.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.000
-What?
-Matt,

13:35.083 --> 13:37.208
what are you doing?
We've had enough problems,

13:37.291 --> 13:39.792
and now you're just,
like, inventing them.

13:42.709 --> 13:43.917
MATT:
<i>All right, uh,</i>

13:44.000 --> 13:45.458
we'll fill 'em in when
they get here. Okay.

13:45.542 --> 13:46.709
Uh, okay,

13:46.792 --> 13:49.083
we are thrilled to announce

13:49.166 --> 13:51.792
Rita has agreed
to be our surrogate.

13:51.875 --> 13:55.458
-(gasping)
-Oh, my goodness, honey!

13:55.542 --> 13:58.625
Congratulations! Oh!

13:58.709 --> 14:02.250
So, is she the bun or the oven?

14:02.333 --> 14:04.792
Just tell me which one
is gonna get big.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.792
-(glass clinking)
-TIM: Toast! Toast!

14:06.875 --> 14:10.500
As the future godfather,
I would like to say a few words.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.583
MATT:
We're not doing godparents,

14:10.583 --> 14:11.583
but you know what,

14:11.667 --> 14:14.542
go right ahead, man.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.709
Thank you for letting
me be the godfather.

14:16.792 --> 14:18.375
This is a great honor.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.333
That's all I prepared.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.917
-Oh, it was great!
-Okay, very nice.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.375
Hey, sorry we're late.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.125
Oh, no. Did we miss
the big announcement?

14:25.208 --> 14:26.500
Yeah. Um, so...

14:26.583 --> 14:28.667
Oh, Snape!

14:28.750 --> 14:30.208
Severus?

14:30.291 --> 14:31.959
-Severus?
-(laughs)

14:32.041 --> 14:36.834
No one's called you that
since we... Oh, no.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.542
Well, we met
at the Cancún Public Library

14:39.625 --> 14:41.250
and spent the night together.

14:41.333 --> 14:44.417
And I said Harry Potter
could never get you laid.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.250
-What a terrible way
to be proven wrong.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.250
-Mm.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.166
How did the space training go?

14:49.250 --> 14:50.208
The wha... Ah.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.250
Good. Very good.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.500
I am a professional
astronaut now.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.125
Right, everyone?

14:57.208 --> 14:58.542
Well, I honestly don't know

14:58.625 --> 15:01.583
what any of my kids do,
so it's possible.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.834
So what if she slept
with Greg once?

15:03.917 --> 15:05.959
-Thrice.
-Three times, hard.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.166
-Huh.
-Noice.

15:07.250 --> 15:08.500
Wow, wow, wow.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.834
This is fun for me. (laughs)

15:10.917 --> 15:13.375
But I think we have
to go now. Right, honey?

15:13.458 --> 15:17.625
Because Greg is leaving
for the space station tomorrow,

15:17.709 --> 15:20.917
and you all know how much
I cherish his time on Earth.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.709
There's a lot of love
for Greg in this room.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.542
Thanks, Mom. That's
the reception I was hoping for

15:25.625 --> 15:27.875
when I made the biggest
announcement of our lives.

15:27.959 --> 15:30.542
She can, she can still
be our surrogate, right?

15:30.625 --> 15:32.083
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-(cheers)

15:32.166 --> 15:33.208
I mean, it's not weird that,
you know,

15:33.291 --> 15:34.333
somebody that Greg
slept with three times

15:34.417 --> 15:35.458
is gonna give birth
to our child.

15:35.542 --> 15:36.500
That's not gonna haunt
my dreams.

15:36.583 --> 15:37.542
No.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.667
Actually, it was four times.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.041
-Four.
-How do you say "four"

15:42.125 --> 15:44.709
like "thrice"? "Frice"?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.417
That's a head-scratcher, hey.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.125
All right, bye-bye then.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.583
Honey, I don't think you're
supposed to actually do

15:58.667 --> 16:00.792
the bowling ball test
in the store.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.250
No, they want that.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.125
That's why they put it
in the commercials.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.709
Why don't you wait in the car
and let me handle this.

16:06.792 --> 16:09.875
Because sometimes, big
decisions-- they paralyze you.

16:09.959 --> 16:13.041
-Look, this will be quick
and painless.

16:09.959 --> 16:13.041
-Hi.

16:13.125 --> 16:16.041
-Hi. I want to see every one
of your mattresses.

16:13.125 --> 16:16.041
-Oh.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.500
Let's show you around.
You know, we actually have

16:17.583 --> 16:19.417
a rack for bowling balls.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.375
Oh. Eh, do you have
a corkscrew?

16:21.458 --> 16:23.709
You know it.
I drink at work all the time.

16:25.834 --> 16:28.709
Feels like I'm sleeping
on angel balls.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.291
SALESMAN:
That makes sense.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.583
This one's actually
from our Angel Series.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.041
-Done deal.
-(salesman chuckles)

16:34.125 --> 16:36.083
Yeah, put this
in the "maybe" pile.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.208
Another one
for the "maybe" pile.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.667
What do you think?

16:42.750 --> 16:44.208
It's perfect.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.959
A little too perfect.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.583
How can a mattress
be too perfect?

16:48.667 --> 16:50.750
That's what I'm wondering,
Joanie.

16:50.834 --> 16:52.667
Please, John, just choose one.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.041
Look, maybe you're ready
to commit

16:54.125 --> 16:55.875
to the first one
that makes you feel good.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.333
You know,
gets your rocks off.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.041
Me? I'm a romantic.

16:59.125 --> 17:02.709
-I'm looking for "the one."
-Oh.

17:02.792 --> 17:05.000
Dig deep, Dusty. Are you sure

17:05.083 --> 17:06.667
you've shown us every mattress?

17:06.750 --> 17:08.750
There's one mattress
the employees use

17:08.834 --> 17:10.333
for naps and quickies.

17:10.417 --> 17:11.875
(water sloshing)

17:11.959 --> 17:14.375
Oh, John.
I will even sleep on this.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.375
Just choose.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.500
Don't rush me.

17:18.583 --> 17:22.000
Just let me take it for a spin.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.041
No.

17:25.125 --> 17:28.291
No. Let's go try that first bed
we looked at again.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.375
Joanie?

17:30.458 --> 17:32.625
JOAN:
<i>I haven't slept in a while</i>

17:32.709 --> 17:34.500
because we need a new bed,

17:34.583 --> 17:36.959
and your father refuses
to make a decision.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.375
I'm a perfectionist.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.500
Is that why you're wearing
two different shoes?

17:40.583 --> 17:42.458
-Hmm?
-You know what you should do?

17:42.542 --> 17:44.417
You should, uh,
get a bed online.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.834
I'm not gonna stand on line
for a bed.

17:46.917 --> 17:48.750
What is this, the depression?

17:48.834 --> 17:51.750
No, we did it. Yeah, it's really
easy. You just go online,

17:51.834 --> 17:53.625
you put in your measurements
and your sleep habits.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.083
Yeah. For instance,
I learned that Greg sleeps

17:56.166 --> 18:00.083
in a position experts like
to call "the full-grown fetus."

18:00.166 --> 18:03.417
Well, John,
let's get the Internet bed.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.500
It's perfect
because the computer

18:05.583 --> 18:07.125
makes the decision for you.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.458
Yeah, maybe.
We'll-we'll come over tonight

18:09.542 --> 18:11.166
-and give her a test drive.
-(Joan sighs)

18:11.250 --> 18:13.625
Sorry, w-what do you mean
by test drive?

18:13.709 --> 18:16.166
Well, I like to give a bed
a run for its money.

18:16.250 --> 18:19.208
You know, lie down, roll around,
get on all fours.

18:19.291 --> 18:22.500
Make sure it can handle
all my moves.

18:23.917 --> 18:26.625
All right, let's see what
we're working with here.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.250
-Wha...?
-Whoa, Dad. What are you doing?

18:30.333 --> 18:31.750
This is how I sleep at home.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.709
T-shirt, no pants.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.458
Winnie the Pooh style.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.166
Uh, hate to break it
to you, Pooh Bear,

18:37.250 --> 18:39.291
but this is a "pants on"
type of party.

18:39.375 --> 18:41.458
Jen, who gave you
this comforter?

18:41.542 --> 18:42.834
Uh, I picked it out.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.542
Oh, why?

18:44.625 --> 18:46.583
I think that's
a rhetorical question, right?

18:46.667 --> 18:47.834
Probably.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.250
Oh. I love this.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.250
Come on, John. Let's go home

18:52.333 --> 18:53.458
and get started.

18:53.542 --> 18:55.542
You know, we've got to get
a mattress soon,

18:55.625 --> 18:59.417
or I might lose my plucky,
upbeat demeanor.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.709
(chuckles)

19:00.792 --> 19:02.083
John, move!

19:02.166 --> 19:03.125
Uh, all right.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.291
Smells like ass in here, anyway.

19:06.542 --> 19:09.291
Always fun having 'em over.

19:09.375 --> 19:12.208
JOAN:
<i>John, our mattress came</i>

19:09.375 --> 19:12.208
<i>in the mail.</i>

19:12.291 --> 19:13.834
Hmm.

19:15.208 --> 19:16.834
It's all shriveled.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.750
It reminds me of the time I had

19:18.834 --> 19:21.834
to help my grandfather get
into his swimming trunks.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.458
It'll grow once it's out
in the open.

19:24.542 --> 19:27.041
Yeah, that's what
my grandpa used to say.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.583
Oh.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.166
I'm not so sure
this is the winner, Joanie.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.208
(sighs)

19:37.291 --> 19:38.750
It smells like that old fridge

19:38.834 --> 19:41.792
I got stuck in when I was a kid.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.500
Here. I'll hold the box.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.834
You put the bed back in.

19:46.917 --> 19:48.500
No.

19:48.583 --> 19:50.291
-If this bed isn't
good enough...

19:48.583 --> 19:50.291
-Mm.

19:50.375 --> 19:51.917
...then nothing will be.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.208
You have to pick out

19:53.291 --> 19:54.917
-a new mattress today...
-Mm-hmm.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.250
...or you're sleeping
on the sofa.

19:57.333 --> 19:58.709
Geez.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.625
Maybe if you got
some more sleep,

20:00.709 --> 20:02.542
you wouldn't be such a downer.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.625
JOAN:
<i>Oh, I hope we don't get</i>

20:07.709 --> 20:09.417
that same salesman.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.709
-Mmm.
-Ugh.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.709
-(salesman laughs)

20:10.792 --> 20:12.875
Dudes! Are you kidding?

20:12.959 --> 20:14.458
I thought you might have died.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.291
My husband has made
a decision.

20:16.375 --> 20:17.583
John, tell him what you want.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.542
I want the Angel Series 2000.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.542
But I want it for a thousand.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.208
It's an $800 mattress.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.625
Deal. Thank you.

20:25.709 --> 20:27.875
-I'm so happy.
-It's a great choice.

20:27.959 --> 20:30.458
Best part is, that mattress
comes with a 30-year warranty.

20:30.542 --> 20:32.792
So it'll be the last mattress
you ever have to buy.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.417
Oh, that's great,

20:34.500 --> 20:35.834
because I never want
to go through

20:35.917 --> 20:37.625
this miserable process again.

20:37.709 --> 20:41.417
30 years. So that makes it
my deathbed, huh?

20:41.500 --> 20:43.000
Whoa, this changes everything.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.458
No.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.125
This decision is
too big to be rushed.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.583
-I should sleep on it.
-Oh, no.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.000
Where should I start?
