WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:10.385
Yeah, thanks. I just wanna confirm
that my employees' benefits won't lapse.

00:10.927 --> 00:11.886
Sure, I'll hold.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.017
You're here early.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.394
Oh, been getting here at 8 all week.

00:19.477 --> 00:22.522
Rise and grind.
What the sports guys say on Twitter.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.066
Sports guys also dress
like Justin Bieber's pastor?

00:25.150 --> 00:26.443
No, not just that.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.362
I, too, released a statement
after Bieber's monkey incident.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.282
-Insulting you is getting harder.
-Oh, thank you.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.744
So I took Eliza's advice
to embrace being the big boss.

00:35.827 --> 00:40.498
Buy, sell, flip, flop, love it, list it.
I'm not talking to anyone, I'm on hold.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.500
Speaking of Eliza, how are you feeling

00:42.584 --> 00:44.878
after everything that happened
or didn't happen?

00:44.961 --> 00:46.838
Bad. Really bad.

00:46.921 --> 00:51.217
I almost told her I liked her moments
before she got back with her husband.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.429
Nothing dropping a shot of JÃ¤ger
into a pint of ice cream won't cure.

00:54.512 --> 00:58.308
We're better off as friends.
Now we can go back to acting normal.

00:58.391 --> 01:02.937
Eliza! Looking good,
looking sharp, looking chill.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.191
In my Blockbuster uniform
that I always wear?

01:06.274 --> 01:07.609
Sure, whatever. Shut up.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.278
Timmy got here at 8.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.905
Eight a.m.?

01:11.988 --> 01:14.741
-Oh, it's not that early.
-Not for most people,

01:14.824 --> 01:17.327
but you claim
it's not worth waking up that early

01:17.410 --> 01:20.080
because your breakfast burrito place
doesn't open until 11.

01:20.163 --> 01:24.292
But your breakfast burrito place
is a gas station that's open 24 hours.

01:24.375 --> 01:27.754
You do not want to see clientele
at Gas-n-Guzz before 11.

01:27.837 --> 01:31.341
We call them Morning Joes
and they're an absolute nightmare.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.383
Not important.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.678
I took your advice,
throwing myself into the business.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.431
In fact, I made a to-do list.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.768
At work by 8 and a list,
did somebody rise and grind?

01:41.851 --> 01:45.647
I did. Opened a bank account,
transferred utilities into my name,

01:45.730 --> 01:49.025
and I even talked to a lawyer
about legal stuff.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.777
-They're good with that.
-Smart.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.364
It's all on me. No corporate.
I am the Blockbuster dad now.

01:54.447 --> 01:59.494
I got bills to pay and ties to wear
and James Patterson books to read.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.080
So you can call me
"the Blockbuster daddy."

02:02.163 --> 02:05.166
Ehh. Why are we listening to weird music?

02:05.250 --> 02:08.795
Is this "End of the World as We Know It",
but no lyrics? The melody won't hold.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.840
Blockbuster daddy is on hold
with our health insurance agent.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.550
Don't wanna let your bennies lapse.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.261
-<i>You're all set, Mr. Yoon.</i>
-Thank you, sir.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.390
All that's left on my list
is get Percy to put the lease in my name.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.017
Get on Zazzle
and start designing me a mug,

02:23.101 --> 02:25.061
"World's Best Blockbuster Daddy."

02:27.397 --> 02:30.483
This new "daddy" thing aside,
with Timmy this focused

02:30.567 --> 02:33.987
and the influx of customers
from my block party idea...

02:34.070 --> 02:37.073
-You mean my video.
-...I think we're gonna be okay.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.451
If I don't fire somebody by 5,
I'll lose the store.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.703
Whoo!

02:46.958 --> 02:49.210
What happened?
I thought things were going great.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.504
You had the customers
from that news thing.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.924
For the first time
your store has more people than rats.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.677
Damn.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.263
I've only seen your hair turn white
three other times.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.806
When your parents got a divorce,

03:01.890 --> 03:05.185
when you were slow dancing
to "November Rain" with Denise Carrera--

03:05.268 --> 03:07.770
You held a fart so long,
you went to the emergency room.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.023
--and your mom made
your 13th birthday a roast.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.358
-Cherished memories. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.736
Everything is way more expensive
without corporate.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.530
Payroll taxes, zero vendor discounts.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.866
You know I needed permits
to keep the store legal?

03:19.949 --> 03:20.992
I did not.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.203
I stopped paying a Scottish mob
for protection.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.580
That unhoused gentleman in a kilt
only comes around

03:25.663 --> 03:27.582
because you keep giving him $20.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.793
I basically have to fire
one of my friends, my family.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.214
I'll tell you, man, that sucks big time.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.592
Whose can is getting canned?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.971
<i>...there for an hour,</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:45.642
<i>and she agreed to buy the bird,</i>
<i>then she said I could...</i>

03:45.725 --> 03:48.811
It's bad when she
makes eye contact with the bailiff.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.942
<i>-She gave me a check...</i>
-I'm glad this place didn't close.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.401
I'd really miss this.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.403
-Me too.
-<i>"Balance $400."</i>

03:58.404 --> 04:00.323
-No!
-Who gets the parrots?

04:00.406 --> 04:03.159
<i>Some sad breaking news out of Iron Creek,</i>

04:03.243 --> 04:06.454
<i>where our beloved local movie reviewer</i>
<i>has passed away.</i>

04:06.537 --> 04:10.166
It's that guy who comes in every month
to do his Hollywood Harold's Flicky Picks.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.043
Then blows up our bathroom.

04:12.126 --> 04:15.505
<i>-...every Wednesday and Friday since 1950.</i>
-Rest in peace.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.632
<i>Funny man James Eugene Carrey,</i>

04:17.715 --> 04:22.679
<i>the always unapologetically</i>
<i>Canadian thespian, is in a new movie.</i>

04:22.762 --> 04:28.017
<i>But unfortunately, I'm gonna</i>
<i>havetosay"no, sir" to </i>Yes Man.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.940
-Who got the parrot?
-We don't know, that guy died.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.360
What? Hollywood Harold died?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.405
That's crazy. He was a-- He was a hero.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.532
I try to reserve "hero"
for first responders

04:42.615 --> 04:44.367
and geese Sully Sullenberger murdered.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.536
<i>A local legend taken too soon.</i>

04:47.078 --> 04:49.789
<i>I'm Miranda Golder</i>
<i>fillinginfor Remington Alexander,</i>

04:49.872 --> 04:50.999
<i>who is on vacation.</i>

04:53.084 --> 04:55.295
Bye. What was that all--?

04:55.378 --> 04:57.588
Ooh! We're back, baby.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.008
Neither of them deserves the parrot.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.677
<i>...medical center said returnthe bird...</i>

05:06.931 --> 05:10.351
What the hell is this?
Olivia Rodrigo's unfortunate cousin?

05:10.893 --> 05:14.022
It's my daughter's band,
the Trampoline Busters.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.441
There's no corporate,
we can play whatever we want.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.901
-Your daughter released an album?
-Mm-hm.

05:18.985 --> 05:19.902
On SoundCloud.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.905
I burned a CD
so I could listen to it in my Volvo,

05:22.989 --> 05:24.741
but I only have a tape deck.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.618
-This is my first time listening to it.
-Bleak.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.163
Ooh! I love this one.
The drums are so quick.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.623
These lyrics are clearly about you.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.000
What?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.002
"I'm not a little girl, proper and polite.

05:36.085 --> 05:39.213
I'm a grown-ass woman,
I don't wanna split my Sprite."

05:39.881 --> 05:41.299
No, they're not.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.926
It's about becoming your own person.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.679
Fighting to break free
from the man. Right?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.848
Yeah. You're the man.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.433
I get it. Moms suck.

05:50.516 --> 05:55.396
My mom wouldn't even let me get a tattoo.
It would have been so cool. Look.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.775
-That's a pentagram.
-It's more.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.068
It's five triangles.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.153
See, moms don't get it.

06:02.236 --> 06:06.949
Things have been a little tense lately,
but we're on the upswing.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.078
We run a thriving island
in <i>Animal Crossing, </i>okay?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.498
If Ali had a problem with me,
she'd tell me.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.959
True. Because teenage girls
are never passive-aggressive.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.799
This feels like having to give up a child.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.051
I can't imagine them not being here.

06:26.135 --> 06:29.472
I did have one last-ditch idea
that just might work.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.640
Lay it on me.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.810
So you know how Blockbuster
used to pay half my rent?

06:34.310 --> 06:37.188
Is there any way
that you could reduce my rent--?

06:37.271 --> 06:40.191
One thing we know is,
you're not gonna fire Kayla.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.443
-Is that something we know?
-That's my daughter.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.196
You can't fire my daughter.
I'm your friend.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.365
-Fire Eliza.
-Eliza's off the table.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.451
She's basically a minimum wage MBA.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.704
Not Carlos, that man is a movie genius.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.332
He got someone
to rent <i>Garden State </i>after 2004.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.250
He's good.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.335
Not Connie. She brings soup and hugs.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.296
One time she hugged me
with soup in her hand and burnt my back.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.299
-You let it go, the soup is good.
-That butternut squash is bomb.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.427
She's the same age
as most of our clientele.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.887
Who else will know
Hank Ackerman means Hugh Jackman?

07:09.971 --> 07:13.182
-I want some butternut squash soup.
-And not Hannah. She's good at...

07:14.100 --> 07:15.685
She's the sweetest person.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.481
And I just took everyone off the table.
It's an empty table.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.441
Not Kayla.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.194
Yes, Kayla. If this will be fair,
we have to consider everyone.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.989
How about I consider raising your rent?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.198
-Damn it.
-Yeah.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.534
-This will be harder than I thought.
-Mm-hm.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.328
It's like taking up skateboarding
at 38 again.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.497
The last time I drew a dick on a arm cast.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.833
That's right. It was very realistic.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.340
Hollywood Harold's
love of movies inspired

07:46.424 --> 07:49.010
millions and millions of Michiganders.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.512
-Mm.
-Okay. Thousands.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.723
He was literally married to movies.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.808
He gave <i>Schindler's List</i> five smooches.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.353
We have to find a new purpose
for this rack that honors his legacy.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.271
Okay?

08:01.147 --> 08:01.981
Any ideas?

08:03.232 --> 08:04.066
Yeah.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.154
A section for all those movies
where a man and woman fall in love,

08:08.779 --> 08:10.364
and they're perfect for each other.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.783
But the man starts aging in reverse.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.285
All those movies?

08:14.368 --> 08:17.413
A rack dedicated to trilogies
where the middle one is the best,

08:17.497 --> 08:18.581
like <i>National Treasure.</i>

08:18.664 --> 08:20.541
Only two <i>National Treasure</i> movies.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.502
<i>Wicker Man</i> is the third<i>.</i>

08:22.585 --> 08:24.879
Why are you in this meeting?

08:24.962 --> 08:26.130
Concerned customer.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.759
-What about an adult section?
-Oh, Jesus, Connie.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.928
-Ew.
-No, no. Not like stag films.

08:32.011 --> 08:36.474
I mean movies with sophisticated,
adult themes like <i>The Remains of the Day.</i>

08:36.557 --> 08:38.601
Should duty come before love?

08:38.684 --> 08:39.810
Va, va, voom!

08:39.894 --> 08:43.147
Maybe leave the rack empty.
A symbol of what we've lost.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.359
An empty rack is a symbol
we're going out of business,

08:46.442 --> 08:49.278
which is a vibe
we're actively working against.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.198
What about employee picks?

08:52.281 --> 08:54.116
Okay, I like that.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.036
A little basic, but Harold
would've put his own spin on things.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.831
Like Halvsies, you watch the beginning
of one movie and the end of another.

09:00.915 --> 09:04.377
The time he did the beginning of <i>Bambi</i>
with the end of <i>E.T.</i>

09:04.460 --> 09:07.213
Oh! It was just a straight-up sob fest,
no relief.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.341
But you could put
your own spin on things.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.719
Employee picks,
but I'll figure out a twist.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.974
-Hollywood Harold would have loved that.
-I'd like to say a few words about him.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.434
To quote my favorite musician,

09:20.518 --> 09:22.520
"You are not, not the worst."

09:22.603 --> 09:23.604
Double negative.

09:23.688 --> 09:28.234
"You will not, not, not control me."
Triple negative. Double, triple negative.

09:28.317 --> 09:33.364
"Eliza Walker, you're the worst."
Still think these lyrics aren't about you?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.200
How was that about Harold?

09:36.909 --> 09:39.120
-I got something.
-What you got?

09:40.663 --> 09:41.497
I lost it.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.124
Hate that when it happens.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.458
Sucks.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.043
-It's back.
-I love that.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.629
I know we said no
to psychological warfare,

09:48.713 --> 09:52.800
but there's something in the area
making the employees decide for us.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.595
I bet if we just ask them a few questions,

09:55.678 --> 09:57.722
the person I should fire
would become obvious.

09:57.805 --> 10:01.017
Yeah. Like a reverse job interview.

10:01.100 --> 10:01.934
Exactly.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.646
Clockwise, you working,
and counterclockwise your ass fired.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.648
I bet one doesn't need this job.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.942
No offense, who'd work at Blockbuster

10:10.026 --> 10:12.278
if they didn't absolutely have to?

10:13.529 --> 10:16.449
Ultimately, I decided
even if it is a microchip,

10:16.532 --> 10:17.908
let the government spy.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.578
I promised Helen
we'd see Jeff Dunham live.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.831
Totally, but I asked why you took the job.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.499
Not why you took the jab.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.335
Oh!

10:28.461 --> 10:30.171
Okay, well, let's see.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.173
For one, you all, of course.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.967
Number two, gotta get my steps.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.472
And three, probably watching judge shows
with Hannah.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.850
So you're saying you don't need this job?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.353
I guess not totally, financially.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.229
-All we needed to hear.
-Yeah.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.317
Emotionally on the other hand,
that's another story.

10:52.568 --> 10:56.364
Before I started working here,
I don't know how I filled my days.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.659
Got catfished a bunch, of course.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.203
SWAT'd myself more than once.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.373
Hooked on nasal sprays for a piece,

11:06.123 --> 11:09.794
mostly just farted around Shondaland
in my pajama jeans shorts.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.923
One night,
I was putting Christmas lights on the roof

11:15.007 --> 11:18.719
and I just started inching
towards the edge. Inching.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.181
Inching, inching.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.601
I cannot thank you enough for this job.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.436
Saved my life.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.773
Literally. You remember
that Malaysian airplane that disappeared?

11:30.856 --> 11:33.025
I was supposed to be on it
the day you hired me.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.110
That'll do. Thank you.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.861
Is something going on?

11:35.945 --> 11:36.862
As if.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.532
Is that a new gray patch?

11:39.615 --> 11:41.492
Oh, yeah, trying something.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.827
Keep up the hard work.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.786
Carry on. Bye.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.669
Carlos. What do you consider
your job strengths and weaknesses?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.587
Where do you see yourself in five years?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.048
-Pick a name.
-He don't have time.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.552
I'm replacing the Hollywood Harold section
with Employee Picks.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.304
Pick a name, then a movie
you think that person would like.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.390
Another great idea.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.226
A new way to connect
with customers and each other.

12:07.309 --> 12:10.104
You're like our Zuckerberg except
you won't destroy democracy,

12:10.187 --> 12:11.397
and don't eat your hair.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.732
Thanks, man.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.733
Hannah.

12:14.358 --> 12:17.319
-That man deserves a raise.
-You're moving in the wrong direction.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.572
I didn't say I'd give him a raise.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.615
-You're out of Cool Ranch.
-You ate it all.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.784
I told you to put two rows in!

12:26.328 --> 12:28.581
Have you noticed Timmy acting strange?

12:28.664 --> 12:31.667
I feel someone's about
to get voted off the island.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.169
I don't know. Listen...

12:33.252 --> 12:36.714
Do I have an annoying presence
on Instagram? My daughter--

12:36.797 --> 12:39.884
Personally, I unfollowed you
because you'd write "needed this today"

12:39.967 --> 12:41.635
under all of Michelle Obama's posts.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.054
You unfollowed me? When?

12:44.722 --> 12:47.808
Wow. I've been misjudging
all my relationships.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.936
-I can see you doing that.
-I don't know that you're one to judge.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.439
Once a week you post a picture
of Snoopy drinking rosÃ©

12:53.522 --> 12:56.609
with "in dog wines I've only had one"
under it, so...

12:57.568 --> 12:59.695
Come on, Connie, this is serious.

12:59.779 --> 13:04.366
I think that Ali is blaming me for all
of the problems between her dad and me.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.826
Listen to these lyrics,

13:06.327 --> 13:10.122
"A studio apartment isn't a home,
you're gonna be 43 and alone.

13:10.206 --> 13:14.376
Drinking wine with no remorse
while I become another child of divorce."

13:17.004 --> 13:18.297
It's just so funny.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.508
Snoopy using stemware.

13:20.591 --> 13:21.550
Can you imagine?

13:22.676 --> 13:25.179
Have you done your Hollywood Harold
movie picks yet?

13:25.262 --> 13:28.474
-Is there a spending limit?
-It is not a Secret Santa.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.645
Is this a test
to determine who gets fired?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.356
-What?
-Someone's getting fired?

13:36.232 --> 13:38.400
So listen, Kay.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.319
Kay-money, Kmart.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.654
Oh, no, thank you.

13:42.154 --> 13:46.784
Um, I wanted to check in,
see how you're liking things here.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.702
Oh.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.330
Walking into a dusty time capsule
every day,

13:51.413 --> 13:54.375
and having some gross dude
in a <i>Gremlins</i> T-shirt mutter,

13:54.458 --> 13:56.460
"You weren't born
when this movie came out,"

13:56.544 --> 13:59.255
is honestly every 16-year-old's dream.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.049
-So you hate it here?
-No.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.761
Let's just say
that every time I have to come in,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.180
it gets a bit harder to get out of bed.

14:11.058 --> 14:15.187
Kayla, I am very sorry,
but I think I'm gonna have to let--

14:15.271 --> 14:17.064
-What the--?

14:18.524 --> 14:19.358
Hey, Kayla.

14:19.441 --> 14:23.237
There's a boy who needs
to be reminded about his privilege,

14:23.320 --> 14:27.199
I know you love that kind of stuff.
Go give him a thing or two.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.243
Make Daddy proud. Okay.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.705
Sneaky man. You tried to fire my daughter.

14:32.788 --> 14:36.208
-She literally told me she hates it here.
-Fire Eliza.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.419
Talk about a person
who doesn't wanna be here.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.254
Always saying she's overqualified

14:40.337 --> 14:43.048
and using those triple-point
Scrabble words to confuse me.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.259
Firing Eliza would be insane.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.469
I see what's happening here.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.180
You keeping her around for eye candy.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.100
-Oh, come on.
-You got a big old crush on her.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.310
Look at you.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.561
Wow.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.730
You can't do that in this climate.

14:57.813 --> 14:58.814
That is not it.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.608
I am glad we're just friends.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.109
I'm rooting for her and Aaron.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.069
-They're my Ross and Rachel.
-Mm-hm.

15:04.153 --> 15:08.407
-She saved us with that block party.
-I saved you with the block party.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.200
I'm the reason we went viral.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.037
Because you lit a 40-foot gorilla on fire.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.289
Look, it's Kayla.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.083
I can't fire adults
who actually need this job.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.004
"Can't" is not in a man's vocabulary.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.590
Quoting <i>Love and Basketball</i>
is not gonna change my mind.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.759
Maybe tripling your rent will.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.179
These people's lives are in my hands.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.805
It's too much pressure.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.267
Like when the judge told me to point
to which parent I wanted to live with.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.102
-If not Kayla, who?

15:38.479 --> 15:42.358
Hey, hi. So you might get some calls
from angry parents

15:42.441 --> 15:46.195
because I confused <i>Hungry Caterpillar</i>
with <i>Human Centipede.</i>

15:46.278 --> 15:47.780
You can't be mad, though.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.075
I told you that I did not know a lot
about most movies.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.494
Okay, bye.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.251
She makes mistakes, but she's a good kid.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.671
-Sorry to interrupt again.
-Oh, no.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.256
The <i>Human Centipede</i> situation
has escalated

16:06.340 --> 16:09.927
and the superintendent of all schools
is on the phone for you

16:10.010 --> 16:12.930
and he's "I can hear him breathing" upset.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.848
Again, don't be mad.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.935
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

16:20.771 --> 16:24.108
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?Hello?</i>

16:24.191 --> 16:25.526
I'll fire Hannah.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.447
-Tomorrow.
-Timmy.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.991
-I wanna soften the blow.
-Timmy.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.911
It's not my fault the nearest
Edible Arrangements is in Ann Arbor.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.413
Whoa.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.790
Is someone getting fired?

16:39.873 --> 16:40.833
-Yes.
-No.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.087
-How did you know?
-You're acting weird,

16:45.170 --> 16:47.923
-a patch of your hair turned gray.
-Again?

16:48.007 --> 16:51.969
Percy asked, "Would you freak out
if you didn't work here anymore?"

16:52.052 --> 16:53.220
Jesus, Percy.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.431
In my mind, it was a trick question.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.349
So who is it?

16:58.017 --> 16:58.934
It's, uh--

17:00.185 --> 17:01.020
It's--

17:02.187 --> 17:04.732
Any chance I could just text the person?

17:04.815 --> 17:08.110
Guys, the employee picks with a twist
section is nowhere near finished.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.446
-Who's your pick?
-I'm in the middle of something.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.449
It's important.
Why is no one taking it seriously?

17:13.532 --> 17:14.742
I put up my picks.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.870
I got Eliza, so I went with <i>Bad Moms,</i>
<i>Bad Moms Christmas,</i>

17:17.953 --> 17:19.830
-<i>Throw Momma from the Train.</i>
-Stop.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.583
Carlos, why are you obsessing
over stupid Hollywood Harold

17:22.666 --> 17:24.251
when someone is getting fired?

17:24.334 --> 17:25.753
I love Hollywood Harold,

17:25.836 --> 17:29.173
and someone getting fired
doesn't make him any less dead.

17:29.256 --> 17:32.926
-So someone is getting fired?
-Just tell us who it is, Timmy!

17:33.010 --> 17:33.969
Okay.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.597
-I am so, so sorry, but it's--
-I quit.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.141
-Kayla, no.
-You can't leave us.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.477
You need to teach me what "lit" means.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.188
Me quitting makes things easier
for everyone.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.106
Plus, this place sucks.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.025
-Kayla.
-Sucks?

17:48.108 --> 17:49.526
-Kayla.
-What the--?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.737
-Is she serious?
-Oh, my God.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.616
This seems like a bad time, I know.

17:55.699 --> 18:00.329
I'm looking for a Robert De Niro movie
where he doesn't play a naughty grandpa.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.246
Any ideas?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.385
I can't believe she actually quit.

18:15.886 --> 18:16.970
It's crazy.

18:17.679 --> 18:21.266
I'm gonna miss her. Not the part of her
that likes to point out my faults,

18:21.350 --> 18:25.604
like how my relationship with my daughter
is a total mess, but "her" her.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.691
What? Why aren't you
taking this problem seriously?

18:29.775 --> 18:31.568
Because it's not a problem.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.363
It's not a problem that Ali hates me

18:34.446 --> 18:37.241
even though I gave up so much
to be her mother?

18:37.324 --> 18:38.534
Including Harvard.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.535
Subtle.

18:41.453 --> 18:45.207
Look, it's a good thing she's lashing out.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.836
Your family went through
a rough six months.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.463
Means she's working through it.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.675
It's when they bottle it up
you gotta worry.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.262
My son drove his car
through the front of a Wendy's.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.013
He's a lawyer now.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.391
Huh.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.352
But it's so unfair.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.855
Her dad is the one who cheated.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.232
Not that I'd tell her that.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.402
Why does she have to take it out on me?

19:14.027 --> 19:15.779
She feels safe enough to.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.532
She knows no matter what she says,

19:18.615 --> 19:20.450
you'll always love her.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.245
You're a good mom, Eliza.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.789
You really think so?

19:27.666 --> 19:28.750
Thanks.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.420
I really needed that.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.671
Of course.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.965
I'm here for you.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.260
Whenever we work the same shift.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.440
Kind of a rough day, huh?

19:51.523 --> 19:54.776
I mean, mine got rough
a couple of hours ago, but...

19:54.860 --> 19:56.904
you've had a rough one since you got here.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.697
Yeah. Whatever, you know.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.575
What's up with you
and Hollywood Harold?

20:01.658 --> 20:04.494
Don't say you'll miss
his show-stopping hairline.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.748
Um...

20:08.373 --> 20:11.501
Look, my family moved
to the States when I was 5

20:11.585 --> 20:13.253
and we only got one channel.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.881
So I saw a lot of Hollywood Harold.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.634
I learned English
from the movies he played.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.928
That's why I still say "buddy."

20:21.011 --> 20:23.847
I thought you just
really loved <i>Encino Man.</i>

20:25.474 --> 20:27.893
I didn't have any friends as a kid.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.481
And... he felt like a friend.

20:33.941 --> 20:34.983
That's so sweet.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.486
I wish you told me.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.656
You and Hollywood Harold
are like a platonic rom-com.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.784
I wanted people to care
about the employee picks

20:43.867 --> 20:45.911
the way that Harold
made me care about movies.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.497
I did take the employee picks seriously.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.582
It was easy since I picked myself.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.875
That makes no sense.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.753
Harold would've loved it.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.881
Think he would love... this?

20:57.965 --> 21:01.760
-We could dedicate this section to him.
-You made a plaque for Harold?

21:01.843 --> 21:05.931
No, I made it for you
because you're my buddy.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.019
-Aw. Thanks.
<i>-In a twist</i>

21:11.103 --> 21:14.398
<i>-with beloved Iron Creek movie reviewer.</i>
-The news is covering him again.

21:14.481 --> 21:18.485

<i>because ferrets don't have thumbs.</i>

21:38.380 --> 21:40.549
Hey. You all right?

21:40.632 --> 21:44.011
Not really. Turns out
being the Blockbuster daddy sucks.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.263
Still not loving that nickname.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.641
But trust me, I know how you feel.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.313
You can't always be everyone's friend
when you're trying to do what's best.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.397
And it sucks.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.274
But I'm sorry.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.151
Thanks.

21:59.234 --> 22:02.571
Why didn't you ask for my help?
I thought we were a team.

22:02.654 --> 22:06.033
I guess that would've been awkward
since I was on the chopping block too.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.618
No, you weren't. I can't live without you.

22:09.786 --> 22:12.706
Um, the store can't survive without you.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.166
'cause you're so great.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.461
As my employee and my friend,
because we're friends.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.505
Of course we're friends.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.924
Why are you acting so weird lately?

22:23.008 --> 22:26.928
Why are you? I'm stressed.
Mercury's in retrograde. Shall we?

22:27.512 --> 22:28.638
Okay.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.851
-I just hope Kayla's all right.
-Oh, no one needs to worry about Kayla.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.187
She already gets paid to put on makeup

22:35.270 --> 22:38.940
while lip-synching John Mulaney bits
on TikTok for some reason.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.902
Oh, I'm old.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.236
Gray streak isn't helping.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.906
But for what it's worth,

22:45.989 --> 22:47.449
I'm really proud of you.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.034
Thanks.

22:52.662 --> 22:56.750
Maybe I am getting the hang
of being a "boss" boss, after all.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.544
Someone called me "sir"
and I didn't look around for my dad.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.548
My first tough day
is officially in the books.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.510
-I'm not letting you let Kayla quit.
-It's done.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.637
I love Kayla
like a daughter you made me hire,

23:08.720 --> 23:10.430
but I can't keep her on as a favor.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.766
It's more than that. The truth is...

23:13.308 --> 23:15.519
I asked you to hire her

23:15.602 --> 23:19.356
so that I had an excuse
to spend more time with her.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.399
Aw.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.985
Shut up. When she was younger,
I could just pick her up,

23:24.069 --> 23:26.279
take her to get ice cream
and she loved it.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.573
Loved being around her daddy.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.492
But it's not like that anymore.

23:30.575 --> 23:34.704
That's painful for a certified girl dad
like myself because I love her.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.248
Or whatever.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.874
Why didn't you tell me?

23:37.958 --> 23:40.836
I got a reputation to maintain
in these streets.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.963
As the owner of a party store?

23:43.046 --> 23:45.966
Look, the point is this,
I'll pay her salary,

23:46.049 --> 23:48.218
just don't tell Kayla that I--

23:48.301 --> 23:50.137
-Tell me what?
-Um...

23:50.220 --> 23:55.934
Uh, that I found the money
and you don't have to quit after all.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.062
Yeah, okay, whatever.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.480
I love the enthusiasm.

24:00.564 --> 24:04.443
-I'll put this back in my locker.
-Is that my new Hydro Flask?

24:05.193 --> 24:07.529
Yeah, but I love it or whatever.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.323
Yeah, hashtag "girl dad."

24:11.032 --> 24:12.826
-Being a parent sucks.
-Right!?

24:12.909 --> 24:13.827
-Right.
-No.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.954
Blockbuster daddy
does not count as parenting.

24:16.037 --> 24:18.039
Don't normalize that nickname.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.125
-I won't. It's catchy.
-All right.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.627
Ah. I can't believe it.

24:22.711 --> 24:26.715
I didn't have to fire anyone
and now you owe me big time, Percy.

24:26.798 --> 24:30.218
Goes to show things always work out
when you do your best

24:30.302 --> 24:32.262
and you lead with kindness, and--

24:34.514 --> 24:35.599
What the hell?

24:38.852 --> 24:41.188
What set off all those alarms?

24:45.233 --> 24:46.067
Oh, no.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.986
They're back.
