Mark!

00:16.691 --> 00:19.516
<i>Medellin</i> is the story of Pablo Escobar,

00:19.900 --> 00:22.416
one of the greatest outlaws
the world had ever known.

00:22.562 --> 00:24.589
And what attracted you to this project?

00:25.096 --> 00:27.792
What attracted me to this project?

00:30.250 --> 00:31.264
Everything.

00:31.395 --> 00:34.391
It was the script for me. The first time
I read it, I couldn't put it down.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.123
I knew it was a movie,
an exciting movie.

00:36.406 --> 00:40.085
What attracted me to this project?
Well, that's easy.

00:41.759 --> 00:43.036
It was the blood.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.864
<i>a completely independently

02:17.066 --> 02:18.891
<i>set out into the hills of Colombia</i>

02:19.067 --> 02:22.625
<i>to make a movie about one of the most
feared drug lords in history.</i>

02:23.497 --> 02:25.861
<i>A young director,
first-time producer,</i>

02:26.024 --> 02:28.568
<i>and an up-and-coming
movie star all had one goal...</i>

02:28.723 --> 02:30.029

02:30.115 --> 02:31.443
People, people!

02:31.601 --> 02:33.807
<i>I was invited along
to document the ride.</i>

02:33.900 --> 02:35.994
Gather around!
Gather around!

02:38.938 --> 02:40.762
Everyone take a moment.
Breath in the air.

02:42.470 --> 02:45.037
Focus on your surroundings.
This is now your home.

02:46.032 --> 02:48.036
Everything you left behind
is behind you.

02:48.271 --> 02:49.869
Whether it be your wife,
your children,

02:49.982 --> 02:52.886
or your fucking cocker spaniel
named Lucy, none of them matters.

02:53.291 --> 02:56.038
The only thing that matters
is what you can see.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.557
Thank you.

02:59.949 --> 03:02.291
I knew going into this
that Billy was gonna be a handful.

03:02.358 --> 03:04.790
It was my job to handle him
and bring the movie in on budget.

03:04.856 --> 03:06.229
But you have no experience.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.403
No, none, actually.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.699
In fact, four years ago,
I was running a pizza place.

03:10.835 --> 03:13.785
And now they put you in charge
of a $30-million budget?

03:14.700 --> 03:15.800
Only in Hollywood, right?

03:16.641 --> 03:18.000
So how do you know what to do?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.423
I mean, you don't.
You learn on the job. You have to.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.449
And he has this book to help.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.600
He reads it every night.
He keeps it under his pillow.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.387
I have read it about 60 times.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.292
Okay, next scene up,

03:30.506 --> 03:31.947
scene 167...

03:32.600 --> 03:34.548
The storming of Pablo's private prison.

03:34.758 --> 03:36.559
Okay, how many extras will we have?

03:37.200 --> 03:39.077
400, just like the script asked for.

03:39.516 --> 03:40.529
It ain't enough.

03:41.206 --> 03:42.489
It's what the script says.

03:42.602 --> 03:44.115
It needs to be overwhelming.

03:44.205 --> 03:45.601
We need to fill the whole frame.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.142
I'd say another 1,000 will do it.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.302
This is the real Clombian army
we're getting here.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.600
We're getting them cheap.

03:50.661 --> 03:52.745
Can't just throw another 1,000
even at that price.

03:52.790 --> 03:54.388
Turn your motherfucking cell phones off.

03:54.530 --> 03:56.599
Sorry, it's my bad.
There hasn't been any service.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.208
That is the last fucking cell phone

03:58.276 --> 04:01.000
that I wanna hear in the next 45 days
that we spend together.

04:01.178 --> 04:02.700
I'm telling you all right now,

04:03.300 --> 04:04.387
if another cell phone rings

04:04.455 --> 04:06.338
while professional artists
are trying to work,

04:06.405 --> 04:07.869
the responsible
for that distraction

04:07.914 --> 04:09.917
will be dragged into town
and sold as a drug mule.

04:09.963 --> 04:11.696
Does everyone understand
what I'm saying?

04:13.500 --> 04:16.480
It was my bad, okay? But there really
hasn't been any cell phone service.

04:16.601 --> 04:18.019
I think the guy overreacted.

04:18.187 --> 04:20.572
It's just a production meeting.
Not like I blew a shot.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.147
And it's Sunday.
I got to get my football picks in.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.522
I always try to steer my clients away

04:25.599 --> 04:27.873
from working with
inexperienced directors and producers,

04:27.941 --> 04:29.412
because why take a chance?

04:30.100 --> 04:32.894
Vinnie really wanted to do this movie
and there was no stopping him.

04:32.957 --> 04:34.938
But then, when he wanted
to put up his own money,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.199
I thought that was crazy,

04:36.245 --> 04:38.677
because, look,
most movies lose money.

04:38.832 --> 04:41.106
It's my job as a talent representative

04:41.173 --> 04:43.920
to make sure that even if a movie
loses all of its money,

04:44.026 --> 04:46.000
my client still sees all of his.

04:48.402 --> 04:50.399
I've never heard you
mention this problem before.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.334
Makes no difference.
I'm telling you now.

04:52.395 --> 04:54.700
Make sure a crane can
pull right through there. Got it?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.500
- Have you heard it?
- I haven't heard it.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.892
- You don't disagree?
- No, I don't. Do you?

04:58.977 --> 05:01.280
I don't know 'cause I haven't heard
what the problem is.

05:01.325 --> 05:03.399
The problem, suit, is that
we don't have an ending.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.700
I'm sorry, let me correct that.
We have a shitty ending.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.400
An endinthat will take a genius film
that people are loving,

05:08.535 --> 05:09.998
turn them on a dime against us,

05:10.043 --> 05:13.600
and have them walking out of the theater
shaking their fucking heads in disgust.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.000
We're supposed to shoot in three days.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.145
The guy suddenly tells us that
he hates the ending? So what do you do?

05:20.467 --> 05:21.863
Shoot yourself in the head

05:22.100 --> 05:23.754
with a large-caliber bullet.

05:24.337 --> 05:26.755
- I say we shut down for a week.
- No!

05:26.813 --> 05:28.979
We work on the ending...
It'll cost us a little money,

05:29.002 --> 05:31.944
but if we start shooting and then
have to shut down it'll be disastrous.

05:32.057 --> 05:33.577
We'll have something to shoot.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.200
I'm ready to roll.
I don't want to slow down.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.389
- So we're in agreement.
- It's up to E.

05:40.473 --> 05:43.371
Don't worry, suit.
I promise we'll have something to shoot.

05:43.461 --> 05:46.500
I'll write it and it will be brilliant.
I promise, okay?

05:48.400 --> 05:49.500
- Okay.
- All right!

05:54.700 --> 05:56.494
You don't get on a set,
get ready to shoot,

05:56.612 --> 05:57.783
and then ask for rewrites.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.321
Studios do this crap all the time

05:59.366 --> 06:01.385
and they wonder why
they end up with a shit movie.

06:01.497 --> 06:03.524
Movie? You know, I hate
the word "movie."

06:03.700 --> 06:05.929
I don't make movies.
I make films.

06:06.371 --> 06:08.014
You think you're invincible.

06:08.610 --> 06:10.096
Nobody invincible.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.092
Nothing is forever, Mr. Escobar.

06:12.965 --> 06:15.352
I appreciate your position,
Senor de Quintas.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.939
I know you have a job
and a family to provide for.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.192
- Three boys, no?
- Are you threatening me?

06:21.575 --> 06:24.142
Nobody is threatening nobody.

06:25.027 --> 06:26.513
Well, actually, I'm not in the movie.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.729
I'm just sitting in
on the table read as a favor

06:29.100 --> 06:30.452
until they find the real actor.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.845
You see, I'm not available.
I'm on a tv show...

06:34.800 --> 06:36.000
<i>Five Towns.</i>

06:36.500 --> 06:38.367
we had a very successful first season.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.198
And even though I'm on hiatus,

06:41.300 --> 06:44.005
I can't be in the movie.
Contractually I'm not available.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.084
Plus Billy didn't
really offer me anything.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.700
The Cali cartel is a figment
of your imagination, Pablo.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.942
They are ghosts.

06:56.343 --> 06:57.942
When's the next casting session?

06:58.016 --> 07:00.953
If I have to listen to anymore amateurs
I'm gonna slash my wrists.

07:00.998 --> 07:03.100
You want me to try that
with an accent, billy?

07:17.226 --> 07:19.400
- What I would do to that.
- Be professional.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.837
Okay, let's read through this once.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.607
I can read with.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.360
We can leave the kiss out.
Or not.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.692
Why are they in here?
Get them out.

07:30.998 --> 07:32.371
You guys got to go.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.500
Good luck.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.952
Sorry about that.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.152
Okay, let's do this.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.094
- I'm a little bit nervous.
- No, don't be.

07:55.217 --> 07:58.054
- So, what do you think?
- she's fantastic.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.237
I loved her, but we're talking
about the village girl.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.385
And?

08:02.500 --> 08:05.203
- It's just not how I saw her.
- No? How did you see her?

08:05.495 --> 08:08.017
Kind of like Linda Hunt
in <i>The Year of Living Dangerously.</i>

08:08.200 --> 08:09.921
- Really?
- What, you saw Salma Hayek?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.078
I didn't see Salma Hayek
when that girl just read.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.947
Have some fucking imagination, suit.

08:13.982 --> 08:16.499
Makeup, wardrobe.
She can be more plain as you say,

08:16.628 --> 08:19.059
but her essence
is something special.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.506
- Agreed, Vince?
- Yeah, agreed. E?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.164
Okay, makeup.

08:23.255 --> 08:25.484
Any shot she'll have a nude
scene in the film, Bill?

08:25.900 --> 08:27.513
Well, I didn't see it personally,

08:27.581 --> 08:30.297
but what I did believe was
that Billy knew exactly what he wanted.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.793
So it's my job to support him as long
as he got it all done.

08:32.861 --> 08:34.500
And the ending,
has he got that done?

08:34.943 --> 08:36.767
- Not yet.
- So what do you do?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.187
I support him for now.

08:40.211 --> 08:42.890
EIGHT WEEKS LATER (del vo)

08:50.082 --> 08:54.112
<i>October the 27th.
The first day of production had arrived.</i>

08:54.700 --> 08:56.069
<i>The sets were all up.</i>

08:56.168 --> 08:57.407
Why is that door red?

08:58.161 --> 08:59.737
- I thought it popped.
- It popped?

08:59.782 --> 09:02.393
How am I going to see
blood splatter on a red door?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.317
Fuckwad.
Change it.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.563
The actors were all cast.

09:06.615 --> 09:08.236
Show some fucking fire!

09:18.956 --> 09:20.513
As soon as I get this on, vinnie,

09:20.603 --> 09:23.356
we'll put that other eye in for you
and it'll be perfect.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.524
The makeup tests were all done.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.703
- Hey, billy!
- Holy shit.

09:27.771 --> 09:31.400
That can't be vincent chase.
Don't hurt me, Don Pablo! Don't hurt me.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.238
Beautiful job.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.566
Thank you, thank you.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.069
The nose needs to be more thick.

09:36.149 --> 09:38.929
No, that's a very accurate rendering.
He looks just like Pablo.

09:39.030 --> 09:40.807
Thicken it or I'll find someone who can.

09:40.896 --> 09:42.292
And don't put too much on her.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.469
She's perfect as is.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.400
<i>They're ready to shoot.</i>

09:47.500 --> 09:49.556
<i>I need quiet on the set, please.</i>

09:49.580 --> 09:50.699
Of course I'm nervous.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.577
It's only natural.
Who wouldn't be nervous?

09:52.712 --> 09:55.031
- I don't really get nervous.
- Only pussies get nervous.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.623
I'm freaking out a little bit.
It's all on the line on this one

09:57.668 --> 09:59.333
and I have no control.
I don't like that.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.327
Well, whenever you're about to shoot

10:01.500 --> 10:02.819
you get butterflies.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.482
But if you've prepared
and taken care of your instrument,

10:05.948 --> 10:07.119
what can go wrong?

10:07.900 --> 10:10.549
Tony Danza taught me that
when I did a little guest spot.

10:10.700 --> 10:12.187
We're about to roll out of film.

10:13.086 --> 10:14.482
We're gonna roll out of film.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.300
Can I finish my story here?

10:22.538 --> 10:24.452
Scene 16, take one.

10:45.682 --> 10:47.550
How are you, my friend? (del vo)

10:48.496 --> 10:52.470
Parton, I have asked the men and we do not know where the missing kilos gave gone. (del vo)

10:54.271 --> 10:56.185
That is very bad news. (del vo)

10:57.923 --> 11:00.197
Perhaps there has been a mistake. (del vo)

11:02.120 --> 11:07.254
Perhaps you should ask them again. As a favor for me, my friend? (del vo)

11:08.514 --> 11:10.090
Yes, of course. (del vo)

11:12.555 --> 11:14.941
Nino, will you come play a little game with me? (del vo)

12:24.253 --> 12:26.482
Come on, will you ever
doubt the guy again?

12:27.657 --> 12:28.899
That shit looked unbelievable.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.079
- Is this kid a movie star or what?
- Did you like it?

12:31.146 --> 12:33.998
If I don't get a little something
in this movie, I'm gonna kill myself.

12:34.043 --> 12:35.200
I guess he likes.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.937
There he is!

12:37.173 --> 12:40.190
The auteur extraordinaire.
Awesome, Billy.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.036
Bravo, Billy.
Bravo.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.224
What's wrong?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.659
- I hate it.
- You hate it?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.252
- I hate it.
- Why? It looks great.

12:47.355 --> 12:49.674
It looks like shit.
Like a hallmark hall of fame movie.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.299
Hey, I did a couple
good hallmark hall of fame movies.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.573
Over lit, man.
Dripping in shit.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.829
You jammed that D.P.
down my throat,

12:56.897 --> 12:58.702
and this is what happens
when I get jammed.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.974
- You picked the D.P.
- Off your list, suit.

13:01.042 --> 13:02.730
Your budget fucking list.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.799
You go budget,
you get a budget-ass look.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.961
- I swear it looks great.
- Vince, I love you,

13:07.006 --> 13:08.987
but I swear it don't.
It looks like shit.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.613
I feel like crying,
I hate it so much. I hate it!

13:11.800 --> 13:14.997
- Here comes Sven. Chill out.
- I hate it, I hate it.

13:14.998 --> 13:16.270
- Hey!
- Enough.

13:16.305 --> 13:17.611
We loving life, huh?

13:17.678 --> 13:20.100
I hate it! I hate it!
I fucking hate it!

13:22.424 --> 13:25.801
Your filters make it look like
someone came on the lens.

13:25.970 --> 13:29.800
- Get off of him.
- You big fucking Scandinavian pussy!

13:29.910 --> 13:32.400
I thought it looked great,
but I'm not a cinematographer.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.109
If billy thought that
it could look better,I believed him.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.797
I believed him too.
But still, we have a budget

13:37.865 --> 13:40.300
and I wouldn't have
let him fire the guy. But I had no say.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.200
After Billy humiliated him he quit.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.275
That always a good sign, right?
When the director starts offing people.

13:45.735 --> 13:46.910
Yeah, big fucking deal.

13:47.023 --> 13:49.500
I decided to shoot the thing myself,
save us some money.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.000
You're fearful.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.993
Like this is the most feared man
in Colombia, right?

13:54.105 --> 13:57.009
But you know that
he lusts after you.

13:57.953 --> 13:59.642
But I'm only selling bananas.

14:01.991 --> 14:04.017
- Why aren't we shooting?
- I just act, kid.

14:06.463 --> 14:07.700
What the fuck is going on?

14:08.266 --> 14:09.797
I think your director's got a crush.

14:09.855 --> 14:12.985
Don't burst his bubble,
but she's been eyeing me for days.

14:17.086 --> 14:18.300
Why aren't we shooting?

14:18.500 --> 14:20.959
- The light's not right.
- When's it going to be right?

14:22.245 --> 14:23.303
When the clouds move.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.600
When's that going to be?

14:24.700 --> 14:26.900
I'm a filmmaker, suit,
not a fucking weather man.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.383
- I'll let you guys talk.
- No, wait...

14:33.200 --> 14:34.467
So what do you want to do?

14:35.558 --> 14:36.700
What I've been doing...

14:37.238 --> 14:38.319
Waiting.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.639
We literally wait two days
for the guy to shoot.

14:43.752 --> 14:44.844
And when he finally does,

14:44.934 --> 14:46.938
suddenly he says,
"no one sees any more dailies."

14:47.198 --> 14:48.707
Nobody comes in here!

14:50.800 --> 14:53.942
You know, I'm not going to be judged
on my work by fucking novices.

14:55.351 --> 14:56.800
We may have snuck a peak.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.928
When billy's right,
he's right.

15:19.153 --> 15:20.234
It looked sick.

15:26.831 --> 15:27.934
Someone just in here?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.442
So is Billy doubting himself?

15:32.560 --> 15:35.017
Nah, Billy never doubts himself.
But something was wrong.

15:35.190 --> 15:38.005
I only have a couple of scenes
in the movie... film.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.315
So I don't understand why the director
wants to eat all his meals with me.

15:52.103 --> 15:53.100
And cut!

15:55.451 --> 15:57.838
That is beautiful.
That is beautiful. Print it!

15:58.548 --> 16:01.587
And everyone else...
Everyone else,

16:02.800 --> 16:04.100
learn from it.

16:06.808 --> 16:08.722
I am so pleased that
you're doing my film.

16:08.790 --> 16:10.636
I see real star quality in you.

16:10.783 --> 16:12.877
You're very Sophia Loren,
except not Italian.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.500
You comprende?

16:14.800 --> 16:16.978
Vince, guys, come join us.

16:17.496 --> 16:18.600
You mind?

16:18.900 --> 16:20.100
Why would I mind?

16:22.945 --> 16:24.679
Hi there.
How you doing?

16:27.036 --> 16:29.100
So, Billy, any word on the new ending?

16:30.726 --> 16:31.762
No.

16:32.227 --> 16:35.478
When a director falls
for an actor on set, all bets are off.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.543
When he doesn't get her,
bet you have a problem.

16:37.656 --> 16:40.042
When someone else gets her,
bet the house.

16:40.438 --> 16:43.000
I nailed one of my directors
on <i>Melrose place.</i>

16:44.500 --> 16:46.446
That was the year
they threw me off, actually.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.502
You think that
might've been the reason?

16:48.900 --> 16:50.919
I don't know.
I never really thought about that.

17:03.310 --> 17:05.005
Why are you hovering
around down there?

17:05.050 --> 17:06.355
We got to talk about the ending.

17:06.377 --> 17:07.513
- We do?
- Yeah, we do.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.705
How would you and me talking
about the ending help?

17:09.796 --> 17:11.327
Because time is running short.

17:11.538 --> 17:14.037
I don't have anything yet, suit,
but stuff is percolating.

17:14.173 --> 17:17.145
I don't have time for percolating.
I need pages to produce. You promised.

17:19.900 --> 17:20.912
Is something else wrong?

17:21.400 --> 17:22.884
Does it look like something's wrong?

17:23.928 --> 17:26.400
Everyone listen up,
I have something very important to say.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.399
Sex kills.

17:29.914 --> 17:32.256
It kills creativity,
it kills artistry.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.752
It kills a film set.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.998
There will be no sex here...
Not on my film set.

17:38.111 --> 17:39.709
I hope that I've made myself clear.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.479
- The ending, Billy.
- Percolating, suit.

17:42.900 --> 17:43.900
Percolating.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.803
I am not having sex with her.

17:47.876 --> 17:49.677
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.459
If I don't get a part in this movie

17:51.663 --> 17:53.487
I can have sex with her, technically,

17:53.611 --> 17:55.007
without offending Billy, right?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.153
Yeah, but you may offend
all the Colombians

17:57.221 --> 17:58.752
who would be sickened by the thought.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.927
- Walsh is getting obsessed.
- You think?

18:01.400 --> 18:02.900
I don't care, but he's not writing.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.300
What do you want me to do?

18:04.600 --> 18:05.800
Don't fuck her, for one.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.105
Seriously.
I can still fuck her, right?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.489
Yeah. Drama, if you
can get her, go for it.

18:12.193 --> 18:14.800
Oh, a challenge.
I love it.

18:16.673 --> 18:19.667
You are the most powerfull man in Columbia. (del vo)

18:19.982 --> 18:21.963
But I am nothing without love. (del vo)

18:23.573 --> 18:25.149
I'm scared of you. (del vo)

18:27.445 --> 18:29.292
You needn't be. (del vo)

18:33.200 --> 18:35.474
- Cut!
- What's the problem this time, Billy?

18:35.800 --> 18:36.847
It sucked.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.762
15 takes?
I don't get it.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.087
Would you please tell Mr. Chase that
I want some fucking passion out of him?

18:45.300 --> 18:47.274
- You don't want to tell him?
- I'd rather not.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.700
He wants some passion out of you.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.900
- He's not talking to me now?
- I guess not.

19:00.448 --> 19:02.069
Hey. Let's walk.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.757
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem

19:07.500 --> 19:09.300
Billy, I'm not fucking her.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.758
Swear on it, Vince.
Swear on your mother's life.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.323
I just told you I'm not.

19:14.415 --> 19:17.000
- Then who is?
- I have no idea if anyone is.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.714
Vinnie, man, she told me
she wanted to be friends.

19:22.968 --> 19:26.210
Show me the girl who wants to be friend,
I'll show you the guy who's fucking her.

19:26.255 --> 19:27.404
Well, it ain't me.

19:27.831 --> 19:29.092
So can we go back to work?

19:29.943 --> 19:31.654
Yeah, Vin,
go back to work.

19:32.163 --> 19:33.400
And will you write the ending?

19:34.013 --> 19:35.229
Yes, I will.

19:35.699 --> 19:36.978
He hasn't written shit.

19:37.316 --> 19:40.047
And when we're not shooting
all he does is sit in the bar and sulk.

19:41.918 --> 19:43.901
By thursday, we'll have shot
everything written,

19:43.946 --> 19:46.673
my greatest fear will be realized
and we're gonna have to shut down.

19:46.741 --> 19:49.150
- So, you're starting to panic?
- I'm way past panic.

19:49.782 --> 19:53.335
- Get me Stephen Gaghan.
- Stephen Gaghan?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.299
Yeah. You heard of him?
He wrote "Traffic."

19:55.300 --> 19:56.984
- I know who he is.
- He's a good writer.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.224
- It's a two-week job, tops.
- Why can't you write it?

20:00.162 --> 20:03.021
Rumors already started
about D.P.'s being fired,

20:03.095 --> 20:04.499
production delays, et cetera.

20:04.581 --> 20:08.115
But now they want an academy
award winner to do the rewrites?

20:08.200 --> 20:09.899
Ridiculous.
I told him he'd never do it.

20:10.061 --> 20:11.100
Yeah, I know stephen...

20:12.300 --> 20:14.000
From the brentwood country mart.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.300
Guy loves me.
He'll do it.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.904
Stephen Gaghan's going to cost us
over 200 grand a week.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.699
- So?
- So we can't afford it.

20:19.788 --> 20:21.747
What we can't afford
is not to have an ending.

20:22.313 --> 20:23.484
Figure it out, suit.

20:25.745 --> 20:27.838
This guy's going to
call me suit one too many times,

20:27.883 --> 20:29.955
I'm gonna knock
his fucking teeth out of his mouth.

20:29.977 --> 20:31.799
I called Ari
personally and asked him

20:31.870 --> 20:34.707
if he'd call our financier
and try and get us a little more money.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.794
I told Vince,
"ha ha ha."

20:37.300 --> 20:39.116
our financier
already had enough problems,

20:39.183 --> 20:40.309
you know what I'm saying?

20:41.300 --> 20:42.564
Well, what happened was

20:42.692 --> 20:44.499
I was on my way to
the airport in los angeles

20:44.500 --> 20:45.774
when I was pulled over

20:46.100 --> 20:47.984
and the officer found some cocaine.

20:48.358 --> 20:50.429
Well, it was a lot of cocaine.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.564
Actually.

20:52.862 --> 20:54.099
You're probably asking yourself

20:54.100 --> 20:57.527
why on earth was I bringing cocaine
to Colombia.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.823
Well, truthfully, I wasn't.

20:59.868 --> 21:02.899
As it turns out it was an old bag that
had been lying in my trunk for years.

21:02.921 --> 21:05.234
I had just completely
forgotten about it.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.555
In either case, the judge
didn't really buy that.

21:09.818 --> 21:12.800
Meanwhile, my passport has been taken
away while I await trial.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.934
- My bank accounts were frozen.
- Fuck you, man!

21:15.200 --> 21:18.085
And there's no more money just now.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.399
So I can only pray that the 30 mil
I sunk into this thing

21:22.513 --> 21:24.809
isn't going down some
Colombian drain. Right?

21:24.922 --> 21:29.000
'cause there's, you know,
no suicide watch here.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.500
You know what I mean?

21:32.300 --> 21:33.958
Vince, we can't afford Gaghan.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.931
We've got to get a list
of cheaper writers.

21:36.021 --> 21:37.304
He'll have to go for it.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.700
Don't use the word cheap.

21:38.829 --> 21:42.454
I'm heading to makeup,
see you on set. Hey, be firm.

21:42.543 --> 21:44.400
Have I not been?
Have I not been firm?

21:45.838 --> 21:46.897
What's going on?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.594
He's interrogating the crew to find out
who's been with his girl.

21:49.696 --> 21:51.300
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.800
I'm going to ask you
one time, chochito.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.789
And if I find out you're lying to me,
I'm not going to be happy.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.232
You understand what I'm saying?

22:00.300 --> 22:01.900
I do, Billy, I do.

22:02.108 --> 22:04.100
And I'm not lying.
I swear.

22:04.300 --> 22:07.049
I never touched her.
Never.

22:07.300 --> 22:08.347
Next.

22:10.913 --> 22:11.971
What's up, suit?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.731
- We need to talk, now.
- No, I'm busy.

22:13.812 --> 22:16.537
Get your ass up and walk with me
right now, or as god as my witness,

22:16.582 --> 22:19.499
I will send you packing today
and I will finish this movie without you.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.809
Who's going to direct, Turtle?

22:22.100 --> 22:23.600
I directed a couple shorts.

22:25.046 --> 22:27.116
What you're making
such a big deal about?

22:27.161 --> 22:28.714
You don't know what?

22:28.872 --> 22:30.335
You convince us we need a new ending,

22:30.358 --> 22:32.023
and while I'm trying
to make that happen,

22:32.046 --> 22:33.914
you're interrogating the crew
about this girl?

22:33.937 --> 22:35.265
I need to know who's fucking her.

22:35.288 --> 22:37.033
- We need an ending.
- And I need Gaghan.

22:37.075 --> 22:40.099
You can't have him, but I've got a list
of other writers you can look over.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.082
What, some cheap piece-of-shit hacks?

22:42.904 --> 22:45.499
I know in my heart
that Gaghan is the one guy

22:45.500 --> 22:47.137
who can get us to
where we need to be.

22:47.182 --> 22:48.567
You're supposed to be that guy,

22:48.635 --> 22:51.134
we have no more money and no way
of getting any more.

22:51.179 --> 22:53.300
- I'll get rid of the extra army guys.
- Not enough.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.600
And lose the Bogata
central library massacre.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.448
- You love that scene.
- I'm compromising.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.200
Since when? You're letting this
girl mess up your mind.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.797
- It's not about the girl.
- Then what's your fucking problem?

23:02.865 --> 23:04.899
Living in this jungle
for the past five months.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.291
- What, we haven't?
- You're just moving numbers around.

23:07.358 --> 23:08.822
I'm dealing with sets and extras

23:08.900 --> 23:11.499
and fucking explosions...
Big explosions, man.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.647
My last movie had
12 people in it. 12 total.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.316
Billy, it's going great.
You're killing it.

23:18.435 --> 23:20.545
It's killing me, suit.
I'm melting down.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.900
It's this humidity.
I can't think in this humidity.

23:23.036 --> 23:24.949
- And I need to think.
- You got to finish.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.346
- I can't.
- Yes, you can, all right?

23:27.482 --> 23:29.299
And we can't without you,
so snap out of it.

23:29.436 --> 23:31.305
I'm here.
I'll do whatever you need me to do.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.099
You really care, huh, suit?

23:35.266 --> 23:36.459
Yeah, I do.

23:37.300 --> 23:39.392
You know, you've never given me
a compliment before.

23:39.951 --> 23:41.144
I never knew you needed one.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.469
I do.

23:43.748 --> 23:45.189
And I need help with the ending.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.669
Please.

23:49.500 --> 23:50.585
It was a nice moment.

23:50.698 --> 23:52.802
Who would have thought
Billy would be so insecure?

23:52.893 --> 23:54.041
So I took care of it.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.819
I personally think
it was about the girl.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.672
But either way,
E got him to step out of it.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.537
I was the guy with her.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.262
I only got a hand job.

24:03.926 --> 24:05.200
But don't tell Billy.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.689
I'm still hoping
to get into the last scene.

24:08.958 --> 24:11.100
Drama? No shot.

24:11.300 --> 24:13.759
No shot, but please
bust out a polygraph machine.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.600
So we're all set?

24:16.300 --> 24:18.500
Oh, that's great.
That's great, thank you very much.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.264
Everyone!

24:23.305 --> 24:25.083
We got Stephen Gaghan
to rewrite our ending.

24:25.151 --> 24:26.289
Stephen fucking Gaghan.

24:34.703 --> 24:36.526
They got Steve fucking Gaghan?

24:37.800 --> 24:40.700
Stephen Gaghan?
Awesome.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.763
Damn, I'd love to hear
his words coming out of my mouth.

24:45.064 --> 24:47.113
So we fedexed Stephen
a check and a plane ticket.

24:47.203 --> 24:49.455
I was excited.
The guys seemed really passionate.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.200
I couldn't stop thinking about what
I was gonna tell stephen

24:52.300 --> 24:54.700
about what I was thinking.
All night I couldn't sleep.

24:55.300 --> 24:56.952
I started writing some ideas down.

24:57.516 --> 24:59.069
And I wrote and wrote and wrote.

24:59.700 --> 25:00.799
I was into it, you know?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.337
On the plane,
my ideas were flowing.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.300
You never know if you're going
to match up with a director.

25:06.910 --> 25:09.342
I woke up this morning
sitting at my typewriter.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.951
I had written all night.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.631
He rewrote the whole fucking script.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.100
- Billy, I love it.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.100
It's perfect.

25:18.253 --> 25:20.400
Hey boys, I'm excited to get into this.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.300
Did we pay this guy yet?

25:24.733 --> 25:26.669
- Billy walsh, our director.
- Steve.

25:30.700 --> 25:33.367
$275,000 down the drain.

25:33.527 --> 25:35.148
But I have to admit, the script is good.

25:35.257 --> 25:37.328
- No, it's great.
- It is great.

25:37.507 --> 25:40.499
And Gaghan was kind enough to read it
and agree before he headed back home.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.100
- Thank you so much.
- Hey, no problem.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.100
I've had people read
my work and not like it,

25:44.200 --> 25:46.900
but I've never
had anybody pay me not to work.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.197
It was nice, actually.

25:50.014 --> 25:52.029
FINAL DAY OF PRODUCTION (del vo)

25:52.277 --> 25:53.605
All right, this is our last shot.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.800
Probably the most complicated
of the whole shoot.

25:55.912 --> 25:57.392
And I'm not in it, which is nice.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.832
Which is why we're both
a little toasty right now.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.700
- What?
- You're gonna have to edit that out.

26:03.591 --> 26:05.257
So Eric, what's this scene?

26:05.700 --> 26:08.920
Okay, the army storms Pablo's hideout.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.837
Explosions go off
in the south, east and west.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.314
We have nine cameras
pointed at everything Billy wants.

26:14.395 --> 26:16.737
We've been prepping
this for three months. It has to work.

26:16.915 --> 26:19.392
- We can't do it twice.
- Okay, are you ready for this?

26:20.300 --> 26:22.139
Are we fucking ready?!

26:23.822 --> 26:25.196
Nobody sounds fucking ready.

26:25.300 --> 26:28.000
Hey, get that fucking camera off me.
I'll throw it in the water.

26:28.288 --> 26:29.324
He's nervous.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.926
Looks like he has it under control.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.347
You freaking?

26:34.500 --> 26:35.691
A little bit.

26:36.430 --> 26:39.300
- It's all good, Billy.
- Everything is prepared.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.100
If we get this shot, guys,
we got the whole movie in the can.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.241
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.641
Let's do it!

26:47.600 --> 26:48.797
Roll cameras!

26:50.900 --> 26:52.300
Set!
We're ready.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.848
Let's kill this motherfucker! (del vo)

27:49.800 --> 27:50.800
Cut!

27:53.500 --> 27:55.750
The start was off, suit.
I'm gonna need another one.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.401
I'm fucking with you.
It was perfect!

28:05.650 --> 28:07.767
- Guys, we did it.
- Yes, we did.

28:07.877 --> 28:10.151
Who would have thought
some kids from Queens could have?

28:10.152 --> 28:12.057
But we did,
and it's gonna be fucking amazing.

28:12.115 --> 28:15.000
I've never felt so good about a movie
after it was done than this one.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.019
I know it.

28:19.571 --> 28:20.900
You think you made a good film?

28:21.800 --> 28:22.800
I'll tell you this:

28:23.300 --> 28:25.795
it's either going to be genius or it's
going to fucking suck.

28:26.203 --> 28:28.100
Until I see the first cut,
I have no idea.

28:28.253 --> 28:31.300
But you know what?
Neither does anybody else.
