WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:03.569
(ALF)
'Yuck! Too ripe.'

00:05.272 --> 00:08.207
Nope, this one doesn't
look good either.

00:11.579 --> 00:12.611
Nope.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.814
This one has a worm in it.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.182
Mine!

00:17.184 --> 00:18.584
You eat worms?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.452
What else are you
supposed to do with them?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.488
Use them for bait?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.490
(Kate)
'Brian, time for dinner.'

00:24.492 --> 00:25.524
Okay.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.659
- You coming, ALF?
- No, go ahead.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.862
Your mother won't let
me eat worms in the house.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.731
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.370
There's no worm in this!

00:42.977 --> 00:45.244
Oh, howdy, Raquel.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.779
[screams]

00:53.654 --> 00:55.821
[screams]

00:56.957 --> 00:59.958
[theme music]

01:26.987 --> 01:29.988
[music continues]

01:59.286 --> 02:01.587
[instrumental music]

02:02.189 --> 02:03.689
[ALF screaming]

02:03.691 --> 02:06.425
Red alert! Red alert!
Alien coming through!

02:09.230 --> 02:11.096
What was ALF running for?

02:12.099 --> 02:13.265
(ALF)
'Uh, occupied!'

02:13.267 --> 02:15.634
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.970
ALF knows that's not a
bathroom, doesn't he?

02:17.972 --> 02:19.571
I hope so.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.040
ALF.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.075
ALF!

02:24.245 --> 02:26.979
Say, ALF, what's going on?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.046
[doorbell]

02:28.048 --> 02:30.048
Uh, uh, get the front door,
Willie.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.783
It may be self-evident.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.555
Oh, Kate, Willie!

02:36.557 --> 02:39.158
It was horrifying,
it was simply horrifying!

02:39.160 --> 02:41.093
It had a long...and two big..

02:41.095 --> 02:43.228
Raquel, please don't do this.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.930
She's imagining things.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.465
I am not imagining things.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.433
There is a monster
loose in the neighborhood.

02:48.435 --> 02:49.735
A monster?

02:49.737 --> 02:53.338
Oh, are you going to
form an angry mob?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.507
I saw it in your back yard.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.443
And I could swear I've
seen it once before.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.347
What did this monster look like?

03:02.349 --> 03:05.417
Uh...like bigfoot, only little.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.720
It ran behind your garage.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.589
Oh, it might still be there.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.791
Uh, maybe we should
go have a look.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.326
Oh, good, good, good.
But you go first.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.963
Uh, Raquel, Raquel, I'm sure
that there's nothing out there.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.766
Oh, fine! Well, then,
you just tell that to it!

03:23.337 --> 03:25.771
Raquel..

03:25.773 --> 03:28.974
Uh, will you tell it that
I'd like to speak to him.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.285
Big foot?

03:40.287 --> 03:41.887
Well, she's one to talk.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.690
I could shoot the rapids
in one of her gunboats.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.530
It was right over here!

03:51.532 --> 03:54.766
See. It was eating the avocados.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.936
How considerate of it to
have taken a single bite

03:57.938 --> 03:59.605
out of every one.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.273
Look at this bite pattern.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.307
Four teeth.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.343
That is not human.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.045
Your mother had four teeth.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.348
Bad example.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.117
Maybe it was a dog.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.119
It knew my name!

04:15.289 --> 04:18.156
Maybe-e-e it was a neighborhood
dog.

04:20.194 --> 04:23.028
Raquel, you know how the mind

04:23.030 --> 04:24.963
plays terrible
tricks on a person.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.432
Yeah, I bet it was
that extra garlic

04:27.434 --> 04:29.434
you put on your
pizza this morning.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.970
You had the pizza.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.372
Ixnay, Raquel.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.007
I'm just trying to cover for ya.

04:35.009 --> 04:38.710
I don't need you to cover for
me! I am telling the truth!

04:38.712 --> 04:41.980
Fine! You saw little bigfoot.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.215
I'm out of it.

04:43.217 --> 04:46.785
Well, it looked
like a little Bigfoot.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.554
Uh, uh, maybe it was one
of those, uh, you know

04:49.556 --> 04:51.223
wrinkly dogs from China.

04:51.225 --> 04:55.260
They're...a-always being
mistaken for something else.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.962
No, no, this was different.

04:56.964 --> 05:01.199
It looked like something
from...another world.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.802
The soap opera?

05:03.804 --> 05:08.573
No, it was a creature
from outer space!

05:08.575 --> 05:10.776
Willie, you went to college.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.978
Tell her there's no
such thing as spacemen.

05:14.415 --> 05:18.016
Well...I can't say
that for sure.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.953
It is possible that there
are beings from other worlds

05:21.955 --> 05:24.323
that could come
to visit us someday

05:24.325 --> 05:27.759
and stay even in fact overstay.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.829
Not even once offer to
pay for their own food..

05:34.101 --> 05:35.967
...so I hear.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.202
I give up. You're all nuts.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.804
Come on, Raquel.
We're going home.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.073
No, no, it may be dangerous.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.075
We must warn the
Alien Task Force.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.877
No, no. Why? You did that before
they didn't believe you.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.746
Why do you think
they'll believe you now?

05:47.748 --> 05:51.149
Fine! Then I'll have to
warn everybody myself.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.352
Yoo hoo!

05:53.354 --> 05:54.986
Mr. Litwak! Yoo-hoo!

05:54.988 --> 05:56.755
Raquel? Raquel!

05:56.757 --> 05:58.824
[indistinct chatter]

06:00.861 --> 06:02.260
Honey, you don't think the
Litwaks

06:02.262 --> 06:03.362
will believe her, do you?

06:03.364 --> 06:04.896
Kate, the Litwaks believe

06:04.898 --> 06:07.466
Dick Clark is 23 years old.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.669
[instrumental music]

06:11.572 --> 06:13.538
- Did they leave?
- Yeah.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.006
Where's small foot?

06:17.144 --> 06:19.945
What is this sudden
obsession with my feet?

06:23.450 --> 06:25.550
Brian, uh,
I want you to go outside

06:25.552 --> 06:27.919
and see if Mrs. Ochmonek
is alarming anyone.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.621
You want me to spy on her?

06:29.623 --> 06:32.023
No, no. No, no.
I want you to go outside.

06:32.025 --> 06:36.962
I want you to look around and
see if Mrs...uh, yeah, go spy.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.700
You know, I don't think that
Raquel is gonna rest

06:41.702 --> 06:43.935
until she gets her spaceman.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.670
What if we borrowed
a hairy animal

06:45.672 --> 06:47.506
and let it loose on her yard?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.474
Define hairy animal.

06:49.476 --> 06:50.709
A goat.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.577
An ant-rater.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.113
A baboon. Yeah, no.
No an orangutan.

06:55.115 --> 06:58.316
- That's orange.
- Who're you calling orange?

06:58.318 --> 07:00.185
I'm burnt sienna.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.854
I'm sorry ALF. No offense.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.456
Well, none taken.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.658
You hairless pink suburbanite.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.395
There's a crowd
around Mrs. Ochmonek.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.863
Oh, no!

07:11.865 --> 07:14.232
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll find a way out of this.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.536
In the meantime ALF,
you'll just have to stay inside.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.571
Well define meantime.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.173
For as long as it takes.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.608
Well, define
as long as it takes.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.177
Until Raquel forgets

07:25.179 --> 07:28.380
she saw a talking midget
Bigfoot with four teeth.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.684
Well, we're talking
well into next week.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.627
I noticed you spend a lot
of time fixing stuff, Willie.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.364
That's because you spend a lot
of time breaking stuff, ALF.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.669
Well, it's nice that our
hobbies are so compatible.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.410
Could you, could you
stop the pacing?

07:58.412 --> 07:59.978
I pace when I'm bored.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.381
I've been under house
arrest for almost a month.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.917
It's been two days, ALF.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.887
Then why did I carve 30
notches on your banister?

08:08.889 --> 08:11.089
Because you're a vandal.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.896
Look what I found.
It's a picture of ALF.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.965
What? Let me see.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.435
"Be on the lookout for this

08:23.437 --> 08:26.004
hideous looking space creature?"

08:26.006 --> 08:28.507
Well, if that isn't
a case of the orbit guard

08:28.509 --> 08:30.709
calling the
cat rancher a hairball!

08:32.012 --> 08:33.945
They're on all of
the telephone poles.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.881
Oh, no. This is terrible.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.917
Well, you're right! That picture
looks nothing like me.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.820
If my ears were that
big, I could pick up HBO.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.756
We've got to do something.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.959
Yes, Brian, go to all
the telephone poles

08:47.961 --> 08:49.528
and erase the ears.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.131
I repeat, erase the ears.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.500
Okay. I'll make the
nose bigger, too.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.207
[Brian loudly]
'Oh, hi, Mr. Ochmonek.'

09:02.209 --> 09:04.776
(Trevor)
'Oh, hi, Brian,
where's your dad?'

09:04.778 --> 09:08.713
[Brian loudly]
'He's in the garage.
All by himself!'

09:08.715 --> 09:12.784
[Trevor loudly]
'Well, thanks a lot!
See you later!'

09:13.820 --> 09:15.587
ALF, hide.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.290
No. It's time I took a stand.

09:18.292 --> 09:21.359
It is a far, far
better thing that I do.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.094
[knock at door]

09:23.096 --> 09:25.897
I'll be far, far under
the workbench.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.936
Oh, hey, Trevor, wh-what's up?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.939
Ask Raquel.
She's driving me nuts.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.974
You know she even made a
sculpture of the creature

09:35.976 --> 09:38.043
out of mashed potatoes.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.544
That is pretty bizarre.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.914
Hey watch it! That's my wife
you're talking about.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.983
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.088
This is a wild imagination,
that's all.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.656
She used to think
you guys were taking

09:51.658 --> 09:53.858
a sip out of our milk
every morning.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.601
She's making us the laughing
stock of the neighborhood.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.836
I hate to say it, Willie..

10:04.838 --> 10:06.471
...I think she's wacko.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.607
(Raquel)
Trevor? Trevor.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.908
Dumpling.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.377
I just got a call from the
"Lenny Scott Show."

10:12.379 --> 10:15.647
Lenny wants to interview
me on tonight's program.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.849
Oh, no, not Lenny Scott!

10:17.851 --> 10:19.551
Who's Lenny Scott?

10:19.553 --> 10:21.219
He has a local talk show.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.022
He has all kinds of kooks
and weirdoes on.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.859
He ridicules 'em,
then he makes fun of them.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.095
It doesn't matter
who ridicules you

10:30.097 --> 10:32.030
if you're telling the truth.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.632
I'm sorry, pumpkin.

10:33.634 --> 10:37.902
I just hate to see you blabbing
this thing all over the city.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.404
The truth must be told

10:39.406 --> 10:42.841
and finally someone wants
me to tell it. Oh!

10:42.843 --> 10:44.275
Not me.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.744
Me, either.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.911
Raquel!

10:46.913 --> 10:48.680
I'm on my knees.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.914
Don't do this!

10:49.916 --> 10:52.450
The name Ochmonek
always stood for class.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.524
And you were reincarnated
57 times?

10:59.526 --> 11:02.494
'I see, you're trying to break
Shirley MacLaine's record.'

11:02.496 --> 11:03.928
Is Raquel on yet?

11:03.930 --> 11:06.698
No, Lenny's still talking
to the fat lady.

11:06.700 --> 11:11.002
(Lenny)
'So, you were Lady Godiva
in a former life, huh?'

11:11.004 --> 11:13.872
Your horse must have loved that!

11:13.874 --> 11:16.207
How would you rate this guy
in the sleaze ball scale?

11:16.209 --> 11:19.244
Oh, somewhere between
a leech and a shark.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.146
(Lenny)
'We'll take our
first caller now.'

11:21.148 --> 11:23.181
'You're on the air.'

11:23.183 --> 11:24.049
Poor ALF.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.450
You realize that after tonight

11:25.452 --> 11:28.319
thousands of people will be
coming to look for him.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.655
I hope they don't take ALF away.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.491
Well, you hope they
don't take ALF away.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.194
How could you be eating
popcorn at a time like this?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.496
We're out of potato chips.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.231
Besides, I always snack

11:40.233 --> 11:42.901
when I'm going to
be exposed on TV.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.202
There she is.

11:44.204 --> 11:49.007
Our next guest is
Raquel Ouch-my-neck.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.479
[audience cheering
and applauding]

11:55.782 --> 11:57.215
Thank you.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.951
It's pronounced Ochmonek.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.087
Well, I'll just call you Raquel.

12:02.089 --> 12:05.290
So, what's your story, Raquel?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.426
Well, the other day..

12:08.428 --> 12:11.930
...I saw this in my
neighbor's back yard.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.399
[audience laughs]

12:15.435 --> 12:17.569
You saw a pile of
mashed potatoes?

12:18.638 --> 12:22.340
Hey, it's me, only lumpier.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.443
No, this is a model of the
space creature I saw.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.345
Oh.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.114
Must be from the planet Spud.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.182
[audience laughs]

12:31.184 --> 12:33.251
Well, I don't know what
planet it was from.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.589
But it spoke English.
It said, "Oh, howdy, Raquel."

12:37.591 --> 12:40.258
"Oh, howdy, Raquel?"

12:40.260 --> 12:42.560
Must be from the southern
part of the universe.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.899
Well, it sounds like you
had a close encounter

12:47.901 --> 12:49.768
of the "ya-hoo" kind, huh?

12:49.770 --> 12:52.203
[audience laughing]

12:52.205 --> 12:55.273
This is a great show, huh?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.174
No!

12:56.176 --> 12:58.176
ALF he's being mean.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.912
Really?
Well I didn't get that at all.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.413
Did you, Brian?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.115
Yes!

13:04.117 --> 13:07.519
Huh! I must've been
thrown off by his subtlety.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.756
Well..

13:11.758 --> 13:13.758
...look who just dropped in!

13:14.861 --> 13:16.628
It's Mr. Cuckoo.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.164
And he's chosen
you for his mate.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.033
Are you calling me cuckoo?

13:22.035 --> 13:25.270
Well, let's find out. Are you
calling her cuckoo, Mr. Cuckoo?

13:25.272 --> 13:26.971
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.108
[audience]
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.310
You're right! He is mean.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.412
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

13:34.414 --> 13:38.316
The kitchen. I'm going on
a hunger strike in protest.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.451
First, I'm gonna strike
the chocolate cake.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.787
Then, I'm gonna dive
bomb the cheese log.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.926
Tell me, Raquel.

13:47.928 --> 13:51.830
Uh, do you have any physical
proof about what you saw?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.498
Pictures? Footprints?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.700
An English-Martian dictionary?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.169
Just this.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.737
Is that one of it's eggs.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.439
No. No.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.375
The creature took a bite out
of that avocado, you see?

14:04.377 --> 14:07.812
Oh, no, it's the invasion of the
guacamole snatchers!

14:07.814 --> 14:08.847
Whoo!

14:08.849 --> 14:11.449
[audience laughing]

14:12.519 --> 14:14.686
You're making, a
re you making fun of me?

14:14.688 --> 14:17.188
I think, we'll take
our first caller.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.391
Oh, howdy.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.427
(ALF on speaker)
'Howdy, yourself.'

14:22.429 --> 14:25.797
'I wanna say that Mrs. Ochmonek
knows what she's talking about.'

14:27.534 --> 14:29.667
They're coming out of
the woodwork tonight.

'Aliens do exist.'

14:33.139 --> 14:35.540
'And they've visited
this planet many times.'

14:35.542 --> 14:38.476
'Although they
don't drink the water.'

14:38.478 --> 14:42.380
That voice...it
sounds so familiar.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.351
Folks, I'd like
to report a UFO.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.720
An unidentified flaky object.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.588
[audience laughing]

14:51.825 --> 14:54.392
Well, listen, I couldn't
help noticing your hair.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.762
Is that a toupee, or did
you sprout polyester?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.299
It's ALF. It's him.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.302
Hello? Hello?

15:05.906 --> 15:07.672
He hung up on me.

15:07.674 --> 15:11.042
ALF, what ever possessed
you to do such a thing?

15:11.044 --> 15:15.346
Hey, somebody had to defend
Mrs. Ochmonek's honor.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.583
Don't you realize what a
chance you were taking?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.818
Things were getting
out of hand, Kate.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.554
I just wanted to be
the voice of reason.

15:25.191 --> 15:28.893
You missed it, ALF. They just
voted you cuckoo of the week.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.128
Again?

15:37.704 --> 15:39.070
Where's Lizard taking you?

15:39.072 --> 15:41.072
Oh, to a science fiction movie.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.774
Something about this
guy being shrunk

15:42.776 --> 15:45.376
and then injected
into someone else.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.211
Oh, that's not science fiction.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.080
A friend of mine did that once.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.650
He took a wrong turn and
got stuck in the guy's nose.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.319
- ALF.
- Wait!

15:54.321 --> 15:56.988
I didn't tell you the
good part, how he got out.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.390
- See, what they had--
- We don't wanna know.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.695
- 'Hi, dad.'
- 'Hi, honey.'

16:03.697 --> 16:04.829
Hi, honey.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.833
What's the good word?

16:08.835 --> 16:10.902
Oh, well, the good word is, uh..

16:10.904 --> 16:13.237
...it looks like you're safe.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.407
Trevor's going around taking
down all the posters.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.110
Oh, heat's off?
I'll be at the beach.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.579
- ALF.
- Well, I've got sun block.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.582
You're staying right here.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.453
What's the bad word?

16:28.455 --> 16:29.620
Raquel.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.889
I feel just terrible for her.

16:31.891 --> 16:34.392
She's been so traumatized
by this whole experience

16:34.394 --> 16:36.027
that she-she won't
talk to anyone.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.530
She just sits in front the TV,
staring at the screen.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.898
How's Trevor handling it?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.800
Not very well.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.670
He said he wanted
to go out for a long walk

16:45.672 --> 16:48.573
Wanna search through
his feelings.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.641
Possibly bowl a few games.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.513
Isn't there something that we
could do for Mrs. Ochmonek?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.282
I'll go have a talk with her.

16:58.284 --> 17:01.085
Smart, spaceman. Real smart.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.154
I have to do something.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.356
The woman's a
turnip because of me.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.825
I'm afraid that's true.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.661
She, she thinks
she's lost her mind.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.797
But I do exist.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.400
I shed, therefore I am.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.903
What do you think we should do?

17:18.905 --> 17:21.839
Well, I don't know, honey.
Talk to her, be patient.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.409
Convince her that
she didn't see an alien.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.748
Well, let's face it.
I'm unforgettable.

Yo, Raquel, can you hear me?

18:23.403 --> 18:24.902
What's going on?

18:24.904 --> 18:26.404
Take it easy.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.373
I'm the alien you
saw the other day.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.577
You remember me,
Mr. Potato head?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.150
Oh, no. He's everywhere.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.886
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Spacemen don't exist.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.087
Everyone knows that.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.722
We do exist.

is to show you that

you're still running
on all three cylinders.

Oh. Oh, please don't
do this to me.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.334
I've just begun to
resume a normal life.

they're not real.
