01:17.826 --> 01:20.037
The Obyamywe Peninsula,

01:20.120 --> 01:24.625
a remote and fascinating region
teeming with extraordinary marine life.

01:25.250 --> 01:29.504
We chose its mysterious waters
as the Belafonte's next destination.

01:29.921 --> 01:32.758
In preparation for our voyage,
the members of Team Zissou

01:32.841 --> 01:37.054
gathered at my oceanographic
observatory here on Pescespada Island.

01:37.137 --> 01:40.265
This was to be our most
ambitious adventure to date,

01:40.349 --> 01:43.268
and ultimately a tragic one.

01:43.352 --> 01:46.855
Our team included Esteban du Plantier,
chief diver.

01:46.939 --> 01:50.526
Our senior statesman, my closest colleague for 27 years.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.321
Klaus Daimler, 40, engineer.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.531
Calm, collected, German.

01:55.615 --> 01:59.285
Vikram Ray, 28, cameraman.
Born on the Ganges.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.955
Bobby Ogata, 22, frogman.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.333
Renzo Pietro, 45, editor, soundman.

02:05.416 --> 02:09.461
Vladimir Wolodarsky, 33,
physicist, original score composer.

02:09.544 --> 02:12.632
Anne-Marie Sakowitz, 25,
script girl.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.885
Pele dos Santos, 30, safety expert.

02:17.136 --> 02:19.097
Eleanor Zissou, my wife,

02:19.180 --> 02:21.557
vice-president
of the Zissou Society.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.687
We'd also invited marine science students
from the University of North Alaska

02:25.770 --> 02:29.607
to accompany us as unpaid interns
in exchange for school credit.

02:31.776 --> 02:37.365
October 12th. Esteban and I explore
the blue reefs beyond the peninsula.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.578
Fluorescent snapper
unexpectedly appear in the shallows,

02:42.663 --> 02:44.456
extremely rare at this depth.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.512
Where's your gun?

02:58.637 --> 03:01.932
Steve? Steve?
Where's Esteban?

03:02.016 --> 03:03.350
Is that thing rolling, Vikram?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.989
Check the scanning monitor. Start
tracking it before it goes too deep!

03:17.072 --> 03:19.366
- Esteban was bitten?
- Eaten!

03:19.450 --> 03:21.118
Is he dead?

03:21.201 --> 03:23.746
- Esteban was eaten.
- He was swallowed whole?

03:23.829 --> 03:28.375
No! Chewed.
Check the scanning monitor!

03:28.500 --> 03:31.795
He's got hydrogen psychosis, "crazy eye".

03:31.879 --> 03:34.340
Steve, we think you got crazy eye.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.091
Get him out of the fucking water.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.426
Esteban!

03:37.509 --> 03:40.430
Esteban! Esteban!

03:40.513 --> 03:41.431
Esteban!

03:41.556 --> 03:42.557
Esteban!

03:42.641 --> 03:45.101
- Steve!
- Esteban!

03:45.226 --> 03:46.478
Esteban!

03:46.603 --> 03:47.854
Esteban!

03:47.938 --> 03:50.482
Esteban!

04:02.869 --> 04:07.999
Was it a deliberate choice
never to show the jaguar shark?

04:08.124 --> 04:09.834
No, I dropped the camera.

04:15.090 --> 04:17.634
Why are they laughing?

04:21.930 --> 04:24.599
Yes. What's next for Team Zissou?

04:24.683 --> 04:28.353
Well, that was only part one.
It's a cliffhanger.

04:28.436 --> 04:32.357
Now I'm gonna go hunt down that shark,
or whatever it is,

04:32.482 --> 04:35.152
and, hopefully, kill it.

04:36.153 --> 04:38.155
I don't know how yet.
Maybe dynamite.

04:38.948 --> 04:40.741
You don't know what it is?

04:40.825 --> 04:43.119
No, I've never seen anything like it
before in my life.

04:43.244 --> 04:46.163
You say it is a jaguar shark.
That's the title of your film.

04:46.247 --> 04:49.333
It was coming right at us. I just said
the first two words that came into my head.

04:52.670 --> 04:55.047
That's an endangered species at most.

04:55.131 --> 04:59.385
What would be
the scientific purpose of killing it?

05:02.388 --> 05:03.306
Revenge.

05:12.982 --> 05:15.943
Bravo! What fun.

05:16.027 --> 05:17.862
Steve, I'd like to introduce you
to Antonia Cook.

05:17.945 --> 05:20.573
She's the new head of the film society.

05:20.656 --> 05:24.577
- You must be so excited.
- I hope so. You think it went OK?

05:24.702 --> 05:28.040
No. Congratulations, seriously.

05:28.123 --> 05:32.628
Thanks. I wish it didn't require
the "seriously", but thank you.

05:32.711 --> 05:35.881
Well, I just don't think they got it.

05:35.964 --> 05:37.883
- Steve...
- Shit turnout tonight.

05:37.966 --> 05:40.177
..you know Larry Amin,
chairman of Saudifilm.

05:40.302 --> 05:41.303
Oh, yeah. Hi.

05:41.386 --> 05:43.513
Larry and I were discussing
our financial predicament.

05:43.597 --> 05:46.850
I thought it would be nice if the three of us
rode out to the party together.

05:46.975 --> 05:49.353
Why? Does Larry have
that kind of spending bread to invest?

05:49.478 --> 05:52.648
- The king's backing him now.
- I got $500 million capitalisation from him.

05:52.731 --> 05:54.858
Captain Zissou, can I get a shot of you
with Captain Hennessey?

05:54.983 --> 05:56.944
Where?

05:59.947 --> 06:01.615
Make it quick.

06:01.698 --> 06:03.825
Hey, Steven.
How's everything going with your...

06:03.951 --> 06:05.869
What are you calling it?
Leopard fish?

06:05.953 --> 06:09.623
- Jaguar shark.
- Jaguar shark, exactly.

06:09.748 --> 06:14.086
I love it.
Tell me something, does it actually exist?

06:14.169 --> 06:16.964
You know, Ali, I don't want
to give away the ending.

06:17.965 --> 06:19.132
Good man.

06:19.216 --> 06:21.760
Oh, here comes our girl.

06:25.056 --> 06:28.226
You're the most ravishing creature
that I've ever seen in my life.

06:28.309 --> 06:29.686
- Hello, skinny.
- Hello, Eleanor.

06:29.769 --> 06:31.813
Is that a new merit badge?

06:31.938 --> 06:33.439
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.

06:33.523 --> 06:37.652
I just became a knight in Portugal.
The presidente gave a special ball...

06:37.735 --> 06:41.406
Don't be nice to Ali.
He's my nemesis.

06:41.489 --> 06:43.408
How could you lay that slick faggot?

06:43.491 --> 06:46.160
Well, I was in love with him at the time.

06:46.244 --> 06:49.330
Yeah, he's charismatic.

06:49.414 --> 06:52.208
- How are you feeling?
- I'm right on the edge.

06:52.292 --> 06:54.252
I don't know what comes next.

06:54.377 --> 06:56.504
Wait here. I'll be right back.

07:00.508 --> 07:03.469
I just wanted to say hello. Hi.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.513
Hey, baby.

07:06.389 --> 07:11.352
I said I wanted to say hello.
I didn't say I wanted you to touch me.

07:11.436 --> 07:14.105
I'm here with my wife.
Eleanor, this is Mandeeza.

07:14.188 --> 07:16.941
Do we really want to put me through this?

07:18.986 --> 07:22.656
People say Eleanor
is the brains behind Team Zissou.

07:22.781 --> 07:24.992
What is Steve?

07:26.118 --> 07:28.412
He's the Zissou.

07:36.170 --> 07:39.423
Steve, this is my little nephew Werner.

07:39.506 --> 07:41.634
He wanted to meet you.

07:41.717 --> 07:45.554
- How you doing, Werner?
- He brought you a present.

07:47.389 --> 07:49.475
A crayon pony fish.

07:49.558 --> 07:51.560
Wow.

07:51.644 --> 07:54.188
Interesting specimen.

07:55.814 --> 07:58.651
- Thanks, pal.
- You're welcome.

07:58.734 --> 08:01.195
Steve...

08:01.320 --> 08:03.989
you don't look too good.

08:05.032 --> 08:06.825
How's this?

08:06.909 --> 08:10.120
Steve, there's a bloke over there
wants a word with you.

08:10.204 --> 08:11.288
What do you need, old man?

08:30.475 --> 08:32.434
How many of these do you have?

08:33.311 --> 08:37.774
All right, look, just forge
the rest of 'em yourself, all right?

08:39.943 --> 08:41.945
Get outta here.

09:02.215 --> 09:06.303
Hey, Steve, how come you're not
sitting shivah for your friend Esteban?

09:08.514 --> 09:10.474
What'd you say?

09:11.809 --> 09:14.270
Who you gonna kill in part two?

09:19.191 --> 09:20.568
Steve.

10:10.202 --> 10:13.872
Larry Amin's flying back to Mecca tonight,
to see if he can make the numbers work.

10:13.956 --> 10:16.875
He should have an answer for us in ten days.

10:16.959 --> 10:19.586
Tell him we need to know by Sunday.

10:19.670 --> 10:21.213
Why would I do that, my darling?

10:21.296 --> 10:25.133
To call his bluff, dammit,
to light a fire under his ass.

10:25.217 --> 10:28.136
My darling, we haven't made
a hit documentary in nine years.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.055
Let's not fuck with Larry Amin.

10:30.138 --> 10:32.224
- Doubles.
- Explain it to him, will you, Eleanor?

10:32.307 --> 10:33.809
- Screwdriver.
- He understands.

10:33.892 --> 10:36.353
Amin needs to make a projection
of the world grosses

10:36.478 --> 10:40.315
to see if he can get a tax break
and run it through his output deal.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.652
I don't understand, but I can tell it's bullshit.

10:43.735 --> 10:45.612
Oh, what the hell is going on?

10:45.696 --> 10:47.823
Play the black jack on the red queen.

10:50.534 --> 10:53.245
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go on an overnight drunk,

10:53.328 --> 10:57.457
and in ten days I'm gonna set out to find
the shark that ate my friend and destroy it.

10:57.541 --> 11:00.545
Anyone that would care to
join me is more than welcome.

11:04.424 --> 11:07.468
Captain Zissou, I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Ned Plimpton.

11:07.552 --> 11:09.846
OK, man.

11:09.971 --> 11:12.515
My mother's Katherine Plimpton.

11:16.227 --> 11:19.063
- You're kidding.
- No.

11:19.147 --> 11:22.025
- How is she?
- She died last month.

11:24.193 --> 11:26.654
I'm sorry. Shit.

11:27.447 --> 11:29.449
She was...

11:35.163 --> 11:37.123
I've heard of you.

11:45.757 --> 11:48.509
I don't know if it's true or not,
by the way. Do you?

11:48.593 --> 11:50.887
No, I don't.

11:51.012 --> 11:53.932
I haven't heard from her in 30 years.

11:55.643 --> 11:58.020
I guess it's too late now.

12:00.606 --> 12:04.109
She never contacted me, you know.

12:04.193 --> 12:06.153
Yes, I see.

12:09.823 --> 12:14.286
- You're supposed to be my son, right?
- I don't know.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.498
But I did want to meet you, just in case.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.251
I appreciate that.

12:28.133 --> 12:31.512
I'll be right back.
Don't go away?

13:24.983 --> 13:28.028
Sorry about that. You caught me with
one foot off the merry-go-round tonight.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.864
Oh, that's all right. I don't wanna
take up too much of your time.

13:30.947 --> 13:33.325
I wanna thank you for talking to me and...

13:33.408 --> 13:35.619
- We'll find a way, mate.
- I know we will.

13:35.702 --> 13:38.330
I just had a lovely chat with Si Perlman.

13:38.413 --> 13:41.333
He wants to make a big to-do
of the Oceanographic Explorer article,

13:41.416 --> 13:42.835
possibly give you the front cover,

13:42.918 --> 13:45.713
so do be nice to this girl
Miss Winslett-Richardson, won't you?

13:45.796 --> 13:50.760
Apparently she worships you,
and we dearly need the press.

13:50.885 --> 13:54.472
Oseary, this is probably my son Ned.
We just met.

13:54.597 --> 13:56.724
Ah. Oh, how delightful.

13:56.807 --> 13:58.559
Hello.

13:58.643 --> 14:02.563
Anyway, his mother just died.
Plus, we're having some problems.

14:02.688 --> 14:06.442
I just think it'd be a very special opportunity
for all of us, especially him.

14:06.567 --> 14:09.028
- He needs this deal.
- OK, bring him over.

14:09.153 --> 14:11.113
Well, he's right here.

14:15.618 --> 14:17.745
I'm sorry.
How do you do?

14:22.166 --> 14:25.920
- So what do you do?
- I'm a pilot. Air Kentucky.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.924
- Air Kentucky.
- Copilot, actually.

14:30.007 --> 14:32.802
- Yeah, I don't know that one.
- We hub out of Louisville.

14:32.885 --> 14:37.056
Sure, there's some pretty country
in those parts. Landlocked.

14:38.058 --> 14:43.438
I have to tell you, I've been a member
of the Zissou Society since I was 11.

14:43.522 --> 14:45.899
Well, I'll be damned.
Look at that.

14:48.151 --> 14:51.071
- Wanna kill this?
- Frankly, I'd better not.

14:51.154 --> 14:53.949
I don't usually try grass.

14:59.955 --> 15:02.332
Let me tell you about my boat.

15:08.547 --> 15:12.134
The Belafonte was a long-range
subhunter during the Second World War,

15:12.217 --> 15:15.721
which we bought from the U.S. Navy
for $900,000.

15:15.846 --> 15:20.434
This is my mentor, Lord Mandrake.
He's dead now.

15:21.727 --> 15:25.647
The sauna was designed by an engineer
from the Chinese space program,

15:25.731 --> 15:29.776
and we keep a Swedish masseuse on staff.

15:29.860 --> 15:35.700
Here's where we do all our science
projects and experiments and so on.

15:35.783 --> 15:37.785
This is the kitchen, which contains probably

15:37.869 --> 15:42.040
some of the most technologically
advanced equipment on the ship.

15:43.041 --> 15:45.710
Eleanor put together
a topnotch research library for us,

15:45.793 --> 15:50.673
with a complete first-edition set
of The Life Aquatic Companion Series.

15:50.798 --> 15:53.259
We process our own rushes
and keep a cutting room on board

15:53.343 --> 15:55.303
so we can do an assembly while we're shooting.

15:55.386 --> 15:58.431
- I can't find them.
- Once again, please.

16:00.141 --> 16:06.314
This is the observation bubble,
which I thought up in a dream, actually.

16:06.439 --> 16:08.733
Two albino scouts swim with the ship.

16:08.816 --> 16:13.947
They're supposedly very intelligent,
although I've never seen evidence of it.

16:14.030 --> 16:16.866
Here's the engine room. The bearing
casings aren't supposed to look like that,

16:16.950 --> 16:20.244
but we can't afford to fix 'em this year.

16:20.328 --> 16:23.039
Topside we've got the bridge,
the minisub, an old chopper

16:23.122 --> 16:27.377
and all kinds of radar and sonar
and underwater movie gadgets.

16:27.460 --> 16:30.464
What happened to "Jacqueline"?

16:30.547 --> 16:33.092
She didn't really love me.

16:44.895 --> 16:46.855
Lord Mandrake.

16:48.816 --> 16:51.944
It's wonderful. Very lifelike.

16:52.027 --> 16:54.029
I'm not crazy about it.

16:59.285 --> 17:03.580
This guy's a big-time asshole.
We were roommates at the academy.

17:03.664 --> 17:06.416
He used to be married to Eleanor.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.044
He hogs up all the grant money.

17:09.169 --> 17:12.256
You think you'll want to change your name?

17:12.339 --> 17:13.339
Ned?

17:13.464 --> 17:15.592
No, not the Ned part, unless you want to.

17:15.718 --> 17:21.015
I meant your last name. I thought
you might like to let me give you mine.

17:22.016 --> 17:24.810
- Ned Zissou?
- Ned Zissou. Exactly.

17:24.894 --> 17:27.105
Or if you want to,
you can change the first part, too.

17:27.230 --> 17:30.567
I would have named you Kingsley
if I'd had a say in it.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.360
Kingsley.

17:32.444 --> 17:36.197
I don't know.
Maybe I'll stick with Ned for now.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.657
Sure. That's OK.

17:37.741 --> 17:42.162
Anyway, I'll order you
some correspondence stock.

17:42.245 --> 17:44.289
What are you doing?
I ordered the wine.

17:44.372 --> 17:48.126
Pour it over here, please.
He doesn't know anything about wine.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.427
Are those assholes talking about me?

18:14.361 --> 18:16.655
People say, when someone says
something like that about you

18:16.780 --> 18:19.075
it's because they're jealous.

18:19.158 --> 18:22.828
But it still hurts.
It hurts bad.

18:22.954 --> 18:26.999
That man was damn rude.
He can go straight to hell.

18:43.432 --> 18:46.519
How did she die, by the way, your mother?

18:47.561 --> 18:51.315
She took her own life.
She took sleeping pills.

18:52.358 --> 18:55.152
Why would she do that?

18:55.236 --> 18:59.323
Well, she was in a great deal of pain, you know.

19:01.158 --> 19:03.160
I see, yeah.

19:04.829 --> 19:08.666
You know, my best friend just got killed.
Esteban.

19:08.791 --> 19:10.251
Yeah, I know.

19:10.334 --> 19:12.336
The old man.

19:15.257 --> 19:17.801
Let's go to my island.

19:17.884 --> 19:19.428
Well, I...

19:19.511 --> 19:22.264
I have to be back in Kentucky on Thursday.

19:22.347 --> 19:25.017
Thursday? OK.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.977
That's OK.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.433
Your cat's dead.

20:06.516 --> 20:09.062
- What? Which one?
- Marmalade.

20:09.187 --> 20:11.147
I'm sorry.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.524
What happened?

20:13.608 --> 20:16.486
A rattlesnake bit it in the throat.

20:18.029 --> 20:20.073
Goddammit, Eleanor,
why do you have to say it like that?

20:20.198 --> 20:24.035
You couldn't try to break it a little bit nicer?

20:29.123 --> 20:32.877
She's a rich bitch, you know.
She was raised by maids.

20:32.961 --> 20:37.757
Her parents paid for this island
and two of my worst movies.

20:39.175 --> 20:43.262
People say she's the brains behind Team Zissou.

20:43.346 --> 20:47.183
People say a lot of things.
What kind of cat was it?

20:48.184 --> 20:51.771
Who gives a shit?
I think it was a tabby.

20:51.854 --> 20:55.608
Ned? Wanna come inside,
we'll make up a room for you?

20:55.692 --> 20:58.152
Steve, that reporter called.

21:14.295 --> 21:18.382
Ned, wake up. I'm on the echo
box. Push the red button to answer.

21:18.465 --> 21:20.467
Throw on your slob and meet me on the beach in 12 minutes.

21:20.551 --> 21:22.636
The white button? OK.

21:26.348 --> 21:27.808
Action!

21:27.891 --> 21:32.646
Only twice before have I had
the good fortune to observe a "rubber tide",

21:32.730 --> 21:35.274
that rare occurrence
when hundreds of electric jellyfish

21:35.399 --> 21:38.235
spontaneously wash onto a beachhead at once.

21:38.319 --> 21:43.198
Bobby Ogata brings exactly this
to our attention tonight.

21:46.493 --> 21:48.787
Steve, what produces
this effect of illumination?

21:48.912 --> 21:52.291
Is there a chemical inside the organism?

21:53.459 --> 21:57.714
No, Ned. Actually, it's the reflection
of the moonlight on their outer membranes.

22:00.592 --> 22:03.595
That's a very good ad lib.

22:03.678 --> 22:05.889
Klaus, come over here
and get a two-shot of me and Ned.

22:06.014 --> 22:07.682
Ned, come in here.

22:12.228 --> 22:14.356
Would you like to join my crew?

22:15.398 --> 22:18.735
- Would I like to...
- I want you on Team Zissou.

22:18.860 --> 22:21.863
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

22:21.947 --> 22:25.367
Well, it's not my field.
I don't have the background for it.

22:25.450 --> 22:28.870
No one here does.
Klaus used to be a bus driver.

22:28.995 --> 22:31.539
Wolodarsky was a high-school
substitute teacher.

22:31.623 --> 22:33.833
We're a pack of strays.
Don't you get it?

22:33.917 --> 22:37.337
Steve, I'm not even that strong a swimmer.

22:39.839 --> 22:43.426
- The answer's yes.
- Well, it's got to be.

22:43.510 --> 22:45.303
I'll order you a red cap and a Speedo.

22:45.387 --> 22:48.098
Cut. Klaus, why aren't you rolling?

22:48.181 --> 22:49.975
Could I have a word with you, please?

22:50.558 --> 22:52.770
Why aren't you getting this?

22:53.813 --> 22:57.942
That was a goddamn tearjerker.
Why did you cut it, man?

22:58.025 --> 23:00.069
Because the sound is going to be shit.

23:00.194 --> 23:03.030
He doesn't even know how to hold a boom.

23:03.114 --> 23:05.741
He doesn't know diddly-jack
about what we're doing.

23:05.825 --> 23:08.744
Don't cut unless I say cut.

23:08.828 --> 23:12.748
I've never seen so many electric jellyfish
in all my life.

23:12.832 --> 23:14.834
Those are Vietcong man-of-wars.

23:24.385 --> 23:26.429
Oh, shit, she's right.

23:26.512 --> 23:29.140
I guess we'll have to loop that line.

23:29.223 --> 23:31.100
Where'd you come from?
You look pregnant.

23:31.183 --> 23:32.435
I am pregnant.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.687
I'm not even going to ask
what you men are doing out here

23:34.812 --> 23:36.689
in your matching pyjamas, by the way.

23:36.772 --> 23:40.610
We're producing a film, as a matter of fact.
Who are you?

23:40.735 --> 23:43.112
I'm Jane Winslett-Richardson.

23:43.237 --> 23:45.364
I'm the reporter from the Oceanographic Explorer.

23:45.489 --> 23:47.366
Oh, yeah, sure.
How'd you get out here?

23:47.491 --> 23:49.620
I hired some drunk in a fishing boat.

23:49.745 --> 23:53.040
That would take four hours.
Why would you do that?

23:53.123 --> 23:56.376
Because no one picked me up
at the effing airport.

23:56.501 --> 23:57.961
Jesus Christ, Klaus.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.756
One of my guys was supposed to do that.

24:00.839 --> 24:03.550
How long have you been working with Zissou?

24:03.634 --> 24:06.094
Uh, approximately...

24:06.219 --> 24:09.056
Only ten minutes, actually.
I was hired during the scene on the beach.

24:09.139 --> 24:12.184
- He's Steve's son, supposedly.
- You are?

24:12.267 --> 24:14.227
No, you're not.
He doesn't have one.

24:14.311 --> 24:16.438
Well, we're not 100% sure about that yet.

24:16.563 --> 24:19.024
We just met yesterday.

24:20.108 --> 24:23.070
Not this one, Klaus.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.660
You heard me. Not this one.

24:29.785 --> 24:31.411
OK.

24:31.495 --> 24:33.497
- First thing in the morning, huh?
- Just print everything?

24:33.580 --> 24:37.000
- Yeah, tell him to push it a stop and a half.
- OK.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.587
What are you gonna do with him?

24:40.671 --> 24:43.424
Who? Ned?

24:43.508 --> 24:45.510
What do you mean?

24:47.136 --> 24:49.931
I don't understand the question.

24:54.185 --> 24:57.438
I offered him a spot on the Belafonte.

24:57.563 --> 25:00.441
He didn't take it, did he?

25:00.525 --> 25:02.318
Of course he took it.

25:02.402 --> 25:04.862
We're gonna put him on the map, Eleanor.

25:04.946 --> 25:07.490
We're gonna throw him a life preserver.

25:07.573 --> 25:10.285
- I believe in this boy.
- Why?

25:14.580 --> 25:16.708
Because he looks up to me.

25:17.333 --> 25:21.087
Yes, sir, and McKinnon's willing
to take over my shuttle flights.

25:21.170 --> 25:23.131
That's right.

25:26.926 --> 25:31.055
Well, I just feel I need to
see this thing through, sir.

25:32.557 --> 25:37.061
Thank you for understanding. I'll check in
with the Louisville office again next month.

25:39.148 --> 25:42.568
"..as I have not, as they say,
enough power of observation

25:42.693 --> 25:44.653
to isolate their sense of colour."

25:44.778 --> 25:48.032
"For a long time afterwards,
whenever I thought of her,

25:48.115 --> 25:54.872
the memory of those bright eyes would at
once present itself to me as a vivid azure."

25:54.955 --> 25:58.208
"So much so that perhaps if
her eyes had not been quite so black,

25:58.292 --> 26:01.337
which was what struck one most forcibly
on first meeting her,

26:01.420 --> 26:03.547
I should not have been, as I was,

26:03.672 --> 26:06.759
so especially enamoured
of their imagined blue."

26:12.181 --> 26:13.432
Hold it.

26:17.311 --> 26:21.148
- That's poetry?
- No, it's a six-volume novel.

26:21.231 --> 26:24.193
Oh, so you're gonna read
that whole thing to yourself out loud.

26:24.276 --> 26:27.613
I'm not reading it to myself,
I'm reading it to him.

26:30.783 --> 26:33.161
When did you learn Zissou was your father?

26:34.871 --> 26:36.790
Does it freak you out for me to ask that?

26:36.873 --> 26:40.293
No, it doesn't, but it's a difficult question.

26:40.377 --> 26:42.587
I sort of pieced it together over the years.

26:42.712 --> 26:45.090
Well, how did he first contact you?

26:45.215 --> 26:49.135
He didn't. I went looking for him last month
after my mother died.

26:49.219 --> 26:52.973
She had ovarian cancer,
then it spread to her stomach and liver,

26:53.098 --> 26:54.808
and she took her own life.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.064
- Well, good night, I guess.
- Oh, good night.

27:02.023 --> 27:05.235
You mind if I stay and listen
for a little while?

27:07.529 --> 27:09.072
OK.

27:16.037 --> 27:18.581
Do you want me to catch you up on the story?

27:18.707 --> 27:21.543
No, I'll be able to figure it out.

27:21.626 --> 27:24.004
I'll just catch as catch can.

27:27.257 --> 27:30.511
They made these for about...
three and a half years

27:30.636 --> 27:32.847
before they terminated my sponsorship.

27:41.939 --> 27:43.441
These are great.

27:43.524 --> 27:45.985
- May I turn this on?
- Fire one.

27:48.779 --> 27:54.535
- So what happened, in your opinion?
- What are you talking about?

27:54.619 --> 27:58.539
Don't you think public perception of your
work has altered in the last five years?

27:58.623 --> 28:01.709
That's your first question? I thought
this was supposed to be a puff piece.

28:02.168 --> 28:04.879
- Should we come back to it?
- Yeah.

28:04.962 --> 28:06.631
OK.

28:07.381 --> 28:10.885
Is it true that this is going to be
your last voyage?

28:11.552 --> 28:13.596
Wow. No comment.

28:14.513 --> 28:17.058
Who told you that?

28:17.183 --> 28:20.227
No, goddammit. I'm only 52.

28:20.311 --> 28:23.148
How about we start out with some stock dialogue?

28:23.231 --> 28:26.902
You know, favourite colour... blue.
Favourite food... sardines.

28:26.985 --> 28:29.529
How do you feel about part one of your new film?

28:30.822 --> 28:33.283
Why? How do you feel
about part one of my new film?

28:33.367 --> 28:36.328
- Well, I'm honest, you know, so...
- Just say it.

28:38.580 --> 28:41.208
I thought aspects of it seemed slightly fake.

28:42.876 --> 28:43.794
Wolodarsky.

28:43.919 --> 28:47.130
- I'll take five, Steve.
- How about taking five?

28:49.007 --> 28:54.763
Did it seem fake when my best friend
was bitten in half right in front of me,

28:54.846 --> 28:57.057
then eaten alive, screaming?

28:58.058 --> 29:00.102
I think you're a fake.

29:00.227 --> 29:03.981
And I think you're a phony and a bad reporter.

29:04.106 --> 29:07.943
How does that feel?
Now tell me something...

29:08.026 --> 29:10.654
Does this seem fake?

29:10.737 --> 29:13.282
How dare you!

29:13.407 --> 29:17.244
This entire article was my idea.
No one else gives a shit.

29:17.369 --> 29:20.248
What about Si Perlman?

29:20.331 --> 29:23.209
Are you joking?
He's not even covering my expenses.

29:26.337 --> 29:28.381
You're taking something out on me.

29:37.265 --> 29:40.685
Stop crying.
What's the deal here?

29:40.810 --> 29:43.021
I was only trying to defend myself.

29:43.104 --> 29:45.315
Well, you did a great job.

29:45.982 --> 29:48.526
I'm sure you'll make a terrific father.

29:55.199 --> 29:58.703
So... you really think you're a Zissou?

30:00.913 --> 30:02.540
I don't know.

30:02.624 --> 30:06.461
You travelled a long way
for "I don't know", sonny.

30:06.544 --> 30:10.298
That's true, but it's important to me.

30:10.423 --> 30:15.220
Ja. well, there are a lot of things that are
important to people around here, sonny.

30:15.346 --> 30:18.223
- Klaus, don't call me sonny.
- One more thing.

30:18.307 --> 30:21.727
It's the Steve Zissou show, not the Ned show.

30:24.813 --> 30:28.317
- You hear me?
- Yes, I do.

30:29.568 --> 30:30.903
Klaus!

30:30.986 --> 30:32.071
Ja?

30:32.196 --> 30:34.490
If you ever touch me again,

30:34.615 --> 30:38.535
I will kick your goddamned teeth out,
is that understood?

30:40.120 --> 30:43.082
Not if I don't see you first, sonny.

30:53.134 --> 30:55.929
We gotta watch ourselves
around this Jane character.

30:56.012 --> 30:57.973
Don't tell her anything personal.

30:58.098 --> 31:02.436
If you're not sure about something,
change the subject and look for me.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.357
This bull dyke's got something against us.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.443
I don't think she's a lesbian.
She's pregnant.

31:09.527 --> 31:12.071
Bull dykes can get pregnant.

31:12.196 --> 31:15.951
Anyway, I'd back out now, but we need the press.

31:16.076 --> 31:18.078
See you in the morning.

31:18.996 --> 31:20.330
Steve?

31:22.708 --> 31:25.669
When'd you first hear about me?

31:27.588 --> 31:32.468
About five years ago.
I read it in an article about myself.

31:33.386 --> 31:35.596
Did you believe it?

31:36.472 --> 31:40.394
It was in the paper.
I assumed they... checked their facts.

31:43.439 --> 31:46.191
Why didn't you contact me?

31:48.527 --> 31:52.740
Because I hate fathers,
and I never wanted to be one.

32:00.999 --> 32:04.669
I forgot.
Your correspondence stock came in.

32:12.386 --> 32:14.680
Hi, Ross. Started today.

32:14.764 --> 32:19.018
I'll forward some pages to you
through the copy department.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.858
You're probably right, though.

32:24.941 --> 32:27.694
What am I doing here?

32:28.654 --> 32:31.198
I miss you and...

32:31.281 --> 32:34.077
Oh, God, I don't know, Ross.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.287
Where are you?

32:39.832 --> 32:42.460
Listen, I'm not leaving this message.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.922
Don't even know why I'm still pregnant.

32:54.848 --> 32:58.352
The script girl uses these for continuity.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.230
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no.

33:00.313 --> 33:02.524
No exceptions.
Everyone gets one.

33:02.649 --> 33:06.236
Anne-Marie,
do the interns get Glocks?

33:07.237 --> 33:09.698
No, they all share one.

33:09.781 --> 33:11.992
Take it, Ned.

33:12.075 --> 33:13.869
- Steve!
- What?

33:13.953 --> 33:16.163
Whack on the echo box.

33:17.999 --> 33:22.962
- Zissou here.
- Oseary Drakoulias on line two.

33:23.963 --> 33:24.880
Yeah?

33:25.006 --> 33:28.760
I spoke with Larry Amin, and it's a pass.

33:28.844 --> 33:31.555
In other words, you fucked us.

33:31.638 --> 33:34.599
Let's not cast stones at one another, my boy.

33:34.683 --> 33:37.352
- Do you hear me, dammit? Do you?
- No, I don't!

33:37.436 --> 33:40.231
- I told you how to play it!
- Bloody hell. Listen here, mate...

33:40.315 --> 33:42.692
May I interrupt for a moment?

33:43.693 --> 33:47.196
- Who the blazes is that?
- It's me, Ned.

33:47.322 --> 33:49.782
Maybe this is nothing, maybe it's something.

33:49.907 --> 33:53.912
I don't know your problems.
I don't know...

33:53.996 --> 33:57.583
But I just inherited $ 275,000.

33:57.666 --> 34:00.502
Would that amount make any difference?

34:01.503 --> 34:04.548
What sort of expression
is the lad wearing on his face?

34:05.049 --> 34:07.093
Can you fly a chopper?

34:07.218 --> 34:11.222
I have, but I'm certainly not licensed
in any way, shape or form.

34:11.306 --> 34:13.683
Great. Let's go.

34:21.942 --> 34:23.985
When was this whirlybird last serviced?

34:24.070 --> 34:27.572
I don't know. Klaus is supposed
to check it every six months.

34:35.415 --> 34:39.585
You're back on the water, boys. The wire
transfer came through from Kentucky,

34:39.670 --> 34:42.797
and Jackman and Wordsley
are going to gap-finance the rest.

34:42.880 --> 34:47.344
But we have a few hooks on it,
so take a pew for a spell.

34:47.428 --> 34:50.806
Number one, the bank want a drug screen
for everyone on the crew

34:50.889 --> 34:52.141
before they'll forward the money.

34:52.266 --> 34:54.560
- A piss test?
- Yes, a piss test.

34:54.643 --> 34:56.938
Two, a stooge from the bond company

34:57.021 --> 35:00.943
will be riding everywhere during
the whole shoot to keep you on budget.

35:01.026 --> 35:03.904
- Who's the stooge?
- A chap by the name of Bill Ubell.

35:03.988 --> 35:06.365
And there's not a damn thing
you can do about that, Steve.

35:06.448 --> 35:09.118
Three, you must swear, legally swear,

35:09.201 --> 35:11.745
that you'll not kill that shark,
or whatever it is,

35:11.829 --> 35:13.707
if it actually exists.

35:16.001 --> 35:18.795
I'm going to fight it, but I'll let it live.

35:18.878 --> 35:21.548
- What about my dynamite?
- Phillip, dynamite.

35:21.631 --> 35:24.759
I'm off to Zurich.
Follow me, chaps.

35:24.843 --> 35:29.890
Mr Ubell, I'd like for you to know
Steve Zissou and our equity partner Ned.

35:37.773 --> 35:41.778
I hope you're not gonna bust our chops, Bill.

35:41.862 --> 35:47.576
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're a bond-company stooge.

35:47.659 --> 35:50.037
Well, I'm also a human being.

35:51.330 --> 35:53.458
All right, I take that back.

35:53.541 --> 35:55.001
Yeah.

35:56.002 --> 35:58.546
Let's have some teamsmanship.

36:02.550 --> 36:04.594
Ho!

37:36.735 --> 37:37.819
1, 2, 3.

37:37.902 --> 37:39.905
Come on.

37:45.953 --> 37:47.538
1, 2, 3.

37:47.621 --> 37:48.998
Attaboy. Attaboy.

37:49.081 --> 37:51.292
Here he is. Here he is.
Come on.

37:51.375 --> 37:53.420
You OK, Ned? You OK?

37:54.463 --> 37:56.506
All right, give him some room.
He's OK.

37:56.590 --> 37:59.634
He just drank a little too much water.

38:03.388 --> 38:05.516
How are you shooting this,
Vikram? Wide open?

38:05.600 --> 38:07.602
Light, 5/6.

38:19.990 --> 38:22.785
As always, even in
the most challenging circumstances,

38:22.868 --> 38:27.164
the members of Team Zissou
find ways to keep morale high.

38:32.045 --> 38:33.380
Wait. Hold it.

38:33.463 --> 38:35.465
Is that a distress bark?

38:39.511 --> 38:41.471
Is something wounded out there?

38:41.596 --> 38:45.976
We quickly locate the source of the mysterious cry.

38:48.062 --> 38:51.649
- What is she, Steve?
- A wild snow mongoose.

38:51.774 --> 38:54.860
We thought they were extinct.
Her ankle's broken.

38:54.944 --> 38:56.320
- Ogata?
- Yeah.

38:56.404 --> 38:59.741
Run and get some hot milk
and put these guys in the incubator.

38:59.825 --> 39:04.538
We radio for the emergency
transport of our rare beautiful new friends.

39:07.124 --> 39:09.668
That's what it used to be like.

39:22.223 --> 39:27.271
Had Ned's heart stopped beating
before you pulled him out of the water?

39:27.396 --> 39:31.608
Had Ned's heart stopped beating
before we pulled him out of the water?

39:31.692 --> 39:35.362
Yes. But we got him
started again pretty quickly.

39:35.487 --> 39:38.450
Don't go on this voyage right now, Steve.

39:38.533 --> 39:40.994
One of you is already dead, after all.

39:41.119 --> 39:42.620
Who?

39:44.998 --> 39:46.624
Oh, you mean Esteban?

39:46.708 --> 39:49.169
Thanks for bringing that up.

39:52.631 --> 39:55.843
Who's gonna tell us the Latin names
of all the fishes and everything?

39:55.926 --> 39:58.137
You know I can't remember all that shit.

39:58.220 --> 40:00.681
Please stop, Eleanor.
Eleanor, stop.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.099
Why are you leaving?

40:02.183 --> 40:04.936
I don't want to be a part of
whatever's gonna happen out there.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.314
Nobody knows what's going to happen,
and then we film it.

40:07.397 --> 40:10.734
- That's the whole concept.
- That's how we've always done it.

40:11.193 --> 40:13.945
I can't believe you took that boy's money.

40:14.029 --> 40:15.989
He's an investor.

40:16.323 --> 40:18.701
He's my sidekick.

40:19.327 --> 40:21.621
The sugar crabs are back.

40:23.539 --> 40:25.667
They're early this year.

40:25.750 --> 40:29.087
I've never seen them mating before the solstice.

40:29.212 --> 40:31.757
Is that mating?

40:38.013 --> 40:39.973
Goodbye, Steve.

40:41.600 --> 40:45.438
Don't say that.
Even if it's true... don't say that.

40:45.563 --> 40:49.150
- It's too painful.
- What do you want me to say?

40:51.361 --> 40:53.321
Say bon voyage.

40:57.952 --> 40:59.954
Bon voyage.

41:38.537 --> 41:40.497
Kingsley Ned Zissou, 29,

41:40.622 --> 41:43.083
junior-grade diving tech,
executive producer.

41:43.208 --> 41:45.336
Energetic, spirited, youthful.

41:48.172 --> 41:52.886
Normally we would track the jaguar shark
with the scanning monitor,

41:52.969 --> 41:56.890
but its power tubes have seized up
and blown a gasket.

41:58.016 --> 42:03.605
We proceed to the more advanced system
located on a colleague's offshore facility.

42:05.649 --> 42:08.736
This will be Team Zissou's next stop.

42:14.075 --> 42:17.746
See, Renzo, this is what I'm talking about -
a relationship subplot.

42:17.829 --> 42:20.957
There's chemistry between us, you know?

42:23.835 --> 42:25.712
- Here's a quote.
- Wait. Who from?

42:25.837 --> 42:29.424
"Zissou has an almost magical connection
to the life of the sea."

42:29.508 --> 42:35.181
"He speaks its language fluently.
I've never met a boy like that in all my life."

42:35.264 --> 42:38.601
- Lord Mandrake.
- You should have opened with that one.

42:38.685 --> 42:42.855
- He was your mentor.
- Hey, intern, get me a Campari, will ya?

42:42.939 --> 42:45.651
On the rocks?

42:46.735 --> 42:48.779
You wanna go up in my balloon?

42:51.615 --> 42:56.328
- I like her hairdo.
- Me too, but Steve called it first.

43:00.166 --> 43:03.920
- I'm sorry I made you cry the other day.
- Oh.

43:04.004 --> 43:06.923
That's OK. It's not completely
your fault anyway.

43:07.007 --> 43:09.551
I'm going through some personal problems.

43:09.634 --> 43:11.679
Really? What do you got?

43:11.804 --> 43:15.641
Well, I'm... five months pregnant.
My editor's the father.

43:15.766 --> 43:19.812
He's married, but... not to me.

43:19.895 --> 43:22.940
Wow. That's a rough ticket.

43:23.024 --> 43:26.862
You know, my first wife left me
when I was your age.

43:29.656 --> 43:32.409
- What's Deep Search?
- My submarine.

43:35.245 --> 43:39.959
I had this image of you on the wall above
my aquarium all through primary school.

43:40.043 --> 43:44.839
Oh, yeah? You mean the official
photograph, where I'm doing this?

43:44.922 --> 43:47.592
That's the one.

43:47.675 --> 43:51.513
Well, maybe it's just me,
but I don't feel like that person.

43:51.638 --> 43:53.766
I never did.

44:06.988 --> 44:09.282
Why did you abandon Ned?

44:11.326 --> 44:14.037
I didn't. I never even met him.

44:17.165 --> 44:20.586
What kind of piece are you writing, cubbie?

44:21.045 --> 44:23.005
Are you gonna screw us on this deal?

44:24.590 --> 44:27.218
I hope not.

44:33.392 --> 44:38.980
You really think it's cool to hit the sauce
when you got a bun in the oven?

44:39.064 --> 44:41.274
Pele, bring us back down, please.

44:46.364 --> 44:49.200
I don't have a problem with objective reporting.

44:49.283 --> 44:52.495
What I have a problem with
is some wombat coming on my boat,

44:52.578 --> 44:58.585
trying to railroad me. Why don't you see
if you can get one of these dolphins

44:58.669 --> 45:02.006
to swim under the hull and give us a look.

45:10.432 --> 45:14.477
Nah. Either they can't hear us,
or they don't understand.

45:15.979 --> 45:18.982
Son of a bitch. I'm sick of these dolphins.

45:21.484 --> 45:23.863
Quiet out there tonight.

45:23.946 --> 45:27.950
Can you hear the jack whales singing?

45:28.034 --> 45:30.786
Beautiful. I wonder what they're saying.

45:30.870 --> 45:33.956
That was the sludge tanker, but...

45:34.040 --> 45:36.792
There you go. That's them.

45:40.255 --> 45:45.052
By the way, would you mind if I made a few
modifications to the Team Zissou insignia?

45:45.135 --> 45:47.262
- I have some ideas.
- You mean the patch?

45:47.387 --> 45:49.514
Yes. The insignia.

45:49.598 --> 45:52.810
Yeah. It's probably kind of dated, isn't it?

45:52.894 --> 45:55.897
Sure. Take a crack at it.
Make it a little trendier.

45:57.899 --> 46:00.276
All right.

46:02.070 --> 46:07.534
Are you finding what you were looking for
out here with me?

46:07.618 --> 46:09.828
I hope so.

46:11.455 --> 46:14.249
I wrote you a letter about 17 years ago.

46:16.043 --> 46:18.922
You mean like a fan letter?

46:19.881 --> 46:22.092
Did I write you back?

46:22.217 --> 46:25.303
I try to answer as many personally as I can.

46:25.387 --> 46:29.391
"Dear Ned Plimpton, first,
in answer to your question - always."

46:29.474 --> 46:32.728
"Second, thank you very much
for naming your bug after me."

46:32.853 --> 46:35.690
"My wife tells me
it is actually a type of gnat."

46:35.773 --> 46:40.152
"You strike me as a very special boy
and a key member of the Zissou Society."

46:40.236 --> 46:44.533
"I wish I could come visit you in Kentucky
and assist you with your work."

46:44.616 --> 46:48.370
"I remember your mother.
Take care of yourself, Ned Plimpton."

46:48.453 --> 46:51.873
"You've served well.
Your friend, Captain Steve Zissou."

46:51.998 --> 46:54.459
"Dictated but not read."

46:57.880 --> 47:01.300
Yeah, more or less
standard boilerplate, I guess.

47:03.594 --> 47:07.098
There's some real high-tech gear
inside this deal, believe me.

47:07.181 --> 47:11.979
First we turn on that tracking system, then
as long as the batteries haven't gone...

47:12.104 --> 47:15.441
- Who locked us out?
- No one. We're trespassing.

47:15.566 --> 47:19.653
- Steve, are we allowed in here?
- It's a scientific community, man.

47:19.737 --> 47:24.284
Captain, I am required by law to notify
the bank of any illegal activities.

47:24.409 --> 47:27.162
Just do what you gotta do
to cover your ass, Bill.

47:27.245 --> 47:29.205
Got it.

47:36.379 --> 47:40.051
Fuck! They wired it. Klaus, go down
and get me some cable snippers.

47:40.176 --> 47:44.096
This is Captain Hennessey.
You have trespassed on a private facility.

47:44.180 --> 47:46.557
The Coast Guard is being alerted.

47:46.640 --> 47:49.853
Again, this is Captain Hennessey.
Immediately leave...

47:53.482 --> 47:56.818
OK, action. Well, look who's back in town.

47:56.902 --> 48:00.238
You travelled over 150 miles since we last heard from you.

48:00.322 --> 48:02.449
It's heading for the South Pacific.

48:03.701 --> 48:05.036
Turn on your tape recorder.

48:05.119 --> 48:08.498
- Is it the jaguar shark?
- On the record, yes.

48:08.581 --> 48:11.250
Cut. Print both takes, Vikram.

48:11.334 --> 48:15.463
- Was I just in the film?
- Yeah. You have to sign a release.

48:15.546 --> 48:17.925
But you've actually located the shark.

48:18.008 --> 48:21.053
You better bet your ass we did.
All right, everybody,

48:21.136 --> 48:24.890
we got about 25-30 minutes before
the Coast Guard gets here to arrest us.

48:24.973 --> 48:28.894
I want you all to get Hennessey's
best gear onto the Belafonte in 15.

48:29.019 --> 48:32.440
- You're gonna steal his stuff?
- We'll get it back to him. Interns,

48:32.524 --> 48:34.567
let's see some hustle.

48:34.651 --> 48:37.195
Uh, what is this, Pele?

48:38.196 --> 48:40.198
I don't know. Uh, it's a map.

48:40.281 --> 48:42.659
Steve.

48:42.784 --> 48:46.455
Do you know you just charted us on
a course through unprotected waters?

48:46.539 --> 48:50.793
- Yeah, we're taking the shortcut.
- But it's outside IMU jurisdiction.

48:50.876 --> 48:52.878
I know, honey. Look at the map.

48:52.962 --> 48:58.176
We go your way, that's about... 4 inches.
We go my way, it's an inch and a half.

48:58.301 --> 49:01.888
- You wanna pay for the extra gas?
- What kind of system is this?

49:02.013 --> 49:04.933
You have the Bernstein 9.
Just upgraded last summer.

49:05.016 --> 49:08.603
- The nines are out already?
- Does this do cappuccino?

49:08.687 --> 49:11.065
- Ja.
- Wait. This isn't the procedure.

49:14.068 --> 49:17.655
One of the interns just fell down the stairs
with the tracking processor.

49:17.739 --> 49:21.826
- Make sure we steal the backup.
- You listening? Under no circumstances...

49:21.909 --> 49:24.621
Shut up before you jinx us, Anne-Marie.

49:39.304 --> 49:41.681
You catching anything?

49:45.477 --> 49:47.854
Hook this up and make me a latte.

49:53.486 --> 49:56.572
You know, Cubbie's kind of a suckermaker,

49:56.655 --> 49:59.325
but she's got some moves.

49:59.408 --> 50:01.619
I agree.

50:01.702 --> 50:06.583
If she wasn't a bull dyke, I think
I might have a bit of a thing for her.

50:18.930 --> 50:23.559
As you can see, if the creature continues
its current migratory route,

50:23.684 --> 50:26.312
our paths should converge
in less than four days.

50:26.396 --> 50:31.068
- I wanna get there in three. Can we?
- Vladimir, what's this blip here?

50:31.151 --> 50:34.488
I don't know.
We might have them mixed up.

50:34.571 --> 50:39.076
It could be the other way around. Anyway,
we're gonna be on top of it in the morning.

50:42.454 --> 50:47.419
- Good eye, Ned.
- Thank you. Should we investigate it?

50:47.544 --> 50:51.047
Yeah. Let's make a dive at 6am,
scope out the phantom signal.

50:51.131 --> 50:56.345
It's probably one of Hennessey's turtles.
I wanna be back on the road by lunch.

50:59.974 --> 51:03.561
Do me a favour. Next time you get
a hot idea in front of the reporter,

51:03.644 --> 51:05.771
whisper it in my ear first.

51:05.855 --> 51:08.983
Otherwise I look like kind of
a daydream Johnny, you know?

51:09.066 --> 51:11.611
Daydream Johnny, yes.

51:11.737 --> 51:13.613
You let him change your name?

51:14.114 --> 51:17.784
- Well, we changed it together.
- What was it before?

51:17.868 --> 51:20.620
- Edward Plimpton.
- That's a million times better.

51:20.704 --> 51:25.001
Change it back, Ned.
I really don't see you as a Kingsley Zissou.

51:25.084 --> 51:29.088
Do you think Steve and I
have a family resemblance?

51:29.172 --> 51:31.382
No.

51:31.466 --> 51:34.010
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway.

51:40.142 --> 51:42.269
Here.

51:42.352 --> 51:47.566
I stole it back... and strung it
on some peppermint dental floss

51:47.691 --> 51:50.695
in case you want to wear it like a necklace.

52:11.675 --> 52:14.845
- Happy with the piece, Jane?
- What are you doing in here?

52:14.929 --> 52:17.307
Am I? No.

52:17.391 --> 52:20.352
- Put that down.
- I assume I'm Mr Z.

52:20.435 --> 52:26.691
I'm sorry that you think my red hat is, uh...
What's the word you use? "Contrived."

52:26.817 --> 52:28.861
And that...

52:28.945 --> 52:34.784
"The Zissou of my childhood represents
all the dreams I've come to regret"?

52:34.867 --> 52:39.288
- What? Why?
- I have to start locking my effing door.

52:39.372 --> 52:44.253
It was locked. I kicked it in. Why don't
you just curse, like other people?

52:44.336 --> 52:47.840
I'm trying to get out of the habit
before I have my fucking baby.

52:47.965 --> 52:52.177
OK. That makes sense.
Well, please clean up your room, anyway.

52:52.261 --> 52:55.849
- It looks like a goddamn typhoon hit it.
- Oh, get out.

53:02.814 --> 53:06.860
Please don't make fun of me.
I just wanted to flirt with you.

53:06.943 --> 53:09.655
I'll have an intern come and fix the door.

53:23.003 --> 53:25.005
This is a message from the IMU Coast Guard.

53:25.088 --> 53:28.925
Apparently some crooked fuckers
broke into my Sealab yesterday.

53:29.009 --> 53:31.136
How awful. Did they nick anything?

53:31.261 --> 53:35.892
It doesn't say. Probably just trashed
the place. I'm so... pissed, I wanna spit.

53:35.975 --> 53:40.605
Hugo... Tell Carl to load
my elephant gun with buckshot.

53:42.774 --> 53:45.234
We're gonna hunt down these sickos.

53:47.820 --> 53:50.699
Supposedly, Cousteau and his cronies
invented the idea

53:50.783 --> 53:53.160
of putting walkie-talkies into the helmet,

53:53.243 --> 53:58.290
but we made ours with a special rabbit ear
on the top so we could pipe in some music.

54:44.507 --> 54:47.677
Let's start with the reverse.

54:57.354 --> 54:59.481
OK, roll it, Vikram.

55:01.316 --> 55:05.320
Would it be possible for me to address
you as "Dad" in this scene?

55:05.404 --> 55:07.614
No. Why?

55:09.367 --> 55:12.537
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
I forgot. I'm sorry.

55:12.620 --> 55:15.623
Where you coming from, jack-off? Shit.

55:16.499 --> 55:20.003
It's not a bad impulse, though,
some kind of nickname.

55:21.045 --> 55:25.718
Not that one. It's too specific.
But try to think of something else.

55:26.552 --> 55:29.096
Another name?

55:29.805 --> 55:32.266
How about "Stevesie"?

55:32.349 --> 55:35.395
That's good. Try it.
What were you gonna say before?

55:38.523 --> 55:42.444
- Good luck, Stevesie.
- Fantastic. Let's go.

55:51.162 --> 55:53.456
OK, action.

55:59.378 --> 56:02.007
Look, Ned, there's a sunken airplane down there.

56:02.091 --> 56:04.385
Let's check it out.

56:13.560 --> 56:19.484
We examine the site but are careful not to
disturb forensic evidence. How was that?

56:19.567 --> 56:22.195
Not bad.
The first take was a little faster.

56:23.321 --> 56:25.281
Is it loose?

56:25.407 --> 56:27.867
- Klaus. Klaus?
- Ja.

56:27.992 --> 56:30.454
May I have a word with you, please?

56:33.874 --> 56:35.543
What?

56:36.377 --> 56:38.587
- Why'd you do that?
- I owed you one.

56:38.712 --> 56:41.508
But you gave me a warning already.

56:41.591 --> 56:44.720
- You stood up for yourself.
- I still owed you one.

56:44.803 --> 56:48.306
- Now I owe you one.
- No. Now we're even.

56:48.432 --> 56:53.478
Why are you doing this? He's not
my father, you know. I don't have that.

56:53.603 --> 56:58.985
- What are you talkin' about?
- We're even, dammit. That's it!

57:18.464 --> 57:23.094
No, it was like a beat-up little jalopy.
I don't know what you'd call it.

57:23.219 --> 57:26.556
- You didn't see it?
- I didn't see it, boss.

57:26.639 --> 57:30.018
Well, keep your eyes peeled.

57:30.101 --> 57:33.188
Klaus, check who's on watch.
I'll be in the sauna.

57:34.439 --> 57:36.734
Pele and...

57:36.859 --> 57:39.653
Who the shit is Kingsley Zissou?

57:41.655 --> 57:44.033
- Is that him?
- That's him.

57:45.534 --> 57:49.039
I've never felt a baby
in someone's stomach before.

57:52.667 --> 57:55.879
I think you'll make a very good single mother.

57:59.132 --> 58:01.427
- Thanks.
- Although it does put you both

58:01.511 --> 58:03.888
at a tremendous disadvantage.

58:20.280 --> 58:22.658
You know...

58:22.783 --> 58:25.577
Steve's got a little bit of a thing for you.

58:26.912 --> 58:29.040
Why do you say that?

58:29.165 --> 58:31.292
Because he told me.

58:31.376 --> 58:32.877
Really?

58:32.961 --> 58:36.256
I thought he hated my guts.

58:36.339 --> 58:38.716
Well, I think you hurt his feelings, but...

58:38.842 --> 58:41.053
He says I hurt his feelings?

58:43.681 --> 58:47.852
So... effed up.

59:19.677 --> 59:21.263
Five...

59:21.346 --> 59:23.015
four...

59:23.098 --> 59:24.767
three...

59:24.850 --> 59:26.518
two...

59:57.343 --> 59:58.594
Yeah?

59:58.719 --> 01:00:01.640
Steve, would you please open the door?

01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:18.783
Jane, is, uh, Ned in there?

01:00:21.994 --> 01:00:23.830
Stevesie?

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:27.418
Stevesie, what's happening?
Are those hijackers?!

01:00:27.543 --> 01:00:30.462
Well, we call them "pirates" out here, Ned.

01:00:30.546 --> 01:00:32.923
You were supposed to be on watch, by the way.

01:00:33.006 --> 01:00:37.010
Oh, my God, you're right. Stevesie, look...

01:00:39.054 --> 01:00:40.640
Whoa! No!

01:00:42.183 --> 01:00:44.561
So you were reading to each other in French?

01:00:44.644 --> 01:00:47.105
No, it's in English. It was translated.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:50.483
You're not supposed to go
into each other's cabins on a boat.

01:00:50.608 --> 01:00:54.530
- Why not?
- It's just kind of an unwritten maritime rule

01:00:54.655 --> 01:00:56.657
when you're at sea.

01:00:56.741 --> 01:00:59.201
Especially the goddamn lookout.

01:00:59.285 --> 01:01:01.912
- I'm so sorry.
- So am I.

01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:04.290
You hung us out to dry.

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:11.339
If we don't handle this right,
we're gonna all get murdered,

01:01:11.465 --> 01:01:14.551
including her unborn British child.

01:01:21.768 --> 01:01:23.853
I'm gonna kill you for that, asshole!

01:01:23.936 --> 01:01:28.149
I'm gonna hit you so fucking hard,
you'll be blind!

01:01:29.442 --> 01:01:31.736
Please don't hurt him!

01:01:35.199 --> 01:01:37.826
Watch me. I'll let you know
when I'm gonna move.

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:42.081
It's safer to do what they say. They
probably just want our money and jewels.

01:01:42.164 --> 01:01:47.754
Yeah, then how am I gonna finish
my movie, then? Jesus. Holy fuck.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:52.217
- They're going to kill us, Steve.
- I'm patting you on the back now, Klausy.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:57.263
Don't be scared. I'm gonna get us through
this, everybody. Ogata. Como esta. Pel?

01:02:00.935 --> 01:02:04.438
Wake up, Ned-o! I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:02:05.106 --> 01:02:09.110
I need to speak with the man in charge.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:15.158
Don't point that gun at him. He's an unpaid
intern. Vikram, what coverage you get?

01:02:15.242 --> 01:02:19.704
I kept rolling till they put this hood on me.

01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:23.625
Bill speaks their language.
What are they saying?

01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:25.669
Hold on.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:35.054
OK. Apparently they're taking a hostage.
Obviously they've chosen Ned.

01:02:38.724 --> 01:02:43.939
Now that they've found out I speak Filipino,
they seem to be changing their minds.

01:02:48.735 --> 01:02:52.030
- Do you have a vault? They wanna know.
- There's no vault.

01:02:52.114 --> 01:02:56.536
Our vault contains at least ten different
currencies from all over the world,

01:02:56.619 --> 01:03:01.207
and we are prepared for every kind
of financial necessity.

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:05.003
There goes Ned's inheritance.

01:03:05.086 --> 01:03:10.468
Tell them if they don't get off my boat right
now, there's gonna be a major shit storm.

01:03:22.689 --> 01:03:26.610
Ned-o, can you hear me?!
We'll get you back, Billy.

01:03:26.693 --> 01:03:29.362
Is everybody else safe?
Anne-Marie, are you OK?

01:03:29.446 --> 01:03:33.284
No, I'm not. I told you
these were unprotected waters.

01:03:33.367 --> 01:03:35.661
What a fuckin' nightmare.

01:03:38.664 --> 01:03:43.711
Be cool on this shit, OK, cubbie?
I mean, at least try to show both sides.

01:03:43.836 --> 01:03:46.548
I need to find a baby for this father.

01:03:47.091 --> 01:03:49.468
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

01:04:06.402 --> 01:04:07.570
Here we go.

01:04:07.654 --> 01:04:12.367
- Steve... what are you...
- I said get your ass the hell off of my boat!

01:05:18.229 --> 01:05:22.276
I've never seen a bond-company stooge
stick his neck out like that.

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.414
What's that sound? Is that...?

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:37.459
The arctic night lights, yeah.

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:42.589
"As if the natural world's been
turned upside down." Lord Mandrake.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.139
Vikram, get some cutaways of this miracle.

01:05:50.223 --> 01:05:53.893
Klaus, Ogata, put out
the deck fires before we sink.

01:05:56.145 --> 01:06:00.776
Those fucking amateurs.
You left your dog, you idiots.

01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:08.867
Wrap this stiff in a tablecloth.
We're gonna bury him at sea.

01:06:08.951 --> 01:06:13.081
Shouldn't we give him
to the authorities or something?

01:06:13.164 --> 01:06:15.291
No.

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:17.919
I'll write up a few words to read over him.

01:06:18.962 --> 01:06:21.840
How you holding up there, intern?
Doing OK?

01:06:25.427 --> 01:06:28.764
Ned, how many fingers am I holding up?

01:06:28.889 --> 01:06:31.600
I don't know. That's not my job.

01:06:32.476 --> 01:06:37.440
- Too many to tell. How many fingers...
- He's gonna be just fine.

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:50.620
I believe it's criminal that Steve allowed this
to happen to us, by which I mean illegal.

01:06:50.704 --> 01:06:56.335
We're being led on an illegal suicide
mission by a selfish maniac.

01:06:56.419 --> 01:07:00.465
I hear what you're saying,
but I think you misjudge the guy.

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:08.223
Saint Paul said to the Corinthians:

01:07:08.307 --> 01:07:13.645
"Without kin, no man may regard
himself kindly. Without s..."

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.939
Holy shit! Son of a bitch. Cut.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:24.532
This is Captain Hennessey. We've come
in response to your distress signal...

01:07:26.785 --> 01:07:29.329
Good God, is that you, Steven?

01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:33.959
Run downstairs, put a tarp over anything
that says "Hennessey" on it.

01:07:34.043 --> 01:07:38.047
- What about this guy?
- Just throw him over the other side.

01:07:43.594 --> 01:07:45.889
Your engine blew up and your fuel's been stolen.

01:07:45.972 --> 01:07:47.516
Correct?

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:52.813
I know how you feel. Some crooked fuckers
just stripped my Sealab, you know.

01:07:52.896 --> 01:07:56.316
Probably the same dudes.

01:07:56.399 --> 01:08:02.490
I can tow you as far as Port-au-Patois.
I'll need your signature on that invoice first.

01:08:02.573 --> 01:08:06.577
It accounts for the expenses of the rescue,
my time and that of my crew.

01:08:06.661 --> 01:08:09.038
This is more than the budget of my project.

01:08:09.122 --> 01:08:11.582
It's an estimate. What's your dog's name?

01:08:15.629 --> 01:08:17.923
Cody.

01:08:21.926 --> 01:08:23.886
Be still, Cody.

01:08:29.018 --> 01:08:31.395
I have to run this by
my bond-company stooge.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:35.567
- He's been kidnapped.
- That's true. I have to rescue him first.

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:38.361
Sign it now, or I'm leaving you out here.

01:08:43.826 --> 01:08:47.078
Oh, I dined with Eleanor last weekend.

01:08:47.162 --> 01:08:51.667
By the way, she's summering at my villa
in West Port-au-Patois, don't you know?

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.921
Say, how's Team Zissou holding up without her?

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:08.394
The first thing that goes through a
captain's head when there's low morale is:

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:11.898
"What'd I do? Is it all my fault?"

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:16.234
Well, he's probably right.
Most of us have been together a long time.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:19.406
There are others that were here before that.

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:23.076
Do you all... not like me any more?

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.288
I mean, what am I
supposed to do? I don't know.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.082
Look...

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:33.630
if you're not against me, don't cross this line.

01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:36.256
If yes, do.

01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:38.468
I love you all.

01:09:43.348 --> 01:09:45.810
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:47.895
I don't understand. Why?

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.314
What do you mean?

01:09:50.397 --> 01:09:53.901
Wait a second. What are we doing?
You said cross the line if...

01:09:53.984 --> 01:09:57.571
- Cross the line if you're going to quit.
- Oh...

01:09:57.696 --> 01:10:00.534
Do it again. I misunderstood.

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:11.002
Hi, Ross.
I got your corrections on the proofs.

01:10:11.086 --> 01:10:15.299
They're fine, but... I'm not coming back.

01:10:15.383 --> 01:10:17.927
It's over.
Please don't try to contact me, OK?

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:20.304
You'll hear from us... sometime.

01:10:24.642 --> 01:10:27.271
We got attacked by pirates.

01:10:27.354 --> 01:10:29.731
I feel as if life has...

01:10:32.985 --> 01:10:37.364
Well, you get the idea.
Anyway, take care of yourself. Jane.

01:10:37.948 --> 01:10:40.034
Will you write to me?

01:10:40.118 --> 01:10:43.621
Of course. Give me the address.

01:10:43.746 --> 01:10:48.376
Actually, I went ahead and stamped and
self-addressed 50 or so envelopes

01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:52.423
just to make it easier for you.

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:55.092
Thanks. I'll use them.

01:10:55.176 --> 01:10:58.179
Each one has three blank pages in it, and...

01:11:00.014 --> 01:11:02.808
there's a pen.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:06.813
Maybe I'm going to write you a letter right now.

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.775
OK.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:22.205
I bet I'm gonna really miss you, Ned.

01:11:24.457 --> 01:11:26.667
I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:11:26.793 --> 01:11:29.921
In fact, I feel like... I don't know,

01:11:30.004 --> 01:11:33.759
I feel like my heart's almost getting broken.

01:11:33.884 --> 01:11:36.345
I guess I'm overreacting.

01:11:39.765 --> 01:11:42.059
Is that really true?

01:11:44.102 --> 01:11:46.105
Yes, it is.

01:11:47.565 --> 01:11:51.486
That was all off the record, cubbie,
that whole deal.

01:11:51.611 --> 01:11:54.864
Actually, I'm surprised you didn't
cross the line yourself.

01:11:54.989 --> 01:11:57.742
- What line?
- The line I drew on the deck just now.

01:11:57.826 --> 01:12:00.913
- You weren't up there?
- No.

01:12:00.996 --> 01:12:02.957
You're kidding.

01:12:03.082 --> 01:12:06.836
That was one of the most dramatic things
that's ever happened on this boat.

01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:11.424
I just lost all my best interns. I thought
you were supposed to be covering this.

01:12:11.508 --> 01:12:14.678
- You just said it was off the record.
- But you didn't know that.

01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:18.598
- I was down here packing.
- You're at the wrong breaker.

01:12:19.975 --> 01:12:22.936
So you are leaving.

01:12:23.645 --> 01:12:26.107
You're jumping ship on me.

01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:28.568
I'm going to scrap the article.

01:12:28.693 --> 01:12:32.363
You mean you're not even gonna
write the cover story on me?

01:12:32.488 --> 01:12:34.782
Man, I don't have any stature any more.

01:12:34.866 --> 01:12:38.912
Sorry, Steve. Everything just got
too weird, that's all.

01:12:38.996 --> 01:12:42.749
But I gave you a goddamn
show-stopper up there.

01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:47.296
Are you sleeping with Ned?

01:12:47.421 --> 01:12:51.259
- That's none of your business.
- OK. Are you?

01:12:51.384 --> 01:12:53.386
No, I'm not.

01:12:56.264 --> 01:13:00.518
You're gonna miss the jaguar shark
or whatever it is if it actually exists.

01:13:01.853 --> 01:13:03.855
Are you crying?

01:13:06.108 --> 01:13:08.861
You cry easily, don't you?

01:13:08.944 --> 01:13:12.781
Bloody hell, God save that poor little stooge.

01:13:12.865 --> 01:13:15.409
This never would've happened
if Eleanor was with us.

01:13:15.493 --> 01:13:19.331
- Thanks, man.
- Your luck had better change soon, mate.

01:13:19.456 --> 01:13:22.250
Now I must away. I'll send you a postcard.

01:13:22.334 --> 01:13:25.837
- What? Where are you going?
- Abroad for a spell, my darling.

01:13:25.962 --> 01:13:30.926
It's my passport status, you see. I'm X-9
at the moment. Legally, I'm a fugitive.

01:13:31.009 --> 01:13:35.223
Wait a second.
They stole my budget, my boat's broken,

01:13:35.306 --> 01:13:39.435
you're ditchin' me up the creek.
What am I supposed to do here?

01:13:39.519 --> 01:13:41.896
Well, I must say, nothing's jumping to mind.

01:13:42.021 --> 01:13:45.400
Phillip, any suggestions?
No, he's shaking his head.

01:13:46.902 --> 01:13:50.739
Land ho!
Port-au-Patois, dead ahead.

01:13:51.281 --> 01:13:55.661
Port-au-Patois. Port-au-Patois ho!

01:13:55.744 --> 01:13:57.747
Ho!

01:13:58.122 --> 01:14:00.166
Ho!

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.627
Land ho!

01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:04.337
Ho!

01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:11.345
No, I can't give you full credit,
but I'm not gonna flunk you, either.

01:14:11.428 --> 01:14:13.973
You're all getting "incompletes".

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:18.686
This is bullshit.

01:14:52.473 --> 01:14:55.517
Oh, shit. What do you want?

01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:57.978
Do you mind if I butter you up before I answer?

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:00.981
Yes, I do. Tell me now.

01:15:02.191 --> 01:15:04.652
I need some money to get the boat out of hock

01:15:04.777 --> 01:15:07.530
and rescue my bond-company stooge
who got kidnapped.

01:15:07.614 --> 01:15:10.742
Could we ask your parents to loan it to me?

01:15:10.825 --> 01:15:12.577
No.

01:15:13.786 --> 01:15:15.663
OK.

01:15:16.664 --> 01:15:20.794
Could I butter you up anyway?
It took me two and a half hours to get here.

01:15:24.256 --> 01:15:27.760
- Who's that dude?
- It's my research assistant, Javier.

01:15:27.843 --> 01:15:30.596
Javier, te presento Steve.

01:15:31.848 --> 01:15:33.850
Steve.

01:15:38.563 --> 01:15:45.238
- Necesito cinco minutos.
- I'd be jealous about you staying at Ali's

01:15:45.321 --> 01:15:47.865
except I always thought he was a closet queer.

01:15:49.617 --> 01:15:52.954
So how's your father-son relationship
coming along?

01:15:53.037 --> 01:15:57.334
Well, nobody has a real lock on any of this,
so I don't know how it all times out.

01:15:57.417 --> 01:16:00.921
I mean, I know I want him
to think of me like a father.

01:16:01.004 --> 01:16:03.215
But the fact that there's a chance

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:08.137
that he could really be
my actual... biological son...

01:16:11.182 --> 01:16:13.560
..is very difficult for me.

01:16:19.983 --> 01:16:24.780
You know I'm not big on apologizing,
so I'll just skip it, if it's all the same to you.

01:16:24.905 --> 01:16:25.906
OK.

01:16:26.031 --> 01:16:28.325
But anyway, I'm sorry.

01:16:29.994 --> 01:16:33.747
I know I haven't been at my best
this past decade.

01:16:33.873 --> 01:16:35.583
That's true.

01:16:37.752 --> 01:16:40.630
What happened to me?

01:16:40.714 --> 01:16:43.675
Did I lose my talent?

01:16:43.758 --> 01:16:46.386
Am I ever gonna be good again?

01:16:47.512 --> 01:16:49.514
I don't know.

01:16:51.559 --> 01:16:55.938
Doesn't matter, anyway. It's probably
the last adventure I've got in me.

01:16:56.022 --> 01:17:02.069
I was hoping to go out in a flash of blazes,
but I'll probably just end up going home.

01:17:02.153 --> 01:17:05.449
Unless you're planning to sell the island.

01:17:05.532 --> 01:17:08.494
I wonder how much I could get for it.

01:17:08.577 --> 01:17:10.537
In this market?

01:17:12.789 --> 01:17:17.170
You were probably right all along.
We should've had a kid together.

01:17:17.253 --> 01:17:21.299
Of course, you were kinda already...

01:17:21.382 --> 01:17:23.760
on the edge of being too old.

01:17:24.802 --> 01:17:27.096
Unless maybe that's a cop-out.

01:17:31.644 --> 01:17:34.355
It's worse than a cop-out. I was 34.

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.821
It's good to see you, Eleanor.

01:17:45.909 --> 01:17:47.911
I'm about to blow my stack.

01:17:47.994 --> 01:17:50.705
I turn my back, and the bullshit begins.

01:17:50.789 --> 01:17:52.833
Ned, you're a scumbag.

01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:56.336
And, Jane, you're a goddamn liar.

01:17:56.419 --> 01:17:58.464
What the fuck are you doing in here?

01:17:58.548 --> 01:18:00.925
What the F are you doing in here?

01:18:01.008 --> 01:18:05.179
I warned you about being in other people's
cabins. You were supposed to go home.

01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:09.559
You convinced me to stay and finish the story.

01:18:09.642 --> 01:18:13.730
- Is it still the cover?
- I don't fucking know.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:18.819
Don't you dare put on that uniform.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.321
It's all I have with me.

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:25.535
I told you I have a bit of a thing for her.
"Not this one, " I said.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:28.663
You said, "Not this one, Klaus."

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:32.041
- So you heard me?
- You're too old for me, Steve.

01:18:32.834 --> 01:18:37.214
- Well, you're pregnant.
- Can I have a word with you privately?

01:18:37.298 --> 01:18:39.091
Yes.

01:18:43.345 --> 01:18:45.347
Follow me.

01:18:48.934 --> 01:18:52.522
- Are you two fighting?
- I'll deal with you later.

01:18:53.523 --> 01:18:56.067
Look, Steve, I know we both like her

01:18:56.193 --> 01:19:00.113
and you're angry and embarrassed,
but leave her out of it.

01:19:00.197 --> 01:19:04.994
You think that's what this is about? Shit,
what has that bull dyke been telling you?

01:19:05.119 --> 01:19:09.123
All right, I'm gonna warn you now,
be a gentleman.

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:12.043
What are you doing here?
I thought you interns ran out.

01:19:12.126 --> 01:19:15.880
- I wanna help you find that shark.
- Goddammit. Thank you, intern.

01:19:16.005 --> 01:19:18.300
- You're gettin' an A.
- His name's Nico.

01:19:18.383 --> 01:19:20.511
- Who?
- Hello, Vikram.

01:19:20.594 --> 01:19:25.307
Gimme that camera.
I'm gonna smash it over your head.

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:27.935
Cut!

01:19:28.018 --> 01:19:32.065
I misread you, man.
I'm gonna have to rethink some shit.

01:19:32.148 --> 01:19:34.776
You don't know me.
You never wanted to know me.

01:19:34.859 --> 01:19:38.112
I'm just a character in your film.

01:19:38.238 --> 01:19:41.658
It's a documentary.
It's all really happening.

01:19:41.783 --> 01:19:44.078
Well, damn you for that.

01:19:46.205 --> 01:19:48.582
Go to bed, you sons of bitches.

01:19:52.711 --> 01:19:55.756
That pregnant slut's been playing us
like a cheap fiddle.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.134
That's it. I'm gonna fight you, Steve.

01:20:00.804 --> 01:20:03.014
You never say, "I'm gonna fight you."

01:20:03.139 --> 01:20:06.560
You just smile and act natural,
and then you sucker-punch him.

01:20:06.643 --> 01:20:13.067
- You fight your way, and I'll fight mine.
- Oh, listen, Ned. Don't you try...

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.532
I think your Team Zissou ring
might've caught me on the lip.

01:20:23.326 --> 01:20:27.246
You call yourself my son, but...

01:20:27.371 --> 01:20:29.748
I just don't see it.

01:20:29.832 --> 01:20:32.792
It's nothing personal.

01:20:32.876 --> 01:20:35.170
What do you want?

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.964
Nothing.

01:20:39.047 --> 01:20:43.677
That's so arrogant.
That's... Screw off.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.096
I can't believe I asked
if I could call you "Dad".

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:50.307
- Of course you said no.
- I let you call me Stevesie.

01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:52.684
It sounds better.

01:20:54.853 --> 01:20:57.313
It doesn't mean the same thing.

01:21:01.567 --> 01:21:04.194
A week before she killed herself,
my mother told me

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:08.281
that you'd known about me
since the day I was born.

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.574
Is that a fact?

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:14.286
That's a fact.

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:18.289
I ought to have stayed
in Kentucky where I belong.

01:21:23.877 --> 01:21:26.630
Quiet.

01:21:26.713 --> 01:21:29.548
Somebody pay for this water taxi.

01:21:32.801 --> 01:21:34.803
You got any petty cash on you?

01:21:37.347 --> 01:21:40.057
Remind me to send
Eleanor's parents a thank-you note

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:43.393
- on the good correspondence stock.
- OK.

01:21:44.853 --> 01:21:47.146
This is the message we received earlier

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:51.067
on our answering machine at Pescespada Island.

01:21:53.151 --> 01:21:55.111
Bill Ubell here. I'm on a payphone.

01:21:55.195 --> 01:21:57.239
I am blindfolded and my arms are bound,

01:21:57.364 --> 01:21:59.573
but a boy has been kind enough to assist me,

01:21:59.698 --> 01:22:02.618
and there's not much chance
I'll get another call,

01:22:02.701 --> 01:22:06.538
so I thought I would
ask if... What? No.

01:22:11.166 --> 01:22:13.293
Well, thanks for checking in, Bill.

01:22:13.418 --> 01:22:17.171
Next time, maybe you could
let us know where you're at.

01:22:17.296 --> 01:22:22.176
Based on the quality of the connection,
the variety of wildlife in the background,

01:22:22.301 --> 01:22:26.847
and the elapsed time between
Mr Ubell's capture and this message,

01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:30.516
there's a good chance
he's on one of the Ping Islands.

01:22:30.599 --> 01:22:34.103
There used to be
a four-star hotel on Little Ping.

01:22:34.186 --> 01:22:37.772
But the entire island was destroyed
by a monsoon five years ago.

01:22:37.897 --> 01:22:40.024
It's been uninhabited ever since.

01:22:40.108 --> 01:22:42.776
I know the place. Hotel Citroen.

01:22:43.777 --> 01:22:47.780
Cubbie, I'd like to speak
on the record for a moment.

01:22:47.864 --> 01:22:51.617
Eleanor has always been
the brains behind Team Zissou.

01:22:51.742 --> 01:22:54.119
By the way, are you gonna
put in a good description

01:22:54.244 --> 01:22:56.955
of the command centre I've set up down here?

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:03.919
OK, gang, that's the plan. Set a course
for Ping Island, full speed ahead.

01:23:04.003 --> 01:23:08.548
You'll need to hire a team of mechanics
to rebuild the engine first, of course.

01:23:08.631 --> 01:23:11.301
I know.
I'm saying, after that.

01:23:11.925 --> 01:23:14.219
Just because I've decided to save your neck

01:23:14.344 --> 01:23:17.556
and help you do this rescue
doesn't mean you've won me back.

01:23:17.639 --> 01:23:19.765
Yes, ma'am.

01:23:28.607 --> 01:23:30.649
Thanks.

01:23:31.692 --> 01:23:35.446
Is the father out of the picture?

01:23:35.529 --> 01:23:39.866
Actually, I was sort of terrified
about having this baby.

01:23:39.949 --> 01:23:43.786
Right now, I'm not really scared of anything.

01:23:43.869 --> 01:23:47.873
- Maybe it's my hormones.
- That makes sense.

01:23:49.665 --> 01:23:54.170
I'm gonna tell you something confidentially
which won't be mentioned again.

01:23:54.253 --> 01:23:58.173
I'm pretty sure I'm the only person
who can say this, including Steve...

01:23:58.256 --> 01:24:00.926
Never mind how I found out.
I'm a scientist.

01:24:01.009 --> 01:24:04.136
It's the thing that puzzles me
about Ned's situation.

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.014
- What is it?
- Zissou shoots blanks.

01:24:10.809 --> 01:24:15.229
I think maybe it's because
he spent half his life underwater.

01:24:47.756 --> 01:24:50.758
Let's try track three against picture.

01:24:56.763 --> 01:25:01.643
A reef surrounds the Ping Islands,
warning intruders to keep their distance.

01:25:03.936 --> 01:25:07.189
Today, we discover
one of its victims off the coast of Ping 3.

01:25:09.524 --> 01:25:14.654
Our colleague, Alistair Hennessey,
and his crew are nowhere to be found.

01:25:14.779 --> 01:25:16.864
We will land at dawn.

01:25:18.449 --> 01:25:20.159
Not bad.

01:25:20.242 --> 01:25:22.452
We'll temp it with that, anyway.

01:25:57.774 --> 01:26:00.066
All right, let's go.

01:26:22.169 --> 01:26:24.003
Oh, shit. Swamp leeches.

01:26:24.087 --> 01:26:27.090
Everybody check for swamp leeches
and pull 'em off.

01:26:31.551 --> 01:26:33.845
Nobody else got hit? What's the deal?

01:26:37.014 --> 01:26:40.226
What a shame.
They had a bartender here, Keno,

01:26:40.309 --> 01:26:44.062
made the best rum Cannonball I've ever tasted.

01:26:44.187 --> 01:26:46.564
You ready, Vikram?

01:26:47.856 --> 01:26:51.276
- About six and a half.
- All right, shall we do this?

01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:18.258
Barometer's falling.
It's gonna rain. We gotta be quick.

01:27:18.341 --> 01:27:20.634
- Where are they?
- Unknown. Split into groups.

01:27:20.717 --> 01:27:23.178
I'll take Ned, Ogata, and Wolodarsky.

01:27:23.303 --> 01:27:27.140
Thanks.
Thanks a lot for not picking me.

01:27:27.223 --> 01:27:30.976
What? We're smack in the middle
of a lightning-strike rescue op, Klaus.

01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:33.645
- What's the deal?
- I'm sick of being on B squad.

01:27:33.728 --> 01:27:38.357
Listen, you may be on B squad,
but you're the B squad leader.

01:27:39.358 --> 01:27:43.653
Don't you know me and Esteban
always thought of you as our baby brother?

01:27:43.736 --> 01:27:46.698
I've always thought of you two as my dads.

01:27:47.699 --> 01:27:51.118
Please don't let anyone
make fun of me for saying so.

01:27:51.243 --> 01:27:55.788
I can't guarantee that, Klausy, but I'll try.
Can we get on with the manoeuvres now?

01:27:56.581 --> 01:27:58.708
Wolodarsky, you got something?

01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:00.835
Not yet.

01:28:06.423 --> 01:28:08.466
Anybody see anybody?

01:28:08.591 --> 01:28:10.468
Empty.

01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:16.639
- Klaus, pirates?
- No.

01:28:16.723 --> 01:28:19.184
I think this whole place is deserted.

01:28:19.309 --> 01:28:21.935
Shit. We played a bum hunch.

01:28:22.019 --> 01:28:27.148
Fuck. OK, let's not get down on ourselves.
We got two more Ping Islands to check out,

01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:29.776
except I don't know
if we have enough gas to do it.

01:28:29.859 --> 01:28:33.612
Dammit, Steve!

01:28:33.695 --> 01:28:36.239
This sucks.

01:28:36.323 --> 01:28:38.991
I'm disappointed in myself.

01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:49.667
My first wife, Jacqueline,
and I spent our honeymoon here.

01:28:51.043 --> 01:28:53.420
Things are pretty different now.

01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.716
All right, let's check out.

01:29:04.596 --> 01:29:06.681
Did you get that, Vikram?

01:29:06.765 --> 01:29:07.933
Uh, yeah.

01:29:08.016 --> 01:29:11.685
Good. We'll give them
the reality this time.

01:29:11.769 --> 01:29:15.605
A washed-up old man with no friends,
no distribution deal,

01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:18.400
wife on the rocks, people laughing at him,

01:29:18.483 --> 01:29:20.693
feeling sorry for himself.

01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:24.738
Can I have a word alone with my son, please?

01:29:26.490 --> 01:29:29.575
- Are you all right?
- Not really.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:38.291
By the way, I've been trying to think of a
nickname that might mean the right thing.

01:29:38.417 --> 01:29:40.459
I came up with "Papa Steve".

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:55.889
I'm sorry I never acknowledged
your existence all those years.

01:29:56.014 --> 01:29:58.475
It won't happen again.
I mean it.

01:30:01.185 --> 01:30:03.646
You are my son to me.

01:30:03.771 --> 01:30:06.231
Almost more so.

01:30:07.274 --> 01:30:11.777
See, for me to meet a guy
like you at this time in my life...

01:30:12.987 --> 01:30:15.656
I don't know. Uh... it's just...

01:30:16.657 --> 01:30:19.909
I wanna communicate my feelings to you,

01:30:20.034 --> 01:30:24.037
but... I think I might start to cry.

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:30.293
That's OK.

01:30:31.335 --> 01:30:33.546
There's something in the coat check.

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:42.845
Hey, Billy. You OK?

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:47.016
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah. It was kinda garbled.

01:30:54.605 --> 01:30:56.273
Jesus.

01:30:56.356 --> 01:30:58.650
These pirates are monsters.

01:30:58.776 --> 01:31:03.112
But remember, I shot one of their guys
in the neck last week and killed him, so...

01:31:03.196 --> 01:31:05.490
I think we're OK, too.

01:31:06.782 --> 01:31:07.866
Where's Cody?

01:31:12.287 --> 01:31:14.288
Cody?

01:31:29.093 --> 01:31:31.052
See you...

01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:35.431
Steven, are you rescuing me?

01:31:40.644 --> 01:31:42.604
Fold.

01:31:57.616 --> 01:31:59.910
Klaus, bring the dynamite.

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:18.968
They were in there after all!
Run! Go! Move now!

01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:33.730
Vikram got some great footage
of your boat. I guess it's totalled?

01:32:33.855 --> 01:32:37.775
Perhaps. We're extremely well insured.
I'll probably come out ahead.

01:32:37.859 --> 01:32:42.571
Although we'll obviously have
to crew up from scratch next time.

01:32:42.654 --> 01:32:45.448
They made soup of my research turtles.

01:32:55.206 --> 01:32:57.583
Ogata, give some first aid to Pele.

01:32:57.708 --> 01:33:00.252
Klausy, Ned-o.

01:33:00.335 --> 01:33:03.921
Dig in and hold these rustlers off
while I call in the rendezvous.

01:33:04.005 --> 01:33:05.506
We'll meet on the beach.

01:33:07.008 --> 01:33:09.218
You're A squad.

01:33:10.385 --> 01:33:13.555
Renzo, Renzo, Renzo.
Anybody, hello? Hello?

01:33:13.638 --> 01:33:15.931
This gizmo's out of juice.

01:33:18.976 --> 01:33:20.436
Thanks.

01:33:25.023 --> 01:33:26.399
No, Captain.

01:33:26.483 --> 01:33:29.276
That's Cedric. He's a friend.

01:33:30.527 --> 01:33:32.404
Merci. Cedric.

01:33:32.529 --> 01:33:35.156
Remind me, we'll send him
a red cap and a Speedo.

01:33:37.909 --> 01:33:41.912
Wolodarsky, go get the keys to that
fishing boat and throw them in the water.

01:33:41.995 --> 01:33:45.749
No, wait. They might have
another set. Just blow it up.

01:33:47.958 --> 01:33:49.377
Hey, Ned.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:52.671
It looks like we recovered your inheritance.

01:33:53.713 --> 01:33:54.881
Klausy.

01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:08.810
That's it. I'm retired.

01:34:23.197 --> 01:34:25.824
Oh, no, we forgot Cody.
We gotta go back.

01:34:32.788 --> 01:34:35.457
Goodbye, Cody.

01:34:53.472 --> 01:34:57.475
See, this represents the Belafonte.
And here's Pescespada Island,

01:34:57.559 --> 01:35:00.020
and that circle represents friendship,

01:35:00.145 --> 01:35:02.771
and the K here stands for Klaus.

01:35:02.855 --> 01:35:05.315
Where's your symbol, Ned?

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:07.400
I didn't wanna impose myself.

01:35:07.483 --> 01:35:11.070
Klaus is right.
The flag needs a Ned symbol.

01:35:11.195 --> 01:35:15.741
I suppose we could put an N
on the side of that octopus.

01:35:15.824 --> 01:35:18.368
What's that stand for over there?

01:35:18.493 --> 01:35:20.202
That's Esteban.

01:35:20.745 --> 01:35:23.039
It was working OK until late last night,

01:35:23.164 --> 01:35:26.499
but now the tracking system's
gone completely on the fritz.

01:35:27.083 --> 01:35:32.588
Screw it. Sell it for scrap along with the
boat and the submarines. I'm going home.

01:35:33.130 --> 01:35:36.258
Let's take up the whirlybird
and see what we find, anyway.

01:35:36.342 --> 01:35:39.761
I got a feeling we can spot this fish from 111 feet up.

01:35:39.844 --> 01:35:43.597
Ned, I don't know
if I ever even saw the bastard.

01:35:44.723 --> 01:35:48.643
I have $ 275,000 invested in this damn production.

01:35:48.727 --> 01:35:52.313
Something ate Esteban,
didn't it? Now lead!

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:55.524
Right?

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:57.859
Right? Ho!

01:36:01.863 --> 01:36:02.363
Ho.

01:36:21.879 --> 01:36:23.464
What's that?

01:36:23.547 --> 01:36:25.591
Letter from Jane.

01:36:25.675 --> 01:36:28.551
What does she say?

01:36:28.635 --> 01:36:31.096
Nothing to speak of.

01:36:39.936 --> 01:36:42.397
Thank you for putting me on the flag, Ned.

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.941
Of course, Klaus. It was my pleasure.

01:36:45.024 --> 01:36:46.984
But you stitched me onto the dolphin,

01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:49.736
and I want you to know
how much that means to me.

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.779
Well, I'm very pleased you liked it.

01:36:51.862 --> 01:36:55.199
You're not listening!
I didn't just like it...

01:37:01.621 --> 01:37:06.333
- You understand?
- Yes, I do. Thank you, Klaus.

01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:20.220
I've still got yours, of course.

01:37:20.345 --> 01:37:21.680
My what?

01:37:27.059 --> 01:37:31.479
"Dear Captain Zissou, I am 12 years old
and live in Jawbone, Kentucky."

01:37:31.563 --> 01:37:34.441
"A creek runs behind our house,
where I live with my mother."

01:37:34.523 --> 01:37:36.275
"She met you once some years ago,

01:37:36.358 --> 01:37:40.279
and I collect and catalogue
amphibians, reptiles and insects."

01:37:40.404 --> 01:37:43.364
"I don't know what
this one's called, so I named it."

01:37:43.448 --> 01:37:47.367
"You are probably my one of, if not
the favourite person I've ever studied."

01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:50.370
"I plan to be either
A: an oceanographer,

01:37:50.454 --> 01:37:52.748
B: an architect,
C: a pilot."

01:37:52.831 --> 01:37:56.208
"Thank you for your good work.
Sincerely, Ned Plimpton,

01:37:56.292 --> 01:37:58.586
Blue Star Cadet, Zissou Society."

01:37:58.669 --> 01:38:01.338
"PS: Do you ever wish
you could breathe underwater?"

01:38:05.549 --> 01:38:08.510
I still wish I could breathe underwater.

01:38:08.594 --> 01:38:10.387
Me, too, Ned.

01:38:16.809 --> 01:38:20.312
- Fluorescent snapper.
- What? Really? What's that?

01:38:20.437 --> 01:38:23.814
A good sign. The last time
we saw that big shitkicker here...

01:38:29.986 --> 01:38:32.280
Something popped up there, didn't it?

01:38:32.405 --> 01:38:35.075
I heard a pin snap loose
on the rotator mechanism.

01:38:40.746 --> 01:38:43.206
This is gonna hurt.

01:39:00.262 --> 01:39:01.262
Ned!

01:39:02.263 --> 01:39:04.057
Ned!

01:39:08.644 --> 01:39:11.522
- Ned.
- Hey, Stevesie.

01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:21.947
Are you OK?

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:25.367
I think I'm OK.

01:39:27.493 --> 01:39:30.454
What happened?
Did we hit something?

01:39:31.455 --> 01:39:33.832
Most likely not.

01:39:34.833 --> 01:39:37.544
I think maybe the pushrod failed.

01:39:38.961 --> 01:39:43.090
I'm sorry, Ned. I should've
scrapped this chopper ten years ago.

01:39:43.173 --> 01:39:48.386
Maybe I should've autorotated and
performed a high bank during our descent.

01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:51.471
We might've crashed a little softer.

01:39:52.931 --> 01:39:56.851
Probably wouldn't have made
any difference, though.

01:41:04.991 --> 01:41:06.785
All hands, bury the dead.

01:42:12.756 --> 01:42:16.969
This is the first time
Eleanor's ever cried in front of me.

01:42:17.052 --> 01:42:20.138
Except for once when she got her arm
caught in the deck winch.

01:42:21.764 --> 01:42:25.183
Is this my espresso machine?

01:42:26.184 --> 01:42:29.187
How did you get my espresso machine?

01:42:29.271 --> 01:42:31.355
Well, uh...

01:42:31.439 --> 01:42:33.733
We fucking stole it, man.

01:42:36.985 --> 01:42:42.490
Ali, why don't you go powder your nose?
I need to talk to your ex-wife.

01:42:47.286 --> 01:42:50.955
We've never made great husbands, have we?

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.667
Of course, I have a good excuse.
I'm part gay.

01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:58.003
Supposedly, everyone is.

01:43:10.555 --> 01:43:13.432
I never told you this, but I was hoping...

01:43:13.515 --> 01:43:17.978
we might get the chance to adopt Ned.
I think he would've wanted it that way.

01:43:18.062 --> 01:43:21.397
- Would you have gone along with me?
- He was 30, Steve.

01:43:21.522 --> 01:43:24.150
But I'd have considered it.

01:43:24.233 --> 01:43:25.568
Thanks, Eleanor.

01:43:26.068 --> 01:43:28.153
We're a dying breed.

01:43:28.236 --> 01:43:30.864
Yeah.

01:43:30.948 --> 01:43:33.574
I guess we were all right
while we lasted, though.

01:43:33.658 --> 01:43:36.577
Oh, we were like glory's gate, my darling.

01:43:36.661 --> 01:43:40.747
We were like that bloody shark of yours.
We swam with the, um, uh...

01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:45.042
Oh, goddammit. I had it on the plane.
What was I gonna say?

01:43:45.125 --> 01:43:48.712
- Ah, well, it's good to see you.
- How's your passport status?

01:43:48.796 --> 01:43:52.173
Much better, thank you.
I'm back down to X-4.

01:43:52.257 --> 01:43:55.510
Tell me, who knocked up the reporter?

01:43:57.302 --> 01:43:58.553
I don't know.

01:44:05.643 --> 01:44:07.687
Thanks for showing me the first draft.

01:44:07.812 --> 01:44:11.022
You read it. What did you think?

01:44:11.106 --> 01:44:13.483
Well, I was a little embarrassed at first.

01:44:13.566 --> 01:44:18.279
Obviously people are gonna think
I'm a showboat and a little bit of a prick,

01:44:18.404 --> 01:44:21.239
but then I realised...

01:44:21.322 --> 01:44:23.116
That's me.

01:44:23.199 --> 01:44:26.160
I said those things, I did those things.

01:44:27.161 --> 01:44:29.454
I can live with that.

01:44:31.623 --> 01:44:33.833
You're a good writer, Jane.

01:44:33.958 --> 01:44:36.085
It's the effing cover.

01:44:37.086 --> 01:44:38.963
Attagirl.

01:44:40.005 --> 01:44:42.549
Excuse me.

01:44:42.632 --> 01:44:47.428
Sorry to interrupt, but we got the scanning
monitor up. Looks like the jaguar shark,

01:44:47.511 --> 01:44:52.390
or whatever it is that we're tracking,
is in a trench on the far side of the reef.

01:44:56.227 --> 01:45:00.063
What the hell is going on
in here with the wiring?

01:45:04.234 --> 01:45:06.527
Anybody feel like going for a ride?

01:45:16.536 --> 01:45:20.789
Ned's Theme, take one.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.755
I hooked a rhinestone bluefin
on a rope to give him something to eat.

01:46:14.292 --> 01:46:19.421
Is that one of mine? I think
one of my research turtles survived.

01:46:59.539 --> 01:47:01.832
Yeah, looks good.

01:48:10.848 --> 01:48:14.685
- Is that him?
- That's him, Klaus.

01:48:35.661 --> 01:48:37.871
Are we... Are we safe in here?

01:48:38.914 --> 01:48:40.915
I doubt it.

01:48:40.998 --> 01:48:43.751
You still want to blow him up?

01:48:44.752 --> 01:48:48.088
No. We're out of dynamite, anyway.

01:48:52.424 --> 01:48:55.177
It is beautiful, Steve.

01:48:56.011 --> 01:48:58.013
Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?

01:49:01.724 --> 01:49:04.018
I wonder if it remembers me.

01:49:30.164 --> 01:49:33.334
In 12 years, he'll be 11 and a half.

01:49:36.295 --> 01:49:38.589
That was my favourite age.

01:49:52.726 --> 01:49:56.478
- Like this?
- Just like that.

01:49:56.604 --> 01:49:58.898
You do it, too.

01:50:00.023 --> 01:50:05.612
We complete the adventure,
but another of our crew has been lost.

01:50:05.695 --> 01:50:07.571
This one was my son.

01:50:08.447 --> 01:50:10.824
Also our equity partner.

01:50:11.575 --> 01:50:15.328
We start the voyage home in our wounded vessel.

01:51:19.006 --> 01:51:20.507
Ho.

01:51:20.632 --> 01:51:21.883
Ho.

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.814
This is an adventure.
