WEBVTT

00:05.639 --> 00:07.108
Previously on E.R.:

00:07.141 --> 00:08.809
NEELA:
"Dear Michael.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.278
It's been months
since I've heard from you."

00:10.311 --> 00:12.480
MICHAEL:
"Tell everybody I'm still here.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.781
Still doing the doctor thing."

00:13.814 --> 00:15.116
( screaming in Arabic )

00:15.149 --> 00:16.617
MICHAEL:
She could die

00:16.650 --> 00:17.685
without the proper burn care.

00:17.718 --> 00:18.819
She can't get that here.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.488
Yeah, okay, I'll try.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.056
What's going on.
She's talking to Gallant.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.557
You got 72 hours, son.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.658
Get her there.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.194
MAN:
For Laura,

00:26.227 --> 00:28.129
my little one.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.336
Neela,
your favorite patient

00:35.369 --> 00:36.604
is out in Waiting,
asking for you.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.505
Oh, no, please.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.506
Back pain guy?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.640
Third day in a row.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.708
LOCKHART:
You can sign out to me

00:40.741 --> 00:42.110
but you have
to take care

00:42.143 --> 00:43.244
of your boyfriend
out there

00:43.277 --> 00:44.245
before you leave
the building.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.579
Deal.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.847
Hey, I heard the Iraqi girl's
coming in today.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.282
Have you talked
with Gallant?

00:48.316 --> 00:49.783
Not since we set it up,
but when she does,

00:49.817 --> 00:51.452
I'll call the CASH
to let him know.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.354
All right, but this time,
I want to talk to him.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.729
Who's that?

01:01.762 --> 01:04.331
Oh, that
is Tio Escobar, 17.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.300
Superficial stab wound
to the right flank.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.136
Not him, her.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.503
He cut me.
I didn't do nothin'.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.771
Word was,
you told Drake

01:10.804 --> 01:11.872
you were coming
for him with a gun.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.207
I didn't say that.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.142
There were witnesses.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.243
Mind if I take a look?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.677
Other doctor
already saw it.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.179
Yeah, well,
I'm the supervisor

01:18.212 --> 01:19.513
so I have
to check it out anyway.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.382
The wound is superficial.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.151
We'll be back
to clean it out.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.152
You got lucky.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.386
This time.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.488
Hi, I'm Dr. Pratt.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.423
Olivia Evans.
I'm with Ceasefire.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.858
Ceasefire?

01:30.891 --> 01:32.493
Violence prevention
program.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.595
How many

01:34.628 --> 01:36.530
shooting victims
do you see in a shift?

01:36.564 --> 01:37.731
Too many to count.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.300
Exactly.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.334
So how can you not know
about Ceasefire?

01:40.368 --> 01:42.170
Wait, the name sounds familiar.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.737
Tell me more about it.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.576
Tio and I-- we're not...
we're not done here.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.711
Are we, Tio?

01:50.744 --> 01:52.246
Anything else?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.283
I'll be back.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.919
So, what's she like?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.388
She's a health
professional, Ray.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.323
Don't be such a dog.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.194
( Taggart sighs )

02:06.227 --> 02:07.628
I shouldn't have
taken Franklin.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.532
Mom, what day is it?

02:11.565 --> 02:13.367
Wednesday.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.668
I meant date.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.871
It's right in
front of you, Alex.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.740
The 27th.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.908
Dad'll be coming soon.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.343
You spoke to him?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.877
No, he wrote me a letter.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.746
You never
said anything.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.348
He wrote it to me.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.318
And he said
he was coming to see you?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.519
Yeah.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.323
( sighs )

02:35.356 --> 02:37.758
Alex, honey,
how many times has he told you

02:37.791 --> 02:39.760
he was going to do something,
and then he didn't?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.831
Okay, Mr. Kirkendall,

02:43.864 --> 02:45.299
we'll do this
one more time.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.268
All right.
Thanks for your patience.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.470
Dr. Rasgotra,
you got a minute?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.839
You go right ahead,
I'll be with you in a moment.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.807
Okay, I'll-I'll wait right here.
Thank you very much.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.343
Uh, congratulations.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.777
On what?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.246
Yeah. The Iraqi mother
and daughter arrived

02:58.279 --> 02:59.780
early this morning.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.515
Oh, that's great!
Yeah. Is Dr.
Gallant around?

03:01.549 --> 03:02.683
I wanted to
introduce him

03:02.716 --> 03:03.684
to the plastics
attending.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.785
Excuse me?

03:04.818 --> 03:05.853
Dr. Gallant.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.421
Michael was in the hospital?

03:07.455 --> 03:08.856
Yeah. I was just
with him an hour ago.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.558
Oh.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.959
So, if you see him,
could you send him my way?

03:11.992 --> 03:13.527
The unit staff really
wants to meet him.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.928
He's, uh, he's a bit
of a hero up there.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.897
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:09.417 --> 04:11.652
Registration and urgent
care in the atrium,

04:11.685 --> 04:13.053
primary care
clinics over here.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.422
36 state-of-the-
art exam rooms

04:14.455 --> 04:16.857
with a dedicated
outpatient pharmacy.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.591
Mm-hmm.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.763
Lab and X ray suite located
behind the sculpture garden.

04:22.796 --> 04:23.764
And this?

04:23.797 --> 04:24.765
What's this?

04:24.798 --> 04:25.999
Commercial space.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.535
We're already taking bids.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.969
It'll probably go
to some fast-food joint.

04:29.002 --> 04:29.970
What?!

04:30.003 --> 04:31.339
Sorry I'm late.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.540
( panting )

04:32.573 --> 04:33.841
Kerry sends her apologies,

04:33.874 --> 04:35.976
but she, uh, had
an appropriations meeting.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.811
So... what do you think?

04:37.845 --> 04:38.812
Very impressive.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.548
Well, listen, uh,

04:40.581 --> 04:42.015
public affairs is working
on a press release

04:42.049 --> 04:43.717
about the Carter Foundation
contribution...

04:43.751 --> 04:45.586
Dr. Anspaugh, I
thought we agreed

04:45.619 --> 04:48.088
that comprehensive
HIV care would be
very much a part

04:48.121 --> 04:49.557
of all of this.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.091
We cannot get
into subspecialties yet.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.627
We had struggle enough
getting family med to commit.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.996
Primary care docs
can staff the
HIV clinic.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.032
There is no space for that.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.701
Well, maybe we
should pitch a tent

05:00.734 --> 05:02.102
in the sculpture
garden, or maybe

05:02.135 --> 05:04.372
we could stake out a few tables
in the burger joint.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.773
Look, the clinic was your idea.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.408
We are just trying
to make it happen.

05:07.441 --> 05:11.945
Primary care and
comprehensive
HIV treatment.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.548
Not Architectural Digest
and super-size meals.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.016
( chuckles )

05:16.049 --> 05:18.018
Call me when you have something
else for me to look at.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.054
12-year-old Victor Hopkins,
GSW to the groin, pulse 115,

05:21.088 --> 05:23.090
resps 20, 98/60.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.058
And my sats are okay.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.395
( laughs ):
Well, how do you
know about sats?

05:27.428 --> 05:28.562
I heard her say it
on the radio.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.830
OLBES:
Got two of morphine

05:29.863 --> 05:31.832
en route.
Mom's on her way in.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.901
Weird trajectory
for a GSW.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.102
Who shot you, Victor?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.804
Nobody. It just went off.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.938
You shot yourself?

05:37.971 --> 05:39.773
No, it was in my pocket.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.775
What's a smart kid
like you doing with a gun?

05:41.809 --> 05:43.911
Protecting myself.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.113
Michael, I don't know

05:46.146 --> 05:48.081
if you're checking
this cell phone.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.717
Are you in town?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.452
I'm a bit confused...

05:51.485 --> 05:52.920
Call me back at the
hospital, okay?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.988
I'll be here for
another hour or so.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.558
You ran away
from your back pain guy,

05:57.591 --> 05:58.926
but he's waiting for you.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.428
He can wait.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.067
I heard Michael was here.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.836
Did you know he was coming?

06:08.869 --> 06:09.970
Yeah, sure.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.039
You didn't mention it.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.040
Didn't I?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.610
He didn't stop by?

06:16.644 --> 06:19.447
I guess he just didn't want
to go over everything.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.148
Should I continue
being oblivious,

06:21.181 --> 06:22.616
or do you want to explain

06:22.650 --> 06:24.585
why you're bleeding
from your cuticles?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.520
I'm not crazy, am I?

06:26.554 --> 06:27.455
Crazy?

06:27.455 --> 06:28.556
How did I manage

06:28.589 --> 06:30.157
to build up feelings
for someone

06:30.190 --> 06:32.460
I've spoken to once
in the past year?

06:32.460 --> 06:34.462
Well, you exchanged letters.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.764
Letters?

06:36.797 --> 06:38.098
What are letters?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.467
You can think, feel,

06:39.467 --> 06:41.201
say whatever the
hell you want

06:41.234 --> 06:43.571
in a letter to someone
thousands of miles away.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.640
It's all speculative, imagined.

06:46.674 --> 06:49.477
It doesn't mean anything,
it's just on a piece of paper.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.744
It's okay
if you're mad at him...

06:50.778 --> 06:52.480
Mad?!

06:52.513 --> 06:54.815
More like furious.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.216
I'm furious
that he didn't tell me

06:56.249 --> 06:57.985
he was coming.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.053
I'm furious that he could just
walk away like that.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.922
I'm ridiculously

07:01.955 --> 07:03.657
desperate to see him.

07:03.691 --> 07:06.627
None of which is based
on anything more substantial

07:06.660 --> 07:09.229
than the inner workings
of my neurotic brain.

07:09.262 --> 07:13.200
You know, I was ready
to bestow my sage wisdom, but...

07:13.233 --> 07:15.135
I think you got it covered.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.041
Am I so pathetic

07:21.074 --> 07:23.043
that I have to
concoct a love life

07:23.076 --> 07:24.812
out of nothing?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.580
That's not fair.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.048
You and Michael were very close.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.517
It's not so crazy

07:29.550 --> 07:31.018
that you're having
these feelings.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.974
( heavy sigh )

08:12.993 --> 08:15.796
Graze wound
to the right testicle.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.898
It's just superficial.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.867
Victor, you're a lucky man.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.101
PRATT:
GSW to the

08:21.134 --> 08:24.137
right thigh,
no exit.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.906
Belly's soft.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.274
What happened here?

08:27.307 --> 08:29.209
I got hurt last summer.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.745
Victor, you got shot before?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.080
Just some kid at school.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.648
I'm not that popular.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.883
Victor?

08:35.916 --> 08:36.984
Hey, Mom.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.150
Thank God you're all right.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.587
What happened?

08:39.620 --> 08:40.788
Well, your
12-year-old son

08:40.821 --> 08:42.890
had a 9mm pistol
in his pocket.

08:42.923 --> 08:43.857
He did?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.026
Do you know where he got it?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.194
No.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.597
Mrs. Hopkins,

08:49.630 --> 08:51.131
who's the gun belong to?

08:51.164 --> 08:54.602
Boo, I taught you how
to keep the safety on.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.971
Oh, Neela.
!
Oh, I'm sorry,
Dr. Lewis.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.239
I'm getting to
him right now.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.774
Oh, wow. Am I that much
of a hard ass?

09:00.808 --> 09:02.610
I was going to ask you
if you'd seen Gallant.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.077
Uh, no. Sorry. Uh,
patient's waiting.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.613
Can you sign off
on an order

09:05.646 --> 09:06.947
of Ancef
for Victor Hopkins?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.148
The prepubescent
gangbanger?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.717
More like aspiring
vigilante.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.918
And his mom's behind it.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.085
What?!

09:12.119 --> 09:13.120
She gave him the gun.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.321
Get social services down.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.989
And, um, Sam,
somebody called for you.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.324
Who?

09:17.357 --> 09:18.959
Well, uh,
he didn't leave a name,

09:18.992 --> 09:20.961
and he sounded a bit agitated,
and Frank said

09:20.994 --> 09:22.730
that you got a similar call
yesterday?

09:22.763 --> 09:24.231
Yeah. I, uh, took care
of this wheelchair vet

09:24.264 --> 09:25.633
with ascites last week.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.867
Kind of got a
thing for me.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.301
Do you want me
to put security on alert?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.103
No, no. It's nothing
like that, thanks.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.071
It's fine. Really.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.339
Okay.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.709
What's going on?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.711
Oh, a patient wants me
on the phone.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.212
Sam, what's
going on?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.881
Nothing. What?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.650
You don't want
to tell me?

09:42.650 --> 09:43.917
Fine.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.687
Hey...

09:46.720 --> 09:49.122
Come on,
let's get a coffee, okay?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.158
Have you been taking the
ibuprofen, like we discussed?

09:51.191 --> 09:52.359
KIRKENDALL:
Yes.
Resting?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.027
Trying.
Well, like I said yesterday,

09:54.061 --> 09:55.062
and the day before that...

09:55.095 --> 09:56.730
No, it was Tuesday, actually,

09:56.764 --> 09:57.765
'cause I couldn't come
Wednesday. I got busy.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.199
Okay, a muscle spasm like this

09:59.232 --> 10:00.400
can take weeks to heal.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.835
Oh, I know.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.303
So why do you keep coming back?

10:05.072 --> 10:06.674
I believe in you,

10:06.707 --> 10:08.809
and I keep thinking
maybe you can fix me.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.913
All right, let's do a full exam.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.225
Uh, it's a unitard.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.294
You know, like a bodysuit.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.096
Okay, I'm going
to step away

10:29.129 --> 10:32.800
and let you take that off
and get into a gown, okay?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.241
Uh...

10:41.274 --> 10:42.275
( clears throat )

10:42.309 --> 10:44.211
I can't,
I can't do it.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.849
Why not?

10:50.417 --> 10:53.120
Mr. Kirkendall, do you want me
to help you or not?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.889
Look, don't laugh, okay?

10:55.923 --> 10:57.124
Okay?

10:57.157 --> 10:58.225
Okay.

11:00.928 --> 11:04.331
My wife used to call
me, um, uh, Clark,

11:04.364 --> 11:05.933
as in Clark Kent.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.300
Look, I can't examine
you properly

11:07.334 --> 11:08.435
unless you undress...

11:08.468 --> 11:10.137
She said she could
see through my,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.304
you know,
everyday disguise,

11:11.338 --> 11:13.006
and underneath my
unassuming facade,

11:13.040 --> 11:15.042
there was, uh, there
was something else...

11:15.075 --> 11:16.176
Something else?

11:16.209 --> 11:20.147
A, uh... a secret strength.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.083
A special person.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.252
The power of a locomotive.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.386
Mr. Kirkendall...

11:26.419 --> 11:27.888
On Tuesday

11:27.921 --> 11:29.757
it'll be 19 weeks
since she died.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.293
I'm sorry.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.800
Allergic to nuts and, uh,

11:39.833 --> 11:43.804
accidentally ate an almond
in someone's birthday cake.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.106
That's awful.

11:46.139 --> 11:50.143
So, after she passed,
I bought the suit,

11:50.177 --> 11:54.114
and I wear it under my clothes
on the really bad days,

11:54.147 --> 11:56.483
and, uh, I don't know,
it makes me feel, uh...

11:58.819 --> 11:59.920
better.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.457
You weren't
wearing it yesterday.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.393
Oh, yesterday was a good day.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.302
You think I'm crazy.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.237
Uh, well, I wouldn't say that.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.939
Oh, you think I'm crazy.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.108
No, I think...

12:21.141 --> 12:23.811
I think I can examine you
over your suit.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.451
I wasn't sure
what the calls were

12:31.484 --> 12:33.453
until Alex told me about
the letter this morning.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.487
So he's here.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.823
I guess so.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.991
What do you
want to do?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.160
I'm not going to
run away again.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.129
Especially not now.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.432
I don't want you to have
to worry, it's my problem.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.434
I kind of think
it's our problem.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.438
I'm Dr. Carter.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.006
What do you got, Dr. Pratt?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.174
12-year-old,

12:54.207 --> 12:56.143
GSW to the thigh.
Vitals stable.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.477
Waiting on
an X ray.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.479
And a social work consult.
The kid had a pistol.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.348
He's too smart
for his own good.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.383
Bullies tease him, he
mouths off right back.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.985
He tell you what
happened last year?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.121
Tony Ramsey,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.190
the biggest doof at my school,

13:10.223 --> 13:13.927
told him he won a Darwin award
for the most inbred.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.562
( chuckling )

13:15.595 --> 13:17.464
I didn't think
he'd actually shoot me.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.867
He shot you at school?

13:19.867 --> 13:21.501
No, on my way home.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.037
Kid went to juvie, was back
in class four months later.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.206
Still, a gun's not the answer.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.307
I didn't know
what else to do.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.242
9mm
in the femoral triangle.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.110
Pulse is weak.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.244
I'll page Angio.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.880
We may not have time for that.

13:32.880 --> 13:33.881
What's wrong?

13:33.914 --> 13:34.882
He's going to need surgery.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.050
Surgery? Again?

13:37.084 --> 13:38.218
'Fraid so.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.020
Curtain Four
has a biliary colic.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.221
Ultrasound and lipase
are normal.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.455
Better after
two of morphine.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.157
Okay, home and
follow up with PMD.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.525
Uh, DUB
has settled down,

13:45.558 --> 13:47.227
and going home
with GYN follow-up.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.595
And in Curtain Two,
I've got the...

13:48.628 --> 13:49.362
You mean, the superhero

13:49.396 --> 13:50.463
over there?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.464
Yeah, a
repeat customer

13:51.498 --> 13:52.900
with lower back pain.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.101
No reproducible
paraspinal tenderness...

13:54.134 --> 13:55.235
Hey, is it true
what I just heard?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.904
Is Gallant back?
...and, uh, uh...

13:56.904 --> 13:58.171
That's the rumor,
but nobody's seen him.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.272
...normal neuro exam.
Is he drug-seeking?

13:59.306 --> 14:00.273
Probably went
to see his parents.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.541
I just think
he's lonely.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.543
I've got him on
round the clock ibuprofen

14:03.576 --> 14:04.644
and gave him a referral
for grief counseling.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.113
Neela, is that right?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.247
Gallant's parents,
they in Texas?

14:07.280 --> 14:08.248
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I believe so.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.516
Is that it?

14:09.549 --> 14:11.251
I don't really know much
about his parents.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.920
I meant the patient.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.187
Oh, no, that's it.
Okay.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.223
Coffee and
a jelly donut, please.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.425
Same thing every day, Doc.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.527
Try a cruller.
Crullers are nice.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.462
I'll stick to the donut,
thank you.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.396
I didn't even know
you were coming.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.599
Ah, Jamila was,
uh, touch and go.

14:59.632 --> 15:03.170
My CO sent me at
the last minute.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.305
You didn't call?

15:05.338 --> 15:08.608
We were only in Germany
for about an hour or so...

15:08.641 --> 15:10.310
I meant today.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.179
Dubenko told me you
left, so I thought...

15:12.212 --> 15:14.581
I just... I had
to do something.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.421
But I couldn't leave
without seeing you.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.294
I mean, I thought it might
be easier that way, but...

15:29.162 --> 15:30.397
but I couldn't.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.103
Everyone's sad
you didn't come by.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.006
( sighs )

15:39.039 --> 15:41.141
It's just it...

15:41.174 --> 15:44.211
I mean, it feels
weird, you know,

15:44.244 --> 15:46.213
being back
in the world.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.614
The thought of
going into the E.R.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.349
and having to answer

15:49.382 --> 15:51.618
all those questions
about, you know, what I'm doing,

15:51.651 --> 15:53.553
and what it's
like over there...

15:53.586 --> 15:55.488
How long can you stay?

15:55.522 --> 15:57.557
I fly back out tomorrow morning.

15:57.590 --> 16:01.728
I only came to make sure
the girl got here safely.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.097
( cell phone ringing )

16:05.298 --> 16:06.666
Hello?

16:06.699 --> 16:10.037
I left all the orders on
the chart, it's all there.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.140
I'm at... lunch, Frank.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.541
At Ike's.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.309
No, I can't come back.
He'll be fine.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.115
What happened there?

16:22.149 --> 16:25.152
Uh... nothing.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.388
It's just a...
just a little gash.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.523
( pager beeping )

16:37.297 --> 16:39.732
This morning I went to, uh...

16:42.702 --> 16:45.605
I went to see the family
of a guy I knew from Iraq.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.644
He died right before I left.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.251
And I-I, uh...

17:00.120 --> 17:03.356
I brought something
that he got for his daughter.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.157
I'm sorry.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.500
Monday, his wife

17:16.103 --> 17:21.608
saw two men walking,
uh... towards her door

17:21.641 --> 17:23.542
in dress uniforms.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.149
She begged them to go away,

17:29.182 --> 17:33.720
told them, uh, told them that
they must have the wrong house.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.226
But they didn't.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.432
And she, uh, she knew why...

17:47.500 --> 17:49.236
she knew why they were there.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.647
( breathes deeply )

18:00.680 --> 18:02.615
She knew.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.357
Neela's superhero
won't leave.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.758
What's
the problem?

18:11.791 --> 18:12.859
He won't say.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.594
Want me to
call security?

18:14.627 --> 18:17.564
Hey, um, do you think maybe
someone could page her?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.266
You know what,
I'm sorry.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.733
She's home in bed.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.735
No she's not.
She's over at Ike's.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.171
Well, who's Ike?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.605
I mean, maybe we could call him?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.742
Why don't I see
if I can track her down.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.644
Thanks.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.747
MAN:
Hey, you got a hot nurse
here named Samantha Taggart?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.883
Yeah, what's your name?

18:36.916 --> 18:38.785
Steve. Steve Curtis.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.187
It's okay, Frank.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.388
I got this.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.323
You still
hanging in there?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.192
Looking for Sam?

18:45.192 --> 18:46.593
Yeah, I can't
believe she's lasted

18:46.626 --> 18:48.261
over a year
in this place.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.896
Do you need some water
or something?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.598
If she hasn't
run off by now,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.800
you must have her
chained to a bed or something.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.535
Let's step over here
for a minute.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.736
PRATT:
But seriously,
how long

18:56.769 --> 18:58.238
do I have to wait
for these scans?

18:58.271 --> 18:59.439
I need those now.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.873
Hey, Olivia.
I'll call you back.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.342
Hey, I wanted
to tell you

19:02.375 --> 19:03.810
I was very impressed
with what you said

19:03.843 --> 19:04.677
to that kid
back there.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.878
Thanks.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.414
And I was wondering
if I could

19:07.447 --> 19:09.316
talk to you about
another patient of mine.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.350
This 12-year-old kid,

19:10.383 --> 19:11.451
he came in with a gun.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.652
Unfortunately,

19:12.685 --> 19:13.820
that doesn't surprise me.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.755
No, but this is a smart kid.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.857
Not a tough guy,
not yet.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.794
And I was hoping, you know,
you could, uh, do your thing.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.830
My thing?

19:23.863 --> 19:26.466
( chuckles )

19:26.499 --> 19:29.336
Wow. Somebody's
been practicing.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.739
I didn't like the way
you ran the table last time.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.309
Wait, wait,
hold on a second.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.644
What?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.546
I'm your bridge.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.814
Go ahead,
you can reach.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.923
I hope you're not about
to get too competitive,

19:50.957 --> 19:53.326
because it looks as if
I'm about to beat you.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.861
Michael.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.296
Hey.
Hi.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.864
Abby, hi.
Hey.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.532
Thought you left already.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.335
Well, not exactly.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.371
How's it going?

20:04.404 --> 20:06.239
Uh...

20:07.907 --> 20:09.776
That's a tough one
to answer, I guess.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.711
Yeah, how you been?

20:11.744 --> 20:13.346
Very good.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.289
Yeah, uh, I came by, uh,
to try to bring you back

20:22.322 --> 20:23.423
for that Kirkendall guy,

20:23.456 --> 20:24.791
but I'll just
take care of it.

20:24.824 --> 20:25.992
Thank you.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.994
Are you going
to stop by?

20:28.027 --> 20:31.731
Um, I'm not sure.
Say I said hi.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.335
It's good
to see you.
Yeah.

20:35.368 --> 20:38.305
And, uh, I hope you know
that we all think about you.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.673
Yeah, me, too.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.941
Okay.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.847
I know it's a bad thing,

20:47.880 --> 20:49.949
but I'm just trying to
level the playing field.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.884
They all have weapons
at his school.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.653
PRATT:
After what happened
today, you really want

20:53.686 --> 20:55.755
your little boy walking
around with a gun?

20:55.788 --> 20:57.924
Give us a minute to talk...
Look, Victor was
shot last year.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.692
I can't let that
happen again.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.561
It just did.
Excuse me?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.396
I work two jobs.
I can't watch him
every minute.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.598
But he's a good kid.
I can tell.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.934
But... you know what?

21:07.967 --> 21:10.002
A man like you
can be tough

21:10.036 --> 21:13.039
just by staying away
from problem situations.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.041
You got to grow up
so you can be the president

21:15.074 --> 21:17.544
and fix our public schools.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.347
I'd rather be a pilot.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.914
OLIVIA:
Whatever you want,

21:21.948 --> 21:24.484
so long as you don't mess up
your young years.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.354
Avoid those bad kids.
How?

21:27.354 --> 21:29.589
They follow me
on my way to school.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.958
Here's what
we're going to do.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.561
You see that tough guy
over there?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.095
When you get better,

21:36.128 --> 21:37.897
he's going to walk you
to school for a week.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.532
What? Wait...

21:39.566 --> 21:41.368
And if you
give up your gun,

21:41.401 --> 21:43.069
I'll have someone walk you

21:43.102 --> 21:45.638
to and from school
every day after.

21:45.672 --> 21:49.008
And each week your escort
is going to get bigger

21:49.041 --> 21:50.910
and scarier than that guy.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.946
Just point me to her, okay?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.448
I don't need a baby-sitter.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.949
You're not really allowed
to be back here.

21:56.983 --> 21:57.917
We're making an exception.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.386
Wow. Thanks.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.588
There's a lounge
down the hall.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.423
Well, aren't you the man.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.458
Listen, this is
where I work, okay?

22:05.492 --> 22:07.093
I don't want any trouble.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.561
So just get her for me.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.663
She'll be out
as soon as she's free.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.001
Any tingling here?

22:15.034 --> 22:16.403
No.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.771
How about here?

22:18.805 --> 22:19.772
Uh-uh.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.576
Here?
A little.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.046
All right,

22:27.079 --> 22:28.548
here we go, Victor.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.082
I will be your driver today.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.652
Ray...
You can thank me
later, Sam.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.986
Come here for a second.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.456
All right.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.957
Look at this bullet.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.659
There's a chip missing.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.429
Let's talk ballistics
later, all right?

22:42.429 --> 22:44.597
15 minutes is not going
to change his outcome.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.533
Should show this
to Carter.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.867
Hey, Vascular's waiting.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.502
He's got a bounding
popliteal pulse.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.438
Surgeons are all set
to do a femoral repair,

22:51.438 --> 22:53.473
but he's got a fragment
in the popliteal artery.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.675
Well, Victor's got
to be in pre-op
in five minutes,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.044
or they're gonna
cancel the case.
X ray, please.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.179
I just want to make sure
they're not operating
on the wrong side.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.615
They're just going to
figure that out upstairs.
Hi. We need a tech

23:02.649 --> 23:04.016
in Trauma Two
for a right knee.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.720
Okay, come on, we don't
need this, all right?

23:07.754 --> 23:09.556
This is my patient, Sam.
I don't want this.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.057
Yeah, you do.
Show that to Carter.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.091
Make Vascular wait.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.893
Thank you.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.765
She can't be pulled away
while she's with a patient.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.538
STEVE:
Okay, boss, I
think we're done.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.842
It's okay. Thanks.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.010
I got it.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.945
Big guy's
kind of tense.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.993
So it's serious
with this guy?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.929
Yeah, it is.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.832
I'm glad it's
working out for you.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.601
Do you want to talk?

23:54.634 --> 23:57.103
Has anybody been
looking for me?

23:57.136 --> 23:58.938
No.
Nobody's contacted you?

23:58.971 --> 24:00.172
Why?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.741
Never mind.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.810
Steve, what'd you do?

24:03.843 --> 24:05.945
Nothing. Noth... I just...

24:05.978 --> 24:07.947
I-I owe a guy some money.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.916
Could I...

24:09.949 --> 24:11.684
could I borrow
some cash?

24:11.718 --> 24:12.919
Steve...

24:12.952 --> 24:15.955
I n... I need it.
I do, Sam.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.958
I-I'm going to take Alex
on a little trip, okay?

24:18.991 --> 24:21.227
What?
I may... I may not
see him for a while,

24:21.260 --> 24:23.062
and I'd like to spend
some time with him.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.597
He's in school.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.965
What is he, third grade?

24:25.998 --> 24:28.034
So he'll miss
finger painting class.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.837
He's in the fifth grade;
he's studying the Constitution.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.972
But he's still my kid, right?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.907
Please, Steve?

24:34.941 --> 24:36.909
You know it's a bad idea.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.813
Yeah, I guess you're right.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.252
Hey, look, if you want,
maybe the three of us

24:46.285 --> 24:48.821
could go get some dessert
or something together.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.923
You could catch up with him
a little bit.

24:50.957 --> 24:51.924
He'd like that.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.560
Yeah.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.262
I got to hit the road.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.566
I'll... I'll just
call him, 'kay?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.703
But, uh...

25:03.736 --> 25:05.137
what about the money?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.308
I think I only have
about $40 on me.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.943
How much do you need?

25:10.977 --> 25:13.713
A couple hundred
would be good.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.982
Come on, there's an ATM
around the corner.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.284
So, you still having
a bad time at, uh, at work?

25:18.317 --> 25:20.653
Oh, I'm sure I
overstated it.

25:20.687 --> 25:24.624
It's just I came to work here
and fell into old patterns,

25:24.657 --> 25:26.125
from college,
from growing up

25:26.158 --> 25:28.761
and all the stuff I
wanted to get away from.

25:28.795 --> 25:31.598
I mean, one day you realize
that's how people see you,

25:31.631 --> 25:33.132
that's who you are to them,

25:33.165 --> 25:34.967
even if that's not
who you want to be.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.806
So you don't like
who you are?

25:39.839 --> 25:41.941
I don't always like
how people see me.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.275
Ah.

25:43.309 --> 25:46.145
You can change that.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.080
Be someone different
tomorrow.

25:49.682 --> 25:50.983
Come on.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.819
What?
Where are we going?

25:52.852 --> 25:54.687
Millennium Park-- it's new--

25:54.721 --> 25:56.623
and then I'm taking
you to dinner.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.960
Dr. Kovac, can
I talk to you?

26:00.993 --> 26:02.662
Sure, Frank.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.664
I know it's none
of my business.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.965
I was a cop,
and I can still

26:05.998 --> 26:07.834
sniff out a skel
when I see one.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.135
Guy's name is
Curtis, right?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.837
Yeah.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.639
A detective I
know at the 1-5

26:12.639 --> 26:13.973
checked the NCIC for me.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.274
NCIC?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.276
National Crime
Information Center.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.311
He pulled up this arrest
warrant from Colorado.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.847
I thought you should know.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.014
Thanks, Frank.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.050
Is the film back on my GSW kid?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.351
Uh, not sure.

26:25.384 --> 26:26.786
Pratt and Ray are
in with him now.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.120
You okay?
Yeah.

26:28.154 --> 26:29.889
Where's Steve?
Gone. It's all right.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.357
He just wanted
some money.
No, there's something else

26:31.390 --> 26:32.859
we need to talk about.
I saw something
on TV once

26:32.892 --> 26:34.293
where they cut
the wrong leg off.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.695
Nobody's
cutting your leg off.
Just a minute, okay?

26:35.728 --> 26:37.196
ALICE:
Do I have
to sign something?

26:37.229 --> 26:38.865
RAY:
Anesthesia
has the consent forms upstairs.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.767
Where
are you guys going?
To the O.R.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.268
No, we have to wait
for the results of Victor's...

26:42.301 --> 26:43.703
X ray.

26:43.736 --> 26:44.871
You were right.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.038
Bullet fragment in
the popliteal fossa.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.239
Nice catch, Sam.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.075
Vascular's scrubbed
and waiting.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.410
My mom says I can eat ice cream
for dinner after I wake up.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.780
Yeah? Well,
your mom is pretty cool.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.716
Thanks for everything.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.685
Yeah. Ditto that.

26:58.685 --> 26:59.852
Anytime.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.225
Alex left school
with Erica.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.194
Yeah, she's
tutoring him today.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.896
Frank got this.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.731
It's about Steve.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.899
What, you had Frank
snoop on Steve?

27:12.932 --> 27:14.901
He just did it.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.169
He robbed a market
outside Denver.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.872
A cashier got hurt.

27:19.906 --> 27:22.208
What?

27:22.241 --> 27:24.410
Oh, my...

27:24.443 --> 27:25.912
I mean, he's gotten
in trouble before,

27:25.945 --> 27:27.213
but nothing like this.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.915
We should call the police.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.182
No, I can't...

27:30.216 --> 27:31.951
He's Alex's Dad.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.953
I can't be responsible
for getting him locked up.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.723
Oh, Sam, I need you to work
a couple hours of overtime.

27:36.723 --> 27:37.924
I lost my MICN.
I can't.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.258
I need someone
who can work the radio.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.392
Yeah, I'm sorry,
Dr. Lewis.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.761
It's just
till Chuny gets in.

27:41.794 --> 27:42.762
She's stuck on the I-90.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.196
Yeah, I know, but...

27:44.230 --> 27:45.231
Hey, come on, Sam,
I've cut you some breaks.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.133
Help me out here.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.935
Hey, Susan, I'm going to take
the sled collision in Two.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.937
Oh, okay, wait.
Thanks, Sam.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.405
It's okay, I'll
go straight home.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.107
All right.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.909
Call me
as soon as you get there, okay?

27:56.943 --> 27:58.144
Okay.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.447
So, Chuck and I
have basically

28:01.480 --> 28:03.482
been hibernating for a year
with Cosmo,

28:03.515 --> 28:06.285
and I'm trying to get us
to reenter the social world.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.187
So I was thinking
that maybe you and Wendall

28:08.220 --> 28:09.956
could come over sometime
for dinner.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.290
If you don't mind

28:11.323 --> 28:12.959
talking over
the static of a baby monitor.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.226
Oh, that's a
really nice offer.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.028
Yeah, I'd love to.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.098
But things with, uh,
Wendall didn't work out.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.133
Oh. I'm sorry.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.835
Yeah, it's weird.

28:22.869 --> 28:26.072
She's actually not really
even speaking to me.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.807
Are you all right?

28:27.840 --> 28:29.776
Yeah, I'm good.
I-I'm fine.

28:29.809 --> 28:30.977
I just, um...

28:31.010 --> 28:32.078
Just what?

28:33.479 --> 28:35.481
I don't know.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.817
I just kind of feel
like lately I've...

28:37.850 --> 28:39.852
fallen off the tracks.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.288
It's taken me a little while
to figure how to get back on.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.391
Will you
call the office later

28:45.424 --> 28:46.793
and let me know
how Victor's doing?

28:46.793 --> 28:48.227
You got it.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.062
After he's discharged
we'll set up a schedule

28:50.096 --> 28:51.330
for you to walk Victor
to school.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.099
You weren't serious
about that.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.001
I'm serious about everything
I say to these kids.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.335
Um, I'm kinda busy.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.004
We're all busy, Dr. Pratt.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.006
So, what, you going
to stamp out violence in Chicago

29:00.039 --> 29:01.173
one kid at a time?

29:01.207 --> 29:02.474
That's the plan.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.010
( Pratt sighs )

29:04.043 --> 29:05.311
It's like
any other epidemic.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.013
How do you contain TB?

29:07.046 --> 29:08.347
Knock on doors
and give out meds.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.382
You stop the flu
by giving out vaccine shots

29:10.416 --> 29:12.184
on street corners.
It's the same thing.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.853
Yeah, but there's no
meds and no vaccine.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.054
The kids I know
who carry guns,

29:15.087 --> 29:16.355
you can't talk
them out of it.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.190
We react
to every single shooting

29:18.224 --> 29:19.826
even if no one gets hurt.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.928
We mobilize
a neighborhood response

29:21.961 --> 29:23.930
every time
someone fires a gun.

29:23.963 --> 29:28.034
Stigmatize violence
and death rates will drop.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.102
It sounds good.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.204
It's working.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.240
Come by
and see for yourself.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.842
The address is on the card.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.181
It looks like
a frat house.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.851
Yeah, it's definitely
lived-in.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.252
That's what you get

29:46.285 --> 29:48.254
for rooming with a
rock and roll resident.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.422
Where are you
staying tonight?

29:50.456 --> 29:54.593
Uh, a buddy of mine
took over my old lease.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.264
I'm probably going
to sack out there.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.999
I'm hungry. Are you?

30:00.032 --> 30:02.368
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.137
Well, I'll just go
and get changed then.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.006
Me, too.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.341
I could use walking around
in some civvies for awhile.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.610
Okay, well,
I'll be back in a minute.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.879
Okay.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.151
What are you craving?

30:19.185 --> 30:21.320
What's that?

30:21.353 --> 30:23.322
What kind of food
do you want?

30:23.355 --> 30:26.325
Chinese, deep dish,

30:26.358 --> 30:27.994
burgers?

30:28.027 --> 30:29.929
Uh, deep dish
sounds good.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.935
Or, uh, Thai.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.104
There's this great place
on Indiana.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.339
Yeah, yeah. You know,
whatever you think is good.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.118
( tailgate slams shut )

30:59.558 --> 31:01.593
I'm just picking up
some of my stuff.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.464
You broke into
our apartment?

31:05.497 --> 31:07.299
Alex let me in.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.401
Where is he?
Upstairs.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.937
Where's the baby-sitter?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.571
I sent her home.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.007
Okay. Put it all back.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.175
What?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.110
It doesn't
belong to you.

31:19.678 --> 31:22.314
You see this?

31:22.348 --> 31:24.083
I gave her this.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.617
Okay?

31:28.587 --> 31:30.957
What about the TV
and the stereo?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.959
You keep whatever you want.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.333
I'll go check on Alex.

31:41.367 --> 31:42.501
Alex is fine.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.669
I'll go see.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.004
No.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.641
You don't want to do that.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.982
( strained grunting )

31:57.083 --> 31:58.484
ALEX:
Luka.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.056
It's nothing, kiddo.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.657
Just a little disagreement.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.161
What's all that for?

32:09.195 --> 32:11.297
Dad's taking
me to Florida.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.232
We're going to get a
bungalow by the beach

32:13.265 --> 32:14.700
and watch
the whales migrate.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.702
Mom said it was okay.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.138
Alex, go back up.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.472
No.

32:20.506 --> 32:21.707
Alex, now!

32:21.740 --> 32:23.509
Easy hoss,
not your kid.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.611
Listen, you can take
whatever you want,

32:25.644 --> 32:27.246
I don't care,

32:27.279 --> 32:29.015
but he's not going
anywhere with you.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.752
Think about it.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.521
You really want to get
him into all that?

32:47.633 --> 32:50.569
Hey, we'll catch the whales
in the fall, kiddo.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.371
I'm going the other direction.
What?

32:52.404 --> 32:54.306
Come on, now,
don't be upset.
You said we'd...

32:54.340 --> 32:56.642
You said we're going
to go to Florida.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.477
You can't miss
that much school.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.113
Doc here's
got a point.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.115
We'll do it next time.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.057
Come on, buddy,

33:11.057 --> 33:13.059
don't make this
harder on me.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.066
That's right.

33:48.527 --> 33:49.595
Wow.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.465
If that's your
deep dish pizza outfit,

33:53.499 --> 33:55.234
I'm glad
I didn't say French food.

33:55.267 --> 33:58.370
Let me just, uh,
turn off the light.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.697
( inhales sharply )

34:56.795 --> 34:58.730
*

35:29.761 --> 35:31.430
( moans )

35:31.463 --> 35:34.333
It's pretty.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.435
Can't sleep?

35:36.468 --> 35:37.803
Nah.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.741
Does it hurt?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.876
No, not really.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.345
What happened?

35:49.715 --> 35:52.851
There was a, uh,
a patient brought in...

35:55.821 --> 35:59.225
he was part of a unit
that got caught in a firefight.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.430
They had men down, they needed
help getting them out alive.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.566
( rapid gunfire )

36:07.599 --> 36:09.301
Get him out of here! Quick!

36:09.335 --> 36:11.403
( rapid gunfire )

36:11.437 --> 36:14.573
GALLANT:
I never thought
I'd be in the middle of it.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.709
( yells )

36:17.743 --> 36:19.545
We'll cover you!
Get going!

36:19.578 --> 36:21.780
But there I was.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.817
And all I cared about

36:25.851 --> 36:27.753
was getting
us both the hell out of there.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.593
( rapid gunfire )

36:38.530 --> 36:40.566
( yells )

36:40.599 --> 36:42.401
( panting )

36:43.902 --> 36:47.606
Three of our men
died there that day.

36:47.639 --> 36:50.442
I don't know how many Iraqis.

36:52.511 --> 36:53.845
( gunshots )

36:53.879 --> 36:55.947
( rapid gunfire )

37:01.353 --> 37:03.322
It's funny,
what you were saying earlier

37:03.355 --> 37:06.925
about, uh, wanting to be...
someone different.

37:09.595 --> 37:12.298
I keep wishing
I could go back to who I was.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.403
All we can do
is keep moving forward.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.549
I wish you didn't
have to go back.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.652
It won't be too long
before I'm home for good.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.755
They're in 3-L?

37:36.788 --> 37:38.924
Yeah, burn unit.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.433
Morning.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.800
Morning, uh, Dr. Gallant.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.035
I didn't realize
we'd see you again.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.703
Yeah, I'm just
on my way back.

37:51.737 --> 37:52.838
Uh, Hayat,

37:52.871 --> 37:54.573
this is, uh,
Dr. Rasgotra.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.707
Neela.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.042
DUBENKO:
We were able to lighten

37:57.075 --> 37:58.677
her sedation
for a few minutes.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.579
She squeezed her mom's hand.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.580
( pager beeping )

38:01.613 --> 38:03.815
Um, sorry.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.451
It's the E.R.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.487
I'll be right back.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.655
I'll be a minute.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.757
Probably forgot
to sign a chart.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.794
Okay, uh... yeah,
I'll wait right here.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.996
Why don't you come down?
Abby's there and Pratt.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.065
I don't have a lot of time.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.368
Okay, I'll come get you.

38:28.940 --> 38:29.975
CHUNY:
Systolic's down to 60.

38:30.008 --> 38:30.876
CARTER:
Fluids wide open.

38:30.909 --> 38:31.943
Hang two of O-neg,

38:31.977 --> 38:33.379
and type and cross
for four more.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.680
LOCKHART:
I'm in,
pass me the bag.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.615
Oh, no. I saw him
yesterday, he was fine.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.850
LOCKHART:
Never left, he just signed
in again at the triage desk.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.452
Got good breath sounds,
let's call X ray.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.854
Aorta's dilated,
abdomen's full of blood.

38:42.888 --> 38:43.955
What happened?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.123
Looks like
a ruptured triple-A.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.525
All right,
prep the chest.

38:46.558 --> 38:47.793
Thoracotomy
tray to Dr. Pratt.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.461
His pain was musculoskeletal.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.662
Bradycardic, 58.

38:50.696 --> 38:51.763
Mig of atropine.

38:51.797 --> 38:52.998
Come on, get the
blood on the rapid

38:53.031 --> 38:54.065
infuser right now.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.401
PRATT:
Ten blade.
I missed it.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.835
Well, he's a young guy

38:56.868 --> 38:58.570
with no risk factors,
it's an atypical

38:58.604 --> 38:59.638
presentation.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.839
Well, I could have done a CT.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.140
Nobody would have done that.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.141
CARTER:
Never lost a pulse,

39:03.174 --> 39:04.543
he's got a shot.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.544
PRATT:
Let's go, Neela.
Get sterile.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.848
( knocking )

39:17.756 --> 39:19.124
I didn't know
you were up.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.096
I know you're mad.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.766
And I know that
he's your father,

39:27.799 --> 39:30.001
and nothing's
gonna change that.

39:30.035 --> 39:34.773
But you and me and Luka,
we're a team now, right?

39:34.806 --> 39:36.708
We're in this
together.

39:36.742 --> 39:40.145
And last night, he had
to make a decision.

39:43.749 --> 39:46.918
And what he did, he did
because it was best for you

39:46.952 --> 39:48.887
and that was
the right thing,

39:48.920 --> 39:50.856
whether or not
you like it.

39:50.889 --> 39:51.957
I have to pee.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.693
Hey, come here.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.162
Talk to me, okay?

39:57.195 --> 40:00.098
I know you're sad
and that's okay.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.035
( sobbing )

40:07.739 --> 40:09.575
LOCKHART:
Subclavian's in,
good flush.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.677
Run in a liter while
we wait for the other blood.

40:11.710 --> 40:12.744
This clamp
keeps slipping.

40:12.778 --> 40:13.745
Try the DeBakey?

40:13.779 --> 40:14.913
Already did.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.114
LOCKHART:
Systolic's down to 54.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.148
Chuny, can you
get the burn unit

40:17.182 --> 40:18.216
on the line for me, please?

40:18.249 --> 40:19.117
We don't need the burn unit.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.819
No, I know, I just...

40:20.852 --> 40:21.987
Aorta' s flat.
He's bleeding out.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.522
Okay team, this is a race.

40:23.555 --> 40:24.856
Let's get that blood up
as fast as we can,

40:24.890 --> 40:26.625
let's up the dopa to 20
and stand by with epi.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.159
It's the O.R., they want
to know when he's coming.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.929
We're not gonna transfer him
until he's cross-clamped.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.498
I'll make sure they
got a team ready.
!
Neela, come here.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.032
Hold the descending aorta, okay?
Don't let go.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.100
LOCKHART:
Neela, I can do that.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.668
It's okay.

40:36.702 --> 40:37.736
I got it.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.673
PRATT:
Oh, look who's here.

40:41.707 --> 40:42.808
CARTER:
Pratt, call for FFP

40:42.841 --> 40:44.710
and cryo,
he's going to need it.

40:46.512 --> 40:47.613
( chuckling ):
Big Mike.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.014
I knew you'd show.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.482
But you've got
the worst timing, though,

40:50.516 --> 40:51.850
We got a nasty
triple-A in there.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.151
Yeah, I can't
stay anyway.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.853
Hold on.

40:54.886 --> 40:57.022
Yeah, this is Dr. Pratt
in the E.R. No, wait...

40:57.055 --> 40:59.124
I know you're going to let
me buy you a beer, right?

40:59.157 --> 41:00.992
Not this time.
Listen, Greg, I need a favor.

41:01.026 --> 41:04.229
Yeah, I need two units of cryo
and FFP right away. Name it.

41:04.262 --> 41:06.665
Can you give this to Neela?
I gotta go.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.867
No, no, just send it
straight to the O.R.

41:08.900 --> 41:09.868
All right? Thanks.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.269
Uh, what's up?

41:11.302 --> 41:13.839
Tell her not to open
it unless, uh...

41:13.872 --> 41:15.607
unless something
happens to me.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.609
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.580
I just want her
to have it just in case.

41:23.782 --> 41:24.883
You okay, man?

41:24.916 --> 41:26.718
Everything
all right?

41:34.593 --> 41:35.794
CARTER:
Come on,
Pratt, let's go.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.596
He could code on the way.

41:37.629 --> 41:38.964
Dr. Carter.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.932
Hey, Mike,
good to see you.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.300
Take care
of yourself, huh?

41:42.333 --> 41:43.835
All right, back off

41:43.869 --> 41:45.303
the tidal volume,
you'll blow a lung.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.138
LOCKHART:
Systolic's 65.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.774
CARTER:
All right,
crank up the epi.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.868
( engine revving )

42:39.324 --> 42:41.627
( sighs )

43:17.729 --> 43:20.666
( helicopter blades whirring )

43:32.177 --> 43:35.080
( helicopter approaching )

43:36.305 --> 43:42.613
