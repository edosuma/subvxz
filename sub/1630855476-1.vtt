WEBVTT

01:20.497 --> 01:21.790
Isn't it magical?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.753
Sure, Grama.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.130
Though I can't tell
if the bride's wearing

01:28.130 --> 01:30.507
little glass slippers or not.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.135
I bet they were
high school sweethearts.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.388
He proposed to her on a vacation
in Paris.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.308
The engagement ring rolled up
in a pair of his socks.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.767
She's gonna jump off that cake,

01:40.767 --> 01:43.145
and ride off on a pumpkin
any minute.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.942
Oh. Hmm.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.028
I've always loved this place.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.864
They do such wonderful
little weddings here.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.450
I remember when your dad
married your mom.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.076
He was so nervous.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.828
I had to tie his bow tie
for him.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.291
I guess that's one good thing

02:04.291 --> 02:06.501
about having a bum ticker
at my age.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.502
I'll be seeing them both soon.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.089
Grams, please don't talk
like that.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.217
Allan does take good care of me.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.552
He's probably back home,

02:15.552 --> 02:19.014
mixing up my dinner hour
medicinal cocktail right now.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.850
That should buy me
a few more hours.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.852
Save the dramatics
for your readers.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.938
I'd always imagined
I'd keel over at my typewriter.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.732
You still have a typewriter?

02:28.732 --> 02:31.109
Still, it isn't how you die.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.278
- It's how you live.
- Hmm.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.821
I'm proud of my writing.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.158
I'm glad I was able to bring
some happiness to some people.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.243
Even if were a little corny.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.453
Hey.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.246
You are still
Barmont publishing's

02:43.246 --> 02:44.164
number one author.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.875
And I'm most thankful for that.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.710
But I'm most proud
of my granddaughter.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.505
Honey.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.424
I know
it hasn't always been easy

02:54.424 --> 02:57.761
living with a substitute mom
who spent more time with

02:57.761 --> 03:00.430
imaginary heiresses
and farm hands,

03:00.430 --> 03:03.141
and less time at school plays
and birthday parties.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.398
With Mom and Dad gone,
you had to be a mom twice.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.525
Still.

03:14.069 --> 03:17.656
There is one thing
I'd like to see before I go.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.199
Okay, Grams. Come on.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.159
We are not having the marriage
discussion again, are we?

03:21.159 --> 03:23.203
It isn't about marriage.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.705
It's about your happiness.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.833
Whether you're married or not,

03:27.833 --> 03:31.128
I just wanna leave knowing
that you're with someone.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.796
I don't want to have
this conversation.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.464
Not now.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.466
You can't plot out my life
like one of your stories, Grama.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.679
Grams. Grama!

03:40.679 --> 03:42.222
Are you okay?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.348
- Pills.
- Pills!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.770
Here, here!

03:48.770 --> 03:51.106
I just want you to be happy.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.525
Grams, I'm happy!
Take your pill.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.693
With someone.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.404
I... I... I am. I have.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.947
Please. Your pill.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.867
I'm engaged.

04:08.373 --> 04:12.002
-Really?
- I was gonna surprise you today.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.211
I'm engaged.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.629
Does he make you happy?

04:15.714 --> 04:18.175
Yes, so happy.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.470
Mrs. Westmoreland.
Is everything all right?

04:21.470 --> 04:22.762
I think so.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.930
Grams?

04:26.892 --> 04:29.060
I think I'll just get her home.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.698
I'm so sorry.
I should have been there.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.825
No, no, no, no, Allan.
It was a girls' day out.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.787
- Mm.
-Mm-hmm.

04:47.787 --> 04:51.416
All right, come on. Margaret Westmoreland.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.418
What are we going to do
with you?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.756
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.883
You are grounded, young lady.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.345
I'm all right.
Really. I'm all right.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.347
No, Allan. It's okay. I got her.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.683
I'll go steep the tea.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.812
Let's get you inside.

05:12.812 --> 05:13.855
Mm.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.496
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I upset you.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.790
Oh, Grams, no.
I'm... I'm sorry.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.874
I upset you,

05:32.874 --> 05:34.668
and you can't afford
to get upset.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.336
I'm all right now.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.963
Okay.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.297
I have to go.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.132
Wait. You're engaged?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.636
Yeah, Grams. I'm engaged.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.470
I'm happy for you.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.847
Me too. I'll talk to you soon.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.891
I want to meet him.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.894
I got it. See you, sweetie.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.954
Hey, Tray. Shall we get right to the morning madness?

06:10.954 --> 06:12.622
First book is a new one
from Gardner.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.583
Sci-fi, historical fiction, satire hybrid?

06:14.583 --> 06:15.750
-Good morning, Tracey.
- Yes.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.210
Carl wants you to fix
its identity crisis.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.962
Tracey? Tracey.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.338
Carl wanted me
to give this to you.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.631
Okay. Thank you, Connie.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.425
Next, is the Cartwell Saga.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.719
Carl wants you to turn
this epic into a novella.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.596
Take it to the chop shop,
and get the blow torch out.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.264
Hey. I'm just the one
who brings you the jalopies.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.724
You're the one
who makes them run.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.851
How's your grandmother?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.728
Yeah. They're still
not really sure.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.896
The doctors say
she's getting worse.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.399
Could be weeks, could be days.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.151
Oh, Tracey, I'm so sorry.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.611
Yeah.

06:42.611 --> 06:43.612
Though she did perk up
a little bit

06:43.612 --> 06:45.488
after pressing me
on my love life.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.448
Oh?

06:46.448 --> 06:48.575
No, nothing to tell. Just...

06:48.575 --> 06:49.784
A little white lie?

06:49.784 --> 06:52.037
- Yeah.
- Nothing wrong with that.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.538
Sometimes, telling people
what they wanna hear

06:53.538 --> 06:54.998
can be the best medicine.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.292
Yeah. Maybe.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.210
And tell her we all miss her.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.253
This place has been
pretty gloomy

07:00.253 --> 07:01.880
these last few months.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.881
Okay.

07:02.881 --> 07:03.757
Bring it in.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.093
Mm, thank you.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.595
My pleasure, my treasure.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.599
Yeah.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.683
Oh, I need a coffee.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.368
Okay.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.454
Tracey Westmoreland.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.373
Tracey? It's Allan.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.292
Allan? Oh, my God.
What's... what's happened?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.877
Your grandmother made tea.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.923
What? What do you mean?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.633
The other day when you came to visit,

07:46.633 --> 07:47.884
what did you talk about?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.971
Oh, Allan, I'm sorry.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.848
We got on the marriage
discussion again.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.475
I think I may have upset her.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.602
You may have just cured her.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.980
Like I said, she walked
to the kitchen this morning.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.524
Completely unassisted?

08:02.524 --> 08:04.609
And made tea for two!

08:04.609 --> 08:07.028
Wedge of lemon,
the good China.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.780
Oh, glorious!

08:08.780 --> 08:10.448
And the doctors were here.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.701
They say she's responding
to her medication much better.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.704
You... you're kidding.
That's... that's great!

08:15.704 --> 08:18.331
Great? It's a full-on miracle!

08:18.331 --> 08:21.501
We are talkin' Holy Ghost power
over here.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.003
Then she told me
of another little miracle.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.589
She said she's going
to meet a man in your life?

08:26.589 --> 08:28.299
You know,
I'm not one to be morbid,

08:28.299 --> 08:30.051
but I think it's wonderful

08:30.051 --> 08:31.428
that you want
your grandmother's last days

08:31.428 --> 08:34.054
to be filled with joy
by having found joy yourself.

08:34.054 --> 08:37.267
Oh, you're an absolute angel!

08:39.102 --> 08:41.354
You know, if I weren't married, I'd snap you up myself.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.522
Mm. But I guess Hector

08:42.522 --> 08:44.524
would have something to say
about that.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.986
Thanks, Allan. I gotta go.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.571
Can you give my love to Grams?

08:49.571 --> 08:51.322
I will. See you, sweetie!

08:51.322 --> 08:52.490
See ya.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.566
You must be Tracey.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.485
Mm.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.028
Rob Humphries.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.739
You look exactly
like your picture.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.115
It's great to meet you.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.533
-Please.
- May I?

09:39.913 --> 09:40.663
Okay.

09:41.664 --> 09:45.210
So, uh,
tell me about the service.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.461
Right.

09:46.461 --> 09:49.089
Well, Rent-a-Groom deploys
folks like me

09:49.089 --> 09:51.424
for all kinds of circumstances.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.260
Jealous friends, creepy bosses,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.262
amorous coworkers.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.474
We can play boyfriends,
long-lost loves,

09:59.474 --> 10:02.435
right up to full-on fiancés.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.146
Once, I actually played
an overbearing older brother.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.942
Uh, Humphries.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.985
That's your...
that's your last name?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.362
Actually, it's a stage name.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.697
I'm a-- I'm an actor.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.867
And a fan of Casablanca.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.119
I took the name from Bogey.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.163
- Humphrey.
- Bogart. I get it.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.376
Well, I hope you're a fan
of Raiders of the Lost Ark,

10:26.376 --> 10:28.503
because I'm changing your name
to Jones.

10:28.503 --> 10:31.381
Okay. Uh, great.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.591
Well, usually, the agency
supplies the back story,

10:33.591 --> 10:37.720
but I can see you have a very
thick folder there.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.930
Mister Humphries.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.098
Not Jones.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.059
Rob.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.687
I have created
a complete character profile

10:45.687 --> 10:48.606
including a modest job
at a junior accounting firm

10:48.606 --> 10:50.650
and a cabin in the mountains.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.860
May I?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.156
Wow.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.909
There are tabs if you...

11:03.955 --> 11:04.998
Rob Jones it is.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.541
I can live with that

11:06.541 --> 11:08.126
the few days
we'll be working together.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.880
Although, I don't expect you
to memorize everything.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.591
I'll be there, of course,
to keep you on track.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.969
I just--
I need attention to detail.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.681
Okay.
I mean, I love this stuff.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.391
Sounds like fun actually.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.436
Mr. Humphries-- Uh, Mr. Jones.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.062
I wanna be clear with you.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.856
I need this
to go by the numbers,

11:29.856 --> 11:31.733
and in an expeditious manner.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.361
Right. Of course.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.905
Okay.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.282
Do you know
who Margaret Westmoreland is?

11:39.282 --> 11:40.491
The romance writer.

11:40.491 --> 11:44.412
The Cassandra Robards series.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.456
My mom used to read those
when I was a kid.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.665
She loved them.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.541
Hmm.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.463
Ah. Wait. Westmoreland.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.173
Are you related to her?

11:55.173 --> 11:57.050
She is my grandmother, yes.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.134
You kidding me?

11:58.134 --> 12:01.095
-No.
- Wow. Wow. Your grandmother.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.764
Yes.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.726
She is, um...
she's very ill.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.605
Oh, gosh. I'm...
so sorry to hear that.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.398
My parents died
when I was very young.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.776
And Maggie raised me by herself.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.903
Sounds like a--
like an incredible lady.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.325
Well, ever since
I was a little girl,

12:22.325 --> 12:25.328
she one day dreamed
of walking me down the aisle

12:25.328 --> 12:26.579
to marry Mr. Right.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.791
This is Mr. Right.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.084
- Oh.
- With her illness,

12:31.084 --> 12:33.252
she won't be there
for the wedding day.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.088
This is about a couple of weeks
of joy.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.509
She needs to believe completely
in this engagement.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.761
Absolutely.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.846
I assure you,
I will not let you down.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.184
So, when do we start?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.978
Tomorrow...

12:49.978 --> 12:51.437
at my grandmother's house.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.029
Yep?

13:00.029 --> 13:03.491
How is Barmont Publishing's
greatest fixer this morning?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.369
You know, got my head
under the hood of another one.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.079
Ah, well, that's the problem

13:08.079 --> 13:09.831
when you're the best
at something.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.165
You get stuck there.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.834
- Believe me, I know.
-Mm.

13:12.834 --> 13:13.793
Sounds like
you could use a break.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.378
Let me take you to lunch.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.964
I'm afraid it's leftovers
at the desk for me again today.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.632
Mm. Dinner it is then.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.177
In fact, I think it's about time
we popped the cord on that Dom.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.722
I got a good feeling
about this sci-fi series.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.098
I can't.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.474
Hey. Listen.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.477
It was one date.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.354
- It was a mistake.
- I had a great time.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.023
It's not what I mean, Todd.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.816
- We work together.
- I agree.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.443
We work very well together
in fact.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.736
Exactly.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.154
And I would like to keep it
that way.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.114
One drink. Call it a do-over.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.408
I'm going to my grandmother's
house tonight.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.035
Right.

13:47.035 --> 13:47.785
Of course.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.747
How is Maggie doing?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.415
Better surprisingly.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.417
Mm. Mm-hmm.
That is good to hear.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.210
Good to hear.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.130
Amazing to think
that this whole company

13:59.130 --> 14:01.758
started with her first
Cassandra novel 30 years ago.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.925
Thirty-one actually.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.010
Yep.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.595
Everything's gonna change
around here

14:05.595 --> 14:08.181
once I get
the editor-in-chief position.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.349
Hey, but don't worry.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.019
Nothing's gonna change
between you and I.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.604
I need Barmont's best fixer
on my team.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.149
Mm. Okay.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.444
All right. Well...

14:21.444 --> 14:22.987
...back to makin' millions.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.696
Just kidding.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.239
I do pretty well, though.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.618
And, uh... give your grandmother
my best, okay?

14:28.618 --> 14:29.660
You got it.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.749
Can you close my door, Todd,
please? Todd--

14:34.749 --> 14:36.834
Janice! How the heck are ya?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.179
Okay. Thank you.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.307
Are you ready?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.934
- Ready.
- Okay.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.690
Right. Engaged.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.739
Sweetie!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.491
Hi, Allan.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.034
Good evening. I'm...

15:10.034 --> 15:11.953
An absolute dream boat.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.455
Get in here.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.456
Welcome.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.165
Thank you, Allan.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.250
Thank you.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.129
Make yourselves comfortable.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.756
I'll just be in the kitchen eavesdropping.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.436
Cassandra Robards.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.814
Appointment with Destiny.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.858
Grams.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.901
It was my mom's favorite
in the series.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.820
Mine, too!

15:45.820 --> 15:49.365
I had all the framed covers
at the old house.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.618
But it seemed a little vain
to put up 20 books.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.661
I figured one would do.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.954
It's a good one.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.166
Oh!

16:01.711 --> 16:04.255
It's so nice
to finally meet you, Rob.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.132
It's an honor to meet you, Mrs--

16:06.132 --> 16:09.218
Maggie. Call me Maggie.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.303
Maggie.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.433
Hi.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.603
Grams, I mean... you look great!

16:18.603 --> 16:21.022
I feel pretty great, too, kiddo.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.316
This way.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.454
Tea, anyone?

16:36.454 --> 16:37.914
Thank you, Allen.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.165
Of course.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.086
Don't forget your little pair
of teeth, my sweet.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.254
Mm-hmm.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.674
Cheers.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.967
I'll be upstairs,

16:49.967 --> 16:51.552
watching my little murder shows
for a while.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.931
You kids have fun.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.354
I hope you like Earl Grey.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.064
Mm-mm! My favorite.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.734
Help yourself to the strudel.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.779
I baked it fresh this afternoon.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.030
You baked strudel?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.574
Of course.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.117
That's funny.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.036
I don't remember
so much as a single cupcake

17:17.036 --> 17:18.788
on any one of my birthdays.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.664
Thank you.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.374
I pulled it out of the archives.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.667
I found this wonderful,
old Austrian recipe

17:23.667 --> 17:25.086
for pear strudel

17:25.086 --> 17:27.296
when I was doing research
for book four.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.090
One Vienna Summer.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.425
Yes. You read it.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.594
Well, over my mom's shoulder.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.306
Impeccable taste, both of you.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.391
So, your folks,

17:38.391 --> 17:39.433
they'll be coming
to the wedding?

17:40.768 --> 17:43.104
My mom has passed.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.107
And my dad, well,
he's not really in the picture.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.484
I'm sorry to hear about your mother.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.778
I understand
what that kind of loss means.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.198
Thank you.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.950
I know she would
have loved Tracey.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.662
And she would've been thrilled
to be in-laws

17:59.662 --> 18:01.455
with the great
Margaret Westmoreland.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.295
Charming fellow.
Wherever did you find him?

18:07.295 --> 18:09.880
Well, Rob's accounting firm
does some consulting

18:09.880 --> 18:11.507
for the publishing company.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.677
Hmm.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.722
One day, we just kind of fell into each other's arms.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.311
Fell? More like crashed.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.273
The ski hill didn't look
quite so steep from the bottom.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.858
- Ski hill?
-Hmm.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.609
When did you take up skiing?

18:30.609 --> 18:31.819
I--

18:31.819 --> 18:35.531
Whitefish. March.
A beautiful time of year.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.200
You know, I think
it was the early morning glare

18:38.200 --> 18:40.244
off the white mountain caps.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.412
First run of the day.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.955
Pristine powder.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.874
Nothing but the sound
of the wind through the trees.

18:44.874 --> 18:45.625
Just...

18:47.585 --> 18:49.128
Oh, my goodness.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.172
I was racing down the mountain.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.882
The Arctic chill at my back.

18:52.882 --> 18:56.052
And nothing but virgin snow
before me.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.512
As I rounded a bend, a...

18:58.512 --> 19:01.599
a mother deer and her fawn.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.518
I swerved to avoid them,
and then I was in the trees.

19:04.518 --> 19:08.230
Miraculously,
I survived the Alpine chaos,

19:09.690 --> 19:12.401
just to run straight into a pack
of spring break skiers.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.821
I'm a ball of bindings
and goggles.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.573
And when I finally came to rest,

19:17.573 --> 19:19.283
I looked up, and I...

19:21.118 --> 19:22.411
I saw an angel.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.458
Oh, my goodness. Tracey!

19:27.458 --> 19:29.877
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.964
It was just a work thing,
you know?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.550
- Team building.
- Mm.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.094
Hmm.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.137
-Hmm.
- So, she rescued you?

19:42.807 --> 19:44.141
It's perfect.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.768
- Yes.
- Perfect.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.441
The, uh... the, uh,
consulting came later.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.818
You don't speak
like an accountant.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.237
Hmm.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.739
I'm gonna refill the teapot.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.366
Rob...

20:00.366 --> 20:03.994
darling, how about a tour
of the kitchen?

20:03.994 --> 20:05.454
Of course, my love.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.499
Let's go right now.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.712
What on earth are you doing?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.797
Oh, just a little improvising.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.173
Improvising?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.883
Oh, come on, Tracey.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.260
This is Margaret Westmoreland.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.470
She doesn't want tax returns
and office parties.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.764
Okay. Listen, Rob.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.059
I'm not paying you
to be James Bond,

20:27.059 --> 20:29.311
or Heathcliff,
or the king of Siam.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.314
I'm paying you
to be Robert Jones,

20:32.314 --> 20:34.859
accountant, and my fiancé.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.236
If you could just stick
to the script for the next hour,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.320
we can wrap this up,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.781
and both get back
to our own lives.

20:40.781 --> 20:41.824
Okay?

20:41.824 --> 20:44.577
Understood. I apologize.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.162
It won't happen again.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.163
Okay.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.540
Thank you.

20:57.715 --> 21:01.010
"Young man, you're simply too short."

21:01.010 --> 21:02.511
He pops on the casting director's

21:02.511 --> 21:05.097
high heel shoes,
turns to me, and said,

21:05.097 --> 21:06.348
"How do you like me now?"

21:09.810 --> 21:11.979
Unbelievable!

21:11.979 --> 21:14.231
I didn't realize
you had a say in casting.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.193
How many of your books
did they adapt?

21:17.193 --> 21:20.696
Oh, I don't know.
A dozen, I think.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.740
Simply amazing.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.409
Well, we could listen
to Grama's old Hollywood stories

21:25.409 --> 21:27.077
all night long, but...

21:28.704 --> 21:30.289
we should probably let you
get some rest.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.999
Nonsense!

21:31.999 --> 21:34.251
I was thinking of putting
some music on.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.795
Perhaps finding out if this
young man knows how to tango.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.464
Mm.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.136
Tracey's probably right.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.679
I got two left feet anyway.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.099
Happy wife, happy life, huh?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.142
Indeed.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.271
Well, I can certainly see that.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.773
I may not be here for the day--

21:55.773 --> 21:57.233
Grams, come on.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.612
But I will rest easy,
knowing she's happy.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.699
-Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.117
-Goodbye, darling.
- Mm.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.911
Okay.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.162
I'll talk to you tomorrow,
Grams, okay?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.539
Okay.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.547
Someone's birthday?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.638
Oh, no.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.645
I didn't think
you were the marrying type.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.105
Carl. Well--

22:36.105 --> 22:38.899
Oh, I can't wait to meet him
at the engagement party.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.192
Engagement party?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.443
-Yeah.
- What?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.237
Who said anything
about an engagement party?

22:43.237 --> 22:45.364
Your grandmother.
Yeah, she called me last night.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.699
Maggie called you?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.200
Yeah. She told me everything.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.120
I just think
it's wonderful, Tracey!

22:51.120 --> 22:53.956
I haven't heard her
that happy in...

22:54.873 --> 22:56.417
...years.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.794
I, for one, think
this is great news.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.797
It's like the whole office
is ecstatic.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.717
Oh. It's exactly
what we all needed.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.386
Just to see Maggie again.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.763
Oh! Oh!

23:09.763 --> 23:11.307
You couldn't have planned it
any better.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.103
Hey, girlfriend.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.354
How come your best friend
is the last person

23:17.354 --> 23:18.856
to hear about all this? Hmm?

23:18.856 --> 23:19.773
Come here.

23:19.773 --> 23:20.816
Who's question mark?

23:20.816 --> 23:21.942
Get in here!

23:23.777 --> 23:25.195
Ouch.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.325
Okay. I'm not engaged.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.367
What?
What are you talking about?

23:30.367 --> 23:31.327
It's all over the office.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.369
I hired a guy.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.454
Okay, what?

23:33.454 --> 23:34.663
No, no. Not like that.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.542
My grandmother is dying.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.710
Don't say that!

23:39.710 --> 23:40.919
It's the truth, Shelley.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.463
I went to go see her last week.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.131
We got on the marriage argument again.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.342
She just about keeled over
right there.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.470
I panicked, and I blurted out
that I'm engaged.

23:49.470 --> 23:50.929
You lied to your grandmother?

23:50.929 --> 23:52.431
I tried to tell you.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.016
And you said all that stuff
about white lies

23:54.016 --> 23:55.225
and good medicine.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.685
Well, that's a little more
grey than white.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.355
Yeah. Well, then she wanted
to meet him.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.899
So, I called
this rent-a-groom place.

24:01.899 --> 24:02.900
Rent a groom?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.902
I'll explain later.
But just...

24:04.902 --> 24:06.779
you can't tell anyone.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.946
Please, Shelley--

24:07.946 --> 24:09.448
Okay, okay. I get it.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.491
Okay, look.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.451
As far as this office
is concerned,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.328
this engagement is real.

24:14.328 --> 24:15.371
All right.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.331
I'll play along
for Maggie's sake.

24:17.331 --> 24:18.749
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.084
So do I.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.961
So, is he cute?

24:22.961 --> 24:25.297
♪ I'm going through changes ♪

24:26.840 --> 24:28.550
♪ It's going faster... ♪

24:28.550 --> 24:29.468
I'm sorry.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.345
I'm sure
this will be the last time.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.847
I just--
I need you there tonight.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.226
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.354
The whole office?

24:40.354 --> 24:42.189
So, we have a full house tonight.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.316
It's just a quick, little thing
at a restaurant.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.526
Ah, Dinner Theatre.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.111
The blue rinse crowd.
Try the buffet. Got it.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.447
I need you
on your best behavior.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.491
No improv, right?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.076
Tax returns all the way.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.704
Okay.

24:56.704 --> 24:59.289
So, tonight, eight o'clock,
Hollingsworth's.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.793
Um, no. No.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.628
So, we... we...
we can't go there.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.838
I used to work there.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.881
It's her favorite place.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.341
Well, someone will recognize me.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.093
It'll blow my cover for sure.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.595
You're that famous, huh?

25:16.473 --> 25:19.143
There's this great little
French bistro, Annabelle's,

25:19.143 --> 25:20.686
over on the East Side.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.188
Tell her
it was our first date place.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.440
She'll love it.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.525
You are creative.
I will give you that.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.444
Just a little improvising.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.533
All right.
I'll make the arrangements.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.785
Just make sure
you pick me up on time.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.121
Haven't missed
a curtain call yet.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.927
You look lovely.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.345
Thank you.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.306
You look lovely, too.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.849
A lovely couple then.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.392
Well, gotta look the part, right?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.858
Like you said,
"Gotta look the part, right?"

26:10.903 --> 26:13.572
It's on loan from a... a good friend.

26:14.865 --> 26:15.657
I get it.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.868
It's a... it's a prop.

26:17.868 --> 26:18.702
Yeah, yeah.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.163
Something like that.
Try it on.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.377
There. Now, we both
have our motivation

26:27.377 --> 26:28.378
for the next scene.

26:37.763 --> 26:38.806
Thank you.

26:48.816 --> 26:49.691
I'm so excited.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.943
Oh, really?

26:50.943 --> 26:51.985
There they are.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.824
You look breathtaking!

26:58.242 --> 26:59.910
She's all yours.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.123
Um, Grams.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.917
Where did this new wardrobe
come from?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.669
This old frock?

27:08.669 --> 27:11.296
I wore it to my last
book signing in New York.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.798
I'm pulling out all the stops.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.383
Maggie, you look heavenly.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.551
Aw.

27:15.551 --> 27:19.054
Speaking of,
this Annabelle gal...

27:19.054 --> 27:20.806
I'm sorry
about the last-minute switch.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.099
Oh, not at all.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.726
I've been going
to Hollingsworth's for years.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.896
And this place,
talk about enchanted.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.857
Wherever did you find it?

27:29.857 --> 27:31.275
Sometimes, you just stumble
upon something,

27:31.275 --> 27:32.860
and you... you fall in love.

27:40.534 --> 27:43.245
Well, if the house sparkling
is any indication,

27:43.245 --> 27:44.371
it's love at first sight.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.047
Such a gentleman.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.886
This is lovely.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.851
Oh, here, let me.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.144
Just two red wines, please.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.147
Uh, thank you.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.149
- Maggie.
- Thank you.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.904
Yes, yes, yes.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.702
Ladies and gentlemen.

28:25.037 --> 28:28.665
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you

28:28.665 --> 28:33.003
my granddaughter Tracey
and her fiancé Rob.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.639
I've written many stories
in my time.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.767
And I've sent many characters
on wile adventures,

28:46.767 --> 28:48.727
looking for love.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.855
But it's often when we stop
searching for something

28:51.855 --> 28:53.774
that we find it.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.525
So, I'd like to propose a toast.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.407
To letting love find you.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.748
- Here.
- Thank you.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.208
I think you could use a drink.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.668
Yeah.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.128
The mystery man at last.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.674
Shelley.
This is my fiancé, Rob.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.509
Rob, this is my best friend, Shelley.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.760
The one with the big mouth.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.887
I've heard all about you.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.723
I didn't know accountants
were so good-looking.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.850
Uh, Shelley, dear.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.185
I don't think
this fine restaurant

29:30.185 --> 29:32.688
wants to be the scene
of a murder tonight.

29:32.688 --> 29:33.647
Oh, my good God!

29:33.647 --> 29:34.523
What?

29:34.523 --> 29:35.941
This ring.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.609
It's enough to make a girl weak
in the knees.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.902
It's just a prop.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.320
It could've fooled me.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.448
Yes. Well, maybe you should go
rest your weak knees.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.200
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.953
Don't worry about me.
I'll keep my mouth shut.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.749
Listen, are you available
the next couple of weeks?

29:52.749 --> 29:55.544
I have this ex-boyfriend
I wanna drive crazy--

29:55.544 --> 29:56.628
Shelley!

29:58.213 --> 30:00.007
Okay.

30:00.007 --> 30:00.924
Hi!

30:00.924 --> 30:01.967
Hey, Shelley.

30:01.967 --> 30:02.884
They invited you.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.011
What was that about?

30:04.011 --> 30:05.470
She knows.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.056
Knows what?

30:08.056 --> 30:10.058
Tracey, you look...

30:10.058 --> 30:11.560
...delicious.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.688
- Okay.
- Todd. This is my fiancé, Rob.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.065
Rob.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.692
Mm.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.238
It is truly an honor
to meet the man

30:23.238 --> 30:25.032
who, uh, melted
the ice queen's heart.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.784
So, seriously, how'd you do it?

30:27.784 --> 30:29.578
No, no. Let me guess.

30:29.578 --> 30:32.664
You're a crown prince,
heir to the throne of Moravia,

30:32.664 --> 30:35.333
and, uh,
gave it all up for love.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.793
No. Afraid not.

30:36.793 --> 30:37.669
Oh, well, I got it.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.921
You are a secret agent,

30:39.921 --> 30:42.424
masquerading
as an international playboy.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.843
You're hiding here until
the heat blows over, and

30:44.843 --> 30:46.136
Tracey here is your cover.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.766
That sounds a lot like the plot
to my third novel, Todd.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.102
You wanna be careful
I don't sue you for plagiarism.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.188
Oh, Maggie.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.607
May I just say on behalf
of the entire

30:58.607 --> 31:01.651
Barmont Publishing family
how truly honored it is

31:01.651 --> 31:04.821
to have you here this evening,
and looking so radiant.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.532
Why, thank you, Todd.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.326
Perhaps I'll have you deliver
my eulogy.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.620
Maggie...

31:12.788 --> 31:14.998
don't even talk like that.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.876
Of course, I'd be honored
to, uh, read at your funeral--

31:17.876 --> 31:19.377
Cool your jets, Todd.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.712
I'll probably screw
everything up,

31:20.712 --> 31:21.838
and outlive all of you.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.801
Oh, Maggie.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.305
Dinner is served.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.848
Yum.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.231
I guess I've always had a thing for numbers.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.817
A passion really.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.694
And most kids hate the idea
that math is all around us.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.906
It's in the portions of food
on your dinner plate.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.993
The number of friends and family
you can sit around the table.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.371
The number of beats per minute
of the heart of a man

31:54.371 --> 31:55.956
madly in love.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.210
Well, there's...
there's a pureness to math.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.671
And a beauty.

32:02.671 --> 32:06.299
You know, a certain completeness
in combination.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.678
The sum is greater
than its parts.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.763
You sure don't talk
like an accountant.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.724
Accountant, right.

32:14.724 --> 32:18.061
I still like
the international playboy angle.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.980
Nope. Numbers guy.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.816
Oh, okay, Mr. Einstein.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.985
Hey, Rob,
what firm did you say

32:24.985 --> 32:26.570
you were working for again?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.280
Robinson & Younger.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.698
Is that right?

32:29.698 --> 32:32.826
You know, I think I know
a couple of guys over there.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.119
What's the manager's name again?

32:34.119 --> 32:35.370
Let's not bore the party with--

32:35.370 --> 32:37.747
Roger. Roger McLaren.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.541
Roger. Right. Right.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.293
So, he would know you.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.836
That's highly unlikely.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.588
They don't let me
out of the cellar very often.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.843
No. To be honest,
I haven't had much of a chance

32:49.843 --> 32:51.595
to mingle since transferring
here from Chicago.

32:51.595 --> 32:52.888
Oh, sure, sure.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.431
Of course, of course.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.725
But you've been doing some
consulting with our company.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.643
Did you know that, Carl?

32:58.643 --> 33:01.021
Oh. I don't really handle
the books.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.439
Oh, yes.

33:02.439 --> 33:05.066
Anyone actually seen this guy?

33:05.066 --> 33:06.318
Of course, Todd.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.153
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.363
I've corresponded with Rob
a couple of times.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.365
I just never made
the romantic connection.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.329
Chicago.
Is that where you're from?

33:17.329 --> 33:19.039
Yes. Born and raised.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.541
I... I grew up
around restaurants actually.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.835
My dad started out as a waiter
at a little French place

33:23.835 --> 33:25.420
just like this.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.547
An engagement party
would break his heart.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.423
Really?

33:28.423 --> 33:29.758
Oh, sure.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.885
He'd say, "There's one less
bachelor come here to eat

33:31.885 --> 33:32.928
every night."

33:34.971 --> 33:37.307
He was a little old-fashioned.

33:37.307 --> 33:38.808
I see.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.603
After my mom died,

33:41.603 --> 33:44.189
he decided to open up
a little place of his own.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.607
He did all right.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.985
But I saw the toll
it took on him.

33:48.985 --> 33:52.572
Being the face of a business,
it's hard on family life.

33:53.782 --> 33:54.991
People don't wanna see
the waiters.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.952
They wanna see you.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.079
He was hoping that he'd hand
the whole thing over to me,

33:59.079 --> 34:01.915
but...
I went a different direction.

34:01.915 --> 34:04.000
Into the exciting world
of numbers.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.420
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

34:09.422 --> 34:12.300
But now, I'm...
I'm ready for a new journey.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.553
I... I don't know
if it was the moonlight,

34:15.553 --> 34:17.722
reflecting off the pool
that lit up her eyes

34:17.722 --> 34:18.764
when I first saw them.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.684
Pool?

34:20.684 --> 34:22.601
I thought you were skiing.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.728
Skiing?

34:24.980 --> 34:27.482
The... the pool came
after the skiing.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.692
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right.

34:28.692 --> 34:29.818
We, um...

34:31.360 --> 34:33.862
I would just like
to thank you all for being here

34:33.862 --> 34:35.614
this evening.

34:35.614 --> 34:38.702
This is as much for my
grandmother as it is for us.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.954
Thank you, both of you.

34:43.373 --> 34:46.042
And with that, I'm afraid
we must bid you all adieu.

34:46.042 --> 34:46.626
Mm.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.085
Okay.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.297
Darling, shall we?

34:50.297 --> 34:51.505
Of course.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.805
-Okay.
- Nice to meet you all.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.057
-Bye.
- And nice to meet you, Robert.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.309
Todd.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.522
What did I say
about improvising?

35:07.522 --> 35:08.898
The pool was a little slip.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.066
A little slip.

35:10.066 --> 35:10.984
I just though we needed

35:10.984 --> 35:12.319
to get back
to the romantic stuff.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.407
Oh, come on.
The crowd was loving it.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.326
Hmm.
I guess it did go over well.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.121
Thank you for the save
on the accounting manager.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.290
I did not have that
in the character profile.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.208
- Hey. I did my research.
- Okay.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.587
- Tracey.
- Todd.

35:30.587 --> 35:31.796
- Numbers guy.
- Hi.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.800
Thanks for coming, Todd.
It was a pleasure.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.885
You could've warned me
about Todd.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.094
I'm sorry.

35:39.429 --> 35:42.349
Such a lovely evening.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.100
So, what have you planned
for the wedding?

35:44.100 --> 35:46.978
I know Claude very well
at the Somerset Tea House.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.438
It's such a romantic place.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.856
- It'd be perfect!
-Mm.

35:49.856 --> 35:52.859
We were thinking of keeping it
a small affair.

35:52.859 --> 35:53.985
Justice of the peace
and a few friends.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.445
Hmm.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.447
I see.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.783
Well, I guess it shouldn't
matter to me anyway.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.787
Well, it wouldn't hurt us
just to look at the place.

36:03.787 --> 36:04.996
Oh, bless you, darling.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.791
I was hoping
that you would say that.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.043
Allan and I can meet you there
tomorrow at noon.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.754
We'd be delighted.

36:12.754 --> 36:13.630
Delighted.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.215
Very well.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.591
Onward, driver.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.635
But, of course, mademoiselle.

36:18.635 --> 36:21.554
I'll see you later!

36:21.554 --> 36:22.806
- Love you.
-Love you, sweetie.

36:25.392 --> 36:26.601
What was that?

36:26.601 --> 36:27.727
This was supposed to be it.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.771
A couple weeks of joy.
That's what you said.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.190
I'm game if you are.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.818
I'll even give you a discount.

36:34.818 --> 36:35.902
A discount.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.948
No skiing or pool stories,
all right?

36:39.948 --> 36:41.199
Yes, dear.

36:41.199 --> 36:45.745
Don't "Yes, dear" me, Rob Jones.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.101
Good morning.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.060
Hi.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.355
Two milk, one sweetener, right?

37:12.355 --> 37:13.481
Yeah.

37:14.691 --> 37:15.525
How did you know that?

37:15.525 --> 37:17.193
Attention to detail.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.780
What are you doing here?

37:20.780 --> 37:22.240
I thought we'd do
a little acting exercise.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.159
- Get in the character.
- A what?

37:24.159 --> 37:25.994
Come on. Get your coat.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.330
Trust me, you'll love it.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.542
Okay.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.549
Can you tell me
where we're going?

37:42.051 --> 37:43.094
Trust me.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.429
Okay.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.146
I had this bit part on this Western TV show

37:53.146 --> 37:54.105
a few years back.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.690
Mm-hmm.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.234
I played this juggler in this traveling group

37:58.234 --> 37:59.903
of performers.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.571
I had two lines.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.031
"The show must go on."

38:03.031 --> 38:05.617
And "Pardon me, ma'am,
but I do believe your cow

38:05.617 --> 38:07.160
just ate
one of my juggling clubs.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.207
I had three minutes
of screen time,

38:12.207 --> 38:14.959
but I took three days,

38:14.959 --> 38:18.838
and I developed
this... this whole backstory

38:18.838 --> 38:20.131
for this juggler.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.966
- Backstory?
- Yeah.

38:21.966 --> 38:25.762
Like, well, how did he end up
with this motley crew?

38:25.762 --> 38:29.182
And did he come
from a long line of jugglers?

38:29.182 --> 38:33.144
Or did he earn a degree
in projectile throwing

38:33.144 --> 38:36.105
from a prestigious
juggling university?

38:36.105 --> 38:39.817
I... I even gave him
this slight Swedish accent.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.697
I figured he grew up juggling pickled herrings.

38:44.697 --> 38:45.865
Oh, wow.

38:48.701 --> 38:51.037
It's called an origin story.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.830
You see, even though
I only had a couple of lines

38:52.830 --> 38:56.543
and a... a few minutes'
screen time,

38:56.543 --> 38:59.212
the backstory made
the character

38:59.212 --> 39:02.924
more... more real, more...
more alive.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.387
Even if you did stink
of herring.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.975
Like, what about us, huh?

39:11.975 --> 39:14.519
What's our origin story?

39:14.519 --> 39:15.728
Oh. I think you rolled that out

39:15.728 --> 39:18.231
with your skiing-slash-
pool party gig.

39:18.231 --> 39:22.277
Yeah. That's how we met,
but who are we?

39:23.987 --> 39:26.447
Tell me about
this Rob Jones guy.

39:26.447 --> 39:30.159
What attracted you to him?

39:30.159 --> 39:33.121
Uh, the usual things.

39:33.121 --> 39:36.749
He's honest, hard working.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.418
Sensible shoes.

39:38.418 --> 39:41.588
Sounds like a real
prince charming.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.174
He, um...

39:46.968 --> 39:49.220
he has a nice smile.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.222
Really?

39:51.222 --> 39:52.432
Mm-hmm.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.685
And, um,

39:55.685 --> 39:58.521
a chihuahua named Louie.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.858
Yes. Now, we're talkin'!

40:04.527 --> 40:07.822
Okay. Well, what about this
Tracey Westmoreland character?

40:07.822 --> 40:09.449
Hmm?

40:09.449 --> 40:10.575
Let's see.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.869
She... she does wear
sensible shoes.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.998
But she's also got
this gorgeous red pair

40:16.998 --> 40:18.082
of patent leather heels

40:18.082 --> 40:19.751
that she wears
for special occasions.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.504
She works as an editor
at a publishing firm,

40:23.504 --> 40:27.634
but she secretly wants to start
a hippie commune in Oregon.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.723
I did spend a lot of time
wandering the wilderness

40:33.723 --> 40:36.142
in my... in my youth.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.693
After my parents died, I, um...

40:47.862 --> 40:49.530
I closed myself off
a little I guess.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.659
My grandmother was great.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.953
I mean...

40:55.953 --> 40:59.749
she just lost her son
and her daughter-in-law, but...

41:01.125 --> 41:02.335
she stepped right in...

41:04.087 --> 41:06.964
with... unconditional love

41:06.964 --> 41:11.010
for a sad and angry
12-year-old girl.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.896
We should... we should probably
get back to port.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.398
Don't wanna be late
for the ball.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.995
Listen, Tracey,
I... I wanted tell you...

41:39.330 --> 41:40.957
when I was telling about my mom
last night, I...

41:42.375 --> 41:45.253
I meant no offense
to your folks.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.547
It's all right, Rob. I know.

41:47.547 --> 41:49.132
Sometimes life is a series of...

41:50.258 --> 41:52.135
half truths.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.970
I know.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.472
Maybe Rob Jones knows
a little bit more about life

41:56.472 --> 41:58.391
than just sensible shoes.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.309
Maybe.

42:00.309 --> 42:03.855
He... he does know
what it's like to be a...

42:05.857 --> 42:09.694
a sad and an angry little kid.

42:12.447 --> 42:13.865
My mom really did die...

42:15.491 --> 42:16.909
when I was nine.

42:26.252 --> 42:27.962
Come on.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.922
I don't wanna leave Maggie
standing at the altar.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.431
Good morning. And welcome to the Somerset Tea House.

42:38.431 --> 42:39.974
Are you here for tea or a tour?

42:39.974 --> 42:42.560
We're meeting someone
for a tour.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.604
Oh. Forgive me.
It's Tracey, isn't it?

42:44.604 --> 42:46.022
Yeah.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.982
Oh, my. Your grandmother. How is she?

42:47.982 --> 42:50.651
Better.
We're meeting her here.

42:50.651 --> 42:53.446
And you're considering
having your ceremony here?

42:54.697 --> 42:55.740
Wonderful!

42:55.740 --> 42:57.158
It's just a tour.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.242
Well...

42:59.285 --> 43:01.496
...may I be so bold
as to confess

43:01.496 --> 43:04.207
that your love for one another
simply radiates

43:04.207 --> 43:05.208
from your very beings?

43:07.668 --> 43:09.670
It's that obvious, huh?

43:09.670 --> 43:11.923
- Good morning, lovers!
- Good morning, lovers!

43:11.923 --> 43:13.591
Maggie.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.468
My little dance routine last night reminded me

43:15.468 --> 43:17.178
I still need my wheels
now and then.

43:17.178 --> 43:18.304
- Mm.
-Mm.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.388
Hello, Claude.

43:19.388 --> 43:21.057
Oh, Mrs. Westmoreland.

43:21.057 --> 43:23.726
May I say what an honor it is
for us to host you.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.311
This will be an event
to remember.

43:25.311 --> 43:26.145
It's just a tour.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.438
Wonderful!

43:27.438 --> 43:28.981
Feel free to make yourselves
at home.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.775
Roam the grounds
at your leisure.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.486
We can't wait to help you
celebrate your magical day!

43:33.486 --> 43:34.862
Well, we're just heading up
for another service

43:34.862 --> 43:36.447
this afternoon.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.199
I will be in the event room
if you have any questions.

43:41.828 --> 43:45.164
Right.
Let's go out into the sunshine.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.374
Onward, driver.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.584
But, of course, mademoiselle.

43:51.504 --> 43:53.172
Wonderful.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.803
It's beautiful. Simply beautiful.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.137
It certainly is.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.808
Would you two kids mind doing me a favor?

44:03.808 --> 44:05.017
What's that, Grams?

44:05.017 --> 44:07.228
Could you just stand over there?

44:07.228 --> 44:09.188
You know, so I could just take
a picture.

44:09.188 --> 44:10.106
Grama, really?

44:10.106 --> 44:12.567
Maggie, we'd be delighted.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.992
Stop it.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.577
Well, here we at.

44:22.577 --> 44:23.995
-It's Chad.
- It really is quite magical.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.455
Yeah, wish I could do
a disappearing trick right now.

44:26.455 --> 44:27.039
Smile.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.624
Mm.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.130
Oh, my God. It is him.

44:35.464 --> 44:38.426
I'm so embarrassed.

44:38.426 --> 44:39.385
-Oh.
- But I just had to meet you.

44:40.636 --> 44:41.929
Are you coming back
for a second season?

44:41.929 --> 44:43.222
Second season of what?

44:43.222 --> 44:45.141
Sinners of the City.

44:45.141 --> 44:46.893
Chad the mechanic!

44:46.893 --> 44:48.060
Ladies, I'm sorry.

44:48.060 --> 44:48.686
I'm not... I'm not
who you think I am.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.187
You were so sexy.

44:50.187 --> 44:50.980
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

44:50.980 --> 44:51.522
I'm not who you think I am.

44:55.943 --> 44:56.777
Ladies, ladies.

44:56.777 --> 44:57.695
You were so...

45:04.994 --> 45:06.746
Ladies, please. Please.

45:16.005 --> 45:18.049
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.220
Sinners of the City?

45:23.220 --> 45:24.639
It was a bit part.

45:24.639 --> 45:26.474
A terrible show
a couple years back.

45:26.474 --> 45:27.850
I totally forgot about it.

45:27.850 --> 45:30.519
Well, let's hope we don't run
into anymore "Chad" fans.

45:34.607 --> 45:35.816
Oh, my goodness.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.486
Look at this chair.
This is incredible.

45:38.486 --> 45:39.695
Hello. May I?

45:39.695 --> 45:40.446
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:40.446 --> 45:41.238
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

45:41.238 --> 45:43.199
- I got it!
- I got it.

45:43.199 --> 45:45.534
- Oh, you got it.
- Thank you.

45:45.534 --> 45:47.244
Oh, and it goes backwards,
are you kidding me?

45:47.244 --> 45:48.496
Careful.

45:48.496 --> 45:49.872
Let's really take this for a spin.

45:49.872 --> 45:51.499
Let's get the cars.

45:51.499 --> 45:53.334
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

45:55.252 --> 45:57.338
It's okay. Let's go. He does this every day.

45:57.338 --> 45:58.422
What?

45:58.422 --> 45:59.507
Yeah. He, like, volunteers.

45:59.507 --> 46:03.302
And this I believe
is your stop, my lady?

46:08.057 --> 46:09.308
Let's get in the car.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.893
-So comfortable.
-Okay.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.436
-Ooh!
- Slowly.

46:12.436 --> 46:13.646
Oh.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.733
-Ah, yeah.
-Uh-huh.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.360
Uh-huh.

46:20.945 --> 46:24.991
Well, all right, sweetie.
I'll call you.

46:24.991 --> 46:27.034
I'd like to have you both
over for dinner again soon.

46:27.034 --> 46:29.453
Maximize my time with you.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.579
Sounds good, Grams.

46:30.579 --> 46:34.083
Feet in.
Take care, Tracey.

46:34.667 --> 46:35.876
And, Rob.

46:40.089 --> 46:42.049
I kinda wanna call you Chad now.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.970
Chad!

46:45.970 --> 46:48.472
You can't-- get outta here.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.016
I totally forgot about that.

46:50.016 --> 46:51.642
It wasn't supposed to come out
till next week.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.102
So, you model as well?

46:53.102 --> 46:55.104
Oh. Thank God they haven't seen
the commercial.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.440
An ad campaign and a commercial!

46:57.440 --> 46:59.358
Are they spinning this
into a mini-series as well?

47:01.402 --> 47:03.154
Do you have any sunglasses?

47:03.154 --> 47:04.447
What for?

47:04.447 --> 47:05.740
To hide your face?

47:05.740 --> 47:08.617
Look, I'm a working actor.
What am I supposed to do?

47:08.617 --> 47:11.787
I'm not responsible for reruns
and ad campaigns.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.831
I just don't like surprises.

47:13.831 --> 47:14.874
Well, it's been a while

47:14.874 --> 47:16.333
since I've to submit a resumé
for a job,

47:16.333 --> 47:17.877
but I can assure you
it's a rambling list

47:17.877 --> 47:21.297
of corny commercials
and cop number two guys.

47:21.297 --> 47:23.799
I can't help it
if Chad the mechanic pops up

47:23.799 --> 47:25.009
every once in a while.

47:35.227 --> 47:36.771
Lisen, um...

47:38.314 --> 47:41.025
I really do appreciate
everything you're doing

47:41.025 --> 47:42.693
for my grandmother.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.028
I know this must be tough
for you.

47:45.446 --> 47:46.989
But if you need me,
I'll be there...

47:48.240 --> 47:49.992
for both of you.

47:59.210 --> 48:02.379
Hold onto it... for now.

48:06.467 --> 48:07.718
Thanks, Rob.

48:26.403 --> 48:27.947
Hey! There's little miss fix it.

48:27.947 --> 48:29.782
Hello, Todd.
How was your hangover?

48:29.782 --> 48:30.908
It was great. Thank you for asking.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.701
How was the weekend
with the crown prince?

48:32.701 --> 48:34.120
He's an accountant.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.454
Oh, right! I'm sorry I keep forgetting.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.540
You know what's weird
is I actually phoned over

48:37.540 --> 48:38.791
to Robinson & Younger,

48:38.791 --> 48:41.168
and they've never heard
of a Rob Jones.

48:46.507 --> 48:48.717
I'm sure if someone were to call
Barmont Publishing

48:48.717 --> 48:50.761
and ask for a Todd Pearlman,

48:50.761 --> 48:52.096
they might get
a similar response.

48:53.222 --> 48:54.723
That's not true.

48:54.723 --> 48:56.600
Look, maybe I don't wanna see
you get hurt, okay?

48:56.600 --> 48:59.812
I think you're makin'
a big mistake.

48:59.812 --> 49:02.148
Okay. He's an accountant
you like numbers, okay?

49:02.148 --> 49:04.483
I get it.
But I know numbers, you know?

49:04.483 --> 49:07.153
I-- what number am I thinking
about right now?

49:07.153 --> 49:08.779
One.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.823
Lucky guess.
See, we're succinct. We're--

49:10.823 --> 49:13.117
Todd.
This has been super fun.

49:14.952 --> 49:18.247
Tracey, I can give you numbers.

49:18.247 --> 49:18.873
Trace?

49:20.833 --> 49:22.751
Shelley, did you miss me?

49:38.684 --> 49:40.895
Got some beaters
for our in-house grease monkey.

49:42.313 --> 49:45.608
Hello, Miss Miracle Worker!

49:45.608 --> 49:48.402
Got some clunkers,
and they're out of gas.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.112
He was telling the truth.

49:50.112 --> 49:50.863
Come again.

49:50.863 --> 49:52.364
Rob.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.783
He was telling the truth
about his upbringing in Chicago.

49:54.783 --> 49:55.743
Oh, yeah?

50:00.164 --> 50:03.167
Wow. He is prolific.

50:03.167 --> 50:05.878
Is Chad the mechanic on there?

50:05.878 --> 50:07.421
I don't know.
But look at this.

50:07.421 --> 50:08.881
Look at his bio.

50:08.881 --> 50:10.466
Born in Chicago.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.635
Mom died when he was very young.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.970
Raised by his father,
and like most aspiring actors,

50:14.970 --> 50:16.305
he waited tables.

50:16.305 --> 50:18.265
Mm-hmm.

50:18.265 --> 50:19.433
He was telling the truth.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.028
What?

50:32.196 --> 50:34.365
You're falling for this guy.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.158
What? No, of course, not.

50:36.158 --> 50:37.660
No.

50:37.660 --> 50:38.994
Yes, you are.

50:38.994 --> 50:40.621
I've never seen you look
at a real guy like that,

50:40.621 --> 50:42.665
let alone a picture of one.

50:42.665 --> 50:43.791
Don't be ridiculous.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.919
I'll admit he's... he's cute.

50:48.337 --> 50:50.839
He definitely looks the part.
I'll give him that.

50:50.839 --> 50:53.801
He's an actor after all.

50:53.801 --> 50:54.927
So?

50:56.345 --> 50:58.847
I'm just saying,
you can't believe everything

50:58.847 --> 51:01.517
you read on the web,
especially on an actor's bio.

51:01.517 --> 51:04.687
He's actually very sweet, too.

51:04.687 --> 51:07.147
True. He's a real Romeo.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.441
And you make a great Juliet.

51:09.441 --> 51:10.609
Stop.

51:10.609 --> 51:15.239
O Romeo, Romeo.
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

51:15.239 --> 51:18.784
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

51:18.784 --> 51:21.161
Not a lot of people know
the next line of that speech.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.579
Classically trained.

51:22.579 --> 51:24.665
Sorry,
I was in the neighborhood.

51:24.665 --> 51:26.959
Can I take you for lunch?

51:26.959 --> 51:28.502
I wanna ask you something.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.218
That's up to her!

51:36.218 --> 51:37.678
I could eat, but whatever.

51:37.678 --> 51:39.596
Okay, bye-bye.

51:39.596 --> 51:43.350
Yeah, yeah.
I... I would love to eat.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.269
I'll just get my bag.

51:54.445 --> 51:55.821
Can I ask you something?

51:55.821 --> 51:57.614
Shoot.

51:57.614 --> 51:58.907
Are you really from Chicago?

52:00.034 --> 52:01.910
I am.

52:01.910 --> 52:03.287
So, the other night
at the party

52:03.287 --> 52:05.581
when you were talking
about your past,

52:05.581 --> 52:09.251
your mom and dad...
were you telling the truth?

52:09.251 --> 52:10.169
I was.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.339
I just figured
it was easier that way.

52:15.049 --> 52:16.467
I realized I might have been
going off script, but it just...

52:17.885 --> 52:19.595
it felt right.

52:19.595 --> 52:22.014
Honestly, it was... it was nice.

52:23.515 --> 52:25.601
See, sometimes,
acting's all about improvising.

52:27.019 --> 52:28.896
If things change, then you...
you roll with it.

52:28.896 --> 52:29.980
Mm.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.565
And if your partner
has a great idea,

52:31.565 --> 52:32.441
you go with it.

52:32.441 --> 52:35.736
It's called... chemistry.

52:35.736 --> 52:37.029
Hmm.

52:37.029 --> 52:40.699
Like Laurel and Hardy,
or Newman and Redford.

52:41.575 --> 52:44.036
Bogey and Bacall.

52:44.953 --> 52:46.080
Exactly.

52:47.748 --> 52:48.874
So, what did you...

52:48.874 --> 52:50.751
what did you wanna ask me?

52:50.751 --> 52:52.461
I just wanted float
something past you.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.383
I mean, you have this knack
for problem-solving.

52:57.383 --> 52:58.801
Mm-hmm.

52:58.801 --> 52:59.927
They don't call me
the fix-it gal for nothing.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.431
Even if it's crazy,
and it doesn't make any sense?

53:04.431 --> 53:06.100
But when you think about it,
it kinda does?

53:06.100 --> 53:08.936
Yeah. I mean,
life is crazy, right?

53:08.936 --> 53:12.231
A lot of things in life don't,
I mean, make sense.

53:12.231 --> 53:14.566
Okay. Here goes.

53:16.610 --> 53:17.945
I'm going to be a dad...

53:19.655 --> 53:21.240
I hope.

53:21.240 --> 53:22.574
What?

53:22.574 --> 53:25.077
In a streaming series. A part.

53:25.077 --> 53:26.036
Oh!

53:26.036 --> 53:27.204
My agent just called.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.123
They wanna see an audition tape.

53:29.123 --> 53:31.959
It's a tiny part,
but it's recurring...

53:31.959 --> 53:33.085
if I get it.

53:33.085 --> 53:35.254
A part. Yeah.

53:35.254 --> 53:37.798
Hey. But they shoot
the pilot here.

53:37.798 --> 53:38.757
Oh, really?

53:38.757 --> 53:40.050
Yeah.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.428
Then it's just back to LA.
I just don't know

53:42.428 --> 53:44.930
whether I should send
the tape in or not.

53:44.930 --> 53:46.390
I'm done with rejection,
you know?

53:46.390 --> 53:47.891
Mm. Mm-hmm.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.685
But it's not a mechanic.

53:51.687 --> 53:53.105
It's a cop show.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.108
Would you read it?

53:57.401 --> 53:58.527
You know, as an editor,

53:58.527 --> 54:00.821
you could tell me
what you think of this guy.

54:00.821 --> 54:03.615
You know, how I should approach
this character.

54:03.615 --> 54:05.284
- Sure.
- Really?

54:06.702 --> 54:08.162
Because I was thinking
of packing

54:08.162 --> 54:10.372
this whole acting thing,
and, you know,

54:10.372 --> 54:12.541
maybe become a real accountant.

54:12.541 --> 54:14.668
No, Rob. If...

54:14.668 --> 54:18.881
if the part's good,
I'm... I'm happy for you.

54:18.881 --> 54:20.299
I know you'd understand.

54:22.551 --> 54:24.636
You know, Joe Pesci
was going to quit acting

54:24.636 --> 54:26.388
right before he got Raging Bull?

54:26.388 --> 54:28.265
- Really?
-Hmm.

54:28.265 --> 54:29.808
Didn't know that before.

54:29.808 --> 54:32.394
Maybe I could stop by
your office this afternoon

54:32.394 --> 54:33.437
with... with the script.

54:34.688 --> 54:36.064
Yeah. Sure.

54:43.822 --> 54:47.284
Tracey, Tracey, Tracey. Tracey.

54:48.535 --> 54:50.245
Do you ever work?

54:50.245 --> 54:51.455
Oh, I've been working.

54:51.455 --> 54:53.582
Fact-checking on your boyfriend.

54:53.582 --> 54:54.875
He's not my boyfriend.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.376
Pull up his bio.

54:59.713 --> 55:00.923
There, look.

55:02.841 --> 55:03.842
Oh, wait.

55:05.385 --> 55:06.512
Look.

55:08.347 --> 55:09.973
What?

55:09.973 --> 55:12.017
Remember what he said
about his dad?

55:12.017 --> 55:13.685
He was a waiter
in a French restaurant,

55:13.685 --> 55:15.979
and he opened up
a little place of his own.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.064
He did all right.

55:18.982 --> 55:21.735
His father
is Arthur Hollingsworth.

55:21.735 --> 55:23.654
Founder and CEO of the chain

55:23.654 --> 55:25.656
of Hollingsworth's
fine-dining restaurants.

55:26.823 --> 55:29.493
Okay. So?

55:29.493 --> 55:31.745
So? It means he's loaded.

55:31.745 --> 55:33.830
Why would he lie about that?

55:33.830 --> 55:35.582
It's not exactly a lie.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.085
More of an act.

55:39.253 --> 55:42.005
Hi, my name's Rob.

55:42.005 --> 55:44.383
I'm not a real serial killer,
but I play one on TV.

55:44.383 --> 55:45.342
- Boo!
- Ah!

55:46.969 --> 55:48.804
I'm so sorry.

55:48.804 --> 55:50.514
Hello, Shelley. Oh.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.933
We have to stop meeting
like this.

55:52.933 --> 55:54.393
Robert Jones, hello.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.146
- Back to my fact-checking.
-Mm.

56:02.568 --> 56:03.527
You up for a read?

56:05.445 --> 56:07.948
So, I thought we could run some lines even

56:07.948 --> 56:10.576
if you don't mind playing
a gum-smacking waitress.

56:10.576 --> 56:12.869
I'm the hitman
who knocked you up.

56:12.869 --> 56:14.538
But I'm trying to go straight.

56:16.915 --> 56:19.042
Can I ask you
something personal?

56:19.042 --> 56:20.460
Who's improvising now?

56:23.088 --> 56:25.882
Tell me about that restaurant
that your dad opened.

56:30.095 --> 56:31.722
My dad?

56:31.722 --> 56:35.851
Yeah. I saw the photo buried in your bio page.

56:37.019 --> 56:40.147
You and your dad,
it was a recent picture.

56:40.147 --> 56:42.232
You know you pay an agent
to update those things.

56:43.734 --> 56:45.277
Is your dad
Arthur Hollingsworth?

56:46.653 --> 56:47.863
Yes.

56:49.072 --> 56:50.657
And why does that matter?

56:50.657 --> 56:53.535
Because my dad
is Arthur Hollingsworth.

56:53.535 --> 56:55.203
Imagine being the son
of one of the most successful

56:55.203 --> 56:57.289
restaurateurs in the country.

56:57.289 --> 56:59.207
Then imagine saying "No"
to that fortune

56:59.207 --> 57:01.001
when it was offered to you.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.837
Sounds a lot like being
the granddaughter

57:03.837 --> 57:06.006
of one of the greatest
romance novelists

57:06.006 --> 57:07.257
of the 20th century.

57:08.675 --> 57:09.801
Exactly.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.930
I spent most of my life
in that shadow,

57:13.930 --> 57:16.391
and it was awfully cold there.

57:17.976 --> 57:20.729
So, I decided to step out
into the light

57:20.729 --> 57:24.358
and just happened to be
in the light of the stage,

57:26.193 --> 57:29.696
Well, a prominent name
could have opened doors for you.

57:29.696 --> 57:30.739
If I'm gonna make it,

57:30.739 --> 57:31.573
I wanted it to be
because I earned it.

57:31.573 --> 57:33.617
Not because who my father is.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.661
There's no shame in that.

57:40.624 --> 57:42.626
Oh, it's Maggie. Hello.

57:42.626 --> 57:44.294
-Hey, hon. Got a minute?
- Yes.

57:44.294 --> 57:45.379
What are you doing?

57:45.379 --> 57:47.381
Actually,
we're just having a drink.

57:47.381 --> 57:48.423
Is everything okay?

57:48.423 --> 57:49.883
Yes. Can I see you?

57:49.883 --> 57:51.093
-Sure.
-Tomorrow.

57:51.093 --> 57:53.470
Tomorrow? Yeah, I'll be there.

57:53.470 --> 57:54.429
Say "Hi" to Rob.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.264
Yes. I'll tell him
you say "Hello."

57:56.264 --> 57:57.849
Okay, bye, hon.

57:57.849 --> 57:59.142
Okay, bye.

58:01.061 --> 58:03.230
Maggie is coming
to the office tomorrow.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.690
A big announcement.

58:06.358 --> 58:07.734
Thanks for hearing me out.

58:09.403 --> 58:10.946
Thanks for being honest.

58:19.579 --> 58:22.040
I'm afraid I've done something crazy.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.250
What are you talking about?

58:23.250 --> 58:25.419
Completely selfish, I know.

58:25.419 --> 58:26.837
What's going on?

58:26.837 --> 58:29.047
I spoke with Claude.

58:29.047 --> 58:31.508
Went by a few days ago
to pay for the attack

58:31.508 --> 58:33.385
of the Chad fans in the gazebo.

58:33.385 --> 58:35.804
- Okay.
- And something struck me.

58:35.804 --> 58:38.098
Just felt right.

58:38.098 --> 58:39.599
Grama, what have you done?

58:39.599 --> 58:42.394
I booked a wedding rehearsal
for you and Rob.

58:45.147 --> 58:47.065
A dress rehearsal really.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.860
You're kidding.

58:49.860 --> 58:52.654
Maggie!
What a pleasant surprise.

58:52.654 --> 58:53.864
What's going on?

58:53.864 --> 58:56.074
They're having
a wedding dress rehearsal.

58:56.074 --> 58:57.993
- Wait--
- That's wonderful!

58:57.993 --> 58:59.119
What's so wonderful?

58:59.119 --> 59:00.537
Oh. Uh, Tracey and Rob

59:00.537 --> 59:02.289
are having a wedding dress rehearsal.

59:02.289 --> 59:04.624
Oh, yippee!

59:08.462 --> 59:11.965
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I should have spoken to you.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.926
I know you both want
a small ceremony.

59:14.926 --> 59:17.387
And you can still have it.

59:17.387 --> 59:20.056
This way,
no matter what happens,

59:20.056 --> 59:23.143
I can say I was there with you.

59:23.143 --> 59:24.603
Oh, Grama.

59:32.903 --> 59:35.781
I'm just asking
for this one thing.

59:35.781 --> 59:39.326
The rest is up to you,
I promise.

59:39.326 --> 59:40.410
Okay, Grama.

59:45.582 --> 59:47.751
And you're all invited.

59:47.751 --> 59:50.462
This Saturday
at the Somerset Tea House.

59:50.462 --> 59:52.631
And I want you all
in your Sunday best.

59:56.802 --> 59:59.221
Whoo!

59:59.221 --> 01:00:01.973
You know, this is just like the surprise marriage

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:03.725
in the fifth Cassandra novel.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:07.187
Remember, where she falls
for the Swedish prince!

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.271
- Yeah.
- Oh!

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.898
It's a regular, old fairy-tale.

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.274
Mm-hmm.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.533
We don't have to do this, Tray.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.701
It's my grandmother's
dying wish, Shelley.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.918
Sure. One last show then.

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.294
Maybe.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.587
Maybe?

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.339
What if it's not a show?

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:35.257
What do you mean?

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:39.845
Rob wants to meet
to discuss some big news.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:47.102
So, you have fallen in love
with this guy.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:48.228
I don't know.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:51.064
Maybe I have.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:03.243
I guess she likes insurance ads.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:06.329
Actually, it's the series,
I guess, Sinners of the City.

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.540
It's been streaming nonstop online.

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:11.960
Oh, that reminds me.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.296
I have not had a chance
to read Walk the Talk.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:15.755
But I think you would make

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:18.925
a wonderful hitman-slash-
long-distance daddy.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.427
- Thank you.
- Yep.

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:21.887
Though as a working mom,

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:23.763
I would not consider that
a stable job for a child.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:26.933
Well, that's kinda what
I wanna talk to you about.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.479
What kind of a career can an
actor carve out in this city,

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:33.273
you know, without going to LA?

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:34.733
It's very tough.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.776
Which leads me
to my big announcement.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:37.861
I think she brought friends.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.070
- Run!
- Ooh!

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.948
I love you, Chad!
We love you!

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.369
My agent told me

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.829
there's even an online petition

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:49.122
to bring Chad back.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:49.915
No.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:51.291
Although,

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:54.878
I did die in a horrible
dishwasher accident.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:56.171
Wow!

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:58.506
I think we may have lost them.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.175
- Okay.
- Here. Come on here.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.426
I wanna tell you something.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.976
Oh. Speaking of jobs,

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:12.187
my grandmother has one more
favor to ask of you.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.605
- Hmm.
- She's booked a

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:16.691
dress rehearsal for the wedding.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.486
A dress rehearsal? But I thought
we were having a small ceremony.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:22.656
I mean, Rob and Tracey Jones,
that is.

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:26.493
Hmm. We are.
And that's the story.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:29.245
It's kind of a--
like a wedding gift, I guess.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:31.456
It's more for her really.

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.625
And, hey, if you're gonna have a wedding,

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.669
why not have the greatest
living romance novelist

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:36.461
planning it for you?

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.214
Well, that's exciting.

01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:40.507
Mm-hmm.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.509
But I think I have you beat.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:43.551
Really?

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.388
I'm not gonna be a dad anymore.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.015
Oh!

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.308
Broke up with the waitress
already, huh?

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:53.103
The pilot, it got picked up,

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.562
and they want me for the lead.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:55.939
Rob! What?

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:59.317
I have a wardrobe fitting
on Saturday.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.402
We shoot here
for a couple weeks,

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:01.361
and then it's off to LA.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.738
Oh, my goodness!

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:05.657
Wow! That's...

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.243
that's incredible.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.830
But the dress rehearsal's
on Saturday.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.293
Well, maybe we can postpone it.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.795
Maggie's already paid
for everything.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.756
But... but this is it.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:25.218
This is my Joe Pesci moment.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.469
Mm.

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:32.434
No, wait. Wait, Tracey.
I'm sure we can work it out.

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:35.729
Don't worry about it, Rob.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.147
I'll figure something out.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.481
No, listen, Tracey.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.152
I'll call my agent.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:45.947
We'll postpone
the wardrobe fitting.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.324
I'll be there.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.580
I guess that means you'll be

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.331
relocating to LA now, right?

01:03:56.624 --> 01:04:00.170
Well, I have to for the show.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.466
But Saturday,
I'll... I'll be there.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:05.925
I... I promise.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.638
One last performance, right?

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:35.872
Hi.

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:51.679
I feel like such a fool.

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:54.057
I mean, rent a groom.

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.143
The name says it all.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:02.982
He plays the romantic lead
in a lot of girls' fantasies.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:07.237
I mean, I hired him
to play that part.

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:19.415
It was fun... playing a couple.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:23.169
I just thought it...

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:25.922
might become something more.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:29.509
You got caught up in the show.

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:30.593
I don't blame you.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.470
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.514
Well...

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.977
we just have to get
through one last performance,

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:41.646
and I can write him back
out of my life.

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.037
Hello, Rob.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.457
Dad.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:05.086
Been a long time.

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:06.671
There years this May.

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:11.801
You all right?

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.345
Yeah. Actually, I'm really good.

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:17.807
You had dinner?

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.142
I'm not staying long.

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:21.728
Drink then.

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:24.105
Sure.

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.197
Thank you for coming. Take care.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.166
So, what are you drinkin'?

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.751
Club soda's just fine for me.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.169
Two club sodas, please.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.879
Of course.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:50.215
Listen, I didn't come here
to fight.

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:52.050
I came here because I wanted
to tell you two things.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:54.385
Okay.

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:56.512
First...

01:06:58.139 --> 01:06:59.224
I'm an actor.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.353
I know.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:04.771
I've seen
the insurance commercial.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:08.524
No, no, no. Not that stuff.
A real actor. I got a part.

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:12.153
A lead part in a series.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.197
It's a great part.

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.492
It's what I've been working
for my whole life.

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:22.664
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:25.750
Here's your drinks.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:29.921
You are?

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:32.090
Of course!

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:35.426
All I've ever asked from you
is you work hard

01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:37.262
for whatever it is you want.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.429
For me, it's this place,
you know?

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:41.015
I was hoping the

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.226
dream could be shared.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.560
Turned into more of a wedge.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.605
I mean, I guess you had a right
to push me away.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:49.440
- I didn't push you away.
-Oh.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.733
Three years
of the silent treatment

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.110
is not exactly a gentle nudge.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:53.611
I said I didn't come here
to argue.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.365
Well... why are you here?

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.246
I wanted to talk to you
about the ring.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.872
- The ring?
- Yes.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:07.417
Mom's ring.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:12.797
Mom's ring.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:16.843
I've met someone, Dad.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.682
Mom's ring.
So, it's serious?

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:23.683
Yes.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:27.478
I'm in love.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:32.859
That look on my face
when I met your mom.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:37.738
You are so much like her.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.282
You follow your heart.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:43.493
Oh, she would be so proud
of you right now.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.538
I miss her.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.167
I miss her, too.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:56.256
Just make sure
you keep following your heart.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:59.510
It led you through these doors.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:04.807
Looks like it led you
into someone else's heart.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:10.813
So, when do I get to meet her?

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.314
Well, if all goes well,

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.734
I'll need a table for two
for Saturday night.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.411
Whoo!

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.124
Are you trying to set
a world record?

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:31.792
I'm invincible.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:33.127
You say that now.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.671
Hi. My name's Trevor.

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.591
Turn that up.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.176
I was once just like you, not sure which insurance plan

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.676
was right for me and my family.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:45.973
But now that
I'm with Stanfield Insurance,

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:48.350
we all sleep better at night.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.810
Because in life,
you just never know

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.229
when to expect the unexpected.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.693
Stanfield Insurance. We expect the unexpected.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:10:01.656
Do you know that guy?
I know him, too.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:03.533
Only his name ain't Trevor.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.369
It's Brad.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:07.662
See, a while back,

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:09.205
I was trying to get back
with my ex-girlfriend.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.581
And then this guy shows up,

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:14.669
and she says
he's her fiancé. Only...

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:16.629
yeah, he wasn't.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:19.549
Turns out, she hired this guy
to act like her fiancé.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:22.885
They call it Rent-a-Groom.
You call them,

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.387
and then they show up
and ruin your life.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.764
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:35.148
There!
Oh, I got you. I got you.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.860
Oh, you're going down.
You're going down!

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.571
Okay.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:46.242
Hey.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:47.410
Hey.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.411
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.456
What's the matter?

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:53.040
You worried about the wedding
rehearsal tomorrow?

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.918
Oh, no. Everything's perfect.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.837
Dress was bought,
flowers are ordered.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.297
My groom is leaving for LA.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:00.465
Yeah, no.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:02.300
Everything's going
according to plan.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.301
Whoa.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.137
You want him to stay?

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.099
I want him to want to stay.

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.771
So, you're upset because you
fell in love with him?

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.439
I fell in love with him
by mistake.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:17.482
And that's his fault?

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:22.153
Well, now's your chance
to blast him with the truth.

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:23.154
He's in the boardroom
waiting for you.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.364
Rob's here?

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.908
Yes.

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:28.951
Tell him, Tracey.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.578
Well, what if it doesn't change
anything?

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.163
Well, what if it does?

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:34.916
It's called Rent-a-Groom.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:36.250
Rent-a-Groom?

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:37.877
You aren't a gigolo, are you?

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:40.838
Dad, no. It's not like that.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:44.008
People-- well, women pay me
to pretend

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.593
to be their love interests.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.512
But you say you quit.

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:48.804
This morning.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.932
How long were you doing this?

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:54.644
Three years.
Three very long years.

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.189
I think I've been engaged
maybe 20 times.

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:00.107
And I've had some doozies.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.569
But it's finally over.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:06.072
This endless acting.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:09.951
You know how hard it is
to fake being madly in love?

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:12.745
I mean, I'm a good actor, but,

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.455
whoo.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.874
And then
there's engagement party.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:20.503
And all her little friends.
I tell you, it's agony.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.588
It's just this part I'm playing.

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:25.633
It doesn't mean anything.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:28.219
And I'm tired of pretending
that it does.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.433
I can't wait to tell her.

01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:38.980
I'm ready for the real thing.

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:43.818
Well, son, I think you definitely made

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:45.778
the right decision.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:46.821
Thanks, Dad.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.699
And thanks for calling.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:50.616
Bye, son.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:02.753
Tracey, hey. I waited at the office.

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:04.714
Connie said you had to step out
to take a--

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.929
Tracey, please call me.

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.015
I'd really love to talk about--

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:21.480
Hey, Tracey. It's Rob again.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.609
Um, I'm not sure
if I did something to upset you.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:27.486
But, uh, if we could meet--

01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:46.756
Good afternoon, folks.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:50.468
And, Maggie, you look
absolutely gorgeous.

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:52.553
Thank you, Rob. You don't look
so bad yourself.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.680
Oh, well, it is a special day.

01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:58.517
Have you seen Tracey?

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:00.186
Oh, no. Rob, it's...

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:02.271
bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.814
I don't think

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:06.150
a dress rehearsal wedding
counts, sweetheart.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.360
She's inside.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.736
Thank you, Maggie.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:12.448
Well, we'll see you all
after the big moment. Oh.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.200
Everything is perfect.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.369
I couldn't have written
this better myself.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.413
Good luck.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.129
Hey. You're not supposed
to be here.

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.506
I'm sorry, I know.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:29.548
Give me that.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.679
You look absolutely stunning.

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.807
Just getting in the costume.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.725
I half expected you
to send a stand-in.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.268
No. I said I'd be here,
didn't I?

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:42.853
Five minutes to curtain.

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:45.231
Can I talk to you
about something?

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:47.983
There you go.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:50.152
Getting off script again.

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.238
No improvising, remember?

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:53.739
Or are you directing
this show as well?

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.742
Places, everyone.
We can't keep Maggie waiting.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.744
Well, can we talk after?

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.454
Just hit your mark,
and say your lines.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:02.164
We can wrap this whole thing up.

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:48.377
Oh, my goodness.

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:51.756
I am excited...

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:54.675
...and nervous.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.386
This is not my real job,
you understand?

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:01.515
But I have always wanted
to do this.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:04.101
And when Margaret Westmoreland
asked me to preside, well--

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:05.478
Shh!

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:09.106
Hi, darling.

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:32.463
- Excited?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:35.007
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:37.676
to witness the union
of Robert Jones

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:38.803
and Tracey Westmoreland.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:43.057
Marriage is a sacred bond.

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:47.186
A commitment to one another,
born from the seed of destiny,

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.522
nurtured with true love,

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:54.819
to blossom into the flower
of matrimony.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.781
Before we proceed,
I must ask you both

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.991
if there is any impediment
to this union.

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.952
Actually, there is something
I'd like to say.

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:06.205
- Tracey-
- I object!

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:13.921
I object,
because this man is an actor.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.676
Oh, my God. It's true.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.261
I'm not really
a justice of the peace.

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.429
Not you, idiot. Him!

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.139
- Todd!
- His real name is

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:25.975
Robert J. Hollingsworth.

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.602
He works for an outfit
called Rent-a-Groom.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:31.230
Tracey, what's he on about?

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.899
Tracey hired this guy
to fool Maggie.

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:35.359
Tracey, is this true?

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:38.737
Yes. It's true.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:41.490
Grams, I'm so sorry.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.076
I never meant for it
to go this far,

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:45.160
but now that it has,

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:47.955
I'm glad
this little charade is over.

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:51.250
Charade? Is that all
this had been to you?

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:52.209
Yeah, Rob.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.045
It was just a part I'm playing.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:57.715
It doesn't mean anything.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:01.343
I'm tired of pretending
that it does.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.137
- Hey, Tracey. Wait, wait--
-No, no, no. No, no.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:04.430
Wait, please.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.308
Tray.

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:15.941
Maggie, I am so, so truly sorry.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:19.111
No, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:21.405
The ring
that is on Tracey's hand...

01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:25.492
it belonged to my mother.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.412
I was gonna give it to Tracey
for real this time.

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:32.374
But I can see now
that that's not what she wants.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.542
These last few days
have been filled

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.960
with a few half-truths,

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.923
but there is one thing
that is... very real.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:42.092
I truly love your granddaughter.

01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:52.102
Walk away!

01:18:56.482 --> 01:19:00.527
Maggie! Maggie!
Maggie? Maggie? Maggie?

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:01.570
Give me a hand.

01:19:15.793 --> 01:19:18.837
Hey, Tray.
How's the new batch of jalopies?

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.808
Any word about your grandma?

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:37.356
It's been two weeks
since she collapsed.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.152
Doctors are trying
to stay optimistic, but...

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:45.197
I can't help thinking...

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:48.867
I did this.

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:52.329
No, Tracey. Don't say that.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:54.039
I thought
it would make her happy.

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.083
I thought...

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.261
It's the hospital.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:10.889
Grandma.

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:21.233
How are you?

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.069
Ring.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:25.112
Ring?

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:29.199
Oh, right, the prop ring.
I totally forgot about it.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:32.077
Yeah. I think
I threw it in my purse.

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:33.996
You wanna see it? Yeah?

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.498
Okay. It should be in here somewhere.

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:39.752
You're right.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:42.046
I should probably mail it
back to him.

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:43.964
Or directly to the prop house
he got it from.

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:48.052
Not a prop.

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.178
It's real.

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:52.139
His mother's.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.935
I don't understand.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:59.480
Find his father.

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.115
Oh.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.751
Can I help you?

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:22.961
Yes.
Are you Arthur Hollingsworth?

01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:24.505
I am.

01:21:24.505 --> 01:21:26.131
Mr. Hollingsworth, my name is...

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.050
Tracey Westmoreland.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.384
Yes.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:32.262
You look exactly
as Rob described you.

01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:36.600
I think I have something
that belongs to you.

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:44.525
I've not seen that
in a long time.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.279
Let's grab a seat.

01:21:57.287 --> 01:21:59.581
It belonged to my wife. Lucille.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:06.046
When she passed away,
Rob asked if he could have it.

01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:08.757
He said he wanted to put it
on the finger

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:09.967
of the girl he loved.

01:22:11.218 --> 01:22:12.469
I guess he found her.

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:18.308
I called him the day
before your dress rehearsal...

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:21.562
to ask him if he was sure.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:26.150
That kid's never been more sure
of anything in his life.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.696
He even quit
that Rent-a-Groom job.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.072
He did?

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:34.116
That very morning.

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.785
He said they were parts
he was playing.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.163
He was tired of pretending.

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:42.499
Said he wanted to make it real.

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:46.044
And he wanted
to make it real with you.

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:49.131
Can I ask you, Tracey...

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:52.718
why the cold feet?

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:57.556
I think I heard the wrong end
of that phone call earlier.

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:04.771
Hold onto it.

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:09.568
Thank you.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:16.491
Aw, sweetie.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:23.123
Well, did I miss anything
while I was away?

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:24.499
Grams.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:29.171
Did you find his father?

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.214
Yes.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.298
And the ring?

01:23:31.298 --> 01:23:32.758
I have it.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:38.180
Grams.
I never meant to hurt you.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.057
Oh.

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:41.350
Listen, kiddo.

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:45.103
I've written enough
romance novels in my time

01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:47.856
to know what true love
looks like.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.858
I think I may have believed
your story

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:52.945
because you were falling
in love.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:54.613
You can't fake that.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:24:00.786
So, I have one question for you.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.371
Yes?

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:06.625
Why are you still sitting here?

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:08.168
Hmm?

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:09.378
Tracey.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:10.671
I don't know
where they're shooting,

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:12.214
but I know they wrap today.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.633
- Then...
- He leaves for LA.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.275
Hi.

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.072
Hi.

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:39.783
How did you find me?

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:41.201
Shelley told me you were here.

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:42.494
Maggie, is she all right?

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:44.454
She had an accident.

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:45.414
Right after you left
the dress rehearsal--

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.040
- Oh, no.
- She's all right.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.458
She... she just woke up.

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:52.713
She filled me in...

01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:55.424
on this.

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:01.388
I went to see your dad.

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:03.640
You did?

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.978
He told me everything.

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:14.109
But you're still here.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.111
The show, I thought
it went to LA.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.196
Yeah, it did without me.

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:20.699
I quit.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:22.367
- But, Rob--
- Tracey.

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:25.370
I thought this was my big break,

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.165
but I realized
over these last few days...

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:30.584
you...

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.713
you've been my big break all along.

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:37.549
And I've been racking my brain
on the drive over here

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:40.510
how to play the scene
where I run across town

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:43.680
and find the beautiful
book editor, and tell her

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.017
how madly in love
I am with her.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.022
I think I can help you
run some lines.

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:07.329
What do I do with this?

01:26:08.789 --> 01:26:09.831
Hold on to it.

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:13.168
It'll play in the later scene.
