WEBVTT

01:28.505 --> 01:29.672
Unbelievable.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.510
I should have known.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.346
She played me even before we crashed here.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.598
I fell for it like a sucker.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.060
I blame my innate sense of compassion.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.396
You tried to profit off of our survival.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.357
Nothing illegal about that.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.817
You also smuggle booze.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.652
How did this become about me?

01:51.611 --> 01:55.865
Look, the point is I use my own name.
I didn't steal it off some guy.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.953
Wonder what happened to him.
The real Dr. Smith.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.417
Anyone else feel that?
It was a tremor, I think.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.710
I'm calling home.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.546
Hold on.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.257
No one's listening to me.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.884
Here's my expert opinion on someone
who's been busted once or twice.

02:15.844 --> 02:19.639
A person like fake Dr. Smith
needs to be confronted face-to-face.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.975
You look her in the eye
and you dare her to lie again.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.936
No. What did I just say?

02:25.603 --> 02:27.856
C

02:32.861 --> 02:35.280
C

02:38.074 --> 02:40.743
Jupiter 2<i> to C-11.</i>
<i>Hello, Judy.</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:49.794
It's Dr. Smith.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.423
Yeah, I know who you are.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.427
Is everything all right?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.556
We're great.
Can you put my mom on, please?

03:05.351 --> 03:08.479
Her door's closed.
Would you like me to leave her a message?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.024
No, I'll tell her myself. Thank you.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.486
Could you be more suspicious?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.697
She's been staying in our Jupiter,
eating at our table.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.073
I even loaned her moisturizer.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.203
You think that's funny?
Well...

03:24.287 --> 03:26.998
-Relax.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.836
Your mom can handle
any version of Dr. Smith.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.966
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.302
I should've read the signs.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.679
Angela was in such despair.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.515
She kept reliving the attack
over and over again.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.934
She was so helpless.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.937
Couldn't have known she'd have the means
to act on her feelings.

03:58.363 --> 04:02.533
R-3940. That's our watermark.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.121
This gun wasn't smuggled here from Earth.
It was made on our printer.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.957
By who?

04:11.876 --> 04:13.211
I told you it wasn't me.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.088
The robot printed the gun.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
What

04:19.759 --> 04:20.718
For me.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.556
I was scared, and I guess he thought
it was what I wanted.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.724
You knew about this?

04:26.808 --> 04:29.686
I'm sorry. I... I didn't want it.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.439
So I hid it.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.400
Where?

04:40.738 --> 04:43.449
At least now we know where she got it.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.370
Someone found it, but it wasn't her.
She wasn't working on the light tower.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.538
She was still laid up.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.623
That just leaves everyone else.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.543
The whole camp came aboard
at one time or another.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.840
Hey, why don't you go get a snack?

05:06.681 --> 05:11.936
Why would someone give Angela a gun?
It shows particularly poor judgment.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.398
To give a troubled woman a weapon,
when it was clear what she would do.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.400
Uh, I...

05:17.483 --> 05:21.988
I thought it was strange that...
that he was lingering around the quarters

05:22.071 --> 05:24.324
when there was so much work
to be done elsewhere.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.534
-Victor.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.538
He wasn't exactly a fan of the robot
at the meeting.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.497
I don't know.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.377
Victor Dhar is a lot of things,
but I...

05:36.461 --> 05:39.339
You'd be surprised what a man will do
to protect his family.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.136
If we're gonna find out
who gave Angela the gun,

05:45.219 --> 05:46.637
we need to go and talk to her.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.724
Just please be gentle with her.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.935
Angela is in a fragile place.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.774
She wasn't too fragile
to put three bullet holes in my ship.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.788
Okay.

06:14.874 --> 06:15.833
No sneaking off.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.253
Really? 'Cause it's kind of, like,
my thing.

06:19.754 --> 06:20.963
I'm serious.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.425
I don't need to tell you that
your brother's going through a hard time.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.309
And yet you told me anyway.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.089
-We should switch.
-No, I'm fine.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.384
You probably have a concussion, too.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.345
I've had plenty of concussions.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.982
I'm fine, really.

07:22.024 --> 07:25.111
I'm not arguing.
Would you like me to argue?

07:37.206 --> 07:38.458
What was that?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.042
I don't know.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.214
-Look out!

07:48.426 --> 07:49.969
-John!
-Hold on.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.478
Go, go, go!

08:25.171 --> 08:28.883
You remember when I mentioned
increased seismic activity?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.385
I do now.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.560
Okay, let's get out of here.

09:03.042 --> 09:03.960
Ugh.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.586
Tar.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.714
Tar pit, actually.

09:11.217 --> 09:15.388
Think we can walk on this?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.651
We'll be fine.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.947
I mean, this is hardly the worst situation
we've ever been in, right?

09:47.336 --> 09:49.380
Well, we're not going back this way.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.675
There's only one way we can go.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.103
It's remarkably predictable.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.397
It's better than Old Faithful.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.190
So, intervals between eruptions

10:08.274 --> 10:11.068
gives us three minutes and 27 seconds
to get across.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.779
Top speed of the Chariot is...

10:13.988 --> 10:17.074
We can't go at top speed.
We're lugging 3,000 gallons of fuel

10:17.158 --> 10:20.119
which weighs, conservatively,
9,000 pounds.

10:20.202 --> 10:23.080
That'll be what, 35 miles an hour
to go how far?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.293
1.78 miles.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.295
1.78 miles.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.839
We don't have a choice.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.676
It's gonna be tight.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.460
The second they stop, we drive like hell.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.018
Now!

11:53.796 --> 11:55.089
Three minutes left.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.010
Come on, baby.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.597
Please, if anything breaks, I'll fix it,
but get us across the finish line, okay?

12:09.770 --> 12:11.522
This is as fast as we can go.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.441
It's more than enough. We're on pace.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.110
Two minutes, 45 seconds.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.165
My brakes are seizing up.

12:30.624 --> 12:31.917
Why are they slowing down?

12:38.174 --> 12:41.010
Hey, your control cable's loose.
I can see it from here.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.137
Two minutes, 30 seconds.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.389
-I can't maintain this speed.
-You have to.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.852
-I'm on it.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.480
The roof. Just keep driving.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.193
Good luck.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.658
-Hold it steady.
-Yeah.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.503
-Evan, be careful, please.
-Two minutes.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.506
Dude, I'm a surfer.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.385
Was a surfer.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.889
Come on. Come on, Evan.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.391
He better make this quick.
-Come on. Come on, Evan.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.935
One minute, 30 seconds.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.402
<i>Evan... Okay.</i>
<i>Careful, careful, careful, please.</i>

13:42.821 --> 13:44.198
Come on, Evan.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.076
Dude's got big marbles,
I'll give him that.  Careful, careful, careful, careful.

13:49.328 --> 13:53.123
-One minute. We have to go faster.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.425
Forty-five seconds.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.190
-He did it.
<i>30 seconds.</i>

14:20.317 --> 14:21.861
Not out of the woods yet. Come on.

14:26.782 --> 14:27.825
Fifteen.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.915
We're almost clear.

14:39.169 --> 14:42.423
Five, four, three, two--

14:44.842 --> 14:45.759
-Whoa!
Whoa!

14:45.843 --> 14:47.553
No, no! Come on!

14:48.053 --> 14:49.305
Where'd he go

14:53.642 --> 14:55.060
Open the door.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.195
Move! Move! Move!

15:05.279 --> 15:07.114
Okay.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.035
Hey, hey, I'm here
to take care of you, okay? Okay.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.333
His pulse is weak.
Okay, I need something for the pain.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.376
-Hold his head and neck still.
-Okay.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.464
-We need to move the tank now.
-Do it.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.383
Grab the sling, attach it to the tank.
I'll pull the Chariot into position.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.509
Let's go.

15:30.054 --> 15:34.308
Hey. Hey. Hey, stay with me.
Hang in there.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.561
It's okay.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.613
Wait. Wait. This isn't gonna work.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.948
Why?

15:49.406 --> 15:51.825
The tank has landed on a rock.
It's stuck in like a plug.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.160
We've got to find another way.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.705
Wait! Stop!

15:56.789 --> 15:58.499
I just need an inch.
We can slide him out.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.460
The tank's pressurized.
If we lift it, we're gonna lose the fuel.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.382
Radio the Jupiters.
Have them send a replacement tanker.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.967
-Right away.
-Can siphon off the fuel.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.426
It'll take them hours to get here.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.429
He'll go into renal failure by then.
We need to move the tank. This is a horrible situation.
But we trained for this when we signed up.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.393
Let's not let emotions dictate
what we do next.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.061
This isn't about my emotions.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.313
Judy, how many patients
have you actually treated?

16:21.397 --> 16:23.899
Ones where you weren't supervised
by a real doctor?

16:28.028 --> 16:28.862
Two.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.031
-Yes, but--

16:31.115 --> 16:33.742
I think you're doing the best you can,
and I commend you for that.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.495
I wanna help Evan and I'm gonna help him.

16:36.578 --> 16:40.416
But that fuel could save your family.
Save his family, right?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.212
Send for that replacement tanker.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.717
Let's find a container
to catch the leaking fuel.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.719
We won't waste a drop if we don't have to.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.471
Let's check these hose couplings
haven't been damaged.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.807
Beckert, move the tank.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.392
-Judy, calm down.
-Don't touch me.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.020
-I'm not losing that fuel.
-And I'm not losing him.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.272
He stopped breathing! Judy!

17:05.816 --> 17:08.235
Okay.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.823
One, two, three...
Somebody move the tank!

17:13.574 --> 17:15.159
I'm sorry! No!

17:15.242 --> 17:17.578
One, two, three... Don?

17:18.620 --> 17:20.456
One, two, three...

17:20.539 --> 17:22.041
Ah, damn it. You do it, you can forget that money.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.003
Yeah, well, you're an asshole.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.966
One, two, three...

17:31.675 --> 17:35.304
Evan Evan, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.556
Look at me. Look at me. It's okay.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.677
Am I gonna die?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.471
Not today.

18:20.057 --> 18:24.019

18:24.853 --> 18:26.730

you know.

18:29.441 --> 18:33.028

Great, thank you. Good to hear.
Um, I'm sneaking out now.

Come on. Nothing?

20:17.507 --> 20:20.677
Maybe, like, a chuckle

20:21.011 --> 20:22.346
I thought you left.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.599
Okay.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.563
Severed head gag deserves
at least an eye roll.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.779
Haven't you already built,
like, three of these?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.989
Can't you just leave me alone?

20:42.366 --> 20:45.702
Okay. Fine, whatever. I just, um...

20:56.505 --> 20:58.465
-Yeah!

20:58.548 --> 21:02.219
This is so dangerous!

21:02.302 --> 21:04.471
Yeah!

21:06.890 --> 21:07.724
Yeah!

21:13.272 --> 21:15.399
-So dangerous!

21:15.482 --> 21:17.025
Yeah!

21:18.527 --> 21:22.531
Three, two, one, stop.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.249
Ooh!  Whoa.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.629
Whoa.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.176
You good?

21:44.886 --> 21:46.555
-Yes!

21:46.638 --> 21:48.056
Yes!

21:53.061 --> 21:54.521
Hey, hey, what just happened?

21:55.605 --> 21:56.857
I think I'm done.

21:57.357 --> 22:00.610
No, come on. We gotta beat your record.
What are you doing?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.737
Thanks, Penny.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.116
But... I think I'm done.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.785
This was fun.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.099
Sorry you had to be
broken apart like this,

22:31.183 --> 22:33.477
but, uh, I'll get you back together.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.481
I know you can't hear me. I'm not crazy.

22:39.566 --> 22:43.862
It's just, when you spend so long
pretending to be something you're not,

22:44.821 --> 22:49.242
sometimes you have to say things out loud
to remind yourself of what's true.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.457
My name's not Smith.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.169
It's June Harris.

23:07.302 --> 23:12.307
The truth... I'm no different
from the Robinsons.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.018
I wanna put the past behind me...

23:16.478 --> 23:20.607
and have a fresh start, just like them.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.696
The truth is...

23:28.281 --> 23:30.784
I'm going to be a productive member
of the colony.

23:36.581 --> 23:41.169
Unless Captain Radic, up at the<i> Resolute,</i>
tosses me out of the airlock first.

23:44.422 --> 23:46.258
And the truth...

23:48.385 --> 23:50.637
that Radic can't seem to understand...

23:51.930 --> 23:56.101
is that... is that I'm a good person.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.689
I'm not a violent person.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.859
I'm not a killer,

24:04.901 --> 24:06.319
like you.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.989
You were made to kill.

24:14.161 --> 24:19.791
The truth is that I'm not going to do
any of the bad things

24:19.875 --> 24:21.376
that are going to happen.

24:23.837 --> 24:24.880
You are.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.557
You sure it's back here?

24:36.683 --> 24:37.684
Check under the HAB.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.686
Uh-huh.

24:42.772 --> 24:43.732
Please be in here.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.362
Yes!

24:50.989 --> 24:53.700
Great. Okay. Now...

24:57.954 --> 24:59.498
No.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.582
You fix it?

25:06.046 --> 25:08.757
Sorry. I thought maybe
someone would hear us.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.427
You've given up
on the radio, then?

25:12.510 --> 25:14.387
Well, we've got a problem
with the antenna.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.722
Hmm

25:16.348 --> 25:17.557
It's out there.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.976
On the shore.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.729
You sheared it off
when you off-roaded backwards

25:22.812 --> 25:23.939
through the forest.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.859
Very impressively.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.654
-I thought so.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.368
You got some flex?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.509
Of all the times for Penny to agree

25:52.592 --> 25:54.427
to stay in the Jupiter
and not come looking for us.

25:54.511 --> 25:58.473
Yeah. When we get back,
gonna have to have a serious talk about the importance of knowing
when not to obey your parents.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.237
Pass it up to me, okay?

26:17.951 --> 26:19.494
Well, we're still sinking.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.171
Here.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.173
Thanks.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.532
Damn.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.452
Weren't you a Navy SEAL?

27:00.535 --> 27:02.996
Didn't you guys practice
these sort of things?

27:03.330 --> 27:05.707
Uh, just you watch.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.042
Just warming up.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.132
-Okay.
-John.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.300
You watching?

27:16.134 --> 27:17.093
John.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.348
John!

27:21.973 --> 27:24.017
Got it!

27:26.311 --> 27:28.313
-John, get in.

27:28.396 --> 27:29.981
It's too late. Get in.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.401
-Damn.
-Come on.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.819
Damn it.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.173
Okay.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.514
How much fuel did we lose?

28:04.099 --> 28:06.768
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

28:10.230 --> 28:13.024
Is it too soon to ask
if I'll ever walk again?

28:15.068 --> 28:18.488
As soon we get back,
I'll be able to properly examine you.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.160
It's okay.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.455
I know an engineer
who designs prosthetics.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.792
She could print me
a bitchin' pair of legs.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.588
Well, you can teach me to surf.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.186
You saved his life.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.607
All I did was hit the gas pedal.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.862
I'm sorry about your money.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.532
Me, too.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.256
Do we have enough fuel
to get us off the planet?

29:19.799 --> 29:20.800
Not everyone.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.661
So, what can I do to help?

29:51.122 --> 29:52.999
You hate building models.

29:53.082 --> 29:57.253
Yeah, 'cause it's boring and tedious.
I'm willing to give it a try.

29:58.379 --> 30:04.719
Okay. Um, "Release the main L body panel
from parts sheet A.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.932
Fold a crease in each
of the six vertical hinges in the part."

30:10.391 --> 30:12.227
Okay, well, no wonder
it's taking you so long.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.103
You're putting the wrong pieces together.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.162
Wanted to make something
to remember him by.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.293
It's okay to miss him.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.713
He was my friend, too.

30:49.430 --> 30:52.058
So, are we just making this up
as we go along,

30:52.141 --> 30:53.726
or is there a method to this madness?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.231
Yeah. Yeah, um...

30:59.607 --> 31:01.526
Thought we could use these as his hands.

31:01.609 --> 31:06.573
Yes, I like that.
But we need something big.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.116
Maybe this?

31:18.543 --> 31:20.503
Come on, fuse together.

31:25.633 --> 31:29.762
This is exactly what Will did,
so why aren't you working?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.521
What else do you need from me?

31:47.572 --> 31:50.950
-In principle.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.622
The line you threw to the tree
is conductive.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.374
Oh, God, this heat.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.252
So, it should act as an antenna

32:01.336 --> 32:05.798
if we can make an unbroken connection
for the signal.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.489
I'll admit it's ad hoc.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.539
That apartment we had in Glendale
with the broken AC.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.584
That was hotter.
-Yeah.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.170
-And somehow smellier.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.422
-How many weekends did we spend

32:46.506 --> 32:49.217
wandering around that mall
just trying to keep cool?

32:49.300 --> 32:52.095
I never ate so many
Wetzel's Pretzels in all my life.

32:54.889 --> 32:58.768
Hey, you have a Ph.D in Engineering.
Why did you never fix the AC?

32:59.644 --> 33:02.939
Kids liked the pretzels.
We were having fun.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.150
Huh.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.662
You know, when...

33:19.330 --> 33:21.833
when everything went sideways and...

33:22.834 --> 33:25.753
and I went and re-upped...

33:28.047 --> 33:30.383
-You don't have to.
-I thought it was the right thing to do.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.468
Yeah, well, you made that clear
at the time.

33:32.552 --> 33:33.803
Well, I was wrong.

33:37.890 --> 33:38.891
I regret it.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.687
You know...

33:44.439 --> 33:46.024
some things you learn over time

33:46.107 --> 33:49.694
and some things,
you have to be kicked in the face.

33:53.239 --> 33:57.118
And when you called and you told me
that you were taking the kids...

33:58.995 --> 34:00.496
to start a new life...

34:06.544 --> 34:07.712
that's when I knew.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.218
Hey.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.514
Hey, I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

34:27.940 --> 34:31.527
I wanted to go to space so bad,

34:31.611 --> 34:36.532
and I couldn't imagine us staying on Earth
the way it was.

34:39.535 --> 34:42.663
He tried so hard,
but he... he couldn't do it.

34:44.457 --> 34:45.333
Will?

34:47.376 --> 34:48.878
He failed the test.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.716
I don't understand.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.930
I cheated to get him on the<i> Resolute.</i>

35:01.182 --> 35:04.310
If it wasn't for me,
none of us would be stranded here.

35:05.853 --> 35:06.854
Hey.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.860
You wanted a better life for our kids.

35:15.154 --> 35:18.282
You did what any mother
would've wanted to do,

35:18.366 --> 35:19.992
but only you could do.

35:45.852 --> 35:49.814
Middle of three boys, huh?
Must've been pretty wild in your house.

35:49.897 --> 35:50.857
Yeah.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.359
Fridge was always bare.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.655
And wrestling matches for the remote.
The usual.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.032
Are you close to your siblings?

36:01.117 --> 36:02.577
Yeah, we're pretty tight.

36:06.789 --> 36:11.335
Phil, he's already at the colony
with his horrible wife.

36:13.129 --> 36:16.007
My big brother Kai
is stuck here with me.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.976
Can you turn down the air?
It's kind of cold in here.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.981
-I didn't turn on the air.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.986
All right, he's going into shock.
I need a blanket.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.125
Okay.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.465
Okay. Okay.

36:58.799 --> 36:59.634
Okay.

37:02.011 --> 37:03.471
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

37:04.764 --> 37:07.016
-Okay.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.651
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

37:18.778 --> 37:19.904
Come on, Evan. Come on, Evan.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.909
No, no, no, no, no, no. Evan.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.535
All right. All right. All right.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.455
<i>Victor, come in.</i>

38:17.962 --> 38:19.130
What is it?

38:26.512 --> 38:27.722
Evan's dead.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.864
We sacrificed the fuel for nothing.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.350
Oh, great.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.310
Okay.

39:17.897 --> 39:23.569
I'll, uh, just find another power source
to hook the radio up to.

39:26.572 --> 39:27.406
Maureen.

39:38.667 --> 39:39.668
Maureen.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.171
So?

39:45.549 --> 39:48.260
If it can handle space,
it can handle a little tar.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.473
-There's only one of them.
-Yeah.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.853
I am fixing the radio.
Stop distracting me.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.397
Maureen, listen to me.

39:59.855 --> 40:02.233
How long have we been
rebreathing this air?

40:02.316 --> 40:04.819
I mean, soon there's gonna be
too much carbon dioxide,

40:04.902 --> 40:07.655
and then we'll pass out.
And if we pass out, we die.

40:07.738 --> 40:10.616
-John.
-I'll open the hatch and you can get out.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.911
If you open the hatch,
the Chariot will fill with tar.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.413
You won't survive.

40:15.746 --> 40:16.914
But you will.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.252
-I'm not doing it.
-Yeah, you are.

40:23.045 --> 40:26.215
I'm not giving up. Since when are you?

40:26.507 --> 40:30.636
This isn't giving up.
This is saving your life.

40:32.888 --> 40:33.806
No.

40:34.723 --> 40:35.766
Maureen.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.061
You put this suit on.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.896
You go get our kids.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.357
And you get 'em off this planet.

40:45.651 --> 40:46.735
All right?

40:49.655 --> 40:50.656
All right?

41:37.203 --> 41:40.206
Okay. Now, when I open the hatch,

41:40.289 --> 41:42.333
you're gonna be hit by a ton of weight
from the tar.

41:42.416 --> 41:45.669
I'll get underneath you
and do the best I can to help you out.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.258
I don't think I can do it.

41:51.342 --> 41:54.053
Hey. Yes, you can.

41:54.637 --> 41:55.638
Yes, you can.

41:57.056 --> 42:00.643
You are the strongest,
most fearless person I know.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.898
I wish I hadn't spent so much time
being angry at you.

42:07.274 --> 42:10.277
I wish we could walk around that mall
one last time.

42:12.154 --> 42:13.155
Maureen...

42:13.864 --> 42:14.990
Don't.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.075
I love you.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.789
Let's do it. It's time.

42:23.749 --> 42:26.418
-Put this on. Come on.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.098
Okay, listen.

42:41.225 --> 42:44.728
When I open the hatch,
you go like there's fire under your ass.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.981
And you don't look back. Okay?

42:47.064 --> 42:48.274
Come on. Come on.

42:58.158 --> 43:00.035
Wait, stop. Stop.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.705
-Take this off.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.209
What?

43:07.293 --> 43:09.044
The Chariot's airtight.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.590
If we can create enough pressure in here,
we could displace the tar.

43:13.048 --> 43:16.093
-The helium. From the HAB.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.933
I don't understand.
This will get us up to the surface,

43:23.017 --> 43:25.102
but we're still stuck
in the middle of a pit.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.812
You remember when Penny was two

43:26.895 --> 43:29.148
and we bought her that...
that play tunnel...

43:29.231 --> 43:31.692
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

43:31.775 --> 43:33.360
That's what we're gonna do
with the balloon.

43:33.736 --> 43:35.362
Our body weight will carry us down.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.573
We can crawl along the bottom
until we reach the shore.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.325
Can't believe I didn't think of it before.

43:39.408 --> 43:41.452
Yeah, because it was, like, so obvious.

45:40.279 --> 45:41.905
I love you, too.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.065
I'll take the tanker back to my Jupiter.

46:17.149 --> 46:19.526
We can reconvene in the morning
and go over options.

46:20.319 --> 46:21.653
Copy.

46:34.374 --> 46:36.251
I really thought I could save him.

46:36.919 --> 46:39.463
You did everything you could,
Dr. Robinson.

46:46.470 --> 46:49.056
I have to go tell his brother
what happened to him.

46:49.973 --> 46:51.058
I'll drive you.

47:12.996 --> 47:14.957
I knew you'd make it back safely.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.917
I'm so glad to see you.

47:24.967 --> 47:25.884
Victor?

47:28.345 --> 47:31.181
Everything's going to be okay. I promise.

47:36.603 --> 47:37.938
We had it, son.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.191
More than enough.

47:41.275 --> 47:42.276
What happened?

47:44.236 --> 47:46.863
There was an accident. We lost it all.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.284
Almost all.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.956
We're just gonna have to stay here
a little longer now.

47:56.331 --> 47:57.749
How... How much longer?

47:58.375 --> 48:02.337
I don't know.
We're stuck here until we figure it out.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.802
There's something I need to tell you.

48:15.851 --> 48:18.312
Okay. Check it out.

48:19.313 --> 48:20.355
Mini Will.

48:21.189 --> 48:23.525
-Well...

48:28.614 --> 48:30.198
But it's so good.

48:31.491 --> 48:33.744
Would you honestly eat your own brother?

48:33.827 --> 48:36.455
Yes.
I think if the situation called for it.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.374
I mean,
we're not out of MREs or anything.

48:42.252 --> 48:45.172
<i>This is Will Robinson</i>
<i>of the 24th Colonist Group. </i>

48:46.089 --> 48:51.762
<i>I'm making a record of this</i>
<i>because it seems I'm the first human </i>

48:52.346 --> 48:55.390
<i>to discover evidence</i>
<i>of an alien intelligence.</i>

48:58.936 --> 49:00.812
<i>It appears it crashed when we did.</i>

49:01.396 --> 49:04.191
<i>Why? I don't know why.</i>

49:06.902 --> 49:08.528
<i>It appears it crashed when we did.</i>

49:09.488 --> 49:12.658
<i> I don't know why.</i>

49:12.741 --> 49:15.327
<i>I don't even know why we crashed.</i>

49:55.867 --> 49:58.412
Did she tell you how long we have
before the planet dies?

50:01.331 --> 50:02.374
No.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.093
Vijay...

50:15.470 --> 50:17.180
Get the Jupiter ready.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.934
We're getting off this damn planet.
