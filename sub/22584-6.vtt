00:02.440 --> 00:04.271
Previously on Enterprise:

00:04.400 --> 00:07.790
Jonathan Archer, what brings you here?

00:12.640 --> 00:14.631
Someone attacked
a Klingon bird-of-prey.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.513
The entire crew was massacred,
the ship's missing.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.119
They were Augments.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.958
You were leading us before.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.398
-Now he is, and you can't accept that.
-Why shouldn't I lead?

00:25.520 --> 00:27.829
Augments should be led by Augments.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.709
We've been authorised to use whatever
force necessary to stop Soong.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.875
We know you can get to the embryos.
Give us what we came for.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.589
You'll tell us what we want to hear,
or you'll watch him die, too.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.354
Every stasis field in this station
will shut down...

00:44.480 --> 00:46.357
releasing hundreds of pathogens.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.357
I wonder which one will kill you first.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.198
There's no way to stop it from here.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.788
-Somewhere else?
-The primary junction.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.316
And now, the conclusion.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.356
-Containment breach in 40 seconds.
-He's almost there.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.671
I'm at the primary junction.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.439
You have to divert the secondary relays.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.516
The panel to the left.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.439
I see them.

01:16.760 --> 01:17.909
Twenty seconds.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.472
He's isolated this room.
The pathogens can't reach us.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.152
What about the Captain?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.234
The ventilation grid...

01:32.360 --> 01:35.079
is going to carry the pathogens
through the rest of the station...

01:35.200 --> 01:36.918
including the central core.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.949
-How long do I have?
-Less than a minute.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.914
It's been a long road

01:51.600 --> 01:53.989
Gettin' from there to here

01:55.360 --> 01:56.952
It's been a long time

01:58.320 --> 02:01.835
But my time is finally near

02:02.280 --> 02:05.317
and I will see my dream
come alive at last

02:06.520 --> 02:09.556
I will touch the sky

02:09.680 --> 02:13.116
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:13.400 --> 02:16.392
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:16.520 --> 02:20.752
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:20.960 --> 02:23.758
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:23.880 --> 02:28.317
I've got faith to believe

02:28.440 --> 02:31.238
I can do anything

02:31.360 --> 02:35.069
I've got strength of the soul

02:35.680 --> 02:38.638
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:38.760 --> 02:42.036
I can reach any star

02:44.200 --> 02:46.316
I've got faith

02:47.880 --> 02:50.030
I've got faith

02:51.520 --> 02:54.671
Faith of the heart

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074

03:04.080 --> 03:06.071
-Archer to T'Pol.
-Go ahead.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.395
Can you get a transporter lock on me?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.796
There's too much interference
from the core.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.275
You'll have to get farther away.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.033
Arm the phase-cannons.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.315
Target exterior hatch J-9.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.792
-Captain, the core will decompress.
-That's the idea.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.710
Stand by on the transporter.
You'll only have a few seconds.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.594
Acknowledged.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.315
Warning. Pathogens detected
in the central core.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.396
-T'Pol!
- We're ready.

03:40.880 --> 03:41.835
Fire!

03:53.160 --> 03:55.116
Commander, do you have him?

03:56.080 --> 03:58.071
Yeah, we need a medic down here.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.195
We've crossed into Klingon space.

04:17.279 --> 04:20.113
-Where's Enterprise?
-They're holding position.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.151
Archer's not foolish enough to follow us.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.236
We won't be seeing Archer again.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.758
What are you saying?

04:28.440 --> 04:29.475
He's dead.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.916
No one was to be killed
without my express order!

04:42.040 --> 04:45.828
I had no choice.
He attacked us, tried to escape.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.796
If you disobey me again,
I'll lock you in the targ pit.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.751
You won't see the light of day
for a month.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.236
-Do I make myself clear?
-Yes, Father.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.034
-What's our speed?
-Holding at warp 3.8.

05:02.160 --> 05:06.039
Not fast enough. The port inducer
assembly's been damaged.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.436
-Go to Engineering and repair it.
-I'm not an engineer.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.198
You're a bright boy, Malik.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.071
First Officer's Log, supplemental.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.556
We've evacuated the Away Team
and all personnel from the station.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.559
The Captain shows no sign of infection.
He's recovering in Sickbay.

05:38.680 --> 05:42.116
They crossed the Klingon border
approximately two hours ago.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.629
Soong's not even bothering
to cover his tracks.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.274
He knows the Klingons will intercept us
if we follow him.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.595
They have half a dozen patrols
in the area.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.632
Is there something we can do to keep
from showing up on their sensors?

05:52.760 --> 05:55.149
I could paint a bird-of-prey on the hull.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.630
Perhaps we could fake
a Klingon warp signature.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.078
I'd have to reconfigure
the coil assembly.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.432
It would take a few hours,
but it should be doable.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.516
What's the status of C-12?

06:09.640 --> 06:11.631
Dr Lucas and his team
would like to return...

06:11.760 --> 06:13.751
and begin decontamination procedures.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.438
That's quite a mess they gotta clean up.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.232
He estimates it will take
more than a year.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.436
Once we're safely through
Klingon space...

06:21.560 --> 06:23.949
we'll set a course for these coordinates.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.434
The Klingons call it Klach D'kel Brakt.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.350
I call it the Briar Patch.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.472
-It's a little catchier, don't you think?
-Briar Patch?

06:36.200 --> 06:39.510
You should have read more of the books
I left for you.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.508
The region is flooded with radiation
from supernova remnants.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.517
Klingons have never mapped it.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.473
There are signs of at least...

06:47.600 --> 06:50.558
two habitable planets
inside the Briar Patch.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.397
-It's unlikely anyone will find us.
-This is your plan?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.278
To hide again?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.478
The embryos need to mature
in a safe environment.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.955
Starfleet isn't going to give up so easily.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.038
They'll send other ships.
This gas cloud won't protect us.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.470
All right, what course would you set?

07:13.920 --> 07:15.478
I'm not certain.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.920
But I know
that running away isn't the answer.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.950
Are you familiar with the name
Botany Bay?

07:26.280 --> 07:28.635
It's a penal colony
on the shores of Australia.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.958
It's also the name of a pre-warp vessel
launched at the end of the Great Wars.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.833
The ship carried many of our brethren...

07:35.960 --> 07:40.476
-including Khan Noonien Singh.
-Botany Bay is a myth.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.556
There's no evidence it ever existed.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.148
All records of the launch
were destroyed.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.474
They didn't want to be followed.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.639
Even if you're right, the ship was lost,
never to be heard from again.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.591
Exactly my point.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.632
Khan was a great leader,
but he made one fatal mistake.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.638
He ran from his enemies
rather than face them.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.354
We've spent our entire lives
running and hiding.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.675
When are we going to make a stand?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.791
The matter is not open for debate.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.151
Alter our heading.
Set a course 1-8-4 mark 3.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.589
We're going to the Briar Patch.
I'll be in my lab.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.437
I wasn't aware the Doctor
discharged you.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.391
He didn't. What's our status?

08:31.520 --> 08:33.875
Holding position
near the Klingon border.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.917
Bridge to Engineering.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.634
-Are we ready?
-I've realigned the warp coils.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.513
We should look like
a Klingon battle cruiser to their sensors.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.837
But this trick's not going to work
if we get within 80,000 kilometres.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.394
Understood. Tactical Alert.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.037
Take us in, Travis. Warp 4.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.359
Come in, Malik.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.713
You asked for me?

09:14.200 --> 09:18.478
You have to stop challenging
my authority in front of the others.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.956
Can't a son disagree with his father?
I thought we were family.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.629
I'm willing to overlook the things
you've done.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.514
But you have to trust that what I'm doing
is best for all of us.

09:31.680 --> 09:35.639
-You used to have faith in me.
-I was a child, I didn't know any better.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.750
-I know it wasn't easy after I left--
-How are the embryos?

09:44.400 --> 09:47.995
I'll be ready to incubate
the first of them in a few hours.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.636
You're manipulating its DNA.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.790
These base-pair sequences...

09:54.920 --> 09:57.798
regulate the neuro-transmitter levels
in their brain.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.390
If I can modify them...

10:01.520 --> 10:04.910
aggression and violent behaviour
will be removed.

10:05.040 --> 10:09.636
-You're changing its personality.
-I'm correcting a defect in its genome.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.236
Genetic engineering was in its infancy
when you were created.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.954
They weren't able to repair
all the mistakes.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.197
Did you fix these mistakes
in the rest of us?

10:19.320 --> 10:21.276
I didn't know how until recently.

10:21.400 --> 10:25.029
What right do you have
to tamper with their genome?

10:25.680 --> 10:27.033
Trust me.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.039
-I know what I'm doing.
-You don't know that this is a defect.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.273
Maybe this is the way our creators
wanted us to be.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.070
Father, you're needed on the Bridge.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.551
There's a ship approaching
at high warp.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.874
Have you identified it?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.831
It appears to be Klingon.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.119
Let's see them.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.677
-This ship has minimal aft weapons.
-lncrease speed.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.637
Arm torpedoes. Open a channel.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.518
This is Captain Archer.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.393
Drop out of warp or we'll disable you.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.670
He sounds pretty confident
for a dead man.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.712
Aft torpedoes.
Target their propulsion systems.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.551
-Forward plating's holding.
-Return fire.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.670
-Aft shields at 50%.
-We should engage them.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.597
They outgun us three to one.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.393
-Father!
-The Denobulan pilot.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.638
Put her aboard the shuttle. Go!

11:39.560 --> 11:42.120
Scan for any planets
along our flight path.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.752
-Their warp field's fluctuating.
-Concentrate all fire on their engines.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.238
They've altered course.
They're heading for a planetary system.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.951
-We've reached the coordinates.
-Take us out of warp.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.110
They're moving into a low orbit.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.435
They're opening their shuttlebay doors.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.275
Hold your fire. Magnify.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.716
-Bio-signs on the shuttle?
-One. Denobulan.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.669
-Can you get a transporter lock?
-The atmosphere is too dense.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.995
We're being hailed. It's Soong.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.477
Murdering hostages
is turning into a new hobby for you.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.716
No one's been killed, Captain.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.115
That ship is caught between
two thermal layers.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.754
It should be relatively safe
for four or five hours.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.440
Enough time
for you to mount a rescue mission.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.117
-This isn't over, Doctor.
-Goodbye, Captain.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.318
He's gone to warp.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.750
Disconnect that circuit
before you power the relay.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.235
-You might damage it.
-Warp trail's been dispersed.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.749
-Enterprise won't be able to follow us.
-Excellent work.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.110
There's something else
we need-- Father!

13:38.040 --> 13:40.554
-I need to speak with you.
-What is it?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.313
We've underestimated them.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.431
Starfleet isn't going to stop
until they find us.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.233
And what do you suggest we do?
Turn ourselves in?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.952
Before we left C-12...

13:49.080 --> 13:52.231
I beamed aboard two dozen canisters
of biogenic agents.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.349
You did what?

13:53.480 --> 13:56.392
We can modify a torpedo
to carry the pathogens.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.239
A single torpedo would never make it
through their hull plating.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.590
I wasn't talking about the Enterprise.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.191
We use it against the Klingons.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.959
The Qu'Vat Colony
is less than four light-years away.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.878
If we detonate the torpedo
inside the upper atmosphere...

14:10.000 --> 14:12.594
it'll scatter the pathogen
across the entire planet.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.269
Every organism on the surface
will be dead within days.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.631
When the High Council hears that
humans have decimated their colony...

14:19.760 --> 14:21.955
they'll launch a counter-strike.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.197
The Klingons
will keep Starfleet busy for years.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.198
-What you're proposing is mass murder.
-There is no other choice.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.309
How long will it be...

14:29.440 --> 14:32.796
before Starfleet turns to the Klingons
for help in finding us?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.512
This is the only way
to guarantee our survival.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.239
Go back to the Bridge.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.915
What happened to you in prison?

14:47.840 --> 14:50.115
You're not the man who raised us.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.273
The man who was willing to do
whatever was necessary.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.197
Return to your station.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.112
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.595
We've rescued the pilot
of the Denobulan shuttle.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.517
Fortunately, her injuries were minor.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.995
Trip and T'Pol
are trying to enhance our sensors...

15:14.120 --> 15:16.270
in an effort to find the bird-of-prey.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.075
T arget the directional array
on grid 4-5-9.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.638
How are your parents?

15:37.600 --> 15:38.999
They're fine.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.391
They moved into a new house
in Mississippi.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.432
It's not like the old place
in Panama City, but...

15:44.560 --> 15:48.599
-it's pretty nice. Why do you ask?
-You haven't spoken of them recently.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.916
In fact, you've said very little
since I returned from Vulcan.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.838
There hasn't been a lot of time
to catch up.

15:57.640 --> 16:01.792
You also haven't joined us at
the Captain's table since we left Earth.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.872
-What are you trying to say?
-You've been avoiding me.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.956
Well, maybe I have.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.988
But you got to admit,
it's a little awkward.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.359
I mean, you're married. I know
you did it to help your mother, but...

16:17.040 --> 16:20.157
it's gonna take me a little time to adjust.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.829
I'm still adjusting to it myself.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.717
This is gonna sound strange. But...

16:32.360 --> 16:36.035
as tough as it was watching you
go through with the ceremony...

16:37.920 --> 16:40.036
I was proud of you for what you did.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.355
Yeah, I guess it's probably for the best.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.749
-What do you mean?
-Come on.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.673
It's not like we would have made
an ideal couple.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.631
A Vulcan and a human?

16:58.960 --> 17:01.918
Romeo and Juliet
probably stood a better chance.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.152
Subspace distortion.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.996
-0.4 light-years.
-There's no sign of a warp trail.

17:08.119 --> 17:11.192
They might have concealed
their engine emissions.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.309
-Engineering to Bridge.
-Go ahead.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.590
-I think we found him, Captain.
-You don't sound 100% sure.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.550
It's the best we've got.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.194
Send the coordinates
to Mr Mayweather.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.595
Lay in a pursuit course. Maximum warp.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.273
I don't have a lot of time.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.755
The aft launcher is still off-line,
and Father wants me to--

17:34.880 --> 17:38.236
You won't have to answer to him
any longer. I'm taking command.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.599
You can't.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.836
I've already spoken with everyone
on the Bridge.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.077
They're behind me,
but I need to know where you stand.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.758
You helped me before.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.232
But that was different. This is our father.

17:56.960 --> 18:00.077
He may have raised us,
but that doesn't make him our father.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.714
-He'll never be one of us.
-Don't do this to him.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.751
He's given me no choice.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.352
I have a plan to protect us
from Starfleet and the Klingons...

18:08.480 --> 18:10.357
and he won't even consider it.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.989
You know what he's doing
with the embryos?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.318
He's altering their genome.

18:21.880 --> 18:25.555
Making them weak and docile,
like ordinary humans.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.196
-That's not true.
-Go to his lab, talk to him yourself.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.196
I know how much he means to you.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.396
I have feelings for him, too.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.833
He'll be treated with respect.
You have my word.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.593
Are you with me?

18:59.440 --> 19:01.476
Father, please come with us.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.629
Persis?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.950
Four of you to subdue me?

19:11.080 --> 19:14.277
-The crew is united behind me.
-ls that so?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.755
There's no time for this.
You all have work to do.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.156
Don't make this more difficult
than it needs to be.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.477
And if I refuse, are you going to kill me?

19:23.600 --> 19:24.828
No one else has to die.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.316
What about the millions you plan to kill
with that bio-weapon?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.518
Please, Father, there's no other way.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.238
Lock him in his quarters.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.518
A Klingon battle cruiser...

19:54.640 --> 19:57.552
0.3 light-years away.
They're on an intercept course.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.788
Archer to Engineering.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.797
Is there a problem with the camouflage?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.433
Not that I can see.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.949
Our Klingon warp signature's
holding steady.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.958
They'll be in visual range
in less than two minutes.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.594
Universal translator.
Did you update the database?

20:19.720 --> 20:22.314
It's been programmed
with seven Klingon dialects.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.034
Let's hope this guy speaks one of them.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.074
Open a channel.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.232
Attention, cruiser.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.077
If you come any closer to my ship,
you'll be fired upon.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.519
Who is this?

20:41.680 --> 20:43.796
My name isn't your concern.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.275
You've entered restricted space.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.914
Drop out of warp
and prepare for inspection.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.313
The last time I checked,
this was still Klingon territory.

20:52.440 --> 20:56.638
No ship is allowed to pass through
this system without authorisation...

20:56.760 --> 20:59.228
on the orders of Governor Klag.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.117
I don't take orders from
a mere governor.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.479
We're on important business
for the High Council.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.238
What sort of business?

21:11.280 --> 21:13.430
That matter is classified.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.434
I'm not detecting
a Council transponder signal.

21:17.560 --> 21:20.313
Perhaps you forgot to activate it.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.238
Do you expect me
to turn on a transponder...

21:25.040 --> 21:29.716
and let every ship in the area know
that we have the Chancellor on board?

21:30.480 --> 21:33.040
Chancellor M'Rek is on your ship?

21:33.160 --> 21:35.993
He had important negotiations
with the Orions.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.997
-We're taking him back to Kronos.
-The Orions.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.793
I've heard rumours of his negotiations
with their females.

21:46.920 --> 21:50.356
Tell me,
is it true what they say about them?

21:50.480 --> 21:51.993
If I were you...

21:52.120 --> 21:55.351
I wouldn't be making allegations
about Chancellor M'Rek...

21:55.480 --> 21:57.072
over an unsecure channel.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.956
-I meant no insult.
-I'm sure you didn't.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.229
It would be best if you made no mention
of this to your superiors...

22:08.040 --> 22:12.477
or you might find yourself
commanding a garbage scow.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.079
Understood.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.794
We're honoured to have the Chancellor
in our system.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.195
-Qapla'.
-Qapla'.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.152
They're altering course.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.310
-Don't tell me it's visiting hour.
-I'm sorry, Father.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.432
If I didn't go along with him,
he would have killed me.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.157
You did the right thing.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.150
If he deploys that weapon, he'll be
confirming everything they've said...

22:48.280 --> 22:50.999
about Augments for the last 150 years.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.236
They'll destroy all of you.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.636
You have to help me stop him.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.720
We can sabotage the engines,
or the torpedo launchers--

22:59.840 --> 23:01.398
No, we'll never get to them.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.318
Malik's posted guards
at every vital system.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.951
You have to get me off the ship.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.959
I've disabled the internal sensors.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.559
It should be some time
before anyone notices...

23:26.680 --> 23:28.716
one of the escape pods is missing.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.996
Be careful, he might suspect you.

24:05.760 --> 24:08.399
-What is it?
-An automated beacon.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.398
It's very faint. It could be
a distress signal.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.397
Can you get a fix on it?

24:31.800 --> 24:34.678
Captain, what took you so long?

24:45.040 --> 24:46.712
You have to alter your....

24:50.160 --> 24:52.230
You have to alter your course.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.476
-Is that so?
-My children....

24:55.800 --> 24:59.634
The Augments are planning to attack
a Klingon colony.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.712
What were you doing
in that escape pod?

25:01.840 --> 25:02.875
What do you think?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.788
I was waiting for you.
You're the only one who can stop them.

25:07.480 --> 25:10.631
I didn't come back
because I missed our lively debates.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.716
Please, you have to do as I ask.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.195
Your story doesn't sound very plausible.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.312
I think we were getting close
to finding your Augments.

25:18.440 --> 25:22.228
You may have put yourself
into that escape pod to throw us off.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.713
You're not serious.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.669
You've made it clear
you'll do anything for them.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.153
Lie, murder.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.594
Maybe even sacrifice yourself.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.719
If the Klingons retaliate against Earth...

25:35.840 --> 25:38.638
it'll make the Xindi incident
look like a lovers' quarrel.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.990
What do you care what happens
to Earth?

25:42.200 --> 25:45.431
You believe your children are
the future of humanity.

25:46.000 --> 25:46.955
Captain.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.479
Captain, contact C-12!

25:51.520 --> 25:56.230
Three hundred kilograms of bio-toxins
are missing from their inventory.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.999
Dr Lucas already told me
about the missing toxins.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.712
Malik stole them without my knowledge.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.035
He's going to use them on the colony.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.828
You saw what he did on the station.
You know what he's capable of.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.758
You didn't know?

26:17.280 --> 26:20.033
You had to see him murder someone
in front of you.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.598
What do you want me to say?

26:22.720 --> 26:25.632
That you were right about them
and I was wrong?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.798
Maybe things would have been different
if I'd been there for them.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.831
If Starfleet hadn't locked me away.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.428
None of that
would have mattered in the end.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.792
It's in their nature.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.589
They were engineered to be this way.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.078
"Superior ability breeds
superior ambition."

26:44.200 --> 26:46.236
One of their creators wrote that.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.670
He was murdered by an Augment.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.714
Work with Soong.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.831
He'll show you
how to scan for their warp trail.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.918
I want to intercept them
before they reach the colony.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.430
He may be leading us into a trap.

27:04.840 --> 27:05.875
I believe him.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.479
That planet's over three light-years
away.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.353
We're gonna have to push the engines
pretty hard to get there in time.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.277
-ls that a problem?
-At that speed...

27:12.400 --> 27:15.392
our phoney warp signature
might not fool the Klingons.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.712
Do what you have to do.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.874
You've been quiet.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.468
Soong didn't get off this ship
without help.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.994
The sensor grid
wasn't damaged in the attack.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.715
Someone took it off-line
to cover his escape.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.592
Maybe he disabled it.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.800
He would have needed
the security codes.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.918
I never gave them to him.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.435
If Father didn't do it, then who?

27:57.920 --> 27:59.797
Can you think of anyone?

28:01.720 --> 28:05.508
Lokesh didn't seem that enthusiastic
about your plan to attack the Klingons.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.712
He's been in the weapons bay for
a day and a half, modifying the torpedo.

28:08.840 --> 28:12.071
Maybe I should torture him,
just to make sure.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.958
What do you think?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.195
Only four of us have the codes.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.076
Of those four, you and l
are the only ones...

28:26.200 --> 28:29.033
who weren't on the Bridge
when Soong escaped.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.559
You think I did it?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.797
Your heart's beating faster.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.309
Perhaps it's trying to tell me something.

28:47.920 --> 28:51.037
-Are you going to use that on me?
-lf I have to.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.791
You shouldn't have done that.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.034
I'll miss you.

29:41.360 --> 29:45.399
-How long can we sustain warp 5?
-As long as the Captain wants it.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.634
Or until we blow up,
whichever comes first.

29:49.880 --> 29:53.350
Adjust the scanning frequency,
15 megahertz.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.390
Sorry about that business
with the Orions.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.158
Hope you weren't permanently injured.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.953
Why don't you stay focused
on what you're doing?

30:02.080 --> 30:04.435
Someone's a little protective
of Commander T'Pol.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.516
I just don't like you very much.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.309
-ls that them?
-lt is a ship, but it's not the bird-of-prey.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.471
Captain Archer to the Bridge.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.354
It's a Klingon vessel.
They're on an intercept course.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.393
It's a lot bigger than the last one.
This one's a D5-class battle cruiser.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.637
-How long until we're in visual range?
-Two minutes.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.152
Same as before, Hoshi.

30:31.640 --> 30:33.039
They're hailing us.

30:37.840 --> 30:42.436
Earth vessel.
Surrender and prepare to be boarded.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.193
-Aft plating is failing.
-Hail them again.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.560
If we don't reach the colony
before that bird-of-prey...

30:58.680 --> 31:01.114
millions of your people will be killed.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.152
I'm not detecting any other ships.

31:04.280 --> 31:08.478
-Perhaps you plan to attack the colony.
-Captain, if I may.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.470
Drop out of warp...

31:20.600 --> 31:23.194
or we'll destroy your ship!

31:27.400 --> 31:28.355
I tried.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.316
We may be able to surprise them
with a torpedo if we drop to impulse.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.398
I wouldn't recommend that, Captain.
Their sensors are far superior.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.873
They'll detect it.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.030
They're targeting our reactor.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.236
Power down weapons.
Stand by to deploy the grappler.

31:47.360 --> 31:48.793
Take us out of warp.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.552
They've dropped to impulse.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.830
-Malcolm?
-Two more seconds, Captain.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.673
On my mark, Travis.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.791
They're closing.
They're extending a docking port.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.959
-Malcolm?
-Ready, sir.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.599
Full impulse.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.517
-They're targeting the grappler.
-Hold your speed.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.109
-Shearing force is approaching critical.
-We're losing the grappler!

32:35.240 --> 32:36.719
Hold your speed.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.995
They can't create a warp field.
They're disabled.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.918
Resume course for the colony,
maximum speed.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.680
There are three population centres,
two here...

32:55.800 --> 32:57.438
and another on the northern continent.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.154
We'll detonate the torpedo
over the southern hemisphere.

33:00.280 --> 33:03.317
That will ensure
the maximum number of casualties.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.954
-What's the weapon's status?
-We've modified the warhead.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.878
But we need to test the guidance
protocols before we can--

33:09.000 --> 33:11.230
There's a ship on an intercept course.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.595
The Enterprise. Increase
to maximum speed. Load the torpedo...

33:17.720 --> 33:19.517
stand by to fire
as soon as we drop out of warp.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.915
-But the guidance protocols--
-Do as I say!

33:30.760 --> 33:32.751
They've detected us.
They're accelerating.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.359
Stay with them, Travis.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.515
Tucker to Bridge.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.473
If we go any faster, the nacelles
are gonna fly off the pylons.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.477
How long until we're in weapons range?

33:40.600 --> 33:41.919
Two minutes.

33:42.040 --> 33:45.157
But the bird-of-prey
will reach the colony in 73 seconds.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.593
-Trip.
-I heard, I'll give you what I can.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.515
-How much longer?
-Guidance is still off-line.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.473
-We'll need to get closer.
-Take us into low orbit.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.353
-They're preparing to fire.
-Travis.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.754
Another 15 seconds.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.677
Take us out of warp
as close as you can.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.472
Weapons are standing by.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.478
Ten seconds.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.273
Torpedo's ready.

34:20.520 --> 34:21.554
Fire.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.074
They've launched the weapon.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.589
It will reach the atmosphere
in 12 seconds.

34:32.719 --> 34:33.835
Malcolm.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.399
Hard about.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.916
Direct hit to the Armoury.
We've lost hull plating.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.349
-Torpedo launchers.
-What about phase-cannons?

35:11.480 --> 35:14.711
-The aft cannon's online, just barely.
-Lock onto their Bridge.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.398
-No!
-Stand aside, Doctor.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.511
Their Bridge is protected
with dispersive armour.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.835
Your weapons will never penetrate it.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.191
Target your cannons here...

35:23.320 --> 35:25.959
-behind their sensor array.
-What good will that do?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.877
Their main plasma junction's
located there.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.833
A direct hit would disable
their entire power grid.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.873
Trust me.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.229
Do what he says. Fire when ready.

35:53.960 --> 35:57.270
-They're disabled.
-Are they still alive?

35:59.080 --> 36:00.957
I'm reading 12 bio-signs.

36:22.960 --> 36:26.077
Captain, there's a power surge
in their reactor.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.636
He's overloading his dilithium matrix.
He'll destroy the ship.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.239
Let me talk to him.

36:41.480 --> 36:42.595
Malik.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.193
Malik, it's Father. Don't do this.

36:47.560 --> 36:50.552
Some of your brothers and sisters
are still alive.

36:50.680 --> 36:53.240
Would you rather
they went to prison with you?

36:54.040 --> 36:57.510
-The embryos.
-There's no place for us on Earth...

36:58.520 --> 37:00.112
or anywhere else.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.556
-Better to die here.
-Please, please!

37:05.760 --> 37:07.557
I'll see you soon.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.514
Malik!

37:12.520 --> 37:13.475
Sir.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.751
I'll contact Starfleet on your behalf.

37:33.880 --> 37:37.555
-Let them know that you helped us.
-I can't believe they're gone.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.354
All of them.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.592
We're heading the wrong way.

37:42.720 --> 37:46.076
You're not going to the Brig,
I'm taking you to crew quarters.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.793
You're alive.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.915
You betrayed us all.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.715
Goodbye, Father.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.349
Captain's Starlog, May 27th, 2154.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.232
Our actions at the Klingon colony...

38:29.360 --> 38:31.476
appear to have satisfied
the High Council.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.751
They've called off their plans
to retaliate against Earth.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.953
You could at least let me finish
my work before you take it away...

38:50.080 --> 38:51.274
and destroy it.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.837
No one's destroyed anything.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.754
It's being stored in a secure location.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.272
Maybe someday...

39:02.080 --> 39:05.231
we'll figure out how to use it
to benefit humanity.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.791
I wouldn't count on it.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.879
I've been thinking.

39:22.520 --> 39:26.593
Perfecting humanity
may not be possible.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.999
Cybernetics.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.795
Artificial life-forms.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.798
Goodbye, Doctor.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.829
I doubt I'll finish the work myself.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.595
Might take a generation or two.
