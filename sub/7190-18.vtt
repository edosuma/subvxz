00:25.150 --> 00:26.943
You're not green enough for me.

00:27.026 --> 00:28.987

00:29.070 --> 00:30.405
- Coach Desdemona's idea.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.031
She thought we should act like
we're in love

00:32.115 --> 00:34.200

- Really?

00:34.284 --> 00:36.578
That's a terrible idea.

to any of my texts?

00:39.831 --> 00:42.375

No.

to quit the Sharks

00:52.093 --> 00:54.220

a love spell on Emma

01:19.120 --> 01:20.497

01:20.580 --> 01:21.915

01:29.380 --> 01:32.801

she wants him back.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.488
- Why are you here?

09:32.572 --> 09:36.701
- Because I just ran
into Katie at The Seven.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.953
And she's all alone
thinking she has no friends.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.496
- Yeah, well, we've been trying
to get her here,

09:40.579 --> 09:42.415
but she won't answer her phone.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.124
This party is for her.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.751
- And Daniel.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.087
- Oh, yes, and Daniel.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.340
FYI, we're back together.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.258
- No, you're not!
No, they're not.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.844
- Oh, Maddie Winky.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.512
Oh, that's wonderful.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.974
Now, normally I don't
really like the recycling.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.186
But in this case, I love it.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.981
- No, I'm his girlfriend!

10:07.064 --> 10:08.274
Costars that start dating
and fall in love--

10:08.357 --> 10:09.734
it's a classic story.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.610
- So is exes who realize
they're meant to be

10:11.694 --> 10:14.739
and get back together
for the...

10:14.822 --> 10:16.157
87th time.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.659
- Okay, ladies, can we get
back to your friend, please?

10:18.743 --> 10:21.579
Because Katie is all
alone at The Seven.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.248
You say this party is for her,
and she's there by herself,

10:24.332 --> 10:27.835
looking a little like
Dracula's long-lost daughter.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.919
- She's goth.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.588
- Like you.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.214
- [chuckles]
Like me.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.342
What are you talking about?

10:40.389 --> 10:42.933
Aah!

10:43.017 --> 10:45.853
Aah!

10:45.936 --> 10:48.064
Aah!

10:48.147 --> 10:48.856
Aah!

10:52.068 --> 10:54.653
- [sighs] I'm gonna
go find Daniel.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.408
- Listen, Maddie,
I don't know what's going on,

10:59.492 --> 11:02.119
even though it seems like
some magic-related fiasco

11:02.203 --> 11:04.038
that's making you
crazier than usual--

11:04.121 --> 11:06.248
- It's true love
that knows no bounds.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.542
- This isn't
about you and Daniel.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.251
It's about Katie.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.087
She's your best friend.

11:11.170 --> 11:15.216
- I'm sorry, Diego, but Daniel
and I are just meant to be.

11:15.299 --> 11:19.345
- Listen, Maddie, I don't know
what spell you're under,

11:19.428 --> 11:23.974
but there's no spell
stronger than friendship.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.976
Katie is and...

11:26.060 --> 11:29.271
always will be
your best friend.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.607
She needs you.

11:31.690 --> 11:32.358
- You're right.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.486
We have to go get her.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.947
Come on, Soph, let's go.
We have to go get Katie.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.241
- But I think I just
caught Daniel's scent.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.867
[sniffing]
- [sighs]

11:45.704 --> 11:47.123
- Daniel, there you are.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.458
- Oh, no, not you, too.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.210
- Not "me too" what?

11:51.293 --> 11:53.129
- [sighs]
I thought you were, um...

11:53.212 --> 11:54.463
Never mind.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.090
- You thought we were pals

11:56.173 --> 11:58.592
who finally realized they want
to be more than just pals?

11:58.676 --> 12:01.303
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

12:01.387 --> 12:03.180
We're gonna
have so much fun together.

12:03.264 --> 12:03.973
What do you want to do first?

12:04.056 --> 12:06.934
Jet skiing, bungee jumping?

12:07.017 --> 12:08.269
BASE jumping!

12:08.352 --> 12:09.770
- No, I--

12:09.854 --> 12:11.522
Yeah, BASE jumping.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.482
Let's do it.
- Really?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.526
Oh, I knew you weren't
afraid of everything.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.028
- Go get your gear
and meet me at the tiki bar.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.405
- Okay.

12:19.488 --> 12:20.823
- Hey, Andi?
- Yeah?

12:20.906 --> 12:23.951
- Um, don't tell
anyone that I'm here.

12:24.034 --> 12:24.910
It'll be our little secret.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.042
This is way past
out of control.

12:36.338 --> 12:36.922
- There you are!

12:39.383 --> 12:41.886
- Yeah, I've been here all day.
So what?

12:41.969 --> 12:44.889
- So you have to come
to the beach.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.348
- I hate the beach.
- No, you don't.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.893
You love the beach.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.311
- The old me loved the beach.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.522
The new me stays away from light
sources as much as possible.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.940
- Look, I don't know
what's gotten into you--

12:55.024 --> 12:57.193
- I'll tell you
what's gotten into me.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.236
You guys ignoring me all week

12:59.320 --> 13:00.279
because you have
more important things to do

13:00.362 --> 13:01.363
than hang out
with your BFF Katie.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.657
- More important things

13:03.741 --> 13:06.035
like planning
your surprise birthday party.

13:06.118 --> 13:06.994
- My what?

13:07.077 --> 13:07.536
- Oh, that's my cue.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.580
[clears throat]

13:09.663 --> 13:13.042
I bet you feel pretty foolish
right about now,

13:13.125 --> 13:13.584
don't you?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.503
How was that?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.465
- Well, don't you feel
pretty foolish?

13:19.548 --> 13:22.676
- Yeah.
Yes, I do.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.261
- We could never forget
your birthday.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.972
- Thanks, guys.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.390
[all giggling]

13:28.474 --> 13:30.851
- Oh, I can't wait to
get out of these clothes.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.311
[all giggle]

13:36.440 --> 13:38.651
- You coming?

13:38.734 --> 13:41.070
- So I can watch you go gaga
over Daniel again?

13:41.153 --> 13:41.904
[scoffs]
I'll pass.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.949
- I'm not gaga over Daniel.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.535
- Then who are you gaga over?

13:49.537 --> 13:50.788
Who are you gaga over?

13:53.332 --> 13:55.251
- "Team Daniel"?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.628
What?

14:01.465 --> 14:03.092
- Have you seen my parachute?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.094
- What?
No.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.054
And you brought
your parachute to the beach?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.890
- Of course I did.
Do you not know me at all?

14:15.813 --> 14:16.689
- Hey, Andi?
- What?

14:16.772 --> 14:19.441
- [whispering]
No, no, no.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.736
- I think I saw your parachute
over by the tiki bar

14:22.820 --> 14:24.989
in your other bag.

14:25.072 --> 14:25.656
I'll go get it for you.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.908
- Oh, great, thanks.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.785
Oh, can you get me
some sunblock, too?

14:29.868 --> 14:32.204
Daniel burns easily.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.539
- What's wrong?

14:33.622 --> 14:35.666
- Emma?
- Yeah?

14:35.749 --> 14:38.586
- You're not in love with me!

14:38.669 --> 14:40.921
- Gee, don't sound
so excited about it.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.799
- No, that's not what I meant.

14:43.882 --> 14:47.553
What I mean is,
all these girls are after me.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.222
- [sighs] If you're trying
to make me jealous, it's--

14:50.306 --> 14:51.640
- No.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.058
I don't know what's going on.

14:53.142 --> 14:57.146
Maddie, Sophie, Gigi, Andi, that
weird girl from physics class,

14:57.229 --> 14:58.522

working the snack bar--

14:58.606 --> 15:01.650
they're all chasing me.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.067
- What?

15:04.236 --> 15:06.864
- I-I--it's like somebody
put a spell on me.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.867
- Oh!

15:09.950 --> 15:12.995
That's why those girls were
wearing "Team Daniel" shirts.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.330
- They have shirts?

15:14.413 --> 15:16.206
- Who would put
that spell on you?

15:16.290 --> 15:17.499
- I don't know.
Jax?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.126
- It wasn't Jax.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.920
He doesn't have his
powers anymore, remember?

15:22.004 --> 15:24.048
- Right, right, sorry.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.841
Well, if it is a spell,

15:25.924 --> 15:27.301
it has to be broken
before something--

15:27.384 --> 15:28.636
- There you are.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.679
Our selfie is going viral.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.432
We need to take more.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.683
Does that face say,

15:34.767 --> 15:38.562
"I am so in love with Gigi,"

15:38.646 --> 15:39.813
or what?

15:39.897 --> 15:43.734
[girls screaming]

15:51.033 --> 15:52.409
- Hey, there you are.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.412
I thought that maybe you'd
forgotten where we were sitting.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.331
- No, I-I just need
to find Andi's goggles.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.583
- What for?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.252
- I think someone cast
a bad spell on Daniel.

16:02.336 --> 16:02.795
- [laughs]
Nice.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.422
I mean, so what?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.132
- So he needs help.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.550
- He can figure
it out for himself.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.843
- No, he can't.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.929
He doesn't have powers
to reverse the spell.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.055
- [sighs]
What spell is it?

16:13.138 --> 16:16.975
- It makes all the girls
obsessed with him.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.477
- It's not a bad spell.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.354
That's an awesome spell.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.772
I mean--I mean,
not that I'd want to be

16:21.855 --> 16:24.274

is a zombie on a video game?

20:22.554 --> 20:24.473
- Okay, look, his image
might be virtual,

20:24.556 --> 20:25.891
but his feelings are real.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.768
- Oh, I got to tell
Miss Information about this.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.937
- What?
No!

20:30.020 --> 20:31.271
- Why did you have to do that?

20:33.815 --> 20:36.151
Hey, I'm sorry.

20:36.234 --> 20:38.445
I didn't know he was going
to make fun of Phillip.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.864
- I worked really hard
to hack that game.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.450
- You did.
Months.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.536
- And you know none of the guys
we know are my type at all.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.829
- I know.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.498
None of them
could keep up with you.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.667
- Exactly, but Phillip can.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.502
I mean, he can do--
- Hey, Andi!

20:53.585 --> 20:56.296
I've got your zombie boyfriend
stuck in the farmhouse,

20:56.380 --> 20:57.673
and I'm about
to go mental on him!

20:57.756 --> 20:59.091
Ha ha!
- What?

21:02.594 --> 21:04.012
Jax, you better not hurt him.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.764
JAX:
Oh, relax, he's fine.

21:05.847 --> 21:06.807
I was just kidding.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.308
He's just--

21:08.392 --> 21:08.850
Uh-oh.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.560
- What uh-oh?

21:10.644 --> 21:13.355
- I-I don't know.
M-my controller's stuck.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.732
I can't swap out
my zombie blaster.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.694
- No, that'll get rid of all
the zombies on the screen.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.654
- Jax, open the door!
- No!

21:20.737 --> 21:21.530
Look, if you let go
of the controller,

21:21.613 --> 21:23.490
it'll make the bomb go off.

21:23.573 --> 21:24.616
- What do I do?

21:24.700 --> 21:25.367
I can't keep
pressing the button.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.910
My hand's cramping up.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.954
ANDI:
Do something.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.416
- We need to save him from doom,
bring Phillip to my room.
