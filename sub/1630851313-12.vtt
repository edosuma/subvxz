11:34.361 --> 11:37.253
What kind of mom does that?

11:37.272 --> 11:39.698
Um...

11:39.925 --> 11:41.866
The-the week before

11:42.093 --> 11:46.187
I met you, I was
finishing up a 28-day

11:46.206 --> 11:49.098
court-mandated rehab program.

11:49.117 --> 11:50.950
I got a DUI.

11:51.102 --> 11:52.952
Um...

11:53.104 --> 11:55.714
My-my-my son

11:55.865 --> 11:57.382
was in the backseat.

11:57.492 --> 12:00.126
I-I swear, I swear I never

12:00.220 --> 12:02.721
meant to put him in any danger.

12:02.872 --> 12:05.080
I...

12:05.133 --> 12:06.707
I was just so

12:06.727 --> 12:08.634
overwhelmed and...

12:08.729 --> 12:10.377
You were self-medicating.

12:10.455 --> 12:12.138
That doesn't make you
a bad person.

12:12.290 --> 12:14.290
It's the only way
I know how to deal

12:14.309 --> 12:16.151
when things get hard.

12:17.295 --> 12:20.221
Now, my-my ex
won't let me see my son.

12:20.298 --> 12:22.298
I have to prove... (chuckles)

12:22.317 --> 12:25.651
that I am not a danger anymore.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.972
I miss him so much.

12:28.990 --> 12:31.750
Maddie,

12:31.977 --> 12:34.660
please stay. Please.

12:34.813 --> 12:36.479
I... (sighs)

12:36.498 --> 12:40.717
I think you're probably the only
friend I have right now.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.911
No one else,

12:43.930 --> 12:46.489
no one else knows
what this is like.

12:46.582 --> 12:49.842
I just want to get better
for her.

12:49.995 --> 12:52.103
I know, I know, and we...

12:52.255 --> 12:53.997
we can help each other. Okay?

12:54.090 --> 12:57.258
-Get better together.
-Okay.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.851
Then we both go home.

12:59.004 --> 13:00.837

19:10.316 --> 19:11.983

19:34.248 --> 19:35.989

-JOE: No.

19:40.329 --> 19:41.570
He's not the healthiest guy,
but I never

19:41.589 --> 19:43.014
heard him mention
anything about diabetes.

19:43.165 --> 19:44.665
Um, he has had a cough
for a while.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.475
Cough.

19:50.839 --> 19:52.264
Getting a crackling sound.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.508
Sounds like serious lung damage.
Is he a smoker?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.085
Not Murray.
He never touched them.

19:56.103 --> 19:57.344
Maybe pulmonary fibrosis,

19:57.363 --> 19:58.845
but what would cause him
to go down now?

19:58.865 --> 19:59.939
Are you for real asking me?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.014
Because our volunteer training

20:01.034 --> 20:02.107
didn't go that in depth.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.351

20:04.370 --> 20:06.370

I called the paramedics.

20:06.522 --> 20:08.873

our tent is across the street.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.358

-Okay.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.452
Looks like he's coming around.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.046
Welcome back, Murray.
Let's figure out

20:15.273 --> 20:16.380
what's going on with your lungs.

20:16.532 --> 20:19.032
-Bagpipe lung.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,

20:21.128 --> 20:23.203
if you're looking
for the medical term.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.114
Happens to people
who play wind instruments,

20:25.207 --> 20:26.682
and also bagpipes.

20:28.377 --> 20:31.287
W-What are you doing?
You're gonna ruin his bagpipes.

20:31.305 --> 20:32.638
Yeah. Pretty sure
they're already ruined.

20:32.790 --> 20:36.067
I'm gonna need a biohazard bag.
These are full of mold.

20:36.218 --> 20:37.401
You've been inhaling this
for God knows how long.

20:37.553 --> 20:39.570
It's wreaked havoc
on your lungs.

20:39.722 --> 20:41.221
When was the last time
you cleaned those things?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.723
Never.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.057
That'll do it.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.226
You're lucky. If you kept going,

20:46.320 --> 20:47.561
these bagpipes
would've killed you.

20:47.655 --> 20:50.248
They're gonna do X-rays
and bloodwork

20:50.399 --> 20:53.251
at the hospital,
probably put you on

20:53.327 --> 20:56.420
corticosteroids to reverse
the damage.

What do you mean
you're a volunteer?

21:10.177 --> 21:12.495
Boston Medical Volunteer Corps.

21:12.513 --> 21:14.179
It's mostly handing out
Band-Aids and

21:14.332 --> 21:16.256
<i> bottles of water</i>
<i> to drunk people.</i>

21:16.425 --> 21:17.924
There have been
a few doozies, though.

21:18.019 --> 21:19.335
You ever hear of bagpipe lung?

21:19.353 --> 21:21.279
Well, it sounds like
you're really settling in

21:21.506 --> 21:22.671
to life in Boston.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.448
<i> Honestly, I really signed up</i>
<i> to keep busy.</i>

21:24.600 --> 21:26.675
Just wish it really
kept me paid, too.

21:26.727 --> 21:29.345
My savings account balance
is getting pretty low.

21:29.363 --> 21:33.349
<i>Well, you still have a full-time</i>
<i> job waiting for you here.</i>

21:33.351 --> 21:34.350
<i> Chim?</i>

21:34.443 --> 21:36.685
People are starting
to ask questions.

21:36.704 --> 21:38.537
<i> My answer is still</i>
<i> the same, Bobby.</i>

21:38.631 --> 21:40.298
-I'm not coming home
without Maddie.
-(man whoops, glass shatters)

21:40.449 --> 21:42.616
All right, I got to go.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.136
(line beeps)

21:45.363 --> 21:47.013
(sighs)

21:48.165 --> 21:49.865
<i> MADDIE:</i>
<i> When I came here, I didn't</i>

21:49.958 --> 21:51.884
know what to expect.

21:51.960 --> 21:52.977
I felt so many

21:53.128 --> 21:54.145
terrible things about myself,

21:54.296 --> 21:56.889
I thought
everyone else would, too.

21:57.041 --> 21:58.131
Then, when I got here,

21:58.151 --> 22:01.710
um, I realized
I wasn't crazy or...

22:01.729 --> 22:03.612
alone.

22:04.882 --> 22:06.657
You guys healed me.

22:06.809 --> 22:08.308
You made me feel stronger,

22:08.328 --> 22:10.328
and I finally feel like
I'm ready to go home.

22:10.479 --> 22:13.497
So, I just wanted to say
thank you to all of you.

22:13.724 --> 22:16.292
I'm very grateful.
Es-Especially you, Kira.

22:17.986 --> 22:20.671
Oh, special shout-out.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.414
(laughs)

22:22.567 --> 22:24.324
Lucky me.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.011
You were there
when I needed a friend.

22:27.238 --> 22:28.829
I couldn't have
done this without you.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.240
Hmm. Okay, let's all,

22:31.258 --> 22:34.501
let's all give her
a round of applause.

22:34.595 --> 22:38.522
(sighs) I'm so glad
that you are fixed.

22:38.674 --> 22:40.416
VAL:
I don't think that's what
Maddie's saying, Kira.

22:40.509 --> 22:42.918
None of us have it figured out.
If we did,

22:42.937 --> 22:45.087
-we wouldn't be here.
-Whatever.

22:45.180 --> 22:48.774
I am so happy for you.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.442
Okay? But, too bad

22:50.595 --> 22:53.412
for the rest of us who still
have problems. (laughs)

22:54.523 --> 22:55.539
VAL:
(sighs) That's it, everyone.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.525
Have a great afternoon.
I'll see you next time.

22:58.619 --> 23:01.337
(quiet chatter)

23:06.219 --> 23:07.367
(sighs, clears throat)

23:07.461 --> 23:08.944
Hey, Kira, wait a second.
What was that?

23:08.963 --> 23:11.130
I'm really not in the mood

23:11.282 --> 23:12.890
-for a lecture.
-Okay, that's fine.

23:12.967 --> 23:14.100
I just wanted to check on you

23:14.209 --> 23:15.208
'cause you don't seem
like yourself.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.136
Mm. Maybe it's the depression.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.546
Maybe it's the whiskey. (sniffs)

23:19.565 --> 23:20.305
You're drunk.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.049
What do you care? (laughs)

23:23.218 --> 23:24.627
You're leaving.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.313
My only support system's
just hightailing it out of here.

23:29.634 --> 23:33.226
I came here to get well
and to go home to my family.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.579
That was the plan,
for both of us.

23:35.806 --> 23:37.564
(scoffs)

23:37.583 --> 23:41.252
I've messed up too badly.
(chuckles, sniffles)

23:41.403 --> 23:43.254
I don't deserve to be a mom.

23:43.481 --> 23:46.090
Okay, you know what? I told
myself exactly that same thing

23:46.241 --> 23:49.075
six months ago, and I was wrong.

23:49.170 --> 23:50.744
I got better.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.929
You can, too.

23:52.080 --> 23:55.340
Not by this afternoon.

23:55.509 --> 23:56.583
Ugh.

23:56.677 --> 23:58.936
I have a supervised visitation.

23:59.087 --> 24:00.345
No, no, no. You can't, you can't

24:00.498 --> 24:02.255
-show up like this.
-I can't not show up.

24:02.349 --> 24:03.832
Okay, what time
is the appointment?

24:03.926 --> 24:06.694
Um... 3:00.

24:08.189 --> 24:10.531
Come on, I have an idea.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.269
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

24:16.363 --> 24:19.181
I-I-I cannot be admitted. No.
If my ex finds out,

24:19.200 --> 24:20.791
I won't be able to see my son.
I'm sorry...

24:21.018 --> 24:22.108
Okay, I'm not admitting you.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.035
I'm not admitting you.
I'm helping you.

24:23.187 --> 24:25.354
(sighs) Sit right here.

24:25.447 --> 24:27.798
I'm gonna get you a banana bag.
It'll sober you up.

24:27.984 --> 24:29.525
I'll be right back.

24:29.543 --> 24:31.552
Maddie?

24:33.030 --> 24:35.639
Why is your face
on the bulletin board?

24:44.650 --> 24:46.358
What?

24:48.804 --> 24:50.321
That's you.

24:50.472 --> 24:52.973
Oh, my God,
he's still looking for me.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.493
I thought you said he hated you.

24:56.979 --> 24:58.704
You lied.

24:59.982 --> 25:02.241
-I didn't lie.
-All this time,

25:02.393 --> 25:05.077
I thought that we were
in the same boat.

25:05.229 --> 25:07.153
Being punished by our exes.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.656
Not being able
to-to see our kids.

25:09.750 --> 25:13.235
But you could've
gone back any time, right?

25:13.254 --> 25:16.847
I'm fighting like hell
to see my son,

25:17.074 --> 25:18.257
and you left them.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.517
I had to.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.502
Okay? It was dangerous
for her and for me, and I...

25:22.522 --> 25:25.748
I needed to get help
and to get better.

25:25.841 --> 25:29.752
Congratulations, Maddie.

25:29.754 --> 25:31.445
You're better.

25:37.094 --> 25:39.370
You don't need me anymore.

25:41.023 --> 25:42.873
MADDIE:
Kira!

25:43.100 --> 25:45.768
Excuse me. Sorry.

25:45.861 --> 25:47.169
Sorry.

26:02.377 --> 26:04.645
-(crowd cheering)
-(drums playing)

26:06.640 --> 26:08.649
(bagpipes playing)

26:24.083 --> 26:26.083
(firetruck horn honks)

26:26.234 --> 26:30.495
Snake bite. Looks like
localized tissue damage.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.090
Let's immobilize his hand
and elevate it above his heart.

26:33.241 --> 26:35.408
Don't want it to swell
more than it is.

26:35.577 --> 26:36.652
Oh, no.

26:36.745 --> 26:39.338
The venom's making
my heart swell.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.173
Oh, I'm gonna die.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.300
No, I meant your hand,
and statistically speaking,

26:43.527 --> 26:44.843
people don't die
from snake bites.

26:44.995 --> 26:46.178
Stupidity,

26:46.272 --> 26:47.754
-that's another story.
-RANDALL: So, that's it?

26:47.773 --> 26:49.348
What about a tourniquet?
Or maybe

26:49.500 --> 26:51.166
we can cut it
and suck out the poison?

26:51.259 --> 26:53.277
That is exactly what you're
not supposed to do.

26:53.504 --> 26:55.170
-Antivenom is his best bet.
-Oh, it stings!

26:55.263 --> 26:57.189
And I don't know about you,
but I'm not packing any.

26:57.265 --> 26:58.190
That's not a bad idea.

26:58.266 --> 26:59.508
We should ask for that.

26:59.526 --> 27:01.510
Every year,
there's always some asshat

27:01.528 --> 27:03.862
dressed as St. Patrick
pretending to drive the snakes

27:04.014 --> 27:05.514
out of Ireland.

27:05.532 --> 27:07.607
And I thought Cinco de Mayo
in Los Angeles was crazy.

27:07.627 --> 27:11.036
-(bagpipes playing)
-(people whooping)

27:11.188 --> 27:13.538
Hey. Kira, it's Maddie.

27:13.691 --> 27:14.873
Um, just, please,

27:15.025 --> 27:16.525
call me, okay? I...

27:16.618 --> 27:18.552
Just want to make sure
you're all right.

27:20.622 --> 27:22.956
-Thank you.
-MADDIE: Sir,
I'm looking for a woman.

27:23.050 --> 27:24.141
She's late 30s. Blonde.

27:24.368 --> 27:25.200
About this tall
and probably drunk.

27:25.293 --> 27:26.644
Oh, a drunk woman.

27:26.795 --> 27:27.961
That narrows it down.

27:28.130 --> 27:30.564
You know it's
St. Patrick's Day, right?

27:32.318 --> 27:34.393
Lean forward a bit for me.
There you go.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.061
-If you could hold that, please.
-Nothing's broken.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.213
Looks like he's all yours.

27:38.232 --> 27:39.973
OFFICER:
Thanks. Let's go.

27:40.067 --> 27:42.976
So this guy tried to
rob a bank with a stick?

27:42.995 --> 27:46.388
Uh, technically
it's a shillelagh.

27:46.407 --> 27:48.724
-And a rubber one at that.
-What were you thinking?

27:48.817 --> 27:51.076
She stole me pot o' gold.

27:51.228 --> 27:54.579
You know you're not actually
a leprechaun, right?

27:54.732 --> 27:55.822
(laughs)

27:55.841 --> 27:57.399
Hey, Kira, call me.

27:57.492 --> 27:59.159
I'm really worried about you.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.586
Hey, I'm gonna go grab a lobster
roll from the food truck.

28:01.739 --> 28:03.180
-You want anything?
-Sure.

28:03.331 --> 28:04.515
Just make sure there's
no mayo on it.

28:04.666 --> 28:07.759
I sense you have no idea
what a lobster roll is.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.019
Just grab him one anyway.

28:09.171 --> 28:11.021
Three lobster rolls
coming up.

28:11.173 --> 28:14.674
So how is it?
Being of service again.

28:14.694 --> 28:18.696
Honestly, it's the best
I've felt in probably a year.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.030
(line rings)

28:20.257 --> 28:22.408
(siren whoops)

28:23.928 --> 28:26.595
Get in the car.

28:26.764 --> 28:27.520
(people screaming)

28:27.614 --> 28:29.448
-Hey, watch it.
-(shattering)

28:29.600 --> 28:31.433
Come on.

28:31.452 --> 28:33.711
-(body thuds)
-MAN: Whoa. Is he all right?

28:33.862 --> 28:35.954
WOMAN:
Look at this.

28:36.106 --> 28:37.940
CHIMNEY:
Is that an axe?

28:38.033 --> 28:39.550
MAN:
You gotta see this.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.778
MAN:
Gabe. Gabe!

28:42.796 --> 28:44.704
Oh, my God, Gabe!

28:44.724 --> 28:46.206
You did this?

28:46.225 --> 28:47.632
We were axe throwing,
and he stumbled in front of me,

28:47.785 --> 28:50.060
and I-I hit him
instead of the target.

28:50.287 --> 28:51.470
No pulse. He's not breathing.

28:51.622 --> 28:52.804
I'd say start
compressions, but...

28:52.898 --> 28:55.182
There's an axe in his head?

28:55.234 --> 28:57.309
Randall, that sandwich board,
bring it over here!

28:57.403 --> 28:59.294
ELI:
Okay. Okay, let's get him into
a seated position.

28:59.313 --> 29:01.196
CHIMNEY:
I got his head.

29:03.650 --> 29:05.225
-What do I do?
-Randall, put the board
behind him.

29:05.319 --> 29:06.910
Eli will hold him up
while I do compressions.

29:07.062 --> 29:08.912
-What do I do?
-Okay, hold his head,

29:09.064 --> 29:09.913
keep his airway clear.

29:09.990 --> 29:10.914
I can do that without

29:11.066 --> 29:12.750
looking at his head, right?

29:12.977 --> 29:14.209
Howie, on your count.

29:18.148 --> 29:19.757
Feels like old times,
doesn't it?

29:20.651 --> 29:22.760
Well, nobody's puked on me yet.

29:22.987 --> 29:24.261
(Randall gags)

29:24.488 --> 29:27.264
-Oh, God.
-That is not an invitation,
Randall.

29:27.916 --> 29:29.767
Pulse check.

29:29.994 --> 29:31.268
Pulse is back. We got him.

29:31.495 --> 29:33.270
Dispatch,
this is Paramedic Cobb.

29:33.421 --> 29:36.214
About to transport a young male
with an axe in his head

29:36.366 --> 29:38.183
to Mercy Shore Hospital.

29:38.260 --> 29:39.518
Okay, let's secure it
and move him.

29:39.612 --> 29:40.836
What can I do?

29:40.929 --> 29:42.095
You can take up chess.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.782
-Oh!
-Sorry.

29:44.933 --> 29:47.025
I hate this day.

29:47.102 --> 29:50.012
(phone ringing)

29:50.030 --> 29:51.530
-Ah, Kira?
<i> -MAN: No.</i>

29:51.682 --> 29:53.849
<i> This is the bartender</i>
<i> down at Father Sean's Pub.</i>

29:53.851 --> 29:57.461
<i> -I think your friend</i>
<i> needs some help.</i>
-Okay.

30:03.285 --> 30:07.137
Hey. Our axe man's
heading into surgery.

30:07.289 --> 30:10.215
Okay, great.
Oh, my shift's over.

30:10.367 --> 30:12.868
I should get back, maybe,
and turn in this vest.

30:12.886 --> 30:15.795
-Oh, ride in the rig with me.
I'll drop you off.
-You sure?

30:15.964 --> 30:17.097
What if another call comes in?

30:17.149 --> 30:19.149
I'll let you use
the lights and sirens.

30:19.301 --> 30:21.710
(music playing in distance)

30:21.879 --> 30:23.636
(gagging)

30:23.656 --> 30:25.730
Oh, God, she's puking.

30:25.899 --> 30:26.990
No. No, she's aspirating.

30:27.217 --> 30:28.808
Come on, we've got to
get her on her side.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.218
Kira?! Call 911.

30:30.237 --> 30:32.237
MAN:
All right.

30:32.981 --> 30:34.814
(phone dials, line rings)

30:34.834 --> 30:36.558
<i> -OPERATOR: 911.</i>
-Yes, I'm calling from
Father Sean's Pub.

30:36.651 --> 30:38.484
Kira, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.744
MAN: We have a young woman
here who needs help.

30:39.897 --> 30:41.580
-We think she
might be aspirating.
-Wake up.

30:41.707 --> 30:44.007
Good. Good! There's a unit
just down the block.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.992
-Good. Wave 'em down.
-Okay.

30:46.086 --> 30:47.419
Kira, come on, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

30:47.571 --> 30:48.846
-Come on, Kira, wake up!
-Over here!

30:49.014 --> 30:50.755
-Come on.
-MAN: Hey!

30:50.850 --> 30:52.257
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.
-Kira, wake up.

30:52.409 --> 30:53.833
-Over here.
-(siren wailing)

30:53.969 --> 30:55.168
MAN:
She's here. Come on!

30:55.187 --> 30:56.520
MADDIE:
Oh, my God, hurry.

30:56.689 --> 30:59.005
MAN:
Over here. Over here.
She's right here.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.083
-Come on. She's right here.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
What do we got?

31:01.101 --> 31:03.268
She's 38 years old.
Alcohol poisoning.

31:03.345 --> 31:05.253
She's aspirated vomit.
She's unresponsive.

31:05.347 --> 31:07.364
-ELI: How long has she been out?
-MADDIE: I don't know.

31:07.591 --> 31:09.349
I did a sternal rub
but she's not coming to.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.684
-Is she on anything?
-Prescriptions for
antidepressants.

31:11.704 --> 31:15.205
-Any other drugs?
Illegal substances?
-I don't know.

31:15.357 --> 31:19.209
CHIMNEY:
Pardon me. Make a hole!
Coming through.

31:22.697 --> 31:24.381
Maddie?

31:26.627 --> 31:27.718
Howie.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.729
We have acute alcohol
intoxication,

31:38.898 --> 31:41.139
heart rate severely low.

31:41.216 --> 31:43.458
BP 80/60 and she's cold
to the touch.

31:43.551 --> 31:46.361
-Let's start suction
and get her on a gurney.
-Copy that.

31:48.966 --> 31:50.223
You okay?

31:50.317 --> 31:52.910
Y-Yeah.
Is Jee with you?

31:53.061 --> 31:54.986
She's fine.

31:55.139 --> 31:56.154
She's staying with a friend

31:56.323 --> 31:58.156
while I play paramedic again.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.584
All right, suction's ready.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.410
38-year-old female
with acute alcohol poisoning,

32:10.429 --> 32:12.578
unresponsive on the scene
after aspirating vomit.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.490
Administered fluid and bolused
one liter of LR.

32:15.509 --> 32:17.993
Used mechanical suction
to clear airway.

32:18.086 --> 32:20.312
Vitals are stable.

32:22.257 --> 32:24.274
(sighs)
I think she'll be okay.

32:24.426 --> 32:26.334
It's a good thing
you found her in time.

32:26.353 --> 32:29.020
I'm, uh, I'm Eli, by the way.

32:29.173 --> 32:30.689
We were never formally
introduced.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.858
-Maddie.
I've heard a lot about you.
-Same.

32:34.011 --> 32:35.177
You and that little girl
are about

32:35.195 --> 32:37.679
all he talks about these days.

32:37.698 --> 32:39.848
Where is he?

32:39.850 --> 32:41.274
Uh, probably outside.

32:41.368 --> 32:42.775
I think he needed a minute.

32:42.795 --> 32:45.170
Me, too.

32:46.356 --> 32:49.299
(sighs)
How is he... really?

32:49.451 --> 32:51.193
I mean, I know that I could
ask him myself.

32:51.211 --> 32:53.345
But he'd probably
sugarcoat it for you?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.880
When he showed up,
he was a mess.

32:56.033 --> 32:57.457
He was worried about you.

32:57.551 --> 33:01.228
He was worried about Jee-Yun,
and he was racked with guilt.

33:02.372 --> 33:04.147
Guilt? I'm the one
that left.

33:04.374 --> 33:07.526
Yeah, but he's the one
that feels responsible.

33:10.230 --> 33:12.972
Eli said you would be here.

33:13.066 --> 33:15.242
He was right.

33:15.902 --> 33:17.143
He usually is.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.555
It's one of his
more annoying traits.

33:20.574 --> 33:24.001
But actually,
this time he was wrong.

33:24.228 --> 33:26.911
You see, all those days
that I spent sitting

33:27.064 --> 33:28.396
right here on this bench
convinced

33:28.415 --> 33:30.656
you would walk out those doors,

33:30.676 --> 33:32.009
he said I was crazy.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.252
And here you are.

33:34.329 --> 33:36.921
I know that you must have
a lot of questions.

33:37.074 --> 33:38.348
I know why you left, Maddie.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.592
Still not sure why
you stayed away.

33:40.744 --> 33:42.335
Because I didn't think
I'd ever get better.

33:42.429 --> 33:45.171
And it didn't feel safe
to be around any of you.

33:45.265 --> 33:47.766
What happened with Jee-Yun
and the bathtub,

33:47.860 --> 33:49.084
that was an accident.

33:49.177 --> 33:51.611
But trying to kill myself
wasn't.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.242
You what?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.612
When I dropped her off
at the firehouse I thought

34:00.764 --> 34:04.124
that's it, she's safe.

34:06.953 --> 34:11.790
So I drove up the coast,
I found a beach,

34:11.884 --> 34:14.468
and I walked into the ocean.

34:16.538 --> 34:18.463
My head was so full of
all the mistakes

34:18.557 --> 34:20.131
I had made in my life,
and I just thought

34:20.300 --> 34:22.684
everybody would be
better off without me.

34:23.954 --> 34:26.788
Sad at first, yeah.

34:26.807 --> 34:28.506
But that would fade.

34:29.476 --> 34:31.142
And Jee, she's so young,
she wouldn't even

34:31.236 --> 34:33.219
remember me as her mommy.

34:33.313 --> 34:35.655
How could you even think that?

34:39.970 --> 34:41.653
Maddie, if you died,
I would never...

34:41.805 --> 34:43.538
Never forgive yourself.

34:46.977 --> 34:49.669
I got out of the ocean for you.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.072
For both of you.

34:54.242 --> 34:59.638
But I had to stay here
to learn to stop running.

35:01.158 --> 35:02.599
Maddie...

35:04.161 --> 35:06.344
I would have done anything
to help you.

35:06.496 --> 35:09.664
I beat myself up every day
that I didn't do more.

35:09.683 --> 35:14.194
I'm so sorry for everything
that I put you through.

35:15.263 --> 35:17.781
I'm sorry that
I wasn't there for you.

35:17.932 --> 35:21.100
-You were there.
-Not enough.

35:21.194 --> 35:24.028
I blame myself for you leaving,

35:24.123 --> 35:26.498
for missing the warning signs.

35:28.702 --> 35:30.961
Or maybe ignoring them.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.549
I just wanted so badly
for you to be okay, I just...

35:37.210 --> 35:40.137
I pretended that you were okay.

35:40.288 --> 35:43.473
I think I did, too,
for a while.

35:47.962 --> 35:51.648
(both sniffling)

35:51.875 --> 35:53.208
(Chimney exhales sharply)

35:53.301 --> 35:55.635
I guess we both spent
too much time

35:55.729 --> 35:58.730
hiding from the truth, and I
don't want to do that anymore.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.675
Me either.

36:01.677 --> 36:03.577
No more pretending.

36:05.313 --> 36:09.073
From now on, let's just
be honest about how we feel,

36:09.168 --> 36:11.293
and what we want.

36:12.729 --> 36:14.296
Okay.

36:16.991 --> 36:18.592
What do you want?

36:21.588 --> 36:24.347
She should be awake
from her nap soon.

36:25.409 --> 36:27.442
-(coos)
-There she is.

36:27.444 --> 36:31.646
Look who's here, Jee-Yun.
It's Mommy.

36:34.584 --> 36:35.692
She's so big.

36:35.936 --> 36:38.695
I swear to God, I've been
feeding her normal portions.

36:40.090 --> 36:41.773
You probably want
to hold her.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.849
Uh, she never liked strangers.

36:43.944 --> 36:45.702
Maddie, you're not
a stranger.

36:45.853 --> 36:48.780
I think I am.

36:48.932 --> 36:50.498
Maddie...

36:53.103 --> 36:57.105
She's grown up so much.
I missed it.

36:57.123 --> 36:58.957
I missed all of it.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.426
-(sobbing)
-(Jee-Yun crying)

37:13.065 --> 37:15.640
So you figure out what's next?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.216
I mean, back to L.A.,

37:17.385 --> 37:19.644
or should I be getting you
a job application?

37:19.796 --> 37:21.220
I don't know.

37:21.314 --> 37:23.389
It didn't feel right
asking her about the future

37:23.408 --> 37:25.224
when she was so clearly
mourning the past.

37:25.318 --> 37:28.152
Not the glorious reunion
you'd been dreaming of, huh?

37:28.305 --> 37:30.396
I never really thought that far.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.899
I mean, I imagined finding her
a million times, you know?

37:33.994 --> 37:37.145
I'd see her, she'd see me.

37:37.238 --> 37:39.756
Movie always ended right there.

37:39.907 --> 37:41.091
They live happily ever after.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.485
(scoffs)
Yeah.

37:43.578 --> 37:45.653
Kind of wishing
the end credit sequence

37:45.747 --> 37:47.347
was less of a bummer.

37:50.978 --> 37:53.603
You know, I was really mad
at her

37:53.830 --> 37:55.847
for not being there.

37:55.941 --> 37:59.017
But tonight was the first time
I realize what leaving

37:59.169 --> 38:01.486
actually cost her.

38:03.598 --> 38:05.690
You know,

38:05.842 --> 38:07.450
after we had our girls,

38:07.677 --> 38:09.694
Molly wanted to
stay home with them,

38:09.846 --> 38:12.289
so I went back to work.

38:13.366 --> 38:15.292
And every time I left,
I always said the same thing:

38:15.519 --> 38:18.036
"I love you.
I'll call you later.

38:18.188 --> 38:20.538
Don't let 'em do anything cool
while I'm gone."

38:20.632 --> 38:22.874
(laughs)

38:23.026 --> 38:24.617
Maybe if I'd just found her
earlier.

38:24.786 --> 38:26.361
You did everything
you could, Howie.

38:26.454 --> 38:28.638
All right, no matter
what else you're feeling,

38:28.865 --> 38:29.806
know that.

38:30.033 --> 38:32.083
I just wanted to fix her,
you know?

38:32.144 --> 38:33.626
Just make it all okay.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.037
Even though you know fixing her
isn't your responsibility?

38:36.097 --> 38:37.705
Yeah.

38:37.799 --> 38:39.891
Why do I always do that?

38:39.985 --> 38:42.060
It's how you're wired.

38:42.228 --> 38:44.270
Helping people is how
you help yourself.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.897
And because you love her.

38:46.049 --> 38:48.641
(chuckles)

38:48.735 --> 38:50.327
(sighs)

38:51.237 --> 38:55.557
I knew I had missed a lot,
and it's been six months,

38:55.650 --> 38:56.724
but seeing her...

38:56.818 --> 38:58.560
Made it real?

38:58.578 --> 39:00.319
Too real.

39:01.489 --> 39:04.232
I just wasn't prepared for
how much it was gonna hurt.

39:04.325 --> 39:08.736
I mean, looking at her, I saw
every milestone I've missed.

39:08.755 --> 39:12.073
But that doesn't mean that
you can't be there for...

39:12.092 --> 39:14.267
all the other ones.

39:15.929 --> 39:17.203
What about you?

39:17.205 --> 39:19.581
Did you talk to
your social worker?

39:19.674 --> 39:21.140
(sighs)

39:21.193 --> 39:23.175
Yeah.
(clears throat)

39:23.195 --> 39:25.753
Um, I have to go back to detox,

39:25.755 --> 39:27.847
then...

39:27.866 --> 39:30.925
another 60 days outpatient.

39:30.944 --> 39:32.660
And are you gonna do it?

39:34.097 --> 39:37.098
If I want to see my son.

39:37.117 --> 39:39.334
Yeah. I have to.

39:40.954 --> 39:44.622
Thank you for saving my life.

39:45.458 --> 39:48.033
I don't remember
everything I said,

39:48.111 --> 39:50.536
but, um, I know how I can get.

39:50.705 --> 39:52.947
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

39:52.966 --> 39:54.298
You were hurting.

39:54.467 --> 39:57.042
We're not always our best selves
when that happens.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.953
I'm really glad you're okay.

39:58.972 --> 40:00.880
Well, not yet.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.048
But I'm gonna keep trying.

40:03.217 --> 40:05.902
I have to.
(laughs)

40:06.129 --> 40:11.241
Not just for me, but for Robbie.

40:15.972 --> 40:18.164
Was I gone too long?

40:20.234 --> 40:22.810
I can't get back
the time I lost.

40:22.829 --> 40:24.829
No.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.832
But you can move forward.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.593
And the only way to do that
is to forgive yourself.

40:30.745 --> 40:32.153
And, Maddie,

40:32.172 --> 40:35.915
don't be afraid...

40:36.009 --> 40:39.185
to fight for what you want.

40:46.093 --> 40:48.352
<i> (knocking, door opens)</i>

40:48.505 --> 40:49.671
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:49.689 --> 40:51.305
Aww, how's my girl today?

40:51.307 --> 40:52.523
(Jee-Yun fussing, crying)

40:52.676 --> 40:53.933
(Chimney sighs)

40:54.027 --> 40:56.194
I promise it's not you.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.346
We walked by a park
on the way here,

40:58.364 --> 41:00.682
and she got very angry when
I said it wasn't playtime.

41:00.775 --> 41:04.368
Oh, that's okay, we can
go to a park. That's fine.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.354
Uh, I think we should wait
at least an hour.

41:06.447 --> 41:07.797
I don't want to make it
look like

41:08.024 --> 41:09.357
I caved in to a tantrum,
you know.

41:09.450 --> 41:12.952
Right. Oh, right, she's old
enough to have those now.

41:13.029 --> 41:16.288
Oh... come on, Jee-Yun.

41:16.457 --> 41:17.365
Don't you want to say hi?

41:17.383 --> 41:19.642
(fussing, crying continues)

41:20.979 --> 41:22.812
Come on, Jee-Yun.

41:22.964 --> 41:25.815
Don't you want to say hi
to Mommy? Hmm?

41:25.967 --> 41:28.226
(Jee-Yun crying harder)

41:28.320 --> 41:30.378
I'm not gonna lie,
this might be worse than

41:30.396 --> 41:32.655
going through colic
all over again.

41:32.882 --> 41:34.157
Can I try something?

41:34.384 --> 41:38.244
Be my guest, but don't be
offended if it doesn't work.

41:40.557 --> 41:44.892

Six months, six years.

Neither of us could
ever forget you.

to do now?
