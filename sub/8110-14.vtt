00:42.776 --> 00:44.478
- HEY, SWEETIE.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.779
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.116
NO, THE MEETING'S
RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.450
WELL, YOU KNOW MATHESON--

00:49.483 --> 00:52.653
THE GUY LOVES
TO HEAR HIMSELF TALK.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.790
YEAH. YEAH.
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE RESTAURANT.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.726
HEY, WE'RE GOING OVER

00:58.759 --> 01:00.094

YOU'RE GETTING PAID

01:18.446 --> 01:20.748

01:22.516 --> 01:24.218

THAN THE SMELL.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.520
USED TO THINK
MY JOB SUCKED.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.489
HOW MUCH YOU MAKE
AN HOUR ANYWAY?
NOT ENOUGH.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.723
THE DIFFERENCE IS
THAT THIS JOB

01:29.757 --> 01:31.325
IS JUST A TEMPORARY
SETBACK.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.695
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WILL ALWAYS BE A SCHMUCK.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.198
YEAH. SCHMUCK WITH A GUARANTEED
PENSION AND BENEFITS.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.600
I'LL TAKE IT.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.885
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.388
[woman chuckles]

02:00.421 --> 02:02.656

REAL ESTATE TONIGHT.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.492
I REALLY WANT YOU
TO JUST ENJOY YOURSELF.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.626
WELL, SEEING YOU
IN THAT DRESS,

02:05.659 --> 02:06.927
I'D SAY
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.329
GETS A LITTLE BETTER.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.664

WHAT'S ON UNDERNEATH.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.433

02:15.236 --> 02:17.805
OH, I THOUGHT TAKO
WAS A KIND OF TUNA.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.440
OOH. WE'RE SO NOT
EATING THIS.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.342
WELL, WE SHOULD
AT LEAST TRY IT.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.810

IT'S MOVING, BERT.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.685
REALLY?

02:31.719 --> 02:32.786
I'M NOT EATING IT.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.827
TO US...

02:39.860 --> 02:41.695
ON OUR THIRD ANNIVERSARY.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.466
THE DAY I MET YOU WAS--

02:45.499 --> 02:47.868
WAS--

02:49.237 --> 02:51.205
BERT?

02:51.239 --> 02:54.642
BERT. WHAT IS IT?
WHAT--

02:54.675 --> 02:56.844
HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.996
I ASSUME YOU'RE AVOIDING ME
BECAUSE OF THE CHARITY GALA.

04:23.030 --> 04:23.997
THIS FRIDAY?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.899
IT'S COMPLETELY
SLIPPED MY MIND.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.568
SO YOU'LL BE THERE?
NO, I MEANT

04:27.601 --> 04:29.303
IT SLIPPED MY MIND
TO TELL YOU I'M NOT GOING.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.771
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'LL LOOK LIKE

04:30.804 --> 04:32.005
IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP
WHEN I GET AN AWARD?

04:32.039 --> 04:34.375
LIKE I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT AWARDS, CHARITIES,

04:34.408 --> 04:35.943
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.711
IF YOU EVER WANT--

04:37.745 --> 04:39.079
I RSVPed TWO DAYS AGO.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.382
WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M A COMPLETE ASS?

04:41.415 --> 04:43.851
[elevator doors open]

04:46.487 --> 04:48.456
IF YOU WERE ALREADY GOING,
WHY DID YOU--

04:48.489 --> 04:50.791
FOREPLAY.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.099
WHAT?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.601
ARE YOU WEARING MY TIE?

05:00.634 --> 05:01.835
OH, I SAW IT IN YOUR CLOSET,

05:01.869 --> 05:03.537
AND IT HAPPENED
TO MATCH MY SHIRT.

05:03.571 --> 05:04.838
WHY WERE YOU
IN MY CLOSET?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.540
LOOKING FOR A TIE.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

05:06.574 --> 05:09.343
OBVIOUSLY, HE WANTS YOU OUT
OF THE CLOSET FOR SOME REASON.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.545
I SUSPECT MARRIAGE,
BUT I'M LIBERAL THAT WAY.

05:11.579 --> 05:14.548
NOW, TELL ME HOW SOMEONE
CAN HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION

05:14.582 --> 05:17.117
WHEN ALL THEIR TESTS WERE
NEGATIVE FOR KNOWN ALLERGENS.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.486
ENVIRONMENTAL.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.654
FILE SAYS HE'S
A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.989
COULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
TO SOMETHING

05:22.022 --> 05:23.557
VISITING
A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.893
HE'S LYING.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.562
HE'S NOT AN EXECUTIVE.
I SAW HIS HANDS.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.063
THEY'RE COVERED WITH CALLUSES
AND LITTLE CUTS.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.932
HE WORKS WITH THEM.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.901
A LOT.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.436
[whispers]
STAND UP.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.010
UH...OH...

05:43.043 --> 05:45.479

IS FINALLY GROWING UP.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.648

OF THIS DAY,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.583
BUT WHEN IT FINALLY
HAPPENS...

05:50.918 --> 05:52.920
SO WHAT DID
MR. MEAT HOOKS SAY

05:52.953 --> 05:54.922
WHEN YOU CALLED HIM
A LIAR?

05:54.955 --> 05:57.425
UH...

05:57.458 --> 05:58.792
I DIDN'T.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.663
HMM. BABY STEPS.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.032
GO DOWN THERE AND DO IT.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.000
UM...

06:07.034 --> 06:08.702
BUT WHAT IF I'M WRONG?

06:08.736 --> 06:09.970
I'LL JUST END UP
OFFENDING HIM.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.039
CONSIDER THAT PART
A BONUS.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.076
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEND ALONG

06:16.109 --> 06:17.878
ONE OF YOUR BIG BROTHERS
TO HELP.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.080
YOU WANT SCARY, SMARMY,
OR SHORTY?

06:24.685 --> 06:27.120
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

06:27.154 --> 06:30.057
ALONE.
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.129
UH, THEY TEND TO BE
PERSONAL IN NATURE.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.631
I'M HIS WIFE.

06:37.665 --> 06:41.168
I CAN PROBABLY ANSWER THEM
BETTER THAN HE CAN.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.604
THEY'RE ABOUT
HIS JOB.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.740
WELL, WHAT DOES
THAT MATTER?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.709
HE SITS IN AN OFFICE
ALL DAY--

06:48.742 --> 06:50.544
HONEY, TAKE A BREAK.
IT'S OKAY.

06:50.578 --> 06:51.845
NO!

06:51.879 --> 06:53.213
SERIOUSLY, IF THERE'S
SOMETHING

06:53.246 --> 06:56.049
REALLY WRONG WITH HIM,
I-I WANNA KNOW ABOUT IT.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.118
IT'S NOT.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.488
OUR QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT
WHAT HE EATS FOR LUNCH AT WORK

07:00.521 --> 07:02.890
AND WHAT COMES OUT AT THE END--

07:02.923 --> 07:04.558
BOWEL MOVEMENTS, MOSTLY.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.959
COLOR, TEXTURE.
SMELL.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.227
OKA--
[laughs]

07:07.260 --> 07:09.630
PRETTY SURE YOU CAN'T
HELP WITH THAT.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.599
MAYBE I COULD USE
A BREAK.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.003
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.971
YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.945
I CAN'T LET MY WIFE
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.980
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.248
THAT DEPENDS ON IF
IT'S CONSIDERED--

07:28.281 --> 07:30.083
WE PROMISE.

07:30.117 --> 07:34.121
I LOST EVERYTHING
BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION,

07:34.154 --> 07:37.257
MY ENTIRE REAL ESTATE COMPANY.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.127
AND SHE HAS NO IDEA.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.829
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING NOW?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.997
I USED TO BE A JANITOR
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

07:44.031 --> 07:44.998
AND NOW I'M ALMOST 40

07:45.032 --> 07:47.601
AND DOING IT FOR
THE PEOPLE I BUILT HOMES FOR.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.602
WHY?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.938
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.973
'CAUSE I NEED THE MONEY.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.008
NO, I MEAN WHY
LIE TO YOUR WIFE ABOUT IT?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.545
OH, N-NONE OF
OUR BUSINESS, REALLY.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.513
WHAT KIND OF CLEANING?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.549
INDUSTRIAL JOBS.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.050
CRIME SCENE CLEANUP.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.019
SEPTIC TANK REPAIR.
MOLD REMOVAL.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.856
IT'S PHYSICALLY KILLING ME.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.924
(Masters)
IT'S THE HOLY GRAIL
OF POTENTIAL DISEASES--

08:10.958 --> 08:13.093
CAUSTIC CLEANING CHEMICALS,
RAW SEWAGE,

08:13.126 --> 08:14.995
MOLD SPORES,
FUNGAL INFECTIONS.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.096
AND NOT TO MENTION
CLEANING UP BLOOD

08:16.129 --> 08:18.799
AND OTHER BODILY FLUIDS
FROM A HOMICIDE YESTERDAY.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.133
(Foreman)
WE SHOULD CHECK OUT
THE CRIME SCENE.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.234
HE MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP
A BACTERIAL INFECTION

08:21.268 --> 08:23.203
FROM THE VICTIM'S BLOOD.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.206
(Chase)
PLACE HAS BEEN CLEANED
AND SANITIZED BY OUR PATIENT.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.008
WE SENT FOR THE AUTOPSY REPORT--
PROBABLY TAKE A WEEK TO GET IT.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.577
WHEN HE'S NOT WORKING,

08:29.610 --> 08:31.745
WHERE DOES HE GO ALL DAY
TO HIDE OUT?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.080
HIS OLD REAL ESTATE
OFFICE?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.182
TREAT FOR BACTERIAL INFECTION.
MEANTIME...

08:35.215 --> 08:38.251
BERT TAKE ERNIE AND CHECK
HIS OFFICE FOR ENVIRONMENTALS.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.188
I'LL TALK TO CUDDY ABOUT GETTING
THE AUTOPSY RESULTS FASTER.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.593
YOU'RE BERT.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.661
HE'S ERNIE.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.029
AND THEY'RE BOTH
ROOMMATES.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.164
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.120
WELL...

09:13.153 --> 09:15.889
AT LEAST THE ALZHEIMER'S
PATIENT IN ROOM 202

09:15.923 --> 09:18.125
WON'T REMEMBER SHE ONLY
GOT HALF A HAM SANDWICH.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.294
I'M DOING HER A FAVOR.

09:21.328 --> 09:25.699
YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO THE CHARITY GALA?

09:25.733 --> 09:27.334
WHY?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.937
I WANNA DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.239
YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING
UNLESS IT STANDS TO BENEFIT YOU.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.807
I REALIZE THAT THREE
FAILED MARRIAGES

09:33.841 --> 09:35.175
CAN LEAVE A MAN
TWISTED AND BITTER INSIDE,

09:35.208 --> 09:36.844
BUT IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP,

09:36.877 --> 09:39.713
PEOPLE SOMETIMES DO THINGS
FOR EACH OTHER.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.582
A HUNDRED SAYS
YOU DON'T SHOW UP.

09:44.752 --> 09:48.155
YOU'RE GIVING ME AN INCENTIVE
TO ACTUALLY SHOW UP?

09:48.188 --> 09:50.223
A PERSONAL,
SELFISH INCENTIVE?

09:50.257 --> 09:53.026
I'M JUST MAKING EASY MONEY.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.227
200.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.833
HOW HIGH DID CUDDY
AUTHORIZE YOU TO GO?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.168
[laughs]

10:01.201 --> 10:03.236
SHE--SHE DIDN'T--

10:04.705 --> 10:05.673
300.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.875
SHE REALLY
WANTS YOU THERE.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.142
WHY DO PEOPLE BELIEVE

10:09.176 --> 10:11.178
I'M INCAPABLE
OF DOING ANYTHING NICE?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.380
EXPERIENCE.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.286
(Taub)
IT'S A TIE.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.855
I'M NOT WEARING
YOUR UNDERWEAR.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.057
I SAID I WAS SORRY.
YOU WANT THE TIE BACK?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.058
CAN WE GET TO WORK?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.160
I CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE
BEING PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE

10:27.194 --> 10:30.130
OR THIS IS JUST YOUR REGULAR
FUN-LOVING PERSONALITY.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.132
BOTH. AND YOU CAN
KEEP THE TIE.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.035
WENT OUT OF STYLE
FIVE YEARS AGO.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.125
VICODIN.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.760
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE
A PRESCRIPTION.

10:59.793 --> 11:03.964
WE DIDN'T TEST FOR AN ALLERGIC
REACTION TO NARCOTICS.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.298
(Taub)
OR IT'S THE OBVIOUS.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.335
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.715
WE THINK YOU'RE SUFFERING
FROM BORIC ACID EXPOSURE.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.883
WHICH IS CAUSING THE RASH.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.217
WE NEED TO DECONTAMINATE
YOUR SKIN

11:24.251 --> 11:25.886
AND HOPE YOU DIDN'T
INHALE IT INTO YOUR LUNGS.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.088
[breathing heavily]
I-I FEEL LIKE I'M--

11:28.121 --> 11:30.490
NEVER SEEN A FEVER SPIKE
THIS FAST BEFORE.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.193
ACID EXPOSURE BURNS LITERALLY.
IT SHOULDN'T BE CAUSING THIS.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.728
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO HIM?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.196
BERT? HONEY,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:36.229 --> 11:38.031
WE HAVE TO GET
HIS FEVER DOWN RIGHT NOW.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.199
IF IT GETS ANY HIGHER,

11:39.232 --> 11:42.102
IT COULD CAUSE PERMANENT
BRAIN DAMAGE.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.873
WE USED COOLING BLANKETS

11:45.906 --> 11:47.107
TO GET HIS TEMPERATURE
DOWN.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.508
HE STABILIZED AT 102.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.309
PROBLEM'S NOT BORIC ACID.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.912
WE FOUND NO TRACES OF IT
ON HIS SKIN.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.481
(Foreman)
INFECTION FROM
THE MURDER VICTIM'S BLOOD?

11:54.514 --> 11:57.217
AUTOPSY REPORT
WAS NEGATIVE

11:57.250 --> 11:59.186
FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.856
CAUSE OF DEATH WAS
AN OVERLY STABBY GIRLFRIEND.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.057
WE FOUND VICODIN
IN HIS OFFICE.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.392
GIVE IT TO ME.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.463
MIGHT LOOK LIKE VICODIN
BUT BE SOMETHING ELSE.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.375
[pills rattling]

12:22.409 --> 12:23.777
[inhales]

12:29.850 --> 12:32.152
IT'S REAL.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.855
UNFORTUNATELY...

12:34.888 --> 12:39.059
HIS VICODIN DOESN'T CAUSE
RASH, FEVER, AND JOINT PAIN.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.494
DOES MAKE TAUB CONSIDERABLY
LESS ANNOYING, THOUGH.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.530
MAYBE WE'RE THINKING
TOO FAR OUTSIDE THE BOX HERE.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.299
JUST BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE
PICKED UP ANY ONE OF A HUNDRED

12:46.333 --> 12:48.168
EXOTIC DISEASES FROM HIS JOB
DOESN'T MEAN HE DIDN'T.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.503
TAUB'S LIFE PARTNER
HAS A POINT.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.573
STARTED TREATMENT WITH
ANTIBIOTICS, AND HE GOT WORSE.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.009
SIMPLE ANSWER BEGINS WITH "M"
ENDS WITH "MIA."

12:56.043 --> 12:57.444
MENINGOCOCCEMIA?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.812
THAT WORKS TOO.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.181
CONFIRM
WITH A LUMBAR PUNCTURE.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.850
AND ON THE OFF CHANCE
WE'RE WRONG,

13:02.883 --> 13:04.017
FIND OUT WHAT ELSE
HE'S BEEN LYING ABOUT

13:04.051 --> 13:05.886
BESIDES HIS JOB
AND HIS DRUG USE.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.863
YOU SURE DO HIDE A LOT
FROM YOUR WIFE.

13:15.896 --> 13:19.366
YOUR JOB, YOUR DRUG USE.
WHAT ELSE?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.467
WHAT DOES IT
MATTER?

13:20.500 --> 13:23.470
CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS YOU'RE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH US.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.605
I WAS DOING MANUAL LABOR.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.440
IF I CAME HOME
BARELY ABLE TO MOVE,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.176
DIANE WOULD KNOW
SOMETHING'S UP.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.511
THAT'S WHY I TAKE THE VICODIN--
TO HIDE THE PAIN.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.213
I'M NOT AN ADDICT.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.815
IS THAT ALL YOU'RE HIDING?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.352
I DIDN'T JUST LOSE
MY JOB.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.421
WELL, THAT'S HOW
IT STARTED,

13:41.454 --> 13:44.491
BUT I FIGURED IT'D JUST
LAST A COUPLE MONTHS.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.227
I MAXED OUT
OUR CREDIT CARDS,

13:47.260 --> 13:50.097
TOOK A DOUBLE MORTGAGE
ON THE HOUSE,

13:50.130 --> 13:53.633
AND I SOLD ALL OF
OUR INVESTMENTS.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.635
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
THE RECESSION

13:55.668 --> 13:57.470
WOULD LAST THIS LONG,
HUH?

13:57.504 --> 14:00.974
SO IT'S OBAMA'S FAULT
YOU'RE LYING TO YOUR WIFE?

14:01.008 --> 14:04.211
LOOK...I SCREWED UP.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.014
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.548
I WANT YOU TO ROLL OVER
ON YOUR LEFT SIDE

14:08.581 --> 14:09.883
FOR THE PROCEDURE.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.289
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
DONE SOMETHING

14:16.323 --> 14:19.993
IN A RELATIONSHIP
YOU WISH YOU COULD TAKE BACK?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.294
MAYBE.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.131
HOW'D YOU HANDLE IT?

14:24.164 --> 14:25.332
I TOLD THE TRUTH.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.368
EVENTUALLY.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.003
HOW'D THAT WORK OUT?

14:30.037 --> 14:33.306
NOT WELL.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.310
[whimpering]

14:39.312 --> 14:41.915
I NEED SOME INTEL

14:41.949 --> 14:43.650
ON THIS CHARITY EVENT
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

14:43.683 --> 14:47.420
IF I GO, DO I HAVE TO
ACTUALLY GIVE MONEY TO CHARITY?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.492
I'M GOING.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.127
JUST DON'T WANT IT TO SUCK.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.663
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY
TO MAKE THIS FUN.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.666
SHOW UP AND BEHAVE.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.534
YOUR PROBLEM SOLVED.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.136
DON'T YOU THINK
SHE DESERVES MORE

15:03.170 --> 15:05.605
THAN A PLAQUE
AND A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

15:05.638 --> 15:07.574
FOR 15 YEARS
OF RUNNING THIS DUMP?

15:07.607 --> 15:09.142
IT'S A WATCH,
NOT A PLAQUE.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.111
IT'S A CLICHE.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.613
I WANT TO MAKE THINGS
MORE EXCITING,

15:13.646 --> 15:16.149
SOMETHING SHE'LL REMEMBER
FOR MORE THAN TEN MINUTES.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.617
OKAY. BY FUN AND EXCITING,

15:17.650 --> 15:19.252
YOU MEAN SCREWING THIS UP
FOR CUDDY

15:19.286 --> 15:23.090
SO SHE WON'T EVEN DREAM OF
ASKING YOU TO GO TO ONE AGAIN.

15:23.123 --> 15:28.628
YOU REALLY CAN'T STAND
SEEING ME HAPPY, CAN YOU?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.730
[door opens and closes]

15:30.763 --> 15:33.633
GRAM STAINS ARE NEGATIVE
IN THE FIRST CSF SAMPLES.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.004
ONE DOWN, THREE TO GO.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.339
I'M STARVING.
YOU WANNA GET A BITE AFTER--

15:39.372 --> 15:40.740
ALREADY HAVE PLANS.
DATE?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.375
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

15:42.409 --> 15:44.144
WE'RE ROOMMATES,
NOT A MARRIED COUPLE.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.113
WE DON'T HAVE TO EAT
EVERY NIGHT TOGETHER.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.116
SO YOU'RE SAYING...
IT'S A DATE?

15:49.149 --> 15:51.651
YEAH, IT'S A DATE.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.720
I DON'T HAVE PLANS.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.355
OOH. SHOCKING.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.757
ARE YOU MAD
BECAUSE I PICKED YOU?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.726
YOU'RE STUCK ACTUALLY
DOING YOUR JOB?

15:59.759 --> 16:01.228
A LITTLE HAZING NEVER
HURT A MED STUDENT.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.163
I DOUBT IT EVER...
HELPED EITHER.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.232
I'M SORRY THAT I THINK

16:05.265 --> 16:07.200
OUR PATIENT SHOULDN'T
BE LYING TO HIS WIFE.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.168
I'M A WOMAN.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.370
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.405
YOU'RE SHARING
THIS UNIQUE INSIGHT

16:12.439 --> 16:14.241
THAT WOMEN DON'T LIKE LYING?

16:14.274 --> 16:15.742
UH, NO, I'M SHARING
MY UNIQUE INSIGHT

16:15.775 --> 16:17.410
THAT YOU DON'T
RESPECT WOMEN.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.047
YOU SLEEP WITH A DIFFERENT
ONE EVERY FEW DAYS.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.083
OR MAYBE...
YOU FIND MEANING

16:23.116 --> 16:25.352
IN MEANINGLESS
RELATIONSHIPS.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.787
AT LEAST I HAVE RELATIONSHIPS.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.257
I'M SEEING A HIGH LYMPHOCYTE
COUNT IN THE CSF SAMPLE.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.624
AND THAT COULDN'T WAIT

16:31.658 --> 16:33.260
UNTIL THEY FINISHED
MOCKING EACH OTHER?

16:33.293 --> 16:36.129
THAT MEANS IT'S NOT
MENINGOCOCCEMIA.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.632
[pagers beeping]

16:39.666 --> 16:41.768
HE'S GETTING WORSE!
HE CAN BARELY MOVE HIS LEGS.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.003
I CAN'T FEEL THEM.
I CAN'T FEEL MY FEET.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.475
WHAT IS IT?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.143
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HIM?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.449
(Foreman)
LUCKILY,
HE DIDN'T LOSE HIS FEET.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.550
WE WERE ABLE TO RESTORE
HIS CIRCULATION

16:57.584 --> 16:59.452
BEFORE ANY SERIOUS
DAMAGE SET IN.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.455
(Taub)
IT'S NOT MENINGOCOCCEMIA.
CSF WAS NEGATIVE FOR BACTERIA.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.556
(Foreman)
BUT HIGH ON LYMPHOCYTES.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.392
IT'S SOME KIND OF
VIRAL INFECTION.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.227
(Masters)
SERUM SICKNESS
FITS EVERYTHING.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.562
THERE'D HAVE TO BE A CAUSE,
SOME DRUG HE'S BEEN EXPOSED TO.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.731
(Masters)
IN RARE CASES,
A TICK OR A SPIDER BITE

17:11.764 --> 17:13.700
COULD SET IT OFF--
SHOW OF HANDS.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.702
WHO'S GOING TO THIS
CHARITY THING FRIDAY NIGHT?

17:15.735 --> 17:17.637
ALREADY GOT A DATE.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.173
CUDDY IS GETTING AN AWARD.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.443
I THINK WE SHOULD
ALL BE THERE, SHOW OUR SUPPORT.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.544
I ASSUME YOU'RE PLANNING
ON SCREWING IT UP,

17:24.577 --> 17:26.113
SO YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE
WITNESSES.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.480
WHY DOES EVERYONE GO TO THAT?

17:27.514 --> 17:28.648
EXPERIENCE?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.750
SHUT UP!

17:30.783 --> 17:33.253
HOW 'BOUT GO...OR WORK
THE CLINIC ALL WEEKEND?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.455
I HEAR IT'S GENITAL HERPES
AWARENESS MONTH.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.491
SERUM SICKNESS FITS.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.794
TAKE HIM OFF THE ANTIBIOTICS.
START HIM ON CORTICOSTEROIDS.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.497
IF WE'RE RIGHT,
HE'LL BE BETTER BY MORNING.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.570
CANCELED DATE, HUH?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.572
YOU'RE BUGGING
MY CELL PHONE?

17:52.605 --> 17:56.276
NO. I JUST NOTICED
YOU'RE NOT WEARING IT.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.278
WHAT?

17:58.311 --> 18:00.647
YOUR FIRST-DATE SHIRT.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.583
YOU TRACKING MY WARDROBE?
I'M JUST OBSERVANT.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.852
THAT'S WHY
I'M GOOD AT MY JOB.
IT'S ALSO THE REASON

18:05.885 --> 18:08.888
YOU'RE STARTING TO ANNOY
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.590
FORGIVE ME FOR TRYING
TO CONNECT A LITTLE

18:10.623 --> 18:13.326
WITH MY ROOMMATE.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.733
I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT RACHEL IS NOW

18:20.767 --> 18:23.436
OFFICIALLY MORE
THAN JUST EMOTIONAL

18:23.470 --> 18:26.406
WITH HER ONLINE FRIEND.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.143
YOU'RE GETTING DIVORCED.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

18:30.177 --> 18:31.778
I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.881
JUST...THINKING ABOUT IT

18:34.914 --> 18:37.650
KINDA MAKES ME
WANNA THROW UP.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.257
YOU STILL WANNA GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

18:44.291 --> 18:46.259
I COULD COOK.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.364
OOH. THAT HAD TO HURT.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.766
NOT AS BAD AS YOU.
YOU JUST MISSED A FREE UPGRADE.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.335
HA. JUST DID IT AGAIN.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.836
YOU RAN PAST THE POWER UP.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.538
DOUBLE DAMN!

18:58.571 --> 18:59.906
[firing sounds]

19:01.808 --> 19:03.543
ARE YOU JUST
LETTING ME WIN?

19:03.576 --> 19:07.247
OF COURSE I'M NOT
LETTING YOU--

19:07.280 --> 19:09.216
[game powers down]
OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.551
YOU'RE HAVING FUN, RIGHT?
NOT ANYMORE.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.520
I USED TO THINK
THE WHOLE BROODING THING

19:13.553 --> 19:14.854
WAS JUST PART OF
YOUR WORK PERSONA,

19:14.887 --> 19:16.323
BUT NOW I LIVE WITH YOU.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.225
YOU NEED TO
LIGHTEN UP, BERT.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.260
AND YOU THINK I NEED YOU
TO SHOW ME WHAT?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.528
HOW TO HAVE FUN, RELAX?

19:21.561 --> 19:23.763
IT WAS WORKING
TILL YOU FLIPPED OUT.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.634
IF I WAS GONNA TAKE ADVICE
ON HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.502
IT WOULD NOT BE FROM YOU.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.638
YOU'RE BROKE,
YOU RUINED YOUR MARRIAGE,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.873
AND YET YOU ACT LIKE
YOU'RE THE VICTIM HERE,

19:33.906 --> 19:36.843
LIKE SOMEHOW WE'RE ALL
SUPPOSED TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

19:36.876 --> 19:37.844
YOU SCREWED UP YOUR LIFE,

19:37.877 --> 19:40.580
NOT SOME EMOTIONAL FRIEND
YOUR WIFE MET ON THE--

19:40.613 --> 19:41.648
[groans]
AH!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.883
WHAT'S WRONG?
MY STOMACH.
YOU--

19:43.916 --> 19:45.852
YOU POISONED ME!

19:45.885 --> 19:47.387
I ATE THE SAME THING
YOU DID.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.588
HOW COME I'M NOT--

19:48.621 --> 19:49.822
OOH!

19:49.856 --> 19:52.459
OOH...

19:52.492 --> 19:53.460
[plates clatter]

19:53.493 --> 19:55.462
OH, DEAR GOD.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.298
OPEN THE DOOR, BERT, PLEASE.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.832
BABY, TALK TO ME.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.735
HE LOCKED HIMSELF INSIDE.
HE WENT CRAZY.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.405
HE HIT ME.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.773
BERT.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.276
OPEN THE DOOR, BERT.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.279
[gasps, whimpers]

20:12.312 --> 20:13.513
BERT?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.328
[wood creaking]

20:30.663 --> 20:33.700
[walls creaking, groaning]

20:33.733 --> 20:35.468
I CAN'T GET OUT!
WHY?

20:35.502 --> 20:37.637
I CAN'T GET OUT!

20:37.670 --> 20:38.971
OH, LORD, OH, NO!

20:39.005 --> 20:41.441
WHY CAN'T I...GET OUT?

20:44.744 --> 20:45.912
SKIN RASH IS GONE.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.380
BUT WHATEVER IT IS,

20:47.414 --> 20:48.748
IT OBVIOUSLY
MOVED INTO HIS BRAIN.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.617
OR NOT.
(Masters)
HE HAD A PSYCHOTIC BREAK.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.919
I'D SAY THAT USUALLY INDICATES
NEUROLOGICAL INVOLVEMENT.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.821
USUALLY.
NOT ALWAYS.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.456
THE HALLUCINATIONS
STOPPED

20:56.489 --> 20:58.525
ONCE THE STEROIDS WE GAVE HIM
CLEARED HIS SYSTEM.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.627
I THINK THAT--
[grunts] MM.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.529
I THINK WE CAUSED THIS.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.797
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.866
TAUB TRIED TO KILL ME
LAST NIGHT.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.768
(Masters)
THE STEROIDS PROBABLY

21:08.801 --> 21:10.403
DID CLEAR UP THE RASH,

21:10.437 --> 21:11.738
BUT THE REST OF
HIS SYMPTOMS ARE THE SAME.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.740
(Chase)
AND NOW BILATERAL
CONJUNCTIVITIS.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.708
UH, EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE BACK.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.646
I...

21:19.679 --> 21:22.682
I, UH, BETTER GO
CHECK ON HIM.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.725
[door squeaks open]

21:32.759 --> 21:35.795
(House)
SWOLLEN JOINTS,
HIGH WHITE COUNT, FEVER.

21:35.828 --> 21:36.863
CONJUNCTIVITIS.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.831
ANYONE?

21:38.865 --> 21:40.667
Taub and Foreman:
SERIOUSLY?

21:40.700 --> 21:43.403
WHAT, YOU TWO CAN'T THINK
AND POOP AT THE SAME TIME?

21:43.436 --> 21:46.506
THERE'S A LIFE AT STAKE HERE!

21:46.539 --> 21:48.375
(Taub)
UH...COULD BE

21:48.408 --> 21:49.876
FAMILIAL MEDITERRANEAN
FEVER?

21:49.909 --> 21:51.478

A SYSTEMIC FUNGAL INFECTION.

SEEN IT IN HIS BLOOD WORK.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.435
USING FORMALDEHYDE
INSTEAD OF SALINE.

ON TRIPLE ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY.

TO KEEP HER HAPPY,

THEY'VE SHARED BODILY FLUIDS.

NOT THE FAKE ONE.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.959

MORE HONEST ABOUT--

22:39.992 --> 22:41.761
HOW IS THAT RELEVANT?

22:41.794 --> 22:44.030
IF HIS WIFE KNEW
ABOUT HIS JOB,

22:44.063 --> 22:45.698
THEY BOTH MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MORE ALERT

22:45.732 --> 22:47.500
TO THE EARLY SYMPTOMS.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.868
WE COULD HAVE
CAUGHT IT EARLIER.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.604
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.776
MY GOD, SWEETHEART,
I'M SO SORRY.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.812
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT WORKING.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.114
WE THINK HE HAS
A SYSTEMIC FUNGAL INFECTION.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.451
WE'RE STARTING HIM ON A
PARENTERAL ANTIFUNGAL REGIMEN.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.818
IT CAN BE TRANSFERRED
THROUGH BODILY FLUIDS,

23:05.852 --> 23:07.787

ON THE TREATMENT AS WELL.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.089

IT COULD BE FROM ANYWHERE.
THE SPORES CAN BECOME AIRBORNE.

HAPPENS...THAT WAY.

A FEW DAYS LEFT.

GETTING SELECTED.

WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE HAS ONE.

29:00.539 --> 29:03.142
HE'S DEFINITELY DEAD
IF WE DO NOTHING.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.443
IF I'M WRONG,

29:04.476 --> 29:07.980
ALL WE DO
IS SHAVE A FEW HOURS OFF.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.215
WE'LL NEED HIS WIFE'S
CONSENT.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.217

29:11.250 --> 29:13.385
PROBABLY
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.875
JUST WANTED TO WATCH.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.344
DO YOU EVEN LIKE ME?

29:38.377 --> 29:40.512
WHY?

29:40.546 --> 29:42.849
I PUT MAKING FRIENDS
AND HAVING RELATIONSHIPS ON HOLD

29:42.882 --> 29:45.017
SO I COULD CONCENTRATE
ON STUDYING.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.285

29:46.318 --> 29:48.520
THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME
FOR THAT IN THE FUTURE.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.360

I CAN'T EVEN GET A DATE
TO THIS CHARITY EVENT.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.601

RELATIONSHIPS

30:02.634 --> 30:04.904
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE,

30:04.937 --> 30:07.106
HOW WILL I EVER
DO IT WITH A PATIENT?

30:15.882 --> 30:17.616
BE HONEST WITH HER.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.385
BUT IF IT COMES DOWN
TO A CHOICE

30:19.418 --> 30:21.587
BETWEEN THE BRUTAL TRUTH
AND HOPE,

30:21.620 --> 30:23.289
SIDE WITH HOPE.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.434
HE'S IN A COMA.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.369
WE THINK IT'S A BRAIN TUMOR,

30:37.403 --> 30:40.039
AND WE NEED YOUR PERMISSION
TO START TREATMENT.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.574
DUE TO HIS CURRENT CONDITION,
THE RISK FACTOR--

30:42.608 --> 30:45.111
YOU MEAN...
IT COULD KILL HIM?

30:45.144 --> 30:48.881
IT'S POSSIBLE.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.984
BUT...THERE IS STILL HOPE.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.655
CAN HE HEAR ME?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.624
THEY SAY THAT--

30:58.657 --> 31:01.393
THAT PEOPLE IN COMAS
CAN STILL DO THAT.

31:01.427 --> 31:05.864
SOMETIMES,
BUT YOUR HUSBAND'S HEARING...

31:07.433 --> 31:09.635
IS FINE.

OF THOSE AWFUL THINGS I SAID.

FROM YOU.

AT THE RESTAURANT...

32:03.489 --> 32:05.557
BUT YOU GOT SICK.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.663
AND I WANTED TO WAIT
UNTIL YOU FELT BETTER.

YOU'RE GONNA BE A DADDY.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.471
(House)
WHY RASH AGAIN?

32:52.504 --> 32:53.605
IT WENT AWAY.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.307
IT NEEDS A REASON
TO COME BACK.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.476
WE KNOW IT'S NOT
AN ALLERGIC REACTION,

32:57.509 --> 32:59.745
SO WE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING
TO SET IT OFF AGAIN.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.380
WHAT?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.649
(Taub)
WE PUT HIM ON DIALYSIS?
MOVED HIM TO THE ICU?

33:03.682 --> 33:06.252
WE ALSO DID A PARTIAL MRI.
TWO HOURS BEFORE
THE RASH CAME BACK.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.054
THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.255
WHAT WAS HE DOING

33:09.288 --> 33:10.689
TWO HOURS BEFORE
HE BROKE OUT THE FIRST TIME?

STILL NOT SEEING
THE CONNECTION.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.129
WE'VE BEEN MISSING
CONNECTIONS THIS ENTIRE CASE.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.497
DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.799
DID HE SHOW ANY SIGNS OF
STRESS IN THE MRI ROOM?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.734
HE SAID HE WAS COLD,

33:22.768 --> 33:25.537
BUT IT'S ALWAYS
FREEZING IN THERE.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.439
COLD AND RASH.

33:27.473 --> 33:28.807
COLD URTICARIA
CAUSES RASH,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.110
BUT IT'S ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS
AND NOT TIME-DELAYED.

33:31.143 --> 33:34.280
(Foreman)
AND IT WOULDN'T EXPLAIN
HIS OTHER SYMPTOMS.

33:34.313 --> 33:37.249
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.751
WE MADE HIM COLD.
