02:22.873 --> 02:26.977
- Jesus Christ!  Do you have to do that?
- It's my car!  So just shut up and drive!

02:39.448 --> 02:42.224
WASHINGTON D.C.
19 MILES

02:51.777 --> 02:53.587
There's someone out there!

02:55.005 --> 02:55.963
It's one of them!

02:55.964 --> 02:58.425
- I don't think so...
- It's one of them!

03:05.265 --> 03:06.850
Jesus Christ!

03:27.120 --> 03:29.372
- Are you alright?
- I hit my...

03:41.384 --> 03:43.261
Alright! It's alright.

03:46.013 --> 03:47.723
I'm sorry.

03:49.851 --> 03:51.853
I think I knew him once.

03:55.356 --> 03:57.191
Where are we?

04:00.653 --> 04:03.322
God!  Jesus.
I think I broke a rib...

04:05.032 --> 04:07.744
Suck it up!
We got to get out of here.

04:11.622 --> 04:14.375
Honk the horn.
Maybe they'll give us a ride.

04:31.725 --> 04:33.352
David?

04:33.560 --> 04:36.313
David, Jesus.
Pop the trunk.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.775
God damn it!

04:48.200 --> 04:49.952
There's a semi-automatic in there.

04:50.118 --> 04:51.750
What's the point, Jane?

04:51.787 --> 04:54.712
The point is we're not giving up!

04:54.749 --> 04:57.918
And we're definitely not
giving up to a bunch of cripples,

04:59.461 --> 05:00.586
stinkers!

05:00.587 --> 05:02.511
Maggot infested...

05:02.548 --> 05:06.051
crazy, zombie dissidents!

05:06.384 --> 05:08.136
Come and get it!

05:08.173 --> 05:09.751
Come on, you pussies!

05:09.788 --> 05:14.143
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna take their goddamn truck...

05:14.179 --> 05:16.645
Grab that gun, you chicken shit!

05:17.980 --> 05:20.023
See the trick.
Is to aim low!

05:20.265 --> 05:22.267
Take their legs out!

05:23.109 --> 05:25.778
You can't kill them, but
you can slow 'em up!

05:25.815 --> 05:28.579
Oh .. get up you pansies!

05:28.616 --> 05:31.743
- Bring it on!
- I'm sorry, Jane!

05:31.780 --> 05:33.495
I'm truly sorry.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.856
Oh! Who cares!
Shut up and shoot!

05:35.892 --> 05:37.749
It's my fault...

05:38.291 --> 05:40.418
The whole damn thing...

05:40.793 --> 05:43.045
It's all my fault.

05:44.248 --> 05:47.050
*** Jesus!

05:48.785 --> 05:51.054
I'm sorry, Jane.

05:52.806 --> 05:54.515
I never should have opened my mouth.

06:04.526 --> 06:07.612
I remember the night
the world went to hell.

06:07.654 --> 06:11.407
It was the night I first met Jane.

06:15.879 --> 06:19.082
We're back on "Marty Clark Live"
with our special guest

06:19.118 --> 06:21.834
constitutional scholar, Jane Cleaver,

06:21.876 --> 06:23.675
whose new book is:

06:23.711 --> 06:28.090
"Subversion: How the Radical Left
took over cable news."

06:28.127 --> 06:29.889
And a good friend, David Murch

06:29.925 --> 06:32.554
who is a former
presidential speech writer,

06:32.590 --> 06:35.981
and high priced campaign consultant.
Welcome, David.

06:36.557 --> 06:39.000
With the elections just
three weeks away,

06:39.001 --> 06:42.021
the President is in
full campaign mode.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.692
Just this week in Boulder,
several protesters were arrested ,

06:46.817 --> 06:52.532
when they took off their coats
to reveal anti-war T-Shirts.

06:52.568 --> 06:53.365
David?

06:53.366 --> 06:55.465
There has been several
of these incidents.

06:55.501 --> 06:58.412
The protesters say they
have a right to free speech.

06:58.449 --> 07:00.998
Does the President have a policy

07:01.039 --> 07:03.255
of suppressing dissent?

07:03.292 --> 07:06.384
Well, look Marty. The President
has a 1st Amendment right

07:06.420 --> 07:10.132
to take his case to the American
people without being shuttered down.

07:10.382 --> 07:13.552
But to answer your question,
no there is no policy.

07:13.589 --> 07:16.513
The Secret Service is there
to protect the President.

07:16.550 --> 07:18.837
Now they gonna err
on the side of caution.

07:18.874 --> 07:20.856
Jane looks like she's going to
jump out from her chair!

07:20.892 --> 07:23.446
Marty, please!
If you look at these protesters,

07:23.482 --> 07:26.320
you see men with breasts
and women with armpit hair.

07:26.357 --> 07:29.005
They are ugly, stupid, coarse.

07:29.006 --> 07:31.066
They have nothing to offer
but hate for this country.

07:31.101 --> 07:32.971
And they know the only
way they could ever get on TV,

07:33.008 --> 07:35.231
is to defecate in public on our
President and our troops...

07:35.368 --> 07:36.908
- Jane, please!
- And you, Marty.

07:36.945 --> 07:38.666
You are their collaborator.

07:38.702 --> 07:41.313
You put these repulsive,
horrible people on TV

07:41.314 --> 07:43.445
which is all that they
want to begin with, so...

07:43.480 --> 07:45.167
Thanks!
Mission accomplished.

07:46.393 --> 07:49.796
We go now live to Altoona, Pennsylvania

07:49.832 --> 07:53.007
and we're being joined
by Mrs. Janet Hofstadter.

07:53.044 --> 07:54.504
Welcome, Mrs. Hofstadter.

07:54.510 --> 07:58.013
You are what used to be
called the "Gold Star Mum"

07:58.347 --> 07:59.764
That's right, Marty.

07:59.765 --> 08:03.476
And your son, Corporal Gordon
Hofstadter was killed in action.

08:03.513 --> 08:05.483
July 8th of this year.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.803
And you were detained
by the Secret Service,

08:08.840 --> 08:12.319
for heckling the President.
What exactly did you say to him?

08:12.903 --> 08:15.197
I stood up and I asked him:

08:16.281 --> 08:20.493
- Why did my son die?
- "Why did my son die?"

08:20.530 --> 08:22.388
And he didn't answer me.

08:22.424 --> 08:24.247
And I asked again.

08:24.497 --> 08:25.998
And again...

08:26.291 --> 08:29.494
And then I was grabbed by
the arms and taken out.

08:29.628 --> 08:31.796
Why did you say that to the President?

08:33.339 --> 08:35.597
Because no one else will.

08:35.633 --> 08:39.010
They told us there was
a threat to America.

08:40.011 --> 08:42.796
But the weapons of mass
destruction weren't there.

08:42.832 --> 08:46.394
Their nuclear program wasn't there,
the threat wasn't there.

08:46.978 --> 08:50.800
And here is the President surrounded
by his supporters and his yes men,

08:50.822 --> 08:54.193
and they are talking
happy talk about his war.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.742
I have the right, Mr. Clark.

08:56.779 --> 09:00.492
I have the right to ask him:
Why did my son die?

09:00.528 --> 09:04.537
Thank you.  David?
What do you say about all that?

09:04.704 --> 09:06.990
First of all, I'd say Mrs. Hofstadter,

09:06.992 --> 09:09.166
I honour you, for your sacrifice.

09:09.203 --> 09:10.862
I had an older brother

09:11.277 --> 09:13.587
who gave his life in Vietnam.

09:13.623 --> 09:15.256
And, believe me.

09:15.882 --> 09:18.259
If I had one wish...

09:29.936 --> 09:34.817
If I had... one wish...

09:37.736 --> 09:40.072
I would wish...

09:40.906 --> 09:43.664
for your son to come back.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.203
Because I know he would tell us all...

09:48.873 --> 09:51.792
how important this struggle is.

09:52.793 --> 09:57.147
This is important struggle for all, for
the safety and security of all Americans,

09:57.198 --> 10:01.551
and... and how proud he is
to have served his country.

10:01.843 --> 10:05.248
Frankly, sir, I don't think you
know my son well enough to...

10:05.284 --> 10:07.056
Thank you, Mrs. Hofstadter.
Thank you so much.

10:07.069 --> 10:10.052
We'll be back after these messages.

10:19.068 --> 10:20.701
Thank you.

10:20.738 --> 10:22.281
Bring it on.

10:23.015 --> 10:26.368
There is no way you gonna
tell me that wasn't planned.

10:26.404 --> 10:29.579
- It wasn't I had planned!
- Ohh.  Come on...

10:29.621 --> 10:31.975
I mean, I've been hearing
about you forever.

10:31.976 --> 10:34.690
You're supposed to be
the smartest guy in DC.

10:34.834 --> 10:38.422
Now look.  The smartest guy
in DC just fucked up, okay!

10:38.458 --> 10:39.923
I just...

10:40.132 --> 10:43.098
I blanked out...  on live TV.

10:43.134 --> 10:45.678
- Never had that happened before.
- Well, it was great!

10:45.929 --> 10:49.390
You were like... crying.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.186
It was like... so...

10:53.812 --> 10:56.231
sincere!

10:57.565 --> 10:59.322
See, that's the thing.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.778
You have this... credibility.

11:02.653 --> 11:05.656
I mean, you and I are
basically saying the same shit,

11:05.693 --> 11:08.659
but people treat me like
I'm some sort of circus act.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.829
Do you believe that stuff you say?

11:11.162 --> 11:12.877
Yes!

11:12.914 --> 11:14.499
Well, I mean...

11:14.535 --> 11:15.916
You know.

11:15.917 --> 11:19.217
I mean, come on!
It's words... It's a game.

11:19.253 --> 11:21.130
You say whatever it takes to win.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.048
Well, maybe that's your problem.

11:23.085 --> 11:24.545
Okay.

11:25.426 --> 11:28.096
So you believe what you say.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.018
You believed a soldier would
come back and be like:

11:30.019 --> 11:32.677
"Oh! By the way, thanks
for getting me killed!"

11:34.435 --> 11:36.395
No!  I don't believe it.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.482
A couple of tricks I can teach you.

11:41.692 --> 11:43.995
That waiter keeps winking at you.

11:44.045 --> 11:46.194
Oh, I think I knew him once.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.991
- Ah, you were saying...
- Okay, here's the thing.

11:50.534 --> 11:53.662
You want the audience
to see you thinking.

11:53.699 --> 11:54.787
Right, you got a question.

11:54.788 --> 11:58.216
You know already know what you gotta
say... some dumb ass talking point but...

11:58.334 --> 11:59.835
You think about it...

11:59.961 --> 12:02.630
you drag it out, you go...

12:03.714 --> 12:05.554
Well...

12:05.591 --> 12:07.426
Marty...

12:07.593 --> 12:12.347
that is really interesting.

12:14.182 --> 12:15.768
Thinking.

12:18.062 --> 12:19.521
Okay.

12:20.022 --> 12:22.441
- Ask me a question.
- Okay...

12:23.317 --> 12:25.047
Well, Jane.

12:25.084 --> 12:26.742
Tell me:

12:26.778 --> 12:30.206
What color panties are
you wearing tonight?

12:30.490 --> 12:33.610
Well... Marty...

12:35.871 --> 12:40.500
I'm not wearing any panties!

12:46.256 --> 12:48.509
See?  I'm fun.

12:48.545 --> 12:50.524
I'm so much fun...

12:50.561 --> 12:54.238
All the... men in this town are
such emasculated pussies.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.526
They're all afraid of me.

12:55.561 --> 12:56.855
And why is that?

12:56.891 --> 12:58.685
Maybe they just don't like you.

12:58.721 --> 13:00.181
No, seriously!

13:01.396 --> 13:04.066
Maybe, it's the force
of your intellect.

13:04.149 --> 13:06.777
Now, there's not much
I can do about that.

13:08.361 --> 13:10.280
You know why I like you?

13:10.488 --> 13:14.701
I've known you over an hour and you
haven't made one single joke about my name.

13:14.737 --> 13:17.078
That's all I get from these bozos!

13:17.114 --> 13:21.492
Meet Cleaver June Cleaver...
beaver cleaver.

13:21.527 --> 13:23.960
Well... that would just be rude.

13:23.997 --> 13:25.755
I hardly know you.

13:25.791 --> 13:27.714
We can fix that.

13:28.072 --> 13:29.966
Then hurry!

13:30.466 --> 13:32.551
What do you have in mind?

13:33.219 --> 13:34.970
Well...

13:35.804 --> 13:37.557
Marty...

13:45.773 --> 13:48.567
Sorry honey.
I got to take that.

13:48.604 --> 13:49.776
No...

13:49.777 --> 13:51.945
It's Pothis...
That's my Pothis tone!

13:51.982 --> 13:54.273
Oh Jesus...  Can I listen?

13:58.327 --> 14:00.751
- Murch here.
- David?

14:00.788 --> 14:03.457
- Catch you at a bad time?
- No!  No!  Not at all.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.959
That's not the President!
That's Kurt Rand.

14:05.996 --> 14:08.258
- It's the same thing.
- David?

14:08.295 --> 14:12.216
Sorry, Kurt...  I just...
I have someone here.

14:12.253 --> 14:14.510
Some one here.

14:14.593 --> 14:16.720
It's not Jane Cleaver, is it?

14:17.638 --> 14:19.003
No!

14:19.039 --> 14:21.225
<i>Well, tell her hi if it is.</i>

14:21.350 --> 14:24.644
Hey, we caught you today on the
Clark show.  Pothis was watching.

14:25.146 --> 14:28.190
Oh! I don't know what happened there, Kurt.
I must have had some kind of brain clot.

14:28.227 --> 14:30.573
<i>No listen, he loved it!
He was moved by it!</i>

14:30.609 --> 14:33.325
- Moved by it!
- Hell yes. That's why I'm calling you.

14:33.362 --> 14:37.240
That bit about the wish and the soldier
coming back.  That's great stuff, man.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.367
He wants to use it
in a some speech.

14:40.827 --> 14:42.913
Jesus!
Be my guest...

14:42.914 --> 14:44.886
<i>Yeah, but here's the thing, okay?</i>

14:45.165 --> 14:49.503
He said it to you.  You just went on
the Clark show and repeated it. Okay?

14:49.539 --> 14:52.797
Yeah, well of course. We all know
what a silver tongue debater the...

14:55.508 --> 14:59.305
- Something wrong?
- No!  Everything's fine.

15:00.581 --> 15:02.641
Good work.
You tell Jannie bye-bye, okay?

15:03.100 --> 15:05.727
- Bye, Kurt!
- Bye, Jannie!

15:07.705 --> 15:12.775
Oh, I'm so gonna make you scream.

15:15.529 --> 15:18.615
"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac."

15:18.698 --> 15:20.867
Henry Kissinger said that.

15:20.992 --> 15:26.164
In DC, even second hand
power has its compensations.

15:31.987 --> 15:33.964
Oh my God! He is good!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.679
They just adore him.

15:35.715 --> 15:38.551
- What is it?  What has he got?
- It's a gift.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.386
He's not stupid.

15:40.470 --> 15:45.141
He has a way of making stupid people
feel like they are just as smart as he is.

15:46.183 --> 15:48.103
Murch.
I think this is it.

15:49.229 --> 15:52.529
<i>I suffer when I see
those numbers every day.</i>

15:52.565 --> 15:57.445
<i>I see them before you do. And until
I'm spent.  I tell 'em all the time.</i>

15:58.070 --> 16:00.286
<i>If I'm gonna have one wish,</i>

16:00.322 --> 16:04.786
<i>one big wish.  I'd bring those
brave young Americans back.</i>

16:05.787 --> 16:08.211
<i>Because if they could come back,</i>

16:08.247 --> 16:10.541
<i>I think I'll know
what they would say.</i>

16:10.666 --> 16:12.710
He was wrong about that.

16:12.746 --> 16:14.211
Dead wrong.

16:14.628 --> 16:18.411
The first incident took place
less than 48 hours later,

16:18.447 --> 16:21.694
when a regular night flight
arrived at Dover Air Force Base,

16:21.731 --> 16:25.097
carrying a brand new batch
of caskets from the war.

16:57.296 --> 16:58.881
Copy that.

17:00.215 --> 17:02.884
We've got another
civilian taking pictures.

17:02.926 --> 17:05.720
- Newspaper guys again?
- I don't know.

17:05.954 --> 17:08.848
Main thing is security camera.

17:24.723 --> 17:25.978
Copy.

17:25.979 --> 17:28.467
<i>Seen a figure running
around back of the hangar.</i>

17:28.864 --> 17:30.996
<i>Could be inside by now.</i>

17:44.718 --> 17:46.183
Sir?

17:46.219 --> 17:51.266
You are trespassing on a
United States military installation.

17:51.891 --> 17:55.186
I suggest you make
yourself known, sir.

17:59.149 --> 18:00.441
Sir?

18:00.442 --> 18:03.194
There are no cameras allowed here.

18:04.404 --> 18:09.116
It is against the policy of the
US military to allow cameras...

18:36.435 --> 18:38.229
Stop!

18:54.078 --> 18:55.767
Stop!

18:55.803 --> 18:57.419
Stop there!

18:57.456 --> 18:59.958
Stop!
Please stop there!

19:00.000 --> 19:04.130
Look!  I know you're alive, we'll
get medical help.  Please stop!

19:20.463 --> 19:22.022
Fuck!

19:22.523 --> 19:24.358
Freeze!

19:51.218 --> 19:53.971
At ease, soldier.

20:06.315 --> 20:09.987
Peggy Pepper's daughter came and
took us out to the Wounded  Steer.

20:10.023 --> 20:11.698
Have you tried that buffet?

20:11.734 --> 20:13.559
I just love those little
croutons they have.

20:13.595 --> 20:15.283
Sorry ma.
I gotta take this.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.868
Murch.

20:17.410 --> 20:18.911
What?

20:18.953 --> 20:23.332
Yeah, I'm just dying to do a show again
after he called me a "dick" on the air.

20:23.749 --> 20:25.974
Hey look, can I call you back?
I'm with my mom.

20:26.011 --> 20:30.173
His hip never really healed up
after that truck accident he had.

20:30.757 --> 20:32.425
Slow down...

20:33.426 --> 20:35.678
You drive so darn fast.

20:35.715 --> 20:37.221
Sorry mom.

20:37.555 --> 20:39.014
Murch.

20:39.223 --> 20:40.584
He what?

20:40.625 --> 20:43.645
Go fire his ass.
You don't need me to tell you that.

20:43.728 --> 20:46.522
Hey listen. Can I call you back?
I'm with my mother.

21:02.246 --> 21:05.466
Paddy Runihan's boy came
by to see her last night.

21:05.958 --> 21:08.002
He stood outside the window.

21:08.038 --> 21:10.167
In the moonlight, she said.

21:10.204 --> 21:12.297
So she went out on the patio.

21:13.199 --> 21:15.635
He just wanted to tell her goodbye.

21:16.552 --> 21:18.387
Paddy Runihan?

21:18.554 --> 21:20.347
Isn't she the one...

21:20.431 --> 21:22.558
Wasn't her son killed in the war?

21:22.594 --> 21:24.601
Yes, that's him.

21:25.102 --> 21:27.896
I thought it was odd when she told me.

21:28.438 --> 21:30.149
Well, what did she offer?  Med?

21:30.150 --> 21:32.735
Oh, I don't know, dear.

21:33.319 --> 21:35.905
Maybe I just got the details wrong.

21:44.246 --> 21:46.320
He liked chocolates.

21:46.357 --> 21:49.210
Well, you're making some
little squirrel very happy!

21:58.093 --> 21:59.385
Oh, go on...

21:59.386 --> 22:02.306
- You can answer it...
- No, no, no.  It's just my...

22:03.332 --> 22:05.934
A woman I've been seeing.
On and off.

22:07.311 --> 22:09.359
Have I heard about this one?

22:09.396 --> 22:11.431
Actually it's Jane Cleaver.

22:11.468 --> 22:13.228
From TV?

22:13.233 --> 22:15.448
Oh, be careful, hon.

22:15.485 --> 22:17.820
She is what we used to call a "skank".

22:24.703 --> 22:27.122
Hey Mom.  Wait here a minute.

22:31.251 --> 22:32.501
Hey?

22:32.502 --> 22:33.961
Buddy?

22:36.089 --> 22:38.258
Hey buddy?
What the hell are you doing?

22:56.484 --> 22:58.987
Mom!  Get in the car!

22:59.404 --> 23:01.239
Lock the door.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.259
What happened?

23:58.296 --> 24:01.549
- Those men.  They look like they...
- Look, mom!  I don't know what they...

24:01.674 --> 24:06.303
I don't know who they were okay,
but we're safe now, so you can relax.

24:11.891 --> 24:12.892
Murch.

24:12.893 --> 24:15.609
<i>David, we got us a little
situation developing here.</i>

24:15.646 --> 24:18.273
<i>If I tell you what it is,
you're gonna think I'm crazy!</i>

24:18.310 --> 24:20.408
Yeah!  Try me!

24:23.420 --> 24:24.509
All vets?

24:24.510 --> 24:27.769
Veterans of the current
engagement, to be precise.

24:27.949 --> 24:31.203
Remember that little speech of
yours about a soldier coming back?

24:31.240 --> 24:32.078
Yeah.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.998
That one is no longer
in heavy rotation.

24:36.750 --> 24:38.632
BIOMEDICAL
LABORATORY 3

24:38.668 --> 24:40.337
Hope you haven't just need this.

24:42.989 --> 24:45.968
- Oh, Jesus!
- Yeah, I told you.

24:52.724 --> 24:57.270
David, I'd like you to meet
P.F.C. Bobby Earl Bieller.

24:57.854 --> 24:59.939
So say "hi" Pecker Wood!

25:00.198 --> 25:03.172
Oh, sorry.  He can't say "hi".
No vocal chords.

25:03.209 --> 25:05.946
He could wave though,
if he had any manners.

25:06.529 --> 25:08.803
Private Bieller here died
on the operating table,

25:08.839 --> 25:12.076
after which he put up a hell of a fuss.

25:12.113 --> 25:14.328
How many of these...

25:14.662 --> 25:16.794
these cases are there?

25:16.831 --> 25:19.125
About 2 dozen, that we know about.

25:19.209 --> 25:21.987
Words are getting around, that
the papers are afraid to touch it

25:22.023 --> 25:23.698
cause it is damn weird.

25:23.734 --> 25:25.721
They are on the streets, Kurt.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.279
There's no... hushing this one up.

25:27.315 --> 25:28.801
I figure we have a day or two.

25:28.926 --> 25:31.095
After that, we need a good, solid lie.

25:31.131 --> 25:32.643
But what is happening?

25:32.680 --> 25:35.105
How can a dead soldier get up?

25:35.141 --> 25:37.810
Don't know, buddy...
That's why we got this lab.

25:37.977 --> 25:39.484
The thing is:

25:39.520 --> 25:42.556
We can't kill 'em!
And God knows we've tried!

25:46.819 --> 25:48.445
Here.  You wanna to try?

25:48.482 --> 25:50.323
No thanks.

25:53.659 --> 25:57.538
Shoot 'em, they keep on coming.  Cut them
up in pieces, the pieces keep coming.

25:57.575 --> 25:59.587
We amputated his leg and
you know what it did?

25:59.623 --> 26:02.001
Damn thing kicked the
doctor, square in the ass.

26:02.835 --> 26:04.753
Not to be premature, but...

26:04.790 --> 26:06.673
I'm thinking supernatural.

26:08.216 --> 26:09.759
He feels it, Kurt.

26:10.218 --> 26:11.724
You see?

26:11.761 --> 26:14.972
- He feels pain!
- Ahh hell. He volunteered.

26:25.174 --> 26:27.080
It's something to think about, huh?

26:27.094 --> 26:29.111
A soldier who can't be killed.

26:29.148 --> 26:31.535
Takes a lickin' and  keeps on ticking...

26:31.572 --> 26:34.574
I mean, should all recruitment
undergo in the sewer.

26:34.611 --> 26:37.577
If we could keep the same dodgy
eyes out in the battlefield forever...

26:37.702 --> 26:40.748
- That's like the answer to our prayer!
- Kurt?

26:40.831 --> 26:43.125
Why do you think they came back?

26:43.625 --> 26:47.796
- What do you suppose they want?
- Couldn't be the disability benefit.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.049
A day later, when
the story broke wide,

26:51.086 --> 26:52.884
we found out what they wanted.

26:53.301 --> 26:57.097
And coincidentally,
we found out how to kill them.

27:02.644 --> 27:04.104
Excuse me, sir.

27:26.334 --> 27:27.966
Robert?

27:28.003 --> 27:29.796
Robert Bunton?

27:31.590 --> 27:35.844
What are you here?
What do want, Robert?

27:38.304 --> 27:39.764
EARLY VOTING HERE

27:41.457 --> 27:43.351
You want to vote?

27:45.729 --> 27:47.564
Do you have your ID?

27:56.614 --> 27:59.825
Do you need instructions?
You know how to use the punch card?

28:00.535 --> 28:02.662
Then you can go right over there.

28:06.374 --> 28:09.710
It's good to see you, Robert!

28:24.475 --> 28:26.894
- Where is he?
- Over there.

28:27.436 --> 28:29.313
He's voting.

28:52.545 --> 28:54.218
He's dead.

28:54.255 --> 28:56.423
He's really dead.

29:03.722 --> 29:05.562
A miracle, Marty.

29:05.598 --> 29:11.193
Nothing less than a pure miracle.
It is the hand of God!

29:11.230 --> 29:16.359
Reaching down to touch our nation,
our blessed President,

29:16.396 --> 29:20.388
our brave warriors
and their grieving families.

29:20.425 --> 29:25.077
He is the Resurrection and the Life.

29:25.244 --> 29:26.870
Amen!

29:28.188 --> 29:30.379
In addition to the
San Francisco incident,

29:30.415 --> 29:34.335
we now have confirmed reports
of resurrected soldiers in Boston,

29:34.372 --> 29:37.610
Detroit, the Florida pan handle and

29:37.647 --> 29:40.676
several cases here in DC, Jane.

29:40.884 --> 29:44.810
Well, Marty.  Far be it for me to
offend members of any religion,

29:44.846 --> 29:47.980
but if I am an Islamic fascist right
now, I have to take this as an omen.

29:47.981 --> 29:50.471
I mean, talk about our God
is bigger than your God.

29:50.506 --> 29:54.284
So you're saying that all of this is
just a stamp of heavenly approval.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.749
Well, I'm sure our atheist liberal friends
are looking for a different way to spin it.

29:57.786 --> 30:00.779
But if you remember what our
President said a couple of weeks ago,

30:00.815 --> 30:03.645
how he wished that our
fallen soldiers could come back

30:03.681 --> 30:07.084
and tell us how they felt about the
sacrifice they made in this great cause.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.916
Well, that's exactly
what we're seeing now.

30:08.953 --> 30:11.498
Not even death will stop
the march of freedom.

30:12.816 --> 30:14.422
It's a Murch line if I ever heard one.

30:14.459 --> 30:18.004
Which raises another point.
The Marine in San Francisco,

30:18.040 --> 30:19.500
Sergeant Robert Bunton.

30:19.672 --> 30:23.676
We had reports that he went to
an early voter registration centre,

30:23.759 --> 30:27.054
and cast a vote for president.

30:27.163 --> 30:28.848
Now Jane?
Is this legal?

30:29.807 --> 30:31.934
Well, Marty...

30:32.101 --> 30:33.978
The laws vary by state.

30:34.015 --> 30:35.818
There are two questions here:

30:35.855 --> 30:38.883
One.  Are the soldiers legally dead?

30:38.919 --> 30:40.698
Is "undead" the same as "dead"?

30:40.734 --> 30:44.239
And two.  This man is a hero
who died fighting for this country.

30:44.322 --> 30:47.325
Who's gonna tell him,
he doesn't have the right to vote?

30:48.576 --> 30:49.784
David?

30:49.785 --> 30:51.296
You have transformed that girl.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.111
She's... She's so damn credible!

30:54.148 --> 30:56.250
Just give her a
couple of talking points.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.608
What do you say, Kathy?

30:57.609 --> 31:00.134
Think we could put
this gal in office?  Huh?

31:00.171 --> 31:02.578
Something small at first...
Maybe the Senate.

31:02.615 --> 31:06.221
Come on.  Can you see her in a
debate, with him feeding her lines?

31:06.358 --> 31:08.829
And those legs of hers...
in a little leather mini.

31:08.866 --> 31:10.722
Yeah, like you care...

31:11.014 --> 31:13.147
If you want to talk about
President, Marty,

31:13.183 --> 31:16.770
you should call those dead people
when voting this time again.

31:17.897 --> 31:21.275
- Yeah, sure...
- We'll take a break. We'll be right back.

31:21.317 --> 31:23.277
Gentlemen.
I think we created a monster.

31:23.313 --> 31:25.654
Smile, bad boy.
You've done good.

31:25.696 --> 31:28.031
We don't know what we're
messing with here, Kurt.

31:28.156 --> 31:31.034
This could jump right up
and bite us on the ass.

31:31.070 --> 31:33.187
Well it jumped and it bit.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.412
What's is problem?

31:34.413 --> 31:38.458
The dead wanted to vote, alright.
They just didn't want to vote for us.

31:40.002 --> 31:42.384
I saw one of those things today.

31:42.420 --> 31:45.073
I was in Caffeine City and
I looked out window and it was like...

31:45.110 --> 31:47.097
Oh God!
There it was.

31:47.133 --> 31:50.929
I mean, it was like guys in uniform,
but only with like, some skin.

31:52.139 --> 31:53.640
I think he knew me.

31:57.644 --> 31:59.104
Murch.

32:01.481 --> 32:03.024
What?

32:05.853 --> 32:07.788
Hey, my segment's
after the commercial!

32:07.801 --> 32:09.448
Not now.
We got a talker.

32:09.823 --> 32:12.117
Have you ever been in a war, sir?

32:12.909 --> 32:16.292
You've seen men get killed?

32:16.329 --> 32:19.620
No. No, I had a medical ah...

32:19.627 --> 32:23.295
I've seen men get killed, sir.

32:25.338 --> 32:27.621
For a lie.

32:27.657 --> 32:31.469
Women and children killed...
for a lie.

32:32.095 --> 32:35.014
I seen my friends...

32:35.050 --> 32:38.107
killed for a lie.

32:38.143 --> 32:41.563
I was killed for a lie.

32:41.938 --> 32:44.357
What is it you want, Sergeant?

32:44.774 --> 32:47.193
We want one thing.

32:47.985 --> 32:50.237
We want to vote.

32:51.914 --> 32:57.804
We'll vote for anyone...
who ends this evil war.

33:02.024 --> 33:04.173
Bastard!

33:04.210 --> 33:07.004
It's as if the bowels
of hell had opened

33:07.040 --> 33:10.953
and then disgorge these
demons, in our midst.

33:10.988 --> 33:15.089
These Satanic spawned devils
that walk among us.

33:15.124 --> 33:18.177
The end is near.
It is at hand and...

33:18.212 --> 33:23.500
we must beg God's forgiveness
for our sins and immorality

33:23.511 --> 33:27.805
that has brought this plague
upon us... once a great nation.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.344
I believe we're looking at
shots here of Baltimore

33:30.444 --> 33:34.615
but as you know, the government
today declared that all zombie soldiers

33:34.651 --> 33:38.470
are a public health threat
pending further tests.

33:38.478 --> 33:39.617
So, how about it, Jane?

33:39.624 --> 33:45.418
Do these deceased veterans have
rights, and are they being violated?

33:45.626 --> 33:48.608
The fact is that, Marty, they
studied these creatures and

33:48.644 --> 33:50.552
they have no higher brain function.

33:50.589 --> 33:53.717
Their intelligence levels
basically that of a liberal.

33:53.753 --> 33:55.557
Do you let them vote?

33:55.594 --> 33:58.059
As I've always said.
You stand by the law

33:58.096 --> 34:02.200
The law says deceased voters are supposed
to be routinely purged from the voting rolls.

34:02.208 --> 34:05.609
- But you said last week...
- On top of which, Marty,

34:05.646 --> 34:07.865
these things, they are turn coats!

34:07.866 --> 34:11.100
They betrayed their country, and their
government and their fellow soldiers.

34:11.123 --> 34:13.300
And they're giving aid
and comfort to the enemy.

34:13.306 --> 34:14.527
Now... as I said.

34:14.529 --> 34:16.679
They're brain dead, maybe
they're not responsible...

34:16.685 --> 34:19.368
- Maybe they won't go to Hell.
- Verily they shall!

34:19.404 --> 34:20.409
So?

34:20.409 --> 34:21.702
What's the solution?

34:21.703 --> 34:24.998
Monsters, traitors.
There's one solution for both!

34:25.034 --> 34:28.333
Mobs, tortures... pitchforks!

34:31.279 --> 34:33.757
The face of this war
had always been ugly.

34:33.924 --> 34:36.467
We'd always try to
hide it from the public.

34:36.504 --> 34:37.885
But then...

34:37.886 --> 34:40.972
They were among us!
These dead young men.

34:41.181 --> 34:42.771
These monsters.

34:42.806 --> 34:47.353
Demanding only that we look at that face,
and acknowledge what we had done.

34:47.728 --> 34:49.188
Son!

34:49.523 --> 34:52.025
You shouldn't be out here in this rain.

35:01.742 --> 35:04.161
This will keep you warm for a bit.

35:05.497 --> 35:07.290
You want something to eat?

35:07.916 --> 35:09.667
We have some coffee.

35:14.171 --> 35:16.382
We know what you've...

35:18.634 --> 35:23.431
We want you to know that
somebody does appreciate you.

35:24.098 --> 35:26.100
We have a boy.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.519
Our Jim.

35:29.979 --> 35:32.231
He's over there, too.

35:32.856 --> 35:37.654
We don't complain... We know
that someone called to duty.

35:37.946 --> 35:40.323
But pray every night

35:40.364 --> 35:44.201
that he will... come back home.

35:44.452 --> 35:48.122
Alive and...

35:49.289 --> 35:51.291
That's Beulla.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.503
That's his dog.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.134
It's okay.

36:01.093 --> 36:02.845
It's alright.

36:03.470 --> 36:05.138
It's alright.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.061
What's your name, son?

36:17.693 --> 36:19.486
Michael.

36:20.404 --> 36:22.364
Michael.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.325
And that's a nice name.

36:26.744 --> 36:28.579
Michael?

36:29.705 --> 36:31.873
I'm Irene.

36:33.125 --> 36:35.127
Irene Baker.

36:40.507 --> 36:43.126
Are you from around here, Michael?

36:54.520 --> 36:57.148
God dammit!
Why don't they do something?

36:57.184 --> 37:00.333
Eat a brain or bite somebody's
throat out or something.

37:00.368 --> 37:02.362
God dammit!  At least we'd have
an excuse to round them up.

37:02.404 --> 37:04.414
We are rounding them up, Kurt.

37:04.428 --> 37:06.549
You grab one and another one pops up!

37:06.586 --> 37:10.495
We don't have the manpower for this.
The whole damn National Guard is overseas!

37:10.745 --> 37:12.293
Meanwhile...

37:12.330 --> 37:16.004
5 days to election and our numbers are
off the cliff, like wildly damn coyote.

37:16.005 --> 37:17.160
And you know why?

37:17.168 --> 37:20.547
Because we got these undead creeps
at every damn mall and bus-stop

37:20.583 --> 37:22.395
looking all shot up and pitiful.

37:22.432 --> 37:24.884
They do make quite an impression.

37:24.926 --> 37:26.802
Why don't we just ignore them?

37:26.969 --> 37:28.429
Say what?

37:28.512 --> 37:30.764
Just treat them like regular vets.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.064
Welcome home.

37:33.101 --> 37:35.191
Our heroic sons.

37:35.228 --> 37:36.980
Let them do what they want to.

37:37.016 --> 37:38.146
Let them sit around.

37:38.147 --> 37:40.049
- Let them vote.
- What are you now?

37:40.086 --> 37:42.151
- A zombie rights advocate?
- Why not?

37:42.568 --> 37:44.028
How many of them are there?

37:45.112 --> 37:46.905
What is it?
Couple of hundred now?

37:47.322 --> 37:50.702
- They ought to max out soon.
- Not necessarily.

37:50.738 --> 37:53.120
We got quite a few dead ones,
we're keeping off the books.

37:53.287 --> 37:57.791
Even so, a few hundred votes is not
going to swing a national election.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.710
Florida?

38:00.544 --> 38:01.752
Point withdrawn.

38:01.753 --> 38:05.925
It's not just their damn votes.  It's
all the live people they're getting to.

38:06.801 --> 38:08.344
Tell me something.

38:08.636 --> 38:11.018
The military vote is ours. Always.

38:11.055 --> 38:14.433
How come we can't find one
dead soldier on our side?

38:16.085 --> 38:19.020
If they died for a cause
they believed in,

38:19.563 --> 38:21.399
they're at peace.

38:22.358 --> 38:25.074
They've got no reason to come back.

38:25.110 --> 38:28.864
- How did you know that?
- Cause I started it all.

38:29.531 --> 38:30.906
Remember?

38:30.908 --> 38:33.994
If I had one wish...

38:34.161 --> 38:36.747
I wish he had that wish back.

38:41.043 --> 38:43.045
If that's true,

38:44.046 --> 38:48.508
the majority of dead soldiers support
the war.  They haven't come back.

38:49.193 --> 38:50.759
Tough sell, Kurt.

38:50.760 --> 38:54.973
Look at all the soldiers that support
our President by staying dead!

38:55.140 --> 38:58.310
Then give me an idea!

38:58.518 --> 39:01.068
The three of us sold a war, dammit.

39:01.104 --> 39:04.357
We sold a war based on nothing
but horse shit and elbow grease.

39:04.394 --> 39:06.219
We are the best in the goddamn game!

39:06.255 --> 39:09.410
It's not a goddamn game, Kurt!

39:09.446 --> 39:11.299
Why do you think this is happening?

39:11.335 --> 39:14.719
Because we sold a war based on nothing
but this horse shit and elbow grease.

39:14.755 --> 39:17.143
And those poor
motherfuckers died for it.

39:17.180 --> 39:20.331
Excuse me.  There is no
defeatist rhetoric in this room.

39:23.418 --> 39:25.258
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get drunk...

39:25.294 --> 39:29.179
within an inch of my life.  Then I'm
gonna sleep for 8 hours straight,

39:29.216 --> 39:32.068
while you go find a soldier
who is proud to have given his life

39:32.105 --> 39:34.220
for horse shit and elbow grease!

39:35.054 --> 39:36.514
Hold it!

39:38.758 --> 39:41.060
You don't have to piss me off.

39:42.020 --> 39:44.272
But you're a goddamn genius!

39:58.453 --> 40:00.955
- Which one is he?
- We'll find him.

40:00.992 --> 40:02.749
We keep records.

40:05.376 --> 40:09.004
Cheer up, weepy!  You're
finally gonna get your wish.

40:09.041 --> 40:10.928
This blows, Kurt!

40:10.965 --> 40:14.098
See, I blame Mrs. Janet
Hofstadter for all this.

40:14.134 --> 40:17.430
Going on TV, mouthing off,
making you cry like that...

40:17.555 --> 40:19.682
She's fair game now.

40:20.182 --> 40:23.936
And that's her boy right there.
Corporal Gordon Hofstadter.

40:24.687 --> 40:26.980
How's that for symbolic value?

40:31.844 --> 40:35.531
How do you like to be on
the "Marty Clark Show"?

40:38.909 --> 40:41.495
Can you talk, Corporal?

40:43.747 --> 40:46.166
Then, may I ask, why don't you?

40:47.043 --> 40:49.420
Hurts...

40:52.131 --> 40:53.971
We have a prepared statement.

40:54.008 --> 40:58.330
If it would be more convenient, we could
have someone read it for you on the show

40:58.331 --> 41:01.181
and you could simply
nod your head yes.

41:02.891 --> 41:04.894
Would you like to read it?

41:26.832 --> 41:28.291
So...

41:28.458 --> 41:31.920
You don't support the war.
You don't support the President.

41:32.295 --> 41:34.922
That would be too much to ask.

41:36.258 --> 41:38.432
Why did you go to war, Corporal?

41:38.468 --> 41:40.762
To protect your homeland, your family.

41:41.179 --> 41:43.223
To protect your loved ones, right?

41:43.431 --> 41:45.892
Those are noble reasons.

41:46.584 --> 41:49.312
- What's the mom's number?
- Speed dial 1.

41:50.646 --> 41:54.679
Rand here.  Put Mrs. Hofstadter
on the line if you would.

41:57.195 --> 42:00.031
Your mother would like to have
a little chat with you, Gordon.

42:01.574 --> 42:04.202
Gordon, honey?
Is it you?

42:04.660 --> 42:06.621
Yeah, ma.

42:06.829 --> 42:08.712
I love you, honey.

42:08.748 --> 42:11.626
They said I can only have
a second to speak to you but...

42:11.835 --> 42:14.170
there's a paper
they want you to sign...

42:14.796 --> 42:17.423
It might be better
if you sign it, honey.

42:18.341 --> 42:21.293
But you should do
what your conscience...

42:23.345 --> 42:26.313
It might be best
if you sign it, Gordon.

42:26.349 --> 42:29.231
There's so much I want to say but...

42:29.268 --> 42:32.313
I'm proud of you, honey.
I love you...

42:32.855 --> 42:34.565
I love you, Ma.

42:34.602 --> 42:36.150
I...

42:38.485 --> 42:41.121
Did your mom give you
some good advice, Gordon?

43:19.735 --> 43:22.237
Stop it!
Stop!

43:30.454 --> 43:32.852
You can let Mrs. Hofstadter go now.

43:32.889 --> 43:35.250
I don't want to bother her
any more, understand?

43:35.417 --> 43:37.461
No, this is David Murch.

43:37.497 --> 43:38.962
Mr. Rand...

43:40.589 --> 43:42.966
Mr. Rand can't come to the phone now.

43:49.098 --> 43:51.266
I don't understand.

43:51.725 --> 43:53.268
Why me?

43:53.685 --> 43:56.254
Why did I have to be the...

43:56.291 --> 43:58.481
the focus of all of this?

43:59.599 --> 44:02.068
It was so awful about Kurt.

44:02.104 --> 44:04.112
Just awful.

44:04.696 --> 44:08.742
- I guess Kathy wasn't doing his job.
- Yeah, I guess.

44:09.618 --> 44:11.369
Who's wasn't doing her job?

44:13.454 --> 44:14.914
Why do you ask?

44:14.956 --> 44:17.291
David, I want to be an insider.

44:17.542 --> 44:20.170
I want to have real power
like you.

44:20.545 --> 44:24.007
I'm learning so much from you.
It's amazing what you did to me.

44:24.090 --> 44:27.051
But Jane. You're funny.
You're photogenic.

44:27.468 --> 44:31.681
- You're more useful in front of the camera.
- Yeah, but I won't be 35 forever.

44:32.907 --> 44:34.855
You're 41!

44:34.892 --> 44:38.521
David?
I wanna be your protégé.

44:38.730 --> 44:41.107
I want you to groom me.

44:43.985 --> 44:47.196
- You want me to kiss the dead rummy?
- No!

44:51.033 --> 44:53.203
Is something wrong?

44:53.239 --> 44:54.699
Jane!

44:55.246 --> 44:57.874
Kurt Rand was like
a big brother to me.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.459
I watched him die today.

45:01.460 --> 45:04.964
I watched him die.

45:05.714 --> 45:07.799
I had never seen...

45:09.135 --> 45:10.887
anyone...

45:11.971 --> 45:14.223
Jesus!
What is it with you?

45:14.974 --> 45:19.019
It's like there's an answer to all of
this, I know... I know it's right there,

45:19.055 --> 45:21.820
right in front of me,
but I can't... see

45:21.855 --> 45:26.313
and I can't...
put my hand on it.

45:28.946 --> 45:34.421
Of course I didn't have long to wait,
before the answer puts its hand on me.

45:34.558 --> 45:38.334
But when you put this formerly
deceased veterans in internment camps

45:38.369 --> 45:41.125
aren't you questioning their
patriotism, David?  I mean...

45:41.162 --> 45:43.694
Aren't you really saying
that they are a menace...

45:43.730 --> 45:45.462
Of course not! Of course not.
Marty...

45:45.863 --> 45:48.382
Formerly deceased veterans
are in medical quarantine.

45:48.549 --> 45:51.343
Now I'm pleased to say
they've been... cleared.

45:51.379 --> 45:54.137
We hope to have them processed
and back on the streets by Monday.

45:54.174 --> 45:55.805
So they can vote on Tuesday?

45:56.556 --> 45:59.818
No one in this administration
would contest the right

45:59.855 --> 46:02.479
of these brave men and women to vote.

46:02.646 --> 46:08.234
And I resent that implication, Marty.
My brother gave his life in Vietnam.

46:08.271 --> 46:10.153
So you deny the allegations.

46:10.189 --> 46:11.696
Allegations?

46:11.779 --> 46:14.825
All over the web today, liberal websites.
Here's one...

46:14.861 --> 46:19.168
"Liberum Arbitrium.com".
It's a typical blog.

46:19.204 --> 46:21.668
One question for administration
mouthpiece David Murch

46:21.669 --> 46:24.850
who trades on his respect for veterans.

46:24.885 --> 46:27.045
If his brother did died in Vietnam,

46:27.211 --> 46:29.965
why isn't his name
on the Memorial Wall?

46:30.591 --> 46:32.446
Well, that's absurd.  It is.

46:32.483 --> 46:34.302
Where exactly, David?

46:36.179 --> 46:38.243
Well, I never...

46:38.280 --> 46:40.308
found it.

46:40.475 --> 46:44.901
There are 40 some thousand names...

46:44.937 --> 46:49.818
Marty ! This...
This is a baseless cheap smear.

46:50.276 --> 46:52.112
This is despicable!

46:52.737 --> 46:56.374
According to the documents produced
on the website here on the screen,

46:56.666 --> 46:59.530
Lance Corporal Phillip Murch
was honorably discharged

46:59.537 --> 47:04.916
and shipped home to Silver Spring,
Maryland... in March of 1971.

47:09.504 --> 47:13.674
You are among friends here, David.
Here's your chance to respond.

47:15.743 --> 47:17.303
Alright.

47:17.636 --> 47:20.534
Before we go to break,
condolences once again

47:20.535 --> 47:23.134
to the family of presidential
adviser Kurt Rand...

47:23.554 --> 47:26.987
dead at 52 of a massive heart attack.
We'll be right back.

47:34.611 --> 47:37.573
We thought it was best
for you, sweetheart.

47:38.366 --> 47:41.026
When Phillip came home, he was...

47:42.203 --> 47:43.913
He was different.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.208
I don't know if he got into
those drugs or what, but...

47:48.417 --> 47:51.254
It wasn't Phillip anymore.

48:21.074 --> 48:25.412
Mom said to help her
carry the groceries.

48:26.021 --> 48:29.291
Squirt, you can't...
frighten people like that.

48:31.793 --> 48:33.253
Okay.

48:46.650 --> 48:49.519
Okay, we're gonna help too,
okay, squirt?

49:12.918 --> 49:15.253
You would never have hurt Phillip.

49:16.012 --> 49:18.948
You worshipped him, David.

49:18.985 --> 49:21.175
You had no way of knowing.

49:21.551 --> 49:23.349
Halt?
Friend or foe?

49:23.386 --> 49:26.706
Woh, squirt. That's not funny.
Put the gun down, okay?

49:26.742 --> 49:28.646
- Friend or Foe?
- Put the gun down.

49:28.682 --> 49:31.478
- Friend or Foe?
- Look! This is not a game. Put it down!

49:37.817 --> 49:40.194
You are dead.  Get up!
Get up!

50:00.781 --> 50:04.969
You'll see, mummy... I'm going
to wish, I'm going to wish,

50:05.005 --> 50:08.102
for Phillip to come
back and be okay,

50:08.139 --> 50:11.471
and he'll tell you we
were just playing a game.

50:11.508 --> 50:15.604
- I know, baby.
- That will be my wish for every day.

50:15.640 --> 50:18.524
Till he comes back and be okay.

50:18.858 --> 50:21.027
You're a good boy, David.

50:21.485 --> 50:26.573
It was just a game.
It was just a game.

50:27.824 --> 50:29.826
We hope you'd forget.

50:31.661 --> 50:34.457
If we didn't talk about it.

50:35.499 --> 50:38.085
And eventually you did.

50:40.587 --> 50:43.799
- Son...
- Yeah...

50:44.424 --> 50:47.302
Do you think Phillip might come back?

50:48.011 --> 50:50.890
Paddy Runihan's boy came back!

50:53.183 --> 50:55.978
I would like to see him one more time.

50:56.812 --> 50:58.647
Before...

50:59.773 --> 51:01.691
I don't know, mum.

51:03.485 --> 51:04.944
I don't know.

51:05.570 --> 51:07.620
I had forgotten, alright.

51:07.656 --> 51:11.660
Mainly I forgot that you don't
treat other people's lives as a game.

51:12.077 --> 51:15.638
Now I had over a thousand
Phillips on my conscience.

51:16.706 --> 51:19.709
But they voted.
I saw to that.

51:19.917 --> 51:23.672
I went into Portusen.  I gave him
the sales pitch of my life.

51:23.755 --> 51:27.509
And on election day,
by God, they voted.

51:27.717 --> 51:30.053
And when they'd made their point,

51:30.089 --> 51:31.971
and their voices were heard,

51:32.008 --> 51:35.308
they were finally at peace.

51:39.947 --> 51:43.571
** exit polls indicate that
the incumbent is trailing

51:43.607 --> 51:47.158
in these two key states and
obviously he needs those states.

51:47.195 --> 51:51.324
We will keep our eye on that one.
That's gonna be tight all night long.

51:52.433 --> 51:54.952
You know that this is
going to turn out to be

51:55.620 --> 51:57.789
in history, the year of...

51:57.825 --> 51:59.958
We're down 6 in Ohio!

51:59.994 --> 52:01.584
How about Florida?

52:02.418 --> 52:05.087
Oh this is bad.
Bad enough.

52:05.755 --> 52:09.842
- You played it wrong, David!
- I did what was right.

52:10.226 --> 52:14.889
You put us in a damn bad spot.
And now I have to make the call.

52:17.183 --> 52:19.769
Do you really have to make the call?

52:19.805 --> 52:21.734
What should I do?

52:21.770 --> 52:23.689
Let the other side
steal this election?

52:23.725 --> 52:25.274
Steal it?

52:25.858 --> 52:28.486
Jesus, Kathy!
They won it.

52:28.861 --> 52:31.280
No, they haven't.
Not yet.

52:31.317 --> 52:34.038
Because we count the votes.

52:34.075 --> 52:36.374
We do what is best
for America, David.

52:36.410 --> 52:40.747
If the voters disagree...
That's their problem.

52:43.625 --> 52:46.342
It is a miracle come back!

52:46.379 --> 52:48.839
Unbelievable!
This is the story, friends:

52:48.876 --> 52:51.764
With 89% of the precincts reporting,

52:51.800 --> 52:55.012
the President has
now moved ahead in Ohio

52:55.048 --> 52:58.020
and Florida is now too close to call.

52:58.056 --> 53:00.831
The big story, the one
you want to look at is,

53:00.867 --> 53:03.504
what happened to those
early exit polls that indicated

53:03.540 --> 53:06.111
that the President was
going down to defeat?

53:06.148 --> 53:07.270
Didn't happen.

53:07.271 --> 53:09.429
Our course our news media
have gotten their story wrong

53:09.430 --> 53:11.368
once or twice in the past as well.

53:11.611 --> 53:14.864
It was almost 4 am before
they finally called it.

53:15.448 --> 53:17.201
Our side won.

53:17.237 --> 53:18.702
Imagine  that.

53:23.582 --> 53:26.298
Six weeks in Bora-Bora.

53:26.334 --> 53:29.379
That's what we need.
That will fix us right up.

53:32.006 --> 53:34.306
I can't, David.

53:34.343 --> 53:37.721
I have to ramp up. Kathy
wants me on the team.

53:37.971 --> 53:39.764
Really!

53:41.141 --> 53:44.143
- At her old job?
- No, you dumbshit!

53:44.180 --> 53:45.853
Yours!

53:46.396 --> 53:48.648
She told me you were packing it in.

53:50.275 --> 53:53.015
But you can still be my...

53:53.052 --> 53:56.156
mentor and spiritual adviser.

53:58.416 --> 54:00.168
Jane!

54:00.576 --> 54:03.529
You're so good to me!

54:24.601 --> 54:27.687
Kathy? What is it?
What's happening?

54:28.521 --> 54:30.320
I'm about to catch a helicopter.

54:30.356 --> 54:33.734
And I advise you to get the fuck out
of town till we figure out what to do.

54:34.151 --> 54:36.320
They're all coming back.

54:41.017 --> 54:43.708
They're coming out of Arlington.
All of them!

54:43.744 --> 54:45.685
World War II, Korea, Vietnam...

54:45.721 --> 54:49.083
We said we'd count their
votes, but we didn't.

54:49.124 --> 54:50.756
We lied!

54:50.793 --> 54:53.879
What were they going to do?
Well...

54:53.962 --> 54:56.382
They did what soldiers always do.

54:56.674 --> 54:59.098
They called for reinforcements.

54:59.135 --> 55:03.264
Come and get it you pansies.
Bring it on!

55:06.225 --> 55:07.976
I'm sorry, Jane.

55:09.636 --> 55:12.356
I never should have opened my mouth.

55:29.940 --> 55:31.709
Oh shit!

55:37.698 --> 55:41.176
- You're the one that called us back.
- That's right.

55:43.036 --> 55:45.180
You said we'd have a voice.

55:45.764 --> 55:48.725
- But you betrayed us.
- That's right.

55:49.351 --> 55:54.097
I got it coming.  Go on, I'm not
afraid.  Do what you gonna do.

55:56.065 --> 55:59.110
- Help us!
- Help you?

55:59.146 --> 56:01.071
Join us.

56:01.697 --> 56:04.491
We're looking for a few good men.

56:07.035 --> 56:09.167
Hi Squirt!

56:09.204 --> 56:11.539
Friend or foe?

56:14.041 --> 56:15.835
Phillip?

56:18.880 --> 56:21.174
Long time no see.

56:24.969 --> 56:27.393
You did your best, little brother.

56:27.430 --> 56:30.391
I'd be proud to fight beside you.

56:38.216 --> 56:41.444
The government continues in exile.

56:41.652 --> 56:44.355
But Washington DC, is ours.

56:44.791 --> 56:46.279
We are here to stay.

56:46.615 --> 56:48.330
All across this country.

56:48.467 --> 56:51.084
An army of fighters,
1 million strong

56:51.121 --> 56:55.249
who laid down our lives to
defend the land we loved.

56:55.541 --> 56:58.091
But know this truth.

56:58.127 --> 57:00.718
Our lives are precious.

57:00.754 --> 57:04.558
And if you ever again send
our brothers and sisters

57:04.595 --> 57:08.789
to give their lives for
a needless, pointless lie,

57:08.826 --> 57:13.184
then we guarantee that you
will see the true face of war:

57:13.601 --> 57:16.661
The Face of Hell!
