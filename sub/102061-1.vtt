Dearest beloved, there is a
lot of history in Central Park,

01:59.261 --> 02:01.230
and probably even more secrets.

02:02.797 --> 02:04.766
I know because I
have a few of them.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.208
Yeah, I've been at
the retirement party,

02:12.241 --> 02:13.708
didn't you get my call?

02:13.742 --> 02:15.177
Ah, I'm sorry,
I was in surgery.

02:15.211 --> 02:16.946
Well, I should go so
I can make my flight.

02:16.979 --> 02:19.748
You said you wanted to
try to make it here.

02:19.781 --> 02:21.317
Yeah, look,
yeah, I know I did-

02:21.350 --> 02:24.053
- Yeah, I know, a bar full
of old drinking buddies

02:24.086 --> 02:25.888
doesn't sound so
good to me either.

02:25.921 --> 02:27.856
I'm sorry, I was in surgery.

02:27.890 --> 02:29.091
Is Tom coming?

02:29.125 --> 02:30.026
Oh.

02:30.059 --> 02:30.792
Tell him he must.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.563
So you don't care
about your old mentor?

02:36.932 --> 02:38.733
Look, I'd love
to see ya, I would-

02:38.767 --> 02:41.870
- Your fate is not your
intentions, but your actions.

02:43.305 --> 02:44.839
Okay.

02:49.345 --> 02:50.612
Cranberry juice,
and could you put it

02:50.645 --> 02:51.881
in a wine glass, please?

02:56.651 --> 02:58.620
These days
I keep things light.

03:00.622 --> 03:01.623
I tell jokes.

03:04.326 --> 03:06.228
Why are there so
many blondes in hell?

03:08.863 --> 03:10.266
Because they're so friggin' hot.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.680
You are not allowed
in here anymore.

03:25.713 --> 03:27.749
What are you talking about?

03:27.782 --> 03:29.285
Out!

03:29.318 --> 03:31.153
Any red's fine, I'm a quantity
over quality kinda girl.

03:32.154 --> 03:33.855
You are going to get me fired.

03:34.957 --> 03:36.926
That is not in your future.

03:37.893 --> 03:39.195
John says you do a lot more

03:39.228 --> 03:40.862
than tell fortunes
across the street.

03:41.997 --> 03:43.299
- Thomas!
- George!

03:43.332 --> 03:45.267
How
wonderful to see you.

03:45.301 --> 03:47.336
Let me get you some
of what we're having.

03:47.369 --> 03:49.671
I wanted you to catch my
wife and some other folks,

03:49.704 --> 03:52.408
but they've left already, so
we're the last of the group.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.944
We are the veritable drunks,

03:54.977 --> 03:57.246
and I have every intention
of getting quite ripe,

03:57.279 --> 04:00.049
and your late arrival provides
me the perfect excuse.

04:00.082 --> 04:02.084
Well, here is to the

04:03.252 --> 04:04.752
perfect excuse.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.694
That's the spirit, my boy!

04:14.997 --> 04:16.731
Yeah.

04:16.764 --> 04:19.235
This guy is not only the
finest doctor, but the kindest.

04:19.267 --> 04:22.837
I can't tell you how many
patients have come up.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.440
Anybody 10 years
younger than me has got,

04:24.473 --> 04:26.108
stay for another round.

04:26.142 --> 04:27.675
As Virgil wrote...

04:32.915 --> 04:34.049
Anna.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.050
Wow.

04:35.084 --> 04:37.419
You look stunning.

04:39.121 --> 04:41.090
I thought
you quit drinking.

04:41.123 --> 04:41.924
I did.

04:43.092 --> 04:43.926
Till tonight.

04:44.927 --> 04:48.030
What happened, peer
pressure from your friends?

04:48.063 --> 04:50.099
Ah, I guess.

04:52.101 --> 04:53.102
I almost had a year.

04:53.135 --> 04:54.702
That sounds about right.

04:54.736 --> 04:55.737
That was the last
time I heard from you.

04:56.871 --> 04:58.174
I was on probation
at the hospital,

04:58.207 --> 04:59.975
and oh, to hell
with all that stuff.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.111
Anyways, I head upstate
before rush hour these days.

05:03.279 --> 05:04.446
You already finish that?

05:04.480 --> 05:05.948
Yes, do try to keep up.

05:08.150 --> 05:09.285
Would you like another?

05:13.022 --> 05:14.990
Put your phone down
and politely answer me.

05:18.994 --> 05:19.962
Yes.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.831
To you.

05:23.865 --> 05:24.967
The one you forgot about.

05:26.969 --> 05:27.970
Oh, I remember that.

05:28.971 --> 05:29.771
Thomas.

05:29.804 --> 05:30.838
Hmm?

05:30.872 --> 05:31.706
Go home.

05:47.789 --> 05:48.424
Hey.

05:50.192 --> 05:51.393
Can we start over again?

05:52.361 --> 05:53.295
From the beginning?

05:54.796 --> 05:56.999
Only if you do
what you promised me.

06:01.103 --> 06:03.505
Let's get outta here.

06:03.539 --> 06:04.974
That's a yes?

06:10.212 --> 06:11.080
Good evening.

06:12.147 --> 06:12.948
Shh.

06:12.982 --> 06:14.316
What?

06:14.350 --> 06:17.019
Relax, you know, there
are people live here.

06:19.121 --> 06:21.357
I got this as a present.

06:21.390 --> 06:22.191
It's gonna torture me.

06:22.224 --> 06:23.225
Yes!

06:23.259 --> 06:25.094
Yes, I will be right back!

06:32.134 --> 06:33.035
Voila.

06:43.845 --> 06:46.415
Do you and Brenda
still have sex?

06:47.616 --> 06:48.517
Not like we did.

06:49.551 --> 06:51.120
I like hearing that.

06:51.153 --> 06:52.187
You calling us we again.

06:58.227 --> 06:59.261
That's pretty.

06:59.295 --> 07:00.462
It used to be my mother's.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.165
I wish she'd met you.

07:03.198 --> 07:05.234
My grandfather used to
live on Central Park West,

07:05.267 --> 07:06.602
and my mother and I

07:06.635 --> 07:09.305
lived with him in
his last sick years.

07:09.338 --> 07:11.206
I remember.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.442
Sometimes my mother would
turn off all the lights

07:13.475 --> 07:15.611
and we'd sit high
above the park,

07:15.644 --> 07:18.247
and she'd read from
Sarah Mae's journal.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.081
Who's that?

07:20.282 --> 07:21.083
An ancestor.

07:22.451 --> 07:23.352
Are you religious?

07:23.385 --> 07:24.320
I always wanted to know.

07:25.521 --> 07:27.122
No.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.291
Do you consider
yourself spiritual?

07:29.325 --> 07:31.093
I'm a doctor.

07:31.126 --> 07:32.361
That's your answer?

07:35.230 --> 07:38.100
I believe you live
and then you die,

07:38.133 --> 07:40.903
and I'm gonna go
to sleep now, okay?

07:40.936 --> 07:42.471
No, Thomas, you
never talk to me.

07:46.975 --> 07:49.611
Well, my father was
a very religious man,

07:49.645 --> 07:51.880
but his religion didn't
allow for medicine,

07:51.914 --> 07:56.018
so I was forced to watch
my mother wither and die,

07:57.252 --> 08:00.222
when science could
have saved her, so.

08:00.255 --> 08:01.557
So you became a doctor.

08:01.590 --> 08:02.591
I don't know why we're
talking about this.

08:02.624 --> 08:03.892
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.533
Remember our weekend
in the Catskills?

08:17.005 --> 08:19.174
That's when you first promised
me that you'd leave her.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.683
This is a better time for us.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.618
I don't wanna get
ahead of myself but,

08:31.286 --> 08:32.388
I believe in eternity.

08:35.957 --> 08:37.359
Remember the first night we met?

08:40.261 --> 08:41.597
So where should we go?

08:41.630 --> 08:43.298
You live in this building?

08:43.332 --> 08:44.666
I love Central Park West.

08:46.034 --> 08:48.270
This is how you can
remember my name.

08:48.303 --> 08:50.305
♪ Ah Na ♪

08:50.339 --> 08:52.474
I like your two sinks.

08:52.508 --> 08:56.545
Which one does your wife use?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.981
You aren't regretting
this already, are you?

09:11.393 --> 09:14.396
Oh no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.636
Fuck.

09:20.669 --> 09:22.471
Good morning, sweetie pie.

09:22.504 --> 09:24.740
I ran out and I got more
champagne and I made mimosas.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.375
I also got vodka.

09:28.644 --> 09:31.280
I was thinking, we should
go to the park today.

09:31.313 --> 09:33.749
I got a
conference on Monday.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.251
Ah, that's Monday.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.619
No, I need to prepare.

09:37.653 --> 09:38.754
We never do anything
in the daytime together.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.689
I need to prepare.

09:40.722 --> 09:42.324
You can later.

09:42.357 --> 09:44.359
I really wanna have
a picnic in the park.

09:46.061 --> 09:46.695
All right.

09:48.063 --> 09:49.264
Let me look at my
computer, okay?

09:49.298 --> 09:50.399
Okay.

09:50.432 --> 09:51.233
Don't you take off just yet.

09:53.135 --> 09:53.969
I have an idea.

09:56.772 --> 09:57.606
Come here!

10:09.785 --> 10:12.187
So, Anne, you wanna sit here?

10:12.221 --> 10:13.589
No.

10:13.622 --> 10:15.657
Can I give you my private tour?

10:15.691 --> 10:17.426
Sure.

10:17.459 --> 10:19.261
My mother and I used to spend
days discovering the park.

10:19.294 --> 10:20.162
Follow me.

10:20.195 --> 10:21.029
Okay.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.769
There's
an old path here.

10:27.803 --> 10:29.538
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.141
I can't trespass.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.610
This used to always be open,

10:34.643 --> 10:35.811
but now it's shut off
so not many people go.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.346
I don't know.

10:37.379 --> 10:38.380
Thomas, no one's
gonna care if you

10:38.413 --> 10:39.648
jump over this low fence.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.582
All right, all
right, all right, here.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.521
See, now
wasn't that fun?

10:45.554 --> 10:46.355
Come on.

10:57.699 --> 11:01.470
It's hard to believe
that this actually exists.

11:01.503 --> 11:03.605
These days if something
isn't on the official map,

11:03.639 --> 11:04.673
it doesn't exist.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.541
Yeah.

11:08.777 --> 11:10.512
Huh.

11:10.546 --> 11:14.082
My mother used to call
this the wise woman tree.

11:14.116 --> 11:15.484
Really?

11:15.517 --> 11:16.552
Sounds like she was
really imaginative.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.721
This is something we
used to do together.

11:19.755 --> 11:21.423
You have to try this with me.

11:21.456 --> 11:22.491
You're insane.

11:22.524 --> 11:23.325
Come on!

11:23.358 --> 11:24.493
You're insane.

11:25.895 --> 11:28.497
I just remembered my
mother buried something here.

11:29.598 --> 11:30.532
That's bizarre.

11:30.566 --> 11:31.400
What was it?

11:33.135 --> 11:35.370
I can't remember
what or where.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.506
Hey look,
Anna, you know,

11:37.539 --> 11:40.208
that's great, but can
we eat, I'm hungry.

11:41.176 --> 11:43.412
That's your way of
ending a discussion, I see.

11:43.445 --> 11:45.414
All I said is that
I'm hungry, okay?

11:45.447 --> 11:46.515
Well let's eat here.

11:46.548 --> 11:48.216
That's fine, let's eat here.

11:52.154 --> 11:53.555
So what do you do these days?

11:53.589 --> 11:54.523
"What do you do?"

11:54.556 --> 11:55.857
Give me a break.

11:55.892 --> 11:57.859
You certainly didn't
care last night.

11:57.894 --> 12:01.396
Excuse me for wanting to get
to know you a little better.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.332
Why don't you ask more
important questions?

12:03.365 --> 12:05.367
Like why were we
brought together again,

12:06.401 --> 12:08.403
alone, here?

12:08.437 --> 12:10.238
I don't know.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.673
I'll give you one guess.

12:11.707 --> 12:12.741
I give up.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.343
Play, come on, hide and seek!

12:14.376 --> 12:15.243
I feel like I'm
with my daughter now.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.612
How is Mandy?

12:16.645 --> 12:17.713
She just turned
15 a few weeks ago.

12:18.847 --> 12:19.648
Lovely.

12:19.681 --> 12:21.149
Now, come on.

12:21.183 --> 12:22.250
Anna!

12:22.284 --> 12:23.118
Anna!

12:25.320 --> 12:26.154
Come on!

12:28.523 --> 12:29.391
Anna!

12:30.425 --> 12:31.259
Anna!

12:33.528 --> 12:34.529
This is crazy.

12:34.563 --> 12:35.397
I can't believe this shit.

12:36.598 --> 12:37.432
Anna!

12:40.569 --> 12:41.403
Come on!

12:47.643 --> 12:48.443
Anna!

12:53.682 --> 12:54.816
Anna, come on!

12:56.718 --> 12:58.220
Christ!

12:58.253 --> 12:59.755
Anna, I've been
shouting your name!

13:00.756 --> 13:01.690
Didn't you hear me?

13:02.892 --> 13:04.192
Oh, I guess I didn't.

13:04.226 --> 13:04.860
No?

13:06.561 --> 13:07.629
What is that?

13:07.663 --> 13:08.931
I feel comfortable with you,

13:08.965 --> 13:11.333
so I hope I can
tell you anything.

13:11.366 --> 13:12.434
Yeah?

13:12.467 --> 13:13.368
Like what?

13:13.402 --> 13:14.503
I feel something here.

13:17.873 --> 13:18.774
A presence.

13:18.807 --> 13:20.609
Oh man, cut the crap.

13:20.642 --> 13:23.578
You think I'm kidding,
but I'm receptive.

13:24.947 --> 13:26.448
Okay, good or bad?

13:28.684 --> 13:32.554
I don't know, or
I shouldn't say.

13:32.587 --> 13:34.656
Can you read my
mind right now?

13:34.690 --> 13:36.625
I have a pretty
good idea what you think.

13:36.658 --> 13:38.427
Yeah?

13:38.460 --> 13:39.861
Well I'm thinking that
you're acting fucking cuckoo.

13:39.896 --> 13:40.897
You're an asshole.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.838
Wait.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.908
Wait Thomas, I know,
sometimes I'm too much.

13:53.009 --> 13:54.576
I tried to have an open mind.

13:55.510 --> 13:57.679
The trespassing, the graveyard.

13:59.347 --> 14:00.849
I've had it, I just
can't do this anymore.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.451
Thomas-

14:02.484 --> 14:03.518
- I'm gonna go grab the
rest of our stuff, okay?

14:03.552 --> 14:03.785
No, no, let's make a fire.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.022
What?

14:06.055 --> 14:07.255
Absolutely not.

14:07.289 --> 14:07.990
Why not?

14:08.024 --> 14:08.991
No one would notice.

14:09.025 --> 14:09.926
It's illegal.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.359
Thomas, sit down.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.729
Sit down, okay?

14:13.762 --> 14:15.664
Relax a little, okay?

14:15.697 --> 14:17.766
When do you ever get to
just let go a little?

14:17.799 --> 14:19.501
That's all we're doing, right?

14:21.904 --> 14:22.972
Hang on, hang on.

14:23.005 --> 14:23.872
I'm feeling a little-

14:23.906 --> 14:25.373
- Thomas, kiss me.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.808
I'm feeling a
little not right.

14:26.842 --> 14:28.543
I need to sit down and breathe.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.278
Are you all right?

14:30.312 --> 14:31.580
I'm feeling a little not good.

14:58.007 --> 14:59.608
It's happening again.

15:01.077 --> 15:02.444
I can hear it.

15:03.512 --> 15:05.547
I can hear it calling me.

16:00.136 --> 16:01.369
Hi.

16:01.403 --> 16:03.438
I'd given up hearing from you.

16:03.471 --> 16:06.408
Oh, how's Philly, how's
your sister and Brian?

16:06.441 --> 16:07.843
They're fine.

16:07.877 --> 16:09.845
No, it's actually been
a really good trip.

16:09.879 --> 16:12.081
Oh, Mandy wanted to know
if you'd Skype with her.

16:12.114 --> 16:13.015
Okay, I will.

16:13.049 --> 16:14.116
All right, I love you.

16:14.150 --> 16:15.617
Love you, gotta go.

16:19.654 --> 16:20.589
Hey Dad.

16:20.622 --> 16:21.991
Hey honey.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.625
I'm kinda jealous
you're in the city.

16:23.658 --> 16:26.795
Look, I got that
bracelet you gave me.

16:26.828 --> 16:28.898
I'm working on my
science fair project.

16:28.931 --> 16:30.732
I ran out of time to do that.

16:30.765 --> 16:32.467
I see.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.970
Please don't lecture
me about time management,

16:34.003 --> 16:36.471
because Mom already did that.

16:36.504 --> 16:37.639
I gotta meet Jen.

16:37.672 --> 16:38.773
Chat soon?

16:38.807 --> 16:39.641
Bye.

16:40.742 --> 16:41.576
Oh well.

17:02.932 --> 17:04.665
Here to see Dr.
Winters, right?

17:04.699 --> 17:05.935
Yep, he said
he'd leave me a key

17:05.968 --> 17:07.801
since I'm arriving so late.

17:07.836 --> 17:08.703
Night owl, eh?

17:08.737 --> 17:09.537
Yeah.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.040
Me too.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.773
He didn't mention anything
about a key, though.

17:12.807 --> 17:14.476
Ah, he said you have
one for the cleaning lady.

17:14.509 --> 17:15.777
Yes ma'am.

17:15.810 --> 17:17.612
Don't call me
ma'am, it's Anna.

17:17.646 --> 17:18.680
Here you go, Anna.

17:19.814 --> 17:21.050
Thank you.

17:47.809 --> 17:51.746
My mother used to say that
Central Park was a cemetery

17:51.780 --> 17:55.918
for broken hearts and broken
souls, called The Unrequited,

17:56.886 --> 17:58.820
and they don't rest in peace.

17:58.853 --> 18:00.189
She was one of them.

18:00.222 --> 18:01.790
Sarah Mae too.

18:01.823 --> 18:03.758
Her one wish for me was
that I never become one.

18:03.792 --> 18:08.563
Now that we're back together
again, her wish has come true.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.223
Some people have what
they don't deserve.

20:18.894 --> 20:19.895
What the hell are you doing?

20:19.929 --> 20:21.629
I'm calling the cops.

20:53.462 --> 20:54.263
Hey.

20:55.431 --> 20:56.966
How'd you get in here?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.102
I'm here so you can apologize.

21:01.237 --> 21:02.871
Apologize?

21:02.905 --> 21:04.206
What on Earth would I
have to apologize for?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.773
I'm the one who
woke up in the dark,

21:05.807 --> 21:07.276
and it was startling
to say the least.

21:07.309 --> 21:10.012
I don't know what you're
talking about, you left me.

21:10.045 --> 21:11.413
Oh, give me a break.

21:11.447 --> 21:13.015
Oh, no, no, no, you're
not sitting down.

21:13.048 --> 21:14.383
I want you to gather
up your stuff, okay?

21:14.416 --> 21:16.085
I don't have anything here.

21:16.118 --> 21:18.254
Well then gather up some
of Brenda's stuff you used.

21:18.287 --> 21:19.754
So you're already sick of me?

21:21.223 --> 21:22.424
Oh, oh, hey honey.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.859
How's Philly?

21:24.894 --> 21:26.128
I'm back.

21:26.162 --> 21:27.429
You know I have
patients on Sunday now.

21:27.463 --> 21:30.032
Sorry, I was
just concentrating.

21:31.267 --> 21:32.268
- Yeah!
- What's that noise?

21:32.301 --> 21:33.469
TV, the TV.

21:35.371 --> 21:38.240
So are you still thinking
about coming up here tonight?

21:38.274 --> 21:40.309
Oh, I wish, but I finally
got the dishwasher guy

21:40.342 --> 21:42.311
to come upstate early tomorrow.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.413
Maybe I can meet you after
your conference downtown.

21:44.446 --> 21:46.382
Well let's figure
that out later, okay?

21:46.415 --> 21:47.883
Oh.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.018
My next session's starting.

22:02.131 --> 22:03.865
Hey, you shouldn't get
into stuff like this.

22:03.899 --> 22:05.833
Mind your business, lady.

22:06.902 --> 22:07.970
Hey, oh my god!

22:39.301 --> 22:40.102
Hey.

22:42.837 --> 22:43.738
Are you all right?

22:46.808 --> 22:47.910
I like your elephant.

22:52.948 --> 22:54.083
You can talk to me if you want.

22:54.116 --> 22:57.019
My mom's just not good.

23:04.526 --> 23:05.394
You want a hug?

23:12.468 --> 23:13.535
I gotta go.

23:18.040 --> 23:18.873
Bye.

23:37.293 --> 23:38.127
Yes Mom.

23:39.194 --> 23:40.062
Yes Mom.

24:18.133 --> 24:20.135
Dearest beloved,

24:20.169 --> 24:21.937
it's happening again.

24:23.272 --> 24:25.074
The ground is calling me.

25:23.198 --> 25:24.500
Anna.

25:24.533 --> 25:26.168
Hey, I have to
ask you something.

25:26.201 --> 25:28.404
I've not
seen you in centuries.

25:28.437 --> 25:31.240
You let the last man go
and the one before that.

25:31.273 --> 25:33.075
You don't follow
through with the ritual.

25:33.108 --> 25:34.443
Why does it have to be Thomas?

25:34.476 --> 25:36.712
Can't I just have a
baby with any guy?

25:36.745 --> 25:38.447
You
remember nothing!

25:38.480 --> 25:41.250
You began the ritual
with Thomas a year ago,

25:42.351 --> 25:44.219
when the Unrequited
Constellation

25:44.253 --> 25:46.355
was aligned with the Black Moon.

25:46.388 --> 25:49.491
So now your curse can only
be lifted by a new life.

25:49.525 --> 25:51.293
- A baby?
- Yes.

25:51.326 --> 25:53.195
Or you could
sacrifice a young virgin,

25:53.228 --> 25:54.663
which I'm sure
you're not up for.

25:55.531 --> 25:57.466
Okay, so I'll
complete it with Thomas,

25:57.499 --> 25:59.168
I'll do it this time.

25:59.201 --> 26:00.469
Nah, you will
be so soft and let him go.

26:00.502 --> 26:02.504
Thanks for your
words of encouragement.

26:07.476 --> 26:10.179
Hey, it's Anna,
your old patient.

26:11.380 --> 26:13.215
I was wondering if
I could come back.

26:15.417 --> 26:17.085
I feel like only
you can help me.

26:32.234 --> 26:35.237
One night, my mother was
really drunk and popping pills.

26:36.238 --> 26:39.675
She convinced herself that
some of Sarah Mae's suggestions

26:39.708 --> 26:43.512
would work on Phillip,
this guy she loved.

26:45.314 --> 26:49.485
After many drinks, they
headed into the park.

26:52.621 --> 26:54.456
I knew what she was doing.

26:54.490 --> 26:59.328
It was what Sarah Mae wrote
about, a spell, black magic.

26:59.361 --> 27:03.699
At first, the spell seemed to
work, because he'd loved her.

27:03.732 --> 27:06.401
I figured I'd head home.

27:06.435 --> 27:08.604
I was pushed from behind.

27:09.771 --> 27:11.740
It was Phillip,
he had the knife.

27:13.475 --> 27:17.513
He said if I did what
he said, I'd be okay.

27:18.747 --> 27:22.284
I saw the world of
dark, and I entered it.

27:23.585 --> 27:25.220
You see me as a bad person.

27:25.254 --> 27:26.255
You're projecting.

27:28.423 --> 27:29.291
How old were you?

27:32.294 --> 27:33.128
12.

27:36.098 --> 27:37.733
Well, I have
something you don't.

27:39.568 --> 27:42.671
Broken people have a
strength you'll never touch.

28:13.135 --> 28:15.103
No, the conference
is an all day event.

28:16.471 --> 28:17.472
Ah, fuck.

28:17.506 --> 28:19.541
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

28:19.575 --> 28:21.343
Tuesday, yeah, Tuesday, bye.

28:24.513 --> 28:26.181
Hey, did I miss a call from you?

28:26.214 --> 28:28.216
Yeah, your
girlfriend was here.

28:28.250 --> 28:29.818
Excuse me, I'm married.

28:29.851 --> 28:31.486
Anyways, I
didn't know if you were home.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.354
She left.

28:39.261 --> 28:40.562
Hey Vincent.

28:40.596 --> 28:41.863
As a doorman,
it's my job to keep

28:41.898 --> 28:42.798
everyone's business
to themselves.

28:42.831 --> 28:44.333
I appreciate that.

28:44.366 --> 28:45.567
Do you still have
season tickets?

28:46.535 --> 28:47.836
Yes I do.

28:47.869 --> 28:49.371
My nephew's
birthday's coming up.

28:50.772 --> 28:51.607
Oh.

28:54.343 --> 28:55.744
I see.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.612
Thanks.

28:58.413 --> 28:59.548
Hey.

28:59.581 --> 29:00.415
Hey.

29:00.449 --> 29:01.817
Yeah.

29:01.850 --> 29:04.386
Hey, I don't like how
I just ran out earlier,

29:04.419 --> 29:06.455
so I just wanted to
say a proper goodbye,

29:06.488 --> 29:08.590
because that seems
to be what you want.

29:08.624 --> 29:10.459
Okay, thanks, I appreciate it.

29:10.492 --> 29:11.793
Wait, wait!

29:11.827 --> 29:13.195
What?

29:13.228 --> 29:14.796
So goodbye?

29:14.830 --> 29:15.631
Goodbye, Anna.

29:15.664 --> 29:17.499
No, no, no.

29:17.532 --> 29:18.634
We should at least have a
walk in the park or something.

29:18.667 --> 29:19.801
- A last one.
- No, no, I-

29:19.835 --> 29:20.669
Thomas!

29:21.870 --> 29:23.906
It's gotta be quick,
let's go, come on.

29:26.341 --> 29:27.709
It's so gorgeous out tonight.

29:31.948 --> 29:33.548
Oh Thomas, I love this spot.

29:33.582 --> 29:34.583
What?

29:34.616 --> 29:35.584
I love this.

29:43.692 --> 29:44.526
Yeah.

29:48.764 --> 29:51.566
- It looks great, yeah.
- Yeah.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.536
Yeah.

29:54.569 --> 29:55.938
Do you hear that?

29:55.972 --> 29:56.939
What?

29:56.973 --> 29:57.806
What?

30:00.977 --> 30:01.810
Anna.

30:02.912 --> 30:03.779
I didn't hear it.

30:04.881 --> 30:06.348
I don't see anything you see,

30:06.381 --> 30:08.850
and I don't hear
anything you hear.

30:08.885 --> 30:10.452
I never have, okay?

30:11.553 --> 30:14.656
So, goodbye.

30:14.690 --> 30:15.557
Goodbye, Anna.

30:17.759 --> 30:18.593
Thomas!

30:24.033 --> 30:27.669
I knew he was back to
prescribing pills for himself,

30:27.703 --> 30:29.604
mixed with intense drinking.

30:30.907 --> 30:32.774
The sweats, the behavior.

30:33.842 --> 30:35.477
After all, I knew him.

30:36.678 --> 30:37.746
I knew him very well.

30:40.983 --> 30:41.984
Thomas!

30:45.587 --> 30:46.555
You can't just leave me.

31:05.407 --> 31:06.641
Hey, hey.

31:06.675 --> 31:08.844
I'm her boyfriend, okay guys?

31:08.878 --> 31:09.778
Is she okay?

31:09.811 --> 31:10.679
Yeah, she's fine.

31:10.712 --> 31:11.981
I'm her boyfriend.

31:12.014 --> 31:12.949
She has these episodes,
I'm her boyfriend

31:12.982 --> 31:14.616
and her doctor, okay?

31:14.649 --> 31:15.952
You want us to call
the police or anything?

31:15.985 --> 31:17.452
Oh, that's not
necessary, it really isn't,

31:17.486 --> 31:18.520
it really isn't.

31:18.553 --> 31:19.855
It looks a lot worse than it is.

31:19.889 --> 31:20.890
Hey honey.

31:20.923 --> 31:21.690
I'm her doctor, you guys.

31:21.723 --> 31:23.358
Okay, thank you.

31:23.391 --> 31:25.794
One, two, and three.

31:26.795 --> 31:27.562
Okay, we did it.

31:27.596 --> 31:29.065
You okay?

31:29.098 --> 31:30.933
All right, let me
get your purse.

31:30.967 --> 31:33.368
No, no, no, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

31:33.401 --> 31:34.436
It's gonna be fine.

31:34.469 --> 31:35.370
Let's go now, let's go home.

31:35.403 --> 31:36.705
All right, ready?

31:36.738 --> 31:37.539
Thanks, you guys!

31:41.710 --> 31:43.712
I don't know what
happened out there.

31:43.745 --> 31:45.547
I'll tell you
after I rest more.

32:10.872 --> 32:13.708
You asked who my
ancestor Sarah Mae was.

32:13.742 --> 32:17.679
She'd been thrown out of Ireland
for doing spells and magic,

32:17.712 --> 32:19.748
and even though her
country was in the middle

32:19.781 --> 32:21.918
of the great potato famine,

32:21.951 --> 32:23.418
her town bought her a ticket

32:23.451 --> 32:25.320
to the new world
on a coffin ship.

32:26.688 --> 32:29.558
Called that because so
many people died aboard.

32:29.591 --> 32:33.062
Sarah Mae found her
way to Seneca Village,

32:33.095 --> 32:36.364
the village they destroyed
to build Central Park.

32:36.398 --> 32:38.767
There were schools, churches.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.670
History doesn't mention the
darker side of the village.

32:41.703 --> 32:44.739
Here Sarah Mae met her people,

32:44.773 --> 32:46.808
West Africans who
taught her voodoo,

32:46.842 --> 32:49.045
which she really made her own.

32:49.078 --> 32:52.081
They worshiped, they prayed.

32:52.114 --> 32:53.883
I won't tell you
who they prayed to.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.766
Thomas, kiss me.

33:11.800 --> 33:12.701
No.

33:12.734 --> 33:14.136
Kiss me.

33:14.170 --> 33:15.604
No.

33:15.637 --> 33:16.973
Tear me apart.

33:17.006 --> 33:17.839
Stop it.

33:24.881 --> 33:26.648
You shouldn't drink like that.

33:26.681 --> 33:27.716
What the hell do you care?

33:27.749 --> 33:28.850
You don't give a shit about me.

33:30.518 --> 33:32.088
Okay, so rest up and you
can leave in the morning.

33:32.121 --> 33:33.521
Well, if you want me to
go then, I'll just go now.

33:33.555 --> 33:34.689
Okay, if that's what you want.

33:34.723 --> 33:36.491
Nice.

33:36.524 --> 33:37.425
You know what-

33:37.459 --> 33:38.526
- You arrogant fuck.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.562
You know what, you win.

33:40.595 --> 33:41.898
That's it.

33:41.931 --> 33:43.933
Bitch, I'm done
with you, let's go.

33:43.966 --> 33:45.968
Uh-uh, I think
it's time we talk

33:46.002 --> 33:48.737
about the elephant in
the room, sit down.

33:48.770 --> 33:49.604
Okay.

33:51.773 --> 33:53.109
What would that be?

33:53.142 --> 33:54.476
The fact that we
both know it's time

33:54.509 --> 33:56.112
for you to leave Brenda.

33:56.145 --> 33:57.880
Thomas, I love you.

33:59.081 --> 34:00.782
Tell me you love me,
it'll probably feel good

34:00.815 --> 34:02.118
to get it out in the open.

34:04.053 --> 34:05.787
Come here.

34:05.820 --> 34:06.688
Come here.

34:13.896 --> 34:15.697
I will never love you.

34:16.665 --> 34:18.500
You told me.

34:18.533 --> 34:20.136
What woman would believe a
man who says year after year

34:20.168 --> 34:21.904
he's gonna leave his wife,
and he never does it?

34:21.938 --> 34:23.538
You said you wanted
to have a baby with me.

34:23.571 --> 34:25.840
That was a long
time ago, I was drunk!

34:25.873 --> 34:27.542
I could've had a life.

34:27.574 --> 34:28.978
A family.

34:29.011 --> 34:30.079
It's too late now.

34:31.179 --> 34:32.014
Bullshit.

34:32.982 --> 34:36.217
You'd make a horrible,
horrible fuckin' mother.

34:37.152 --> 34:38.920
Good to hear what
you really think of me.

34:38.955 --> 34:39.956
You need to get
the fuck outta here.

34:39.989 --> 34:41.190
Get the fuck outta here.

34:42.857 --> 34:43.858
Anyhow,

34:46.195 --> 34:47.795
we already performed the ritual.

34:49.664 --> 34:51.132
Or most of it, anyway.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.536
What the fuck
you talking about?

34:54.569 --> 34:58.707
Well, it was broken up, but
some of it was we made love,

34:59.841 --> 35:03.045
spun around, I
bundled the twigs.

35:05.881 --> 35:07.984
Oh, but you don't
believe in that stuff.

35:08.918 --> 35:11.753
You need to get
outta here, right now.

35:14.723 --> 35:15.623
Say you love me.

35:16.791 --> 35:18.493
Go to fuckin' hell.

35:21.796 --> 35:22.630
Okay.

35:24.833 --> 35:28.137
Fine, I'll get outta
your fucking life!

35:28.170 --> 35:33.175
Maybe you just want me to jump
outta this fucking window!

35:33.875 --> 35:34.709
Bye!

36:13.215 --> 36:15.084
Have you seen anyone?

36:15.117 --> 36:16.651
Oh, come on.

36:16.684 --> 36:18.187
Those season
tickets, I have 'em.

36:18.220 --> 36:20.923
You can have as many as you
fuckin' want, just tell me.

36:20.956 --> 36:22.091
Have you seen anyone?

36:23.359 --> 36:24.759
Thank you.

36:24.793 --> 36:26.661
And no, I haven't seen anyone.

36:28.998 --> 36:29.932
Thanks.

36:29.965 --> 36:31.599
Good night, Thomas.

36:31.633 --> 36:33.169
Good night.

36:56.959 --> 36:57.859
Thomas.

36:59.694 --> 37:01.863
The last thing I wanted
to do was hurt you,

37:02.932 --> 37:05.901
but it's still on the list.

37:11.407 --> 37:14.642
If I follow through with
the unnameable with you,

37:17.346 --> 37:18.881
you won't be my first.

37:22.017 --> 37:23.285
Are you nuts?

37:23.319 --> 37:25.988
I'm not going in
the park with you!

39:23.172 --> 39:26.008
My cat has never been
gone for that long before.

39:26.041 --> 39:27.343
It's been three weeks.

39:27.376 --> 39:32.348
There's a way, but
it's my premium service.

39:33.315 --> 39:34.749
Okay, that's fine.

39:36.585 --> 39:38.354
Whatever it is,
I'm willing to pay.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.401
Hi Thomas.

40:25.434 --> 40:26.368
Vincent, hey.

40:26.402 --> 40:28.137
Question.

40:28.170 --> 40:30.139
These security cameras are
all around the building?

40:30.172 --> 40:32.074
Who's in charge of those?

40:32.107 --> 40:33.108
Not me.

40:33.142 --> 40:34.009
No, not you?

40:34.043 --> 40:35.377
Who then?

40:35.411 --> 40:36.612
Well, it
used to be Hector.

40:36.645 --> 40:37.980
Hector.

40:38.013 --> 40:39.847
Who's Hector?

40:39.882 --> 40:41.250
I'm just gonna be straight
with you, the system broke.

40:41.283 --> 40:42.918
It was never replaced.

40:42.951 --> 40:44.453
The cameras are basically
just for show now.

40:46.455 --> 40:47.523
Really?

40:47.556 --> 40:49.191
So it's all bullshit?

40:49.224 --> 40:50.025
Pretty much.

40:50.059 --> 40:51.327
Okay, thanks.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.428
Anytime.

40:52.461 --> 40:53.929
Why are you still in the city?

40:53.962 --> 40:55.464
You'd be proud,
I was a speaker

40:55.497 --> 40:57.966
at the American Board of
Ophthalmology convention today.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.136
I'm like so sorry
I missed that.

41:01.170 --> 41:02.271
So how'd your
science project go?

41:03.138 --> 41:04.006
Mandy!

41:04.039 --> 41:05.074
Oh my god, Dad!

41:05.107 --> 41:06.442
What is going on with you?

41:06.475 --> 41:08.043
I just saw a figure
pass behind you.

41:08.077 --> 41:09.178
Don't joke around like that.

41:09.211 --> 41:10.579
Mandy, it's very immature.

41:10.612 --> 41:12.214
Dad, I wouldn't lie
to you, I promise.

41:12.247 --> 41:14.116
I've had it with
your schoolgirl pranks.

41:14.149 --> 41:15.250
I'm signing off.

41:17.186 --> 41:18.020
Bye bye.

41:24.526 --> 41:26.995
I like being out with
my beautiful wife.

41:27.029 --> 41:28.630
Give me a break.

41:28.664 --> 41:30.566
The only time you compliment
me is when you're wasted.

41:30.599 --> 41:32.167
Come on, I'll drive us upstate.

41:32.201 --> 41:33.135
No.

41:36.271 --> 41:37.139
Why are you drinking?

41:37.172 --> 41:38.507
What happened?

41:38.540 --> 41:41.043
Brenda, I'm having a
glass of wine, I'm fine.

41:42.511 --> 41:43.645
Bullshit.

41:43.679 --> 41:45.514
You never have just one.

41:45.547 --> 41:47.282
Come on.

41:47.316 --> 41:49.451
Look, aren't gonna ask
me how my speech was, hm?

41:49.485 --> 41:51.053
How was your day?

41:51.086 --> 41:56.024
Well, I got a message
from a former patient,

41:56.959 --> 41:58.093
wants to return to therapy.

41:58.127 --> 41:59.928
Oh, and?

41:59.962 --> 42:02.364
And we weren't very
successful a few years ago.

42:02.398 --> 42:04.233
I believe if a patient
reaches out for help,

42:04.266 --> 42:06.168
you should give him
a second chance.

42:07.035 --> 42:09.071
Anyone who thinks
that only someone else

42:09.104 --> 42:11.039
can save them is already lost.

42:12.274 --> 42:13.242
I can't believe
you just said that.

42:13.275 --> 42:14.276
I can't believe it.

42:14.309 --> 42:15.611
Why?

42:15.644 --> 42:17.346
Am I the only one
who can save you?

42:17.379 --> 42:19.982
I just realized, I can't
come upstate with you.

42:20.983 --> 42:22.484
Why?

42:22.518 --> 42:24.953
An emergency surgery
came up, for the morning.

42:26.622 --> 42:28.223
You sure you can do a surgery?

42:29.324 --> 42:31.026
Go upstate.

42:31.059 --> 42:31.960
I don't wanna leave you
when you're like this.

42:31.994 --> 42:33.195
I just wanna be alone.

42:34.496 --> 42:35.330
Please?

42:36.532 --> 42:38.233
You know what?

42:38.267 --> 42:39.101
Fine.

42:44.506 --> 42:45.507
Could I have another?

42:56.084 --> 42:58.220
You must think
about when we first met.

43:04.026 --> 43:05.394
Which one does your wife use?

43:07.262 --> 43:10.032
Look, it's three-three-three.

43:10.065 --> 43:11.333
Won't you pray with me?

43:11.366 --> 43:12.768
We should go in the park.

43:12.801 --> 43:14.369
It's amazing in the dark.

43:14.403 --> 43:16.438
I really wanna give
you my private tour.

43:16.472 --> 43:17.306
Come on.

43:21.743 --> 43:23.045
Follow me.

43:23.078 --> 43:24.246
There's a path back here.

43:30.285 --> 43:33.789
♪ Central Park ♪

43:33.822 --> 43:38.227
♪ Quiet and dark ♪

43:38.260 --> 43:42.130
♪ Circle the fire ♪

43:42.164 --> 43:44.766
♪ Come meet me ♪

43:44.800 --> 43:49.438
♪ When it's three-three-three ♪

44:14.696 --> 44:19.701
Come when I call.

44:37.419 --> 44:40.355
There are so many hidden
symbols in the park.

44:41.757 --> 44:44.359
The Unrequited can
read them, of course.

44:45.694 --> 44:47.563
Sarah Mae was very
close with one

44:47.596 --> 44:49.331
of the architects of the park.

44:50.499 --> 44:51.833
They worshiped together.

44:53.268 --> 44:54.336
I won't tell you which.

44:58.540 --> 45:03.345
I'm a part of a long,
powerful history.

45:08.383 --> 45:12.421
Lifting the Unrequited
Curse has steps.

45:12.454 --> 45:16.325
It starts simply,
ends rather badly.

45:16.358 --> 45:17.359
It's sort of a game.

45:18.293 --> 45:21.430
After all, isn't that
what you played with me?

45:21.463 --> 45:23.365
Or maybe it's more
like a puzzle.

46:01.503 --> 46:03.205
Remember when we
went to the fair?

46:04.706 --> 46:06.308
You won me a teddy bear.

46:07.709 --> 46:09.912
Oh, Thomas, I loved you.

46:19.488 --> 46:23.492
I want you to know I did
struggle with this decision.

46:24.894 --> 46:26.595
But if you
want to lift the curse

46:26.628 --> 46:29.431
and have a baby, it's
time to do the unnameable.

46:29.464 --> 46:31.466
It's Thomas's day of reckoning.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.201
I'd never do
anything like that.

46:38.473 --> 46:39.841
I'd been doing really good.

46:42.945 --> 46:44.646
Okay, fine.

46:44.680 --> 46:45.514
Your way.

47:05.500 --> 47:07.469
Beloved, I call thee.

47:08.938 --> 47:11.640
Ye heart that longs and yearns.

47:11.673 --> 47:14.810
Love unrequited, twice burns.

47:14.843 --> 47:17.947
Only sacrifice or new
life cures the pain.

47:19.314 --> 47:21.416
Then you return
to thyself again.

47:21.450 --> 47:23.285
Follow the dark
towards eternity.

47:24.419 --> 47:26.488
Listen, the ground
is calling me.

47:26.521 --> 47:28.623
The ground is calling me.

48:21.810 --> 48:23.512
Got it.

48:40.829 --> 48:41.830
Thomas.

48:41.863 --> 48:42.864
- Hey.
- The usual?

48:44.901 --> 48:47.669
Tommy boy,
so great to see you.

48:47.702 --> 48:49.571
Hey, retirement is fabulous.

48:50.806 --> 48:53.642
Sometimes Eddie lets
me watch the news here

48:53.675 --> 48:54.576
instead of at home.

48:59.681 --> 49:00.582
What is it?

49:01.616 --> 49:03.019
Start from the beginning.

49:03.052 --> 49:06.688
Eddie, can you turn
the news down, please?

49:06.721 --> 49:07.556
My hearing.

49:08.623 --> 49:09.791
George, can I trust you?

49:09.825 --> 49:10.759
Absolutely.

49:11.726 --> 49:13.461
I fucked up.

49:13.495 --> 49:14.763
I mean, at your retirement
party, I met this girl.

49:14.796 --> 49:16.865
And I thought it
was only gonna be

49:16.899 --> 49:19.768
like a one night thing, but
it's continued, you know.

49:19.801 --> 49:20.903
She won't stop calling me-

49:21.870 --> 49:23.139
- Doctor, hold on.

49:23.172 --> 49:25.107
I need something stronger.

49:28.543 --> 49:29.444
You fucked up, Tommy.

49:29.477 --> 49:30.545
I did.

49:30.579 --> 49:31.780
Yeah.

49:31.813 --> 49:33.049
Now listen to me clearly.

49:34.150 --> 49:35.717
If you wanna save your marriage-

49:35.750 --> 49:38.087
- I do.
- Mea culpa, mea culpa.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.821
Tell Brenda now.

49:39.855 --> 49:40.755
I don't think I can.

49:40.789 --> 49:42.691
Fuck your ego, Tommy.

49:44.826 --> 49:46.795
You could lose everything.

49:46.828 --> 49:48.130
Okay.

49:48.164 --> 49:49.431
I'm gonna tell her.

49:56.105 --> 49:58.773
Hey, your girlfriend, I mean
your blonde friend was here.

49:58.807 --> 50:01.376
She said she'll meet you
at the pond at 11 p.m.

50:02.644 --> 50:04.446
What?

50:04.479 --> 50:05.647
She said meet her at the
pond at 11 p.m., as planned.

50:06.883 --> 50:07.816
Okay, thanks.

50:07.849 --> 50:08.717
Thank you, Vincent.

50:08.750 --> 50:10.119
You're welcome.

52:03.565 --> 52:05.767
Hi, it's Thomas.

52:08.037 --> 52:10.139
I'm not feeling
well, I have the flu.

52:10.172 --> 52:13.009
Would you have Roberts
take my calls today?

52:13.042 --> 52:15.311
I'm sure I'll feel
better tomorrow, thanks.

52:15.344 --> 52:16.178
Bye.

53:30.219 --> 53:32.121
Wow, I'm just in my
own world, I guess.

53:32.154 --> 53:35.057
Yeah, exactly why I thought
I'd come and see you tonight.

53:35.091 --> 53:37.993
I have a few
appointments tomorrow.

53:38.027 --> 53:40.029
I thought you'd
appreciate the company.

53:40.062 --> 53:42.264
That's great, honey.

53:42.298 --> 53:43.332
I haven't been drinking.

53:45.334 --> 53:49.704
I'm your wife, I'm not your
babysitter or your sponsor.

53:49.737 --> 53:51.073
I know.

53:51.107 --> 53:52.174
I know.

53:52.208 --> 53:53.042
Listen.

53:54.276 --> 53:55.777
I'm sorry about the other night.

53:55.810 --> 53:57.880
I'm starting at day
one again, okay?

53:57.913 --> 53:58.981
I'm glad to hear it.

54:03.919 --> 54:05.221
Oh, how'd those get so dirty?

54:06.989 --> 54:09.058
I wasn't wearing 'em.

54:09.091 --> 54:10.993
Certainly not my style.

54:18.300 --> 54:21.137
You know, Mandy called
me in an absolute fright

54:21.170 --> 54:23.038
about your Skype
call the other night.

54:24.106 --> 54:25.908
She was pranking me.

54:27.109 --> 54:28.444
I'm just not tolerating
that kind of thing.

54:28.477 --> 54:30.745
I don't think she'd do that.

54:30.778 --> 54:31.914
She's a teenager now.

54:33.282 --> 54:34.116
And?

54:35.850 --> 54:37.219
I don't know.

54:37.253 --> 54:40.222
Thomas, she sounded
really frightened.

55:13.189 --> 55:14.056
Kiss me.

55:16.458 --> 55:18.060
Tear me apart.

55:41.217 --> 55:42.952
The heart that longs and yearns,

55:42.985 --> 55:44.386
love unrequited twice burns.

55:44.420 --> 55:47.089
Only sacrifice or new
life cures the pain.

55:47.122 --> 55:48.790
Then you return to thyself.

55:48.823 --> 55:50.125
Follow the dark
towards eternity.

55:50.159 --> 55:52.860
Listen, the ground
is calling thee.

55:58.100 --> 56:00.302
Follow the dark,
follow the dark.

56:00.336 --> 56:02.770
Only sacrifice or new life.

56:06.342 --> 56:08.510
Shh, you'll wake the baby.

56:19.955 --> 56:21.156
Thomas.

56:21.190 --> 56:22.358
What's wrong?

56:22.391 --> 56:24.426
I had a nightmare.

56:28.830 --> 56:31.533
Jesus, I'll get
you some aspirin.

56:45.247 --> 56:46.248
What's this?

56:48.450 --> 56:50.052
It's a little trinket I found.

56:50.085 --> 56:52.221
I thought you'd like it.

56:53.622 --> 56:55.124
I like
your wrapping paper.

56:57.259 --> 56:58.394
It reminds me of something.

57:02.864 --> 57:04.333
Let's just try to
get some sleep.

57:14.209 --> 57:16.178
Hello.

57:16.211 --> 57:18.914
You're still in bed?

57:18.947 --> 57:20.316
I'm catching up on some rest.

57:20.349 --> 57:22.084
Well, you
probably needed it.

57:22.117 --> 57:23.919
Most of the night you were
shouting bloody murder.

57:23.952 --> 57:25.287
I had some intense nightmares.

57:25.321 --> 57:27.222
What do you
think brought these on?

57:28.490 --> 57:29.625
Don't shrink me.

57:29.658 --> 57:31.460
I wasn't.

57:31.493 --> 57:33.929
Well, get your lazy
bones out of bed.

57:33.962 --> 57:35.597
I'm getting up.

57:35.631 --> 57:37.232
You're finally
coming upstate tonight, right?

57:37.266 --> 57:39.201
Yeah, yes, this evening.

57:39.234 --> 57:41.970
Okay, love you.

58:04.026 --> 58:05.594
Hey, excuse me.

58:05.627 --> 58:07.129
Oh, no, I was just wondering
when the church is open?

58:07.162 --> 58:08.564
The church?

58:08.597 --> 58:10.065
They turn this
building into condos now.

58:10.099 --> 58:10.899
Really?

58:10.933 --> 58:12.000
Yeah.

58:12.034 --> 58:13.001
Where were you all this time?

58:13.035 --> 58:14.303
I wanted to see a priest.

58:15.170 --> 58:16.238
Can't help ya.

58:16.271 --> 58:17.272
They're not good anyhow.

58:17.306 --> 58:18.140
No?

58:19.341 --> 58:20.309
Nobody is, right?

58:23.078 --> 58:24.613
Hey.

58:24.646 --> 58:26.648
Mom says you think I was
playing a trick on you.

58:26.682 --> 58:28.550
Not true.

58:28.584 --> 58:30.185
I'm happy to see my
beautiful daughter.

58:30.219 --> 58:32.187
That's not an apology.

Hello, I'm
calling about your services.

01:00:52.127 --> 01:00:53.529
This is Sarah Mae.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.302
Shall we begin?

01:01:00.335 --> 01:01:01.770
Yes.

01:01:01.803 --> 01:01:03.272
Are
there any spirits

01:01:03.305 --> 01:01:05.641
who would like to
speak to Thomas?

01:01:06.842 --> 01:01:07.676
Anna!

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:15.150
I'm not getting anything.

01:01:15.851 --> 01:01:19.187
Okay, so what do we do now?

01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:21.857
We should leave.

01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:22.758
Already?

01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:24.326
Yes.

01:01:24.359 --> 01:01:25.661
Okay.

01:01:25.694 --> 01:01:26.495
Okay.

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.165
I'm
sorry, these things

01:01:30.198 --> 01:01:32.267
are not an exact science.

01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:35.404
Yeah, maybe it was all,
you know, just in my head.

01:01:47.816 --> 01:01:49.318
Do you promise not to yell?

01:01:49.351 --> 01:01:50.719
Okay.

01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:51.888
So I remembered
what my mother buried.

01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:53.322
Can you guess?

01:01:53.355 --> 01:01:54.623
A body?

01:01:54.656 --> 01:01:55.624
Whose?

01:01:55.657 --> 01:01:57.259
Why?

01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.093
I've no idea.

01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:02.397
Well, you have time
to think about it.

01:02:03.665 --> 01:02:04.766
A little time, anyway.

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.270
You think you're gonna
actually dig a grave?

01:02:09.838 --> 01:02:11.406
What are you doing?

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.508
Nothing you could
possibly understand.

01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:14.843
Untie me.

01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:16.378
Let me go, please.

01:02:17.346 --> 01:02:19.514
Your voice is getting
too loud for my taste.

01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:23.118
Anyway.

01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:25.354
Hey.

01:02:26.388 --> 01:02:27.689
It was great seeing you again.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.493
Now you can do whatever
you wanna do to me.

01:02:31.526 --> 01:02:32.494
I intend to.

01:02:32.527 --> 01:02:33.795
I don't need your approval.

01:02:35.497 --> 01:02:37.733
But I just want you
to know something, Anna,

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.402
I always cared about you.

01:02:41.536 --> 01:02:42.604
Always.

01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:44.439
It wasn't just a front for me.

01:02:49.378 --> 01:02:50.812
You're just saying that now.

01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:55.417
But when I first met you,
I knew you were special.

01:02:56.518 --> 01:02:57.386
Special how?

01:02:58.253 --> 01:02:59.521
That you
were the one for me.

01:02:59.554 --> 01:03:01.256
That it was my destiny.

01:03:03.859 --> 01:03:05.594
You don't believe
in that stuff.

01:03:05.627 --> 01:03:06.695
I believe in us.

01:03:08.563 --> 01:03:09.431
Do you mean that?

01:03:10.499 --> 01:03:11.366
Yes, I do.

01:03:12.401 --> 01:03:14.904
I'm a really great person
once you get to know me.

01:03:14.937 --> 01:03:15.938
I know that, Anna.

01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:21.777
I will leave Brenda
like I promised you.

01:03:22.778 --> 01:03:24.646
We'll have a big fancy
dinner tomorrow night

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.248
at your favorite spot.

01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:27.549
Wear a dress.

01:03:27.582 --> 01:03:29.384
Although you always look pretty.

01:03:32.254 --> 01:03:33.221
Untie me, please.

01:03:35.657 --> 01:03:36.491
Untie me.

01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:39.795
Can I just come
home with you tonight?

01:03:41.396 --> 01:03:43.532
No, I
wanna do this right.

01:03:43.565 --> 01:03:44.833
Tomorrow night, where?

01:03:44.866 --> 01:03:47.469
Chez Jean Pierre, 7:00 p.m.

01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:50.472
Hey, hey, don't follow me.

01:03:50.505 --> 01:03:51.740
Go before I change my mind.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.481
I have a date.

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:02.617
Something to take the edge off?

01:04:04.987 --> 01:04:08.590
Once you told me that
if I wish upon a star,

01:04:10.692 --> 01:04:12.260
I'm millions of years too late.

01:04:16.966 --> 01:04:19.568
This one's on me.

01:04:22.537 --> 01:04:24.506
This is war, my dear.

01:04:27.043 --> 01:04:27.876
And Mandy.

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:42.657
Yes, I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:05:07.582 --> 01:05:11.720
Thomas, I just
wanted to make sure

01:05:11.753 --> 01:05:14.322
you weren't running
late or something.

01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:15.824
Call me.

01:05:17.459 --> 01:05:19.028
Don't you
remember what I told you?

01:05:19.061 --> 01:05:22.731
So now your curse can only
be lifted by a new life.

01:05:22.764 --> 01:05:24.533
- A baby?
- Yes.

01:05:24.566 --> 01:05:25.935
Or you could
sacrifice a young virgin,

01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:28.070
which I'm sure
you're not up for.

01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:43.652
Oh, thank god you're here.

01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:45.387
Don't!

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:46.755
I've not been feeling well.

01:05:46.788 --> 01:05:48.557
I figured out who
this belonged to.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.525
It's a pretty sick gift, Thomas.

01:05:50.559 --> 01:05:52.094
I'm sorry.

01:05:52.128 --> 01:05:53.029
I don't even know who
the hell you are anymore.

01:05:56.098 --> 01:05:57.866
I'm ashamed to be
married to someone

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.669
who's attracted to such a
terribly disturbed person.

01:06:00.702 --> 01:06:03.405
Brenda, I'm so, so sorry.

01:06:03.438 --> 01:06:06.108
She was a client of
mine two years ago.

01:06:06.142 --> 01:06:07.642
I had no idea.

01:06:07.676 --> 01:06:09.111
Well she did.

01:06:09.145 --> 01:06:11.413
Anna was enraged when
I ended our sessions.

01:06:11.446 --> 01:06:12.781
I told her she had
to stop drinking

01:06:12.814 --> 01:06:13.883
if she wanted our
therapy to continue,

01:06:13.916 --> 01:06:15.517
and I knew that she couldn't.

01:06:16.418 --> 01:06:18.087
I hated our sessions.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.788
She believed she was a witch.

01:06:21.123 --> 01:06:22.591
Now that I do believe.

01:06:22.624 --> 01:06:23.893
You have clearly
fucking lost it!

01:06:23.926 --> 01:06:25.427
Brenda, I swear, I-

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.595
- I don't wanna
see you ever again.

01:06:27.997 --> 01:06:29.531
Let's talk, you tell
your patients to forgive.

01:06:29.564 --> 01:06:30.632
Oh, don't you dare!

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.002
Go to hell, Thomas.

01:06:33.035 --> 01:06:34.703
I need you, Brenda.

01:06:34.736 --> 01:06:36.105
Don't come near me.

01:06:37.173 --> 01:06:39.141
Just realized something.

01:06:39.175 --> 01:06:40.977
I'm free of you.

01:06:42.577 --> 01:06:44.713
Oh Brenda, please don't go!

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:32.895
Hello?

01:07:34.663 --> 01:07:35.463
Dad?

01:07:38.767 --> 01:07:39.601
Hey, Vincent.

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.538
Don't smoke.

01:07:43.571 --> 01:07:45.174
Have you seen my father?

01:07:45.207 --> 01:07:48.710
No, but he's been spending
a lot of time in the park.

01:07:48.743 --> 01:07:49.744
Okay.

01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:50.645
Well don't go there now.

01:07:50.679 --> 01:07:51.713
It's way too late.

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:09.731
Excuse me?

01:08:10.865 --> 01:08:14.836
Have you seen a man, 50 years
old, six feet, black hair?

01:08:17.238 --> 01:08:18.073
Sorry, no.

01:08:19.841 --> 01:08:22.743
Do you speak to spirits?

01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:25.081
Not always.

01:08:25.113 --> 01:08:26.781
I think my father
has some like

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:29.584
otherworldly things
happening to him.

01:08:29.617 --> 01:08:30.987
Your father is in great pain.

01:08:31.988 --> 01:08:33.990
Do you know
where I can find him?

01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:38.560
Yes, Thomas, Mandy came here.

01:08:38.593 --> 01:08:40.261
I think she went looking
for you in the park.

01:08:40.296 --> 01:08:41.563
Okay look, I need
you to go in the back

01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:42.831
and give me the gun back there.

01:08:42.863 --> 01:08:44.233
What?

01:08:44.265 --> 01:08:45.935
I don't have time for
this bullshit, Vincent.

01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:46.868
Go in the back and get me
that gun and give it to me.

01:08:46.902 --> 01:08:47.801
We got rid of it.

01:08:47.836 --> 01:08:49.205
You did?

01:08:49.238 --> 01:08:50.106
Fuckin' Christ.

01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:53.608
Oh, flashlight.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.276
Yeah.

01:09:08.224 --> 01:09:09.791
I'm so
glad I ran into you.

01:09:13.627 --> 01:09:15.898
I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.233
Okay.

01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:18.533
The ground
is calling you.

01:09:23.372 --> 01:09:25.807
Get away from me!

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:30.078
No, please!

01:09:30.112 --> 01:09:31.046
No, please.

01:09:45.995 --> 01:09:47.363
Walk around the candles.

01:09:47.395 --> 01:09:48.229
Please, no!

01:09:50.665 --> 01:09:52.935
You think about making
a run for it, you're done.

01:09:52.968 --> 01:09:53.801
Walk faster.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:58.873
Walk faster.

01:10:03.045 --> 01:10:03.878
Ow.

01:10:05.114 --> 01:10:06.949
I hurt my ankle.

01:10:06.982 --> 01:10:07.849
Please, help me.

01:10:11.887 --> 01:10:12.854
Ow.

01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:16.858
Please, help!

01:10:18.693 --> 01:10:20.062
Please, help.

01:10:20.096 --> 01:10:21.263
Okay.

01:10:21.297 --> 01:10:22.730
All right, I'll help you.

01:10:27.069 --> 01:10:28.971
Ow, my ankle.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.208
Use this as a crutch.

01:10:32.241 --> 01:10:33.909
Don't put any weight on it.

01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:35.010
Go.

01:10:35.044 --> 01:10:36.878
Go, and call your dad.

01:10:36.912 --> 01:10:37.880
Okay.

01:10:54.063 --> 01:10:54.863
Oh my god.

01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:10.246
When she hurt her
ankle, I had to help her.

01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:12.948
In the end I guess I
did the right thing.

01:11:12.982 --> 01:11:15.050
I'm a decent human being.

01:11:15.084 --> 01:11:16.051
Are you decent?

01:11:16.085 --> 01:11:18.820
Are you human?

01:11:18.853 --> 01:11:20.788
Either way, your curse remains.

01:12:10.439 --> 01:12:11.739
- Tom, Thomas?
- Hey.

01:12:11.773 --> 01:12:13.042
Hey.

01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:13.841
Can I give you
a hand with that?

01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:14.776
Oh no, no, no.

01:12:14.809 --> 01:12:16.145
No, I'm exercising.

01:12:16.178 --> 01:12:17.446
It's just heavy, you
don't wanna do it,

01:12:17.479 --> 01:12:18.746
you'll hurt your
back or something.

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.781
All right, Thomas.

01:12:19.814 --> 01:12:20.748
You have a nice evening.

01:12:20.782 --> 01:12:21.417
You too.

01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:53.015
Oh, fuck.

01:13:02.558 --> 01:13:03.926
Okay, come on.

01:13:19.174 --> 01:13:20.442
Hey Mandy, it's your father.

01:13:20.476 --> 01:13:22.144
I just got a missed
call from you,

01:13:22.177 --> 01:13:23.579
and I was hoping you'd call
me back as soon as you can

01:13:23.612 --> 01:13:25.414
and let me know that
you're okay, okay hon?

01:13:42.264 --> 01:13:44.600
No!

01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:45.467
Mandy.

01:13:49.271 --> 01:13:50.572
Forgive me, honey.

01:13:55.477 --> 01:13:56.612
Honey, I'm okay.

01:13:56.645 --> 01:14:01.283
I mean, oh.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.321
I need help.

01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:21.029
What did the
blonde say when she

01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:22.464
found out that she was pregnant?

01:15:24.099 --> 01:15:25.167
"Are you sure it's mine?"

01:15:37.346 --> 01:15:38.180
Hey.

01:15:41.316 --> 01:15:43.152
Get out of here.

01:15:43.185 --> 01:15:44.319
Get out of here!

01:20:02.477 --> 01:20:04.312
After several
months' investigation

01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:05.847
into the seven men
who have gone missing

01:20:05.882 --> 01:20:08.684
in Central Park's bramble,
a clue has emerged.

01:20:08.717 --> 01:20:11.520
Authorities have asked that
if you see anything like this,

01:20:11.553 --> 01:20:12.922
notify them immediately.

01:20:12.955 --> 01:20:13.923
Back to you.
