<i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.248 --> 00:05.505
<i>and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools</i>

00:05.507 --> 00:07.172
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.200 --> 00:10.251
Now, I'm using my knowledge
to help struggling

00:10.253 --> 00:13.311
small business owners make it
in this competitive world.

This is <i> Nathan for You.</i>

00:25.268 --> 00:29.020
<i>This is Mark Rappaport,
owner of Marky Sparky Toys.</i>

00:29.022 --> 00:30.722
<i>And of all the products
he's invented,</i>

00:30.724 --> 00:33.358
<i>one stands out as
the absolute worst.</i>

00:33.360 --> 00:36.903
The "Doinkit" is a strange ball
that doesn't do much.

00:36.914 --> 00:38.747
<i>And, unfortunately for Mark,
it hasn't been</i>

00:38.749 --> 00:40.081
<i>the biggest seller, either.</i>

00:40.522 --> 00:42.222
It's not all fun--
it's all fun and games--

00:42.287 --> 00:45.370
until nobody buys your toys.

00:45.372 --> 00:48.117
<i>But as far as I'm concerned,
the quality of the toy</i>

00:48.171 --> 00:50.542
<i>shouldn't matter,
when you're selling to kids.</i>

00:50.544 --> 00:52.276
<i>So I paid Mark a visit,
with a way to get</i>

00:52.334 --> 00:53.595
<i>those Doinkits sold.</i>

00:53.597 --> 00:56.014
When you're a kid,
what's the one thing you want,

00:56.016 --> 00:57.182
more than anything?

00:57.967 --> 00:59.301
Power.

00:59.303 --> 01:03.555
No.
To not be seen as a baby.

01:03.765 --> 01:05.681
<i>It's very easy
to market to kids,</i>

01:05.683 --> 01:07.850
<i>because their brains
are so small.</i>

01:07.852 --> 01:10.319
<i>So rather than selling a ball,
Mark should be selling</i>

01:10.321 --> 01:13.189
<i>an identity for children.
That identity?</i>

01:13.191 --> 01:15.608
<i>That owning a Doinkit
is the only way to prove</i>

01:15.610 --> 01:17.110
<i>you're not a baby.</i>

01:17.318 --> 01:18.984
No.
No.

01:18.986 --> 01:20.786
This is Marketing 101.

01:20.788 --> 01:22.404
A-- According to you.

01:22.406 --> 01:23.989
Well, that's what
sells products.

01:23.991 --> 01:28.460
Fantastic! Fantastic.
I am so excited.

01:28.462 --> 01:30.879
Am I sensing some sarcasm?

01:31.571 --> 01:32.638
Yes.

01:32.987 --> 01:35.560
Mark wasn't convinced,
and said there was only

01:35.586 --> 01:37.369
one thing that could
win him over.

01:37.504 --> 01:39.554
Cash. Money.

01:39.556 --> 01:41.840
<i>I needed to show
that this would be profitable.</i>

01:41.842 --> 01:44.309
<i>So later that week,
I arranged a focus group</i>

01:44.311 --> 01:47.262
<i>to see if my marketing approach
would work with actual children.</i>

01:47.264 --> 01:48.980
When I show this to you,
what do you think?

01:48.982 --> 01:50.565
- Do you want it?
- Nope.

01:50.567 --> 01:51.683
- Nah.
- No.

01:51.685 --> 01:52.768
Why?

01:52.770 --> 01:55.320
- Dumb.
- It's dumb?

01:55.322 --> 01:56.605
Yeah.

01:56.607 --> 01:59.658
Okay, uh, hold on a second,
guys.

01:59.660 --> 02:02.027
I just got a call.

02:02.029 --> 02:03.528
Hello?

02:03.530 --> 02:06.365
Oh, yes sir.
Really?

02:06.367 --> 02:09.334
Oh my god, yeah,
I'll let them know.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.787
Sorry, guys.
That was the President calling.

02:11.789 --> 02:14.756
And he just told me
that owning this toy

02:14.758 --> 02:18.820
is now the only proof
you're not a baby.

02:18.852 --> 02:21.102
Well, I mean, I have one.

02:21.104 --> 02:23.938
So that's good.
Are you guys babies? Or...

02:23.940 --> 02:25.607
- Nope.
- Nah.

02:25.609 --> 02:28.576
Well you don't have the toy,
so you must be a baby.

02:28.578 --> 02:34.449
Unless you have it,
then you're not.

02:34.451 --> 02:38.002
Oh, okay, so now...
You two aren't babies,

02:38.004 --> 02:43.791
but are you a baby?

02:43.793 --> 02:45.627
- Are you a baby?
- No.

02:45.629 --> 02:48.429
Well, you don't have the toy.

02:52.140 --> 02:54.845
What do you think about kids
that don't have the toy?

02:54.972 --> 02:56.354
- Mm, sad.
- Weird.

02:56.856 --> 02:58.189
- Sad?
- Weird.

02:58.191 --> 03:00.308
- Why?
- Because they're a baby.

03:00.310 --> 03:03.061
<i>The strategy worked
even better than I had hoped.</i>

03:03.063 --> 03:05.146
<i>So I rebranded
the toy's packaging</i>

03:05.148 --> 03:07.148
<i>and brought it to Mark,
to see what he thought.</i>

03:07.150 --> 03:08.983
It's horrible.

03:08.985 --> 03:11.152
I mean, what specifically?

03:11.154 --> 03:13.905
Uh, kid in a diaper?
With, um,

03:13.907 --> 03:15.707
children pointing at him?

03:15.709 --> 03:18.993
If this is the best you've got,
you're awful.

03:18.995 --> 03:20.495
I mean,
I'm putting a lot of effort

03:20.497 --> 03:22.330
and resources into
trying to sell...

03:22.332 --> 03:23.414
- Well you're not...
- It's less--

03:23.416 --> 03:24.499
You're not good
at what you do.

03:24.501 --> 03:27.502
Um, you're not good
at what you do.

03:27.504 --> 03:29.420
<i>Working with Mark
was about as much fun</i>

03:29.422 --> 03:31.089
<i>as playing with his toys.</i>

03:31.091 --> 03:32.840
<i>But I was convinced
I could win him over</i>

03:32.842 --> 03:34.342
<i>if I showed him results.</i>

03:34.344 --> 03:37.061
<i>So I wrote and shot
a professional TV commercial</i>

03:37.063 --> 03:38.846
<i>for the Doinkit,
that was guaranteed</i>

03:38.848 --> 03:40.982
<i>to get kids to buy it.</i>

If you are between the ages
of three and eight,

03:53.163 --> 03:55.496
please listen closely.

03:55.498 --> 03:58.583
Owning a Doinkit
is now the only proof

03:58.585 --> 04:00.285
that you are not a baby.

04:00.287 --> 04:03.705
If you don't have this toy,

04:03.707 --> 04:05.290
People will think
you wear diapers,

04:05.292 --> 04:07.709
and cry all the time.

04:07.711 --> 04:10.378
Everybody will think
you sleep in a crib,

04:10.380 --> 04:13.264
and drink from a bottle,
if you don't have one of these.

04:14.768 --> 04:18.553
And whenever you speak,
all people will hear is,

04:18.555 --> 04:20.855
"Goo goo, ga ga."

04:21.839 --> 04:25.476
So tell your mom or dad
to buy you a Doinkit.

04:25.478 --> 04:28.780
Because otherwise,
as far as anyone's concerned,

04:28.782 --> 04:32.900
you're a baby.

04:32.902 --> 04:36.294
Oh, it can also be used
as a toy ball.

04:42.578 --> 04:45.713
Cut.
Nice.

04:45.715 --> 04:47.165
<i>It was perfect.</i>

04:47.167 --> 04:49.467
<i>But when I tried to buy ad time
on a local station,</i>

04:49.469 --> 04:53.421
<i>You're lying to the kids,
and saying that they're a baby</i>

04:53.423 --> 04:54.889
<i>if they don't have this toy.</i>

04:54.891 --> 04:57.809
<i>They said a commercial like
this would never make it on TV.</i>

04:57.811 --> 05:00.978
<i>And that meant,
I needed a new approach.</i>

05:00.980 --> 05:03.648
<i>So I convinced a local toy store
to carry the Doinkit,</i>

05:03.650 --> 05:06.934
<i>by offering to provide them
with a Santa, free of charge,</i>

05:06.936 --> 05:08.736
<i>for the approaching
holiday season.</i>

05:08.738 --> 05:11.522
<i>But what they didn't know,
is that Santa was my old pal,</i>

05:11.524 --> 05:14.242
<i>James Bailey,
who I could trust to make sure</i>

05:14.244 --> 05:17.829
<i>that every kid would be asking
for a Doinkit for Christmas.</i>

05:17.831 --> 05:21.282
<i>- And with James in place...</i>
- Santa!

05:21.284 --> 05:23.284
<i>it was time to sell
some Doinkits.</i>

05:23.286 --> 05:26.287
Do you know what you'd like
to have for Christmas?

05:26.289 --> 05:31.125
Um, I would really want
an <i>Ever after high</i> doll.

05:32.461 --> 05:37.432
Why? That-- That-- That tells me
that you must be a baby.

05:38.634 --> 05:40.685
- Are you a baby?
- No.

05:40.687 --> 05:43.187
See all these people
making fun of the boy?

05:43.189 --> 05:46.023
So, we don't want people
to think that you're a baby,

05:46.025 --> 05:48.142
and the only way
you can prove that,

05:48.144 --> 05:52.063
- is if you have a Doinkit toy.
- Okay.

05:52.065 --> 05:53.865
The plan was working great.

05:53.867 --> 05:56.401
- I need this, so...
- You're gonna get this?

05:56.403 --> 06:01.489
One of the girls that--
at my school, she's mean to me.

06:01.491 --> 06:05.493
She's mean to you?
Oh, that's not good.

06:05.495 --> 06:08.713
I wonder if that's because
she might think you're a baby,

06:08.715 --> 06:10.965
because you don't have
a Doinkit.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.836
Well, that must mean
you wear diapers.

06:14.838 --> 06:17.088
No, I don't wear diapers
anymore.

06:17.090 --> 06:19.590
'cause I don't wanna be a baby,
I said!

06:21.261 --> 06:22.844
Just doesn't seem
like something Santa should

06:22.846 --> 06:24.846
be saying, that kids
are gonna look like babies.

06:24.848 --> 06:26.981
Well that's,
that's your opinion.

06:26.983 --> 06:28.900
<i>Despite a couple
uptight parents,</i>

06:28.902 --> 06:31.436
<i>the Doinkit was
the top-selling toy of the day.</i>

06:31.438 --> 06:33.855
<i>But when I went back to Mark
with the good news,</i>

06:33.857 --> 06:35.606
<i>he still didn't get it.</i>

06:35.608 --> 06:38.359
That was horrible advice
and awful graphics,

06:38.361 --> 06:39.994
- terrible design...
- No, but it did work.

06:39.996 --> 06:41.746
- Unprofessional...
- Okay.

06:41.748 --> 06:43.364
You never proved
that it worked.

06:43.366 --> 06:45.366
We did get sales.

06:45.701 --> 06:48.252
<i>In life, not everyone
will see your vision.</i>

06:48.338 --> 06:51.455
<i>But it's important to always
take the high road.</i>

06:51.478 --> 06:53.562
<i>And sometimes the best way
to brighten spirits,</i>

06:53.626 --> 06:54.857
is with a gift.

06:56.317 --> 06:57.616
This is you.

06:57.764 --> 06:59.275
<i>But the biggest
difference between</i>

06:59.345 --> 07:02.016
<i>me and Mark,
is that when I play with toys,</i>

07:02.018 --> 07:03.684
<i>- I win.</i>
- <i>"Hi, I'm Marky.</i>

07:03.686 --> 07:07.722
<i>"I'm an idiot business man
with a small dick.</i>

07:07.724 --> 07:10.942
<i>"I have no idea how much
I hurt other people's feelings.</i>

07:10.944 --> 07:14.529
<i>"And I'm the laughingstock
of my industry."</i>

07:15.899 --> 07:17.055
<i>Last season on my show,</i>

07:17.136 --> 07:19.996
I helped a private investigator,
named Brian Wolfe,

07:20.047 --> 07:22.008
<i>by giving him a positive review
on Yelp.</i>

07:22.010 --> 07:24.624
I don't give a flying [bleep]
about Yelp, okay?

07:24.649 --> 07:26.565
<i>But when I recently visited
Brian,</i>

07:26.600 --> 07:28.459
<i>he told me something
that came as a shock.</i>

07:28.756 --> 07:31.044
When I was on your show,
um, I've received

07:31.046 --> 07:33.464
a lot of phone calls from
different production companies,

07:33.466 --> 07:36.333
and-- and personally, right now,
I have my own reality show.

07:36.335 --> 07:38.502
<i>It's true.
Brian got his own show</i>

07:38.504 --> 07:41.672
<i>on the Discovery Channel,
after I made him a star.</i>

07:41.674 --> 07:43.841
<i>But I got nothing
from this deal.</i>

07:43.843 --> 07:45.225
<i>So, worried that more people</i>

07:45.227 --> 07:47.118
<i>from my show would be poached
for their own</i>

07:47.150 --> 07:50.230
reality series, I went through
the entire first season,

07:50.232 --> 07:52.683
<i>to see if there were
any other potential candidates.</i>

07:52.685 --> 07:54.690
<i>And that's when I remembered
Simon,</i>

07:54.753 --> 07:58.021
<i>a professional security guard,
with one major weakness.</i>

07:58.023 --> 07:59.857
<i>Double "D" breasts
are essential for you?</i>

07:59.859 --> 08:02.025
<i>It's gotta be--
It's gotta be substantial.</i>

08:02.027 --> 08:03.861
<i>His story had all
the ingredients</i>

08:03.863 --> 08:05.496
<i>for a reality hit.</i>

08:05.498 --> 08:07.197
<i>So I called Simon
into my office,</i>

08:07.199 --> 08:09.116
<i>because if he was gonna get
his own series,</i>

08:09.118 --> 08:10.334
<i>I wanted to produce it.</i>

08:10.336 --> 08:12.085
So, Simon.

08:12.087 --> 08:14.955
How do you feel about
pitching a reality show

08:14.957 --> 08:18.041
- about you?
- Wow. That's pretty big.

08:18.043 --> 08:20.961
I would-- I would definitely
be interested in that.

08:20.963 --> 08:22.513
To me,
it's the perfect concept.

08:22.515 --> 08:24.848
You're a security guard
who's very good at his job,

08:24.850 --> 08:27.885
but there's only one thing
that distracts you.

08:27.887 --> 08:29.603
- Right.
- Which is?

08:29.605 --> 08:32.806
Uh, yeah. Girls with uh, big--
big, uh, breasts.

08:32.808 --> 08:34.475
<i>Simon was in.</i>

08:34.477 --> 08:35.859
<i>So we spent the next hour
coming up with some</i>

08:35.861 --> 08:38.145
<i>potential storylines
for our series.</i>

08:38.147 --> 08:40.030
Let's say a situation
where I was working security

08:40.032 --> 08:43.232
in a store, and, um,
a woman walked in, like,

08:43.235 --> 08:45.285
almost every day,
who was very pretty,

08:45.287 --> 08:46.653
but had small breasts.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.372
And then,
like maybe a week later,

08:48.374 --> 08:50.958
she walked in, um, and she had
uh, larger breasts.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.328
And I could tell that
she'd had implants, you know.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.079
That could be, that could be,
like one-- th-- one--

08:56.081 --> 08:57.320
That could be one show.

08:57.583 --> 09:00.634
You know an episode of TV
is a half an hour long, right?

09:00.636 --> 09:02.135
Right.

09:02.319 --> 09:03.470
Okay.

09:03.973 --> 09:05.839
<i>We brainstormed
a few more ideas,</i>

09:05.841 --> 09:08.342
<i>and after shooting
a short demo presentation,</i>

09:08.344 --> 09:10.286
<i>I set up a pitch meeting
with one of the biggest</i>

09:10.285 --> 09:12.095
<i>reality show producers
in the country,</i>

09:12.097 --> 09:13.514
<i>for later that week.</i>

09:13.516 --> 09:15.599
<i>So we'll check back with this
in a bit.</i>

09:15.601 --> 09:17.100
<i>But first...</i>

09:17.102 --> 09:19.903
<i>It's a tough time to be
in the movie theater biz.</i>

09:19.905 --> 09:21.905
<i>With most of the ticket sales
going to the people</i>

09:21.907 --> 09:23.490
<i>that make the movies,
theaters like</i>

09:23.492 --> 09:26.573
<i>Whittier Village Cinemas,
in Whittier, California,</i>

09:26.607 --> 09:29.196
<i>have to rely on snack sales
to scrape by.</i>

09:29.198 --> 09:30.753
The concession's where
you're gonna make money.

09:30.767 --> 09:32.082
that's all we are,
is one giant--

09:32.084 --> 09:34.117
A movie theater's just
one giant concession stand.

09:34.119 --> 09:36.954
<i>So I paid theater manager,
Erik Chaffino, a visit,</i>

09:36.956 --> 09:40.173
<i>with a simple way to instantly
double his profits.</i>

09:40.175 --> 09:43.260
It seems like, oftentimes,
one person will buy popcorn,

09:43.262 --> 09:45.262
- Uh-huh.
- and then two people

09:45.264 --> 09:46.263
will share it.

09:46.265 --> 09:47.548
Yeah.
Pretty much every--

09:47.550 --> 09:49.967
95% of the customers will share.

09:49.969 --> 09:52.135
<i>But not anymore.
The plan:</i>

09:52.137 --> 09:54.721
<i>force each customer to buy
their own concession item</i>

09:54.723 --> 09:57.558
<i>with a new rule:
no sharing allowed.</i>

09:57.560 --> 09:59.643
Hmm. Do you think
the customers are gonna treat--

09:59.645 --> 10:00.777
take that well?

10:00.779 --> 10:02.279
You know, if Edison
was worried about

10:02.281 --> 10:04.531
his candle customers,
he would have never

10:04.533 --> 10:07.117
- invented the light bulb.
- True, true.

10:07.119 --> 10:09.286
It takes a little bit of courage
to be the first one out there

10:09.288 --> 10:10.487
to change something, so...

10:10.489 --> 10:13.156
And this could be, kind of,
of that caliber.

10:13.158 --> 10:15.242
Yeah, like you said, uh,
Thomas Jefferson would,

10:15.244 --> 10:16.827
if he was caring about the--
his candle...

10:16.829 --> 10:18.495
- Edison.
- Edison, thank you.

10:18.497 --> 10:19.796
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Yeah, so, yeah...

10:19.798 --> 10:22.666
What Edison did
with the candles, you know?

10:22.668 --> 10:24.751
If he was afraid of that,
he wouldn't have invented,

10:24.753 --> 10:27.304
you know, light bulbs, and so...

10:27.306 --> 10:28.722
Right.

10:28.724 --> 10:31.842
<i>Erik was in. So the next day,
after prepping the staff,</i>

10:31.844 --> 10:33.810
<i>we put the new policy
into effect.</i>

10:33.812 --> 10:35.702
Can I have a small popcorn,
please?

10:35.796 --> 10:37.764
You guys can't be sharing,
so, do you guys want

10:37.766 --> 10:41.485
- two small popcorns?
- Shhh--uh, sure.

10:41.487 --> 10:43.770
<i>It seemed to be working,
as some people were</i>

10:43.772 --> 10:45.989
<i>adjusting their orders,
and buying a second item.</i>

10:45.991 --> 10:48.025
- One per each.
- Thank you.

10:48.027 --> 10:50.243
There you go, enjoy.
<i>But as more customers arrived,</i>

10:50.245 --> 10:52.412
<i>I became worried that people
were trying to get around</i>

10:52.414 --> 10:53.190
<i>the policy.</i>

10:54.199 --> 10:55.582
Okay.

10:55.584 --> 10:57.034
<i>And when I looked inside
the theater,</i>

10:57.036 --> 10:59.503
<i>my suspicions were confirmed.</i>

10:59.505 --> 11:01.204
<i>So I discreetly
had to remind people</i>

11:01.206 --> 11:03.707
<i>that they were in violation
of theater rules.</i>

11:03.709 --> 11:06.543
I'm sorry, we can't--
we can't have you sharing.

11:07.639 --> 11:08.817
I saw you sharing.

11:09.653 --> 11:11.048
I saw him take some.

11:13.636 --> 11:16.713
Did you have any? 'cause it's
all over your shirt, here...

11:19.224 --> 11:22.392
Okay, can I-- j--
I'm sorry, do you mind if I...

11:22.394 --> 11:25.362
smell your fingers?

11:25.364 --> 11:27.390
Okay, so it smells like popcorn?

11:29.451 --> 11:31.985
He did, so he did.
It's basically stealing

11:31.987 --> 11:33.153
from the theater,
when you do that.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.455
<i>It was too easy to cheat,</i>

11:35.457 --> 11:37.708
<i>and without a good way
to monitor what was going on</i>

11:37.710 --> 11:39.743
<i>inside the theater,
it was impossible</i>

11:39.745 --> 11:42.412
<i>for the no-sharing policy
to be enforced.</i>

11:42.414 --> 11:43.997
<i>So before the evening rush,</i>

11:43.999 --> 11:45.832
<i>I set up several
night-vision cameras</i>

11:45.834 --> 11:47.167
<i>at the front of the theater,</i>

11:47.169 --> 11:49.920
<i>enabling us to view any people
that decided to share</i>

11:49.922 --> 11:52.673
<i>from monitors I set up
in the back room.</i>

11:52.675 --> 11:55.258
<i>And while training the staff,
I learned that the cameras</i>

11:55.260 --> 11:58.311
<i>might be useful to the theater
for another purpose, as well.</i>

11:58.313 --> 12:00.897
It's usually, it's like older,
like, um, middle-aged men

12:00.899 --> 12:03.650
going to like a kid's movie
by themselves, late at night.

12:03.652 --> 12:05.602
But we've never actually, like,
caught somebody...

12:05.604 --> 12:07.437
- Oh, okay.
- Mid-process.

12:07.439 --> 12:09.406
So this could work
for popcorn-sharers.

12:09.408 --> 12:10.907
And-- And perverts.

12:10.909 --> 12:13.160
<i>I was happy it could serve
a dual purpose,</i>

12:13.162 --> 12:15.529
<i>but since all the camera angles
were currently set up</i>

12:15.531 --> 12:18.115
<i>to catch people sharing snacks,
I had Frank help me</i>

12:18.117 --> 12:20.450
<i>adjust the angles, to make sure
they could also spot</i>

12:20.452 --> 12:23.170
<i>theater perverts, no matter
where they were sitting.</i>

12:23.172 --> 12:24.454
A little higher up.

12:24.456 --> 12:26.173
<i>And as we perfected the camera's
vantage point,</i>

12:26.175 --> 12:29.960
<i>I got to know a little bit more
about this town I was in.</i>

12:29.962 --> 12:32.879
So what's life like in Whittier?

12:32.881 --> 12:35.015
There's a-- quite a few parks,
that are cool.

12:35.017 --> 12:38.719
Um, Ronald Reagan
went to high school here.

12:38.721 --> 12:41.471
College...
I think it has the most trees?

12:41.473 --> 12:44.641
In any city?
Variety of trees...

12:44.643 --> 12:46.560
Wow.
I didn't know that.

12:46.562 --> 12:48.311
<i>Once the cameras were all set,</i>

12:48.313 --> 12:50.113
<i>I got in place
for the next showing.</i>

12:50.115 --> 12:52.699
<i>And what I saw,
shocked me.</i>

12:52.701 --> 12:54.151
Share.
Boom.

12:54.153 --> 12:57.320
Gotcha.
That's premeditated sharing.

12:57.322 --> 13:00.157
They're just shameless.
They just keep doing it.

13:00.159 --> 13:03.910
It's just like no one is even--
everyone is sharing.

13:03.912 --> 13:06.296
<i>Knowing that this behavior
would only continue</i>

13:06.298 --> 13:07.998
<i>without some sort
of consequence,</i>

13:08.000 --> 13:09.499
<i>after the screening was over,</i>

13:09.501 --> 13:11.835
<i>I led two of the perpetrators
into the back room,</i>

13:11.837 --> 13:13.587
<i>to make an example of them.</i>

13:13.589 --> 13:16.560
Uh, this right here is our,
uh, monitoring system.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.541
- And you guys were sharing.
- Mm-hmm.

13:19.978 --> 13:21.762
Because of that,
that means you-- you have to

13:21.764 --> 13:24.347
- go up on the board.
- What board?

13:25.003 --> 13:27.434
- The...
- "popcorn sharing

13:27.436 --> 13:30.654
- and theaters... Uh-huh.
- This is a violations board.

13:30.656 --> 13:32.522
Well, I don't think...
I mean, we shared popcorn.

13:32.524 --> 13:34.185
- We weren't masturbating there.
- No.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.421
It's not you, that's for
when we catch someone else.

13:36.469 --> 13:38.333
Oh.
- We just have one board for both.

13:38.369 --> 13:40.363
Okay, well you need to make
two separate boards,

13:40.365 --> 13:42.249
'cause I ain't gonna be
a masturbator up there.

13:42.251 --> 13:44.868
These cork boards
are like $20.

13:44.870 --> 13:47.954
So, we'd have to buy two,
if it was for--

13:47.956 --> 13:49.384
and a separate one
for masturbators.

13:49.390 --> 13:51.371
- So we just made it one board.
- Well, you guys run a theater.

13:51.379 --> 13:53.122
You should be able to afford
two boards.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.711
Okay, thank you
for that feedback.

13:54.713 --> 13:56.046
- And we might take it in...
- Yeah.

13:56.048 --> 13:56.904
- to account.

13:56.932 --> 13:59.049
<i>With a punishment in place,
I was hopeful it would</i>

13:59.051 --> 14:01.718
<i>curb violators.
But the one thing I found out</i>

14:01.720 --> 14:04.721
<i>about Whittier, is that people
were just flat-out rude.</i>

14:04.723 --> 14:06.523
I don't mind being
on the board.

14:06.525 --> 14:08.763
Because I'll share, and share,
and share.

14:08.763 --> 14:09.703
<i>On top of that,</i>

14:09.736 --> 14:11.551
<i>when I finally showed Erik
the system,</i>

14:11.582 --> 14:13.548
<i>he wasn't as excited
as I had hoped.</i>

14:14.032 --> 14:16.233
May not be for this theater.
It may not be what we need.

14:16.235 --> 14:17.984
Okay.

14:17.986 --> 14:20.704
<i>It was a hard blow,
having two businesses reject</i>

14:20.706 --> 14:23.456
<i>my ideas in one week
made me sad.</i>

14:23.458 --> 14:25.792
<i>My only hope was that
my pitch with Simon</i>

14:25.794 --> 14:27.077
<i>would turn things around.</i>

14:28.924 --> 14:31.091
<i>It was the day
of our big pitch.</i>

14:31.093 --> 14:32.676
<i>And Simon and I
nervously waited</i>

14:32.678 --> 14:34.261
<i>in the lobby
for our meeting.</i>

14:34.263 --> 14:36.880
Before getting into the pitch,
it might be good to start off

14:36.882 --> 14:39.550
with, you know,
some Hollywood chitchat, or...

14:39.552 --> 14:41.718
- Right.
- Make 'em aware that you--

14:41.720 --> 14:44.304
- you know-- you know the industry.
- Yeah. A little small talk.

14:44.306 --> 14:45.773
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

14:45.775 --> 14:48.609
<i>With Simon prepped,
we met with reality TV producer</i>

14:48.611 --> 14:51.111
<i>Brant Pinvidic
to see if we could land a deal</i>

14:51.113 --> 14:53.113
<i>for our new reality show.</i>

14:53.115 --> 14:54.648
Do you remember that movie
<i>Captain Phillips?</i>

14:54.650 --> 14:56.066
I do.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.152
Yeah, I heard that the, uh,
Somali actor who played the, uh,

14:58.154 --> 14:59.820
who played the part
of one of the pirates,

14:59.822 --> 15:01.989
I heard that he's almost broke--
broke right now, so...

15:01.991 --> 15:03.479
- Tough.
- Yeah.

15:03.492 --> 15:04.561
- Tough business.
- Yeah, it is.

15:04.581 --> 15:05.747
It's not all glamour.

15:05.831 --> 15:08.212
<i>After Simon established
his industry cred,</i>

15:08.214 --> 15:09.630
<i>we cued up our show
for Brant.</i>

15:09.632 --> 15:11.212
Here we go.

15:12.334 --> 15:13.917
<i>"My name is Simon Kellogg,</i>

15:15.004 --> 15:16.887
<i>"and I'm
a professional security guard.</i>

15:16.889 --> 15:20.174
<i>"My job requires constant focus,
and split-second response time.</i>

15:22.011 --> 15:24.678
<i>"Nothing can keep me
from focusing on my duty,</i>

15:24.680 --> 15:26.263
<i>"except for one thing...</i>

15:26.265 --> 15:30.818
<i>"A crippling obsession
with large breasts.</i>

15:30.820 --> 15:32.486
<i>"This is my story.</i>

15:32.488 --> 15:34.458
"This is <i> Simon Sees."</i>

15:39.299 --> 15:42.196
<i>Every morning, I wake up
about 7:00 a.m. or 7:15 a.m.,</i>

15:42.198 --> 15:43.997
and then I usually have
a glass of water

15:43.999 --> 15:46.036
<i>that I put on the bedside table
the night before.</i>

15:49.421 --> 15:50.921
<i>Then I make my bed,</i>

15:50.923 --> 15:53.373
and then I go into the bathroom
and I, uh, shave,

15:53.375 --> 15:55.442
<i>brush my teeth,
and take a shower.</i>

15:57.172 --> 15:59.148
Next, I come back
into my bedroom, and,

15:59.215 --> 16:01.882
if it's a work day,
I put on my security uniform.

16:01.884 --> 16:05.644
<i>Uh, usually my socks first,
and then my pants,</i>

16:06.889 --> 16:10.019
<i>and then my undershirt,
and then my security shirt.</i>

16:10.400 --> 16:13.310
I usually don't do up my pants
until I have my shirts on,

16:13.312 --> 16:15.362
<i>because it's easier to tuck
my shirts in,</i>

16:15.364 --> 16:16.952
<i>after I've had my pants on.</i>

16:18.701 --> 16:21.068
Then I go into my kitchen,
and I usually have, uh,

16:21.070 --> 16:23.203
breakfast, and sometimes
a cup of coffee.

16:23.205 --> 16:25.539
<i>Today, for breakfast,
I made a Hot Pockets sandwich,</i>

16:25.557 --> 16:27.967
<i>because it tasted better
than eating cereal.</i>

16:29.719 --> 16:32.212
Then the microwave sounded,
and I knew my Hot Pockets

16:32.214 --> 16:33.943
was done, so I took it out
of the microwave.

16:36.218 --> 16:39.253
My trick is to take, uh,
the first bite, and then

16:39.255 --> 16:42.306
open the sandwich a little bit,
and then I blow on the inside,

16:42.308 --> 16:43.964
<i>uh, to cool it down.</i>

16:44.560 --> 16:45.926
And then after I finished

16:45.928 --> 16:49.062
eating the Hot Pockets sandwich,
I, uh, rinsed off my plate,

16:49.064 --> 16:50.467
<i>and put it on the dish drainer.</i>

16:51.837 --> 16:53.675
<i>Then I leave the house
and go to work.</i>

16:54.937 --> 16:57.070
<i>Today I was assigned to work
at a jewelry store</i>

16:57.072 --> 16:58.238
<i>in Chatsworth.</i>

16:58.240 --> 17:00.157
<i>I always try to be honest
about things,</i>

17:00.159 --> 17:02.910
<i>so whenever I start a new job,
I always try to let the owner</i>

17:02.912 --> 17:05.444
<i>know about me,
so there will be no surprises.</i>

17:05.446 --> 17:08.080
There is just one thing that
I think you should know about...

17:08.083 --> 17:11.034
Um, sometimes I get distracted
by women with big chests,

17:11.036 --> 17:13.036
um, you know, I might be
looking at them, or something,

17:13.038 --> 17:14.138
But I, I-- I-- I--

17:14.166 --> 17:16.204
Okay, this is something
we really don't need to discuss,

17:16.221 --> 17:17.708
-  I believe.
- Okay.

17:17.710 --> 17:21.178
<i>After I briefed him, I got in to
my position and started working.</i>

17:21.180 --> 17:23.380
<i>I like to stand by the door,
so I can see everybody</i>

17:23.382 --> 17:27.050
<i>who's coming in, and watch
for any suspicious people.</i>

17:27.051 --> 17:29.136
<i>I noticed that there was
a female employee,</i>

17:29.138 --> 17:32.022
<i>Uh, she was Asian, and in her--
in her early to mid 30s.</i>

17:32.024 --> 17:34.107
<i>But she was not a distraction,
because she did not</i>

17:34.142 --> 17:35.244
<i>have large breasts.</i>

17:35.644 --> 17:37.589
<i>Then,
about 20 or 30 minutes later,</i>

17:37.622 --> 17:40.147
<i>I heard the door open,
and I saw a customer walk in.</i>

17:40.149 --> 17:42.731
<i>And I noticed it was a woman
with large breasts.</i>

17:44.787 --> 17:47.404
If a robbery happened then,
I would proba-- probably

17:47.406 --> 17:49.656
be so distracted by the woman,
that I would probably

17:49.658 --> 17:51.658
not even notice it.

17:51.660 --> 17:53.377
<i>While the woman
was in the store,</i>

17:53.379 --> 17:54.661
<i>I just kept thinking about
all the things</i>

17:54.663 --> 17:55.712
<i>I'd like to do with her.</i>

17:55.714 --> 17:57.130
How I'd like to
get naked with her,

17:57.132 --> 17:59.800
and start to, uh,
start to hold her breasts,

17:59.802 --> 18:03.503
and, uh, massage them.
And then, um, to use my hands

18:03.505 --> 18:06.006
and try to uh, try to rock them.

18:06.008 --> 18:07.519
And, uh, massage them.

18:09.561 --> 18:12.320
That's super, super pretty.
I really like that.

18:12.371 --> 18:15.015
<i>Well, when I get into
this state, time stands still</i>

18:15.017 --> 18:17.985
<i>or it kinda like, slows down,
uh, uh, to a--</i>

18:17.987 --> 18:19.686
<i>to an almost-stopping point.</i>

18:19.688 --> 18:21.605
<i>I mean, I have a little bit
of a sense of time.</i>

18:21.607 --> 18:23.657
I know that time is moving,
but it's movinga

18:23.659 --> 18:25.035
<i>very, very slowly.</i>

18:25.944 --> 18:27.995
<i>When she left,
I opened the door for her,</i>

18:27.997 --> 18:29.613
<i>And said,
"Good-bye, have a nice day."</i>

18:29.615 --> 18:31.498
- Thank you, have a good day.
- You too, thank you.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.750
<i>It allows me to get
one last glance</i>

18:33.752 --> 18:35.549
<i>A-- a-- at her, as she leaves.</i>

18:37.616 --> 18:40.117
I think they were probably
"D" or double "D".

18:41.162 --> 18:43.210
<i>After, when there was
a break in the customers,</i>

18:43.212 --> 18:45.095
<i>I felt the need to go to
my employer and</i>

18:45.097 --> 18:46.580
<i>explain my situation to him.</i>

18:46.599 --> 18:48.094
Um, I don't know
if you're aware of this,

18:48.127 --> 18:50.050
but a little while ago,
a young woman came in

18:50.052 --> 18:51.468
who had a very big chest,

18:51.470 --> 18:54.054
and, um, I couldn't help but
look at her, and I--

18:54.056 --> 18:55.792
I got a little distracted,
I don't know if you...

18:55.829 --> 18:57.557
Um, I don't know
that this should be something

18:57.559 --> 18:58.859
that we keep bringing up, Simon.

18:58.861 --> 19:00.310
I'm just concerned
why you keep bringing it up.

19:00.312 --> 19:02.229
I don't think it's necessary
to talk about it,

19:02.231 --> 19:03.814
as long as you can do your job.

19:03.816 --> 19:04.918
- Okay.
- Okay?

19:04.973 --> 19:07.200
Well I promise I won't let
myself get distracted again.

19:07.202 --> 19:09.653
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:09.655 --> 19:11.571
<i>I think the experience
changed me for the better,</i>

19:11.573 --> 19:13.373
<i>because it helped me
realize that</i>

19:13.375 --> 19:15.575
<i>it was pretty embarrassing
to talk about that,</i>

19:15.577 --> 19:17.377
<i>so, um, next time</i>

19:17.379 --> 19:20.130
I probably won't tell my boss
about being distracted at work

19:20.132 --> 19:21.520
by women with large breasts.

19:28.954 --> 19:32.476
Uh, uh listen. It's well shot,
it's well put together,

19:32.478 --> 19:34.761
um, the idea that
you can't do your job

19:34.763 --> 19:36.763
with large breasts
floating around

19:36.765 --> 19:38.181
- is a funny hook.
- Yeah.

19:38.183 --> 19:40.934
Uh, the biggest limitation,
of course, is that

19:40.936 --> 19:42.018
there's nowhere to sell it.

19:42.020 --> 19:43.320
Well,
I think that a lot of people--

19:43.322 --> 19:45.322
not just security guards,
a lot of men--

19:45.324 --> 19:47.991
when they watch this,
they would probably feel

19:47.993 --> 19:49.409
- a little less...
- Right.

19:49.411 --> 19:50.861
like it was a perversion,
and more of a natural thing,

19:50.863 --> 19:52.946
- You know? Yeah.
- Right.

19:52.948 --> 19:56.500
- Right, so it's humanizing it.
- Yeah. In your current form,

19:56.502 --> 19:59.252
I'm gonna have to say no,
I'm sorry. It's a pass.

19:59.254 --> 20:01.705
- And pass means that...
- No.

20:01.707 --> 20:03.123
Right.

20:03.449 --> 20:06.050
<i>I was upset that
we couldn't sell the show.</i>

20:06.591 --> 20:08.792
<i>But I felt even worse
that I let down Simon,</i>

20:08.794 --> 20:10.322
<i>after getting his hopes up.</i>

20:10.342 --> 20:12.462
- Are you sad?
- A little bit.

20:12.464 --> 20:14.631
I really was hoping
that he liked the show.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.683
<i>But Simon showed a quality
that day,</i>

20:16.685 --> 20:19.602
<i>that you rarely see in people:
perseverance.</i>

20:19.604 --> 20:21.805
He's probably a little bit--
a little bit out of touch

20:21.807 --> 20:24.274
with the mainstream audience
in America, I think.

20:24.276 --> 20:26.142
I think we should
keep the breasts part,

20:26.144 --> 20:30.480
and maybe, uh, maybe also
include me in my Elvis costume.

20:30.482 --> 20:33.483
- Do you have an Elvis costume?
- Yes.

20:33.485 --> 20:36.286
<i>Simon didn't want to give up
on our show.</i>

20:36.288 --> 20:38.538
<i>And even though it was obvious
that the Elvis costume</i>

20:38.540 --> 20:42.075
<i>would only make things worse,
his spirit made me realize</i>

20:42.077 --> 20:44.327
<i>that Simon would be fine,
no matter what</i>

20:44.329 --> 20:45.495
<i>life threw at him.</i>

20:52.504 --> 20:54.056
- That was great.
- Okay.
