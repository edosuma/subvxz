00:55.560 --> 00:58.160
[crows cawing]

01:02.000 --> 01:05.560
[Preacher] Blessed are the words
of the Emperor!

01:05.640 --> 01:09.680
For it is He who lights our way!

01:10.280 --> 01:14.320
In His beneficence,
He has bestowed upon us

01:14.520 --> 01:19.000
His great librarium,
so that lowly servants

01:19.240 --> 01:22.920
such as I might share His word!

01:23.640 --> 01:27.240
Know then, that in the time before,

01:27.520 --> 01:30.800
when the stars were but young...

01:31.360 --> 01:34.160
...and the galaxy steeped in darkness...

01:34.240 --> 01:38.440
...it was the Emperor
who first brought light!

01:48.560 --> 01:50.240
[footsteps]

01:55.120 --> 01:57.880
[Prefect] Counting is your duty.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.280
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-three,

02:08.840 --> 02:11.320
nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-four...

02:11.680 --> 02:13.160
my counting is my duty.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.000
[Prefect] There shall be no thinking.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.480
[sludging]

02:21.240 --> 02:25.360
[Prefect] To reason is to consider lies.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.160
[Prefect] There shall be no reading.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.720
[snoring]

02:38.480 --> 02:41.320
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-six...

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
[sludge]

02:44.720 --> 02:47.200
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-six...

02:49.000 --> 02:50.360
...nine hundred and ninety-six...

02:51.120 --> 02:53.920
[Prefect] There shall be no talking.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.480
Knowledge corrupts.

03:02.760 --> 03:04.520
It is a dangerous thing.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Do you understand this, Adept Neath?

03:11.200 --> 03:13.600
I do, Prefect.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.680
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-seven,

03:18.760 --> 03:21.120
nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-eight.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.000
The Emperor's light is the only light.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.280
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-nineâ€¦ [gasps]

03:27.360 --> 03:29.400
[ominous music]

03:37.280 --> 03:38.640
Ten thousand.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.320
Ten thousand and one,
ten thousand and two...

03:43.120 --> 03:45.800
[Prefect] There shall be no talking.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.800
Have you ever noticed that sometimes

03:52.160 --> 03:54.720
there are the wrong number of books?

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
No.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.200
[footsteps]

04:22.240 --> 04:26.280
[Prefect] To contemplate
is to invite treachery.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.760
[Prefect] Counting is your duty.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.560
[footsteps]

04:43.040 --> 04:45.800
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-six,

04:46.160 --> 04:48.000
my counting is my duty.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.360
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-seven...

04:52.840 --> 04:54.400
[footsteps approaching]

05:07.200 --> 05:09.760
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-eight,

05:09.840 --> 05:12.200
the Emperor's light is my only light.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.520
Nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-nineâ€¦ [gasps]

05:24.520 --> 05:27.520
[Prefect] There shall be no reading.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.240
[eerie sounds]

05:41.440 --> 05:45.040
[Demonic voices] Do it.
Embrace your hunger.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.520
Feel how it gnaws at you.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.360
How you long to run your eyes
across those pages,

05:51.440 --> 05:56.760
feel its knowledge seep into your mind.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.480
Take the book. Show us, Neath.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.520
Let us see.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.600
[gasps]

06:05.680 --> 06:08.080
[heavy breathing]

06:13.680 --> 06:14.760
[sighs]

06:21.520 --> 06:22.680
Ten thousand,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
ten thousand and one,

06:25.760 --> 06:27.000
ten thousand and two...

06:31.880 --> 06:35.880
[Prefect] To reason is to consider lies.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.400
[Preacher] The importance of these books
cannot be understated.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.040
[Preacher 2] Why are we kept waiting?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.440
[Preacher] They should be here!

06:50.240 --> 06:52.360
[Preacher 2] This is testing my patience.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.880
[Preacher] I can't preach without books.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.760
[Preacher 2]
These books had better be worth it!

07:08.360 --> 07:10.160
Welcome, welcome!

07:10.880 --> 07:16.880
Once again, we are most honoured
to receive such auspicious guests.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.760
Quite so, Prefect.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.400
You are blessed indeed to serve
the Emperor through our patronage.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.600
That I am.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.720
Are the new volumes ready?

07:32.640 --> 07:33.800
They are.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.800
Good.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.800
All is as it should be.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.920
Through us, the Emperor's grace
will inspire thousands.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.320
Have the next batch ready early.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.040
Of course.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.880
Blessing of the Emperor upon you.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.320
Our fate is in His hands.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.840
[ominous noise]

08:16.920 --> 08:18.760
[gasps]

08:18.840 --> 08:20.880
[heavy breathing]

08:29.680 --> 08:32.960
Ten thousand and one,
my counting is my duty.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.800
[Prefect] There shall be no thinking.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.080
[Prefect] There shall be no talking.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.120
What? What is it?

09:01.600 --> 09:02.640
A book.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.320
An extra book. You were right.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.440
I found one, there on the shelf.

09:08.920 --> 09:09.920
You did?

09:10.560 --> 09:11.880
Did you read it?

09:12.440 --> 09:13.440
No.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.240
Tell me, where did you find it?

09:18.840 --> 09:22.560
Section twelve, seventy-one A,
where I count.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.600
Who are you?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.640
My name is Bole.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.160
[whimpering]

09:59.680 --> 10:02.360
[Prefect] Counting is your duty.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.280
[heavy breathing]

10:17.160 --> 10:18.200
No...

10:18.880 --> 10:20.240
That can't be...

10:22.360 --> 10:26.440
[Prefect]
To contemplate is to invite treachery.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.120
Bole? Bole?

10:35.200 --> 10:36.360
Bole?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.840
[gasping]

10:49.920 --> 10:52.160
There shall be no talking!

10:53.400 --> 10:58.240
It seems I must remind you of the rules,
Adept Neath.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.400
I'm sorry, Prefect.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.080
It's just... the extra book.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.880
Extra books?

11:05.960 --> 11:08.600
Have you failed in your counting duties?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.840
I was trying to find Adept Bole.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.240
He knows all about it.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.360
There is no Adept Bole.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.400
But... Prefect,

11:20.840 --> 11:22.520
I spoke with him.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.160
You are mistaken.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.880
There has never been
an adept here with that name.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.800
Then perhaps I misheard his name.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.480
He had a marking, a scar
on the side of his neck.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.520
To question is to undermine authority.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.360
There shall be no more talking.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.320
Yes, Prefect.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.760
[Prefect] Now go.

11:48.280 --> 11:52.600
And do not allow your thoughts
to betray you.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.240
[screeching]

12:12.160 --> 12:14.080
[heavy breathing]

12:15.320 --> 12:18.200
[Prefect] There shall be no reading.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.360
[intense build-up]

12:45.920 --> 12:48.240
Agh!

12:48.320 --> 12:50.480
[panting]

12:58.600 --> 13:00.280
[panting]

13:00.360 --> 13:01.360
[shaking]

13:05.120 --> 13:07.920
[screeches]

13:20.160 --> 13:24.000
Look. Look. Look...

13:25.920 --> 13:28.080
[Demonic voices] Let us see...

13:37.680 --> 13:40.600
Look. Look.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.200
[Demonic voices] Embrace the change...

13:57.360 --> 14:01.760
[panting and screaming]

14:34.920 --> 14:36.480
[roaring]

14:36.560 --> 14:40.160
[screaming]

14:54.760 --> 14:57.600
Greetings, most auspicious...

14:57.680 --> 14:59.080
Yes, yes!

14:59.160 --> 15:01.680
-Are they ready?
-Of course.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.800
Just as you required.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.320
Good.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.200
Yes...

15:20.360 --> 15:22.320
Come along. Hurry!

15:22.400 --> 15:23.920
There's work to be done.

15:28.320 --> 15:32.440
[eerie sounds]

15:34.360 --> 15:36.640
We shall return tomorrow, Prefect.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.960
Be ready.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.200
Of course.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.840
[Cawing]

15:51.400 --> 15:53.720
[Priest] Gather round!

15:54.120 --> 15:58.040
Lend me your ears and listen well

15:58.680 --> 16:03.560
for I bear words
of loving enlightenment...

16:05.640 --> 16:07.600
...and of the brilliance...

16:07.680 --> 16:12.520
...that shines upon the darkest corners
of our galaxy...

16:15.840 --> 16:20.080
...and in its magnificence, brings forth

16:20.160 --> 16:21.920
the gift of change!

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
[cheering]

16:39.520 --> 16:41.600
Knowledge corrupts.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.320
It is a dangerous thing...

16:48.240 --> 16:51.480
[snarling]
