es wrong, you'll kill thousands.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.680
It won't go wrong.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.680
It'll finish what we started.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.560
That's why we're here, isn't it?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.760
at if there was a good reason...
for us to go...

15:54.760 --> 15:56.200
something that affects us both?

16:02.400 --> 16:03.560
Do we have a problem?

16:06.280 --> 16:07.200
No.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.360
Trust me.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.720
We can do this.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.600
You'd be amazed
of this stuff is floating about.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.720
just need to get my access back
to the Central Security Network.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
I'll be back.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.160
Hello?

16:52.560 --> 16:53.680
PC Knowles?

16:57.680 --> 16:58.800
PC Knowles?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.320
-[Blake] Hello, Elsa.
-Hello.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.680

17:19.720 --> 17:20.680

17:21.360 --> 17:24.280

17:25.320 --> 17:26.760
They're already on their way.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.560
It's all right, won't be long.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.040
I don't scare that easy.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.440
[laughs]

17:34.640 --> 17:36.080
What do you want?

17:36.800 --> 17:38.440
just need your codes for the...

17:38.640 --> 17:40.200
Central Security Network.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.200
Huh? No.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.440
Give me the codes!

17:45.960 --> 17:48.480
have thought better about taking
shite when you first turned up.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.080
not taking your shite any more--

17:51.400 --> 17:52.440
[chokes]

17:54.360 --> 17:56.080
e we're going to have to do this
the hard way.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.200
[stabbing]

18:01.800 --> 18:03.400
[Gray screams]

18:07.040 --> 18:08.400
[thud, Blake groans]

18:09.080 --> 18:10.200
[Gray yells]

18:18.160 --> 18:19.280
[Gray groans]

18:22.560 --> 18:23.720
Codes, please.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.760
Nae chance.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.600
[groans]

18:31.120 --> 18:32.400
[Gray screams]

18:56.600 --> 18:59.360
Harry, I've got... bad news.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.600
What happened?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.320
I think I might have...

19:42.160 --> 19:43.560
overstepped the mark.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.240
It's okay. It's okay.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.800
[Eve gasps]

19:48.600 --> 19:49.680
[knock]

19:56.600 --> 19:57.720
He's definitely not here.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.560
I'm not here to arrest him.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.200
[Harry] You heard the man, Rich.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.000
He needs my help.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.560
Morning.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.560
Terrible about Gray.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.000
Yeah.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.560
Yeah, she was...

20:15.760 --> 20:18.000
far from perfect, but...
she didn't deserve that.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.200
No, she didn't.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.600
Do we know what happened?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.120
We know Blake went to her house
for a reason.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.120
Okay, let's have a look,
and then you can arrest me.

20:28.120 --> 20:32.400
For attempted murder, theft,
damage to police property...

20:33.360 --> 20:35.560
Evading arrest. I could go on.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.600
Yeah, it's been a busy few days.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.360
ger fish to fry now, though, eh?

20:41.160 --> 20:42.320
-[Harry] See you later.
-[Rich] See you.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.280
[Steve] See you.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.600
Blake.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.520
Efficient...

21:02.440 --> 21:03.760
Brutal. I think so.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.160
The only question is, why?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.280
Gray was unfinished business.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.000
d already tried to kill her once
and failed.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.000
We know he's a man of purpose.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.160
oking forwards, never backwards.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.400
Why's he still in London, eh?

21:22.320 --> 21:23.680
What's he planning next...?

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
Oh...

21:29.000 --> 21:30.160
Interesting.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.360
Hard drive was ejected at 20:36.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.000
Gray's estimated time of death.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.040
-By Blake?
-Hmm.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.560
What would he want with that?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.480
Only one way to find out.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.600
No.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.760
No. No, no, no, no.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.120
This computer will be linked
to the MIS servers.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.280
Anything she accessed here
okmarked on the internal system.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.000
You know what's book marked
on my internal system?

21:55.480 --> 21:59.240
The day I don't have to spy
own department for you anymore.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.560
Come on.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.600

22:14.640 --> 22:16.400
No, we go on.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.520
-What?
ow that Madame Cheung is dead...

22:26.720 --> 22:29.160
put this on me and then take it
off when I've got what I need.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.040
No, that's not part of the deal.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.320
Nor was this hole in my side,
t that's where we are right now.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.000
against everything we stand for!

22:36.400 --> 22:40.320
I am here because I wanted
elp you destroy the bracelets...

22:44.720 --> 22:46.320

22:49.600 --> 22:51.520
Wait! Eve! [groans]

22:54.280 --> 22:55.320
I don't wanna do this...

22:56.480 --> 22:58.080
but I can only destroy them
with your help.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.160
Please.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.280
Then we can go.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.440
We can leave all this behind.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.200
ell] How are you getting on with
ay's phone and computer records?

23:15.240 --> 23:17.080
-[man] Here you go, sir.
-Right, let me see.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.560
Yeah.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.720
Thanks.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.400
[phone ringing]

23:30.200 --> 23:31.680
'm not going to like this, am I?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.760
[Orwell] No, you're not, mate.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.560
Blake used Gray's computer
to access CSN servers.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.720
gging for a distribution roster.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.600
itive materials being dispatched
to London hospitals

23:41.640 --> 23:43.000
in the next seven days.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.160
hat kind of sensitive materials?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.800
[Orwell] Radioactive cores used
ay machines, that kind of thing.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.720
n does the next delivery go out?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.360
[Orwell] One due tonight.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.280
es going out to three locations,

23:54.320 --> 23:58.240
ith the Royal Limehouse Hospital
at 19:00 hours.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.240
-That's the hit.
- I'll contact SO19.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.480
No, SO19 will still be gunning
for me. It's too risky.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.080
're talking about putting a stop
a man who killed Suri, and Gray.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.280
I'm not gonna risk losing Blake
e your situation is compromised.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.360
-Steve, please...
-Harry.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.320
I'm making the call, okay.

24:16.600 --> 24:17.800
See you at the hospital.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.440
So...

24:35.320 --> 24:37.320
's your suicide mission looking?

24:38.400 --> 24:39.480
Oh, you know...

24:40.360 --> 24:41.640
Extremely suicidal.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.600
Which is why I was wondering,
you like to come along with me?

24:49.200 --> 24:52.160
Oh, yeah, that sounds exactly
like my kind of gig,

24:52.200 --> 24:54.240
chasing after a psychotic ex-spy

24:54.280 --> 24:56.320
who's probably trying to blow up
London, or something.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.320
trying to blow up London, is he?
-No.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.120
Not all of it.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.600
Come on, Rich, look,
is you to buy me a bit of time.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.680
-I can handle Blake.
-Oh, that's all you need, is it?

25:12.360 --> 25:17.000
ally, really wish I had a normal
rother, maybe a nice accountant.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
No, you don't.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.080
When Eve gave me the bracelet,

25:22.120 --> 25:23.440
you were the first person
I brought in on it. Why?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.240
Because I knew you'd be there...

25:26.800 --> 25:28.000
You've always been there.

25:29.640 --> 25:30.760
So what do you say?

25:31.680 --> 25:34.200
ton Boys ride out one last time?

25:37.600 --> 25:39.000
If not for me...

25:40.400 --> 25:41.560
then for Suri.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.600
Ready?

26:02.200 --> 26:03.320
This is not the way.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.520
It's the only way.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.440
, then you have to promise me...

26:14.280 --> 26:16.040
ill only use it when you need to

26:16.080 --> 26:18.520
nd the moment you get back here,
you let me take it off.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.000
I promise.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.080
-Tails.
-Neither.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.000
Away we go.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.760
Rich] So, what's the plan, then?

26:59.800 --> 27:01.360
We just walk up to the nearest
security guard

27:01.400 --> 27:03.120
and tell them an armed lunatic
about to attack?

27:03.480 --> 27:04.760
Pretty much, yeah.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.040
Whoa, that doesn't sound
like the best idea.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.680
You may be right.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.760
-[Rich] Is that them?
-Okay.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.080
They're early.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.560
I know.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.440
Oh, Harry, wait for back-up.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.400
[sighs]

27:24.520 --> 27:27.640
Harry Clayton. We have reason to
his van is about to be attacked.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.600
lake] Back from the dead, Harry?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.080
Here to the bitter end.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.040
[Blake] Jolly good.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.480
ell, enjoy the next ten seconds.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.760
[gunshot]

27:47.120 --> 27:48.200
[Rich] Drop the gun.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.680
Fair enough...

27:54.040 --> 27:55.160
You've got me.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.600
[Harry] Rich, don't.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.400
-He has the bracelet!
-Do your worst.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.360
[Rich] Shit.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.680
-Oh, dear...
-Rich!

28:04.800 --> 28:06.160
[Rich screams]

28:09.160 --> 28:10.600
I could get used to this.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.200
After everything you said.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.800
knew you were a weak man, Blake.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.440
This is just temporary,
il I destroy them, I assure you.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.560
ave been hard for you, though...

28:25.480 --> 28:26.560

28:26.600 --> 28:27.720
It was.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.680

29:16.680 --> 29:19.160
No, we haven't.
t your phone out, open your GPS.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.160
-You can track me, yeah?
-[Rich] Yeah, yeah.

Okay, we need to split up.

[Rich] No way...

29:47.240 --> 29:49.160

29:49.200 --> 29:51.160
Too many people have been hurt.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.600
I don't know how this pans out. t get lucky, I might not, but...

29:54.160 --> 29:57.200
Look after Daisy.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.520
[police sirens approaching]

30:01.440 --> 30:02.440

30:03.400 --> 30:04.560
And get him this time.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.400
[police siren nearing]

30:20.160 --> 30:21.280
[Eve] Samuel...

30:22.560 --> 30:24.240
I need the bracelet off you.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.720
The firing charge is loaded.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.240
You promised you'd give it back.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.160
It's corrupting you.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.760
ayton tried to use the bracelets

30:44.760 --> 30:46.240
Please...

30:46.280 --> 30:48.640
Will you just think
about what you're doing?

30:49.240 --> 30:50.480
People could get hurt.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.080
There are other ways
to destroy the bracelets.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.160
you don't like it, then here...

30:57.800 --> 30:59.160
Take them off me...

31:00.200 --> 31:01.600

31:02.680 --> 31:03.760
-What...?
-Come on, Eve.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.400
Show me what you're made of.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
-[Eve gasps]

31:11.160 --> 31:12.640
What are you waiting for?

31:15.600 --> 31:17.000
You're weak...

31:18.240 --> 31:19.760
Just like all the Torches...

31:19.800 --> 31:21.360
Just like your mother.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.360
d gasp] I can't let you do this.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.400
[gun clicks, empty chamber]

31:27.440 --> 31:29.400
-[gasps]
-I thought so.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.640
[groans]

31:40.040 --> 31:41.560
u had a little more faith in me.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.400
We could have achieved
extraordinary things together.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.040
You're insane.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.520
you're just like everyone else.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.160
ou're just a scared little girl.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.480
Onto your knees.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.000
Sorry, Steve.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.160
Harry?

32:27.040 --> 32:28.720
I don't suppose
he told you where he was going.

32:29.520 --> 32:30.600
'Fraid not.

32:33.080 --> 32:36.760
Suspect's on foot. We lost him
just west of the Thames Cut.

33:23.480 --> 33:26.400

33:27.040 --> 33:28.040
Oi.

[Blake] Harry.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.520

33:50.800 --> 33:52.360
[Blake] A fission chamber...

33:52.400 --> 33:54.680
ntense voltage burst will do it.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.000
curse of the bracelets forever.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.360
Not without this.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.800
Thousands of lives lost
cause of your deranged vendetta.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.560
n't let that happen on my watch.

34:09.400 --> 34:12.400
Besides, I'm not even sure
're going to go through with it.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.480
Look at you, with that thing
on your wrist, Blake...

34:15.800 --> 34:17.680
so ready to sell yourself out...

34:18.200 --> 34:21.280

34:24.360 --> 34:25.600

34:29.160 --> 34:30.600

34:31.560 --> 34:33.400

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
d want me to do the right thing.

34:40.200 --> 34:41.440
You're forgetting something...

34:43.680 --> 34:45.000
I'm protected.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.160
Let's see.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.280
[Harry groans]

35:02.600 --> 35:04.760
e, I may have sold myself out...

35:06.360 --> 35:09.560
But I've still won, Harry.
I have luck on my side.

35:11.560 --> 35:12.800
Not anymore you don't.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.280
ng else I've learned about luck.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.600
[groans]

35:20.640 --> 35:22.760
Sometimes it's other people.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.000
Bye-bye, Harry.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.080
I know luck, you don't.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.480
-It's wild, Blake...
-[punch, groan]

35:50.320 --> 35:51.600
But in the end...

35:52.240 --> 35:53.760
it does exactly what it wants.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.120
[Blake screams]

35:56.520 --> 35:58.440
[Blake shouts]

35:58.480 --> 36:02.320
fight all we want, but sometimes
you just got to let it happen.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.160
nd then luck changes everything,
so tell me...

36:06.200 --> 36:08.800
-Are you feeling lucky, Blake?
-[Blake shouts]

36:11.600 --> 36:13.040
[Eve] Blake!

36:13.360 --> 36:14.480
What are you doing?

36:15.480 --> 36:17.080
Taking back control.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.040
-[Blake] Stop!
-[alarm wails]

36:19.080 --> 36:20.760
that, you'll destroy everything!

36:21.640 --> 36:22.760
Don't!

36:23.760 --> 36:25.200
[punches, groans]

36:27.200 --> 36:29.480
[Blake screams]

36:43.800 --> 36:45.560
] You've always been lucky, Dad.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.240
It's a part of you.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.000
[explosion]

37:08.600 --> 37:10.120
[Orwell] Harry Clayton was...

37:11.240 --> 37:13.320
not the best police officer
I've ever known.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.000
He was a very complicated one.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.280
He lied...

37:20.200 --> 37:21.160
He cheated...

37:22.120 --> 37:23.640
Never went by the book...

37:26.720 --> 37:28.160
I think if I'm honest...

37:29.120 --> 37:31.080
hy I was always so jealous of...

37:32.240 --> 37:34.200
how brilliant he was at his job.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.600
't a conventional police officer by any means.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.480
But he always closed cases.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.280
He fought against bad men.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.520
He fought...

37:49.040 --> 37:50.640
o make the world a better place,

37:52.200 --> 37:54.120
I asked him once how he did it?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.400
He told me simply...

37:59.240 --> 38:00.440
I never stop.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.680
Never.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.000
He never backed down...

38:08.600 --> 38:10.200
and however far he fell...

38:13.080 --> 38:14.360
he never stopped fighting.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.080
[doorbell]

38:23.240 --> 38:25.000
Hold on, I'll ring you back.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.000
[reads] "The best luck is that
which you make yourself."

39:07.720 --> 39:10.000
-[Daisy] Dad...
-Yeah?

39:10.200 --> 39:11.480
Look what I found!

39:13.600 --> 39:14.720
A pound.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.200
Ah! Lucky you.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.160
Come on.
