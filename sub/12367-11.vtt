- GIVE IT TO ME.

00:06.756 --> 00:08.383

00:08.466 --> 00:09.884

LOOKED UP ANY MAPS

00:09.968 --> 00:11.553
OR MADE HOTEL RESERVATIONS

00:11.636 --> 00:13.138

00:47.172 --> 00:49.674

OF THE "MYSTERY HOOKER."

00:49.758 --> 00:51.301

IF THE COPS PICK HER UP
AS A FUGITIVE,

10:46.687 --> 10:49.523
- NO, BUT SHE SOUNDS
SUSPICIOUSLY CATHOLIC.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.405
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.740
WE'VE BEEN DRIVING
AROUND FOR HOURS,

10:57.823 --> 10:58.991
AND NOW WE'RE IN
A BUGGY TRAFFIC JAM.

10:59.075 --> 10:59.950
[honks horn]

11:00.034 --> 11:03.287
MOVE YOUR ASS!

11:03.371 --> 11:05.706
- JOY!

11:05.790 --> 11:06.874
- WELL, I COULD SAY
"MOVE YOUR DONKEY,"

11:06.957 --> 11:09.710
BUT IT'S NOT AS SATISFYING.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.253
STILL NO RECEPTION?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.714
- NOPE, NO TELEPHONE RECEPTION
IN AMISH COUNTRY.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.384
- BUT I HAVE TO GET IN CONTACT
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.927
- WOULD YOU RELAX?

11:18.010 --> 11:19.470
ON THE RADIO THEY SAID THEY
STILL DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.930
AND THANKS TO YOUR HANDS,

11:21.013 --> 11:22.807
MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN
THINK YOU'RE A WOMAN.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.269
- AT THE MOMENT,
ARE YOU REALLY IN A POSITION

11:27.353 --> 11:29.522
TO CALL SOMEONE ELSE MANNISH?

11:29.605 --> 11:32.566
- OH, YEAH.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.110
I DON'T HAVE FOOD IN IT, DO I?

11:34.193 --> 11:35.820
I DON'T WANNA BE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.824
WE'RE LOST.

11:39.907 --> 11:44.620
LET'S ASK THAT OLD AMISH
WOMAN FOR DIRECTIONS.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.622
EXCUSE ME.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.165
ELKA!

11:48.249 --> 11:49.417
- ELKA?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.585
- THEE ARE MISTAKEN,

11:51.669 --> 11:52.837
HOOKERS.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.937
- WELL, THIS IS BETTER
THAN THE SHAKE WEIGHT.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.525
OH, IT'S THIS, UH--

12:14.608 --> 12:16.318
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT IT IS,

12:16.402 --> 12:17.820
BUT OF COURSE
I ORDERED IT.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.072
ALWAYS ON THE ETERNAL QUEST

12:20.156 --> 12:22.825
TO BE THINNER,
TIGHTER, YOUNGER.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.035
YOU SEE, ONCE YOU'RE
A CERTAIN AGE,

12:25.119 --> 12:27.121
CASTING DIRECTORS DON'T
GIVE YOU AUDITION SCENES.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.833
THEY GIVE YOU NAMES
OF PLASTIC SURGEONS.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.419
- DON'T THESE
CASTING DIRECTORS

12:33.502 --> 12:35.129
RECOGNIZE WHAT GOD MADE?

12:35.212 --> 12:36.505
- TRUST ME, IN HOLLYWOOD,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.841
GOD DOESN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE WHAT HE MADE.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.510
UM, IT'S A LITTLE
CHILLY IN HERE.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.637
DON'T YOU EVER THINK,
YOU KNOW,

12:43.721 --> 12:46.474
A LITTLE ELECTRICITY
WOULDN'T KILL US?

12:46.557 --> 12:49.477
- RELIANCE ON PUBLIC POWER
TIES US TO THE WORLD.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.812
- YEAH, BUT DON'T YOU EVER
WANT SOMETHING MORE?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.272
- DOESN'T THEE EVER TIRE

12:53.355 --> 12:55.357
OF ALWAYS WANTING
SOMETHING MORE?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.318
- YES.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.903
YES, I DO.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.033
BOY, LIVING HERE
MUST BE VERY FREEING.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.534
- OH, INDEED.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.453
THEE WOULD TRULY
FIND PEACE HERE.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.830
- OH, THAT SOUNDS NICE.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.665
- IT IS TIME TO TASTE.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.917
- OH.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.881
OH, MY LORD.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.884
IS THAT WHAT BUTTER
TASTES LIKE?

13:23.594 --> 13:27.431
THAT IS FANTASTIC,
AND I MADE IT.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.599
- YOUR FIRST CHURN.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.976
- OH.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.939
OH, AND LOOK, A CALLOUS.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.858
I AM SO EXCITED.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.694
- SOON THINE HANDS
WILL BE COVERED IN THESE.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.738
- A LITTLE LESS EXCITED.

13:42.821 --> 13:43.864
[knocking on door]

13:43.948 --> 13:45.449
- VICTORIA,
ARE YOU IN THERE?

13:45.533 --> 13:47.576
- OH, IT'S MY FRIENDS.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.953
OH, HI, GUYS.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.287
OH, GOOD, YOU CAUGHT ELKA.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.789
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.083
OF COURSE YOU KNOW
ELKA ALREADY.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.751
- AND THEE MUST BE JOY.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.919
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

13:57.002 --> 13:58.921
- ELKA TOLD ME
THEE PUT FORTH THY LEGS

13:59.004 --> 14:02.424
LIKE THE MIDDAY MEAL.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.552
- EXCEPT THAT MEN
ACTUALLY GET EXCITED

14:04.635 --> 14:06.595
ABOUT THE MIDDAY MEAL.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.890
- AND THIS IS--
- HI.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.767
- MEL?
- A MAN IS HERE.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.270
QUICK, TAKE OFF HIS BOOTS.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.105
FETCH HIM A PLATE AND
A WARM CLOTH FOR HIS BROW.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.065
- NO, NO, I'M NOT A MAN,
I'M NOT A MAN.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.276
ALTHOUGH YOU'RE KINDA
MAKING ME WISH I WAS.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.403
NO, IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU,

14:22.486 --> 14:23.988
BUT, VICTORIA, WE HAVE GOT
TO GET BACK TO CLEVELAND.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.823
- AND I'VE GOT
TO GET TO CANADA.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.825
- WE PROMISED
WE'D TAKE HER TO CANADA

14:27.908 --> 14:29.243
IF SHE HELPED US FIND YOU.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.452
SO COME ON,
LET'S GET A MOVE ON.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.662
- NO.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.330
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.748
- WHAT?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.084
- I HAVE EMBRACED
THE SIMPLE WAY.

14:37.167 --> 14:40.170
NO MORE RUNNING AROUND
LOOKING FOR WHAT I NEED.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.839
NOW I WILL STAY IN THE HOME,

14:41.922 --> 14:44.258
AND WHAT I NEED
WILL COME TO ME.

14:44.341 --> 14:47.970
- YOU SAID THAT EXACT SPEECH
WHEN YOU JOINED NETFLIX.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.474
- I LIKE IT HERE.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.143
AND THEY LIKE ME,

14:54.226 --> 14:56.103
AND THEY DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO I AM.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.397
- THAT MIGHT CHANGE
WHEN THEY DO.

15:01.066 --> 15:04.153
- I WANT TO LEARN TO BE
AT PEACE WITH MYSELF.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.822
-<i> COLOSSIANS</i> 3:15.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.658
- "LET THE PEACE OF GOD
RULE IN YOUR HEART."

15:09.742 --> 15:11.660
IT'S AN EXCELLENT PASSAGE.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.454
- YOU READ THE WHOLE BIBLE?

15:13.537 --> 15:15.539
- THERE'S NO TV.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.047
- DID YOU HAVE TO RIP
MY BEARD OFF LIKE THAT?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.173
- YOU TRICKED ME.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.008
- WE HAD TO.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.843
I KNOW WE SAID
WE'D TAKE YOU TO CANADA.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.178
- BUT WE ALSO KNEW
YOU'D FALL ASLEEP

15:29.261 --> 15:31.347
IF WE PUT ON NPR.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.475
- FRICKIN' GARRISON KEILLOR.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.020
- WELCOME HOME, LADIES.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.855
- MRS. SHAW.
- WHO'S SHE?

15:39.938 --> 15:41.315
- THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.067
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

15:43.150 --> 15:45.694
- THERE WAS A SPARE KEY
IN THE OBVIOUSLY FAKE ROCK

15:45.778 --> 15:47.321
ON YOUR PORCH.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.031
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.532
THIS IS HOME SECURITY MONTH.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.660
MY BRAINCHILD.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.870
DIDN'T YOU SEE
THE ETHNICALLY BALANCED THUGS

15:54.953 --> 15:57.623
ON THE BILLBOARDS?

15:57.706 --> 15:58.666
- WHY HAVEN'T
YOU RELEASED A STATEMENT

15:58.749 --> 16:01.043
CLARIFYING THAT I'M NOT
YOUR HUSBAND'S MISTRESS?

16:01.126 --> 16:02.836
I WAS JUST SHAPING
HIS EYEBROWS.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.588
- WE WERE WAITING
FOR THE POLLS TO COME IN.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.590
IF THE GOVERNOR
ADMITS TO INFIDELITY,

16:06.674 --> 16:09.259
HIS POLL NUMBERS
WILL GO DOWN 5%.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.388
BUT IF HE ADMITS TO GETTING
HIS EYEBROWS GROOMED,

16:12.471 --> 16:14.765
THEY GO DOWN 20%.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.600
THIS IS OHIO.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.394
WE WANT OUR MEN
TO BE UNGROOMED

16:18.477 --> 16:20.062
AND OUR VEGETABLES
TO BE MEAT.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.899
- AND WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

16:23.982 --> 16:25.859
- JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.028
AND IN EXCHANGE
I WILL USE MY INFLUENCE

16:28.112 --> 16:29.238
TO GET YOU A GREEN CARD.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.532
- JOY, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.575
- I GET TO STAY IN AMERICA.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.412
- THAT'S ANOTHER REASON
TO GO TO CANADA.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.707
- ELKA, COME ON.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.709
I KNOW YOU'RE HAPPY
JOY IS STAYING.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.461
- WHAT'S IT TO ME?
I'LL BE IN JAIL.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.424
- NO, YOU WON'T.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.426
LOOK, FORGET THE GREEN CARD.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.635
THE FAVOR I WANT FROM YOU

16:51.719 --> 16:53.762
IS TO GET THE GOVERNOR
TO PARDON ELKA.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.432
I DON'T WANT HER OLD BONES
RATTLING AROUND IN JAIL

16:56.515 --> 16:58.434
MAKING ME FEEL GUILTY.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.102
- NO, NO.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.062
HELP JOY.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.647
I DON'T WANT HER SKINNY BUTT
SHIPPED OFF TO ENGLAND

17:04.732 --> 17:07.233
MAKING ME FEEL GUILTY.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.777
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN PRISON.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.740
YOU'RE, LIKE,
A MILLION YEARS OLD.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.617
- YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE
WHO CAN STAND YOU.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.746
YOU WON'T FIND THAT
ANYWHERE ELSE.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.497
- I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU,

17:20.580 --> 17:22.583
YOU STUBBORN OLD
FROST-TOP.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.501
- AND I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU,

17:24.585 --> 17:27.588
YOU HALF-NAKED TEA BAG.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.467
- I COULD DO BOTH.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.844
both: OH!

17:33.927 --> 17:34.845
- DEAL.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.722
- YAY!

17:36.805 --> 17:38.348
- NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
LADIES,

17:38.432 --> 17:40.684
I NEED TO GO HOME
AND TELL MY HUSBAND

17:40.768 --> 17:43.771
HE'S BEEN CHEATING
AND BRAVELY STAND BY HIM.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.109
[all cheering]

17:49.193 --> 17:52.863
- I HAVE DISGRACED
MY GORGEOUS WIFE

17:52.946 --> 17:54.531
WITH A WOMAN WHO'S
NOT FIT TO MENTION

17:54.615 --> 17:56.700
IN THE SAME SENTENCE,

17:56.784 --> 17:58.786
A WOMAN WHO MEANT
NOTHING TO ME,

17:58.869 --> 18:00.662
A WOMAN OF LOW
MORAL CHARACTER.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.707
- ALL RIGHT,
WE GET IT.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.417
OH, WHO CARES?

18:05.501 --> 18:06.710
I GET MY GREEN CARD,

18:06.794 --> 18:08.378
AND YOU DON'T
GO TO PRISON.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.589
TO US.
- TO US.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.469
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SAY IT.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.304
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
A CELEBRATION

18:17.387 --> 18:18.514
WITHOUT VICTORIA.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.849
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.351
- AH.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.685
OH, THANK GOD.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.231
CHAMPAGNE AND
ELECTRICITY AND HEAT.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.982
AND SOMEBODY
JUST RUN THE BLENDER.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.778
I DON'T EVEN CARE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN IT.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.030
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO BE AMISH.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.699
- WELL, IT TURNS OUT
I WAS JUST AMISH-ISH.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.662
IT WAS ALL VERY FULFILLING
AND ENLIGHTENING,

18:41.745 --> 18:43.205
BUT AFTER WORKING
ALL DAY LONG

18:43.288 --> 18:44.873
THEY STARTED TALKING
ABOUT TOMORROW.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.208
AND THERE WAS THIS WHOLE
LAUNDRY LIST OF CHORES,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.377
AND ONE OF THEM WAS LAUNDRY.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.547
- WELL, WE'RE GLAD
YOU'RE HOME.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.383
- OH, AND I AM SO HAPPY
TO BE HOME.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.759
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,

18:55.843 --> 18:58.220
I THINK I'M EVEN HAPPIER
BECAUSE I EXPERIENCED

18:58.303 --> 19:00.055
THEIR WAY OF LIFE.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.682
OH, MY GOSH.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.226
THAT WAS MY RUMSPRINGA.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.727
- YOUR WHAT?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.564
- UH, IT'S A JOURNEY
OF DISCOVERY.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.233
AND I LEARNED
THAT A LIFE OF EXCESS

19:11.316 --> 19:13.944
AND SELF-INVOLVEMENT
IS WHERE MY TRUE HEART LIETH.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.409
[hooves clacking outside]
OH, DEAR.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.619
HE FOLLOWED ME.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.246
- WHO?
- IT'S MY HUSBAND.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.039
- WHAT?

19:26.123 --> 19:27.082
- YODER.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.417
WELL, MY HUSBAND-TO-BE.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.586
HE WON ME FAIR AND SQUARE
IN A CORN SHUCKING.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.758
- VICTORIA,
I HAVE FOUND THEE.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.885
LADIES.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.052
- HELLO, YODER.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.762
I'M SORRY THAT I LEFT
WITH SUCH HASTE,

19:40.846 --> 19:41.930
BUT YOU SEE, I CANNOT--

19:42.014 --> 19:43.432
- PLEASE, I'VE TRAVELED
MANY MILES.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.766
HEAR ME OUT.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.519
I LONG TO BUILD
A LIFE WITH THEE,

19:47.603 --> 19:49.855
A LIFE FULL OF KINDNESS
AND DEVOTION,

19:49.938 --> 19:51.940
AND ALL THAT CAN BE PROVIDED

19:52.024 --> 19:54.526
BY A TRUE HEART
AND TWO STRONG HANDS.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.486
- OH, MY GOODNESS,
THAT IS SO SWEET BUT--

19:56.570 --> 19:57.988
- SHE'S NOT A VIRGIN.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.948
- GOOD DAY.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.119
WHAT ABOUT THEE?

20:04.202 --> 20:05.829
- OH, TWO KIDS.
