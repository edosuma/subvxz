00:27.694 --> 00:29.763
Okay. How are we getting in?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.698
Actually, I'm not so sure.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.301
You're not sure?

00:35.435 --> 00:37.871
Well, I thought that,
by the time we made it...

00:38.371 --> 00:39.239
that I would've figured it out.

00:41.441 --> 00:42.876
Yeah, but...

00:43.443 --> 00:46.146
Okay, let's figure this out.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.081
All right,
let's check the windows

00:58.057 --> 00:58.925
Let's look around.

01:00.826 --> 01:01.994
Where do you think the will is?

01:02.361 --> 01:03.397
I'm not sure.

01:06.298 --> 01:07.967
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

01:09.902 --> 01:11.167
I'll have you know, I watched
every single <i>Scooby-Doo</i> episode

01:11.169 --> 01:12.338
at least twice.

01:12.804 --> 01:14.240
This is what they'd exactly do.

01:15.340 --> 01:16.910
You do realize that's a cartoon?

01:17.276 --> 01:18.110
Doesn't mean it's not real.

01:19.011 --> 01:19.845
Let's go here.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.282
Wait. Hold up.

01:30.756 --> 01:31.390
Double up.

01:40.366 --> 01:41.168
Go! Go! Go!

01:47.940 --> 01:49.810
Who's ever down there,
show yourself. We're armed.

01:52.979 --> 01:53.880
Go! Go! Go!

01:58.351 --> 02:00.817
Remind me when you come up
with a brilliant idea, to pass.

02:00.819 --> 02:03.420
- I'm really sorry, Madison!
- It's okay!

02:03.422 --> 02:05.392
I'm super-sorry!

02:45.565 --> 02:46.833
Good move, Peter.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.943
Oh, I bet I could do that.

03:30.508 --> 03:32.044
Atta boy. Good move, Peter.

03:38.483 --> 03:40.953
Ouch! That's gonna leave a mark.

03:51.396 --> 03:53.397
Jackson, come on. We gotta go.
We're late!

03:53.399 --> 03:54.964
Dad's going to kill us!

03:54.966 --> 03:56.399
What?
We just got here.

03:56.401 --> 03:58.604
Boy, I hate it
when he does this.

04:07.446 --> 04:10.015
Ah, boarding. It's the life.

04:58.229 --> 05:00.566
What? Never seen
a skateboarding dog before?

05:22.587 --> 05:24.256
Peter, wait up! What's the rush?

05:25.590 --> 05:27.557
I'm tired, you butt.

05:27.559 --> 05:28.994
I'm gonna walk
the rest of the way.

05:30.729 --> 05:33.997
- What are you doing?
- Hey, not as young as you.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.501
Dog years, remember?

05:36.234 --> 05:37.634
Come on, boy.
We're gonna be late.

05:37.636 --> 05:38.505
Let's go, Jackson. Let's go.

05:39.438 --> 05:41.040
Okay, okay.
I only have four paws.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.083
Yes! The coast is clear.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.321
Come on, Jackson. Let's go, boy.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.525
Finally! Time for lunch.

06:00.225 --> 06:03.026
Let's go.
We can't be late again.

06:03.028 --> 06:03.729
You got that right.

06:06.431 --> 06:08.100
Yes, we beat Dad home.

06:09.599 --> 06:10.402
Peter! You're late.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.572
I told you not to be late
again today.

06:13.672 --> 06:15.806
Dad, I have a good excuse.
It was...

06:15.808 --> 06:17.510
Put your gear down.
Lunch is almost ready.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.253
Well, it's about time
you got here, Jackson.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.224
Sit on the couch or something.

06:31.556 --> 06:34.360
Ah, my favorite chair.

06:35.126 --> 06:36.326
You always have an excuse

06:36.328 --> 06:37.828
and I don't want to hear
your excuses anymore.

06:37.830 --> 06:38.862
But, Dad, I...

06:38.864 --> 06:41.234
Can't wait to hear
what he comes up with this time.

06:42.635 --> 06:46.102
I expect you had something to do
with Master Peter's tardiness.

06:46.104 --> 06:48.439
You're always getting him
into some sort of travesty

06:48.441 --> 06:50.275
with your shenanigans.

06:50.475 --> 06:53.779
Skateboarding? Really, Jackson,
when are you going to grow up?

06:54.746 --> 06:56.282
It wasn't my fault, "Greeny."

06:56.614 --> 06:59.182
Peter was having fun
and he lost track of time.

06:59.184 --> 07:00.783
And after what he's been through
this last year,

07:00.785 --> 07:02.221
he needs to enjoy himself.

07:03.621 --> 07:06.756
And you consider
that contraption to be fun?

07:06.758 --> 07:09.429
Perish the thought!

07:09.727 --> 07:12.664
I should never have let
you watch that <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

07:13.164 --> 07:15.667
Along with your accent,
you've become a snob.

07:17.436 --> 07:20.336
Hey Dad, why do you always
have a problem with me

07:20.338 --> 07:21.708
going to the skate park?

07:22.107 --> 07:24.174
If only his dad knew how much
he likes skateboarding

07:24.176 --> 07:25.245
and how it helps him.

07:26.311 --> 07:29.314
We both know the real issue is
he misses his mother.

07:29.614 --> 07:31.116
Yeah, Peabody,
you're right about that.

07:32.117 --> 07:33.519
I... I don't want to discuss it.

07:35.821 --> 07:37.756
It just helps me
get things off my mind.

07:40.859 --> 07:43.462
Look pal, I know it's been
a tough year.

07:44.229 --> 07:46.765
And I know you miss your mom.
I miss her, too.

07:48.167 --> 07:48.700
All right, but...

07:50.535 --> 07:52.304
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that

07:52.770 --> 07:54.706
I just want to see
my son once in a while.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.077
Okay, Dad.

07:58.376 --> 08:00.610
And remember, tomorrow
we gotta go to the cemetery

08:00.612 --> 08:02.612
for the one-year
memorial service.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.550
Your Aunt Niki and Uncle George
are going to be picking us up.

08:05.251 --> 08:08.619
Um, wait, why is Aunt Niki
picking us up?

08:08.621 --> 08:09.621
Don't we have our own car?

08:11.823 --> 08:15.792
Oh, right. Yeah,
well the car is in the shop.

08:15.794 --> 08:16.830
It's getting a tune-up.

08:17.963 --> 08:20.333
Do you think his dad will
come clean and tell the truth?

08:20.732 --> 08:24.300
Personally, I would have thought Master
Peter would have realized for himself.

08:24.302 --> 08:27.273
With the stereo missing,
along with the gym equipment.

08:28.374 --> 08:31.344
So, your Aunt Niki
is going to come and pick us up.

08:32.443 --> 08:34.614
What? She's nice.

08:35.413 --> 08:37.683
She's always patting my head.
What am I, a dog?

08:38.350 --> 08:40.416
She pats me on the head
like I'm a dog.

08:40.418 --> 08:42.489
I don't even do that to Jackson.
Haven't you seen her?

08:42.687 --> 08:43.889
Do I really have to go?

08:44.355 --> 08:47.226
Yes. I want you there.
It's important.

08:48.426 --> 08:51.661
And...
you be nice to your Aunt Niki.

08:51.663 --> 08:54.234
- I'll be on my best behavior.
- Thank you.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.966
Poor kid tries to cover it,

08:55.968 --> 08:57.537
but I know how much
he's still hurting.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.771
His mother
was a wonderful woman.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.274
She loved all animals.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.507
Thank goodness for us.

09:04.509 --> 09:06.879
You were one day away from...
you know what.

09:07.312 --> 09:09.715
And luckily,
when I was completely lost,

09:09.949 --> 09:12.152
I flew in her kitchen window.

09:12.484 --> 09:14.153
I'll never forget that day.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.221
And Peabody,
you've been a pain ever since.

09:17.223 --> 09:21.161
Oh, Jackson,
must we always bicker and fight?

09:22.393 --> 09:24.464
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwich?

09:24.729 --> 09:26.398
It's like the fourth time
this week.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.868
What? That's my specialty.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.473
Hey, come in.

09:37.575 --> 09:38.677
- Hey, Madison.
- What's up?

09:39.677 --> 09:41.346
Wanna do something?
I got my bike.

09:41.946 --> 09:44.750
Actually, I just made lunch.
You wanna join us?

09:45.383 --> 09:46.753
Wait, wait. Think this through.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.422
Only peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

09:50.755 --> 09:51.656
Sure. Thanks, Mr. Williams.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.860
See? There's somebody
who likes my sandwiches.

09:55.893 --> 09:59.499
Well, if it isn't the queen,
gracing us with her presence.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.366
Don't bother to get up, peasant.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.434
And when was the last time
you had a bath?

10:04.436 --> 10:05.971
I can smell you from over here.

10:07.672 --> 10:09.708
Oh, children. Must we?

10:09.907 --> 10:11.878
Oh, shut up, Peabody.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.584
This game is so easy.

10:17.782 --> 10:18.984
I'd like to see you try.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.318
Hey, I can skateboard.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.487
All you do is ride around
on Madison's bike in a basket.

10:24.489 --> 10:27.527
As if. I have no idea
what Peter sees in you.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.827
You've been spending a lot of
time in the skate park lately.

10:30.829 --> 10:32.529
Yeah. Working on my slides.

10:33.898 --> 10:35.064
What have you been up to?

10:35.066 --> 10:36.602
Riding my bike, you know?

10:37.436 --> 10:39.272
Sorry about your dad.

10:40.071 --> 10:42.738
Oh no. Oh no. This is not good.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.811
I hope she doesn't say
what I think she's gonna say.

10:45.777 --> 10:47.580
She's not gonna say anything.

10:47.879 --> 10:48.914
What about him?

10:49.949 --> 10:53.820
Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear.
Abort! Abort! Abort!

10:54.420 --> 10:56.923
This is not going to end well.
I just know it.

10:58.423 --> 11:00.393
You know... his business.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.093
Jackson! Bark, you fool. Bark!

11:03.095 --> 11:04.696
We need a distraction.

11:05.630 --> 11:06.862
Wait, what are you talking
about?

11:06.864 --> 11:08.000
My dad's the best private eye
in town.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.535
I know. It's just...

11:11.537 --> 11:14.773
Okay, fine.
"Ruff ruff." How's that?

11:15.974 --> 11:18.444
My mom told me he shut down his
office and moved everything out.

11:18.676 --> 11:19.979
Too late.

11:20.378 --> 11:22.581
Can't you dogs
do anything you're told?

11:22.880 --> 11:25.484
You just can't count
on a canine.

11:26.518 --> 11:27.818
Speak for yourself.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.023
Dogs can do everything better
than birds.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.959
What? He would've told me
something like that.

11:34.359 --> 11:36.428
I'm so sorry, Peter.
I thought you knew.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.830
Maybe I should just go home.

11:43.701 --> 11:44.537
Come on, Cleo.

11:47.605 --> 11:49.508
Now that he knows,
I wonder what Peter's gonna do.

11:50.075 --> 11:51.311
He is a good boy.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.613
I'm sure
he will think of something.

11:55.446 --> 11:56.948
All right, kiddo.
Let's get you ready for bed.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.051
Dad, is everything all right?

12:00.451 --> 12:01.320
Yeah, it's great. Why?

12:02.620 --> 12:05.524
Madison said
you closed down the office.

12:05.957 --> 12:07.893
Why would you do something
like that and not tell me?

12:12.898 --> 12:13.965
I'm not a kid anymore.

12:16.869 --> 12:17.570
I know.

12:20.705 --> 12:21.606
I should've told you.

12:23.841 --> 12:25.610
Business has been slow.

12:26.744 --> 12:28.447
Maybe my heart
hasn't been in it, you know...

12:29.080 --> 12:30.015
ever since your mom...

12:32.183 --> 12:33.485
She was always the one
that supported me.

12:34.820 --> 12:35.787
That went well I think.

12:36.053 --> 12:37.089
What about you, Peabody?

12:38.124 --> 12:40.726
The best it could be...
all things considered.

12:41.192 --> 12:42.427
It's okay, Dad.

12:42.927 --> 12:44.527
You just have to pick
yourself up,

12:44.529 --> 12:46.798
dust yourself off,
and laugh about it.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.768
That's what Mom
would say, right?

12:50.835 --> 12:52.037
Are you sure you're only 11?

12:53.772 --> 12:54.941
Your mom would be
so proud of you.

12:57.643 --> 12:58.945
Dad, what's debt?

12:59.510 --> 13:00.910
Are we out of money?

13:00.912 --> 13:04.647
Is that why you sold the car
and all the other stuff?

13:04.649 --> 13:06.549
Look, I don't want you to worry
about that, okay, buddy?

13:06.551 --> 13:07.586
Everything's gonna be just fine.

13:08.854 --> 13:09.888
- Okay?
- Yeah.

13:10.888 --> 13:12.959
Dad... I have an idea.

13:13.825 --> 13:16.729
Why don't you open the office
back up in the garage?

13:17.562 --> 13:19.499
There's plenty of room there,
now that we don't have a car.

13:21.466 --> 13:22.801
I mean,
I'll even help you clean up.

13:23.134 --> 13:25.801
Now that might be
just the thing to do.

13:25.803 --> 13:27.838
The boy is such a clever lad.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.575
Thank goodness
he takes after his mother.

13:32.710 --> 13:33.979
You know, that's not a bad idea.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.514
That's not a bad idea at all.

13:37.516 --> 13:39.118
And actually,
we have all the furniture here.

13:40.118 --> 13:41.617
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

13:41.619 --> 13:42.721
Why don't we get started
on that tomorrow.

13:43.154 --> 13:45.856
- All right, yeah.
- Oh! But right now,

13:45.858 --> 13:47.627
it is time for you, sir, to go to bed.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.059
All right, now,
make sure to brush your teeth.

13:50.061 --> 13:51.062
I'll be back in a few minutes.

13:52.630 --> 13:53.131
Jackson.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.738
- Goodnight, boy.
- Peabody...

13:58.970 --> 14:02.506
I do think things at the Connor
house just might turn around.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.676
Yes, indeed.

14:04.142 --> 14:06.212
But tomorrow will not be easy.

14:06.945 --> 14:08.047
Let's get some sleep.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.197
Oh, I hate
to see Peter like this.

14:24.595 --> 14:26.795
He needs to get out
and get back on his board.

14:26.797 --> 14:28.631
I agree.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.702
Going to the cemetery was not
an easy thing for him to do.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.975
Thank you so much for coming.
It was really good to see you.

14:38.009 --> 14:38.843
Take care.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.782
Thank you.
George, honey, it's time to go.

14:44.582 --> 14:45.984
Connor, do you need any help
cleaning up?

14:47.051 --> 14:49.087
No, I think Peter
and I can manage.

14:49.787 --> 14:51.887
You know, it was great to see
you and George, and catch up.

14:51.889 --> 14:53.756
Today's service
was just beautiful.

14:53.758 --> 14:55.260
There were over 50 people there.

14:56.695 --> 14:57.794
She had so many friends.

15:00.599 --> 15:03.636
And you... I cannot believe
how much you've grown, kiddo.

15:05.202 --> 15:07.102
And there it is.

15:07.104 --> 15:09.175
I really wish you would rethink
George's offer to come work for him.

15:09.641 --> 15:11.878
The famous
"Aunt Niki Head Pat."

15:12.210 --> 15:14.946
You and I both know that the
PI business is too fickle.

15:15.279 --> 15:16.948
You need security.

15:17.181 --> 15:19.851
Aunt Niki has no idea
what Carol would have wanted.

15:20.752 --> 15:21.988
Connor, stay strong.

15:24.122 --> 15:25.157
Think of Peter's future.

15:26.191 --> 15:27.593
It's what Carol would want.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.630
Niki,
I know you mean well...

15:32.598 --> 15:34.667
but to be honest with you,
I can't.

15:36.599 --> 15:38.671
And, I really don't think Carol
would've wanted me to.

15:40.205 --> 15:42.208
Look, things are gonna pick up,
okay? I promise.

15:43.808 --> 15:45.143
Okay, come here.

15:46.945 --> 15:48.180
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.314
Thanks for coming, George.
I appreciate it, man.

16:09.066 --> 16:11.266
All right, little man,
what do you say you and I

16:11.268 --> 16:12.604
start cleaning this place up?

16:13.404 --> 16:14.038
Or not.

16:16.742 --> 16:20.713
Okay. Then what do you say...

16:21.846 --> 16:23.949
you and I start working
on that garage idea of yours?

16:26.884 --> 16:29.054
You're right, Dad.
Things will start to pick up.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.087
I just know it.

16:31.089 --> 16:32.825
I hope you're right.

16:33.090 --> 16:34.256
"You just know it."

16:34.258 --> 16:36.059
Boy, that was close.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.828
I thought Connor might actually
take the offer.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.334
Not this bird.
I knew things would work out.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.136
Connor loves
being a private investigator.

16:44.802 --> 16:46.172
And he is very good at it.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.608
Peter's mother knew
he loved doing it.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.109
And that is why
she supported him.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.350
Oh man... what a mess.

16:59.283 --> 17:00.883
Yeah.

17:00.885 --> 17:02.151
Where do you think
we should get started?

17:02.153 --> 17:03.022
I'll take the mower.

17:03.754 --> 17:07.059
Okay. I will take the TV.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.892
- All right.
- Sound good?

17:08.894 --> 17:10.127
- Yeah. Great.
- All right, let's get started.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.339
Yeah.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.240
It's not bad
for a garage-slash-office, huh?

17:54.872 --> 17:56.806
Dad, this is temporary.

17:56.808 --> 17:59.412
You're going to be back
into a normal office in no time.

18:00.445 --> 18:01.446
You know, I hope you're right.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.849
Oh, wait.

18:05.216 --> 18:06.418
Check out my new flyer.
What do you think?

18:07.552 --> 18:10.286
I love it. How about you,
Jackson? Do you like that?

18:10.288 --> 18:12.825
- You like it, Jack?
- Ah, yeah, he loves it.

18:13.058 --> 18:16.158
I hope so,
Connor stinks at advertising.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.697
Yes, Carol was the smart one.

18:19.030 --> 18:20.763
Taking out all those ads.

18:20.765 --> 18:22.734
It's funny,
Connor never caught on.

18:22.934 --> 18:25.335
Carol wanted him to think
he did it all himself.

18:25.337 --> 18:27.406
That was her way
of doing things.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.776
Yeah. Okay.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.346
- Not bad.
- Come on, Jackson, let's go.

18:37.081 --> 18:39.984
This time, Connor is going
to need a little extra help.

18:40.351 --> 18:42.851
And I know just what Carol
would do.

18:42.853 --> 18:45.757
Now, to get Jackson on board
with the idea.

18:48.392 --> 18:50.361
All right,
we have to do something now.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.195
Don't worry, my canine friend,

18:53.197 --> 18:54.396
I have a plan.

19:05.076 --> 19:06.946
You think this plan of yours
is gonna work?

19:07.344 --> 19:08.379
Of course it will.

19:08.813 --> 19:10.081
Oh, smart guy.

19:10.381 --> 19:11.950
When did you learn how to type?

19:12.149 --> 19:13.518
Actually, it's quite easy.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.989
I pay attention.
You should try it sometime.

19:17.455 --> 19:20.426
And, in this case...
claws beat paws.

19:21.059 --> 19:22.427
Hey, watch it, "Feathers."

19:23.528 --> 19:26.365
Now, it's time to get
these flyers distributed.

19:27.064 --> 19:28.463
Off I go!

19:31.269 --> 19:33.405
Hey, take a flyer. Check it out.

19:37.542 --> 19:40.446
Here they come!
Falling from the sky!

19:42.981 --> 19:45.184
Kid, get off your phone
and try reading.

19:51.555 --> 19:53.359
Flyers for everyone!

19:54.225 --> 19:55.226
This is actually fun.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.562
I'm exhausted.

19:58.029 --> 20:00.029
This better bring in
some business.

20:00.031 --> 20:02.498
I do hope they get some business
for Connor,

20:02.500 --> 20:05.068
or Connor and Peter
will be out on the street.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.906
And that means us as well.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.874
I hear that.

21:12.303 --> 21:15.504
Okay, okay. I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

21:30.021 --> 21:31.020
Connor Williams?

21:31.022 --> 21:33.021
Yeah. Yeah, Hi. Please...

21:33.023 --> 21:34.359
Good morning.
Katherine Worthington.

21:34.559 --> 21:35.594
Please... Please, come in.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.196
Have a seat.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.970
How can I help you,
Miss Worthington?

21:46.471 --> 21:49.108
Mr. Williams...
You're my last hope.

21:50.007 --> 21:51.409
Well, I'm flattered
to be your last hope.

21:51.676 --> 21:53.244
No, I didn't mean it that way.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.113
I came in as soon as I could.

21:55.612 --> 21:57.682
I see she has one of our flyers.

21:58.116 --> 21:59.952
I wonder
what she needs investigated.

22:00.685 --> 22:02.922
She certainly is attractive.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.090
Well... how can I help you?

22:05.389 --> 22:08.026
My name's Katherine,
Katherine Worthington.

22:09.526 --> 22:14.667
You mean... like Worthingtons
that own half of this town?

22:15.265 --> 22:17.602
In fact, I know that's the
reason no one will take my case.

22:19.471 --> 22:20.506
Will you?

22:22.173 --> 22:23.575
Well, that depends.
What's the case?

22:24.641 --> 22:26.044
This is about a death.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.613
Death? Oh my goodness.

22:30.048 --> 22:31.215
You talking about murder?

22:32.082 --> 22:34.018
My Great Aunt Sally
passed away recently.

22:34.452 --> 22:35.654
She was in her 90s.

22:36.654 --> 22:38.691
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

22:39.224 --> 22:40.426
The problem is, the will.

22:41.025 --> 22:42.457
I know it's been changed,
or switched,

22:42.459 --> 22:43.661
without my aunt's knowledge.

22:45.696 --> 22:48.563
So, I take it you were expecting to
inherit a lot of money from your aunt,

22:48.565 --> 22:50.299
and she wound up
leaving you nothing.

22:50.301 --> 22:52.538
This isn't about money.
This is about what's right.

22:54.105 --> 22:56.672
At the reading of the will,
I was shocked to learn

22:56.674 --> 22:58.711
that Uncle Forrest
had been left everything.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.644
I know that's not what
my aunt wanted.

23:01.646 --> 23:04.282
She never trusted Forrest.
He's a crook.

23:04.482 --> 23:07.653
Oh, this sounds interesting.
And she is a looker.

23:08.453 --> 23:11.757
She told me she'd hid a copy of the
original will inside the mansion.

23:12.823 --> 23:14.525
But my uncle won't allow me in.

23:15.292 --> 23:17.428
Everyone in this town
is afraid of my uncle.

23:18.362 --> 23:19.230
Are you?

23:21.698 --> 23:23.134
I don't know what else I can do.

23:24.401 --> 23:25.536
You're my only hope.

23:33.677 --> 23:34.713
Okay.

23:36.313 --> 23:37.515
We have to be smart about this.

23:38.649 --> 23:40.319
Do you have any idea
where your aunt hid the will?

23:41.485 --> 23:42.754
Unfortunately, no.

23:47.725 --> 23:49.293
Look, I can't promise anything.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.295
I know. That's okay. Um...

23:52.629 --> 23:55.231
is 5,000 enough
to get you started?

23:55.233 --> 23:57.834
Five grand?
That'll come in handy.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.505
You know how many tennis balls
I could buy?

24:00.839 --> 24:03.042
Yes.
That's great. Yeah.

24:04.341 --> 24:06.477
Thank you, Mr. Williams.
And please be careful.

24:07.111 --> 24:08.714
My uncle isn't one
to be trusted.

24:09.414 --> 24:10.512
Well, please, call me Connor,

24:10.514 --> 24:12.815
and I'll be in touch as soon
as I hear anything at all.

24:12.817 --> 24:14.686
- Thank you.
- You got it. Bye-bye.

24:27.432 --> 24:30.536
- Who was that?
- That was my new client.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.271
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.074
Yeah. Just keep your fingers
crossed I can help her out.

24:36.307 --> 24:39.078
See, Dad? I told you things
would get better.

24:39.276 --> 24:40.475
You were right, pal.

24:40.477 --> 24:41.844
- Come on, Jackson.
- Come on. Let's go, buddy.

24:41.846 --> 24:43.515
- Let's go.
- Come on.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.384
I've got
to discuss this with Jackson.

24:48.386 --> 24:50.819
It's not going to be easy.

24:50.821 --> 24:54.290
What's the problem? This
is an open-and-shut case for Connor.

24:54.292 --> 24:57.393
Oh, Jackson, you should try
watching the news for once,

24:57.395 --> 25:00.463
instead of galivanting about
on your skateboard.

25:00.465 --> 25:04.269
Connor is going up against the
richest, most powerful man in town.

25:34.565 --> 25:35.833
Hey, Peter, I'll be right back.

26:35.726 --> 26:36.661
What do you want?

26:37.561 --> 26:39.462
Um, yeah, hi.
My name is Connor Williams.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.899
Um, I'd like to talk
to Mr. Worthington, please.

26:42.399 --> 26:43.936
Youse and everybody else
in this town.

26:45.903 --> 26:47.306
What do you want
with Mr. Worthington?

26:48.572 --> 26:49.840
Could you let him know that I'm a
friend of his niece Katherine?

26:53.578 --> 26:54.413
Wait here.

27:16.801 --> 27:17.836
Follow me.

27:18.802 --> 27:20.606
Don't touch nothing.

27:31.948 --> 27:32.950
Nice day out.

27:33.951 --> 27:35.854
I don't know nothing about that.

27:36.721 --> 27:38.290
You don't know nothing
about what?

27:38.523 --> 27:40.926
The weather. He's asking me
about the weather.

27:41.458 --> 27:43.794
- Just making small talk.
- Well, don't. Let's go.

27:57.542 --> 27:58.609
Here he is, boss.

28:03.481 --> 28:04.583
Ah.

28:05.015 --> 28:06.484
I understand you know my niece?

28:06.818 --> 28:08.451
I... Yes, sir.

28:08.453 --> 28:10.022
And, this would concern me how?

28:11.688 --> 28:14.725
Katherine came to me concerning
her Great Aunt Sally's will.

28:16.026 --> 28:17.592
Well, you see,
I'm a private investigator,

28:17.594 --> 28:19.463
and she's asked me
to look into the matter.

28:20.398 --> 28:23.702
Well, she has reason to believe
that the will is a... a fake.

28:26.103 --> 28:29.807
Well... I knew she would eventually
find somebody to believe her story.

28:30.808 --> 28:32.811
She can be quite convincing,
I can tell you.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.480
Katherine is persistent,
I'll give her that.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.482
But she's also quite delusional.

28:39.783 --> 28:43.418
Well... based on the fact
that her great aunt

28:43.420 --> 28:45.387
promised her this property
and this house,

28:45.389 --> 28:48.326
now she feels that the will
was changed or altered.

28:50.026 --> 28:53.028
Mr. Williams, I think you need
to drop this investigation.

28:53.030 --> 28:56.398
You see, my aunt really wasn't
in her right mind at the end,

28:56.400 --> 28:58.869
but I assure you, there's been
no tampering with any will.

28:59.936 --> 29:01.639
What you're dealing with
here is just a...

29:02.173 --> 29:04.676
a bitter, young lady
who feels betrayed.

29:05.842 --> 29:07.742
Is there any proof
that your great aunt

29:07.744 --> 29:08.946
was not of sound mind?

29:11.882 --> 29:13.017
Good day, Mr. Williams.

29:13.517 --> 29:14.752
Clyde, show Mr. Williams out.

29:18.688 --> 29:19.690
If you're smart...

29:20.425 --> 29:21.589
you'll listen
to Mr. Worthington.

29:21.591 --> 29:22.960
But, I'm not done
with Mr. Worthington.

29:23.660 --> 29:26.697
If not for yourself...
for your son.

29:27.898 --> 29:29.066
What do you know about my son?

29:29.466 --> 29:31.466
Mr. Worthington makes it
his business to know

29:31.468 --> 29:32.670
everything that
goes on in this town.

29:33.538 --> 29:34.373
Remember that.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.075
Stay away from Mr. Worthington.

30:22.820 --> 30:24.156
- Has she been eating?
- She's eating good.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.725
Okay, does she have
a temperature?

30:26.991 --> 30:28.723
It was normal, 101.1.

30:29.926 --> 30:30.962
Sorry.

30:32.763 --> 30:33.631
Hello?

30:34.532 --> 30:37.098
Dr. Worthington?
Hey, it's Connor Williams.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.936
Did you speak with my uncle?

30:39.536 --> 30:41.604
I did, but... you know, I would
rather talk to you about this,

30:41.606 --> 30:42.808
if I could, face-to-face.

30:43.139 --> 30:46.174
I don't like this.
Connor looks upset.

30:46.176 --> 30:48.179
My guess is, this is not good.

30:48.646 --> 30:50.949
Is everything all right?
Did you find out anything?

30:51.549 --> 30:52.917
Just as soon
as you can get here.

30:54.017 --> 30:56.954
Okay... I'll be right there.

30:57.687 --> 30:58.689
Thanks.

31:11.903 --> 31:12.971
Take care of that.

31:14.671 --> 31:16.607
- Clyde?
- What?

31:18.975 --> 31:19.811
Sorry, boss.

31:23.113 --> 31:25.013
Okay, first stop's gonna be
the mayor's office.

31:25.015 --> 31:26.784
And I wanna go
to the construction site.

31:27.217 --> 31:29.918
I gotta make sure that all those
squatters have been evicted

31:29.920 --> 31:30.955
and are out of my buildings.

31:31.688 --> 31:33.655
I hate when people...
You tell them,

31:33.657 --> 31:35.494
legally, they gotta move,
and they refuse.

31:35.792 --> 31:36.794
I don't understand these people.

31:37.794 --> 31:38.964
Boss...

31:40.432 --> 31:42.033
some of them people have lived and
worked there their entire lives.

31:42.766 --> 31:44.535
You just threw them out
like garbage.

31:44.801 --> 31:46.605
You even made me throw out
my own grand-mama.

31:47.003 --> 31:48.303
And that was not easy to do.

31:48.305 --> 31:49.338
That woman's stronger
than she looks.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.975
I still got bruises to prove it.

31:51.943 --> 31:53.677
I pay you to do a job, Clyde.

31:54.645 --> 31:56.845
Your family issues
are not my concern.

31:56.847 --> 31:58.750
But it was youse who told me
to throw her out.

31:59.817 --> 32:00.752
And your point would be...

32:02.119 --> 32:03.687
Sorry, Mr. Worthington, nothing.

32:06.023 --> 32:07.292
Hey, why do we need to go
to the mayor's?

32:08.792 --> 32:10.594
Not that it's any
of your business...

32:11.061 --> 32:14.733
but I've got to make sure that every
detail of my plans are in place.

32:15.232 --> 32:18.133
I've got too much money and time
invested in this venture

32:18.135 --> 32:19.170
to have something happen now.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.071
What could happen now?

32:21.606 --> 32:23.071
Are you forgetting
our little visit

32:23.073 --> 32:25.310
from that idiot PI
that my niece hired?

32:26.343 --> 32:31.046
Who does he think he is, coming
into my house, snooping around,

32:31.048 --> 32:33.218
questioning me
like an interrogator?

32:33.884 --> 32:36.221
I think my niece, Katherine,
must be losing her mind.

32:40.858 --> 32:41.926
You know...

32:43.093 --> 32:45.129
I should probably have my doctor
check on her mental state.

32:46.129 --> 32:48.099
She might need the help
of a psychiatrist.

32:50.234 --> 32:51.903
- Or better yet...
- What?

32:53.204 --> 32:54.705
We could have her committed.

32:55.805 --> 32:56.975
For her own good,
of course. But,

32:58.042 --> 33:00.078
that would get her
out of my hair, permanently.

33:01.911 --> 33:03.378
Walking around,
"Miss High and Mighty"

33:03.380 --> 33:05.149
like she's better
than everybody else.

33:06.149 --> 33:07.284
She's nothing but a pest.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.287
You got that right.

33:11.121 --> 33:12.791
Must be hard
being youse.

33:17.328 --> 33:20.197
Clyde... you have no idea.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.848
Hey, Dad, everything okay?

33:38.748 --> 33:40.684
Yeah. Yeah, buddy,
everything's fine.

33:41.785 --> 33:42.821
Hey, Jacks.

33:43.821 --> 33:44.686
So, did you get
your homework finished?

33:44.688 --> 33:46.390
Yeah, I'm starving, Dad.
When can we eat?

33:49.025 --> 33:52.126
Um, you know what? I tell you
what, why don't you go inside,

33:52.128 --> 33:54.963
and get yourself ready, and I'll fix you
something to eat, in a few minutes.

33:54.965 --> 33:56.266
I need to see this client, okay?

33:57.033 --> 33:58.035
All right.

33:58.903 --> 33:59.738
Come on, Jackson.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.811
Katherine, I'm so sorry
to make you come over here.

34:07.410 --> 34:08.212
What happened?

34:09.112 --> 34:10.380
I had a conversation
with your uncle today.

34:10.781 --> 34:12.282
Let me guess,
he denied everything?

34:13.016 --> 34:13.618
Not exactly.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.753
He took me to his study and...

34:16.319 --> 34:19.422
basically told me I needed
to drop this case, or else.

34:19.989 --> 34:21.324
Well, I'm not surprised.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.326
Look, Katherine, I just wanted to let you
know that, while I was in the office,

34:25.328 --> 34:27.031
I saw on the bookshelf
one of those...

34:27.964 --> 34:30.000
false books, you know,
that you can hide things in.

34:30.433 --> 34:32.300
Do you think that's
where she hid the will?

34:32.302 --> 34:33.672
It's possible.

34:34.938 --> 34:36.273
But, see, the thing is, that I
can't get in there to find out.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.074
So...

34:38.875 --> 34:40.375
I'm sorry
to tell you that

34:40.377 --> 34:42.047
I'm gonna have to drop
your case.

34:42.980 --> 34:46.317
And... I would highly recommend
that you do the same.

34:46.984 --> 34:48.152
I'm not afraid of my uncle.

34:49.185 --> 34:50.954
And I refuse to be bullied
by him.

34:51.288 --> 34:53.190
Look, Katherine... please.

34:56.025 --> 34:57.395
Just... thank you for trying.

35:00.331 --> 35:01.433
I'm so sorry, Katherine.

35:09.239 --> 35:10.908
I don't know
about this PI thing, pal.

35:14.511 --> 35:17.047
Who does this Worthington
fellow think he is?

35:17.348 --> 35:18.880
He must have said
something terrible

35:18.882 --> 35:20.350
to get Connor to drop the case.

35:20.951 --> 35:22.887
I agree.
We have to do something.

35:23.453 --> 35:26.023
Well, it would help if I knew
what we were looking for.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.860
Anything to do
with this Worthington guy.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.328
We have to do something.

35:40.237 --> 35:42.373
Peabody... how?

35:43.139 --> 35:45.777
It's easy...
once you get the hang of it.

35:46.409 --> 35:47.811
We have to find that will.

35:48.045 --> 35:49.514
It must be somewhere
in the study.

35:50.181 --> 35:53.014
Wow, I am impressed with your
computer skills, Peabody.

35:53.016 --> 35:54.384
Where did you learn
to do it?

35:54.951 --> 35:57.321
Oh, I have all sorts
of hidden talents.

35:58.188 --> 35:59.389
We need to help my dad.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.359
But we need
a little bit more manpower.

36:03.226 --> 36:04.962
This might actually be fun.

36:05.496 --> 36:06.531
You can say that again.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.801
But the most important thing
is to keep Peter safe.

36:11.235 --> 36:12.070
I need your help.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.505
Cool. See you in ten.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.375
Come on, Jackson.

36:42.498 --> 36:46.034
Hey, Cleo. How are you doing
in your basket?

36:46.036 --> 36:48.203
Aren't you afraid you might
get your nails dirty?

36:48.205 --> 36:51.540
As if. Jackson,
you are such a bore sometimes.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.976
Now, why are we not doing this
during the day?

36:53.978 --> 36:56.514
I trust Peter. He's smart.
He has a plan.

37:28.212 --> 37:29.880
This place is creepy.

37:31.248 --> 37:32.616
And just how do you think we're
going to sneak into a mansion?

37:33.616 --> 37:35.385
Don't worry, I have a plan.

37:37.353 --> 37:39.654
Great. Peter has a plan.

37:39.656 --> 37:42.159
He's a kid.
What kind of plan can he have?

37:43.159 --> 37:44.628
You're a fool
if you go along with this.

37:45.496 --> 37:47.094
We have to do it for Connor.

37:47.096 --> 37:48.899
I would suggest you tag along,

37:49.132 --> 37:51.002
but I'm sure you have
a nail appointment.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.505
Whether I go or not,
has nothing to do with you.

37:55.105 --> 37:58.139
If you think I'd leave Madison's
safety in your hands,

37:58.141 --> 38:00.041
you're even dumber
than I thought.

38:00.043 --> 38:02.710
Oh, please you two,
stop bickering.

38:02.712 --> 38:06.283
If this plan is going to work,
we need to be united.

38:06.683 --> 38:08.919
At least try to get along.

38:09.686 --> 38:11.221
He's like, impossible.

38:13.022 --> 38:14.391
I'd feel better
if I knew the plan.

38:15.259 --> 38:17.661
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, Jackson.

38:20.096 --> 38:21.198
Stealthy ninja!

38:26.737 --> 38:28.406
I wonder what those kids
are up to.

38:32.042 --> 38:35.446
Okay, so...
how are we getting in?

38:35.980 --> 38:37.949
Actually, I'm not so sure.

38:38.348 --> 38:39.549
You're not sure?

38:40.217 --> 38:43.021
Well... I thought
by the time we made it...

38:43.654 --> 38:44.656
that I would've figured it out.

38:47.690 --> 38:50.093
Well, isn't this just great.

38:50.293 --> 38:53.031
Give Peter a little time.
He'll figure this out.

38:53.730 --> 38:56.264
Sure, if we're not all eaten
by wild animals,

38:56.266 --> 38:58.036
or arrested for trespassing.

38:59.235 --> 39:01.973
Please, will you both
try to remain positive?

39:02.672 --> 39:04.574
I just want to help my dad
solve this case.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.612
Yeah, but... Okay.

39:09.380 --> 39:10.648
Let's figure this out.

39:11.147 --> 39:12.683
All right,
let's check the windows.

39:20.757 --> 39:23.160
Hey, my name's Roscoe.
What's your name?

39:23.560 --> 39:24.594
I'm Jackson.

39:25.194 --> 39:26.697
Oh yeah, and she's Cleo.

39:28.065 --> 39:29.701
I've been living here
for a while.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.069
This nice old lady
was taking care of me.

39:32.368 --> 39:34.369
But now she's gone,
and these two tough guys

39:34.371 --> 39:35.540
keep me tied up in the back.

39:36.172 --> 39:38.639
I hate to tell you this,
but the nice lady died.

39:38.641 --> 39:40.677
and now we've gotta find a way
to get inside the house.

39:42.045 --> 39:44.448
Oh... I just might be able
to help.

39:45.214 --> 39:46.717
The side door
is usually unlocked.

39:47.451 --> 39:50.487
Thanks, buddy.
Sorry for your loss

39:51.455 --> 39:53.190
Oh no, the poor boy.

39:54.824 --> 39:57.058
- You must be starving.
- Jackson, what are you doing?

39:57.060 --> 39:58.092
Stop!
You're gonna get us caught!

39:58.094 --> 40:00.031
Well, hello there.

40:00.464 --> 40:03.234
Now that we're alone,
what's your name, beautiful?

40:03.801 --> 40:05.132
Stop right there.

40:05.134 --> 40:07.168
You did your good deed
for the day.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.339
Why don't we just leave it
at that?

40:09.206 --> 40:12.777
Oh! Playing hard to get?
I like that.

40:13.444 --> 40:15.279
When was the last time
you took a bath?

40:15.679 --> 40:18.182
- Does rain count?
- In your case? No.

40:19.148 --> 40:21.284
I hope they don't trip
the alarm system.

40:21.518 --> 40:23.117
Alarm system?

40:23.119 --> 40:25.322
You idiot!
Madison better be all right.

40:26.723 --> 40:28.259
How'd you know, Jackson?

40:29.326 --> 40:30.795
Roscoe was right,
the door was unlocked.

40:34.397 --> 40:35.232
Let's look around.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.369
Where do you think
the will is?

40:38.668 --> 40:39.503
I'm not sure.

40:42.438 --> 40:44.375
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

40:45.141 --> 40:47.576
I'll have you know, I watched
every single <i>Scooby-Doo</i> episode

40:47.578 --> 40:48.513
at least twice.

40:48.811 --> 40:50.447
This is what they'd exactly do.

40:51.581 --> 40:53.181
You do realize that's a cartoon?

40:53.183 --> 40:54.451
Doesn't mean it's not real.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.054
Let's go here.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.556
Wait. Hold up.

41:07.197 --> 41:07.832
Double up.

41:16.672 --> 41:17.707
Go! Go! Go!

41:24.248 --> 41:26.484
Who's ever down there,
show yourself. We're armed.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.219
Clyde, we're not armed.

41:28.485 --> 41:30.121
The guns
are in the study downstairs.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.587
Shut up. Who's ever down there
doesn't know that.

41:33.589 --> 41:34.624
Come on.

41:40.697 --> 41:41.532
Go! Go! Go!

41:51.875 --> 41:53.210
That didn't go well.

42:01.217 --> 42:02.817
- Sorry, mate.
- Dude, watch where you're going.

42:02.819 --> 42:05.353
But it's ever since you started
that diet

42:05.355 --> 42:06.824
you're not easy to see.

42:07.757 --> 42:08.792
Well, I...

42:10.360 --> 42:12.163
I wonder if it was
that PI guy from today.

42:13.764 --> 42:16.234
In fact, I'm gonna call it in...

42:16.766 --> 42:19.669
I'm gonna tell them
it was that PI guy.

42:20.670 --> 42:21.471
But, Clyde...

42:22.239 --> 42:23.541
there was no break-in.

42:23.973 --> 42:25.408
We didn't see anyone.

42:25.976 --> 42:27.811
Maybe the alarms just went off.

42:32.549 --> 42:34.886
Oh... I get it.

42:36.353 --> 42:37.855
Boss, use my phone.

42:42.893 --> 42:46.330
Good heavens!
Oh, those lying buffoons.

42:46.830 --> 42:49.500
I must report this to Jackson
without delay.

42:50.933 --> 42:52.669
Yeah, there was a break-in
at Forrest's place.

42:55.906 --> 42:56.607
Okay.

42:57.741 --> 42:58.876
Can I have my phone, Clyde?

42:59.509 --> 43:00.277
Clyde?

43:01.011 --> 43:01.846
Clyde?

43:08.585 --> 43:11.319
Remind me when you come
up with a brilliant idea, to pass.

43:11.321 --> 43:13.523
- I'm really sorry, Madison!
- It's okay!

43:13.723 --> 43:15.725
I'm super-sorry!

43:16.259 --> 43:18.528
I guess maybe I should have
mentioned that alarm after all.

43:20.529 --> 43:22.232
I hope they come back.

43:22.498 --> 43:25.770
Especially that Cleo.
She is a looker!

43:26.703 --> 43:28.306
Not sure about the attitude,
though.

43:34.677 --> 43:35.645
That was close.

43:37.748 --> 43:40.484
Peter? Did you see
those guys on the porch?

43:41.317 --> 43:43.787
They looked really mean,
and super-mad.

43:44.821 --> 43:45.690
I didn't see anyone.

43:46.889 --> 43:48.292
Are you sure you saw anyone?

43:49.625 --> 43:51.394
Yes, I saw them.

43:51.895 --> 43:54.864
This is a crazy idea from the start.
We could've gotten hurt.

44:01.337 --> 44:02.540
I think those guys
even had guns.

44:05.475 --> 44:07.944
Let's go to your place,
and figure out our next move.

44:24.860 --> 44:25.895
Come on, girl.

44:27.663 --> 44:29.466
That was actually kind of fun.

44:30.634 --> 44:32.336
Fun? How was that fun?

44:32.802 --> 44:34.501
We almost got caught.

44:34.503 --> 44:35.505
Do you know
what might have happened?

44:35.938 --> 44:39.310
We could all get grounded.
Or worse, go to jail.

44:40.344 --> 44:41.775
That was just the first time.

44:41.777 --> 44:42.913
I'll have a new plan
by tomorrow.

44:44.815 --> 44:46.848
Peter, I'm so tired
of your plans.

44:46.850 --> 44:47.817
They always go wrong.

44:48.485 --> 44:49.654
And this time was the worst.

44:50.721 --> 44:51.554
I'm done.

44:52.288 --> 44:54.357
Madison,
nothing really happened.

44:55.491 --> 44:57.594
It'll be better next time,
I promise.

44:58.527 --> 45:01.631
Next time.
There will be no next time.

45:02.465 --> 45:03.900
I cannot get into
any more trouble

45:04.500 --> 45:05.969
So, I don't think
we should hang out anymore.

45:07.670 --> 45:10.875
Madison, we're friends. And
friends stick together, right?

45:13.877 --> 45:14.945
No more crazy plans.

45:16.413 --> 45:18.449
Bye, Peter. Just go home.

45:29.893 --> 45:31.962
Things have gone
from bad to worse.

45:32.561 --> 45:35.398
Indeed. We may have reached
DEFCON One.

45:35.998 --> 45:38.500
I overheard
those two goons talking.

45:38.502 --> 45:40.804
They called the police,
and reported a break-in.

45:41.138 --> 45:42.873
Even said things
were stolen.

45:43.607 --> 45:46.476
But worst of all,
they're going to blame Connor.

45:47.177 --> 45:49.610
The police
will never believe that story.

45:50.580 --> 45:51.047
Who could that be?

45:57.154 --> 45:59.056
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

46:00.089 --> 46:01.491
Keep your pants on.

46:05.494 --> 46:06.397
Are you Connor Williams?

46:06.962 --> 46:08.698
Yes, I am.

46:08.998 --> 46:10.967
I'm Detective Harris. This is
my partner, Detective Brown.

46:11.634 --> 46:13.634
We need to ask you a couple
questions about a break-in

46:13.636 --> 46:14.839
that occurred last night
at the Worthington mansion.

46:15.505 --> 46:18.876
Um... yeah, sure. Come on in.

46:24.047 --> 46:26.117
Where were you last night, between
the hours of 6 and 7 p.m.?

46:26.917 --> 46:28.418
I was making dinner.

46:29.085 --> 46:30.121
Can anyone verify that?

46:30.719 --> 46:32.756
Uh, no.

46:32.956 --> 46:35.393
My son was playing with his friend.
I was home alone.

46:36.058 --> 46:37.558
Peabody, you're right.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.028
The police are here
questioning Connor.

46:41.931 --> 46:44.032
Mr. Williams, we have
eyewitness statements that claim

46:44.034 --> 46:45.802
you were at the Worthington
mansion at that time.

46:47.036 --> 46:49.837
Uh, that's impossible,
because, like I told you

46:49.839 --> 46:52.206
I... I-- Nobody could have
seen me there, I was here.

46:52.208 --> 46:54.641
I'm sorry, sir,
but if nobody can verify that

46:54.643 --> 46:56.980
you're gonna have to come
with us for further questioning.

46:57.913 --> 46:59.149
Am I being arrested?

46:59.982 --> 47:01.616
No, sir. Not at this time.

47:01.618 --> 47:03.186
We just need to ask
you a few more questions.

47:04.087 --> 47:04.989
Hey, Peter, can you come here?

47:08.991 --> 47:10.657
Hey, bud, listen, um,

47:10.659 --> 47:12.226
I need to go with these detectives
to clear a few things up.

47:12.228 --> 47:14.165
Do you mind just hanging out here
for an hour until I get back?

47:15.098 --> 47:16.100
- Sure, yeah.
- Okay, great.

47:17.667 --> 47:18.201
Um...

47:19.168 --> 47:21.038
Do you mind
if I change my clothes first?

47:21.605 --> 47:23.873
- Sure.
- Thanks, I'll be right back.

47:29.846 --> 47:32.817
Jim, did you really have to call
backup to take that guy in?

47:33.215 --> 47:34.181
It's kind of overkill, isn't it?

47:34.183 --> 47:36.519
Like I said, they come
in all shapes and sizes.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.955
Plus, I think we need
to make an example of this one.

47:40.589 --> 47:42.056
What do you mean by, "example?"

47:42.058 --> 47:43.724
You and I both know
that Forrest Worthington

47:43.726 --> 47:45.495
is the most important man
in this town.

47:45.895 --> 47:48.061
Look at the mall he's building,
the people he's putting to work.

47:48.063 --> 47:49.864
Yeah, but I also heard
he can't be trusted.

47:49.866 --> 47:51.866
I mean,
look at our two witnesses,

47:51.868 --> 47:52.802
they're two of his guys.

47:53.670 --> 47:55.206
This guy's guilty. Drop it.

48:15.592 --> 48:16.760
Yeah,
he's coming in right now.

48:17.027 --> 48:17.994
Absolutely.
I'll let him know, sir.

48:18.761 --> 48:19.562
Bye. Thanks.

48:22.565 --> 48:23.967
You're a lucky man,
Mr. Williams.

48:24.567 --> 48:26.703
Mr. Worthington decided
not to press charges.

48:26.902 --> 48:29.038
Well, considering you have
no evidence, I would assume not.

48:30.005 --> 48:31.141
Don't kid yourself.

48:32.241 --> 48:33.543
Forrest could make things
very difficult for you.

48:33.976 --> 48:34.875
Forrest, huh?

48:34.877 --> 48:36.613
Didn't know you were
on a first-name basis.

48:37.880 --> 48:39.817
Mr. Worthington is a very
influential man in this town.

48:41.284 --> 48:43.853
Do yourself a favor, stay away from Mr.
Worthington and his property.

48:44.688 --> 48:46.090
Next time,
you won't be so lucky.

48:47.656 --> 48:49.626
Is that a warning or threat?

48:51.094 --> 48:52.128
Just a friendly observation.

48:54.197 --> 48:55.666
I'm done. Get him out of here.

49:06.909 --> 49:08.811
No, Sir. He just left.

49:09.378 --> 49:11.346
Oh! This is poppycock.

49:11.348 --> 49:13.650
They haven't a shred of evidence
against him.

49:14.750 --> 49:15.752
No, he won't give you
anymore trouble.

49:17.152 --> 49:18.788
Of course. Anything we can do
to help, Forrest.

49:30.232 --> 49:31.234
Ah! Idiot.

49:35.839 --> 49:38.708
So, you think he's gonna take
your advice and let this one go?

49:39.109 --> 49:39.877
He'd better.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.980
Or he'll find out how not nice
Forrest can be.

49:44.413 --> 49:46.082
Jim, I wouldn't be so sure.

50:17.313 --> 50:18.349
Oh, I bet I could do that.

51:03.826 --> 51:04.660
Clyde...

51:05.395 --> 51:07.328
You realize,
in just a few short days,

51:07.330 --> 51:09.065
this entire block
is gonna be level?

51:11.067 --> 51:14.871
Then we're gonna start construction
of the Worthington Mall.

51:20.509 --> 51:23.312
You know,
I used to play here as a kid.

51:25.982 --> 51:27.016
Good memories.

51:28.150 --> 51:30.154
I don't think my grand-mama's
ever going to forgive me.

51:30.953 --> 51:32.689
What if she won't invite me
to Christmas?

51:33.255 --> 51:34.924
She's still steamed
we threw her out.

51:35.225 --> 51:37.226
We? You're the one
that threw her out.

51:37.493 --> 51:38.661
I still expect my fruitcake.

51:41.264 --> 51:43.967
Oh, come on. A couple of days,
she'll forget all about it.

51:45.134 --> 51:46.469
Just make sure she gets
some extra pudding.

51:49.272 --> 51:51.105
You know,
I'm not so sure about that.

51:51.107 --> 51:53.811
She might be 101, but that woman
has a mind like a steel trap.

52:00.884 --> 52:02.820
- Good morning, Doc.
- Good morning, Cindy.

52:03.052 --> 52:04.388
I can hear the gang in the back.

52:04.888 --> 52:07.156
You know, they always know
the minute you walk in the door.

52:07.489 --> 52:09.956
Uh, how's the food situation?

52:09.958 --> 52:12.096
It's okay. We're good
for another week or so.

52:12.929 --> 52:14.364
Okay, thank you.

52:15.297 --> 52:16.833
What happened with the PI?

52:17.433 --> 52:19.503
Nothing.
My uncle scared him off.

52:20.069 --> 52:21.038
Well, what about the animals?

52:22.038 --> 52:23.139
I'm not giving up hope yet.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.210
Well, something good
will happen. I know it will.

52:28.011 --> 52:30.514
I <i>am standing outside
the home of Connor Williams,</i>

52:30.980 --> 52:33.581
<i>who's been accused
of breaking and entering</i>

52:33.583 --> 52:36.016
<i>Forrest Worthington home,
late last night.</i>

52:36.018 --> 52:37.520
<i>while Mr. Worthington was away.</i>

52:38.221 --> 52:39.987
<i>A source revealed,</i>

52:39.989 --> 52:41.822
<i>Connor Williams threatened
Mr. Worthington yesterday...</i>

52:41.824 --> 52:42.757
That's ridiculous.

52:42.759 --> 52:45.094
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, that's the PI.

52:45.862 --> 52:47.360
He would never break
into my uncle's house

52:47.362 --> 52:48.331
and steal anything.

52:49.531 --> 52:50.900
At least,
I don't think he would.

52:51.835 --> 52:53.103
You forgot to mention
he was cute.

52:54.904 --> 52:56.206
Really? I hadn't noticed.

52:56.605 --> 52:57.971
Yeah, right.

52:57.973 --> 52:59.473
<i>In other news,</i>

52:59.475 --> 53:02.478
<i>the new Smalltown Mall
has hit yet another setback.</i>

53:03.112 --> 53:06.079
<i>Sources close to the project
reveal that the builders</i>

53:06.081 --> 53:08.317
<i>have been forced
to shut down construction</i>

53:08.585 --> 53:11.219
<i>due to a lack
of commercially-zoned land</i>

53:11.221 --> 53:13.157
<i>to build the needed
parking structure.</i>

53:13.889 --> 53:16.290
<i>And to you, Bill,
for more breaking news.</i>

53:16.292 --> 53:17.261
Did you hear that?

53:18.427 --> 53:19.563
They don't have enough land
to build the parking lot.

53:20.429 --> 53:21.931
This is great,
we won't have to move.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.168
Can you cover me?
There's something I gotta do.

53:24.634 --> 53:25.936
Is everything okay, Doc?

53:26.235 --> 53:27.534
Uh, hopefully.

53:27.536 --> 53:28.936
Do you want me to cancel
your appointments?

53:28.938 --> 53:29.540
Please. Thank you.

53:39.281 --> 53:41.949
Great. If we're going to his
house, I hope he's not home.

53:41.951 --> 53:43.887
He is, like, such a bore.

53:46.355 --> 53:48.491
Ow, always mess up on that one.

53:53.263 --> 53:54.297
Dang!

54:02.471 --> 54:03.506
Hey.

54:04.540 --> 54:06.576
Hm, I wonder
what she's gonna say.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.613
Or maybe her coming here
is a good sign.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.882
- What's up?
- I saw the news about your dad.

54:13.382 --> 54:14.016
What are you gonna do?

54:15.317 --> 54:16.986
I don't know. I feel bad enough.

54:18.388 --> 54:19.523
I'm here to help you.

54:21.056 --> 54:22.359
Come up with another plan.

54:23.025 --> 54:24.594
We need to get that will
and clear your dad.

54:25.161 --> 54:27.030
Wait. You wanna help me?

54:27.529 --> 54:30.364
Yeah. That's what friends do,
Peter. They help each other.

54:30.366 --> 54:32.933
I like the way this girl thinks.

54:32.935 --> 54:34.937
Not what I was expecting her
to say.

54:35.203 --> 54:37.173
Really? Back to the scene
of the crime?

54:37.706 --> 54:39.375
Do you think that mutt
will still be there?

54:40.275 --> 54:42.478
You mean Roscoe?
What do you have against him?

54:42.978 --> 54:45.915
He's, like, so uncouth.
No manners.

54:46.482 --> 54:48.585
Do I detect a note of interest?

54:49.152 --> 54:53.657
As if. My only interest
is to not see him again.

54:55.558 --> 54:57.494
Madison.
Thanks for believing in me.

55:02.665 --> 55:03.933
Let's think up a new plan.

55:04.266 --> 55:05.902
I agree. Let's do this.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.349
So, how was today?

55:20.049 --> 55:22.518
Okay. Madison came
and saw Peter.

55:22.719 --> 55:24.655
She told him she wants
to try again and get the will.

55:25.554 --> 55:26.556
You guys on board?

55:28.123 --> 55:30.757
Well, I guess I could
probably tag along,

55:30.759 --> 55:33.129
in case you guys need backup.

55:33.362 --> 55:36.032
Who are you kidding,
you just want to see Roscoe.

55:36.465 --> 55:39.366
Oh, what have I missed?

55:39.368 --> 55:43.105
Nothing. Jackson's just being
his normal, obnoxious self.

55:43.438 --> 55:46.040
There is absolutely
nothing going on

55:46.042 --> 55:48.275
between me and that mutt.

55:48.277 --> 55:51.214
Hmm, me thinks the lady
doth protest too much.

55:52.014 --> 55:53.146
Say what?

55:53.148 --> 55:56.349
It would seem opposites
do attract.

55:56.351 --> 55:58.485
Oh my God,
you guys are both crazy.

55:58.487 --> 56:01.058
There is nothing going on
between Roscoe and I.

56:02.324 --> 56:04.727
Cleo, I apologize.
Now, please...

56:05.228 --> 56:07.364
We have important things
to discuss.

56:08.498 --> 56:09.599
This better be good.

56:10.232 --> 56:13.669
Well, while you two
were playing today,

56:14.103 --> 56:16.070
I was busy collecting
information

56:16.072 --> 56:17.404
at the police station.

56:17.406 --> 56:19.075
Long story short.

56:19.342 --> 56:21.610
I believe those two coppers
are on the take.

56:22.177 --> 56:23.744
So, no one is to be trusted.

56:23.746 --> 56:25.715
Especially
the one they call "Jim."

56:28.083 --> 56:30.583
I told you, you need
to handle this situation.

56:30.585 --> 56:32.319
<i>There have
been a few setbacks,</i>

56:32.321 --> 56:34.355
<i>some of the people
just won't move.</i>

56:34.357 --> 56:36.460
I already told you,
there's nothing I can do.

56:36.659 --> 56:38.692
<i>Clyde, I cannot
believe what you're doing.</i>

56:38.694 --> 56:41.431
I am tired of listening
to your excuses.

56:41.764 --> 56:43.063
Now, I need those people
out of there,

56:43.065 --> 56:44.431
and I need them out today.

56:44.433 --> 56:45.733
Now, you handle this.

56:45.735 --> 56:48.171
<i>I understand.
I will deal with things.</i>

56:48.471 --> 56:51.806
<i>But I know a lot of these
people, some even voted for me.</i>

56:51.808 --> 56:54.543
Look, Grand-mama,
I work for Mr. Worthington.

56:55.078 --> 56:56.413
If he tells me
I gotta throw you out...

56:57.179 --> 56:58.281
I gotta throw you out.

56:58.681 --> 57:01.150
- <i>Do you not love me?</i>
- Yes, I love you.

57:01.516 --> 57:02.518
This is business.

57:03.219 --> 57:04.621
That is not my problem.

57:05.688 --> 57:08.425
I don't let my personal feelings
interfere with my business decisions.

57:09.257 --> 57:10.791
I would think that would
be clear with the way

57:10.793 --> 57:12.462
I handled my aunt and my niece.

57:13.395 --> 57:15.096
Wasn't personal.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.697
<i>You just wait till
I tell your mother.</i>

57:16.699 --> 57:18.568
Does this mean I'm not gonna get my
five dollars in my birthday card?

57:19.268 --> 57:20.804
<i>I used to change your diapers.</i>

57:22.572 --> 57:24.041
Boy, Grand-mama, that was harsh.

57:24.440 --> 57:25.775
You get this done...

57:26.308 --> 57:28.644
or there will be consequences,
I promise you.

57:29.545 --> 57:31.748
I put you in that office,
I can take you out.

57:33.549 --> 57:35.315
<i>I will not tolerate
your behavior.</i>

57:35.317 --> 57:37.420
<i>You know you will have
the family to report to.</i>

57:37.619 --> 57:39.487
Grand-mama,

57:39.489 --> 57:41.058
did you tell Uncle Bill he's
also gonna have to move as well?

57:43.726 --> 57:44.628
Hello?

57:48.331 --> 57:49.499
Ha! Killed you.

57:50.266 --> 57:51.701
Oh, prestige four.

57:55.737 --> 57:57.107
Uh, yeah, hold on.

58:01.277 --> 58:03.447
Guys, here's some lemonade if you want
some right now. I'll be right back.

58:07.650 --> 58:09.382
Mr. Williams, did you really break
into the Worthington mansion?

58:09.384 --> 58:10.520
What were you looking for?

58:11.554 --> 58:13.356
What's your grudge
against the Worthington family?

58:14.889 --> 58:16.859
- What's your grudge against the Worthington family?
- Go away! Leave us alone.

58:19.529 --> 58:21.797
Peter, whatever you do,
don't answer the door.

58:32.040 --> 58:33.806
I swear to God, if you're
another one of those reporters,

58:33.808 --> 58:35.411
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

58:37.846 --> 58:38.881
Katherine!

58:39.348 --> 58:40.550
Hey, what are you doing here?

58:41.284 --> 58:43.284
I saw on the news
you'd been arrested.

58:43.286 --> 58:44.851
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

58:44.853 --> 58:46.355
Oh, no, I wasn't arrested.

58:47.757 --> 58:48.892
This is all my fault.

58:49.725 --> 58:51.228
I should've never
asked you to help me.

58:54.630 --> 58:56.230
Who's she?

58:56.232 --> 58:57.900
She's the reason why we broke
into the mansion.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.835
- She's pretty.
- Yeah, I guess so.

59:00.268 --> 59:01.670
I think your dad thinks she is.

59:01.971 --> 59:03.306
No, he doesn't.

59:04.473 --> 59:06.409
I just thought perhaps you tried
going in to get the will.

59:07.210 --> 59:09.813
No. Though,
now I wish I would have.

59:10.880 --> 59:12.549
Just who does your uncle
think he is, anyway?

59:13.549 --> 59:14.817
The richest man in town.

59:16.819 --> 59:17.821
Would you like to come in?

59:19.554 --> 59:20.656
Okay.

59:28.397 --> 59:31.565
I just made a fresh pitcher
of lemonade.

59:31.567 --> 59:33.866
- Oh, I love lemonade.
- Me, too.

59:33.868 --> 59:36.369
Would you like to stay
and have a glass with me?

59:36.371 --> 59:39.208
Sounds real nice, but I can't.

59:39.542 --> 59:40.808
Oh.

59:40.810 --> 59:43.779
I mean, I want to, it's just,
there's someone I need to see.

59:44.380 --> 59:44.881
Your uncle.

59:45.882 --> 59:47.784
He needs to know
he can't treat people like that.

59:48.351 --> 59:50.554
Katherine, it's not worth it.

59:50.786 --> 59:52.556
Really, just let it go.

59:52.888 --> 59:54.657
Is Mrs. Williams home?

59:56.891 --> 59:59.495
No, uh... my wife...

01:00:00.529 --> 01:00:01.731
Well, she passed away
about a year ago.

01:00:02.297 --> 01:00:03.730
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:00:03.732 --> 01:00:04.833
It's okay.

01:00:06.802 --> 01:00:09.272
You know what? I think I changed
my mind about that lemonade.

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:12.275
Come on in. Let me
introduce you to the kids.

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:14.875
This is Peter
and his good friend, Madison.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.342
Guys, this
is Katherine Worthington.

01:00:16.344 --> 01:00:17.980
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:22.583
Oh, that over there,
that's Jackson, and Mr. Peabody.

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:25.485
Wow,
she's even prettier up close.

01:00:25.487 --> 01:00:27.924
- Down boy.
- You can pat my head anytime.

01:00:28.556 --> 01:00:29.592
Let me get you that lemonade.

01:00:35.364 --> 01:00:36.499
I'm so sorry.

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:39.002
- I am such a klutz.
- Me, too.

01:00:40.502 --> 01:00:42.571
You know, I...
I can make another pitcher.

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.942
Oh, that's all right.
Another time.

01:00:50.779 --> 01:00:51.647
I should get going.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.250
I'll... I'll walk you out.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:56.319
Nice to meet you guys.

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:01.958
I told you
they liked each other.

01:01:03.025 --> 01:01:03.960
You're nuts.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.563
A woman knows these things.

01:01:06.962 --> 01:01:08.697
I'm not listening to you.

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:11.467
Look, I'm really sorry I
couldn't help you find the will.

01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:14.971
It's all right, you've got
your family to think about.

01:01:16.438 --> 01:01:17.840
So, what are you gonna do
with all the dogs?

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.976
Hopefully find them homes.

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:22.710
You guys don't want another dog,
do you?

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:27.350
You don't think he
understood what you said, do you?

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:28.815
Of course he did.

01:01:28.817 --> 01:01:31.587
Animals are much smarter
than we give them credit for.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:32.889
That's true.

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.025
I should get going.

01:01:40.529 --> 01:01:41.797
You're a good man, Connor.

01:01:42.431 --> 01:01:43.600
That's hard to find
in this town.

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:45.935
I'll see you around?

01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:48.071
Yeah. Definitely.

01:01:49.904 --> 01:01:51.307
Promise me you'll stay away
from your uncle.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.076
I promise.

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:03.652
Oh, hey Dad...

01:02:04.085 --> 01:02:05.753
she seems pretty cool.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.557
Do you ever think
you're gonna see her again?

01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:09.058
I don't think so, son. Why?

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:10.660
No reason. Told you.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.099
Oh, he got me with a frag.

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:00.877
Miss Katherine.

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:04.847
I thought Mr. Worthington said you
can't come around here no more.

01:03:05.147 --> 01:03:06.815
I need to see my uncle.

01:03:07.516 --> 01:03:08.151
Now!

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:12.020
- Well, he's not available.
- I don't care.

01:03:13.721 --> 01:03:15.758
- Get out of my way.
- I'm sorry, I got my orders.

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:20.997
Boss!

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.998
Sorry,
I didn't get that.

01:03:23.732 --> 01:03:24.567
Sorry.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:32.909
Katherine. Darling,
it is wonderful to see you.

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:36.079
My goodness, you even make
medical scrubs look regal.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.014
To what do I owe this honor.

01:03:38.746 --> 01:03:39.782
We need to talk.

01:03:40.215 --> 01:03:41.418
Where are your manners?

01:03:42.384 --> 01:03:43.752
No, "Hello, Uncle?"
No kiss on the cheek?

01:03:44.252 --> 01:03:46.152
My goodness...

01:03:46.154 --> 01:03:48.056
if I didn't know better, I'd think
you'd been raised in a barn.

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:51.093
Uncle Forrest,
how do you live with yourself?

01:03:52.127 --> 01:03:53.462
I saw the sign.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.164
What are you up to?

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.232
Well, I thought that would be
obvious, sweetie,

01:03:58.234 --> 01:03:59.668
as old as this place is.

01:04:00.235 --> 01:04:02.504
There's nothing wrong
with this place.

01:04:02.737 --> 01:04:03.540
Oh...

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.642
Sweet,
precious Katherine...

01:04:06.007 --> 01:04:07.676
you naïve child,
look around you.

01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:09.745
This place is ancient.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.215
The property is worth much more
with the house torn down.

01:04:14.949 --> 01:04:17.152
No. You cannot tear it down.

01:04:18.253 --> 01:04:19.956
Well, it's out of my hands.

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:22.125
The city council
made this decision.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:24.726
So, why don't you be a good girl
and run along.

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:27.663
This estate belongs to me.

01:04:28.563 --> 01:04:30.098
And everyone in this town
knows it.

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:34.838
Oh, Katherine... I understand
you're upset, sweetie.

01:04:35.804 --> 01:04:38.208
I mean, our aunt made promises
she didn't keep.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:42.108
And I'm sorry about that,
but the fact remains,

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.147
she left everything to me.

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:46.115
That is a lie.

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:49.849
I now know what you're up to.

01:04:49.851 --> 01:04:50.953
I know your plan.

01:04:51.319 --> 01:04:53.589
I know why you switched
the will.

01:04:54.022 --> 01:04:55.123
You have no proof of that.

01:04:55.991 --> 01:04:57.627
I will get proof.

01:04:58.627 --> 01:04:59.661
Sorry, Boss.
I'll deal with her.

01:05:00.194 --> 01:05:01.194
Don't touch me.

01:05:01.196 --> 01:05:02.598
It's all right, Morris.

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:05.167
Katherine and I have yet
to finish our discussion.

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.936
No, we haven't.

01:05:07.302 --> 01:05:09.138
Unless you've decided
to tell the truth,

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:12.008
there's nothing left for us
to discuss.

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:13.042
Katherine...

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:15.879
who do you think
will believe you?

01:05:17.779 --> 01:05:19.081
Sweetheart, I own this town.

01:05:20.014 --> 01:05:22.618
And every cop
and every politician in it.

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:25.288
You've got nowhere else to go.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.864
Hey, that's Great Aunt Sally's
will, isn't it?

01:05:37.299 --> 01:05:38.868
The real one.

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.270
I thought you got rid of that.

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:42.804
You worry too much, Clyde.

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.174
You're gonna get us
all arrested.

01:05:46.808 --> 01:05:48.210
I knew it was here.

01:05:49.677 --> 01:05:51.246
"To my Great Niece Katherine...

01:05:52.614 --> 01:05:53.616
I leave my home...

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:55.985
and all its contents

01:05:57.085 --> 01:05:58.788
and all the acreage
surrounding."

01:06:00.255 --> 01:06:02.592
Oh my. It seems you were right.

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.794
She did intend for the house
to go to you.

01:06:06.194 --> 01:06:07.963
It's a pity no one's ever going
to see this.

01:06:09.163 --> 01:06:11.199
You... you make me sick.

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:14.704
All this for what? Money?

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:16.773
How much is enough?

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.342
I'll let you know
when I reach that point.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:22.110
You are never gonna get away
with this.

01:06:23.344 --> 01:06:25.714
Sweetheart, I already have.

01:06:27.815 --> 01:06:28.317
No.

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:31.654
Clyde... I'm done now.

01:06:34.355 --> 01:06:35.721
- Let's go.
- Get off me.

01:06:35.723 --> 01:06:37.225
- Let's go, Miss Katherine.
- Get off me.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:44.067
Get off me.

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.203
I'm not sure about this, Boss.

01:06:47.402 --> 01:06:48.937
What if she starts talking?

01:06:49.971 --> 01:06:50.839
That's all right, Morris.

01:06:51.806 --> 01:06:54.710
Katherine's family.
I'll bring her around.

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:58.679
Besides...
the mall contract's signed.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.983
Demolition starts in three days.

01:07:01.215 --> 01:07:02.384
This place will be gone
in a week.

01:07:06.321 --> 01:07:08.154
Stop it!
Don't... Don't do this.

01:07:08.156 --> 01:07:09.925
I won't tell anyone,
just let me go!

01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:12.228
Ow, ow, ow!

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:13.963
Be good
and nothing will happen to you.

01:07:15.764 --> 01:07:16.899
Fork over the purse.

01:07:27.942 --> 01:07:29.411
Clyde!
Let me out, Clyde!

01:08:21.763 --> 01:08:22.798
Your move.

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.304
We have to come up with a plan.
We have to get that will,

01:08:31.305 --> 01:08:32.475
and we have
to clear my dad's name.

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:35.944
I'm here to help.
What are you thinking?

01:08:36.544 --> 01:08:39.981
Well, my gut tells me Mr.
Worthington still has that will.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.819
But, going back...

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.455
That's pretty stupid, isn't it?

01:08:47.889 --> 01:08:48.725
I mean..

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.296
how do we get back in the mansion
without tripping the alarm?

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.997
Well... we create a diversion.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.769
Then we get our supplies...
and our camouflage clothes.

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:01.470
Camouflage?

01:09:02.504 --> 01:09:03.805
Hey, it's stylish.

01:09:04.404 --> 01:09:05.807
I'll stick with basic black.

01:09:06.174 --> 01:09:08.274
Got it.
Let's get those supplies.

01:09:08.276 --> 01:09:11.077
Time to take Mr. Worthington
out with the trash.

01:09:11.078 --> 01:09:12.380
I couldn't agree more.

01:09:20.254 --> 01:09:21.389
This is gonna
get interesting.

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:24.192
- Look at this.
- There's lots of cool stuff.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:29.429
It seems Peter has
enough gadgets to supply an army.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.465
You're killed.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.234
Oh, cool.

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:37.269
<i>Testing,
testing. One, two, three.</i>

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:38.473
<i>Yeah,
you're fine and clear.</i>

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:40.475
Rope. Smart.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:42.978
All right, let's suit up.

01:09:55.557 --> 01:09:57.890
Peabody, you ready
for an adventure?

01:09:57.892 --> 01:09:59.559
You fly ahead
and scout the mansion.

01:09:59.561 --> 01:10:02.999
Roger that. I just hope Peter
knows what he's doing.

01:10:03.397 --> 01:10:04.566
Let's move out.

01:10:17.411 --> 01:10:19.912
I'm ready to take on
those goons.

01:10:19.914 --> 01:10:22.150
And I really love
the new threads.

01:11:12.366 --> 01:11:13.632
So, how do I look?

01:11:13.634 --> 01:11:15.502
Like an idiot.

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:18.337
If we're going on a mission,
we need to look the part.

01:11:18.339 --> 01:11:20.208
Part of what, I'm not so sure.

01:11:20.508 --> 01:11:22.274
You stay well ahead of me.

01:11:22.276 --> 01:11:24.614
I cannot be seen with you
in that outfit.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.618
Suit yourself.
I think I look pretty hot.

01:11:30.518 --> 01:11:32.118
Hey, guys. What's up?

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.156
Hey, why do you keep jumping out
like that?

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.359
Nice one, tough guy.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.091
Dude, why are you so jumpy?

01:11:39.093 --> 01:11:40.395
You caught me off guard.

01:11:40.594 --> 01:11:43.195
I assume the same way
in a again?

01:11:43.197 --> 01:11:45.431
Hey, Jackson, there's a young
lady in the upstairs bedroom,

01:11:45.433 --> 01:11:47.033
I think she needs help.

01:11:47.035 --> 01:11:48.600
Okay, we'll find her.

01:11:48.602 --> 01:11:49.668
I hope it's the blonde.

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:52.540
So, you did come back,
Beautiful.

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:55.544
Yes I did.
But don't get the wrong idea.

01:11:55.977 --> 01:11:57.646
I don't wanna get fleas today.

01:11:58.312 --> 01:11:59.347
Boy, how you been?

01:12:00.081 --> 01:12:01.381
Let's go in and out quick.

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:02.218
Sounds good to me.

01:12:03.317 --> 01:12:04.152
Come on, boy.

01:12:07.521 --> 01:12:09.457
I do hope
they get what they came for.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.428
I'm a little worried.
Those goons can be dangerous.

01:12:16.263 --> 01:12:17.333
Do you have any fours?

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:19.535
Go fish.

01:12:21.035 --> 01:12:22.137
Are you sure
you don't have any fours?

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:23.438
No.

01:12:24.472 --> 01:12:26.141
I asked you for a four.

01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:29.676
Morris, we play this game
every night.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:32.448
Yeah, I'm still learning,
Clyde, I'm still learning.

01:12:33.447 --> 01:12:36.084
- It's only been two years.
- Morris, Morris.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:44.056
You only ask for cards
you have in your hands.

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:45.660
Look at those two idiots.

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:47.663
They need to be taught a lesson.

01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:49.362
Come on.

01:13:16.657 --> 01:13:20.463
That Cleo, what a slice of pie.

01:13:20.695 --> 01:13:22.498
I do think she likes me.

01:13:24.231 --> 01:13:26.599
I gotta go find
that young lady.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:28.371
I'm heading up the stairs.

01:13:38.713 --> 01:13:39.782
Let's go find the study.

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.493
- Kids.
- Let's get them.

01:13:52.259 --> 01:13:53.628
- Come on, Jackson.
- You get him, I'll get her.

01:13:53.861 --> 01:13:55.431
Run, Jackson. Run.

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:58.067
Gotcha, you sniveling,
little pipsqueak.

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:00.770
No, you don't.

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:04.640
Yeah!

01:14:06.807 --> 01:14:07.743
Come on, Jackson.
Let's go.

01:14:11.745 --> 01:14:13.581
Okay, Cleo. You stay here.

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.818
I'll be back for you, I promise.

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:17.285
Now, stay.

01:14:18.285 --> 01:14:19.355
It's too dangerous.

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:21.724
Madison, where are you going?

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.159
Come on, little girl,

01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:28.597
give up
and nobody will get hurt.

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:33.134
If I weren't so tiny,
I'd take you down.

01:14:36.303 --> 01:14:38.606
Is anyone out there?
Get me out of here.

01:14:39.673 --> 01:14:41.407
I'm locked in here.

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:43.746
Yes, yes, we're here.
Are you okay? Who are you?

01:14:44.411 --> 01:14:46.115
I'm Katherine Worthington.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.651
Oh, hey, Katherine,
it's me, Peter. Connor's son.

01:14:50.218 --> 01:14:51.320
I'm gonna let you out.

01:14:53.221 --> 01:14:55.424
Oh, thank you guys so much.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:57.256
Who locked you in there?

01:14:57.258 --> 01:14:58.293
My uncle.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.330
I didn't ask for your opinion,
just get over here right now.

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:03.264
Something's going on.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.236
Katherine,
what do you think you're doing?

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:10.336
Jackson, you ready, boy?
Go get him. Go get him, boy.

01:15:10.338 --> 01:15:12.308
Watch out,
here I come old man.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.439
Whoa!

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.483
Good job, Jackson.
Good boy.

01:15:21.348 --> 01:15:22.748
Ah, that was easy.

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:31.192
I gotcha now.

01:15:33.294 --> 01:15:34.362
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, kid.

01:15:34.728 --> 01:15:36.298
- Peter, run!
- Whoa.

01:15:37.831 --> 01:15:39.200
I should've seen that coming.

01:15:45.839 --> 01:15:47.142
Oh no, he's getting up.

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:50.846
I didn't sign up for kids
and animals.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:56.785
Oh, shoot.

01:16:00.754 --> 01:16:01.856
Yeah!

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:04.690
- Let's go.
- Come on, boy.

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.530
I don't like this.

01:16:11.532 --> 01:16:13.334
There's a lot of noise
coming from inside the house.

01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:15.236
I need to break this leash,
and help.

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:01.250
Oh!

01:17:11.558 --> 01:17:13.963
I never thought I'd say this,
but... help!

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:18.500
Oh, Cleo.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:26.942
- Got the will.
- All right.

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:28.944
Where's Madison?

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:32.744
Oh, Jackson.
So nice of you to show up.

01:17:32.746 --> 01:17:34.314
I was a little busy.

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.484
We need to find Madison.

01:17:36.817 --> 01:17:38.753
Hey, Madison, come on.
We have to go.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.723
Come on, guys, we gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

01:17:41.322 --> 01:17:42.290
Come on, Jackson.

01:17:43.157 --> 01:17:45.628
Next time,
never underestimate a kid.

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:47.859
Not so fast, little one.

01:17:47.861 --> 01:17:49.330
Katherine, wait!

01:17:54.468 --> 01:17:55.503
Give me the will.

01:17:56.404 --> 01:17:57.438
Let her go.

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.843
We don't want anything
to happen to the little ones.

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:05.014
Ow!

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:09.351
Stop! You're all under arrest.

01:18:10.017 --> 01:18:11.052
What are you talking about?

01:18:11.919 --> 01:18:13.489
You need to arrest my uncle.

01:18:13.754 --> 01:18:15.556
You cut that a little close,
Jim.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:18.326
So, that's the "Jim"
Peabody was talking about.

01:18:19.093 --> 01:18:19.927
Sorry, Boss.

01:18:23.397 --> 01:18:24.565
What are you doing here, Wanda?

01:18:24.898 --> 01:18:25.933
You're under arrest.

01:18:26.133 --> 01:18:27.468
Under arrest for what?

01:18:27.901 --> 01:18:29.003
Bribery, for starters.

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:34.806
And Mr. Worthington,

01:18:34.808 --> 01:18:36.641
we need you to come down
to the station

01:18:36.643 --> 01:18:38.845
to address a number of charges.

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:39.848
This is ridiculous.

01:18:41.415 --> 01:18:42.450
Do you know
who you're dealing with?

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:46.018
Yes. And bribing a police
officer and a councilman

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.787
should put you away
for quite some time.

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:50.359
Call my attorney.
He'll straighten all this out.

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:52.761
I'll have you writing parking
tickets by in the morning.

01:18:55.829 --> 01:18:57.065
Say nothing, Morris.

01:18:57.898 --> 01:18:59.368
"Nothing, Morris."

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:03.772
Jolly good show, kids.
You caught the bad guys.

01:19:04.004 --> 01:19:05.641
This would've worked out fine...

01:19:06.173 --> 01:19:07.475
if it hadn't been
for those darn kids,

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:08.944
and those dogs.

01:19:14.581 --> 01:19:16.082
- Come here, you guys.
- Connor.

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:17.486
Are you okay? What's going on?

01:19:18.018 --> 01:19:20.989
Dad, we solved the case
of the missing will.

01:19:21.688 --> 01:19:22.958
What?

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.494
If it wasn't for these two,
and their animals,

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.463
we never would've gotten
the will back.

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.565
Well, aren't you turning
into a little PI.

01:19:30.464 --> 01:19:33.198
Roscoe, how did you get free?

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.935
I broke the leash. I wanted
to make sure you were safe.

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.068
Will I see you again?

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.072
I hope so.

01:19:38.639 --> 01:19:39.975
All right, you know what?

01:19:41.375 --> 01:19:42.444
You guys are gonna have to explain
to me what happened on the way home.

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:43.442
Come on, let's go.

01:19:43.444 --> 01:19:44.480
Come on, boy.

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:46.778
Hey guess what?
You're coming home with us.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.618
Awesome! I guess I will see
my girl again.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.685
Damn.

01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:12.471
Boy, I feel good.

01:20:12.473 --> 01:20:14.806
Nothing like a bath,
instead of just rain water.

01:20:14.808 --> 01:20:17.579
Roscoe, my friend,
you do clean up well.

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:19.748
What do you think, Cleo?

01:20:20.514 --> 01:20:22.584
Sure, I guess
you could say that.

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:24.783
Thanks, guys.

01:20:24.785 --> 01:20:26.422
Yeah, let's go.
Hey there.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.923
Look at the stud on the porch.

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.556
Bow wow!

01:20:31.558 --> 01:20:34.659
Back off! That dog is mine.

01:20:34.661 --> 01:20:37.095
I knew it, she does like me.

01:20:37.097 --> 01:20:38.698
We've got two more new guests
for you, Doc.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.803
Aw, welcome to your new home.

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.040
I want to thank you all again.

01:20:46.607 --> 01:20:49.043
Without your help, none of this
would have been possible.

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:52.548
We now have our own
veterinary hospital and rescue.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.222
I'm so happy your name's
been cleared.

01:21:06.093 --> 01:21:08.864
Bow wow wow, yippee-oh-aye-ay.

01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:10.833
And we all want
to give you this,

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:13.135
since you did solve the case
of the missing will.

01:21:15.602 --> 01:21:18.172
Since we solved the case
of the missing will.

01:21:21.174 --> 01:21:23.645
Thanks so much. Okay, Jackson.

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.077
Dad, check it out.

01:21:27.581 --> 01:21:28.749
That's incredible.

01:21:29.883 --> 01:21:30.484
Just in case you wanted to start
your own junior agency.

01:21:31.151 --> 01:21:32.784
I thought you might need that.

01:21:32.786 --> 01:21:35.220
I think that would be
an excellent idea.

01:21:35.222 --> 01:21:37.989
Not bad... for a human.

01:21:37.991 --> 01:21:40.596
Congratulations, Peter.
You deserve it.

01:21:41.295 --> 01:21:43.965
Nice going, Peter.
I knew you could do it.

01:21:52.606 --> 01:21:53.241
Check it out.

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:55.677
Isn't it cool?

01:21:58.279 --> 01:21:59.114
Hey, Jackson, do you like it?

01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:03.683
He's like,

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:04.620
That's amazing.

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.185
Well...

01:22:07.187 --> 01:22:09.657
I have to say this was quite
an adventure.

01:22:10.124 --> 01:22:11.093
Will there be another one?

01:22:12.026 --> 01:22:13.761
I guess you'll all have to wait
and see.

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:18.000
Want to go
to the skate park, Jackson?

01:22:18.231 --> 01:22:19.931
Come on, let's go.

01:22:33.779 --> 01:22:38.779
