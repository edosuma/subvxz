Try this!

16:31.880 --> 16:33.960
What are you doing?
Time to go.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.210
We'll go together.
You fly!

16:41.210 --> 16:42.670
Of course.

16:42.670 --> 16:43.670
Now, come on!

16:57.750 --> 16:58.790
Got a problem here!

16:58.790 --> 17:02.330
It's not so bad.
You're doing fine.

17:02.330 --> 17:03.750
That is not fine!

17:03.750 --> 17:06.120
Just keep us in the air
as long as you can.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.500
What choice do I have?

17:07.500 --> 17:08.790
That's the spirit!

17:08.790 --> 17:10.380
Can you make it
to the fuel depot?

17:10.380 --> 17:13.000
I'll try, but we're
losing altitude fast.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.620
Governor Pryce, the rebels
are headed for the fuel depot.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.120
I'll mobilize walkers.
We'll trap them there.

17:33.670 --> 17:35.210
This is gonna be close!

17:35.210 --> 17:36.420
It always is!

17:50.750 --> 17:52.580
That was one
of your better crashes.

17:52.580 --> 17:55.710
Kanan Jarrus,
you know I never crash.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.670
I have very...
Very exciting landings.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.710
Thanks for reminding me.
Come on.

KANAN:
Spectre-5, do you read?

18:10.580 --> 18:12.080
How are you coming
with that ship?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.500
Kanan! Did you get her?

18:14.500 --> 18:15.830
HERA: Of course he did.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.460
Yes!

18:20.580 --> 18:23.080
Yes... Isn't flying great?

18:23.920 --> 18:26.250
KANAN: There's been
a change of plans.
We need a pickup...

18:26.250 --> 18:28.330
In the fuel depot, I know.

18:28.330 --> 18:30.170
The Empire does too.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.710
Well, let's hope
you get to us first.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.790
We'll be on top
of the central fuel pod.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.080
Spectre-6, you're gonna
want to hang on.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.830
Sorry, guys,
this is where you get off.

HERA: No.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.920
It's me. All me.

20:22.330 --> 20:23.790
Hey, enough of that.

But, sir, the fuel...

20:41.040 --> 20:43.170
I gave you a direct order.
