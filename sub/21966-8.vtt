00:01.458 --> 00:03.792
I appreciate the gift, Chase,

00:01.458 --> 00:03.792
but next time,

00:03.834 --> 00:06.208
maybe you can make

00:03.834 --> 00:06.208
the chess set human sized.

00:06.250 --> 00:10.333
It's supposed to be a mental

00:06.250 --> 00:10.333
game, not a, unh, physical one.

00:10.375 --> 00:13.041
Check.

00:10.375 --> 00:13.041
My apologies, Chief.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.583
I often forget

00:13.083 --> 00:14.583
our physical disparity.

00:14.625 --> 00:17.625
And, uh, ooh,

00:14.625 --> 00:17.625
checkmate.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.250
Hm.

00:22.417 --> 00:25.542
Hey, son.

00:22.417 --> 00:25.542
Next game's yours.

00:25.583 --> 00:28.709
I can't do anything with this

00:25.583 --> 00:28.709
cavity hurting like this.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.709
Aah! And my dentist

00:28.750 --> 00:31.709
can't see me till tomorrow.

00:31.750 --> 00:35.709
What's wrong, tough guy?

00:31.750 --> 00:35.709
Can't take a little pain?

00:35.750 --> 00:38.458
I can take anything

00:35.750 --> 00:38.458
except you.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.500
Aah! Code!

00:38.500 --> 00:41.500
Watch where you're going!

00:41.542 --> 00:44.542
What's wrong with Kade?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.542
Don't mind him, Cody.

00:44.583 --> 00:47.083
Looks like you have

00:44.583 --> 00:47.083
your own set of worries.

00:47.125 --> 00:49.166
I've been trying to get Boulder

00:47.125 --> 00:49.166
to help me build a skate ramp,

00:49.208 --> 00:52.834
but he's too busy.

00:49.208 --> 00:52.834
Doing what?

00:52.875 --> 00:57.792
BOULDER:

00:52.875 --> 00:57.792
Step, hop, shuffle back.

00:52.875 --> 00:57.792
Step, hop, shuffle back--

00:57.834 --> 00:59.875
Boulder, Boulder!

00:59.917 --> 01:03.083
Hey, Chief. I've always wanted

00:59.917 --> 01:03.083
to learn tap dancing.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.333
It's fun

01:03.125 --> 01:05.333
and a great workout.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.291
I'm all for exercise,

01:05.375 --> 01:07.291
Boulder,

01:07.333 --> 01:09.750
but I'm not sure

01:07.333 --> 01:09.750
the garage floor can handle it.

01:09.792 --> 01:13.417
Ugh, you're right.

01:09.792 --> 01:13.417
I'm not very good anyway.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.458
Well, I didn't say that,

01:13.458 --> 01:15.458
Boulder, I--

01:17.500 --> 01:21.792
Sorry, Blades. I'm just

01:17.500 --> 01:21.792
too tired to wax you right now.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.417
( yawns )

01:23.458 --> 01:24.667
That's what

01:23.458 --> 01:24.667
you said yesterday.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.625
You're always too tired.

01:26.667 --> 01:29.709
I have needs too,

01:26.667 --> 01:29.709
you know.

01:32.291 --> 01:34.542
Everyone appears to be having

01:32.291 --> 01:34.542
difficulty getting along today.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.542
Maybe they all just need to walk

01:34.583 --> 01:37.542
a mile in each other's shoes.

01:37.583 --> 01:40.250
Not wearing or even

01:37.583 --> 01:40.250
possessing shoes of my own,

01:40.291 --> 01:42.750
I fail to see the purpose in

01:40.291 --> 01:42.750
lending them to someone else.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.959
It's just an old saying, Chase.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.959
It means you never know

01:46.000 --> 01:47.709
what another person's

01:46.000 --> 01:47.709
going through

01:47.750 --> 01:49.959
until you see things

01:47.750 --> 01:49.959
from their point of view.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.709
I still do not see how either

01:50.000 --> 01:53.709
footwear or hiking play a role.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.750
( machine beeping )

01:55.792 --> 01:57.542
Hey, Frankie,

01:55.792 --> 01:57.542

01:57.583 --> 01:59.375
Cody, you have to come

01:59.417 --> 02:01.458
It's my Dad.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.458
He's...

02:01.500 --> 02:04.333
He's kind of, uh...

Use your tail rotor!

Oh, you don't have one, do you?

03:12.625 --> 03:15.000
Never mind.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.000
Enough fooling around.

03:15.041 --> 03:17.542
Power up and energize.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.000

03:27.041 --> 03:29.709
Now I know

03:27.041 --> 03:29.709
how a Flobster feels.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.583
What was that all about,

03:29.750 --> 03:31.583
Doc?

03:31.625 --> 03:33.417
It concerns a new invention,

03:33.458 --> 03:35.792
so delicate

03:33.458 --> 03:35.792
it requires zero gravity

03:35.834 --> 03:37.500
for its final assembly.

03:37.542 --> 03:39.875
Like those experiments

03:37.542 --> 03:39.875

the experience

03:43.291 --> 03:45.375
with the anti-gravity patch,

03:45.417 --> 03:47.667
but it looks like I'll have to

03:45.417 --> 03:47.667
finish assembling this device

03:47.709 --> 03:50.750

03:47.709 --> 03:50.750

03:50.792 --> 03:52.959
Can I come along, Daddy?

You've been promising to take me

03:53.000 --> 03:56.083

In fact,

03:59.041 --> 04:01.917
why don't we all go?

04:01.959 --> 04:04.667
We can pack a picnic and make

04:01.959 --> 04:04.667
a day of it up on the Asgard.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.750
Really?

About time we were invited.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.083
Thanks, Doc.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.083
Great.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.917
Uh, been there.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.917
Got sick.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.542
A picnic?

04:09.959 --> 04:12.542
Wow, thrillsville.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.917
We get to watch humans eat.

It's designed especially

04:47.667 --> 04:49.959
for medical research.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.125
Say, for example,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.125
your tooth hurts...

04:52.166 --> 04:54.000
My tooth does hurt.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.417
You connect to one end,

04:54.041 --> 04:56.417
your doctor to the other,

04:56.458 --> 04:59.834
and the BDL lets her feel

04:56.458 --> 04:59.834
exactly what you're feeling.

Thereby enabling caregivers

07:27.333 --> 07:29.208
Doc, get in here!

07:27.333 --> 07:29.208
Aah!

07:29.250 --> 07:32.625
GRAHAM:

07:29.250 --> 07:32.625
One. Commencing re-entry.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

07:57.542 --> 07:59.208
Everybody okay?

07:59.250 --> 08:01.834
Hey, my mouth stopped hurting.

08:01.875 --> 08:05.125
Now, my mouth hurts,

08:01.875 --> 08:05.125
and I don't even have teeth.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.083
Wait a minute,

08:05.166 --> 08:07.083
who said that?

08:07.125 --> 08:10.834
I must have fallen asleep

08:07.125 --> 08:10.834
inside Blades.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.291
What did I miss?

08:10.875 --> 08:13.291
CHIEF: By Fourier's Law!

08:13.333 --> 08:16.625
This is incredible.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.583
It appears somehow--

08:16.667 --> 08:19.583
We've all switched places.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.667
Just like that movie I saw.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.166
Somebody must have

08:21.709 --> 08:24.166
a magic coin.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.291
But, Daddy,

08:24.208 --> 08:26.291
how did it happen?

08:26.333 --> 08:28.625
Don't ask me, ask Doc.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.667
The nebula particles.

08:30.709 --> 08:34.291
Of course, they must have

08:30.709 --> 08:34.291
affected the crystal of my BDL.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.083
What do you mean,

08:34.333 --> 08:36.083
my BDL?

08:36.125 --> 08:38.750
I mean, your BDL.

08:36.125 --> 08:38.750
I mean--

08:38.792 --> 08:41.750
There are no rules for dealing

08:38.792 --> 08:41.750
with a situation like this.

08:41.792 --> 08:45.166
It is fraught with potential.

08:41.792 --> 08:45.166
Both disturbing and comic.

08:45.208 --> 08:47.166
Noble.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.333
How many creatures

08:47.208 --> 08:48.333
in the galaxy?

08:48.375 --> 08:51.792
( all talking at once )

08:51.834 --> 08:55.166
I think I made the right choice

08:51.834 --> 08:55.166
staying down here.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.000
( all talking at once )

08:59.041 --> 09:03.667
Hey guys, guys.

08:59.041 --> 09:03.667
Everybody? Stop!

09:03.709 --> 09:07.875
Um, who exactly is where?

09:03.709 --> 09:07.875
Dad?

09:07.917 --> 09:09.208
I'm here, Son.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.166
Um, so that means Doc is--

09:12.208 --> 09:16.250
Chief, I don't know how you

09:12.208 --> 09:16.250
put up with this itchy mustache.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.875
Cody, where are you?

09:16.291 --> 09:18.875
I'm here, Chase.

09:18.917 --> 09:22.041
I'm not Chase, I'm Francine.

09:18.917 --> 09:22.041
I am Chase, Boulder.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.250
And may I say how unusual

09:22.083 --> 09:25.250
it is to be wearing a skirt.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.125
Or any clothes,

09:25.291 --> 09:27.125
for that matter.

09:27.166 --> 09:31.625
Okay, Chase, Boulder,

09:27.166 --> 09:31.625
Frankie, Cody and...?

09:31.667 --> 09:34.750
Heatwave. We gotta do

09:31.667 --> 09:34.750
something about this tooth.

09:34.792 --> 09:38.375
Ugh.

09:34.792 --> 09:38.375
Oh, sure, now who's a whiner?

09:38.417 --> 09:40.625
...and Kade.

09:38.417 --> 09:40.625
That leaves...

09:40.667 --> 09:43.166
You don't recognize

09:40.667 --> 09:43.166
your own sister?

09:43.208 --> 09:46.083
I have never been this close

09:43.208 --> 09:46.083
to the ground before.

09:46.125 --> 09:50.125
I feel so safe.

09:46.125 --> 09:50.125
Dani and Blades. Got it.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.709
Now that you have that

09:50.166 --> 09:52.709
straightened out, what do we do?

09:52.750 --> 09:56.083
I have no idea.

09:52.750 --> 09:56.083
But I've got a great diagram.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.125
Is this temporary, Doc?

09:58.166 --> 10:02.083
Hard to say, I'll go back

09:58.166 --> 10:02.083
to the lab to do some research.

10:02.125 --> 10:05.375
Once I know exactly what caused

10:02.125 --> 10:05.375
this switcheroo effect,

10:05.417 --> 10:09.041
I'll know how to reverse it.

10:05.417 --> 10:09.041
Hopefully.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.291
Hopefully?

10:10.333 --> 10:12.208
Want me to come along,

10:10.333 --> 10:12.208
Daddy?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.375
No, thank you, Chase.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.375
Why would I--

10:14.417 --> 10:18.750
Oh, Frankie.

10:14.417 --> 10:18.750
Yes, of course.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
I have to get back

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
to the firehouse.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.834
There's something

10:20.792 --> 10:22.834
I can't wait to try.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.917
Oop, forgot.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.333
Don't have

10:25.959 --> 10:27.333
a vehicle mode, do I?

10:27.375 --> 10:30.250
Cody, could I have a ride?

10:27.375 --> 10:30.250
Sure, Boulder.

10:30.291 --> 10:33.166
But I'm not sure how to, uh--

10:30.291 --> 10:33.166
Just kind of think to yourself,

10:33.208 --> 10:34.750
"Bulldozer," and...

10:37.208 --> 10:40.041
This is incredible!

10:40.083 --> 10:42.333
I have to try this.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.959
( screaming )

10:47.041 --> 10:51.959
See, Dani?

10:47.041 --> 10:51.959
Flying's not so easy, is it?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.834
Step, hop, shuffle back.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.834
Fa-lap, ball, change.

10:55.875 --> 11:00.917
Step, hop, shuffle back.

10:55.875 --> 11:00.917
Fa-lap, ball, change. Yes!

11:00.959 --> 11:03.166
(  light dramatic theme

11:00.959 --> 11:03.166
playing  )

11:03.208 --> 11:06.041
That's more like it.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.375
Oh, yeah.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.375
Totally get you now, Heatwave.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.875
Ha, ha. Hey, if I were this

11:11.417 --> 11:14.875
powerful, I'd be arrogant too.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.709
Whoo-hoo!

11:18.750 --> 11:21.166
Be careful, Kade.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.166
Don't ding me up.

11:21.208 --> 11:27.166
Ugh. How can one little part

11:21.208 --> 11:27.166
of one puny body hurt so much?

11:27.208 --> 11:29.542
You could go to the dentist

11:27.208 --> 11:29.542
for me.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.250
I mean, you know,

11:29.583 --> 11:31.250
for you.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.250
Would it stop the pain?

11:31.291 --> 11:34.250
Sure.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.375
Sort of.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.458
What's a dentist?

11:41.250 --> 11:44.208
Ugh. At least I'm not

11:41.250 --> 11:44.208
completely out of uniform.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.750
( hammer banging )

11:46.792 --> 11:49.375
Boulder.

11:46.792 --> 11:49.375
That is, uh, Cody.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.792
Might I assist you

11:50.834 --> 11:53.041
in constructing this,

11:50.834 --> 11:53.041
whatever it is?

11:53.083 --> 11:54.333
I got it, Chase,

11:54.375 --> 11:55.875
now that I'm big enough

11:54.375 --> 11:55.875
to build stuff.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.542
But I'm still having a little

11:58.250 --> 12:01.542
trouble getting used to it.

12:01.583 --> 12:04.125
And I find it strange

12:01.583 --> 12:04.125
to be this small.

12:04.166 --> 12:07.375
Humans seem very fragile.

12:04.166 --> 12:07.375
More than I ever imagined.

12:07.417 --> 12:10.333
I must apologize to Chief

12:07.417 --> 12:10.333
for that chess set.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.792
Blades!

12:10.375 --> 12:13.792
Get out of my room!

12:13.834 --> 12:16.875
( gulps ):

12:13.834 --> 12:16.875
This is amazing.

12:16.917 --> 12:20.083
It's cold, but it's smooth

12:16.917 --> 12:20.083
on my tongue. Ooh!

12:20.125 --> 12:21.417
Can I try potato chips?

12:21.458 --> 12:23.041
I'll mix them

12:21.458 --> 12:23.041
in with the yogurt.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.041
You're gonna

12:23.083 --> 12:25.041
make me sick.

12:25.083 --> 12:29.500
I've always wanted

12:25.083 --> 12:29.500
to see where you live.

12:29.542 --> 12:32.250
How do you learn

12:29.542 --> 12:32.250
all this?

12:32.291 --> 12:34.375
That's why I never sleep.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.375
Now come on.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.250
There are a lot of chores

12:34.417 --> 12:36.250
you're gonna have to do for me.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.250
Grocery shopping!

12:38.291 --> 12:40.250
Ah, I've always wanted

12:38.291 --> 12:40.250
to push the cart.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.917
Get out of my room

12:40.291 --> 12:43.917
and get out of my dress!

12:47.250 --> 12:48.250
How's it going, Doc?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.125
Ooh! Whoa!

12:50.083 --> 12:52.125
I'm sorry.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.917
I just can't get used

12:52.166 --> 12:54.917
to seeing me.

12:54.959 --> 12:57.166
Daddy says this effect

12:54.959 --> 12:57.166
won't wear off any time soon.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.542
We're running tests

12:57.208 --> 12:58.542
on the nebula particles

12:58.583 --> 13:00.542
to see

12:58.583 --> 13:00.542
if we can reverse it.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.500
Everything's taking a bit

13:00.583 --> 13:03.500
longer than usual, though.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.375
No offense, old friend,

13:05.417 --> 13:07.417
but you don't have

13:05.417 --> 13:07.417
the precise motor skills

13:07.458 --> 13:09.375
I've developed

13:07.458 --> 13:09.375
over the years.

13:09.417 --> 13:14.250
Go ahead and say it, Doc.

13:09.417 --> 13:14.250
I have stubby fingers. I know.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.291
( cell phone rings )

13:16.333 --> 13:17.458
Hello?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.375
Emergency?

13:19.417 --> 13:21.333
I'm afraid

13:19.417 --> 13:21.333
you have the wrong number.

13:21.375 --> 13:25.542
I mean, it's the right number,

13:21.375 --> 13:25.542
but... It's for you.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.458
Griffin Rock Emergency.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.458
We'll be right there.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.250
Can I borrow your com, Doc?

13:31.291 --> 13:33.458
Attention, team.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.375
There's a brush fire

13:33.500 --> 13:35.375
out near the water tower.

13:35.417 --> 13:37.333
Not huge, but we need

13:35.417 --> 13:37.333
to take care of it

13:37.375 --> 13:39.333
before it gets out of hand.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.291
Remember, no matter

13:39.375 --> 13:41.291
who's where or what's what,

13:41.333 --> 13:43.917
we're still rescuers

13:41.333 --> 13:43.917
first and foremost.

13:43.959 --> 13:47.500
Oh, and Frankie?

13:43.959 --> 13:47.500
We need a ride.

13:47.542 --> 13:50.583
KADE ( as Heatwave ):

13:47.542 --> 13:50.583
Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue.

13:50.625 --> 13:54.250
HEATWAVE ( as Kade ):

13:50.625 --> 13:54.250
That sounds so weird.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.542
( as Dani ):

13:54.291 --> 13:56.542
How can you not love flying,

13:54.291 --> 13:56.542
Blades?

13:56.583 --> 13:59.333
The wind blowing past you,

13:56.583 --> 13:59.333
the freedom.

13:59.375 --> 14:02.208
The moment when you realize

13:59.375 --> 14:02.208
there is absolutely nothing

14:02.250 --> 14:04.917
between you and the ground

14:02.250 --> 14:04.917
but a thousand feet of air.

14:04.959 --> 14:07.417
I'm gonna fly

14:04.959 --> 14:07.417
a little lower, okay?

14:07.458 --> 14:10.875
I will spare you the snarky

14:07.458 --> 14:10.875
comment about irony.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.166
The experience

14:12.625 --> 14:15.166
of riding inside myself

14:15.208 --> 14:17.250
may be more than this

14:15.208 --> 14:17.250
comparatively tiny brain

14:17.291 --> 14:19.250
can handle.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.250
Can you believe it?

14:19.291 --> 14:20.583
I'm a car!

14:20.625 --> 14:22.417
Hey, can I turn on

14:20.625 --> 14:22.417
the siren?

14:22.458 --> 14:25.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:27.208 --> 14:30.208
Ow!

14:27.208 --> 14:30.208
Sorry. Unh!

14:30.250 --> 14:31.417
BLADES ( as Dani ):

14:30.250 --> 14:31.417
The canopy's stuck.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.375
( grunts )

14:36.417 --> 14:39.250
HEATWAVE ( as Kade ):

14:36.417 --> 14:39.250
Nice one.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.250
I'll take care of this.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.417
Come on!

14:43.458 --> 14:46.375
( grunting )

14:46.417 --> 14:52.375
Hard to dig a firebreak

14:46.417 --> 14:52.375
with such, unh, tiny tools.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.208
I'll take care of it,

14:52.417 --> 14:54.208
Boulder.

14:54.250 --> 14:56.208
Cody, it's a lot trickier

14:54.250 --> 14:56.208
than you think.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.709
Just let me drive and-- Aah!

14:57.750 --> 14:59.542
(  upbeat theme playing  )

15:05.333 --> 15:07.125
Whoa!

15:05.333 --> 15:07.125
Cody, stop!

15:10.792 --> 15:13.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:13.291 --> 15:14.667
( grunts )

15:14.709 --> 15:16.291
BLADES ( as Dani ):

15:14.709 --> 15:16.291
Got it. Whoa!

15:16.333 --> 15:17.583
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:22.333 --> 15:25.083
( all screaming )

15:29.083 --> 15:31.667
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:36.083 --> 15:37.542
Hey! That's my job.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.417
( grunts )

15:47.667 --> 15:51.083
Ugh. Okay, everybody, gather

15:47.667 --> 15:51.083
your things and get to safety.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.417
Thank goodness.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.417
Oh, wow.

15:56.041 --> 15:57.625
My apologies.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.166
Francine decided

15:57.667 --> 16:00.166
to take the long way.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.458
The very long way.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.375
I was up to 35 miles

16:02.500 --> 16:05.375
per hour!

16:05.417 --> 16:09.417
( sighs ):

16:05.417 --> 16:09.417
We need to end this before

16:05.417 --> 16:09.417
there are any big emergencies.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.083
( panting )

16:12.125 --> 16:13.458
Can I quit yet?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.792
After all that frozen yogurt?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.792
No way.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.792
Staying in shape

16:15.834 --> 16:17.792
is part of the job.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.500
( groans )

16:19.542 --> 16:21.250
CODY ( as Boulder ):

16:19.542 --> 16:21.250
Looking good.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.333
Sorry, I didn't help you

16:21.291 --> 16:23.333
with it earlier, Cody.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.333
Your tap dancing was just

16:23.375 --> 16:25.333
as important to you

16:25.375 --> 16:27.375
as my skate ramp

16:25.375 --> 16:27.375
was to me.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.500
But now that

16:27.417 --> 16:29.500
I've finished it,

16:29.542 --> 16:31.333
I'm too big to put on skates

16:29.542 --> 16:31.333
to enjoy it.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.250
I'm not sure

16:31.375 --> 16:33.250
you'd want to.

16:33.291 --> 16:36.834
These human Cody-feet ache

16:33.291 --> 16:36.834
from all that tap dancing I did.

16:36.875 --> 16:38.667
I'll be happy

16:36.875 --> 16:38.667
to trade you back.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.333
No offense, Boulder,

16:40.375 --> 16:42.375
but I don't know

16:40.375 --> 16:42.375
how you get around on these.

16:42.417 --> 16:44.208
(  light dramatic theme

16:42.417 --> 16:44.208
playing  )

16:46.375 --> 16:51.333
Maybe it is time you found

16:46.375 --> 16:51.333
a new dentist, Kade Burns.

16:55.375 --> 16:57.375
What did you do

16:55.375 --> 16:57.375
to Dr. Bieber?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.834
He put his hand in my mouth.

16:59.875 --> 17:02.166
Gotta admit,

16:59.875 --> 17:02.166
it does feel better.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.250
( sighs )

17:03.291 --> 17:04.792
Good news, team.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.709
Doc says he may have

17:04.834 --> 17:06.709
found an answer.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.458
He wants us to meet back

17:06.750 --> 17:08.458
at the Space Center.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.709
See you all there.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.375
CHIEF ( as Doc ):

17:10.750 --> 17:13.375
The switcheroo effect

17:10.750 --> 17:13.375
can be reversed.

17:13.417 --> 17:15.667
But we'll have to go

17:13.417 --> 17:15.667
back up in space

17:15.709 --> 17:17.792
to recreate the situation

17:15.709 --> 17:17.792
within the nebula.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.500
And soon.

17:19.542 --> 17:20.875
There's only

17:19.542 --> 17:20.875
a small window of time

17:20.917 --> 17:23.208
before the cloud moves

17:20.917 --> 17:23.208
further off into space.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.834
I will be so happy not

17:23.250 --> 17:26.834
to have to exercise anymore.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.417
I don't know how you do it all,

17:26.875 --> 17:29.417
Dani. I am exhausted.

17:29.458 --> 17:30.834
And my tummy hurts.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.625
Oh, great.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.208
But I promise, Blades,

17:32.667 --> 17:35.208
as soon as this is over,

17:35.250 --> 17:36.792
you're getting waxing.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.291
And I'll never give you trouble

17:36.834 --> 17:39.291
about flying again.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.834
Well, maybe till Tuesday.

17:41.875 --> 17:46.125
Where'd Dad go?

17:41.875 --> 17:46.125
I--I mean, Doc?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.417
( dance music playing )

17:48.458 --> 17:51.458
( Doc Greene

17:48.458 --> 17:51.458
scatting to music )

17:51.500 --> 17:55.250
CHIEF ( as Doc ):

17:51.500 --> 17:55.250
Um, Chief?

17:55.291 --> 17:57.125
Oh.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.125
( music stops )

17:57.166 --> 17:59.583
You caught me.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.583
Ever since we were kids

17:59.625 --> 18:02.208
I wished I could bust a move

17:59.625 --> 18:02.208
like you, Doc.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.250
Figured

18:02.250 --> 18:04.250
this was my last chance.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.875
( water tower rumbling )

18:05.917 --> 18:09.583
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:09.625 --> 18:11.834
The water tower!

18:09.625 --> 18:11.834
( Graham sighs )

18:11.875 --> 18:14.500
It must have sustained damage

18:11.875 --> 18:14.500
during the rescue.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.458
I should have inspected it

18:14.542 --> 18:16.458
before we left.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.333
Not your fault, Graham.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.166
The important thing

18:18.375 --> 18:20.166
is what we do now.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.500
We need to get those hikers

18:20.208 --> 18:22.500
out of the way.

18:22.542 --> 18:24.667
If that thing falls,

18:22.542 --> 18:24.667
it'll land right on top of them.

18:24.709 --> 18:27.375
The Asgard

18:24.709 --> 18:27.375
is right in its path!

18:27.417 --> 18:30.208
If the launch pad is flooded

18:27.417 --> 18:30.208
or the Asgard damaged,

18:30.250 --> 18:31.875
the flight

18:30.250 --> 18:31.875
will have to be scrubbed.

18:31.917 --> 18:35.208
Then we'll miss the nebula

18:31.917 --> 18:35.208
and stay this way...

18:35.250 --> 18:38.542
Forever?

18:35.250 --> 18:38.542
No! We can stop it, everybody.

18:38.583 --> 18:41.500
You've all seen your partners

18:38.583 --> 18:41.500
do their jobs a hundred times.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.208
It's just a matter

18:41.542 --> 18:43.208
of concentrating

18:43.250 --> 18:44.542
and helping each other.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.834
Come on, Chase,

18:44.583 --> 18:47.834
let's warn those hikers.

18:47.875 --> 18:51.291
Dani, transform

18:47.875 --> 18:51.291
and get me up there.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.667
Sure you know

18:51.333 --> 18:52.667
what you're doing?

18:52.709 --> 18:55.500
No duh! But you better

18:52.709 --> 18:55.500
come along anyway.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.166
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:07.250 --> 19:10.583
Humans, take cover

19:07.250 --> 19:10.583
with all possible haste!

19:20.291 --> 19:21.709
FRANKIE ( as Chase ):

19:20.291 --> 19:21.709
Careful, Francine!

19:21.750 --> 19:23.375
You've done this a lot

19:21.750 --> 19:23.375
for me, Chase.

19:23.417 --> 19:24.500
About time I pay you back.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.500
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:32.458 --> 19:34.500
Whoa!

19:34.542 --> 19:35.542
Nicely done, Francine.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.834
KADE ( as Heatwave ):

19:37.709 --> 19:39.834
Okay, just like I told you.

19:39.875 --> 19:42.875
HEATWAVE ( as Kade ):

19:39.875 --> 19:42.875
Power Up and energize!

19:42.917 --> 19:45.208
Huh. I've always wanted

19:42.917 --> 19:45.208
to say that.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.542
( grunts )

19:46.583 --> 19:48.875
CHASE ( as Frankie ):

19:46.583 --> 19:48.875
Thanks, Heatwave.

19:48.917 --> 19:52.375
CODY ( as Boulder ):

19:48.917 --> 19:52.375
Steady. That's it.

19:48.917 --> 19:52.375
You're doing great.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.333
DOC GREENE ( as Chief ) :

20:02.417 --> 20:04.333
Nice work, team.

20:04.375 --> 20:08.333
But we have to hurry.

20:04.375 --> 20:08.333
We only have a few more minutes.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.417
Three, two, one...

20:11.458 --> 20:13.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:18.000 --> 20:20.291
Sure you want me

20:18.000 --> 20:20.291
to do this, Doc?

20:20.333 --> 20:21.959
You'll be

20:20.333 --> 20:21.959
much better at it.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.542
That is, I will.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.542
Don't worry, Chief.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.250
I'll guide you

20:24.583 --> 20:26.250
through the process.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.792
Glad you have faith

20:28.709 --> 20:30.792
in me, Doc.

20:30.834 --> 20:32.500
Use the tweezers

20:30.834 --> 20:32.500
to lift the crystal.

20:34.417 --> 20:35.750
You only have

20:34.417 --> 20:35.750
a few more seconds.

20:39.375 --> 20:42.375
( rumbling )

20:39.375 --> 20:42.375
GRAHAM:  The nebula is drifting!

20:42.417 --> 20:44.583
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

20:44.625 --> 20:45.625
( electricity crackling )

20:52.625 --> 20:55.500
-Did it work, Daddy?

20:52.625 --> 20:55.500
-I believe, Francine,

20:55.542 --> 20:57.500
you have just answered

20:55.542 --> 20:57.500
your own question.

20:57.542 --> 21:01.417
Awesome.

20:57.542 --> 21:01.417
Oh, thank goodness.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.667
And, may I add,

21:01.458 --> 21:03.667
that having worn your shoes,

21:03.709 --> 21:05.709
I found them

21:03.709 --> 21:05.709
quite comfortable.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.333
I can see how being a human

21:05.750 --> 21:08.333
might be enjoyable.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.625
You're right.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.625
It wasn't so bad.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.625
Yeah, it was pretty much

21:09.667 --> 21:12.625
terrible.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.792
Sorry if your feet hurt,

21:12.667 --> 21:14.792
Cody.

21:14.834 --> 21:17.750
No problem. There's a skate ramp

21:14.834 --> 21:17.750
waiting for me at home.

21:17.792 --> 21:20.417
And I built it myself,

21:17.792 --> 21:20.417
with some help.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.792
And no more pain!

21:22.834 --> 21:25.625
You're welcome.

21:22.834 --> 21:25.625
That means I can eat now!

21:25.667 --> 21:27.125
How 'bout we finish

21:25.667 --> 21:27.125
that picnic?

21:27.166 --> 21:31.458
No, thanks. For some reason,

21:27.166 --> 21:31.458
I'm not hungry.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )
