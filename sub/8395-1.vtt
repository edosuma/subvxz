00:22.740 --> 00:25.800
YEAH.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.182
IT'S JUST OVERWHELMING.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.291
IT'S A NORMAL REACTION.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.854
YOUR MOM MUST BE SO EXCITED.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.928
UH...

01:05.230 --> 01:07.437
THIS ISN'T A PREGNANCY
YOU WANT,

01:07.550 --> 01:09.609
YOU NEED TO ACT SOONER
RATHER THAN LATER.

01:12.860 --> 01:14.475
OKAY.

01:14.590 --> 01:16.683
BECAUSE IT'S GETTING CLOSE
TO THE TIME THAT IT'S SAFE

01:16.800 --> 01:18.370

01:21.010 --> 01:22.625
WOW.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.527

02:28.700 --> 02:30.383
I GOT YOU.

02:30.490 --> 02:32.287
WHY, YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
SCANDALOUS

02:32.390 --> 02:34.529
IF YOU AND I WENT TO THE OFFICE
AT THE SAME TIME?

02:34.630 --> 02:36.188
I THINK THEY'RE LAWYERS,
AND THEY'RE SMART,

02:36.290 --> 02:37.598
AND THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.737
I THINK WE SHOULD
LET THEM FIGURE IT OUT.

02:40.850 --> 02:43.159
I SHOULD'VE NEVER LET YOU
GO IN LAW SCHOOL.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.568
MAYBE I LET YOU GO
IN LAW SCHOOL.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.250
MM, NO, THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I REMEMBER IT.

02:46.370 --> 02:47.849

02:47.960 --> 02:50.224
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WE JUST PUT THIS DRESS ON.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.058
WHAT? NO, WE DIDN'T.
YOU PUT THIS DRESS ON.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.683
IT'S MY JOB TO TAKE IT OFF.

02:53.790 --> 02:56.543
[mechanical squealing]
YOU HEAR THAT?

02:56.650 --> 03:01.269
IT'S THE SOUND OF...
SWEET FROTH,

03:01.380 --> 03:02.722
WHICH I JUST LEARNED
HOW TO MAKE.

03:02.830 --> 03:06.652
- YOU KNOW I HATE CAPPUCCINO.
- NO, NO, NOT THE WAY I MAKE IT.

03:06.770 --> 03:11.070
LISTEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK
FOR RUBY'S BED THERE?

03:11.190 --> 03:13.738

YEAH, THE POLKA DOTS ARE NICE.
IT'S GONNA CHANGE YOUR MIND.

- I MEAN, YOU DID GOOD.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.720
IT'S ME.
IT'S ME.

03:35.830 --> 03:37.718
IT'S OKAY; YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LIKE CAPPUCCINO.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.172
- I LOVE IT.
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.588
'CAUSE THIS IS GETTING ME
NERVOUS.

- SHE LOVES YOU.
- RIGHT.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.933
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M LEAVING,

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.744
- YES, I DO. I'M DOING THAT.
- DON'T BRING A LOT OF MONEY TO
VEGAS.

03:56.850 --> 04:01.196
ANYWAY, SHE REALLY LIKED ME
WHEN I WAS YOUR ASSISTANT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW RUBY'S GONNA
FEEL ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

04:01.310 --> 04:02.572
ME AS DAD'S GIRLFRIEND.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.715
I THINK SHE'LL BE EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.

04:07.310 --> 04:08.959
- SHE WILL BE EXCITED?
- YEAH.

04:09.070 --> 04:12.312
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD HER?
YOU TOLD SANDY, RIGHT?

04:12.420 --> 04:14.206
I MEAN, NOT DIRECTLY.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.106
SANDY DOESN'T KNOW?

04:16.220 --> 04:18.734
- NOT YET.
- SANDY'S MOVING BACK TO TOWN
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER,

04:18.840 --> 04:21.047
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THE SITUATION IS?

04:21.150 --> 04:22.458
NO, NOT YET.
I'M GONNA TELL HER.

04:22.570 --> 04:24.322
- OKAY.
- BUT I'M GONNA WAIT
TILL SHE'S--

04:24.430 --> 04:25.943
YEAH, WAIT TILL
IT'S GOOD FOR HER.

04:26.050 --> 04:28.086
SHE'S INTENSE. SHE'S A VERY
INTENSE WOMAN.

YOU CAN'T LET HER DICT ATE
THIS KIND OF STUFF, YOU KNOW.

04:30.710 --> 04:32.405
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.

04:32.510 --> 04:34.978
- SHE'S NOT--NOBODY--
- YOU HAVE A NICE GIRLFRIEND
WHO MAKES YOU NICE CAPPUCCINO.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.715
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HER?

04:36.820 --> 04:37.718

EXCEPT THAT THEY'RE GONNA
WANT TO BE YOUR FRIENDS.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.964
I DON'T NEED FRIENDS.
I HAVE HANK.

09:18.070 --> 09:19.924
OKAY, YOU HAVE HANK, HONEY.
BUT YOU NEED OTHER KIDS.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.201
- YOUR AGE.
- YOU NEED FRIENDS
THAT ARE YOUR AGE, OKAY?

09:22.320 --> 09:23.821
- NO, I DON'T.
- YES, YOU DO.

09:23.940 --> 09:25.419
I'M GOING TO HOMESCHOOL AND
WORK AT HANK'S STUDIO IN THE
AFTERNOONS. I'VE DECIDED.

09:25.530 --> 09:28.693
- MAX, WE HAVE TO--
- CAN I GO HAVE A SLICE OF
JAZMINS BANANA BREAD?

09:28.800 --> 09:29.903
[Kristina]
AFTER WE'RE DONE
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

09:30.010 --> 09:31.523
[Adam]
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS MORE LATER.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.561
[Max]
I DON'T LOOK FORWARD TO
THAT.

09:32.670 --> 09:33.978
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHERE'S THE BANANA BREAD?

09:35.290 --> 09:36.939
[knock at door]
YEAH.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.699
I ASK YOU A QUESTION,
I EXPECT A RESPONSE.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.539
WHATEVER.
I RESPONDED.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.505
I DON'T THINK
THAT A SHRUG IS A RESPONSE.

09:42.610 --> 09:44.430
- IT SORT OF IS.
- BUT IT'S NOT.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.405
HEY, RU BY.

09:46.510 --> 09:47.784
- HI.
- HEY.

09:47.890 --> 09:52.065
- BYE.
- EXCUSE ME, I WILL LEAVE
WHEN I FEEL LIKE LEAVING.

09:54.590 --> 09:58.697
- RUBY, HEY.
- HEY.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.552
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ANYBODY--WHO'S THIRSTY?

10:00.660 --> 10:02.309
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?
I GOT--

10:02.420 --> 10:04.524
YOU KNOW, I GOT THE LEMONADE,
THE FIZZY KIND THAT YOU LOVE.

10:04.630 --> 10:05.619
YOU LOVE THAT.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.526
LIKE, EIGHT YEARS AGO.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.323
TRUE.
YEAH, THAT WAS A WHILE AGO.

10:09.430 --> 10:10.977
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT,
WE'LL GET SOMETHING ELSE THEN.

10:11.090 --> 10:13.320
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T LET HER DO THAT.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.499
YOUR DAD BOUGHT YOU THE LEMONADE
FIZZY STUFF THAT YOU LIKE.

10:15.610 --> 10:17.191
YOU SUCK IT UP,
AND YOU DRINK IT.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.575
- I'M NOT GONNA DRINK IT.
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO DRINK IT.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.817
- NO, SHE CAN DRINK IT.
- IT'S GROSS.

10:20.930 --> 10:22.238
I'LL DRINK IT;
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

10:22.340 --> 10:23.443
BUT FORGET ABOUT IT.

10:23.550 --> 10:24.642
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS,
THOUGH?

10:24.760 --> 10:26.853
- IT'S NICE.
- WHERE DO I PUT MY CRAP?

10:26.970 --> 10:29.518
YOU CAN--I GOT A BEDROOM
RIGHT THERE.

10:29.620 --> 10:30.826
YOU CAN PUT ALL YOUR CRAP
IN THERE.

10:30.940 --> 10:33.488
EVERYTHING'S ALL SET UP.

10:33.590 --> 10:34.761
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.386
- WOW, HUH?
- SWEET.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.354
IT'S, YOU KNOW--

10:41.460 --> 10:43.462
SHE'S A JOY.

10:43.570 --> 10:46.949
- WELL, THAT'S TEENAGERS, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

10:50.270 --> 10:51.089
NOT BAD, RIGHT?

10:53.060 --> 10:55.335
YOU HAVE A CAPPUCCINO MACHINE.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.884
YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.332
YOU HATE CAPPUCCINO.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.849
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:00.970 --> 11:03.609
I THINK I HAD A BAD BATCH
THAT ONE TIME YOU TRIED.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.379
YEAH.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.412
- FOR THREE YEARS.
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO
HATE ANYTHING ANYWAY, IT'S--

11:07.520 --> 11:09.909
BUT ANYWAY, YOU LOOK GOOD.

11:10.010 --> 11:12.661
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.000
I FEEL LIKE A FREAKING MESS.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.974
- WELL.
- I SHOULD GO, ACTUALLY.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.421
I HAVE A TON OF STUFF TO DO.

11:18.530 --> 11:19.918
I'M GONNA LOOK AT A RENTAL,

11:20.020 --> 11:21.703
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ARE LIVING
OUT OF A HOTEL ROOM,

11:21.810 --> 11:23.186
WHICH I CANNOT AFFORD.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.050
YEAH, I KNOW.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.367
LISTEN, ANYTHING YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

11:26.470 --> 11:28.882
YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
IN ANY WAY, JUST LET ME KNOW.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.686
- THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.405
OH, MY GOD, GROSS.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.441
WHOSE UNDERWEAR ARE THESE?

11:34.550 --> 11:36.233
OKAY, LISTEN, WHERE WERE THEY?

11:36.350 --> 11:37.999
- THEY WERE IN THE DRAWER.
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

11:38.110 --> 11:39.589
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
IN THE DRAWER?

11:39.690 --> 11:41.066
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY ROOM.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.624
IT'S YOUR ROOM.
IT'S NOT YOUR DRAWER.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.937
I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA GO.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.691
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU.
WE'LL TALK.

11:47.810 --> 11:49.835
- WE SHOULD TALK.
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.180
- THANK YOU.
- I'M EXHAUSTED.
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

11:52.290 --> 11:55.157
ALL RIGHT.
DO YOU WANT ANY LUNCH?

11:55.260 --> 11:56.841
I GOT LUNCH.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.258
I'LL WRAP IT UP.

12:00.610 --> 12:02.293
FRANCE, WOW.

12:02.410 --> 12:04.810
THAT'S AWESOME.
WE SHOULD DO A SEMESTER ABROAD.

12:04.930 --> 12:07.023
- YEAH, WE SHOULD.
- IT WOULD BE A BLAST.

12:07.140 --> 12:08.027
I COULD TRY.

12:08.140 --> 12:09.209
YOU SHOULD.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.756
AMBER, HAVE YOU BEEN
TO EUROPE?

12:11.860 --> 12:13.373
NOPE.
NEVER HAVE.

12:13.490 --> 12:16.004
YOU SHOULD GO.
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY COOL.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.101
THE ONLY THING IS, LIKE,
LAUREN'S GONNA BE IN PRAGUE,

12:18.220 --> 12:20.029
SO I HAVE TO TAKE A TRAIN
TO SEE HER,

12:20.150 --> 12:22.072
AND I HONESTLY DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'LL DO THAT VERY OFTEN,

12:22.180 --> 12:24.319
BECAUSE IT'S TOO MUCH MONEY.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.943
- YEAH, NOT A TRAIN TO PRAGUE.
- YOU GUYS WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

12:26.050 --> 12:27.085
IT'S JUST A TRAIN RIDE.

12:27.190 --> 12:28.942
I JUST DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

12:29.050 --> 12:30.847
- THAT'S JUST TERRIBLE.
- I KNOW.

12:30.950 --> 12:34.158
- IT SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRY TALE.
- I KNOW, I'M JUST STRESSED.
I JUST HOPE WE SEE EACH OTHER.

12:34.270 --> 12:36.226
NO, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE,
THAT SOUNDS ROUGH.

12:36.340 --> 12:40.504
SORRY, I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY
TO BE COMPLAINING ABOUT EUROPE,

12:40.620 --> 12:42.645
SO I'M GONNA GET WATER.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.139
- WAIT, AMBER.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:46.240 --> 12:48.060
I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT
FOR, LIKE, ONE SECOND.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.898
I DON'T KNOW.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.580
THAT'S VERY WEIRD.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.247
- IT FEELS LIKE IT'S OKAY.
- I GOT IT.

12:53.350 --> 12:53.907
OKAY, GOOD.

12:54.010 --> 12:54.908
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:55.010 --> 12:56.625
OKAY, PRETTY GOOD.

12:56.740 --> 12:58.526
I THINK IT NEEDS TO
COME UP ON THE LEFT
A LITTLE BIT.

12:58.630 --> 13:01.463
- HEY.
- OH, SHOOT.

13:01.570 --> 13:04.038
- HI, GUYS.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.491

13:05.610 --> 13:07.840
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.645
YOU GUYS NEED SMOCKS

13:29.220 --> 13:30.482
WOW, YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.931
HI, GUYS.
THE KIDS ARE UPSTAIRS,

13:32.050 --> 13:33.449
IF YOU WANT TO
START PAINTING WITH THEM.

13:33.570 --> 13:34.662
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

13:34.770 --> 13:35.805
- OH, THEY'RE PUMPED.
- THANK YOU, GUYS,
FOR DOING THIS.

13:35.910 --> 13:37.150
I APPRECIATE IT.

13:37.260 --> 13:38.807
- SO TWO DAYS OUT, HUH?
- THANKS.

13:38.920 --> 13:39.807
HOW YOU FEEL?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.433
FEELING GOOD.

13:41.540 --> 13:42.984
NOT REALLY.
I AM SCARED,

13:43.090 --> 13:44.955
AND WE HAVE A LOT TO DO.

13:45.060 --> 13:46.129
- OH.

13:46.230 --> 13:47.743
- OKAY.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.612
YEAH? ARE YOU?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.608
HEY, YOU COULD BE THE ANSWER
TO OUR PLUMBING PROBLEMS.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.335
PROBABLY,
OR A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.680
JUST WONDERING
IF YOU COULD MAYBE STAY,

13:55.800 --> 13:58.200
AND MAYBE YOU COULD--I WAS
GONNA ORDER LUNCH FOR EVERYBODY

13:58.320 --> 13:59.651
IF YOU WANTED TO HANG OUT WITH--

13:59.760 --> 14:00.897

14:05.250 --> 14:06.933
IT'S--THE PLUMBING,
PARTICULARLY,

14:07.050 --> 14:09.018
IS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.327
IT'S REALLY BAD.
IT'S REALLY BAD, SO...

14:11.430 --> 14:12.738
I GOT SOME TOOLS IN THE TRUCK.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:12.850 --> 14:14.329

14:14.430 --> 14:16.295
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.
IF YOU HAVE ANY MEN...

14:16.400 --> 14:18.459
[laughter]
WELL, NOT IN THE TRUCK.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.719
BUT I'LL MAKE A FEW CALLS.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.788
- THAT'S AWESOME.

14:22.890 --> 14:24.687
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON THE KIDS.

14:24.790 --> 14:26.644
THANK YOU, GUYS.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.209
I MEAN,
I'M HAPPY IF YOU'RE HAPPY,

14:32.310 --> 14:34.039
BUT I MISS THE HOUSE,
DON'T YOU?

14:34.140 --> 14:36.313
- NO, NOT REALLY.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.559
YOU DON'T MISS WORKING ON YOUR

14:38.670 --> 14:40.069
NO.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.943

14:42.050 --> 14:43.699

14:43.810 --> 14:45.459
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT--
OH HIT ME, PLEASE.

14:45.570 --> 14:46.286
EXCUSE ME, HONEY.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.675
CAN WE STOP CHATTING?
I NEED TO--

14:48.780 --> 14:50.361
I'M NOT CHATTING, DAD.
I'M BONDING.

14:50.470 --> 14:52.506
- WELL, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
- WHY?

14:52.610 --> 14:55.261
ARE YOU COUNTING CARDS, DAD?

14:55.370 --> 14:57.190
BEN AFFLECK GOT IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR THAT.

14:57.310 --> 15:01.519
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO HIT, SIR?
- DAD, DO YOU WANT ANOTHER CARD?

15:01.620 --> 15:03.895
DAD?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.615
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT YET,

WE'RE AT THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW,

15:07.210 --> 15:08.689
AND THE DOCTOR'S GONNA

15:08.800 --> 15:10.381

16:37.410 --> 16:38.889
MY MOM'S REALLY UPSET.
I SHOULD--

16:38.990 --> 16:40.617
- YEAH. YEAH, GO.
- OKAY.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.199
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

16:42.310 --> 16:45.063
HEY, YOUR MOM HAS TO STEP OUT
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

16:45.170 --> 16:48.105
SO I AM GONNA MAKE YOU GUYS
SOME DINNER TONIGHT.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.416
- CAN YOU MAKE TACOS?
- HERE?

16:49.520 --> 16:53.240
YES.

16:53.350 --> 16:55.079
OKAY.
THE BAD NEWS IS,

16:55.180 --> 16:57.045
I HAPPEN TO BE THE WORLD'S
GREATEST CLUE PLAYER.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.526
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- SO THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.

16:58.630 --> 17:00.188
THAT'S WHY I BEAT YOU, LIKE,
THE LAST....

17:02.570 --> 17:04.913
- OKAY, BACK OFF. BACK OFF.
- DAD.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.157
- SIR...
- NO, REALLY.

17:06.260 --> 17:08.603
WHEN YOU FELL,
DID YOU PASS OUT?

17:08.710 --> 17:10.291
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...

17:10.400 --> 17:12.982
HEY, WHEN AM I GONNA GET
A CHANCE TO SEE A DOCTOR HERE?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.169
I'M THE ON-CALL DOCTOR, SIR.

17:14.270 --> 17:16.124
- WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE, 14?
- DAD.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.753
NO, I'M NOT 14.

17:17.860 --> 17:19.304
SO DON'T WORRY.

17:19.410 --> 17:20.274
WERE YOU THERE WHEN HE FELL?

17:20.380 --> 17:21.608
- YEAH.
- SHE WAS THERE.

17:21.730 --> 17:23.129
COULD YOU TELL
IF HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS?

17:23.240 --> 17:24.719
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO,
RIGHT, DAD?

17:24.830 --> 17:25.899
I THINK HE JUST KIND OF
GOT A LITTLE DISORIENTED.

17:26.010 --> 17:27.136
- GOT A LITTLE DIZZY.
- BUT--

17:27.250 --> 17:28.797
I STOOD UP TOO FAST,
THAT'S ALL.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.482
OKAY, WHAT DID YOU FEEL
BEFORE YOU PASSED OUT?

17:31.600 --> 17:33.181
I FELT LIKE
I HAD A GREAT HAND.

17:33.290 --> 17:34.621
DAD, THAT'S NOT
WHAT HE'S ASKING.

17:34.740 --> 17:35.900
I MEAN, LIKE, PHYSICALLY.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.180
DID YOU HAVE
ANY CHEST DISCOMFORT?

17:37.290 --> 17:38.769
NOT SURE, REALLY.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.847
DAD.
HE HAS A HEART CONDITION.

17:39.950 --> 17:41.360
HE TAKES PILLS.
WHAT ARE YOU--

17:41.470 --> 17:42.869
TELL HIM WHAT THE PILLS ARE.
WHAT ARE THE PILLS?

17:42.990 --> 17:44.218
GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.298
NO, NO,
I'LL NEED THE SPECIFICS OF THAT.

17:46.410 --> 17:48.719
DID YOU HAVE ANY VISUAL CHANGES,
HEADACH ES?

17:48.820 --> 17:51.163
OH, MY GOD,
I GOT A LITTLE WARM, ALL RIGHT?

17:51.270 --> 17:52.953
OKAY.
HAD YOU BEEN DRINKING?

17:53.070 --> 17:54.719
WELL, HELL YEAH,
I'D BEEN DRINKING.

17:54.830 --> 17:56.161
THIS IS VEGAS, FOR PETE'S SAKE.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.202
GEEZ, IT'S NO BIG DEAL, HONEST.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.481
IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE DIZZY SPELL.

17:59.590 --> 18:01.342
- OKAY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:01.450 --> 18:02.929
I'M GLAD YOU'RE FEELING
BETTER, MR. BRAVERMAN.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.348
WE'RE JUST GONNA
TAKE A FEW TESTS,

18:04.460 --> 18:05.939
TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY?

18:06.050 --> 18:06.903
- THANK YOU.
- I'LL BE BACK.

18:07.010 --> 18:08.238
GIVE ME A 12 LEAD,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.760
325 MILLIGRAMS OF ASPIRIN,
AND AN ECHO.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.905
OKAY.
WILL DO, DOCTOR.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.180
OH, JUST ONE SECOND.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.460
EXCUSE ME, SORRY.

18:15.570 --> 18:17.253
SO DID HE HAVE A HEART ATTACK?

18:17.370 --> 18:19.463
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL FIND OUT, THOUGH.

18:19.580 --> 18:20.330
HEY, HEY, HEY.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.782
I CAN HEAR YOU OVER HERE.

18:21.890 --> 18:22.606
- DAD.
- HE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.641
THANK YOU.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.377
[Camille]
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YET.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.926
THEY'RE STILL DOING TESTS.

18:28.030 --> 18:31.921
ADAM, COULD YOU PLEASE
TALK TO THE DOCTOR YOURSELF?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.133
I MEAN, I KNOW SARAH'S THERE.

18:34.250 --> 18:38.528
BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS SO GREAT
IN A CRISIS.

18:38.630 --> 18:39.597
SWEETIE.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.554
- HI.
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
COME OVER HERE.

18:41.670 --> 18:44.138
JULIA'S HERE.

18:44.260 --> 18:45.488
OKAY, YOU'LL CALL ME,
THOUGH, RIGHT,

18:45.600 --> 18:47.044
AS SOON AS YOU TALK TO HER?
OKAY, GREAT.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.912
LOVE YOU TOO.
BYE.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.180
CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.609
NO, IT'S OKAY.
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.291
- YEAH?
- HE'S IN A GOOD HOSPITAL.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.288
- OH, GOOD.
- A VERY GOOD HOSPITAL.

18:56.410 --> 18:59.026
AND HE NEVER LOST CONSCIOUSNESS,
SO THAT'S GOOD.

18:59.130 --> 19:01.303
- THAT'S GOOD?
- AND SARAH'S THERE, SO...

19:01.410 --> 19:04.061
- YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?
- NO, I'M FINE.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.410
SO...

19:05.520 --> 19:06.726
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

19:06.830 --> 19:09.060
I JUST CAME FOR YOU. I MEAN,
JOEL WAS OVER.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.319
HE CAME OVER RIGHT
WHEN YOU CALLED,
SO HE'S WITH THE KIDS.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.626
JOEL.
IT WAS SO GOOD TO SEE HIM.

19:12.730 --> 19:14.004
HE LOOKS GREAT.

19:14.110 --> 19:15.907
YOU MENTIONED THAT
MORE THAN ONCE.

19:16.010 --> 19:18.183
AND KRISTINA TOLD ME
THAT HE WAS UP

19:18.290 --> 19:19.837
PRACTICALLY HALF THE NIGHT
AT THE SCHOOL,

19:19.950 --> 19:21.019
FIXING THE PLUMBING.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.736
- YEAH, I HEARD THAT TOO.
- YEAH, SO YOU TWO ARE TALKING.

19:23.850 --> 19:25.056
NO, NOT REALLY.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.014
SO WHAT HOSPITAL IS HE AT?

19:27.130 --> 19:28.609
- SUNRISE.
- OKAY, SUNRISE.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.883
BUT I SAW THE WAY
HE LOOKED AT YOU, YOU KNOW.

19:30.990 --> 19:34.369
AND I GOT THE SENSE THAT HE MAY
FINALLY BE COMING AROUND.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.402
WELL, HE MAY HAVE
WAITED TOO LONG.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.238
OH, COME ON.
MEANING WHAT?

19:38.340 --> 19:40.649
MEANING I WAITED FOR HIM
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

19:40.760 --> 19:43.035
AND I HAD TO STOP WAITING,
AND I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.029
HEY, I KNOW HEADSTRONG MEN,
RIGHT?

19:46.150 --> 19:48.903
I KNOW IT CAN BE
VERY FRUSTRATING.

19:49.010 --> 19:52.138
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE
LIKE JOEL, YOU KNOW,

19:52.260 --> 19:53.591
YOU DON'T GIVE UP ON HIM.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.669
OKAY, HOW ABOUT I
TAKE CARE OF YOU?

19:56.780 --> 19:58.463
WHICH IS WHAT I'M HERE TO DO.
YOU HAVE A SEAT.

19:58.570 --> 20:00.322
- I'M OKAY!
- LET ME GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.158
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK?

20:02.270 --> 20:03.294
YOU DON'T WANT THIS, DO YOU?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.470
- I'M OKAY.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:13.660 --> 20:15.799
IT'S OKAY?
PASTA HOT ENOUGH?

20:15.900 --> 20:17.720
YEP.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.937
MOVING BACK, RIGHT?

20:25.250 --> 20:27.969
- LOOKS LIKE IT.
- YEAH.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.320
FULL CIRCLE.

20:32.330 --> 20:33.945
HOW'S THINGS?

20:34.060 --> 20:34.947
LIFE?

20:39.060 --> 20:42.166
LIFE?

20:42.270 --> 20:43.123
I DON'T KNOW,
FINE.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.889
- YEAH?
- MM-HMM.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.753
SCHOOL?
HOW--HOW'S SCHOOL?

20:47.860 --> 20:50.272
- YOU KNOW.
- HOW ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS?

20:50.380 --> 20:54.692
THAT MUST'VE BEEN HARD,
LEAVING THEM IN MINNESOTA.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.869
IT'S FINE.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.043
JUST FINE?
THAT'S IT?

21:01.700 --> 21:03.520
PRETTY MUCH.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.664
YEAH.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.740
YOUR INITIAL WORK-UP LOOKS
NEGATIVE FOR A HEART ATTACK.

21:11.850 --> 21:14.023
- THANK YOU. SEE?
- OH, YEAH, HUH?

21:14.130 --> 21:16.234
DO I KNOW MY BODY OR WHAT?

21:16.340 --> 21:18.649
- GOOD JOB, DAD.
- I TOLD YOU.
[chuckles]

21:18.760 --> 21:19.852
OKAY, HONEY,
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.305
OH, NO, SIR.
NOT YET, SIR.
I'M NOT DISCHARGING YOU.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.684
- YOU'RE NOT?
- NO, YOUR ELECT ROCARDIOGRAM
RESULTS WERE FINE.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.688
BUT WE'RE WAITING ON THE RESULTS
OF YOUR ECHO.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.961
OH, NO,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DOCTOR.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.595
I TOLD YOU,
I HAD A FEW TOO MANY MARTINIS,
AND I GOT UP TOO FAST.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.349
LISTEN TO HIM, DAD.
HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE?

21:35.460 --> 21:36.631
WELL, JUST TO BE SURE,

21:36.740 --> 21:37.764
I WANT OUR ATTENDING
CARDIOLOGIST

21:37.880 --> 21:39.086
TO SEE YOU TOMORROW.

21:39.190 --> 21:40.532
HE MIGHT RECOMMEND
FURTHER TESTS,

21:40.640 --> 21:42.323
POSSIBLY A CORONARY
CATH ETERIZATION.

21:42.430 --> 21:43.499
- HUH?
- WHAT'S THAT?

21:43.610 --> 21:45.123
A LIQUID DYE IS INJECTED

21:45.230 --> 21:47.881
INTO THE ARTERIES OF
YOUR HEART THROUGH A CATHETER.

21:47.990 --> 21:49.605
WE USUALLY GO IN THROUGH THE LEG
OR THE GROIN.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.335
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANWVHERE
NEAR MY GROIN.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.850
- IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.235
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
HI, IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

21:55.340 --> 21:57.547
I WANT TO TALK TO THE DOCTOR.
MOM WANTS ME TO TALK
TO THE DOCTOR.

21:57.660 --> 21:58.547
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE,
IT'S FINE.

21:58.660 --> 22:00.719
TELL MOM TO RELAX, OKAY?
I'M HANDLING IT.

22:00.830 --> 22:02.934
NOBODY'S SAYING
YOU'RE NOT HANDLING IT, SARAH.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.769
[Zeek]
TELL HIM THEY'RE GONNA
TRY TO GET INTO MY GROIN, OKAY?

22:04.870 --> 22:06.553
- SARAH, IS THAT DAD?
- I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

22:06.670 --> 22:08.171
OF COURSE, HE'S DAD.
HE'S BEING DAD.

22:08.290 --> 22:09.450
NO, YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT
HE LISTENS TO THOSE DOCTORS.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.255
- I'VE GOT TO GO. BYE.
- ...OR I'LL RIP IT OUT MYSELF.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.011
- DAD, PLEASE.
- IF YOU SIGN OUT
AGAINST OUR RECOMMENDATION,

22:14.120 --> 22:15.667
YOU'LL HAVE TO SIGN AN AMA FORM

22:15.780 --> 22:17.327
THAT SAYS
YOU'RE REFUSING TREATMENT

22:17.430 --> 22:19.603
AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANY REPERCUSSIONS.

22:19.710 --> 22:21.018
- DAD, COME ON.
- NO.

22:21.130 --> 22:22.950
THERE IS NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

22:23.060 --> 22:24.857
YOU GO GET THE FORM.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.404
HERE'S THE WAY
IT'S GONNA WORK, ALL RIGHT?

22:26.510 --> 22:27.852
I'M GONNA LEAVE HERE.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.133
AND THEN EVENTUALLY,
I WILL SEE MY DOCTOR.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.368
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I AM GONNA SPEND MY BIRTHDAY
WITH MY DAUGHTER IN VEGAS.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.583
- JUST CALM DOWN.
- AND WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

22:35.690 --> 22:38.488
DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA
SPEND MY TIME HERE IN THIS
RINKY-DINK HOSPITAL...

22:38.590 --> 22:39.796
[Sarah]
DAD, DAD, LOWER YOUR
VOICE. IT' S OKAY

22:39.910 --> 22:42.174
[Zeek]
WITH A DOCTOR THAT'S
BARELY 18 YEARS OLD?

22:42.290 --> 22:43.075
- DAD, STOP.
- YOU'RE CRAZY.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.044
- I'M SORRY.
- GO GET THE FORM,

22:44.150 --> 22:46.209
OR I'M GONNA RIP THIS
OUT OF MY ARM MYSELF.

22:46.330 --> 22:47.456
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
MAYBE GET THE FORM.

22:47.570 --> 22:49.663
- I'LL HAVE THE NURSE WRITE--
- THANK YOU.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.156
DAD.

22:54.710 --> 22:55.779
NOW IT'S GOING
STRAIGHT TO VOICE MAIL.

22:55.890 --> 22:57.573
RINGING OR JUST GOING
STRAIGHT TO VOICE--

22:57.680 --> 22:59.363
- STRAIGHT TO VOICE MAIL.
- SO SHE TURNED HER PHONE OFF.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.708
- IT'S NOT RINGING, YEAH.
- SHE'S AVOIDING YOU.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.503
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT
SARAH HUNG UP ON ME? OUR
DAD COLLAPSED.

23:02.620 --> 23:06.238
YES, I ABSOLUTELY CAN BELIEVE
THAT SARAH HUNG UP ON YOU. SHE
ORCHESTRATED A TRIP TO VEGAS--

23:06.350 --> 23:08.409
I DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS
TO OUR FATHER. THIS IS UN
EXCEPTABLE.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.442
YOU DON'T TALK TO ME, MR.
VEGAS? YOU JUST LEAVE ME
OUT THE LOOP.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.619
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA
FOCUS ON? OUR FATHER'S
HAVING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY

23:12.730 --> 23:14.106
WITH MY LEAST-QUALIFIED
SIBLING--

23:14.220 --> 23:15.835
MY SECOND LEAST-QUALIFIED
SIBLING.

23:15.940 --> 23:16.861
OH.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.072
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HOSPITAL HE'S IN.

23:18.180 --> 23:19.499
SUNRISE.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.079
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
HE'S AT SUNRISE?

23:21.190 --> 23:23.420
I'VE HAD A FEW DIFFERENT
MEDICAL EMERGENCIES WHILE ON
TRIPS TO VEGAS.

23:23.540 --> 23:24.359
YEAH? LIKE WHAT?

23:24.470 --> 23:26.563
I HAD BAD,
BAD FOOD POISONING ONCE.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.056
AND THEN I HAD SOME BODY GLITTER
CAUGHT IN MY EYE.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.570
LAS VEGAS, PLEASE.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.716
AND THEN I HAD A WEIRD RASH
FROM SOMEONE'S PERFUME.

23:31.820 --> 23:34.027
SUNRISE HOSPITAL.
A RASH FROM WHOSE PERFUME?

23:34.130 --> 23:36.303
- A PERFORMER'S PERFUME.
- YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS DUMB.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.924
DAD COLLAPSED, HE'S IN VEGAS.
LET'S GO. WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

23:39.030 --> 23:41.134
YES, LET'S GO!
STOPPING AT THE ATM.
LET'S GET THE HELL OVER THERE.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.446
- NO, WE'RE NOT GAMBLING.
- YEAH.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.137
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.721
WATCHING PAINT DRY.

23:49.840 --> 23:53.424
- I DON'T LIKE METAPHORS.
- IT'S NOT REALLY
A METAPHOR, MAX.

23:53.530 --> 23:56.499
WE ARE LITERALLY WATCHING
PAINT DRY.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.814
HEY, BUD?

24:07.920 --> 24:11.811
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR
WAS SO INCREDIBLY PAINFUL--

24:11.930 --> 24:16.378
- THEY PEED IN MY CANTEEN.
- I KNOW.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.175
AND IT WAS SO AWFUL.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.556
IT WAS.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.002
AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S PART
OF THE REASON WHY

24:23.110 --> 24:26.523
YOUR DAD AND I DREAMT OF
CREATING A SCHOOL LIKE THIS...

24:29.150 --> 24:32.358
SO THAT EVERY KID COULD
COME TO SCHOOL AND FIT IN,

24:32.470 --> 24:34.677
NOT BE AFRAID.

24:34.780 --> 24:38.637
NEVER BE BULLIED.
EVER.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.261
AND WE DON'T WANT THIS SCHOOL
JUST TO BE,

24:42.370 --> 24:45.954
YOU KNOW, AN OKAY PLACE.

24:46.070 --> 24:49.892
WE WANT IT TO BE A PLACE WHERE
EVERYBODY CAN JUST BE HAPPY.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.791
WE WANT IT TO BE WONDERFUL.

24:56.420 --> 24:59.287
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

24:59.390 --> 25:02.075
YOU SHOULD'VE ASKED ME FIRST.

25:06.430 --> 25:08.739
[sighs]

25:11.400 --> 25:12.947
I LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY.

25:14.130 --> 25:15.461
[knock at door]

25:15.580 --> 25:17.366
- HEY, CAN I COME IN?
- HEY.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.994
WHAT'S UP?

25:20.100 --> 25:23.513
I AM KIND OF UPSET WITH YOU,
AND I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING,

25:23.620 --> 25:24.826
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

25:24.930 --> 25:28.969
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE TREATING ME

25:29.070 --> 25:31.766
LIKE I'M SOME GIRL THAT YOU
DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW

25:31.870 --> 25:33.792
AND CAN'T MAKE TIME FOR.
AND IT'S, LIKE,

25:33.910 --> 25:35.628
I LOVE YOU,
AND I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU,

25:35.740 --> 25:38.254
AND YOU'RE REALLY
HURTING MY FEELINGS.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.158
[sighs]

25:41.260 --> 25:42.739
I'M PREGNANT.

25:45.820 --> 25:49.028
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.118
AMBER.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.162
WHAT?

25:54.270 --> 25:56.579
IS THIS GOOD OR BAD?

25:56.690 --> 25:58.271
YOU TELL ME.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.063
OKAY.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.072
WHO ELSE KNOWS?

26:10.180 --> 26:11.044
JUST YOU.

26:13.290 --> 26:15.042
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

26:15.150 --> 26:17.038
OH, MY GOD.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.561
OKAY, LET'S--YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, ARE YOU?

26:20.680 --> 26:23.057
- NO.
- OKAY,
I'M JUST GONNA STAY HERE.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.957
DO YOU HAVE, LIKE,
WINE OR, LIKE--

26:25.060 --> 26:27.858
OKAY, YOU CAN DRINK,
LIKE, TEA, RIGHT?

26:27.960 --> 26:30.167
THAT'S, LIKE, A CALMING THING
THAT PEOPLE DO.

26:30.270 --> 26:32.921
SO, UM...

26:33.030 --> 26:34.440
DO YOU WANT
BOY OR GIRL TEA?

26:34.550 --> 26:35.869
[laughs]

26:35.970 --> 26:38.200
[knocking at door]
SARAH. SARAH.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.003
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME
THAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE HERE.

26:40.110 --> 26:41.759
I TOLD YOU
I COULD HANDLE THIS MYSELF.

26:41.870 --> 26:43.861
- WHERE'S DAD?
- HE'S IN HIS ROOM, ASLEEP.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.288
- HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM.
- HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM.

26:45.390 --> 26:47.733
- HE BETTER NOT BE IN HIS ROOM.
- IF HE'S THERE THEN THERE'S
TROUBLE.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.319
ARE YOU SURE
YOU HAD THE RIGHT ROOM?

26:49.430 --> 26:51.489
- LOOK, RIGHT HERE?
- YOU'RE SURE HE'S IN HERE?

26:51.610 --> 26:54.113
WELL, HE PROMISED ME HE WOULD
TELL ME IF HE WENT ANYWHERE.

26:54.230 --> 26:55.561
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE HE WOULD BE.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.432
- DAD.
- OKAY, WE ALREADY DID THIS.
WE GOTTA GET IN THIS ROOM.

26:57.540 --> 26:58.643
DAD.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.842
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON A SECOND.
HEY, EXCUSE ME.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.951
WE'RE WORRIED OUR FATHER
MIGHT BE INSIDE AND UNCONSCIOUS.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.755
COULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR
FOR US, PLEASE? THANK YOU.

27:03.860 --> 27:04.758
[Crosby]
MAYBE HE'S TAKING A NAP
WITH EARPLUGS IN.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.066
[Sarah]
YEAH, MAYBE HE HAS
EARPLUGS IN.

27:06.170 --> 27:08.206
[Crosby]
WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS,
WE PROMISE.

27:08.310 --> 27:10.585
- THANK YOU. DAD?
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:10.690 --> 27:12.271
- HEY.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.654
- HE'S NOT EVEN--

27:13.770 --> 27:16.341
- SARAH, WHAT THE HELL?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT THE HELL?

27:16.460 --> 27:18.519
[Adam]
I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU GUYS
THINK WE SHOULD SPLIT UP

27:18.630 --> 27:19.938
OR JUST KEEP ON LOOKING?

27:20.050 --> 27:21.768
[Crosby]
WELL, LOOK FOR CIGAR
SMOKE AND LISTEN FOR SWEARING.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.802
I TOLD HIM TO
STAY IN HIS ROOM, I SWEAR.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.218
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'LL CHECK WITH HOTEL SECURITY.

27:25.330 --> 27:27.150
THEY CAN CHECK ALL THE HOSPITALS
AND PRECINCTS.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.807
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO
CHECK ANYWHERE.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.296
LOOK AT THIS, 12:00.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.708
- HEY.
- HEY, DAD.

27:31.820 --> 27:33.435
- OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- DAD.

27:33.540 --> 27:34.882
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

27:34.990 --> 27:36.161
OH, IT'S PART OF
MY BIRTHDAY SURPRISE.

27:36.270 --> 27:37.714
- NO
- THIS IS NOT A BIRTHDAY
SURPRISE.

27:37.820 --> 27:38.787
WE'RE ON A RESCUE MISSION HERE--

27:38.890 --> 27:40.266
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
STAYING IN YOUR ROOM.

27:40.380 --> 27:41.756
...YOU CHECKED YOURSELF OUT
OF A HOSPITAL AGAINST
DOCTOR'S ORDERS?

27:41.860 --> 27:44.727
- WE WERE SCARED.
- HONEY, I DIDN'T WANT TO
WAKE YOU. I MEAN, COME ON, GEEZ.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.138
DAD, YOU SCARED US
HALF TO DEATH.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.797
CAN WE STAY
A LITTLE POSITIVE HERE?
I MEAN WHAT THE HELL.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.344
WHEN DO WE GET A CHANCE
TO BE IN VEGAS TOGETHER?

27:49.460 --> 27:51.348
WE'RE NOT IN VEGAS TOGETHER.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

27:51.460 --> 27:52.791
NO, WE'RE NOT GETTING
OUT OF HERE.

27:52.910 --> 27:54.070
I'M GONNA BE SPLITTING
THOSE EIGHTS, HERE WE GO.

27:54.180 --> 27:56.216
- NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
- STOP THAT.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.526
- NO MORE GAMBLING.
- STOP THAT. I'M SPLITTING.

27:57.640 --> 27:58.732
[Sarah]
DON'T BET, DAD.
COME ON.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.353
CROSBY, WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH EIGHTS?

28:00.470 --> 28:01.949
YOU GOT TO SPLIT EIGHT.

28:02.050 --> 28:03.529
HANK ALWAYS SAYS YOU DO
HAVE TO SPLIT EIGHTS.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.676
- OH! OH! OKAY.
- YOU'RE GETTING PAID.

28:05.780 --> 28:07.395
LET HER PAY YOU,
LET HER PAY YOU.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.478
- OH, PAY, PAY, PAY, PAY, PAY.
- DON'T TOUCH IT.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.616
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU, ADAM?

28:11.720 --> 28:14.336
- WE GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
- AND BY THE WAY,
THANKS FOR RATTING ME OUT.

28:14.450 --> 28:16.020
OH, THANK YOU.
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
GONNA STAY IN YOUR ROOM.

28:16.140 --> 28:17.994
I JUST CARE ABOUT YOU. SORRY.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.657
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU BACK TO
THE HOSPITAL TO SORT THIS OUT.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.034
YOU BASICALLY HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

28:21.140 --> 28:23.199
I DID NOT HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.038
I HAD AN EVENT.

28:25.150 --> 28:27.903
AND THE EVENT IS OVER,
ALL RIGHT?

28:28.010 --> 28:29.898
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.216
I'M GONNA TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.

28:31.330 --> 28:33.707
I HAPPEN TO BE
IN A MAJOR HEATER.

28:33.810 --> 28:36.699
I'M UP 2,500 BUCKS.
NOW YOU GUYS GOT A CHOICE.

28:36.810 --> 28:38.869
YOU CAN GO BACK TO BERKELEY,
OR YOU CAN STAY.

28:38.990 --> 28:42.266
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL BANKROLL YOU, 500 APIECE.

28:42.370 --> 28:43.439
YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME,

28:43.540 --> 28:46.509
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MENTION
MY HEART ANYMORE. ALL RIGHT?

28:46.620 --> 28:48.064
- DAD.
- SO IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

28:48.170 --> 28:49.956
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE FUN.
ENJOY IT.

28:50.070 --> 28:51.446
- DAD!
- WE'VE GOT CHRISTINA.

28:51.550 --> 28:53.586
WE'VE GOT A HOT TABLE.
LET'S GO.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.726
DAD...

28:55.830 --> 28:58.037
I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY CRAPS
IF WE'RE GONNA STAY.

28:58.150 --> 28:59.697
AFTER A FEW HANDS, CAN WE MOVE
TO A DIFFERENT GAME?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.244
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU, SON.
SIT DOWN.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.861
OKAY, THEN I GUESS I'M IN.
TEN, TEN, TEN.

29:02.980 --> 29:04.242
- THAT'S A LOT.
- LOOK AT THIS, LOOK AT THIS.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.385
JUST, LIKE, ONE HAND?

29:06.500 --> 29:08.593
HE SEEMS FINE.

29:08.710 --> 29:09.916
LET'S JUST PLAY ONE HAND.
HE LOOKS FINE.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.226
YOU LOOK FINE, RIGHT, DAD?
YOU FEEL FINE?

29:11.330 --> 29:15.505
- YEAH, HONEY, I'M DOING GREAT.
- THIS FAMILY IS SICK. SICK.

29:15.610 --> 29:16.577
23!
[all cheering]

29:16.680 --> 29:19.854
THERE'S A BREAK!
FIRST HAND OUT.

29:23.100 --> 29:23.953
[announcer commentating on TV]

29:24.070 --> 29:26.447
ACROSS THE 45 TO 50.

29:26.550 --> 29:29.929
ALL RIGHT,
I COULD MAKE THAT TACKLE, GUYS.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.553
SOMEBODY MAKE A TACKLE.

29:31.660 --> 29:33.241
[knock at door]
HANK, IT'S SANDY.

29:33.350 --> 29:37.696
OH, IT'S OPEN, I THINK.
COME IN.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.357
- HEY.
- HEY.

29:39.460 --> 29:40.688
WHAT'S UP?

29:40.810 --> 29:43.563
- HOW'D IT GO?
- IT WENT GOOD.

29:43.670 --> 29:44.910
WE SPENT THE DAY
IN THE APARTMENT.

29:45.020 --> 29:49.059
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S TAKING A BREAK RIGHT NOW.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.404
WE NEED TO TALK.

29:55.790 --> 29:59.442
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
ABOUT THE UNDERWEAR...

29:59.550 --> 30:00.926
I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT SARAH.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.827
SHE'S MORE THAN
JUST MY ASSISTANT.

30:03.940 --> 30:05.999
WE'RE DATING.

30:06.110 --> 30:07.486
LISTEN, I DON'T GIVE A CRAP,
HANK.

30:07.590 --> 30:11.003
JUST KEEP HER STUPID UNDERWEAR
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.907
SHE'S NOT LIVING HERE, IS SHE?

30:13.010 --> 30:15.979
- NO, NO, NO.
- OKAY, GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

30:16.090 --> 30:17.114
YEAH.

30:17.220 --> 30:19.324
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

30:19.430 --> 30:21.182
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH RUBY.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.292
IT'S NOT WORKING,
THE TWO OF US.

30:24.400 --> 30:27.779
AND SHE JUST--SHE PUSHES MY
BUTTONS LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

30:27.890 --> 30:30.051
AND I JUST--I CAN'T HANDLE HER
HALF THE TIME.

30:30.170 --> 30:33.617
I KNOW, I KNOW.
SHE'S FRUSTRATING.
SHE CAN BE FRUSTRATING.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.201
THE TRUTH IS,
I DIDN'T JUST GET TRANSFERRED
TO SAN FRANCISCO.

30:37.310 --> 30:39.870
I ASKED TO BE TRANSFERRED HERE.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.028
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

30:43.150 --> 30:45.414
SHE GOT INTO A BAD GROUP
IN MINNESOTA,

30:45.530 --> 30:48.044
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.630
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME.

30:50.740 --> 30:53.459
I NEED US TO DO THIS TOGETHER,

30:53.570 --> 30:56.846
AND I NEED IT TO BE 50/50.

30:56.950 --> 30:58.815
I WANT TO.
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO 50/ 50.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.057
OKAY, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.094
- I MEAN, YEAH.
- OKAY?

31:02.200 --> 31:05.499
I'M UP FOR THAT.
HEY.

31:05.620 --> 31:06.928
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:07.030 --> 31:08.509
WHERE AM I STAYING TONIGHT?

31:08.620 --> 31:09.780
YOU'RE STAYING HERE TONIGHT.
DON'T WORRY. NOTHING--NOTHING'S
CHANGED.

31:09.900 --> 31:13.347
NO, WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.
WE'RE GONNA GO TO ALCATRAZ
TOMORROW.

31:13.450 --> 31:16.863
- OKAY.
- SO, YEAH. SO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO
MOM.

31:16.970 --> 31:19.279
- GOOD NIGHT.
- WELL, NO.
GIVE HER A HUG.

31:19.390 --> 31:21.005
- NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.
- GOD.

31:21.120 --> 31:21.939
WELL,
SHE SHOULD GIVE YOU A HUG.

31:22.050 --> 31:23.904
- I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.523
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
THE WINDOW DOESN'T EVEN OPEN.

31:26.640 --> 31:27.664
IT'S LIKE A FREAKING PRISON.

31:27.780 --> 31:29.702
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NOT A--
YOU'LL SEE A PRISON TOMORROW,

31:29.810 --> 31:31.744
AND YOU'LL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

31:31.850 --> 31:34.398
IT OPENS.

31:34.510 --> 31:35.738
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.169
THANK YOU.

31:38.340 --> 31:40.547
THANK YOU.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.584
I COULDN'T HELP IT.
IT WAS, LIKE, SO FUNNY.

31:43.690 --> 31:44.964
WE HATED THE TEACHER.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.300
AND LAUREN--
THAT'S HOW WE BONDED.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.559
LIKE, SHE THOUGHT
THAT THE TEACHER SUCKED TOO.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.275
IT ENDED UP BEING, LIKE,

31:51.390 --> 31:53.836
THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY SEMESTER
THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE TEACHER.

31:53.940 --> 31:56.420
BUT, LIKE,
HOW DID YOU MAKE THE TRANSITION

31:56.530 --> 31:57.315
FROM JUST BEING FRIENDS?

31:57.430 --> 31:59.011
LIKE, WHAT--
HOW DID THAT GO?

31:59.120 --> 31:59.870
I MEAN, DID YOU
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE?

31:59.980 --> 32:01.208
- AMBER.
- WHAT?

32:01.330 --> 32:02.228
I WANT TO KNOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

32:02.330 --> 32:03.183
NO, YOU'RE BEING SO NICE TO
ME. LIKE...

32:03.300 --> 32:05.746
- PLEASE.
- I'M BEING SELFISH AND BORING.

32:05.850 --> 32:07.056
DON'T BE CRAZY, OKAY?

32:07.160 --> 32:09.264
IT'S, LIKE--
I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOU.

32:09.370 --> 32:10.098
I MISS YOU.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.543
PLUS, IT'S, LIKE,
A NICE DISTRACT ION

32:12.650 --> 32:15.619
FROM ALL THE CRAZY,
STRESSFUL STUFF I HAVE GOING ON.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.062
OKAY.

32:17.170 --> 32:19.547
BUT DID YOU ALWAYS LIKE GIRLS,

32:19.660 --> 32:21.230
OR DO YOU STILL LIKE GUYS?

32:21.350 --> 32:22.726
OR, LIKE,
HOW DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU?

32:22.830 --> 32:23.797
I DON'T KNOW.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.458
I WISH
THAT I COULD, LIKE, EXPLAIN IT.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.245
LIKE, WHEN I WAS WITH ALEX,
LIKE, I LOVED HIM.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.668
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
I WAS FAKING IT

32:29.770 --> 32:32.739
OR LIKE I WAS
MISSING SOMETHING.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.046
IT WAS JUST DIFFERENT.

32:34.150 --> 32:35.390

32:45.960 --> 32:47.439
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- IT'S A GOOD EXCUSE.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.814

32:49.930 --> 32:52.205
WE'RE REAL-LIFE GROWN-UPS, DUDE.

32:52.310 --> 32:54.346

THE WORST SOMETIMES.

33:11.780 --> 33:12.633

33:42.500 --> 33:43.398
THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING
THEIR PHONES.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.398
I DON'T KNOW.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.422
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO,
SO MOM JUST WENT TO BED.

33:46.540 --> 33:49.532

34:25.850 --> 34:28.159
[chuckles and cries]

34:30.060 --> 34:33.166
I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE
I WAS SO UPSET.

36:19.790 --> 36:22.031
I HAVE TO TELL YOU--

36:22.140 --> 36:22.993
NO ONE'S GONNA

37:01.110 --> 37:02.691
I'LL SING A SONG

37:02.800 --> 37:05.769
OH, MAX, WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE

37:05.870 --> 37:07.451
I HAVE OUTDONE MYSELF.

37:07.570 --> 37:08.946
AND I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

37:09.050 --> 37:10.779
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT GRANDPA.
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.428
- OKAY.
- MAX, THIS SANDWICH,
I'M TELLING YOU.

37:13.540 --> 37:16.873
HAM AND CHEESE, NO LETTUCE,
NO MAYO, NO MUSTARD.

37:16.990 --> 37:18.503
CUT OFF THE CRUSTS,
SLICED IT DIAGONALLY,

37:18.610 --> 37:20.953
JUST HOW YOU LIKE IT, SIR.

37:21.060 --> 37:22.266
I WON'T BE
NEEDING A BAG LUNCH,

37:22.370 --> 37:23.849
BECAUSE I WON'T BE EATING LUNCH
AT THAT SCHOOL.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.474
MAX, THIS IS THE FIRST DAY
OF CHAMBERS ACADEMY.

37:26.580 --> 37:27.854
I KNOW.
GOOD LUCK.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.404
BUDDY.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.135
YEAH, I KNOW.
MOM ALREADY TOLD ME.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.377
IT'S GOING TO BE
A WONDERFUL SCHOOL,

37:32.490 --> 37:33.752
AND I WILL NEED
TO GIVE IT A TRY.

37:33.870 --> 37:37.829
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.009
I JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU

37:39.110 --> 37:41.419
THAT YOUR MOTHER WORKED HER BUTT
OFF THESE LAST EIGHT MONTHS

37:41.530 --> 37:43.282
MAKING THIS SCHOOL HAPPEN,
AND SHE HAD TO GO THROUGH A LOT.

37:43.390 --> 37:44.322
SHE HAD TO MEET
WITH THE DISTRICT.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.215
SHE HAD TO GO
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.251
BOB LITTLE IS A JERK.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.635
HE IS,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,

37:48.740 --> 37:50.981
YOUR MOTHER CONVINCED THAT JERK
TO MAKE THIS SCHOOL HAPPEN.

37:51.090 --> 37:52.955
SHE RECRUITED 39 STUDENTS.

37:53.060 --> 37:54.709
- 38 STUDENTS.
- 39.

37:54.820 --> 37:57.027
38 STUDENTS, I'M NOT A STUDENT
AT CHAMBERS ACADEMY.

37:57.130 --> 37:59.166
[sighs]
ALL RIGHT, MAX, LISTEN.

37:59.270 --> 38:00.749
YOUR MOM SPENT
EVERY OUNCE OF HER ENERGY

38:00.860 --> 38:02.748
WHEN SHE WASN'T TAKING CARE
OF YOU OR YOUR SISTER,

38:02.860 --> 38:06.796
MAKING THIS DREAM HAPPEN
FOR YOU AND OTHER KIDS LIKE YOU.

38:06.900 --> 38:08.868
DO YOU GET THAT?

38:08.970 --> 38:09.868
THIS SCHOOL ISN'T FOR ME.

38:09.970 --> 38:11.244
PUT YOUR SHOES ON.

38:11.350 --> 38:12.692
PACK YOUR BOOK BAG.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.358
YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.803
NOT FOR YOU,
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.746
ALCATRAZ. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD
OUTING.

38:32.860 --> 38:33.679
YEAH.

38:33.790 --> 38:36.543
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
SHE HATED IT.

38:36.650 --> 38:37.856
I DON'T KNOW,
SHE MIGHT HAVE HATED IT, BUT--

38:37.970 --> 38:39.278
HARD TO TELL, RIGHT?

38:39.380 --> 38:41.610
LOOK, NOBODY DIED,
SO IT WAS--

38:41.730 --> 38:42.958
- NOBODY DIED?
- YEAH.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.310
[laughs]

38:44.420 --> 38:45.830
GOOD JOB.
YOU'RE A GOOD DAD.

38:45.940 --> 38:49.103
NOT REALLY, NO,
BUT I'M TRYING.

38:49.220 --> 38:50.357
AND NOW SHE'S GONNA BE HERE.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.666
OH, THAT'S WHAT
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

38:51.770 --> 38:56.491
SANDY SAID SHE WANTS TO DO
50/50 CUSTODY NOW.

38:56.610 --> 38:58.464
- RUBY WILL BE HERE--
- WAIT, WHAT?

38:58.570 --> 39:00.538
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
- WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

39:00.640 --> 39:02.119
- YEAH, I DIDN'T TELL YOU.
- WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

39:02.230 --> 39:04.050
- YEAH, I MEAN, SANDY...
- OH, MY GOSH.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.195
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S HAVING TROUBLE.

39:05.300 --> 39:10.374
SO SHE FINALLY AGREED 50/50,
AND SHE NEEDS MY HELP, SO--

39:10.480 --> 39:13.654
THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR RUBY,
I'M SURE.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.489
I MEAN,
YOU'RE COOL WITH IT, RIGHT?

39:15.590 --> 39:17.581
OH, YES.
I'M SORRY, JUST SURPRISED.

39:17.700 --> 39:21.079
YES, I--
THAT'S GREAT FOR RUBY

39:21.180 --> 39:24.456
AND GREAT FOR YOU
AND--AND ME.

39:24.560 --> 39:28.075
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE--

39:28.190 --> 39:28.975
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

39:29.090 --> 39:30.910
YEAH.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.874
LITTLE BIT OF JELLY.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.878
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN MY
PATIENTS HIT THE GROUND, ZEEK.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.686
I DON'T EVER WANT YOUR CRANIUM
MEETING CONCRETE, OKAY?

39:50.280 --> 39:51.372
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW

39:51.490 --> 39:53.412
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
TO CAUSE YOUR COLLAPSE,

39:53.520 --> 39:56.523
AND I REALLY
DON'T LIKE NOT KNOWING.

39:56.630 --> 39:59.690
SO I THINK
WE SHOULD FIND OUT.

39:59.810 --> 40:02.699
I WANT TO GO IN THERE,
JUST WITH A SCOPE,

40:02.810 --> 40:04.846
TAKE A LOOK,
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

40:04.950 --> 40:07.635
IF THERE'S BLOCKAGES,
WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT.

40:07.750 --> 40:09.775
IF THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS,
WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT TOO.

40:09.890 --> 40:11.846
[voice fades]

40:11.960 --> 40:12.506
HEY, HEART

40:12.610 --> 40:15.477
HAVE A GREAT FIRST DAY.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.400
HEY, HEART

40:17.510 --> 40:19.398

40:20.520 --> 40:24.274
HEY, HEART,
ON THE ROAD AGAIN

40:24.380 --> 40:29.408
ON THE HIGHWAY,

40:29.530 --> 40:32.385
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR HEART

40:32.490 --> 40:33.661
IT'S ALIVE

40:33.770 --> 40:38.139
IT'S PUMPING BLOOD

40:38.260 --> 40:39.488
AND IT'S YOUR HEART

40:39.600 --> 40:43.184
MAX BRAVERMAN,
WELCOME TO CHAMBERS ACADEMY.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.507
IT'S PUMPING BLOOD

40:45.610 --> 40:47.919
AND THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD
IS WHISTLING

40:48.030 --> 40:49.884
[whistling]

40:49.990 --> 40:51.264
HEY

40:51.370 --> 40:53.099
OOH OOH OOH

40:53.200 --> 40:55.441

40:55.550 --> 40:58.166
AND IT'S WHISTLING

40:58.280 --> 40:59.998
HEY

41:00.110 --> 41:04.171
OOH OOH OOH

41:04.280 --> 41:06.384

41:06.490 --> 41:08.219
- HOW'S MY GIRL?
- HEY.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.288
COME HERE.
[kissing]

41:10.390 --> 41:11.596
- HI.
- MM, ARE YOU OKAY?

41:11.710 --> 41:12.563
- YEAH.
- YOU FEEL A LITTLE WARM.

41:12.670 --> 41:13.841
JUST A LONG WEEKEND.

41:13.950 --> 41:15.349
OH, MY GOD,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

41:15.470 --> 41:17.222
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN--

41:17.330 --> 41:19.742
THE WHOLE THING WAS CRAZY.

41:19.850 --> 41:22.057
GRANDPA WAS SITTING
NEXT TO ME.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.926
AND THE NEXT MINUTE,
HE WAS ON THE GROUND.

41:26.030 --> 41:27.577
- OH, MY GOD.
- AND THEN THE BOYS CAME.

41:27.690 --> 41:31.683
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN
TO THE DOCTOR IN VEGAS.

41:31.790 --> 41:32.927
AND IT COULD BE NOTHING.

41:33.040 --> 41:36.624
AND BELIEVE ME,
WE PARTIED INTO THE NIGHT,

41:36.730 --> 41:38.311
AND HE SEEMED COMPLETELY FINE.

41:38.420 --> 41:39.557
I MEAN, THEY CALL IT AN EVENT.

41:39.660 --> 41:42.458
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T, LIKE,
AN ACTUAL HEART ATTACK.

41:42.560 --> 41:46.633
BUT IT WASN'T--
WASN'T NOTHING.

41:46.740 --> 41:50.608
HEY,
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.438
I'M PREGNANT.

41:53.540 --> 41:56.361
[gentle music]

41:59.240 --> 42:01.162
OH.

42:01.270 --> 42:03.158
[sighs]

42:44.590 --> 42:46.000
[dog barks]
