00:08.717 --> 00:10.510
(bell ringing)

00:14.556 --> 00:15.724
D'oh!

00:15.807 --> 00:18.101
-(screams)
-(tires screech)

00:32.198 --> 00:34.492
(pounding on door)

00:34.576 --> 00:36.369
Come on, Simpson,
open up.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.620
We know you're in there.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.376
(water dripping)

00:43.460 --> 00:46.463
Hmm... That one.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.756
Someone's in here.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.716
(crying)

00:49.799 --> 00:50.800
No!

00:50.884 --> 00:52.260
No!

00:52.343 --> 00:54.929
Oh, for
the love of...

00:55.013 --> 00:56.222
Boy, I've never seen

00:56.306 --> 00:57.474
a man so desperate
to get out

00:57.557 --> 00:58.975
of five minutes
of calisthenics.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.019
One, two, three, four.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.313
Up, down, three, four.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.981
Up, down, three, four.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.275
This new exercise program
is great.

01:07.358 --> 01:10.153
Yeah. Every muscle in
my body's getting a workout.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.322
Especially my big, fat mouth.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.656
Yeah. Especially
your big, fat...

01:13.740 --> 01:14.908
Oh, wait.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.285
Raise your right hock.
Aerate.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.287
Raise your left hock.
Aerate.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.081
I want to see
more Teddy Roosevelts

01:21.164 --> 01:22.624
and less Franklin Roosevelts.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.043
(groaning)

01:25.126 --> 01:26.252
...Two.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.171
Actually, homer,
that's just one.

01:28.254 --> 01:29.255
See, each pushup
includes

01:29.339 --> 01:31.841
both an up part
and a down part.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.384
D'oh!

01:33.468 --> 01:35.386
Hey, where's Charlie?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.888
How did he get out of this?

01:36.971 --> 01:38.223
He's at home
on disability.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.016
Yeah, he got injured
on the job.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.601
They sent him
home with pay.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.312
It's like a lottery
that rewards stupidity.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.439
Stupidity, eh?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.233
Must hurt self.

01:48.316 --> 01:52.070
Must hurt self.
Must hurt self.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.075
D'oh!

02:00.078 --> 02:02.080
Hmm, probably better
that didn't hit me.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.755
(electircity hums)

02:13.758 --> 02:16.094
-Yes?
-Hello.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.929
May I help you?

02:18.012 --> 02:21.015
Uh... Could you give
me a little push

02:21.099 --> 02:22.100
in the opposite
direction?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.935
Okay.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.147
Thank you.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.065
"Carpal tunnel syndrome"?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.066
No.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.110
"Lumber lung"? No.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.778
"Juggler's despair"? No.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.531
"Achy-breaky pelvis"? No.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.116
I'm never going to be disabled.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.743
I'm sick of being so healthy.

02:40.827 --> 02:41.995
Hey, wait.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.747
"Hyper-obesity.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.292
"If you weigh more
than 300 pounds,

02:47.375 --> 02:50.003
you qualify as disabled."

02:50.086 --> 02:52.130
(fanfare plays)

02:57.260 --> 02:58.720
You can do it, old boy.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.388
Yes, I can.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.268
Yes, yes.
That's the spirit.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.899
If you gain 61 pounds,
they'll let you work at home?

03:10.982 --> 03:12.650
Uh-huh.
That's the deal.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.152
No more exercise program.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.528
No more traffic.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.780
No more blood drives
or charity walks.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.116
Dad, I know we don't
do a lot together

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202
but helping you
gain 61 pounds

03:22.285 --> 03:23.912
is something
I want to be a part of.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.413
-Dad!
-(screams)

03:25.496 --> 03:26.873
I must protest.

03:26.956 --> 03:27.957
You're abusing a program

03:28.041 --> 03:29.584
intended to help
the unfortunate.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.712
I'm not saying
it isn't sleazy, honey,

03:32.795 --> 03:34.547
but try to see it my way.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.424
All my life,
I've been an obese man

03:36.507 --> 03:37.926
trapped inside
a fat man's body.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.677
Have you told Mom
about this?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.638
No, it would only
worry her.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.598
If you want to add
to her worries, go ahead.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.099
I guess I'm just
a little more grateful

03:45.183 --> 03:46.267
for all she's done for us.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.186
-Dad!
-Yes, sweetheart?

03:48.269 --> 03:50.104
Obesity is really
unhealthy.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.814
Any doctor will
tell you that.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.108
Oh, yeah? Well, we'll
just see about that,

03:54.192 --> 03:55.193
little miss smart guy.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.444
(gasps)

03:56.527 --> 03:58.404
My God, that's monstrous.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.615
I've never heard
of anything so negligent.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.451
I'll have no part of it.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.828
Can you recommend
a doctor who will?

04:05.912 --> 04:06.871
Yes.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.706
Hi, everybody.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.500
BOTH: Hi, Dr. Nick.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.086
Now, there are many
options available

04:13.169 --> 04:16.881
for dangerously underweight
individuals like yourself.

04:16.965 --> 04:21.177
I recommend a slow,
steady gorging process

04:21.261 --> 04:23.680
combined with
assal horizontology.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.431
Of course.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.601
You'll want to focus
on the neglected food groups

04:28.685 --> 04:32.272
such as the whipped group,
the congealed group

04:32.355 --> 04:33.898
and the choc-o-tastic.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.276
What can I do to speed
the whole thing up, Doctor?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.986
Be creative.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.281
Instead of making sandwiches
with bread, use Pop-Tarts.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.491
Instead of chewing gum,
chew bacon.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.202
You could brush your
teeth with milk shakes.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.996
Hey, did you go

04:48.079 --> 04:50.164
to Hollywood Upstairs
Medical College, too?

04:50.248 --> 04:53.710
And remember, if you're not sure
about something,

04:53.793 --> 04:56.004
rub it against
a piece of paper.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.214
If the paper turns clear,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.258
it's your window
to weight gain.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.260
Bye-bye, everybody.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.307
Oh, it's a dream
come true, boy.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.725
I can, nay, I must

05:08.808 --> 05:10.727
eat everything
I've always wanted.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.729
Now come on.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.315
Every second I'm out of bed,
I'm burning precious calories.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.399
Now get grabbing.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.872
Eat around
the banana, Dad.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.290
It's just
empty vitamins.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.930
Lucky for you,
this stuff doesn't work.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.229
I don't know.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.773
Fish sandwich.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.857
Are you sure?

06:04.322 --> 06:05.323
Oh!

06:05.406 --> 06:08.242
225? That means
I lost weight.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.577
(clears throat)

06:09.660 --> 06:12.330
Homer,
you're on the towel rack.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.376
Woo-hoo!

06:16.459 --> 06:19.045
Four more pounds,
and my dream comes true.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.214
Working at home.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.221
Here's your lemonade

06:28.304 --> 06:29.847
and here's your beer.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.643
Oh, you're such a vigorous
young go-getter.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.937
When's your next
coffee break?

06:36.020 --> 06:37.730
Anytime I want.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.898
(tiger growl)

06:41.526 --> 06:44.195
(tango music playing)

06:47.407 --> 06:48.741
Oh.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.119
Hey, Flanders, bad day
at the rat races?

06:51.202 --> 06:53.413
Yeah, a crazy guy shot
a bunch of people

06:53.496 --> 06:55.081
and the subway
ran over my hat.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.671
Hey, Lise,
come look at this.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.713
Neat.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.056
-Hello, honey.
-Hi.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.435
Um... There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.812
Did you put on
a little weight this week?

07:17.895 --> 07:19.313
I was going
to surprise you,

07:19.397 --> 07:20.815
but what the heck.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.943
Honey, I'm purposely
gaining 61 pounds

07:24.026 --> 07:25.319
to get on disability.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.446
(gasps)

07:26.529 --> 07:28.281
Have you lost your mind?

07:28.364 --> 07:30.116
Have you thought
about your health

07:30.199 --> 07:31.451
or your appearance?

07:31.534 --> 07:33.244
Oh, so, that's it,
isn't it, Marge?

07:33.327 --> 07:34.620
Looks.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.038
I didn't know you
were so shallow.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.832
Oh, please.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.459
I would love you if you
weighed 1,000 pounds, but...

07:39.542 --> 07:40.460
Beautiful. Good night.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.880
Oh.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.381
I've got 15 minutes
to gain a pound

07:45.465 --> 07:47.133
or I've got to face
another day at work.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.759
Bad news, Dad.
We're out of food.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.887
We're even out of the basic
elements of food.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.473
You ate all the tarragon
and you drank the soy sauce.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.974
I need a miracle.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.985
Ah, honey, that looks
just like a real doughnut.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.155
Dad, it says "Non-toxic."

08:09.238 --> 08:11.324
Well, that's a plus.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.497
Woo hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:17.580 --> 08:18.706
I did it!

08:18.789 --> 08:21.209
Uh, Dad,
towel rack.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.963
(chuckling)

08:26.047 --> 08:27.215
Oh, my.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.345
(Mr. Burns
clearing throat)

08:32.428 --> 08:35.389
I'm pleased to dedicate
this remote work terminal.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.517
It will allow
our safety inspector here

08:37.600 --> 08:39.393
to preform his duties
from home.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.438
And so, excelsior
to you, mister...

08:42.522 --> 08:44.482
What's the name
of this gastropod?

08:44.565 --> 08:47.318
Simpson, sir. One of your
chair-moisteners from sector 7-G.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.319
Yes.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.320
Simpson.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.158
Thank you for your pity.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.535
Mom, are you
ever planning

08:55.618 --> 08:58.204
to step in and put
a stop to this?

08:58.287 --> 08:59.539
Normally, your father's
crackpot schemes

08:59.622 --> 09:00.706
fizzle out as soon as

09:00.790 --> 09:02.375
he finds something
good on TV

09:02.458 --> 09:04.669
but this season, uh...

09:17.682 --> 09:19.767
I'm looking for something
loose and billowy

09:19.850 --> 09:21.894
something comfortable
for my first day of work.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.563
Work, huh?
Let me guess.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.772
Computer programmer?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.524
Computer magazine columnist?

09:26.607 --> 09:27.775
Something with computers.

09:27.858 --> 09:28.818
Well, I use a computer.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.111
What's the connection?

09:30.194 --> 09:31.571
Must be the non-stop
sitting and snacking.

09:31.654 --> 09:35.449
Well, sir, many of our clients
find pants confining

09:35.533 --> 09:37.535
so we offer a range
of alternatives

09:37.618 --> 09:40.997
for the ample gentleman--
Ponchos, muu-muus, capes

09:41.080 --> 09:43.499
jumpsuits, uni-sheets,
muslin body rolls

09:43.583 --> 09:45.459
academic and judicial robes.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.378
I don't want
to look like a weirdo.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.421
I'll just go with a muu-muu.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.555
(alarm ringing)

09:57.638 --> 09:59.557
<i>ANNOUNCER: Arnie Pie-in-the-sky</i>
<i>with the morning commute!</i>

09:59.640 --> 10:01.434
<i>Traffic this morning</i>
<i>is as bad as it gets.</i>

10:01.517 --> 10:03.603
<i>Due to a fire</i>
<i>at the army testing lab</i>

10:03.686 --> 10:04.979
<i>a bunch of escaped</i>
<i>infected monkeys</i>

10:05.062 --> 10:06.939
<i>are roaming the expressway!</i>

10:07.023 --> 10:09.775
<i>Despite the sweltering heat,</i>
<i>don't unroll your windows</i>

10:09.859 --> 10:10.985
<i>'cause those monkeys</i>

10:11.068 --> 10:12.653
<i>seem confused and irritable.</i>

10:12.737 --> 10:14.196
Hee hee hee!

10:14.280 --> 10:16.866
I pity those poor suckers
on the freeway.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.827
Gas, brake, honk.
Gas, brake, honk.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.621
Honk, honk, punch.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.913
Gas, gas, gas.

10:26.584 --> 10:32.298
8:58. First time I've ever
been early for work

10:32.381 --> 10:34.800
except for all those
daylight savings days.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.177
Lousy farmers.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.305
"To start, press any key."

10:39.388 --> 10:40.514
Where's the "Any" Key?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.016
I see "Esc... "

10:42.099 --> 10:43.267
"Ctrl... "

10:43.351 --> 10:44.560
And "Pg-up"

10:44.644 --> 10:47.313
There doesn't seem
to be any "Any" Key.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.149
Whew! All this computer hacking
is making me thirsty.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.567
I think I'll order a Tab.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.862
Whoop!
No time for that now.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.030
The computer's starting.

10:56.113 --> 11:00.534
"Check core temperature.
Yes / no."

11:00.618 --> 11:01.911
Yes.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.538
"Core temperature normal."

11:04.622 --> 11:05.623
Not too shabby.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.834
"Vent radioactive gas?"

11:08.918 --> 11:10.670
N-o.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.506
"Venting prevents ex-plos-ion."

11:13.589 --> 11:15.299
(chuckling)

11:15.383 --> 11:17.510
Ooh, this is hard.
Where's my Tab?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.220
Okay, then, yes.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.388
Vent the stupid gas.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.146
Ah, no!

11:29.230 --> 11:30.690
The corn!

11:30.773 --> 11:33.818
Paul Newman's
going to have my legs broke.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.112
<i>♪ Bart and Lisa </i>
<i>have to go to school ♪</i>

11:36.195 --> 11:38.114
<i>♪ While I get</i>
<i>to stay home ♪</i>

11:38.197 --> 11:39.281
<i>♪ Nyah, nyah, nyah,</i>
<i>nyah, nyah, nyah ♪</i>

11:39.365 --> 11:40.700
I like school.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.701
Why don't you
live with it, then?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.369
I would if I could.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.870
Not me, sister.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.289
When I grow up,
I'm going to be a lardo

11:47.373 --> 11:50.000
on workman's comp,
just like Dad.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.465
I wash myself
with a rag on a stick.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.263
(guttural laughter)

12:02.346 --> 12:03.264
Whoo, whoo, whoo...

12:03.347 --> 12:04.306
Yeow!

12:04.390 --> 12:05.641
Mom?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.184
This whole thing
is really creepy.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.894
Are you sure
you won't talk to Dad?

12:08.978 --> 12:12.189
I'd like to, honey,
but I'm not sure how.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.692
Your father can be
surprisingly sensitive.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.902
Remember when I giggled at
his Sherlock Holmes hat?

12:16.986 --> 12:18.112
He sulked for a week

12:18.195 --> 12:19.905
and then closed
his detective agency.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.782
Maybe you'll have
to hurt his feelings.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.617
The longer he lives
like this, the harder

12:23.701 --> 12:25.077
it'll be to go back.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.705
Hmm, you're right.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.000
Hmm! Maybe if I use
my least-nagging tone of voice.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.585
(softly)
Homer?

12:32.668 --> 12:33.586
Hmm.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.628
(sharply)
Homer?!

12:34.712 --> 12:35.796
(sternly)
Homer?

12:35.880 --> 12:36.797
That's it.
That's the one.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.757
Send him on in.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.301
Dad?

12:40.384 --> 12:41.552
Yes, honey?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.846
Hmm. Mom just
baked a cake.

12:43.929 --> 12:44.847
Ooh!

12:47.475 --> 12:49.643
Homer, we need to have
a serious talk.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.729
You dragged me all the way
from work for that?

12:51.812 --> 12:55.232
Let's quietly and calmly
discuss the pros and cons

12:55.316 --> 12:57.777
of your controversial
plan, shall we?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.028
I--

12:59.111 --> 13:00.613
Con: You're endangering
your health.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.157
Pro: I'm drought
and famine-resistant.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.785
Con: You're setting a bad
example for the children.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.787
Pro:
I don't have to go to work.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.997
Con: You're running
the air conditioner non-stop.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.207
It's freezing in here.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.375
Pro: Uh...

13:13.459 --> 13:15.586
Uh... I love you?

13:15.669 --> 13:18.839
Con:
I'm finding myself

13:18.923 --> 13:21.091
less attracted
to you physically.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.139
Marge, this is everything
I've ever dreamed of right here

13:27.223 --> 13:29.683
and nobody's going
to take it away from me.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.811
You never had
faith in me before

13:31.894 --> 13:36.816
but let me tell you, the slim,
lazy homer you knew is dead.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.401
Now I'm a big, fat dynamo

13:39.485 --> 13:41.529
and where's that cake?!

13:41.612 --> 13:42.655
There's no cake.

13:42.738 --> 13:43.656
Oh.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.827
"Vent radioactive gas?"

13:47.910 --> 13:49.411
Y-e-s.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.455
"Sound alertness horn?"

13:51.539 --> 13:52.498
Y-e-s.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.666
(horn blowing)

13:53.749 --> 13:55.709
"Decalcify calcium ducts?"

13:55.793 --> 13:57.837
Well, give me a word.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.964
Give me a... Hey.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.675
All I have to type is "Y."

14:02.758 --> 14:05.469
Hey, miss doesn't-find-me-
attractive-sexually-anymore

14:05.553 --> 14:08.514
I just tripled
my productivity.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.266
Good. Good for you.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.851
"Y." "Y".

14:11.934 --> 14:14.228
Let's see, so many letters
to choose from.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.688
I'll pick "Y."

14:15.771 --> 14:18.858
"Y." "Y."

14:18.941 --> 14:21.735
What? What the heck
are you doing over there?

14:21.819 --> 14:22.862
(groaning)

14:22.945 --> 14:23.821
There. You found the floor.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.699
"Y, y, y, y."

14:26.782 --> 14:28.784
"Y, y... "

14:28.868 --> 14:29.827
I'm going out.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.871
I run errands
during the day.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.497
Could you pick me up
a lemonade and a beer?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.707
(door slamming)

14:40.462 --> 14:41.380
(mail slot clatters)

14:41.463 --> 14:43.340
The mail. The mail is here!

14:43.424 --> 14:47.720
Ooh! "An urgent plea
from Edward James Olmos."

14:47.803 --> 14:50.222
"Lisa Simpson,
can you afford to miss

14:50.306 --> 14:52.516
another issue
of the Utne Reader?"

14:54.435 --> 14:55.936
Kids.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.188
Free sample
of fabric softener?

14:58.272 --> 14:59.148
Woo-hoo!

15:02.651 --> 15:03.736
(dryer buzzes)

15:05.529 --> 15:06.739
Mmm.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.199
I can feel three
kinds of softness.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.243
Dad, what are you
doing down there?

15:11.327 --> 15:14.371
Washing
my fat-guy hat, honey.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.791
<i>ANNOUNCER: We now return</i>
<i>to search for the sun.</i>

15:17.875 --> 15:20.252
<i>According to daddy's will,</i>

15:20.336 --> 15:23.547
<i>I inherit</i>
<i>the entire plantation.</i>

15:23.631 --> 15:26.675
<i>I'll see to it</i>
<i>you don't get apricot one.</i>

15:26.759 --> 15:27.885
(computer beeps)

15:32.431 --> 15:35.351
Uh, what's your
Dad's job again?

15:35.434 --> 15:38.145
He's a nuclear
safety technician.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.606
What's he doing
with that broom?

15:40.689 --> 15:42.650
Uh, what isn't he doing?

15:42.733 --> 15:46.528
I heard that guy's ass
has its own congressman.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.155
(guffawing)

15:48.238 --> 15:50.407
Hey, leave my dad alone.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.785
Just because he's overweight
doesn't mean he's bad.

15:52.868 --> 15:56.121
He's a sweet man,
and he has real feelings.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.247
Hey, what are you
kids looking at?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.582
Hey, look.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.376
He's trying to get up
to yell at us.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.294
Don't make me
close that shade.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.338
(groaning)

16:06.423 --> 16:08.258
Hey, Homer,
you promised Mom

16:08.342 --> 16:09.635
you wouldn't wear
your dress outside.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.304
Nuts to that.
I'm going to the movies.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.597
Shouldn't you be working?

16:13.681 --> 16:14.848
I got someone
to cover for me.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.143
(beeps)

16:22.064 --> 16:23.107
One for honk, please.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.484
Oh, gee, uh,
just a minute.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.736
I have to check
with the manager.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.116
That overweight guy
wants to see the movie.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.702
I'm terribly sorry, sir

16:34.785 --> 16:36.036
but I'm afraid
our facilities

16:36.120 --> 16:37.496
are not equipped
to meet your needs.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.415
What are you talking about?

16:39.498 --> 16:41.375
What I'm saying, sir,
is that a man of your carriage

16:41.458 --> 16:43.127
couldn't possibly
fit in our seats.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.712
I could sit
in the aisle.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.922
I'm afraid that would
violate the fire code.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.675
MAN: Hey, fatty,
I got a movie for you--

16:49.758 --> 16:51.552
A Fridge Too Far.

16:51.635 --> 16:52.970
(laughing)

16:54.555 --> 16:55.681
Shame on all of you.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.474
Give me my dignity.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.935
I just came here to see
"Honk if You're Horny" in peace.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.020
Sir, if you
just quiet down,

17:01.103 --> 17:02.104
I'd be happy
to treat you

17:02.187 --> 17:04.023
to a garbage bag
full of popcorn.

17:04.106 --> 17:08.235
This may surprise you, but you
can't buy me off with food.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.863
I'm sick of all your
stereotypes and cheap jokes.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.906
The overweight individuals
in this country

17:12.990 --> 17:15.075
are just as smart and talented

17:15.159 --> 17:16.744
and hardworking
as everybody else

17:16.827 --> 17:18.704
and they're going to make
their voices heard.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.372
All they need is a leader.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.249
Huh!

17:22.332 --> 17:24.293
I'll work harder than ever
before and show the world

17:24.376 --> 17:25.669
overweight people aren't

17:25.753 --> 17:28.714
undisciplined,
lazy and irresponsible.

17:28.797 --> 17:29.965
What happened to my bird?

17:32.926 --> 17:35.846
Oh. Marge?

17:35.929 --> 17:37.681
Lisa?

17:37.765 --> 17:39.308
Flanders?

17:43.854 --> 17:46.482
"Explosion imminent"!

17:46.565 --> 17:48.650
Oh, my God!

17:48.734 --> 17:50.360
The plant's going to explode!

17:50.444 --> 17:52.780
(metal rattling and groaning)

17:52.863 --> 17:55.324
Hey, that thing's going
kah-kah koo-koo.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.950
Who cares?
It's Homer's problem.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.285
Wait. I know.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.162
"Vent gas."

18:00.245 --> 18:01.789
"Pressure too high"?

18:01.872 --> 18:03.123
Oh!

18:03.207 --> 18:04.917
"Tank must be
shut down manually"?!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.919
Oh, stupid bird!

18:07.002 --> 18:09.171
I never should have
put you in charge.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.130
Why, you--

18:11.465 --> 18:12.591
Oh, who am I kidding?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.093
It's all my fault.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.137
I got to call the plant
and warn them.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.685
<i>OPERATOR: The fingers you</i>
<i>have used to dial are too fat.</i>

18:23.769 --> 18:25.521
<i>To obtain</i>
<i>a special dialing wand</i>

18:25.604 --> 18:28.148
<i>please mash the keypad</i>
<i>with your palm now.</i>

18:28.232 --> 18:29.775
(shrill shriek)

18:29.858 --> 18:31.151
(labored breathing)

18:31.235 --> 18:32.861
I'm going to have
to shut it down myself.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.905
Fat don't fail me now!

18:34.988 --> 18:36.073
D'oh!

18:37.449 --> 18:38.367
Oh!

18:43.455 --> 18:45.374
Hey, buddy, you gonna
slow your car down and let me in

18:45.457 --> 18:46.959
because I'm a big, fat guy
and I can't go anywhere

18:47.042 --> 18:48.418
because there's going to be
some poison gas.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.003
I mean it's gonna
be really poisonous!

18:50.087 --> 18:52.047
Everybody's going to be dead,
especially me!

18:54.716 --> 18:55.843
The ice cream man!

18:57.469 --> 18:59.388
Hey, buddy, you got
to let me in your car!

18:59.471 --> 19:01.348
T-take anything you want,
man, take it all!

19:01.431 --> 19:02.558
(babbling)

19:05.144 --> 19:06.812
Push out the jive.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.313
Bring in the love.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.653
I heard your dad
went into a restaurant

19:14.736 --> 19:16.405
and ate everything
in the restaurant

19:16.488 --> 19:18.407
and they had to close
the restaurant.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.576
Hey! My dad may have gained
a little weight

19:20.659 --> 19:23.537
but he's not some kind
of food-crazed maniac!

19:24.872 --> 19:26.290
Oh, that's
raspberry.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.833
(groans)
Oh!

19:30.961 --> 19:33.380
-Ice cream!
-Ice cream!

19:33.463 --> 19:35.716
Workers, please.
There will be time

19:35.799 --> 19:37.176
for the frozen
pudding wagon later.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.220
You still owe me
ten more Iroquois twists.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.514
<i>♪ Ten, hi-yi-ya ♪</i>

19:42.598 --> 19:45.475
<i>♪ And nine, hi-yi-ya ♪</i>

19:48.020 --> 19:49.354
Get away, damn it!

19:49.438 --> 19:50.522
Run for your lives!

19:50.606 --> 19:51.815
I'll take
a rocket pop!

19:51.899 --> 19:53.483
What can I get
for 30 cents?

19:53.567 --> 19:54.484
Let go!

19:54.568 --> 19:56.403
I got to get to the tank!

20:01.533 --> 20:03.493
Heck, I can't decide
without the pictures.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.454

20:36.610 --> 20:38.237

20:43.367 --> 20:44.868
Wait a minute.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.287
There's probably a...

(screams)

20:53.001 --> 20:55.212
Homer, your bravery
and quick thinking

20:55.295 --> 20:57.589
have turned
a potential Chernobyl

20:57.673 --> 20:59.633
into a mere
Three-Mile Island.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.510
Bravo!

21:03.303 --> 21:05.681
I think it's ironic that
Dad saved the day

21:05.764 --> 21:08.350
while a slimmer man would
have fallen to his death.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.727
And I think it's ironic that,
for once, Dad's butt

21:10.811 --> 21:11.895
prevented the release
of toxic gas.

21:11.979 --> 21:12.980
Bart!

21:13.063 --> 21:14.731
We'll have you
out of there

21:14.815 --> 21:17.109
as soon as our tech boys
get you decontaminated.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.945
(laughs)
Thank you, Mr. Burns.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.905
It was pretty scary
up there...

21:21.989 --> 21:23.532

21:23.615 --> 21:25.617
For a while,
I feared for my life!

21:27.494 --> 21:28.996
Oh! Stop!

21:29.079 --> 21:31.248
Now, Homer,
if there's anything else

21:31.331 --> 21:34.167
I can do for you, please
don't hesitate to ask.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.801
Mr. Burns, can you
make me thin again?

21:42.884 --> 21:44.511
I guarantee it.

21:45.762 --> 21:46.847
One.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.849
One.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.350
One!

21:50.434 --> 21:53.186
Bah! I'll just pay
