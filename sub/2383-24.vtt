00:00.790 --> 00:04.191
<i>Kids, in the spring of 2011,</i>
<i>Zoey and I broke up.</i>

00:04.208 --> 00:05.509
<i>But the good news:</i>

00:05.510 --> 00:06.810
<i>Goliath National Bank</i>

00:06.811 --> 00:09.212
<i>was finally ready</i>
<i>to demolish The Arcadian</i>

00:09.213 --> 00:11.248
and build the new headquarters
<i>I'd designed for them.</i>

00:11.249 --> 00:12.966
Ho!

00:12.967 --> 00:15.385
<i>The only problem was--</i>
<i>I kept butting heads</i>

00:15.386 --> 00:18.455
<i>with my project supervisor</i>
<i>on one very important issue.</i>

00:18.456 --> 00:20.524
I want to press the button
to blow up The Arcadian!

00:20.525 --> 00:22.326
I want to press it!
I want to press it!

00:22.327 --> 00:23.560
I want to press it!

00:23.561 --> 00:25.062
Guys, I dated
you both,

00:25.063 --> 00:26.763
and neither of you
is good at pressing

00:26.764 --> 00:28.732
or even finding
the button.

00:28.733 --> 00:29.933
After some awkward
pawing around,

00:29.934 --> 00:31.785
that building's going
to fake an implosion,

00:31.786 --> 00:35.005
say, "Baby, that was great""
and go to sleep.

00:35.673 --> 00:37.541
She means you.
She means you.

00:37.542 --> 00:39.293
I want to press it.
I want to press it!

00:39.294 --> 00:41.078
I'm gonna press it!
I'm gonna press it!

00:41.079 --> 00:42.646
It's just a button, okay?

00:42.647 --> 00:44.715
Can we just talk about
something else, please?

00:45.883 --> 00:48.485
Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.

00:48.486 --> 00:49.720
Oh.
Oh.

00:49.721 --> 00:51.622
That's the first time
since the breakup.

00:51.623 --> 00:53.290
How's she doing?

00:53.291 --> 00:54.725
I'm still unemployed,

00:54.726 --> 00:56.727
so I had to get
a couple roommates.

00:56.728 --> 00:59.846
Saving money.
Making new friends.

00:59.847 --> 01:01.498
No downside.

01:01.499 --> 01:02.933
They're all 22 and sell drugs.

01:02.934 --> 01:05.235
Which means they're
not taking them.

01:05.236 --> 01:08.271
So, that's a win.

01:09.107 --> 01:10.640
Well, I can tell
you're really busy

01:10.641 --> 01:12.826
so I should...
I'll let you go.

01:12.827 --> 01:14.578
Hey.

01:14.579 --> 01:16.530
You want to get coffee
sometime?

01:16.531 --> 01:19.282
You know that "coffee" is code for
"I want to get back together" right?

01:19.283 --> 01:20.584
Well, at first I wasn't sure,

01:20.585 --> 01:23.253
but then she said something
that got me thinking.

01:23.254 --> 01:24.688
I want to get back together.

01:24.689 --> 01:26.490
Oh!
Oh!

01:26.491 --> 01:27.791
Don't worry, we're not.

01:27.792 --> 01:29.726
I just, I feel bad Zoey's
having such a hard time.

01:29.727 --> 01:33.630
You know what might...
make you feel better, buddy?

01:33.631 --> 01:34.865
I'm not letting you
press the button.

01:34.866 --> 01:36.233
I want to press
the button!

01:36.234 --> 01:37.768
You're not pressing the
button! It's my button!

01:37.769 --> 01:39.469
<i>Sadly, that's all you need</i>
<i>to know about my summer.</i>

01:39.470 --> 01:41.471
<i>Now, around this time,</i>
<i>Uncle Marshall</i>

01:41.472 --> 01:44.007
<i>was still having a tough time</i>
<i>finding a job.</i>

01:44.008 --> 01:45.876
He's out printing out a
whole new batch of résumés

01:45.877 --> 01:48.645
because he misspelled the phrase
"detail-oriented."

01:48.646 --> 01:50.564
And when he gets back home,

01:50.565 --> 01:52.349
he is going to find
his favorite soup

01:52.350 --> 01:53.383
there waiting for him.

01:53.384 --> 01:55.485
Oh, that's sweet, Lil,

01:55.486 --> 01:57.571
but didn't you guys get
food poisoning here one time?

01:58.456 --> 01:59.823
Three times.

01:59.824 --> 02:01.525
But they're really nice
about it.

02:01.526 --> 02:05.095
Their policy is, "Get sick,
get a free gallon of soup""

02:08.966 --> 02:12.302
<i>And so, Lily dropped off</i>
<i>Marshall's surprise soup</i>

02:12.303 --> 02:13.536
<i>and headed back to work</i>

02:13.537 --> 02:16.173
to introduce the new class pet.

02:16.174 --> 02:18.108
This is Mr. Buttons 2.

02:18.109 --> 02:19.443
Now, after
what happened

02:19.444 --> 02:23.013
to Mr. Buttons 1,
we have to be very gentle

02:23.014 --> 02:25.182
with...

02:30.688 --> 02:31.905
Marshall!

03:07.992 --> 03:10.527
Don't eat the soup!

03:11.779 --> 03:14.498
Oh, thank God.

03:14.499 --> 03:17.667
This was about to be
my third bowl.

03:18.803 --> 03:20.971
Why shouldn't I eat the soup?

03:26.144 --> 03:29.646
Why shouldn't I eat the soup?

Hey, Mr. Architect,

03:43.928 --> 03:45.896
big day for you
tomorrow, huh?

03:45.897 --> 03:49.399
Yeah. Getting to stand next
to me while I press the button.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.853
That is going to be legend...--
wait for it-- ...dary adjacent.

03:52.854 --> 03:56.373
Legendary adjacent!

03:56.374 --> 03:58.074
You okay?

03:58.075 --> 04:00.243
Yeah... no.

04:00.244 --> 04:03.180
This morning I was
talking to the foreman.

04:03.181 --> 04:05.198
Hey, hotshot.

04:05.199 --> 04:07.918
You know, Rod, um, I'm
loving that nickname,

04:07.919 --> 04:08.818
and I can tell

04:08.819 --> 04:10.653
it's totally affectionate,

04:10.654 --> 04:13.123
but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.

04:13.124 --> 04:16.159
Yeah, but you're
such a hotshot,

04:16.160 --> 04:18.495
I figured I'd just
call you hotshot.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.514
Pick one.

04:20.515 --> 04:22.199
And make sure you like it.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.184
There's going to be
50,000 of these

04:24.185 --> 04:26.870
in your big, hotshot
building, hotshot.

04:26.871 --> 04:30.307
50,000 lightbulbs!

04:30.308 --> 04:31.875
What if this one's too bright?

04:31.876 --> 04:33.443
What if this one flickers

04:33.444 --> 04:35.145
and gives everyone
a weird headache?

04:35.146 --> 04:36.947
Do you know
how many people

04:36.948 --> 04:38.982
it takes to change
50,000 lightbulbs?

04:38.983 --> 04:40.684
Are these people Irish,
Polish, blondes--

04:40.685 --> 04:42.152
what are we dealing with here?

04:42.153 --> 04:44.554
There's just-- there's so
many decisions to be made.

04:44.555 --> 04:45.755
What if I make all
the wrong ones

04:45.756 --> 04:47.357
and my building
just sucks?

04:47.358 --> 04:48.325
Not possible.

04:48.326 --> 04:49.743
Your building is new.

04:49.744 --> 04:53.697
And I have one rule:
New is always better.

04:53.698 --> 04:55.098
You can't keep saying
you have one rule

04:55.099 --> 04:56.433
if they're always
different rules.

04:56.434 --> 04:59.536
Ah, but "new is always better"
is my oldest rule,

04:59.537 --> 05:01.438
which makes it the best.

05:02.340 --> 05:04.007
Hi, Marsh.
Oh, hey, buddy.

05:04.008 --> 05:05.408
Hey.

05:05.409 --> 05:06.676
Everything okay?

05:06.677 --> 05:09.412
Lily got food poisoning
from some soup.

05:10.448 --> 05:11.781
And then I ate the soup

05:11.782 --> 05:13.250
exactly three hours later.

05:13.251 --> 05:18.555
Which means I can see exactly
three hours into my future, and

05:18.556 --> 05:23.693
it... doesn't... look... good.

05:23.694 --> 05:25.862
<i>I tried to be supportive.</i>

05:25.863 --> 05:28.498
Oh, baby, can you
just hold me, please?

05:28.499 --> 05:30.500
Of course, baby.

05:34.438 --> 05:36.139
<i>But it doesn't help it</i>
<i>that when Lily gets going;</i>

05:36.140 --> 05:38.908
she sounds like a velociraptor
<i>from</i> Jurassic Park.

05:42.813 --> 05:45.548
<i>But then I realized</i>

05:45.549 --> 05:48.418
<i>a man can do a lot of living</i>
<i>in three hours.</i>

05:48.419 --> 05:53.923
So, I'm out experiencing this
beautiful, crazy dance called life.

05:53.924 --> 05:55.058
Ah, my last meal.

05:55.059 --> 05:58.395
MacClaren's famous
jalapeño poppers.

05:58.396 --> 05:59.562
My doctor says

05:59.563 --> 06:01.398
I need to eat healthier,
so I figured

06:01.399 --> 06:03.483
the round-trip flight
these babies are about to take

06:03.484 --> 06:06.169
will land them permanently
on the no-fry list.

06:07.104 --> 06:08.872
Good-bye, my friend.

06:10.241 --> 06:12.609
It's been a hell of a ride.

06:14.328 --> 06:15.829
I have to...

06:19.016 --> 06:20.383
Hey, babe.

06:20.384 --> 06:23.286
The gang says
feel better.

06:23.287 --> 06:25.588
Mm. Thanks. Wait,

06:25.589 --> 06:28.692
you didn't tell them
I had food poisoning, did you?

06:28.693 --> 06:30.260
Um, I...

06:30.261 --> 06:32.562
Marshall,
when it's stomach stuff,

06:32.563 --> 06:34.130
you just say
"under the weather,"

06:34.131 --> 06:37.067
or people start picturing you
doing unspeakable things.

06:37.068 --> 06:38.268
I know.

06:38.269 --> 06:40.804
I just said that
you had the sniffles.

06:40.805 --> 06:43.823
No one is picturing
anything but little

06:43.824 --> 06:45.241
red-nosed you

06:45.242 --> 06:47.544
under a blankie
with some hot tea.

06:47.545 --> 06:50.480
I wonder what end it's coming
out of Lily right now.

06:50.481 --> 06:52.382
I bet it's her tushie.

06:52.383 --> 06:54.117
I bet it's both.

06:58.155 --> 07:00.924
Hey, speaking of explosions--

07:00.925 --> 07:01.992
enough already, Ted!

07:01.993 --> 07:03.293
That button's mine!

07:03.294 --> 07:04.894
Yeah, fine, okay.

07:04.895 --> 07:06.529
I got you this job, so I...

07:06.530 --> 07:07.530
Say what?

07:07.531 --> 07:08.848
Whatever.

07:08.849 --> 07:10.300
It's yours.

07:10.301 --> 07:11.634
I gotta run.

07:11.635 --> 07:13.169
You...

07:16.507 --> 07:17.841
Hello?

07:17.842 --> 07:19.743
Yes, it is.

07:20.695 --> 07:22.846
It's Bloom, Greenberg
and Associates.

07:22.847 --> 07:23.713
They want me to come interview.

07:25.449 --> 07:28.385
Yes, I know it's risky to go,
but this is the best

07:28.386 --> 07:29.886
environmental law firm
in New York.

07:29.887 --> 07:30.887
It's my dream job.

07:32.689 --> 07:34.690
That's a great idea, babe.

07:34.691 --> 07:36.209
I'll ask them.

07:36.210 --> 07:39.896
Hey, is it at all possible,
could I come in on Monday?

07:40.898 --> 07:43.299
Okay, I'll, I'll see you
at 5:00.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.501
Thank you.

07:48.539 --> 07:52.359
I love and believe in you, too,
baby.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.010
Why would Ted

07:54.011 --> 07:55.845
just give up the button
like that?

07:57.214 --> 07:59.616
And he forgot his phone.

07:59.617 --> 08:01.985
"See you in an hour."

08:01.986 --> 08:02.685
Who's that from?

08:02.686 --> 08:03.686
Zoey.

08:03.687 --> 08:05.622
They're meeting for coffee.

08:05.623 --> 08:08.892
Ted's getting back together
with her!

08:12.982 --> 08:15.683
Why would Ted get back together
with Zoey? He's doing great.

08:15.858 --> 08:17.992
After a breakup,
we all think we're doing great.

08:17.993 --> 08:21.173
Sometimes the tiniest trigger
can unravel you and send

08:21.182 --> 08:23.217
you crawling right back.
No,

08:23.232 --> 08:25.533
I refuse to believe that Ted
is getting back with Zoey

08:25.534 --> 08:26.568
because of lightbulbs.

08:26.569 --> 08:28.553
Uh, Ted's gone back for less.

08:32.508 --> 08:34.025
Hi, Natalie.

08:34.025 --> 08:36.211
You want to get coffee sometime?

08:40.232 --> 08:41.249
Bro.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.885
Ted, I only have one rule.

08:43.885 --> 08:46.921
But I can't reach
the worst part.

08:47.823 --> 08:49.190
Hi, Karen.

08:49.191 --> 08:51.359
Want to get coffee sometime?

08:52.628 --> 08:55.196
TV ANNOUNCER:
Coming up next,
our two local pandas,

08:55.197 --> 08:57.766
Ming Ming and Bao Bao,
are expecting a baby.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.200
Robin, you want to get coffee

08:59.201 --> 09:01.219
sometime...?

09:01.220 --> 09:03.505
Get it together, bro.

09:03.506 --> 09:05.273
According
to my calculations,

09:05.274 --> 09:06.641
at 6:00 p.m.,

09:06.642 --> 09:08.576
my body is gonna pay out

09:08.577 --> 09:11.179
like the most disgusting
slot machine in the world.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.815
That gives me two hours
to go do the interview

09:13.816 --> 09:15.350
and still get back in time.

09:15.351 --> 09:17.852
Oh, but, baby, what if
you hit the jackpot early?

09:17.853 --> 09:19.721
Don't worry.

09:19.722 --> 09:22.624
I'll be prepared.

09:39.075 --> 09:41.476
I'm talking your ear off, sorry.

09:41.477 --> 09:43.812
Is there anything
I can do for you, sweetie?

09:45.297 --> 09:49.100
Can... I... borrow...

09:49.101 --> 09:51.586
an adult diaper?

09:53.923 --> 09:55.473
We've got to stop Ted.
Where are they meeting?

09:55.474 --> 09:58.660
Okay, Zoey wrote, "Meet me
at 6:00, where it all began,

09:58.661 --> 10:01.096
where you gave me the orchid
at the intersection."

10:01.097 --> 10:03.314
Well, that's good.
All we have to do is think back

10:03.315 --> 10:05.667
to the time Ted told us
about his first date with Zoey.

10:05.668 --> 10:07.669
Amazing first
date with Zoey!

10:07.670 --> 10:09.270
We met at the
intersection.

10:12.441 --> 10:14.843
Aw, that's sweet.

10:14.844 --> 10:16.544
You weren't listening either?

10:16.545 --> 10:17.812
I was in a coma.

10:17.813 --> 10:20.482
I mean, who pays attention
to that sappy romantic crap?

10:20.483 --> 10:22.417
Lily!

10:22.418 --> 10:24.919
Yeah, I wasn't
listening, either.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.622
Ted really can go on
about a bitch.

10:27.623 --> 10:29.891
Great. He could be anywhere.

10:29.892 --> 10:31.459
We're flat out of clues.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.178
Hey, wait. Ted left a message.

10:33.179 --> 10:35.530
I could hear it 'cause
I was in the bathroom...

10:35.531 --> 10:37.632
blowing my nose--
I have the sniffles.

10:39.435 --> 10:41.236
Hey, Lily,
hope you're feeling better.

10:41.237 --> 10:43.471
Marshall told us you're
exploding from both ends

10:43.472 --> 10:45.507
like a busted fire hydrant.

10:45.508 --> 10:46.508
Damn it, Marshall.

10:46.509 --> 10:48.042
Anyway, listen, I was going to

10:48.043 --> 10:50.078
get back together with Zoey
today,

10:50.079 --> 10:52.714
but I came to my senses
on the way out here, so...

10:52.715 --> 10:54.115
False alarm.

10:55.084 --> 10:56.417
Oh, crap.

10:56.418 --> 10:58.253
Just stepped in some gum.

10:58.254 --> 11:00.054
I'm getting back together
with Zoey!

11:01.190 --> 11:02.724
Okay, we're never
gonna find him.

11:02.725 --> 11:04.008
Wait, wait, wait.

11:04.009 --> 11:06.661
That's was a subway announcement
in the background.

11:06.662 --> 11:07.862
I speak conductor.

11:07.863 --> 11:09.330
Hey, Lily, hope
you're feeling better.

11:09.331 --> 11:11.332
Marshall told us...
Got it.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.568
Ted's at...

11:18.390 --> 11:20.608
Oh...

11:21.977 --> 11:23.912
Ted's at Smith
and Ninth Street.

11:23.913 --> 11:25.063
That's the intersection.

11:25.064 --> 11:26.481
That's in Brooklyn. How are we

11:26.482 --> 11:27.682
ever gonna get there in time?

11:27.683 --> 11:29.183
Way ahead of ya.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.821
Hello!

11:34.990 --> 11:38.042
Marshall. Jake Bloom.
Great to meet you.

11:38.043 --> 11:39.160
Hello, hi.

11:39.161 --> 11:41.262
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry
about the stench.

11:41.263 --> 11:43.531
We're suing a factory
that's been dumping raw sewage

11:43.532 --> 11:44.632
into a local marshland.

11:44.633 --> 11:47.368
Yeah, ten minutes ago,
I was knee-deep

11:47.369 --> 11:49.571
in liquefied human feces.

11:49.572 --> 11:52.574
And that was just
on the F train.

11:54.476 --> 11:56.911
I can't believe Ted's getting
back together with Zoey.

11:56.912 --> 11:58.880
I know. They're
a total train wreck.

11:58.881 --> 12:00.181
Unmitigated disaster.

12:00.182 --> 12:01.249
Worst couple ever.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.451
Yeah, almost as bad as us.

12:03.452 --> 12:06.354
We were a mess.

12:07.523 --> 12:10.725
Do you remember how awful
I looked by the end?

12:10.726 --> 12:12.026
My hair was falling out,

12:12.027 --> 12:15.229
my skin was gray,
my back was hunched.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.115
What about me? I got so fat,

12:17.116 --> 12:20.201
at the end of a date,
<i>you'd</i> unhook <i>my</i> bra.

12:20.202 --> 12:23.538
You were the only boyfriend
I ever motorboated.

12:24.974 --> 12:27.008
Thank God we're not
sentimental saps

12:27.009 --> 12:29.244
who panic
and get back together.

12:29.245 --> 12:30.211
Seriously,

12:30.212 --> 12:32.213
why would people do that?

12:34.300 --> 12:36.467
I guess I get it.

12:36.468 --> 12:37.719
What do you mean?

12:37.720 --> 12:42.824
Well, no matter how bad
things got...

12:42.825 --> 12:45.693
Ted really did love Zoey
for a minute there.

12:45.694 --> 12:47.662
Didn't he?

12:51.867 --> 12:54.636
Yeah... he did.

12:55.604 --> 13:00.742
And... she loved him, too.

13:00.743 --> 13:02.744
Didn't she?

13:04.246 --> 13:06.814
Yeah, she did.

13:11.987 --> 13:14.522
Smith and Ninth Street.

13:14.523 --> 13:16.674
So, let me show you some

13:16.675 --> 13:19.093
of the gut-wrenching
environmental atrocities

13:19.094 --> 13:22.597
that we were working
to stop, okay?

13:22.598 --> 13:25.433
Here, pop quiz.

13:25.434 --> 13:27.435
What is that?

13:27.436 --> 13:29.237
That's a seal.

13:29.238 --> 13:32.307
Bingo! Yes, a bloated
seal corpse

13:32.308 --> 13:34.208
rotting in industrial waste.

13:34.209 --> 13:35.410
Mm-hmm.

13:35.411 --> 13:37.378
Now, wait till you see
what we found

13:37.379 --> 13:39.664
when we cut him open.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.917
Okay, where the hell
are they?

13:42.918 --> 13:44.002
Maybe this isn't
the intersection.

13:44.003 --> 13:45.670
Well, maybe it is
and we're too late.

13:45.671 --> 13:47.672
Man, I wish we'd gone
to Brooklyn sooner.

13:47.673 --> 13:49.490
I know, right?

13:49.491 --> 13:51.459
Ever since the Trader Joe's
opened up,

13:51.460 --> 13:53.962
Brooklyn is so... whatever.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.464
Wait. Where'd
you get that?

13:56.465 --> 13:57.765
Across the street

13:57.766 --> 13:59.767
at the Intersection.

14:00.769 --> 14:07.208
So, uh, you guys... want
to buy some weed or...?

14:14.640 --> 14:16.324
She's alone!
There's still time!

14:16.357 --> 14:17.774
But where the
hell is Ted?

14:17.775 --> 14:18.826
Wait a minute.

14:18.827 --> 14:20.944
On their first date,
he brought her an orchid.

14:20.945 --> 14:24.481
How much do you want to bet
he's gonna do it again?

14:24.482 --> 14:25.449
Brilliant. But wait,

14:25.450 --> 14:27.451
he had a huge
head start on us.

14:27.452 --> 14:29.019
There's no way
he's still in there

14:29.020 --> 14:31.121
unless he spent a half an hour
picking out the perfect orchid.

14:31.122 --> 14:32.356
Thanks, Julia!

14:34.159 --> 14:39.463
You know what? Let me see
the pink lady slipper again.

14:40.865 --> 14:43.267
Now, do you know
what that is?

14:43.268 --> 14:46.870
A pile of rotting seagull
carcasses

14:46.871 --> 14:49.706
covered in toxic sludge.

14:49.707 --> 14:52.643
Being eaten by rats. Exactly.

14:52.644 --> 14:54.077
Now this next slide...

14:54.078 --> 14:57.581
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's my wife's water birth.

14:57.582 --> 14:59.950
I don't know how that got
in there.

15:02.453 --> 15:05.656
Anyway, that's all my questions.

15:05.657 --> 15:08.425
<i>Oh, my God, I made it!</i>

15:08.426 --> 15:11.028
<i>Now just shake his hand,</i>
<i>clench your very soul</i>

15:11.029 --> 15:12.362
<i>and run like hell!</i>

15:14.165 --> 15:16.700
Now, I like to set aside
20 minutes at the end

15:16.701 --> 15:18.268
of every interview
for your questions.

15:18.269 --> 15:19.570
So don't hold back.

15:19.571 --> 15:22.339
Whatever you got inside there,
you just let 'er rip.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.175
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

15:25.176 --> 15:27.678
<i>I'm just gonna tell him</i>
<i>the truth.</i>

15:28.479 --> 15:30.214
When it's stomach stuff,

15:30.215 --> 15:31.848
you just say
"under the weather"

15:31.849 --> 15:35.385
or people start picturing you
doing unspeakable things.

15:35.386 --> 15:38.855
I have food poisoning and I'm
about to start volcanoing

15:38.856 --> 15:41.225
toxic sludge out of both ends!

15:41.226 --> 15:42.526
Nailed it.

15:45.263 --> 15:47.531
Thanks, Julia!

15:50.034 --> 15:51.101
No, on second thought.

15:52.971 --> 15:55.622
Ooh! Come on.
What the hell?!

15:55.623 --> 15:57.174
You can't get back together
with Zoey just because

15:57.175 --> 15:58.342
you're freaking out
over a lightbulb.

15:58.343 --> 16:00.510
I'm not freaking out
over a lightbulb!

16:00.511 --> 16:03.096
I'm freaking out over
50,000 lightbulbs!

16:03.097 --> 16:05.082
I can't do this!

16:05.083 --> 16:07.718
I only got this job because
you gave it to me, Barney.

16:07.719 --> 16:10.587
I didn't earn it!

16:10.588 --> 16:13.357
Look, Ted, the future is scary.

16:13.358 --> 16:15.726
But you can't just run back
to the past

16:15.727 --> 16:17.661
because it's familiar.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.797
Yes, it's tempting.

16:22.066 --> 16:25.435
But... it's a mistake.

16:28.573 --> 16:29.773
You're right.

16:29.774 --> 16:33.310
Um, excuse me.

16:33.311 --> 16:36.280
Can you give this to the blonde
sitting alone in there

16:36.281 --> 16:39.349
and tell her Ted's really sorry?

16:40.468 --> 16:42.853
Also... indirect sunlight.

16:42.854 --> 16:46.156
Don't overwater. Half a cup
a week is more than enough.

16:58.636 --> 16:59.870
No.

17:01.606 --> 17:02.906
Hi.

17:02.907 --> 17:06.492
<i>And kids...</i>

17:06.493 --> 17:08.645
<i>that's how I met your mother.</i>

17:08.646 --> 17:12.182
Psych. It was just some chick.

17:15.336 --> 17:17.319
Hey, baby, how'd it go?

17:17.320 --> 17:22.025
Lily, this year, this nasty
schoolyard bully of a year

17:22.026 --> 17:24.194
will not stop punching me
in the face.

17:24.194 --> 17:26.797
How did we kick off 2011?

17:26.798 --> 17:28.265
My dad died.

17:28.266 --> 17:30.634
And now after five months
of unemployment,

17:30.635 --> 17:32.202
I just blew my dream job.

17:32.203 --> 17:33.970
The good news is,
in a few seconds,

17:33.971 --> 17:35.739
I'm gonna start heaving
my guts out

17:35.740 --> 17:37.607
because that's what life is
for me now;

17:37.608 --> 17:41.011
just losing what's inside
until I'm just empty.

17:41.012 --> 17:42.479
Baby, come here.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.282
I just want to shut my eyes

17:45.283 --> 17:46.983
for a few seconds
before it starts.

17:57.128 --> 18:00.864
<i>And Marshall slept...</i>

18:02.633 --> 18:04.434
<i>...all night.</i>

18:14.812 --> 18:16.880
Okay, hotshot.

18:16.881 --> 18:18.849
Mr. Stinson.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.518
Who's gonna do the honors?

18:21.519 --> 18:23.754
He is.

18:23.755 --> 18:25.072
You sure?

18:25.073 --> 18:27.758
Yeah. You earned it.

18:29.410 --> 18:31.728
All clear!

18:33.531 --> 18:37.567
Hey, new is
always better, right?

18:37.568 --> 18:39.936
Always.

18:41.506 --> 18:43.573
Ten, nine,

18:43.574 --> 18:44.708
eight...

18:44.709 --> 18:47.611
Lily, it's a miracle.

18:47.612 --> 18:50.580
I didn't get sick.
I didn't get sick.

18:50.581 --> 18:53.967
I know, baby.

18:53.968 --> 18:56.386
I'm pregnant.

19:03.161 --> 19:04.394
...one!

19:17.208 --> 19:22.145
♪ Let it roll across the floor ♪

19:22.146 --> 19:27.918
♪ Through the hall
and out the door ♪

19:27.919 --> 19:30.589
♪ To the fountain of
perpetual birth ♪

19:30.618 --> 19:32.902
I'm proud of you
for giving Ted the button.

19:32.903 --> 19:34.654
It meant a lot.

19:34.655 --> 19:36.389
It's just a button.

19:36.390 --> 19:38.925
Can we talk about
something else, please?

19:45.732 --> 19:47.168
Nora.
Hi.

19:47.188 --> 19:48.455
How you been?

19:48.551 --> 19:50.252
Fine.

19:51.818 --> 19:53.319
Look, I don't
know why

19:53.359 --> 19:57.162
you would possibly say yes
to this, but would you want

19:57.163 --> 19:59.931
to grab a cup of coffee with me
sometime?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.001
20 minutes.
I was such a jerk to you.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.836
You can spend the entire time
calling me

20:04.837 --> 20:06.271
every dirty name in the book.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.839
I speak four languages.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.074
I'm gonna need more
than 20 minutes.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.711
I'll call you.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.680
You look beautiful,
by the way.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.683
And here I thought
it was too late for sundresses.

20:17.742 --> 20:19.910
It's never too late, Barney.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.416
Challenge accepted.

20:38.132 --> 20:39.298
Best man?

20:39.299 --> 20:41.318
You're being summoned.

20:41.319 --> 20:43.169
Geez, what now?

20:46.107 --> 20:48.808
I heard the groom needed me.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.452
What do you think of this tie?
