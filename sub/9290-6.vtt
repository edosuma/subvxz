"Previously on" 24.

00:14.384 --> 00:17.744
Welcome to the first of three
debates between President David Palmer...

00:17.840 --> 00:20.015
and Senator John Keeler.

00:20.111 --> 00:24.463
My office has just learned that the woman with
whom the president is currently involved...

00:24.559 --> 00:26.735
Dr. Anne Packard,
is being accused...

00:26.831 --> 00:30.447
of helping to fabricate the results
of a clinical drug trial.

00:30.543 --> 00:34.607
Did the president know of these accusations
and choose to ignore them?

00:34.703 --> 00:38.415
Your dad's trying to break out
Salazar. When's the last time you heard from him?

00:38.511 --> 00:43.055
About a half hour ago. He asked me
to issue a transfer order for Ramon Salazar.

00:43.151 --> 00:46.287
- And you did it?
- Yeah. He said that Salazar needed to be moved.

00:46.383 --> 00:48.207
But now you're telling me this isn't true?

00:48.303 --> 00:51.471
- No, Kim, I'm sorry. Your dad lied to you.
- What's gonna happen to him?

00:51.567 --> 00:54.286
The best way out of this whole situation
is to find Kyle Singer.

00:54.382 --> 00:56.366
Then your dad will give up Salazar.

00:56.462 --> 00:59.214
Kyle, what are you doing?
There's no way out of here.

00:59.310 --> 01:03.054
If I die, the virus is dying with me.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.830
Kyle!

01:08.941 --> 01:12.238
I got it. A patrol car just found
the truck Kyle Singer was in.

01:12.366 --> 01:14.893
Pipe this into the teams on standby.

01:14.989 --> 01:18.861
Assume everyone on site is contagious
and use level one C.D.C. Protocol.

01:18.957 --> 01:21.870
If you wanna get out of this thing,
you're gonna have to trust me.

01:21.966 --> 01:23.853
- " Chase!"
- " What are you doing, Jack?"

01:23.949 --> 01:27.086
I gotta get Salazar
in the air in that chopper...

01:27.182 --> 01:30.957
in the next 60 seconds
or 100,000 people will die... You choose!

01:31.085 --> 01:34.797
This is Warden Mitchell. I want all teams
to stand down. I repeat, stand down.

01:37.517 --> 01:41.613
Congratulations. Now you are an even
bigger enemy to your country than I am.

01:45.709 --> 01:49.644
The following takes place
between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.

02:00.012 --> 02:03.340
- Do we have enough fuel to get to Mexico?
- We're not going to Mexico.

02:03.468 --> 02:06.732
- What do you mean? Why not?
- If we run for the border,
they'll try and force us down.

02:06.828 --> 02:09.036
You're gonna have to trust me.

02:12.779 --> 02:15.148
- "Field Ops, O'Brian."
- Chloe, it's Chase.

02:15.244 --> 02:18.443
Jack disarmed his locator, but the military
should have him on radar by now.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.356
They're feeding us the stream,
Chase. I'm sending it to you.

02:26.858 --> 02:29.931
He just banked.
He's heading west towards downtown.

02:30.027 --> 02:34.443
Downtown? He knows they can't
shoot him down over a populated area.

02:34.539 --> 02:38.442
We may be able to override what
he did to his comm unit through
an emergency hailing frequency.

02:38.538 --> 02:41.706
We have to get through to him, Chloe.
We gotta let him know we found Kyle Singer.

02:41.802 --> 02:44.586
- On it.
- "Major Blanchard, this is Ryan Chappelle."

02:44.682 --> 02:46.506
What's the status of your pursuit craft?

02:46.602 --> 02:49.642
I have two helicopters that have
just taken off from down here.

02:49.738 --> 02:51.690
How quickly will they intercept?

02:51.786 --> 02:53.610
Well, that's changed.
Bauer just turned.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.946
- "He's no longer heading south toward us."
- Where's he headed?

02:56.041 --> 02:57.866
It looks like he's headed toward the city.

02:57.962 --> 03:01.385
At his current speed, it'll take us
10 minutes before we get within range.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.746
You've gotta force him down.
Even shoot him down, if it comes to that.

03:04.842 --> 03:08.905
But we can't do that while he's over the city
without incurring serious collateral damage.

03:09.001 --> 03:10.825
Then you have to do it
before he gets to the city.

03:10.921 --> 03:13.097
- If he lands, he'll be difficult to catch.
- Yes, sir.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.449
Keep this line open.
Michelle, I'm taking over for Tony.

03:17.545 --> 03:21.609
Division wants a senior officer
in charge of C.T.U. Give me an update.

03:21.705 --> 03:23.529
We're trying to make contact
with the chopper.

03:23.625 --> 03:26.824
Now that we have Kyle Singer and the virus
has been contained, we need to contact Jack...

03:26.920 --> 03:29.705
- let him know that the escape
of Salazar is pointless.
- Okay.

03:29.801 --> 03:33.577
Assemble all the department heads
in the conference area.
I want everyone on the same page.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.009
What about C-band?

03:40.104 --> 03:42.216
A SWATchopper
wouldn't be using those frequencies.

03:42.312 --> 03:46.664
Adam. Tie up whatever you're doing. We have
a briefing in the conference area in two.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.272
Kim.

03:51.368 --> 03:53.192
Over here.

03:54.696 --> 03:57.000
- What do you need?
- I need you to anchor these lists for Chloe...

03:57.096 --> 03:59.815
while she's trying to find
an admitting channel for the chopper.

03:59.911 --> 04:01.799
I'm on it.

04:04.392 --> 04:08.263
- I'm sorry I lost it in your dad's office.
- It's okay.

04:08.359 --> 04:11.175
- Did you tell Michelle about
the drugs you found in there?
- Yeah.

04:11.271 --> 04:14.023
- What are they gonna do?
- I don't know.

04:14.119 --> 04:16.839
Everything came in right after that.
So no one's had time to process.

04:18.726 --> 04:22.599
- "I'm sending over the first two groups."
- Sure.

04:31.270 --> 04:35.014
We'll make every attempt to communicate
with Jack, try to resolve this peacefully.

04:35.110 --> 04:38.917
But if we can't, I need everyone
absolutely clear on this.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.894
Salazar's terrorist connections
are a serious threat to this country.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.549
We cannot let him leave.

04:44.645 --> 04:47.046
Now that we've got Singer,
should it come to it...

04:47.142 --> 04:49.925
both Salazar and Bauer
are expendable.

04:50.021 --> 04:53.797
Why aren't we focusing on other options that
would bring down the chopper without force?

04:53.925 --> 04:57.318
Jack's not giving us any options.
He's on a suicide mission either way.

04:57.414 --> 05:01.061
Once he hands Ramon off to Hector, they'll
have no use for him. They're going to kill him.

05:01.157 --> 05:03.973
I just got off the phone
with Major Blanchard.

05:04.069 --> 05:06.021
He has pursuit craft tracking Jack.

05:06.117 --> 05:10.213
However, if they're not able to catch him
by the time he reaches metro airspace...

05:10.309 --> 05:12.517
then we have a whole
new set of problems.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.397
We need to coordinate
with local authorities now.

05:25.380 --> 05:27.237
Damn it!

05:27.333 --> 05:31.716
- Hector, relax.
- Why can't I reach Gael?

05:31.812 --> 05:33.956
Maybe he can't get away.

05:38.595 --> 05:41.572
I need to know what's
going on with Ramon now.

05:41.668 --> 05:44.707
The government is probably releasing him.
It's just taking some time.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.692
They're not releasing him!

05:51.652 --> 05:54.691
- I didn't want to tell you.
- Tell me what?

05:56.771 --> 06:00.835
The plan has changed. Jack Bauer is
the one who is going to deliver Ramon.

06:02.786 --> 06:06.499
Jack Bauer?
What is that, a joke?

06:08.866 --> 06:11.779
- No.
- Well, how is that possible?

06:11.874 --> 06:15.075
I mean, Ramon would never accept help
from the man who put him in prison.

06:15.171 --> 06:18.370
Oh, no.
He is accepting his help.

06:20.290 --> 06:24.514
Bauer is now a criminal in
his own country for doing this.

06:24.610 --> 06:29.026
Hector, what's going on?
How could you let Bauer come to us?

06:29.122 --> 06:30.786
- That's too dangerous.
- Don't worry, Claudia.

06:30.882 --> 06:33.794
No, I am worried!
Look what he's already done to us.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.906
- Shh!
- It's some kind of trick.

06:36.002 --> 06:39.746
Don't worry about Jack Bauer.
I have plans for him.

06:42.273 --> 06:44.865
Yes.

06:44.962 --> 06:47.105
I don't have a lot of time.
We're in the middle of this.

06:47.201 --> 06:49.793
Is Ramon alive?

06:49.889 --> 06:53.377
Yes. He and Bauer have
escaped in a helicopter.

06:53.473 --> 06:57.057
- Have they contacted our pilot yet?
- No, no. They're being pursued.

06:57.153 --> 06:59.265
Everything will be decided
in the next few minutes.

07:13.024 --> 07:16.096
Hey, what did Chappelle say
in the briefing?

07:18.304 --> 07:20.895
He said a lot of stuff.

07:20.992 --> 07:24.736
- Are they gonna try and shoot down my father?
- If they have to, yeah.

07:26.111 --> 07:28.864
But if they can contact him first,
it won't come to that.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.263
- Chloe, where are you at?
- No progress on the hailing frequency.

07:31.359 --> 07:34.560
- "Without that, we can't get through toJack."
- Here's some new ones to try.

07:34.656 --> 07:37.247
Use a tree search.
We've gotta get through to that chopper.

07:37.343 --> 07:39.232
- " Kim."
- Yeah.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.503
I need to speak to you.

07:41.599 --> 07:43.455
Sure.

07:51.359 --> 07:55.550
Ryan and I feel you shouldn't be here until
the situation with your father is resolved.

07:57.247 --> 07:59.071
I'm qualified to handle the work, Michelle.

07:59.167 --> 08:03.551
Your qualifications aren't at issue.
Your emotions are.

08:03.647 --> 08:06.686
I can control my emotions.

08:06.782 --> 08:09.598
My father's doing this so
that the virus won't get out.

08:09.694 --> 08:11.550
If he knows that
Kyle Singer's in custody...

08:11.646 --> 08:14.461
- he'll give Salazar back.
- I know, but we can't reach your father.

08:14.557 --> 08:17.726
Not yet, but Chloe and Adam are
getting there, and I can help them.

08:19.741 --> 08:21.694
I'm a resource, Michelle.
Don't do this.

08:24.029 --> 08:26.269
Okay. Go back and help Adam.

08:32.284 --> 08:35.613
If we have to fire on that chopper,
I want her out of here.

08:43.580 --> 08:47.293
Hey, what's going on?

08:47.389 --> 08:49.212
- It's military.
- How can you tell?

08:49.308 --> 08:52.093
Their formation, rate of speed. They're
gonna be on us in three to four minutes.

08:52.189 --> 08:56.060
- And then what?
- I assume they've got orders
to shoot us out of the sky.

09:13.627 --> 09:15.644
- "Chappelle."
- I just spoke with someone at C.T.U.

09:15.740 --> 09:17.819
They said you authorized
the use of force against the chopper.

09:17.915 --> 09:19.739
That's right, Chase, I did.

09:19.835 --> 09:23.099
- Does President Palmer know about this?
- Palmer?

09:23.195 --> 09:27.164
First of all, he's in the middle of a national
debate. And I don't need his authorization.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.819
Bauer just helped Ramon Salazar
break out of prison.

09:29.915 --> 09:32.666
He did that to make sure
Salazar's people don't release this virus.

09:32.762 --> 09:35.963
I don't care.
Look, this is my jurisdiction.

09:36.059 --> 09:40.379
All I'm saying is that getting Palmer's
authorization might be the smart play here.

09:40.475 --> 09:43.770
Think about it. Jack Bauer has
a personal relationship with the president.

09:43.866 --> 09:45.691
He's saved his life more than once.

09:45.787 --> 09:48.570
And Palmer has interceded
on his behalf before.

09:48.666 --> 09:53.146
Our mandate does not bend to
accommodate personal relationships.

09:53.242 --> 09:55.066
You're right, Ryan.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.138
And after you shoot Jack down, you can
personally explain that to the president.

10:05.882 --> 10:08.729
Chappelle.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.482
Our aircraft are about to make
visual contact with Bauer.

10:11.578 --> 10:14.009
- We can be ready to fire in...
- Do not fire.

10:14.105 --> 10:18.105
Repeat... do not fire
until you hear back from me.

10:20.825 --> 10:25.145
The president has spoken of
his administration's support
for the American worker.

10:25.241 --> 10:30.169
But I'm sure these words sound hollow
to Armando Rodriguez of Galveston...

10:30.265 --> 10:32.120
Shawnda Brown of Biloxi...

10:32.216 --> 10:34.777
Kendall Taylor of Tampa...

10:34.873 --> 10:38.584
and to a hundred thousand of their
fellow workers who have lost their jobs...

10:38.680 --> 10:42.552
because of trade agreements
signed by President David Palmer.

10:42.648 --> 10:45.912
"It's my belief that"
opportunities have been missed.

10:47.448 --> 10:49.880
- "I believe in the long term, the big picture."
- Wayne Palmer.

10:49.976 --> 10:51.896
Mr. Palmer, Ryan Chappelle calling.

10:51.992 --> 10:55.128
Mr. Chappelle,
what's the latest on the bio-threat?

10:55.224 --> 10:57.944
Kyle Singer, whom we believe
to be the only carrier of the virus...

10:58.040 --> 11:00.120
has been taken into custody.

11:00.216 --> 11:03.000
So you're telling me there is no longer a risk
of this virus being released?

11:03.096 --> 11:06.071
- That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, thank God.

11:06.167 --> 11:10.743
- Yes. We still have the Bauer
situation to deal with.
- What's the status on that?

11:10.839 --> 11:13.943
Bauer has taken Salazar
from the prison in a helicopter.

11:14.039 --> 11:16.663
We have him in our sights
but are unable to communicate with him.

11:16.759 --> 11:20.278
- So what do you plan on doing?
- Salazar can't be allowed to leave the country.

11:20.374 --> 11:23.223
I'm afraid our only alternative
is to shoot him down.

11:23.351 --> 11:26.807
Mr. Chappelle, my brother is
not gonna like that alternative.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.207
I understand.
That's why I'm calling.

11:29.303 --> 11:32.022
I don't wanna fire on Bauer
without the president's permission.

11:32.118 --> 11:34.679
Yeah, well, the president is in
the middle of a televised debate right now.

11:34.775 --> 11:37.526
- So I'm sorry, but this is gonna have to wait.
- It can't wait.

11:37.622 --> 11:40.758
In a few minutes, their helicopter
is going to be over downtown L. A...

11:40.854 --> 11:44.374
and we'll be unable to shoot it down without
risking significant civilian casualties.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.054
- Let me get back to you, Ryan.
- Soon, Mr. Palmer.

11:48.150 --> 11:50.293
Otherwise, Bauer will be
able to land that chopper...

11:50.389 --> 11:52.918
and disappear with Salazar
into the population.

11:53.014 --> 11:54.997
- Yeah.
- " But by the fourth quarter..."

11:55.093 --> 11:59.957
economic experts are predicting
that not only will those hundred
thousand jobs be regained...

12:00.053 --> 12:03.606
- "a similar number will be created."
- " Senator Keeler."

12:03.702 --> 12:06.997
Whose economic experts,
the administration's?

12:07.125 --> 12:11.125
Well, I for one cannot accept
the blurred numbers...

12:11.221 --> 12:16.693
being projected by the so-called
economic experts of this administration.

12:16.789 --> 12:19.476
- "Those are the people..."
- " David, it's me."

12:19.572 --> 12:23.541
The bio-threat's been eliminated.
We have Kyle Singer in custody.

12:23.637 --> 12:27.093
However, Jack Bauer doesn't know this.
Now he's facilitated Salazar's escape...

12:27.189 --> 12:29.140
and they're in a chopper
on the outskirts of the city.

12:30.196 --> 12:32.436
Now listen to me carefully, David.

12:32.532 --> 12:35.380
It may be necessary to shoot him down.

12:35.476 --> 12:38.932
I would like to hear
the president's answer to that question.

12:39.028 --> 12:42.260
Are you prepared to authorize this?

12:42.356 --> 12:45.076
Mr. President, your response?

12:46.932 --> 12:48.883
Come on, David.
What do you wanna do?

12:51.092 --> 12:54.611
I think the entire American
workforce would like to hear his answer.

12:56.115 --> 13:00.211
- " Mr. President?"
- My fellow Americans...

13:00.307 --> 13:02.995
I have just been informed
of an impending national emergency...

13:03.091 --> 13:04.915
that requires my immediate attention.

13:05.011 --> 13:08.498
Therefore, I must withdraw
from this debate.

13:08.594 --> 13:11.155
Excuse me.

13:12.978 --> 13:17.682
- Now what is this?
- " This is to say"
the least an unusual situation.

13:17.778 --> 13:21.203
No one here
is quite sure what this emergency is.

13:21.299 --> 13:23.538
I need this room cleared.

13:23.634 --> 13:27.251
- Get these people out of here!
- "Until then, let's return you to our local station."

13:40.850 --> 13:43.249
- Hey!
- " Attention, all personnel."

13:43.377 --> 13:45.842
Where're you guys taking me?

13:45.938 --> 13:48.945
Where're you taking me?

13:49.937 --> 13:53.201
Why won't you talk to me?

13:53.297 --> 13:55.761
Hey! Hey!

13:57.905 --> 13:59.793
Help!

14:01.616 --> 14:05.041
Hey, what are you doing?
Where're you going?

14:07.024 --> 14:09.009
Hey!

14:18.992 --> 14:21.137
What's going on?

14:23.696 --> 14:26.992
- Talk to me! Please!
- Kyle, I'm Dr. Duncan.
I need you to calm down.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.008
Where's my girlfriend?
Where's Linda?

14:29.104 --> 14:31.183
We have her in another
part of the facility.

14:31.279 --> 14:33.360
- Is she okay?
- Yes, she's fine.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.047
There's an incubation period of 14 hours.

14:36.143 --> 14:41.263
With this particular virus
if you haven't become symptomatic,
you haven't transmitted it.

14:41.359 --> 14:44.752
What about my parents?
They gonna be okay too?

14:44.848 --> 14:46.959
Yeah. They're on their way.

14:53.679 --> 14:58.319
What happens when I do become...
symptomatic?

15:02.767 --> 15:05.518
It's like that Ebola thing, isn't it?

15:09.839 --> 15:11.726
It's gonna eat me alive.

15:13.998 --> 15:16.398
We'll keep you as
comfortable as possible.

15:31.117 --> 15:33.486
Alpha One, Zebra One, we have visual.

15:33.582 --> 15:38.509
They've got us. They've locked
onto our heat signature.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.165
- Then why aren't they firing?
- I don't know.

15:45.421 --> 15:47.885
Chloe, come on, give me
the hailing frequency.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.412
I can't make the servers
go any faster, okay?

15:53.293 --> 15:55.884
Mr. Chappelle,
we've just locked onto the chopper.

15:55.980 --> 15:59.468
It is not yet over a populated zone.
I need an answer.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.444
How much time
do we have precisely?

16:02.540 --> 16:07.084
Before collateral damage becomes an issue,
just over four minutes.

16:07.180 --> 16:10.668
Stay on course, Major. I'm waiting
to hear back from the president.

16:10.764 --> 16:15.244
We still haven't gotten any indication as
to the nature of this national emergency...

16:15.340 --> 16:17.388
and Senator Keeler's staff...

16:17.484 --> 16:20.523
is questioning whether or not
this emergency actually exists.

16:20.619 --> 16:24.523
If this indeed is a national
emergency of any sort...

16:24.619 --> 16:27.468
that would challenge the nation
at this critical time...

16:27.564 --> 16:29.483
it would be an odd, odd thing.

16:29.611 --> 16:32.075
But nonetheless, something that
should be taken quite seriously.

16:32.171 --> 16:34.987
And so tonight, everyone on
both sides of the aisle is, uh...

16:35.083 --> 16:38.795
beginning to, uh, tread lightly
on the chance, some feel...

16:38.891 --> 16:41.387
Would you give us a moment, please?

16:43.051 --> 16:46.635
Mark, any speculation
as to what the emergency might be?

16:46.731 --> 16:49.450
Well, the auditorium was abuzz
with speculation of all sorts.

16:49.546 --> 16:52.938
And frankly, many handicappers on
the political end of the spectrum anyway...

16:53.034 --> 16:56.266
were putting the president's
chances of prevailing...

16:56.362 --> 16:58.474
David, I'm sorry, but we don't
have a lot of time here.

16:58.570 --> 17:01.546
So what do you wanna do about
shooting down this chopper?

17:03.178 --> 17:06.826
- I can't give the order to kill Jack Bauer.
- But you can't let Salazar go either.

17:10.058 --> 17:13.161
Is it Salazar you're worried about?

17:13.257 --> 17:16.106
Or are you worried that if Jack Bauer lives,
he'll talk about our arrangement?

17:16.202 --> 17:20.361
It's a fair question. To be blunt, yeah,
I am worried about that, even if you're not.

17:20.457 --> 17:23.433
But you still have to think
about national security, David.

17:23.529 --> 17:28.073
Salazar not only runs a drug cartel,
but he's connected to terrorist organizations.

17:28.169 --> 17:30.249
And he has proven to us today
that he has the infrastructure...

17:30.345 --> 17:33.801
to launch a biological attack on our soil.

17:33.897 --> 17:35.881
Now we can't allow him
to do that again.

17:35.977 --> 17:38.921
Jack Bauer sacrificed everything
to prevent that attack.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.312
Jack Bauer volunteered.
Jack Bauer knew the risks.

17:42.408 --> 17:46.441
Now, David, you have got to make this decision
as if it wasn't Jack Bauer on that helicopter.

17:47.848 --> 17:50.312
You have to do what's right
for this country, David.

17:55.592 --> 17:59.720
Listen, this is your call...

17:59.816 --> 18:02.183
but you gotta make it now.

18:07.527 --> 18:10.952
Get me Chappelle.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.895
We now have just over
one minute until they reach the no-fire zone.

18:14.023 --> 18:15.912
I repeat, we have over just one...

18:16.040 --> 18:18.823
Hold on, Major.
Ryan Chappelle.

18:18.919 --> 18:20.744
This is President Palmer.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.207
Why can't you force down that
chopper without firing on it?

18:23.335 --> 18:26.566
Bauer won't communicate with us,
Mr. President. He's forcing our hand.

18:26.663 --> 18:29.639
- How much time do we have?
- "In 60 seconds, he'll be out of reach."

18:31.686 --> 18:33.639
Sir?

18:35.591 --> 18:38.887
- You have my authorization to fire.
- Yes, sir.

18:39.047 --> 18:41.542
- Major, shoot him down.
- Yes, sir.

18:43.238 --> 18:45.383
This is Alpha One to Zebra One
and Zebra Two.

18:45.478 --> 18:48.550
Proceed. You have a go.
I repeat, you have a go.

18:48.646 --> 18:50.533
Roger that, Alpha One.
Preparing to launch.

18:55.238 --> 18:59.782
- Damn it, what's happening?
- They gave the order.

18:59.878 --> 19:01.605
No, please.

19:04.486 --> 19:07.237
I'm at his 6:00 but he's diving.
I don't have a shot.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.021
He's changing course.
Get under him! Get under him!

19:10.117 --> 19:12.165
Do you have a shot?

19:12.261 --> 19:14.917
Negative, negative.
He knows we're on him.
He's maneuvering away.

19:15.013 --> 19:18.789
- I've got a heat source again.
Rockets engage. Going live.
- You're clear for a shot.

19:18.917 --> 19:21.605
Target's locked.
I'm taking the shot.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.589
Hold fire! Hold fire! Standby.

19:23.685 --> 19:25.700
Alpha One, he's reached
the downtown corridor.

19:25.796 --> 19:28.357
- "Please advise. Should we still fire?"
- No. Stand down.

19:28.453 --> 19:31.236
I repeat, do not fire! Do not fire!

19:31.332 --> 19:33.701
Roger that.
Alpha One, standing down.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.940
Hold on. We're going in.

19:37.156 --> 19:40.100
All right, everyone,
fall back to "B"protocols.

19:40.196 --> 19:42.916
Have all units on the ground prepared.

19:43.012 --> 19:45.636
Wherever Bauer lands,
I wanna be on top of him.

19:52.676 --> 19:54.243
He's diving. He's diving.

19:54.339 --> 19:57.060
- "Dessler."
- Michelle, what's going on?

19:57.156 --> 19:58.979
They're not firing.
Jack's over the city.

19:59.075 --> 20:02.083
- Can you get him on
the hailing frequency yet?
- Chloe's getting close.

20:12.675 --> 20:14.498
Okay, he's putting it down.
I've gotta go.

20:14.595 --> 20:16.835
No! Whoa, get me to Chloe!
Get me Chloe!

20:16.931 --> 20:19.522
Yeah.

20:19.618 --> 20:23.394
- Chloe! Chloe!
- Any second now, Chase.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.858
There's no time, damn it!
I need to get through before he lands!

20:37.378 --> 20:39.586
I got it, Chase. I got it.

20:39.682 --> 20:41.378
Patching you through.
You're in, go!

20:41.474 --> 20:43.553
Jack, we found Kyle Singer.

20:43.649 --> 20:46.658
I repeat, we found Kyle Singer.
The virus is contained.

20:46.754 --> 20:48.641
There's no need for you
to be doing this.

21:09.441 --> 21:12.416
Area four, code one.

21:12.512 --> 21:15.329
Area four is in full quarantine.

21:15.425 --> 21:17.248
Mr. And Mrs. Singer,
I'm Dr. Duncan.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.232
- Hi.
- "Hello."

21:21.793 --> 21:25.920
- " One more second."
That's good. Get these.

21:26.016 --> 21:28.864
But our options
for treatment are limited.

21:28.992 --> 21:33.280
I don't... I don't understand. If he's not sick yet,
why isn't there any way to treat him?

21:33.408 --> 21:39.104
Once someone's exposed and starts incubating
the virus, there's nothing we can do.

21:42.815 --> 21:46.879
- Well, how long does he have?
- The lab tests haven't come back yet.

21:46.975 --> 21:49.823
- Once they do, we'll have a more...
- Please, just give me some idea.

21:52.191 --> 21:55.199
Hours, not days.

21:55.295 --> 21:57.535
I'm sorry.

22:01.310 --> 22:03.135
- Can we see him?
- Of course.

22:11.134 --> 22:14.719
- Come on, hon.
- No, I can't. I can't.

22:14.815 --> 22:18.462
Hey, Helen, he needs to know
that we're not angry with him.

22:20.446 --> 22:22.334
Okay?

22:30.014 --> 22:32.317
Almost done.

22:36.445 --> 22:39.422
Kyle, your parents would
like to speak with you.

22:41.853 --> 22:43.997
They can hear you
through the intercom.

22:45.469 --> 22:48.253
Watch yourself. There we go.

22:48.349 --> 22:50.653
Take your time.
I'll be just outside.

23:00.156 --> 23:03.485
- Baby.
- The doctor told us everything.

23:03.613 --> 23:06.716
But maybe they're wrong.

23:06.812 --> 23:09.213
Maybe it isn't as bad as they think.

23:10.300 --> 23:12.284
They're not wrong.

23:14.236 --> 23:17.308
- I deserve what I'm getting.
- "Don't say that."

23:19.356 --> 23:23.836
All you deserved was a father
who could do better for you.

23:23.932 --> 23:26.299
So you wouldn't have
to go and get money...

23:26.395 --> 23:28.860
and bring it home
because I couldn't.

23:29.915 --> 23:32.283
No.

23:32.411 --> 23:37.019
I'm sorry, Kyle. I'm so sorry.

23:39.547 --> 23:41.755
I love you.

23:46.331 --> 23:49.178
You've always taken care of me.

23:52.443 --> 23:56.218
Now I've never...
Now I've never told you this...

23:58.523 --> 24:00.410
but you made me feel safe.

24:02.138 --> 24:06.074
Even now, you make me feel safe.

24:09.498 --> 24:11.578
You did the best you could, Dad.

24:29.497 --> 24:31.385
I don't wanna die.

24:33.369 --> 24:36.153
- I don't wanna die.
- No, no.

24:45.337 --> 24:47.193
Edmunds, C.T.U.
Anybody seen 'em?

24:47.289 --> 24:49.912
Witnesses saw your suspects run down
into the station about five minutes ago.

24:50.008 --> 24:51.865
- How many trains have left?
- Two.

24:51.961 --> 24:54.936
One made a stop 10 blocks east of here.
We got officers searching that area.

24:55.032 --> 24:57.145
We stopped another train in the tunnel.
They're searching it now.

24:57.241 --> 24:59.064
Jack's not gonna let himself
get trapped on a train.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.391
- Do you think he's still down in the tunnel?
- C.T.U., Bauer.

25:02.488 --> 25:06.488
- I need the M.T.A. Schematics
of the Pershing Square station.
- What's going on, Chase?

25:06.584 --> 25:09.144
Your dad got out of the chopper
before I could tell him about Kyle Singer.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.768
- He and Salazar are on the run.
- Hang on.

25:11.864 --> 25:15.256
- Okay, I've got the schematics.
- How many tunnel emergency exits
are between here and Grand?

25:15.352 --> 25:17.367
- Uh...
- Kim?

25:17.463 --> 25:19.287
- I'm looking.
- Come on, let's go!

25:19.383 --> 25:24.535
Th-There's one, in the alley just
off Sixth Street, southwest corner.

25:24.631 --> 25:26.456
How far is that from here?

25:26.552 --> 25:29.463
One block. But they're all one-way,
so you're better off on foot.

25:29.591 --> 25:32.791
- Okay, I'll get back to you.
- "Hey! Are we coordinating"
with you guys or not?

25:42.742 --> 25:44.631
Watch it, buddy.

25:50.679 --> 25:55.254
- " What are you doing?"
What's wrong with you?

25:59.094 --> 26:01.749
Michelle, I just got off the phone with Chase.
He's at the metro station.

26:01.845 --> 26:04.214
- What did he want?
- Information about the subways.

26:04.342 --> 26:06.165
Whatever you gave him,
copy our other agents.

26:06.261 --> 26:08.085
- I did.
- Good.

26:10.933 --> 26:13.781
- They know not to use lethal force, right?
- The mandate's the same.

26:13.909 --> 26:16.469
Stop Salazar by any means necessary.

26:19.861 --> 26:22.133
But now that they're on the ground...

26:22.229 --> 26:26.613
- they can probably do that
without harming your father.
- Right.

26:47.284 --> 26:49.140
- Dessler.
- Michelle, it's Chase.

26:49.236 --> 26:52.980
Jack got out of the tunnel
through a maintenance access
off of Mission, the 900 block.

26:53.076 --> 26:55.443
Redeploy all your people to this area.
Seal off a 10-block radius.

26:55.539 --> 26:57.428
I'm on it.

27:15.795 --> 27:17.715
"Come on, get in."

27:43.282 --> 27:47.058
The exit of the president did come
at a critical time in the debate.

27:47.186 --> 27:50.225
And, uh, even pundits
on both sides of the aisle...

27:50.321 --> 27:53.777
are speculating that, uh,
it is quite odd to say the least...

27:53.873 --> 27:56.209
- "to see a sitting president"
leave an auditorium...
- Yeah, I will.

27:56.305 --> 27:59.153
- "in the middle of his first presidential debate."
- I'll tell him. Thanks.

27:59.281 --> 28:01.905
- "Having said that..."
- That was C.T.U.

28:02.001 --> 28:04.369
They still haven't found
Bauer or Salazar.

28:04.497 --> 28:07.697
L.A.P.D.'s placing a net around
the area where the chopper landed.

28:09.137 --> 28:11.025
Hopefully, they'll be picked up
without incident.

28:11.121 --> 28:13.009
Yeah.

28:14.737 --> 28:16.945
Yeah, it's probably more likely
that Bauer slipped through.

28:17.041 --> 28:18.864
David, listen.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.105
You're gonna have to stop thinking
about his welfare for the moment.

28:21.201 --> 28:25.904
Now Bauer breaking Salazar out of prison
has already leaked to the press.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.328
Now you're gonna have to go out
there and explain to them that's
why you ended this debate...

28:29.456 --> 28:32.465
and then explicitly denounce
what Bauer did.

28:34.896 --> 28:39.024
So Jack puts his life on the line to stop
the virus, and we hang him out to dry.

28:39.120 --> 28:43.247
David, we cannot allow anyone to know
that we sanctioned what he did.

28:43.343 --> 28:46.416
That would do irreparable damage
to you, to the office.

28:48.431 --> 28:50.960
Now you know what
I'm saying is true.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.735
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to let him go.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.782
Who are you calling?

29:16.878 --> 29:18.702
Your pilot.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.774
Your brother gave the F.B.I.
Contact instructions in his last call.

29:21.870 --> 29:24.334
He's got a plane circling
waiting to pick you up.

29:24.430 --> 29:29.358
- C.T.U. Knows about the plane.
Won't that be a problem?
- Not for long.

29:30.414 --> 29:33.646
Yes.

29:33.742 --> 29:35.630
Yeah, this is Jack Bauer.
I've got Salazar.

29:35.726 --> 29:40.622
I'm on a secure cell...
711-star-6559.

29:40.718 --> 29:42.541
Reconfigure your frequency
and call me back.

29:42.637 --> 29:46.637
- If I get confirmation.
- That's right.

29:46.733 --> 29:50.157
- Is this the real thing?
- Yes. Yes, it is. He's got Salazar.

29:50.253 --> 29:52.941
- Call him back and make arrangements.
- And we're buffered from C.T. U?

29:53.037 --> 29:55.405
It's handled.

29:57.869 --> 30:00.461
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

30:00.557 --> 30:04.717
Uh, 2700 block of Figueroa.
We're headed south.

30:04.813 --> 30:06.636
All right.

30:06.732 --> 30:09.421
The closest safe airstrip
is Santa Margarita.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.556
- Do you know where that is?
- Yeah. I can get there in about 10 minutes.

30:13.708 --> 30:17.484
You really are the best, Jack.

30:17.580 --> 30:20.780
When you were down there with us,
I had no idea you were an agent.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.315
We accepted you. You didn't have to
put the needle in your arm.

30:27.372 --> 30:30.092
You did that for other reasons.

30:30.187 --> 30:33.772
The same reason as all junkies...
to kill the pain.

30:34.828 --> 30:37.419
What's your pain, Jack?

30:37.515 --> 30:40.331
What does the needle
make go away, huh?

30:50.539 --> 30:53.835
Make sure to call Division. Tell them that
they need to move their men out of Downey.

30:53.963 --> 30:55.786
- Same place?
- Yeah. We need everyone downtown.

30:55.882 --> 30:58.123
- Okay, I'll make the call.
- " Michelle, Dr. Linzer on line three."

30:58.219 --> 31:01.546
- It'll take a few minutes. Is that all right?
- Call me back with confirmation.

31:01.674 --> 31:03.595
All right.

31:03.723 --> 31:07.242
- Yeah, Doctor?
- Well, your husband's out of surgery.

31:07.338 --> 31:09.227
- How is he?
- Well, there was no nerve damage.

31:09.354 --> 31:11.594
The injury was entirely vascular.

31:11.690 --> 31:15.978
- And, um, it's-it's what we were hoping for, right?
- Yes.

31:16.106 --> 31:18.730
He should recover fully.

31:18.826 --> 31:21.290
Oh, thank God.

31:21.386 --> 31:25.353
Now he's going into post-op now,
so he should be awake in the next hour or so.

31:27.210 --> 31:29.737
I'll be there. Thank you.

31:30.761 --> 31:32.842
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thanks.

31:41.385 --> 31:44.489
Uh...
That was the hospital.

31:44.585 --> 31:46.473
Tony's gonna be okay.

31:50.953 --> 31:53.576
That's good news.

31:53.672 --> 31:55.432
Thank you, Ryan.

31:55.528 --> 31:57.833
Have you heard back from I.N.S?

31:59.016 --> 32:01.096
Yeah, we-we sent out an alert.

32:01.192 --> 32:05.800
- And, uh, we're covered
from Baja to New Mexico.
- How about local airfields?

32:05.896 --> 32:08.488
We're trying to shut down
everything we can...

32:08.584 --> 32:10.472
but we're getting a little bogged down
with the F.A.A.

32:10.568 --> 32:15.272
Have Gael run a pattern analysis on local
air traffic. We may come up with an anomaly.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.320
That's a good idea.

32:27.016 --> 32:29.607
- Kaufman.
- Adam, where's Gael?

32:29.703 --> 32:31.527
Um, uh, tech one.

32:31.623 --> 32:34.151
Kim and I are just about to head down there.
Do you need me to tell him something?

32:34.247 --> 32:38.054
- No, just, uh, send him over to my office.
- Okay. I'll let him know.

32:38.182 --> 32:40.007
Thanks.

32:46.215 --> 32:49.574
Once you get back in the air,
I'll be off-line.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.879
Increment your frequency
every 15 minutes.

32:51.975 --> 32:54.342
- I'll pick you up on 227.
- Roger that.

33:00.422 --> 33:02.149
I'll get back to you.

33:06.054 --> 33:09.766
So everything on the system
hasn't been updated since 11.'00 a.m.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.165
- "So that's where you should start."
- "Fine."

33:12.261 --> 33:15.494
Gael, Michelle needs
to see you in her office.

33:15.590 --> 33:17.797
Okay.

33:17.893 --> 33:19.365
- You can use this station right here.
- Great.

33:19.493 --> 33:22.245
- What's she doing?
- Uh, bringing the logs back up to date.

33:22.341 --> 33:24.165
We got really behind when
everything hit the fan today.

33:24.261 --> 33:27.045
I can do that a lot faster
than she can.

33:27.141 --> 33:29.637
No. Michelle needs
to see you now.

33:42.404 --> 33:46.692
- Okay, you're all set.
- Great.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.740
- See you in a bit.
- Yep.

34:05.028 --> 34:06.851
Sir.

34:08.388 --> 34:10.882
- Can you give me a moment?
- Yeah.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.436
I want these two paragraphs inverted.

34:14.532 --> 34:17.667
And have a secretary
meet me in the morning.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.027
- All right?
- "Yes, sir."

34:24.259 --> 34:27.299
- Is everything okay?
- Well, we had to make some fast choices...

34:27.395 --> 34:29.667
and I couldn't do that
while I was on stage.

34:29.763 --> 34:34.051
- Yes, everything's okay now.
- Are you sure?

34:35.138 --> 34:37.474
This is just damage control.

34:37.570 --> 34:39.523
David, I'm sorry. I just...

34:39.650 --> 34:43.266
I still can't believe Keeler would
repeat those lies in a national debate.

34:43.362 --> 34:45.409
You don't have to apologize for anything.

34:45.505 --> 34:50.498
We didn't sink to their level,
and in the long run, it's gonna pay off.

34:50.594 --> 34:53.090
I hope you're right.

34:53.186 --> 34:55.009
But I'm more
concerned about you.

34:55.105 --> 34:57.826
You've only been brought
into this because of me.

34:59.553 --> 35:03.042
- I'm fine.
- Yes, you are.

35:06.721 --> 35:09.953
David, Jerry's scheduled
a press conference.

35:10.049 --> 35:12.673
- "They're expecting"
your statement this evening.
- Fine.

35:12.769 --> 35:16.481
Good. We've got to get right on a response
to Keeler's accusation about Anne.

35:16.577 --> 35:19.744
- What did the quick polls tell us?
- "Well, I'm not gonna lie to you."

35:19.840 --> 35:21.665
We got hit hard.

35:21.761 --> 35:24.768
Voters who were on the fence
may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.

35:24.864 --> 35:27.233
Well, that is ridiculous.
Once they find out that Ted was lying...

35:27.361 --> 35:31.008
And how are they supposed to do that, Anne?
I mean, it's he said, she said.

35:31.104 --> 35:34.592
See, this is politics. It's not medicine.
So do me a favor and stay out of it.

35:34.688 --> 35:37.152
Stay out of it? I am it!

35:37.248 --> 35:39.200
That's enough!

35:41.728 --> 35:43.583
Wayne, you're gonna have to be patient.

35:43.679 --> 35:46.272
Anne's not going anywhere,
and we're not changing our strategy.

35:48.415 --> 35:51.680
- David, we really need to talk...
- Right now, it's Mr. President.

35:56.736 --> 35:59.135
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

36:08.991 --> 36:13.726
I may not agree with his bedside manner,
but I think he's right.

36:13.854 --> 36:17.311
- You don't need this right now.
- Anne, what are you saying?

36:17.407 --> 36:21.439
I think we should put our relationship
on hold until after the election.

36:21.535 --> 36:25.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa. First of all,
that won't resolve anything.

36:25.630 --> 36:27.646
And second of all, I need you.

36:29.214 --> 36:32.287
Then I'm right here.

36:34.398 --> 36:36.286
That's my lady.

36:44.414 --> 36:46.782
- " And the third series?"
- " Yeah, it'll be isolated."

36:50.846 --> 36:52.733
Wait a minute.

36:54.845 --> 36:58.429
- How can that be?
Have we rechecked these results?
- Three times, Doctor.

36:58.525 --> 37:01.309
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

37:04.445 --> 37:06.333
Okay, thanks.

37:11.996 --> 37:15.293
Yeah, get me Chappelle at C.T.U.
Put him through to my cell.

37:34.652 --> 37:36.219
What's going on?

37:36.315 --> 37:41.307
- There's no trace of the virus in your blood.
- What?

37:41.403 --> 37:45.180
We reran the tests several times
and had them double checked at another lab.

37:45.276 --> 37:48.123
You're clean.

37:48.251 --> 37:50.524
Oh, my God! Ohh!

37:56.315 --> 37:59.099
Duncan.

37:59.195 --> 38:01.018
Nicole, Chappelle.

38:01.114 --> 38:05.115
- Kyle Singer's tests came back negative.
- How is that possible?

38:05.211 --> 38:07.258
It's only possible
if he was never infected.

38:07.354 --> 38:12.058
- So you're telling me this whole
virus scare was a bluff?
- I don't know if I'd say that.

38:12.154 --> 38:14.715
That dead body they dropped off
this morning was definitely infected.

38:14.811 --> 38:18.682
Then why wouldn't they've infected the boy?
What the hell is going on here?

38:18.810 --> 38:21.338
I don't know. You tell me.

38:29.178 --> 38:31.833
What the hell is going on?

38:31.929 --> 38:35.097
You didn't think I was gonna let you
just deliver me and leave, did you?

38:35.193 --> 38:37.145
- Get him out!
- Ramon?

38:37.273 --> 38:40.601
What the hell is going on? Ra...

38:48.537 --> 38:54.137
- Thanks for the ride, Jack.
- "Ramon! Hector said to bring him back...alive."

39:00.152 --> 39:03.001
Fine. Let's go.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.453
Adam.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.788
Adam, there's something
seriously wrong...

40:54.772 --> 40:57.012
I just remembered.

40:59.060 --> 41:02.068
I forgot to close that file.
