WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:05.005
Oh, my God.
She's so adorable.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.974
And she's
healthy.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.909
15 pounds, two ounces.

00:08.943 --> 00:10.911
About average
for a newborn Moclan.

00:10.945 --> 00:14.414
A female baby born to a member
of an all-male species.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.017
Yeah. Bortus, this kid
is one in a million.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.453
ISAAC: In fact,
a Moclan female is born

00:19.486 --> 00:21.989
roughly once
every 75 years.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.423
Well, here's to the
only girl in town.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.926
KLYDEN:
If you all do not mind,

00:25.960 --> 00:27.862
I would like to be alone
with my mate for a moment.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.029
Totally fine.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.030
We should be
on the bridge, anyway.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.165
Come on, guys.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.566
Congrats, you two.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.772
It must be done.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.909
Yes. I will make
the arrangements.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.660
Yaphit, there's nothing
wrong with you.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.196
Oh, I'm pretty sure
there is, Doc.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.864
I haven't been retaining
fluids like I usually do.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.732
My quarters look
like a swamp.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.334
It's a mess.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.004
There's absolutely no evidence
of fluid loss whatsoever.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.672
And-and then
there's this cough.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.408
(coughs) Right?

01:14.441 --> 01:15.809
You don't have lungs,

01:15.842 --> 01:18.412
which means you
don't have a cough.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.547
Yaphit, you've been in sickbay
three times this week.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.482
I know what you're doing.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.419
Claire, look, just let me
take you out on one date.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.720
If you have a crappy night,

01:26.753 --> 01:27.821
I promise I'll never
ask you again.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.223
Yaphit, no.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.724
Besides, we're
incompatible species.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.693
It's impossible.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.162
Huh? There's more
where that came from.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.263
Get out.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.297
All right.

01:41.868 --> 01:44.504
How's it going, man?

01:44.538 --> 01:47.241
BORTUS: Dr. Finn. Bortus, hi.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.244
Hey, have you guys settled on a
name for your little girl yet?

01:50.277 --> 01:53.280
We're all feeling a little funny
just calling her "the baby."

01:53.313 --> 01:56.116
A name would be inappropriate
at this time.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.785
Doctor, I require
your help.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.720
Sure. What do you need?

02:00.754 --> 02:02.689
It would take two weeks
for the Orville

02:02.722 --> 02:04.258
to reach my home planet, Moclus,

02:04.291 --> 02:05.792
from our present location.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.762
And I do not believe the captain
would be able to divert course.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.431
Therefore, Klyden and I
would like you

02:11.465 --> 02:12.699
to perform the procedure.

02:12.732 --> 02:14.268
What procedure?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.603
To conform our child.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.338
To make her a male.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.011

03:27.974 --> 03:31.678
Bortus, there's no way in hell
I'm doing that.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.280
May I ask why not?

03:33.313 --> 03:35.215
You have to ask?

03:35.249 --> 03:37.551
Because I will not perform
a sex change

03:37.584 --> 03:39.686
on a perfectly healthy newborn.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.788
You ever hear
of the Hippocratic Oath?

03:41.821 --> 03:44.324
It is my understanding
that as a doctor,

03:44.358 --> 03:46.293
your duty is to cure illness.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.962
Bortus, this is not an illness.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.131
Your child was born female.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.332
I got news for you.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.234
It happens all the time.

03:54.268 --> 03:57.003
My world is different
than yours.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.573
I would hope that
you would respect that.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.544
I am a Union doctor
serving on a Union ship,

04:04.578 --> 04:08.348
and I will not perform a sex
change on a newborn infant.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.348
It's over, Vasquez.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.384
Surrender now and maybe we'll
ask the judge to go easy on you.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.187
I think maybe you are blind,
señor.

04:47.221 --> 04:51.425
You're outnumbered, and my rifle

There's an entire regiment

Perhaps we settle this

You mean a showdown.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.775
If that's the way
you want it.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.546
No, señor. We will have
a dance contest.

Wait, what?
What is this, man?

we're supposed to have the showdown.
Yeah. What the hell is this?

05:17.117 --> 05:20.720
I have taken many years
of jazz and tap.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.988
If you can beat me
in a dance-off,

05:22.021 --> 05:23.990
I will surrender.

Gordon, what the hell is
going on, man? What is this?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.461
I messed around
with the program. I wanted,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.263
I wanted to mix it up
a little bit. You don't like it?

I infuse many different styles

You will be defeated, señor.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.338
(door opens)

05:38.372 --> 05:41.608
Captain, I must speak with you
immediately.

05:41.641 --> 05:42.842
Bortus, can't it wait, man?

05:42.876 --> 05:43.910
We're in the middle
of a game here.

05:43.943 --> 05:45.645
It is a matter of great urgency.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.781

I'll be back.

Hey, while I'm gone,

Okay. Will do.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.840
All right, what

You know, I get, like,
one free hour a week.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.544
Coffee.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.647
Captain, Dr. Finn
has refused to perform

06:20.680 --> 06:23.283
a necessary medical procedure
on my child.

06:23.317 --> 06:24.884
Medical procedure? What kind?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.520
I thought she said
your kid's totally healthy.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.656
I have asked her to see
to the conversion of my child

06:29.689 --> 06:30.724
to the male gender.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.991
She has refused.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.160
I request you order her
to comply.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.963
You want to perform

06:36.996 --> 06:40.334
a transgender operation
on a baby?

06:40.367 --> 06:42.135
Bortus, that is
completely unethical.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.071
On my world, it would be
unethical not to do so.

06:45.104 --> 06:48.742
Why not just let the kid
decide for herself

06:48.775 --> 06:50.210
when she's old enough?

06:50.244 --> 06:51.911
Captain, in human biology,

06:51.945 --> 06:54.914
is there not an occasional
mutation called a cleft palate?

06:54.948 --> 06:58.318
Yeah, sure. What happens to a
child born with this condition?

06:58.352 --> 07:00.053
It's usually corrected
right after birth,

07:00.086 --> 07:01.821
takes about 12 seconds.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.258
And why do you not wait and let
the child decide for himself

07:04.291 --> 07:06.159
whether he wishes
to correct this condition?

07:06.192 --> 07:07.827
(laughs)
Oh, my God.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.396
You're kidding, right?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.598
Bortus, that is
completely different.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.333
Being a girl is not a condition.

07:13.367 --> 07:14.934
There are no health risks.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.170
Having a vagina doesn't
give you a-a lisp.

07:17.203 --> 07:18.872
I mean, depending
on how you use it.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.340
It is different
for my people.

07:20.374 --> 07:23.843
On our planet,
there are no females.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.347
For you to judge us
by human standards is unfair.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.249
All right, look, even if
I was not against this,

07:29.283 --> 07:31.017
we are on a Union ship.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.687
And, for that matter, your
planet is a member of the Union.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.789
For me to order Claire
to do something like this

07:35.822 --> 07:37.757
would be in violation
of a hundred laws.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.192
Captain, I implore you...

07:39.225 --> 07:41.361
Bortus, I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna do it. All right?

07:41.395 --> 07:43.530
Request denied.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.565
Dismissed.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.939
(sighs)

08:01.648 --> 08:03.617
There's the son of a bitch.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.118
How long until it collides
with the planet?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.786
One month, 17 days.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.122
Well, that gives us
a little time.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.990
Lieutenant Lamarr,
activate cutting beam.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.969
Have you checked
in with Bortus?

08:23.002 --> 08:25.339
I gave him the rest
of the day off.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.573
He was pretty wound up.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.075
I feel so sorry
for that baby.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.177
There's nothing sadder
than an unwanted child.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.746
(sighs)

08:32.779 --> 08:34.581
I got to believe,
at the end of the day,

08:34.614 --> 08:36.249
he has an
open-minded conscience.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.285
Oh, are you guys talking about
Bortus's baby's sex change?

08:39.319 --> 08:40.854
My God, does the whole ship
know about this?

08:40.887 --> 08:42.288
Yes.
Pretty much.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.025
Captain, I do not understand
the reason for this conflict.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.294
Would the gender alteration
procedure harm the infant

08:48.328 --> 08:49.996
or endanger her life?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.031
There are different
kinds of harm, Isaac.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.500
Psychological
harm, for one.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.034
I'd have been
pretty pissed off

08:55.068 --> 08:56.536
if my parents had made
the unilateral decision

08:56.570 --> 08:58.304
to make me a guy.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.007
And while it might have saved me
an entire marriage if they had,

09:01.040 --> 09:02.976
it still would have been wrong.
Oh, thanks.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.545
You guys don't think that
Bortus and Klyden will love her

09:05.579 --> 09:08.448
any less than they would
a male baby, do you?

09:08.482 --> 09:10.016
Well, they'd lose a lot
of friends around here

09:10.049 --> 09:11.385
really fast if they did.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.420
Sir, the asteroid
is breaking up.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.993
The tractor beam can now
alter the path

09:20.026 --> 09:21.695
of the individual fragments.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.129
Lieutenant,
give them a shove.

09:23.162 --> 09:25.331
All right, sir.
Shoving beam on.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.574
Trajectory altered.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.477
The fragments will no longer
collide with Elnath 4.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.647
Well, couldn't save a marriage,
but we just saved a planet.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.315
ALARA:
Captain, we're receiving

09:42.348 --> 09:44.818
a transmission from Moclus.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.319
It's from the head
of Internal Affairs,

09:46.352 --> 09:48.388
a Minister Kaybrak.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.389
Put him on.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.924
Channel open.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.359
Minister Kaybrak,
this is Captain Ed Mercer.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.762
What can I do for you?

09:55.795 --> 09:58.064
Captain, I am informing you
that we are sending a ship

09:58.097 --> 10:00.867
to rendezvous with the Orville
near the Pleiades cluster.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.235
ED:
A ship?

10:02.268 --> 10:04.738
We don't have any
rendezvous orders. What for?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.574
A vessel was requested
by one of your officers.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.217
We are coming
to take the Moclan female.

10:35.301 --> 10:39.038
I want you to tell me just what
the hell you think you're doing.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.240
You want to set up a rendezvous
with another vessel,

10:41.274 --> 10:42.476
you go through Kelly or me.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.978
I am sorry, Captain,
I had no choice.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.814
Don't give me that crap, Bortus.
You are a Union officer.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.484
Do you have any idea the kind of
position you're putting me in?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.919
I am not asking you
to participate, sir.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.087
Klyden and I will transfer

10:54.120 --> 10:55.889
the child to the Moclan vessel,

10:55.922 --> 10:57.557
where she will
undergo the procedure.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.493
The Orville
need not be involved.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.261
The Orvil is involved, Bortus.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.263
By the very fact
that we are the ones

11:04.297 --> 11:05.465
transporting the baby.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.300
What would you
have us do, Captain?

11:07.333 --> 11:10.269
The doctor will not perform
the procedure here,

11:10.303 --> 11:12.939
so we are left with
no other alternative.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.475
That baby was born on a
Union ship to my second officer.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.644
Which means that as
long as she is aboard,

11:17.677 --> 11:20.480
her safety is my responsibility.

11:20.514 --> 11:24.484
With all due respect, sir,
we do not see it that way.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.353
And I do not believe
the Moclan ship will, either.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.490
What does that mean?

11:30.524 --> 11:31.991
What, are you...
what, are you implying

11:32.025 --> 11:34.594
this could lead
to a military conflict?

11:34.628 --> 11:36.329
Bortus, your people
are members of the Union.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.831
Which, by the way,
could be jeopardized

11:37.864 --> 11:40.366
if the admiralty decides
that this is unethical.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.368
Do you see the size
of all of this?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.706
Permission to return
to my station, sir.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.907
No, you're relieved of duty.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.546
(door whooshes open)

11:54.881 --> 11:56.883
(door whooshes shut)

12:02.488 --> 12:04.490
Thanks.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.405
Thanks.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.878
(both sigh)

12:26.179 --> 12:29.148
Kelly, we are doing
the right thing here, yeah?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.550
What do you mean?

12:30.584 --> 12:32.318
Are you doubting it?

12:32.351 --> 12:35.889
Let's say you and I had a baby.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.156
On purpose?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.158
Yeah, and-and imagine

12:39.192 --> 12:42.528
that baby was born
with a third leg.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.263
Like, a whole, full-sized leg?

12:44.297 --> 12:45.832
Yeah, like a, like
an actual leg, with, like,

12:45.865 --> 12:47.567
a foot on the end of it
and everything.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.769
And we had
the doctor remove it.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.238
Now, no one would think twice
about that, right?

12:52.271 --> 12:53.607
Even though there are species

12:53.640 --> 12:55.842
in the galaxy
with three legs,

12:55.875 --> 12:57.343
we would be
conforming that child

12:57.376 --> 12:58.945
to our species' appearance,

12:58.978 --> 13:00.714
and we wouldn't have
any moral qualms about it.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.348
Do you actually believe

13:02.381 --> 13:04.784
that's the same thing
as changing a girl into a boy?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.386
No, I don't.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.956
I-I'm just...
I'm just policing myself,

13:09.989 --> 13:11.791
because we all know
how easy it is

13:11.825 --> 13:13.526
to judge another
culture's way of life

13:13.559 --> 13:14.794
just because
it's alien to us.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.129
But you have to balance that

13:16.162 --> 13:17.931
against some universal code
of ethics.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.365
I mean, suppose
it was their custom

13:19.398 --> 13:21.367
to kill all newborn females.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.369
Should we respect
their culture then?

13:23.402 --> 13:25.872
The Moclans view

13:25.905 --> 13:28.307
the female gender as a handicap.

13:28.341 --> 13:32.445
There's one person on board
who might be able to help.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.247
You ready?

13:34.280 --> 13:37.550
I do not understand
the purpose of this.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.953
The purpose is to get you
to blow off some steam.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.320
I know you've been upset

13:41.354 --> 13:43.389
since the captain
suspended you from duty.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.792
I was unaware that blood sports
were popular on Earth.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.762
Mm, boxing's been gone
a few centuries now,

13:48.795 --> 13:50.664
but Commander Grayson
taught me the basics,

13:50.697 --> 13:53.166
and trust me, it's an art form.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.102
It is my understanding
that striking a fellow officer

13:56.135 --> 13:57.503
is a court-martial offense.

13:57.536 --> 14:00.006
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.775
Although,
a Xelayan female

14:01.808 --> 14:04.978
versus a Moclan? I'm sure the
crew would love to take bets.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.079
Here we go.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.747
Round one, ding, ding.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.482
What is "ding, ding"?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.484
Never mind.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.288
Come on, put your hands up.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.323
Protect your face.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.127
(exhales)

14:33.072 --> 14:34.774
That's more like it.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.342
Okay.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.677
My turn.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.583
(grunting)

14:45.919 --> 14:48.021
Not bad for a female, huh?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.623
I am growing weary
of my shipmates

14:50.656 --> 14:53.326
imposing their will
upon my family.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.528
Have you ever stopped to think
that maybe they're right?

14:55.561 --> 14:58.197
I will decide what is best
for my child!

15:24.023 --> 15:25.759
(groans)

15:25.792 --> 15:27.193
(moans)

15:27.226 --> 15:28.427
(sighs)

15:28.461 --> 15:31.697
Bortus. What happened to you?

15:31.731 --> 15:34.734
There was an explosion
in engineering. I am fine.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.102
Why the ice pack?

15:36.135 --> 15:38.337
Dr. Finn can repair your injury.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.173
Do you not have somewhere
you need to be?

15:40.206 --> 15:41.507
You are snippy.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.076
I am not snippy.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.778
Very well.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.781
I'm going to get new clothing
for our trip to Moclus.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.015
Mind the baby.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.416
Fine.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.621
GORDON:
Oh. Sorry, Klyden.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.556
Hey, yo, Bortus,
mind if we come in?

15:57.590 --> 15:58.792
Now is not a good time.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.193
What happened to your head?

16:00.226 --> 16:02.228
I said go away.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.931
Listen, we feel really bad about
everything that's been going on,

16:04.964 --> 16:07.566
so we thought you might
need a little cheering up.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.468
How about a beer and a movie?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.270
I am not in the mood.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.806
Ah, come on.
You're laid up anyway.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.141
What do you say? A couple of
brews and an old Earth flick.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.342
Huh?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.779
SANTA (over TV):
Rudolph. Rudolph, please.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.815
Would you tone it down a bit?
(Rudolph's nose ringing)

16:21.848 --> 16:24.617
I mean, that nose of yours.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.453
I... That nose.

16:27.486 --> 16:31.224
That beautiful, wonderful nose.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.558
RUDOLPH:
Huh?

16:32.591 --> 16:35.661
Rudolph, Christmas is not off.

16:35.694 --> 16:38.297
What I'm trying to say is,

16:38.331 --> 16:41.567
Rudolph, with your nose
so bright,

16:41.600 --> 16:45.404
won't you guide
my sleigh tonight?

16:45.438 --> 16:47.406
It will be an honor, sir.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.843
(cheering)

16:49.876 --> 16:52.946
Okay, Rudolph. Full power.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.981
(Rudolph's nose ringing)

16:57.016 --> 17:00.286
Up, up, up and away!

17:00.319 --> 17:02.688
(movie stops playing)

17:02.721 --> 17:06.159
Of course.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.194
Without Rudolph's nose,

17:08.227 --> 17:11.164
Santa would not have been able
to complete his voyage.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.332
Looks like Santa got
pretty lucky, huh?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.468
Christmas would have been ruined

17:15.501 --> 17:18.004
if Rudolph
had been euthanized at birth,

17:18.037 --> 17:20.306
as his father wished.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.209
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
if that was ever on the table.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.512
What was clearly a deformity

17:26.545 --> 17:30.816
became a supreme advantage.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.486
One can never know.

17:33.519 --> 17:36.689
Please, watch the child for me.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.524
I must find Klyden.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.826
Yeah, no-no problem.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.729
Hey, he just left his baby
with two drunk dudes.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.731
Reminds me of my dad.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.934
Ah, I miss him.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.320
Klyden, we must speak.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.521
About what?

18:08.554 --> 18:11.090
I have had cause
to reconsider the...

18:11.124 --> 18:12.658
We require privacy.

18:12.691 --> 18:14.227
Leave now!

18:14.260 --> 18:17.830
Wow. Nice day to you, too, dick.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.899
Klyden...

18:19.933 --> 18:24.537
I believe we should leave
our baby unaltered.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.939
What?

18:25.972 --> 18:27.873
Bortus, you cannot be serious.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.275
I am.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.945
We must raise the child
as a female.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.279
Out of the question.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.514
Why would you suggest
such a thing?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.951
Because I have witnessed events
that have opened my eyes.

18:37.984 --> 18:41.387
We do not know what kind of
future we are taking from her.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.924
She may be destined
to do great things as a female.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.559
Impossible.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.695
Klyden, you must hear
the tale of Rudolph.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.598
You will rethink your
conviction, I promise you.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.700
My conviction will not change.

18:54.733 --> 18:55.801
You cannot be certain of that.

18:55.834 --> 18:56.936
Indeed, I can.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.804
How?
Because...

18:58.837 --> 19:02.841
I was born a female.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.627
Klyden, how could you
have kept this from me?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.062
I am your mate.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.065
When we first met,
I did not know.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.167
My parents had
the procedure done

19:28.201 --> 19:30.636
on Moclus soon after I was born.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.671
And when did you find out?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.142
When you were assigned
to the USS Clemens

19:36.175 --> 19:38.978
and I moved on board with you.

19:39.012 --> 19:42.915
It was my first examination
by a non-Moclan physician.

19:42.948 --> 19:46.319
The doctor discovered
evidence of the alteration.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.588
I was unprepared.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.924
And why did you not
tell me then?

19:51.957 --> 19:54.327
(baby crying)

19:54.360 --> 19:57.997
Because I did not
want to lose you.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.171
Klyden, I love you.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.173
That has not changed.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.442
I am angry because
you withheld this from me.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.577
You lied.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.848
I did not believe
it was of consequence.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.950
That is not the reason,
and you know it.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.952
Your parents

20:19.985 --> 20:22.155
made this decision for you.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.957
You do not know what your life
would have been like.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.559
I would have been an outcast.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.627
Do not pretend otherwise.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.163
Or perhaps you would have
achieved glory

20:30.196 --> 20:32.665
for guiding Santa Claus
on Christmas Eve.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.068
What?
(comm beeping)

20:35.101 --> 20:36.902
KELLY: Bortus, the captain says
get your ass up here.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.038
The Moclan vessel
is approaching.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.678
(door whooshes open)

20:57.423 --> 20:59.925
ED: As if all this couldn't get
any more complicated.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.694
I do not see any complication.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.696
The child will be taken
to Moclus,

21:03.729 --> 21:06.099
where she will undergo
the corrective procedure.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.734
Don't start passing out penises
just yet, Captain Vorak.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.270
The parents are in disagreement
about what's best for the child.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.539
In such an instance,
the Moclan state

21:13.572 --> 21:15.708
is ethically bound
to side with the parent

21:15.741 --> 21:17.910
in favor of correcting
the condition.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.212
"Condition."

21:19.245 --> 21:20.279
So to you people,
being a woman

21:20.313 --> 21:21.714
is like having
chronic diarrhea.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.749
Look, Kel, I think
we should focus on...

21:23.782 --> 21:25.418
Hey, Doc, I'm not feeling well.
I've had the tits all day.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.721
Captain Vorak, I will not
allow that child to be taken

21:28.754 --> 21:31.023
off the Orville
without Bortus's consent.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.959
Look, I suggest we all
just take a beat here,

21:33.992 --> 21:35.561
let the admiral sort this out.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.029
In the meantime, you can
hang out on our ship.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.131
We have board games.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.965
We have Scrabble.
We have Candy Land.

21:39.998 --> 21:41.134
We have Monopoly.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.468
You can be the car.

21:42.501 --> 21:44.903
Ah, ah, Kel, I'm-I'm
always the car.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.240
Yeah, but maybe this one
time, since he's our guest.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.242
You can be the thimble.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.610
The matter is settled.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.046
We will depart for Moclus
within the hour,

21:54.079 --> 21:57.049
and we will take
the child with us.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.784
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.486
You will stand aside.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.954
I will not.
Captain, do you require...

22:01.987 --> 22:03.322
No. Sit down, Bortus.

22:03.356 --> 22:07.126
You are very fragile,
Captain Mercer.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.262
Are you aware of this?

22:09.295 --> 22:10.796
There's an antibullying law
named after me.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.265
Yes, I'm aware of it.

22:12.298 --> 22:15.968
Captain Vorak,
I formally request tribunal.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.903
What? Bortus, you cannot.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.172
It is the only way.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.740
What's tribunal?
Like, take it to court?

22:21.774 --> 22:23.176
In a manner of speaking.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.444
We will be mocked
and ridiculed.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.080
Our shame will be
on display for all.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.616
Then do not compel our child
to undergo the procedure.

22:30.649 --> 22:32.185
It is irrelevant.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.620
No advocate on Moclus
would defend such a thing.

22:34.653 --> 22:37.756
To my knowledge, the advocate
need not be a Moclan.

22:37.790 --> 22:42.027
Captain, I request
that you be my advocate.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.330
Wh... You want me
to be your lawyer?

22:44.363 --> 22:45.431
Yes.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.099
No, I won't do it.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.834
BORTUS: Captain, I beg you.
But Kelly will.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.135
What?

22:50.169 --> 22:51.870
You took a year of
interplanetary law

22:51.904 --> 22:53.872
at Union Point, right?
Yeah. One year.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.174
Yeah, that's a year
more than I've had.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.276
Ed, I don't want
this responsibility.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.777
I cannot be the one
to determine that child's...

22:58.811 --> 23:00.513
Commander.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.315
Please.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.253
I'll do my best.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.224
Mercer to bridge.

23:11.257 --> 23:12.725
Set a course for Moclus.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.293
GORDON:
Aye, sir.

23:14.327 --> 23:15.794
Our ship will
accompany you there.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.231
How do I know you will not flee
with the infant?

23:18.264 --> 23:21.634
Klyden and I will travel
with you on board your ship.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.902
We will bring the child.

23:23.936 --> 23:27.005
Very well.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.275
(door whooshes open)

23:38.116 --> 23:40.018
Safe travels, Bortus.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.854
We'll see you soon.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.989
"Between soul and sacrifice

23:44.022 --> 23:46.425
beats the heart
of civilization."

23:46.459 --> 23:47.926
What's that from?

23:47.960 --> 23:50.529
It is from a novel
by Gondus Elden,

23:50.563 --> 23:52.731
a Moclan writer of great esteem.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.600
It is customary

23:54.633 --> 23:56.735
to respond
with a fitting passage

23:56.769 --> 23:58.804
from the literature
of one's own planet.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.409
"I'm a survivor.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.043
"I'm not gon' give up.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.845
"I'm not gon' stop.

24:06.879 --> 24:07.880
I'm-a work harder."

24:07.913 --> 24:09.848
Those are words of great power.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.284
Who wrote them?

24:11.317 --> 24:14.720
I think it was actually
about 15 different people.

24:14.753 --> 24:17.890
They must be very wise,
these 15 people.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.159
Well, you should, uh,
probably get going.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.965

♪

25:22.655 --> 25:24.323
CLAIRE:
I hate this planet.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.091
They've completely
industrialized

25:26.124 --> 25:27.460
the entire surface.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.628
It's amazing
they can even breathe.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.837
Oh, my God, they're
under attack.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.138
Alara, those are testing zones.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.306
What are you talking about?

25:41.340 --> 25:43.676
Moclus's primary industry
is weapons manufacture,

25:43.709 --> 25:45.110
so they're
a little fast and loose

25:45.143 --> 25:46.679
with their research
and development.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.014
They test explosives
wherever the hell they want.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.050
Oh, crap!

25:56.722 --> 25:59.057
Commander Grayson

25:59.091 --> 26:00.859
What the hell are you bastards
trying to do?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.828
MOCLAN: Our deepest apologies,
Commander.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.997
That testing zone
was added this morning.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.733
We neglected to include it
in your flight plan.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.802
That's great.
Thanks for thinking of us.

26:09.835 --> 26:12.571
I'm gonna need a pair of pants
brought to the landing site.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.707
We will have pants waiting for you.
He's kidding.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.208
No, I'm not.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.925
Tribunal begins.

26:32.958 --> 26:36.562
Advocate Kagus,
please begin your inquiry.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.565
Lieutenant
Commander Bortus,

26:39.598 --> 26:43.268
how long have you and Klyden
been mates?

26:43.301 --> 26:45.037
Six and a half years.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.873
Tell me about your gomaskah,

26:47.906 --> 26:51.209
what you humans call
"a first date."

26:51.243 --> 26:54.947
Klyden and I shared an evening
meal at the dining establishment

26:54.980 --> 26:57.416
atop the Moclan Central Arcade.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.352
We then played combat games
in the environmental simulator.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.556
Was it a pleasurable experience?

27:03.589 --> 27:05.223
Yes. Between the two of us,

27:05.257 --> 27:07.125
Klyden and I shot

27:07.159 --> 27:09.361
339 simulated combatants.

27:09.394 --> 27:11.129
Hot date.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.099
And is it your wish
to deny your offspring

27:14.132 --> 27:15.934
that same experience?

27:15.968 --> 27:18.036
No. However...

27:18.070 --> 27:19.772
Are you aware that by electing

27:19.805 --> 27:22.775
to forego the gender
correction procedure,

27:22.808 --> 27:26.311
you are condemning your child
to a life of shame?

27:26.344 --> 27:27.546
She will forever be alone,

27:27.580 --> 27:30.082
an object of disgust.

27:30.115 --> 27:32.217
Never will she experience

27:32.250 --> 27:35.320
a "first date."

27:35.353 --> 27:38.290
BORTUS: I have recently
come to believe

27:38.323 --> 27:41.393
that we are unable to make
such predictions with accuracy.

27:41.426 --> 27:44.329
I feel the decision
should be hers.

27:44.362 --> 27:46.565
How generous of you.

27:46.599 --> 27:49.101
However, by the time

27:49.134 --> 27:51.637
she is old enough to have
developed the sense of self

27:51.670 --> 27:53.739
necessary to make that decision,

27:53.772 --> 27:56.108
the childhood damage
will be done.

27:56.141 --> 27:59.512
In all likelihood,
she will despise you

27:59.545 --> 28:03.516
for not sparing her the pain
when you had the chance.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.351
That is a risk
I am willing to take.

28:06.384 --> 28:08.186
I am not.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.287
(gavel pounds)

28:09.321 --> 28:12.390
Observers will remain silent.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.896
My inquiry is complete.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.867
Advocate Grayson,
begin your inquiry.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.536
Thank you.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.839
Request Lieutenant Alara Kitan
to the inquiry chair.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.777
Advocate Kagus,

28:31.810 --> 28:35.213
why is it so bad
to be born female?

28:35.247 --> 28:37.883
It is a serious
birth defect,

28:37.916 --> 28:41.687
which severely limits
the ability to function:

28:41.720 --> 28:44.389
biologically, intellectually
and socially.

28:44.422 --> 28:45.891
Interesting.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.060
Let's look at the
biological end of it.

28:48.093 --> 28:49.528
What are the drawbacks?

28:49.562 --> 28:51.697
Females are weak.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.332
They do not possess
the physical strength

28:54.366 --> 28:56.501
necessary for effective

28:56.535 --> 28:59.471
participation in industrialized
Moclan society.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.907
Hmm. Okay.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.009
Arbitrator, would you be so kind

29:04.042 --> 29:07.345
as to loan me your gavel thingy?

29:07.379 --> 29:10.315
Thank you.

29:10.348 --> 29:14.286
Advocate, would you do me
a favor and reshape this cube?

29:16.054 --> 29:17.189
Impossible.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.490
Why?

29:18.523 --> 29:20.525
It is solid titanium.

29:20.559 --> 29:21.694
All right.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.863
Alara, would you mind
taking a whack at it?

29:39.311 --> 29:43.248
The tribunal will note
that this female

29:43.281 --> 29:45.550
was more than strong enough
to reshape the cube.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.788
Show me a male in this chamber
who can do the same.

29:49.822 --> 29:50.923
KAGUS:
Irrelevant.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.925
She is Xelayan.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.260
All members of their species

29:55.293 --> 29:56.629
possess elevated
physical strength

29:56.662 --> 29:58.530
due to a high level
of gravity

29:58.563 --> 30:00.565
on their home world.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.868
In fact, if there were
a Xelayan male here,

30:02.901 --> 30:04.469
he could reshape
the titanium

30:04.502 --> 30:06.772
with half as much effort.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.240
I think the tribunal will grant

30:08.273 --> 30:10.075
that since there's
no Xelayan male present,

30:10.108 --> 30:13.578
that absurd statement
is purely speculative.

30:13.612 --> 30:17.115
Now, onto your assertion about
male intellectual superiority.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.252
Lieutenant Malloy, I'm gonna
ask you a few questions

30:20.285 --> 30:22.554
that one might find on any
basic test of adult knowledge.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.089
Go for it.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.925
These are gonna be
kind of hard for you. Sorry.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.093
It's okay, Commander.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.594
It's for the baby.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.930
Let's start off with
some Earth history.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.667
A few hundred years ago,
the continents of Earth

30:34.700 --> 30:36.669
were divided into separate
nation states

30:36.702 --> 30:38.937
with individual
sovereign governments.

30:38.971 --> 30:42.240
What was the capital of
the United States of America?

30:42.274 --> 30:45.477
Um... pass.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.179
No, it's-it's not
a pass kind of thing.

30:47.212 --> 30:49.014
Just give me your closest guess.

30:49.047 --> 30:50.348
What was the capital

30:50.382 --> 30:51.817
of the United States
of America?

30:53.318 --> 30:54.920
Nabisco?

30:54.953 --> 30:56.021
No.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.023
The moon?
Let's move on.

30:58.056 --> 31:00.292
What are the four chambers
of the human heart?

31:00.325 --> 31:03.095
The chamber of secrets,

31:03.128 --> 31:05.430
the chamber of horrors,

31:05.463 --> 31:06.699
the chamber of...

31:06.732 --> 31:08.200
No, no, let me
get you halfway.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.002
There's the left
and the right ventricle

31:10.035 --> 31:13.305
and the left and the right...

31:13.338 --> 31:16.008
I would like to switch
to movie trivia.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.642
KELLY:
Let's try one more.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.544
In the year 2056,

31:19.577 --> 31:22.147
which genetic engineer
discovered how to target

31:22.180 --> 31:24.783
and eradicate
individual cancer cells?

31:24.817 --> 31:25.818
Doctor...

31:26.985 --> 31:29.454
...Bill Nye the Cancer Guy?

31:29.487 --> 31:31.556
Well, my point is made.

31:31.589 --> 31:34.392
While this male may be
the fleet's best pilot,

31:34.426 --> 31:35.527
he's also an idiot.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.129
Sorry, Gordon.

31:37.162 --> 31:39.297
Totally okay.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.701
The tribunal must acknowledge
that there is no valid claim

31:42.735 --> 31:46.471
for gender-based superiority.

31:46.504 --> 31:48.874
Inquiry complete.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.976
KAGUS:
Dr. Finn,

31:51.009 --> 31:53.879
it is my understanding
that you refused to perform

31:53.912 --> 31:56.882
the gender alteration procedure
on the child in question.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.316
Correct?
That's right.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.253
No ethical doctor anywhere
would do it.

32:01.286 --> 32:03.188
Captain Mercer.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.592
Tell me about your penis.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.262
Uh... did I miss a segue
of some kind here?

32:10.295 --> 32:11.529
(laughs) What?

32:11.563 --> 32:13.331
Are you, what is the term?

32:13.365 --> 32:14.733
Circumcised?

32:14.767 --> 32:16.701
Gosh, you know,
I don't usually discuss that

32:16.735 --> 32:17.936
till the second date.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.205
I will rephrase.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.907
Are there cultures
within the Union

32:21.940 --> 32:24.242
who circumcise their offspring?

32:24.276 --> 32:25.744
Yes, there are some.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.346
Doctor, if a member
of one of those

32:28.380 --> 32:32.417
races asked you to
circumcise their infant,

32:32.450 --> 32:34.086
would you refuse?

32:34.119 --> 32:35.921
That's completely different.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.189
How?

32:37.222 --> 32:40.092
It is a significant
bodily alteration,

32:40.125 --> 32:42.627
and the infant has
no say in the matter.

32:42.660 --> 32:46.464
A circumcision is not
a life-altering scenario.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.534
And a life-altering scenario

32:49.567 --> 32:51.703
would be unfair to the child.

32:51.736 --> 32:53.605
Yes, it would.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.774
A life-altering scenario,

32:55.808 --> 32:59.044
such as a child shunned
by Moclan society,

32:59.077 --> 33:00.745
planet-wide,

33:00.779 --> 33:02.815
that would be unfair indeed.

33:02.848 --> 33:06.618
Thank you, Doctor,
you've made my argument for me.

These are the exact coordinates.

coming from

this continued delay

My name is Heveena.

to my knowledge,

there's no prohibition
against the testimony

36:44.236 --> 36:45.837
of a Moclan female.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.872
That is correct.

36:54.046 --> 36:57.049
(cane tapping floor)

36:59.084 --> 37:02.454
When I was born, long ago,

37:02.487 --> 37:04.689
my parents made the choice

37:04.722 --> 37:08.160
to allow me to remain female.

37:08.193 --> 37:11.129
They believed that
to have me altered

37:11.163 --> 37:13.165
would be an offense to nature.

37:13.198 --> 37:17.402
So they took me far up
into the mountains

37:17.435 --> 37:19.671
and built our family a home.

37:19.704 --> 37:21.473
In seclusion.

37:21.506 --> 37:24.209
They taught me to think,

37:24.242 --> 37:27.312
to read, to wonder.

37:27.345 --> 37:31.049
They taught me to love
the person I was.

When they passed,

37:33.285 --> 37:35.987
I remained.

I had planned
to die up there.

Undiscovered.

37:41.726 --> 37:44.862
But that is
no longer possible.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.733
The tribunal must not be allowed
to take from this child

37:48.766 --> 37:51.736
the gift that I was given!

37:51.769 --> 37:54.739
So I present
myself to you,

undergo the procedure.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.339
Well, I doubt the
arbitration council does.
