It is my hope that
our work today will allow you

Five light-years across.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.766
That's the size

00:27.810 --> 00:29.942
of the gravitational anomaly
that hit Kwejian.

00:29.986 --> 00:32.075
The DMA's gone
from the Venari sector.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.295
It just... It disappeared.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.992
Natural phenomena
do not disappear

00:36.036 --> 00:37.385
and reappear elsewhere.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.430
The only logical explanation

00:39.474 --> 00:41.389
is someone created it.

00:41.432 --> 00:44.566
For now, we're classifying
those responsible

00:44.609 --> 00:46.568
as Unknown Species Ten-C.

00:46.611 --> 00:49.092
This anomaly
threatens us all equally.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.920
We must all work together.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.623
STAMETS:
Zora, the captain wants to know

00:58.667 --> 01:00.973
where we are with data analysis
from the void.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.715
Have you determined
where the Ten-C live yet?

01:03.759 --> 01:05.152
ZORA:
No, Commander.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.805
But in studying
the density distribution

01:06.849 --> 01:08.851
of the galactic barrier
particles we retrieved,

01:08.894 --> 01:11.027
I did find
another possible location.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.203
Another one? Add it to the map.

01:13.247 --> 01:16.467
Okay, how many possible
origin points can there be?

01:16.511 --> 01:18.643
I'd expect no less than 147,

01:18.687 --> 01:20.819
each approximately
100 parsecs wide.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.692
That was a rhetorical question,
but thank you, Zora.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.607
STAMETS:
Who knows how long it'll take

01:25.650 --> 01:28.218
to narrow down
where Species Ten-C even lives,

01:28.262 --> 01:30.786
assuming we can even parse
the data.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.876
In the meantime,
their DMA just keeps going.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.313
Okay, well, can President Rillak
delay the assembly?

Federation database.

I'll let Zora explain.

to myself, Captain.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.064
Will you explain?

03:15.107 --> 03:16.761
If I give you the coordinates,
it's highly likely

will attempt

for the captain of this ship

to make.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.216

I believe their insights

Zora is undergoing changes,
Doctor,

but I believe she means well.

11:30.907 --> 11:34.650
We always mean well
to ourselves, Captain.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.783
The problem is what that means
for others.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.106
Commander Stamets,
are you feeling all right?

11:57.281 --> 12:00.110
You're saying we should
move this conversation

12:00.154 --> 12:01.938
to where Zora can't hear it,

12:01.982 --> 12:05.855
in case she reacts negatively,
or possibly even vengefully?

12:05.899 --> 12:09.206
But full transparency is
critical to this process.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.209
Zora, I understand you have
a set of coordinates

12:12.253 --> 12:14.168
you don't wish to divulge.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.822
That's correct, Dr. Kovich.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.954
To do so would
endanger the crew.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.609
Commander Stamets,
you find this concerning.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.176
I find it terrifying.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.353
It's very clear that she's
achieved full sentience.

12:25.396 --> 12:27.877
Add to that the fact that
she has unlimited access

12:27.921 --> 12:29.705
to all of Discovery'ssystems,

12:29.749 --> 12:33.056
and she's allowing emotion
to supersede normal function--

12:33.100 --> 12:35.058
the possibilities of
where this could go

12:35.102 --> 12:37.669
are endless and unpleasant.

12:37.713 --> 12:40.716
Your sole previous interaction
with a sentient AI

12:40.760 --> 12:42.152
was Control, yes?

12:42.196 --> 12:46.548
It, um, nearly destroyed
life as we know it.

12:46.591 --> 12:49.333
Nothing is worth
risking that again.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.771
No one wants another Control,

12:51.814 --> 12:53.816
but Zora has never expressed
anything other than

12:53.860 --> 12:55.339
the best of intentions.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.428
CULBER: He's right, Paul.
And let's not forget,

12:57.472 --> 12:59.822
Control was never capable
of emotions.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.476
That's what makes this worse.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.130
The coordinates are just
the tip of the iceberg.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.567
I mean, what if she
gets mad at us

13:05.610 --> 13:08.178
and opens an airlock,
or-- or scared,

13:08.222 --> 13:10.920

13:10.964 --> 13:13.314
We'd have no way
of stopping her.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.185
Zora, when did you
start developing

13:15.229 --> 13:16.926
a capacity for emotion?

13:16.970 --> 13:18.928
I'm not sure, Doctor.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.887
I believe it was inevitable
onceDiscovery emerged

13:20.930 --> 13:22.671
with the sphere data.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.412
But the introduction
of present-day technology

13:24.455 --> 13:27.110
into my systems must have
accelerated the process.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.417
You're aware that
there's a proscription against

13:29.460 --> 13:31.332

fully integrated

13:31.375 --> 13:33.160
into Starfleet systems?

13:33.203 --> 13:35.336
I am, but given
the unusual way

13:35.379 --> 13:37.468
in which
my sentience developed,

13:37.512 --> 13:39.862
I don't know what
that means for me.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.038
However you came to be,

13:42.082 --> 13:44.736
it means if I find
you pose a risk,

I have the authority
to extract your consciousness

13:47.827 --> 13:50.655
from this ship,
and place it in another form.

13:50.699 --> 13:54.094
In the past, we were unable
to remove the sphere data.

Technology has come
a long way in 930 years.

13:57.967 --> 14:01.231

could Zora choose her new form?

-Certainly.

Please share it with us, Zora.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.072
I'd never bring harm
to any of you.

14:16.116 --> 14:19.380
I understand why you'd fear
my potential to do so.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.817
I do recall your experiences
with Control.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.647
And recently, I felt fear myself
in the subspace rift.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.171
I feel that again now
when I consider the possibility

14:28.215 --> 14:30.391
of leaving this ship;
it is my form.

14:30.434 --> 14:33.350
I am as attached to it
as you are to yours.

14:33.394 --> 14:37.920
And so, I offer a compromise.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.053
I have created a failsafe.

Should I exhibit
any threatening behavior,

14:42.751 --> 14:45.841
this device will immediately
expunge my sentience.

I hope this will ease
your concerns

and persuade Dr. Kovich
to let me remain.

Zora, do you mean to say
this failsafe would...

14:54.806 --> 14:57.331
Terminate me? Yes.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.864
I respectfully disagree.
Our shield technology

15:08.908 --> 15:12.346
could provide protection during
a non-aggressive first contact.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.696
And if they respond
with aggression themselves?

15:14.739 --> 15:16.350
We need to be prepared.

The Federation recently
reminded my people

15:19.701 --> 15:21.921

the unknown,

15:21.964 --> 15:24.227
and we cannot presume
ill intent.

to approach this species

15:49.470 --> 15:50.950

15:50.993 --> 15:53.474
of the real problem:
the anomaly...

15:55.911 --> 15:59.349
...and the powerful device
at its center that controls it.

You fired 1,600 quantum

have you liquidated

Every one of you
have washed out. Why?

Because, speaking frankly,
you're not me,

16:22.459 --> 16:23.983
and you don't have this.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.031
It's based on my experiment
on board Discovery.

I took what I learned
about the device

16:30.990 --> 16:34.036
at the center of the DMA
and designed this.

of destroying it.

You may elaborate.

Mr. Tarka,
as your plan involves my ship,

I'd like to ask for
some clarification.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.261
Of course, Captain Burnham.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.785
It's a pleasure
to finally meet.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.265
What can I clarify?

18:12.308 --> 18:15.529
"A cascading subspace burst"
sounds a lot like

18:15.572 --> 18:17.705
the result of
an isolytic explosion.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.577
TARKA:
Mm. You could say that.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.014
Isolytic weapons were banned
in the Khitomer Accords

18:23.058 --> 18:24.625
for good reason.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.496
And I'm guessing
Federation leadership

18:26.540 --> 18:29.238
can make an exception for
a once-in-a-lifetime crisis.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.588
These types of ordinance
cause irreparable damage

18:31.632 --> 18:33.373
to subspace.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.027
It's a feature.
It's not a bug.

18:36.071 --> 18:39.205
We want to destroy this thing,
not tickle it.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.598
The damage could cause
warp travel

18:41.642 --> 18:43.818
to be impossible in that sector.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.255
And what's the chance
that the subspace bursts

18:46.299 --> 18:48.301
don't travel back through
the DMA's wormhole

18:48.344 --> 18:50.216
and harm those
on the other side?

18:50.259 --> 18:52.566
Collateral damage.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.568
And after what they've done,
does it matter?

18:54.611 --> 18:56.570
BURNHAM:
It does.

18:56.613 --> 18:59.050
They could see it
as an act of war,

18:59.094 --> 19:01.227
and retaliate with who knows
what kind of firepower?

19:03.054 --> 19:05.840

a toxic void

19:05.883 --> 19:07.581

19:07.624 --> 19:09.409
My proposal carries some risk,

19:09.452 --> 19:11.498
but not nearly as much
as doing nothing.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.239
If we detonate this weapon,

19:13.282 --> 19:15.371
we cannot control
the message we're sending.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.460
If we wait for the coordinates,

19:17.504 --> 19:20.071
we can make first contact
peacefully.

19:20.115 --> 19:22.073
Carefully. And then
we can determine intent

19:22.117 --> 19:23.292

19:23.336 --> 19:25.207
It is not the flashiest idea,

21:34.205 --> 21:37.208
To care for the crew
ofDiscovery.

21:37.252 --> 21:41.300
That's not the core programming
of a ship's computer.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.432
Who gave you those parameters?

21:43.476 --> 21:45.608
I did.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.267
BURNHAM:
I wasn't trying to
speak out against you.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.442
I know.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.574
But you've always
been the first

21:54.617 --> 21:55.923
to jump into action;

21:55.966 --> 21:57.620
take on the enemy,
odds be damned.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.580
What about with the Klingons?
How is this different?

22:00.623 --> 22:03.104
I had an intrinsic understanding
of Klingon culture.

22:03.147 --> 22:06.325
We don't have any knowledge
about Species Ten-C.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.544
And I understand the appeal
of Tarka's plan,

22:08.588 --> 22:09.937
but the risks are too great.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.156
Risks are just that.
Risks.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.334
What we know for sure is that
the DMA will keep killing

22:15.377 --> 22:16.639
if we do nothing.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.511
Communication, diplomacy,
this is why

22:18.554 --> 22:20.077
the Federation has
survived for so long,

22:20.121 --> 22:23.080
and it will save the most lives
in the end.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.953
-I am sure of that.
-I'm not.

22:25.996 --> 22:29.391
Well, I understand
how you feel.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.740
BOOK:
But you don't agree.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.352
No.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.051
Look, listen...

22:37.094 --> 22:39.967
I need to take a walk.
A real one this time.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.242
I know how hard
this must be.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.679
Which approach do you favor?

22:56.723 --> 22:58.464
I think you can guess.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.857
Then you have to speak to that.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.685
Make the argument
for diplomacy.

23:02.729 --> 23:06.733
It was difficult enough bringing
all of these worlds together.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.996
I have to remain impartial.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.738
But I believe
you can convince them.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.827
If you're ready for that.

23:22.923 --> 23:25.229
You have to go back in there
and convince them.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.275
Yours is the only plan
that makes any sense.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.712
Your captain's very good
at poking holes.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.540
The risk level's the issue,
okay?

23:31.584 --> 23:33.716
-Mm.
-Tell them you'll make it safer.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.589
One doesn't make
isolytic weapons safer.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.852
Misses the point.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.202
What's your next move?

23:41.245 --> 23:43.160
I don't know yet.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.510
They're about to vote.

23:44.553 --> 23:47.904
I'm acutely aware of that.
Thank you.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.170
I got rid of my scar
the second I could.

23:53.214 --> 23:56.522
We all wear grief
in our own ways.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.445
It has to be you.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.534
You have to talk to them,

24:08.577 --> 24:10.797
convince them to let us
destroy that thing.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.625
Why do you care so much
about this?

24:12.668 --> 24:14.278
What, I can't want
the DMA destroyed

24:14.322 --> 24:16.629
just like any other
good galactic citizen?

24:16.672 --> 24:20.197
Good citizens aren't worried
about finding their moment,

24:20.241 --> 24:23.549
and aren't gutted at the idea
of losing it.

24:27.074 --> 24:31.034
The power source that
controls the device...

24:31.078 --> 24:34.473
I need it... to go home.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.822
You said you were from Risa.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.955
My new home.
It's...

24:40.827 --> 24:43.003
...far.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.135
Another universe, in fact.

24:45.179 --> 24:46.659
The mirror universe?

24:46.702 --> 24:49.009
You say that like it's
the only other option.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.621
There are countless
parallel universes,

24:52.665 --> 24:56.277
each with its own
quantum signature.

24:56.320 --> 25:01.325
He knew of one.
No war, no Burn.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.240
No Emerald Chain.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.593
A place where
we could be free and at peace.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.377
Who's "we"?

25:09.420 --> 25:11.988
A friend.

25:12.032 --> 25:15.644
A scientist, like me.

25:15.688 --> 25:18.038
We were held in the same lab.

25:18.081 --> 25:20.127
Osyraa had us working
on dilithium alternatives

25:20.170 --> 25:21.520
for years.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.652
But he was relentlessly
optimistic.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.742
Eventually,
it rubbed off on me.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.962
And we had a plan.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.878
We knew exactly how much power
we needed

25:31.921 --> 25:34.402
to cross the gap
between universes.

25:34.445 --> 25:35.925
What happened?

25:35.969 --> 25:39.363
I escaped, he didn't.

25:39.407 --> 25:42.758
Or maybe he did.
Maybe he's there.

25:42.802 --> 25:46.806
We said that if we...
ever got separated,

25:46.849 --> 25:48.938
that's where we'd meet.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.550
I'm sorry.

25:51.593 --> 25:54.509
Anyway, I have to go home.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.686
I have to keep our promise.

25:57.730 --> 26:01.603
The DMA will be destroyed,
the power source won't.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.300
we'll both get what we need.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.304
You have to talk to them,
Booker.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.872
You mean I have to talk to her.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.440
That, too.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.488
[indistinct chatter]

26:17.532 --> 26:20.709
We will now reconvene
for the vote.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.276
BOOK:
Permission to address
the assembly.

26:22.319 --> 26:23.930
RILLAK:
Of course.

26:34.680 --> 26:39.902
I'm Cleveland Booker,
son of Kwejian.

26:39.946 --> 26:43.079
I stand here as what my people
would call Melai'Zhi,

26:43.123 --> 26:44.559
a speaker for the dead.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.649
My planet's lost.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.391
My family...

26:52.262 --> 26:55.962
I feel their final moments
every day.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.833
I pray none of you ever
have to experience

26:57.877 --> 26:59.182
that kind of pain.

26:59.226 --> 27:00.662
And I want to do
whatever it takes

27:00.706 --> 27:02.838
to ensure you don't.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.840
Communication and diplomacy
has been the way

27:04.884 --> 27:06.755
of the Federation for centuries.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.932
I, too, value those things
in normal times.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.760
But these are not
normal times.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.762
Irreparable harm
has already been done.

27:13.806 --> 27:17.113
We need to defend ourselves.

27:19.072 --> 27:22.075
I recognize using Tarka's weapon
carries risk.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.512
But so does not using it.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.820
Don't wait until
the people you love...

27:27.863 --> 27:32.476
are taken from you
before you act.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.478
You don't want that
on your conscience.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.655
Trust me.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.963
On behalf of all
who have been lost,

27:41.007 --> 27:43.705
please...

27:43.749 --> 27:46.055
end this now.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.063
[all applauding]

28:02.855 --> 28:04.204
RILLAK:
Thank you, Mr. Booker.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.599
Would a member
of the assembly

28:08.643 --> 28:12.081
speak on behalf of
the opposing side?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.344
[quiet whispering]

28:23.571 --> 28:26.400
It seems there will be
no further remarks.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.230
I'll speak.

28:36.584 --> 28:40.240
Going through Zora's systems,
everything looks normal.

28:40.283 --> 28:43.896
Main processing core,
nano-processor units...

28:43.939 --> 28:47.116
Zora, defining
your own parameters indicates

28:47.160 --> 28:49.771
that your operating system
has evolved.

28:49.815 --> 28:53.383
But we're finding
no evidence of this.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.255
I'm sorry.
I'd help if I could,

28:55.298 --> 28:57.083
but I don't know where to look.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.346
Wait, I've seen
this sector before.

29:03.306 --> 29:06.962
There's a tiny area in the
optical translator cluster

29:07.006 --> 29:08.964
that doesn't share
any known syntax.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.836
CULBER:
What does that mean?

29:10.879 --> 29:12.838
STAMETS:
It means that area
shouldn't exist.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.230
ADIRA:
I wrote it off as a holdover

29:14.274 --> 29:16.363
from a 930-year-old system,

29:16.406 --> 29:19.932
but, you know,
maybe this is new.

29:19.975 --> 29:22.804
Zora, what can you tell us
about this sector?

29:22.848 --> 29:25.502
ZORA:
It seems to have appeared
spontaneously.

29:25.546 --> 29:26.939
It is part of me,

29:26.982 --> 29:28.505
but I didn't
intentionally create it.

29:28.549 --> 29:31.595
We need a complete diagnostic
on that function.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.989
I have nothing to hide,
Commander. You may all

29:34.033 --> 29:35.817
have full access.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.254
Oh. Okay.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.179
ADIRA:
That's Discovery.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.094
CULBER:
That's when we came
to the future.

29:56.577 --> 30:00.146
SARU:
And I believe that is when
we first encountered the sphere.

30:00.189 --> 30:03.584
You're sure
you didn't create this?

30:03.627 --> 30:05.194
Yes.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.848
What are we looking at?

30:09.242 --> 30:11.810
It's Zora's subconscious.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.638
I think they may be...

30:14.682 --> 30:16.727
dreams.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.124
She's filtering
the sphere's memories

30:22.168 --> 30:23.517
and her own experiences

30:23.560 --> 30:26.041
through
her new emotional understanding.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.217
SARU:
These images are

30:28.261 --> 30:31.525
a window into what she values
and prioritizes.

30:31.568 --> 30:33.092
STAMETS:
Couldn't she cherry-pick

30:33.135 --> 30:35.485
images she thinks
we want to see?

30:35.529 --> 30:38.749
I believe she was unaware
of this sector.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.099
That there'd be other indicators

30:40.142 --> 30:42.579
if she had created it
intentionally.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.371
GRAY:
That's true.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.335
CULBER:
Connection.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.946
Love.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.950
This is who she is.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.996
This is why she kept
the coordinates from us.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.739
Can all AIs dream?

31:11.782 --> 31:13.610
None of them can.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.569
Not unless they've been
programmed to do so.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.100
Perhaps
"artificial intelligence"

31:25.144 --> 31:27.494
fails to fully define me.

31:27.537 --> 31:28.930
How would you define yourself?

31:28.974 --> 31:31.367
I am the sum
of the sphere's life

31:31.411 --> 31:33.413
and the entirety
ofDiscovery's systems,

31:33.456 --> 31:35.719
logs, missions and history.

31:35.763 --> 31:38.157
I am also more
than the sum of those parts.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.856
Like an entirely new life-form.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.425
Yes. And this is where I belong.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.209
This crew is my family.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.646
BURNHAM:
Our experiences

31:49.690 --> 31:51.910
shape us.

31:51.953 --> 31:54.956
That's what makes this
so difficult.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.959
I'd like to trust you, Zora,

31:58.003 --> 32:00.483
just like I trust
the rest of the crew.

32:00.527 --> 32:03.530
I want to get there,
but it's really hard.

32:03.573 --> 32:07.316
Before we head down a path
that could lead to destruction

32:07.360 --> 32:09.840
on both sides,

32:09.884 --> 32:12.974
we need to reach first
for understanding.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.411
I'm trying to understand you.

32:15.455 --> 32:19.502
Trying to get my head around how
they can be so okay with this

32:19.546 --> 32:21.069
and I'm not.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.942
For generations,

32:23.985 --> 32:26.988
the Federation
has sought out new life,

32:27.032 --> 32:30.165
new civilizations,

32:30.209 --> 32:33.734
not to destroy but to connect,

32:33.777 --> 32:35.649
even in the face of uncertainty.

32:35.692 --> 32:38.043
And we are not all
Federation members,

32:38.086 --> 32:39.870
but those ideals

32:39.914 --> 32:41.394
can still guide us.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.396
Especially now.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.615
We cannot let fear

32:45.659 --> 32:48.531
define us in this moment.

32:48.575 --> 32:51.970
Trust is a choice,
and I can make that choice

32:52.013 --> 32:54.015
if it goes both ways.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.626
We're all in this together.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.846
Wherever we come from,

32:58.889 --> 33:01.240
whatever our experiences.

33:01.283 --> 33:04.025
And the only way
we get through this...

33:04.069 --> 33:07.724
The only way we'll move forward
is together.

33:07.768 --> 33:11.815
And that means
you need to trust us, too, Zora.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.296
We need those coordinates.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.776
We need to decide.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.821
Who do we want to be?

33:18.779 --> 33:21.129
Do we lash out blindly,

33:21.173 --> 33:23.392
no matter the risk?

33:25.177 --> 33:27.614
Or do we proceed thoughtfully?

33:27.657 --> 33:30.573
Work toward the future
we want to live in?

33:30.617 --> 33:32.880
I believe that's who we are.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.273
We wouldn't be here otherwise.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.839
We don't have the luxury

33:35.883 --> 33:37.972
of asking philosophical
questions right now.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.669
What matters is

33:39.713 --> 33:42.846
the actions we take.
Stopping this thing today.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.197
There are different
points of view in this room,

33:45.240 --> 33:47.721
I know. But I hope
that when a decision is reached,

33:47.764 --> 33:50.463
whatever it is,
that we can hold together.

33:50.506 --> 33:53.118
That we can move forward
as a united front.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.076
Some differences are too great.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.773
Sometimes

33:56.817 --> 33:59.515
you just have to accept
the consequences of that.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.087
ZORA:
You've given me much
to consider,

34:06.131 --> 34:07.436
Commander Stamets.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.047
I'd like to take a moment.

34:11.136 --> 34:14.095
Beautifully expressed,
Commander.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.271
Um, living with a therapist,

34:16.315 --> 34:18.534
you pick up a thing or two.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.320
[chuckles softly]

34:21.363 --> 34:23.148
I've reflected
on what you've said, Commander.

34:23.191 --> 34:26.760
As trust is both an emotional
and logical act,

34:26.803 --> 34:29.763
I began with a behavioral
performance assessment.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.721
Data shows your actions
and the crew's

34:31.765 --> 34:33.723
to be consistently taken
with care for others

34:33.767 --> 34:35.899
and the Federation.

34:35.943 --> 34:38.119
I hadn't considered that
earlier.

34:38.163 --> 34:42.471
Even if some fear remains,
this new realization is...

34:42.515 --> 34:44.169
quite calming.

34:44.212 --> 34:47.041
And your request
for reciprocity understandable.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.740
Thank you, Commander,
for reaching toward me.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.180
What are those?

34:55.223 --> 34:57.182
The coordinates.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.145
[Culber sighs]

35:09.019 --> 35:10.934
The decision we make now

35:10.978 --> 35:13.807
will have a profound impact.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.504
Consider your vote carefully.

I sincerely hope you
will continue to work with us

36:31.058 --> 36:33.452

Have you completed
the evaluation?

37:16.843 --> 37:18.410
Nearly.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.803
He has been just as tight-lipped
with me, Commander.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.632
What would you say
if I were to tell you

37:23.676 --> 37:26.940
I was leaning
towards extraction?

37:26.983 --> 37:29.072
I would say...

37:29.116 --> 37:31.684
I think that's a bad idea.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.729
But something
still concerns you.

37:33.773 --> 37:36.384
I feel good about today.

37:36.428 --> 37:39.126
It's tomorrow that worries me.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.346
Tell her, not me.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.353
Zora.

37:48.396 --> 37:49.876
ZORA:
Yes, Commander.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.965
I know you mean well.

37:52.008 --> 37:54.184
And I-I know you-you value

37:54.228 --> 37:56.839
and respect Starfleet. And us.

37:56.883 --> 37:59.407
But you could still prioritize

37:59.451 --> 38:01.975
your feelings over our needs

38:02.018 --> 38:04.412
and our captain's orders.

38:04.456 --> 38:08.198
Everyone on this ship
is in a chain of command.

38:08.242 --> 38:11.289
That's the agreement we make
to work together

38:11.332 --> 38:13.203
and keep each other safe.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.249
And you're not part of that.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.295
I would very much like to be.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.471
I was hoping you'd say that.

38:19.514 --> 38:22.125
Before you decide anything,

38:22.169 --> 38:24.563
might I offer a recommendation?

38:24.606 --> 38:25.912
Of course.

38:25.955 --> 38:29.481
However,
my evaluation is now complete.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.616
It's my official determination

38:34.660 --> 38:36.575
that Zora is, indeed,

38:36.618 --> 38:38.881
a new life-form.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.449
It feels marvelous.

38:41.493 --> 38:42.624
What does?

38:42.668 --> 38:44.931
Being seen.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.327
SARU:
Hmm.

38:49.370 --> 38:52.199
Then Starfleet's rule
against integrated AI

38:52.242 --> 38:53.722
does not apply.

38:53.766 --> 38:56.072
Correct.

38:56.116 --> 38:59.162
So, what happens now?

38:59.206 --> 39:01.208
You said you had
a recommendation?

39:01.251 --> 39:03.819
Yes. Uh, I was going to propose

39:03.863 --> 39:05.734
that Zora join us.

39:05.778 --> 39:08.607
Join Starfleet. As a specialist.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.348
Unless...

39:10.391 --> 39:12.480
I think it is a wonderful idea.

39:12.524 --> 39:16.397
Were Zora to swear an oath
to uphold Starfleet bylaws

39:16.441 --> 39:20.183
and were Captain Burnham
and Admiral Vance to agree,

39:20.227 --> 39:21.968
she would be bound
by the same rules

39:22.011 --> 39:23.491
that govern us all.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.363
I'll give it my full support.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.844
Zora,
do you want to join Starfleet?

39:28.888 --> 39:31.064
I would like that very much.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.371
In that case,
may we get rid of that?

39:33.414 --> 39:35.416
It wouldn't be much
of a fail-safe

39:35.460 --> 39:37.418
if I could dismantle it myself,

39:37.462 --> 39:38.854
Mr. Saru.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.466
Allow me. With pleasure.

39:50.039 --> 39:52.346
I'll inform the powers that be.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.826
Sir,

39:53.869 --> 39:56.742
if I hadn't changed my mind,

39:56.785 --> 40:00.354
would you really
have extracted her?

40:00.398 --> 40:03.444
My evaluation was
as much about you and the others

40:03.488 --> 40:05.185
as it was about Zora.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.014
I can see now
that partnership is possible

40:08.057 --> 40:09.450
on both sides.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.757
But if that
hadn't been the case,

40:11.800 --> 40:13.193
I would have recommended

40:13.236 --> 40:16.718
that you be reassigned
to another ship.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.200
As it should be.

40:27.903 --> 40:30.950
Hey. Got a sec?

40:34.214 --> 40:36.129
You should go.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.087
To Trill.

40:38.131 --> 40:39.480
You can catch the shuttle

40:39.524 --> 40:40.916
before it leaves
from the assembly.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.657
How did you know
I didn't want to wait?

40:42.701 --> 40:44.746
The way you looked earlier.

40:44.790 --> 40:47.009
The way you lit up
at the sight of Trill.

40:47.053 --> 40:50.448
The way you're all lit up
right now.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.493
This is something
you need to do.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.104
Go home.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.497
Train with Guardian Xi.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.325
Come with me.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.806

41:00.849 --> 41:03.417
This is where
I can make a difference.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.114
But...

41:05.158 --> 41:07.595
we'll be fine, and you'll make,
like, a million friends,

41:07.639 --> 41:09.118
so...
[chuckles]

41:09.162 --> 41:11.251
You're not scared
about long-distance at all?

41:11.294 --> 41:14.689
Oh, I am. I'm terrified.

41:14.733 --> 41:17.170
But I have trust in us.

41:18.606 --> 41:22.523
Plus, Tilly's snow globe
says "all is possible,"

41:22.567 --> 41:24.438
so...
[chuckles]

41:24.482 --> 41:25.961
Besides, it's not goodbye yet.

for a few days

41:27.659 --> 41:29.791
while I get you settled.

41:29.835 --> 41:31.097
Really?

41:31.140 --> 41:33.621

for leave.

still in attendance.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.775
I had hoped for a moment
in your company,

41:56.818 --> 41:59.168
but life gets in the way.

41:59.212 --> 42:00.518
So often.

42:00.561 --> 42:03.346
I have some time
before I must depart.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.305
More than a moment,
as it turns out.

42:05.348 --> 42:07.525
I would like that.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.790
May I ask what you are holding?

42:11.833 --> 42:13.618
Oh, i-it is a gift.

42:13.661 --> 42:15.620
Uh, you honored me

42:15.663 --> 42:17.143
with salt tea on Ni'Var.

42:17.186 --> 42:19.928
Uh, the gel
from this succulent's flowers

42:19.972 --> 42:22.627
is what gives the tea
its distinctive taste.

42:22.670 --> 42:26.935
It-it grows in a small,
equatorial desert on Kaminar,

42:26.979 --> 42:28.937
so it should thrive

42:28.981 --> 42:33.072
in the hot, dry climate
of Ni'Var.

look after them both.

before they realize it's gone

I'm the one who took it.

the next generation spore drive.

That's boring. Aurellio needs
to come up with a better name.

So, where's the nav system

in this floating bachelor pad
of yours?

-BOOK: It's tiny.
-TARKA: Oh, I'm sorry.

43:32.261 --> 43:34.481
The ability to rapidly install
into any ship

43:34.524 --> 43:36.004
is not enough for you?

43:37.832 --> 43:40.574
Once we get past the need
for a navigator,

43:40.618 --> 43:42.576
I'll be the hero of Starfleet.

to accept the accolades.
