RuPaul: Previously on RuPaul's
Secret Celebrity Drag Race...

00:15.616 --> 00:18.051
Nine celebrities left behind
their famous identities

00:18.051 --> 00:22.322
to experience
the miracle of drag.

00:22.322 --> 00:26.627
They competed
in a lip sync extravaganza.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.061
I loved every second of that.

This week the race heats up.

01:15.976 --> 01:19.880
Category is Dance
Your Padded Asses Off.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.081
It's a dance challenge,

01:21.081 --> 01:23.450
so all eyes are
going to be on you now.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.520
You look so upset, like
you don't even want to be here.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.189
The choreography
is definitely more challenging.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.024
You've set the bar
so high for yourself,

01:31.024 --> 01:32.492
we're going to have
to shoot above that.

01:32.492 --> 01:33.727
It's feeling harder
than week one.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.897
I've seen someone go home,
so this is real.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.266
The stakes are through
the mother-tucking roof.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.935

And it all starts in five...

01:41.935 --> 01:43.370

I wanna marry it.

Now, last week these ladykins
left us gagging for more,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.468

we challenged our queens

03:55.502 --> 03:57.737
-Oh, come on.
-Stunning.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.573
You know,
I've spent six hours

03:59.573 --> 04:01.408
to get this gorgeous.

any behind the scenes tea
I need to know about?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.557
Okay. Brooke Lynn Hytes is
wearing pants under this dress.

04:17.557 --> 04:21.161
[all laugh]

04:21.161 --> 04:24.731
Well, Ru, I've taken it
upon myself this week

04:24.731 --> 04:26.399
to teach some of our
celebrities about tucking.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.101
Oh.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.269
And it's been a handful.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.204
I bet.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.539
And sometimes two.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.107
[all laugh]

04:34.107 --> 04:35.842
You know,
after last week's elimination,

04:35.842 --> 04:39.012
the stakes are through
the mother-tucking roof.

04:39.012 --> 04:42.682
And as a highly seasoned
dancer myself...

04:42.682 --> 04:44.784
[all laugh]

04:44.784 --> 04:46.920
That's me.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.788
I've made sure and speak
to all the queens

04:48.788 --> 04:50.857
and tell them
to move it or lose it.

04:50.857 --> 04:55.061
This week each queen
chose an iconic dance number,

04:55.061 --> 04:56.196
and they were challenged

04:56.196 --> 04:58.231
to shake it
like a Polaroid picture.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.567
What's a Polaroid?

05:00.567 --> 05:01.568
I'm not actually sure.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.538
Let's ask the oldest queen.
Jujubee?

05:04.538 --> 05:05.605
-Oh.
-Oh.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.441
Mama Ru,
what's a Polaroid?

05:08.441 --> 05:09.676
Michelle?

05:09.676 --> 05:12.612
[all laugh]

05:14.948 --> 05:16.950
Okay, now up first, a queen

05:16.950 --> 05:18.552
who thinks
she's got what it takes

05:18.552 --> 05:20.654
to get this
cha-cha party started.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.156
Ladies, one, two...

05:23.156 --> 05:25.325
All: Cha-cha, bitch!

05:25.325 --> 05:27.527
[cheers and applause]

05:27.527 --> 05:30.130
-Oh.
-How are you today?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.532
-You look great.
-You, too.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.134
After last week's
performance,

05:34.134 --> 05:35.268
I feel like
I did a great job,

05:35.268 --> 05:36.736
meaning I totally blacked out,

05:36.736 --> 05:38.805
and usually if I, like,
black out on stage,

05:38.805 --> 05:40.407
that means I was really in it.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.443
[all laugh]

05:43.443 --> 05:45.745
But now I've set
a precedent for myself,

05:45.745 --> 05:47.514
and you can only beat yourself.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.383
You went out there
and you just nailed it.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.219
And the judges loved you.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.821
Michelle Visage
noticed you were a dancer.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.090
This week,
it's a dance challenge.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.625
-Yeah.
-So everyone--

05:58.625 --> 06:00.694
all eyes
are going to be on you now.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.262
-How do you feel?
-Sore.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.998
The calves are sore,
the feet are sore.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.601
Last week the heels
were very uncomfortable.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.769
Going forward, I need to
push through the pain.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.572
So for this week,
I'll be serving up JLo vibes

06:12.572 --> 06:13.807
at the salsa club.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.542
Because it's a dance week,
I wanted a song

06:15.542 --> 06:17.510
that everybody
wants to dance to.

06:17.510 --> 06:21.248
I think this artist
is absolutely incredible.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.650
So Chic-Li-Fay needs
to embody what she does,

06:23.650 --> 06:25.151
which is being sexy.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.621
I'm still learning
who Chic-Li-Fay is,

06:27.621 --> 06:29.956
and it's hard
because it is almost

06:29.956 --> 06:33.460
like getting deeper
into whatever part of myself

06:33.460 --> 06:35.128
that I haven't gotten
to express.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.097
It's hard for me
to, like, be sexy.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.732
Why? You're sexy.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.034
You know,
I tend to just go comedy.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.869
You have to discover
a new side of you.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.170
I don't know
what's going to happen,

06:44.170 --> 06:45.705
but I do know that Chic-Li-Fay

06:45.705 --> 06:48.308
will be dancing her ass off.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.744
This week, Chic-Li-Fay
will be two breasts,

06:50.744 --> 06:53.179
all the buns, extra pickles.

06:53.179 --> 06:56.650
[cheers and applause]

06:56.650 --> 06:58.752

Honey, you have

08:49.596 --> 08:51.564
the best coaches
in the world back there,

08:51.564 --> 08:54.033
because those hips do not lie.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.502
[cheers and applause]

08:55.502 --> 08:56.536
We found out last week

08:56.536 --> 08:57.670
that you are
an incredible dancer.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.339
And here's the thing about you.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.174
I think that inside your heart,

09:01.174 --> 09:02.709
you think
that you're a comedy queen.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.311
You're not.
You're a performance queen

09:05.311 --> 09:07.414
who just happens to have
a great sense of humor.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.582
-So that's what it is.
-Yes, yeah.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.251
You don't have
to make excuses

09:11.251 --> 09:13.553
for being so damn hot, okay?

09:15.822 --> 09:19.325
And the Pitbull to my JLo,
Ross Mathews.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.394
[all laugh]
Golly.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.196
You know, I'm not
exactly a boob man,

09:23.196 --> 09:24.831
but hello and hello.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.366
[all laugh]

09:26.366 --> 09:28.067
You know, here's the deal,
and I say this

09:28.067 --> 09:29.969
as someone who's very sexy,

09:29.969 --> 09:32.705
but you have to have
a confidence to pull it off.

09:32.705 --> 09:36.009
You look like
you were meant to do that.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.111
Keep that up
in every single challenge,

09:38.111 --> 09:40.313
we might see you
at the end of this whole thing.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.183
[cheers and applause]

09:43.183 --> 09:44.617
You know, you were excellent.

09:44.617 --> 09:47.420
There is a tendency
to sort of go wonk-wonk,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.490
you know, because
this level of sexuality,

09:50.490 --> 09:53.193
it feels like
it must be new to you.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.395
Exactly.
You guys are reading me.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.963
[all laugh]

09:56.963 --> 09:58.364
Well, Chic-Li-Fay,

09:58.364 --> 10:00.800
I have one word
to say to you:

10:00.800 --> 10:02.569
escándalo!

10:02.569 --> 10:05.438

There's my diva.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.141
Hi, gorgeous.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.143
Last week you were in
the bottom three,

10:44.143 --> 10:46.179
which is a little terrifying.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.180
It was so terrifying.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.515
So terrifying.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.383
Electra Owl.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.151
There were a few lyrics
that got dropped.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.522
We want to see you fly higher.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.990
There's a difficulty here

10:56.990 --> 10:58.224
where you're actually
lip syncing.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.260
You're not actually singing
and performing,

11:00.260 --> 11:01.461
which is what I do.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.397
For me, that was
far more daunting. [laughs]

11:04.397 --> 11:06.366
They've had their talons
in me, the judges.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.269
And now I don't wanna
be shred apart.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.703
Is that the movements
or is it the face or what?

11:10.703 --> 11:12.105
It's everything.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.339
You have to go
over the top

11:13.339 --> 11:15.341
of what you think
you need to do.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.743
-Yo, yo, yo.
-Oh.

11:16.743 --> 11:19.279
This was so new and foreign,
like, doing a lip sync.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.313
It's a lot of learning.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.049
There's a lot
of challenges here.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.284
I love the seventies,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.886
so I chose a song
that's disco.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.388
It's all about the dancing.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.624
The era, the time of disco
and Solid Gold.

11:31.624 --> 11:32.992
You know what I mean?

11:32.992 --> 11:34.260
So that's what
we wanna bring

11:34.260 --> 11:36.329
is just like
the nostalgia of it, right?

11:36.329 --> 11:38.364
And even when you were
just doing those arm movements,

11:38.364 --> 11:41.434
that's the excitement
and energy I'm looking for.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.236
Electra gotta be electric.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.071
There we go.
There we go.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.407
I am just
really concentrating

11:47.407 --> 11:50.343
on my routine
and lip syncing.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.111
And I certainly
don't wanna let Ru down.

11:52.111 --> 11:55.748
I'm gonna Electra Owl
that stage and kick ass.

Well, hello, disco lady.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.398
Hi.

13:52.398 --> 13:55.535
Let's hear from our judges.

13:55.535 --> 13:59.005
Direct from Studio 50-whore,

13:59.005 --> 14:01.474
it's Michelle Visage.

14:01.474 --> 14:05.678
Yes! Electra, first of all,

14:05.678 --> 14:08.748
so much better this week
with the lip sync.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.917
Really, really improved.

14:10.917 --> 14:13.619
But I see
a little bit of trepidation.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.188
I see a little bit of
what if I don't remember it?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.322
Or do I have it here?

14:16.322 --> 14:17.957
You gave in to the lip sync,
and you did it.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.058
Now give in

14:19.058 --> 14:21.060
to the performance aspect
of it, the dance.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.262
All the stuff maybe
you're not used to doing,

14:23.262 --> 14:24.764
do it.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.632
Disc-O-M-G, honey.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.234
[all laugh]

14:28.234 --> 14:32.004
You look like a disco ball
and a dress had a baby.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.573
[all laugh]

14:33.573 --> 14:35.942
I get what Michelle is saying.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.977
I want you to perform
for the back of the room,

14:37.977 --> 14:39.946
because you are painted
for the back of the room.

14:39.946 --> 14:42.448
So make sure everything's
just a little exaggerated

14:42.448 --> 14:44.217
when you're doing
your lip syncing

14:44.217 --> 14:45.885
so we can see
that you know those words.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.088
What I feel
is burning inside of you,

14:49.088 --> 14:50.923
light that match, honey.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.759
Thank you.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.961
You look so gorgeous.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.763
Now, is there anything
holding you back?

14:56.763 --> 14:58.064
Shoes. Nails.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.699
Yeah.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.235
-Girdle. You want me to...
-Yeah. Oh.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.269
Well, it's the story
of my life.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.737
Story of your life.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.905
Yeah, absolutely.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.340
What was your biggest
challenge this week?

15:07.340 --> 15:08.708
Letting go.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.410
Making sure you're
engaging with the dancers

15:11.410 --> 15:12.411
and really having fun.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.412
Always get out of your head.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.148
How is your head?

15:15.148 --> 15:17.416
[all laugh]

15:17.416 --> 15:20.319
My head's fabulous.
Thank you for asking.

15:20.319 --> 15:24.223
Give it up for
our disco diva Electra Owl.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.026
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

15:27.026 --> 15:30.630
When it comes to our next
queen, the thirst is real.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.631
Take a look.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.933
[cheers and applause]

15:33.933 --> 15:36.569
My first week as a drag queen
was a whirlwind.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.871
I mean, drag is hard,
but I feel good

15:38.871 --> 15:41.841
about my performance
last week all in all.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.376
Don't forget
that we're out here.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.610
You got so into it

15:44.610 --> 15:46.679
that we lost your face
some of the time.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.216
Tap into the power
of Thirsty Von Trap.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.886
Michelle told me to connect
with the audience a bit more,

15:53.886 --> 15:56.189
and I'm definitely
going to apply that

15:56.189 --> 15:57.957
to this week's performance.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.427
I want to first tell you

16:01.427 --> 16:03.062
I was so proud
of the work that you did.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.231
I think the big note
that I'm hearing,

16:05.231 --> 16:07.733
they wanna feel that energy
and that intensity

16:07.733 --> 16:09.802
that is inside
of Thirsty right here.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.437
I think that Thirsty
is giving me

16:11.437 --> 16:13.873
a lesson in self confidence
that I know is there,

16:13.873 --> 16:16.676
but I don't get to access
as much out of drag.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.211
It's Dance Your Padded Ass Off.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.147
This week, we're just gonna
take it to the next level.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.316
That's just a matter
of just letting go,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.751
feeling loose, and performing.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.253
Obviously a week
that's all about dancing,

16:27.253 --> 16:28.621
I had to go with disco.

16:28.621 --> 16:32.158
I'm going for a modern take
on Saturday Night Fever.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.492
In just the choreography,

16:33.492 --> 16:34.594
I'm kind of
moving around the stage,

16:34.594 --> 16:35.895
connecting with the audience.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.163
I'm really excited about this.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.631
One thing
that you're still doing.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.199
You look so upset,

16:40.199 --> 16:41.767
like, you don't even
wanna be here.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.502
You can be sexy and smolder,

16:43.502 --> 16:45.404
but still have just, like,
just like a little smirk.

16:45.404 --> 16:48.474
I wanna show as many sides
to Thirsty as I possibly can,

16:48.474 --> 16:51.477
and so I'm serving huge hair.

16:51.477 --> 16:54.180
It's giving sequined
thigh-high boots.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.316
I'm sparkling from
legitimately head to toe.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.619
Thirsty is coming out here

16:59.619 --> 17:02.688
giving you full
disco diva realness,

17:02.688 --> 17:04.357

you weren't, you played it off.

is just go a little further,

going the extra mile.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.693

they put all that ass

a little bit like this.

The first time I put them on,
like, my chin hit the floor.

19:35.908 --> 19:39.678
Yes, but the hair
actually balances it off.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.981

looking to the side

19:48.120 --> 19:49.955
to see if you were doing
the thing with the dancers,

19:49.955 --> 19:51.791
The skirt and the reveal

19:51.791 --> 19:54.126
was something
that was just, um,

19:54.126 --> 19:56.128
that was just
a little bit difficult.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.329
Yeah, yeah.

19:57.329 --> 20:00.999
Monét X Change
is your queen supreme.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.535
What advice did
she have for you this week?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.036
When she was
watching my rehearsals,

20:04.036 --> 20:06.005
she's, like,
girl, why you look so mad?

20:06.005 --> 20:08.707
And I didn't realize
that I did.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.609
I was just
kind of laser focused.

20:10.609 --> 20:11.777
I think that
that was the biggest advice

20:11.777 --> 20:14.213
that she gave me
that I'm really grateful for.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.214
All right.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.116
Give it up
for Thirsty Von Trap.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.684
Thank you, guys.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.220
[cheers and applause]

20:21.220 --> 20:22.588
Michelle, have you
ever had trouble

20:22.588 --> 20:24.423
taking your skirt off
in public?

20:24.423 --> 20:26.325
Never had any trouble.
It just comes--

20:26.325 --> 20:27.726
It actually just
falls off by itself.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.428
Yeah, actually I feel stupid
asking that question.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.863
Thank you. I mean,
you're talking about me here.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.647
[cheers and applause]

20:50.449 --> 20:52.585
Hello.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.054
Is that Milli?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.590
Last week you were fantastic.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.994
I was thrilled that the judges
had such positive feedback.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.263
Everything was seamless.
It looked easy.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.599
But now I really
want to showcase

21:06.599 --> 21:09.201
storytelling in my performance.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.669
This week I'm doing
Dancing On My Own

21:10.669 --> 21:16.408
and my drag mentor created
this iconic lip sync number,

21:16.408 --> 21:18.244
this very number that sets up

21:18.244 --> 21:21.347
a really high bar
for me to live up to.

21:21.347 --> 21:24.550
I learned that drag
is so much of an art form

21:24.550 --> 21:26.652
where you're able
to tell a story,

21:26.652 --> 21:30.456
so I really want
to showcase the storytelling

21:30.456 --> 21:31.824
through my dancing.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.825
What are we doing?

21:32.825 --> 21:34.793
I thought since
I just got married,

21:34.793 --> 21:36.729
I was very lucky.
He showed up at the altar.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.097
Everybody's nervous about that.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.565
That's a start.

21:39.565 --> 21:40.833
So what if we played
with the opposite?

21:40.833 --> 21:41.867
All right. I love it.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.737
Yeah!

21:47.940 --> 21:50.242
You said you wanted
to make it humorous.

21:50.242 --> 21:53.512
I found it
so beautifully emotional.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.147
If it came off
more genuine to you,

21:55.147 --> 21:56.415
I think
that's how we play it.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.884
This actually really
changes my performance.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.519
Definitely something
that makes me nervous.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.721
It just makes me
want to bring it even more.

22:02.721 --> 22:05.157
It's this connection
we both have to this song.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.026
I'm getting chills
talking about it.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.229
I wanna use my dancing
to tell a story.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.599
Milli this week
is ready to nail it.

Milli Von Sunshine.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.442
-Hi, Ru.
-Wow.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.644
[laughs]

24:05.644 --> 24:09.081
Oh, my God, that was so good,
I wanna marry it.

24:09.081 --> 24:13.319
Milli, that whole thing
was a serve, darling.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.622
[cheers and applause]

24:16.622 --> 24:17.990
Thank you.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.959
I loved the storytelling
that we got from that,

24:20.959 --> 24:22.928
a beginning,
a middle, and an end,

24:22.928 --> 24:25.230
and the story was totally
my life, like, so relatable.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.765
[all laugh]

24:26.765 --> 24:28.233
-Me, too.
-Yes, sister.

24:28.233 --> 24:29.635
It is relatable.

24:29.635 --> 24:33.105
I love the whole Elvis drag
that you have going on.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.573
I'm getting more and more
excited to see

24:34.573 --> 24:36.675
what you're gonna be doing,
and this storytelling aspect

24:36.675 --> 24:41.213
was so theatrical and so good
and so fun and so well done.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.382
Keep it up, Milli.

24:43.382 --> 24:44.717
Thank you.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.051
Yeah.

24:46.051 --> 24:48.053
It's just so smart.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.655
It's so thought out.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.423
When you're doing those
dance moves out there,

24:51.423 --> 24:53.759
if you're not confident
in who you are,

24:53.759 --> 24:55.561
you look like a fool.

24:55.561 --> 24:58.364
You look like
you were meant to do that.

24:58.364 --> 25:01.533
This is how you can approach
this kind of competition

25:01.533 --> 25:03.202
and win the whole thing.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.903
[cheers and applause]

25:04.903 --> 25:06.271
Just like those grooms,

25:06.271 --> 25:08.874
you have to keep
topping yourself, okay?

25:08.874 --> 25:10.075
[all laugh]

25:10.075 --> 25:11.910
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.178
Thank you.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.013
Well, I thought
it was just fantastic.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.249
I love what you can do
with your body.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.551
I love how far you took it.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.054
I see you've got
a little glitter mustache on.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.256
-A glitter-stache.
-A glitter-stache.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.760
I'd be remiss if I didn't
mention Davis the dancer

25:27.760 --> 25:30.162
and his performance
of taking your groom.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.830
-That's right.
-Yes.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.699
There was something extra
about his--

25:33.699 --> 25:36.201
-Let's say bitchy.
-Yeah.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.203
Art imitating life.
Life is imitating art.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.471
I don't know. We'll see.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.541
So Jujubee
is your queen supreme.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.810
Tell me what advice
she had for you this week.

25:44.810 --> 25:48.046
Jujubee really turned this
whole performance around for me.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.281
Earlier on
in the rehearsals,

25:49.281 --> 25:50.716
it was a bit more comedic

25:50.716 --> 25:52.518
and it had a little bit
of a fun element,

25:52.518 --> 25:53.886
which it still did.

25:53.886 --> 25:57.022
But really, finding
those honest and true

25:57.022 --> 25:59.491
and raw moments
just elevates it.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.793
She really helped me with

26:00.793 --> 26:03.462
and really like kind of
cueing on.

26:03.462 --> 26:06.098
Jujubee and Raven

26:06.098 --> 26:08.867
did an iconic lip sync
to this song.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.169
-That's right.
-And tonight,

26:10.169 --> 26:14.006
you have done another
iconic version of this song.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.974
Thank you.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.843
Thank you,
Milli Von Sunshine.

26:17.843 --> 26:19.945
Give her a big round
of applause.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.781

26:22.781 --> 26:24.716

-Didn't see it coming.

26:41.366 --> 26:44.703

Jackie Would?

26:44.703 --> 26:46.071
Take a look.

26:47.673 --> 26:48.674
Jackie Would.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.342
What?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.577
I'm very nervous.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.512
I know what it feels like
to be in the bottom.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.547
Last week
I finished in the bottom two.

26:55.547 --> 26:59.485
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

26:59.485 --> 27:02.120
I know nothing
about choreographed dancing,

27:02.120 --> 27:05.757
and it is very intimidating.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.826
You have to trust yourself.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.995
-You say I can and I will.
-Got it.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.130
-And I would.
-And I would.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.867
Jackie Would,
because this week we're dancing.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.269
You gotta dance
your padded ass off.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.971
Dance is about a feeling,

27:18.971 --> 27:21.707
and less about
the technical side of it.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.041
-Let's do it together.
-Okay.

27:23.041 --> 27:25.444
Five, six, seven, eight.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.813
Pump, pump, pump, pump.

27:27.813 --> 27:28.814
Hey, there we go.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.149
And pump, pump, pump, pump.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.985
This week, the choreography

27:32.985 --> 27:34.820
is definitely
more challenging for Jackie.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.855
It is something
that we have never done

27:36.855 --> 27:38.423
at this level before.

27:38.423 --> 27:40.092
Like, let's do this,
let's do that.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.093
Oh, my God.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.262
Jackie's strong suit
is having fun,

27:43.262 --> 27:45.564
so that's what
I have to lean into.

27:45.564 --> 27:48.901
Jackie's look this week
is over the top exciting.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.870
It's the bubble gum of workout

27:51.870 --> 27:53.939
in a vintage,
kinda old school way.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.808
I'm hoping that
she just calms herself

27:56.808 --> 27:59.511
and just shows
who Jackie Would is,

27:59.511 --> 28:02.347
and that is
a slutty drunk aunt.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.082
[laughs]

28:04.082 --> 28:05.617
The biggest challenge
that I have

28:05.617 --> 28:09.021
is getting on stage
in a choreographed number

28:09.021 --> 28:11.957
and making sure
that I hit all my beats.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.826
I think it's important
to be big-eyed and gung-ho.

28:14.826 --> 28:18.096
Jackie, she definitely
puts the "ho" in gung-ho.

28:18.096 --> 28:20.499

[cheers and applause]

29:56.194 --> 29:57.863
I told her to hold the pose,

29:57.863 --> 29:59.231
and it's gonna be,
like, 20 minutes

29:59.231 --> 30:00.832
before she lets go.

30:00.832 --> 30:02.334
[laughs]

30:10.642 --> 30:13.745
Is there anything
Jackie wouldn't do?

30:13.745 --> 30:15.347
[all laugh]

30:15.347 --> 30:16.848
I just can't think of it.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.283
[all laugh]

30:18.283 --> 30:21.787
Jackie, you are a headband away
from Jackie Stallone.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.155
[all laugh]

30:23.155 --> 30:24.222
First of all, I love

30:24.222 --> 30:25.524
that you incorporated
the sprinkler

30:25.524 --> 30:27.459
into a drag routine.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.761
Yes, we agreed

30:29.761 --> 30:31.496
that that would be
sort of my signature move.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.465
[all laugh]

30:33.465 --> 30:37.436
Listen, we know that you
are rhythmically challenged.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.172
Well, Jackie's not
a classically trained dancer.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.340
No, she's not.
She's not.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.710
But what you lack in rhythm,

30:44.710 --> 30:46.945
you make up for
in stage presence.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.181
And just a little note
on the drag.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.683
Watch the crotch. It gets
lower and lower and lower.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.719
I know, I know, yank it up.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.387
Get it all up there
with everything else,

30:55.387 --> 30:56.588
Yep, yep, yep.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.356
You were so fun
to watch tonight.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.593
Please just go into it.
Go deep into it.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.496
Thank you.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.264
So fun.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.733
This outfit is exactly
what I wore to the gym

31:07.733 --> 31:10.068
both times I went, okay?

31:10.068 --> 31:11.937
It just is so right.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.606
You look exactly
how drag should:

31:14.606 --> 31:17.142
exaggerated, silly, and fun,

31:17.142 --> 31:19.244
and you went there and you
got all the elements here.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.079
You've got the spirit
to do this.

31:21.079 --> 31:22.914
Just really let go.

31:22.914 --> 31:25.016
Thank you. I will.

31:25.016 --> 31:27.419
I'm working on it.

31:27.419 --> 31:32.858
Well, there's Hollywood,
there's Dollywood,

31:32.858 --> 31:35.026
and now there is
Jackie Would.

31:35.026 --> 31:38.396
Yeah.
[cheers and applause]

31:38.396 --> 31:40.499
I thought your performance
was so much fun.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.934
I loved how you had fun
with the dancers.

31:42.934 --> 31:46.671
It was a wink, wink,
nudge, nudge to the eighties.

31:46.671 --> 31:49.441
Now, last week
you lip synced for your life.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.177
How did that inspire
this week's performance?

31:52.177 --> 31:54.012
Well, you know,
what I realized

31:54.012 --> 31:58.150
was that my dancing
is not my forte.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.918
It's not my go to.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.387
And when I was
a little bit more freeform

32:02.387 --> 32:04.656
with the lip sync for my life,

32:04.656 --> 32:07.159
it was a little easier
for me to have those moments

32:07.159 --> 32:08.593
in between where I was

32:08.593 --> 32:10.562
just sort of doing my thing,
if you will.

32:10.562 --> 32:14.032
Are you confident that you
won't be lip syncing tonight?

32:14.032 --> 32:16.401
I think so.
I think I may not.

32:16.401 --> 32:20.205
But I really enjoyed
first and foremost

32:20.205 --> 32:21.773
just actually connecting
with the audience.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.409
And she's so much fun
and I love that about her

32:24.409 --> 32:27.012
and being able
to do all of this.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.780
Yes, yes.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.248
Give it up for Jackie Would.

32:30.248 --> 32:31.483
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.185
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.352
Thank you.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.791
Her voice
is very Joan Rivers.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.927
It's very Joan Rivers.

32:41.927 --> 32:44.029
Yeah, the cracking point.
Yep, yep.

32:54.406 --> 32:59.311
Tonight, category is
Dance Your Padded Ass Off.

32:59.311 --> 33:03.081
Up next,
all eyes on Chakra 7.

33:03.081 --> 33:04.216
Take a look.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.618
[cheers and applause]

33:06.618 --> 33:07.619
Hi, mama.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.454
There is my gorgeous goddess.

33:09.454 --> 33:13.291
Performing in full drag
is a whole different animal.

33:13.291 --> 33:16.061
So you had quite
the drag debut.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.629
It was so much fun.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.798
You were living
your life on that stage,

33:19.798 --> 33:21.900
and you really discovered
your superpower.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.969
This past week,
being in drag

33:23.969 --> 33:26.805
actually helped me
to feel more confident.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.341
Because I have been afraid
to perform in the past.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.109
It's like I can bring out

33:31.109 --> 33:34.079
all of the dopest,
grandest,

33:34.079 --> 33:38.116
the most audacious things
that I think about and dream of.

33:38.116 --> 33:41.253
I really realized
how clean drag is.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.854
This week
is a dance challenge.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.856
Well, let's get
the rehearsal crackin'.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.424
Go one, two--

33:46.424 --> 33:47.792
I chose this song
this week

33:47.792 --> 33:50.362
because it's a song
that I absolutely love.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.298
It's about joy, and it's about,
like, not giving up.

33:53.298 --> 33:55.901
Last week we did
the fierce side of Chakra,

33:55.901 --> 33:59.638
and now this side
is, like, the joy, the love.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.106
I want to show them my heart,

34:01.106 --> 34:03.108
and I hope
it makes people happy.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.277
You were kind of
performing down here.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.311
So when you're walking,

34:06.311 --> 34:07.579
make sure you're
still performing out.

34:07.579 --> 34:08.647
Okay.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.448
It's going harder
than week one,

34:10.448 --> 34:12.684
because now I've seen
someone go home,

34:12.684 --> 34:16.721
someone I totally admire,
and so this is real.

34:16.721 --> 34:20.759
Putting the lashes on,
your hair, your corset,

34:20.759 --> 34:22.961
I feel myself,
like, becoming Chakra.

34:22.961 --> 34:24.763
We're gonna meditate
for you later.

34:24.763 --> 34:25.830
Thank you.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.266
-I'm meditating right now.
-Are you?

34:29.334 --> 34:31.269
Oh, that was good. Whew.

34:31.269 --> 34:32.671
I feel much more centered.

34:32.671 --> 34:38.109
Chakra 7 is gonna

36:26.384 --> 36:28.620
and hear what they have to say.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.122

36:31.122 --> 36:32.924
and radiance
and just happiness,

36:32.924 --> 36:34.325
and I love that about you.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.269
that you look
absolutely beautiful tonight.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.738
You're so much fun to watch.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.941
I can't wait to see
the next level of Chakra.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.677
You know, I needed
that performance today,

36:52.677 --> 36:55.980
because I smiled
from beginning to end.

36:55.980 --> 36:59.517
It was just yummy.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.387
And I love that you didn't
come out here with one dancer

37:02.387 --> 37:04.322
and do this, like,
relationship dance

37:04.322 --> 37:05.390
with somebody who loves you.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.791
You did it
with a community,

37:06.791 --> 37:09.527
and I felt like it was, like,
everybody coming together.

37:09.527 --> 37:12.464
Because I think we all need
a little love right now,

37:12.464 --> 37:14.065
Yeah.
[cheers and applause]

37:14.065 --> 37:16.101
There's something that
you're doing with your energy

37:16.101 --> 37:18.470
and your choice of costumes
and song

37:18.470 --> 37:22.140
that really exudes the remedy

37:22.140 --> 37:26.010
for what we are
living through today.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.679
It really is.

37:27.679 --> 37:32.650
And that big hair and those
eyebrows painted to the ceiling.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.786
[all laugh]
All that paint.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.355
Walk me through
your process this week.

37:37.355 --> 37:40.992
This is one of the first songs
that I ever loved in life,

37:40.992 --> 37:42.760
but that joy and that love

37:42.760 --> 37:44.863
and I think, who wants
to love alone, you know?

37:44.863 --> 37:47.098
She needs--
we need a resurrection.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.435
Yeah.
[cheers and applause]

37:50.435 --> 37:52.170
Just for my own knowledge,

37:52.170 --> 37:55.039
how many wigs do you have
on your head right now?

37:55.039 --> 37:57.242
I think more than one.

37:57.242 --> 37:58.610
Yeah. [laughs]

37:58.610 --> 38:01.146
Well, thank you, Chakra 7.
Thank you so much.

38:01.146 --> 38:02.313
Give it up.

38:02.313 --> 38:05.817

38:07.485 --> 38:09.187
She's like Olivia.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.122
Like, that same energy.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.490
Right.
You know, you're right.

Italians do it better.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.996

-Mwah, mwah.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.638
You really impressed me.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.639
I thought you were
gonna be in the top.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.940
Oh, thank you.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.109
What's the vibe for this week?
It's dance week.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.044
I was
a musical theater student,

38:33.044 --> 38:35.747

a little bit of what I got.

38:37.382 --> 38:38.783

38:38.783 --> 38:40.718
I wanted
to give them a full taste

38:40.718 --> 38:42.687
-of my ethnicity.
-Okay.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.822
And go to like
an Italian vineyard

38:44.822 --> 38:46.391
and take them
on a little journey.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.659
Nice.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.861
I'm tapping into all these
amazing Italian ladies

38:49.861 --> 38:50.895
that I grew up around

38:50.895 --> 38:52.664
and try to see
what I can pull from

38:52.664 --> 38:54.799
to find my strength
in my femininity.

38:54.799 --> 38:56.034
This song,
it's going to be different

38:56.034 --> 38:57.969
than any of the other
contestants tonight.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.104
I'm taking a risk, and hopefully
the audience gets it.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.506
-One, two.
-Oh, I did it again.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.507
Start with the right.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.175
Six, seven, eight.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.777
I'm just so excited
to put on a show,

39:05.777 --> 39:06.778
but little by little,

39:06.778 --> 39:08.980
I'm discovering
new things about me.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.783
Last week I felt
a little self-conscious

39:11.783 --> 39:14.085
about having the lowest heels
in the competition.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.720
Because I'm a larger man,

39:15.720 --> 39:17.855
I need to have
a stronger heel.

39:17.855 --> 39:21.025
Growing up, I had a lot
of inner turmoil with my body.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.560
Coming into this new space,

39:22.560 --> 39:26.231
I'm finding some of my
old demons are surfacing.

39:26.231 --> 39:28.399
The most important thing is not
about how high your heels are.

39:28.399 --> 39:30.134
It's about
the performance you give.

39:30.134 --> 39:32.770
But I want to use Donna
to heal that,

39:32.770 --> 39:36.007
and so I'm trying
to, like, have fun with it.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.275
Why did you take off the shoes?

39:37.275 --> 39:39.043
This is gonna be a barrel.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.578
-Oh.
-And then I'm getting in,

39:40.578 --> 39:42.313
and so at that one point
I'm gonna be stomping grapes.

39:42.313 --> 39:43.314
Oh, werk.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.183
I always love
that this is only

39:45.183 --> 39:46.451
our second time seeing you,

39:46.451 --> 39:48.786
but you always have
a fully realized story.

39:48.786 --> 39:49.887
Yes, girl.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.522
I'm really excited
about this performance.

39:51.522 --> 39:54.058
I just need to hear
the audience's reaction,

39:54.058 --> 39:56.928
and then I need that to be
echoed in the judging panel.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.896
No negative reviews
is what I'm hoping for.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.332
Buongiorno, principessa.

40:01.332 --> 40:04.869
It's me, Donna Bellissima.

So good.

41:41.866 --> 41:42.867
You know what
that looked like?

41:42.867 --> 41:43.968
That looked like a queen

41:43.968 --> 41:45.002
that's been doing drag
for five years.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.003
Right?

41:48.139 --> 41:52.143
Now, that's a spicy drag queen.

41:56.881 --> 41:59.117
You know, listen,
what I loved about that

41:59.117 --> 42:01.152
was, first of all,
we found a very creative way

42:01.152 --> 42:02.587
for you to be out here barefoot.

42:02.587 --> 42:05.289
-Yeah.
-For starters.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.425
You dance really well,
you have a good time,

42:07.425 --> 42:08.960
your smile is beautiful.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.962
Also, the way you embodied it,

42:10.962 --> 42:13.264
the way you acted it,
you told us a story.

42:13.264 --> 42:16.100
Everything about that
was so much fun to watch,

42:16.100 --> 42:18.870
and that's what it was about.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.972
You are such a smart judge.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.040
[all laugh]

42:23.040 --> 42:26.177
You are part
of that performance.

42:26.177 --> 42:27.712
Your history,
who you are is there.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.380
That is so smart.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.816
Or as they say in Italy,
that's using your noodle.

42:31.816 --> 42:33.418
Okay?

[all laugh]

42:38.456 --> 42:41.926
It was just so thought-out
and so entertaining,

42:41.926 --> 42:45.463
and you look stun-ning.

42:45.463 --> 42:46.798
[cheers and applause]

42:46.798 --> 42:48.299
My favorite part
of the outfit

42:48.299 --> 42:50.902
is that you have the sort of
tube top thing on

42:50.902 --> 42:54.272
with the arms,
which is a very Italian look,

42:54.272 --> 42:56.240
and actually,
it works really well

42:56.240 --> 42:58.910
in proportionizing your body.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.478
What's your favorite part
of the outfit?

43:00.478 --> 43:01.712
Taking it off.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.217
One of the most amazing things
I've found out

43:06.217 --> 43:07.652
in this process of doing drag

43:07.652 --> 43:10.721
is that, like,
I feel invincible in this.

43:10.721 --> 43:12.657
Yeah.

43:12.657 --> 43:16.394
Ladies and gentlemen,
Donna Bellissima.

that was amazing.

That was the actor, though.
That's somebody who knows--

43:24.669 --> 43:25.970
Yeah, who knows how
to deal with the underlying...

Didn't see that coming.

44:04.041 --> 44:07.211
After last week's performance,
I am feeling fantastic.

44:07.211 --> 44:09.313
But I know if I'm
gonna take this all the way,

44:09.313 --> 44:11.482
I gotta keep
ramping that same lane

44:11.482 --> 44:12.517
up, up, and up.

-Jamal!
-What?

44:16.320 --> 44:17.455
What's the theme this week?

44:17.455 --> 44:19.023
This week, I'm gonna be
be a small town girl

44:19.023 --> 44:20.758
with a big burlesque talent.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.627
-Let's do it.
-All right.

44:22.627 --> 44:24.362
Knowing that
this week's about dance,

44:24.362 --> 44:25.630
I'm going to do just that.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.331
Dancing
is a big part of my life.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.033
I've been dancing
my whole life.

44:29.033 --> 44:33.371
Again, not in heels,
but I'm adapting. Slowly.

44:33.371 --> 44:35.840
I actually want to dedicate
this week to my daughters.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.376
They love the movie
that this is from.

44:38.376 --> 44:40.177
It's the title track
from the film,

44:40.177 --> 44:42.013
so I think they're gonna
be really proud

44:42.013 --> 44:44.315
of their dad/Poppy Love.

44:44.315 --> 44:45.750
Bitch.
[applause]

44:45.750 --> 44:47.084
Girl.

44:47.084 --> 44:49.720
The biggest trick is gonna be
be keeping the wig on.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.290
If I don't whip it,
I should be okay.

44:52.290 --> 44:54.425
If I just don't
wanna risk it too much.

44:54.425 --> 44:56.861
I think what I learned
about Poppy this last week

44:56.861 --> 44:58.829
is that she's a lot like me.

44:58.829 --> 45:00.164
The second she hits the stage,

45:00.164 --> 45:02.166
she is ready
to make a impression.

45:02.166 --> 45:05.436
And that's a lot of what
I like to do in my everyday job.

45:05.436 --> 45:08.673
I'm channeling that
natural high off of week one,

45:08.673 --> 45:10.741
wanting to maintain
the same level of performance,

45:10.741 --> 45:12.209
but even more.

45:12.209 --> 45:15.179
Poppy's gonna bring the heat.

with those things.

47:14.198 --> 47:15.866
Poppy, are you really
gonna come out here

47:15.866 --> 47:18.335
and do all that like that?

what could you do?

47:28.813 --> 47:30.247
But then you come out here

47:30.247 --> 47:32.283
and do something
that blows the roof off.

47:32.283 --> 47:33.317
Honestly...

47:33.317 --> 47:36.053
Thank you.

47:36.053 --> 47:37.621
The dancing, the lip sync.

47:37.621 --> 47:39.957
By the way, every single one
of Christina's runs

47:39.957 --> 47:41.358
you had to lip sync to.

47:41.358 --> 47:44.295
That is so hard to do
by itself,

47:44.295 --> 47:46.297
and then you added
the choreography

47:46.297 --> 47:48.733
and then you added
burlesque to it.

47:48.733 --> 47:51.869
Honestly, Poppy, unbelievable.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.237
Thank you so much.

47:53.237 --> 47:55.840
Thank you.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.909
Do you know how hard it is
to do what you just did, Poppy?

47:58.909 --> 48:02.046
Choreography, check.
Hardest of the night.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.380

48:11.422 --> 48:14.725
Yes, but this so far
has been the most fun,

48:14.725 --> 48:17.428
and I also wanted
to dedicate this song

48:17.428 --> 48:18.696
to my two
beautiful daughters,

48:18.696 --> 48:21.532
because this
is their favorite movie.

48:21.532 --> 48:24.935
-They love burlesque.
-Oh, yeah!

48:24.935 --> 48:27.404

It was so magnificent,

48:43.721 --> 48:46.557
every run, every moment.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.159
And in fact,
after you finished,

48:48.159 --> 48:50.961
all of the dancers,
they were smiling so hard

48:50.961 --> 48:53.564
because they couldn't
believe what you had just done.

48:53.564 --> 48:55.966
They're amazing.

48:58.769 --> 49:01.639
What did you have
difficulty with this week?

49:01.639 --> 49:05.976
You know, for me,
it was the very last move.

49:05.976 --> 49:09.113
I just didn't want
my wig to go flying off.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.681
That's really
the only thing,

49:10.681 --> 49:12.817
because I knew
I had to give it my all,

49:12.817 --> 49:15.019
and I'm, like,
well, you know what?

49:15.019 --> 49:16.187
If it comes off,
it comes off.

49:16.187 --> 49:17.822
What are you gonna do?
The show must go on.

49:17.822 --> 49:20.224
But that was the only thing
I was worried about really.

49:20.224 --> 49:21.392
Wow.

59:28.365 --> 59:30.100
Well, there
have been drag queens

59:30.100 --> 59:31.568
that have impersonated me

59:31.568 --> 59:34.571
far better than I could ever
probably impersonate myself.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.406
But you really transform.

59:36.406 --> 59:39.709
I really felt like
I became Electra Owl.

59:39.709 --> 59:41.344
♪ Won't you come on
and come on ♪

59:41.344 --> 59:43.547
♪ And raise your glass ♪

59:43.547 --> 59:46.983
♪ So let's dance
the last dance ♪

59:46.983 --> 59:49.219
♪ Tonight ♪

59:49.219 --> 59:51.788
As Electra,
I'm about eight feet high

59:51.788 --> 59:53.423
in unbearable heels, yes.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.325
I don't know how
these queens do it.

59:55.325 --> 59:56.793
Everything's ginormo.

59:56.793 --> 59:59.162
I felt I have a giant persona,

59:59.162 --> 1:00:01.498
but this is magnified.

1:00:01.498 --> 1:00:03.066
I'm loving this.
First time in drag.

1:00:03.066 --> 1:00:04.267
You're up on the main stage,

1:00:04.267 --> 1:00:07.103
and I feel like I'm 10 years old
with a bicycle.

1:00:07.103 --> 1:00:08.505
It's fun.

1:00:08.505 --> 1:00:11.141
For me, the most challenging
is I think the lip syncing.

1:00:11.141 --> 1:00:13.543
♪ Come on
and raise your glass ♪

1:00:13.543 --> 1:00:14.544
Great, great.

1:00:14.544 --> 1:00:15.645
It's just frustrating.

1:00:15.645 --> 1:00:17.547
You can't let it out.
You can't.

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:23.019
The newfound respect
I have for this entire process

1:00:23.019 --> 1:00:26.323
to becoming a drag queen
is enormous.

1:00:26.323 --> 1:00:28.291
-It's incredible.
-She's really...

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:29.459
It's hypnotizing almost.

1:00:29.459 --> 1:00:30.827
I feel like this is my drag--

1:00:30.827 --> 1:00:33.463
-This is a representation.
-This is Electra Owl.

1:00:33.463 --> 1:00:36.199
Being a drag queen
is just over the top fantastic,

1:00:36.199 --> 1:00:38.902
fabulous, owning yourself,
owning that floor,

1:00:38.902 --> 1:00:40.370
owning that moment.

1:00:40.370 --> 1:00:43.106
I really love the idea
of this metamorphosis

1:00:43.106 --> 1:00:44.808
from caterpillar to butterfly.

1:00:44.808 --> 1:00:46.476
You really transform,

1:00:46.476 --> 1:00:48.378
and who I became
is Electra Owl.

1:00:48.378 --> 1:00:51.715
[cheers and applause]

1:00:51.715 --> 1:00:55.285
Taylor Dayne, you know
I am your biggest fan.

1:00:55.285 --> 1:00:58.355
The only thing I don't have is
a tattoo of your name on my arm.

1:00:58.355 --> 1:00:59.556
We can fix that.

1:00:59.556 --> 1:01:02.092
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

1:01:02.092 --> 1:01:04.160
I'm so honored to be here.
Thank you all.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:07.464
Being up here today
and being in your shoes

1:01:07.464 --> 1:01:09.633
is a hella journey.

1:01:09.633 --> 1:01:13.403
[all laugh]

1:01:13.403 --> 1:01:15.605
Well, thanks to Electra Owl,

1:01:15.605 --> 1:01:17.941
your charity, Global Green,

1:01:17.941 --> 1:01:21.444
will receive
a donation of $5.000.

1:01:21.444 --> 1:01:23.380
[cheers and applause]

1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:26.816
May the power of drag
be with you always.

1:01:26.816 --> 1:01:31.488
Give it up for
Taylor Dayne/Electra Owl.

1:01:31.488 --> 1:01:34.591
[cheers and applause]

1:01:34.591 --> 1:01:38.628
Next week, seven queens return
to compete for the crown.

1:01:38.628 --> 1:01:41.598
Until then, remember
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:41.598 --> 1:01:43.366
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:43.366 --> 1:01:44.935
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:44.935 --> 1:01:46.937
-Amen!
-All right.

1:01:46.937 --> 1:01:48.772

RuPaul: Next time on RuPaul's
Secret Celebrity Drag Race...

1:02:05.221 --> 1:02:08.058
Category is Money, Honey.

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:10.660
The challenge is going
to be finding that sexiness.

1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:12.262
It's either embrace the sexy
or go home.

1:02:12.262 --> 1:02:13.964
The weeks are getting
more challenging as we go,

1:02:13.964 --> 1:02:15.131
and more competitive.

1:02:15.131 --> 1:02:17.300
How in the hell
do I make this person bigger?

1:02:17.300 --> 1:02:18.935
Bitch, you need
to sissy that walk.

1:02:18.935 --> 1:02:20.837
I'm about
to dehydrate the girls,

1:02:20.837 --> 1:02:22.706
because Thirsty
did not come to play.

1:02:22.706 --> 1:02:25.575
This is your last chance
to impress me

1:02:25.575 --> 1:02:28.445
and save yourself...

1:02:28.445 --> 1:02:31.445
[echoing] from elimination!
