01:30.036 --> 01:32.919
Any last-minute advice?

01:32.920 --> 01:34.039
Nope.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.740
Just tell the truth.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.599
Anything you admit here
can't be used against you,

01:38.624 --> 01:41.091
- so take advantage of that.
- Hmm.

01:43.710 --> 01:46.196
Was your first year anything like this?

01:47.290 --> 01:49.209
No.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.079
But my guess is my fourth year will be.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.249
Things are getting weirder.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.809
- They are, aren't they?
- It's the world.

01:56.107 --> 01:58.306
You're weathering it well.

01:59.143 --> 02:00.603
Thanks.

02:02.977 --> 02:04.809
You can go in now.

02:10.719 --> 02:12.615
Breathe and smile.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.122
Oh, come on!

02:20.147 --> 02:22.519
I brought my client in
for a voluntary interview,

02:22.544 --> 02:23.991
not a group interrogation!

02:24.016 --> 02:25.648
Hi! That's not for you.

02:25.673 --> 02:27.344
We're in here.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.256
Come on, they won't bite.

02:31.102 --> 02:32.641
Let 'em through, guys.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.609
Hi.

02:36.764 --> 02:38.844
Sorry, they're painting in the hallway,

02:38.869 --> 02:41.498
and, uh, the only way in is
through the sixth degree room.

02:41.523 --> 02:43.381
So, sorry about that. Well...

02:43.406 --> 02:45.079
Hi, I'm Lucca Quinn.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.726
- Hi.
- This is my client, Maia Rindell.

02:46.751 --> 02:49.695
Hi, yeah, I know, the NSA
sent over some of your e-mails.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.383
That's a joke.

02:51.408 --> 02:52.625
I'm punchy today.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.414
I'm Federal Agent Madeline Starkey.

02:54.439 --> 02:57.101
And, uh, why don't we
have a seat and chat?

03:00.084 --> 03:01.515
Oh...

03:13.553 --> 03:15.209
- There you go.
- Thank you.

03:18.002 --> 03:19.936
I'm out of breath.

03:19.961 --> 03:21.397
Oh...

03:22.080 --> 03:24.209
So, Maia, thank you so
much for coming today.

03:24.210 --> 03:26.889
Um, we really appreciate your
help with this investigation,

03:26.914 --> 03:29.110
I know this has not been easy on you.

03:29.135 --> 03:30.993
Uh, you understand Maia is here

03:31.018 --> 03:33.204
under the terms of the proffer
from the U.S. Attorney's Office?

03:33.229 --> 03:35.430
Absolutely, this is your
Queen for a Day session, yes.

03:35.455 --> 03:37.313
Nothing my client says
can be used against her.

03:37.338 --> 03:38.707
If she answers truthfully,

03:38.732 --> 03:40.616
that is correct and I know you will...

03:40.641 --> 03:43.641
because it's a felony to
lie to a, um, federal agent.

03:44.906 --> 03:46.669
18 USC 1001.

03:46.670 --> 03:48.067
Wow, that's exactly right.

03:48.092 --> 03:49.287
So, you understand that the proffer

03:49.312 --> 03:51.119
doesn't immunize you from perjury?

03:51.120 --> 03:52.286
- I do.
- Great.

03:52.311 --> 03:54.249
Good. So, here we are.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.474
Ooh, my gosh!

03:56.679 --> 03:58.008
You see what happened there?

03:58.050 --> 03:59.419
As the light hits the window,

03:59.420 --> 04:00.654
you know, in a particular way,

04:00.679 --> 04:02.444
the birds fly right into it.

04:03.631 --> 04:04.998
It's sad, really.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.013
Okay, um, I am going to take some notes,

04:10.038 --> 04:11.457
if that's all right with counsel?

04:11.482 --> 04:12.912
Go for it.

04:13.185 --> 04:15.685
Maia, let's talk about your parents.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.289
How did this Ponzi scheme begin?

04:18.290 --> 04:20.716
Uh, Maia doesn't know how
this Ponzi scheme began.

04:20.742 --> 04:23.006
Oh, right, right. My apologies.

04:23.031 --> 04:26.265
Um, let me be a little more discursive.

04:26.290 --> 04:28.224
Let's look at this as:

04:28.249 --> 04:31.725
Remembrance of Ponzi Schemes Past, huh?

04:31.750 --> 04:34.465
And, um, anything that
comes into your mind

04:34.490 --> 04:37.079
about your parents
or your uncle Jackson,

04:37.080 --> 04:38.458
you just spill it, okay?

04:38.483 --> 04:41.044
And I'll just sit here
and I'll write it down.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.105
Diane, I need you.

04:52.130 --> 04:54.055
We got a call from the courthouse.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.669
Another brutality case.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.903
Now?

04:56.928 --> 04:58.387
Guess who the cop is?

04:58.412 --> 04:59.786
I'm bad at this, Adrian.

04:59.811 --> 05:01.473
Andrew Theroux.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.255
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

05:04.830 --> 05:06.841
The case that brought us together, hmm?

05:06.866 --> 05:08.848
He stops a a motorist for expired tags,

05:08.873 --> 05:10.329
kicks him in the head.

05:10.330 --> 05:11.959
How do you know this?

05:11.960 --> 05:13.327
I have somebody down at County.

05:13.352 --> 05:17.319
I pay him $300 if he gives me
a heads-up on brutality cases.

05:17.344 --> 05:20.647
So we can get this dirty cop
off the force once and for all.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.790
- Good mornin'.
- Mornin'.

05:24.793 --> 05:26.151
What do we got?

05:26.176 --> 05:28.379
This is one of the worst
I've seen in a while.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.579
Anybody else seen him?

05:29.580 --> 05:32.339
Uh, the family members?
Lawyers? Anybody?

05:32.364 --> 05:34.789
No. Theroux brought
his load in last night.

05:34.790 --> 05:36.107
He's all yours.

05:36.132 --> 05:37.421
Good.

05:37.446 --> 05:39.249
Give us a half-hour with him.

05:39.489 --> 05:40.974
Are you my lawyers?

05:40.999 --> 05:43.066
We hope to be, Mr...

05:43.091 --> 05:45.341
Knutsen. Todd Knutsen.

05:45.366 --> 05:47.035
Look, I didn't do it.

05:47.060 --> 05:48.997
- The cop just searched my car.
- When was this?

05:49.022 --> 05:51.539
Last night, about midnight.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.832
It looks like they, uh, cleaned
up your injuries pretty good.

05:55.216 --> 05:56.858
Wh-where'd he kick you?

05:57.968 --> 06:00.685
Should I say he kicked me?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.039
What are you in for, son?

06:04.040 --> 06:05.622
Possession.

06:05.647 --> 06:07.452
Guard! Ugh!

06:07.477 --> 06:09.028
Where are the Handi Wipes?

06:10.403 --> 06:12.488
I need my Purell.

06:12.513 --> 06:14.380
This is abuse.

06:14.858 --> 06:16.703
Oh, dear God.

06:16.879 --> 06:18.942
Diane Lockhart. Ah...

06:18.967 --> 06:20.605
Thank God.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.709
Did Alicia call you?

06:21.710 --> 06:24.254
She said she couldn't take my case.

06:24.279 --> 06:26.340
No. So you're the brutality victim?

06:26.365 --> 06:27.676
Isn't it terrible?

06:27.701 --> 06:30.119
I... Look at this. Hmm? Hmm?

06:30.144 --> 06:31.770
Do you have any idea how hard it is

06:31.771 --> 06:33.948
to get blood out of Egyptian cotton?

06:33.973 --> 06:37.575
Oh... And now no Purell.

06:38.709 --> 06:40.636
I was driving down 290

06:40.661 --> 06:42.825
around 2:00 in the morning with Naftali.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.650
- Who's that?
- A-a friend.

06:44.675 --> 06:47.081
Adventurous. Israeli.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.645
Her father was a general.

06:48.670 --> 06:51.509
Don't get her started
on the Six-Day War.

06:51.848 --> 06:55.293
She loves seeing me in pain.

06:55.318 --> 06:57.278
The bruises on your face.

06:57.303 --> 06:59.090
How do we know those
aren't from Naftali?

06:59.115 --> 07:01.459
No. Naftali knows never...

07:01.460 --> 07:04.266
to hit me in the face, only
the back and the thighs.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.249
So you have bruises on
your back and your thighs?

07:07.274 --> 07:09.038
Mmm, slight bruises.

07:09.063 --> 07:11.119
Mostly scratches.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.977
What that woman can do

07:13.002 --> 07:15.641
with the end of a paper clip...

07:18.578 --> 07:21.287
I know. I'm not a good witness.

07:21.312 --> 07:24.023
Talk to her... Naftali Amado.

07:24.048 --> 07:26.179
She'll say exactly what I said.

07:26.204 --> 07:28.119
- Okay.
- Hey...

07:28.120 --> 07:29.669
they're out to get me.

07:30.001 --> 07:32.709
The same way they did with Rodney King.

07:32.977 --> 07:36.275
We've got a lot in common, he and I.

07:36.986 --> 07:40.579
Can't we all just get along?

07:42.425 --> 07:43.821
What do you think?

07:43.846 --> 07:45.892
Oh, he's the devil.

07:46.290 --> 07:49.060
And unfortunately, the
devil is our best chance

07:49.085 --> 07:52.368
to get Theroux kicked off the force.

07:55.439 --> 07:57.959
Um... I'm not sure how to start.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.669
Well, here, let-let's try this.

07:59.670 --> 08:02.532
From our forensic accounting,
the first criminal act...

08:02.557 --> 08:06.306
the first one where new funds
were used to pay off old debts...

08:06.331 --> 08:09.370
was September 15, 2008.

08:09.395 --> 08:10.837
Any thoughts?

08:11.056 --> 08:13.377
That was a long time ago. Um...

08:13.540 --> 08:15.345
2008?

08:15.806 --> 08:17.407
I would have been 17.

08:17.432 --> 08:19.032
And do you remember what
you were doing that day?

08:19.057 --> 08:20.579
I was probably in school.

08:20.580 --> 08:22.999
Okay. Well, it was the day
Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.377
Does that help?

08:25.330 --> 08:27.471
Breaking news. Stocks
all around the globe

08:27.496 --> 08:29.579
are in a free-fall at
this point, because...

08:29.580 --> 08:31.169
Holy God.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.674
The Dow expected to open down

08:33.698 --> 08:36.727
- over 300 points, as fears of...
- Uh, God... what?

08:39.547 --> 08:41.676
Anything you remember could help.

08:42.231 --> 08:45.838
If you're not sure of a memory,
just say you're not sure.

08:47.017 --> 08:48.361
Oh, God.

08:48.386 --> 08:50.338
What... uh, uh, what are we gonna say?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.158
- What am I gonna do?
- Stop. Stop it!

08:52.183 --> 08:53.236
We just have to get Jax.

08:53.261 --> 08:54.634
I-I've been all day making calls...

08:54.659 --> 08:57.103
Maia, do you recognize this name?

08:58.009 --> 08:59.564
Michael Hannigan.

08:59.589 --> 09:02.260
He was an investor
in your parent's fund.

09:04.221 --> 09:05.330
Yes.

09:05.355 --> 09:07.766
And he was at your
house on September 15?

09:07.791 --> 09:09.088
- Yes.
- Okay.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.885
- And your parents spoke with him?
- Yes.

09:14.392 --> 09:16.322
Jax was there, too.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.141
Um, my uncle Jax,

09:18.166 --> 09:20.416
he was there and-and spoke to him.

09:20.441 --> 09:22.670
To Hannigan? You're sure?

09:22.836 --> 09:25.002
This is temporary, Mike.

09:25.027 --> 09:27.073
You pull your money out
now, you're out eight mil...

09:27.572 --> 09:28.791
Yes.

09:28.816 --> 09:32.067
My mom, she, uh, uh, she called Jax

09:32.092 --> 09:33.838
and he came over...

09:33.863 --> 09:35.674
to tell Mike Hannigan that...

09:35.699 --> 09:37.521
if he pulled his money from the fund,

09:37.547 --> 09:41.250
then he would be out
something like $8 million,

09:41.275 --> 09:44.079
and the best course was
to keep his money in.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.588
And what time did Jax come by?

09:48.172 --> 09:49.711
I was still doing my homework.

09:49.736 --> 09:51.619
Uh, so...

09:51.798 --> 09:54.885
probably about 4:00 in the afternoon.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.829
Okay. And how long was he there?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.180
I think two hours.

09:59.205 --> 10:02.209
Because he was... he
was gone before dinner.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.283
And you had dinner with your parents?

10:04.924 --> 10:08.265
You can't always be promising 12%.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.055
Well, it's not about what we prom...

10:10.728 --> 10:11.892
Yes.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.805
Good. Now, here's the problem, Maia.

10:14.830 --> 10:18.119
I have your mother's
computer calendar, and, uh...

10:18.120 --> 10:21.221
If you'll pardon me, I'm
still a bit of a Luddite.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.899
I need it printed out, and, uh...

10:23.924 --> 10:26.267
"Luddite," God, I hate
that word, don't you?

10:26.744 --> 10:28.330
I don't think I have an opinion.

10:28.355 --> 10:29.784
It's like "meme."

10:29.809 --> 10:31.145
It's one of those words

10:31.170 --> 10:33.709
that makes the English language so ugly.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.996
- The calendar.
- Yes.

10:35.021 --> 10:38.236
So on this day, your mother says

10:38.261 --> 10:41.272
you had a gynecologist
appointment at 3:00 p.m.,

10:41.297 --> 10:43.392
uh, with a Dr. Regina.

10:44.196 --> 10:45.629
So here's the problem,

10:45.654 --> 10:47.249
I'm not sure how you could have seen

10:47.250 --> 10:49.329
your uncle Jax at
your house at 4:00 p.m.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.562
when you were at a doctor's
appointment at 3:00 p.m.

10:51.617 --> 10:53.374
Excuse me, you're asking about something

10:53.399 --> 10:54.742
that happened nine years ago.

10:54.767 --> 10:57.295
Oh, I know. Look, I'm
on your side in this.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.959
I know that memory can be faulty.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.265
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.440
Maia.

11:08.730 --> 11:10.539
Were you there at the
doctor's appointment?

11:10.540 --> 11:11.683
I was.

11:11.708 --> 11:13.972
Uh, maybe I-I saw Jax

11:13.997 --> 11:15.589
and Mr. Hannigan later.

11:15.614 --> 11:16.705
Or another day, maybe?

11:16.730 --> 11:18.269
No. No, I don't think so.

11:18.294 --> 11:19.745
It... it was on that day.

11:19.770 --> 11:21.063
Well, here's the problem.

11:21.088 --> 11:23.097
The distance between Dr. Regina's office

11:23.122 --> 11:25.346
and your house is 12.4 miles,

11:25.371 --> 11:27.713
and it was very, very
heavy traffic that day.

11:27.738 --> 11:30.769
- How do we know that?
- My minions, my FBI minions.

11:30.794 --> 11:32.619
They know everything.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.699
And they give me hard copies.

11:34.724 --> 11:36.363
So by the time you would
get home with your mother

11:36.388 --> 11:37.869
it would have been 5:30.

11:37.894 --> 11:39.541
And your housekeeper

11:39.566 --> 11:41.641
said she served you
dinner right at 5:30.

11:41.666 --> 11:43.719
- What did Jax say?
- Jax...

11:43.744 --> 11:45.009
says he was never at your house at all.

11:45.034 --> 11:46.884
That is not true. He was there.

11:46.909 --> 11:48.033
But you can't remember when.

11:48.058 --> 11:50.169
No. No, but I...

11:50.170 --> 11:53.072
I remember that he was there.

11:56.579 --> 11:59.818
You know, when I was, uh, about eight,

11:59.843 --> 12:01.686
I was on Bozo's Circus.

12:01.830 --> 12:03.715
And, uh... you're too
young to remember this...

12:03.740 --> 12:04.919
but it was a really big deal.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.169
I was sitting in the
audience with my mom,

12:07.170 --> 12:09.037
and I was chosen for
the grand prize game,

12:09.062 --> 12:11.108
which is another very big deal.

12:11.133 --> 12:14.748
And I remember as I got that
ball into bucket number six,

12:14.773 --> 12:17.311
and the confetti was all over the place,

12:17.336 --> 12:19.569
the crowd was roaring.

12:19.594 --> 12:22.676
And last year my mother
showed me some pictures,

12:22.701 --> 12:24.272
from that day.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.614
I wasn't on the Bozo show.

12:26.639 --> 12:28.388
My older sister was.

12:28.413 --> 12:30.579
See, the mind has an odd way of turning

12:30.580 --> 12:33.449
wishful thinking into actual memories.

12:33.474 --> 12:34.919
Okay...

12:34.920 --> 12:36.709
I think we should take a pause there.

12:36.710 --> 12:38.036
I want to confer with my client.

12:38.037 --> 12:39.269
Oh, absolutely. Please.

12:39.294 --> 12:41.289
And remember, this is Queen for a Day,

12:41.290 --> 12:43.651
so no gotcha questions here.

12:45.292 --> 12:47.079
Go around, go around!

12:47.104 --> 12:48.636
Painters. Sorry.

12:48.661 --> 12:49.905
Uh, just go out that door.

12:49.930 --> 12:51.401
Door you came.

12:54.290 --> 12:55.379
Uh, sorry.

12:55.380 --> 12:56.855
We're just, uh...

12:57.080 --> 12:59.284
There's just painters, so...

13:03.823 --> 13:05.753
Okay, here's my advice.

13:05.778 --> 13:09.111
She is not your friend. She's
trying to catch you in lies.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.487
- I'm not lying.
- I understand.

13:11.512 --> 13:13.409
I know you're trying
to protect your parents,

13:13.434 --> 13:15.329
but she can see you're doing that.

13:15.330 --> 13:17.329
So don't talk about
Jax being with Hannigan

13:17.330 --> 13:20.050
unless you have a specific memory.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.879
I don't want to hurt my dad.

13:24.911 --> 13:26.286
I know.

13:26.311 --> 13:29.090
But your proffer only
covers you if you don't lie.

13:29.115 --> 13:31.976
If you lie to protect your
dad, you might get him off,

13:32.001 --> 13:33.926
but you'll end up in jail.

13:36.808 --> 13:38.382
All rise.

13:38.407 --> 13:40.988
The Honorable Don Linden presiding.

13:44.844 --> 13:47.024
Uh, n-uh, no, Steve, I have it.

13:52.058 --> 13:53.431
No.

14:02.047 --> 14:03.172
Okay.

14:06.087 --> 14:07.716
Oh!

14:07.741 --> 14:10.025
Well, I guess I won that bet.

14:10.050 --> 14:14.555
Mr. Sweeney, how nice
of you to join us again.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.539
I am innocent man, Your Honor.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.052
Your Honor, our client

14:18.077 --> 14:20.997
has very deep roots in his community...

14:21.022 --> 14:23.255
And a private jet on standby at O'Hare.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.880
Okay, what is the charge?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.115
- Resisting arrest.
- Aggravated battery.

14:26.140 --> 14:28.209
No. Aggravated battery.

14:28.210 --> 14:29.333
Wait, what?

14:29.358 --> 14:31.074
Your Honor, this is a misdemeanor.

14:31.099 --> 14:32.138
No, a felony.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.716
Now, Mr. Sweeney struck
out at the officer,

14:33.741 --> 14:35.169
striking him in the head and face.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.815
This is gross overcharging.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.095
- All lives matter.
- Don't get cute, sir.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.494
Shut up, Colin. I'm
finally on your side.

14:41.519 --> 14:43.579
Your Honor, we ask that Mr. Sweeney

14:43.580 --> 14:45.619
be released on his own recognizance.

14:45.644 --> 14:48.169
He's a victim of
overzealous prosecution.

14:48.170 --> 14:51.170
He all but has a target
on his back, Your Honor.

14:51.171 --> 14:53.180
Oh, gee, I wonder why.

14:53.205 --> 14:56.268
Bail is set at three million dollars.

14:56.293 --> 14:57.621
Next.

14:57.623 --> 15:00.330
- Attica. Attica.
- Shh.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.805
You're smiling. Why?

15:03.830 --> 15:05.862
Felony aggravated battery

15:05.887 --> 15:07.768
against a police officer.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.619
We can put Theroux on the stand?

15:11.620 --> 15:13.034
Yup.

15:13.059 --> 15:15.690
If they kept it a
misdemeanor, we couldn't.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.895
So Colin Sweeney is gonna
do his one good deed:

15:18.920 --> 15:21.432
get a dirty cop kicked off the force.

15:21.457 --> 15:22.720
Boo-yah!

15:28.908 --> 15:31.837
Yup, you missed an entire flock.

15:31.862 --> 15:33.392
Did you two get everything settled?

15:33.417 --> 15:34.783
There was nothing to settle.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.805
But we talked. And we're back.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.289
Good. Good, good, good.

15:38.290 --> 15:39.892
So, Maia, I want you to take a look

15:39.917 --> 15:42.250
at your mother's calendar, okay?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.548
I think you'll see that

15:43.573 --> 15:45.123
you two have a few appointments listed

15:45.148 --> 15:47.143
over the years, and not just the gyno.

15:47.168 --> 15:48.361
See?

15:50.875 --> 15:52.541
For example, on October 3,

15:52.566 --> 15:54.736
you had another
appointment with Dr. Regina.

15:54.761 --> 15:57.533
And, uh, then, on October 23,

15:57.558 --> 15:59.709
you went with your mother
to her dental checkup.

15:59.710 --> 16:00.908
And then on November 4,

16:00.933 --> 16:02.814
the two of you went to see a movie.

16:03.017 --> 16:05.141
- Do you remember what you saw?
- No.

16:05.166 --> 16:06.939
Yeah, well, why don't you
take a good look at that

16:06.964 --> 16:08.789
and, uh, put a check mark

16:08.790 --> 16:11.580
next to the ones that you remember.

16:14.533 --> 16:17.371
Well, the worry is not STD...

16:18.541 --> 16:21.415
Maia has a boyfr...

16:22.532 --> 16:24.170
What can I do to help, Doct...

16:27.146 --> 16:28.691
Thank you.

16:29.357 --> 16:31.395
So you and your mom were
together at these times?

16:31.420 --> 16:32.886
Yes.

16:33.566 --> 16:36.347
As far as I remember, yes.

16:36.393 --> 16:37.605
Okay.

16:38.075 --> 16:39.557
Well, here's the problem...

16:39.582 --> 16:41.144
It would be easier if you would just

16:41.169 --> 16:42.933
tell us a problem before
there is a problem.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.621
Your mother wasn't with
you at these appointments.

16:46.378 --> 16:47.707
- What do you mean?
- That's when she was off

16:47.732 --> 16:49.941
sleeping with your uncle Jax.

16:52.665 --> 16:55.824
She used as an excuse these
appointments in her calendar

16:55.849 --> 16:58.455
so she could meet with
your uncle Jax at his home.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.730
Maia had no way to know that.

16:59.755 --> 17:02.410
Yes, but just because her
mother has it in her calendar

17:02.435 --> 17:03.539
doesn't mean it's true.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.386
And Maia shouldn't confirm it

17:05.411 --> 17:07.058
if it's not true.

17:09.683 --> 17:11.121
Some of those dates are true.

17:11.146 --> 17:13.316
None of these dates are true, Maia.

17:13.710 --> 17:14.855
Every two weeks,

17:14.880 --> 17:16.829
your mother met with your uncle Jax,

17:16.829 --> 17:18.358
at his home...

17:18.384 --> 17:20.105
since 2008.

17:26.609 --> 17:28.280
Is it possible...

17:28.305 --> 17:31.077
that your mother is
working with your uncle Jax

17:31.102 --> 17:32.196
to set up your dad?

17:32.221 --> 17:33.407
My client cannot answer that.

17:33.432 --> 17:35.742
'Cause here's the problem, Maia.

17:36.219 --> 17:37.499
You were used as a cover

17:37.500 --> 17:40.225
so your mother could sleep with
your uncle for several years.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.532
And you didn't suspect anything?

17:46.141 --> 17:48.225
- No.
- Okay.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.879
And in that same time frame,

17:49.880 --> 17:51.516
did you ever suspect your parents

17:51.541 --> 17:52.657
of their Ponzi scheme?

17:52.682 --> 17:54.720
I think we should take a
break for lunch at this point.

17:54.745 --> 17:57.047
- I'd like to go for a few more hours.
- No.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.016
Let's take a break.

17:59.041 --> 18:01.392
Sure. If you insist.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.405
Nat, you need to get some sleep.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.250
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

18:22.275 --> 18:25.814
We have another client who
was brutalized by a cop.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.734
You do know I work
for COPA, not for you?

18:28.759 --> 18:30.539
Civilian Office...

18:30.564 --> 18:32.210
of Police Accountability.

18:32.235 --> 18:35.046
Just in case you haven't
noticed, we are civilians.

18:35.071 --> 18:36.929
You're not civilians, you're parasites.

18:36.954 --> 18:39.812
It was during a routine
traffic stop, Nat.

18:39.837 --> 18:41.419
You'll want to write this down.

18:41.522 --> 18:43.272
Guess who the cop is?

18:43.859 --> 18:45.664
Andrew Theroux.

18:46.540 --> 18:47.953
And when-when was this?

18:47.978 --> 18:49.375
Last night.

18:49.750 --> 18:52.070
- You're bringing a suit?
- Yup. Another six million.

18:52.095 --> 18:53.500
Who's the victim?

18:54.500 --> 18:55.820
All right, every citizen deserves

18:55.845 --> 18:57.156
equal protection under the law.

18:57.181 --> 18:58.437
- Who's the victim?
- Give him a chance.

18:58.462 --> 19:00.656
- He hasn't done anything wrong.
- Adrian.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.600
Colin Sweeney.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.498
All right. Okay, okay.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.515
The cops have been
following this guy around,

19:10.540 --> 19:12.085
looking for some kind of payback.

19:14.617 --> 19:16.171
He dragged him out of the car

19:16.196 --> 19:18.195
and kicked him in the head.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.750
COPA has to investigate.

19:19.775 --> 19:21.265
Now, you know it's not about Sweeney,

19:21.290 --> 19:23.766
it's about getting this
piece of shit off the force.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.287
Come on. Come to court.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.617
We're gonna put Theroux on the stand.

19:27.642 --> 19:30.523
All I want is an open mind. Come on.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.937
- That was Internal Affairs?
- That was COPA.

19:36.475 --> 19:37.695
And they're not gonna investigate.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.219
Destroy Theroux on the stand.

19:41.288 --> 19:42.781
He'll be back.

19:43.210 --> 19:46.484
At first he was agitated,
then he got belligerent.

19:46.509 --> 19:47.945
It seemed to me that he was on drugs.

19:47.970 --> 19:50.100
I haven't used drugs in 20 years.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.188
- Shh.
- Whisper quieter, Mr. Sweeney.

19:52.213 --> 19:54.914
- I can hear you up here.
- Sorry, Your Honor.

19:54.939 --> 19:56.560
I think my eardrum is damaged

19:56.585 --> 19:58.101
from when the officer hit me last night.

19:58.126 --> 19:59.662
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

19:59.687 --> 20:01.619
Shut up, Mr. Sweeney.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.857
And how did you react
to his struggle, Officer?

20:04.882 --> 20:07.379
I tried to use only as
much force as was necessary

20:07.380 --> 20:08.664
to gain his compliance.

20:08.689 --> 20:11.003
Unfortunately, he chose to attack me,

20:11.028 --> 20:12.667
and, I'm sorry to say,

20:12.692 --> 20:13.817
did some damage.

20:13.842 --> 20:15.595
These bruises here and here?

20:15.620 --> 20:17.113
- If I did that,
- Yes, sir.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.900
- don't you think I'd have some marks...
- Also cuts inside my mouth.

20:18.925 --> 20:20.542
- ... on my hands?
- My doctor believes I'll need to have

20:20.567 --> 20:23.425
some corrective surgery
in order to reset my teeth.

20:23.450 --> 20:25.425
Jay. It's Diane.

20:25.450 --> 20:28.305
I just forwarded you a
picture of Theroux's injuries.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.829
I never thought I'd say this,
but I think there's a chance

20:30.830 --> 20:33.574
Colin Sweeney is telling the truth.

20:37.242 --> 20:38.812
_

20:40.993 --> 20:42.162
Maia.

20:42.187 --> 20:43.843
We're back in.

20:47.048 --> 20:49.420
Hi. Well, I hope you
both had a nice lunch.

20:49.423 --> 20:51.070
I'd like to keep this under three hours.

20:51.095 --> 20:52.374
Mm-hmm. Certainly.

20:52.399 --> 20:53.710
- See's?
- No, thank you.

20:53.713 --> 20:55.069
- See's?
- No.

20:55.366 --> 20:56.919
My husband picked out all the good stuff

20:56.920 --> 20:58.358
and sent me to work with the coconuts.

20:59.438 --> 21:02.499
- What's your husband's name?
- Uh, Michael... son.

21:02.766 --> 21:05.061
- Why?
- How long have you two been married?

21:09.970 --> 21:13.145
I googled you... over lunch.

21:13.170 --> 21:14.789
You're not married.

21:15.155 --> 21:17.718
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.538
You got me.

21:21.085 --> 21:23.116
You were also instrumental
in the convictions

21:23.141 --> 21:25.811
of Blagojevich and George Ryan.

21:25.836 --> 21:28.429
Did the folksy thing work on them, too?

21:36.079 --> 21:38.755
Well, there was one lawyer,
uh, in one of the cases...

21:38.780 --> 21:40.499
and I'm not gonna say who...

21:40.500 --> 21:42.271
we weren't interested in his client.

21:42.296 --> 21:45.289
We only asked him to come in
for a how-do-you-do meeting.

21:45.290 --> 21:48.115
Uh, but this lawyer was so aggressive

21:48.140 --> 21:49.943
and so suspicious...

21:49.968 --> 21:52.789
that we decided to probe
further into his client.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.169
And that client...

21:54.170 --> 21:55.749
is now in prison.

21:56.263 --> 21:58.240
- Sweet story.
- Well, it's a true one.

21:58.265 --> 22:00.395
Are you advising me not
to represent my client?

22:00.396 --> 22:01.449
Oh, far from it.

22:01.474 --> 22:03.193
I think it would benefit both of us

22:03.218 --> 22:06.076
if Maia were to offer all she knows.

22:06.271 --> 22:08.013
Undiluted.

22:09.404 --> 22:11.021
What do you need, Ms. Starkey?

22:11.046 --> 22:13.459
Well, I'd like to
turn to the foundation.

22:13.484 --> 22:15.474
The... the Rindell Foundation.

22:18.974 --> 22:20.873
You're one of three board members?

22:20.898 --> 22:22.487
Uh, yes.

22:22.512 --> 22:24.006
And you...

22:24.935 --> 22:27.396
When was the last time the board met?

22:27.421 --> 22:29.130
Uh, I don't know.

22:29.155 --> 22:30.404
Um, a few years ago?

22:30.429 --> 22:32.388
If you have the answer
you can just tell her.

22:32.413 --> 22:33.983
Well, uh...

22:34.008 --> 22:37.092
well, uh... I think
the last board meeting

22:37.117 --> 22:40.249
and only board meeting
was June 18, 2011.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.443
Do you know of any other
dates? Any more meetings?

22:42.468 --> 22:44.295
- No.
- Okay. That doesn't bother you?

22:44.320 --> 22:45.435
Tell me what you mean.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.169
Well, it's a foundation with...

22:47.170 --> 22:49.999
$65 million in assets...

22:50.000 --> 22:52.240
and you only met once?

22:54.233 --> 22:57.055
Well, the foundation wasn't my idea.

22:57.056 --> 22:58.395
Uh, it was...

22:58.420 --> 22:59.843
It was your parents, yeah.

22:59.868 --> 23:03.459
Yes, but it was for a good cause.

23:03.460 --> 23:05.241
For malaria prevention in Africa.

23:05.266 --> 23:07.772
Oh, and how much did
you spend on prevention?

23:10.139 --> 23:11.468
Yeah, but...

23:11.493 --> 23:13.619
I just want to know
how much we're sending.

23:13.620 --> 23:14.663
Honey.

23:14.688 --> 23:16.257
You know, it's a lot, uh, honey.

23:16.282 --> 23:18.418
I mean, we're not skimping.

23:21.257 --> 23:23.149
- I don't know.
- Oh, well, that's okay, Maia.

23:23.174 --> 23:25.421
You were a figurehead.
That's not a bad thing.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.022
You're not in trouble.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.676
Yeah, but Dad, I mean,
it's got my name on it.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.085
I have to know.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.819
Oh...

23:33.202 --> 23:35.935
Okay, I'll-I'll have Jax
open the books to you.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.249
Just give us a few weeks.

23:37.274 --> 23:38.921
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:38.946 --> 23:40.718
Do you need a moment?

23:42.296 --> 23:43.452
No.

23:43.477 --> 23:45.577
Uh, so let's talk about

23:45.602 --> 23:48.813
the day the foundation was formed.

23:49.138 --> 23:50.638
- Did you get it?
- Right here.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.272
- Affidavits?
- Here.

23:52.676 --> 23:55.132
You just saved his ass. Thank you, Jay.

23:55.157 --> 23:56.475
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

23:56.500 --> 23:58.080
Good to know.

24:01.619 --> 24:04.416
- Hello, Officer Theroux.
- Hello.

24:04.441 --> 24:06.385
This is a familiar spot for you...

24:06.410 --> 24:08.182
being questioned about police brutality.

24:08.207 --> 24:10.252
Objection. Argumentative. And rude.

24:10.277 --> 24:11.866
Sustained to the first.

24:11.891 --> 24:13.387
Overruled to the second.

24:14.729 --> 24:16.342
Officer, um,

24:16.367 --> 24:18.475
do you work out at Savoy's Gym?

24:18.500 --> 24:20.432
Uh... yes, why?

24:20.460 --> 24:22.560
Do you recall yesterday
afternoon sparring

24:22.585 --> 24:25.690
with a 19-year-old welterweight

24:25.715 --> 24:27.619
named Hector Peraza,

24:27.620 --> 24:30.060
who, according to
eyewitnesses, knocked you out?

24:30.085 --> 24:32.229
That's bullshit... he
didn't knock me out.

24:32.254 --> 24:34.523
My apologies. But you sparred with him?

24:34.548 --> 24:35.843
Yeah, I held my own.

24:35.868 --> 24:37.773
And this was before you went on duty?

24:37.798 --> 24:39.279
Yes. Why?

24:39.304 --> 24:42.248
Well, isn't it possible
that these bruises here

24:42.273 --> 24:45.234
are the result of punches
thrown by Hector Peraza?

24:45.259 --> 24:47.453
- No.
- Well, these are photos...

24:47.478 --> 24:49.641
of cuts and lacerations...

24:49.666 --> 24:51.719
inside your mouth, Officer Theroux.

24:51.744 --> 24:52.977
Objection. Not in evidence.

24:53.001 --> 24:55.740
These are police photos, Your Honor.

24:55.765 --> 24:57.499
- We didn't take them.
- Unless you want to throw out

24:57.524 --> 24:59.725
all your photos, Mr. ASA,

24:59.750 --> 25:00.786
overruled.

25:00.811 --> 25:04.379
Do you see these
lacerations, Officer Theroux?

25:04.547 --> 25:06.219
Those lacerations

25:06.244 --> 25:08.726
are in the same shape as this.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.648
The mouth guard at Savoy's Gym.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.255
You guys are good.

25:27.178 --> 25:31.395
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

25:31.420 --> 25:34.039
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

25:34.040 --> 25:36.373
So this was your 18th birthday?

25:36.398 --> 25:38.387
Yes.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.903
And that's when your parents gifted you

25:39.928 --> 25:41.419
the Rindell Foundation?

25:41.537 --> 25:43.178
Uh, yes.

25:43.203 --> 25:46.733
My parents, they-they knew
I was interested in Africa.

25:46.758 --> 25:50.194
I had read that malaria
kills one million kids a year

25:50.219 --> 25:53.118
and that it could be prevented...

25:53.143 --> 25:54.879
with mosquito netting.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.993
So they wanted me to run an effort

25:57.018 --> 25:59.493
to pay for the netting for...

25:59.518 --> 26:01.556
60% of African children.

26:01.581 --> 26:03.379
Wow. Well, that is a good cause,

26:03.380 --> 26:05.977
and thank you so much for doing that.

26:06.002 --> 26:08.118
Can I ask you who
else was at your party?

26:08.164 --> 26:10.579
Uh... a lot of people.

26:10.580 --> 26:13.493
How 'bout your girlfriend,
uh, Amy Breslin?

26:15.852 --> 26:18.271
Yes, she was there.

26:18.296 --> 26:21.031
But she wasn't my
girlfriend at the time.

26:21.056 --> 26:22.919
Uncle Jax introduced us.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.351
She was just entering law school.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.828
And your boyfriend was there, too?

26:32.471 --> 26:34.498
I have to get back.

26:34.571 --> 26:36.570
Maia, was he there?

26:37.330 --> 26:38.568
- Yes.
- Okay.

26:38.593 --> 26:40.855
Well, that's not complicated.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.154
Okay.

26:42.179 --> 26:44.543
And Diane Lockhart, was she there?

26:49.611 --> 26:52.253
Yes, she was there, too.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.277
You sure you don't want
one? They're delicious.

26:55.302 --> 26:56.879
From your husband?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.425
Okay.

26:58.426 --> 27:00.324
Now, did you hear Ms. Lockhart offer

27:00.349 --> 27:02.253
any legal advice to your parents?

27:02.278 --> 27:03.941
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.

27:03.966 --> 27:05.527
This is not material
covered by the proffer.

27:05.552 --> 27:07.706
Well, anything that has
to do with the Ponzi scheme

27:07.731 --> 27:08.761
is covered by the proffer.

27:08.786 --> 27:10.917
Hearsay conversations which, in fact,

27:10.942 --> 27:13.199
may be subject to attorney-client
privilege are not...

27:13.224 --> 27:16.042
Actually, my current case is a homicide.

27:16.067 --> 27:19.206
My client is accused of
killing a mutual fund manager

27:19.231 --> 27:20.855
who worked with Bernie Madoff.

27:20.911 --> 27:22.605
Ooh, really?

27:22.880 --> 27:23.992
Do you know him?

27:24.017 --> 27:25.766
- Bernie? No.
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.791 --> 27:27.156
Do we, Lenore?

27:27.181 --> 27:28.585
Maybe Jax... I don't know.

27:28.610 --> 27:30.757
All I'm asking is if she has a memory.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.882
- If she doesn't, we can move on...
- That's not what I'm saying...

27:34.470 --> 27:36.379
I have to get back.

27:40.168 --> 27:41.353
Call me.

27:41.378 --> 27:42.437
Wait, wait, wait.

27:42.462 --> 27:43.804
This is a fishing
expedition on your part.

27:43.829 --> 27:44.834
All I'm saying is if she has a memory,

27:44.860 --> 27:46.085
I will hear it, or we'll...

27:46.110 --> 27:47.297
- You are digging.
- No, no, no, no.

27:47.322 --> 27:49.375
Lenore, do you think
that Ruth Madoff knew

27:49.400 --> 27:51.296
what her husband was doing?

27:51.992 --> 27:53.499
Ooh.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.906
No. Why?

27:55.931 --> 27:57.025
See, I think she didn't know

27:57.050 --> 27:59.040
- because she didn't want to know.
- Yeah.

28:00.954 --> 28:02.323
How could she not know?

28:02.348 --> 28:03.678
- ... I will hear it, or we'll...
- You are digging.

28:03.703 --> 28:06.664
No, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Just a sec.

28:07.335 --> 28:08.679
Here's the problem, Ms. Quinn...

28:08.704 --> 28:10.546
We have a lot of
problems here, don't we?

28:10.571 --> 28:13.101
These foundation documents
were signed by Maia.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.959
And she signed them, she just admitted,

28:14.960 --> 28:16.531
on the night of her birthday party,

28:16.556 --> 28:18.329
her 18th birthday.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.329
So she is responsible...

28:20.330 --> 28:22.271
for any crimes committed
by this foundation.

28:22.296 --> 28:25.390
Our proffer is about Maia's
involvement with this fund,

28:25.445 --> 28:26.945
not Diane Lockhart's advice...

28:26.970 --> 28:28.351
I hate to be the bad guy here,

28:28.376 --> 28:31.820
but millions of dollars were
being parked into that foundation

28:31.845 --> 28:34.210
to hide them from an SEC audit.

28:34.235 --> 28:36.646
That is a felony crime.

28:36.671 --> 28:40.601
Now, unless Maia tells us
about Diane Lockhart's advice

28:40.626 --> 28:42.102
to her parents,

28:42.127 --> 28:44.858
we will stop this questioning now

28:44.883 --> 28:46.507
and prosecute.

28:48.359 --> 28:52.180
I need to be 18 for those
documents to be official?

28:52.205 --> 28:53.964
Yes. And you were.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.468
You signed them on your 18th birthday.

28:56.718 --> 28:59.156
We had my birthday party on a Saturday,

28:59.181 --> 29:03.593
and I didn't turn 18 until
the following Tuesday.

29:12.802 --> 29:14.591
Come on.

29:16.954 --> 29:18.380
You know,

29:18.405 --> 29:21.154
maybe I will have one of those candies.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.224
Nice try, Agent.

29:24.693 --> 29:28.568
Is this the kind of finesse
you used on Blagojevich?

29:38.764 --> 29:40.137
Nice, Maia.

29:40.170 --> 29:41.248
Lucky.

29:41.273 --> 29:42.851
No, I've seen lucky.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.677
That was smart.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.989
I have another witness, Your Honor.

29:56.014 --> 29:57.849
Naftali Amado.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.329
I thought you said she was on your side.

30:01.330 --> 30:02.832
She is.

30:02.857 --> 30:04.185
She was.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.216
Naftali.

30:07.591 --> 30:09.209
Hello, Ms. Amado.

30:09.210 --> 30:10.999
Hello, man.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.300
You were with Mr. Sweeney
when his car was pulled over,

30:14.325 --> 30:15.863
- isn't that correct?
- Ken.

30:15.888 --> 30:17.302
We speak English here.

30:17.327 --> 30:18.864
Ah. Yes.

30:18.889 --> 30:20.232
Hebrew makes me so hot.

30:20.257 --> 30:21.950
And what happened after
you were pulled over?

30:21.975 --> 30:24.964
The policeman, he comes over to us.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.224
He says, uh, we need to show the...

30:28.249 --> 30:30.145
um, um,

30:30.170 --> 30:31.286
the, um,

30:31.311 --> 30:32.755
- uh, lice?
- License?

30:32.780 --> 30:35.569
Yes. But, uh, Mr. Sweeney...

30:35.610 --> 30:38.668
is very, very hot.

30:40.497 --> 30:42.325
He gets out of the car,

30:42.350 --> 30:44.310
punches the policeman.

30:45.368 --> 30:47.367
That is outrageous.

30:47.392 --> 30:49.185
You are outrageous.

30:49.210 --> 30:50.673
- You...
- You sit back down.

30:50.698 --> 30:52.001
Excuse me, ma'am.

30:52.026 --> 30:53.415
That is my job.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.079
Please, Mr. Sweeney.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.580
- Any more questions, Counselor?
- Nothing further.

31:06.563 --> 31:07.981
Ah, painting's done.

31:08.006 --> 31:09.742
You can come in this way now.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.419
Here you go.

31:13.420 --> 31:14.938
Have a seat.

31:17.396 --> 31:20.265
I'd like to apologize for
the uncomfortable mess...

31:21.627 --> 31:22.764
earlier this afternoon.

31:22.789 --> 31:24.422
It was all on me. My bad.

31:24.447 --> 31:25.513
I'm sorry.

31:25.538 --> 31:27.874
I don't want things
to be tense between us.

31:27.899 --> 31:29.133
- We don't either.
- Good.

31:29.158 --> 31:30.961
So we're friends again?

31:31.164 --> 31:33.297
- Sure.
- Okay. Good.

31:33.670 --> 31:36.669
Maia, um, let's talk about
when you did become aware

31:36.670 --> 31:38.071
of the Ponzi scheme.

31:38.096 --> 31:41.301
You said it was when
the press reported on it.

31:41.326 --> 31:43.156
Yes.

31:43.516 --> 31:46.203
- And not before?
- Uh, uh, that is correct.

31:46.228 --> 31:48.669
You graduated from law
school in 2016, right?

31:48.670 --> 31:50.710
- Yes.
- Was it a big day?

31:51.360 --> 31:52.905
I don't understand.

31:52.930 --> 31:55.619
Well, there was a celebration
at your parents' house.

31:55.644 --> 31:57.093
To a fantastic year.

31:57.118 --> 31:58.141
Whoa!

32:00.329 --> 32:01.749
Yes, there was.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.321
Your parents were there?

32:03.346 --> 32:04.899
Amy's parents were there?

32:06.071 --> 32:08.563
- Thank you for being here.
- Oh, Maia...

32:09.751 --> 32:11.145
Yes, Sam and Connie.

32:11.170 --> 32:13.305
Okay. Sam and Connie.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.165
Now, were you living with Amy, uh,

32:15.190 --> 32:17.079
at the time when you
graduated from law school?

32:17.080 --> 32:19.470
- I was.
- Did Amy ever ask you...

32:19.495 --> 32:21.501
about the possibility of her parents

32:21.526 --> 32:23.546
investing in your parents' fund?

32:23.571 --> 32:24.789
She asked about it.

32:24.790 --> 32:28.233
And I told her that to start an account,

32:28.234 --> 32:31.046
it-it was a minimum of $200,000.

32:31.071 --> 32:32.749
Her parents didn't
have that kind of money.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.189
According to my information,
and I could be wrong...

32:35.214 --> 32:37.993
uh, your parents did make
exceptions to that requirement.

32:38.018 --> 32:40.330
- Is that a question?
- No.

32:40.331 --> 32:41.923
This is one.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.060
Did you ever ask if an
exception could be made

32:45.085 --> 32:47.085
in the case of Amy's parents?

32:54.827 --> 32:56.669
Oh. Sorry.

32:57.187 --> 32:58.855
Why would she lie?

32:58.880 --> 33:00.148
I don't know.

33:00.173 --> 33:02.265
She's such a naughty minx.

33:02.290 --> 33:03.851
It could be her idea of a joke.

33:03.876 --> 33:06.390
Mr. Sweeney, please take this seriously.

33:06.984 --> 33:10.312
I imagine a felony
arrest for drug possession

33:10.337 --> 33:11.615
could get her deported.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.038
I'm sorry?

33:13.827 --> 33:16.539
- Who are you again?
- A partner here.

33:16.540 --> 33:19.117
Where does the drug possession come in?

33:19.142 --> 33:21.179
There was nothing in the crime report.

33:21.204 --> 33:22.633
Well, partner,

33:22.658 --> 33:24.242
I'm just theorizing here,

33:24.267 --> 33:27.055
but we were on our
way to a chemsex party

33:27.080 --> 33:29.093
- in Arlington Heights.
- Mm-mm. Wait, wait.

33:29.118 --> 33:30.413
We need to stop right there.

33:30.438 --> 33:32.656
You need to speak in
hypotheticals, Mr. Sweeney.

33:32.681 --> 33:34.234
But... why?

33:34.259 --> 33:35.577
We can't put you on the stand knowing

33:35.602 --> 33:37.413
you will perjure yourself.

33:37.438 --> 33:39.437
You can only relate
something that is true

33:39.462 --> 33:40.640
or potentially true.

33:40.665 --> 33:42.595
God, I love the law.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.329
And everybody takes it so seriously.

33:45.354 --> 33:47.507
- Your party?
- Yes.

33:47.532 --> 33:49.111
Chemsex.

33:51.361 --> 33:53.462
Chemse... No?

33:53.750 --> 33:55.960
Oh, drug cocktails, then sex.

33:55.961 --> 33:57.749
Oh, most enlightening.

33:57.750 --> 33:59.159
- Hypothetically.
- Yes.

33:59.184 --> 34:01.619
Naftali and I were hypothetically

34:01.620 --> 34:04.169
on our way to this
party, where we were...

34:04.170 --> 34:07.039
hypothetically going to
supply the synthetic cathinone.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.260
And why was there no mention

34:08.284 --> 34:09.918
of drugs in the police report?

34:09.943 --> 34:11.699
Naftali threw them out the window

34:11.724 --> 34:13.184
when we were stopped.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.215
Uh... hypothetically.

34:15.239 --> 34:16.762
Adrian.

34:20.716 --> 34:22.246
I think we're in trouble.

34:22.271 --> 34:25.402
I was scanning police calls,
following Theroux's movements.

34:25.427 --> 34:28.289
He was calling for some K9 units
to the scene of the pullover.

34:28.290 --> 34:29.349
Fuck.

34:29.373 --> 34:31.164
- They found them?
- Yeah.

34:31.188 --> 34:33.833
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

34:34.685 --> 34:37.619
When the facts are on your
side, you pound the facts.

34:38.114 --> 34:40.739
When the facts are not on your side...

34:41.661 --> 34:43.185
Come on. Are you kidding me?

34:43.210 --> 34:45.435
Counselor, sit down right now.

34:45.460 --> 34:46.911
You'll get your turn.

34:46.937 --> 34:48.434
Continue, Mr. ASA

34:48.458 --> 34:49.802
Again, Officer Theroux,

34:49.827 --> 34:51.668
did you conduct a search
this morning in an area

34:51.670 --> 34:54.091
immediately adjacent to
the Dan Ryan Expressway?

34:54.116 --> 34:55.880
- I did.
- And what occasioned that search?

34:55.905 --> 34:58.249
The night before, I witnessed
an object being thrown

34:58.250 --> 34:59.819
from the passenger side
of the suspect's car...

34:59.844 --> 35:02.539
Come on! Why did he not search
the night before, Your Honor?

35:02.540 --> 35:03.959
This is bullshit!

35:03.960 --> 35:05.579
Sir, you will stop right now

35:05.580 --> 35:08.169
or we will discuss contempt charges.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.709
- Go ahead.
- Well, that is a good question.

35:10.710 --> 35:12.819
Why didn't you search
the area the night before?

35:12.844 --> 35:15.619
I did. But there's thick
brush there and a gully.

35:15.620 --> 35:16.983
I couldn't find anything.

35:17.008 --> 35:18.579
So I went back with a
K9 unit this morning...

35:18.580 --> 35:20.209
Talk about a convenient memory.

35:20.234 --> 35:21.905
Ma'am. No.

35:21.930 --> 35:23.022
Thank you, Your Honor.

35:23.047 --> 35:24.756
Please, tell the court what,

35:24.781 --> 35:26.225
if anything, you found.

35:26.226 --> 35:28.012
A white plastic bag,

35:28.037 --> 35:31.622
containing approximately 1.5
grams of a synthetic cathinone

35:31.623 --> 35:33.380
commonly known as bath salts.

35:33.405 --> 35:35.311
- Nothing further.
- Why aren't they introducing

35:35.336 --> 35:37.209
the dashboard cam into evidence?

35:37.234 --> 35:39.169
Mr. Boseman, Ms. Lockhart,

35:39.170 --> 35:41.247
are you both done pounding your table?

35:41.272 --> 35:42.749
I apologize, Your Honor.

35:42.750 --> 35:46.039
But given the significance of
the officer's new testimony,

35:46.540 --> 35:48.118
I'm curious why we're not seeing

35:48.143 --> 35:50.682
his dashboard video of the encounter.

35:50.707 --> 35:53.098
Good question. Mr. ASA?

35:53.123 --> 35:55.438
Your Honor, there's nothing
exculpatory on that recording.

35:55.463 --> 35:56.798
Oh, well, that's a relief, Your Honor.

35:56.823 --> 35:58.587
My guess is you would like to see it.

35:58.612 --> 36:00.046
If it's not too much trouble.

36:00.071 --> 36:01.251
The State has three hours

36:01.276 --> 36:03.827
to provide Defense with
the dashboard video.

36:03.852 --> 36:05.634
Adjourned.

37:22.330 --> 37:23.739
Huh.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.739
Hey, you want a rental, you
got to talk to the office.

37:30.764 --> 37:32.103
No, I need a name.

37:32.128 --> 37:33.975
Uh, last night, you drove someone.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.645
A man in a suit.

37:36.707 --> 37:38.035
This man.

37:42.069 --> 37:43.671
- What'd he do?
- Nothing.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.580
He's a witness to a car accident.

37:47.241 --> 37:48.666
Richard Hess.

37:48.691 --> 37:49.772
Where was he headed?

37:49.797 --> 37:51.500
Some party in Arlington Heights.

37:59.620 --> 38:01.580
How are you, Rich?

38:02.165 --> 38:03.280
Do I know you?

38:03.392 --> 38:04.955
Uh, I don't think we've officially met,

38:04.980 --> 38:06.752
but I know you know Colin Sweeney,

38:06.777 --> 38:09.356
and I think he may need you
to testify on his behalf.

38:09.381 --> 38:10.931
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.244
Come on, man.

38:12.269 --> 38:14.635
He was leading you to a
party in Arlington Heights...

38:14.660 --> 38:16.249
the chemsex party...

38:16.250 --> 38:17.749
but his car got pulled over.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.822
This is you on the dashboard videotape.

38:19.847 --> 38:21.346
You waited a few minutes for them,

38:21.371 --> 38:23.080
but then told the driver to keep going.

38:23.105 --> 38:25.211
Since you're obviously a little dense,

38:25.236 --> 38:27.299
let me dumb it down for you.

38:28.327 --> 38:30.017
Fuck off.

38:31.218 --> 38:33.291
This guy definitely saw something,

38:33.316 --> 38:34.377
but he won't testify.

38:34.402 --> 38:36.094
- Can we pay him?
- Mr. Sweeney.

38:36.119 --> 38:37.169
Hypothetically.

38:37.170 --> 38:38.619
We can treat him as a hostile witness.

38:38.644 --> 38:39.674
Why won't he testify?

38:39.699 --> 38:40.752
He doesn't want it to come out

38:40.777 --> 38:42.275
that he was going where he was going.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.346
And where was that?

38:43.371 --> 38:45.236
The sex party Mr. Sweeney was going to.

38:45.261 --> 38:47.467
Hmm. What's his name?

38:47.492 --> 38:48.931
Richard Hess.

38:49.668 --> 38:50.803
Why? You know him?

38:50.828 --> 38:54.383
No. You will not put him on the stand.

38:54.408 --> 38:56.188
You have no right!

38:56.213 --> 38:58.111
What are you talking about?
He saw what happened.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.891
You don't know that.

38:59.916 --> 39:03.229
I insist that you not contact him again,

39:03.254 --> 39:05.314
or I'm hiring other lawyers.

39:08.295 --> 39:09.617
So you did beat up that cop?

39:09.642 --> 39:11.225
No. What? No.

39:11.259 --> 39:12.531
Why don't you want us to get this guy?

39:12.556 --> 39:13.898
Because I don't need a reason.

39:13.923 --> 39:15.437
I'll be in your office, Diane.

39:19.904 --> 39:21.709
I think I understand.

39:21.710 --> 39:22.803
What? I don't.

39:22.828 --> 39:25.374
Richard Hess is a Florida
real estate billionaire

39:25.399 --> 39:27.975
who's been sent to Chicago to vet...

39:28.000 --> 39:30.006
ambassadors.

39:36.618 --> 39:38.468
Oh, don't act like that.

39:38.493 --> 39:39.805
What's the point of being rich

39:39.830 --> 39:41.704
if you can't buy what's for sale?

39:41.729 --> 39:42.970
An ambassadorship?

39:42.995 --> 39:45.142
I gave over a million dollars

39:45.167 --> 39:46.537
to his campaign PAC.

39:46.562 --> 39:48.561
Membership has its privileges.

39:48.573 --> 39:50.360
So work your magic...

39:50.385 --> 39:52.289
and make these charges go away.

39:52.314 --> 39:53.337
I need to look clean.

39:53.362 --> 39:54.750
Then get Hess to testify

39:54.775 --> 39:56.111
on your behalf.

39:56.136 --> 39:58.243
This drug testimony
from Theroux hurts you.

39:58.268 --> 40:00.249
No. Find another way.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.742
Police brutality is your specialty,

40:02.767 --> 40:05.201
and I'm a bona fide victim here!

40:05.226 --> 40:08.351
It's not just the black
people who get brutalized.

40:08.376 --> 40:11.883
It's people like me...
the misunderstood.

40:12.328 --> 40:14.867
The white billionaire wife-killer,

40:14.892 --> 40:16.585
allegedly.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.540
Oh, God.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.000
Maia.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.701
She's trying to suggest you
knew about the Ponzi Scheme,

40:33.726 --> 40:35.512
and that's why you
waived Amy's parents off.

40:35.537 --> 40:37.176
- Yeah. I know.
- Did you?

40:37.201 --> 40:38.365
No.

40:38.787 --> 40:40.709
You don't sound definite.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.848
Did you tell him my father's
IRA comes to $110,000,

40:46.920 --> 40:48.959
that he's got another
$30,000 in T-Bills?

40:48.960 --> 40:50.240
Uh-huh.

40:52.172 --> 40:53.363
I don't know. I...

40:53.388 --> 40:55.879
You don't know if you
waived Amy's parents off?

40:56.168 --> 40:58.232
I know this has been hard...

41:00.912 --> 41:02.451
I know these months
have been hard on you,

41:02.476 --> 41:03.803
and you feel, rightly or wrongly,

41:03.828 --> 41:05.169
guilty for your parents' actions.

41:05.170 --> 41:06.348
No, that's not what this is.

41:06.373 --> 41:08.301
You don't even need to
be conscious of it, Maia.

41:08.326 --> 41:10.749
Your guilt could just be
coloring your memories.

41:10.750 --> 41:14.199
You could be seeing yourself
as more culpable than you are.

41:14.485 --> 41:16.426
It's your Catholic guilt.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.402
You are condemning yourself.

41:19.427 --> 41:20.856
That's fine for the confessional,

41:20.881 --> 41:22.197
but here, it has real repercussions.

41:22.222 --> 41:25.113
They could put you in jail.

41:27.210 --> 41:29.749
Your father'd really turn down $140,000?

41:29.750 --> 41:32.598
Ah. Well, he does it all the time.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.620
Did you really tell your dad?

41:44.404 --> 41:47.083
Lucca, I didn't tell my dad.

41:47.608 --> 41:49.248
Didn't tell him what?

41:49.580 --> 41:51.811
About Amy's parents' investment.

41:52.005 --> 41:54.092
I pretended to, but...

41:54.117 --> 41:55.928
I never told him.

41:58.409 --> 42:01.047
What do you mean?
Of course I told my dad.

42:01.072 --> 42:02.490
Why wouldn't I?

42:08.928 --> 42:10.619
Okay, this isn't good.

42:11.334 --> 42:13.092
You're ready to admit you killed Biggie.

42:13.117 --> 42:15.829
I must have somehow known
about the Ponzi scheme.

42:15.830 --> 42:18.365
Otherwise, why wouldn't I
have let Amy's parents invest?

42:18.390 --> 42:21.592
- That doesn't mean anything.
- It does, Lucca.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.415
I knew.

42:37.250 --> 42:38.879
The problem is the drugs.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.039
Judge was listening to
us on everything else.

42:41.040 --> 42:44.004
It's the drugs thrown
out the freaking window.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.539
So we use Hess.

42:46.178 --> 42:48.715
We convince Sweeney he
has to use his vetter.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.647
No. We need to go at the drugs, Diane.

42:52.545 --> 42:54.254
That helps us with COPA, too.

42:54.279 --> 42:56.528
They want to kick Theroux off the force.

42:56.553 --> 42:57.710
We just...

42:59.256 --> 43:01.635
we haven't given 'em
enough of a reason to do it.

43:01.636 --> 43:03.858
Then we're stuck.

43:09.314 --> 43:10.873
Diane?

43:11.073 --> 43:12.477
You happy here?

43:12.478 --> 43:15.112
- What, at your firm?
- Yeah.

43:15.151 --> 43:17.799
- Yes. Why?
- I don't know.

43:18.002 --> 43:20.291
You wanted to retire.

43:20.581 --> 43:21.815
Yes.

43:22.766 --> 43:26.915
Well, life has a way of
reminding you of who you are.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.048
Mm.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.357
Guess I'm not the retiring type.

43:31.268 --> 43:33.097
Are you happy here?

43:37.651 --> 43:38.782
Gotcha.

43:38.807 --> 43:40.080
I like...

43:40.468 --> 43:42.917
getting the better of people, and...

43:43.658 --> 43:45.768
keeping something alive.

43:46.018 --> 43:47.221
You know?

43:47.246 --> 43:48.329
Look out there

43:48.354 --> 43:50.274
at all those employees, and...

43:50.306 --> 43:52.339
realizing they might not have jobs

43:52.364 --> 43:53.783
if I don't keep this going.

43:53.807 --> 43:56.143
Yeah. That is a good feeling.

43:58.910 --> 44:00.238
Okay.

44:00.495 --> 44:02.222
Time to go home.

44:03.511 --> 44:05.129
Let's get dinner sometime.

44:05.154 --> 44:06.443
Okay?

44:06.444 --> 44:07.943
That'd be nice.

44:08.760 --> 44:09.957
Yeah.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.483
Possession.

44:18.508 --> 44:20.704
It was possession!

44:20.729 --> 44:21.800
- Stupid!
- What?

44:21.825 --> 44:23.236
I am so stupid.

44:23.261 --> 44:24.839
It was right there in front of our eyes.

44:24.894 --> 44:26.915
- What was?
- What is his name?

44:26.940 --> 44:29.001
- Uh, uh...
- Oh.

44:29.026 --> 44:30.778
Um, um, um...

44:31.229 --> 44:32.940
Todd Knutsen.

44:33.140 --> 44:34.987
Are you familiar with...

44:35.012 --> 44:38.073
Officer Andrew Theroux, Mr. Knutsen?

44:38.098 --> 44:39.152
Oh, yeah.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.432
He's the one that pulled
me over a few nights ago.

44:41.457 --> 44:42.816
Would you tell the court what happened?

44:42.841 --> 44:45.143
I was driving home from my mom's house.

44:45.168 --> 44:47.432
He pulled me over, said
I was switching lanes

44:47.457 --> 44:48.745
without signaling.

44:48.770 --> 44:50.025
I wasn't.

44:50.050 --> 44:52.596
He asked me to step out of
the car so he could search it.

44:52.621 --> 44:54.057
Then he handcuffs me and says

44:54.082 --> 44:56.315
I'm under arrest for
possession of heroin.

44:56.340 --> 44:58.179
Were you in possession of heroin?

44:58.204 --> 45:00.174
No, he planted it.

45:00.222 --> 45:02.464
In fact, weren't the
charges eventually dropped?

45:02.489 --> 45:04.487
Yeah, just today.

45:04.519 --> 45:06.276
The other cops say this
happens a lot with him.

45:06.301 --> 45:07.471
Objection, Your Honor...

45:07.496 --> 45:09.182
Yes, sustained.

45:09.207 --> 45:11.073
But you might want to reconsider

45:11.098 --> 45:13.615
your charge here, Mr. ASA

45:13.640 --> 45:15.667
Nothing further, Your Honor. Thank you.

45:15.692 --> 45:17.081
Mr. McGrath?

45:17.106 --> 45:18.198
Nothing further.

45:18.223 --> 45:20.690
The witness is dismissed.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.799
Thank you.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.471
Thanks.

45:26.283 --> 45:27.533
Uh...

45:30.018 --> 45:32.104
That's really not necessary.

45:44.086 --> 45:45.657
It's no big deal.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.680
It's a SEC audit. Of
course it's a big deal.

45:47.705 --> 45:50.703
- Would you two be quiet?
- Come on. Jax.

45:50.728 --> 45:53.156
Hey, hon. We'll be right out.

45:56.453 --> 45:58.665
I don't think we should
entangle your parents' money

45:58.690 --> 46:00.406
with my parents'.

46:07.124 --> 46:09.432
Is there something wrong with the fund?

46:14.969 --> 46:16.315
Are you good?

46:18.245 --> 46:20.124
I don't know.

46:21.463 --> 46:23.494
Listen, Maia,

46:23.970 --> 46:25.424
I can think of a dozen reasons

46:25.449 --> 46:27.736
why you didn't let Amy's parents invest.

46:27.761 --> 46:29.455
First and foremost, you
didn't want to mix up

46:29.480 --> 46:31.229
finances with love.

46:32.166 --> 46:34.580
That makes complete sense to me.

46:34.605 --> 46:35.979
You think so?

46:36.004 --> 46:37.737
Yeah, I do.

46:39.259 --> 46:41.018
You ready again?

46:41.052 --> 46:42.565
Last dentist visit.

46:43.736 --> 46:45.009
J.K.

46:45.322 --> 46:47.080
That's "just kidding."

46:47.105 --> 46:48.908
It's what the kids say.

46:53.397 --> 46:55.846
I wanted to thank you for you help.

46:56.090 --> 46:57.360
You're welcome.

46:57.385 --> 46:58.578
And I wanted to let you know

46:58.603 --> 47:01.211
that no good deed goes unpunished.

47:01.302 --> 47:03.641
About an hour ago, some
billionaire was named

47:03.666 --> 47:05.915
the next ambassador to Germany.

47:05.940 --> 47:07.344
I lost it.

47:07.408 --> 47:08.516
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:08.541 --> 47:09.644
I can't believe I wasted

47:09.669 --> 47:11.828
four months trying to learn German.

47:11.853 --> 47:13.930
Ich. Nicht.

47:14.438 --> 47:16.594
Well, I'm sure you'll survive.

47:16.619 --> 47:19.539
Also, it'll free you up for
our lawsuit against Cook County.

47:19.564 --> 47:21.149
Theroux's been kicked off the force,

47:21.174 --> 47:23.213
but we've got a six million
dollar civil suit in the works.

47:23.238 --> 47:26.024
Uh, no, I'm not doing that.

47:26.555 --> 47:28.446
- Uh, yes, you are.
- No.

47:28.471 --> 47:29.539
Sorry.

47:29.564 --> 47:32.649
I'm trying for
Ambassador to the Vatican.

47:32.880 --> 47:35.258
Again, thanks.

47:36.093 --> 47:38.163
I'll drop by again.

47:45.230 --> 47:47.538
Are you ready to finish this up, Maia?

47:48.504 --> 47:49.569
She is.

47:49.594 --> 47:52.679
You asked me why I
didn't want Amy's parents

47:52.704 --> 47:54.499
to invest in the fund.

47:54.524 --> 47:57.273
And the truth is, it just
seemed like a bad idea

47:57.298 --> 47:59.514
to mix family and finances.

48:17.222 --> 48:19.419
In my experience, Maia,

48:19.844 --> 48:22.341
whenever somebody says, "The truth is,"

48:22.366 --> 48:24.125
that usually means it's not.

48:24.150 --> 48:26.067
- That's not...
- I like you, Maia.

48:26.092 --> 48:27.904
I think you're smart,

48:27.929 --> 48:29.974
I think you're perceptive,

48:29.999 --> 48:32.600
and I think you committed a crime here.

48:33.577 --> 48:36.538
I think you knew about
your parents' Ponzi scheme,

48:36.850 --> 48:38.589
and I'm going to recommend prosecution

48:38.590 --> 48:39.835
by the U.S. Attorney's Office.

48:39.860 --> 48:40.936
This was a proffer session!

48:40.961 --> 48:43.525
Yes, but she lied.

48:43.550 --> 48:45.178
I'm sorry.
