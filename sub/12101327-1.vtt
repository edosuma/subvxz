01:02.285 --> 01:04.643
Leaves exactly 30 days.

01:04.644 --> 01:06.983
I'm not thrilled about
this in the least, but-

01:06.985 --> 01:08.983
- Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Bruce.

01:08.985 --> 01:13.043
But I was going to
say, if you'd let me finish,

01:13.045 --> 01:16.823
I do believe in you, and
I know if you concentrate

01:16.825 --> 01:17.813
you can get this.

01:17.815 --> 01:19.133
I do not need a pep talk.

01:19.135 --> 01:22.771
Which, by the way, you are terrible at.

01:22.773 --> 01:24.573
I've got the ending all figured out.

01:25.415 --> 01:26.823
I'm gonna do the work, no sweat.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.163
I'm just gonna cruise.

01:28.165 --> 01:30.443
At least you can
give me a hint at what-

01:30.445 --> 01:31.303
- No spoilers.

01:31.305 --> 01:32.253
You'll be happy, hombre.

01:32.255 --> 01:33.363
Trust me.

01:33.365 --> 01:34.743
That's all I can do.

01:34.745 --> 01:36.353
Please don't screw this up.

01:36.355 --> 01:37.693
Arabella?

01:37.695 --> 01:38.688
Now, seriously.

01:40.275 --> 01:41.303
Stay in touch.

01:41.305 --> 01:43.028
Will do, Bruce No-chillis.

01:44.235 --> 01:45.512
Talk soon.

01:45.514 --> 01:46.347
Jesus.

03:52.255 --> 03:53.548
Hey.

03:53.550 --> 03:54.558
You need a hand?

03:56.055 --> 03:57.163
No, I got it.

03:57.165 --> 03:58.023
Thanks.

03:58.025 --> 03:59.453
You on the road somewhere?

03:59.455 --> 04:01.023
Are you staying close by?

04:01.025 --> 04:02.073
Just traveling.

04:02.075 --> 04:02.908
See ya.

09:40.215 --> 09:41.153
Marin?

09:41.155 --> 09:42.383
Thank God.

09:42.385 --> 09:43.600
What is up, girl?

09:43.602 --> 09:45.058
Yeah, I'm alive.

09:46.445 --> 09:47.963
Yeah.

09:47.965 --> 09:48.798
No.

09:49.855 --> 09:50.963
It's not as bad as I remember.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.168
My mom apparently had
it cleaned or whatever.

09:55.735 --> 09:59.033
Well, yeah, I'd love to have
you here, but the whole point

09:59.035 --> 10:01.813
of total isolation is so that I could...

10:01.815 --> 10:02.763
Yes.

10:02.765 --> 10:05.315
I even had my mom canceled
the TV and the internet.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.568
He what?

10:09.705 --> 10:11.178
He literally texted you that.

10:12.295 --> 10:14.318
What a monster sack of douche.

10:16.985 --> 10:17.818
You what?

10:19.135 --> 10:20.698
That is the perfect gif.

10:22.575 --> 10:24.453
It's definitely less
personal, but still has

10:24.455 --> 10:26.263
those angsty elements.

10:26.265 --> 10:27.965
Yeah, it's got that vibe for sure.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.693
The elevator pitch is that
it's about a bucolic girl

10:32.695 --> 10:36.543
who goes to the big, bad city,
finds some roommates online,

10:36.545 --> 10:38.853
and then just when she starts
fitting in, they go missing,

10:38.855 --> 10:41.305
and she becomes a suspect
in their disappearance.

10:42.495 --> 10:45.813
Yeah, I have a few ideas for the ending.

10:45.815 --> 10:46.788
Nothing concrete.

10:48.135 --> 10:48.968
Nothing good.

10:49.835 --> 10:50.666
Yeah.

10:50.668 --> 10:51.743
I probably have to lose my mind a little

10:51.745 --> 10:54.045
before I can think of
anything halfway decent.

10:55.045 --> 10:55.880
Yeah.

10:55.882 --> 10:56.928
"Shining"-style.

10:59.265 --> 11:00.268
I hope it goes well.

11:02.185 --> 11:03.895
Wow, man, I...

11:06.155 --> 11:06.986
Thank you.

11:06.988 --> 11:09.333
I needed this.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.428
I'm gonna try again.

11:11.995 --> 11:12.983
Love you, girl.

11:12.985 --> 11:13.818
Bye.

13:37.267 --> 13:38.952
Come on, you dumb idiot.

13:38.954 --> 13:39.787
Write.

13:40.784 --> 13:41.617
Something.

15:12.917 --> 15:13.750
Come on.

20:24.604 --> 20:25.437
Fuck this.

20:46.669 --> 20:47.502
The fuck?

21:19.375 --> 21:20.958
Hi, are you okay?

21:22.135 --> 21:24.043
Oh, sorry, I'm Eban.

21:24.045 --> 21:26.033
I'm staying nextdoor.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.253
I really didn't mean to freak you out.

21:27.255 --> 21:29.613
I'll go if you're...

21:29.615 --> 21:30.448
Nextdoor?

21:31.755 --> 21:33.973
The next cabin over, it's like

21:33.975 --> 21:35.188
an acre and a half that way.

21:37.145 --> 21:39.455
I heard something last night, but...

21:51.465 --> 21:52.713
What?

21:52.715 --> 21:53.548
Huh?

21:54.895 --> 21:57.696
You said you heard
something last night, but?

21:57.698 --> 22:00.903
Oh, but I was too lazy
to come check it out.

22:00.905 --> 22:03.423
Plus it can be creepy as
hell out here at night.

22:03.425 --> 22:04.563
Mm-hmm.

22:04.565 --> 22:07.953
But why are you here?

22:07.955 --> 22:09.223
Nextdoor, I mean.

22:09.225 --> 22:10.923
Oh, come every summer.

22:10.925 --> 22:13.073
Since I was a kid, I used to with my dad,

22:13.075 --> 22:13.975
we kept the place.

22:19.685 --> 22:20.698
And you are?

22:22.135 --> 22:22.968
Arabella.

22:24.435 --> 22:26.703
So what brings you all the way out here?

22:26.705 --> 22:27.536
Work.

22:27.538 --> 22:30.343
I'm trying to finish something
without any distractions.

22:30.345 --> 22:32.613
Oh, this is definitely
a good place for that.

22:32.615 --> 22:34.493
But if you need a signal,
you can actually go-

22:34.495 --> 22:35.326
- Yeah.

22:35.328 --> 22:37.068
I already found it.

22:38.515 --> 22:41.135
So last night, did I hear you...

22:43.415 --> 22:44.246
Don't worry about it.

22:44.248 --> 22:45.079
I had a nightmare.

22:45.081 --> 22:47.028
I freaked myself out.

22:47.990 --> 22:48.823
About what?

22:51.195 --> 22:52.763
You can help me, though.

22:52.765 --> 22:53.773
Sure, what's up?

22:53.775 --> 22:54.723
I'm kinda out of gas.

22:54.725 --> 22:56.153
Do you have any?

22:56.155 --> 22:57.883
I mean, I don't have
any, but I'm about to head

22:57.885 --> 22:58.963
into town in a little bit.

22:58.965 --> 23:00.483
I could pick you up a couple gallons.

23:00.485 --> 23:01.353
I have a container.

23:01.355 --> 23:03.653
That would literally save my life.

23:03.655 --> 23:04.488
Literally?

23:06.365 --> 23:07.293
I don't know why I said that.

23:07.295 --> 23:09.483
I hate when people say that.

23:09.485 --> 23:12.036
I'm just being funny, but yeah.

23:12.038 --> 23:13.748
It's no problem at all, Arabella.

23:14.645 --> 23:16.088
Do you have like a nickname?

23:16.965 --> 23:17.953
No.

23:17.955 --> 23:19.413
Why, you don't like my name?

23:19.415 --> 23:20.343
No, I love it.

23:20.345 --> 23:22.345
It's just, you know, kind of a mouthful.

23:25.085 --> 23:25.916
Okay.

23:25.918 --> 23:27.153
Well I just have to take
care of a couple things

23:27.155 --> 23:30.313
and I'll get you that gas,
unless you need it right now,

23:30.315 --> 23:31.148
I could...

23:33.615 --> 23:34.623
No, it's fine.

23:34.625 --> 23:35.458
Whenever.

23:37.205 --> 23:38.038
I'll be here

23:39.235 --> 23:40.066
Okay.

23:40.068 --> 23:40.899
I'll see you in a bit.

23:40.901 --> 23:42.195
I can give you some cash.

25:20.085 --> 25:21.703
Hey Bruce.

25:21.705 --> 25:22.538
What's up?

25:24.985 --> 25:25.818
They what?

25:27.995 --> 25:29.155
But why would they...

25:30.355 --> 25:31.188
You what?

25:33.355 --> 25:35.505
But we agreed to send
them the completed...

25:40.595 --> 25:41.488
I spent it all.

25:45.885 --> 25:48.558
If I could kill the
messenger right now, I would.

25:50.125 --> 25:50.958
No.

25:52.805 --> 25:54.283
It's fine.

25:54.285 --> 25:55.208
It's not.

25:56.825 --> 25:57.658
I'm leaving.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.003
Well, as soon as my car...

26:02.005 --> 26:03.503
It doesn't matter.

26:03.505 --> 26:04.915
This place, it's...

26:06.645 --> 26:07.883
Nevermind.

26:07.885 --> 26:08.716
Just tell them to sit tight.

26:08.718 --> 26:10.713
I'll get you this damn draft.

26:10.715 --> 26:12.063
Yeah.

26:12.065 --> 26:12.898
Bye.

26:47.425 --> 26:48.258
You made it.

26:49.206 --> 26:50.643
I did.

26:50.645 --> 26:51.476
Is it-

26:51.478 --> 26:53.755
- Yeah, it's just on the
inside of the door there.

26:58.705 --> 27:00.183
Seriously, thank you so much.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.518
It's nothing.

27:03.915 --> 27:06.533
So how long are you gonna be here for?

27:06.535 --> 27:08.423
Well, I'm actually leaving right now.

27:08.425 --> 27:09.643
That's why I kinda needed the-

27:09.645 --> 27:11.073
- If I knew you were about to blow town

27:11.075 --> 27:13.025
I never would have gotten this for you.

27:13.975 --> 27:15.843
No, really though, what's the rush?

27:15.845 --> 27:16.676
I just need to leave.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.543
I need to get the work I
finished back to my editor.

27:19.545 --> 27:21.093
I...

27:21.095 --> 27:21.928
What?

27:24.265 --> 27:26.843
Oh, Jesus Christ on a fucking cracker.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.643
Do you have a spare?

27:28.645 --> 27:29.518
I think so.

27:33.795 --> 27:35.763
It looks cut.

27:35.765 --> 27:38.223
You don't have any like
enemies around here, do you?

27:38.225 --> 27:40.203
I haven't been here since I was 12.

27:40.205 --> 27:43.203
Well, I bet you were a
pretty spunky 12 year old, too.

27:43.205 --> 27:44.455
Classic victim blaming.

27:45.545 --> 27:46.845
Pop the trunk, will you?

27:58.695 --> 28:00.473
You've done this before, right?

28:00.475 --> 28:02.018
Yeah, like once.

28:03.055 --> 28:04.203
All right, mountain man.

28:04.205 --> 28:05.038
Can I help?

28:06.095 --> 28:06.928
Probably.

28:09.875 --> 28:11.668
So what's the verdict here?

28:14.455 --> 28:16.093
The jack can't grip the car without

28:16.095 --> 28:17.403
sinking into the ground.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.113
It's all the rain we've had.

28:19.115 --> 28:19.978
It's mush.

28:21.555 --> 28:24.433
Probably gonna have to call
for a tow out to the main road.

28:24.435 --> 28:25.923
Super.

28:25.925 --> 28:27.093
I'd call for one for you now,

28:27.095 --> 28:28.483
but I know how they are around here.

28:28.485 --> 28:31.193
You're not gonna get anybody
out this far till morning.

28:31.195 --> 28:32.557
No, it's okay.

28:32.559 --> 28:34.533
I'll call myself.

28:34.535 --> 28:35.366
Do you have-

28:35.368 --> 28:37.098
There are emergency numbers inside.

28:38.530 --> 28:41.103
Well, if they're out
of date or something,

28:41.105 --> 28:43.205
I'm just like a five minute walk that way.

28:44.815 --> 28:45.685
Do you...

28:47.302 --> 28:48.135
What?

28:49.867 --> 28:50.700
Nothing.

28:52.135 --> 28:53.193
You sure?

28:53.195 --> 28:54.743
Yeah, everything's fine.

28:54.745 --> 28:56.023
Maybe I'll come say hi in the morning.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.183
Thanks again so much for your help.

28:58.185 --> 29:01.743
If something is, I don't
know, wrong, you can tell me

29:01.745 --> 29:03.145
Everything is peachy keen.

29:05.885 --> 29:06.716
All right.

29:06.718 --> 29:08.993
Well, like I said, I'll be there tonight.

29:08.995 --> 29:10.093
- See ya.
- Bye.

29:10.095 --> 29:10.928
Thank you.

30:26.534 --> 30:29.015
About time.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.358
You're fucking dead.

30:39.525 --> 30:41.473
They said you're the smart here.

30:41.475 --> 30:42.425
What do you want?

30:43.335 --> 30:44.518
Arabella, listen.

30:45.525 --> 30:46.775
I don't want to hurt you.

30:47.635 --> 30:49.585
I just needed to make contact with you.

30:50.891 --> 30:51.724
Why?

30:52.795 --> 30:54.558
I think we can help each other.

30:56.275 --> 30:57.225
What do you mean?

30:58.295 --> 31:00.433
I know this is beyond lunacy,

31:00.435 --> 31:02.943
and it took me a long time
to even remotely understand

31:02.945 --> 31:04.338
what was happening to me.

31:05.325 --> 31:07.243
But here I am.

31:07.245 --> 31:09.745
And I've been waiting for
someone to connect with.

31:11.508 --> 31:12.558
I don't understand.

31:14.115 --> 31:15.315
Come sit here, please.

31:17.165 --> 31:18.715
I'll tell you everything I can.

31:21.595 --> 31:22.785
Sit, please.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.238
Oh, sorry.

31:43.085 --> 31:44.468
I won't that anymore.

31:45.465 --> 31:47.204
Arabella, look.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.688
Whatever you heard
about me, it's not true.

31:52.084 --> 31:53.968
I didn't kill myself.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.333
So how did you...

31:59.335 --> 32:02.113
Someone did this to me.

32:02.115 --> 32:03.858
We have to figure out who.

32:05.565 --> 32:08.863
But why do you think that I...

32:08.865 --> 32:12.013
Because we have something that binds us.

32:12.015 --> 32:17.015
Our minds, our art, the written word.

32:18.225 --> 32:21.738
But I really don't understand
what you're saying, Vivian.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.983
I know you're having a rough time here,

32:24.985 --> 32:27.583
and I can help you.

32:27.585 --> 32:28.418
How?

32:31.565 --> 32:32.708
I have an idea.

32:34.665 --> 32:35.565
Okay.

32:36.425 --> 32:39.873
I know how to end your book.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.618
I can finish it for you.

32:42.685 --> 32:45.265
And in exchange...

32:46.615 --> 32:48.863
You want...

32:48.865 --> 32:51.813
For you to find my killer.

32:51.815 --> 32:54.148
Find proof of what they did.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.188
But why?

32:59.145 --> 33:02.333
Because once my name is cleared,

33:02.335 --> 33:06.763
then I can finally move
on to the next plane.

33:06.765 --> 33:08.958
That is what I've learned intrinsically.

33:10.505 --> 33:13.008
I need them brought to
justice in some way.

33:15.235 --> 33:16.288
Then I'll be free.

33:17.455 --> 33:21.588
Spiritually, astrally, metaphysically.

33:22.465 --> 33:24.673
I need to transcend this form.

33:24.675 --> 33:26.413
Move on to the next.

33:26.415 --> 33:27.848
I'll be free of this place.

33:33.265 --> 33:34.758
You died here.

33:37.503 --> 33:39.906
No one fucking told me that.

33:39.908 --> 33:44.833
I don't think my mother
wanted your mom to know.

33:44.835 --> 33:48.098
I think she just, she was ashamed.

33:51.205 --> 33:52.185
So...

33:54.459 --> 33:55.568
Where would we start?

34:05.625 --> 34:06.703
And then?

34:06.705 --> 34:07.888
That's the problem.

34:08.784 --> 34:12.047
I can't remember any details after that.

34:12.975 --> 34:16.083
I think the memory's repressed.

34:16.085 --> 34:20.237
Stuck, floating, helplessly,
my decent body subconscious.

34:21.925 --> 34:23.838
There was a brief flicker.

34:25.185 --> 34:26.507
Still very cloudy.

34:28.605 --> 34:30.848
But I remember looking down at myself.

34:31.985 --> 34:33.735
My freshly dead body.

34:35.306 --> 34:39.428
My eyes were wide open, staring at me.

34:41.554 --> 34:44.643
There was a frothy mixture of blood,

34:44.645 --> 34:47.998
regurgitated chemicals oozing of my mouth.

34:49.324 --> 34:53.663
An empty bottle of Drano still clutched

34:53.665 --> 34:56.748
in my limp, lifeless hand.

34:57.815 --> 35:01.593
Whoever arranged it,
they knew if I was found

35:01.595 --> 35:04.888
with nearly a gallon
of Drano in my system,

35:05.725 --> 35:09.432
it would be an open and shut case.

35:09.434 --> 35:14.434
But I think he poisoned me before that,

35:15.505 --> 35:17.058
to get me to pass out.

35:22.413 --> 35:23.246
And look.

35:25.325 --> 35:26.993
Defensive wounds?

35:26.995 --> 35:27.945
Exactly.

35:29.165 --> 35:30.098
They never heal.

35:32.029 --> 35:33.918
Because they didn't heal in life.

35:37.455 --> 35:39.813
If police procedural shows
have taught me anything,

35:39.815 --> 35:42.013
it's usually the husband or the boyfriend.

35:42.015 --> 35:42.848
You're right.

35:45.057 --> 35:48.273
But I wasn't married and
I didn't have a boyfriend.

35:48.275 --> 35:51.463
But you must've been dating people.

35:51.465 --> 35:52.365
Of course I was.

35:53.275 --> 35:54.375
You're probably right.

35:55.455 --> 35:58.508
You can't trust men, ever.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.358
Ever.

36:03.169 --> 36:05.068
Okay.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.825
So was there anyone in
particular who seemed...

36:14.545 --> 36:15.703
We'll start with the timeline.

36:15.705 --> 36:16.838
You were living here.

36:18.933 --> 36:23.548
Two years up until my
murder, summer of 2018.

36:25.885 --> 36:26.718
Right.

36:27.845 --> 36:29.710
My side of the family, my mother,

36:29.712 --> 36:32.123
said that your mom and Uncle
Tony could have the place

36:32.125 --> 36:35.303
because we weren't taking
family trips anymore.

36:35.305 --> 36:37.013
What'd they say about me?

36:37.015 --> 36:37.846
Who?

36:37.848 --> 36:41.578
Aunt Anna, your mother,
your side of the family.

36:42.525 --> 36:44.863
Just that you were
like, really talented,

36:44.865 --> 36:48.013
and you spent a lot of summers
in Europe with your dad.

36:48.015 --> 36:49.415
That's why I didn't see you.

36:51.305 --> 36:52.138
And?

36:53.036 --> 36:53.869
And...

36:55.125 --> 36:55.958
Troubled.

36:56.875 --> 36:57.708
That so?

36:58.595 --> 37:02.713
I mean, just that you
were like, you know,

37:02.715 --> 37:04.465
having a really rough time with...

37:07.145 --> 37:08.593
I honestly don't know.

37:08.595 --> 37:12.908
I channeled my pain into my art.

37:15.195 --> 37:16.198
It's what we do.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.895
My first book, I...

37:24.155 --> 37:25.985
It was fairly silly.

37:28.755 --> 37:33.755
Not much death, but that's
what people liked, I guess.

37:34.385 --> 37:36.448
You're selling yourself short, kiddo.

37:37.295 --> 37:39.295
There's a lot of personal meat in there.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.123
Tasty morsels.

37:42.125 --> 37:43.298
It's what people liked.

37:44.565 --> 37:45.415
You've read it?

37:46.306 --> 37:48.033
I was proud.

37:48.035 --> 37:49.553
I'm even now.

37:49.555 --> 37:50.386
Proud of me?

37:50.388 --> 37:52.968
But I haven't seen you since I was a kid.

37:54.415 --> 37:57.938
Doesn't mean I didn't
follow your life, your career.

38:01.645 --> 38:02.933
I want to help you, Vivian.

38:02.935 --> 38:04.463
I do.

38:04.465 --> 38:06.583
I just think we need to
be completely transparent

38:06.585 --> 38:07.508
with each other.

38:08.595 --> 38:09.428
I agree.

38:11.355 --> 38:13.955
So why have you been
scaring me the past few days?

38:19.135 --> 38:23.208
To be able to make a true
contact with a living person,

38:25.055 --> 38:27.496
it has to happen incrementally.

38:27.498 --> 38:30.713
All right, why not just leave
a post-it note or something?

38:30.715 --> 38:34.123
Because they don't give you
a goddamn instruction booklet

38:34.125 --> 38:35.118
when you die.

38:37.165 --> 38:40.468
Trying to figure this shit out each day.

38:42.205 --> 38:43.438
Same as you.

38:44.845 --> 38:46.538
Sometimes I'm here.

38:49.092 --> 38:52.172
And other times I don't
even know where I am.

38:59.942 --> 39:00.775
I'm sorry.

39:06.735 --> 39:07.568
No.

39:09.435 --> 39:10.266
It's okay.

39:10.268 --> 39:13.405
We'll just take it slow.

40:03.326 --> 40:04.159
Vivian?

40:38.102 --> 40:38.935
Thanks.

40:45.540 --> 40:46.613
Anything good?

40:46.615 --> 40:47.865
Jesus Christ.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.495
I'm so sorry, Arabella.

40:51.497 --> 40:53.963
You can't do that.

40:53.965 --> 40:55.933
I know, I'm sorry.

40:55.935 --> 40:58.358
I can't always control when I appear.

40:59.265 --> 41:01.115
I guess that's the right terminology?

41:13.355 --> 41:15.093
You were the one that
cut my tire, right?

41:15.095 --> 41:15.928
Made it flat?

41:17.995 --> 41:19.643
Yes.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.048
I needed to keep you here.

41:22.315 --> 41:25.318
So you can move things.

41:26.205 --> 41:27.158
Objects, I mean.

41:28.045 --> 41:30.063
If I try really hard

41:30.065 --> 41:32.253
There are other things.

41:32.255 --> 41:34.513
I think I can change shapes.

41:34.515 --> 41:35.553
I don't know.

41:35.555 --> 41:37.658
Maybe even inhabit another person's body.

41:38.545 --> 41:42.583
Sometimes, I appear in different forms.

41:42.585 --> 41:44.035
I guess depending on my mood.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.318
Okay.

41:49.671 --> 41:50.693
Do you have a phone I could see?

41:50.695 --> 41:53.245
Your actual texts would be
the best place to start.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.685
I don't know where it ended up.

41:58.795 --> 41:59.698
Are you sure?

42:00.535 --> 42:01.898
Cross my heart.

42:03.385 --> 42:05.733
We'll go from the most
recent to the older ones.

42:05.735 --> 42:06.728
Who's Richie?

42:08.015 --> 42:08.848
Nobody.

42:11.165 --> 42:12.853
An art dealer I knew.

42:12.855 --> 42:14.233
Did he have any interest in you?

42:14.235 --> 42:15.236
We need to look at all the-

42:15.238 --> 42:17.733
- He's gay and harmless.

42:17.735 --> 42:19.988
What about Chris?

42:21.215 --> 42:23.493
He's 80, next.

42:23.495 --> 42:27.488
Not leaving any pebbles
unturned, even geriatric ones.

42:33.995 --> 42:37.823
And you never had any friction with her?

42:37.825 --> 42:38.658
No.

42:39.775 --> 42:42.244
She was always kind to me.

42:43.079 --> 42:46.158
Hey, we're making good progress here.

42:47.485 --> 42:48.888
Don't get discouraged.

42:49.985 --> 42:53.663
Okay, so can we talk about my...

42:53.665 --> 42:55.603
Here's how I see it.

42:55.605 --> 42:58.283
You have this rich layer set up.

42:58.285 --> 43:03.285
Real nice neo noir, with
a sharp feminist lens.

43:03.325 --> 43:04.463
But...

43:04.465 --> 43:06.465
But I've painted myself into a corner.

43:07.655 --> 43:09.018
This is not how I see it.

43:10.485 --> 43:13.266
Do you like any of the
three paths I came up with?

43:13.268 --> 43:14.101
No.

43:17.415 --> 43:19.898
We're gonna get meta with this.

43:19.900 --> 43:24.900
Irma can't find any answer
from conventional means.

43:24.945 --> 43:28.443
So on a whim, she goes to a psychic

43:28.445 --> 43:30.038
that she passed on the street.

43:31.055 --> 43:34.983
And this mystical elderly
woman has a bevy of info

43:34.985 --> 43:36.793
on her roommates.

43:36.795 --> 43:40.533
She knows where the spirits are located,

43:40.535 --> 43:45.535
and Irma has to go down a
metaphysical rabbit hole

43:45.645 --> 43:46.478
to find them.

43:49.695 --> 43:53.023
We switch genre two-thirds in.

43:53.025 --> 43:54.858
This will throw your readers off.

43:55.835 --> 43:57.720
Get a lot of them in a tizzy.

43:57.722 --> 44:02.118
And I promise, the
payoff will be worth it.

44:16.935 --> 44:18.725
Your handwriting...

44:20.005 --> 44:21.518
You mean your handwriting.

44:24.255 --> 44:25.608
Don't ask me exactly how.

44:27.445 --> 44:30.958
I just think about your assets,

44:31.905 --> 44:34.022
and this is how the words come out.

44:44.155 --> 44:45.368
Who's this guy?

44:50.171 --> 44:51.004
Great.

46:43.197 --> 46:44.114
God dammit.

46:49.644 --> 46:50.477
Hello?

46:51.928 --> 46:54.103
It's kindly neighbor, Eban.

46:54.105 --> 46:55.613
Gas savior.

46:55.615 --> 46:56.998
All-around swell dude.

47:00.465 --> 47:02.678
Hey, you're alive.

47:02.680 --> 47:06.238
I'm also glad to see that
you are still breathing.

47:07.095 --> 47:08.845
Everything good in the hood here?

47:10.544 --> 47:11.973
I mean, sure.

47:11.975 --> 47:13.493
Super convincing.

47:13.495 --> 47:15.093
That's me.

47:15.095 --> 47:16.533
No, everything's fine.

47:16.535 --> 47:18.493
Thanks for checking in.

47:18.495 --> 47:19.328
Okay, cool.

47:20.655 --> 47:21.933
You have dinner yet?

47:21.935 --> 47:22.768
No.

47:23.665 --> 47:24.715
And are you hungry?

47:26.885 --> 47:29.723
Well, as you can plainly
see, I brought food.

47:29.725 --> 47:32.275
Do you want me to cook you
a tasty-ass meal or not?

47:34.185 --> 47:35.423
That's a bit weird.

47:35.425 --> 47:36.475
You know that, right?

47:37.328 --> 47:39.243
And you know I have weapons.

47:39.245 --> 47:41.383
My dad got me a taser for Christmas.

47:41.385 --> 47:42.216
Hmm.

47:42.218 --> 47:43.593
Festive.

47:43.595 --> 47:46.333
And pepper spray, it's
right on the keychain.

47:46.335 --> 47:47.198
City life, huh?

47:53.685 --> 47:54.516
Okay.

47:54.518 --> 47:56.298
But promise not to murder me?

47:57.475 --> 47:58.308
Too easy.

48:05.155 --> 48:07.993
I just couldn't hack it,
the whole nine to five

48:07.995 --> 48:09.648
or six or seven thing.

48:10.575 --> 48:12.523
And I firmly believe now that marketing

48:12.525 --> 48:16.203
is just another term for
making people buy useless crap.

48:16.205 --> 48:18.833
It was killing me, my soul.

48:18.835 --> 48:21.347
So I left that world altogether.

48:21.349 --> 48:23.353
You had something lined up, or...

48:23.355 --> 48:26.788
Well, technically I
was fired, but you know.

48:28.105 --> 48:30.113
I figured if I downgraded significantly

48:30.115 --> 48:32.133
I could give the woodworking a real go.

48:32.135 --> 48:34.553
I left my studio apartment in Clifton.

48:34.555 --> 48:36.843
It's a bit more of a populated town.

48:36.845 --> 48:38.063
It's not that far from here.

48:38.065 --> 48:40.053
Do you know it?

48:40.055 --> 48:42.405
Anyway, then I moved here
to my family's cabin.

48:43.375 --> 48:45.139
So it's working out for you.

48:45.141 --> 48:48.133
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I'm living off my savings,

48:48.135 --> 48:49.128
but we'll see.

48:51.125 --> 48:52.413
How'd you get into woodworking?

48:52.415 --> 48:53.933
My father taught me.

48:53.935 --> 48:55.633
He's a real master.

48:55.635 --> 48:57.985
He's known as Eddie the
Green County Wood King.

48:59.025 --> 49:01.753
I just really love the idea of
making something from nature,

49:01.755 --> 49:02.588
you know?

49:05.255 --> 49:07.955
Wait, I thought you said
you come here every summer.

49:08.861 --> 49:09.693
I did.

49:09.695 --> 49:10.883
And I do.

49:10.885 --> 49:13.460
I'm just here on a bit more
of a permanent basis now.

49:13.462 --> 49:14.295
Mm-hmm.

49:15.575 --> 49:17.093
Look, it's not exactly the kind of thing

49:17.095 --> 49:18.848
you brag about to a pretty girl.

49:19.795 --> 49:21.889
I don't like compliments.

49:21.891 --> 49:24.848
It wasn't, it was just
a clinical observation.

49:26.235 --> 49:28.433
So you like your chicken
grilled and healthy

49:28.435 --> 49:30.628
or fried and crispy and delicious?

49:32.365 --> 49:33.198
Fry me.

49:40.350 --> 49:41.183
Oh my god.

49:42.985 --> 49:43.818
This is so good.

49:45.095 --> 49:46.695
All right, come on, your turn.

49:48.335 --> 49:49.628
Just so damn juicy.

49:51.015 --> 49:52.363
If you don't tell me about your books,

49:52.365 --> 49:53.853
I will throw the rest of this poultry

49:53.855 --> 49:55.218
out to the damn wolves.

49:56.545 --> 49:57.378
Wait.

49:58.275 --> 49:59.108
There's wolves?

50:01.535 --> 50:02.368
Maybe.

50:03.335 --> 50:04.238
Come on, Arabella.

50:05.496 --> 50:07.447
Okay, okay.

50:08.385 --> 50:10.403
My first book...

50:10.405 --> 50:12.508
God, I hate talking about this.

50:17.175 --> 50:19.883
It was just a personal account.

50:19.885 --> 50:21.653
A lightly fictionalized
version of the whole

50:21.655 --> 50:25.263
millennial experience on
what it's like after college,

50:25.265 --> 50:27.163
with all the contradictions.

50:27.165 --> 50:29.883
With that cushy net they have
worked so hard to cultivate,

50:29.885 --> 50:31.735
just to be ripped out from under you.

50:32.635 --> 50:34.878
My voice resonated with my peers.

50:35.725 --> 50:37.023
It's funny.

50:37.025 --> 50:38.313
I'm funny.

50:38.315 --> 50:40.184
I forgot to tell you.

50:40.186 --> 50:41.273
I'm glad you did.

50:41.275 --> 50:42.625
Now I know to laugh at you.

50:43.845 --> 50:45.445
So what's this latest one about?

50:50.165 --> 50:54.243
Well, it's more of a
straightforward narrative,

50:54.245 --> 50:57.713
like an old time mystery, about a girl

50:57.715 --> 50:59.753
whose roommates go missing.

50:59.755 --> 51:01.873
I like that, sounds pretty interesting.

51:01.875 --> 51:03.664
Yeah, I just have to figure out the...

51:07.834 --> 51:08.665
Jesus.

51:08.667 --> 51:09.553
God damn.

51:09.555 --> 51:10.973
My heart.

51:10.975 --> 51:12.713
This place is falling apart.

51:12.715 --> 51:14.873
Probably collapse on me
in the middle of the night

51:14.875 --> 51:17.763
and finish the job.

51:17.765 --> 51:20.033
Before the wolves even get the chance.

51:20.035 --> 51:22.085
Will you shut up about the damn wolves?

51:26.685 --> 51:28.068
So what were we saying?

51:29.505 --> 51:32.293
Really, I don't want to
talk about work right now.

51:32.295 --> 51:34.993
Will you just let me
enjoy this damn feast?

51:34.995 --> 51:35.862
Fair enough.

51:40.764 --> 51:43.633
This one is from what I was 12.

51:43.635 --> 51:45.143
Skateboarding accident.

51:45.145 --> 51:47.371
15 stitches and everything.

51:47.373 --> 51:49.433
Ouch, you dork.

51:49.435 --> 51:50.688
Shut up, I was good.

51:50.690 --> 51:51.523
Kind of.

51:52.825 --> 51:54.413
Okay.

51:54.415 --> 51:55.555
Believe it or not...

51:57.255 --> 51:59.733
This one is from sailing.

51:59.735 --> 52:00.978
Pretty boozy of you.

52:02.625 --> 52:03.663
Oh, this one is good.

52:03.665 --> 52:06.102
It's pretty faded, but still kinda gross.

52:07.208 --> 52:08.710
From a blackout night at college.

52:08.712 --> 52:10.928
I have no memory at all how I got this.

52:16.837 --> 52:18.513
What'd I miss?

52:18.515 --> 52:20.978
Sorry if that one was too gruesome.

52:22.365 --> 52:25.818
No, that one was lovely.

52:27.521 --> 52:28.578
Ah, merci, madame.

52:32.595 --> 52:33.428
Okay.

52:35.375 --> 52:36.925
Do you want to see a weird one?

52:40.945 --> 52:42.303
I love that movie.

52:42.305 --> 52:43.843
I can't believe you know Fellini.

52:43.845 --> 52:45.426
What, I don't seem cultured to you?

52:45.428 --> 52:47.173
No, it's just that,
you know, most people-

52:47.175 --> 52:50.400
- Are blithering, uncouth
idiots and I'm one of them.

52:50.402 --> 52:53.273
No, I was going to say that most people

52:53.275 --> 52:55.393
know "Dolce Vita," but "Cabiria"-

52:55.395 --> 52:57.508
- I'm messing with you, Arabella.

52:59.525 --> 53:02.023
I just love her character.

53:02.025 --> 53:03.723
Such a badass bitch.

53:03.725 --> 53:04.556
Yeah.

53:04.558 --> 53:07.123
With those like amazingly expressive eyes.

53:07.125 --> 53:08.425
Kind of reminds me of you.

53:09.352 --> 53:11.578
Now that is a compliment I will take.

53:14.615 --> 53:15.615
I'll check it out.

53:19.465 --> 53:20.618
Ah, damn.

53:22.535 --> 53:23.366
What?

53:23.368 --> 53:25.648
A bird, it must've flown into the...

53:29.554 --> 53:33.471
I'm just gonna use the
bathroom really quick.

53:50.443 --> 53:51.276
Shit!

53:52.326 --> 53:54.326
Did you do that outside?

53:55.279 --> 53:56.663
Get rid of him.

53:56.665 --> 53:57.496
Why?

53:57.498 --> 53:59.163
He is a distraction from our work.

53:59.165 --> 54:00.743
Oh, Jesus, can't I
have dinner with some-

54:00.745 --> 54:03.743
- You're getting drunk and wasting time.

54:03.745 --> 54:06.445
Well did you ever think
that maybe he was a suspect?

54:07.430 --> 54:09.643
I don't remember seeing him, so no.

54:09.645 --> 54:10.476
Really?

54:10.478 --> 54:12.392
You don't recognize your
own nextdoor neighbor?

54:17.215 --> 54:18.053
Fine.

54:18.055 --> 54:21.748
See what information you get from him.

54:33.908 --> 54:35.348
Everything okay?

54:36.835 --> 54:37.666
Yeah.

54:37.668 --> 54:39.648
I just have a weak stomach
for that kinda thing.

54:42.285 --> 54:44.653
So what were we talking about?

54:44.655 --> 54:46.473
Oh, the film.

54:46.475 --> 54:49.188
Right, yeah, I just
really liked the ending.

54:50.095 --> 54:51.383
Yeah.

54:51.385 --> 54:53.958
So tell me, why did
you really move up here?

54:55.185 --> 54:56.016
What do you mean?

54:56.018 --> 54:57.593
I told you.

54:57.595 --> 55:00.778
Okay, you quit or got
removed from the rat race.

55:02.065 --> 55:03.423
But why all the way up here?

55:03.425 --> 55:05.553
It's really so far away from society.

55:05.555 --> 55:06.803
It's free.

55:06.805 --> 55:08.863
I'm just figuring things out.

55:08.865 --> 55:09.983
Okay.

55:09.985 --> 55:13.098
And you said it's been in your
family for like, generations?

55:14.565 --> 55:15.983
Well, my grandfather bought it.

55:15.985 --> 55:16.983
Yeah.

55:16.985 --> 55:19.833
Like I said, my dad and
I would come up summers,

55:19.835 --> 55:21.063
my mom too sometimes.

55:21.065 --> 55:23.448
What's that like, genuinely fun?

55:25.688 --> 55:26.793
What?

55:26.795 --> 55:29.083
What are you like, trying
to get character research

55:29.085 --> 55:30.143
for your book or something?

55:30.145 --> 55:32.738
No, I'm just interested.

55:40.025 --> 55:40.923
It's getting pretty late.

55:40.925 --> 55:43.083
I should probably get going.

55:43.085 --> 55:44.293
Oh.

55:44.295 --> 55:45.633
Yeah.

55:45.635 --> 55:47.589
You know, wolves out there were.

55:47.591 --> 55:49.448
Will you shut up about the damn wolves?

55:50.925 --> 55:53.033
But let's hang out again soon.

55:53.035 --> 55:54.723
Yeah, for sure.

55:54.725 --> 55:56.763
Maybe you can cook for me next time.

55:56.765 --> 55:57.628
I do owe you.

55:58.587 --> 55:59.420
Okay.

56:06.795 --> 56:08.023
Right, see you around.

56:08.025 --> 56:09.448
Yeah. Thanks again.

56:45.405 --> 56:47.668
Real smooth, Colombo.

56:50.645 --> 56:51.895
That's at least better.

56:53.075 --> 56:54.925
I'm kinda getting the hang of this.

56:55.775 --> 56:57.216
I'm gonna go back to the computer.

56:57.218 --> 56:58.998
You just keep writing.

57:15.042 --> 57:16.618
Hey, how's it going?

57:18.495 --> 57:20.023
Great.

57:20.025 --> 57:22.498
You want to trade for a minute?

57:36.189 --> 57:37.439
This is good.

57:43.455 --> 57:45.349
This is even better.

58:38.704 --> 58:39.537
Vivian!

58:42.658 --> 58:45.658
Oh my god, I'm so sorry, Arabella.

58:47.128 --> 58:47.961
I can't.

58:50.115 --> 58:51.245
I have to leave.

58:51.247 --> 58:52.080
Please.

58:54.198 --> 58:56.148
Please, don't leave me.

58:58.865 --> 59:01.163
This can't happen again.

59:01.165 --> 59:02.993
- I'm sorry.
- Ever.

59:02.995 --> 59:03.828
I swear.

59:05.086 --> 59:07.253
I won't let it, I promise.

59:48.034 --> 59:48.960
Hey.

59:48.962 --> 59:52.143
Hey, I wasn't gonna come so soon,

59:52.145 --> 59:53.973
but when I was leaving last night,

59:53.975 --> 59:56.593
I noticed that your tire is still flat.

59:56.595 --> 59:58.378
Did you not call for anyone?

59:58.380 --> 59:59.213
Oh, I...

01:00:00.328 --> 01:00:02.393
That completely slipped my mind.

01:00:02.395 --> 01:00:04.453
You were borderline
desperate to get out of here

01:00:04.455 --> 01:00:05.533
two days ago.

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:07.154
That's true.

01:00:07.156 --> 01:00:08.933
Okay, crazy.

01:00:08.935 --> 01:00:10.813
Well, the ground feels a little firmer.

01:00:10.815 --> 01:00:12.343
I could give it another shot.

01:00:12.345 --> 01:00:14.523
Maybe save you the cost of the tow.

01:00:14.525 --> 01:00:16.225
That would be sincerely amazing.

01:00:33.135 --> 01:00:34.633
Thank you.

01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:36.003
That's it?

01:00:36.005 --> 01:00:38.655
Kinda feel like you did
it just to prove you could.

01:00:39.565 --> 01:00:40.713
All right, I gotta go.

01:00:40.715 --> 01:00:41.852
Wait.

01:00:46.065 --> 01:00:46.898
Thank you.

01:00:48.095 --> 01:00:48.928
Anytime.

01:00:50.955 --> 01:00:52.653
Like I said, you ever want to stop by,

01:00:52.655 --> 01:00:54.823
I'm just five minutes that way.

01:00:54.825 --> 01:00:55.658
Yeah.

01:00:56.755 --> 01:00:57.588
Bye.

01:01:22.475 --> 01:01:25.378
Vivian, are you here?

01:01:26.405 --> 01:01:27.505
I'm coming.

01:01:29.795 --> 01:01:32.983
Wait, how far from the cabin can you go?

01:01:32.985 --> 01:01:34.938
Just around the periphery of it.

01:01:36.205 --> 01:01:37.068
Good to know.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:40.953
Before we start today-

01:01:40.955 --> 01:01:42.613
- Yes.

01:01:42.615 --> 01:01:43.638
Last night.

01:01:48.485 --> 01:01:52.303
I think the pain's still inside me,

01:01:52.305 --> 01:01:56.203
and manifests in ways that
are rather unpleasant,

01:01:56.205 --> 01:01:59.018
but I am really learning
how to control it.

01:02:00.485 --> 01:02:02.163
Okay, that's all I-

01:02:02.165 --> 01:02:04.898
- Thank you, Arabella, from
the bottom of my heart.

01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:09.383
Okay.

01:02:09.385 --> 01:02:13.253
So anyways, as you saw,
these are the main contenders

01:02:13.255 --> 01:02:14.888
for America's next top murderer.

01:02:15.785 --> 01:02:17.318
That's from a reality TV show?

01:02:21.385 --> 01:02:22.513
Anyways.

01:02:22.515 --> 01:02:24.488
What do you know about this Gerard guy?

01:02:25.915 --> 01:02:28.418
Sounds so familiar.

01:02:29.785 --> 01:02:31.288
I can't see him.

01:02:32.465 --> 01:02:33.668
Not in real life.

01:02:34.645 --> 01:02:35.673
All right.

01:02:35.675 --> 01:02:36.903
Do you know his real name?

01:02:36.905 --> 01:02:38.383
I don't know.

01:02:38.385 --> 01:02:39.488
He was a fan.

01:02:40.335 --> 01:02:42.083
Maybe of my books?

01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:44.013
He was definitely that.

01:02:44.015 --> 01:02:46.973
I get the vibe he was somewhat
obsessed with your writing.

01:02:46.975 --> 01:02:48.093
With you.

01:02:48.095 --> 01:02:51.843
Like, he copies your same
style of tweets or whatever?

01:02:51.845 --> 01:02:53.553
Wait.

01:02:53.555 --> 01:02:54.388
Yes!

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.533
This is sounding very-

01:02:57.535 --> 01:02:59.283
- Do you think he was maybe obsessed

01:02:59.285 --> 01:03:01.668
with like becoming you in a way?

01:03:05.245 --> 01:03:06.395
I'm gonna keep digging.

01:03:55.608 --> 01:03:56.775
What the fuck?

01:04:17.155 --> 01:04:18.234
Hey stranger.

01:04:18.236 --> 01:04:19.283
Oh.

01:04:19.285 --> 01:04:21.343
Hey, how are you?

01:04:21.345 --> 01:04:22.993
Not too shabby.

01:04:22.995 --> 01:04:24.963
I realized I hadn't been
around in a while to annoy you,

01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:26.553
so I figured I'd say...

01:04:26.555 --> 01:04:28.873
So that's your style, huh?

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:31.093
Kiss a girl, have her
waiting around for you,

01:04:31.095 --> 01:04:33.213
trying to get them to pine over you?

01:04:33.215 --> 01:04:35.433
Hey, you kissed me.

01:04:35.435 --> 01:04:36.853
You're such a dick!

01:04:36.855 --> 01:04:38.433
I'm just kidding.

01:04:38.435 --> 01:04:39.985
I've actually been really busy.

01:04:40.975 --> 01:04:44.615
Plus I wasn't sure exactly
how to approach the...

01:04:48.595 --> 01:04:51.493
Look. I said you could come
visit me, you never did.

01:04:51.495 --> 01:04:52.733
I didn't want to come off as like,

01:04:52.735 --> 01:04:55.193
I don't know, aggressive or something.

01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:56.363
Whatever, it's fine.

01:04:56.365 --> 01:04:57.315
I've been busy too.

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:01.253
So you're almost done with it?

01:05:01.255 --> 01:05:02.103
Yeah.

01:05:02.105 --> 01:05:03.663
I actually have to get back to it,

01:05:03.665 --> 01:05:06.083
but we should have dinner
again sometime soon.

01:05:06.085 --> 01:05:07.183
Absolutely.

01:05:07.185 --> 01:05:09.783
I'll totally let you cook for me.

01:05:09.785 --> 01:05:12.703
You're supposed to
cook for me this time.

01:05:12.705 --> 01:05:13.805
It's fine, I'll do it.

01:05:14.765 --> 01:05:15.953
All right.

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:16.955
- See ya.
- See ya.

01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:30.193
No, that's actually very helpful.

01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:32.665
Do you happen to have a
forwarding address or...

01:05:34.475 --> 01:05:35.308
Great.

01:05:39.705 --> 01:05:41.313
I'm getting really close.

01:05:41.315 --> 01:05:43.473
Our buddy, Gerard, pretty much fell off

01:05:43.475 --> 01:05:45.043
the face of the Earth after your death.

01:05:45.045 --> 01:05:46.588
But I got him.

01:05:47.505 --> 01:05:49.623
You mean you located him?

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:50.456
Mm-hmm.

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:52.283
Apparently he was
heading out, which hello,

01:05:52.285 --> 01:05:54.363
is suspect as all shit to begin with.

01:05:54.365 --> 01:05:55.355
But then...

01:05:59.175 --> 01:06:00.006
Jesus.

01:06:00.008 --> 01:06:01.463
Yeah, a goddamn palindrome.

01:06:01.465 --> 01:06:03.223
Can you be any more cliche?

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:04.943
It's been active for the last six months.

01:06:04.945 --> 01:06:07.393
Well, he hasn't posted
anything the last few weeks,

01:06:07.395 --> 01:06:09.323
but it's him, I know it.

01:06:09.325 --> 01:06:10.833
And guess what?

01:06:10.835 --> 01:06:14.703
The geo tag on his last
tweet, six miles from here.

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:17.613
And this page has the idiot's full name.

01:06:17.615 --> 01:06:18.518
Gerard Phillip.

01:06:19.615 --> 01:06:20.931
You got him.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:21.766
And you?

01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:25.263
Home stretch.

01:06:25.265 --> 01:06:28.223
- Really, and it's-
- It's good, girl.

01:06:28.225 --> 01:06:29.428
It's goddamn good.

01:06:30.605 --> 01:06:34.078
Less than 50 pages or so to finish.

01:06:34.975 --> 01:06:36.278
To solve the mystery.

01:07:18.165 --> 01:07:18.996
Yes.

01:07:18.998 --> 01:07:20.253
I need to get him this
check and I don't have

01:07:20.255 --> 01:07:21.455
the new address on file.

01:07:22.435 --> 01:07:24.253
If you could give me
his actual phone number,

01:07:24.255 --> 01:07:25.723
that would be the best,
so I know it's going

01:07:25.725 --> 01:07:26.678
to the right place.

01:07:28.805 --> 01:07:29.638
Yes.

01:07:30.565 --> 01:07:31.398
Yes I can.

01:07:32.825 --> 01:07:33.658
Take your time.

01:08:06.766 --> 01:08:08.758
Oh, hey there, girl.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:11.098
There you are.

01:08:12.193 --> 01:08:13.293
What are you doing here?

01:08:13.295 --> 01:08:15.353
I'm just being neighborly.

01:08:15.355 --> 01:08:18.283
Now I started to think I
wouldn't see you again.

01:08:18.285 --> 01:08:19.818
Then I spotted your vehicle.

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:25.133
Okay, well, me and my boyfriend
are really busy right now,

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:26.108
so I'll see you-

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:27.693
- Oh, come on.

01:08:27.694 --> 01:08:29.113
We're friends here.

01:08:29.115 --> 01:08:30.688
No need to tell fibs.

01:08:31.865 --> 01:08:33.115
You're the only one here.

01:08:34.165 --> 01:08:35.803
That's pretty fucking obvious, no?

01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:36.983
I'll call the police right now

01:08:36.984 --> 01:08:37.975
if you don't get the fuck off my property!

01:08:37.978 --> 01:08:40.640
Oh, whoa, whoa!

01:08:40.642 --> 01:08:42.957
Look, listen, I'm the good guy here.

01:08:44.404 --> 01:08:45.854
Just making sure you're okay.

01:08:46.794 --> 01:08:48.127
We're all alone.

01:08:49.122 --> 01:08:49.955
In the middle...

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:54.149
What the fuck?!

01:08:56.658 --> 01:08:57.651
Creep.

01:08:57.653 --> 01:08:59.343
Jesus Christ.

01:08:59.345 --> 01:09:00.178
I can't.

01:09:01.165 --> 01:09:03.633
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:09:03.635 --> 01:09:04.468
Thank you.

01:09:06.255 --> 01:09:07.694
I have to get out of here.

01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:09.867
Me too.

01:09:35.734 --> 01:09:37.473
Hi, my name is Marcy Adams.

01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:38.622
I'm calling for Gerard Phillip.

01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:39.457
Is this he?

01:09:42.622 --> 01:09:43.455
He what?

01:09:46.545 --> 01:09:49.377
I'm really sorry to hear that.

01:09:51.765 --> 01:09:53.368
Can you tell me when this happened?

01:10:00.455 --> 01:10:01.905
Can I ask you one more thing?

01:10:03.405 --> 01:10:06.088
Do you know if he was living
in Clifton during 2018?

01:10:09.555 --> 01:10:10.388
What?

01:10:12.553 --> 01:10:13.386
Oh.

01:10:16.855 --> 01:10:18.438
Sorry to disturb.

01:11:05.401 --> 01:11:06.328
He didn't do it.

01:11:07.945 --> 01:11:08.778
What?

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.033
Gerard.

01:11:16.035 --> 01:11:17.388
He couldn't have done it.

01:11:21.285 --> 01:11:22.498
What do you mean?

01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:32.195
He was in jail for stalking,

01:11:32.295 --> 01:11:37.295
either you or someone
else, but he wasn't here.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:30.049
Vivian?

01:12:48.223 --> 01:12:49.056
Vivian.

01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:52.168
Please.

01:12:53.985 --> 01:12:54.952
I need you.

01:12:58.275 --> 01:12:59.723
This isn't over.

01:12:59.725 --> 01:13:02.398
I will find out what happened to you.

01:13:06.412 --> 01:13:07.245
Please.

01:14:15.813 --> 01:14:16.646
Vivian.

01:14:18.477 --> 01:14:19.310
Please.

01:14:20.745 --> 01:14:21.853
I know you can hear me.

01:14:21.855 --> 01:14:23.352
I am begging you.

01:14:25.434 --> 01:14:26.267
Help me.

01:16:12.289 --> 01:16:14.653
He, what are you doing?

01:16:14.655 --> 01:16:16.618
Just trying to protect myself.

01:16:19.201 --> 01:16:23.012
Are you all right?

01:16:23.014 --> 01:16:24.097
Not really.

01:16:25.545 --> 01:16:27.333
Arabella, what happened?

01:16:27.335 --> 01:16:28.528
I heard you screaming.

01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:39.653
So you think I'm crazy, right?

01:16:39.655 --> 01:16:40.867
No.

01:16:40.869 --> 01:16:41.702
I don't.

01:16:42.852 --> 01:16:43.913
I just don't know what to-

01:16:43.915 --> 01:16:45.858
- Got it, you think I'm a lunatic.

01:16:46.832 --> 01:16:47.665
Don't.

01:16:48.635 --> 01:16:50.368
It's just a lot to take in.

01:17:10.405 --> 01:17:11.238
What?

01:17:12.242 --> 01:17:13.692
You really didn't know her?

01:17:14.775 --> 01:17:17.012
No, I honestly never met her.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.913
And you didn't hear?

01:17:26.805 --> 01:17:28.413
Of course I heard about that.

01:17:28.415 --> 01:17:29.772
- Everybody did.
- Right.

01:17:34.025 --> 01:17:35.413
Hot.

01:17:35.415 --> 01:17:37.410
It's made with boiling water.

01:17:37.412 --> 01:17:38.288
It happens.

01:17:39.495 --> 01:17:40.448
So I've heard.

01:17:42.345 --> 01:17:43.395
You can blow on it.

01:17:50.575 --> 01:17:55.020
So do you believe me or what?

01:17:55.022 --> 01:17:57.883
I do, I do.

01:17:57.885 --> 01:17:59.145
It's just a lot...

01:18:02.305 --> 01:18:03.138
You mentioned.

01:18:06.295 --> 01:18:07.473
All right.

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:09.173
Let's look at what you can do now.

01:18:09.175 --> 01:18:10.006
Okay.

01:18:10.008 --> 01:18:12.738
You said the book is
almost finished, right?

01:18:13.765 --> 01:18:16.708
And that's all you really
need out of this situation?

01:18:18.685 --> 01:18:19.953
Yeah.

01:18:19.955 --> 01:18:21.063
So just finish it.

01:18:21.065 --> 01:18:22.453
You've got one more day left.

01:18:22.455 --> 01:18:25.423
Yeah, but I don't know how.

01:18:25.425 --> 01:18:28.223
The new plot she devised,
it's so intricate.

01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:31.293
There are all these new
characters and setups.

01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:34.383
Only she knows how it's
really supposed to end.

01:18:34.385 --> 01:18:35.625
As it is now...

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:38.348
It's literary gibberish.

01:18:39.785 --> 01:18:40.618
- Damn.
- Yep.

01:18:42.745 --> 01:18:45.378
Come on, you're a good
writer, you can do this.

01:18:46.415 --> 01:18:49.283
Yeah, but you don't understand.

01:18:49.285 --> 01:18:53.218
Because it's from someone
else's mind, I can't grasp it.

01:18:55.575 --> 01:18:56.408
I just can't.

01:18:58.085 --> 01:19:00.833
Okay, well what about this?

01:19:00.835 --> 01:19:03.663
Why don't you just send it in
as is to meet the deadline,

01:19:03.665 --> 01:19:05.453
and then that'll buy
you some time so you can

01:19:05.455 --> 01:19:08.213
come up with your own
ending in the meantime.

01:19:08.215 --> 01:19:10.263
If I don't send them
the completed draft,

01:19:10.265 --> 01:19:12.403
they'll make me give
back the full advance.

01:19:12.405 --> 01:19:14.118
Okay, that sucks, but so?

01:19:15.225 --> 01:19:16.503
I've spent it all.

01:19:16.505 --> 01:19:19.873
I have nothing left, and
that means they'll sue me.

01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:22.133
That sounds a bit dramatic, no?

01:19:22.135 --> 01:19:23.723
That's how it works.

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.915
They've all given me a lot of rope...

01:19:27.615 --> 01:19:28.688
To hang myself with.

01:19:29.855 --> 01:19:30.905
Jesus, you're grim.

01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:37.363
Okay, I have an idea.

01:19:37.365 --> 01:19:39.453
Why don't you just take some time,

01:19:39.455 --> 01:19:42.083
try to clear your head,
and maybe something

01:19:42.085 --> 01:19:43.523
will come to you.

01:19:43.525 --> 01:19:44.653
Doubtful.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.353
I'm gonna go back to my
place and give you some space.

01:19:47.355 --> 01:19:50.243
But I shall return with
the necessary ingredients

01:19:50.245 --> 01:19:54.283
to make you a glorious
final sendoff feast.

01:19:54.285 --> 01:19:56.283
Whatever, Spice Bay.

01:19:56.285 --> 01:19:57.463
Ouch.

01:19:57.465 --> 01:19:59.173
Really dated reference.

01:19:59.175 --> 01:20:00.323
My mind is mush.

01:20:00.325 --> 01:20:01.483
I told you.

01:20:01.485 --> 01:20:03.328
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.690
I'll see you tonight.

01:21:19.102 --> 01:21:19.935
Come in.

01:21:27.765 --> 01:21:29.883
If you make any sudden movements,

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.023
I will pepper spray the shit out of you

01:21:32.025 --> 01:21:33.863
and tase you to the brink of death.

01:21:33.865 --> 01:21:35.932
If you lie to me again, I'll do the same.

01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:36.851
Understand?

01:21:46.515 --> 01:21:47.346
You knew her.

01:21:47.348 --> 01:21:48.278
Why did you lie to me?

01:21:49.974 --> 01:21:53.493
I swear on my life I never met her.

01:21:53.495 --> 01:21:54.995
Then why did you make these?

01:21:56.255 --> 01:21:57.218
I didn't.

01:21:58.355 --> 01:22:01.508
Eban, I'm giving you one more
chance to tell me the truth.

01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:19.863
My father did.

01:22:19.865 --> 01:22:20.698
For her.

01:22:22.415 --> 01:22:24.033
What was his name?

01:22:24.035 --> 01:22:25.053
It's Edward.

01:22:25.055 --> 01:22:25.888
Eddie.

01:22:29.485 --> 01:22:30.493
What are you talking about?

01:22:30.495 --> 01:22:31.328
Why?

01:22:34.245 --> 01:22:35.695
They were having an affair.

01:22:36.635 --> 01:22:39.178
They were apparently in love.

01:22:41.085 --> 01:22:42.043
How do you know this?

01:22:42.045 --> 01:22:43.178
My mother found out.

01:22:44.645 --> 01:22:46.613
One weekend when we were all up here,

01:22:46.615 --> 01:22:49.323
like two and a half
years ago, I heard them

01:22:49.325 --> 01:22:50.248
fighting about it.

01:22:51.415 --> 01:22:52.503
And he killed her to shut her up.

01:22:52.505 --> 01:22:53.336
No.

01:22:53.338 --> 01:22:54.169
And you've been covering for him.

01:22:54.171 --> 01:22:55.618
- No.
- Then what!

01:22:57.655 --> 01:22:59.013
No, Arabella.

01:22:59.015 --> 01:23:01.233
She really did kill herself.

01:23:01.235 --> 01:23:02.673
I dunno if you knew this about her,

01:23:02.675 --> 01:23:06.218
but she had some severe
problems with depression,

01:23:07.325 --> 01:23:11.623
and she became kind of
obsessed with my father.

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:13.223
She was threatening to kill herself

01:23:13.225 --> 01:23:14.675
if he didn't leave my mother.

01:23:16.585 --> 01:23:17.418
Look.

01:23:18.435 --> 01:23:20.693
The night it finally happened,

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:23.573
I was up here with my dad, and I heard her

01:23:23.575 --> 01:23:26.483
come in to the cabin,
Vivian, and I heard them

01:23:26.485 --> 01:23:29.673
downstairs fighting, and
then she left screaming

01:23:29.675 --> 01:23:32.208
that she was gonna get
vengeance or something.

01:23:34.584 --> 01:23:35.523
But that doesn't-

01:23:35.525 --> 01:23:38.823
- My father was with me
the rest of the night.

01:23:38.825 --> 01:23:41.643
She must've come back
here, drank whatever poison

01:23:41.645 --> 01:23:43.653
she wanted to implicate him with,

01:23:43.655 --> 01:23:46.783
and given herself the cuts like you said,

01:23:46.785 --> 01:23:49.376
then finish the job with the Drano.

01:23:49.378 --> 01:23:53.418
I guess the police always knew
it was just that, a suicide.

01:23:55.471 --> 01:23:56.302
It's true.

01:23:56.304 --> 01:23:57.818
Shit!

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:00.993
It's true.

01:24:02.268 --> 01:24:06.903
I swear to you, Arabella, the
memory of all that was erased.

01:24:06.905 --> 01:24:09.118
But now I can see it all.

01:24:10.965 --> 01:24:12.128
I feel different now.

01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:26.323
I feel free now.

01:24:27.605 --> 01:24:28.638
I feel lighter.

01:24:31.165 --> 01:24:33.328
I also feel darker.

01:24:39.135 --> 01:24:42.148
Your father, your blood.

01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:49.148
And you, you would dare to leave me here?

01:25:15.906 --> 01:25:17.163
Eban!

01:25:17.165 --> 01:25:17.998
Go.

01:26:10.993 --> 01:26:11.826
What?

01:26:12.848 --> 01:26:15.927
I know how I'm gonna end my story.

01:26:15.929 --> 01:26:17.512
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:21.785 --> 01:26:24.453
Should we get a motel?

01:26:24.455 --> 01:26:26.093
Yeah, good idea.

01:26:26.095 --> 01:26:29.555
Let's just put a couple more
miles in between us and...

01:27:08.395 --> 01:27:11.032
So what's this ending going to be?

01:27:14.945 --> 01:27:16.733
I guess I can tell you, but don't post

01:27:16.735 --> 01:27:17.985
any spoilers or anything.

01:27:19.485 --> 01:27:20.335
Cross my heart.

01:27:21.525 --> 01:27:22.356
Okay.

01:27:22.358 --> 01:27:25.343
So the main character Irma
is basically being gaslit

01:27:25.345 --> 01:27:26.883
by everyone around her.

01:27:26.885 --> 01:27:28.493
She's not crazy.

01:27:28.495 --> 01:27:30.003
Her roommates that went missing

01:27:30.005 --> 01:27:32.133
are just playing some sick game on her.

01:27:32.135 --> 01:27:33.763
They do it to all the new
roommates that move in there

01:27:33.765 --> 01:27:35.428
to try to make them feel insane.

01:27:36.725 --> 01:27:39.333
It's a metaphor, for trying so desperately

01:27:39.335 --> 01:27:42.123
to fit into society that's so self-hating,

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:43.488
it turns its malice on you.

01:27:47.655 --> 01:27:49.273
That's something.

01:27:49.275 --> 01:27:52.063
Well, it's gonna be a lot
better than I just said,

01:27:52.065 --> 01:27:53.358
but you know.

01:27:56.505 --> 01:27:59.838
I'd probably go in
a different direction.

01:28:02.786 --> 01:28:03.617
What?

01:28:11.225 --> 01:28:14.548
You thought you were just
going to leave me there?

01:28:16.266 --> 01:28:17.099
Huh?

01:28:18.095 --> 01:28:22.493
I told you, Arabella,
depending on my mood,

01:28:22.495 --> 01:28:24.978
I can appear in very different forms.

01:28:33.485 --> 01:28:36.228
Thank you, Arabella, for
freeing me of the prison.

01:28:38.567 --> 01:28:39.400
What?

01:28:41.285 --> 01:28:46.203
As I said, I was chained to that place.

01:28:46.205 --> 01:28:51.205
Now that you solved my
mystery, I'm free to leave.

01:28:52.205 --> 01:28:55.213
To transcend to the next plane.

01:28:55.215 --> 01:28:56.065
Or...

01:28:58.705 --> 01:28:59.538
Or what?

01:29:04.134 --> 01:29:04.967
Oh.

01:29:05.935 --> 01:29:08.158
Or stay right here, you silly goose.

01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:59.540
Hey Bruce, have I got an ending for you.

01:30:30.262 --> 01:30:34.325
