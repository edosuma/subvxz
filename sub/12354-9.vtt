WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:04.306
I'm out. I'm gonna
start my own shop.

00:04.340 --> 00:05.675
Is that Marty on the line?

00:05.709 --> 00:07.444
Remind him that I own his ass.

00:07.478 --> 00:09.312
I own your ass, motherfucker!

00:09.347 --> 00:10.880
(Grunting)

00:13.048 --> 00:14.680
I got into an altercation
with the cops.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.849
I'm moving forward.
I'm happy.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.019
I wish you could
move forward, too.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.588
Are you sure that you're okay
with him living with Monica?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.356
I mean, she fine,
but cuckoo crazy.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.991
Oh, God.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.225
You put together six months
of sobriety,

00:27.260 --> 00:28.559
and I'll vanish.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.826
<i>Roscoe:
Dad, I've been thinking.</i>

00:29.860 --> 00:30.994
I'd like to move back home.

00:31.028 --> 00:32.561
You gonna move back in with me?

00:32.595 --> 00:34.729
Clyde hit on you?

00:34.764 --> 00:36.298
If anything, I would've thought
there was something

00:36.332 --> 00:37.733
going on between you and Marty.

00:37.767 --> 00:39.868
So, what does this mean? It
means, as far as I'm concerned,

00:39.903 --> 00:41.170
my marriage is over.

01:01.824 --> 01:05.006
<i>Tamara:
Mmm, good morning.</i>

01:05.041 --> 01:08.752
I see you, um, broke out
some new moves in there.

01:08.786 --> 01:11.669
<i>Very nice. You've been
married ten years, girl.</i>

01:11.703 --> 01:13.630
Everything's a new move to you.

01:13.665 --> 01:15.555
You shouldn't have been
avoiding me in "b" school.

01:15.590 --> 01:18.143
Oh, I wasn't-- there was
actually a time when I was...

01:18.177 --> 01:19.806
I was gonna give you some.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.299
<i>When?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</i>

01:21.333 --> 01:24.386
<i>Before you started
fucking the antichrist. No.</i>

01:24.421 --> 01:25.979
You were way
into Kevin back then.

01:26.014 --> 01:27.870
You were all in love and shit.

01:27.905 --> 01:29.828
(Tamara laughs)

01:29.862 --> 01:31.817
<i>Marty:
Yeah. Hey, listen.</i>

01:31.851 --> 01:34.703
Um, I want you to meet Roscoe.

01:37.992 --> 01:40.048
He's-he's moving
back in today.

01:40.083 --> 01:43.009
And I'm always
so... I'm not...

01:43.038 --> 01:44.668
I'm trying to be a little
more... I understand.

01:44.702 --> 01:46.494
You know what I mean?
I just think I need

01:46.528 --> 01:48.353
a little bit of time
to think about that.

01:48.387 --> 01:50.647
I'm not sure I'm ready
for you to meet my kids.

01:50.681 --> 01:51.809
Kevin's in town.

01:51.844 --> 01:52.805
Oh.
That could....

01:52.839 --> 01:53.867
That could be a mess, I mean...

01:53.902 --> 01:54.897
Oh, no, I get it.

01:58.692 --> 02:00.486
You sure?
Yeah, I get it.

02:02.146 --> 02:04.547
I'm gonna go find my panties.

02:08.317 --> 02:09.949
(Whispering):
I want you to meet Roscoe.

02:09.982 --> 02:13.749
Shut the fuck up.

02:17.553 --> 02:18.520
Barry, hey.

02:18.554 --> 02:19.788
Yeah, how's it going?

02:19.822 --> 02:22.123
Look, thanks for getting back
to me on a Sunday.

02:22.158 --> 02:26.461
Yeah, uh, the message
was cryptic, I know.

02:26.495 --> 02:27.728
Here's the thing, man.

02:27.763 --> 02:29.530
I am going out on my own.

02:29.564 --> 02:31.432
Yes.

02:31.466 --> 02:34.367
Yeah, I know. I-I want you
to move all my assets.

02:34.401 --> 02:36.369
I know it's a big investment.
That's...

02:36.403 --> 02:38.370
(Wind chimes tinkling,
dog barking)

02:38.404 --> 02:40.405
L-Larry, hold on. Hold on.

02:42.038 --> 02:44.035
I got to call you back, man.

02:45.234 --> 02:47.228
Fuck.

02:47.262 --> 02:49.257
(Juicer whirring)

02:54.328 --> 02:56.829
You're really getting
the hang of this.

02:58.499 --> 03:00.466
Do not patronize me.

03:00.501 --> 03:02.468
I'm not.

03:02.502 --> 03:04.970
I mean it.

03:05.004 --> 03:06.772
You've been really great
with Roscoe.

03:06.806 --> 03:10.074
I mean, it's great.
It's surprising. Who knew?

03:10.108 --> 03:12.943
I know.

03:12.977 --> 03:14.411
Keep it up, mo, okay?

03:14.445 --> 03:16.146
He really needs this.

03:16.180 --> 03:18.147
The magnanimous winner.

03:18.182 --> 03:20.149
That's what this is, right?

03:20.183 --> 03:23.519
Let's not forget that
he was here because

03:23.553 --> 03:25.487
<i>you fucked up.</i>

03:25.522 --> 03:27.289
He came running to me.

03:27.323 --> 03:29.991
(Sighs) Monica, let's not
kid ourselves, all right?

03:30.025 --> 03:31.492
We always knew
this was just a detour.

03:31.527 --> 03:34.427
And I can't compete with
a police beat-down to guilt him

03:34.462 --> 03:36.495
into staying, can I?

03:36.529 --> 03:39.030
<i>Roscoe feels like
he has to move back.</i>

03:39.064 --> 03:40.832
This is pity, Marty.

03:42.901 --> 03:45.469
Flash the applause sign.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.675
(Indistinct chatter in distance)

03:51.710 --> 03:54.311
What do you think you have?

03:54.345 --> 03:56.680
I don't know.
It's proof.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.715
This is just... (Scoffs)

03:58.750 --> 04:00.184
It's theater, Monica.

04:00.218 --> 04:01.518
It's fake.

04:01.553 --> 04:03.387
Ah.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.390
(Laughing):
That's...

04:06.424 --> 04:07.391
That's beautiful.

04:07.425 --> 04:09.058
You want to fuck my shit up?

04:09.093 --> 04:10.960
I will fuck yours up, too.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.034
Come on, Roscoe.
Let's go, buddy.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.202
Roscoe: I'm coming. Hey, baby.

04:19.237 --> 04:20.870
I made your favorite.

04:23.207 --> 04:25.173
Here you go.
Thank you.

04:25.207 --> 04:27.207
Oh, my God,
you are getting so good

04:27.241 --> 04:28.508
at the eyeliner.

04:28.542 --> 04:30.343
It's all in the wrist.

04:30.377 --> 04:31.544
Monica:
When your dad

04:31.579 --> 04:34.114
messes up again,
you can come back here, okay?

04:34.148 --> 04:35.648
Marty:
Really?

04:35.683 --> 04:37.383
Seriously, Monica,
you want to do this right now?

04:37.418 --> 04:38.718
Guys...
It's fine, Tessa.

04:38.753 --> 04:39.919
Same old shit.

04:39.953 --> 04:42.053
It's not scarring at all.

04:42.086 --> 04:44.588
(Sighing):
Okay.

04:46.091 --> 04:47.725
I love you, mom.

04:47.759 --> 04:49.627
I love you, too.

04:49.661 --> 04:51.230
(Laughs)

04:53.871 --> 04:56.348
Marty: Come on,
let's go, buddy.

04:59.561 --> 05:01.533
(Laughs)

05:06.952 --> 05:08.460
(Wind chimes tinkling)

05:08.495 --> 05:10.467
You okay, babe?

05:10.501 --> 05:12.472
Fuck.

05:12.506 --> 05:14.478
(Engine revving)

05:18.426 --> 05:21.834
(Car driving away)

05:21.869 --> 05:23.004
Marty:
...Hurt so much.

05:23.038 --> 05:24.174
Tamara:
Ooh. You didn't?

05:24.213 --> 05:25.650
Marty (Chuckling): No.
Tamara: Well, see...

05:25.684 --> 05:27.154
Fire in the hole.
Carlson's here.

05:27.188 --> 05:29.095
Oh, yeah, I know that.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.037
He's been blowing up
my e-mail all weekend.

05:31.071 --> 05:33.078
Yeah, at 3:00
in the goddamn morning.

05:33.113 --> 05:35.657
Can you please tell me again
why we're even putting up

05:35.691 --> 05:37.263
with this add
asperger-hole?

05:37.298 --> 05:39.637
This has... Is a Facebook deal of Vegas.

05:39.671 --> 05:42.581
You've got to put your name
and stank on this, Marty.

05:42.615 --> 05:43.918
Come on.
Uh...

05:46.094 --> 05:47.800
Is that a marmoset?

05:47.834 --> 05:49.204
(Chittering, door opening) Doug: Uh...

05:49.238 --> 05:53.390
Marty, meet ferret Marty.

05:53.424 --> 05:54.792
He-he's...

05:54.827 --> 05:56.397
A cute little guy, huh?

05:56.431 --> 05:57.934
Carlson:
So...

05:57.968 --> 05:59.306
(Clears throat)

05:59.340 --> 06:01.748
Who approved this, uh,

06:01.783 --> 06:03.084
phonics for business school shit

06:03.118 --> 06:04.819
you call an offer?

06:04.853 --> 06:06.154
The international language
is whack.

06:06.188 --> 06:08.424
You approved it, Mr. Carlson.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.160
During our six-hour
conference call last week, sir.

06:10.194 --> 06:11.930
Marty, Marty... go potty.

06:11.965 --> 06:13.466
You know what? I'm getting
a little sick and tired...

06:13.500 --> 06:15.201
Watch this.
(Chittering)

06:15.235 --> 06:16.669
Go ahead. Go, go, go. (Gasps) Oh.

06:16.703 --> 06:18.504
Jeannie:
Oh, this Marty

06:18.538 --> 06:19.505
does tricks.

06:19.539 --> 06:20.506
(Laughing)

06:20.540 --> 06:22.341
Good boy, Marty.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.342
Oh.
(Gasps)

06:23.376 --> 06:24.644
Oh.

06:24.678 --> 06:25.778
Good boy.

06:25.812 --> 06:27.380
Oh, Marty knows shit
when he smells it.

06:27.414 --> 06:28.715
Come here, Marty.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.818
Come on, Marty.
Good boy, Marty.

06:31.852 --> 06:33.754
Good boy.
(Chittering)

06:33.788 --> 06:36.457
Look, I want that shit
structured like a deal

06:36.491 --> 06:37.825
I did a few months ago,

06:37.859 --> 06:39.360
so call my office,
get the particulars

06:39.394 --> 06:40.829
on my Dubai deal.

06:40.863 --> 06:42.900
No problem. We'll have Jeannie
and Tamara work on it this week.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.473
Listen, why can't you work
on it, Marty?

06:44.507 --> 06:46.344
I've been subpoenaed
to be deposed in Nebraska

06:46.382 --> 06:47.885
this week.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.123
Uh, the p&g telecom
subcontractor case?

06:49.157 --> 06:50.758
You might have seen it
on the news.

06:50.792 --> 06:51.926
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.394
Some guy fell off a cell tower,

06:53.429 --> 06:54.896
and he's trying
to hold p&g liable.

06:54.930 --> 06:56.064
It's corporate rape.

06:56.098 --> 06:57.531
Look, I don't give a shit

06:57.566 --> 06:59.133
about some Mickey mouse
subpoena, Marty.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.668
Don't offend me.

07:00.702 --> 07:02.570
You stay.

07:02.604 --> 07:04.671
It's my legal obligation.

07:04.706 --> 07:06.206
It's your choice.

07:06.241 --> 07:07.374
Or it's

07:07.408 --> 07:08.875
my legal obligation.

07:08.910 --> 07:10.778
Or it's your choice.

07:10.812 --> 07:12.112
Mmm.
Uh, this is...

07:12.146 --> 07:13.279
Mmm.
It is...

07:13.314 --> 07:14.513
(Chittering)

07:14.548 --> 07:17.683
(Laughing):
So...

07:17.718 --> 07:19.619
Well, we leave
in about an hour,

07:19.653 --> 07:21.454
so, uh, how about I just
call you when we land?

07:21.488 --> 07:22.722
Yeah, you, too.

07:22.756 --> 07:24.190
All right, bye, lover.

07:24.224 --> 07:26.125
(Sighs)

07:28.728 --> 07:30.295
Okay. What?

07:30.330 --> 07:32.164
What what?

07:32.198 --> 07:33.766
What what?
Yeah.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.635
The Sarah thing you do.

07:35.669 --> 07:37.471
Every time I talk about
Sarah, or talk to Sarah,

07:37.505 --> 07:40.574
you do a thing. What thing?
What are you talking about?

07:40.608 --> 07:43.276
I was sitting here. I just saw it,
just then as I was walking past.

07:43.310 --> 07:45.511
You went, "aah!" That. That
thing. That's what I do?

07:45.545 --> 07:47.312
<i>This... Aah! Yes. You
just did it then before.</i>

07:47.346 --> 07:49.544
I've never in my life done that.
You've been doing it for weeks.

07:49.578 --> 07:51.010
In my entire life,
I've never done that.

07:51.044 --> 07:52.974
You have been doing it for
weeks, and I'm sick of it.

07:53.009 --> 07:54.575
Oh, my... No, I'm not. You have. No.

07:54.609 --> 07:56.576
What you are right now,
honestly, is insanely sensitive.

07:56.611 --> 07:58.145
Say, Jeannie, could
you please tell Clyde

07:58.179 --> 08:00.079
that I'm-I'm not
talking to him anymore?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.780
Oh, thank you for that gift.
I hate when you talk.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.382
Jeannie:
Clyde, Clyde, please just

08:03.416 --> 08:05.083
apologize to Doug
for whatever, being a dick,

08:05.117 --> 08:06.785
so we can focus
on more important things,

08:06.819 --> 08:07.986
like that fact that

08:08.020 --> 08:09.822
I'm gonna be stuck
working with Tamara.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.490
Also, Marty's hitting it.
It's confirmed.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.324
Clyde:
He's just living it.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.492
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

08:14.526 --> 08:15.660
Who's hitting...
Who's hitting the what?

08:15.695 --> 08:17.227
Oh, my God.
Are you being serious?

08:17.262 --> 08:19.127
It's the thing we've been
speculating for the past week.

08:19.161 --> 08:20.460
You don't remember this, Doug?

08:20.493 --> 08:21.626
Marty. Okay, that's interesting.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.695
So, Tamara and Sarah
got along really well

08:23.730 --> 08:25.064
at the retreat, I thought.

08:25.099 --> 08:26.734
Didn't you think?
Clyde: No, no, no. Doug,

08:26.769 --> 08:28.436
Marty's never gonna go
on a double date

08:28.471 --> 08:30.271
with you and fucking girl Doug.

08:30.306 --> 08:31.837
Is somebody talking?
Is somebody talking?

08:31.871 --> 08:33.501
I can't hear anything.

08:33.534 --> 08:35.500
(Indistinct chatter,
phones ringing)

08:37.602 --> 08:39.269
Marty motherfucking

08:39.304 --> 08:41.472
kaan.

08:41.508 --> 08:43.576
(Laughs) Hey, man.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.511
Hey. (Clears throat) Long time.

08:45.545 --> 08:47.212
Shit. It's been a lifetime.

08:47.247 --> 08:48.647
Yeah.

08:48.681 --> 08:52.083
What are you...
What are you doing here?

08:52.118 --> 08:53.351
Looking for Tamara?

08:53.385 --> 08:55.253
(Sighs) I tried to take
my wife to lunch,

08:55.287 --> 08:57.088
but she turned me down.
Ah.

08:57.122 --> 08:59.756
"You show up like my job's
not important, motherfucker."

08:59.791 --> 09:02.091
(Laughs)
Shit. Ouch.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.292
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.326 --> 09:04.560
Oh, have a seat, Kevin.

09:04.595 --> 09:05.728
Oh, thanks, man.

09:05.763 --> 09:07.730
Yeah.
Thanks.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.266
So...
(Clears throat)

09:10.300 --> 09:12.201
how is life?
Mmm.

09:12.236 --> 09:14.670
Uh, how's New York?
Ugh!

09:14.705 --> 09:16.973
Commute is kicking my ass,
getting back here to see

09:17.007 --> 09:18.975
my girls. You know,
I thought t would have

09:19.010 --> 09:22.010
changed her mind by now,
but she is so fucking stubborn.

09:22.045 --> 09:23.178
Yeah.
(Laughs)

09:23.212 --> 09:25.314
I don't even own keys
to my goddamn house.

09:25.349 --> 09:28.151
She changed the locks
on a brother.

09:28.186 --> 09:30.153
Oh. Trying to get back
in the house, huh?

09:30.188 --> 09:32.455
It's still my fucking house.
Yeah.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.123
(Laughing) True that.

09:34.158 --> 09:35.691
Yeah, man.
True that.

09:35.725 --> 09:37.993
Hey. I know you have
the inside scoop.

09:38.027 --> 09:39.394
You've always been a...

09:39.429 --> 09:40.462
Good friend.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.464
And lately, t's been...

09:42.498 --> 09:45.067
Fucking me.

09:45.101 --> 09:46.869
I'm sorry. What?

09:49.139 --> 09:51.407
I'm sleeping with your wife.

09:58.116 --> 10:00.050
(Inhales, exhales)

10:00.084 --> 10:01.818
That's what I like
about you, Marty.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.319
You shoot straight.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.355
Yeah. Well...
So do I.

10:05.389 --> 10:06.990
Not really.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.726
I mean, this little
bullshit conversation,

10:09.760 --> 10:13.062
uh, impromptu reunion,
I-it's recon, Kevin.

10:13.097 --> 10:15.164
So let me just give you

10:15.199 --> 10:16.732
the full format, okay?

10:16.767 --> 10:20.035
I am... sleeping with Tamara.

10:20.070 --> 10:22.405
I... I like
sleeping with Tamara.

10:22.439 --> 10:24.006
I'm gonna sleep...

10:24.040 --> 10:26.708
Keep... sleeping with Tamara.

10:26.743 --> 10:28.543
Uh-huh.

10:28.578 --> 10:31.413
And that is kind of it.

10:31.447 --> 10:33.581
Unless you want the details.

10:33.616 --> 10:35.249
Oh, no, no, no.

10:35.284 --> 10:37.552
I'm-I'm good.
Me, too.

10:37.586 --> 10:40.588
(Chuckling): Oh, yeah,
I'm sure. I'm sure.

10:41.791 --> 10:46.328
So, uh, I have got
to catch a plane.

10:46.362 --> 10:47.929
A plane?
Yeah.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.031
Yeah.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.433
I guess I'll be out,
leave you to your...

10:51.467 --> 10:53.402
Work.
Stuff. (Laughs loudly)

10:54.471 --> 10:56.439
Work.
Yeah.

10:56.473 --> 10:59.175
Fucking my wife.

10:59.210 --> 11:01.177
See you later, Marty.

11:02.213 --> 11:04.714
Good talk, homeboy, good talk.

11:09.454 --> 11:11.590
So, the guy who fell
off the cell tower...

11:11.624 --> 11:13.526
Yeah, the Vic's name
is, uh, ray marburger.

11:13.561 --> 11:15.229
Yeah, I wouldn't call
him "Vic," Doug.

11:15.263 --> 11:16.696
It means, uh...
It means "victim."

11:16.731 --> 11:18.398
I understand what
the fuck it means.

11:18.432 --> 11:21.034
Yeah. He worked for one of p&g's
bush-league subcontractors.

11:21.068 --> 11:23.704
And they're trying to prove
that the subcontracting model

11:23.738 --> 11:25.706
was put in place
to avoid liability...

11:25.740 --> 11:27.708
Right. Which, of course, it was.

11:27.743 --> 11:30.411
Of course it was. I'm the
one who pitched it, remember?

11:30.445 --> 11:32.346
Oh, God, I was
kind of "the man"

11:32.381 --> 11:35.850
after that p&g consult-- but
you probably knew that, right?

11:35.884 --> 11:37.151
Yeah, look,
we all remember it, Clyde.

11:37.185 --> 11:39.253
That was when your mom
sent us that tin of cookies.

11:39.288 --> 11:41.756
(Laughing): If you could even
call them that. Do not talk

11:41.790 --> 11:43.759
about my mom's cookies.
Well, how about I call them

11:43.793 --> 11:45.995
"dog biscuits," 'cause
that's what they tasted like.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.433
Doug, you know what, my mom
worked a 60-hour work week,

11:48.467 --> 11:50.204
so I'm sorry if her cookies
didn't meet the standards

11:50.238 --> 11:52.343
of your fucking
dog-biscuit-eating palate.

11:52.377 --> 11:54.514
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that a bit below the belt?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.449
Well, so was hitting
on my girlfriend, asshole.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.485
Marty: Oh! Doug's balls
dropped. Doug: Well, the love

11:59.520 --> 12:01.654
of a good woman
will do that to a man.

12:01.689 --> 12:02.923
Am I right, ta-Marty?

12:04.392 --> 12:05.692
Huh? Tamara-Marty?

12:05.727 --> 12:07.160
(Chuckles) It's one
of those uninames.

12:07.195 --> 12:08.995
Like kimye or Brangelina.

12:09.030 --> 12:10.463
No.
I thought of that.

12:10.498 --> 12:12.065
Hey, you know,
Sara and I have been,

12:12.100 --> 12:14.534
uh, looking for a couple to
hang out with. Oh, my God.

12:14.569 --> 12:16.337
Thinking this trip
might be a good chance

12:16.371 --> 12:18.274
for the two of us
to Bond or something.

12:18.309 --> 12:20.078
Just two guys loving
love. Yeah? (Laughs)

12:20.112 --> 12:22.448
And here's where Clyde
says... Shut the fuck up, Doug.

12:22.483 --> 12:25.385
That's what he says. Nope, can't
hear him, can't hear a thing.

12:28.723 --> 12:30.124
Yeah, I heard that.

12:30.158 --> 12:31.661
Yeah. You did hear that, huh?

12:31.695 --> 12:33.366
Yeah, but not that.
Oh, really?

12:33.400 --> 12:34.871
I'll give it to you
one more time.

12:34.905 --> 12:36.674
♪ Shut the fuck up ♪
♪ no, I'm not listening ♪

12:36.709 --> 12:38.977
♪ shut the fuck up... ♪
♪ to you, not listening... ♪

12:43.615 --> 12:45.951
(Horns honking)

12:45.985 --> 12:47.819
Here you go.
Cup of Joe.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.254
Oh.
(Laughs)

12:49.289 --> 12:50.856
Kind of--
but thank you.

12:50.891 --> 12:53.225
That's fine.
Ugh, yuck.

12:53.260 --> 12:55.027
Do you know, if we lived here,

12:55.062 --> 12:57.129
<i>that would count
as quality ass? That.</i>

12:57.164 --> 12:59.766
Clyde thinking he's better
than everyone else yet again.

12:59.801 --> 13:01.035
Not everybody.

13:01.070 --> 13:02.872
But her, yes.
Why?

13:02.906 --> 13:04.206
That woman is not an indication

13:04.241 --> 13:05.608
of everyone in Omaha.

13:05.642 --> 13:07.744
Kid, wait one second.
I got to ask you a question.

13:07.778 --> 13:09.846
What do the girls
look like in your class?

13:09.881 --> 13:11.749
They're all kind of gross.

13:11.783 --> 13:13.784
"They're all kind of gross."

13:13.819 --> 13:14.919
He got a bad class; Big deal.

13:14.953 --> 13:16.754
Listen to me-- you
should move to L.A.

13:16.788 --> 13:17.821
And, kid,

13:17.855 --> 13:18.989
it gets better.

13:19.023 --> 13:20.124
"It gets better"?

13:20.159 --> 13:22.160
You know that's a psa
for gay teens?

13:22.195 --> 13:24.095
A struggle is a struggle.
Doesn't matter what you say...

13:24.130 --> 13:25.263
Man:
Sorry to keep you.

13:25.298 --> 13:27.031
Neil savage, counsel for p&g.
Oh.

13:27.066 --> 13:28.666
Doug guggenheim.
Clyde oberholt.

13:28.701 --> 13:31.303
Would you like a coffee?
No, thanks. I'm fine.

13:31.338 --> 13:34.139
(Sighs) Mr. kaan
is already being deposed.

13:34.173 --> 13:35.140
Yeah.
I'm just here

13:35.174 --> 13:36.474
to prep you for tomorrow.

13:36.508 --> 13:37.808
Any questions?

13:37.843 --> 13:38.809
Yeah. Like a million.

13:38.843 --> 13:40.144
Uh, any land mines I need

13:40.178 --> 13:41.845
to watch out for?
I'm kind of nervous.

13:41.879 --> 13:42.879
Clyde:
Doug, we're not getting

13:42.913 --> 13:43.947
water-boarded here--
I don't think

13:43.981 --> 13:45.716
you have to worry
about land mines.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.284
Oh. Uh...
Oh, shoot!

13:47.318 --> 13:49.419
It got it on my folder
and everything.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.954
Excuse me for a second.

13:50.989 --> 13:52.723
(Laughing):
I know. Goodness!

13:52.757 --> 13:54.291
I apologize for my friend.

13:54.325 --> 13:56.460
Well, I'll bring
you up to speed.

13:56.494 --> 13:59.296
Uh, the guy's widow has a
pretty effective narrative.

13:59.330 --> 14:02.065
Mm-hmm. Works two jobs,
single mom, she's been,

14:02.099 --> 14:03.966
uh, sitting in on some
of the depositions,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.901
and she's been educating herself
via the goddamn Internet.

14:06.935 --> 14:09.204
(Quiet chuckle)
She brought the kid, too.

14:09.238 --> 14:11.406
Smart play.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.175
So, Mr. oberholt,

14:13.209 --> 14:14.710
you came up with
the subcontractor

14:14.744 --> 14:16.845
business model, right?
I did. That was me.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.248
But to cut costs;
I'm not a safety expert.

14:19.282 --> 14:21.884
Well, they're gonna try to put
you in the crosshairs on this.

14:21.918 --> 14:23.352
That's crazy--
I didn't force this guy

14:23.386 --> 14:25.054
to get a job climbing
cell phone towers.

14:25.088 --> 14:26.922
And that's p&g's position. Good.

14:26.955 --> 14:29.688
These guys are adrenaline
junkies trying to get high

14:29.723 --> 14:31.189
for minimum wage.

14:31.224 --> 14:32.991
And even with
the so-called

14:33.025 --> 14:36.760
questionable safety regs,
there's no way his wife

14:36.795 --> 14:39.362
proves p&g was negligent.

14:39.396 --> 14:42.231
<i>P&g's tracks are covered,</i>

14:42.265 --> 14:45.734
thanks to your...
Is "genius"

14:45.768 --> 14:47.468
too big a word?
Uh, Neil, okay...

14:47.503 --> 14:48.836
Brilliant, what you've done.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.005
Clyde: So, what's going to happen

14:52.039 --> 14:54.173
to, um... her and the kid?

14:54.207 --> 14:57.175
Ah, she hired some
high-profile local attorney,

14:57.209 --> 14:59.043
but he's in over his head.
Yeah.

14:59.078 --> 15:01.679
She's a single mom,
works at a stop and go.

15:01.714 --> 15:04.082
There's a 25-grand
insurance payout

15:04.117 --> 15:05.550
on the table.

15:05.585 --> 15:07.452
That's more money
than she's ever seen.

15:07.487 --> 15:09.354
It's business.

15:09.389 --> 15:11.357
(Quietly):
It's business.

15:14.494 --> 15:16.362
<i>Jeannie:
How are the kids?</i>

15:16.396 --> 15:18.764
Oh, they're great.
They're up north

15:18.799 --> 15:20.266
with my mom.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.700
That's nice.

15:21.735 --> 15:23.569
You know, we don't
always have to talk

15:23.603 --> 15:25.069
about my kids when we're alone.

15:25.104 --> 15:26.604
We don't?

15:26.639 --> 15:27.872
Whew!

15:27.907 --> 15:29.273
(Laughing):
Especially when I know that

15:29.308 --> 15:31.375
that's not really what
you want to talk about.

15:31.410 --> 15:34.612
You and Marty sleeping together
is none of my business.

15:36.582 --> 15:38.817
You're right,
it's none of your business.

15:38.852 --> 15:40.452
(Chuckles)

15:40.487 --> 15:41.987
But that's not what
I was talking about.

15:43.022 --> 15:46.157
Oh. (Laughs) I was talking

15:46.192 --> 15:48.960
about him opening up
his own shop.

15:48.994 --> 15:50.962
He told you?

15:50.996 --> 15:52.831
Because it was...

15:52.865 --> 15:55.467
Kind of my idea.

15:56.503 --> 15:58.137
(Laughs softly)

15:58.171 --> 15:59.805
(Laughs softly) (Giggles)

15:59.840 --> 16:00.873
(Clears throat)

16:00.907 --> 16:03.375
So, are you leaving
galweather, too?

16:05.144 --> 16:07.112
To go with Marty?
(Laughing)

16:07.147 --> 16:08.580
That's funny, apparently.

16:08.615 --> 16:10.449
No, it's just, you know,

16:10.484 --> 16:14.420
I'm-I'm not 14
chasing around some boy I like

16:14.454 --> 16:16.288
just because.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.790
Yeah, new firm, I don't know.

16:17.824 --> 16:19.725
High risk, high reward, right?

16:19.760 --> 16:20.993
Yeah, well,

16:21.028 --> 16:22.795
you know Marty--
he's got nine lives.

16:22.829 --> 16:25.197
I don't know how many I have.

16:28.301 --> 16:29.635
(Knocking)

16:29.669 --> 16:31.971
Yo.

16:32.005 --> 16:33.038
Hi.

16:33.073 --> 16:35.941
(Laughs)
Look what the cat dragged in.

16:35.975 --> 16:38.943
What's up, little
brother? (Laughs)

16:39.979 --> 16:42.180
Oh. Roscoe was
looking for those.

16:42.214 --> 16:44.416
Yeah. His music
sounds like shit

16:44.450 --> 16:45.884
with those earbuds.

16:45.918 --> 16:48.520
He's really into mixtapes now.

16:48.554 --> 16:50.221
Yep. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

16:51.257 --> 16:53.158
Heard you were in town.

16:53.192 --> 16:54.192
Mm-hmm.

16:54.226 --> 16:56.027
Mm-hmm. (Laughs)

16:58.096 --> 16:59.964
Causing trouble,

16:59.998 --> 17:01.065
<i>I hope.</i>

17:01.100 --> 17:02.467
You know how I do.

17:02.501 --> 17:05.203
You got the good stuff open.
Again.

17:05.237 --> 17:07.204
You know how I do.
Ah!

17:07.239 --> 17:08.506
(Both laugh)

17:08.540 --> 17:10.875
You know, I would
offer you something to eat.

17:10.909 --> 17:12.076
Uh-huh.

17:12.109 --> 17:13.911
I hear you're into
Sushi these days,

17:13.944 --> 17:15.313
but I'm fresh out.

17:15.347 --> 17:17.115
(Chuckles) Yeah, I have had

17:17.148 --> 17:19.251
a lot of Sushi
lately, haven't I?

17:19.285 --> 17:21.286
(Clears throat)

17:21.319 --> 17:22.521
Thank you.

17:24.022 --> 17:26.858
Oh, it's really
good to see you.

17:26.893 --> 17:29.227
(Exhales)

17:31.864 --> 17:35.068
You want to know a secret?

17:35.103 --> 17:38.006
Depends.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.841
What if I told you

17:39.875 --> 17:44.212
that I know you used
to masturbate to me

17:44.246 --> 17:46.214
when you were younger.

17:46.249 --> 17:48.283
(Whispers):
Marty told me.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.418
(Laughs quietly)

17:50.452 --> 17:52.320
(Laughs)

17:52.354 --> 17:53.554
Yeah.

17:53.589 --> 17:55.723
You were in heavy rotation.

17:55.758 --> 17:59.394
Yeah. What if I told you

17:59.428 --> 18:05.102
that I used to think about you
and touch myself, too?

18:05.136 --> 18:07.705
Shit, you should've
let a brother know.

18:07.739 --> 18:09.540
I'm all about family ties.

18:09.574 --> 18:11.809
Oh, really?
Yeah.

18:11.843 --> 18:15.545
Oh, God, you used
to be so hot...

18:15.580 --> 18:19.450
In that jv uniform.
(Whispers): What?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.822
Go, mustangs.
(Chuckles)

18:24.856 --> 18:28.795
(Moans softly)

18:30.832 --> 18:32.900
Oh, Monica.

18:34.503 --> 18:37.506
Come here.
(Moans)

18:39.509 --> 18:40.742
Nope.

18:40.777 --> 18:42.077
(Moans)

18:42.111 --> 18:43.145
No, no, no, listen.
No.

18:43.179 --> 18:44.179
No way.

18:45.348 --> 18:47.115
No.
Come on.

18:47.150 --> 18:48.750
(Moans, chuckles)

18:48.785 --> 18:50.218
(Both moaning)

18:50.252 --> 18:52.087
Don't stop.

18:52.122 --> 18:53.956
(Glass breaking)

18:53.990 --> 18:55.291
You like that?

18:56.359 --> 18:58.828
Here's your key,
Mr. guggenheim.

18:58.862 --> 19:00.829
Oh.
And Mr. oberholt.

19:00.864 --> 19:03.966
And you're sure that's
it, only two rooms? Uh,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.168
under the galweather
corporate account,

19:06.203 --> 19:08.170
uh, I don't see any Martin kaan.

19:08.205 --> 19:09.672
Oh, goodness.
Someone messed up.

19:09.706 --> 19:11.440
Oh, goodness.

19:11.474 --> 19:13.242
Uh, unfortunately,
we're fully committed,

19:13.276 --> 19:14.710
and the city's booked.

19:14.744 --> 19:16.712
Cornhusker awards.
That's fantastic.

19:16.746 --> 19:19.147
Somebody's gonna have to bunk up. Yeah.

19:19.182 --> 19:21.483
Somebody's gonna have
to do that.

19:25.556 --> 19:27.457
(Chuckles)

19:27.492 --> 19:28.959
Um...

19:28.993 --> 19:30.895
Oh, Doug, you didn't have to. That's...

19:30.929 --> 19:33.564
Actually, you did.
Right.

19:33.598 --> 19:35.899
Happy bunking!
How about I throw in a free

19:35.934 --> 19:37.367
continental breakfast for you?

19:37.402 --> 19:39.303
Could you just check one
more time? Are you sure

19:39.337 --> 19:40.704
there's no other rooms?

19:40.739 --> 19:42.707
No, no. Clyde: And how
many beds... How many beds

19:42.741 --> 19:44.141
are in the room that we have?

19:44.175 --> 19:45.809
One elegant queen.

19:46.844 --> 19:50.012
Doug:
All right. What do we got here?

19:50.047 --> 19:52.048
Come on.

19:52.082 --> 19:55.851
Got to be
something. Ooh.

19:55.886 --> 19:57.553
Jackpot. Yeah.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.089
There's a best Western
16.8 Miles away.

20:00.123 --> 20:02.057
Bet you they got rooms.

20:02.092 --> 20:04.659
All right, man, if you want to
go, go. I don't give a fuck.

20:04.694 --> 20:06.662
The room's not for me, Clyde.

20:06.696 --> 20:09.698
♪ If you should leave me,
I'd die ♪

20:09.733 --> 20:12.234
♪ lord knows the reason why ♪

20:12.269 --> 20:14.737
Good night, Clyde.
Shut up, Doug.

20:14.771 --> 20:17.907
♪ What is this feeling
that you do ♪

20:17.941 --> 20:22.176
♪ that makes me
so attracted to you? ♪

20:23.211 --> 20:25.712
Nope. (Chuckles)
No. Come on, buddy.

20:25.747 --> 20:27.380
Be reasonable.
I need...

20:27.414 --> 20:28.815
I need a little bit
of comfort, buddy.

20:28.849 --> 20:30.050
Just give me a little bit.

20:30.084 --> 20:31.550
Stop being a child.

20:31.585 --> 20:32.885
I'm a fucking child?
Look how you're dressed,

20:32.920 --> 20:35.054
you fucking idiot. Fuck it.
Give it to me.

20:35.088 --> 20:36.221
Whatever. I'm not going
to sleep anyway.

20:36.256 --> 20:38.090
Fine, that's your prerogative.

20:38.124 --> 20:39.692
Keep the lights on, okay?

20:39.726 --> 20:41.694
The depo is at 7:00 A.M.!
I need seven hours' sleep,

20:41.728 --> 20:42.928
and you know that.
I know what time

20:42.962 --> 20:44.963
the goddamn deposition is, Doug.
Good night.

20:44.997 --> 20:46.998
The lights are on.
Goddamn it! All right, fine.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.800
You want to talk? We'll talk.
Here we go.

20:48.834 --> 20:50.301
Let's nip this
in the bud right now.

20:50.335 --> 20:52.202
Yes, I am happy.
Yes, I have a girlfriend.

20:52.237 --> 20:54.639
Oh, my God! And I apologize
if that fucks with your sense

20:54.673 --> 20:56.907
of how the world works. This has
nothing to do with you and Sarah!

20:56.942 --> 20:58.542
What's it about, then?
You tell me. What is it?

20:58.577 --> 21:00.978
The-the-the hotel room?
Stop. Shut the fuck up.

21:01.012 --> 21:03.947
The duvet? What? The-the
deposition? No. No. The duvet?

21:03.982 --> 21:05.148
(Sighs)

21:07.585 --> 21:10.621
The deposition?
It's...

21:10.655 --> 21:12.623
Well, look, I get it.

21:12.658 --> 21:16.261
I-I know I put up a steely
front, but I'll admit it, buddy.

21:16.295 --> 21:18.329
I'm-I'm kind of
a little freaked-out, too.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.265
Oh, you're a little freaked-out?
Yes, I am.

21:20.299 --> 21:22.234
Okay, tomorrow, I have to
defend myself on something

21:22.268 --> 21:24.335
that I put into motion.
That's me. I did it.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.237
And now we have p&g, which just

21:26.272 --> 21:27.939
covers us like a fucking
corporate veil.

21:27.973 --> 21:29.307
That's a good thing.

21:29.341 --> 21:31.342
No.
That's what we do.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.677
Yeah, well, it's
fucked-up, okay?

21:32.711 --> 21:34.345
We don't even think
about what happens

21:34.379 --> 21:36.347
when we leave.
We don't give a fuck.

21:36.381 --> 21:38.383
I don't give a fuck.

21:38.417 --> 21:40.018
And honestly, most of the time,

21:40.052 --> 21:41.486
I'm fine with that.

21:41.521 --> 21:43.288
Corporate downsizing.
People lose their jobs.

21:43.323 --> 21:44.623
That's what fucking happens,

21:44.657 --> 21:46.125
and everybody knows that's
the way the world works.

21:46.159 --> 21:47.860
I can't stop that.
That's what it is.

21:47.894 --> 21:50.129
Right.

21:50.163 --> 21:53.499
But someone died
because I want to make partner

21:53.533 --> 21:56.202
before I'm 35.
What?

21:56.236 --> 21:58.805
No. No, that's not...
Yes.

21:58.839 --> 22:02.509
That's what you... (Sighs)
That... you can't...

22:02.543 --> 22:05.445
No. That's a very
simplistic way of-of...

22:05.479 --> 22:07.647
There were other factors
you're not thinking about.

22:07.681 --> 22:09.148
Okay, yeah.

22:09.183 --> 22:11.418
At the end of the day,
there's now a kid

22:11.452 --> 22:13.854
that's going to grow up
without a father.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.259
(Sighs)

22:21.562 --> 22:23.530
Okay.

22:25.433 --> 22:28.801
You know, uh, when I was sad,

22:28.835 --> 22:33.172
my mom used to open up
the Doug-hug emporium.

22:33.207 --> 22:34.907
Doug-hug emporium?
That's right.

22:34.941 --> 22:36.909
I can't do this, Doug.
Yeah.

22:36.943 --> 22:39.345
You buy one, you get one free.

22:39.379 --> 22:42.681
That's the emporium's
signature policy.

22:42.716 --> 22:45.951
And we are open for
business. Doug, I don't...

22:45.986 --> 22:47.286
Come here.
Doug.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.654
It's okay.

22:48.688 --> 22:50.490
Here we go.
Doug, honestly, this is...

22:50.524 --> 22:52.492
It's okay, buddy.
I don't want a hug.

22:52.526 --> 22:54.327
It's okay.
You're all right. Shh.

22:54.362 --> 22:56.664
Just, shh.
Jesus! You're so strong.

22:56.698 --> 22:59.066
Yeah, I know. From all
that hugging. (Chuckles)

22:59.100 --> 23:02.169
(Sighs)

23:10.479 --> 23:12.446
Is that your dick against me? What?

23:12.481 --> 23:15.116
Are you hard right now? From
hugging me? No. No, no, no.

23:15.150 --> 23:17.718
You got fucking hard? I'm not...
calm down. It's a penlight.

23:17.752 --> 23:19.219
Holy shit.
Just a penlight.

23:19.254 --> 23:20.554
For-for nighttime emergencies.

23:20.588 --> 23:22.556
Okay. Well, don't forget you still have

23:22.590 --> 23:24.525
one free hug
on your buy-one-get-one-free.

23:24.559 --> 23:26.861
Take care, buddy. Come on.
No, they work better in pairs.

23:26.895 --> 23:28.429
I'm telling you
right now, get off me

23:28.463 --> 23:30.197
or I'll fucking kill you.
Okay. Okay. O-okay.

23:30.232 --> 23:32.533
I'll kill you.
Ow, ow. Okay.

23:32.568 --> 23:35.102
Good night, Doug.
Good night.

23:44.446 --> 23:46.883
(Horn honks)

23:46.917 --> 23:49.119
(Sighs) Hey.

23:49.153 --> 23:52.422
How was the depo? Oh, well,
Douglas guggenheim and I

23:52.457 --> 23:53.757
shared an elegant queen.

23:53.791 --> 23:55.792
You did not.
Yeah, we did.

23:55.826 --> 23:57.661
How was Carlson?
Did you know that banging

23:57.695 --> 23:59.530
your head against a wall
can burn up to

23:59.564 --> 24:01.732
150 calories per hour? Doug:
Oh, yeah? That bad, huh?

24:01.766 --> 24:03.968
Yeah, well, at least
he finally agreed on a draft.

24:04.002 --> 24:06.871
Which is pretty much the same
as the original draft.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.139
Hi, guys. Where's Marty?

24:08.173 --> 24:09.907
Doug:
I don't know. Oh.

24:09.941 --> 24:11.742
Tamara, Tamara, Tamara,
uh, speaking of Marty,

24:11.776 --> 24:13.744
are you two interested
in coming

24:13.778 --> 24:15.178
to the comedy connection
this weekend?

24:15.213 --> 24:16.479
I have two extra tickets.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.916
With you and Sarah?

24:18.950 --> 24:20.585
No. No, no, no. No, not...

24:20.619 --> 24:22.353
I mean, we might be
at the same table.

24:22.388 --> 24:23.921
Maybe. I'll-I'll check
on the...

24:23.956 --> 24:26.357
I-I'll put you down as a maybe.
Put her down as a maybe.

24:26.392 --> 24:28.293
Put her down as a maybe.
That's a maybe. All right.

24:28.327 --> 24:31.596
(Scoffs)
Take one fucking week off.

24:31.630 --> 24:33.497
What the fuck, Marty?

24:33.531 --> 24:34.966
What...

24:35.000 --> 24:37.702
You told Kevin
we're sleeping together?

24:37.736 --> 24:39.470
Aw, poor Kevin.

24:39.505 --> 24:40.504
You're unbelievable.

24:40.539 --> 24:42.473
What are we doing?

24:42.507 --> 24:44.074
I don't know,
but you're stepping all over

24:44.109 --> 24:45.776
my goddamn boundaries.
I don't do well

24:45.810 --> 24:46.810
with boundaries,

24:46.845 --> 24:48.145
Tamara, but...

24:48.179 --> 24:50.648
The question remains.
(Sighs)

24:50.682 --> 24:54.317
I don't know. I don't know.
You tell me.

24:54.352 --> 24:56.486
Listen, I...

25:00.491 --> 25:02.493
I'm...
(Sighs)

25:04.462 --> 25:08.899
(Quietly): I'm trying to
have something... with you.

25:08.934 --> 25:11.101
So you come in and
you blow up my spot?

25:11.136 --> 25:12.903
I thought you were done
with that life.

25:12.937 --> 25:14.872
What? Honey, it's
not that simple.

25:14.906 --> 25:17.474
Shit, t.
It... it can be.

25:17.508 --> 25:19.543
What, because you say so?

25:19.577 --> 25:21.645
Yes.

25:23.281 --> 25:24.848
Yes.

25:27.619 --> 25:29.486
(Chuckles)

25:29.520 --> 25:33.490
I'm a simple man.
Like hell you are.

25:43.602 --> 25:47.237
♪ You're dressed
in a memory... ♪

25:50.374 --> 25:51.441
Mon!

25:51.475 --> 25:54.411
Babe!
(Laughs)

25:54.445 --> 25:56.246
Not dead!

25:56.280 --> 25:59.248
Yes, you... great
surprise, thank you.

25:59.283 --> 26:02.018
(Sighs, chuckles)
Babe, it's cold out here.

26:02.052 --> 26:05.188
Oh, no. I think
it feels amazing.

26:05.222 --> 26:08.558
Oh, hello, my friends.

26:08.592 --> 26:12.262
What shall
I have today? You?

26:12.296 --> 26:13.896
No, you do...
What are you doing?

26:13.931 --> 26:15.464
Oh, you want some? Oh!

26:15.499 --> 26:16.766
Too slow!

26:16.800 --> 26:18.768
(Laughs)

26:18.802 --> 26:21.771
(Snorts, exhales)

26:21.805 --> 26:23.773
So, what,
Roscoe decides to leave

26:23.807 --> 26:25.942
and you go back to this shit?

26:25.977 --> 26:28.411
After everything you did to
fix your relationship with him.

26:28.446 --> 26:30.780
To fix yourself.
I'm unfixable.

26:30.814 --> 26:33.950
You can ask Marty.
You can ask my mom.

26:33.984 --> 26:35.318
That's not true. You
can ask... I don't know.

26:35.352 --> 26:36.653
Who else can we ask?

26:36.687 --> 26:38.522
I tried.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.791
Okay? I tried.

26:40.825 --> 26:43.361
I tried to be
a happy homemaker.

26:43.395 --> 26:44.695
Healthy living. Live-in chef.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.863
Mommy of the fucking year!

26:46.897 --> 26:49.464
And I let you,

26:49.498 --> 26:51.130
a sweet little kid,

26:51.164 --> 26:53.465
