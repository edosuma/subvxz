00:44.120 --> 00:47.169
- Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Hi!
- I did not know that about Erica.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.129
- Hi, Max! Hi.
- Hi!

00:49.520 --> 00:54.321
You have one little corner
of baby smell left right there.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.051
- Hi, how are you?
- I need a baby!

00:57.160 --> 00:58.764
You need a baby?

00:58.840 --> 01:01.411
You're such an impatient little fussbudget.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.881
I just don't see why I should wait.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.364
For a father, perhaps?

01:05.800 --> 01:07.086
Let's face it.

01:07.160 --> 01:11.245
I've never been in a serious relationship
that's lasted longer than six months.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.526
We were together for two years.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.601
Thanks.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.968
In college. And we made each other
miserable the rest of the time.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.405
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.087
I admit it, we were miserable,

01:22.160 --> 01:24.527
- but we were also happy.
- Yeah.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.726
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.004
Well, just so you know,
I have some sperm in a facility uptown,

01:30.080 --> 01:31.605
if you're in a pinch.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.920
What? Why?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.128
I thought Felicia
didn't want any more kids.

01:35.240 --> 01:39.290
Felicia does not want any more kids.
I froze it in case I met someone nice.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.126
No, you didn't.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.886
I didn't.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.602
But I might.
You know, save it like mad money style.

01:49.720 --> 01:54.169
So do you remember
Guy Childers from college?

01:54.600 --> 01:57.888
Wait, wasn't he the guy, he now...
What, he's a pickle salesman, right?

01:57.960 --> 02:00.327
No, he's a pickle entrepreneur.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.731
I'm just gonna touch these.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.482
And he agreed to make a donation,
so that I could inseminate myself.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.763
- But he has no sense of personal space.
- So what? He was a math major.

02:12.840 --> 02:16.640
And I'm not gonna marry him.
I'm just borrowing his genes.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.405
But not his personality, I hope.
Guy Childers?

02:19.480 --> 02:21.528
Well, everybody's got something
a little bit wrong with them.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.807
You think everybody's honest
who fills out those questionnaires

02:23.880 --> 02:25.564
at the sperm bank donation thing?

02:25.640 --> 02:28.166
I can't believe you've been cooking this up
and you didn't even tell me.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.811
- Because I knew that you'd yell at me.
- I'm not yelling at you...

02:30.920 --> 02:34.925
Isn't this something that women do
who are, like, 49 and desperate?

02:35.040 --> 02:36.849
I don't want it to be a last resort.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.402
I want it to be a choice
because I'm ready to be a mother,

02:40.480 --> 02:43.882
and I don't believe that I'll find someone
that I can stay in love with

02:43.960 --> 02:47.760
or who can stay in love with me
for longer than six months.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.605
I'm just facing the truth about myself.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.809
So when's the insemination?
Are we gonna have a party?

02:56.160 --> 02:57.730
In four months.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.128
Hey, does my breath smell?

03:04.520 --> 03:07.126
No. Does mine?

03:22.800 --> 03:25.041
I started production in my apartment
three years ago.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.088
Now, I have 12 employees.

03:27.720 --> 03:32.044
And I just got an order from Whole Foods.
So if that works out, we're taking off.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.691
But I'm still very hands-on.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.488
Every pickle has my stamp
of approval on it.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.724
Here, try this one.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.246
I love this.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.641
That's a Bavarian. It's classic.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.611
This is the best pickle I've ever had.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.885
- You skate?
- Yeah. Every Sunday.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.564
I grew up on the ice.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.689
- Right. You were on the ice hockey team.
- Yeah.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.844
I used to ice-skate a lot
when I was little.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.845
- So regarding our plan.
- Okay.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.446
Here

04:15.880 --> 04:17.689
is my bill of health.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.446
Read it.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.920
That's great.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.529
I have for you...

04:28.320 --> 04:30.243
You need to keep it warm when you...

04:30.400 --> 04:33.131
So just put it next to your body,
underneath your shirt,

04:33.240 --> 04:35.971
- and you can come right over.
- Okay.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.921
So when do you want to do this?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.885
March 23rd.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.202
- I just want to build up some more savings.
- Please. That's smart.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.331
I already have health insurance
and everything.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.524
So I guess the question is,

04:59.040 --> 05:01.930
how much involvement do you want to have?

05:03.000 --> 05:08.450
I was going to suggest none,
but I'm open to negotiation.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.970
None is so cool.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.081
Yeah.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.121
I mean, that kind of takes
the pressure off, right? Doesn't it?

05:19.280 --> 05:21.931
I can just relax and build my empire.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.241
Oh, my gosh.

05:41.240 --> 05:45.370
Hi, Beverly. I got two checks this month.
Not that I'm complaining.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.044
You're sure
they're not for two different payments?

05:47.120 --> 05:48.849
Well, I'd love to think that,

05:48.920 --> 05:52.083
but they have the same date on them
and I was paid last month.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.571
- So anyway...
- Excuse me.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.529
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but overhear.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.127
This young woman got two checks,
and I don't have any.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.123
- What's your name?
- John Harding.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.486
Well, my name is Johanna Hardin.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.324
No, I mean, my name is Maggie,

06:04.400 --> 06:07.882
but on my checks,
it's Johanna Margaret Hardin.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.450
- Right.
- So maybe there was a mix-up.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.603
Yep. And it's gonna take a minute
to figure this out.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.251
You know, it would be great
if it could be resolved soon.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.325
We'll get back to you.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.201
Damn. That woman could guard hell
if Cerberus ever needs to go to the vet.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.806
Everyone's scared of Beverly.
What do you teach?

06:23.920 --> 06:27.163
Ficto-Critical Perspectives
in Family Dynamics.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.330
Yeah, and Masks in the Modern Family,
Victorian Times to the Present Day.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.488
- Psychology department?
- Anthropology.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.803
- I don't know any anthropologists.
- No? What about you?

06:37.160 --> 06:39.401
I'm the Director of Business Development
and Outreach

06:39.480 --> 06:41.528
for the art and design students.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.285
What is that?

06:43.360 --> 06:47.081
I help graduate students strategize
for success in the art and design world.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.288
I'm sort of a bridge
between art and commerce.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.044
You seem a little young for that, no?

06:51.160 --> 06:54.084
I have an MBA
and a master's in arts management.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.527
- Nice.
- Good luck getting paid!

06:58.360 --> 07:00.442
There is something satisfying
about the feeling.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.010
Yes. That is...

07:02.080 --> 07:03.411
Felicia.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.241
What time is that Pike Fellowship meeting?

07:06.360 --> 07:09.489
- Thursday at 7:00.
- All right. Great. Thanks.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.881
It's so funny you know John Harding.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.450
We're on a committee together.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.524
He's a real panty melter. Why?

07:21.680 --> 07:25.127
Nothing. We had a mix-up with our checks

07:25.200 --> 07:27.680
- because of our names. Hardin, Harding.
- Right.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.004
He's one of the bad boys
of ficto-critical anthropology.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.282
Apparently, he was a big deal in Chicago.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.850
And now, he just does adjunct work here,

07:34.920 --> 07:37.446
but they're really salivating for him
to work full-time.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.642
- Why won't he?
- I don't know.

07:39.720 --> 07:44.044
I think it has something to do with his wife.
Apparently, she's some sort of monster.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.566
- Where did you hear this?
- Around.

07:46.640 --> 07:51.601
You know, she's got tenure at Columbia.
Georgette NÃ¸rgaard.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.480
The words "glacial" and "terrifying"
have been bandied about.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.769
Then again, I have heard myself
described as a psychotic bitch,

07:58.840 --> 08:00.922
but I think I'm actually pretty nice.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.084
So you can't believe everything you hear.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.765
If you say, "She's, like, terrified,"

08:04.880 --> 08:07.121
it's not nearly as strong as saying,
"She's terrified."

08:07.200 --> 08:09.043
"Like" is a language condom.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.121
Trust me.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.767
Where the fuck is my chicken?

08:30.360 --> 08:31.441
Hardin!

08:31.680 --> 08:32.919
Hi!

08:34.919 --> 08:36.604
What are you doing?

08:36.679 --> 08:39.808
I'm just taking a little constitutional
before my next meeting.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.763
- Did you ever get paid?
- No.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.841
You're kidding.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.729
Yeah, Beverly says the check's in the mail.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.370
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

08:47.920 --> 08:53.165
I knew this Maasai from Tanzania.
He was here to run in a marathon.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.489
He took everything about New York City
in complete stride.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.040
Nothing fazed him
until he saw a grown man following his dog

08:59.120 --> 09:00.929
and picking up his shit.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.526
He started laughing so hard, he wept.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.650
I suppose that custom could seem strange,
like, out of context.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.330
What was that?

09:12.720 --> 09:17.647
I overheard your conversation
about how "like" is a language prophylactic.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.960
Yeah.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.961
What is ficto-critical
anthropology, anyway?

09:22.080 --> 09:25.527
Well, it is a way
of writing about anthropology

09:25.600 --> 09:28.331
that blends ethnographic observation,
storytelling,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.084
and, like, theory.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.925
Do we have to walk in the circle,
or can we walk around the park?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.490
We can walk.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.483
It's so hard to find a full-time position.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.968
My wife, Georgette,
has a tenured position at Columbia,

09:41.040 --> 09:44.601
so I'm just using the time
to teach a few classes

09:44.680 --> 09:48.401
and try to write this novel that
I've had in my head for the last few years.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.086
Are you getting a lot of work done
on the novel?

09:51.160 --> 09:53.891
They say every relationship
has a gardener and a rose.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.769
Georgette is definitely the rose.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.286
- And you're the gardener.
- And I don't have a green thumb.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.644
- Maybe you're a rose in disguise.
- It'd be a very good disguise.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.611
And, I mean, she's wonderful.
It's just she's kind of destroying my life.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.842
No, I mean,
this has been a bad week, and...

10:09.000 --> 10:10.286
Content with Hermia?

10:10.400 --> 10:12.368
- It's turning into a nice day.
- Yeah.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.523
I do repent of the tedious minutes
that I with her have spent.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.241
Not Hermia, but Helena I love.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.164
Who would not change a raven for a dove?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.326
Thanks, man.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.371
We have two of those.
It's the best part of my life.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.562
- Who's the guy?
- No guy.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.449
Well, actually,
the man I've asked to be the father

10:31.520 --> 10:34.251
is named "Guy," coincidentally.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.929
- You eat like Mr. Fox!
- Who?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.729
The Roald Dahl book. The movie.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.882
- My kids love that movie.
- Yeah.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.204
I really like what you're doing, though.
Having a baby by yourself.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.806
Not that it won't be hard
because it's gonna be fucking hard.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.242
But I admire your courage.
And I love babies.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.642
I just don't like leaving my destiny...

10:57.760 --> 10:59.171
- To destiny?
- Right.

10:59.240 --> 11:03.006
But where will I go?
You can't just kick me out of our house.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.287
- I have a question for you.
- Yeah.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.521
Would you read
the first chapter of my book?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.125
- Sure.
- I know that's weird.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.841
It's just... I really want
the first reader to be like...

11:15.920 --> 11:19.367
Well, you know how you said
you're a bridge between art and commerce?

11:19.440 --> 11:20.726
Well, I need a bridge.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.644
- Perfect. Give it to me. I'll read it.
- You will? I really would appreciate it.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.240
- I don't mind at all.
- All right. Okay.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.440
Okay, great. I'll read it tonight.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.401
Perfect.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.690
I gotta go. Shoot.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.366
Shit! Shit! Shit! I gotta go. I gotta go.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.921
- I'll see you later. Thank you.
- Okay, bye!

11:44.680 --> 11:48.969
What do you make of the use of masks
in the Occupy movement?

11:49.040 --> 11:53.011
The masked revolutionary is a direct
inversion of the face of the demagogue,

11:53.120 --> 11:57.603
the essentially fascist ideal
of the magnetic individual.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.006
Sorry I'm late.

11:59.200 --> 12:03.091
John Harding,
author of many books, including

12:03.920 --> 12:08.244
Rituals of Commodity Fetishism
at the Tail End of the Empire.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.125
So, John, of course, we've been
discussing the Occupy movement...

12:11.200 --> 12:12.565
I can't help mentioning the irony

12:12.640 --> 12:15.564
that Warner Bros. owns the copyright
on the V for Vendetta mask

12:15.640 --> 12:16.926
that became the face of
the Occupy movement...

12:17.000 --> 12:18.604
Whether we like it or not,

12:18.720 --> 12:22.486
in this country, the most potent,
totemic symbols that we have

12:22.560 --> 12:24.244
are cinematic and television-based.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.369
So it only makes sense
that a radical popular movement

12:27.480 --> 12:28.641
would try to subvert them...

12:28.720 --> 12:30.529
Nevertheless, the reality of Occupy occurs

12:30.600 --> 12:34.241
within the capitalist narrative
as a kind of subplot...

12:34.320 --> 12:36.846
This sweeping cynicism of yours...

12:36.920 --> 12:41.608
If by "sweeping cynicism,"
you mean not living in a dream,

12:41.680 --> 12:42.806
then shoot me now.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.406
Maybe the way we...

12:44.520 --> 12:46.329
Nobody ever thinks
a revolution is going to happen

12:46.400 --> 12:48.243
until three days after it's happened.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.723
This is a leaderless movement.
It wasn't gonna operate on a schedule.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.451
This was a genuine populist uprising.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.806
- Yes, because...
- Absolutely.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.605
But to return to the use
of masks in politics.

12:59.680 --> 13:04.288
I am more interested in the possibility
of anonymity and group affiliation.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.089
The "I am Spartacus" maneuver,

13:06.160 --> 13:08.083
which has been
the primary tactical explanation

13:08.160 --> 13:12.563
for the use of masks among various
20th and 21st century protest movements.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.006
Including the Zapatistas,

13:14.080 --> 13:16.765
the black blocs of
the anti-globalization movement,

13:16.960 --> 13:19.566
and, of course, Pussy Riot.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.006
Thank you.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.082
Look, you don't have to help,
but will you please put that down?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.850
One moment, okay?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.604
- See? Finished.
- Great.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.603
I don't get why
you have to say the same thing

13:32.680 --> 13:35.490
in the concluding paragraph
as you do in the introduction paragraph.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.201
You're explaining your thesis,
but in a more developed form.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.964
Okay. And what's the point of that?

13:41.040 --> 13:43.930
By the time you get to your conclusion,
you've proven your thesis.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.650
So it's basically just gloating.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.001
Yeah, it is basically just gloating.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.003
They have fleas in Paul's class again.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.481
They don't have fleas, okay? They have lice.
Let me check your head.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.165
Okay, lice.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.810
You don't have lice. Okay, go.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.405
No texting at table.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.841
- I wonder where she gets that from.
- I use my phone for work.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.605
Sometimes, I want to smash it
with a hammer.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.650
Way to go, Mom.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.121
Salad?

14:25.520 --> 14:26.885
What is it?

14:26.960 --> 14:29.440
They've asked me to chair
the department at Columbia!

14:29.560 --> 14:31.927
Congratulations. That's great.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.811
- It'll be a huge time commitment.
- Still, it's a high-class problem.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.445
When will I ever get my writing done?

14:36.560 --> 14:38.085
I've promised to deliver that book
by December.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.366
Come on. You'll get a big bump in salary.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.404
- All right. What are you...
- I'm already breaking out in a rash!

14:42.480 --> 14:45.484
I've got an idea. Why don't you call
Caleb back and discuss it?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.005
- I have to.
- I know. Fine.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.684
Justine, you want to text your friend.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.240
Paul, you want to play Ninja Revinja
on your iPad? Go.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.006
I myself even have a minor text
I would like to respond to.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.885
We can stop the pretense
of having a close-knit family dinner.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.571
And we can return to the bullshit later.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.324
What? What is it?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.490
The tone, it's so unusual.

15:05.640 --> 15:09.406
- It kind of screwball-surreal. Is that right?
- Yeah, that sounds right.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.245
Screwball-surreal. That's it exactly!

15:12.320 --> 15:13.970
And the characters.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.204
Like Martin Neems, the colorless
postal worker in 1950s Connecticut

15:18.280 --> 15:21.090
and he's married
to this insane Brazilian woman,

15:21.160 --> 15:23.766
who keeps breaking out in rashes.
It's hilarious.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.490
It is, right? Really, really?

15:25.560 --> 15:29.042
And the description
of the musical collection!

15:29.120 --> 15:32.249
- Yeah, with his records, you mean?
- Yes. It's so great.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.890
- That's funny, right?
- It's great.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.440
I am so sorry. I am very, very cold.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.443
- I feel like I'm welded to the bench.
- I know.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.931
Is it okay if we go get some coffee?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.281
Actually, my apartment is
like three blocks from here.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.284
- Whatever. Yeah, yeah. Come on.
- I just need to get another sweater.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.681
I'm just... I'm deathly cold.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.485
I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate you doing this.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.369
Really, it was so much fun to read.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.487
- Really?
- Yes.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.688
Did you think the boil was weird gross
or weird funny?

16:02.840 --> 16:04.046
I sublet from a poet.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.729
Do you want some hot tea?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.610
Or, I guess that's his wine, or...

16:09.720 --> 16:13.042
But I have whiskey.
It's a little early, but...

16:14.800 --> 16:17.963
We could make a hot whiskey.
Do you have some honey and lemon?

16:18.080 --> 16:20.811
Yes. I have... Let's see.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.281
I have a half a lemon and honey.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.721
- Well, I'll make it for you.
- Okay. Great.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.281
Thanks.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.925
You're clearly a reader.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.571
Actually, most of these books are his.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.242
- Hot whiskey.
- Thank you.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.808
It's so good.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.049
So tell me.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.727
You know, I'm curious about you.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.283
What about me? What aspect of me?

16:58.760 --> 17:00.683
Every aspect of you.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.527
I don't know where to start.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.204
How about the beginning?

17:07.280 --> 17:08.884
- I'm hot.
- I know.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.040
I'm gonna take...

17:10.160 --> 17:12.527
Well, I had a kind of unusual start.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.089
Yes?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.288
So my parents

17:16.400 --> 17:19.688
were married fairly young
and they never had kids.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.965
They were academics
at the University of Wisconsin.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.568
But then eventually, they got divorced
and my dad moved away.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.964
But then later, years later,
they ran into each other at a party.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.680
And they...

17:34.560 --> 17:36.528
They got together that night.

17:36.600 --> 17:41.447
And that's how I was conceived.
On the bed with all the coats.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.328
My mom always says that
it's because I needed to be born.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.481
I love that idea.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.962
That our unborn children are the real gods

17:51.640 --> 17:56.089
dictating the fates of us
poor clueless mortals.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.329
And did they...
They got together after that?

18:00.400 --> 18:03.882
No. My mom raised me alone in Madison.

18:06.560 --> 18:10.167
She was a professor of
19th century British poetry.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.330
She wasn't very practical.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.165
So I ended up doing
all the day-to-day stuff.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.204
I was organizing all of her bills
by the time I was 12.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.569
She came from a Quaker family,

18:21.640 --> 18:25.087
so she used to take me to Quaker meetings
with her.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.322
And I still go, sometimes.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.447
A Quaker, huh?

18:32.640 --> 18:36.531
Yeah, we had a nice life.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.929
And then when I was 16,

18:42.880 --> 18:44.291
she died.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.164
So...

18:48.560 --> 18:53.043
I went to go live with my dad in Philly.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.650
How was that?

18:56.840 --> 18:58.444
It was cordial.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.251
And quiet.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.847
- Lonely?
- Yes.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.881
I grew up in a house where nobody
ever stopped yelling at each other.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.721
Heaven.

19:15.200 --> 19:20.081
No, my dad is a kind man.
And he made the best of the situation.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.611
We both did.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.488
So what about you? Tell me about you.
Background-wise.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.931
Background.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.731
My father was a black jack dealer
in Atlantic City.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.930
But it's a really long story. And I really...
I have to get back to my dysfunction.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.046
- I believe it.
- What?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.568
That you had to be born.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.283
Martin Neem dreamed
the same thing every night.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.811
But he could never remember what it was.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.691
His wife, Talia, slept like a stone.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.369
Talia was a small woman.

20:09.440 --> 20:13.365
A small, beautiful woman
with hair like a river of snakes,

20:13.480 --> 20:15.244
and the temper of an angry mink.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.726
- Hi!
- Hey.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.325
- Did you get to the static thing yet?
- Yes.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.323
- Did that make you laugh?
- I have no friction at all.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.723
- Yeah, but it made you laugh, right?
- It did make me laugh.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.246
He can't stop eating.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.891
He's like this really gross eater.
You know what I mean?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.691
And he's saying these brilliant things
about how he's got stuff in his beard.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.807
Right. Beard.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.611
- So that when they kiss, you know...
- Gross! Oh, no.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.001
Right, I know! That's what you'd think.
Except, she loves it.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.283
Did you think that this was overwritten?

20:39.360 --> 20:41.442
I think his book is a novella.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.286
It's short and very strange.
It might even be, like, an allegory.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.409
I like everything I've read.
He's asking me for suggestions.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.164
What does his wife think about that?

20:50.240 --> 20:51.844
She doesn't know about it.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.003
To be honest, I don't think
she really pays attention to what he does.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.924
She's very self-absorbed.
She might even be a narcissist.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.161
Of course, she is.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.163
Why of course?

21:01.280 --> 21:03.248
He's basically a psychiatric nurse.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.642
He can't write his novel
under those conditions.

21:06.720 --> 21:09.564
I think their marriage, like,
fell apart after the second child.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.211
- And now he's trapped in it.
- That's what he's telling you.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.441
Why would he lie?

21:13.520 --> 21:15.329
To get into your pants!

21:17.200 --> 21:18.201
Hello!

21:19.560 --> 21:20.607
Hi.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.731
Thank you. I'll just...

21:40.400 --> 21:41.731
Did you bring it?

21:43.840 --> 21:44.841
Fuck!

21:44.920 --> 21:47.890
- That's why I gave you that little container.
- Where's your bathroom?

21:51.560 --> 21:54.723
So where do I deposit
my genetic goldmine into?

22:02.280 --> 22:03.725
It's sterile.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.486
Listen.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.770
I feel it behooves me to offer
to do this the old-fashioned way.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.922
Considering your extreme state of beauty

22:21.760 --> 22:23.489
and my totally free afternoon.

22:26.400 --> 22:30.200
No. No, thank you, Guy.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.605
I just think
it would be too complicated, you know.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.604
Just being polite.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.728
Should I go out for a bit?

22:40.080 --> 22:43.641
No. Just read something.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.046
I'll be back in a jiff with that jizz.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.008
- Hey, Guy?
- Yes?

22:51.080 --> 22:53.447
Why didn't you become a mathematician?

22:53.520 --> 22:56.524
I liked math
because it was beautiful, that's all.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.121
I never wanted to be a mathematician.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.965
Really? You think math is beautiful?

23:03.040 --> 23:07.329
Anyone who's touched even a hem
of that garment knows it's beautiful.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.444
For me, the hem was enough.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.640
Couldn't have taken the frustration.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.961
What do you mean?

23:17.080 --> 23:19.287
Never seeing the whole thing.

23:19.880 --> 23:24.090
You're always just getting
these little glimpses of the whole picture.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.642
Spending my whole life
hunting for scraps of truth.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.726
Swift.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.890
When there's an actual lady involved,

24:23.920 --> 24:25.490
it's a different story.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.409
I made you extra
just in case you spill some.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.481
Thanks.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.651
Thank you, Guy. This is really...

24:35.400 --> 24:37.448
This is really great.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.521
Super.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.405
I just...

24:45.600 --> 24:46.806
A selfie.

24:49.680 --> 24:54.607
You have a 71% chance of being fertile.

25:04.960 --> 25:09.170
Hi! My apps are giving me contradictory
information. Maybe I should wait.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.767
- Yeah, you should wait for like, five years.
- Don't listen to him.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.001
He's losing his mind.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.084
- He seems to be a little on edge.
- You think so?

25:17.200 --> 25:20.329
Yeah, he's driving me crazy
with theories about mental illness

25:20.400 --> 25:22.050
in Guy Childers' family.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.124
No, I met his mother once.
She had a face like a hatchet.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.601
And she wouldn't stop sighing.
And she drank!

25:28.080 --> 25:30.481
Did you get that? Personally,
I think he just loves you too much.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.686
He wants to keep you for himself.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.042
Stop it. You know that's not true.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.442
Well, I think he doesn't want you to move on
with this next phase of your life

25:37.520 --> 25:40.524
because then he, too,
might actually have to grow up.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.041
Shut the fuck up. Shut your mouth.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.885
How elevated
does your temperature have to be?

25:46.960 --> 25:48.883
I don't know I think slightly elevated?

25:48.960 --> 25:53.124
101! You talking about the temperature?
It has to be 101 degrees!

25:53.200 --> 25:55.362
When was the last time you ovulated?

25:55.480 --> 25:57.642
- I read about it.
- I heard it doesn't always work the first time.

25:57.760 --> 26:02.163
- My girlfriend Odette... Did you ever...
- Wait! Hold on! Hold on. Wait.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.446
- That woman is nuts!
- You have a problem with her

26:03.520 --> 26:04.521
because she's a performance artist!

26:04.600 --> 26:05.601
Bye!

26:05.720 --> 26:10.567
You had her speak at Max's class and
she said the word "my vagina" three times.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.607
I'm coming!

26:11.680 --> 26:14.604
- Maggie, have you done it yet?
- Have you done it yet?

26:15.080 --> 26:16.241
Hang on.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.728
- Hello?
- Hey, it's John.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.241
Shoot!

26:25.440 --> 26:27.681
Wait there! Okay, you have to wait.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.207
John? Are you still there?

26:55.800 --> 26:57.370
Hey. Are you okay?

27:00.400 --> 27:03.290
Yeah. No. I got locked out.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.526
I mean... And Georgette and the kids are...

27:07.160 --> 27:09.083
Pennsylvania, you know. I mean...

27:11.040 --> 27:13.566
Do you want to stay on the couch?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.001
Not really.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.651
So I'm on chapter five,

27:23.720 --> 27:28.362
and now I think
Mrs. Jeffries is my favorite character.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.602
She's so pallid and reliable,

27:30.680 --> 27:34.401
but he finds her so attractive
in spite of her mustache.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.768
I was just... Actually, I was wondering

27:39.640 --> 27:43.486
if the wife's behavior
is getting a little large?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.367
You should try coming over to our house.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.410
The book's like a documentary, you know?
I mean, no... I don't...

27:50.520 --> 27:53.410
I don't know. I'm sure you're right.
I'm sure I'm exaggerating her behavior.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.007
No, no! It's, like, really funny.
So I don't want you to change it.

27:57.080 --> 28:00.527
Maybe it's just more about, like,
how much of it you do.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.206
- Like, you don't want it to be...
- Fuck it!

28:09.320 --> 28:10.606
I'm in love with you.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.487
I mean, I'm genuinely
locked out of my apartment. I am.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.722
But I'm also in love with you.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.209
And I don't want to be married
to Georgette anymore.

28:22.280 --> 28:25.727
And please... Please can I...

28:25.800 --> 28:27.928
Can I sleep in your bed?

28:52.160 --> 28:54.811
I don't want you to have a baby
with the pickle man.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.528
I want you to have a baby with me.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.488
- I need to tell you something.
- What?

29:03.800 --> 29:07.247
I tried... I tried already.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.201
When?

29:10.320 --> 29:11.446
Recently.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.562
- What happened?
- It didn't work! It didn't work.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.961
- I just had to tell you because...
- Because why?

29:18.400 --> 29:21.847
Because I love you. I'm in love with you.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.765
You want to put them in?

30:14.680 --> 30:19.049
Okay, here. Hold them. Hold all of them.
You got it? Now put it in.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.807
Goodbye.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.446
What about... Try mine again. See.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.607
- Cold.
- Cold. It's a cold one.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.521
Daddy!

30:53.280 --> 30:55.123
Hey! What happened to my music?

30:55.600 --> 30:59.366
- It was so loud!
- Yeah, well, you know, that's the idea.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.247
Shall I go turn it back up?

31:02.320 --> 31:06.245
- You really are from Wisconsin, aren't you?
- I am.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.771
Do you think
you could watch her for an hour?

31:11.840 --> 31:13.410
I have a conference call.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.522
Well, I was gonna write some more, but...
You done with this?

31:17.600 --> 31:19.728
But, no, I can watch her. I can watch her.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.564
- Thank you.
- You put too...

31:21.640 --> 31:23.483
- Can I bring Froggy?
- Yeah, bring Froggy, bring Froggy.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.601
We got Froggy.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.568
So what do you want to do?
You want to make a mess?

31:29.640 --> 31:30.801
- Yeah.
- Yeah, me, too.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.769
Yes. The last time we spoke,

31:32.840 --> 31:36.401
you had wanted to do something
with skateboarding and architecture.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.811
Is that still what you're thinking?

31:37.880 --> 31:41.089
Absolutely I want to be
a fragile little human

31:41.160 --> 31:44.084
scaling some big architectural monolith.

31:44.160 --> 31:48.643
Yeah, like skateboarding
down the ramp of the Guggenheim.

31:49.160 --> 31:54.041
- Yes! Exactly, That's perfect.
- But I didn't mean the actual Guggenheim.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.087
Why not?

31:55.160 --> 31:56.400
- Hello?
- Mommy!

31:56.480 --> 31:58.164
One second. John?

31:58.640 --> 32:00.324
Froggy is drowning!

32:00.480 --> 32:01.527
John?

32:01.640 --> 32:03.563
Froggy is drowning, Mommy!

32:03.640 --> 32:04.766
Hold on a second.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.605
Hi. Sorry about this,
but I have another urgent call.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.603
I'll be right back on. One second.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.087
- Mommy!
- I'm just glad that the...

32:13.480 --> 32:14.481
Okay, no...

32:14.560 --> 32:17.928
- Froggy fell in and then he was hungry.
- Rats. We'll get this.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.521
Goodness! You've made a big mess.
What's this?

32:22.600 --> 32:24.045
We're gonna save him!

32:25.280 --> 32:30.127
- Can I wash him, Mommy?
- Yeah, let's go wash him. Here, I'm gonna...

32:30.200 --> 32:31.804
I wanna wash him.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.965
See, we saved him!
We gotta figure out how to clean all that up.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.964
But first, I'm gonna see if this...

32:39.800 --> 32:42.121
Hello? Hello?

32:44.200 --> 32:46.771
- Did you take care of Froggy?
- Yeah, but why didn't you?

32:46.840 --> 32:49.491
The guys from Parallel Press called.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.450
- Great! What'd they say?
- They said they want to meet me at 4:00.

32:52.520 --> 32:55.091
But you said that
you were gonna watch Lily this afternoon

32:55.200 --> 32:57.009
because I had a meeting with a student?

32:57.120 --> 32:58.121
Right.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.881
Maybe I could push it.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.490
But who's gonna pick up Paul and Justine?

33:05.560 --> 33:06.766
- Fuck. All right.
- No!

33:06.880 --> 33:08.120
I'll reschedule my meeting.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.201
- You don't mind?
- No.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.281
- Really?
- Yes.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.442
All right. All right. Thanks.

33:14.840 --> 33:17.241
Hello. He what?

33:18.240 --> 33:21.210
All right. Yeah, yeah.
Hold on. Hey, Maggie.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.643
Paul twisted his ankle in eurhythmics.
Can you go pick him up?

33:24.720 --> 33:25.767
Now?

33:27.160 --> 33:29.208
- Okay...
- Where's Dad?

33:29.880 --> 33:34.283
He had a meeting, sweetie.
Does it hurt a lot?

33:35.800 --> 33:41.091
We have a while before Justine gets out.
All right. Here, let me just get...

33:41.160 --> 33:43.447
Let me just get Lily in.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.443
Okay. Good job.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.326
Okay.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.491
Doing a dance! I have been...

33:57.920 --> 33:58.921
Great.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.921
Hello? Hi! Great.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.924
Thanks for returning my call.
Just one second, sorry.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.161
- Hey, Paul! Paul.
- Yeah?

34:06.240 --> 34:08.083
Why don't you go check
and see what's taking Justine so long?

34:08.159 --> 34:09.730
- Okay!
- Okay. Great.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.962
Hi! Thanks for waiting.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.371
Yes, so I was hoping to schedule a meeting

34:16.800 --> 34:18.404
for one of our grad students.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.880
Komiko Krauss.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.246
And she has just patented a toy

34:22.320 --> 34:25.051
and we would love a chance
to present it to you guys.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.563
Great! Yes! Okay.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.969
Great. Fine. Thank you.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.884
- Hi!
- Hi!

34:34.000 --> 34:38.210
- Got caught up in the locker room?
- Yeah, I couldn't find my shoes.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.081
Well, we're all here now.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.161
What's for dinner?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.850
That's a good question.

34:42.920 --> 34:46.003
I'll pick something up.
Your dad's in a meeting.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.809
Okay. When's Mom coming home?

34:48.679 --> 34:51.001
I don't know, but I bet there's a plan!

34:51.920 --> 34:52.920
Yeah.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.125
Here we go!

34:56.159 --> 34:57.286
Georgette...

34:57.840 --> 35:02.687
Georgette, the advance is only $5,000 more.
Just go to the house with a better editor.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.922
Okay, no...
Now you're talking yourself in circles.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.970
Munroe is the right editor for this book.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.321
No...

35:12.520 --> 35:14.443
For all the reasons
we've been talking about!

35:20.560 --> 35:25.122
So how was
your meeting with Parallel Press?

35:25.200 --> 35:30.206
Yeah. It got pushed till Thursday.
Georgette had another one of her crises.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.681
I couldn't get her off the phone!

35:32.760 --> 35:34.762
What happened?

35:34.840 --> 35:39.607
Well, she has two different offers
from UK publishers and she couldn't decide.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.246
She doesn't have anyone else
to talk to about something like this

35:44.320 --> 35:46.209
- except for her ex-husband?
- Come on.

35:46.280 --> 35:51.320
Especially since her new book is all
about our affair and how it ruined her life.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.085
Okay, look. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I messed up your day, okay?

35:54.160 --> 35:56.083
It's not just my day. It's my student.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.721
Komiko. She's a fragile person.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.883
And I had set up a meeting with her

36:03.960 --> 36:06.611
to discuss the potential meeting
with the toy company.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.331
But I had to cancel that meeting
because you had a meeting,

36:09.400 --> 36:11.801
and then you didn't even go
to your meeting with the publisher

36:11.880 --> 36:14.486
because you were talking Georgette
out of her tree!

36:14.560 --> 36:18.121
And why does nobody ever
talk me out of my tree?

36:18.200 --> 36:20.089
'Cause you're never up a tree, hon.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.766
Come on.
If you did, you'd get down all by yourself.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.490
Am I so capable

36:26.560 --> 36:29.484
that I don't deserve
any attention, is that it?

36:30.800 --> 36:35.283
The squeaky wheel gets the grease,
and the cactus never gets water?

36:35.640 --> 36:37.210
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

36:37.280 --> 36:41.808
You need to start thinking of yourself
as indispensable.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.123
Okay, first of all, I'm not.
I'm totally dispensable.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.771
I mean, on a practical level,
you'd be fine without me.

36:47.840 --> 36:50.047
Do you realize
that Paul faked the ankle thing today

36:50.120 --> 36:51.565
because he wanted you
to come pick him up at school

36:51.640 --> 36:52.641
and then you didn't even show?

36:52.800 --> 36:54.040
What do you mean?

36:54.240 --> 36:57.961
He ran on it when I asked him
to go check on Justine. He forgot.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.088
- Well, that's weird.
- No, it's not weird.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.050
You want to know why?
Because his mother is in Reykjavik right now

37:04.120 --> 37:07.044
studying the maternal techniques
of the Icelandic.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.968
He needs his father's attention.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.451
So do I.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.726
Let's go away together, just us.
As soon as Georgette gets back.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.161
Please?

37:24.840 --> 37:26.808
I'm gonna start pouting more.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.487
Georgette'll give you a tutorial.
She's good at that.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.687
Who did you sit with at snack?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.602
- Allison.
- Maggie?

37:43.800 --> 37:46.087
Hi! Hi, Guy!

37:46.200 --> 37:48.646
Hi. This is my friend Guy.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.967
Is that...

37:52.040 --> 37:54.407
No! No! This is Lily. I got married.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.444
I should have told you.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.525
I met my husband around the same time
that you gave me the sample.

38:05.120 --> 38:08.283
- How are you?
- Intense. Intense.

38:08.560 --> 38:12.804
I just heard that Whole Foods are gonna be
carrying my pickles nationally, so...

38:12.880 --> 38:15.565
Yeah, we'll have to expand production
post haste!

38:15.640 --> 38:16.641
That's amazing.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.643
So I'm just manning the stall.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.485
Get away from the chaos at the factory.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.609
Well... Do you still have
those Bavarian pickles?

38:24.680 --> 38:28.002
Sure do. They're our most popular pickle.

38:28.080 --> 38:31.482
- Well, let's get a... Can I buy a jar?
- Yes!

38:31.560 --> 38:33.688
When are we gonna eat the pickles?

38:33.760 --> 38:35.762
Let's go get some pickles.
Let's see what they are.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.525
Sounds good. Oh, my goodness.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.689
That's the biggest jar of pickles
I've ever seen.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.569
How much do I owe you?

38:43.720 --> 38:46.405
- It's a wedding present.
- Thank you.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.090
- Bye! Okay, let's go.
- Bye, Lily!

38:50.160 --> 38:51.889
We're gonna take our pickle baby home.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.001
I am so glad you're you.

38:55.080 --> 38:58.163
I am so glad you're you, wiglet. Bye!

38:58.760 --> 38:59.841
Bye.

39:06.760 --> 39:07.761
Still warm.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.723
Hey, Georgette canceled her trip.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.122
So she's gonna want the kids next week
after all.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.123
I'm Mrs. Jeffries, aren't I?

39:24.720 --> 39:29.248
I'm the colorless, efficient postal worker
that you fall in love with

39:29.320 --> 39:32.210
because she makes your life so much easier.

39:32.280 --> 39:35.887
I came up with Mrs. Jeffries
before we even met.

39:35.960 --> 39:39.487
Yeah, well, you've turned me
into her, then.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.288
At least I don't have a mustache.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.121
Yet.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.767
Do you want to hear your horoscope?

39:53.920 --> 39:54.967
No.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.169
I'm terrified that I'm falling
out of love with him.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.607
Like, really out of love.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.406
Felicia and I fall in and out of love
pretty much every week.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.050
You can't be so idealistic.

40:08.120 --> 40:12.569
I wanted to help him become a fiction writer,
and now all he does is write,

40:12.680 --> 40:16.651
and the novel is 500 pages long
and I don't even think it's half done.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.166
- Have you read the whole thing?
- Most of it.

40:19.240 --> 40:20.366
You still like it?

40:21.520 --> 40:23.966
- It's gotten more and more complicated.
- Yeah.

40:24.040 --> 40:28.443
Do you think it's possible to be too smart
to be a novelist?

40:28.520 --> 40:30.443
I haven't heard that one.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.601
Do you think
there's something wrong with me?

40:31.680 --> 40:32.681
Wrong with you?

40:32.760 --> 40:36.685
Yeah, that I have a condition
where I always fall out of love.

40:38.080 --> 40:39.445
Maybe.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.010
Shut up!

40:41.080 --> 40:43.447
- What? Yes! No!
- Really? You think I have a condition?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.249
No! Yes! I don't know! I don't know.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.926
Maybe! No, no, you don't. You know what?

40:48.040 --> 40:51.203
Maybe you just haven't met the right guy yet.
Ask Felicia. Don't ask me.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.805
I'm not the right guy.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.083
Does he ever walk?

40:55.160 --> 40:58.801
Max? He's gotta finish that book by Friday.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.884
Does he ever walk? Yes.
He's the captain of the soccer team.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.203
- What is it? Stroller soccer?
- You're hilarious.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.851
I will be honest with you.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.731
This book was born from pain.

41:14.800 --> 41:19.886
My husband, whom I am not ashamed to say
I loved with all my heart,

41:20.160 --> 41:22.083
though we had a difficult relationship,

41:23.520 --> 41:27.764
had an affair with a younger woman,
left me and started a new family.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.884
And what I gleaned
from this exquisite torture

41:31.960 --> 41:35.407
are the thoughts
which this act of betrayal to me as a woman

41:35.480 --> 41:38.131
provoked in me as an anthropologist.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.725
I must ask myself,

41:39.800 --> 41:44.044
is the contemporary obsession
with exclusive possession

41:44.120 --> 41:47.602
ruining our chances of marital happiness?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.570
Excuse me.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.926
Maggie?

41:51.760 --> 41:53.091
Yes! Hi.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.090
I recognized you
from a picture on Justine's phone.

41:59.440 --> 42:04.241
I wanted to... I wanted to see your reading.
It was really...

42:06.360 --> 42:09.762
I want to say thank you for taking such
good care of the children while I was gone.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.360
I know it's been a burden. I appreciate it.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.046
You're welcome. They're wonderful kids.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.808
We should get together sometime.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.802
I feel I've been rather
childish about all this.

42:23.560 --> 42:28.168
We have to face the fact that we are
raising them together, the three of us, yeah.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.405
I would love that.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.124
Call me some time.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.804
It's easy to get my number.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.567
- You bought a book?
- I couldn't resist.

42:45.640 --> 42:49.440
- Do we need to get it signed?
- I think we do.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.521
- Georgette is fascinating.
- Really?

42:54.600 --> 42:59.527
Yes. She's warm and powerful

42:59.600 --> 43:05.164
and charming all at once and
I can see why he was so obsessed with her.

43:05.240 --> 43:08.005
I don't think "easy to live with"
was on that list, though, you know.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.681
I like her.

43:11.320 --> 43:14.802
I actually like her! I'm such a blockhead.

43:15.160 --> 43:19.210
I thought I was rescuing John
from this monstrous egomaniac,

43:19.280 --> 43:21.009
so he could finally finish his book.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.926
I thought I knew better how to run his life,
that I was gonna fix everything.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.889
And he's totally self-absorbed,

43:27.000 --> 43:31.289
while I do every single practical thing
and make the money, and on top of that...

43:32.160 --> 43:35.846
If it weren't for Lily,
I would say I made a terrible mistake.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.802
It's too bad you can't give him back
to his ex-wife. Right?

43:49.320 --> 43:50.560
I hate brussel sprouts.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.051
They're a little hard.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.006
So now it suits the captors
to have the little prisoners moved.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.764
Aren't you excited to see Mama?

44:33.160 --> 44:35.128
Of course, I'm excited to see Mama.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.931
I'm just sick of never knowing
where any of my stuff is.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.527
I can't wait until I have kids
so I can push them around.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.165
Sometimes I wonder
if she is a little dim-witted.

44:47.240 --> 44:48.651
What is she doing?

44:48.720 --> 44:49.721
She's nice.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.524
You're like a dog.
You love whoever feeds you.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.442
Not true.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.443
I'm sorry. Is there a problem here?

44:57.280 --> 44:59.009
No. I just can't believe

44:59.080 --> 45:01.845
that I found a legal parking spot
right in front of your mom's house.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.924
- You're coming inside?
- Just to say hi.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.286
Okay.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.131
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.841
Hi!

45:15.280 --> 45:16.645
Hello, Maggie.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.564
Hi. John had a meeting,
so he asked me to drop them off.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.369
- Come in.
- Thanks.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.523
Now, I have made you a nice snack.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.125
And you are allowed to watch

45:27.200 --> 45:30.170
one single episode of something ghastly
while eating it.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.969
The snacks are already in the den.

45:32.080 --> 45:34.242
- And no fighting about what it is, Paul.
- Okay.

45:37.440 --> 45:41.809
- I was about to make some coffee? Or tea?
- Coffee would be great.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.969
Your place is really nice.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.005
Columbia housing.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.683
I put butter in mine.

45:48.760 --> 45:52.128
- Nullifies the afternoon sugar cravings.
- Great.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.201
- Lovely photo.
- Yes.

46:24.480 --> 46:25.481
Thank you.

46:34.520 --> 46:36.363
It's so good to finally meet you.

46:36.480 --> 46:38.801
I won't pretend
it doesn't cost me something.

46:38.880 --> 46:39.961
Of course.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.202
- I'm not into fakery.
- Me neither.

46:42.480 --> 46:46.451
I detest the role of the spurned wife.
I won't play it.

46:46.520 --> 46:48.522
- You're not.
- Am I not?

46:48.760 --> 46:54.483
No. You still have
such a deep connection to John.

46:54.560 --> 46:57.723
We have managed
to remain friends, it's true.

46:58.520 --> 47:02.445
- Well, and your phone calls.
- Do you disapprove of them?

47:02.520 --> 47:03.646
No.

47:03.720 --> 47:07.406
The marriage has dissolved,
but we are still parenting together.

47:08.560 --> 47:13.248
Well, I mean, it's not just parenting.

47:13.320 --> 47:16.847
You guys are on the phone,
like, several times a day.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.002
Don't get me wrong. I think it's great.

47:19.080 --> 47:20.923
So I...

47:23.360 --> 47:24.600
It's just...

47:26.600 --> 47:27.840
Yes?

47:29.240 --> 47:31.766
Well, it's obvious
that you're still in love with him.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.129
What the hell are you playing at?

47:34.640 --> 47:36.608
John and I are in trouble.

47:36.680 --> 47:39.251
And I don't think he realizes
how much trouble we're in,

47:39.320 --> 47:41.084
or he doesn't want to know.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.811
And then, when I saw you at the reading,

47:43.920 --> 47:47.527
I realized that
there might be an opportunity,

47:47.600 --> 47:49.921
an opening to somehow

47:51.720 --> 47:54.246
get the two of you back together.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.402
I see. I see.

47:57.080 --> 48:00.687
So you are tired of your little affair?

48:00.760 --> 48:02.285
You're all done with it.

48:02.400 --> 48:05.131
Now you want to make sure
you don't feel guilty

48:05.200 --> 48:09.569
so you're going to manipulate us all
into some absurd happy ending.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.802
I have met a lot
of control freaks in my life,

48:11.880 --> 48:17.011
in fact, I thought I was one, but you,
you make me look like an amateur.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.565
I didn't mean to insult you.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.529
Have the decency to leave him

48:20.600 --> 48:24.400
and face the fact that you poisoned my life
and my children's life,

48:24.480 --> 48:27.006
and probably John's life
with your own selfishness.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.048
That's your burden. You earned it.

48:29.640 --> 48:30.766
Wait a minute.

48:30.840 --> 48:34.925
If you had such a perfect marriage,
why was John miserable?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.890
You neglected him and you used him
and you didn't believe in his talent.

48:37.960 --> 48:39.121
If I am so awful,

48:39.200 --> 48:41.009
why are you trying to get me back together
with him?

48:41.080 --> 48:42.684
Because I think that, actually,

48:42.760 --> 48:46.765
even though I do think you are
pretty self-absorbed and extremely needy,

48:46.840 --> 48:49.286
that he needs it. It keeps him in balance.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.523
It's thinking about you that stops him
from only thinking about himself.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.171
Leave. Leave. Leave.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.924
- Leave? You want me to leave.
- Leave my house, leave.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.570
- Okay, I'm leaving. Okay, sorry.
- Leave, leave.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.206
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.084
I am in such deep oatmeal.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.120
What was I thinking?

49:15.200 --> 49:18.682
- Maybe you're having a psychotic episode.
- But it was such a good idea.

49:18.760 --> 49:20.888
You know, life doesn't work this way,
you dufus.

49:20.960 --> 49:23.850
You can't take everything
and stuff it back in the box.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.405
God, I think you need some help.

49:26.480 --> 49:29.643
- Why are you being so hostile?
- Because it pisses me off!

49:29.720 --> 49:32.485
- The whole thing pisses me off.
- Why?

49:32.560 --> 49:35.689
Why can't you just leave your husband
like any normal human being?

49:35.760 --> 49:37.762
- Because it would be such a waste.
- A waste!

49:37.840 --> 49:41.811
You are such a hall monitor. It's not
a waste. He's not a paper product.

49:41.880 --> 49:47.011
Love is messy. It's illogical,
it's wasteful and it's messy.

49:47.080 --> 49:50.687
And it leaves these loose threads
that go out all over the place.

49:50.800 --> 49:55.328
But you, you like things nice and neat
and tidy and ethical.

49:55.400 --> 49:58.006
But you screwed that up
the minute you got with a married man.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.368
You're not being my friend right now.

50:00.440 --> 50:02.522
Yes, I am. I am being your friend.
This is being your friend.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.601
I'm being honest with you.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.727
Good intentions.
You're all about good intentions.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.202
Little Miss Quaker Two Shoes
is gonna do the right thing.

50:09.280 --> 50:12.363
But you always somehow screw it up.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.921
- Screw you.
- Yeah, screw me. Fine.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.927
Just being honest. Trying to be a friend.

50:19.440 --> 50:22.967
Don't come over here and...
How do crayons...

50:29.000 --> 50:32.641
Hey, Maggie. Hey, I'm sorry.
Hey, hey, Maggie.

50:34.200 --> 50:37.522
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay?

50:38.400 --> 50:42.325
I mean, what about Lily, huh?

50:42.400 --> 50:44.129
Fathers are a good thing, too.

50:44.560 --> 50:47.643
I know that. I know that,

50:47.720 --> 50:52.965
but I'm just as afraid of her growing up
inside of a dead marriage

50:53.040 --> 50:56.283
as her growing up
in a house without her dad.

50:58.480 --> 51:01.290
Kids can tell when people are pretending.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.083
I don't know. It's a tough one.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.851
I'm sorry.

51:12.480 --> 51:14.608
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:15.680 --> 51:18.081
Okay, okay, okay.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.161
Okay.

51:38.560 --> 51:41.643
- Yes, please.
- Yes please, what?

51:42.200 --> 51:44.851
Yes, please, I'd like to do something.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.843
Just us. If the offer's still good.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.369
Do you have anything in mind?

51:53.080 --> 51:56.687
I don't know. Maybe a local adventure.

52:04.320 --> 52:07.164
Hi. My name is Johnny Harding.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.607
And I was hoping to talk to Wang.
Is he downstairs?

52:17.320 --> 52:18.321
Stay there.

52:20.440 --> 52:24.161
Hey, hey! Johnny Harding. Yeah, thanks.
Come on.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.526
My dad used to take me
to the owner's old place.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.721
Sorry.

52:56.360 --> 52:57.566
What's in that?

52:57.640 --> 52:59.369
Just drink it, okay?

52:59.440 --> 53:01.124
This is for all the marbles.

53:02.280 --> 53:04.647
We won! We won!

53:07.920 --> 53:09.365
I should get you a pipe.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.122
Act like you know what you're doing.

53:16.080 --> 53:18.162
- Is it good?
- Yes.

53:18.240 --> 53:20.129
- Right?
- No.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.761
No! Please, no! Where did they go?

53:24.560 --> 53:26.403
Drown my sorrows.

53:26.480 --> 53:27.970
Slow down on that.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.321
And before... Thank you.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.045
Do you have a room for tonight?

53:33.960 --> 53:35.564
Is this a hotel?

53:35.640 --> 53:38.246
It is a hotel if you know it's a hotel.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.807
Thank you. What do I owe you?

53:42.880 --> 53:44.803
$50. I got $50.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.044
God! My God!

53:55.640 --> 53:57.404
Take off your clothes!

53:57.480 --> 54:00.051
- Five!
- Four!

54:00.120 --> 54:01.121
- Three!
- Three.

54:01.680 --> 54:03.967
- Two. One.
- Two. One.

54:15.600 --> 54:18.604
Take off your fucking tights!

54:42.800 --> 54:45.087
Would you ever want another baby?

54:45.160 --> 54:46.969
I'm just trying to finish this book.

54:47.040 --> 54:49.327
I think I'm gonna have to
knuckle down, you know.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.721
I mean, four kids would be a lot.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.326
What?

55:00.200 --> 55:03.807
I mean, you wouldn't even notice.
It's just one more kid for you to ignore.

55:06.240 --> 55:08.527
What kind of thing is that to say?

55:08.600 --> 55:11.729
It's a true thing. John.

55:13.280 --> 55:16.648
I mean, I support you
while you write this book.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.802
I get that. That's fine, I accept that.

55:18.880 --> 55:22.202
But I feel like your intern or your nanny.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.003
- Look, Maggie. For Christ's sakes...
- And you don't even...

55:25.080 --> 55:29.290
You set all this up, all right?
You gave us all a job. And I'm doing my job.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.010
My job is to write the book.
That's what I'm doing.

55:31.080 --> 55:32.411
- I know that's what you're doing.
- Yes!

55:32.480 --> 55:37.168
So you can't get mad when we all
just play our parts to perfection.

55:37.240 --> 55:39.561
Do you even like me anymore?

55:44.960 --> 55:48.009
What are you trying to get me to say, huh?

55:48.080 --> 55:51.527
It sounds like
I should be asking you that question.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.729
- You want me to get your bag?
- No. I got it, thanks.

56:17.120 --> 56:19.771
- May I sit?
- Yes.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.731
In December,
I am attending a conference in Canada

56:32.800 --> 56:34.962
on ficto-critical anthropology.

56:39.160 --> 56:42.164
Ficto-critical anthropology
is John's field.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.651
I know.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.166
I'm in.

56:48.480 --> 56:51.245
- Really?
- I have no reason to trust you.

56:52.600 --> 56:57.288
On the other hand,
I have absolutely nothing to lose.

56:57.360 --> 57:00.842
I could easily arrange to have John
give a paper at the conference.

57:02.200 --> 57:03.611
Do you think he would accept?

57:03.960 --> 57:07.123
Å½iÅ¾ek is speaking. He loves Å½iÅ¾ek.

57:09.760 --> 57:13.128
They invited me
to give a paper at a conference.

57:13.880 --> 57:15.405
Really? That's great!

57:15.480 --> 57:18.290
Yeah, except it's all the way up in Quebec.
So I can't go.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.727
- No, you have to go!
- Why?

57:22.200 --> 57:26.250
Because I think
you could really use a break.

57:28.080 --> 57:30.447
Yeah, well...

57:31.920 --> 57:34.287
Georgette's out of town that week, too,
you know.

57:34.360 --> 57:38.206
- So I can't leave you alone with the kids.
- Of course, you can. I'll be fine.

57:38.280 --> 57:41.602
Well, Å½iÅ¾ek is speaking.

57:41.680 --> 57:44.251
- Å½iÅ¾ek? You love Å½iÅ¾ek.
- Yeah.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.651
How do you know?

57:47.120 --> 57:49.248
I think you've mentioned him.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.561
Hey.

58:01.400 --> 58:02.731
Excuse me!

58:04.520 --> 58:05.601
John Harding?

58:07.600 --> 58:10.843
I'm reading Rituals of Commodity Fetishism
at the Tail End of the Empire.

58:10.920 --> 58:12.285
Yeah, how you making out?

58:12.360 --> 58:16.809
It's tremendous.
We all came up here just to hear you speak.

58:17.760 --> 58:21.048
- And Å½iÅ¾ek. Obviously.
- And Å½iÅ¾ek, right. Obviously.

58:22.160 --> 58:23.810
This is kind of fetishy,

58:25.200 --> 58:27.567
- but would you sign my book?
- Yeah, of course.

58:30.680 --> 58:32.045
- What's your name?
- Al.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.765
- Thank you.
- Al? Take care.

58:41.880 --> 58:45.362
- Fancy meeting you here.
- What are you doing here?

58:45.440 --> 58:47.488
I'm just giving a paper, you know.

58:48.760 --> 58:51.127
Did you write to me
that you were coming here?

58:51.200 --> 58:53.009
I mean, I remember that you
were leaving town, but...

58:53.080 --> 58:55.765
I don't know. I have no idea.

58:56.360 --> 58:57.646
You sorry you came?

58:57.760 --> 59:01.651
No. It's big enough for the both of us.
Isn't it?

59:02.160 --> 59:04.891
- You look really well.
- I feel well.

59:04.960 --> 59:05.961
Beautiful here, yeah?

59:06.040 --> 59:09.442
It is. It is. The air is great. So far.

59:10.480 --> 59:13.211
Can I sit down?
Or is it better if we don't co-mingle?

59:13.320 --> 59:16.688
- It's fine. Why not? We are friends.
- Sure, sure.

59:16.760 --> 59:19.604
This is Debbie Wasserman. From Yale.

59:19.680 --> 59:21.921
- Hi, Debbie.
- Nice to meet you.

59:24.200 --> 59:28.410
- Did Maggie tell you we met?
- Yes. She really enjoyed meeting you.

59:28.480 --> 59:31.131
- She's an interesting person.
- Really, you think so?

59:31.200 --> 59:34.090
- It's very surprising.
- I didn't know you had time to be surprised.

59:34.160 --> 59:38.563
You know, you concoct ideas
of what your rival will be like.

59:38.640 --> 59:40.210
But she's not my rival anymore.

59:41.400 --> 59:42.401
Good.

59:42.480 --> 59:45.609
Paul told me that Maggie taught him

59:45.680 --> 59:48.001
to do a figure eight the other day
when they were ice-skating.

59:48.080 --> 59:51.050
- He was very proud.
- She's so good with him, you know.

59:51.120 --> 59:54.681
Yes. She sounds like a very capable person.

59:55.160 --> 59:56.366
She's a natural mother.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.649
She sounds like
a wonderful partner for you.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.931
Will you excuse me?
I have to make a phone call.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.361
Aren't you gonna eat?

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.047
I'm not very hungry.
And I think maybe you're right.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.726
Maybe it's a mistake
if we co-mingle too much.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.488
We'll only end up
getting on each other's nerves.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:31.647
Komiko has designed the first patented doll
with removable internal organs.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.281
60% of children have fears about death.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.768
And Komiko's plan is to relieve their fears
about the body

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.650
by helping them see what's inside.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.326
They can draw on the organs.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.770
But all of the elements
are completely washable.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.491
So we think
that this would really appeal to parents

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.131
interested in marriage-based toys.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.727
I mean, knowledge... Knowledge-based toys.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.166
There's no heat.
The fucking Internet doesn't work.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.925
The generator blew up, or something.
My batteries are about to die.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.401
And get this, all right? Guess who's here.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.927
Georgette!

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.560
Really? That must... How is that?

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.166
I don't know
I mean, her mood matches the weather.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.605
I'm sorry.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.127
- How's everybody there?
- We're fine. Everyone's great.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.091
Well, I can't get any info on
when the airports are gonna open up again.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.204
So it looks like I'm stuck here!

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.490
I mean, they're breaking out the snowshoes,
which, to me, is ominous.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.249
That's a good one. That's really nice.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.410
I love you so much.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.370
- How much? Wait, I know.
- How much?

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.649
25, 362.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.811
That's exactly how much!
That's exactly right.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.845
I want to live inside a bubble.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.006
Me, too.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.409
But I want my own bubble.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.687
Yeah, that's okay.
We can each have our own bubble.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.328
- Daddy has his own bubble.
- I can see Daddy in his bubble.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.850
I'm all right.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.725
Typical.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.362
We can just follow the tracks back.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.127
Nothing really looks familiar, does it?

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.803
You know the talk you gave yesterday
was just great.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.281
I didn't even know
you were working in that direction.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.931
I guess you haven't seen anything
I've written for a while.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.280
No, I miss that!

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.047
You do?

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.602
I used to like that.
You know, give each other our stuff.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.649
Forget about me.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.082
That talk you gave yesterday
was the hit of the conference.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.644
It was just all the old ideas.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.371
You altered that passage on de Tocqueville.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.562
- Nothing gets by you.
- Your work feels so fresh.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.849
No one unpacks commodity fetishism
like you do.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.251
Shucks!

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.042
- You still working on your novel?
- Yeah.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.010
- How's it coming?
- Fine.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.167
John?

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.806
I don't mean to be insulting
about your fiction.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.531
It's just I'm so proud
of the academic work you've done.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.044
You see here how much people love it.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.248
Well, I'm not abandoning anything.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.451
Come on. I don't want you getting too cold.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.487
- What is it?
- I've something I want to tell you.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.771
Okay. What?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.966
I'm sorry.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.810
- For what?
- For being so self-centered.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.568
For not listening to you, to what you needed,
for not investing in your work.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.801
You don't have to say that.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.204
I think I became so caught up in succeeding,
in making a name for myself.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.489
I stopped paying attention to you,
to us, to our marriage.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:01.122
And now I have success,
it's as if I've emerged from a tunnel.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.603
And I hope in the future,
to be less self-absorbed.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.282
If I ever get another chance at love.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.011
What are you saying?
Of course you'll get another chance.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.927
- You think so?
- Yeah. Come on!

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.490
I'm sure they're lining up.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.082
Are we going to die here?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.686
No, God...

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.121
Hello!

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.684
Hello!

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.040
- Help!
- It's okay.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.087
Help!

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.646
Hey, all you French-Canadian people!

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.930
We have no fucking idea where we are!

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.401
It's okay.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.081
We were lost.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.041
Thank you.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.284
You should sing it!

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.891
I have written my way so far up
my own ass, I can't see my way out.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.645
And the whole story bores me to death.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.441
So stop writing it.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.684
No, I can't. I feel like if I don't produce
some kind of masterpiece, you know,

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.607
Maggie's gonna give up on me.
That book is a big part of why she fell for me.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.761
I gotta tell you, Georgette.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.650
If I have learned one thing
in the last three years,

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.326
it's that I'm not a fucking novelist!
I'm not!

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.086
If she truly loves you,

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.801
she'll love you whether you're a novelist
or a garbage collector.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.244
You loved me like that, didn't you?

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.523
They've opened the airport!
We can go home tomorrow!

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.404
Better go pack.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.201
I don't want to go.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.365
I don't want to leave you.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.082
- John...
- I just...

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.970
I want you so badly,
I can't think about anything.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.122
It's like the last three years
just never happened.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.488
- Or that I'm hallucinating.
- It did happen. It all happened.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.041
I know. I know! I know!

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.484
We have to be real. The snow is melting.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.241
John,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.729
there's something you should know.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:04.481
What is it?

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.486
- You regret it?
- We belong to each other.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:32.203
Actually, for me, it was a one-night stand.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.763
Seriously, I've changed.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.885
I know I can live without you now.
I just don't want to.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.285
That's good.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.810
I would like to read your novel now.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.604
- Really?
- I know you have a copy.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.125
I saw you marking one up.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.569
Be careful what you wish for.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.125
- Hi!
- Hi. Where's Lily?

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.283
Felicia took her to this dance class.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.522
- How'd your talk go?
- It went great.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.725
I mean, not great. It was well attended.
I got a few laughs.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.929
Good. How was stuff with Georgette?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.651
- She eventually defrosted.
- Good.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.449
I should tell you something.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.606
Okay.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.081
- You know we were snowed-in?
- Yeah. I know that.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.568
So Georgette and I were thrown together
for two whole days, right?

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.564
And so there was this whole

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.011
atmosphere, you know, of...

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.601
I started unearthing things, you know.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.365
Old stuff.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.968
Good stuff or bad stuff?

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.325
I don't know.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.526
But

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.725
emotional.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.601
Nostalgic.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.406
- The same stuff.
- The same as what?

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.682
Fuck. Fuck. I'm so sorry.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.125
What happened?

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.206
Georgette and I slept together.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.251
- Georgette was right.
- About what?

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.005
We should've...

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.647
We should've just been an affair.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.721
Maggie, don't say that.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.768
You were in such a bad place...

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.330
- What about Lily?
- ...in your marriage.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.765
- And then I came along.
- What about Lily?

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.171
I know, I know.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.766
- Come on, what we had was real.
- That's right.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.208
When I met you, I was lost.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.681
I was a fucking mess, all right?

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.765
I was so insecure,
and you saved me, all right?

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.086
You rescued me.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.482
Now, I don't know what to do. I...

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.646
- You know what to do.
- No, I don't.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.364
Just go back to Georgette.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.410
Really?

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.888
- If you love her.
- I... You think?

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.528
Shit. Fuck.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.288
I don't know what to do.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.044
I try that, too,
only that at school when I do that,

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.531
it usually falls on the floor.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.807
- But when I actually do it...
- Thank you.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.362
...after a long time,
everyone just goes, "Yeah."

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.611
And then after, like five seconds everyone,
like, totally ignores me.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.202
- And then I'm all like, "Come on."
- What are you doing here?

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.401
I accidentally ran into your mom at school.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.642
We both thought
it was our turn to pick up Paul.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.649
Yeah! That was so funny!

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.562
Anyway, and then your mom
graciously invited me over to...

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.766
- You finished?
- ...dinner.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.407
You guys really need to learn how
to coordinate your schedules.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:23.363
Yeah, well. You know, there's no harm
in us spending time together as a family.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.408
Except for isn't
that the point of a divorce?

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.403
That you're not a family anymore?

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.690
Great seeing everybody!
Justine, do your homework!

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.723
Mom?

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.370
What is it, Paul darling?

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.171
- I'm hungry!
- You just ate!

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.205
What can I have?

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.088
You can have a plate of saltines,

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.369
a cheese stick and an apple.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.685
- Can you cut up the apple?
- Ask Justine!

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.283
She's busy!

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.006
- This is ridiculous. I have to go. I have to go.
- Where will you stay?

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.402
I don't know. I'll just call some friends
and I'll just avoid a hotel.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.522
We've gotta give them time to adjust.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.046
All right, Paul,
here I come to cut up your apple.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.644
Hey, Jonathan.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.323
I don't know if you guys are, you know,
back yet or not.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.131
But, listen, if you are,
give me a shout, okay?

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.091
I think... Hey, Ben I don't know if
your couch is available.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.131
But I can bring beer!

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.322
Felicia. Thank God you're home.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.404
Hi, how are you doing?

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.601
Not so good.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.643
- So she already told you guys?
- Well, she...

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.166
- Has she called you?
- No, she called me.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.164
I don't think she's talked to Tony.
He's been out all day.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.369
What did she say? Is she all right?
You think she's gonna be okay?

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.249
- What is this...
- You know Maggie, she...

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.129
- She takes care of herself.
- I know. I know. I know.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.611
She's taken care of herself her whole life.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.445
- I mean, she's emotional.
- Yeah, right... It's just...

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.483
It all seems so unreal.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.606
I know... I just...

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.166
- Look, I think that you need to be honest.
- Well, sure...

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.521
- I mean, I'm trying to be honest.
- You know, when you can.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.841
I mean, it's... I mean... I'm surprised!

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.651
- You know, I mean...
- Listen, I know, I mean, I don't...

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.326
I don't know, but I can only imagine.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.809
- John! Aren't you supposed to be in Canada?
- No, he's here.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.770
- Yeah, I'm here. You had a trial?
- Yeah.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.120
- Did you win?
- Trounced them!

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.247
Yeah? What was it for?

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.049
- Tainted pudding.
- Tainted pudding.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.886
- Like, a lawsuit?
- You betcha! It's what keeps my wife

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.442
in post-modern choreography
and me in self-loathing.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.761
Yay.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.805
It keeps the world going round round here.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.848
If you're gonna have that attitude,
you should go to bed.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.927
No. No, no, no.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.642
I want that vanilla whiskey that you
so lovingly gave me last Christmas, Fi.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.884
Really? 'Cause I feel like you've had
more than you need of something already.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.884
No, no, no, no.
This stuff's like liquid crack, John.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.247
You're gonna love it.
Would you like a finger full?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.968
- There's three fingers in there.
- Cheers.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.730
- Nice.
- John...

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.131
- Jesus.
- What?

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.565
I just sat on my balls.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.365
I think you should probably get your balls
hemmed like that actor. What's his name?

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.730
You know, apparently
it's like a few stitches, and then...

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.171
It's like a ball lift.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.365
- John, any word?
- You haven't talked to Maggie?

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.525
No. I've been up to my knees in pudding.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.644
- Well...
- Yeah, tell him.

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.205
Well... John and Maggie...

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.760
- No, tell him.
- Sorry, right.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.367
- He and Georgette...
- What? Like, it worked?

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.961
That's nuts.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.886
What worked?

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.645
What do you mean?

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.728
What's the thing they say
about drinks and tits?

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.411
That one's too few and three are too many.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.090
- I shouldn't drink.
- You're not a drinker.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.162
- I'm not a drinker.
- Shit.

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.201
This is what Georgette
was trying to tell me about...

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.361
No, no, no.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.645
- Tony.
- She might have been trying to tell you...

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.687
You guys set me up?

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.807
- No! No!
- God, no!

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.450
No, no one set anybody up.
Set-up is such a strong word.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.607
Don't say "set-up."

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.720
John?

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.685
Was it a test?

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.408
Is that it? To see if I was
still in love with Georgette

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.443
as you secretly suspected?

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.569
You must be very happy now.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.005
I felt we were going to break up.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.564
And I had a feeling that you
were still in love with Georgette.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.361
And it turns out you were.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.602
Well, what about Lily? Our daughter.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.241
- How does she fit into your little scheme?
- If we were going to break up,

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.370
it's best that we just do it now,
so this is all that she knows.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.922
But I didn't want to break up!
I didn't want to!

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.846
First off, among other things,
because I am committed to our marriage!

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.561
- And because we have a child together.
- But not because you want to be with me.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.688
This is the fate
you have picked out for me?

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.923
To ricochet across the tri-state area,
just ruining families?

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.486
I don't accept that, all right?
I didn't pick that.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.844
I cannot believe you made me feel so guilty
for betraying you

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.890
and wrecking our marriage,
when you masterminded this whole thing.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.406
You manipulated me back with my ex.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.926
The two of you colluded
to send me to that conference,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.651
like I'm some kind of an absurd patsy.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.247
Guess what?
This little puppet is cutting his strings.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.967
You can both go fuck yourselves.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.566
You and Georgette never really
stopped being together

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.881
- the whole time we were married.
- What?

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.282
I mean, yes, I know you thought
it was over, but it wasn't really.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.727
And this is the proof.
Just be honest with yourself.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.610
- It's what you wanted.
- No, Maggie, no.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.006
What do you want? That's the question.
What do you want, Maggie Hardin?

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.488
I want to live honestly.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.407
- You're off to a great start.
- I don't want to be in a marriage that's a lie.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.327
I don't want to tiptoe around
our disconnection anymore.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.088
- I did what I thought was right.
- Well, you're very ethical.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.605
Well, you're the one who slept
with someone else.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.763
Give me a fucking break with that one.
Give me a break with that.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.641
Where are you going?

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.526
I have no idea.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.484
What about the kids?

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.564
You and Georgette are such good teammates.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.404
Why don't you strategize with her?

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.681
Wiglet...

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.049
I made a big mess.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.000
- You made a mess?
- Yes.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.723
And I don't know how to clean it up.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.368
But why did you not use a sponge?

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.802
Just forget about it.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.530
- He found out.
- How?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.649
My friend, Tony.
He was drunk and it slipped.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.724
It was inevitable.
I almost told him myself several times.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.727
It was the tragic flaw in my plan.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.761
Where is he?

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.281
I don't know.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.928
I think he's just really sick of us both
right now. Mostly me.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.607
Georgette. I don't know what to say.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.729
You're a funny person.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.404
There is something so pure about you.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.528
You know, and a little bit stupid.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.721
And it's a kind of innocence.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.724
You know, just so unconscious.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.002
I can't help it. I like you.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.047
I don't blame you. I just shouldn't have
let him back in my life again.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.681
I decided against it, even in Canada.
But it was the snow.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.161
It was the cozy, cozy snow.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.001
We just fell for each other again.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.250
- I wanted my husband back.
- You don't have to lose him.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.211
You know what? If you see him,
you tell him for me to screw off.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:25.121
Say it! Screw off, okay? Darling, come.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.123
If you want me to take the kids
for a few days...

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.771
No, stop it. Stop trying to take care
of everybody all the time.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.561
No, it's no trouble at all.
Plus, they're used to me, right, Justine?

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.642
Can you please just tell me
what's going on?

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:42.086
Your dad and I got into a big fight
and he's taking some time.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.763
- Are you and him getting back together?
- It's a complex situation.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.606
- Are you sad?
- No.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.011
Angry?

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.328
You guys have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.048
I mean, there's no plan.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.171
Is there?

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.091
What about you?

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.205
- Justine, did you find your charger?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.525
Where's my science book?

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:45.405
- No. Did you get any sleep?
- Maybe two hours.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.684
- Go back to bed.
- No, no. I'll help. I'll go back later.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.366
- But we're fine. We're fine.
- I want to help.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.566
All right. Okay.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.526
Lily, let's get your shoes on.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.649
Justine, did you remember
your basketball uniform? I washed it.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.881
It's folded!

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.567
The lunches are on the counter.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.442
And it's quarter after,
so we're gonna be late.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.241
- I can't find any of my socks.
- Just check the laundry basket.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.840
- They're all dirty.
- Just wear them anyway.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.249
Okay! We're good to go. Let's all go.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.327
- Maggie?
- Yes?

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:33.530
Just get all your stuff together
and I'll be there in a second.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.841
Wait!

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.286
Paul, can you just climb on through
so we can get her in.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.761
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.445
Is something burning?

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.361
No.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.880
Hi, darling. Hi.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.201
Hi.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.166
- Thank God it's Friday.
- I know.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.410
So I was thinking if we take
all the kids ice-skating,

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.529
then you can take Justine to that movie.
Because I think it's gonna scare Paul.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.681
- No, it won't!
- Don't worry.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:45.207
I'll take you and Lily to something else.
Why don't we see what's playing?

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.164
Justine, where are the Band-Aids?

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.451
- Have you heard from John?
- I did.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.531
He sold his car and he bought a motorcycle.
And he's taking us to the Giants on Sunday.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.285
- For God's sake.
- Where is he living?

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.840
I don't know.
But I can ask him when we're in the stands.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.649
- Justine, can you take Paul in to watch TV?
- Come on.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.366
What is it?

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.848
I just think if you guys saw
each other again...

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.810
No, no. No more matchmaking ideas.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.962
No more ideas, period.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.929
You've had your thinking license revoked.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.204
I'm not gonna get involved with
anybody's fate ever again. Not even my own.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.046
I'm gonna become a completely passive,

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.251
non-interventional

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.561
Buddhist.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.883
But I think that if you just saw him,
you guys just...

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.082
You have to let this go, Maggie.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.763
This story has its own momentum,
apart from you. It always did.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.723
I am so sick of being me.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.410
You should really try the tapping.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.289
- Try what?
- I went to this workshop on biofeedback.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.845
It's amazing.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:22.369
What you do is, you figure out what
the essential thing is you want to change.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.408
And then you make a sort of a dictum.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.524
Like, for you, for instance,
"I am not controlling,"

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.922
- if that is what you want to change.
- Yes, that's perfect.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:36.011
- Okay, so "I am not controlling."
- I am not controlling.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:44.841
- I am not controlling.
- I am not controlling.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.730
You wanted to see me?

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.771
Yes. I wanted to return your book.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.004
- And where should I scatter these?
- Anywhere is fine.

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.327
I cannot believe, on top of everything else,
you burned my fucking book.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.845
I burned a copy of your book.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.604
- You probably didn't even read it.
- Of course I read it.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.889
That's why I burned it. You cannibalized
our marriage to write that story.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.042
You didn't even bother to
fictionalize us in yours.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.087
I don't write fiction.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.404
You think you painted a precise portrait
of us in Bring Back the Geisha?

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.242
I cannot believe you're making me feel bad
about the sins of my unpublished manuscript

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.881
and you're glossing over
your actual lies and manipulation?

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.008
I'm not a liar. I never ever lie.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.447
I lie now. I manipulated.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.047
I debased myself morally
because I loved you so terribly much.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.204
Maybe you could be flattered.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.967
If you love me, why not just tell me?

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.565
You were married.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.841
Georgette.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.563
So you won't take responsibility
for the state of your life?

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.001
- You're just a victim of our plot?
- I'm not a victim.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:19.244
I'm just a man who has fucked
his whole life up, and now I'm looking

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.560
for an Airbnb to live in.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.044
- So there's nothing more to say.
- Okay.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.805
No other conversation. End it like that.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.805
The reason your book doesn't work is
you put too much weight in the allegory.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.331
You're trying to use fiction
to prove a thesis.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.203
The text is crying out for
pure passages of economic theory.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.409
Narrative blended with theory
is your specialty.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.651
Make it a John Harding book.
It could be a phenomenon.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.006
- You really think so?
- I know it, John.

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.801
You just have to accept it'll be published
by Yale University Press, and not Scribner's.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.765
Probably be shortlisted
for a Bateson Prize.

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.403
You might even win one.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.601
Fuck.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.760
- You did it again.
- What?

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.331
You know me better than I know me.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.890
Sometimes I wish I didn't.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:23.289
You look so good in this light.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.286
I'll seek out these lighting conditions
whenever possible, in that case.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.807
You look so nice.
I love that polka dot dress.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.009
- Yeah, no!
- Not really.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.369
- I think you'd be a great hockey player.
- Look who it is.

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.284
Happy birthday, Lily!

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.009
Okay, have fun, all right? You got her?

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.769
Winter sports aren't really
your strong suit, are they?

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:07.202
It's not fair. In skates I'm not
even able to defend myself.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.126
I'm gonna keep you on ice
for the rest of your life, in that case.

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.770
- Here we go, all right?
- No, no.

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.649
- We're gonna go fast.
- John! No!

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:21.730
Did it ever occur to you
this might have just happened anyway?

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.486
Even if you hadn't played Titania
and sprinkled fairy dust in their eyes?

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.528
- Of course it's occurred to me.
- Yeah.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.767
I guess you'll never know
if it was you or the hand of destiny.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.167
I've decided to embrace
the mystery of the universe,

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.163
and stop bossing everybody around so much.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.163
Good luck with that, bossy pants.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.844
He's gonna write a book about us one day,
and we are not gonna look good.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.683
3,000, 100, 15,000.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.930
What kind of 3-year-old loves
numbers that much?

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.842
Was John into math? I know you weren't.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.724
I'm not sure.
