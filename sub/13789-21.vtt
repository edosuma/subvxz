00:07.338 --> 00:09.480
The new couch
looks great, hon,

00:09.480 --> 00:12.243
but I have to say,
I'm gonna miss this old fella.

00:12.243 --> 00:14.845
We had a lot of good times,
didn't we, friend?

00:14.845 --> 00:18.119
All the naps,
TV we watched.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.451
I feel like the kids
grew up on this couch.

00:20.451 --> 00:22.053
This one
has a recliner.

00:22.053 --> 00:24.425
Get this outta here.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.928
Thank you so much
for donating your old couch

00:27.928 --> 00:29.460
to Guardian Angels
charity.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.303
I had a dog like this
when I was a kid.

00:32.303 --> 00:33.934
I used to call him
Quat.

00:33.934 --> 00:36.207
Oh, so you could say,
"Come, Quat."

00:36.207 --> 00:40.040
No, we used to say
"Hey, Quat." What
a wasted opportunity.

00:41.312 --> 00:42.513
Right. You're all set.

00:42.513 --> 00:44.215
So you have your receipt.

00:44.215 --> 00:45.476
You didn't give me
a receipt.

00:45.476 --> 00:46.847
Oh, really?

00:46.847 --> 00:49.350
Well, then, what's
this over here?

00:49.350 --> 00:51.582
How did you do that?

00:51.582 --> 00:53.524
When I'm not working
for the charity,

00:53.524 --> 00:55.486
I'm an amateur magician.

00:55.486 --> 00:57.458
[feigns retching]

01:03.534 --> 01:05.966
For me? How sweet.

01:05.966 --> 01:09.100
Really, you want this?
It's been in my mouth.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.401
It's a free scarf.

01:16.107 --> 01:18.549
Kids, who's ready
for a surprise?

01:18.549 --> 01:21.512
- A surprise?
- [Chloe] I love surprises.

01:21.512 --> 01:22.813
Is it a new couch?

01:22.813 --> 01:24.615
How did you guess that?

01:27.388 --> 01:30.521
I guess it's kinda hard
to make a new couch a surprise.

01:30.521 --> 01:32.863
Not if you do it
just right.

01:32.863 --> 01:35.726
Get ready
for a surprise!

01:35.726 --> 01:37.728
One, two, three.

Take your blindfolds off.

01:40.871 --> 01:42.733
[all] A new couch?!

01:44.575 --> 01:47.738
You're right, Avery.
That would've been
so much better.

01:47.738 --> 01:51.642
I knew it was coming,
but the showmanship.

01:51.642 --> 01:53.344
And here's
the best part.

01:53.344 --> 01:55.516
This couch has
a recliner,

01:55.516 --> 01:58.749
a massage feature,
and a secret pocket

01:58.749 --> 02:00.391
where Chloe can
hide her rats.

02:00.391 --> 02:03.824
- What?
- What?!

02:03.824 --> 02:05.956
I'm gonna nap on you.

02:05.956 --> 02:08.229
I'm gonna nap on you
so hard.

02:26.116 --> 02:28.479
The best thing
about the new couch

02:28.479 --> 02:31.452
is that the family
set aside a special spot
for me and the puppies.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.585
Having our own spot
on the couch

02:34.585 --> 02:36.056
is just one of the ways
I've been feeling

02:36.056 --> 02:37.458
more a part of the family
lately.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.860
My artwork's
even on the fridge.

02:41.131 --> 02:43.634
That's Tyler's.

02:43.634 --> 02:46.066
That's mine.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.639
But we gotta hide it
when Princess comes over.

02:48.639 --> 02:50.471
It's an ex-girlfriend.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.749
Hey, Tyler, Mom and Dad
are at a movie,

02:58.749 --> 03:00.651
and Chloe and I are going
to the aquarium

03:00.651 --> 03:05.716
to see the manatees
and the woman-atees.

03:05.716 --> 03:08.489
They're not called that,
but they should be.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.760
You guys
have fun with that.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.292
I'm designing
an app to sell

03:11.292 --> 03:13.794
that lets people use
my face as an emoji.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.900
That's a cool
app, Tyler.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.172
Wouldn't it sell better if
people could use their own faces

03:22.172 --> 03:23.504
instead of yours?

03:23.504 --> 03:25.506
I don't think so,
Avery.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.178
Have you seen
other people's faces?

03:31.442 --> 03:32.683
All right,
we're going.

03:32.683 --> 03:34.144
Have a nice time
with your face.

03:36.046 --> 03:37.948
Wait. You know what?
I'll come with you guys
to the aquarium.

03:37.948 --> 03:40.451
I like looking at
the sea anemones,

03:40.451 --> 03:43.454
mostly because I just learned
how to pronounce sea "amenomes."

03:43.454 --> 03:44.695
Dang it.

03:44.695 --> 03:46.857
Stan, do you
wanna come, too?

03:46.857 --> 03:49.430
I'd say yes, but I have
a lot of work to do

03:49.430 --> 03:52.232
trimming my banzai tree.
It's a new hobby I'm trying.

- Bye, Stan.

I thought it would.

Hi. I'm a whale.

04:43.354 --> 04:45.215
So did you guys have fun
at the aquarium?

04:45.215 --> 04:46.587
I'm a shark.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.889
I'm a better shark.

Oh, you always win
at this game.

Oh, no, the new couch.

05:08.339 --> 05:11.111
They must've gotten in because
someone left the door open.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.113
I think I was
the last one out.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.845
I opened the door,
and I didn't close it.

05:14.845 --> 05:17.017
But it could've
been worse.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.050
They didn't take
the TV, guys, huh? Huh?

05:21.652 --> 05:23.454
[Bennett] Kids,
we're home.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.155
[screams]

05:25.155 --> 05:26.797
What happened here?

05:26.797 --> 05:28.629
The door was
accidentally left open,

05:28.629 --> 05:29.830
and raccoons got in.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.662
You guys left
the door open?

05:31.662 --> 05:34.605
I cannot believe you
could be so irresponsible.

05:34.605 --> 05:36.637
This is why we can't
have nice things,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.769
because doors get
left open and raccoons
get in.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.671
Why not just invite
a hawk in here

05:40.671 --> 05:42.873
to go after my eyes?

05:42.873 --> 05:44.815
Which one of you
left the door open?

05:46.677 --> 05:48.749
It had to be one of you.
Who else could it have been?

05:51.281 --> 05:53.053
If no one is gonna
take the blame,

05:53.053 --> 05:54.785
you're all responsible.

05:54.785 --> 05:56.657
Clearly, you all went
to the aquarium

05:56.657 --> 05:59.730
and didn't bring me back
a shark grabber on a stick.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.632
Would've been nice
to sit on my new couch

06:01.632 --> 06:03.734
and grab the remote with
my new shark grabber.

06:03.734 --> 06:06.897
But that dream
died today.

06:06.897 --> 06:09.099
Yeah, you're all
getting punished.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.901
And why didn't I get
a seal plushy

06:10.901 --> 06:13.844
so I could give things
my "seal" of approval?

06:13.844 --> 06:15.406
And I'd say
"Good one, Ellen,"

06:15.406 --> 06:16.747
but you all
don't deserve it.

06:16.747 --> 06:18.779
That's right, that's
how mad I am.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.413
You kids are grounded
for a month.

06:22.413 --> 06:23.854
But the school dance.

06:23.854 --> 06:25.416
And Darcy's
sleepover.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.988
And I'm an adult.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.090
You live in this house.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.792
You're grounded.

Guys, I am so sorry

06:35.726 --> 06:38.098
you're taking
the heat for this.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.772
Darcy and I have been planning
this sleepover for weeks.

06:41.772 --> 06:44.875
We invited all the cool
girls from school.

06:44.875 --> 06:48.879
And Abigail, so we wouldn't
look so obvious about it.

06:48.879 --> 06:52.112
My friends and I were gonna
go camping at the beach.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.645
Now I have to text them
and tell them I'm not coming.

06:59.349 --> 07:02.192
And Dax was gonna
take me to the dance.

07:02.192 --> 07:04.925
Now he's gonna ask
someone else.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.857
I gotta text him.

07:06.857 --> 07:09.229
Sorry. I can't go
to the dance.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.765
I can't believe Dax
downloaded your app.

07:15.806 --> 07:18.338
I feel horrible about this.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.840
You guys have been
getting blamed for things

07:19.840 --> 07:21.772
I've done
for three years now.

07:21.772 --> 07:24.044
You'd be better off if
I couldn't open doors

07:24.044 --> 07:27.217
and didn't even care about
going places with you.

07:27.217 --> 07:30.981
You'd be better off if...
if I were a cat.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.432
A cat wouldn't have
gotten the kids into
trouble like this.

07:42.432 --> 07:45.435
I wish I were a cat.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.943
What? I'm a cat!

07:57.978 --> 08:00.811
I'm a cat.
My wish came true.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.956
Wait a minute.
You're the guy
from the charity.

08:05.956 --> 08:07.858
What are you doing here?

08:07.858 --> 08:09.760
I'm your guardian
angel, Stan.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.862
Though my name may sound
a bit peculiar to mortal ears.

08:11.862 --> 08:13.023
It's...

08:13.023 --> 08:15.195
[sound of celestial choir]

08:17.067 --> 08:18.829
But my friends
call me Ralph.

08:18.829 --> 08:20.971
I granted your wish
to be a cat.

08:20.971 --> 08:22.603
- So can I...
- Talk?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.875
No. I can hear your thoughts,
but you can't talk.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.907
I was gonna say
still lick myself.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.279
Oh. Well, then, yes.

08:29.279 --> 08:31.542
In fact, you can
probably lick even
more of yourself than before.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.884
I'll get into that
later.

08:35.045 --> 08:37.047
I'm glad I'm a cat.

08:37.047 --> 08:39.119
Now I won't have to worry
about causing problems

08:39.119 --> 08:41.652
for the kids
ever again.

08:41.652 --> 08:43.293
I feel horrible
about what happened.

08:43.293 --> 08:46.026
I'm sorry
you feel down.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.859
Aw, maybe I can
cheer you up
with a magic trick.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.803
Hey, that does
cheer me up.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.708
Now I'm sad again.

08:59.369 --> 09:02.573
[laughs]
Hey, that's cheating.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.575
It's not magic
if you have powers.

09:04.575 --> 09:07.147
No, this is real
sleight-of-hand.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.380
I only use my powers
to change lives,

09:10.380 --> 09:12.052
make the world
a better place,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.154
and keep caterpillars
from killing everyone.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.926
They really want to.

09:17.527 --> 09:19.559
Wait a minute.
If I'm a cat,

09:19.559 --> 09:22.492
what about my puppies
and my wife?

09:22.492 --> 09:24.494
Oh, you mean Princess.

09:24.494 --> 09:26.697
The cat that lives
next door.

09:26.697 --> 09:28.769
And your kittens.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.971
Oh, this is great.
My kids are cute,

09:30.971 --> 09:32.903
I'm still married
to Princess.

09:32.903 --> 09:34.945
With me as a cat,
everyone is better off.

09:34.945 --> 09:37.007
[Avery] Anyone know
what's for dinner?

09:37.007 --> 09:38.879
Oh, I'm gonna go
say hi to Avery.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.811
You better hide here
so she doesn't see you

09:40.811 --> 09:42.112
and freak out.

09:42.112 --> 09:43.814
Oh, she can't see me.

09:43.814 --> 09:45.986
In fact, no one can
see or hear me but you.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.588
So it's exactly like
I've gone crazy.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.060
Precisely.

09:53.323 --> 09:57.567
Does no one in this stupid
house know what's for dinner?

09:59.229 --> 10:01.271
What's going on
with Avery?

10:02.933 --> 10:05.776
When the kids didn't get along
three years ago,

10:05.776 --> 10:08.108
Bennett brought home
a cat instead of a dog.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.310
So a lot of things
are different.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.112
Like Tyler.

10:16.847 --> 10:18.849
Metalwolf!

10:21.221 --> 10:24.094
Tyler, I can't believe
you're listening to
that lame band.

10:24.094 --> 10:26.226
They're changing
lives, Avery.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.429
Before I heard Metalwolf,
I didn't even know their music.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.903
Now I do.
Think about that.

10:32.903 --> 10:35.936
And now you're painting
your face like them.

10:35.936 --> 10:39.069
- I'm part of a pack.
- Yeah, I saw you guys
biting each other's necks

10:39.069 --> 10:40.440
in the parking lot.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.443
It's how we say hello.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.016
Ugh! It's as lame
as your hair.

10:46.016 --> 10:48.278
I don't care what
anybody thinks about my hair.

10:48.278 --> 10:50.821
Where am I?

10:50.821 --> 10:54.284
I'm gonna wipe that hideous
makeup off your face.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.258
I don't get it.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.990
Why are they
fighting like that?

10:59.990 --> 11:01.331
Because of your wish,

11:01.331 --> 11:03.393
dog Stan never came
into the family

11:03.393 --> 11:05.635
to bring them together,
so they never learned
to get along.

11:05.635 --> 11:07.197
Get outta my face!

11:07.197 --> 11:10.170
It's not your face.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.371
Wait a minute.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.907
This is all because
I wasn't part of the family?

11:16.907 --> 11:18.909
Without Avery's positive
influence on Tyler,

11:18.909 --> 11:20.650

22:20.640 --> 22:22.572
I'm just glad
we got the old couch back.

22:22.572 --> 22:23.873
I actually
kinda missed it.

22:23.873 --> 22:25.815
Sometimes you don't

22:25.815 --> 22:28.077

have it anymore.
