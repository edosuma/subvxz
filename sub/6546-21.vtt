WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.500
(Audrey): Previously, on Haven.

00:02.628 --> 00:04.914
- Everything that I do
in this town hurts someone.

00:06.257 --> 00:07.793
I want to know what the hell
is wrong with me.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.040
- There's nothing wrong with you.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.213
You are who you
were always meant to be.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.508
- The game was played and lost.
Croatoan won.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.552
- You saw a thinny on the beach?

00:17.685 --> 00:19.801
There's another way
into the Void.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.973
Dave knew everyone
except that woman at the beach.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.642
- Well, where are we going
to find a mystery woman

00:23.774 --> 00:25.150
from almost 30 years ago?

00:25.276 --> 00:26.391
- We're going back in time.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.064
I'm looking for this woman.
- Barbara Colton?

00:29.197 --> 00:32.735
- Now's not really a good time.
- That ring.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.153
l was right, she makes Thinnies.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.402
We got to put this ring
on a Colton.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.995
- Without a Colton,
we cannot get into the Void.

00:40.124 --> 00:43.082
Your trip didn't change anything.
- It changed everything.

00:43.211 --> 00:47.204
"Duke, it’s Nathan writing from 1983.
I found a way to save Haven.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.581
"I need you to ﬁnd a member
of the Colton family

00:49.717 --> 00:51.173
and bring them back to Haven. "

00:51.302 --> 00:52.883
- l'm Hailie Colton.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.001
- Hailie.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.550
- And Charlotte didn't tell you
what this controller was

01:00.686 --> 01:02.517
or how it worked?

01:02.647 --> 01:04.183
(Nathan): Well, there wasn't time.

01:04.315 --> 01:08.183
She just said we needed to build a new Barn
that would end the Troubles.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.275
- And it's in the Void?

01:10.404 --> 01:13.237
- Somewhere in the wreckage
of the old Barn.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.197
- Hey, you know that's hot.

01:19.330 --> 01:20.786
- No, I don't.

01:32.343 --> 01:36.211
- Mm-hmm.
- What, you don't like my shirt?

01:36.347 --> 01:38.713
- Oh, I'm just checking you out.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.225
I like you like this.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.307
- What, half dressed?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.812
- No...

01:45.189 --> 01:46.474
Here.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.815
With me. Safe.

01:51.404 --> 01:55.773
Just feels like every time
we come back together again,

01:55.908 --> 02:00.277
one of us has to go off
and save the world.

02:00.413 --> 02:04.122
- Mm, yeah, wouldn't it be nice
to just stay here?

02:04.250 --> 02:05.956
Maybe go for a Sunday drive.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.291
- Yeah.

02:07.420 --> 02:10.628
- Saving the world
is just so exhausting.

02:10.756 --> 02:13.839
- I know, right?
- lam so tired.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.470
Parker.
- Hm?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.513
When Duke comes back,
I am gonna have to go into the Void.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.264
We both know that.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.353
- And you're so sure
that he's coming back?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.946
- Yeah, he will.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.656
Once he gets what he needs.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.813
- Haven.

03:14.945 --> 03:19.655
I thought you were crazy, Duke,
but I remember this place.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.320
- You were born here.

03:21.452 --> 03:25.320
- Yeah, I just don't remember
it being so bleak.

03:25.456 --> 03:28.869
- Yeah, it looks like a lot's changed.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.663
Come on.

03:43.474 --> 03:47.183
- You know,
we're almost out of this stuff.

03:47.311 --> 03:51.020
Maybe I should trade the rest
of it for something good.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.888
Like, more wine.
- No.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.186
- You think there's more wine
in Haven?

03:55.319 --> 03:59.858
Or orange juice?
- Nathan.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.117
- Okay. I'll keep it.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.108
We could use the caffeine, right?

04:10.251 --> 04:11.616
He is coming back, Parker.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.367
- Okay so, why don't I go?

04:13.504 --> 04:16.962
Charlotte's note said that humans
don't last long in the Void.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.299
I can, 'cause I am not...
- Hey...

04:20.428 --> 04:24.387
what you are is Audrey Parker.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.675
And Audrey Parker
is not expendable.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.394
- Neither are you.

04:33.399 --> 04:36.061
Why don't we go together?

04:36.193 --> 04:39.060
You and I.
We make a good team.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.311
- Yeah, we do.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.155
But then who would watch
over Haven?

04:43.284 --> 04:47.618
And... let's be fair...
I'm a much faster runner.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.828
(knock at door)

04:49.957 --> 04:53.290
- Do you usually
get morning visitors?

04:53.419 --> 04:55.284
- No.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.841
It's about time.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.471
- Better late than never.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.769
Miss me?

05:21.322 --> 05:24.314
(somber folk music)

05:53.729 --> 05:56.471
- All the 3s have been played.
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.690
- Question is,
do you have a heart?

06:06.575 --> 06:08.657
Hm, of course you do.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.788
So, is the guard
gonna kill me?

06:14.917 --> 06:16.453
- What?
No.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.248
Of course not.

06:20.381 --> 06:23.293
- You have a terrible
poker face, brother.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.677
- You didn't hurt anyone, Dave.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.839
It was Croatoan.

06:27.972 --> 06:30.179
He possessed you to control.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.639
I don't know
what they plan to do with you.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.220
- Think we can stage
a jail break?

06:40.693 --> 06:43.651
- I wonder.

06:43.779 --> 06:44.734
- Where are you going?

06:44.863 --> 06:47.149
- To save your life.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.029
(door opens and shuts)

06:56.375 --> 06:58.957
(Nathan): So you're saying
no one remembers Haven?

06:59.086 --> 07:02.123
l pictured tanks
lined up around the border,

07:02.256 --> 07:04.247
everyone trying to figure out
how to get in.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.999
- No, out there this place
doesn't exist.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.924
Hailie didn't remember any of it
till she came through that fog

07:11.056 --> 07:13.593
and then
it all keeps flooding back.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.557
- So this is the first place
she wanted to go?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.062
- Yeah,
- Her family's old home.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.650
I'm glad you're here.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.770
- Thanks. Makes one of you.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.277
- I know. Audrey'll get there.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.445
Just give her some time.
- Yeah.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.529
Look, it wasn't easy convincing
Hailie to come back with me.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.949
You gonna tell me
why you need her so badly?

07:40.085 --> 07:41.586
- Charlotte.

07:41.712 --> 07:46.331
She finally figured out a plan
to end the Troubles once and for all.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.458
The last piece of the puzzle
is in the Void.

07:48.594 --> 07:51.256
Hailie's phasing Trouble
can get me in.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.507
- You want to go into the Void?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.017
Nathan, no.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.888
Tell Charlotte to find another way.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.686
- Can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

08:05.861 --> 08:08.352
She's dead?
- Yeah.

08:08.989 --> 08:13.528
Charlotte sacrificed her life
to give us this one shot.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.073
And I honestly believe
this is our only shot.

08:16.205 --> 08:20.949
- Nathan, when l was outside
the shroud, I had a-a...

08:22.753 --> 08:24.869
a vision.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.413
- Okay...

08:27.549 --> 08:30.916
- It was the future and Haven
was hell on Earth.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.260
Way worse than this
and it was all because

08:33.389 --> 08:36.756
you went into the Void
and didn't come back.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.804
I came here to prevent the apocalypse,
not help you start it.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.310
- A vision?

08:42.439 --> 08:44.179
-Yeah...

08:44.316 --> 08:46.693
and no peyote, no sweat lodge.

08:46.819 --> 08:49.185
Just some kind of Haven vision.

08:49.321 --> 08:53.439
And everything went to hell
because some Croatoan thing won.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.328
You know what I'm talking about.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.197
Well, at least
we know I'm not crazy.

09:02.334 --> 09:03.665
- No... no, you're not,

09:03.794 --> 09:07.286
but we don't have
any other options.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.334
- Are you listening to me?

09:09.466 --> 09:12.208
I came back here to stop you
from going into the Void.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.754
- In your vision,
everything went to hell

09:13.887 --> 09:15.502
because I didn't come back, right?

09:15.639 --> 09:19.473
- Yeah.
- So, make sure I come back.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.472
'Cause l have to go.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.122
- Been looking for you.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.340
Need to talk to you about Dave.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.423
What's all this?

09:57.556 --> 10:00.764
- Troubles.
l'm updating Charlotte's list.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.384
The Trouble census
she started when she came to Haven.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.762
She and Audrey added to it
when we were trapped in the school.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.857
I took it over
when Charlotte died.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.397
I'm falling a little behind.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.613
With all these Troubles
there's got to be something

10:16.742 --> 10:17.857
that can help us.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.653
Maybe we can cut the cord.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.824
Free Dave
from Croatoan's influence.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.336
- How can I help?

10:30.464 --> 10:31.954
- Start digging.

10:36.053 --> 10:39.966
- Okay, so you're saying
that I can phase through air,

10:40.641 --> 10:42.051
not just objects?

10:42.893 --> 10:44.929
- If you have this.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.012
I know it sounds crazy.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.482
- No crazier than completely
forgetting the town that I grew up in,

10:51.610 --> 10:55.023
or having a power
that lets me walk through walls.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.566
- Your Trouble does
something else too.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.194
If you hold that ring
and phase through the air,

11:04.039 --> 11:07.372
you create a temporary... doorway.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.417
A thin spot between worlds.
We call it a thinny.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.661
- A thinny?

11:12.881 --> 11:14.746
Really?
- We need something.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.044
It's on the other side of it.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.917
You're the only way we can get it.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.420
- I know it's a lot to take in.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.842
- No, it sounds pretty cool.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.844
Let's try it.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.552
- But not too far.
Just a couple of feet.

11:37.948 --> 11:41.111
- Holy! That was awesome!

11:41.952 --> 11:46.867
- When Barbara did it in 1983,
the thinny stayed open for a minute.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.284
- Barbara?

11:50.419 --> 11:51.875
You mean my mom?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.669
She could do this?

11:55.465 --> 11:58.502
- Yeah. She could.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.886
- Let me try something, okay?

12:17.529 --> 12:20.316
- Hailie, how are you keeping that open?

12:21.033 --> 12:24.366
- When I was a kid,
my mom was going out on a job

12:24.494 --> 12:26.075
and I begged her not to go.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.490
She said that she would always
come home safe

12:28.624 --> 12:30.831
as long as she stayed connected.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.916
I didn't realize that
she was talking about her Trouble.

12:34.046 --> 12:37.538
As long as | stay connected,
I think I can do this.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.335
- For how long?
- I don't know.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.381
This is my first thinny thingy.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.757
- She's struggling, she's not going to be
able to keep it open indefinitely.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.851
- She only needs to keep it open
long enough so I can get into the Void.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.594
- And come back.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.189
Hailie, do you think
you could do it again,

12:56.318 --> 12:59.810
let's say every two hours?

13:00.614 --> 13:02.900
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.991
- All right, so you go in,
you find the controller

13:06.119 --> 13:08.201
and then you wait for a thinny.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.696
We will be here waiting for you.
- Okay.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.823
- You act like you know what
you're gonna do once you're in there.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.622
- Trust me. I'll be winging it.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.876
The Barn imploded at Kick 'Em
Jenny Neck, 3.8 miles from here.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.123
I'll start there.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.511
- I know I keep saying this, but...

13:24.846 --> 13:27.713
come back to me, please.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.555
- You keep saying it,
I'll keep doing it.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.646
I know you hate long goodbyes.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.655
I'll be back, Parker.

13:45.784 --> 13:46.990
Promise.

15:44.569 --> 15:45.900
- How's Hailie?

15:48.365 --> 15:51.903
- Hailie is... she's fine.
She's resting.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.902
Opening that thinny took a bit out of her.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.744
- She shouldn't be doing this.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.953
She's impulsive and doesn't know
how to control her Trouble.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.995
She tell you why she came to Haven?

16:05.132 --> 16:08.295
- She said that she got into Trouble
with some bad people in Halifax.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.927
Wanted to lay low.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.753
She also mentioned
that you tried to kill her.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.307
- Yeah. I did.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.473
And she came back anyways.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.141
Now, does that strike you

16:22.274 --> 16:24.936
as someone who's capable
of making sound decisions?

16:25.610 --> 16:28.397
- I can't believe that you're
the one that's getting angry.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.900
lf anyone's gonna be angry,
it ought to be me.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.196
- Oh, really?
- You left, Duke.

16:35.328 --> 16:39.037
You just walked away
right when we needed you most.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.747
- Yeah, when you needed me,

16:40.876 --> 16:42.867
'cause you and Nathan
always need me.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.836
Well, now you got Hailie
in your tool belt. Congratulations.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.580
- The only reason
you care about Hailie

16:48.717 --> 16:51.550
is because if anything
happens to her, it's on you.

16:52.387 --> 16:55.094
All these people
in Haven that you abandoned,

16:55.223 --> 16:56.963
they're on you too, Duke.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.638
- What do you want, Audrey?
I came back, didn't I?

17:00.770 --> 17:04.183
- So what? You want a medal
for doing the right thing?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.269
- And using Hailie?

17:08.111 --> 17:09.442
Is that the right thing?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.480
You know, if I had known
that this is why

17:13.617 --> 17:16.575
you wanted me to bring a member
of the Colton family back to Haven,

17:17.287 --> 17:19.448
I never would've come back.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.702
- Why did you come back, Duke?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.789
It's not just because
Nathan wrote a letter.

17:28.465 --> 17:33.755
- You know, it turns out
that I can't escape this place.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.263
l'm tied to it, just like you.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.969
- You and l are nothing alike.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.810
I care about people.

17:57.911 --> 17:58.946
- Remember me?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.660
From the Gull?

18:07.629 --> 18:10.291
- Lisa, right? Let's just talk.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.874
I don't know about you,
but I could use a drink.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.878
- My little brother told me he saw you.
I didn't want to believe him.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.131
Ever since you did this to me,
I've got to wear these all the time.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.974
Wouldn't want to accidentally
blow up someone

18:23.103 --> 18:27.016
like I did my boyfriend.
You remember that, right?

18:27.148 --> 18:29.560
- Lisa, you can't hurt me.

18:36.950 --> 18:41.193
I told you, you can't hurt me
with your Trouble. l'm immune.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.205
- What if I blow the whole place up?
You immune to that?

18:54.217 --> 18:56.208
- Lisa, no!

18:58.013 --> 18:59.719
- Julia Silver.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.931
According to the census,
she has an exorcism Trouble.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.435
Maybe we could use it

19:04.561 --> 19:09.021
to eradicate Croatoan's influence
over Dave. Drive out the demon.

19:10.317 --> 19:14.151
Oh. She's dead. That's two.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.608
- Two people with Troubles
that might have been able to end

19:17.741 --> 19:20.608
Croatoan's possession of Dave,
and they're both dead.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.700
Out of the thousands of records
that we've scoured.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.241
- We will find something.
- Look, Vince.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.617
I'm not blaming Dave for what
happened to Charlotte and the others.

19:29.753 --> 19:33.245
| get that Croatoan possessed him when he
came through that door in the cave, but...

19:36.676 --> 19:41.261
- Dave and l have always
understood one thing.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.593
That we are charged
with protecting this town.

19:44.726 --> 19:48.969
Since before you were born,
my brother and l

19:49.105 --> 19:50.936
have been prepared
to lay down our lives

19:51.066 --> 19:53.557
in service
of that responsibility.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.479
So yes, Dwight,

19:55.612 --> 19:58.570
if killing Dave is the only way
to defeat Croatoan

19:58.698 --> 20:04.068
and save Haven,
I will be the one to do it.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.195
But we're not there yet.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.721
Oh, what's this?

20:27.268 --> 20:28.303
- Boyd Davis?

20:28.436 --> 20:31.849
- He has a reincarnation Trouble,
the same one Duke tried to use

20:31.981 --> 20:34.188
when Audrey was trapped inside Mara.

20:34.317 --> 20:37.605
- But that's the Trouble that split them
into two people, Mara and Audrey.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.602
lf Croatoan's possessing Dave,
we have no idea

20:39.739 --> 20:41.195
what will come out
if we try to split them.

20:41.324 --> 20:45.533
- Whatever it is, it might not be able
to live long outside of Dave's body.

20:45.662 --> 20:49.780
It could be like cutting out a cancer.
- It could be anything, Vince.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.157
This is the greatest threat
this town has ever faced.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.794
We could be putting
Croatoan right out in the open.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.956
- Which is right
where we want him, Dwight.

20:56.089 --> 21:01.300
Whatever form he takes once he's outside
of Dave, we can kill him.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.508
- You gotta be kidding me.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.267
- William.
- Ha ha.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.273
The only thing
that could be more satisfying

22:03.406 --> 22:06.773
is if I'd been able to kick you
into that hole myself.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.490
- You want to help me out of here?
- A gun?

22:11.623 --> 22:14.285
Oh, you really don't know
how it works here, do you?

22:14.417 --> 22:17.375
You're in the Void, Nate.
You're between worlds.

22:17.504 --> 22:21.042
This is the place for everything
that doesn't belong anywhere else.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.756
Moving parts, machines,
they don't work here.

22:24.636 --> 22:25.751
If you want to kill someone,

22:26.304 --> 22:28.340
you have to do it
with your bare hands.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.964
- Is that what you laid this trap for?

22:32.101 --> 22:33.432
- I don't like visitors.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.477
You don't believe me?

22:37.815 --> 22:38.770
Shoot.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.361
(clicking)

22:42.487 --> 22:43.818
Told you so.

22:45.657 --> 22:47.113
So, how'd you get here?

22:51.829 --> 22:54.866
- Mara... sent me.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.990
- She banished you?

22:57.126 --> 22:58.036
I love it.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.545
That's... so where is it?

22:59.671 --> 23:02.128
Where's the thinny
she sent you through?

23:03.716 --> 23:05.456
- Listen to me, William.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.634
Mara sent me to find you.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.471
Croatoan is in Haven.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.760
Mara said we need something
from the old Barn.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.182
A controller.

23:22.860 --> 23:27.399
- Why would you want to help Mara?
I doubt you two hit it off.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.068
- We didn't.
- Oh, that's my girl.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.282
- But everyone's lives are at stake.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.402
Mara's life is at stake.

23:34.372 --> 23:35.908
Which means Audrey's is too.

23:36.040 --> 23:36.995
- Audrey?

23:37.417 --> 23:39.032
Audrey's gone, fella.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.625
I spent 500 years getting Mara out,

23:41.754 --> 23:44.291
and even if there is a fraction
of Audrey still left in there,

23:44.424 --> 23:47.086
there is no way that Mara's
letting her come to the surface.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.709
No way.
- Audrey is still in there.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.507
And I am gonna get her out.

23:52.682 --> 23:55.799
| just need to find where the old Barn
crashed, that's why I need you.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.345
- Yeah, I get why you need me.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.263
Why do I need you, exactly?

24:02.525 --> 24:04.026
- You said it yourself.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.188
I know where the thinny is.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.690
Without me, you're trapped here.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.239
So we need to work together

24:12.368 --> 24:16.702
or Croatoan is gonna kill Mara
and everyone else in Haven.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.243
So are you gonna help me or not?

24:30.428 --> 24:31.713
- Lisa, please.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.337
Look, I know
what happened to you sucks.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.261
But lots of people have learned
to live with their Troubles.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.600
You can too.
- Live with the Troubles?

24:39.729 --> 24:44.098
Look at me. Do you have any idea
what it's been like since that fog went up?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.098
We're all trapped here in this hell hole.

24:46.235 --> 24:49.102
These tough guys with tattoos,
they tell you where you can go.

24:49.238 --> 24:52.105
They... they ration food,
supplies, electricity.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.608
There's even someone using a Trouble
to power the sewage plant.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.281
- I don't think
I want to know how that works.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.371
- You think this is a joke?
Look at what you did to me!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.536
And what about everyone else
you cursed?

25:02.669 --> 25:03.829
People are dead.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.873
Thousands of lives
are ruined because of you.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.746
- And I'm sorry for that, Lisa.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.293
| feel terrible for every single
person that l have hurt.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.420
I carry it with me everywhere that | go.

25:15.556 --> 25:18.013
- And what, I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?

25:18.142 --> 25:23.637
- No. You are supposed to feel
everything that you're feeling.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.809
- These people that you hurt,

25:30.154 --> 25:32.270
I bet you don't even know
who they are.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.485
- I don't.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.119
- I want to tell you.

25:37.954 --> 25:41.538
Don't try anything.
Just listen.

25:42.291 --> 25:46.034
Before you and I both die,

25:46.170 --> 25:48.502
someone needs
to tell you what you've done.

25:54.637 --> 25:57.049
- So, we're not even gonna talk?

25:57.181 --> 25:59.092
- That'd be my preference, yeah.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.841
- Lame.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.094
So Mara, how is she?

26:04.230 --> 26:05.345
- Fine.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.017
- She miss me?
- Yes.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.856
- I bet, with you
as a conversationalist.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.600
You want to play a game?
What?

26:10.737 --> 26:13.444
You never passed the time on a long
road trip by playing a game?

26:13.573 --> 26:17.111
I got one. It's a good one. How about
I give you three hints about a Trouble

26:17.243 --> 26:20.030
that Mara and | created, and
you have to guess which one it is.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.199
Fun, and educational.
- You want to talk?

26:22.331 --> 26:25.289
Tell me about Croatoan.
- You tell me. You said he's in Haven.

26:25.418 --> 26:28.285
- He is. But not in physical form.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.377
He's taken control of someone.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.210
- And you're okay, for now?

26:33.342 --> 26:34.718
- No, we are not okay.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.675
He has killed a lot of people.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.968
- Ah, a few people's nothing.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.386
lf Mara doesn't stop him,
he's gonna lay waste

26:43.519 --> 26:45.635
to your entire town
and everyone you love.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.182
You see this place?

26:48.024 --> 26:50.515
Your whole world
can become the next Void.

26:52.862 --> 26:56.730
(coughs)
How are you feeling?

26:58.701 --> 27:00.783
- Fine.
- Not for long.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.573
Humans don't do well
in the Void.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.867
But you knew that, right?

27:07.752 --> 27:10.710
Maybe you should tell me
where the thinny is in case you,

27:11.380 --> 27:14.213
you know, croak before
we make it back.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.811
- How much further?

27:28.940 --> 27:32.558
- Oh, so now it wants to talk?

27:34.237 --> 27:36.228
We're almost there.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.908
- What is all this?

27:44.247 --> 27:48.581
- This is what's left
of the Barn, before it died.

27:50.753 --> 27:52.960
- When I was in it,
it was just a white room.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.455
- Got to stop thinking about it
like a thing.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.843
Technology is different
from yours.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.676
This is all a construct,

28:00.805 --> 28:03.342
and the underlying technology
isn't wood.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.844
It looks like this
because this is the form

28:05.977 --> 28:07.683
it was programmed to take.

28:07.812 --> 28:10.770
- Mara said the controller would
look out of place in a Barn.

28:11.482 --> 28:13.859
So we're not looking
for something made of wood.

28:14.527 --> 28:17.610
- We're not looking
for any element from your world.

28:18.990 --> 28:22.653
Funny.
I've been here before.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.618
Never figured there was anything
of value.

28:38.718 --> 28:39.924
Oh, that's it.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.234
You said Mara's in Haven, right?
- Yeah.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.985
- Then who is that?

29:11.334 --> 29:12.494
- Boyd?

29:16.172 --> 29:18.754
Boyd?
- Where is he?

29:19.508 --> 29:20.918
- Anyone home?

29:21.719 --> 29:24.882
- Why are we here?
What are you gonna do to me?

29:25.014 --> 29:28.222
- Dave, we don't want to hurt you.
- Just stay calm.

29:28.351 --> 29:31.843
If this works, you'll be free
of Croatoan's influence.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.065
- Boyd?

29:35.191 --> 29:38.524
Boyd, l'm Dwight Hendrickson.
We spoke earlier?

29:42.031 --> 29:45.194
- Sorry, Haven's not
the same town I grew up in.

29:45.743 --> 29:49.656
I'm a little jumpy these days.
- Thanks for agreeing to help us.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.246
- Don't know about using
Troubles like tools.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.911
I never had one till recently.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.580
But they always looked like something
you don't want to mess with.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.795
- Generally speaking, you don't,
but Troubles can sometimes be useful.

29:59.924 --> 30:03.792
Yours has been used to help someone
before. Saved their life.

30:03.928 --> 30:05.964
- Do you know what emotion
activates your Trouble?

30:06.097 --> 30:07.928
- Oh, I don't know.

30:08.057 --> 30:13.051
The only time it ever happened
before I was driving my truck and l, uh...

30:14.897 --> 30:16.398
- Dave, Dave!

30:20.820 --> 30:23.436
- Dave, stop!

30:59.316 --> 31:00.692
- What happened?

31:03.070 --> 31:05.982
- The darkness was the worst part.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.822
Anyone caught out of the light died.

31:08.951 --> 31:11.488
They were flayed to the bone.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.656
There were so many people killed.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.326
Husbands lost wives.
Mothers lost daughters.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.745
And you managed to miss
every awful part of it.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.493
- Do you know
why I missed it all?

31:20.629 --> 31:21.835
- Because you don't care!

31:25.926 --> 31:27.882
I can't change that.

31:28.012 --> 31:32.881
But I left because I didn't think
that I could help any of them.

31:33.601 --> 31:37.890
That I would only make things worse.
And I was afraid of that.

31:39.190 --> 31:42.899
- Don't be afraid, Duke.
- Lisa.

31:43.027 --> 31:46.064
- You're never going to make
anything worse ever again.

31:46.197 --> 31:47.812
- Lisa?

31:47.948 --> 31:49.529
- Audrey, get out of here.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.149
If she touches the ground,
this whole place is coming down.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.322
- Lisa.
- Don't!

31:54.455 --> 31:56.992
- Just breathe.
It's gonna be okay.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.830
- He Troubled me, he's a monster!

31:58.959 --> 32:00.745
- He's not a monster.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.629
(Audrey): Just listen to me.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.333
I know that you're mad at Duke.

32:05.466 --> 32:09.550
I know that he hurt you,
but he didn't mean to.

32:09.678 --> 32:14.138
He came back to Haven to save you.
- What do you mean?

32:16.018 --> 32:20.102
- He came back to Haven
to save all of us.

32:20.231 --> 32:23.769
Here. I can prove it.

32:27.363 --> 32:28.603
Just”

32:36.413 --> 32:38.369
Come on.

32:43.754 --> 32:45.619
- What is she?

32:45.756 --> 32:47.792
- Template? I don't know.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.751
- Parker...
- Stand back.

32:51.887 --> 32:55.379
- We mean no harm.

32:56.058 --> 32:59.471
- What do you want?
- Something from the Barn.

33:01.397 --> 33:03.058
That.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.226
The controller.

33:07.236 --> 33:08.601
- Why?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.728
- Someone is killing our friends.

33:11.949 --> 33:15.862
Trying to destroy everything we care about.
We need it to defeat them.

33:16.579 --> 33:22.245
To defeat the... great evil.
Croatoan.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.919
- What you seek
is an incredible power

33:27.631 --> 33:31.123
that can only be given
to the right person.

33:31.594 --> 33:36.088
Otherwise,
it must be destroyed.

33:37.308 --> 33:40.095
- How do | prove to her that
one of us is the right person?

33:40.686 --> 33:42.096
- I don't know.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.599
- Why was the Barn created?

33:45.149 --> 33:48.016
- To punish Mara
for creating the Troubles.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.518
- That answer is incorrect.

33:50.654 --> 33:53.521
The controller must be
destroyed.

33:53.657 --> 33:57.866
Ten, nine, eight,

33:57.995 --> 34:02.284
seven, six, five...

34:03.459 --> 34:05.495
FOUL”
- Wait, that's not my answer.

34:05.628 --> 34:06.743
l have a different answer...
- Three...

34:06.879 --> 34:09.461
- The Barn wasn't created to punish Mara,
it was created to save her.

34:09.590 --> 34:10.955
- Two.

34:16.305 --> 34:17.511
Elaborate.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.130
- What are you doing?

34:21.644 --> 34:24.135
- Mara was lost, misguided.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.141
The Barn wasn't made to punish her.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.772
She needed to see
where she went wrong.

34:29.526 --> 34:31.187
To learn from her mistakes.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.647
Mara wasn't born evil.

34:37.368 --> 34:39.450
She was capable of so much more.

34:40.162 --> 34:42.323
Of being better.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.284
Of being like...

34:46.710 --> 34:47.995
Audrey Parker.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.665
- You are the right person.

35:15.406 --> 35:21.026
- Why did you keep talking
about Mara in the past tense?

35:24.665 --> 35:25.871
- What?

35:26.709 --> 35:29.451
l was just telling her
what she needed to hear.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.541
- No.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.588
And the way you talk about Audrey Parker.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.509
You got her back, didn't you?

35:40.472 --> 35:41.723
- What?

35:42.516 --> 35:45.508
- It won't work.
I got Mara out before.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.894
And I can do it again.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.759
- This is Hailie.

36:18.427 --> 36:21.635
Duke brought her here to Haven
to help all of us.

36:21.764 --> 36:25.131
Are you ready?
It's been two hours.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.098
It's okay.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.269
- What is she doing?

36:38.405 --> 36:41.442
- It's a door... to another place.

36:41.575 --> 36:43.566
My partner, Nathan,
is there right now.

36:43.702 --> 36:44.782
And when he comes back,

36:44.912 --> 36:48.746
we are going to be able
to end the Troubles forever.

36:49.249 --> 36:50.910
Think about that, Lisa.

36:52.086 --> 36:54.793
You won't have
to be like this anymore.

36:54.922 --> 36:58.790
Everyone will be normal again.

36:58.926 --> 37:02.293
You can hate Duke
for what he did to you,

37:02.429 --> 37:04.294
but it isn't his fault.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.594
This, coming back to Haven

37:07.726 --> 37:11.218
to try and help us
fix the Troubles, that was a choice.

37:14.108 --> 37:18.522
Duke and l, we... we're alike.

37:18.654 --> 37:22.192
We're both tied to Haven.

37:22.324 --> 37:25.532
He came back
because he cares about all of us.

37:27.621 --> 37:30.033
Even if we forget that sometimes.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.467
- Audrey!

37:44.096 --> 37:45.176
- Nathan?

37:54.398 --> 37:56.559
Lisa, Nathan's coming.

37:56.692 --> 37:59.058
We're gonna end the Troubles,
I promise.

38:00.195 --> 38:01.731
- I'm sorry.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.526
- Things are gonna get
better for you.

38:06.410 --> 38:10.494
I want you to tell your little brother
he's got one hell of an arm.

38:17.421 --> 38:21.255
- Are you okay?
Hailie, you have to keep it open.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.627
- No. I don't.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.259
- What do you mean, no?

38:30.392 --> 38:33.384
Nathan is right on the other side of that.
You have to hold the thinny open for him.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.101
- Why, so he can come back
and cure the Troubles?

38:35.230 --> 38:37.186
- Yes, isn't that what you want?
- Are you serious?

38:37.316 --> 38:38.647
Have you seen what I can do?

38:38.775 --> 38:41.812
Why on Earth would I want
to give that up?

38:56.168 --> 39:00.411
- I know that what you can do
seems incredible, but it is a Trouble.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.162
It is not a power.

39:02.299 --> 39:03.914
- Says you.

39:04.051 --> 39:07.760
lf Nathan comes back and cures
everyone, then what am I?

39:07.888 --> 39:11.255
Just another girl
with no family, no money.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.723
I am nothing.
- You are not nothing.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.810
You have seen what the Troubles
have done to Haven.

39:16.939 --> 39:20.648
You grew up here.
It used to be a nice, quiet little town.

39:20.776 --> 39:24.234
It was a safe place, and now look at it.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.695
You don't want it to be
like this forever, do you?

39:26.823 --> 39:29.735
- I will not give up my power.

39:53.976 --> 39:56.308
- Hailie, you can't do this.
- Actually, I can.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.768
I'm gonna rob banks,
I'm gonna buy myself an island

39:58.897 --> 40:00.853
and get me some of those fancy drinks

40:00.983 --> 40:02.769
with the little umbrellas on them.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.445
- Hailie, stop!

40:17.082 --> 40:18.947
Nathan!

40:24.965 --> 40:26.830
- No!

40:45.861 --> 40:48.773
- Poor Boyd.
- Croatoan knew exactly what we were doing.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.282
- It's like he can see the world
through Dave.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.114
How are we supposed to stop him?

40:53.243 --> 40:55.950
We can never talk to Dave,
plan with Dave.

40:56.079 --> 40:59.697
It's like they're sharing one mind now.
- Maybe we can use that.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.911
What if Dave could confront Croatoan

41:02.044 --> 41:04.706
on equal footing
from inside his mind somehow?

41:05.213 --> 41:08.250
- The Croatoan talked to Dave once
while Dave was having a vision.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.214
So obviously, they can interact.

41:10.344 --> 41:12.710
- But how do we get him
in there to face him?

41:17.601 --> 41:21.310
- We hypnotize Dave.
Get him to go into his own mind.

41:21.438 --> 41:24.601
Cast out Croatoan and destroy him.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.224
This is a job for the Iron Maiden.

41:29.571 --> 41:31.562
(coughing)

41:48.965 --> 41:50.045
- What did you do?

41:50.175 --> 41:52.882
- Please, think I want to be
stuck here with you?

41:53.011 --> 41:55.172
That thinny was my ticket
out of here.

41:56.473 --> 41:58.759
Don't pretend
you don't love this.

42:00.268 --> 42:01.474
- I kind of do.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.969
- So what's the plan now?

42:04.106 --> 42:05.471
You gonna kill me?

42:05.607 --> 42:07.518
We both know that's not you.

42:09.444 --> 42:13.437
- No, you're not worth it.
I'm taking this back to Haven.

42:13.907 --> 42:16.819
And I'm leaving you here to die.

42:33.176 --> 42:37.636
- Well. Looks like we're settling in.
