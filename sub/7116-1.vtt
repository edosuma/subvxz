00:04.530 --> 00:15.470
Hey,hey,hey,hey Oohh,ooh

00:15.480 --> 00:18.600
Won't you come see about me?

00:18.860 --> 00:21.660
I'll be alone dancing

00:21.770 --> 00:23.380
You know it,baby

00:24.040 --> 00:27.340
Tell me your troubles and doubts

00:27.580 --> 00:31.400
Giving me everything inside and out

00:31.680 --> 00:36.650
And don't you forget about me

00:38.800 --> 00:40.810
Don't,don't,don't,don't

Victorious S03E01 The Breakfast Bunch

00:48.880 --> 00:51.100
well,this is a great way to spend a Saturday.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.020
I have never had detention before.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.000
I'm kind of nervous.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.900
if you hadn't made us late for class,

00:56.900 --> 00:57.740
We wouldn't be here.

00:57.810 --> 01:00.780
I was choking on a pretzel!

01:00.780 --> 01:03.390
well, why do you always gotta be chokin' on something'?

01:03.390 --> 01:04.650
ah,give him a break.

01:04.660 --> 01:05.650
yeah, it's not robbie's fault

01:05.660 --> 01:08.090
He has a petite throat.

01:08.090 --> 01:11.960
it's average!

01:11.960 --> 01:14.400
hey,who's in charge of detention anyway?

01:14.400 --> 01:15.430
vice principal--

01:15.430 --> 01:18.070
Dickers.

01:18.070 --> 01:22.200
mornin' waz-bags.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.340
Detention is that way --

01:24.340 --> 01:26.570
In the library.

01:26.580 --> 01:30.980
Get ready for the worst day of your lives.

01:30.980 --> 01:32.480
yay!

01:32.480 --> 01:34.450
We're at school on a Saturday!

01:34.450 --> 01:37.050
Ha ha ha ha...

01:37.050 --> 01:38.690
library!

01:38.690 --> 01:39.350
okay.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.000
geez.

01:40.100 --> 01:40.670
calm down.

01:44.490 --> 01:45.930
well,well.

01:45.930 --> 01:49.300
It's 7:06 a.M. here in los angeles.

01:49.300 --> 01:54.000
That means in australia, it's yesterday.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.540
Or tomorrow.

01:56.540 --> 01:58.150
You know, in Australia.

01:58.150 --> 02:00.600
When you flash the toilet, the water swirls backwdsds.

02:00.740 --> 02:06.310
Put a socket in, alfro. You clowns are gonna sit here

02:06.320 --> 02:09.830
all day and think about why you're in detention.

02:15.190 --> 02:19.260
- Now, cellphones, let's have them.  - Why?

02:19.260 --> 02:22.400
Because in detentions, there are no phone calls.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.200
- What about texting?  - No!

02:24.200 --> 02:26.270
- Email?  - No!

02:26.270 --> 02:31.310
- Can we play grumpy gerbils?  - I love grumpy gerbils.

02:31.310 --> 02:34.510
I can't get pass level twenty-three.

02:34.510 --> 02:38.580
- Sip it, corn pie! - Can we have corn pie?

02:38.580 --> 02:42.750
Shut up! Phones!

02:50.000 --> 02:54.200
Now, I'm gonna put your box of phones right here.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.390
What, princess?

02:59.240 --> 03:01.540
I am just wondering what the plan is for lunch.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.770
Well, if you pretends to get hungry,

03:04.780 --> 03:08.940
There's a big plane of tuna right here.

03:08.950 --> 03:12.380
Uh,techinically sir. If perishable foods aren't kept

03:12.380 --> 03:15.990
either below 34 degrees or above 140 degrees--

03:16.050 --> 03:17.670
Pipe outside, salad.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.510
Eat the tuna or starve. I can care less.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.840
um,I think you mean you couldn't care less.

03:27.000 --> 03:27.740
what's that?

03:28.110 --> 03:30.290
You said you could care less

03:30.830 --> 03:32.870
which implies that you do care.

03:32.870 --> 03:33.940
At least a little bit.

03:33.940 --> 03:34.940
I don't.

03:35.610 --> 03:38.750
well,then you should've said you couldn't care less.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.050
but you did not.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.270
Hey, what about the guy who first landed on the moon?

03:44.410 --> 03:46.870
He said "One small step for man."

03:46.970 --> 03:49.460
I wanna just say "Oh my god, I'm on the moon!"

03:51.190 --> 03:52.960
All right, not another word.

03:53.310 --> 03:54.020
Word.

03:54.260 --> 03:56.270
That's it, West.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.500
You just bought yourself for another Saturday detention.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.960
did I get a good deal on it?

04:00.070 --> 04:01.980
You just bought yourself another one!!!

04:03.390 --> 04:05.610
Look, I am sorry. I apologize.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.410
That's three. Three saturdays.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.420
But she was apologizing.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.250
okay, vega, now you got one.

04:12.250 --> 04:12.920
Why?

04:13.040 --> 04:14.200
boom! Another one!

04:14.200 --> 04:15.480
I don't want another one.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.660
that's three! You wanna try for four?

04:17.660 --> 04:18.570
I really don't.

04:18.570 --> 04:20.519
That's four. You want five?

04:20.660 --> 04:21.260
yes.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.670
Ok, Vega. You just got five!

04:23.680 --> 04:27.180
- What?  - Tori.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.120
Stop what? Jade said yes!

04:29.270 --> 04:31.430
I guess he's afraid to get warm the rabbit.

04:32.900 --> 04:33.750
oh yeah?

04:34.050 --> 04:36.670
I got one for you too! Fudge sack!

04:38.160 --> 04:41.490
Anybody else? Huh?

04:41.490 --> 04:46.460
Anybody? You mess with the cow...

04:46.470 --> 04:47.660
You get the udders.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.630

05:56.330 --> 05:59.870
- How you know? - I felt ya, dawg.

05:59.870 --> 06:02.600
Tacos do sound really good right now.

06:02.610 --> 06:07.780
- Put up for tacos.  - yeah, I love tacos.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.540
Look who's been reeeaaal quiet.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.420
I am just not that hungry right now.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.780
Yeah, why do you tell everyone the truth?

06:16.790 --> 06:19.550
- Leave me alone.  - What's goin' on here?

06:24.090 --> 06:28.800
Our pristine little friend cat has never had a taco.

06:28.930 --> 06:33.050
I'm not that pristine. Wait what's pristine mean?

06:35.130 --> 06:38.330
are you a vegan?

06:42.490 --> 06:43.780
Knock it off, guys.

06:43.780 --> 06:45.080
What's a vegan?

06:45.080 --> 06:47.100
It's a person who doesn't eat meat.

06:47.430 --> 06:48.200
I love meat.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.010
don't shush me.

06:51.020 --> 06:55.260
Come on, Cat. Tell us.

06:55.260 --> 06:58.590
Have you ever had a crispy corn shell...

06:58.590 --> 07:02.830
full of meat, lettuce...

07:02.830 --> 07:04.610
Shredded cheese...

07:11.340 --> 07:14.210
Hey, leave her alone.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.450
What do you gonna do if I don't?

07:17.410 --> 07:21.350
Oh I just might go online... To the slap...

07:21.350 --> 07:24.790
- And unfriend you.  -Oh really?

07:25.890 --> 07:30.120
Two clicks. One to unfriend you.

07:30.130 --> 07:34.890
And one to confirm that I am really wanna unfriend you.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.900
Hey, come on y'all. How are we gonna get some tacos?

07:42.200 --> 07:44.440
I can call Trina. Ask her to pick some up

07:44.440 --> 07:45.530
and leave it in my locker.

07:45.670 --> 07:47.620
You're so conceited, Tori.

07:48.970 --> 07:50.100
You're so conceited

07:53.640 --> 07:54.600
... What?

08:38.380 --> 08:39.140

08:54.050 --> 08:55.420
Okay.

09:10.620 --> 09:16.190
Tacos. The girl has tacos. They're tacos.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.470
Do you approve of this?

10:00.860 --> 10:01.840
whoa,whoa,whoa,

10:03.380 --> 10:04.320
The floor is wet.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.760
You can't run across that. It's too dangerous.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.450
Way to go, Tori. You just had to have your taco.

10:14.450 --> 10:20.140
- We're dead.  - No... Just me.

10:24.410 --> 10:27.340
- You guys get back to the library. - What about you?

10:27.540 --> 10:30.500
- I am gonna get Dickers' attention. - How?

10:31.180 --> 10:34.720
Here I am once again

10:36.760 --> 10:39.910
You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action.

10:40.110 --> 10:43.800
You're never gonna fade you'll be the main attraction

10:45.950 --> 10:47.670
Just remember me

10:47.670 --> 10:50.000
Well, I'll make it shine.

10:52.850 --> 10:55.540
oh, I'm gonna make it shine.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.550
I'm gonna make it shine real good.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.100
- Listen. - ahhhh,

11:02.100 --> 11:03.100
You're in big trouble, Vega.

11:03.840 --> 11:04.990
for what?

11:04.990 --> 11:07.230
For leaving the library. Skinny-jeans.

11:08.540 --> 11:12.060
And sing it off key. Come on!

11:12.430 --> 11:16.600
I was running and singing at the same time! That's really hard.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.100
oh, shut up!

11:28.420 --> 11:30.060
That's the last time, Vega.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.020
That's the last time you run around these halls

11:33.020 --> 11:34.380
singing about making things shine.

11:36.910 --> 11:37.800
I'm sorry.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.200
You watch that mouth.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.260

11:41.990 --> 11:45.900
You know what you're gonna be five years from now?

11:45.900 --> 11:48.610
You're gonna be a big pop star.

11:48.610 --> 11:51.960
that... Sounds pretty cool.

11:52.010 --> 11:55.990
Ok, Miss pop star. See if you can pop this!

11:57.580 --> 11:59.380
Is that an arm pimple?

11:59.380 --> 12:00.620
that's right.

12:00.830 --> 12:04.930
Go ahead, pop star. Pop it. Pop my arm pimple.

12:06.340 --> 12:07.220
Eww.

12:09.490 --> 12:10.080

12:21.930 --> 12:24.690
Sorry... Just tryin' to kill that fly.

12:55.230 --> 12:56.490
What I miss?

12:58.020 --> 12:58.950

12:59.240 --> 13:03.010

13:03.010 --> 13:06.960
- Oh, still warm. - They were in robbie's pants.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.230
can you not say that again?

13:13.090 --> 13:16.500
Cat, you're not eating your taco.

13:18.020 --> 13:23.350
yeah,it's 'cuz I'm like, I am too excited to eat it. Y'know?

13:23.350 --> 13:25.340
Tacos, yeah.

13:28.200 --> 13:28.980
vegan.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.370
I am not.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.700
then eat your taco if you're not a vegan.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.460
why do you have to be so mean sometimes.

13:35.460 --> 13:35.970
I know,right?

13:35.970 --> 13:39.720
I am just honest. Unlike some people here.

13:43.130 --> 13:43.900
What?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.130
why aren't you eating your taco, Robbie.

13:46.140 --> 13:50.370
you know, I am just getting ready.

13:53.610 --> 14:00.210
maybe we have another vegan among us.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.780
I'm not a vegan. I had taco lots of times.

14:03.590 --> 14:06.330
ever had a taco around here?

14:08.940 --> 14:12.440
ohhh -- you shared a taco with Tori.

14:13.370 --> 14:14.940
what are you guys talking about?

14:14.950 --> 14:16.080
nothin, nothing!

14:18.430 --> 14:20.930
Robbie's trying to tell me that sometimes,

14:21.070 --> 14:24.840
You and he crounch the corn shell together.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.430
I didn't say that.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.820
did you or did you not motion to Tori.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.990
yeah but only cause I didn't want

14:33.990 --> 14:36.120
Tori to know I'm a vegan, okay?

14:37.990 --> 14:41.870
hey, robbie... I'll try one if you will.

14:53.270 --> 14:58.020
Oh, man. These tacos. It's got me pumped!

15:04.010 --> 15:05.610
I think he's gonna run dance.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.130
give her some hot sauce.

16:32.260 --> 16:36.390
I tell you,chicks cannot hold their hot sauce.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.060
are we gonna be just like our parents?

17:00.060 --> 17:09.550
- When you get old, you buy sags - And you can't find your pants

17:11.900 --> 17:14.750
sometimes I feel so much pressure.

17:15.430 --> 17:16.910
You know,with my music.

17:17.650 --> 17:19.550
My counsin JJ is always telling me,

17:19.740 --> 17:23.400
"You gotta be the best. You gotta be number one. Number one!"

17:25.030 --> 17:27.440
And I wanna tell him, hey man, get off my chiz.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.670
But he drives me to school,

17:28.820 --> 17:30.570
and I don't wanna blow my ride.

17:33.630 --> 17:35.610
I have a weird talent

17:37.490 --> 17:41.040
So conceited,tori. You're so conceited.

Ok, ok. I'll show you.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.040
I can't believe I'm doing this...

18:18.150 --> 18:20.430
that was amazing.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.200
You learn that from your daddy?

18:25.930 --> 18:28.630
Your daddy know how to shoot a bow and arrow with his foot?

18:31.100 --> 18:32.370
I'm sorry, did I miss something?

18:34.600 --> 18:37.550

18:43.140 --> 18:43.950

18:44.140 --> 18:46.330
Cause my dad can't do anything with his feet!

18:46.330 --> 18:48.900
That is not my fault.

18:48.990 --> 18:49.850
stop it!!!

18:51.700 --> 18:54.950
As teenagers,we are all under too much pressure!!!

19:15.110 --> 19:15.770
Robbie.

20:17.490 --> 20:18.470
