01:23.900 --> 01:26.600
Damn, I wish you'd let me
take you on a bit further.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.700
You've already gone too far off
your route these past couple of days.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.600
But thank you.

01:33.700 --> 01:37.300
It's generous folk like yourself
keeping our nation great.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.300
I don't know what I'd have done
if you hadn't come along.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.300
I was all bottled up.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.800
Damn close to doin' something.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.100
I know that.

01:49.200 --> 01:53.300
And I hope those thoughts
are nothin' but distant memories now.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.200
It's taken every bit of my strength...

01:57.300 --> 01:59.500
but I finally believe you're right.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.900
Don't worry, friend.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.300
We'll meet again someplace.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.700
I just know it.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.400
God bless.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.700
Did I ever tell you why
I love livin' in Memphis?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.400
You can go further north, south,
east or west...

02:40.500 --> 02:43.500
but you cannot get
any closer to heaven.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.200
You know, that's kind of poetic.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.400
But then what man has ever had
a muse like you?

02:50.500 --> 02:51.900
Say yes again.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.300
You have no idea how perfect
that sounds off your lips.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.300
Yes.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.600
How do you want
to spend the day, Bea?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.300
A little drive?

03:47.700 --> 03:49.700
Sounds good to me.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.800
Back away from the car.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.600
Son...

06:36.000 --> 06:38.500
I gotta tell you...

06:38.500 --> 06:44.400
this car is one of the more beautiful
sights I've seen in a long time.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.300
The 1959 convertible
is the finest machine...

06:48.300 --> 06:50.300
Cadillac ever built.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.100
Titanic V-8...

06:55.100 --> 06:57.700
390 cubic inches...

06:57.800 --> 06:59.900
345 horses.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.400
The cream of American history.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.900
You best take care of this one.
She's runnin' hot...

07:13.000 --> 07:14.900
and it's a mean sun today.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.400
This car keeps no secrets from me.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.200
Maybe we could share some secrets
of our own.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.500
The name's Elvis.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.900
I'm tryin' to find my way to Memphis.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.900
I got a dinner date this Sunday.

07:35.900 --> 07:39.600
And I'm being reeled back home
like a floppin' catfish.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.500
Man, I can't tell you how it excites me
to see folks haven't forgotten me.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.800
Why don't you hightail us
up to that vehicle...

08:35.800 --> 08:38.300
so we can get an eyeful
of who's behind that wheel?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.100
I don't like crowded roads.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.500
Well, everybody has their quirks.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.900
Maybe we should start small.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.900
You got a name?

08:55.400 --> 08:57.000
Byron Gruman.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.300
Byron, huh?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.300
Mind if I call you "Burn"?

09:01.400 --> 09:05.300
I've met so many people over the years,
I've come to rely on nicknames.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.000
We won't be together long enough
for it to matter what you call me.

09:09.100 --> 09:13.100
Perhaps, but you never know
what fate holds in store for you.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.700
Look at me.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.700
When I was a poor sharecropper's son
driving a truck...

09:17.800 --> 09:21.400
every time a big, shiny car
like that drove by...

09:21.400 --> 09:23.400
it started me daydreaming.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.900
So I worked hard,
served my country.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.700
I did all right.

09:27.800 --> 09:32.700
Then one day my life
spiraled out of my hands.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.300
I lost sight
of what was meaningful.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.400
My wife, my child, my music.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.400
I found myself needin' time
just to catch my breath, so I split.

09:46.100 --> 09:49.200
It's a fascinating story.

09:49.300 --> 09:53.400
But besides that hair,
you hardly even look like Elvis.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.000
I think I look pretty good, considering
I've been on my feet for 20 years.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.000
You're a drifter.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.200
The title ain't nearly as rewarding
as the work.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.200
I travel around, lend a hand
to folks who need it.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.800
What about you? What line of work
lies in your tomorrow?

10:14.900 --> 10:17.900
I don't think much about the future.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.100
Well, I've given worse off than you
their footing.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.900
Listen. I'm gonna stop here
for a while.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.700
No matter what, I usually keep
a few states between me and Tennessee.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.200
Tell you what.
Why don't I buy you some lunch here?

10:42.300 --> 10:46.200
Then you drop me off
just over the state line in Texas.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.400
I can catch a good ride there.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.800
I guess I could eat something.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.000
Man alive!

10:56.100 --> 10:59.700
That was almost as tasty
as my mama used to do.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.000
God bless her soul.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.900
You said you had a dinner date
this Sunday?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.800
Recognize the day, do you?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.300
Not really.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.200
Then I guess you're not much
of a fan of mine.

11:16.300 --> 11:20.200
Son, come this Sunday
it'll be August 16.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.200
The anniversary of the day I died.

11:23.900 --> 11:28.600
I suppose this ridiculous tale
is your version of a mid-life crisis?

11:28.700 --> 11:31.600
Well, I did turn 60 a while back.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.900
But it was more than that.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.700
All these years on the trail
made me realize...

11:36.800 --> 11:40.700
that the life I left behind
wasn't so bad after all.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.100
So I decided it was time
to resume my career.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.500
Wrote everyone back home
and told them to have a bash...

11:46.500 --> 11:51.400
waitin' at my estate
come Sunday afternoon.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.400
I wouldn't expect much of a homecoming
if I was you.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.900
That's $10.80 all together.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.400
Listen, Burn, I'll need
a small loan here.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.400
I'm sure the good folks at Graceland
will pay you back.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.200
Plus interest.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.300
- You don't have any money?
- My word is gold.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.400
Good.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.800
Then you shouldn't have any problem
talking your way out of washing dishes.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.900
Hold on.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.300
Somebody has to pay for this.

12:36.700 --> 12:40.200
Franny, why don't we settle this
between the two of us.

12:40.200 --> 12:44.500
Honey, I can tell you waited on
some high rollers now and then.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.300
- What's this?
- Don't bother thanking me.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.900
But the tab was nearly $11.00.
I insist you put down more for the tip.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.800
- You what?
- I insist.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.300
I'll wrestle it out of you
if I have to.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.800
Why, Elvis, you are the gentleman.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.500
Keep the faith, sweet lady.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.800
What's your problem, son?

13:41.900 --> 13:43.400
My problem?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.400
You're my only problem.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.000
Other than that,
life's peachy-keen.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.400
First I give you a ride.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.700
Then I'm forced to spring
for your damn lunch.

13:52.700 --> 13:56.600
Okay, you got a right
to be angry.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.200
But walk a mile in my shoes, Burn.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.200
I'm rich, famous, vulnerable.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.700
I got to know the kind of man
I'm befriendin'.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.900
Who the hell are you to judge me?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
You don't know me.
You don't know what I've been through.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.700
Judging from that tarnished ring
you wear, it's pretty clear.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.500
Your wife left you.

14:15.600 --> 14:19.400
But taking it out on that woman
back there wasn't fair.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.300
My wife didn't leave me.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.300
She's dead.

14:23.300 --> 14:27.200
She died in a car accident
over a year ago. You happy now?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.400
I don't celebrate death, Byron.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.000
Trust me.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.100
I've lost more than my share
of loved ones.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.600
I don't want to hear any more lies
about your life.

14:41.700 --> 14:45.400
Let's get something straight.
I don't believe you're Elvis.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.300
Frankly, I don't care who you are...

14:48.400 --> 14:50.700
or what terrible things
have happened to your life.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.700
I'm gonna make you care, Burn.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.500
I'm gonna make you believe.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.500
I'm gonna take you to Texas...

15:04.500 --> 15:08.100
because unlike you
I'm a man who keeps his word.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.900
After that, we're history.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.100
If you say so.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.100
But I'm warnin' you.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.400
You'll be sorry once I'm gone.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.100
Don't bet on it.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.700
Well, Burn, I guess this is it.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Again...

16:09.100 --> 16:13.100
I'm sorry if I did anything
to pester you.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.600
Forget it.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.800
Good luck, wherever you're headed.

16:20.300 --> 16:24.500
I got a feeling our destinations
aren't so far apart.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.100
But wherever you go,
remember the King.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.100
Just one night.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.600
Seventeen.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.000
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I've seen better.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.300
Thank you.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.100
Get on up, baby!

17:48.100 --> 17:51.200
It's time to party with the King.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.700
Wake up.

18:06.500 --> 18:11.000
Well, read 'em and weep, Elvis.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.000
Girls, if you're gonna trounce me...

18:14.000 --> 18:17.600
the least you could do is make it look
like you're concentratin'.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.300
Listen, son...

18:29.700 --> 18:32.000
I'm gonna need some help here.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.400
In a few minutes,
this situation...

18:35.400 --> 18:39.300
might be more than a man
of my propriety can handle.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.200
One hand.

18:43.300 --> 18:47.900
Will you promise me you'll leave
right after, rain or shine?

18:47.900 --> 18:51.300
Seeing you take a risk
will be well worth a wet coat.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.200
Girls, you're in trouble now.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.200
I found me an ally.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.200
Sit here, soldier.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.600
We can swap war stories.

19:01.700 --> 19:06.200
Be sweet to me and I might even
let you see my purple heart.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.600
I'm afraid there won't be time
for that.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.100
Full house.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.900
Damn!

19:14.900 --> 19:17.900
Nice deal, Maggie.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.700
That's not fair, Heather.
Burn hasn't picked you yet.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.400
I know, but I picked him.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.900
One more hand, Burn?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.400
It stopped raining.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.000
- That's not fair.
- Oh, come on.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.000
What about our self-respect?

19:38.100 --> 19:40.400
You want your self-respect back?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.900
Okay, we'll play a new game.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.900
Called "Reality Check."

19:45.000 --> 19:47.300
That sounds dull.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.300
How 'bout it, old timer?

19:51.300 --> 19:53.900
You up for a little identity test?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.200
Happy to oblige.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.500
We'll start easy.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.000
What size shoe did Elvis wear?

20:05.400 --> 20:08.700
My shoe size? Jesus.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.000
Wrong.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.000
But I ain't answered yet.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.200
It's just been so long
since I actually purchased a new pair.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.700
Yeah.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.900
Let me check.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.300
Twelve D.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.400
How'd you know that?

20:32.900 --> 20:37.400
He's right, your flesh is gonna be
public property soon, Burn.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.200
Elvis' purple Cadillac.
How did he describe the shade he wanted?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.300
That's easy.

20:44.400 --> 20:49.100
I said I wanted the car to look like
someone squashed grapes on the hood.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.600
I read that.

20:50.700 --> 20:54.700
What year did Elvis buy Graceland? What
was his Army rank, registration number?

20:56.300 --> 20:59.800
That's hardly one question,
but I'll let it slide.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.200
I bought Gladys her slice of heaven...

21:03.300 --> 21:06.400
in March, '57...

21:06.500 --> 21:09.500
and she was proud I made sergeant.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.900
53310761.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.300
He's right.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.700
It says so right here.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.600
Put your dancin' shoes on, Burn.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.300
<i>One night with you</i>

21:40.700 --> 21:42.800
I love a man with scars.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.400
That still hurt
from when your wife died?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.400
How'd you know that?

21:49.500 --> 21:54.400
Oh, baby, Elvis told us
the whole story.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.700
How she was killed in a car accident.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.300
Everybody out.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.900
Calm down, son.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.900
I'm not your son.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.500
I'm awfully sorry about this...

22:10.600 --> 22:12.000
ladies.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.100
It's all right, Elvis.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.500
We love you like life itself.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.900
But your friend here
has got the manners of a scud missile.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.600
Son...

22:32.900 --> 22:35.900
I'm not feelin' so keen.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.000
Mind if I lay down a while?

24:03.000 --> 24:07.400
I was beginning to think I'd have
to walk the rest of the way to Memphis.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.900
No trouble.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Tell me about the nightmare
you had last night...

24:11.000 --> 24:14.600
and I might let you take the wheel.

24:14.700 --> 24:18.400
My dreams ain't but
a bunch of nonsense, Burn.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.800
That's a pity, 'cause this car's
running silky smooth.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.100
Don't I know it.

24:24.200 --> 24:28.100
What was it you called it?
"The cream of American history"?

24:28.200 --> 24:30.200
Ho! Let me think.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.900
There's these two people...

24:38.000 --> 24:40.800
they hang about my sleep all the time.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.900
A woman and a child.

24:46.700 --> 24:50.200
When I wake, they're gone.

24:51.100 --> 24:52.800
Who are they?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I never see their faces.

24:56.100 --> 24:59.800
I wish they'd introduce themselves to me
or leave me alone.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.900
What's your name?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.900
Maybe if you told me your name,
then you could remember theirs.

25:19.400 --> 25:23.000
That's twice in two days
you've let that car fly by.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.700
It's just a coincidence.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.700
There's no such thing as coincidence.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.900
All you got to do is open
your eyes and ears...

25:33.000 --> 25:35.300
and you'll see the beauty in fate.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.400
I'll bet the first look you got
of Beatrice...

25:39.500 --> 25:42.100
you knew it was preordained.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.300
How'd you know her name?

25:47.500 --> 25:50.000
It must've stumbled
out of you somewhere.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.300
I was gonna be a doctor.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.700
I was the most coordinated person
I knew.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.100
I never tripped,
never broke a bone in my body.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.300
Then one day I wind up killing
the woman I lived for.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.000
Exactly how did you do that?

26:26.600 --> 26:28.800
You have ten minutes.

26:28.900 --> 26:33.500
You drive no faster than 35,
and you stop when I say.

26:42.300 --> 26:45.100
This car is one of
the more beautiful sights...

26:45.200 --> 26:47.500
I've seen in a long time.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.400
Man...

26:53.500 --> 26:56.900
it's been ages since I've handled
a baby like this.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.700
I do believe a moment of reflection
is in order.

27:05.300 --> 27:09.000
Now, by God, grab hold of somethin'!

27:13.000 --> 27:15.100
Slow down.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.500
How did you kill Beatrice, Byron?

27:20.600 --> 27:24.500
Did you blow a tire?
Did you lose your brakes?

27:24.500 --> 27:26.400
I don't remember.

27:26.400 --> 27:30.300
Bull! You're just afraid
to face the truth.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.400
Slow down!

27:43.300 --> 27:44.700
Why you--

27:46.800 --> 27:49.800
<i>I wanna rip it up
I wanna shake it up</i>

27:49.800 --> 27:51.400
Pull over!

27:56.100 --> 27:58.700
- Look at that! An escort.
- Shit!

28:14.300 --> 28:16.900
Relax. I can handle this.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.700
You're certifiable.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.700
- Do you have a driver's license?
- 'Course I do.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.000
Though come to think of it,
I haven't renewed it since I died.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.100
License and registration, please.

28:35.600 --> 28:40.100
Officer Haynes. I'm afraid I left
my I.D. in my other pants this mornin'.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.600
But you can recognize the King.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.800
So what can I do for you today?

28:44.800 --> 28:47.600
An autographed five by ten
for the loved ones perhaps?

28:47.700 --> 28:50.100
Both of you,
out of the car now.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.100
He's just kiddin', Officer.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.500
I don't have a sense of humor.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.400
Since your friend don't have a license,
you both have a right to remain silent.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.900
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.500
You're arresting both of us?

29:04.500 --> 29:07.800
Just arrest this lunatic.
I was just giving him a lift.

29:07.900 --> 29:10.100
You picked the wrong cargo.

29:10.100 --> 29:14.000
Far as I'm concerned, Elvis was nothin'
but an overrated saloon singer.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.200
Can I help it if your high school
sweetheart had the hots for me?

29:20.800 --> 29:23.100
Get over here!

29:25.800 --> 29:27.800
What do you think, Burn?

29:27.800 --> 29:32.800
Maybe I should show the man the light by
beltin' out a little "Jailhouse Rock."

29:32.800 --> 29:34.700
One note.

29:34.700 --> 29:38.000
One note, and I cannot
be held responsible for my actions.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.100
Like what?

29:41.200 --> 29:43.600
Tearing at my clothes
and wettin' yourself?

29:47.900 --> 29:49.900
Don't fret, Burn.

29:49.900 --> 29:54.000
I haven't met a law enforcement agent
yet wasn't soft on the King.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.000
Sheriff Haynes?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.300
What now?

30:00.400 --> 30:02.000
Are you from Mississippi?

30:03.600 --> 30:05.300
Born in East Tupelo.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.100
No tall tale!

30:10.100 --> 30:14.600
I had a schoolyard friend by the name
of Harold looked just like you.

30:15.900 --> 30:18.000
We used to call him "Hap."

30:19.400 --> 30:21.300
Friends used to call me that.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
See, Burn?

30:24.600 --> 30:27.100
Me and Haynes are kin.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.300
He didn't say he knows you.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.900
Sure he does.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.400
Hap, you recall Mrs. Grimes'
fifth grade homeroom?

30:34.500 --> 30:37.700
How we had to recite
those God-long poems?

30:37.700 --> 30:41.100
"Sunset and evening star...

30:41.100 --> 30:45.300
and one clear call for me.

30:45.300 --> 30:50.300
And may there be no moaning of the bar
when I put out to sea."

30:51.300 --> 30:55.600
"But such a tide as moving
seems asleep...

30:55.700 --> 30:58.500
too full of sound and foam.

30:58.600 --> 31:02.400
When that which drew
from out the boundless deep...

31:02.500 --> 31:05.500
turns once again home.

31:05.600 --> 31:10.800
Twilight and evening bell,
and after that the dark.

31:10.900 --> 31:15.400
And may there be no sadness
of farewell when I embark."

31:16.800 --> 31:19.100
No!

31:19.200 --> 31:22.000
That's why I left Memphis
in the first place.

31:22.100 --> 31:25.300
Elvis impersonators, reporters
knockin' on my door night and day...

31:25.300 --> 31:29.500
looking for some small detail of the
final years they could turn into money.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.900
A bad dose of celebrity, huh?

31:35.100 --> 31:37.100
You know what the worst was?

31:38.800 --> 31:41.200
There was nothin' I could tell 'em.

31:43.400 --> 31:47.900
The day I heard Elvis had gone,
I was surprised as any.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.200
I'd no idea he wasn't well.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.000
Sure, he was under
a lot of pressure, but--

31:58.300 --> 32:02.100
Let's just say sometimes
I wonder.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.000
Well, I never could play you, Hap.

32:05.100 --> 32:10.500
What can I say to make you see fit
to forgive such an abrupt farewell?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.500
Remember this with me.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.600
Once when me and Elvis was just boys...

32:21.700 --> 32:25.300
ridin' around in a little red wagon
in his backyard...

32:25.400 --> 32:27.600
I guess I turned a tad fast.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.700
Anyway, he fell out.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.600
He didn't get hurt, just got scared
and started cryin'.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.500
And you started screaming,
"Hiss! Hiss!"

32:37.600 --> 32:41.100
Because you couldn't say "Elvis"
till you was almost grown.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.300
I'll be damned!

32:47.300 --> 32:49.900
I have never related that tale
to a soul.

32:49.900 --> 32:52.600
I'll never forget it. My mama
came flyin' out the back door...

32:52.700 --> 32:56.200
with that broom of hers like a hen
to protect her chicks.

32:58.700 --> 33:01.100
I can't believe you believe this.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.900
Watch your manners, boy.

33:03.900 --> 33:07.000
I'll write you up for every
moving violation I can drum up.

33:07.100 --> 33:10.900
Now, Hap, is that really necessary?

33:13.400 --> 33:17.600
I never did apologize
for flippin' that wagon over.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.100
Damn.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.000
Sorry about that...

33:29.200 --> 33:31.100
Elvis.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.500
Remember the King.

33:52.200 --> 33:55.800
- How do you know that man?
- He was my childhood--

33:55.900 --> 33:58.500
No, no. Don't tell me
he was your childhood friend.

34:00.100 --> 34:03.600
Okay. I heard the remnant's of a lisp
when he spoke...

34:03.700 --> 34:06.400
and I guessed he was a fan.

34:07.400 --> 34:10.000
So you admit you lied to him!

34:10.100 --> 34:12.000
- Does it matter?
- What?

34:12.100 --> 34:14.800
So what if I might have lied to Hap?

34:14.900 --> 34:17.800
And I'm not saying I did,
but he believed me.

34:17.800 --> 34:21.100
He can rest easier now.
So what harm am I?

34:21.200 --> 34:23.400
You think your games are harmless?

34:23.400 --> 34:26.800
Let me tell you what kind of damage
a car can do when it's out of control.

34:29.200 --> 34:32.100
Just imagine you're driving
alongside a train.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.500
You take your eyes off the road
for just one second to kiss your wife.

34:35.600 --> 34:39.900
When you turn back,
the train's comin' at you.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
That's tragic, all right, Burn.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.400
But imagine the freedom you'd feel...

34:45.500 --> 34:48.900
if you would admit
what really happened that night.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.700
How would you know what happened?

35:12.800 --> 35:15.800
Great! Now look what you did!

35:15.800 --> 35:18.100
I fix what I break.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.900
Stay away from this car.
Come near this car again, I'll kill you.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.100
All right. It's all right.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.100
It's all right by me.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.600
I'll walk the rest of the way.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.700
Remember the--

35:39.800 --> 35:43.900
Ah, hell. Forget the King.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.500
The King's dead!

36:33.800 --> 36:35.300
Well...

36:35.400 --> 36:39.300
besides needin' a new radiator
and some serious bodywork...

36:40.400 --> 36:42.900
man, this thing
is surprisingly healthy.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.900
Come back first light in the mornin',
you'll be surprised how she runs.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.400
How much is it gonna cost me?

36:50.500 --> 36:52.400
Not a penny.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.400
You're kiddin'.

36:54.500 --> 36:57.100
No, man. Elvis covered you.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.100
And we take special care
of friend's of the King.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
You know where he went?

37:05.800 --> 37:09.000
Head down that road there
with your eyes open.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.100
You can't miss him.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.600
See ya later.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
dress up the front line.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.300
We have a new shooter coming out.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.700
Eleven! Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
play the game.

38:03.100 --> 38:06.900
Baby needs a new pair of shoes!

38:08.000 --> 38:10.600
- Seven the winner!
- Way to go!

38:14.000 --> 38:15.600
Hey, there.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.500
Let it ride, dealer, for my friend.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.500
Norma Jean, I wonder
if you'd do me the honor...

38:37.600 --> 38:42.400
of bringin' Lady Luck
to these here cubes.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.800
- Oh, I couldn't possibly gamble.
- Come on, Marilyn.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.600
You know you can't refuse the King.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.000
No good subject would.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.300
- Come on, baby!
- No more bets. Comin' out.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.000
A winner! Eleven!

39:10.600 --> 39:14.500
Damn, I told her to lay off
the sleeping pills.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.700
Is there a doctor in the house?

39:19.700 --> 39:22.000
Don't worry, the boy's in med school.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.500
Ma'am. Ma'am!

39:28.000 --> 39:29.500
I'll be damned.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.300
What the hell are you doing?

39:35.400 --> 39:38.200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

39:38.300 --> 39:42.800
I guess the sight of all that money
must've taken my breath away.

39:42.900 --> 39:47.100
Then when I woke to find such
a handsome young man kissing me...

39:47.200 --> 39:50.000
I just couldn't help myself.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.600
Are you all right, honey?

39:55.400 --> 39:56.900
I think so.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.900
Can you make out my face?

40:01.300 --> 40:02.900
Elvis?

40:03.000 --> 40:07.100
- She sounds healthy to me!
- Marilyn lives!

40:08.100 --> 40:10.900
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen!

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
All right!
Come to our show tonight...

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
in the Bijou Theatre
and see her live on stage.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.800
Thank you, Elvis.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.900
And to this brave, young man.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.700
I do love doctors, almost as much as
I love playwrights and baseball players.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.200
Thanks. Bye.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.800
Come on, Elvis.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.800
Place your bets on the front line.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.400
All bets down, sir.

40:38.300 --> 40:41.600
Let it ride, dealer.
Do or die.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.200
Are you crazy?
There must be $5,000 there.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.200
Who invited you to the party?

40:49.100 --> 40:51.200
Baby needs a new pair of shoes!

40:53.100 --> 40:56.100
Snake eyes! Crap dice.
Loser!

40:56.200 --> 40:57.700
I'm sorry, sir.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.500
That's all right.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.900
I guess Lady Luck's been frightened away
to another table.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.600
Remember the King!

41:26.200 --> 41:28.200
You got enough for bus fare?

41:30.600 --> 41:32.600
What's the matter?

41:32.700 --> 41:35.600
Forget some insult
you wanted to hurl at me?

41:42.400 --> 41:44.700
I wanted to thank you
for sending that tow back.

41:44.700 --> 41:47.600
I'd probably still be sitting there.

41:47.600 --> 41:53.300
Look, I apologize for getting
a bit dramatic back there.

41:53.400 --> 41:57.400
But you've got to admit,
you are a bit jarring on one's system.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.100
Why is that, Burn?

42:01.100 --> 42:04.000
What exactly is it about me
that rattles you...

42:04.100 --> 42:06.000
besides my music?

42:06.100 --> 42:08.500
Actually, I like your singing.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.500
Beatrice loved your sing--

42:10.600 --> 42:12.500
I mean Elvis' songs.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.300
Son, just once I'd like to hear you
call me by my name.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.300
Just once!
Then maybe I'd believe...

42:19.400 --> 42:22.900
you could take a likin' to something
other than your own misery.

42:28.100 --> 42:29.500
Hold on.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.100
What's this?

42:37.100 --> 42:40.200
It's the last of my savings.
It should cover the cost of the car.

42:41.500 --> 42:44.100
I'm drowning in human kindness.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.300
Damn it. Take the money.

42:50.400 --> 42:54.000
You haven't heard a word I've said
since we met, have you?

42:55.300 --> 42:59.300
The best gratuity you could show me
is friendship.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.600
If money meant anything to me...

43:01.700 --> 43:04.700
I wouldn't have left
the mansion and plane behind.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.500
Seems to me you haven't traveled
as far as you think.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.300
My God! That girl
does resemble Marilyn.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.900
For a moment,
she actually had me fooled.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.900
I like that in a woman.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.500
I thought you would.

43:29.700 --> 43:32.400
It got a pretty good reaction,
you know.

43:32.500 --> 43:33.900
"Remember the King!"

43:34.000 --> 43:35.400
That's great.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.400
And that accent.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.500
Have you ever seen anyone
so convinced he was Elvis?

43:41.600 --> 43:44.800
Convinced?
What's there to doubt?

43:44.900 --> 43:47.200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

43:47.300 --> 43:49.800
Save the song and dance for the show,
Miss Monroe.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.400
I'm always one for enjoying humor
at my expense.

43:52.500 --> 43:55.100
Especially from one so beautiful.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Very smooth. I like it.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.600
Thank you.

43:59.600 --> 44:03.300
Friends, these are those kind guests
I was telling you about.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.800
Elvis, this is Corey and Connie.

44:05.900 --> 44:08.000
That's Al. He's a lawyer from L.A.

44:08.100 --> 44:11.400
This is Sheldon, who runs a chain
of carpet stores in Oregon.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
And that's his wife Pam.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.700
I think you met Gene.
He's the casino entertainment director.

44:16.800 --> 44:19.300
And I'm actually Giles.

44:19.400 --> 44:23.200
"A rose by any other name
would still smell as sweet."

44:23.300 --> 44:24.700
Thank you.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.500
This is Byron Gruman.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.300
Yes, we're quite intimate already.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.300
I'm in shock that you're not
in Graceland this time of the year.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.700
It's been murder trying to find
a good Elvis during the annual vigil.

44:34.700 --> 44:38.900
It's true. Although with a little
mousse, this one might do the trick.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.200
- Don't you think?
- Only one of us is headed to Memphis.

44:43.300 --> 44:45.700
Excuse me.
I have to pick up my car.

44:46.900 --> 44:50.100
- Forgive my friend.
- Sure.

44:51.500 --> 44:53.600
Hold on, Burn!

44:53.700 --> 44:57.100
Where're you goin'?
The party was just gearing up.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.500
Those people can help you to where
you're going quicker than I can.

45:00.600 --> 45:04.500
You still don't believe a thing
I've told you about myself, do you?

45:04.600 --> 45:06.700
You want me to lie to you?

45:07.400 --> 45:09.000
Of course not.

45:09.100 --> 45:12.400
But give me one last chance
to prove myself.

45:12.500 --> 45:16.400
Step outside for a spell,
and I swear, when you return...

45:16.500 --> 45:19.500
I'll have evidence
even you can't question.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.300
What are you scheming now?

45:22.400 --> 45:24.700
Just help me out this once.

45:24.800 --> 45:28.700
Besides, I happen to know your car
won't be ready till morning.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.300
See anything you like?

46:27.700 --> 46:29.500
Is this yours?

46:31.600 --> 46:34.300
When the payments are met,
which isn't always.

46:34.300 --> 46:39.400
So, if you moonlight as a thief,
may I suggest the guest parking lot?

46:39.400 --> 46:41.800
No, I'm just curious.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.900
You passed us on the road
the past couple days.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.200
I pass a lot of people.

46:47.200 --> 46:50.000
You mean you make passes
at a lot of people.

46:51.900 --> 46:53.800
Comes with the job.

46:54.700 --> 46:57.000
Let me ask you something.

46:57.100 --> 47:00.700
When you faint in casinos,
do you kiss every man that revives you?

47:02.500 --> 47:04.400
Actually, that was a first.

47:04.500 --> 47:07.700
But I've learned to trust
my impulses.

47:07.700 --> 47:10.700
Did you ever think someone
might not want to be kissed?

47:10.700 --> 47:14.300
Isn't every American male
attracted to Marilyn Monroe?

47:14.400 --> 47:16.400
Great.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.100
Another deranged soul.

47:22.900 --> 47:25.000
Is there something you wanted?

47:26.600 --> 47:28.000
Nothing.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.400
That's what I thought.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.500
Look...

47:41.600 --> 47:43.600
I didn't mean to be cold.

47:44.700 --> 47:49.300
It's just that I didn't think
life could get any stranger.

47:49.400 --> 47:53.000
Now I find myself stuck
in Mississippi...

47:53.100 --> 47:57.000
the only person sane enough
to recall his own name.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.400
It's cooler inside.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.900
There's a beer in the fridge
if you want it.

48:43.800 --> 48:45.900
What's the deal with your father?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.200
He takes his Elvis pretty seriously.

48:48.200 --> 48:53.100
He's not my father.
He sort of attached himself to me.

48:53.200 --> 48:57.500
He cries in his sleep. I imagine he's
been through some sort of tragedy...

48:57.600 --> 49:00.500
but I can't seem to get
a straight answer out of him.

49:00.600 --> 49:03.600
I've seen a good deal of tragedy
among impersonators.

49:10.400 --> 49:13.300
Without the gear,
you hardly look like Marilyn Monroe.

49:15.900 --> 49:18.300
I know.
Spooky, isn't it?

49:19.200 --> 49:20.600
Lipstick and wigs.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.500
I actually happened to be singing once
at happy hour...

49:25.600 --> 49:29.500
and a guy said I sounded like Marilyn,
so I bought that ticket out.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.700
Don't you find living in here
a bit cramped?

49:33.700 --> 49:36.700
I'm only in here
a few months out of the year.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.800
Usually I'm pretty much
booked solid in Vegas.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.500
Besides, this thing's got character.

49:42.600 --> 49:45.600
Don't you think what a person drives
reveals a lot about them?

49:47.200 --> 49:49.600
One time in my life
I thought that.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Before you wrecked that Caddy?

49:56.500 --> 49:58.400
How'd you know?

49:58.500 --> 50:02.600
The second I saw you in the Casino,
I recognized you from the road.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.500
Kind of hard to forget.

50:04.600 --> 50:07.300
I thought to myself...

50:07.400 --> 50:10.900
"There's a soul
who looks like he's suffered."

50:11.000 --> 50:13.100
Maybe that's why I kissed you.

50:13.200 --> 50:18.900
Suffering can really make a person
compassionate...

50:19.000 --> 50:20.800
and interesting.

50:20.900 --> 50:25.100
Though I didn't taste too much life
in your lips, I must say.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.900
Because my wife died
in that car accident.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.000
About a year ago in Memphis.

50:36.300 --> 50:39.500
Well, I'm sorry.

50:44.100 --> 50:48.800
I guess if I were you, I wouldn't
be rushing back to Tennessee...

50:48.900 --> 50:51.900
let alone kissing strangers
dressed up like the dead.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.100
What is it about impersonators...

50:56.200 --> 50:59.100
that makes everything you say
sound like philosophy?

51:00.600 --> 51:03.200
I don't know.
Everybody needs guidance.

51:03.300 --> 51:07.800
What difference does it make if
you get it from Jesus, Buddha or Elvis?

51:15.900 --> 51:17.800
I don't want to keep you.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.300
Thanks for the talk.

51:22.300 --> 51:24.900
Sure. What's a performer
without a fan?

51:36.600 --> 51:38.000
I'm an idiot.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.000
Casanova returns.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.100
Barkeep.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.900
Something tropical.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.500
Are you drunk?

52:02.500 --> 52:05.100
Me? Not quite.

52:06.700 --> 52:09.900
Just nursing a bad case
of jitters is all.

52:12.100 --> 52:15.800
I tell you,
the closer I get to Memphis...

52:15.900 --> 52:19.400
the farther away
it just seems to get.

52:19.500 --> 52:22.300
At least we have that in common.

52:22.400 --> 52:25.300
What? Marilyn didn't ease
your burden none?

52:27.000 --> 52:29.100
How would she do that?

52:30.500 --> 52:33.600
Come now. I saw you two heading
in the same direction.

52:35.700 --> 52:37.900
I guess she's attractive.

52:39.100 --> 52:42.400
I loved someone like that once.

52:42.400 --> 52:45.700
The type that would gamble
their life on a whim.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.600
And that's bad?

52:49.600 --> 52:51.600
If they lose.

53:00.100 --> 53:02.000
Burn...

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
when we buried my mama...

53:05.100 --> 53:09.200
I tried jumping into the grave
after her as well.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.200
She was all I lived for.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.100
My best girl.

53:14.200 --> 53:17.200
Then one day in Germany
I met this young lady.

53:17.300 --> 53:20.700
She wasn't like so many
of the rest of them.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.500
I guess most of them
were overawed by me...

53:23.600 --> 53:27.200
by what I was supposed to be.

53:27.600 --> 53:30.300
But with this chick,
it was different.

53:30.400 --> 53:34.600
She never gave the impression at all
she was tongue-tied...

53:34.700 --> 53:36.800
and I was hooked.

53:36.900 --> 53:40.000
Now, nobody will ever replace
my mama...

53:40.000 --> 53:44.700
but I swear, letting myself get close
to another warm soul...

53:44.800 --> 53:46.800
filled a great void in me.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.200
Hypothetically...

53:54.300 --> 53:57.200
if I was interested in her...

53:57.200 --> 53:59.300
what would you suggest I do?

54:03.600 --> 54:06.100
Crooning always did wonders for me.

54:10.800 --> 54:12.600
You forgot this.

54:12.700 --> 54:17.400
That's for you. A ticket
to the mother of all comebacks.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.100
You performing here?

54:20.200 --> 54:21.800
As the crow flies.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.700
This isn't gonna prove you're Elvis.

54:25.800 --> 54:30.500
I defy anyone who sees me tonight
to call me a fraud.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.900
<i>He's not so good in a crowd</i>

54:45.000 --> 54:48.500
<i>But when you get him alone</i>

54:48.600 --> 54:51.700
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

54:51.800 --> 54:54.500
<i>He isn't much at a dance</i>

54:54.600 --> 54:58.300
<i>But when he takes you home</i>

54:58.400 --> 55:02.000
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

55:02.000 --> 55:06.600
<i>He doesn't look like much of a lover</i>

55:07.800 --> 55:11.500
<i>Don't judge a book by its cover</i>

55:12.800 --> 55:16.800
<i>He's got the face of an angel but</i>

55:16.900 --> 55:19.800
<i>There's a devil in his eye</i>

55:21.000 --> 55:23.200
<i>He's such a delicate thing</i>

55:23.300 --> 55:26.300
<i>But when he starts in the squeeze</i>

55:27.400 --> 55:30.300
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

55:30.400 --> 55:32.800
<i>He doesn't look very strong</i>

55:32.800 --> 55:36.000
<i>But when you sit on his knee</i>

55:36.100 --> 55:39.800
<i>You would be surprised</i>

55:40.700 --> 55:45.300
<i>At a party or at a ball</i>

55:45.300 --> 55:49.400
<i>I've got to admit he's nothing at all</i>

55:49.500 --> 55:52.400
<i>But in an easy chair</i>

55:53.500 --> 55:55.800
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

56:18.200 --> 56:22.600
<i>He doesn't look like much of a lover</i>

56:23.900 --> 56:28.700
<i>Don't judge a book by its cover</i>

56:28.700 --> 56:32.600
<i>'Cause he's got the face
of an angel but</i>

56:32.700 --> 56:36.900
<i>There's a devil in his eyes</i>

56:37.000 --> 56:39.100
<i>He doesn't say very much</i>

56:39.200 --> 56:42.900
<i>But when he starts in to speak</i>

56:43.000 --> 56:45.700
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

56:45.800 --> 56:48.600
<i>He's not so good at the start</i>

56:48.700 --> 56:50.900
<i>But at the end of the week</i>

56:52.200 --> 56:54.800
<i>You would be surprised</i>

56:56.900 --> 57:01.000
<i>On a streetcar or on a train</i>

57:01.100 --> 57:05.200
<i>You'd think he was born
without any brain</i>

57:05.200 --> 57:08.200
<i>But in a taxicab</i>

57:10.100 --> 57:13.200
<i>And when he start to grab</i>

57:14.300 --> 57:17.100
<i>I said a taxicab</i>

57:18.200 --> 57:22.900
<i>You would be surprised</i>

57:25.300 --> 57:28.400
<i>This one's a real danger</i>

57:37.000 --> 57:38.800
Ladies and gentlemen, Marilyn.

57:38.800 --> 57:41.300
Before the Hollywood Casino
brings on its next legend...

57:41.400 --> 57:44.000
I have a message
for a very important guest...

57:44.100 --> 57:46.300
Mr. Byron Gruman.

57:46.300 --> 57:50.700
Would you come backstage? Come on up.
It's very important. It can't wait.

57:50.800 --> 57:53.100
We'll be right back.
Thank you.

57:53.100 --> 57:55.700
We'll be back with Elvis.

58:00.800 --> 58:03.600
- There you are.
- What's going on?

58:05.000 --> 58:06.600
See for yourself.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.200
Hey, Burn.

58:12.300 --> 58:14.300
How long has he been like this?

58:14.300 --> 58:17.200
About an hour. I've seen it before.
He's afraid to go on.

58:18.300 --> 58:20.600
I don't care if he lives or he dies.

58:20.700 --> 58:22.600
I advanced you $600 for an Elvis.

58:22.700 --> 58:26.100
You're his manager. Manage him.
Give him some coffee.

58:26.100 --> 58:29.300
- He said I managed him?
- That's right.

58:29.400 --> 58:33.000
I should've left you in Texas.
Now get up! Where's the money?

58:34.300 --> 58:37.100
Lost it. Roulette.

58:37.100 --> 58:41.000
I don't give a damn. If he's not
on stage soon, I'm calling the police.

58:41.100 --> 58:43.900
And both of you are going down
for fraud. You got it?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.100
Fraud?

58:46.200 --> 58:49.800
Get up! Come on, get up.

58:51.900 --> 58:54.100
Come on.

58:58.400 --> 59:00.200
There you go.

59:01.300 --> 59:03.200
All right.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.300
Burn...

59:06.400 --> 59:07.900
I can't.

59:10.200 --> 59:11.700
I know.

59:11.800 --> 59:14.000
Look. I never told you this before...

59:14.000 --> 59:16.600
but Beatrice knew everything
about Elvis.

59:16.700 --> 59:20.800
She told me that the first time
he was on stage, he was scared to death.

59:20.900 --> 59:25.100
He didn't know what all the yelling
was about, that his body was moving.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.500
So when he went off stage
and asked his manager, he said...

59:27.600 --> 59:29.600
"What'd I do? What'd I do?"

59:29.600 --> 59:32.500
Know what he said? "Whatever it is--"

59:32.500 --> 59:35.600
"Go back out there and do it again."

59:35.600 --> 59:37.600
Right.

59:37.600 --> 59:39.800
I know you're not Elvis.

59:39.900 --> 59:43.100
And I know you're scared to death,
but if you don't go out there...

59:43.200 --> 59:46.900
you're gonna see a violent side of me
that you never even dreamed of.

59:52.600 --> 59:54.600
You look good.

59:59.500 --> 1:00:00.700
Fine.

1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:02.700
Come on, let's go.

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:04.200
Come on.

1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.900
- Here.
- I can't do this.

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:12.400
You're gonna do it, believe me.
Take this and do it.

1:00:12.500 --> 1:00:16.000
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Get him out there.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.800
You're gonna be great, Elvis.
If you forget any words, do some karate.

1:00:19.900 --> 1:00:21.800
This crowd will love it.

1:00:21.900 --> 1:00:23.900
<i>Hailing from Memphis, Tennessee,
our final legend...</i>

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.600
<i>the King of Rock and Roll!</i>

1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:54.900
<i>We're caught in a trap</i>

1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:00.100
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.100
<i>Because I love you too much</i>

1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:08.600
<i>Baby</i>

1:01:12.100 --> 1:01:14.700
<i>Why can't you see</i>

1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:19.300
<i>What you're doing to me</i>

1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:25.100
<i>When you don't believe a word</i>

1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:28.400
<i>I'm saying</i>

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:35.800
<i>We can't go on together</i>

1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:39.200
<i>With suspicious minds</i>

1:01:41.100 --> 1:01:45.600
<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:49.700
<i>On suspicious minds</i>

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:54.300
<i>So if an old friend I know</i>

1:01:54.300 --> 1:01:58.000
<i>Drops by to say hello</i>

1:01:59.700 --> 1:02:04.000
<i>Would I still see suspicion</i>

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.000
<i>In your eyes</i>

1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:12.400
<i>So here we go again</i>

1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:16.700
<i>Asking where I've been</i>

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:24.300
<i>Can't you see these tears are real
I'm trying</i>

1:02:28.100 --> 1:02:32.100
<i>We can't go on together</i>

1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:35.200
<i>With suspicious minds</i>

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:41.400
<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:44.800
<i>On suspicious minds</i>

1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:52.200
<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:57.000
<i>I'll dry the tears from your eyes</i>

1:02:58.100 --> 1:03:04.000
<i>Let's don't let a good thing die</i>

1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:07.500
<i>'Cause, honey</i>

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:10.200
<i>You know</i>

1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:13.000
<i>I'd never lie to you</i>

1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:16.300
<i>Oh, no</i>

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:46.900
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
I'm broiling alive.

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.600
Are you all right?
You were great!

1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:52.300
Watch his head.

1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:56.600
Is he okay?
You all right?

1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.800
- What is it?
- I think he's just dehydrated.

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:03.200
Let's get him to your trailer.
Call the paramedics.

1:05:03.300 --> 1:05:06.800
I want to check his case,
see if there's any medication.

1:05:06.900 --> 1:05:08.600
Help me get him up.

1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:10.800
You should've seen it.

1:06:10.900 --> 1:06:14.800
Two thousand screaming fans.
But don't worry.

1:06:14.900 --> 1:06:17.900
I'll send you all tickets
to the next one.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:20.800
How's the patient?

1:06:20.900 --> 1:06:24.600
I think we can save him
if he'd stop talking for a minute.

1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:27.700
I've never been so insulted.

1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:30.500
- Can I talk to you alone?
- Sure.

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:40.200
- Did you find anything in his case?
- More than I was looking for. Here.

1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:47.300
"Marian and Lilli Burrows...

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:51.000
wife and daughter
of local businessman Jon Burrows...

1:06:51.100 --> 1:06:53.100
were confirmed to be...

1:06:53.100 --> 1:06:56.700
fatalities aboard yesterday's
ill-fated flight bound for Memphis.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.800
Friends expressed concern
for Mr. Burrows who they described...

1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:04.200
as a generous philanthropist known
to entertain with his renditions...

1:07:04.300 --> 1:07:09.500
of the music of Elvis Presley
who passed on early yesterday as well."

1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:12.800
- Oh, no.
- It's incredible.

1:07:14.300 --> 1:07:16.200
There must be something we can do.

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:20.100
Maybe if you take him home.

1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:28.600
What do you say, Doctor?

1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:30.800
What's the prognosis?

1:07:33.700 --> 1:07:38.000
There's nothing wrong that an immediate
red-eye to Graceland won't cure.

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:43.700
You arrange for a chaperone?

1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:47.300
- You're looking at him.
- You?

1:07:49.700 --> 1:07:55.000
Why, I've never seen such an act
of selfless generosity in all my days.

1:07:56.200 --> 1:07:58.200
In that case...

1:08:03.100 --> 1:08:06.000
I do declare
my next set of sandwiches...

1:08:06.100 --> 1:08:09.400
will have Memphis
written all over them.

1:08:15.700 --> 1:08:19.200
Heaven help me.
I do love those sandwiches.

1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:26.200
You were great! We loved it.

1:08:42.900 --> 1:08:47.000
Miss Ashley, Burn and I
can't thank you enough...

1:08:47.100 --> 1:08:49.200
for the pre-coffee delivery.

1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:51.200
It was my pleasure.

1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:55.800
You two just say your farewells,
and I'll check on the car's progress.

1:08:59.300 --> 1:09:04.300
Maybe you can call around, see if any
of the Burrows family is in Memphis.

1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:05.900
All right.

1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:13.800
Look me up if you ever find your way
through Nevada, okay?

1:09:13.900 --> 1:09:16.200
I'm just trying to survive Memphis.

1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:28.700
We did it, boys. Look at him.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:34.600
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:37.600
the car of cars.

1:09:38.900 --> 1:09:41.300
What the hell did you do?

1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:46.000
Brought out the beauty that was lurking
beneath this baby's pained exterior.

1:09:47.300 --> 1:09:49.400
What do you think?

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:51.700
Quite a vision now, isn't she?

1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:54.000
The car is beautiful!

1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:57.900
How did you pay for this?

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.100
It don't matter.

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:05.000
Consider it a donation
from some very generous technicians.

1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:09.500
It's like new.

1:10:11.700 --> 1:10:13.400
You're gifted.

1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:18.600
Anything to get the King
of Rock and Roll home in style.

1:10:18.700 --> 1:10:21.200
See, Miss Ashley,
my efforts are flowering.

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:26.200
A day ago, this boy threatened to kill
anybody that came close to this vehicle.

1:10:26.300 --> 1:10:28.700
What a difference a day makes.

1:10:29.700 --> 1:10:31.500
Hop in, Burn.

1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:34.800
Leave now when we can reach
my heavenly home by noon.

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:39.200
- Thank you.
- You got it, Burn.

1:10:39.300 --> 1:10:40.900
Thank you all.

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:54.100
Miss Ashley, it was a pleasure
making your acquaintance.

1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:57.300
Come on by Graceland someday soon.

1:10:57.400 --> 1:10:59.500
I'd be honored.

1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:09.700
Remember the King!

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:14.700
Kind of hard to forget him.

1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:43.300
Burn, I got to tell you something.

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:48.800
This ain't the first time
I've tried coming home.

1:11:50.900 --> 1:11:55.500
Honestly, I've held up that
cardboard sign around my birthday...

1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:59.100
just about every year
in the past 20 now.

1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:01.800
Only I've never come this close before.

1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:06.900
Guess I owe it
to my chance meeting with you...

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.200
a man who shares as much history
with this town as I do.

1:12:10.300 --> 1:12:12.200
So promise me something.

1:12:12.300 --> 1:12:14.500
What's that?

1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:19.600
If I turn and run,
shoot me in the back.

1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:21.700
I'll be right behind you.

1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:44.700
The tour is closed in preparation
for the vigil tonight, gentlemen.

1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:47.700
I understand.

1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:50.600
But this man here claims to be Elvis.

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.500
Is that right?

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:58.100
Sorry I'm late.
It's been a long road home.

1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:04.500
I'm sorry, sir.
There must be some mistake.

1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:06.800
The line forms at 7:00.

1:13:06.900 --> 1:13:10.900
Why not come back then and we'll try
to bump you to the front of it.

1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.900
I guess that ends that.

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:23.400
Ends what?

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:27.800
The boys used to play this game
with me all the time.

1:13:27.900 --> 1:13:29.600
Lock me out...

1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:33.400
testing how long it took
for me to break into my own home.

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.600
And you can bet right now
they're in the dining room...

1:13:37.700 --> 1:13:40.400
laughing their heads off
at our expense.

1:13:42.700 --> 1:13:44.500
We'll show 'em.

1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:46.700
Back out of here.

1:13:57.900 --> 1:13:59.300
Here.

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.500
Please, don't do this.

1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:12.600
I don't wanna get arrested again.

1:14:12.700 --> 1:14:15.800
I've gotten you this far safely,
haven't I?

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:21.600
I'm insane.

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:28.100
Shit.

1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:43.700
Hello?

1:15:45.700 --> 1:15:47.100
I'm home.

1:15:54.100 --> 1:15:56.200
Maybe we should go.

1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:00.100
Don't be silly.

1:16:02.700 --> 1:16:06.100
Just look surprised
when they jump out.

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:24.800
Something don't feel right.

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:07.500
There's nobody here.

1:20:41.300 --> 1:20:44.200
I saw your clipping
about the plane crash.

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:49.500
Son...

1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:53.400
you really bought that tale?

1:20:55.100 --> 1:20:59.500
Hell, I had that thing
printed up ages ago.

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:09.100
Like yourself, some folks need me
to have a more believable identity...

1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:12.300
before they can accept my sympathy.

1:21:18.100 --> 1:21:21.300
Everything about this trip...

1:21:21.300 --> 1:21:26.700
fixing the car, getting arrested,
meeting Ashley...

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:29.600
you planned it all, didn't you?

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:35.900
One never knows what's chance
and what's fate till the ride is over.

1:21:38.500 --> 1:21:42.800
So why don't we turn this car around,
and finish what we started?

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.100
You sure this is where they are?

1:22:25.100 --> 1:22:27.100
They?

1:22:27.100 --> 1:22:29.200
Your wife and child.

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:32.600
That's not who we're here for.

1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:56.300
How'd you know she was here?

1:22:57.400 --> 1:23:00.400
That's a long story.

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:05.800
Let's just say I met a trucker once
who used to drive a train.

1:23:08.700 --> 1:23:11.600
Travel as much as I do,
and you're bound to come across...

1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:15.400
two people that have been touched
by the same tragedy.

1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:22.900
I can't believe
I never came here before.

1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:29.500
We all travel at our own pace, Byron.

1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:34.300
And you've nothing to feel guilty about.

1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:37.700
After all, you didn't really
kill Beatrice, did you?

1:23:44.300 --> 1:23:46.500
I wasn't even drivin'.

1:23:49.100 --> 1:23:53.200
See, in my head,
I see myself behind that wheel.

1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:57.500
But it was her.

1:24:01.500 --> 1:24:03.400
Beatrice was drivin'.

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:06.900
She just wanted to kiss me.

1:24:12.300 --> 1:24:15.000
God, if I'd been drivin'--

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.800
She might be alive?

1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:19.700
Or you might be dead.

1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:23.100
Maybe both of you would have perished.

1:24:25.500 --> 1:24:29.900
How could something so perfect
be taken away from me?

1:24:33.100 --> 1:24:37.000
I've searched a lifetime
for an answer to that question.

1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:43.700
All I know is
you have to forgive yourself...

1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:45.300
the woman...

1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:47.400
God...

1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:52.200
and have faith that the next love
you know won't cause you so much pain.

1:27:20.100 --> 1:27:24.700
My God! Will you look at
this glorious congregation?

1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:28.900
I'm sorry there wasn't a party
for you.

1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:33.100
Right. But I'm sure
it was just a mistake.

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.700
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:41.100
I never dreamed
I'd be this loved by so many.

1:27:43.100 --> 1:27:46.100
To these people I'm home.

1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:49.900
And I guess it should remain that way
for them...

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.900
and maybe for my own sake.

1:27:55.300 --> 1:28:00.000
Sometimes a man has to give up
what's dearest to him to find peace.

1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:03.900
What will you do now?

1:28:05.500 --> 1:28:08.100
Keep moving, I guess.

1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:11.500
I always thought
I'd ride a train a while.

1:28:11.500 --> 1:28:15.000
And what about you?
Where are you headed?

1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:18.100
I was thinking about going west...

1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:20.200
visiting a woman in Vegas.

1:28:27.500 --> 1:28:31.000
Listen, why don't you let me
take you back west a few states?

1:28:31.900 --> 1:28:33.400
Thank you, but no.

1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:37.100
You've already gone too far out
of your way these past couple of days.

1:28:40.300 --> 1:28:43.600
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't come along.

1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:46.300
I was pretty close to doing something.

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:47.900
I know.

1:28:47.900 --> 1:28:51.800
And I hope those thoughts
are nothing but distant memories.

1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.400
It's taken all my strength...

1:28:58.500 --> 1:29:01.000
but I believe you're right.

1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:08.100
One last question.

1:29:08.100 --> 1:29:10.000
What's my name?

1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:21.100
What'd I tell you?

1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:25.600
It's never too late for a comeback.

1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:33.500
I'll be right back.

1:29:44.100 --> 1:29:46.100
What a perfect surprise.

1:29:46.100 --> 1:29:49.200
Can you believe this? This is amazing.
Elvis lives.

1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:51.900
What are you doing here?

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:54.700
I really didn't know what else to do.

1:29:54.800 --> 1:29:57.200
I couldn't find the Burrows family
anywhere near Memphis.

1:29:57.300 --> 1:30:01.700
I tried calling information. I even
checked the public library, and nothing.

1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:04.200
Well, maybe we missed something
in that clipping.

1:30:04.300 --> 1:30:06.300
- Do you still have it?
- No.

1:30:10.300 --> 1:30:12.300
What's the matter?

1:30:14.700 --> 1:30:16.300
Elvis.

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.600
Remember the King.

1:30:33.300 --> 1:30:35.100
Remember the King!

1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:38.600
Friend, I gotta tell you.

1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:42.800
It's been a long time since I rode
in the belly of a boxcar.

1:31:43.900 --> 1:31:46.700
Let me introduce myself.

1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:52.000
The name's Elvis.
