WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:04.879
(Missy): Previously on Ride...

00:04.921 --> 00:06.673
(announcer): Give it up
for Missy McMurray,

00:06.715 --> 00:09.551
former
Miss Rodeo Rocky Mountain!

00:09.592 --> 00:12.262
- This could be an opportunity
for Frontier.

00:12.303 --> 00:15.473
Austin McMurray's widow
doing promos from his home.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.018
- Bel, you could lose the range.
- Does the whole darn town know?

00:18.059 --> 00:19.978
It's not some hobby
you can just pick up.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.772
- That's why I want to partner
with the best ranchers
Colorado has to offer.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.900
- If I'm gonna compete for this
sponsorship, I'm gonna need to
practice on a championship bull.

00:25.942 --> 00:29.195
- You guys make a great team.
I have decided
to make you co-foremen.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.488
- What?
(chuckles)

00:30.530 --> 00:33.074
(upbeat music)

00:38.163 --> 00:41.249
(cows bellowing)

00:46.421 --> 00:48.048
- He's beautiful.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.884
(Missy): Cash, meet Bullet.
And Bullet, meet Cash.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.762
Winner of the PRRO and BRL Gold.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.305
- Look, I didn't buy him.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.725
He's just on a loan from
a stock contractor friend, Rudy.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.935
You got two months.
- Thank you.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.521
- Oh no, thank your coach here.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.357
(clicking tongue)

01:05.398 --> 01:09.402
- So... This is the new
"Big Man on Campus?"

01:09.444 --> 01:11.988
- I pity the bullfighter getting
in the ring with you two.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.740
- Oh, I pity Bullet.

01:13.782 --> 01:17.577
All right, what do you say
we officially
introduce ourselves, huh?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.204
- No, no. Not now,

01:19.245 --> 01:20.914
Tuff here has got a fence
to repair.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.665
With his new co-foreman.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.126
- A fallen branch just
knocked down a couple of posts.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.420
- Oh, it'll be faster to mend
'cause there's two of us.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.546
(cows bellowing)

01:28.588 --> 01:30.423
- And nobody rides
until we do drills.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.967
- Mmm, I'm sure there's
a six-pack in here somewhere!

01:33.009 --> 01:35.679
- All right, all right.
Come on, is this a working ranch
or what?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.347
Go on.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.892
Got your good jacket
ready for the Gala?

01:40.934 --> 01:43.645
- Oh! Right, that's right.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.689
The BRL's tomorrow.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.440
- You did RSVP, didn't you?

01:47.482 --> 01:50.527
- Uh...
- Oh no, Cash McMurray...

01:50.568 --> 01:54.030
Come on, the Bull Riders
League is literally
the who's who of rodeo.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.282
- You know I hate that stuff.
- Doesn't matter.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.785
If you wanna do this,
I mean, really do this...

01:58.827 --> 02:01.329
- I mean, Cash, she's right.
You meet the judges
and they like you,

02:01.371 --> 02:03.123
that can actually mean
a difference in your score.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.668
- Judges should judge me
on my riding, not because
I go to some party.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.836
- It doesn't work that way.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.295
You better hope

02:09.337 --> 02:11.881
that Hank can get you
a belated RSVP

02:11.923 --> 02:14.342
or this guy is going back
to Rudy.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.804
- Okay.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.932
I have my good jacket.
I'm gonna go to the cleaners.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.143
Then I'm gonna do some drills.
- Mm-hmm.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.603
- And then I'm riding.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.564
(bellowing)

02:29.024 --> 02:30.692
(sighing)
- Oh, man.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.862
(bull grunting)

02:36.698 --> 02:38.491
- I promise...

02:38.533 --> 02:40.702
It's the best way
to keep him safe.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.457
(soft music)

02:51.212 --> 02:54.007
- Hey! You ready to go
test drive?

02:54.049 --> 02:56.092
- I need to talk to you first.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.469
It's about Valeria.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.596
- Oh, it's about
that co-manager thing?

02:59.637 --> 03:02.432
Hey, I think it's great.
We're gonna have more time
to train inside the ring.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.685
- No, I saw her meet up
with Tucker Clarke last night.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.396
I was out with Julian and--
- Ooh, Julian, huh?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.814
- Yes, it was a date.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.275
The point is, she said
she doesn't even know him.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.235
Tucker, not Julian.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.446
- No one's really proud
to be hanging out with that guy.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.239
- Right, but that's exactly it.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.783
(whistling)

03:19.824 --> 03:21.910
She comes back after a year
with no excuse.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.536
Now she's meeting up with Tucker

03:23.578 --> 03:26.039
and has all these ideas
about changing things
around here?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.749
You don't think that's
a little suspicious?

03:27.791 --> 03:29.751
- I think you're just a little
upset Mom demoted you.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.087
- No, I'm not. It's just...

03:32.128 --> 03:33.713
It's all a little weird.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.882
- Come on, it's Val
we're talking about.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.844
You do have a tendency
to get in your head a little bit
about stuff like this.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.347
Remember when you thought
the Chapman's scarecrow
came alive at night?

03:42.389 --> 03:44.766
- Cash...
- I mean, you just slept
in Mom's bed for months--

03:44.808 --> 03:46.476
- Cash, I was five.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.728
- Five, 25, you're still making
mountains out of mole hills.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.940
Now please, go mend fences
so we can get inside that ring.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.985
(crowd cheering in the video)

04:00.782 --> 04:02.033
(phone ringing)

04:05.495 --> 04:06.705
- Hello?

04:06.746 --> 04:08.873
- Hi, Missy,
it's Susan, from Frontier.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.875
- Oh, Susan, hi.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.253
- So, people have been buzzing
about that trick
you talked about

04:13.294 --> 04:15.088
on Desiree's radio show,
the Suicide Drag.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.216
We want to incorporate it
into our digital
marketing campaign.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.553
- Oh, that's great.
I, uh, I'm sure I have
some clips I can send over.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.430
- Thing is, you need to be
in Frontier Jeans,

04:23.471 --> 04:25.765
so we're going to send up
a camera crew.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.350
- To the ranch?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.935
(laughing)
- Yes.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.146
Don't worry, I'll be there
to oversee everything.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.981
How's tomorrow?

04:33.023 --> 04:35.025
- Tomorrow...

04:37.152 --> 04:39.821
(soft music)

04:45.994 --> 04:48.038
(suspenseful music)

04:53.877 --> 04:56.588
(bull bellowing)

05:04.554 --> 05:05.889
(indistinct shouting)

05:05.930 --> 05:07.515
(gasping)
(crowd screaming)

05:09.309 --> 05:11.978
(crying)

05:20.278 --> 05:21.988
(knocking)

05:22.030 --> 05:23.365
- Hey.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.034
Are you okay?

05:26.076 --> 05:29.079
- Yeah. Fine. What's up?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.081
- Isabel wants to see us.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.874
- Okay.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.753
(birds chirping)

05:48.890 --> 05:50.850
- Oh, boy.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.521
(muttering)

05:58.233 --> 05:59.651
Hey.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.695
I got good news
and I got bad news.

06:01.736 --> 06:06.282
A pipe burst at the venue
hosting the BRL Gala.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.243
Flooded the place,

06:08.284 --> 06:09.911
and they were considering
cancelling--

06:09.953 --> 06:11.121
- And what's the bad news?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.997
That I pressed my jacket
for nothing?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.958
- Ah-ha, very funny. No.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.587
The good news is that Hank
offered up our ranch
as an alternate venue.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.424
- Uh, as in this barn?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.968
- As in the Gala
that's tomorrow?

06:25.010 --> 06:27.929
- That's not enough time.
- Ma, there's no way.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.347
- Well, we will find a way.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.516
- Why are you pushing
this party so hard?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.852
- Look... You...
you want my support,

06:33.893 --> 06:35.687
and this is
what it looks like.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.731
And look, if it helps
the ranch, it could be
a blessing.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.899
So let's go, let's go,
let's get to work.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.027
I gotta make a few calls.
Be right back.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.570
(sighs)

06:43.611 --> 06:45.780
- Did she say "blessing"?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.331
(light country music)

06:55.373 --> 06:57.167
(grunting)

06:57.208 --> 06:59.210
- Is it even safe
to be in here?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.629
- Yeah, 'cause if
we accidentally kill
one of the judges,

07:01.671 --> 07:04.466
it might hurt my score.
- Hey, shh. You might jinx it.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.262
- You know, the last time that
I was in here was... my wedding.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.806
(sighs)
- Yeah.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.142
That was a really gorgeous
evening.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.437
- I remember him
standing right there.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.939
Big smile on his face.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.110
- Okay, uh, well you go get
the guys,

07:24.152 --> 07:26.112
and Missy and I gotta get
a training session in.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.322
- Okay...
- What?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.115
- Yeah, let's go.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.409
(indistinct chatter)

07:31.451 --> 07:33.495
(horse neighing)

07:34.329 --> 07:36.581
Morning, guys.
First things first--

07:36.623 --> 07:38.166
- That flock of sheep
on its way?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.043
- You can break out
your Little Bo Peep outfit.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.128
- Still got more dates than you.
- All right, all right,

07:42.170 --> 07:43.922
simmer down. I got news.

07:43.963 --> 07:47.175
McMurray Ranch is going to be
hosting the annual
Bull Riders Gala,

07:47.217 --> 07:49.803
which means we're gonna need
your hands getting that
old barn back into shape.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.055
- But Steve does have a point
about the sheep.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.641
We have to prep for them,
and the South Pasture's
pretty grazed out.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.726
So I was thinking we could
rotate to the North Field.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.978
- There's no water
in the North Field.
- No, I know that but--

07:59.020 --> 08:01.398
- So what, we're just supposed
to truckload the water
out there every dang day?

08:01.439 --> 08:03.483
(sighs)
- We could install a solar pump.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.653
- Or we could use
the South Pasture and not waste
time. How 'bout that?

08:06.695 --> 08:10.156
- Or how 'bout you save
that advice for later?
(chuckles)

08:13.368 --> 08:17.664
- And in other news,
Valeria has been promoted
to co-foreman.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.499
- Co-foreman...
- I've never even heard
of that before.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.626
- Well, now you have.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.128
So, I just need a few hands to--

08:23.169 --> 08:25.005
- We don't have the manpower
for that right now.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.840
- Well, I didn't mean
right this second.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.135
- Round 'em up back
and head to the barn.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.056
- Uh, hey. You can't undermine
me like that.

08:35.098 --> 08:38.018
Not on day one.
We're supposed to be a team.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.729
- Is that why you went out
celebrating on your own
last night?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.358
I assume, since you weren't here
working at the ranch.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.235
- Well, I went to bed early.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.281
Look, if this is going to work,

08:51.322 --> 08:53.324
we're gonna have
to trust each other.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.285
- Right...

08:55.326 --> 08:57.245
Trust.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.207
Hmm...
(Valeria exhales deeply)

09:01.249 --> 09:03.668
(metal creaking)

09:06.046 --> 09:08.923
(crowd cheering)

09:08.965 --> 09:11.885
(panting)
- Ow.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.720
(panting)

09:13.762 --> 09:15.430
Hey!

09:15.472 --> 09:17.974
I hear coaching works
real good when the coach
actually watches.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.437
- Sorry, um...
(clears throat)

09:22.479 --> 09:27.150
Hey, I have a question
for you. Um...

09:27.192 --> 09:29.402
How did you...

09:29.444 --> 09:33.865
start riding again after...
you know?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.996
- Well, uh...

09:40.038 --> 09:42.248
It was just something
I needed to do.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.921
- Frontier's sending
a camera crew here
to shoot a promo with me.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.882
(chuckling)
- Look at you, Ms. Fancy Pants.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.468
- Yeah. They want me to do
the Suicide Drag, though.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.178
Tomorrow.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.098
- Well, it's not for scores,
right? Just a performance.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.101
- Yeah, but the problem is
I haven't been performing

10:01.142 --> 10:04.437
or even training
for well over a year.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.439
- You know the expression,
right?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.441
Fall off the horse,
get back on her?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.694
- Yes, I do.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.699
- Okay, then. Yeah.
- What?

10:15.740 --> 10:18.660
Hey! What are you doing?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.831
Cash? Wait.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.961
- Nice job, Val. Uh, Tuff,
come on, pick up all this wood.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.672
Get it out of here, okay?
Oh, hi, Hank!

10:30.714 --> 10:33.633
- Oh, God.
- Oh, come on, don't worry.
We got this.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.635
- Will you got this in an hour?

10:35.677 --> 10:37.554
'Cause that's when the chair
of the BRL Gala Committee

10:37.595 --> 10:39.472
is gonna show up
to scope the place out.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.932
- Well, who's the chair
this year?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.101
- Only the biggest Stock
Contractor in Colorado.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.352
Barbara Sutton.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.856
- You're kidding.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.357
- What?

10:49.399 --> 10:52.277
You two were peas in a pod
back in the day, weren't you?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.739
- Look, uh, Tuff! Valeria!
How long would it take you
to clear out these rafters

10:55.780 --> 10:57.615
and everything living in it?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.617
Plus, I need these windows
washed down.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.077
- That'll take a couple hours
at least--

11:01.119 --> 11:03.079
- No, no, gotta be done
in an hour!

11:03.121 --> 11:05.582
- Uh... Okay, people,
triple time
on whatever you're doing!

11:05.623 --> 11:09.002
Uh, Nic, get rid of
that bird's nest! And Steve,
wash the windows.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.338
- You heard her,
let's go, go, go!

11:11.379 --> 11:12.839
- Isabel, you okay?

11:12.881 --> 11:15.091
(sighing)
- I am fine.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.846
- Boot.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.767
- Aren't we supposed
to be training you?

11:23.808 --> 11:26.853
- Well, it helps if my coach
feels good about riding too.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.066
And clearly I'm not getting
on Bullet anytime soon.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.234
Close your eyes.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.945
Close 'em.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.114
(sighing)

11:38.156 --> 11:41.534
All right, picture yourself
on Whiskey, circling the arena.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.204
Now, your foot's
in the drag strap.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.375
You swing your body
over the side.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.876
(hooves galloping)

11:49.918 --> 11:52.462
Your fingertips brushing
the ground beneath ya.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.132
(breathing deeply)

11:56.174 --> 11:58.259
(hooves galloping)

11:59.177 --> 12:01.429
You feel that?
(horse neighing)

12:02.639 --> 12:04.808
- Yeah.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.520
- Giddy-up.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.606
(soft music)

12:11.648 --> 12:13.733
(panting)

12:13.775 --> 12:15.902
All right, now swing
your body over.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.570
Swing!

12:17.612 --> 12:20.073
(nervous whimpering)
Yeah, yeah, no, you got it!
You got it!

12:20.115 --> 12:22.867
(panting)

12:24.452 --> 12:26.162
Hey, hey, it's okay.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.081
You're just rusty.
You're just rusty.

12:28.123 --> 12:32.127
- No. I keep picturing his face
from that... that day.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.839
That was the last time that
I did that trick or any trick.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.258
(breathing heavily)

12:44.764 --> 12:46.141
(cows bellowing)

12:46.182 --> 12:48.101
- Look, you just got
a case of the yips.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.811
Your muscle memory
will kick in.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.896
- Yeah, my muscles are fine.
It's my head
that's not on right.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.024
- Well, you don't get confident
at something
by thinking about it.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.192
You gotta do it.
- I just did.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.070
Wait... Where'd you hear that?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.655
- Ah, it's just something
Austin used to say.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.408
- No, that was me.
I told him that.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.201
(sighs)

13:05.243 --> 13:07.370
- Frontier's camera crew
is going to be here tomorrow.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.706
I should not have been
bragging about how good I am.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.167
- You didn't brag,
you just said that
you can do it, and you can.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.377
- Which I... clearly, I can't!

13:14.419 --> 13:16.713
Wha... Uh, Isabel. We were just
about to do drills.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.548
- All right, look.
Forget the drills.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.550
I need you both with me
when she arrives.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.968
- She? She who?

13:22.010 --> 13:25.847
- Barbara Sutton, with her boots
and her perfect hair,

13:25.889 --> 13:27.390
and her, uh, connections.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.518
Look, she is the chair
of the gala committee this year,

13:30.560 --> 13:33.897
and her husband is Joe Sutton.
- Joe Sutton.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.774
- "The Glue" Sutton?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.026
Wasn't he the only guy
to beat Daddy's records?

13:38.068 --> 13:39.361
- Well, he's a judge now,

13:39.402 --> 13:40.945
and you want them
in your corner,

13:40.987 --> 13:43.782
otherwise you might as well just
quit while you're ahead.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.035
(horse grunting)

13:48.703 --> 13:50.413
- Come on. Come on!

13:52.415 --> 13:54.959
(light country music)

13:55.001 --> 13:57.045
(inhaling deeply)

14:01.049 --> 14:03.051
- Isabel.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.803
(sighing)
Oh...

14:07.263 --> 14:08.973
It's been too long.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.309
- Yes, yes, it has. Uh, Joe.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.019
Great to see you.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.063
So...
(clears throat)

14:16.064 --> 14:17.607
Uh, how are the kids?

14:17.649 --> 14:19.609
- Karin made partner
at her firm,

14:19.651 --> 14:21.569
and Erica just had her third.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.946
- Nice. Wow.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.782
- We'd love to spend more time
with the grandkids,

14:25.824 --> 14:29.077
but this year, I'm supplying
the bulls for the entire
southwest c--

14:29.119 --> 14:31.579
Oh, my goodness, is that Cash?
- Yeah.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.832
- Last time I saw you,
you were in diapers.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.793
(chuckles)
- Well, it's nice to meet you--
Or see you again, ma'am.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.461
Mr. Sutton.
- Mm-hmm.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.338
- Uh, this is
my daughter-in-law, Missy.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.173
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.301
- Ever since Cash returned from
overseas, he's been training...

14:45.343 --> 14:48.263
And Frontier is eyeing him
for a sponsorship.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.265
- Wow.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.726
Another bull rider
in the family, huh?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.519
- Well, it runs
in our blood, ma'am.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.313
- Well, unfortunately,
we can't actually stay long.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.482
We were hoping to take
a look at the venue.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.526
- Oh, of course. Absolutely.
Right this way.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.486
- Okay.
- Of course, yeah.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.947
(music playing softly)

15:07.032 --> 15:09.159
(indistinct chatter)

15:09.200 --> 15:11.745
- Well, it's a work
in progress,

15:11.786 --> 15:15.665
but this barn is going
to sparkle brighter
than your last venue.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.376
(scoffs)
- Now that's a tall order.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.504
- I am very familiar with
your high standards, Barbara.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.508
- You sure you want to do this?

15:25.550 --> 15:27.969
- Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.347
- I meant Cash.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.474
You really want him
to be a bull rider?

15:33.975 --> 15:36.770
- Nothing would make me prouder.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.772
- The BRL, Frontier,

15:38.813 --> 15:40.899
the appearances,
all the expectations?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.026
I don't have to tell you
how hard this life is.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.944
- You are right. You do not.

15:44.986 --> 15:48.615
- Well, I just hope you realize
my reputation is
on the line here too.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.910
- I've never let you down,
have I?

15:52.869 --> 15:55.288
- There's a first time
for everything.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.791
I sure hope this isn't it.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.543
(soft music)

16:05.757 --> 16:08.968
- Well, you seemed
to get along well with Joe.
That's good, right?

16:09.010 --> 16:11.429
- Nope. Barbara makes all
the decisions in that family.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.015
Cash, we've got to get you
gala ready.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.893
You gotta memorize who's who,
figure out your talking points.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.396
- Come on,
you can't be serious.
- No, I am, I am.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.731
Listen, you can't rest
on that last name of yours.

16:21.773 --> 16:25.110
I have a feeling it's...
it's gonna work against you
this time.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.696
(soft music)

16:35.078 --> 16:36.621
- Hey!

16:37.330 --> 16:39.833
You want a ride?
- I'm fine walking.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.128
- Is this about
your bruised ego?

16:44.129 --> 16:47.257
- What this is about
is me working my butt off
for this family

16:47.298 --> 16:49.092
for an entire year,
and where were you?

16:49.134 --> 16:50.885
- You don't think I've done
anything for this family?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.138
- I didn't say that.
But what I will say

16:53.179 --> 16:55.432
is I don't think
you've earned this.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.100
And neither do any of the guys.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.146
(sighing)

17:01.187 --> 17:04.065
- Well, you want to drink
champagne and gossip?
Be my guest.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.567
- Okay, all right. Look...

17:05.608 --> 17:07.944
People want to sponsor a rider

17:07.986 --> 17:10.780
who can give interviews and look
put together when he's doing it.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.240
- She's right.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.451
Making an impression is almost
as important as riding.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.994
- Who's side are you on now?
- Yours!

17:16.036 --> 17:17.871
- Look, you're not gonna want
to hear this,

17:17.912 --> 17:19.956
but there's gonna
be dancing at this gala.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.625
- I know how to dance.
- Yeah, I think
she means a little bit more

17:22.667 --> 17:25.045
than a dancehall two-step.
- Honey, I love you,

17:25.086 --> 17:27.839
but please, for this,
I need you to be more...

17:30.008 --> 17:31.426
- Like Austin.

17:31.468 --> 17:34.846
- No. Polished.
I was gonna say polished.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.099
(sighs)
- Okay, um...

17:38.141 --> 17:40.769
I'm gonna do what it takes
to get that barn ready,

17:40.810 --> 17:44.147
but Missy has to trick ride
for Frontier tomorrow,

17:44.189 --> 17:46.733
and you're gonna stick her
with giving me charm lessons?
Come on!

17:46.775 --> 17:48.860
- I'm happy to do it.
I will do it.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.363
I will spiff you up
faster than that barn out there.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.573
- I'm gonna get some air.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.538
(door closes)

18:05.085 --> 18:07.045
- You know, I tried to talk
to Valeria.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.714
- Mm?
- She gives up nothing.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.716
And Cash won't even hear me out.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.843
Thinks I'm just being petty...

18:13.885 --> 18:16.221
- This must be great
for that new work partnership.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.099
(chuckles)
- It's actually not bad
for productivity.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.601
We just keep one-upping
each other

18:21.643 --> 18:24.020
and see who can spiff up
the barn the fastest.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.274
- So, BRL Gala, huh?

18:28.316 --> 18:29.901
Sounds swanky.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.736
- Look, it's a really tight
guest list--

18:31.778 --> 18:34.489
- Tuff, hey,
I'm not looking for an invite.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.368
I just bet you'll look cute
in that good cowboy hat.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.496
(chuckles)

18:41.538 --> 18:43.415
Have you ever brought
a guy around?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.791
- I mean...

18:44.833 --> 18:47.085
I've been out
since I was 17...

18:47.127 --> 18:49.921
- Aw... Here I was
thinking I was so special.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.091
- You aren't?

18:53.133 --> 18:54.551
(scoffs)

18:54.592 --> 18:57.137
(chuckles)

18:57.178 --> 18:59.180
(insects chirping)

19:02.017 --> 19:03.893
(distant horse neighing)

19:05.437 --> 19:07.814
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.277
- Hope I'm not overwhelming you
with all this gala prep.

19:12.318 --> 19:16.448
- So are you gonna tell me
what's really going on with you
and Barbara?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.033
- Oh, nothing.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.410
Um, we were best friends,

19:20.452 --> 19:24.497
but then things got
kind of hard for both of us,

19:24.539 --> 19:27.250
and we drifted apart,
that's all.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.462
- Yeah, it kind of seems
like there's a little bit more
to it than that.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.422
- Well, she...
(chuckles)

19:32.464 --> 19:36.551
I mean, she has her husband
and her fabulous kids...

19:36.593 --> 19:40.805
Maybe she was afraid
she might catch my misfortune.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.059
- What? No. Isabel,
that's not...

19:44.100 --> 19:46.311
That's crazy.
- Maybe.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.063
Maybe not.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.566
Watch out for superstition.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.069
It's a powerful thing.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.864
(soft music)

20:05.872 --> 20:09.376
(light music)

20:09.417 --> 20:11.378
(indistinct chatter)

20:15.048 --> 20:16.508
- Missy!

20:17.550 --> 20:20.762
- Hey, Missy.
- Hi.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.847
- How's the barn coming?
- Oh, you'd be surprised.

20:22.889 --> 20:26.309
- No, not me.
Isabel McMurray could talk
the tarnish out of silver.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.560
- It'll be beautiful.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.979
- Well, a little more rustic
than other years.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.357
And here I went and bought
this dress from New York

20:32.399 --> 20:35.860
when I could've just got one
at that little dress store
you like, Missy.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.238
- I'm sure you'll look
lovely, Janine.

20:38.279 --> 20:42.033
- Gus and I will be curious
to see how it turns out.
He's my date.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.203
- Janine and Hank were kind
enough to invite me.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.121
- Hmm.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.081
Well, enjoy your coffees.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.418
- Missy...

20:52.502 --> 20:55.505
I hope me going to this gala
doesn't make anyone
uncomfortable.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.008
- Of course not.
You should come.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.175
- I'll see you there.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.973
(sighs)

21:06.307 --> 21:08.226
(grunting)

21:08.268 --> 21:09.894
(horse neighing)

21:09.936 --> 21:12.439
(hooves clopping)

21:13.523 --> 21:15.066
- Hey.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.068
I saw your side-by-side
out here. What're you doing?

21:17.110 --> 21:20.321
- Just paying my dues. Ha...
(chuckling)

21:20.363 --> 21:22.323
Barn's almost finished,
so I figured

21:22.365 --> 21:24.117
I'd come out here
and get this going
for the sheep.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.077
- Let a ranch hand help you.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.746
(laughing)
- Nope.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.456
No, those are Tuff's guys,
not mine.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.583
- Okay, so, you're doing
all this by yourself?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.126
- Mm-hmm.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.462
Anything to prove
I can get the job done.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.006
- Well, maybe don't try so hard
to get a job you've already got.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.090
(chuckles)
- Okay, you know what?

21:39.132 --> 21:41.259
That is actually
really bad advice.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.427
- Yeah...

21:42.469 --> 21:44.679
Well, I can't win, can I?

21:44.721 --> 21:46.473
- I don't know!

21:46.514 --> 21:48.641
You've got a whole family
working hard to make
that happen for you.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.435
Looks like you're winning to me.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.481
(upbeat music)

22:00.570 --> 22:02.989
- Morning.
- Good morning.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.996
- You want to go over
gala prep?

22:10.038 --> 22:14.376
Now that the barn's basically
ready, I, uh, I got time.

22:15.001 --> 22:19.464
- You do understand
what it took for me
to get you that bull?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.842
- I do.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.928
- Okay.

22:25.804 --> 22:28.556
- Hey. I told you,
I'm all yours, so...
- Mm-hmm.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.850
- You know, spiff me up
faster than that barn.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.645
Talking points, who's who,
what not to wear, what to wear.

22:33.687 --> 22:34.979
(chuckling)

22:35.021 --> 22:36.648
Just don't try
to school me on dancing.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.901
- Okay, God forbid. Why would I?
- I know how to dance.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.779
- Hey, what...
Get your own...

22:44.948 --> 22:46.866
- Oh, yeah.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.828
- You know, your mother
never said that she wanted you
to be Austin.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.705
- Yeah, she didn't have to.

22:51.746 --> 22:53.331
- Well, he was...

22:53.373 --> 22:56.668
He was different, not better.

22:56.710 --> 23:00.422
- Then why am I studying up
to be like him? Hmm?

23:00.463 --> 23:03.550
- Rodeo Riders Weekly?
What a textbook.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.510
(chuckling)

23:06.344 --> 23:07.721
- And those are new shoes.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.516
You know, the worn-in ones
will be easier to ride with.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.436
- Yeah, but the old ones
were just bad luck.

23:15.854 --> 23:17.689
(sighing)

23:18.815 --> 23:21.693
You know, Austin used
to call me...

23:21.735 --> 23:23.737
his good luck charm.

23:24.988 --> 23:27.198
But then, when he really
needed me, I...

23:28.575 --> 23:32.579
You know, for weeks,
months before, he was...

23:32.620 --> 23:34.789
I don't know, moody.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.834
And he'd get short with me,
and then I'd get short with him,

23:37.876 --> 23:40.879
and he was in such a bad
head space, that I can't help
but think

23:40.920 --> 23:42.714
that maybe if I had just...

23:42.756 --> 23:44.382
- What, that he...

23:44.424 --> 23:46.760
wouldn't have died if you'd done
something different?

23:46.801 --> 23:49.596
- Maybe.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.015
- Missy...

23:52.057 --> 23:54.893
- He saw us. Right before.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.062
We were just talking,
but you saw the way
that he looked at us,

23:57.103 --> 24:00.690
like there was something
going on between us,
which is crazy, but...

24:00.732 --> 24:04.486
But what if that's
what he was thinking about
when he got on that bull?

24:08.281 --> 24:10.825
- Hey, is that why you think
you can't ride, you...?

24:10.867 --> 24:12.243
(phone chiming)

24:13.495 --> 24:15.747
- Oh, it's Frontier.
They're here.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.999
- Hey, Missy. Listen to me.

24:18.583 --> 24:23.546
You can do this trick
blindfolded with a tornado
chasing after you.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.507
You got this.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.802
Okay?

24:29.886 --> 24:31.638
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

24:32.681 --> 24:34.641
- Here goes nothing.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.645
(soft music)

24:39.354 --> 24:41.356
- Missy,

24:41.398 --> 24:43.566
so thrilled
to be out here with you.

24:43.608 --> 24:46.236
- Couldn't have picked
a nicer day.
- Right?

24:46.277 --> 24:48.113
We're on a bit
of a schedule,

24:48.154 --> 24:51.658
so all we need, it's pretty
simple, is a few turns
around the pen,

24:51.700 --> 24:54.119
then the Suicide Drag,
and we're done!

24:54.160 --> 24:56.996
- Uh, that sounds great,
but I was actually thinking

24:57.038 --> 24:59.708
it might be fun
to do a tour of the ranch?

24:59.749 --> 25:02.002
You could show everybody
where Austin used to practice.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.878
- That's a great idea.
For another day.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.007
All we need is the Suicide Drag.
That's the showstopper!

25:07.048 --> 25:11.803
- Uh, right. The thing is--
- Trust me, this is what I do.

25:14.055 --> 25:16.141
Do you have somewhere
we can get you ready?

25:16.182 --> 25:18.059
- Sure, just this way.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.854
- Go, Missy!

25:20.895 --> 25:22.522
Let's see it!

25:24.816 --> 25:27.569
Hmm...

25:28.403 --> 25:29.821
(sighing)

25:32.449 --> 25:34.909
Was that a warm-up?
- No.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.911
- I don't understand.

25:36.953 --> 25:39.039
- The thing is...

25:39.080 --> 25:41.791
trick riding is as mental
as it is physical--

25:41.833 --> 25:45.211
- Sweetie, I don't need
a lesson, I need to be back
in Denver by five o'clock.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.089
This is the sort of thing
that Frontier hired you to do,

25:48.131 --> 25:50.550
so consider it
a contractual obligation.

25:51.343 --> 25:55.263
- No, see, this is what I do,
and it's dangerous.

25:55.305 --> 25:57.766
As in, if I'm not
in the zone, I could die.

25:57.807 --> 26:00.560
And I may not be a lawyer,
but as far as I'm concerned,

26:00.602 --> 26:03.855
dying for Frontier Jeans
is not a contractual obligation.

26:03.897 --> 26:07.359
- I didn't mean to pressure you.
Obviously we don't want you
to get hurt,

26:07.400 --> 26:10.028
but this crew
costs money and time...

26:10.070 --> 26:12.655
- Well, you...
you got me on horseback.

26:12.697 --> 26:16.242
- True, but that's not
what we came for.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.747
I've seen JB let people go
for far less.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.624
(Missy sighs)

26:31.966 --> 26:33.760
(cows bellowing)

26:34.636 --> 26:36.763
(grunting)

26:38.264 --> 26:40.892
- Hey!
- Hey.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.395
What are you doing here?

26:43.436 --> 26:45.105
- Oh, just looking to get lost.

26:45.146 --> 26:48.358
- Well, I'm all ears
if you help me move this trough.

26:49.818 --> 26:52.737
- I really think I messed up
my Frontier gig.

26:52.779 --> 26:56.116
I wasn't ready
to do the Drag, so I didn't.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.534
- Good for you.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.661
(scoffs)
- Thanks.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.788
Are you doing this
all by yourself?

27:01.830 --> 27:04.040
- Yeah. I kind of
have no choice.

27:04.082 --> 27:07.919
- Look, I know
we've all been hard on you,

27:07.961 --> 27:10.213
but you don't have
to prove anything.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.465
- Says the kettle to the pot.

27:12.507 --> 27:13.591
(chuckling)

27:13.633 --> 27:15.802
What's with the shoes?

27:17.512 --> 27:20.515
- I wore these
the night that Austin died.

27:21.182 --> 27:24.394
I don't know, I'm starting to
think that they're... bad luck.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.354
- Hmm.

27:29.065 --> 27:31.276
(grunting)

27:35.488 --> 27:36.906
(grunting)

27:38.366 --> 27:40.618
- Begone, you old rotten shoes!

27:40.660 --> 27:42.203
- Sayonara.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.167
(laughing)

27:48.209 --> 27:51.212
To new beginnings.

27:51.254 --> 27:53.048
- To new beginnings.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.924
(laughing)

27:57.886 --> 28:01.389
(upbeat country music)

28:01.431 --> 28:04.225
(indistinct chattering)

28:15.487 --> 28:17.739
- All right, bolo tie,
two o'clock.

28:17.781 --> 28:20.533
- Okay. Kenny Bucknam, judges
out of Twin Falls, Idaho.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.869
Two kids, loves hunting
and action movies,

28:22.911 --> 28:25.080
judges based on substance,
not style.

28:25.121 --> 28:26.706
- Very good.

28:26.748 --> 28:29.542
Now go talk to him
about Rambo or something.

28:29.584 --> 28:32.128
(chuckling)
(man): Hey, come on over!
We got some room.

28:32.170 --> 28:35.131
- Mr. Sutton.
Great to see you, sir.

28:35.173 --> 28:36.800
And uh, Mr. Buckner.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.889
- You were right.

28:42.931 --> 28:44.683
I shouldn't have doubted you,
Isabel.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.935
This place shines
like a new penny.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.104
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.733
You know, I would have invited
you to last year's gala,

28:53.775 --> 28:55.777
I just figured
you wouldn't be interested.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.570
- I wasn't.
(chuckles)

28:57.612 --> 28:59.906
But an invite
would've been nice.

29:01.825 --> 29:07.080
Look, Barbara, Cash's decision
to ride is his own,
it's not mine.

29:07.122 --> 29:10.166
But I do support my son,
no matter what.

29:11.876 --> 29:14.295
(slow country music)

29:16.381 --> 29:18.425
(indistinct chattering)

29:20.301 --> 29:23.430
- So, Joe tells me
that he's pretty much allergic
to the dance floor,

29:23.471 --> 29:26.599
but I hear that you cut
quite a rug, Mrs. Sutton,
is that true?

29:26.641 --> 29:28.810
- It is.

29:28.852 --> 29:31.146
- Well, uh, I think it would be
a darn shame

29:31.187 --> 29:33.023
to see all that talent
go to waste.

29:33.064 --> 29:35.150
Uh, care to show me your moves?

29:39.612 --> 29:41.489
(laughing)

29:41.531 --> 29:43.491
- Oh!

29:43.533 --> 29:45.994
(soft music)

29:51.041 --> 29:53.209
(sighing)

29:58.131 --> 30:01.926
- Gus is here?
- Yeah, as a plus-one.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.429
- To Janine.
(chuckling)

30:04.471 --> 30:07.724
That girl is thirstier than
a jackrabbit in the Mojave.

30:07.766 --> 30:09.684
- Be nice.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.311
- Should I...
- Get us a drink.

30:11.353 --> 30:13.271
- Yeah.

30:13.313 --> 30:17.233
- Hi, Missy, you look...
- Like you're having fun.

30:19.402 --> 30:22.238
(inaudible conversation)

30:22.280 --> 30:25.116
- Mm-hmm!
- Ah.

30:27.035 --> 30:28.787
- This place looks great.

30:28.828 --> 30:32.415
You know, the last time
I was here, I think it was
your... wedding.

30:32.457 --> 30:34.209
- I'm sure it was incredible.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.127
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, everyone said

30:36.169 --> 30:37.837
this was going to be
a total disaster,

30:37.879 --> 30:40.006
but it's actually not half-bad.

30:40.048 --> 30:42.384
You did this all
in a day and a half?
- Yeah, we did.

30:42.425 --> 30:46.054
- Wow. Imagine what we could do
to the main house with just
a smidge of effort.

30:46.096 --> 30:47.389
- "We"?

30:47.430 --> 30:50.141
- You never know
what the future holds, Missy.

30:50.684 --> 30:52.644
- Save me a dance?

30:54.187 --> 30:55.939
(chuckling)

30:57.107 --> 30:58.900
(sighing)

31:00.902 --> 31:02.612
(birds chirping)

31:02.654 --> 31:04.656
(panting)

31:07.117 --> 31:08.910
(sighing)

31:12.747 --> 31:14.374
- All right.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.501
(insects chirping)

31:21.881 --> 31:24.718
(soft music)

31:24.759 --> 31:27.178
(indistinct chattering)

31:38.690 --> 31:40.608
- You fired yet?

31:40.650 --> 31:42.444
- Any minute now.

31:42.485 --> 31:45.405
What? They hired a trick rider
who can't do a trick.

31:47.323 --> 31:50.035
- You know, growing up
with Austin,

31:50.076 --> 31:52.746
he was always the Golden Boy.
I was the screw-up.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.540
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

31:56.791 --> 31:59.461
The thing is, I wasn't always.

32:00.295 --> 32:04.257
But the more I believed
in what people were saying
about me, the more I messed up.

32:04.299 --> 32:06.426
I still do.

32:07.469 --> 32:10.388
- So what you're saying
is don't believe everything
people say?

32:10.430 --> 32:12.223
- Hmm, yes.

32:12.265 --> 32:15.477
You start to get in your head
about it.

32:16.686 --> 32:20.982
You start to feel responsible
for all the bad things
that happen.

32:23.818 --> 32:26.363
Sometimes bad things
just happen, Missy.

32:26.404 --> 32:28.990
It's no one's fault.

32:36.039 --> 32:38.166
Oh, oh, geez!
- Oh!

32:38.208 --> 32:40.418
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Hey, everyone okay?

32:40.460 --> 32:42.128
(music stops)

32:42.170 --> 32:43.880
- Well, I told you
these McMurrays were cursed.

32:43.922 --> 32:45.965
- Yeah, in and out
of the saddle.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.343
- I'm sorry, did you just say
we're cursed?

32:51.179 --> 32:53.223
- It was just a joke, son.

32:53.264 --> 32:55.058
- No, no, it didn't sound
like a joke.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.102
Why do you think we're cursed?

32:58.978 --> 33:01.648
What, because we've suffered
so much loss?

33:01.690 --> 33:05.985
Because we struggle
to keep this place we love
beneath our feet? Why, man?

33:06.027 --> 33:09.155
No, the only curse we're
suffering, far as I can tell,

33:09.197 --> 33:12.242
is allowing ourselves to be
judged by people like you.

33:13.785 --> 33:16.162
I may not be my brother,

33:16.788 --> 33:19.082
but I am part of this community.

33:19.124 --> 33:21.584
Rodeo is about family.

33:22.544 --> 33:26.047
We support each other,
we forgive past wrongs.

33:27.132 --> 33:30.719
So if you're searching
for a word to describe the
McMurrays, I'd go with "lucky".

33:35.348 --> 33:37.726
(murmuring)

33:38.810 --> 33:40.353
- Isabel?

33:41.021 --> 33:43.565
Are you going
to say something?

33:47.402 --> 33:51.156
- No. I... I think
Cash has said it all.

33:51.948 --> 33:54.200
(sighing)

33:54.242 --> 33:56.703
(indistinct chattering)

34:04.794 --> 34:06.379
(sighing)

34:06.421 --> 34:08.381
Oh, you're still here.

34:08.423 --> 34:10.383
- Well, yeah.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.636
That was one of the most
exciting galas we've ever had!

34:13.678 --> 34:15.263
- Yeah.
(chuckling)

34:15.305 --> 34:17.057
Maybe I should become
a party planner.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.933
(laughing)

34:21.394 --> 34:23.605
- Cash was pretty impressive.

34:24.939 --> 34:27.776
- Yeah. We both got lucky
with our kids.

34:31.279 --> 34:34.199
- I miss our friendship, Isabel.

34:35.784 --> 34:38.411
- I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

34:38.453 --> 34:41.956
I thought maybe you moved on
to friends who are...

34:43.166 --> 34:45.085
happier...
- No...

34:45.126 --> 34:46.544
- More together.

34:46.586 --> 34:49.214
- No, no. To be honest,
I just think...

34:51.508 --> 34:54.094
It scared me...

34:54.135 --> 34:55.762
your pain.

34:55.804 --> 34:58.723
I didn't know
how to be around you.
- Yeah, right.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.935
I-I don't know how to be
around myself sometimes.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.603
(laughing)

35:05.313 --> 35:07.148
- I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you.

35:10.193 --> 35:13.780
I don't know how much help
I can be with the BRL...

35:13.822 --> 35:16.116
- Well...
- After tonight, but...

35:19.411 --> 35:21.162
I'm here.

35:23.498 --> 35:24.958
- Thank you.

35:26.751 --> 35:30.505
I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

35:34.759 --> 35:38.847
(insects chirping,
animal howling)

35:38.888 --> 35:41.099
(sighing)

35:52.569 --> 35:55.196
- So, that happened.

35:59.701 --> 36:02.662
- You know, I was trying so hard
to show these people

36:02.704 --> 36:06.166
that I had it together
after all we've been through.

36:09.878 --> 36:12.380
- Yeah. I think it worked
like a charm.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.382
- You know, I...

36:14.424 --> 36:17.010
I put all that pressure on you.

36:17.052 --> 36:18.678
It wasn't fair.

36:22.098 --> 36:24.601
- Without the BRL...

36:25.643 --> 36:27.395
Without them in my corner,
I mean--

36:27.437 --> 36:29.022
- You know, Cash,

36:29.064 --> 36:32.817
you think I've been pushing you
to be more like Austin,

36:34.027 --> 36:36.738
but the truth is,
you are just like your daddy.

36:38.406 --> 36:41.368
And he knew exactly who he was.

36:41.409 --> 36:43.244
He couldn't pretend
to be otherwise.

36:44.037 --> 36:45.830
(chuckling)
And I...

36:46.873 --> 36:49.167
I think that's what I loved
most about him.

36:51.169 --> 36:53.171
He was always true to himself.

36:53.213 --> 36:56.800
And it did not stop him
from becoming a champion.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.767
Don't stay up too late.
- Yep.

37:11.606 --> 37:14.192
- Well, that was something.

37:14.234 --> 37:17.070
- Yeah. Where's your date?

37:17.112 --> 37:18.947
- Shh.
- Gus...

37:18.988 --> 37:20.657
Come on. That's not very
gentlemanly.

37:20.699 --> 37:23.451
- She's... just not my type.

37:23.493 --> 37:25.286
(chuckles)

37:26.788 --> 37:30.750
- Hey, uh... you see that
cluster of stars right there?

37:30.792 --> 37:34.337
They're called The Pleiades.
You see how it's kind of faded?

37:34.379 --> 37:35.880
- Uh, I think so.

37:35.922 --> 37:39.217
- That means that the wool
is going to be extra thick

37:39.259 --> 37:41.219
come shearing time next spring.

37:41.261 --> 37:43.263
- Wow.

37:43.304 --> 37:46.182
We really are so connected
to everything in the Universe--

37:46.224 --> 37:48.393
You're messing with me.
- Yeah. Well, when
the target's this easy.

37:48.435 --> 37:50.854
(laughing)

37:52.981 --> 37:55.108
- See? Maybe all you needed was
a little company to make fun of.

37:55.150 --> 37:59.029
- I was supposed to do
a trick ride today.

37:59.070 --> 38:01.656
Frontier sent
this whole camera crew and...

38:02.866 --> 38:04.784
I just couldn't do it.

38:06.661 --> 38:09.039
Really, I guess,
we should be making fun of me.

38:10.290 --> 38:13.001
- I've always believed
that if you aren't ready
for something,

38:14.044 --> 38:17.630
no matter what it was,
you can't force it.

38:17.672 --> 38:20.300
- I really do want
to ride again.

38:21.718 --> 38:23.803
It just seems unfair

38:23.845 --> 38:26.806
that some people
won't ever get to. Ever again.

38:29.642 --> 38:31.936
- You know, from everything
I've heard,

38:31.978 --> 38:35.899
sounds as if Austin
was the kind of guy who would
have wanted you to carry on.

38:37.734 --> 38:39.194
Do the things you love.

38:43.865 --> 38:47.327
I am so sorry.
You must be freezing.

38:48.453 --> 38:50.830
- Oh, thank you.

38:51.664 --> 38:52.957
- All right.

38:54.876 --> 38:57.212
* What's left to say *

38:58.922 --> 39:01.508
* What's left to do **

39:01.549 --> 39:03.843
(vehicle approaching)

39:14.187 --> 39:16.773
- No, so sorry. There's a strict
dress code here.

39:16.815 --> 39:18.441
- Oh! Oh, really?
- Yeah.

39:18.483 --> 39:20.318
- It's not two days
of caked-on dirt?

39:20.360 --> 39:22.278
(laughing)

39:22.320 --> 39:25.365
- All right, I'll let it slide
just this once.
But I got my eye on you.

39:25.407 --> 39:27.867
- Scooch over.
- Okay.

39:27.909 --> 39:29.452
(grunts)

39:30.954 --> 39:32.372
(sighs)

39:33.915 --> 39:36.876
- I hate to say it, but uh,
I should've taken your advice.

39:36.918 --> 39:39.170
- What advice was that?

39:39.212 --> 39:41.673
- That I don't have
to work so hard
for a job I already got.

39:41.715 --> 39:44.217
- Ah. Yeah.

39:44.259 --> 39:45.760
So my bad advice.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.387
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

39:47.429 --> 39:49.639
(sigh)

39:49.681 --> 39:51.808
I am sorry I missed it, though.

39:51.850 --> 39:57.355
- You should be.
Um, I basically got the entire
BRL to, uh... disown me.

39:57.397 --> 40:01.526
- Oh, I did know
that making enemies was
part of spiffing you up.

40:01.568 --> 40:03.987
(laughing)
- Yeah, it is. It is. Uh...

40:04.029 --> 40:06.114
But it was quite epic, you know.

40:06.156 --> 40:09.200
Although so was my waltz
with Babs.

40:09.242 --> 40:11.911
(laughing)
- No, you did not waltz
with her!

40:11.953 --> 40:13.455
- Yeah, I did.
- Really?

40:13.496 --> 40:14.956
- Okay, I gotta see these moves.

40:14.998 --> 40:16.958
Come on, cowboy, let's go.
Come on.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.086
Let me see what you got.
(Cash clears throat)

40:20.128 --> 40:23.715
All right. You gotta feel it
a little bit.

40:23.757 --> 40:26.009
- Uh-huh!
(upbeat music)

40:28.470 --> 40:30.597
- One of those?
- I see you.

40:30.638 --> 40:32.557
- Yeah, whatcha got?
- I see you! Okay!

40:32.599 --> 40:35.935
- Okay, what do you got?
- Uh, and uh! And uh! And uh!

40:35.977 --> 40:39.689
- Oh yeah? Oh, nice spin,
I see that spin.

40:39.731 --> 40:41.816
- Bah, bah! Bah, bah! Bah!

40:41.858 --> 40:45.612
- Valeria? You in here?
(horse grunting)

40:45.653 --> 40:47.906
Look, I wanted to apologi--

40:49.199 --> 40:50.450
Chantico.

40:53.787 --> 40:55.455
What happened here?

41:04.381 --> 41:06.591
(tense music)

41:16.226 --> 41:17.811
(laughing)

41:17.852 --> 41:20.146
(Cash humming)
- Ooh!

41:20.188 --> 41:23.483
- And around, and up like this!

41:23.525 --> 41:25.860
(laughing)
You gotta spin.
You gotta get here.

41:25.902 --> 41:28.071
There it is! Nice!

41:28.113 --> 41:31.074
- Oh my goodness.
- I'm getting dizzy.

41:31.116 --> 41:33.451
(laughing)

41:38.206 --> 41:40.917
(birds chirping)

41:40.959 --> 41:43.336
(cows bellowing)

41:43.378 --> 41:45.046
(bright music)

41:49.175 --> 41:52.846
* Saw a little dreamer,
yellow rubber boots *

41:52.887 --> 41:55.640
* You can't fake
a smile like that *

41:55.682 --> 41:59.019
* She hasn't learned how to *

41:59.060 --> 42:02.814
* Looking at the world
like a big old canvas *

42:02.856 --> 42:05.734
* Spinning full of magic *

42:06.609 --> 42:10.030
* Little more color,
a little less damage *

42:10.071 --> 42:12.282
* I miss my imagination *

42:12.323 --> 42:15.035
* I wonder how it faded *
- Okay.

42:15.076 --> 42:17.871
* I wanna worry a little less,
love a little more *

42:17.912 --> 42:20.081
* Barefoot in a dress,
dancing on the floor *

42:20.123 --> 42:21.833
Woo-hoo!

42:21.875 --> 42:25.754
* Try to be like
all the others *

42:25.795 --> 42:27.756
Woo! Yes!

42:27.797 --> 42:30.216
* Dreams and wild hair *

42:30.258 --> 42:33.720
* Yeah I know, she's still
in there somewhere *

42:33.762 --> 42:35.597
* The girl who didn't care *

42:37.057 --> 42:40.185
* The girl who didn't care *

42:41.936 --> 42:44.105
* Yeah, yeah *

42:48.276 --> 42:50.945
* I wanna worry a little less,
love a little more *

42:50.987 --> 42:53.490
* Barefoot in a dress,
dancing on the floor *

42:53.531 --> 42:58.578
* Like I did back when,
when I was younger *

42:58.620 --> 43:01.247
* Making up the songs,
playing in my head *

43:01.289 --> 43:04.459
* Didn't matter
what anybody said **
