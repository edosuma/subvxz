WEBVTT

03:23.446 --> 03:25.416
I didn't see anything!

03:25.448 --> 03:27.753
They were yelling.
They're always yelling.

03:27.784 --> 03:30.190
All I wanted was
some peace and quiet.

03:30.222 --> 03:33.359
Relax, man.
You just hit a moose.

03:33.390 --> 03:34.927
A moose?

03:34.959 --> 03:36.393
Are you sure?

03:36.426 --> 03:38.965
Yeah, man, I see this kind
of shit all the time.

03:38.966 --> 03:42.872
In fact, this ain't shit compared to
what just happened on I-95 recently.

03:42.869 --> 03:45.068
I mean, a lady hit a moose
and the motherfucker

03:45.069 --> 03:47.207
went right through
the windshield, man.

03:47.239 --> 03:48.289
No.

03:48.306 --> 03:49.840
Yeah.

03:49.872 --> 03:51.844
I was partying with my cousin.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.712
- You know...
- What kind of partying?

03:53.743 --> 03:55.713
- partying like...
- Okay.

03:55.745 --> 03:59.187
getting some hair pie
like the man from Nantucket

03:59.218 --> 04:02.690
whose dong was so long them
bitches couldn't even fuck it?

04:02.720 --> 04:05.826
And this fucking moose pissed
on my pussy parade, man.

04:05.856 --> 04:08.727
I had to come down on
a Sunday because he's sitting

04:08.758 --> 04:10.796
in the front seat of
a Volvo wide awake

04:10.828 --> 04:14.535
with his head sticking out
the cracks in the glass and shit, man.

04:14.566 --> 04:16.870
Poor guy.

04:16.903 --> 04:18.505
I had to put him down.

04:21.406 --> 04:23.511
But I got
a picture of it.

04:26.312 --> 04:28.913
I carry this shit with me now 'cause
every time I'd tell that story

04:28.914 --> 04:30.716
nobody would believe me.

04:33.852 --> 04:35.156
- Laugh it off, man.
- Okay.

04:35.189 --> 04:36.590
- This ain't shit.
- Okay.

04:36.591 --> 04:38.756
All right?
Just get the kids to school, all right?

04:38.757 --> 04:40.760
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.128
Thank you.

04:48.303 --> 04:50.305
Stop!

05:27.740 --> 05:29.644
<i>Winston, do you copy?</i>

05:29.978 --> 05:32.182
<i>Winston, do you copy?</i>

05:36.017 --> 05:37.419
Yes, sir, I'm here.

05:37.452 --> 05:39.190
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

05:39.191 --> 05:42.523
Smith Bridge Road. I'm still clearing
the scene from that bus accident.

05:42.524 --> 05:44.929
<i>I don't give a shit
if it's a handicapped bus</i>

05:44.930 --> 05:47.593
<i>and there's a bunch of
retards splattered all over the road.</i>

05:47.594 --> 05:49.298
<i>I need you back here now.</i>

05:49.330 --> 05:50.966
<i>There's a bunch
of suits up here</i>

05:50.967 --> 05:54.202
<i>asking a whole lot of big-city questions
about the way we do things.</i>

05:54.203 --> 05:55.904
<i>They were
up at the cabin this morning</i>

05:55.905 --> 05:57.805
<i>and I need to make sure
that your stupid ass</i>

05:57.806 --> 05:59.776
<i>is on the same page.
Do you get me?</i>

05:59.808 --> 06:01.810
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

09:55.217 --> 09:58.756
Sandy Taylor's fucking ridiculous.

09:59.206 --> 10:03.893
Yo- yo, John, you were
just asleep at the wheel

10:03.894 --> 10:05.362
for the hottest girl in school.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.132
Yeah, not my type.

10:07.164 --> 10:09.400
Wait, Sandy is not your type?

10:09.432 --> 10:10.867
What does that even mean?

10:10.868 --> 10:13.368
Does that mean you're gay?
Did you tell your dad?

10:13.369 --> 10:14.705
Was he bummed, or-

10:14.738 --> 10:18.112
Dude, you see her every day.
You know she's a nightmare.

10:18.141 --> 10:19.611
No, I don't know that.

10:19.612 --> 10:21.946
In fact, neither do you.
You don't even have a type,

10:21.947 --> 10:23.883
John, you have an obsession.

10:23.916 --> 10:27.455
'Cassie!
Cassie, I love you!

10:27.484 --> 10:30.155
Would you kiss me?
Would you-'

10:33.412 --> 10:36.461
Seriously, man, don't take your fucking
blue balls out on me, man.

10:36.462 --> 10:38.262
Don't think you're the only dude
here thinking about taking

10:38.263 --> 10:40.667
Miss Gorgeous to Boomtown.

10:41.298 --> 10:43.569
I actually know you are
the only person here

10:43.601 --> 10:46.172
dumb enough to take
a girl out whose ex-boyfriend

10:46.203 --> 10:48.809
does have a fucking black belt
in kicking teeth in.

10:48.841 --> 10:50.410
Look, man, I told you-

10:50.411 --> 10:52.243
there's no way that she's
gonna go with me

10:52.244 --> 10:54.677
just days after breaking up with him.
Why do you care anyway?

10:54.678 --> 10:56.482
You hate the prom,
so drop it.

10:56.483 --> 10:59.082
I know, prom blows.
But this is a whole different thing.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.188
This is important for you.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.922
You know what I mean?
This is like...

11:02.923 --> 11:05.656
Besides, it really just proves how little
you know about girls anyway.

11:05.657 --> 11:08.797
So- hey, I'm fucking talking.
Come on.

11:08.798 --> 11:13.033
If she broke up with him,
it's 'cause she finally realized

11:13.034 --> 11:15.503
how big of a fucking
douchebag the guy is.

11:15.533 --> 11:19.407
And going to prom with you, that's like
the ultimate power move, all right?

11:19.437 --> 11:21.408
You're the smartest dude
in school,

11:21.409 --> 11:23.376
you've fucking known
the girl your whole life,

11:23.377 --> 11:25.411
and you're head over heels
in love with her.

11:25.412 --> 11:27.481
All right?
I mean, come on.

11:27.513 --> 11:31.821
Spite is almost as important
to those bitches as- as money.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.255
You know what I mean?
She knows all this.

11:34.256 --> 11:36.120
I mean, now that Marc
is out of the picture,

11:36.121 --> 11:37.925
revenge is exactly
what she needs.

11:37.926 --> 11:39.960
For every single girl
in this building,

11:39.961 --> 11:42.297
that is the priority-
revenge.

11:42.298 --> 11:44.863
I mean, look at those
2 fucking savages right there.

11:44.864 --> 11:47.401
Hey.
That's how it is-

11:47.402 --> 11:49.468
All right, all right,
I'll think about it.

11:49.469 --> 11:51.502
Just fucking do it.
Shave your pussy, get it over with.

11:51.503 --> 11:54.406
I'm rallying for your fucking cause.
You need to do this thing.

11:54.407 --> 11:56.009
All right,
I'm thinking about it.

11:56.010 --> 11:57.880
You'll regret it
if you don't.

11:57.913 --> 11:59.916
Fuck.

11:59.948 --> 12:01.817
I gotta get my goggles
from the car.

12:01.818 --> 12:04.117
- Will you cover for me?
- What do you want me to say?

12:04.118 --> 12:06.289
I don't know-
I'm on my fucking period, man.

12:06.319 --> 12:07.988
Gotta get tampons.

12:08.021 --> 12:09.458
All right, well, hurry up.

12:10.791 --> 12:12.462
Whatever.

12:14.794 --> 12:17.169
Shut up. Don't say a word.

12:17.698 --> 12:19.369
Listen, people are talking.

12:19.669 --> 12:22.435
And how they're talking so soon when
it's none of their fucking business,

12:22.436 --> 12:24.839
I don't know.
But I hear things.

12:24.972 --> 12:26.909
I don't like what I hear.

12:26.943 --> 12:29.846
So you and your
bullshit friends

12:29.877 --> 12:32.149
better stay the hell
away from my girl.

12:32.179 --> 12:34.317
Do you understand me?

12:36.884 --> 12:38.420
Look, man...

12:38.452 --> 12:41.024
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay.

12:41.056 --> 12:43.127
Listen, I don't care
what she tells you

12:43.159 --> 12:45.128
or what you think
you know, she's mine.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.997
Do you get it?

12:49.764 --> 12:51.435
It's cool, man.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.069
It's cool?

12:54.536 --> 12:56.705
- Yeah.
- Really?

13:06.549 --> 13:09.086
You're dead.

13:12.319 --> 13:14.491
It's frustrating. It's frustrating.

13:14.524 --> 13:17.932
You- I'm frustrating to you.
I understand that.

13:17.962 --> 13:21.801
Honey? Honey?
Sweetie, listen to me.

13:21.831 --> 13:24.436
Angel, please
listen to me.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.336
Don't hang-
don't hang-

13:38.917 --> 13:42.410
You have anything to say for
yourself before I launch into my tirade?

13:43.719 --> 13:45.722
Nothing?

13:47.592 --> 13:50.097
There are 5 weeks
left in school.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.299
Count them-
5 weeks.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.898
And you're a smart kid.

13:53.932 --> 13:57.205
You got good grades.
You're going to college in the fall.

13:57.235 --> 14:00.039
Why would you go and do
something so stupid

14:00.070 --> 14:02.507
like start a fight?
Why?

14:02.538 --> 14:03.976
I didn't start it.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.780
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
What?

14:06.811 --> 14:08.915
I said I didn't start it.

14:14.852 --> 14:17.589
Where are you supposed
to be right now?

14:17.620 --> 14:18.656
Biology.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.161
Biology.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.228
Miss Hawker
or Mrs. Jennings?

14:22.460 --> 14:24.031
Hawker.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.803
Well, you better get
your little butt down there.

14:27.832 --> 14:30.872
Not even I can
spare you from that.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.053
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?

14:44.083 --> 14:45.589
I don't want to see you
around here again?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.320
Capiche?

14:49.353 --> 14:51.859
Now get out.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.374
Hi. I'm-

15:05.405 --> 15:10.114
Place the scalpel at
the base of the throat

15:10.144 --> 15:13.283
and carefully make a slit

15:13.313 --> 15:16.886
all the way down
the front

15:16.917 --> 15:19.021
of the frog's belly.

15:19.053 --> 15:20.622
Now...

15:20.654 --> 15:24.127
Got in trouble for
being late, by the way.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.296
Yeah, well, so did I.

15:26.327 --> 15:27.897
<i>...and tack it down...</i>

15:27.898 --> 15:30.297
I can't believe I missed
you getting your ass kicked.

15:30.298 --> 15:32.732
That was, like, right after
I talked about her too.

15:32.733 --> 15:34.803
Like telekinesis-

15:34.836 --> 15:37.006
wait, telepathy or
teleki- which one?

15:37.039 --> 15:40.010
You know, I don't really
want to talk about it, Alex.

15:40.042 --> 15:43.481
I wonder if we would wait
till I left until he kicked your ass.

15:45.147 --> 15:48.186
Somehow I don't think
it would have mattered.

15:48.187 --> 15:50.284
Yeah, you're right. I don't even know
where I was going with that.

15:50.285 --> 15:52.589
- Alex Hicks!
- Yes, ma'am?

15:52.620 --> 15:54.157
Quiet!

15:56.356 --> 15:59.430
- Sorry.
- That's strike 2!

15:59.461 --> 16:02.067
One more strike and you're
headed to the office.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.406
Mean old hag.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.680
Now make an incision

16:15.712 --> 16:17.982
through the muscular
tissue.

16:26.456 --> 16:27.924
Hey.

16:32.329 --> 16:33.999
No way.

16:46.809 --> 16:48.880
You think what they say
about Mary is true,

16:48.881 --> 16:50.180
that she's pregnant?

16:50.381 --> 16:51.188
What?

16:51.449 --> 16:53.882
Miss Hawker just told
you guys to shut up,

16:53.883 --> 16:56.489
so shut up.
I'm trying to learn.

16:57.654 --> 16:59.623
There's your prom date.

17:00.155 --> 17:01.692
Dude, you know what?

17:01.724 --> 17:04.377
Fuck what I said about taking
Cassie to the prom, man.

17:04.396 --> 17:06.465
Serious ramifications involved.

17:06.497 --> 17:07.933
Big fucking problem.

17:14.406 --> 17:16.742
Now set the heart aside.

17:18.943 --> 17:20.913
Next is the liver.

17:27.118 --> 17:29.690
Marc's a fucking douchebag.

17:31.622 --> 17:36.232
Think if our dads were millionaires,
we'd be douchebags too?

17:36.262 --> 17:38.065
I don't know.

17:38.097 --> 17:39.365
You would be.

18:21.507 --> 18:24.847
You little shit.

18:55.874 --> 18:57.947
Hey, are you all right?

18:57.979 --> 18:59.582
Yeah.

19:01.147 --> 19:02.683
No.

19:09.656 --> 19:11.259
What's the problem?

19:13.628 --> 19:16.533
I got dumped.

19:16.564 --> 19:18.433
Ungrateful shit.

19:23.472 --> 19:25.709
I don't know the guy,

19:25.740 --> 19:28.044
but anybody that
would do that to you

19:28.076 --> 19:29.913
is a fool, in my opinion.

19:29.945 --> 19:33.319
I mean, if he didn't realize
how lucky he was,

19:33.348 --> 19:36.755
then he's, like,
the stupidest guy on earth.

19:36.785 --> 19:38.154
Really?

19:38.186 --> 19:39.422
Really.

20:12.556 --> 20:15.862
Wait wait.
Wait.

20:15.892 --> 20:17.427
What's wrong?

20:19.263 --> 20:20.932
Nothing.

20:20.965 --> 20:22.701
Nothing.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.777
Sorry, it's the braces.

20:31.808 --> 20:33.044
It's cool.

21:01.940 --> 21:03.877
Hey...

21:03.908 --> 21:08.316
So what's the deal?
We gonna go to prom together or-

21:08.346 --> 21:10.349
Is that cool?

21:11.517 --> 21:13.486
No.

21:13.518 --> 21:17.192
Well, I just-
I just assumed...

21:17.222 --> 21:19.693
Look, kid,

21:19.723 --> 21:23.098
you're real nice
and sweet and everything.

21:23.129 --> 21:27.169
But this wasn't about
you and me, okay?

21:27.198 --> 21:30.438
This was about revenge.

21:30.469 --> 21:32.506
Re- revenge.

21:32.538 --> 21:33.740
Yeah.

21:33.772 --> 21:35.876
Besides, I work
for a living.

21:38.145 --> 21:42.954
Would you- would you please
go to prom with me? I mean-

21:42.983 --> 21:47.891
If I can get one of the other
girls to cover my shift,

21:47.921 --> 21:50.960
maybe I'll meet you there.

21:50.991 --> 21:52.592
How's that?

21:52.625 --> 21:55.898
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
that's awesome.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.030
That- I mean, that actually
works better for me

21:58.031 --> 22:00.335
in the long run.
That's cool. Okay.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.804
I will see you-- prom.

22:02.835 --> 22:04.705
See you there.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.317
Good afternoon,
Jonathan.

22:14.348 --> 22:16.183
Hey.

22:16.215 --> 22:17.619
Daryl, Dane.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.652
We heard about you
getting your butt kicked.

22:19.653 --> 22:21.657
Heard you cried like
a little pussy.

22:21.689 --> 22:23.858
Yeah, that's not
exactly what happened.

22:23.859 --> 22:25.458
That's not how we
were informed.

22:25.459 --> 22:27.397
Yeah, Alex said that
your little-

22:27.428 --> 22:30.034
So, is it now safe to assume

22:30.065 --> 22:32.501
that you will be coming over
tonight after all?

22:33.432 --> 22:36.275
I don't know, you guys.
It's prom night.

22:36.305 --> 22:39.177
News flash, John-
prom blows.

22:39.208 --> 22:42.112
How you gonna pass up
'Bride of the Cannibals 2:

22:42.143 --> 22:44.515
The Director's Cut'
for a gay dance?

22:44.546 --> 22:48.319
It's the most insane sequel ever made;
it's banned in over 26 countries.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.584
Can you even begin to
comprehend that awesomeness?

22:50.585 --> 22:52.419
Yeah, we heard there's
this one part

22:52.420 --> 22:54.989
where the broad with the piranha
teeth bites the guy's dick and balls.

22:54.990 --> 22:57.360
John, you see it
in a close-up.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.963
That does sound good.

22:59.995 --> 23:01.632
Yeah.

23:01.665 --> 23:05.203
But I'm still not sure
what I'm doing tonight.

23:05.204 --> 23:07.400
What do you mean you don't
know what you're doing?

23:07.401 --> 23:09.072
Prom's in, like, 5 hours.

23:09.073 --> 23:11.140
Who are you gonna ask
at this point, your mother?

23:11.141 --> 23:12.673
If Mom would let me go
to the dance,

23:12.674 --> 23:14.341
I'd be fucking so much
pussy tonight.

23:14.342 --> 23:16.548
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Cassie.

23:16.549 --> 23:18.047
Hey, do you want to
walk with me?

23:18.048 --> 23:19.784
Yeah, sure.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.351
Yeah?

23:21.384 --> 23:23.621
I'll catch you guys later.
Cool?

23:36.267 --> 23:38.069
My God, those 2 are so funny.

23:38.101 --> 23:39.435
- D8D?
- Yeah.

23:39.436 --> 23:41.703
My God, I heard Dane
scored 1,500 on his SATs.

23:41.704 --> 23:43.341
- 1,550.
- What?

23:43.374 --> 23:45.176
- Yeah.
- No way. How old is that kid?

23:45.208 --> 23:46.743
- Like 12.
- My God.

23:46.744 --> 23:48.510
Yeah, but I think he's
living proof

23:48.511 --> 23:51.051
that you can be smart
and stupid at the same time.

23:51.052 --> 23:53.182
You should see when he
and Alex get together.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.552
Alex- I haven't talked
to him in, like, forever.

23:55.553 --> 23:57.256
It's so weird.
How is he?

23:57.288 --> 23:59.358
He's good, you know?

23:59.390 --> 24:01.760
- He's still Alex.
- Yeah?

24:01.761 --> 24:04.093
Yeah, I think we're gonna
go over to their house later

24:04.094 --> 24:06.499
and watch some movies
or something.

24:06.531 --> 24:08.224
Okay. So you're not
going to prom?

24:08.234 --> 24:09.903
Nah.

24:09.935 --> 24:13.073
Yeah, me neither.

24:13.074 --> 24:14.905
Well, you'll probably
be disappearing

24:14.906 --> 24:16.841
to some amazing medical
school soon, right?

24:16.842 --> 24:18.444
I did get into Adams.

24:18.475 --> 24:20.079
- You got into Adams?
- Yeah.

24:20.110 --> 24:23.684
- My God, why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

24:23.715 --> 24:26.922
Well, congratulations. That's awesome.
That's what you wanted.

24:26.952 --> 24:28.621
Yeah, I guess it is.

24:28.953 --> 24:30.157
Thanks.

24:32.924 --> 24:35.194
So, how are you doing?

24:35.227 --> 24:37.898
- What?
- Everything.

24:37.899 --> 24:39.897
I don't know.
I mean, it's okay. I don't know.

24:39.898 --> 24:42.465
I'm fine, I don't know.
Like, relationships are hard.

24:42.466 --> 24:44.804
What can you do?
Yackety schmakety.

24:44.836 --> 24:47.608
It was the right decision, though.

24:47.639 --> 24:49.744
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:49.745 --> 24:51.110
You know, you're probably
the only person I know

24:51.111 --> 24:53.045
who's actually going to do
something with their life.

24:53.146 --> 24:56.118
- Come on, that's not true.
- No, it's true.

24:56.119 --> 24:58.551
Seriously, like, I have no
clue what I'm gonna do.

24:58.552 --> 24:59.818
Nobody does, you know?

24:59.819 --> 25:01.920
My God, everybody's going
to be so super jealous

25:01.921 --> 25:05.260
when you come back to town
and you're this really famous doctor

25:05.291 --> 25:09.298
and they're all a bunch of fat
townies with ugly babies.

25:09.299 --> 25:12.198
I'm serious. Like, even Marc was
jealous of you, you know that?

25:12.199 --> 25:15.537
Come on, Cassie,
all these compliments you're paying me

25:15.538 --> 25:17.435
are making me
a little uncomfortable.

25:17.436 --> 25:20.506
Well, you know, today's the only day
you're gonna get 'em, so enjoy.

25:20.507 --> 25:23.111
Cassie, Mom's looking for you!

25:23.142 --> 25:25.680
- Okay.
- I guess you better get going?

25:25.712 --> 25:28.785
Yeah. Well, it was
nice talking to you, John.

25:28.816 --> 25:31.187
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.
- Bye.

25:37.825 --> 25:39.995
Hey, Cassie, wait up!

25:41.128 --> 25:43.599
Hey, do you want to
go to prom with me?

25:45.267 --> 25:48.637
Look, I know you've been through a lot-
things are a mess...

25:48.668 --> 25:50.439
but it's prom,
you know?

25:50.440 --> 25:54.641
I don't know, it's the last
few weeks of high school,

25:54.642 --> 25:58.983
and I just figure it'd be the kind of
thing that we'd regret not having done.

25:59.012 --> 26:00.983
Look, I really
want to go.

26:01.015 --> 26:05.256
And you're the only person
I could see myself going with.

26:05.286 --> 26:07.456
So how about it?

26:07.488 --> 26:11.562
I can't, John.
I'm sorry.

26:11.592 --> 26:15.566
Look, if you're worried about
me getting beat up or anything,

26:15.567 --> 26:17.999
- don't worry about it.
- No, I'm not worried about that.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.202
Like, I- it's just like my brother's sick
and I've got all this stuff to do.

26:21.203 --> 26:22.905
And it's just, like,
I don't know.

26:22.938 --> 26:24.975
It's just too much,
you know?

26:25.006 --> 26:26.911
- I understand.
- Yeah?

26:26.944 --> 26:29.579
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Well, call me later.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.417
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:43.525 --> 26:46.098
'Bride of the Cannibals'
it is.

26:47.629 --> 26:49.332
Stupid.

27:02.679 --> 27:05.384
Here's your pancakes,
sweetie.

27:06.016 --> 27:07.754
Lucille.

27:07.786 --> 27:11.358
I've been dreaming about
your pancakes all day.

27:11.388 --> 27:13.492
I know, baby.

27:13.523 --> 27:16.662
That's what all
the young boys say.

27:28.539 --> 27:30.542
What the fuck, man?

27:37.548 --> 27:39.922
Bill! Bill!

27:39.953 --> 27:41.621
- Jesus.
- Okay, Bill!

27:41.653 --> 27:44.157
Deliver us from
all of this evilness!

27:44.188 --> 27:46.559
Full of the devil!
I know you did it!

27:46.590 --> 27:47.928
Bill, you gotta breathe.

27:47.959 --> 27:52.466
Breathe. Breathe.
In the name of all that is holy,

27:52.894 --> 27:54.303
hallelujah, Lord.

27:54.833 --> 27:57.471
9-1-1.

27:57.502 --> 28:00.741
God, deliver us from
these evil evil people!

28:10.644 --> 28:11.921
My God!

28:12.350 --> 28:15.959
Bill, you're in trouble!
Bill!

28:16.956 --> 28:18.994
The ambulance
will be right here.

28:19.026 --> 28:21.129
Bill, I know where
you come from, Bill.

28:21.159 --> 28:23.199
<i>I know you're-
come on, Bill!</i>

28:24.429 --> 28:27.469
<i>Hallelujah! Hallelujah!</i>

28:34.908 --> 28:36.010
Shit.

28:36.044 --> 28:39.649
This is bad news.
This is real bad news.

29:41.676 --> 29:42.945
Yeah?

29:42.978 --> 29:45.114
I hope you're dressed.
I have got big news.

29:45.146 --> 29:48.486
The entire team is going
to the prom after all.

29:48.516 --> 29:50.787
So there's an 'I'
in team now?

29:50.819 --> 29:53.524
John, don't try to be funny.
You're not good at it.

29:53.556 --> 29:55.894
You're just not good at it.
Hey, don't hang up.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.063
I didn't mean that.
No no no no no no.

29:58.094 --> 29:59.628
John? John?

29:59.661 --> 30:03.535
- Spit it out.
- Funny you should say that actually.

30:13.876 --> 30:16.348
All you need to know is
that I have a date for prom.

30:16.378 --> 30:18.849
You need to get your ass
out of fucking bed,

30:18.881 --> 30:21.653
get on a suit and tie,
and that's it.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.520
You know, after listening to you
rag on prom for the last week,

30:24.521 --> 30:26.658
I think I finally came around.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.428
Prom blows.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.789
That was a lot of rings.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.793
- I'm gonna go now.
- No, no, dude, come on.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.694
Dude, please.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.730
Please? You can't let me
go to this by myself.

31:04.731 --> 31:07.464
You're my best friend. You can't do that.
It's not in the book.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.603
You can't do this.
Please, man.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.306
Please.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.505
- Please?
- All right.

31:13.537 --> 31:16.243
I'll go.

31:16.276 --> 31:19.148
Thank God.

33:00.982 --> 33:03.720
- Hey.
- Who goes there?

33:03.751 --> 33:06.491
Police.
Open up.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.128
Okay.

33:09.658 --> 33:11.161
Come on.

33:11.194 --> 33:13.096
Hey, look, she said she was 18.

33:13.097 --> 33:14.861
I always believe what
children say.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.897
No, man, I need to see
your delivery schedule.

33:16.898 --> 33:18.969
- Open the fucking gate. Come on.
- Okay.

33:19.001 --> 33:21.204
Okay, all right.

33:21.236 --> 33:23.609
I got the key right here.

33:23.639 --> 33:25.542
- No, wrong key.
- Come on, man.

33:25.543 --> 33:27.276
- It's a fucking emergency.
- I found it.

33:27.277 --> 33:29.647
No. Maybe it's this one.

33:31.947 --> 33:33.784
Son of a bitch.

33:33.816 --> 33:35.419
Looks like that one.
Here it is.

33:41.891 --> 33:43.562
Gross.

34:16.661 --> 34:17.797
Hey.

34:20.096 --> 34:22.467
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

34:22.498 --> 34:23.766
Rick.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.737
What are you
doing here?

34:25.768 --> 34:28.509
What do you mean?
I came to see you.

34:29.842 --> 34:31.077
Me?

34:31.109 --> 34:33.313
Yeah.
Is that not okay?

34:33.346 --> 34:36.918
No. I mean, yes.
I mean, what about Sandy?

34:37.148 --> 34:40.654
She's busy preparing
her prom queen speech.

34:40.684 --> 34:42.355
Couldn't take it.

34:42.386 --> 34:45.826
Plus I wanted
to talk to you.

34:45.857 --> 34:47.493
Really?

34:47.525 --> 34:49.362
Sure.

34:49.395 --> 34:52.033
Yeah, the place-
it looks really great.

34:52.065 --> 34:54.034
You do great work.

34:54.065 --> 34:55.868
You think so?

34:55.900 --> 34:57.603
Yeah.

34:57.635 --> 34:59.372
It's beautiful.

35:16.222 --> 35:20.531
Ungrateful little shits.

35:27.300 --> 35:29.003
Come on.

35:29.035 --> 35:32.206
- What if the teachers show up?
- To the pool?

35:34.475 --> 35:36.312
Get 'em off.

35:57.999 --> 36:01.037
Come on!
It's beautiful!

37:10.673 --> 37:13.880
- Rick.
- Frederica.

37:13.911 --> 37:15.713
I want to fuck you.

37:15.746 --> 37:17.950
Wait, do you
have a condom?

37:17.981 --> 37:20.585
I'll pull out.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.623
What?
What's wrong?

37:26.957 --> 37:28.497
Are you on your period?

37:28.526 --> 37:30.230
No, I'm a virgin.

37:42.439 --> 37:44.377
- What- what now?
- Fuck!

37:44.409 --> 37:46.513
My tooth.

37:47.546 --> 37:49.048
What the fuck?

37:49.080 --> 37:51.083
My God, help me!

37:51.115 --> 37:53.085
Stay away from me.

37:53.117 --> 37:54.819
Rick, help me.

37:54.851 --> 37:56.487
What is wrong with you?

37:56.488 --> 37:58.621
I bet my friends that
you would be an easy fuck,

37:58.622 --> 38:01.228
not that you would be
all fucked up!

38:03.429 --> 38:05.232
Help me!

38:05.264 --> 38:07.735
You bled in my mouth!

38:19.647 --> 38:21.648
Frederica?

38:22.715 --> 38:25.387
Frederica, stop it!

38:27.686 --> 38:29.290
Shit.

38:30.521 --> 38:32.325
Frederica!

38:33.927 --> 38:36.031
Frederica!

38:37.530 --> 38:39.000
Shit.

39:09.229 --> 39:10.399
Fuck!

39:10.431 --> 39:12.468
He cleans up real good?

39:12.500 --> 39:14.337
Where did you get that?

39:14.568 --> 39:16.873
My mom got it down
from the attic.

39:16.905 --> 39:19.540
Well, it's very dapper.

39:19.572 --> 39:21.376
Dapper? I like that.

39:25.681 --> 39:27.783
So should we just call it?

39:27.784 --> 39:29.849
Head over to D8D's and
watch movies all night?

39:29.850 --> 39:31.319
Yeah, we should.

39:33.522 --> 39:35.690
Well, fuck that,
motherfucker!

39:35.722 --> 39:38.796
We're gonna get laid tonight.
I got a sure thing in there.

39:38.826 --> 39:41.132
Come on.
This is it, baby-

39:41.133 --> 39:44.064
one last night to hate your life just
a little bit fucking more.

39:44.065 --> 39:45.500
This is it, motherfucker.

39:45.534 --> 39:49.609
2 men going to prom together.
It's exactly as it should be.

39:55.844 --> 39:59.250
Shit, man. Paperwork's
never been my thing.

39:59.282 --> 40:02.788
Hey, careful with
those files.

40:02.819 --> 40:05.391
Hey, I'm just the night guard.

40:05.392 --> 40:07.620
I don't know anything about
any of that stuff.

40:07.621 --> 40:11.498
If this is about some kind
of bookkeeping cover-up or whatever,

40:11.528 --> 40:13.231
I don't know nothing
about that.

40:13.263 --> 40:14.797
Just, you know,
say no.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.802
Hey, you haven't seen
my application

40:16.803 --> 40:18.899
floating around at the station,
have you?

40:18.901 --> 40:20.870
I sent one in like 6 months ago.

40:20.903 --> 40:23.873
- Hey, what's today?
- Friday.

40:23.905 --> 40:25.441
No, the fucking date, man.

40:27.543 --> 40:30.016
Jesus! Shit!

40:33.783 --> 40:35.555
Daddy.

40:35.956 --> 40:37.787
You got another
fucking beer, man?

40:37.788 --> 40:39.991
My secret stash.

40:41.991 --> 40:44.261
Yeah.
All right.

40:44.293 --> 40:45.730
Yeah.

40:47.865 --> 40:49.500
Can I use your phone?

40:49.532 --> 40:51.336
Yeah, just dial 9,

40:51.368 --> 40:54.741
then you'll hear a dial tone,
then you dial the area code

40:54.742 --> 40:57.473
and then your number.
It's different than a regular phone.

40:57.474 --> 40:59.212
- Is it working?
- Herman.

40:59.244 --> 41:01.413
It's me, Winston.

41:01.445 --> 41:03.918
Hey, man, I'm in some deep
fucking shit down here.

41:03.947 --> 41:06.851
You gotta help me.
Man, turn down the 'Sepulter'

41:06.884 --> 41:08.788
and listen to me,
motherfucker!

41:08.820 --> 41:11.259
No, I'm fucking
serious, man.

41:11.290 --> 41:13.892
- I-
- Hey, these guys with you?

41:13.924 --> 41:15.694
Hold on.

41:16.694 --> 41:18.464
No.

41:18.496 --> 41:20.632
Fuck, man!

41:21.966 --> 41:24.604
Now do me a fucking favor,
Man.

41:24.637 --> 41:26.673
You gotta tell
these motherfuckers

41:26.704 --> 41:29.810
that the water coming out
of here is bad news.

41:29.841 --> 41:32.147
They cannot deliver it.
Do you understand me?

41:32.177 --> 41:33.478
Why do I gotta tell them?

41:33.511 --> 41:35.849
Man, it's jurisdiction
bullshit, you know?

41:35.881 --> 41:38.453
Beaurocracy. Okay.

41:38.484 --> 41:42.393
Look, man, you're gonna be
a fucking hero for this.

41:42.724 --> 41:46.223
Now, what kind of pussy
you're gonna get for this?

41:46.224 --> 41:48.395
Man, you're gonna get the sashimi.

41:48.427 --> 41:49.862
What's that?

41:49.895 --> 41:52.500
Man, that's the primo pussy, man-

41:52.530 --> 41:54.468
no smell.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.003
Fucking hero, man.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.473
Yeah. Thanks, man.

42:02.206 --> 42:04.043
The water here is bull-

42:58.899 --> 43:01.605
So where is your hot date?

43:01.636 --> 43:03.638
She's late.

43:06.407 --> 43:09.781
Or not fucking coming.

43:09.811 --> 43:12.283
I'm gonna go get
some punch.

43:12.314 --> 43:14.919
Do you want some more?

43:14.951 --> 43:17.923
No, it tastes like
someone pissed in it.

43:17.954 --> 43:20.658
I'm gonna go
lower my standards.

43:33.335 --> 43:34.638
I can't find Rick!

43:34.670 --> 43:36.976
I am not gonna be
embarrassed on that stage!

43:37.008 --> 43:38.475
I am the prom queen

43:38.507 --> 43:40.210
and he's the prom king!

43:40.242 --> 43:42.246
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?

43:42.278 --> 43:45.150
Sandy, nobody's trying
to ruin your life.

43:45.151 --> 43:46.815
Perhaps he's just
in the boys' room.

43:46.816 --> 43:49.055
Just calm down.

43:49.086 --> 43:51.056
Miss Hawker?

43:56.192 --> 43:58.028
Guess who.

43:58.061 --> 43:59.431
Cassie?

43:59.463 --> 44:01.666
- It's me!
- Cassie!

44:01.697 --> 44:03.567
- You're here!
- I'm here!

44:03.599 --> 44:06.072
- Yeah, I changed my mind.
- Have some punch.

44:06.103 --> 44:08.674
Thanks. Yeah, I thought
about what you said today.

44:08.705 --> 44:11.977
I don't know, I just thought,
you're right. You know? It's prom.

44:12.009 --> 44:15.014
That's so great.
I'm so glad that you're here.

44:15.045 --> 44:17.350
- Great.
- Hey, baby.

44:17.381 --> 44:21.155
Hey, John. Sweetheart, do you think you
can give John and I a minute?

44:21.185 --> 44:24.625
Because I would really like
to apologize to him too.

44:24.656 --> 44:26.459
- I'll just be a minute.
- Okay.

44:26.491 --> 44:27.558
- Okay?
- Yeah.

44:27.591 --> 44:29.227
I'll bring you
a fresh cup.

44:29.259 --> 44:30.594
Bye, John.

44:38.003 --> 44:40.341
Are you trying to
be an asshole?

44:40.372 --> 44:43.744
I told you to
stay away from her.

44:43.745 --> 44:46.175
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

44:46.176 --> 44:49.483
Could you?

44:49.484 --> 44:52.882
You want to know something about
the girl of your dreams over there?

44:52.883 --> 44:55.991
Not only is she
here with me and not you,

44:56.021 --> 44:58.058
but I'm gonna be
fucking her tonight.

44:58.059 --> 45:00.190
I'm gonna take her home
and I'm gonna fuck her

45:00.191 --> 45:02.229
every which way I want
because I can.

45:02.261 --> 45:05.433
And no matter what I do,
she's always gonna come back to me.

45:05.464 --> 45:07.666
What do you think about that?

45:13.139 --> 45:14.012
What?

45:14.340 --> 45:16.211
Do you like that, faggot?

45:16.241 --> 45:18.011
Stop this!

45:18.043 --> 45:20.848
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you, man!

45:20.880 --> 45:22.650
- Fuck you!
- What did you do?

45:22.651 --> 45:24.781
- Cassie, I didn't do anything.
- That's a lie!

45:24.782 --> 45:27.421
You did something.
Why do you always have to fight?

45:27.453 --> 45:28.856
Asshole!

45:28.889 --> 45:31.060
You hit like
your fucking boyfriend.

45:34.426 --> 45:36.497
I didn't fucking do anything!

45:36.530 --> 45:38.902
This is bullshit!
He fucking started it!

45:38.903 --> 45:41.001
Watch your mouth!
This is the second time today

45:41.002 --> 45:42.534
I've had to deal with
this nonsense from you.

45:42.535 --> 45:45.171
You're out of here. I will not tolerate
this barbaric behavior-

45:45.172 --> 45:48.212
- Are you fucking blind? He started it!
- Out out!

45:48.241 --> 45:52.147
I am out!
I can't get any more out than this!

45:53.414 --> 45:56.218
School sucks!

45:56.249 --> 45:58.620
John, wait!

45:58.652 --> 46:00.722
Will you wait?
Wait!

46:03.357 --> 46:05.359
Jesus Christ.

46:51.540 --> 46:52.546
John!

46:53.040 --> 46:54.646
John, will you wait?

46:55.177 --> 46:57.582
Will you just wait?
John!

46:57.613 --> 47:00.151
What, Cassie?
What? What do you want?

47:00.152 --> 47:01.816
- I'm just sorry.
- You're sorry?

47:01.817 --> 47:03.603
You're sorry for what? You're sorry
that I get blamed for everything

47:03.656 --> 47:05.989
or you're sorry that your
boyfriend's a fucking asshole?

47:06.390 --> 47:09.925
Or you're sorry that
you're too stupid to tell the difference?

47:09.926 --> 47:10.931
Is that it?

47:12.231 --> 47:14.264
You gotta be a little
clearer with me tonight

47:14.265 --> 47:16.065
because I've got
a bit of a headache!

47:16.066 --> 47:18.702
- John!
- Fuck you!

47:18.734 --> 47:22.476
He is the worst human being
in this fucking school,

47:22.505 --> 47:25.476
and you are the best.

47:25.507 --> 47:26.979
Now how does that work?

47:30.446 --> 47:32.616
No, I want to know
about that process-

47:32.649 --> 47:34.251
what goes through your head.

47:34.284 --> 47:37.691
How you can not like me, someone
you've known for your entire life,

47:37.692 --> 47:39.923
someone who would treat you
like an absolute queen,

47:39.924 --> 47:43.129
and instead go for
that piece of shit back there.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.998
Why?

47:45.030 --> 47:47.535
Because he's rich?
Because he's popular?

47:47.565 --> 47:50.835
I mean, Jesus, Cassie,
you're not even poor.

47:50.867 --> 47:53.173
I mean, how obvious
does it have to be?

47:53.204 --> 47:55.609
You would have to be
practically retarded

47:55.640 --> 47:57.842
not to see that
I'm in love with you.

47:57.874 --> 47:59.510
Everybody sees it.

47:59.542 --> 48:02.316
Marc sees it.

48:02.347 --> 48:06.052
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that is?

48:06.083 --> 48:07.786
No.

48:07.818 --> 48:10.157
No, of course you don't.

48:10.189 --> 48:12.560
I'm done with it.
It's over.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.429
I can't take it anymore,
Cassie.

48:21.766 --> 48:24.438
Hey, kids, you're gonna
have to get back inside.

48:24.439 --> 48:26.603
Yo, we're having
a conversation here, asshole.

48:26.604 --> 48:28.441
Not anymore.
It's over.

48:28.442 --> 48:30.975
You need to get your girlfriend
and take her back inside.

48:30.976 --> 48:33.577
That's not my girlfriend, all right, man?
I'm going home.

48:33.578 --> 48:36.419
Stop!

48:36.450 --> 48:38.584
Get inside now!

48:38.615 --> 48:40.051
All right.

48:44.790 --> 48:47.060
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

48:49.096 --> 48:51.567
I have a bad feeling.
We gotta get out of here.

48:51.597 --> 48:53.001
Go.

49:44.318 --> 49:45.988
Who are they?

49:51.926 --> 49:54.797
I don't know.

49:54.828 --> 49:58.137
But I don't think
that they're cops.

49:58.168 --> 50:01.306
Now I need you to go
in there and get Alex, okay?

50:01.336 --> 50:04.008
No matter what he says,
you get him out of there.

50:04.009 --> 50:06.040
You drag him by the hair
if you have to, okay?

50:06.041 --> 50:07.910
Okay. But what about
everyone else?

50:07.911 --> 50:09.945
I'm gonna tell Principal
St. Clair what's going on,

50:09.946 --> 50:12.046
but I'm not staying here
any longer than that.

50:12.047 --> 50:14.250
No matter what he says,
we're getting out of here, okay?

50:14.251 --> 50:15.585
Okay.

50:25.361 --> 50:27.966
- Alex! Alex!
- Cassie, have you seen John?

50:27.997 --> 50:31.170
You've got to come outside
with me right now, okay?

50:31.202 --> 50:34.975
You just fucking
cockblocked me.

50:43.746 --> 50:46.418
Okay. Don't get kicked out of prom.
Just come with me.

50:46.450 --> 50:48.287
- All right.
- God!

51:03.501 --> 51:05.839
Well, well, well.

51:05.870 --> 51:07.340
It is time

51:07.672 --> 51:10.142
to announce the prom king

51:10.174 --> 51:12.678
and the prom queen!

51:18.350 --> 51:20.788
Freak!

51:29.693 --> 51:31.963
God, what is
taking him so long?

51:31.964 --> 51:35.600
So what are you talking about?
There's dead bodies in here or something?

51:35.601 --> 51:37.603
You're not listening to me!

51:37.604 --> 51:39.104
I've had more than enough
of this from you!

51:39.105 --> 51:40.739
- I told you to go home.
- Back off!

51:40.771 --> 51:43.543
All right?
Now there's a dead body in the pool

51:43.544 --> 51:45.607
and there's people
surrounding the school!

51:45.608 --> 51:47.112
All right?
Do something!

51:47.113 --> 51:49.013
Come on, boy, what kind
of fool do you take me for?

51:49.014 --> 51:51.048
Principal St. Clair, there are people
with guns outside-

51:51.049 --> 51:52.684
men in vans with guns!
Will you just look?

51:52.685 --> 51:53.987
All right, wait a minute.

51:54.020 --> 51:56.124
Stay right here.
Do not move.

51:56.155 --> 51:57.924
Go!

51:59.125 --> 52:01.829
What the hell is going on?

52:01.860 --> 52:04.365
They locked the doors!

52:04.397 --> 52:06.634
Wait, what?
We're fucking trapped?

52:06.665 --> 52:08.837
What's going on out there?

52:12.040 --> 52:14.009
I'm the principal
of this school!

52:14.041 --> 52:16.077
I demand to know
what's going on.

52:35.895 --> 52:39.402
Who is that girl?
Why is everyone looking at her?

52:39.433 --> 52:41.539
This is supposed to be
my big night!

53:30.321 --> 53:32.791
Help me.

53:33.822 --> 53:35.524
Help me!

53:36.558 --> 53:38.061
Help.

54:05.580 --> 54:10.392
What, is this fucking
terrorism or something?

54:10.393 --> 54:11.862
Why'd they lock us in?

54:11.893 --> 54:14.248
We just need to find
a phone- we need to get help.

54:14.249 --> 54:16.332
No, we need to get out of here before
they can lock all the doors.

54:16.333 --> 54:18.036
Art room has outside doors.

54:18.037 --> 54:20.069
No, the auditorium's way better
'cause it leads out back.

54:20.070 --> 54:23.477
What, is this contagious?
Did you see that guy's fucking face?

54:23.478 --> 54:25.874
I don't know, man.
You don't look sick. Neither do you.

54:25.875 --> 54:26.977
What the fuck?

54:26.978 --> 54:30.013
Last time I checked kids were
taking trench coats to school,

54:30.014 --> 54:31.983
not fucking biological
weapons!

54:50.968 --> 54:52.972
- My back.
- Okay, all right.

54:54.372 --> 54:56.109
We need to get out of here.

54:56.141 --> 54:58.144
They're here!
They're here!

55:16.962 --> 55:18.965
- Look.
- What?

55:27.640 --> 55:29.014
No, no...

55:29.840 --> 55:31.313
Fuck.

55:31.343 --> 55:34.149
No, no, no...

55:34.180 --> 55:36.584
Stupid fucking bitch.

55:36.616 --> 55:37.919
That fucking bitch.

55:39.884 --> 55:42.457
Fucking bitch.

55:42.488 --> 55:44.493
Fucking...

55:44.526 --> 55:45.693
Fuck.

55:45.726 --> 55:48.019
What do I fucking do?
Don't fucking look at it.

55:48.028 --> 55:49.863
What the fuck?

55:49.895 --> 55:51.399
God.

55:51.400 --> 55:53.065
I need to go to
the fucking library.

55:53.066 --> 55:56.235
I need to get those medical books-
those books you always use, right?

55:56.236 --> 55:58.307
- Fuck!
- It's not an STD!

55:58.339 --> 56:00.876
You need a doctor,
not a book! Cassie!

56:00.909 --> 56:02.410
Cassie!

56:19.294 --> 56:21.562
Something is wrong.

56:21.594 --> 56:24.367
Something is very wrong.

56:27.534 --> 56:29.505
I had the baby.

56:29.537 --> 56:33.312
Please help me, please!

56:34.442 --> 56:36.947
- I- I can't help you.
- Please!

56:36.978 --> 56:41.051
- You're sick, I can't-
- My baby! I don't know what to do!

56:55.663 --> 56:57.467
Please!

56:59.801 --> 57:01.939
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

57:01.970 --> 57:04.209
Get away from me!

57:06.508 --> 57:08.278
Don't come any closer!

57:08.310 --> 57:11.984
Don't move, please!

57:12.014 --> 57:16.423
- Please, please...
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

57:21.492 --> 57:23.229
God.

57:23.261 --> 57:25.031
Cassie!

57:58.963 --> 58:01.766
Get the fuck down, man!
Get your ass out of sight.

58:01.798 --> 58:05.173
No, man!
What's your problem?

58:05.202 --> 58:08.174
I'm a fucking
chick magnet, man.

58:08.175 --> 58:10.374
And this fucking world's
coming to an end,

58:10.375 --> 58:12.378
and we gotta get
the fuck out of Dodge.

58:12.379 --> 58:13.678
No, don't do this
to me, man.

58:13.679 --> 58:16.045
I just came down here
to pick your silly ass up, man.

58:16.046 --> 58:18.050
What is this, man?

58:18.581 --> 58:21.021
Light beer.
You are pathetic.

58:21.052 --> 58:22.522
Take that back.

58:22.554 --> 58:24.858
Listen, man, I got
everything figured out.

58:24.890 --> 58:27.362
I got my paperwork
out of that fucking office.

58:27.393 --> 58:30.198
They're not even gonna know
I was ever here, man.

58:30.199 --> 58:32.096
Yeah, well, I hate to rain
on your parade-

58:32.097 --> 58:34.864
you just don't quit the police force
without somebody noticing, man.

58:34.865 --> 58:36.100
You ever think
about that?

58:36.101 --> 58:38.435
Up until this afternoon
I was a fucking cop, remember?

58:38.436 --> 58:40.474
I know how this fucking
bullshit works.

58:40.475 --> 58:42.674
I got it all covered.
Just get the fuck out of here.

58:42.675 --> 58:45.912
You sure about this, Charlie, man?
This is gonna be a mighty tall order.

58:45.913 --> 58:48.217
Let's roll, man.
It's cool.

58:48.247 --> 58:49.916
All right then.

58:52.150 --> 58:53.752
Where are we headed?

01:00:17.908 --> 01:00:19.443
Come on.

01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:41.666
Are those gunshots?

01:00:41.697 --> 01:00:43.100
Come on.

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.678
Please be quiet.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.815
My-- my legs!

01:00:55.847 --> 01:00:57.782
They're going out!

01:00:57.813 --> 01:00:59.151
I made it!

01:00:59.183 --> 01:01:01.685
Please, please help me!

01:01:01.718 --> 01:01:03.888
Help me!

01:01:05.888 --> 01:01:06.926
I made it!

01:01:07.756 --> 01:01:09.230
I made it!

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.201
Please!
Please help me!

01:01:26.543 --> 01:01:28.247
Please!

01:02:05.816 --> 01:02:07.820
- Alex!
- Alex!

01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:16.064
Shit! He's not here!
He's in the library.

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.462
He's sick, all right?
Whatever it is, he's got it

01:02:18.463 --> 01:02:20.933
and he's convinced that he can
save himself if he knows what it is.

01:02:20.934 --> 01:02:23.135
He thinks I can help him.
I can't fucking help him!

01:02:23.136 --> 01:02:26.141
Fuck! I never should
have let him go!

01:02:27.372 --> 01:02:29.710
You know I can't leave him?
You know that?

01:02:29.742 --> 01:02:31.479
Let's just go and
get him then.

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:07.083
- Hey. Hey.
- John.

01:03:07.114 --> 01:03:09.954
Have you seen my date?
'Cause I'd like to give her

01:03:09.985 --> 01:03:11.587
some of my mind.

01:03:32.073 --> 01:03:33.775
No!

01:03:35.944 --> 01:03:37.714
Doors, doors!

01:03:37.746 --> 01:03:39.583
Cassie, please!
Come on, it's me!

01:03:39.614 --> 01:03:42.686
- Hey, hey!
- Don't fucking touch me, John!

01:03:42.717 --> 01:03:45.490
- Cassie!
- It's a skin disease, man.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.689
It's a skin disease.

01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:51.797
They're in the building.
You gotta get out of here!

01:03:51.798 --> 01:03:54.063
- You gotta get out of here.
- Cassie, open the door!

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:57.437
You gotta get out of here.
They're shooting people, John.

01:03:59.568 --> 01:04:02.540
Open the doors
right now!

01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:04.140
Open them!

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.845
Cassie? Cassie?

01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:09.046
- Come on, it's me!
- I can't. You might be sick.

01:04:09.047 --> 01:04:12.185
No, no! I'm not sick.
I'm fine. Please!

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:15.487
Please! Open the fucking
door right now.

01:04:15.488 --> 01:04:17.887
Do you hear me?
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:20.223
Open this door right now!

01:04:20.255 --> 01:04:23.329
Will you fucking shut up?
Go away!

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.029
Open the door.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.434
I can't!

01:04:30.435 --> 01:04:33.502
Look on the bright side, John-
if I hadn't made you go to prom,

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:36.275
you wouldn't have ended up
with the girl of your dreams.

01:04:37.572 --> 01:04:41.182
Cassie, do you hear me?
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

01:04:41.213 --> 01:04:43.784
You open this door
right now!

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:50.626
Cassie, please come on. You gotta
open this door. You gotta let me in.

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:53.790
Now!

01:04:55.928 --> 01:04:58.265
Cassie, please come on.
Listen, I can help you.

01:04:58.266 --> 01:05:00.497
Listen to what
I'm saying to you. This is me here.

01:05:00.498 --> 01:05:01.901
I can help you.

01:05:47.381 --> 01:05:49.383
Let's go.

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:52.619
Come on!

01:06:01.996 --> 01:06:04.529
No one's being allowed through.
The road's closed.

01:06:04.532 --> 01:06:06.067
It's an emergency
situation.

01:06:06.068 --> 01:06:08.101
Come on, pal.
We're already late for the wedding.

01:06:08.102 --> 01:06:10.206
- Cut us some slack.
- No can do.

01:06:10.237 --> 01:06:14.144
Strict orders. You need to turn around
and head back right now.

01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:17.246
This is fucked, man.
We gotta get out of here.

01:06:17.277 --> 01:06:20.051
Don't worry about it, cousin.
I'll handle this.

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:25.888
Excuse me, officer?

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.426
Why don't you step into
my office for a minute?

01:06:29.457 --> 01:06:31.427
Listen, I'm a businessman

01:06:31.459 --> 01:06:35.234
and what do you say we
work something out, okay?

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.367
Butterfingers.

01:06:56.952 --> 01:06:58.587
Move it now!

01:07:00.356 --> 01:07:01.825
Where are we going?

01:07:01.857 --> 01:07:04.161
I need you to
do something for me.

01:07:19.741 --> 01:07:21.410
It's gonna go really fast

01:07:21.443 --> 01:07:24.784
and then I'm gonna go
into shock, okay?

01:07:24.814 --> 01:07:26.417
You're gonna have to do this.

01:07:28.817 --> 01:07:30.287
Okay?

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.439
What I said before?

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.841
I didn't mean it.

01:08:23.872 --> 01:08:25.477
Yeah, you did.

01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:37.557
Move, motherfucker!

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:40.261
I'm gonna crack your
fucking skull, bitch!

01:08:40.291 --> 01:08:43.229
Do you fucking hear me?
Okay?

01:08:43.261 --> 01:08:45.232
Put your fucking
head down, man!

01:08:45.264 --> 01:08:47.535
Fuckin' hit me, motherfucker!

01:08:47.567 --> 01:08:48.901
Yeah, come on, man!

01:08:48.933 --> 01:08:51.505
Yeah, yeah!
You gettin' warm, motherfucker!

01:08:51.506 --> 01:08:53.770
I gave you everything!
You were nothing before me!

01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:57.678
You think you can just
drop me because you fucking feel like it?

01:08:57.709 --> 01:09:00.348
What about my feelings?

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.953
What the fuck?
What the fuck? Feelings!

01:09:03.983 --> 01:09:06.587
How could you fucking
do this to me?

01:09:06.819 --> 01:09:09.024
I fucking loved you!

01:09:09.055 --> 01:09:11.894
- Cassie!
- You don't break up with me!

01:09:11.926 --> 01:09:15.231
Nobody breaks up with me!
Okay?

01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:18.100
What the fuck does he
have that I don't?

01:09:18.131 --> 01:09:21.069
I want to fucking know!
Do it, bitch!

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:18.828
Just a little bit further.
You've gotta get up.

01:10:18.858 --> 01:10:21.164
I lost too much blood.

01:10:21.196 --> 01:10:23.100
You've got to
get out of here.

01:10:23.132 --> 01:10:24.868
Go, go.

01:10:24.901 --> 01:10:27.204
Just come on, come on.
You're gonna be fine.

01:10:27.235 --> 01:10:29.205
- You gotta go.
- No.

01:10:29.237 --> 01:10:32.611
- Get up.
- He's there! Get him on the horn!

01:10:32.642 --> 01:10:36.382
No. John, we've got to go.
We gotta go.

01:10:36.411 --> 01:10:38.449
Come on, come on...

01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:45.223
No, no, no!

01:10:45.255 --> 01:10:48.828
No, no...

01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:52.529
Go, go, go!

01:10:52.562 --> 01:10:56.403
Go! Run!

01:10:57.433 --> 01:10:58.641
Run!

01:10:59.702 --> 01:11:02.507
Run!
Fuck you!

01:11:39.809 --> 01:11:43.852
Somebody!
Please! Please!

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:47.120
Please, help me!
Please!

01:11:47.151 --> 01:11:50.525
Stop the car!
Please! Please!

01:11:50.555 --> 01:11:53.395
Please stop the car!
Please, please!

01:11:53.425 --> 01:11:55.996
Stop, stop!
Please!

01:11:56.027 --> 01:11:57.562
What seems to be
the trouble?

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.797
I need to go to the hospital.
Please help me, please!

01:11:59.798 --> 01:12:02.166
What the fuck happened?
Your old man kicked you around?

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:05.006
No, I just need to go
to the hospital, you guys! Please!

01:12:05.037 --> 01:12:06.839
- Come on in.
- Please!

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.878
This is my cousin Herman
and I'm Winston.

01:12:11.879 --> 01:12:14.044
Thank you. Winston, can we just
please get out of here?

01:12:14.045 --> 01:12:16.015
- Please? Please?
- Fuckin' A!

01:12:16.047 --> 01:12:17.617
Hit it, Herman.

01:12:22.499 --> 01:12:28.499
Subtitles: Arigon

01:13:06.168 --> 01:13:08.069
Break a leg, whore.

01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:09.870
Fuck you, troll.

01:13:13.541 --> 01:13:17.014
And don't touch
my stuff, bitch.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.441
That is hot.

01:14:10.233 --> 01:14:13.504
I think that chick goes
to my kid's high school.

01:14:13.535 --> 01:14:16.875
Man, that's fucking hot.

01:14:16.907 --> 01:14:19.177
Yeah, right?

01:14:25.314 --> 01:14:26.367
Yeah.

01:14:27.919 --> 01:14:29.855
Yeah!

01:15:41.826 --> 01:15:44.499
I'd still fuck her.

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:46.300
No doubt.

01:15:56.509 --> 01:15:59.013
Honey, how old are you?

01:15:59.045 --> 01:16:01.583
Old enough.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:06.521
Excuse me.

01:16:06.553 --> 01:16:08.689
You okay?

01:16:08.721 --> 01:16:10.256
Honey, you-

01:16:10.288 --> 01:16:13.762
you just make me so hot.

01:16:22.038 --> 01:16:23.171
What the fuck?

01:16:25.671 --> 01:16:27.408
Fucking bitch.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.811
God.

01:16:38.519 --> 01:16:39.518
Hey.

01:16:40.519 --> 01:16:42.458
The song wasn't over.

01:16:45.493 --> 01:16:47.396
Fucking whores.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.863
Prom blows.
