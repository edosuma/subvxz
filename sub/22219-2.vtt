00:12.513 --> 00:15.248

<b>you'll get a shop.</b>

00:15.249 --> 00:17.383

00:26.894 --> 00:29.529

<b>- This is as far as you go.</b>

00:35.402 --> 00:36.702
<b>- All right, Chris, Hobo.</b>

00:36.703 --> 00:38.104
<b>- CK? It's the end of the line.</b>

00:38.105 --> 00:39.272
<b>- Good luck, assholes.</b>

00:39.273 --> 00:40.806
<b>- Oliver Peck is a [bleep] dick.</b>

00:40.807 --> 00:43.843
<b>- For the judges, this season,</b>
<b>it's personal.</b>

00:43.844 --> 00:45.111
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

00:45.112 --> 00:46.779

<b>there are four spots remaining</b>

00:49.883 --> 00:53.119

00:55.088 --> 00:57.790
<b> <i>the artists fought for</i> </b>

00:57.791 --> 00:59.392

00:59.393 --> 01:01.460
<b>going to destroy my chance.</b>

01:01.461 --> 01:03.262

<b>Teams are full,</b>

01:03.263 --> 01:05.331
<b>and there are no more shops.</b>

01:05.331 --> 01:09.235

01:22.282 --> 01:24.650

02:32.686 --> 02:34.654
<b>It worked out perfectly.</b>

02:34.655 --> 02:37.757

<b> <i>- She's really good.</i> </b>

02:52.172 --> 02:53.906
<b>- But she's only been tattooing</b>
<b>for, like, four years.</b>

02:53.907 --> 02:57.510
<b>- I think SketchyLawyer is</b>
<b>definitely in the top.</b>

02:57.511 --> 02:59.178
<b>- I was a little underwhelmed.</b>

02:59.179 --> 03:00.713

03:00.714 --> 03:01.914

03:41.622 --> 03:45.324
<b>Tattooing has never</b>
<b>been a team sport until now.</b>

03:45.325 --> 03:48.427
<b>But in the end, it will still</b>
<b>only be one artist</b>

03:48.428 --> 03:52.164
<b>who earns $100,000,</b>
<b>a feature in "Ink Magazine,"</b>

03:52.165 --> 03:53.499

03:53.500 --> 03:54.800

<b>- But before you can battle the</b>

03:57.104 --> 03:59.706
<b>you must first battle your own.</b>

04:01.074 --> 04:02.575
<b>- What the [bleep] does that</b>
<b>mean?</b>

04:02.576 --> 04:04.544
<b>- Each week, only one team will</b>
<b>be up for elimination.</b>

04:04.545 --> 04:08.047
<b>You will tattoo against the</b>
<b>artists on your team,</b>

04:08.048 --> 04:10.816

<b>- This week, we're testing</b>
<b>composition.</b>

04:39.847 --> 04:43.683
<b>- Composition is being able to</b>
<b>show how an image</b>

04:43.684 --> 04:46.752
<b>works together as a whole,</b>
<b>how it flows, how it</b>

04:46.753 --> 04:49.622

<b>and making sure that it looks</b>
<b>cohesive as one piece.</b>

04:53.460 --> 04:56.829
<b>- Today, your team must tattoo</b>
<b>three back pieces</b>

04:56.830 --> 05:02.368
<b>on three</b>
<b>canvases at the same time.</b>

05:02.369 --> 05:03.469
<b>- That's [bleep] crazy.</b>

05:03.470 --> 05:04.804
<b> <i>- Three back pieces?</i> </b>

05:04.805 --> 05:08.407
<b>Something</b>
<b>like this usually takes months.</b>

05:08.408 --> 05:11.210
<b>- When placed side-by-side,</b>
<b>all three back pieces</b>

05:11.211 --> 05:15.848
<b>must create</b>
<b>one interlocking image.</b>

05:15.849 --> 05:17.083
<b>- How the [bleep] do we do it?</b>

05:17.084 --> 05:18.585
<b>- Let's bring in your canvases.</b>

05:23.323 --> 05:25.691
<b>Your canvases have been randomly</b>
<b>assigned.</b>

05:25.692 --> 05:27.226
<b>Now, these are guys</b>

05:27.227 --> 05:31.097
<b>on the line every day,</b>
<b>so do not mess them up.</b>

05:31.098 --> 05:33.232
<b>Team Nuñez, your canvases</b>
<b>are some of</b>

05:33.233 --> 05:35.701
<b>the city's bravest firefighters.</b>

05:35.702 --> 05:37.970
<b>Team Peck, your canvases are</b>
<b>some of</b>

05:37.971 --> 05:40.706

05:40.707 --> 05:43.309
<b>The team that wins this flash</b>

<b>have the power to assign the</b>
<b>human canvases</b>

05:50.484 --> 05:53.452
<b>to the opposing team in the</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

05:53.453 --> 05:54.620
<b>- Oh, yeah.</b>

05:54.621 --> 05:57.089
<b>- You will have seven hours to</b>
<b>tattoo.</b>

05:57.090 --> 06:01.027
<b>How you work together is</b>
<b>completely up to you as a team.</b>

06:01.028 --> 06:03.362

06:05.265 --> 06:06.566
<b>- Hi. I'm Nikki.</b>

06:06.567 --> 06:08.467
<b>- For time management,</b>
<b>you need two people</b>

06:08.468 --> 06:09.602
<b>helping shade it.</b>

06:09.603 --> 06:11.470
<b>I'm definitely invested</b>
<b>in my team.</b>

06:11.471 --> 06:13.039
<b>This is the important time</b>

06:13.040 --> 06:14.473
<b>to come together as a team.</b>

06:14.474 --> 06:16.742
<b>With my positive attitude,</b>
<b>we've got the edge.</b>

06:16.743 --> 06:18.177
<b>Team positive.</b>

06:18.178 --> 06:19.679

<b>Team Peck and Team Nuñez,</b>

06:39.800 --> 06:45.071
<b>you have seven hours to tattoo</b>
<b>three interlocking back pieces.</b>

06:45.072 --> 06:47.907

<b>straight. Move forward.</b>

<b> <i>not only do we want to see each</i> </b>
<b> <i>individual piece</i> </b>

07:03.924 --> 07:05.893
<b>overall composition</b>
<b>between the three.</b>

07:10.230 --> 07:11.731

07:11.732 --> 07:13.132
<b> <i>This is a tricky test.</i> </b>

07:13.133 --> 07:15.601
<b>If you work well as a team,</b>

07:19.039 --> 07:21.240
<b> <i>However,</i> </b>
<b> <i>if the team doesn't get along,</i> </b>

07:21.241 --> 07:24.143
<b>then the exposure and the risk</b>
<b>is gonna be very high.</b>

07:24.144 --> 07:25.178

<b>How do you want these</b>

<b>- The light source would be</b>
<b>coming from this side.</b>

<b> <i>- We have to make sure that we</i> </b>
<b> <i>kill these back pieces</i> </b>

09:11.051 --> 09:14.420
<b>- What? What?</b>
<b>So just don't be smooth?</b>

09:14.421 --> 09:17.089
<b>- Because if one comes out</b>
<b>different from the others,</b>

09:17.090 --> 09:20.359
<b>you might be on the chopping</b>
<b>block for it as a team.</b>

09:20.360 --> 09:22.361
<b> <i>- This is why I hate</i> </b>
<b> <i>working in teams.</i> </b>

09:22.362 --> 09:24.297
<b>I cannot dumb myself down</b>

09:24.298 --> 09:26.032
<b>to keep up</b>
<b>with the rest of the team.</b>

09:26.033 --> 09:28.467
<b>- This is a team move, so you</b>
<b>guys all win together.</b>

09:28.468 --> 09:29.535
<b>It's not a solo sport.</b>

09:29.536 --> 09:30.637
<b>- Sure.</b>

09:36.743 --> 09:39.779
<b>- We need our wing shaders in on</b>
<b>that piece, two at a time,</b>

09:39.780 --> 09:40.880
<b>because it's the biggest.</b>

09:40.881 --> 09:42.248
<b>And time is gonna be...</b>

09:42.249 --> 09:45.318
<b>- Gia is really</b>
<b>saving us right now.</b>

09:45.319 --> 09:46.419
<b>- Is that black?</b>
<b>- That's black.</b>

09:46.420 --> 09:48.221
<b>- Okay.</b>

09:48.222 --> 09:49.655
<b>- No one could agree, but now,</b>
<b>it's smooth sailing.</b>

09:49.656 --> 09:52.658
<b>- Bloodline raise.</b>
<b>Dave, did you get that?</b>

09:52.659 --> 09:55.795
<b>- Ryan and Gia... they're both,</b>
<b>like, witchy huntresses.</b>

09:55.796 --> 09:58.464
<b>Like, they see their target,</b>
<b>and they're like...</b>

09:58.465 --> 10:00.066
<b>- Your line waves look</b>
<b>identical.</b>

10:00.067 --> 10:03.069
<b>It looks like the same person</b>
<b>did them.</b>

10:03.070 --> 10:04.304
<b>- Like, no joke.</b> <b>Like...</b>

10:06.807 --> 10:08.941
<b>- Five, four,</b>

10:08.942 --> 10:12.278
<b>three, two, one.</b>

10:12.279 --> 10:15.047
<b>That's it. Machines down.</b>
<b>Time's up.</b>

10:15.048 --> 10:16.383
<b>No more ink.</b>

10:19.019 --> 10:21.220
<b>- Looking at Team Nuñez' design,</b>
<b>it seems like they</b>

10:21.221 --> 10:23.823
<b>took the easy way out by doing</b>
<b>the same image</b>

10:23.824 --> 10:25.358
<b> <i>over and over again.</i> </b>

10:25.359 --> 10:26.926
<b>I mean,</b>
<b>they're doing three horses.</b>

10:26.927 --> 10:28.027
<b>Wow.</b>

10:28.028 --> 10:31.465
<b>- Dude, that looks awesome.</b>

10:34.401 --> 10:36.402
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>Let's get into these critiques.</b>

10:36.403 --> 10:38.538
<b>The team that wins this flash</b>
<b>challenge will</b>

10:38.539 --> 10:41.574
<b>be safe from elimination</b>
<b>this week.</b>

10:41.575 --> 10:43.510
<b>Team Peck, you are up first.</b>

10:46.480 --> 10:48.447
<b> <i>- Guys, your strengths in this</i> </b>
<b> <i>are definitely</i> </b>

10:48.448 --> 10:50.316
<b> <i>how consistent they</i> </b>
<b> <i>look throughout.</i> </b>

10:50.317 --> 10:53.152
<b> <i>The black, the</i> </b>
<b> <i>shading... it's really cohesive.</i> </b>

10:53.153 --> 10:55.721
<b>Obviously, these tattoos can't</b>
<b>fit and touch</b>

10:55.722 --> 10:58.191
<b> <i>and actually interlock, but you</i> </b>
<b> <i>still have elements</i> </b>

10:58.192 --> 11:00.560
<b> <i>that flow from one into</i> </b>
<b> <i>the next.</i> </b>

11:00.561 --> 11:02.128
<b>Pretty impressive.</b>

11:02.129 --> 11:03.729
<b>- It does connect.</b>

11:03.730 --> 11:07.366
<b>The thin, blue line... that is an</b>
<b>extremely thin blue line,</b>

11:07.367 --> 11:10.503
<b>and I think that it's nice,</b>
<b>in terms of it being</b>

11:10.504 --> 11:12.839
<b>something that these guys know</b>
<b>is there, but most of all,</b>

11:12.840 --> 11:16.209
<b>I'm super impressed with just</b>
<b>how cohesive it looks.</b>

11:16.210 --> 11:18.411
<b>- When it comes to composition,</b>
<b>I want to know why</b>

11:18.412 --> 11:21.080
<b> <i>Saint Michael's</i> </b>
<b> <i>head is so far to the left.</i> </b>

11:21.081 --> 11:23.449
<b>- Having one side a little</b>
<b>offset was more</b>

11:23.450 --> 11:26.285
<b> <i>of a joined composition</i> </b>
<b> <i>as a scene in a whole.</i> </b>

11:26.286 --> 11:27.887
<b>That was what we were going for.</b>

11:27.888 --> 11:29.589
<b> <i>- There's so much filler</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the right.</i> </b>

11:29.590 --> 11:31.624
<b> <i>If that was just pushed</i> </b>
<b> <i>over and lined up center,</i> </b>

11:31.625 --> 11:35.094
<b>it would've fit</b>
<b>better on the body.</b>

11:35.095 --> 11:36.697
<b>- Team Nuñez, you're up next.</b>

11:39.933 --> 11:41.701
<b> <i>- We came up</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the three horses.</i> </b>

11:41.702 --> 11:45.805
<b>We put each other in our strong</b>
<b>spots with lining, shading.</b>

11:45.806 --> 11:48.107
<b>- That's a [bleep]load of</b>
<b>good quality tattooing,</b>

11:48.108 --> 11:49.342
<b>from line work to shading.</b>

11:49.343 --> 11:50.943
<b> <i>There are</i> </b>
<b> <i>no beat-up areas of skin.</i> </b>

11:50.944 --> 11:52.512
<b>You guys turned out</b>
<b>three of the best</b>

11:52.513 --> 11:55.014
<b>tattoos that I've seen here.</b>

11:55.015 --> 11:58.217
<b> <i>- As far as the composition</i> </b>
<b> <i>goes, it's a little stagnant.</i> </b>

11:58.218 --> 12:00.586
<b> <i>There doesn't seem to be</i> </b>
<b> <i>something that follows</i> </b>

12:00.587 --> 12:02.221
<b> <i>through the entire three pieces</i> </b>

12:02.222 --> 12:03.956
<b>to make them part of a whole.</b>

12:03.957 --> 12:06.192
<b> <i>You have three</i> </b>
<b> <i>profiles of horses,</i> </b>

12:06.193 --> 12:08.294
<b> <i>all facing left.</i> </b>

12:08.295 --> 12:10.463
<b> <i>The one horse that's</i> </b>
<b> <i>reared up the highest...</i> </b>

12:10.464 --> 12:13.466
<b> <i>you have a huge area on his</i> </b>
<b> <i>back that you can't</i> </b>

12:13.467 --> 12:15.835
<b> <i>really tell what's going on.</i> </b>

12:15.836 --> 12:18.070
<b> <i>The shapes and the muscle tone</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the negative</i> </b>

12:18.071 --> 12:20.106
<b> <i>going through it...</i> </b>
<b> <i>it's a lot of area</i> </b>

12:20.107 --> 12:24.911
<b> <i>to tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>without a specific purpose.</i> </b>

12:24.912 --> 12:27.246
<b>- This is gonna be a tough</b>
<b>decision.</b>

12:27.247 --> 12:30.082
<b>Are you gonna be able</b>
<b>to be objective here?</b>

12:30.083 --> 12:32.084
<b>- I think it's [bleep] up when</b>
<b>you come in here</b>

12:32.085 --> 12:33.219
<b>talking all this [bleep].</b>

12:33.220 --> 12:35.087
<b>- I think we nailed the [bleep]</b>
<b>thing.</b>

12:35.088 --> 12:36.857
<b>- This game's about to get real.</b>

12:39.911 --> 12:43.847
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

12:43.848 --> 12:47.284
<b>- Today, we're testing</b>
<b>composition, tag-team tattoos.</b>

12:47.285 --> 12:49.886
<b>Team Peck, Team Nuñez...</b>
<b>it's tricky to be</b>

12:49.887 --> 12:51.188
<b>judging your own work here.</b>

12:51.189 --> 12:52.923
<b>Are you gonna be able</b>
<b>to be objective here</b>

12:52.924 --> 12:54.624
<b>when it comes to your own team?</b>

12:54.625 --> 12:57.127
<b>- When there's mistakes,</b>
<b>it'll be easy to call them out.</b>

12:57.128 --> 12:59.896
<b>- Just so it's clear,</b>
<b>if we get into a scenario</b>

12:59.897 --> 13:03.066
<b>where I am the deciding factor,</b>
<b>I'm gonna simply go</b>

13:03.067 --> 13:04.935
<b>with what the</b>
<b>challenge of the day is.</b>

13:04.936 --> 13:07.170
<b>So if it's composition,</b>
<b>like it is today,</b>

13:07.171 --> 13:08.905
<b>that's what I'm gonna go with.</b>

13:08.906 --> 13:11.007
<b>Having said that,</b>
<b>what are your thoughts?</b>

13:11.008 --> 13:13.543
<b>- Team Nuñez went really big</b>
<b>and really smooth.</b>

13:13.544 --> 13:16.179
<b> <i>My biggest problem with the</i> </b>
<b> <i>horses is that one horse,</i> </b>

13:16.180 --> 13:17.748
<b> <i>it's hard to read.</i> </b>

13:17.749 --> 13:20.384
<b>- I think it was a lot to keep</b>
<b>certain members of the team</b>

13:20.385 --> 13:22.052
<b>from doing their own thing,</b>

13:22.053 --> 13:23.553
<b>and that's where Oliver called</b>
<b>out the dark spot.</b>

13:23.554 --> 13:26.923
<b>But the quality of the tattooing</b>
<b>is really, really strong.</b>

13:26.924 --> 13:28.425
<b>- As impressive as it is,</b>
<b>there's not</b>

13:28.426 --> 13:29.593
<b>a whole lot of elements.</b>

13:29.594 --> 13:31.194
<b>- It flows, though.</b>

13:31.195 --> 13:33.630
<b>The composition on Team Peck's</b>
<b>side didn't really</b>

13:33.631 --> 13:35.565
<b> <i>do much for me,</i> </b>
<b> <i>because it was a few stripes</i> </b>

13:35.566 --> 13:37.067
<b> <i>cutting over from a center</i> </b>
<b> <i>piece,</i> </b>

13:37.068 --> 13:38.368
<b>and I don't care what</b>
<b>anybody says.</b>

13:38.369 --> 13:40.037
<b>That center piece is so off.</b>

13:40.038 --> 13:42.439
<b>- And they went the asymmetrical</b>
<b>so it wouldn't just be simple.</b>

13:42.440 --> 13:44.641
<b>- But it's only asymmetrical by</b>
<b>that much.</b>

13:44.642 --> 13:45.976
<b>It's just off.</b>

13:45.977 --> 13:47.544
<b>- Are you clear on your</b>
<b>decision?</b>

13:47.545 --> 13:49.546
<b>- Technical outlines?</b>
<b>I think they're both solid.</b>

13:49.547 --> 13:51.748
<b> <i>All six tattoos are clean.</i> </b>

13:51.749 --> 13:53.617
<b> <i>If I get down</i> </b>
<b> <i>to just composition,</i> </b>

13:53.618 --> 13:55.919
<b> <i>I feel like the horse</i> </b>
<b> <i>composition is stale to me.</i> </b>

13:55.920 --> 13:57.921
<b>It's just boom, boom, boom.</b>

13:57.922 --> 13:59.923
<b>- Chris, are you decided on</b>
<b>which way you want to go?</b>

13:59.924 --> 14:01.591
<b>- You're a one-man judge today,</b>
<b>buddy.</b>

14:01.592 --> 14:03.828
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Let's let them know.</b>

14:06.964 --> 14:09.666
<b>Today, you had to tattoo as a</b>
<b>team to create</b>

14:09.667 --> 14:12.369
<b>three interlocking back pieces.</b>

14:12.370 --> 14:14.938
<b>The team that loses this flash</b>
<b>challenge will be</b>

14:14.939 --> 14:18.208
<b>the first team</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

14:18.209 --> 14:21.378
<b>The judges have decided</b>
<b>that the winner</b>

14:21.379 --> 14:24.781
<b>of the flash challenge</b>
<b>is Team Peck.</b>

14:24.782 --> 14:26.750
<b>- Yes!</b>

14:26.751 --> 14:29.820
<b>- Hell, yes. The ball's in our</b>
<b>court, and that rules.</b>

14:29.821 --> 14:31.588
<b>- Two to one, baby. Two to one.</b>

14:31.589 --> 14:35.559
<b>- Call the bull[bleep], man.</b>
<b>One person didn't even tattoo.</b>

14:35.560 --> 14:39.463
<b>- We, as a group, made all of</b>
<b>these decisions together.</b>

14:39.464 --> 14:41.198
<b>- How each individual team</b>
<b>operates</b>

14:41.199 --> 14:43.333
<b>is among the team and</b>
<b>their leader.</b>

14:43.334 --> 14:45.235
<b>Today's challenge</b>
<b>was composition.</b>

14:45.236 --> 14:48.105
<b>There were more elements that</b>
<b>interworked with each other.</b>

14:48.106 --> 14:50.941
<b> <i>The thin blue line,</i> </b>
<b> <i>as hard as it was to see,</i> </b>

14:50.942 --> 14:53.710
<b> <i>was a conscious effort to</i> </b>
<b> <i>create another element</i> </b>

14:53.711 --> 14:57.014
<b> <i>that went across</i> </b>
<b> <i>all three backs.</i> </b>

14:57.015 --> 14:58.515
<b>- It's the first challenge.</b>

14:58.516 --> 15:00.517
<b>If you get knocked off the top</b>
<b>quick, you get back on.</b>

15:00.518 --> 15:02.185
<b>Well, you just</b>
<b>did three horses to ride.</b>

15:02.186 --> 15:04.621
<b>Get back on them.</b>

15:04.622 --> 15:08.025
<b>- Team Peck, you are safe from</b>
<b>elimination this week,</b>

15:08.026 --> 15:10.460
<b>and you will also have the power</b>
<b>to assign</b>

15:10.461 --> 15:12.929
<b>the human canvases to</b>
<b>Team Nuñez.</b>

15:12.930 --> 15:14.264
<b>Head back to the loft,</b>

15:14.265 --> 15:16.933
<b>and prepare for the first</b>
<b>elimination tattoo.</b>

15:16.934 --> 15:19.603
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

15:19.604 --> 15:20.938
<b>- Whoo!</b>

15:23.841 --> 15:25.976
<b>- Hey, look. Straight-up,</b>
<b>everybody on the other team</b>

15:25.977 --> 15:28.612
<b>looked at our tattoo, and y'all</b>
<b>know we did that [bleep].</b>

15:28.613 --> 15:30.213
<b>Y'all were scared as [bleep].</b>

15:30.214 --> 15:32.949
<b>- We answered the assignment</b>
<b>more efficiently than yours did.</b>

15:32.950 --> 15:34.751
<b>- When I hear,</b>
<b>"Shoulder to shoulder,"</b>

15:34.752 --> 15:36.119
<b>bro, I think shoulder...</b>

15:36.120 --> 15:37.354
<b>- But no one said shoulder to</b>
<b>shoulder.</b>

15:37.355 --> 15:39.022
<b>They said it had to</b>
<b>span three backs.</b>

15:39.023 --> 15:41.892
<b>- Ours didn't? I don't know how</b>
<b>the [bleep] we lost.</b>

15:41.893 --> 15:43.627
<b>- I think it's [bleep] up when</b>
<b>you come in here</b>

15:43.628 --> 15:45.629
<b>talking all this [bleep], and</b>
<b>you're upset</b>

15:45.630 --> 15:46.697
<b>about what the judges picked.</b>

15:46.698 --> 15:48.365
<b>Don't take it out on us.</b>

15:48.366 --> 15:50.033
<b>- Do you think y'all's tattoo</b>
<b>was better than ours?</b>

15:50.034 --> 15:51.902
<b>Was our tattoo</b>
<b>better than y'all's?</b>

15:51.903 --> 15:54.771
<b>- The correct question would be,</b>
<b>"Was our tattoo more"...</b>

15:54.772 --> 15:56.139
<b>- Oh, my God. Stop.</b>

15:56.140 --> 15:57.607
<b>- I think we nailed</b>
<b>the [bleep] thing.</b>

15:57.608 --> 15:59.443
<b>- It doesn't [bleep] matter.</b>

15:59.444 --> 16:01.579
<b>So they win. Move on.</b> <b>That's it.</b>

<b>Team Peck, you won the</b>
<b>flash challenge</b>

16:22.967 --> 16:24.935

16:24.936 --> 16:26.503

16:26.504 --> 16:29.806
<b>- What you don't know is that</b>
<b>you also have the power...</b>

16:29.807 --> 16:32.642
<b>each week, the team that is safe</b>
<b>from elimination</b>

16:32.643 --> 16:35.645
<b>will form a jury of peers.</b>

16:35.646 --> 16:38.315
<b>You will observe the</b>
<b>other team's work,</b>

16:38.316 --> 16:41.885
<b>and as a group, deliberate and</b>
<b>choose one artist</b>

16:41.886 --> 16:43.687
<b>to put up for elimination.</b>

16:43.688 --> 16:45.255
<b>- Holy [bleep].</b>

16:45.256 --> 16:47.024
<b>I love having power.</b>

16:47.025 --> 16:49.893
<b>This game's about to get real.</b>

16:49.894 --> 16:51.895
<b>- We're hoping that you, as</b>
<b>tattoo artists,</b>

16:51.896 --> 16:53.230
<b>take this as serious.</b>

16:53.231 --> 16:54.965
<b>We don't want to see you just</b>

16:56.901 --> 16:58.668
<b>We don't want to see you kick</b>
<b>out greater tattooers</b>

16:58.669 --> 17:00.670
<b>to give your</b>
<b>own self a better chance.</b>

17:00.671 --> 17:02.706
<b>We want to see honest,</b>
<b>constructive</b>

17:02.707 --> 17:05.909
<b>critiques on these tattoos.</b>

17:05.910 --> 17:09.512
<b>- Team Nuñez, are you ready for</b>
<b>your first elimination tattoo?</b>

17:09.513 --> 17:10.781
<b>- Hell, yeah.</b>

17:10.781 --> 17:14.551
<b>- Today, you must tattoo Medusa.</b>

17:17.320 --> 17:21.425
<b>From Greek mythology, Medusa is</b>
<b>a monster with snakes for hair,</b>

17:21.425 --> 17:25.595
<b>who turns any man that dares</b>
<b>look at her into stone.</b>

17:25.596 --> 17:29.232
<b>Composition is crucial to</b>
<b>legibility.</b>

17:29.233 --> 17:31.768
<b>- There's a lot of</b>
<b>really tiny detail</b>

17:31.769 --> 17:33.270
<b>when it comes to a Medusa.</b>

17:33.271 --> 17:35.839
<b> <i>You have snakes in her hair,</i> </b>
<b> <i>a pretty face...</i> </b>

17:35.840 --> 17:38.775
<b>they are</b>
<b>really easy to screw up.</b>

17:38.776 --> 17:40.243
<b>- Guys, we took a bad beat</b>
<b>yesterday,</b>

17:40.244 --> 17:42.879
<b>and today, unfortunately, we're</b>
<b>gonna take one more,</b>

17:42.880 --> 17:44.548
<b>because we're gonna</b>
<b>lose somebody.</b>

17:44.549 --> 17:47.250
<b>Keep yourself</b>
<b>here with good features</b>

17:47.251 --> 17:49.353
<b>and a face, a strong snake.</b>

17:49.354 --> 17:54.257
<b>Do not create an eel or</b>
<b>something that leaves them</b>

17:54.258 --> 17:56.626
<b>debating if they're even snakes.</b>

17:56.627 --> 17:59.463
<b>Do not [bleep] that part up.</b>

17:59.464 --> 18:01.132
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

18:07.905 --> 18:10.240
<b>Team Peck, you won the flash</b>
<b>challenge.</b>

18:10.241 --> 18:14.678
<b>You now have the power to assign</b>
<b>the canvases as a team.</b>

18:14.679 --> 18:18.448
<b>Pick one person to talk to the</b>
<b>canvases on behalf of the team.</b>

18:18.449 --> 18:20.217
<b>- We gotta send Dave.</b>

18:20.218 --> 18:21.918
<b>- I think we're gonna send Dave.</b>
<b>- Dave.</b>

18:21.919 --> 18:23.920
<b>- Go ahead, Dave.</b>

18:23.921 --> 18:25.355
<b>- Now, what were you thinking</b>
<b>about getting?</b>

18:25.356 --> 18:28.826
<b>- A full-body Medusa, topless,</b>
<b>and a diamondback snakeskin.</b>

18:33.931 --> 18:36.566
<b>- I don't want anything to do</b>
<b>with a full-body Medusa.</b>

18:36.567 --> 18:37.934
<b>That means</b>
<b>the head's gonna be tiny.</b>

18:37.935 --> 18:39.469
<b>The snakes are gonna be tiny.</b>

18:39.470 --> 18:42.506
<b>That's a technical tattoo with</b>
<b>zero room for error.</b>

18:42.507 --> 18:45.108
<b>- I want a sexy,</b>
<b>realistic Medusa</b>

18:45.109 --> 18:47.477
<b>with a gothic style on my back.</b>

18:47.478 --> 18:49.613
<b>- I want a color-realism</b>
<b>Medusa bust</b>

18:49.614 --> 18:52.015
<b>with dragon-like snake hair.</b>

18:52.016 --> 18:55.686
<b>- Realistic color Medusa is</b>
<b>gonna take a lot of time.</b>

18:55.687 --> 18:58.922
<b>I really hope I'm not getting</b>
<b>this canvas.</b>

18:58.923 --> 19:00.357
<b>- What would you like to get</b>
<b>tattooed?</b>

19:00.358 --> 19:02.278
<b>- Trash Polka-style Medusa head</b>
<b>with some script.</b>

19:03.761 --> 19:06.163
<b>I am pissed my</b>
<b>team lost this first</b>

19:06.164 --> 19:08.632
<b>flash challenge, because now,</b>
<b>Team Peck is gonna</b>

19:08.633 --> 19:10.300
<b> <i>use this skull</i> </b>
<b> <i>pick to their advantage.</i> </b>

19:10.301 --> 19:12.669
<b>We're all going to be screwed.</b>

19:12.670 --> 19:14.971
<b>- Okay. So let's assign per</b>
<b>person.</b>

19:14.972 --> 19:17.040
<b>Trash Polka-style...</b>
<b>pretty easy to pull off.</b>

19:17.041 --> 19:20.577
<b>- The kicker to me is that</b>
<b>full-body Medusa,</b>

19:20.578 --> 19:23.914
<b>because, dude, getting tiny,</b>
<b>tiny, little snakes</b>

19:23.915 --> 19:27.352
<b>to look like snakes in that hair</b>
<b>is gonna be [bleep] ridiculous.</b>

19:28.986 --> 19:30.154
<b>- Okay. We got it.</b>

19:35.026 --> 19:37.794
<b> <i>Our first strategy is to hit</i> </b>
<b> <i>Team Nuñez's top players.</i> </b>

19:37.795 --> 19:40.764
<b>We want to take out the biggest</b>
<b>competitors on that team.</b>

19:40.765 --> 19:43.400
<b>Our second strategy is to</b>
<b>keep weak players in the game,</b>

19:43.401 --> 19:45.068
<b>because ultimately,</b>
<b>these are the people</b>

19:45.069 --> 19:46.270
<b>we're tattooing against.</b>

19:50.908 --> 19:54.044
<b>- Canvases, one by one, please,</b>
<b>read the artist's name</b>

19:54.045 --> 19:55.879
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

19:55.880 --> 19:57.180
<b>- Kevin.</b>

19:57.181 --> 19:59.082
<b>- SketchyLawyer.</b>

19:59.083 --> 20:00.084
<b>- John.</b>

20:04.689 --> 20:06.590
<b>- Tuff Tito.</b>

20:06.591 --> 20:08.191
<b> <i>- Team Peck is out to get me.</i> </b>

20:08.192 --> 20:11.962
<b>They know I'm a strong player,</b>
<b>so they shoot for me first.</b>

20:11.963 --> 20:13.563
<b>- Kelly.</b>

20:13.564 --> 20:15.399
<b>- Carolyn.</b>

20:15.400 --> 20:16.534
<b>- Sirvone.</b>

20:20.538 --> 20:21.538
<b>- Eric.</b>

20:26.778 --> 20:29.346
<b>- Nikki.</b>

20:29.347 --> 20:32.315
<b>- Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>you will have six hours</b>

20:32.316 --> 20:36.553
<b>to show flawless</b>
<b>composition by tattooing Medusa.</b>

20:36.554 --> 20:39.556
<b>Based on your work, one of you</b>
<b>will be</b>

20:39.557 --> 20:42.726
<b>the first artist to close shop.</b>

20:42.727 --> 20:43.995
<b>Good luck.</b>

20:46.030 --> 20:49.232
<b>- Medusas are the Achilles' heel</b>
<b>for all tattooers.</b>

20:49.233 --> 20:51.168
<b> <i>It takes a pretty lady's face.</i> </b>

20:51.169 --> 20:52.402
<b>It takes perfect snakes.</b>

20:52.403 --> 20:53.904
<b>It takes perfect composition.</b>

20:53.905 --> 20:55.972
<b>- You want to do, like, a bust,</b>
<b>so you can get more detail</b>

20:55.973 --> 20:57.641
<b>in, like,</b>
<b>the snakes and the head?</b>

20:57.642 --> 20:59.276
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- Okay. Perfect.</b>

20:59.277 --> 21:01.111
<b>- Full-body Medusa.</b>
<b>- Full-body.</b>

21:01.112 --> 21:02.112
<b>- With a skull face.</b>

21:02.113 --> 21:03.547
<b>- Skull face.</b>

21:03.548 --> 21:05.582
<b>- Looking down at a victim she's</b>
<b>turned to stone.</b>

21:05.583 --> 21:07.150
<b>- Jesus, God.</b>

21:07.151 --> 21:09.219
<b>- This is a pressure cooker,</b>
<b>in my opinion.</b>

21:09.220 --> 21:10.387
<b>- Are you set on color?</b>

21:10.388 --> 21:12.122
<b>- I'm pretty set on color.</b>

21:12.123 --> 21:14.458
<b> <i>- Team Peck is definitely</i> </b>
<b> <i>trying to screw me over</i> </b>

21:14.459 --> 21:16.793
<b>with this</b>
<b>realistic-color Medusa.</b>

21:16.794 --> 21:18.962
<b>I highly recommend black ink,</b>
<b>dude, because, you know,</b>

21:18.963 --> 21:22.199
<b>10, 20 years from now,</b>
<b>it's still gonna look good.</b>

21:22.200 --> 21:24.034
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>I could do black and gray.</b>

21:24.035 --> 21:25.569
<b>- Cool.</b>

21:25.570 --> 21:27.204
<b> <i>If Team Peck thinks</i> </b>
<b> <i>they're gonna take me out,</i> </b>

21:27.205 --> 21:28.405
<b>they got another thing coming.</b>

21:28.406 --> 21:31.375
<b>This is gonna look awesome.</b>

21:31.376 --> 21:32.676
<b>- You want a full-body.</b>

21:32.677 --> 21:35.278
<b>- Full-body Medusa.</b>
<b>She's gonna be topless.</b>

21:35.279 --> 21:36.513
<b> <i>- I can definitely do a Medusa.</i> </b>

21:36.514 --> 21:38.849
<b>But my canvas... he wants a</b>
<b>full-body.</b>

21:38.850 --> 21:39.950
<b>Colorful, right?</b>

21:39.951 --> 21:41.351
<b>- Yeah, yeah.</b>

21:41.352 --> 21:43.192
<b>- And also, he wants color.</b>
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

21:45.156 --> 21:47.257
<b>- Feeling pretty set</b>
<b>on the full-body.</b>

21:47.258 --> 21:48.725
<b>- Something like that?</b>

21:48.726 --> 21:50.561
<b>- Yeah, but we're not doing</b>
<b>just the head.</b>

21:54.499 --> 21:58.535
<b>It's the first elimination,</b>
<b>and my canvas is freaking rigid.</b>

21:58.536 --> 22:00.104
<b>- No.</b>
<b>I'm not a fan of that face.</b>

22:02.707 --> 22:03.947
<b>- I could be screwed right now.</b>

22:06.894 --> 22:09.463
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

22:12.065 --> 22:14.434
<b>- This canvas</b>
<b>is freaking me out.</b>

22:14.435 --> 22:17.036
<b>He wants full-body, and also,</b>
<b>he wants color.</b>

22:17.037 --> 22:20.039
<b>Some real freaking</b>
<b>predator, metallic look.</b>

22:20.040 --> 22:22.508
<b>He could send me home.</b>

22:22.509 --> 22:23.976
<b>- You'll kill yourself</b>
<b>doing all that,</b>

22:23.977 --> 22:25.745
<b>and it's not even that</b>
<b>appealing.</b>

22:25.746 --> 22:27.214
<b>Get rid of that weird rattle.</b>

22:28.282 --> 22:31.117
<b>- He wants a rattle?</b>

22:31.118 --> 22:33.319
<b>- [bleep], Tito.</b>
<b>That thing's just little, man.</b>

22:33.320 --> 22:34.520
<b>- It's a pain in the ass.</b>

22:34.521 --> 22:35.888
<b>- Well,</b>
<b>look at what you're up against.</b>

22:35.889 --> 22:37.290
<b>You're up against a bunch of</b>
<b>people that are doing</b>

22:37.291 --> 22:39.725
<b>big, open faces with big,</b>
<b>beautiful details.</b>

22:39.726 --> 22:41.661
<b>That [bleep]</b>
<b>could either make you the man,</b>

22:41.662 --> 22:43.029
<b>or it could send you home.</b>

22:43.030 --> 22:44.264
<b>It's a tough design.</b>

22:45.365 --> 22:47.301
<b>Don't stress. Hang in.</b>

22:50.838 --> 22:53.206
<b>- All right. Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>you have six hours</b>

22:53.207 --> 22:56.642
<b>to tattoo Medusa and</b>
<b>show great composition.</b>

22:56.643 --> 23:00.613
<b>This is your first chance to</b>
<b>show Chris you have</b>

23:00.614 --> 23:02.448
<b>what it takes to hold your own,</b>

23:02.449 --> 23:07.186
<b>and your time starts now.</b>

23:07.187 --> 23:08.654
<b>- Let's go tattoo.</b>
<b>- Whoo!</b>

23:08.655 --> 23:11.257
<b> <i>- Today, we're testing</i> </b>
<b> <i>composition with Medusas.</i> </b>

23:11.258 --> 23:13.092
<b> <i>This is a tattoo</i> </b>
<b> <i>that needs to be hand drawn</i> </b>

23:13.093 --> 23:15.428
<b>to find that flow,</b>
<b>to find that rhythm.</b>

23:15.429 --> 23:17.997
<b>- I'm just gonna place it where</b>
<b>I think it looks good. Okay?</b>

23:17.998 --> 23:19.999
<b>- I may have to sketch a little</b>
<b>bit of this on.</b>

23:20.000 --> 23:22.235
<b> <i>- If you just cut and paste a</i> </b>
<b> <i>bunch of snakes</i> </b>

23:22.236 --> 23:25.371
<b>to a pretty lady face,</b>
<b>you're gonna have problems.</b>

23:25.372 --> 23:26.373
<b>- Here we go.</b>

23:30.010 --> 23:32.245
<b>- I'm really happy with her</b>
<b>head size.</b>

23:32.246 --> 23:35.248
<b>I've tattooed so many Medusas.</b>

23:35.249 --> 23:38.417
<b>All right. Here we go.</b>
<b>There's a catch.</b>

23:38.418 --> 23:41.320
<b> <i>They take for [bleep] ever,</i> </b>
<b> <i>because there's so</i> </b>

23:41.321 --> 23:44.023
<b>much detail when it comes to</b>
<b>doing all of</b>

23:44.024 --> 23:46.159
<b>those writhing snakes.</b>

23:46.160 --> 23:49.796
<b>I feel like I've got a</b>
<b>leg up in this challenge.</b>

23:49.797 --> 23:51.898
<b> <i>- We all wanted the stronger</i> </b>
<b> <i>artists on our team.</i> </b>

23:51.899 --> 23:54.500
<b>We may have [bleep] ourselves,</b>
<b>because now,</b>

23:54.501 --> 23:56.870
<b>my teammates are my main</b>
<b>opponents.</b>

24:00.707 --> 24:02.875
<b>We have nine people on our team,</b>
<b>who are the strongest</b>

24:02.876 --> 24:05.244
<b> <i>in the room, and so if</i> </b>
<b> <i>you knock out four of those,</i> </b>

24:05.245 --> 24:07.180
<b> <i>when the last five</i> </b>
<b> <i>are still here,</i> </b>

24:07.181 --> 24:09.716
<b>we're gonna have the</b>
<b>strongest team, period.</b>

24:15.088 --> 24:17.023
<b>- I'ma have you sit back and</b>
<b>enjoy the ride.</b>

24:17.024 --> 24:19.559
<b> <i>Team Peck gave me the Trash</i> </b>
<b> <i>Polka tattoo.</i> </b>

24:19.560 --> 24:23.629
<b>I've done this before,</b>
<b>but never with a Medusa.</b>

24:23.630 --> 24:26.332
<b>- This is facing backwards, bro.</b>

24:26.333 --> 24:27.867
<b>It's got to be facing forward.</b>

24:27.868 --> 24:30.336
<b>I'm helping Sirvone, because I</b>
<b>know he's one</b>

24:30.337 --> 24:32.038
<b>of the weakest</b>
<b>artists in Team Nuñez.</b>

24:32.039 --> 24:33.573
<b>Just flip that [bleep] around.</b>

24:33.574 --> 24:37.009
<b>The longer I keep him here,</b>
<b>the better it is for Team Peck.</b>

24:37.010 --> 24:40.213

<b>I'm trying to play the game.</b>

24:40.214 --> 24:44.517
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

24:44.518 --> 24:46.285
<b>- One thing I'm confused about</b>
<b>is why so many</b>

24:46.286 --> 24:47.787
<b>Medusas have hair.</b>

24:47.788 --> 24:51.424
<b>- I think it's either</b>
<b>hair or snakes.</b>

24:51.425 --> 24:53.359
<b>- Maybe they were worried about</b>
<b>doing too many snakes.</b>

24:53.360 --> 24:54.927
<b>Too much going on.</b>

24:54.928 --> 24:56.829
<b>- Damn.</b>

24:56.830 --> 24:59.699
<b>- The snakes are about done, if</b>
<b>that's any consolation.</b>

24:59.700 --> 25:00.767
<b>- Oh, that's it?</b>

25:00.768 --> 25:02.702
<b>- No. I got to do the face.</b>

25:02.703 --> 25:05.171
<b>I know how to do faces better</b>
<b>than most</b>

25:05.172 --> 25:06.539
<b>of the people in this room.</b>

25:06.540 --> 25:08.040
<b>- I've had enough.</b>
<b>I'm taking a break.</b>

25:08.041 --> 25:10.810
<b>I need to go to the bathroom.</b>
<b>I want to get some soda.</b>

25:10.811 --> 25:12.245
<b>- You need to do that right now?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

25:12.246 --> 25:13.813
<b> <i>- We only have six hours.</i> </b>

25:20.988 --> 25:22.622
<b>She's freaking me out.</b>

<b>Four more hours.</b>

<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

<b>If I don't finish,</b>

25:54.121 --> 25:55.721
<b>That's for damn sure.</b>

25:55.722 --> 25:59.926

25:59.927 --> 26:02.028
<b> <i>Get it together, lady.</i> </b>

26:02.029 --> 26:04.397

<b>composition,</b>

26:04.398 --> 26:06.299
<b>nobody is working</b>
<b>with the snakes, like,</b>

26:06.300 --> 26:08.401
<b>pulling them off of the tattoo</b>
<b>and having them</b>

26:08.402 --> 26:09.435
<b>elongate the tattoos.</b>

26:09.436 --> 26:12.672
<b>A lot of them are like stickers.</b>

26:14.475 --> 26:17.978
<b>I'm used to taking my time.</b>

26:27.855 --> 26:29.589
<b>I almost didn't even make</b>
<b>it onto a team.</b>

26:29.590 --> 26:31.124
<b>I was the last pick.</b>

26:31.125 --> 26:33.392
<b> <i>At this point, I need to</i> </b>
<b> <i>not feel like the underdog.</i> </b>

26:33.393 --> 26:36.996
<b>I put a lot of things on</b>
<b>hold... my whole life, my kids.</b>

26:36.997 --> 26:39.999
<b> <i>I need to nail this down.</i> </b>

26:40.000 --> 26:41.701
<b>- Tito looks rough.</b>

26:41.702 --> 26:44.437
<b>- Rough. I think what we went</b>
<b>after happened.</b>

26:44.438 --> 26:45.905
<b>- Yeah. Inadvertently, yeah.</b>

26:45.906 --> 26:47.507
<b>- True, but not maybe the way we</b>
<b>were expecting it to.</b>

26:47.508 --> 26:49.008
<b>But it's looking kind of...</b>

26:49.009 --> 26:50.209
<b>- It looks like Tito's got the</b>
<b>worst.</b>

26:50.210 --> 26:51.377
<b>- Think we're getting good luck.</b>

26:51.378 --> 26:52.412
<b>- I think so too.</b>

26:55.282 --> 26:58.651
<b>- Seven, six, five,</b>

26:58.652 --> 27:02.688
<b>four, three, two, one.</b>

27:02.689 --> 27:04.023
<b>That's it. Time's up.</b>

27:04.024 --> 27:06.993
<b>Machines down. No more ink.</b>

27:06.994 --> 27:08.628
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Done.</b>

27:08.629 --> 27:10.763
<b>- We're done.</b>

27:10.764 --> 27:12.565
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Do you want to take a look?</b>

27:12.566 --> 27:16.502
<b>- I do.</b>

27:16.503 --> 27:18.471
<b>- We started out a little rough,</b>
<b>but we got it done.</b>

27:18.472 --> 27:21.674
<b>- Tuff Tito's Medusa... his snakes</b>
<b>look like yarn.</b>

27:21.675 --> 27:24.243
<b> <i>It looks like a</i> </b>
<b> <i>zombified Raggedy Ann.</i> </b>

27:24.244 --> 27:26.146
<b>It's [bleep], and he needs to go</b>
<b>home with it.</b>

27:28.816 --> 27:30.049
<b>You are a target, man.</b>

27:30.050 --> 27:32.652
<b>- If they shoot for me, they</b>
<b>better aim right.</b>

27:32.653 --> 27:35.555
<b>- Do you think Carolyn's face is</b>
<b>worse than Tito's?</b>

27:35.556 --> 27:37.123
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Come on.</b>

27:37.124 --> 27:39.044
<b>- I can't even believe</b>
<b>we're not going over this.</b>

27:40.978 --> 27:44.581
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

27:46.250 --> 27:49.118
<b>- I think the jury of peers is</b>
<b>gonna pick Tito.</b>

27:49.119 --> 27:51.053
<b>- I knew that from day one</b>
<b>they'd shoot for me.</b>

27:51.054 --> 27:54.056
<b>- His tattoo did not stand up</b>
<b>against a couple others,</b>

27:54.057 --> 27:57.960
<b>and they know he's strong,</b>
<b>so it's a win-win if he's gone.</b>

27:57.961 --> 27:59.829
<b>- You are a target, man.</b>

27:59.830 --> 28:01.430
<b>- If they want to play the game</b>
<b>correctly,</b>

28:01.431 --> 28:04.166
<b>they will pick the best players</b>
<b>on the [bleep] team.</b>

28:04.167 --> 28:07.169
<b>- If they shoot for me, they</b>
<b>better aim right.</b>

28:07.170 --> 28:09.940
<b>'Cause if they miss</b>
<b>it, I'm coming hard.</b>

28:23.020 --> 28:27.990
<b>- Today, you had to show perfect</b>
<b>composition in tattooing Medusa.</b>

28:27.991 --> 28:31.427
<b>Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>let's see how you did.</b>

28:31.428 --> 28:34.230
<b>Tito.</b>

28:34.231 --> 28:37.133
<b>- The snake heads are all</b>
<b>completely so different.</b>

28:37.134 --> 28:38.534
<b>Some of them look like koi.</b>

28:38.535 --> 28:40.269
<b>Some of them have a frog look.</b>

28:40.270 --> 28:42.572
<b>- I just tried to create the</b>
<b>best composition that I could.</b>

28:42.573 --> 28:45.908
<b> <i>- Her arm just ending abruptly</i> </b>
<b> <i>like that is really strange.</i> </b>

28:45.909 --> 28:48.811
<b> <i>The bottom of the tattoo,</i> </b>
<b> <i>where her torso ends off,</i> </b>

28:48.812 --> 28:50.279
<b> <i>also strange.</i> </b>

28:50.280 --> 28:52.081
<b>And then, there's a little piece</b>
<b>of something on her hip,</b>

28:52.082 --> 28:54.083
<b> <i>and I don't know if that's a</i> </b>
<b> <i>piece of her clothing.</i> </b>

28:54.084 --> 28:57.087
<b>This is a really, really rough</b>
<b>tattoo to turn in today.</b>

28:59.122 --> 29:00.523
<b>- Eric.</b>

29:00.524 --> 29:02.191
<b>- This tattoo is so tonal.</b>

29:02.192 --> 29:03.426
<b>You don't have the rich.</b>

29:03.427 --> 29:04.827
<b>You don't have the smooth.</b>

29:04.828 --> 29:06.829
<b>- I definitely bit off more than</b>
<b>I could chew.</b>

29:06.830 --> 29:08.731
<b>- It doesn't look like a</b>
<b>finished tattoo.</b>

29:08.732 --> 29:11.133
<b>The stripy, heavy, black</b>
<b>lines in the hair,</b>

29:11.134 --> 29:13.402
<b>and then not enough shading to</b>
<b>back them up...</b>

29:13.403 --> 29:15.504
<b>- It's just dealing with this</b>
<b>time issue.</b>

29:15.505 --> 29:19.108
<b>- You looked not in the groove,</b>
<b>and you've got to find it.</b>

29:19.109 --> 29:21.444
<b>- Chris, what's it like</b>
<b>critiquing your own team?</b>

29:21.445 --> 29:23.746
<b>I mean, obviously, you want to</b>
<b>see these guys succeed.</b>

29:23.747 --> 29:26.115
<b>- It's terrible, because now, I</b>
<b>feel what they feel.</b>

29:26.116 --> 29:28.284
<b>Before, they were just people</b>
<b>that we were working</b>

29:28.285 --> 29:29.585
<b>through to get to the best.</b>

29:29.586 --> 29:30.887
<b>But now, it's like, "Damn it.</b>"

29:30.888 --> 29:32.788
<b>"If I spend time with</b>
<b>you, and I become human,</b>

29:32.789 --> 29:35.725
<b>"and we bro down, and then I</b>
<b>have to put the hat back on</b>

29:35.726 --> 29:37.426
<b>and come over here?"</b> <b>It's rough.</b>

29:37.427 --> 29:40.663
<b>This is only</b>
<b>gonna get harder and harder.</b>

29:40.664 --> 29:43.799
<b>- Sirvone.</b>

29:43.800 --> 29:45.234
<b>- Your outline looks nervous.</b>

29:45.235 --> 29:47.069
<b>The wobbly ridge of the nose</b>
<b>sticks out,</b>

29:47.070 --> 29:49.071
<b> <i>so when I look her in the</i> </b>
<b> <i>eyes, boom.</i> </b>

29:49.072 --> 29:50.640
<b> <i>The first thing you</i> </b>
<b> <i>see looking in the eye</i> </b>

29:50.641 --> 29:51.741
<b> <i>is a big wobble.</i> </b>

29:51.742 --> 29:54.877
<b>That is a major problem.</b>

29:54.878 --> 29:56.479
<b>- Kelly.</b>

29:56.480 --> 29:57.813
<b> <i>- The shading's beautiful.</i> </b>

29:57.814 --> 29:59.982
<b> <i>The detail in the eyes,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the ridge of the nose,</i> </b>

29:59.983 --> 30:02.685
<b> <i>the lips... everything</i> </b>
<b> <i>fits beautifully.</i> </b>

30:02.686 --> 30:04.554
<b>- The fact that you were able to</b>
<b>put in this</b>

30:04.555 --> 30:06.756
<b>little figure turning into stone</b>
<b>now created a story.</b>

30:06.757 --> 30:09.759
<b>That's hitting</b>
<b>composition out of the park.</b>

30:09.760 --> 30:11.661
<b>- Thank you.</b>

30:11.662 --> 30:13.729
<b>- John Collins.</b>

30:13.730 --> 30:15.998
<b>- Medusa's supposed to have such</b>
<b>a beautiful face</b>

30:15.999 --> 30:17.900
<b>that no one can</b>
<b>look away from her.</b>

30:17.901 --> 30:19.702
<b> <i>You kind of</i> </b>
<b> <i>went more sea-monster.</i> </b>

30:19.703 --> 30:23.706
<b>Compositionally, the one big</b>
<b>drawing mistake you put in there</b>

30:23.707 --> 30:26.442
<b>is that snake that comes over</b>
<b>and cuts into her chin.</b>

30:26.443 --> 30:29.111
<b>It kind of just deters away from</b>
<b>her face line,</b>

30:29.112 --> 30:30.847
<b> <i>and if that snake's</i> </b>
<b> <i>gonna interact with her,</i> </b>

30:30.848 --> 30:32.381
<b> <i>it needs to be a little bit</i> </b>
<b> <i>more believable.</i> </b>

30:32.382 --> 30:35.419
<b>It's a little stiff.</b>
<b>But overall, a strong tattoo.</b>

30:37.354 --> 30:39.722
<b>- SketchyLawyer.</b>

30:39.723 --> 30:42.158
<b>- Technically, this tattoo's</b>
<b>smooth as ice, man.</b>

30:42.159 --> 30:44.827
<b>Clean lines, smooth shading,</b>
<b>and you're one of the only</b>

30:44.828 --> 30:48.965
<b>people today that made a design</b>
<b>that fit the body well.</b>

30:48.966 --> 30:51.167
<b>- You definitely secure your</b>
<b>position at this moment.</b>

30:51.168 --> 30:54.604
<b>Strong tattoo.</b>

30:54.605 --> 30:56.472
<b>- Kevin.</b>

30:56.473 --> 30:58.641
<b>- You have some really nice</b>
<b>elements in the face.</b>

30:58.642 --> 31:01.077
<b> <i>You did some really nice tricks</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the light and the shadow</i> </b>

31:01.078 --> 31:02.445
<b> <i>coming off of her nose.</i> </b>

31:02.446 --> 31:04.614
<b> <i>But it's two big snakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>and a severed head</i> </b>

31:04.615 --> 31:06.215
<b>floating in a diamond.</b>

31:06.216 --> 31:08.518
<b>- When I think of Medusa,</b>
<b>I think of snakes</b>

31:08.519 --> 31:10.119
<b>growing out of her head.</b>

31:10.120 --> 31:13.122
<b>I don't understand why you would</b>
<b>choose to not show any of that.</b>

31:13.123 --> 31:15.091
<b>- I was trying my hardest to be</b>
<b>able to do full color</b>

31:15.092 --> 31:16.559
<b>and give you a good tattoo.</b>

31:16.560 --> 31:18.361
<b>So if it meant me having</b>
<b>to box some things in,</b>

31:18.362 --> 31:19.862
<b>that's what I did.</b>

31:19.863 --> 31:22.365
<b> <i>- I don't see how anybody is</i> </b>
<b> <i>gonna be impressed</i> </b>

31:22.366 --> 31:26.469
<b>by this ill-placed, sketchy,</b>
<b>[bleep] round [bleep] square</b>

31:26.470 --> 31:27.904
<b>on this guy's chest.</b>

31:27.905 --> 31:30.540
<b> <i>The snake going into the armpit</i> </b>
<b> <i>is jacked.</i> </b>

31:30.541 --> 31:33.343
<b>This is probably the worst</b>
<b>placement of the day.</b>

31:35.579 --> 31:39.215
<b>- Nikki, I love this tattoo.</b>
<b>The face is beautiful.</b>

31:39.216 --> 31:41.250
<b> <i>The composition is really great.</i> </b>

31:41.251 --> 31:42.518
<b> <i>You don't have tons of snakes,</i> </b>

31:42.519 --> 31:44.287
<b> <i>but what you do have</i> </b>
<b> <i>are dynamic.</i> </b>

31:44.288 --> 31:46.122
<b>- The part of the tattoo</b>
<b>that I do not like</b>

31:46.123 --> 31:48.524
<b>is the two pieces of body</b>
<b>directly over</b>

31:48.525 --> 31:49.859
<b> <i>the top of her forehead.</i> </b>

31:49.860 --> 31:52.495
<b>Those look like green bananas,</b>
<b>not snakes.</b>

31:52.496 --> 31:55.431
<b>But you still gave her a</b>
<b>beautiful tattoo.</b>

31:55.432 --> 31:58.301
<b>- Carolyn.</b>

31:58.302 --> 32:01.070
<b>- The back side of the tattoo</b>
<b>looks very unfinished.</b>

32:01.071 --> 32:03.673
<b> <i>She literally just has just a</i> </b>
<b> <i>little bit of a face.</i> </b>

32:03.674 --> 32:06.509
<b> <i>It's floating in this mess</i> </b>
<b> <i>that, from a distance,</i> </b>

32:06.510 --> 32:08.544
<b> <i>is really</i> </b>
<b> <i>hard to tell what's going on.</i> </b>

32:08.545 --> 32:11.214
<b>- I ran out of time,</b>
<b>and I had to focus a little bit</b>

32:11.215 --> 32:13.349
<b>more on the face,</b>
<b>rather than the smoke.</b>

32:13.350 --> 32:15.084
<b> <i>- These outlines and this</i> </b>
<b> <i>shading...</i> </b>

32:15.085 --> 32:17.186
<b> <i>it has a very</i> </b>
<b> <i>single-needle, prison-machine</i> </b>

32:17.187 --> 32:19.522
<b>look to it,</b>
<b>and you have all the tools.</b>

32:19.523 --> 32:21.624
<b>That's not a good thing.</b>
<b>You're on my team.</b>

32:21.625 --> 32:23.426
<b>I want to sugar-coat it as much</b>
<b>as possible,</b>

32:23.427 --> 32:24.927
<b>but it's not possible.</b>

32:24.928 --> 32:26.896
<b>This quality does not stand up.</b>

32:26.897 --> 32:28.098
<b>You're hanging yourself.</b>

32:31.902 --> 32:33.469
<b>- All right, guys.</b>

32:33.470 --> 32:35.371
<b>Time to determine who had the</b>
<b>best tattoo of the day.</b>

32:35.372 --> 32:38.107
<b>- The top two would be either</b>
<b>Nikki or Kelly.</b>

32:38.108 --> 32:40.943
<b>Both of them captured the really</b>
<b>beautiful face.</b>

32:40.944 --> 32:43.312
<b>Nikki got some really</b>
<b>bright, beautiful colors.</b>

32:43.313 --> 32:46.682
<b>Kelly's tattoo... nice and soft</b>
<b>and beautiful.</b>

32:46.683 --> 32:48.050
<b>- I loved Sketchy's application.</b>

32:48.051 --> 32:50.853
<b>The most consistent</b>
<b>all the way through.</b>

32:50.854 --> 32:53.055
<b>I side with the technical.</b>

32:53.056 --> 32:54.524
<b>- I'm gonna go with Kelly.</b>

32:54.525 --> 32:56.759
<b>- Kelly did play with</b>
<b>composition,</b>

32:56.760 --> 32:58.060
<b>where she created a story.</b>

32:58.061 --> 33:01.364
<b>That really matters to me.</b>

33:01.365 --> 33:07.203
<b>My vote</b>
<b>today is going to be for Kelly.</b>

33:07.204 --> 33:09.272
<b>The judges have decided.</b>

33:09.273 --> 33:13.543
<b>The best tattoo of the day goes</b>
<b>to Kelly.</b>

33:13.544 --> 33:15.478
<b>- Thank you very much.</b>

33:15.479 --> 33:17.647
<b>- Team Peck,</b>
<b>as the jury of peers,</b>

33:17.648 --> 33:21.284
<b>you must deliberate and put one</b>
<b>artist up for elimination.</b>

33:21.285 --> 33:25.855
<b>Team Nuñez, one of you is about</b>
<b>to pack your machines.</b>

33:25.856 --> 33:26.990
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>

33:32.262 --> 33:34.897
<b>- I'm pretty sure</b>
<b>I'm going home today.</b>

33:34.898 --> 33:37.166
<b>- Your lack of confidence is</b>
<b>having a lot to do</b>

33:37.167 --> 33:39.735
<b>with you not hitting the mark</b>
<b>when you're tattooing.</b>

33:39.736 --> 33:41.571
<b>If you're gonna stick around,</b>
<b>you got to put</b>

33:41.572 --> 33:42.939
<b>everything outside of your head.</b>

33:42.940 --> 33:44.173
<b>- I know what I can do,</b>
<b>and I know that people do.</b>

33:44.174 --> 33:46.042
<b>- You don't show it though.</b>

33:46.043 --> 33:48.511
<b>- If they call you down there,</b>
<b>you need to reassure them that</b>

33:48.512 --> 33:50.046
<b>you're here to [bleep] kill it.</b>

33:50.047 --> 33:51.848
<b>You already know Tito's gonna go</b>
<b>down there</b>

33:51.849 --> 33:53.482
<b>and be like,</b>
<b>"[bleep] that. I'm..."</b>

33:53.483 --> 33:56.085
<b>- Hey... hey, there's no way in</b>
<b>hell I'm going home.</b>

33:56.086 --> 33:57.920
<b>- I just don't want you to get</b>
<b>eaten alive.</b>

33:57.921 --> 33:59.455
<b>You're not no little weak bitch.</b>

33:59.456 --> 34:02.258
<b>Even if you are,</b>
<b>make sure that people think</b>

34:02.259 --> 34:03.860
<b>that you're some bad bitch.</b>

34:03.861 --> 34:05.928
<b>- There's no [bleep] way that</b>
<b>I'm going home today.</b>

34:05.929 --> 34:07.598
<b>There's no [bleep] way.</b>

34:10.888 --> 34:14.791
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

34:14.792 --> 34:17.092
<b>- We are here</b>
<b>as the jury of peers</b>

34:17.094 --> 34:20.096
<b>to decide who should be</b>
<b>eliminated.</b>

34:20.097 --> 34:22.098
<b>- Tito's is just a bad tattoo</b>
<b>all around.</b>

34:22.099 --> 34:23.766
<b> <i>- Those snakes are horrible.</i> </b>

34:23.766 --> 34:26.969
<b>- I don't think his canvas asked</b>
<b>for eel-faced snakes.</b>

34:26.969 --> 34:29.038
<b>- It's missing an arm, and look</b>
<b>how he ended the belly.</b>

34:29.039 --> 34:30.440
<b>It just ends.</b>

34:30.440 --> 34:33.443
<b>- When I look at it, though,</b>
<b>I see more symmetry</b>

34:33.444 --> 34:35.545
<b>and balance than I</b>
<b>do in Carolyn's.</b>

34:35.545 --> 34:38.514
<b> <i>Kind of see a nose and two</i> </b>
<b> <i>eyes, and then a bunch of mush.</i> </b>

34:38.514 --> 34:39.549
<b> <i>- I vote for Carolyn.</i> </b>

34:39.550 --> 34:41.117
<b>- Look at Tito's.</b>

34:41.118 --> 34:44.053
<b> <i>Do you think Carolyn's snakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>are worse than Tito's?</i> </b>

34:44.054 --> 34:45.521
<b>- No.</b>

34:45.522 --> 34:47.290
<b>- Do you think Carolyn's face is</b>
<b>worse than Tito's?</b>

34:47.291 --> 34:48.558
<b>- No.</b>

34:48.559 --> 34:49.792
<b>- Then what are we even talking</b>
<b>about?</b>

34:49.793 --> 34:51.561
<b>- I disagree.</b>
<b>I think it is worse.</b>

34:51.562 --> 34:53.262
<b>I see more balance</b>
<b>in the other one.</b>

34:53.263 --> 34:54.897
<b>- Come on.</b>

34:54.898 --> 34:57.900
<b>- I can't even believe we're</b>
<b>[bleep] arguing over this.</b>

34:57.901 --> 34:59.335
<b>- All right, guys.</b>

34:59.336 --> 35:01.771
<b>Today, we are testing</b>
<b>composition with Medusa tattoos.</b>

35:01.772 --> 35:03.439
<b>Team Nuñez up for elimination...</b>

35:03.440 --> 35:05.408
<b>who's sitting on</b>
<b>the bottom for you today?</b>

35:05.409 --> 35:07.210
<b>- For me, I think Sirvone.</b>

35:07.211 --> 35:10.646
<b>It's a traditional tattoo with</b>
<b>not a very well composed,</b>

35:10.647 --> 35:12.381
<b>trying-to-be-Trash Polka</b>
<b>background.</b>

35:12.382 --> 35:16.753
<b>- I would wear Sirvone's tattoo</b>
<b>any day over Kevin's tattoo.</b>

35:16.754 --> 35:18.721
<b>It's coming out of the armpit.</b>

35:18.722 --> 35:20.623
<b>- The snake under the main snake</b>
<b>looks like</b>

35:20.624 --> 35:22.291
<b>he's just growing out</b>
<b>of her temple.</b>

35:22.292 --> 35:23.826
<b>Nothing flows in the same</b>
<b>direction</b>

35:23.827 --> 35:25.695
<b>in any way in</b>
<b>this entire tattoo.</b>

35:25.696 --> 35:27.163
<b>- Chris,</b>
<b>you're the team captain here.</b>

35:27.164 --> 35:28.698
<b>Who are your bottoms today?</b>

35:28.699 --> 35:31.734
<b>- Definitely Carolyn, because</b>
<b>Carolyn's just a mess.</b>

35:31.735 --> 35:34.403
<b> <i>- The only real hard,</i> </b>
<b> <i>definitive edges she has</i> </b>

35:34.404 --> 35:37.006
<b>anywhere in this tattoo are the</b>
<b>outline of the eyes.</b>

35:37.007 --> 35:38.808
<b> <i>- Those are two very</i> </b>
<b> <i>different eyes.</i> </b>

35:38.809 --> 35:41.377
<b>- In her defense,</b>
<b>Tito's is just hideous.</b>

35:41.378 --> 35:45.348
<b> <i>That tone in the body...</i> </b>
<b> <i>those colors... it is beat up.</i> </b>

35:45.349 --> 35:47.817
<b>It is not saturated.</b>
<b>It is a weird color choice.</b>

35:47.818 --> 35:50.820
<b>- This is the first time we have</b>
<b>Team Peck jury of peers.</b>

35:50.821 --> 35:53.656
<b>Now, we got nine other tattooers</b>
<b>who are gonna</b>

35:53.657 --> 35:55.091
<b>weigh in on this decision.</b>

35:55.092 --> 35:56.259
<b>They're gonna put</b>
<b>somebody up for elimination,</b>

35:56.260 --> 35:57.326
<b>but I think we're agreed.</b>

35:57.327 --> 35:58.361
<b>You good?</b> <b>- I'm good.</b>

35:58.362 --> 35:59.596
<b>- Time to get them.</b>

36:02.599 --> 36:04.300
<b>- I felt like, as a team,</b>
<b>we kicked ass,</b>

36:04.301 --> 36:06.335
<b>and now, all of a sudden,</b>
<b>we're gonna lose a player.</b>

36:06.336 --> 36:07.504
<b>It's gonna [bleep] suck.</b>

36:15.012 --> 36:16.512
<b>- All right.</b>

36:16.513 --> 36:18.648
<b>Jury of peers, who are you</b>
<b>putting up for elimination?</b>

36:18.649 --> 36:23.519
<b>- Today, the jury of peers</b>
<b>decided to put Tuff Tito</b>

36:23.520 --> 36:25.388
<b>up for elimination.</b>

36:25.389 --> 36:26.622
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>The judges are gonna see</b>

36:26.623 --> 36:31.727
<b>Tito, Carolyn, and Kevin.</b>

36:31.728 --> 36:34.364
<b>We'll see you and the jury of</b>
<b>peers downstairs.</b>

36:38.001 --> 36:40.570
<b>- We debated,</b>
<b>and we really hammered it out,</b>

36:40.571 --> 36:42.538
<b>and at the end,</b>
<b>it wasn't unanimous.</b>

36:42.539 --> 36:44.173
<b>It was a majority rule.</b>

36:44.174 --> 36:47.176
<b>- You guys better pray that I</b>
<b>don't walk back from that door.</b>

36:47.177 --> 36:48.377
<b>That's the only thing</b>
<b>I have to say.</b>

36:48.378 --> 36:49.579
<b>Let's go downstairs.</b>

36:49.580 --> 36:50.781
<b>I'm ready.</b> <b>Let's go.</b>

37:02.493 --> 37:05.061
<b>- Today, you had to tattoo</b>
<b>Medusa.</b>

37:05.062 --> 37:08.164
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will be the first</b>

37:08.165 --> 37:10.867
<b>artist to pack your machines.</b>

37:10.868 --> 37:12.368
<b>Let's hear it</b>
<b>from the jury of peers.</b>

37:12.369 --> 37:15.371
<b>Team Peck, why did you vote Tito</b>
<b>to the bottom?</b>

37:15.372 --> 37:17.106
<b>- When it came down to it,</b>
<b>it was who had</b>

37:17.107 --> 37:20.042
<b>the prettiest face,</b>
<b>who had the best snakes,</b>

37:20.043 --> 37:22.178
<b> <i>who had the</i> </b>
<b> <i>best color packing or shading.</i> </b>

37:22.179 --> 37:24.714
<b>We just really debated on that.</b>

37:24.715 --> 37:26.215
<b>- The majority voted Tito.</b>

37:26.216 --> 37:28.451
<b>- They shoot for me.</b>
<b>I'm a strong competitor.</b>

37:28.452 --> 37:30.119
<b>I don't think I</b>
<b>deserve to go home.</b>

37:30.120 --> 37:31.654
<b>- Tito, I like your confidence,</b>
<b>but...</b>

37:31.655 --> 37:34.390
<b>- The only game I can play at</b>
<b>the time was composition.</b>

37:34.391 --> 37:37.760
<b>- Did he suggest purples</b>
<b>and reds and opaque grays</b>

37:37.761 --> 37:38.895
<b>and just scattered?</b>

37:38.896 --> 37:40.296
<b>- That's what he wanted.</b>

37:40.297 --> 37:41.664
<b>- But aside from the struggles</b>
<b>with the canvas,</b>

37:41.665 --> 37:43.433
<b>the nose is crooked, eyes aren't</b>
<b>the same shape.</b>

37:43.434 --> 37:45.168
<b>The forehead line is off.</b>

37:45.169 --> 37:47.470
<b>This is one of the worst</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

37:47.471 --> 37:49.105
<b>- Kevin.</b>

37:49.106 --> 37:51.340
<b>- As far as composition goes,</b>
<b>I understand why I'm down here.</b>

37:51.341 --> 37:53.543
<b>But do I think I should go home?</b>
<b>No.</b>

37:53.544 --> 37:56.312
<b>- You did a nice face with some</b>
<b>weird [bleep] around it.</b>

37:56.313 --> 37:58.247
<b>The fact that all these elements</b>
<b>are in the same tattoo</b>

37:58.248 --> 37:59.382
<b>is mind boggling to me.</b>

37:59.383 --> 38:01.017
<b>- I promise you, I see that.</b>

38:01.018 --> 38:02.485
<b>- As talented as you are,</b>
<b>and you're in my top five,</b>

38:02.486 --> 38:04.487
<b>to lose you on a day like this,</b>
<b>out of the gate?</b>

38:04.488 --> 38:07.457
<b>I wasted a pick.</b>
<b>Don't make me waste my picks.</b>

38:07.458 --> 38:09.492
<b>- Carolyn, I feel like you're</b>
<b>overconfident.</b>

38:09.493 --> 38:10.827
<b>I think that this tattoo shows...</b>
<b>- No, no, no, no, no.</b>

38:10.828 --> 38:12.595
<b>I don't think I'm overconfident.</b>

38:12.596 --> 38:14.730
<b>Actually, that's the thing, is</b>
<b>that I was holding back a lot.</b>

38:14.731 --> 38:16.766
<b>- From any distance at all,</b>
<b>it's an eyes, a nose,</b>

38:16.767 --> 38:18.768
<b>and a mouth,</b>
<b>and who knows what else?</b>

38:18.769 --> 38:20.103
<b>It's a mess.</b>

38:20.104 --> 38:22.672
<b>- I don't think my tattoo is</b>
<b>worse than his.</b>

38:22.673 --> 38:25.108
<b>There's ways to make</b>
<b>that image look better,</b>

38:25.109 --> 38:28.845
<b>instead of making little yarns</b>
<b>coming out of the head.</b>

38:28.846 --> 38:31.514
<b>- All right, guys. Time to</b>
<b>determine who's going home.</b>

38:31.515 --> 38:35.451
<b>Tito's... I mean, it looks like a</b>
<b>painful injury.</b>

38:35.452 --> 38:37.653
<b>My vote is to send Tito home.</b>

38:37.654 --> 38:42.425
<b>- Tito, your tattoo today, no</b>
<b>doubt, everybody agrees, sucks.</b>

38:42.426 --> 38:45.228
<b>But do I believe you can</b>
<b>go forward? Yes.</b>

38:45.229 --> 38:48.765
<b>We want the best artists to go</b>
<b>forward in this competition.</b>

38:48.766 --> 38:50.099
<b>Now, this is Nuñez' team.</b>

38:50.100 --> 38:52.001
<b>I don't want to attack him</b>
<b>personally</b>

38:52.002 --> 38:53.302
<b>and try to attack his team.</b>

38:53.303 --> 38:55.004
<b>So I'm not gonna let my</b>
<b>critiques beat down</b>

38:55.005 --> 38:57.140
<b>his strong</b>
<b>competitors in any way.</b>

38:57.141 --> 38:59.776
<b>That's not how me and him are</b>
<b>playing this game.</b>

38:59.777 --> 39:04.580
<b>But if I look at the tattoos</b>
<b>that everybody has done so far</b>

39:04.581 --> 39:08.117
<b> <i>and see who has these different</i> </b>
<b> <i>tools that are gonna help them</i> </b>

39:08.118 --> 39:11.020
<b> <i>go the furthest, Carolyn,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I'm sorry.</i> </b>

39:11.021 --> 39:14.056
<b>My vote is for you.</b>

39:14.057 --> 39:15.792
<b>- Here's where I'm at,</b>
<b>and here's how it falls.</b>

39:15.793 --> 39:18.761
<b>Carolyn's report card is the</b>
<b>worst of the three, period.</b>

39:18.762 --> 39:21.464
<b>- I haven't done tattoos like</b>
<b>that since</b>

39:21.465 --> 39:23.132
<b>I [bleep] started tattooing.</b>

39:23.133 --> 39:26.436
<b>I didn't come here, leave my</b>
<b>whole life to stand here,</b>

39:26.437 --> 39:28.438
<b>to go [bleep] home right now.</b>

39:28.439 --> 39:30.506
<b>- The report cards make sense,</b>
<b>because we've only</b>

39:30.507 --> 39:32.041
<b>seen a few tattoos from you.</b>

39:32.042 --> 39:34.243
<b> <i>- Traditional day,</i> </b>
<b> <i>Tito beat you.</i> </b>

39:34.244 --> 39:37.113
<b> <i>Geisha day, Tito beat you.</i> </b>

39:37.114 --> 39:40.716
<b>I'm sure at home, you are much</b>
<b>better than</b>

39:40.717 --> 39:42.218
<b>you are in a pressure cooker,</b>
<b>but...</b>

39:42.219 --> 39:44.454
<b>- I am gonna say, I know you're</b>
<b>about to say my name,</b>

39:44.455 --> 39:46.522
<b>but I think you're gonna</b>
<b>make a huge goddamn mistake.</b>

39:46.523 --> 39:48.091
<b>- My vote is for Carolyn to go</b>
<b>home.</b>

39:48.092 --> 39:49.659
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

39:49.660 --> 39:53.763
<b>Carolyn, you do not have what it</b>
<b>takes to be an Ink Master.</b>

39:53.764 --> 39:55.164
<b>- This is a tough environment.</b>

39:55.165 --> 39:56.265
<b>It is not for everybody.</b>

39:56.266 --> 39:57.867
<b>It's a lot of pressure.</b>

39:57.868 --> 39:59.235
<b>- All right, Carolyn.</b>

39:59.236 --> 40:00.876
<b>Please, pack your machines and</b>
<b>close shop.</b>

40:04.308 --> 40:07.110
<b>- I didn't show, like,</b>
<b>not even a fraction of</b>

40:07.111 --> 40:09.445
<b>what the [bleep] I can do.</b>

40:09.446 --> 40:11.180
<b>They made a wrong choice.</b>

40:11.181 --> 40:14.684
<b>Nuñez thinks that Tito's</b>
<b>gonna make his team go farther.</b>

40:14.685 --> 40:15.986
<b>No way.</b>

40:20.190 --> 40:22.425
<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</b>
<b>of "Ink Master"...</i> </b>

40:22.426 --> 40:24.560
<b>- This week, Team Peck,</b>
<b>you're up for elimination.</b>

40:24.561 --> 40:27.029
<b>We've brought the beach here.</b>

40:27.030 --> 40:29.632
<b>- [yells]</b>

40:29.633 --> 40:31.467
<b>- I'm basically against my team.</b>

40:31.468 --> 40:33.503
<b>- They're gonna [bleep]</b>
<b>you over so quick.</b>

40:33.504 --> 40:35.505
<b>- Today, you were on Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>buddy.</b>

40:35.506 --> 40:37.707
<b>- You put me in a compromising</b>
<b>situation.</b>

40:37.708 --> 40:39.242
<b>- Hey, Team Peck, calm down.</b>

40:39.243 --> 40:41.277
<b>What you guys need to worry</b>
<b>about is not what happened.</b>

40:41.278 --> 40:43.513
<b>It's about who's gonna go home</b>
<b>this week.</b>

40:43.514 --> 40:44.614
<b>- Unfinished, man.</b>

40:44.615 --> 40:46.449
<b>You just gave yourself an</b>
<b>eyesore.</b>

40:46.450 --> 40:47.450
<b>- You want to pay your rent?</b>

40:47.451 --> 40:48.651
<b>You tattoo that [bleep] canvas.</b>

40:48.652 --> 40:50.887
<b>- This thing is rough.</b>

40:50.888 --> 40:52.556
<b>- My critique's totally</b>
<b>different.</b>
