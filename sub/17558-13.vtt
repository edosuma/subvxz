WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.537
Well, Milena,
everything looks great,

00:03.571 --> 00:05.473
and the nanny agency
certainly loves you.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.541
We just have
a couple more questions for you.

00:07.575 --> 00:08.542
Tiny things.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.078
Can you list
the systematic differences

00:10.111 --> 00:12.646
between the common
cold and sinusitis?

00:12.680 --> 00:15.649
And please give me both western
and naturopathic responses.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.352
BRYAN:
The Internet has both helped and
hurt man's development. Discuss.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.987
DAVID:
Muppets or puppets?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.356
And if you'll please,
Ernie or Bert?

00:22.390 --> 00:23.357
Our child's hungry,

00:23.391 --> 00:24.492
but there's only
Swiss chard,

00:24.525 --> 00:26.094
a can of sardines,
and marshmallows in the house.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.528
What do you make?

00:27.561 --> 00:28.662
It's Ernie.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.399
(stopwatch ticking)

00:31.432 --> 00:34.102
BRYAN:
Time.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.669
Thank you for coming.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.438
Our son hurts himself--

00:37.471 --> 00:39.340
nothing serious,
just a skinned knee--

00:39.373 --> 00:42.009
but in that moment, the shock
of the pain terrifies him.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.178
The world seems
chaotic and cruel.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.414
He needs a source
of total love and protection,

00:46.447 --> 00:49.016
and as his big teary eyes
look up at you,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.017
what do you do?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.286
I put butter on it?

00:52.320 --> 00:54.555
Thank you
for coming.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.593
Well, that was
depressing.

00:59.627 --> 01:03.131
11 prospective nannies and not
one of them makes the cut.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.466
I know, and I do not think we
are being that hard to please.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.700
Have you been touching
my things?

01:06.734 --> 01:09.537
Bry, I don't want
to hire a nanny.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.239
I'm so happy you're saying this.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.207
Of course,
one of us

01:13.241 --> 01:15.276
would have to quit work
for a while.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.044
Me, me-- please
let it be me.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.546
I've always wanted to
be a stay-at-home dad.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.047
I'll have playdates
and I'll worry

01:20.080 --> 01:21.249
about the croup,
whatever that is,

01:21.282 --> 01:22.783
and-and I'll hang
on his every "goo-goo"

01:22.816 --> 01:24.051
and "Lady Gaga."

01:24.084 --> 01:25.453
Really, you'd be willing
to do that?

01:25.486 --> 01:29.757
'Cause I was kind of thinking
that I could do it, too.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.426
David, you're a doctor.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.462
Your job is life-or-death.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.297
I'm just a simple
television producer

01:36.330 --> 01:39.433
that's changed the world and
sets the cultural barometer,

01:39.467 --> 01:41.302
and besides, Sing!
writes itself.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.736
Bry, in all the years
that I've known you,

01:42.770 --> 01:45.072
you've woken up early once,
and that was to watch

01:45.105 --> 01:47.074
Kate and William's
royal wedding in real time.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.310
David, I can do this.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.511
It's in the bag.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.482
(knocking)

01:54.515 --> 01:56.417
Hey!
Surprise!

01:56.450 --> 01:57.485
Hey, look at you,

01:57.518 --> 02:00.321
sweating like Ann Coulter
in an Iranian mosque.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.790
(laughing):
I don't know what any
of those words are.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.259
(laughter)
So, what's going on?

02:05.293 --> 02:06.260
With your birthday coming up,

02:06.294 --> 02:07.495
we thought
we would treat you

02:07.528 --> 02:10.097
to some much
deserved pampering.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.098
(gasps)

02:11.131 --> 02:12.633
Wha...?

02:14.168 --> 02:16.204
A week-long stay
at the Serenity Spa in Sedona?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.538
Is it safe

02:17.571 --> 02:18.806
to travel to Mexico?

02:18.839 --> 02:21.108
It's in Arizona
and it's fabulous.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.811
You can even get a hot
pebble massage for the baby.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.613
Oh, this is very sweet, guys,

02:25.646 --> 02:28.316
but I can't just leave Shania
for a week.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.450
We will watch Shania.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.386
Boom. Bryan thinks he can be
a stay-at-home dad.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.787
And David doesn't think
I can do it,

02:33.821 --> 02:35.623
but once I set my mind to
something, I always succeed.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.492
Did I not put together that
IKEA footstool for Goldie?

02:38.526 --> 02:39.527
It was a solitary block.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.794
Mm-hmm.
Oh, this is
so generous.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.129
I mean,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.464
I haven't been
on vacation since

02:43.497 --> 02:44.532
Shania was born.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.301
So... will you take us up
on our offer?

02:47.335 --> 02:48.369
Are you kidding?

02:48.402 --> 02:49.537
I'm gonna go pack now.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.638
Viva Sedona!

02:50.671 --> 02:52.139
(both cheering)

02:52.172 --> 02:56.510
In my opinion the color palate
flat-out does not work.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.213
Just a warning: Bryan's
going to hate it.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.816
I like how the red lamp
complements

03:02.850 --> 03:04.318
the pink flame duvet.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.719
I like the story
that it tells,

03:05.753 --> 03:08.522
if this were a teen whorehouse
in a John Hughes movie.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.723
Total redo.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.525
Where have you been?

03:11.559 --> 03:12.693
You missed rehearsal
the other night.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.827
Did you follow
Bebe Neuwirth

03:13.861 --> 03:15.529
home from
the gas station again?

03:15.563 --> 03:17.398
Yes. Rocky, I've
come to a decision.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.200
When my baby comes, I'm
gonna go on paternity leave.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.835
I'm gonna be a
stay-at-home dad.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.837
(laughs)

03:23.871 --> 03:25.839
You, a stay-at-home-dad?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.342
That's like me being
a featured actress on Girls.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.843
Who's gonna take over
while you're gone?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.412
Well, I guess the Sing!
writers can handle it.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.280
They have nothing
else to do

03:32.313 --> 03:33.281
with their lives
except buy

03:33.314 --> 03:34.348
more ill-fitting
fleece items.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.283
Excuse me,

03:35.316 --> 03:36.284
you need a producer

03:36.317 --> 03:37.685
to hold this ship
together.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.719
You need a captain.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.588
You need me.
Ha!

03:40.621 --> 03:42.590
Bryan, I've dreamt
of being a producer

03:42.623 --> 03:44.258
ever since I was a kid.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.694
I produced my own version
of Fat Albert.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.363
Even did my own spin-off.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.698
Cut, cut, cut!

03:50.731 --> 03:53.434
This is Fat Albert: The Revenge,
people.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.702
Now, Fat Albert,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.870
eat the little white girl!

03:56.904 --> 03:59.907
Well, Rocky, I didn't realize
you wanted to be a producer.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.775
Let me prove to you
that I can do this.

04:01.809 --> 04:02.710
I don't know if
you're ready.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.711
Hi, Bry.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.812
Hi.
Hate to interrupt,

04:04.845 --> 04:07.915
but my character
would never say this stuff.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.650
Oh, so you don't
like what's written?

04:09.683 --> 04:11.218
Maybe you'll like
what I wrote.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.620
Interior, basement.
Night.

04:12.653 --> 04:16.324
Brynn, in her cheer uniform,
lays tied up on a cold table.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.891
A crazy hunchback
enters and stabs her

04:17.925 --> 04:19.226
several times
in the face.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.461
We cut to
the hospital,

04:20.494 --> 04:22.630
and sure enough,
Brynn survives

04:22.663 --> 04:24.231
but needs a
face transplant.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.466
Enter

04:25.499 --> 04:28.469
Demi Lovato, who will
do it for cheap.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.771
I'll do it as written.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.476
The ship is yours.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.449
(sighs)

04:43.717 --> 04:45.653
I can't stop eating pottery
and cigarette ashes.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.355
Hey, you two.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.423
Ew, what is
that smell?

04:49.457 --> 04:50.424
We're watching
a marathon

04:50.458 --> 04:51.625
of My Strange Addiction
and eating

04:51.659 --> 04:53.494
some of the "safely edible"
obsessions from the show.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.295
I ate cotton.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.931
Well, it's 10:00.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.767
Headed to bed.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.636
I think it's a little
past Shania's bedtime, too?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.638
I'm pretty sure
Shania can handle
a few more episodes, right?

05:04.672 --> 05:05.773
We can't stop now.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.375
We haven't found
out what happens

05:07.408 --> 05:09.610
to that lady who eats
her dead husband's ashes.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.445
Okay.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.713
Bry, I hope you know that,

05:12.746 --> 05:14.682
when the baby comes, gonna have
to keep him on a schedule.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.384
Babies need structure.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.318
Aw, would you eat
my ashes, babe?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.990
WOMAN:
I think you need help
for this, I think...

05:23.023 --> 05:24.825
SHANIA:
Bryan!

05:26.026 --> 05:27.961
Bry, Shania's calling you.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.797
Shh, I took a Lunesta.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.864
You can't take sleeping pills

05:30.898 --> 05:32.299
when you're responsible
for a child.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.467
As long as Dr. Daddy is here,

05:33.501 --> 05:34.535
Papa's going to pill down.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.669
Bryan!

05:35.703 --> 05:38.872
BRYAN:
All right, I'm on it.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.408
Are you okay?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.975
What's wrong?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.310
I can't sleep.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.312
That creepy mobile
above the crib is making

05:45.345 --> 05:46.980
scary shadows on the wall.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.982
This is an ancient
Mayan goddess of sleep;

05:49.016 --> 05:50.484
it's very chic.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.352
Oh, my God, that is terrifying.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.488
It's just that I've never woken
up in the middle of the night

05:54.522 --> 05:56.323
and not had my mom there
to comfort me.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.357
Oh.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.359
Once upon a time,

05:59.393 --> 06:01.361
I saw a woman
named Uma Thurman

06:01.395 --> 06:03.564
without any makeup on

06:03.597 --> 06:05.032
under the harsh
fluorescent lights

06:05.065 --> 06:07.935
of a Walgreens at
2:00 in the morning,

06:07.968 --> 06:11.004
clutching a six-pack
of vanilla Ensure.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.573
(yawning):
And...

06:12.606 --> 06:13.907
Oh, wait,
that story is too scary.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.375
I'm so sorry.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.446
I'm so glad you're here,
Bryan; you're the best.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.014
I almost don't miss my...

06:21.048 --> 06:23.016
Come on,
Bryan, wake up.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.017
It's 7:30.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.519
Oh, 7:30, thank God.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.854
Three more hours of sleep.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.856
No, you have exactly 20
minutes to make my breakfast,

06:28.889 --> 06:30.458
pack my lunch, quiz me
on my spelling words,

06:30.491 --> 06:31.625
and drive me to school.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.060
School, yes, right, on it!

06:33.093 --> 06:34.462
Here you go!

06:35.629 --> 06:37.631
Oh.

06:38.832 --> 06:42.736
An avocado, a club soda,
and a wheel of Brie?

06:42.770 --> 06:43.937
Well, I could give you
Camembert,

06:43.971 --> 06:45.573
but I doubt your palate
is sophisticated enough

06:45.606 --> 06:46.740
to appreciate
the difference.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.809
(clicks tongue)
Come on, let's go!

06:48.842 --> 06:50.711
(school bell ringing)

06:50.744 --> 06:52.780
Bye, honey! Have a
good day at school!

06:52.813 --> 06:54.882
Learn stuff
you can Google later.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.884
Hi.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.486
I'm Courtney,
this is Tasha.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.054
We are the school's
parent project coordinators.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.756
Oh, um, I am Bryan.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.392
I'm taking care of Shania
while her mom's away.
Wonderful.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.561
My son's Ethan, and
he's right over there

07:07.595 --> 07:09.396
playing with
Courtney's son Ethan.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.833
Oh, um, oh, look at them--
they're, they're like two little

07:12.866 --> 07:14.401
perfect Vegas magicians.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.669
How'd you get 'em
out the door like that?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.070
I barely had time
to get pants on Shania.
I relate.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.673
Yesterday, after strength
training, I do the housework,

07:19.707 --> 07:20.908
work on my blog--
which is kind of

07:20.941 --> 07:22.442
a Girl, Interrupted at 40
kind of thing--

07:22.476 --> 07:24.077
marinate an osso buco
for dinner,

07:24.111 --> 07:25.913
meditate,
and it hits me:

07:25.946 --> 07:27.648
I haven't prepared
Ethan's vegan lunch

07:27.681 --> 07:29.082
for school tomorrow yet.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.084
How did you possibly get
all that done in time?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.986
I did.
Of course she did.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.088
Anyway, we're holding a
princess tea and social

07:35.122 --> 07:36.924
tomorrow and we
were wondering

07:36.957 --> 07:39.960
if you, as
Shania's caretaker,

07:39.993 --> 07:41.929
had time to provide
decorations.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.664
I do, oh, I definitely do.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.665
Great-- it
is so nice

07:44.698 --> 07:45.866
to meet you.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.134
Nice to meet you.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.169
Bye.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.106
There go
the Botoxic Avengers.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.808
(both chuckle)

07:54.842 --> 07:56.810
Are you a Christian dude
who preaches to kids

07:56.844 --> 07:58.111
not to do drugs
or something?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.947
Oh, no, no, uh...

07:59.980 --> 08:01.682
I'm a dad.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.683
I'm a stay-at-home dad.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.619
Good times, huh?
(chuckles)

08:05.653 --> 08:07.788
Having a four-foot tall boss
who screams

08:07.821 --> 08:10.123
and sneezes in your face.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.059
I love taking
care of a child.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.828
I-I love that that's
my daily life.

08:14.862 --> 08:15.963
See, I see
what you're doing there.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.964
(baby crying)
Aw...

08:16.997 --> 08:18.031
Here, let me try one.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.569
Tonight my wife
won't visibly recoil

08:21.602 --> 08:22.636
at my touch.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.705
She's lost
all respect for me.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.473
(crying)

08:26.506 --> 08:28.842
And I don't blame her.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.781
Oh.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.486
(chimes)

08:39.519 --> 08:41.254
Start.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.724
Start.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.525
Start, start, start, start.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.596
(ringtone playing)

08:48.629 --> 08:49.663
Hola, Goldie.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.498
How's Sedona?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.166
(moans)
Awesome.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.502
I can't stop eating
the cucumber on my face.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.870
I wish I had ranch dressing.

08:56.904 --> 08:57.838
(sighs weakly)
How's Shania?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.006
I'm, I'm just checking in.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.173
Oh, she is great.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.175
She's happy,
she's just, you know,

09:02.209 --> 09:03.611
wise beyond her years.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.045
Um, silly question.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.047
David wants to know how to use

09:07.080 --> 09:08.515
the washing machine.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.583
Oh, Bryan,

09:09.617 --> 09:11.685
a man has entered
with a bacon sandwich,

09:11.719 --> 09:14.021
and there's a lady
with big thumbs rubbing my feet.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.589
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can concentrate

09:15.623 --> 09:16.757
on what you're saying anymore.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.525
Just put four quarters
in the machine

09:18.558 --> 09:20.027
and push the biggest knob.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.061
All right, thanks.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.898
(ringtone playing)
No, n-n-no.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.735
Bryan Collins, stay-at-home dad.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.037
Shania threw up?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.171
Was it on purpose?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.644
I need it to be darker.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.181
I need it to
be brighter.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.817
I need soup.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.989
I want chicken noodle.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.593
I'm cold,
I need more blankets.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.798
Triangles?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.834
I'm hot, I want a fan.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.270
I want to watch
House Hunters International.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.673
Will you play with my hair?

10:07.875 --> 10:10.243
What's a vagina for
other than peeing?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.079
I want you to draw
a picture of me,

10:12.112 --> 10:13.981
but as a pig
eating a ham sandwich.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.249
Sing me an esoteric
Broadway medley.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.085
Watch cataract surgery
with me on YouTube.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.953
I'm gonna try peanuts
for the first time.

10:19.987 --> 10:20.988
I want to play video games.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.155
I want my mommy.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.824
I need water. I need air.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.626
I'm bored.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.136
Hey, Bry,

10:36.169 --> 10:37.971
how was your day?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.606
What, is the pilot light out
or something?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.876
I'm trying to figure out
how Sylvia Plath did it.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.779
I can't do it, David.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.981
I said I could be a stay-at-home
dad, but I can't do it.

10:48.015 --> 10:48.982
You have to do it.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.718
SHANIA (in distance):
Bryan!

10:50.751 --> 10:54.387
Help me, please.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.362
(alarm beeping)

11:03.396 --> 11:05.198
It's the middle of the night.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.366
It's 7:00,

11:06.399 --> 11:07.835
and it's just dark

11:07.868 --> 11:09.469
'cause you have your
sleep mask on.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.839
Don't worry.
Daddy David's on the job.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.916
Shania. Shania?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.517
Morning, sunshine.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.053
Looks like you're
feeling better.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.187
Time to get ready for school.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.188
But, David...

11:28.221 --> 11:29.489
I brought you some
hot chocolate,

11:29.522 --> 11:30.557
your slippers are
beside the bed,

11:30.590 --> 11:31.992
and I don't want
to rush you,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.526
but breakfast
is ready downstairs.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.929
Hot chocolate?
Slippers? Breakfast?

11:35.963 --> 11:37.865
It's like I'm at a spa
like my mom.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.366
Uh-huh. Come on.
It's a beautiful day.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.535
T minus 60 minutes
to go over your math homework

11:42.569 --> 11:44.838
and your spelling words--
I cannot decide

11:44.872 --> 11:46.506
which one I want to do first--

11:46.539 --> 11:49.376
and I will have you at school
with plenty of time to spare.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.410
David, you don't...

11:50.443 --> 11:52.946
And... if we have
any time left,

11:52.980 --> 11:54.882
we can go through
your yearbook and I will

11:54.915 --> 11:56.516
tell you which one
of the boys you like

11:56.549 --> 11:58.118
are slam-dunk gays.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.254
I thought you said
school starts at 8:45.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.291
SHANIA:
It does. Just not on Saturday.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.894
What? It's Sat... it's Saturday.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.295
Why didn't you tell me?

12:08.328 --> 12:11.031
I tried, but you were so excited
about staying on schedule.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.365
And you gave me
hot chocolate.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.867
I mean, I'm jacked up.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.035
The only thing
I have today

12:15.068 --> 12:16.269
is a princess tea and social

12:16.303 --> 12:17.437
at my friend Bianca's house,

12:17.470 --> 12:19.239
but that's
not till 3:00.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.041
What do we do until then?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.210
Ooh! We could go
to RadioShack

12:23.243 --> 12:25.245
and check out
the new cell phone skins.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.247
SHANIA:
I'm bored.
(David groans)

12:27.280 --> 12:29.282
I know it's Saturday,
but this is an emergency.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.551
I've been getting reports about
your behavior on set this week.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.988
And do these reports include
words such as "excellent" and...

12:35.022 --> 12:36.556
"professional"
and "fine as hell"?

12:36.589 --> 12:39.092
Rocky, I put my empire
in your hands,

12:39.126 --> 12:40.894
and you've run around
terrorizing people

12:40.928 --> 12:42.529
like Christian Bale in heels.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.433
Cut!

12:46.466 --> 12:47.901
Hey, I'm the director.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.937
I yell "cut."
Not anymore you don't!

12:49.970 --> 12:51.905
This is not iCarly.

12:51.939 --> 12:52.940
I want shirts off.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.141
Girls' tops, too.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.575
This is a sex scene!

12:55.608 --> 12:58.912
And the key to good sex
is moisture, even teen sex!

12:58.946 --> 12:59.913
Makeup!

12:59.947 --> 13:00.914
Lather 'em up!

13:00.948 --> 13:02.315
And when I say "action,"

13:02.349 --> 13:04.184
I want to see tongues.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.586
Where's the water?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.989
The production will
no longer be providing

13:09.022 --> 13:11.291
expensive bottled water.
You want some,

13:11.324 --> 13:13.360
get it from the park
on your way to work

13:13.393 --> 13:15.462
and store it in the hump
on your back.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.496
But I'm thirsty now.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.031
Why the hell you need water

13:18.065 --> 13:21.534
when we have orange
and purple Fantas right here?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.470
Look!

13:23.503 --> 13:25.973
Are you writers all brain-dead?!

13:26.006 --> 13:28.508
Another Barbra Streisand medley?

13:28.541 --> 13:29.943
This is a high school show.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.345
It is not believable
that a 16-year-old girl

13:32.379 --> 13:34.181
played by a 26-year-old actress

13:34.214 --> 13:36.516
would be singing songs
by a 70-year-old lady.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.518
We're gonna get
some real music on this show.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.620
This is R. Kelly.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.289
Trapped in the Closet.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.625
And we will be reenacting
all 40 chapters.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.627
Um, this thing is
90 minutes long.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.329
And?
We're an hour show.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.199
Well, then you'd better
write small, nerds.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.334
You used the N-word.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.335
I know.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.503
And I called them nerds.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.971
I trusted you at a time

13:58.005 --> 13:59.006
when I was completely
overwhelmed,

13:59.039 --> 14:00.473
and now I have
to spend the entire week

14:00.507 --> 14:01.474
putting out your fires.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.010
I-I'm sorry.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.078
I really thought I was doing
my best for you.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.413
(sniffles)
If you need me...

14:07.514 --> 14:09.482
...I'll be at
Crustacean Restaurant,

14:09.516 --> 14:12.119
drowning my sorrows
in black bean crab.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.590
There's everything you need.
And thanks again

14:17.624 --> 14:19.726
for agreeing to host
the party at the last minute.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.661
I can't believe the
PTA decided to schedule

14:21.694 --> 14:24.164
an emergency meeting today.
We're spearheading

14:24.197 --> 14:27.000
an anti-name-calling campaign,
and if we're not there,

14:27.034 --> 14:30.037
those brain-dead morons
will just screw it up.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.106
DAVID:
Okay, princess party.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.174
Before we get started, I thought

14:34.207 --> 14:35.608
we could all get
to know each other.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.643
Cupcakes!

14:39.712 --> 14:41.681
I know. Let's start
with cupcakes.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.252
Okay, miladies,
hope the tea is to your liking.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.255
Why are you talking to us
like that? We're not four.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.257
My apologies, Princess Rebecca.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.458
(British accent):
Off with me head.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.593
(normal voice):
Whoa.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.561
Tough castle.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.030
Hey, where you going?

14:57.064 --> 15:00.467
Rebecca and Erin are ignoring
me, so I'm going to take a bath.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.703
Take a bath? No, no, no.
Wait, you can't take a bath.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.205
Shania, will you go
talk to her, please?

15:05.238 --> 15:07.074
I don't really
know her that well.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.309
Your wife looks like a man.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.044
Whoa, where you
guys going?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.713
(bowl clatters)
It doesn't belong
in the ballroom.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.316
(water running)
(sighs)

15:16.349 --> 15:18.051
(girls giggling, shouting)

15:18.085 --> 15:20.053
Oh!

15:20.087 --> 15:21.321
(laughs)

15:22.355 --> 15:25.258
All right. Let me jump in!

15:26.193 --> 15:28.228
Oh, my Lord. Oh!

15:28.261 --> 15:29.429
Ow.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.064
You hit my face with the zipper.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.633
I'm gonna have
to get plastic surgery.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.439
I honestly don't know why

15:39.472 --> 15:42.442
your daddy wants to live alone
in an apartment.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.611
(girls giggling)

15:44.644 --> 15:46.579
I thought you were gonna put
makeup on yourselves.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.081
Quiet, peasant!

15:48.115 --> 15:51.084
I really couldn't
conjecture who the woman is

15:51.118 --> 15:53.186
that keeps calling
your house. Maybe...

15:53.220 --> 15:55.455
it's a business associate
of your father's.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.291
Charge!

15:59.292 --> 16:00.593
Charge!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.462
Charge!

16:02.495 --> 16:05.165
(singing "Charge" fanfare)
Oh, my God.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.135
Where did you get
all those scissors?!

16:09.836 --> 16:11.404
Ha!

16:12.472 --> 16:14.107
Girls?

16:14.141 --> 16:16.343
They went upstairs to look
through your nightstand.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.345
My nightst...

16:22.582 --> 16:25.485
Look, we found
your see-through lotion.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.654
Mmm, it tastes
like strawberries.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.760
I want to taste it.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.400
David! Are you up here?

16:40.433 --> 16:41.868
(Smelly whimpers)
(Bryan chuckles)

16:42.835 --> 16:44.404
How was the party?

16:44.437 --> 16:47.006
I was sure that I could
do it better than you,

16:47.040 --> 16:48.708
but I couldn't.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.744
They're dressed like princesses,
but they're monsters.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.480
(chuckles)

16:53.513 --> 16:55.348
Monsters.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.649
I know.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.451
We'll figure it out.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.654
Is that my tiara?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.556
So, you like babies?

17:03.590 --> 17:04.891
Oh, yes. Very much.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.326
Do you know
how to purée a carrot?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.328
N-No, but I'm happy to learn.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.829
Sounds good.
You seem great.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.999
No! You cannot
hire a nanny.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.501
No offense.
I'm sure you're wonderful.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.668
(whispers):
Bitch.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.504
BRYAN:
Goldie, what are you
doing back here?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.339
You still have
four more days at the spa.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.340
Shania called me.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.841
She said she was worried
about you guys.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.577
(sighs)
We're sorry, Goldie.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.878
We thought we could
do it, but...

17:25.912 --> 17:28.515
we can't. We need
professional help.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.016
No. You don't.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.852
Every parent in the history
of parenting goes through this.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.788
They think they can't handle it,
that it's all gonna fall apart.

17:35.822 --> 17:39.025
And the truth is, sometimes
it all falls apart.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.361
That was... comforting advice.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.795
I'm not gonna lie to you guys.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.731
Raising a kid is hard.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.598
But...

17:45.632 --> 17:46.733
you figure it out.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.035
I mean, I more or less
did it alone.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.370
But you two have each other.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.738
Yeah, but we both suck.
Mm.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.873
You both have
different strengths.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.909
David, you are practical
and organized.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.911
Bryan, you're fun
and creative.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.480
I don't think
I like my strengths.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.048
You don't have to be great
at everything,

18:02.081 --> 18:04.484
as long as each of you
is great at something.

18:05.785 --> 18:06.953
You know what?

18:06.986 --> 18:08.921
Keep Shania for one more day.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.525
You'll see.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.463
(romantic instrumental plays)

18:20.833 --> 18:23.136
(sighs) I came as soon
as I got your text.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.738
You didn't say what it was
about, but I randomly bought you

18:25.772 --> 18:28.675
a latte and the ointment for
that of which we do not speak.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.778
No, no, no, no.
It's not about any of that.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.513
I've been watching
the episode of Sing!

18:33.546 --> 18:35.114
that you produced in my absence.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.784
And it's fantastic.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.919
It's one of the best. Ever.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.822
Oh, my God. I can't believe
the episode made you cry.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.857
(chuckles) It did, but that's
not why I'm emotional.

18:44.891 --> 18:48.428
You shaved 22%
off the show's budget.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.096
Because you cut
bottled water, the studio

18:50.129 --> 18:51.798
is honoring me
as environmentally conscious

18:51.831 --> 18:52.799
instead of cheap.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.967
You are brilliant,

18:55.001 --> 18:57.937
you are fierce,
and you are fine as hell.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.106
And it is a privilege
to play any part

19:00.139 --> 19:01.674
in making your dreams come true.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.677
(chuckles)
Are you serious?

19:04.711 --> 19:07.547
Because if you're not,
I will snap you in half.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.148
No, no, no. It's not a joke.

19:09.182 --> 19:12.118
I do have one more low-level
task for you to perform though.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.620
Okay.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.988
Can you get me
that chair over there?

19:31.070 --> 19:32.138
How much did
that chair cost?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.640
And what part
of the budget

19:33.673 --> 19:35.475
did you take it from?
Because this show

19:35.508 --> 19:37.143
is not paying for
that damn thing.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.746
Just so you know.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.020
DAVID: Ever wonder why we call
a mom who works

19:48.054 --> 19:50.490
"a working mom" and a dad

19:50.523 --> 19:52.525
who works
is just called "a dad"?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.994
Well, for eons, women were

19:55.027 --> 19:57.864
the unsung heroes
of raising the kids.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.833
They tended the cave while men
were hunting, gathering,

20:00.867 --> 20:03.903
pillaging, and eventually
donning sharp suits

20:03.936 --> 20:06.939
to work in ad agencies
and host game shows.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.176
But families
look different now.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.345
No matter what their gender,
all that matters

20:12.379 --> 20:14.046
is being lucky enough
Thank you.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.048
to have a partner to count on,

20:16.082 --> 20:17.850
an ally who'll always
have your back.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.852
Thank you.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.455
BRYAN: They are the strengths
to your weaknesses,

20:22.489 --> 20:25.392
the yin to your yang,
the Kathie Lee to your Hoda.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.261
Look at the face more.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.263
Ready?
Uh-huh.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.367
Perfect.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.536
So, in a right
triangle, the sum of

20:36.569 --> 20:39.272
the square of the
legs is equal to?

20:39.306 --> 20:41.040
The square of the hypotenuse?

20:41.073 --> 20:44.544
And in 2005 which movie won the
Academy Award for Best Picture?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.545
(sighs)
Crash.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.213
I know.
I don't get it either.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.148
Here you go.
Thanks.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.950
Have a good day!

20:50.983 --> 20:52.218
BRYAN:
Occasionally, you'll run

20:52.251 --> 20:53.886
into a fellow
stay-at-home warrior

20:53.920 --> 20:56.323
who's struggling with
the relentless chaos of doing

20:56.356 --> 20:58.458
the hardest job in the world.
Aw, come here.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.992
When you see
one of these pioneers,

21:00.026 --> 21:01.994
appreciate that
they were trailblazers

21:02.028 --> 21:03.463
for the rest of us.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.931
And in the end,
if you're feeling overwhelmed,

21:04.964 --> 21:06.933
sometimes you just
have to admit

21:06.966 --> 21:08.935
that no one person
can do everything.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.938
At least not well.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.407
DAVID: Sure, it'll take us a bit
to work out the kinks

21:14.441 --> 21:17.777
of this whole
stay-at-home dad thing.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.514
BRYAN: And are we gonna
make mistakes? Sure.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.782
But at least
we'll make them...

21:22.815 --> 21:24.651
BOTH:
Together.
