anything to you? You lie.

- Bye, love.

Vivian: I'm telling you,

00:09.033 --> 00:10.377
apart from having a fatal disease,

00:10.402 --> 00:11.802
my life kicks ass.

00:11.837 --> 00:12.937
Alec: Why are you here alone?

00:12.972 --> 00:13.838
After a major procedure,

00:13.873 --> 00:15.594
why is there not someone here with you?

00:15.619 --> 00:17.456
Men like women with their hair down...

00:17.481 --> 00:20.015
at least your husband does.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.120
I thought we weren't talking.

00:21.145 --> 00:23.013
We're not.

00:31.754 --> 00:33.821
[Sighs]

00:39.015 --> 00:40.182
Hey.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.452
Hey.

00:42.572 --> 00:44.373
How long have you been staring at me?

00:44.398 --> 00:45.351
Oh...

00:45.417 --> 00:47.638
20-ish minutes, give or take.

00:47.663 --> 00:48.669
Oh.

00:48.694 --> 00:49.513
Is that weird?

00:49.538 --> 00:51.388
Oh... [Chuckles]

00:51.413 --> 00:53.017
We passed weird a long time ago.

00:53.311 --> 00:55.613
Then in that case, I'd like to uh...

00:55.648 --> 00:57.517
Just keep looking at you.

00:59.205 --> 01:00.873
- Ow!
- [Chuckles]

01:00.898 --> 01:01.920
What was that for?

01:01.944 --> 01:05.310
I just... I want to make sure
that this is actually happening.

01:05.334 --> 01:05.849
Is this real?

01:05.874 --> 01:07.608
Yes, and I'm pretty sure

01:07.633 --> 01:09.000
you're supposed to pinch yourself.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.419
Right. [Laughs]

01:10.444 --> 01:11.099
Sorry.

01:11.124 --> 01:14.360
Yeah, and, secondly, was that a, um...

01:14.385 --> 01:17.185
"This feels so good, I
can't believe it's happening"

01:17.210 --> 01:19.186
kind of pinch or...

01:19.406 --> 01:22.446
I can't believe what a
colossal mistake I've made?

01:22.471 --> 01:23.605
No, no, no, no, no.

01:23.630 --> 01:24.423
It was a positive pinch.

01:24.448 --> 01:25.728
- Yeah?
- So positive.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.885
[Chuckles]

01:27.647 --> 01:28.735
What about you?

01:28.760 --> 01:31.251
Are you having regrets or...

01:31.276 --> 01:32.321
Oh, yeah, this sucks.

01:32.346 --> 01:33.930
- Huh?
- Are you kidding?

01:33.955 --> 01:34.955
Oh!

01:35.023 --> 01:36.212
You're mean!

01:36.237 --> 01:37.204
What are you talking about?

01:37.229 --> 01:38.163
I can't see my face,

01:38.188 --> 01:39.665
but I feel like I'm grinning like an idiot.

01:39.690 --> 01:40.853
[Laughs] You are.

01:40.877 --> 01:43.516
- [Laughs]
- I grin like that?

01:43.541 --> 01:45.427
[Laughs] A little bit.

01:45.567 --> 01:47.432
I know what you mean, though.

01:47.457 --> 01:48.790
Hmm?

01:48.815 --> 01:52.717
Never in a million years
from where we started

01:53.249 --> 01:55.117
did I think we'd end up here.

01:58.137 --> 02:01.292
And where would you say we are?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.134

Calista Raines is not putting her designs

02:29.742 --> 02:31.709
in some low-end retail store.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.968
Well, she's a dying breed of artist, then.

02:33.993 --> 02:35.260
And you know what?

02:35.285 --> 02:36.722
You stop calling her directly.

02:36.747 --> 02:39.976
I'm the C.E.O., you come to me.
She's got enough on her plate.

02:40.001 --> 02:41.802
Come on.

02:42.165 --> 02:43.665
Sorry you had to hear that.

Am I supposed to thank you now?

[Sniffles] What's wrong?

02:46.631 --> 02:48.205
Hmm, what's wrong?

02:49.195 --> 02:52.497
You screwed Eva Petrov...
that's what's wrong.

02:52.522 --> 02:52.973
What?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.207
Yeah, and right before

02:54.233 --> 02:56.755
the biggest runway show of my career.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.318
You truly are a disgusting man.

02:59.343 --> 03:01.018
Wait a minute. Hold up.

03:01.042 --> 03:01.973
I didn't sleep with Eva.

03:01.998 --> 03:02.996
Where are you even getting this?

03:03.022 --> 03:04.356
From her crooked little mouth.

03:04.381 --> 03:05.379
Come on!

03:05.405 --> 03:07.073
If you continue to smile like that,

03:07.098 --> 03:08.481
I'm going to smash your face.

03:09.498 --> 03:13.778
She made it up, Cal, okay,
to gall you, and it worked.

03:13.803 --> 03:15.103
And why would she do that?

03:15.128 --> 03:16.770
Because she's an 80-pound child

03:16.795 --> 03:19.075
who you humiliated in
front of the other models.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.469
It was her, it was last
week at G'Auberge Hotel,

03:22.494 --> 03:23.950
it was the blonde.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.689
Helga Bernard?

03:28.332 --> 03:31.267
She runs our showroom in New York.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.630
I had a drink with her.

03:32.655 --> 03:35.830
We had dinner in the
restaurant with her fiancé.

03:38.058 --> 03:40.587
Look, I... I get it, you know?

03:40.612 --> 03:42.239
My mistake in the past

03:42.264 --> 03:43.997
is causing you to doubt me in the present,

03:44.022 --> 03:45.997
and that's my fault.

03:46.221 --> 03:49.290
But I am trying to change that.

03:53.029 --> 03:55.497
Tomorrow's our 10-year
wedding anniversary.

03:57.492 --> 03:59.362
Will you have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

03:59.387 --> 04:01.622
- [Sighs]
- 'Cause I would like to celebrate it with you.

04:01.647 --> 04:03.714
I made a reservation at Luke's,

04:03.739 --> 04:06.456
where, if you recall,
I got down on one knee,

04:06.480 --> 04:07.913
and I proposed to you.

04:09.217 --> 04:12.319
If the date still means something to you,

04:12.344 --> 04:13.728
please come.

04:15.127 --> 04:16.428
I just wanted you to know

04:16.452 --> 04:18.688
that it still means something to me.

04:23.498 --> 04:24.464
I can't talk right now.

04:24.489 --> 04:26.276
I'm about to meet with
Lucy's new headmaster.

04:26.301 --> 04:27.401
Are we still on for tonight?

04:27.426 --> 04:28.675
Hold on, Joss.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.612
I got to go.

04:30.637 --> 04:31.744
You must be April.

04:31.769 --> 04:32.838
Sorry I'm late.

04:32.863 --> 04:35.190
Oh, we're fine. That's... that's fine.

04:35.215 --> 04:36.672
You're... you're fine.

04:36.697 --> 04:39.290
Please, have a seat.
Let me grab Lucy's file.

04:39.315 --> 04:41.090
[School bell rings in distance]

04:42.117 --> 04:44.963
Uh, first, I just wanted to apologize

04:44.988 --> 04:46.856
for missing your welcome brunch.

04:46.881 --> 04:50.744
And I have noticed Lucy's
new "cover girl" look,

04:50.769 --> 04:51.830
and I am all over it.

04:51.855 --> 04:53.789
Good, but that's not why I
asked you to come in today.

04:53.814 --> 04:55.681
It's not? No.

04:55.706 --> 04:58.353
I'm afraid Lucy's gpa has fallen to a 2.8.

04:58.378 --> 04:59.104
What?

04:59.129 --> 05:01.367
Which puts her in danger
of losing her scholarship.

05:01.392 --> 05:03.092
But she's always gotten A's and B's.

05:03.117 --> 05:05.486
Not according to her
latest progress report,

05:05.511 --> 05:06.779
which you signed.

05:07.686 --> 05:10.020
[Sighs] This is not my signature.

05:12.151 --> 05:13.719
Then we have a much bigger problem.

05:13.744 --> 05:15.659
I get it. It's bad.

05:15.684 --> 05:16.909
But Lucy is a good girl

05:16.934 --> 05:19.835
who is just going
through a very tough time.

05:21.623 --> 05:23.921
- Do you watch the news?
- I do.

05:23.947 --> 05:26.110
Catch the story about the
guy who faked his own death

05:26.134 --> 05:27.367
then was murdered by a drug lord?

05:27.392 --> 05:28.882
- Florida man?
- Yep.

05:28.908 --> 05:30.766
That was Lucy's father.

05:30.790 --> 05:31.640
Oh.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.965
Yeah.

05:33.165 --> 05:35.109
I'm so sorry.

05:35.134 --> 05:38.297
She lost him once, then learned
he was alive the whole time,

05:38.322 --> 05:39.755
only to lose him again.

05:41.015 --> 05:43.148
Well, I will cut her some slack.

05:43.173 --> 05:45.073
[Exhales deeply] Thank you.

05:45.098 --> 05:47.812
And she will get it from
me about the signature.

05:47.837 --> 05:48.476
Uh, just a sec.

05:48.501 --> 05:49.960
Have you considered sending Lucy

05:49.986 --> 05:53.122
to this weekend's life skills
camping trip at big bear?

05:54.144 --> 05:55.906
She didn't give you the pamphlet.

05:55.931 --> 05:57.937
Clearly, I have to start
checking her backpack.

05:57.962 --> 06:00.110
It's a character-building program.

06:00.135 --> 06:02.328
I find that all kids,
especially those going off track,

06:02.353 --> 06:04.328
can benefit from challenging
outdoor activities.

06:04.353 --> 06:06.187
Lucy is not very outdoorsy.

06:06.212 --> 06:07.672
Oh, neither was my daughter.

06:07.705 --> 06:10.297
But when she hit a rough
patch during high school,

06:10.322 --> 06:11.997
my wife and I sent her.

06:13.266 --> 06:14.366
It was helpful.

06:14.391 --> 06:16.559
Yeah, I'll... Think about it.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.584
Good.

06:20.143 --> 06:21.677
Your résumé looks...

06:21.702 --> 06:22.625
It looks great.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.359
I can't believe you worked at The Tavern.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.320
How long were you in Sydney?

06:25.345 --> 06:26.445
Not nearly long enough.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.436

06:27.461 --> 06:28.297
Did I work with him?

06:28.322 --> 06:29.828
I was a groomsman in the guy's wedding.

06:29.853 --> 06:31.734
- I had known the dude three months.
- Well, he's crazy.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.672
We used to ditch school and surf all day.

06:34.697 --> 06:36.030
- Oh, you surf?
- Oh, yeah.

06:36.055 --> 06:37.656
We should uh...

06:38.387 --> 06:39.220
I was gonna say we should

06:39.245 --> 06:40.860
hit up the Venice breakwater some time,

06:40.884 --> 06:42.640
but then I remembered
this was a job interview.

06:42.665 --> 06:44.062
- So too soon.
- Yes, business.

06:44.087 --> 06:45.554

you make me a drink first.

08:29.277 --> 08:31.570

08:49.574 --> 08:54.022
I had just had my procedure.
He dropped by to check on me.

08:54.047 --> 08:55.946
And he stayed the whole day?

08:55.971 --> 08:59.146
The side effects hit me
harder than I expected.

08:59.313 --> 09:02.746
[Chuckles] And I-I was here alone.

09:02.825 --> 09:05.110
I didn't ask him to come.

09:05.135 --> 09:06.770
Yeah, I should go.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.180
Vivian...

09:08.205 --> 09:09.311
I can't be here.

09:09.570 --> 09:11.110
Vivian, please.

09:20.324 --> 09:22.023
I didn't ask him to come over

09:22.137 --> 09:24.374
or cancel his meetings...
<i>or</i> stay all day.

09:24.399 --> 09:26.701
So why do I feel like
I did something wrong?

09:26.936 --> 09:28.137
<i>Did</i> you do something wrong?

09:28.162 --> 09:30.237
No, not at all. It was perfectly chaste.

09:30.262 --> 09:31.737
"Perfectly chaste"?

09:31.762 --> 09:33.630
Was there physical contact?

09:33.655 --> 09:36.089
He took my pulse and held
my hair while I puked.

09:36.114 --> 09:38.037
Oh, both chaste and disgusting.

09:39.755 --> 09:40.688
What?

09:40.713 --> 09:41.512
It's just...

09:41.537 --> 09:43.436
Why wouldn't he have told Vivian?

09:43.461 --> 09:45.537
Because there was nothing to tell.

09:45.562 --> 09:47.496
Plus, he's not much of a talker...

09:47.599 --> 09:50.337
until he starts talk about
Vivian, then he lights up.

09:50.362 --> 09:53.457
I'm telling you, April,
this man loves his wife.

09:53.482 --> 09:55.090
Well, then don't worry,
they'll get through it.

09:55.115 --> 09:56.081
And what if they don't?

09:56.106 --> 09:56.926
What do you mean?

09:56.951 --> 09:58.985
[Sighs] What if this stupid day with me

09:59.010 --> 10:00.551
put a crack in their marriage?

10:00.576 --> 10:02.628
I've seen it with couples I've counseled.

10:02.653 --> 10:06.176
A hairline of mistrust
without immediate attention

10:06.201 --> 10:07.645
can become a real break.

10:07.669 --> 10:08.568
That would be a shame,

10:08.593 --> 10:10.660
but I don't see what you can do about it.

10:10.685 --> 10:11.652
I can fix it.

10:11.677 --> 10:12.972
Karen.

10:13.216 --> 10:15.172
I slept with Harry!

10:15.270 --> 10:16.971
Oh, my God!

10:16.996 --> 10:18.163
Congratulations?

10:18.188 --> 10:19.672
Are we happy?

10:19.697 --> 10:21.064
Yeah, we are.

10:21.089 --> 10:22.289
We don't look happy.

10:22.314 --> 10:23.848
No, no, no, we're thrilled.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.441
It was... it was good, it was amazing.

10:25.466 --> 10:29.129
It was the most connected,
passionate sex I have ever had.

10:29.154 --> 10:31.027
Our souls intertwining...

10:31.052 --> 10:33.026
at least I think it was our souls.

10:33.051 --> 10:34.073
Yeah.

10:34.098 --> 10:35.496
So what does this mean?

10:35.521 --> 10:37.402
Exactly. Exactly!

10:37.427 --> 10:38.434
You ask a fine question!

10:38.459 --> 10:40.133
What does it mean, April?

10:40.477 --> 10:41.879
I can't say that I know.

10:41.904 --> 10:43.571
[Chuckles] What does it mean to you, honey?

10:43.596 --> 10:44.801
It's it... I'm done.

10:44.826 --> 10:45.653
He's my guy.

10:45.677 --> 10:47.853
But I literally asked him where we stand,

10:47.878 --> 10:49.910
and he says, "we're happy."

10:49.935 --> 10:51.010
[Australian accent] We're happy.

10:51.035 --> 10:52.660
[Normal voice] What does happy mean?

10:52.685 --> 10:53.973
Since when is happy bad?

10:53.998 --> 10:55.293
It's not bad, Karen.

10:55.318 --> 10:56.895
You know, it's just... it isn't anything.

10:56.919 --> 10:58.499
We've been dancing around this for a year.

10:58.524 --> 11:00.840
He pulls this, like,
run out of "the graduate"

11:00.865 --> 11:02.565
to stop my wedding,
confesses his love to me,

11:02.590 --> 11:04.034
we finally do it, it exceeds expectations,

11:04.059 --> 11:05.987
and I ask him where we stand,

11:06.012 --> 11:07.986
and he says, "we're happy."

11:08.588 --> 11:10.354
He's having doubts.
That's what's happening.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.854
[Groans] I cannot believe
that he's having doubts.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.385
No, he's not! Hold on!

11:13.410 --> 11:14.346
You don't know that.

11:14.371 --> 11:16.479
Maybe he's just afraid to define it.

11:16.504 --> 11:17.760
Why would he be afraid?

11:17.785 --> 11:19.666
Because he doesn't want to scare you off.

11:19.691 --> 11:21.024
Sweetie, you have to admit,

11:21.049 --> 11:22.760
historically, you're
not the commitment type.

11:22.785 --> 11:24.860
And the last time you were pressured...

11:25.246 --> 11:26.494
I was a runaway bride.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.033
Harry's done the relationship thing

11:28.059 --> 11:31.234
where he was committed when
the other person wasn't.

11:31.438 --> 11:35.134
So he just needs a
little bit of reassurance.

11:35.823 --> 11:37.091
Okay.

11:37.116 --> 11:38.433
Okay, I can do that.

11:39.906 --> 11:40.873
Mmm!

11:40.898 --> 11:41.994
Sorry.

11:42.019 --> 11:43.219
What's happening with you guys?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.666
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

11:46.053 --> 11:48.135
So, I signed it. So what?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.190
Lucy, you know that was wrong.

11:50.215 --> 11:51.651
Fine, I know.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.280
Can I go to my room now?

11:53.305 --> 11:55.479
I just don't understand
why you didn't tell me.

11:55.504 --> 11:56.978
'Cause you would have gotten mad.

11:57.058 --> 11:59.705
I would have been concerned
and suggested a tutor.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.897
I don't need a tutor. I'm not stupid.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.713
Of course you're not. That's not what...

12:03.738 --> 12:06.353
Sorry if I got a few C's after
my dad died a second time.

12:06.378 --> 12:07.791
[Sighs]

12:07.816 --> 12:09.911
Okay, you're right.

12:10.114 --> 12:12.049
You have been dealing with way too much,

12:12.074 --> 12:13.666
which is what I told Headmaster Patterson,

12:13.691 --> 12:14.416
and he's gonna...

12:14.441 --> 12:16.011
Did you tell him about dad?

12:16.523 --> 12:18.363
Why does everyone have
to know? [Door opens]

12:18.388 --> 12:20.324
He's not gonna say anything, honey.

12:20.349 --> 12:21.222
I thought it would help.

12:21.247 --> 12:23.521
[Door closes] Stop trying to help
me. You make everything worse.

12:24.630 --> 12:26.821
[Sighs]

12:28.590 --> 12:29.521
Got the job.

12:29.546 --> 12:30.886
[Exhales sharply]

12:30.911 --> 12:32.412
I liked Harry.

12:33.650 --> 12:35.516
We can talk about it later.

12:38.199 --> 12:40.030
Okay, so I confirmed the Roosevelt

12:40.055 --> 12:41.489
for your editor's luncheon next week,

12:41.514 --> 12:43.366
and they suggested hydrangea centerpieces,

12:43.391 --> 12:45.374
but I told them burgundy calla lilies

12:45.399 --> 12:46.741
to complement the new line.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.540
I can't.

12:47.565 --> 12:48.441
Mmm.

12:48.553 --> 12:50.132
We can to do the hydrangeas.

12:50.157 --> 12:51.557
No, it's...

12:51.582 --> 12:53.231
It's Luca.

12:53.256 --> 12:55.085
Oh, no. Okay.

12:55.110 --> 12:56.554
What did he do now?

12:56.579 --> 12:58.093
He invited me to dinner.

12:58.118 --> 12:59.718
[Chuckles]

13:00.123 --> 13:02.991
It's our 10-year anniversary today.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.991
Well, I would say
congratulations, but we hate him.

13:07.066 --> 13:08.991
We don't hate him.

13:09.177 --> 13:11.593
Oh, okay. You're not
considering going, are you?

13:11.618 --> 13:12.952
He just cheated on you with twiggy.

13:12.977 --> 13:14.077
Or did he?

13:14.102 --> 13:15.812
Or am... or am I just...

13:15.836 --> 13:16.942
and I paranoid?

13:16.967 --> 13:19.890
Calista, do you really think
that you are being paranoid?

13:19.915 --> 13:21.609
I don't know. I don't know anymore.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.092
He's screwed me over
so many freaking times,

13:24.118 --> 13:25.937
that's just what I go to at this point.

13:25.961 --> 13:27.819
- I feel crazy.
- Stop, okay.

13:27.844 --> 13:30.413
Look [Chuckles] it doesn't matter.

13:30.438 --> 13:32.976
Even if he didn't sleep with
Eva whatever her name is,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.194
he's still a lying bastard

13:34.219 --> 13:36.493
who you're planning to punish
with a crushing divorce.

13:36.518 --> 13:38.788
Hey, don't forget how I
met you, lady long lens.

13:38.813 --> 13:39.983
I know, I know.

13:40.008 --> 13:42.743
So, why would you consider going to dinner?

13:42.768 --> 13:45.100
Because it's my marriage, Joss.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.679
It's a marriage, it's a...

13:46.704 --> 13:49.573
it's... it's... it's a decade of history.

13:49.598 --> 13:51.399
And it wasn't all bad.

13:51.424 --> 13:54.257
- Mmm.
- Ss-s-sort of bad.

13:54.282 --> 13:58.057
I mean, the first two
years were magic, seriously.

13:58.082 --> 14:00.522
He loved me when I had frizzy hair,

14:00.547 --> 14:02.218
sewing like a maniac

14:02.243 --> 14:04.929
in my parents' basement in Queens.

14:05.469 --> 14:09.238
He went out and stole a car and hocked it

14:09.263 --> 14:11.310
and put the seed money towards the company.

14:11.335 --> 14:14.662
I mean, we were two scrappy, hungry kids

14:14.687 --> 14:17.256
so desperate to make
something out of ourselves

14:17.281 --> 14:19.108
when everyone said that we wouldn't.

14:19.132 --> 14:21.100
And to their surprise, we did,

14:21.125 --> 14:22.906
and we built a freaking empire.

14:23.373 --> 14:25.041
I get it.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.332
But, Calista, do you still love him?

14:27.357 --> 14:28.906
I didn't think I did.

14:28.931 --> 14:32.233
But now...

14:32.258 --> 14:33.525
I don't know.

14:33.550 --> 14:36.409
Crazier than that, Joss, I think...

14:37.081 --> 14:40.050
He... he may still love me.

14:42.810 --> 14:44.810
Okay. Mmm, mmm.

14:44.835 --> 14:48.071
So, what are we wearing to this dinner?

14:50.392 --> 14:52.581
Vivian, it's Karen again.

14:52.606 --> 14:54.907
I'd really like to clear the air.

14:54.932 --> 14:57.033
Please call me back.

15:00.831 --> 15:02.665
Karen.

15:03.255 --> 15:05.056
Alec, hi.

15:05.081 --> 15:06.148
So, you're back at work.

15:06.184 --> 15:07.517
Yes, indeed.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.962
Good.

15:09.079 --> 15:11.661
Hey, you have a, uh...

15:14.079 --> 15:15.395
Lint.

15:15.420 --> 15:17.589
Thank you.

15:18.034 --> 15:21.136
Anyway, I'm glad you're feeling better.

15:22.074 --> 15:23.608
You look good.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.101
Thanks.

15:30.686 --> 15:32.920
[Sighs]

15:33.399 --> 15:34.960
Our bourbon and ginger is a big seller.

15:34.985 --> 15:36.381
So is our coconut mojito.

15:36.406 --> 15:37.904
[Scoffs] 18 bucks each.

15:37.929 --> 15:39.271
What, do they come with a lap dance?

15:39.296 --> 15:40.463
[Chuckles]

15:40.488 --> 15:42.623
You're not a warm person, are you?

15:42.648 --> 15:44.081
Uh, we're not open yet.

15:44.106 --> 15:45.940
Oh, I'm here to see Harry.

15:45.965 --> 15:48.092
Davis, girl here!

15:48.117 --> 15:49.694
- "Girl here"?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

15:49.719 --> 15:50.545
Hey.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.975
- Hi.
- You're here.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.001
Yeah. I just thought
I'd pop in and see you.

15:54.026 --> 15:55.541
Oh, just in time for some nosh.

15:55.566 --> 15:56.373
Look at that.

15:56.398 --> 15:57.398
That looks good.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.209
Mmm, so do you.

15:58.234 --> 16:00.509
[Chuckles]

16:03.184 --> 16:04.934
Uh...

16:04.959 --> 16:07.193
Oh, have you met Marc?

16:07.219 --> 16:08.600
[Giggles] Hi, Marc.

16:08.625 --> 16:09.303
Hi.

16:09.328 --> 16:11.491
Oh! Wait. Uncle Marc.

16:11.516 --> 16:12.585
Well, yeah.

16:12.609 --> 16:14.044
I've heard so much about you.

16:14.069 --> 16:15.357
It's great to meet you.

16:15.383 --> 16:16.350
[Laughs] Nice to meet you.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.850
Can I get you lovebirds something to drink?

16:17.968 --> 16:20.287
Sure. Two glasses of our domaine Syrah.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.311
Thanks, mate.

16:21.336 --> 16:22.512
Uh-huh.

16:22.688 --> 16:24.923
Aww. I like him. He's cute.

16:24.948 --> 16:25.812
Easy.

16:25.837 --> 16:27.350
Oh, but you're hot.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.397
- Oh, yeah?
- Very hot.

16:28.422 --> 16:29.506
You like me, then?

16:29.531 --> 16:30.850
- [Chuckles] I love you.
- I love <i>you.</i>

16:30.875 --> 16:31.841
You do?

16:31.866 --> 16:33.201
- [Chuckles]
- [Giggles]

16:33.226 --> 16:34.994
Mm.

16:35.019 --> 16:36.592
I wish I didn't have to work today.

16:36.617 --> 16:39.803
Oh, well, I can come by
your place later tonight.

16:39.828 --> 16:41.944
You could, but I won't be
home until about 2:00 A.M.

16:41.969 --> 16:42.585
Oh.

16:42.609 --> 16:43.483
How about, uh...

16:43.805 --> 16:45.623
How about brunch in bed tomorrow?

16:45.648 --> 16:46.920
Oh, my God, I wish!

16:46.945 --> 16:48.946
I'm... I'm... I'm organizing
this luncheon for Calista,

16:48.971 --> 16:50.045
but can we do it the next day?

16:50.070 --> 16:51.553
Thank you. Thanks, mate.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.366
Uh, the next day, I'm supposed
to be looking at houses.

16:54.391 --> 16:55.132
Wait, houses?

16:55.156 --> 16:57.091
Yeah, I feel like it's time for an upgrade.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.883
But you know what? I can look another day.

16:58.908 --> 17:01.631
I'd much rather spend time with you.

17:02.803 --> 17:04.336
Or...

17:04.361 --> 17:06.248
I could look at houses with you.

17:06.882 --> 17:08.683
Really?

17:08.708 --> 17:10.037
I know a lot about them.

17:10.061 --> 17:11.357
- Houses.
- Yeah.

17:11.383 --> 17:12.717
Even though you don't have one.

17:12.742 --> 17:15.715
Well, I don't have one yet.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.483
You... are you saying...

17:18.508 --> 17:19.482
I don't know. It's just a thought.

17:19.507 --> 17:21.616
- You and I should...
- Mm.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.608
No, or do you think it's too soon?

17:23.633 --> 17:24.999
[Inhales sharply] Are you kidding?

17:25.023 --> 17:25.935
It's not possible.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.013
- So it's a yeah?
- Yeah.

17:27.039 --> 17:28.006
Oh!

17:28.031 --> 17:29.932
Oh.

17:29.957 --> 17:31.772
- Oh!
- Come here.

17:33.642 --> 17:37.511
[Birds chirping]

17:37.536 --> 17:39.264
[Doorbell rings]

17:43.691 --> 17:46.118
I'm not having an affair with your husband.

17:46.143 --> 17:47.569
I know you're not.

17:47.594 --> 17:48.861
Come in.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.562
[Sighs] I'm sorry.

17:54.587 --> 17:55.854
Why are <i>you</i> sorry?

17:55.879 --> 17:57.780
Because you've been nothing but selfless,

17:57.805 --> 18:00.340
and I acted like a lunatic
showing up at your place.

18:00.365 --> 18:01.452
It's fine.

18:01.477 --> 18:03.249
- I'm embarrassed.
- Don't be.

18:03.274 --> 18:05.548
I should have just asked
Alec where he was that day,

18:05.573 --> 18:07.593
which I finally did, by the way,

18:07.618 --> 18:09.585
and he told me straight
out he was with you.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.133
He said he didn't mention it

18:11.158 --> 18:13.324
because he knew I wouldn't
have wanted him to bother you.

18:13.349 --> 18:14.483
It wasn't a bother.

18:14.508 --> 18:16.676
I actually needed some looking after.

18:16.701 --> 18:17.921
I didn't think I would, but...

18:17.946 --> 18:19.499
You doctors just kill me.

18:19.524 --> 18:21.351
You'd jump into a pot of boiling oil

18:21.376 --> 18:22.942
before admitting you need help.

18:23.653 --> 18:25.319
I'll work on that.

18:25.344 --> 18:26.616
Should we sit?

18:26.640 --> 18:27.815
Sure.

18:34.686 --> 18:37.116
Look, it's none of my business

18:37.141 --> 18:40.415
but why were you so quick to
think Alec was cheating on you?

18:40.440 --> 18:42.372
He's not the type, I know.

18:42.397 --> 18:44.371
It's just... [Inhales deeply]

18:44.396 --> 18:46.772
How do I say this?

18:46.797 --> 18:49.772
Alec and I don't have sex.

18:49.797 --> 18:50.972
Oh.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.397
Yeah.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.790
Since when?

18:53.815 --> 18:55.772
Since my diagnosis.

18:55.797 --> 18:57.272
Three years ago?

18:57.297 --> 19:00.215
Well, it started as an off-and-on thing,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.673
but this past year...

19:01.698 --> 19:02.567
Mostly off?

19:02.592 --> 19:03.525
Like a light.

19:03.694 --> 19:06.429
[Sighs] And what do you think that's about?

19:07.597 --> 19:11.196
I think he sees me as a patient now.

19:11.264 --> 19:13.632
You know, someone to dote on and tend to...

19:13.657 --> 19:17.059
this porcelain thing
that he's afraid to break.

19:18.072 --> 19:21.754
It's like he's forgotten
how to see me that way.

19:21.779 --> 19:23.547
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:23.572 --> 19:26.606
And how is this for cruel
irony? We used to be rabbits.

19:26.631 --> 19:29.006
It was one of the reasons
we waited to have kids.

19:29.031 --> 19:32.379
Sex was... was so much a
part of who we were together.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.238
We didn't want to mess it up.

19:34.263 --> 19:37.609
Then I got sick and everything shifted.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.294
But now you feel better.

19:39.319 --> 19:42.652
I have tried, but... [Scoffs]

19:42.676 --> 19:44.786
Alec doesn't respond.

19:44.811 --> 19:46.356
Have you thought about counseling?

19:46.381 --> 19:48.387
Oh, the last thing that
Alec wants to talk about

19:48.412 --> 19:49.787
is our sex lives.

19:49.812 --> 19:52.192
I mean, he can barely talk about lunch

19:52.217 --> 19:54.351
without breaking into hives.

19:54.376 --> 19:56.416
You and Alec love each other.

19:56.441 --> 19:57.616
It's so clear.

19:57.641 --> 20:02.116
I've seen it. I've felt it.
The ember's still strong.

20:02.648 --> 20:05.450
If Alec is resistant to therapy,

20:05.554 --> 20:08.116
then you'll just have
to find a creative way

20:08.141 --> 20:09.916
to fan the old flames.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.643
Creative, how?

20:14.891 --> 20:16.526
Karen?

20:19.204 --> 20:21.272
- [Cellphone rings]
- Hello?

20:21.297 --> 20:23.577
Mr. Davis, this is your realtor calling.

20:23.861 --> 20:25.889
Mm, my realtor sounds very sexy.

20:25.914 --> 20:26.947
[Chuckles]

20:26.972 --> 20:29.006
What's sexy is this house
that I just found us.

20:29.031 --> 20:29.662
Listen to this...

20:29.687 --> 20:31.631
Fryman Canyon, three bed, two bath,

20:31.656 --> 20:32.928
priced well below value.

20:32.953 --> 20:34.584
The caravan's in two
days, but I can get us in

20:34.609 --> 20:36.053
tomorrow at 4:00.

20:36.078 --> 20:37.170
I...

20:37.195 --> 20:39.412
No, I can't tomorrow at 4:00, babe.

20:39.437 --> 20:40.341
We're booked solid,

20:40.366 --> 20:41.592
and I'm trying out a whole new menu.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.483
Babe, I'm sure that your minions

20:43.508 --> 20:44.960
can handle the kitchen for an hour.

20:44.984 --> 20:46.384
We'll be fast, in and out, I promise.

20:46.409 --> 20:48.803
I just... I have a really
good feeling about this

20:48.828 --> 20:51.201
and I called in a favor
with the agent, so...

20:51.226 --> 20:53.420
[Sighs] Can you do 3:00?

20:53.445 --> 20:54.779
Mm-hmm.

20:54.804 --> 20:56.978
Texting you the address now.

20:57.003 --> 20:59.379
[Cellphone chimes]

21:02.720 --> 21:04.324
Let's go!

21:04.349 --> 21:06.660
We don't eat dinner until
all these tents are all up.

21:06.685 --> 21:07.860
All right?

21:07.885 --> 21:09.019
Lucy.

21:09.044 --> 21:11.460
Lucy!

21:13.724 --> 21:16.097
- Lucy!
- What?

21:16.122 --> 21:17.730
Can you please help me here?

21:17.755 --> 21:20.190
[Sighs] You wanted to come
here, you pitch the tent.

21:20.215 --> 21:22.746
I wanted to come here so we
could spend time together.

21:22.771 --> 21:24.386
This is not spending time.

21:24.411 --> 21:26.478
You wanted to come here to punish me.

21:26.682 --> 21:28.702
Please give me that makeup.

21:28.727 --> 21:29.699
No.

21:29.724 --> 21:30.815
Yes!

21:30.840 --> 21:32.084
Come and get it.

21:32.896 --> 21:34.263
You...

21:34.288 --> 21:35.211
[sighs]

21:35.236 --> 21:37.911
Yeah, I didn't think so.

21:37.936 --> 21:40.438
I'm going to Emma's tent.

21:43.314 --> 21:44.707
Everything okay?

21:44.732 --> 21:48.701
Oh, yeah, she's just, uh,
still adjusting to the altitude.

21:48.726 --> 21:50.027
If you need any help.

21:50.052 --> 21:50.943
Oh, I got this.

21:50.979 --> 21:53.447
Okay.

21:53.934 --> 21:56.044
[Grunting]

21:59.026 --> 22:01.143
[Sighs]

22:04.007 --> 22:05.643
[Sighs]

22:05.668 --> 22:07.672
[Laughter]

22:09.002 --> 22:10.402
Wait, wait. What was her name again?

22:10.427 --> 22:13.105
What? Come on! Pia Conti.

22:13.130 --> 22:14.730
- Right.
- [Chuckles]

22:14.755 --> 22:16.332
Every time she'd piss us off, we'd go,

22:16.357 --> 22:17.757
both: "Don't Pia Conti."

22:17.782 --> 22:19.516
[Laughs]

22:19.541 --> 22:21.458
God, I love your laugh.

22:21.483 --> 22:23.074
Oh, come on.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.241
- More champagne?
- Mnhmnh.

22:26.267 --> 22:27.278
Give it to me.

22:27.303 --> 22:28.817
- No, I'm good. Oh.
- We're celebrating.

22:28.842 --> 22:29.864
No, in a minute. All right.

22:29.889 --> 22:31.684
Come on, where's my good-time girl?

22:31.710 --> 22:32.505
- Luca.
- Hmm?

22:32.530 --> 22:33.232
Don't Pia Conti.

22:33.257 --> 22:35.810
- Oh!
- [Laughs]

22:37.799 --> 22:39.864
[Breathes deeply]

22:39.889 --> 22:41.690
[Sighs]

22:41.715 --> 22:43.048
Hmm?

22:43.276 --> 22:45.010
When is the last time we did this?

22:45.035 --> 22:47.536
Hmm? Dinner together?

22:47.561 --> 22:48.450
Mm.

22:48.475 --> 22:51.042
No buyers, clients...

22:51.128 --> 22:52.261
A year.

22:52.286 --> 22:53.667
2 1/2.

23:01.222 --> 23:03.591
I've missed it.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.409
- I'm just saying.
- Mmhmm.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.500
Well, I got something for you.

23:07.525 --> 23:09.125
No.

23:09.150 --> 23:12.219
What... I... I didn't get you anything.

23:12.243 --> 23:14.411
Hey, stop. You showed up.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.133
True.

23:17.250 --> 23:19.300
- Really?
- Mmhmm.

23:20.088 --> 23:21.722
Wow.

23:21.747 --> 23:23.297
[Gasps]

23:23.322 --> 23:26.063
Are you serious? This is stunning.

23:26.087 --> 23:26.804
You like it?

23:26.829 --> 23:30.101
Like it?! I love it! It's... it's crazy!

23:30.126 --> 23:31.781
The artistry is amazing.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.705
Who... who designed this?

23:34.730 --> 23:35.765
I did.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.703
- <i>You</i> did?
- Yeah.

23:37.728 --> 23:38.633
And I got more.

23:38.657 --> 23:40.957
It's part of a side project
I've been working on.

23:40.982 --> 23:42.339
I got nine pieces.

23:42.364 --> 23:45.092
Bracelets, earrings, cufflinks for men.

23:45.117 --> 23:46.291
So this...

23:46.316 --> 23:48.392
Is a logo I roughed out.

23:49.549 --> 23:51.586
And here are the designs.

23:51.611 --> 23:53.469
Modern, yet timeless.

23:53.493 --> 23:55.234
Everything in line with our brand.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.250
I sourced the gemstones in Namibia,

23:57.275 --> 23:59.349
conflict-free, of course.

24:01.632 --> 24:03.800
- Hey.
- [Knocks on table]

24:03.825 --> 24:05.297
What's wrong?

24:05.322 --> 24:07.856
I'm so stupid.

24:07.881 --> 24:08.992
What?

24:09.017 --> 24:11.430
This is not about our anniversary.

24:11.454 --> 24:13.038
This is about business.

24:13.064 --> 24:16.984
It's about you bringing me
here, soften me up, get me drunk,

24:17.009 --> 24:20.179
and then I would just sign
off on your jewelry line

24:20.204 --> 24:21.495
under my brand?

24:21.520 --> 24:23.039
- Come on.
- Right.

24:23.064 --> 24:24.820
Hey, sit down. Come on. Sit down.

24:24.845 --> 24:27.179
No, no, no, no. Really,
aa jewelry line, Luca?

24:27.204 --> 24:28.304
This was a present.

24:28.329 --> 24:29.546
- Oh, was it?
- Yeah.

24:29.571 --> 24:31.250
Well, this is my present.

24:31.394 --> 24:36.167
You're a selfish bastard.
Do not follow me home.

24:37.821 --> 24:39.467
[Sniffs]

24:42.300 --> 24:45.314
Lucy, you ready to go to the canteen?

24:52.664 --> 24:54.880
Hey, Sarah, have you seen Lucy?

24:54.905 --> 24:57.278
She went with Counselor Lauren and
some other kids to gather firewood.

24:57.619 --> 24:59.983
She would literally do
anything to get away from me.

25:00.008 --> 25:01.175
I'm sorry?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.067
Nothing.

25:02.092 --> 25:04.398
Uh, do you know which trail she took?

25:05.776 --> 25:07.098
[Sighs]

25:08.481 --> 25:10.699
Lucy?!

25:12.921 --> 25:14.598
Hello!

25:18.538 --> 25:21.339
[Blair grunting]

25:26.156 --> 25:28.791
[Branch snaps] [Screams]

25:34.745 --> 25:36.079
Need a hand?

25:36.104 --> 25:39.589
[Chuckles] Yeah, sure.

25:39.614 --> 25:40.681
Oh!

25:40.706 --> 25:42.809
Was that realtor breathing
down our necks, or what?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.609
Nice poker face, by the way.

25:44.634 --> 25:46.168
You love the house, though, right?

25:46.193 --> 25:48.328
Mmm, wouldn't say love.

25:48.353 --> 25:50.687
Seriously? What is not to love?

25:50.712 --> 25:52.408
It had amazing bones, great light.

25:52.433 --> 25:54.300
You cannot beat that location or the price.

25:54.325 --> 25:55.708
You can beat that kitchen, though.

25:55.733 --> 25:58.093
Oh, come on. Every house has something.

25:58.118 --> 25:59.867
We'll just replace the cabs and counters.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.461
And the stove? And that sink?

26:02.486 --> 26:05.455
And... and... and plus
the layout is all wrong.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.983
But, Harry, everyone wants turnkey,

26:08.008 --> 26:10.046
but, you know, you pay
through the nose for it.

26:10.071 --> 26:11.984
Trust me, this house is a find.

26:12.008 --> 26:12.799
I don't know.

26:12.824 --> 26:14.444
We... we just started looking, all right?

26:14.469 --> 26:17.038
Yeah, but I don't want us to regret this.

26:17.063 --> 26:19.803
I mean, have an edge today,
but it's gone tomorrow.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.819
Well, maybe it's not meant to be.

26:26.194 --> 26:29.397
Hey, we'll find something. Don't worry.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.693
Well, the good news is I
don't think it's broken.

26:36.718 --> 26:37.825
[Scoffs] And the bad?

26:37.850 --> 26:39.622
No hiking for you tonight.

26:39.647 --> 26:41.738
[Laughs] I wasn't planning on it.

26:41.872 --> 26:44.468
I was actually looking for Lucy.

26:44.493 --> 26:46.793
She ditched me back at camp.

26:47.177 --> 26:49.494
I'm starting to think we
shouldn't have come here.

26:49.519 --> 26:50.886
Why did you?

26:51.053 --> 26:53.093
You said it would be good for her.

26:53.118 --> 26:54.638
As a personal growth opportunity,

26:54.663 --> 26:55.953
not a mother-daughter bonding trip.

26:55.978 --> 26:57.516
Oh, God. It's okay.

26:57.541 --> 27:00.079
I just... I... I thought
if I took her out here,

27:00.104 --> 27:02.306
maybe she'd let her guard down a little,

27:02.331 --> 27:03.719
stop seeing me as the enemy

27:03.744 --> 27:04.910
and start seeing me as her friend.

27:04.935 --> 27:07.610
I may be overstepping... feel
free to tell me to shut up...

27:07.635 --> 27:10.609
but I don't think Lucy needs
you to be her friend right now.

27:11.014 --> 27:12.520
Her reality was shattered,

27:12.545 --> 27:14.161
and she needs to know you're in control.

27:14.186 --> 27:16.177
She just pushes back so hard.

27:16.201 --> 27:18.153
Of course she does. She's a teenager.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.473
12. Don't you rush me.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.083
I get it. I do.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.231
Being a single parent ain't for sissies.

27:25.256 --> 27:27.799
My daughter's 18, and
it's still hard for me.

27:28.042 --> 27:30.199
I thought you were married.

27:30.224 --> 27:31.725
Widowed.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.199
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:33.224 --> 27:34.999
Yeah, five years ago.

27:35.679 --> 27:37.559
I know. It's a long time
to still wear the ring.

27:37.584 --> 27:40.475
[Sighs] I wore mine for a long time, too.

27:40.656 --> 27:42.575
It's hard to let go.

27:43.902 --> 27:44.868
Walk you back?

27:44.893 --> 27:46.160
Sure.

27:46.190 --> 27:48.124
[Groans]

27:48.149 --> 27:50.517
Oh, that's so great! You've made my day.

27:50.542 --> 27:53.814
Thanks! Great. Goodbye.

27:54.321 --> 27:55.856
You're in luck.

27:55.881 --> 27:57.882
Faith & Flower had a cancelation,

27:57.907 --> 28:01.051
so I just got you and Alec
a reservation for tonight.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.239
Now, how's the dress?

28:03.354 --> 28:05.152
Vivian: I'm not sure.

28:05.401 --> 28:08.344
Well, let's see. Don't be shy.

28:11.098 --> 28:12.866
Vivian!

28:12.891 --> 28:14.558
[Sighs] Really?

28:14.583 --> 28:15.851
You look stunning.

28:15.876 --> 28:18.611
Ohh. My arms.

28:18.636 --> 28:20.944
Nothing a little makeup can't fix.

28:20.969 --> 28:23.403
If this doesn't quicken Alec's pulse,

28:23.629 --> 28:25.397
then he might not be human.

28:25.422 --> 28:26.944
[Chuckles]

28:29.726 --> 28:31.127
What's wrong?

28:31.152 --> 28:33.844
I can't wear this. Could you undo me?

28:33.869 --> 28:35.404
Just... please.

28:35.429 --> 28:37.463
Yes, of course.

28:39.101 --> 28:41.701
Can you tell me what's going on?

28:41.726 --> 28:44.495
I feel fake, like I'm...

28:44.520 --> 28:47.864
- Wearing a costume.
- That is a dress you said

28:47.889 --> 28:49.356
you would have bought for yourself.

28:49.381 --> 28:52.883
Three years ago, maybe. [Groans]

28:52.908 --> 28:56.672
It isn't just that Alec doesn't
find me desirable anymore.

28:57.017 --> 28:59.317
<i>I</i> don't find me desirable anymore.

28:59.342 --> 29:01.090
You're just out of practice, that's all.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.081
[Sighs]

29:02.106 --> 29:03.606
Vivian...

29:03.843 --> 29:05.707
Look at me.

29:06.366 --> 29:09.235
You're the most vital woman I've ever met.

29:10.199 --> 29:13.207
That sexiness is still inside you.

29:13.232 --> 29:14.799
And we're going to bring it out

29:14.824 --> 29:17.293
so he won't be able to look away.

29:17.318 --> 29:19.207
[Sniffles] Okay.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.454
[Chuckles]

29:22.509 --> 29:24.907
Why are you helping me like this?

29:25.109 --> 29:26.583
What do you mean? I...

29:26.608 --> 29:28.743
Never mind. You know what?

29:28.768 --> 29:31.309
[Sniffles] I am gonna
need more than a dress

29:31.334 --> 29:33.020
to pull this thing off.

29:33.045 --> 29:34.934
Come back to my place?

29:35.247 --> 29:36.950
Sure.

29:41.066 --> 29:42.099
[Door closes]

29:45.336 --> 29:46.603
You packed my bags?

29:48.024 --> 29:49.925
I thought you would have cooled off by now.

29:50.117 --> 29:52.936
From, uh, now on, you could...

29:52.961 --> 29:55.936
Sleep wherever you slept last night, but...

29:56.682 --> 29:58.683
You can't live here anymore.

29:59.350 --> 30:02.237
Look, I'm sorry, Cal, okay?

30:02.477 --> 30:04.874
I thought that you might find the idea

30:04.899 --> 30:07.171
of an accessory line romantic.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.460
[Scoffs] You know, you
and I working together.

30:09.485 --> 30:12.944
[Sighs] It's such crap. Really.

30:12.970 --> 30:14.929
It has nothing to do with romance.

30:14.954 --> 30:18.400
It has to do with you wanting
a piece of the spotlight

30:18.425 --> 30:19.140
for yourself.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.023
No, I-I don't care about the spotlight.

30:21.048 --> 30:22.445
"Accessories by Luca."

30:22.470 --> 30:26.018
"Accessories by Luca."
Call it something else then!

30:26.847 --> 30:28.320
I'm going to bed.

30:28.345 --> 30:31.014
- Don't walk away from me. I'm trying to talk to you.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.038
Hey, Carla.

30:32.063 --> 30:34.064
Don't call me that.

30:34.089 --> 30:35.322
Carla, baby.

30:35.347 --> 30:37.428
That's not who I am anymore.

30:38.634 --> 30:40.128
I'm not letting her go.

30:40.153 --> 30:42.929
- [Sighs] Leave me alone.
- Because she's the girl who loves me.

Okay. [Coughs]

How much do you love this weed?

31:20.882 --> 31:22.484
It's a miracle.

31:22.509 --> 31:25.156
Medical-grade miracle.

31:25.181 --> 31:26.281
I can tell.

31:27.330 --> 31:31.875
An old love of mine was
sick, and he used it for pain.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.875
Well, we used it together.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.656
And then it was pleasure.

31:35.681 --> 31:38.672
Ohh. Alec won't smoke with me.

31:38.942 --> 31:41.094
I slipped him a pot cookie once,

and color-coded his ties.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.950
I'd like to start over.

36:22.158 --> 36:24.759
I thought we just did.

36:24.936 --> 36:26.536
Hmm.

36:30.882 --> 36:32.883
A shot of whiskey, please.

36:32.908 --> 36:33.874
[Glass thuds]

36:33.899 --> 36:35.032
Hey, how was that house?

36:35.397 --> 36:37.164
Better make it a double.

36:37.189 --> 36:38.396
- Bad, huh?
- Mm.

36:38.421 --> 36:40.488
One of those hillside ones on stilts, huh?

36:40.513 --> 36:42.517
[Chuckles]

36:42.542 --> 36:44.310
Nope, uh...

36:44.335 --> 36:46.717
Joss and I had a fight.

36:47.146 --> 36:49.717
She was emotional, and I was...

36:49.742 --> 36:50.917
I was kind of a jerk.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.476
Well, it's not over, though.

36:52.699 --> 36:55.417
Certainly not. But I've got to call her.

36:56.150 --> 36:59.544
Chef, uh, meat delivery.
They need you to sign for it.

36:59.569 --> 37:02.871
Meat? Right-o. I'll be right there.

37:03.264 --> 37:07.899
[Clicking]

37:10.981 --> 37:13.182
[Sighs]

37:14.549 --> 37:17.198
[Cellphone chimes, vibrates]

37:19.060 --> 37:20.293

[Sighs]

37:49.990 --> 37:52.691
[Blows]

37:52.716 --> 37:54.884
What did his text say?

37:54.909 --> 37:56.405
"Patient emergency."

37:56.430 --> 37:57.296
Oh.

37:57.321 --> 38:00.323
[Inhales deeply] He died, didn't he?

38:00.348 --> 38:01.922
That old love of yours.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.348
Tom.

38:04.373 --> 38:05.952
Yes, he did.

38:05.977 --> 38:09.087
Was he... The one?

38:09.112 --> 38:11.208
Well, he was married, but...

38:11.233 --> 38:12.066
Oh.

38:12.091 --> 38:15.223
As was the other great love of my life.

38:15.248 --> 38:18.824
Although with Peter, I didn't know.

38:18.849 --> 38:22.852
He was my cognitive-science
professor in college.

38:22.877 --> 38:25.445
God, I was so young.

38:25.470 --> 38:29.411
When I found out about
his wife, I was devastated.

38:29.436 --> 38:30.359
[Sighs]

38:30.384 --> 38:33.553
The fact that he let you
fall in love with him,

38:33.578 --> 38:35.336
it's just so wrong.

38:35.361 --> 38:38.051
Well, maybe he looked at me and saw,

38:38.076 --> 38:41.051
"oh, she's the mistress type."

38:41.199 --> 38:44.352
Just assumed I'd be capable.

38:45.195 --> 38:47.352
Turns out, I was.

38:50.715 --> 38:52.828
You're afraid that you're
attracted to my husband,

38:52.853 --> 38:53.820
aren't you?

38:54.215 --> 38:55.349
What?

38:56.422 --> 39:00.637
You're pushing us together
so you don't pull us apart.

39:02.541 --> 39:05.376
Oh, God.

39:07.173 --> 39:09.612
Something's wrong with me.

39:11.110 --> 39:12.043
[Laughs]

39:12.068 --> 39:13.812
[Voice breaking] I think I'm really broken.

39:13.837 --> 39:16.606
No. No.

39:17.026 --> 39:18.912
Listen to me.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.612
You're human.

39:21.637 --> 39:26.928
And you're beautiful, and
you are a truly good friend.

39:27.519 --> 39:31.839
And what is wrong with me that
you finding Alec attractive

39:31.864 --> 39:33.165
is kind of turning me on?

39:33.190 --> 39:37.827
I mean, really turning me on.

39:39.038 --> 39:42.007
