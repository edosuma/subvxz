Yeah, I'm sure, Ev. Dmitry's back.

00:06.715 --> 00:07.841
Do you really think
he had something to do

00:07.841 --> 00:09.468
- with Boris' death?
- I don't know,

00:09.468 --> 00:10.928

00:10.928 --> 00:12.513
How much longer will the E.R. be closed?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.056
A company called Symphony is negotiating

00:14.056 --> 00:15.474
to buy the hospital,

00:15.516 --> 00:16.808
but the regulatory approval
is taking forever.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.810
I wanted to give you this
as soon as possible.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.395
This is a cease and desist order.

You know, I think
this very exam might be

04:05.662 --> 04:07.915
a violation of our cease

04:07.915 --> 04:09.541
I wondered about that, so, um,

04:09.541 --> 04:11.168
I did some research.
The cease and desist

04:11.168 --> 04:14.546
pertains specifically
to commercial activities, so...

Since there's no monetary
exchange, there's no violation.

I have to say it...

07:47.301 --> 07:49.469

07:49.469 --> 07:50.804

07:50.804 --> 07:52.806
Good, good. Then you'll walk for me.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.308
Heel to toe, straight line. Go ahead.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.934
You think
I've been drinking and driving?

07:55.934 --> 07:58.729
Hey, show me you haven't.
Go ahead, walk.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.492

08:12.492 --> 08:14.995
Oh, yeah. I'm thrilled to be here.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.163
And judging from the skid marks,

08:16.163 --> 08:17.664
I'm gonna have to write you up
for speeding

08:17.664 --> 08:19.583
and breaking your curfew.
And as far as paying

08:19.583 --> 08:21.043
for the damages on the car?

08:21.043 --> 08:22.544
That's a whole separate conversation.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.004
I wasn't speeding!

08:24.004 --> 08:25.672
And I wouldn't have even been
slightly rushing

08:25.672 --> 08:27.382
if I didn't have that stupid curfew!

08:27.382 --> 08:28.884
You wouldn't have the stupid curfew

08:28.884 --> 08:32.179
if you hadn't failed algebra
and ended up in summer school.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.101
Okay, we'll discuss it at home. Come on.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.605
Listen, you should get her
checked out tonight

08:41.605 --> 08:43.315
by your family doctor.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.900
I mean, even though Molly
was wearing her seat belt

08:44.900 --> 08:48.779
and seems fine, that was quite
a tumble she took.

08:48.779 --> 08:51.615

08:54.117 --> 08:56.036

but my department's H.M.O.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.833

be grandfathered in

10:52.945 --> 10:54.279
to Shadow Pond's old zoning ordinances.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.822

10:55.822 --> 10:57.407

information in there

10:59.159 --> 11:00.536
You think I care

medical history right now?

11:01.870 --> 11:03.872
I'm trying to save Hankmed,
thank you very much.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.041
But if I could find that lease,

11:06.041 --> 11:09.461
then Blythe freakin' Ballard can go...

11:09.461 --> 11:11.588
cease and desist herself.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.257
Are you running again?

11:13.257 --> 11:16.301
Yeah, yeah. It feels great
to get back out there.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.719
You don't look great.

11:17.719 --> 11:21.807
Just... just don't overdo it, Henry, okay?

11:21.807 --> 11:23.225
You know, the hankies,

11:23.225 --> 11:24.560
they may be back doctoring
at Hamptons Heritage,

11:24.560 --> 11:25.894
but they're just a phone call away.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.021
Evan, stop it. I feel great, okay?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.940
Right. All right,
go clean yourself up, then.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.233
- Okay.
- Just hurry.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.651
Staff meeting starts in a few minutes.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.194
What? Staff meeting?

11:34.194 --> 11:36.822
Are you sure we can still
conduct business here?

11:36.822 --> 11:39.616
Well, we're not allowed
to treat patients here,

11:39.616 --> 11:41.743
but if that she-devil thinks
she can stop us from talking

11:41.743 --> 11:43.287
to one another in a free,
democratic society...

11:43.287 --> 11:44.705
What do the other neighbors

11:44.705 --> 11:46.623
think about Hankmed
seeing patients here?

11:46.623 --> 11:49.626
Um...

11:49.626 --> 11:51.128
we don't know any of our neighbors.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.672
Yeah, the closest one lives
in a different zip code.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.090
Then maybe you should get to know them.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.717
Let them get to know you.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.595
All right, we don't have time
for meet and greets right now.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.054
Come on, we're engaged in combat.

12:01.096 --> 12:04.892
So fight back...
But do it Hamptons style.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.185
Host an open house.

12:06.185 --> 12:09.062
A high society schmoozefest.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.940
- Get everyone else on our side.
- Exactly.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.151
New money settles problems with lawyers.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.820
Old money?
Settles problems with cocktails.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.950
Hmm.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.036
Ready? This is going to hurt a little.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.330
Have your way with me, honey.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.250
Oh.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.086
(Pop)
Oh! (Laughs)

12:33.086 --> 12:36.131
Ooh, well done, Ms. Katdare.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.800
I'm gonna take another X-ray
to make sure,

12:38.800 --> 12:41.595
but I think we got
your finger back in place.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.263
"We"? You did all the work.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.431
You did supply the finger.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.266
And the shame.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.060
For the amount of time
I spend in hotel rooms,

12:48.060 --> 12:50.354
it is mortifying
that I would leave my luggage

12:50.354 --> 12:53.857
in the middle of the room
and proceed to trip over them.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.235
On my rush to the bathroom, no less.

12:56.235 --> 12:59.279
I'm such a klutz, I would trip
over a cordless phone.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.697
Do you travel a lot?

13:00.697 --> 13:02.491
I'm on the road more than Willie Nelson.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.409
- Well, that's got to be tough.
- Oh, it's divine.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.704
The idea of being tied down
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.041
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.793
(Beep)

13:15.087 --> 13:16.797
You know, I have to admit

13:16.839 --> 13:20.092
I was a little skeptical
when you waltzed in here.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.468
I was expecting a doctor.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.095
Oh, Dr. Lawson was busy this morning.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.596
On the back nine?

13:24.596 --> 13:25.722
- No.
- Ah.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.808
Hank is not that type of doctor.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.601
He was with a patient

13:29.601 --> 13:31.520
when he heard you had a dislocation,

13:31.520 --> 13:33.689
and he didn't want you to wait
and suffer in pain.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.816
Oh, sounds like Dr. Lawson

13:35.858 --> 13:38.735
and Hankmed deserve
their sterling reputation.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.827
- Ms. Shackleford...
- Oh, Shelby, please.

13:46.869 --> 13:51.748
Shelby, I'd like to see you
again and do a head M.R.I.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.418
For a dislocated finger?
(Laughs)

13:54.418 --> 13:55.961
Are you trying to up my fee, or is there

13:55.961 --> 13:57.462
some anatomical secret I'm unaware of?

13:57.462 --> 14:01.842
Earlier, I saw an old bruise
on your arm.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.343
Did you have another fall recently?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.929
Oh, I am a magnificent klutz.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.640
You also have a slight tremor.

14:08.640 --> 14:12.352
Rushing to the bathroom could be
related to bladder issues,

14:12.394 --> 14:14.229
and with this cluster of symptoms,

14:14.229 --> 14:16.273
I'd feel more comfortable
ruling out other causes.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.567
- Like what?
- I would not want to speculate.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.943
Since it happens to be me

14:19.943 --> 14:21.361
you'd be speculating about, go for it.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.363
Okay.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.034
Do you know if there is any
history of M.S. in your family?

14:27.034 --> 14:29.369
I know for certain there is not.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.080
I am the first.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.542
You have M.S.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.794
Mm.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.216
Thanks for coming.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.759
As a doctor who makes house calls,

14:43.759 --> 14:46.094
I couldn't resist
my first houseboat call.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.554
How's Molly?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.932
She saw our family doctor
last night and got the A-okay,

14:49.932 --> 14:51.350
but I'm worried.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.768
She's been throwing up all day,

14:52.768 --> 14:55.938
and our doctor can't fit us in
before my shift starts.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.065
And I wasn't able to hit an atm,

14:58.065 --> 15:00.275
so I'm hoping that you'll...
you'll take a check?

15:00.275 --> 15:02.528
- Oh, not from you.
- Oh.

15:02.528 --> 15:03.946
Maybe the next time
my brother gets pulled over

15:03.946 --> 15:05.113
for tweeting while driving,

15:05.113 --> 15:06.823
you can lock him up
for a couple of weeks.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.909
(Grunts)
You okay?

15:08.909 --> 15:11.078
Yeah, it's nothing. I'm made of steel.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.204
Of course you are.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.164
Part of the job description.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.333
Thing is, every time I take an
X-ray of someone made of steel,

15:16.333 --> 15:17.626
I never see the steel.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.670
Look, I have these ulcers,

15:19.670 --> 15:22.673
but I take antacids,
and they do the trick, so...

15:22.673 --> 15:24.758
antacids aren't a treatment for ulcers.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.552
Maybe you want to get a blood
test, see what's going on.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.637
Thanks, but it's not me
you're here to see, so...

15:28.637 --> 15:31.139
and I'd like to keep it that way.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.391
(Sighs)

15:32.391 --> 15:33.684
Look, I'm happy to do the test,

15:33.684 --> 15:36.603
but if not me, I'm sure
your H.M.O. can handle it.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.730
How long ago were you diagnosed?

15:38.730 --> 15:41.149
Puberty?

15:41.149 --> 15:44.069
- Not mine, Molly's.
- Oh. (Chuckles)

15:44.069 --> 15:46.029
Hey, come on.

15:47.739 --> 15:51.493
So how many times did you throw up?

15:51.493 --> 15:52.578
Four or five.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.371
Four or five?

15:54.371 --> 15:56.874
Okay, grab your shoes.
We're going to the E.R.

15:56.874 --> 16:01.044
Um, you know what?
Maybe it was only three times.

16:01.044 --> 16:05.174
Okay, but five, four, three...
any vomiting after an accident

16:05.174 --> 16:06.842
like the one you had can be serious.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.510
I'm telling you, I feel fine, okay?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.429
It was probably something bad
that I ate.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.806
Right, or it could be

16:12.806 --> 16:15.350
a serious head injury
from flipping your car over.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.519
Molly, we can't take any chances, okay?

16:17.519 --> 16:19.855
Let's go. Grab your stuff.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.067
If if I tell you something...

16:24.067 --> 16:25.903
Does it stay here?

16:25.903 --> 16:28.155
If you mean will I tell
your dad, the answer's no.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.531
I won't break your confidentiality

16:29.531 --> 16:33.535
unless it's something life-threatening.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.370
That being said, he's your father,

16:35.370 --> 16:38.874
and I'm sure he'd want to know.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.417
Look me in the eye and promise.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.253
(Chuckles)

16:43.253 --> 16:44.755
I promise.

16:44.755 --> 16:48.467
I didn't throw up. Not once.

16:48.467 --> 16:51.428
I just didn't want to go
to summer school.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.182
Molly, if you don't want to go
to summer school,

16:55.182 --> 16:56.892
that's one thing.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.477
But fabricating a medical condition

16:58.477 --> 17:00.979
and lying to your father
about it isn't the answer.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.899
Unless you're trying
to make his ulcer worse.

17:03.899 --> 17:06.984
So now you're a family shrink?

17:06.984 --> 17:08.694
No.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.406
I'm a doctor who just had
his time wasted,

17:11.406 --> 17:12.824
and the man out there is a father

17:12.824 --> 17:15.786
who's worried his daughter
might have a serious injury.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.704
And you're a young lady who
seems too smart to have missed

17:17.704 --> 17:19.289
the big wake-up call
you should have gotten

17:19.289 --> 17:21.959
when you flipped your car over
last night.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.934
Dr. Matthews, call 316 please.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.061
Dr. Matthews, call 316.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.771
Dr. Lawson.

17:42.771 --> 17:43.939
Shelby Shackleford,

17:43.939 --> 17:45.774
V.P. of acquisitions
for Symphony Health.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.610
- Dr. Shackleford.
- Oh, call me Shelby.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.903
- Call me Hank.
- Thank you so much

17:49.903 --> 17:51.405
for coming in.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.240
Welcome to the brand-new
Hamptons Heritage.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.992
Thanks. It's nice to be back here.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.910
- Mm.
- What did you do to your hand?

17:56.910 --> 17:59.413
Oh, I tripped over a tumi.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.456
I thought it was serious
until your P.A. came in

18:01.456 --> 18:03.125
- and treated me.
- You're a client?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.293
Indeed.

18:04.293 --> 18:06.003
When a P.A. showed up
instead of a doctor,

18:06.003 --> 18:07.629
I thought I'd been sold
a bill of goods...

18:07.629 --> 18:09.131
(Laughs)
But Divya is amazing.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.465
She is, she is.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.508
And she did tell me about treating you,

18:11.508 --> 18:13.093
I just didn't realize you were you.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.470
- Oh, I am, in fact, me.
- Yes, you are.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.972
(Both laughing)

18:17.014 --> 18:19.183
You are a lifesaver for getting
this E.R. opened up again.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.767
Oh, it was our number one priority

18:20.767 --> 18:22.936
after we finished the deal
to acquire Hamptons Heritage.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.438
And you're renovating it.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.773
It's something we do with
all the hospitals we acquire.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.318
We believe that environment
plays a key role in health care.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.653
You should feel better the
second you walk into a hospital,

18:31.653 --> 18:34.489
but even more important
is upgrading the technology.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.824
You'll be amazed.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.410
Your labs will come back
to you lightning fast.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.413
We believe in a whole new way
of hospitaling... people first.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.081
- The way it should be.
- Mm-hmm.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.833
Well, Hankmed has enjoyed
a very good relationship

18:44.833 --> 18:46.168
with Hamptons Heritage,

18:46.168 --> 18:47.419
and we look forward to working with you.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.671
Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that.

18:49.671 --> 18:53.509
Hank, we want to open up
a concierge department here

18:53.509 --> 18:54.843
that treats people
in their homes like you do,

18:54.843 --> 18:56.595
but building that kind of business

18:56.595 --> 18:58.096
from scratch isn't easy.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.933
Like my mother used to say,
"sometimes the best biscuits"

19:00.933 --> 19:02.559
"are the ones already on the table."

19:02.559 --> 19:04.686
I'm from New Jersey, so biscuits...

19:04.686 --> 19:07.898
We want to buy Hankmed.

19:13.654 --> 19:16.907
- And that was their proposal.
- So wait.

19:16.907 --> 19:19.243
- Symphony wants to buy us out?
- Yes.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.829
Uh, no... sort of.
They want to partner with us

19:21.829 --> 19:24.206
and give us total autonomy
to continue to run Hankmed

19:24.206 --> 19:27.334
as we see fit, with an eye
to eventual expansion.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.836
Basically, we'd work hand in hand

19:28.836 --> 19:31.463
under their umbrella
as a major medical corporation.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.006
Did she mention a price?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.133
She didn't have a chance.
I told her we're not for sale.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.844
Right. It's nice to be wanted,

19:36.844 --> 19:39.596
but they're not Starbucks, and
we're not Seattle's best coffee.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.099
Or Diedrich's coffee. Or coffee people.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.642
- Or Tazo.
- Okay, we get it, honey.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.852
- Thank you.
- You get it.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.520
I did.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.272
- So we're all in agreement?
- Yeah.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.356
Going once, going twice,

19:49.356 --> 19:52.317
- and not for...
- Actually, no.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.444
This might not be something
that we were expecting

19:54.444 --> 19:57.114
or planning...
Maybe even something we thought

19:57.114 --> 19:59.116
could never happen.

19:59.116 --> 20:03.078
But that doesn't make it
just go away, does it?

20:03.078 --> 20:05.455
We can close our eyes to it all we want,

20:05.455 --> 20:07.541
but it's still right there.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.043
It might not even be something
we want to deal with,

20:10.043 --> 20:12.045
but we have to, just because...

20:15.048 --> 20:18.093
well, we just do.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.345
- Oh.
- I agree.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.931
I don't think a proposal like this

20:22.931 --> 20:25.851
is something we should
just dismiss out of hand.

20:25.851 --> 20:29.855
Sometimes, big surprises need time

20:29.855 --> 20:32.024
to be properly digested.

20:32.024 --> 20:35.068
Life doesn't always go
according to plan.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.070
What's the harm in hearing more?

20:44.328 --> 20:47.080
- Sorry to bother you.
- No bother at all.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.834
Hey, is that Molly's mom?

20:50.834 --> 20:53.253
About all that's left of her, yeah.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.923
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, she's still alive.

20:55.923 --> 20:57.257
I mean, she...

20:57.257 --> 20:59.301
Cyndi had places she wanted to see

20:59.301 --> 21:02.930
and things she wanted to do,
so she took off to do 'em.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.432
(Clears throat)
Whoa.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.934
Where did you get that?

21:06.934 --> 21:08.310
Oh, it's a bullet I took
a few years back.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.394
But the pain...

21:09.394 --> 21:10.812
- the pain is nowhere near it.
- Okay.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.440
- Would you lie back, please?
- Yeah.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.069
I'm guessing you didn't see your doctor

21:17.069 --> 21:18.570
about the stomach pain.

21:18.612 --> 21:21.406
You know, it's kind of hard
to maintain a tough guy image

21:21.448 --> 21:23.033
when you complain of a tummy ache.

21:23.033 --> 21:26.912
They think you're getting soft
or old or both.

21:26.954 --> 21:28.330
I know the feeling.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.040
Doctors aren't allowed
to get sick either.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.124
Hmm.

Um, assuming that now that

22:00.362 --> 22:02.322
it's related to a gunshot wound,
the story is tough enough

32:52.014 --> 32:54.266
- Oh!
- All those antacids

32:54.266 --> 32:57.060
you were taking to treat
the ulcer you don't have?

32:57.060 --> 32:58.729
They helped build up
an excess of calcium,

32:58.729 --> 33:00.647
which led to hypercalcemia
and then this.

33:00.647 --> 33:01.815
- Oh!
- We're going to give you

33:01.815 --> 33:02.983
a mix of different medications

33:02.983 --> 33:04.651
that will help that tiny stone to pass,

33:04.651 --> 33:06.320
and hopefully the agony with it.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.572
Look, it... it's unbearable.
It's unbearable.

33:08.572 --> 33:09.990
Just give me anything.
Just make it stop.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.033
Please, make it stop.

33:11.033 --> 33:12.409
We will. We will, Don.

33:12.409 --> 33:13.744
Look, I know it hurts.

33:13.744 --> 33:14.995
They say the pain from a kidney stone

33:14.995 --> 33:16.705
is even worse than from childbirth.

33:16.705 --> 33:18.916
(Grunting)

33:22.753 --> 33:24.379
Some psychic she was.

33:24.379 --> 33:25.672
She could have just told me

33:25.672 --> 33:27.049
the party was gonna be a catastrophe.

33:27.049 --> 33:28.509
It went great.

33:28.509 --> 33:31.595
They only left so fast to
respect the patient's privacy.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.055
- Okay...
- Including Blythe.

33:33.055 --> 33:35.182
Paige, this... this is not the time

33:35.182 --> 33:37.684
- for your sunny optimism.
- Excuse me?

33:37.684 --> 33:40.687
Hankmed is screwed,
in case you didn't notice.

33:40.687 --> 33:42.064
We're screwed, Paige!

33:42.064 --> 33:43.232
They didn't even take the visors.

33:43.232 --> 33:45.025
They didn't take the DVDs.

33:45.025 --> 33:46.944
I'm calling my lawyer.
We tried it the Hamptons way.

33:46.944 --> 33:48.403
Now it's time to do it Jersey style.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.989
Evan, no!

33:50.989 --> 33:52.658
I know these kinds of people, okay?

33:52.658 --> 33:54.535
Dragging in lawyers
is only gonna make it worse.

33:54.535 --> 33:56.036
I tried to be polite. It didn't work.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.454
So now I'm gonna go
with my own instincts.

33:57.454 --> 34:00.874
You may know these people.
I know business.

34:00.874 --> 34:02.709
(Scoffs)

34:02.709 --> 34:05.295
I guess everything
isn't always perfect for you.

34:07.798 --> 34:11.552
About that... um, I want to apologize.

34:11.552 --> 34:14.721
No, I'm the one who should do that.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.389
I should never have snapped at you.

34:16.389 --> 34:19.226
- I was butting in.
- I was reeling.

34:19.268 --> 34:20.811
So I lashed out.

34:20.811 --> 34:24.063
With good reason.
You had really unexpected news.

34:24.106 --> 34:28.025
It's more than that.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.195
I was 12,

34:30.195 --> 34:34.074
and I was jumping my horse.

34:34.116 --> 34:36.534
We had a fall.

34:36.534 --> 34:39.538
I was in the hospital for weeks.

34:42.748 --> 34:46.420
My parents were told
that it was highly unlikely

34:46.420 --> 34:48.714
that I would ever have children.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.259
So that's how I've lived...

34:52.259 --> 34:55.929
believing that.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.054
But they were wrong.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.057
Yeah, apparently.

35:02.603 --> 35:06.398
Only now, um...

35:06.398 --> 35:09.359
I don't know how to feel about something

35:09.359 --> 35:12.237
that I never thought would happen.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.281
No wonder you need space.

35:14.281 --> 35:17.409
You were being a friend, okay?

35:17.409 --> 35:19.661
You are a friend.

35:19.661 --> 35:21.747
And I am sure that I am going
to talk your ear off

35:21.747 --> 35:25.042
once I get my head together.

35:27.169 --> 35:28.962
I'm so looking forward
to going down to Savannah

35:28.962 --> 35:33.550
and having some time to myself to...

35:33.550 --> 35:35.969
process it all.

35:35.969 --> 35:38.388
I'm here for you if you need me.

35:38.388 --> 35:40.891
Anytime, and in any way.

35:40.891 --> 35:43.977
But only if you ask.

35:43.977 --> 35:46.146
(Sighs)

35:46.146 --> 35:47.189
Aah, what the...

35:47.189 --> 35:48.315
what... oh, my bad.

35:48.315 --> 35:49.608
(Sighs)
Okay.

35:49.608 --> 35:53.529
And now it's red.

35:53.529 --> 35:55.531
- Good?
- Yeah.

35:55.531 --> 35:59.076
So, Henry, Char Margolis
was right on the money.

35:59.076 --> 36:02.830
The ghost of Boris has been
chatting up a storm.

36:02.830 --> 36:05.916
It's funny, Evan,
'cause I don't hear anything.

36:05.916 --> 36:09.503
Just wait. Wait.

36:09.503 --> 36:11.547
Am I allowed to talk?

36:11.547 --> 36:13.966
Or is it impolite
to interrupt Boris' ghost?

36:16.301 --> 36:19.471
Shelby got Dmitry's DNA results.

36:19.471 --> 36:21.598
Dmitry and Boris are half-brothers.

36:23.183 --> 36:25.310
Whoa. You were right.

36:25.310 --> 36:27.563
I know Boris knew
there was a side of his family

36:27.563 --> 36:29.356
that wasn't looking out
for his best interests,

36:29.398 --> 36:32.150
but I doubt he suspected
Dmitry was on that side.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.861
Oh, my God.

36:33.902 --> 36:34.945
We should have a seance.

36:34.945 --> 36:36.989
That way, we can just ask Boris.

36:36.989 --> 36:39.533
I talked to Char Margolis.
She said they're completely safe

36:39.575 --> 36:40.826
so long as you don't leave
the spirit circle.

36:40.826 --> 36:42.703
Enough, Evan. This is serious.

36:42.703 --> 36:45.581
(Muffled voice)

36:45.581 --> 36:48.375
So is that.
(Muffled voice)

36:48.417 --> 36:51.461
(Suspenseful music)

36:51.461 --> 36:53.046
♪ ♪

36:53.046 --> 36:56.300
(Muffled voice)

36:56.300 --> 36:58.260
Shh, shh, shh.

37:00.137 --> 37:02.931
(Muffled voice)

37:08.020 --> 37:10.063
Someone's in there.

37:10.063 --> 37:11.607
Or something.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.609
Okay.

37:15.235 --> 37:17.279
W... what...

37:17.279 --> 37:18.864
Okay, Henry. Hold on a second.

37:18.864 --> 37:22.201
Hold on, hold on. What are you gonna do?

37:22.201 --> 37:23.577
I'm opening the door.

37:23.619 --> 37:28.582
(Muffled voice continues)

37:28.582 --> 37:30.918
(Suspenseful music)

37:30.918 --> 37:36.882
(Boris speaking indistinctly)

37:41.094 --> 37:42.596
Udo?
(Click)

37:44.264 --> 37:45.641
What are you doing?

37:45.641 --> 37:48.769
I am erasing old security tapes.

37:48.810 --> 37:51.647
- Why are you doing that?
- I was instructed to.

37:51.647 --> 37:55.984
And I was ordered not to
watch them, which troubled me,

37:55.984 --> 37:57.611
because Mr. Kuester Von Jurgens-Ratenicz

37:57.611 --> 38:00.614
always had me review the tapes
before erasing them.

38:00.614 --> 38:02.282
So I've been doing it at night.

38:02.282 --> 38:03.659
Like, every night?

38:03.659 --> 38:04.952
Like, last night and the night before?

38:04.952 --> 38:06.912
Yeah.

38:10.374 --> 38:13.627
Udo...

38:13.627 --> 38:14.795
who instructed you to erase

38:14.795 --> 38:17.714
these tapes without watching them?

38:17.714 --> 38:19.758
Mr. Dmitry Vasilyev.

38:31.854 --> 38:33.939
So did you call Boris' medical proxy guy

38:33.939 --> 38:35.566
about your suspicions?

38:35.566 --> 38:37.151
His name is Milos.

38:37.151 --> 38:38.777
He's Boris' cousin.

38:38.777 --> 38:40.571
He seems really upset
about Boris' death,

38:40.571 --> 38:43.031
and he's equally suspicious.

38:43.031 --> 38:44.992
Did you ask if he knew
anything else about Dmitry?

38:44.992 --> 38:48.078
He didn't want to talk
any more about it on the phone.

38:48.078 --> 38:49.454
So when are you meeting up with him?

38:49.454 --> 38:51.373
He lives in Budapest.

38:51.373 --> 38:53.667
He wants to send his jet
to bring me there.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.711
Wait, you're going to Budapest?

38:55.711 --> 38:56.920
No, I don't have the time.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.213
And he seemed reluctant to come here,

38:58.255 --> 38:59.381
so I'm not sure

38:59.423 --> 39:01.008
- what happens next.
- Huh.

39:01.008 --> 39:03.427
So, Hank, I brought
my two-wheeled self-balancing

39:03.427 --> 39:05.929
personal transport specifically
to keep pace with you,

39:05.929 --> 39:07.598
and you're moving like an old lady.

39:07.598 --> 39:09.224
Okay, you were right!

39:09.224 --> 39:10.976
That run I took the other day was awful.

39:10.976 --> 39:12.436
It was almost as bad
as the one before it.

39:12.436 --> 39:13.896
I was sucking air the whole time.

39:13.896 --> 39:16.398
I just... I'm not good at pacing myself.

39:16.398 --> 39:20.319
All right, hold... hold up.

39:20.319 --> 39:23.822
You're out of shape,
and you're admitting it?

39:23.822 --> 39:27.534
Wow, I... those are two things
I never thought I'd live to see.

39:27.534 --> 39:30.078
Well done, Henry.

39:30.078 --> 39:32.789
I mean it. I'm... I'm proud of you.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.668
Thank you.

39:36.668 --> 39:39.046
See you later.

39:39.046 --> 39:40.214
No, you go ahead. It's okay.

39:40.214 --> 39:42.299
(Sighs)

39:44.009 --> 39:46.595
No, no! Not another open house.

39:46.595 --> 39:49.973
Nope. Thank-you gifts
from our neighbors.

39:49.973 --> 39:50.974
Seriously?

39:50.974 --> 39:52.184
Yep.

39:52.184 --> 39:54.436
As well as some signed retainers.

39:54.436 --> 39:55.521
What?

39:55.521 --> 39:56.939
They loved you guys.

39:56.939 --> 39:59.650
And seeing Hankmed
help a person in pain?

39:59.650 --> 40:02.110
Well, that just sealed the deal.

40:02.110 --> 40:03.695
They're willing to back us
on a zoning waiver.

40:03.695 --> 40:05.030
Not Blythe.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.366
But the overwhelming majority
should easily

40:07.366 --> 40:10.953
- convince the village council.
- Hank.

40:10.953 --> 40:13.038
At least, that's what
my instincts tell me.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.540
I'm sorry.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.500
And I totally trust your instincts.

40:20.379 --> 40:23.173
(Laughs)
Oh, my God!

40:23.173 --> 40:26.760
Oh, my God. Suck it, Blythe Ballard!

40:26.760 --> 40:29.513
Uh, she lives that way.

40:29.513 --> 40:30.597
- Suck...
- Evan.

40:30.597 --> 40:32.558
You're right. I'll save it.

40:32.558 --> 40:34.101
Save it.
(Laughs)

40:43.569 --> 40:45.529
Thanks for coming back.

40:45.529 --> 40:47.739
I wanted to get some more blood levels.

40:47.739 --> 40:49.741
- So soon?
- I'd like to test the levels

40:49.741 --> 40:51.994
every few days moving forward.

40:51.994 --> 40:55.372
Why?

40:55.372 --> 40:59.042
Your HCG levels have plateaued.

41:01.211 --> 41:03.213
May... may I?

41:08.010 --> 41:10.721
(Sighs)

41:10.721 --> 41:13.056
This pregnancy may not be viable.

41:15.434 --> 41:18.395
I'm so sorry, Divya.

41:20.939 --> 41:23.775
So Hankmed would operate independently?

41:23.775 --> 41:27.029
Yes, under the umbrella
of Symphony Health.

41:27.029 --> 41:28.447
I appreciate your telling me this.

41:28.447 --> 41:30.407
It makes me feel...

41:34.036 --> 41:35.370
Jeremiah, you're part of Hankmed.

41:35.370 --> 41:36.914
Of course we'd tell you.

41:36.914 --> 41:38.373
Not that we've made any decisions yet.

41:38.373 --> 41:40.459
We're still keeping
an open mind for now.

41:40.459 --> 41:41.877
Well, I'm happy to help

41:41.877 --> 41:43.879
- in any way.
- Thanks.

41:43.879 --> 41:45.297
I'll let you know
how the field trip goes.

41:45.297 --> 41:47.382
- Field trip?
- To one of their hospitals,

41:47.382 --> 41:50.552
to see firsthand how they do things.

41:50.552 --> 41:52.387
Would you want to go along?

41:52.429 --> 41:55.599
Uh, um... sounds like a terrific idea.

41:55.599 --> 41:57.059
Yeah, but it's down in Savannah.

41:57.059 --> 41:58.101
Is that okay?

41:58.101 --> 42:00.270
Uh, Georgia.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.356
I'm willing to travel...

42:02.356 --> 42:04.024
If it's for Hankmed.

42:04.024 --> 42:07.402
And in light of my newfound, uh, pluck.

42:07.402 --> 42:09.154
(Chuckles)
Great! It's this weekend.

42:09.154 --> 42:12.032
And it will be very helpful
to have a doctor there as well.

42:12.032 --> 42:13.951
- What about you?
- Oh, I'm not going.

42:13.951 --> 42:16.954
Just Divya... and now, you.
