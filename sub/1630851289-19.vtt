WEBVTT

00:21.877 --> 00:23.079
Gene, I already told you, hon,

00:23.113 --> 00:24.315
stop playing that game
at the table.

00:24.382 --> 00:26.185
Breakfast time is for eating

00:26.252 --> 00:28.490
and for talking to each other
about life and stuff.

00:28.591 --> 00:30.260
Oh, I thought it was
for watching Tina

00:30.327 --> 00:32.398
- dribble milk on her shirt.
- Huh? Oh, oops.

00:32.498 --> 00:34.068
Hold on, Mother.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.572
The temperature
in my game is dropping.

00:35.638 --> 00:38.043
I'm gonna put a scarf on Purrbo,
and then I'll put it down,

00:38.109 --> 00:39.178
I promise, I promise, I promise.

00:39.312 --> 00:40.515
Unless the weather changes again

00:40.582 --> 00:42.251
or I find the conversation unstimulating.

00:42.351 --> 00:44.021
Wait. What is this game again?

00:44.088 --> 00:46.459
- You dress a cat?
- Yes. It's called Purrbo.

00:46.492 --> 00:48.330
The weather on the screen
keeps changing,

00:48.396 --> 00:50.100
so you have to keep putting
different clothes on Purrbo.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.637
He got it at a yard sale
for a dollar.

00:51.737 --> 00:54.342
Apparently, these things were
all the rage ten years ago

00:54.375 --> 00:56.479
when there was maybe
nothing else to do.

00:56.547 --> 00:59.051
By the way, Gene, you still owe
me the dollar that you borrowed.

00:59.118 --> 01:01.222
- I gave you an IOU.
- Yep, yep, it's just

01:01.256 --> 01:03.159
that I have
a lot of them from you,

01:03.226 --> 01:05.063
and I'm worried
you and I don't think

01:05.130 --> 01:06.366
they mean the same thing. <i></i>

01:06.432 --> 01:08.069
Why does it keep
making that sound?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.007
Purrbo meows when he's
too cold or too hot,

01:10.073 --> 01:11.242
and you got to change him

01:11.342 --> 01:13.013
or he can freeze to death
or overheat.

01:13.079 --> 01:14.716
Oh. Like the dinosaurs.

01:14.816 --> 01:16.152
Or menopause, supposedly.

01:16.219 --> 01:17.555
Huh. So is that fun?

01:17.656 --> 01:19.225
I mean, it just sounds
kind of stressful.

01:19.325 --> 01:20.528
A thing that makes noises

01:20.628 --> 01:22.164
when it needs
something from you.

01:22.264 --> 01:23.768
I guess that's also
what kids are.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.836
- Father.
- It's true.

01:24.937 --> 01:26.272
Okay, okay, enough cat chat.

01:26.339 --> 01:28.009
Let's talk about something else.

01:28.143 --> 01:29.412
What are you guys
doing at school?

01:29.478 --> 01:30.949
That's what I'd like to know.

01:31.015 --> 01:32.151
What are we doing there?

01:32.251 --> 01:33.754
Seriously,
I don't get the concept.

01:33.854 --> 01:35.290
My chair is really squeaky.

01:35.357 --> 01:37.461
I've been getting a lot of
attention. I think I like it.

01:37.529 --> 01:39.165
I'm kind of the "it" girl
right now.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.202
Ooh. What about you,
Genie-weenie?

01:41.269 --> 01:43.173
Oh, I just remembered.
School gave me this.

01:43.239 --> 01:45.310
"Broccoli microgreen seeds."

01:45.377 --> 01:47.114
Is this the school
trying to give out

01:47.147 --> 01:48.718
weird healthy snacks
or something?

01:48.784 --> 01:50.020
Gross. I mean yum.

01:50.087 --> 01:51.456
No. They're seeds
for science class.

01:51.557 --> 01:53.493
- Huh. Can I see those?
- I think I'm supposed to

01:53.561 --> 01:56.199
plant them on a wet paper towel
so we can watch them grow

01:56.265 --> 01:57.502
inside our apartment
or something.

01:57.569 --> 01:59.238
Wow. Yeah.
That's what this says.

01:59.338 --> 02:00.575
You plant them
on a wet paper towel,

02:00.642 --> 02:02.177
and they sprout
within a few days.

02:02.311 --> 02:03.514
Gene, this looks... <i></i>

02:03.581 --> 02:05.818
Sunny again.
I'm feeling crop top.

02:05.885 --> 02:07.287
"Great," I was gonna say.

02:07.354 --> 02:08.490
The crop top? I know.

02:08.557 --> 02:10.027
Why aren't we all wearing them?

02:10.160 --> 02:11.964
Yep. Right.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.168
Hi, Teddy. You're here early.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.538
Yeah. I know you keep telling us

02:15.605 --> 02:17.308
it's annoying we're not
open for breakfast, but...

02:17.374 --> 02:19.445
It is annoying, but, guys,
I'm not here to eat.

02:19.546 --> 02:21.517
I need a favor.
I got a giant emergency.

02:21.583 --> 02:23.219
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, what happened?

02:23.286 --> 02:26.125
I ordered fresh-caught
wild salmon from Alaska.

02:26.192 --> 02:27.595
It was supposed to be
delivered yesterday,

02:27.696 --> 02:29.666
but shipping got delayed,
and I just got an email

02:29.733 --> 02:31.302
saying it's gonna be
delivered tomorrow.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.574
- Okay.
- But I'm leaving town today

02:33.641 --> 02:36.914
to take Mom to Senior Surf Camp
in North Carolina.

02:36.980 --> 02:38.450
Ooh, Senior Surf Camp.

02:38.517 --> 02:41.055
She's excited about it.
She keeps saying "tubular."

02:41.155 --> 02:43.360
I tried it, too.
I-I can't pull it off.

02:43.426 --> 02:45.263
Teddy, none of that
is an emergency.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.301
Bob, it's fish. It's perishable.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.571
If I miss the delivery,

02:48.637 --> 02:50.440
my salmon is gonna
sit in a warehouse

02:50.508 --> 02:52.478
somewhere at room temperature
and rot,

02:52.512 --> 02:54.716
which would be heartbreaking,
not to mention it wasn't cheap.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.720
Why did you buy it?
I mean, don't they sell

02:56.820 --> 02:58.924
the same Alaskan salmon
at the grocery store

02:59.025 --> 03:01.062
for the normal amount it costs?

03:01.129 --> 03:02.632
Eh, I bought it
a few nights ago.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.603
It was really late,
and I'd had some beer,

03:04.703 --> 03:07.074
and I was fighting with someone
from high school online,

03:07.141 --> 03:09.445
and I saw an ad of a guy
with a big beard

03:09.513 --> 03:12.151
wearing a fishing bib
and holding a big salmon.

03:12.217 --> 03:13.654
I wanted to be that guy, Bob,

03:13.754 --> 03:16.159
the guy who eats salmon
right out of the water.

03:16.225 --> 03:18.196
- Me, too, like a bear.
- So is it okay

03:18.263 --> 03:19.866
if I change the delivery address
to your place?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.237
And then you can put it
in your freezer till I get back?

03:22.371 --> 03:23.841
Guys, this is maybe
the most important thing

03:23.908 --> 03:25.210
I'm ever gonna ask you.

03:25.343 --> 03:27.247
I mean, you say that a lot.
Like when you asked

03:27.347 --> 03:29.351
if we thought you were
a baseball cap guy.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.456
It's no problem, Teddy.
Send it here.

03:31.523 --> 03:33.326
We'll make your fish wish
come true.

03:33.393 --> 03:34.796
Thank you, thank you.

03:34.863 --> 03:37.101
That's so tubular of you.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.269
- No, no.
- No, no.

03:38.336 --> 03:39.506
Oh, I know.

03:39.573 --> 03:41.275
Hey, you're home.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.647
I knew you'd come back,
my little boomerangs.

03:43.781 --> 03:46.520
Yeah, well, it's your reward
for feeding and sheltering us.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.490
Mm. Hey, Gene, I read about
your microgreens project.

03:48.557 --> 03:50.393
I mean, it seems
really interesting.

03:50.494 --> 03:52.699
You observe how they grow
and write it up in a report.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.538
And it says it's due
at the end of the week, so...

03:55.605 --> 03:57.408
End of the week?
That's like a month away.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.378
Gene, I think you should
start the seeds soon

03:59.478 --> 04:01.449
'cause, you know, they take
a few days to sprout.

04:01.550 --> 04:03.554
Like that one hair on Mom's
chin she always tweezes.

04:03.654 --> 04:05.691
- It's true.
- Also, the sooner you start 'em,

04:05.758 --> 04:07.762
the sooner we can watch
those little guys grow.

04:07.829 --> 04:09.766
Hold on, Dad. Snowstorm.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.438
Gene, can you maybe stop
playing that for a second?

04:12.539 --> 04:14.208
But Purrbo is chilly.

04:14.308 --> 04:16.145
And he looks good in everything.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.749
Oh, Teddy texted: "Don't forget,

04:17.816 --> 04:20.755
tomorrow 8:00 a. m. to 8:00 p.m.
That's the window."

04:20.855 --> 04:23.193
Are we getting a new window?
Ooh la la.

04:23.293 --> 04:24.495
No, no, a delivery window.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.232
Teddy's having
his salmon sent to us

04:26.332 --> 04:27.434
'cause he's out of town.

04:27.502 --> 04:29.171
Is this the kind
of fun adult stuff

04:29.238 --> 04:30.407
we have to look forward to?

04:30.474 --> 04:32.211
Well, you know,
you can also drink.

04:32.277 --> 04:33.581
- Drinking's pretty cool.
- Hmm.

04:33.681 --> 04:35.417
I mean, it's not cool.
It's not cool.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.720
<i>Lin, should we be worried</i>

04:36.787 --> 04:38.423
that our son is
obsessed with a game

04:38.524 --> 04:40.661
where you just dress a cat
and that's it?

04:40.728 --> 04:43.667
I don't think so. I mean, you
get obsessed with things, too.

04:43.734 --> 04:45.738
Remember when you got
really into soap carving?

04:45.805 --> 04:48.176
Every soap in our house was
shaped like a little duck.

04:48.243 --> 04:49.613
- Sort of.
- Yeah, but I get obsessed

04:49.679 --> 04:51.617
- with interesting things.
- Right, sure.

04:51.717 --> 04:53.186
You know what?
Maybe I could help Gene

04:53.286 --> 04:54.355
with his microgreens project.

04:54.421 --> 04:55.758
Show him how fun it can be.

04:55.858 --> 04:57.795
I mean, we could have
a mini farm in our apartment.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.267
Who wouldn't want
a mini farm in their apartment?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.505
Me. I don't want a bunch
of mini animals in here.

05:02.572 --> 05:04.441
- This place would stink.
- No, Lin, that's not...

05:04.543 --> 05:05.978
Anyway, my point is

05:06.045 --> 05:08.483
I think he's just too
distracted by that cat game.

05:08.584 --> 05:10.588
Oh, a mini tractor
could be fun, though.

05:10.688 --> 05:13.059
- Tiny little haystacks.
- Yep. Okay.

05:13.126 --> 05:14.696
Well, I'm gonna go get water.

05:14.763 --> 05:16.465
Oh, get me some, too.
And a little snack.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.635
- Maybe a cookie.
- Sure.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.205
- And some crackers.
- Really?

05:19.305 --> 05:21.209
Yeah. And cheese,
with the crackers.

05:21.275 --> 05:22.344
And arrange it a little bit.

05:22.477 --> 05:24.683
Gene, what are you doing
out of bed

05:24.783 --> 05:26.587
- with the laptop?
- Oh, hey, Dad.

05:26.653 --> 05:28.557
I'm just talking to some
people on a Purrbo forum.

05:28.657 --> 05:31.530
Okay. What people
are you talking to?

05:31.597 --> 05:34.268
Purrbo people, or "Purrbs,"
as they call themselves.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.470
- Which is delightful.
- Mm.

05:35.538 --> 05:36.707
Apparently,
there's a trick where,

05:36.773 --> 05:38.577
if you press both buttons
at the same time,

05:38.644 --> 05:40.447
Purrbo will cycle
through all the outfits

05:40.480 --> 05:42.084
you've ever changed him into.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.554
Wow, I-I did not know that.

05:43.621 --> 05:45.490
Hey, so I was thinking
I could help you

05:45.591 --> 05:47.327
with that microgreens
project for school.

05:47.361 --> 05:48.998
You know how to help
with school?

05:49.064 --> 05:50.601
I mean, no, not usually,

05:50.668 --> 05:53.039
but I feel like I can help
with this project.

05:53.139 --> 05:54.208
Okay. If you want to.

05:54.241 --> 05:55.511
So that sounds like fun, right?

05:55.578 --> 05:57.447
Doing this project together,

05:57.515 --> 05:59.653
learning about new,
interesting things

05:59.719 --> 06:04.563
instead of things that might
be making your brain bad?

06:04.663 --> 06:07.334
Gene, you're picturing me
as that cat, aren't you?

06:07.434 --> 06:08.971
No. Okay, a little.

06:13.046 --> 06:15.350
Morning, my little glories.
Wait. Is this breakfast?

06:15.417 --> 06:16.787
This is Gene's
microgreens project.

06:16.853 --> 06:19.291
Are we eating it?
- No, no. I'm making eggs.

06:19.391 --> 06:20.761
I'll never make you
eat vegetables

06:20.828 --> 06:22.665
- for breakfast, sweetie.
- I love you, Mom.

06:22.732 --> 06:24.636
So, Gene,
you want to get started

06:24.703 --> 06:26.607
on planting some seeds
and, you know,

06:26.673 --> 06:28.544
maybe put Purrbo down for a sec?

06:28.611 --> 06:30.146
- Uh-huh.
- Gene, seriously.

06:30.213 --> 06:31.683
Yep, yep. Okay. Putting it down.

06:31.817 --> 06:34.021
So, first, we take
two wet paper towels

06:34.088 --> 06:36.092
and put them on the bottom
of one of the trays.

06:36.192 --> 06:37.562
Quick outfit change

06:37.695 --> 06:39.431
for a rainy day, and go.

06:39.532 --> 06:40.968
Uh, and now we sprinkle
the seeds.

06:41.002 --> 06:42.639
Yeah. You want to just
start the sprinkling

06:42.705 --> 06:43.874
- and I'll catch up?
- Gene, come on.

06:43.941 --> 06:45.845
- This is the fun part.
- Obviously.

06:45.945 --> 06:48.550
All right. Sprinkle,
sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle.

06:48.617 --> 06:49.886
- Okay. Are we done?
- Almost.

06:49.953 --> 06:51.890
Uh, I'm just gonna spread
these out a little.

06:51.957 --> 06:54.696
Not that you didn't
sprinkle them really good.

06:54.729 --> 06:56.465
One more thing.
We have to put another tray

06:56.566 --> 06:58.369
on top of this one
to block out the light.

06:58.469 --> 07:00.340
It's called the blackout phase.

07:00.407 --> 07:02.244
It helps the microgreens
grow more long

07:02.344 --> 07:03.847
- and more tender.
- More tender?

07:03.981 --> 07:06.018
These microgreens sound like
great boyfriend material.

07:06.118 --> 07:08.456
You're not listening to any of this, are you, Gene?

07:08.557 --> 07:10.393
Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Here's breakfast.

07:10.460 --> 07:11.730
Bon appé-toot.
I'm gonna head downstairs

07:11.830 --> 07:13.466
and wait for Teddy's
salmon delivery.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.203
No one tell him
I was two minutes late.

07:15.270 --> 07:16.472
Delivery Teddy is
a little intense.

07:16.573 --> 07:18.242
Hmm.
- Oh, wait. I just remembered

07:18.309 --> 07:19.779
I was gonna go
to the store today

07:19.879 --> 07:22.518
and get a few things we need.
Uh, Louise and Tina,

07:22.619 --> 07:24.589
can you go pick up some stuff
for me after school?

07:24.656 --> 07:26.092
Gene, you should come home
and keep working

07:26.158 --> 07:28.296
on your cool mini-greens
project with your cool dad.

07:28.363 --> 07:30.300
- Uh-huh.
- Sure, we can go,

07:30.367 --> 07:31.536
but our rates have gone up

07:31.637 --> 07:32.839
since we last
ran errands for you.

07:32.905 --> 07:34.809
- You mean from zero?
- What you asking for?

07:34.876 --> 07:36.880
- We get some candy from the store.
- Okay.

07:36.947 --> 07:39.018
- Oh, me candy also.
- And we get to keep the change.

07:39.151 --> 07:41.623
Just the coins.
Paper money comes back to me.

07:41.657 --> 07:43.393
Hmm. We'll check out
our other offers

07:43.493 --> 07:44.696
- and let you know.
- Louise.

07:44.763 --> 07:46.700
- Fine, we'll go.
- Yay.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.737
I know Mom's expecting us
to bring back some bills,

07:48.871 --> 07:51.943
but it's not our fault they
gave us our change in all coins.

07:52.044 --> 07:53.847
I mean, you did say,
"Don't give us any bills.

07:53.914 --> 07:55.618
That creepy eye pyramid
freaks us out."

07:55.685 --> 07:58.356
Sticky hand? I'm buying.
I mean Mom's buying.

07:58.423 --> 07:59.793
- I'm good.
- Hey, remember that thing?

07:59.859 --> 08:01.797
Oh, yeah. The spaceship
kiddie ride thing.

08:01.863 --> 08:03.867
We used to pretend we were
astronauts on a mission

08:03.934 --> 08:06.038
for Gene to be the first person
to poop on the moon.

08:06.138 --> 08:08.242
Yeah. He said that's
what the craters were for.

08:08.309 --> 08:09.512
I felt bad for the craters.

08:09.579 --> 08:11.683
You know, we have
all this change.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.687
Should we take a trip
to the moon

08:13.787 --> 08:15.825
for old times' sake?
Visit some old moon poops?

08:15.925 --> 08:18.429
Oh. I guess.
I don't think we can both fit.

08:18.496 --> 08:19.599
Why don't you go first?

08:19.699 --> 08:21.168
I was already climbing in,
but okay.

08:21.302 --> 08:22.270
Here. Hold these.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.540
And don't eat all the red ones.

08:23.607 --> 08:25.377
Or the green ones.
Or the yellow ones.

08:25.443 --> 08:26.479
So just the black ones, then?

08:26.546 --> 08:27.515
- Not those, either.
- Okay.

08:27.615 --> 08:30.153
And blast off!

08:30.220 --> 08:33.527
Huh. Kind of slower
and more boring than I remember.

08:33.627 --> 08:36.098
Yeah. I don't even think
that's how spaceships move.

08:36.165 --> 08:37.367
Hey. Hold something out,

08:37.434 --> 08:38.570
and I'll slap it
with this sticky hand.

08:38.670 --> 08:39.973
- Hold out a jelly bean.
- Huh.

08:40.073 --> 08:41.475
That might be impossible, but...

08:41.543 --> 08:43.246
Oh, you got it. Do it again.

08:43.279 --> 08:44.716
- Yes!
- Whoa.

08:44.783 --> 08:47.387
Hey, I think we just invented
an amazing new thing.

08:47.454 --> 08:48.824
Are we gonna be wealthy now?

08:48.891 --> 08:50.093
I think so. Or we just found

08:50.193 --> 08:52.264
a new complicated way
to eat jelly beans.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.734
Yeah, we did.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.807
I can't believe
Teddy's package never came.

08:56.907 --> 08:59.546
I had to be at the restaurant
for 12 hours today for nothing.

08:59.612 --> 09:01.616
I mean, it's how we try
to make a living.

09:01.683 --> 09:02.719
Never mind.

09:02.819 --> 09:04.923
And Teddy just texted

09:04.989 --> 09:07.027
that now the package
is coming tomorrow.

09:07.094 --> 09:07.995
That's annoying.

09:08.062 --> 09:09.632
Should we stop being
friends with him?

09:09.699 --> 09:11.435
No. Maybe. No.

09:11.503 --> 09:13.239
Oh, Tina, Louise,
that reminds me.

09:13.272 --> 09:15.176
Can you go to the store
again tomorrow after school?

09:15.243 --> 09:17.147
I forgot to put
laundry detergent on the list,

09:17.180 --> 09:19.151
and we need it bad.
I've been wearing the same socks

09:19.218 --> 09:21.489
for three days, and my feet are
getting all cranky and stanky.

09:21.590 --> 09:23.092
Sure, Mom. We can go
back to the store.

09:23.159 --> 09:25.564
Wait a sec. Did you guys
give me back my change?

09:25.664 --> 09:27.902
Ah. Sorry.
They just gave us coins.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.473
They had no small bills.
They said they got rid of them

09:30.608 --> 09:32.444
'cause they were just too small.
Right, Tina?

09:32.578 --> 09:34.616
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:34.682 --> 09:36.620
Hey, Gene, should we take
a peek at your seeds?

09:36.720 --> 09:38.222
See if anything grew
from this afternoon?

09:38.289 --> 09:40.795
Maybe, you know, take some
measurements for your report?

09:40.861 --> 09:42.732
I mean, it's hard
to concentrate on TV

09:42.799 --> 09:44.636
when we've got microgreens
growing, right?

09:44.669 --> 09:46.405
Ah, I don't want to bother them.

09:46.506 --> 09:47.742
Come on. It's probably too soon,

09:47.842 --> 09:49.512
but maybe a radical or two
has sprouted.

09:49.579 --> 09:51.516
Radical?
Are these seeds hippies?

09:51.550 --> 09:53.620
No. Uh, according
to your worksheet,

09:53.720 --> 09:55.390
radical is the name
of the first thing

09:55.457 --> 09:56.492
that sprouts out of the seed.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.764
I think we should call it
the sprouty outy thingy.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.433
Purrbo agrees.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.070
Oh, no. He's just cold.

10:23.747 --> 10:25.216
- Hey, Gene.
- Oh, hey, Dad.

10:25.283 --> 10:27.087
I can't stay long. I got to
get back to the restaurant.

10:27.187 --> 10:28.924
But I just wanted to see how
your observations were going.

10:28.991 --> 10:30.661
Did anything grow
while you were at school?

10:30.761 --> 10:32.798
Okay, I did come up here
and peek earlier.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.569
They're growing,
and they're amazing, right?

10:34.669 --> 10:36.540
Speaking of amazing,
listen to this.

10:38.844 --> 10:39.779
Huh?

10:39.913 --> 10:41.883
Yeah. Uh, okay, Gene,

10:41.950 --> 10:44.789
your microgreens observation
project is due tomorrow,

10:44.856 --> 10:46.125
and you've barely observed it.

10:46.192 --> 10:48.095
I've observed it.
The seeds grew, right?

10:48.196 --> 10:50.634
I mean, I don't want to use
the word "predictable," but...

10:50.701 --> 10:52.905
Okay. That's it.
Look, I don't want to do this,

10:52.972 --> 10:54.676
but I've got to take away Purrbo

10:54.742 --> 10:56.345
until you finish
the microgreens project.

10:56.412 --> 10:57.682
What? No!

10:57.748 --> 10:59.484
Gene, you need to focus
on the sprouts,

10:59.586 --> 11:01.021
not to mention it's interesting.

11:01.088 --> 11:02.925
I mean, we grew food
in your room.

11:02.992 --> 11:04.696
I've grown food
in my room before.

11:04.762 --> 11:05.998
I mean, stuff has grown
on the food

11:06.098 --> 11:07.835
I've had in my room,
but same dif.

11:07.902 --> 11:09.672
Okay, I'm taking this.
Give it to me.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.108
No, no, no, no, no! Aah!

11:11.208 --> 11:13.112
Okay, but listen to me.
Purrbo could die.

11:13.212 --> 11:16.586
- You have to keep him alive.
- I'll keep him alive.

11:16.686 --> 11:18.991
- Promise to keep him alive!
- I promise.

11:19.091 --> 11:20.794
I mean, it doesn't seem
like that hard of a game.

11:20.895 --> 11:22.565
What do the buttons do?

11:22.665 --> 11:24.434
Gene, it'll be fine.
Now get to work

11:24.502 --> 11:25.871
on your report, all right?

11:25.971 --> 11:27.340
Don't let him freeze!
And don't let him overheat!

11:27.407 --> 11:30.313
And don't put him in
a turtleneck! He hates that!

11:34.421 --> 11:36.225
So get this. Teddy said they
haven't shipped the salmon yet.

11:36.292 --> 11:38.496
They think it's gonna
go out today. Unbelievable.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.935
I mean, is the salmon nervous
about flying or something?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.738
- Have a couple drinks, salmon.
- Hmm.

11:42.805 --> 11:44.141
Also, I'm pretty sure
Louise and Tina

11:44.274 --> 11:46.011
chugged all the milk
and then said we're out of milk

11:46.111 --> 11:47.715
so they can go
to the store again.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.051
These errands are getting
pretty expensive

11:49.151 --> 11:50.654
with how much they're
skimming off the top

11:50.721 --> 11:51.823
to do whatever it is
they're doing.

11:51.890 --> 11:53.860
- Yeah!
- Yes!

11:53.961 --> 11:55.798
We are the world champions
at this.

11:55.864 --> 11:57.367
Take that, France!

11:57.434 --> 11:58.537
What was that?

11:58.604 --> 11:59.839
Was that the cat game?

11:59.939 --> 12:01.743
Yeah, I promised Gene
I'd take care of it.

12:01.810 --> 12:03.045
Uh, looks like it's windy.

12:03.112 --> 12:05.149
So I guess I press this button?

12:05.216 --> 12:07.788
And there's a jacket,
and that's it.

12:07.888 --> 12:10.059
Uh-oh. Did you play
the confiscation card

12:10.126 --> 12:11.763
and now you're on Purrbo duty

12:11.830 --> 12:13.165
and no one's laughing at you
at all?

12:13.232 --> 12:15.003
You saw how he is
with this thing, Lin.

12:15.036 --> 12:16.973
I had no choice. And also,

12:17.007 --> 12:19.211
maybe this is the parental
move of the year

12:19.278 --> 12:21.650
and people will want me
to write parenting books,

12:21.716 --> 12:23.019
and I won't dedicate
my books to you.

12:23.085 --> 12:24.956
Ugh. Now it's sunny.

12:25.023 --> 12:27.828
This isn't fun. I-I don't even
like dressing myself.

12:27.895 --> 12:29.031
It shows.

12:29.164 --> 12:30.734
- Hey, Bob. Hey, Linda.
- Joel!

12:30.801 --> 12:31.903
What happened to your arm?

12:31.970 --> 12:33.339
I slipped on a wet floor.

12:33.406 --> 12:35.076
You know that phrase
"slippery when wet"?

12:35.143 --> 12:36.613
Turns out not just the name

12:36.646 --> 12:37.915
of a Bon Jovi album. Hmm.

12:38.015 --> 12:39.819
Aw, you give floors a bad name.

12:39.919 --> 12:41.723
Here, let me come out
and help you.

12:41.790 --> 12:43.359
- Thanks, Joel.
- See you, Bob.

12:43.459 --> 12:46.131
Hey, Dad, I'm confused about
what I'm supposed to measure,

12:46.231 --> 12:48.102
the leafy thing
or the long thing.

12:48.169 --> 12:50.440
The long thing.
It's called a stem, I think.

12:50.541 --> 12:53.079
Here, let me put this inside,
and I'll come up and help.

12:53.145 --> 12:55.884
Okay. So how's Purrbo?
Does he miss me?

12:55.951 --> 12:57.387
He's fine. He's right he...

12:57.454 --> 12:59.024
- Oh, no.
- What?

12:59.091 --> 13:02.030
I had Purrbo in my hand
when I went to get the bread,

13:02.097 --> 13:04.769
and I must have put it down
inside the truck.

13:04.836 --> 13:06.105
- What?!
- Oh, Gene.

13:06.205 --> 13:08.242
Uh, it'll be okay.
We'll get him back.

13:08.309 --> 13:11.516
We'd better find him soon,
or Purrbo's gonna get a sunburn

13:11.583 --> 13:13.452
or a rainburn, all of the burns!

13:13.553 --> 13:15.223
This is a nightmare!

13:15.289 --> 13:19.699
Nightmares are just insights
into suppressed emotions!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.803
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.406
Crap. Went to voice mail.

13:23.472 --> 13:24.474
Hey, Joel. It's Bob.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.778
Uh, I think I accidentally

13:25.878 --> 13:27.314
left my son's
little cat game thing

13:27.380 --> 13:29.852
- in the back of your truck.
- Tell Purrbo to be strong!

13:29.919 --> 13:31.723
- Tell him Gene loves him!
- Aw.

13:31.856 --> 13:33.125
Uh, you probably heard that.

13:33.225 --> 13:35.063
C-Could you please call me
when you get this?

13:35.096 --> 13:37.768
Thanks. Okay.
So Joel will call me back,

13:37.868 --> 13:39.572
and then we'll go pick it up.

13:41.108 --> 13:42.477
Ooh. I got to run
to the bathroom.

13:42.545 --> 13:44.114
Bob, can you keep an eye out
for Teddy's salmon?

13:44.181 --> 13:45.718
And that's not a fun euphemism.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.454
Okay. Gene,
I'm really, really sorry

13:47.555 --> 13:50.259
I left Purrbo in Joel's truck,
but he'll call back soon.

13:50.326 --> 13:53.867
In the meantime, how about we
finish your microgreens project?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.838
Purrbo would want you to.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.708
You don't understand, Dad.
If Purrbo dies,

13:57.775 --> 13:59.512
I have to start over
with a new cat,

13:59.612 --> 14:01.048
and the history
of all the outfits

14:01.148 --> 14:02.718
I've ever changed him into erases.

14:02.818 --> 14:04.789
We need to find him now!

14:04.856 --> 14:06.158
Gene, what are we
supposed to do,

14:06.258 --> 14:07.895
just drive around
with the windows down

14:07.995 --> 14:10.066
screaming "Joel"
and hoping he hears us?

14:10.133 --> 14:12.003
Joel!

14:12.070 --> 14:13.840
This is ridiculous.
We should go home

14:13.907 --> 14:15.276
and finish
your microgreens project.

14:15.343 --> 14:17.782
Disagree!
This is way more important

14:17.848 --> 14:19.719
than measuring
paper towel plants.

14:19.786 --> 14:21.088
What is the point of that
anyway?

14:21.155 --> 14:22.925
Uh, maybe it's to help
feed the world?

14:22.992 --> 14:24.294
What's the point of Purrbo?

14:24.394 --> 14:26.866
To dress a cat appropriately
for the weather!

14:26.933 --> 14:29.204
Are we really
having this debate?

14:29.304 --> 14:30.541
Joel!

14:30.641 --> 14:31.876
Oh, my God. Wait.

14:31.976 --> 14:33.780
Are those your sisters
riding on that thing

14:33.880 --> 14:35.718
that's supposed to be
for little kids?

14:35.784 --> 14:37.454
What are you guys doing?

14:37.521 --> 14:40.293
Uh, shopping for Mom.
What are you doing?

14:40.359 --> 14:42.765
We don't have time
for Operation Moon Poops!

14:42.832 --> 14:44.769
We're looking
for the bun delivery guy.

14:44.836 --> 14:46.906
- Aren't we all?
- He has Purrbo, damn it!

14:47.006 --> 14:48.309
- Have you seen him?
- I don't know.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.213
Maybe a couple quarters
would jog my memory.

14:50.279 --> 14:52.016
Oh, can you take this
home to Mom?

14:52.083 --> 14:53.887
- Okay. Wh-What's in here?
- Milk.

14:53.954 --> 14:56.058
- It's warm.
- That's, uh, weird.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.997
- It was cold an hour ago.
- We got to go! We got to go!

14:59.097 --> 15:01.068
Okay. Okay. Okay.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.540
Hope you ordered a burger,
'cause I brought you one.

15:03.673 --> 15:05.811
(laughs, gasps) Oh, no!

15:05.911 --> 15:08.249
- What?
- No!

15:08.315 --> 15:10.654
No! Why?

15:10.721 --> 15:11.923
Are you okay?

15:11.990 --> 15:13.760
I missed the delivery!

15:13.827 --> 15:16.031
Teddy, I'm so sorry!

15:16.098 --> 15:18.637
Can I just get that burger
from you real quick?

15:18.703 --> 15:20.072
Stupid, stupid salmon!

15:20.173 --> 15:22.043
- Joel!
- That's it.

15:22.143 --> 15:23.547
We're done. I'm turning around.
We're going home.

15:23.613 --> 15:27.555
What? No! Admit it, Dad.
You never cared about Purrbo.

15:27.621 --> 15:28.890
That's not true, Gene.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.727
I mean, I don't, really. Sorry.

15:30.794 --> 15:33.432
You and I just have different
relationships with Purrbo.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.938
Jealous much?
There's Joel!

15:36.004 --> 15:37.575
- Joel!
- Joel!

15:37.675 --> 15:38.977
Bob, what's going on?

15:39.077 --> 15:40.346
Is there an obvious problem
with your buns?

15:40.446 --> 15:42.150
Could you tell that
I kneaded them with my forehead?

15:42.217 --> 15:43.854
No, no. I left you a message.

15:43.954 --> 15:45.356
I'm pretty sure
I left my son's game

15:45.456 --> 15:47.828
in the back of your truck.
Uh, can we take a quick look?

15:47.895 --> 15:49.899
Oh, sure.
There it is.

15:49.966 --> 15:51.068
Purrbo!

15:51.135 --> 15:52.872
He froze to death!

15:52.905 --> 15:55.844
No...!

15:55.911 --> 15:58.550
Oh, my God. Gene, I'm so sorry.

15:59.852 --> 16:01.155
- Hey, Bob.
- Yeah?

16:01.221 --> 16:02.725
Is it rude if I gently
move your son

16:02.791 --> 16:05.864
away from the back of my truck,
close the doors and drive away?

16:05.931 --> 16:07.601
Uh, I'll-I'll move him.

16:12.010 --> 16:14.641
- I'm so sorry, Gene.
- Just get me home.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.043
I need to get
on the Purrbo forum.

16:16.110 --> 16:17.981
I'm going as fast as I can.

16:18.047 --> 16:19.784
Look, I know
you're really mad at me

16:19.851 --> 16:21.187
and you probably
want some space,

16:21.287 --> 16:24.594
but maybe you can start over
with a new Purrbo.

16:24.661 --> 16:28.302
How dare you! His sweet little
kitty body isn't even cold yet.

16:28.369 --> 16:31.475
I mean, it is because
you let him freeze to death.

16:31.575 --> 16:32.944
Again, I'm so sorry.

16:33.044 --> 16:34.714
Plus, I don't want a new Purrbo.

16:34.814 --> 16:36.585
I want this one
with my outfits history.

16:36.652 --> 16:40.191
That's probably gone forever,
like kitty litter in the wind.

16:40.258 --> 16:43.264
Do you, uh, want me
to tell you a story?

16:43.332 --> 16:46.270
That used to make you feel
better when you were little.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.039
No! Maybe.

16:47.105 --> 16:49.511
Okay. Uh, once upon a time,

16:49.577 --> 16:51.648
there was, uh, a cat.

16:51.715 --> 16:53.117
Oh, shoot. Sorry.

16:53.151 --> 16:55.356
I don't know why I said that.
It just came out.

16:56.491 --> 16:57.493
That's 19,

16:57.560 --> 16:58.829
which is one away from 20.

16:58.896 --> 17:00.198
Which is the most amount
of jelly beans

17:00.265 --> 17:02.303
anyone has ever gotten
with a sticky hand ever.

17:02.403 --> 17:04.407
And the most jelly beans
someone's sister has ever

17:04.474 --> 17:07.313
held up for them to hit with
a sticky hand ever, probably.

17:07.413 --> 17:09.984
- Yep.
- Excuse me. We got a complaint

17:10.085 --> 17:11.988
that you two have been
hogging the spaceship.

17:12.089 --> 17:13.726
Who, us?

17:13.759 --> 17:15.228
No. We just got here.

17:15.296 --> 17:17.900
Aren't you guys a little old
to be riding this thing?

17:17.967 --> 17:20.673
Excuse me?
I'm four, and she's five,

17:20.740 --> 17:22.042
and we're tall for our age.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.146
Well, anyway,
please vacate the ship.

17:24.246 --> 17:26.150
Wait. No, you got to
let us keep going.

17:26.250 --> 17:29.089
We're about to catch our 20th
jelly bean with a sticky hand.

17:29.156 --> 17:31.027
Do you have any idea
what that means?

17:31.093 --> 17:32.397
No. I'm not sure
what you're saying.

17:32.463 --> 17:35.603
It means we're about
to make history here.

17:35.703 --> 17:37.774
Oh, great. The ride stopped.

17:37.874 --> 17:39.109
Okay, buckaroo. Your turn.

17:39.176 --> 17:40.913
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

17:41.013 --> 17:43.352
Fine. But this store is ageist.

17:43.452 --> 17:44.521
Yeah. And also,

17:44.587 --> 17:46.458
when sticky hand jelly beaning
is a professional sport,

17:46.525 --> 17:49.631
- you're gonna look like a fool.
- You make me sick!

17:49.731 --> 17:51.868
Stupid missed delivery slip.

17:51.968 --> 17:53.939
Uh-oh. It's Teddy.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.476
- Uh, you get it.
- Huh?

17:55.543 --> 17:56.311
No, no. That's crazy.

17:56.411 --> 17:57.747
Uh, just kidding.
You enjoy your meal.

17:57.814 --> 17:59.283
- Hi, Teddy.
- Hey, Lin.

17:59.350 --> 18:01.287
I'm at the beach
looking at the ocean,

18:01.354 --> 18:03.525
where fish live, and it
made me think of salmon,

18:03.592 --> 18:04.828
so I thought I'd check in.

18:04.894 --> 18:07.065
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, uh, how's your mom doing?

18:07.132 --> 18:09.269
Has she been hanging
a whole lot of tens?

18:09.337 --> 18:10.439
Mom's doing great.

18:10.539 --> 18:12.310
She's making me take
slo-mo videos of her surfing.

18:12.376 --> 18:14.781
She said she's gonna figure out
a way to monetize it.

18:14.914 --> 18:16.083
I don't really get how.

18:16.150 --> 18:18.121
- That's fun.
- Yeah. So, any updates,

18:18.187 --> 18:19.991
fish-related or otherwise?

18:20.091 --> 18:22.062
Listen, Teddy,
I got to tell you something.

18:22.129 --> 18:23.665
Okay.

18:23.766 --> 18:25.736
Hi. Are you, uh, Linda Belcher?

18:25.803 --> 18:27.673
Yes! Oh, my God. Thank you.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.176
Uh, a package just arrived,

18:29.276 --> 18:32.149
and-and it says "perishable"
on the box, and "Alaska."

18:32.215 --> 18:33.919
Lin, it's got to be the salmon.

18:34.019 --> 18:35.589
- So I didn't miss the delivery.
- What?

18:35.656 --> 18:39.062
But then what was this? Oh,
it was Bob's special insoles.

18:39.196 --> 18:41.501
Oh, he's gonna be sad. He was
really excited about those.

18:41.601 --> 18:43.972
Teddy, I'm gonna put the salmon
in the freezer right now.

18:44.106 --> 18:46.177
Great. Thanks.
Hey, Lin, I ordered some ribs

18:46.243 --> 18:48.247
and had them sent to you guys
as a thank-you.

18:48.315 --> 18:51.220
The delivery should come
between 5:00 a. m. and 3:00 p. m.

18:51.287 --> 18:53.257
- Oh, God.
- You got to dip it in the vinegar,

18:53.358 --> 18:56.030
- which I had sent separately.
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:56.130 --> 18:59.036
And that's coming sometime
between 9:00 and 9:00.

18:59.136 --> 18:59.971
No!

19:00.071 --> 19:01.441
All right. Fine. I like ribs.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.347
Okay, I searched the forum,
and Meow-ton Abbey says

19:04.414 --> 19:06.217
you should be able
to keep your history

19:06.283 --> 19:08.889
if you push a pin in the hole
on the top of Purrbo

19:08.956 --> 19:10.960
and press both buttons
at the same time.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.530
I guess Purrbo and I
know each other well enough

19:12.630 --> 19:15.135
for me to do that to him.
I'm gonna find a pushpin.

19:15.268 --> 19:17.272
Huh. That looks
like an active forum.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.511
It's a very supportive
and nurturing community.

19:19.577 --> 19:22.048
I was looking forward
to posting something.

19:22.149 --> 19:24.052
My name was gonna be
Bohemian Cat-sody.

19:24.153 --> 19:26.223
- Huh. Nice.
- Okay. Found a pin.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.294
Here. Let me hold the pin
in the hole,

19:28.362 --> 19:30.265
and y-you push the buttons.

19:30.332 --> 19:32.436
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on, come on, come on, Purrbo.

19:32.503 --> 19:33.572
- He's back.
- Yes!

19:33.639 --> 19:34.374
Hold on.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.444
Let me see if my outfits
are still there.

19:36.511 --> 19:38.114
- Yes!
- Oh, thank God.

19:38.181 --> 19:40.151
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm so happy

19:40.251 --> 19:42.155
to see that cat
and his clothes again.

19:42.255 --> 19:43.926
- Now I can finish my project.
- Great.

19:44.026 --> 19:45.329
L-Let's observe some sprouts.

19:45.396 --> 19:47.967
Oh. Not that project.
A Purrbo-based project.

19:48.034 --> 19:50.171
- A Purr-ject.
- Oh. Wh-What is it?

19:50.271 --> 19:52.443
It's not finished, but I'll
show you what I have so far.

19:52.543 --> 19:54.914
♪ Meow, meow, meow ♪

19:54.948 --> 19:56.318
♪ Meow, meow ♪

19:56.384 --> 19:58.856

20:00.392 --> 20:02.296

20:02.363 --> 20:04.300
I don't know if anything
has ever won every Oscar,

20:04.367 --> 20:06.136
but I feel like this has a shot.

20:06.203 --> 20:07.540
I mean, I have to admit

20:07.607 --> 20:10.278
I don't love that game,
but look what you did.

20:10.346 --> 20:13.050
You made something new
and creative and fun with it

20:13.117 --> 20:15.288
because you're interested
in interesting things,

20:15.322 --> 20:18.160
which I wasn't worried about
at all that much.

20:18.227 --> 20:20.366
I'm sorry I gave you
such a hard time about Purrbo.

20:20.432 --> 20:23.070
That's okay. I know it's
way over some people's head.

20:23.170 --> 20:24.507
Yeah. But you know what?

20:24.607 --> 20:26.978
We should still probably finish
your microgreens report.

20:27.078 --> 20:28.382
It is due tomorrow, right?

20:28.482 --> 20:30.319
Maybe I just show my teacher
this Purrbo thing

20:30.386 --> 20:32.088
and say I took
a different approach?

20:32.188 --> 20:33.592
I don't think that'll work.

20:33.659 --> 20:35.996
Can I at least dress
the microgreens in little hats?

20:36.063 --> 20:38.100
- Sure.
- Yeah!

20:38.167 --> 20:40.339
So you guys finished
both projects?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.209
- Yep.
- Yeah. We made my Purrbo video,

20:42.275 --> 20:44.347
and we observed the heck
out of some broccoli sprouts

20:44.447 --> 20:46.318
to the point where I think
they got uncomfortable.

20:46.384 --> 20:48.488
And you'll be enjoying them
with your meal this evening,

20:48.589 --> 20:50.291
which I assume
will make them happy.

20:50.359 --> 20:52.095
- Hey, Tina, hold up a sprout.
- Okay.

20:52.195 --> 20:53.365
- Yeah!
