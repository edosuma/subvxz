Your eating disorder
is your truth, and...

It's not. It's how I get small.

11:19.380 --> 11:22.080
I had no right
to co-opt your story.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.970
Okay? I apologize.

You are on your own now.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.830
You need to be careful
about your calorie intake, okay?

12:04.030 --> 12:05.450
Are you keeping your food log?

12:05.650 --> 12:07.660
Yes, Mom,
I am completely balanced.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.080
You look an inch or two shorter
than usual,

12:09.280 --> 12:10.670
so you might need
to add 50 calories.

12:10.870 --> 12:12.710
Okay, I'm just... I'm just
gonna check your height.

12:12.910 --> 12:14.000

20:25.510 --> 20:27.290
Sorry, "tr-tragic underbelly"?

20:27.490 --> 20:29.580
- It's a rebrand.
- Oh, it's a complete
and total rebrand, right?

20:29.780 --> 20:31.420
- Mm-hmm.
- So, Little Cricket's dead.
RIP.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.340
Now it's "meet Emma,

20:33.540 --> 20:35.260
teen making her way at God U."

20:35.450 --> 20:38.800
Only now, she's battling her own
sort of internal supervillains.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.680
- [Tiffany] Mm.
- From the body image stuff,

20:40.880 --> 20:42.010
the eating disorder...

20:42.210 --> 20:43.890
- The eating disorder.
- Yes.

20:44.090 --> 20:47.020
And, um, you know, uh,
society's cruel notion

20:47.220 --> 20:48.520
of female perfection, right?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.770
Yeah, isn't that stuff
all a little personal?

20:50.970 --> 20:52.230
[Courtenay] No, no,
that's the point. The point.

20:52.430 --> 20:53.440
'Cause we're pulling it all
out of the shadows.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.650
- Yeah.
- And if I'm being honest
with you,

20:55.850 --> 20:58.280
- I'm a little sick
of Vought's glossy bullshit.
- Uh-huh.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.200
I want fucking emotion.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.780
I want real pain. Okay?

21:03.980 --> 21:05.540
Right now, we're working with

21:05.740 --> 21:08.160
<i>Eaten Alive</i>

21:08.360 --> 21:11.100
or <i>Feeling Small.</i>

21:12.100 --> 21:15.170
[chuckles] Uh, it's a... You
know, it's a starting-off point.

21:15.370 --> 21:16.920
- We-we can develop it, honey.
- [Emma] I'm sorry.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.920
Ex-Excuse me, I have to...

21:19.120 --> 21:20.730
I have to use the restroom.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.470
[Jordan] I don't like
to ring my own bell,

21:23.670 --> 21:24.800
but I am putting up
the best stats of anyone here.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.310
- [grunts]
- Forensics, combat.

21:26.510 --> 21:27.810
Mm, but you don't like
to ring your own bell?

21:28.010 --> 21:29.270
Look, I know how it works.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.940
I know that the trustees
decide the rankings.

21:32.140 --> 21:34.560
- [sighs]
- Look, I'd love your vote.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.030
I like you, Jordan. I just wish
I liked your numbers.

21:37.220 --> 21:40.780
Q Rating, Name Recognition,
Social Trending... all down.

21:40.980 --> 21:43.260
Well, Brink always said those
aren't the numbers that matter.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.330
- He's not here anymore.
- [Paul] Hi.

21:46.530 --> 21:47.370
We're Jordan's folks.

21:47.570 --> 21:48.950
- Paul. My wife Kayla.
- Mm.

21:49.150 --> 21:50.120
Nice to meet you.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.870
Kyle Vogler.
You have a fine kid.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.080
A real go-getter.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.090
Don't let him fool you.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.290
He was a holy terror as a boy.

21:56.490 --> 21:57.550
[laughing]

21:57.750 --> 21:58.800
Uh, we're from Rochester.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.010
Where are you from, Kyle?

22:00.210 --> 22:02.230
[Kyle] Oh. Uh, here and there.

22:09.490 --> 22:10.390
[sniffles]

22:10.590 --> 22:12.810
[shuddering]

22:13.010 --> 22:14.160
[door opens]

22:15.160 --> 22:17.040
[door closes]

22:18.080 --> 22:19.630
[water running]

22:24.800 --> 22:25.800
[water stops]

22:34.060 --> 22:35.140
Pretty dress.

22:37.060 --> 22:38.060
Thanks.

22:44.820 --> 22:46.490
How do you pee in it?

22:47.900 --> 22:49.240
[chuckles softly]

22:50.280 --> 22:51.280
[grunts softly]

22:52.660 --> 22:53.660
[grunts]

22:54.700 --> 22:55.910
[grunts]

22:59.460 --> 23:01.380
Want me to run the water
or something?

23:05.420 --> 23:07.820
I'm really sorry, Emma.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.330
We've all been there.

23:09.530 --> 23:11.290
No, I mean...

23:11.490 --> 23:12.580
for everything.

23:12.780 --> 23:16.350
[scoffs] I don't want
to just be roommates.

23:17.350 --> 23:19.170
And I don't pity you.

23:19.370 --> 23:21.000
Like, at all.
I wish I was like you.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.560
You're fucking badass. And I...

23:25.190 --> 23:27.340
I know this is probably
too little, too late,

23:27.540 --> 23:29.740
but I'd-I'd really like us
to be...

23:31.910 --> 23:33.660
...friends.

23:34.910 --> 23:36.910
[whispers] Thank you.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.650
I-I don't know if I can...
if I can pee like this though.

23:41.850 --> 23:43.040
[shushes]

23:44.040 --> 23:46.400
- [urinating]
- Just let it happen.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.660
So, when he was in third grade,
there was this girl, Ruby.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.160
- Don't embarrass him.
- No, it was forever ago.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.580
Jordan used to chase Ruby
around the playground,

23:53.780 --> 23:55.120
trying to kiss her. [chuckles]

23:55.320 --> 23:56.750
Try getting away with that
this day and age.

23:56.950 --> 23:58.580
- [Kyle chuckles]
- Until one day,

23:58.780 --> 24:02.000
Ruby whacks him clean in
the face with a Noir lunch box.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.920
Knocked his front tooth out.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.090
Now, that's spirit.

24:06.290 --> 24:07.760
I used to say,

24:07.960 --> 24:09.470
"Jordan and Ruby,

24:09.670 --> 24:12.640
they're gonna be husband
and wife one day."

24:12.840 --> 24:15.200
Whatever happened to her,
Jordan?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.730
Well, Daddy, we used
to try on prom dresses together

24:21.930 --> 24:22.980
in high school.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.460
So maybe we can be wife
and wife.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.400
Sorry about this.
He can get dramatic.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.160
Nothing to apologize for.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.530
You got a great kid here.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.470
I'm just gonna let you catch up.

24:37.930 --> 24:39.750
<i>[Courtenay] Oh, absolutely.</i>

24:39.950 --> 24:41.840
Um, you're the star of the show.

24:42.030 --> 24:44.630
Of course we want to...
hear your notes.

24:44.830 --> 24:46.710
Okay, so...

24:46.910 --> 24:48.840
like, maybe it doesn't have
to be, like...

24:49.040 --> 24:51.150
uh, like,
a cautionary tale or a...

24:52.360 --> 24:54.140
I mean, like, why can't I be,
like, inspirational?

24:54.340 --> 24:56.560
I mean,
not like Queen Maeve but...

24:56.760 --> 24:58.230
I mean, like Queen Maeve,
you know?

24:58.430 --> 25:00.830
[chuckles softly] Baby,
you're not like...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.870
You got to work
with what you've got.

25:06.210 --> 25:07.990
But it's k...

25:08.190 --> 25:09.610
I mean, it's exploiting me.

25:09.810 --> 25:11.870
I think, in the real world,

25:12.060 --> 25:13.870
everybody uses everyone.

25:14.070 --> 25:18.010
And I think that this could
help you in a million ways.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.520
You know she taught me
how to do it?

25:24.140 --> 25:25.900
How to stick my fingers
down my throat.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.650
Until I vomited bile.

25:37.990 --> 25:39.990
[quietly] Go fuck yourself.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.310
[Courtenay] Holy shit.

25:42.510 --> 25:45.150
This is fan-fucking-tastic.

25:45.350 --> 25:46.570
[sighs] You're gonna need
a whole nother room

25:46.770 --> 25:48.990
for all the People's Choices.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.740
[Polarity] You know, I'm working
on my charitable contributions

25:50.940 --> 25:51.740
for the calendar year.

25:51.940 --> 25:53.200
And you are still chairwoman

25:53.400 --> 25:55.240
- of Vought for Tots, right?
- Mm.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.990
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, I got to hit the bathroom.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.210
- All that champagne.
- Uh, come right back.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.100
Of course. Yes, yes.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.520
Hey.

26:07.810 --> 26:09.520
What-what-what are you doing?

26:10.770 --> 26:12.470
What, I can't buy a ticket?

26:12.670 --> 26:15.610
- [chuckles]
- You-you-you pushed somebody
for the free booze.

26:16.650 --> 26:17.600
Wow.

26:17.800 --> 26:18.600
That's offensive.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.020
Okay?

26:20.220 --> 26:21.430
I can't believe
that you would...

26:21.630 --> 26:23.020
Yes. Yes, I did.

26:23.220 --> 26:24.270
I did that.

26:24.470 --> 26:26.730
If everyone's
gonna be worshiping Brink

26:26.930 --> 26:28.980
and shitting all over Luke,

26:29.180 --> 26:32.320
then I at least want to get
some Grey Goose out of it.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.130
Hmm.

26:35.590 --> 26:37.450
Should we talk
about our intercourse situation?

26:37.650 --> 26:39.080
Uh...

26:39.280 --> 26:40.160
Whoa, sorry.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.580
That sounded so bad. Um...

26:42.780 --> 26:43.750
- Yeah. Yes.
- Yes.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.670
- Just not-not-not now. Later.
- Not now.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.880
- Okay. Okay. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

26:48.080 --> 26:50.520
- But yeah.
- Okay. [chuckles]

26:53.900 --> 26:55.760
[whispers] "Intercourse."

26:55.960 --> 26:57.900
[chatter in distance]

27:04.700 --> 27:05.870
Hey.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.440
What's up?

27:09.640 --> 27:10.880
I'm Andre.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.710
Yeah, I know who you are.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.570
You're Cricket, right?

27:17.770 --> 27:18.800
Emma.

27:22.050 --> 27:24.000
[chuckles] I won't puke
all over your shoes.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.500
Yeah, I saw that video.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.880
Fuck that girl.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.230
Freshman class
is savage this year.

27:31.230 --> 27:33.090
You know, tell you the truth,

27:33.290 --> 27:35.520
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.190
You want to talk to me?

27:39.780 --> 27:42.770
[Paul] We really did come
just to show our support.

27:42.970 --> 27:44.980
Not an easy drive, FYI,

27:45.180 --> 27:47.230
but Dr. Cohen says
we got to meet you halfway.

27:47.430 --> 27:48.400
Paul, not here.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.830
Point is, we're trying.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.110
I'm not a boy, Dad.

27:54.310 --> 27:56.240
Not all the time.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.660
And I'm sorry
that you hate that.

27:57.860 --> 27:58.950
But you are.

27:59.150 --> 28:00.490
You're my firstborn son.

28:00.690 --> 28:03.910
The day you were born
was the best day of my life.

28:04.110 --> 28:06.660
I thought we were giving you
a gift with Compound V.

28:06.860 --> 28:07.790
You did give me a gift.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.210
Can we please
not talk about this?

28:09.410 --> 28:11.060
For you, maybe.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.170
I'm no bigot.

28:16.370 --> 28:19.010
I get a lot of kids
don't have a choice.

28:19.210 --> 28:21.180
But you do.

28:21.380 --> 28:24.660
You can be a boy forever
if you want.

28:26.700 --> 28:29.310
Sometimes I think you change
into a girl just to spite me.

28:29.510 --> 28:31.210
Paul, stop.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.250
I'm just...

28:39.300 --> 28:42.630
...the kid addicted
to their PlayStation.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.790
Who goes to Olive Garden
just for the breadsticks,

28:46.990 --> 28:47.910
who binges <i>Property Brothers.</i>

28:48.110 --> 28:49.970
I've never changed, Dad.

28:54.980 --> 28:58.820
I've always just been me.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.470
[sniffles]

29:04.670 --> 29:05.990
[sighs, sniffles]

29:13.040 --> 29:14.730
[Emma] What the fuck?

29:14.930 --> 29:17.440
Like, what the fuck?

29:17.640 --> 29:19.320
Like, what the fucking fuck?!

29:19.520 --> 29:20.990
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:21.190 --> 29:22.200
What are they doing down there?

29:22.400 --> 29:24.160
I mean, fuck,
could they do that to us?

29:24.360 --> 29:25.990
Are we in danger?
I mean, should we tell someone?

29:26.190 --> 29:27.750
I don't know what we'd say.
All I got is this

29:27.950 --> 29:29.790
and what Luke told me
before his murder-suicide.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.210
It's not exactly credible.

29:31.410 --> 29:32.920
But what I do know is
that we need to go down there

29:33.120 --> 29:35.920
and we need to find out
where they have Luke's brother.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.710
- Mm.
- But...

29:37.910 --> 29:41.550
I can't do it
without getting busted.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.860
But maybe...

29:47.950 --> 29:49.310
Oh, shit!

29:49.510 --> 29:50.350
I mean, saying it out loud,

29:50.550 --> 29:52.350
I know it sounds
like a bad fucking idea,

29:52.550 --> 29:53.940
so you should forget
I said anything.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.690
No, I'm totally,
totally in, dude.

29:55.890 --> 29:58.150
'Cause it is, like,
life-or-death dangerous.

29:58.350 --> 29:59.360
And you're a freshman

29:59.560 --> 30:01.320
and you are not even on
the Crimefighting track.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.280
You know what,
just forget I said anything.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.590
Yes.

30:06.590 --> 30:08.370
But, also,
no matter what you say...

30:08.570 --> 30:10.080
[whispers]
...yes.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.220
♪ ♪

30:16.140 --> 30:18.880
[Andre] Okay, so the GPS tag's
connected to my phone.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.880
Remember, just recon.
No tiny action hero shit.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.220
I think this is
where they're keeping him.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.050
But if you see anything shady,
just bail.

30:25.250 --> 30:26.720
What's his room number again?

Northwest Wing 4.

I'll see you in an hour.

Get it, got it, good.

[Andre] Are you all right?

30:34.800 --> 30:36.270
[Emma] Yeah,
