00:10.802 --> 00:13.347
- Hon, I am so sorry.
- It's all right.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.434
- No, if you were this late, I'd...
- I know how busy you are.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.229
Besides, it's a beautiful day to wait.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.356
And wait.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.650
Have you eaten?

00:24.733 --> 00:29.530
Yeah, I'm sorry, honey, I had to.
I'm scheduled to be offworld at 13.30.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.076
What?

00:34.201 --> 00:36.495
I just found out.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.831
I thought for sure this time.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.128
Thank you.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.172
Thank you very much.

00:47.881 --> 00:52.010
They said it isn't either one of us.
We just have to keep trying.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.388
Not that I mind trying.

00:56.098 --> 00:59.935
I just... I thought we'd be working
on our second child by now.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.104
Me too.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.775
Walk me to the terminal?

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:15.158 --> 01:16.660
Let's get a second opinion.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.914
(Carter) The Aschen are hundreds
of years more advanced in medicine.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.046
So, how long will you be gone?

01:28.172 --> 01:31.175
I have to visit a new embassy
on the southern continent,...

01:31.300 --> 01:34.803
- ..l have to tour the nine planets...
- You're kidding.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.723
Of course. Think I'd miss
your anniversary ceremony?

01:37.806 --> 01:41.643
- No, it's no big deal.
- Right, it's no big deal(!)

01:41.727 --> 01:46.940
If it wasn't for you, we'd never even have
met the Aschen. I'll be back tonight, OK?

01:47.065 --> 01:53.155
(announcer) Travellers to Confederation
planets, stand by in the departure area.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.281
Bye.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.992
Bye.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.743
About face!

03:26.832 --> 03:32.129
(announcer) Ladies and gentlemen,
the President ofthe United States.

03:32.212 --> 03:36.508
My fellowAmericans...
ten years ago, this very day,...

03:37.467 --> 03:41.555
..a team code-named SG-1,
then working in secret,...

03:42.598 --> 03:45.851
..came upon an alien race, the Aschen.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.981
With that introduction, I was
able to forge the greatest alliance...

03:51.064 --> 03:56.278
..this country - indeed, this world -
has everknown.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.447
(applause)

04:03.577 --> 04:09.249
I read now from Colonel
Jack O'Neill's mission report...

04:09.374 --> 04:11.835
..of that fiirst contact.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.714
"These folks sound too good to be true."

04:16.798 --> 04:20.135
"Willing to share
their science and technology."

04:20.219 --> 04:23.222
"Friendly, smarter than we are."

04:24.765 --> 04:27.434
"And one thing's forsure."

04:27.518 --> 04:29.645
"The Goa'uld are coming."

04:29.770 --> 04:32.481
"The Aschen could save ourasses."

04:40.030 --> 04:42.074
Well, guess what, Jack.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.327
They did.

04:47.579 --> 04:51.250
Jack O'Neill could not be here today,
but those candid words,...

04:51.375 --> 04:56.255
..hurriedly scratched down in a mission
report ten years ago, were prescient.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.967
Membership in
the Aschen Confederation...

05:00.092 --> 05:04.471
..guarantees the security, the health...

05:05.681 --> 05:10.811
..and the future ofevery
human being on God's earth.

05:15.482 --> 05:21.738
Dr Samantha Carter, DrDaniel Jackson,
Teal'c, would you please step forward?

05:29.413 --> 05:34.376
Though ournation's business has
kept me from being with you in person,...

05:34.960 --> 05:38.463
..nonetheless I want to thank you
from the bottom ofmy heart...

05:38.547 --> 05:42.384
..for what you have done forme
and for our country.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.728
God bless you all.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.937
Aim!

05:54.062 --> 05:55.564
Fire!

05:56.231 --> 05:58.275
Aim! Fire!

05:59.193 --> 06:01.236
Aim! Fire!

06:06.116 --> 06:09.036
- To General Hammond.
- To General Hammond.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.920
I miss him, especially today.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.465
- How long has it been, anyway?
- It has been six years.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.927
What was Jack's excuse?
I expected to see him here.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.347
O'Neill has made his feelings clear
about the Aschen alliance.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.141
Well, he could have come to see us.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.479
- I almost didn't come myself.
- Really?

06:35.562 --> 06:40.776
It's easier for you, Daniel. Your job
wasn't made obsolete. And if l... Mollem.

06:42.486 --> 06:47.824
Forgive me for interrupting. Ambassador,
the Aschen delegation is eager to hear...

06:47.908 --> 06:50.786
..about your visit to our South Continent.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.080
Yeah, it'd be my pleasure.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.250
Well, I think we can
safely assume I'll be late.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.587
Doctors, Teal'c, congratulations again.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.258
So, where are we goin'?

07:05.217 --> 07:09.388
- I had planned to return to Chulak.
- We haven't see each other in ages.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.891
- Please.
- Very well.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.102
- Dinner?
- Sounds great.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.938
- Great to see you.
- I'll see you soon.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.694
So... what was that?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.530
- What was what?
- Going on again about being obsolete.

07:26.613 --> 07:31.410
Think about it, Sam. We've all taken
the anti-ageing and anti-cancer vaccines.

07:31.493 --> 07:36.623
Now they have machines that can reverse
tissue damage and mend broken bones.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.084
I mean, where does that leave me?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.420
Put that way, I know what you mean.

07:41.503 --> 07:46.216
Half the time their science is so far
over my head, I feel like a lab assistant.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.094
Ah, but you have something to do.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.762
Yeah.

07:50.846 --> 07:54.933
OK, enough of that. Tell me,
by any chance, are you and Joe...

07:56.310 --> 08:01.523
Not yet. They say it isn't either one of us.
We just have to keep trying.

08:01.607 --> 08:05.444
They let me keep an office in Washington,
even though I have nothing to do.

08:05.569 --> 08:09.323
- I'd be happy to give you a checkup.
- No, they said I was fine, really.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.492
The medicine I practise
may seem like the Dark Ages now,...

08:12.618 --> 08:15.954
..but I was your doctor for a long time.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.499
How long have you been trying?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.836
- Almost three years.
- Yes.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.967
When can we do this?

08:35.849 --> 08:39.686
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting, but
I just wanted to double-check my results.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.523
And I'm fine, right?

08:42.606 --> 08:45.317
Sam, I don't know how
your Aschen doctor missed it.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.403
Frankly, I don't think
it's possible he could have.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.280
What?

08:51.240 --> 08:53.200
You can't have children.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.540
- They said everything was normal.
- In every other way, it is.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.042
Then this is a mistake.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.213
Here, let me show you the scan.

09:16.098 --> 09:20.644
There's no room for interpretation.
Clearly, your ovaries are damaged.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.187
Why?

09:22.271 --> 09:25.858
I don't know. I don't know what
caused it or when it happened,...

09:25.983 --> 09:29.403
- ..but obviously it was some time...
- No. I wanna know why...

09:29.528 --> 09:33.198
..the Aschen doctors looked me in the eye
and told me that I was OK.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.576
Why did they lie to me?

09:35.701 --> 09:39.621
I don't know...
but I'm willing to help you find out.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.968
I've been waiting.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.721
- Sorry.
- Is something wrong?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.848
No.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.561
All right.

10:06.481 --> 10:10.777
We're still not finding the necessary
material to initiate the conversion.

10:10.861 --> 10:16.158
Well, we'll just have to find a way to
collapse it faster, revise the calculations.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.535
Interesting.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.747
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're absolutely correct.

10:21.830 --> 10:26.710
It's just that, a year or so ago, you
never thought this project was possible,...

10:26.835 --> 10:30.589
..and now you seem so... determined.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.760
You've convinced me.

10:40.557 --> 10:45.270
Did your people ever imagine
converting a planet into a star?

10:46.063 --> 10:49.149
- No, I doubt it.
- I thought you'd at least considered it,...

10:49.274 --> 10:53.111
..given the rapid growth of your
population, the viability of the planet...

10:53.237 --> 10:57.699
Well, humans just don't think
quite as far ahead as the Aschen seem to.

10:59.660 --> 11:05.207
All right, since you are so... determined,
revise the calculations.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.293
If I use our computers, it'll take weeks.

11:08.836 --> 11:13.632
On the other hand, if I can interface
with the Aschen computer core...

11:14.842 --> 11:17.928
You know that's strictly
for Aschen personnel.

11:18.053 --> 11:21.557
It's not like you haven't
given me access before.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.229
Samantha, why do I
let you talk me into this?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.276
There.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.280
You have core access.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.993
Thank you, Mollem.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.800
- Are you in?
- Not yet.

11:56.884 --> 12:00.220
The medical sub-core has its own code.
You won't be able to access...

12:00.345 --> 12:02.806
I'm in, I'm in. Now what?

12:04.808 --> 12:09.021
- It's calling for search parameters.
- Try "medical records".

12:12.941 --> 12:15.694
I don't think I'm gonna find
anything specific to me.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.738
Maybe it's happened to others.

12:17.821 --> 12:22.117
Do "general search,
human reproductive statistics".

12:25.162 --> 12:27.623
That's it.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.000
You can read this?

12:30.876 --> 12:33.504
Well, that can't be right.

12:33.587 --> 12:39.134
If I'm reading this properly, the world birth
rate has dropped 91 per cent in two years.

12:39.218 --> 12:41.428
- What?
- That's what it says here.

12:41.512 --> 12:44.056
- These are the Aschen numbers.
- But we would know.

12:44.139 --> 12:48.185
It's happening everywhere
the anti-ageing vaccine has gone.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.646
- Turn it off.
- They're doing it systematically.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.814
Turn it off. Please.

12:54.858 --> 12:58.445
- We can't let them know we know.
- Mollem leaves me alone for hours.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.323
Sam, you're on the inside.
You don't see them as I do.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.076
Janet, this is deliberate.
We have to do something.

13:04.159 --> 13:09.122
I know, but we can't talk about it here.
We'll talk tonight at the restaurant, OK?

13:09.206 --> 13:11.250
I have to go.

13:15.921 --> 13:19.007
It would be public knowledge
if something this catastrophic...

13:19.132 --> 13:22.135
- ..was happening to the entire population.
- Would it?

13:22.261 --> 13:24.930
The Aschen can convert
planets into stars.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.558
You don't think they could
control the media?

13:27.683 --> 13:31.103
Assuming the Aschen can keep
something this big a secret...

13:31.186 --> 13:33.981
It's been ten years. Why now?

13:34.064 --> 13:38.527
We were completely taken in.
This way, they didn't have to fire a shot.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.822
It's slow, methodical... painless.

13:41.905 --> 13:46.285
Why provide a vaccine that doubles the
human life span? It doesn't make sense.

13:46.410 --> 13:49.746
Unless that's the mechanism they use
to sterilise the population.

13:49.830 --> 13:53.083
They're patient enough.
All they have to do is wait.

13:53.208 --> 13:58.422
And within 200 years, there will be
very few, if any, humans remaining.

13:59.631 --> 14:03.468
The Aschen will have
this world unto themselves.

14:05.429 --> 14:10.392
Well, we have to do something.
I don't know... I mean, tell somebody.

14:11.518 --> 14:15.439
The night before General Hammond died,
he called me.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.901
He said he needed to speak to me
about something important.

14:18.984 --> 14:23.780
He couldn't discuss it over the phone.
The next day I told the Aschen doctors.

14:23.864 --> 14:28.076
I said "He could not have died of a
heart attack. He was in perfect health."

14:28.160 --> 14:32.164
But they said their
diagnostic machines were infallible.

14:33.207 --> 14:36.210
You believe he was murdered?

14:36.293 --> 14:41.924
At the time, no. I believed, like everybody
else, the Aschen were our saviours.

14:44.218 --> 14:47.638
So we can't tell anyone.
We have to keep this to ourselves.

14:47.763 --> 14:51.016
- I have to tell Joe.
- Maybe you shouldn't.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.773
- If you're suggesting that he knows...
- It's all of our lives that are at stake here.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.734
- Yes. He can help us.
- How?

15:00.817 --> 15:03.779
Say he goes to the president,
who then tells the world.

15:03.862 --> 15:07.783
Even if what's left of every army on Earth
mobilises, what are they gonna do?

15:07.866 --> 15:10.577
- Fight back.
- They would be defeated.

15:10.661 --> 15:12.704
As were the Goa'uld.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.417
- We have to think of something else.
- Like what?

15:17.543 --> 15:20.712
I don't know. Contact the Tollan.

15:20.796 --> 15:24.383
Find the survivors of the Tok'ra.
There have to be some out there.

15:24.508 --> 15:29.221
- Teal'c, what about the Jaffa?
- Very few remain loyal to the Tauri.

15:30.264 --> 15:34.476
There are few symbiotes
available for implantation.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.271
We don't even control the Stargate.

15:38.146 --> 15:42.192
God, what have we done?
This morning we were celebrating.

15:42.276 --> 15:44.820
Now I wish we could take it all back.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.991
- Will there be anything else?
- Apparently not.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.869
Thank you.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.248
Maybe we can. Take it back.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.585
How?

15:59.710 --> 16:02.421
General Hammond showed us.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.884
He left us a note.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.344
What? What are you talking about?

16:09.428 --> 16:13.098
A number of years ago,
a freak accident sent us back to 1969.

16:13.182 --> 16:15.225
We know that by dialling coordinates...

16:15.309 --> 16:19.354
..precisely on the opposite side of the sun
at the exact moment of a solar flare,...

16:19.438 --> 16:25.277
..the wormhole turns back towards Earth
on itself and it creates a time distortion.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.864
Theoretically, we could
send ourselves a message.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.242
You said it was impossible
to predict a solar flare.

16:32.326 --> 16:36.079
For us it was, but with access
to the Aschen computer...

16:36.163 --> 16:39.333
OK, wait a second. We are considering...

16:39.458 --> 16:43.587
..changing the lives of the entire human
race on Earth. Do we have that right?

16:43.670 --> 16:48.967
If we don't, then we will live to see
the end of the entire human race on Earth.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.037
Hi.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.915
Hi.

17:22.084 --> 17:26.003
So this is the place
you kept threatening to take me?

17:29.508 --> 17:31.969
Good to see you, sir.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.640
I'm retired, Carter. Lose the "sir".

17:39.017 --> 17:41.061
Right.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.482
Jack...

17:46.650 --> 17:48.527
What are you doing here?

17:48.610 --> 17:51.780
It turns out we made a mistake. A big one.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.867
Which one? We made a few.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.994
Our alliance with the Aschen.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.831
Oh, that.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.542
Not workin' out, is it?

18:04.918 --> 18:07.212
Gosh, I wish I'd seen that comin'.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.215
Oh, wait. I did see that comin'.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.385
It isn't what you thought.

18:15.888 --> 18:20.851
A couple of days ago I found out
that I can't ever have children.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.688
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:25.022 --> 18:27.065
So was l.

18:31.987 --> 18:37.326
According to the Aschen doctors,
I was fine, but not according to Dr Fraiser.

18:37.409 --> 18:42.623
We got on the Aschen computer network.
They keep statistics on everything.

18:42.706 --> 18:45.250
In two years,
without our even knowing it,...

18:45.334 --> 18:49.963
..they have managed to sterilise over
90 per cent of the world's population.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.925
The other 10 per cent are
probably just a matter of time.

18:53.008 --> 18:56.845
We don't know how they've done it or
how they've keep it a secret this long...

18:56.970 --> 19:00.557
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Help us.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.852
- Do what?
- We can undo this.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.898
Oh, here we go.

19:08.357 --> 19:12.569
We send a message through the Stargate
to ourselves ten years ago.

19:12.653 --> 19:15.113
We stop this from ever happening.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.701
Stop this from happening.

19:19.827 --> 19:22.371
We know it's possible.

19:22.454 --> 19:25.374
Why am I having this conversation?

19:26.416 --> 19:31.839
We know what to do. I am positive, with
the Aschen computer and observatory,...

19:31.922 --> 19:34.925
..l can predict a flare within
a few hours of its happening.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.845
And we should be able
to get our hands on a GDO.

19:37.928 --> 19:40.931
It comes down to accessing
the gate within that window,...

19:41.014 --> 19:44.935
..dialling the right address
and sending the message.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.897
Well, if it just comes down to that, do it.

19:48.981 --> 19:52.985
If I thought it was gonna be easy,
I wouldn't be asking for your help.

19:54.862 --> 19:58.782
Just out of curiosity... say we do this.

20:00.659 --> 20:05.038
What happens to everything
that's happened in the past ten years?

20:05.164 --> 20:06.498
It won't happen.

20:06.582 --> 20:10.836
So we don't go to P4C-970,
we don't meet the Aschen,...

20:11.879 --> 20:14.840
..then... what?

20:15.465 --> 20:17.342
I don't know.

20:18.886 --> 20:21.346
Let me tell you something, Carter.

20:22.723 --> 20:27.519
If you wanna erase your mistakes,
that's your business.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.022
My conscience is clear.

20:30.105 --> 20:33.108
I warned everybody.
I threw up the red flag.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.904
- Everyone, including you, shut me down.
- I want you to put that behind us.

20:36.987 --> 20:40.073
You're not happy
with the way things turned out?

20:41.325 --> 20:43.368
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:47.623 --> 20:51.668
Personally... I like things the way they are.

20:54.004 --> 20:56.548
No more saving the world, just a...

20:57.674 --> 21:01.845
..nice pond with no pesky fish in it.

21:01.929 --> 21:05.974
And the single most
pressing issue in my life...

21:06.058 --> 21:08.519
..is whether or not to get a dog.

21:10.604 --> 21:13.857
There are a lot of
pros and cons to consider.

21:13.941 --> 21:16.235
I'm talking about
the future of the human race.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.278
So was l.

21:19.238 --> 21:23.534
- We're doing this.
- Let me know how it turns out.

21:24.243 --> 21:28.413
Our chances are a lot better
with you than without you.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.836
Let me ask you something.

21:33.961 --> 21:38.507
What does your dearly beloved
ambassador say about all this?

21:42.553 --> 21:45.389
I haven't had a chance to tell him.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.850
Maybe he can help you.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.393
Yeah.

22:00.112 --> 22:03.782
- We're on our own.
- You're kidding me. He said no.

22:03.907 --> 22:06.618
- It is unfortunate.
- We can still do this.

22:06.702 --> 22:10.914
- Did you track down the GDOs?
- Uh... yes and no.

22:10.998 --> 22:15.794
From museum records, there's only one
original remote left on display at the SGC.

22:15.878 --> 22:18.422
That's our next stop.
Teal'c, return to Chulak.

22:18.505 --> 22:22.259
We don't wanna arouse any more
suspicion. It'll take at least two days.

22:22.342 --> 22:26.555
- We'll contact you when it's time.
- I will be prepared.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.774
Alrighty, everyone.
Everyone please step all the way out.

22:37.858 --> 22:40.152
We've arrived at level 28.

22:40.819 --> 22:44.573
Can anyone guess at
what special room is on this floor?

22:44.656 --> 22:47.826
- The gate room.
- That's very, very close.

22:48.619 --> 22:52.831
- Anyone else?
- Uh, he's right. It's the gate room.

22:52.915 --> 22:55.209
Well, what I'm sure
many of you don't know...

22:55.292 --> 22:59.213
..is that officially it was known
as the "embarkation" room...

22:59.296 --> 23:02.883
..because that's where
the SG teams "embarked" from.

23:03.008 --> 23:06.011
OK, now we're walking. This way.

23:07.387 --> 23:12.267
And these people comprise the famous
SG-1 , arguably the most important,...

23:12.392 --> 23:17.022
..although not my personal favourite,
team of the entire command.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.358
And we're walking.

23:23.654 --> 23:28.200
The real Stargate is in Washington
at the JR Reed space terminal.

23:28.283 --> 23:31.787
This one is a perfect
replica of the original.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.331
Should you want photos,
they are $27 each...

23:34.456 --> 23:39.336
..and please do not touch the Stargate
itself, as you'll leave fingerprints.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.463
See you on the other side!

23:48.220 --> 23:49.638
This is ridiculous.

23:49.721 --> 23:53.559
We couldn't break away
until there were more people around.

23:53.684 --> 23:58.647
- Not her personal favourite SG team?
- Just don't ask for the photo.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.527
And we're walking.

24:17.416 --> 24:19.710
Hey. Thanks for showin'.

24:19.793 --> 24:23.547
We decided to take
the last tour of the day.

24:24.548 --> 24:28.385
So... when did you decide
against getting a dog?

24:29.052 --> 24:31.513
I'm still thinkin' about it.

24:34.558 --> 24:37.728
In the meantime, I did
a little shopping on your behalf.

24:37.811 --> 24:43.025
The zats are completely operational.
This, however, presents a problem.

24:44.943 --> 24:46.987
It's a replica.

24:50.157 --> 24:52.534
Daniel, was this the only one?

24:53.118 --> 24:56.622
Excuse me.
You people aren't supposed to be...

25:02.127 --> 25:04.171
Colonel O'Neill?

25:06.590 --> 25:10.594
Sergeant... what are you doing here?

25:11.386 --> 25:16.934
I work here now.
Sort of the operations tech adviser.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.812
Oh, well, you're doin' a great job.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.900
Uh... this section's closed off.

25:27.528 --> 25:30.155
Are you here for old time's sake?

25:30.239 --> 25:32.449
That's it exactly.

25:32.533 --> 25:34.493
Where did you get those?

25:34.618 --> 25:36.495
The zats?

25:37.788 --> 25:41.208
- Armoury. We're takin' 'em.
- Oh, no, l, uh...

25:41.291 --> 25:44.962
Sergeant, please. This is really important.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.883
Do you know where our real GDOs went?

25:50.008 --> 25:52.928
I'm not a sergeant any more
and you're not colonels.

25:53.011 --> 25:56.849
- You're not supposed to have the remote.
- Good. We don't want that one.

25:56.974 --> 26:00.060
- We want the real one.
- It's in the White House,...

26:00.185 --> 26:03.272
..in the Oval Office,
on the president's desk.

26:04.231 --> 26:06.775
Kinsey grab a souvenir on the way down?

26:06.900 --> 26:09.820
- Look, guys, I don't know what's...
- Uh...

26:10.904 --> 26:12.072
Walter?

26:14.116 --> 26:17.369
Right now I need you to trust us.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.913
Just turn around, walk away.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.792
Pretend we weren't even here.

26:23.876 --> 26:27.212
I'll bring everything back, I promise.

26:27.921 --> 26:29.965
Thursday.

26:30.090 --> 26:34.386
- Then you'll tell me what's going on?
- Absolutely everything.

26:36.430 --> 26:38.473
OK.

26:40.350 --> 26:42.811
- Thank you.
- Thursday.

26:44.605 --> 26:49.735
Last time I was in the Oval Office, I got
kicked out. Can we do without the GDO?

26:49.860 --> 26:51.028
Radio?

26:51.153 --> 26:54.823
There's an EM dampening field,
part of the automated defences.

26:54.907 --> 26:58.827
So... we're about as far back
in time as we're gonna go.

27:01.497 --> 27:04.124
I think I can get it.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.586
Joe?

27:08.754 --> 27:11.048
He's a good guy.

27:11.965 --> 27:16.261
If you tell him...
there will be no going back.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.809
Of course, if you don't tell him,
there'll be no going back.

27:24.061 --> 27:27.314
He'll do it. I know he will.

27:34.112 --> 27:36.156
- (doorshuts)
- Sam?

27:38.534 --> 27:41.245
Hey, honey. How are you feeling?

27:42.913 --> 27:47.000
You went out this morning
before I had a chance to say goodbye.

27:47.084 --> 27:49.127
I'm fine.

27:50.587 --> 27:54.758
Mollem said you left the lab early.
You were feeling kinda ill.

27:57.469 --> 28:00.556
Honey, you're just depressed.
We'll just keep trying.

28:00.681 --> 28:02.724
No, we can't, Joe.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.103
Nobody can.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.605
What are you talking about?

28:09.189 --> 28:11.900
I think this is the note we should send.

28:17.906 --> 28:19.783
That's it?

28:19.867 --> 28:24.413
I thought about giving more information,
but I think the simpler the better.

28:24.538 --> 28:27.541
Why don't we just stick one on a rock
and throw it through?

28:27.624 --> 28:31.378
It would never make it through
the automated defences.

28:32.963 --> 28:36.633
Can we at least mention
who won the Super Bowl in 2004?

28:36.717 --> 28:39.595
- No.
- World Series? Grey Cup?

28:40.012 --> 28:45.225
I put it in my own handwriting, so I'll be
able to recognise it when I read it.

28:46.310 --> 28:49.229
I think we should all
write a note of our own.

28:50.355 --> 28:54.484
In case I don't make it to the gate,
you can keep trying.

28:58.530 --> 29:02.201
- Well, you're wrong.
- I saw the numbers, Joe.

29:02.326 --> 29:06.622
- The Aschen doctor said you were fine.
- This isn't just about me.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.999
I read this right from an Aschen terminal.

29:09.124 --> 29:12.544
Mollem gave me access
to work on something else.

29:13.170 --> 29:16.673
The birth rate has been cut
over 90 per cent.

29:22.471 --> 29:24.515
Oh, my God.

29:31.647 --> 29:34.358
It's supposed to be a third of that.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.948
- You knew.
- The Aschen insisted on it.

29:41.031 --> 29:43.659
- Oh, my God.
- They see further ahead than we do.

29:43.742 --> 29:46.495
- If we didn't limit growth...
- Is that what you call this?

29:46.578 --> 29:49.373
- This is not what we agreed to.
- I can't believe this!

29:49.456 --> 29:52.709
- We didn't have a choice, Sam.
- You sold us out.

29:52.835 --> 29:55.796
- You think this was my decision?
- You could have told me!

29:55.879 --> 29:59.383
You know how it works. You spent
most of your adult life in secrecy.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.760
- That was different!
- It's the same.

30:01.844 --> 30:03.887
- No!
- It's exactly the same!

30:16.275 --> 30:18.569
The population was unsustainable.

30:18.652 --> 30:23.782
Without drastic measures, the Aschen
didn't think we were worth investing in.

30:24.491 --> 30:27.661
They went too far,
but I can't believe it's deliberate.

30:27.786 --> 30:32.416
- They must have a reverse procedure.
- You still don't get it.

30:32.541 --> 30:36.211
The Goa'uld would have wiped us out.
Would you prefer that?

30:36.336 --> 30:38.881
The Aschen way is slower. That's all.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.608
They're not limiting growth, they're...

30:58.775 --> 31:02.196
I... have to talk to the president. I...

31:02.279 --> 31:04.323
Yes, you do.

31:05.491 --> 31:07.534
But not about this.

31:20.172 --> 31:25.385
I need you to exchange this iris remote
with the one on the president's desk.

31:25.469 --> 31:28.347
Bring the other one back to my lab.

31:28.430 --> 31:31.934
- I need you to do it first thing tomorrow.
- How am I gonna do that?

31:32.017 --> 31:35.020
Just come up with some excuse.
I don't care.

31:35.479 --> 31:41.318
But you can't say one word about what
we've talked about, or they will kill you.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.963
Is it hot in here?

32:01.588 --> 32:04.132
This is a real-time
representation of the sun,...

32:04.258 --> 32:07.261
..recorded by Aschen satellites
all over the solar system.

32:07.344 --> 32:09.638
How do you use it to predict a solar flare?

32:09.763 --> 32:14.643
I've studied Aschen knowledge of solar
dynamics for the Jupiter ignition project.

32:14.726 --> 32:18.564
There are significant changes just
beneath the surface preceding a flare...

32:18.689 --> 32:21.692
..that are detectable by the satellite net.

32:21.775 --> 32:27.531
Look here. If my calculations are correct,
there should be a flare in five seconds.

32:39.710 --> 32:41.044
That's it.

32:41.128 --> 32:45.132
Now all we need is for the computer
to predict another flare.

32:45.215 --> 32:48.302
- Got your travel papers for Chulak?
- Yeah, all set.

32:48.385 --> 32:51.013
Give this to Teal'c.
It's the coordinates he'll need.

32:51.096 --> 32:53.140
Joe's here.

32:58.562 --> 33:00.147
Ambassador.

33:00.647 --> 33:03.734
I knew you'd have
something to do with this.

33:03.859 --> 33:06.236
Did you get it?

33:06.320 --> 33:08.363
Yes.

33:08.489 --> 33:10.532
Thank you.

33:11.950 --> 33:15.787
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Send a message.

33:15.913 --> 33:17.873
- To who?
- To whom.

33:20.334 --> 33:22.377
Let's have it.

33:23.712 --> 33:29.343
I'll hand it over... if you give me your word
that Samantha will play no part in this.

33:30.928 --> 33:32.095
I can't do that.

33:32.221 --> 33:35.557
It's in a briefcase at the customs office
at Stargate Terminal.

33:35.682 --> 33:40.896
They've been instructed not to release it
without my authorisation. Your word.

33:41.688 --> 33:44.149
We need her to pull this off.

33:45.359 --> 33:48.529
Whatever it is,
you'll have to do it without Sam.

33:49.029 --> 33:51.323
- Joe...
- This is not negotiable.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.244
If you won't say what's going on, fine.

33:55.369 --> 33:58.455
But if it involves GDOs,
then it involves the Stargate.

33:58.539 --> 34:03.669
And that terminal's the last
heavily defended place on this planet.

34:03.752 --> 34:05.879
I will not let you risk Sam's life.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.424
OK.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.806
You won't have backup.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.934
We won't need it.

34:23.856 --> 34:26.315
Uh... the sun's beeping.

34:32.697 --> 34:36.201
We have a flare prediction,
57 minutes from now.

34:37.369 --> 34:39.329
Is that enough time?

34:39.454 --> 34:41.331
It'll have to do.

35:02.644 --> 35:04.688
Thank you.

35:04.771 --> 35:09.151
If you can manage, just give us
enough time to get away from here.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.905
The message goes in six minutes.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.243
Sam wanted me to wish you luck.

35:18.327 --> 35:20.370
Give her my best.

35:46.313 --> 35:51.276
(announcer) Outgoing travellers to
Chulak, stand by in the departure area.

36:32.568 --> 36:35.445
- All right, let's go.
- I'm staying. You go if you want to.

36:35.529 --> 36:37.906
- Come on, Sam, we gotta go.
- Joe, don't.

36:38.031 --> 36:40.492
Sam, listen, we'll work this out, all right?

36:40.576 --> 36:43.328
But now it's best for both of us
if we're very far away.

36:43.412 --> 36:46.832
If they manage to do this,
it will not matter where we are.

37:00.095 --> 37:02.306
- Colonel O'Neill?
- Melon.

37:03.348 --> 37:05.392
- Mollem.
- Mollem. I'm sorry.

37:05.517 --> 37:08.061
It's... the war, you know?

37:09.354 --> 37:11.982
You didn't come to
the anniversary celebration.

37:12.065 --> 37:14.776
What's to celebrate, I say.

37:14.860 --> 37:19.656
Surely the Aschen have proven
your earlier misgivings erroneous.

37:19.781 --> 37:24.161
- For all we've done.
- Yes, you've certainly... done your part.

37:25.871 --> 37:27.748
What brings you here?

37:28.373 --> 37:30.250
Um...

37:30.751 --> 37:33.629
Well, you know my friend, Teal'c.

37:33.712 --> 37:39.176
I missed him at the celebration.
He's comin' to town. I... bought him a hat.

37:41.720 --> 37:47.142
(announcer) lncoming travellers from
Chulak. Stand clear ofthe arrival area.

37:47.226 --> 37:49.269
Right on time.

38:00.948 --> 38:04.034
I'm sorry, sir,
but weapons are not allowed.

38:04.952 --> 38:06.912
(beeping)

38:07.037 --> 38:12.334
It's just archaeological equipment.
This happens every time.

38:12.668 --> 38:14.962
We carry these for ceremonial purposes.

38:15.045 --> 38:17.756
I'm sorry, but you'll have to let me have it.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.174
Very well.

38:23.804 --> 38:26.557
- What's happening?
- (announcer) Terrorist attack.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.060
Please evacuate
the building immediately.

38:34.356 --> 38:38.360
Terrorist attack in progress.
Please evacuate immediately.

39:10.350 --> 39:11.768
Sam! Sam!

40:18.377 --> 40:22.464
Shut down the system!
I'm the Confederation Ambassador!

40:34.893 --> 40:36.603
No!

40:51.160 --> 40:53.370
Incoming traveller.

40:53.495 --> 40:55.539
- Who is it?
- It's...

40:56.248 --> 40:58.292
..SG-1 , sir.

40:59.042 --> 41:01.587
- (O'Neill) Hello.
- How can that be?

41:01.712 --> 41:04.882
Let's find out. Defence team stand by.

41:05.507 --> 41:07.551
Open the iris.

41:36.788 --> 41:38.832
Stand down.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.592
What is it?

41:59.561 --> 42:02.481
- Well?
- You tell me.

42:04.691 --> 42:09.404
"Under no circumstances go to P4C-970.
Colonel Jack O'Neill."

42:10.572 --> 42:14.576
- That looks like your handwriting.
- It is my handwriting.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.913
- And it's my signature.
- Though you sent no such note?

42:17.996 --> 42:20.457
- No.
- Sir, may l?

42:26.004 --> 42:29.508
- That looks like blood, sir.
- Have it analysed.

42:31.552 --> 42:34.096
General, wasn't 970 on our mission list?

42:34.221 --> 42:37.474
It was. Not any more.
I'm not taking any chances.

42:37.558 --> 42:41.770
I want P4C-970 removed from
the dialling computer immediately.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.897
Dismissed.

42:45.732 --> 42:48.026
I wonder why you sent it.

42:48.944 --> 42:50.988
I wonder when.

42:52.447 --> 42:55.117
Yeah. Gotta wonder.
