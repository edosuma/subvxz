WEBVTT

00:32.400 --> 00:33.880
Malcolm.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.760
Morning, James.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.280
There you are. Thanks.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.360
Morning, James. Morning.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.360
HE PANTS

01:13.920 --> 01:16.920
DOOR OPENS
Hen, I'm home.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.840
All that money on veterinary
college.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.040
It's all these trucks
and motorcars now.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.200
No-one's got need of vets any more.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.480
Thanks, Mother.
Och, something'll come along.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.040
And what if it doesn't?
LETTERBOX RATTLES

01:37.200 --> 01:40.840
I'll go, Dad. No, son. You sit and
eat your breakfast.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.240
Your father's had a word.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.160
I don't want to work on the docks.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.520
You should be
thanking your lucky stars.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.840
Men are queuing
on the streets, begging for work.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.800
I know it can't go on forever.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.480
It's good to dream.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.880
But it's also good to wake up again,

01:56.880 --> 01:59.760
and see the world as it truly is.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.160
Postman missed one.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.480
You know your father wanted to be
a professional musician?

02:05.480 --> 02:08.680
His bread and butter was the cinema.
And then the talkies come along,

02:08.680 --> 02:10.160
and then it's all up the swanny xxx.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.680
I don't mean to be cruel.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.480
We just worry, love.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.800
I got an interview.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.600
You did? You didn't!

02:21.320 --> 02:24.040
Darrowby? Yorkshire?

02:25.080 --> 02:28.000
What if it's like the others?
No job at the end of it?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.880
They're not going to have me go all
the way to Yorkshire for no reason.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.520
There was no mention of a wage
in that letter either.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.760
He is better off at the docks,

02:34.760 --> 02:36.640
and that's all I'll say about it.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.640
Best get a move on,
if you're going to catch it.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.880
MAN: Train for Yorkshire's about
to depart.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.720
Just don't be disappointed

02:47.720 --> 02:51.200
if there's not a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.920
Bye, Don, you be good.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.280
I'll probably be home tomorrow
anyway.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.560
Hold up. You're wonky.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.280
You know I only took that job
on the docks

03:02.280 --> 03:05.080
to see us through the lean times.
You've got a dream.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.720
You've got to chase it.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.320
Thanks, Dad.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.960
Cheese and pickle.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.800
Here's your ticket.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.280
Now, get on before you miss it.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.080
WHISTLE BLOWS

03:23.000 --> 03:25.400
Bye, Mother.
Good luck, son.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.840
You got a bit of grit in your eye?

03:51.640 --> 03:53.880
Oh, I hope to God he gets it.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.360
Waste of bloody time.

04:31.360 --> 04:35.240
You won't learn owt in there
you can't learn out there.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.840
Darrowby.
What was that? Did he say Darrowby?

04:54.840 --> 04:57.280
Aye, Darrowby.

04:58.680 --> 05:02.640
Jenny. Sit yourself down, don't push
past. Sorry.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.840
Little terror always wants to
go at the back.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.320
Oh, Meccano. I think you dropped
this.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.560
Thanks. I like building bridges
the best. Thank you.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.320
On or off? Er, I'm getting off.
Thanks.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.880
Excuse me. This is Darrowby,
isn't it?

05:56.880 --> 05:58.080
Darrowby? Nay.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.000
You want t'bus for Darrowby.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.640
The bus FOR Darrowby.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.560
You don't half talk funny.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.600
When's the next one? I need to be
in Darrowby before four.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
No more buses till tonight.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.280
RAIN LASHES DOWN

07:23.560 --> 07:26.680
Oh, hello. Mr Herriot?
Yes, sorry I'm late.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.640
I'd almost given up on you.
I'm Mrs Hall, I keep

07:29.640 --> 07:31.560
house for Mr Farnon.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.840
Oh, do take care of my Saint Nick.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.200
What happened to you?
You're drenched.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.400
I missed the bus...
I got off the bus.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.480
Hello. Hi.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.960
Oh, she likes you,
that's a good start.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.320
Jess is suspicious of most men.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.080
Rightly so, too.

07:57.080 --> 08:03.360
You can wait in here. I'll make
some tea and fetch Mr Farnon.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.760
DOOR CLOSES
Mrs Hall, where is the blasted
thing?

08:08.760 --> 08:09.920
One moment.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.120
Pencil.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.760
Pencil. Pencil. Quickly now,
we haven't got all day.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.760
Thank you.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.840
One down, God knows how many to go.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.360
I'm sorry, who are you?

08:24.360 --> 08:27.920
Ah, I see you've met already.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.640
This is Mr Herriot.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.320
Yes, of course.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.480
And why are you here exactly?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.680
I... You invited me, Mr Farnon.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.560
Did I? Mm-hm.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.120
For the assistant job.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.160
Excuse us a moment.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.240
We agreed there'd be no more.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.960
He's travelled
all the way from Glasgow.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.600
I don't give a damn how far he's
come, he can just go back again.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.640
Well, you can tell him that, then.
Is he even qualified?

08:56.640 --> 08:58.840
Nine months ago.
What's his name?

08:58.840 --> 08:59.800
James Herriot.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.760
Give the boy a chance.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.640
Mr Herriot, I'm Farnon. Siegfried.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.560
Don't ask. I'm James.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.960
Thank you for this opportunity.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.680
Yes, well, let's see how we
rub along first, shall we? Jacket?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.120
You're wearing it. Job list?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.160
Pocket.

09:19.440 --> 09:23.040
Will you not stop for tea? I don't
care how he takes his Darjeeling,

09:23.040 --> 09:24.480
I want to know if he's up to the
work.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.360
Come along, Herriot,
don't just stand there.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.840
Are we not...? I thought this would
be an interview. I've got my

09:28.840 --> 09:31.400
references from the Principal of
Glasgow Veterinary College.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.960
No, I'm not interested in a lot of
flannel. Let's get cracking.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.280
Until this evening, Mrs Hall.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.600
Good luck. Grab that.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.160
Cat.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.320
In the box. The box, man!

09:45.360 --> 09:46.680
CAT MEOWS

09:46.680 --> 09:47.760
Dispensary.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.360
Oh, emasculator.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.440
That's the Burdizzo.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.120
Enough to bring tears to your eyes.
Come on.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.440
This is Mrs Hall's domain.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.640
Cooks a mean black pudding.
Makes it herself, you know.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.840
Place looks like an abattoir
afterwards.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.560
CAT MEOWS

10:22.120 --> 10:24.280
This is the animal shed.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.320
You'll take care of feeding them,
morning and night.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.000
If successful, of course.

10:35.520 --> 10:36.720
Good.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.080
Shut the door.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.320
Our practice covers
most of the Northern Dales -

10:40.320 --> 10:43.880
Swaledale, Wensleydale -
so you'll need your own car.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.400
Beauty, isn't she?
Stunning.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.920
We keep this spare
for the assistant.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.960
Good little runner.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.680
Aye, she looks...grand.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.400
Right, let's see what you're made
of, shall we?

11:15.240 --> 11:16.960
Best foot forward.

12:14.957 --> 12:17.557
Walk on. That'll do.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.677
Farnon.

12:33.037 --> 12:36.237
The majority of our work
comes from the smallholdings.

12:36.237 --> 12:40.477
We do get the occasional small
animal, cats, dogs.

12:40.477 --> 12:42.077
Look at that!

12:42.077 --> 12:44.717
Shorthorn cow, you see?

12:44.717 --> 12:46.517
Gorgeous beast.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.477
Dying out now, of course.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.397
Friesians give so much more milk.

12:50.397 --> 12:52.277
As much as eight quarts per day.

12:52.277 --> 12:54.197
And you think that's a good thing,
do you?

12:54.197 --> 12:55.837
If a farmer can get more milk for

12:55.837 --> 12:59.797
the same amount of effort, I suppose
it is. You suppose? I mean...

12:59.797 --> 13:00.917
But at what cost?

13:02.197 --> 13:03.877
This place has a character
all of its own.

13:03.877 --> 13:06.437
The Shorthorns are a part of that.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.397
With them gone, the Dales lose

13:08.397 --> 13:11.277
a little more of what makes them
so special.

13:17.557 --> 13:21.877
So, where did it all start for you,
wanting to be a vet?

13:21.877 --> 13:24.877
There was a-a small city farm
at the back of my school.

13:24.877 --> 13:28.157
It was like having
part of the country in the city.

13:28.157 --> 13:30.477
I developed a real
love for the animals there.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.637
Ah, well, you see,

13:32.637 --> 13:34.797
the animals are the easy part.

13:36.277 --> 13:38.277
It's the people
cause all the bother.

13:51.357 --> 13:53.837
How do, Mr Farnon?
How do you do, Mr Sharpe?

13:53.837 --> 13:56.037
This is Herriot. New assistant,
possibly.

13:56.037 --> 13:57.917
Oh, aye, another one.

13:57.917 --> 14:01.117
He had me worried, I thought
t'bank were coming for me.

14:01.117 --> 14:02.357
What seems to be the trouble?

14:02.357 --> 14:04.317
I've got a gelding gone
wrong in 'oof.

14:04.317 --> 14:07.237
Well, we certainly don't want that.

14:07.237 --> 14:10.557
Is he foreign? I'm from Glasgow.
Scotland.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.877
It's that dark one over there. Yes.

14:15.717 --> 14:18.437
Well? Which foot is it?

14:18.437 --> 14:20.077
Well, I'd need to see him walk.

14:21.317 --> 14:22.837
Dealt with many horses before?

14:22.837 --> 14:24.997
Yes, lots. At veterinary college.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.037
What about in the real world?

14:27.037 --> 14:28.917
This'll be my first.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.477
Hold your coat for you?

14:41.637 --> 14:46.077
From the way he's holding his head,
I'd say it was the offside fore.

14:48.197 --> 14:49.197
Good.

14:52.117 --> 14:54.917
Right, let's have a look
at this hoof.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.397
WHINNYING

15:31.477 --> 15:33.797
I'm sorry, young man,
I ought to have told you,

15:33.797 --> 15:35.197
it's a very friendly horse.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.517
He always likes to shake hands.

15:40.157 --> 15:42.397
No, no, I'd like to continue.

16:05.557 --> 16:07.117
Easy, boy. Easy.

16:07.117 --> 16:09.597
Steady down, boy. Steady down.

16:11.157 --> 16:12.157
That's it.

16:12.157 --> 16:14.077
You carry on, young man.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.917
Knife, please.

16:23.837 --> 16:25.117
Thanks.

16:37.637 --> 16:41.117
Looks like pus in the foot.
Ah. Easy!

16:43.277 --> 16:45.477
HORSE WHINNIES
Got it!

16:49.077 --> 16:50.117
Wait.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.597
Now to disinfect the wound.

16:56.277 --> 16:57.877
A touch of iodine.

17:03.837 --> 17:05.477
A dash of turpentine.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.277
By God, Mr Farnon!

17:13.277 --> 17:16.837
It's wonderful what science can do
these days.

17:17.877 --> 17:21.277
What shall we say to that, ten bob?
Aye. Aye.

17:31.557 --> 17:34.037
HE WHISTLES A HAPPY TUNE

17:40.237 --> 17:42.477
Let's go back a different way.

17:42.477 --> 17:46.877
Over the Brenkstone Pass and down
Sildale. I'd like you to see it.

17:46.877 --> 17:49.397
I've never used iodine
in that way before.

17:49.397 --> 17:53.237
Is it a new remedy? Oh, it has no
practical purpose whatsoever,

17:53.237 --> 17:54.517
but it never fails to impress.

17:54.517 --> 17:57.437
Makes them feel they're
getting their money's worth.

17:57.437 --> 17:59.077
Time to earn your wings.

18:15.317 --> 18:17.557
I didn't expect it
to be so beautiful.

18:17.557 --> 18:19.477
One of the wildest spots in England.

18:19.477 --> 18:22.277
It's a fearsome place in winter,
I tell you.

18:22.277 --> 18:23.477
It's marvellous.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.437
You won't be saying that
when the snow's 8ft deep.

18:26.437 --> 18:29.157
I've known this pass to be blocked
for weeks on end.

18:29.157 --> 18:31.517
I'll be sure to keep
a shovel with me.

18:31.517 --> 18:33.677
That's Hodden Hill ahead.

18:33.677 --> 18:37.957
You need to keep your speed up or
you won't make it up the other side.

18:42.637 --> 18:44.237
PEDAL RATTLES

18:44.237 --> 18:45.957
The brakes don't work!

18:45.957 --> 18:48.117
That happens from time to time.

18:48.117 --> 18:51.117
They're consistently inconsistent.
How am I supposed to slow down?!

18:51.117 --> 18:53.957
Why would you want to? We want to go
faster, Herriot, not slower.

18:53.957 --> 18:55.117
Faster!

18:57.037 --> 18:59.437
Have faith in yourself.
Keep your foot on it.

19:04.637 --> 19:06.237
I can't!

19:06.237 --> 19:08.037
SCREECHING

19:09.037 --> 19:10.437
Oh.

19:15.437 --> 19:17.157
Oh, dear.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.797
Shall I get out and push?

19:22.197 --> 19:24.637
CHURCH BELL CHIMES

19:30.837 --> 19:32.477
Oh, you're back.

19:32.477 --> 19:34.677
Good day?
Not over yet.

19:54.797 --> 19:58.637
He was lying on the ground,
covered in muck, and I says to him,

19:58.637 --> 20:00.877
"He always likes to shake hands."

20:00.877 --> 20:02.157
Farnon.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.717
How do, Mr Farnon?

20:04.717 --> 20:06.117
Evening, Nick.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.117
Two ales, please, Joe.

20:08.117 --> 20:09.877
You found your way all right, then,
lad?

20:09.877 --> 20:11.837
I did, thank you.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.277
Here, Farnon.

20:13.277 --> 20:15.957
Lady of the house wants to know
what's to do with this cat of hers.

20:15.957 --> 20:18.597
Ask her to come into surgery
tomorrow to pick him up.

20:18.597 --> 20:21.277
Oh, and I've got a sow
I wanted to talk to you about.

20:21.277 --> 20:24.237
Yes, yes, Henry, just give me
a moment to wet my whistle.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.157
Your very good health.

20:33.157 --> 20:39.197
Now, about this sow of mine,
seven piglets, all good an' healthy

20:39.197 --> 20:42.197
but runt of the litter, he's not
getting a look in, poor sod.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.797
Ah, well, now,
that's a very common problem.

20:44.797 --> 20:47.397
And one which will have to wait.

20:47.397 --> 20:49.597
If I allow them to think I'm at
their beck and call,

20:49.597 --> 20:50.757
I'll never stop.

20:53.117 --> 20:58.717
'Ere, Farnon, got Heifer going on
three cylinders - wants seeing to.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.957
Yes, Mr Handshaw, I'll be up
first thing tomorrow morning.

21:01.957 --> 21:04.677
No matter, then, I'll go see
George Pandhi.

21:04.677 --> 21:07.837
He's always happy to come out,
see us animals.

21:07.837 --> 21:10.037
Well,
that's certainly your prerogative.

21:10.037 --> 21:13.477
He's a perfectly adequate
substitute. Yeah.

21:14.557 --> 21:16.317
Hold on, Dennis. Here.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.477
What about my pigs?

21:17.477 --> 21:21.237
Erm, perhaps you could direct
your questions to my new assistant.

21:23.037 --> 21:26.237
Your assistant?
You mean I've got the job?

21:26.237 --> 21:28.557
How does four quid a week
and full board sound?

21:28.557 --> 21:32.077
It sounds great. I mean, thank you.

21:32.077 --> 21:34.317
Trial period only, mind you.
Of course.

21:36.077 --> 21:37.637
These gentlemen'll look after you.

21:37.637 --> 21:39.917
You all right finding your own
way home?

21:39.917 --> 21:41.477
Good.

21:42.597 --> 21:46.157
Now, let's us have us another,

21:46.157 --> 21:48.197
then we'll get to this pig of mine.

21:48.197 --> 21:50.757
They got your brew on tonight,
haven't they, Sharpe?

21:50.757 --> 21:54.237
Oh, aye, puts hairs on your chest,
if you're up to it.

21:54.237 --> 21:55.437
Not like that gnat's piss.

21:55.437 --> 21:57.957
I shouldn't, really,
I want a clear head tomorrow.

21:57.957 --> 22:01.437
Probably for the best, it's a drink
for Yorkshiremen, in't it?

22:01.437 --> 22:03.597
Aye. Aye. Not for city folk.

22:05.837 --> 22:07.997
Och, where's the harm in one?

22:11.917 --> 22:15.837
BANGING AND CLATTERING

22:55.997 --> 22:58.917
Mr Herriot,
what on Earth are you doing?

22:58.917 --> 23:01.357
Feeding the cats.

23:01.357 --> 23:03.197
I got the job.

23:03.197 --> 23:05.757
How much did you have?
Only two.

23:05.757 --> 23:10.037
Mr Sharpe was kind enough
to let me sample his home brew.

23:12.037 --> 23:13.477
On your feet.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.157
If Mr Farnon wakes up

23:15.157 --> 23:17.517
and catches you in this state,
you'll be out on your ear.

23:17.517 --> 23:20.117
Now, put them back, quickly.

23:34.276 --> 23:37.116
EASY-LISTENING MUSIC PLAYS

23:43.436 --> 23:45.636
No sign of Rip Van Winkle?

23:45.636 --> 23:49.996
I expect he's tired from all that
travelling yesterday.

24:02.196 --> 24:04.596
THUMPS CEILING

24:24.356 --> 24:26.876
Morning, Mrs Hall, Mr Farnon.

24:26.876 --> 24:31.516
Morning, James. I hope you slept
comfortably. Very much so.

24:36.316 --> 24:37.556
Thank you.

24:39.476 --> 24:41.636
Stay long at the Drovers last night?

24:41.636 --> 24:44.436
Only for a couple.
Get to know the locals, you know?

24:44.436 --> 24:46.676
And did you? Did I what?

24:46.676 --> 24:49.676
Get to know them. Who?

24:49.676 --> 24:51.236
The locals?

24:51.236 --> 24:52.796
The locals?

24:54.036 --> 24:57.676
Oh, YES, yes, I was.
But I did, I think.

24:58.836 --> 25:00.276
Sorry, what was the question?

25:00.276 --> 25:02.116
Poor boy's barely woken up.

25:02.116 --> 25:03.756
Coffee?

25:03.756 --> 25:06.436
I don't usually actually take...
HE CLEARS THROAT

25:06.436 --> 25:09.956
Something the matter? No, er, no.

25:09.956 --> 25:13.196
It looks...
There's just so much of it.

25:15.236 --> 25:18.036
It's not the mountain we conquer,
but ourselves.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.956
What's this about Henry's pig?
Henry's...?

25:21.956 --> 25:23.236
Mr Dinsdale.

25:23.236 --> 25:27.596
You spoke with him last night.
Ah, yes. Yes.

25:27.596 --> 25:29.356
He...he has a pig that...well,

25:29.356 --> 25:31.276
it's a...it's a little confusing,

25:31.276 --> 25:33.996
actually, he HAD a pig that was...

25:35.356 --> 25:38.356
Really, James, these people are
our valued customers -

25:38.356 --> 25:41.076
if you can't remember...
Perhaps the inquisition can wait

25:41.076 --> 25:43.916
until after Mr Herriot's
finished his breakfast. The runt.

25:45.636 --> 25:49.156
I advised him to remove the others
to give the little one a chance.

25:49.156 --> 25:53.596
And if that didn't work, then bottle
feeding would be the only way.

25:58.356 --> 26:00.876
Well, we best be getting on.
We've got a full list.

26:02.756 --> 26:05.516
Got to see the Aldersons,
calf trouble.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.396
Just try
and make it through the day.

26:28.876 --> 26:31.396
What on Earth are you doing?
You're missing the turning.

26:31.396 --> 26:33.596
You said you were going to tell me
when it was coming up!

26:33.596 --> 26:36.676
I just did. Weren't you listening?
But...

26:36.676 --> 26:39.276
Yes, Mr Farnon. Sorry.

26:45.796 --> 26:47.596
There.

27:08.076 --> 27:09.996
HE BEEPS HORN

27:45.156 --> 27:48.756
Just enjoying the view. See if you
can find Alderson. I'll follow.

27:52.396 --> 27:54.316
CLUCKING

27:54.316 --> 27:55.956
Hello?

27:58.316 --> 27:59.756
Hello?

27:59.756 --> 28:03.356
DONKEY BRAYS

28:03.356 --> 28:08.756
Mr Alderson? Mr Alderson?

28:17.956 --> 28:19.396
BELLOWING

28:19.396 --> 28:20.436
Oh, God.

28:23.316 --> 28:24.876
Good boy.

28:27.596 --> 28:29.036
Good lad.

28:32.196 --> 28:34.476
Oh, bugger this.

28:40.876 --> 28:43.076
Go on, get.

28:43.076 --> 28:44.756
Oh.

28:45.876 --> 28:48.516
Hold this one for me.

28:48.516 --> 28:50.756
Thanks.

28:50.756 --> 28:55.356
Come here, you. Come here.

29:01.236 --> 29:03.396
That's it.

29:04.356 --> 29:05.556
Thanks.

29:07.716 --> 29:09.756
Just don't look him in the eye.

29:22.716 --> 29:23.996
That's them sorted.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.556
Sorry about Clive, he's a miserable
devil at the best of times.

29:27.556 --> 29:28.876
Who's Clive?

29:28.876 --> 29:33.596
This one. Need a hand down?

29:33.596 --> 29:35.356
No, I can manage.

29:37.516 --> 29:41.276
I'm Helen.
Herriot, James Herriot.

29:41.276 --> 29:43.116
Mr Farnon's new assistant.

29:43.116 --> 29:45.356
Oh, another one.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.436
Calf's in the top field.

30:02.396 --> 30:06.036
Jenny. Get yourself up to the house,
your homework needs doing.

30:06.036 --> 30:09.116
I swear she's like a sheep dog,
but with half the sense.

30:09.116 --> 30:12.476
MY mother used to despair
at my mucking about with animals.

30:12.476 --> 30:13.716
Still does.

30:13.716 --> 30:14.876
She's my sister.

30:17.596 --> 30:18.916
How old is she now?

30:18.916 --> 30:22.556
12. I swear I've aged
two for every one of hers.

30:22.556 --> 30:24.396
Oh, I'm sure she'll appreciate

30:24.396 --> 30:26.876
everything you've done
when she's older.

30:26.876 --> 30:29.356
We can live in hope,
can't we, Siegfried?

30:29.356 --> 30:31.756
Your father faring well?

30:31.756 --> 30:34.196
He never stops.
Much as I want him to.

30:41.156 --> 30:43.716
That's good.
Keep hold of her neck, please?

30:43.716 --> 30:46.076
Good girl, there, settle down.

30:46.076 --> 30:47.956
He's here to look after you.

30:49.076 --> 30:51.636
Clean fracture
of the metacarpal bone,

30:51.636 --> 30:54.676
but there's very little
displacement.

30:54.676 --> 30:57.036
And what do you suggest we do
about it?

30:58.836 --> 31:02.716
It should do well with
a plaster cast...I think. You think?

31:02.716 --> 31:05.556
No, I know.
You're not going to use a splint?

31:05.556 --> 31:08.436
The plaster cast should be
sufficient to hold it in alignment.

31:08.436 --> 31:10.116
Should? It will be.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.236
Very good. Carry on.

31:19.196 --> 31:22.396
Don't worry,
we're here now.

31:22.396 --> 31:24.556
We're going to look after her.

31:28.196 --> 31:29.956
WHISPERS: Other leg.

31:35.756 --> 31:38.476
I'll be back to see you soon...
to see the calf.

31:38.476 --> 31:40.996
To remove
the cast from its leg.

31:40.996 --> 31:42.836
In a couple of months. Weeks.

31:42.836 --> 31:44.756
CAR HORN BEEPS

31:44.756 --> 31:47.236
I better go.
It was nice meeting you.

31:47.236 --> 31:49.476
You too. Wait. James.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.476
Siegfried's bark really is worse
than his bite.

31:54.476 --> 31:56.156
He's been very kind to us.

31:56.156 --> 31:58.436
Underneath it all, he's a good man.

31:58.436 --> 32:00.596
CAR HORN

32:00.596 --> 32:02.196
Stand up to him.

32:02.196 --> 32:03.676
He'll love you for it.

32:08.156 --> 32:09.356
Chop chop.

32:22.116 --> 32:24.276
Mrs Dinsdale? Yes. Here for Jaspar?

32:24.276 --> 32:27.756
Mm-hm. If you'd like to wait
in here, I'll fetch your cat.

32:27.756 --> 32:31.236
Could you grab Leo for me
while you're at it?

32:48.796 --> 32:50.316
OK, Leo.

32:56.956 --> 32:59.116
And... Jaspar.

33:11.956 --> 33:14.836
Ah, Herriot. Thank you.

33:16.996 --> 33:20.436
What's the operation? Oh, a simple
castration. Nothing major.

33:28.516 --> 33:30.396
What's that, then?

33:31.476 --> 33:33.396
Jaspar. Your cat.

33:33.396 --> 33:34.636
No, it isn't.

33:34.636 --> 33:36.436
Are you sure?

33:36.436 --> 33:39.516
You think
I wouldn't know me own cat?

33:43.756 --> 33:46.756
Sorry, Mrs Hall, would you mind?

33:46.756 --> 33:50.116
James? It's the wrong cat.
I don't understand,

33:50.116 --> 33:53.476
it said "Jaspar" on the cage.
I know it did, so how can it be?

33:53.476 --> 33:56.636
Maybe because you came home
soused last night.

33:57.556 --> 33:59.836
I put them back in the wrong cages.

33:59.836 --> 34:02.356
Please don't say anything.

34:02.356 --> 34:04.236
PHONE RINGS

34:06.876 --> 34:09.116
Darrowby 2-2-9-7?

34:16.316 --> 34:17.916
I'll have someone call you today.

34:17.916 --> 34:19.836
Apologies for the delay,
Mrs Dinsdale.

34:19.836 --> 34:23.036
Now, the good news,
Jaspar's mange has cleared up,

34:23.036 --> 34:24.716
and you can take him home today.

34:24.716 --> 34:26.276
Bad news, it'll be a half a crown.

34:26.276 --> 34:27.876
That's not my cat neither.

34:27.876 --> 34:30.036
You're sure? Am I sure?!

34:30.036 --> 34:31.876
It's the wrong colour, for starters.

34:31.876 --> 34:34.156
And what would be the right colour?

34:34.156 --> 34:35.716
He's a ginger. Oh, God.

34:38.636 --> 34:42.916
Sorry. James, slow down, take a deep
breath.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.116
Stop, that's the wrong cat.

34:45.116 --> 34:47.796
What you talking about? This is the
cat you gave me. It's Jaspar.

34:47.796 --> 34:50.276
I asked for Leo.
I thought he was.

34:50.276 --> 34:52.076
My cat!

34:53.076 --> 34:54.476
You've killed him.

34:54.476 --> 34:56.196
He's not dead. Merely chloroformed.

34:56.196 --> 34:59.436
Mrs Dinsdale, perhaps you could wait
in the hall.

34:59.436 --> 35:03.676
You've drugged him. My baby.
You've drugged my cat!

35:03.676 --> 35:06.436
For the love of God, would someone
tell me what the hell is going on?!

35:06.436 --> 35:08.756
It was my fault. It's was more than
likely, I should say.

35:08.756 --> 35:10.956
It was just a simple
administrative error.

35:10.956 --> 35:12.516
I put them back in the wrong cages.

35:12.516 --> 35:15.116
Really, Herriot? How could you make
such a fundamental mistake?

35:15.116 --> 35:17.756
Because he was bloody pie-eyed,
I shouldn't imagine.

35:17.756 --> 35:20.156
Well, that's how my Henry tells it.

35:20.156 --> 35:22.836
What? You were drunk?

35:31.476 --> 35:34.716
Looks like it's me and you
in the doghouse, Jess.

36:05.716 --> 36:07.756
CLOCK CHIMES
What's wrong? Why can't I have that?

36:07.756 --> 36:10.356
Because it's not one word
and it's spelt differently.

36:10.356 --> 36:11.676
Yes, yes, apart from that.

36:19.396 --> 36:21.876
You know, he were only
feeding the cats

36:21.876 --> 36:25.236
because he wanted to do a good job.
It was a silly mistake.

36:25.236 --> 36:28.076
These people trust us
with their animals.

36:28.076 --> 36:30.636
For the farmers,
it's their livelihood.

36:30.636 --> 36:33.436
I can't afford a repeat of what
happened today.

36:33.436 --> 36:36.956
So you propose to keep running
this place by yourself?

36:36.956 --> 36:39.196
I've managed perfectly
well on my own so far.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.116
You weren't always on your own.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.476
Even if that's
what you've got used to.

36:43.476 --> 36:45.156
Are you going to take your turn?

36:45.156 --> 36:47.836
It's wearing you down.
Well, that's my business, isn't it?

36:47.836 --> 36:49.836
And what about the people who care
about you?

36:49.836 --> 36:51.676
Are we playing this blasted game
or not?

36:51.676 --> 36:53.556
You never stop.
You're always on the go.

36:53.556 --> 36:55.356
You'll run yourself
into an early grave.

36:55.356 --> 36:58.516
I think I've a few good years before
they put me out to pasture.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.236
One mistake.

37:01.916 --> 37:06.756
He's a good boy, taking his first
steps in the working world.

37:06.756 --> 37:10.796
You must remember what that
were like, how hard it was?

37:13.676 --> 37:16.116
It's just someone else for me
to worry about.

37:16.116 --> 37:19.876
You can't say I haven't tried.
What is he - the fifth? The sixth?

37:19.876 --> 37:22.676
You never gave any of them
a fair crack of the whip.

37:22.676 --> 37:28.076
In fact, I might even go so far
as to suggest you spiked his guns.

37:28.076 --> 37:30.836
I have no idea what you're talking
about. You led a horse to water,

37:30.836 --> 37:33.436
knowing full well Sharpe
and Dinsdale would see he drank it.

37:33.436 --> 37:34.836
That's an absurd suggestion.

37:34.836 --> 37:37.516
I know you're the patron saint
of lost causes but, really...

37:37.516 --> 37:39.876
And what exactly is that
supposed to mean?

37:39.876 --> 37:43.556
That you care about people who...
who sometimes don't deserve it.

37:43.556 --> 37:44.996
Oh, on that we must agree.

37:54.196 --> 37:57.196
He's a good lad.
I don't doubt it.

37:57.196 --> 37:59.476
But I'm afraid he still has to go.

38:11.436 --> 38:13.436
THUNDER RUMBLES

38:19.996 --> 38:21.556
BRAKES SQUEAK

38:28.036 --> 38:29.436
BELL RINGS

38:35.636 --> 38:38.596
I'm having trouble with t'calf,
can someone come and help us?

38:38.596 --> 38:40.996
We'll get someone up
to your farm right away.

38:40.996 --> 38:42.276
Thanks so much.

38:46.276 --> 38:50.116
Dick Rudd's having trouble with
the calf. I better wake Mr Farnon.

38:50.116 --> 38:52.316
Don't. I'll go.

38:53.836 --> 38:54.916
I can do it.

38:56.356 --> 38:59.276
Mrs Hall, please.

39:01.836 --> 39:03.516
All right.

39:16.876 --> 39:19.476
I put it up for luck
when Mr Farnon goes out.

39:21.876 --> 39:23.156
Thank you.

40:13.037 --> 40:15.397
She's in here.

40:19.957 --> 40:21.197
Don't worry.

40:21.197 --> 40:22.997
He'll soon be here.

40:28.837 --> 40:31.197
You let me know
if I can get you some more light.

40:31.197 --> 40:33.677
This will do just fine,
thank you, Mr Rudd.

40:35.957 --> 40:38.357
I don't
suppose she has a name?

40:38.357 --> 40:40.877
Not as such. He calls them all
Missus.

40:40.877 --> 40:44.637
Spends more time talking with them
than he does with me.

40:44.637 --> 40:46.637
A better quality of conversation.

40:46.637 --> 40:49.317
They don't say owt. Aye.

40:49.317 --> 40:51.957
All right, there, Missus?

40:51.957 --> 40:56.277
It's all right,
we're here to look after you.

40:56.277 --> 40:58.917
We're going to get that
baby of yours out.

40:58.917 --> 41:01.357
How long has she been pushing?

41:01.357 --> 41:03.077
Five hour, thereabouts.

41:03.077 --> 41:07.317
Easy. Take it easy.
You're all right.

41:12.277 --> 41:14.117
COW WAILS

41:20.957 --> 41:25.957
The head's caught in the pelvis, I
can't bring it around to get it out.

41:31.437 --> 41:34.877
HE GRUNTS

41:34.877 --> 41:36.357
Are you all right there?

41:36.357 --> 41:38.117
She's having a contraction.

41:43.517 --> 41:45.837
It's no good. It's no good.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.677
It's not coming around.

41:52.117 --> 41:56.077
Is that it, then?
Are they...are they both done for?

41:57.277 --> 42:00.037
No, no, we keep trying.

42:01.357 --> 42:03.517
CLOCK TICKS

42:38.517 --> 42:40.037
Good morning, good morning.

42:41.957 --> 42:43.117
Mrs Hall?

42:49.717 --> 42:52.357
This is going on too long.

42:52.357 --> 42:53.717
I could fetch Farnon.

42:55.997 --> 43:00.797
He wouldn't make it in time.
Look, I don't want her to suffer.

43:00.797 --> 43:03.717
If it comes to it,
you do what you've got to do.

43:10.717 --> 43:15.637
Oh. Oh, my goodness, is James back?

43:15.637 --> 43:17.677
How do you mean? Back from where?

43:21.837 --> 43:23.797
There's one last thing we can try.

43:31.037 --> 43:34.477
I'll try to hook it around the jaw
and pull it around that way.

43:53.077 --> 43:54.917
I can't quite...

43:54.917 --> 43:57.477
HE GASPS

44:03.437 --> 44:07.157
Nearly. I can't get it.

44:11.477 --> 44:13.117
We'll try one more time.

44:19.517 --> 44:23.317
Got it! I hooked the jaw.

44:23.317 --> 44:24.637
Take the rope.

44:24.637 --> 44:25.917
Keep a gentle tension.

44:37.677 --> 44:39.157
That's it.

44:39.157 --> 44:40.397
Gently now.

44:40.397 --> 44:42.117
Gently.

44:44.237 --> 44:46.597
It's coming!

44:46.597 --> 44:48.317
I think I've got it!

44:50.917 --> 44:52.917
I think I've got it.

45:35.077 --> 45:39.397
Must've seen it a thousand times.
Never gets old.

45:42.837 --> 45:47.757
Herriot. What the devil do you think
you're playing at?

45:47.757 --> 45:49.757
He's done good, Mr Farnon.

45:49.757 --> 45:51.317
One healthy girl in there.

45:51.317 --> 45:54.437
I never gave you permission
to go out on your own. I'm sorry.

45:54.437 --> 45:55.997
But it turned out well.

46:03.877 --> 46:05.717
You were lucky.

46:05.717 --> 46:07.877
There was nothing lucky about it.

46:07.877 --> 46:10.757
I worked damned hard getting that
calf out. Yes, you seemed to have

46:10.757 --> 46:13.597
made quite the meal of it? How long
were you in there? Five hours?

46:13.597 --> 46:16.237
Has anyone told you how insufferable
you are?

46:17.597 --> 46:19.317
Not to my face, no.

46:22.517 --> 46:24.477
Thank you, Mrs Rudd.

46:27.157 --> 46:30.237
How much sleep did you get, James?
Hour? Hour and a half?

46:30.237 --> 46:31.877
None.

46:31.877 --> 46:33.877
Better get used to it.

46:35.797 --> 46:37.997
Thank you, Mr Farnon.
You won't regret it.

46:37.997 --> 46:39.637
Siegfried, please.

46:39.637 --> 46:41.437
Mr Farnon was my father.

47:16.197 --> 47:19.597
Don't brake, don't...brake.

47:31.797 --> 47:33.237
Woooooh!

47:37.397 --> 47:39.437
Woooooh!

47:49.717 --> 47:52.357
