WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:01.920
- Previously, on "Nashville"...

00:01.920 --> 00:04.290
- The smiles, the touching,
I saw it all.

00:04.290 --> 00:06.580
You think I'm an idiot?
I'm not an idiot.

00:06.580 --> 00:08.790
- Brand partnerships.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.460
The best kind of integration
is entirely frictionless.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.420
- Budweiser wants
to work with me?

00:13.420 --> 00:15.290
- Damien wants something,
Damien gets it.

00:15.290 --> 00:18.040
He's one charming guy.
He's the father, isn't he?

00:18.040 --> 00:20.040
- Excuse me?

00:20.040 --> 00:22.500
- Scarlett O'Connor
revealed that Gunnar Scott

00:22.500 --> 00:24.380
is not the father
of her baby to be.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.290
- How could you tell her
Scarlett?

00:26.290 --> 00:28.330
- I didn't tell her.
She figured it out anyway.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.120
- Oh, I'm so hungry
I could eat a dozen biscuits.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.290
- I'd like to see that.

00:34.290 --> 00:35.920
- Ha ha, yeah.

00:35.920 --> 00:36.880
- Oh, you don't think I could?

00:36.880 --> 00:38.460
- Uh-uh.
- No way.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.000
- Well, sounds like
we got us a bet here.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.380
- Bet!
- Yeah, biscuit bet. It's on.

00:41.380 --> 00:43.460
- Deacon?

00:43.460 --> 00:46.790
Diane...Harrison.

00:46.790 --> 00:50.580
I haven't seen you around this
neighborhood in so long.

00:50.580 --> 00:53.580
I am so sorry about everything.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.080
It's so good to see you out
and about with your girls.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.420
- We come here pretty often.

00:57.420 --> 01:00.460
- It's so important to get back
in the swing of things after...

01:00.460 --> 01:03.290
You have my number, right?
- Uh...

01:03.290 --> 01:05.080
- I was planning
on dropping something

01:05.080 --> 01:07.960
by the house soon anyway,
I've just been so busy.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.750
Oh, you girls are so beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.170
Just like your mama.
- Yup.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.670
Well, I will be seeing you soon.
- All right.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.540
- Who was that?

01:18.540 --> 01:20.290
- Another woman
interested in Dad.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.920
- Please tell me
you're not interested in her.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.960
- You two are the only girls
in my life, believe me.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.880
- Hi, there.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.290
- Hey, Scarlett.
How are you?

01:31.290 --> 01:34.170
- Oh, hanging in there
or pretending to hang in there.

01:34.170 --> 01:37.290
Zach told me you were
the one to fix all this.

01:37.290 --> 01:39.290
- Well, I am going to try.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.120
Actually, you must feel awful.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.880
- Well, my fans hate me.
Well, like literally hate me.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.710
- They don't hate you, okay?

01:45.710 --> 01:47.290
They had a fantasy about you.

01:47.290 --> 01:49.170
And they were shocked
to find out

01:49.170 --> 01:51.880
that you're a real person.
How dare you!

01:51.880 --> 01:54.580
- Well, I don't know
how they had a fantasy

01:54.580 --> 01:56.500
about me in the first place.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.540
- Yeah, well, that's
celebrity culture, you know.

01:58.540 --> 02:00.330
People, they are lonely.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.170
And they think their
lives are worthless.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.500
So they project all
of their wishes and dreams

02:04.500 --> 02:06.250
on the people who
they think have everything.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.540
- You know, it's that
damn Mackenzie Rhodes.

02:08.540 --> 02:10.330
I mean, how could
somebody do that?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.960
Pretend to be your friend.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.540
And then turn around and write

02:13.540 --> 02:15.380
something so personal
like that about you?

02:15.380 --> 02:17.120
- You need to steer clear
of Mackenzie Rhodes, okay?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.620
This is what she does.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.040
She worms her way
into your confidence.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.580
And then finds a way
to use it against you.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.710
If I had been here, I would not
have let you do that interview.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.750
- What do we do now?

02:25.750 --> 02:28.710
- Well, we change the narrative,
you know.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.290
She tore you down.
We're gonna build you up.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.080
- Okay. How?

02:32.080 --> 02:35.080
- Are there any causes
that you care deeply about?

02:35.080 --> 02:36.750
- Yeah, you know,
when I first moved to town,

02:36.750 --> 02:38.580
the only place I could
afford to get a pap smear

02:38.580 --> 02:40.170
was Two Rivers
Women's Health Clinic.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.790
A lot of my friends are the same

02:41.790 --> 02:43.460
there's really only
the last year and a half

02:43.460 --> 02:45.290
that I've been afford
to health insurance.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.170
And most of my friends
still can't, and I just--

02:47.170 --> 02:48.960
I really admire what
they do for people in need.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.210
- Well, you go, girl.
- (laughs)

02:51.210 --> 02:53.790
- No, I mean, would you
want to do a benefit for them?

02:53.790 --> 02:54.830
- Yeah, that would be amazing.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.790
- All right, but for now,

02:56.790 --> 02:58.880
I think that we need to reach
out directly to your fans.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.670
I was at your last show.

03:00.670 --> 03:03.120
And I saw you with those
young girls--you were amazing.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.580
That's the Scarlett we need
to put out there, okay.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.460
We do a surprise performance
with a meet and greet after.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.120
Blast it out only
on social media, no press.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.540
Just for the people
that love you.

03:11.540 --> 03:12.880
- Thank you so much.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.920
- So your truck breaks down
in the middle of nowhere.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.540
You trudge down a deserted
two-lane blacktop.

03:18.540 --> 03:20.170
And you come to a town.

03:20.170 --> 03:22.670
You're thirsty
and you come to a saloon.

03:22.670 --> 03:23.830
Which is filled with some
of the meanest-looking

03:23.830 --> 03:25.120
characters you ever saw.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.710
And they don't like you.

03:26.710 --> 03:29.120
What's gonna happen?

03:29.120 --> 03:30.920
Then the meanest-looking
guy in the bar

03:30.920 --> 03:32.790
takes a bottle of Bud,
and slides it

03:32.790 --> 03:35.120
all the way down to you
while all the mean guys watch.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.790
What's Will Lexington gonna do?

03:37.790 --> 03:39.170
You're gonna pick up
that bottle,

03:39.170 --> 03:41.080
and take the longest guzzle.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.880
And the other guys are gonna
start to smile and laugh.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.580
And smack each other
on the back.

03:44.580 --> 03:45.620
And they've decided right there:

03:45.620 --> 03:48.830
We like Will Lexington!

03:51.330 --> 03:53.920
- Our research shows
that straight men like you.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.330
They want to have
a beer with you.

03:55.330 --> 03:56.880
- And both straight
and gay women

03:56.880 --> 03:58.330
think you're definitely hot.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.750
- Well, thank you.
That's good to know.

04:00.750 --> 04:01.750
- The man in black
comes to town.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.250
And he's Will Lexington,

04:03.250 --> 04:04.880
country star, openly gay,

04:04.880 --> 04:07.120
and no big
deal about it.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.960
Pretty great message
of inclusiveness, I'd say.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.250
- I'd say too.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.960
Thank you.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.120
- Oh, Deacon, you mind
coming in here for a sec?

04:15.120 --> 04:17.290
I understand you know
Jessie Caine?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.670
- Yeah, for a long time.
- Nice to see you.

04:19.670 --> 04:21.460
We actually played The Bluebird
not too long ago.

04:21.460 --> 04:22.960
- Oh, okay, well, I saw her
at the Mercy Lounge,

04:22.960 --> 04:24.080
and I asked her to come in.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.710
- Well, great.

04:25.710 --> 04:27.040
- Yeah, I thought she might be

04:27.040 --> 04:30.040
an interesting addition
to Highway 65.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.670
- Well, we should
talk about that.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.960
- We're talking
about it right now.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.960
- Excellent.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.330
I was actually heading on over
to watch Juliette record.

04:38.330 --> 04:39.920
So I got to go right now,

04:39.920 --> 04:41.500
but it was great seeing you.
- You too, yeah.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.330
- Well, you mind if
I walk with you for a sec?

04:43.330 --> 04:44.960
- Oh, sure, yeah.
- Great.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.790
So the story I heard

04:47.790 --> 04:49.920
was she was married
to Brad Maitland.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.710
She had an affair
and he kicked her out.

04:51.710 --> 04:53.330
- Something like that.
I know it was ugly.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.120
- Wasn't there this whole thing
too about a breakdown?

04:55.120 --> 04:57.170
And she abandoned her kid
or something?

04:57.170 --> 04:59.120
- Zach, I usually don't
listen to that crap.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.920
Because it usually is.
- Right, well...

05:00.920 --> 05:02.580
I thought her songs
were boring back in the day.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.500
But they are certainly
not boring now.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.040
Dark little stories coming
from that sweet blonde face.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.330
- You want to sign her then?

05:09.330 --> 05:11.330
- I'm thinking about it, yeah.
But you think it's a bad idea?

05:11.330 --> 05:12.620
- No, I'd just like

05:12.620 --> 05:14.000
to hear some of
the new music, that's all.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.830
- All right, well, I think
you should meet with her too.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.250
- Why do I need
to meet with her?

05:17.250 --> 05:18.620
- Because I got
a feeling about her.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.880
And call it blasphemy,

05:20.880 --> 05:23.000
but I think only 43%
of success is talent.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.330
The rest is just how you feel
when you watch the person.

05:25.330 --> 05:26.830
- And you're sure
about that number?

05:26.830 --> 05:28.920
It's not 44 or 90?

05:28.920 --> 05:30.880
- I'll crunch some numbers
and get back to you.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.830
But just, hey,
meet with her, okay?

05:33.830 --> 05:36.120
Unless you don't want to.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.290
- No.
I'm happy to meet with her.

05:38.290 --> 05:41.750
82% happy.

05:41.750 --> 05:42.920
- I'll take those numbers!

05:54.620 --> 05:55.790
- Hey, Jakob.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.670
- Will, I'd like you
to meet Jakob Fine.

05:57.670 --> 05:59.710
- Oh, we've met.
- Yeah, we have.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.620
How are you?
- Very excited.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.710
We're creating
an American icon today.

06:03.710 --> 06:04.540
- (laughs)

06:04.540 --> 06:06.290
- Take that off.

06:06.290 --> 06:08.040
So the obvious inspiration
for this is Johnny Cash,

06:08.040 --> 06:09.750
the original Man in Black.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.920
But we've made some
subtle variations.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.380
- We love Johnny Cash.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.460
- You ever listen
to the Folsom album?

06:15.460 --> 06:17.250
- No, not exactly.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.710
- Oh, then don't talk to me
about Johnny Cash.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.040
I knew him.
He was an amazing human being.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.460
Okay, everybody out!

06:40.210 --> 06:43.500
Looks good on you.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.460
And you seem confident
enough to wear it.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.290
What are you doing tonight?

06:48.290 --> 06:51.750
- (laughs) Come on.
I have a new boyfriend.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.170
- Oh, I know all about
your new boyfriend.

06:53.170 --> 06:55.000
Who do you think
set up this gig?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.080
And he's flying up later
to host a dinner for you.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.290
Very romantic.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.330
- Were you two friends?

07:00.330 --> 07:04.460
- Interesting term, friends.

07:04.460 --> 07:05.540
- Look, I don't get
what's happening here.

07:05.540 --> 07:06.960
- (laughs)

07:06.960 --> 07:08.880
- What's so funny?

07:08.880 --> 07:11.920
- Well, cowboy, I assume
since you're with Zach now...

07:11.920 --> 07:13.170
- You assumed what?

07:15.330 --> 07:16.960
- Who knows?
Maybe he's changed.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.540
- From what?

07:18.540 --> 07:20.960
- A boy who's got
2 billion dollars,

07:20.960 --> 07:22.620
and decided he could buy
whatever he wanted.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.120
- Thank you guys.
Thank you.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.000
- Thank you so much.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.380
- (giggles) There you go.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.170
- I'll see you next time.
Thank you.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.040
Hey, I remember you.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.540
- No, you don't.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.460
- Yeah, I do.
I signed your cast.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.920
You got a real pretty name.
Nadine, right?

08:38.920 --> 08:40.330
- Yeah.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.580
- Must be something about you,

08:41.580 --> 08:43.250
because I'm terrible with names.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.540
- Why did you have to do it?

08:44.540 --> 08:46.460
You and Gunnar were so perfect?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.420
- Oh, sweetheart, no.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.960
Sweetheart, nobody's perfect.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.540
- I loved you.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.960
- Okay, Nadine,
whatever you think I did,

08:53.960 --> 08:55.710
it's not what happened.

08:55.710 --> 08:57.540
Why do you care
so much anyway, really?

08:57.540 --> 09:01.330
- Because I had your
entire life figured out.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.710
- You had my entire life
figured out?

09:03.710 --> 09:05.920
- Yeah. You and Gunnar and...

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
the baby you were
gonna name Rayna.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.290
And the pit bull mix you were
gonna save from the shelter

09:10.290 --> 09:12.290
because you love
animals so much.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.960
- That sounds really beautiful.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.620
- And you guys were so nice
to each other.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.330
And you--you loved each other.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.210
- We still love each other.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.830
- No. No, you don't.

09:21.830 --> 09:23.580
You're a liar
just like everybody else.

09:23.580 --> 09:26.380
- Okay, Nadine.
I'm sorry. I'm not a liar.

09:26.380 --> 09:29.710
And this life is
complicated for everybody.

09:29.710 --> 09:30.500
You can't just call
somebody that--

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
- No. You know what?

09:31.500 --> 09:33.670
You're a cheater.

09:33.670 --> 09:35.330
And you ruined everything.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.920
- Oh, hey.
- Sorry. Did you wait long?

09:43.920 --> 09:46.250
- Oh, no. I'm always early.
Want to get something?

09:46.250 --> 09:49.290
- Uh, no, thank you.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.290
- So, listen.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.750
I just want to say that
I feel really bad about this.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.580
I saw that Zach
just sprang this on you.

09:56.580 --> 10:00.460
- Don't even worry.
You know...

10:00.460 --> 10:01.960
we spend half our day
talking about

10:01.960 --> 10:05.080
whether we're gonna
sign someone or not.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.330
Anyway, getting to it,

10:06.330 --> 10:08.290
other than The Bluebird,
the other night

10:08.290 --> 10:10.920
which was great...
- Thank you.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.330
- I haven't heard much
of the new stuff, so...

10:12.330 --> 10:14.250
- I do have some new music
that I can send you.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.960
- All right.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.290
My guess is that
you're gonna find it too...

10:18.290 --> 10:20.750
uh, raw and personal.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.830
- Why would you think that?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.000
- Because I do.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.830
Well, you know,
like they say,

10:26.830 --> 10:28.040
the victor gets
to write history.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.290
- Well, that history's gossip,

10:29.290 --> 10:30.460
and I don't listen to it.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.500
- Well, how very gallant of you.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.170
Untrue, but gallant.

10:35.170 --> 10:37.290
Isn't it scary
when the whole world

10:37.290 --> 10:39.960
says you're one thing,
and you know you're not.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.120
- In my case, I had to admit

10:42.120 --> 10:44.750
that the world was partly right.

10:44.750 --> 10:48.040
- The world was partly right
in my case too.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.620
But it wasn't about
running off with Robby White,

10:50.620 --> 10:52.080
and becoming a "scarlet woman."

10:52.080 --> 10:55.830
No, my mistake was...

10:55.830 --> 10:57.420
being a coward,

10:57.420 --> 10:58.710
and staying in a marriage

10:58.710 --> 11:02.040
that I knew was
irretrievably dead.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.710
- Seriously, he made
your son cry on purpose?

11:05.710 --> 11:07.710
- All the time.
It's heartbreaking.

11:07.710 --> 11:12.120
He's just a...

11:12.120 --> 11:15.080
a really angry guy.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.420
And, you know,
he's got a new life now.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.960
So he's happy.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.710
- Yeah, well, he married
his assistant or something?

11:22.710 --> 11:25.080
- My assistant...

11:25.080 --> 11:26.120
and best friend.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.960
- Oh, wow.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.960
- Yeah, looking back,
it was so clear.

11:32.380 --> 11:37.420
But I stayed, you know.

11:37.420 --> 11:42.040
So I guess I was a coward.

11:42.040 --> 11:45.080
But I will be damned if
that ever happens to me again.

11:48.830 --> 11:52.250
- Oh, damn it.
I'm sorry.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.040
- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.500
- Aw, damn it. It just...

11:57.500 --> 12:01.080
It still happens sometimes.

12:01.080 --> 12:06.620
I obviously never thought
I'd be that lucky, that...

12:06.620 --> 12:09.580
after all those years
of screwing up...

12:09.580 --> 12:11.790
Damn it.

12:11.790 --> 12:15.330
- I hope this doesn't
sound terrible

12:15.330 --> 12:19.250
because of all you've
been through, but, um...

12:19.250 --> 12:21.120
- I envy you.

12:24.290 --> 12:27.880
- Not terrible.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.920
So much of it was so hard.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.540
But in the end,
I wouldn't trade any of it.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.120
Not for the world.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.540
We certainly have gone
far afield here, haven't we?

12:44.540 --> 12:47.500
- Right?
We have covered a lot of ground.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.000
- Yeah, and it's 5:00.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.710
- Oh, my God, you're kidding me.

12:51.710 --> 12:54.540
- I'm sorry.
I have to pick up my daughter.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.080
- No, no.
I got to go too.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.500
Well, listen, I really
appreciate this, Deacon.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.420
Thank you for meeting me.
It was really nice.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.880
- It was a pleasure.
Send me the new stuff.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.920
- Yes! Will do.
- All right. Thank you.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.170
- I'm gonna be
at the studio late tonight,

13:19.170 --> 13:21.540
so I can all Emily and have
her watch after Cadence.

13:21.540 --> 13:24.710
- That's fine.
I'll be here.

13:24.710 --> 13:26.170
- Thought you were
working with Hallie.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.960
- Found her another producer.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.080
- What?

13:31.080 --> 13:32.290
- Don't say what.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.250
- Wait a minute.
Because of me?

13:34.250 --> 13:37.120
- Are you seriously asking that?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.380
- I voiced my opinion.
You can make your own choices.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.670
- You didn't voice your opinion.
You went insane.

13:41.670 --> 13:44.420
You made utterly paranoid
accusations of both of us.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.830
- If you already
made that decision,

13:46.830 --> 13:48.330
then you must have agreed
with something I said.

13:48.330 --> 13:51.040
- No, Juliette.
I made that decision

13:51.040 --> 13:52.790
because things can only
go one way with you.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.170
Your way.

13:54.170 --> 13:56.000
Now if anyone tries to go
another way, then God help them.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.830
- Am I supposed to agree
with what you say

13:57.830 --> 13:59.380
just because you say it?

13:59.380 --> 14:00.960
- No, you are
supposed to imagine

14:00.960 --> 14:02.790
at least once in your life

14:02.790 --> 14:05.790
that you might
actually be wrong.

14:05.790 --> 14:07.210
Have a good day in the studio.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.290
- Right.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.500
I'm gonna have to
call you back, Bill.

14:20.830 --> 14:24.040
Scarlett, what brings you here?

14:24.040 --> 14:25.080
- Are you seriously
asking me that?

14:25.080 --> 14:26.830
- Yes.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.790
- I came here to tell you
to your face

14:28.790 --> 14:30.210
that you are
a manipulative liar.

14:30.210 --> 14:31.620
- Did I write something
that was untrue?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.250
- Yes, you did.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.290
It's not really the point
though, is it?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.620
- Well, actually, if you want

14:35.620 --> 14:37.210
to read the transcript,
what I said was

14:37.210 --> 14:38.880
the interview topic
was being left behind.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.210
You never said
anything was off the record.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.920
- Well, then why didn't
you tell everybody

14:41.920 --> 14:43.380
that you were the one who
actually had the affair

14:43.380 --> 14:45.290
with Damien and got
all messed up over it?

14:45.290 --> 14:47.670
- Because I wasn't the subject
of the interview, was I?

14:47.670 --> 14:49.670
- Right, so you take
no responsibility whatsoever.

14:49.670 --> 14:51.420
- Are you feeling bad?

14:51.420 --> 14:53.290
- No. For all the girls
who used to look up to me

14:53.290 --> 14:55.040
because they needed
something in their life.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.290
- Well, it's just time
for them to realize

14:56.290 --> 14:57.830
that not everybody's perfect.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.380
- I never said I was.

14:59.380 --> 15:01.500
The problem is,
your article made it seem

15:01.500 --> 15:03.580
like I had something
to be ashamed of.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.460
And girls have enough shame
heaped onto them every day

15:05.460 --> 15:07.210
without somebody
in your position

15:07.210 --> 15:09.120
making it so much worse.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.330
- I don't know what kind
of world you live in.

15:11.330 --> 15:14.330
I'm sure it's a really nice one,
and I'm sorry if I rocked it.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.040
But this has nothing
to do with shame.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.170
In my world, if there's a scoop,

15:18.170 --> 15:19.920
I publish it.
Or I'm not doing my job.

15:23.580 --> 15:26.460
- I feel sorry for you.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.960
I really do.

15:40.620 --> 15:44.170
- Hey! Wow.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.210
You look great.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.710
New York agrees with you, huh?

15:51.790 --> 15:54.000
I got you a raincoat.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.790
Well, actually,
I got you three raincoats

15:55.790 --> 15:58.250
in three different colors,
so you have options.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.880
- (chuckles) That's great.

16:03.210 --> 16:06.040
- Okay.
You seem officially weird.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.790
- I need to ask you something.

16:10.790 --> 16:14.210
- Okay, but you do
know people are coming, right?

16:14.210 --> 16:16.290
- Who else is there?

16:16.290 --> 16:17.920
- You mean who else
will be here?

16:19.620 --> 16:21.420
- Are you seeing other guys?

16:21.420 --> 16:23.790
- What? No.

16:23.790 --> 16:26.880
What would give you that idea?

16:26.880 --> 16:28.880
- Just, something Jakob said.

16:28.880 --> 16:32.620
- What, Jakob?

16:32.620 --> 16:34.580
That venomous dinosaur.
And you believed him?

16:34.580 --> 16:37.000
- I don't know.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.040
You don't exactly make it easy

16:39.040 --> 16:40.670
with all the traveling
and the texting.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.040
- Well, I run
seven businesses, Will.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.460
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Well, go ahead.

16:46.460 --> 16:49.830
Go ahead and read my texts.
They are very sexy.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.880
- I don't need to read...
- Here. Let's see.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.920
Quarterly shipments from China
are down this month.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.500
Oh, my God!
Here's the smoking gun!

16:56.500 --> 16:57.880
A final inspection for
the solar plant in Nevada

16:57.880 --> 16:59.620
has been scheduled.

16:59.620 --> 17:00.960
- I get it, I get it.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.210
- There's also a message
from my periodontist.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.540
- Shut up.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.080
- Will...

17:09.830 --> 17:12.120
there's only you.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.250
Hi! Welcome, everybody!

17:19.250 --> 17:21.040
Good to see you all.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.080
- Oh, hey, my girls.
How y'all doing today?

18:11.080 --> 18:13.000
- We're starving.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.040
- Well, you should probably fix
yourself something, huh?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.790
- We don't want
to make something.

18:16.790 --> 18:19.500
We want something
already made, like, by you!

18:19.500 --> 18:21.080
- Oh, yeah?
Well, all right.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.460
I'll be happy
to make you something.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.790
Happy to hear y'all
complain about it.

18:25.210 --> 18:27.580
What's that?
- Oh, my God!

18:27.580 --> 18:28.620
That crazy woman
dropped that off.

18:28.620 --> 18:29.580
- What crazy woman?

18:29.580 --> 18:31.290
- Diane whats-her-name.

18:31.290 --> 18:33.210
- Diane Harrison
came by the house?

18:33.210 --> 18:34.830
- Right here.

18:34.830 --> 18:36.290
- Oh, just visiting Sandy
next door.

18:36.290 --> 18:39.460
And I had a pot pie that I made,
and I thought, oh,

18:39.460 --> 18:42.040
Deacon must be in need
of a home-cooked meal.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.620
- She did not say that.
- Oh, yeah.

18:43.620 --> 18:44.960
- I literally ran for my life.
(cell phone rings)

18:47.250 --> 18:48.460
Who's that?

18:48.460 --> 18:51.330
- It's just business.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.040
- Uh-uh, we're not
watching this show.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.790
We always watch
this stupid TV show.

18:55.790 --> 18:57.290
- I refuse to watch
"Love Actually" ever again.

18:57.290 --> 18:58.880
Come on.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.080
- I'm gonna head up

19:00.080 --> 19:02.080
to do some work
in the music room.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.420
Let me know if anybody needs to
go to the hospital, you know.

19:04.420 --> 19:05.670
- (laughing) 'Kay.

19:07.830 --> 19:11.210
- Hey, Deacon,
it's Jessie Caine.

19:11.210 --> 19:12.920
Just wanted to say thank you

19:12.920 --> 19:17.080
for a really lovely
and unexpected afternoon.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.580
You were really kind to listen.

19:19.580 --> 19:22.000
So, any rate...
I mean, at any rate...

19:22.000 --> 19:25.170
(laughs)
I just wanted to say that

19:25.170 --> 19:28.580
I would really like
to work with you.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.920
I think I could bring
something to the label.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.210
And I know I could benefit
from your experience.

19:34.210 --> 19:38.460
And I hope you and Zach
will consider signing me.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.920
I know this is really long
and embarrassing,

19:39.920 --> 19:41.960
and I'm gonna get
off the phone now, okay--

19:41.960 --> 19:43.580
Oh, actually, (laughs)

19:43.580 --> 19:45.500
there's an entire point
to this phone call.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.460
Forgot about that.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.920
Uh, I'm playing at the
Mercy Lounge again on Tuesday.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.670
A bunch of the new songs
I was talking to you about.

19:52.670 --> 19:57.040
And I'd love it if you
and Zach could come.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.290
So I hope to see you.
Bye.

20:04.420 --> 20:08.210
- So why did you want
to hang out with me?

20:08.210 --> 20:10.670
- Well, because last time
I saw you, you were so upset.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.500
So I figured maybe
we weren't done talking.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.330
- Yeah, but I'm just
a stupid fan.

20:14.330 --> 20:16.290
You are you.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.460
- You are not stupid.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.290
And I'm just a person like you.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.120
- Yeah, but you're delicate
and beautiful.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.420
- So are you.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.710
- Come on.

20:26.710 --> 20:29.580
- Okay? Honestly, firstly,

20:29.580 --> 20:31.290
it took me a really long time

20:31.290 --> 20:34.540
to see anything beautiful
about myself at all.

20:34.540 --> 20:38.580
And, secondly, pretty goes away.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.920
In the end, it doesn't
mean a damn thing.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.290
- Yeah, but it's easy
for you to say.

20:43.290 --> 20:45.290
I mean, you don't have people
calling you horrible names

20:45.290 --> 20:47.080
every day for the way you look.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.750
- I'm sorry.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.380
- When I listen to your music

20:51.380 --> 20:54.170
and I read about you and Gunnar,

20:54.170 --> 20:58.380
it allows me to not have
to be myself for a minute.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.500
And feel what it's like
to be you.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.750
Then this happened.

21:02.750 --> 21:06.210
- What? I turned out
to be human after all?

21:06.210 --> 21:09.120
- You and Gunnar are both so
beautiful and so talented,

21:09.120 --> 21:11.540
and you're not happy.

21:11.540 --> 21:14.170
So how could I ever hope to be?

21:14.170 --> 21:16.000
- Sweetheart, you are beautiful.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.290
And you are so talented.
I've seen your art.

21:19.290 --> 21:21.750
It's gorgeous.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.540
- Stop.
- Yeah, it is.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.170
(text message rings)

21:27.750 --> 21:30.670
- It's my mom.
I gotta go.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.380
Can't leave her at home alone.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.750
- Okay.
You stay in touch if you want.

21:41.670 --> 21:44.120
- You nervous?

21:44.120 --> 21:45.920
You'll be amazing.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.170
- I'll be...something.

21:48.170 --> 21:49.830
- (laughs)

21:50.960 --> 21:52.210
- Camera!

22:04.880 --> 22:07.250
(laughter)

22:15.540 --> 22:17.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.000
Thanks for meeting me.
- No problem.

22:23.290 --> 22:25.080
What's up?

22:25.080 --> 22:26.920
- I want to get a lay
of the land.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.620
You know, get to know the people
that I'm working with.

22:29.620 --> 22:32.620
- Well, you should know
that I got my daughters at home.

22:32.620 --> 22:33.880
So I probably can't
do a big meal thing.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.460
- It's okay.

22:35.460 --> 22:36.540
I know that you don't like me.

22:36.540 --> 22:37.670
- That's not true.

22:37.670 --> 22:39.420
- Okay, I'll rephrase that.

22:39.420 --> 22:40.670
You don't like anything
that I stand for.

22:40.670 --> 22:43.000
- That might be true.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.080
- I took the liberty
of ordering.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.540
Hope that's okay.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.920
Can't argue
with a martini, right?

22:46.920 --> 22:48.500
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.580
- I also can't drink one.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.540
I don't drink.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.080
You really don't
know country music, do you?

22:54.080 --> 22:56.460
- Hey, I am doing
great here, huh?

22:56.460 --> 22:57.420
- Kinda nailing it.
- Hm, yeah.

22:59.670 --> 23:03.210
Look, I just, um--
I want to find the best way

23:03.210 --> 23:05.120
that I can help you
with Highway 65.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.330
- All right, I appreciate that.
I just, you know,

23:08.330 --> 23:12.380
honestly, I'm just...
I'm a guitar player.

23:12.380 --> 23:15.250
In my wildest dreams,
I never imagined

23:15.250 --> 23:17.920
I'd be running some company.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.790
Strategy and marketing
and all this nonsense.

23:20.790 --> 23:24.380
- Yeah...
So, here we are.

23:24.380 --> 23:28.540
You are running a business
because Rayna...

23:28.540 --> 23:31.080
- Yeah.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.330
Mostly for the girls.

23:32.330 --> 23:34.170
That's not true,

23:34.170 --> 23:36.210
It's mostly because I...

23:36.210 --> 23:38.670
couldn't bear to see
her dream die, you know.

23:38.670 --> 23:42.170
A label for artists.
It's what it is,

23:42.170 --> 23:45.290
it's who she was to a T.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.580
Seriously, I wish, you know,
you could have met her.

23:46.580 --> 23:50.710
She was just...
what's so funny? What?

23:50.710 --> 23:52.420
- What? Nothing.

23:52.420 --> 23:53.960
- Some people would say
it was rude

23:53.960 --> 23:55.710
that you're kind of
laughing while I'm--

23:55.710 --> 23:57.830
- I'm not laughing.
Not laughing. Smiling.

23:57.830 --> 23:59.620
I'm sorry, okay?

23:59.620 --> 24:00.710
It's just, now I understand why

24:00.710 --> 24:03.000
every woman over the age of 33

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
gets all goo-goo eyed when I say
that I'm working with you.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.170
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it's true.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.880
It's like you're out of
some novel or something.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.830
- Okay, stop that.

24:11.830 --> 24:14.920
- A handsome widower
still married to his grief?

24:14.920 --> 24:16.120
It's like the plot of
every pulp romance

24:16.120 --> 24:17.790
since "Wuthering Heights."

24:17.790 --> 24:19.250
- You're just trying
to embarrass me now

24:19.250 --> 24:20.380
or something, right?

24:20.380 --> 24:23.080
- It's true.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.960
Speaking of which,

24:24.960 --> 24:27.170
how did your meeting go
with Jessie Caine?

24:27.170 --> 24:28.380
- Speaking of what?

24:28.380 --> 24:30.710
- Women who have crushes on you?

24:30.710 --> 24:32.960
- No.
That was a business meeting

24:32.960 --> 24:34.500
Zach sent me to
that business meeting.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.880
- I know. Oh, I know.
It's okay.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.460
- What are you talking about?

24:39.460 --> 24:41.960
- Girls, you know,
just know these things.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.290
We can always tell.

24:47.290 --> 24:50.250
(cell phone buzzes)

25:08.170 --> 25:09.460
(cell phone buzzes again)

25:30.750 --> 25:32.960
- Hello?

25:32.960 --> 25:34.670
Anybody home?

25:36.170 --> 25:38.170
Hey.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.000
Will, you're packed.
Where are you going?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.750
- I'm going home.

25:42.750 --> 25:46.500
- What about the party tonight?

25:46.500 --> 25:48.290
- You can go without me.

25:48.290 --> 25:50.830
- Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

25:50.830 --> 25:52.750
What's going on here?

25:52.750 --> 25:54.420
- Who are you, Zach?

25:54.420 --> 25:55.960
- I don't understand.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.580
- Why do you have different
cell phones?

26:00.580 --> 26:02.460
- I want you to let me explain.

26:02.460 --> 26:05.830
- I don't think there's
anything to explain, Zach.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.330
This one's called Jeff.
Who are the other ones?

26:08.330 --> 26:09.790
- There's only one.

26:09.790 --> 26:11.620
- You expect me to believe that?

26:11.620 --> 26:13.170
- It's not what you think.

26:13.170 --> 26:15.420
- You know, I'm not real capable

26:15.420 --> 26:16.790
of thinking at this moment...

26:16.790 --> 26:19.040
- Jeff is a guy who loves me!

26:22.580 --> 26:24.620
- That's great.

26:27.540 --> 26:28.380
And you love him?

26:28.380 --> 26:30.500
- No! I used to,

26:30.500 --> 26:32.830
but I haven't
in a very long time.

26:32.830 --> 26:34.210
- So why do you call him?

26:34.210 --> 26:35.210
- I don't.
He calls me.

26:35.210 --> 26:36.580
- What's the difference?

26:36.580 --> 26:38.420
- He can't let go, Will!

26:38.420 --> 26:40.580
Okay, it's complicated.

26:40.580 --> 26:43.540
He's fragile and I feel guilty.

26:43.540 --> 26:44.790
I'm afraid of what
might happen and--

26:44.790 --> 26:46.380
- I don't believe it.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.960
- No, please, please, please.
You know me, okay?

26:50.540 --> 26:51.790
You know it's really hard
for me to hurt people.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.040
- You're hurting me.

26:57.210 --> 26:58.790
- No, please, don't go, Will.

26:58.790 --> 27:00.960
Will, the person I love is you!

27:04.120 --> 27:05.170
- We'll talk about it
in Nashville.

27:05.170 --> 27:06.290
Right now, I just gotta go.

27:06.290 --> 27:08.670
- Will...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.210
- Hey.

27:17.210 --> 27:19.170
- I cannot believe this.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.290
- What?

27:20.290 --> 27:23.380
- Mackenzie Rhodes again.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.210
"Miss O'Connor was visibly angry
with what I had written,

27:25.210 --> 27:26.880
but she didn't deny
any of the facts."

27:26.880 --> 27:28.580
- You went back to her?

27:28.580 --> 27:30.210
- Yeah. I was too mad.

27:30.210 --> 27:33.210
- Scarlett, what are you doing?

27:33.210 --> 27:36.000
You're just making it worse
by engaging her.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.750
- I know it's stupid.
I just--

27:37.750 --> 27:38.750
I can't stop
thinking about Nadine.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.330
- The fan girl?

27:40.330 --> 27:41.790
- Ex-fan girl.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.540
- Okay, Scarlett, look.

27:43.540 --> 27:46.380
They don't know who you are,
like, really.

27:46.380 --> 27:48.500
And you're allowing yourself
to get all wrapped up in this.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.960
It's almost as unhealthy
as what they're doing to you.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.330
- I don't think
you know what it's like.

27:53.330 --> 27:56.080
- What what's like?

27:56.080 --> 27:58.790
- Being a girl.

27:58.790 --> 28:00.380
It's a lot of pressure.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.620
And people expect you
to be one way.

28:02.620 --> 28:05.880
And when you're not,
they call you names and...

28:05.880 --> 28:08.750
- Look, I get it.

28:08.750 --> 28:09.830
Boys get called names too.

28:16.210 --> 28:17.920
What?

28:17.920 --> 28:19.830
- Just getting an idea.

28:23.330 --> 28:24.620
- Hi.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.790
- Hey, Jessie.
It's Deacon.

28:25.790 --> 28:27.830
- Thanks for getting back to me.

28:27.830 --> 28:29.620
- Yeah.
I'm sorry it took me so long.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.040
- Oh, no worries.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.120
- Uh, so anyway,
I got your message.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.580
And, yeah, I want to
hear some more songs.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.120
So send 'em over.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.920
- Great! That's awesome.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.500
- Okay, cool.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.290
- So do you want to come
tomorrow night or...

28:42.290 --> 28:44.330
- Uh, well...

28:44.330 --> 28:47.620
- I mean, honestly,
I can just send them to you.

28:47.620 --> 28:49.880
- No, no. I'm happy to come.
I just...

28:49.880 --> 28:52.000
- You just what?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.380
It sounds like there's something
that you want to say.

28:53.380 --> 28:58.250
- Uh...no, not really.

28:58.250 --> 29:01.170
It's just weird right now,
you know.

29:01.170 --> 29:04.580
- Yeah.
Yeah, I can only imagine.

29:04.580 --> 29:06.960
Which is why you
really don't have to...

29:06.960 --> 29:08.420
- No, no, no.
It's okay.

29:08.420 --> 29:12.170
It's just--
I don't really...

29:12.170 --> 29:15.170
talk to that many people
that much recently.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.420
And the other day,
we spent a long time there.

29:18.420 --> 29:22.250
And that was nice.
It was real nice.

29:22.250 --> 29:27.580
I just wanted to be clear,
you know, about...

29:27.580 --> 29:29.880
- Oh, my God. Wow.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.380
- What?

29:31.380 --> 29:33.210
- You think that I'm after you.

29:33.210 --> 29:35.540
- No, no, no, no, Jessie.
I'm just saying that...

29:35.540 --> 29:37.420
- So you think that I invited
you to hear my songs

29:37.420 --> 29:38.830
so that I could insinuate
myself into your life?

29:38.830 --> 29:40.540
- No, no, no!
I'm just trying to be clear

29:40.540 --> 29:42.460
about me, you know,
what I'm thinking.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.250
- Okay. Well, you know what?
It was nice knowing you, Deacon.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.830
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Jessie, hold on, okay?

29:45.830 --> 29:47.710
- You know what?
You have no idea who I am

29:47.710 --> 29:50.670
or what I'm going through
or what I want!

29:50.670 --> 29:52.420
So let me make myself clear.

29:52.420 --> 29:55.290
I'm not looking for
a relationship at all

29:55.290 --> 29:57.670
with anyone probably ever, okay?
- Okay, yes.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.210
- And I'm sure that you
have tons of ladies

29:59.210 --> 30:01.040
that are falling
all over you right now,

30:01.040 --> 30:02.420
but I'm the last person
that you need to worry about,

30:02.420 --> 30:03.460
all right?

30:03.460 --> 30:04.670
So I guess I'll just
see you around.

30:04.670 --> 30:08.040
- Jessie, hold on.

30:12.670 --> 30:14.540
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

30:14.540 --> 30:16.000
- I'm sorry.
Okay, yeah, bye.

30:21.170 --> 30:22.960
- Hi. You've reached
Mackenzie Rhodes.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.830
Leave a message.
(beep)

30:24.830 --> 30:26.500
- Hi, Mackenzie, it's Scarlett.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.420
You're probably
screening this call,

30:27.420 --> 30:29.670
which makes a lot of sense.

30:29.670 --> 30:32.670
I just wanted to let you know
I'm not angry at you anymore.

30:32.670 --> 30:35.040
But I would like to invite you
to something I'm organizing.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.040
It's a little get-together,
nice people with things to say.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.460
And who knows?

30:40.460 --> 30:42.040
It might even be
a story in it for you.

30:43.670 --> 30:46.380
- Keeping in the mind
the edit is still rough,

30:46.380 --> 30:47.580
but I was just so jazzed
by everything

30:47.580 --> 30:49.710
they accomplished out there,

30:49.710 --> 30:52.830
and how much of a natural
this fine fellow is on camera.

30:52.830 --> 30:54.670
That I wanted to show you guys
as soon as possible--

30:54.670 --> 30:56.500
- Just show it already, man!

30:56.500 --> 30:57.920
- Okay, okay, all right.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.790
- I should go.

32:45.790 --> 32:50.120
- No. I...

32:50.120 --> 32:52.170
want you to hear something.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.790
- What do you mean?

32:55.790 --> 32:57.670
(sighs)

32:57.670 --> 33:00.120
- What?
You're calling him right now?

33:00.120 --> 33:01.460
Are you crazy?
Hang up the phone!

33:01.460 --> 33:02.790
- It's the only way
you'll ever trust me.

33:02.790 --> 33:04.750
- Hey!

33:04.750 --> 33:05.920
- Where were you?
I was worried sick.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.170
- Zach, hang up.

33:07.170 --> 33:10.250
- I was out in the desert.

33:10.250 --> 33:13.620
- They don't have
cell service out there?

33:13.620 --> 33:16.420
- Listen, Jeff,
we have to talk, okay?

33:16.420 --> 33:18.420
- I don't like
the sound of that.

33:18.420 --> 33:20.540
- Jeff, it's time.
Come on.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.250
- No.
I'm not talking about this.

33:23.250 --> 33:25.210
Stop, okay?

33:25.210 --> 33:27.460
I'm gonna hang up
if you don't stop!

33:27.460 --> 33:31.620
- Jeff, it's not gonna
work this time.

33:31.620 --> 33:34.040
We need to stop going around
and around, and you know it.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.540
- No.
It doesn't need to be over.

33:36.540 --> 33:38.210
I told you I'm ready to change.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.170
- You don't need to change!

33:40.170 --> 33:41.960
You're perfect just as you are.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.000
You're just...

33:44.000 --> 33:45.670
you're not for me.

33:48.210 --> 33:52.080
- Please?
Zach...

33:52.080 --> 33:55.790
- I'm sorry, Jeff.
- Please.

33:55.790 --> 33:57.210
- I'm really sorry,
but you can't call me anymore.

33:57.210 --> 33:59.330
- This is so wrong.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.880
- Goodbye, Jeff.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.620
- That was horrible.

34:07.620 --> 34:09.170
- It needed to happen
a long time ago.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.040
- Someday you're gonna
do that to me.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.460
- Give me a break!

34:22.460 --> 34:25.290
I'm trying to earn
back your trust.

34:27.790 --> 34:29.330
- Yeah, I know.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.420
- How'd Will do?

34:37.420 --> 34:39.580
- He was great.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.250
- I don't know about this
whole integration thing.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.380
I don't think I can handle it.

34:43.380 --> 34:46.830
- Listen, uh, we need to talk.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.080
- Okay.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.210
- Billy put together
a tour for me.

34:54.210 --> 34:58.460
It's 20 cities
starting in Atlanta.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.620
- And you already agreed?

35:01.620 --> 35:04.120
- It wasn't an easy
decision, but...

35:04.120 --> 35:07.040
I think I have to.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.460
- And you're gonna do this
without even talking to me?

35:08.460 --> 35:11.170
- I'm talking to you now.

35:11.170 --> 35:15.250
- After you've already made
the decision, obviously.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.460
- Yeah, because you weren't
gonna make this decision.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.790
I was.

35:20.790 --> 35:22.290
- Is this about
the Hallie thing?

35:22.290 --> 35:23.540
Are you punishing me?
Is that it?

35:23.540 --> 35:26.120
- It's not about that, okay?

35:26.120 --> 35:28.540
This is something that's been
building in me for a long time,

35:28.540 --> 35:31.670
and I can't put it off anymore.

35:31.670 --> 35:33.670
- What about us?

35:33.670 --> 35:37.210
- Juliette, I'm not
breaking up with you.

35:37.210 --> 35:39.250
It's a tour.

35:39.250 --> 35:42.210
- You can't just leave us!
What am I gonna do?

35:42.210 --> 35:44.580
- Juliette,
you're gonna be fine.

35:44.580 --> 35:45.710
You have the resources
to handle everything.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.380
- Please don't go.
I don't want you to leave.

35:55.380 --> 35:58.830
- I need you to listen to me
right now, okay?

35:58.830 --> 36:02.580
I have been taking care of
everyone for a long time.

36:02.580 --> 36:06.620
Taking care of you
and putting myself aside.

36:06.620 --> 36:10.380
And I'm grateful for all of it.

36:10.380 --> 36:13.420
And I'm so proud of you.
Look how far you've come.

36:13.420 --> 36:17.210
You're completely healed.

36:17.210 --> 36:20.790
But I need to do this, okay?

36:20.790 --> 36:22.580
I have to do something
for myself now.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.500
You understand?
- Yes.

36:27.290 --> 36:29.460
How long are you gonna be gone?

36:29.460 --> 36:31.880
- Seven weeks.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.170
You're gonna be okay.

36:33.170 --> 36:34.540
You will, I promise.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.210
- Thank you.
- Juliette.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.540
- Thank you all so much
for coming tonight.

36:44.540 --> 36:46.790
Especially to Nadine
for busting me,

36:46.790 --> 36:48.620
and making me see
things differently.

36:48.620 --> 36:50.380
- But do you really?
- What do you mean?

36:50.380 --> 36:52.380
- I mean, people like you...

36:52.380 --> 36:54.210
- Okay, let me stop you
right there.

36:54.210 --> 36:55.540
And thank you too.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.210
- Why?
- For what you just said.

36:57.210 --> 37:00.380
"People like you".
I can guess the rest.

37:00.380 --> 37:03.290
But I'm pretty sure that we all
have something in common here.

37:03.290 --> 37:06.040
- Like what?
- Like shame.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.670
- I don't get it.

37:07.670 --> 37:10.210
- So I know y'all
have been hearing

37:10.210 --> 37:12.170
a lot of people say
I should be ashamed of myself.

37:12.170 --> 37:14.040
Thing is,
I've heard that before.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.290
When I was your age,

37:17.290 --> 37:20.420
I weighed about 14 pounds
or something.

37:20.420 --> 37:23.170
I was like a little
pale stick figure.

37:23.170 --> 37:25.170
Would've blown away
in a strong wind.

37:25.170 --> 37:29.170
I had a lazy eye, so I had to
wear a pirate patch thing.

37:29.170 --> 37:30.750
People gave me hell about it.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.250
The worst part of it was

37:32.250 --> 37:35.790
that I shamed myself
for being shamed.

37:35.790 --> 37:37.620
Instead of laughing at the world

37:37.620 --> 37:40.040
when it was its meanest
or fighting back,

37:40.040 --> 37:42.580
I just--I agreed with it.

37:42.580 --> 37:44.500
Thought I deserved it.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.830
And when I was talking
to Nadine earlier,

37:46.830 --> 37:50.920
I realized that inside
I'm still that little girl.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.080
I thought to myself,

37:52.080 --> 37:53.330
I wonder what it
would have been like

37:53.330 --> 37:55.120
if when I was your age
I had somebody to talk to

37:55.120 --> 37:56.750
about all that.

37:56.750 --> 37:59.670
Maybe life wouldn't
have been so lonely.

37:59.670 --> 38:00.710
So who wants to talk?

38:08.040 --> 38:10.830
Yeah?

38:10.830 --> 38:13.830
- I have a seizure disorder.

38:13.830 --> 38:15.380
- Sorry.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.750
- So am I.

38:17.750 --> 38:20.460
My first episode
was in ninth grade.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.330
And that was the day
I started being called

38:22.330 --> 38:27.040
Spazzy Katy which is
what I'm called every day.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.880
- There was eight of them.

38:29.880 --> 38:33.120
And before they beat me up,

38:33.120 --> 38:35.170
they just looked at each other
and smiled.

38:35.170 --> 38:39.250
- These kids knew
I couldn't swim, right?

38:39.250 --> 38:41.580
So they chased me to the pond.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.580
And grabbed me
by my arms and legs,

38:43.580 --> 38:46.250
and tossed me right on in.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.540
Damn near drowned.

38:48.540 --> 38:51.000
And I still can't swim.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.750
- These girls I go
to high school with,

38:53.750 --> 38:58.170
they pinned me down
on the girl's locker room floor.

38:58.170 --> 39:02.670
And they wouldn't let me up.
I couldn't see or breath.

39:02.670 --> 39:06.210
And it's really scary.

39:06.210 --> 39:10.250
- I had to have
an operation on my spine.

39:10.250 --> 39:11.620
I was 14.

39:11.620 --> 39:15.830
I spent a year in a body brace.

39:15.830 --> 39:18.620
Kids at school would call me

39:18.620 --> 39:21.080
The Bride of Frankenstein.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.750
They'd throw my books
on the floor.

39:23.750 --> 39:25.710
And watch me struggle
because they'd know

39:25.710 --> 39:27.880
how hard it would be for me
to be able to pick them up.

39:27.880 --> 39:32.210
And they did other things
that I don't want to talk about.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.540
When people treat you
that way long enough,

39:36.540 --> 39:39.670
you start to believe it.

39:39.670 --> 39:41.120
That's how shame wins, I think.

39:44.170 --> 39:45.540
I'm sorry.
