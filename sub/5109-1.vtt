01:46:03.033 --> 01:46:05.968
[ Heavy Breathing ]

01:46:48.979 --> 01:46:52.244
Are you scared?

01:46:52.316 --> 01:46:54.750
I don't get scared.

01:46:57.387 --> 01:47:00.151
My parents will try
to find me.

01:47:00.224 --> 01:47:03.250
Mine won't.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.449
This is my first time.

01:47:28.952 --> 01:47:31.113
You're kidding.

01:47:31.188 --> 01:47:33.179
I'm sorry.

01:47:33.257 --> 01:47:35.885
I still want to do it.

01:47:35.959 --> 01:47:39.292
I just... thought
I should tell you...

01:47:39.363 --> 01:47:41.558
in case you wondered why I--

01:47:41.632 --> 01:47:44.465
I wasn't... better.

01:47:57.648 --> 01:47:59.912
What's wrong?

01:48:05.956 --> 01:48:09.756
I thought you said
I was beautiful.

01:48:09.827 --> 01:48:11.852
You are beautiful.

01:48:14.598 --> 01:48:18.193
You are so... beautiful.

01:48:21.572 --> 01:48:24.040
And I would be a very...

01:48:24.107 --> 01:48:26.075
lucky man.

01:48:27.411 --> 01:48:30.039
I feel so stupid.

01:48:30.113 --> 01:48:32.604
Don't.

01:48:32.683 --> 01:48:35.743
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. [ Sobbing ]

01:48:35.819 --> 01:48:39.846
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

01:48:39.923 --> 01:48:42.824
It's okay.

01:48:42.893 --> 01:48:46.192
Everything's okay.

01:49:01.245 --> 01:49:04.043
Wow, I was starving.

01:49:04.114 --> 01:49:08.608
- Do you want me
to make you another one?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

01:49:08.685 --> 01:49:11.051
You sure?

01:49:11.121 --> 01:49:16.115
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better. Thanks.

01:49:19.563 --> 01:49:23.294
- How's Jane?
- What do you mean?

01:49:24.768 --> 01:49:27.259
I mean,

01:49:27.337 --> 01:49:29.703
how's her life?

01:49:29.773 --> 01:49:31.934
Is she happy?

01:49:32.009 --> 01:49:35.172
Is she miserable?

01:49:35.245 --> 01:49:39.807
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

01:49:42.119 --> 01:49:45.384
[ Sighs ]
She's, uh--

01:49:45.455 --> 01:49:48.515
She's really happy.

01:49:48.592 --> 01:49:52.119
She thinks she's in love.
[ Scoffs ]

01:50:02.873 --> 01:50:06.172
Good for her.

01:50:07.978 --> 01:50:09.912
How are you?

01:50:17.888 --> 01:50:21.324
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

01:50:27.764 --> 01:50:30.460
I'm great.

01:50:36.173 --> 01:50:39.165
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

01:50:51.955 --> 01:50:54.287
I'm great.

01:51:28.558 --> 01:51:31.652
Man, oh man.

01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:36.363
Man, oh man, oh man.

01:51:44.941 --> 01:51:47.273
[ Gunshot ]

01:52:11.635 --> 01:52:14.069
[ Jane Shudders ]
Oh, my God.

01:52:56.012 --> 01:52:58.105
Wow.

01:52:59.716 --> 01:53:02.480
[ Lester Narrating ] I had always
heard your entire life flashes...

01:53:02.552 --> 01:53:06.454
in front of your eyes
the second before you die.

01:53:06.523 --> 01:53:09.287
First of all,
that one second...

01:53:09.359 --> 01:53:12.123
isn't a second at all.

01:53:12.195 --> 01:53:14.288
It stretches on forever,

01:53:14.364 --> 01:53:17.197
like an ocean of time.

01:53:19.136 --> 01:53:22.162
For me, it was
lying on my back...

01:53:22.239 --> 01:53:26.107
at Boy Scout camp,
watching falling stars.

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.373
[ Gunshot ]

01:53:34.484 --> 01:53:37.749
And yellow leaves
from the maple trees...

01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:40.255
that lined our street.

01:53:45.328 --> 01:53:47.319
[ Gunshot ]

01:53:49.032 --> 01:53:52.331
Or my grandmother's hands
and the way her skin...

01:53:52.402 --> 01:53:54.734
seemed like paper.

01:53:59.976 --> 01:54:01.910
[ Distant Gunshot ]

01:54:01.978 --> 01:54:05.744
And the first time
I saw my cousin Tony's...

01:54:05.815 --> 01:54:08.784
brand-new Firebird.

01:54:10.554 --> 01:54:12.784
[ Panting ]

01:54:20.497 --> 01:54:22.590
And Janie.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.934
And Janie.

[ Gasps, Sobs ]

01:54:36.046 --> 01:54:38.207

[ Wailing ]

01:54:57.901 --> 01:55:00.267
And... Carolyn.

01:55:05.308 --> 01:55:09.074
I guess I could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me,

01:55:09.145 --> 01:55:14.640
but it's hard to stay mad when
there's so much beauty in the world.

01:55:14.718 --> 01:55:19.883
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing
it all at once and it's too much.

01:55:19.956 --> 01:55:25.053
My heart fills up like a balloon
that's about to burst.

01:55:25.128 --> 01:55:29.224
And then I remember
to relax...

01:55:29.299 --> 01:55:32.393
and stop trying
to hold on to it.

01:55:32.469 --> 01:55:36.064
And then it flows
through me like rain,

01:55:36.139 --> 01:55:39.836
and I can't feel anything
but gratitude...

01:55:39.909 --> 01:55:42.070
for every single moment...

01:55:42.145 --> 01:55:46.081
of my stupid little life.

01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:49.585
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, I'm sure.

01:55:49.653 --> 01:55:51.644
But don't worry.

01:55:52.756 --> 01:55:55.088
You will someday.

01:55:59.996 --> 01:56:04.194
Ahhh, ahh

01:56:05.335 --> 01:56:10.034
Because the world is round

01:56:10.106 --> 01:56:16.102
It turns me on

01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.515
Because

01:56:20.583 --> 01:56:23.279
The world

01:56:23.353 --> 01:56:28.222
Is round

01:56:33.196 --> 01:56:35.289
Ahh

01:56:35.365 --> 01:56:40.064
Because the wind is high

01:56:40.136 --> 01:56:45.972
It blows my mind

01:56:47.644 --> 01:56:50.477
Because

01:56:50.547 --> 01:56:53.072
The wind

01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:57.916
Is high

01:56:59.889 --> 01:57:03.655
Ahhh, ahh

Love is old, Love is new

Love is all, Love is you

01:57:17.173 --> 01:57:21.837
Because the sky is blue

01:57:21.911 --> 01:57:27.816
It makes me cry

01:57:29.252 --> 01:57:32.187
Because

01:57:32.255 --> 01:57:34.883
The sky

01:57:34.958 --> 01:57:39.657
Is blue
