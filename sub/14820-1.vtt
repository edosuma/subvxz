ADULT TERRY:
I suppose our lives

00:34.375 --> 00:36.709
are really just a collection
of moments.

00:36.792 --> 00:40.000
Some moments tell us
who we are,

00:40.083 --> 00:43.583
others,
what we might have been.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.250
MAN:
Hey.

00:49.333 --> 00:50.291
Hey, Chief.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.625
It's the birthday boy!

00:51.709 --> 00:54.291
You going any way
in particular, Terry?

00:54.375 --> 00:56.208
Going to see my dad.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.583
Your old man was supposed
to come fishing with me

00:58.667 --> 00:59.959
before it got too cold.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.000
He's working.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.208
Well, someday.

01:03.291 --> 01:05.083
When he's not working, okay?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.375
Okay.

01:06.458 --> 01:07.500
All right.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.000
Happy birthday.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.250
Thanks.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.000
ADULT TERRY:
I mark my ninth birthday

01:27.083 --> 01:30.000
at the moment I tried
to cross the distance

01:30.083 --> 01:31.625
dividing my father and me.

01:31.709 --> 01:34.375
I went looking for my father

01:34.458 --> 01:38.041
in a world he kept separate
from me.

01:38.125 --> 01:42.083
A world of summer people
who came to Rose Point.

01:45.458 --> 01:47.417
My father worked
as their caretaker,

01:47.500 --> 01:50.125
opening their mansion cottages
at the end of May each year,

01:50.208 --> 01:54.291
and maintaining them
through the long Maine
winters.

01:54.375 --> 01:57.709
It was a place where people
named their houses: Northwinds,

01:57.750 --> 02:03.709
Fairhaven, Kettlecove
and here, Serenity Cottage.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.333
Some men are making money
right now.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.125
I'm making ice.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.875
What are you doing there?
You lost?

02:11.959 --> 02:14.125
I thought you were going
to the carousel.

02:14.208 --> 02:16.375
I thought maybe
we could go together.

02:16.458 --> 02:19.458
Can't. I got work to do.

02:19.542 --> 02:20.750
See, I have a job.

02:20.834 --> 02:21.667
And these people,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.208
they can take away my job,
just like that.

02:25.291 --> 02:27.333
And then where
would we be, hmm?

02:27.417 --> 02:28.375
Poor.

02:28.458 --> 02:29.792
You got it.

02:29.875 --> 02:32.208
The Wentworth family
is coming up

02:32.291 --> 02:35.166
to Serenity Cottage
for Christmas again.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.291
They want a skating rink.

02:36.375 --> 02:38.166
Where they come from?

02:38.250 --> 02:39.375
New York City.

02:39.458 --> 02:42.208
It's backwards, you know.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.542
No heat.
The pipes will freeze.

02:44.625 --> 02:47.125
I guess people are just silly
sometimes.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.458
Anyway, I've a mountain
to climb

02:49.542 --> 02:51.291
to get this place ready.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.875
Can I help?

03:05.333 --> 03:06.834
What do these people think
they're doing?

03:06.917 --> 03:08.125
Don't they know
it's winter up
here yet?

03:08.208 --> 03:09.125
I wonder.

03:09.166 --> 03:10.125
Summer people.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.166
They're supposed
to migrate with the birds.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.458
We shouldn't have to deal
with them again until June.

03:19.792 --> 03:22.125
Get the door, huh?

03:35.041 --> 03:37.208
Don't touch anything.

03:39.375 --> 03:42.208
Look, this isn't a place
for kids.

03:44.041 --> 03:47.542
His shop was
my father's kingdom,

03:47.625 --> 03:49.834
a place where my mother,
when she was alive,

03:49.917 --> 03:51.583
had never been welcomed.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.750
This was the center of his life

03:53.834 --> 03:56.166
and I longed
to be a part of it.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.208
Son.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.959
( saw grinding )

04:38.041 --> 04:39.375
Stay clear.

04:42.542 --> 04:43.417
The top.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.375
Got it?

04:45.458 --> 04:46.875
Got it.

05:09.959 --> 05:12.375
First thing we gotta do
is them shutters at Serenity.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.375
Be sure you dress warm now.

05:13.458 --> 05:14.291
( knocking )

05:14.375 --> 05:15.375
Yep?
Morning, Mac.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.834
Morning!

05:16.959 --> 05:19.375
You want some coffee?

05:19.458 --> 05:20.250
No, that's all right.

05:20.583 --> 05:22.500
I just stopped by
to drop something off.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.333
For me?

05:24.417 --> 05:27.000
Maybe you should wait for
Christmas to open that, hmm?

05:27.083 --> 05:28.875
Nah, go ahead

05:28.959 --> 05:31.709
and open it now--
it's a birthday present, too.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.583
Wow. A fingerprinting kit.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.959
Just like the ones
we use at the station.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.375
Well, we gotta get going.

05:47.458 --> 05:50.041
Yeah, go out and freeze
to death, you two.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.750
What do you say?

05:51.834 --> 05:52.750
Thanks, Chief.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.083
Ah, you're welcome, son.

05:54.166 --> 05:57.375
You go and, uh, keep
your old man in line now.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.500
( chuckling )

06:02.500 --> 06:03.959
Well, come on.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.792
Let's get 'em settled.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.417
Where are we?
It's freezing.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.417
Serenity!

06:16.750 --> 06:18.333
I don't know why
I let you talk me into this.

06:18.417 --> 06:19.792
MAN:
Here we are.

06:21.709 --> 06:23.917
Ah, everything looks great, Mac.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.375
Thanks, Mac.
Thanks a million.

06:29.458 --> 06:30.500
MAC:
Sure.

06:30.875 --> 06:35.500
And you, you must be
your father's right-hand man.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.458
Charles Wentworth.
I'm Terry McQuinn.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.417
A strong handshake.
That's good.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.375
How old are you, son?

06:40.458 --> 06:41.291
Nine.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.792
Wow. What are you,
tall for your age?

06:43.875 --> 06:46.375
This is my daughter,
Katherine

06:46.458 --> 06:47.375
and she's...

06:47.750 --> 06:50.959
You want to tell Terry
how old you are, Teapot?

06:51.041 --> 06:55.417
Mm-hmm. I'm four.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.834
Hey.
( giggling )

07:07.917 --> 07:10.625
So, what do you want
for Christmas, son?

07:10.709 --> 07:12.375
I already got this.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.625
It's a fingerprinting kit.

07:14.709 --> 07:16.417
Wow. Look at that.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.625
Teapot, should
we give Terry

07:19.709 --> 07:21.875
our fingerprints?

07:21.959 --> 07:23.834
Put your thumb here.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.792
Press and do mine.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.500
And your other fingers there.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.750
All right. Okay.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.667
Fingerprint.

07:34.750 --> 07:35.834
And there?

07:35.917 --> 07:36.834
Yep.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.375
Boom!

07:38.458 --> 07:39.375
Boom!

07:39.458 --> 07:40.709
Look how pretty
yours are.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.875
Here, you want to keep them?

07:44.750 --> 07:47.083
Thank you.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.542
You know what?

07:48.625 --> 07:51.208
I'm gonna put these
in a safe place.

07:51.291 --> 07:54.583
Aren't we going to go see
the sick children, Daddy?

07:56.875 --> 07:57.959
Yes, we are, sweetheart.

07:58.041 --> 07:58.959
You know what?

07:59.083 --> 08:00.458
I want you to go upstairs.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.792
I want you to wash
the ink off your hands.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.458
I'll be right down, okay?

08:04.542 --> 08:05.667
Excuse me, Mac.
I'll be right back.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.583
Sure.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.375
Come on, sweetheart.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.583
Let's get those hands washed
and something warm to drink.

08:12.667 --> 08:13.917
Okay.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.542
I don't remember it
being this cold.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.250
It's winter, ma'am.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.083
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

08:32.166 --> 08:33.875
Oh, not that again.

08:33.959 --> 08:34.917
Come here!

08:35.000 --> 08:36.917
My husband has
been apologizing

08:37.000 --> 08:38.917
for my money ever since
he began spending it.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.750
But he makes up for it

08:40.083 --> 08:41.875
on the tennis court,
don't you, dear?

08:41.959 --> 08:43.959
And the golf course.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.583
He used to be an All-American
football hero.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.583
That's enough, dear.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.959
That's enough.

08:50.041 --> 08:54.458
Hey, Mac, will you let
your son come with us?

08:54.542 --> 08:55.625
It's a tradition of mine.

08:55.709 --> 08:56.542
Every Christmas we try

08:56.875 --> 08:58.583
and cheer up the children
at the hospital.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.792
Come on.
We won't be gone long.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.125
Oh, come on, Mac.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.041
It's Christmas.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.834
Christmas is a time
for children, right?

09:08.250 --> 09:09.792
Come on.

09:15.834 --> 09:18.667
Come on, Teapot.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.750
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

09:30.834 --> 09:33.250
BOY:
It's Santa!

09:33.375 --> 09:35.583
Are there children in here?
Ho, ho!

09:35.667 --> 09:37.959
You look like you need
a Christmas present.

09:38.041 --> 09:40.667
Merry Christmas.

09:40.750 --> 09:44.500
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

09:44.583 --> 09:46.333
Merry Christmas.
Have you been good?

09:46.417 --> 09:49.250
Bring one to your
friend over there.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.625
Hold on.

09:53.625 --> 09:54.709
Merry Christmas!

09:54.792 --> 09:57.542
Give this kid a present.
Thank you!

09:57.625 --> 09:59.250
Merry Christmas!

10:12.083 --> 10:14.000
Can you skate, son?

10:14.083 --> 10:15.166
Not really.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.291
I have skates.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.041
That's right.
She can really fly
across the ice,

10:19.125 --> 10:20.166
can't you, Teapot?

10:20.250 --> 10:23.250
Uh-huh.
You taught me daddy.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.625
We'll be back at the
cottage in no time.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.667
Whoa!

10:36.792 --> 10:38.083
( tires screeching )

10:40.375 --> 10:41.750
Katie!

10:41.834 --> 10:43.208
Katie!

10:43.291 --> 10:44.333
Look out, Katie!

10:44.417 --> 10:45.875
( thud )

10:51.959 --> 10:54.083
( Katie crying )

10:54.166 --> 10:56.125
Are you all right?

10:57.709 --> 10:58.917
Are you all right?

11:05.959 --> 11:07.875
( grunts )

11:28.166 --> 11:29.834
Oh, my... God...

11:32.125 --> 11:33.959
( labored breathing )

11:46.041 --> 11:48.625
OFFICER:
Yeah, I need you to make
a report on it, all right?

11:54.041 --> 11:55.750
Take the measurements.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.333
TERRY:
It's okay.

12:09.417 --> 12:10.709
( Katherine whimpering )

12:10.792 --> 12:13.709
Let me help you, Katherine.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.125
There.

12:17.959 --> 12:19.709
We're gonna be okay.

13:01.542 --> 13:03.125
What happened?

13:03.208 --> 13:04.291
A woman's dead.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.792
Her child's in surgery now.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.083
They broke down by the side
of the road.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.792
Wentworth's car
ran over them.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.875
He's disappeared.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.125
Disappeared?

13:14.208 --> 13:15.875
We're out looking for him now.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.417
Thank you...
for bringing him home.

13:26.208 --> 13:29.250
You shouldn't have been
in that man's car.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.875
Someday you'll know
who you are...

13:32.959 --> 13:34.917
and where you belong.

13:37.542 --> 13:40.959
There were a lot of prayers
that Christmas.

13:41.041 --> 13:44.166
Prayers that the child
would survive.

13:44.250 --> 13:47.417
Prayers that Mr. Wentworth
would be found.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.166
None of the prayers
was answered.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.834
Mrs. Wentworth had my father
close the place that winter.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.291
He never took me to work
with him again.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.125
MAN:
Hey, Terry,
nice speech..

14:50.000 --> 14:51.959
( chatter and laughter )

15:05.667 --> 15:07.375
( sighs )

15:09.417 --> 15:10.583
Dad.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.917
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.875
Thanks for coming.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.417
Oh, no.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.542
That ceremony over already?

15:20.959 --> 15:23.542
Should've known better than
to expect you to be there.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.166
Yeah, well,
Mr. Jacobi
called me

15:25.208 --> 15:27.667
and I just didn't
think it would
take me this long.

15:27.750 --> 15:31.417
Couldn't he get one of his other
lackeys to get ice for him?!

15:33.417 --> 15:34.542
What did you say?

15:34.625 --> 15:36.375
You heard me.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.667
( sighs )

15:38.750 --> 15:40.625
Climbing over that gate--

15:40.709 --> 15:42.625
you can get
arrested for that.

15:42.709 --> 15:46.333
We've never had a criminal
in this family before.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.458
We've never had a family.

15:48.542 --> 15:52.333
Never had a family?

15:52.417 --> 15:55.291
Then who've I been working
for all my life, hmm?

15:55.375 --> 15:58.000
A bunch of people
that don't care about you.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.583
I have spent my entire life
providing for you.

16:01.667 --> 16:06.041
Well, Dad, you did a great job.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.333
You get out of here.

16:08.417 --> 16:12.083
You get out of here now
and don't ever bother
me at work again!

16:14.125 --> 16:17.041
Yeah. I'd better let you go.

16:17.125 --> 16:19.500
I think I hear
Mr. Jacobi calling.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.875
I hope you get
a big tip for this.

16:24.959 --> 16:27.000
You know what your problem is?

16:27.083 --> 16:29.041
You think you're better than me.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.250
Oh, I will be.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.542
I'm shoving off, Pop.

17:04.709 --> 17:08.333
I'll try to keep in touch.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.417
That day, I took a vow

17:22.500 --> 17:26.208
that I would be a better man
than my father.

17:26.291 --> 17:30.291
I wouldn't lose sight of
the things that are important.

17:32.333 --> 17:35.333
Charlie, that outline you sent
over is totally unacceptable.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.458
Bill Sanders is never
going to approve it.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.458
Now, I need to hear back
from you ASAP.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.041
And if you can't reach me here,
try me on my cell.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.083
I want to hear back
from you right away.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.792
( knock at door )

17:45.875 --> 17:47.834
Hey, Bill. What's up?

17:47.917 --> 17:50.041
The Chandler deal got
the green light.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.375
Well, I told you not to worry.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.000
That takes care of
your weekend. Sorry.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.083
Don't be.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.709
I'll talk to you
later, Terry.

17:57.792 --> 17:59.083
All right.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.500
Wendy, there it is.

18:00.583 --> 18:03.208
I need that by noon, all right?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.333
( phone ringing )

18:04.792 --> 18:08.750
Hey, six girls
from the typing pool
and the Swiss Alps.

18:08.834 --> 18:11.542
Oh, that sounds like
Christmas to me.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.375
Oh, I can't.
Why not?

18:13.458 --> 18:14.709
Too much work.

18:14.792 --> 18:17.125
Deck the halls
with piles of money, huh?

18:17.208 --> 18:19.083
Do they still
have typing pools?

18:19.959 --> 18:22.041
( typing )

18:27.667 --> 18:30.041
( phone ringing )

18:35.417 --> 18:36.500
Terry McQuinn.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.166
Hello, Terry.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.542
It's your father.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.583
My doctor wants
to speak with you.

18:59.291 --> 19:03.083
Hi. Uh, my father
is a patient here.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.166
His name, please.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.542
Uh, McQuinn.

19:09.917 --> 19:12.166
I'm sorry.
I'm not finding him.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.125
How do you spell that?

19:14.208 --> 19:16.792
M-C-Q-U-I-N-N.

19:16.875 --> 19:19.709
That's the last name.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.667
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:21.750 --> 19:25.125
Uh, I'd better call
his doctor for you.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.625
Your father...

19:30.208 --> 19:32.667
He died?

19:32.750 --> 19:35.250
I'm sorry.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.709
This is a very nice piece.

19:56.792 --> 19:59.250
It should get a good price.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.500
Mr. McQuinn, did you have a list
of things you'd like to keep?

20:06.709 --> 20:10.458
I haven't been back here in
20 years; you can sell it all.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.917
The auction house could
write you a check

20:12.000 --> 20:13.333
for $5,000 for the whole lot.

20:15.917 --> 20:18.166
$7,500.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.000
I'll have to check.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.458
I want everything out of here
by the end of the week,

20:22.542 --> 20:24.333
so the realtor can start
showing the place.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.375
That would be
no problem, sir.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.834
I never saw this.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.625
Is that your mother?

20:56.583 --> 20:58.542
She died when I was little.

20:58.625 --> 21:02.959
I thought my father got rid
of all her photos after that.

21:03.041 --> 21:04.959
He never wanted any up.

21:35.417 --> 21:39.333
( backup signal beeping )

21:43.375 --> 21:45.834
WOMAN:
Hey, sleeping beauty!

21:45.917 --> 21:48.875
Hey, you can't
sit here.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.333
Can I turn around here?

21:55.417 --> 21:57.000
Be my guest.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.458
Thanks.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.041
I walked towards
Serenity Cottage,

23:47.125 --> 23:50.125
thinking how far I'd ventured
from this place

23:50.208 --> 23:53.083
and the person I'd been
when I'd last seen it.

23:53.166 --> 23:56.667
The years now seemed
to have gone by in a flash.

23:56.750 --> 24:00.959
I wonder if my father had
felt the same loss at the end,

24:01.041 --> 24:05.500
if he'd been surprised at how
quickly his time had passed.

24:13.917 --> 24:16.375
( phone rings )

24:16.458 --> 24:18.500
GIRL:
Please leave your number
for my Mommy.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.250
( beep )

24:20.333 --> 24:21.709
All right. Um...

24:21.792 --> 24:25.083
I'm calling from Rose Point.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.458
Uh, here's the number...

24:26.542 --> 24:33.291
It's 207-555-0139,
for your mommy.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.291
Okay.

25:10.917 --> 25:14.583
( phone ringing )

25:27.291 --> 25:28.333
Hello.

25:28.417 --> 25:31.083
Hi, I'm returning a call
to Mr. McQuinn.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.250
There was a message

25:32.333 --> 25:33.041
left last night.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.333
Uh, yeah, yeah.
That was me. Yes.

25:39.542 --> 25:40.792
( groans )

25:40.875 --> 25:45.208
Is everything okay, Mr. McQuinn?

25:45.291 --> 25:47.291
Uh, I'm not Mr. McQuinn.

25:47.375 --> 25:48.792
I mean, not the Mr. McQuinn

25:48.875 --> 25:51.500
who's opening your cottage
for you. I'm his son.

25:51.583 --> 25:54.250
His son?
When I spoke with your father,

25:54.333 --> 25:57.250
he didn't tell me he had a son
working with him.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.250
I'm not working with him.

25:59.333 --> 26:02.750
I'm here from California
because my father died.

26:02.834 --> 26:03.917
Mr. McQuinn died?

26:04.000 --> 26:04.834
Yes, Yes...

26:05.166 --> 26:09.625
I just spoke with your father
on Monday.

26:09.709 --> 26:11.792
I'm-I'm so sorry.

26:11.875 --> 26:15.875
How well did you know my father?

26:15.959 --> 26:17.166
I didn't know him.

26:17.250 --> 26:18.959
I've never been to Rose Point.

26:19.041 --> 26:21.667
We just spoke on the phone.

26:21.750 --> 26:24.291
I'm leaving. I was supposed
to leave last night.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.542
I'm just trying to tie up
some loose ends here.

26:26.625 --> 26:29.542
You'll have to find someone else
to open your cottage for you

26:29.625 --> 26:31.250
if you're coming for Christmas.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.500
Um, I'm sorry,

26:33.583 --> 26:34.917
I'm going to have to go here.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.500
I'll try
and call you back later.

26:36.583 --> 26:40.375
Okay. I'm so sorry.

26:40.458 --> 26:41.542
Bye.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.500
Okay. Bye-bye.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.458
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Doctor Brand,
call extension 2357.

26:50.542 --> 26:54.000
Doctor Brand,
call Extension 2357.

26:55.667 --> 26:58.500
( elevator bell dings )

26:58.583 --> 27:01.583
Respiratory therapist
to emergency.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.667
Respiratory therapist
to emergency.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.000
May I help you, sir?

27:07.083 --> 27:11.041
Um, I, uh...
I wanted to buy some presents

27:11.125 --> 27:14.291
for the children for Christmas.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.583
There's a tree for presents,
down the corridor.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.834
Would you like to contribute
to the Children's Gift Fund?

27:44.458 --> 27:48.333
Uh, I knew a man
named Charles Wentworth.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.917
Did you?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.500
Yeah, I came to
this hospital with him

27:53.583 --> 27:55.834
one Christmas Eve,
a long time ago.

27:55.917 --> 27:58.375
We brought presents
for the kids.

27:58.458 --> 28:01.125
That was the last time
I saw him.

28:01.208 --> 28:02.750
30 years ago,
on Christmas Eve,

28:02.834 --> 28:03.875
after Charles Wentworth

28:03.959 --> 28:05.458
delivered gifts
for the children,

28:05.542 --> 28:06.959
there was a bad accident.

28:07.041 --> 28:08.083
You remember.

28:08.166 --> 28:09.583
Uh-huh.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.750
Hmm.

28:11.834 --> 28:15.083
I was on shift
when the little
girl came in.

28:15.166 --> 28:18.917
That poor family... and Charles.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.458
He came to work here
a few years after that.

28:22.542 --> 28:24.041
We became great friends.

28:24.125 --> 28:25.208
Is he still here?

28:25.625 --> 28:28.333
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to mislead you.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.083
Charles is dead.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.125
Now, since he passed away,
we established this fund

28:33.208 --> 28:35.375
and every year at Christmas,

28:35.458 --> 28:38.375
we bring gifts for the children,
in his memory.

28:38.458 --> 28:42.834
Hey, can I show
you something?

28:42.917 --> 28:44.583
Come on.

28:49.208 --> 28:51.458
I first met Charles
right in here.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.083
He was standing here,
holding his mop

28:53.166 --> 28:55.125
and he was gazing out
those windows.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.000
Now, he worked nights,
and every once in a while

28:58.083 --> 29:00.000
I would find him here
on his breaks.

29:00.083 --> 29:04.500
He swore he could see the lights
of Rose Point from here.

29:04.583 --> 29:05.959
( chuckles )

29:06.041 --> 29:11.375
Well... that's not possible.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.500
Do you know why he ran away?

29:13.583 --> 29:14.500
The police ruled

29:14.583 --> 29:15.750
it was an accident.

29:15.834 --> 29:17.667
There were no
charges against him.

29:17.750 --> 29:18.834
He was lost.

29:18.917 --> 29:20.834
He disappeared.

29:24.125 --> 29:28.542
Charles killed a woman
and her child.

29:30.291 --> 29:32.041
I think he would have
taken his own life

29:32.125 --> 29:34.625
if it hadn't been
for his daughter.

29:34.709 --> 29:37.208
He kept hoping
he'd see her again.

29:37.291 --> 29:39.875
Of course, there was never
any chance of that.

29:39.959 --> 29:40.875
Why not?

29:41.250 --> 29:43.583
His wife divorced him
and took the child away

29:43.667 --> 29:46.542
and he agonized
over that.

29:46.625 --> 29:50.875
And then one evening he just...

29:50.959 --> 29:52.917
he just didn't show up for work.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.083
And, I thought,
"Well, that's my fault

29:56.166 --> 29:58.959
I finally pushed him too hard."

30:01.583 --> 30:04.625
But then his brother came

30:04.709 --> 30:06.709
and told me he'd died.

30:06.792 --> 30:09.917
It was a heart attack.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.875
Hey. How are you?

30:23.959 --> 30:25.250
Good. You?

30:25.333 --> 30:26.750
I'm all right, thanks.

30:26.834 --> 30:28.583
Um, I could use some help.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.458
That's what
we're here for.

30:30.542 --> 30:31.875
What can I do for you?

30:31.959 --> 30:33.542
Well, I'm looking for someone

30:33.625 --> 30:35.834
who can open up one of
the cottages at Rose Point.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.750
We might be able
to find somebody.

30:37.834 --> 30:39.166
I'll... I'll ask around.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.667
What's your name?

30:40.750 --> 30:41.959
Terry McQuinn.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.500
My father
was caretaker out there.

30:43.583 --> 30:44.750
Mac?

30:46.166 --> 30:49.125
Oh, look, I'm real
sorry about your dad.

30:49.208 --> 30:52.792
Thanks. There's a work order
in my father's shop

30:52.875 --> 30:55.792
to open up Serenity Cottage
for Christmas.

30:55.875 --> 30:58.625
Yeah. He was in here on Monday
telling me about it.

30:58.709 --> 30:59.959
After all these years,

31:00.041 --> 31:02.291
the Wentworth's daughter
is coming back.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.500
The daughter?

31:57.625 --> 31:59.667
( phone ringing )

32:03.375 --> 32:05.709
Yeah?

32:05.792 --> 32:09.542
Wendy... Can you hear me?

32:09.625 --> 32:10.875
I'm still in Maine.

32:10.959 --> 32:13.041
Yeah, I know. The contractor...

32:13.125 --> 32:14.667
I know, I know, I know.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.000
Look, uh... yeah there are
14 different things

32:17.083 --> 32:18.959
I'm supposed to do
in the office today.

32:19.041 --> 32:21.750
But look, I'm thinking of
staying here for a few days.

32:21.834 --> 32:23.583
There's some work here...

32:23.667 --> 32:25.667
( phone connection breaking up)

32:25.750 --> 32:27.583
Wendy, can you hear me?

32:27.667 --> 32:29.291
Yeah. Can you hear me?

32:29.375 --> 32:32.750
Hold on, I'm losing you,
hold on.

32:32.834 --> 32:35.041
I'm going to go outside.

32:35.125 --> 32:36.750
Hello?

32:39.125 --> 32:40.792
Hold on.

32:43.709 --> 32:44.667
Can you hear me?

32:44.750 --> 32:46.625
( phone connection breaking up)

32:46.709 --> 32:48.709
Wendy...

32:48.792 --> 32:51.417
Look, you're...
you're breaking up.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.583
Um, let's... just put
all my calls on voice mail

32:54.667 --> 32:56.417
and I'll check in later. Yeah.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.667
Okay.
Just get back to us, okay?

33:37.458 --> 33:41.083
( keys rattling )

34:10.417 --> 34:12.875
( starts engine )

34:58.125 --> 35:01.125
People say I should
sell this place.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.125
But I'm not smart enough.

35:08.959 --> 35:12.083
You followed me
from Rose Point.

35:12.166 --> 35:13.583
I saw a light.
I thought...

35:13.667 --> 35:16.166
Yeah, I was helping
a man open a cottage.

35:16.250 --> 35:17.959
My father?

35:20.917 --> 35:22.542
You're... you're Mac's boy?

35:22.625 --> 35:24.083
I am.

35:24.166 --> 35:26.000
Well, that's something.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.875
He and I were
talking about you
just the other day.

35:28.959 --> 35:31.208
I'm going to miss him.

35:31.291 --> 35:32.458
My name's Warren.

35:32.542 --> 35:35.834
Terry.

35:35.917 --> 35:39.917
I remember spending a lot
of time here when I was a kid.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.834
Your father rebuilt most of
these carousel horses for me.

35:44.917 --> 35:47.875
He charged me a small fortune
for the work.

35:47.959 --> 35:49.542
But, uh, he was worth it.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.917
Yeah, he was good
at what he did.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.792
Oh yeah,
he was the best.

35:56.291 --> 35:59.417
So... you came home.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.792
I won't be here long.

36:00.875 --> 36:03.834
I'm going back to L.A.
in the next few days.

36:03.917 --> 36:06.417
Oh yeah, you don't
want to stay around here.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.542
This time of the year

36:07.625 --> 36:09.875
there's nothing
but cold here.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.583
Oh, yeah...
you catch your plane tomorrow.

36:12.667 --> 36:15.250
I can take care
of the cottage for Mac.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.458
Nothing I can't handle there.

36:21.500 --> 36:25.208
So, my father never
told you, I guess,

36:25.291 --> 36:29.375
but Serenity Cottage
has quite a history.

36:29.458 --> 36:31.834
No. Really?

36:36.583 --> 36:39.834
You don't see stars
like this where I live.

36:39.917 --> 36:41.875
Too much smog.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.959
Well, good night.

36:46.041 --> 36:47.417
Yeah.

36:54.667 --> 36:55.875
KATHERINE:
12 bedrooms?

36:55.959 --> 36:57.166
And a locked gate.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.125
( chuckling ):
That sounds dreadful.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.125
Well, I've rigged it
to stay open.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.583
Eventually, I'll find the key.

37:02.667 --> 37:04.875
Your father sent us keys.

37:04.959 --> 37:07.083
Oh. That's good.

37:07.166 --> 37:09.583
I never asked you your name.

37:09.667 --> 37:10.917
Katherine.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.542
Katherine.

37:12.625 --> 37:15.083
Uh, are you sure
it's not going to be

37:15.166 --> 37:17.000
too much of an imposition?

37:17.083 --> 37:18.041
Olivia and I...

37:18.125 --> 37:19.625
Olivia?
Your daughter?

37:19.709 --> 37:21.709
My sleeping beauty.

37:21.792 --> 37:24.417
She's on my lap, snoring away.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.583
How old is she?

37:25.667 --> 37:26.625
Six.

37:26.709 --> 37:28.875
Do you have any children?

37:28.959 --> 37:30.375
No.

37:30.458 --> 37:33.417
No, um, a friend of my father's
has offered

37:33.500 --> 37:35.417
to open the cottage for you,

37:35.500 --> 37:38.417
but I was thinking
that I-I may stay around

37:38.500 --> 37:40.375
a few days to help him out.

37:40.458 --> 37:43.291
Oh, oh, that would be
very kind of you.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.583
We're so excited.

37:44.667 --> 37:46.417
I've been telling Olivia

37:46.500 --> 37:50.250
that our Maine days
are going to be live-over days.

37:50.333 --> 37:54.542
Days so wonderful, you want
to live them over again.

37:54.625 --> 37:57.500
( sighing ):
Anyway, I'll let you go.

37:57.583 --> 37:59.583
Um, have a safe trip home.

37:59.667 --> 38:01.250
Yes. Good night.

38:01.333 --> 38:02.583
Bye.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.500
( sighs )

38:25.792 --> 38:28.750
As a boy, I stood in this room
with my father,

38:28.834 --> 38:31.667
and I had dreamed
of one day becoming him.

38:33.792 --> 38:38.041
That was before we became
so angry at one another.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.583
You knew these were here.

39:53.875 --> 39:57.000
Hmm. These photographs--
all of these pictures--

39:57.083 --> 39:59.583
your father saved 30 years ago,

39:59.625 --> 40:01.917
before the movers
could take them away.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.500
When he showed me these
pictures for the first time,

40:05.583 --> 40:07.834
he said that nobody
should ever be

40:07.917 --> 40:10.291
completely forgotten
in this world.

40:12.333 --> 40:14.917
Your father and I had
an argument, after he got word

40:15.000 --> 40:17.250
to open up the place
again for Christmas.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.750
I said we should take
all of these things away.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.792
Why?

40:23.792 --> 40:27.458
Sometimes, things are better
left the way they are.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.542
Do you think
he saved these things,

40:31.583 --> 40:33.417
in case she ever came back?

40:35.458 --> 40:37.417
I don't know.

40:41.750 --> 40:45.458
Imagine my old man
caring about these things.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.417
I talked to a woman

40:48.500 --> 40:51.041
at the hospital
who knew Charles Wentworth.

40:51.125 --> 40:52.625
She told me he died.

40:52.709 --> 40:54.291
( sets down picture )

40:56.000 --> 40:57.291
So...

40:57.375 --> 40:59.291
what do you
say, son?

40:59.375 --> 41:00.834
You want me to take over
from here,

41:00.917 --> 41:02.083
so you can catch your plane?

41:02.500 --> 41:05.542
There's nothing
here that I can't
handle by myself.

41:09.583 --> 41:12.500
Uh, you're probably right.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.917
I ought to just hire you

41:14.000 --> 41:17.041
to open the
cottage and
head back home.

41:19.083 --> 41:21.375
But I'd like to stay
a few more days,

41:21.458 --> 41:23.625
get things
started with you.

41:23.709 --> 41:25.458
You know,
it's amazing,

41:25.542 --> 41:26.792
but I'm actually enjoying

41:26.875 --> 41:28.875
getting some dirt on my hands,
for a change.

41:28.959 --> 41:33.333
Well, it's whatever
you think is best.

41:41.875 --> 41:46.792
Looks like I'll
have to... get me
a different coat.

41:54.083 --> 41:56.875
I spent half the night
working on that.

41:56.959 --> 41:59.875
My father might not be
too impressed.

41:59.959 --> 42:02.625
Don't sell yourself short.

42:02.709 --> 42:05.458
It belongs to Serenity Cottage.

42:11.750 --> 42:13.750
Never saw this picture before.

42:13.834 --> 42:15.834
Hmm.

42:15.917 --> 42:19.583
You may be too
young to remember,

42:19.667 --> 42:21.208
but after your mother
became ill,

42:21.291 --> 42:23.792
your father brought her
to ride the carousel

42:23.875 --> 42:25.166
every Saturday morning.

42:25.250 --> 42:27.583
Did he?

42:31.959 --> 42:34.542
Hey. So, you stuck around
for awhile.

42:34.625 --> 42:35.750
Yeah.

42:35.834 --> 42:38.542
Decided to stay
and open the cottage

42:38.625 --> 42:40.500
for Katherine Wentworth.

42:40.583 --> 42:42.083
Didn't exactly bring

42:42.166 --> 42:44.750
the right clothes
from California.

42:44.834 --> 42:46.250
Well, good for you.

42:46.333 --> 42:47.959
That's a big job.

42:48.041 --> 42:49.959
Yeah, but I've
got some help.

42:50.041 --> 42:52.875
A friend of
my father's
named Warren.

42:52.959 --> 42:54.458
Oh, Warren Wentworth?

42:56.875 --> 42:58.542
What did you say?

42:58.625 --> 42:59.500
Warren.

42:59.583 --> 43:01.458
The old-timer from the carousel.

43:01.542 --> 43:04.166
Charles Wentworth's
brother.

43:12.709 --> 43:14.917
You're a bad liar.

43:19.875 --> 43:21.959
I always was.

43:22.041 --> 43:24.709
Do you want to
tell me the truth?

43:28.750 --> 43:31.709
I wish you hadn't come home
from California.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.125
That's no offense to you.

43:33.208 --> 43:35.208
I don't mean to hurt you
in any way,

43:35.291 --> 43:38.083
but this isn't easy
for anybody.

43:38.166 --> 43:40.458
What isn't easy?

43:41.792 --> 43:44.125
The truth.

43:55.750 --> 43:57.625
( tires squeak )

43:57.709 --> 43:59.208
( horn honks )

44:09.625 --> 44:11.625
WARREN:
The symphony is on tonight.

44:11.709 --> 44:14.542
Another half hour, I'd say.

44:16.375 --> 44:17.750
( tires squeal )

44:19.125 --> 44:21.166
( horns honk )

44:50.458 --> 44:53.208
WARREN:
It's the warmth
from the engines.

44:53.291 --> 44:55.375
I think of them
as fallen angels,

44:55.458 --> 44:57.208
spread out like that.

45:02.709 --> 45:04.083
There's my brother.

45:12.375 --> 45:14.709
Charles Wentworth.

45:21.083 --> 45:24.250
You told the woman
in the hospital
he was dead.

45:25.875 --> 45:27.834
Yeah, Callie Bronson.

45:27.917 --> 45:30.291
Well, she tried to fix
what couldn't be fixed.

45:30.375 --> 45:34.083
He came apart
after he met her.

45:34.166 --> 45:35.917
He couldn't go back to work.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.375
I thought that would be best,
but I-I don't know what's best.

45:39.458 --> 45:41.333
I don't know
what's right.

45:41.417 --> 45:43.375
I don't know
anything.

45:43.458 --> 45:45.291
If you want to leave
those photographs

45:45.375 --> 45:47.250
in the cottage
for Katherine, you can.

45:47.333 --> 45:49.041
Roll down the window.
Call to him.

45:49.125 --> 45:51.834
Tell him his daughter
is coming up here

45:51.917 --> 45:53.417
to Rose Point for Christmas.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.750
I don't know. Do...

45:57.875 --> 46:00.417
do whatever's in your heart.

46:33.834 --> 46:35.792
Why don't you hang on to these?

46:40.542 --> 46:42.709
KATHERINE:
Are you still at Rose Point?

46:42.792 --> 46:47.166
Yes, uh, I should be leaving
in a few days.

46:47.250 --> 46:50.250
Look, I-I meant
to ask you, um...

46:50.333 --> 46:54.125
what room did you sleep in
when you came here as a child?

46:54.208 --> 46:56.000
( chuckling ):
I'm sorry.

46:56.083 --> 47:00.709
I'm in the midst of a
tickling fight with
a little monster.

47:00.792 --> 47:03.709
Um, uh...I-I've never
been to Rose Point.

47:03.792 --> 47:07.333
My mother closed the cottage
after my father left her.

47:07.417 --> 47:08.875
Just before I was born.

47:08.959 --> 47:11.208
Your mother
never brought you here?

47:11.291 --> 47:14.125
No, too many painful memories,
I guess.

47:14.208 --> 47:15.458
Oh, okay.

47:15.542 --> 47:17.250
Well, I see.

47:17.333 --> 47:19.500
I want to talk
to him, Mommy.

47:19.583 --> 47:21.083
Olivia!

47:21.166 --> 47:23.166
( giggling )

47:23.250 --> 47:25.083
Hello?

47:26.583 --> 47:29.333
We're excited,
Terry McQuinn!

47:29.417 --> 47:31.208
Is there snow there?

47:31.291 --> 47:35.041
Um, well, there's a little bit,
and I'm sure there's going to be

47:35.125 --> 47:37.166
quite a bit more
when you get here.

47:37.250 --> 47:38.458
Okay.

47:38.542 --> 47:39.750
( giggles )

47:39.834 --> 47:41.166
Oh, hi.

47:41.250 --> 47:43.208
Well, uh, thanks for everything.

47:43.291 --> 47:44.291
Don't mention it.

47:44.375 --> 47:46.417
I'll, uh, I'll let you go, then.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.041
Okay, okay.
Good night.

47:48.125 --> 47:49.375
Good night.

48:20.625 --> 48:23.500
Some men are making money;

48:23.542 --> 48:25.917
I'm making ice.

48:31.083 --> 48:33.417
OLIVIA:
What does it look
like, Mommy?

48:33.500 --> 48:36.542
KATHERINE:
The house is the
color of the sky.

48:36.625 --> 48:40.291
It's all blue, with
windows everywhere
and shutters.

48:42.083 --> 48:45.417
It has a huge porch,
and five chimneys

48:45.500 --> 48:47.959
and it looks
like a castle.

48:48.041 --> 48:50.625
It's really
beautiful.

48:50.709 --> 48:54.250
( dog whining )

48:54.333 --> 48:55.834
Uh, hello.

48:55.917 --> 48:58.417
I thought we
were alone here.

48:58.500 --> 49:01.333
Have you come
to Maine for
Christmas?

49:01.417 --> 49:03.917
Um, no... I-I'm Terry McQuinn.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.625
Oh, you decided to stay?

49:06.709 --> 49:08.417
I did.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.333
Oh, I'm Katherine.
Nice to meet you.

49:11.583 --> 49:14.625
Uh, this is
my Olivia.

49:14.709 --> 49:16.583
Uh, that's Lawrence,
our family friend

49:16.667 --> 49:18.583
and driver.

49:18.667 --> 49:21.000
Uh, Livvy, this
is the nice man

49:21.083 --> 49:22.625
who opened our
house for us.

49:22.709 --> 49:27.125
I remember you,
Terry McQuinn.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.959
You do?

49:33.583 --> 49:35.583
Oh, oh, from-from the phone.

49:35.667 --> 49:39.917
Well, um... we'd better
go in and get settled.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Yes.

49:42.083 --> 49:44.208
It was a pleasure
to finally meet you.

49:44.291 --> 49:45.667
It's great to meet you.

49:45.750 --> 49:47.500
Hopefully, we'll see
you again soon.

49:47.583 --> 49:48.500
Bye.

49:48.583 --> 49:49.917
Bye.

50:09.417 --> 50:11.500
Do you want a sandwich?

50:11.583 --> 50:13.917
Take a sandwich.

50:27.125 --> 50:31.667
The changes to paragraphs one,
two, nine and 12 are perfect.

50:31.750 --> 50:32.667
( dog barks )

50:32.750 --> 50:34.875
However...

50:36.959 --> 50:38.333
Uh, however, I suggest

50:38.417 --> 50:41.542
we also make changes
to the terms of compensation.

50:41.625 --> 50:45.083
( barking )

50:53.166 --> 50:54.959
( barking continues )

50:58.375 --> 51:01.000
( wind howling )

51:04.667 --> 51:07.000
( whining )

51:44.208 --> 51:45.834
( turtledove cooing
in distance )

51:45.917 --> 51:47.875
( air hissing )

51:51.458 --> 51:52.667
It's just over there.

51:52.750 --> 51:53.917
Hello again.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.083
Good morning.

51:55.166 --> 51:56.792
It's Terry McQuinn.

51:56.875 --> 51:59.500
Yes, it is.

51:59.583 --> 52:01.542
Was everything
okay last night?

52:01.625 --> 52:03.583
Yeah.
You did so much work for us.

52:03.667 --> 52:05.375
I don't know
how to thank you.

52:05.458 --> 52:07.500
I had help.
It was good work.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.750
I... I enjoyed it.

52:09.834 --> 52:11.709
Good for the soul,
you mean.

52:11.792 --> 52:13.625
Ah, but not for the hands.

52:13.709 --> 52:15.792
Are we to blame
for that?

52:15.917 --> 52:18.000
Just my own stupidity.

52:18.083 --> 52:20.417
KATHERINE:
I was thinking on the way up,

52:20.500 --> 52:23.166
you must have worked here,
as a boy, with your father.

52:23.250 --> 52:26.000
You may have met my mother.

52:26.083 --> 52:29.709
Uh, my father only brought me
out here a couple of times.

52:29.792 --> 52:32.041
He didn't think I belonged
out here.

52:32.125 --> 52:34.500
( laughing gently )

52:34.583 --> 52:37.125
KATHERINE:
Livvy's been fascinated
by the gate

52:37.208 --> 52:39.709
from the moment
we first arrived.

52:39.792 --> 52:41.875
One of these keys opens it.

52:41.959 --> 52:43.458
Uh, I think
it was the small one.

52:43.542 --> 52:45.750
Oh...

52:45.834 --> 52:47.667
I dropped it.

52:58.792 --> 53:00.125
Here, Mommy.

53:00.208 --> 53:02.208
Wonderful!

53:02.291 --> 53:03.667
Thank you, love.

53:03.750 --> 53:05.208
You're welcome.

53:05.291 --> 53:08.709
Here, you may want to make
yourself a copy?

53:08.792 --> 53:12.208
Sure. I'll get this
right back to you.

53:12.291 --> 53:13.583
Okay.

53:13.667 --> 53:17.583
We've eaten,
but have you had any breakfast?

53:17.667 --> 53:20.208
Um... I have, thanks.

53:20.291 --> 53:23.208
But I was
actually hoping

53:23.291 --> 53:26.000
that you'd like to go with me
on a little adventure.

53:26.083 --> 53:27.500
An adventure.

53:27.583 --> 53:29.583
What did you have in mind?

53:29.667 --> 53:32.208
I'd like to show you something.

53:32.291 --> 53:34.834
Okay.

53:36.834 --> 53:38.959
TERRY:
Were you warm
enough last night?

53:39.041 --> 53:40.625
KATHERINE:
We were fine.

53:40.709 --> 53:43.500
I spent most of the night
walking from room to room.

53:43.583 --> 53:45.834
It was strange,
but I couldn't get over

53:45.917 --> 53:47.792
this incredible sense
of deja vu.

53:47.875 --> 53:51.250
My mother swears she
never brought me here,

53:51.333 --> 53:53.208
but she revises history.

53:53.291 --> 53:55.458
She just told me about the place
last month,

53:55.542 --> 53:57.667
before she and her new husband
left for Europe.

53:57.750 --> 54:01.709
I think it was 'cause
she felt guilty.

54:05.709 --> 54:07.667
( indistinct conversation )

54:09.291 --> 54:10.750
Uh... you know what?

54:10.834 --> 54:12.542
I, uh, I think I made
a wrong turn here.

54:12.625 --> 54:13.667
I'm sorry.

54:24.083 --> 54:27.542
KATHERINE:
Here, look what Olivia
found last night.

54:27.625 --> 54:31.333
Uh, Lawrence said
they're someone's fingerprints.

54:31.417 --> 54:32.875
A little Sherlock Holmes

54:32.959 --> 54:35.000
must've stayed in
the cottage once.

54:35.083 --> 54:37.125
( laughs gently )

54:37.208 --> 54:38.917
Here it is.

54:44.792 --> 54:47.125
( switch clanks,
generator whirls )

54:51.667 --> 54:53.542
Oh, Terry!

54:53.625 --> 54:56.083
A carousel!

54:56.166 --> 54:59.625
Olivia, what a special
surprise for us.

54:59.709 --> 55:01.000
Thank you.

55:01.083 --> 55:02.709
Olivia, there's
a horse here

55:02.792 --> 55:04.959
that's been waiting
for you to ride.

55:05.041 --> 55:06.166
Really?
Uh-huh.

55:06.250 --> 55:07.625
Come on.

55:07.709 --> 55:09.375
( chuckling )

55:09.458 --> 55:11.333
I'm gonna lift you up, okay?

55:11.417 --> 55:12.667
Okay!

55:12.750 --> 55:16.041
All righty,
here you go.

55:16.125 --> 55:17.750
There you go.

55:19.375 --> 55:22.208
This one has
a pretty mane.

55:25.417 --> 55:27.583
Can you feel that?

55:27.667 --> 55:29.667
Yeah, it feels wavy.

55:29.792 --> 55:31.000
( laughing )

55:31.083 --> 55:33.709
Bumpy.

55:33.792 --> 55:36.166
I want to go, Mommy.

55:36.250 --> 55:37.834
Okay, Teapot.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.041
Well, a friend of mine
runs this place,

55:40.125 --> 55:42.834
but he doesn't seem
to be around.

55:42.917 --> 55:44.417
( lever clanks )

55:44.500 --> 55:46.417
( festive music playing )

55:46.500 --> 55:47.792
Oh!
Oh!

55:47.875 --> 55:49.625
( both laughing )

55:49.709 --> 55:51.083
( laughing )

55:53.208 --> 55:55.917
( Olivia laughing )

55:56.000 --> 55:58.083
It's a magical
carousel ride.

56:06.709 --> 56:08.667
( Olivia's laughter echoing )

56:13.125 --> 56:15.709
TERRY:
So how long's the cottage
been in your family?

56:15.792 --> 56:19.166
My understanding is that my
mother's grandfather bought it

56:19.250 --> 56:23.166
after making a fortune inventing
a machine that made shoelaces.

56:23.250 --> 56:25.667
Shoelaces? Amazing!

56:28.458 --> 56:30.208
Does she see anything?

56:30.291 --> 56:33.000
Not anymore.

56:33.083 --> 56:35.959
Uh, up until the first year,
she could see bright lights.

56:36.041 --> 56:38.000
I was teaching her colors,

56:38.083 --> 56:39.667
but we never finished.

56:39.750 --> 56:42.083
I don't know, Terry.

56:42.166 --> 56:45.417
There's a lot that
is sad all around us,

56:45.500 --> 56:47.792
but I'm trying
to teach Olivia

56:47.875 --> 56:50.792
that the world
is still beautiful.

56:50.875 --> 56:52.625
I mean, bad things happen,

56:52.709 --> 56:56.333
but it doesn't make a carousel
ride any less magical.

56:56.417 --> 56:58.917
I loved the carousel,
Terry McQuinn.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.458
Well, I'm glad you did.

57:00.542 --> 57:03.000
You know, when
I was a little boy

57:03.083 --> 57:06.834
the carousel was my favorite
thing in the world.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.041
What's your favorite thing now
in the world?

57:10.125 --> 57:12.792
( sighs )

57:12.875 --> 57:15.375
That's a good question.

57:15.458 --> 57:18.792
TERRY:
I guess, Olivia, that...

57:18.875 --> 57:21.750
that I would have to say that
my favorite thing in the world

57:21.834 --> 57:24.458
is the water.

57:24.542 --> 57:27.500
OLIVIA:
What does the water
look like here?

57:27.583 --> 57:30.875
Uh... it seems
to go out forever.

57:30.959 --> 57:33.834
And there's this island
right out in the middle.

57:33.917 --> 57:34.834
It's called
Pumpkin Island.

57:34.917 --> 57:36.083
Oh, let's go there,
Mommy!

57:36.125 --> 57:39.041
Oh, sweetheart,
it's wintertime.

57:39.125 --> 57:40.458
It's much too cold.

57:40.500 --> 57:43.125
I'm not cold.
Are you cold, Terry?

57:43.208 --> 57:46.083
Well... no.

57:46.166 --> 57:48.000
As a matter of fact,
I'm not cold.

57:48.083 --> 57:50.542
Please, Mommy?

57:50.625 --> 57:52.166
We'll see.

57:52.250 --> 57:54.375
Okay, we'll see.

57:54.458 --> 57:56.208
( laughs quietly )

58:19.208 --> 58:21.875
( sandpaper scratching )

58:37.834 --> 58:41.041
You grew up in
a beautiful place.

58:41.125 --> 58:43.291
I ran away from here.

58:43.375 --> 58:45.583
To find fame and fortune?

58:45.667 --> 58:48.125
Oh, I don't know
anymore.

58:48.208 --> 58:51.792
Just to be someplace
far away from Maine.

58:51.875 --> 58:54.375
You know,
when I was a kid,

58:54.458 --> 58:56.500
I was so determined
to leave here,

58:56.583 --> 58:59.417
and now that I'm back, I...

58:59.500 --> 59:03.291
the reasons why I left are
becoming less clear to me.

59:03.375 --> 59:07.500
Don't we all try to escape where
we came from one way or another?

59:07.583 --> 59:08.583
You think so?

59:08.667 --> 59:10.917
Yeah.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.500
My mother had all
the money in the world,

59:14.583 --> 59:16.667
and yet she was unhappy.

59:16.750 --> 59:21.458
And all I wanted to do was
to separate myself from that--

59:21.542 --> 59:23.458
do something meaningful.

59:23.542 --> 59:24.625
And what was that?

59:24.709 --> 59:26.834
Social work.

59:26.917 --> 59:31.083
A far cry from
Park Avenue.

59:31.166 --> 59:32.875
You seem content.

59:32.959 --> 59:35.834
Yeah, that's 'cause of Olivia.

59:35.917 --> 59:38.041
She's a beautiful little girl.

59:38.125 --> 59:39.500
Yeah, she is.

59:39.583 --> 59:42.333
When I first met her,
she was nine months old,

59:42.417 --> 59:45.250
and she'd already been
in four foster homes.

59:47.417 --> 59:52.000
Nobody wanted a blind baby,
not even my ex-fiancé.

59:52.083 --> 59:53.625
I took her in.

59:53.709 --> 59:55.333
Fell in love.

59:55.417 --> 59:57.417
I couldn't give her away.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.542
She's lucky to have you.

59:59.625 --> 1:00:02.333
I'm the lucky one.

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:06.291
You know, Katherine,

1:00:06.375 --> 1:00:08.166
doing this work

1:00:08.250 --> 1:00:10.542
for you and Olivia...

1:00:10.625 --> 1:00:13.375
it's the nicest thing
I've done in a long time.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:17.375
( laughs )

1:00:17.458 --> 1:00:18.959
Should I give it a try?

1:00:19.041 --> 1:00:21.709
Sure, go on.

1:00:21.792 --> 1:00:23.250
Be careful.

1:00:23.333 --> 1:00:24.917
( laughing ):
Okay!

1:00:27.083 --> 1:00:27.667
How is it?

1:00:27.750 --> 1:00:29.375
This is great!

1:00:29.458 --> 1:00:31.583
( laughing )

1:00:31.667 --> 1:00:33.917
Listen, uh, tonight, in the city

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.709
they're doing Dylan Thomas's

1:00:35.792 --> 1:00:37.709
A Child's Christmas
in Wales.

1:00:37.792 --> 1:00:41.083
Would you like to go with us?

1:00:41.166 --> 1:00:43.917
If-If you're not too tired
from working.

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.333
I won't be too tired.

1:00:45.417 --> 1:00:46.542
Good.

1:00:46.625 --> 1:00:49.083
We'll pick you up at 7:30.

1:00:49.166 --> 1:00:51.208
Do I need my tux?

1:00:51.291 --> 1:00:52.750
Absolutely.

1:00:52.834 --> 1:00:54.000
( laughing )

1:01:17.083 --> 1:01:19.000
OLIVIA:
♪ Over the hills we go

1:01:19.083 --> 1:01:22.625
♪ Laughing all the way,
ha, ha, ha! ♪

1:01:23.709 --> 1:01:26.250
Someone told me I might, uh...

1:01:26.333 --> 1:01:28.208
find some men down here

1:01:28.291 --> 1:01:30.458
to help clear the ice
off the cottage roofs.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:32.625
I guess not.

1:01:32.709 --> 1:01:34.208
We can ride the elevator
up from here, Olivia.

1:01:34.291 --> 1:01:35.583
Mmm! That'll be fun.

1:01:35.667 --> 1:01:37.709
That'll be fun.

1:01:43.166 --> 1:01:44.583
Uh, you go ahead.

1:01:44.667 --> 1:01:46.000
I'll be right there.

1:01:46.083 --> 1:01:47.250
Okay.

1:01:47.333 --> 1:01:48.959
Mommy...
Mm-hmm?

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:53.166
Excuse me.

1:01:53.250 --> 1:01:56.458
Would any of you like
to work for good wages?

1:02:01.166 --> 1:02:04.625
It's, uh...
ten dollars an hour.

1:02:04.709 --> 1:02:06.291
More if you stay
through Christmas.

1:02:06.375 --> 1:02:09.208
Can I take
some of these men with me?

1:02:09.291 --> 1:02:11.750
Sure.

1:02:11.834 --> 1:02:14.000
I'll pick you up
here in the morning.

1:02:14.083 --> 1:02:15.625
What time?

1:02:15.709 --> 1:02:17.625
7:00 okay?

1:02:17.709 --> 1:02:20.125
Yeh.

1:02:20.208 --> 1:02:22.166
Thank you.

1:02:36.375 --> 1:02:37.792
Yeah, Wendy. It's Terry.

1:02:37.875 --> 1:02:41.125
Uh... yeah, I got
your message last night.

1:02:41.208 --> 1:02:44.208
When you get in
and you get this message...

1:02:44.291 --> 1:02:46.458
uh, tell Sanders
I'm drafting

1:02:46.542 --> 1:02:48.834
a new version as we speak,

1:02:48.917 --> 1:02:50.750
and I'll get it
to you right away.

1:02:50.834 --> 1:02:51.834
Okay. Bye.

1:03:05.917 --> 1:03:07.875
( Jack barks )

1:03:21.625 --> 1:03:23.458
Whenever you're ready.

1:03:23.542 --> 1:03:26.291
KATHERINE:
It's great
that you found those men.

1:03:26.375 --> 1:03:27.834
What men?

1:03:27.917 --> 1:03:29.166
Terry has some nice men

1:03:29.250 --> 1:03:31.166
cleaning the
roof of the cottage.

1:03:31.250 --> 1:03:32.166
Why?

1:03:32.542 --> 1:03:36.000
Well, so that the roof
doesn't leak and fall in.

1:03:36.083 --> 1:03:39.333
It's going to be
freezing out there.

1:03:39.417 --> 1:03:41.375
I'm not cold.

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.750
Oh, that's right.

1:03:43.834 --> 1:03:45.000
Terry, I didn't
tell you.

1:03:45.083 --> 1:03:46.375
Olivia doesn't
get cold.

1:03:46.458 --> 1:03:47.834
Do you?

1:03:47.917 --> 1:03:49.000
OLIVIA:
Never.

1:03:49.083 --> 1:03:52.875
No. Well, not even
the other night,

1:03:52.959 --> 1:03:55.375
when you and Jack
were out walking?

1:03:55.458 --> 1:03:58.583
Olivia, were you out
by yourself?

1:03:58.667 --> 1:04:01.125
No, Mommy. Jack was with me.

1:04:01.208 --> 1:04:03.291
Honey, you know
you're not meant to go out

1:04:03.375 --> 1:04:04.500
without me or Lawrence.

1:04:04.583 --> 1:04:07.458
I'm sorry. Jack
wanted to take a walk.

1:04:07.542 --> 1:04:09.959
KATHERINE:
Jack always wants
to take a walk.

1:04:10.041 --> 1:04:11.625
We'll talk
about it later.

1:04:11.709 --> 1:04:14.250
I think Jack really
likes it here.

1:04:14.333 --> 1:04:15.417
( laughs )

1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:16.583
I do, too.

1:04:16.667 --> 1:04:19.417
How would you like
to live here?

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:23.083
But what about all my friends
in New York?

1:04:23.166 --> 1:04:26.041
We'll make new friends
here in Maine.

1:04:26.125 --> 1:04:28.250
Terry is our friend already.

1:04:28.333 --> 1:04:30.041
Hold on.

1:04:33.667 --> 1:04:36.250
OLIVIA:
Would you live here with us,
Terry McQuinn?

1:04:36.333 --> 1:04:38.917
We have 12 big bedrooms.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.583
I counted them.

1:05:07.959 --> 1:05:12.166
( laughing ):
I feel like the
Swiss Family Robinson.

1:05:12.250 --> 1:05:14.917
Just tie it off up there.

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:22.250
May I lift you out, Olivia?

1:05:22.333 --> 1:05:23.959
Lift me, Terry.

1:05:24.041 --> 1:05:25.125
( chuckling ):
Come here.

1:05:26.667 --> 1:05:28.166
Aw.

1:05:28.250 --> 1:05:30.542
Hey, you know what?

1:05:30.625 --> 1:05:33.291
If I was Jack,

1:05:33.375 --> 1:05:36.917
I'd be so glad to have
found a little girl like you.

1:05:36.959 --> 1:05:38.583
Blind like me?

1:05:40.125 --> 1:05:42.583
Exactly like you.

1:05:44.709 --> 1:05:47.041
TERRY:
Come on, Jack.

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:54.875
Let's go.

1:06:08.375 --> 1:06:11.375
( Jack barking )

1:06:13.166 --> 1:06:14.709
( sniffing )

1:06:14.792 --> 1:06:17.083
Mommy, Jack found something.

1:06:17.166 --> 1:06:18.250
What is it?

1:06:25.166 --> 1:06:28.041
"Our beloved dog, Sally."

1:06:28.125 --> 1:06:29.542
What is it, Mommy?

1:06:29.625 --> 1:06:32.166
A dog is buried here.

1:06:34.125 --> 1:06:35.375
Sally.

1:06:35.458 --> 1:06:37.917
My mother talked
about a dog I had

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.041
when I was
a little girl.

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:43.000
I don't remember the dog,
but her name was Sally.

1:06:43.083 --> 1:06:45.166
OLIVIA:
It's your dog, Mommy.

1:06:45.250 --> 1:06:47.333
That's why Jack and I found it.

1:06:47.417 --> 1:06:49.667
No, darling. It couldn't be.

1:06:49.750 --> 1:06:51.083
Let's go, Olivia.

1:06:51.166 --> 1:06:53.500
We should start
walking back.

1:06:57.792 --> 1:06:59.959
She's so independent.

1:07:00.041 --> 1:07:03.583
KATHERINE:
Olivia will always be the most
important person to me.

1:07:03.667 --> 1:07:08.083
It's funny, I...
I don't know
where it comes from--

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:10.583
the closeness I feel.

1:07:10.667 --> 1:07:15.000
KATHERINE:
Olivia has taught me
to live in the present.

1:07:15.083 --> 1:07:18.333
It's this great gift that
small children give to you.

1:07:18.417 --> 1:07:20.583
There is no future to a child.

1:07:20.667 --> 1:07:24.000
There is only what is here
and now in front of you.

1:08:03.792 --> 1:08:05.750
( wind howling )

1:08:14.792 --> 1:08:17.250
OLIVIA:
What's happening?

1:08:17.333 --> 1:08:20.709
Terry, be careful.

1:08:20.792 --> 1:08:22.166
The water's freezing.

1:08:24.709 --> 1:08:27.375
KATHERINE:
Terry!

1:08:27.458 --> 1:08:30.333
Terry... oh!

1:08:30.417 --> 1:08:33.125
What's going on?

1:08:33.208 --> 1:08:35.166
Where is he?

1:08:35.250 --> 1:08:37.250
Is he in the water?

1:08:38.750 --> 1:08:40.542
( grunting )

1:08:50.333 --> 1:08:52.625
Don't move!

1:09:01.667 --> 1:09:04.166
OLIVIA:
Where is Terry?

1:09:04.250 --> 1:09:06.125
Is he all right?

1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:08.834
( grunts )

1:09:08.959 --> 1:09:10.875
( panting )

1:09:10.959 --> 1:09:12.875
KATHERINE:
Come here, baby.

1:09:12.959 --> 1:09:15.083
Put this on.

1:09:20.583 --> 1:09:23.583
( straining )

1:09:23.667 --> 1:09:25.625
My hands are frozen.

1:09:27.333 --> 1:09:29.250
( groans )

1:09:29.333 --> 1:09:31.500
Okay. Sit down, baby.

1:09:34.250 --> 1:09:36.333
( grunting loudly )

1:09:42.625 --> 1:09:45.583
Okay, don't worry,
everything will be okay.

1:09:45.667 --> 1:09:47.667
( grunts )

1:09:47.750 --> 1:09:49.333
( panting )

1:10:00.458 --> 1:10:01.166
( Katherine grunting )

1:10:01.458 --> 1:10:02.667
KATHERINE:
We'll be home soon.

1:10:02.750 --> 1:10:05.291
But I need you to lie
next to Terry

1:10:05.375 --> 1:10:07.208
to help keep him warm.

1:10:09.458 --> 1:10:11.583
( grunting )

1:10:15.834 --> 1:10:17.834
( continues grunting )

1:10:31.333 --> 1:10:32.875
Here, grab the rope, will ya?!

1:10:34.875 --> 1:10:37.709
( grunting and groaning )

1:11:00.959 --> 1:11:01.875
( groans )

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:58.291
( knock on door )

1:11:58.375 --> 1:11:59.500
Come in.

1:12:02.709 --> 1:12:04.375
Feeling better?

1:12:04.458 --> 1:12:08.333
Yeah. A hot shower
thawed me out pretty good.

1:12:08.417 --> 1:12:09.417
Yeah, thank you.

1:12:09.792 --> 1:12:12.083
Good, good. One of the men
would like to talk to you.

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:13.834
Sure.

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:24.375
He's driving us back.

1:12:25.750 --> 1:12:27.500
You dry enough?

1:12:27.583 --> 1:12:28.959
Yeah.

1:12:29.041 --> 1:12:30.500
( clears throat )

1:12:32.542 --> 1:12:36.125
Uh, the other guys wanted me
to ask you for our money.

1:12:36.208 --> 1:12:39.166
I said we could wait
if you can't pay it now.

1:12:39.250 --> 1:12:41.834
No, no, no, of course, sure.

1:12:41.917 --> 1:12:45.917
Um... will a hundred
for each of you be enough?

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.417
Oh, yeah, more than enough.

1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:51.875
Okay, well, it's still
a little wet from the lake.

1:12:51.959 --> 1:12:53.500
Here you go.

1:12:53.583 --> 1:12:54.959
Thank you.

1:12:55.041 --> 1:12:56.083
No, wait, please.

1:13:00.583 --> 1:13:05.750
Do you remember the man
who was caretaker here?

1:13:08.583 --> 1:13:10.959
You knew him once.

1:13:11.041 --> 1:13:14.834
I'm... his son.

1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:24.083
You and I have been
gone a long time.

1:13:24.166 --> 1:13:26.792
But we've
both come back.

1:13:29.667 --> 1:13:32.417
In the hospital, there are
presents for the children.

1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:36.125
They have your
name on them.

1:13:36.208 --> 1:13:37.875
My name?

1:13:37.959 --> 1:13:41.625
Charles Wentworth.

1:13:47.083 --> 1:13:49.583
Hey...

1:13:49.667 --> 1:13:51.583
I won't be back tomorrow.

1:13:51.667 --> 1:13:53.208
No, no. I-I can use the help.

1:13:53.291 --> 1:13:55.125
I'm sorry.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.667
( whines softly )

1:14:13.834 --> 1:14:15.125
( knock at door )

1:14:15.208 --> 1:14:16.959
Come on in.

1:14:18.166 --> 1:14:20.125
( wind whistling )

1:14:22.625 --> 1:14:23.792
( sniffles )

1:14:24.208 --> 1:14:27.250
You sure California can survive
this long without you, son?

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.625
I'm trying to help your brother.

1:14:33.709 --> 1:14:36.125
Guess he couldn't handle it.

1:14:36.208 --> 1:14:38.709
I want to show you something.

1:14:40.125 --> 1:14:41.625
Come on.

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:50.208
He called me for
a ride this morning.

1:14:51.208 --> 1:14:55.542
It's the first thing he's
asked me for in five years.

1:14:58.959 --> 1:15:01.500
I don't want anything
to happen to him.

1:15:01.583 --> 1:15:03.083
I don't want to lose him.

1:15:03.166 --> 1:15:04.667
He was my brother long before

1:15:04.792 --> 1:15:07.625
he had anything to do
with these people out here.

1:15:11.208 --> 1:15:15.208
Warren, we have no right
to keep them apart.

1:15:15.291 --> 1:15:17.083
When your father
first told me

1:15:17.166 --> 1:15:19.291
that she might be
coming up here,

1:15:19.375 --> 1:15:21.917
I asked him if he knew
what kind of woman

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.291
she had grown into,
and, of course, he didn't.

1:15:25.375 --> 1:15:27.667
I'm worried that she might
be like her mother.

1:15:27.750 --> 1:15:29.375
She might hurt him.

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.125
Can you understand that?

1:15:37.792 --> 1:15:41.458
I took them for a ride
on the carousel.

1:15:41.542 --> 1:15:43.458
I know. I was there.

1:15:48.542 --> 1:15:51.417
You may have been
right all along, Terry,

1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:53.166
but I'm still concerned

1:15:53.250 --> 1:15:55.667
that my brother
won't be able to face her.

1:16:08.166 --> 1:16:08.959
We sat in the car

1:16:09.333 --> 1:16:12.333
and waited for you
to come back that night.

1:16:14.375 --> 1:16:17.000
Yeah, well, I couldn't
live with myself.

1:16:17.125 --> 1:16:18.333
It was an accident.

1:16:18.417 --> 1:16:22.500
It was a mother and her child.

1:16:22.583 --> 1:16:25.375
I came back here,
though.

1:16:25.458 --> 1:16:30.291
I used to sleep on
people's boats
in the harbor.

1:16:30.375 --> 1:16:35.709
I hid in the woods
by the golf course.

1:16:35.792 --> 1:16:38.208
I was here, I was here
hiding in the pump house

1:16:38.291 --> 1:16:39.375
when the movers came.

1:16:39.458 --> 1:16:42.667
I watched them.

1:16:44.417 --> 1:16:47.333
I never came back here
after that.

1:16:50.709 --> 1:16:53.625
They took everything important.

1:16:53.709 --> 1:16:56.667
Not everything.

1:16:58.875 --> 1:17:03.333
My father saved some photographs
of you with your daughter.

1:17:23.417 --> 1:17:26.792
( laughing )

1:17:50.792 --> 1:17:51.792
Ow!

1:18:39.792 --> 1:18:42.625
So every year on December 25th,

1:18:42.709 --> 1:18:45.542
we celebrate
the birth of Christ.

1:18:45.625 --> 1:18:47.333
"C" is for Christmas.

1:18:47.417 --> 1:18:50.709
What do you want
for Christmas, Olivia?

1:18:50.792 --> 1:18:51.834
I don't know.

1:18:51.917 --> 1:18:54.959
Hmm. Well, I'll bet
Santa Claus knows.

1:18:55.041 --> 1:18:59.333
All right, I better get this
angel into her pajamas.

1:18:59.375 --> 1:19:00.875
Just a little while more.

1:19:00.959 --> 1:19:01.875
It's late.

1:19:01.959 --> 1:19:03.667
You've had a busy day.

1:19:03.750 --> 1:19:05.083
A live-over
day, Terry.

1:19:05.166 --> 1:19:08.125
For me, too.

1:19:13.667 --> 1:19:15.125
Good night.

1:19:15.208 --> 1:19:17.291
Bye, bye, pumpkin.

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.041
( wind whistling )

1:19:30.709 --> 1:19:32.542
( sighs )

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:37.709
( phone ringing )

1:19:37.792 --> 1:19:38.917
Hello.

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.375
Terry, it's Bill.

1:19:40.458 --> 1:19:41.792
Listen, I've been
all over Wendy

1:19:41.875 --> 1:19:43.792
to get those contracts
back from you.

1:19:43.875 --> 1:19:45.458
Yeah. I'm working on them.

1:19:45.542 --> 1:19:47.709
Well, she says she sent them
to you days ago.

1:19:47.792 --> 1:19:49.166
I'm doing them right now.

1:19:49.250 --> 1:19:51.000
( knocking )

1:19:51.083 --> 1:19:53.000
Listen, I know it's not
a good time, but...

1:19:53.083 --> 1:19:54.208
Look, they're almost done.

1:19:54.667 --> 1:19:57.208
( whispering):
You're busy.
I'll just leave this.

1:19:57.291 --> 1:19:58.667
No, no, no. Come in.

1:19:58.750 --> 1:20:03.625
Uh, Bill, uh, I, I'll get
'em to you tomorrow.

1:20:05.208 --> 1:20:08.667
Some pie.

1:20:08.750 --> 1:20:09.792
Thank you.

1:20:10.166 --> 1:20:14.458
Lawrence survived it
but he has a cast-iron stomach.

1:20:15.250 --> 1:20:18.041
I've got a fork here somewhere.

1:20:18.125 --> 1:20:24.166
You fixed the sled here
with your father's tools.

1:20:24.250 --> 1:20:27.542
Yeah, anything that doesn't fall
apart an hour after I fix it,

1:20:27.625 --> 1:20:28.667
is a miracle.

1:20:28.750 --> 1:20:29.917
If my father was here,

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:31.709
he could do it
five times better

1:20:31.792 --> 1:20:33.917
in one fifth the time.

1:20:38.250 --> 1:20:39.834
It's good.

1:20:49.917 --> 1:20:52.875
I've been thinking about what
you said to me...

1:20:54.625 --> 1:20:57.625
...about how

1:20:57.709 --> 1:21:00.625
Olivia has taught
you to live in the present.

1:21:02.250 --> 1:21:04.166
How do you live?

1:21:04.250 --> 1:21:06.959
The future, always.

1:21:07.041 --> 1:21:10.208
You are only as good
as your next deal.

1:21:10.333 --> 1:21:12.834
That's a tough
way to live.

1:21:12.917 --> 1:21:14.792
Yeah. I know.

1:21:17.125 --> 1:21:20.083
I didn't used to think so.

1:21:27.875 --> 1:21:31.542
This is the future, too.

1:21:31.625 --> 1:21:34.500
Being here with you.

1:21:34.583 --> 1:21:35.792
What do you mean?

1:21:40.583 --> 1:21:44.208
I never knew it, but...

1:21:44.291 --> 1:21:47.542
I've been waiting
a long time for this

1:21:47.625 --> 1:21:49.667
and I've been
looking for you.

1:21:49.750 --> 1:21:53.792
Where?

1:21:53.875 --> 1:21:55.834
Everywhere.

1:22:02.667 --> 1:22:07.041
Maybe I shouldn't
have done that.

1:22:07.125 --> 1:22:09.709
No, no.

1:22:09.834 --> 1:22:12.291
It was the right thing to do.

1:22:12.375 --> 1:22:15.291
You sure?

1:22:15.375 --> 1:22:17.917
I'm sure.

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:21.542
This is hard for me.

1:22:28.333 --> 1:22:31.542
When I adopted Olivia,

1:22:31.625 --> 1:22:36.166
I built this small world for us

1:22:36.250 --> 1:22:39.959
where I could love
and protect her.

1:22:40.041 --> 1:22:44.917
I realize I've been
protecting myself

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.792
and I'm scared
to let anyone in.

1:22:49.458 --> 1:22:53.709
Katherine, that's
what my father did.

1:22:53.792 --> 1:22:56.667
He built this small world
for himself.

1:22:56.750 --> 1:22:59.667
Only he worked
himself to death

1:22:59.750 --> 1:23:04.041
because he never let anyone in.

1:23:04.125 --> 1:23:06.834
Not even his own son.

1:23:09.875 --> 1:23:12.792
Maybe he was afraid.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.375
I don't know.

1:23:19.166 --> 1:23:20.208
In my way,

1:23:20.291 --> 1:23:22.667
I think for the last 20 years

1:23:22.750 --> 1:23:25.875
I've been doing the exact
same thing

1:23:25.959 --> 1:23:30.083
and I don't want to continue
to make that mistake.

1:23:30.166 --> 1:23:32.750
You won't.

1:23:50.250 --> 1:23:53.959
OLIVIA:
I'm in my pajamas,

1:23:54.041 --> 1:23:55.709
all ready for bed.

1:23:55.792 --> 1:23:58.166
Aren't you something?

1:23:59.792 --> 1:24:04.041
I want Terry to tell me
a story tonight.

1:24:04.125 --> 1:24:07.709
Oh, uh...

1:24:07.792 --> 1:24:11.000
well, I've never told
a bedtime story before.

1:24:13.208 --> 1:24:16.083
I think I have
an idea.

1:24:16.166 --> 1:24:17.458
You ready?

1:24:17.542 --> 1:24:18.458
Yep.

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.166
You ready to try it?

1:24:20.250 --> 1:24:21.458
Let's go, then.

1:24:21.542 --> 1:24:22.834
Ticklish?

1:24:22.917 --> 1:24:25.125
Yeah, ticklish!

1:24:25.208 --> 1:24:26.792
Ticklish!

1:24:29.208 --> 1:24:33.041
Look who's sleeping.

1:24:39.041 --> 1:24:41.709
( whispering ):
I told her a story
about a bird

1:24:41.792 --> 1:24:43.667
who invades mailboxes,

1:24:43.750 --> 1:24:47.083
and carries away
all the unwanted mail.

1:24:47.166 --> 1:24:50.000
The bills and the sad letters.

1:24:50.041 --> 1:24:52.750
There was a child

1:24:52.834 --> 1:24:54.166
who befriended the bird

1:24:54.250 --> 1:24:57.041
and together they read
all the letters.

1:24:57.125 --> 1:25:00.125
Rewrote them
and took out all the sad parts.

1:25:02.417 --> 1:25:03.792
How does it end?

1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:07.250
I'm not sure.

1:25:07.333 --> 1:25:10.709
Maybe it's better that way.

1:25:18.166 --> 1:25:21.834
For the last two nights,
she's wanted to sleep here.

1:25:52.250 --> 1:25:53.750
Thank you.

1:25:57.667 --> 1:25:58.917
Would you do
something for me?

1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:00.083
What?

1:26:00.166 --> 1:26:02.417
I want you to go back
in your mind

1:26:02.500 --> 1:26:04.083
to your earliest memory.

1:26:04.166 --> 1:26:06.500
I don't have a good memory.

1:26:06.583 --> 1:26:07.875
Just try.

1:26:07.959 --> 1:26:09.542
Everybody says that.

1:26:09.625 --> 1:26:12.291
Just try.
You have to try.

1:26:12.375 --> 1:26:14.208
( both chuckle )

1:26:14.291 --> 1:26:20.417
I remember our family doctor
sitting on the end of my bed

1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:22.500
telling me
I had measles.

1:26:22.583 --> 1:26:24.000
( chuckles )

1:26:24.083 --> 1:26:28.333
I must have been about six
or seven, I guess.

1:26:29.709 --> 1:26:32.333
Go back farther.

1:26:36.166 --> 1:26:43.333
I remember standing in the fog
on my first day of school.

1:26:43.417 --> 1:26:47.834
I was wearing my shiny shoes.

1:26:47.917 --> 1:26:50.458
My mother said I called
my patent leather shoes

1:26:50.542 --> 1:26:52.542
"my shiny shoes."

1:26:52.625 --> 1:26:54.834
I loved them.

1:26:54.917 --> 1:26:56.125
Mm...

1:26:56.208 --> 1:26:59.208
I remember those shoes.

1:27:00.417 --> 1:27:02.834
Of course you do.

1:27:02.917 --> 1:27:06.208
You were standing
right beside me.

1:27:08.417 --> 1:27:11.208
The shoes had elastic straps

1:27:11.291 --> 1:27:15.208
that held them on.

1:27:15.291 --> 1:27:19.166
The right strap was loose
and the shoe kept falling off.

1:27:19.250 --> 1:27:22.500
( gasps )

1:27:22.583 --> 1:27:26.125
You couldn't know that.

1:27:26.208 --> 1:27:28.959
Tell me how
you know that.

1:27:32.125 --> 1:27:34.083
I, I sprained my ankle

1:27:34.166 --> 1:27:39.417
and the bandage had stretched
the elastic on my right shoe.

1:27:39.500 --> 1:27:41.000
You couldn't have known that.

1:27:53.667 --> 1:27:55.917
On my ninth birthday

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.834
I was given
a fingerprinting kit.

1:27:59.917 --> 1:28:01.000
This is you, Katherine.

1:28:03.041 --> 1:28:06.667
You were here,
in this house.

1:28:06.750 --> 1:28:09.709
I knew you when
you were a little girl.

1:28:09.792 --> 1:28:12.083
And this is

1:28:12.166 --> 1:28:14.333
your father.

1:28:14.417 --> 1:28:17.166
You were here with him.

1:28:17.291 --> 1:28:19.166
What are you talking about?

1:28:19.250 --> 1:28:21.333
When you were a little girl,
you came to Rose Point

1:28:21.417 --> 1:28:22.709
with your parents
for the holidays.

1:28:22.792 --> 1:28:25.208
No, I, I, I never came here.

1:28:25.291 --> 1:28:27.208
I never knew my father.

1:28:27.291 --> 1:28:29.542
Yes, you did.

1:28:29.625 --> 1:28:33.625
Your mother divorced him
and she took you away.

1:28:33.709 --> 1:28:35.959
But he's still here.

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:38.041
You're not making any sense.

1:28:38.125 --> 1:28:39.125
Katherine,

1:28:39.208 --> 1:28:41.125
the man who helped us
the other day,

1:28:41.208 --> 1:28:43.166
the one who carried you
from the boat.

1:28:43.250 --> 1:28:44.583
His name is Charles.

1:28:44.667 --> 1:28:45.583
Stop it, Terry!

1:28:45.667 --> 1:28:47.375
Stop it!

1:28:47.458 --> 1:28:49.041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:28:49.125 --> 1:28:49.959
Stop it!

1:28:50.291 --> 1:28:52.208
I've been wanting
to tell you, Katherine.

1:28:52.291 --> 1:28:53.500
You didn't say anything!

1:28:53.583 --> 1:28:55.500
I was trying
to do the right thing.

1:28:55.583 --> 1:28:57.000
By keeping it from me?

1:28:57.083 --> 1:28:58.333
I feel like a fool.

1:28:58.417 --> 1:29:01.583
I went on and on
about never having been here.

1:29:01.667 --> 1:29:03.041
I'm so sorry.

1:29:03.125 --> 1:29:03.959
You knew.

1:29:04.250 --> 1:29:07.125
My own father stood
right next to me

1:29:07.208 --> 1:29:08.208
and you knew?

1:29:08.291 --> 1:29:10.458
I was just trying
to respect his wishes.

1:29:10.542 --> 1:29:12.083
And what about mine?

1:29:12.166 --> 1:29:14.083
Did you think I wouldn't care?

1:29:14.166 --> 1:29:16.083
I, I didn't know what to think!

1:29:16.166 --> 1:29:17.500
There wasn't any plan.

1:29:17.583 --> 1:29:19.291
When you first got here,
I wanted to tell you,

1:29:19.375 --> 1:29:21.208
but then you seemed so happy.

1:29:21.250 --> 1:29:22.417
I was worried
it would upset you.

1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:23.709
Please...

1:29:23.792 --> 1:29:26.083
Just go, Terry! Just go!

1:29:33.667 --> 1:29:35.250
( door slams )

1:29:35.333 --> 1:29:36.959
Yeah, uh-huh.

1:29:37.041 --> 1:29:41.166
I seem to have settled
everything here.

1:29:41.250 --> 1:29:43.125
I'm on a flight
this afternoon.

1:29:43.208 --> 1:29:45.417
I'll be in the office
in the morning.

1:29:45.500 --> 1:29:46.417
WOMAN:
All right.

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:47.458
I'll see you then.

1:29:47.542 --> 1:29:48.500
Bye.

1:29:52.417 --> 1:29:55.000
( dog barks )

1:30:12.750 --> 1:30:14.542
Hello, Olivia.

1:30:14.625 --> 1:30:16.041
Terry!

1:30:21.500 --> 1:30:24.208
I wanted to come
and say good-bye.

1:30:24.291 --> 1:30:25.166
I'm sorry.

1:30:25.250 --> 1:30:27.667
I have to go home now.

1:30:27.750 --> 1:30:31.208
It's time
to get back to my job.

1:30:52.750 --> 1:30:55.083
Good-bye, Terry McQuinn.

1:31:10.792 --> 1:31:13.250
Merry Christmas.

1:31:17.500 --> 1:31:19.333
( Jack whines )

1:31:32.917 --> 1:31:35.166
( siren wails in distance )

1:31:39.959 --> 1:31:41.792
Charles!

1:31:50.500 --> 1:31:52.834
I'm heading back to L.A.
this afternoon.

1:31:55.750 --> 1:32:00.542
Well, it was nice
to see you again.

1:32:04.875 --> 1:32:05.917
I told Katherine everything.

1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.625
She knows
who you are.

1:32:11.333 --> 1:32:15.166
I wish you hadn't done that.

1:32:15.250 --> 1:32:16.834
I didn't do it for you.

1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:25.667
This belongs to you.

1:32:28.750 --> 1:32:31.875
I think my father would want you
to have it.

1:32:31.959 --> 1:32:35.542
They look very happy
together, don't they?

1:32:37.417 --> 1:32:38.792
I remember that.

1:32:38.875 --> 1:32:42.250
Do you?

1:33:03.625 --> 1:33:05.792
You pulled through
for us again, Terry.

1:33:05.875 --> 1:33:09.834
Percy is in love
with the deal.

1:33:09.917 --> 1:33:10.834
Ecstatic.

1:33:10.959 --> 1:33:13.834
Well, that's good.
I'm glad.

1:33:13.917 --> 1:33:17.000
That's a big boost for you
up the partnership ladder.

1:33:17.083 --> 1:33:19.250
Terrific.

1:33:19.333 --> 1:33:20.125
I hate it.

1:33:20.458 --> 1:33:23.041
It is the worst contract
I've ever seen.

1:33:23.125 --> 1:33:25.291
I told you five times
a separate trailer for my gym.

1:33:25.375 --> 1:33:28.250
I want to see
an acceptable contract by noon.

1:33:28.333 --> 1:33:30.333
I'm not being rude.
This is just how I feel.

1:33:30.417 --> 1:33:31.417
Well, Terry.

1:33:31.500 --> 1:33:33.458
I'm sure
you can handle it.

1:33:33.542 --> 1:33:35.208
I'll talk to you later.

1:33:35.291 --> 1:33:37.917
And don't forget lunch
with Switzer, huh?

1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:13.291
( knocking )

1:34:19.375 --> 1:34:22.000
This could be a big problem.

1:34:22.083 --> 1:34:25.250
We could lose the client. Mary?

1:34:28.709 --> 1:34:29.792
Robbins?

1:34:31.959 --> 1:34:33.458
I don't know, Bill.

1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:37.000
Terry, what do you think?

1:34:40.417 --> 1:34:42.792
I think...

1:34:44.875 --> 1:34:46.792
Terry?

1:34:46.875 --> 1:34:48.333
Terry?

1:34:51.667 --> 1:34:54.041
It's story time at my house.

1:34:55.208 --> 1:34:56.875
TERRY:
Hello.

1:34:56.959 --> 1:35:00.250
Merry Christmas, Terry.

1:35:00.333 --> 1:35:02.625
Katherine?

1:35:02.709 --> 1:35:04.166
I woke you. I'm sorry.

1:35:04.250 --> 1:35:07.583
I didn't even think
about the time difference.

1:35:07.667 --> 1:35:11.250
No, I was awake.

1:35:11.333 --> 1:35:15.542
I wanted you to know...
we're all here.

1:35:15.625 --> 1:35:18.291
My father. All of us.

1:35:18.375 --> 1:35:21.834
I was hoping for that.

1:35:21.959 --> 1:35:26.291
Well, thank you.
It's because of you.

1:35:26.375 --> 1:35:30.083
I'm so glad it worked out.

1:35:30.166 --> 1:35:35.583
Terry...

1:35:35.667 --> 1:35:37.667
I-I was wrong.

1:35:37.750 --> 1:35:40.291
I needed time to think.

1:35:40.375 --> 1:35:46.041
When you left,
I realized everything.

1:35:46.125 --> 1:35:48.875
I should never have let you go.

1:35:48.959 --> 1:35:51.750
Katherine, are you sure?

1:35:51.834 --> 1:35:55.750
I'm sure.

1:35:55.834 --> 1:35:59.667
I've fallen in love with you.

1:35:59.750 --> 1:36:03.750
I know
your life's out there now.

1:36:03.834 --> 1:36:04.834
I know.

1:36:04.917 --> 1:36:07.709
Not anymore.

1:36:07.792 --> 1:36:09.333
Turn around.

1:36:09.417 --> 1:36:10.709
What?

1:36:12.333 --> 1:36:15.208
Just turn around.

1:36:22.750 --> 1:36:24.083
