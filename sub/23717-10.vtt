WEBVTT

00:18.226 --> 00:21.604
- Jun, are you staying late tonight?
- Yes. Aren't you going home?

00:22.063 --> 00:24.774
I have something to do.
Carry on.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.401
Yes, sir.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.073
Jun, could you come over here
and help me with this?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.825
No, thanks.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.369
I'm not kidding.
Please, come and help me.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.873
I'm fine. I ate a lot for dinner.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.143
Really? Oh my God!

01:00.268 --> 01:03.438
He thought that I refused to help
and bragged about eating a lot.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.983
He completely misunderstood me.
What do I do?

01:07.108 --> 01:08.151
How about this?

01:13.656 --> 01:14.908
Oh, that's great.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.035
I'll certainly do that on Sunday.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.369
MR. YUM

01:20.330 --> 01:23.166
Hello, boss. Yeah, yeah?

01:23.291 --> 01:24.626
Okay. I will.

01:27.003 --> 01:30.131
I'll do just as you said.
He asked me to come tomorrow.

01:30.965 --> 01:34.093
Tomorrow? Tomorrow is...

01:34.803 --> 01:37.722
SUNDAY

01:40.099 --> 01:43.812
I'm working overtime on Sunday,
alone with my boss.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.022
A good opportunity.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.450
- Here's coffee, boss.
- Thanks.

02:00.703 --> 02:04.082
- This tastes good.
- Thanks.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.584
Then, ask him
some personal questions,

02:06.709 --> 02:09.796
about his family.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.091
- Boss?
- Yeah?

02:13.216 --> 02:16.094
Your daughter is in high school, right?

02:16.219 --> 02:19.430
And laugh
no matter how boring his story is.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.432
She failed the entrance exam,
and is preparing to take it next year.

02:21.724 --> 02:24.352
LAUGH, EVEN WHEN YOUR BOSS
TELLS YOU A BORING STORY

02:26.354 --> 02:30.108
No matter how lame it is,
laugh loudly!

02:30.233 --> 02:33.194
Because of that,
my wife's depression is getting worse.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.547
Sorry to leave you home alone.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.466
It's okay.
Enjoy your wedding anniversary.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.468
Anniversary?

03:00.305 --> 03:02.891
Today is a really special day.
I've been looking forward to it.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.019
I've planned everything for you.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.229
See you later, son.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.529
Have fun!

03:20.950 --> 03:22.285
Thanks.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.496
How about palm or face reading?

03:25.622 --> 03:26.789
Everyone loves those things.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.541
I don't know how.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.460
You can tell him anything.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.922
His "eyes are blah-blah,
nose is this, and mouth is that."

03:34.047 --> 03:36.382
Just say something good at the end.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.760
SAY NICE THINGS WHEN TELLING
YOUR BOSS' FORTUNE

03:38.885 --> 03:41.930
Can I tell your fortune?

03:42.055 --> 03:44.140
Oh, do you know how to do that?

03:44.265 --> 03:47.060
- Okay, why not?
- Yeah.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.732
You have slanted eyes,
a flat nose and a big face.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.777
You'll need lots of moisturizer,
so you'll have good luck with money.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.866
You're bald and your bald spot is shiny.
You'll live a long life.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.036
And--

04:08.998 --> 04:12.502
And when you eat together,
eat what your boss is eating.

04:13.253 --> 04:20.176
EAT THE SAME FOOD
YOUR BOSS IS EATING

04:22.887 --> 04:23.930
Do you like kimchi chigae?

04:24.055 --> 04:25.139
I love it.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.183
Why didn't you order one?

04:27.308 --> 04:30.520
I want to eat what you're eating.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.654
Can I have one more bowl of rice?

04:42.991 --> 04:45.827
You said you planned for everything.
What kind of place is this?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.453
Don't you remember?

04:47.578 --> 04:49.914
We came here when we started dating.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.042
I wanted to come here again today,
so I made a reservation in advance.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.086
We wrote something on the wall.
Remember?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.839
"Cheol-wang loves Jeong-kwon."

04:57.964 --> 05:01.009
"Cheol-wang loves Jeong-kwon."
"Cheol-wang loves Jeong..."

05:01.134 --> 05:02.677
"Cheol-wang loves--"

05:02.802 --> 05:03.761
CHEOL-WANG LOVES GYEONG-JA

05:04.304 --> 05:05.930
SHE IS JEONG-KWON KWON

05:14.439 --> 05:16.566
You must've been
madly in love with that lady.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.987
Honey, honey, wait.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.238
Oh, shit.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.531
Honey, wait!

05:26.492 --> 05:27.785
Here it is.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.834
What a sloppy job you've done!

05:34.959 --> 05:36.961
You're a new hire,
but you're not doing your best.

05:37.086 --> 05:40.048
If you go on like this,
you can't continue to work here.

05:40.923 --> 05:41.799
Should I be my own boss, then?

05:45.136 --> 05:46.262
Hello, America?

05:46.387 --> 05:48.139
Good morning, sir!

05:48.598 --> 05:51.684
Hi! Yes, I can hear you clearly.
The signal is excellent.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.103
PRESIDENT JUN CHO

06:03.362 --> 06:05.198
- Hey!
- What?

06:05.323 --> 06:08.659
How can you laugh now?
Do you think I'm funny?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.036
I'm sorry.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.333
Were you born with a silver spoon
in your mouth?

06:15.708 --> 06:17.460
Was I wrong?

06:18.544 --> 06:21.297
Honey, let's go eat something nice.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.508
There's a great steakhouse around here.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.967
Oh, have you been there, too?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.095
She must've loved steaks, huh?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.013
No, she loved Korean food.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.478
Honey, let's go to the lake.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.273
You've been saying
you want to see some water.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.528
- The lake?
- Yes.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.197
Let's go, let's go.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.825
Let's go, let's go.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.676
Oh, shit!
I may get fired today.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.594
Oh, right!

07:08.719 --> 07:10.847
Mr. Kim has vitamins.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.807
Those might help me wake up.

07:15.893 --> 07:16.727
The one with a yellow cap.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.236
ULTRA FAST SLEEPING PILLS
FAST-ASLEEP

07:31.242 --> 07:32.869
Okay, good.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.427
I'm sorry.

07:50.428 --> 07:54.265
Oh, I need to go to the restroom.

07:56.225 --> 08:01.272
The vitamins are not working.
I'm so sleepy.

08:04.442 --> 08:08.571
30 minutes should be enough.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.419
Oh, well. Ugh...

08:30.843 --> 08:33.054
What the hell? It's too dark.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.515
To be solitary and lonely
is romantic.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.059
It's nice here. Oh, there's a boat.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.727
Honey, let's get in the boat.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.021
- At night?
- Come on.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.231
Hello. Hi, there.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.776
- Can we get in the boat?
- No, it's too late.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.362
Say, what is this here?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.367
Okay, but don't go too far.
It can be dangerous.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.744
Okay, thank you.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.745
Honey, come on.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.957
Let's go boating like we're in a movie.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.793
- It's too dark.
- Come on.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.504
Wow...

09:08.965 --> 09:10.132
Wow, it's beautiful here.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.556
Have we gone too far?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.725
You're right, it's too dark.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.937
Wait, where is my phone?

09:23.062 --> 09:24.480
- Oh.
- No!

09:24.605 --> 09:26.691
You dropped it!

09:27.650 --> 09:29.235
Oh, no! You're driving me nuts!

09:29.360 --> 09:30.403
Go find it!

09:31.153 --> 09:32.822
We may die here!

09:32.947 --> 09:35.241
- Is that my fault?
- So it's mine?

09:35.366 --> 09:37.535
You got mad.
I was trying to make you feel better!

09:37.660 --> 09:38.744
So, is that my fault?

09:38.869 --> 09:43.082
- You're accountable, too.
- Oh, you have some nerve!

09:43.207 --> 09:45.251
Why am I responsible for everything?

09:45.376 --> 09:46.794
To hell with the anniversary!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.714
I'll never do anything for it again.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.048
Have you done anything so far?

09:51.173 --> 09:54.677
- Why don't you go meet Gyeong-ja?
- What? How could you say that?

09:54.802 --> 09:56.387
How can you not see
that you're to blame?

09:56.512 --> 09:57.513
I am not!

09:57.638 --> 09:59.807
- What have you done--!
- You--!

10:08.482 --> 10:14.071
PHASE 2

10:23.873 --> 10:27.335
There's no signal.
The kids may be worried.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.919
Yeah.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.302
I love kimchi chigae.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.179
All right, I have an idea.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.014
I don't think you rowed that far.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.893
One of us can swim ashore,
and ask for help.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.897
- It could be dangerous.
- No, it's possible.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.690
Huh?

10:49.815 --> 10:53.069
Okay then, you should go.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.239
No, you should go.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.825
I'm fine here. You should go.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.911
No, you should go.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.163
- Go now.
- You go now!

11:04.288 --> 11:05.623
You go, right now!

11:06.082 --> 11:09.251
- Go now.
- Honey, don't be sexist.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.003
Oh, no, don't!

11:11.128 --> 11:13.839
- Stop!
- Ugh!

11:16.467 --> 11:18.803
Honey, honey!

11:19.428 --> 11:22.890
- Honey!
- You pushed me!

11:23.015 --> 11:25.684
That does it.
I'll make your heart skip a beat.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.062
Oh, honey, help me!

11:30.356 --> 11:34.318
Honey, grab something!
Right there, grab anything!

11:36.153 --> 11:37.655
Grab anything you see!

11:38.155 --> 11:41.409
Grab anything around you!

11:46.539 --> 11:47.373
Where are you?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.834
You! What the--

11:51.419 --> 11:52.711
You!

12:00.845 --> 12:02.972
MONDAY

12:03.347 --> 12:05.516
Hi, good morning.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.810
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.647
Huh? Is Jun not here yet?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.400
He's so--

12:14.525 --> 12:17.862
Oh, well.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.034
Wow, it's been exactly 30 minutes.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.122
I feel great.
How can I be so on time?

12:28.664 --> 12:31.625
It was just a few minutes,
but I feel great!

12:31.750 --> 12:34.086
Those vitamins are working.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.592
Hello?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.511
Where are you?
When are you coming?

12:42.636 --> 12:45.222
I'm in the restroom.
I have diarrhea.

12:45.556 --> 12:50.311
Have you been in the restroom
all this time?

12:50.436 --> 12:53.439
When I have diarrhea,
it sometimes takes even longer.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.549
Why is everyone here on Sunday?

13:20.674 --> 13:23.886
Thank you for helping.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.596
Thank you.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.478
Ready to work now?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.231
I'm speechless.

13:37.233 --> 13:41.779
ON HIATUS

13:45.950 --> 13:49.245
I didn't know she was like this
before I married her.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.914
Same here.

13:52.039 --> 13:56.293
So you're certain
about getting a divorce?

13:56.418 --> 13:58.337
Is there any chance you'd reconsider?

13:58.462 --> 14:00.172
Not really.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.926
Once, you would've been willing

14:04.051 --> 14:05.594
to sacrifice yourself for each other.

14:05.719 --> 14:09.723
Yes, she can sacrifice herself for me.

14:09.848 --> 14:13.435
I think you're being selfish.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.146
Think what you like.
I've done nothing wrong.

14:16.272 --> 14:22.611
I don't want to make a wrong decision.
I think you should get a divorce.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.280
- What?
- What?

14:25.489 --> 14:29.535
Well, I didn't really mean to--

14:29.660 --> 14:32.913
Aren't you supposed to advise us
to not get a divorce?

14:33.038 --> 14:35.499
I think you should get a divorce.

14:35.624 --> 14:38.419
Aren't you supposed to say
"I'll see you in four weeks"?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.212
That's what you should say.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.089
I think you should get a divorce.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.301
- Well...
- Well, I mean--

14:45.426 --> 14:47.678
please, stop repeating yourself.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.180
I think you should get a divorce.

14:50.306 --> 14:54.101
- Oh, aren't you hungry?
- Yes, I am.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.812
- I bought an eel for you.
- I love you, honey.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.358
I think you should get a divorce.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.076
Man, this is killing me.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.661
What's wrong?

15:14.496 --> 15:16.582
I can't go on like this.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.084
It's too tough to work.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.045
What did you think?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.005
Drawing cartoons was easy?

15:23.130 --> 15:25.299
I have to keep producing ideas.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.509
I haven't gone anywhere
for the whole year.

15:28.719 --> 15:29.803
I'm too tired.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.598
Why don't you skip a week?

15:32.723 --> 15:34.016
Skip a week?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.185
Can I do that?

15:36.310 --> 15:38.812
Sure.
How can we keep working every day?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.899
We're not machines.
Take a week off.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.151
No one would say anything.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.695
Son, are you kidding?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.364
How can you take time off
whenever you like?

15:48.489 --> 15:51.492
However small it is, it's your job, man.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.744
Are you bored with your work already?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.497
- How pathetic!
- You have no patience.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.208
I thought I'd take time off,
and go on a trip or something.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.710
I recently got a pay raise.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.088
We've never been overseas.

16:04.713 --> 16:05.798
- Overseas?
- Overseas?

16:05.923 --> 16:07.758
Yeah.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.886
- Mom, congratulations!
- Well--

16:11.011 --> 16:13.722
Yes, let's celebrate.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.265
No, you can't!

16:15.391 --> 16:18.102
You're just getting to be popular.
How can you take time off?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.814
The others have taken time off.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.942
But you're still a newbie.

16:25.067 --> 16:25.943
No, you can't.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.238
He said no. That was a bad idea.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.323
What? We already paid for the tour.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.201
- Three nights, four days, Southeast Asia.
- Already? With my credit card?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.370
You said you'd pay for it.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.455
No, cancel it. I can't go!

16:38.580 --> 16:40.457
This is non-refundable.
It's a special sale.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.292
We'll go without you.
We have no choice.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.128
What are you talking about?
I'm the one who needs a vacation.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.088
No one is going if I can't.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.089
What do we do now?

16:47.214 --> 16:49.925
It's nonrefundable,
but we can't go without you.

16:50.050 --> 16:50.926
I have an idea!

16:51.051 --> 16:53.846
Seok, will you come with us
if you can get a week off?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.681
Sure.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.725
- But he said no--
- Then make him say yes.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.144
By all means necessary.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.520
What?

17:02.021 --> 17:06.442
NO CARTOONS TODAY

17:09.820 --> 17:11.864
Isn't it simple?

17:14.074 --> 17:16.285
You can't draw cartoons,
if you can't use your hand.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.872
- Get a hammer.
- Yes, sir.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.374
No! What are you talking about?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.586
Right. That's a bad idea.

17:25.711 --> 17:29.840
Just pretend you can't use your hand.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.468
- Hmm...
- Ah...!

17:37.681 --> 17:41.602
"I've hurt my wrist.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.272
I have no choice but to take a week off."

17:45.397 --> 17:47.399
Right. Good!

17:49.109 --> 17:50.027
He texted me!

17:50.152 --> 17:53.322
You're ambidextrous. Use your left hand.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.990
What is he talking about?

17:55.115 --> 17:56.575
Since when have you been ambidextrous?

17:56.700 --> 18:00.120
You know nothing about your son.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.332
No, we need a more sophisticated approach!

18:03.457 --> 18:07.211
Let's write bad comments on your cartoon.
That will stir up some controversy.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.256
Then, the viewers will begin to argue.

18:11.381 --> 18:16.595
Then... he'd have to say yes.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.306
There's no controversial
issues in my cartoons.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.101
There could be some, if we look for them.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.436
Let's see.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.438
Here!

18:26.563 --> 18:27.481
JUST MEMORIZE IT.
I CAN DO THAT.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.440
What about it?

18:28.565 --> 18:29.900
He's just walking.

18:30.734 --> 18:33.112
Listen to the viewers.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.824
Koreans are the most sensitive
about politics!

18:38.742 --> 18:44.998
"The color of his clothes represents
a certain political party.

18:45.124 --> 18:49.169
You're injecting your political beliefs.

18:49.294 --> 18:53.507
I'm so disappointed in you."

18:54.925 --> 18:57.136
- Huh?
- Wow!

18:58.554 --> 19:01.056
You're smart.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.143
That will be enough to stir up
some controversy.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.436
You will be severely criticized.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.729
Let's see.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.984
"What did he say?
Did elementary school vacation begin?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.610
He's so stupid.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.530
Seok, just ignore it.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.868
He must be really ugly."

19:20.993 --> 19:23.495
Hey, you don't know what I look like.

19:23.620 --> 19:27.457
How dare you criticize my looks?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.334
It's not working.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.296
No, we can't give up.

19:39.178 --> 19:43.140
You should be mean to your fans.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.560
Then they'll criticize you.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.312
- Would they?
- Sure!

19:49.646 --> 19:50.564
Let's go.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.109
Hi. Are you the webtoon artist,

19:54.234 --> 19:56.945
- Seok Cho?
- Yes, I am.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.032
Could you give me your signature?
I'm your fan.

20:00.157 --> 20:03.035
- Thank you.
- Be mean.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.495
Be mean.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.540
I have no time.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.627
Meaner.

20:13.003 --> 20:18.592
My signature? Don't ask me.
I have no time for that.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.521
Oh, he's Seok Cho. Hello!

20:31.647 --> 20:33.857
Mom, that's Seok Cho.

20:41.031 --> 20:45.202
I want to be a cartoonist like you.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.626
No, you shouldn't.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.378
But that's my dream.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.338
No. You have no talent.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.215
Absolutely none!

21:03.679 --> 21:06.723
Seok, what have you been doing today?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.561
Everyone's talking about you online.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.563
The people who saw you
keep posting something.

21:13.689 --> 21:17.025
In that case,
I'd better take some time off.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.696
No way! They all love you!

21:22.447 --> 21:23.532
What?

21:29.121 --> 21:34.167
I thought he'd be funny,
but actually, he's so cool.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.255
Seok Cho, a heartbreaker.

21:40.632 --> 21:44.678
He even gave my son realistic advice.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.555
Thank you.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.683
This is not working, either.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.103
Do you have to get approval from him?

21:53.228 --> 21:54.479
What if you just take time off?

21:54.604 --> 21:56.273
What can he do?

22:11.705 --> 22:15.292
I'm taking a week off!
I'm not changing my mind!

22:17.252 --> 22:21.214
Okay, whatever.
Why are you yelling at me?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.927
Do what you want.

22:31.892 --> 22:36.313
Thanks to my son, I'm traveling abroad.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.317
Is it too late to go without this man?

22:40.442 --> 22:41.610
Okay!

22:42.944 --> 22:46.698
How could you pick this lame sweater
for the trip?

22:46.823 --> 22:51.203
Well, this is even worse.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.168
Ae-bong, is this your report?

22:58.293 --> 22:59.753
Is there a problem?

22:59.878 --> 23:04.007
Yes, there is.
This is unsatisfactory.

23:04.132 --> 23:08.261
My boss is going to check this.
He'd ruin me for this!

23:09.971 --> 23:12.265
I'm sorry. I'll revise it.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.769
So sloppy.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.861
- Aren't you going for lunch?
- You go ahead.

23:24.986 --> 23:25.987
Okay.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.334
It's Ae-bong. Take this.

23:42.087 --> 23:45.465
- Hi, Ae-bong!
- Hi, are you at the airport?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.008
Yes, I'm checking in soon.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.760
Your voice sounds strange.
Are you okay?

23:49.219 --> 23:51.429
Yes, I am.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.308
I just want to see your cartoons.
I'm waiting for them.

23:55.433 --> 24:00.230
Huh? There are no cartoons today.

24:00.355 --> 24:01.481
I'm taking a week off.

24:01.606 --> 24:05.777
I thought you'd already done some
before you left.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.864
Your cartoons are my only pleasure.

24:09.990 --> 24:13.785
Really? Do you like them so much?

24:14.786 --> 24:17.038
Have fun, anyway. I have to go.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.838
Hi.

24:26.464 --> 24:27.716
$26, please.

24:27.841 --> 24:31.845
Oh, it's you.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.430
Hey, it's been a long time!

24:33.555 --> 24:35.307
Oh, hi! How nice to see you here.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.309
I love your webtoon.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.935
You're the best among the classmen.

24:39.352 --> 24:43.148
- Right, not too bad.
- Well--

24:49.279 --> 24:50.864
I envy you.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.908
I haven't made my debut yet.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.993
It's not all that great.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.786
You don't know the ropes yet.
It's so tough.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.165
However tough it is,
that's all I want.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.250
You don't know anything yet.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.253
You have to argue with the company.
Your ideas run dry.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.172
It's killing me.
You should do something else.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.258
That's why I'm taking a break,
and going on a trip.

25:10.383 --> 25:11.343
Here.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.970
- Well, good luck to you!
- Okay, bye.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.309
What? Taking a break?

25:19.434 --> 25:23.813
You're so full of yourself!
You have no respect for the viewers.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.861
You have no respect for the viewers.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.199
- Who are you?
- It's me, Seok Cho.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.534
Right, Seok Cho.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.870
I love your webtoon. You're great!

25:38.995 --> 25:41.873
You're the first one of us to make it.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.667
No, it's nothing.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.752
Don't be so modest.

25:45.877 --> 25:49.005
All I want to do is to draw what I want.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.049
You don't understand things yet.

25:51.174 --> 25:54.302
After a year or so, your ideas run dry.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.224
That's why I'm taking a break,
and going on a trip.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.977
Well, good luck to you.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.770
Keep the change.

26:08.358 --> 26:12.737
You're so full of yourself!
You have no respect for the viewers.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.407
You're complaining like that
after only one year.

26:15.532 --> 26:18.159
Why don't you give me the job
if you hate it that much?

26:18.285 --> 26:21.121
See what happens when I become famous.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.631
Seok, what are you doing?
Come on, we'll be late.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.050
Hurry up, I have your passport here.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.136
Come on!

26:37.387 --> 26:39.931
- Aren't you going home?
- I have an e-mail from Seok Cho.

26:40.056 --> 26:43.310
I need to read it before I go.
You go ahead.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.270
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.524
NO CARTOONS TODAY

26:49.649 --> 26:53.361
So, you're taking a break, huh?

26:56.364 --> 26:57.490
I WISH...

26:57.615 --> 26:59.117
What?

27:02.912 --> 27:03.997
I'M STAYING IN ALL DAY LONG.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.105
My dream was simple.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.400
To show people my cartoons.

27:33.193 --> 27:36.863
But when the dream came true,
it became my job.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.823
I've been doing that job every day.

27:38.948 --> 27:43.578
And I forgot that I was living the dream.

27:47.457 --> 27:52.462
And my family helped me
to make my dream come true.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.842
I could draw my cartoon,
thanks to them.

27:58.551 --> 28:03.056
I always want to be with them--
well, as long as they give me inspiration.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.101
It's hot.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.646
- Welcome home.
- Hi, Seok.

28:09.771 --> 28:13.358
- I said to go on the elephant ride.
-  Sawadikap!

28:15.193 --> 28:17.737
Did you finish your cartoon?

28:17.862 --> 28:21.616
- Hmm?
- Did you finish your cartoon?

28:22.367 --> 28:27.997
No, I haven't.
I have so much more to do.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.709
I kept on working.

28:32.710 --> 28:38.425
For a year, two years, three years.

28:38.550 --> 28:43.221
Meanwhile, my number-one fan
has always laughed loud next to me.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.642
CHO'S TERRITORY

28:50.520 --> 28:51.896
She always laughed.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.567
So hilarious!

28:56.693 --> 29:01.656
After some time had passed, I realized
she didn't laugh because of my cartoons.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.791
Everything just made her laugh.

29:11.916 --> 29:15.378
I loved seeing her laugh.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.840
Meanwhile, I always tried not to forget

29:18.965 --> 29:20.633
that I was an ordinary boy.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.553
No, I was less than ordinary.

29:23.678 --> 29:28.641
It was the cartoons
that made me special.

29:29.184 --> 29:34.647
So, I've been drawing
The Sound of Your Heart  ever since.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.274
That's impressive.

29:36.399 --> 29:40.069
But where is your family now?

29:45.867 --> 29:48.536
Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.092
- Be quiet!
- They're filming something.

30:03.218 --> 30:09.599
You're too old to wear those
blue pants and that blue shirt.

30:10.850 --> 30:17.232
Ae-bong, you're old now.
Be careful when you laugh.

30:29.619 --> 30:32.789
All of them have lived long lives,
probably because they got mean remarks.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.457
From the online haters?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.961
No, from ourselves.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.925
Anyway, how long
will you continue to draw

30:44.050 --> 30:46.803
The Sound of Your Heart?

30:47.846 --> 30:51.516
Oh, that.
