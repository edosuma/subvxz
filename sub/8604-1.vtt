Man: Docking hatch

01:38.808 --> 01:41.122
M.R.D. removed
from containment.

01:41.198 --> 01:42.649
Preparing to load.

01:42.714 --> 01:46.326
Hold full exposure duration
at no more than 10 seconds.

01:46.495 --> 01:48.629

01:55.446 --> 01:56.747

01:58.694 --> 02:01.192

02:01.397 --> 02:02.759
<i>Close hatch.</i>

02:02.813 --> 02:06.199
<i>Turn handle left 45 degrees.</i>

<i>Lock it at high noon

- (buzzing)

02:17.149 --> 02:19.538
(alarm blaring)

02:19.627 --> 02:22.296
Left 45, then right.

02:22.407 --> 02:24.929
Left... right.

02:25.028 --> 02:27.567
You just caused
a thermonuclear explosion,

02:27.648 --> 02:29.150
wiped out the whole city.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.504
Sorry, Jim.

02:31.858 --> 02:33.755
I promise I'll get it right
on the day.

02:33.790 --> 02:35.530
This is the day, Matty.

02:35.615 --> 02:38.027
- (sighs)
- You want us to switch?

02:38.142 --> 02:39.758
No, there's no time for him
to learn the meters.

02:39.831 --> 02:41.766
I'll never understand how
you're able to solve

02:41.801 --> 02:43.647
the most complex
mathematical equations,

02:43.736 --> 02:46.071
but you can't tell
left from right.

02:46.108 --> 02:47.839
It's a form of dyscalculia.

02:47.933 --> 02:50.250
The parietal lobes of
my cerebral cortex...

02:50.344 --> 02:52.534
Jim: Okay.
We have time for one more

02:52.569 --> 02:54.363
practice run at this.
Reset everything.

02:54.420 --> 02:57.552
We've been at this
for 72 hours straight.

02:57.626 --> 02:59.367
Only two more
till we go live.

02:59.442 --> 03:00.880
I'll get you
some more coffee.

03:01.004 --> 03:03.665
(sighs) Coffee, amphetamines,
more coffee.

03:03.742 --> 03:05.777
You're gonna kill yourself.

03:05.825 --> 03:08.659
We are precious moments from
a topological anomaly.

03:08.694 --> 03:10.828
Is that what I should tell
everyone at your funeral?

03:10.898 --> 03:12.014
No.

03:12.195 --> 03:14.498
You signed
a confidentiality agreement.

03:16.924 --> 03:19.861
(whirring)

03:22.696 --> 03:24.461
Jim Beale, project log.

03:24.563 --> 03:26.328
Part one of the experiment.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.249
Tentative results.

03:28.412 --> 03:31.733
Opening a traversable wormhole
in the space-time continuum,

03:31.822 --> 03:33.524
first ever recorded.

03:36.373 --> 03:38.427
This tear that I will create
in the fabric of the universe

03:38.511 --> 03:40.504
is powered by M.R.D.

03:41.493 --> 03:44.778
Extremely volatile,
radioactive substance,

03:44.851 --> 03:47.600
so, of course,
all precautions will be taken.

03:47.681 --> 03:52.719
Possible dangers range from
manageable radiation leak to...

03:52.922 --> 03:56.573
Well, the universe
collapsing onto itself.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.478
It's now 47 minutes
until we initiate

03:58.513 --> 04:00.382
the first part
of the sequence...

04:00.437 --> 04:02.690
opening one end of
the wormhole.

04:03.705 --> 04:05.673
Okay.
He should be here.

04:05.802 --> 04:08.103
I'm gonna give him
the Big Bang speech.

04:08.193 --> 04:10.811
Oh, Jim, give him the fireworks.
That's what he's here for.

04:10.904 --> 04:12.928
Now, once opened,
we should detect

04:13.004 --> 04:15.940
a unique sequence of particles
sent through from

04:15.999 --> 04:18.555
the other side,
a sequence so unique

04:18.601 --> 04:21.906
that we will know that we
sent them to ourselves.

04:26.021 --> 04:27.232
<i>And I will have
proof of the findings</i>

04:27.267 --> 04:30.437
<i>to show our venture capitalist,
Klaus Meisner.</i>

04:32.295 --> 04:34.275
<i>And he will then provide
the necessary M.R.D.</i>

04:34.380 --> 04:36.748
<i>for us to open
the other end.</i>

04:36.816 --> 04:38.571
Let's see
what I'm paying for.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.743
Then we will send this unique
sequence of particles

04:40.801 --> 04:43.206
back through to ourselves,

04:43.399 --> 04:46.035
thereby proving that the project
is a success.

04:51.896 --> 04:54.063
The Big Bang.
We have proven theories...

04:54.150 --> 04:57.120
This isn't my ideal situation.

04:57.162 --> 04:58.014
To have an investor

04:58.087 --> 05:01.235
be this kind of major factor
in an experiment.

05:01.416 --> 05:04.494
But I only have enough M.R.D.
to open one end.

05:04.621 --> 05:06.600
We are about to embark
on a journey

05:06.666 --> 05:10.170
- that's going to take...
- Enough of the physics lesson.

05:10.298 --> 05:11.748
Get on with the light show.

05:11.829 --> 05:14.816
This whole thing is
an experiment in certainty.

05:18.204 --> 05:20.173
I'm certain it will work.

05:25.791 --> 05:28.193
(beeping)

05:31.510 --> 05:34.646
Jim: Balance metric pressure
at 057.

05:34.829 --> 05:37.713
Matty: Metric pressure
sustaining 057.

05:37.810 --> 05:39.471
Releasing valves.

05:41.378 --> 05:43.661
Docking hatch open and clear.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.979
Jim: Prepare to load M.R.D.

05:52.624 --> 05:54.818
M.R.D. removed
from containment.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.199
Hold full exposure no longer
than 10 seconds.

05:59.380 --> 06:01.841
9, 8...

06:01.998 --> 06:04.591
7, 6...

06:04.723 --> 06:07.658
5, 4...

06:07.746 --> 06:10.747
3, 2...

06:10.847 --> 06:12.214
1.

06:13.971 --> 06:15.771
M.R.D. in place.

06:16.007 --> 06:18.007
Close hatch.

06:18.508 --> 06:23.279
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

06:27.584 --> 06:29.754
Lock it at high noon.

06:32.549 --> 06:34.418
Engage sequence.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.890
Here we go.

06:39.925 --> 06:43.095
(whirring)

06:45.997 --> 06:49.366
- (buzzing)
- (crackling)

07:44.320 --> 07:45.987
Man: <i>Jim.</i>

07:46.252 --> 07:46.797
Jim.

07:46.832 --> 07:49.935
(gasps and breathes heavily)

07:50.293 --> 07:52.329
We thought you were
having a seizure.

07:53.326 --> 07:54.455
Did it work?

07:54.490 --> 07:55.603
Kept you from
biting your tongue.

07:55.638 --> 07:58.601
- No, the machine.
- The magnetic core melted.

07:58.674 --> 08:01.238
- The regulator's blown.
- Where's Klaus?

08:01.304 --> 08:03.405
He left when
you were unconscious.

08:03.540 --> 08:06.407
You can only burn a candle
at both ends for so long.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.070
You should go home
and get some sleep.

08:08.147 --> 08:09.912
I sold my home
to pay you and Matty.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.082
(sighs)

08:12.172 --> 08:13.897
Maybe it was sabotage.

08:13.932 --> 08:16.108
- Right.
- No, I'm serious.

08:16.273 --> 08:18.166
Maybe it was visitors
from the future

08:18.229 --> 08:19.977
who came back
to destroy our project

08:20.012 --> 08:23.414
because it eventually leads to
some distant apocalypse.

08:23.665 --> 08:26.568
- It's a distinct possibility.
- (chuckles)

08:26.992 --> 08:28.727
Guys.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.859
Look what I found.

08:49.352 --> 08:51.787
It's an exotic hybrid
of the dahlia genus.

08:52.884 --> 08:54.756
There.
Right there.

08:54.837 --> 08:57.081
That black speck.

08:57.339 --> 08:58.784
Could be a missing pixel.

08:58.819 --> 09:02.255
- It's moving.
- Yeah. There it goes.

09:02.431 --> 09:04.364
Jim: There.

09:04.416 --> 09:06.908
- I think that was Matty.
- No, no, I saw someone.

09:06.943 --> 09:08.844
I saw it before
I blacked out.

09:08.957 --> 09:11.483
It looked like a person.
Not Matty.

09:14.777 --> 09:16.512
It went out the front.

09:21.754 --> 09:23.756
(alarm blares)

09:42.200 --> 09:43.803
Where did you
just come from?

09:45.162 --> 09:47.493
I should be asking you.
How did you do that?

09:47.558 --> 09:49.426
- What?
- That.

09:49.461 --> 09:50.645
How did you get here?

09:50.679 --> 09:52.766
In a car.
How did you get here?

09:52.868 --> 09:54.364
You didn't just walk
through a wormhole?

09:54.399 --> 09:57.328
You're making me
feel like I did.

09:57.418 --> 09:59.137
I just met you.

09:59.230 --> 10:01.930
Then why are you acting
like you know me?

10:04.045 --> 10:05.413
I don't.

10:21.919 --> 10:25.289
- (knock on window)
- You left before you could see.

10:25.495 --> 10:26.935
It was a success.

10:27.117 --> 10:29.017
Didn't appear that way to me,
Mr. Beale.

10:29.074 --> 10:30.451
If you just come back
into the lab.

10:30.537 --> 10:34.150
You've wasted my money.
Now you're wasting my time.

10:34.229 --> 10:36.114
I can prove to you
that it worked.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.635
But I'm already late
for a previous engagement.

10:38.693 --> 10:39.936
We made history tonight.

10:39.971 --> 10:41.345
I'm sure whoever it is
will understand.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.098
"Whoever it is" is my wife.

10:43.266 --> 10:44.440
She's already
at the restaurant,

10:44.475 --> 10:49.150
and I assure you,
she will not understand.

10:52.127 --> 10:54.494
Why don't you and
your little friend join us

10:54.529 --> 10:56.663
and we can
discuss this over dinner?

10:56.755 --> 10:58.240
We just met.

10:58.489 --> 11:00.979
- Another time, then.
- No. no, no, no.

11:01.287 --> 11:02.776
We would love to join you
and your wife for dinner,

11:02.873 --> 11:04.242
- wouldn't we?
- Abby.

11:04.277 --> 11:06.645
- Abby.
- Abby.

11:09.242 --> 11:10.081
What's going on, Jim?

11:10.167 --> 11:12.223
Start running preliminary tests
on the flower.

11:12.258 --> 11:15.359
I'm gonna go to dinner
with the Meisners and Abby.

11:15.489 --> 11:16.690
Okay.

11:16.733 --> 11:18.567
(car door closes)

11:18.687 --> 11:20.356
Who's Abby?

11:54.719 --> 11:56.366
Jim: What we've done
is folded

11:56.463 --> 11:58.907
on top of itself
by forming a tunnel,

11:58.942 --> 12:01.286
a shortcut between
one location in space-time

12:01.383 --> 12:03.138
to another light-years away.

12:03.248 --> 12:05.112
But in order to
traverse a wormhole,

12:05.147 --> 12:06.481
you have to have
two openings.

12:06.516 --> 12:09.333
What we did tonight
was open one end of it.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.069
Where's the other end?

12:11.221 --> 12:12.655
We have to do it again
to find out.

12:12.740 --> 12:14.790
I'm not sure I follow.

12:15.018 --> 12:16.546
The way it works is,

12:16.649 --> 12:18.826
you need a transmitter
and a receiver.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.991
Now, like a telephone...
I'm mixing metaphors here,

12:21.026 --> 12:22.283
but you can't
complete a call

12:22.318 --> 12:24.160
without another phone
involved.

12:24.195 --> 12:26.434
We already have
the receiver.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.846
We got the call.

12:29.653 --> 12:31.221
How much?

12:31.310 --> 12:32.876
It's not capital
I'm asking for.

12:32.974 --> 12:34.675
No, for the whole project.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.034
The research, the formulas,

12:36.069 --> 12:38.137
the machine, everything.
How much?

12:38.250 --> 12:39.515
It's not for sale.

12:39.549 --> 12:41.349
Then what do you want,
Mr. Beale?

12:41.383 --> 12:44.609
- Another unit of M.R.D.
- And for that I get what, 10%?

12:44.644 --> 12:46.670
We're talking about
dangerous radioisotopes,

12:46.740 --> 12:48.457
enriched uranium,
yellowcake,

12:48.491 --> 12:50.412
the sort of thing
countries go to war over.

12:50.467 --> 12:52.560
Not anymore, once we have
the ability

12:52.611 --> 12:54.771
to answer the fundamental
questions of the universe.

12:54.806 --> 12:58.307
But how will we make money
on our investment?

12:59.735 --> 13:00.583
With all due respect,

13:00.618 --> 13:04.604
we're not talking about
hover cars and x-ray goggles.

13:04.780 --> 13:07.396
We're talking about an epoch
of human evolution.

13:07.502 --> 13:09.844
Pardon my pedestrian
viewpoint, Mr. Beale,

13:09.933 --> 13:13.401
but how do you plan
to market that?

13:13.625 --> 13:16.544
Pardon my pedestrian viewpoint
for a moment, Ms. Meisner.

13:16.641 --> 13:19.177
Do you know who
pioneered electricity?

13:20.223 --> 13:21.778
Of course.

13:22.025 --> 13:23.792
Thomas Edison.

13:24.894 --> 13:26.661
I thought so, too.

13:26.734 --> 13:30.105
Until I stumbled upon a book
about Nikola Tesla.

13:32.791 --> 13:35.521
You see, Tesla was working
towards a way

13:35.556 --> 13:37.967
to get everyone
on the planet safe, free,

13:38.006 --> 13:41.104
limitless electricity,
and he would have,

13:41.166 --> 13:43.376
except Edison did everything
in his power

13:43.411 --> 13:46.049
to discredit him
and crush his reputation.

13:46.127 --> 13:47.516
Mm.

13:47.550 --> 13:49.866
Edison's company
developed a patent

13:49.901 --> 13:53.147
for an inefficient current
you had to pay for.

13:53.193 --> 13:55.108
Tesla wanted to
better the world.

13:55.143 --> 13:58.048
And Edison forced us all
to have a monthly power bill

13:58.083 --> 14:01.393
because he was envious
of a profound idea.

14:02.837 --> 14:05.407
Now, I don't have a horse
in this race,

14:05.442 --> 14:07.470
but I would put
my money on Jim,

14:07.567 --> 14:12.714
because he's Tesla,
and Edison was a dick.

14:22.214 --> 14:25.985
(car door opens and closes)

14:26.082 --> 14:28.717
I'll supply you
with the M.R.D.

14:28.752 --> 14:31.397
But I want to own
half the machine.

14:32.896 --> 14:34.262
Can't do that.

14:34.403 --> 14:36.120
Well, you see, my company

14:36.155 --> 14:38.529
is in the enviable position

14:38.564 --> 14:41.601
of being the sole
manufacturer of M.R.D.

14:42.844 --> 14:45.714
So, best of luck.

14:47.757 --> 14:49.891
Forty-nine percent.

14:50.183 --> 14:52.286
And money for the repairs.

14:57.342 --> 14:59.643
You have a week.

14:59.792 --> 15:02.076
I won't sleep
till it's complete.

15:11.316 --> 15:12.756
Thank you.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.437
Thank you.

15:32.761 --> 15:34.531
You want to share a cab?

15:49.055 --> 15:50.991
Jim: Was I playing
the beard tonight?

15:52.284 --> 15:55.577
(chuckles)
Why do you ask?

15:55.685 --> 15:57.636
Well, either you came
to the lab with Klaus

15:57.671 --> 15:59.908
or you got there
through the wormhole.

16:01.687 --> 16:04.453
I did arrive with Klaus.

16:05.054 --> 16:07.090
But I'm leaving with you.

16:11.118 --> 16:14.055
That kiss could've cost me
millions of dollars.

16:15.403 --> 16:17.606
Would it have been worth it?

16:20.953 --> 16:22.211
(chuckles)

16:22.350 --> 16:24.378
I'd have to do more research,

16:24.428 --> 16:25.705
eliminate the variables.

16:25.740 --> 16:27.477
Mm.

16:43.889 --> 16:45.591
This is me.

16:49.336 --> 16:50.775
You sure he won't mind?

16:50.810 --> 16:52.710
He went home...

16:52.758 --> 16:54.660
with his wife.

17:02.492 --> 17:03.760
(door closes)

17:04.481 --> 17:06.171
(keys jingle)

17:10.563 --> 17:12.465
Drinks?

17:13.986 --> 17:15.922
Black coffee for me.

17:27.731 --> 17:30.584
KMC 0-14.

17:30.721 --> 17:32.566
You like my dahlia?

17:32.626 --> 17:34.860
(cellphone ringing)

17:35.002 --> 17:37.138
Yeah.
Where did you get it?

17:40.148 --> 17:41.618
- (beep)
- (ringing stops)

17:50.314 --> 17:52.716
(cellphone ringing)

17:55.830 --> 17:58.900
Sorry.
I have to take this.

18:00.042 --> 18:01.009
(beep)

18:01.090 --> 18:02.429
Chuck, what do you got?

18:02.465 --> 18:03.999
<i>What are you doing?</i>

18:04.103 --> 18:05.638
Uh, talking to you.

18:05.774 --> 18:09.766
<i>What time do you have
exactly to the second?</i>

18:09.864 --> 18:12.594
9:45:22, 23.

18:12.675 --> 18:13.865
Come on, get on with it.

18:13.907 --> 18:15.658
<i>When did you and I
first meet?</i>

18:15.755 --> 18:17.580
- What is this?
- <i>Just tell me.</i>

18:17.615 --> 18:20.591
- <i>It's important.</i>
- Uh, 10 years ago

18:20.696 --> 18:22.255
at that karaoke bar
with the weird name.

18:22.290 --> 18:23.219
What's going on?

18:23.254 --> 18:25.472
<i>So, we've known each other
a long time.</i>

18:25.575 --> 18:27.433
- <i>We trust each other?</i>
- Yeah.

18:27.493 --> 18:30.003
<i>Stay away from that girl.
She's no good for you.</i>

18:30.038 --> 18:32.026
What?

18:32.119 --> 18:33.439
<i>Just don't tell her</i>

18:33.521 --> 18:36.224
<i>or anyone else
about the experiment.</i>

18:36.320 --> 18:39.553
<i>We're onto something
much bigger than we imagined.</i>

18:40.742 --> 18:42.177
(beep)

18:46.014 --> 18:47.315
(door opens)

18:47.349 --> 18:49.886
(door closes)

19:30.455 --> 19:32.626
- (beep)
- (door opens)

19:35.269 --> 19:36.669
What are you
doing here, Jim?

19:36.704 --> 19:39.053
I went to the lab.
You guys were gone.

19:39.225 --> 19:40.845
You should go back.
We'll meet you there.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.645
No, no, no, you called.
You said something...

19:42.680 --> 19:43.413
We were onto something.

19:43.448 --> 19:44.991
And what was this stuff
about Abby?

19:45.026 --> 19:46.795
(high-pitched screeching)

19:48.902 --> 19:50.270
(groans)

19:52.971 --> 19:55.608
My head is killing me.

19:55.813 --> 19:56.581
See?

19:56.687 --> 19:58.534
I told you you need to stop
popping those pills

19:58.615 --> 20:00.683
and get some sleep.

20:01.052 --> 20:01.763
What did you mean earlier

20:01.798 --> 20:03.390
when you were
talking about Abby?

20:03.425 --> 20:05.517
Let me get you some pills.

20:06.434 --> 20:07.411
Chuck.

20:07.464 --> 20:10.117
Chuck, I figured it out.
It makes sense.

20:10.152 --> 20:12.060
I finally see it now.

20:12.229 --> 20:14.631
Fucking intense.

20:14.736 --> 20:16.438
(high-pitched screeching)

20:16.602 --> 20:18.536
(Jim groaning)

20:18.604 --> 20:20.589
Matty, stop.
You're giving Jim a headache.

20:20.662 --> 20:22.180
This isn't a headache.
This is a lightning storm

20:22.215 --> 20:24.213
between my temples.
Just tell me,

20:24.263 --> 20:27.600
what did you mean earlier
when you were talking about...

21:08.491 --> 21:09.480
How long was I out?

21:09.515 --> 21:12.524
Huh?
Oh, Jim, you're awake.

21:12.559 --> 21:16.330
Um, you were unconscious for
approximately 8.5 hours.

21:16.365 --> 21:17.798
Why didn't you wake me?

21:17.832 --> 21:18.868
Your biological imperative

21:18.903 --> 21:21.075
requires a minimum amount
of dormancy per day

21:21.148 --> 21:23.951
in order to
properly function.

21:24.139 --> 21:25.592
But you should lie back down
in case of another...

21:25.627 --> 21:27.963
I just needed some sleep.
I got plenty.

21:28.210 --> 21:30.537
Where'd you get that jacket?

21:30.659 --> 21:32.118
Haven't you considered
the correlation

21:32.153 --> 21:35.516
between your episodes and
the arrival of KMC 0-14?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.183
KMC 0...

21:37.486 --> 21:39.488
The serial number
of the dahlia.

21:42.986 --> 21:46.369
We have to wait for Chuck
to get back.

21:46.537 --> 21:48.604
You and Chuck meet me
at the lab.

21:48.897 --> 21:51.234
We have another wormhole
to open.

21:53.238 --> 21:55.640
- We have to wait for Chuck.
- (door opens)

22:10.581 --> 22:13.383
(beep)

22:14.640 --> 22:16.409
(exclaims)

22:17.418 --> 22:19.161
Man: <i>Hey, did you forget
your keys?</i>

22:19.216 --> 22:21.200
Is this the residence
of Abby Ross?

22:21.235 --> 22:23.534
<i>She's not here.</i>

22:23.639 --> 22:25.748
This is Jim Beale.
I'm a friend of hers.

22:25.826 --> 22:28.596
Hey, sleepyhead,
looking for me?

22:29.571 --> 22:31.606
Is there a man
in your place?

22:36.021 --> 22:39.193
I guess you buzzed
my neighbor by accident.

22:39.297 --> 22:40.838
I need to see your flower.

22:40.947 --> 22:42.731
Wow, classy.

22:42.792 --> 22:44.794
I am a lady.

22:44.915 --> 22:48.025
You can at least buy me
breakfast first.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.789
(beep)

23:03.499 --> 23:06.160
Do they even
serve breakfast here?

23:06.246 --> 23:08.315
Two morning specials, Mike.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.909
Your dahlia,
where did you get it?

23:13.192 --> 23:15.228
It was a gift.

23:17.502 --> 23:19.265
Exotic plants like that
are hard to come by.

23:19.353 --> 23:21.122
It's an expensive present.

23:24.726 --> 23:27.262
Ahh.

23:27.296 --> 23:29.565
(sighs)

23:31.501 --> 23:34.184
It was from someone who
gave me everything I wanted

23:34.235 --> 23:37.138
except a minute of his time.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.784
Well, time is our only
real currency.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.820
Hm.

23:48.406 --> 23:52.468
Meeting you was the most
important part of my experiment.

23:52.709 --> 23:54.223
Is that a fact?

23:54.323 --> 23:55.737
Hm. No, it's not a fact.

23:55.829 --> 23:58.242
I, uh, only meant to say
that your dahlia,

23:58.343 --> 24:00.094
that may be important
to my research.

24:00.201 --> 24:01.630
Mm-hmm.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.264
Hit me again, Mike.

24:03.327 --> 24:05.533
Or maybe not,
I don't know.

24:05.567 --> 24:07.336
Right now it's just a theory.

24:21.763 --> 24:24.966
So, what's all this fuss
about my dahlia?

24:25.102 --> 24:27.172
How do I know I can
really trust you?

24:28.321 --> 24:31.057
The truth will set you free.

24:37.165 --> 24:38.304
The ID number
matches the one

24:38.354 --> 24:40.022
that came through
the wormhole.

24:42.171 --> 24:44.237
But that's probably
just a coincidence.

24:44.338 --> 24:47.275
You people don't believe
in coincidences.

24:47.344 --> 24:49.379
Sure we do.
Yeah.

24:49.507 --> 24:50.893
Einstein himself said that

24:50.928 --> 24:54.406
they're God's way of
remaining anonymous.

24:56.138 --> 25:00.084
So, your machine working
was total happenstance.

25:00.119 --> 25:02.841
No. No, that was me.
I did it.

25:02.989 --> 25:05.960
I'm the one that came up with
the idea that made it work.

25:06.119 --> 25:07.888
And what was that?

25:09.464 --> 25:11.209
The rotation of the earth.

25:11.288 --> 25:13.554
The biggest obstacle
in opening a wormhole

25:13.621 --> 25:16.156
is creating enough energy.

25:16.244 --> 25:17.695
Not unlike
the tremendous amount of energy

25:17.800 --> 25:21.636
that an entire planet makes
as it spins on its axis.

25:21.761 --> 25:24.071
The power is there.

25:24.377 --> 25:26.103
I didn't have to generate it.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.130
I just thought of a way
to utilize it.

25:30.586 --> 25:32.794
Kind of like us.

25:32.915 --> 25:35.417
I mean, the energy's there.

25:35.499 --> 25:38.136
We just got to think of
a way to use it.

25:49.013 --> 25:51.515
(both breathing heavily)

26:33.087 --> 26:35.389
(elevator bell dings)

26:35.433 --> 26:38.337
(high-pitched screeching)

26:45.277 --> 26:47.462
(high-pitched screeching)

26:50.210 --> 26:51.516
(echoing) Jim?

26:51.598 --> 26:52.982
Are you okay?

26:53.100 --> 26:54.640
(echoing) Chuck.

26:54.726 --> 26:56.670
You found me.

26:56.704 --> 26:57.902
Technology's
come a long way.

26:58.006 --> 27:00.127
Not being found is hard.

27:01.158 --> 27:03.632
I think we sent this
to ourselves.

27:18.918 --> 27:20.872
Chuck...

27:20.988 --> 27:22.757
You were right
about the girl.

27:25.093 --> 27:27.682
Jim: 5, 4...

27:27.870 --> 27:30.845
3, 2...

27:30.880 --> 27:33.417
Chuck: Jim.
Jim, Jim.

27:33.607 --> 27:37.097
The pressure dropped below 029.
We have to abort.

27:37.169 --> 27:40.219
All right, abort.
It's that damn bracket again.

27:40.356 --> 27:42.123
We're gonna have to
reconfigure the output.

27:42.204 --> 27:44.681
It might take a while
to recalibrate.

27:44.745 --> 27:46.998
Chuck: Why don't you
take a break?

27:51.775 --> 27:53.422
Jim: <i>I like your lighter.</i>

27:53.526 --> 27:55.682
Take it, it's yours.

27:56.521 --> 27:59.224
Needs fuel.
Hand me those matches.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.044
So, my flower's
really the same one

28:03.079 --> 28:05.916
that came through
your wormhole?

28:06.202 --> 28:09.305
I'd have to run some tests
to know for sure.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.864
What's my finder's fee?

28:15.028 --> 28:17.330
What?

28:17.458 --> 28:19.661
Abby: Okay, fine.

28:19.812 --> 28:22.448
I'll settle for one
butterfly kiss.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.784
(chuckles softly)

28:29.882 --> 28:31.350
(chuckles)

28:41.753 --> 28:43.283
It's a match, Jim.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.203
Identical DNA match.

28:47.398 --> 28:51.065
KMC 0-14, you're the first
organism to time-travel.

28:51.167 --> 28:53.528
Yes, but in
a parallel-universe scenario,

28:53.563 --> 28:56.094
we have to consider that
the Klaus Meisner Corporation

28:56.129 --> 28:59.091
- may not have...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.426
- What did you just say?
- Parallel universe?

29:01.507 --> 29:04.386
- We have to...
- No, no.

29:04.433 --> 29:06.146
Klaus Meisner Corporation.

29:06.210 --> 29:09.480
KMC 0-14.
Klaus Meisner Corporation 0-14.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.696
They license exotic plants
and flowers for domestic use.

29:12.731 --> 29:14.252
- (cellphone ringing)
- We have to take into account

29:14.351 --> 29:16.138
the very distinct possibility

29:16.201 --> 29:18.821
that these two plants
when they traversed...

29:18.856 --> 29:19.659
Jim Beale.

29:19.731 --> 29:21.345
Man: <i>I have Klaus Meisner
for you.</i>

29:21.404 --> 29:22.808
Yeah, put him through.

29:22.975 --> 29:25.624
Klaus: <i>Mr. Beale, you have
the dahlia in your possession.</i>

29:25.658 --> 29:29.270
Yes.
Did she tell you that?

29:29.348 --> 29:31.959
<i>I want you in my office
to go over the contracts.</i>

29:31.993 --> 29:33.336
What's going on here?

29:33.411 --> 29:34.749
<i>You're about to get fucked.</i>

29:34.784 --> 29:36.061
(click)

29:36.096 --> 29:38.065
(sighs)

30:06.492 --> 30:08.427
Klaus: <i>Logic.</i>

30:08.492 --> 30:11.294
<i>Rationale.
Dignity.</i>

30:11.390 --> 30:16.360
<i>All seem to disappear with
the scent of that perfume.</i>

30:16.441 --> 30:19.389
<i>Good reason, common sense,
they just go by the wayside</i>

30:19.424 --> 30:21.659
<i>'cause of the way her hair
breaks across her forehead</i>

30:21.694 --> 30:25.623
<i>and frames her eyes.
The total reckless abandon</i>

30:25.703 --> 30:29.652
that you have absolutely no
control over, Mr. Beale.

30:29.782 --> 30:30.891
Have a seat.

30:31.004 --> 30:33.462
I prefer to stand when I'm
getting it from behind.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.074
You watch your tone.
If you're gonna come at me,

30:36.109 --> 30:37.567
you better come hard and fast
and be willing

30:37.653 --> 30:40.681
to go all the way,
because I never lose.

30:40.782 --> 30:42.305
Klaus, listen.

30:42.398 --> 30:44.143
You call me Mr. Meisner.

30:44.201 --> 30:45.937
My best friends and associates
call me Klaus,

30:45.972 --> 30:47.700
but you, sir,
are neither.

30:47.781 --> 30:50.232
You are an employee.

30:50.328 --> 30:52.273
I don't work for you.

30:53.845 --> 30:56.625
The hard cost
of one unit of M.R.D.

30:56.718 --> 30:58.957
is $5 million,
give or take a little.

30:59.035 --> 31:04.433
What for you is a small fortune
is for me negligible.

31:04.539 --> 31:07.959
I've lost larger sums
in the cushions of my sofa.

31:08.053 --> 31:12.596
But you need M.R.D. for
your machine to work.

31:12.631 --> 31:16.589
Therefore you come to me,
hat in hand, begging.

31:16.732 --> 31:20.281
Forty-nine percent of my project
hardly makes you my boss.

31:20.335 --> 31:22.024
Well, this is true,
but you need tangible proof

31:22.112 --> 31:23.648
that your prototype works,

31:23.714 --> 31:26.974
evidence that you've actually
created a traversable wormhole.

31:27.056 --> 31:28.494
And to do that,
you need to be able

31:28.529 --> 31:33.449
to send the original specimen,
which is registered as KMC 0-14,

31:33.484 --> 31:36.045
back through
to the other side.

31:36.241 --> 31:38.552
Now...

31:38.752 --> 31:42.942
It just so happens that
I own all copyrights,

31:43.008 --> 31:46.052
commercial and private,
for all KMC products,

31:46.170 --> 31:48.405
which means...

31:48.869 --> 31:51.271
This is your lucky day.

31:51.399 --> 31:54.293
I'm willing to sell to you
those rights

31:54.328 --> 31:58.824
for let's say,
50% of your operation.

31:59.047 --> 32:02.378
Now, if you put that together
with the 49% I already own...

32:02.453 --> 32:06.104
Let's crunch the numbers,
that leaves you with...

32:06.223 --> 32:09.549
One percent for your efforts.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.794
Now, if you want to
finish this experiment

32:11.829 --> 32:14.765
that leads to
the invention of time travel,

32:14.873 --> 32:17.285
then you, Mr. Beale,
work for me.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.489
You are an employee.

32:22.030 --> 32:24.064
So you slipped up.

32:24.098 --> 32:26.833
Had a moment of weakness.

32:26.908 --> 32:30.619
I have to admit, she's
an incredible piece of ass.

32:30.676 --> 32:32.672
But you and I both know
you're not gonna walk away

32:32.730 --> 32:34.047
from the find of the century

32:34.112 --> 32:37.214
because of whose name's gonna
end up in the textbooks.

32:37.419 --> 32:40.017
(echoing) Like our little friend
said, you're Tesla,

32:40.115 --> 32:44.186
and I'm quite content being just
another Edison of the world.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.090
(high-pitched screeching)

33:00.073 --> 33:01.409
(screeching stops)

33:09.523 --> 33:11.092
(whirs)

33:12.832 --> 33:14.204
Jim Beale.

33:14.282 --> 33:15.552
Project log, final entry

33:15.587 --> 33:18.821
before zero hour
of the experiment.

33:20.454 --> 33:21.897
A piercing sound
has been cutting through

33:21.993 --> 33:23.575
every synapse of my brain
ever since

33:23.629 --> 33:26.124
I opened the first end
of the wormhole.

33:26.186 --> 33:28.352
It's finally ceased.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.310
Hopefully for good.

33:31.546 --> 33:34.610
Klaus Meisner has me
on the ropes.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.361
He knew that I needed
a correlative between side "a"

33:37.466 --> 33:40.160
and side "b" to prove that
the machine works.

33:40.222 --> 33:42.889
Otherwise, it's just a bunch
of blinking lights.

33:43.041 --> 33:44.814
<i>I mean, if I send the dahlia
back to myself,</i>

33:44.849 --> 33:46.132
<i>then he owns my machine.</i>

33:46.228 --> 33:47.740
Wait, what are you doing?

33:47.915 --> 33:50.343
I'm taking it back
to its rightful owner.

33:50.487 --> 33:53.011
The one variable in this
is Abby.

33:54.723 --> 33:57.656
<i>And I need her
to be a constant.</i>

33:57.747 --> 33:59.920
<i>So if the fate of my machine
is predetermined,</i>

34:00.001 --> 34:03.537
<i>it has to be because of her
that the dahlia goes through.</i>

34:03.641 --> 34:05.735
She has to be the one to put it
through the wormhole.

34:05.829 --> 34:07.197
(elevator bell dings)

34:08.752 --> 34:11.989
<i>If she brings it to the lab,
if she comes there with Klaus...</i>

34:13.306 --> 34:17.210
that is very
fucking unfortunate,

34:17.245 --> 34:19.214
but at least I will know.

34:24.818 --> 34:26.786
(muffled conversation)

34:27.054 --> 34:29.056
(sighs)

34:40.286 --> 34:41.435
Jim.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.998
I really wasn't expecting you.

34:44.085 --> 34:45.911
You don't have
to invite me in.

34:46.005 --> 34:49.284
Good. It's a bit of a mess
in there at the moment.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.768
The gun is to my head.

34:51.944 --> 34:55.699
But I'm sure as shit not gonna
pull the trigger myself.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.750
This is yours.

34:57.891 --> 35:00.395
You get to decide
what happens.

35:01.356 --> 35:04.416
In two days, I'm gonna
start the machine,

35:04.516 --> 35:06.733
and I'll open the wormhole.

35:07.861 --> 35:10.603
But now it's up to you
what goes through it.

35:12.812 --> 35:14.780
You have to make the choice.

36:08.484 --> 36:10.620
Mr. Meisner, would you be
so kind as to wait here

36:10.692 --> 36:13.660
while I escort Ms. Ross
and her dahlia

36:13.711 --> 36:15.680
to the lab floor?

36:24.519 --> 36:26.756
So, this is the way
it's gonna be?

36:28.079 --> 36:29.913
It's the way it has to be.

36:30.010 --> 36:32.045
The way it is.

36:32.180 --> 36:33.655
It only seems that way now,

36:33.740 --> 36:36.910
but eventually you will see it
in a different light.

36:40.793 --> 36:42.861
We had our time together.

36:52.062 --> 36:53.864
Goodbye, Jim.

36:58.379 --> 36:59.981
Put these on.

37:01.598 --> 37:03.800
Wouldn't want you
to miss a thing.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.450
(hissing)

37:15.896 --> 37:18.539
5, 4...

37:18.614 --> 37:21.451
3, 2...

37:21.766 --> 37:22.986
1.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.813
Matty: M.R.D. in place.

37:24.917 --> 37:26.508
Jim: Close hatch.

37:26.543 --> 37:31.141
Turn handle left 45 degrees.

37:35.510 --> 37:37.478
Lock it at high noon.

37:39.139 --> 37:40.975
Engage sequence.

37:54.363 --> 37:58.834
Commence graviton resonance.

38:04.506 --> 38:07.793
You may own the dahlia,
but you don't own me.

38:07.893 --> 38:10.162
(whooshing)

38:57.478 --> 38:59.238
(breathing heavily)

38:59.327 --> 39:01.462
(alarm blares)

39:14.643 --> 39:16.845
(buzzing)

40:00.849 --> 40:02.584
Do you have a light?

40:04.064 --> 40:05.159
Matches?

40:05.194 --> 40:06.918
Two sticks I can
rub together?

40:06.953 --> 40:08.388
Yeah.

40:16.457 --> 40:17.785
Recognize that?

40:17.837 --> 40:19.060
Should I?

40:19.110 --> 40:21.411
It's yours.

40:21.594 --> 40:23.430
It is now. Thanks.

40:25.837 --> 40:28.806
What you and Klaus are doing
is wrong, and it has to stop.

40:28.872 --> 40:30.712
- Excuse me?
- I know what you're up to,

40:30.761 --> 40:32.930
and I'm not gonna
let it happen again.

40:34.308 --> 40:36.222
That's none of your business.

40:36.323 --> 40:39.360
It'll be my business if you
and I get involved.

40:39.446 --> 40:42.229
Does this technique
usually work for you?

40:42.263 --> 40:44.188
Or have you been cooped up
in the lab too long,

40:44.238 --> 40:47.407
- you've forgotten how to flirt?
- Listen, I'm onto you.

40:47.702 --> 40:49.432
I should have known that
someone as intelligent

40:49.467 --> 40:50.997
and as beautiful
as you are, I should have

40:51.078 --> 40:53.874
known there had to be
some kind of catch.

40:54.888 --> 40:56.588
There is a catch.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.408
(echoing) It's a big one.

41:00.824 --> 41:04.318
- (buzzing)
- (gasps)

41:04.672 --> 41:06.541
(door closes)

41:15.865 --> 41:18.661
Where did you
just come from?

41:18.919 --> 41:21.220
I should be asking you.
How did you do that?

41:21.255 --> 41:23.089
- What?
- That.

41:23.209 --> 41:24.667
How did you get here?

41:24.792 --> 41:26.252
You didn't just walk
through a wormhole?

41:26.347 --> 41:29.215
You're making me
feel like I did.

41:29.296 --> 41:30.292
I just met you.

41:30.380 --> 41:32.883
(echoing) Then why are you
acting like you know me?

41:34.735 --> 41:36.070
I don't.

41:47.104 --> 41:48.772
(door closes)

42:07.567 --> 42:09.186
Tell me, Matty, again
where it was.

42:09.221 --> 42:10.444
It was exactly right here.

42:10.541 --> 42:11.760
You and I both almost
stepped on it.

42:11.814 --> 42:13.755
I didn't. I didn't see it
when I came in.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.452
I would've seen it, Matty.

42:15.513 --> 42:16.794
When I was on the stairs,
I came here,

42:16.829 --> 42:18.637
and I almost tripped on it.

42:19.683 --> 42:22.884
Jim? I thought you were
at dinner with Klaus.

42:23.137 --> 42:24.506
I am.

42:26.547 --> 42:28.249
Let's try this.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.560
That's my phone.

42:30.595 --> 42:32.509
Now, call it with yours.

42:39.971 --> 42:42.189
(cellphone ringing)

42:42.283 --> 42:42.832
(beep)

42:42.867 --> 42:44.948
- It went to voicemail.
- (beep)

42:45.073 --> 42:47.877
Right. Try it again.

42:47.966 --> 42:48.982
(scoffs)

42:49.017 --> 42:50.490
(dialing)

42:50.524 --> 42:51.691
(cellphone ringing)

42:51.725 --> 42:53.460
It's ringing.

42:54.712 --> 42:56.613
- (beep)
- Jim: <i>Chuck, what do you got?</i>

42:56.647 --> 43:00.142
- What are you doing?
- <i>Uh, talking to you.</i>

43:00.176 --> 43:03.102
What time do you have
exactly to the second?

43:03.136 --> 43:08.107
<i>What? 9:45:22, 23.
Come on, get on with it.</i>

43:08.177 --> 43:09.539
It could be an imposter.

43:09.696 --> 43:11.798
Ask him something
only you and I know.

43:11.832 --> 43:14.899
Uh, when did you and I
first meet?

43:14.970 --> 43:16.286
<i>What is this?</i>

43:16.379 --> 43:18.284
Just tell me.
It's important.

43:18.319 --> 43:20.200
<i>Uh, 10 years ago
at that karaoke bar</i>

43:20.235 --> 43:21.420
<i>with the weird name.
What's going on?</i>

43:21.477 --> 43:23.971
Ten years ago at the karaoke
bar with the weird name?

43:24.064 --> 43:25.350
I didn't know that.

43:25.419 --> 43:27.186
<i>Chuck, you there?</i>

43:27.306 --> 43:28.607
Now, tell me not to
trust Abby Ross.

43:28.696 --> 43:31.125
She's just using me.

43:31.379 --> 43:33.617
What? No.

43:33.685 --> 43:36.422
You're my best friend.
I will understand.

43:40.243 --> 43:42.473
So, we've been friends
a long time.

43:42.534 --> 43:45.702
- We trust each other?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

43:46.948 --> 43:49.383
Stay away from that girl.
She's no good for you.

43:49.622 --> 43:51.560
<i>What?</i>

43:51.620 --> 43:55.790
Just don't tell her or anyone
else about the experiment.

43:56.074 --> 43:59.244
We're onto something much bigger
than we imagined.

44:00.488 --> 44:02.655
(beep)

44:02.830 --> 44:04.769
- So, that happened.
- What is it?

44:04.892 --> 44:07.441
Matty, you ever been to
a Native American orgy?

44:07.538 --> 44:10.476
- No.
- It's fucking intense.

44:11.827 --> 44:13.167
I don't get it.

44:13.213 --> 44:14.306
If I'm doing
my math correctly,

44:14.341 --> 44:15.439
then there is
a good chance that

44:15.484 --> 44:16.774
I'm on my way here
right now.

44:16.809 --> 44:20.013
- How do you know?
- 'Cause it's what I did before.

44:25.509 --> 44:27.211
(door opens)

44:27.488 --> 44:29.424
(door closes)

44:31.025 --> 44:32.732
I'm telling you, this is
where I'm coming next.

44:32.784 --> 44:34.752
We don't know that for sure.

44:34.817 --> 44:36.476
We need to keep you
isolated from the world

44:36.573 --> 44:39.615
as much as possible to avoid
any collisions of causality.

44:39.704 --> 44:42.739
But my being here hasn't
effected any real change yet.

44:42.855 --> 44:44.047
That we know about.

44:44.082 --> 44:45.359
We have to make sure
that the machine

44:45.394 --> 44:46.680
doesn't fall into
the wrong hands.

44:46.714 --> 44:49.066
Uncover the conspiracy
before it's too late.

44:49.224 --> 44:50.988
What are you now,
a secret agent?

44:51.087 --> 44:54.757
You're a scientist,
and as a man of science,

44:54.846 --> 44:57.995
you need to step back,
breathe,

44:58.067 --> 45:02.671
and take a moment
to properly analyze the data.

45:02.874 --> 45:04.150
Jim: Fine.

45:04.290 --> 45:05.322
Let me stay here and observe

45:05.419 --> 45:08.478
this strange new habitat
I've encountered.

45:08.858 --> 45:10.396
Oh.

45:10.542 --> 45:12.238
What is this?

45:12.317 --> 45:14.985
(gasps)
It's a remote control.

45:15.215 --> 45:17.569
In our time, we use it to
operate the television.

45:17.631 --> 45:19.223
Oh, wow.

45:19.335 --> 45:23.439
In the future, we control
the TV with our minds.

45:23.757 --> 45:25.030
Chuck: Oh, right.

45:25.170 --> 45:26.758
You're only five days
ahead of us.

45:26.831 --> 45:28.652
This isn't a game.

45:28.808 --> 45:31.394
You're now part of
the experiment, Jim,

45:31.440 --> 45:32.736
the same as the dahlia.

45:32.771 --> 45:35.881
That means we have to
study you the same way,

45:35.922 --> 45:37.740
follow the process.

45:37.806 --> 45:39.808
I need you to go
step by step

45:39.843 --> 45:42.185
and tell us exactly
how you did it.

45:42.220 --> 45:43.999
What did it feel like?

45:44.058 --> 45:46.832
The wormhole opened.
I jumped in.

45:46.867 --> 45:47.968
(sighs)

45:48.026 --> 45:50.187
I don't know why you're
being so obtuse.

45:50.222 --> 45:51.622
Because we're wasting time

45:51.700 --> 45:53.840
sitting around here
yapping about it.

45:53.874 --> 45:56.807
We must take action.
I got duped.

45:56.901 --> 45:58.445
We have to strike back.

45:58.479 --> 46:02.715
We can't do anything until we
fully understand what happened.

46:02.842 --> 46:05.979
We are messing with the primal
forces of nature here.

46:07.314 --> 46:08.428
The primal forces of nature

46:08.463 --> 46:10.305
are telling me I have
to take a piss.

46:10.340 --> 46:11.742
(sighs)

46:15.865 --> 46:18.801
(beep, door opens)

46:20.247 --> 46:22.434
What are you
doing here, Jim?

46:22.496 --> 46:24.242
I went to the lab.
You guys were gone.

46:24.277 --> 46:25.881
You should go back.
We'll meet you there.

46:25.939 --> 46:27.545
No, no, no, you called.
You said something...

46:27.580 --> 46:28.325
We were onto something.

46:28.415 --> 46:30.884
And what was this stuff
about Abby?

46:31.175 --> 46:33.711
(indistinct talking)

46:38.019 --> 46:39.377
My head is killing me.

46:39.442 --> 46:40.596
See?
I told you

46:40.631 --> 46:42.035
you need to stop
popping those pills

46:42.070 --> 46:44.106
and get some sleep.

46:44.573 --> 46:45.305
What did you mean earlier

46:45.340 --> 46:46.897
when you were
talking about Abby?

46:46.981 --> 46:48.950
Let me get you some pills.

46:52.852 --> 46:55.221
Stay in here.
Don't come out,

46:55.256 --> 46:58.826
no matter what you hear.
Give me the aspirin.

47:00.131 --> 47:01.438
Matty: <i>Chuck, I get it now.
It makes sense.</i>

47:01.473 --> 47:04.475
<i>I finally see it now.
Fucking intense.</i>

47:04.510 --> 47:05.878
(Jim groaning)

47:06.046 --> 47:08.720
Matty, stop.
You're giving Jim a headache.

47:08.755 --> 47:09.995
No, this isn't a headache.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.413
This, this is
a lightning storm

47:11.448 --> 47:13.910
between my temples.
(groans)

47:14.050 --> 47:15.369
What were you
saying earlier?

47:15.404 --> 47:16.735
When we were on the phone,
you said something about

47:16.770 --> 47:18.666
not trusting Abby
and then we were

47:18.701 --> 47:22.671
onto something bigger.
(groans loudly)

47:23.306 --> 47:24.799
Matty: <i>No, no, no.</i>

47:24.910 --> 47:25.992
- No, no, no, no.
- Matty.

47:26.027 --> 47:27.043
This is far too much
to calculate.

47:27.078 --> 47:29.365
You have to keep it together.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.504
- Matty, look at me.
- You can't... No, no.

47:31.539 --> 47:34.061
Look at me.
Sing the pi song.

47:34.222 --> 47:36.357
<i>♪ 3.14159 ♪</i>

47:36.510 --> 47:37.381
Yeah, there you go.
Sing it.

47:37.416 --> 47:39.984
- <i>♪ 265358 ♪</i>
- Yeah.

47:40.167 --> 47:43.236
<i>♪ 93238... ♪</i>

47:43.850 --> 47:45.780
(door closes)

47:45.881 --> 47:47.650
Jim.

47:51.872 --> 47:53.574
Shit.

47:54.942 --> 47:57.779
Time travel made that guy
a real asshole.

48:16.251 --> 48:17.369
(beeping)

48:17.438 --> 48:19.706
(intercom ringing)

48:20.120 --> 48:22.022
(beep)

48:25.118 --> 48:26.680
The drink offer
is rescinded.

48:26.797 --> 48:28.612
<i>Okay.</i>

48:28.701 --> 48:32.105
<i>But what about coffee?
Does that count?</i>

48:32.419 --> 48:35.287
<i>I never had a chance
to finish my coffee.</i>

48:35.322 --> 48:36.294
What do you want, Jim?

48:36.383 --> 48:39.006
<i>Look, I know I left
without saying goodbye,</i>

48:39.041 --> 48:41.242
<i>but if you let me back up,
I just want a chance</i>

48:41.277 --> 48:44.013
<i>to apologize for leaving
the way that I did.</i>

48:46.812 --> 48:49.916
(beeping)

49:43.588 --> 49:45.524
So, let's hear it.

49:47.677 --> 49:50.577
It better be good if you want
to see what's underneath.

49:50.634 --> 49:53.435
I know what's underneath...
trouble.

49:53.609 --> 49:56.397
Do I really have to explain
how this works?

49:56.520 --> 49:58.821
You grovel at my feet.

49:58.972 --> 50:00.808
And then...

50:00.890 --> 50:02.825
I came here with a plan.

50:04.104 --> 50:06.091
There's so much that
I want to say.

50:06.126 --> 50:09.505
(muffled voices)

50:09.581 --> 50:11.416
I don't know where to start.

50:14.656 --> 50:17.793
(voices talking backwards)

50:20.911 --> 50:22.095
There's certain tribes
in the Amazon

50:22.133 --> 50:25.023
where women use shamanistic
ritual to control their men

50:25.063 --> 50:27.205
by driving them to insanity.

50:28.636 --> 50:30.415
Are you a shaman?

50:30.490 --> 50:33.373
No, I'm just a girl.

50:36.388 --> 50:37.857
I'm sorry.

50:40.260 --> 50:42.028
I'll take it.

51:05.653 --> 51:08.556
(intercom ringing)

51:15.178 --> 51:16.795
- (sighs)
- (electricity crackles)

51:16.830 --> 51:18.532
- Ow!
- Ow!

51:19.244 --> 51:20.757
(static)

51:20.825 --> 51:23.332
<i>Is this the residence
of Abby Ross?</i>

51:25.114 --> 51:26.890
<i>She's not here.</i>

51:26.951 --> 51:27.861
This is Jim Beale.

51:27.896 --> 51:30.366
<i>I'm a friend of hers.</i>

51:30.441 --> 51:33.677
Hey, sleepyhead,
looking for me?

51:33.781 --> 51:35.686
<i>Is there a man
in your place?</i>

51:35.721 --> 51:38.222
Abby: <i>I guess you buzzed
my neighbor by accident.</i>

51:38.348 --> 51:41.698
- <i>I need to see your flower.</i>
- <i>Wow, classy.</i>

51:41.786 --> 51:42.585
<i>I am a lady.</i>

51:42.620 --> 51:45.723
<i>You can at least buy me
breakfast first.</i>

52:03.176 --> 52:05.143
Jim: <i>The biggest obstacle
in opening a wormhole</i>

52:05.271 --> 52:07.034
<i>is creating
enough energy.</i>

52:07.199 --> 52:08.695
<i>Not unlike the tremendous
amount of energy</i>

52:08.776 --> 52:12.311
<i>that an entire planet makes
as it spins on its axis.</i>

52:12.428 --> 52:13.773
<i>The power is there.</i>

52:13.873 --> 52:16.441
<i>I just thought of a way
to utilize it.</i>

52:29.164 --> 52:31.055
Double or nothing
if I hit it again.

52:31.126 --> 52:32.962
I'll take those odds.

52:35.527 --> 52:37.060
The booze just hit me.

52:37.328 --> 52:38.938
Not much of a drinker.

52:39.558 --> 52:43.595
(indistinct talking)

53:22.925 --> 53:25.694
(indistinct talking)

55:13.222 --> 55:15.090
Give me that.

55:18.405 --> 55:20.174
Ready?

55:29.815 --> 55:31.751
(door opens)

55:35.249 --> 55:37.816
Not being found is hard.

55:37.890 --> 55:40.681
Especially when there's
two of you.

55:40.779 --> 55:43.616
That's not me, 'cause I'm
sitting right here.

55:43.651 --> 55:45.724
He might as well be
some other guy.

55:45.826 --> 55:47.047
But it's not.

55:47.082 --> 55:48.969
That is you a week younger.

55:49.045 --> 55:51.663
But from now on, she's only
gonna be with me.

55:51.876 --> 55:53.509
How can you know that?

55:53.544 --> 55:56.296
Because that's what I'm
about to make sure of.

55:56.331 --> 55:58.883
Whoa, Jim. Jim!

55:59.145 --> 56:00.888
This isn't some
relationship problem.

56:00.935 --> 56:02.370
It's a little bigger than you
and that girl.

56:02.405 --> 56:04.058
Not to me.
Not anymore.

56:04.093 --> 56:06.176
You can't go around
changing the past

56:06.273 --> 56:07.644
because you got
your feelings hurt.

56:07.679 --> 56:09.186
This is not the past for you.

56:09.221 --> 56:12.055
I'm not changing anyone's past
but my own.

56:12.191 --> 56:13.426
No matter what happens
to that guy,

56:13.491 --> 56:15.290
I'm still gonna feel
this way, right?

56:15.397 --> 56:16.388
I have no idea.

56:16.462 --> 56:18.417
You're the first person
to ever do this.

56:18.452 --> 56:20.413
Well, then the only way that
I know how to fix my past

56:20.494 --> 56:22.599
is by taking control
of my future.

56:22.660 --> 56:23.870
What about the fact
that she's using you

56:23.960 --> 56:25.561
to get to the machine?

56:25.624 --> 56:28.021
She's not.
She's using him.

56:28.056 --> 56:29.999
And that puts me in
a fantastic position

56:30.034 --> 56:32.223
to turn it all around.

56:46.081 --> 56:48.084
(grunts)

56:52.433 --> 56:54.267
Jim?

56:54.434 --> 56:56.071
You okay?

56:56.162 --> 56:57.195
Chuck.

56:57.487 --> 56:58.925
You found me.

56:59.224 --> 57:00.442
Technology's
come a long way.

57:00.516 --> 57:02.166
Not being found is hard.

57:02.251 --> 57:03.585
(door closes)

57:27.222 --> 57:29.222
You taste like ash.

57:29.608 --> 57:32.479
(intercom ringing)

57:33.936 --> 57:35.504
Who's that?

57:38.054 --> 57:40.910
Just ignore it.
They'll go away.

57:41.217 --> 57:42.704
Will they?

57:42.821 --> 57:43.983
They will.

57:44.172 --> 57:46.841
(ringing continues)

57:50.626 --> 57:52.028
(beep)

57:56.708 --> 57:58.677
It's Klaus.

58:00.623 --> 58:03.093
Then definitely ignore it.

58:04.464 --> 58:06.433
Doesn't he know I'm here?

58:07.969 --> 58:10.205
I don't care
if he knows or not.

58:10.376 --> 58:11.424
Well, tell him.

58:11.478 --> 58:13.946
Tell him everything is going
according to plan.

58:15.026 --> 58:16.465
- What are you talking about?
- Answer it.

58:16.500 --> 58:19.685
I want to hear what you two
have to say to each other.

58:19.720 --> 58:21.487
Fine.

58:24.435 --> 58:26.404
(beep)

58:26.639 --> 58:29.284
I can't invite you in, Klaus.
Jim Beale is here,

58:29.350 --> 58:32.993
and he's about to fuck
the shit out of me again.

58:33.192 --> 58:34.594
(beep)

58:46.516 --> 58:48.812
Well, what are you
waiting for?

58:50.830 --> 58:53.020
I just cut off my only source
of income for you,

58:53.061 --> 58:56.029
so better make it worth it.

58:56.064 --> 58:57.969
So you do work for him.

58:58.091 --> 58:59.320
He was funding my research.

58:59.355 --> 59:01.957
You're working on
a time-travel project for him.

59:02.120 --> 59:04.245
It's not for him.

59:04.298 --> 59:05.932
So why is he
paying you for it?

59:06.027 --> 59:07.451
You know,
for a brilliant man,

59:07.486 --> 59:08.895
you really are quite dense.

59:08.930 --> 59:11.056
Please, enlighten me.

59:11.329 --> 59:12.202
Don't make me say it.

59:12.290 --> 59:14.934
Come on, the truth will
set you free, remember?

59:20.544 --> 59:23.555
'Cause I was fucking him,
all right?

59:24.118 --> 59:25.958
Yeah, he paid my bills
and my rent,

59:25.993 --> 59:28.396
and whatever else I needed.

59:28.514 --> 59:30.450
So then why me?

59:31.757 --> 59:33.917
It ended for me the night
you and I first met,

59:33.952 --> 59:36.759
but it wasn't official
until right now.

59:36.901 --> 59:39.903
So you jump at the first guy
who comes along?

59:39.999 --> 59:42.319
I mean, you must have had
ulterior motives

59:42.385 --> 59:44.454
to fuck me like you did.

59:45.838 --> 59:48.340
You are being
a childish asshole.

59:54.077 --> 59:55.415
And you're right.

59:55.594 --> 59:57.562
I was using you.

59:57.684 --> 59:59.432
I was using you
for my research.

59:59.521 --> 01:00:03.680
A ploy to steal my ideas
for your nefarious scheme.

01:00:05.698 --> 01:00:07.166
So, what is it?

01:00:07.364 --> 01:00:09.666
Let's get all the cards
on the table.

01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:13.286
It's... it's not done yet.

01:00:13.362 --> 01:00:15.353
Waiting for my next move, huh?

01:00:15.388 --> 01:00:17.381
Well, you're making it.

01:00:17.585 --> 01:00:19.621
You want to see
what I'm working on?

01:00:23.214 --> 01:00:25.951
I'll be down at the pub
drinking this day off.

01:00:34.566 --> 01:00:36.092
Abby: <i>Working in secret
for two years</i>

01:00:36.127 --> 01:00:38.633
<i>in a hidden lab
on the outskirts of the city,</i>

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:43.055
<i>John Bane's prototype had
become the stuff of legend.</i>

01:00:43.747 --> 01:00:47.426
<i>They say he invented
a time machine.</i>

01:00:47.574 --> 01:00:49.042
<i>But what no one knew</i>

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:51.739
<i>was that only moments
before I met him,</i>

01:00:51.805 --> 01:00:53.374
<i>it had actually worked.</i>

01:00:53.409 --> 01:00:54.942
Do you have a light?

01:00:55.043 --> 01:00:56.428
<i>I knew everything
there was to know</i>

01:00:56.478 --> 01:00:58.950
<i>about John Bane
the physicist,</i>

01:00:59.076 --> 01:01:01.299
<i>but I never imagined
I would get to know</i>

01:01:01.334 --> 01:01:03.694
<i>John Bane the man.</i>

01:01:06.152 --> 01:01:08.288
Jim: A science fiction novel.

01:01:10.015 --> 01:01:12.451
More of a novella
at this point.

01:01:15.674 --> 01:01:17.174
Your hero, John Bane,

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:19.379
that's supposed to be me.

01:01:22.531 --> 01:01:23.698
There was
an article about you

01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:25.936
<i>that inspired the idea, yeah.</i>

01:01:26.022 --> 01:01:28.143
<i>But once I met you...</i>

01:01:28.212 --> 01:01:30.026
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

01:01:30.098 --> 01:01:32.628
<i>John, a physicist named
John Bane.</i>

01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:34.482
The whole story got
a lot more involved.

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:37.228
That's why it's not done yet.

01:01:37.332 --> 01:01:39.534
<i>I wanted to see
how it played out.</i>

01:01:41.019 --> 01:01:43.654
Yeah, but it's
not actually me.

01:01:43.727 --> 01:01:46.028
<i>It's just a version of me.</i>

01:01:46.086 --> 01:01:48.966
<i>It doesn't have my memories
or feelings.</i>

01:01:49.481 --> 01:01:51.648
(both chuckle)

01:01:51.964 --> 01:01:54.593
That's unfortunate.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.802
Abby: <i>If we only had time.</i>

01:01:57.579 --> 01:01:59.352
<i>Time to get closer.</i>

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:01.389
I'm just a girl.

01:02:01.533 --> 01:02:04.069
The girl of my dreams.

01:02:04.212 --> 01:02:06.948
<i>We could have a chance
of something real.</i>

01:02:10.694 --> 01:02:14.050
<i>I led myself to believe
in serendipity.</i>

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:18.994
<i>But the cosmos had a cruel way
of making me believe otherwise.</i>

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.974
<i>As the day of the final
experiment grew near,</i>

01:02:22.081 --> 01:02:24.418
<i>I wondered if we had
a future together.</i>

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:26.991
<i>Or would fate keep us apart?</i>

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.484
What happens from here on out
is up to me.

01:02:31.565 --> 01:02:34.034
That's why I'm here with you
right now.

01:02:36.684 --> 01:02:38.347
But you can't change fate.

01:02:38.383 --> 01:02:42.147
It's like trying to make
the sun set with your mind.

01:02:44.255 --> 01:02:46.207
Who's to say I can't?

01:02:58.022 --> 01:02:59.737
(sighs)

01:02:59.973 --> 01:03:01.281
See that?

01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:03.836
That right there...
I did that.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.470
Tell me I didn't.

01:03:05.553 --> 01:03:07.652
Scientists
and their god complex.

01:03:07.734 --> 01:03:09.110
(both chuckle)

01:03:09.277 --> 01:03:12.714
(coughing)

01:03:14.643 --> 01:03:16.749
I'm supposed to be
the smoker here.

01:03:16.783 --> 01:03:18.985
(coughing)

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:28.270
(coughing)

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:32.947
- Are you okay?
- Chuck: Jim, are you okay?

01:03:34.324 --> 01:03:36.426
(shouting)

01:03:52.605 --> 01:03:54.807
(cellphone ringing)

01:04:06.483 --> 01:04:08.474
- Jim?
- <i>It's not Jim.</i>

01:04:08.542 --> 01:04:10.791
<i>It's Abby. There's something
wrong with Jim.</i>

01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:12.313
<i>He's coughing up blood,
and he's...</i>

01:04:12.404 --> 01:04:14.759
<i>he's been having seizures,
and I don't know what to do.</i>

01:04:14.816 --> 01:04:16.584
<i>Can you please...
can you please come?</i>

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:18.604
<i>He won't let me take him
to the hospital.</i>

01:04:18.662 --> 01:04:21.067
- <i>I'm just...</i>
- Abby, Abby.

01:04:21.145 --> 01:04:22.483
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Don't do anything

01:04:22.563 --> 01:04:25.998
until I get there.
Don't call anyone.

01:04:26.225 --> 01:04:28.248
Don't do anything.

01:04:28.337 --> 01:04:30.488
- I'm coming.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:04:30.522 --> 01:04:32.625
(beep)

01:04:47.439 --> 01:04:48.822
Wait, what are you doing?

01:04:48.876 --> 01:04:50.944
Uh...
Tell Jim Prime

01:04:50.979 --> 01:04:53.014
I'm taking this
to a specialist for more

01:04:53.049 --> 01:04:55.471
intensive examination.

01:05:02.002 --> 01:05:03.203
Where's the other one?

01:05:03.364 --> 01:05:06.539
Chuck took it to an examinist
for further specialization.

01:05:06.585 --> 01:05:08.587
Must be who called.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.328
Wait, what are you doing?

01:05:10.557 --> 01:05:12.992
I'm taking it back to its
rightful owner.

01:05:21.302 --> 01:05:22.507
Wormhole.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.809
Such a weird word
when you think about it.

01:05:24.843 --> 01:05:26.035
(coughing)

01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:27.293
Chuck: Right now
he's experiencing

01:05:27.328 --> 01:05:31.346
what can only be described as
a kind of temporal feedback.

01:05:31.423 --> 01:05:34.213
It seems that two beings
of the same consciousness

01:05:34.295 --> 01:05:36.998
cannot exist
in the same universe.

01:05:40.661 --> 01:05:43.310
This must be nature's way
of correcting the anomaly.

01:05:43.393 --> 01:05:46.622
That's your diagnosis?
Temporal feedback?

01:05:46.699 --> 01:05:49.135
That makes the most sense
given what we know.

01:05:50.615 --> 01:05:54.445
Okay, Dr. Chuck, if you're
such an expert on space cancer,

01:05:54.547 --> 01:05:57.549
then what should we expect
from here?

01:05:57.849 --> 01:06:00.660
If the rate of deterioration
stays in sync with 0-14,

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:03.166
terminus...
that's what we call...

01:06:03.231 --> 01:06:05.266
I get it. What?

01:06:05.534 --> 01:06:09.571
He has about 48 hours,
give or take.

01:06:09.801 --> 01:06:12.262
Then his vital organs
will disintegrate

01:06:12.357 --> 01:06:15.240
until his biological functions
shut down.

01:06:15.363 --> 01:06:17.999
He's been chosen
for extinction.

01:06:18.201 --> 01:06:20.619
You have one hell
of a bedside manner.

01:06:20.693 --> 01:06:21.760
(sighs)

01:06:21.841 --> 01:06:24.697
I'm a physicist,
not an M.D.

01:06:25.612 --> 01:06:28.208
How am I supposed to believe
any of this?

01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:30.145
(knock on door)

01:06:46.399 --> 01:06:47.899
Now's your chance.

01:06:47.981 --> 01:06:49.367
This is your proof
right here.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.697
But please handle with care.

01:06:51.818 --> 01:06:54.288
The fate of the universe
is in your hands.

01:07:00.138 --> 01:07:02.007
(door opens)

01:07:04.657 --> 01:07:05.799
Jim.

01:07:05.884 --> 01:07:08.520
<i>I really wasn't
expecting you.</i>

01:07:11.216 --> 01:07:12.179
You might want to hide
in the other room

01:07:12.214 --> 01:07:13.903
- in case he comes in.
- He won't.

01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:15.680
He thinks Klaus is in here.

01:07:15.804 --> 01:07:17.554
No need to tell me
who's in there.

01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:20.945
- I have my theory.
- And what is that?

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:24.215
I'm not giving any more
theories to you.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:28.024
It's not why I came here.
It's not what I want from this.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.346
And what do you
want from this?

01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:34.803
To ignore the facts, give you
the benefit of the doubt.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.325
All of the observable evidence

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.911
leads to
the inevitable conclusion

01:07:39.992 --> 01:07:42.594
that you are playing me.

01:07:43.096 --> 01:07:45.508
But I refuse to accept it.

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:49.425
I barely know you.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:54.040
But something happened in those
brief hours we spent together.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.675
It was how you
looked at me.

01:07:57.771 --> 01:07:59.839
Like how you're
looking at me now.

01:08:01.038 --> 01:08:02.889
Is the pain worse
when he's close by?

01:08:02.966 --> 01:08:04.702
Yeah.

01:08:07.205 --> 01:08:09.687
Proximity to him
must be a factor.

01:08:09.812 --> 01:08:13.030
The best course of action
is to get you out of town

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:15.634
as far as possible to alleviate
the effects of the feedback.

01:08:15.698 --> 01:08:17.606
You mean
prolong the inevitable.

01:08:17.684 --> 01:08:21.423
So, here it is.
My act of faith.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.866
The gun is to my head.

01:08:24.188 --> 01:08:27.678
I'm sure as shit not gonna pull
the trigger myself.

01:08:28.259 --> 01:08:30.359
This is yours.

01:08:30.684 --> 01:08:33.380
You get to decide
what happens.

01:08:33.497 --> 01:08:35.541
In two days, I'm gonna
start the machine,

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.368
and I'm gonna
open the wormhole.

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:43.094
But it's now up to you
what goes through it.

01:08:49.134 --> 01:08:51.071
(door closes and beeps)

01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:04.122
Chuck, I want you
to take your friend

01:09:04.157 --> 01:09:05.441
and get the fuck
out of here.

01:09:05.529 --> 01:09:07.777
- Okay.
- Abby.

01:09:07.872 --> 01:09:09.176
You lied to me.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:10.794
Not about me and you.

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:13.412
Me and you is all totally
based on bullshit.

01:09:13.497 --> 01:09:14.645
If you could just see
my logic on this.

01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:16.290
Don't.

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:18.375
There's an explanation
for all of it.

01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:20.345
Not for how I feel.

01:09:20.379 --> 01:09:23.473
I'm not even sure who I'm
talking to right now,

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:26.203
but whatever Jim you are,

01:09:26.285 --> 01:09:28.002
I want you to get the hell
out of my house

01:09:28.107 --> 01:09:32.479
before I contract
this psychotic disease.

01:09:32.557 --> 01:09:35.046
I don't think that temporal
feedback is contagious.

01:09:35.081 --> 01:09:36.850
No.

01:09:38.015 --> 01:09:39.884
(groaning)

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:40.996
(car door closes)

01:09:41.031 --> 01:09:42.832
(beep)

01:09:43.316 --> 01:09:45.404
(cellphone ringing)

01:09:45.519 --> 01:09:48.158
Matty?
Where's Jim Prime?

01:09:49.965 --> 01:09:53.491
I need you to slip away
and meet me at our place.

01:09:55.092 --> 01:09:57.201
Tell him that you left your
reading glasses at home.

01:09:57.236 --> 01:09:59.594
He knows you're useless
without them.

01:09:59.726 --> 01:10:00.944
Then break them

01:10:00.979 --> 01:10:03.710
and tell him you have to
go get your other pair.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.828
Just do it, and...

01:10:07.454 --> 01:10:09.523
Bring D-29B.

01:10:12.724 --> 01:10:15.047
Dextro 29 boost.

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:17.490
Still in beta.

01:10:17.775 --> 01:10:21.705
It's a hybrid synthesis of
adrenal epinephrine secretions.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.902
- Oh, yeah.
- It won't keep you alive.

01:10:23.974 --> 01:10:25.422
- Oh.
- But when you take it,

01:10:25.504 --> 01:10:27.893
- you won't know you're dying.
- I'm dying.

01:10:27.999 --> 01:10:30.314
I'm dying, yes.

01:10:30.515 --> 01:10:33.014
Yeah, okay.
All right, what to do?

01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:35.030
What to do? What to do?
I'm dying.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.354
Dying.
Death, dead, 48 hours.

01:10:37.435 --> 01:10:39.579
Forty eight hours. We have to
prevent that, don't we?

01:10:39.614 --> 01:10:42.724
- We do. We should.
- I say we don't do anything.

01:10:42.897 --> 01:10:44.244
Don't open the other end
of the wormhole.

01:10:44.279 --> 01:10:45.395
Then it's like
it never happened.

01:10:45.451 --> 01:10:46.747
- Have you considered...
- I'm here.

01:10:46.828 --> 01:10:48.992
It happened.
Yes... yes, it did.

01:10:49.069 --> 01:10:50.443
- But have you considered...
- Yes, it did.

01:10:50.478 --> 01:10:53.513
No, we roll up our sleeves.
We find a workable solution,

01:10:53.587 --> 01:10:54.888
to explain the absence
of paradoxes...

01:10:54.985 --> 01:10:56.818
We have to get one of you
out of here.

01:10:57.008 --> 01:10:58.443
Let's come clean
with Jim Prime.

01:10:58.477 --> 01:10:59.849
He can go, and you can live.

01:10:59.912 --> 01:11:02.345
He's not gonna do it if he
knows he will die.

01:11:02.455 --> 01:11:03.662
Would you?
No, you wouldn't.

01:11:03.697 --> 01:11:05.532
I wouldn't.
I've been... I mean, I did.

01:11:05.598 --> 01:11:07.868
- I'm here, so...
- There is the notion...

01:11:07.903 --> 01:11:09.303
Maybe it should be me
that goes.

01:11:09.338 --> 01:11:10.880
And make things worse?

01:11:10.957 --> 01:11:12.924
- The theory...
- Are you joking?

01:11:12.993 --> 01:11:14.793
Is he joking?
Make things worse?

01:11:14.827 --> 01:11:15.996
I have less
than two days to live.

01:11:16.031 --> 01:11:17.455
I lost the rights
to my life's work.

01:11:17.528 --> 01:11:18.723
My girlfriend,
she hates me,

01:11:18.773 --> 01:11:20.313
so how could it possibly
get any worse?

01:11:20.348 --> 01:11:22.334
Parallel dimensions.

01:11:23.236 --> 01:11:25.398
Parallel dimensions.

01:11:25.433 --> 01:11:27.656
There exists not one
singular universe,

01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:30.260
but an infinite number
of possibilities coinciding

01:11:30.326 --> 01:11:32.600
simultaneously and eternally,

01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:34.038
every conceivable version

01:11:34.073 --> 01:11:35.876
of every being
persisting forward

01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:37.109
in a concurrent reality.

01:11:37.158 --> 01:11:39.528
Your time-space excursion
was not to the past

01:11:39.579 --> 01:11:41.393
of your present universe.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.085
On the contrary,
it was simply

01:11:43.148 --> 01:11:45.357
a migration from
your plane of existence

01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:47.893
to the one adjacent.

01:11:47.927 --> 01:11:49.604
You're operating
independently of yourself

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.770
in an alternate timeline.

01:11:56.058 --> 01:11:57.825
- No.
- But...

01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.503
That's still hypothetical
at this point.

01:11:59.554 --> 01:12:01.316
And, of course, I already
thought of that.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:04.353
But being here,
seeing it for myself,

01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:06.222
everything played out
exactly the same.

01:12:06.267 --> 01:12:08.302
But your journal
accounted for...

01:12:08.337 --> 01:12:10.370
What journal?

01:12:10.718 --> 01:12:11.621
Where did you get this?

01:12:11.673 --> 01:12:14.054
It was in your coat pocket
when you traversed.

01:12:14.089 --> 01:12:15.387
And you've had this
the whole time?

01:12:15.422 --> 01:12:18.330
I was processing it
as a data set.

01:12:18.416 --> 01:12:19.301
It's not my handwriting.

01:12:19.355 --> 01:12:21.656
You were both so busy.

01:12:22.034 --> 01:12:24.129
- This is her book.
- Whose book?

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.429
Abby's.

01:12:25.511 --> 01:12:28.313
- It was alarmingly accurate.
- Matty?

01:12:28.453 --> 01:12:31.338
This is a made-up story,
a work of fiction,

01:12:31.439 --> 01:12:33.672
and an incomplete one at that.

01:12:33.757 --> 01:12:35.709
Okay, enough theorizing.

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:37.604
All right? The machine
should be up and running.

01:12:37.658 --> 01:12:39.514
How much more of this
go juice do you have?

01:12:39.549 --> 01:12:40.268
Enough.

01:12:40.303 --> 01:12:42.203
All right, I'm pulling
the trigger on our best option.

01:12:42.307 --> 01:12:45.101
Klaus only paid for
one unit of M.R.D.

01:12:45.165 --> 01:12:46.439
We can't do this again.

01:12:46.474 --> 01:12:47.841
If I go back
through the wormhole

01:12:47.876 --> 01:12:50.621
knowing what I know now
to that first day,

01:12:50.839 --> 01:12:53.209
we won't have
to do this ever again.

01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:06.138
I can take over from here.

01:13:06.219 --> 01:13:07.207
Where have you been?

01:13:07.297 --> 01:13:10.228
Uh, our mass spectrometer
was on the fritz.

01:13:10.658 --> 01:13:12.841
I wanted to take 0-14
over to the institute

01:13:12.876 --> 01:13:14.190
for final evaluation.

01:13:14.225 --> 01:13:15.291
How's it doing?

01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:16.661
Clean bill of health.

01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:18.842
But they're gonna
keep it tonight so that

01:13:18.887 --> 01:13:20.938
they can run it through the
liquid scintillation counter.

01:13:20.973 --> 01:13:23.175
Okay, as long as they don't
know what it's for.

01:13:23.288 --> 01:13:25.091
They think it's a sample.

01:13:25.273 --> 01:13:26.616
We're almost online.

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:28.402
You want to do
a practice run?

01:13:28.627 --> 01:13:30.529
Absolutely.

01:13:58.152 --> 01:13:58.900
(knock on window)

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.115
Oh, and, Chuck,
dahlia 2.0

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:02.731
is also gone for now,

01:14:02.786 --> 01:14:03.830
so we have to
send something else

01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:05.583
through the wormhole.

01:14:06.929 --> 01:14:09.032
I think I can find
a replacement.

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:15.319
Balance metric pressure
at 057.

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:18.727
Chuck: Metric pressure
sustaining 057.

01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:19.846
Releasing valves.

01:14:19.881 --> 01:14:22.519
(hissing and whirring)

01:14:25.622 --> 01:14:28.066
Docking hatch open and clear.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.256
Chuck: Radioactivity
meters online.

01:14:30.368 --> 01:14:32.104
Ready for exposure.

01:14:34.592 --> 01:14:36.461
Prepare to load M.R.D.

01:14:40.565 --> 01:14:43.368
(hissing)

01:15:07.494 --> 01:15:09.809
M.R.D. removed
from containment.

01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:11.919
Preparing to load.

01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:16.131
Keep full exposure duration
no more than 10 seconds.

01:15:16.248 --> 01:15:18.517
9, 8...

01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:20.063
7...

01:15:20.203 --> 01:15:23.352
Insertion
of M.R.D. commencing.

01:15:23.536 --> 01:15:26.038
5, 4...

01:15:26.157 --> 01:15:28.459
3, 2...

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.295
1.

01:15:30.403 --> 01:15:31.837
M.R.D. in place.

01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:33.443
Close hatch.

01:15:34.612 --> 01:15:37.376
Jim.
Jim, Jim.

01:15:37.419 --> 01:15:39.455
The pressure dropped below 029.

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:41.302
We have to abort.

01:15:42.008 --> 01:15:43.643
All right, abort.

01:15:43.699 --> 01:15:45.188
It's that damn bracket again.

01:15:45.284 --> 01:15:47.284
We're gonna have to
reconfigure the output.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.134
I know how to fix it.

01:15:49.168 --> 01:15:50.398
It might take a while
to recalibrate.

01:15:50.433 --> 01:15:52.144
Why don't you take a break?

01:15:52.233 --> 01:15:54.202
I don't take breaks.

01:15:56.275 --> 01:15:58.139
What about that stack of
readouts in your office?

01:15:58.194 --> 01:16:00.363
Have you gone through
those yet?

01:16:03.352 --> 01:16:04.687
Oh.

01:16:06.321 --> 01:16:08.190
I see what you're doing.

01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:11.355
You do?

01:16:11.694 --> 01:16:13.495
You want me to sleep.

01:16:14.419 --> 01:16:16.119
(sighs)

01:16:16.196 --> 01:16:18.331
You're onto me.

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:20.022
Fine.

01:16:21.029 --> 01:16:24.200
I'll leave you be to work
on that for a bit.

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.547
But I'm not napping.

01:16:30.267 --> 01:16:33.037
(exhales sharply)

01:16:48.197 --> 01:16:50.433
Okay, Jim, get ready.

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:57.669
Matty, close the docking hatch.

01:16:57.703 --> 01:17:00.530
Handle left 45 degrees.

01:17:00.662 --> 01:17:02.073
Slide forward,

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:05.129
then lock at high noon
and engage sequence.

01:17:05.242 --> 01:17:07.510
Chuck, I don't, uh...

01:17:07.779 --> 01:17:10.239
Matty, let's go.

01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:11.477
The left and right...

01:17:11.531 --> 01:17:13.959
Matty, he could come back
any second.

01:17:14.045 --> 01:17:16.313
The left and right,
they're not, um...

01:17:16.434 --> 01:17:17.334
The left and right...

01:17:17.369 --> 01:17:19.981
Matty, you've done it
a thousand times.

01:17:20.071 --> 01:17:21.572
Do it now.

01:17:27.404 --> 01:17:29.834
- (lever cranks)
- (hissing)

01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:33.059
- (beeping)
- (rumbling)

01:17:48.136 --> 01:17:50.338
(alarm blares)

01:18:00.674 --> 01:18:03.778
(powering down)

01:18:06.337 --> 01:18:08.005
(sighs)

01:18:11.343 --> 01:18:12.732
(alarm blares)

01:18:12.826 --> 01:18:16.434
(door opens and closes)

01:18:36.052 --> 01:18:38.453
You're still chasing
after her, huh?

01:18:39.738 --> 01:18:44.709
I never realize that's what
I'm doing... until I do it.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.116
The power to cross
the universe in an instant.

01:18:51.204 --> 01:18:54.279
The impossible dream
becomes possible.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:57.305
All the unbelievable things
you could accomplish,

01:18:57.379 --> 01:19:00.575
the eternal questions
you could answer.

01:19:00.749 --> 01:19:03.347
And you just
want to get laid.

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:04.911
You'd do the same
if it were you.

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:06.592
You're probably right.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:10.552
The machine still works.

01:19:10.633 --> 01:19:13.049
But the M.R.D. is gone.

01:19:13.172 --> 01:19:14.492
We could try
to find the money.

01:19:14.575 --> 01:19:18.017
Thirty six hours?
I don't see how.

01:19:18.267 --> 01:19:20.035
What about Klaus?

01:19:25.312 --> 01:19:27.279
You have seen the future.

01:19:27.556 --> 01:19:30.968
Could buy some stocks,
play the over-under on a game.

01:19:31.119 --> 01:19:33.787
You didn't happen to catch
the news before you left?

01:19:34.025 --> 01:19:35.755
It's over.

01:19:35.869 --> 01:19:37.838
I'm done with the past.

01:19:42.422 --> 01:19:44.391
If this is goodbye...

01:19:46.592 --> 01:19:48.894
Least I could do
is buy you dinner.

01:19:51.744 --> 01:19:53.232
Okay.

01:19:56.219 --> 01:19:57.888
(sighs)

01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:13.678
We'll let Jim Prime keep on
without a clue,

01:20:13.851 --> 01:20:15.669
at least until
you're gone.

01:20:15.817 --> 01:20:18.320
Yeah.
Where's Matty?

01:20:22.386 --> 01:20:24.721
He was devastated
by what he did.

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:26.902
Didn't want to face you.

01:20:27.593 --> 01:20:30.296
(cellphone ringing)

01:20:34.105 --> 01:20:35.323
This is you.

01:20:35.505 --> 01:20:38.207
I mean him.

01:20:38.319 --> 01:20:39.953
I should take this.

01:20:40.094 --> 01:20:42.397
Go ahead and order.
I'll be right back.

01:20:44.269 --> 01:20:45.671
(beep)

01:20:57.685 --> 01:20:59.688
Abby: It's not done yet.

01:21:10.341 --> 01:21:12.444
Chuck told me everything.

01:21:13.519 --> 01:21:15.589
Chuck is an asshole.

01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:19.102
I want to hear it from you.

01:21:20.082 --> 01:21:22.786
Why did you really go
through the wormhole?

01:21:24.147 --> 01:21:26.216
Because my heart was broken.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.285
And you blame me?

01:21:31.337 --> 01:21:35.014
Abby, the only one
to blame here is me.

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:37.510
I did it to myself.

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:47.025
I'm willing to let technology
take some of the fall here.

01:21:47.793 --> 01:21:51.663
(both chuckle)

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:55.323
So, I understand
the only way

01:21:55.361 --> 01:21:57.150
to get the other Jim
into the wormhole

01:21:57.185 --> 01:22:02.089
is to show up tomorrow
with the dahlia and Klaus.

01:22:02.291 --> 01:22:04.366
That is one scenario, yeah.

01:22:04.593 --> 01:22:06.710
One that I would prefer
not to repeat.

01:22:06.808 --> 01:22:08.404
But if it would
save your life...

01:22:08.474 --> 01:22:10.951
It wouldn't, because we're
about $5 million shy

01:22:10.986 --> 01:22:12.955
of there even being
a wormhole.

01:22:13.485 --> 01:22:15.462
I can get the money.

01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:20.968
No.

01:22:21.059 --> 01:22:23.129
Waitress: Any questions
about the menu?

01:22:25.043 --> 01:22:27.778
Can you please
give us a minute?

01:22:29.857 --> 01:22:32.426
But it would be for us.

01:22:32.697 --> 01:22:34.518
Then we can have
more time together.

01:22:34.608 --> 01:22:37.558
Look! I'm not gonna
let you do that.

01:22:37.593 --> 01:22:41.045
It's my choice, not yours.

01:22:41.126 --> 01:22:43.296
Then it'll be your choice.

01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:57.539
Take me as far as you can.

01:23:47.391 --> 01:23:49.492
Checking in?

01:23:49.581 --> 01:23:50.716
Yes.

01:23:50.751 --> 01:23:51.946
Name, please.

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.219
James Beale.

01:23:54.253 --> 01:23:56.155
(beeping)

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:08.264
Seems you are already staying
with us, Mr. Beale.

01:24:09.908 --> 01:24:11.376
What?

01:24:16.538 --> 01:24:17.904
Right.

01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:20.874
I forgot my key card.

01:24:21.003 --> 01:24:23.205
May I get a replacement, please?

01:24:25.778 --> 01:24:28.047
Of course.

01:24:28.323 --> 01:24:31.126
(beeping)

01:25:31.313 --> 01:25:33.115
(beep)

01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:27.019
(breathing heavily)

01:26:32.336 --> 01:26:34.585
Matty: <i>There exists not one
singular universe,</i>

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.248
<i>but an infinite number
of possibilities coinciding</i>

01:26:37.329 --> 01:26:40.099
<i>simultaneously and eternally.</i>

01:26:48.986 --> 01:26:52.170
<i>Every conceivable version of
every being persisting forward</i>

01:26:52.205 --> 01:26:55.305
<i>in a concurrent reality.
Your time-space excursion</i>

01:26:55.372 --> 01:26:57.893
<i>was not to the past
of your present universe.</i>

01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:59.554
<i>On the contrary,
it was simply</i>

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:01.902
<i>a migration from
your plane of existence</i>

01:27:01.969 --> 01:27:03.738
<i>to the one adjacent.</i>

01:27:07.984 --> 01:27:09.692
Abby: <i>John Bane's
time-space excursion</i>

01:27:09.727 --> 01:27:13.086
<i>was not to his own past.
Little did he realize he had</i>

01:27:13.121 --> 01:27:16.711
<i>traveled to the past
of a parallel universe...</i>

01:27:16.874 --> 01:27:20.354
<i>A timeline so similar
to his own,</i>

01:27:21.145 --> 01:27:24.438
<i>he had simply overlooked
the differences.</i>

01:27:25.743 --> 01:27:28.245
<i>An infinite number
of possibilities,</i>

01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:30.580
<i>an infinite
number of choices,</i>

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.888
<i>an infinite
number of outcomes.</i>

01:27:36.176 --> 01:27:38.245
Take me to the Grand Hotel.

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:05.190
(injection hisses)

01:28:09.062 --> 01:28:10.464
(thud)

01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:15.587
Mr. Meisner,
would you be so kind

01:30:15.623 --> 01:30:19.692
as to wait here while I
escort Ms. Ross and her dahlia

01:30:19.833 --> 01:30:21.802
to the lab floor?

01:30:30.265 --> 01:30:32.701
Is this really what you want?

01:30:33.016 --> 01:30:35.339
Isn't there usually champagne
at these things?

01:30:35.424 --> 01:30:37.655
I could kill a whole bottle
right now.

01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:40.625
Oh, so, this is the way
it's gonna be.

01:30:40.776 --> 01:30:42.735
It's the way it has to be.

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.309
The way it is.

01:30:45.806 --> 01:30:47.492
It only seems that way now,

01:30:47.527 --> 01:30:50.233
but eventually you'll see it
in a different light.

01:30:50.353 --> 01:30:52.557
So that's it, then?
It meant nothing.

01:30:58.441 --> 01:30:59.541
Put these on.

01:30:59.606 --> 01:31:01.675
I don't want you
to miss a thing.

01:31:48.997 --> 01:31:52.188
Jim: Turn handle left
45 degrees.

01:31:52.335 --> 01:31:55.070
Slide forward.

01:31:55.333 --> 01:31:57.735
Lock it at high noon.

01:31:57.862 --> 01:31:59.679
Engage sequence.

01:34:27.887 --> 01:34:31.049
I'm not interested,
so don't even try.

01:34:33.539 --> 01:34:36.261
It may not look like it,
but I'm actually working.

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:37.759
Do you know who I am?

01:34:37.794 --> 01:34:39.563
Should I?

01:34:42.883 --> 01:34:45.018
Oh, my God.

01:34:45.537 --> 01:34:48.074
You look just like him.

01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:49.612
Who?

01:34:51.168 --> 01:34:52.536
John.

01:34:53.648 --> 01:34:56.383
A physicist named John Bane.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.026
What a coincidence.

01:34:58.325 --> 01:35:00.784
I'm a physicist.

01:35:01.086 --> 01:35:03.723
They say he invented
a time machine.

01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:05.354
Did he?

01:35:06.958 --> 01:35:09.360
No one knows.

01:35:09.496 --> 01:35:11.063
Anyways, he died
in a lab explosion

01:35:11.098 --> 01:35:12.897
before I got to
interview him.

01:35:12.932 --> 01:35:14.733
Really?

01:35:14.816 --> 01:35:16.375
That's too bad.

01:35:16.471 --> 01:35:19.115
The fire destroyed
all of his work.

01:35:20.191 --> 01:35:22.526
It's sad, really...

01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:24.772
To be so close
to controlling time,

01:35:24.862 --> 01:35:29.336
and then poof...
gone in an instant.

01:35:31.410 --> 01:35:33.211
Time is a great teacher

01:35:33.293 --> 01:35:36.068
that eventually kills
all of its students.

01:35:39.187 --> 01:35:40.755
I like that one.

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.022
That's a good one.

01:35:44.933 --> 01:35:46.936
You have any more?

01:35:48.468 --> 01:35:49.562
Yeah.

01:35:49.650 --> 01:35:51.935
Have a drink with me.

01:35:52.024 --> 01:35:55.348
I'll tell you all about
my time-travel experiment.

01:35:55.609 --> 01:35:58.979
Mine would make
for a much better story.

01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:01.284
Your story is better?

01:36:01.407 --> 01:36:03.476
Is that a fact?

01:36:03.729 --> 01:36:06.832
No, just a theory.

01:36:14.443 --> 01:36:16.299
(chuckles)

01:36:16.388 --> 01:36:18.033
(chuckles)
