WEBVTT

00:13.180 --> 00:14.030
Hey, Calvin.

00:14.230 --> 00:15.490
<i>Hola, mi amor.</i>

00:15.690 --> 00:18.200
Guess what I'm making.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.650
Paella.
Paella.

00:20.650 --> 00:24.990
Yes, the authentic recipe
we learned in "Barthelona."

00:25.820 --> 00:28.710
Well, you know, you could say
Barcelona like an American.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.980
No, I like saying "Barthelona"

00:31.180 --> 00:32.300
like a "Barthelonian."

00:33.060 --> 00:36.220
You know, Calvin, you don't
have to make paella every day.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.700
I still haven't finished
my lunch paella.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.160
Hey, you must have
had a busy day. (chuckles)

00:45.360 --> 00:47.410
Yeah, let's go with that.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.070
And speaking
of getting busy,

00:52.270 --> 00:55.730
you know, we haven't done
that since this morning.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.040
(chuckles)

00:57.240 --> 00:58.700
Calvin, where's my favorite mug?

00:58.900 --> 01:00.890
Oh, I, uh,
I threw it out.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.380
Yeah, I was watching
Jennifer Hudson this afternoon,

01:04.580 --> 01:06.110
and the feng shui
expert said that

01:06.310 --> 01:09.580
you should replace any
chipped or broken item.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.750
But my mug wasn't chipped.

01:11.950 --> 01:13.450
Well, I broke it

01:13.650 --> 01:15.340
when I was trying to
feng shui the kitchen.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.120
Oh, by the way,

01:18.320 --> 01:20.890
Magnum, P.I. thinks we should
get a reverse mortgage.

01:21.090 --> 01:22.450
What you think?

01:25.310 --> 01:26.970
Okay, Calvin,
I know that you've had

01:27.170 --> 01:30.870
a lot of time on your hands
since selling the shop, but...

01:31.070 --> 01:34.870
you got to stop
watching daytime TV.

01:35.070 --> 01:37.310
How about you just
get out the house?

01:37.510 --> 01:39.150
Do something.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.310
Babe, I'm doing things.

01:41.510 --> 01:43.150
I got plenty of stuff to do.

01:43.350 --> 01:45.280
My schedule is jam-packed.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.790
Alexa, what's
on my calendar tomorrow?

01:48.990 --> 01:51.490
ALEXA:
At 03:00 p.m.,
you have a haircut.

01:51.690 --> 01:53.690
Hmm?
Didn't you get a
haircut yesterday?

01:53.890 --> 01:56.880
Yes, Tina.
I'm a very hairy man.

01:59.150 --> 02:02.080
Well, how about you
go out and play some golf?

02:03.020 --> 02:04.820
Well, all my friends work.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.770
Are you trying to get rid of me?

02:07.970 --> 02:10.480
No, no, no, baby.
I just...

02:10.680 --> 02:12.210
I don't think it's very healthy

02:12.410 --> 02:14.580
for a man to stay
at home all day,

02:14.780 --> 02:16.920
or his wife
might kill him.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.450
Oh! I just watched
a Lifetime movie about that.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.210
You know, the lady
got away with it, too.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.460
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

02:25.660 --> 02:27.110
* Welcome to the hood. *

02:32.450 --> 02:35.570
Okay.
Oh, Tina, we can't
take all your paella.

02:35.770 --> 02:38.850
Please take it.
It'll really help my marriage.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.610
Ooh, look, Dave wants some.
He's drooling.

02:41.810 --> 02:43.810
(slurring):
Nah, it's from the dentist.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.490
I'm still numb.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.570
Here, sweetie,
clean yourself up.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.120
So, has it been hard for Calvin
having all this free time?

02:55.320 --> 02:57.820
Hard for me.
He's driving me crazy.

02:58.020 --> 02:59.190
He's always here.

02:59.390 --> 03:01.230
He watches my shows before I do

03:01.430 --> 03:03.230
and then spoils the endings.

03:03.430 --> 03:05.030
You know, I finally
just sent him to Ernie's bar

03:05.230 --> 03:06.200
to give away
some of this paella.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.580
And there's this much left?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.270
You feel my pain.

03:11.470 --> 03:12.460
Ooh.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.770
Mama! Oh.
Hey, guys.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.040
TINA: Hey.
Did a box come for me today?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.310
Oh, yeah, it's right over there.

03:19.510 --> 03:21.850
Um, why did you
have it sent here?

03:22.050 --> 03:23.680
I didn't want Malcolm to see it.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.650
It's a longsword
for my Arthurian groom-posal.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.600
It's a what for the what what?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.260
(chortles)

03:31.460 --> 03:33.130
I'm gonna ask Malcolm
to be my best man.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.080
And then slay him?

03:36.080 --> 03:38.600
Marty's doing a grooms-posal.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.030
They're like prom-posals,
but for your groomsmen.

03:41.230 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, back when I did mine,

03:43.200 --> 03:45.050
society thought
they were only for bridesmaids.

03:45.990 --> 03:48.470
Then I rode into
my friend Bobby's yard

03:48.670 --> 03:51.090
on that horse, shirtless.

03:52.360 --> 03:56.570
I broke barriers
for groomsmen everywhere.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.550
I'm...

03:58.750 --> 04:01.040
I'm-I'm gonna go "shirt on."

04:01.800 --> 04:04.590
But I do want Malcolm
to be blown away.

04:04.790 --> 04:07.790
So, uh, Marty, got all your
groomsmen picked out already?

04:07.990 --> 04:09.900
Yeah. Yeah.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.960
Well, i...
It's only four of us.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.870
It's Malcolm, my two
best friends from college,

04:14.070 --> 04:16.250
and my play
cousin Daniel.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.670
(short chuckle)
S-So he's not even

04:18.870 --> 04:19.940
a real cousin, huh?
David...

04:20.140 --> 04:22.070
Dave, let it go.
You're not in the wedding.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.160
Stop being so thirsty.

04:27.030 --> 04:29.280
(cheering)

04:29.480 --> 04:33.690
Oh, shoot. Ernie's killing it
at cornhole. He's undefeated.

04:33.890 --> 04:35.420
Hey, Calvin,

04:35.620 --> 04:38.120
do you want me to embarrass
you next or should I

04:38.320 --> 04:39.630
crush Trey as a warm-up?

04:39.830 --> 04:42.300
Also, no outside food.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.400
Oh.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.830
It's paella.
I brought you some.

04:46.030 --> 04:48.000
Oh, don't mind if I do.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.750
Winning burns a lot of calories.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.670
Ernie, I haven't seen
you lose in a week.

04:54.870 --> 04:55.840
You juicing?

04:56.040 --> 04:58.140
Nah. No, man.
No, no, no.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.580
I'm just the best holder

04:59.780 --> 05:02.420
anyone's seen
this side of the 405.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.050
Probably the other side, too.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.170
There's just
too much traffic to be sure.

05:08.340 --> 05:11.660
You bragging about
throwing beanbags in a hole?

05:11.860 --> 05:14.040
(giggles)
(mock giggles)

05:17.010 --> 05:19.160
Sound like somebody's scared.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.470
Ooh, I'm terrified.
(chuckles)

05:22.670 --> 05:24.670
What's the next challenge--
hopscotch?

05:24.870 --> 05:27.010
Or maybe <i>Candy Land?</i>

05:27.210 --> 05:29.540
Calvin, just whup his ass
and shut him up.

05:29.740 --> 05:30.440
Man.
Hey.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.240
I-It's ridiculous, man.

05:32.450 --> 05:35.680
This requires no skills.
I mean, anybody could do it.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.400
Watch.

05:41.070 --> 05:42.190
Ha-ha!

05:42.390 --> 05:44.060
Reminds me of the time
we played mini-golf

05:44.260 --> 05:45.770
and you hit that old lady.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.530
It was a bank shot
off her walker.

05:48.730 --> 05:49.800
I still made par.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.350
Ah.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.080
Okay.

05:56.450 --> 05:57.840
ERNIE:
Oh. Oh, yeah.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.810
Close, close, but no cigar.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.140
All right,
this ain't over.

06:01.340 --> 06:03.460
All right, here we go.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.130
(grunts)

06:08.000 --> 06:08.850
Yeah!

06:09.050 --> 06:10.180
(patrons cheering)
Oh!

06:10.380 --> 06:12.670
Boom, baby! In your face!

06:14.040 --> 06:15.820
Okay, Calvin.
All right.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.020
If you feeling so cocky,

06:18.220 --> 06:19.690
then why don't you
play in the tournament?

06:19.890 --> 06:21.160
Mm, nah, I'm good.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.000
Uh-huh. Uh, I-I forgot--
you retired.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.260
You too busy
sitting on the front porch

06:26.470 --> 06:28.000
in a rocking chair.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.290
ALL:
Ooh!

06:31.290 --> 06:33.770
You know what?
I'm in.

06:33.970 --> 06:36.880
And for your information,
it's a glider!

06:37.080 --> 06:38.080
(patrons cheering)

06:38.280 --> 06:40.580
All right.
Well, good luck, Calvin.

06:40.780 --> 06:44.280
Good luck. Oh, did you see
the gallery of champions?

06:44.480 --> 06:46.670
They all look a lot like me,
don't they?

06:48.740 --> 06:51.790
You know, I forget about
the year you had the toupee.

06:51.990 --> 06:54.840
It's called a hair unit.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.030
(knocking)

07:00.230 --> 07:01.820
Hold on.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.290
Oh, my God!

07:11.530 --> 07:13.280
Marty, what is going on?

07:13.480 --> 07:16.550
Malcolm Langston Butler,
first of his name,

07:16.750 --> 07:18.020
you are hereby

07:18.220 --> 07:19.520
commanded to pull

07:19.720 --> 07:21.650
the sword from
yon stone.

07:21.850 --> 07:25.870
Only the true best man
can such a feat achieve.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.060
What?

07:30.260 --> 07:33.530
If thou wouldst be the best man,

07:33.730 --> 07:37.200
thou must pull the very
expensive custom-engraved sword

07:37.400 --> 07:39.610
from yonder stone.

07:39.810 --> 07:43.410
Okay, Marty, obviously
I am going to be your best man.

07:43.610 --> 07:46.140
Uh, did you say "wouldst"?
What does that even mean?

07:46.340 --> 07:48.180
I don't know, man.
Can you just play along?

07:48.380 --> 07:49.680
No, I said I'm in, Marty, okay?

07:49.880 --> 07:51.480
I-I'm doing
all the best man stuff.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.390
I went to the cake tasting,
we went soup shopping.

07:53.590 --> 07:55.450
Okay, if-if you're
not into this,

07:55.650 --> 07:57.160
maybe I'll ask somebody else.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.290
Marty, I'm your only brother.

07:59.490 --> 08:01.660
Who else would you ask
to be your best man?

08:01.860 --> 08:02.710
Derek.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.730
Derek?
Derek has no personality.

08:06.930 --> 08:08.300
He's a board game friend.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.240
You have to be distracted
just to hang out with him.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.400
Well, Derek would
have pulled the sword

08:11.600 --> 08:12.540
from the stone by now, man.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.510
Well, 'cause Derek is a dork!

08:14.710 --> 08:17.340
Great.
You tell him that to his face

08:17.540 --> 08:19.010
when he takes your role
as the best man.

08:19.210 --> 08:20.050
Wha...

08:20.250 --> 08:21.480
From the shadows you come

08:21.680 --> 08:25.270
and to the shadows
I bid you return.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.860
(exclaims)
Almost had it.

08:32.060 --> 08:33.360
(scoffs)

08:33.560 --> 08:36.090
Don't flatter yourself.
You weren't even close.

08:36.290 --> 08:37.730
You're pulling
your left shoulder.

08:37.930 --> 08:39.260
Thanks a lot, Gemma.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.000
But a lot of those bags
went in the hole

08:41.200 --> 08:42.800
before you
broke my concentration

08:43.000 --> 08:44.920
by sneaking up on me.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.010
Okay, you want
to keep missing,

08:48.210 --> 08:49.240
keep doing it your way.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.240
Or you could
square up a bit

08:51.440 --> 08:53.110
and add a little arc
to your toss,

08:53.310 --> 08:54.560
like this.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.690
Damn, woman, you can hole.

08:59.890 --> 09:01.250
Where'd you learn
to play like that?

09:01.450 --> 09:03.420
There wasn't a lot to do
in Hickory Corners.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.690
All we had was corn.

09:04.890 --> 09:06.360
Either you ate it
or you threw it.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.760
Or the crows got it.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.550
On a bad day, all
three could happen.

09:11.310 --> 09:13.870
So, you used to play with corn?

09:14.070 --> 09:15.300
Did you not have Barbie dolls?

09:15.500 --> 09:16.750
Crows got 'em.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.810
That's why I became
so good at cornhole.

09:21.010 --> 09:21.970
Uh, w-wait, wait.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.280
I want to learn how to play.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.480
Cornhole isn't
something you learn.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.450
It's something you become.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.110
When I holed,

09:29.310 --> 09:31.620
I gave myself fully
to the game.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.220
I'd expect you
to do the same.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.950
I'm ready.
No.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.340
No, you're not.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.790
But you will be.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.490
Forget everything you think
you know about cornhole.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.260
I literally know nothing.

09:45.460 --> 09:49.480
Raw clay.
I like it.

09:55.690 --> 09:56.880
Derek?

09:57.080 --> 09:59.780
Derek is gonna be your best man?
Yes, Mom.

09:59.980 --> 10:03.570
Help me remember--
did I carry Derek in my womb?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.180
I think you know you did not.

10:06.380 --> 10:08.950
Then Derek should not
be your best man.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.610
Calvin, back me up.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.360
Listen to your mama, boy.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.740
Ooh!
Four in a row!

10:16.850 --> 10:18.400
Calvin!

10:18.600 --> 10:21.970
What? I'm folding the laundry.
Thanks for noticing.

10:22.170 --> 10:25.640
Stop playing games and help me
talk some sense into this boy.

10:25.840 --> 10:29.340
Uh, Marty, if you want your
brother to be your best man,

10:29.540 --> 10:31.780
you should ask him
like a normal person.

10:31.980 --> 10:33.050
I'm sure he'll say yes.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.680
Well, he did
say yes.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.330
That's not the point, Daddy.
He disrespected my process.

10:39.470 --> 10:40.590
TINA:
Listen, baby,

10:40.790 --> 10:42.520
when you look back
on your wedding

10:42.720 --> 10:44.520
years from now...

10:44.720 --> 10:45.740
(clang)

10:47.240 --> 10:48.530
...you're gonna
want to have those memories

10:48.730 --> 10:49.860
with your brother.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.030
(clang)

10:51.230 --> 10:52.730
Calvin, what the
hell are you doing?!

10:52.930 --> 10:55.100
I'm emptying the dishwasher.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.690
Apparently, I have to do
everything around here.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.360
That was going in.

11:06.260 --> 11:08.410
I mean, it is nonstop, Trey.

11:08.610 --> 11:10.820
One ridiculous wedding event
after another,

11:11.020 --> 11:13.220
a-and the groom-posal
was insane.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.350
There was a rock,
there was a sword,

11:15.550 --> 11:17.170
and then there was
a suit of armor.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.230
So, he did all that just
to ask you to be his best man?

11:22.430 --> 11:24.130
Yes. I mean,
it's ridiculous, right?

11:24.330 --> 11:25.230
Tell me I'm wrong.

11:25.430 --> 11:27.000
You're wrong.
Thank you.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.930
Wait, what?

11:29.130 --> 11:30.670
I'm just saying,
Marty went through

11:30.870 --> 11:33.170
all that trouble to make you
feel loved and appreciated,

11:33.370 --> 11:35.370
and you went
and acted like a jackass.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.690
I did not.
(knocking)

11:40.460 --> 11:43.300
Word on the street is you
were a total jackass to Marty.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.190
I said yes to Marty, okay?

11:47.390 --> 11:49.350
Look, maybe I wasn't as nice
as I could have been...
Okay,

11:49.550 --> 11:50.910
I-I don't care. Uh...

11:52.010 --> 11:54.760
Are you now bumped down
to regular groomsman

11:54.960 --> 11:56.430
or... or are you <i>out</i> out,

11:56.630 --> 11:58.380
and now there's an opening?

11:59.150 --> 12:01.570
Well, I can't be completely
out of the wedding, Dave.

12:01.770 --> 12:04.570
Uh, I mean, look,
I got to do something.

12:04.770 --> 12:08.170
Marty's a big baby,
but he is my baby brother.

12:08.370 --> 12:10.680
You're right.
You're a good brother.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.310
Damn it.

12:12.510 --> 12:15.400
So, what do I do?

12:20.300 --> 12:23.270
Malcolm, go to him.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.990
Yeah, but you got to
do it right.

12:28.190 --> 12:31.660
After what you did,
you need to go all the way.
Yeah.

12:31.860 --> 12:34.200
Meaning I got to
completely humiliate myself?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.330
No, no, not at all.

12:36.530 --> 12:39.140
Now, let's talk
tunics and tights.

12:39.340 --> 12:41.890
Oh...

12:52.430 --> 12:55.800
You do know there's nothing
in your hand, right?

12:56.870 --> 12:58.420
Of course, babe.

12:58.620 --> 13:01.130
The tournament is tonight.
I can't risk injury.

13:01.330 --> 13:03.660
Hey, Tina, would you
do me the honor

13:03.860 --> 13:07.030
of shagging my bags
this evening?

13:07.230 --> 13:08.550
Do what now?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.970
I forgot,
you don't speak hole.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.140
(chuckles)

13:15.340 --> 13:16.940
It means retrieving my bags.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.480
I just need to concentrate
on my throwing.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.920
Alexa, is it windy
in Pasadena tonight?

13:23.120 --> 13:25.280
Hello, Cornhole King.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.550
This evening
in Pasadena, California,

13:27.750 --> 13:30.490
it's breezy
at 14.2 miles per hour.

13:30.690 --> 13:31.790
Hmm.

13:31.990 --> 13:35.380
I'm gonna have to adjust
my arc for the wind.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.670
Did you actually program Alexa
to call you Cornhole King?

13:41.870 --> 13:45.850
Yes. And trust me,
it's starting to catch on.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.210
Uh, you know, Calvin,

13:50.410 --> 13:52.140
I know I encouraged you
to get out of the house

13:52.340 --> 13:53.580
and find something to do,

13:53.780 --> 13:55.350
but don't you think
that maybe you're taking

13:55.550 --> 13:57.350
this Cornhole thing
a little too seriously?

13:57.550 --> 13:59.430
(chuckles)
Don't be ridiculous.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.890
Calvin, <i>bombaye!</i>

14:03.090 --> 14:05.020
Calvin, <i>bombaye!</i>

14:05.220 --> 14:08.030
Calvin, <i>bomba...</i>

14:08.230 --> 14:10.680
Did you people not see <i>Ali?</i>

14:12.210 --> 14:14.430
Calvin, <i>bombaye!</i>

14:14.630 --> 14:18.590
ALL:
Calvin, <i>bombaye!</i>
Calvin, <i>bombaye!</i>

14:23.690 --> 14:25.290
Go, babe!
(cheering)

14:27.100 --> 14:29.450
It's all right, my man.

14:29.650 --> 14:30.680
You can tell your grandkids

14:30.880 --> 14:33.120
you got beat by Calvin Butler.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.700
Go on, now.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.510
Calvin, let's talk management.

14:41.410 --> 14:42.630
What are you celebrating?

14:42.830 --> 14:44.230
You haven't won anything yet.

14:44.430 --> 14:46.710
I just took the semis.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.920
Finish the job!

14:50.220 --> 14:51.700
Sorry, Calvin.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.740
You've had your fun,
but your little lucky streak

14:53.940 --> 14:56.710
ends here.
This is my house.

14:56.910 --> 14:59.080
Yeah, that's because
you lost your real house

14:59.280 --> 15:00.480
in your last divorce.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.220
(exclaiming, chattering)

15:03.420 --> 15:04.680
True.

15:04.880 --> 15:09.090
But not you or my
other exes or the IRS

15:09.290 --> 15:10.290
can take cornhole from me.

15:10.490 --> 15:13.390
Don't you worry, Calvin Butler.

15:13.590 --> 15:14.930
I'll keep the trophy here.

15:15.130 --> 15:16.930
You can come see it
whenever you want.

15:17.130 --> 15:18.400
Oh. Uh,

15:18.600 --> 15:19.700
I'm gonna see it every night

15:19.900 --> 15:21.800
'cause it'll be in my bedroom.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.440
The hell it will.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.520
Hey, uh, shag girl,
you're messing up my trash talk.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.690
(doorbell rings)

15:38.370 --> 15:39.870
Hedwig?!

15:46.440 --> 15:49.560
"Your presence is requested
in Mother and Father's yard

15:49.760 --> 15:52.230
"at the stroke of 9:00.

15:52.430 --> 15:56.300
Yours, magically,
Alan Dumbledore."

15:56.500 --> 15:58.200
(laughs)

15:58.400 --> 16:00.590
It's Albus, but okay.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.960
(laughing)

16:05.960 --> 16:08.650
Who dares approacheth my lair?

16:08.850 --> 16:10.980
You invited me, Dumbledore.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.580
Yes, right.

16:12.780 --> 16:15.750
Approacheth, Grayskull Legolas.

16:15.950 --> 16:17.960
You are mixing
so many different things,

16:18.160 --> 16:19.640
but I love it!

16:22.380 --> 16:23.700
When I cast this spell,

16:23.900 --> 16:25.460
you will no longer remember that

16:25.660 --> 16:28.550
I was dickish unto thee.

16:29.850 --> 16:32.370
And you will once again
welcome me back

16:32.570 --> 16:36.190
as your best friend,
your best brother and...

16:37.390 --> 16:38.990
...your best man.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.670
Kombucha!

16:45.270 --> 16:48.540
Yes. A thousand times yes.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.060
This is unbelievably tense.

16:53.260 --> 16:54.610
It is?

16:55.380 --> 16:58.900
They're tied. They've gone
bag-for-bag this whole round.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.030
The next hole wins.

17:00.230 --> 17:02.020
Ooh, and then we're done?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.440
Oh. Hey, hey.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.070
You hear that, Calvin?

17:07.270 --> 17:09.790
That hole is
calling my name.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.110
ALL:
Ooh!

17:14.310 --> 17:15.410
Yeah.

17:15.610 --> 17:17.350
Oh, I hear it now.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.450
And it's saying,

17:18.650 --> 17:21.170
"You're in second place,
sucker."

17:21.970 --> 17:24.020
Time out. Time out, time out.

17:24.220 --> 17:26.320
Calvin, his bag
is teetering over the edge.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.860
It's air mail time.

17:28.060 --> 17:28.990
Air mail?
Yes.

17:29.190 --> 17:30.260
We practiced this.

17:30.460 --> 17:32.000
No, we didn't.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
We didn't? Crap.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.700
Okay.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.670
You've got to arc high.
Crazy high.

17:38.870 --> 17:40.710
Higher than you've ever
arced in your life.

17:40.910 --> 17:42.810
Your bag's got to come
straight down

17:43.010 --> 17:45.410
through that hole without
taking Ernie's bag in with it.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Delay of game.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.980
Okay, hey, I'm tossing.

17:50.180 --> 17:51.950
I'm tossing, man.

17:52.150 --> 17:53.700
Okay.

17:54.470 --> 17:56.740
* *

18:20.630 --> 18:23.580
Yes! We did it!
We're awesome! (exclaims)

18:23.780 --> 18:26.170
(laughs)
Suck it, loser!

18:28.500 --> 18:30.890
Hey, uh, good game, Calvin.

18:31.090 --> 18:33.490
Yeah, that felt pretty good.
Oh,

18:33.690 --> 18:35.290
need to take your picture
for the wall.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.360
Oh, not without my shag girl.

18:37.560 --> 18:38.850
Nah, I'm good.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.430
Hey, that was, uh

18:42.630 --> 18:44.300
that was some fine holing,
Calvin.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.300
Yeah.
Maybe the best I've ever seen.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.410
It was fun.
Yeah, it was.

18:48.610 --> 18:51.610
Oh, it doesn't have to be over.
See, there's a doubles circuit.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.780
We can take this act
on the road as a team.

18:53.980 --> 18:56.780
There is a tournament
next weekend in Reno.

18:56.980 --> 18:59.320
Now, the way I figure...
Look, sorry, Ernie.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.750
I mean, since I sold the
shop, I have been looking

19:02.950 --> 19:05.620
for something to be
passionate about, but...

19:05.820 --> 19:08.560
this is your thing,
man. All right?

19:08.760 --> 19:10.300
I'm still searching for mine.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.900
Mm. You'll
find it, baby.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.100
Hey, you-you sure
about that, Calvin?

19:16.300 --> 19:18.670
Very.
But you--

19:18.870 --> 19:20.100
you go out there
and give 'em hell.

19:20.310 --> 19:21.440
Hey!

19:21.640 --> 19:23.610
I'll do it.
I'll go with you, Ernie. Reno!

19:23.810 --> 19:25.780
Reno! (laughs)

19:25.980 --> 19:26.710
Hey,

19:26.910 --> 19:27.880
you drive stick?
Yeah.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.350
Uh-huh.
Yeah, you do.

19:29.550 --> 19:30.450
Hey, hey!

19:30.650 --> 19:31.850
You're not
going to Reno.

19:32.050 --> 19:33.790
You're a wife, a mother
and a principal.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.050
CALVIN:
Okay, Gemma,

19:35.250 --> 19:37.420
uh, go home, all right?
Go on, now.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.240
Go.

19:45.150 --> 19:48.020
Something is definitely
wrong with her.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.350
David Seymour Johnson,

20:02.550 --> 20:04.930
first of his name, come forth.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.430
Oh, my God.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.030
Is this happening?

20:15.230 --> 20:17.560
The maiden Necie hath decreed

20:17.760 --> 20:21.330
that the size of her bridal
party will increase by one.

20:21.530 --> 20:23.070
Her cousin Keisha
will be joining us

20:23.270 --> 20:24.720
from the Woods of Ingle.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.100
Huh?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.960
Keisha from Inglewood.

20:30.860 --> 20:35.280
Wilst thou do me
the most high honor

20:35.480 --> 20:37.350
of joining the Groom's Watch?

20:37.550 --> 20:39.600
Wedding is coming.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.840
T'would be my honor, your grace.

20:45.510 --> 20:48.840
With thy very knee
I bendeth like Beckham.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.030
Macchiato!

20:55.230 --> 20:57.020
