Chris.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.220
Mmm.

00:38.260 --> 00:40.770
You ever want to jerk off
with that hand again,

00:40.810 --> 00:43.270
- I suggest you get it
off my ass. -

00:44.480 --> 00:46.520
I like when you talk dirty.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.360
Keep doing it.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.160
Oh!

00:56.700 --> 00:58.580
Fuckin' bitch!

01:02.330 --> 01:04.120

01:22.180 --> 01:23.980
I've got it from here.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.950
Your mother
was cleaning your room.

01:40.990 --> 01:43.830
She found the copies
of Guns & Ammo under the bed.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.290
I know you have certain urges...
it's natural...

01:47.330 --> 01:50.340
but you can't let it get
in the way of your gift.

01:50.380 --> 01:54.380
Sir, I don't want to be
an electrical engineer, sir.

01:54.420 --> 01:56.590
It's not my passion, sir.

01:56.630 --> 01:57.970
You need to face reality.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.890
You're never gonna do what I do.

01:59.930 --> 02:01.970
- Because I'm a girl.
- No.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.520
Because you're too damn smart.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.690
Your brothers,
they could slice a man in half

02:06.730 --> 02:09.229
and then go out for ice cream...
that's not you.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.110
Which is exactly why
I should do what you do.

02:12.150 --> 02:14.190
Instead of them.

02:15.820 --> 02:17.650
I've decided.

02:19.030 --> 02:21.200
I'm signing up.

02:28.460 --> 02:31.080
Go ahead...
and I'll make damn sure

02:31.130 --> 02:33.670
that you spend your
whole career swabbing toilets.

02:35.670 --> 02:39.180
Someday you'll realize
that I'm doing you a favor.

02:39.220 --> 02:42.510
You're not built
to do what I do.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.610
We got to disarm that thing.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.940
Before Dragan finds us.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.420
It's too late.

Knife.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.840
JC, I need a weapon.

03:22.890 --> 03:24.430
You're looking at it.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.690
Come on!

04:14.560 --> 04:17.440
No...!

05:04.820 --> 05:06.490
Copy that.

05:06.530 --> 05:08.120
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

05:14.330 --> 05:15.920

06:19.980 --> 06:22.270
Hmm.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.780
Go upstairs.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.820
Second room on the right,
there's a balcony.

06:32.530 --> 06:34.910
When this turns red,

06:34.950 --> 06:36.370
toss it over the edge.

06:42.670 --> 06:46.420
What does this have to do
with rescuing Luis?

06:48.050 --> 06:49.550
Just trust me.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.900
JC.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.690
Hey, Victor.

07:05.730 --> 07:07.440
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

07:07.490 --> 07:09.990
I'm good. You know, since my
flight out isn't till next week,

07:10.030 --> 07:12.820
I've had the opportunity
to explore Bulgaria.

07:12.870 --> 07:15.330
Such a fascinating country.

07:15.370 --> 07:18.500
- Incredible people. -Always
turning lemons into lemonade.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.750
It will serve you well.

07:19.790 --> 07:21.290
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

07:21.330 --> 07:23.130
It's good to see you, brother.

07:23.170 --> 07:25.590
Oh, word of advice:

07:25.630 --> 07:28.260
Take the role in the musical.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.380
Always listen to the PR people.

07:31.430 --> 07:33.340
And don't forget
to thank your father.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.660
- That was lovely.
- Yeah!

07:56.700 --> 07:57.950
Yes!

07:57.990 --> 08:00.290
Oh. Go get 'em, baby.

08:00.330 --> 08:02.080
Ooh.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.460
Hi, guys.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.920
Hello.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.380
- Hi. Hi.
- Hello. Hello.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.800
My friends.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.850
Are you enjoying my party?

08:21.060 --> 08:26.480
You know, when I was beautiful,
beautiful little boy...

08:26.520 --> 08:28.480
I used to love

08:28.520 --> 08:31.690
to sneak into our town's theater

08:31.740 --> 08:34.820
to watch American action movies.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.909
Yeah!

08:36.950 --> 08:38.280
Yes.

08:38.330 --> 08:41.289
And I learned two things:

08:41.330 --> 08:44.120
to speak the proper English...

08:45.920 --> 08:49.550
...and, more importantly,

08:49.590 --> 08:53.340
they taught me
how life really works.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.800
Fuckin' truth, truth.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.430
- Truth.
- You know, you know.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.760
Absolutely.

08:58.810 --> 09:01.470
You know what I mean.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.770
Two years ago,

09:03.810 --> 09:07.190
I told United Morris Agency

09:07.230 --> 09:08.900
that I would...

09:08.940 --> 09:10.980
finance a movie.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.280
Would you like to see
a little taste

09:19.330 --> 09:20.790
of what we've been making?

09:20.830 --> 09:24.370
Yes! Yes!

09:24.410 --> 09:27.290
Roll it.
Roll it.

09:27.330 --> 09:29.000
Roll that shit!

09:49.150 --> 09:51.820
I pledge allegiance...

09:51.860 --> 09:53.650
to kicking ass.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.240
This is for freedom, justice,

10:00.280 --> 10:01.910
and the Huckleberry way.

10:01.950 --> 10:03.410
Huck, help me!

10:03.450 --> 10:04.750
Come closer, closer!

10:04.790 --> 10:05.790
Huck!

10:07.250 --> 10:09.130
You can't defeat the Confederacy

10:09.170 --> 10:11.590
and end slavery all by yourself.

10:11.630 --> 10:15.420
Maybe not,
but I will have to try.

11:07.430 --> 11:09.100
Fuck yes!

11:09.140 --> 11:10.650
This shit's so hot.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.570
That was close, C-word Jim.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.530
Ah-so, Huck-San.

11:23.490 --> 11:25.450
This summer,

11:25.490 --> 11:28.620
it's time to get Hucked!

11:28.660 --> 11:31.750
A film by Gunnar.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.210
What the fuck?!

11:34.250 --> 11:37.340
Move, move! Move!

11:37.380 --> 11:39.510
You're welcome.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.690
Exciting, huh?

11:54.730 --> 11:58.610
Tom Sawyer like you've
never seen her before.

12:00.490 --> 12:02.410
A movie can be exciting, sure.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.530
But it cannot be exciting

12:04.570 --> 12:08.410
without a real movie star.

12:08.450 --> 12:10.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:10.120 --> 12:12.790
the muscles from Brussels,
Mr. Jean-Claude Van Damme.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.510
Thank you.

12:33.850 --> 12:35.520
Jean-Claude, come up, my friend.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.440
Come up.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.940
Jean-Claude!
Jean-Claude...

12:40.990 --> 12:43.700
Jean-Claude! Jean-Claude...

12:43.740 --> 12:45.160
No, thank you.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.080
Jean-Claude, yes, yes.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.790
Come up, come up, come up.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.410
No, thank you.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.510
I-I mean it.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.760
Jean-Claude, come up.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.560
No.

13:26.570 --> 13:27.660
Fuck!

13:35.370 --> 13:37.500
What the fuck?!
What the...

13:37.540 --> 13:38.750
Get out of the way!

13:47.890 --> 13:52.180
Vanessa... you can come out.

13:52.220 --> 13:54.020
How'd you know I was there?

13:54.060 --> 13:55.890
And what the hell was that ball?

13:55.940 --> 13:57.480
Don't have time to explain.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.520
No, we're supposed
to be partners.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.546
You know I don't like it
when you just tell me to...

14:01.570 --> 14:03.360
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.110
This was always
my favorite part...

14:06.150 --> 14:09.030
the quiet before the storm.

14:09.070 --> 14:10.370
Oh, uh...

14:18.290 --> 14:20.040
Luis!

14:22.880 --> 14:23.960
Wait. Wait!

14:24.010 --> 14:26.170
It's booby trapped.

14:26.220 --> 14:28.180
He's right.

14:28.220 --> 14:31.550
This platform is calibrated
to my exact weight.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.390
If it changes one ounce more,
one ounce less,

14:35.430 --> 14:39.440
the mines will explode,
and I'll be vaporized.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.230
We need to disarm that thing

14:41.270 --> 14:43.150
before Dragan realizes
where we are.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.730
It's too late.

14:49.490 --> 14:50.530
Knife.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.290
Come on.

16:31.670 --> 16:33.630
You had no choice.

16:35.930 --> 16:38.850
- I know.
- Okay.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.640
Does it always feel like this?

16:41.980 --> 16:44.480
If you're lucky.

16:49.690 --> 16:51.400
I have a plan.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.570
I jump on, you jump off.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.160
I told you,

16:56.200 --> 16:59.660
this platform is calibrated
to my exact weight.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.580
You jump on here, you die.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.089
They gave you a sandwich today.

17:11.420 --> 17:12.800
Did you eat it?

17:14.930 --> 17:17.550
No.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.810
Then we weigh
exactly the same amount.

17:23.349 --> 17:25.440
I've been dieting.

17:33.110 --> 17:34.320
Trust me.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.070
Okay.

17:40.410 --> 17:42.080
One...

17:42.120 --> 17:44.370
two...

17:46.080 --> 17:47.330
three.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.550
Huh.

18:04.430 --> 18:06.890
Gracias.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.150
How did you do that?

18:11.980 --> 18:13.400
Vanessa.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.030
Thank God. I'm so sorry.

18:16.070 --> 18:19.370
Someone tasered me and locked me
in the trunk of a car.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.040
Ah!

18:23.080 --> 18:24.620
Filip?

18:24.660 --> 18:27.040
Is that you?

18:27.080 --> 18:28.920
Not this time.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.790
Then who?

18:31.840 --> 18:35.630
I'm you from the future.

18:35.670 --> 18:37.470
And I'm here to correct

18:37.510 --> 18:39.930
a grave error.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.520
No!

18:50.520 --> 18:51.900
A Timecop?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.190
Something like that.

18:57.240 --> 19:00.950
If you're really me
from the future,

19:00.990 --> 19:04.540
tell me something that,
uh, only I would know.

19:07.250 --> 19:11.540
You tried to fill
the emptiness with fame.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.920
It didn't work.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.880
You have a big hole
in your heart

19:16.920 --> 19:19.170
because you don't think that...

19:20.800 --> 19:23.180
...you will ever be loved.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.270
Will I... be loved?

19:34.230 --> 19:35.610
I hope so.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.160
Aah!

19:41.200 --> 19:43.030
Oh!

19:43.070 --> 19:43.950
You.

19:43.990 --> 19:45.620
Aah!

19:47.830 --> 19:49.710
There you are.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.710
You killed all my friends.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.090
You sprained my neck, buddy.

19:57.130 --> 20:00.590
And then you tied me to a tree

20:00.630 --> 20:01.970
deep in the woods.

20:02.010 --> 20:03.220
Deep in the woods!

20:03.260 --> 20:04.470
Aah!

20:04.510 --> 20:05.510
Filip, stop.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.270
Oh.- ♪ ♪

20:13.810 --> 20:15.020
Timecop.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.900
Timecop!

20:18.940 --> 20:21.860
Timepoliceman, technically.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.320
Excuse me?

20:24.370 --> 20:25.570
Uh...

20:25.620 --> 20:29.330
Timecops don't exist.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.460
No.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.560
- Take the shot.
- What shot?

20:48.600 --> 20:50.470
I don't have the shot.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.930
But he does.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.450
Oh, shit.

21:16.330 --> 21:19.710
They found the control room.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.010
Get me Meni Mano.

21:26.470 --> 21:27.800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:27.850 --> 21:30.220
Uh-huh.

21:33.310 --> 21:34.940
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

21:34.980 --> 21:39.360
You killed your future self.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.320
Oh.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.030
Huh.

21:43.070 --> 21:44.900
Then I'm a Looper.

21:44.950 --> 21:48.660
At least you know how you die.

21:51.490 --> 21:52.750
Oh.

21:58.670 --> 21:59.920
Wait!

21:59.960 --> 22:01.590
Oh.

22:01.630 --> 22:04.970
It's the only way
to save my friends

22:05.010 --> 22:07.890
and to save me... from you.

22:07.930 --> 22:09.930
- Oh.
- No.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.220
From you!

22:11.260 --> 22:12.970
Aah!

22:13.020 --> 22:14.560
Oh!

22:20.650 --> 22:23.030
He's a Timecop.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.490
And now...

22:34.040 --> 22:36.750
Now, that... now,
that's Filip now, right?

22:45.380 --> 22:47.800
Congratulations.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.590
I see you've discovered
my weather control room.

22:50.640 --> 22:54.180
I spent years developing
a drug empire to finance

22:54.220 --> 22:56.310
this device.

22:56.350 --> 23:00.020
And now it's all
going to pay off.

23:00.060 --> 23:03.770
The world will be mine.

23:03.820 --> 23:05.280
Give me the chip.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.780
Not a chance.

23:09.070 --> 23:11.910
Of course.

23:11.950 --> 23:15.370
You know, one of
the greatest joys of my life

23:15.410 --> 23:19.410
has been to be hunted
by a secret agent.

23:19.460 --> 23:23.250
And not just
any secret agent, no.

23:23.290 --> 23:24.500
The star of...

23:24.550 --> 23:26.130
Double Impact!

23:27.170 --> 23:28.380
Which is why

23:28.420 --> 23:30.180
I have brought someone

23:30.220 --> 23:34.970
very special to fight you today.

23:35.010 --> 23:36.930
You cannot imagine the expense

23:36.970 --> 23:39.690
of procuring a great henchman.

23:39.730 --> 23:41.850
The search for
a disturbed orphan

23:41.900 --> 23:43.400
with the right disability,

23:43.440 --> 23:44.980
the training,

23:45.020 --> 23:48.690
paying for hundreds and hundreds
of prosthetic hands!

23:50.820 --> 23:53.030
But it was all worth it
for this moment.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.550
In Bulgaria,
he is known as Meni Mano,

24:07.590 --> 24:12.260
which is slang
for a man who smashes things

24:12.300 --> 24:16.600
with great big stone fists.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.020
But I like
to keep things simple.

24:19.060 --> 24:21.190
Let me introduce

24:21.230 --> 24:24.520
Marble Hands.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.230
As they say
in American romantic comedies,

24:28.280 --> 24:33.820
he is everything
I never knew I always wanted.

24:33.860 --> 24:37.080
If you're a fan, you should know

24:37.120 --> 24:40.500
what happens next, right?

24:40.540 --> 24:44.040
Oh.

24:44.080 --> 24:48.670
Perhaps in your prime,
Jean-Claude.

24:48.710 --> 24:50.880
But look around you.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.880
This is the real world.

24:52.930 --> 24:55.220
Good-bye, Mr. Van Damme.

25:19.870 --> 25:21.660
Ooh.

25:24.580 --> 25:26.960
Oh!

25:34.170 --> 25:35.130
Ooh...

25:46.560 --> 25:47.690
Get him!

26:12.590 --> 26:15.220
Meni Mano, get up!

26:15.260 --> 26:17.590
Get up, Meni Mano!

26:29.230 --> 26:32.320
Dim mak?

26:32.360 --> 26:34.990
El toque Muerte.

26:35.030 --> 26:37.900
The death touch.

27:03.510 --> 27:04.770
Got to go?

27:04.810 --> 27:06.890
Let me give you a hand.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.540
Hey.

27:35.130 --> 27:37.090
- Not now.
- Huh?

27:41.970 --> 27:44.390
She's all right?

27:44.430 --> 27:47.220
Before you came in here,
she killed him.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.640
It was her first.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.100
She can never go back now.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.480
Where are you going?

27:59.030 --> 28:01.990
All she ever wanted
was to be a part of this world,

28:02.030 --> 28:05.120
and I just want to escape it.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.240
I quit.

28:07.290 --> 28:11.370
Luis, please.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.040
You're a good person.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.960
I can see it on your face.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.140
You don't know
anything about me.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.710
Please exit
in an orderly fashion.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.750
Exit this way, please.

28:56.790 --> 28:59.170
Krisztina,
have you seen Vanessa?

28:59.210 --> 29:02.630
Um, I-I think
I saw her walk outside.

29:07.220 --> 29:09.970
Vanessa, wait, wait!

29:10.020 --> 29:13.390
Wait.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.980
You can't blame yourself.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.690
It's just the job.

29:18.730 --> 29:20.690
It's just a job to you.

29:20.730 --> 29:23.240
That's how you justify
the things you've done.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.910
But I need more.

29:25.950 --> 29:28.200
I need to know
I do this for a reason.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.080
He had a knife.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.160
You're not listening to me.

29:34.210 --> 29:37.500
You never listen to me.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.500
Wait.

29:49.390 --> 29:54.350
The other version of you,
the one from the future...

29:54.390 --> 29:56.810
he said you have
a hole in your heart,

29:56.850 --> 30:00.270
and he's right.

30:00.320 --> 30:05.780
And I've learned
I can't fill that hole.

30:05.820 --> 30:08.030
It's too big.

30:16.290 --> 30:18.880
Vanessa.

30:18.920 --> 30:21.840
Vanessa,

30:21.880 --> 30:24.710
I never ask for nobody's help

30:24.760 --> 30:27.130
in my life.

30:27.180 --> 30:28.760
Nobody.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.180
I need you.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.850
You understand? I need you.

30:39.940 --> 30:41.980
That's not love.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.700
Just let me go.
