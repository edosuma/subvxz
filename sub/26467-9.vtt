00:02.600 --> 00:03.875
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.960 --> 00:05.952
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:07.190
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:11.357
<i>But secretly,
with the help of my friends</i>

00:11.440 --> 00:13.352
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime</i>

00:13.440 --> 00:15.159
<i>and find other
meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>And now our world
is more dangerous than ever,</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:55.760 --> 00:56.760
You failed.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.752
Why are you doing this?

00:58.840 --> 01:01.071
You did this to yourself.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.074
And now all of you will perish.

01:16.520 --> 01:20.275
My name is Dr. John Deegan,
and I, like most of you,

01:20.360 --> 01:22.431
I'm a psychiatrist.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.791
Do you know what my patients
tell me the most?

01:24.880 --> 01:27.520
They feel inferior.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.798
I'm here to tell you,
whether we admit it or not,

01:30.880 --> 01:35.159
some people,
they're just born lucky,

01:35.280 --> 01:38.671
which leads us to
the real problem, imperfection.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.639
How can we ever hope
to feel like

01:41.720 --> 01:45.430
supermen or superwomen

01:45.520 --> 01:49.275
without first becoming
super ourselves?

01:49.360 --> 01:51.431
I'm here to tell
you how, folks.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.639
If we utilize eugenic insights,
I feel...

01:55.760 --> 01:59.674
Hey, Frankenstein, go back
to your mad scientist lab.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.673
Ma'am, ma'am, please...
would you wait, please?

02:02.760 --> 02:04.991
Folks, folks, folks,
please listen.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.277
I'm just saying, we can truly
help our patients.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.919
Listen to me!

02:12.880 --> 02:14.360
Idiots!

02:19.200 --> 02:21.032
<i>Doctor.</i>

02:23.440 --> 02:25.352
<i>Dr. John Deegan.</i>

02:28.000 --> 02:29.719
I need your help, John.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.759
Go find someone else
to prank, douchebag.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.800
My God, what are you?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.190
Something beyond
your comprehension.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.875
I've traveled far
to this place and time

02:42.960 --> 02:46.317
to lay this precious burden
at your feet.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.474
Use this book to reshape
the world as you see fit.

02:50.560 --> 02:55.237
Show them what a real god
can do, John.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.794
Why me?

03:02.880 --> 03:04.678
You have vision.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.958
That book holds the key
to your transformation, John,

03:08.080 --> 03:11.517
and all you have to do
is open it.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.917
<i>Use it wisely, John.</i>

03:20.000 --> 03:22.834
The universe is in your hands.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.515
I can... I can see...

03:25.640 --> 03:27.711
I can see everything.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.157
And a word of advice:

03:31.240 --> 03:33.436
think big.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.750
<i>Honey, breakfast is ready.</i>

03:54.600 --> 03:56.557
<i>Honey.</i>

03:58.600 --> 03:59.875
<i>It'll get cold.</i>

03:59.960 --> 04:01.679
What?

04:19.640 --> 04:21.040
Morning.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.589
Look, babe, they're perfect
this time.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.310
What if Barry walks in?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.392
What if he could have
seen that?

04:29.480 --> 04:30.596
See...

04:30.680 --> 04:32.512
Where's Barry?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.751
Did you get enough sleep
last night?

04:34.840 --> 04:36.911
Look, babe, I know that
we haven't caught Cicada,

04:37.000 --> 04:38.957
but Caitlin's immunity
can help us.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.040
Who's Cicada?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.874
Our big bad.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.872
Barry, are you okay?

04:44.960 --> 04:46.314
I'm Barry?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.958
What is wrong?

04:51.400 --> 04:53.676
Honey, hi.
Talk to me.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.514
I did not get enough sleep.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.035
Are you... you sure
it's not my cooking?

05:02.120 --> 05:03.120
'Cause...

05:03.200 --> 05:05.840
No, no.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.669
These smell delicious.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.114
Thank you.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.236
You know what?

05:10.320 --> 05:12.391
I think that you call
Captain Singh

05:12.480 --> 05:14.199
and you ask for a day off.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.680
Look, with all
the superhero-ing

05:15.760 --> 05:19.071
you've been doing, I think
you've earned it, honey.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.231
You think maybe I should
go into S.T.A.R. Labs?

05:22.960 --> 05:23.960
What... what?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.120
Only my husband would think

05:25.160 --> 05:26.640
working on Speed Force
equations

05:26.760 --> 05:27.876
would be called a day off.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.830
I love you, Barry Allen.

05:32.720 --> 05:37.636
I love you, Iris West-Allen.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.997
Break in at Ivo Labs.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.799
Cisco's on comms.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.678
I'll meet you guys
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.312
Whoa... whoa.

06:01.400 --> 06:05.030
Whew.
That's a rush.

06:06.521 --> 06:08.034
Sorry, I polished it
last night

06:08.120 --> 06:10.191
and left it on our dresser.

06:30.760 --> 06:35.710
Oh, Barry,
what have you done this time?

06:37.880 --> 06:40.270
<i>Barry, we got
a break-in at Ivo Labs,</i>

06:40.360 --> 06:42.158
<i>two armed men
going after diamonds,</i>

06:42.240 --> 06:44.311
<i>the ones they use
for conductors.</i>

06:45.401 --> 06:46.436
Hey, pump the brakes.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.800
<i>You're gonna have
to hang a U-ey,</i>

06:47.840 --> 06:50.753
'cause you passed Ivo
by about 18 blocks.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.840
Found it.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.480
<i>Someone's excited
to get to work.</i>

06:53.840 --> 06:55.752
It is too early for this.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.316
Forget it, Flash.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.194
We're leaving with
the diamonds, or this guy dies.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.033
I said back off.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.736
<i>Hey, what are you
doing there?</i>

07:09.760 --> 07:11.513
Just hit the guy
with the lightning punch.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.759
You have failed this city.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.832
Pretty sure that's
not your line.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.120
Your adrenaline levels
are off the charts.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.310
<i>What's going on?</i>

07:53.600 --> 07:54.750
Overkill much?

07:54.840 --> 07:55.990
<i>Cops are on the way.</i>

07:56.120 --> 07:58.555
<i>Why don't you just let them
take over from here?</i>

08:11.960 --> 08:13.519
So he's fine, Caitlin?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.750
Mm-hmm.

08:14.840 --> 08:15.990
Oh, God, thank goodness.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.037
Really?
There are no anomalies?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.600
I don't... I don't have
a brain tumor?

08:19.680 --> 08:20.680
Nothing?

08:20.760 --> 08:22.353
Barry, you're
in perfect shape.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.836
Babe, tell me about it.
I mean, hi, these abs.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.877
And they're all mine.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.396
Maybe we could lay off

08:29.480 --> 08:30.960
the public displays
of affection,

08:31.040 --> 08:32.315
just at work, you know?

08:32.400 --> 08:33.549
Since when?

08:33.640 --> 08:35.836
You're always saying that touch
is your love language.

08:35.919 --> 08:36.919
That's right, Ralph.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.280
Just feel like we're being
very insensitive to all of you.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.357
Oh, man, we've
talked about this.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.399
I'm over Gypsy, okay?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.437
But I appreciate the thought.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.274
I'll be all right.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.513
I'm gonna go home...

08:54.200 --> 08:56.157
Because I need to think.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.360
Think?

09:04.920 --> 09:06.070
What are you guys doing?

09:06.160 --> 09:07.360
Following you
into the hallway.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.272
'Cause something
is definitely up.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.834
You need
to talk about it?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.036
Yeah, Barry,

09:12.840 --> 09:14.600
you haven't seemed like
yourself all morning.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.994
I'm fine.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.639
I just think that
maybe I should go

09:17.720 --> 09:20.519
and talk with someone who might
better understand

09:20.600 --> 09:22.717
what I'm going through.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.598
I'm gonna go see Oliver Queen.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.070
I'll be back.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.031
Dig, what are you
doing here?

09:36.120 --> 09:37.395
I'm kicking your butt.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.960
Now get up, come on.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.152
You guys redecorate
the Bunker?

09:44.240 --> 09:46.391
Oliver, you've been to ARGUS
a million times.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.075
Oliver?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.911
I'm Oliver Queen.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.229
Yeah, I'll say.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.834
I'm the Green Arrow.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.590
Holy crap.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.150
I've been hanging
with a tough crowd, huh?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.913
Yeah, you think?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.994
Look, I need to make a call,
just to S.T.A.R. Labs,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.311
just for some important
Green Arrow business.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.119
- You know how it is.
- Later.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.873
What's that?

10:29.280 --> 10:30.839
We've got Bratvas
fighting Bertinelli's

10:30.920 --> 10:33.958
over an old Diaz weapons cache
in the Glades.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.793
I could really use some backup,
Oliver.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.714
Oh, man, I don't know
if I'm feeling up for it.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.056
I think I just
tweaked something.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.416
ARGUS rapid response
is on another mission.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.000
We're the only ones
that can make it in time.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.351
- Okay, yeah, I'm in.
- Good.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.035
Suit up.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.032
How do I put this...

10:53.120 --> 10:55.476
I forget, do... do I need
help putting this on?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.360
<i>What are you doing?</i>

11:03.440 --> 11:05.256
<i>I thought you were going to fire
an incendiary arrow.</i>

11:05.280 --> 11:06.350
So did I.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.795
Did you freaking see that?

11:28.880 --> 11:30.599
Stop fooling around
and get the driver.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.640
Damn.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.679
Diggle!

11:41.720 --> 11:42.915
No... no.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.674
Oh, man.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.760
Uh-huh, yeah.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.513
Nice outfit.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.840
This can't be a coincidence.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.720
There... there has to be
a reason behind this,

12:08.800 --> 12:11.110
which means that someone
is responsible.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.558
We need to know who... hey,
can you... can you not do that?

12:15.640 --> 12:18.394
Man, what a total
<i>Freaky Friday.</i>

12:18.480 --> 12:21.359
No, wait,
we didn't switch bodies.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.240
It's more of a <i>Quantum Leap.</i>
Where's a mirror?

12:23.280 --> 12:25.875
Focus, just for a second,

12:25.960 --> 12:28.270
and take this seriously
because the world thinks

12:28.360 --> 12:30.875
that you're Oliver Queen
and that I'm Barry Allen,

12:30.960 --> 12:32.679
and I would really like
to know why.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.679
- Totally.
- Is that cool?

12:33.680 --> 12:34.599
- Yes.
- Thank you.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.795
I'm sorry.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.119
Weird.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.520
Hey, Mayor.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.957
Just, if you could... just
for 90 seconds of seriousness.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.759
You gotta admit,
this is a little cool.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.797
I will find it a lot cooler
when I wake up

12:47.880 --> 12:49.951
in my own bed
tomorrow morning.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.480
You woke up in bed
with Iris?

12:51.560 --> 12:52.994
Mm-hmm.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.799
We have to fix this
right now!

12:56.240 --> 12:57.616
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

12:57.640 --> 13:00.792
You believe you are not
Barry Allen,

13:00.880 --> 13:02.951
but in fact, he is?

13:03.040 --> 13:04.680
Barry, did you
time travel again?

13:04.720 --> 13:05.870
No, I didn't.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.976
- She's talking to Barry.
- Sorry...

13:07.000 --> 13:08.434
I am Barry.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.274
- Yeah, and I'm Wild Dog.
- Easy, Wild Dog.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.555
Sarcasm.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.154
It's not great sarcasm,
Cisco.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.755
- Do you mind if I...
- No, of course not.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.393
Oliver's brain scan
is perfectly normal,

13:21.480 --> 13:24.040
no signs of hypnosis
or psychic interference.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.476
Tachyon meters are clear.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.279
No one's screwing
with the Timeline.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.999
Guys, come on, this is crazy.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.236
I mean, there's no way that

13:31.320 --> 13:32.913
I could be married
to Oliver Queen.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.316
Sorry, but, babe, you know
he's not my type, right?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.120
Iris, you really
don't believe me?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.669
We're telling the truth.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.558
Okay?
We're telling the truth.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.439
Something is very, very wrong
with reality.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.520
Yeah.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.195
All right,
Team Flash meeting.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.280
Not you, Barry.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.714
Th... uh...

13:53.480 --> 13:55.199
I've only got eyes for you,
you know that.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.336
I sw... if you touch her...

13:56.360 --> 13:57.510
I didn't touch her.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.398
You thought about it.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.896
All right, well, if
your team's not gonna help us,

14:02.920 --> 14:03.976
then we have to keep moving.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.056
They'll help us, okay?
They'll help us.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.232
We just gotta get... we just
gotta get Iris on board first.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.376
Good... fine, how... how are you
going to convince her?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.039
I'm not, you are.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.958
- She's your wife.
- I know, man.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.056
I know, I don't... I don't
like this anymore than you do.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.736
You just gotta tell her
how much you care about her.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.036
Tell her she's
your lightning rod.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.199
I'm not... I'm not saying that.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.316
Just say it.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.720
Trust me.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.678
It works every time.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.639
Mind if I join you?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.837
Yeah.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.359
This should help.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.318
I guess you forgot
you can't get drunk?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.153
This day could not
get any worse.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.670
You really think
that you're Oliver?

14:48.760 --> 14:50.479
Yeah.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.360
You know, Felicity called me
when Oliver was in prison.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.159
Do you know how he ended up
in Slabside?

14:58.240 --> 14:59.674
She... she called you?

14:59.760 --> 15:02.150
He cut a deal, Barry,

15:02.240 --> 15:04.038
completely behind
Felicity's back.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.395
He didn't even warn her.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.791
The FBI just showed up
and took him away.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.109
She said all that?

15:10.200 --> 15:12.396
She's hurting.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.200
Oliver's life,
it's completely defined

15:15.280 --> 15:18.956
by anger, vengeance.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.876
That's why I am so lucky
to have you in my life.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.952
Are you not
the least bit worried

15:31.040 --> 15:33.350
that reality
might be broken?

15:33.440 --> 15:36.831
Don't you have to consider what
we're telling you is the truth?

15:36.920 --> 15:38.434
Isn't it possible?

15:38.520 --> 15:41.638
Yeah, yeah, it is,

15:41.720 --> 15:43.313
which is why
I'm really sorry, Barry.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.471
Would you... I thought
I couldn't get drunk.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.673
Nanites, courtesy
of Ray Palmer.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.237
Whoever you are, we need
to get you to a safe place

15:53.320 --> 15:54.959
<i>until we can figure out
what happened.</i>

15:56.080 --> 15:57.309
I hope you can understand.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.800
Oh, come on.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.116
Sorry, dude.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.800
Oh, come on.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.234
Guys, come...

16:18.320 --> 16:20.596
Guys, come on!

16:20.680 --> 16:22.751
Let us out of here!

16:22.840 --> 16:24.433
Come on.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.671
Why are we in
your secret prison?

16:26.760 --> 16:27.760
It's not a prison.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.271
It's a Tesla conductor tube
that dampens meta-powers.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.033
Okay, it's a prison.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.176
We just need
to convince everybody

16:34.200 --> 16:36.157
that we're not crazy!

16:36.240 --> 16:37.435
How?

16:37.520 --> 16:38.656
How do you suggest
that we do that?

16:38.680 --> 16:42.230
Because everyone on Earth
thinks that we're each other.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.274
- That's it.
- Hmm?

16:45.360 --> 16:47.192
Maybe it's just Earth-1
that's been affected.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.634
If we can get an extrapolator,

16:48.720 --> 16:50.313
breach to Earth-38
and find Kara.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.312
If she remembers us,
then maybe she can help

16:52.400 --> 16:53.550
fix whatever's happened.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.475
You skipped the part where
you explain how we escape.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.279
Were you able to get
in touch with ARGUS?

16:59.360 --> 17:01.238
Well, I tried, but I kept
getting interference

17:01.320 --> 17:03.039
at 650 nanometers.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.873
Isn't that the wavelength
for red light?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.673
Red light, exactly.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.512
And when I checked
the city's weather cams,

17:08.599 --> 17:09.670
this is what I found:

17:09.760 --> 17:11.273
red skies, yellow lightning.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.477
So you think Barry
and Oliver's shared psychosis

17:13.560 --> 17:15.756
is a result of weird weather?

17:15.839 --> 17:17.354
Stranger things, right?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.432
Okay, I'll run
their scans again.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.913
<i>You're best off giving up now.</i>

17:39.200 --> 17:41.237
Who the frak is that?

17:42.360 --> 17:46.070
I spent the past seven months
in a maximum security prison,

17:46.160 --> 17:49.517
and no matter how bad
things got... and they got bad...

17:49.600 --> 17:52.035
every cell had a toilet.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.310
You sure you can't hold it?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.439
Oh, you wanna back up
the pipes.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.520
And fry the dampener, yes.

17:59.521 --> 18:01.113
That's a good idea.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.336
One problem, I'm not gonna
be able to reach the valve

18:05.360 --> 18:06.396
with these on.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.576
You're gonna have
to dislocate your thumb.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
Are you crazy?
I'm...

18:08.680 --> 18:10.637
I'm not crazy. You need
to dislocate your thumb.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.000
Just apply pressure
to the joint.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.256
No, I'm gonna break my hand...

18:15.280 --> 18:16.336
You're not gonna
break your hand,

18:16.360 --> 18:17.840
because in this reality,

18:17.920 --> 18:20.389
your ligaments have been
stretched and conditioned

18:20.480 --> 18:22.711
in the art of escape
by Anatoly Knyazev.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.395
Now, man up, apply pressure
to the joint,

18:25.480 --> 18:27.551
and dislocate your thumb.

18:31.560 --> 18:32.994
- It worked.
- Yeah.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.560
All right.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.435
Okay, now just wait for it.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.113
Dampener's down.
Now what?

18:43.200 --> 18:44.576
You're gonna have to phase
us out of here.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.636
What?

18:45.720 --> 18:46.870
Phasing.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.077
That's when I vibrate
at the frequency of air,

18:49.160 --> 18:50.816
causing all the cells
in my body to get so excited

18:50.840 --> 18:52.433
I can pass through
solid objects.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.239
Right, "phasing."

18:59.320 --> 19:00.595
Want any advice?

19:00.680 --> 19:02.478
One second here,
Barry, please.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.313
I'm just saying,
it's not an easy move,

19:04.400 --> 19:05.675
<i>and if you screw this up</i>

19:05.760 --> 19:07.056
<i>then you're gonna come out
of the phase</i>

19:07.080 --> 19:08.120
halfway through the glass.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.310
What?

19:09.400 --> 19:11.153
Why are you laughing?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.799
I didn't realize...

19:12.920 --> 19:15.833
- Your thumb looks ridiculous.
- Oh, my God.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.231
I didn't realize
that's how mine looked.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.437
Well, look at that,
you did it.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.749
Great.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.399
Don't leave me, man.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.594
Figured it out.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.637
All right, let's go.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.473
Get the extrapolator
and get out of here.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.075
I can't let you do that,
Barry.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.959
Iris, please, I know
how weird this is,

19:43.040 --> 19:46.112
but somewhere inside, you know
we're telling the truth,

19:46.200 --> 19:48.317
that it's me, Barry.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.274
Do you remember
when I first moved in?

19:52.360 --> 19:56.036
Joe brought me to the house
after my mom was killed.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.318
I looked at you and I said,
"My dad didn't do it."

19:59.920 --> 20:02.594
- And then you said...
- "I believe you."

20:03.800 --> 20:05.393
You always did.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.517
And now I need you
to believe me again.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.118
Iris, you're my lightning rod.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.511
Quick, before
I change my mind.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.990
We'll fix this, I promise.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.594
<i>♪♪ Somebody save me ♪♪</i>

20:36.960 --> 20:40.590
<i>♪♪ Let your warm hands
break right through it ♪♪</i>

20:40.680 --> 20:44.515
<i>♪♪ Somebody save me ♪♪</i>

20:44.600 --> 20:46.432
I'm writing it.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.035
We've been over this, hon.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.316
No, you talked, I ignored.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.517
You need a new muffler.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.432
I think this is
a tie rod end.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.079
Come on, Kara,
back me up here.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.355
Uh, no, thanks.

20:58.440 --> 20:59.999
I know better than
to get involved

21:00.080 --> 21:01.878
in a debate with Lois Lane.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.553
But you do know the feeling,

21:03.640 --> 21:08.237
that itch, that fire
in the back of your head,

21:08.320 --> 21:11.199
the siren song of a story
that has to be written.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.191
Huh?

21:15.280 --> 21:17.351
Yeah, I do, I do.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.877
The world is gonna want
to know why Lois Lane

21:20.960 --> 21:22.952
went to Argo City
with Superman.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.759
Details, I'll make up
a reason.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.672
Oh, so much for truth
in journalism.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.558
Says the reporter
who writes about

21:28.680 --> 21:30.717
his own exploits as Superman.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.237
I was the first human
to set foot

21:34.320 --> 21:36.676
on what's left of Krypton,

21:36.760 --> 21:39.036
to lay eyes
on the Jewel Mountains,

21:39.120 --> 21:43.353
to endure the endless,
torturous deliberations

21:43.440 --> 21:44.476
of the High Council,

21:44.560 --> 21:45.914
<i>and I have to write about it.</i>

21:46.000 --> 21:48.276
One small step for Lois Lane,

21:48.360 --> 21:52.320
one giant leap
for Lois Lane's career.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.074
Says the woman who is already
the most famous, feared,

21:55.160 --> 21:57.356
and intrepid reporter
on two planets.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.911
And yet someone on this farm

22:01.000 --> 22:06.155
is still making 21 cents
on the dollar more than me.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.152
And it ain't Kara, honey.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.239
You two catch up.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.757
I am gonna go slam
some small things really hard.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.280
Okay, just be careful
on that ladder.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.232
It's really old.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.158
You'll catch me.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.520
Break time, boss?

22:28.520 --> 22:30.955
I've never been challenged
like that before,

22:31.040 --> 22:32.110
just to my face:

22:32.200 --> 22:34.396
"Tell us who you are,
Supergirl."

22:34.480 --> 22:36.711
Well, except for Ms. Grant.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.016
Well, and I'm sure
it was harder

22:38.040 --> 22:40.111
when it's the president
doing the threatening.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.998
- Cat was scarier.
- Yeah.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.677
Do you think I did
the right thing?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.520
Our secret identities,
they protect the people we love

22:49.600 --> 22:51.193
<i>from being threatened
by our enemies.</i>

22:51.280 --> 22:53.400
There aren't a lot of things
more important than that.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.114
I'm just sad I have
to leave the DEO,

22:56.200 --> 23:00.080
and now Alex is there alone.
I feel like I let her down.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.755
Oh, and then I left you
to defend Earth alone

23:02.840 --> 23:04.069
so I could got to Argo.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.594
- Nah...
- I'm sorry.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.434
No, don't be sorry
about that. It's home.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.080
I'm really glad you
got to see it finally,

23:11.200 --> 23:12.714
connect with it.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.473
It was more than
just connecting

23:14.560 --> 23:15.755
with our culture, you know?

23:17.280 --> 23:18.919
<i>I'm okay.</i>

23:20.400 --> 23:21.675
You know, it was Lois.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.355
<i>Everything new that
I experienced on Argo,</i>

23:24.440 --> 23:26.079
she was experiencing it too.

23:26.160 --> 23:30.916
You know, out there we were...
we were both strange visitors.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.991
I must sound so selfish.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.640
No, love is the most
unselfish thing in the world...

23:38.800 --> 23:39.800
On any world.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.678
Well, about that.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.197
There's something that I've
needed to talk to you about.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.674
Okay.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.080
Wait, wait, wait.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.256
- Who are you?
- We come in peace.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.714
Whoa, Lois, wait, wait.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.757
This is Barry and Oliver.
They're friends.

23:56.840 --> 23:57.840
Wait.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.196
So you know that I'm Oliver
and he's Barry?

24:00.280 --> 24:02.511
Yeah, w... why wouldn't I?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.353
Oh, man.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.440
Okay.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.637
Um, you guys, this is
my cousin Clark.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.120
<i>I'm so glad you get to meet.</i>

24:09.200 --> 24:10.873
Your cousin.
That cousin?

24:10.960 --> 24:12.155
The super cousin?

24:12.240 --> 24:13.993
Oh, please, call me Clark.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.231
Uh, welcome to our farm.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.356
Cool.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.193
Are you puffing out your chest?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.396
Yes.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.273
Lois Lane, <i>Daily Planet.</i>

24:22.360 --> 24:24.716
Wait, why did you guys think
I wouldn't recognize you?

24:24.800 --> 24:26.757
- Well...
- Oh, uh...

24:28.320 --> 24:30.960
Oh.
Well, that's new.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.633
We could use your help.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.152
<i>All units to Waid
and Augustyn.</i>

24:36.240 --> 24:38.311
Something's destroying
IVO Labs.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.520
He has our powers.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.159
Again.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.670
Okay, come on, man.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.800
I mean, I've been shooting
paint cans all afternoon.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.112
Unless... unless a paint can
rewrote reality

25:19.200 --> 25:20.953
- and made us swap lives...
- I get it.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.072
Then you need actual
combat training, Barry.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.216
All right, fine.
You know what?

25:24.240 --> 25:26.311
Why don't you go over there,
run at me,

25:26.400 --> 25:28.392
and I'll try and hit you
with an arrow.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.193
Right, okay.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.590
Where did you bury
the remote control bows?

25:33.680 --> 25:35.399
Dude.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.711
Come on, I'm not you.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.792
Yeah, well, okay.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.154
Ready!

25:46.280 --> 25:47.839
Here we go.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.273
Nice try.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.959
Ow.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.875
Oh, I've been waiting
four years for that, man.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.599
Oh, it's priceless.
Hold on.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.680
Need to get a photo.

26:00.681 --> 26:02.000
- What?
- Boom.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.713
I got it, don't worry.
Hold on a second.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.595
That's great.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.830
You think this is funny?

26:08.960 --> 26:10.713
Do you think my skills
are a joke?

26:10.800 --> 26:11.836
Come on, man.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.798
I was a much better sport
when you shot me.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.918
I shot you to teach you
how to case an environment.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.320
You shot me to get a laugh.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.720
- All right.
- You know what?

26:19.800 --> 26:22.679
Fine, fine.
Come at me.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.752
Try to get... try to get
one hit in.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.797
Deck him, Barry!

26:28.360 --> 26:29.680
What?
He's a jerk.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.479
I'm not doing this.
This isn't how I train.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.756
Oh, you train?
Really?

26:33.840 --> 26:36.150
I thought your powers
just dropped out of the sky.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.336
If you're trying to get
a rise out of me,

26:37.360 --> 26:38.360
it's not gonna work.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.595
Need a peanut gallery?

26:39.680 --> 26:41.456
Can you not do anything
without your wife in your ear?

26:41.480 --> 26:42.480
Are you serious, man?

26:42.560 --> 26:44.279
Felicity invented
quarterbacking.

26:44.360 --> 26:47.273
I don't think that you can
go more than nine hours

26:47.360 --> 26:49.636
without some sappy
motivational speech.

26:49.720 --> 26:50.720
I'm not doing this.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.870
Your team betrayed you.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.838
You needed them,
and they weren't there.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.320
I'm not doing this.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.000
You know, if you really knew
how to use my speed,

27:03.080 --> 27:04.640
I never could have laid
a finger on you.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.280
<i>That's the guy who
attacked us at Ivo Laboratories,</i>

27:09.320 --> 27:11.437
Anti-Meta-human
Adaptive Zootomic Organism.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.354
A-M-A-Z-O, "AMAZO."

27:14.440 --> 27:16.511
Sometimes these things
just fall into your lap.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.831
It says Ivo Labs
was contracted by ARGUS

27:18.920 --> 27:21.116
to build a unit capable
of identifying meta-powers.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.675
But he doesn't just scan powers.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.037
He's pumping a nano-adaptive
hybrid of the Mirakuru serum.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.520
So that's how
he stole our powers.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.478
He scanned
our meta-human genes,

27:30.560 --> 27:33.200
then used the Mirakuru hybrid
to copy them.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.397
So an evil copycat Gort

27:35.480 --> 27:38.120
is coming to klaatu barada
kick-to our asses,

27:38.200 --> 27:41.113
and we can't let out Flash
and Green Arrow to fight it?

27:41.200 --> 27:44.716
Well, we could
if they were still here.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.679
Why don't you tell them,
Iris West-Allen, what happened.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.319
Hurry.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.515
You let them out?

27:52.320 --> 27:54.994
Okay, look, I know what
you're thinking.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.959
But I spoke to Oliver,
or whoever he is,

27:58.040 --> 28:00.430
and I could feel something.

28:00.520 --> 28:04.514
Guys, I felt like I was
really talking to Barry.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.478
I believe you.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.559
It is weird out there.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.718
These red skies,
Barry and Oliver... that,

28:18.840 --> 28:21.400
<i>and I vibed somebody
in the Speed Lab.</i>

28:21.480 --> 28:22.516
- What?
- Yeah.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.478
Some guy with ridges
on his head,

28:24.560 --> 28:25.994
these big muttonchops.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.390
Do you think that
the red skies, this guy,

28:28.480 --> 28:32.156
these disparate events
are somehow connected?

28:32.240 --> 28:34.152
So Barry and Oliver
were mind-swapped

28:34.240 --> 28:37.039
by a guy with muttonchops?

28:37.120 --> 28:40.033
Man, it's not even Tuesday.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.356
<i>It's AMAZO.</i>

28:43.440 --> 28:45.238
He just entered city limits.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.033
Don't tell me
you came to say sorry.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.600
I try to avoid
saying that word.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.875
Look, man, I get it.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.794
You were just trying to help
in your own Oliver way,

29:16.880 --> 29:18.109
<i>trying to get
a rise out of me</i>

29:18.200 --> 29:20.317
<i>so I'd fight like you.</i>

29:20.400 --> 29:22.869
Yeah, it's more than that,
Barry.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.191
I've been doing this
for a very long time.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.159
And nearly every time
that I learn a lesson,

29:28.240 --> 29:30.516
it comes with a painful memory.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.396
Watched friends die.
I've had to kill to survive.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.840
When I'm the Green Arrow,

29:37.960 --> 29:40.156
I channel those
painful memories.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.233
I... I draw on a darkness

29:43.320 --> 29:44.913
every time I draw back
my bow.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.151
So to see you
with all of my abilities,

29:47.240 --> 29:48.799
just laughing
and joking around,

29:48.880 --> 29:50.678
it pissed me off,

29:51.440 --> 29:54.274
more than I would
care to admit.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.319
Whenever I run,
whatever I'm feeling inside,

29:57.440 --> 30:00.239
grief, guilt,
I've gotta just let it go

30:00.360 --> 30:02.079
and focus on whatever
I'm running toward:

30:02.160 --> 30:05.039
Iris, my friends,
all the joy in my life.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.715
<i>When I'm happy, I run faster,</i>

30:08.480 --> 30:10.358
just like when
you phased earlier.

30:11.360 --> 30:13.079
You were having a good time.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.750
You couldn't dislocate
your thumb until you got angry.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.792
If you're gonna be
the Green Arrow

30:20.920 --> 30:22.559
and I'm gonna be the Flash...

30:22.640 --> 30:25.075
Maybe we need to start
acting more like each other.

30:25.880 --> 30:29.032
Yes, finally, God.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.797
Super hearing, sorry.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.314
But I've been sitting in there

30:34.400 --> 30:35.856
waiting for you guys
to figure this out

30:35.880 --> 30:37.633
because I have
a lot of thoughts, okay?

30:37.720 --> 30:38.720
I should smile more.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.473
Yeah, maybe you should.
It might help.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.756
You guys have to act the parts.

30:42.840 --> 30:43.876
Come on, try it.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.110
What?

30:45.200 --> 30:47.112
I'm the Green Arrow.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.600
Wear a mask.

30:50.680 --> 30:51.776
Sound like that... I don't...

30:54.240 --> 30:55.356
Cisco?

30:55.440 --> 30:59.878
Hey, Supergirl, Barry...

31:00.000 --> 31:01.912
Oliver.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.150
You believe us now?

31:03.240 --> 31:05.596
Yeah, we all do.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.149
Sorry we locked you up.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.118
But if you feel like
forgiving us

31:10.200 --> 31:11.316
and coming back to Earth-1,

31:11.400 --> 31:13.357
we've got a little bit
of a sitch back home,

31:13.440 --> 31:15.033
like a please,
for the love of God,

31:15.120 --> 31:17.077
there's a killer robot
destroying the city

31:17.160 --> 31:18.355
kind of sitch.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.033
We could use some help.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.394
- Let's do it.
- You wanna tag along?

31:24.480 --> 31:26.199
If you don't, I will,
Smallville.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.710
Cool.
Who are you?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.153
A friend.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.080
Where the hell is Cisco?

31:46.160 --> 31:47.480
I'm right here.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.960
And I brought the big guns.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.710
What are they doing?

32:10.800 --> 32:11.856
Trying to keep AMAZO
off balance

32:11.880 --> 32:13.760
before it has time
to replicate their abilities.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.109
Finish him.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.954
<i>No sign of movement.</i>

32:33.040 --> 32:34.474
Nice work.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.632
We got lucky.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.551
Uh, guys, you might want
to get out of the way.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.800
What the hell is he doing?

33:01.880 --> 33:04.520
Exactly what we wanted
to avoid.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.715
Well, that's not great.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.712
AMAZO copied
all of their powers,

33:20.800 --> 33:22.439
and now it's
on the hunt for more.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.313
Cisco, there's got
to be something

33:24.400 --> 33:25.629
you can do to stop it.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.792
How do you stop a T-3000
that kills for breakfast?

33:28.880 --> 33:33.557
It's a computer, right?
So just turn it off.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.916
- I hate it when you're right.
- Well, I'm right.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.354
Let's go.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.717
- It can phase.
- That's what that's called?

33:40.800 --> 33:42.598
Well, we can't fight
what we can't hit.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.273
I've got an idea.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.360
Bring him back here.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.712
No problem.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.393
Move.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.552
When he comes back,
knock him down.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.640
He won't be able to phase
and run at the same time.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.056
<i>Guys, where are we at?</i>

34:54.080 --> 34:55.120
I think we got it.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.675
We reverse-engineered
AMAZO's operating system

34:57.760 --> 34:59.797
and whipped up a virus
to wipe his CPU.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.360
- Not so difficult.
- Except...

35:01.440 --> 35:03.750
Except it's a robot
that has replicated

35:03.840 --> 35:05.240
their super strengths,
and, thus,

35:05.320 --> 35:06.959
now it is impenetrable,
so you cannot put

35:07.080 --> 35:08.196
the virus inside it.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.280
<i>That's not great.</i>

35:09.320 --> 35:10.515
Okay, so what do we do?

35:10.600 --> 35:13.115
Look, if AMAZO inherited
all of their strengths,

35:13.200 --> 35:15.556
then maybe it inherited
their weaknesses too.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.336
<i>Only we're not gonna
weaken it, Iris.</i>

35:17.360 --> 35:18.800
We're gonna send it
straight to hell.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.998
<i>Oliver, you're gonna have to
counteract AMAZO's phasing</i>

35:24.080 --> 35:25.520
while Supergirl
and Superman hold it.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.136
<i>- Got it.</i>
- I'll only have one shot.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.117
<i>Now, bring me that virus,
Cisco.</i>

35:34.000 --> 35:35.116
Come here.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.554
Get ready.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.154
Done.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.040
Don't miss.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.839
I won't.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.560
Hurry up!

36:00.640 --> 36:05.590
AMAZO, you have
failed this city.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.877
AMAZO has been dismantled

36:43.960 --> 36:46.520
and every piece locked up
in a S.T.A.R. Labs vault

36:46.640 --> 36:48.472
except for this one.
This is my souvenir.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.796
A round of applause,
everybody.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.394
<i>Félicitation,</i> Flash.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.512
That's quite a performance
you did out there.

36:54.600 --> 36:58.071
Well, I appreciate that,
but still Oliver Queen.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.470
And I am still Barry Allen.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.880
I don't know, guys.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.111
You took down AMAZO
in one shot.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.879
Only the Green Arrow
can do that.

37:05.960 --> 37:09.590
And, Oliver, you outran AMAZO,
just like the Flash.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.456
Maybe we should stick
with this whole body swap thing

37:11.480 --> 37:12.596
for a while.

37:12.680 --> 37:13.680
<i>Seems to be working okay.</i>

37:13.760 --> 37:15.456
I don't know that anybody
would be too worried

37:15.480 --> 37:16.994
if you two don't switch back.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.576
We need to figure out who
did this to Barry and Oliver

37:19.600 --> 37:22.513
and why and then we're gonna
reverse it, okay?

37:22.600 --> 37:24.557
Caitlin, any thoughts?

37:24.640 --> 37:25.936
I haven't quite figured
it out yet,

37:25.960 --> 37:27.838
but until I do,
I am confident

37:27.920 --> 37:29.957
that Central City and Star City
are in good hands.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.599
Speaking of "in good hands,"

37:31.680 --> 37:34.275
I should probably get back
to Metropolis and Lois.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.829
If anything were to happen,
her entire world's unprotected.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.240
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.198
Thank you
for helping us, Clark.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.896
We couldn't have stopped
AMAZO without you.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.230
Oh, not so sure
about that.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.789
<i>Hello, uh, Clark.</i>

37:46.880 --> 37:48.360
Help a genius out, would you?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.432
Look, I want to give you
this check...

37:50.520 --> 37:53.399
I do this for free, the whole
helping humanity thing.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.392
Oh, you think that
I'm giving...

37:55.480 --> 37:56.755
no, no, not for that.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.638
This is a alimony check
for my third wife.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.837
She also live on Earth-38,

38:00.920 --> 38:04.277
and I might be a little bit
behind in the payment.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.829
If you could just do me
the favor...

38:06.920 --> 38:09.355
You want me to deliver this
to your ex-wife?

38:09.440 --> 38:11.079
To my ex-wife,
my third ex-wife.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.230
You're welcome.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.437
<i>You're welcome too.</i>

38:15.560 --> 38:17.233
It's super.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.118
Man, I can trust him, right?

38:26.880 --> 38:28.712
Are you okay?

38:31.920 --> 38:33.434
No.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.236
You did a great job
with AMAZO,

38:36.880 --> 38:38.837
but at what cost, Barry?

38:38.960 --> 38:40.713
What do you mean?

38:40.800 --> 38:43.634
Do you know why I let
you and Oliver go?

38:44.920 --> 38:46.957
It was because
of something that I felt.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.838
When I stopped looking
with my eyes

38:48.920 --> 38:51.116
and I started listening
with my heart,

38:51.200 --> 38:55.114
I realized that you,

38:55.200 --> 38:58.272
Barry Allen,
have always been

38:59.280 --> 39:01.840
and will always be
the man that I love.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.794
No matter what mask
I wear,

39:05.880 --> 39:08.554
I'll always show you
my true face.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.234
I need you to promise me
something, Barry.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.669
Promise me that when we
figure out who did this to you

39:17.760 --> 39:19.717
and when you get
your speed back

39:19.800 --> 39:23.999
and you're finally
back in my arms...

39:25.680 --> 39:27.672
That you'll come back to me.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.354
Of course I'll come back.

39:30.440 --> 39:33.672
Barry, I heard what you said

39:33.760 --> 39:35.991
right before
you took that shot.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.832
You're the Green Arrow now.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.990
But please don't become
Oliver Queen.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.359
I won't.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.069
I promise.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.157
<i>Barry, we need you
in the workshop.</i>

40:08.840 --> 40:11.275
So you think this person
you saw has something to do

40:11.360 --> 40:12.776
with what's happened
to Barry and Oliver?

40:12.800 --> 40:14.120
I mean, I saw him
right after

40:14.200 --> 40:15.793
these two swapped capes.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.736
You've been having trouble
with your vibes lately, right?

40:17.760 --> 40:19.592
- Maybe it's that?
- No.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.273
This was beyond me.

40:21.360 --> 40:24.592
It felt like something
important.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.358
We need to see it.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.510
Okay, hang on.

40:36.360 --> 40:40.354
My God, I can see everything.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.160
Fascinating.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.278
I wouldn't have thought
the men of this Earth

40:49.360 --> 40:51.511
had this capacity.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.718
But it won't avail you.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.111
None of you can stop
what's been set into motion.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.034
You're best off giving up now,

41:01.120 --> 41:04.591
because nothing you can do
can alter

41:04.680 --> 41:06.751
what's about to happen.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.954
Are you okay?

41:10.040 --> 41:12.271
No, not even close.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.359
<i>What did you see?</i>

41:22.080 --> 41:24.072
This.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.355
I don't recognize him.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.318
Doesn't matter.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.756
I know where to find him.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.349
So what's our next move?

41:35.440 --> 41:36.794
We're going to Gotham City.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.000
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
