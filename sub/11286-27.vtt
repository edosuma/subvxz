00:04.264 --> 00:06.498
Max, why are you digging
through Regine's stuff?

00:06.564 --> 00:10.131
I'm just making sure she's
not taking anything that's mine.

00:10.198 --> 00:12.998
I've left a lot of things
over here over the years.

00:13.064 --> 00:14.998
Crumbs maybe.

00:20.964 --> 00:23.464
Synclaire, tell me that's
not a cigarette in your mouth.

00:23.531 --> 00:27.098
No. It's a cigadont.

00:27.164 --> 00:29.164
It's for people who
are trying to quit.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.764
You don't smoke.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.331
Yeah, but I feel like
I could start at anytime.

00:37.364 --> 00:39.364
Khadijah, this is all
your fault.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.931
If it weren't for you,
Regine wouldn't be moving out

00:44.998 --> 00:48.264
and I wouldn't be suckin'
on plastic right now.

00:48.331 --> 00:50.831
Well, if you want somebody
to blame your nutsy cuckoo

00:50.898 --> 00:52.464
behavior on, it's Regine.

00:52.531 --> 00:54.764
She's the one that made
the decision of leavin'

00:54.831 --> 00:56.998
I'm not playin'
her game this time.

00:57.064 --> 01:00.164
Okay, well, everything
upstairs is packed up.

01:00.231 --> 01:03.238
So, Khadijah, what are we
gonna do about this couch?

01:03.304 --> 01:06.304
What you mean, what we gonna do?
I bought it at stake.

01:07.838 --> 01:11.438
Yes, dear. But I
had it reupholstered.

01:11.504 --> 01:15.104
So, what do you want?
The fabric?

01:15.171 --> 01:18.038
Hey, that's a great idea.
I'll make drapes.

01:18.104 --> 01:21.904
Well, I'm gettin' off on outta
here because I'm, I've not time.

stockin' up this week

toast and Khadijah's out of rye.

You don't sell this
by the slice, do you?

I can't help it. Whenever I

When Buddy was a puppy
he ran away.

03:09.951 --> 03:12.418
I was so upset
that I took a cigarette

03:12.484 --> 03:14.218
out of my mother's purse.

03:14.284 --> 03:16.584
Turns out, Buddy was
just at the groomer's

03:16.651 --> 03:18.251
but it was too late.

but I can't hold
my tongue no longer.

03:59.384 --> 04:02.824
Your hostility got my baby
experimentin' with tobacco

04:02.891 --> 04:04.824
this must stop.

Alright, Synclaire, if it'll
make you feel any better

04:10.324 --> 04:13.924
you can have the airbrush kitty

look, look.

All the good kitchen
stuff belong to Regine.

Now, we'll never know
what it does.

really no big deal. Alright?

nice. Don't want her to like it.

I don't wanna interview a new
roommate. I want Regine to stay.

06:52.404 --> 06:53.538
Why?

what Russell told you

07:33.278 --> 07:35.211
but basically we're
lookin' for a roommate

07:35.278 --> 07:37.244
who can pay
her rent on time

07:37.311 --> 07:41.078
and occasionally cook
a five course meal.

fats and sugars, carbohydrates

is hungry for cinder.

have to worry about bills

'cause I always pay on time.

you enough, you learn.

‐ Do you have bad credit?
‐ Uh‐ah, no, no, no.

My wages are only attached
for two more months.

we were looking for.

family already.

Don't she look like Khaliah Ali
without the mustache?

08:20.951 --> 08:23.884

are really hittin' it off, huh?

08:23.951 --> 08:27.018

Well, I'm Regine.

and a great roommate

What do you do?

08:40.083 --> 08:42.150
I'm from the Bronx
and I work.

Well, isn't she snappy.

08:50.151 --> 08:52.651
Well, it was nice
meetin' you. Smooches.

Ooh! Now I understand why
y'all gettin' rid of her.

Attitude!

09:02.158 --> 09:03.791
Did she say smooges?

09:06.991 --> 09:09.558
You know, Zina, Regine
may have her faults

09:09.624 --> 09:12.758
but nobody talks about her
like that, except for me.

about this dinner with Max

09:32.791 --> 09:35.458
and, uh, I'm just not sure
what to do, man.

09:35.524 --> 09:38.591
If you want my opinion,
I say dress casual.

09:39.758 --> 09:42.924
You have a tendency
to...overdress.

09:45.258 --> 09:48.691
I'm trying to decide whether
or not I should go at all.

09:48.758 --> 09:52.491
Oh, man. Put some wool socks on
those cold feet and get goin'.

09:53.224 --> 09:54.324
'Hold up, hold up.'

that I, Kyle Barker am afraid?

Call it what you will.

belong together.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.731
Everyone knows it
except for you two.

10:08.798 --> 10:11.198
Yeah, man, but Max
is only havin' me over

10:11.264 --> 10:13.298
because she thinks
I'm a hero.

10:13.364 --> 10:16.364
Well, you disarmed a man
that had a gun in her face

10:16.431 --> 10:19.231
I'm guessin' that qualifies.

10:19.298 --> 10:20.598
Yeah, truth be told

10:20.664 --> 10:23.098
I was just runnin' in
to get some Kaopectate.

10:24.364 --> 10:25.331
Yeah.

10:28.431 --> 10:30.931
When I ran in, I accidentally
knocked the guy over

10:30.998 --> 10:34.131
I didn't even know what was
goin' on until Max straddled me.

10:36.631 --> 10:38.164
So, instead of being a hero

10:38.231 --> 10:41.731
you just a klutz
with a trutz, huh?

10:41.798 --> 10:44.798
Hey, don't worry about it,
your secret's safe with me.

10:44.864 --> 10:46.731
Man, isn't it wrong
to take advantage?

10:46.798 --> 10:50.331
I mean, she's throwin' herself
all over me because of a lie.

10:50.398 --> 10:53.198
Oh, man, you didn't
seem to have that problem

10:53.264 --> 10:54.964
when she was all lickin'‐‐

10:55.031 --> 10:56.331
Hey, hey, hey.

10:58.164 --> 11:00.904
So, what are you sayin',
I should go through with this?

11:00.971 --> 11:02.238
Heck, yeah.

11:02.304 --> 11:03.904
Float on.

11:05.971 --> 11:08.204
If I'm gonna find out
if this is real

11:08.271 --> 11:10.504
between me and Max,
it can't happen like this.

11:10.571 --> 11:12.038
I'll gonna
tell her the truth.

Da, da, da. Ha!

who this is'

it. Thanks anyway. Bye.

Out of the eight possible
roommates we've interviewed

I only kinda like the biker
who's smokin' a joint.

11:54.662 --> 11:58.262

but I won't sit here and beg.

Hey, hey,
watch that corner.

Alright, Regine. What you got
in this box? Books?

No, no, that's the heavy box.
This is just sandals.

12:11.825 --> 12:14.825
Alright, Kyle, I don't know
who you think you are

12:14.892 --> 12:17.392
but I did not spend the whole
day cooking, cleaning

12:17.459 --> 12:19.192
and hanging pictures
for the first time

12:19.259 --> 12:21.992
so that you could cancel on me
at the last minute.

12:22.059 --> 12:23.092
‐ But‐‐
‐ But nothing.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.892
I've had enough of this
humility crap.

12:24.959 --> 12:28.525
You saved my life, and there is
such a thing as been gracious.

12:28.592 --> 12:29.692
‐ Max‐‐
‐ Max my ass.

12:29.759 --> 12:31.692
I've got a roast that's ready.

12:33.525 --> 12:36.525
A salad that's going to wilt,
and candles I plan to light.

12:36.592 --> 12:38.059
So you're coming to my house.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.859
I'm gonna stuff food down your
throat and you'll feel faint.

12:40.925 --> 12:43.059
Is that clear?

12:43.125 --> 12:45.359
Max, you seem to have
a lot of energy.

12:45.425 --> 12:47.359
Can you help us
with this box?

12:52.359 --> 12:55.825
My house.
6 o'clock sharp.

12:55.892 --> 12:59.459
Or from now on, our relationship
is going to become

12:59.525 --> 13:01.132
really unpleasant.

13:03.399 --> 13:04.932
[door closes]

13:10.465 --> 13:12.499
Yeah, right.
Like I'm scared of her.

13:12.565 --> 13:14.532
Like she gonna
tell me what to do.

13:14.599 --> 13:16.165
Please..

13:21.532 --> 13:22.865
I'm going.

13:25.899 --> 13:27.699
[knock on door]

13:38.565 --> 13:40.532
Six o'clock, on the dot.

13:40.599 --> 13:42.065
Well, I wouldn't
dare be late

13:42.132 --> 13:44.232
after such a gracious
invitation.

13:45.265 --> 13:46.799
Just shut up and come in.

13:48.299 --> 13:51.465
So, this is the palace
of Maximus, huh?

13:51.532 --> 13:54.965
Ha, I figure this is where
you trap them and..

13:55.032 --> 13:57.865
...that's where
you cage 'em, huh?

13:57.932 --> 14:01.572
Only by request. The rest are
released back into the water.

14:01.639 --> 14:04.372
Ah, so you have a piano.
I didn't know you play.

14:04.439 --> 14:05.739
I don't.

14:05.805 --> 14:08.039
It's a gift from McLay.
Well, not really.

14:08.105 --> 14:11.105
But, uh, when he gives me
the 1800 bucks he owes me

14:11.172 --> 14:12.772
he can have it back.

14:12.839 --> 14:14.805
[piano music]

14:23.405 --> 14:25.339
I see you don't
play either.

14:27.572 --> 14:30.039
‐ Let's see what you can do.
‐ Okay.

14:31.039 --> 14:32.405

14:32.472 --> 14:33.672
Liberace.

[off‐key piano music]

[chuckling]

14:38.772 --> 14:41.072
And not one lesson.

14:41.139 --> 14:44.139
I see nothin' but potential.
Come here, put your hand here.

15:04.912 --> 15:07.279
Ooh, yes, crab cakes!
Crab cakes.

15:08.979 --> 15:12.712
And this desk, that box,
and that plant.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.245
Well, that's it.

15:16.312 --> 15:19.579
‐ I guess this is it.
‐ Guess so.

15:19.645 --> 15:20.979
Bye, Regine.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.112
Stop her! This is your chance
to be the mature one.

15:25.179 --> 15:28.779
No, this is Regine's chance
to be the mature one.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.112
Look at her. She's just waiting
for you to ask her to stay.

15:32.179 --> 15:33.512
How can you tell?

15:33.579 --> 15:37.045
Because I'm looking
with my heart.

15:37.112 --> 15:39.045
Well, take you heart
to Lenscrafters

15:39.112 --> 15:41.479

seeing it.

‐ You wouldn't.

15:49.812 --> 15:52.245
[chuckling]
Oh, yeah.

15:52.312 --> 15:53.812
Soon as I find a match

15:53.879 --> 15:57.279
this place is gonna smell
like a bar in the east village.

15:57.345 --> 15:58.945
Okay, okay.

15:59.012 --> 16:02.385
Alright, I will talk
to her...for you.

16:02.452 --> 16:04.619
You are not a well‐woman.

16:07.352 --> 16:10.785
Look, um, Regine, how would you
react if someone were to say

16:10.852 --> 16:13.252
they were sorry,
and ask you to stay?

16:15.852 --> 16:17.785
I never really
thought about it.

16:17.852 --> 16:20.685
I guess I'll have to be
in that situation to know.

16:20.752 --> 16:23.385
So you might stay
if someone would ask?

16:25.019 --> 16:28.552
Honestly, I don't know.

16:28.619 --> 16:31.919
Okay, Regine, I will admit..

16:31.985 --> 16:35.419
when you told me you were moving
out, I didn't believe you.

16:35.485 --> 16:38.885
Well, look, don't do this
just to prove me wrong.

16:38.952 --> 16:42.952
I am really, really sorry.
I want you to stay.

16:44.952 --> 16:47.785
I know you really
mean that, Khadijah.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.152
Thanks.

16:50.752 --> 16:52.719
But I really think
we've outgrown each other.

16:52.785 --> 16:54.719
I need to do this for me.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.485
Unbelievable!

17:00.792 --> 17:02.059
You mean to tell me

17:02.125 --> 17:05.492
you get me to break down and
apologize, and you leave anyway?

17:05.559 --> 17:08.125
You are true to form
to the end. See ya.

17:11.392 --> 17:12.759
‐ Ciao.
‐ Bye.

17:14.192 --> 17:15.959
‐ X's and O's.
‐ Later.

17:16.025 --> 17:17.358
Ah, you..

17:26.759 --> 17:28.059
[sighs]

17:31.159 --> 17:33.192
I don't think
I've ever seen you carry

17:33.259 --> 17:36.359
a tray of food
that you were not eating.

17:36.425 --> 17:39.992
I don't think I've ever seen you
without losing my appetite.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.992
But here we are.

17:45.225 --> 17:46.959
‐ Thank you.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

17:48.825 --> 17:50.425
Um..

17:50.492 --> 17:53.292
Look, I'm not real good
with this gratitude thing.

17:53.359 --> 17:55.525
So, um, open it.

17:59.492 --> 18:00.899
Oh, wow.

18:00.965 --> 18:03.165
Max, this is beautiful.

18:03.232 --> 18:05.532
It belonged
to my grandfather.

18:05.599 --> 18:07.499
Now it's yours.

18:07.565 --> 18:09.565
You gave me more time.

18:09.632 --> 18:11.265
It keeps time.

18:11.999 --> 18:13.265
Ooh, that's corny.

18:13.332 --> 18:15.165
[laughing]

18:15.232 --> 18:17.299
But you know
what I'm saying.

18:17.365 --> 18:21.799
Um, I‐I don't know
what to say, Max, uh..

18:21.865 --> 18:24.499
‐ I can't except this.
‐ Yes, you can, dammit!

18:26.065 --> 18:28.365
Come on, why are you
making this so hard?

18:28.432 --> 18:30.632
Because it was an accident,
woman, alright?

18:30.699 --> 18:31.832
What?

18:31.899 --> 18:33.865
I didn't even know
the store's been robbed.

18:33.932 --> 18:35.532
I just bumped
into the guy.

18:35.599 --> 18:37.332
So I do not deserve
your gratitude

18:37.399 --> 18:40.832
or the watch,
or the crab cakes.

18:40.899 --> 18:43.699
So come on and insult me
in that special Max way.

18:46.332 --> 18:48.632
You know I'd love to.

18:48.699 --> 18:51.865
I'd really love to.
But I can't.

18:51.932 --> 18:54.599
Kyle, it doesn't matter
whether you did it by accident

18:54.665 --> 18:56.232
or on purpose.

18:56.299 --> 18:57.832
You saved my life.

18:57.899 --> 18:59.765
So, so, wait.
What are you saying?

18:59.832 --> 19:01.572
If some policeman
had disarmed that gunman

19:01.639 --> 19:04.139
he'd be standing here
right now instead of me?

19:04.205 --> 19:05.905
Maybe for drinks.

19:05.972 --> 19:08.872
But I would not have
defrosted the seafood.

19:11.272 --> 19:14.139
So then, this is more than
just a thank you?

19:16.972 --> 19:19.405
Oh, I don't know.
You know, look.

19:19.472 --> 19:22.005
When you called
and canceled..

19:22.072 --> 19:24.405
...I was upset.

19:24.472 --> 19:27.172
Like I'd been stood up
by a real date.

19:28.939 --> 19:33.572
Well, um, this kinda
feels like a real date.

19:33.639 --> 19:34.605
Yeah.

19:34.672 --> 19:35.739
[chuckling]

19:35.805 --> 19:37.972
Truth be told, I've..

19:38.039 --> 19:40.839
...been developing a sort of
sick curiosity about you.

19:40.905 --> 19:42.139
[laughs]

19:42.205 --> 19:44.639
Well, um, I must admit
to a certain

19:44.705 --> 19:47.705
perverse fascination
with your inner workings.

19:52.605 --> 19:55.139
‐ So what do we do now?
‐ Hey..

19:55.205 --> 19:58.139
This is your house.
I am just a guest.

20:08.879 --> 20:11.579
Nah! We can't, we can't.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.845
You know, things could
really get complicated.

20:14.912 --> 20:16.645
Yeah. We live to regret it.

20:16.712 --> 20:18.012
[laughs]

20:18.079 --> 20:20.645
Whoo! It would be the stupidest
thing we've ever done.

20:20.712 --> 20:23.512
But it's not like
we haven't done it before.

20:24.812 --> 20:27.179
[chuckling]

20:29.079 --> 20:32.712
Yeah, yeah. But, but
that was by circumstance.

20:32.779 --> 20:35.345
This time
it would be by choice.

20:39.579 --> 20:41.712
I've always been
pro‐choice.

20:44.645 --> 20:47.679
Well, it would be a shame
not to take advantage of that.

20:47.745 --> 20:48.945
A waste.

20:49.012 --> 20:50.212
[laughing]

20:50.279 --> 20:52.345
You know, Max, uh..

20:52.412 --> 20:55.145
You could get addicted..

20:55.212 --> 20:56.379
[laughing]

20:56.445 --> 20:57.745
Please..

20:57.812 --> 21:00.319
‐ You may never leave.
‐ You may be right.

21:00.385 --> 21:01.485
[chuckling]

21:01.552 --> 21:04.252
Oh, no! What the hell
are we doing?

21:04.319 --> 21:07.552
I don't know.
I'm following you.

21:07.619 --> 21:10.119
Come on, you're not
helping me here.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.485
Max.

21:11.552 --> 21:14.952
Tell me, what do you
want from me?

21:15.019 --> 21:16.919
I don't know.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.985
But look, alright.

21:19.052 --> 21:21.352
This is moving way too fast.

21:21.419 --> 21:24.152
‐ Let's just slow it down.
‐ Maybe you're right.

21:24.219 --> 21:27.019
Maybe we should take this
one step at a time.

21:27.885 --> 21:29.319
[sighs]

21:36.819 --> 21:38.885
Is this really
going to happen?

21:40.385 --> 21:42.252
It's been happenin'.

21:58.406 --> 21:59.906
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:59.973 --> 22:01.346
H‐how much for the Kools?

22:01.413 --> 22:03.079
‐ Three dollars.
‐ And Marlboros?

22:03.146 --> 22:04.913
‐ Three dollars.
‐ How much for the lights?

22:04.979 --> 22:06.346
‐ Three dollars.
‐ Oh, they're lights.

22:06.413 --> 22:07.879
They should be cheaper.

22:07.946 --> 22:09.279
[coughing]

22:09.346 --> 22:11.846
Are you gonna buy somethin'
or stand there suckin' air?

22:11.913 --> 22:13.113
Okay, okay, okay. Uh, uh..

22:13.179 --> 22:14.979
Chewing tobacco.
How much is chewing tobacco?

22:15.046 --> 22:16.479
‐ 'Synclaire!'
‐ Huh?

22:16.546 --> 22:19.846
Damn, it's a bust. We never
had this conversation. Shh!

22:19.913 --> 22:21.313
What, what, what..

22:22.746 --> 22:23.979
Woo‐hoo!
