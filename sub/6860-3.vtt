00:16.303 --> 00:18.806
Jedi form rebel alliance!

00:18.840 --> 00:20.938
Led by Anakin Skywalker,

00:21.058 --> 00:23.310
the Jedi have trained a band of rebels

00:23.345 --> 00:26.680
to fight the Separatists
on the planet Onderon.

00:26.715 --> 00:29.850
With the help of the Jedi,
the rebels escape capture

00:29.885 --> 00:33.321
and infiltrated the heavily
fortified city of Iziz.

00:33.355 --> 00:36.057
Now our heroes
have launched an armed campaign

00:36.091 --> 00:39.227
to subvert the Separatist
occupation of the planet.

00:39.261 --> 00:42.230
The Jedi Council
continue to observe and advise

00:42.264 --> 00:44.332
as the rebels strive to gain momentum

00:44.366 --> 00:46.501
against the Separatist forces.

00:46.536 --> 00:49.137
Despite the absence
of civilian casualties,

00:49.172 --> 00:50.806
public fear has ensued

00:50.840 --> 00:53.074
as reports
of the rebels' daring strikes

00:53.109 --> 00:55.410
circulate throughout the city.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:07.724 --> 01:09.625
Your identification failed.

01:09.693 --> 01:10.826
That's not possible.

01:10.860 --> 01:14.263
You are coming with us.

01:15.298 --> 01:16.265
Hey!

01:17.634 --> 01:19.968
- What's going on?
- No!

01:56.770 --> 01:59.172
The rebels are attacking again.

01:59.206 --> 02:02.476
That is the fifth time this rotation.

02:06.214 --> 02:09.449
That should give King Rash
something to think about.

02:09.484 --> 02:12.352
Huh, I'm sure
you've gotten his attention.

02:29.103 --> 02:34.508
Dendup has been summoned
and awaits your order, my lord.

02:34.542 --> 02:37.110
What about the terrorists?

02:37.145 --> 02:39.413
They've attacked
a checkpoint near the canal

02:39.447 --> 02:41.682
and two droid patrols,

02:41.716 --> 02:43.717
one in Malgan Market.

02:43.752 --> 02:45.686
If they think destroying a few droids

02:45.721 --> 02:50.324
is going to effect change,
they've run a fool's errand.

02:50.358 --> 02:52.226
One more thing, my lord.

02:52.260 --> 02:55.496
The royal carriage was ambushed

02:55.530 --> 02:57.765
soon after it left the residence.

02:57.799 --> 03:01.736
Hmm, an attempt on my life.

03:01.770 --> 03:03.670
It appears that way.

03:05.974 --> 03:08.475
Get my predecessor in here.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.754
You surprise me.

03:23.556 --> 03:26.124
Engaging with extremists
is beneath you.

03:26.159 --> 03:29.462
Do you really want
your crown back that badly?

03:31.398 --> 03:34.701
I only want freedom for my people.

03:35.769 --> 03:36.969
Hmm.

03:37.003 --> 03:39.638
Your supporters are responsible
for terrorist acts

03:39.673 --> 03:42.141
against the kingdom and our allies.

03:42.175 --> 03:44.076
I didn't know that.

03:44.111 --> 03:48.114
You've made it quite impossible
to stay informed of anything

03:48.149 --> 03:50.550
outside my prison chamber.

03:50.585 --> 03:54.621
Call off the attacks.

03:54.688 --> 03:57.757
I cannot call off
what I did not dictate.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.626
What you are up against

03:59.694 --> 04:02.129
is simply the will of the people.

04:02.163 --> 04:07.000
It's up to the king
to embrace, bend, or break it.

04:07.034 --> 04:09.836
And I am no longer the king.

04:09.870 --> 04:12.438
Stop the attacks,

04:12.473 --> 04:15.341
or you will atone with your life.

04:15.376 --> 04:18.911
It is you that must end the attacks

04:18.946 --> 04:22.081
by ending the droid occupation.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.031
Your success will not go unnoticed.

05:14.135 --> 05:18.037
I agree, but we need to be
mindful of public perception.

05:18.071 --> 05:20.106
What was your observation, Padawan?

05:20.140 --> 05:22.708
The people were fearful, Master.

05:22.742 --> 05:24.076
Indeed.

05:24.110 --> 05:26.178
Judging from the reactions
I saw today,

05:26.213 --> 05:29.482
I'm afraid they will mistake
your intentions.

05:29.516 --> 05:30.984
We need to do more damage.

05:31.018 --> 05:34.321
A few dozen broken-down droids
will do little to free Onderon.

05:34.355 --> 05:36.924
The people need to believe
we can succeed.

05:36.959 --> 05:39.360
Without their support,
our efforts are meaningless.

05:39.395 --> 05:41.530
If they're afraid,
they won't support us.

05:41.564 --> 05:43.932
We need to assure them
of our intentions.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.301
I don't understand.
Why are they afraid?

05:46.335 --> 05:48.970
They're afraid
we're not strong enough to win.

05:49.005 --> 05:51.005
We need to earn their trust.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.809
You'll have plenty of time
to earn their trust.

05:53.843 --> 05:55.644
All of you are going to be very busy.

05:55.678 --> 05:57.979
Today was only a taste.

05:58.014 --> 05:59.847
You'll get your chance.

06:01.484 --> 06:04.553
In the meantime,
make the most of your victories.

06:04.587 --> 06:07.022
Welcome and learn from them.

06:07.056 --> 06:09.525
Perhaps if we hit something big,

06:09.559 --> 06:11.493
gave a show of strength,

06:11.528 --> 06:13.795
they will overcome their fear
and join us.

06:13.830 --> 06:15.797
Do you have something in mind?

06:15.832 --> 06:19.068
I know the perfect target.

06:21.939 --> 06:24.874
I think they're ready to give
the 501 some competition.

06:24.908 --> 06:27.276
Let's not get carried away, General,

06:27.310 --> 06:29.712
though these rebels have impressed me.

06:29.746 --> 06:32.447
We will share the developments
with the Jedi Council.

06:32.481 --> 06:35.383
Ahsoka will remain here as an advisor.

06:35.418 --> 06:38.987
Monitor them and report back
with their progress.

06:39.054 --> 06:40.688
Are you up for it, Snips?

06:40.723 --> 06:43.324
Or would you like
to return to Coruscant?

06:43.358 --> 06:45.493
No, Master.

06:45.527 --> 06:46.827
I want to stay.

06:46.862 --> 06:48.162
Good.

06:48.197 --> 06:50.231
We should continue
to provide supplies and credits,

06:50.265 --> 06:53.267
but they must learn
to operate on their own.

06:53.302 --> 06:55.436
Their survival depends on it.

06:55.471 --> 06:57.305
Yes, Master.

06:57.339 --> 06:59.340
Remember your purpose.

07:26.220 --> 07:30.123
This power generator feeds
substations across the city.

07:30.157 --> 07:33.493
We hit that, the entire grid falls.

07:33.528 --> 07:35.095
How does that help us?

07:35.129 --> 07:37.831
Battle droids are no longer
linked to central control.

07:37.865 --> 07:39.700
They operate individually.

07:39.734 --> 07:42.536
Yes, but they still need power
to recharge.

07:42.570 --> 07:44.171
If we take out this facility,

07:44.205 --> 07:46.006
it will knock out the power grid,

07:46.041 --> 07:47.641
and then it will only be
a matter of time

07:47.676 --> 07:50.178
until the droid army
is brought to a standstill,

07:50.212 --> 07:51.346
literally.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.147
If you carry the plan out
by nightfall,

07:53.182 --> 07:55.883
you'll maximize
your strike capability.

07:55.918 --> 07:57.452
Okay, so we just need to figure out

07:57.519 --> 07:59.787
how to destroy the power station.

07:59.821 --> 08:02.924
We need to do more surveillance.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.126
Those droids should have
all the intel we need

08:05.160 --> 08:07.428
stored up in those tin cans
of theirs, right?

08:07.462 --> 08:08.729
They should.

08:08.797 --> 08:11.331
Then I'll get us one.

08:33.253 --> 08:34.787
Hey, clanker.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.894
Uh-oh.

08:51.206 --> 08:52.973
Sentries at every access point,

08:53.007 --> 08:54.742
inside and out.

08:54.776 --> 08:57.845
We can't sustain combat
against their numbers.

08:57.879 --> 09:01.782
But our size makes us perfect
for mobility and surprise.

09:01.817 --> 09:04.118
We need something with heavy firepower

09:04.152 --> 09:06.487
if we are to blow up this facility.

09:06.521 --> 09:08.322
If we give them enough trouble,

09:08.357 --> 09:10.624
they'll call for reinforcements.

09:10.659 --> 09:11.959
Like a tank.

09:11.993 --> 09:13.193
Exactly.

09:13.228 --> 09:16.263
Then you can provide cover
while we hijack it.

09:16.297 --> 09:19.500
And then we use
their own weapon against them.

09:19.534 --> 09:23.104
And we bring the droid army
to its knees.

09:33.516 --> 09:34.549
Shh.

09:50.165 --> 09:51.799
Remember the plan.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.034
We attack this patrol,

09:53.069 --> 09:55.871
and hopefully they will
call in a tank for backup.

10:19.364 --> 10:20.364
Ah!

10:20.398 --> 10:21.431
Let's go.

10:33.277 --> 10:35.578
Patrol 118 to central.

10:37.413 --> 10:38.981
We've been ambushed by terrorists

10:39.015 --> 10:40.882
and need reinforcements.

10:41.951 --> 10:44.085
Let's hope they send a tank.

10:46.989 --> 10:48.090
Hear that?

10:48.157 --> 10:49.358
They've sent destroyers.

10:49.392 --> 10:50.426
Move!

11:07.341 --> 11:09.809
We're not gonna last unless
we take out those destroyers.

11:09.844 --> 11:11.311
We have to get behind them.

11:11.345 --> 11:12.345
Let's go.

11:34.701 --> 11:36.535
Roll it slow so it gets through.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.636
I know that.

11:39.606 --> 11:40.706
Nice job.

11:40.740 --> 11:42.073
You screwed me up.

12:01.727 --> 12:03.160
Thanks.

12:05.865 --> 12:08.600
I've never seen a destroyer
taken out that way before.

12:08.634 --> 12:10.168
We all have to adapt.

12:15.175 --> 12:17.176
There's our tank.

12:19.446 --> 12:20.647
Split up.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.514
Let's move.

13:24.981 --> 13:26.281
Good work.

13:26.315 --> 13:28.416
Now, let's get this thing
up and running again.

13:42.698 --> 13:44.599
What are you waiting for?

13:44.633 --> 13:45.967
Give me a second.

13:46.002 --> 13:47.335
Do you know what you're doing?

13:47.370 --> 13:50.839
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.474
You boys having a problem?

13:52.508 --> 13:54.542
No. No problem. Why?

13:54.577 --> 13:56.644
Well, come on.
We need to get moving.

13:56.679 --> 13:58.479
Hey, who put you in charge?

13:58.514 --> 13:59.547
All right.

13:59.581 --> 14:01.282
Get out of the tank, hotshot.

14:01.316 --> 14:03.350
This needs a woman's touch.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.485
Fine. Be my guest.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.287
We need to get to that power generator

14:07.321 --> 14:09.622
before they realize
this tank's gone missing.

14:09.656 --> 14:11.724
We're running out of time.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.860
I was gonna do that.

14:14.894 --> 14:17.096
Uh-huh. Sure.

14:20.700 --> 14:23.536
Couldn't have done it better myself.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.338
Now, that's the truth.

14:50.474 --> 14:51.707
I'll draw their fire.

14:51.742 --> 14:52.742
Good luck.

14:52.776 --> 14:53.810
Good luck.

14:53.844 --> 14:54.811
I'll cover you.

15:17.769 --> 15:19.037
We're almost in position.

15:19.071 --> 15:20.572
Ready when you are, Steela.

15:25.178 --> 15:27.145
A sniper. Get her.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.980
Roger, roger.

15:53.906 --> 15:56.107
Look.
We have reinforcements.

15:58.010 --> 15:59.677
Hey, you're not a droid.

15:59.712 --> 16:01.412
Get down from there.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.800
Fire the gun.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.401
The gun is recharging.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.980
You're all clear.

16:58.870 --> 17:01.739
Looks like all that training
is paying off.

17:07.679 --> 17:12.550
My lord, without power,
the droids will be massacred.

17:12.584 --> 17:16.453
This loss will work for us.

17:30.869 --> 17:32.570
There's been a power outage.

17:32.604 --> 17:34.439
I've lost contact with command.

17:34.473 --> 17:36.908
Switch to infrared.

17:36.942 --> 17:38.309
Aah!

17:41.413 --> 17:42.914
- It's the rebels.
- Fight for Onderon!

17:42.948 --> 17:44.215
They're destroying the droids!

17:44.250 --> 17:46.952
- Free Onderon!
- Freedom!

17:46.986 --> 17:48.186
Fight for freedom!

17:48.220 --> 17:49.554
Get the droids!

17:49.588 --> 17:51.222
Freedom!
Freedom!

18:04.268 --> 18:06.236
For freedom!
For Onderon!

18:12.610 --> 18:13.643
- Yeah!
- Yes!

18:13.677 --> 18:15.411
For freedom!
For Onderon!

18:24.054 --> 18:26.155
Show those droids what we're worth.

18:26.223 --> 18:27.824
We must celebrate.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.392
With pleasure.

18:33.864 --> 18:37.500
Come here, you handsome senator.

18:42.239 --> 18:43.840
Steela is a born leader.

18:43.874 --> 18:46.309
And quite courageous, I hear.

18:48.112 --> 18:50.346
Ahsoka, remember what I told you

18:50.380 --> 18:52.148
about staying focused.

18:52.182 --> 18:54.049
I can't help it, Master.

18:54.084 --> 18:55.317
I understand.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.651
You do?

18:56.686 --> 18:57.652
I do.

18:57.687 --> 18:59.154
But try to remember,

18:59.188 --> 19:01.823
always put purpose
ahead of your feelings.

19:01.857 --> 19:03.124
This latest development

19:03.158 --> 19:05.526
will surely get
Count Dooku's attention.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.928
He will respond harshly.

19:07.963 --> 19:10.097
They will stop at nothing to find you.

19:10.131 --> 19:12.499
You must adapt
and continue to confront them

19:12.533 --> 19:14.301
in order to liberate Onderon.

19:14.335 --> 19:15.302
We will.

19:15.336 --> 19:16.770
And we shall win.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.872
In that, I have no doubt.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.174
Now you must rally the people.

19:21.209 --> 19:23.176
You will need their support.

19:23.210 --> 19:24.677
Your ability to influence them

19:24.712 --> 19:28.448
will also determine
your capacity to represent them

19:28.482 --> 19:30.483
not only on the battlefield
but off of it

19:30.517 --> 19:33.954
against your enemies,
even within your own ranks.

19:33.988 --> 19:36.256
Your commitment will inspire others.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.725
Your conviction will lead to victory.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.060
After tonight's efforts,

19:40.095 --> 19:41.796
the people will be ready to follow.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.833
You will need a leader
for them to rally behind.

19:48.304 --> 19:51.474
They are waging a very public war.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.644
Every trespass is an embarrassment.

19:56.080 --> 20:00.484
Your forces cannot manage
a small band of terrorists?

20:00.518 --> 20:03.820
My lord, your droids
have become ineffective

20:03.855 --> 20:06.157
against the mounting rebel attacks.

20:06.191 --> 20:08.993
I thought I could trust you
to rule Onderon.

20:09.027 --> 20:13.030
I find this report most disappointing.

20:15.433 --> 20:19.035
It seems that the rebels
are far more organized

20:19.069 --> 20:20.803
than they were in the past.

20:20.838 --> 20:23.773
The attack against the power
generators proves that.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.775
Perhaps it's time you send me
better reinforcements

20:26.810 --> 20:28.577
than the droids I have.

20:28.611 --> 20:30.946
I will grant you this request

20:30.980 --> 20:33.615
and not only send you better droids

20:33.650 --> 20:35.584
but a better general.

20:35.619 --> 20:37.286
This is Kalani.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.757
I assure you he will succeed
where you have failed.

20:45.261 --> 20:47.496
We need to build on our momentum

20:47.530 --> 20:50.532
and continue our attacks
to keep them off balance.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.702
We have to assure the people first.

20:52.736 --> 20:54.470
If we keep disrupting their lives,

20:54.504 --> 20:56.372
we risk alienating them.

20:56.407 --> 20:58.775
We have to gain their trust.

20:58.809 --> 21:00.477
I agree with both of you.

21:00.511 --> 21:02.345
We can balance both.

21:02.380 --> 21:05.482
We also need to recruit others
to join us.

21:05.517 --> 21:07.385
Onderon is ours.

21:07.419 --> 21:09.120
We will remind everyone

21:09.154 --> 21:10.721
and keep reminding them

21:10.756 --> 21:12.390
until we get it back.

21:12.424 --> 21:13.991
- Onderon is ours!
- Onderon is ours!

21:14.025 --> 21:16.160
- Free Onderon!
- Onderon!

21:16.227 --> 21:17.794
For Freedom!

21:21.766 --> 21:24.968
All in favor of Steela as our leader,

21:25.002 --> 21:27.403
raise your hand.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.308
Okay.

21:32.342 --> 21:33.709
Looks like it's been decided.

21:33.744 --> 21:35.511
You're the leader.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.948
Saw.

21:38.982 --> 21:40.049
Let him go.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.517
He just needs to blow off some steam.

21:41.551 --> 21:42.518
He'll be back.

21:42.552 --> 21:46.121
I can't.

21:46.156 --> 21:48.023
Why?

21:48.058 --> 21:49.959
He's my brother.

21:50.584 --> 21:59.468
