03:23.953 --> 03:25.538
Hide.

03:25.913 --> 03:27.957
Hide.

03:49.603 --> 03:52.647
What did he mean, "hide"?

03:53.815 --> 03:58.861
- It must have been the sun.
- The sun didn't tie his hands.

05:27.405 --> 05:29.449
Chico!

05:54.348 --> 05:55.974
No, Chico. No.

05:59.269 --> 06:01.313
No.

06:16.870 --> 06:19.831
Drive them into the square.

07:54.089 --> 07:56.341
Ole!

07:56.632 --> 07:59.886
Ole! Ole!

08:23.450 --> 08:26.536
Ole! Ole!

09:19.795 --> 09:21.631
- Hello, Chris.
- Vin.

09:21.755 --> 09:24.467
Thought you took a job
ridin' shotgun for Overland.

09:24.592 --> 09:27.386
- I quit.
- How come?

09:28.179 --> 09:30.473
My health.

09:30.931 --> 09:34.101
Doctor said to find a climate
with less lead in the air.

09:34.226 --> 09:36.770
What are you doing here?

09:36.895 --> 09:40.107
Tracked a man across the line for bounty.

09:40.232 --> 09:42.984
- Who?
- Ole!

09:45.529 --> 09:47.947
You.

09:52.119 --> 09:55.038
Well, ain't you gonna ask?

09:55.163 --> 09:57.540
- What?
- Why I'm after ya.

09:57.666 --> 10:00.334
You just told me. Bounty.

10:01.377 --> 10:03.963
Hell, Chris, you think
I'd do a thing like that?

10:04.088 --> 10:06.841
I came so you'd know
there was a price on your head.

10:06.966 --> 10:09.176
How much?

10:09.302 --> 10:11.387
- Five hundred.
- Dollars?

10:13.264 --> 10:15.308
Pesos.

10:18.269 --> 10:22.690
Hell, it's enough some shypoke might
throw down on you while you're asleep.

10:22.815 --> 10:25.483
Maybe I oughta ride with ya,
in case you need any help.

10:25.609 --> 10:29.321
- Wouldn't want to put you to any trouble.
- No trouble.

10:30.572 --> 10:32.908
No trouble at all.

10:37.746 --> 10:39.790
Bravo!

11:12.780 --> 11:15.157
Hell,...

11:15.282 --> 11:17.534
.. let him fight.

11:17.659 --> 11:20.996
- I'll pay for the bull.
- ? Ypagaras el entierro?

11:21.121 --> 11:24.625
He wants to know
if you'll pay for the funeraI, too.

11:56.155 --> 11:58.198
Ole!

11:58.323 --> 12:00.367
Ole!

12:03.537 --> 12:04.955
Aha! Aha!

14:15.164 --> 14:17.458
Friend of yours?

15:09.382 --> 15:11.426
Petra.

15:14.304 --> 15:18.474
- I prayed you'd be here.
- What is it, Petra? What happened?

15:19.142 --> 15:23.354
Two days ago, many men with guns
rode into our village.

15:23.479 --> 15:27.316
Chico tried to fight them. It was no use.

15:27.442 --> 15:31.070
All the men they did not kill,
they drove into the square...

15:31.195 --> 15:33.698
.. and took them off into the desert.

15:33.822 --> 15:37.367
Coming here,
we passed through two villages,...

15:38.035 --> 15:40.329
.. both of them empty of men.

15:40.454 --> 15:43.207
Only women, crying over their dead.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.959
You say many men with guns.

15:46.085 --> 15:49.754
- How many?
- I don't know. Fifty, maybe more.

15:50.421 --> 15:54.467
They didn't say anything?
Where they were taking them? Why?

15:54.593 --> 15:57.220
- Nothing.
- What do you make of it, Chris?

15:58.304 --> 16:01.433
- I don't know.
- We can't fight a whole army of 'em.

16:01.557 --> 16:03.768
Chico would, if it was
the other way round.

16:03.893 --> 16:05.937
Chico's a fooI.

16:06.062 --> 16:08.189
Because he laid his gun aside,...

16:08.314 --> 16:11.484
.. married Petra,
tried to amount to something?

16:12.109 --> 16:14.571
? Vamos esta noche, senor, o manana?

16:16.280 --> 16:18.324
What did he say?

16:18.449 --> 16:23.079
He wants to know if we are going
after them tonight, or in the morning.

16:26.582 --> 16:29.835
It's a big country.
Findin' 'em could take a long time.

16:30.627 --> 16:34.506
Hell, I haven't been
going anywhere for ten years.

16:34.631 --> 16:37.175
Either have you.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.970
Ain't it the truth.

16:40.094 --> 16:42.388
Take them to my room.
They can sleep there.

16:42.514 --> 16:44.724
- Where are you headin'?
- To get help.

16:44.849 --> 16:49.020
- Findin' men ain't gonna be easy.
- Depends where you look.

17:19.132 --> 17:22.135
- What about this one?
- He stole a pig, senor.

17:23.595 --> 17:25.763
- A pig?
- Yes.

17:25.887 --> 17:28.349
I can let you have him very cheap.

17:37.066 --> 17:40.361
- This one?
- He caught his wife with another man.

17:42.489 --> 17:44.531
Both of them.

17:50.871 --> 17:53.707
This one is worth many pesos, senor.

17:53.832 --> 17:56.836
- But if I were you...
- Open it.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.505
- Senor...
- Open.

18:21.859 --> 18:23.903
Hello, Frank.

18:24.029 --> 18:26.071
Chris.

18:26.197 --> 18:30.201
- Haven't seen you around.
- Haven't been around. Been in here.

18:30.993 --> 18:33.662
He killed four men in a gunfight.

18:36.290 --> 18:40.252
- That's a fact.
- How would you like to get out?

18:40.378 --> 18:43.130
- I'm listenin'.
- Friend of mine's in trouble.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.007
- How much trouble?
- About as much as you are.

18:46.967 --> 18:50.887
- How many guns you up against?
- Fifty... Maybe more.

18:51.512 --> 18:53.974
Anybody on your side?

19:02.440 --> 19:04.650
How much?

19:04.776 --> 19:07.320
The risk is very great, senor.

19:07.445 --> 19:09.572
A hundred pesos?

19:09.697 --> 19:12.449
- Fifty.
- He killed four men.

19:17.746 --> 19:20.208
I could make it five.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.543
Fifty.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.298
- Where'II I find you?
- At the hoteI.

19:28.424 --> 19:31.760
We're riding south in the morning.
You got a horse?

19:31.885 --> 19:34.763
No... I'll get one.

19:42.813 --> 19:45.649
He is not very friendly.

19:45.773 --> 19:48.151
I'm not hiring friends.

19:48.276 --> 19:50.570
Are you going to talk all night?

19:51.154 --> 19:53.531
If you had any respect
for a condemned man,...

19:53.656 --> 19:57.118
.. you'd keep quiet and
let him spend his last hours in peace.

19:57.243 --> 20:00.371
- He is going to be shot in the morning.
- What'd he do?

20:00.496 --> 20:03.123
Huh! What didn't he do?

20:03.249 --> 20:05.709
That is Luis Emilio Delgado.

20:16.428 --> 20:19.390
I take it you did not understand me, senor.

20:19.848 --> 20:22.058
You are Luis Delgado.

20:22.184 --> 20:24.269
- You know me?
- Heard of you.

20:27.272 --> 20:30.150
Did I not tell you I was famous?

20:31.193 --> 20:33.653
That is his last request.

20:35.655 --> 20:38.824
You don't know how good
that makes a man feeI.

20:39.909 --> 20:42.787
- I can imagine.
- I mean you knowing my name,...

20:42.912 --> 20:44.539
.. who I am.

20:44.663 --> 20:48.250
For years I have said to myself
"Luis, the day will come...

20:48.376 --> 20:51.462
.. when you'll not have to
ride in the dust of others,...

20:51.587 --> 20:53.881
.. when everyone will know who you are. "

20:54.006 --> 20:58.093
"There'll not be a train or a village
robbed that people will not say...

20:58.218 --> 21:02.556
.. 'The one who robbed from us
was el bandido Luis Emilio Delgado. "'

21:03.974 --> 21:08.895
And just when I was about to
amount to something, this had to happen.

21:09.021 --> 21:13.733
What will people think of me when they
find out I was shot for killing one man?

21:13.858 --> 21:16.360
One stinking little man.

21:16.486 --> 21:19.197
I have killed a dozen
in a single day. More!

21:21.199 --> 21:25.244
- I tell you, senor, there is no justice.
- What if they don't find out?

21:25.370 --> 21:28.331
- But they will.
- Not if you ride south with me.

21:29.582 --> 21:33.752
Against 50 guns, maybe more?
The odds are not good.

21:34.503 --> 21:37.715
Better than you'll have
against that wall tomorrow.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.842
You've got a point.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.344
Well?

21:42.469 --> 21:46.389
- What is the pay?
- Whatever it takes to get you out.

21:48.309 --> 21:50.643
- Fair enough.
- How much?

21:51.728 --> 21:53.897
- But, senor, I cannot.
- A hundred pesos.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.358
- They will stand me against the wall...
- 200.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.902
- I have a wife, six little ones...
- 250.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.655
Three. But I cannot let him go.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.574
He will have to escape.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.203
- Unlock it.
- Un momento, senor.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.378
Do you mind if I escape
first thing in the morning?

23:05.466 --> 23:07.509
Hello, Chris.

23:07.635 --> 23:12.389
It's gettin' so a fella can't find
an unattached woman anywhere hardly.

23:12.932 --> 23:15.392
Let's get out of here.

23:31.324 --> 23:33.743
Whew! That was a close one, huh?

23:34.410 --> 23:37.997
So was the last time.
And the time before that.

23:38.123 --> 23:41.751
- When'll you ever learn, Colbee?
- How'd I know she was married?

23:41.876 --> 23:46.463
Women ain't like cattle, with a brand to
let you know they're another man's stock.

23:46.589 --> 23:51.719
How would you like to use that gun belt
for more than just holding up your pants?

23:51.844 --> 23:56.223
A village was raided, a friend of mine
taken prisoner. I need help.

23:56.890 --> 23:59.434
Well, I'd like to
give you a hand, Chris, but...

23:59.560 --> 24:02.938
They took all the men...
drove them into the desert.

24:03.564 --> 24:06.441
I ain't been gettin' much sleep lately.

24:09.069 --> 24:12.196
- Took off all the men, you say?
- Two days ago.

24:14.908 --> 24:17.243
You mean
there's a village full of women...

24:17.369 --> 24:22.165
.. and no one there to help them
with their plantin' and their harvestin'?

24:22.290 --> 24:25.168
- No husbands?
- No husbands.

24:28.463 --> 24:30.172
The hell you say.

26:02.264 --> 26:04.676
How'd you do?

26:07.402 --> 26:10.395
They any good?

26:10.530 --> 26:13.032
They're alive.

26:21.522 --> 26:23.488
Hey!

26:23.623 --> 26:26.615
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doin'?

26:28.716 --> 26:32.022
- Basta con el pequeno.
- He said the little one had enough.

26:32.157 --> 26:34.703
- But I had my money bet on him.
- You lost.

26:34.838 --> 26:37.609
Why, you...

27:28.324 --> 27:31.674
The little one's had enough.

27:34.356 --> 27:37.216
Touch that gun, I'll kill you.

27:41.282 --> 27:43.785
Are you all right?

27:46.958 --> 27:49.592
Si, senor.

28:04.519 --> 28:07.199
Senor... Me llamo Manuel.

28:08.628 --> 28:12.874
Yo he oido que busca pistoleros.
? Podria llevarme?

28:13.544 --> 28:17.877
He says his name is ManueI.
He heard we were looking for fighters.

28:18.012 --> 28:20.648
He'd like to come along.

28:27.351 --> 28:30.477
- You're gonna take him?
- For luck.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.500
Counting Chico, that makes seven.

29:48.932 --> 29:51.143
Buenos dias. It's a lovely day, no?

29:51.269 --> 29:53.936
- You're late.
- I overslept.

29:54.063 --> 29:57.317
Let's get the hell outta here!

30:57.506 --> 30:59.550
Gracias.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.182
- Coffee?
- Oh.

31:06.306 --> 31:09.018
Don't mind if I do. Don't mind at all.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.779
You'd never know she's around,
would you, quiet like she is?

31:23.076 --> 31:25.452
Had me a quiet woman once.

31:25.577 --> 31:27.997
Outside she was calm as Sunday.

31:28.122 --> 31:30.708
Inside she was wild
like mountain scenery.

31:31.584 --> 31:34.336
I'm gonna ride back that way again
one of these days.

31:34.461 --> 31:36.339
- Where's that?
- Sonora Town.

31:38.092 --> 31:40.760
- I was there once.
- Once?

31:40.885 --> 31:43.554
- You mean you didn't go back?
- For what?

31:44.014 --> 31:48.351
Well, there's over ten head of females
for every male in Sonora, that's for what.

31:48.477 --> 31:52.231
And I oughta know. I went through
over half of 'em one night.

31:53.024 --> 31:57.112
And woulda got around to the rest of 'em
if I hadn't pulled a leg muscle.

31:57.402 --> 32:01.241
I was buckin' horses this side of the line
and sellin' 'em tame up in Deming.

32:01.366 --> 32:04.494
Now, a good amount of 'em
was no more than hoorah girls,...

32:04.619 --> 32:07.581
.. but the way I look at it,
a woman's a woman.

32:07.705 --> 32:10.168
Ain't that right, Frank?

32:11.250 --> 32:13.920
You talk too much, Colbee.

32:15.005 --> 32:18.718
Since when can a man
talk too much about a woman?

32:22.679 --> 32:24.766
- Since when?
- Colbee!

32:28.728 --> 32:32.024
- You take the first watch.
- But you said Vin was a'gonna.

32:32.148 --> 32:34.775
I changed my mind. Go on.

32:55.632 --> 32:58.092
You didn't have to do that, Chris.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.763
I wouldn't push him into a fight,
if that's what you think.

33:01.887 --> 33:05.642
If you had, you might have
been in trouble. He's fast.

33:06.644 --> 33:09.272
Fast as you are?

33:10.357 --> 33:13.401
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.

33:13.526 --> 33:15.779
I'll remember that.

33:18.531 --> 33:20.784
Do that.

33:35.091 --> 33:38.261
I wonder why the hell
they took Chico and them others off.

33:38.386 --> 33:40.722
Damned if I know.

33:40.847 --> 33:44.602
Time we get to the village, blowsand will
have covered up any tracks.

33:44.726 --> 33:48.647
If we strike out blind,
we don't stand a chance of findin' 'em.

33:52.609 --> 33:56.155
Petra said there were
two other villages raided.

33:56.280 --> 33:59.116
That means they took
close to 300 prisoners.

34:00.534 --> 34:03.956
Only one way to move
that many men on foot in the desert.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.165
Like cattle.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.418
From one water hole to the other.

34:08.543 --> 34:11.547
Well, that don't
narrow it down too awfuI much.

34:11.670 --> 34:14.592
Lotta cow trails
between here and the Sierra Madre.

34:14.717 --> 34:17.387
Herds moving on them every day.

34:17.511 --> 34:19.972
Word gets round.

34:21.891 --> 34:24.393
What do we do in the meantime?

34:24.518 --> 34:28.732
Drop Petra and the boy off at the village
and start riding a wide circle.

34:28.855 --> 34:33.610
- See if we can cut their traiI.
- That could take one hell of a long time.

34:34.279 --> 34:38.116
I know. I haven't been
goin' anywhere for ten years.

34:38.784 --> 34:42.120
Vin, if you have to
worry about something,...

34:43.746 --> 34:49.338
.. worry about what happens after we find
Chico and the others, not if we find them.

36:05.711 --> 36:08.171
I never thought I'd come back.

36:44.209 --> 36:47.087
Vin, Colbee. Cut him down.

37:09.361 --> 37:12.448
- Get 'em out of here.
- Llevatelos de aqui.

38:39.166 --> 38:43.921
He escaped -
and see what they did.

38:45.297 --> 38:47.425
My poor little one.

38:56.934 --> 38:59.145
The DeviI's Spine.

38:59.271 --> 39:03.108
It ranges from the headwaters
of the Concho, north to the border.

39:03.941 --> 39:07.947
According to the woman, her husband
escaped from a village about here.

39:08.071 --> 39:10.741
That's where they're holding
Chico and the others.

39:10.867 --> 39:14.162
- Did he say why?
- He wasn't there long enough to find out.

39:14.286 --> 39:18.416
But there ain't no village between
the DeviI's Spine and the Concho.

39:18.541 --> 39:22.795
- That's what the man said.
- He was a long time in the desert, Chris.

39:22.921 --> 39:26.048
He coulda been out of his head,
got turned around.

39:26.175 --> 39:30.054
- He found his way here, didn't he?
- I'll catch up the horses.

39:30.179 --> 39:32.639
We'II leave in the morning.

39:33.808 --> 39:36.436
Ride out tonight, we could save time.

39:38.520 --> 39:41.024
Use up our animals, we'll be on foot.

39:41.148 --> 39:43.611
We'II leave in the morning.

39:45.279 --> 39:47.989
Better get some sleep.

39:49.074 --> 39:51.453
You too, Colbee.

40:14.351 --> 40:16.520
I wish to hell I knew for sure.

40:16.646 --> 40:19.106
Knew what?

40:19.941 --> 40:25.738
If I'm here because Chico's a friend, or if
I'm just on the prod for a fight like Frank.

40:25.863 --> 40:27.907
Killin' can get inside of you.

40:28.031 --> 40:30.827
And you think that's happened to you.

40:30.952 --> 40:32.996
Why else would I be here?

40:33.120 --> 40:35.414
Sure, Chico's a friend of mine, but...

40:35.541 --> 40:38.334
Hell, I don't even know his last name.

40:38.918 --> 40:41.379
Neither do I.

40:42.548 --> 40:44.842
Don't it make you wonder?

40:45.676 --> 40:47.720
No.

40:48.347 --> 40:50.389
How the hell come, Chris?

40:52.099 --> 40:55.227
Because in all the years
I've made my way with a gun,...

40:55.353 --> 40:58.731
.. I never once shot a man
just to see him fall.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.401
That time ever comes,...

41:01.525 --> 41:05.029
.. I throw my guns
in the water bucket and ride out.

41:07.407 --> 41:09.785
So will you.

41:31.685 --> 41:35.062
- Who does he belong to?
- His parents are dead.

41:36.147 --> 41:39.024
Chico looks after him like he was his own.

41:41.359 --> 41:44.739
Chris, why would they take
Chico and the others away?

41:47.241 --> 41:49.661
- I don't know.
- Maybe...

41:49.787 --> 41:53.332
.. if you went to the Rurales,
asked for help.

41:53.456 --> 41:57.337
- It wouldn't do any good.
- But they are supposed to protect us.

41:59.297 --> 42:02.091
- Have they ever?
- No.

42:02.216 --> 42:04.719
They never will.

42:04.844 --> 42:07.304
Because we are poor.

42:08.140 --> 42:10.600
Because we cannot pay them.

42:11.684 --> 42:13.979
That's true, isn't it?

42:15.523 --> 42:19.902
- Maybe someday it'll be different.
- And in the meantime?

42:20.902 --> 42:23.280
We do what we can.

42:24.406 --> 42:26.659
And die.

42:27.826 --> 42:30.163
There's always that.

42:30.288 --> 42:32.332
Chris.

42:35.835 --> 42:38.171
No matter what happens,...

42:38.296 --> 42:41.800
.. we will never forget you, and the others.

42:44.594 --> 42:47.056
That's all a man can ask.

44:00.384 --> 44:04.721
If you ask me, we ought've stayed on back
there and given them women a hand.

44:04.847 --> 44:08.351
They're gonna fall behind
in their plantin' and ploughin'.

44:08.476 --> 44:10.936
So will you, Colbee. So will you.

44:15.401 --> 44:17.569
How come you're still along, Luis?

44:17.694 --> 44:22.574
Thought once you got clear of that
firing squad, you'd head for the hills.

44:22.699 --> 44:25.535
- So did I.
- What changed your mind?

44:25.996 --> 44:28.622
Well, I had a long talk with myself.

44:29.081 --> 44:33.252
I said "Luis, in all the years
that I've known you,...

44:34.128 --> 44:37.590
.. you've not done one thing
for anyone but yourself. "

44:37.715 --> 44:41.511
"Not one. And it's
about time that you did. "

44:41.636 --> 44:46.766
"Where would you be if it was not for
the poor farmers you've stolen from?"

44:46.892 --> 44:50.104
"You would be nothing.
Help these poor people,...

44:50.897 --> 44:55.275
.. and you'll be able to ride proud,
with your head high up. "

44:55.401 --> 44:58.196
If somebody don't blow it off.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.907
Then I would die in good company.

45:01.033 --> 45:05.161
Hell... Chris there,
he's been killin' for ten years.

45:05.745 --> 45:08.415
Vin, about half that time.

45:08.541 --> 45:12.251
Colbee, he hunts other men's wives
between gun jobs.

45:13.379 --> 45:15.839
ManueI's nothin' but a chicken thief.

45:15.965 --> 45:18.009
And you?

45:18.133 --> 45:21.971
- I'm no better than they are.
- But you're still along.

45:22.096 --> 45:25.475
You coulda run for the hills, same as me.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.520
I got my reason for stayin'.

45:28.644 --> 45:32.274
And it don't have one damn thing
to do with friendship,...

45:32.400 --> 45:34.859
.. or helpin' poor farmers.

46:10.147 --> 46:13.359
- Buenas tardes, compadre Lorca.
- Buenas tardes, compadre.

46:13.484 --> 46:16.196
Have you seen the priest?
He was looking for you.

46:16.321 --> 46:19.241
- Again?
- He heard about the killings.

46:19.366 --> 46:21.951
He said we should have
tried to reason with them.

46:22.077 --> 46:26.374
Reason?
Did I build an empire upon reason?

46:26.749 --> 46:29.961
Did we reason with renegades,
bandits, corrupt officials?

46:30.085 --> 46:33.172
But these are not renegades, nor bandits.

46:34.882 --> 46:39.303
- Nor are they corrupt.
- You never tire of being my conscience.

46:39.429 --> 46:41.848
"The strong must be
generous to the weak. "

46:41.973 --> 46:44.850
You know who made up
that rule? The weak!

46:47.729 --> 46:52.443
Francisco, I have to talk to you.
Two workers were killed last night.

46:52.568 --> 46:56.071
- They were trying to escape.
- But you have no right.

46:57.573 --> 47:00.618
Look, Father. I know
your feelings for these people.

47:00.744 --> 47:04.289
But would it be a more honourable death
if they fell pulling a plough?

47:04.414 --> 47:09.002
- The Church cannot sanction...
- Sanction? You wanted a church.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.922
You couldn't pray it into existence
so you came to me.

47:12.046 --> 47:16.343
- You chose this place, these methods.
- For a reason.

47:16.468 --> 47:19.763
What reason can there be
for killing in cold blood, Francisco?

47:19.888 --> 47:24.060
- You wouldn't understand.
- I understand murder, slavery.

47:25.645 --> 47:30.358
Look, Father. I set out
to rebuild this church, this village,...

47:30.483 --> 47:34.279
.. and that is what I'm going to do,
with or without your blessing.

47:34.405 --> 47:36.865
I cannot stand by
and let this go on, Francisco.

47:36.991 --> 47:41.787
- Nothing says you have to stay.
- Everything says I have to stay.

47:46.417 --> 47:49.962
He is right, Father.
You should leave this place.

47:50.087 --> 47:52.131
- I can't.
- You mean you won't.

47:52.257 --> 47:54.509
I mean I can't.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.021
- Buenas tardes, senor.
- Buenas tardes.

48:43.522 --> 48:45.941
What can we do for you?

48:47.025 --> 48:49.528
A friend of mine.

48:49.653 --> 48:51.989
You're holding him prisoner.

48:53.073 --> 48:56.827
I want him. And all the others.

48:57.619 --> 48:59.871
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

49:00.247 --> 49:03.709
You are either a very stupid
or a very brave man, senor.

49:03.834 --> 49:06.795
One word from me
and you would be dead.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.548
That'll make two of us.

49:09.673 --> 49:13.593
There are five Winchesters
pointed at your head.

49:24.521 --> 49:26.773
Professionals.

49:27.774 --> 49:31.486
- Professionals.
- Perhaps we should have a little talk.

49:31.611 --> 49:33.989
We just did.

49:34.656 --> 49:38.201
- Father, you'd better get Francisco.
- Don't move, Father.

49:38.327 --> 49:41.788
- You would kill a priest?
- Only if I have to.

49:41.913 --> 49:46.627
Same old Chris.
I might have known you'd be along.

49:47.711 --> 49:49.755
It's good to...

50:00.974 --> 50:03.560
Whatever you and your men
are being paid,...

50:03.685 --> 50:06.897
.. I'll double it. I'll triple it.

50:07.481 --> 50:10.942
- Same old Lorca.
- Come. We will talk.

50:11.443 --> 50:15.197
- Can't do that.
- That's the only thing you can do.

50:15.322 --> 50:19.326
You're six against 60.
Don't expect these farmers to help you.

50:19.826 --> 50:22.037
They have no stomach to fight.

50:22.162 --> 50:24.206
- No?
- No.

50:33.382 --> 50:35.509
Kill him.

50:36.426 --> 50:38.887
Go on. Kill him.

50:40.138 --> 50:42.599
You've killed others.

50:46.812 --> 50:50.399
- But they didn't have guns.
- They had guns three years ago...

50:50.524 --> 50:54.152
.. when 200 men gave up their lives
inside the walls of this church.

50:54.277 --> 50:56.989
Gave up their lives
to rid this country of tyranny.

50:57.114 --> 50:59.449
Do you think it concerns these farmers...

50:59.574 --> 51:04.496
.. that I tracked bandits across miles of
desert and fought them on this ground...

51:04.621 --> 51:07.833
.. while they hid under their straw beds?

51:10.252 --> 51:12.754
Mis hijos.

51:12.879 --> 51:18.302
My sons. Tall, erect,
like two well-bred stallions.

51:19.136 --> 51:21.847
They're buried here with the others.

51:22.306 --> 51:26.059
No longer will their graves
be marked by ruins.

51:26.184 --> 51:28.729
This church, this village,...

51:28.854 --> 51:32.065
.. will be a monument
for those who fought so well.

51:32.190 --> 51:36.778
A monument built with the sweat
and blood of those who never fight.

51:37.863 --> 51:40.365
I'll prove it to you. Lopez.

51:40.824 --> 51:43.076
Do as he says.

51:45.829 --> 51:47.497
- Kill him.
- Francisco!

51:47.623 --> 51:52.002
- You stay out of this, Father.
- I have stayed out of it as long as I can.

51:53.045 --> 51:56.506
I beg you, Francisco, before it is too late.

51:56.632 --> 52:00.510
Before God damns you to hell
for what you are doing here.

52:05.349 --> 52:07.726
You spared my life once.

52:08.810 --> 52:11.146
Now I'm going to save yours.

52:11.271 --> 52:13.857
Take your vaqueros and ride out of here.

52:14.441 --> 52:16.568
Ride out and don't look back.

52:18.195 --> 52:20.572
I was wrong.

52:20.697 --> 52:22.908
You're not the same old Chris.

52:23.033 --> 52:28.163
I won't let you drown your grief in other
men's blood, if that's what you mean.

52:28.956 --> 52:31.208
Go on.

52:31.333 --> 52:33.585
Get out.

52:45.931 --> 52:48.600
Pues morimos, compadre.

52:53.730 --> 52:56.400
!Muchachos! !Vamonos!

53:23.760 --> 53:26.221
There will be a next time.

53:28.515 --> 53:30.058
!Vamonos!

53:45.115 --> 53:47.367
He will be back.

53:50.037 --> 53:50.954
I know.

54:10.515 --> 54:13.143
I swore I would never wear this again.

54:14.227 --> 54:18.148
What a man swears and what he does
isn't always the same.

54:19.816 --> 54:22.819
It's good to see you, Chris.

54:22.944 --> 54:25.197
Good to see you, Chico.

54:26.490 --> 54:28.533
Is it?

54:30.077 --> 54:32.537
Lorca has many men out there.

54:33.705 --> 54:36.041
I've been shot at before.

54:36.583 --> 54:40.003
But we cannot pay you to help us, Chris.

54:43.674 --> 54:45.717
I knew a young gun once.

54:45.842 --> 54:48.679
He was a wild,
mostly drunk kid when I met him.

54:48.804 --> 54:51.306
Turned out to be a man.

54:51.431 --> 54:54.518
Man enough to set his gun aside,
take a wife,...

54:54.643 --> 54:57.020
.. try to amount to something.

54:58.105 --> 55:00.565
He also turned out to be a friend.

55:01.900 --> 55:05.195
- Worth dying for?
- If I have to.

55:06.905 --> 55:09.324
What about the others?

55:10.409 --> 55:12.744
They're along for the fight.

55:12.869 --> 55:15.914
If it wasn't this one, it would be another.

55:16.999 --> 55:19.918
Get up in the bell tower.
Watch off toward the cemetery.

55:20.043 --> 55:23.005
If they come, it'll be from there.

55:24.131 --> 55:26.174
And Chico.

55:26.300 --> 55:29.761
Don't get too attached to that gun.
When this is over...

55:29.886 --> 55:34.141
I'll throw it in the water bucket...
and ride out.

56:07.341 --> 56:09.801
I did not know it would come to this.

56:12.304 --> 56:16.558
When Francisco lost his sons
I tried to give him consolation.

56:18.143 --> 56:22.689
He told me he wanted to build
a monument to those who had fallen.

56:22.814 --> 56:25.859
I convinced him it should be a church.

56:27.277 --> 56:29.529
I wanted it as much as he did.

56:31.239 --> 56:33.283
Even more.

56:33.408 --> 56:37.329
As God is my judge, I have tried
to help these poor souls,...

56:38.080 --> 56:40.290
.. tried for so long.

56:41.041 --> 56:43.502
I've spoken to them of faith,...

56:44.378 --> 56:46.421
.. of love.

56:47.339 --> 56:49.549
They believed me.

56:50.217 --> 56:54.137
But my words and their prayers
have changed nothing for them.

56:54.888 --> 56:57.516
The children have died,...

56:57.641 --> 56:59.685
.. the crops have failed.

57:00.435 --> 57:02.479
And now I have betrayed them.

57:02.604 --> 57:05.065
I'm not a religious man, Father.

57:06.608 --> 57:08.986
But I'll tell you this.

57:09.111 --> 57:12.948
They need you.
More now than ever before.

57:15.325 --> 57:17.786
I failed them.

57:19.496 --> 57:21.665
You failed yourself.

57:21.790 --> 57:24.376
Got knocked down.

57:24.501 --> 57:26.878
Get up, Father.

57:27.337 --> 57:29.798
At least as far as your knees.

58:00.037 --> 58:02.414
That's the last of 'em. Now what?

58:02.539 --> 58:06.627
- We movin' out tonight?
- We're not moving out at all.

58:07.127 --> 58:11.048
Catch us in the open with 300 men
on foot, we won't have a chance.

58:11.173 --> 58:14.760
- We gonna stand it out here?
- We got cover, we got supplies.

58:15.135 --> 58:18.930
And they have to come to us.
That cuts the odds in half.

58:20.223 --> 58:22.476
They won't lay out there very long.

58:22.601 --> 58:26.688
Like as not they'll try to
get it over with as fast as they can.

58:26.813 --> 58:30.400
- I wish to hell these walls were higher.
- They will be.

58:30.525 --> 58:33.570
You and Frank
split the workers in two groups.

58:33.695 --> 58:37.115
One take the south wall,
the other take the north.

58:37.240 --> 58:42.329
Get rocks, timbers, adobe blocks,
anything a man can stay alive behind,...

58:42.663 --> 58:44.706
.. and start building.

58:44.831 --> 58:47.542
- Now?
- Now.

59:57.613 --> 59:59.656
The storm is over.

59:59.781 --> 01:00:02.743
It's a long day's ride
to the hacienda, compadre.

01:00:02.868 --> 01:00:07.581
Would you have me run from seven guns
and those farmers? Those cowards?

01:00:07.914 --> 01:00:10.500
All we have left
is the ammunition in our belts,...

01:00:10.626 --> 01:00:13.795
.. the water in our canteens,
and the food in our stomachs.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.256
That is enough.

01:00:17.633 --> 01:00:20.010
That is more than enough.

01:02:06.575 --> 01:02:09.453
!Vamonos, muchachos! Adentro.

01:03:11.974 --> 01:03:14.434
!Vamonos, muchachos! !Vamonos!

01:04:17.247 --> 01:04:21.043
I don't know about you,
but that scared the hell outta me.

01:04:21.918 --> 01:04:26.757
- You reckon they'll hit us again?
- Just as hard as they can.

01:06:05.397 --> 01:06:08.317
Bring me a horse!

01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:10.694
Come on!

01:06:49.775 --> 01:06:51.818
Are you all right, compadre?

01:06:51.944 --> 01:06:54.404
I will make them suffer for this.

01:06:55.072 --> 01:06:57.699
I will make them all suffer for this.

01:06:58.158 --> 01:07:00.911
Lopez, you may ride to the hacienda.

01:07:01.745 --> 01:07:03.997
Get every man that works for me.

01:07:04.122 --> 01:07:06.833
Every boy old enough to carry a gun.

01:07:06.959 --> 01:07:09.878
The farmers, the vaqueros.
Bring them all here!

01:07:10.212 --> 01:07:13.632
But if I do that,
you will have nothing to go back to.

01:07:13.757 --> 01:07:17.761
The cattle will scatter into the hills
and the crops will faiI in the fields.

01:07:17.886 --> 01:07:20.347
All you have worked for, compadre.

01:07:20.472 --> 01:07:24.393
AII I have worked for
is buried beside that church.

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:26.979
My sons.

01:07:28.355 --> 01:07:30.816
Do as I say, compadre.

01:07:53.005 --> 01:07:56.049
Funny how your mind'll play tricks on ya.

01:07:56.174 --> 01:08:00.470
Up there, when they was comin' at us,
I got to thinkin' they were husbands.

01:08:00.595 --> 01:08:03.682
- Husbands?
- Ganged up on me.

01:08:04.141 --> 01:08:06.351
Sent a shiver up my spine.

01:08:06.476 --> 01:08:10.605
I swear, we get outta this, I ain't
ever gonna look at another woman. Ever!

01:08:10.731 --> 01:08:13.025
- Agh!
- Oh. Sorry.

01:08:20.657 --> 01:08:22.743
Looks like they're gonna wait for night.

01:08:22.868 --> 01:08:27.205
They hit us in the dark, it could get
kinda hard to stay alive in here.

01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:32.544
We make a run for it, we can be back
at the village in two days, maybe less.

01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:35.005
- And then what?
- Make our stand there.

01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:37.674
What about the women and children?

01:08:39.926 --> 01:08:41.970
Yeah.

01:08:42.763 --> 01:08:46.433
Looks like you should have
turned me in for that bounty.

01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:49.603
About that bounty, Chris.

01:08:49.728 --> 01:08:51.979
There never was a price on ya.

01:08:52.104 --> 01:08:55.442
I just wanted to ride
along with you for a ways.

01:08:58.028 --> 01:09:00.906
- Well, maybe they'll back off.
- Not Lorca.

01:09:01.782 --> 01:09:04.910
He won't let go
till this is over once and for good.

01:09:05.535 --> 01:09:08.287
You seem like you know him pretty well.

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:10.874
I was paid to kill him once.

01:09:10.999 --> 01:09:13.542
Shame you didn't get the job done.

01:09:14.711 --> 01:09:16.964
By his sons.

01:09:38.986 --> 01:09:41.363
His sons?

01:09:43.073 --> 01:09:47.661
He said they were tall, erect,
like finely bred stallions.

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:50.706
They weren't.

01:09:50.831 --> 01:09:53.542
They were gentle, like their mother.

01:09:54.668 --> 01:09:56.795
Lorca thought they were weak.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.841
He rode roughshod over them trying
to make them over in his own image.

01:10:00.966 --> 01:10:03.010
Their mother tried to stop him.

01:10:03.135 --> 01:10:05.429
Died trying.

01:10:05.554 --> 01:10:08.432
They hated him, wanted him dead.

01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:11.601
So they hired you.

01:10:11.727 --> 01:10:13.770
Lorca found out about it.

01:10:13.895 --> 01:10:16.356
He could have had me killed.

01:10:16.481 --> 01:10:19.151
Instead he gave me a horse,
let me ride out.

01:10:20.068 --> 01:10:22.529
Don't know why.

01:10:23.822 --> 01:10:26.408
Maybe he saw in you
what he never saw in his own.

01:10:26.533 --> 01:10:28.577
Maybe.

01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:33.206
Wonder how come
the two of 'em ended here.

01:10:33.332 --> 01:10:36.001
Knowing Lorca, he shamed them into it.

01:10:36.126 --> 01:10:39.171
Then why is he building
this church for 'em?

01:10:40.005 --> 01:10:42.591
Not for them, Vin. For him.

01:10:43.717 --> 01:10:48.305
He got his chance to do the one thing
he could never do when they were alive.

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.891
Be proud of them.

01:11:07.908 --> 01:11:10.369
What are they waiting for?

01:11:16.208 --> 01:11:19.586
I wish now that Petra
had never found you, Chris.

01:11:20.253 --> 01:11:22.965
That you'd never gotten into this.

01:11:25.092 --> 01:11:28.470
You and the others get killed,
what good will it do?

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.932
Nothing will change.

01:11:32.474 --> 01:11:35.686
No matter what happens here,
nothing will change.

01:11:36.937 --> 01:11:40.107
There'll always be someone like Lorca,...

01:11:40.232 --> 01:11:42.901
.. someone to push men around like cattle.

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:50.492
I've seen enough of fear,...

01:11:50.617 --> 01:11:53.078
.. running, hiding.

01:11:57.791 --> 01:12:01.628
When this is over,
I'm heading north across the border.

01:12:02.546 --> 01:12:05.048
I made my living with a gun once.

01:12:05.507 --> 01:12:07.759
I can do it again.

01:12:09.344 --> 01:12:11.930
What about Petra?

01:12:12.055 --> 01:12:16.935
Man runs out on his own people, doesn't
leave a wife a whole lot to be proud of.

01:12:19.938 --> 01:12:22.232
She'll understand.

01:12:23.317 --> 01:12:25.569
Will she?

01:14:10.048 --> 01:14:13.552
Chief Lopez
went to the hacienda.

01:14:13.677 --> 01:14:17.180
Tomorrow he'll bring 400 guns.

01:14:17.306 --> 01:14:20.309
If he does,
this will soon be over.

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:25.689
t- The sooner, the better.
- I agree.

01:14:32.112 --> 01:14:34.823
You'll get that old bird drunk,
you don't watch out.

01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:37.409
No entiendo.

01:14:37.534 --> 01:14:40.829
Tu hacer ese pajaro borracho.

01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:47.002
Hey, hello, Chris. Uh,...

01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:51.089
.. ManueI here, he's got somethin'
he wants to tell ya.

01:14:51.214 --> 01:14:53.842
Go on, ManueI. Tell him.

01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:56.178
Todo este tiempo...

01:14:56.303 --> 01:14:59.139
No, no, no. You tell him what I taught ya.

01:14:59.389 --> 01:15:01.850
Hable en ingles.

01:15:02.517 --> 01:15:05.896
For a long time...

01:15:08.899 --> 01:15:10.943
No, compadre.

01:15:11.693 --> 01:15:14.112
What he's tryin'
to tell you, Chris, is that...

01:15:14.237 --> 01:15:19.409
.. for a lotta years now he's been knockin'
around from one village to another.

01:15:20.369 --> 01:15:23.038
He ain't got no folks
that he can remember.

01:15:23.163 --> 01:15:26.249
He don't even know how old he is
except he's young and, uh,...

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:30.337
.. he's been called ManueI ever since
he was knee-high to a grasshopper.

01:15:30.462 --> 01:15:34.174
Another thing he remembers is that
he always felt kinda lost and lonely.

01:15:34.299 --> 01:15:38.011
- But he don't no more. Know why?
- No. Why?

01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:42.307
Because when I was out there stompin'
around in the rain last night,...

01:15:42.432 --> 01:15:47.646
.. I come across a sign with the name of
the village on it. Something "DeI Norte".

01:15:47.771 --> 01:15:50.232
- First part of it had been burned off.
- So?

01:15:50.357 --> 01:15:53.694
So, ManueI was always
lookin' for some place to come from,...

01:15:53.819 --> 01:15:57.030
.. some place he can belong to,
be proud of. Now he can.

01:15:57.155 --> 01:15:59.992
Village ain't got no people,
he ain't got no village.

01:16:00.117 --> 01:16:04.913
- So from now on they can call him...
- ManueI from Something DeI Norte.

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.333
Yeah! It's got a nice ring to it, ain't it?

01:16:09.334 --> 01:16:11.378
Yeah.

01:16:12.796 --> 01:16:15.257
Uh, Chris. Um...

01:16:17.342 --> 01:16:21.054
Anyhow, uh... Think we oughta
get him outta here safe?

01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:25.142
You know, he ain't
a whole lot with a gun, and, uh,...

01:16:25.767 --> 01:16:28.770
.. they keep comin' at us
that way, he's gonna get hurt.

01:16:28.895 --> 01:16:31.607
Maybe we could
send him off somewheres.

01:16:32.524 --> 01:16:34.776
If we did, I'd sure feeI a whole lot better.

01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:37.070
What about him?

01:16:37.195 --> 01:16:39.239
How'd he feeI?

01:16:39.364 --> 01:16:42.284
Now that he's finally
got something to belong to.

01:16:42.409 --> 01:16:44.453
Yep...

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.497
Frank was right.

01:16:48.582 --> 01:16:50.250
I talk too damn much.

01:17:09.478 --> 01:17:11.730
It's Frank!

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.652
- You all right?
- Just a crease.

01:17:16.777 --> 01:17:19.363
Were you tryin' to get
your head blowed off?

01:17:19.488 --> 01:17:21.657
It's my head.

01:17:23.116 --> 01:17:26.662
You get yourself killed,
it won't do anybody any good.

01:17:26.787 --> 01:17:29.289
Depends how you look at it.

01:17:32.042 --> 01:17:34.419
What's eatin' him?

01:17:40.592 --> 01:17:43.512
I saw you up there
on the wall this morning.

01:17:44.179 --> 01:17:46.556
Now this.

01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:49.518
- Why?
- None of your damn business.

01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:54.773
Chris.

01:17:55.983 --> 01:17:58.527
You never knew my wife, did you?

01:17:59.403 --> 01:18:01.697
We had us a place in West Texas.

01:18:01.822 --> 01:18:07.119
Wasn't much, just gettin' started. Had
a herd to build, wire to string and such.

01:18:08.453 --> 01:18:11.415
One night some Comanches got drunk,...

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:15.419
.. jumped the reservation,
lit out, killin', burnin'...

01:18:15.544 --> 01:18:19.548
We woke up, they was all
around the cabin - 1 4, 1 5 of 'em.

01:18:20.007 --> 01:18:24.052
I held 'em off as long as I could
till I only had one shell left.

01:18:26.388 --> 01:18:29.182
Ellie screamed at me
not to let 'em take her alive.

01:18:29.308 --> 01:18:32.519
She'd... seen what they'd done to others.

01:18:34.563 --> 01:18:37.441
She kept beggin' me, beggin'...

01:18:39.318 --> 01:18:40.944
So I...

01:18:44.573 --> 01:18:46.867
The Comanches saw what I'd done.

01:18:47.868 --> 01:18:52.456
I thought they'd kill me too,
but they didn't. They just rode off.

01:18:54.082 --> 01:18:56.627
Next morning I started trackin' 'em.

01:18:57.294 --> 01:19:00.922
Killed 'em one at a time,
all the while hopin' they'd kill me.

01:19:01.048 --> 01:19:04.843
Five years, I've been tryin'
to get the job done.

01:19:05.927 --> 01:19:09.681
But it don't look like
I have to wait much longer.

01:19:09.806 --> 01:19:12.434
I heard 'em talkin' out there.
Lorca sent for help.

01:19:12.559 --> 01:19:15.854
Come tomorrow he's gonna
have 200 guns, maybe more.

01:19:15.979 --> 01:19:19.066
And he's not gonna
settle for just us, Chris.

01:19:20.776 --> 01:19:23.403
He wants 'em all dead.

01:19:23.528 --> 01:19:25.989
Every last one of 'em.

01:19:39.711 --> 01:19:41.755
Senor...

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.218
The others, they have
asked me to talk to you.

01:19:48.136 --> 01:19:53.558
They don't want you
to die here because of them.

01:19:54.935 --> 01:19:57.271
Go.

01:19:57.396 --> 01:20:00.065
While there is still time.

01:20:00.774 --> 01:20:03.235
They will not kill us all.

01:20:04.778 --> 01:20:08.907
Those who are left
will return to the village,...

01:20:11.159 --> 01:20:13.412
.. begin again.

01:20:13.954 --> 01:20:16.415
If we are strong like you...

01:20:17.082 --> 01:20:19.960
But we are not. We are weak.

01:20:20.794 --> 01:20:24.256
- Too weak to fight.
- You fight every day of your lives.

01:20:25.132 --> 01:20:27.634
You fight the land to grow crops.

01:20:27.759 --> 01:20:30.929
You fight to keep a roof over your heads,
clothes on your back.

01:20:31.054 --> 01:20:34.182
- That is not the same.
- The hell it's not.

01:20:35.892 --> 01:20:38.103
We are cowards, senor.

01:20:38.228 --> 01:20:41.315
We are afraid of everyone, of everything.

01:20:42.774 --> 01:20:46.111
Our whole life is one of fear.

01:20:47.946 --> 01:20:50.198
We are born with it.

01:20:51.074 --> 01:20:53.452
We die with it.

01:20:53.577 --> 01:20:57.998
It is our way. It will always be our way.

01:20:58.915 --> 01:21:01.335
Please, senor.

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.712
We beg you.

01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:06.548
Before it is too late.

01:21:07.966 --> 01:21:10.719
Go... please.

01:21:35.243 --> 01:21:37.829
You ain't thinkin'
of runnin', are you, Chris?

01:21:37.955 --> 01:21:40.332
He may be right.

01:21:42.876 --> 01:21:46.630
I knew a fella once.
He was loud, always braggin'.

01:21:47.673 --> 01:21:50.342
Inside he was afraid of his own shadow.

01:21:50.467 --> 01:21:54.137
Never woulda got over it either,
if this other fella hadn't come along.

01:21:54.262 --> 01:21:56.348
I'm talkin' about that night in Texas...

01:21:56.473 --> 01:21:59.351
.. when you made me stand
alongside you in the street.

01:21:59.476 --> 01:22:02.062
I remember you had to
knock me down four times...

01:22:02.187 --> 01:22:04.398
.. before I'd go against them guns.

01:22:05.899 --> 01:22:08.694
We got to do the same for them, Chris.

01:22:08.819 --> 01:22:13.365
We got to stand alongside of 'em
so that someday they can stand alone.

01:22:14.866 --> 01:22:18.161
I thought all you did
was think about women, Colbee.

01:22:18.287 --> 01:22:20.372
I used to be afraid of them too.

01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:25.210
We ain't gonna run, are we, Chris?

01:22:26.169 --> 01:22:28.213
Hell, no.

01:22:46.565 --> 01:22:49.192
Orate, frates.

01:23:00.287 --> 01:23:04.082
If you're thinkin' about goin' out there,
we'd better get at it.

01:23:04.207 --> 01:23:08.253
Those others get here,
the hills are gonna get higher to climb.

01:23:08.378 --> 01:23:10.672
How many men does he have left?

01:23:10.797 --> 01:23:13.050
I counted 30.

01:23:13.675 --> 01:23:16.762
We could circle high around
and come at 'em from behind.

01:23:16.887 --> 01:23:19.389
One chance in hell.

01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:22.851
That's better than none at all.

01:23:25.646 --> 01:23:27.648
Saddle the horses.

01:23:27.773 --> 01:23:30.025
I already did.

01:24:21.243 --> 01:24:23.287
Tu quedate aqui.

01:24:23.412 --> 01:24:25.580
Ain't you gonna take him with us?

01:24:25.706 --> 01:24:29.626
- He'll cover us from the bell tower.
- We'll need all the help we can get.

01:24:29.751 --> 01:24:32.087
He stays behind.

01:24:32.212 --> 01:24:35.882
- For luck?
- For luck.

01:25:12.336 --> 01:25:13.962
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.

01:25:14.254 --> 01:25:16.298
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.

01:27:05.782 --> 01:27:07.826
Chris!

01:27:10.579 --> 01:27:12.372
Hey! Come on!

01:27:41.151 --> 01:27:43.195
Chris!

01:27:43.695 --> 01:27:45.739
Keep going.

01:27:56.833 --> 01:27:59.503
Ya! Giddap! Ya!

01:30:14.304 --> 01:30:16.056
Chris!

01:30:31.863 --> 01:30:34.366
!Alto el fuego! !Alto!

01:30:44.918 --> 01:30:46.962
Vamonos.

01:31:15.657 --> 01:31:17.993
I got it done, Chris.

01:31:18.869 --> 01:31:21.121
I finally...

01:31:30.881 --> 01:31:32.924
Chris.

01:32:18.053 --> 01:32:20.430
Kill them. Kill them.

01:32:25.811 --> 01:32:28.772
Don't stop. Kill them.

01:32:29.523 --> 01:32:31.566
Kill them.

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:13.066
It was Chico's idea
to finish building the church,...

01:33:13.191 --> 01:33:16.361
.. to bring all three villages here
and make them into one.

01:33:16.486 --> 01:33:19.573
- I thought you were heading north.
- I changed my mind.

01:33:19.698 --> 01:33:21.825
- I'm ready to go, Chico.
- Go where?

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:25.912
- Well, back to get the rest of the women.
- He volunteered.

01:33:27.247 --> 01:33:29.875
- So long, Colbee.
- So long, Chris.

01:33:43.388 --> 01:33:45.849
Too bad the others
couldn't have seen this.

01:33:45.974 --> 01:33:49.353
We'll remember them in our prayers.

01:33:49.478 --> 01:33:52.814
- Goodbye, Chico.
- Chris.

01:33:54.232 --> 01:33:56.485
So long, Padre, Chico.

01:33:56.610 --> 01:33:59.071
- Adios.
- God bless you.

01:34:32.938 --> 01:34:34.982
I'll be damned.

01:34:36.692 --> 01:34:39.027
I doubt that.

01:34:39.152 --> 01:34:41.613
I doubt that very much.

01:35:36.543 --> 01:35:38.837
