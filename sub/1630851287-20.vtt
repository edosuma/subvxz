Okay...

00:38.947 --> 00:40.781
How were my homemade
lemon lime bars?

00:40.875 --> 00:42.524
Is there enough zest? Oh, God.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.768

-Oh, um, it was okay.
-Just okay?

01:42.919 --> 01:45.920
I guess I just felt like the
coming-out part was a bit much.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.998
It's always so dramatic
in movies,

01:48.016 --> 01:49.666
but it's never like that
in real life.

01:49.685 --> 01:51.610
In real life,
you just tell your family,

01:51.761 --> 01:52.945
and they're like,
"That's great. Love you."

01:53.096 --> 01:55.021
And then you go back
to removing the elderly bear

01:55.116 --> 01:56.615
that dropped dead
on your property or whatever.

01:56.692 --> 01:59.601
Hmm. I mean, my coming-out
didn't cause a car crash,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.027
but my mom and dad did

02:01.180 --> 02:02.979
<i> set off a bunch of</i>
<i> illegal fireworks in support.</i>

02:02.981 --> 02:04.848
-What's going on?
-Our son is gay.

02:04.941 --> 02:06.016
And after a brief time

02:06.185 --> 02:07.684
processing our feelings
about it,

02:07.777 --> 02:09.444
we've chosen to celebrate him
with fireworks.

<i> -CRISPIN: And they burned down</i>
<i> our mailbox...</i>

02:12.282 --> 02:14.024
<i> ...and we were fined</i>
<i> thousands of dollars.</i>

02:14.042 --> 02:15.859
So, overall, it was pretty wild.

02:16.028 --> 02:17.636
Wow. That sounds intense.

02:17.863 --> 02:19.120
Well, coming out is intense.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.806
I'm sure the first time
you told your family,

02:21.033 --> 02:22.290
it was pretty dramatic, right?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.626
I'm not sure I can remember
the first time, per se.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.961
(gasps) Oh, wait. I know,
I said it when we were driving

02:26.981 --> 02:28.480

02:28.707 --> 02:31.057
Oh, um, hey, guys. I'm gay.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.727
We know, son. And we love you
just the way you are.

02:33.879 --> 02:36.880
Or maybe it was when we went
to see Judy's improv group.

02:36.882 --> 02:39.992
I would love a suggestion
of a common phrase.

02:40.219 --> 02:41.218
I am gay.

02:41.311 --> 02:43.387
All right, I heard, "I am gay."

03:01.831 --> 03:03.998
(scoffs) I didn't want drama.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.243

03:50.731 --> 03:53.123
<i> A.J. DOSSIER:</i>
<i> The Room Service Reaper</i>
<i> was in police custody,</i>

03:53.141 --> 03:55.567
<i> but for John Thimbleman,</i>
<i> it was too late.</i>

03:55.719 --> 03:58.128
<i> His entrails were strewn</i>
<i> all about the hotel room,</i>

03:58.146 --> 04:00.130
<i> and his head was in</i>
<i> the ice bucket.</i>

04:00.299 --> 04:01.465
That was amazing.

04:01.558 --> 04:03.075
How long have we been
sitting out here?

04:03.302 --> 04:05.727
Four hours. I went from
having to pee really badly

04:05.821 --> 04:07.079
to not having to pee at all.

04:07.230 --> 04:09.248
I guess my body just
reabsorbed the pee.

04:09.399 --> 04:10.974
I can't believe A.J. Dossier

04:11.067 --> 04:12.417
didn't know anything
about podcasting

04:12.644 --> 04:14.327
and then solved
the Room Service Reaper case.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.754
It's almost like
we could do that.

04:15.981 --> 04:17.647
Great idea, my audio angel.

04:17.741 --> 04:19.833
We already have
a video production company.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.260
We'll just add a podcast arm.

04:21.411 --> 04:24.746
How hard can it be to track down
an Alaskan serial killer

04:24.840 --> 04:26.372
that's eluded the police
for decades?

04:26.508 --> 04:29.009
Yeah. And I think the sponsors
send you free products.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.436
I'd love to get my hands
on a pair of those clogs

04:31.588 --> 04:33.346
that are just for jogging--
Cl'jogs.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.665
Apparently,
the sound is deafening.

04:35.684 --> 04:38.668
I can't believe it's already
sock-darning season again.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.670
What does everyone else
have planned for the weekend?

04:40.764 --> 04:43.340
We'll be hard at work
adding a podcast arm

04:43.433 --> 04:45.617
to our video production company,
Pause For Applause.

04:45.769 --> 04:48.269
Oh, I just listened to one about
co-parenting adult children

04:48.363 --> 04:49.937
with Rhea Perlman
and Danny DeVito.

04:50.032 --> 04:52.106
No offense, Judy,
but I would rather die

04:52.200 --> 04:53.775
-than listen to that.
-He said it.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.961
But, yeah, we're focusing
on the true-crime genre.

04:56.188 --> 04:59.113
All that stands between us and
a big podcast hit is selecting

04:59.133 --> 05:01.616
which of Alaska's horrific
unsolved crimes to cover.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.802
It's gonna be dangerous
and dangerously profitable.

05:03.953 --> 05:06.471
Crispin and I are gonna be
pretty busy as well.

05:06.698 --> 05:08.715
He's gonna help me
redo my coming-out.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.976
Uh-oh.
Did we do something wrong?

05:11.127 --> 05:13.053
No. You guys did
everything right.

05:13.205 --> 05:15.147
You didn't make
a big deal out of it.

05:15.298 --> 05:16.873
Yeah, you did it too right.

05:16.966 --> 05:18.558
So he's looking
for just that little bit

05:18.652 --> 05:20.060
of drama that he missed out on.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.562
I get that. As one of Alaska's
preeminent allies,

05:22.714 --> 05:24.156
I take extra responsibility.

05:24.383 --> 05:26.641
How can we help?
What, specifically, do you want

05:26.660 --> 05:28.327
from your ideal redo coming-out?

05:28.478 --> 05:31.163
Hmm. For starters, I guess
I'd like a classic, sharp gasp.

05:31.314 --> 05:33.815
Oh, um, I'd also love
to encounter someone

05:33.983 --> 05:35.316
who simply can't believe it.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.503
Um, a shattered fragile item
interests me. Uh...

05:38.730 --> 05:41.322
Ooh, and I've never had to
immediately respond

05:41.342 --> 05:43.342
to an offensive question like,
"But who's the woman?"

05:43.527 --> 05:45.326
So that could be fun,
but I'm flexible.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.587
I mean, no one person
could check all those boxes.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.255
Actually, Ham, they just might.

05:49.408 --> 05:51.241
And you may not have to look
outside of our family.

05:51.334 --> 05:53.927
You happen to be related
to one of the most uptight

05:54.079 --> 05:55.912
and judgmental people on Earth:

05:55.931 --> 05:58.172
Cousin Danica.
She's uniquely awful.

05:58.266 --> 06:00.192
As a family,
we took a trip to the zoo,

06:00.343 --> 06:03.695
and she kept whispering "whore"
at any animal with kids.

06:03.847 --> 06:07.348
Wow, Ham. Oh, sounds like she's
gonna hate that you're gay.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.259
-Exciting.
-(chuckling): Oh, yes.

06:09.352 --> 06:11.352
She's always hated
everything about me.

06:11.430 --> 06:12.854
I mean, sure, marrying your mom

06:13.022 --> 06:14.447
wasn't the smartest thing
I ever did,

06:14.600 --> 06:17.024
but when Danica sent back
Moon's baby announcement

06:17.119 --> 06:19.285
with "please make it stop"
written on the back,

06:19.438 --> 06:20.712
I cut off contact for good.

06:20.864 --> 06:23.882
Yet here I am, all these years
later, still going.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.959
What do you say we pay her
a visit tomorrow?

06:26.111 --> 06:27.535
She's all the way down
in Orca Bay,

06:27.629 --> 06:29.170
so we'll want to leave
bright and early.

06:29.281 --> 06:31.631
Oh, Dad, I'd love to,
but I kind of got

06:31.783 --> 06:34.208
a lot on my plate with
this whole re-coming-out thing.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.894
She's the one you're gonna
come out to, sweetie.

06:36.121 --> 06:38.121
Oh, yeah.
That makes way more sense.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.731
I was like, "Random."

06:42.569 --> 06:45.112
All right, every
true-crime podcast is only

06:45.297 --> 06:46.479
as good as the creep
it investigates,

06:46.573 --> 06:48.740
so we got to pick
the perfect criminal.

06:48.892 --> 06:50.558
Ooh. How about
the Moose Mixologist?

06:50.636 --> 06:53.303
This guy used to feed
high-proof cocktails to moose,

06:53.363 --> 06:54.487
then unleash them on the people

06:54.581 --> 06:56.156
of Downtown Fairbanks--
to trample them.

06:56.308 --> 06:58.975
Wolf, you know stampedes
are one of my biggest fears.

06:58.994 --> 07:01.068
How did<i> Jumanji</i>
get that PG-13 rating?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.904
Thousands of elephants
smashing explorers

07:02.998 --> 07:05.331
into human jelly with their
enormous feet? No, thank you.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.074
I'm sorry to have even
mentioned it,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.577
my hippo-phobic hottie,
and I will also gently offer

07:09.596 --> 07:12.172
that you may have misremembered
some of<i> Jumanji.</i>

07:12.324 --> 07:15.082
Okay, how about
a down-the-middle serial killer?

07:15.177 --> 07:16.768
The Orca Bay Slicer.

07:16.845 --> 07:18.252
This killer, most likely a lady,

07:18.346 --> 07:20.330
just lived to kill
rich guys in their cars.

07:20.423 --> 07:22.590
Oh, wow. Says here
that after she killed them

07:22.609 --> 07:23.942
she would chop off their wieners
and leave

07:24.093 --> 07:26.260
a hot dog in their laps
as a calling card.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.671
Okay, girl, I'm listening.

07:27.689 --> 07:30.431
Yeah. Profilers, quote,
"believe that the hot dogs

07:30.509 --> 07:32.284
"either represented
the men's penises

07:32.360 --> 07:35.436
or that the Orca Bay Slicer
just simply loved hot dogs."

07:35.456 --> 07:37.847
A patriarchy-hating
hot dog enthusiast?

07:38.016 --> 07:39.683
Girl, we could've been
best friends,

07:39.701 --> 07:41.868
but then you went and did
all those murders.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.444
So, instead of eating
hot dogs with you

07:43.538 --> 07:45.021
and discussing
the right way to do

07:45.114 --> 07:46.798
a<i> Mystic Pizza</i>
musical adaptation,

07:46.950 --> 07:48.191
I got to investigate you.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.527
And since she was last active
in Orca Bay,

07:50.620 --> 07:52.378
we can drive down
to Cousin Danica's separately

07:52.473 --> 07:56.475
and stop for hot dogs--
I mean clues-- along the way.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.718
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> Okay, we're getting close,</i>
<i> so remember:</i>

07:58.870 --> 08:02.647
we get in, Ham says he's gay,
she judges Ham, then we get out.

08:02.799 --> 08:05.150
We're looking for a gasp,
some shocking remarks,

08:05.301 --> 08:08.061
and I would really love it
if her shoes flew off.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.896
Improbable, maybe,
but I would still love it.

08:10.048 --> 08:12.640
It would be wonderful if she
jumped through a closed window,

08:12.659 --> 08:14.067
leaving her exact silhouette.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.402
She might even rip off
her brooch and throw it at you.

08:16.555 --> 08:18.479
(gasps) Imagine if it lodged
in your cheek.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.498
(gasps) A dream.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.224
I'm glad you guys are excited,
but, Ham,

08:21.226 --> 08:22.392
if the judgment is too harsh,

08:22.485 --> 08:23.835
we can get the hell
out of there.

08:23.987 --> 08:25.061
You just say the word.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.913
Okay, but instead
of saying the word,

08:27.065 --> 08:29.174
can I say a fun phrase like,
"Where's my soup?"

08:29.325 --> 08:32.677
or "Get these ants off of me!"

08:32.829 --> 08:35.162
Okay, update: If Ham says,
"Where's my soup?"

08:35.182 --> 08:39.267
or "Get these ants off of me,"
we all head for the door.

08:40.003 --> 08:41.686
Danica, you nincompoop.

08:41.838 --> 08:44.247
I could've sworn
I put this away.

08:44.340 --> 08:46.099
So, Beef and family.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.085
Wow, you all look
much better in pictures.

08:49.104 --> 08:52.197
Thank you for allowing us
to stop by on such short notice.

08:52.348 --> 08:55.516
I told the children they simply
must meet my favorite cousin.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.278
Well, the feeling is not mutual,
but come on in.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.930
I've placed blankets
on the couches you can sit on.

09:01.024 --> 09:02.115
I assume you don't wipe well.

09:02.191 --> 09:06.286
Wow, Danica,
your house is very brown.

09:06.438 --> 09:08.046
Yes, brown's my favorite color.

09:08.273 --> 09:10.865
All the other colors are
so desperate for attention.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.592
"Ooh, I'm pink. Look at me."

09:12.702 --> 09:14.944
Now, I'm cooking a roast,
and until it's ready,

09:14.963 --> 09:16.780
I thought we might
just sit here.

09:16.873 --> 09:18.448
Judy, are those leggings
something

09:18.541 --> 09:20.283
you must wear
for a medical reason,

09:20.376 --> 09:23.469
-or are you just
a big old floozy?
-A floozy?

09:23.546 --> 09:26.623
Yes, a loose lady,
a good-time gal, a harlot?

09:26.641 --> 09:28.066
In short, a total sleazebag?

09:28.217 --> 09:30.402
(chuckling):
Wow, I've never
been so insulted.

09:30.629 --> 09:31.978
This is kind of fun.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.179
So, how's school?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.315
-Are any of you reading yet?
-Nope.

09:35.467 --> 09:36.908
(gasps)
Keep your hands off

09:37.060 --> 09:38.651
my ceramic rabbit collection.

09:38.745 --> 09:39.986
But there's just one.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.581
There's also just one
Lincoln Memorial.

09:42.732 --> 09:44.140
Seems a little different

09:44.142 --> 09:46.326
and also not a collection,
but okay.

09:46.478 --> 09:49.254
Ham, I simply must ask you,
what's with the long hair?

09:49.497 --> 09:51.238
Are you gonna sell it
to buy drugs?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.666
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> On our way to do</i>
<i> real-life field work.</i>

09:53.819 --> 09:56.410
The Orca Bay Slicer is not
gonna know what hit her.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.004
We're like Starsky and Hutch.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.247
Or<i> SVU's</i> Mariska Hargitay and...

10:00.267 --> 10:02.934
the guy with the long neck who
helps<i> SVU's</i> Mariska Hargitay.

10:03.161 --> 10:04.769
Christopher Meloni.
God, I admire that gorgeous,

10:04.996 --> 10:06.329
crime-fighting giraffe.

10:06.348 --> 10:08.348
Anyway, should we go over
what we know so far?

10:08.500 --> 10:09.515
Oh, yeah, we should record it,

10:09.668 --> 10:11.167
and we can use it
on our first episode.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.445
(hushed):
The Orca Bay Slicer was like

10:13.596 --> 10:16.339
a lot of serial killers
except for one thing:

10:16.358 --> 10:18.599
her signature crotch hot dog.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.285
Why are you talking
in that weird voice?

10:20.436 --> 10:21.786
(regular voice):
It's my podcaster voice.

10:22.013 --> 10:23.788
Ooh, I want to try
a podcaster voice. Okay.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.123
(with accent):
The Orca Bay Slicer is

10:25.274 --> 10:27.867
one of Alaska's only
female serial killers.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.686
(chuckling):
Oh, Australian. I love it.

10:29.779 --> 10:32.464
You can throw your voice
on my barbie anytime.

10:32.691 --> 10:34.615
(regular accent):
Wolf, that was a British accent.

10:34.709 --> 10:35.967
Oh, uh, then I meant:

10:36.119 --> 10:38.136
You can throw your voice
on my parliament anytime.

10:38.363 --> 10:39.696
There you go, babe.

10:40.456 --> 10:44.309
I can't tell you how much
I enjoy sitting in silence.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.460
-(sighs)
-(Ham clears throat)

10:46.538 --> 10:49.314
-Cousin Danica...
-Okay, I guess we're
talking again.

10:49.465 --> 10:50.631
Go on, son.

10:50.725 --> 10:53.134
There's something I need
to tell you, as family.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.244
It's a secret that's been
weighing on me

10:55.246 --> 10:57.380
ever since I met you
an hour ago.

10:57.399 --> 10:59.658
It's just that, Cousin Danica,

10:59.826 --> 11:01.809
you should know that I am...

11:01.828 --> 11:04.220
OFFICER:
Danica Tobin, come out
with your hands up.

11:04.239 --> 11:06.072
-Oh, no.
-(clears throat) ...gay.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.000
Well, I guess I ought
to tell you all the truth

11:09.152 --> 11:10.669
about who I really am.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.061
Actually,
that's what I was doing.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.246
If you could just wait a second

11:13.340 --> 11:14.839
while I tell you
who I really am.

11:14.991 --> 11:16.991
That's the reason
why we're here.

11:17.085 --> 11:20.236
I am wanted by the police
for crimes.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.238
-(all gasp)
-I simply can't believe it.

11:22.257 --> 11:24.516
-I'm shocked.
-Did my shoes pop off?

11:24.667 --> 11:26.685
Thank you for sharing
your truth with us, Danica.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.561
That was very brave.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.142
So, here's what
I think we should do.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.768
I'll open the door
to talk to the policewoman,

11:35.921 --> 11:37.587
and you guys tell her
that you got here last night.

11:37.605 --> 11:38.922
You know, like an alibi.

11:39.015 --> 11:40.014
Oh, and if they ask you why

11:40.108 --> 11:41.424
you didn't bring
any luggage with you,

11:41.517 --> 11:43.350
you'll just say,
"Because we're disgusting.

11:43.445 --> 11:45.945
We wear the same underwear
all the time, every day." Okay?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.431
As much as we would love to lie
to the authorities

11:48.600 --> 11:50.875
on your behalf,
I don't think we will.

11:51.102 --> 11:52.877
It's probably time
for us to get going.

11:52.954 --> 11:54.787
-(Ham gasps)
-I hate to do this, Beef,

11:54.940 --> 11:56.030
but you're not going anywhere.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.865
Except to the cellar,
as my hostages.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.884
At first, I was like,
"Her vibe is off,"

12:00.111 --> 12:02.445
but now I'm like,
"Her vibe is way off."

12:02.464 --> 12:04.948
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> If we want to solve</i>
<i> the Orca Bay Slicer case,</i>

12:04.966 --> 12:06.924
we need to think inside the bun,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.785
by eating some hot dogs
she might have eaten.

12:08.954 --> 12:11.396
Or tossed in her victims'
crotches as a calling card.

12:11.623 --> 12:15.233
Oh, yeah. Our perp definitely
spent some time here.

12:15.310 --> 12:16.901
This place is creep city.

12:17.053 --> 12:18.978
I'll grab us a table
while you go order us

12:19.130 --> 12:20.721
some research hot dogs--
for research.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.815
(with accent):
As I sat in my booth
at The Sausage Lynx,

12:22.968 --> 12:25.577
I couldn't help but wonder, did
the Orca Bay Slicer sit here?

12:25.804 --> 12:28.229
And if so, did she order
the Greek Goddess Dog

12:28.306 --> 12:30.248
with kalamata olives
and feta cheese?

12:30.399 --> 12:32.642
(regular accent):
Wolf, make sure to get
the Greek Goddess Dog.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.644
-I got to know if it's good.
-Ten-four. Hello.

12:34.662 --> 12:36.813
Could we please have
two Greek Goddess Dogs

12:36.831 --> 12:38.331
and four
Hot Dog the Yummy Hunters?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.832
That'll be $28.64.

12:39.985 --> 12:43.336
So, uh, we're here investigating
the Orca Bay Slicer case.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.579
You ever sell a hot dog
to a murderer?

12:45.673 --> 12:46.765
I don't know. Maybe.

12:46.992 --> 12:48.174
Was it a woman?
And was she clutching

12:48.326 --> 12:49.583
a gigantic kitchen knife
and saying,

12:49.603 --> 12:51.252
"He's gonna get it"?
Anything like that?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.605
No, but we had someone abuse
the mustard station once.

12:53.832 --> 12:55.923
That's why we keep the packets
behind the counter now.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.925
Are you, by any chance,
the Orca Bay Slicer?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.760
-No.
-Worth a shot.

12:59.854 --> 13:01.595
Oh, are you related
to Danica Tobin?

13:01.615 --> 13:04.765
Now, don't touch anything
or move anything around.

13:04.859 --> 13:06.676
You can look at the TV,
but don't change the channel.

13:06.694 --> 13:08.678
Or you can look at
the adult coloring books,

13:08.847 --> 13:10.029
but don't color in them.

13:10.106 --> 13:11.848
Place your phones
in this Longaberger basket,

13:11.866 --> 13:13.124
and I'll be on my way.

13:13.276 --> 13:15.126
(grunts) Gently.
Don't hurt the basket.

13:15.278 --> 13:17.036
Please, Danica, just let us go.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.855
Well, you could've
given me an alibi,

13:18.857 --> 13:20.206
so this is all your own fault.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.966
And those pillow covers are new.

13:22.193 --> 13:25.862
Do not unzip and pee in them
like I'm sure you do at home.

13:25.955 --> 13:27.213
I'm sorry you didn't get
to come out

13:27.365 --> 13:28.289
to your murderer cousin, Ham.

13:28.383 --> 13:29.882
First, I didn't get to come out,

13:30.035 --> 13:32.293
and now we're probably
gonna die in this basement.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.978
What else could happen? Ugh.

13:34.205 --> 13:37.464
All of<i> Peaceful Outdoor Bathtubs</i>
is already colored in?

13:37.559 --> 13:39.984
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i>Well, Sherlock Hold-up-a-minute.</i>

13:40.136 --> 13:42.469
Not only am I related
to Danica Tobin

13:42.638 --> 13:45.064
but we're going to visit her
right after this.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.050
Honeybee,
this lady knows Cousin Danica.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.309
(chuckles)
What are the chances?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.144
Yeah, what are the chances?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.979
How do you know her?
Is she a hot dog freak?

13:52.057 --> 13:53.981
She used to work here,
but then she started

13:54.000 --> 13:55.074
really annoying the manager,
Bradley.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.650
She also used to picket
the restaurant

13:56.728 --> 13:58.169
during her lunch breaks
'cause she thought

13:58.396 --> 13:59.745
the hot dogs looked
too much like penises.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.990
Anyway, he fired her,
and she did not take it well.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.251
Wolf, are you hearing this?
Hot dog related resentment.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.012
A vendetta against men,
or at least against Bradley.

14:08.164 --> 14:10.181
Danica just became
suspect number one.

14:10.408 --> 14:12.833
Oh, my God, Danica's
a wiener-hating murderer,

14:13.002 --> 14:15.002
and my whole family's
with her right now!

14:15.096 --> 14:16.429
This is code red!

14:16.581 --> 14:19.374
Sorry, sir.
I need to commandeer these dogs.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.674
There's no time.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.193
-Hey, Elba.
-Hey, Edna.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.770
Thanks for being my backup.
I haven't had to arrest someone

14:24.865 --> 14:27.924
since Fred Levy refused to get
out of the fountain at the mall.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.534
He was nude,
and he brought a beach chair

14:29.685 --> 14:31.427
and a battery-powered blender
for piña coladas.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.762
Part of me appreciated
his vision.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.263
I was happy to come.

14:34.398 --> 14:36.357
Fighting crime with my sister
is the thrill of a lifetime.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.785
And I promised Mom I'd take a
video of you doing police stuff.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.437
All right, here we go.

14:41.456 --> 14:43.773
Danica Tobin,
you're under arrest.

14:43.775 --> 14:45.458
Danica speaking. Hi. Hi.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.444
I have hostages,
so, you know, stay back.

14:48.463 --> 14:50.446
I haven't been in
a hostage situation

14:50.465 --> 14:52.965
since we went to Mitch Jameson's
one-man show,

14:53.059 --> 14:54.450
<i> A Dash of Mitch.</i>

14:54.469 --> 14:56.710
Ugh, yeah,
this sounds better than that.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.878
(both laughing)

14:57.972 --> 14:59.622
WOLF:
Great idea to park the car

14:59.641 --> 15:01.382
a few blocks away
and approach from the rear.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.883
I've seen enough
stakeout movies to know

15:02.903 --> 15:05.144
you got to size up the situation
before you make your move.

15:05.296 --> 15:07.296
Yep. Also, we got to finish
these hot dogs.

15:07.390 --> 15:08.722
And these french fries we got

15:08.816 --> 15:10.133
at the Hamburger Jack's
drive-through.

15:10.226 --> 15:12.076
Yeah, I feel a little guilty
about stopping again

15:12.228 --> 15:14.470
on the way here-- mm--
but I'd be no good

15:14.563 --> 15:16.230
fighting a serial killer
on an empty stomach.

15:16.324 --> 15:17.415
Don't feel guilty, babe.

15:17.566 --> 15:19.100
The Closer was always
eating snacks

15:19.160 --> 15:20.977
from her drawer as little
power-ups throughout the day,

15:20.995 --> 15:22.495
and she was the best in the biz.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.405
Oh, yeah, I just love
Kyra Sedgwick.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.666
And speaking of snacks,
her husband Kevin Bacon

15:26.760 --> 15:28.259
is pretty easy on the eyes.

15:28.486 --> 15:30.002
Oh, oh, God, she's got a gun.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.712
-Okay, don't panic.
-Tommy salami!

15:31.765 --> 15:34.581
Please spare their wieners.
We're coming, guys.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.510
Okay, this is just
a closet full of mayonnaise.

15:37.662 --> 15:39.996
-Shouldn't this be refrigerated?
-Only if they're open.

15:40.014 --> 15:41.588
Okay, but they all
seem to be open.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.500
Oh, here's something.
There's some stairs back here.

15:44.519 --> 15:46.093
Oh, and there's another door.

15:46.171 --> 15:47.353
(grunts) It's locked.

15:47.522 --> 15:49.430
Well, we could just look
at the TiVo again.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.024
She does have something on there
called<i> Frankly, Frasier.</i>

15:52.177 --> 15:53.359
Do not put that on.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.511
It's Niles doing
freeze-frame commentary

15:55.530 --> 15:57.604
over full-length episodes
of<i> Frasier.</i>

15:57.699 --> 16:00.016
<i> NILES:</i>
<i> Welcome to episode 80</i>
<i> of</i> Frankly, Frasier.

16:00.109 --> 16:02.018
<i> Today we'll be taking</i>
<i> a critical glance</i>

16:02.111 --> 16:03.944
<i> at episode 80 of</i> Frasier,

16:03.964 --> 16:06.205
<i> "Our Father</i>
<i> Whose Art Ain't Heaven."</i>

16:06.357 --> 16:07.373
What's wrong, sweetie?

16:07.525 --> 16:09.450
-You love<i> Frasier.</i>
-I know.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.544
What's wrong is I brought
my whole family here

16:11.696 --> 16:13.713
so I could redo my coming-out,
'cause I thought

16:13.865 --> 16:15.548
having some big,
gasp-filled moment

16:15.642 --> 16:16.957
seemed so important to me,

16:16.977 --> 16:18.868
but I'm realizing
I don't want that.

16:18.961 --> 16:21.887
That was just some weird idea
that snuck into my brain basket

16:21.982 --> 16:24.707
after years of watching movies
like<i> Danny Vroom.</i>

16:24.726 --> 16:27.819
It doesn't have to be dramatic
or full of conflict.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.879
It can actually just be
full of support.

16:29.897 --> 16:31.547
But it's too late now.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.883
Now we're gonna
have to eat mayonnaise

16:33.976 --> 16:35.976
in a basement until we get shot!

16:36.070 --> 16:38.404
Honeybee,
I can hear them down here.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.406
If you can hear me, guys,
it's me, Wolf,

16:40.500 --> 16:41.724
your brother and son,

16:41.743 --> 16:43.334
and in the case of Crispin,
closest friend.

16:43.561 --> 16:45.003
We are here
to save your penises.

16:45.230 --> 16:46.729
-JUDY: Wolf!
-We hear you, Judy.

16:46.822 --> 16:47.913
Not so fast.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.674
You must be Wolf and Honeybee.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.083
And you must be Danica.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.251
So nice to meet you.

16:52.403 --> 16:53.736
Lay down, on your tummies.

16:53.829 --> 16:55.829
Okay, I do not like
a grown woman saying "tummy."

16:55.998 --> 16:57.256
-It's weird.
-Tummies on the turf!

16:57.408 --> 16:59.392
-Ugh.
-Nancy Drew Magoo!

17:02.355 --> 17:05.672
Okay, when I say so,
I want you both to stand up,

17:05.841 --> 17:07.416
-and I'm gonna put you
in the basement.
-And slice off our wieners?

17:07.585 --> 17:10.010
I don't like that kind
of rude language.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.031
-Freeze! Police.
-That was amazing.

17:13.182 --> 17:14.681
Man, I wish Mom could be here.

17:14.759 --> 17:17.035
Uh-oh. Is that a...
Yeah, that's a gun.

17:17.186 --> 17:18.427
She's got a gun.

17:18.446 --> 17:20.263
Wait, you guys don't have guns?

17:20.281 --> 17:22.373
All right, you two,
also down on the ground.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.433
Ah, looks like
we got to surrender, sis.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.377
Don't surrender.
You're the police.

17:26.529 --> 17:28.695
Sorry, but we leave our guns
in the glovebox,

17:28.823 --> 17:30.289
like we're supposed to.

17:30.441 --> 17:31.941
Oh, yeah.
I haven't handled a gun

17:32.034 --> 17:33.442
since the gun-training puppet
taught me

17:33.461 --> 17:34.627
how to take off the safety.

17:34.796 --> 17:36.995
Ya beep, and ya boop,
and you're ready to shoot.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.115
But only if it's
a life-or-death situation.

17:39.133 --> 17:40.633
I'm not even interested
in killing you guys,

17:40.727 --> 17:42.393
but you're kind of
leaving me no choice here.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.121
What I am interested in
is those haircuts.

17:45.123 --> 17:47.214
Did you lose a bet,
or are you just very brave?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.549
I can't believe I'm saying this,

17:48.643 --> 17:50.459
but can you be nice
to these police ladies?

17:50.553 --> 17:52.144
-You suck.
-Shh! It's too much talking.

17:52.297 --> 17:55.481
Kesha's cursed Kit Kat,
I don't want to die young.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.057
What are you...
what are you doing?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.968
Sorry, sorry,
I'm not trying to get away.

17:59.061 --> 18:00.653
I just have major
pins and needles. Ugh.

18:00.805 --> 18:03.639
Stop moving in that annoying way
and get back down on the ground.

18:03.732 --> 18:04.749
Hmm?

18:04.900 --> 18:06.309
-Gotcha.
-Aah!

18:06.327 --> 18:08.569
Great job, sis.
A classic tap and turn.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.755
Yeah, I was gonna do "there's
something on your shirt,"

18:10.982 --> 18:12.331
but it just doesn't seem like

18:12.483 --> 18:14.241
this lady eats
anything with sauce.

18:14.335 --> 18:16.243
Ugh, well, darn it all,
you really did get me.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.763
I did not see that coming,
and not only because I was

18:18.914 --> 18:20.656
sort of looking away because
I find your face unpleasant.

18:20.675 --> 18:23.159
You know what else
you might find unpleasant?

18:23.252 --> 18:25.269
Three years at the
Orca Bay Correctional Facility.

18:25.496 --> 18:27.254
Actually, it's very comfortable.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.181
They have a Wetzel's Pretzels
in the cafeteria.

18:29.334 --> 18:31.183
So, you guys are positive

18:31.336 --> 18:33.185
Cousin Danica isn't
the Orca Bay Slicer?

18:33.338 --> 18:36.597
Sorry, the Orca Bay Slicer
confessed many years ago.

18:36.691 --> 18:38.023
Was kind of a big deal.

18:38.176 --> 18:40.618
And she prefers to be called
Nancy McCamden now.

18:40.769 --> 18:43.604
Well, Crap-lombo, looks like
we didn't finish reading

18:43.623 --> 18:45.531
the Wikipedia page, Honeybee.
(laughs)

18:45.683 --> 18:47.291
We must have gotten
a little too excited

18:47.443 --> 18:48.793
and forgotten to scroll
all the way down.

18:48.944 --> 18:50.035
Don't worry, though.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.188
I'm sure A.J. Dossier
accidentally investigated

18:52.281 --> 18:54.540
a bunch of closed cases
at the beginning of his career.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.616
Onwards!

18:55.784 --> 18:57.135
Wait, so what did
Cousin Danica do?

18:57.286 --> 19:00.120
-She robbed a bunch of banks.
-But I had a good reason.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.214
Well, as long as you had
a good reason.

19:02.367 --> 19:03.808
Well, I did for the first one.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.868
I'd gotten fired
by a hot dog restaurant,

19:05.961 --> 19:07.870
and my home was about
to be foreclosed on.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.705
The second time,
it was because I was bored.

19:09.724 --> 19:12.875
And after that, I just,
eh, caught the bug.

19:12.968 --> 19:14.485
All right, off I go to jail.

19:14.712 --> 19:17.396
HAM:
Guys, I'm really sorry
about today.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.972
We only ended up here
because I thought

19:19.066 --> 19:20.549
I wanted a big,
dramatic coming-out,

19:20.568 --> 19:22.234
and then look at
all the real-life drama

19:22.387 --> 19:23.602
I accidentally got us into.

19:23.754 --> 19:25.738
Funny, as I was preparing
for possible death,

19:25.890 --> 19:27.223
I realized something.

19:27.241 --> 19:30.075
I've already had
the perfect kind of coming-out.

19:30.228 --> 19:31.410
(chuckles) Many times.

19:31.562 --> 19:33.579
The kind that didn't faze
my family.

19:33.731 --> 19:34.988
Not even a little bit.

19:35.082 --> 19:37.249
Ham, I'm sorry that I never made
a bigger moment

19:37.326 --> 19:40.069
out of what was admittedly
a very big moment.

19:40.087 --> 19:41.662
If I ever seemed too casual,

19:41.756 --> 19:44.240
it's just because I was afraid
of making it seem

19:44.242 --> 19:46.242
like a big deal
in a negative way.

19:46.260 --> 19:47.927
I can't go back in time, son,

19:48.079 --> 19:50.980
but maybe we can
make it up to you.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.418
-Places, people.
-(Beef giggles)

19:55.436 --> 19:57.603
Good evening, esteemed family.
