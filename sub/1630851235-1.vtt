WEBVTT

01:44.234 --> 01:45.627
- Okay, who's hungry?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.981
The little ones first.
Whoa, boy.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.766
- HANK &

01:54.810 --> 01:56.420
-You understand me?!

02:21.228 --> 02:22.359
Mornin' you.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.709
Mwah!

02:24.753 --> 02:26.146
Hey.

02:27.756 --> 02:31.673
Do you...wanna meet
your great great great--

02:31.716 --> 02:33.022
- Meemaw?

02:33.065 --> 02:35.024
- You know she's gonna
turn 100 this summer.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.243
- That isn't true.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.983
- She is so old, she
was born before TV.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.681
- No one was born before TV.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.205
- Mm-hmm, before cars.
Before horses.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.990
Maybe even before
the trees themselves.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.514
You wanna ask her yourself?

02:46.557 --> 02:49.169
- Really?

02:49.212 --> 02:51.258
- I was aimin' for
it to be a surprise.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.360
You and I have never
taken a trip together.

03:06.403 --> 03:09.624
So, we'll get the bus in Cordia
and we'll zip on over to Joplin,

03:09.667 --> 03:12.366
and then we'll catch a Greyhound
to Minnesota from there.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.020
- How long does the bus take
to get to Minnesota from here?

03:15.064 --> 03:18.241
- I don't know, nearly 14 hours.
Maybe longer.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.809
Everything just takes
longer on the bus.

03:20.852 --> 03:24.900
But, it is past time that
you met your up north people.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.423
- What about Dad?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.077
- Do you think anything can
happen in this house that

03:28.120 --> 03:29.426
he doesn't already know about?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.733
- Don't have to pack?
- Already done.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.083
I packed for both of us.
So, come on!

03:34.126 --> 03:35.737
Let's get a hurry up shoes!

03:35.780 --> 03:38.435
- What about your garden?
- Don't you worry about it.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.655
Mother Earth has a way of
takin' care of her own kind.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.265
So let's get to gettin'!

03:55.931 --> 03:57.672
- Connor, you
the reinforcements?

03:59.151 --> 04:00.501
- Impartial observer.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.155
- Where you off to, Bloom?
Hm?

04:03.199 --> 04:06.724
You can't take him.
That's my boy.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.639
- I'm doing things my way now.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.120
Jack doesn't have to go anywhere
he doesn't already wanna go.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.687
- Oh my god,
I am sick to death of

04:12.730 --> 04:15.646
your hippy-dippy
tree-huggin' bullshit.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.952
Well, you--
you wanna take him up

04:16.995 --> 04:18.867
to meet the rest of
your fucked-up family?

04:18.910 --> 04:22.653
No, absolutely not.
He's staying here with me.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.395
You wanna go? Go right ahead.

04:25.439 --> 04:28.268
But I thought I got you away
from that goddamn nonsense.

04:28.311 --> 04:31.793
- Obviously my first mistake.

04:31.836 --> 04:35.623
- Oh, Bloom. Jack is
never gonna become a man--

04:35.666 --> 04:37.189
- Oh, you are some kind of man?

04:37.233 --> 04:39.322
With all the separatist
survival bullshit?

04:39.366 --> 04:41.803
You are nothing but
a two-bit terrorist.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.415
Did you hear her?

04:45.459 --> 04:47.330
- Mm-hmm.
- Fucking terrorist?

04:47.374 --> 04:48.810
Oh, I get it! I get it!

04:48.853 --> 04:51.639
This is the part where
you call me a Nazi again.

04:51.682 --> 04:52.944
- Get out of my way.

04:52.988 --> 04:56.383
- Go ahead, Bloom.
You just keep pushing me.

04:56.426 --> 04:59.124
Keep it up, 'cuz I'm all the
way done takin' it, you hear me?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.524
- What do we have here? What?

05:14.183 --> 05:16.054
- I didn't do any--
-I was halfway to Wichita

05:16.098 --> 05:17.795
when I realized
I didn't have this.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.797
That's why I turned around.
- That is a lie.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.973
You planted it along
with that fuckin' bottle.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.192
Well played!

05:23.235 --> 05:24.454
- Come on, save it
for Rudy Spaulding.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.369
The chief is waitin' for you!

05:26.413 --> 05:28.545
I'm makin' a citizen's
arrest, you hear me?

05:28.589 --> 05:29.546
-Dad.
- Huh?

05:29.590 --> 05:30.678
- Hey!

05:30.721 --> 05:32.070
- You better stay
out of this, kid.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.811
- Honey, don't. It's okay.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.117
- Come on.
-Beth.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.989
Beth, you see to it that
Jack is taken care of.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.905
Don't leave him alone
and I will be back soon!

05:40.949 --> 05:42.603
I will get a lawyer
and I'm gonna give--

05:44.169 --> 05:46.868
- Who the fuck do you think
they're gonna listen to?!

05:46.911 --> 05:49.740
You? A fuckin' drunk
with an arrest record

05:49.784 --> 05:51.481
and a history
of mental illness?

05:51.525 --> 05:54.615
Or me, a decorated
former Marine, huh?

05:59.489 --> 06:00.751
- You come now, Jack.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.797
We're gonna get your
mom the help she needs.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.818
- You know how
this goes, sweetie.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.908
This ain't the
first time nor the last.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.258
You've got to
wait out the storm.

06:29.301 --> 06:34.176
Your mom's tough.
It ain't no thing to her.

06:34.219 --> 06:38.180
- I haven't seen her touch a
bottle in god knows how long.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.486
- Why don't
we just find something

06:39.529 --> 06:41.531
to take your
mind off things? Hm?

06:41.575 --> 06:43.141
I'm sure it'll all work out.

06:43.185 --> 06:46.754
- Beth, you don't understand.
He was gonna hit her. Again!

06:46.797 --> 06:48.320
And I just stood there.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.887
You're saying
wait out the storm

06:49.931 --> 06:51.672
and then things
will go back to normal.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.717
But then there's just gonna
be another storm, and another.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.153
It's just who he is!

06:55.197 --> 07:00.594
- Your dad, he's complicated.
Let's just say that.

07:00.637 --> 07:03.510
Once your mom's better,
you'll be a family again.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.097
- You got a plan as to how
you're gonna explain this

07:26.141 --> 07:27.838
to young Jack, I presume.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.974
- There was a--a
struggle in the car.

07:33.017 --> 07:37.935
And she pulled away from
me and the door was open.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.197
The next thing I knew,

07:39.241 --> 07:40.677
she was going end over end
in the street.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.550
The damn woman jumped.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.334
- That's the story?

07:45.377 --> 07:47.902
- Yup.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.556
- It didn't have to go this way.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.255
What's right is right.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.475
- It's too late to sing
that song, ain't it?

08:04.658 --> 08:06.486
- Any word?
-Not yet.

08:09.837 --> 08:13.188
I think I'll just stay here
'til your dad gets back.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.495
- Okay.
I just hope Mom's okay.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.854
- Mom!
- No, Jack. Jack, it's me.

09:13.509 --> 09:16.730
It's just a bad dream.
It's okay.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.212
It's okay.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.695
Go back to sleep, all right?

10:14.570 --> 10:15.876
- Aah!

10:17.138 --> 10:19.923
Aw, fuck.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.143
- She really did love
this garden of hers.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.972
- Yeah. But you know what?

10:25.015 --> 10:27.148
It's completely legal
to keep her on my land.

10:27.191 --> 10:30.020
Another thing I
love about Kansas.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.675
Save the planet, fertilize it.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.176
-What do you got there?

10:56.960 --> 11:00.094
- Seeds. I think Mom
wanted to take them to Meemaw.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.573
- Oh yeah?

11:03.097 --> 11:04.533
Let's see.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.015
- I wanna plant them.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.756
Give her something
nice to come home to.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.454
- Aww. You are a darlin'.

11:16.588 --> 11:19.287
It's a new day.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.290
I always loved
working in the soil.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.467
Something your mom and I shared.

11:25.510 --> 11:31.212
The fact that you can plant
anything--a seed, an idea.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.692
Heck, you can even
plant evidence

11:32.735 --> 11:33.997
to throw someone
off the track.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.310
- Hey.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.706
Jack.
- Dad.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.800
- Everything okay?

11:56.063 --> 11:58.152
Look here, it's--
it's really unfortunate

11:58.195 --> 12:00.154
that you had to see that
yesterday.

12:00.197 --> 12:04.114
But you need to understand
it--it's probably for the best.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.725
- Is she coming back?

12:11.818 --> 12:15.517
- No. No, not anytime soon.

12:15.560 --> 12:20.652
Jack, do you understand why
your mother wanted to leave?

12:20.696 --> 12:21.871
She wanted to go someplace

12:21.915 --> 12:25.309
that she could drink
and take her pills.

12:25.353 --> 12:29.183
And you need to
understand--look at me.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.662
You need to understand that

12:30.706 --> 12:34.318
she would've eventually
chosen those things over you.

12:34.362 --> 12:37.844
Yes, yes, you need to
understand that, Jack.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.020
You--at the police station,

12:40.063 --> 12:42.065
she--she had a complete
breakdown.

12:42.109 --> 12:45.025
I mean, it was--it
was heartbreaking.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.853
I mean,
it was heartbreaking.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.506
But, you know,
thank the Lord Jesus

12:48.550 --> 12:50.465
she's in the
halfway house right now.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.293
She's getting the help
that she needs.

12:52.336 --> 12:56.253
So all that
we can do is wait

12:56.297 --> 12:59.039
and--and--and
see what happens, okay?

12:59.082 --> 13:02.520
But you gotta stand tall.
Stand tall.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.566
There you go.
Good, be strong.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.498
- Ow!

13:23.541 --> 13:24.847
-What are
you doing, Jack?

13:24.891 --> 13:28.024
You wanna water 'em,
not bleed all over 'em.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.896
-How long until
you think they'll sprout?

13:29.939 --> 13:32.028
-I don't know.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.856
"Lettuce" consider.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.728
Do you "carrot" on how long?

13:36.772 --> 13:39.993
- I guess "weed" better
get a move on, then.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.822
- Now you're just
beatin' around the bush.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.875
- All right, so, easiest way
to get in and get a pass,

13:52.919 --> 13:55.573
you come in on first.
You park on A1.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.662
You leave your keys in it.
Then you walk.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.754
- ATF is on the top floor.

14:02.798 --> 14:07.281
- Yeah, and there's also an IRS
office on four, same building.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.761
It's small, but...you know,

14:09.805 --> 14:12.460
it's like a little
extra somethin' special.

14:12.503 --> 14:15.898
Like a cherry on
top of a sundae--tasty.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.683
- Oh, man.
Can you imagine this, Hank?

14:18.727 --> 14:22.165
It's gonna be just pieces
fallin' three states away.

14:22.209 --> 14:25.255
It's gonna be rainin'
chunks, man. Chunks.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.735
-There'll be
chunks of them in orbit.

14:33.611 --> 14:34.786
-Has Jack
read the book?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.005
-- He will.
-- It's important.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.747
-I know it is.
I shit you not, he will.

14:38.790 --> 14:43.621
What we're--what we're
doin', this isn't new.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.363
Secessionism is not new.

14:46.407 --> 14:50.411
Confederacy ain't new. No.

14:50.454 --> 14:53.240
We're in the vanguard, man.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.851
-I'm an American.
- Damn straight, y'all.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.812
- How is this possible?

15:43.855 --> 15:46.771
Mom, your garden.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.426
It's--it's grown.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.959
I wish you could see this.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.526
The flowers remind me of...you.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.411
-Jack is never
gonna become a man.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.674
Who the fuck do you think
they're gonna listen to?

16:19.717 --> 16:22.633
You or me?

16:22.677 --> 16:25.375
You better stay
out of this, kid.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.117
-Is she coming back?

16:28.161 --> 16:29.901
-No.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.739
-I'm sorry, Mom.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.010
I miss you.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.360
-She doesn't
just love you.

16:53.403 --> 16:56.972
She loves me, too.
More than I ever deserved.

16:57.016 --> 17:01.890
- No, that isn't true.
- It is.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.762
I was afraid she couldn't
be out there on her own.

17:04.806 --> 17:08.244
Not with all that rotten stuff
bangin' around inside her head.

17:08.288 --> 17:11.291
- Don't be sad, Beth.
She'll be back soon.

17:15.991 --> 17:20.126
- Besides, you
helped with the flowers.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.563
You've shown her just
how much you love her,

17:22.606 --> 17:25.392
just by planting them with me.

17:25.435 --> 17:28.395
Nothing says I love you
better than flowers.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.414
- Quit your fucking daydreaming.
You got chores to do.

17:47.457 --> 17:50.112
The pigs need their dinner.
Don't wait up for me.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.114
I don't know how
late I'll be back.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.342
- Yes, sir.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.083
-I wish it was
happening tomorrow.

18:04.126 --> 18:07.303
- The ATF is saying
the meeting is in October.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.652
It's plenty soon enough.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.872
-If we still
have 'til October.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.091
If she hadn't told anybody--

18:12.134 --> 18:13.483
-She didn't
tell anyone, Connor.

18:13.527 --> 18:14.745
-You can't
be sure about that.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.748
- But I am. I am sure.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.099
Because Beth got everything
that she knew out of her

18:20.142 --> 18:23.798
when she called and told me
she was taking Jack away.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.148
Damn good on you, Beth.
No, Bloom knew.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.063
She knew exactly
what would happen

18:28.107 --> 18:29.760
if we ever got raided
by the feds.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.981
She knew that would be like
puttin' a gun against her head.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.417
Because I told her.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.898
I told her myself that
I would put her in the ground

18:36.941 --> 18:39.466
if the law ever came on my land.

18:39.509 --> 18:42.904
No, she was crazy, Connor.
But she wasn't fucking stupid.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.520
- All right.
-Tomorrow.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.131
- Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.401
- Thank the good maker
for women like you, Beth.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.631
- Beth.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.416
Take good care
of my boy, all right?

19:16.459 --> 19:18.244
-All right, I will.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.767
- I know you will.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.883
- It's okay, it's okay.
Calm down.

19:48.926 --> 19:52.234
Come on! Come on!

19:52.278 --> 19:53.670
Oh!

19:58.240 --> 19:59.372
- Huh?

20:07.858 --> 20:09.208
- Aah!

20:27.574 --> 20:31.969
Aah! Ow! Aah!

21:05.568 --> 21:07.178
- Beth! Beth! Come quick!

21:07.222 --> 21:08.745
I need you to help.
I did something stupid.

21:08.789 --> 21:09.964
-Jack, you're bleedin'.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.182
We gotta do something
about that arm.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.749
- No, no, no.
Beth, I need your help.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.448
Please, come quick, please!
- Okay, okay, of course I will.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.495
- Come on.

21:33.074 --> 21:36.251
- Jack, I don't see anything.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.513
What are you playing?

21:50.613 --> 21:52.702
- What the crap is
all this horse pockey?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.791
Hey, Jack!

21:54.835 --> 21:56.619
Jack, you in there?
You asleep?

22:00.623 --> 22:03.496
What, you run away,
you little shaved tail?

22:03.539 --> 22:05.193
Jack!

22:11.417 --> 22:12.592
-I'm right here.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.595
-Oh! What, you runnin'

22:15.638 --> 22:17.858
a spook house in here
tonight or somethin', Jack?

22:17.901 --> 22:19.207
- Dad.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.385
- What happened?

22:23.429 --> 22:26.040
- I--I did something bad.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.912
I did something
really, really bad.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.958
- What did you do?

22:31.001 --> 22:33.352
- I need help.
I need your help, Dad!

22:33.395 --> 22:37.747
- Goddamn it all to hell.
What?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.401
- You have to come see.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.927
- I didn't mean to find it.
- What?

22:43.971 --> 22:47.670
- In the bushes.
I--I didn't mean it.

22:47.714 --> 22:50.543
- Okay, Jack.
Jack, listen to me.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.284
Whatever it is that you
think you saw out here,

22:53.328 --> 22:56.505
it's not--I can explain, okay?

23:00.204 --> 23:05.035
Oh my god. Beth. Hey, hey.

23:11.694 --> 23:17.265
Jack, no, no, no! Oh!
Oh, you stupid fucking kid.

23:25.969 --> 23:29.233
-What the fuck is this?
Let go!

23:29.277 --> 23:33.150
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

23:44.814 --> 23:46.076
- Hey, Connor.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.251
Dad says get
over here double quick.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.209
-What's this about?

23:48.252 --> 23:49.776
- About a bag, I
don't know what.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.386
He said you know.
And hurry, okay?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.735
-All right,
all right, I'm comin'.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.066
-Mom said Meemaw's
going to turn 100 this summer.

24:19.109 --> 24:22.286
I'm glad I'm going
to finally meet her.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.201
Never met someone older than TV.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.862
- Earth to Trinice!

25:17.690 --> 25:19.082
- Sorry.

25:19.126 --> 25:22.477
Regina's voice is just
like...so hypnotic.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.958
- You're actually watching
that video again?

25:25.001 --> 25:26.481
You're, like, fucking obsessed.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.527
- Hey! I gotta support my queen.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.485
- Oh god, can you even
hear yourself right now?

25:30.529 --> 25:33.967
- Look, it's hard work
being Regina's number-one fan.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.578
- Are you kidding?
All right, get in line.

25:36.622 --> 25:40.060
You haven't even seen her live.
I am her number-one fan.

25:40.103 --> 25:41.844
- I would
have seen her live

25:41.888 --> 25:44.020
if you would've gotten me
an extra ticket.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.195
- Mm, that sounds like something

25:45.239 --> 25:47.546
Regina's number-two fan
would say.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.723
- Whatever. You were sitting
in the nosebleeds, anyway.

25:50.766 --> 25:54.378
- Um, uh, you just
don't get it, all right?

25:54.422 --> 25:58.339
Seeing her in concert,
it changes you.

25:58.382 --> 26:01.168
Like, recordings don't
even do her justice.

26:01.211 --> 26:04.737
Hearing her live, it's
like on a whole other level.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.609
- That booty's on a whole
'nother level, goddamn.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.046
Those curves are, like, inhuman.

26:10.090 --> 26:13.049
- You know she's like nine
months pregnant, right?

26:13.093 --> 26:14.703
- Yeah, I'd still hit that.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.705
-Oh my gosh, gross!

26:16.749 --> 26:18.446
Can you try to blow
that out the window?

26:18.489 --> 26:20.056
What if my mom smells it?

26:20.100 --> 26:22.537
- Isn't she at work?
- DEBORAH'Deborah?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.147
- Why didn't you tell
us your mom was home?

26:24.191 --> 26:26.802
- Her shift got
canceled last minute.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.935
It's not my fault that
Regina went into labor.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.850
-What?

26:33.243 --> 26:35.115
- Hey, hon.

26:35.158 --> 26:36.899
Smells like you guys
might be hungry.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.161
Want me to make some dinner?

26:38.205 --> 26:40.642
- Um, no, that's okay.
We're--we're good.

26:40.686 --> 26:41.904
- I'm gonna go to bed soon.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.515
- Oh, we can have leftovers.
- Yeah.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.256
- Come on, no one
likes a cold meal.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.345
- Mom!

26:48.389 --> 26:52.175
- Well, here's my wallet if
you wanna order some pizzas.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.271
- Okay, what did you
say about Regina?

27:01.315 --> 27:02.577
- Nothing.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.101
- No, you said she was
having her baby tonight.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.886
- My mom will kill me if
anybody else finds out.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.888
- Oh, come on!
- Tell us everything.

27:08.931 --> 27:11.542
Or, I'll post a rumor and
I'll tag your mom, too.

27:11.586 --> 27:14.589
- Okay, fine! All right?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.417
My mom had to go home
because Regina's, like,

27:16.460 --> 27:18.549
shutting down the entire
fourth floor of the hospital.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.464
She's bringing in her
own doctors and stuff.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.815
-Hey, why would
she do all that?

27:22.858 --> 27:24.686
- Privacy, duh!

27:24.730 --> 27:28.734
Everyone on planet Earth
wants to see Regina's baby.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.605
- Wait, can you imagine
how much money we'd get

27:30.649 --> 27:32.172
for a picture of that kid?

27:32.215 --> 27:34.043
- If she wants to take a
picture, she'll do it herself.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.871
We should respect her privacy.

27:35.915 --> 27:38.134
- Oh, please. She's a superstar.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.614
That basically makes
her public property,

27:39.658 --> 27:41.921
like a national park or Denny's.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.532
- No, Deborah's right.

27:44.575 --> 27:47.970
This is a beautiful moment
between a mother and her child.

27:48.014 --> 27:52.148
It should be private.
Just Regina and her staff...

27:52.192 --> 27:54.890
and her three biggest fans!

27:54.934 --> 27:56.587
- Are you insane?

27:56.631 --> 27:58.546
- Debs, we should be there
to share this moment.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.508
- Come on, I thought
you were Regina's--

28:04.552 --> 28:05.814
- TRINICE &
- -number-one fan!

28:05.858 --> 28:08.077
- Don't ever question my
loyalty to Team Regina.

28:08.121 --> 28:11.864
- All right! But,
how are we gonna get in?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.697
- Backstage pass!

28:18.740 --> 28:20.655
- Yes!

28:20.699 --> 28:22.875
- And we can split the money
from the pictures three ways.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.006
-No pictures!

28:24.050 --> 28:26.182
- Okay, fine.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.580
- Deborah's mom is totally fine
with us spending the night.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.799
-Well, are
you gonna be good?

28:33.842 --> 28:36.236
- Yeah, don't worry.
We'll be fine.

28:36.279 --> 28:38.325
-Yeah, that's
what you always say.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.500
- I gotta go, Mom.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.849
-You better be good.
- Yeah.

28:40.893 --> 28:43.417
-Love you, sweetie.
- Love you too!

28:43.460 --> 28:44.635
Bye!
-Bye!

28:45.941 --> 28:47.769
- God, it's like she
doesn't even trust me.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.771
- Did you mention you were
breaking into a hospital?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.817
- Okay, we're not breaking in.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.645
We have a key.

28:54.689 --> 28:58.693
- Oh my god, I will totally bug
out if I get to meet Regina!

28:58.737 --> 29:00.042
- I wonder who the father is.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.348
Do you think that
he'll be there?

29:01.391 --> 29:03.089
- Oh my god, if we
get a photo of him,

29:03.132 --> 29:06.005
we'd make so much more money.
- We said no pictures, remember?

29:06.048 --> 29:08.529
- No, Deborah said no
pictures of the baby.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.574
But the daddy's fair game.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.663
- You know what?
I bet there isn't even a father.

29:12.707 --> 29:16.015
I bet Regina is, like, the
Virgin Mary or something, like,

29:16.058 --> 29:18.669
totally divine.
- Hell yeah.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.324
She's just like us.
She don't need no man!

29:21.368 --> 29:22.717
- Yeah, girl!

29:22.761 --> 29:24.240
- Okay, there's
a difference between

29:24.284 --> 29:25.546
"don't need" and "can't get."

29:25.589 --> 29:27.156
-Breaking news.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.897
This one's for Regina.
- Shut up. Hey, listen, listen!

29:28.941 --> 29:31.813
-Rumors are buzzing online
that Regina is about to go into

29:31.857 --> 29:36.252
labor and has been rushed
to an undisclosed location.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.819
That's right!

29:37.863 --> 29:41.823
The queen is about to give
birth, if only we knew where.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.346
- Oh, we know.

29:43.390 --> 29:47.002
- Hell yeah.
We're comin' Regina!

29:47.046 --> 29:48.395
-Wishing her the best.

29:48.438 --> 29:51.833
Here is Regina's latest
hit, "Hungry for You."

30:04.715 --> 30:06.674
- How are we supposed
to get past that camera?

30:06.717 --> 30:08.458
- Trinice, do you have
your selfie stick?

30:08.502 --> 30:10.678
- Ding! Duh!
- Cool.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.843
- Come on, come on, come on!
Hurry!

30:44.886 --> 30:46.670
- Come on.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.324
- Okay.

30:55.723 --> 30:58.334
-This must be it.
Swipe your card, Deborah.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.466
- I don't know, guys.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.424
Maybe we should give
her her privacy.

31:01.468 --> 31:06.081
- Sounds like a certain fan is
getting bumped to number two.

31:19.007 --> 31:22.489
- Oh my god, it's Regina!

31:23.707 --> 31:26.667
-Hey!

31:26.710 --> 31:29.496
You guys shouldn't be in here.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.932
This floor's off limits.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.586
- Um, we--we were lost.

31:32.629 --> 31:33.935
- Oh really?

31:33.979 --> 31:36.329
Where'd you guys
get this key card?

31:36.372 --> 31:39.245
- Um...

31:39.288 --> 31:40.899
- Stop, you're hurting her!

31:40.942 --> 31:42.378
- Stop it! Just--
- Stop!

31:54.434 --> 31:57.611
- Oh shit.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.439
- Is he dead?

31:59.482 --> 32:01.615
- I'm not waiting to find out.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.972
- Come on, Deborah, let's go!

32:19.502 --> 32:21.374
- Hey, guys, do you hear that?

32:21.417 --> 32:22.723
- Hear what?

32:22.766 --> 32:24.333
- You dork, you still
have your earbuds.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.422
- Oh. Duh.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.687
- Probably just like an
electrical hum or something.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.428
- Then why are all the
lights turned off?

32:32.472 --> 32:33.995
- Maybe they're going green.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.302
- The elevator!

33:03.982 --> 33:06.158
- Shit. Shit.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.206
- Come on, Trinice.
We gotta bail.

33:13.121 --> 33:15.689
Deborah? Deborah?

34:28.240 --> 34:30.329
- Shh!
You wanna get us busted?

34:30.372 --> 34:32.331
- Something's wrong
with these people.

34:32.374 --> 34:34.376
Maybe Deborah was right.
We shouldn't be here.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.639
- I can't even find Deborah.
- What do you mean, you can't?

34:36.683 --> 34:38.511
- I can't.
- Guys. Guys.

34:38.554 --> 34:41.122
Oh right here, I found her!

35:03.057 --> 35:05.103
- Whoa, check this out.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.238
Creepy.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.936
- Okay.
I'm ready to leave now.

35:12.980 --> 35:16.026
-Look! There she is!

35:22.555 --> 35:25.384
-My god,
it's really her!

35:28.213 --> 35:30.476
She's having the baby
right now!

35:30.519 --> 35:32.869
Oh, guys, this is crazy!

35:32.913 --> 35:36.395
-Oh my god.

35:36.438 --> 35:40.964
We're gonna be the first people
in the world to see this!

35:41.008 --> 35:42.836
-This is so cool.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.276
- They're hurting her!

35:48.320 --> 35:52.193
- No. It's like an epidural,
right?

35:52.237 --> 35:54.152
It's supposed to
help with the pain?

36:01.202 --> 36:03.509
- Yeah, that doesn't
look like it's helping.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.607
- What's wrong with their eyes?

36:33.974 --> 36:36.498
- I told you. Something
weird is going on.

36:38.761 --> 36:42.287
- Guys, is--is that
supposed to happen?

37:12.839 --> 37:16.408
- Carlos, you idiot!
- We said no pictures!

37:16.451 --> 37:19.280
- Maybe she didn't see us.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.456
- I think she saw us!

37:21.500 --> 37:23.806
- That was her.
- What--what the hell?

37:31.684 --> 37:33.729
- Come on, guys, we gotta run!

37:38.038 --> 37:39.605
Guys?

37:52.792 --> 37:55.360
Deborah, we gotta run!

37:55.403 --> 37:57.492
Snap out of it!

37:57.536 --> 38:01.061
- Trinice?

38:01.104 --> 38:03.063
- No! Damn it!

38:05.370 --> 38:06.414
Earbuds.

38:17.556 --> 38:21.081
- Don't listen to it!
- What's happening?

38:21.124 --> 38:22.822
- They're controlling
you with that sound.

38:22.865 --> 38:26.216
Keep the cotton in your ears.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.567
- Where's Carlos?

38:35.748 --> 38:38.272
- No. No.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.626
- My queen.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.764
- No!

39:07.257 --> 39:09.434
- No!

39:15.614 --> 39:17.398
- No! No!

39:23.665 --> 39:25.145
- Oh no!

39:25.188 --> 39:28.104
- Come on, we have
to get into it!

39:40.334 --> 39:42.728
Help! Trinice!
- No!

39:45.383 --> 39:48.951
Trinice! Help! Help!

40:00.180 --> 40:02.443
- The elevator!
It's the only way out!

40:04.837 --> 40:06.360
Trinice, come on!

40:09.450 --> 40:10.495
- Fuck that.

40:23.029 --> 40:24.987
- Come on, come on!

40:25.031 --> 40:27.207
- There's no time.
We gotta hide.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.774
- It's almost here!
Come on!

41:42.717 --> 41:44.327
- Trinice.

41:55.861 --> 41:57.210
- Come on!

41:59.038 --> 42:01.562
No! No!

42:01.606 --> 42:02.911
Deborah!

42:39.644 --> 42:40.993
- Clear!

42:53.222 --> 42:54.963
- We made it.

43:00.403 --> 43:02.014
- We can use this picture to
expose Regina

43:02.057 --> 43:03.581
for the monster she is.

43:08.281 --> 43:09.891
- And destroy her career?

43:09.935 --> 43:12.241
- What the hell are you doing?
Let's get the hell out of here!

43:12.285 --> 43:15.810
- No! I bought tickets
to her next tour.

43:15.854 --> 43:17.420
- Are you crazy?

43:17.464 --> 43:20.119
We have to tell the police.

43:20.162 --> 43:23.209
- She hasn't even
finished her new album.

43:23.252 --> 43:25.515
- Didn't you see
what that thing did?

43:25.559 --> 43:26.821
It killed Carlos!

43:26.865 --> 43:28.867
- She was protecting
her privacy.

43:28.910 --> 43:30.259
- She's a monster!

43:30.303 --> 43:31.739
- She's Regina!

43:34.742 --> 43:36.875
I thought you were
her number-one fan.

43:39.225 --> 43:41.619
I guess this just proves
that you're number two.

43:44.447 --> 43:46.014
- No!

43:47.842 --> 43:49.757
Help!

44:10.865 --> 44:12.475
- No!

44:16.697 --> 44:19.178
- Help! Help!

44:19.221 --> 44:22.224
Oh, god!

44:22.268 --> 44:25.488
Help!

44:25.532 --> 44:27.490
Oh.

44:27.534 --> 44:29.449
Deborah, please!

44:31.886 --> 44:33.671
Please!

44:38.893 --> 44:40.590
-I feel really
bad about this, Trinice.

44:40.634 --> 44:41.940
Really, I do, but...

44:41.983 --> 44:45.726
I just have to
protect Regina's image.

44:45.770 --> 44:48.860
She promised me backstage
passes for life.

44:48.903 --> 44:52.254
You'd understand
if you'd seen her live.

44:52.298 --> 44:54.996
It changes you.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.650
Do you wanna meet her babies?

44:56.694 --> 44:57.869
- No!

45:00.698 --> 45:03.613
- Regina says I get to be
their nanny after school.

45:06.312 --> 45:08.880
Aren't they just the cutest?

45:08.923 --> 45:12.753
I just have to remember
to feed them one time!

45:12.797 --> 45:14.015
They've already
had their feeding,

45:14.059 --> 45:16.670
but there's just
so many of them.

45:16.714 --> 45:20.500
Oh, and I told Regina that
we could start with you.

45:20.543 --> 45:23.242
It's like my mom always says...

45:23.285 --> 45:26.245
no one likes a cold meal.

45:26.288 --> 45:29.639
No! No! No!

45:29.683 --> 45:33.078
No! No!

45:34.296 --> 45:36.908
-No! No!
