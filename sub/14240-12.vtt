00:06.700 --> 00:09.700

<i>The 21st century

00:39.700 --> 00:41.700
Gwen, I've texted you the location,

00:41.900 --> 00:44.800
we're querying four or five signs
of life, definitely non-human.

00:44.835 --> 00:47.700
- Get here as soon as you can.
- So, sure they're not Weevils?

00:47.800 --> 00:52.165
Don't think so, different energy patterns,
can't make sense of it.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.100
- Not a species we've encountered before.
- Well, let's hope they're friendly, then.

00:56.135 --> 00:58.700
Owen, lanto, take the other side of
the building, check the upper floors.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.400
Toshiko with me.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.000
Okay? Go!

01:16.900 --> 01:19.800
I'm getting mirror readings
on both floors.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.700
One creature at either
end of the building.

01:24.735 --> 01:27.500
Toshiko, split up.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.900
You know, these creatures
are very quiet.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.100
Maybe they're sleeping.

01:43.135 --> 01:45.200
Or hatching.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.200
Or maybe they aren't
creatures at all.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.500
Just explosive devices.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.600
Snap.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.800
Shit.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.400
<i>You have one message.</i>

02:33.500 --> 02:35.900
<i>Gwen, I've texted you the location,</i>

02:36.100 --> 02:38.600
<i>we're querying four or five signs
of life, definitely non-human.</i>

03:02.000 --> 03:04.100
Oh, not again.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.100
Ladies.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.300
Torso of steel, shilling a feel.

03:28.335 --> 03:30.200
Any takers?

03:32.900 --> 03:35.500
Bar fight,
got a little out of control.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.900
Flesh wound. Whoa!

03:38.200 --> 03:41.200
Whoa! Still not used to...

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200
these hangovers.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.465
Captain Jack Harkness.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.350
How long have you been there?

03:49.385 --> 03:51.165
Silent types. That's okay.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.900
I used to date a guy
with no mouth.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.100
Surprisingly creative.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.050
Listen, you only had to ask.

04:02.085 --> 04:04.500
Can we get a room though?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.300
When I said about getting a room,
I meant somewhere with linen.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.100
Time was, electrodes to the nipples
meant the start of a good night.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.865
Full power charge
and still breathing.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.100
Pretty advanced piece of
equipment you got there.

04:49.135 --> 04:52.000
You ladies are ahead
of yourselves.

04:52.035 --> 04:54.400
Now where the hell am I?

04:56.200 --> 04:58.700
Put that down before
someone gets...

05:02.600 --> 05:03.665
Why arent you dead yet?

05:03.700 --> 05:05.200
Been trying to figure that out myself.

05:05.235 --> 05:06.665
Weve been monitoring you.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.100
You've been killed 14 times
in the last six months.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.000
Feels like more than that.

05:11.035 --> 05:12.300
Whos The Doctor?

05:12.335 --> 05:13.765
No idea.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.465
"The Doctor,
he'll be able to fix me"

05:16.500 --> 05:19.800
"When The Doctor turns up,
it'll all be put right"

05:19.835 --> 05:21.965
"You wait till I see The Doctor.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.700
"First I'm going to kiss him,
then I'm going to kill him. "

05:25.735 --> 05:29.000
Transcripts of your
conversations with strangers,

05:29.100 --> 05:34.800
in various drinking dens,
since you first came to our attention.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.965
You know,
no one likes a smart-ass.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.465
Tell us where he is
and we'll release you.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.765
- Why do you wanna know?
- You're in Torchwood, Cardiff.

05:42.800 --> 05:48.000
The Torchwood Institute was created to
combat the threat posed by The Doctor,

05:48.035 --> 05:51.100
and other phantasmagoria.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.865
He's not a threat.

05:53.900 --> 05:58.600
The Doctor's the one who'll save you
from your phantasmahoojits.

05:58.635 --> 06:02.200
- Just tell us his location.
- I don't know!

06:04.900 --> 06:06.600
He left me behind.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.300
I came here to find him.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.900
He refuels from that rift you have.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.100
Hoping if I stayed here long enough,
we'd find each other.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.065
- Now, can I go?
- No.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.400
- You can't keep me here!
- Oh, we can.

06:26.435 --> 06:28.765
- Unless...
- Yes.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.750
- Unless.
- Unless what?

06:30.785 --> 06:32.700
There are opportunities here.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.100
- With the Institute.
- I'm not for hire.

06:35.135 --> 06:38.000
You're going to need currency.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.200
- What's the assignment?
- Missing person.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.000
Well, when we say person...

06:48.600 --> 06:49.765
I haven't done anything!

06:49.800 --> 06:52.500
12 burglaries, joyriding
a horse and carriage,

06:52.600 --> 06:53.700
7 cases of pick-pocketing,

06:53.800 --> 06:56.300
24 instances of consuming
food without paying for it.

06:56.335 --> 06:58.800
It's like an addiction
with your species, isn't it?

06:58.900 --> 07:01.000
I'll make it up, I promise!

07:01.035 --> 07:02.200
Ah, too late.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.865
It's just a bit of fun.

07:03.900 --> 07:07.800
This planet's a century away from
official first contact with alien life.

07:07.835 --> 07:09.600
You're upsetting the schedule.

07:09.635 --> 07:11.900
Who are you?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.600
I'm Torchwood.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.365
I said sorry!
You can't lock me up!

07:18.400 --> 07:20.500
He's just a kid. Send him
back to where he came from.

07:20.535 --> 07:21.600
If only we could.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.365
- The rift only goes one way.
- What do you do?

07:23.400 --> 07:27.000
Observe and profile the species and
then transfer them to long term storage?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.100
- Why?!
- It was a threat to the Empire.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.300
- Like me?!
- You're our ally now.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.300
If you don't want it...

07:59.400 --> 08:01.500
Your next assignment.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.700
No.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.300
- I'm through with you people.
- Your liberty is at our discretion.

08:06.335 --> 08:08.500
Work for us,
you assist the Empire.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.500
Sever that tie,
you become a threat.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.500
And you've seen how
we deal with threats.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.365
It's good money, Captain.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.500
How else are you going to earn?

08:31.600 --> 08:34.600
See what you think in the morning.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.799
He's pretty.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.100
But you're prettier.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.300
Can I read your cards?

09:02.700 --> 09:05.000
No, thank you.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.000
No, really.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.665
He's coming.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.400
The one you're looking for.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.600
But the century will turn twice
before you find each other again.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.900
Are you for real?

09:40.700 --> 09:43.900
You mean I have to wait
100 years to find him?

09:46.800 --> 09:49.400
What'll I do in the meantime?

10:41.100 --> 10:44.965
<i>Some parts of the world have
already welcomed in the New Year.</i>

10:45.000 --> 10:49.300
<i>Our cameras, of course, have been
out in force across the UK tonight.</i>

10:49.335 --> 10:51.900
<i>Let's take you first to Cardiff.</i>

10:54.500 --> 10:57.465
Hey, when you joked about
the Millennium Bug,

10:57.500 --> 11:01.200
I didn't realise it was gonna
have 18 legs stacked with poison.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.065
Anyone home?

11:03.100 --> 11:06.000
You know you're supposed
to party like it's...

11:25.400 --> 11:27.950
- Alex?
- Jack!

11:27.985 --> 11:30.500
Just in time.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.700
Alex what happened?
Who did this?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.300
Me.

11:37.335 --> 11:39.200
What?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.865
Why?

11:42.900 --> 11:45.165
We got it wrong, Jack.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.700
We thought we could control
the stuff we found.

11:47.735 --> 11:52.265
And what's it brought us?
So much death.

11:52.300 --> 11:56.700
- What happened to them?
- It's good you're here.

11:56.735 --> 11:59.665
Always did have great timing.

11:59.700 --> 12:04.900
This place, it's yours.
Torchwood Three.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.500
My gift to you, Jack, for a century
of service as field operative.

12:09.535 --> 12:11.900
Give this place a purpose.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.950
Before it's too late. Please.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.900
Alex, listen, it's gonna be okay.

12:17.935 --> 12:20.600
No. It's not.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.900
It's really not.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.600
I looked inside.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.800
It showed me what's coming.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.900
They were mercy killings.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.700
It was the kindest thing
I could do.

12:38.735 --> 12:41.900
So none of us see the storm.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.800
I'm sorry I can't do
the same for you.

12:48.500 --> 12:52.800
21st century, Jack.
Everything's gonna change.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.400
- And we're not ready.
- Alex!

13:06.900 --> 13:08.165
He was dead!

13:08.200 --> 13:10.100
- I checked his pulse. He was dead!
- All right!

13:11.500 --> 13:13.800
Jack, what has happened?
Where are the others?

13:13.835 --> 13:14.565
What is he doing here?

13:14.600 --> 13:17.700
Look, I was late, okay.
He gave me a lift. You okay?

13:18.500 --> 13:21.600
Toshiko.
She went the other way.

13:57.300 --> 14:01.900
Never thought Id say this to
anyone here, but you work too hard.

14:01.935 --> 14:03.865
Another hour and I'm done.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.765
I wish the rest of them
thought like you.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.800
Half past five, they're out
of here like a pack of dogs.

14:08.835 --> 14:12.700
- You have a good evening, sir.
- I doubt it.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.800
Another late one, miss Sato?

16:38.835 --> 16:40.117
You know me, George.

16:40.152 --> 16:41.365
Married to the job.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.465
When you gonna let me whisk
you away from all this?

16:43.500 --> 16:46.100
As soon as you clear it with
your wife and grandchildren.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.800
Always an excuse.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.465
Take care.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.400
Goodnight, George.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.000
- I've got it.
- Get in.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.100
I want to see my mother.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.200
I want to know she's safe. Now.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.000
Show me the piece.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.865
Oh, it's beautiful.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.865
Perfect sonic modulator.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.600
Toshiko, you've done so well.

18:40.635 --> 18:42.100
Toshiko!

18:44.700 --> 18:46.200
You've got what you want.

18:46.235 --> 18:47.365
Now let her go.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.300
Except now you're the victim
of your own success.

18:50.335 --> 18:53.200
Perfectly situated, proven ability.

18:53.235 --> 18:55.400
You can give us so much more.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.565
And what if I refuse?

19:00.600 --> 19:03.365
Then your mother stays with us.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.300
And your brilliance is
used against her.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.900
- Like this.
- No, don't!

19:24.700 --> 19:26.000
Please!

19:34.100 --> 19:37.700
Turn it off! Turn it off!

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100
My mother!

19:44.600 --> 19:47.500
Is she all right? Is she all right?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.100
<i>This is a UNIT facility.</i>

20:02.300 --> 20:05.000
<i>Your rights as a citizen
have been withdrawn.</i>

20:05.100 --> 20:07.100
<i>You will be held here
indefinitely.</i>

20:07.300 --> 20:10.800
<i>We are not required to provide
you with legal representation.</i>

20:11.000 --> 20:13.400
<i>Anything you say will be recorded.</i>

20:13.600 --> 20:16.900
<i>You will be allowed no
communication with any person</i>

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
<i>or organisation
outside this facility.</i>

20:20.100 --> 20:22.300
<i>There is no right of appeal.</i>

20:22.600 --> 20:27.200
<i>If you fail to comply with the rules,
we are authorised to discipline you.</i>

20:27.400 --> 20:28.300
Is my mother safe?

20:28.400 --> 20:32.300
<i>We cannot supply you
with that information.</i>

21:19.600 --> 21:22.700
<i>Prisoner Sato. Inspection.</i>

21:23.300 --> 21:25.000
What for?

21:25.300 --> 21:28.000
<i>Prepare for inspection.</i>

21:54.900 --> 21:57.700
Catering is as lousy
as they say, huh?

22:05.100 --> 22:06.650
- Where's my mother?
- She's safe.

22:06.685 --> 22:08.200
She won't remember being kidnapped.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.300
I wiped it from her memory.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.100
- I hope you don't mind.
- You did what?

22:13.135 --> 22:16.067
Really, just a little pill.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.651
She'll never have known.

22:18.686 --> 22:21.200
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

22:21.700 --> 22:24.000
I don't exist.

22:25.500 --> 22:29.800
And for a man with my charisma,
that is quite an achievement.

22:29.835 --> 22:34.000
- Are you a lawyer?
- Do I look like a lawyer?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.465
They're gonna make an
example of you.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.850
Stealing official secrets,
in todays climate...

22:41.885 --> 22:45.200
They're going to keep
you here without charge.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.500
Forever.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.000
- They can't do that...
- They're never going to release you.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.600
I'm sorry.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.600
You made this, right?

23:08.200 --> 23:09.700
I just followed the plans.

23:09.735 --> 23:12.165
Yeah, kinda.

23:12.200 --> 23:16.900
But first you had to grasp the concept
of what a sonic modulator does.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.200
Most people would struggle with that.

23:19.235 --> 23:21.100
And another thing...

23:21.400 --> 23:23.300
the plans don't work.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.665
What?

23:24.700 --> 23:28.065
The technical plans you followed,
they were wrong.

23:28.100 --> 23:32.600
- They had mistakes in them.
- That's why the plans were shelved.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.300
But you, Toshiko Sato,

23:38.300 --> 23:40.600
you automatically fixed things
as you went along.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.500
What I'm trying to say is...

23:45.100 --> 23:48.100
oh baby, you're good.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.865
I mean, you're good now.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.900
Imagine what youd be like
with a little training.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.800
Shame you're gonna be
locked up for so long.

24:02.835 --> 24:06.200
- You've got to get me out of here.
- If...

24:06.800 --> 24:12.165
- you come work for me.
- Really?

24:12.200 --> 24:17.000
Give me five years, I got them
to wipe your record clean.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.500
They owe me a few favours.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.500
- What do you do?
- Protect people.

24:25.535 --> 24:28.617
Least, that's what I'm aiming for.

24:28.652 --> 24:31.665
It's kind of a work in progress.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.700
- What about my mother?
- Limited contact only.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.500
You can send her postcards.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.700
So what do you say?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.200
Why would you trust me?

24:46.800 --> 24:48.600
Instinct.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.600
It's going to be dangerous.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.500
Think you can bear a little danger?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.665
Stop! Stop! Stop!

24:59.700 --> 25:02.500
- Tosh! Tosh, are you okay?
- You're making it worse.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.900
It's pushing down even more now.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.000
I think I've broken my arm.

25:08.035 --> 25:08.865
- Gwen.
- Yeah?

25:08.900 --> 25:11.400
If this pillar shifts down
even more, it'll crush me.

25:11.435 --> 25:13.900
It's not good, Gwen.
Were gonna need more strength.

25:13.935 --> 25:16.400
Look, Jack has gone
to find Owen and lanto.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.200
You're gonna be fine, darling,
all right. You're gonna be fine.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.850
You've gotta hurry, please.

25:20.885 --> 25:22.400
Go help Jack. I'll stay here.

25:22.600 --> 25:22.965
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.900
I'm going to come back
for you darling, all right?

25:24.935 --> 25:26.900
- You're going to be okay.
- Okay.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.900
Gwen, this could've been you,
couldn't it?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
- If you hadn't been late.
- Look, Rhys,

25:32.100 --> 25:35.500
I haven't got time for this now, okay?
I've got to try and find the others.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.500
<i>lanto!</i>

25:57.900 --> 25:59.200
<i>lanto!</i>

26:48.000 --> 26:52.300
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.

26:52.900 --> 26:55.165
And you are?

26:55.200 --> 26:58.165
Jones, lanto Jones.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.100
Nice to meet you, Jones,
lanto Jones.

27:01.135 --> 27:03.465
Captain Jack Harkness.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.400
- Lucky escape.
- I had it under control.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.600
You think so?

27:08.800 --> 27:10.900
It looked pretty vicious.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.500
You're, um...

27:15.500 --> 27:17.765
<i>you were bleeding.</i>

27:17.800 --> 27:20.400
Had worse from shaving.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.365
Look like a Weevil to me.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.700
I've no idea
what you're talking about.

27:29.100 --> 27:31.800
I'll take him from here.

27:38.400 --> 27:41.000
Thanks for the assistance.

27:41.035 --> 27:43.000
Anytime.

27:44.800 --> 27:49.000
By the way, love the coat.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.600
Morning.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.400
Coffee?

28:14.100 --> 28:15.900
- I want to work for you.
- Sorry. No vacancies.

28:16.100 --> 28:17.100
Look, let me tell you
about myself.

28:17.300 --> 28:20.300
lanto Jones,
born August 19th 1983.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.700
Able student but not exceptional,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.400
one minor conviction
for shoplifting in your teens.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.000
Number of temporary jobs,
mainly a drifter,

28:28.100 --> 28:31.100
until two years ago you join
the Torchwood Institute in London.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.700
Junior researcher.
Girlfriend, Lisa Hallett.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.765
- Deceased.
- Sorry.

28:34.800 --> 28:39.800
- Look, you checked me out.
- You knew what a Weevil was.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.665
Thought I was gonna
have to come deal with you.

28:41.700 --> 28:44.100
But instead you could see, I have
the right qualifications for the job.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.165
There is no job.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.600
We're nothing to do
with Torchwood London.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.465
I severed all links.

28:49.500 --> 28:53.400
Yet when it burned, two members
of your team scavenged the ruins.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.900
Don't want the equipment
getting into the wrong hands.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
And you're the right hands, are you?

28:58.100 --> 28:59.400
Trial period, three months.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.700
- No.
- Three weeks. Three days.

29:02.800 --> 29:03.600
Let me prove myself to you.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.400
- I'll work for nothing.
- No.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.000
I saw what they did
at Canary Wharf.

29:09.900 --> 29:11.300
What am I supposed to do
with those memories?

29:11.400 --> 29:14.100
You are not my responsibility.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.900
And we're not hiring.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.600
Same time tomorrow then.

29:18.700 --> 29:22.200
There is no job for you here
and there never will be.

29:22.700 --> 29:25.200
I really like that coat.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.600
<i>Toshiko, see if you can
decode those hieroglyphics.</i>

29:30.635 --> 29:31.300
<i>Already on it.</i>

29:31.400 --> 29:33.900
<i>Owen, take a cross section
of the paramedics brain,</i>

29:34.000 --> 29:35.700
<i>check it against the list
of chemical agents.</i>

29:35.900 --> 29:36.400
<i>Will do.</i>

29:36.500 --> 29:38.400
<i>Susie, we're going to need to
dredge the reservoir.</i>

29:38.500 --> 29:41.000
<i>See if you can find
the other half.</i>

29:45.400 --> 29:47.500
- Okay, this has to stop.
- No, listen to me.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.365
I don't have time for this.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.600
I don't care what your problem is,
I want you out of this city by sunrise.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.000
There is no place for you here.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.300
Go back to London,
find yourself another life.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.000
Keep stalking me,
I'll wipe your memory.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.700
- No, but the thing is...
- Look, any conversation between us,

30:01.800 --> 30:05.665
no matter what the subject,
is over! Finished, done, forever!

30:05.700 --> 30:08.900
I'm getting back behind the wheel of
that car and if you're still in the road,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm going to drive through you.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.400
You're not gonna help me
catch this pterodactyl then?

30:17.300 --> 30:20.050
Okay, that is the only
special equipment you've got?

30:20.085 --> 30:22.800
Yeah, cos I keep dinosaur nets
in the back of the SUV.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Torchwood London would've.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.900
- How did you find it?
- Rift activity locator.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.065
- Torchwood London.
- See, quality kit.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.600
- Yeah, it's quite excitable.
- Must be your aftershave.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.800
- Never wear any.
- You smell like that naturally?

30:47.000 --> 30:51.600
51st century pheromones.
You people have no idea.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.800
- Ready for another go?
- I'm game if you are.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.900
Three, two, one...

30:58.800 --> 31:00.400
Split up!

31:09.300 --> 31:11.400
We're not gonna harm you.

31:11.435 --> 31:13.200
You can't stay here.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.465
Come back with me.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.600
I've got somewhere nice and big
where you can fly around.

31:18.635 --> 31:20.800
Okay, so you'll let the
pterodactyl in and not me.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.600
- We need a guard dog.
- I can be that.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.765
Like a receptionist.

31:25.800 --> 31:30.700
Building maintenance,
food and drink, dry cleaning even.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.000
That coat of yours
must take a battering.

31:33.035 --> 31:34.400
Like a butler,
I could be a butler.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.500
We don't need a butler.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.400
Excuse me,
dried egg on your collar.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.800
- It was a busy week.
- What exactly is your plan?

31:42.300 --> 31:45.700
- I'm going to be the decoy.
- And it will rip you to shreds.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.000
Dinosaurs?

31:47.100 --> 31:48.365
Had em for breakfast.

31:48.400 --> 31:52.900
Had to, only source of pre-killed
food protein after the asteroid crashed.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.200
Long story. Here you go.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.200
One injection to the
central nervous cortex.

31:59.235 --> 32:01.500
I'll keep it occupied. Move.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.900
- No.
- What?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.500
It knows me.
I'll be a better decoy.

32:05.535 --> 32:06.365
No, way too dangerous.

32:06.400 --> 32:10.900
No, I've got a secret weapon.
Chocolate. Preferably dark.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.900
I got your favourite, yeah.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.800
It's good for your serotonin levels.

32:35.835 --> 32:40.500
If you've got serotonin levels.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.700
lanto!

33:05.700 --> 33:07.000
Sorry!

33:19.500 --> 33:21.200
I should go.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.300
Hey!

33:29.600 --> 33:32.100
Report for work
first thing tomorrow.

33:37.900 --> 33:40.400
Like the suit, by the way.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.700
Ready? On three. 1, 2, 3...
Come on. Come on.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.300
- You okay?
- My shoulder.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.865
I think it's dislocated.

33:59.900 --> 34:01.700
- Can you take this?
- Yeah.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.300
Take a deep breath.

34:09.800 --> 34:10.364
Where are the others?

34:10.400 --> 34:12.100
We need your help
to get Toshiko out.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.764
- Owen?
- No sign yet.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.600
If anything happens
he can't repair himself.

34:15.635 --> 34:17.266
Of course, he can't heal,
can he?

34:17.302 --> 34:18.900
Okay, we'll help Rhys
with Toshiko.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.199
Let us know when
you find Owen.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.300
- And be careful.
- Okay.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.699
Okay? All right?

34:50.400 --> 34:53.000
Oh, go on,
please, please, please, please...

34:53.034 --> 34:54.199
No, you don't even like her,

34:54.300 --> 34:56.850
ever since she didn't pay for her
share of the Chinese in Leicester.

34:56.885 --> 34:59.400
Yeah, but we want Julia to come
and it'll look odd if we invite one

34:59.500 --> 35:02.700
- without the other.
- Oh, God. Help me, please.

35:02.735 --> 35:05.600
Three tables done.
Nine more to go.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.800
You wanna back out?

35:07.900 --> 35:10.600
It's still not too late.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.900
Listen, I'm marrying you
even if it kills me. Okay?

35:22.600 --> 35:24.700
Good.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.300
Do you want a cup of tea?

35:28.300 --> 35:32.600
- Yeah, I'll make one.
- I think I can manage.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.500
- Katie.
- Yeah?

35:46.600 --> 35:51.100
- Um, water.
- Yeah.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.900
From the kettle.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.065
Milk.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.500
Stop nagging me!
I don't want to have milk.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.900
I've never liked milk.
I want to have...

36:15.800 --> 36:17.065
Tea.

36:17.100 --> 36:20.000
I wanna have tea without...

36:22.300 --> 36:23.365
Milk.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.000
Tea without milk.

36:32.700 --> 36:35.900
- No.
- It's all right. It's all right.

36:38.800 --> 36:42.700
<i>I got your invitation.
Still going ahead?</i>

36:42.800 --> 36:46.665
- I promised her a summer wedding.
- Before all this.

36:46.700 --> 36:51.800
- This changes nothing.
- Owen, it will change everything.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.465
You don't know for certain.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.300
We've been through
Kates test results

36:55.400 --> 36:57.400
more times than any patient
in my whole career.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.665
You looked through them yourself.

36:59.700 --> 37:03.300
All the evidence suggests
she has early onset Alzheimers.

37:03.335 --> 37:05.200
The youngest case in medical history.

37:05.300 --> 37:06.965
It doesn't mean we're wrong.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.800
Please... run more tests.
Lets just try one more MRI scan.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.500
An MRI isn't going to
make any difference.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.365
You don't know that.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.600
You have said yourself that this is
unlike any case that you've seen,

37:18.635 --> 37:20.300
- maybe you've missed something.
- Owen...

37:20.500 --> 37:23.065
You don't understand, Jim, okay.

37:23.100 --> 37:26.100
One day she's fine,
she's perfect memory of the old Katie,

37:26.200 --> 37:28.700
and then the next
there's nothing, she's blank.

37:28.800 --> 37:33.200
Now, I am losing her and I don't
know what to do about that, okay?

37:33.235 --> 37:35.600
So please...

37:36.200 --> 37:40.300
what's the point of me doing this job
if I can't help my own fiancee?

37:40.600 --> 37:43.000
I'll see what I can do.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.100
Thank you, Jim.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.600
It's like...

38:37.300 --> 38:38.700
being lost, in a place you
know really well,

38:38.900 --> 38:40.700
but you can't get your bearings.

38:41.300 --> 38:44.200
Sometimes it comes back to you.
And sometimes...

38:45.300 --> 38:47.500
I'm sorry, Owen.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.400
What've you got to be sorry for?

38:51.600 --> 38:55.100
I don't want to put you through this.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.600
Last night, I dreamt that you left me.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.865
Oh, come on.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.400
Nobody's leaving anyone.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.100
- How is that possible?
- We don't know.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.800
I've never seen anything like it.
It's not the brain deteriorating.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.200
- It's a clear physical tumour.
- That wasnt there last week?

39:20.300 --> 39:22.100
Not that we saw.

39:23.300 --> 39:26.200
You were right to ask
for another scan.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.300
So what do we do now?

39:28.400 --> 39:30.300
We have to view this
as good news.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.000
Katie, we need to take you
into surgery,

39:32.100 --> 39:34.800
soon as possible,
and remove the tumour.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.100
Do you understand?

39:40.500 --> 39:42.200
Katie?

39:42.700 --> 39:45.500
I can't remember your name.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.100
Are you sure she's up to this?

39:55.500 --> 39:57.900
We're going to do
everything we can for her.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.565
I'm sorry.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.765
Who the hell are you?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.600
I tried to tell them.
You should prepare for the worst.

40:26.635 --> 40:29.200
No, you can't go in there.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.800
Oh, my God!

40:38.000 --> 40:39.800
Katie.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.365
What is it?

40:45.400 --> 40:48.400
I'm sorry. I tried to stop them.

40:48.435 --> 40:50.400
She's dead.

40:52.600 --> 40:56.165
That thing in her head
is an alien life form.

40:56.200 --> 41:00.800
It incubates in the brain,
disrupting the shape and functions.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.600
When it's attacked or threatened,

41:02.900 --> 41:05.600
it emits a toxic gas
that's fatal to humans.

41:05.635 --> 41:07.365
It clears pretty quickly.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.800
She can't be dead. She can't be dead.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.365
I'm calling, calling the police.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.200
Tell them that Torchwood is
already here and dealing with it.

41:14.235 --> 41:16.365
That'll save them a call-out.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.800
I need to take her brain
back with me.

41:18.300 --> 41:20.600
Don't touch her!

41:38.600 --> 41:40.200
- How are you feeling?
- Where is she?

41:40.235 --> 41:41.565
- Where's who?
- Katie.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.200
Katie Russell,
she's a junior doctor,

41:43.300 --> 41:45.350
she works here,
we're about to get married.

41:45.385 --> 41:47.400
- Let's get you back into bed.
- Get off me.

41:47.435 --> 41:48.500
Where is she?

41:48.800 --> 41:49.900
Where is she?

41:50.200 --> 41:52.200
Where is she?!

41:52.800 --> 41:57.800
He was wearing a military uniform.
He had an American accent.

41:57.835 --> 42:00.800
I promise, we have checked all
the security footage.

42:00.835 --> 42:01.965
There was no such man.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.400
Jim Garrett was poisoned by
some alien toxin, by some...

42:05.435 --> 42:07.365
Jim Garrett was in a car accident.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.800
The American said that he wanted
her brain, that there was, er...

42:10.835 --> 42:13.600
alien creature, or...

42:14.400 --> 42:15.965
This happened, okay?

42:16.000 --> 42:20.600
This is not some trauma or delayed grief
or whatever you're scribbling down.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.165
Katies tumour was inoperable.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.400
There was nothing
anyone could have done.

42:26.435 --> 42:29.400
This is just wrong.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.800
I'm giving you three months
prescribed rest.

42:32.835 --> 42:35.200
Don't come into work.

42:35.400 --> 42:37.200
Yeah?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
This isn't right.

42:45.035 --> 42:47.000
He was there.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.800
It wasn't just me.

42:50.835 --> 42:52.400
He was there too.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.800
That is not what happened!

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
That is... not what happened.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.800
You!

43:45.000 --> 43:46.300
You could've saved her!

43:46.600 --> 43:48.900
You could've saved her!

43:50.000 --> 43:52.800
You could've... saved her!

43:57.400 --> 43:58.500
I couldn't.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.600
I really couldn't.

44:07.700 --> 44:10.700
If you're not a figment
of my imagination,

44:11.200 --> 44:13.200
then I don't know what's
happening any more.

44:13.235 --> 44:14.965
Maybe this is...

44:15.000 --> 44:17.800
what a mental breakdown
feels like.

44:17.835 --> 44:18.965
You're fine.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.400
It's the rest of the world
that's delusional.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.600
Why her?

44:26.400 --> 44:28.765
There's no reason.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.800
Your life doesn't end with her.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.365
What are you gonna do now?

44:34.400 --> 44:38.000
Go back to work? See echoes
of her in every corridor?

44:38.035 --> 44:39.717
You need a purpose.

44:39.752 --> 44:41.400
I'm building something.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.800
I need a medic.

44:43.835 --> 44:46.000
And you want me?

44:46.400 --> 44:48.200
You made them take more scans.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.600
You kept trying to track me down.

44:50.635 --> 44:52.200
You don't give up easily.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.200
I need someone like that
to work with me in Cardiff.

44:55.235 --> 44:57.200
To fight aliens.

44:57.235 --> 44:59.000
Exactly.

45:00.200 --> 45:02.165
Look...

45:02.200 --> 45:07.000
I dunno what happened to Katie
and I dunno who you really are,

45:07.400 --> 45:09.800
but there is no such thing
as aliens.

45:09.835 --> 45:11.600
You think?

45:13.800 --> 45:17.000
I'm having a... breakdown.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.800
Mental collapse.

45:22.200 --> 45:27.200
Owen, why did you become a doctor?

45:27.600 --> 45:33.000
I thought if I could save one life,
mine would be worthwhile.

45:33.800 --> 45:37.800
But you save one...
and there's another, and another.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.400
All clawing at you,
demanding to be saved.

45:42.200 --> 45:47.400
And even if you do succeed,
you can never save enough.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.800
Maybe here you can.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.600
- How are the others?
- All right.

46:00.635 --> 46:02.000
Careful!

46:02.800 --> 46:03.800
If that falls...

46:04.000 --> 46:06.400
Okay, it's not going to fall...

46:09.000 --> 46:10.365
- Okay.
- Just be very careful.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.800
Okay, all right, all right.
Were gonna get you out.

46:12.835 --> 46:15.400
Okay, this one?

46:16.200 --> 46:21.400
- Look, if you do it very, very gently...
- Okay. It isn't going to drop on you.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.965
- Quiet.
- Okay. Okay, sorry.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I'm going to do this
as quickly as possible.

46:27.035 --> 46:29.000
Listen to me. I'm going
to get you out of this.

46:29.035 --> 46:30.765
Look at me, trust me.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.600
- Okay, hold my hands.
- Sorry.

46:32.635 --> 46:34.600
Hold my hands!

46:38.800 --> 46:40.800
<i>You okay?</i>

46:41.600 --> 46:42.965
You all right?

46:43.000 --> 46:45.600
- Tosh, what happened?
- Broken arm, bruised ribs,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.800
about an inch away from
being crushed by a girder.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.800
- You were lucky.
- We all were.

46:50.835 --> 46:52.917
Jack, who's done this?

46:52.952 --> 46:55.000
And where's the SUV?

46:56.800 --> 46:57.765
Oh, no.

46:57.800 --> 46:59.200
Jack, what does he want?

46:59.235 --> 47:01.565
<i>Oh, deja vu!</i>

47:01.600 --> 47:03.000
<i>Or did I say that already?</i>

47:03.035 --> 47:04.200
<i>Hey, team.</i>

47:04.400 --> 47:07.800
<i>Of course, there might be
a few less of you by now.</i>

47:07.835 --> 47:10.200
<i>Don't know if you liked
my little gift.</i>

47:10.235 --> 47:12.400
<i>Of course, you can't die.</i>

47:13.600 --> 47:18.600
<i>And with all that life, all that time,
you can't spare any for me.</i>

47:21.200 --> 47:23.200
<i>Say hi to the family.</i>

47:24.800 --> 47:26.365
No... it can't be.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.600
<i>Been a while since you've
seen your brother, eh, Jack?</i>

47:30.200 --> 47:31.965
Gray?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.765
<i>Okay, here's what's
going to happen.</i>

47:34.800 --> 47:38.800
<i>Everything you love,
everything you treasure will die.</i>

47:38.835 --> 47:41.965
<i>I'm going to tear your world apart,</i>

47:42.000 --> 47:46.200
<i>Captain Jack Harkness,
piece by piece.</i>

47:46.235 --> 47:48.165
<i>Starting now.</i>

47:48.200 --> 47:51.600
<i>Maybe now you'll wanna
spend some time with me.</i>

47:59.400 --> 48:01.165
This was a targeted attack.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.965
The beast killed the four most
senior officers.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.800
If it gets out what happened here,
there'll be city-wide panic.

48:06.835 --> 48:08.800
Let's go get ourselves
a good view.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
What have you done?!

48:11.100 --> 48:12.800
We're going to put the city
back together,

48:12.900 --> 48:14.600
we're going to find Jack...

48:15.000 --> 48:16.800
and we're going to punish John.

48:16.835 --> 48:18.600
It's completely crippled us, Gwen.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.165
You're no fun.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.000
Owen, get out of there.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.400
What have you done
with my brother?

48:23.435 --> 48:26.400
This is going to get nasty.

48:27.300 --> 48:28.600
What if this is how it all ends?
