WEBVTT

01:53.213 --> 01:55.148
United States.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.651
You're listening...

01:59.353 --> 02:01.355
It was your first
game, you know.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.123
You're not gonna win every game.

02:04.626 --> 02:05.827
I just wanna go home.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.463
We're gettin' there.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.061
Dad!

02:40.094 --> 02:41.228
She's bleeding!

02:43.898 --> 02:44.898
Dad!

02:47.367 --> 02:49.336
We'll stop in the next
town. I'll call the police.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.853
Dad, that girl.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.459
Tommy, listen to me carefully.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.428
I'm gonna go outside,
I'm gonna lock this door,

03:49.630 --> 03:51.632
and you don't open this door.

03:51.666 --> 03:54.367
You don't open it for
anyone, no one but me.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.003
Do you understand?

03:57.105 --> 03:58.105
Mhm.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.448
I'll be right back.

04:15.123 --> 04:16.123
Hello?

04:22.964 --> 04:23.964
Hello?

04:52.627 --> 04:54.262
Open the door, please!

04:54.294 --> 04:55.362
She's coming!

04:58.533 --> 05:00.268
Lock it, lock it!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.936
Please, she's coming!

05:01.969 --> 05:02.703
Please!

05:02.737 --> 05:04.505
Go, go, go!

05:04.539 --> 05:05.438
She's gonna come!

05:05.472 --> 05:07.008
Please!

05:07.041 --> 05:08.709
I know it, I know it!

05:11.045 --> 05:12.045
No!

05:12.713 --> 05:13.848
No, get away!

05:41.709 --> 05:42.709
Hey, Gerry.

05:47.682 --> 05:48.716
It's okay.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.417
It's over now.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.924
Can you tell me your name?

06:07.602 --> 06:08.602
Christina.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.606
My name's Christina.

06:30.057 --> 06:34.128
"Listen closely
and pay attention"

06:36.831 --> 06:39.100
to the what and the where.

06:45.907 --> 06:47.675
Because when this is over,

06:49.176 --> 06:53.281
"you will wonder, how did
we get from here to there?"

07:02.123 --> 07:03.190
Bye!

07:04.525 --> 07:05.793
Bye.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.894
Bye!

07:06.928 --> 07:07.828
Bye, miss bowden.

07:07.862 --> 07:08.862
Bye.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.908
You did great today, Michael.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.700
Thank you, miss bowden.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.122
Give me it!

08:44.025 --> 08:45.059
You're so annoying.

08:49.030 --> 08:50.030
Christina bowden?

08:51.098 --> 08:52.199
Give me it!

08:59.373 --> 09:00.373
Thank you.

09:02.977 --> 09:03.977
Ha ha!

09:06.981 --> 09:08.916
It's perfect, really.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.127
There's like a whole community,

09:10.151 --> 09:12.119
and Lisa can have her own room.

09:12.153 --> 09:14.688
There's a pool, and the
school system is great,

09:14.722 --> 09:16.525
I've already inquired
about transferring.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.558
Okay.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.061
What about your boyfriend?

09:20.094 --> 09:20.961
Tom, is it?

09:20.995 --> 09:22.096
Is he going to go with you?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.798
Yes, Tom.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.599
He's excited about it.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.902
There's a lot of
work down there,

09:27.935 --> 09:30.571
and I think it's gonna be a
fresh start for all of us.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.306
Well, this sounds really great.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.251
So, now we're just waiting
on the background check,

09:34.275 --> 09:35.576
which should come
at any day now.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.144
And if there are no surprises,

09:37.178 --> 09:39.914
the only thing left is
the home inspection.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.783
I have your address
here as 6 emerald drive.

09:42.817 --> 09:43.717
Where's that?

09:43.751 --> 09:44.952
Up on northridge.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.154
Oh, so you're up in the snow?

09:47.188 --> 09:48.155
Yeah.

09:48.189 --> 09:49.189
I'll bring my boots.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.962
So, one last question,
and this is just for me.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.063
Of course.

09:56.097 --> 09:57.798
This girl's no Saint.

09:57.832 --> 09:59.500
She's had trouble
with the police,

09:59.534 --> 10:02.036
she's been in and out of
foster homes her entire life.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.173
Why this girl?

10:10.177 --> 10:13.314
I had a tough time
growing up, just like her.

10:14.516 --> 10:18.553
And most of the things
that she's going through

10:19.987 --> 10:20.987
are not her fault,

10:22.189 --> 10:23.324
but she doesn't know that.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.528
She thinks everything
is her fault.

10:28.129 --> 10:30.064
She thinks she doesn't
deserve to be happy.

10:31.232 --> 10:34.536
So she does bad
things, stupid things,

10:34.569 --> 10:37.338
so that people see her the
way that she sees herself.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.474
But I don't see her like that.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.043
I see a scared kid who
deserves a second chance.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.548
I think we all deserve
a second chance.

11:49.410 --> 11:50.344
Hello?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.379
Hello, is anyone there, hello?

11:52.413 --> 11:53.414
Can anyone hear me?

11:54.982 --> 11:55.749
Can anyone hear me?

11:55.783 --> 11:56.685
We need help, now!

11:56.717 --> 11:57.952
Oh, shit!

11:59.720 --> 12:01.231
Ma'am, it's okay, I'm
trying to get you help.

12:01.255 --> 12:03.290
It's okay, I'm gonna
get you help, it's okay.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.459
What?

12:05.492 --> 12:06.260
G-G...

12:06.293 --> 12:07.293
Gun!

13:01.516 --> 13:02.516
Hello?

13:36.685 --> 13:38.553
Sheriff's department.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.860
Mr. Cooper.

13:46.894 --> 13:50.765
It's the sheriff's
department, it's time to go.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.111
Mr. Cooper?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.083
Sheriff's department.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.085
You need to vacate, sir.

14:20.762 --> 14:21.796
Mr. Cooper?

14:23.864 --> 14:24.864
Sir?

14:31.872 --> 14:32.872
This is Jamie.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.577
Jamie, it's Gerry Bailey.

14:38.646 --> 14:40.114
What can I do for you, Gerry?

14:45.386 --> 14:47.822
Do you know who
Elizabeth caulfield is?

14:48.922 --> 14:49.922
No.

14:50.825 --> 14:51.825
Should I?

14:56.564 --> 14:59.933
About 20 years ago, caulfield
kidnapped 5 young girls.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.103
3 from massena, 2 from wheaton.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.406
In two of the cases,

15:05.439 --> 15:08.275
the children were
taken from their homes,

15:08.308 --> 15:10.077
parents murdered in their beds.

15:12.747 --> 15:13.782
It went on for years.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.652
Just dumb luck we caught her.

15:23.691 --> 15:25.693
Where's this going, Gerry?

15:29.263 --> 15:31.999
There was an accident
this morning, up in utica.

15:33.167 --> 15:35.369
A U.S. marshal was
transporting a prisoner.

15:36.604 --> 15:38.873
Marshal's dead, the
prisoner's on the run.

15:40.775 --> 15:41.775
Caulfield?

15:44.846 --> 15:47.816
We found four girls in a
grave behind caulfield's house.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.186
The fifth one, the one that
survived, is still here,

15:52.219 --> 15:53.320
living in massena.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.493
I think caulfield may
come looking for her,

16:00.528 --> 16:01.796
finish what she started.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.200
I'd like you to make
sure that doesn't happen.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.340
Jamie.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.845
I'm gonna call you back, Gerry.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.716
Get out of my house.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.652
Mr. Cooper, put the gun down.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.088
This is my house,
my kids grew up here.

16:29.524 --> 16:30.792
I got married here.

16:30.825 --> 16:33.193
I understand, and
we can talk about it,

16:33.227 --> 16:35.195
but you need to put
the gun down first.

16:36.564 --> 16:37.899
Then what?

16:37.932 --> 16:40.568
Then we'll walk out of
here like nothing happened.

16:40.602 --> 16:42.035
But it did happen.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.069
It all happened.

16:44.104 --> 16:44.906
Now I'm nothing!

16:44.939 --> 16:46.273
No, that's not true.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.343
It's Kevin, right?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.044
Can I call you Kevin?

16:51.078 --> 16:53.515
You have your life,
this is just a house.

16:53.548 --> 16:55.048
It doesn't make you who you are.

16:57.585 --> 16:58.753
I'm nothing now, nothing!

16:58.786 --> 17:00.922
No, no, no, Kevin don't do this,

17:00.955 --> 17:02.435
we can talk about
it, don't do this...

17:54.742 --> 17:55.944
Hello?

17:55.977 --> 17:57.144
So, who is she?

18:20.034 --> 18:21.603
Happy birthday, lady.

18:21.636 --> 18:22.670
Thanks, sweetie.

18:23.638 --> 18:24.906
Hey, where's Tom?

18:24.939 --> 18:26.040
Oh, he had to work late.

18:27.775 --> 18:28.775
Miss bowden.

18:29.611 --> 18:30.979
What's her name?

18:31.012 --> 18:32.245
That's Rebecca.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.356
Tracy, put her back on a shelf

18:33.380 --> 18:34.949
before you break her, huh?

18:34.983 --> 18:35.984
Oh, she's fine.

18:36.017 --> 18:37.193
You want a piece of cake at all?

18:37.217 --> 18:38.285
I'll bring it to you.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.956
He's missing your birthday?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.256
Oh, it's fine.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.425
He's busy, and we're
gonna do something

18:45.459 --> 18:46.459
later in the week.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.999
Oh, hey, when's
this big announcement?

18:51.032 --> 18:54.301
I guess Tom is gonna
miss that too, huh?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.470
He knows already, so stop.

18:56.504 --> 18:57.972
And I'll make the
big announcement

18:58.006 --> 18:59.841
as soon as I find Lisa.

19:13.554 --> 19:14.555
Occupied.

19:15.757 --> 19:18.026
Still occupied.

19:18.926 --> 19:19.994
Lisa, it's me.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.265
You okay?

19:29.871 --> 19:31.806
You missed the
whole happy birthday

19:31.839 --> 19:34.709
and blowing out the
candles, et cetera.

19:34.742 --> 19:37.210
I'm sorry, but here.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.546
Happy birthday.

19:38.579 --> 19:40.682
I told you not
to get me anything.

19:40.715 --> 19:42.358
You have to wait 'til
you're alone to open it.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.382
It's nothing, really.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.022
Thank you.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.057
You ready?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.660
I guess.

19:52.694 --> 19:53.828
What about you?

19:53.861 --> 19:54.861
Are you ready?

19:56.463 --> 19:57.463
Me?

19:58.231 --> 19:59.901
I'm scared.

19:59.934 --> 20:01.736
I've never been
anybody's mom before.

20:02.804 --> 20:03.571
And I just keep thinking,

20:03.604 --> 20:05.238
"what if I mess this up?

20:05.272 --> 20:06.416
What if I do something wrong?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.042
What if she hates me?"

20:09.711 --> 20:11.579
Everyone messes
up sometimes, right?

20:12.580 --> 20:13.447
Right.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.982
So, why worry about it?

20:16.818 --> 20:20.253
And even if you do,
I won't hate you.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.556
That wouldn't be fair.

20:23.157 --> 20:24.434
This is your first
time doing this,

20:24.458 --> 20:25.738
so it's not gonna
be easy, right?

20:27.995 --> 20:29.463
It's not gonna be easy,

20:30.297 --> 20:31.799
but it's gonna be worth it.

20:32.633 --> 20:33.633
I promise.

20:36.070 --> 20:37.070
I'm ready.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.372
Me too.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.440
Come on.

20:42.577 --> 20:44.512
Can I have your
attention for a second?

20:46.246 --> 20:48.216
Thank you for coming.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.118
Today is not just
about my birthday.

20:51.185 --> 20:53.286
I have something very special

20:53.320 --> 20:55.489
that I want to
share with you all.

20:55.523 --> 20:58.425
I have been keeping this
a secret for a while now,

20:58.458 --> 21:00.595
but I am super
excited to say that...

21:03.030 --> 21:04.599
We have another guest.

21:04.632 --> 21:05.632
I'll be right back.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.405
Hi.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.274
I'm looking for
Christina bowden.

21:15.543 --> 21:16.543
That's me.

21:20.047 --> 21:21.616
How can I help you?

21:21.649 --> 21:24.351
I'm sorry to bother you
this late, miss bowden.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.255
I'm Jamie nwosu with the
sheriff's department.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.156
Do you mind if I come in

21:28.189 --> 21:29.349
and we can talk for a moment?

21:30.558 --> 21:32.527
I'm sorry, I have company.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.529
Can you just tell me
what this is about?

21:35.730 --> 21:37.598
Did I do something wrong?

21:37.632 --> 21:39.033
No, ma'am, it's not that.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.469
About 8 hours ago,
there was an accident

21:42.503 --> 21:44.939
up by ulster county,
a car accident.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.207
It was a prisoner transport.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.718
The prisoner was to
get medical treatment

21:47.742 --> 21:50.611
up in ulster coming up
from Camden township.

21:50.645 --> 21:51.789
The car must've
hit a slick patch

21:51.813 --> 21:53.446
and went off the road.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.982
Unfortunately, the U.S. marshal

21:55.016 --> 21:57.118
who was driving
the car was killed.

21:57.151 --> 21:59.020
That's awful, I'm sorry.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.320
Yes, it is.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.958
The reason I came to see you is

22:03.991 --> 22:05.893
that the prisoner
who was in back

22:05.927 --> 22:07.895
is currently unaccounted for.

22:07.929 --> 22:09.630
That being said,

22:09.664 --> 22:10.707
there are a lot of people
out there looking for her,

22:10.731 --> 22:13.466
and we hope this is
wrapped up quickly.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.669
But for the time being,

22:14.702 --> 22:16.904
it might be good for you
to stay with a friend,

22:16.938 --> 22:19.240
or get a hotel
room or something.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.977
Why would I need to do that?

22:23.010 --> 22:24.612
I just want to be careful.

22:25.746 --> 22:27.248
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.120
Miss bowden, the prisoner's
Elizabeth caulfield.

22:37.625 --> 22:39.392
What are you talking about?

22:39.426 --> 22:42.730
I understand this
has to be a bit of a shock.

22:42.763 --> 22:44.699
But I don't want you to panic.

22:44.732 --> 22:48.035
Police are out there
looking for her.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.038
Christina!

22:53.040 --> 22:54.040
Christina!

22:58.212 --> 23:00.615
Christina, where are you?

23:00.648 --> 23:01.648
Christina?

23:03.150 --> 23:04.150
Christina!

23:12.593 --> 23:14.962
Shh, she'll hear you.

23:17.298 --> 23:19.033
She's coming.

23:34.115 --> 23:35.750
What's this one's name?

23:38.986 --> 23:40.321
Hey, everything okay?

23:40.354 --> 23:41.255
Who was at the door?

23:41.289 --> 23:42.056
We have to go.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.057
What?

23:43.090 --> 23:44.158
- Why?
- Hey, are you okay?

23:44.191 --> 23:45.593
You're white as a sheet.

23:45.626 --> 23:46.961
I'm fine.

23:46.994 --> 23:49.297
Something just came up, and
I need to take Lisa home.

23:49.330 --> 23:50.731
Can you wrap this up here?

23:50.765 --> 23:51.632
Just apologize to
everyone for me.

23:51.666 --> 23:53.768
Christina, Christina, wait!

23:58.471 --> 23:59.240
What's going on?

23:59.273 --> 24:00.308
Why are the cops here?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.025
There was some
break-ins in the neighborhood,

24:08.049 --> 24:10.718
and it's just not safe for
you to be there right now.

24:12.787 --> 24:14.355
Why are you lying to me?

24:14.388 --> 24:15.799
Why can't you just tell
me what's going on?

24:15.823 --> 24:17.258
It's complicated, Lisa.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.693
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

24:18.726 --> 24:21.796
Just tell me, I'm not
gonna be mad, I promise.

24:21.829 --> 24:24.332
I just can't have
you near me right now.

24:24.365 --> 24:26.000
Can't have me near you?

24:26.033 --> 24:26.934
Why?

24:26.968 --> 24:28.048
Just stop asking questions!

24:51.726 --> 24:53.294
You don't have to
do this, you know.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.327
I understand.

24:56.397 --> 24:57.531
I'm used to it by now.

24:59.033 --> 25:01.002
This is going to
happen, I promise.

25:01.035 --> 25:02.570
Nothing has changed.

25:02.603 --> 25:04.071
Something's changed.

25:04.105 --> 25:05.382
You were just talking
about being family,

25:05.406 --> 25:06.984
and now you're throwing
me out of your house.

25:07.008 --> 25:08.476
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.745
I need time, I just need time.

25:20.721 --> 25:21.789
I gotta go.

25:24.692 --> 25:26.060
Lisa, wait!

26:25.119 --> 26:26.153
Miss bowden.

26:27.154 --> 26:28.154
You all right, ma'am?

26:29.423 --> 26:30.423
I'm okay.

26:31.292 --> 26:33.127
So, what now?

26:33.160 --> 26:34.438
I'm gonna stay out here tonight,

26:34.462 --> 26:35.729
keep an eye on things,

26:35.763 --> 26:37.566
and hopefully by the
time you wake up,

26:37.598 --> 26:38.598
this is all over.

26:40.434 --> 26:41.602
Thank you, officer.

26:41.635 --> 26:43.337
Please, call me Jamie.

26:45.139 --> 26:46.006
Thank you, Jamie.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.040
Goodnight.

26:49.210 --> 26:50.210
Miss bowden.

26:51.212 --> 26:53.180
I don't want you
to worry too much.

26:54.516 --> 26:55.950
There are a ton
of law enforcement

26:55.983 --> 26:57.618
out there looking for her.

26:57.651 --> 27:00.187
It's cold out, there are
road blocks everywhere,

27:00.221 --> 27:02.256
she's gonna have a hard
enough time surviving,

27:02.289 --> 27:04.191
much less have time
to think about you.

27:07.161 --> 27:09.096
You don't understand, Jamie.

27:09.130 --> 27:10.331
I'm all she thinks about.

27:32.554 --> 27:33.554
Oh!

27:41.228 --> 27:42.228
Hello?

27:44.198 --> 27:45.567
Hey, there's somebody in here.

28:10.391 --> 28:11.391
Hello?

29:15.657 --> 29:16.658
She was a nurse.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.930
Took care of the babies while
their moms got some sleep.

29:27.501 --> 29:30.337
She seemed like a normal person.

29:34.942 --> 29:36.587
But obviously there
was something different

29:36.611 --> 29:38.613
going on in that woman's head.

29:44.619 --> 29:46.755
One day she just
stopped coming to work,

29:46.787 --> 29:48.022
dropped outta sight.

29:49.189 --> 29:51.458
Five years later,
Christina disappeared.

29:53.662 --> 29:56.397
After that, every year,
another girl would go missing,

29:58.700 --> 30:01.201
and every year the girl she took

30:01.235 --> 30:03.470
would be a year older
than the girl before.

30:05.674 --> 30:06.708
Strange, isn't it?

30:07.575 --> 30:09.877
Christina being the first.

30:09.910 --> 30:11.078
Yeah, just random.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.785
I mean, she's the
first to be taken,

30:16.817 --> 30:18.586
she lives with
caulfield the longest,

30:19.820 --> 30:21.690
and yet she's the
one that gets away.

33:19.834 --> 33:22.837
Good morning, miss bowden.

33:22.871 --> 33:24.037
Is it a good morning?

33:24.939 --> 33:25.840
No.

33:25.874 --> 33:28.910
They're still looking for her.

33:28.943 --> 33:30.210
I see.

33:30.244 --> 33:31.144
Is there somewhere
I can take you?

33:31.178 --> 33:33.180
A friend that you can stay with?

33:33.213 --> 33:34.816
No.

33:34.849 --> 33:36.718
I mean, I've decided
I'm staying here.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.522
Miss bowden, we're
a small department.

33:41.723 --> 33:42.690
I don't have the
kind of resources

33:42.724 --> 33:45.392
to keep an eye on you 24/7.

33:46.528 --> 33:48.195
Please stop calling
me miss bowden.

33:48.228 --> 33:49.931
That's what my students call me.

33:49.964 --> 33:51.031
It's Christina.

33:52.232 --> 33:55.035
And it's not just
about staying home.

33:55.068 --> 33:57.939
I have a life here, a job.

33:57.972 --> 33:59.206
I can't just run away.

34:00.742 --> 34:01.943
I'm not asking you to run,

34:01.976 --> 34:04.913
just hide for a little while,

34:04.946 --> 34:06.046
until this is over.

34:07.882 --> 34:10.284
Look, Jamie, I appreciate
what you're doing.

34:10.317 --> 34:11.317
I really do.

34:12.419 --> 34:14.087
And I don't expect
you to understand.

34:15.222 --> 34:17.157
But she took everything
away from me once.

34:18.325 --> 34:20.294
Everything I ever
loved, she destroyed.

34:22.429 --> 34:24.164
I'm not gonna let
her do that again.

34:36.511 --> 34:37.511
Hi.

34:39.146 --> 34:40.146
Hey.

34:43.150 --> 34:46.086
Shoot the ball, shoot the ball.

34:47.655 --> 34:48.890
Over here!

34:48.923 --> 34:50.123
Pass it to me!

35:02.704 --> 35:05.305
I know that he loves me
whether I'm right.

35:05.339 --> 35:09.276
Or whether I'm wrong, for
the Bible tells me so.

35:10.645 --> 35:11.879
Is that enough?

35:32.332 --> 35:33.400
You have a visitor.

35:43.044 --> 35:44.879
Hey, Gerry.

35:44.912 --> 35:45.912
Jamie.

35:47.314 --> 35:49.017
I wasn't expecting you.

35:55.322 --> 35:57.992
Is there a problem, Gerry?

35:58.026 --> 35:59.159
No.

35:59.192 --> 36:00.227
Come on in.

36:13.074 --> 36:14.074
Amy?

36:15.375 --> 36:16.375
Jamie!

36:17.277 --> 36:19.346
What are you doing here?

36:19.379 --> 36:21.314
I thought you
were at the doctors.

36:21.348 --> 36:22.349
I was.

36:24.118 --> 36:25.352
I didn't know you were...

36:26.921 --> 36:28.388
Back in town.

36:28.422 --> 36:29.657
I am.

36:29.691 --> 36:31.211
I moved back in a
couple of months ago.

36:32.426 --> 36:34.762
Doctors want me to be
near family, just in case.

36:36.597 --> 36:37.597
Congratulations.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
Thank you.

36:41.536 --> 36:43.738
How far along are you?

36:45.540 --> 36:47.575
Um, all the way?

36:48.643 --> 36:50.210
Amy?

36:50.243 --> 36:52.345
Shouldn't you be lying down?

36:52.379 --> 36:53.480
Hello, Mrs. Bailey.

36:55.449 --> 36:56.450
She's right.

36:56.483 --> 36:57.885
I'm supposed to
stay off my feet.

36:59.153 --> 37:01.288
It was nice seeing you, Jamie.

37:01.321 --> 37:02.489
Nice to see you too.

37:11.632 --> 37:13.134
Close the door behind you.

37:24.612 --> 37:25.880
Can't make it down the hall

37:25.913 --> 37:27.393
without needing to
suck on this thing.

37:31.085 --> 37:32.419
That's Arlene's father.

37:33.988 --> 37:36.490
He was deep in
politics around here.

37:38.425 --> 37:40.728
You should've seen the
cold shoulder she got

37:40.762 --> 37:42.997
for bringing home some
dumb security guard.

37:44.297 --> 37:45.465
You could've told me.

37:46.768 --> 37:49.971
Not something we're
broadcasting all over town.

37:50.004 --> 37:54.441
She ain't married, father wants
nothing to do with the baby,

37:54.474 --> 37:55.710
Arlene's sick about it.

37:57.344 --> 37:59.814
We're just trying to keep
it quiet for right now.

38:05.553 --> 38:09.289
But we're not here to
talk about Amy, are we?

38:10.525 --> 38:11.525
No.

38:12.994 --> 38:13.994
No, we're not.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.500
So, how is she?

38:21.569 --> 38:22.837
A little shook up.

38:22.870 --> 38:25.006
But if she's scared, she
hides it pretty well.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.840
She's tough.

38:27.842 --> 38:29.944
Had to be to survive
that crazy bitch.

38:29.977 --> 38:30.978
Seems that way.

38:32.713 --> 38:34.481
She decided to
stay in the house.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.652
She's staying?

38:37.685 --> 38:38.685
Yeah.

38:39.419 --> 38:40.688
Why would she do that?

38:42.322 --> 38:43.191
I don't know her.

38:43.224 --> 38:46.194
I mean, she's a grown woman now,

38:46.227 --> 38:48.461
and caulfield is what,
60 something years old?

38:48.495 --> 38:51.065
You're gonna keep an
eye on her for me, Jamie.

38:51.098 --> 38:53.534
I don't want anything
happening to her.

38:53.568 --> 38:56.504
Gerry, you know better
than anyone our resources.

38:56.537 --> 38:58.840
I can't have
someone on her 24/7.

38:58.873 --> 39:00.908
That's a job for FBI or state.

39:00.942 --> 39:02.310
No.

39:02.342 --> 39:04.912
They get involved, it'll
be all over the news.

39:04.946 --> 39:06.346
Why is that a bad thing?

39:08.049 --> 39:10.685
I don't think you
understand what happened here.

39:12.452 --> 39:17.024
That little girl and the others
were taken under my nose,

39:17.058 --> 39:18.726
murdered on my watch.

39:20.393 --> 39:23.030
For a long time, I couldn't
show my face in this town.

39:24.699 --> 39:27.268
The minute anyone
knows who she is,

39:27.301 --> 39:29.737
it'll be like those
murders happened yesterday.

39:31.471 --> 39:32.616
You think I want
to put this town,

39:32.640 --> 39:34.642
my daughter, my wife
through that again?

39:36.944 --> 39:37.944
And Christina.

39:39.580 --> 39:40.580
Right?

39:41.649 --> 39:42.649
Right.

39:44.118 --> 39:45.253
And Christina.

40:07.842 --> 40:08.843
Shh.

40:21.923 --> 40:23.257
She's coming!

40:24.525 --> 40:25.525
Shh.

41:24.819 --> 41:25.820
Hello?

41:25.853 --> 41:26.787
Casey.

41:26.821 --> 41:28.990
Hey, it's Jamie nwosu.

41:29.023 --> 41:30.658
Hey, Jamie.

41:30.691 --> 41:32.460
Let me guess...

41:32.492 --> 41:34.362
No, I didn't break
my phone again.

41:35.763 --> 41:37.098
This is something different.

41:47.908 --> 41:50.544
Don't you have a
crime lab or something for this?

41:50.578 --> 41:52.346
No, I have to send it off,

41:52.380 --> 41:54.548
and I'm kind of in a rush, so.

41:58.085 --> 42:00.054
You smell like cigarettes.

42:00.087 --> 42:01.889
I was with someone
who smokes a lot.

42:03.090 --> 42:04.692
Smoke don't care who lights it,

42:04.725 --> 42:06.060
makes you smell just the same.

42:11.699 --> 42:15.603
Tell him how old you are today.

42:15.636 --> 42:16.937
I'm 10 years old today.

42:23.044 --> 42:24.044
What is this?

42:24.745 --> 42:27.114
Jesus loves me, this I know,

42:30.051 --> 42:32.386
because the Bible tells me so.

42:34.789 --> 42:35.789
What's happening?

42:36.991 --> 42:38.292
The tape is old.

42:38.325 --> 42:41.062
It's a miracle it
still plays at all.

42:41.095 --> 42:42.563
What's that right there?

42:42.596 --> 42:43.597
Over that picture?

42:43.631 --> 42:44.965
It's a timestamp.

42:44.999 --> 42:47.001
Some old video cameras
used to burn that in.

42:48.469 --> 42:50.938
Can you clean it up
somehow so I can read that?

42:52.073 --> 42:53.073
I can try.

42:55.009 --> 42:56.009
Where did you get this?

42:57.578 --> 43:00.815
Elizabeth caulfield's
home, 25 years ago.

43:01.749 --> 43:03.050
The woman on the news?

43:03.084 --> 43:04.084
Yeah.

43:05.019 --> 43:07.354
So this is one of the
girls that she killed.

43:09.657 --> 43:11.092
No.

43:11.125 --> 43:12.760
This is the one that got away.

43:14.028 --> 43:14.995
The search continues

43:15.029 --> 43:16.664
over a wide area
of the northeast

43:16.697 --> 43:19.600
as local law enforcement
from surrounding counties

43:19.633 --> 43:20.901
join in the effort.

43:20.935 --> 43:22.504
The search area
has been expanded

43:22.537 --> 43:24.905
to cover up to 200 square miles

43:24.939 --> 43:26.407
from the original crash site.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.275
But so far, there's
been no sighting

43:28.309 --> 43:29.578
of any kind...

43:29.610 --> 43:31.011
Of Ms. Caulfield.

43:31.045 --> 43:33.814
She's considered to be
armed and dangerous.

43:33.848 --> 43:35.517
Originally a nurse
in the maternity ward

43:35.550 --> 43:36.951
in massena county hospital,

43:36.984 --> 43:40.287
Ms. Caulfield went on
to kidnap 5 young girls.

43:43.457 --> 43:45.126
Hey!

43:45.159 --> 43:46.159
Hi, miss bowden.

43:47.294 --> 43:48.496
What are you doing here?

43:48.530 --> 43:50.030
What do you mean?

43:50.064 --> 43:52.209
You said you could watch
Tracy while I went to my class.

43:52.233 --> 43:53.233
Did you forget?

43:54.468 --> 43:55.468
No.

43:56.571 --> 43:57.671
Okay, maybe I did forget.

43:57.705 --> 43:58.939
Oh, Chris.

43:58.973 --> 44:00.485
I promise, I'll be
back in two hours tops.

44:00.509 --> 44:01.208
Okay?

44:01.242 --> 44:02.476
Sure.

44:02.511 --> 44:03.277
Have fun.

44:03.310 --> 44:04.345
Thank you.

44:09.150 --> 44:10.451
The house,

44:10.484 --> 44:11.661
and she has remained
out of the public eye

44:11.685 --> 44:13.687
despite caulfield's escape.

44:18.159 --> 44:19.793
So, what do you
want to do today?

44:19.827 --> 44:21.896
Do you want to draw?

44:21.929 --> 44:22.929
Or read a story?

44:24.198 --> 44:25.199
Let's play a game.

44:31.172 --> 44:32.206
One...

44:33.274 --> 44:34.274
Two...

44:35.242 --> 44:36.242
Three...

44:37.244 --> 44:38.379
Four...

44:39.446 --> 44:40.615
Five...

44:42.016 --> 44:43.016
Six...

44:43.851 --> 44:45.486
Seven...

44:45.520 --> 44:47.254
Eight...

44:47.288 --> 44:48.355
Nine...

44:48.389 --> 44:51.759
Ten!

44:51.792 --> 44:52.792
Tracy...

44:54.028 --> 44:55.362
Where are you?

45:01.302 --> 45:03.070
I'm gonna find you!

45:09.910 --> 45:10.778
Hello?

45:10.811 --> 45:12.046
Oh, hi, Christina.

45:12.079 --> 45:14.248
This is Elaine
foster, Tom's mom.

45:14.281 --> 45:15.550
Hi, how are you?

45:15.584 --> 45:18.419
I'm okay, I'm
just a little worried.

45:18.452 --> 45:21.188
And look, I know you and Tom
are not together anymore,

45:21.222 --> 45:23.357
but have you heard from him?

45:23.390 --> 45:25.893
No, we haven't
spoken in a while.

45:25.926 --> 45:27.194
Oh.

45:27.228 --> 45:28.305
He just didn't show
up for work today,

45:28.329 --> 45:30.565
and I've been trying
to call him all day

45:30.599 --> 45:32.266
and he's not picking up.

45:32.299 --> 45:34.134
I'm starting to get
a little worried.

45:35.402 --> 45:36.802
Listen, my husband
thinks I'm crazy.

45:37.606 --> 45:39.273
Tracy, you can come out now!

45:39.306 --> 45:40.709
This is kinda not like him.

45:40.741 --> 45:43.277
He always calls me, and I
feel like something is wrong.

45:43.310 --> 45:45.647
Tracy, the game is over.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.881
I'm sorry, I
didn't know who else to call,

45:47.915 --> 45:49.316
and I'm just worried about him.

45:50.918 --> 45:53.287
I was wondering if you
could just stop by the house

45:53.320 --> 45:55.256
and see if everything is okay?

45:55.289 --> 45:56.156
Of course.

45:56.190 --> 45:57.626
I can stop before work tomorrow.

45:57.659 --> 45:58.926
Tracy!

45:58.959 --> 46:00.894
Oh, thanks so much, Christina.

46:00.928 --> 46:01.730
Yeah, no problem.

46:01.762 --> 46:02.496
Take care.

46:02.530 --> 46:03.530
Tracy?

46:05.199 --> 46:06.199
Tracy?

46:07.101 --> 46:08.435
The game is over!

46:09.537 --> 46:10.605
Tracy!

46:12.339 --> 46:13.339
Tracy!

46:16.110 --> 46:17.512
I can't find her!

46:18.312 --> 46:19.446
I think she cheated.

46:21.716 --> 46:23.317
What?

46:23.350 --> 46:24.528
I saw her on the
porch when I pulled up,

46:24.552 --> 46:26.287
said she was playing
hide and seek.

46:27.622 --> 46:29.023
I'm sorry.

46:29.056 --> 46:30.124
Get inside, please.

46:32.661 --> 46:34.328
I'm babysitting.

46:34.361 --> 46:36.130
Like that's what
I need right now.

46:36.163 --> 46:37.163
You okay?

46:38.132 --> 46:39.668
No.

46:39.701 --> 46:40.711
She scared the hell out of me.

46:40.735 --> 46:41.969
I can see that.

46:43.638 --> 46:46.373
Do you want to come in?

46:46.407 --> 46:47.975
I need a glass of wine or two.

47:15.603 --> 47:16.671
Can I offer you a glass?

47:16.705 --> 47:17.705
Water's fine.

47:20.074 --> 47:22.242
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:22.276 --> 47:24.746
I'm a wreck, you must
think I'm a crazy person.

47:24.779 --> 47:26.847
No, not at all.

47:26.880 --> 47:30.317
That woman being out
there, all this going on,

47:30.351 --> 47:32.632
I don't think I'd be able to
handle it as well as you are.

47:33.420 --> 47:34.723
Is that what I'm doing?

47:36.090 --> 47:38.526
You seem composed.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.728
On the outside, at least.

47:41.730 --> 47:43.263
Where are you from, Jamie?

47:43.297 --> 47:46.367
That accent is definitely
not upstate New York.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.400
No, it's not.

47:48.969 --> 47:50.538
I grew up in the city,

47:51.706 --> 47:53.974
but my parents are
both from Nigeria, so,

47:55.777 --> 47:58.445
I had that around the house,

47:58.479 --> 48:00.715
and I guess it's
there somewhere.

48:00.749 --> 48:03.217
My friends used
to make fun of me,

48:03.250 --> 48:06.588
said when I had a few
drinks I'd go full Nigerian.

48:06.621 --> 48:07.621
Full Nigerian?

48:08.422 --> 48:09.490
Yeah, it's...

48:10.792 --> 48:11.792
I'd be like...

48:13.293 --> 48:16.598
Miss bowden, I'm very,
very worried about you,

48:16.631 --> 48:18.298
but I don't want
you to be concerned.

48:18.332 --> 48:21.603
I am here to make sure
that you are very safe.

48:21.636 --> 48:23.470
That's pretty good.

48:23.505 --> 48:24.505
Thank you.

48:25.740 --> 48:27.642
So, what brought you to massena?

48:29.844 --> 48:31.679
I followed a girl
out of school, nyu.

48:33.648 --> 48:36.350
I got a job that I liked
doing, so I stayed.

48:37.852 --> 48:39.754
What happened to the girl?

48:39.788 --> 48:41.823
It was good for a while.

48:41.856 --> 48:44.793
But in the end,
her family had a...

48:44.826 --> 48:45.826
How can I put it,

48:47.027 --> 48:49.296
higher aspirations
for their daughter.

48:51.666 --> 48:52.667
So you let her go?

48:53.802 --> 48:54.935
Not really.

48:56.470 --> 48:57.470
I made a choice.

49:01.442 --> 49:02.442
What about you?

49:03.143 --> 49:04.143
Why are you here?

49:06.280 --> 49:08.949
I was born here, I didn't
really have a choice.

49:08.982 --> 49:10.919
But you do now.

49:10.951 --> 49:13.320
With everything that
happened, why stay?

49:17.525 --> 49:18.525
I'm sorry.

49:20.294 --> 49:23.130
It's none of my business.

49:23.163 --> 49:24.465
I'm gonna go back outside.

49:24.498 --> 49:25.498
No, please.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.300
Sit.

49:28.335 --> 49:30.538
I've gotten so used to
keeping it to myself

49:30.572 --> 49:32.874
that I've forgotten what
it's like to talk about it.

49:36.176 --> 49:38.813
I didn't know where I lived,

49:38.847 --> 49:41.014
I didn't know what massena was.

49:41.048 --> 49:43.651
I didn't know anything
but that shack of a house.

49:45.986 --> 49:47.689
My parents were gone, no family,

49:47.722 --> 49:51.225
so the state put me in a
foster home until I was 17.

49:52.927 --> 49:55.329
No one wants the girl
with the fucked up past.

49:56.430 --> 49:59.099
And I left for a while,
I went to school.

50:00.935 --> 50:02.402
But I kept coming back.

50:04.004 --> 50:06.004
And at first I thought it
was because I felt guilty

50:07.407 --> 50:09.009
leaving the others behind.

50:10.177 --> 50:11.779
The other girls in that house.

50:13.213 --> 50:16.518
They didn't get to
leave, so why should I?

50:18.920 --> 50:19.888
But then I realized something,

50:19.921 --> 50:22.089
something that I
couldn't explain

50:22.122 --> 50:25.058
until I started
teaching, then I did.

50:26.861 --> 50:30.532
I wanted to try to
fix what she did here.

50:30.565 --> 50:32.332
The hurt she caused.

50:32.366 --> 50:33.868
Try to be the opposite.

50:35.035 --> 50:37.371
And that's what I'm
trying to do with Lisa.

50:37.404 --> 50:39.106
That young girl at the party?

50:39.941 --> 50:41.009
Yes.

50:41.041 --> 50:42.944
She's a foster child like I was,

50:42.977 --> 50:44.579
she's alone like I was.

50:45.412 --> 50:47.080
So maybe that's why I'm here,

50:47.982 --> 50:49.449
or maybe it's all those things.

50:52.319 --> 50:53.922
Or maybe I'm afraid if I leave

50:53.955 --> 50:55.055
I'll forget who I am.

51:06.601 --> 51:07.802
Hey, what's going on?

51:07.835 --> 51:09.169
Why are the police here again?

51:11.338 --> 51:12.950
There were a couple of
break-ins down the road,

51:12.974 --> 51:15.084
and they just want to keep
an eye on the neighborhood.

51:15.108 --> 51:17.812
They asked if they could
stay out a few nights, so.

51:19.112 --> 51:21.816
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me, Chris?

51:21.849 --> 51:23.818
You seem a little off.

51:23.851 --> 51:25.987
I'm fine, everything's fine.

51:26.020 --> 51:27.287
I just need some sleep.

51:30.157 --> 51:31.157
Bye.

52:07.127 --> 52:08.128
So, you've seen it?

52:09.296 --> 52:10.464
Yeah, a long time ago.

52:11.298 --> 52:12.600
But from what I remember,

52:12.634 --> 52:14.969
it was little Christina
singing some Bible song.

52:15.737 --> 52:17.270
Right.

52:17.304 --> 52:18.506
In the beginning of the tape,

52:18.539 --> 52:20.541
you can hear caulfield say,

52:20.575 --> 52:22.209
"tell him how old you are."

52:23.911 --> 52:25.145
Who's the him?

52:27.081 --> 52:29.149
I don't know.

52:29.182 --> 52:31.218
But from what I remember,

52:31.251 --> 52:33.054
caulfield was kind of a fanatic,

52:33.087 --> 52:34.388
probably talking about Jesus.

52:37.058 --> 52:39.159
And why are you looking at
that stuff anyway, Jamie?

52:40.227 --> 52:42.195
We know what happened
in that house.

52:43.397 --> 52:44.866
I'm keeping an
eye on her, Gerry,

52:44.899 --> 52:46.366
just like you asked me to.

55:33.333 --> 55:34.535
Get up.

55:34.569 --> 55:36.403
Tomorrow.

55:36.436 --> 55:37.672
No, we'll get caught.

55:37.705 --> 55:39.240
Tomorrow we run.

55:39.273 --> 55:41.642
Get up!

57:00.688 --> 57:01.989
Good morning.

57:03.591 --> 57:05.492
I have cream inside,
sugar if you like.

57:05.526 --> 57:06.526
This is fine.

57:07.361 --> 57:08.361
How'd you sleep?

57:09.330 --> 57:10.331
Good.

57:10.364 --> 57:11.364
How about you?

57:12.700 --> 57:15.269
That would kind of defeat
the purpose of being out here.

57:15.303 --> 57:16.304
Right.

57:16.337 --> 57:17.838
Of course.

57:17.872 --> 57:19.907
What happened to your hand?

57:19.941 --> 57:22.743
Oh, I just got it
caught in the door.

57:22.777 --> 57:23.777
It's fine, really.

57:24.879 --> 57:28.416
So, any news?

57:28.448 --> 57:29.650
Yes, actually.

57:29.684 --> 57:31.819
Police found the
tow truck she stole,

57:31.852 --> 57:32.996
it was off the side of the road

57:33.020 --> 57:35.890
about 40 miles southwest
of the accident.

57:36.824 --> 57:37.824
South.

57:38.793 --> 57:39.760
Away from here.

57:39.794 --> 57:41.295
That's good, right?

57:41.329 --> 57:42.964
Better than the other direction.

57:45.866 --> 57:47.768
Well, I better get to work.

57:47.802 --> 57:50.771
Well, you have my
number if you need me.

57:50.805 --> 57:52.807
If not, I'll just see
you back here tonight.

57:55.743 --> 57:57.111
It's funny.

57:57.144 --> 57:59.180
This is the most stable
relationship I've been in.

57:59.213 --> 58:01.282
It's only been two days.

58:01.315 --> 58:02.315
Like I said.

58:59.040 --> 59:00.074
Tom?

59:05.946 --> 59:07.081
Tom, are you here?

59:25.566 --> 59:26.634
Hello?

59:26.667 --> 59:28.069
Hi, Mrs. Foster.

59:28.102 --> 59:29.303
Hey, it's Christina.

59:29.336 --> 59:30.638
Oh, hi.

59:30.671 --> 59:33.240
Yeah, I'm here,
and he's not here.

59:33.274 --> 59:34.875
But his truck is
gone, I think...

59:34.909 --> 59:36.319
Maybe he went skiing
with his friends

59:36.343 --> 59:37.945
and he forgot to tell you?

59:37.978 --> 59:40.448
That would be very unlike him.

59:40.481 --> 59:41.715
But maybe you're right,

59:41.749 --> 59:44.452
maybe he's just
doing something fun.

59:46.987 --> 59:47.987
Christina?

59:49.524 --> 59:51.659
Christina, are you there?

59:52.827 --> 59:54.261
Christina!

59:54.295 --> 59:57.398
Christina, answer me.

59:57.431 --> 59:59.534
She'll hear you!

1:00:01.502 --> 1:00:03.137
She's coming!

1:00:27.661 --> 1:00:29.964
Back bedroom to the left.

1:00:37.404 --> 1:00:39.140
His mother won't
stop calling me.

1:00:42.843 --> 1:00:44.044
He didn't deserve that.

1:00:45.479 --> 1:00:48.649
He was a liar, and a cheat,
but he didn't deserve that.

1:00:51.318 --> 1:00:53.354
When was the last
time you saw him?

1:00:57.158 --> 1:00:58.159
I don't know.

1:00:59.193 --> 1:01:01.362
A week ago I came
by for some stuff.

1:01:04.064 --> 1:01:05.332
Why'd you two break up?

1:01:06.667 --> 1:01:08.969
Because he was
screwing half the town.

1:01:09.003 --> 1:01:10.204
But what does it matter?

1:01:11.405 --> 1:01:12.405
She did this.

1:01:14.275 --> 1:01:16.076
Caulfield?

1:01:16.110 --> 1:01:17.278
You think she did this?

1:01:21.516 --> 1:01:22.516
You don't?

1:01:25.019 --> 1:01:28.222
I'm sorry, but how would
she even know who he is?

1:01:32.293 --> 1:01:33.293
I don't know.

1:01:35.362 --> 1:01:36.697
I understand you're upset,

1:01:38.265 --> 1:01:40.076
and the knee-jerk reaction
is to think that it's her,

1:01:40.100 --> 1:01:43.538
but we don't know what
happened in there.

1:01:45.239 --> 1:01:47.074
You said he was sleeping
with several people,

1:01:47.107 --> 1:01:51.178
this could be someone's
husband, a jealous lover,

1:01:51.212 --> 1:01:53.414
any one of them would
have a reason to do this.

1:01:54.448 --> 1:01:56.083
Did you see that in there?

1:01:57.384 --> 1:02:00.287
Did that look like an
angry soccer mom did that,

1:02:00.321 --> 1:02:02.056
or a jealous husband?

1:02:02.923 --> 1:02:05.694
I don't know who did this,

1:02:05.726 --> 1:02:08.963
but Tom foster never did
anything to Elizabeth caulfield,

1:02:08.996 --> 1:02:11.098
why would she come after him?

1:02:11.131 --> 1:02:12.466
Neither did my sisters,

1:02:12.499 --> 1:02:14.835
but that didn't stop her
from killing them, did it?

1:02:17.505 --> 1:02:19.240
No.

1:02:19.273 --> 1:02:20.273
It didn't.

1:02:23.143 --> 1:02:24.143
Can I go?

1:02:25.346 --> 1:02:26.346
Sure.

1:02:43.330 --> 1:02:46.400
You know who she is, right?

1:02:46.433 --> 1:02:47.669
Of course you do.

1:02:47.702 --> 1:02:49.770
That's why you got those
bags under your eyes.

1:02:51.305 --> 1:02:53.140
Gerry Bailey, still
got you by the balls

1:02:53.173 --> 1:02:54.609
after all these years.

1:02:55.543 --> 1:02:56.611
You know her?

1:02:58.613 --> 1:03:00.447
I was there the
night we found her.

1:03:00.481 --> 1:03:03.117
I'll never forget her face,
20 years later or not.

1:03:06.487 --> 1:03:07.988
She thinks this was caulfield.

1:03:10.525 --> 1:03:11.859
The woman who killed her parents

1:03:11.892 --> 1:03:12.993
just broke out of prison,

1:03:13.027 --> 1:03:15.129
and now her boyfriend's dead?

1:03:15.162 --> 1:03:16.162
Can you blame her?

1:03:18.499 --> 1:03:20.267
Nope.

1:03:20.301 --> 1:03:23.505
But if she's right, then
someone is helping caulfield.

1:03:23.538 --> 1:03:25.806
Who would help her?

1:03:25.839 --> 1:03:26.839
I don't know.

1:03:29.544 --> 1:03:31.378
But I'm gonna find out.

1:03:54.401 --> 1:03:55.369
Hey, no pushing!

1:03:55.402 --> 1:03:56.738
Slow down, Mr. Donovan.

1:03:56.771 --> 1:03:58.673
Matt, have you seen Lisa?

1:03:58.707 --> 1:04:00.207
No, I don't think
she was in today.

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:01.240
Is everything okay?

1:04:02.744 --> 1:04:04.512
Christina, are you okay?

1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:06.614
Where is she?

1:04:08.683 --> 1:04:10.017
Look.

1:04:10.050 --> 1:04:11.562
She said she didn't feel
like going to school today.

1:04:11.586 --> 1:04:14.054
She's been all upset and stuff.

1:04:14.088 --> 1:04:15.356
Any idea why?

1:04:15.389 --> 1:04:16.758
I don't have time for this.

1:04:16.791 --> 1:04:18.693
I just need you tell
me where she is.

1:04:18.727 --> 1:04:21.161
I don't need to do anything.

1:04:21.195 --> 1:04:22.195
Where is she?

1:04:23.097 --> 1:04:24.097
Church.

1:04:24.932 --> 1:04:26.568
She said she was
going to church.

1:04:42.216 --> 1:04:43.216
Lisa?

1:04:44.318 --> 1:04:45.219
What are you doing here?

1:04:45.252 --> 1:04:46.420
I'm looking for you!

1:04:47.955 --> 1:04:49.890
Well, mission
accomplished, you can go home now.

1:04:49.923 --> 1:04:51.593
Whose car is that?

1:04:51.626 --> 1:04:52.727
Leave me alone, okay?

1:04:52.761 --> 1:04:54.696
Lisa, I know you're upset,

1:04:54.729 --> 1:04:56.798
but you can't be here right now.

1:04:56.831 --> 1:04:58.208
I shouldn't told you
what was going on,

1:04:58.232 --> 1:05:00.901
and I will, but you
need to come with me.

1:05:00.934 --> 1:05:01.934
No, thanks.

1:05:02.804 --> 1:05:04.071
Lisa, this is important.

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:07.842
She said no thanks.

1:05:13.347 --> 1:05:15.587
I don't even want to know
what the two of you were doing,

1:05:15.617 --> 1:05:17.585
I just want you out
of here right now.

1:05:17.619 --> 1:05:19.721
Leave me alone, okay?

1:05:19.754 --> 1:05:20.755
I'll get her home.

1:05:22.757 --> 1:05:24.626
How old are you?

1:05:24.659 --> 1:05:25.827
Old enough.

1:05:25.860 --> 1:05:27.127
Old enough to go to jail?

1:05:27.161 --> 1:05:29.163
You know she's a minor?

1:05:29.196 --> 1:05:30.164
What?

1:05:30.197 --> 1:05:31.833
Minor, like 13 years old minor.

1:05:31.866 --> 1:05:33.802
Like if you touch
her, it's rape.

1:05:33.835 --> 1:05:34.736
What are you doing?

1:05:34.769 --> 1:05:36.003
I didn't do anything with her.

1:05:36.036 --> 1:05:37.639
Good.

1:05:37.672 --> 1:05:38.682
You can tell that to the
police once they get here.

1:05:38.706 --> 1:05:39.841
What's wrong with you?

1:05:39.874 --> 1:05:41.609
Get your stuff and let's go.

1:05:42.877 --> 1:05:44.178
I'm not going anywhere.

1:05:48.148 --> 1:05:49.148
Now!

1:05:54.689 --> 1:05:57.357
Are you crazy being up
there alone with that boy,

1:05:57.391 --> 1:05:58.927
skipping class?

1:05:58.959 --> 1:06:00.127
You want to ruin everything?

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:01.328
Me?

1:06:01.361 --> 1:06:02.673
I'm not the one
fucking ruining shit!

1:06:02.697 --> 1:06:03.865
Watch your mouth!

1:06:03.898 --> 1:06:05.208
It's bad enough you
look like a hooker,

1:06:05.232 --> 1:06:06.935
you don't have to
sound like one too.

1:06:06.967 --> 1:06:08.211
I look like a fool,
that's what I look like

1:06:08.235 --> 1:06:10.337
because I believed you!

1:06:10.370 --> 1:06:12.172
You look like a fool?

1:06:12.206 --> 1:06:14.843
I'm trying to show the state
that I can take care of you,

1:06:14.876 --> 1:06:16.845
give you a real home.

1:06:16.878 --> 1:06:18.021
And you want to throw that away

1:06:18.045 --> 1:06:19.647
just so you can suck
face with some loser

1:06:19.681 --> 1:06:20.825
in the middle of the afternoon?

1:06:20.849 --> 1:06:22.282
We were just hanging out,

1:06:22.316 --> 1:06:24.786
and I don't have to listen
to you or the fucking state!

1:06:24.819 --> 1:06:25.820
Stop cursing!

1:06:25.854 --> 1:06:27.120
Fuck you!

1:06:27.154 --> 1:06:28.632
You're not my mother,
so stop acting like it.

1:06:28.656 --> 1:06:29.891
You don't care about me.

1:06:29.924 --> 1:06:31.334
You just want to feel
good about yourself,

1:06:31.358 --> 1:06:33.795
patch up whatever little
fucked up hole you have inside.

1:06:33.828 --> 1:06:36.196
This is just some sick
do-over for you, isn't it?

1:06:36.230 --> 1:06:37.832
Well, you know what?

1:06:37.866 --> 1:06:38.876
I don't need your pity, I
can take care of myself.

1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:40.367
I've been doing
it my whole life.

1:06:45.573 --> 1:06:46.674
Lisa.

1:06:46.708 --> 1:06:48.175
I'm sorry I yelled,

1:06:48.208 --> 1:06:50.186
just please get back in the car
and I'll explain everything.

1:06:50.210 --> 1:06:51.210
Explain this.

1:06:52.514 --> 1:06:53.514
Lisa!

1:07:06.528 --> 1:07:07.996
Miss conley?

1:07:08.028 --> 1:07:09.864
Oh, Christ.

1:07:09.898 --> 1:07:11.599
I thought I was
done with you boys.

1:07:14.903 --> 1:07:18.673
I have made more copies
of the same documents...

1:07:18.706 --> 1:07:20.073
Don't you all share stuff?

1:07:20.975 --> 1:07:22.710
Not as much as you'd imagine.

1:07:26.548 --> 1:07:28.750
Not much in here.

1:07:28.783 --> 1:07:31.719
Initial employment, peer review,

1:07:31.753 --> 1:07:33.387
that type of thing.

1:07:36.056 --> 1:07:37.959
Are you looking for
something specific?

1:07:39.226 --> 1:07:41.663
How long have you worked
at the hospital, miss conley?

1:07:42.964 --> 1:07:44.632
If you're asking
if I was employed

1:07:44.666 --> 1:07:47.001
when she worked here, I was.

1:07:48.736 --> 1:07:50.437
I didn't know her well.

1:07:50.470 --> 1:07:52.239
Seemed like a normal person.

1:07:54.141 --> 1:07:56.811
Took care of those
little babies just fine.

1:07:56.844 --> 1:07:58.556
Oh, there's even letters
in there from parents

1:07:58.580 --> 1:08:01.883
who said she was the best
night mother on the ward.

1:08:01.916 --> 1:08:03.585
Did her job, no problems,

1:08:03.618 --> 1:08:05.118
right up 'til she was fired.

1:08:06.286 --> 1:08:10.090
Says reason for termination
was erratic behavior.

1:08:10.123 --> 1:08:12.660
I know what it says, I wrote it.

1:08:12.694 --> 1:08:14.194
What kind of erratic behavior?

1:08:15.530 --> 1:08:17.364
I don't remember, it
was a long time ago.

1:08:19.667 --> 1:08:21.703
You remembered she
was good at her job.

1:08:22.971 --> 1:08:25.272
You remember these
letters in the file,

1:08:25.305 --> 1:08:28.275
but you don't remember
why she was fired?

1:08:29.276 --> 1:08:32.080
I just did what
I was asked to do.

1:08:32.112 --> 1:08:34.181
They said it was to
protect the hospital.

1:08:36.618 --> 1:08:39.453
Jean, I've got two people
lying in a pool of blood

1:08:39.486 --> 1:08:40.755
not two miles from here.

1:08:40.788 --> 1:08:42.189
There is a chance that caulfield

1:08:42.222 --> 1:08:43.299
had something to do with it,

1:08:43.323 --> 1:08:46.094
and if she did, she had help.

1:08:46.126 --> 1:08:47.829
Possibly from
someone in her past.

1:08:47.862 --> 1:08:50.230
So please, anything you know.

1:08:53.801 --> 1:08:56.938
There was a rumor that
she was having an affair

1:08:56.971 --> 1:08:58.773
with a man who worked
here at the hospital.

1:08:58.806 --> 1:09:00.307
A married man.

1:09:01.174 --> 1:09:02.844
So, they let her go.

1:09:07.682 --> 1:09:11.686
This man, do you have his name?

1:09:11.719 --> 1:09:13.387
Or do you know where
I can find him?

1:09:14.989 --> 1:09:18.225
Up until 5 years ago, he
was wearing your uniform.

1:09:34.108 --> 1:09:35.108
Hey.

1:09:37.344 --> 1:09:39.246
Well, look who it is.

1:09:39.279 --> 1:09:40.279
Hey yourself.

1:09:46.386 --> 1:09:49.924
I'm guessing you didn't
come by to see me and mom.

1:09:52.060 --> 1:09:53.060
No.

1:09:54.729 --> 1:09:55.730
We got in an argument.

1:09:55.763 --> 1:09:57.364
Oh.

1:09:57.397 --> 1:09:58.942
And I'm worried she's
gonna do something stupid.

1:09:58.966 --> 1:10:00.802
Yeah, well, she's not here.

1:10:01.636 --> 1:10:02.904
But she'll turn up.

1:10:02.937 --> 1:10:04.081
I mean, probably in
the back of a cop car,

1:10:04.105 --> 1:10:05.973
but she always comes back.

1:10:08.109 --> 1:10:09.242
She's a good kid.

1:10:10.243 --> 1:10:11.278
Yeah, well, you know,

1:10:11.311 --> 1:10:12.547
if she doesn't straighten out,

1:10:12.580 --> 1:10:14.281
she's gonna end up
just like her mother.

1:10:15.616 --> 1:10:17.217
Is that what you're doing?

1:10:17.250 --> 1:10:18.251
Straightening her out,

1:10:18.285 --> 1:10:20.088
keeping in her room
for hours on end?

1:10:20.121 --> 1:10:21.121
Oh, look.

1:10:22.123 --> 1:10:24.859
You break the rules, you
get the consequences.

1:10:24.892 --> 1:10:26.127
That's how it is in my house,

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:28.328
that's how it is in the
world, you know that.

1:10:29.296 --> 1:10:30.430
But hey, you know what?

1:10:30.464 --> 1:10:31.474
School's gonna be over soon.

1:10:31.498 --> 1:10:32.900
And she'll be my
problem, not yours,

1:10:32.934 --> 1:10:34.468
you don't have to
worry about it.

1:10:36.904 --> 1:10:39.073
She's not gonna be
your problem for long.

1:10:44.612 --> 1:10:45.613
Oh my god.

1:10:47.314 --> 1:10:49.150
It's you, ain't it?

1:10:50.450 --> 1:10:54.088
The social worker told me
there was somebody interested.

1:10:55.590 --> 1:10:57.324
That's what this
is about, right?

1:10:57.357 --> 1:10:59.326
I mean, you're
trying to adopt her.

1:10:59.359 --> 1:11:01.129
Yeah, she deserves
a real family.

1:11:01.162 --> 1:11:02.496
She has a real family!

1:11:03.931 --> 1:11:08.169
God, I mean nobody else
wanted that girl, no one!

1:11:09.436 --> 1:11:11.438
We took her in, we
gave her a home,

1:11:11.471 --> 1:11:13.941
we gave her a family,
just like you!

1:11:13.975 --> 1:11:16.811
She's a paycheck to
you, and you know it,

1:11:16.844 --> 1:11:18.079
just like I was!

1:11:18.112 --> 1:11:19.680
We gave you everything we had!

1:11:21.616 --> 1:11:22.616
Yeah.

1:11:23.483 --> 1:11:24.619
I know.

1:11:24.652 --> 1:11:26.821
I remember everything
you gave me.

1:11:32.359 --> 1:11:33.359
I...

1:11:34.562 --> 1:11:37.165
I have not had a
drink in 10 years,

1:11:38.365 --> 1:11:41.202
and I have never laid
a hand on that girl.

1:11:41.235 --> 1:11:42.637
Yeah, and you never will.

1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:46.840
Please.

1:11:48.709 --> 1:11:51.045
We got nothing else
coming in, right?

1:11:51.913 --> 1:11:54.081
I mean, she's all we got.

1:11:56.517 --> 1:11:57.517
Yeah.

1:11:59.153 --> 1:12:01.656
Well, that makes two of us.

1:12:01.689 --> 1:12:02.690
Does she know?

1:12:04.592 --> 1:12:05.592
About you?

1:12:09.564 --> 1:12:12.300
What do you think she
says when she finds out,

1:12:12.332 --> 1:12:14.101
when she finds out
the truth about you?

1:12:15.536 --> 1:12:16.938
I mean, we all got our secrets.

1:12:20.074 --> 1:12:22.577
What do you think she says
when she finds out yours?

1:12:42.063 --> 1:12:43.231
Hello?

1:12:43.264 --> 1:12:44.397
Hello, Mrs. Bailey?

1:12:44.431 --> 1:12:45.700
This is Jamie nwosu.

1:12:45.733 --> 1:12:47.134
Can I speak with Gerry, please?

1:12:49.570 --> 1:12:51.138
My husband is resting.

1:12:52.439 --> 1:12:53.473
This is important.

1:12:54.308 --> 1:12:56.277
My husband is not well,

1:12:56.310 --> 1:12:59.881
and I would appreciate it if
you don't call here anymore.

1:12:59.914 --> 1:13:00.914
Goodnight.

1:13:56.837 --> 1:13:58.005
Where are you?

1:13:59.540 --> 1:14:01.409
I'm here.

1:14:01.441 --> 1:14:02.310
Are you okay?

1:14:02.343 --> 1:14:03.353
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1:14:03.377 --> 1:14:04.712
I'm fine, it's okay.

1:14:05.713 --> 1:14:08.649
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said what I said.

1:14:08.683 --> 1:14:10.952
It's fine,
I'm just happy you're safe.

1:14:10.985 --> 1:14:14.622
But he told me these
things about you.

1:14:17.825 --> 1:14:19.694
What did he tell you?

1:14:56.430 --> 1:14:57.198
Goodnight.

1:14:57.231 --> 1:14:58.232
Goodnight.

1:15:17.852 --> 1:15:19.887
What's wrong?

1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:21.489
I don't know.

1:15:21.522 --> 1:15:23.924
I thought I heard something.

1:16:06.801 --> 1:16:08.469
It was just the girl.

1:16:09.770 --> 1:16:12.573
I'll deal with her
in the morning.

1:16:14.509 --> 1:16:15.509
What...

1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:20.114
Eileen...

1:16:21.415 --> 1:16:22.415
Oh my god.

1:19:39.714 --> 1:19:40.615
Christina.

1:19:40.649 --> 1:19:42.449
Christina bowden.

1:19:42.483 --> 1:19:43.483
Christina.

1:19:44.051 --> 1:19:45.486
Get up.

1:20:28.228 --> 1:20:29.830
And he just landed.

1:20:29.863 --> 1:20:31.207
The state police has
got a search party

1:20:31.231 --> 1:20:33.133
looking for the girl already.

1:20:33.167 --> 1:20:34.134
I think you should get over-

1:20:34.168 --> 1:20:35.402
- you were in my house!

1:20:35.436 --> 1:20:37.639
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1:20:37.672 --> 1:20:38.540
No one comes in there!

1:20:38.573 --> 1:20:39.840
Do you understand me?

1:20:39.873 --> 1:20:41.475
Christina, something
happened last night.

1:20:41.509 --> 1:20:42.711
I want you gone!

1:20:44.211 --> 1:20:46.847
Terry Caldwell and his wife
were murdered last night.

1:20:50.250 --> 1:20:51.385
Lisa.

1:20:51.418 --> 1:20:52.654
She wasn't in the house,

1:20:52.687 --> 1:20:54.656
and I have people
looking for her.

1:20:54.689 --> 1:20:56.857
But I need you to
help me understand

1:20:56.890 --> 1:20:59.661
why someone would want
to hurt the Caldwells.

1:20:59.694 --> 1:21:01.028
Someone?

1:21:01.061 --> 1:21:02.664
This is her.

1:21:02.697 --> 1:21:03.430
Can't you see that?

1:21:03.464 --> 1:21:04.566
No, I can't.

1:21:05.533 --> 1:21:06.867
But it seems like you can,

1:21:06.900 --> 1:21:10.572
so please, help me understand
why she would do this?

1:21:12.741 --> 1:21:13.741
I don't know.

1:21:15.109 --> 1:21:18.847
Christina, I have four people
dead in the last 24 hours,

1:21:18.879 --> 1:21:20.123
and they're all
connected to you.

1:21:20.147 --> 1:21:21.915
So you need to tell
me, what is going on!

1:21:21.949 --> 1:21:22.949
I don't know!

1:21:32.794 --> 1:21:34.962
Where were you last night?

1:21:37.131 --> 1:21:38.131
Fuck you.

1:21:39.266 --> 1:21:40.578
You didn't get home
'til after midnight.

1:21:40.602 --> 1:21:41.468
Where were you?

1:21:41.502 --> 1:21:42.804
I was looking for Lisa!

1:21:42.837 --> 1:21:44.548
So you went looking
for her at the Caldwells?

1:21:44.572 --> 1:21:46.073
This wasn't me, Jamie!

1:21:46.106 --> 1:21:47.642
Right, it's caulfield.

1:21:47.675 --> 1:21:50.477
And she somehow magically knows
everything about your life,

1:21:50.512 --> 1:21:51.979
about Lisa, about Tom,

1:21:52.012 --> 1:21:53.280
and she's killing everyone

1:21:53.313 --> 1:21:54.849
who ever wronged
her special girl.

1:21:57.985 --> 1:22:00.320
I've been sitting in
front of the wrong house.

1:22:01.689 --> 1:22:03.591
You were never in
danger, were you?

1:22:06.828 --> 1:22:09.664
She could've killed you
back then, but she didn't,

1:22:11.633 --> 1:22:14.001
because you were her favorite.

1:22:15.670 --> 1:22:18.773
That's why you're alive
and the others aren't.

1:22:21.543 --> 1:22:23.778
You don't know
anything about me,

1:22:23.812 --> 1:22:25.513
or what went on in that house.

1:22:29.483 --> 1:22:32.052
I know when someone
is lying to me.

1:22:35.824 --> 1:22:36.824
Tell me, Jamie.

1:22:37.559 --> 1:22:38.992
Was Gerry Bailey lying to you

1:22:39.026 --> 1:22:40.895
when he asked you
to come find me?

1:22:41.830 --> 1:22:43.898
Did he tell you he
was worried about me?

1:22:46.835 --> 1:22:48.536
You don't think I know?

1:22:49.804 --> 1:22:51.539
That old man drives by
my house once a week,

1:22:51.573 --> 1:22:53.173
sends me birthday
cards in the mail,

1:22:53.207 --> 1:22:55.643
and it's not because he
gives a shit about me.

1:22:56.878 --> 1:22:58.479
It's because he feels guilty.

1:22:58.513 --> 1:22:59.480
Well, fuck him!

1:22:59.514 --> 1:23:00.849
He should feel guilty.

1:23:03.383 --> 1:23:05.285
He was supposed to protect us,

1:23:05.319 --> 1:23:08.690
he was supposed to save
us, but nobody came.

1:23:09.891 --> 1:23:10.891
No one!

1:23:13.928 --> 1:23:16.463
Or maybe you did
know he was lying,

1:23:16.497 --> 1:23:18.131
and you came anyway,

1:23:18.165 --> 1:23:19.801
hoping you could prove to him

1:23:19.834 --> 1:23:22.202
that you were good enough
for his precious daughter.

1:23:24.037 --> 1:23:26.741
Whatever you're here for,
it's not for me, is it?

1:23:26.774 --> 1:23:29.744
Go home, Jamie, and stop
pretending like you care.

1:24:23.497 --> 1:24:24.497
Lisa?

1:24:27.902 --> 1:24:31.873
Lisa!

1:24:31.906 --> 1:24:36.911
Lisa, are you in here?

1:24:54.829 --> 1:24:55.829
Lisa?

1:25:00.868 --> 1:25:04.271
Hey!

1:25:04.304 --> 1:25:08.676
Hey, wake up, you
can't be up here.

1:25:08.710 --> 1:25:09.777
Hey!

1:25:09.811 --> 1:25:10.945
Hey, wake up.

1:25:20.021 --> 1:25:23.123
Oh my god.

1:25:23.156 --> 1:25:24.156
Katie.

1:25:28.563 --> 1:25:31.131
What's wrong with you?

1:25:53.487 --> 1:25:54.589
Come on, run!

1:26:01.095 --> 1:26:03.163
Come on, we have to go, now!

1:26:04.732 --> 1:26:06.199
I can't.

1:26:06.233 --> 1:26:08.036
I'm not leaving you.

1:26:08.069 --> 1:26:10.705
Christina!

1:26:10.738 --> 1:26:11.738
Go, run!

1:26:16.577 --> 1:26:18.579
Christina!

1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:21.281
No!

1:26:22.550 --> 1:26:23.751
No!

1:26:23.785 --> 1:26:26.587
Do you know the rules?

1:26:29.289 --> 1:26:31.092
Do you know the rules?

1:26:31.125 --> 1:26:32.325
No, no!

1:26:32.359 --> 1:26:33.861
Run!

1:26:33.895 --> 1:26:34.895
Christina!

1:26:38.066 --> 1:26:39.266
I'm not leaving you.

1:26:39.299 --> 1:26:40.367
Ask him why he hates you.

1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:41.268
What do you think she says

1:26:41.301 --> 1:26:42.704
when she finds out yours?

1:26:50.477 --> 1:26:51.797
Ask him why
he keeps you a secret.

1:27:03.256 --> 1:27:06.326
Jesus, I'm
sure, because he tells me so.

1:27:17.004 --> 1:27:18.940
Because he tells me so.

1:27:21.809 --> 1:27:23.243
What the hell?

1:27:26.514 --> 1:27:28.315
No one but the kid.

1:27:33.121 --> 1:27:34.321
I saw her, Jamie.

1:27:35.590 --> 1:27:37.357
She was right in
front of my face.

1:27:41.195 --> 1:27:42.195
Who's the boy?

1:27:44.932 --> 1:27:47.434
He was up here
yesterday with Lisa.

1:27:47.467 --> 1:27:48.579
They were making
out or something,

1:27:48.603 --> 1:27:49.604
I told him to leave.

1:27:54.542 --> 1:27:56.110
This is my fault.

1:27:57.277 --> 1:27:59.113
I should've never
shown Lisa this place.

1:28:01.649 --> 1:28:03.017
Why would she come here?

1:28:05.153 --> 1:28:06.429
A mile and a half of those woods

1:28:06.453 --> 1:28:07.855
is where we lived with her.

1:28:09.456 --> 1:28:10.456
Mother's house.

1:28:11.324 --> 1:28:12.324
Mother?

1:28:14.327 --> 1:28:15.395
It's what we called her.

1:28:16.631 --> 1:28:18.331
It's what she was to
me, to the others,

1:28:18.365 --> 1:28:19.365
it's all we knew.

1:28:20.467 --> 1:28:21.645
When there was an evening mass,

1:28:21.669 --> 1:28:23.971
she would take us to the woods,

1:28:24.005 --> 1:28:25.372
and we would sit in the dark,

1:28:25.405 --> 1:28:27.508
not making a sound, and we
would listen to the choir.

1:28:28.543 --> 1:28:29.543
It was beautiful.

1:28:31.145 --> 1:28:32.145
Gave us hope.

1:28:33.514 --> 1:28:36.316
It let me know that there was
a world outside that house.

1:28:37.819 --> 1:28:38.819
Christina, look.

1:28:42.056 --> 1:28:43.724
I'm sorry about the four.

1:28:44.992 --> 1:28:47.028
But something does not add up.

1:28:48.162 --> 1:28:49.697
Because if caulfield
is doing this,

1:28:49.730 --> 1:28:52.200
then someone is helping her.

1:28:52.233 --> 1:28:55.536
Someone who knows about
you, about Tom, about Lisa.

1:28:56.838 --> 1:28:59.507
Do you have any idea who
could be helping her?

1:29:01.042 --> 1:29:02.210
Only one person.

1:29:07.414 --> 1:29:08.414
Me.

1:29:10.952 --> 1:29:12.553
What are you talking about?

1:29:15.422 --> 1:29:17.424
I wrote to her when
she was in prison,

1:29:18.793 --> 1:29:21.963
told her about Tom,
about the Caldwells.

1:29:23.564 --> 1:29:24.899
I wrote her when I was 15,

1:29:24.932 --> 1:29:28.435
and I wrote her a letter
every month since then.

1:29:30.938 --> 1:29:31.938
Why?

1:29:33.274 --> 1:29:34.274
I don't know.

1:29:35.910 --> 1:29:37.645
'Cause I wanted to
be a good person?

1:29:39.479 --> 1:29:40.915
'Cause I wanted to forgive her?

1:29:42.583 --> 1:29:44.652
Because I had no
one else to talk to?

1:29:45.953 --> 1:29:48.656
No one else knew what
happened to me in that house.

1:29:49.724 --> 1:29:50.958
No one else but her.

1:29:53.327 --> 1:29:54.327
Jamie?

1:30:08.175 --> 1:30:09.175
We found her.

1:30:27.628 --> 1:30:28.628
Christina.

1:30:30.097 --> 1:30:31.097
Christina.

1:30:34.434 --> 1:30:36.804
Maybe you don't need to do this.

1:30:36.837 --> 1:30:37.837
Not right now.

1:31:12.673 --> 1:31:14.742
Top of that ravine
must be 60 feet high.

1:31:16.677 --> 1:31:18.813
In that dark, she'd
never have seen the drop.

1:32:03.791 --> 1:32:04.791
Christina.

1:32:05.426 --> 1:32:06.426
Christina, wait.

1:32:07.862 --> 1:32:08.862
I'm going home.

1:32:10.064 --> 1:32:12.266
Let me get someone
to follow you home.

1:32:12.299 --> 1:32:13.601
We don't know where she is,

1:32:13.634 --> 1:32:15.603
she could be waiting
for you right now.

1:32:15.636 --> 1:32:16.937
I don't care.

1:32:22.209 --> 1:32:23.878
I'm gonna have to
call you back, Casey.

1:32:23.911 --> 1:32:25.012
No, Jamie, wait.

1:32:25.046 --> 1:32:26.113
This is important.

1:32:27.314 --> 1:32:29.250
You need to see
something on this tape.

1:32:44.632 --> 1:32:46.600
Where are you?

1:32:51.138 --> 1:32:53.974
I'm not running anymore!

1:32:54.008 --> 1:32:55.009
Come get me!

1:32:56.143 --> 1:32:57.945
I'm right here!

1:33:02.316 --> 1:33:03.651
I'm right here!

1:33:04.452 --> 1:33:07.254
Christina!

1:33:22.436 --> 1:33:24.638
I'm right here.

1:33:24.672 --> 1:33:25.973
I'm right here.

1:33:27.341 --> 1:33:28.409
Right here.

1:33:28.442 --> 1:33:29.578
Christina?

1:33:31.679 --> 1:33:32.813
Is this a bad time?

1:33:37.151 --> 1:33:38.151
No.

1:33:38.819 --> 1:33:39.819
Come on in.

1:33:44.125 --> 1:33:45.626
Jesus loves me, this I know,

1:33:47.361 --> 1:33:49.296
because the Bible-

1:33:49.330 --> 1:33:51.332
- I cleaned up the tape
and got the time code.

1:33:51.365 --> 1:33:53.467
It's November 18th, 1998.

1:33:54.702 --> 1:33:56.170
One week before
Christina escaped.

1:33:56.203 --> 1:33:57.505
Yeah.

1:33:57.539 --> 1:33:59.006
And all the other
girls in the house

1:33:59.039 --> 1:34:00.841
were dead at this point, right?

1:34:00.875 --> 1:34:02.343
Right.

1:34:02.376 --> 1:34:03.545
Well, check out what happens

1:34:03.578 --> 1:34:06.180
when you get to 12:31:42
on the time code.

1:34:08.682 --> 1:34:11.652
Loves me, this I'm sure,
because he tells me so.

1:34:11.685 --> 1:34:14.188
See that picture,
next to the timestamp?

1:34:14.221 --> 1:34:15.289
Yeah.

1:34:15.322 --> 1:34:17.526
It's not a picture,
that's a mirror.

1:34:19.326 --> 1:34:21.896
Because the Bible tells me so.

1:34:27.268 --> 1:34:29.069
There's another
girl in that house.

1:34:34.576 --> 1:34:37.278
So, I was coming
for the home visit,

1:34:38.445 --> 1:34:39.557
but I got some news
on the way here,

1:34:39.581 --> 1:34:41.348
and I'm afraid it's bad news.

1:34:43.518 --> 1:34:44.661
I know you've put
a lot of effort

1:34:44.685 --> 1:34:46.220
into this process with Lisa,

1:34:47.421 --> 1:34:51.025
but unfortunately, I don't
think this is going to work out.

1:34:51.058 --> 1:34:52.058
And why is that?

1:34:53.093 --> 1:34:54.361
You lied to me.

1:34:54.395 --> 1:34:55.772
You never told me
about being arrested

1:34:55.796 --> 1:34:57.364
for assault in Florida.

1:34:57.398 --> 1:34:59.500
I was a teenager.

1:34:59.534 --> 1:35:00.701
I was sleepwalking.

1:35:02.203 --> 1:35:04.772
You beat your roommate
with a broom handle.

1:35:04.805 --> 1:35:08.342
The police report said she
needed to be hospitalized.

1:35:08.375 --> 1:35:09.544
You did that in your sleep?

1:35:10.545 --> 1:35:11.946
And even if you did,

1:35:11.979 --> 1:35:14.014
I've got a newsflash
for you, miss bowden,

1:35:14.048 --> 1:35:16.250
that's something you
needed to tell me.

1:35:21.623 --> 1:35:22.623
She's dead.

1:35:23.991 --> 1:35:24.892
What?

1:35:24.925 --> 1:35:25.560
What are you talking about?

1:35:25.594 --> 1:35:27.361
Lisa is dead.

1:35:27.394 --> 1:35:30.931
And if you would've done
your job, she'd be alive.

1:35:30.965 --> 1:35:32.233
She would've been with me,

1:35:32.266 --> 1:35:34.401
and she would've never
been in that house.

1:35:34.435 --> 1:35:35.970
Oh my god.

1:35:36.003 --> 1:35:37.938
She would be alive.

1:35:37.972 --> 1:35:41.408
But instead she's dead,
and it's your fault.

1:35:41.442 --> 1:35:43.277
Well, no, no it isn't.

1:35:44.512 --> 1:35:47.047
If you just told me the
truth at the very beginning,

1:35:47.081 --> 1:35:48.182
I could've helped you.

1:35:49.517 --> 1:35:50.484
I'm sorry, Christina.

1:35:50.518 --> 1:35:52.820
But this is your
fault, not mine.

1:35:52.853 --> 1:35:54.188
Newsflash...

1:35:56.023 --> 1:35:58.325
That's not my fucking name.

1:36:28.222 --> 1:36:29.222
No!

1:36:30.190 --> 1:36:31.190
No!

1:36:49.476 --> 1:36:50.512
No!

1:36:52.813 --> 1:36:53.813
No!

1:38:25.740 --> 1:38:27.742
She was my best friend.

1:38:27.776 --> 1:38:29.209
She was everything I wasn't.

1:38:29.243 --> 1:38:31.780
She was brave, and kind.

1:38:33.914 --> 1:38:35.449
I wanted to be her, Jamie.

1:38:38.653 --> 1:38:40.622
But instead, I got her killed.

1:38:43.858 --> 1:38:45.693
There was a sixth
girl in that house.

1:38:48.663 --> 1:38:49.663
Yes.

1:38:51.833 --> 1:38:53.868
The only one that
actually belonged here.

1:38:56.003 --> 1:38:57.337
Katie caulfield.

1:38:58.807 --> 1:39:00.107
The serial killer's daughter.

1:39:03.177 --> 1:39:05.012
Why didn't you tell someone?

1:39:08.683 --> 1:39:10.284
Because I was afraid.

1:39:12.386 --> 1:39:15.790
"It was my fault, it
was all my fault."

1:39:15.824 --> 1:39:17.859
That's what she told
me, and I believed her.

1:39:21.061 --> 1:39:23.363
But this is the last
secret of this house.

1:39:26.734 --> 1:39:29.203
To this day, she's
still keeping a secret.

1:39:29.236 --> 1:39:31.706
That's why she's
doing it, Jamie.

1:39:31.739 --> 1:39:33.508
The Caldwells knew, Tom knew.

1:39:34.709 --> 1:39:36.711
But now everyone knows
she can't kill everyone.

1:39:36.744 --> 1:39:37.846
Caulfield is dead.

1:39:40.981 --> 1:39:42.650
They found her body
a few hours ago

1:39:42.684 --> 1:39:44.953
in the woods outside
ulster county.

1:39:44.985 --> 1:39:46.688
She'd been there
at least two days.

1:39:46.721 --> 1:39:47.722
That's impossible!

1:39:49.591 --> 1:39:51.693
Who would kill
Tom, the Caldwells.

1:39:51.726 --> 1:39:53.026
Who would do this?

1:39:58.999 --> 1:40:00.033
No!

1:40:05.540 --> 1:40:06.541
I'm sorry.

1:40:08.375 --> 1:40:10.845
But I need you to come with me.

1:40:10.879 --> 1:40:12.680
Jamie, I didn't hurt anyone.

1:40:14.849 --> 1:40:15.849
Then who did?

1:40:17.852 --> 1:40:21.723
Jesus loves me, this I know,

1:40:21.756 --> 1:40:24.124
because the Bible tells me so.

1:40:25.894 --> 1:40:28.262
Tell him how old you are today.

1:40:29.531 --> 1:40:31.866
I'm 10 years old today.

1:40:34.234 --> 1:40:36.136
Ask him why he hates you.

1:40:39.072 --> 1:40:41.643
Ask him why he
keeps you a secret.

1:40:53.955 --> 1:40:57.090
My parents
are lonely, but never alone,

1:40:57.124 --> 1:40:59.426
for the Bible tells me so.

1:41:09.003 --> 1:41:11.606
I know because he tells me so.

1:41:14.074 --> 1:41:15.074
Arlene?

1:41:19.581 --> 1:41:20.949
Arlene, did you hear that?

1:41:25.152 --> 1:41:26.186
Dad?

1:41:32.092 --> 1:41:34.062
Amy, call the police.

1:41:34.094 --> 1:41:35.063
What's going on?

1:41:35.095 --> 1:41:36.330
Now!

1:42:01.889 --> 1:42:04.959
Please, please
answer, please answer.

1:42:12.734 --> 1:42:13.500
Amy.

1:42:13.534 --> 1:42:14.534
Jamie.

1:42:15.536 --> 1:42:17.105
Jamie.

1:42:17.137 --> 1:42:18.606
Jamie, she's here, she shot dad.

1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:19.373
Who?

1:42:19.406 --> 1:42:20.675
Who's dead?

1:42:20.708 --> 1:42:21.542
You have to come here right now!

1:42:21.576 --> 1:42:23.111
Amy!

1:42:25.079 --> 1:42:26.114
Help me!

1:42:26.146 --> 1:42:27.381
Somebody help me!

1:42:29.383 --> 1:42:30.384
Please help!

1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:33.720
Help!

1:42:36.090 --> 1:42:38.559
Somebody please help me!

1:44:13.821 --> 1:44:18.425
Get out!

1:44:18.458 --> 1:44:19.493
Get out!

1:44:22.630 --> 1:44:24.999
Get out of my house!

1:44:32.339 --> 1:44:33.373
Get out!

1:44:38.546 --> 1:44:39.546
Get out!

1:44:41.381 --> 1:44:42.449
Get out!

1:44:44.384 --> 1:44:46.754
Get out of my house!

1:45:22.089 --> 1:45:24.592
Stay here, stay in the car.

1:46:30.423 --> 1:46:32.093
Help!

1:46:32.126 --> 1:46:37.131
Amy!

1:46:37.632 --> 1:46:38.431
Help me!

1:46:38.465 --> 1:46:39.634
I'm dying.

1:46:39.667 --> 1:46:40.667
Amy?

1:47:02.623 --> 1:47:03.623
Jamie.

1:47:05.660 --> 1:47:06.928
She took my baby.

1:47:16.938 --> 1:47:17.805
Don't go anywhere.

1:47:17.838 --> 1:47:18.739
Don't go anywhere!

1:47:18.773 --> 1:47:20.508
Stay with me, Amy.

1:47:20.541 --> 1:47:23.144
I need an ambulance,
12 conners Lane.

1:47:23.177 --> 1:47:24.779
Gerry Bailey's house!

1:47:24.812 --> 1:47:25.846
Come on.

1:47:29.884 --> 1:47:30.952
He's coming over here.

1:47:30.985 --> 1:47:33.387
The ambulance is on its way.

1:47:34.622 --> 1:47:36.489
Amy, Amy, stay with me.

1:47:37.525 --> 1:47:38.525
Amy!

1:47:45.967 --> 1:47:46.968
I'm sorry.

1:47:49.070 --> 1:47:51.072
I can't do this anymore.

1:47:53.374 --> 1:47:57.078
I need to let you go,
and I need this to end.

1:47:58.746 --> 1:47:59.746
Goodbye.

1:49:39.980 --> 1:49:41.015
She's yours.

1:49:50.124 --> 1:49:52.126
She's a beautiful baby girl.

1:49:53.994 --> 1:49:55.463
Just for you.

1:49:55.496 --> 1:49:57.665
She's pure, and innocent.

1:50:01.302 --> 1:50:04.171
Not like that trashy girl
you wanted to take in.

1:50:06.006 --> 1:50:07.875
So now you have
everything you wanted.

1:50:11.546 --> 1:50:13.548
You gonna say thank you?

1:50:20.054 --> 1:50:23.491
Say thank you for everything
I ever did for you?

1:50:23.525 --> 1:50:26.861
For everything I
sacrificed for you?

1:50:26.894 --> 1:50:29.296
All of this is because of you!

1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:40.875
Christina!

1:50:40.908 --> 1:50:43.043
Christina, where are you?

1:50:45.146 --> 1:50:47.181
Say fucking thank you!

1:50:53.220 --> 1:50:55.689
It's okay, I'm here.

1:50:55.723 --> 1:50:58.560
Can you tell me your name?

1:50:58.593 --> 1:51:00.861
She's coming.

1:51:02.229 --> 1:51:06.834
Now pick up that
perfect fucking baby

1:51:06.867 --> 1:51:09.236
and say fucking thank you!

1:51:17.244 --> 1:51:18.245
Thank you, mother.

1:51:27.622 --> 1:51:28.622
For everything.

1:51:29.591 --> 1:51:32.259
For making me realize
it's not about me,

1:51:32.293 --> 1:51:33.628
it's always been you.

1:51:42.736 --> 1:51:46.340
You're just like your mother.

1:51:46.373 --> 1:51:47.708
No.

1:51:47.741 --> 1:51:48.809
Not like you.

1:51:50.110 --> 1:51:52.279
You're sick, and I'm not.

1:51:53.247 --> 1:51:55.783
I know what love
is, and you don't.

1:51:57.051 --> 1:51:59.787
And I know what it feels
like to lose everything

1:51:59.820 --> 1:52:01.455
that's ever mattered to me.

1:52:05.392 --> 1:52:07.161
At least we have
that in common now.

1:52:11.899 --> 1:52:13.801
Goodbye, mother.

1:52:26.780 --> 1:52:28.650
Don't move!

1:52:34.822 --> 1:52:37.324
You don't get to run this time!

1:53:21.536 --> 1:53:23.638
Are you okay?

1:53:25.540 --> 1:53:27.374
We're gonna get you and
your baby checked out.

1:53:28.842 --> 1:53:30.210
Can you tell me your name?

1:53:32.580 --> 1:53:33.580
Katie.

1:53:34.848 --> 1:53:35.848
My name is Katie.
