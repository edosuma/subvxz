13:26.490 --> 13:27.990
Aha!

13:35.560 --> 13:38.760
This is your idea of
a fun vacation activity?

13:38.830 --> 13:39.990
Doing nothing?

13:40.060 --> 13:42.000
It's not just doing nothin'.

13:42.060 --> 13:46.370
It's doing nothin' with new age
music playing in the background.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.910
You gonna eat your salad?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.110

14:06.520 --> 14:08.620
[Heart thumping]

14:08.690 --> 14:11.460
Maybe a beauty day
is just what I need.

14:11.530 --> 14:12.960
Beauty day?

14:13.030 --> 14:16.170
You need a month
just for your eyebrows.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.600
[Both sigh]

14:27.480 --> 14:30.650
Joe? I don't want
a massage from Joe.

14:30.710 --> 14:33.150
You take him. Off you go.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.690
I want Leslie.

14:37.820 --> 14:39.320
You must be Leslie.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.660
No, I'm Josephine.

14:42.730 --> 14:44.660
Joe for short.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.860
Well, then who's Leslie?

14:50.500 --> 14:53.600
I'm Leslie. Where do you
hold your stress?

14:53.670 --> 14:57.040
[Grunting]

14:57.110 --> 14:59.980
You're like one big knot.

15:35.850 --> 15:39.320
The only thing better than
doing nothing to new age music

15:39.380 --> 15:41.650
is doing nothing
to new age music

15:41.720 --> 15:44.050
in a 160-degree sauna.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.990
It's not hot enough.

15:46.060 --> 15:48.160
My back is killing me.

15:48.230 --> 15:50.260
Put more heat on!

15:50.330 --> 15:52.100
What's the magic word?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.000
I'm dyin'!

15:54.070 --> 15:55.430
Sorry.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.870
The correct answer
was "please."

15:57.940 --> 16:00.440
I also would have
accepted "shazam."

16:00.500 --> 16:02.440
[Growls] Give me that.

16:02.510 --> 16:05.840
If you want something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

Well, time's up, doc.
You better get out.

16:43.550 --> 16:45.250
Oh, no.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.090
I'm gonna soak
in these minerals

16:47.150 --> 16:48.750

16:48.820 --> 16:50.660
what's-her-face

16:50.720 --> 16:53.160
