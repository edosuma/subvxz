the car keys?

00:03.203 --> 00:05.437
- Do I have the car keys?
No. No.

00:05.472 --> 00:08.540
But according
to the sign-out sheet,

00:08.575 --> 00:11.076
I was the last person
to use the car.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.444
- Well, that's not very
helpful, John.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.579
You're the only one using
the sign-out sheet.

00:14.614 --> 00:15.981
- Well, that's not true.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.416
Stevie's got her name
on the sheet.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.184
Wait a minute, why is Stevies
name on the sheet?

00:19.219 --> 00:20.585
She's got her own car.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.854
- David! Do you know
where the car keys are?

00:22.889 --> 00:24.322
- Yeah, I have them.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.525
- Oh, well, then why isn't your
name on the sign-out sheet.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.960
- Because you're the only one
using that sign-out sheet.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.762
- David, I need the car keys,

00:30.797 --> 00:32.998
your father is driving me
to Thornbridge.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.366
- I'm driving you
to Thornbridge?

00:34.401 --> 00:36.501
- To that municipalities
conference. Yes.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.403
- I thought Roland
offered to drive you.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.338
- Oh, he did. But no thanks.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.274
I can't take four hours
in the truck with Roland

00:42.309 --> 00:44.009
and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.544
- Okay, Alexis and I need
the car,

00:45.579 --> 00:47.612
we're running some errands
for the store today.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.181
- Um, since when?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.949
- Uh, since I need help
for a pick-up.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.551
And mom clearly already
has a lift,

00:52.586 --> 00:54.419
and I'm pretty sure parents
are supposed to

00:54.454 --> 00:56.121
put their children
before themselves.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.623
- Oh really? No.

00:58.658 --> 00:59.991
If airplane safety videos have
taught me anything, David,

01:00.026 --> 01:01.893
it's that a mother
puts her own mask on first.

01:01.928 --> 01:05.430
- Ah, see, and that's precisely
why we have the sign-out sheet.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.898
For this kind of dispute.

01:06.933 --> 01:08.366
- Okay. Fine.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.370
Now my name is on the list.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.441
And there's a sheep farm that's
expecting us in 20 minutes

01:16.476 --> 01:18.110
for a pick-up of wool throws.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.544
- No, no, no. No, no.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.613
Your mother already expressed
a verbal intention

01:21.648 --> 01:22.881
to use the car.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.016
- Okay, we're gonna have
the car back in a few hours.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.418
- Okay. Well, I might need it
for a few hours

01:26.453 --> 01:27.986
after that though.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.421
Fine, we'll just keep it

(All start booing)

08:31.611 --> 08:32.944
- Uh, was that for me?

08:32.979 --> 08:34.512
Why am I-why am I getting
booed?

08:34.547 --> 08:36.781
- That's... Wait!
That's my man, Johnny!

08:36.816 --> 08:39.651
Hey Johnny, it's Roland!

08:39.686 --> 08:41.753
Hey, we're all here at RAMC!

08:41.788 --> 08:43.955
You should be here,
Mary-something is here...

08:43.990 --> 08:46.357
Gavin is here...
The road salt guy...

08:46.392 --> 08:47.792
- Yeah. Okay, Roland.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.061
Good. I'm having a bit
of a night myself here.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.496
- Come on!

08:51.531 --> 08:52.697
- Stop, I have to talk
to my husband.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.165
John. John.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.768
- Moira, you know,
it might be time for a coffee.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.603
And I'm gonna let you go now.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.505
And have fun, sweetheart.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.706
We'll see you in the morning.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.374
- Goodbye, phone call!

09:03.409 --> 09:04.776
- Goodbye, my darling.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.144
- All right.
Goodnight, sweetheart.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.546
Oh, Moira, by the way,
I just picked up the new--

09:08.581 --> 09:10.014
(Phone hangs up)

09:10.049 --> 09:11.482
(Loud music and party chatter
and laughter)

09:11.517 --> 09:13.818
- (Dial tone) Okay.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.821
(Hangs up)

09:18.625 --> 09:20.058
(Birds chirp)

09:22.528 --> 09:24.429
- John, shut the blinds.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.701
Johnny, please.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.838
(Waking groans)

09:36.643 --> 09:38.876
- Moira?
- Hm?

09:40.546 --> 09:41.980
(Moira screams)

09:42.015 --> 09:45.083
Roland! What are you doing
in my room?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.786
- What are you talking about?
This is my room.

09:48.821 --> 09:51.990
- Well, what the fuck are you
doing in your room?

09:52.025 --> 09:53.591
Well, I was trying to sleep.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.660
Until you started pounding
on the door,

09:55.695 --> 09:58.463
telling me to whip up
a salmon plate.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.800
I finally let you in,
you flaked out on the bed.

10:02.835 --> 10:05.403
- Oh my God.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.840
Are you naked under there?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.876
- Honey, what I do in
the privacy of my sheets

10:11.911 --> 10:13.678
is my own business.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.380
- Oh, no. No God, no.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.950
Oh, God, no. No, dear God.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.119
- Welcome to RAMC.
(Laughs)

10:21.154 --> 10:23.888
- (Moira whimpers)
Oh, my God No!

10:26.693 --> 10:28.059
(Bell jungles over door)

10:28.094 --> 10:30.762
(Music plays quietly,
dishes clank)

10:30.797 --> 10:33.765
- Jocelyn!

10:33.800 --> 10:35.800
Almost didn't recognize
you over there.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.635
- Hey Johnny.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.003
It's been a morning,

10:39.038 --> 10:40.772
but I don't have to tell
you that.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.875
- Oh, I'm sorry.
You've had a tough morning?

10:43.910 --> 10:46.878
- You're handling this
way better than I am.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.946
- Handling what better?

10:50.783 --> 10:53.851
- Roland and Moira,
sleeping together.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.453
- (Laughs) What?!

10:55.488 --> 10:56.854
- At the conference last night.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.823
- Yeah. No, no!

10:58.858 --> 11:01.426
Let's just go back to that
previous sentence.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.929
Ah, when you say
they slept together...

11:04.964 --> 11:06.964
- Well, Roland says
that they just slept

11:06.999 --> 11:10.034
in the same bed together.
- Ah-ha.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.903
- And he says that nothing
happened,

11:11.938 --> 11:15.473
so I'm just trying to,
you know, process all of this.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.675
- Oh yes. Well...

11:17.710 --> 11:20.178
Aren't we all.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.280
I mean, I'm-I'm hearing
about this for the first time.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.915
- Moira didn't tell you?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.683
- You know, we chatted
this morning

11:25.718 --> 11:27.118
about how successful
the night was,

11:27.153 --> 11:28.553
but sleeping with your husband

11:28.588 --> 11:30.655
didn't really come up as one
of the reasons

11:30.690 --> 11:32.924
the night was so successful.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.792
- And we probably shouldn't
read anything

11:34.827 --> 11:36.127
into the fact that
for some reason,

11:36.162 --> 11:38.062
Moira decided to hide
this from you.

11:38.097 --> 11:41.265
- No-no, I wouldn't say "hide."
No, no.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.702
Because Moira was so exhausted
when she got in this morning.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.538
- Maybe she was exhausted
because she was up all night

11:47.573 --> 11:50.174
with her mitts all over--
- No! No. No! No.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.644
I know Moira and she would
never in a million years ever

11:53.679 --> 11:55.680
sleep with...

11:55.715 --> 11:57.081
Anyone. Else.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.450
- It's just that I know
what it's like

11:59.485 --> 12:03.688
to be in bed with a naked
Roland Schitt,

12:03.723 --> 12:05.890
and I am powerless against that.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.659
- He was naked?

12:08.694 --> 12:11.596
- He sleeps naked every night.

12:14.767 --> 12:18.302
Do you wanna order some thing
to put chocolate sauce on?

12:18.337 --> 12:19.937
- No.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.207
(Marker rasps)

12:24.844 --> 12:26.277
-Um, David, I can swing
by the store

12:26.312 --> 12:28.646
and help out after school,
if you want.

12:28.681 --> 12:32.083
I also may need more of that
lip balm that I liked.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.619
- Okay. Um, I think we've had
enough of your help.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.255
And unless you planning
on purchasing that lip balm

12:37.290 --> 12:38.990
you're won't be getting
the lip balm.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.692
- Okay. It's called sweat
equity, David.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.227
I learned about this week.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.929
And that's when you help
someone out

12:44.964 --> 12:46.264
and then they give you lip balm

12:46.299 --> 12:47.832
or whatever else you might need

12:47.867 --> 12:51.002
in exchange for your time
and energy.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.070
- I think you might actually
need to break a sweat,

12:53.105 --> 12:56.107
in order to earn sweat equity.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.911
- Okay, what if I got Patrick
to break a sweat for me.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.913
That's called outsourcing,
outsourcing--

13:01.948 --> 13:04.649
- Are you passing this
economics course?

13:04.684 --> 13:05.983
- Yes. Yeah.

13:06.018 --> 13:08.019
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.955
- Okay. Well, if you really
want the lip balm that bad

13:10.990 --> 13:12.824
there are a few things
around the store

13:12.859 --> 13:14.192
that I could use your help with.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.195
just an fyi,
Patrick won't be there.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.063
So there won't be anybody
for you

13:19.098 --> 13:20.998
to flirtatiously boss around.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.934
- Okay, I hate to break this
to you, David,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.802
but there will always be
somebody for me

13:24.837 --> 13:26.737
to flirtatiously boss around.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.940
So what was going on there?

13:28.975 --> 13:30.374
- Oh, nothing.

13:30.409 --> 13:31.809
He hasn't even asked
for my number,

13:31.844 --> 13:33.311
which in my experience,

13:33.346 --> 13:36.681
means he's either newly married
or he's gay.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.182
Okay...

13:38.217 --> 13:40.751
So like if you're sensing
a vibe or something,

13:40.786 --> 13:44.188
maybe that means that his eye
for somebody else...

13:46.158 --> 13:48.993
- He's a business major
who wears straight leg,

13:49.028 --> 13:50.761
mid-range denim.

13:50.796 --> 13:53.231
He's not into me.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.032
- Okay, well it's either that
or he's really into your store,

13:55.067 --> 13:57.368
which no offense seems a lot
less likely to me.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.669
- Okay.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.639
I think you misses a spot on
that page with the highlighter.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.374
- Where?

14:03.409 --> 14:05.376
(Beep pouring)

14:05.411 --> 14:07.378
(Door opens)

14:07.413 --> 14:10.081
- Hello, Moira.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.984
- Hello there, love of my life!

14:13.019 --> 14:16.053
- Funny thing.
I just ran into Jocelyn.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.956
- Oh. How is Jocelyn?

14:18.991 --> 14:22.093
- Oh, she was a little upset.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.762
Apparently her husband, Roland,

14:24.797 --> 14:27.131
spent the night with... you.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.635
- I know, wasn't that funny?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.103
- Moira!

14:32.138 --> 14:34.105
When were you gonna tell me
about this?

14:34.140 --> 14:36.073
- Ah, we talked about it
this morning, John!

14:36.108 --> 14:37.608
We laughed about it.

14:37.643 --> 14:38.976
- We didn't laugh about it.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.779
Because we didn't talk
about it.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.147
I would have remembered
if you had said

14:43.182 --> 14:45.082
something that funny.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.717
- It's inconsequential, John

14:46.752 --> 14:48.686
Just let it go. I have.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.089
- May I ask what you are doing?

14:52.124 --> 14:54.458
- Oh, I've decided to cut down
on my drinking.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.361
- Unrelated, I assume?

14:57.396 --> 14:58.629
- To what?

14:58.664 --> 15:01.098
- To you sleeping with Roland
last night.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.833
- Okay. This joke has played
itself out.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.201
It was humorous this morning.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.737
- We didn't talk about it
this morning!

15:06.772 --> 15:08.639
- Obviously.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.909
I didn't tell you anything
because I was embarrassed.

15:11.944 --> 15:13.444
I was riding high, John,

15:13.479 --> 15:15.179
apparently really high,

15:15.214 --> 15:18.316
After winning what some people
called a landmark victory

15:18.351 --> 15:20.751
for this and many other towns.

15:20.786 --> 15:25.790
Then I woke up in the last
place I ever wanted to be.

15:28.294 --> 15:31.228
- Well, Can't say I'm not glad
to hear you say that.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.800
- Oh John, I owe an apology
to you.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.103
And to sober people everywhere.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.941
- Well, I knew it was nothing
happened, Moira, it's...

15:43.976 --> 15:45.309
Just I was getting a feeling

15:45.344 --> 15:47.678
you weren't taking this
very seriously.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.881
- If I weren't, John,
would I be pouring this out.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.216
(Beer pouring)

15:52.251 --> 15:53.751
- Moira, that's my beer!

15:53.786 --> 15:55.052
You don't even drink beer!

15:55.087 --> 15:56.520
It's symbolic, John.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.461
(Door opens)
Traffic whirs)

16:06.499 --> 16:07.898
- Oh-oh.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.233
I take it you're here
to tell me

16:09.268 --> 16:11.802
that my business license
has been revoked.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.070
- No, no. You're all good.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.539
- Okay. Um...

16:15.574 --> 16:17.008
- My sister isn't,

16:17.043 --> 16:19.176
isn't here so...

16:19.211 --> 16:21.746
- I'm not here for your sister.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.648
- Okay.

16:24.683 --> 16:27.218
You know I've been thinking
about all this

16:27.253 --> 16:29.020
and these products that Alexis
was showing me yesterday

16:29.055 --> 16:31.222
were actually really
impressive,

16:31.257 --> 16:33.824
I mean the whole model
is actually very sustainable--

16:33.859 --> 16:35.259
- (Inhales) Thank you.

16:35.294 --> 16:38.963
- But I think you're gonna need
more start-up money.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.464
- Oh. More start-up money.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.066
- Hm.
- Um...

16:42.101 --> 16:44.769
And where do you think
I'll get that money?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.470
- Well, when you're supporting
local business,

16:46.505 --> 16:48.572
there are grants
that you can apply for.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.475
And I would be happy to assist
you with those applications.

16:53.112 --> 16:56.047
- Well, that is very um...
very generous.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.782
- Well, I wouldn't be doing it
for free.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.785
See, if these grants came
through,

17:00.820 --> 17:03.354
you'd have the money
to start paying me.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.655
- Okay.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.558
- Um, I really think you have
something here, David.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.995
You just, you just need help.
You need a lot of help--

17:11.030 --> 17:13.330
- Okay. Um...

17:13.365 --> 17:15.166
Well, uh, then yes...

17:16.402 --> 17:19.036
I am open to entertaining

17:19.071 --> 17:20.805
your investment offer.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.543
- Great.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.279
And in the interest of us
potentially working together

17:28.314 --> 17:32.349
I did want to come clean
about something.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.453
- Okay.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.390
- I um...

17:39.425 --> 17:42.460
I actually picked out
that frame.

17:45.131 --> 17:48.065
- I see.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.433
So thank you for making it
very clear

17:49.468 --> 17:52.203
that I will be making
the creative decisions

17:52.238 --> 17:54.705
for the store.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.241
Um, and I guess you can handle
all the business stuff.

17:57.276 --> 17:58.943
- I'm very comfortable
with that.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.444
- Okay.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.380
Um, and you do know that
if the grant money

18:03.415 --> 18:05.015
doesn't come through,
then I won't---

18:05.050 --> 18:06.884
- Oh, I'm gonna get the money.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.621
- Okay.

18:10.656 --> 18:11.922
(Crickets chirp)

18:11.957 --> 18:13.390
(Knocking)

18:19.398 --> 18:22.466
- Hello, Johnny.
- Roland.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.302
- Johnny, me and six of my
closest friends

18:25.337 --> 18:28.372
were hoping we could
have a little chat.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.307
- Well, it's awfully late.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.876
- Johnny, I'm talking
about the beer.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.777
- No, I know, I know, you're
talking about the beer.

18:33.812 --> 18:35.980
it's just that Moira's
in the shower.

18:36.015 --> 18:39.150
She's been showering most
of the day, actually.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.651
- Good,

18:40.686 --> 18:43.354
because I think it's best
that we talk man-to-man.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.890
(Beer pops open)
Ahh...

18:45.925 --> 18:48.325
(Slurping)

18:48.360 --> 18:50.394
Jocelyn and I spoke,

18:50.429 --> 18:53.597
and she told me you're still
pretty upset, huh?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.200
- Look, if anyone was upset
it was Jocelyn.

18:56.235 --> 18:59.036
I was just upset because
Jocelyn was upset.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.471
- All right, pal.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.606
Well, I'm here to put your mind
at ease, okay?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.608
I am 99.999% sure

19:08.047 --> 19:10.247
that nothing happened
between me and your wife.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.917
- I'm 100% sure
and I wasn't even there!

19:12.952 --> 19:14.218
- Well, I sure was.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.120
(Laughing)

19:16.155 --> 19:18.322
All of me.

19:18.357 --> 19:22.293
You know, I spent 35 minutes
this morning

19:22.328 --> 19:25.529
inspecting every inch
of my body for bite marks,

19:25.564 --> 19:27.531
back scratches,
lipstick prints.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.533
And I couldn't find anything.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.569
Well, there was this one thing
on the bottom of my foot,

19:31.604 --> 19:33.137
but I think that may have
been there before.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.471
I really don't know.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.873
- You know what, Roland,

19:35.908 --> 19:37.441
I think I'm gonna ask you
to leave.

19:37.476 --> 19:38.842
Because Moira's coming out
soon and I really don't--

19:38.877 --> 19:41.512
- ...want to tempt fate twice.
I got it.

19:41.547 --> 19:44.381
- No, no. I don't think
you do got it.

19:44.416 --> 19:47.184
And not to put too fine
a point on it, Roland,

19:47.219 --> 19:49.320
but my wife would never
go out for a burger

19:49.355 --> 19:52.990
when she has a strong penchant
for steak.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.692
Good night, Roland.
- Breakfast tomorrow, right?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.093
- Good night, Roland.
- Okay.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.465
- Don't worry it's only me.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.401
- Ha ha, very droll, Mr. Rose.

20:04.436 --> 20:05.903
- Thought I'd announce myself

20:05.938 --> 20:08.572
just in case you were expecting
somebody else.

20:08.607 --> 20:11.041
- Is living with that blackout
not punishment enough?

20:11.076 --> 20:13.410
- (Chuckles) You know I meant
to ask, Moira,

20:13.445 --> 20:15.713
what were the amenities like
in that hotel room?

20:15.748 --> 20:18.415
High-pressured water,
down pillows?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.452
- I'll never know.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.654
I had my one chance
at a proletarian oasis

20:23.689 --> 20:25.656
and I squandered it,
passed out Roland a bed.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.427
- You slept with Roland?

20:30.462 --> 20:32.363
- No, she-she didn't.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.466
She found herself in his bed.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.303
- Mom slept with Roland?
- Yes. Apparently.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.305
- I will not be tried
and condemned

20:41.340 --> 20:42.773
by the likes of you two.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.541
- So what's gonna happen now?
- Yeah.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.877
- Is there gonna be like
a custody battle over us?

20:46.912 --> 20:48.279
- David, stop.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.546
- We gonna have to like
spend weekends

20:49.581 --> 20:51.482
over at Roland's now, or?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.050
- Goodnight, Alexis.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.585
- Do we call him uncle Roland?

20:54.620 --> 20:56.253
- All right, that is enough,
David.

20:56.288 --> 20:57.755
- No. I mean, I get it,
Roland is the mayor,

20:57.790 --> 20:59.256
and it's very difficult
to work with someone

20:59.291 --> 21:00.624
who you're attracted to.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.126
- Yeah. Like you and Ted?

21:02.161 --> 21:04.395
- No! I'm making fun of mom
and dad right now, David.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.463
- And we're done.
Back to your rooms.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.199
Um, I just want you to know

21:09.234 --> 21:11.535
that no matter what anyone says,

21:11.570 --> 21:13.304
you will always be
our first dad.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.705
Good night.
- Okay.
