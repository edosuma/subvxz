00:08.138 --> 00:09.605
Woman: Customer service. May I help you?

00:09.640 --> 00:11.707
Yes. I'm here. Alan Masters.

00:11.742 --> 00:15.444
It's account number 34697721.

00:15.479 --> 00:17.813
You guys recently added
the Adventure Channel,

00:17.848 --> 00:19.014
and I paid to get it,

00:19.049 --> 00:21.717
- but my screen is all wavy, so...
- Wrong department, sir.

00:21.752 --> 00:23.185
No, what do you mean, wrong department?

00:23.220 --> 00:24.320
- I pressed 3.
- Please hold.

00:24.355 --> 00:27.322
Don't you put me on hold.
I've been on hold for 45 min...

Woman:
<i>Your call is very important to us.</i>

00:44.341 --> 00:47.208
<i>- Please continue holding.</i>
- Hello, hello, hello, hello!

00:47.243 --> 00:50.177
[Hold music resumes]

00:58.722 --> 01:00.154
Sorry about that, sir.

01:00.189 --> 01:03.157
I can connect you to the
correct department now.

01:03.192 --> 01:04.590
Sir?

01:04.626 --> 01:07.094
Are you okay? Hello?

01:07.129 --> 01:08.229
[Thud]

01:14.737 --> 01:16.102
What are you doing?

01:16.137 --> 01:17.838
Watching you sleep.

01:17.873 --> 01:19.172
Is that creepy?

01:19.207 --> 01:21.207
Mnh-mnh. I think it's sweet.

01:21.243 --> 01:23.009
I took some pictures.

01:23.044 --> 01:24.578
Less sweet.

01:24.613 --> 01:26.780
They're part of a series.
Usually you don't wake up.

01:26.815 --> 01:28.214
And now it's creepy.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.183
Hey. I've been thinking...

01:30.218 --> 01:31.017
Oh, no.

01:31.052 --> 01:31.885
Oh, relax.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.786
I'm over that whole sex-in-zero-g thing.

01:33.821 --> 01:36.256
Good, 'cause that was just an
accident waiting to happen.

01:36.291 --> 01:37.156
Seriously, though.

01:37.192 --> 01:39.125
I think it's time we shake things up.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.094
Move to Paris, you know,

01:41.129 --> 01:43.296
search for buried treasure in Nepal.

01:43.331 --> 01:46.032
We could fly a hot air
balloon across the Sahara.

01:46.067 --> 01:48.234
You know what?
I love all of those ideas,

01:48.270 --> 01:51.570
but I just became captain,
and you have your P.I. business.

01:51.606 --> 01:53.138
And then there's LokSat.

01:53.173 --> 01:54.874
Exactly. [Cellphone rings]

01:54.909 --> 01:56.475
We have responsibilities, right?

01:56.511 --> 02:00.279
But what if we didn't?

02:00.314 --> 02:01.280
Hold, please.

02:01.315 --> 02:03.315
Um, I might need that.
That might be a homicide.

02:03.350 --> 02:05.317
The victim's not gonna get any deader.

02:05.352 --> 02:06.285
Listen.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.586
Let's say we find LokSat
and take him down...

02:09.622 --> 02:10.655
Without getting killed.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.656
Mm-hmm.

02:11.691 --> 02:12.925
What then?

02:12.960 --> 02:15.660
You're not gonna be captain of
the 12th Precinct for very long.

02:15.695 --> 02:18.163
You're on a rocket. Sky's the limit.

02:18.198 --> 02:20.498
So you know what happens then?

02:20.534 --> 02:21.599
Mnh-mnh.

02:21.635 --> 02:23.768
We become normal.

02:23.804 --> 02:27.138
No, Castle,
you're never gonna be normal.

02:27.173 --> 02:28.406
I'm serious.

02:29.736 --> 02:31.743
- Think about it.
- I will.

02:33.713 --> 02:34.813
What do you got?

02:34.848 --> 02:36.147
Lanie: Alan Masters.

02:36.182 --> 02:37.949
All signs point to poison...

02:37.984 --> 02:41.085
Dilated pupils,
bluish discoloration around the lips.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.286
That's a giveaway,

02:42.322 --> 02:43.921
but I'll know for sure
after the autopsy.

02:43.957 --> 02:44.922
Who called it in?

02:44.958 --> 02:45.957
Customer-service operator
for his cable company.

02:45.992 --> 02:48.326
She was on the phone with
him when it happened.

02:48.361 --> 02:49.927
What a way to go.

02:49.963 --> 02:51.996
Poisoned or on the phone
with the cable company?

02:52.031 --> 02:53.764
Well, at least the poison was quick.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.866
Looks like our killer
jimmied that window open.

02:55.901 --> 02:58.335
Neighbor thought she heard
somebody on the fire escape

02:58.370 --> 02:59.369
last night around 8:00.

02:59.404 --> 03:00.838
How was he poisoned?

03:00.873 --> 03:01.705
In his water.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.173
The filter underneath the kitchen sink

03:03.208 --> 03:04.374
was tampered with.

03:04.409 --> 03:06.844
Ironically, he works for the
city as a safety inspector.

03:06.879 --> 03:08.011
Mm.

03:08.046 --> 03:12.148
You know, if I were an expert
on character, which I am,

03:12.184 --> 03:15.285
I would say that Alan
was a bit of a dreamer,

03:15.320 --> 03:18.188
spending his days on the
ground inspecting things

03:18.223 --> 03:19.889
but his nights in the clouds,

03:19.924 --> 03:21.824
fantasizing of adventure.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.560
Tragically, his life was cut short

03:24.596 --> 03:26.696
before he ever truly lived.

03:26.731 --> 03:27.563
Man: Hey.

03:27.599 --> 03:30.399
What's going on?

03:30.434 --> 03:31.667
[Clipboard clatters]

03:31.703 --> 03:32.535
Or not.

03:32.570 --> 03:34.670
What are you all doing in my apartment?

03:34.706 --> 03:36.372
Um, Lanie.

03:36.407 --> 03:39.475
Don't "Um, Lanie" me. That man was dead!

03:39.511 --> 03:41.744
Well, he's very much alive now.

03:41.779 --> 03:44.213
He had no pulse, no breath sounds,

03:44.248 --> 03:46.415
and his pupils were dilated and fixed.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.350
Was there rigor mortis, lividity?

03:48.386 --> 03:50.486
No,
but he'd been dead less than an hour.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.354
Lanie, hey.
Is it true that our victim was...

03:52.390 --> 03:54.689
He was dead, okay?
I know how to do my job.

03:54.725 --> 03:57.192
Okay, calm down.
It's all good. I just...

03:57.228 --> 03:59.028
No, no, no. It's not all good.

03:59.063 --> 04:01.262
I almost stuck a
thermometer in his liver.

04:01.297 --> 04:02.931
Uh, so is he stable?

04:02.966 --> 04:04.666
Well, I'm still running tests,

04:04.701 --> 04:06.401
but he seems completely healthy

04:06.436 --> 04:09.237
despite having ingested a
deadly dose of tetrodotoxin.

04:09.272 --> 04:10.271
Hm?

04:10.306 --> 04:11.406
TTX.

04:11.441 --> 04:13.608
It's a neurotoxin found in
several species of fish.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.076
It's extremely potent.

04:15.111 --> 04:18.779
And yet he survived,
so do you have an explanation.

04:18.814 --> 04:21.449
No, but your husband sure does.

04:21.483 --> 04:22.616
You are a modern-day Lazarus,

04:22.652 --> 04:25.686
risen from the grave to
answer the eternal question...

04:25.721 --> 04:28.189
What's on the other side?

04:28.224 --> 04:30.358
I'm sorry. Who are you again?

04:30.393 --> 04:32.527
You'll have to forgive him, Mr. Masters.

04:32.562 --> 04:33.594
He's very excitable.

04:33.629 --> 04:35.696
Well, excuse me if I find
pulling back the curtain

04:35.731 --> 04:37.998
on what happens when we
die just a tad exciting.

04:38.034 --> 04:40.834
Was there a white light or
is it more of a tunnel thing?

04:40.870 --> 04:42.369
The last thing I remember,

04:42.404 --> 04:45.180
I was taking my pills,
trying to get my cable fixed,

04:45.307 --> 04:47.975
and then I woke up to an
apartment full of police.

04:48.010 --> 04:50.277
So, no out-of-body experience?

04:50.312 --> 04:51.811
Do you have any enemies?

04:51.847 --> 04:53.580
Me? No. I'm an average guy.

04:53.615 --> 04:55.249
I go to work, I come home.

04:55.284 --> 04:57.851
But you dream of so much more,
don't you?

04:57.887 --> 04:59.987
How do you know that?

05:00.022 --> 05:02.322
Did you read my diary?

05:02.358 --> 05:03.823
No, I saw your pictures on your...

05:03.859 --> 05:05.259
Wait, you keep a diary?

05:05.294 --> 05:07.660
As a grown man, call it a journal.

05:07.696 --> 05:08.528
What about work?

05:08.563 --> 05:10.830
Have you upset anyone there recently?

05:10.866 --> 05:11.731
Yeah.

05:11.767 --> 05:13.533
There is this guy that works for me...

05:13.568 --> 05:16.102
Well, used to work for me...
Dave Barton.

05:16.137 --> 05:18.337
I had to fire him because he was letting

05:18.373 --> 05:21.173
serious infractions slide
with just a warning.

05:21.209 --> 05:22.275
Was it for money?

05:22.310 --> 05:23.342
That was the rumor.

05:23.378 --> 05:26.946
And he did seem a little
miffed when I let him go.

05:26.981 --> 05:29.648
I'll play you the
message that he left me.

05:29.683 --> 05:32.018
Dave: <i>You slimy little maggot.</i>

05:32.053 --> 05:34.720
<i>I'm gonna stab you with a rusty spoon</i>

05:34.755 --> 05:36.622
<i>and strangle you with
your own intestines.</i>

05:36.657 --> 05:37.723
<i>Or better yet,</i>

05:37.758 --> 05:39.358
<i>I'm gonna force-feed you
your toes one by one,</i>

05:39.394 --> 05:41.293
<i>and then I'm gonna light you on fire.</i>

05:41.328 --> 05:43.462
<i>First, I'm gonna paralyze
you with a claw hammer</i>

05:43.497 --> 05:45.898
<i>and then cover you with ants,
you son of a bitch!</i>

05:45.933 --> 05:47.900
And it goes on and on
like that for a while.

05:47.935 --> 05:49.468
And you never thought
to call the police?

05:49.503 --> 05:51.372
On Dave? No!

05:51.784 --> 05:54.306
He's just got a big personality.

05:54.341 --> 05:57.575
What can I say? I have anger issues.

05:57.610 --> 06:00.178
And a gift for murderous creativity.

06:00.213 --> 06:03.415
Threatening to
"nail Alan to the ceiling by his feet

06:03.450 --> 06:07.018
and piÃ±ata the hell out of
his face with a Fungo bat."

06:07.054 --> 06:09.066
It's all just talk.

06:09.198 --> 06:11.423
I actually get nauseous
at the sight of blood.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.258
Oh, is that why you decided
to poison Alan last night?

06:14.293 --> 06:15.893
Hey, I was home last night

06:15.929 --> 06:17.995
with my wife and my mother-in-law,

06:18.030 --> 06:20.397
which, believe you me,
is no good for my anger issues.

06:20.433 --> 06:22.232
I mean, that woman drives me crazy.

06:22.268 --> 06:23.868
Sometimes I just think about getting

06:23.903 --> 06:25.369
a blender and a trowel and...

06:27.907 --> 06:29.273
Kidding.

06:29.308 --> 06:31.208
Well,
you better hope your alibi holds up,

06:31.243 --> 06:32.909
'cause you had all the
motive in the world.

06:32.945 --> 06:34.011
You want motive?

06:34.046 --> 06:35.279
We're safety inspectors.

06:35.314 --> 06:37.247
You think we're making friends

06:37.283 --> 06:39.450
handing out millions in fines?

06:39.485 --> 06:41.051
We're not getting any Christmas cards.

06:41.087 --> 06:42.786
Especially Alan.

06:42.821 --> 06:44.288
What do you mean, especially Alan?

06:44.323 --> 06:46.623
The guy's got a rep for
being a real stickler.

06:46.658 --> 06:47.724
He doesn't let anything slide.

06:47.759 --> 06:49.092
Oh, is that what you did...

06:49.127 --> 06:51.227
Let things slide in
exchange for a payday?

06:51.262 --> 06:53.396
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

06:53.431 --> 06:54.965
Doesn't make me a killer.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.201
The point is that Alan
refuses to play the game.

06:58.236 --> 07:00.637
And that pisses off a lot of people.

07:01.809 --> 07:02.605
Hey.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.374
Did Lanie really
declare a live guy dead?

07:04.409 --> 07:05.441
No.

07:05.477 --> 07:06.476
Well, yeah,

07:06.511 --> 07:08.311
But do yourself a favor...
Don't mention it to her.

07:08.346 --> 07:09.745
So, you got something?

07:09.780 --> 07:11.481
I might have broken open LokSat.

07:11.516 --> 07:12.482
You found them?

07:12.517 --> 07:15.218
Unfortunately, no,
but I did find someone else.

07:15.253 --> 07:17.820
Based on Castle's discovery
of the exact time and date

07:17.855 --> 07:19.054
LokSat flew into L.A.,

07:19.089 --> 07:20.489
I've been scrubbing footage

07:20.525 --> 07:22.324
from all the Los Angeles area airports.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.092
Look who showed up.

07:25.383 --> 07:26.595
Caleb Brown?

07:26.631 --> 07:29.732
But he was traveling under an alias...
Peter McCaffery.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.267
So, Caleb must have gone to
L.A. to meet with LokSat.

07:32.302 --> 07:33.602
But who's driving the S.U.V.?

07:33.638 --> 07:34.436
I don't know.

07:34.471 --> 07:36.004
I can only read part of the plate,

07:36.040 --> 07:38.173
but I'm generating a
list of possible matches.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.841
Captain. [Knocks]

07:39.876 --> 07:41.609
Dave Barton alibied out,

07:41.645 --> 07:43.611
but we're getting a list
of all the companies

07:43.647 --> 07:45.480
that Alan has either fined or shut down

07:45.516 --> 07:46.415
for violations recently.

07:46.450 --> 07:48.150
Then we're gonna run the list past Alan.

07:48.185 --> 07:49.617
Whose would-be killer
is still out there,

07:49.653 --> 07:51.086
so what precautions are you taking?

07:51.121 --> 07:52.536
Squad car just brought him
home from the hospital.

07:52.619 --> 07:54.155
We got a uniform posted
outside his door,

07:54.190 --> 07:58.326
which makes his only real
concern your husband.

07:58.362 --> 07:59.927
Yeah.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.896
So, you have died and been reborn.

08:01.931 --> 08:03.297
What are you gonna do now?

08:03.333 --> 08:04.232
Going to bed.

08:04.267 --> 08:06.401
I have a full day of
inspections tomorrow.

08:06.436 --> 08:07.469
I need to be focused.

08:07.504 --> 08:09.837
You can't just go back to
work like nothing happened.

08:09.873 --> 08:12.139
You had a near-death experience.
That's a wake-up call.

08:12.175 --> 08:13.040
Get out there.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.009
Live this life you've
always dreamed about.

08:15.044 --> 08:17.245
Just because I have a
few pictures on my wall

08:17.280 --> 08:19.180
doesn't mean I'm not happy with my life.

08:19.215 --> 08:21.349
Right. Your drab, solitary life.

08:21.384 --> 08:23.484
It's not solitary.

08:23.519 --> 08:25.318
So there's a Ms. Safety Inspector?

08:26.584 --> 08:27.921
Not exactly.

08:27.956 --> 08:30.357
But there is a woman I have my eye on.

08:30.393 --> 08:31.958
She's funny and smart.

08:31.994 --> 08:33.360
Doesn't know you exist?

08:33.395 --> 08:34.159
No.

08:34.196 --> 08:35.160
Man: All clear.

08:35.197 --> 08:37.330
I'll be right outside
if you need anything.

08:37.366 --> 08:38.164
Great, thanks.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.166
You should really call this woman.

08:40.202 --> 08:41.333
Okay, I will.

08:41.370 --> 08:43.669
And you honestly don't remember
anything about being dead?

08:43.705 --> 08:45.138
Really don't.

08:53.382 --> 08:54.147
Who does that?

08:54.182 --> 08:55.648
Who gets a second chance like that

08:55.683 --> 08:56.707
and just goes to work the next morning?

08:56.723 --> 08:58.484
I would. I like work.

09:01.222 --> 09:02.321
[Electricity surges]

09:02.356 --> 09:04.156
[Clattering]

09:05.493 --> 09:07.226
Whoa!

09:07.261 --> 09:08.861
Alan!

09:16.814 --> 09:19.504
Someone rigged the bed
to electrocute him.

09:20.112 --> 09:21.679
Is he dead?

09:25.571 --> 09:30.249
Sorry, Castle, but this time,
he really is dead.

09:30.284 --> 09:31.483
What a waste.

09:31.518 --> 09:33.184
To be given a second chance

09:33.219 --> 09:34.986
and have it taken away like this.

09:35.021 --> 09:37.088
He was just gonna go back to
work like nothing happened.

09:37.123 --> 09:38.089
What?

09:38.124 --> 09:40.759
If I hadn't been so
focused on his rebirth,

09:40.794 --> 09:42.727
I might have noticed that wire.

09:42.763 --> 09:44.195
I could have saved him.

09:44.230 --> 09:46.164
You can't beat yourself up, Castle.

09:46.199 --> 09:49.267
I was starting to think he was
some kind of medical miracle.

09:49.302 --> 09:50.901
Turns out, he was just lucky.

09:50.937 --> 09:52.770
And in the end, his luck ran out.

09:52.805 --> 09:54.672
[Coughing]

09:56.409 --> 09:57.575
[Grunts]

09:57.610 --> 09:58.676
[Sighs]

10:01.814 --> 10:03.848
Forget lucky.

10:03.883 --> 10:05.415
Somebody cooking barbecue?

10:05.451 --> 10:07.317
[Sniffs]

10:08.588 --> 10:09.587
He's immortal.

10:09.622 --> 10:12.389
S08E19
Dead Again

10:12.417 --> 10:15.386
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

10:16.363 --> 10:19.327
- He was definitely dead.
- That's what you said last time.

10:19.598 --> 10:21.832
He was dead the last time, too.

10:21.867 --> 10:22.999
Uh, sorry.

10:23.035 --> 10:24.535
Um, can we have a minute, please?

10:24.570 --> 10:25.536
- Of course.
- Thanks.

10:25.571 --> 10:27.170
I'm sorry. I'm just rattled.

10:27.206 --> 10:29.739
You know,
people can come back from being poisoned

10:29.774 --> 10:32.741
and from being electrocuted,
but both in the same day?

10:32.844 --> 10:34.644
So, is there an explanation?

10:34.679 --> 10:35.778
I can think of two.

10:35.813 --> 10:37.247
Either I'm really bad at my job

10:37.282 --> 10:39.315
or Castle's right and
this guy is immortal.

10:39.351 --> 10:40.383
He is not immortal,

10:40.419 --> 10:42.085
and you are a genius at your job.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.220
We just got to keep looking for answers,

10:44.256 --> 10:46.822
starting with who wants
to kill this guy so badly.

10:46.858 --> 10:48.624
Is there any forensics
on the second attempt?

10:48.660 --> 10:50.325
No. The bed must have been wired

10:50.361 --> 10:52.828
after the apartment was already released

10:52.864 --> 10:53.863
from being a crime scene,

10:53.898 --> 10:57.066
which means the killer had
about a two-hour window

10:57.101 --> 10:59.134
before Alan and Castle got there.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.570
Hey.

11:00.605 --> 11:03.439
So, the toxin that should
have killed Alan, TTX,

11:03.474 --> 11:04.540
is a controlled substance,

11:04.575 --> 11:07.276
available through only a
few pharma supply companies.

11:07.311 --> 11:09.445
CDC is sending us over a list right.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.013
So, finding the buyer
might lead to the killer.

11:12.049 --> 11:15.817
Any idea how our boy
Alan is still with us?

11:15.852 --> 11:18.853
Uh, no. But Castle has a theory.

11:18.889 --> 11:21.489
You are a superhero.

11:21.524 --> 11:24.192
No, I'm really not.
I'm just an ordinary guy.

11:24.227 --> 11:26.260
You <i> were</i> an ordinary guy, Alan.

11:26.296 --> 11:28.863
That's how most superheroes start out...

11:28.899 --> 11:31.265
Mild-mannered weaklings, and that's you!

11:31.301 --> 11:32.701
Wow, thanks.

11:32.736 --> 11:33.668
Relax.

11:33.704 --> 11:36.604
It's all to maximize
your transformative arc.

11:36.639 --> 11:39.673
If I agree with you,
will you leave me alone?

11:39.709 --> 11:42.610
Don't be silly.
We're just getting started!

11:42.645 --> 11:44.011
First, we need to figure out

11:44.046 --> 11:45.779
what triggered your transformation,

11:45.815 --> 11:47.615
your origin story, if you will.

11:47.650 --> 11:48.483
Why?

11:48.518 --> 11:50.451
Because the origin story is everything!

11:50.487 --> 11:52.853
What, there's, what,
nine Spider-Man movies about it?

11:52.888 --> 11:53.854
Yo.

11:53.889 --> 11:54.922
We got a lead.

11:54.957 --> 11:57.557
We need to come up with a
superhero name for Alan.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.159
No. No, we really don't.

11:59.194 --> 12:01.199
How about... Safety Man?

12:01.831 --> 12:03.330
No, that's terrible.

12:03.365 --> 12:04.698
Well, does he have any other powers?

12:04.734 --> 12:06.700
I don't know.
We should really run some tests.

12:06.736 --> 12:07.934
Um, you said something about a lead...

12:07.969 --> 12:10.837
Right. Yeah, we've been checking
into your inspection history

12:10.872 --> 12:12.872
to see if there's somebody
you might have pissed off.

12:12.907 --> 12:14.741
I think we have a winner...
Zantium Labs.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.876
You just hit them with
a six-figure fine.

12:16.911 --> 12:18.811
Yeah,
they're a biopharmaceutical company.

12:18.847 --> 12:20.547
I threatened to shut them down

12:20.582 --> 12:23.183
after they had a bad
chemical spill two days ago.

12:23.218 --> 12:24.751
Whoa. A chemical spill?

12:24.786 --> 12:25.818
Mystery solved.

12:25.854 --> 12:28.855
Exposure to dangerous
materials is the most common

12:28.890 --> 12:30.757
superhero origin story there is.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.525
Sorry. The spill was L.A.H.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.761
It's an inorganic compound
used as a catalyst

12:34.796 --> 12:36.863
to make other chemicals, which...

12:36.898 --> 12:38.731
The point is, it can be explosive,

12:38.767 --> 12:41.600
but there's nothing about it
that would ever turn anyone

12:41.636 --> 12:42.901
into a, I don't know...

12:42.936 --> 12:44.170
Captain Cool?

12:44.205 --> 12:46.772
No. But keep trying.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.840
Hey, who's on the hook for that spill?

12:48.876 --> 12:50.776
The lab manager, Frank Patchett.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.678
He begged me not to fine him.

12:52.713 --> 12:54.880
He said the lab was hemorrhaging money.

12:54.915 --> 12:55.847
That sounds like motive.

12:55.883 --> 12:57.182
Come on, Castle.
Let's go talk to this guy.

12:57.217 --> 12:58.950
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.552
Maybe I should come with you.

13:00.587 --> 13:01.920
Why?

13:01.955 --> 13:03.254
No reason.

13:04.992 --> 13:05.757
The girl.

13:05.793 --> 13:07.859
The one who doesn't know you exist.

13:07.895 --> 13:09.227
She works there, doesn't she?

13:09.262 --> 13:10.062
No.

13:11.098 --> 13:11.963
Yes.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.731
Her name is Gwen. She's in marketing.

13:13.766 --> 13:15.433
Sorry, Alan. You got to stay here.

13:15.468 --> 13:17.935
If there's someone at Zantium
Labs trying to kill you,

13:17.970 --> 13:20.538
I'd be the worst cop on the
force if I took you there.

13:20.574 --> 13:21.606
Don't worry, Alan.

13:21.641 --> 13:23.374
I'll put in a good for you with Gwen!

13:23.410 --> 13:25.810
No, no! Please... Please don't!

13:25.845 --> 13:28.913
I can't believe someone would
try and do that to poor Alan.

13:28.948 --> 13:30.280
He's such a sweet man.

13:30.316 --> 13:32.249
- So you do know him?
- Of course.

13:32.284 --> 13:34.218
People around here kind of hate him,

13:34.253 --> 13:36.620
but, I don't know,
I think he's really funny.

13:36.655 --> 13:38.388
Oh, I'll tell him you said that.

13:38.424 --> 13:39.824
Oh, that's Frank. Hey, Frank.

13:39.859 --> 13:41.491
Thank you.

13:41.527 --> 13:43.627
Mr. Patchett. I'm Detective Esposito.

13:43.662 --> 13:46.430
I need to ask you a few
questions about Alan Masters.

13:46.465 --> 13:47.264
Is he doing okay?

13:47.299 --> 13:48.932
I heard someone tried to kill him.

13:48.967 --> 13:49.833
Twice.

13:49.868 --> 13:51.167
How's the cleanup going?

13:51.203 --> 13:52.969
Oh, well, we're almost done here.

13:53.004 --> 13:55.305
Accidents happen.
Luckily, nobody was hurt.

13:55.341 --> 13:57.274
Nobody except Alan.

13:57.309 --> 14:00.009
You think what happened to
him is connected to the spill?

14:00.045 --> 14:01.211
Maybe.

14:01.247 --> 14:03.279
So why don't you get changed,
and we can go talk about it.

14:03.314 --> 14:04.914
Okay. Locker room's over there.

14:04.950 --> 14:05.882
We'll go with you.

14:05.917 --> 14:07.951
Actually,
I'm gonna go take a look around.

14:07.986 --> 14:09.619
Origin story.

14:21.299 --> 14:23.766
[Chuckles] Oh, wow!

14:23.801 --> 14:24.800
Hey.

14:24.835 --> 14:25.901
[Chuckles]

14:27.004 --> 14:28.137
Oh.

14:36.881 --> 14:38.013
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

14:38.048 --> 14:38.981
Can I help you with something?

14:39.016 --> 14:41.549
Yes, as a matter of fact,
you can, uh, Mike.

14:41.585 --> 14:43.118
Look, um, if you had to pick

14:43.154 --> 14:44.052
something in this lab

14:44.088 --> 14:46.521
that would turn somebody
into a superhero,

14:46.556 --> 14:47.489
what would it be?

14:47.524 --> 14:48.891
I'm... I'm sorry. What?

14:48.926 --> 14:50.959
Radioactive spider,
secret alien technology,

14:50.995 --> 14:52.263
super-soldier serum...

14:52.362 --> 14:53.615
Yeah,
we don't have anything like that here.

14:53.697 --> 14:55.129
Then what is... What about this?

14:55.165 --> 14:56.998
What are you working on right here?

14:57.033 --> 14:58.633
We've discovered an accelerated method

14:58.669 --> 15:00.168
for growing hair cells in the mice.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.304
Accelerated cell regeneration?

15:02.339 --> 15:05.072
That could be the key to immortality.

15:05.108 --> 15:07.141
Frank:
I've been supervising this cleanup

15:07.177 --> 15:08.242
for the last 48 hours.

15:08.278 --> 15:09.977
Even if I wanted to kill Alan,

15:10.013 --> 15:11.913
I didn't have the
opportunity or the energy.

15:11.948 --> 15:13.547
But you did have the motive.

15:13.582 --> 15:15.917
You begged him not to fine you,
and he did anyway.

15:15.952 --> 15:17.051
Yeah.

15:17.086 --> 15:19.153
He's a pain in the ass,
but the damage was already done.

15:19.189 --> 15:21.422
Killing him would have
accomplished nothing.

15:21.457 --> 15:22.890
You know, something odd did happen

15:22.926 --> 15:24.892
when I walked him out
to the parking lot.

15:24.928 --> 15:25.826
Odd how?

15:25.861 --> 15:26.694
There was someone hanging
out at Alan's car,

15:26.729 --> 15:28.995
but he took off when he saw us coming.

15:29.031 --> 15:30.931
I didn't think much of it at the time,
but...

15:30.966 --> 15:32.833
Does your parking lot
have security cameras?

15:32.868 --> 15:33.767
- Yeah.
- Let me see him.

15:33.803 --> 15:36.236
Mr. Hume,
so you're an operations manager

15:36.271 --> 15:39.005
at a plastics factory that
Alan recently shut down.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.006
Is that correct?

15:40.042 --> 15:42.108
I didn't do anything to Alan.
I'm innocent.

15:42.144 --> 15:44.510
Innocent men don't usually stalk
their victims in parking lots.

15:44.546 --> 15:48.081
I just wanted to talk to Alan.
That's all.

15:48.116 --> 15:50.283
I needed to find the right moment.

15:50.319 --> 15:51.684
We had to be alone.

15:51.720 --> 15:52.552
Okay.

15:52.587 --> 15:54.257
What did you want to talk to him about?

15:55.131 --> 15:57.057
Mr. Hume, if all you wanted to do

15:57.092 --> 15:59.592
was talk to him,
then why did UNis find you

15:59.627 --> 16:01.927
with two suitcases and
a ticket to Mexico?

16:01.963 --> 16:04.230
Because I don't want to die.

16:04.265 --> 16:06.098
They came after Alan and I'm next.

16:06.968 --> 16:09.535
Who's "they"?

16:09.571 --> 16:12.538
If you know who went after Alan,
you need to tell us.

16:12.574 --> 16:14.039
Was it someone from your company?

16:14.075 --> 16:15.640
Are you a whistle-blower, Glen?

16:15.676 --> 16:17.609
Is there something
you're trying to expose?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.378
Is that why you wanted to talk to Alan?

16:19.413 --> 16:20.946
The NYPD can protect you,

16:20.982 --> 16:23.082
and if someone really
is trying to kill you,

16:23.117 --> 16:25.150
you're a lot safer in here with us

16:25.186 --> 16:26.651
than out there, on your own.

16:26.687 --> 16:27.486
Okay.

16:27.521 --> 16:30.389
But it's not someone from my company.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.357
It's the mob.

16:33.528 --> 16:36.428
What would organized
crime want with Alan?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.398
Waste management.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.465
Yeah.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.634
They strong-armed me into
giving them the contract

16:42.669 --> 16:45.136
for my factory's
hazardous-waste disposal.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.739
They've been doing the
same thing all over town.

16:47.775 --> 16:50.241
And they just dump the
stuff into the landfill.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.743
So,
why would they target Alan before you?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.578
Because Alan fired Dave Barton,

16:54.614 --> 16:56.847
the only inspector that they could buy.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.816
So Alan was becoming a big problem,

16:58.851 --> 17:01.286
and their only solution was to kill him.

17:01.953 --> 17:04.205
The mob is trying to kill me?

17:04.256 --> 17:06.828
Trying and failing. But do you know why?

17:06.894 --> 17:09.038
Because I'm... I'm, what, Rogaine Man?

17:09.157 --> 17:10.223
Yuck. Worst name yet.

17:10.259 --> 17:13.260
But it does explain why you
keep coming back to life.

17:13.296 --> 17:15.563
Your cells regenerate
at an amazing rate.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.731
Except they don't.

17:17.766 --> 17:18.332
What?

17:18.367 --> 17:19.967
Just got the test back.

17:20.002 --> 17:22.269
No sign of abnormal
regenerative activity

17:22.305 --> 17:23.869
in blood or tissue cells.

17:23.906 --> 17:27.107
In fact,
no sign of anything abnormal at all.

17:27.143 --> 17:29.043
Told you. I'm Boring Man.

17:29.078 --> 17:31.378
Except for the contract out on my life.

17:31.414 --> 17:32.813
Just to be sure, maybe we should

17:32.848 --> 17:34.748
cut off one of his fingers,
see if it grows back.

17:34.783 --> 17:35.549
What?

17:35.584 --> 17:36.650
Just the tip.

17:36.685 --> 17:37.918
Okay, I'm done.

17:37.953 --> 17:39.553
Whoa, whoa. Where you gonna go?

17:39.588 --> 17:40.754
Home. Or not home.

17:40.789 --> 17:41.721
Somewhere safe.

17:41.757 --> 17:42.589
Where is that?

17:42.624 --> 17:43.657
My place.

17:43.692 --> 17:46.493
We have yet to unlock the
secrets of your powers.

17:46.528 --> 17:47.393
Lanie's a doctor.

17:47.429 --> 17:49.295
She can strip you down
and check you out.

17:49.331 --> 17:50.096
No!

17:50.131 --> 17:51.331
Forget it!

17:51.366 --> 17:52.832
Come on! You owe him!

17:52.867 --> 17:53.899
No. No, she doesn't!

17:53.935 --> 17:57.070
Castle, it's been a long day.
I am very overwhelmed.

17:57.105 --> 17:59.172
I just want to go back to my life.

17:59.207 --> 18:00.974
That's too bad. You can't.

18:01.009 --> 18:03.276
Spidey couldn't go back after the bite.

18:03.311 --> 18:05.678
Hulk couldn't go back after the bomb.

18:05.713 --> 18:08.113
The Ant-Man couldn't go back after...

18:08.148 --> 18:09.314
I can't remember.

18:09.350 --> 18:12.084
Point is, you have an obligation.

18:12.119 --> 18:15.153
With great power comes
great responsibility.

18:15.189 --> 18:17.756
Let's go to my place and
get some pizza on the way.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.992
There is no way I'm
going back to your place

18:20.027 --> 18:21.994
to eat pizza and explore my superpowers.

18:22.029 --> 18:24.029
I'll tell you what Gwen said about you.

18:24.064 --> 18:26.031
Okay.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.166
Hey. Where are we on the
waste-management company?

18:28.202 --> 18:30.035
It's a new entity called Bullseye.

18:30.070 --> 18:31.536
We're not sure who's running it,

18:31.571 --> 18:33.638
but rumor is it's a new
player on the scene.

18:33.673 --> 18:34.839
I don't know.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.496
Electrocution and poisoning
doesn't sound like the mob.

18:36.579 --> 18:36.975
No.

18:37.024 --> 18:38.475
Unless they're trying
to keep a low profile.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.619
The best way to stay off our
radar is to fly under it.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.313
Yeah, true.

18:42.348 --> 18:44.215
Why don't you guys head
down to the second floor,

18:44.250 --> 18:46.050
see if Organized Crime has any insight?

18:46.085 --> 18:47.151
Okay.

18:47.186 --> 18:50.221
We know you can survive
poisoning and electrocution.

18:50.256 --> 18:53.725
Now it's time to see if you
can survive penetrative wounds.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.628
How about if we start with some smaller,

18:55.694 --> 18:57.228
like a paper cut?

18:57.263 --> 18:59.330
Okay, this is all a little overwhelming.

18:59.365 --> 19:00.797
I understand. All right.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.234
Let's...
Let's test for some other powers first.

19:03.269 --> 19:04.135
Telekinesis.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.670
Try to move the piano with your mind.

19:06.705 --> 19:09.467
Oh. If I try this,
will you tell me about Gwen?

19:09.550 --> 19:11.008
Deal.

19:14.346 --> 19:15.245
Ow!

19:15.280 --> 19:16.346
What the hell?

19:16.381 --> 19:17.247
That was a trick.

19:17.282 --> 19:20.350
I was actually testing for Spidey-sense.

19:20.385 --> 19:21.585
I don't have it!

19:21.620 --> 19:22.285
Clearly.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.220
Can we take a break, please?

19:24.256 --> 19:26.122
Fine.

19:27.595 --> 19:29.887
Ah, no, no. I don't drink.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.694
All right.

19:31.729 --> 19:33.329
Do you want to know what Gwen said?

19:33.365 --> 19:34.653
Yes. Finally.

19:34.736 --> 19:37.325
All right. I'll tell you.

19:42.074 --> 19:43.039
Well?

19:43.075 --> 19:44.907
I'm telling you with my mind.

19:47.211 --> 19:49.011
- You're not getting it?
- No.

19:49.046 --> 19:50.480
Okay.

19:50.515 --> 19:52.248
Well, bad news is no telepathy.

19:52.283 --> 19:54.417
Good news is I think Gwen is into you.

19:54.452 --> 19:56.218
She told me she thinks you're funny.

19:56.254 --> 19:56.986
Really?

19:57.021 --> 19:59.021
Funny ha-ha, not funny strange?

19:59.056 --> 19:59.622
Yeah.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.023
- Yeah, what?
- Exactly.

20:01.058 --> 20:02.824
So are you gonna use your double death

20:02.860 --> 20:04.760
as a wake-up call and
finally ask her out?

20:04.795 --> 20:05.861
What if she says no?

20:05.897 --> 20:07.565
What if she says yes?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.099
Okay, I'll do it.

20:10.134 --> 20:11.400
That is the spirit, Alan.

20:11.435 --> 20:13.903
Well,
I didn't think you meant right now!

20:13.938 --> 20:16.171
Alan, there is no time like the present.

20:18.108 --> 20:19.708
[Ringing]

20:19.743 --> 20:21.142
Mm! It's ringing.

20:22.479 --> 20:23.211
This is very exciting.

20:23.246 --> 20:25.079
Oh, my God. I'm gonna be sick.

20:25.115 --> 20:26.180
I don't know what to say.

20:26.216 --> 20:27.749
- Just be yourself.
- Be myself.

20:27.785 --> 20:28.617
So, something like,

20:28.652 --> 20:29.584
"Hi, this is Alan Masters

20:29.620 --> 20:31.920
from the City Department
of Safety Inspection,

20:31.955 --> 20:34.188
- badge number 62475...
- New plan, new plan.

20:34.224 --> 20:35.589
Do not be yourself. Say this...

20:35.625 --> 20:36.757
Hi, Gwen. Hello.

20:36.793 --> 20:39.027
This is Alan Masters of...

20:39.062 --> 20:40.361
Yes, that's right.

20:40.397 --> 20:42.964
I'm much better, thanks. You?

20:42.999 --> 20:44.265
Oh, nothing.

20:44.301 --> 20:46.935
I was just calling to see

20:46.970 --> 20:50.771
if you wanted to have dinner with me.

20:50.807 --> 20:51.439
Oh.

20:51.474 --> 20:54.575
Okay. I'll see you there.

20:54.610 --> 20:55.609
Bye.

20:55.645 --> 20:57.244
[Beep]

20:57.279 --> 20:58.312
She said yes.

20:58.347 --> 20:59.747
Well done, Alan!

20:59.782 --> 21:01.882
Now all we have to do is
plan the perfect date.

21:01.918 --> 21:02.950
How much time do we have?

21:02.985 --> 21:05.218
Well, we're meeting at
Botticelli's in 30 minutes?

21:05.254 --> 21:07.787
Tonight? You said yourself
it's time to start living.

21:07.823 --> 21:09.389
Yes, I just thought it would
be after we apprehended

21:09.425 --> 21:10.257
your would-be murderer.

21:10.292 --> 21:14.261
I know. I will just embrace my powers.

21:14.296 --> 21:16.096
Maybe this is my origin story,

21:16.131 --> 21:17.164
and my dinner with Gwen

21:17.199 --> 21:19.833
will be the beginning of
something really terrific!

21:19.868 --> 21:21.768
That's the spirit, Alan.
And I'm going with you.

21:21.803 --> 21:22.602
Please don't.

21:22.637 --> 21:23.937
The first two attempts on your life

21:23.972 --> 21:25.104
were meant to be anonymous, quiet.

21:25.139 --> 21:27.640
It's very unlikely they'd try
something in a public place.

21:27.676 --> 21:28.575
Exactly.

21:28.610 --> 21:29.742
Well, they did fail twice.

21:29.778 --> 21:31.277
They may try to kick it up a notch.

21:31.312 --> 21:33.079
What are you saying?

21:33.114 --> 21:34.781
Don't order an appetizer.

21:40.654 --> 21:42.254
You found something.

21:42.290 --> 21:43.255
Yeah.

21:43.291 --> 21:44.123
I ran the partial plate

21:44.158 --> 21:46.592
from that S.U.V. Caleb Brown got into,

21:46.627 --> 21:48.327
generated a list of names.

21:48.363 --> 21:49.328
Guess who's on it.

21:49.364 --> 21:50.329
Brooks.

21:50.365 --> 21:52.298
Guy with the bag of spiders

21:52.333 --> 21:54.133
who tried to take down Castle and me.

21:54.168 --> 21:56.168
If Brooks picked up
Caleb at the airport,

21:56.204 --> 21:58.169
then this ties Caleb directly to LokSat.

21:58.205 --> 21:59.971
Well, look, it's a start anyway.

22:00.006 --> 22:01.873
A start? It's photographic evidence.

22:01.908 --> 22:04.375
Of what?
That he got into a car with a bad guy?

22:04.410 --> 22:07.211
Caleb's a public defender.
He represents bad guys.

22:07.246 --> 22:08.379
He was using an alias.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.314
We can use this to go at Caleb,

22:10.349 --> 22:12.282
get him to reveal LokSat's identity.

22:12.318 --> 22:14.519
Until he alerts LokSat
that we're onto him,

22:14.554 --> 22:16.168
and then we're all dead.

22:16.729 --> 22:19.323
No, we got to wait until we
have something more concrete.

22:19.358 --> 22:20.124
Fine.

22:20.159 --> 22:21.291
Caleb's alias... Peter McCaffery.

22:21.327 --> 22:22.259
I'll look into and see

22:22.294 --> 22:24.694
what other trips he's
taken under that name,

22:24.730 --> 22:26.863
see if it leads somewhere
more definitive.

22:26.899 --> 22:28.965
Look, I know this is frustrating.

22:29.001 --> 22:30.234
But we're getting close.

22:30.269 --> 22:32.602
We just have to tread carefully.

22:38.427 --> 22:39.726
There she is. [Gasps]

22:39.762 --> 22:41.728
She looks nice.

22:44.132 --> 22:47.501
This is a huge mistake.
I'm a safety inspector.

22:47.536 --> 22:49.936
That's not even a little sexy.

22:49.971 --> 22:52.538
This is so much scarier than dying.

22:52.573 --> 22:55.108
You are Alan Masters, superhero.

22:55.143 --> 22:56.742
Chicks dig superheroes.

22:56.778 --> 22:58.878
Should I tell her I'm a superhero?

22:58.914 --> 23:00.880
I wouldn't open with that.

23:00.916 --> 23:01.948
Okay.

23:01.983 --> 23:03.349
I'm going in.

23:03.385 --> 23:04.951
Wish me luck.

23:04.986 --> 23:06.051
Good luck.

23:07.288 --> 23:08.521
[Laughing] Hi, Gwen.

23:08.556 --> 23:09.254
Hi.

23:09.290 --> 23:11.123
- Wow, you...
- Good to see you.

23:11.158 --> 23:12.391
- Oh.
- You look...

23:12.427 --> 23:13.893
- Oh!
- You look great.

23:13.928 --> 23:15.795
Thanks for having dinner with me.

23:15.830 --> 23:18.230
I was surprised that you called,
after the day you've had.

23:18.265 --> 23:20.098
- What a day, right? Crazy.
- Yeah.

23:20.134 --> 23:22.200
Just nuts. I...

23:22.236 --> 23:24.636
I-I-I'm a superhero.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.238
What?

23:26.273 --> 23:28.373
Nothing. I sneezed.

23:28.409 --> 23:30.409
You... You sneezed, "I'm a superhero"?

23:30.444 --> 23:31.643
Yeah. Allergies.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.312
[Sneezes] Superhero! Excuse me.

23:33.347 --> 23:35.613
[Sniffles]

23:38.852 --> 23:41.152
[Cellphone rings]

23:41.187 --> 23:42.887
Hey, Ryan.

23:42.923 --> 23:44.989
We I.D.'d the owner of
Bullseye Waste Management.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.324
He's a guy named Horatio Spate.

23:46.359 --> 23:47.959
That's a good supervillain name.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.093
This is not a joke.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.128
Spate is suspected of
executing over a dozen people.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.297
I texted you his picture just
to put him on your radar.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.232
Whatever you do, don't leave the loft.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.600
Don't leave the loft. Got it.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.269
[Laughter] Wait, what's that noise?

23:58.304 --> 24:00.104
Uh...

24:04.110 --> 24:06.210
[Indistinct conversations]

24:10.683 --> 24:12.282
Crap.

24:13.668 --> 24:16.081
- Hello, Alan.
- Do I know you?

24:16.169 --> 24:18.470
Sorry to interrupt your romantic dinner.

24:18.505 --> 24:20.505
Careful, Alan. He's your archnemesis.

24:20.540 --> 24:23.608
Seriously? I have an archnemesis?

24:23.643 --> 24:25.943
Is that how they dress?

24:25.979 --> 24:28.479
Alan, you're cute and I like you,

24:28.514 --> 24:30.314
but this is all a bit much.

24:30.350 --> 24:34.352
You say that you're a superhero,
and he's a supervillain.

24:34.387 --> 24:37.088
So does that make you his sidekick?

24:37.123 --> 24:39.656
Sidekick? Please. I'm the mentor.

24:39.692 --> 24:40.691
And I'm his date.

24:40.726 --> 24:42.693
Or at least I was.

24:42.728 --> 24:45.462
I'm sorry. This is just weird.

24:45.498 --> 24:48.632
And she thinks I'm crazy.
Thank you so much.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.534
This is all your fault.

24:50.569 --> 24:51.968
Actually, it's his.

24:52.004 --> 24:53.804
Alan, meet Horatio Spate.

24:53.839 --> 24:56.973
He's the new owner of
Bullseye Waste Management.

24:57.009 --> 24:59.142
So,
you're the one who's trying to kill me?

24:59.177 --> 25:01.444
Hardly. If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead already.

25:01.479 --> 25:04.014
Well, what do you want?

25:04.049 --> 25:05.282
An arrangement.

25:05.317 --> 25:07.717
One that would benefit both of us.

25:07.752 --> 25:09.652
Twice someone's tried to kill you.

25:09.687 --> 25:11.121
And you're still with us.

25:11.156 --> 25:13.323
How long before Lady Luck abandons you?

25:13.358 --> 25:14.190
Oh, let me guess.

25:14.226 --> 25:17.027
A man like you can offer protection.

25:17.062 --> 25:19.061
More than offer. I can guarantee it.

25:19.096 --> 25:22.398
In return,
all I ask is that you adopt a more

25:22.434 --> 25:26.402
laissez-faire interpretation
of your inspection policies.

25:26.438 --> 25:27.403
This is a moral test.

25:27.439 --> 25:31.006
Every superhero is presented
with a moral dilemma

25:31.042 --> 25:32.542
by the villain, trying to corrupt him.

25:32.577 --> 25:36.545
Horatio Spate, my answer is no.

25:36.580 --> 25:38.580
Gun, gun.

25:38.615 --> 25:40.916
Relax, boys.

25:40.952 --> 25:41.984
It's ginkgo.

25:42.019 --> 25:43.552
Just started taking it.

25:43.587 --> 25:45.054
Here's what it does.

25:45.089 --> 25:48.257
It improves memory,
it sharpens brain function,

25:48.292 --> 25:51.927
and it helps a person make really,
really good decisions.

25:51.962 --> 25:53.695
Perhaps you should try one,

25:53.730 --> 25:56.164
then you can rethink your answer.

25:56.199 --> 25:58.500
Careful.

25:58.535 --> 26:01.235
Dangerous out there.

26:01.271 --> 26:04.038
It's as if he stepped off
the pages of a graphic novel.

26:04.074 --> 26:06.407
You should have been there
to see him in person.

26:06.443 --> 26:07.842
Yes. <i>They</i> should have.

26:07.877 --> 26:09.510
Not you, and definitely not Alan.

26:09.545 --> 26:11.579
Now,
tell me how dangerous it was for you

26:11.614 --> 26:14.415
to take him out in public,
'cause I know that you knew.

26:14.451 --> 26:17.385
He's in love, Beckett. And I love love.

26:17.420 --> 26:20.355
And I'm sorry, and I won't do it again.

26:20.390 --> 26:21.922
No, you won't, and you know why?

26:21.958 --> 26:24.191
Because I've had him
sent to a real safe house

26:24.226 --> 26:25.392
until we track down Horatio.

26:25.427 --> 26:27.928
Boss, I know we were talking
about flying under the radar,

26:27.964 --> 26:30.130
but that really doesn't
seem to be Horatio's style.

26:30.165 --> 26:31.866
I mean, he solves problems with bullets,

26:31.901 --> 26:34.468
not poisons and elaborate
electrocution traps.

26:34.504 --> 26:36.804
So why would he guarantee protection?

26:36.839 --> 26:40.273
Oh, maybe he knows the actual
identity of our would-be killer.

26:40.309 --> 26:42.075
And stopping the hit could benefit

26:42.111 --> 26:44.878
his waste-disposal company by
giving him leverage on Alan.

26:44.913 --> 26:47.614
Are any of Horatio's associates
recent buyers of TTX?

26:47.649 --> 26:50.484
'Cause that could help us narrow
down who's trying to kill Alan.

26:50.519 --> 26:52.519
We've got the list right here.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.623
Wait a minute.
Lucky Dragon Herbologists?

26:56.658 --> 27:00.693
Horatio had a pillbox
with a dragon logo on it.

27:03.264 --> 27:04.898
That's it. That's the same logo.

27:04.933 --> 27:07.767
It says here that it's a front

27:07.802 --> 27:09.636
for the White Lotus Chinese Triad.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.771
Okay, so how does an international gang

27:11.806 --> 27:13.506
get cleared to possess TTX?

27:13.541 --> 27:15.741
Because Lucky Dragon is
a legitimate business

27:15.776 --> 27:18.644
and there are small doses
of TTX in Eastern medicine.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.479
Hold up. This doesn't make sense.

27:20.515 --> 27:21.647
According to Intel,

27:21.682 --> 27:24.750
the Triad sees Horatio as a
threat to their territory.

27:24.785 --> 27:26.485
They're gearing up for war.

27:26.521 --> 27:29.522
So, no way is Horatio
guaranteeing Alan's safety

27:29.557 --> 27:30.689
with the Triads.

27:30.724 --> 27:31.657
Unless...

27:31.692 --> 27:34.693
Horatio said he just
started taking ginkgo.

27:34.728 --> 27:36.662
What if the two empires
are hammering out

27:36.697 --> 27:37.729
some kind of an alliance?

27:37.765 --> 27:39.865
An alliance that Alan
unknowingly stumbled onto

27:39.900 --> 27:41.934
and put him right in the
cross hairs of the Triad.

27:41.969 --> 27:44.937
But what could bring two warring
gangs together to join forces?

27:44.972 --> 27:47.539
Well, get a search warrant
for Lucky Dragon Herbologists

27:47.574 --> 27:49.006
and find out.

27:50.510 --> 27:51.276
Hey.

27:51.311 --> 27:52.510
Uh, Caleb.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.611
What are you doing here?

27:53.646 --> 27:54.579
I hate to bother you,

27:54.614 --> 27:55.947
but I could really use
your help with a client.

27:55.982 --> 27:57.382
Can I borrow you for a quick minute?

27:57.417 --> 27:59.817
Yeah, sure.

28:02.189 --> 28:03.520
So, who is this client?

28:03.556 --> 28:06.123
I think you're familiar with him...

28:06.158 --> 28:07.357
Peter McCaffery.

28:07.393 --> 28:10.962
Uh, no, it... It doesn't sound familiar.

28:10.997 --> 28:11.963
No?

28:11.998 --> 28:13.397
Let me fill you in.

28:13.432 --> 28:15.633
So, there's this overzealous cop.

28:15.668 --> 28:18.469
You know the type.
She never knows when to give up.

28:18.504 --> 28:19.403
And she has her tech guy

28:19.438 --> 28:21.871
look into Peter
McCaffery's recent travel.

28:21.907 --> 28:22.939
Okay.

28:22.975 --> 28:26.009
Yeah, well,
Mr. McCaffery's a very private person,

28:26.044 --> 28:29.480
so he set up some unexpected
digital trip wires.

28:29.515 --> 28:32.149
That's bad news for the
tech guy and his boss.

28:32.184 --> 28:33.049
And so this cop,

28:33.085 --> 28:35.752
she keeps marching
toward this kill zone,

28:35.787 --> 28:37.721
and unless she makes an about-face,

28:37.756 --> 28:39.555
it is not going to end well.

28:41.259 --> 28:42.491
I don't get it.

28:42.526 --> 28:45.560
You served a full term
in the Peace Corps.

28:45.596 --> 28:47.162
You worked for the EPA.

28:47.197 --> 28:49.865
You brought legal action
against corrupt corporations.

28:49.900 --> 28:50.733
What's your point, Kate?

28:50.768 --> 28:51.800
What happened?

28:51.836 --> 28:54.239
You used to make a difference.
Why did you sell out?

28:56.073 --> 28:57.305
Look.

28:57.341 --> 29:01.376
My client is forced to work
for a man that he cannot fight.

29:01.411 --> 29:04.579
And take my word for it.
Neither can you.

29:04.615 --> 29:07.415
Let's help each other out here.

29:07.451 --> 29:09.417
We can bring down LokSat.

29:09.453 --> 29:12.354
I'm giving you a second
chance to make a difference.

29:14.270 --> 29:16.791
Captain, just do yourself a favor, hmm?

29:16.826 --> 29:19.093
Heed my warning.

29:19.129 --> 29:21.863
No, you heed mine.

29:21.898 --> 29:24.699
You have until 8:00 tomorrow night.

29:24.734 --> 29:25.566
Then what?

29:25.601 --> 29:27.468
I'll expose you.

29:27.503 --> 29:29.971
And then we'll both be
looking over our shoulders,

29:30.006 --> 29:32.139
waiting for LokSat to tie up loose ends.

29:32.175 --> 29:34.708
Because once they find out
that your cover is blown

29:34.743 --> 29:35.576
and I'm onto you,

29:35.611 --> 29:37.711
then you're gonna be as dead as I am.

29:37.746 --> 29:39.780
Seven minutes, Kate.

29:39.815 --> 29:40.847
Seven minutes.

29:40.883 --> 29:43.284
That's how long the brain
continues to function

29:43.319 --> 29:44.385
after the body dies,

29:44.420 --> 29:47.087
and as all of those synapses
slowly stop firing off,

29:47.122 --> 29:49.056
that's when they say that our lives

29:49.091 --> 29:50.290
flash before our eyes.

29:50.325 --> 29:52.726
Now, when your seven minutes come,

29:52.761 --> 29:55.962
I sincerely hope that you
do not flash to this moment,

29:55.998 --> 29:59.299
when you had a chance to
live and you chose not to.

30:04.272 --> 30:06.405
Hey.

30:06.441 --> 30:07.773
Hey.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.442
Do you want me to handle that?

30:09.477 --> 30:11.010
You're on edge this morning.

30:11.045 --> 30:12.778
On edge? Why would I be on edge?

30:12.813 --> 30:15.348
Because LokSat's henchman
knows we're onto him

30:15.383 --> 30:17.583
and assassins could come
through the door at any second.

30:17.619 --> 30:19.240
I mean, why aren't you on edge?

30:19.306 --> 30:21.754
Well, Caleb is a lot of things,
but he's not suicidal,

30:21.789 --> 30:23.722
and working with us
is his only recourse.

30:23.758 --> 30:25.412
He threatened your life.

30:25.478 --> 30:26.483
Because he was scared.

30:26.582 --> 30:28.149
Trust me, Castle. I turned him.

30:28.330 --> 30:29.963
I'm positive he's gonna come in today.

30:30.012 --> 30:31.315
Oh, yeah, I think he's coming in, too.

30:31.398 --> 30:32.931
Well,
either him or LokSat's kill squads.

30:32.967 --> 30:33.766
- Hey.
- Hey!

30:33.801 --> 30:34.933
Geez.

30:34.969 --> 30:37.536
So, Judge Kober just denied
our search warrant request

30:37.571 --> 30:39.263
for The Lucky Dragon.

30:39.395 --> 30:40.863
A suspected Triad front.

30:40.929 --> 30:43.963
Does she know that we like them
for two attempts on Alan's life?

30:44.079 --> 30:45.644
Says we still need probable cause.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.234
Okay,
we got to go at this a different way.

30:48.531 --> 30:49.814
You know, if Horatio and the Triads

30:49.849 --> 30:52.390
are working together,
this is something big.

30:52.588 --> 30:54.052
Guys.

30:54.087 --> 30:55.820
I know how to get in.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.254
Stick to the plan.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.757
Relax. I totally got this.

30:59.793 --> 31:03.094
Welcome to Lucky Dragon
herbs and remedies.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.495
Can I help you?

31:04.530 --> 31:07.832
Surprise safety inspection.

31:09.393 --> 31:11.502
FYI, sir, he's holding out a badge

31:11.537 --> 31:13.571
that says Department
of Safety and Health

31:13.606 --> 31:15.573
and he's got a serious look on his face.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.174
Very serious look.

31:17.210 --> 31:19.910
Okay. But why two inspectors?

31:21.678 --> 31:24.348
Uh, because he is my trainee...

31:24.383 --> 31:25.382
Trainee.

31:25.418 --> 31:28.418
And it helps to have
a second set of eyes.

31:28.453 --> 31:30.120
Not that one set of eyes

31:30.155 --> 31:32.856
or no sets of eyes is a bad thing.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.858
Bring all the eyes you would like.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.793
I'm sure you'll find my medicines

31:36.829 --> 31:39.091
violate none of your Western laws.

31:39.420 --> 31:41.497
We'll be the judge of that.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.066
[Coughs]

31:45.903 --> 31:47.470
I ask we stay together

31:47.505 --> 31:50.673
so I may address your
inspection concerns.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.251
Of course.

31:54.027 --> 31:57.113
I'll cause a distraction.
You slip to the back room.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.682
Here are some of my most precious herbs.

31:59.718 --> 32:02.451
Impossible to grow in this country.

32:02.486 --> 32:04.646
Oh, you mean these herbs right here?

32:11.395 --> 32:12.828
Your assistant's very clumsy.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.063
Yes, he is.

32:14.098 --> 32:17.199
Which is why the sooner we get
out of your way, the better.

32:17.235 --> 32:19.200
Take us to your back room now, please.

32:19.236 --> 32:21.002
But of course.

32:22.005 --> 32:24.506
Wait. I sense something.

32:25.721 --> 32:26.841
Something powerful.

32:26.877 --> 32:29.578
An unnatural presence
in the order of things.

32:29.613 --> 32:30.845
What kind of presence?

32:30.881 --> 32:32.080
What kind, indeed?

32:32.115 --> 32:33.649
When is a man not a man?

32:33.684 --> 32:36.084
When his life-force
cannot be extinguished,

32:36.119 --> 32:38.419
when he cannot die.

32:38.454 --> 32:40.521
Then he is a god.

32:40.556 --> 32:42.190
I think he senses your powers.

32:42.225 --> 32:43.158
Yeah? You do?

32:43.193 --> 32:44.759
Either that or he's
buying time while his guys

32:44.795 --> 32:47.228
get the contraband out the back door.

32:48.799 --> 32:49.831
You guys drop the cases.

32:49.866 --> 32:52.500
NYPD. On your knees, fellas.

33:03.946 --> 33:04.878
What the hell is this?

33:04.914 --> 33:05.879
Lanie: Heroin.

33:05.915 --> 33:08.182
Castle:
Since when does heroin look like that?

33:08.217 --> 33:09.917
Since it's synthetic heroin,

33:09.952 --> 33:12.752
an opioid manufactured to
replicate a heroin high.

33:12.788 --> 33:15.122
In fact,
this stuff actually improves on it

33:15.157 --> 33:17.691
because,
according to the analysis I ran,

33:17.726 --> 33:18.926
it's laced with TTX.

33:18.961 --> 33:21.061
The same poison that almost killed me?

33:21.096 --> 33:23.263
What, heroin isn't dangerous enough?

33:23.299 --> 33:26.098
Because that poison works
by blocking synapses.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.802
In small doses,
it's a powerful analgesic

33:28.837 --> 33:31.971
specifically used for the
pain of heroin withdrawal.

33:32.006 --> 33:33.440
So it makes the drug more addictive

33:33.475 --> 33:34.974
by reducing the painful side effects.

33:35.009 --> 33:36.209
So more addictive heroin

33:36.244 --> 33:38.611
that doesn't have to be smuggled
into the country because...

33:38.647 --> 33:41.214
Because it can be made right
here in the good old U.S. of A.

33:41.249 --> 33:42.715
That explains why the Triads and Horatio

33:42.750 --> 33:44.483
are willing to put
their difference aside,

33:44.518 --> 33:47.086
because synthetic heroin
could be worth billions.

33:47.121 --> 33:48.921
What does this have to do with me?

33:48.957 --> 33:50.056
Why would anybody want me dead?

33:50.091 --> 33:52.892
Well, clearly this stuff
is made in a lab somewhere,

33:52.927 --> 33:55.328
and your job is to inspect laboratories,
so...

33:55.363 --> 33:57.996
You know, this shade of
yellow looks very familiar.

33:58.031 --> 33:59.998
What is it that gives it this color?

34:00.033 --> 34:03.068
An inorganic catalyst
commonly referred to as L.A.H.

34:03.103 --> 34:05.303
Lithium aluminum hydride?

34:05.339 --> 34:07.806
That is the same chemical that spilled

34:07.842 --> 34:09.908
when I was inspecting Zantium Labs.

34:10.553 --> 34:12.010
This is why they wanted you dead.

34:12.045 --> 34:14.246
When the synthetic
heroin hits the streets,

34:14.281 --> 34:16.681
it'll come out that it
was made with L.A.H.

34:16.716 --> 34:18.449
And since you knew the lab had purchased

34:18.485 --> 34:19.617
large amounts of L.A.H...

34:19.652 --> 34:20.818
They couldn't take the risk

34:20.853 --> 34:22.120
that I might see something on the news,

34:22.155 --> 34:23.621
put the pieces together,

34:23.656 --> 34:25.590
- and report it to the authorities.
- Which means...

34:25.625 --> 34:26.686
Someone at Zantium Labs
is trying to kill me!

34:26.768 --> 34:28.746
Someone at Zantium Labs
is trying to kill you!

34:28.828 --> 34:30.094
Oh, my God. Is that what we sound like?

34:30.129 --> 34:31.027
Certainly hope not.

34:31.063 --> 34:33.163
I mean,
it was cute but just overly cute.

34:33.199 --> 34:33.964
Alan.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.032
Huh?

34:35.067 --> 34:37.034
Do you know who ordered
the L.A.H. for Zantium?

34:37.069 --> 34:38.770
I do. Mike Lin, the lead chemist.

34:38.804 --> 34:41.005
I remember seeing his name
on the purchase order.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.840
He's probably the guy
who's trying to kill me.

34:42.876 --> 34:43.875
He could be very dangerous.

34:43.909 --> 34:46.543
We need to get down there
and figure something out

34:46.578 --> 34:47.978
before he hurts someone else.

34:48.014 --> 34:49.947
No. We have to be very smart about this.

34:49.982 --> 34:51.882
There is no way that Mike, a chemist,

34:51.918 --> 34:53.150
would be working alone here,

34:53.185 --> 34:56.553
so we have to get a court order
to impound the entire laboratory

34:56.588 --> 34:59.523
and make sure that nobody
destroys any of the evidence.

34:59.558 --> 35:00.891
Well, how long will that take?

35:00.927 --> 35:02.559
Don't worry. We'll get this guy.

35:05.764 --> 35:06.963
Oh, Castle. There you are.

35:06.998 --> 35:07.964
We got the warrant. Let's go.

35:07.999 --> 35:09.553
Yeah. Where's Alan?

35:09.751 --> 35:10.933
I thought he was with you guys.

35:12.703 --> 35:14.002
Oh, no.

35:23.273 --> 35:24.212
Gwen!

35:25.153 --> 35:26.514
Alan. What are you doing here?

35:26.550 --> 35:29.017
Come with me if you want to live.

35:35.625 --> 35:36.724
Alan, what is going on?

35:36.760 --> 35:39.928
Mike Lin is secretly making
synthetic heroin in the lab.

35:39.964 --> 35:42.063
He's the one who's trying to kill me.

35:42.098 --> 35:44.098
Oh, my God. Alan, are you sure?

35:44.133 --> 35:45.600
Yeah. But don't worry.

35:45.635 --> 35:46.935
The cops are on the way,

35:46.970 --> 35:49.170
and until then, I'll protect you.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.106
This'll work.

35:52.141 --> 35:55.877
Yeah, if that old blind guy
could use it, so could I.

35:56.770 --> 35:59.613
Or... Or that's actually better.

35:59.648 --> 36:02.049
Wait. Why do you have a gun?

36:02.085 --> 36:03.884
- I'm gonna kill Mike.
- No.

36:03.919 --> 36:05.453
No, no, no. The cops will arrest him.

36:05.488 --> 36:06.954
That's what I'm afraid of.

36:06.990 --> 36:07.989
Mike is the only person here

36:08.024 --> 36:09.690
who knows that I'm running
this drug operation.

36:09.725 --> 36:11.225
What?

36:11.260 --> 36:14.887
Wait, you're the one who poisoned me?

36:14.936 --> 36:16.630
And electrocuted you, yeah.

36:16.665 --> 36:18.031
I was trying to be discreet.

36:18.066 --> 36:19.432
I mean, my boyfriend Horatio

36:19.468 --> 36:21.869
said I should just shoot
you in the head, but...

36:21.904 --> 36:23.069
Hold on! Stop everything!

36:23.105 --> 36:24.137
Wha...

36:24.172 --> 36:26.172
Horatio is your boyfriend?

36:27.610 --> 36:30.410
So I guess a second date
is out of the question?

36:30.445 --> 36:32.047
Aww, Alan.

36:32.344 --> 36:34.881
You seriously thought a guy
like you had a shot with me?

36:34.916 --> 36:35.681
Ow.

36:36.186 --> 36:38.751
I thought dying twice was painful.

36:38.786 --> 36:41.054
Well,
maybe it won't be so bad the third time.

36:44.065 --> 36:46.692
- Police!
- Nobody move! NYPD!

36:46.799 --> 36:47.865
Right now! Put up your hands!

36:47.900 --> 36:49.799
Get 'em up!
Get your hands where we can see 'em!

36:50.188 --> 36:52.101
Hands. Hands.

36:55.874 --> 36:57.274
Any sign of Alan?

36:57.309 --> 36:58.408
No, not yet.

36:58.443 --> 36:59.643
I'm sure he came here.

36:59.678 --> 37:01.720
See if you can find Gwen's office.

37:13.391 --> 37:14.490
Alan!

37:21.032 --> 37:22.825
Oh, no.

37:27.838 --> 37:29.838
This is my fault.

37:31.542 --> 37:34.478
I forced the superhero mantle onto him.

37:34.692 --> 37:37.179
I filled his head with crazy
ideas of being invulnerable,

37:37.215 --> 37:39.514
and then, like some superhero Icarus,

37:39.549 --> 37:41.316
he flew too close to the sun.

37:41.351 --> 37:44.352
Alan, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.721
I let you down!

37:45.756 --> 37:46.888
Thank you.

37:46.924 --> 37:48.023
Don't mention it.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.657
Alan! You're alive?

37:49.693 --> 37:50.792
Shh! Not so loud.

37:50.828 --> 37:52.360
I've got a splitting headache.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.729
I'll, uh, call an ambulance?

37:54.764 --> 37:56.464
Relax. I'm fine.

37:56.499 --> 37:58.833
I just need a couple of Advil.

37:58.868 --> 38:00.167
What? What is it, Castle?

38:00.203 --> 38:02.036
You...

38:02.071 --> 38:04.038
Did I get shot in the head?

38:04.073 --> 38:05.840
Right in the middle!
I mean, how did you even...

38:05.875 --> 38:07.575
Wait,
that means you've seen your killer.

38:07.611 --> 38:08.209
Who... Who was it?

38:08.245 --> 38:10.511
You're never gonna guess.

38:10.547 --> 38:11.578
Yo. I took her down

38:11.614 --> 38:14.581
just before she put a
bullet in Mike the chemist.

38:14.617 --> 38:17.184
Why the hell won't you die?

38:19.388 --> 38:20.965
I never thought she was right for you.

38:22.859 --> 38:25.359
Coolest thing ever.

38:25.394 --> 38:26.460
[Cellphone clicks]

38:26.495 --> 38:29.563
As you can see,
the slug pierced but didn't penetrate

38:29.598 --> 38:31.732
the vertical plate of Alan's skull.

38:31.767 --> 38:32.766
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

38:32.801 --> 38:35.602
I realize it was only
a .22-caliber revolver,

38:35.638 --> 38:37.937
but it was fired at point-blank range.

38:37.973 --> 38:40.874
Hey, you sound a little
upset that I'm still alive.

38:40.909 --> 38:43.410
No. It's just... Oh, come on.

38:43.445 --> 38:45.845
I don't suppose you have
an explanation this time.

38:45.881 --> 38:49.582
Well, considering he's already
died three times in 48 hours,

38:49.617 --> 38:51.084
does it even matter?

38:51.119 --> 38:52.518
Welcome to the club.

38:52.553 --> 38:55.188
Alan,
it's my professional medical opinion

38:55.223 --> 38:58.124
that you're the luckiest
man who's ever lived

38:58.160 --> 39:00.593
and kept living even after he died.

39:00.628 --> 39:01.460
Thanks, Doc.

39:01.496 --> 39:02.861
How you feeling?

39:02.897 --> 39:04.797
You know, I'm grateful.

39:04.832 --> 39:07.199
Especially for the new friend I made.

39:08.107 --> 39:10.770
I sure hope we could stay in touch.

39:10.805 --> 39:12.571
Are you kidding? You and me?

39:12.607 --> 39:14.774
This is the start of a beautiful...

39:14.809 --> 39:16.642
I don't think he's talking to you.

39:16.678 --> 39:18.610
[Cellphone rings]
Hey, maybe you have a few

39:18.645 --> 39:20.478
secret powers we haven't seen yet.

39:20.514 --> 39:22.114
Which is what I've
been saying all along.

39:22.149 --> 39:24.582
But perhaps discovery of those abilities

39:24.618 --> 39:26.584
is best left to a medical expert.

39:26.620 --> 39:28.120
Buh-bye, Castle.

39:28.155 --> 39:29.454
- Get to stepping.
- Thank you.

39:32.693 --> 39:34.659
Okay, yeah, thanks.

39:34.695 --> 39:35.893
That was Vikram.

39:35.929 --> 39:38.996
The DEA just arrested Horatio
and a few members of the Triad.

39:39.032 --> 39:39.831
So, what's wrong?

39:39.866 --> 39:42.233
Caleb's deadline has come and gone

39:42.268 --> 39:44.402
and Vikram's said that he's disappeared.

39:44.438 --> 39:45.303
He gone off-grid.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.471
He's running.

39:46.506 --> 39:48.740
Too scared to face LokSat,
too scared to work with us.

39:48.775 --> 39:50.774
Which means we just lost our only lead.

39:50.810 --> 39:52.509
So, what do we do?

39:52.545 --> 39:55.679
I don't know. Maybe you're right.

39:55.715 --> 39:58.349
Maybe it is time for a change.

39:58.384 --> 40:01.518
I hear Paris is nice this time of year.

40:01.554 --> 40:05.289
So long as I'm with you,
I'll go anywhere.

40:09.362 --> 40:11.094
Oh, don't... Don't shoot me.

40:11.129 --> 40:12.796
I might spill my Scotch.

40:12.832 --> 40:14.765
I think you mean <i>my</i> Scotch.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.835
And my most expensive Scotch.

40:17.870 --> 40:19.519
It's worth it.

40:20.541 --> 40:22.223
You had a change of heart, Caleb?

40:22.388 --> 40:24.274
You know, every morning we wake up

40:24.309 --> 40:26.642
and we choose who we want to be.

40:26.678 --> 40:30.981
I wake up and I ask myself,
"Why are you choosing this?"

40:31.016 --> 40:34.817
Because you're right, Kate.
I was a good guy once.

40:34.853 --> 40:36.619
And you still can be.

40:37.923 --> 40:39.489
Who is LokSat?

40:39.927 --> 40:42.458
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on. You work for him.

40:42.494 --> 40:43.393
Yes.

40:43.428 --> 40:45.628
But I started out
working for his partner.

40:45.663 --> 40:47.663
- Senator William Bracken?
- Mm-hmm.

40:47.699 --> 40:50.366
So, what, LokSat inherited you?

40:50.402 --> 40:51.667
It was more like drafted.

40:51.703 --> 40:53.068
After Bracken's murder,

40:53.104 --> 40:55.705
I received this on my
doorstep with a note.

40:55.740 --> 40:58.240
And I quote, "Mr. Brown,
you now work for me.

40:58.276 --> 41:01.643
This cellphone is enabled with
GPS and will only function

41:01.678 --> 41:03.812
at the northernmost end of Astor Park.

41:03.847 --> 41:07.249
Be there every third Monday
of the month at 8:00 a.m.

41:07.285 --> 41:08.683
to receive your orders.

41:08.719 --> 41:10.485
Kate, it's yours.

41:10.521 --> 41:12.554
And hopefully you can
trace LokSat's next call.

41:12.589 --> 41:14.355
Mnh-mnh. They're gonna know I'm not you.

41:14.391 --> 41:16.658
We don't have a conversation.
The phone rings, I answer.

41:16.693 --> 41:19.093
An electronically modified
voice gives me instructions.

41:19.129 --> 41:21.563
It lasts no more than 60 seconds,

41:21.598 --> 41:23.665
so have your best people ready.

41:31.741 --> 41:32.606
Where are you going?

41:32.642 --> 41:33.874
Um...

41:33.910 --> 41:37.178
I'm gonna go to the same places
that I always go... work, home.

41:37.213 --> 41:39.414
I'm gonna act as if nothing has changed.

41:39.449 --> 41:41.715
Yeah, but it has.
And we can protect you.

41:41.751 --> 41:43.684
All I want from you is your promise

41:43.719 --> 41:45.753
that you will see this thing through.

41:45.788 --> 41:48.522
And remember who I chose to be today

41:48.558 --> 41:50.357
because nobody else will.

41:50.392 --> 41:52.926
That's a damn fine Scotch, Rick.

41:57.899 --> 42:01.435
This is it. It's our one shot at LokSat.

42:01.470 --> 42:02.535
Yeah.

42:02.571 --> 42:05.905
And when the time comes,
we're gonna make it count.
