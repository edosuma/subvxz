WEBVTT

00:33.801 --> 00:34.968
Can I have a sweet?

00:35.103 --> 00:36.870
You've got to wait
till we get there.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.507
But I'm hungry.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.708
Just go that way.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.377
You keep changing it.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.745
Go on. Just go that way

00:44.878 --> 00:46.547
and then I'll give you a sweet.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.034
Sam?

01:14.041 --> 01:15.576
Sam?!

01:35.429 --> 01:36.597
Hey, Sam.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.636
You still want a sweet?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.514
So, it sounds like
you had a bit of a shock.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.783
That's why your mum called me, okay?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.751
Do you think you could tell me
what you saw?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.152
They won't say.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.190
Alright, it's okay.

03:44.792 --> 03:48.329
Now, you know you're not
in any trouble. Alright?

03:49.930 --> 03:54.201
It just sometimes helps to...
to talk about things. Hmm?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.908
It was an angel.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.976
She had wings.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.314
Angels fly, you idiot.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.350
Maybe she fell.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.787
Maybe the angel was sleeping.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.858
Can you remember
where you saw her?

04:20.594 --> 04:23.564
Willow Hole.
In the woods.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.599
Can't you give them something?

04:25.733 --> 04:28.669
Uh, yeah, you... you wanna...?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.909
So, the best medicine is rest.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.277
Keep their routines.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.846
If you notice any changes
to their behaviour,

04:38.979 --> 04:40.147
give me a call,
day or night.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.584
Erm, and we'll see how
they get on.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.753
Counselling is something
we can look at, if you...

04:45.886 --> 04:48.756
I'll let you try and convince
Gary of that.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.223
Can we go out now?

04:50.358 --> 04:52.826
Yeah, only in the garden.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.927
- Come on.
- Okay.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.963
Don't go any further.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.665
Your dad's on his way home.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.238
He'll only get 'em filthy again

05:05.373 --> 05:07.775
the minute
he steps on the pitch.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.877
But Gary...

05:10.010 --> 05:12.045
It's all about appearances.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.816
You know, we don't know
what they saw.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.218
I think
it might be Sally Palmer.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.988
What makes you say that?

05:23.023 --> 05:25.793
I had a dream about her.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.228
She was stood at the bus stop, crying.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.032
I... I asked her what was wrong,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.801
but she wouldn't say.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.003
I looked down the road,

05:36.136 --> 05:37.405
and when I turned back,
she'd gone.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.210
We have dreams for a reason.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.588
- Miss Yates?
- That's me.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.591
- Thanks for coming.
- I am DC Hodges.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.660
Er, we need to talk to your boys
about what they saw.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.696
It might be better
if you just spoke to us.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.831
And you are?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.133
Dr Hunter
from the village surgery.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.935
We need them to show us
what they found.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.572
No, er... no, they're not going
back to the woods.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.306
I know where
they're talking about.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.443
I'll take them.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.778
Thank you.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.781
You wanna follow me?

06:47.107 --> 06:48.308
You got any kids of your own?

06:48.442 --> 06:49.877
No.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.314
They all get a bit silly
when they go back to school.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.917
It's probably just
a deer carcass or something.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.689
Right, this is it.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.991
Path bears round to the left,
and that's Willow Hole.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.261
- Aren't you coming with us?
- No.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.907
<i>Within four minutes
of death,</i>

07:20.040 --> 07:22.810
<i>the human body starts
to decompose.</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:24.411
<i>The beginning
of a transformation</i>

07:24.545 --> 07:27.981
<i>that continues long after
the heart has stopped.</i>

07:28.115 --> 07:31.018
<i>As putrefaction causes
the body's own bacteria</i>

07:31.151 --> 07:32.720
<i>to destroy itself,</i>

07:32.853 --> 07:34.287
<i>nutrients are released,</i>

07:34.421 --> 07:37.891
<i>becoming a feast for
a multitude of other organisms.</i>

07:50.303 --> 07:53.741
<i>In this way, death,
far from being the end,</i>

07:53.874 --> 07:55.876
<i>is in fact a new beginning.</i>

07:57.511 --> 08:00.881
<i>The past not so much forgotten
as hidden,</i>

08:01.014 --> 08:02.916
<i>as scattered patterns
and successions</i>

08:03.050 --> 08:05.318
<i>that death imparts
now become essential clues</i>

08:05.452 --> 08:07.955
<i>to understanding
the final moments of life.</i>

08:42.054 --> 08:43.123
Hello?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.325
Sally?

08:47.995 --> 08:49.162
It's David.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.634
Sally?

08:58.071 --> 08:59.106
It's David.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.499
How long since
you last saw Miss Palmer?

10:01.168 --> 10:01.969
Er...

10:02.102 --> 10:04.304
Roughly will suffice.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.040
A couple of weeks ago
there was a...

10:07.174 --> 10:09.542
a barbecue at the Black Lamb,
a pub in the village.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.011
And she was with you?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.213
No. But we spoke.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.183
And after not seeing her
since then,

10:16.316 --> 10:18.485
you just decide to come here
today?

10:18.618 --> 10:19.853
Yeah, no, I was nearby.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.355
I-I just took your officers
to Farnham Woods.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.357
Yeah, I know.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.460
- Did you not try calling her?
- No.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.496
What's your relationship?

10:29.629 --> 10:33.033
Er... friends, I suppose.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.303
Did she have any family?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.106
No children, erm...

10:39.239 --> 10:41.174
No family locally
that I know of.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.442
Hmm.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.111
Any other boyfriends?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.312
I wasn't her boyfriend.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.347
Honestly, I...

10:47.480 --> 10:48.916
I don't know her that well.

10:49.049 --> 10:52.452
Just well enough
to let yourself into her house.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.658
Okay, well...

11:00.127 --> 11:01.328
that will do for now.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.530
How can I get hold of you?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.532
Manham Village Surgery.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.168
Okay.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.770
Alright, thank you.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.454
Sorry I'm late.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.490
I'm not aware that it's a crime.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.092
Yet.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.960
Is it?

12:07.094 --> 12:09.362
Janice, you're a wonder.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.099
I may have to cancel
your sabbatical.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.102
And by the way, David,
I took care of your 12:30.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.603
Suspected appendicitis,

12:16.736 --> 12:18.571
but I sent her off to A
- Sorry.

12:18.705 --> 12:19.940
- ...as a precaution.
- Thank you.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.275
David, you look
as if you've seen a ghost.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.214
Not me, erm...

12:27.347 --> 12:29.582
Sam and- and Neil Yates

12:29.716 --> 12:32.652
thought they'd found an angel

12:32.786 --> 12:34.221
in Farnham Woods.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.192
I, erm, I think it was
a dead body.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.360
Oh, sweet Jesus.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.230
Well, how are they, the boys?

12:43.363 --> 12:44.998
Shocked.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.034
Taking it in.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.768
I'll check on them tomorrow.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.972
My god.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.241
Have they got any idea who?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.176
Well...

12:56.309 --> 13:01.281
Linda was worried
about Sally Palmer. I...

13:01.414 --> 13:03.050
dropped in to her house.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.518
Something's not- not right, erm...

13:05.652 --> 13:08.588
There was a smashed mug
on the floor, a...

13:08.721 --> 13:11.324
half-written letter to Linda.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.496
We'll see. I...

13:16.629 --> 13:18.731
Awful. Not in Manham.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.236
I'll, er, leave the notes
in your office.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.437
I'll put
that phone call in.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.805
By the way, David,

13:25.939 --> 13:28.175
if you are dropping in
on those boys again,

13:28.308 --> 13:29.442
tread carefully.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.179
I've known Linda and Gary
longer than you.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.582
Gary's calmed down a bit,
but still.

13:35.715 --> 13:36.950
I'm just doing my job.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.652
All the same,
it's you I'm worried about.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.021
I'll be fine.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.189
I got your message.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.590
Tomorrow 4pm for George Mason.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.825
David.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.295
You know where I am.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.229
Thanks.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.779
Nice.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.392
I think this actually fits very
good to your picture, right?

14:54.361 --> 14:55.695
Yeah, it's good.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.299
Miss Jenny, Miss Jenny!

15:00.800 --> 15:02.435
Neil?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.736
Neil?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.807
Neil, can you hear me?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.309
Neil?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.164
They've had
the bloody bitterns' eggs.

15:31.298 --> 15:31.898
No.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.868
The bastards cut through
three bloody fences.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.304
I need you to hold the fort

15:37.437 --> 15:39.472
and chase up those funding
applications, would you?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.940
What are you gonna do?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.145
Less you know about that,
the better.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.680
The Wi-Fi's down again.
Will you take a look at that?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.185
Dan, get that loaded up, eh?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.386
Yeah.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.184
You okay?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.452
Yeah.

16:30.757 --> 16:31.624
Hi.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.725
Thank you for coming so quickly.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.461
Of course.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.728
So, this is Neil.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.230
He fainted.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.431
Hello again.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.600
How you doing?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.735
I'm fine. I'm okay.

16:42.869 --> 16:43.870
Yeah?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.438
Did something happen?

16:45.572 --> 16:48.308
Was- was something said, or...?

16:48.441 --> 16:51.478
Like I told Miss Krause,
I'm alright.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.480
Good. Can I check your pulse?

16:53.613 --> 16:54.681
Thank you.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.785
So, how did Norwich
get on last week?

16:58.918 --> 16:59.852
I'm Ipswich.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.854
Oh, sorry. Ipswich.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.991
They got turned over
by QPR.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.693
Neil's a top player.

17:06.826 --> 17:07.794
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.829
What position?

17:09.962 --> 17:11.931
Thinking... striker?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.500
Midfield.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.402
It's the strikers
that get all the goals,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.738
but midfield's
the most important position.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.939
Right.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.773
I think you're match fit,
young man.

17:21.907 --> 17:22.974
You're gonna be alright.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.911
Erm, are the parents on the way?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.413
- His father.
- Okay.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.013
Do you just wanna wait here
for a couple of minutes?

17:28.147 --> 17:30.383
We're gonna have
a quick chat outside, okay?

17:30.517 --> 17:31.751
Good lad.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.824
We're keeping an extra eye out.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.460
Good. And how's, er,
how's little Sam?

17:40.593 --> 17:41.461
He's okay.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.795
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:42.929 --> 17:45.532
But this must be shocking
for everyone.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.335
I'm a relative stranger
in Manham.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.736
It's only my second term.

17:49.869 --> 17:50.970
Where's Neil?

17:51.104 --> 17:52.339
Er, he's in here.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.640
They never should've
been in school today.

17:53.773 --> 17:54.841
Come on, boy. We're off.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.676
Sam, you alright?

17:56.809 --> 17:58.311
Taking 'em fishing.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.512
Okay.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.013
Goodbye.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.385
Actually a really good idea.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.953
Yeah, fishing.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.722
Is that medical advice
if the head asks?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.724
Yeah. I don't see why not.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.496
I was, erm... hoping for a word.

18:50.897 --> 18:51.998
Okay.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.275
- Come in.
- Thank you.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.744
Nice place.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.015
It's a lovely village, Manham.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.617
Bit of a change from London.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.052
Yeah, yeah.

19:13.186 --> 19:17.023
So, I, erm, did a spot
of research after our chat.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.891
You've got quite the CV,
Dr Hunter.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.693
Very impressive.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.631
Let's see.
Er, after your medical degree,

19:24.764 --> 19:28.034
you switched to a PhD
in forensic anthropology,

19:28.167 --> 19:29.402
followed by a stint

19:29.536 --> 19:31.971
at the University of Tennessee
Body Farm.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.807
Quite the high flyer.

19:34.941 --> 19:39.412
"The Role of Entomology
in Time-Since-Death Analysis."

19:39.546 --> 19:42.014
"The Chemistry
of Human Decomposition."

19:45.084 --> 19:46.619
Yeah.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.388
I wrote those.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.723
And yet here you are out here,

19:50.857 --> 19:52.825
pretending to be
a country doctor.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.299
I can't help wonder
why you didn't mention it.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.604
There's, erm...

20:04.737 --> 20:06.673
lots of other forensic anthropologists.

20:06.806 --> 20:07.840
I can give you numbers.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.909
Yes, but you're here now.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.044
We checked phone records.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.513
Sally Palmer didn't text

20:13.646 --> 20:15.715
or make outgoing calls
since the barbecue.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.285
Without confirmation, I'm stuck.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.490
- DNA?
- A week to process.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.191
- Fingerprints?
- No skin left.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.026
Next of kin?

20:27.159 --> 20:29.562
She has a brother
we're trying to locate.

20:29.696 --> 20:33.032
Look, time since death
would be a great start.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.734
Seemingly, you're not
just a specialist

20:34.867 --> 20:38.471
in human decomposition,
you are the specialist.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.440
Please, I need you to
take a look.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.509
It-it-it was another life.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.045
I'm sorry. I-I can't.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.384
Okay, well, I'll, erm...

20:52.819 --> 20:54.321
I'll leave you
my personal mobile.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.759
And you can call me any time.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.396
Day or night.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.669
Thanks.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.126
Thank you, Andrew.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.261
I'll get these.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.063
Nice one, mate.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.731
Cheers.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.034
Do you mind if we, er,
grab a seat?

21:42.168 --> 21:44.236
Twisted my bastard knee
chasing poachers last night.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.973
- It's open season out there.
- You want me to take a look?

21:47.106 --> 21:48.675
Nah, it's not that bad.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.177
Besides, they'll be the ones
needing you if I catch 'em.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.912
You talking to anyone
in particular, bud?

21:53.045 --> 21:54.647
What's that, Shane?

21:54.781 --> 21:56.148
Mind your own business.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.951
- Anyone...
- Alright, Tina?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.787
- Alright?
- Mind if we squeeze in?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.154
If you've showered.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.890
He has, for both of us.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.862
Hi.

22:09.996 --> 22:10.997
- Hi.
- Doc.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.732
- You wanna...
- No, thanks.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.801
Who's that?

22:14.934 --> 22:16.569
Journalist from Norwich. Kamal.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.771
He's been buying enough drinks.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.873
Bloody Brenners, getting their
side of the story in first.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.308
Relax, mate.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.743
You know how hard it is

22:23.876 --> 22:25.745
to get a breeding pair
of bitterns established.

22:25.878 --> 22:26.946
Can you play darts?

22:27.079 --> 22:28.815
Not really, no.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.050
Great. I might beat someone.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.120
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.822
- Good luck.
- Alright.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.561
- Ah.
- Almost.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.229
You sure you don't want me
to explain the rules again?

22:43.362 --> 22:44.864
No, I think you'll find
I'm getting better.

22:44.997 --> 22:45.998
Oh.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.700
Oh, my app guilts me

22:47.834 --> 22:50.036
when I drink more
than a couple of pints.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.871
- Diabetic?
- Yeah.

22:52.004 --> 22:52.905
Type one.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.306
I'm stable, but... oh.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.042
- No, I've got it.
- Okay.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.445
But I'm rubbish
at wearing my bracelet.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.347
Okay...

23:06.018 --> 23:06.786
Nice.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.821
Wow.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.696
This is so mad.

23:16.829 --> 23:17.930
A body's been found

23:18.064 --> 23:20.600
and no one in here's
talking about it.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.168
Yeah.
It's an English speciality.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.270
We like to bury our head
in the sand.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.972
That's why everyone's
here tonight.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.006
To ignore it?

23:27.139 --> 23:28.908
Pretty much.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.477
I can see that.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.747
The not knowing hits hardest.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.784
Like, who is it, how they died.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.318
Was it a murder?

23:39.452 --> 23:41.921
Yeah. Let's hope the police
have some answers soon.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.256
Yes. The village
really needs to know.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.107
Come on, lads.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.274
Come on then!

24:02.408 --> 24:03.776
Come on, mate. Come on.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.912
You're okay, mate. You're okay.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.780
It's okay, it's alright.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.216
You're okay. You're okay.
Put that camera away.

24:10.349 --> 24:11.718
You're alright.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.855
Jesus.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.924
This village is like
a pressure cooker.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.359
Yeah.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.898
<i>Mackenzie.</i>

24:59.031 --> 25:00.232
Hi, it's David.

25:01.901 --> 25:02.902
Where's the body?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.904
<i>It's at the lab.</i>

25:05.037 --> 25:07.406
<i>She was moved lunchtime.
I can meet you there if you...</i>

25:07.540 --> 25:09.275
No, I don't wanna see it.

25:09.408 --> 25:12.344
I'll look where she was found,
give my opinion, that's it.

25:13.412 --> 25:15.247
<i>Okay. I'll see you at nine.</i>

25:41.540 --> 25:45.311
<i>Soon after death,
a body begins to digest itself.</i>

25:45.444 --> 25:48.981
<i>Cell walls break down,
enzymes are released,</i>

25:49.115 --> 25:51.984
<i>and bacteria from the gut
surges around the body,</i>

25:52.118 --> 25:53.519
<i>even into the bones.</i>

25:53.653 --> 25:55.922
<i>Eggs are laid and larvae hatch</i>

25:56.055 --> 25:58.490
<i>to feed on the nutrient-rich
broth at their disposal,</i>

25:58.625 --> 26:00.793
<i>whilst insect predators arrive</i>

26:00.927 --> 26:02.494
<i>to consume the larvae themselves.</i>

26:13.606 --> 26:17.376
David.
Dr Hunter.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.847
This is Dr Shah,
a forensic pathologist.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.481
Dr Shah, Dr Hunter.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.816
Hi.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.384
How do you do, Dr Hunter?

26:26.385 --> 26:28.554
We've sent feathers
to an ornithologist.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.089
Good. Soil samples?

26:30.222 --> 26:32.124
- Already being analysed.
- Insects?

26:32.258 --> 26:34.894
Samples have been sent
to our forensic entomologist.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.295
- Any maggot pupae?
- Yes.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.297
Any empty shells?
Any beetles on the body?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.466
- Beetles were not noted.
- And the maggots?

26:40.599 --> 26:43.435
Maggots were noted,
but not their colouring.

26:43.569 --> 26:46.138
What have we got here?
Blowfly mainly.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.540
Bluebottles, greenbottles.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.009
If death occurred in daylight,

26:50.142 --> 26:52.344
they'd have started laying eggs
within the hour.

26:53.379 --> 26:56.548
The longer a maggot lives,
the darker it gets.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.851
This is seven,
maybe eight days old.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.153
Starting to pupate.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.489
I'm not seeing any empty shells,
so nothing's hatched yet.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.124
Lifecycle of fourteen days,

27:05.257 --> 27:07.559
but heat could shorten
certain stages.

27:07.694 --> 27:08.928
By how much?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.963
There's a few variables
to consider.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.232
But from what I'm seeing,
I'd suggest

27:13.365 --> 27:15.968
we've got a provisional
time since death interval

27:16.102 --> 27:18.170
of nine, maybe ten days.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.782
Bag, please.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.484
Thank you.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.265
You wanted fingerprints.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.135
Just add water.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.208
<i>The body is an archive,</i>

27:56.342 --> 27:58.878
<i>recording information
about who we are,</i>

27:59.011 --> 28:02.181
<i>what we did,
and what was done to us.</i>

28:02.314 --> 28:04.350
<i>The challenge
for the forensic anthropologist</i>

28:04.483 --> 28:06.385
<i>is to correctly read
this archive,</i>

28:06.518 --> 28:08.120
<i>looking at the morphology,</i>

28:08.254 --> 28:10.589
<i>chemistry and structure
of what remains,</i>

28:10.723 --> 28:13.625
<i>and interpret
the facts of life and death,</i>

28:13.760 --> 28:16.062
<i>and the journey
from one to another.</i>

28:22.802 --> 28:24.403
<i>Helen!</i>

28:24.536 --> 28:25.938
Good?

28:26.072 --> 28:27.539
Yeah. Yeah.

28:27.673 --> 28:28.674
I hope that was useful.

28:28.808 --> 28:31.510
That- that's all I can do.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.115
You were with Sally Palmer
at the barbecue?

28:36.248 --> 28:37.950
Yeah.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.119
Along with most of the village.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.453
What's your point?

28:45.758 --> 28:49.361
Some photos from the barbecue.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.163
Who's that with Linda Yates?

28:51.297 --> 28:54.333
Is this a formal police
interview?

28:54.466 --> 28:56.168
It's just a few questions.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.437
Okay.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.639
That's Ben... Anders.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.441
Er, manages the nature reserve.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.543
She works there part-time,
I think.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.278
Near where the body was found?

29:06.412 --> 29:07.980
Half a mile, maybe.

29:08.114 --> 29:12.018
That's obviously Linda Yates
and... and Sally.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.452
They seem like good friends?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.222
I don't know.

29:17.790 --> 29:20.359
That's Dr Maitland, Henry.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.494
Has he always been in a chair?

29:22.628 --> 29:23.729
Road accident.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.397
That's how I first came here
as locum,

29:25.531 --> 29:27.633
then as partner when he found
out he wouldn't walk again.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.702
He... lost his wife
in the accident.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.605
So, what do I call you, anyway?

29:33.739 --> 29:35.808
David? Dr Hunter?

29:37.409 --> 29:40.712
I hope you don't have to call me
too much, but David is fine.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.078
Hi.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.412
- You alright?
- Yeah.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.214
- Do you want a lift?
- No, no, you're alright.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.083
It's out of your way.
- No, it's fine.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.350
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.718
Thank you.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.220
Yeah.

30:21.353 --> 30:22.721
Just throw 'em in.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.192
- Thank you.
- No worries.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.761
- How are the boys?
- They're alright.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.763
A bit quiet.

30:31.898 --> 30:34.300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:40.172 --> 30:44.243
So, if it's okay to ask,
was it Sally?

30:45.344 --> 30:48.614
Police matter, I'm afraid.
I... can't say.

30:51.918 --> 30:55.721
I know the police are meant to
be reassuring, but they aren't.

30:57.823 --> 31:00.159
You mentioned
your dream about her.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.361
Yeah. I don't know, er...

31:02.494 --> 31:05.064
She must've been on my mind,
and that's how it came out.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.532
I hadn't heard from her.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.467
I thought
I'd done something wrong.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.703
If she was going away,
she always said.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.742
All I had to do was call,
but I didn't.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.511
I'm stupid sometimes.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.665
Hey!

31:41.267 --> 31:42.268
- I said...
- What?

31:42.401 --> 31:45.237
Cut it straight, in lines!

31:45.371 --> 31:46.638
- Sorry.
- Do as I bloody tell you.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.474
Alright.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.510
I think Sally was trying
to find something out.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.479
But maybe I got it wrong.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.883
She made everyone brave.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.586
She made me brave.

32:05.691 --> 32:06.925
Where you been?

32:08.527 --> 32:09.996
Shopping.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.337
Hi, Gary.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.671
Heavy bags.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.143
Thank you.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.544
No worries.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.908
Yeah, go on. You'll do.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.710
Don't sound so surprised.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.713
Yeah, but George,

33:34.846 --> 33:37.516
I need you to get used
to Dr. Hunter here.

33:37.649 --> 33:38.750
Not going anywhere, are you?

33:38.884 --> 33:40.252
No, no, no, no.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.455
But we do try
and share the work, eh.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.892
He doesn't bite, and he is
a real doctor, you know?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.627
It's no skin off my nose.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.862
I'll be in my box soon enough.

33:50.996 --> 33:53.532
Not if we can help it, George.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.567
You mind if I take a look
at the ankle?

33:59.905 --> 34:01.140
Pop your foot up.

34:02.574 --> 34:03.842
May I...?

34:06.912 --> 34:09.681
- Who did this dressing?
- The grandson.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.717
Yeah, it's a nice job, but...

34:11.850 --> 34:13.418
maybe let the nurse in
next time.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.920
Give that grandson of yours
a rest.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.965
- Hey.
- Morning.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.567
Is he here?

34:28.699 --> 34:30.436
- He's waiting.
- Okay.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.705
- See you.
- Yeah.

34:47.052 --> 34:49.288
I wish I could draw like you.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.621
Just practice, yeah?

34:55.025 --> 34:58.564
How about that one, over there?

34:59.698 --> 35:01.433
That's a shoveler, yeah.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.570
Come autumn, the male
will have two white marks

35:04.703 --> 35:06.505
one each side of his face.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.773
Really?

35:08.774 --> 35:10.041
I didn't know that.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.843
Yeah.

35:11.977 --> 35:13.812
There's not many who do.

35:17.015 --> 35:19.751
How about you try
and write the word up...

35:19.885 --> 35:22.554
Yeah, no, I can't do that.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.055
Just practice, Dan.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.057
Come on!

35:32.164 --> 35:33.765
(shouting) What the hell
are we meant to eat?!

35:33.899 --> 35:35.801
Look in the fridge!
You know what time I -

35:35.934 --> 35:38.504
(shouting) Oh, yeah,
every fucking night!

35:39.638 --> 35:41.540
Exactly!

35:41.673 --> 35:44.843
You always were a fucking bitch!

36:32.224 --> 36:34.626
- Sally?
- No, Linda Yates is missing.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.795
She didn't show up
to work this morning.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.564
Ben Anders made the report.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.065
We've established
that she left her house

36:40.198 --> 36:42.534
yesterday evening,
but she didn't return home.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.603
I gave her a lift yesterday.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.805
- Yeah, we got it on CCTV.
- Her bags were heavy.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.774
What was her state of mind?

36:49.641 --> 36:50.742
She was anxious.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.778
She was talking about Sally.

36:52.911 --> 36:53.912
Erm...

36:55.113 --> 36:56.682
- She seemed frightened.
- Of Gary?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.183
I wondered.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.786
Look, I want you on the search.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.888
You know these people.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.161
Does she always run alone?

37:10.296 --> 37:12.464
Yep. And she liked to keep fit.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.732
Liked?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.668
That's what I said.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.004
She also ran to work
at the nature reserve

37:19.137 --> 37:20.606
each morning, correct?

37:20.739 --> 37:23.842
Yeah, twice the distance by road
and petrol what it costs...

37:25.311 --> 37:27.879
And her evening run,
was that a-a regular thing?

37:28.013 --> 37:30.849
Oh, she's always bloody training.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.452
So, who knew
apart from yourself?

37:33.585 --> 37:34.986
How the heck should I know?

37:35.120 --> 37:36.288
Probably half the village.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.889
I'm sorry to be
putting you through this,

37:38.023 --> 37:39.625
but we're asking everyone
the same questions.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.360
Where were you
the remainder of the evening?

37:42.694 --> 37:44.162
At home with the boys.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.564
Where else was I gonna be?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.799
Did you try and call Linda?

37:47.933 --> 37:49.735
Several times.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.169
You can check my phone.

37:51.303 --> 37:52.738
Tried her mum and all.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.541
Why not report her missing
last night?

37:55.674 --> 37:56.908
I thought she went out
to clear her head.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.677
Why would she need to do that?

37:59.678 --> 38:01.647
We're like any other couple.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.682
Sometimes there's
a difference of opinion.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.585
And has she stayed out
all night before?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.253
Once or twice.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.789
Where did she go then?

38:12.190 --> 38:13.692
Sally Palmer's.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.798
Why did you wait for Anders to
let us know Linda was missing?

38:22.401 --> 38:26.838
You might wanna ask yourself,
why didn't he call me first?

38:26.972 --> 38:29.140
You'll have to be
more specific, Mr Yates.

38:29.274 --> 38:31.710
Well, you're the detectives.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.244
I reckon she's fine.

38:33.379 --> 38:36.147
Just someone playing games.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.286
Is there anywhere else
she may have gone to?

38:43.321 --> 38:45.290
Besides Anders's place...

38:46.324 --> 38:48.093
No.

38:48.226 --> 38:49.861
Not that I can think of.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.109
You alright?

39:05.377 --> 39:08.914
You think this is a good idea,
using most of the village?

39:09.047 --> 39:11.016
No, I don't.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.051
But the profiler thinks
the killer might struggle

39:13.184 --> 39:14.486
to stay away, so...

39:15.921 --> 39:17.022
Right.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.825
Okay, listen up, people.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.928
Thank you all for coming. Erm...

39:23.061 --> 39:24.830
We'll be moving east to west,

39:24.963 --> 39:26.998
no more than three metres apart.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.868
I need you to stop on call
and wait to proceed.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.670
Please, no broken lines.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.071
We've got nine hours
till sunset.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.305
Let's use them all.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.924
What makes you
think she was coming to you?

39:53.058 --> 39:54.993
Place of safety.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.228
The state she was in
some mornings.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.999
Were you and Linda Yates lovers?

40:03.134 --> 40:04.636
No comment.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.137
Did Gary know?

40:06.271 --> 40:08.239
Couldn't tell you
what Gary knows.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.410
How well did you know
Sally Palmer?

40:13.479 --> 40:14.813
Well enough.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.059
That way.

40:30.328 --> 40:31.229
Oh, geez.

40:31.362 --> 40:32.798
Sorry, mate. Okay.

40:34.365 --> 40:35.734
Some first aid, er...

40:36.902 --> 40:38.436
- Trap.
- Everyone stop!

40:38.570 --> 40:41.006
- There are more traps out here.
- Alright, alright, alright.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.273
- On three, alright?
- Yeah.

40:42.407 --> 40:43.975
One, two, three.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.013
Alright, Robert, deep breaths, okay?

40:48.146 --> 40:49.280
We need an ambulance, please!

40:49.414 --> 40:51.717
Have you seen anything
like this before?

40:51.850 --> 40:53.184
Poachers.

40:53.318 --> 40:54.720
Brenners, most likely.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.354
What, you don't use these?

40:56.488 --> 40:57.422
No.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.459
Okay. Gonna be alright.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.142
I need you to look at the body.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.881
I don't care what happened
in your past. This is now.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.784
A woman is missing,
a woman you know.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.086
You've got the skills
and you're here.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.231
<i>Helen!</i>

42:05.390 --> 42:07.458
Dr Hunter?

42:08.627 --> 42:12.330
Let's, er,
start with what we know.

42:13.231 --> 42:14.365
Are you alright?

42:16.101 --> 42:17.468
Let's begin, please.

42:20.138 --> 42:25.443
Well, the most probable cause
of death is the throat wound.

42:25.577 --> 42:28.847
The angle of the incision
would suggest right-handed.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.181
Mm-hmm.

42:30.315 --> 42:31.750
There is a head injury,

42:31.883 --> 42:35.921
which the post-mortem
couldn't entirely rule out.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.956
Possibly caused by a fall.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.926
She was still alive
when her throat was cut.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.294
How can you know that?

42:43.428 --> 42:45.931
Body's prematurely desiccated.

42:46.932 --> 42:49.367
Couldn't that be
due to the hot weather?

42:51.136 --> 42:54.005
Hmm, even in this heat, the body
wouldn't dry out so quickly

42:54.139 --> 42:55.607
without considerable blood loss.

42:57.275 --> 42:58.910
You checked the soil
for iron levels, right?

42:59.044 --> 43:01.112
Yes. We're waiting for results.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.380
Okay.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.984
<i>Even in death
there is intimacy in touch.</i>

43:06.117 --> 43:08.053
<i>The body whispering
essential clues</i>

43:08.186 --> 43:09.988
<i>to the manner of their demise.</i>

43:10.121 --> 43:12.057
<i>Yet though there can
be no consent,</i>

43:12.190 --> 43:15.393
<i>it remains
a necessary intrusion,</i>

43:15.526 --> 43:17.462
<i>for even the dead
deserve justice.</i>

43:46.324 --> 43:47.859
Hmm.

43:47.993 --> 43:49.828
What is it?

43:49.961 --> 43:55.000
You-you see the way
the... flesh is torn?

43:55.133 --> 43:56.134
Here.

43:56.267 --> 43:57.869
So, a serrated knife was used.

43:58.003 --> 43:59.370
At least partially.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.407
Possibly a hunting knife.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.142
Well, there's no sign
the knife wobbled,

44:04.275 --> 44:07.312
so yes, a hunting knife
would've been my thought too.

44:07.445 --> 44:12.050
Except the wound to the throat
is smooth-edged.

44:14.385 --> 44:15.586
So, a different knife?

44:15.721 --> 44:18.223
Yeah, two different knives.

44:33.471 --> 44:35.140
See the angle
of the sutures?

44:35.273 --> 44:36.441
Hmm.

44:36.574 --> 44:38.343
45 degrees.
What does that mean?

44:38.476 --> 44:40.511
He or she would have been
left-handed.

44:40.645 --> 44:44.115
Exactly.
Not just two different knives.

44:44.249 --> 44:46.084
Two different people.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.356
Let's move!

44:51.489 --> 44:53.224
They've caught the scent!
Let's move!

44:54.625 --> 44:56.427
Over there, to the left!

44:56.561 --> 44:58.329
Good boy, go on, find it!
