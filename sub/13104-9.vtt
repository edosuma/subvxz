00:02.170 --> 00:04.320
(siren wailing in distance)

00:05.300 --> 00:06.961
(lock clicks)

00:07.000 --> 00:08.297
GAIL?

00:10.770 --> 00:12.328
YOU HOME?

00:12.380 --> 00:13.836
(lock clicks)

00:15.480 --> 00:18.608
HEY, REMEMBER
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:18.650 --> 00:23.713
COMPLETELY UNCOOL TO WALK AROUND
NAKED IN SOMEONE ELSE'S PLACE.

00:26.290 --> 00:27.814
GAIL?

00:27.860 --> 00:30.681
HEY.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.027
OH.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.426
(both grunting)

00:34.460 --> 00:38.089
AAH!

00:38.130 --> 00:39.438
(groans)

00:39.470 --> 00:42.462
(panﬁng)

00:51.880 --> 00:53.814
(siren wailing)

00:53.850 --> 00:55.772
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

00:55.820 --> 00:56.787
(typing on keyboard)
HEY.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.583
HEY.
(mug clatters)

00:58.620 --> 01:00.679
MMM. CHECK THIS OUT.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.154
(coffee pours)

01:03.190 --> 01:04.885
OH, I THOUGHT YOU PASSED
THIS CASE OFF

01:04.930 --> 01:06.090
TO HOMICIDE SQUAD
LAST NIGHT.

01:06.130 --> 01:07.859
OOH. SORRY. WRONG FILE.

01:07.900 --> 01:08.992
OH.

01:09.030 --> 01:11.169
(chuckles)

01:11.200 --> 01:12.337
WHAT'S THIS?

01:12.370 --> 01:14.588
THAT'S OUR FUTURE.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.165
I FIGURED AFI'ER WE GET MARRIED,
WE'RE GONNA NEED A NEW PLACE.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.302
(gasps)

01:18.340 --> 01:20.808
SO I HAVE BEEN LOOKING.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.401
AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO LIVE
NEAR THE DOWNTOWN.

01:24.450 --> 01:27.510
SO ALL THESE HOUSES ARE
A 10-MINUTE DRIVE

01:27.550 --> 01:30.781
FROM CITY CENTER, AND THEY'RE
IN GOOD NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:30.820 --> 01:33.983
TREE-LIN ED STREETS,
GOOD SCHOOLS.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.908
THEY ALL HAVE FOUR BEDROOMS.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.825
YEAH. ONE FOR US,

01:37.860 --> 01:40.124
AND THERE'S ONE FOR LEO,
AND THERE'S THE OFFICE,

01:40.160 --> 01:43.197
AND THE OTHER ONE COULD BE
FOR, UM...

01:43.230 --> 01:45.198
A NURSERY.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.039
(groans) JERRY.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.459
I KNOW. I KNOW. I'M NOT--
I'M NOT SAYING TOMORROW.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.364
JUST SOMEDAY.

01:51.410 --> 01:52.968
IF--IF WE WANT.

01:53.010 --> 01:55.934
WHAT I WANT IS
TO BE A GOOD MOM

01:55.980 --> 01:57.607
TO THE CHILD
THAT I ALREADY HAVE...

01:57.650 --> 01:58.901
MM-HMM.

01:58.950 --> 02:02.886
AND TO DO MY BEST AT THE JOB
THAT I JUST BARELY STARTED.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.788
AND ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.058
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:11.090 --> 02:13.456
WE GOT A LOT OF TIME
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:15.030 --> 02:16.497
OR NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

02:16.530 --> 02:18.395
I MEAN, ACTUALLY, I QUITE
LIKE IT WHEN WE DON'T TALK.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.159
ME, TOO.
REALLY?

02:30.080 --> 02:31.342
(indistinct conversations)

02:31.380 --> 02:33.177
OH, IS IT BRIGHT IN HERE,

02:33.220 --> 02:35.040
OR AM I BEING BLINDED

02:35.080 --> 02:38.618
BY THE RADIANT GLOW
OF OUR MAMA-TO-BE?

02:38.650 --> 02:42.325
WHAT THE HELL COLOR IS
MORNING CHARTREUSE?

02:42.360 --> 02:45.488
THAT IS AWESOME.
UH, I LOVE THIS ONE.

02:45.530 --> 02:48.590
IT'S, UH, YELLOWISH,
IN THE...

02:48.630 --> 02:50.461
IT'S IN THE YELLOW FAMILY.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.331
HMM.
IT'S NICE.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.031
YOU HAVEN'T PAINTED
THE BABY'S ROOM?

02:54.070 --> 02:56.209
OKAY,
I MAY LOOK LIKE A HOUSE,

02:56.240 --> 02:57.935
BUT I STILL HAVE
ANOTHER MONTH TO GO,

02:57.970 --> 02:59.870
WHICH IS GOOD
BECAUSE I OBVIOUSLY NEED

02:59.910 --> 03:01.730
ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS
TO PICK A DAMN COLOR!

03:01.780 --> 03:03.645
NO. NO. NO. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.307
THERE'S NO RUSH.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.341
YOU GOT THE NAME.
YOU GOT YOUR GO BAG.

03:07.380 --> 03:08.779
YOU'RE READY. YOU'RE READY.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.640
(whispers)
IT'S GOOD. YOU'RE GOOD.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.410
(normal voice) YOU'RE GOOD.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.552
HEY, BUDDY.

03:15.590 --> 03:16.727
BUDDY.

03:16.760 --> 03:17.749
(groans)

03:17.790 --> 03:19.826
SAM MY.
(pours coffee)

03:22.200 --> 03:23.963
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.766
WELL, A GROOM IS SUPPOSED TO GET
HIS BEST MAN A GIFT.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.960
SO IT'S A POCKET WATCH.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.160
AH.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.609
SO YOU CAN BE AT THE CHURCH
ON TIME.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.131
EXCEPT IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A CHURCH. IT'S GONNA BE A BEACH,

03:34.180 --> 03:37.206
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA GO
WITH YOUR MANKINI.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.206
YEAH. ALL RIGHT. AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET YOU SOMETHING?

03:39.250 --> 03:40.945
NO. NO. NO.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.845
YOU JUST GOTI'A BE THERE, BUD.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.415
YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT
I DON'T... (inhales deeply)

03:45.450 --> 03:47.657
MAKE TOO BIG OF A FOOL
OF MYSELF.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.089
SO I HAVE TO DO MAGIC?

03:49.120 --> 03:50.985
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.157
OH, AND APPARENTLY,
IT'S BAD LUCK

03:53.200 --> 03:55.191
TO, UH, GIVE A WATCH
AS A GIFT,

03:55.230 --> 03:57.221
SO IF YOU WANNA THROW ME,
LIKE, 5 OR 10 BUCKS,

03:57.270 --> 03:58.897
THEN TECHNICALLY,
IT'S NOT A GIFT.

03:58.930 --> 04:00.158
10 BUCKS?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.430
YEAH. OR YOU BUY ME A ROUND.
THEN WE'RE SQUARE.

04:02.470 --> 04:03.664
HERE YOU GO.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.961
THAT'S FUNNY.

04:05.010 --> 04:08.002
(police radio chatter)

04:10.610 --> 04:11.907
HEY, NASH.

04:11.950 --> 04:13.417
HAVE YOU SEEN MCNALLY?

04:13.450 --> 04:14.747
NO, NOT THIS MORNING.

04:14.780 --> 04:15.849
NO?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.711
OKAY, LISTEN UP.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.456
FOR THOSE OF YOU WEREN'T THERE
LAST NIGHT,

04:19.490 --> 04:20.912
LET ME BRING YOU UP TO SPEED.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.622
WE SENT OFFICER PECK UNDERCOVER
ON A MISSING PERSONS CASE

04:23.660 --> 04:27.050
ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT PERSON
WASN'T ACTUALLY MISSING.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.728
ON THE OTHER HAND,
OFFICER EPSTEIN AND DIAZ

04:29.770 --> 04:32.125
FOLLOWED UP ON A POTENTIALLY
RELATED COLD CASE,

04:32.170 --> 04:33.831
AND LATE LAST NIGHT,
FOUND THE BODY

04:33.870 --> 04:37.806
OF NICOLE MARSHALL
AT MOORE PARK.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.774
MARSHALL WAS A CALL GIRL

04:39.810 --> 04:41.778
THAT DID GO MISSING
A MONTH AGO.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.072
WHERE WE AT WITH IT?

04:43.110 --> 04:44.543
WE'RE NOT. I MEAN,
NOW THAT THERE'S A BODY,

04:44.580 --> 04:46.002
IT'S BEING HANDED OFF
TO HOMICIDE.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.449
HAVE YOU SEEN MCNALLY
THIS MORNING?

04:47.480 --> 04:48.640
NO.
NO?

04:48.680 --> 04:50.580
(beeps)

04:50.620 --> 04:53.612
(Frank speaking indistinctly)

04:57.090 --> 05:00.628
(telephone rings)

05:00.660 --> 05:04.494
(ﬁng)

05:04.530 --> 05:08.364
(ﬁng)

05:08.400 --> 05:12.336
(ﬁng)

05:12.380 --> 05:15.008
(ﬁng)

05:15.040 --> 05:16.132
HELLO?

05:16.180 --> 05:19.172
GOOD MORNING.
UH, I'M SURE YOU AND PECK

05:19.210 --> 05:21.041
were staying up late last night
painting each other's toenails,

05:21.080 --> 05:22.388
but you're supposed to be
at work.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.944
SAM.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.754
SAM, IT'S GAIL.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.723
(sirens wailing)

05:34.800 --> 05:36.563
(camera shutter clicks,
police radio chatter)

05:36.600 --> 05:38.227
HE MUST HAVE STUCK HER
WITH SOMETHING.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.135
SHE'S GOT A NEEDLE MARK
ON HER NECK.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.031
ANY DIZZINESS OR NAUSEA?

05:45.070 --> 05:47.379
NO. JUST A HEADACHE.

05:48.910 --> 05:51.777
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS, THE LAB
MAKES THIS TOP PRIORITY,

05:51.810 --> 05:53.038
SO EVERYTHING GETS COPIED

05:53.080 --> 05:54.616
TO HEADQUARTERS
AND ALL DIVISIONS. YEAH?

05:54.650 --> 05:56.584
AN DY, YOU OKAY?

05:56.620 --> 05:58.019
YEAH.

05:58.890 --> 06:01.381
MCNALLY, YOU ABLE
TO WALK THROUGH IT?

06:01.420 --> 06:05.254
YEAH, UM, I-I CAME HOME, UM...

06:06.960 --> 06:09.349
I-I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN,
YOU KNOW,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.561
LATER THAN TEN MINUTES
AFI'ER GAIL GOT HERE.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.693
BUT IT WAS DARK,

06:13.740 --> 06:15.799
AND THE LAMP WAS ON THE GROUND.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.138
GAIL WAS LYING RIGHT OVER THERE,

06:18.170 --> 06:20.001
AND WHEN I CHECKED HER,
WHEN I FLIPPED HER OVER,

06:20.040 --> 06:21.837
SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS,
SHE HAD, UH, BLOOD ON HER FACE,

06:21.880 --> 06:24.007
AND HER HANDS WERE ZIP-TIED.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.514
UM, THAT'S--THAT'S WHEN HE--

06:26.550 --> 06:29.018
HE GRABBED ME AND HE...

06:29.050 --> 06:32.019
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S ALL I CAN REMEMBER.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.153
DID YOU SEE HIS FACE?

06:33.190 --> 06:34.919
NOPE.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.848
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
HE WAS STRONGER THAN ME.

06:36.890 --> 06:38.027
HE WAS TALLER THAN ME.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.426
I MEAN,
I TRIED TO FIGHT HIM OFF.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.223
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT HE SHOT HER UP WITH?

06:42.260 --> 06:44.694
THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL
WITHOUT A BLOOD TEST.

06:44.730 --> 06:47.392
ALL RIGHT, ANDY, YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

06:47.440 --> 06:48.839
NO. NO.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.701
LISTEN, WE NEED
TO FOCUS ON GAIL.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.731
IF THE DRUG IS STILL
IN YOUR BLOOD, IT'S EVIDENCE.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.532
IT MIGHT BE THE FASTEST WAY
TO FIND HER.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.172
COME ON.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.848
LET'S GET YOU CHANGED.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.940
(exhales deeply, lowered voice)
HE CAME PREPARED,

07:04.990 --> 07:07.083
YOU KNOW, ZIP TIES,
SOME KIND OF SEDATIVE.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.917
MCNALLY MUST HAVE
SURPRISED HIM.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.985
SHE'S LUCKY
HE DIDN'T GRAB HER, TOO.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.327
(exhales deeply)

07:13.700 --> 07:15.349
(man) WHAT'S YOUR 20?

07:15.400 --> 07:17.664
(police radio chatter)

07:17.700 --> 07:19.463
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.195
PLEASE.
I-I GOTI'A GET IN THERE.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.832
DIAZ,
YOU GOTTA CALM DOWN, PAL.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.963
IT'S GAIL.
I KNOW. ALL THE MORE REASON

07:25.010 --> 07:26.773
NOT TO STORM IN THERE
AND CONTAMINATE THE SCENE.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.698
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS RIGHT,
OKAY?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.048
HOW'S AN DY?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.968
SHE'S OKAY. SAM IS WITH HER.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.773
(sirens whoop)

07:33.820 --> 07:35.776
CANVASSED THE NEIGHBORS.
NO ONE SAW ANYTHING.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.708
ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU KEEP CANVASSING.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.445
NEXT BLOCK, BLOCK AFTER THAT.
YOU TALK TO EVERYBODY.

07:39.490 --> 07:41.287
NO DETAIL IS TOO SMALL.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.821
ALL RIGHT? KEEP IT TOGETHER.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.259
ALL RIGHT?

07:44.290 --> 07:46.155
ON IT.

07:46.190 --> 07:49.125
COME ON, PEOPLE.
LET'S MOVE IT BACK.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.594
WRONG DAY TO PISS ME OFF.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.196
NOELLE,
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HERE.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.629
MISSING OFFICER.
WE ALL NEED TO BE HERE.

07:58.670 --> 08:01.207
WE GOT ANYTHING?

08:01.240 --> 08:04.368
FRANK, HER WHOLE FAMILY'S
POLICE. THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

08:04.410 --> 08:07.709
HER BROTHER'S IN DEEP COVER.
I'LL HAVE HIS HANDLER GET WORD.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.218
NO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.957
(sirens continue wailing)

08:12.990 --> 08:15.959
SIR, ANDY'S GIVEN
HER STATEMENT.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.685
I'M GOING WITH HER
TO MEMORIAL.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.823
LOOK, SIR, I'M REALLY SORRY.

08:19.860 --> 08:20.952
WHAT?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.353
I JUST SHOULD'VE FOUGHT HARDER.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.992
I MEAN, SHE WAS IN MY APARTMENT,
AND--

08:24.030 --> 08:26.567
MCNALLY. DON'T.
WE ARE GOING TO FIND HER.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.309
EVERY OFFICER IN THE CITY IS
GONNA BE ON THIS UNTIL WE DO.

08:30.340 --> 08:31.466
OKAY?

08:31.510 --> 08:32.579
NASH .
YEAH?

08:32.610 --> 08:34.305
WE'LL GO IN MY SQUAD CAR.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.740
HEY. A-ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU?

08:36.780 --> 08:38.839
YEAH.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.212
(siren wails)

08:47.220 --> 08:48.710
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

08:48.760 --> 08:51.228
OKAY, LOOK, LUKE CAUGHT
THE NICOLE MARSHALL CASE.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.989
IT'S THE SAME M.O. AS PECK.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.998
A BLONDE CALL GIRL
TAKEN FROM HER APARTMENT.

08:55.030 --> 08:56.622
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
THAT THEY'RE CONNECTED.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.625
CALLAGHAN.

08:57.670 --> 08:58.659
HOW LONG SHE BEEN GONE?

08:58.700 --> 09:01.066
MCNALLY SAW HER
JUST AFI'ER 2:00 AM.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.861
CORONER'S STILL WITH THE BODY,
BUT NICOLE MARSHALL HAD, UH,

09:04.910 --> 09:06.434
WOUNDS ON HER
THAT HAD STARTED TO HEAL.

09:06.470 --> 09:07.676
SO HE KEPT HER ALIVE?

09:07.710 --> 09:08.938
ABOUT 24 HOURS.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.403
OKAY, SO IT'S THE SAME GUY
WE'VE GOT.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.771
WE GOT 14 HOURS.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.072
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET MOVING.

09:27.130 --> 09:30.099
(breathing heavily)

09:30.130 --> 09:33.759
***

09:36.070 --> 09:39.335
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

09:39.370 --> 09:41.770
(exhales deeply)

09:41.810 --> 09:43.004
YOU OKAY?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.642
YEAH, I JUST GO'I'I'A SIT DOWN.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.841
I ALWAYS GOTTA SIT DOWN.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.916
SWOLLEN ANKLES. SORE BACK.

09:48.950 --> 09:50.679
HOW DID YOU HANDLE THIS?

09:50.720 --> 09:51.744
I WAS 17.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.189
RIGHT.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.381
HEY. UH, WHAT DID THEY SAY?

09:55.420 --> 09:58.526
UH, SOME KIND OF TRANQUILIZER.
UH, BLOOD'S GONE TO THE LAB.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.027
THEY SHOULD HAVE AN ANSWER
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.426
AND YOU?
I'M FINE. HOSPITAL CLEARED ME.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.428
I GUESS NOW WE JUST
HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.324
UH, YEAH. REALLY, I'M FINE.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.667
I'M GONNA GET BACK TO WORK.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.689
ANDY.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.800
LOOK, GAIL IS MISSING.
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.808
BLOOD WORK'S GONNA TAKE
A WHILE.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.105
I MEAN, IF I COULD GET UP,
I'D BE OUT THERE MYSELF.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.004
OKAY. FINE.
BUT LET ME CALL FOR A RELAY.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.779
I'LL HAVE A SQUAD CAR
MEET YOU OUTSIDE,

10:20.820 --> 10:22.139
TAKE YOU TO THE STATION.
ALL RIGHT.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.442
OKAY.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.185
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

10:25.220 --> 10:26.687
SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW,

10:26.720 --> 10:30.486
LAST NIGHT WE RAN A STING
OPERATION AT THE ARCHER HOTEL.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.192
OFFICER PECK WAS THE BAIT.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.788
JUST AFTER 2:00 A.M.,

10:34.830 --> 10:37.560
OFFICER MCNALLY AND PECK
WERE ASSAULTED

10:37.600 --> 10:39.989
AT MCNALLY'S HOME.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.268
PECK WAS ABDUCT ED.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.267
NO WITNESSES.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.666
SAME M.O.
AS NICOLE MARSHALL--

10:44.710 --> 10:46.598
BLONDE CALL GIRL LAST SEEN
AT THE ARCHER.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.335
OUR PRIME SUSPECT WAS

10:48.380 --> 10:51.076
THE SUBJECT
OF LAST NIGHT'S OPERATION.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.873
ONE CHARLES DAVIS, AGE 32,

10:52.920 --> 10:55.571
OWNER OF
A BIO SOFTWARE COMPANY,

10:55.620 --> 10:57.815
AND LAST KNOWN CLIENT
OF NICOLE MARSHALL.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.317
YOU BROUGHT THAT GUY IN
LAST NIGHT.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.419
YEAH, AND WE LET HIM GO

11:00.460 --> 11:02.280
ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE
PECK WENT MISSING.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.778
BUT IF YOU GRABBED HIM,
HE KNOWS GAIL'S POLICE.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.889
PREDATORS LIKE THAT
ARE ARROGANT.

11:07.930 --> 11:09.192
THE FACT THAT SHE'S A COP

11:09.230 --> 11:10.561
MIGHT MAKE IT
THAT MUCH MORE OF A THRILL.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.761
WE'RE WAITING FOR A WARRANT,

11:12.800 --> 11:15.997
AND DETECTIVE CALLAGHAN'S GONNA
BE HANDLING THE MARSHALL ANGLE.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.837
DIAZ, COLLINS,

11:17.870 --> 11:20.873
YOU HELP HIM OUT.
ANYTHING HE NEEDS.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.639
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.479
(Jerry) COLLINS.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.343
(indistinct conversations)

11:32.820 --> 11:35.414
WE RECOVERED PECK'S PHONE
AT THE SCENE,

11:35.460 --> 11:39.157
AND IT SHOWS 2 CALLS TO YOU
AT 1:46 AND 2:05.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.748
SO WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.825
SHE LEFT ME A COUPLE MESSAGES.
WANTED TO SEE ME.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.259
YOU DIDN'T GO SEE HER?

11:45.300 --> 11:48.895
ACTUALLY, UH, I DIDN'T CHECK
MY PHONE TILL THIS MORNING.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.568
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA NEED THE MESSAGES,

11:51.610 --> 11:53.237
'CAUSE WE GOTTA PUT A TIME LINE
TOGETHER FOR PECK.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.577
YES, SIR.
YEAH.

11:54.610 --> 11:56.373
ABSOLUTELY.

11:56.410 --> 11:57.707
GOOD.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.984
DETECTIVE CALLAGHAN,
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

12:03.020 --> 12:04.681
GRAB A BOX.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.984
I.D.E.N.T. HASN'T FOUND ANYTHING
OVER AT ANDY'S PLACE YET,

12:07.020 --> 12:08.817
BUT WE KNOW THIS GUY.
HE USED GLOVES,

12:08.860 --> 12:11.078
ZIP TIES,
SOME KIND OF SEDATIVE.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.428
GUY THIS ORGANIZED,
IT'S NOT HIS FIRST TIME.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.451
I WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH
THESE UNSOLVED CASES.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.865
LOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT POPS,

12:16.900 --> 12:19.892
SO ASSAULTS INVOLVING NEEDLES,
INJECTIONS, CALL GIRLS.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.589
SIR, HOW IS THAT GONNA HELP US
FIND GAIL?

12:21.640 --> 12:24.404
IT'S CALLED POLICE WORK,
OFFICER...

12:24.440 --> 12:25.862
COLLINS.
COLLINS.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.104
IF WE BRING IN
CHARLIE DAVIS,

12:27.140 --> 12:28.402
HE'S GOT GAIL
LOCKED UP SOMEWHERE,

12:28.440 --> 12:30.374
WE'RE GONNA NEED
ALL THE LEVERAGE WE CAN GET.

12:30.410 --> 12:33.811
THE MORE WE CAN TIE TO HIM,
BETTER CHANCE WE HAVE.

12:33.850 --> 12:36.171
YOU GUYS ALREADY
HAD TO LET HIM GO ONCE.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.949
LET'S MAKE SURE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.983
ALL RIGHT.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.123
THIS WARRANT COVERS
ALL OF DAVIS' PROPERTIES.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.752
TEAM ONE, YOU'RE ON THE HOUSE.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.529
TEAM TWO, YOU'RE SEARCHING
THE BOAT AT THE MARINA.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.322
TEAM THREE, WE GOT THE OFFICE.

12:52.370 --> 12:57.364
NOW ANYONE FINDS ANYTHING,
YOU CALL IT IN IMMEDIATELY.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.809
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.178
ALL RIGHT, E.T.F.'s MOVING OUT
THREE T.A.C. TEAMS.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.302
THEY'LL MEET US THERE.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.310
MCNALLY.

13:07.350 --> 13:08.669
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:08.720 --> 13:10.278
THE HOSPITAL CLEARED ME.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.345
NOELLE AND TRACI ARE WAITING
ON THE A LITTLE BIT RESULTS.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.711
ANDY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS, OKAY?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.387
YOU WERE ASSAULTED
AND DRUGGED.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.489
LET HER WORK.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.486
COME ON.
ANDY'S THE ONLY PERSON

13:19.530 --> 13:22.124
WE KNOW FOR SURE WHO'S HAD
ANY CONTACT WITH THIS GUY.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.060
HOSPITAL SAID SHE'S OKAY.
LET HER DO HER JOB.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.624
WE NEED EVERYONE WE CAN GET,
RIGHT?

13:25.670 --> 13:28.594
FINE. BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT SEARCH.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.335
OKAY.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.003
YOU GOOD?
I'M GOOD, JERRY.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.905
OKAY. HEAD OVER TO THE ARCHER.
SEE IF ANYONE SAW CHARLIE DAVIS

13:35.940 --> 13:38.306
BACK THERE
AFTER WE RELEASED HIM.
OKAY.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.806
I'LL GET A RIDE WITH MCNALLY,
ALL RIGHT?

13:39.850 --> 13:41.818
OKAY.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.147
GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK,
BUDDY.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.884
UM, THANKS FOR THAT.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.979
I'M JUST HERE
TILL WE FIND HER.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.789
WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER
THE PHONE?

14:02.840 --> 14:05.001
WHEN GAIL CALLED YOU LAST NIGHT,
WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER?

14:05.040 --> 14:08.203
I WAS TIRED.
WE CALL EACH OTHER A LOT.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.878
I THOUGHT
IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.140
(scoffs) WHY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS?

14:12.180 --> 14:13.477
IS THAT ONE OF THE BENEFITS?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.169
YOU--YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THERE
WHEN SOMEBODY NEEDS YOU?

14:15.220 --> 14:16.619
LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:16.650 --> 14:17.878
I KNOW GAIL DESERVES BETTER.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.514
(scoffs) RIGHT. BETTER.
LIKE YOU.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.380
YEAH, SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY
CARES ABOUT HER.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.229
SOMEBODY WHO'D ANSWER
THE PHONE WHEN SHE CALLS.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.659
SOMEBODY WHO WOULD NEVER
LET THIS HAPPEN TO HER.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.248
OH, YOU THINK THIS IS MY FAULT?
YOU DON'T?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.359
YOU WANT TO HIT ME? HIT ME.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.425
THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP US
FIND HER.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.967
WE NEED TO TALK
TO ALL OF YOUR EMPLOYEES,

14:39.010 --> 14:40.534
EVERYBODY WHO WAS ON SHIFT
LAST NIGHT.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.332
THEN I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO COME BACK.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.507
THE EVENING SHIFT DOESN'T BEGIN
FOR ANOTHER SIX HOURS.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.177
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

14:46.210 --> 14:47.973
IT'S CONFERENCE SEASON.
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN HOME YET.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.238
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
PART OF OUR INVESTIGATION.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.485
I ALREADY TOLD DETECTIVE BARBER,
THIS HOTEL IS NOT RESPONSIBLE

14:52.520 --> 14:55.057
FOR ACTIVITY THAT TAKES PLACE
BETWEEN CONSENTING ADULTS.

14:55.090 --> 14:56.978
OKAY, LOOK, WE NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS MAN

14:57.030 --> 14:58.759
BETWEEN 1:30 AND 2:00 A.M.

14:58.790 --> 14:59.882
I THOUGHT YOU ARRESTED HIM.

14:59.930 --> 15:01.750
HE ABDUCTED ONE OF OUR OFFICERS
LAST NIGHT.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.358
WHAT?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.789
YEAH. WE THINK THAT HE CAME BACK
AND HE FOLLOWED HER FROM HERE.

15:05.830 --> 15:08.799
YOUR SECURITY CAMERAS--
DO THEY RECORD TO A HARD DRIVE?

15:08.840 --> 15:11.365
YES. YES. UH, IT HOLDS
30 DAYS' WORTH OF FOOTAGE.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.605
GREAT. GET IT ALL, PLEASE.
WE'LL NEED EVERYTHING.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.732
OKAY.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.568
YEAH. I GOT CHARLIE DAVIS
RIGHT HERE.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.943
WE GRABBED HIM FROM HIS OFFICE,
AND WE BROUGHT HIM IN.

15:27.220 --> 15:29.950
NO, WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
WHAT ABOUT THE BOAT?

15:31.690 --> 15:34.250
(door beeps and buzzes)

15:34.300 --> 15:36.052
OKAY, CHARLIE.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.298
I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED
OF THIS.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.228
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHERE MY OFFICER IS?

15:44.140 --> 15:45.767
LOOK...

15:47.480 --> 15:49.436
IF SHE'S OKAY,

15:49.480 --> 15:51.471
I'M GONNA MAKE IT CLEAR
THAT YOU COOPERATED.

15:51.510 --> 15:54.968
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT BITCH IS.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.716
(grunts)

15:57.750 --> 16:00.617
(filtered voice) I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HER,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.582
I MEAN, IF YOU HURT HER
IN ANY WAY,

16:02.620 --> 16:04.178
THAT WON'T BE ANYTHING

16:04.230 --> 16:06.152
COMPARED TO THE PAIN THAT
I'M GONNA BRING DOWN ON YOU.

16:06.190 --> 16:09.159
(grunts) HEY. HEY,
I WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.361
ALL RIGHT?
I WAS IN THIS CHAIR.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.938
AND THEN I WENT HOME. THERE ARE
CAMERAS ALL OVER MY HOUSE.

16:14.970 --> 16:17.131
CHECK WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY.
THEY'LL CONFIRM IT.

16:18.570 --> 16:20.401
LOOK, I... (groans)

16:20.440 --> 16:23.170
I KNOW THIS MUST BE
EMBARRASSING FOR YOU,

16:23.210 --> 16:26.702
SCREWING UP TWICE
IN 24 HOURS.

16:26.750 --> 16:31.983
(pants) BUT WHOEVER GRABBED
THAT COP LAST NIGHT,

16:32.020 --> 16:33.510
IT WASN'T ME.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.051
(sighs)

16:36.090 --> 16:38.524
(rattling)

16:38.560 --> 16:40.425
YOU KNOW, DETECTIVE,
I HOPE YOU HAVE OTHER INTERESTS

16:40.460 --> 16:45.227
OUTSIDE THIS JOB, BECAUSE ONCE
MY LAWYERS ARE DONE WITH YOU,

16:45.270 --> 16:46.794
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE IT
ANYMORE.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.695
(door beeps and buzzes)

16:58.050 --> 16:59.904
(door opens)

17:13.130 --> 17:15.451
WHERE AM I?

17:16.530 --> 17:18.464
AH.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.434
YOU'RE AWAKE.

17:20.470 --> 17:23.405
WHAT'S--WHAT'S IN MY ARM?
(water running)

17:26.270 --> 17:29.034
I'M JUST TRYING
TO KEEP YOU HYDRATED.

17:30.810 --> 17:35.110
THAT SEDATIVE CAN GIVE YOU
AN AWFUL HEADACHE.

17:35.150 --> 17:36.947
YEAH.

17:36.980 --> 17:39.915
SO WILL SMASHING YOUR ELBOW
IN MY FACE.

17:40.990 --> 17:43.129
SORRY THAT HAD TO HAPPEN.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.956
DON'T WORRY, THOUGH.

17:46.990 --> 17:49.925
I'M GONNA GET YOU
ALL FIXED UP.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.390
YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S TRYING TO SCARE ME,

17:54.440 --> 17:57.204
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE WEARING TAP SHOES.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.931
THEY'RE ACTUALLY...

18:02.610 --> 18:04.874
WING TIPS.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.309
I TAKE IT BACK.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.612
WING TIPS ARE TERRIFYING.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.386
I THINK... MAYBE...

18:17.430 --> 18:19.284
YOU WOKE UP TOO EARLY.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.798
YOU SHOULD
REALLY GET SOME REST.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:22.830 --> 18:24.764
NO. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.665
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SHH. SHH. SHH. JUST RELAX.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.567
JUST... RELAX.

18:31.870 --> 18:34.304
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.109
THIS IS EVERYTHING
FROM THE ARCHER.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.368
THERE'S NO SIGN THAT DAVIS
CAME BACK AFTER WE GRABBED HIM.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.071
NOTHING ON CAMERA ANWVAY.
THE COVERAGE IS PRETTY CRAPPY.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.917
WELL, THE SEARCH AT DAVIS' PLACE
DIDN'T TURN UP ANYTHING.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.212
WHAT ABOUT HIS ALIBI?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.480
IT CHECKS OUT.
SECURITY COMPANY HAS HIM HOME

18:48.520 --> 18:50.329
15 MINUTES
AFTER WE RELEASED HIM.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.622
I MEAN, THE GUY WAS HOME
ALL NIGHT.

18:51.660 --> 18:55.357
SO WE'RE BACK TO ZERO.
NO CLOSER TO FINDING GAIL.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.062
WELL, WE EXPAND OUR SEARCH.
LOOK FOR ANOTHER SUSPECT.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.988
LUKE, TELL ME YOU GOT SOMETHING.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.588
MAYBE.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.891
OKAY, YEAH, I'LL TAKE A "MAYBE."

19:02.940 --> 19:04.567
DIAZ AND THE NEW KID
FOUND A COUPLE OF BODIES

19:04.610 --> 19:07.272
RELATED TO SOME OLD CASES. IT'S
NOT EXACTLY ON PATTERN, BUT--

19:07.310 --> 19:08.607
CALL GIRLS?

19:08.640 --> 19:09.902
NO. ONE OF THE VICTIMS
HAD BEEN TRANQUILIZED

19:09.940 --> 19:12.306
WITH A MIXTURE OF KETAMINE
AND ACEPROMAZINE.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.318
I TRACED HER BACK
TO A DINNER RESERVATION

19:14.350 --> 19:16.215
AT THE ARCHER HOTEL
THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.649
SO THE CONNECTION'S THE HOTEL.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.987
LIKE I SAID, MAYBE.

19:19.020 --> 19:21.113
SOMEONE WHO WORKS THERE.
MAKES SENSE.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.321
OKAY, THE ONLY STAFF THAT KNEW
IT WAS A STING OPERATION

19:23.360 --> 19:25.282
WAS CRONE, THE MANAGER.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.491
EVERYONE ELSE THOUGHT IT WAS
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.088
STAFF WOULD BE
THE PERFECT COVER.

19:29.130 --> 19:30.722
LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY
TO PICK A TARGET.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.761
SURE.
MAKE CASUAL CONVERSATION,

19:32.800 --> 19:34.438
BUT NOBODY REALLY NOTICES
YOU'RE THERE.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.461
AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE

19:36.500 --> 19:40.539
AND HOW NOT TO BE SEEN
IF THEY FOLLOW SOMEBODY HOME.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.573
(indistinct conversations)

19:45.480 --> 19:46.845
(groans)

19:46.880 --> 19:48.017
IT'S BRAXTON HICKS.

19:48.050 --> 19:49.312
WHAT?

19:49.350 --> 19:51.238
FALSE LABOR.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.985
IT'S THE DRESS REHEARSAL
BEFORE THE BIG SHOW.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.658
I HAD 'EM FOR WEEKS.

19:54.690 --> 19:59.525
YEAH. WELL, MR. BRAXTON HICKS
CAN KISS MY PREGNANT ASS.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.528
THESE JUST
KEEP GETTING WORSE.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.595
SINCE WHEN?

20:02.630 --> 20:04.598
OH, LAST NIGHT.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.723
FRANK ORDERED THAI FOOD,
AND THEY HAVEN'T STOPPED SINCE.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.703
WELL, FALSE LABOR'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO LAST THAT LONG.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.674
NOELLE.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.405
THIS COULD BE
THE REAL THING.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.170
NO. NO WAY. NOT TODAY.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.815
NOT WITH GAIL OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE WITH SOME PSYCHO.

20:20.850 --> 20:24.183
BUT JERRY'S GOT THE WHOLE
SERVICE OUT LOOKING FOR HER.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.744
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW
YOU JUST NEED TO BE CONCERNED

20:25.790 --> 20:27.280
ABOUT YOURSELF FOR ONCE.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.584
I AM NOT HAVING
THIS BABY YET.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.520
OKAY.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.492
BUT IF YOU ARE
HAVING THIS BABY,

20:35.530 --> 20:39.523
I THINK WE SHOULD CALL FRANK.
LET HIM KNOW.

20:39.570 --> 20:40.935
NO.

20:40.970 --> 20:43.962
NOT WITH GAIL STILL MISSING.
HE HAS ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.898
I...

20:45.940 --> 20:48.135
I JUST HOPE
THEY'RE GETTING CLOSE.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.741
(indistinct conversations)

20:51.780 --> 20:53.611
22 STAFF ON SHIFT LAST NIGHT

20:53.650 --> 20:55.379
IN THE LOUNGE, LOBBY,
AND KITCHEN,

20:55.420 --> 20:58.048
INCLUDING SIX WITH PRIORS.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.046
SIX? THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.456
HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY?
NOT REALLY.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.980
WE GOT TH REE ASSAULTS,
TWO DRUG CHARGES,

21:04.030 --> 21:05.679
AND A MAIL FRAUD.

21:05.730 --> 21:06.981
(sighs)

21:07.030 --> 21:09.794
HEY, SAM.
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?

21:09.830 --> 21:10.819
BARTEN DER?

21:10.870 --> 21:11.962
UH-HUH.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.093
HE WAS HOVERING ALL NIGHT.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.359
SO ANYTHING GAIL SAID TO DAVIS,
HE COULD'VE HEARD.
YEAH.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.365
LET ME SEE THIS.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.378
"SETH MaCKEIGAN.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.833
MINOR ASSAULT,
POSSESSION WITH INTENT."

21:22.880 --> 21:25.075
IT'S HIM. IT'S GOTTA BE.

21:25.110 --> 21:27.169
I MEAN, THE BAR CLOSES AT 1:00.
HE WOULD'VE HAD TIME.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.269
IT SAYS HE DRIVES
A GRAY CAMRY.

21:31.150 --> 21:32.686
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.518
SURVEILLANCE TOOK IT 30 SECONDS
AFTER GAIL'S CAB LEFT.

21:37.190 --> 21:38.521
YEAH, GRAY CAMRY.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.289
HOW FAST CAN WE HAVE E.T.F
AT HIS HOUSE?

21:40.330 --> 21:42.093
WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.
WE'RE NOT GONNA BUST SOME GUY

21:42.130 --> 21:44.018
ON SOME MINOR CHARGES
FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

21:44.070 --> 21:46.026
FOR THE FACT THAT HE WAS NEAR
THE HOTEL WHERE HE WORKS.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.469
YEAH, BUT WHAT
IF THIS IS THE GUY?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.331
THEN WE PROVE IT.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.406
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'VE BLOWN THIS TWICE ALREADY

21:51.440 --> 21:54.170
BY JUMPING THE GUN, SO WE
JUST GOTTA SLOW THINGS DOWN

21:54.210 --> 21:57.179
AND TAKE OUR TIME AND--AND PUT
THESE PIECES TOGETHER.

21:57.210 --> 21:59.508
OKAY. OKAY.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST--
CHASING FALSE LEADS

21:59.550 --> 22:01.814
IS NOT GONNA HELP US
GET GAIL ANY FASTER.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.114
OKAY, PECK GOT INTO
SKYVIEW CAB 302.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.958
GO TALK TO THE CAB DRIVER.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.083
SEE IF HE REMEMBERS
BEING FOLLOWED BY MaCKEIGAN.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.121
THEN MAYBE I CAN GET
ANOTHER WARRANT.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.048
NO. WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.295
LOOK, JERRY. IT'S HIM.
IT'S THE BARTENDER, OKAY?

22:19.330 --> 22:20.888
HE SITS ALL NIGHT
WITH THESE GIRLS, OKAY,

22:20.940 --> 22:23.329
ASKS THEM WHO THEY ARE,
UH, WHAT THEY DO,

22:23.370 --> 22:25.133
WHETHER THEY LIVE ALONE OR NOT.
HE CAN ASK 'EM ANYTHING,

22:25.170 --> 22:26.603
AND THEY JUST THINK
HE'S BEING NICE.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.232
LOOK, JERRY,
I THINK MCNALLY'S RIGHT.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.271
WE'VE GOT A WINDOW. LET'S CHECK
ON THIS GUY RIGHT NOW.

22:30.310 --> 22:32.346
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. FINE. I'M
GONNA TRACK DOWN THE CAB DRIVER.

22:32.380 --> 22:33.745
YOU GUYS GO TO THE HOTEL.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.509
LEARN ANYTHING THAT
YOU CAN ABOUT MaCKEIGAN,

22:35.550 --> 22:38.189
ANYTHING THAT CAN GET US
THROUGH THE DOOR.

22:38.220 --> 22:41.257
AND NOBODY MAKES A MOVE ON HIM
UNTIL I SAY SO.

22:45.060 --> 22:46.755
TH ESE ARE
ALL SUSPICIOUS DEATHS?

22:46.790 --> 22:48.758
UH, WOMEN ALL OVER THE CITY,
THE LAST TEN YEARS.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.792
NOW THE RED ONES ARE WHERE
THE BODIES WERE DISCOVERED.

22:51.830 --> 22:54.139
THE GREEN ONES WERE
WHERE THEY WERE ABDUCTED

22:54.170 --> 22:55.364
OR WHERE THEY LIVED.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.061
AND THEY TRACE BACK
TO THE HOTEL.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.863
AT LEAST TWO, MAYBE THREE.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.707
WHICH ONE IS PECK?

23:00.740 --> 23:02.776
UH, WE AGREED WE'RE NOT
PUTTING HER UP THERE.

23:02.810 --> 23:04.175
RIGHT HERE.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.508
THESE ONES FIT. THIS IS
WHERE WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

23:06.550 --> 23:07.972
WHY IS HE DUMPING THEM
IN THE CITY?

23:08.020 --> 23:10.818
KNOWS THE AREA.
IT'S HIS COMFORT ZONE.

23:10.850 --> 23:12.784
SIR, PERMISSION
TO TAKE OUT A SQUAD?

23:13.760 --> 23:14.954
AND GO WHERE?

23:14.990 --> 23:17.584
NO OFFENSE.
I KNOW THIS IS POLICE WORK,

23:17.630 --> 23:19.427
BUT WE'RE NOT DETECT IVES.
WE'RE GRUNTS.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.496
PATROL OFFICERS. WE SHOULD BE
OUT THERE ON THE STREETS.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.122
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.594
HE'S BEEN DUMPING THE BODIES
IN THE SAME 10-BLOCK AREA.

23:25.630 --> 23:27.359
IF WE BEEF UP POLICE PRESENCE
IN HIS COMFORT ZONE,

23:27.400 --> 23:29.732
MAYBE HE'LL STAY AWAY FROM IT.
WE COULD BUY GAIL SOME TIME.

23:29.770 --> 23:31.408
I'M WITH NICK ON THIS ONE, SIR.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.704
I SAY WE RIDE AROUND
AND SEE WHAT WE SEE.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.276
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE.

23:38.310 --> 23:39.971
EVERYBODY'S ON THIS THING,
LUKE,

23:40.010 --> 23:41.819
SO I REALLY THINK
THAT WE SHOULD BE

23:41.850 --> 23:43.909
OUT ON THE STREETS
LOOKING FOR OUR GIRL.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.052
I'LL LET DISPATCH KNOW IF I CAN
NARROW IT DOWN ANY FURTHER.

23:51.190 --> 23:53.385
ANY LUCK WITH THE FOOTAGE
WE GAVE YOU?

23:53.430 --> 23:54.852
YEAH. WE NEED
SOME MORE INFORMATION

23:54.900 --> 23:56.595
ON ONE OF YOUR STAFF--
SETH MaCKEIGAN.

23:56.630 --> 23:58.291
WE NEED HIS VEHICLE PASS
FOR THE PARKING LOT

23:58.330 --> 23:59.627
AND HIS WORK SCHEDULE
SINCE HE STARTED HERE.

23:59.670 --> 24:02.468
SURE. BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK
TO HIM, HE'S RIGHT THERE.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.660
SETH.

24:03.710 --> 24:04.699
HEY.

24:04.740 --> 24:05.809
HEY. HEY!

24:08.510 --> 24:09.670
STOP!

24:09.710 --> 24:10.938
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.242
OKAY. OKAY.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.611
YEAH?
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH HER, HUH?

24:13.650 --> 24:15.140
EASY. EASY. EASY.
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH HER?

24:15.180 --> 24:16.511
WHAT? DO WITH WHO?

24:16.550 --> 24:18.814
JASMINE, THE BLONDE WHO WAS
AT THE BAR LAST NIGHT.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.249
YOU FOLLOWED HER HOME.

24:20.290 --> 24:21.450
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.355
YEAH, RIGHT. WHY'D YOU RUN?

24:23.390 --> 24:27.019
'CAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO FLUSH
THAT DOWN THE TOILET.
NO, THAT IS NOT MINE.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.824
LAST NIGHT--WHERE'D
YOU GO WHEN YOU LEFT HERE?

24:29.860 --> 24:32.397
I-I--JETPACK.
IT'S--IT'S AN AFTER-HOURS CLUB.

24:32.430 --> 24:33.692
I DEEJAY THERE SOMETIMES.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.298
OH, YEAH?
WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

24:35.340 --> 24:37.968
I-I GOT THERE JUST BEFORE 2:00,
AND THEN LEFT AT 5:00.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.329
REALLY?

24:39.370 --> 24:41.076
YEAH. AND SOME OF THE STAFF
WERE THERE. YOU CAN ASK THEM.

24:41.110 --> 24:43.772
YEAH, WE'LL DO THAT.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.506
(police radio chatter)

24:47.550 --> 24:49.108
OKAY. OW.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.549
OW.

24:51.350 --> 24:52.942
OKAY, THAT'S OKAY.
THAT IS OKAY.

24:52.990 --> 24:56.016
THEY ARE--
ARE HALF AN HOUR APART STILL,

24:56.060 --> 24:58.927
SO, YOU KNOW,
EVEN IF IT IS LABOR,

24:58.960 --> 25:01.554
THEN YOU GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.559
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE,
IT CAN TAKE A-A COUPLE OF DAYS.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.728
(cell phone rings)

25:08.770 --> 25:10.260
(ﬁng)

25:10.300 --> 25:12.962
(beep)
JERRY, I'VE CALLED YOU,
LIKE, THREE TIMES.

25:13.010 --> 25:15.274
YEAH. I CAN'T, UH,

25:15.310 --> 25:17.130
I CAN'T GET THIS STUPID THING
OFF MUTE.

25:17.180 --> 25:18.408
OKAY, DON'T DO IT NOW

25:18.450 --> 25:19.542
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST GONNA END UP
HANGING UP ON ME.

25:19.580 --> 25:20.979
What do you got?

25:21.020 --> 25:23.818
UH, THE LAB RESULTS
FROM ANDY'S BLOOD CAME IN.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.545
Yeah, let me guess--
Ketamine and Acepromazine.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.943
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

25:26.990 --> 25:29.754
WELL, NICOLE MARSHALL ALSO HAD
TRACES OF IT IN HER SYSTEM.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.121
IT'S A MEDICAL TRANQUILIZER,

25:31.160 --> 25:33.594
BUT THE MIX IS TRICKY TO
ADMINISTER IN THE PROPER DOSE.

25:33.630 --> 25:36.451
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.569
ANY LEADS?

25:37.600 --> 25:38.862
Well, we think Peck
may have been followed

25:38.900 --> 25:40.788
by a staff member
at the Archer.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.660
A HISTORY OF DRUGS.
I'M WORKING ON IT NOW.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.702
You think he's the guy?

25:44.740 --> 25:46.298
I DON'T... (sighs)

25:46.340 --> 25:49.798
LOOK, HE BETTER BE, BECAUSE
I'M--I'M RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.843
I WOULD COME AND JOIN YOU,
BUT, UM,

25:56.250 --> 25:57.478
NOELLE'S IN LABOR.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.442
ALREADY?
Yeah, but don't tell Frank

25:59.490 --> 26:00.809
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT HIM
TO WORRY.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.816
YEAH. YEAH.
NO, YOU STAY THERE,

26:02.860 --> 26:04.054
AND I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON
AS WE KNOW SOMETHING.

26:04.090 --> 26:06.024
(Noelle screams) OW!

26:06.060 --> 26:08.153
OKAY, JER, I GOTTA GO.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.428
ALL RIGHT.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.188
(cell phone beeps)

26:15.840 --> 26:18.206
(dog barking in distance)

26:28.250 --> 26:29.717
ROSS PERIK?

26:29.750 --> 26:31.115
UH, THAT'S RIGHT.

26:31.150 --> 26:33.710
I'M DETECTIVE JERRY BARBER,
15 DIVISION.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.149
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT
ONE OF YOUR FARES LAST NIGHT.

26:36.190 --> 26:37.487
DO YOU MIND
IF I COME IN A MINUTE?

26:37.520 --> 26:40.080
UH, BY ALL MEANS, DETECTIVE.
COME ON IN.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.529
THAN KS.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.839
(dog continues barking)

26:49.870 --> 26:54.136
***

26:55.840 --> 26:58.604
SO, YOU HAD A QUESTION
ABOUT ONE OF MY FARES?

26:58.650 --> 26:59.969
YEAH, A WOMAN YOU PICKED UP
LAST NIGHT

27:00.010 --> 27:01.671
AT THE ARCHER AROUND 1:30.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.779
UH, I'M THERE A LOT.
I DON'T REALLY, UH,

27:03.820 --> 27:05.617
PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION
TO FACES.

27:05.650 --> 27:08.187
WELL, SHE'S BLONDE,
UH, MID-20$,

27:08.220 --> 27:09.710
QUITE POSSIBLY
NOT VERY NICE.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.921
OH, YES,
THAT DOES RING A BELL.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.952
AND YOU DROPPED HER OFF
AT 2768 CARLAW.

27:17.230 --> 27:19.323
SHE'S A POLICE OFFICER.

27:19.370 --> 27:21.258
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.666
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT
FROM THE WAY SHE WAS DRESSED.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.769
OH, SO YOU DO REMEMBER?

27:25.810 --> 27:27.459
UH, W-WAS THERE A PROBLEM?

27:27.510 --> 27:29.774
DID SHE... COMPLAIN
ABOUT THE SERVICE?

27:29.810 --> 27:32.643
NOW DO YOU REMEMBER
BEING FOLLOWED?

27:32.680 --> 27:35.376
OR MAYBE YOU SAW SOMEONE
WHEN YOU DROPPED HER OFF?

27:35.420 --> 27:37.911
YOU KNOW, COME TO THINK OF IT,
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN

27:37.950 --> 27:39.918
A SET OF LIGHTS BEHIND ME
FOR A WHILE,

27:39.950 --> 27:42.282
BUT IT'S, UH...
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.981
OKAY. DO YOU REMEMBER
A COLOR OR MAKE?

27:45.060 --> 27:46.925
UH, NO, I'M SORRY.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.518
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.357
WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT TIME YOU DROPPED HER OFF?

27:50.400 --> 27:53.119
IT MIGHT HELP US FIGURE OUT
WHO ELSE WAS ON THE STREET.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.661
UH... I-I'M NOT SURE.

27:55.700 --> 27:58.339
UM, UH, PROBABLY 1:45,
2:00-ISH.

27:58.370 --> 28:01.237
WELL, YOUR METER WOULD HAVE
THE EXACT TIME, RIGHT?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.804
UNLESS YOU WEREN'T
RUNNING YOUR METER.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.444
I KNOW SOMETIMES THOSE THINGS
GET, UH...

28:04.480 --> 28:05.742
(sniffs) SWITCHED OFF--

28:05.780 --> 28:06.906
BY ACCIDENT, OF COURSE.

28:06.950 --> 28:10.374
NO. DETECTIVE, I ALWAYS
RUN MY METER.

28:10.420 --> 28:13.446
IT'S THE LAW.
I'LL JUST GET THE LOG.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.378
WOULD YOU, UM...

28:15.420 --> 28:17.411
COULD YOU JUST WAIT HERE
FOR A SECOND?

28:17.460 --> 28:19.485
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.
THANK YOU.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.468
EVERY EMPLOYEE WHO HAD
CONTACT WITH GAIL LAST NIGHT

28:25.500 --> 28:26.819
CHECKS OUT.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.735
OKAY, SO--SO WHO ELSE
DID SHE HAVE CONTACT WITH?

28:28.770 --> 28:30.499
MAYBE SHE TALKED TO
ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.407
NO. NO. I MEAN, I TOOK HER
OUT HERE PERSONALLY,

28:33.440 --> 28:36.375
AND I PUT HER
STRAIGHT IN A CAB.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.802
(sighs) so YOU PUT HER
IN A CAB...

28:38.850 --> 28:39.976
I PUT HER IN THE CAB.
I TOLD HER

28:40.010 --> 28:41.341
THAT I WOULD BE STAYING
WITH YOU.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.541
YOU KNOW, THAT SHE WOULD
HAVE THE PLACE TO HERSELF.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.813
MAYBE SOMEONE OVERHEARD YOU--

28:46.850 --> 28:49.114
SOMEONE YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
THINK WAS LISTENING.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.787
SAME CABBIES COME HERE
EVERY NIGHT.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.219
PEOPLE GET IN, TELL THEM
EXACTLY WHERE THEY LIVE.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.057
THE CAB DRIVER.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.660
(Velcro tears)
THAT'S WHO JERRY
WANTED US TO CHECK OUT,

28:57.700 --> 28:59.190
BUT THEN HE SAID
HE WOULD DO IT.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.095
(cell phone dialing)
I HOPE HE ANSWERS
HIS DAMN PHONE.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.859
THREE MONTHS, YOU'D THINK
HE'D FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.832
(breathing heavily)

29:05.870 --> 29:07.167
COME ON.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.718
THIS, UH, PICTURE
ON YOUR BOOKSHELF--

29:20.750 --> 29:23.218
WHERE IS IT?

29:23.260 --> 29:25.023
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I
ARE GETTING MARRIED,

29:25.060 --> 29:27.858
AND WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A PLACE TO HONEYMOON.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.097
OH, UH, THAT'S SOMALIA.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.108
SOMALIA? HUH.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.207
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.673
CHARITY WORK.
WITH DOCTORS ABROAD.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.377
YOU'RE A VOLUNTEER?

29:50.420 --> 29:51.887
M.D., ACTUALLY.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.059
OR I USED TO BE.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.479
I NEEDED A CHANGE.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.887
SOMETHING A LITTLE
LESS STRESSFUL.

29:59.930 --> 30:01.727
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND,
DETECTIVE.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.057
(clicks tongue)

30:04.070 --> 30:06.026
BELIEVE ME, I DO.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.895
SO, UH...

30:09.940 --> 30:12.204
DO YOU MISS IT--
MEDICINE?

30:12.240 --> 30:13.229
SOMETIMES.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.476
(unholsters gun)

30:14.510 --> 30:17.104

30:23.180 --> 30:24.442
(blade slices)

30:26.090 --> 30:27.546
I'M SORRY...

30:27.590 --> 30:29.751
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME HERE.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.726
(blade plunges)
(grunts)

30:32.760 --> 30:36.355
(gasping)

30:44.010 --> 30:46.137
OKAY. SKWIEW CAB

IS REGISTERED
TO A ROSS PERIK.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.307

30:49.340 --> 30:50.807
ALL RIGHT.
CALL JERRY AGAIN.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.307
TELL HIM NOT TO GO IN
WITHOUT BACKUP.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.476
TELL HIM TO WAIT FOR US.

30:53.510 --> 30:56.718
(siren wailing)

30:57.850 --> 31:02.014
(breathing unevenly)

31:24.780 --> 31:26.202
YOU'RE A COP.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.877
(murmurs) WHAT?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.571
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?!

31:30.620 --> 31:33.714

TAKING CARE OF YOU.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.819

32:15.000 --> 32:17.696
I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
