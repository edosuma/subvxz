This week on Vice:

00:09.392 --> 00:11.760
combating crime on the Web.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074

00:20.970 --> 00:22.130
You've been in less than a minute

00:22.131 --> 00:24.339
and you have four private messages.

00:26.176 --> 00:28.476
And then, the fight for jobs

00:28.511 --> 00:29.944
in coal country.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.747
We're a couple of miles
deep into the mountain.

00:33.783 --> 00:37.517
This is the most terrifying place
to be if you're claustrophobic.

00:37.553 --> 00:41.488
This community is founded on coal.

00:41.523 --> 00:43.323
There's nothing else.

00:49.931 --> 00:51.298
Go, go, go!

00:54.169 --> 00:55.602
We are not animals!

01:07.281 --> 01:08.748
Never in human history

01:08.783 --> 01:11.718
has there been such universal
access to information.

01:11.753 --> 01:14.721
Now, this has been the result
of the spread of the Internet

01:14.756 --> 01:16.055
around the world.

01:16.091 --> 01:19.225
But this increased connectivity
also has a dark side,

01:19.260 --> 01:22.894
allowing global criminal
economies to flourish online.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.463
We embedded with the agents

01:24.499 --> 01:26.432
from the Department
of Homeland Security,

01:26.467 --> 01:27.833
as they scramble to combat

01:27.868 --> 01:30.002
this burgeoning sector of the Internet.

01:38.411 --> 01:40.545
We're at an undisclosed location

01:40.580 --> 01:42.948
where an undercover agent with HSI

01:42.983 --> 01:44.983
has been tracking a
woman in the Philippines,

01:45.019 --> 01:47.585
who has been exploiting children,
including her own daughter,

01:47.621 --> 01:49.287
to perform sex acts online.

01:49.322 --> 01:52.090
The undercover agent,
who we'll call Mike,

01:52.126 --> 01:54.192
is posing as a pedophile
who wants to buy

01:54.227 --> 01:57.162
an online sex show
featuring young children.

01:57.197 --> 02:00.198
"Please, all girls are here now."

02:06.950 --> 02:08.406
Doggie style, spread legs...

02:10.508 --> 02:13.577
The suspected pimp is
located in the Philippines,

02:13.612 --> 02:16.147
so Mike is sharing this
evidence in real time

02:16.182 --> 02:18.282
with anti-trafficking agents in Manila

02:18.317 --> 02:20.951
who are gearing up to raid the location.

02:56.654 --> 02:59.088
The woman puts the children on camera,

02:59.123 --> 03:02.592
giving Mike the evidence he
needs to launch the operation.

03:04.495 --> 03:06.962
So, the youngest is five,
and the oldest is 13,

03:06.997 --> 03:08.731
and there's seven of them.

03:28.415 --> 03:32.254
Mommy!

03:48.371 --> 03:49.637
How are you feeling?

04:13.028 --> 04:15.729
The global production
of child pornography

04:15.765 --> 04:18.298
has become a multi-billion
dollar industry,

04:18.334 --> 04:21.935
and the number of images and
videos being distributed online

04:21.970 --> 04:23.536
is skyrocketing.

04:23.571 --> 04:28.074
One of the biggest markets for
this illicit material is the US.

04:29.511 --> 04:31.178
So, each pin represents

04:31.213 --> 04:34.547
a individual IP address where...

04:34.582 --> 04:36.883
child pornography files are being shared

04:36.919 --> 04:38.117
within the last hour.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.452
So this is right now?

04:39.487 --> 04:41.854
This is right now, and
this will keep going.

04:41.889 --> 04:43.989
- It's not stopping?
- No, and it won't.

04:44.025 --> 04:47.026
It will literally cover the
whole country eventually.

04:49.997 --> 04:52.532
Analysts here comb
through vast quantities

04:52.567 --> 04:53.866
of sexual abuse imagery,

04:53.901 --> 04:58.037
looking for clues to identify
perpetrators  and victims.

04:58.072 --> 05:00.039
In 2015, they analyzed

05:00.074 --> 05:02.975
more than 7,500 terabytes of data,

05:03.010 --> 05:07.179
or the equivalent of
almost 100 years of video.

05:07.215 --> 05:08.981
Division Chief Mike Prado

05:09.016 --> 05:12.484
acknowledged his team is
facing an uphill battle.

05:12.519 --> 05:13.985
The enormity of the problem

05:14.020 --> 05:16.287
is... undebatable.

05:16.323 --> 05:17.856
Back in the late '90s, when the Internet

05:17.891 --> 05:20.258
really became ubiquitous
across the United States,

05:20.293 --> 05:23.094
um, we saw a major increase

05:23.129 --> 05:26.164
in child exploitation material
being traded and trafficked.

05:26.199 --> 05:28.466
Unfortunately, as we continue to see

05:28.501 --> 05:30.768
the use of the Internet
grow in developing countries,

05:30.803 --> 05:33.771
we've seen that problem
continue to exponentially grow.

05:33.806 --> 05:36.307
What kind of resources
does it take to do this?

05:36.343 --> 05:38.309
We're seeing increases

05:38.345 --> 05:40.411
on average of about 20 to 30 percent

05:40.446 --> 05:41.980
every year, each year,

05:42.015 --> 05:44.615
in the amount of data that our
forensic examiners have to go through.

05:44.650 --> 05:47.251
So, I mean, it is a full-time,

05:47.286 --> 05:49.620
24-hours-a-day operation,

05:49.655 --> 05:51.389
going through this material.

05:51.424 --> 05:54.958
Stopping the spread of these
digital images is crucial,

05:54.994 --> 05:56.694
because a recent government study showed

05:56.729 --> 05:58.562
that more than half of the individuals

05:58.598 --> 06:00.563
who admitted to watching child porn,

06:00.599 --> 06:02.933
also admitted to
physically abusing a child.

06:02.968 --> 06:06.336
Back in the Philippines,
HSI Special Agent Mike,

06:06.372 --> 06:10.073
was investigating a case that
followed this type of escalation.

06:10.109 --> 06:12.376
So, this guy, how long have
you been talking to him?

06:41.041 --> 06:42.807
We followed Mike to a restaurant,

06:42.843 --> 06:46.044
where he'd arranged to meet
his target, known as Kim.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.712
Although he's never met Kim,

06:47.747 --> 06:50.882
he's seen plenty of pictures
of the girls he was selling.

07:24.683 --> 07:27.784
Once the deal was made,
Kim expected an easy payday

07:27.820 --> 07:32.122
for bringing underage girls to a
sex party at Mike's rented condo.

07:40.350 --> 07:41.364
Which is what?

07:46.505 --> 07:50.407
One strike team was staged
in an apartment down the hall,

07:50.442 --> 07:53.009
while another set up in
the condo's master bedroom

07:53.045 --> 07:55.478
to record the evidence.

09:19.128 --> 09:21.161
As soon as Kim takes the money,

09:21.196 --> 09:23.029
the strike team can move in.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.854
Go, go, go! Go!

09:59.007 --> 10:00.566
Hey!

10:22.690 --> 10:24.189
Kim's crimes now carry

10:24.224 --> 10:27.525
a mandatory life sentence
in the Philippines.

10:27.561 --> 10:29.460
But as we learned the next day,

10:29.496 --> 10:31.929
Kim wasn't willing to pay that price.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.498
What happened yesterday?

10:33.533 --> 10:36.834
Unfortunately, um...

10:36.869 --> 10:38.336
he committed suicide.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.038
While in custody, Kim hung himself

10:41.074 --> 10:43.373
with the cord of an electric fan.

10:49.248 --> 10:52.216
Apprehending a single
predator is difficult enough,

10:52.251 --> 10:55.352
but it doesn't compare to the
challenge of rehabilitating

10:55.387 --> 11:00.390
the tens of thousands of Filipino
children who are abused each year.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.126
It's up to nonprofits,
like the Preda Foundation,

11:03.161 --> 11:06.330
to help them begin the
long road to recovery.

11:46.671 --> 11:48.436
Counselor Eresa Venson

11:48.472 --> 11:51.673
can personally attest
that this therapy works.

12:08.392 --> 12:10.625
While places like Preda do their best,

12:10.661 --> 12:12.960
they simply can't cope
with the sheer volume

12:12.996 --> 12:15.330
of children showing up at their doors.

12:15.365 --> 12:17.198
And as Internet access spreads further

12:17.233 --> 12:19.701
into poor communities
across the Philippines,

12:19.736 --> 12:23.070
the reports of abuse
have grown exponentially

12:23.106 --> 12:27.541
to almost 50,000 cases in 2015.

12:27.576 --> 12:31.112
The difficult part of this
job is that we can't do more,

12:31.147 --> 12:33.480
that there is only so
many hours in a day.

12:33.516 --> 12:35.149
There's only so many agents

12:35.185 --> 12:37.050
and detectives and police officers

12:37.085 --> 12:39.886
that have the ability,

12:39.922 --> 12:41.888
the time, the resources

12:41.924 --> 12:43.156
to devote to this problem,

12:43.192 --> 12:45.326
because we know, at the end of the day,

12:45.361 --> 12:48.295
when we go home, that this material

12:48.331 --> 12:50.197
is continuing to be produced.

12:50.232 --> 12:53.566
There's no doubt that
more can and should be done

12:53.601 --> 12:54.935
across the board.

12:54.970 --> 12:56.703
While authorities struggle

12:56.738 --> 12:58.738
to contain the spread of child porn,

12:58.773 --> 13:00.573
a radical experiment is underway,

13:00.608 --> 13:04.444
that might turn the tide in the
fight against online predators.

13:24.999 --> 13:28.600
Sweetie, an avatar of an
11-year-old Filipino girl,

13:28.635 --> 13:31.503
was created by a Dutch
NGO called Terre Des Hommes

13:31.538 --> 13:34.306
as a digital solution
to a digital problem.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.880
One of Sweetie's
operators agreed to show us

13:40.915 --> 13:43.782
just how effective she is
at identifying predators.

13:45.652 --> 13:47.753
You've been in less than a minute

13:47.788 --> 13:51.771
and you have four private messages.

13:52.526 --> 13:55.660
"What about your pussy?" How
many people are in this chat?

14:06.839 --> 14:09.473
Sweetie is the brainchild of Hans Guijt,

14:09.509 --> 14:11.910
one of the directors
at Terre Des Hommes.

14:11.945 --> 14:13.311
The moment you go online

14:13.346 --> 14:16.447
and pretend to be a 10- or
11-year-old child from the Philippines,

14:16.482 --> 14:17.915
they just jump on you.

14:17.950 --> 14:19.165
And they're so eager

14:19.166 --> 14:21.619
that actually they volunteer
all sorts of information

14:21.654 --> 14:24.321
which you can use to
identify the perpetrators.

14:29.094 --> 14:32.396
During a 10-week test,
Sweetie's four operators

14:32.431 --> 14:35.299
were able to identify over 1,000 men

14:35.334 --> 14:36.967
from 71 countries.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.668
They did an incredible job,

14:38.703 --> 14:42.105
but they only covered 19
chat rooms on the Internet.

14:42.141 --> 14:44.341
So, 19 chat rooms is nothing.

14:44.376 --> 14:46.276
We need to scale up.

14:46.312 --> 14:48.778
You can no longer work
with human operators.

14:48.814 --> 14:50.747
You need to look for an alternative,

14:50.782 --> 14:53.583
and the alternative is
artificial intelligence,

14:53.618 --> 14:55.652
the application of chatbots,

14:55.687 --> 14:57.053
and that's exactly what we're doing.

14:57.088 --> 15:00.890
Sweetie 2.0 will have
sophisticated new avatars

15:00.926 --> 15:02.959
based on motion capture technology,

15:02.994 --> 15:06.996
and will be fully automated so
that a virtual army of Sweetie-bots

15:07.031 --> 15:08.464
can patrol the Web,

15:08.499 --> 15:10.599
identifying potential predators

15:10.634 --> 15:12.634
on an industrial scale.

15:12.670 --> 15:15.671
Instead of conducting three
of four chats with individuals,

15:15.706 --> 15:18.907
we'll have hundreds of
conversations simultaneously.

15:18.943 --> 15:22.878
One of our objectives is to
make sure that law enforcement

15:22.913 --> 15:24.913
will take over this work.

15:24.949 --> 15:26.782
We have to do something about it.

15:26.817 --> 15:29.050
And the only way to
do something about it

15:29.086 --> 15:30.352
is to look on the Internet,

15:30.387 --> 15:33.722
and find out who is sitting on
the other side of the webcam.

15:36.927 --> 15:38.093
The coal industry

15:38.128 --> 15:39.494
became one of the focal points

15:39.529 --> 15:40.996
of the 2016 election,

15:41.031 --> 15:43.999
with President Trump making
the return of coal mining

15:44.034 --> 15:46.901
a central campaign promise.

15:46.936 --> 15:48.603
We're going to save the coal industry!

15:48.638 --> 15:50.372
We're going to save that coal industry!

15:50.407 --> 15:52.007
Believe me, we're gonna save it.

15:52.042 --> 15:54.142
But in the span of just one year,

15:54.177 --> 15:56.176
three of America's
largest coal companies

15:56.212 --> 15:57.478
filed for bankruptcy

15:57.514 --> 15:59.046
and dozens of mines closed,

15:59.081 --> 16:00.982
leaving the sector reeling.

16:01.017 --> 16:04.018
So we sent Isobel Yeung to
the heart of coal country

16:04.053 --> 16:06.286
to see what it will take to revitalize

16:06.322 --> 16:09.256
this controversial industry in America.

16:19.902 --> 16:22.869
We are heading right into the belly

16:22.905 --> 16:25.105
of a coal mine in Eastern Kentucky

16:25.141 --> 16:27.141
where they're extracting

16:27.176 --> 16:29.275
what looks like a hell of a lot of coal.

16:35.651 --> 16:38.585
We're a couple of miles
deep into the mountain.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.887
I'll tell you, this is the
most terrifying place to be

16:40.923 --> 16:43.256
if you're claustrophobic.

16:43.291 --> 16:47.093
Each side you can see
these deep, kind of, caves.

16:47.128 --> 16:49.495
They've all been
blocked off, sealed off.

16:49.531 --> 16:52.365
That's where they've already
extracted all the coal they can.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.068
So we're having to go deeper
and deeper into the mountain.

17:22.929 --> 17:25.564
There used to be about 900 or so people

17:25.598 --> 17:28.099
working on this site at any given time.

17:28.135 --> 17:29.568
Now there's about 200.

17:29.603 --> 17:30.969
Advances in technology

17:31.004 --> 17:32.904
have revolutionized coal mining.

17:32.939 --> 17:36.540
But this machinery, paired with
the rise of cheap natural gas,

17:36.576 --> 17:39.043
has led to a huge decline in coal jobs.

17:39.079 --> 17:41.245
This has miners like Bridgett Cowden

17:41.280 --> 17:42.947
worried about their future.

17:42.983 --> 17:45.817
Coal has been in my
family for centuries.

17:45.852 --> 17:48.219
You know, grandpas, great-grandpas.

17:48.254 --> 17:50.588
I remember when I was little
bitty, my papaw would come in

17:50.623 --> 17:52.223
and he'd be all black.

17:52.258 --> 17:53.824
And I'd get in his little bucket

17:53.859 --> 17:55.459
pretending that I was in the coal mines.

17:55.495 --> 17:58.028
And that was when I
was five, six year old.

17:58.063 --> 18:02.199
But here, right now,
you're lucky to get a job.

18:02.235 --> 18:04.735
I've been in quite a few
mines, just in Perry County

18:04.770 --> 18:06.670
that shut down

18:06.705 --> 18:08.905
because they just,
they couldn't afford it.

18:08.941 --> 18:10.373
You must have seen a lot
of people get laid off.

18:10.408 --> 18:13.777
Yeah, a lot of good friends got
laid off, you know, and it's hard.

18:13.812 --> 18:16.813
You just, you thank the
Lord every day for a job.

18:16.849 --> 18:19.149
Are you hopeful that Trump's
gonna turn things around?

18:19.184 --> 18:20.517
I'm hoping.

18:20.552 --> 18:23.186
He promised he was going
to do what he could,

18:23.221 --> 18:24.420
and Hillary...

18:24.456 --> 18:27.357
I was for Hillary, I'm just
gonna be honest, at first,

18:27.392 --> 18:30.126
until she said...

18:30.162 --> 18:31.927
that she wasn't for coal,

18:31.963 --> 18:34.730
and that was it for me. I
didn't have nothing else.

18:34.766 --> 18:36.132
I was gonna vote for Trump.

18:36.168 --> 18:38.468
Do you think a lot of people
felt the same way about that?

18:38.503 --> 18:40.602
In coal mines, yes, they did.

18:40.638 --> 18:43.639
For the first half of the 20th century,

18:43.675 --> 18:46.241
coal was America's
primary source of energy,

18:46.277 --> 18:47.777
and a lucrative industry.

18:47.812 --> 18:49.378
But over the last three decades,

18:49.413 --> 18:51.914
coal jobs have declined 70 percent,

18:51.949 --> 18:54.283
and economists like
Dr. Erik Brynjolfsson

18:54.318 --> 18:56.185
doubt that they'll ever return.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.687
There's no way it's economically viable

18:58.722 --> 19:01.022
to restart most of the coal mines.

19:01.058 --> 19:04.593
It's simply a fact that
coal has become uncompetitive

19:04.628 --> 19:06.328
versus natural gas, and increasingly,

19:06.363 --> 19:09.798
solar, hydro, wind power.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.067
So hard-minded capitalists
are looking at that

19:12.102 --> 19:15.570
and saying this is not an
industry that we want to invest in,

19:15.605 --> 19:19.574
and there's no point in
trying to reverse that tide.

19:19.609 --> 19:22.476
What's the significance of Appalachia
and the coal country as a whole,

19:22.512 --> 19:26.214
when it comes to the
US economy at-large?

19:26.249 --> 19:27.916
I think Appalachia is symptomatic

19:27.951 --> 19:32.220
of the biggest economic challenge
that our society faces today.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.388
The powerful forces of technology

19:34.424 --> 19:37.325
are fundamentally
transforming our economy.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.493
Cars are beginning to drive themselves.

19:39.529 --> 19:42.196
Machines are diagnosing diseases.

19:42.232 --> 19:44.232
This is a whole new ball game,

19:44.267 --> 19:46.200
and it's having fundamental effects

19:46.235 --> 19:47.968
on the nature of the workforce.

19:48.003 --> 19:51.471
Sadly, I think most of the US
economy is not very well prepared.

19:52.842 --> 19:56.176
Coal has not only been central
to Appalachia's economy,

19:56.212 --> 19:58.779
but also to its history and culture.

20:00.149 --> 20:01.849
State Representative Chris Harris

20:01.884 --> 20:04.183
took us on a tour of his constituency,

20:04.219 --> 20:06.119
starting with a recently closed mine.

20:07.789 --> 20:11.491
Most of the communities in eastern
Kentucky, southern West Virginia,

20:11.526 --> 20:16.763
were built on those people who
came here to work in the mines.

20:16.798 --> 20:20.767
There was a tremendous
recruitment effort at Ellis Island

20:20.802 --> 20:24.871
to bring people to the Appalachian
region to work in the coal mines,

20:24.906 --> 20:27.706
because they could offer
you a home to live in.

20:27.742 --> 20:30.709
They could educate your
kids and give you a job.

20:30.745 --> 20:33.045
And those are things
that people really wanted

20:33.081 --> 20:36.214
when they came to this country,
looking for the American Dream.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.984
People here aren't...
they're not in love with coal.

20:39.019 --> 20:40.719
They're in love with the American Dream,

20:40.755 --> 20:42.988
and it's being taken away from us.

20:43.423 --> 20:47.092
Since the entire local
community relies on coal,

20:47.127 --> 20:48.794
the ripple effects of its decline

20:48.829 --> 20:51.497
are being felt far beyond the mines.

20:53.267 --> 20:54.565
Terri Blake and her husband

20:54.601 --> 20:56.868
have owned this
once-thriving hardware store

20:56.904 --> 20:58.469
for the last 28 years.

20:58.505 --> 21:00.438
This is what we've done all of our life.

21:00.473 --> 21:02.107
How's business?

21:02.142 --> 21:04.442
Keeps getting worse over
the last three years.

21:04.477 --> 21:05.844
To the point where...

21:05.879 --> 21:08.379
you wonder if you're gonna be
able to hold on another month.

21:08.415 --> 21:10.353
How well was business
doing a few years ago,

21:10.354 --> 21:13.518
- and how bad are things now?
- I'm off at least 35 percent.

21:13.553 --> 21:17.555
That's basically to say, if you was
doing a hundred thousand a month,

21:17.590 --> 21:20.191
I'm down to 65 thousand a month.

21:20.226 --> 21:22.293
There is no profit left after that.

21:22.329 --> 21:24.962
So, I mean, it just trickles
all the way down from the top.

21:24.997 --> 21:27.731
The coal mine shuts down, you know,

21:27.766 --> 21:29.399
it shuts something else down,

21:29.435 --> 21:31.068
then it shuts something else down,

21:31.103 --> 21:32.402
and that's where we're at now.

21:32.438 --> 21:34.138
There's no money left.

21:34.173 --> 21:36.440
The individuals that's living here

21:36.475 --> 21:39.509
have even had to take over the
lighting system here in Warfield,

21:39.545 --> 21:41.045
just to have lights at nighttime.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.979
So, individuals have to
pay for the streetlights?

21:43.014 --> 21:46.049
Well, yeah. Because we have no
money coming into our town anymore

21:46.084 --> 21:47.951
that paid for the streetlights.

21:47.986 --> 21:49.653
Coal is our industry here.

21:49.688 --> 21:51.455
This is how we make our living.

21:51.490 --> 21:53.523
When coal hurts, we all hurt.

21:55.361 --> 21:57.861
And while the market
continues to work against coal,

21:57.896 --> 21:59.528
the people who are hit hardest

21:59.564 --> 22:02.265
are often families who
can't afford to leave.

22:03.534 --> 22:05.201
Virginia Williams and her family

22:05.237 --> 22:07.036
have struggled to make ends meet

22:07.072 --> 22:09.438
after her husband was
laid off from the mines.

22:09.474 --> 22:12.141
I found a job at 7-Eleven.

22:12.177 --> 22:14.510
With the both of us working now,

22:14.545 --> 22:16.111
makes up his one income.

22:17.515 --> 22:20.483
We've been getting creative a long time.

22:20.518 --> 22:22.718
So, it's like, spaghetti,

22:22.754 --> 22:25.421
you know, you can get the dollar-can.

22:25.456 --> 22:27.390
But, uh, you make it do.

22:27.425 --> 22:29.759
Some days, it's a lot of potatoes.

22:30.762 --> 22:33.428
Well, the Food City card saved, uh...

22:33.463 --> 22:36.398
It saved you $2.08 today.

22:36.433 --> 22:37.732
That's a good deal.

22:41.238 --> 22:42.371
- Hi!
- Hey.

22:42.406 --> 22:45.340
I worked in the mines for 12 years.

22:45.376 --> 22:47.909
I was one of the unfortunate
ones that got laid off.

22:47.944 --> 22:51.245
John has spent the last three
years in and out of work.

22:51.281 --> 22:54.382
For the past two months, he's
been working as a contractor

22:54.418 --> 22:56.117
for a fraction of the pay.

22:56.152 --> 22:58.185
Is it steady work you have now?

22:58.221 --> 23:01.823
Yes, it is. The pay is not as
good as what the mine's was.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.758
You had to take a pay cut?

23:04.794 --> 23:07.962
About $17 an hour difference.

23:07.997 --> 23:11.332
That means at least
$35,000 less per year

23:11.367 --> 23:12.833
for a family of eight,

23:12.868 --> 23:14.802
which has left John holding onto hope

23:14.837 --> 23:16.837
that coal jobs will return.

23:16.872 --> 23:18.572
This is the last hat that I wore.

23:18.607 --> 23:20.341
Uh, I wore it underground.

23:20.376 --> 23:23.143
This is probably the same one
I would wear if I went back.

23:24.847 --> 23:28.148
What do you think it is
about working in coal mines

23:28.183 --> 23:31.585
that people from outside of
this region misunderstand?

23:31.620 --> 23:34.220
That we can afford to not have it.

23:34.256 --> 23:36.222
I mean, don't get me wrong,

23:36.258 --> 23:38.391
I'm all for being green,

23:38.427 --> 23:41.394
I'm all for solar power, wind power,

23:41.430 --> 23:43.396
you know, all that.

23:43.432 --> 23:46.632
But this community and this area,

23:46.668 --> 23:48.801
is founded...

23:48.837 --> 23:50.736
on coal.

23:50.772 --> 23:53.106
There's nothing else.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.741
And for it to not be here

23:55.777 --> 23:58.511
is disastrous for this area.

23:58.546 --> 24:00.913
But it doesn't have to be.

24:00.949 --> 24:03.215
It now falls on the next generation

24:03.250 --> 24:05.585
to consider a future without coal.

24:05.620 --> 24:08.823
I'm hoping that with
technologies advancing

24:08.824 --> 24:09.824
and different things like that,

24:09.857 --> 24:13.258
we can establish our own sort of, uh...

24:13.294 --> 24:16.561
industry, so to speak, here,
and maybe help bring it back.

24:16.597 --> 24:18.697
That's kind of the plan and
kind of the hope, you know?

24:18.732 --> 24:20.232
- That's the dream?
- That's the goal.

24:20.267 --> 24:23.969
The Williams kids are
enrolled at Belfry High School.

24:24.005 --> 24:27.706
In spite of significant losses
in enrollment and federal funding,

24:27.741 --> 24:29.841
the school is working
to provide their students

24:29.877 --> 24:32.677
with opportunities
outside the coal mines.

24:32.713 --> 24:34.178
How do you guys feel about coal?

24:34.214 --> 24:35.389
I mean, growing up with it

24:35.390 --> 24:37.315
and seeing the decline of
it over the last few years?

24:37.350 --> 24:39.350
One of our advantages
is disillusionment.

24:39.386 --> 24:42.387
You know, we've always kind
of known what's at stake.

24:42.422 --> 24:45.123
And we've always kind of known
that you need to do good in school

24:45.158 --> 24:47.358
and you need to go to college,
because it's not gonna be there.

24:47.394 --> 24:49.193
Everyone knows how hard it is right now.

24:49.229 --> 24:51.396
All of a sudden, people have
had to shift their life views

24:51.431 --> 24:53.597
from saying, "I'm gonna
be a manual laborer,"

24:53.633 --> 24:55.900
to, "I'm gonna go for
a larger education."

24:55.935 --> 24:57.468
And a lot of people
are scared about that.

24:57.504 --> 25:00.905
You think the value of an
education has increased?

25:00.940 --> 25:03.085
- Because of...
- As the need has increased,

25:03.086 --> 25:04.086
the value has increased.

25:04.096 --> 25:05.674
That's why they've tried
to start new initiatives,

25:05.675 --> 25:06.810
you know, start from scratch.

25:06.846 --> 25:08.145
One of those things is technology.

25:08.180 --> 25:10.781
With no reliable future in coal

25:10.816 --> 25:12.282
for graduating students,

25:12.317 --> 25:15.653
the school has tried to add more
classes in technology and business

25:15.688 --> 25:18.988
that can potentially create
new industries in the region.

25:19.024 --> 25:21.258
So, what is this you're doing here?

25:21.293 --> 25:24.027
Well, what we're doing is we're
3D printing custom foot orthotics

25:24.063 --> 25:26.496
for different foot
disorders like flatfoot.

25:26.532 --> 25:29.999
What we intend to do is get the
prescriptions from the podiatrists

25:30.035 --> 25:33.436
and fill the prescriptions
with a scanner.

25:33.471 --> 25:36.338
We intend to, uh, make
a business out of this.

25:36.374 --> 25:39.375
What do you think the solutions
are when it comes to...

25:39.410 --> 25:41.611
fixing the future for Appalachia?

25:41.646 --> 25:46.015
We need to embrace this change
and not try to freeze the past.

25:46.051 --> 25:48.284
There's no better time in history

25:48.319 --> 25:50.586
to be someone with an idea
that can be encapsulated

25:50.621 --> 25:52.354
in a digital form and replicated,

25:52.390 --> 25:55.324
but that requires a revolution
in our educational system

25:55.359 --> 25:56.959
to transition people there.

25:56.994 --> 25:59.061
While an investment in education

25:59.097 --> 26:01.564
could help save Appalachia's
future generations,

26:01.599 --> 26:04.333
its current workforce is
hoping that a revolution

26:04.368 --> 26:06.768
in entrepreneurship and
technology in the region

26:06.804 --> 26:09.270
could capitalize on
the thousands of people

26:09.306 --> 26:10.939
struggling for jobs today.

26:10.975 --> 26:13.909
Hillbillies coding is like
the Jamaican bobsled team.

26:13.944 --> 26:16.812
It just, it resonates
in people's imagination.

26:16.847 --> 26:19.715
Bit Source founders Rusty
Justice and Lynn Parrish

26:19.750 --> 26:22.984
believe cultivating a tech
industry in Appalachia,

26:23.019 --> 26:25.853
can diversify the economy
and create new jobs.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.556
From an outside perspective,
it's not an obvious fit

26:28.592 --> 26:31.426
to go from working in
a coal mine to coding.

26:31.461 --> 26:35.230
How easy is it to train people who
have worked in coal mines to code?

26:35.265 --> 26:37.132
A lot easier than you might think.

26:38.768 --> 26:41.168
How does this work compare
to your previous work?

26:41.203 --> 26:42.870
You know, something that
you have to understand

26:42.905 --> 26:45.072
is that mining is a high-tech industry.

26:45.108 --> 26:48.509
So, it's not... it's
not a radical transition.

26:48.544 --> 26:49.877
But, you know,

26:49.912 --> 26:51.512
it's also a scary transition,

26:51.547 --> 26:53.814
you know, to go, at my age...

26:53.850 --> 26:55.049
It's a culture shock.

26:55.084 --> 26:58.018
While Bit Source only employs
about ten former miners,

26:58.053 --> 27:01.855
it does show the region is eager to
expand programs in new industries.

27:01.890 --> 27:04.991
We had the idea, then we
thought, "Well, maybe we can find,

27:05.027 --> 27:07.327
you know, 50 folks that will apply.

27:07.363 --> 27:08.828
This is just a theory."

27:08.864 --> 27:10.830
So, we advertised,

27:10.866 --> 27:14.067
and we had 950 applicants for ten jobs.

27:14.102 --> 27:16.936
- Wow.
- Which speaks to the magnitude of the problem.

27:16.972 --> 27:18.938
Emerging start-ups like this

27:18.974 --> 27:21.041
rely on federal funding
through programs like

27:21.076 --> 27:24.177
the Appalachian Regional Commission.

27:24.212 --> 27:25.879
But President Trump has already proposed

27:25.914 --> 27:28.714
to slash these efforts
from his next budget,

27:28.749 --> 27:30.583
leaving it to the people of Appalachia

27:30.618 --> 27:32.785
to move the economy forwards.

27:32.820 --> 27:35.488
The strategy of trying to
go backwards into the past

27:35.523 --> 27:37.523
has never worked for the United States.

27:37.559 --> 27:39.659
The successful strategy has always been

27:39.694 --> 27:42.695
to embrace the future,
embrace new industries.

27:42.730 --> 27:45.530
America has been the
greatest economy in the world,

27:45.566 --> 27:47.199
and we have the potential

27:47.234 --> 27:49.501
to continue to be the greatest economy,

27:49.536 --> 27:52.037
but it really depends
entirely on our choices.
