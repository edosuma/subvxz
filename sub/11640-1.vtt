05:30.831 --> 05:33.391
when we all saw the reflection
of our future selves?

05:33.567 --> 05:37.367
- You mean when you couldn't see anything?
- Yeah, it wasn't because I'm a goner.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.199
It's because I can disappear!

not destroy them.

You'll never be happy if you let the world
define you, you've got to define yourself.

06:39.733 --> 06:44.364

And this time, destroy all the targets.

Have they sold out of Kai action figures?

07:05.592 --> 07:06.753
I knew there wasn't enough.

07:07.027 --> 07:12.488
No. It appears when you destroyed the
Cursed Realm, one ghost escaped.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.191
And you know him all too well, Clouse.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.932

Clouse? The sorcerer from Chen's Island?

07:25.111 --> 07:28.445
What does he want with Stiix?
That place is just a salvage yard now.

That's why I want you to go there and stop
whatever it is he's planning to do.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.287

In and out.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.688
We don't have time.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.126
Technically, we do as long as
we don't encounter any problems.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.992
What does Sensei always say?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.930
Never put off till tomorrow
what can be done today?

Or else we're gonna be spotted.

You should've known the book
was last thrown into a fire.

for more than a pile of ash.
