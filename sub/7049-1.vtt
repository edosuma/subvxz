WEBVTT

00:02.211 --> 00:03.419
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:06.047
This is not what we discussed
on the telephone.

00:06.131 --> 00:09.175
I figure you're good enough that no one
can link the hitters from last night to you.

00:09.259 --> 00:12.470
- Thank you.
- Except, of course, for Gary.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.847
He seems like a bit of a loose end.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.266
I'd leave the country,
but that's entirely up to you.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.852
Are we finished?

00:19.937 --> 00:24.023
As long as you understand that
the next time we have this conversation,

00:24.108 --> 00:25.692
there won't be a conversation.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.736
Devil, you want sugar?

00:30.322 --> 00:31.531
Devil!

00:34.618 --> 00:35.618
Hello, Ava.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.789
It's the top of the first, Raylan.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.083
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter...

00:42.167 --> 00:43.167
Cut him down.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.294
Now, God damn it.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.755
Wait, Raylan! Come on. Listen to me.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.049
You ain't getting to Loretta
without me, and you know it.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.217
Boyd?

00:51.301 --> 00:52.593
He shot Ava.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.387
I'm gonna need him for a little bit.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.473
What, are you asking me
or are you telling me?

00:57.599 --> 00:59.767
Makes you feel better,
you can tell people I asked.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.269
I want you to leave this alone.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.230
I want you to leave it to the authorities.
This is not your problem, Raylan.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.524
I promise you I will be fine.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.484
Okay. Take me to work.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.612
And go to Harlan.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.282
But I can't promise you I'm gonna be here
when you get back.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.076
I need you and your boys
to put your guns down.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.411
And why would we do that?

01:18.495 --> 01:21.330
Maybe you don't want to see
your brother's brains fly through the air.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.332
Guys! Cease fire!

01:54.656 --> 01:56.032
- Was I speeding?
- Winona Hawkins?

01:56.867 --> 01:59.035
- Yeah.
- Ma'am, this is a courtesy stop.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.162
Chief Deputy Art Mullen's
been trying to reach you.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.755
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.881
How is he?

02:12.216 --> 02:14.759
He's sleeping right now,
but he's gonna be all right.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.429
The bullet went right through his side,
just under the ribs.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.056
Didn't hit any vitals.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.892
He's a lucky son of a gun.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.353
Look, Art, I...

02:29.525 --> 02:32.735
End of the hall, Winona.
First door on the left.

03:43.140 --> 03:47.101
I even tried a cross-pull.
I don't think I've done that since Glynco.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.561
How'd that work for you?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.062
Won't be doing it again.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.315
Did you try lefty?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.358
So I could shoot the side of a barn?

03:54.443 --> 03:56.819
All right, we'll try one more week
of medical restriction,

03:56.904 --> 03:59.155
and then I'll issue you some hand grenades.

03:59.615 --> 04:00.781
You're a lucky man, Raylan.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.491
I got shot, Art.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.912
Only thing that saved you was all that
body fat you got going on there.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.663
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.498
Why? We're alone.

04:10.959 --> 04:11.959
Crowder's here.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.178
Didn't wear your suit.

04:22.429 --> 04:26.015
Boy, you say that as if I've only got
the one and not a whole closet full.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.768
I'm sorry. You didn't wear your black suit.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.396
Well, I can see by the hitch
in your step you're still not 100%.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.315
Yeah. How's Ava?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.984
She's moving not so different from you.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.402
She's healing.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.781
So, was I right not to wear my suit?

04:42.324 --> 04:44.033
Well, we don't have a strict dress code.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.744
Well, it just occurred to me that
Raylan Givens invites me up to Lexington,

04:46.828 --> 04:50.373
chances are I might find myself in front
of a judge before the day is out.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.208
Why? Did you do something
you shouldn't have?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.168
Well, that's a pretty low bar, Raylan.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.882
Nah, Trooper Tom Bergen,
up there in your world,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.718
he says within a day of Mags killing herself,

05:02.803 --> 05:05.805
all her marijuana-drying sheds
got cleaned out.

05:05.889 --> 05:09.100
I wasn't aware that marijuana
interdiction fell under the Marshals' purview.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.979
He also said that the floorboards
in the sheds had been torn up,

05:13.105 --> 05:16.315
ceilings pulled down, walls opened up,
like someone was looking for something,

05:16.733 --> 05:21.070
which does fall under the Marshals' purview,
recovering ill-gotten gains.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.031
Mags' bank accounts have been seized
along with her property,

05:24.116 --> 05:26.117
but there's still a sizeable amount
of money missing.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.159
How sizeable, Raylan?

05:27.244 --> 05:28.828
Well over $10.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.374
Well, now, if I found that kind
of money, I'd be in Mexico by now.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.043
Boyd, I've been to Mexico.
I don't think you'd like it.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.169
How so?

05:37.796 --> 05:39.130
There's a lot of Mexicans.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.551
Raylan, if a book could only be judged
by its cover,

05:43.635 --> 05:45.094
you'd be a best seller.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.304
Are we done?

05:47.848 --> 05:48.889
Looks like.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.517
Sorry for wasting your time.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.603
Never a waste of time to spend a moment
with my good friend Raylan Givens.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.107
Tell you what. I'll ask around.
See if I can't get a line on that money for you.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.443
- I appreciate it.
- In exchange for an apology.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.404
I'm sorry. What?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.115
I want you to apologize.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.076
For the crack about the Mexicans?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.371
By the time I got out
to Wade Messer's house,

06:12.456 --> 06:15.875
Dickie Bennett was tuning you up like
it was his birthday and you were his piÃ±ata,

06:15.959 --> 06:18.127
only I don't think there
would have been candy pouring out.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.463
- You're saying you saved my life.
- Are you saying I didn't?

06:20.547 --> 06:24.008
I would suggest what you're looking
for is a "thank you," not an apology.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885
Well, now, follow my logic, Raylan.

06:25.969 --> 06:29.096
I had my own plans for Dickie on account
of his shooting Ava,

06:29.347 --> 06:31.724
but you said you needed him,

06:31.808 --> 06:33.350
so I let you have him under the condition

06:33.435 --> 06:37.438
that you would return him to me
once his services had been rendered.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.783
I'm sorry.
Did you see a creek out in the lobby?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.826
Some pretty green trees
and cut-off mountains?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.661
Do you think we're in the holler?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.497
I am a Deputy US Marshal, Boyd.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.790
You're a Givens, Raylan.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.794
And you think I'm gonna hand a man over
to you to be murdered like he is, what,

06:59.878 --> 07:01.378
some pig I borrowed from you?

07:01.463 --> 07:02.588
You gave me your word.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.923
I got half a mind to kick...

07:06.593 --> 07:08.427
R-A-Y-L-A-N.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.973
Recovering from a GSW.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.476
That stands for "gun..."

07:19.189 --> 07:22.358
No resistance here, Officer!
There's no resistance here!

07:23.360 --> 07:24.401
Hey, Boyd.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.822
Should have wore the suit.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.700
No resistance, Officer! I'll see you, Raylan!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.570
This is great country.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.740
First time, and I already love it here.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.243
The way the pastures roll
off into the distance.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.204
The horses...
I have never seen such beautiful horses.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.081
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:25.881 --> 08:26.881
May I sit?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.549
Please.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.432
Two coffees.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.727
Now, you want a little kick?

08:39.811 --> 08:40.811
Mr. Arnett likes a little kick.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.979
Yeah, he'll have a little kick.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.107
No. He won't. Just black. Thank you.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.152
Thank you, Yvette. You can go now.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.163
You're banging her, aren't you?

08:59.247 --> 09:01.373
- I beg your pardon?
- And now you've lost her respect.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.168
That's hardly your concern.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.836
Well, in a way it is.

09:05.921 --> 09:10.299
See, she's your public face, and she is not
selling the same story as you are.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.476
Who's he?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.770
Mr. Nix is one of my brokers.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.147
Could he sit where I could see him?

09:32.155 --> 09:33.155
That's good.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.744
Now, why don't you state your business,
enjoy your coffee, and then get the hell out?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.288
Detroit is concerned.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.290
Look, when you go back to Detroit,

09:43.375 --> 09:46.835
you just tell them that the properties
that I'm holding are poised to rebound,

09:47.003 --> 09:49.338
and when they do, they're gonna be worth
twice what I paid for them.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.218
So, what do you think they're worth
right now, today?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.553
No, I don't really have a current assessment.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.514
That's okay. 'Cause I do.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.685
You picked a shitty time to get
into commercial real estate,

10:02.769 --> 10:04.228
and now you're underwater.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.355
Detroit did not make an investment, Emmitt.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.234
It made a loan, which you assured them
that you would repay as per the agreement.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.735
250 will bring you current.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.905
I could have that in two weeks.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.533
Emmitt, you read the business pages.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.245
Things are getting tough all over.

10:21.871 --> 10:27.626
So, if you can't have the money here
by tomorrow, I suggest you tell me right now.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.798
I'll have it tomorrow.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.635
That's great.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.721
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.609
Said you were looking for work.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.324
Everybody's been wondering what happened
to all that Bennett weed.

10:58.408 --> 11:02.119
And you get first crack at it,
courtesy of Mr. Boyd Crowder.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.998
Just his way of showing his appreciation
for a new business partner.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.292
Well, let's get to it, then.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.503
There's more in the tractor shed out back.

11:11.588 --> 11:16.425
Lee! Go take a look! A-Ron.
Get over here and help me.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.640
- Devil.
- Yeah?

11:25.769 --> 11:26.769
Ava's here.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.615
- Ava.
- Devil. Arlo throwing a party?

11:41.284 --> 11:45.245
No, we got a buyer for the pot.
Rodney Dunham.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.956
"Hot Rod" Dunham? Out of Memphis?

11:49.292 --> 11:51.877
Now, we're taking care of this, Ava,
me, Arlo, and Johnny.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.920
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.130
- I don't see Johnny.
- Well, he'll turn up.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.298
Yeah?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.802
You figure Boyd's locked up,
you'll just go into business for yourself.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.931
It ain't like that.
Boyd allowed as how he might sell it.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.100
We're just acting on his behalf.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.311
Dunham wants a word.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.729
Tell him to come on out.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.022
Come on out, Dunham.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.316
I got this, Ava.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.654
That smell can really take
the wind right out of you.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.738
Tell me about it.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.032
Mr. Dunham, Ava Crowder.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.576
- I'm proud to know you, ma'am.
- Likewise.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.539
I've seen all I need to see.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.041
Yeah? What's your offer?

12:31.668 --> 12:34.378
All I got to offer is advice.

12:34.838 --> 12:41.427
Next time you want to pull a big score
like this, don't bag the plants wet.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.096
What, is there a problem?

12:45.348 --> 12:47.975
- How long's this been sitting here?
- About three weeks.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.187
You got mold. You got mildew.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.941
You got rats and mice eating on it
out in the shed.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.776
Are you saying it's all gone to shit?

12:58.236 --> 12:59.653
That's not what I'm saying.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.532
I'm saying you can probably
salvage two or three grand

13:03.700 --> 13:05.492
if you get to cleaning right now.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.787
No, this is 120 kilos of premium weed!

13:09.038 --> 13:12.207
Three weeks ago, maybe.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.835
- We were thinking that we might...
- I'm talking to the gentleman.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.462
Let us handle it, Ava.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.924
Now, you as much as told me on the phone
that you was gonna take the whole lot.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.052
I told you I'd look at it.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.181
No, no, no. Here's how it works.

13:28.349 --> 13:32.978
You want to keep buying quality bud,
you gonna have to take all this off our hands.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.438
- Devil!
- Stay out of this!

13:35.523 --> 13:37.733
Pull your head out of your ass, son.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.694
This is serious weight,
and these are dangerous times.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.072
Now, you want this to get ugly? It can.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.159
Of course that's not
what we want, Mr. Dunham.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.411
We appreciate you coming by.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.581
You're lucky I was already in Knoxville.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.417
If I'd come eight hours from Memphis
for this,

13:56.294 --> 13:59.505
I'd be obliged to kick somebody's ass!

14:02.050 --> 14:04.718
Understandable, sir. Thank you.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.095
Ma'am.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.942
That go about the way you expected?

14:20.443 --> 14:22.694
I could use a drink.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.864
Amen to that.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.456
You know you got two and a half bottles
of whiskey on ice and no beer?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.375
That can happen.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.420
Wait. You can't drink any of that shit anyway.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.589
- Well, I can have one.
- Who says?

14:43.132 --> 14:44.383
My mom.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.553
She used to have a couple drinks a night
when she was carrying me.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.389
She'd put her ashtray,
balance it on her great big belly.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.808
- That explains a lot.
- How you doing?

14:53.351 --> 14:54.977
I've been better.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.479
Well, you still look good.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.731
What do you mean, "still"?

14:59.816 --> 15:02.484
You are not getting any younger, kiddo.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.986
I'm so glad you're here.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.532
You ready to get back in action?

15:09.826 --> 15:13.996
Art said another week of light duty,
and that was before the fight.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.373
That's not what I'm talking about.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.673
You okay? Did that hurt?

15:25.174 --> 15:26.550
I'll manage.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.230
So, what's going on?

15:41.566 --> 15:42.566
What are you asking?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.735
I just... It seems like there's something
on your mind.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.492
Do you know about the newborn baby
in the delivery room?

15:53.036 --> 15:56.330
Calls his daddy over and says,
"How do you think that feels?"

15:56.414 --> 15:57.998
Is that what you were thinking about?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.208
Maybe a little.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.378
You know the baby's the size of a walnut
right now, don't you?

16:03.713 --> 16:06.173
You know it's gonna get bigger, too, right?

16:06.257 --> 16:07.716
Well, yeah.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.763
Maybe we need more room.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.725
After all the time I spent redecorating?

16:18.019 --> 16:22.856
Well, much as I appreciate you putting
lipstick on this particular platypus,

16:24.734 --> 16:27.736
maybe we should, I don't know,

16:28.321 --> 16:32.032
start looking for a house or something.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.451
And leave all this?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.554
Yeah?

16:54.722 --> 16:56.431
I got a large olive and eggplant.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.601
Sorry, son, I didn't order a pizza.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.686
I did.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.363
Where would you like me to put them?

17:11.446 --> 17:13.115
Put them on the desk and sit.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.165
These are way nicer
than the piece of shit I wear.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.502
But I'm not complaining. Keeps good time.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.091
You don't remember me, do you?

17:34.011 --> 17:35.721
Never seen you before in my life.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.473
You've seen me. You just didn't notice me.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.394
But I know you. You're Delmer Coates.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.605
You used to own that watch store
over on Clinton.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.692
Couple of kids tried to rob you.

17:49.944 --> 17:53.697
You shot them. Dumbasses didn't
know you had a gun under the counter.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.701
Couple other guys tried after that, right?

17:58.661 --> 18:01.955
- Yeah.
- You shot and killed four men.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.083
You're one tough son of a bitch.

18:05.168 --> 18:08.420
But I come in here and ask you
for the watches, and you just lay down.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.506
Yeah. What was I supposed to do?

18:11.841 --> 18:14.509
I was hoping you'd pull on me,
give me some lip.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.264
You just hit the silent alarm
and wait for the cavalry to come.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.769
I know all about your security system.
I'm the guy who put it in.

18:25.521 --> 18:29.191
When I ordered the pizza,
I took your security system offline.

18:30.234 --> 18:35.030
Took me less than 30 minutes,
which is more than I can say for you, slick.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.409
You understand why I ain't paying
for that pizza, right?

18:40.453 --> 18:43.413
Now, I don't like wearing a mask.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.582
I'm too pretty.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.542
So I am gonna have to kill you.

18:47.627 --> 18:51.213
But I'll tell you what,
there's this game I like to play.

18:51.589 --> 18:56.134
I'm gonna put this gun between us and
have the pizza man count it down from 10.

18:56.219 --> 19:02.224
When he gets to one, we both go for it,
so you got the same chance I got.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.060
That sounds fair, right?

19:08.022 --> 19:09.022
Start counting.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.026
I don't think I should be involved in this.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.110
Count.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.738
- Ten.
- Ten.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.615
Nine.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.243
Eight.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.079
Seven.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.665
Six.

19:29.877 --> 19:30.877
Five.

19:32.922 --> 19:33.922
Four.

19:35.925 --> 19:36.925
Three.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.053
Two.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.055
One.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.271
I win.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.748
I didn't see anything.
I'm not gonna say anything. I swear.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.960
- Are you gonna eat that pizza?
- No! Take it!

20:33.774 --> 20:34.816
What's up?

20:35.276 --> 20:38.904
Somebody killed a Mr. Delmer Coates
last night along with a pizza delivery boy.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.655
They also emptied his safe.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.158
I regret their passing. So?

20:43.784 --> 20:48.204
Well, whoever killed them took
Mr. Coates' security system offline,

20:48.372 --> 20:50.248
- which is not so easy considering...
- I'm gonna stop you there.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.169
Were either Mr. Coates
or the pizza delivery man federal fugitives?

20:54.378 --> 21:00.008
No, but Fletcher "the Ice Pick" Nix is.
He's charged with interstate flight.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.761
The stab wounds on the victim's hands are
consistent with an ice pick.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.722
Can't help you. I'm on light duty.
Maybe Rachel.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.267
Yeah, I'd rather take her, but...

21:09.352 --> 21:10.769
But what?

21:10.853 --> 21:13.521
Wynn Duffy's security system
did the installation.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.776
Is there a question attached to this?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.570
Well, Duffy's the only lead I got,
and I thought you might help me out.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.656
- Why would you think that?
- 'Cause you had that thing.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.408
- Had what thing?
- Where you two killed Gary together.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.412
That's funny. That's funny. Excuse me.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.375
I'm out of staples,
and I'm getting a little light on paper clips.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.918
Come on, man.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.003
"Come on, man."
Have you not been listening?

21:37.088 --> 21:39.839
- I cannot leave my desk.
- Just say you're on lunch.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.800
- I can't talk to Duffy.
- Sure you can.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.051
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.469
Last time I saw him,

21:44.553 --> 21:47.389
I said our next conversation
wasn't gonna be a conversation.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.099
Well, this is a different conversation.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.614
What?

22:05.366 --> 22:07.575
He's not gonna remember
something you said that long ago.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.089
He doesn't want to talk to you.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.590
Well, that makes two of us.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.884
Who don't I want to talk to?

22:28.139 --> 22:29.347
Raylan.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.396
To what do I owe the pleasure?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.441
Deputy Gutterson has some questions
for you.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.862
Gentleman named Delmer Coates
was murdered last night.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.321
- Name ring a bell?
- Not offhand.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.364
Should it?

22:46.449 --> 22:48.450
Well, you installed his security system
about two years ago.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.535
It was a Whispertech Series C.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.245
That's a good system.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.581
Whoever killed Coates disabled it first.

22:54.665 --> 22:57.542
- Since you install so many of them...
- I'm sorry, I just have to ask.

22:57.626 --> 23:01.087
Are you two accusing me of being involved
or are you just asking me for information?

23:01.255 --> 23:02.714
Whichever applies.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.007
I don't think it'd be very good for business

23:04.091 --> 23:06.593
if I went around murdering
my own clients, do you?

23:06.761 --> 23:09.554
Well, it might be worth it if they had
a safe full of expensive merchandise.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.806
All my clients have expensive merchandise.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.683
That's why they buy security sys...

23:13.768 --> 23:15.560
Just answer the question,
or shut your mouth.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.521
I can only imagine how frustrating
this must be for you, Raylan.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.441
It'd be so much easier to just beat
a confession out of me, wouldn't it?

23:21.525 --> 23:22.650
That's still an option.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.986
As a matter of fact, as I recall,
last time we met,

23:25.154 --> 23:28.865
you told me next conversation we had
wasn't gonna be a conversation.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.951
This is a different conversation.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.081
You ever hire an installer
named Fletcher Nix?

23:36.207 --> 23:38.333
Favorite toy's an ice pick.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.085
That's not exactly standard equipment.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.586
That ain't exactly an answer.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.339
Raylan, I am so sorry.
I would love to be of more help,

23:44.423 --> 23:47.092
but I got to get back
to watching women's tennis.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.636
Close the door, Mike.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.603
Well, the man's a piece of shit,
but I believe him.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.646
You do?

23:59.730 --> 24:01.439
He didn't flinch
when you mentioned Delmer Coates.

24:01.524 --> 24:02.857
No, but when I mentioned that ice pick...

24:02.942 --> 24:04.234
Yeah, he flinched a little.

24:04.318 --> 24:07.821
Well, maybe this one's above his pay grade.
Who's he work for?

24:07.988 --> 24:11.157
Emmitt Arnett. Dixie Mafia shot-caller
out of Frankfort.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.536
Okay, how about you go talk to him?
You drop me off at the corner.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.538
- I'll keep an eye on Duffy.
- Excuse me?

24:16.622 --> 24:19.749
Or, you know, you can go back
to the office, get your paper clips,

24:19.834 --> 24:22.627
do the p-p dance,
whatever makes you feel happy, Raylan.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.684
Emmitt, is there anything you want
to tell me?

24:37.768 --> 24:39.727
<i>What is this, 20 Questions?</i>

24:39.937 --> 24:42.856
<i>You hired one of my own guys
to go after one of my clients?</i>

24:42.982 --> 24:44.065
Where'd you get that idea?

24:44.316 --> 24:47.485
Don't insult my intelligence, Emmitt!
I'm talking about Fletcher, the Ice Pick.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.573
Hey, baby?
Baby, pull that door a minute, will you?

24:54.368 --> 24:56.828
I didn't think he was still one of your boys.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.288
<i>He isn't one of my boys. Do you know why?</i>

24:58.414 --> 24:59.581
Because he's a federal fugitive,

24:59.665 --> 25:02.417
which means that anything he does points
right back at me.

25:02.585 --> 25:06.087
<i>Which raises the obvious question,
was that your intention, Emmitt?</i>

25:06.172 --> 25:10.216
No! No, look. It didn't go as planned.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.927
I'm on my way into the office to meet him,
and that'll be the end of it.

25:13.596 --> 25:14.637
Well, let me know how that goes.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.931
And, by the way, Raylan Givens is
on his way to talk to you.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.642
Damn.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.607
It sure is good to see you.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.318
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.486
How are you?

25:31.614 --> 25:34.199
Well, it sucks talking to you
through this glass.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.660
They're transferring me to Trimble.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.454
Everything okay?

25:44.710 --> 25:47.879
You know that cord of wood we got stacked
behind Arlo's house?

25:48.130 --> 25:50.381
I thought maybe we could sell some.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.344
Yeah, but your old buddy from Memphis
came by, said he couldn't use any of it.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.179
Not a piece?

25:57.473 --> 25:58.973
He said it was starting to rot.

25:59.058 --> 26:03.144
Didn't seem to have any good ideas about
what we should do with it, either.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.774
Well, burn it.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.863
- All of it?
- All of it.

26:14.365 --> 26:18.076
I wouldn't want to attract any termites
or any other pests.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.056
Yeah? What's the problem?

26:42.017 --> 26:43.017
Yeah.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.940
Small world. I'll tell you later.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.442
You want me to handle it?

26:52.736 --> 26:54.946
All right. Have it your way.

27:04.581 --> 27:05.707
Something I can help you with?

27:06.875 --> 27:08.501
I like your hat.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.224
There much call for cowboys these days?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.895
- You would be surprised.
- Yeah?

27:28.772 --> 27:29.772
Yep.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.738
Hey. It's not your floor.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.407
Change of plan. See you again.

27:45.622 --> 27:46.831
Emmitt?

27:47.499 --> 27:50.460
Marshal! I didn't hear you come in.

27:50.753 --> 27:53.004
Sorry. Looking for Mr. Arnett.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.756
He won't be coming in today.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.634
You know where I can find him?

27:58.719 --> 28:00.094
I can try to find out.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.097
Or maybe there's something I can do for you.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.269
- My daddy had a hat kind of like yours.
- Yeah?

28:08.604 --> 28:10.063
Except the brim was smaller.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.731
Businessman's Stetson.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.149
That's it.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.402
Can I be honest with you?

28:17.613 --> 28:19.447
I'd like to think so.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.284
I don't think Mr. Arnett's
in the real-estate business.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.952
What makes you say that?

28:25.037 --> 28:27.330
Mostly just the people who come around.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.957
I mean, they don't look like real-estate folks.

28:30.042 --> 28:34.670
They don't even look like contractors, or
property managers or maintenance people.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.590
- They're just sketchy.
- Like Wynn Duffy.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.302
Exactly! And this new guy, Fletcher Nix.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.888
He is super creepy.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.224
What do you know about him?

28:46.308 --> 28:50.311
Nothing. Except he was supposed to come
into the office this morning for a meeting,

28:50.396 --> 28:52.063
but Mr. Arnett canceled at the last minute.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.731
Why'd he cancel?

28:55.025 --> 28:57.276
- They rescheduled.
- Rescheduled for?

28:57.486 --> 28:59.028
Can I just say

28:59.738 --> 29:03.950
it is so nice talking to a man
who's interested in what you have to say.

29:05.119 --> 29:10.581
I mean, none of Mr. Arnett's colleagues are
very good conversationalists,

29:10.666 --> 29:11.666
to say the least.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.543
Must be difficult.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.880
- They rescheduled for?
- Tonight.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.633
But I don't have to be there.
Thank goodness.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.303
Do you know where?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.307
Near a cab stand at Jefferson and Main.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.313
Yvette, may I offer you some advice?

29:34.815 --> 29:37.400
Quit. The sooner, the better.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.821
I got a feeling Mr. Arnett's
about to ride a barrel over the falls.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.326
I wish you could see it, buddy.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.912
Hey, you know how they talk
about Kentucky bluegrass?

29:49.997 --> 29:51.581
Well, it's actually blue.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.959
I did. I sent you a postcard this morning.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.336
No, I wouldn't kid you about that.

29:57.421 --> 30:00.506
You'll see for yourself as soon
as I get settled.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.969
Hey, look, Pop's got to go.
I love you, buddy. Bye.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.348
- How'd that go?
- Just like you said it would.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.310
You tell him about tonight?

30:12.644 --> 30:13.978
But that's what I don't get.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.732
If they catch Fletcher before he makes
the drop, you don't get the money.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.568
Well, I'm not so worried
about the money anymore.

30:20.903 --> 30:23.362
Then what'd you come all this way for?

30:24.490 --> 30:25.656
I like the scenery.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.925
- This is Fletcher Nix?
- Didn't you look at his file?

30:44.009 --> 30:46.385
- Not closely.
- There a problem?

30:47.930 --> 30:51.182
Okay, Rachel, I want you
to call the LPD shift captain.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.934
Make sure he has all our info.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.561
Tim, you call the SWAT team leader
and do the same.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.648
Now, we're gonna need a photograph
of Emmitt Arnett.

30:59.066 --> 31:02.068
Something better than a driver's license
would be a big plus.

31:02.653 --> 31:05.196
Hopefully, we can get Arnett
and Fletcher Nix together tonight,

31:05.280 --> 31:07.031
and it'll be one-stop shopping.

31:07.449 --> 31:08.908
All right.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.495
You ain't gonna let me do anything, are you?

31:12.579 --> 31:15.122
Well, you can't run and you can't shoot.
What good are you?

31:15.207 --> 31:18.209
Well, I can be the guy on the radio,
telling people what to do.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.254
That's my job, asshole.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.716
- But, Art...
- Not changing my mind.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.802
No, no, no.
There's something else you should know.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.886
Okay.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.764
Tim showed me a picture of Nix this morning,
but I didn't look at it.

31:31.848 --> 31:32.848
Is that it?

31:32.933 --> 31:35.184
And then I ran into him later
in the elevator at Arnett's,

31:35.269 --> 31:36.602
but I didn't recognize him.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.104
Because you didn't look at the picture.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.856
'Cause you've been shot,
and you're off your game,

31:40.941 --> 31:43.150
which is why I told you to stay at your desk.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.069
So the next time I tell you
to stay at your desk...

31:45.153 --> 31:46.904
- I'm gonna stay at my desk.
- Thank you.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.365
- But this thing tonight...
- Yes?

31:51.702 --> 31:54.870
It might have come too easy,
the information I got from Yvette.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.497
I didn't have to work hard for it.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.875
Anything else you screwed up today?

32:01.295 --> 32:02.587
Not that I can think of.

32:03.005 --> 32:06.048
Go home, Raylan, really. We'll be fine.

32:11.513 --> 32:14.557
You sure do have some fine cookware,
Mr. Givens.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.310
Most of it was Helen's.

32:17.394 --> 32:20.479
Some from her sister.
They both liked to cook.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.189
As do I.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.609
Ava?

32:25.527 --> 32:28.613
While we appreciate
you making this fine meal,

32:28.697 --> 32:34.493
I think we would appreciate it even more
if you told us what Boyd had to say.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.705
Yeah, why you stalling?

32:38.707 --> 32:41.542
Well, you got me, Devil. I am stalling.

32:42.461 --> 32:46.714
I just wanted to get some good food
in you before I relayed Boyd's orders.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.345
Boyd instructed that you burn the weed.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.723
- The hell?
- That weed's worth 100 grand easy.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.727
It's also worth 20 years
any law enforcement happens by.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.271
Hot Rod was our last outlet.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.649
We can't just sit on it and hope we run
into someone

33:04.733 --> 33:06.233
who will take it off our hands.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.362
We ain't burning it.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.657
Those were Boyd's orders.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.743
Yeah, well, Boyd's not here, is he?

33:19.373 --> 33:23.959
Devil, I can imagine it is hard
taking orders from a woman.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.587
Only you're not.
You're taking orders from Boyd.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.339
I'm just passing it along.

33:30.676 --> 33:36.055
Now, the way I figure it is you got a choice.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.600
We can play nice.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.979
You do what Boyd says,
and I keep cooking my fine food.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.315
My fried chicken is to die for.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.734
The other path?

33:49.820 --> 33:52.780
You ignore Boyd, and I get ornery.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.536
Well, what are you gonna do?
Spit in our food?

34:05.168 --> 34:08.963
We clear? I need to make my point
any more emphatically?

34:09.464 --> 34:11.799
You didn't need to do that, Ava.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.260
Of course I did, Mr. Givens.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.262
Otherwise I wouldn't have done it.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.214
Male, 40s, approaching the Escalade,
holding a box.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.675
- Fletcher Nix?
- Negative.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.220
<i>Not, repeat, not Fletcher Nix.</i>

35:03.435 --> 35:05.436
You're supposed to give me something
for this.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.105
How about you get in the car,
or I shoot you in the face.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.566
- Driver's got a gun.
- All right, shut it down!

35:11.109 --> 35:12.610
Get in the goddamn car.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.375
Take him down!

35:32.923 --> 35:36.634
Keep your hands in the air! Keep your
hands where I can see them at all times!

35:36.927 --> 35:38.594
Get out of the car.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.680
Put your hands on your head.

35:41.765 --> 35:44.558
Turn around. Kneel down.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.811
Get down on your knees.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.369
I've always thought Felix
deserved a comeback.

36:03.537 --> 36:05.746
Felix, Felix Givens.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.082
- Like Felix the Cat.
- Yeah, but without the cat.

36:09.251 --> 36:12.461
Just Felix. What do you think?

36:13.213 --> 36:14.588
Yeah, maybe.

36:15.757 --> 36:16.757
Maybe?

36:17.175 --> 36:20.845
Raylan, I think it's sweet that
you think you have a say in the name.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.012
I'm sorry?

36:22.097 --> 36:26.308
Well, I do know you, and I know that
if I spend more than five minutes in labor,

36:26.434 --> 36:27.685
sweating and screaming and all of that,

36:27.769 --> 36:29.353
you're gonna go
with whatever name I choose.

36:29.437 --> 36:35.276
I mean, I could...
I could choose Jiffy Pop or Palmolive.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.444
That's a good one.

36:38.238 --> 36:40.114
- Jiffy Pop.
- Jiffy Pop.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.907
Jiffy Pop for a boy.

36:41.992 --> 36:45.035
- Palmolive's obviously...
- Obviously a girl's name. Obviously.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
What's up, Art?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.581
<i>- How'd it go?</i>
- Not well.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.166
Fletcher Nix was a no-show, as was Arnett.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.544
Nix sent some homeless guy to do the drop,

36:53.628 --> 36:56.422
and Arnett sent some guy
that might have been a bodyguard,

36:56.506 --> 36:59.133
but we don't know now
because he's all lawyered up.

36:59.634 --> 37:03.137
I thought the homeless guy was gonna
get popped, so I shut it down.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.221
What's next?

37:04.389 --> 37:07.975
Frankfort PD's on the way to Arnett's house
to bring him in for questioning.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.876
- Who are you?
- I'm the one with the gun.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.962
This has nothing to do with the lady.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.258
That's too bad. Come inside. Shut the door.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.768
Now I ask you to take your gun out.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.187
I think you'd do it, considering the company.

37:59.361 --> 38:00.694
Slowly.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.280
Just take two fingers, and...

38:03.573 --> 38:08.369
You know what? Just do whatever you'd
tell someone to do in a situation like this.

38:14.084 --> 38:15.793
Whole thing.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.628
Put it on the ground.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.391
Have a seat.

38:41.611 --> 38:42.903
Okay.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.823
What's next, Fletcher?

38:45.907 --> 38:48.409
You're showing me you know my name.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.161
I know a lot about you.

38:51.246 --> 38:52.705
You didn't know me in the elevator.

38:54.874 --> 38:59.461
What I still don't get is why you don't
just take the money and run.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.840
Maybe because it's not money.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.012
Watches.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.682
I look like I know anything about watches?

39:13.977 --> 39:16.520
Hell, I could take those off your hands.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.815
Give you 20 apiece for them.
You can be on your way.

39:26.281 --> 39:30.492
You're the one who put that plug
in Tommy Bucks on that Miami rooftop.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.203
That's right.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.250
How about we play a game?

39:40.295 --> 39:41.920
Count down from 10.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.927
Go ahead, Winona.

39:52.807 --> 39:53.807
Right now?

39:53.892 --> 39:55.350
This is as good a time as any.

40:04.861 --> 40:05.861
Ten.

40:08.823 --> 40:09.823
Nine.

40:12.327 --> 40:13.327
Eight.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.538
Seven.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.002
Six.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.172
When she gets to one, we go for it.

40:28.968 --> 40:29.968
Five.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.014
Four.

40:35.850 --> 40:36.850
Three.

40:38.728 --> 40:39.728
Two.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.531
I'm sorry about your tablecloth.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.661
- Is that really necessary?
- I don't know him.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.291
He'll be here. He'll be here. Don't worry.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.709
No, he won't.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.921
He probably just stopped
for a sandwich or something.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.756
That boy just can't stop eating.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.967
Actually, you know, it's a problem.

41:10.552 --> 41:12.803
Mr. Arnett, he's not coming.

41:14.556 --> 41:17.808
I had your assistant, Yvette, tell the Marshals
where the exchange was happening.

41:25.942 --> 41:26.942
You're funny.

41:31.281 --> 41:32.823
I'm not joking.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.164
Why would you do that?

41:40.248 --> 41:41.915
You had a good thing going here, Emmitt.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.251
But you let go of the rope.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.510
You done?

41:54.470 --> 41:55.679
Almost.

42:13.281 --> 42:14.448
You know me now?

42:16.534 --> 42:17.618
Yeah.

42:31.758 --> 42:34.384
I don't know if you're thinking of it,
but stay away from the neck.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.387
Now, back here's okay, but up here?

42:37.472 --> 42:40.140
Hurts like a son of a bitch,
and don't mind my saying.

42:40.225 --> 42:43.143
I think it might be because the skin is looser
or something.

42:43.269 --> 42:46.021
Yeah, no, no, thank you. I don't...

42:46.147 --> 42:47.606
I don't plan on getting no tattoos.

42:47.690 --> 42:50.609
Well, man, neither did I,
but, as much as anything else,

42:50.693 --> 42:52.361
it gives you something to do, you know?

42:52.528 --> 42:54.279
You can only spank it so much.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.410
What the hell's he doing here.
