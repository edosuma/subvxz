<b>It is effective for concealing your presence,</b>

02:31.710 --> 02:34.440
<b>Will he be able to win the match?</b>

02:36.340 --> 02:37.300
<b>Critical!</b>

02:37.300 --> 02:38.670
<b>Two points for Gon!</b>

02:39.410 --> 02:44.180
<b>Amazing! Gon managed 
to land a critical hit!</b>

02:44.570 --> 02:47.590
<b>He's come back to take a 2-1 lead.</b>

02:47.590 --> 02:49.310
<b>Gon is on top!</b>

02:51.690 --> 02:53.450
<b>However,</b>

02:53.450 --> 02:58.320
<b>it appears that his punch hasn't 
dealt much damage to Hisoka.</b>

02:58.600 --> 03:01.570
<b>I have to question the referee's decision...</b>

03:02.790 --> 03:06.580
<b>The referee is entitled to award 
points as he pleases.</b>

03:07.710 --> 03:08.660
<b>Huh?</b>

03:08.660 --> 03:12.440
<b>Some referees award points based 
on the amount of damage done,</b>

03:12.440 --> 03:15.380
<b>while some base scores on 
strategy and technique.</b>

03:16.220 --> 03:20.250
<b>I believe the referee in this case 
was rewarding the fighter for</b>

03:20.250 --> 03:23.340
<b>using the stone block in his attack.</b>

03:23.720 --> 03:25.190
<b>I see...</b>

03:26.040 --> 03:28.420
<b>So, who are you?</b>

03:29.580 --> 03:30.600
<b><i>Okay!</i></b>

03:39.160 --> 03:41.490
<b>O-Oh...</b>

03:41.960 --> 03:45.060
<b>For the first time in this fight, 
Hisoka has moved!</b>

03:45.060 --> 03:47.760
<b>And he's smiling ever so slightly.</b>

03:48.920 --> 03:52.250
<b>Is he finally getting serious?</b>

04:24.200 --> 04:26.260
<b>What was that about?!</b>

04:26.260 --> 04:27.530
<b>I have no idea!</b>

04:36.580 --> 04:38.170
<b>How much have you learned</b>

04:38.170 --> 04:40.050
<b>about <i>Nen</i>?</b>

04:41.270 --> 04:43.050
<b>All of the basics.</b>

04:43.340 --> 04:44.540
<b>I see.</b>

04:44.540 --> 04:46.520
<b>You must be an Enhancer.</b>

04:47.320 --> 04:49.210
<b>H-How did you know?</b>

04:51.120 --> 04:53.220
<b>You're so adorable...</b>

04:53.220 --> 04:56.070
<b>You should do a better job 
of keeping a secret.</b>

04:57.220 --> 04:58.390
<b>Shut up!</b>

04:58.390 --> 05:00.070
<b>How did you know?</b>

05:00.070 --> 05:03.290
<b>I used a method similar to the 
blood type personality test.</b>

05:03.290 --> 05:05.240
<b>And it's just as unreliable.</b>

05:05.750 --> 05:09.580
<b>I devised my own way of using 
personality to classify aura.</b>

05:12.510 --> 05:15.030
<b>Enhancers are simple and earnest.</b>

05:15.820 --> 05:16.710
<b><i>He nailed it.</i></b>

05:17.180 --> 05:18.460
<b><i>He's right.</i></b>

05:19.780 --> 05:22.520
<b>By the way, I'm a Transmuter,</b>

05:22.520 --> 05:24.210
<b>fickle and dishonest.</b>

05:24.210 --> 05:25.470
<b><i>It fits.</i></b>

05:25.470 --> 05:26.590
<b><i>He nailed it.</i></b>

05:27.690 --> 05:29.970
<b>Emitters have short tempers.</b>

05:29.970 --> 05:32.650
<b>Specialists are independent.</b>

05:32.650 --> 05:34.940
<b>Conjurers are high-strung.</b>

05:35.480 --> 05:37.860
<b>Manipulators are argumentative.</b>

05:38.670 --> 05:41.300
<b>The two of us are quite compatible.</b>

05:41.300 --> 05:44.040
<b>Our opposing personalities attract.</b>

05:45.060 --> 05:47.860
<b>We could become very intimate.</b>

05:48.330 --> 05:53.240
<b>But you should take care, 
because Transmuters are fickle.</b>

05:53.650 --> 05:57.750
<b>It takes a mere second for 
treasure to turn to trash.</b>

06:03.300 --> 06:04.510
<b>So...</b>

06:10.370 --> 06:14.010
<b>Do not disappoint me, Gon.</b>

06:22.690 --> 06:23.440
<b>He's fast!</b>

06:37.140 --> 06:40.180
<b>Wh-What a strong kick.</b>

06:40.180 --> 06:43.590
<b>He sent that stone block flying 
all the way to the entrance!</b>

07:22.000 --> 07:24.180
<b>Fast, fast, fast!</b>

07:24.180 --> 07:26.810
<b>Hisoka is demonstrating his true power.</b>

07:27.690 --> 07:28.960
<b>Critical for Hisoka!</b>

07:28.960 --> 07:30.130
<b>Add points.</b>

07:30.130 --> 07:31.260
<b>3-2!</b>

07:31.650 --> 07:33.840
<b>His nonstop flurry of attacks has been scored</b>

07:33.840 --> 07:35.460
<b>as a critical strike.</b>

07:35.460 --> 07:37.770
<b>He's regained the lead.</b>

07:42.250 --> 07:43.820
<b>Gon appears to be confused...</b>

07:43.820 --> 07:45.360
<b>Does he have no way to fight back?</b>

07:45.360 --> 07:47.270
<b>He's backing off.</b>

07:48.680 --> 07:49.870
<b><i>Amazing...</i></b>

07:49.870 --> 07:51.280
<b><i>Too amazing.</i></b>

07:53.950 --> 07:55.580
<b>What's wrong?</b>

07:55.580 --> 07:57.230
<b>Attack me.</b>

07:57.230 --> 07:59.540
<b>Forget it. 
I'm brainstorming!</b>

08:06.210 --> 08:09.300
<b><i>I can just barely follow him by eye,</i></b>

08:09.300 --> 08:11.320
<b><i>but the rest of my body can't keep up.</i></b>

08:11.320 --> 08:14.050
<b><i>At this rate, he'll beat the crap out of me!</i></b>

08:14.810 --> 08:15.970
<b>Very well.</b>

08:15.970 --> 08:20.310
<b>Then I'll have to force you 
to come over here...</b>

08:25.940 --> 08:27.560
<b>Gon, use <i>Gyo</i> !</b>

08:30.200 --> 08:31.070
<b><i>Crap!</i></b>

08:39.870 --> 08:41.700
<b>Do you understand</b>

08:42.440 --> 08:44.080
<b>what is happening?</b>

09:00.920 --> 09:04.180
<b>Gon has been drawn toward Hisoka!</b>

09:24.670 --> 09:28.120
<b><i>This is my Elastic Love...</i></b>

09:28.120 --> 09:30.250
<b><i>Also known as Bungee Gum.</i></b>

09:30.660 --> 09:34.260
<b><i>It can expand and contract.</i></b>

09:34.690 --> 09:39.010
<b><i>And attach and detach as I desire...</i></b>

09:44.400 --> 09:46.980
<b>You won't be able to escape.</b>

09:56.870 --> 09:58.980
<b>Critical and down.</b>

09:58.980 --> 10:00.860
<b>Plus three points to Hisoka.</b>

10:00.860 --> 10:02.080
<b>6-2!</b>

10:05.340 --> 10:08.910
<b>Hisoka hits him with a strong straight right!</b>

10:08.910 --> 10:10.330
<b>Gon is down!</b>

10:10.880 --> 10:13.110
<b><i>He turns his aura into a rubbery substance</i></b>

10:13.110 --> 10:15.090
<b><i>capable of attaching to other objects.</i></b>

10:15.090 --> 10:16.590
<b><i>Bungee Gum.</i></b>

10:17.000 --> 10:17.850
<b><i>Tsk.</i></b>

10:17.850 --> 10:20.340
<b><i>Only Hisoka can attach and detach it.</i></b>

10:20.680 --> 10:23.350
<b>Stand up, Gon...</b>

10:24.780 --> 10:25.600
<b>Damn.</b>

10:26.030 --> 10:27.330
<b>The score is 6-2.</b>

10:27.330 --> 10:29.580
<b>Hisoka increases his lead.</b>

10:29.580 --> 10:33.360
<b>Will his undefeated record continue?</b>

10:33.720 --> 10:34.780
<b>Stand up, kid!</b>

10:34.780 --> 10:37.240
<b>Hey, ref! You're helping Hisoka too much!</b>

10:37.240 --> 10:38.270
<b>You can do it!</b>

10:39.450 --> 10:40.400
<b>Can you fight?</b>

10:40.400 --> 10:41.640
<b>Of course.</b>

10:44.430 --> 10:47.310
<b>Oh, Gon is standing...</b>

10:47.310 --> 10:50.270
<b>But he's sustained significant damage!</b>

10:50.270 --> 10:52.580
<b>Okay, I have a question for you.</b>

10:52.580 --> 10:53.090
<b>Huh?</b>

10:53.560 --> 10:57.090
<b>If you answer correctly, I'll give you a free hit.</b>

10:57.090 --> 10:58.340
<b>What?</b>

10:58.870 --> 11:03.850
<b>When did I attach my Bungee Gum to your cheek?</b>

11:03.850 --> 11:06.190
<b><i>When did he attach his Gum?</i></b>

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
<b>One...</b>

11:07.990 --> 11:09.600
<b>When I elbowed you.</b>

11:09.950 --> 11:10.830
<b>Two...</b>

11:10.830 --> 11:12.710
<b>When I landed a clean hit.</b>

11:13.430 --> 11:14.330
<b>Three...</b>

11:14.330 --> 11:16.110
<b>When I landed a critical strike?</b>

11:17.790 --> 11:18.610
<b><i>When was it?</i></b>

11:21.540 --> 11:24.370
<b>Three! When you hit me with both hands!</b>

11:24.760 --> 11:26.490
<b>Wrong!</b>

11:26.490 --> 11:27.870
<b>The answer is four.</b>

11:28.710 --> 11:33.210
<b>When I was giving you my 
aura personality analysis.</b>

11:34.290 --> 11:35.380
<b><i>That's dirty!</i></b>

11:40.670 --> 11:41.890
<b><i>Damn.</i></b>

11:41.890 --> 11:45.140
<b><i>If I had been using Gyo from the beginning...</i></b>

11:47.250 --> 11:50.510
<b>Now, I have a warning for you.</b>

11:51.360 --> 11:53.900
<b>Had you been using <i>Gyo</i>,</b>

11:53.900 --> 11:58.010
<b>you would have been able to notice my aura,</b>

11:58.010 --> 12:01.020
<b>and you could have avoided it</b>

12:01.020 --> 12:03.410
<b>during my aura personality analysis.</b>

12:05.520 --> 12:09.160
<b>However, what about situations 
one, two, and three?</b>

12:14.030 --> 12:16.100
<b>Have you figured it out?</b>

12:16.100 --> 12:18.650
<b>I could have also attached my Bungee Gum</b>

12:18.650 --> 12:21.170
<b>while directly attacking you.</b>

12:21.880 --> 12:26.540
<b>You only need to conceal your aura when you 
wish to catch your opponent off guard.</b>

12:27.220 --> 12:30.810
<b>Normally, you use your aura while attacking.</b>

12:31.610 --> 12:35.240
<b>It doesn't matter if your 
opponent sees your aura</b>

12:35.240 --> 12:36.940
<b>when you're landing attacks.</b>

12:37.580 --> 12:38.950
<b><i>He's right.</i></b>

12:38.950 --> 12:41.350
<b><i>If I can't dodge Hisoka's attacks,</i></b>

12:41.350 --> 12:44.630
<b><i>using Gyo to see his aura won't help!</i></b>

12:45.820 --> 12:47.290
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

12:47.290 --> 12:50.450
<b><i>His power's far more difficult to 
handle than I expected!</i></b>

12:51.440 --> 12:54.260
<b>So you have to dodge all of Hisoka's attacks</b>

12:54.260 --> 12:58.170
<b>if you want to avoid his Bungee Gum.</b>

12:59.030 --> 13:00.710
<b>But if you're able to defend...</b>

13:01.140 --> 13:03.310
<b>No, defending won't work.</b>

13:03.610 --> 13:06.470
<b>Even if you block, he can still attach 
his aura to the part you block with.</b>

13:09.650 --> 13:11.240
<b><i>I can't escape.</i></b>

13:12.540 --> 13:13.810
<b><i>What should I do?</i></b>

13:15.410 --> 13:18.050
<b>Okay, that's enough talk.</b>

13:18.050 --> 13:20.980
<b>Let us prepare for battle.</b>

13:21.900 --> 13:22.990
<b>Resume.</b>

13:30.290 --> 13:31.990
<b><i>If I can't escape,</i></b>

13:33.270 --> 13:34.750
<b><i>I'll go to him!</i></b>

13:41.490 --> 13:42.250
<b><i>Gon...</i></b>

13:42.900 --> 13:43.880
<b><i>Gon!</i></b>

13:46.660 --> 13:48.190
<b><i>Good...</i></b>

13:48.190 --> 13:50.510
<b><i>You're so good.</i></b>

13:50.810 --> 13:52.010
<b><i>Those eyes.</i></b>

13:52.010 --> 13:53.770
<b><i>That look.</i></b>

13:53.770 --> 13:56.020
<b><i>That spirit...</i></b>

14:03.220 --> 14:07.280
<b><i>I can't wait</i></b>

14:07.280 --> 14:09.030
<b><i>to break you.</i></b>

14:17.650 --> 14:19.540
<b><i>But not yet...</i></b>

14:24.250 --> 14:25.490
<b><i>More...</i></b>

14:25.490 --> 14:26.800
<b><i>More!</i></b>

14:27.210 --> 14:29.930
<b><i>Until I can no longer bear to ruin you.</i></b>

14:30.300 --> 14:32.050
<b>Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!</b>

14:33.110 --> 14:34.810
<b><i>Once you've matured...</i></b>

14:34.810 --> 14:36.520
<b>Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!</b>

14:37.140 --> 14:39.520
<b><i>Until you've reached soaring new heights...</i></b>

14:40.730 --> 14:41.730
<b><i>I must wait.</i></b>

14:41.730 --> 14:44.010
<b>A vicious rush!</b>

14:49.380 --> 14:51.900
<b>Oh, not again!</b>

14:51.900 --> 14:56.250
<b>Hisoka draws Gon into another 
punch from his left fist!</b>

15:05.520 --> 15:06.510
<b><i>Good.</i></b>

15:06.510 --> 15:08.280
<b><i>I managed to block that!</i></b>

15:09.760 --> 15:13.690
<b><i>I'm getting used to being dragged 
around by his Bungee Gum.</i></b>

15:14.260 --> 15:15.180
<b><i>This isn't over.</i></b>

15:15.180 --> 15:16.560
<b><i>It's not over yet!</i></b>

15:19.860 --> 15:21.130
<b><i>I'm scared...</i></b>

15:22.400 --> 15:24.770
<b><i>But if I let my fear overcome me,</i></b>

15:25.230 --> 15:28.740
<b><i>I'll never be able to beat anyone else!</i></b>

15:30.110 --> 15:31.710
<b>Critical for both sides!</b>

15:31.710 --> 15:32.990
<b>Plus two points!</b>

15:33.410 --> 15:35.980
<b>Plus a knockdown for Hisoka!</b>

15:35.980 --> 15:36.740
<b>What?</b>

15:36.740 --> 15:39.750
<b>Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka, 
and 4 points for Gon!</b>

15:40.050 --> 15:41.200
<b>I was never knocked down!</b>

15:41.200 --> 15:42.170
<b>I got right back up!</b>

15:42.170 --> 15:43.250
<b>I even blocked his attack!</b>

15:43.250 --> 15:44.240
<b>What?</b>

15:44.240 --> 15:45.810
<b>Something's wrong with this ref!</b>

15:45.810 --> 15:48.000
<b>Are you blind?</b>

15:48.500 --> 15:51.900
<b>Oh, we have another strange call.</b>

15:51.900 --> 15:54.340
<b>In response to the ref's decision,</b>

15:54.340 --> 15:56.620
<b>the crowd has filled the arena with boos.</b>

15:57.320 --> 15:58.210
<b>Fight!</b>

16:03.110 --> 16:05.340
<b><i>If he gets ten points, I lose.</i></b>

16:05.340 --> 16:06.770
<b><i>I only have one point left.</i></b>

16:07.970 --> 16:09.280
<b><i>He doesn't need to knock me down.</i></b>

16:09.280 --> 16:12.530
<b><i>If I get hit by any attack, it's over!</i></b>

16:14.060 --> 16:16.280
<b>You must be more vigilant, Gon.</b>

16:17.230 --> 16:19.160
<b>Look to the right.</b>

16:30.220 --> 16:31.700
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

16:31.700 --> 16:34.080
<b>I meant my right.</b>

16:37.710 --> 16:40.390
<b>Down, and clean hit!</b>

16:40.830 --> 16:42.220
<b>Plus two points.</b>

16:42.220 --> 16:43.390
<b>11-4.</b>

16:43.810 --> 16:45.400
<b>The winner, by, TKO, is...</b>

16:46.900 --> 16:48.200
<b>Hisoka!</b>

16:49.180 --> 16:50.130
<b>Huh?</b>

17:04.950 --> 17:08.290
<b>While you were complaining to the referee,</b>

17:08.290 --> 17:11.130
<b>I sent the aura on my left hand to the stone.</b>

17:11.990 --> 17:15.130
<b><i>Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka, 
and 4 points for Gon!</i></b>

17:18.390 --> 17:22.930
<b>Then I immediately activated Bungee Gum.</b>

17:30.650 --> 17:31.810
<b>So...</b>

17:31.810 --> 17:32.890
<b>It's really over?</b>

17:32.890 --> 17:35.240
<b>You've made incredible progress.</b>

17:35.730 --> 17:38.180
<b>But you lack experience.</b>

17:40.260 --> 17:45.250
<b>About ten more fights, and you 
should stand a better chance.</b>

17:46.060 --> 17:50.750
<b>If we're in Heavens Arena, at least.</b>

17:52.250 --> 17:53.510
<b>Therefore,</b>

17:53.900 --> 17:56.570
<b>I will not fight you here again.</b>

17:58.310 --> 17:59.510
<b>Next time,</b>

17:59.510 --> 18:02.510
<b>we'll fight in the real world, 
without any rules to restrain us.</b>

18:03.430 --> 18:05.520
<b>With our lives on the line.</b>

18:17.610 --> 18:19.030
<b><i>He's so far away...</i></b>

18:19.600 --> 18:22.950
<b><i>But he's not out of reach.</i></b>

18:24.920 --> 18:26.820
<b><i>I need more training in Nen...</i></b>

18:27.350 --> 18:30.040
<b><i>To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!</i></b>

18:40.310 --> 18:43.070
<b>With this victory, Hisoka has 
earned his tenth win</b>

18:43.070 --> 18:46.330
<b>and the right to challenge a Floor Master!</b>

18:46.330 --> 18:49.310
<b>Gon has fought bravely, and we wish 
him the best in his next match.</b>

18:49.920 --> 18:51.420
<b>So that's all for now.</b>

18:51.420 --> 18:55.320
<b>This is your commentator, Cocco, signing off!</b>

18:55.820 --> 18:58.720
<b>A referee is supposed to be completely impartial.</b>

18:58.720 --> 19:00.450
<b>But given today's matchup,</b>

19:00.450 --> 19:02.060
<b>I thought it prudent</b>

19:02.060 --> 19:04.040
<b>to end the fight as quickly as possible,</b>

19:04.040 --> 19:07.200
<b>even if it meant lowering my standards.</b>

19:07.980 --> 19:10.260
<b>So he's a technical ref.</b>

19:10.260 --> 19:11.570
<b>What does that mean?</b>

19:12.050 --> 19:15.370
<b>If a ref believes that a 
fight may get dangerous,</b>

19:15.370 --> 19:19.220
<b>he'll award points like crazy, to finish it quickly.</b>

19:20.740 --> 19:23.690
<b>You have to take that into 
consideration when placing a bet.</b>

19:23.690 --> 19:29.230
<b>Man, I was certain that Hisoka would win 10-0...</b>

19:33.370 --> 19:37.500
<b>I have nothing to say to you 
about the fight with Hisoka.</b>

19:38.990 --> 19:42.990
<b>You were the one fighting him, 
so I'm sure you understand best of all.</b>

19:44.080 --> 19:44.990
<b>Understand what?</b>

19:45.470 --> 19:48.000
<b>What he learned from that fight.</b>

19:48.310 --> 19:49.390
<b>Yes!</b>

19:49.390 --> 19:51.610
<b>Gon, what did you learn?</b>

19:51.610 --> 19:52.540
<b>A secret.</b>

19:54.610 --> 19:56.500
<b>Gon-kun, Killua-kun...</b>

19:56.870 --> 20:01.290
<b>You will need to master 
your own styles of <i>Nen</i>,</b>

20:01.290 --> 20:04.260
<b>as you continue down your chosen paths.</b>

20:04.600 --> 20:05.580
<b>Yes!</b>

20:05.580 --> 20:06.660
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:06.660 --> 20:09.750
<b>I'm glad I was able to meet you.</b>

20:09.750 --> 20:13.650
<b>You've set a worthy mark for me to surpass!</b>

20:14.060 --> 20:16.160
<b>You think you can pass us?</b>

20:16.160 --> 20:17.610
<b>One day, for sure!</b>

20:17.610 --> 20:18.720
<b>Won't happen.</b>

20:18.720 --> 20:20.680
<b>I can't wait to see you do it, Zushi.</b>

20:21.140 --> 20:21.850
<b>Osu!</b>

20:23.160 --> 20:24.590
<b>Well, let's go.</b>

20:24.590 --> 20:25.440
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:25.440 --> 20:28.160
<b>Thank you for everything, Wing-san!</b>

20:28.160 --> 20:29.810
<b>Yeah, same here.</b>

20:29.810 --> 20:30.910
<b>Thank you.</b>

20:31.470 --> 20:33.570
<b>Take care, you two.</b>

20:33.570 --> 20:35.990
<b>Zushi, until we meet again!</b>

20:35.990 --> 20:37.140
<b>Osu!</b>

20:46.090 --> 20:49.900
<b>Well, you finally accomplished 
your objective, right?</b>

20:49.900 --> 20:50.430
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

20:51.290 --> 20:54.270
<b>Then we don't have any more business here.</b>

20:54.270 --> 20:56.460
<b>Gon, what are you going to do?</b>

20:56.460 --> 20:58.100
<b>Go back to Whale Island.</b>

20:58.600 --> 20:59.690
<b>Whale Island?</b>

21:00.020 --> 21:01.020
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

21:01.020 --> 21:03.970
<b>I was able to return the favor to Hisoka,</b>

21:03.970 --> 21:08.450
<b>so I want to go back to the island, 
and show Mito-san my license.</b>

21:09.020 --> 21:12.200
<b>It's been over half a year since I left...</b>

21:16.460 --> 21:18.050
<b>I guess I'll come with you.</b>

21:18.050 --> 21:18.710
<b>Huh?</b>

21:19.380 --> 21:21.360
<b>I'd like to meet Mito-san.</b>

21:21.360 --> 21:22.340
<b>Really?</b>

21:22.340 --> 21:24.000
<b>Then let's go together.</b>

21:24.000 --> 21:26.340
<b>Yeah, I'll just tag along.</b>

21:31.940 --> 21:34.890
<b>Bye-bye, Heavens Arena.</b>

21:38.280 --> 21:40.730
<b>Gon was able to land a punch on Hisoka</b>

21:40.730 --> 21:43.680
<b>and return the tag, as he'd promised.</b>

21:43.680 --> 21:45.850
<b>Despite losing the fight,</b>

21:45.850 --> 21:49.780
<b>Gon was satisfied after meeting his goal.</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.610
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.610
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.610 --> 23:19.960
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:10.780
<b>Today, we introduce...</b>

23:10.780 --> 23:11.380
<b>Gon!</b>

23:10.970 --> 23:14.790
<b>Gon learned that he still 
has a ways to go,</b>

23:11.380 --> 23:11.910
<b>Me?</b>

23:11.910 --> 23:13.620
<b>Gon became my first friend,</b>

23:13.620 --> 23:15.240
<b>after we met during the Hunter Exam.</b>

23:14.790 --> 23:18.020
<b>but he also met his goal of 
repaying an old debt.</b>

23:15.240 --> 23:16.570
<b>He's fun to be around because</b>

23:16.570 --> 23:18.250
<b>his expressions are always changing,</b>

23:18.020 --> 23:19.960
<b>He's intent on getting stronger.</b>

23:18.250 --> 23:19.960
<b>and you can't ever tell what he's thinking.</b>

23:25.230 --> 23:27.170
<b>Next time: Ging x And x Gon!</b>

23:27.170 --> 23:29.310
<b>Hey, Killua, wanna come to my place?</b>

23:29.310 --> 23:33.050
<b>I-I-I can't do much, 
but thank you for letting me stay!</b>

23:33.050 --> 23:34.300
<b>You're stuttering.</b>
