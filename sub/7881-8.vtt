00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Ahh, Christmas...

00:07.041 --> 00:11.041
That time of year when children
are at their absolute worst.

00:11.083 --> 00:13.458
You see, kids have figured out
that they'll get

00:13.500 --> 00:16.333
whatever they want
whether they're bad or good.

00:16.375 --> 00:20.458
So they all
became spoiled turds.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.625
Hey, I want that.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.250
It's too expensive.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.166
But it's Christmas.

00:29.208 --> 00:31.166
I get whatever I want!

00:31.208 --> 00:33.208
If you're a good boy.

01:59.166 --> 02:02.125
You're just lucky I don't beat
you like my dad did to me.

02:02.166 --> 02:05.709
In fact, let's pay
a visit to my dad

02:05.750 --> 02:08.583
so you can see what happens to
naughty boys when they grow up.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.792
Dad, tell him
how much jail sucks.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.875
Tell him about the beatings,
the rapes,

02:14.917 --> 02:17.625
the overly washed
Egyptian cotton bath towels.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.375
Tell him
so he'll stop being bad.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.959
Steve, just be happy
you're bad now

02:22.000 --> 02:23.709
and not when I was boy.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.750
Back then, Krampus
would have come for you.

02:25.792 --> 02:26.750
Krampus?

02:26.792 --> 02:28.750
Yes, Krampus.

02:28.792 --> 02:31.291
The demon of Christmas.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.375
When I was a boy
in Southern Bavaria,

02:33.417 --> 02:35.959
in lower Berchtesgaden,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.709
Santa would ride with Krampus.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.709
Santa would give gifts
to the good kids

02:40.750 --> 02:43.458
and Krampus would punish
the naughty ones.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.000
Scare you
with his rusty chains.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.542
Slap your bottom
with his birch branches.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.417
And if you were really bad,

02:50.458 --> 02:52.709
he'd throw you
in his almost child-sized sack

02:52.750 --> 02:54.333
and shake you good!

02:54.375 --> 02:56.458
Oh, that's Krampus for you.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.792
Yeah, sounds like a load
of bull jizzle.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.333
I've never heard of Krampus.

03:00.375 --> 03:03.208
That's because your gramps
trapped the demon, he did.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.750
On Christmas Eve,

03:04.792 --> 03:07.250
I snuck out of bed
to get more of Mother's strudel

03:07.291 --> 03:10.083
even though she told me
I couldn't have any more.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.208
I didn't care.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.333
I wanted more.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.709
When I got there,

03:13.750 --> 03:16.166
I saw that Krampus
had beat me to it.

03:16.208 --> 03:19.208
He was neck-deep
in Mutter's strudel.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.875
So I trapped him
in that copper pot.

03:21.917 --> 03:24.000
Copper-potted him good.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.083
And that's why you
and all the other baddies

03:26.125 --> 03:29.333
never get a visit
from Krampus on Christmas Eve.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.417
That's nonsense.

03:30.458 --> 03:32.083
See for yourself.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.208
That copper pot is with my stuff
in your basement.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.250
Okay, okay, I'm bored.

03:36.291 --> 03:37.959
Let's go.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.375
Krampus is real.

03:39.417 --> 03:40.917
Real I say!

03:40.959 --> 03:42.458
The copper pot's
in your basement.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.333
It's right there

03:43.375 --> 03:45.667
with my old Rossignol skis!

03:45.709 --> 03:48.166
They're super-long
and super-fast!

03:49.208 --> 03:51.208
Check your basement, Stan!

03:54.291 --> 03:56.041
So, Hayley, have you decided

03:56.083 --> 03:57.333
what to get the family

03:57.375 --> 03:59.625

what you want.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.709
Wh-What's going on?

04:38.750 --> 04:41.667
I need a job so I can get
the family a Christmas gift.

04:41.709 --> 04:43.208
The bar gets busy
during the holidays.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.792
Maybe you could use
an extra hand.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.125
You're too late, sister.

04:46.166 --> 04:49.667
I already hired college kids
from the water polo team.

04:49.709 --> 04:53.834
I've got almost too
many hands for jobs.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.291
Here's the classifieds.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.792
Ooh, the airport's hiring.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.583
What's with
this Speedo, Jeremy?

05:01.625 --> 05:03.458
It's too baggy.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.250
Is it a tandem Speedo
for two men?

05:07.417 --> 05:08.959
Eh, even this is too loose.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.083
Mark, hop in here!

05:13.959 --> 05:15.625
Did they get this on sale?

05:15.667 --> 05:17.083
Was this the floor model?

05:17.125 --> 05:19.166
Well, if it wasn't, it is now!

05:19.208 --> 05:20.166
Smash!

05:20.208 --> 05:21.458
Steven!

05:21.500 --> 05:23.041

of Grayskull,

05:23.083 --> 05:25.125
what do you think
you're doing?

05:25.166 --> 05:27.166
I am hiding these
until Christmas.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.333
Boy driving me insane.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.291
Got me talking
like Bernie Mac.

05:43.959 --> 05:44.959
Krampus?

05:45.000 --> 05:45.959
Jack?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
No, Jack's my dad.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.333
Let... me... out.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.291
I can't. You're a demon.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.542
I-It would be...

05:53.583 --> 05:54.875
unwise.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.166
Release... me.

05:57.208 --> 05:58.291
Hey, bitch!

05:58.333 --> 06:00.250
Where's my Mickey
Mouse towel?!

06:00.291 --> 06:01.375
I'm sorry!

06:01.417 --> 06:03.000
I'll try harder!

06:03.041 --> 06:05.125
Okay. If I let you out,

06:05.166 --> 06:07.542
will you promise to scare my
son and make him a good boy?

06:07.583 --> 06:08.667
Yeah!

06:08.709 --> 06:10.709
That's, like, exactly
what I do, man.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.291
Ow!

06:21.041 --> 06:22.500
No!

06:22.542 --> 06:23.667
Bring me Jack

06:23.709 --> 06:25.875
if you ever want
to see your son again!

06:25.917 --> 06:27.291
Wait!

06:33.417 --> 06:35.625
You did what?!

06:35.667 --> 06:37.125
I released Krampus.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.250
I just wanted him to
scare Steve straight.

06:39.291 --> 06:42.375
Sexual orientation
is not a choice!

06:42.417 --> 06:44.083
What?

06:44.125 --> 06:45.667
Look, Krampus took Steve,

06:45.709 --> 06:47.208
and he says he'll only
give him back

06:47.250 --> 06:48.291
if you take his place.

06:48.333 --> 06:49.917
What do you say, Dad?

06:49.959 --> 06:52.166
If I use my CIA connections
to get you out of here,

06:52.208 --> 06:54.041
will you switch with Steve?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.583
I'm in.

07:02.625 --> 07:06.250
Krampus probably took him
to his castle in Bavaria.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.458
I know where it is.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.583
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.458
See you, sucker!

07:17.417 --> 07:18.875
Yep.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.875
Yeah.

07:20.917 --> 07:23.000
Uh-huh.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.834
Yep.

07:27.792 --> 07:28.834
Get off me!

07:28.875 --> 07:30.041
Let me go!

07:30.083 --> 07:31.375
What are you doing?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.583
Krampus is back.

07:32.625 --> 07:33.875
He's been gone for, like,

07:33.917 --> 07:35.917
50 years or something,
you guys.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.500
You can't do this!

07:37.542 --> 07:39.709
I'm an American child!

07:39.750 --> 07:40.959
I'm a treasure!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.041
Well, you in Bavaria now.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.959
You need to be punished.

finger on me, I will per...

09:56.458 --> 09:58.208
Santa's evil sidekick?

09:58.250 --> 09:59.333
Santa must know
where he is.

09:59.375 --> 10:02.208
Santa won't help me.
Santa hates me.

10:02.250 --> 10:05.041
I'm coming for you, Smiths!

10:05.083 --> 10:06.542
Hyah!

10:08.000 --> 10:10.041
Look, even if I wanted
to ask for Santa's help,

10:10.083 --> 10:12.083
how am I supposed to get
to the North Pole?

10:12.125 --> 10:13.667
Oh, boys!

10:18.583 --> 10:20.125
Hyah!

10:20.166 --> 10:22.166
Damn...

10:24.375 --> 10:26.875
Santa's village is
behind this wall.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.250
Give me a boost.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.291
Take my hand!

10:39.667 --> 10:42.250
Stan!

10:48.583 --> 10:50.375
Harder.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.458
Way harder.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.333
How dare you come
to my house.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.208
Krampus.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.583
What about him?

11:07.625 --> 11:09.291
He's been gone
over 50 years.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.709
No, Krampus is alive.

11:10.750 --> 11:13.083
And he has my son.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.834
Who cares about your son?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.000
I can't go back
to sharing Christmas

11:17.041 --> 11:19.166
with that
soul-singing goat.

11:19.208 --> 11:21.041
Always nibbling
on my list.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.291
Please,
I need your help.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.125
I need to find Steve.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.542
Okay.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.917
I'll help you
get your boy

11:27.959 --> 11:32.000
if you help me
kill Krampus.

11:33.583 --> 11:34.625
Deal.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.083
Come on, Roger.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.750
Just a little longer.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.667
I'm almost there.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.875
Aw. Tissue
for your tears?

11:46.208 --> 11:48.458
You don't have
to be scared.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.750
Here, refresh yourself
with a cool drink of water.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.458
See, everyone here is nice.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.125
You guys seem okay.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.542
But that Krampus
is a real jerk.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.166
Oh, that's not true!
That's not the way.

12:03.667 --> 12:06.375
Krampus cares about you
more than anyone.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.291
He cares enough to punish you
when you're bad.

12:09.333 --> 12:12.333
That's cause he's a monster
who enjoys terrorizing kids.

12:12.375 --> 12:14.500
No, no, no, no, no,
you got it all wrong.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.834
So, why do you want my
grand-poppy-pop so bad?

14:05.875 --> 14:07.333
He seems like a
total lost cause.

14:07.375 --> 14:11.208
Which is exactly why I need
to apologize to him.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.500
Apologize?

14:12.542 --> 14:14.959
It's my fault
he turned out bad.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.083
I should have been
beating his ass

14:17.125 --> 14:20.333
instead of munching down
on your great-grandma's strudel.

14:20.375 --> 14:22.083
I failed him.

Shh.

No, no, no, no, no, don't.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.166
Look, everyone
makes mistakes.

14:28.208 --> 14:31.166
The important thing
is you're back.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.458

14:34.542 --> 14:36.458

kill Krampus!

14:39.959 --> 14:41.125
Wow, full moon tonight.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.792
Actually,
once you get above the clouds,

14:42.834 --> 14:44.625
- it's always a full moon.
- Is that true?

14:44.667 --> 14:46.125
Is any of this?

14:50.166 --> 14:52.333
Once we kill Krampus,

14:52.375 --> 14:55.333
you'll be on my permanent

14:55.375 --> 14:57.417

18:24.166 --> 18:25.542
Krampus was good.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.250
He cared about kids.

18:27.291 --> 18:28.458
Santa just spoils them.

18:28.500 --> 18:32.208
And I make a hell of a lot
of money doing it.

18:32.250 --> 18:35.375
Most of my portfolio
is in toy stocks.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.667
That's why you give
toys to everyone,

18:39.709 --> 18:41.375
whether they're
naughty or nice.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.250
The naughty kids
buy the most toys.

18:43.291 --> 18:44.375
Wait. What?

18:44.417 --> 18:45.583
Kids don't buy toys.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.750
You give toys away.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.750
How does that
make money?

18:47.792 --> 18:50.000
Do not overthink this.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.583
Just know that I am in bed

Every man for himself!

19:19.417 --> 19:22.041
You came to help me.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.709
I finally realized
the importance of family.

19:24.750 --> 19:29.542
And I wanted to tell you
I'm proud of you, son.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.834
You're a good guy.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.333
Because of you.

19:32.375 --> 19:33.750
Because you were so hard on me.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.125
Maybe.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.166
Maybe for people
to turn out good,

19:37.208 --> 19:39.458
they need a beating
every now and then.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.500
That's why the world
needs Krampus.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.125
Yes.

19:43.166 --> 19:46.709
And that's why the world
sucks so hard now.

19:46.750 --> 19:50.583
Because I took Krampus away.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.917
My... bad.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.834
You're...
Krampus.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.333
So I am.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.375
I suppose this is how I'm
to repay my debt to the world

20:26.417 --> 20:29.000
for taking Krampus away
all these years.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.291
So, will you remain
Krampus forever?

20:31.333 --> 20:32.875
Like, all the time?

20:32.917 --> 20:34.291
Who knows?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.000
In the meantime,
it's Christmas Eve,

20:36.041 --> 20:39.333
and I've got a lot
of bottoms to blister.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.834
You better be good,
boys and girls,

20:44.875 --> 20:47.583
or I'll beat you until blood's
coming from your ears

20:47.625 --> 20:49.375
and your eyes and your mouth.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.166
Merry Christmas!
