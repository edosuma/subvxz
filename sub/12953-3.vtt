00:23.204 --> 00:25.236
Mrs. Demarco, it's a pleasure.

00:25.237 --> 00:27.701
I'm the bank manager.
We spoke on the phone.

00:27.702 --> 00:29.292
Yeah.

00:29.293 --> 00:30.707
My jet got bouncy out of Newark.

00:30.708 --> 00:33.604
Not to be a pain in the shaker,
but can we cut to the dessert?

00:33.650 --> 00:35.143
By all means, please.

00:35.144 --> 00:36.255
This is Leon.

00:36.256 --> 00:39.535
Hey, how you doing? Leon Frost.
CPA of V.I.P. That's a nice suit.

00:39.629 --> 00:41.692
- Thanks, Leon.
- So, can we do business?

00:41.693 --> 00:43.959
Yes, I'm sure this is the right bank.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.004
Please check it again.

00:45.005 --> 00:47.561
Roger Fonseca. Have you never heard
of the Fonseca vineyards?

00:47.651 --> 00:48.153
No.

00:48.154 --> 00:52.672
Please, check it again. F-O-N-S-E-C-A,
like it says on the passport.

00:52.764 --> 00:56.042
You guarantee my name can't be traced
to my account number?

00:56.134 --> 00:58.650
Not that I have anything
to hide or anything.

00:58.743 --> 01:01.926
The names of all the account holders
are stored exclusively

01:02.064 --> 01:04.004
in my personal safe right here.

01:04.004 --> 01:08.808
It's a Manheim. Protected biometrically.

01:09.459 --> 01:11.380
It's good enough for three ex-presidents,

01:11.381 --> 01:13.881
I guess it's good enough
for a plumber's wife.

01:16.171 --> 01:19.068
Now, the minimum deposit
that I mentioned.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.550
Leon.

01:21.551 --> 01:24.051
That would be my department.

01:25.913 --> 01:28.413
And...

01:28.744 --> 01:31.244
Excellent.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.990
All right, uh, your full name.

01:34.421 --> 01:37.601
Claudia Maria Vasquez Demarco.

01:37.787 --> 01:40.874
- That's a lovely name.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

01:41.153 --> 01:43.763
This is ridiculous.
I'm gonna start getting upset

01:43.857 --> 01:46.357
if you don't find my
account information now.

01:47.068 --> 01:49.006
Your manager will not be happy
to lose my business.

01:49.007 --> 01:49.804
Excuse me, please, miss.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.841
You can tell me where I can go
to cash this check.

01:51.842 --> 01:54.342
I'm doing business here, Brady.
Go bother someone else.

01:54.430 --> 01:56.254
Is it me you are talking to
like that, mon?

01:56.255 --> 01:57.860
Yes, mon, it is.

01:57.861 --> 01:59.847
And I'm not in a good mood,
so just walk away.

01:59.848 --> 02:02.746
Boy, you need more peace
in your life, brother.

02:02.838 --> 02:05.810
Maybe you need a hearing aid, and I'm
not your brother, so shove off.

02:06.136 --> 02:08.336
Break it off.

02:08.338 --> 02:09.416
Guard!

02:09.417 --> 02:11.917
This is your account number, and that's
your name -- in code, of course.

02:12.764 --> 02:15.264
Yes?

02:16.746 --> 02:19.246
Excuse me. I'll be right back
in one minute.

02:19.353 --> 02:21.148
No problem. We'll hold down the fort.

02:21.149 --> 02:23.713
Anybody tries to steal
anything from you --

02:23.880 --> 02:26.380
- Leon!
- Oh. Sorry.

02:32.915 --> 02:35.415
Scanning the database records.

02:39.348 --> 02:40.937
Break it up!

02:40.938 --> 02:41.877
Break it up!

02:41.878 --> 02:44.378
Break it up!

02:52.546 --> 02:54.204
What's the account number?

02:54.205 --> 02:56.815
1-4-2-0-5-4-3-0-2-0-2-0-2-

02:56.907 --> 03:00.137
0-2-0-2-2-2-0-6-9-6-3-5.

03:12.268 --> 03:13.634
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:13.635 --> 03:14.859
Pardon me for that.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.513
Sorry. I apologize.

03:16.514 --> 03:19.014
Got it.

03:30.139 --> 03:31.914
What were you doing?

03:31.915 --> 03:33.980
Just...

03:33.981 --> 03:36.481
breaking into your safe.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.988
You almost fooled me.

03:57.107 --> 03:59.607
Thanks for coming. Come on in.

04:03.425 --> 04:05.925
Right here, please.

04:08.735 --> 04:10.031
Hungry.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.352
What? I'm starving. You're taking three.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.868
- These are for my kids.
- Well, these are for Mitchell.

04:15.008 --> 04:16.375
Your son is 14 months old.

04:16.375 --> 04:19.891
Is that too young to have pizza?
Hey, thanks for inviting us.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.046
So, I think something's going on between

04:27.047 --> 04:28.463
my sister and the birthday boy.

04:28.464 --> 04:30.833
Yeah, I've been watching, and I can
tell you, that's not a great thing.

04:30.834 --> 04:31.349
Why not?

04:31.350 --> 04:33.385
Well, 'cause the same thing
happens every time.

04:33.386 --> 04:35.355
He gets way too eager,
the girl breaks his heart,

04:35.356 --> 04:36.724
and I have to clean it up.

04:36.725 --> 04:39.225
Don't be a cynic.

04:40.057 --> 04:42.302
- Pizza and vegetables?
- I know.

04:42.303 --> 04:43.795
We should go some time.

04:43.796 --> 04:45.878
No woman ever wants to go to
the magic castle.

04:45.879 --> 04:47.854
I like magic.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.355
And I like your smile, too.

04:52.355 --> 04:53.422
This one right here?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.122
- This smile?
- Yeah, that one.

04:55.123 --> 04:56.473
How red is my face right now?

04:56.474 --> 04:57.745
- Very red.
- Yeah.

04:57.746 --> 04:59.649
Hey, guys. How's it going?

04:59.650 --> 05:01.066
- Hey. Very well.
- Easy, Tiger.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.464
Oh, no, I'm on fire, my friend.
She loves magic.

05:03.465 --> 05:04.786
Do you think people are having fun?

05:04.787 --> 05:07.287
- Hey!
- Whoa!

05:07.486 --> 05:08.566
You're so old.

05:08.567 --> 05:10.698
Dude, you're so bald. What's up, man?

05:10.699 --> 05:11.447
I'm so glad you're here.

05:11.448 --> 05:13.948
These are friends of mine.
This is Sydney. And Nadia.

05:14.008 --> 05:15.423
- How you doing?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

05:15.424 --> 05:16.030
And, uh...

05:16.031 --> 05:17.191
- Michael?
- Right.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.654
- How you doing, man?
- Nice to meet you.

05:18.655 --> 05:21.071
I used to work with these guys until
they went private sector on me.

05:21.072 --> 05:22.295
What do you do now?

05:22.296 --> 05:25.384
I work in a bank --
in the loan department.

05:29.442 --> 05:31.895
Looks  like the party just got started.

05:31.896 --> 05:35.315
Hey, Mr. Bristow. Want some pizza
or a cocktail?

05:44.178 --> 05:46.678
Dad.

05:47.325 --> 05:49.825
It must have been lost in the mail.

05:50.190 --> 05:51.366
Your invitation?

05:51.367 --> 05:53.867
Unless it was an e-vite.

05:53.999 --> 05:56.499
I don't read e-vites.

05:58.268 --> 06:00.113
Your mission last week in the Bahamas
paid off.

06:00.114 --> 06:02.288
We know who has the Valta.

06:02.289 --> 06:04.515
That's what you came here to tell me?
There's a briefing in the morning.

06:04.516 --> 06:07.003
I know.

06:07.004 --> 06:10.042
I've learned that you invited your
sister to live here.

06:10.227 --> 06:11.739
I'm letting her stay here, yes.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.898
Are you aware that Sloane has
Langley's approval

06:13.899 --> 06:16.937
to make her a permanent member
of our team at A.P.O.?

06:17.076 --> 06:20.782
If you're wondering whether I've told
Nadia that you killed our mother,

06:21.108 --> 06:23.074
no, I haven't.

06:23.075 --> 06:25.575
But I plan to.

06:25.710 --> 06:28.416
- Out of spite?
- Out of respect.

06:28.508 --> 06:30.400
Sydney, consider the ramifications.

06:30.401 --> 06:31.913
She's my sister. I need to tell her
the truth.

06:31.914 --> 06:33.471
This isn't about what you need, Sydney.

06:33.472 --> 06:35.031
No, apparently it's about what you need.

06:35.032 --> 06:37.532
You don't know how Nadia may react
to that information.

06:37.591 --> 06:40.298
Which will be especially true if she
finds out from another source.

06:40.389 --> 06:41.757
I needn't remind you that your sister

06:41.758 --> 06:44.435
has sworn to kill the man responsible
for your mother's death.

06:46.226 --> 06:48.069
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:48.070 --> 06:50.728
Syd, where are the candles? These guys
want to do the cake.

06:50.867 --> 06:53.367
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

06:55.229 --> 06:58.458
Trust me, dad, I don't look forward to
telling Nadia what you did

06:58.550 --> 07:00.791
or why you did it.

07:00.792 --> 07:02.876
But she will learn the truth somehow,

07:02.877 --> 07:05.377
and I would rather it be from me.

07:41.031 --> 07:43.878
10 days ago, the Valta computer was
stolen in broad daylight

07:43.972 --> 07:46.472
as it was being transferred to
NSA headquarters.

07:47.180 --> 07:50.886
Now, the Valta represents
cutting-edge technology.

07:51.026 --> 07:55.066
It will revolutionize information
gathering from satellite networks.

07:55.204 --> 07:57.959
- If it falls in the wrong hands --
- It would be like monster bad.

07:58.050 --> 08:01.995
Simply put, we cannot let
the Valta be delivered.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.074
Delivered to whom?

08:03.075 --> 08:06.401
A new terrorist network out of
Germany -- the Badenliga.

08:06.491 --> 08:09.431
The theft was financed by transferring
3 million euros

08:09.529 --> 08:12.711
into an untraceable account in
the Bahamas.

08:12.803 --> 08:16.986
Your work has given us the name of that
account -- Martin Bishop.

08:17.171 --> 08:20.545
Intel  indicates that Bishop is still
waiting to receive final payment

08:20.730 --> 08:23.230
before he delivers the Valta.

08:23.234 --> 08:24.963
Then we need to get to Bishop
right away.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.095
What do we know about him?

08:26.096 --> 08:28.035
He's a British ex-pat living in Spain.

08:28.036 --> 08:32.028
He has a reputation as
a lady-killer -- literally.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.610
His wife disappeared three years ago.

08:33.611 --> 08:36.318
Rumor has it that he killed her
to spend more time with his mistress.

08:36.438 --> 08:37.327
Charming.

08:37.328 --> 08:40.511
Professionally, Bishop specializes
in acquiring high-risk,

08:40.650 --> 08:43.150
high-reward military targets.

08:43.207 --> 08:47.629
The Valta must be recovered
or destroyed.

08:48.048 --> 08:50.610
I want you to find it.

08:50.795 --> 08:53.295
That'll be all.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.859
Sydney.

09:00.762 --> 09:03.124
Thank you.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.615
For what?

09:04.616 --> 09:07.880
For letting my daughter stay with you.

09:08.811 --> 09:11.469
As Nadia acclimates to this life,

09:12.867 --> 09:14.417
to her new family,

09:14.418 --> 09:16.813
she needs support,

09:16.814 --> 09:19.379
and you have put my mind at ease.

09:19.470 --> 09:20.790
The thought that I did something

09:20.791 --> 09:22.778
that might have given you a warm
and fuzzy feeling

09:22.779 --> 09:25.913
makes me want to kick my own sister
out of my house.

09:26.798 --> 09:27.922
Yeah.

09:27.923 --> 09:30.913
Well, Nadia won't be assisting you on
the Bishop case.

09:31.052 --> 09:33.085
Now that she's joining our team,

09:33.086 --> 09:36.268
your father has offered to run her
through her psych evaluation.

09:39.486 --> 09:40.517
Really?

09:40.518 --> 09:42.601
The Yakahoshi review can predict how
an individual

09:42.602 --> 09:46.641
will react to highly stressful situations
and the discovery of delicate intel.

09:47.668 --> 09:48.988
Delicate intel?

09:48.989 --> 09:50.119
Sydney, I'm resigned to the fact

09:50.120 --> 09:51.964
that you're going to tell Nadia
what happened,

09:51.965 --> 09:53.429
but when are you going to do that?

09:53.430 --> 09:55.466
Now? Two hours before you leave for
an operation?

09:55.467 --> 09:57.348
Not until I get back.

09:57.349 --> 09:58.900
Understood.

09:58.901 --> 10:01.401
And I agree. It's for the best.

10:02.563 --> 10:05.063
What are you up to, dad?

10:07.155 --> 10:09.655
They're waiting for you, Sydney.

10:22.342 --> 10:24.842
Nadia.

10:26.174 --> 10:28.674
Is he always so cold?

10:28.993 --> 10:31.493
Jack?

10:31.515 --> 10:33.910
I'm afraid so.

10:33.911 --> 10:35.745
So, I was wondering,

10:35.746 --> 10:37.399
are you free tonight?

10:37.400 --> 10:40.581
There's this restaurant on Melrose.
It serves Argentinean food.

10:41.281 --> 10:43.549
We can go any place you'd like.

10:43.550 --> 10:45.979
I'd like that.

10:45.980 --> 10:48.480
Good.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.880
I'll see you when you're through.

10:51.881 --> 10:54.381
Okay.

10:56.827 --> 10:58.623
Great. I'll check that out with the NSA.

10:58.624 --> 11:01.882
Intel indicates Bishop owns a dozen
industrial properties in Spain.

11:01.974 --> 11:04.439
Any one of them could be a safe hiding
place for the Valta.

11:04.440 --> 11:08.908
Bishop also recently purchased
an MK-1200 from Cheline Tech.

11:09.682 --> 11:13.387
Well, you don't buy a server like that
to look at online porn.

11:13.481 --> 11:16.472
No, you buy it to coordinate
international business operations.

11:16.565 --> 11:17.647
At least that's what it's made for.

11:17.648 --> 11:18.682
Logistics, essentially.

11:18.683 --> 11:20.909
So let's assume the location of
the Valta is on that server.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.418
And the server's on his estate.

11:22.419 --> 11:25.362
An hour out of Malaga.
A couple hundreds acres.

11:25.455 --> 11:28.924
And you can't hack into an MK-1200
from the outside, FYI.

11:28.969 --> 11:30.670
Okay, so what if you're on the inside?

11:30.671 --> 11:32.131
Multiple electric fences,

11:32.132 --> 11:34.886
cameras on high sweep, armed guards,
comm jammers.

11:34.979 --> 11:36.966
Well, if you can get past all that,

11:36.967 --> 11:38.763
I've got this really cool laser
lock pick

11:38.764 --> 11:40.321
that will help you hack into the server.

11:40.322 --> 11:44.220
It's housed in this watch that's awesomely
designed by me, Marshall J. Flinkman.

11:44.358 --> 11:46.536
Except I'm still working on that
overheating problem --

11:46.537 --> 11:47.857
So we need to get into that house,

11:47.858 --> 11:50.659
get into the server, and that will tell
us where he's hiding the Valta.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.361
How do you break into the house of
a master thief?

11:53.455 --> 11:55.242
I don't think you do.

11:55.243 --> 11:57.743
I think you have to be invited.

12:35.659 --> 12:36.880
Ok, they're approaching.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.582
I've locked onto the cell phone
frequencies.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.083
All set.

12:41.234 --> 12:43.734
Pull over.

12:59.119 --> 13:00.343
Marshall, can you flip that?

13:00.344 --> 13:02.546
Oh sorry.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.224
Okay. Cell phones are jammed.

13:04.225 --> 13:06.114
- Hey, it's not igniting.
- What?

13:06.115 --> 13:07.576
All right, hold on a sec.

13:07.577 --> 13:10.077
Sometimes you just need a little
magic touch.

13:10.593 --> 13:12.232
And...

13:12.233 --> 13:14.733
Fire!

13:14.994 --> 13:17.315
Help! Help!

13:17.316 --> 13:19.578
I can't get my seatbelt off!

13:19.579 --> 13:20.261
Are you all right?

13:20.262 --> 13:22.438
No, my seat belt's stuck.

13:22.439 --> 13:23.712
Please, sir, please hurry.

13:23.713 --> 13:25.158
- Can you move?
- Please, my seatbelt right here!

13:25.159 --> 13:25.937
Please!

13:25.938 --> 13:26.669
Call for help!

13:26.670 --> 13:29.170
I  can't get my seatbelt off!
Please, sir, please!

13:29.201 --> 13:31.023
It's stuck!

13:31.024 --> 13:33.539
- Please, please, please...
- It's stuck.

13:35.592 --> 13:36.721
Trigger the belt.

13:36.722 --> 13:38.185
What, you don't want to milk this
a little bit?

13:38.186 --> 13:39.360
Marshall, do it.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.861
Sorry. You don't have to get so snappy.

13:56.938 --> 13:58.593
And now for the big finish --

13:58.594 --> 14:01.094
Rock 'n roll Cleveland!

14:02.513 --> 14:05.013
Ahh!

14:06.512 --> 14:09.012
- Sir, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.664
- What about you?
- Yeah.

14:12.082 --> 14:14.117
Sir, I can't get a signal.
I don't know what's wrong.

14:14.118 --> 14:15.464
Please don't call anybody.

14:15.465 --> 14:17.965
Please.

14:19.723 --> 14:21.837
You just rolled your car.

14:21.838 --> 14:24.496
You must have been going at 200
kilometers an hour.

14:24.635 --> 14:26.337
Sometimes you need to drive fast.

14:26.338 --> 14:28.838
So why are you in such a rush?

14:30.146 --> 14:32.646
Long story.

14:34.260 --> 14:35.604
This guy scares me.

14:35.605 --> 14:37.069
I mean, he killed his wife.

14:37.070 --> 14:38.675
He's a wife-killer.

14:38.676 --> 14:41.238
Beat her to death, stuffed her in
a dumpster, who knows what else?

14:41.331 --> 14:43.679
Marshall, shut up.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.180
Where you headed?

14:50.275 --> 14:52.775
You just saved my life.

14:54.578 --> 14:56.731
Perhaps I did.

14:56.732 --> 14:59.232
I'm quite something, aren't I?

14:59.373 --> 15:01.873
To me you are.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.409
You know, a doctor should really
look at --

15:03.410 --> 15:06.544
No. I'm fine.

15:08.177 --> 15:10.677
Look, I just need a place to rest.

15:11.279 --> 15:15.128
I haven't slept much the past few days,
that's all. I'm fine.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.194
I live near here.

15:22.078 --> 15:24.578
I'm taking you back to my house.

15:28.696 --> 15:31.196
Okay.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.043
Outrigger to Base.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.313
Phoenix  is in.

15:46.314 --> 15:48.814
She's on her own.

15:51.478 --> 15:53.037
Shotgun to Base. We're on position.

15:53.038 --> 15:54.588
We're still on schedule.

15:54.589 --> 15:56.082
Outrigger's patching us into the grid.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.357
We'll have laser mike operational
in five minutes.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.724
Affirmative, Shotgun.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.428
We're standing by for your information

16:01.429 --> 16:02.460
Roger that.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.925
Are you sure we can't use
standard comms?

16:03.926 --> 16:06.869
No, Bishop is using at least four
high-impedance jammers.

16:06.962 --> 16:09.190
Okay, to burrow a hole through
that kind of noise,

16:09.191 --> 16:12.419
Sydney would have to wear a generator
the size of a baby hippopotamus.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.977
You know, and that's certainly no way
to sneak around somebody's house,

16:14.978 --> 16:18.495
with a baby hippopotamus strapped to
your... back.

16:18.587 --> 16:21.087
Good luck.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.598
It's a nice shower.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.982
Yeah?

17:21.983 --> 17:24.130
Good.

17:24.131 --> 17:26.522
I'm glad you liked it.

17:26.523 --> 17:29.024
How are you feeling?

17:29.615 --> 17:31.581
Fine.

17:31.582 --> 17:33.737
Grateful.

17:33.738 --> 17:36.238
No more thanks.

17:36.501 --> 17:39.304
You're a good excuse to get to know
my house.

17:39.908 --> 17:43.233
I haven't been in this room
in three years.

17:43.513 --> 17:45.765
Three years?

17:45.766 --> 17:48.266
Not since my wife left me.

17:50.838 --> 17:53.338
I'm sorry to hear about it.

17:53.471 --> 17:55.580
It's in the past.

17:55.581 --> 17:58.081
Yeah?

18:09.997 --> 18:11.590
Your shoulder.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.091
It's nothing.

18:21.347 --> 18:23.847
All of this didn't come from
the accident.

18:25.284 --> 18:27.020
It's fine.

18:27.021 --> 18:29.521
Who are you running from?

18:30.723 --> 18:31.898
Your wife left you.

18:31.899 --> 18:33.779
I left someone.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.142
Only he didn't want me to go.

18:36.143 --> 18:37.653
Who is he?

18:37.654 --> 18:39.593
I can have someone talk to him.

18:39.594 --> 18:42.094
I'm all right.

18:43.486 --> 18:45.986
Now I'm all right.

18:46.910 --> 18:49.410
I'll just have to remember not
to wear something strapless.

18:53.062 --> 18:55.562
I have some business in town.

18:56.452 --> 18:58.800
Stay here, Charlene,

18:58.801 --> 19:00.628
and rest.

19:00.629 --> 19:03.129
When I get back, we'll have dinner.

19:03.695 --> 19:05.681
My car's totaled.

19:05.682 --> 19:08.182
I'm not going anywhere.

19:10.610 --> 19:13.110
Thank you, Martin.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.574
Oh stay inside.

19:21.575 --> 19:22.754
Don't wander the grounds.

19:22.755 --> 19:25.255
There's... security.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.140
I'll stay put.

19:29.684 --> 19:32.184
You might need to wake me
when you get back.

19:33.782 --> 19:36.282
I look forward to it.

19:45.935 --> 19:49.260
You've been sent to Paris to extract
a deep-cover operative.

19:49.306 --> 19:52.489
You've successfully transferred him to
a safe house on Ile St. Louis

19:52.582 --> 19:56.001
when a secure communication comes in
that you've been exposed.

19:57.260 --> 19:59.760
Do you abort?

20:00.348 --> 20:01.620
Well, that depends if he's --

20:01.621 --> 20:04.185
What's your impulse?
That's what this is about.

20:04.510 --> 20:07.692
- Is the operative one of us?
- Yes or no?

20:10.164 --> 20:12.664
No.

20:14.138 --> 20:16.702
While tapping a phone line of a target
in New Delhi,

20:16.793 --> 20:19.209
you're spotted by the enemy.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.915
Your partner tells you to continue with
the mission objective

20:22.008 --> 20:24.665
while he neutralizes the target.

20:25.270 --> 20:27.689
Do you obey him or fight back?

20:27.690 --> 20:29.962
Is the phone system the new PBX matrix?

20:29.963 --> 20:32.574
Just answer the question, please.

20:33.412 --> 20:35.912
Why is my partner a man?

20:38.719 --> 20:42.043
The sex of your partner is irrelevant.

20:42.136 --> 20:43.817
Oh.

20:43.818 --> 20:46.318
No, I would not obey.

20:47.761 --> 20:49.915
I'd help her fight him off.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.624
Then she and I could finish
the job together.

20:57.101 --> 20:59.601
Jack?

20:59.768 --> 21:02.268
How's she doing?

21:02.349 --> 21:04.334
I don't quite know yet.

21:04.335 --> 21:07.517
Oh, come on, Jack. It's been two hours.
You must have formed an opinion.

21:07.609 --> 21:10.601
I have, but I need to be certain.

21:11.859 --> 21:14.359
Of course.

21:32.356 --> 21:34.566
Shotgun to Phoenix.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.262
How do you read?

21:36.263 --> 21:38.763
This is so weird.

21:39.082 --> 21:41.582
It sounds like you're right next to me.

21:42.870 --> 21:45.370
- You can hear me?
- No.

21:46.314 --> 21:48.828
Good. It's like talking
to my conscience.

21:49.203 --> 21:51.703
It is a little bit, isn't it?

21:52.254 --> 21:54.047
Merlin, what's your status?

21:54.048 --> 21:56.548
Give me a sec.

21:58.907 --> 22:00.669
Okay, uh...

22:00.670 --> 22:01.562
Okay, let me see.

22:01.563 --> 22:03.504
Okay, we've got a huge power drain
in the basement.

22:03.505 --> 22:05.044
It's the room at the far southern end.

22:05.045 --> 22:07.301
Copy that.

22:07.302 --> 22:10.383
Phoenix, your target is in the basement.

22:10.476 --> 22:11.654
Southernmost room.

22:11.655 --> 22:13.119
It looks like an office.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.565
Rendezvous at the far window
on the first floor.

22:15.566 --> 22:17.313
Move on my mark.

22:17.314 --> 22:19.350
I see two visible bogeys,

22:19.351 --> 22:21.841
one on the third floor,

22:21.842 --> 22:23.619
one below.

22:23.620 --> 22:26.120
Okay, you're clear. Go.

23:05.382 --> 23:07.701
I was upside down, and the seatbelt
wouldn't come undone.

23:07.702 --> 23:09.498
And the car was blazing.

23:09.499 --> 23:12.156
Joss -- Joss, calm down. I'll tell you.

23:13.182 --> 23:14.976
He pulled me out.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.392
And we just got free,
and the thing blew up.

23:17.393 --> 23:19.893
Huge.

23:29.253 --> 23:32.388
- We're good.
- Good. Move fast.

24:03.603 --> 24:06.103
Come on, come on, come on.

24:19.212 --> 24:21.053
I found the Valta.

24:21.054 --> 24:22.567
It's located at Alameda yards.

24:22.568 --> 24:24.460
I.D. Number is Charlie-0717.

24:24.461 --> 24:25.924
Okay, the coast is clear.

24:25.925 --> 24:28.425
Get out of there. I'll see you
at the extraction point.

24:39.786 --> 24:41.870
- Sydney's on her way.
- On our way for pickup.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.564
This is Arvin Sloane.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.410
Requested intel has been acquired.

24:45.411 --> 24:51.977
Valta is located in container
I.D. Charlie-0717 in Alameda yards.

24:58.603 --> 24:59.733
Wait. Stand down.

24:59.734 --> 25:02.234
- What?
- What is it?

25:11.208 --> 25:13.421
I saw you pull in.

25:13.422 --> 25:15.922
You seem out of breath.

25:18.387 --> 25:20.887
I'm just glad you're back.

25:21.155 --> 25:23.655
Really?

25:23.818 --> 25:26.318
This way.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.737
We've got a problem.

25:32.056 --> 25:34.556
You're one of a three-man team --

25:34.742 --> 25:37.878
three-woman team, if you prefer.

25:38.484 --> 25:40.786
A tactical mission.

25:40.787 --> 25:43.826
You suspect that one of your team
members may be a mole.

25:44.665 --> 25:46.545
Do you tell the third?

25:46.546 --> 25:49.046
Hmm. No.

25:51.993 --> 25:54.313
You return from an operation overseas.

25:54.314 --> 25:55.965
While the mission was successful,

25:55.966 --> 25:58.466
certain information may
reflect negatively

25:58.554 --> 26:00.855
on one of your team members.

26:00.856 --> 26:03.703
Do you include said information
in your op report?

26:03.797 --> 26:06.277
No.

26:06.278 --> 26:08.778
Mr. Bristow?

26:09.462 --> 26:10.957
Yes?

26:10.958 --> 26:12.565
I don't mean to seem impatient,

26:12.566 --> 26:17.798
but I've never done anything
that's lasted as long as this.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.577
How sad for you.

26:22.590 --> 26:25.090
Jack Bristow.

26:26.799 --> 26:29.299
We're through.

26:30.164 --> 26:32.103
I gave Langley the location
of the Valta.

26:32.104 --> 26:32.901
Are they acting on it?

26:32.902 --> 26:34.365
They have a team standing by in Malaga.

26:34.366 --> 26:36.260
They're about to raid one of Bishop's
truck yards.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.009
What about Sydney?

26:37.010 --> 26:38.712
She's still in the house with Bishop.

26:38.713 --> 26:40.777
Is her cover blown?

26:40.778 --> 26:42.241
I don't know.

26:42.242 --> 26:43.133
Can we extract her?

26:43.134 --> 26:45.437
Not yet. Langley considers the raid
top priority.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.188
We have the authority to seize Bishop

26:47.189 --> 26:49.606
only after the Valta is secured
or destroyed.

26:49.607 --> 26:52.266
I'm sorry, Jack, but I just thought
that you should know.

26:52.357 --> 26:55.492
Then I'm going to Spain myself, and
I'd like to take Nadia with me.

26:55.958 --> 27:00.236
Uh, about that -- have you learned
anything helpful?

27:00.330 --> 27:01.840
Enough.

27:01.841 --> 27:04.341
Enough to deal with the problem at hand.

27:15.494 --> 27:17.050
It occurred to me

27:17.051 --> 27:19.100
that this night

27:19.101 --> 27:23.141
represents things I've been considering
for some time.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.620
How's that?

27:27.076 --> 27:29.521
The choices I make.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.323
People with whom I choose
to keep company.

27:33.630 --> 27:36.130
Work versus...

27:36.226 --> 27:37.578
everything else.

27:37.579 --> 27:40.189
If you can hear me, tuck your hair
behind your ear.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.156
Sounds like a mid-existential crisis.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.477
Yes. That's it.

27:48.478 --> 27:50.466
Okay, Langley's ordered a raid on
the Alameda yard.

27:50.467 --> 27:52.967
You have got to get out of there.

27:54.271 --> 27:56.571
It's easy to doubt yourself,

27:56.572 --> 27:59.280
but sometimes you need to stick with it
and stay the course.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.169
Damn it, no.
You've got to get out of there.

28:01.170 --> 28:03.670
When Bishop hears about the raid,
he'll suspect you.

28:03.731 --> 28:07.009
But I think in my case,
it might be time to make a

28:07.195 --> 28:09.130
mid-course correction.

28:09.131 --> 28:11.364
The fact is,

28:11.365 --> 28:13.881
I don't believe in coincidence.

28:13.973 --> 28:16.473
Meaning what?

28:16.937 --> 28:20.024
You and I were destined to meet?

28:20.163 --> 28:22.663
Possibly.

28:22.671 --> 28:25.882
But I'm more interested to know
why we met.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.441
I told you,

28:33.139 --> 28:35.653
I was involved with the wrong man.

28:36.354 --> 28:38.854
I don't believe that.

28:44.627 --> 28:46.935
Let's move! Move, move!

28:46.936 --> 28:47.733
Go.

28:47.734 --> 28:50.234
Call one in position.

28:53.019 --> 28:55.519
Fan out.

29:11.005 --> 29:12.491
Everyone get back, right now!

29:12.492 --> 29:14.992
Fall back!

29:15.598 --> 29:18.098
Cover me!

29:19.529 --> 29:22.378
I don't get it. Why doesn't she just
kick his ass, you know, and then run?

29:22.518 --> 29:24.266
She doesn't want to blow her cover.

29:24.267 --> 29:27.260
Wants to get out clean in case
the raid goes South.

29:27.352 --> 29:29.852
Shotgun, team's down.

29:29.994 --> 29:32.494
Weiss was team leader.

29:32.553 --> 29:35.053
We believe he's been captured.

29:35.172 --> 29:36.396
Take that son of a bitch out.

29:36.397 --> 29:39.008
The CIA team's under attack.
They've got Weiss.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.500
You're trembling.

29:48.043 --> 29:52.082
I want to be honest, but everything
has happened so fast.

29:52.642 --> 29:56.588
I promised myself I wouldn't
see someone again.

29:58.126 --> 30:01.310
- I really need more details.
- About me?

30:01.401 --> 30:02.721
We don't have more details.

30:02.722 --> 30:04.424
Weiss took out the Valta
with the grenade,

30:04.425 --> 30:06.941
and then he went radio-silent.
You've got to move now.

30:07.035 --> 30:09.535
I have nothing to hide.

30:11.871 --> 30:14.371
Excuse me.

30:16.580 --> 30:17.851
Yeah?

30:17.852 --> 30:20.397
Sir, we've just had an incident
at Alameda yard.

30:21.656 --> 30:23.309
How bad?

30:23.310 --> 30:26.063
The Valta was destroyed. It was CIA.

30:26.622 --> 30:28.561
I double-checked our signal's traffic.

30:28.562 --> 30:32.222
Somebody was on your server,
in your house, an hour ago.

30:32.362 --> 30:34.621
Interesting.

30:34.622 --> 30:37.122
Thank you, Pierre.

30:42.734 --> 30:45.234
You all right?

30:47.140 --> 30:50.800
Your expression -- reminds me
of my uncle.

30:50.985 --> 30:52.000
Shotgun to Outrigger,

30:52.001 --> 30:54.419
Phoenix just gave the call sign.
I'm going in. Request backup.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.216
I'm on my way. Blow the alarm system.

30:56.217 --> 30:58.717
Got it.

31:14.981 --> 31:17.481
Outrigger, anything?

31:17.984 --> 31:19.399
Negative.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.900
Where is she?

31:22.164 --> 31:24.664
Where is anyone?

31:27.367 --> 31:29.546
The escape tunnel only gave them
a 10-minute lead.

31:29.547 --> 31:30.449
I know. I know. Okay, I know.

31:30.450 --> 31:31.390
They've got to be somewhere.

31:31.391 --> 31:31.858
So find them.

31:31.859 --> 31:33.325
You're getting very impatient.
I'm doing the best I can.

31:33.326 --> 31:33.979
You've been doing it for an hour.

31:33.980 --> 31:36.206
Well, to trace a guy on a cellular
network using the frequency of his phone

31:36.207 --> 31:38.241
is like trying to find a needle
in a county full of haystacks.

31:38.242 --> 31:38.943
You have to find --

31:38.944 --> 31:41.746
Yeah, I know what I'm supposed to be
doing, all right? Just shut up!

31:44.405 --> 31:47.635
- Sorry about that.
- No. That was good.

31:49.361 --> 31:50.636
Hey, we got a hit.

31:50.637 --> 31:51.105
Found them?

31:51.106 --> 31:52.378
Well, the cell phone signal's weak.

31:52.379 --> 31:54.879
- Can you locate them?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.249
Okay.

32:00.024 --> 32:01.672
They were tracking Bishop.

32:01.673 --> 32:04.173
We'll coordinate with Vaughn
on the ground.

32:06.329 --> 32:08.829
I know it must be hard for you...

32:09.621 --> 32:12.121
having me at A.P.O.

32:12.407 --> 32:14.288
Not at all.

32:14.289 --> 32:16.789
I can't defend the choices
my mother made.

32:16.892 --> 32:20.600
Nadia, I would never blame you
for your mother's infidelity.

32:23.258 --> 32:26.345
But there is something
I need to share with you.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.547
I only do this because of your
test results.

32:32.965 --> 32:35.529
- Did I fail horribly?
- Hardly.

32:36.135 --> 32:39.889
Not surprisingly, your ability to adapt
to sudden changes in protocol,

32:40.028 --> 32:43.736
to handle adverse situations,
is exceptional.

32:44.248 --> 32:47.240
The results were very much
like your sister's.

32:49.181 --> 32:50.786
Sydney doesn't know this yet.

32:50.787 --> 32:53.287
The result of an ongoing investigation.

32:56.052 --> 33:00.617
Ironically, this intel came in to me
just this morning.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.832
- This is Sloane.
- It's Vaughn.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.105
We've got Jack and Nadia.

33:18.106 --> 33:20.606
We're tracking Bishop,
and we're en route.

33:32.550 --> 33:35.351
Let me explain something to you.

33:36.471 --> 33:39.177
I have been paid -- handsomely paid --

33:39.504 --> 33:42.114
by the Badenliga to deliver the
Valta computer,

33:42.253 --> 33:45.132
which you decided to destroy with
the toss of a hand grenade.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.210
You're welcome.

33:46.211 --> 33:48.711
As you can imagine,
they won't be very happy.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.978
And when they get here,

33:50.979 --> 33:52.673
which they will shortly,

33:52.674 --> 33:54.041
they'll kill me.

33:54.042 --> 33:58.226
Unless I can provide them with
information of an equal or greater value.

33:58.531 --> 34:01.031
You're both CIA,

34:01.073 --> 34:04.161
so you've obviously infiltrated
my friends' network.

34:04.766 --> 34:07.266
I want to know how.

34:09.601 --> 34:10.976
So...

34:10.978 --> 34:13.478
what's your real name, Charlene?

34:18.987 --> 34:21.487
I'm, uh...

34:22.541 --> 34:25.041
"I'm, uh..." what?

34:25.828 --> 34:27.719
I'm a-gonna kick your ass.

34:27.721 --> 34:30.221
You son of a bitch!

34:38.516 --> 34:41.016
The next one goes between your eyes.

34:41.261 --> 34:43.761
Now --

34:46.875 --> 34:49.375
Yeah?

34:49.780 --> 34:52.280
The Badenliga.

35:03.247 --> 35:06.954
If they move, shoot them
in the kneecaps.

35:28.235 --> 35:30.735
God, my heart!

35:45.620 --> 35:47.750
What the hell is going on? You said
you weren't agency anymore.

35:47.751 --> 35:49.452
I'll tell you later. Thanks for
the distraction.

35:49.453 --> 35:51.953
Yeah, thanks for saving my life.

35:52.281 --> 35:54.029
Wait a minute, this is black ops,
isn't it?

35:54.030 --> 35:55.494
Huh? Vaughn part of this, too?

35:55.495 --> 35:56.246
We got to go.

35:56.247 --> 35:58.747
- Am I right?
- We got to go.

36:27.035 --> 36:29.535
Go for Bishop.

36:57.971 --> 37:00.471
Dude, I knew it!

37:45.410 --> 37:47.482
I liked you...

37:47.483 --> 37:49.368
much better...

37:49.369 --> 37:51.869
as Charlene.

38:16.474 --> 38:19.993
Is that how you normally deal
with bad guys?

38:21.486 --> 38:23.986
He was the one.

38:24.347 --> 38:26.847
Bishop.

38:29.723 --> 38:32.223
He killed our mother.

38:50.132 --> 38:53.316
Dad, why does Nadia think that
Bishop killed our mother?

38:53.408 --> 38:55.908
I adjusted some details in
Bishop's file.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.688
You set her up.

38:58.689 --> 39:01.586
I'd hardly call Martin Bishop an ally.

39:02.472 --> 39:05.083
I solved two problems with one answer.

39:05.175 --> 39:06.921
You manipulated Nadia.

39:06.922 --> 39:09.422
I gave your sister closure.

39:09.701 --> 39:11.441
But not the truth.

39:11.442 --> 39:14.053
Sometimes a satisfying lie, Sydney,

39:14.146 --> 39:16.957
can do more good than the awful truth.
