00:00.166 --> 00:01.834
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:01.917 --> 00:04.417
I am just trying to move on
with my life.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.291
Are you having an affair
with my husband?

00:06.458 --> 00:08.417
<i>Suspicion ended in tragedy.</i>

00:08.500 --> 00:11.041
I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
He had a heart attack.

00:11.125 --> 00:13.375
<i>- Trust...</i>
- It kills me to put you through this.

00:13.458 --> 00:14.875
<i>...was put on trial.</i>

00:14.959 --> 00:17.250
Bring me the passport
and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.333
<i>- An ex-husband...</i>
- You walked out on your family.

00:20.458 --> 00:21.542
<i>...was replaced.</i>

00:21.625 --> 00:24.959
She is out there
throwing herself at Mike Delfino.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.542
<i>And everyone...</i>

00:26.625 --> 00:28.792
Your own personal nanny? Smell you.

00:28.875 --> 00:33.000
<i>...was getting in over their heads.</i>

00:37.000 --> 00:42.208
<i>Edie Britt could never understand</i>
<i>why she didn't have any female friends.</i>

00:43.375 --> 00:48.166
<i>Of course, she always tried</i>
<i>to tell people she didn't need any.</i>

00:48.250 --> 00:53.750
<i>But the truth was it bothered Edie that</i>
<i>other women didn't seem to like her.</i>

00:55.000 --> 00:57.250
<i>Even after moving to Wisteria Lane...</i>

00:57.333 --> 00:59.166
There are breakables in there.

00:59.291 --> 01:03.375
<i>...Edie couldn't understand why</i>
<i>her neighbors kept their distance.</i>

01:06.583 --> 01:09.458
<i>And then she met Martha Huber.</i>

01:09.542 --> 01:10.583
<i>Hola!</i>

01:10.667 --> 01:15.083
<i>Within five minutes Mrs. Huber managed</i>
<i>to disparage what Edie was wearing.</i>

01:15.166 --> 01:16.208
No.

01:16.291 --> 01:21.542
<i>In fact, whenever they got together,</i>
<i>Mrs. Huber insulted her.</i>

01:21.625 --> 01:26.166
<i>She made fun of everything</i>
<i>from Edie's make-up...</i>

01:26.250 --> 01:28.458
<i>...to her taste in men.</i>

01:28.542 --> 01:34.750
<i>Yes, Martha Huber could be cruel,</i>
<i>offensive and downright mean.</i>

01:34.834 --> 01:39.125
<i>But Edie didn't care,</i>
<i>because she was the first real friend</i>

01:39.208 --> 01:42.291
<i>Edie Britt had ever had.</i>

01:43.125 --> 01:47.917
<i>But now Martha Huber was missing.</i>
<i>She had vanished without a trace.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:52.500
<i>And Edie was not embarrassed</i>
<i>to admit she needed her back.</i>

01:53.500 --> 01:56.041
- Edie?
- Yes.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.417
I'm Felicia Tillman.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.041
- Martha's sister.
- Really?

02:01.125 --> 02:04.041
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

02:04.125 --> 02:07.250
It's just Martha always said
how alike you two were.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.583
I don't see the family resemblance.

02:09.667 --> 02:12.875
It's there. It just takes a while
to become apparent.

02:15.917 --> 02:18.333
- Do you have the key to her house?
- I do.

02:18.417 --> 02:22.667
After the police kicked the door in,
they put on this temporary lock.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.750
Oh, and the neighbors
are coming over at noon.

02:25.917 --> 02:28.542
We're going to organize
and hand out flyers.

02:29.792 --> 02:33.083
- The key?
- Right.

02:33.166 --> 02:36.041
I can only imagine
how worried you must be.

02:36.125 --> 02:39.917
I'm not worried, Edie. Martha and I
have a very intense bond.

02:40.041 --> 02:42.417
We were connected at a primal level.

02:42.542 --> 02:46.917
A few days ago
I felt this sensation in my soul.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.291
It dawned on me that something
had happened to my sister.

02:50.375 --> 02:53.417
Then when she didn't arrive
at my home as scheduled,

02:53.500 --> 02:56.417
well, that's when I knew
she was dead.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.458
Honey, no.
You mustn't think like that.

02:59.542 --> 03:05.041
- Martha's only missing.
- No, Edie. She's dead.

03:05.125 --> 03:10.625
But she's my sister and I'm going to
find out exactly what happened to her.

03:11.625 --> 03:16.083
Look, Felicia, it's natural to
freak out when a loved one's missing.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.375
Loved one?

03:18.458 --> 03:22.542
Edie, let me be clear about this.

03:22.625 --> 03:27.625
I hated Martha.
She was a wretched pig of a woman.

03:27.709 --> 03:31.208
The day she died,
this world became a better place.

03:31.291 --> 03:37.500
<i>It was in that moment that Edie</i>
<i>finally saw the family resemblance.</i>

04:22.458 --> 04:24.792
<i>Mrs. Huber was missing.</i>

04:24.917 --> 04:27.166
<i>The words echoed down Wisteria Lane</i>

04:27.250 --> 04:31.291
<i>until every last resident</i>
<i>was aware of her disappearance.</i>

04:31.417 --> 04:34.375
<i>By noon, dozens of neighbors</i>
<i>had gathered.</i>

04:34.750 --> 04:38.875
<i>Some came to volunteer.</i>
<i>Some came in sympathy.</i>

04:38.959 --> 04:43.625
<i>And some came to learn</i>
<i>exactly what the police knew...</i>

04:43.709 --> 04:46.333
<i>and what they didn't.</i>

04:46.417 --> 04:49.959
I'll need you to pass out flyers.
Put 'em in the mall, the park.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.750
Anywhere Mrs. Huber
might have been seen.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.959
We need to jump on this.
Time is of the essence.

04:57.041 --> 05:00.083
Edie, would you like to say something?

05:00.166 --> 05:04.625
On behalf of Martha
and her sister, Felicia...

05:04.709 --> 05:07.458
I'd like to thank you all
for coming here today.

05:07.542 --> 05:13.333
You know, my last conversation
with Martha was one of anger,

05:13.417 --> 05:17.083
and I'll never forgive myself
for the things that I said.

05:17.166 --> 05:20.291
I lay awake at night
thinking about it.

05:26.792 --> 05:30.333
I don't know how, but Edie managed
to make this all about her.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.959
- She's a talented girl, Edie.
- Has anybody talked to Bree?

05:34.041 --> 05:37.041
- How's Rex?
- She's bringing him home today.

05:37.125 --> 05:40.291
I don't know how he had a heart attack.
He was so young.

05:40.375 --> 05:43.709
- How creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?
- I know.

05:43.792 --> 05:47.250
She was talking about Mrs. Huber
like she was already dead.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.959
- You don't think she's...?
- No, I'm sure she's fine.

05:51.083 --> 05:53.208
Mrs. Huber's like a roach.

05:53.291 --> 05:59.542
Everyone on Wisteria Lane is praying
for your sister's safe return.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.500
I seriously doubt that.

06:08.792 --> 06:11.208
You're not taking care of him?

06:11.291 --> 06:14.250
Dad's gotta have a place to recuperate.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.792
He can go to a motel.
He's not allowed back in my house.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.458
You two were getting along.
What happened?

06:20.542 --> 06:23.834
That's between your father and me.

06:23.959 --> 06:28.458
You're selfish. I am so looking forward
to putting you in a nursing home.

06:28.542 --> 06:33.083
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I plan
to have an embolism and to die young.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.375
- You might not be so lucky.
- Andrew...

06:36.500 --> 06:41.083
Know how long I can hold a grudge?
Abandon my father and you'll be sorry.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.750
You wouldn't say that
if you knew what...

06:43.834 --> 06:46.333
Knew what? Come on, tell me.

06:46.458 --> 06:51.000
I'd love to know what my father did
that was so awful.

06:51.125 --> 06:54.333
Fine. I will see him through this,
but after that,

06:54.458 --> 06:57.208
your father can rot in hell
for all I care.

07:00.417 --> 07:03.667
We're not like other families, are we?

07:03.750 --> 07:06.750
No, we're not.

07:06.875 --> 07:10.041
It's not my fault
that your bank accounts are frozen.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.625
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Just fix it.

07:12.709 --> 07:16.375
The folks at the Justice Department
aren't very sympathetic.

07:16.458 --> 07:19.875
I'm running out of money.
I'm gonna be screwed.

07:19.959 --> 07:22.041
Why don't you hock some jewelry?

07:22.166 --> 07:26.166
There's a lot of stuff
you never wear and most of it's ugly.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.291
Don't you have a toilet to scrub?

07:29.375 --> 07:31.792
God, I'm just so angry with Carlos.

07:31.875 --> 07:35.542
What was he thinking,
exporting goods made from slave labor?

07:35.667 --> 07:37.583
Why couldn't he have embezzled?

07:37.667 --> 07:40.583
They want to make sure
he doesn't skip the country.

07:40.667 --> 07:44.750
If he's released on bail, I can argue
that he needs money to live on,

07:44.834 --> 07:48.041
and they'll unfreeze
one of the smaller accounts.

07:48.125 --> 07:50.875
They won't release him
without the passport.

07:50.959 --> 07:54.333
Exactly. You haven't
found that yet, have you?

07:55.542 --> 07:59.583
<i>Gabrielle wanted</i>
<i>her old lifestyle back, no question.</i>

07:59.667 --> 08:05.375
<i>But she wanted Carlos to suffer</i>
<i>for his betrayal even more.</i>

08:05.458 --> 08:07.792
I'm still searching.

08:07.917 --> 08:10.875
You might wanna think
about looking for a job.

08:15.291 --> 08:17.417
- I had a good time.
- I bet you did.

08:22.709 --> 08:23.959
Gotcha!

08:24.917 --> 08:28.041
- Hey. Is this a bad time?
- For you? Of course it is.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.375
Cute. Tax stuff.
I need your signature.

08:30.458 --> 08:33.625
- We've been divorced over a year.
- 2003.

08:33.709 --> 08:36.625
Well, please, just come on in.

08:36.709 --> 08:40.625
Mike, I don't think you've officially
met my ex, Karl Mayer.

08:40.709 --> 08:44.041
- Hey. Mike Delfino.
- Right. The plumber.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.375
I don't have the right washer,

08:47.458 --> 08:51.000
so I'm just gonna go on across
the street and get it.

08:54.291 --> 08:58.291
- So he seems OK.
- Yeah, he is.

08:58.417 --> 09:02.583
So, what do you want me to sign?
I see.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.792
By the way, Julie told me
about her birthday plans.

09:05.875 --> 09:10.250
We're going to a restaurant downtown.
A guy who plays piano and open mic.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.625
Julie got a bunch
of her girlfriends together.

09:13.709 --> 09:16.834
- Julie loves to sing. It sounds nice.
- Here you go.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.875
- All righty.
- Give my best to Brandi.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.500
Actually, we're not together any more.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.709
You're not? What happened?

09:25.792 --> 09:28.083
I caught her in bed
with another guy.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.333
Go ahead. Do your happy dance.

09:32.417 --> 09:37.166
No, no, really. I'm sorry
that you had to go through that. I am.

09:42.709 --> 09:45.500
It's just really hard for me right now.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.709
Thanks.

09:56.458 --> 10:00.542
Try ripping up old photos. It helps.

10:03.041 --> 10:06.500
Well, have fun this weekend.
Let me know how the party goes.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.667
Karl, do you want to join us?

10:16.709 --> 10:18.792
Susan...

10:20.041 --> 10:21.750
You're the best.

10:22.667 --> 10:26.208
Well... yeah. I'm the best, aren't I?

10:33.583 --> 10:38.041
Are we gonna buy a water heater?
We could go to the mall tomorrow.

10:38.125 --> 10:42.000
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- I'm just trying to plan my day.

10:42.083 --> 10:44.583
Please, honey. I'm so tired.

10:46.417 --> 10:48.291
OK.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.333
Hon, did you set up
the coffee maker?

11:01.417 --> 11:07.250
Oh, no. I'll do it in the morning.
I promise I'll get up early and do it.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.291
Tom.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.375
Come on.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.959
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.583
Claire?!

11:55.041 --> 12:00.000
I'm... Wow, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were up.

12:01.250 --> 12:05.917
Yeah, I thought you were sleeping.
I was just going upstairs.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.917
- Do you want me to make the coffee?
- Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.500
I'm just going to, you know,
go back up to my room.

12:20.083 --> 12:23.375
- Night.
- Good night.

12:26.792 --> 12:29.792
If we go to the mall,
we can go to the shoe store.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.583
You said you wanted new running shoes.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.792
What?

12:50.875 --> 12:54.750
<i>The next morning, while the search</i>
<i>for Martha Huber continued,</i>

12:54.834 --> 12:57.583
<i>Lynette discovered</i>
<i>a little family secret,</i>

12:57.667 --> 13:00.041
<i>one she wasn't even looking for.</i>

13:00.208 --> 13:02.417
- Good morning.
- Morning.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.291
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

13:06.083 --> 13:09.333
I didn't want to come down
till Tom left for work.

13:09.417 --> 13:13.291
- I'm still a little embarrassed.
- About what?

13:13.417 --> 13:15.500
He didn't tell you?

13:15.583 --> 13:18.375
Well, actually it's kinda funny.

13:18.458 --> 13:22.000
I was doing some laundry,
and I noticed the robe I was wearing

13:22.083 --> 13:25.000
had some baby food on it,
so I threw it in,

13:25.083 --> 13:28.500
figuring I could dash upstairs
while everyone was asleep,

13:28.583 --> 13:32.792
and then I ran into Tom...
while I was totally naked.

13:37.208 --> 13:42.166
And so, Claire,
when did this... incident occur?

13:42.917 --> 13:45.208
I don't know. It was pretty late.

13:45.291 --> 13:49.834
I think he might have come down
to make coffee or something.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.166
You don't say.

13:55.834 --> 14:00.166
This is certainly impressive. I can
definitely get you work as a model.

14:00.250 --> 14:04.375
You realize it's different from
the work you did in New York and Milan?

14:04.458 --> 14:11.375
Of course. I made $10,000 a day.
I don't expect to make that here.

14:11.458 --> 14:15.208
- That's good, because you won't.
- Yeah. So, what have you got?

14:15.291 --> 14:17.458
Well, there is something.

14:17.583 --> 14:21.208
They need a model to demonstrate
the new Buick LaCrosse

14:21.291 --> 14:23.375
at the Fairview Mall.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.417
It's just you and the car
on a revolving platform.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.625
300 bucks for the day.

14:30.458 --> 14:33.959
- What else do you have?
- Sure.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.834
Can you swing a sword?

14:37.917 --> 14:42.750
Sci-fi convention needs someone
to dress up as a warrior princess.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.750
A warrior princess?

14:45.834 --> 14:50.125
Mr. Gibb, I am a professional model.

14:50.208 --> 14:53.542
Look at this bone structure.
This face is a cash cow.

14:53.625 --> 14:57.583
And if you don't have the vision,
then maybe I'm at the wrong agency.

14:57.667 --> 15:01.667
Look, honey, I'm the only modeling
agent in a hundred-mile radius.

15:01.792 --> 15:04.667
I book women for boat shows
and garden-tool expos.

15:04.750 --> 15:08.375
If you don't like it,
move back to the city.

15:12.166 --> 15:17.417
This Buick thing,
does it include lunch?

15:22.041 --> 15:26.709
Just so you know, I really am grateful
for everything you're doing for me.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.917
I don't need your gratitude.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.625
You're here because your children
are master extortionists.

15:32.709 --> 15:35.417
- You didn't tell 'em about...
- Your adultery?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.875
No, I decided to keep
that little gem all to myself.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.375
I know this is a real imposition...

15:41.458 --> 15:44.333
It is. The doctor said
you could be here for weeks.

15:44.417 --> 15:48.875
Would it make you feel any better
if I told you I'm sorry for what I did?

15:48.959 --> 15:52.333
Yes, it would...
if I still felt anything for you.

15:52.417 --> 15:55.375
But as it stands,
the place you occupied in my heart

15:55.458 --> 15:58.250
is very much empty now.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.917
You must still feel something for me.

16:01.875 --> 16:05.375
- And why do you think that?
- Come on, Bree. Look at this.

16:05.458 --> 16:10.333
The good china, freshly pressed
napkins, flowers from the garden.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.792
This tray was prepared
with loving care.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.750
Do me a favor, Rex.

16:14.875 --> 16:19.041
Please don't mistake my anal
retentiveness for actual affection.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.875
Hold on a sec.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.667
OK. Now I'm good.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.667
- What?
- You're just... God, I love you.

16:49.625 --> 16:52.291
Well... that's great.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.792
Wait, look. That just kinda popped out.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.542
No, no, it's fine.
It just kinda caught me off guard.

16:58.625 --> 17:02.500
- I mean, I wanna say it back...
- Yeah, but you're not ready. It's OK.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.000
- You're not mad, are you?
- No. God.

17:05.083 --> 17:09.375
We haven't been dating that long
and you've got other issues. I get it.

17:11.542 --> 17:13.959
What kind of issues
do you think I have?

17:14.041 --> 17:17.083
I retract my earlier statement.
I no longer love you.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.583
- I just think of you as a good buddy.
- No.

17:19.667 --> 17:23.041
You obviously think you have
some insight into my soul,

17:23.125 --> 17:25.041
so go ahead, dazzle me.

17:25.166 --> 17:29.834
- Your divorce left you vulnerable.
- Big insight. The postman knows that.

17:29.959 --> 17:33.417
And there's a chance
you still have feelings for your ex.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.834
What?

17:35.917 --> 17:39.500
I loathe Karl. And the postman
will back me up on that, too.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.667
I'm sure part of you does hate him,

17:41.750 --> 17:44.333
but maybe part of you's
still hung up on him.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.542
Where are you getting this?

17:46.625 --> 17:48.959
He broke up with the woman
he left you for

17:49.041 --> 17:53.625
and the first thing you did was
hugged him and invited him to a party.

17:53.709 --> 17:58.917
OK. The analysis part
of this evening is now over.

18:00.375 --> 18:04.625
- Hey... you asked.
- Well, you know what?

18:04.709 --> 18:08.333
You're gonna come to Julie's party
and see Karl and I together,

18:08.417 --> 18:11.875
and you're gonna understand
that I have no feelings for him.

18:11.959 --> 18:15.792
- I have tickets to a basketball game.
- You're coming to the party.

18:15.875 --> 18:18.291
This is what I get
for saying "I love you".

18:18.375 --> 18:19.917
- What?
- Nothing.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.709
- Thanks.
- Hello, George.

18:25.792 --> 18:28.083
Mrs. Van De Kamp.
You're looking lovely.

18:28.166 --> 18:32.917
- You always say the nicest things.
- Well, it's true.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.125
Listen, I have a prescription here
for Rex. He had a heart attack.

18:38.208 --> 18:41.083
- I had no idea. Is he OK?
- Yes, he'll live.

18:41.166 --> 18:46.583
But the doctor says he's at risk
for something called pericarditis.

18:46.667 --> 18:51.667
It's an inflammation of the membrane
that surrounds the heart.

18:51.750 --> 18:55.083
- He'll need constant care.
- So I hear.

18:55.208 --> 18:59.375
<i>As the words "constant care"</i>
<i>echoed in her head,</i>

18:59.458 --> 19:02.834
<i>Bree caught a sickening glimpse</i>
<i>into her future...</i>

19:03.625 --> 19:05.583
OK, here we go.

19:05.667 --> 19:09.250
<i>...which prompted her to seek</i>
<i>an old-fashioned remedy.</i>

19:09.959 --> 19:13.000
George, would you
go out to dinner with me?

19:13.083 --> 19:18.000
- You mean, like a date?
- Yes. I think it would be fun.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.500
What about your husband?

19:20.583 --> 19:23.000
Oh, him.

19:23.083 --> 19:26.834
Well, we're...separated.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.625
<i>In spite of Mrs. Huber's disappearance,</i>

19:33.709 --> 19:36.959
<i>life on Wisteria Lane</i>
<i>started to return to normal,</i>

19:37.083 --> 19:43.792
<i>until an intriguing discovery was made</i>
<i>on a dirt road next to the interstate.</i>

19:44.667 --> 19:49.542
I have an abandoned vehicle registered
to a missing person, one Martha Huber.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.667
Please advise.

19:53.417 --> 19:56.417
<i>As news spread</i>
<i>of this mysterious development,</i>

19:56.500 --> 20:00.750
<i>everyone in the neighborhood</i>
<i>decided to band together</i>

20:00.834 --> 20:05.750
<i>to show their support,</i>
<i>and to look for clues, or worse.</i>

20:05.834 --> 20:08.000
I'm keeping my eyes on the horizon.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.542
Tell me if I am about to step
on a body part.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.667
It's a search and rescue.
We don't know if she's dead.

20:13.792 --> 20:16.083
People fake abductions all the time.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.917
Can we talk about
something less depressing?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, here's something.
Mike told me he loved me.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.917
- Oh, my God!
- Over here! They found the body!

20:25.000 --> 20:27.625
I'm sorry, false alarm.
We didn't find a body.

20:27.709 --> 20:30.834
Ah, Susan just had
some really good news.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.500
- Sorry.
- False alarm.

20:34.583 --> 20:39.000
Well, doesn't that figure? Susan always
finds a way to make it about her.

20:41.667 --> 20:46.166
Ladies and gentleman, I present
to you the fabulous Buick LaCrosse.

20:51.125 --> 20:54.750
It has an expertly crafted interior,

20:55.959 --> 21:00.875
peaceful Quiet Tuning
and ultrasonic rear parking assist.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.208
Observe the remote activation feature.

21:10.500 --> 21:14.250
And it also has a lot of
other exciting, good, cool car things.

21:31.917 --> 21:35.542
Tom! Lynette!
What are you doing here?

21:35.625 --> 21:38.250
Buying a new water heater.
How about you?

21:38.375 --> 21:40.458
Just doing a little shopping.

21:40.542 --> 21:43.000
Gaby, you need help? You're stuck.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.041
- I guess I am.
- I got it.

21:45.125 --> 21:47.583
Guess I got too close to the turntable.

21:47.709 --> 21:51.959
- I'm a sucker for these Buicks.
- Come on, you bastard!

21:52.041 --> 21:57.041
With their perfectly crafted interior
and peaceful Quiet Tuning.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.250
A little formal for the mall.

22:01.834 --> 22:05.583
You know, I wanted to match
the shoes to the dress.

22:07.166 --> 22:13.208
This is Sarah, my shopping buddy.
We like to hit the boutiques together.

22:13.959 --> 22:19.583
OK. Well, you gals shop
your little hearts out. See you later.

22:19.667 --> 22:21.709
Bye!

22:31.417 --> 22:34.667
Wow. Look at you. You going out?

22:34.792 --> 22:38.625
Not that it's any of your business,
but I have a date.

22:38.709 --> 22:40.792
A date? What kind of date?

22:40.917 --> 22:43.875
I don't want to say anything
that might upset you.

22:43.959 --> 22:48.625
The doctor says any undue stress
could cause another heart attack.

22:52.041 --> 22:56.834
It's a romantic date with a single man.
I intend to French the hell out of him.

22:58.291 --> 23:00.375
Oh. Right on time.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.166
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:04.291 --> 23:07.667
In my spare time I garden.
I thought you might like these.

23:07.750 --> 23:11.375
They're exquisite.
Compost and eggs shells?

23:11.458 --> 23:14.250
- Yes.
- Come on in.

23:14.333 --> 23:15.583
Thanks.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.125
George, you remember Rex.

23:22.500 --> 23:26.041
- You said you were separated.
- We are, emotionally.

23:26.125 --> 23:29.667
He lives here because
his mistress refuses to care for him.

23:29.750 --> 23:34.250
- Would you like a drink?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.542
Rex, say hello to George.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.208
- Hello, George.
- Hello, Dr Van De Kamp.

23:39.291 --> 23:45.166
I'm gonna put these in water. George,
have a seat and I'll be right back.

23:53.792 --> 23:56.542
So, how's your heart, Dr Van De Kamp?

23:56.667 --> 23:59.917
- Better. How's the pharmacy?
- Busy. It's busy.

24:07.208 --> 24:10.959
- Is something funny?
- It's nothing.

24:11.041 --> 24:16.291
See, I recently engaged
in some extra-curricular activity,

24:16.417 --> 24:20.083
and now Bree's doing
anything she can to make me suffer.

24:20.208 --> 24:24.083
- All you can do is laugh.
- Yeah, I guess.

24:25.083 --> 24:30.291
These flowers are stunning.
They're the best ones I've ever gotten.

24:34.333 --> 24:37.458
- Shall we?
- Nice talking to you, Dr Van De Kamp.

24:37.583 --> 24:40.250
Please, you're dating my wife.
Call me Rex.

24:45.583 --> 24:49.000
That salesgirl that sold us the heater
had a cute figure.

24:49.083 --> 24:52.166
- I guess. I didn't notice.
- She was so your type.

24:52.250 --> 24:55.667
- Big breasts. Really curvy.
- What are you doing?

24:55.750 --> 24:59.625
I'm saying you prefer women
who are curvy, like that salesgirl...

24:59.750 --> 25:02.125
or Claire.

25:02.208 --> 25:05.458
There's only one type
that I prefer: you.

25:05.542 --> 25:09.792
You kissed me as though that would end
this conversation, and it so won't.

25:09.917 --> 25:11.959
Why am I in trouble?

25:12.041 --> 25:16.750
You made love to me the other night
because you had just seen Claire naked.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.166
Crap.

25:21.291 --> 25:25.166
Claire is a great nanny. It would
be stupid to lose her over this.

25:25.250 --> 25:29.750
You and I have had crushes before. We
always tell each other, laugh about it.

25:29.834 --> 25:32.875
What worries me is
you're denying you're attracted.

25:32.959 --> 25:35.875
- I'm not denying anything.
- So you are attracted?

25:36.000 --> 25:40.250
I didn't say that.
What are you doing?

25:40.333 --> 25:44.458
We are not moving until you confess
you have the hots for our nanny.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.208
Tom, it's OK. She's attractive.

25:47.291 --> 25:52.166
Men are drawn to fertile, young women
with whom they can plant their seed.

25:52.291 --> 25:56.834
It's the basic flaw of your gender.
I get it. Just do me the honor...

25:59.500 --> 26:02.875
We'd all like to get out of here.
Is there a problem?

26:02.959 --> 26:06.083
My husband won't admit
that he has lust in his heart.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.667
Can you give us a minute?

26:10.709 --> 26:14.500
Lynette, Claire is attractive, yes.

26:15.667 --> 26:18.333
But I am not attracted to her.

26:18.417 --> 26:23.917
If there was any danger in having
Claire around, I'd get rid of her.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.208
It's you. You're the one.

26:27.333 --> 26:30.041
You always have been
and you always will be.

26:33.667 --> 26:37.000
All right! Hold your water!

26:49.375 --> 26:52.917
- You guys were fantastic.
- Thank you.

26:53.041 --> 26:55.250
They've got a dance floor upstairs.

26:55.375 --> 26:58.375
OK. Have fun.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.583
- Edie, over here!
- What the hell is she doing here?

27:04.709 --> 27:08.166
I don't get to bring a date?
I heard you were bringing him.

27:08.250 --> 27:11.250
Of all people,
you pick that tired piece of... Edie!

27:11.333 --> 27:14.750
Hi, Susan.
Thank you so much for the invite.

27:14.834 --> 27:18.083
I needed something
to get my mind off poor Martha.

27:18.166 --> 27:21.083
A kiss for the birthday boy.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.625
Edie, it's not his birthday.

27:38.041 --> 27:40.792
Thank you, George.
That was a lovely evening.

27:40.917 --> 27:45.083
The pleasure was mine. There's nothing
better than great conversation

27:45.208 --> 27:48.166
with a beautiful woman
over a delicious meal.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.166
Well, I guess I should go inside.

27:53.291 --> 27:56.291
- I'm glad we did this.
- Me too.

28:01.458 --> 28:04.375
Andrew. Where did you come from?

28:04.458 --> 28:08.583
I was just on my way back from
Brian's house. What's going on here?

28:08.667 --> 28:11.333
You remember Mr. Williams,
our pharmacist?

28:11.417 --> 28:13.542
- Hey there.
- How's it going?

28:13.625 --> 28:17.792
- What are you doing in his car?
- We're just talking.

28:18.709 --> 28:21.250
Mr. Williams took me out to dinner.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.125
You mean like on a date?

28:29.667 --> 28:31.166
Yes.

28:31.333 --> 28:34.166
You are aware
that she's married, right?

28:34.250 --> 28:36.583
Your father and I are separated.

28:36.667 --> 28:39.333
Couldn't you wait
until he was out of the house?

28:39.500 --> 28:42.875
He's only in the house
because you insisted I care for him.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.834
So what are you guys gonna do now?
Are you two gonna have sex?

28:46.917 --> 28:49.208
- No, we are not!
- Why not?

28:49.333 --> 28:52.917
Because I don't commit adultery
like your father!

28:57.875 --> 29:00.750
Your father had an affair.
I found out about it.

29:00.834 --> 29:03.125
I'm just trying to move on
with my life.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.291
You should watch out for her.
She's a liar.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.083
<i>In spite of her mounting debt,</i>
<i>Gabrielle was determined to prove</i>

29:27.166 --> 29:31.750
<i>she could get along just fine</i>
<i>without Carlos's money.</i>

29:33.625 --> 29:36.792
<i>It wasn't until</i>
<i>the electricity went out</i>

29:36.875 --> 29:39.875
<i>that she finally</i>
<i>began to see the light.</i>

29:50.583 --> 29:53.875
Mr. Hartley, it's Gabrielle Solis.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.417
I need you to start working
on releasing Carlos on bail.

29:59.625 --> 30:02.750
I just remembered
where I put his passport.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.792
Thank you!

30:47.875 --> 30:52.125
Damn, woman. You are good.

30:52.792 --> 30:55.709
Yes! All right, you're next, Susie-Q.

30:55.792 --> 30:57.875
- What you gonna sing?
- Yes!

30:57.959 --> 31:00.000
- You sing?
- Only when I'm alone.

31:00.083 --> 31:02.583
- We're among friends.
- I don't think so.

31:02.667 --> 31:05.709
I for one would love
to hear your voice.

31:05.792 --> 31:09.208
Give it up, plumber.
She's not budging.

31:09.291 --> 31:11.417
- You wanna hear me sing?
- Yeah.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.500
What's it gonna be?
I'll tell the piano player.

31:19.583 --> 31:23.500
<i>- New York, New York.</i>
- I am so excited to hear you.

31:23.583 --> 31:27.166
- But doesn't it just figure?
- What do you mean?

31:27.291 --> 31:31.792
You have to get up in front of a room
full of people dressed like that.

31:31.875 --> 31:34.959
I hope they don't turn on you.

31:35.041 --> 31:39.709
I think I'll take my chances. Sort of
like you did on those high notes.

31:39.792 --> 31:42.792
- I'm gonna get us two more.
- That's a great idea.

31:43.834 --> 31:48.917
- So Mike seems pretty even-keeled.
- Yeah. He's a great guy.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.667
But, you know, I mean,
he's a little Buster Brown.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.875
Don't you worry you'll get bored?

31:54.959 --> 31:57.083
Thanks for your concern. I'm fine.

31:57.166 --> 32:02.375
Go figure. Even though our marriage
was crazy at times, it never got dull.

32:02.458 --> 32:06.500
That part when you slept with
your secretary was really exciting.

32:06.583 --> 32:10.625
I know. How many times
do I have to hear it? It was a mistake.

32:10.709 --> 32:14.959
But don't I ever get credit
for the 13 loyal years beforehand?

32:15.041 --> 32:18.291
Not counting
the Hendersons' Christmas party.

32:18.375 --> 32:21.208
- Edie, not now.
- What's the big deal, Karl?

32:21.291 --> 32:24.000
- Your marriage is history, anyway.
- Edie...

32:24.083 --> 32:25.750
It was nothing, really.

32:25.834 --> 32:28.375
Basically, we both
got plastered on eggnog

32:28.542 --> 32:32.166
and we found ourselves
standing under the mistletoe,

32:32.250 --> 32:35.041
and we were like,
"OK, so what do we do now?"

32:35.125 --> 32:39.083
So I smiled and he smiled

32:39.166 --> 32:43.250
and then Karl reached over
and started feeling me up.

32:43.333 --> 32:45.959
- That's not how it happened.
- You're up.

32:46.041 --> 32:48.208
This is... It's so silly. Susie...

32:48.291 --> 32:51.917
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Susan Mayer.

33:03.583 --> 33:07.750
<i>Start spreading the news</i>

33:07.834 --> 33:11.166
<i>I'm leaving today</i>

33:11.250 --> 33:15.083
<i>I wanna be a part of it</i>

33:15.166 --> 33:18.375
<i>New York, New York</i>

33:18.500 --> 33:21.208
<i>These vagabond shoes...</i>

33:21.291 --> 33:24.000
You're an ass, you know that?
No, keep playing.

33:24.083 --> 33:26.333
<i>Are longing to stray</i>

33:26.458 --> 33:28.333
There's a word you know.

33:28.417 --> 33:31.792
<i>And get around the heart of it</i>

33:31.917 --> 33:35.875
<i>New York, New York</i>

33:35.959 --> 33:37.333
<i>I wanna...</i>

33:37.417 --> 33:40.250
...just tell you that the affair
was one thing.

33:40.333 --> 33:44.291
I forgave you because I thought
that you were in love with her,

33:44.375 --> 33:48.208
and now I find out you were
just groping people at parties!

33:48.291 --> 33:51.041
<i>Top of the heap...</i>

33:51.125 --> 33:54.417
Karl, don't you turn away from me.
Look at me!

33:56.125 --> 34:00.500
During our marriage, how many
other women were you sticking it to?

34:00.625 --> 34:03.583
As God as my witness,
it will snow on the hills of hell

34:03.667 --> 34:06.500
before I ever feel sorry for you again!

34:13.709 --> 34:16.375
<i>New York!</i>

34:20.000 --> 34:23.291
<i>As the police interviewed</i>
<i>the residents of Wisteria Lane</i>

34:23.375 --> 34:27.083
<i>about the mysterious disappearance</i>
<i>of Martha Huber,</i>

34:27.166 --> 34:30.917
<i>my husband Paul reasoned</i>
<i>it would only be a matter of time</i>

34:31.000 --> 34:34.917
<i>before their digging</i>
<i>would begin to yield answers.</i>

34:56.625 --> 34:59.291
<i>Since he knew</i>
<i>the police had no suspects...</i>

35:01.834 --> 35:06.500
<i>...he decided to point them</i>
<i>towards the most logical candidate.</i>

35:10.667 --> 35:15.083
<i>You see, if there's one thing</i>
<i>Paul understood about the suburbs,</i>

35:15.166 --> 35:17.542
<i>it was this:</i>

35:17.625 --> 35:21.208
<i>no one's ever more suspicious</i>

35:21.291 --> 35:25.583
<i>than a new neighbor</i>
<i>who's just moved in.</i>

35:29.667 --> 35:33.333
- Parker's getting sniffly.
- Yeah, I noticed that too.

35:33.417 --> 35:35.667
I hope he's not
coming down with a cold.

35:35.750 --> 35:41.583
He doesn't have a cough yet, but he has
this post nasal drip thing happening.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.959
I'll make an appointment for him.

35:44.083 --> 35:47.291
I always say
it is better to be safe than sorry.

35:47.417 --> 35:51.583
Little kids get sick,
and it's, sorry, out of control.

35:55.041 --> 36:00.250
And kids with these colds,
it's just a vicious cycle.

36:15.125 --> 36:17.625
Claire?

36:20.625 --> 36:23.542
We have to make some changes.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.333
What are you doing?

36:28.417 --> 36:31.792
Packing up your father's things
for when he moves out.

36:31.875 --> 36:34.375
Here, let me help you.

36:36.834 --> 36:39.709
Look, I talked to Dad,

36:39.792 --> 36:42.917
and it turns out
you were telling the truth.

36:45.625 --> 36:48.917
Andrew, I'm so sorry
that I said anything.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.792
No, I'm glad you did. Now I know.

36:52.875 --> 36:55.875
There comes this point
in every boy's life.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
What? Find out his dad's
screwing around?

36:59.792 --> 37:02.709
No. That his father's only human.

37:04.959 --> 37:07.000
So why are you taking care of him?

37:07.125 --> 37:10.917
Because of what Danielle and I said?
Because you can forget that.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.625
- I'll help take his stuff out.
- That's sweet.

37:13.709 --> 37:17.500
But I'm taking care of him
because it's the right thing to do.

37:17.625 --> 37:20.208
Why are you being
such a pushover?

37:20.333 --> 37:23.458
I mean, he cheated on you. He's a jerk.

37:23.542 --> 37:29.208
Andrew, you will not speak that way
about your father in front of me.

37:29.333 --> 37:32.792
Why the hell not? I mean,
for once I'm actually on your side.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.959
Yes, I'm angry with him.
I am gonna divorce him.

37:36.041 --> 37:38.458
I may even marry somebody else,

37:38.542 --> 37:42.250
but your father is and always will be
the love of my life.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.750
He gave me
the best 18-year marriage that...

37:49.625 --> 37:51.709
...I could have ever hoped for.

37:55.041 --> 37:58.375
And for that you will respect him.

38:19.542 --> 38:23.542
- What is it? I'm really, really busy.
- I came by to apologize.

38:23.625 --> 38:28.834
Oh. Well, in that case, come on in.
I'm not doing anything.

38:32.250 --> 38:36.000
I can't believe
Edie brought the whole thing up.

38:36.083 --> 38:40.917
Susan, I am so sorry.
I thought I was done hurting you.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.083
Yeah, me too.

38:44.583 --> 38:49.458
And just so you know,
I'm sorry for flipping out.

38:49.583 --> 38:51.917
I shouldn't let you
get to me like that.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.583
- What?
- I do still get to you, don't I?

38:57.667 --> 39:00.583
That's the difference
between the plumber and me.

39:00.667 --> 39:04.208
Don't get me wrong,
he's a good guy. I like him.

39:04.291 --> 39:07.500
But I'm betting you two
don't have what we had together.

39:07.625 --> 39:10.417
There was always a spark between us.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.291
A spark?

39:12.417 --> 39:16.458
Look, what I'm trying to say is
he must seem really safe after me.

39:16.583 --> 39:19.500
A moray eel would seem safe after you.

39:21.417 --> 39:26.583
That's what I'm talking about, that
great back and forth, joking around.

39:26.667 --> 39:30.041
We used to argue
and push each other's buttons.

39:30.125 --> 39:32.542
Newsflash: I hated all of that.

39:32.625 --> 39:36.959
Come on. You have to admit,
when it was good, it was the best.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.458
What are you saying?

39:40.542 --> 39:44.458
Let's give this another shot.

39:44.542 --> 39:47.667
- You want me back?
- Yeah.

39:47.750 --> 39:52.959
Yeah. I realize now
that you were the woman...

39:54.250 --> 39:57.250
...that was meant for me.

39:57.333 --> 39:59.417
Wow.

40:00.542 --> 40:04.208
Just so we're clear,
so you want to move back in here

40:04.333 --> 40:08.709
and be faithful to me and love me
with all your heart and soul?

40:10.000 --> 40:13.917
- Absolutely.
- Oh, my God, this is so wonderful.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.333
Yeah. I know, I know.

40:17.583 --> 40:21.375
- I wanna kiss you.
- Oh, God. No, Karl.

40:21.500 --> 40:25.166
No. What I meant by wonderful
is that I wondered inside

40:25.250 --> 40:29.375
if I still had feelings for you,
if deep down I still loved you.

40:29.458 --> 40:34.000
- And?
- And...there's nothing there.

40:34.083 --> 40:38.959
- Come on, you've gotta feel something.
- Well, actually, I do. Yeah.

40:39.041 --> 40:43.125
Excuse me. Oh, boy!

40:57.959 --> 41:01.709
- Susan.
- Mike, guess what? I love you.

41:01.792 --> 41:05.083
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

41:11.291 --> 41:16.083
- Did I come at a bad time?
- They're just asking about Mrs. Huber.

41:16.959 --> 41:20.792
I love him.
You can write that in your little book.

41:24.417 --> 41:27.125
<i>We are all searching for someone,</i>

41:27.208 --> 41:32.750
<i>that special person who will provide us</i>
<i>what's missing in our lives.</i>

41:32.834 --> 41:35.083
<i>Someone who can offer companionship.</i>

41:35.166 --> 41:38.375
George? Hi, it's me, Bree.

41:39.625 --> 41:43.083
I was wondering,
are you free next Saturday?

41:43.166 --> 41:45.792
You are? Oh, that's wonderful.

41:45.875 --> 41:47.333
<i>Or assistance.</i>

41:47.458 --> 41:51.375
Hi, I understand
your agency handles nannies.

41:51.458 --> 41:55.750
I need someone experienced
and preferably unattractive.

41:57.959 --> 41:59.375
<i>Or security.</i>

41:59.458 --> 42:02.583
Hi, honey. Did the lawyer
tell you the good news?

42:02.667 --> 42:06.959
You're gonna make bail.
I found your passport.

42:07.041 --> 42:11.792
<i>And sometimes, if we search very hard,</i>
<i>we can find someone who provides us...</i>

42:11.875 --> 42:14.709
I just called to say hi,
and I love you.

42:14.792 --> 42:16.667
<i>...with all three.</i>

42:16.792 --> 42:20.125
All right, all right. Enough already.

42:23.959 --> 42:27.333
<i>Yes, we're all searching for someone.</i>

42:27.417 --> 42:33.417
<i>And if we can't find them,</i>
<i>we can only pray they find us.</i>

42:33.500 --> 42:35.583
What you got, boy?
