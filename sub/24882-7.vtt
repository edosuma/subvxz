00:15.133 --> 00:17.500
Oh, hi!
Today on "Sesame Street,"

00:17.500 --> 00:19.266
we're finding out about
the alphabet.

00:19.266 --> 00:21.333
And I was just checking
my mail.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.066
Ooh, I got a letter.

00:24.066 --> 00:28.533
It's the letter "B,"
my favorite letter.

00:28.533 --> 00:29.767
Do you know why?

00:29.767 --> 00:32.533
Because "B" makes
the "buh" sound,

00:32.533 --> 00:35.266
as in Big Bird. Ha!

00:35.266 --> 00:38.667
Keep watching for more
of the alphabet today
on "Sesame Street."

00:38.667 --> 00:43.467
"Buh." Boy, I love getting
letters in the mail, don't you?

00:43.467 --> 00:45.166
Ha ha ha!

00:45.166 --> 00:47.834

Nice job.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.567
Oh, hi!
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.600
Kids and monsters:
Hi!

01:44.600 --> 01:45.667
- Who wants to go play?
- I do!

01:45.667 --> 01:49.033
- Oh, play! Play!
- Bye.

01:49.033 --> 01:52.200
Elmo's gonna stay here
and finish his picture, see?

01:52.200 --> 01:54.400
Aw. Que bonito,  Elmo.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.834
Oh, gracias,  Rosita.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.600
Oh. It says
Elmo's name. See?

01:58.600 --> 02:02.233
E-L-M-O.

02:02.233 --> 02:05.600
Rosita:
Hey! What--
where did the "M" go?

02:05.600 --> 02:08.300
I don't know.
It just disappeared.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.233
Hey, look!

02:10.233 --> 02:12.300
Nina:
The "M" disappeared
from the alphabet, too.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.567
Hubba-wha?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.834
Well,
this is so strange!

02:15.834 --> 02:17.667
- Hang on.
- Elmo: What's the matter?

02:17.667 --> 02:19.433
- Wait a minute.
- Rosita: What? What?

02:19.433 --> 02:21.500
Look at
the laundromat sign.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.800
( Rosita gasps )
¡Ay, mama!

02:23.800 --> 02:25.700
Elmo:
Elmo, mama!
There it goes.

02:27.066 --> 02:30.000
Oh, and over there on
the Sesame Street sign.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.200
The letter "M" is
disappearing from everywhere.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.266
Why is this happening?!

02:34.266 --> 02:36.500
Grover:
Aah! Hi-ya! Ooh!

02:36.500 --> 02:38.000
( chuckles )

02:38.000 --> 02:41.767
Have no fear.
Super Grover is... wait.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.266
Where am I?
What? Where did I go?

02:43.266 --> 02:44.533
Ha ha ha!

02:44.533 --> 02:47.800
Ah, yes.
Super Grover is here!

02:47.800 --> 02:50.367
- What seems to be the problem?
- Oh, well, Super Grover...

02:50.367 --> 02:52.834
- Aah! Ooh, ooh.
- The letter "M" is missing.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.567
- Yeah, it just disappeared.
- Uh-huh.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.734
Yeah, and we don't know
where it went.

02:56.734 --> 02:59.467
Ah, well, luckily,
you know someone

02:59.467 --> 03:01.633
who is
a letter-finding expert.

03:01.633 --> 03:04.266
- We do? Who?
- Me.

03:04.266 --> 03:06.867
I'm talking about me--
Super Grover.

03:06.867 --> 03:10.066
I will find your missing letter
"M" for you.

03:10.066 --> 03:12.533
Boy, Elmo hopes Super Grover
finds the letter "M."

03:12.533 --> 03:15.433
Actually, I think I'm going
to start looking over this way.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.867
Yeah, because this is
a big problem.

03:17.867 --> 03:21.600
I'll say.
It's a big problem!

03:21.600 --> 03:23.500
Listen what happened
to my cows.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.600
They can't say "moo" anymore.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.233
- Cows: Ooo!
- Farmer: See?

03:28.233 --> 03:31.367
Without the letter "M"
to make the "Mmm" sound,

03:31.367 --> 03:33.300
all they can say is...

03:33.300 --> 03:34.567
- Cows: Ooo!
- Farmer: Ooo.

03:34.567 --> 03:35.767
Elmo:
Ha ha ha!

03:35.767 --> 03:39.633
Oh, cows aren't supposed
to say "Ooo"!

03:39.633 --> 03:40.934
Grover:
Do not worry.

03:40.934 --> 03:44.166
I, your hero, have found
the missing letter.

03:44.166 --> 03:47.533
Oh, oh, but that is not
the letter "M."

03:47.533 --> 03:49.233
- Elmo: Uh-uh.
- It is not?

03:49.233 --> 03:51.200
No. I'm the letter "B."

03:51.200 --> 03:53.533
Right. The letter "M"
has straight lines

03:53.533 --> 03:56.000
that go up,
down, up, down.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.233
Uh-huh.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.967
But as you can see, every letter
"M" just disappears.

03:59.967 --> 04:01.633
Oh, "B" is also
a letter.

04:01.633 --> 04:04.100
Just use it instead
of the "M." Problem solved.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.567
No, that won't work.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.433
The letter "B" makes
a different sound than
the letter "M."

04:07.433 --> 04:08.767
She's right.

04:08.767 --> 04:10.333
I make the "buh" sound.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.800
Yeah, and the "M"
makes the "mmm" sound.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.066
Yeah, if you change the letter,
you change the word.

04:16.066 --> 04:18.200
- Yeah.
- Like, instead of saying "moo,"

04:18.200 --> 04:19.567
these cows would say...

04:19.567 --> 04:20.767
Boo!

04:20.767 --> 04:22.300
You startled me.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.867
- Boo!
- Aah! Don't do that.

04:23.867 --> 04:26.567
Well, "boo" does rhyme
with "moo."

04:26.567 --> 04:28.400
Yeah, the end of the word
sounds the same,

04:28.400 --> 04:30.433
but with a different letter
at the beginning,

04:30.433 --> 04:31.767
it's not the same word.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.266
- Boo!
- Aah!

04:33.266 --> 04:34.500
I got to get out of here.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.066
- Boo!
- Oh! My heart! Gah!

04:37.066 --> 04:38.834
- Boo! Boo!
- Farmer: Aah!

04:40.300 --> 04:42.266
( stuttering )
Well, how about
we just use "B"

04:42.266 --> 04:44.367
instead of "M"
in the middle of words?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.266
It'll still sound different.

04:46.266 --> 04:48.266
Right. Es cierto.

04:48.266 --> 04:52.600
Like Elmo's name with a "B"
in it would be Elbo.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.367
Elbo? No!
That doesn't sound right.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.467
No, we definitely need
the letter "M."

04:58.467 --> 05:00.767
And, luckily,
you already have someone

05:00.767 --> 05:03.767
with a brilliant mind
already on the case.

05:03.767 --> 05:06.133
- We do? Who?
- Me.

05:06.133 --> 05:08.433
Again,
I am talking about me.

05:08.433 --> 05:12.300
I, your hero, shall go and find
the letter "M" for you.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.233
Oh, Grover,
don't forget the letter "B."

05:14.233 --> 05:16.700
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Elbo.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.600
- Elmo! Hee hee!
- Bye-bye. Adios.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.100
Bye.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.834
I wonder if anybody else
has noticed the letter "M"
is missing.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.734
Alan:
The letter "M" is missing!

05:24.734 --> 05:27.734
- I guess so.
- Come on! Let's go
check it out.

05:27.734 --> 05:29.233
Rosita:
Wait for me.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.934
( gasping ) Telly,
I don't understand it.

05:31.934 --> 05:35.266
The letter "M" was
on this container of milk,

05:35.266 --> 05:37.600
but then it just disappeared.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.333
Without the letter "M,"
milk is just "ilk"

05:41.333 --> 05:43.767
and who wants
to drink that?

05:43.767 --> 05:46.200
The letter "M" seems to be
disappearing from everywhere.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.200
- Yeah.
- Worry not, for I,

05:48.200 --> 05:50.567
Super Grover, have found
the missing "M."

05:50.567 --> 05:52.367
You are welcome.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.367
Uh, Grover,
that's the letter "N."

05:55.367 --> 05:58.066
Yeah. Uh, remember
how I said an "M" has lines

05:58.066 --> 06:00.467
that go up, down,
up, down?

06:00.467 --> 06:03.133
Yes! And as you can see,
this letter also has lines

06:03.133 --> 06:07.300
that go up, down,
up-- oh, boy. Um...

06:07.300 --> 06:09.066
I'm guessing this is not
the letter "M."

06:09.066 --> 06:11.834
Um, no. I'm an "N."

06:11.834 --> 06:14.567
People confuse me with "M"
all the time.

06:14.567 --> 06:16.533
You do look
somewhat alike. Heh.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.900
Yeah, but I make
the "nnn" sound,

06:19.900 --> 06:23.066
and "M" makes
the "mmm" sound.

06:23.066 --> 06:24.767
Oh, close enough!

06:24.767 --> 06:26.967
Let's just put the "N" where
the "M" should go

06:26.967 --> 06:28.200
and call it a day, huh?

06:28.200 --> 06:29.500
No, no, no.
That's not going to work.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.567
Yeah, remember,
a different letter

06:31.567 --> 06:33.200
changes the word.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.367
Yeah, if we use
"N" instead of "M,"

06:36.367 --> 06:39.633
my milk will become nilk.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.867
And look what happens
to my cows.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.700
Instead of "moo,"
now they say...

06:44.700 --> 06:47.266
Cows: Noo!

06:47.266 --> 06:49.734
Noo? What's noo?

06:49.734 --> 06:52.700
Not much.
What's new with you?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.633
( cows and Grover laughing )

06:54.633 --> 06:56.200
- Grover: That's a good one.
- All right.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.100
This is out of control.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.100
We need our letter "M" back.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.633
Grover:
All right. All right.

07:01.633 --> 07:05.767
I can see that you need a real
hero to set things right.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.166
Yes, but who?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.567
Me! I am talking about--
what am I, chopped liver?

07:10.567 --> 07:12.033
See the cape?

07:12.033 --> 07:14.333
The costume with the cute
little lightning bolt
and everything?

07:14.333 --> 07:16.033
Oh, come on.
Letter "N," time to go.

07:16.033 --> 07:17.567
All right.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.767
I will have to find the letter
"M" for real this time.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.166
Aah.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.934
- Umph!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:23.934 --> 07:25.567
That's my lunch. Oh!

07:25.567 --> 07:28.033
Can you please get
these cows out of here?

07:28.033 --> 07:30.300
All right. Ahem!
Back to the farm.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.967
Excuse Elmo.

07:31.967 --> 07:34.400
And I won't take "noo"
for an answer.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.367
- Ow! Ow! My foot.
- Sorry about that.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.333
- ( Elmo chuckles )
- We have got to get
the letter "M" back.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.767
- Yeah!
- And here it is!

07:41.767 --> 07:44.133
This time I have
the letter "M"
for sure-sies.

07:44.133 --> 07:45.734
- Wha...
- See?

07:45.734 --> 07:48.533
The lines go down,
up, down, up.

07:48.533 --> 07:51.734
But the lines on an "M"
go up, down, up, down.

07:51.734 --> 07:53.467
Yeah.
That's the letter "W."

07:53.467 --> 07:56.667
Oh, come on. You have
got to be kidding me!

07:56.667 --> 07:58.734
I don't suppose we could just
use this instead of the "M."

07:58.734 --> 08:00.500
- Nina: No. Mm-mmm. No.
- Grover: No, I didn't think so.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.467
'Cause the "W" makes
a "wuh" sound.

08:02.467 --> 08:05.567
- Uh-huh.
- So instead of saying "moo,"
these cows would say...

08:05.567 --> 08:07.367
Cows: Woo!

08:07.367 --> 08:10.066
Oh, come on, now,
you crazy cows.

08:10.066 --> 08:12.166
Wait a minute.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.233
Something doesn't
look right here.

08:14.233 --> 08:15.633
( humming )

08:15.633 --> 08:17.700
Are you really
the letter "W"?

08:17.700 --> 08:21.767
Um, yeah, why, uh, uh,
why do you ask?

08:21.767 --> 08:25.333
Well, because your face
is upside down.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.400
Ha ha!
Hey, wait a minute.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.600
- Elmo thinks you're really...
- Wha-wha-what?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.700
The letter "M"!

08:31.700 --> 08:33.233
- ( Nina gasps )
- ( Elmo chuckles )

08:33.233 --> 08:35.567
All right.
It's true!

08:35.567 --> 08:37.700
I am the letter "M."

08:37.700 --> 08:40.066
Ahh, yes,
I knew it all along.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.867
We've been looking
for you.

08:41.867 --> 08:43.066
Yeah!

08:43.066 --> 08:44.934
Why were you pretending
to be a "W"?

08:44.934 --> 08:46.467
Why?

08:46.467 --> 08:50.100
Oh, because the letter "W"
is an exciting letter to be.

08:50.100 --> 08:56.100
Oh, it starts great words like
"wow" and "wee" and-- and...

08:56.100 --> 08:57.834
Cows: Woo!

08:57.834 --> 08:59.734
Yes, "woo."
thank you.

08:59.734 --> 09:03.166
But "M" starts some great words,
like "marvelous."

09:03.166 --> 09:06.300
- And "magical."
- And "music."

09:06.300 --> 09:08.333
And that thing that,
uh, cows say,

09:08.333 --> 09:10.600
which I cannot remember
right now.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.100
Moo.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.300

Wai-ait for it!

20:49.367 --> 20:50.834

All the letters
of the alphabet!

20:53.600 --> 20:57.500
Oh, from "A" to "Z"!

20:57.500 --> 21:00.166
Boy, Elmo loves
the alphabet

21:00.166 --> 21:02.567
and wants to find out
more about it.

21:02.567 --> 21:06.166
Hey, hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.333
Let's call her together.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.066
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:11.066 --> 21:13.233
( chime plays
"Elmo's Song" )

21:13.233 --> 21:14.533
Hiya, Elmo!

21:14.533 --> 21:18.100
Check this out!
It's my favorite. Alphabet soup.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.467
Oh, ho ho! Yeah!

21:19.467 --> 21:21.433
Oh, that's perfect,
Smartie,

21:21.433 --> 21:25.333
because Elmo wants to learn
all about the alphabet today.

21:25.333 --> 21:28.133
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:28.133 --> 21:31.367
All:
We look it up!

21:31.367 --> 21:34.000
Getting the "A" to "Z"
on the alphabet.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.200
Here we go.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.033
You can find letters
of the alphabet all around us.

21:40.033 --> 21:43.967
They're on street signs
and even doors and windows.

21:43.967 --> 21:46.800
There are uppercase letters,
which are letters that are big,

21:46.800 --> 21:48.367
and there are
lowercase letters,

21:48.367 --> 21:50.667
which are letters
that are small.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.633
Some letters
have straight lines,

21:52.633 --> 21:54.333
like the letter "T."

21:54.333 --> 21:56.800
Other letters have fun,
curvy lines,

21:56.800 --> 21:59.100
like the letter "S."

21:59.100 --> 22:01.433
When you put letters together,
you can sound them out

22:01.433 --> 22:04.166
and make all sorts
of wonderful words.

22:04.166 --> 22:07.567
C-A-T.

22:07.567 --> 22:08.967
Smartie:
That spells "cat."

22:10.400 --> 22:11.834
Wow!

22:11.834 --> 22:15.767
Elmo loves seeing the letters
of the alphabet make words.

22:15.767 --> 22:19.000
Yeah,
it's pretty a-mazing!

22:19.000 --> 22:21.667
Well, I got a word search
waiting for me.

22:21.667 --> 22:23.800
I'll "Z" you later.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.433
Oh! "Z" you later.

22:25.433 --> 22:28.433
Thank you, Smartie.
Hee hee!

22:28.433 --> 22:32.200
Hey, hey! That gives Elmo
an idea.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.667
Oh, ho! Let's play a game
together. Yeah!

22:35.667 --> 22:37.166
Come on. Come on.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.033
Ha ha ha!

22:40.967 --> 22:42.867
Hee hee!

22:44.567 --> 22:48.433
Let's see how many letters
we can find in this picture.

22:48.433 --> 22:51.333
Are you ready?
Let's play!

22:51.333 --> 22:53.700
Boy, Elmo doesn't see
any letters.

22:53.700 --> 22:57.400
- Child: There's a "B"!
- Elmo: A "B"? Where?

22:57.400 --> 23:00.900
- Child #2: The bench.
- Elmo: Oh, ho! The bench.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.367
Elmo sees it.

23:02.367 --> 23:06.333
"B" is for bench.
What other letters can we find?

23:06.333 --> 23:09.100
Child:
An "S." It's in the sun.

23:09.100 --> 23:13.133
Elmo:
Oh, ho! There it is.
"S" is for sun.

23:13.133 --> 23:15.133
Are there any more letters?

23:15.133 --> 23:16.667
- Child #2: "Z"!
- Elmo: "Z"?

23:16.667 --> 23:18.166
Where's the letter "Z"?

23:18.166 --> 23:21.800
- Child: On the zebra.
- Elmo: On the zebra...

23:21.800 --> 23:25.166
Oh, ho ho ho! Found you,
letter "Z."

23:25.166 --> 23:27.500
And "Z" is for zebra.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.667
We did it! We found
all the letters.

23:30.667 --> 23:33.300
Good job, everybody.

23:33.300 --> 23:37.700
Wow!
The alphabet is everywhere.

23:37.700 --> 23:41.433
Ooh, and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:41.433 --> 23:44.433
Oh, does Mr. Noodle
know the alphabet?

23:44.433 --> 23:46.066

24:09.567 --> 24:11.967
Kid:
That's not the first letter
of the alphabet.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.266
That's a ball.

24:13.266 --> 24:14.734
Elmo:
Schmoodle!

24:14.734 --> 24:16.767
A ball isn't a letter
of the alphabet.

24:16.767 --> 24:19.900
"A" is the first letter
of the alphabet.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.500
Can you find the letter "A,"
Schmoodle?

24:22.500 --> 24:25.533
Child:
That's not the first letter
of the alphabet.

24:25.533 --> 24:27.000
Child #2:
That's a bone.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.333

wants to play!

Keep trying, Schmoodle.

24:32.033 --> 24:34.533

That's it! The letter "A"
is the first letter

of the alphabet.

Kids:
You did it, Schmoodle!

24:37.934 --> 24:39.800
Elmo:
Maybe next time,
you can find more letters

24:39.800 --> 24:41.600
to make words.
