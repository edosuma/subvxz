<i>As I write these very words,</i>

01:15.418 --> 01:19.175
<i>the witch, Margaret Morgan,</i>

01:19.293 --> 01:22.339
<i>gathers with her coven of six</i>

01:22.501 --> 01:25.926
<i>deep within the woods
surrounding our beloved Salem.</i>

01:27.501 --> 01:31.554
<i>The blasphemous music echoes in my mind</i>

01:31.667 --> 01:34.299
<i>driving me to the point of insanity.</i>

01:36.001 --> 01:40.007
<i>I, Jonathan Hawthorne,</i>

01:40.168 --> 01:46.793
<i>swear before the eyes of God
on this day in the year of our Lord 1696,</i>

01:47.667 --> 01:54.341
<i>to destroy all persons which choose
to pledge allegiance to the demon Satan</i>

01:54.501 --> 01:56.504
<i>and his spectral army.</i>

01:58.709 --> 02:03.842
In the name of Satan...

02:05.417 --> 02:09.008
ruler of the earth...

02:10.667 --> 02:15.882
the king of the world...

02:17.210 --> 02:23.550
open wide the gates of hell
and come forth...

02:24.501 --> 02:27.511
from your blessed abyss.

02:27.667 --> 02:34.387
All hail, Unholy Father,
make your presence known this night.

02:34.501 --> 02:38.507
I swear on this day to be a faithful
servant to the Prince Lucifer.

02:38.626 --> 02:43.627
- Make your presence known this night...
- I swear mind, body and soul

02:43.751 --> 02:46.334
to the designs of his Lord Satan.

02:46.459 --> 02:49.007
We trample on the cross!

02:49.168 --> 02:52.510
We spit upon the book of lies.

02:52.667 --> 02:55.512
- Make your presence known...
- I'm ready. I'm ready.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.134
To abandon this mortal existence

02:58.251 --> 03:02.672
and deny Jesus Christ,
the deceiver of mankind!

03:02.834 --> 03:09.803
Sisters, stand ready to desecrate
these false bodies.

03:10.501 --> 03:13.712
Show yourselves.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.296
All together!

03:33.417 --> 03:39.178
We desecrate the virgin whore!

03:39.292 --> 03:43.963
Blaspheme the holy spirit!

03:44.085 --> 03:48.635
Laugh at his suffering!

05:20.918 --> 05:23.845
<i>She got down but she never got tired</i>

05:23.960 --> 05:26.543
<i>She's gonna make it through the night...</i>

05:31.001 --> 05:34.177
<i>I Through the night</i>

06:12.543 --> 06:14.628
Hi, big bubba.

06:14.751 --> 06:17.003
I love you.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.170
Good boy. OK, go on.

06:29.793 --> 06:31.796
Jesus.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.674
Would putting it on the mat kill you?

06:59.793 --> 07:02.637
Hi. Are you the new tenant?

07:04.376 --> 07:06.177
I live here at number two.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.170
All right.

07:18.001 --> 07:20.335
<i>In other news,
state legislators gathered today</i>

07:20.501 --> 07:23.962
<i>to discuss changes
to passage lanes on the Mass Turnpike.</i>

07:24.084 --> 07:26.134
<i>Construction could begin
as early as March 1st</i>

07:26.251 --> 07:29.213
<i>labor unions agree
on the official stan' date.</i>

07:29.334 --> 07:31.669
<i>City officials are in agreement
on the proposed toll hike</i>

07:31.793 --> 07:34.471
<i>from $5. 10 to $7.</i>

07:34.584 --> 07:36.801
<i>The president of the
motor transport association...</i>

07:36.918 --> 07:38.921
Get off the table. No, no, no.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.045
Get down. No, no.

07:59.418 --> 08:02.001
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Lace.

08:02.167 --> 08:06.008
- How are you this morning?
- Moving a little slow.

08:06.126 --> 08:09.551
I see you finally rented
the dreaded number five.

08:09.668 --> 08:11.552
I wish, babe, I wish.

08:11.668 --> 08:14.879
That apartment is a total dog.
No offense, Troy.

08:15.001 --> 08:18.177
No one wants it.
I don't get it. I know the price is right.

08:18.334 --> 08:21.594
But I just saw the tenant like ten minutes
ago standing in the doorway.

08:22.626 --> 08:26.335
I hate to break it to you,
but there is no person in number five.

08:26.459 --> 08:29.174
I definitely saw someone standing there.

08:29.292 --> 08:32.255
I said hi
and they slammed the door in my face.

08:32.376 --> 08:35.256
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

08:35.376 --> 08:38.006
But I'll check it out
if it makes you feel better.

08:38.167 --> 08:40.669
- Yeah, it would.
- Hello.

08:40.835 --> 08:44.711
You handsome boy.
Did you have a good night's sleep?

08:46.501 --> 08:49.346
Well, I better get this beautiful boy
out for a walk.

08:49.501 --> 08:51.338
I'll see you later.

08:51.501 --> 08:53.753
- Come on, Troy.
- Have a good one.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.127
<i>The Big H Team!</i>

09:48.251 --> 09:49.757

10:05.209 --> 10:08.670
<i>WIQZ. Salem Rocks.</i>

10:33.126 --> 10:35.045
You know,
I think I'm starting to like it.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.751
My mother lost her virginity
to that song, I believe.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.233
- Don't talk about your mom that way.
<i>- This is your mother!</i>

10:40.334 --> 10:42.135
We are here with Count Gorgann

10:42.251 --> 10:44.550
from the band
Leviathan the Fleeing Serpent.

10:44.668 --> 10:48.128
- Count? Royalty. Royalty in the house.
- Count. He is a count.

10:48.251 --> 10:51.842
Count, how come you look at me
like a beautiful FrÃ¤ulein?

10:52.001 --> 10:53.174
<i>Ja, that is a my schnitzel.</i>

10:53.293 --> 10:56.386
Can you explain the philosophy
behind your music?

10:56.501 --> 11:01.502
Our philosophy is to expose
the lies of the Christian whores

11:01.626 --> 11:03.842
and Jesus the true bringer of death.

11:06.668 --> 11:10.591
<i>We are not the crying sheep of God.</i>

11:10.710 --> 11:13.506
We are the mighty goat.

11:13.626 --> 11:17.335
Why the goat? Why not the pig?

11:17.501 --> 11:20.879
According to Mr Chung's menu,
I was born in the year of the pig.

11:21.001 --> 11:23.086
<i>Good for me.</i>

11:24.668 --> 11:27.002
The goat has free will

11:27.126 --> 11:31.214
and for that reason he will always be
punished by the oppressor God.

11:31.334 --> 11:32.425
<i>Praise Jesus!</i>

11:32.543 --> 11:37.592
God must die. God is the unholy pig.

11:37.710 --> 11:41.668
- We serve the butcher.
- OK.

11:47.501 --> 11:50.512
<i>Hey, girl!
Give it to me, what you say?</i>

11:50.668 --> 11:52.552
So, a Mexican dwarf?

11:52.668 --> 11:54.636
<i>Si Carlo.</i>

11:54.751 --> 11:56.671
I used to know a dwarf named Dero.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.720
<i>I What you say?
Give it to me, what you say?</i>

11:59.834 --> 12:01.636
<i>Give it to me</i>

12:01.751 --> 12:03.221
<i>Give it to me</i>

12:03.334 --> 12:06.179
- OK, are we done yet?
- I know I am.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.011
Good God, let's get the F out of here.

12:08.168 --> 12:12.126
It's Monday, so you know what that means.
Ladies' choice.

12:12.251 --> 12:13.673
In other words...

12:13.834 --> 12:15.719
Rush.

12:20.293 --> 12:22.840
Let's have a drink.
All right, pour it on me.

12:35.334 --> 12:37.338
<i>Andale! Andale!</i>

12:40.501 --> 12:42.835
Hey, mama.

12:43.001 --> 12:45.004
This came for you.

12:45.585 --> 12:48.962
Very fancy.

12:49.084 --> 12:51.218
Who's that from, pray tell?

12:51.334 --> 12:54.794
I don't know.
Some band called the Lords, I guess.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.335
- Sure as shit.
- What?

12:57.501 --> 12:59.587
It's shit.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.713
OK, Mr Negative, just for that,

13:01.834 --> 13:03.884
I'm gonna take it home
and give it a listen.

13:09.626 --> 13:11.012
- Have a good one!
- Bye, baby.

13:11.168 --> 13:13.798
<i>- Salaam Alaikum.
- Salaikum salaam.</i>

13:16.168 --> 13:17.922
Anyone want a lift?

13:18.042 --> 13:20.923
My head is spinning from the tequila.

13:21.042 --> 13:23.295
If I get in a car, I think I might puke.

13:23.418 --> 13:26.594
Enjoy the walk.
It's good for the lungs, I hear.

13:28.917 --> 13:31.844
- So I hear.
- Hop up on the handle bars.

13:32.585 --> 13:35.795
- You wish.
- Don't doubt me.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.596
All right, kids,
I gotta get home to the warden

13:38.709 --> 13:42.715
without racking up another DWS,
if you know what I mean.

13:42.834 --> 13:46.627
- You mean DWI.
- No. DWS.

13:46.751 --> 13:48.718
Driving while sexy.

13:48.834 --> 13:50.636
Driving while stupid.

13:50.751 --> 13:53.334
<i>Bonne chance!</i>

14:27.751 --> 14:30.466
Never fear, maestro's here.

14:47.335 --> 14:49.716
<i>I Shiny, shiny</i>

14:49.834 --> 14:51.718
<i>- I Shiny boots of leather...
- What?</i>

14:51.834 --> 14:54.003
Nothing.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.927
Too obvious?

14:59.751 --> 15:01.552
What the fuck does that mean?

15:33.543 --> 15:36.008
We gotta convince Herman
to drop the rug routine.

15:36.126 --> 15:37.927
You think?

15:38.043 --> 15:42.712
Who does he think he's fooling
with that dead possum on his head?

15:42.834 --> 15:47.006
He'd be much better off
rocking the Isaac Hayes.

15:48.293 --> 15:50.793
You gotta tell him. He'll listen to you.

15:50.918 --> 15:55.006
Me? I told him
he'd look cooler without it.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.968
He won't listen to anybody.

16:02.335 --> 16:03.626
Dead air.

16:03.751 --> 16:06.217
Yeah. Dead hair.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.842
Dead air.

16:16.084 --> 16:17.294
Well, how about this?

16:20.335 --> 16:25.584
In Ukraine,
music always delivered in wooden box.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.837
Sure, whatever.

16:30.084 --> 16:33.509
Thick vinyl. Strong like bear.

16:40.293 --> 16:43.587
Sorry.
I think I owe you a new needle.

16:44.626 --> 16:46.048
- Well...
- Let me try this again.

16:46.168 --> 16:47.886
Damn.

16:48.001 --> 16:50.004
What are you doing?

17:04.001 --> 17:06.003
It's really fucked-up sounding.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.758
We should smash or trash this tomorrow.

17:14.126 --> 17:18.049
Hey, you all right? Are you cool?

17:22.876 --> 17:29.845
<i>Breed this new world
with the blessed spawn of your glory.</i>

18:25.834 --> 18:29.627
Your vile taste sickens me.

18:33.043 --> 18:37.712
Remove this hideous creature.

18:39.335 --> 18:42.961
Sisters, we have failed.

18:53.793 --> 18:56.294
Hey, you OK?

18:56.417 --> 18:58.137
Are you cool?

18:58.251 --> 19:00.254
I suddenly got super tired.

19:04.375 --> 19:08.169
Oh, well, yeah, no, I mean, I'll go.
I got a long ride home.

19:08.335 --> 19:11.510
You can crash on the couch if you want.

19:11.626 --> 19:13.878
Really? The couch?

19:14.001 --> 19:16.004
Yeah, really, the couch.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.467
<i>Even though I had a mum
who was a drug addict,</i>

20:12.584 --> 20:15.595
<i>it still felt so really attractive
for some reason,</i>

20:15.709 --> 20:18.175
<i>even after years
of watching her go downhill.</i>

20:18.334 --> 20:22.340
<i>I just knew that somewhere along the line,
I was gonna have to try it for myself</i>

20:22.459 --> 20:25.837
<i>I wasn't the kind of guy who would really
learn from other peoples mistakes.</i>

20:26.001 --> 20:27.839
<i>That was just not the
way I did it, you know.</i>

20:28.001 --> 20:31.877
If I did it, I was gonna do it and I was
gonna learn the lesson the hard way,

20:32.001 --> 20:34.335
which I did, repeatedly.

20:34.459 --> 20:38.087
So here I am, not wanting to learn
from other people's mistakes

20:38.210 --> 20:41.504
and I'm trying to help you guys
learn from my mistakes,

20:41.668 --> 20:43.468
even though I still struggle every day

20:43.584 --> 20:47.507
with everything that I've ever learned
over the last 12 years.

20:52.168 --> 20:56.126
- Thank you. That was great.
- Thank you. Thank you for coming.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.756
I'm off dairy.

20:57.876 --> 21:00.839
Attention all cows on the eastern seaboard.
Herman is off dairy.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.511
Wait a minute. You're off dairy?

21:02.668 --> 21:04.220
And gluten free.

21:04.334 --> 21:07.049
- Do you even know what gluten free is?
- Of course.

21:07.168 --> 21:09.419
I just saw you eat a grilled cheese
five minutes ago.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.261
<i>- I like cheese!
- Sandwiches don't count.</i>

21:11.376 --> 21:14.338
Bread and cheese.

21:15.918 --> 21:19.675
Anyway, if you're just tuning in,
we've been chatting with Francis Matthais,

21:19.793 --> 21:23.585
<i>author of the book Satan's Last Stand.
The Truth about the Salem Witch Trials.</i>

21:23.709 --> 21:25.843
You look very handsome
on the back cover here.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.345
Thank you.

21:27.501 --> 21:30.712
Is that why you took the book
into the bathroom, Heidi?

21:30.834 --> 21:32.505
You are such a perv.

21:32.668 --> 21:34.718
That's a very intriguing tattoo.

21:34.834 --> 21:37.964
- Oh, thank you.
- It's really kind of mesmerizing.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.879
Francis. Restrain.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.135
<i>OMG, stop looking at my titties!</i>

21:44.251 --> 21:48.469
I have a wife. Alice, if you're listening,
please do not change the locks.

21:48.584 --> 21:50.634
It doesn't stop Heidi, don't worry.

21:52.751 --> 21:55.216
All right, so, Francis,

21:55.334 --> 21:58.759
how many people were actually executed

21:58.876 --> 22:00.844
during the Salem witch trials?

22:00.960 --> 22:03.637
Well, approximately 25,

22:03.751 --> 22:08.171
if you include the accused witches
that died in prison.

22:08.334 --> 22:10.384
Come on, 25? Are you serious?

22:10.501 --> 22:13.345
I mean, I have to admit
I'm a bit disappointed with the number.

22:13.459 --> 22:16.173
Were there any quote, unquote,
"real witches" in Salem?

22:16.334 --> 22:20.340
Well, today there's a large
Wiccan population.

22:20.501 --> 22:23.215
They're a positive earth-centered religion.

22:23.334 --> 22:26.510
Yeah, hairy armpits and granola.
I don't dig it.

22:26.626 --> 22:28.510
I shave my armpits.

22:28.668 --> 22:30.505
That's a pity.

22:30.626 --> 22:33.209
<i>You know, classic witches.</i>

22:33.334 --> 22:36.380
No, there are no classic witches, actually.

22:36.501 --> 22:39.511
Witchcraft is nothing but
a psychotic belief

22:39.668 --> 22:43.923
brought upon
by a delusional state of mind.

22:47.668 --> 22:50.844
Windy, I can't make an exception.
The oven's already off.

22:51.001 --> 22:54.461
Look, I got a couple calzones left.
I can drop 'em off on my way home.

22:54.584 --> 22:56.634
How's that?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.754
Bye-bye.

23:05.376 --> 23:08.008
<i>- Violence on Monday...
- ...appears...</i>

23:08.167 --> 23:11.510
<i>The book is called Satan's Last Stand:
The Truth about the Salem Witch Trials.</i>

23:11.626 --> 23:12.717
So, check it out.

23:12.835 --> 23:14.754
Hey, everybody.
What do you think it's time for?

23:14.876 --> 23:16.547
<i>Smash or Trash.</i>

23:16.668 --> 23:20.341
I believe Heidi is gonna provide us
with our first victim.

23:20.459 --> 23:21.502
That's right.

23:21.668 --> 23:24.866
This one is a little different from most.
I have no info on where this came from.

23:24.876 --> 23:27.839
All I know is the group
is called the Lords.

23:28.001 --> 23:31.960
I assume they're from around here,
so we'll just call them the Lords of Salem.

23:33.835 --> 23:36.512
<i>Francis, we'd like to thank you
for coming in.</i>

23:36.626 --> 23:39.387
<i>- You've been a great guest.
- Well, thank you for having me.</i>

23:39.501 --> 23:44.087
<i>Alright, open up the phone lines
and lets hear what everyone has to say.</i>

23:44.209 --> 23:49.756
<i>Phones are now open,
so get ready to smash or trash.</i>

24:23.459 --> 24:25.462
Can you mute that?
It's giving me a headache.

24:27.001 --> 24:28.009
Thanks.

24:48.459 --> 24:52.004
May I ask you,
where did you get that music from?

24:52.126 --> 24:55.006
According to our receptionist,
it just appeared,

24:55.126 --> 24:57.176
with nothing but a note for me.

24:57.334 --> 25:00.380
It specifically came just to you?

25:00.501 --> 25:02.967
Yeah, very specifically.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.882
I didn't think anyone knew my real name.
Fucking Internet.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.344
Yeah. Well, I'm just gonna
mosey on home now,

25:09.501 --> 25:11.586
get the critique from the wife, so...

25:11.710 --> 25:13.962
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

25:14.084 --> 25:15.091
Bye-bye.

25:17.042 --> 25:19.010
<i>- I'm home!
- Hola.</i>

25:19.126 --> 25:21.129
I hate this broken door.

25:23.042 --> 25:25.295
So, did you listen? How was it?

25:25.418 --> 25:29.839
Did I listen? Did I listen?
Of course I listened.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.802
- You were fantastic.
- Yeah?

25:31.918 --> 25:34.963
And I recorded you
so you could hear yourself back.

25:35.084 --> 25:37.502
Oh, no, I hate the sound of my voice.

25:37.626 --> 25:40.257
Imagine me.
I have to listen to it every day.

25:42.084 --> 25:45.842
So did you...
Did you record the music that they played?

25:45.959 --> 25:48.377
Yeah.

25:48.501 --> 25:52.554
You know, I can't believe the noise
that masquerades as music today.

25:52.668 --> 25:55.002
- You know?
- I know.

25:56.001 --> 25:59.296
You know, I'm hungry.
I'm hungry. Are you?

25:59.418 --> 26:03.175
I'm going to reheat
some of the leftover pasta.

26:03.334 --> 26:07.506
I wanna... listen to that music again.

26:08.793 --> 26:11.009
Something about it really upsets me.

26:11.167 --> 26:12.839
Just...

26:13.835 --> 26:17.343
Especially the name, Lords of Salem.

26:20.293 --> 26:22.296
Where have I heard that?

26:27.084 --> 26:30.178
You really think that Francis guy's cute?

26:30.334 --> 26:31.922
Are you serious?

26:32.042 --> 26:34.045
I mean, come on. Francis?

26:34.167 --> 26:36.799
What kind of name is that?

26:36.917 --> 26:38.920
Don't be jelly.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.134
I'll see you kids tomorrow.

26:45.251 --> 26:49.304
And you, you get some sleep, would you?

26:49.418 --> 26:51.088
You look exhausted.

26:51.209 --> 26:54.136
Thanks. You make me feel so pretty.

26:54.251 --> 26:56.835
You know what I mean, string bean.
Good night.

26:56.959 --> 26:59.507
- See you.
- See you later.

27:01.793 --> 27:04.471
<i>Combien est-ce que je vous dais?</i>

27:08.001 --> 27:10.217
<i>Combien est-ce que je vous dais?</i>

27:12.710 --> 27:15.175
<i>Pouvez-vous parler plus lentement?</i>

27:17.001 --> 27:19.217
<i>Pouvez-vous parler plus lentement?</i>

27:39.167 --> 27:41.336
- Heidi.
- Hi.

27:41.459 --> 27:44.884
- Come in. Come and meet my sisters.
- I have to...

27:45.001 --> 27:46.637
OK.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.838
Hi. Nice to meet you.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.721
Oh, please come on in
and join the party.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.513
Hey, she broke out the good stuff
for a change.

27:55.626 --> 28:00.177
If you consider Merlot from Australia
the good stuff, mate!

28:01.917 --> 28:03.470
Come on. Come and join us.

28:03.585 --> 28:06.002
OK, but first I gotta go up and feed Troy.

28:06.167 --> 28:07.341
- OK.
- OK.

28:07.459 --> 28:09.344
Oh, awesome! We'll wait.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.171
We'll be waiting.

28:42.792 --> 28:44.795
Troy. Come here, Troy.

28:48.917 --> 28:51.963
I know, buddy, I'm late. I'm sorry.

28:52.084 --> 28:54.383
I'm sorry. OK, hold on one second.

28:57.543 --> 28:59.877
Here we go. Come here. That's it.

29:00.751 --> 29:02.836
There you go.

29:02.959 --> 29:04.843
OK, I promise I'll be back quick.

29:04.959 --> 29:09.345
I'm just gonna go have a quick one
with the ladies downstairs. Be back soon.

29:17.959 --> 29:22.380
That should do it.
Another dead soldier.

29:23.168 --> 29:25.052
You served your country well, sir.

29:25.168 --> 29:27.052
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear. Cheers.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.213
So what do you gals do?

29:34.334 --> 29:36.587
I'm a self-help guru.

29:36.710 --> 29:39.672
I help people who are lost,
find themselves again.

29:39.792 --> 29:42.803
I think I could use some of that.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.086
We all could, baby.

29:45.209 --> 29:47.971
- And Megan here...
- I read, darling.

29:48.876 --> 29:52.834
Read? I'm not sure I understand.
Like a proofreader?

29:53.001 --> 29:55.881
Megan is a very good palm reader.

29:57.293 --> 30:02.176
See, most readings
are like surface observations,

30:02.293 --> 30:07.425
but Megan sees things really deeply,
into the world beyond.

30:09.168 --> 30:11.798
Really? I've never had my palm read before.

30:11.917 --> 30:14.501
I always thought it was kind of a scam.
No offense.

30:14.626 --> 30:19.212
Oh, well, actually, my dear,
I do take offense, great offense.

30:19.334 --> 30:24.218
Plastic Gypsies with crystal balls
and neon signs

30:24.334 --> 30:27.012
have destroyed the value of my gift.

30:27.168 --> 30:29.964
Give her your hand.

30:31.751 --> 30:33.801
The hand and the brain are one.

30:33.917 --> 30:37.793
One quarter of the motor cortex
in the human brain

30:37.917 --> 30:40.549
is devoted to the hand.

30:40.667 --> 30:43.631
- Did you know that?
- No.

30:43.751 --> 30:49.179
The lines are formed
at a subatomic and cellular level.

30:49.293 --> 30:52.220
These are the lines of your life.

30:52.334 --> 30:54.752
Let me see your right hand.

30:56.626 --> 31:00.051
The right hand is the future.

31:00.168 --> 31:02.253
Ls that the life line?

31:02.376 --> 31:05.884
This is the line of fate.

31:06.001 --> 31:08.845
This is the only line of concern to me.

31:08.959 --> 31:12.005
The length of your life
is inconsequential.

31:12.126 --> 31:15.918
It's what you do with your time
that matters.

31:17.792 --> 31:22.344
OK, well...
So, tell me, what is my destiny?

31:22.501 --> 31:25.346
It reads your fate, not your destiny.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.011
Is there a difference?

31:27.126 --> 31:30.918
With destiny
you can premeditate the outcome,

31:31.043 --> 31:36.471
but fate, fate leaves you no choice.

31:37.460 --> 31:42.378
It is predetermined
by forces stronger than ourselves.

31:42.501 --> 31:46.128
I don't like that. I think
I changed my mind. I don't wanna know.

31:46.251 --> 31:50.209
You must make peace
with your subconscious desires.

31:51.251 --> 31:53.503
Really? What desires?

31:53.626 --> 31:57.170
The wicked thoughts
burning inside your head

31:57.293 --> 32:00.339
and exploding
in the juices between your legs.

32:00.501 --> 32:03.677
The darkness within your very soul.

32:03.834 --> 32:07.094
The only reason you exist.

32:08.460 --> 32:12.466
I think I'll make peace
with those desires later.

32:12.584 --> 32:14.552
I really should be getting upstairs now.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.962
Heidi, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

32:18.084 --> 32:21.510
Megan can be a little adamant,
you know, sometimes about these things.

32:21.626 --> 32:23.794
Yeah, and a little wasted.

32:23.917 --> 32:27.591
I'm really embarrassed.
This is not the evening I had planned.

32:27.709 --> 32:30.471
No, it's fine. Have a good night.

32:31.209 --> 32:33.213
- Good night.
- Good night.

32:37.501 --> 32:41.175
- Well, have another drink.
- I think that went rather well.

32:41.335 --> 32:45.388
Why do you have to get so intense
when you do these readings?

32:45.501 --> 32:47.505
It's really annoying.

33:07.001 --> 33:09.679
<i>No change, Pete? Still jumpy.</i>

33:11.834 --> 33:14.086
<i>That was a sucker move,
burning down your boss.</i>

33:15.251 --> 33:17.219
<i>You had him all wrong.</i>

33:17.335 --> 33:19.254
<i>He never crossed you.</i>

33:19.376 --> 33:22.836
<i>But you're a guy who speaks first
and thinks afterwards.</i>

33:22.959 --> 33:26.219
<i>In your spot,
I'll almost choose the cops,</i>

33:26.335 --> 33:28.835
<i>even if it is a first-degree murder rap.</i>

33:29.335 --> 33:31.172
<i>It's lucky I spotted you.</i>

33:31.335 --> 33:33.338
<i>What is so lucky about being dead?</i>

33:33.460 --> 33:38.129
<i>I'm gonna take care of a guy
just a little too smart. Take off the mask.</i>

33:58.584 --> 34:00.006
Oh, man, what the hell?

34:02.501 --> 34:04.967
Troy. Troy.

34:06.626 --> 34:10.300
Get over here. Get over here.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.168
What are you doing?
You're scratching up the door.

34:15.293 --> 34:17.876
Come on.
You're scratching up the door. Come on.

34:18.001 --> 34:20.547
Come on, Troy. Come on.

34:20.667 --> 34:23.299
Come on, let's go back.
Come on. How'd you get out?

34:29.001 --> 34:30.210
Here we go.

37:38.001 --> 37:40.004
<i>Sister.</i>

37:42.542 --> 37:44.546
<i>Feel the earth.</i>

37:46.709 --> 37:48.712
<i>Taste...</i>

37:50.126 --> 37:52.804
<i>of the air</i>

37:55.459 --> 37:57.462
<i>Do you hear...</i>

37:59.501 --> 38:01.835
<i>the sound of the clouds...</i>

38:04.210 --> 38:08.002
<i>and the scent of the wind...</i>

38:10.501 --> 38:13.180
<i>all becoming one?</i>

38:16.501 --> 38:21.005
<i>The whores of the deceivers</i>

38:21.168 --> 38:24.795
<i>are gathering round us.</i>

38:29.501 --> 38:31.634
You...

38:32.834 --> 38:34.838
are the blade

38:35.001 --> 38:39.008
by which will bleed...

38:41.417 --> 38:46.799
the cunting daughters of Salem.

38:50.501 --> 38:52.504
Dear Heidi.

38:54.543 --> 38:56.048
Bleed us a king.

38:59.834 --> 39:02.797
Bleed us...

39:05.501 --> 39:07.504
a king.

39:09.709 --> 39:11.712
Bleed us a king.

39:12.292 --> 39:14.342
Bleed us a king.

39:39.459 --> 39:41.961
Bleed us a king!

39:48.167 --> 39:50.170
It's OK.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.004
Hi.

42:07.376 --> 42:08.882
Why are you in here?

42:09.000 --> 42:11.004
I don't know.

42:12.626 --> 42:14.297
I was walking by with my dog

42:14.418 --> 42:17.796
and I thought I would just come in
and sit for a minute.

42:17.918 --> 42:20.383
Is that OK? Are you closed?

42:22.001 --> 42:24.004
No.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.129
We never close.

42:27.251 --> 42:30.925
God is always open and ready to listen.

42:38.668 --> 42:40.671
I just needed to sit and think.

42:41.668 --> 42:43.671
Yes.

42:44.835 --> 42:49.753
It is a nice place to just... come and sit.

42:50.459 --> 42:52.676
Yeah, it's nice.

43:05.501 --> 43:07.338
You're a very sad girl.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.462
Yeah.

43:19.835 --> 43:21.174
I think I should get going.

43:21.334 --> 43:23.337
What the fuck?

43:25.001 --> 43:28.344
You have to understand

43:28.459 --> 43:33.592
that there is a war waging in heaven.

43:33.710 --> 43:37.052
Michael and his angels fought
against the dragon and his serpents,

43:37.167 --> 43:41.802
but God does not spare angels
when they sin

43:41.917 --> 43:44.880
but sends them to hell.

43:45.001 --> 43:51.591
You are a filthy whore of Satan.

43:51.710 --> 43:57.137
Christ can't save you.
Only I can save you.

43:59.751 --> 44:05.179
You must no longer offer
worship and sacrifice

44:05.334 --> 44:08.511
to the goat idols
to whom you prostitute yourself.

44:11.668 --> 44:17.511
You must understand
what the Lord has done for you

44:17.626 --> 44:23.303
and how he has supreme mercy
on your soul!

44:29.459 --> 44:31.048
Miss?

44:31.167 --> 44:34.759
I believe you fell asleep.
It's very peaceful in here.

45:03.501 --> 45:05.385
<i>We've been waiting for you, Heidi</i>

45:35.501 --> 45:41.676
<i>Be it this day of 27 September,
1696, Margaret Morgan...</i>

45:41.792 --> 45:43.795
No!

45:45.293 --> 45:49.714
You stand guilty
to the crimes of witchcraft

45:49.834 --> 45:52.680
and accepting the devil.

47:20.626 --> 47:23.044
Morgan!

48:18.959 --> 48:21.839
Alice!

48:21.959 --> 48:25.385
- Yeah, can you do something for me?
- I'm busy.

48:25.501 --> 48:27.551
Yeah, can you play some music for me?

48:27.667 --> 48:30.465
- I'm in the tub.
- Here, look at this. Look at this.

48:30.585 --> 48:32.006
Look.

48:32.126 --> 48:34.840
- Can this wait like five minutes?
- No, no.

48:35.001 --> 48:39.670
Now, this... this book reprints
the last remaining five pages

48:39.834 --> 48:43.046
of Jonathan Hawthorne's diary.

48:43.168 --> 48:49.010
The witches, he refers to them
as the Lords of Salem.

48:49.168 --> 48:53.007
Now, Heidi says
that the music that she received

48:53.126 --> 48:56.338
came to her directly from the Lords.

49:16.293 --> 49:18.296
That the same?

49:19.209 --> 49:20.217
I think so.

49:24.709 --> 49:26.842
Yeah. Exactly the same.

49:32.001 --> 49:34.502
Isn't that odd?

49:34.667 --> 49:36.054
No, not really.

49:36.168 --> 49:39.711
I mean, you know, someone else
might have the same book

49:39.834 --> 49:44.586
and copied the name and the music,
the melody and, you know...

49:44.709 --> 49:47.127
Nothing out of this world, really.
No big deal.

49:47.251 --> 49:48.886
Play it again.

50:00.500 --> 50:03.844
<i>I walk in
on butt-naked toothless granny</i>

50:04.001 --> 50:06.336
<i>tooting Grandpa's clarinet
like Mrs Benny Goodman.</i>

50:06.460 --> 50:09.884
Sounds like your grandmother
has an appetite for the hot sauce.

50:10.001 --> 50:12.679
She must have been
one spicy tamale.

50:12.792 --> 50:15.211
Are you calling my grammy a whore?

50:15.335 --> 50:17.633
She was a product of the Depression, man.

50:19.500 --> 50:20.627
No New Deal for her.

50:21.959 --> 50:27.008
So, look who's decided
to grace us with her presence.

50:27.168 --> 50:28.175
Did I miss anything?

50:28.293 --> 50:30.840
I guess we can make
our big announcement.

50:31.001 --> 50:34.509
Fanfare, please.

50:34.626 --> 50:38.465
The Lords are coming to Salem
for one night only

50:38.584 --> 50:41.678
and we've got the tickets.

50:42.834 --> 50:47.220
In fact, we've got all the tickets.
The show is free.

50:47.335 --> 50:49.918
This is the Lords of Salem.

51:03.959 --> 51:06.342
<i>Satan.</i>

51:06.501 --> 51:09.511
<i>Spirit of the earth.</i>

51:13.501 --> 51:16.179
<i>Reveal yourselves...</i>

51:16.293 --> 51:19.967
<i>to our master of the Lords.</i>

51:23.918 --> 51:26.714
<i>Open wide the gates of hell</i>

51:26.834 --> 51:31.919
<i>and come forth
from your blessed abyss.</i>

52:01.667 --> 52:03.671
Heidi?

52:04.584 --> 52:07.168
Heidi, I'm here.

52:07.335 --> 52:09.668
If you unlock the door, I can help you.

53:12.626 --> 53:15.755
<i>I was a little confused
about the message you left.</i>

53:15.876 --> 53:18.886
<i>What exactly is it
that you needed from me?</i>

53:19.001 --> 53:20.720
<i>Well, I'm not sure, you know.</i>

53:20.834 --> 53:24.378
<i>I have a few questions
about your book here.</i>

53:24.501 --> 53:29.846
I thought somebody
besides dear old Mum had a copy.

53:29.959 --> 53:33.053
Let's see.
Is this research for a new book?

53:33.168 --> 53:36.013
Well, maybe, but I'm just trying
to track something right now.

53:36.168 --> 53:38.585
So, what can I do you for?

53:38.709 --> 53:42.846
Well, couple of days ago
I was at this radio station,

53:43.001 --> 53:44.553
I was hawking my book,

53:44.668 --> 53:49.800
and I heard this music
by a group called the Lords of Salem.

53:49.918 --> 53:53.426
And I thought that this group and
this music seemed a little odd,

53:53.542 --> 53:56.838
so I did a little research, blah, blah,
blah, and found it in your book.

53:57.001 --> 54:02.678
Let me guess. The diary
of the Reverend Jon Hawthorne, right?

54:02.793 --> 54:07.842
Yeah. I was wondering if by any chance
you have the complete diary or...?

54:08.001 --> 54:11.131
No, no, no, but I did read it in depth.

54:11.250 --> 54:13.301
And do you remember anything of interest?

54:13.417 --> 54:17.175
Well, basically Hawthorne was obsessed

54:17.334 --> 54:24.220
with, in his words, "the master witch"
Margaret Morgan and her coven of six,

54:24.334 --> 54:26.669
whom he dubbed the Lords of Salem.

54:26.834 --> 54:29.512
Why do you think he was obsessed
with this particular coven?

54:29.626 --> 54:34.342
He thought they were hiding out
in the woods around Salem

54:34.459 --> 54:36.296
making the devil's music

54:36.417 --> 54:41.170
for the purpose of possessing the souls
of the Salem women.

54:41.292 --> 54:44.671
Yeah, well, I gathered that
from the few pages that I read,

54:44.793 --> 54:50.174
that he and his group
eventually killed Morgan and the coven.

54:50.292 --> 54:52.924
- Right.
- That's where the pages end.

54:53.043 --> 54:56.717
So I was wondering if there's
any other light you could shed on this?

54:56.834 --> 54:59.845
Well, yeah, actually, yeah.

55:00.001 --> 55:04.671
Let's not forget
the curse of Margaret Morgan.

55:04.793 --> 55:08.052
- What curse?
- Oh, God.

55:08.168 --> 55:11.179
The curse section. That's the best part.

55:11.334 --> 55:14.677
This is where the diary gets so bizarro.

55:14.793 --> 55:18.669
The final sections of the diary just...

55:18.793 --> 55:21.887
Well, I mean,
it's complete rambling nonsense, right?

55:22.001 --> 55:23.969
- Let's hear it.
- OK.

55:24.085 --> 55:28.552
Well, apparently during the execution,

55:28.668 --> 55:34.214
while the coven and Margaret Morgan
were being roasted alive,

55:34.334 --> 55:37.677
Margaret Morgan put a curse
on the females of Salem.

55:37.834 --> 55:42.718
Something about the forever deaths
of the daughters' daughters

55:42.834 --> 55:46.710
and other crazy stuff like that.

55:46.834 --> 55:50.259
Also she called Hawthorne's bloodline

55:50.376 --> 55:55.626
"the vessel by which the devil's child
would inherit the earth".

55:57.251 --> 55:59.752
Whatever the fuck that meant.

56:11.001 --> 56:13.051
Had to get out of that apartment, man.

56:14.626 --> 56:17.173
One more second in there,
I was really gonna lose it.

56:17.292 --> 56:19.212
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

56:19.334 --> 56:21.337
Watch. It's hot.

56:23.376 --> 56:25.379
I got nothing going today.

56:35.835 --> 56:37.719
<i>Well, Mr Mercy...</i>

56:37.835 --> 56:39.838
What?

56:40.835 --> 56:43.087
What?

56:43.209 --> 56:46.670
You always make that sound
when something's on your mind.

56:46.793 --> 56:48.049
No, I don't.

56:48.167 --> 56:52.173
Come on, man. You know I'm clean
if that's what you're worrying about.

56:52.334 --> 56:54.337
I know.

56:56.001 --> 57:00.885
I mean, but, come on,
your behavior at the station last night,

57:01.001 --> 57:03.005
just, you know, kind of...

57:03.167 --> 57:04.258
What?

57:06.626 --> 57:11.342
- Freaky?
- Freaky. You don't know the half of it.

57:20.126 --> 57:21.465
I know this sounds stupid,

57:21.584 --> 57:25.638
but I really think that Lords record
is fucking with me.

57:25.751 --> 57:27.837
What do you mean, fucking with you?

57:27.960 --> 57:29.963
Every time I hear it, it's like...

57:33.918 --> 57:36.134
Every...

57:37.459 --> 57:39.877
Oh, man. Let me get...

57:41.126 --> 57:43.129
Just stay calm, all right?

57:46.501 --> 57:49.463
Hello? Yeah, yeah.
I... I need an ambulance.

57:49.584 --> 57:52.714
My friend, she's coughing up blood
and she's got stomach pains.

57:52.835 --> 57:55.715
Yeah, we're on the comer of Hodges,
Hodges and Derby.

57:57.334 --> 57:58.674
Don't worry.

58:07.501 --> 58:09.634
<i>And I have.</i>

58:09.751 --> 58:12.168
<i>Let's be sensible about this.</i>

58:12.334 --> 58:15.795
<i>Who knows?
We might be useful to each other.</i>

58:15.918 --> 58:21.927
<i>Forever more, our eyes will burn
with sights of the lamented</i>

58:22.042 --> 58:27.471
<i>Forever more, our pain will be
as the pain of a woman tied down,</i>

58:27.584 --> 58:34.304
<i>unable to move,
where one fiery worm eats into her vitals.</i>

58:34.418 --> 58:36.670
<i>The woman screams for unconsciousness,</i>

58:36.835 --> 58:41.504
<i>but there is no unconsciousness In hell.</i>

58:41.626 --> 58:44.471
<i>The worm eats and eats</i>

58:44.584 --> 58:48.009
<i>and eats and eats...</i>

59:45.959 --> 59:48.887
<i>Heidi, Heidi.</i>

59:50.084 --> 59:51.506
<i>Heidi</i>

59:51.668 --> 59:53.671
<i>Heidi</i>

59:56.042 --> 59:59.053
<i>Heidi, Heidi.</i>

59:59.835 --> 01:00:01.838
<i>Heidi</i>

01:00:02.376 --> 01:00:03.846
<i>Heidi</i>

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:32.258
Hey.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.838
Thanks, man.

01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:00.053
<i>What is your name?</i>

01:01:01.459 --> 01:01:03.130
<i>Comment vous appelez-vous?</i>

01:01:03.751 --> 01:01:07.010
<i>Comment vous appelez-vous?</i>

01:01:07.126 --> 01:01:10.337
<i>Where is the bathroom?</i>

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:12.255
<i>OÃ¹ est la salle de bain?</i>

01:01:12.376 --> 01:01:16.003
<i>OÃ¹ est la salle de bain</i>

01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:18.964
<i>Where is the train station?</i>

01:01:32.834 --> 01:01:35.003
<i>Where is the restaurant?</i>

01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:38.845
<i>- OÃ¹ est le restaurant?
- OÃ¹ est...</i>

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:43.713
Where is...

01:01:45.042 --> 01:01:46.085
restaurant?

01:01:46.209 --> 01:01:48.675
<i>This completes Lesson One.</i>

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:52.343
<i>Please turn the tape over.
Merci beaucoup.</i>

01:02:18.293 --> 01:02:20.378
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:02:20.501 --> 01:02:23.843
I might be wrong, but I thought
maybe you could use some company.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.920
I could.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:28.176
You don't look so good, darling.

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:34.043
- What's that?
- This is lovely calming tea.

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:36.964
But, more importantly,
chocolate-chip scones.

01:02:37.084 --> 01:02:39.502
I think they might be slightly overdone.

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:42.796
Keep going, Heidi. Good girl.

01:02:42.917 --> 01:02:44.755
There we go.

01:02:50.917 --> 01:02:54.177
Heidi LaRoc, let's see who you really are.

01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:57.883
Adelheid Elizabeth Hawthorne.

01:03:12.084 --> 01:03:15.711
Let's see who you're connected to.

01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:30.220
And you are...

01:03:30.334 --> 01:03:32.135
Reverend Jonathan Hawthorne.

01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:34.088
Fuck me.

01:03:39.334 --> 01:03:41.172
Oh, man.

01:03:41.293 --> 01:03:43.710
That's right, darling.

01:03:43.834 --> 01:03:46.549
You just lay back and rest.

01:03:46.668 --> 01:03:48.469
Don't you worry.

01:03:48.585 --> 01:03:51.381
We're gonna be right here if you need us.

01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:54.843
That's right. Good girl.

01:03:59.418 --> 01:04:01.752
<i>Little baby.</i>

01:04:03.168 --> 01:04:05.171
There.

01:04:12.043 --> 01:04:13.169
Hello?

01:04:13.293 --> 01:04:16.339
Yes, I'd like to speak
to Heidi Hawthorne, please.

01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:19.843
I'm sorry, darling,
you've got a wrong number.

01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:22.591
Please do not call back.

01:04:22.709 --> 01:04:25.803
It's so frightfully rude of you
to call at this hour.

01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:34.174
Who was that?

01:04:34.293 --> 01:04:36.296
Lord knows.

01:04:37.834 --> 01:04:40.513
Sonny, get the chair.

01:05:03.418 --> 01:05:07.555
Oh, Father, you give us the venom.

01:05:07.667 --> 01:05:11.010
Fill us with your essence.

01:05:11.168 --> 01:05:14.463
Let it burn through our souls
and our minds.

01:05:15.501 --> 01:05:17.551
We trample on the cross.

01:05:18.834 --> 01:05:23.339
We spit upon the book of lies.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:26.837
We desecrate the virgin whore.

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:34.294
We blaspheme his holy spirit
and we rejoice in his suffering.

01:05:35.376 --> 01:05:39.843
Guide this child
still in the shackles of the oppressor.

01:05:39.959 --> 01:05:44.511
Help her break free
from his tyrant ways.

01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:50.337
Entice her to take the precious bite

01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:53.760
from whence she shall be delivered.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:59.133
You are the dragon, Lord Satan.

01:09:58.834 --> 01:10:00.837
Hey, where are you going?
Lunch is almost ready.

01:10:01.001 --> 01:10:04.461
I'm gonna go down for a second
to the museum.

01:10:04.584 --> 01:10:07.713
I gotta check on something
for the new exhibits.

01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:09.968
What are they gonna do
when you retire?

01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:14.836
Oh, well, probably sell the place
and start a Starbucks.

01:10:14.959 --> 01:10:17.637
- I'll be back in an hour.
- OK. Love you.

01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:18.758
Love you.

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:02.341
Hello.

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:04.462
Hey, it's me.

01:11:05.793 --> 01:11:07.049
<i>Hey</i>

01:11:07.168 --> 01:11:11.968
Yeah, I was just calling to say what's up?

01:11:12.085 --> 01:11:14.004
And make sure everything's all right.

01:11:14.168 --> 01:11:17.343
OK.

01:11:18.668 --> 01:11:22.590
So... is everything all right?

01:11:25.459 --> 01:11:27.628
Yeah.

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:29.635
<i>Yeah...</i>

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:31.968
<i>Hey, I was thinking, maybe we can</i>

01:11:32.085 --> 01:11:34.088
hook up before the show...

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:38.761
and come by,
get some food or something.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.630
Maybe talk about things.

01:11:43.793 --> 01:11:45.796
No, I'm all right.

01:11:48.668 --> 01:11:51.678
I'm not feeling very hungry any more.

01:11:53.334 --> 01:11:56.344
<i>OK no, no, I understand that.</i>

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.176
<i>I could swing by around 10:30.</i>

01:12:01.334 --> 01:12:03.384
<i>We can head to the gig together.</i>

01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:05.504
No.

01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:09.629
I'll get there on my own. Bye.

01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:13.294
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't... don't... don't hang up.

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:17.174
<i>I know in the past I, I didn't understand</i>

01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:20.338
<i>and I'm not saying I understand now,
but I'm here.</i>

01:12:23.085 --> 01:12:25.088
Whenever you need me.

01:12:26.501 --> 01:12:28.504
I know.

01:12:30.501 --> 01:12:32.504
I'll always know.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:38.967
Bye.

01:12:44.001 --> 01:12:46.335
<i>You love him, don't you?</i>

01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:24.553
Excuse me.
Does Heidi Hawthorne live here?

01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:28.341
Do you perhaps mean
Adelheid Elizabeth Hawthorne?

01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:30.504
Yes, as a matter of fact I do, yes.

01:13:31.376 --> 01:13:32.798
You look familiar.

01:13:32.918 --> 01:13:35.964
Oh, well, I work
at the wax museum part time.

01:13:36.084 --> 01:13:39.924
You probably saw me
walking back and forth on my lunch hour.

01:13:40.043 --> 01:13:43.054
Oh, yes. The wonderful wax museum.

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:47.553
We have to teach our impressionable
children about Salem's glorious past.

01:13:47.668 --> 01:13:50.678
Yes. Well, I'm Francis Matthais.

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:54.135
Now, are you a friend or foe?

01:13:54.251 --> 01:13:58.209
Oh, well, I don't know
if I'm exactly a friend,

01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:00.966
but I'm definitely not a foe.

01:14:01.084 --> 01:14:03.846
I'm a mild acquaintance.

01:14:04.001 --> 01:14:06.383
- And you are?
- Lacy.

01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:08.338
I look after Heidi.

01:14:09.459 --> 01:14:12.090
<i>Oh, well, could I see her?</i>

01:14:13.292 --> 01:14:15.711
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

01:14:15.835 --> 01:14:17.885
<i>Why don't you come on in?</i>

01:14:18.001 --> 01:14:21.260
<i>Heidi's just stepped out for a moment,
but we can wait in my apartment'.</i>

01:14:21.376 --> 01:14:23.794
<i>- She won't be long.
- Oh, well, I can come back later.</i>

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:25.174
<i>No. No, no, no.</i>

01:14:26.126 --> 01:14:27.845
Come on in. Come and have some tea.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.963
All right.

01:14:45.334 --> 01:14:47.337
So...

01:14:48.626 --> 01:14:50.925
Are you a married man, Francis?

01:14:51.459 --> 01:14:56.093
Yes, as a matter of fact.
26 years in November.

01:14:58.376 --> 01:15:01.173
26 happy years?

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:04.720
For the most part, yeah.

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:06.672
Local girl?

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:10.669
No, she's not a Salem lifer like me.

01:15:10.835 --> 01:15:12.672
She's a Venezuelan girl, actually.

01:15:12.835 --> 01:15:14.802
Any children?

01:15:14.918 --> 01:15:17.845
No. We never got around to children.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.844
Well, that's understandable.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.005
Children are a bit of a waste.
Most are a total loss.

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:28.797
So few have anything of substance
to really offer us.

01:15:30.084 --> 01:15:36.969
But... on the rare occasion
a special child appears.

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.752
Well, I never really
thought about it that way.

01:15:41.876 --> 01:15:44.341
I just didn't like the idea
of changing diapers.

01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:49.256
Is Megan spinning her little philosophies
on the value of breeding again?

01:15:50.334 --> 01:15:53.179
Don't mind her.
She lives in her own little bubble.

01:15:54.543 --> 01:15:58.501
So, Mr Matthais, what was so important

01:15:58.626 --> 01:16:01.886
that you had to rush over here
and see our dear little Heidi?

01:16:02.001 --> 01:16:04.335
Well, it wasn't that important.

01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:07.511
It was just a record that she played
on her show the other night.

01:16:07.668 --> 01:16:11.674
Oh, really? And what record
would that be, Mr Matthais?

01:16:11.793 --> 01:16:15.217
Some record by a group called the Lords.

01:16:15.334 --> 01:16:18.713
You know, don't take this the wrong way,

01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:23.753
but aren't you a little old
to like that shit?

01:16:25.459 --> 01:16:30.674
Yeah. I was a guest on the show, actually,
if you can imagine that.

01:16:30.835 --> 01:16:35.718
Sonny, darling,
would you mind getting me the sugar?

01:16:39.835 --> 01:16:42.216
So, anyway, I just had some information

01:16:42.334 --> 01:16:45.049
I thought she might find interesting.

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:47.253
I'm sure she would.

01:16:48.751 --> 01:16:55.341
Mr Matthais, you strike me as a man
who would normally mind his own business.

01:16:56.751 --> 01:16:59.466
I do, do I?

01:16:59.585 --> 01:17:01.338
Why are you laughing?

01:17:02.376 --> 01:17:04.177
I'm not laughing.

01:17:04.293 --> 01:17:07.303
Is something suddenly funny?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.341
- You know, I think I'll come back...
- You know what I think?

01:17:15.459 --> 01:17:16.467
I don't have a clue.

01:17:16.585 --> 01:17:21.503
I think you've come here to get inside
my dear little Heidi's head.

01:17:21.668 --> 01:17:25.295
Get inside her head and fuck her brain.

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:30.002
Have you come here to stick
your nosy cock inside her head

01:17:30.126 --> 01:17:32.295
and fuck her brain, Mr Matthais?

01:17:32.418 --> 01:17:35.049
- I think I should go.
- Oh, no!

01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:43.752
- Good.
- That felt good.

01:17:56.126 --> 01:18:01.838
Well, if it isn't my favorite fairy story.

01:18:01.959 --> 01:18:04.969
<i>The End of the American Watch.</i>

01:18:06.626 --> 01:18:12.836
I'll bet there are all sorts of
juicy stories of cunty witches

01:18:12.959 --> 01:18:17.842
and the heroic deeds
of the fucking mighty Jon Hawthorne.

01:18:18.626 --> 01:18:21.209
It seems you'd love to tell
our little Heidi

01:18:21.334 --> 01:18:26.253
all about these spooky little tales
of judgment day.

01:18:27.668 --> 01:18:29.671
Sonny.

01:18:35.834 --> 01:18:37.174
No. No!

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.174
<i>Sugar</i>

01:19:02.668 --> 01:19:07.005
<i>I call my baby my sugar</i>

01:19:09.334 --> 01:19:11.503
<i>I never maybe...</i>

01:19:11.668 --> 01:19:13.671
What a waste of a good man.

01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:17.135
Yes. Such a pity.

01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:20.594
And he was never going to be able
to stop anything.

01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:22.677
Hey-ho.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:25.507
Anyone care for a fresh pot of tea?

01:19:25.626 --> 01:19:27.629
Lovely, darling.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.553
Hello, Whitey.

01:19:58.668 --> 01:20:00.671
Hi.

01:20:01.626 --> 01:20:03.178
Going somewhere, are we?

01:20:03.334 --> 01:20:05.088
Yeah, I was gonna go up and get Heidi.

01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:08.966
You look nervous. Are you nervous?

01:20:09.084 --> 01:20:11.845
No. Excuse me.

01:20:14.334 --> 01:20:18.553
Why don't you sit here with us?
We need to talk.

01:20:18.668 --> 01:20:20.588
No, really, I should get going.

01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:22.677
We've got this thing
we're gonna do tonight.

01:20:24.168 --> 01:20:26.929
Well, don't let us stand in your way.

01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:30.759
Yeah, sure.

01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:37.134
Take care of Heidi.
She means the world to us, you know.

01:21:32.335 --> 01:21:36.127
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come here.

01:21:40.501 --> 01:21:43.049
It's OK, Heidi.

01:21:43.168 --> 01:21:46.214
You can tell Whitey to wait outside.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.219
Wait for me outside.

01:21:50.293 --> 01:21:52.675
What the fuck is going on here?

01:21:52.834 --> 01:21:56.627
Please just wait for me outside. Just go.

01:21:59.626 --> 01:22:01.012
Come on, Whitey.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.387
Come on.

01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:07.254
Come with me.

01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:18.837
Man.

01:22:35.626 --> 01:22:37.545
- You look like death.
- Chill, man.

01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:39.469
We'll talk about this later, OK?

01:22:39.584 --> 01:22:40.710
- Later?
- Yeah, later.

01:22:40.834 --> 01:22:44.710
Don't tell me to chill.
I wanna know what the hell's going on.

01:22:44.834 --> 01:22:47.169
Just listen.
Let's just get through this tonight.

01:22:47.335 --> 01:22:50.215
Tomorrow we can start dealing with this.

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:55.670
Bye.

01:23:41.876 --> 01:23:44.424
Lord, hear us.

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:49.971
We are ready to bring
your precious child to this world.

01:23:50.084 --> 01:23:54.505
In memory of Satan,
you preach punishment and shame

01:23:54.667 --> 01:23:57.251
to those who would
emancipate themselves

01:23:57.376 --> 01:24:00.422
and repudiate the slavery of the Church.

01:24:00.542 --> 01:24:04.419
Satan, come to us. We are ready.

01:24:05.459 --> 01:24:10.260
Satan, come to us. We are ready.

01:24:11.459 --> 01:24:16.378
Satan, come to us. We are ready.

01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:49.629
Welcome...

01:24:51.376 --> 01:24:53.924
whores of Salem.

01:24:56.501 --> 01:25:03.672
I can taste the foul stench
of your ancestors rotting

01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:09.503
in the folds of filth between your legs.

01:25:16.293 --> 01:25:19.920
The blood of your deaths

01:25:20.043 --> 01:25:24.759
shall be the eternity

01:25:24.876 --> 01:25:28.965
Of OUR resurrection.

01:25:33.501 --> 01:25:35.302
Heidi.

01:25:36.501 --> 01:25:38.919
The one.

01:25:39.043 --> 01:25:41.295
We've been waiting for you, Heidi.

01:25:42.251 --> 01:25:44.585
We've always...

01:25:46.501 --> 01:25:48.302
been waiting.

01:27:02.334 --> 01:27:06.885
<i>We honor you through our actions
and our thoughts.</i>

01:27:07.001 --> 01:27:11.007
<i>Each day that we live upon this earth,</i>

01:27:11.168 --> 01:27:15.968
<i>may we grow stronger in wisdom
and in our love for you.</i>

01:27:16.584 --> 01:27:23.506
<i>You are our father, our teacher,
our muse, our lover.</i>

01:27:23.668 --> 01:27:25.801
<i>We have taken your mark.</i>

01:27:42.459 --> 01:27:47.176
<i>Without exception, death will come
to each and every one of us.</i>

01:27:47.334 --> 01:27:51.755
<i>The devils of this earth
will rattle on our very coffins</i>

01:27:51.876 --> 01:27:53.464
<i>with cloven hooves.</i>

01:27:53.584 --> 01:27:58.136
<i>The body we pamper
will become a city of corruption,</i>

01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:00.966
<i>a horror onto this earth.</i>

01:28:01.085 --> 01:28:05.552
<i>Our own mothers
could not bear to look upon it.</i>

01:28:06.751 --> 01:28:10.970
<i>But if we are saved
our bodies will rise again,</i>

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:13.716
<i>free and glorious when Christ comes.</i>

01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:25.256
<i>But if we lose our battle with temptation
and choose to ride upon the goat,</i>

01:28:25.376 --> 01:28:28.671
<i>we know what our agony will be.</i>

01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:32.378
<i>Forever more we shall be awash</i>

01:28:32.501 --> 01:28:35.677
<i>in the burning rivers of the dead.</i>

01:28:35.793 --> 01:28:42.382
<i>Forever more the stench of hell
and the rotting flesh of the damned</i>

01:28:42.501 --> 01:28:44.551
<i>Will fill our nostrils.</i>

01:28:44.668 --> 01:28:48.377
<i>Forever more our ears will resound</i>

01:28:48.501 --> 01:28:51.712
<i>with the screams of the tormented.</i>

01:28:51.834 --> 01:28:52.877
<i>Forever more.</i>

01:29:38.085 --> 01:29:41.427
It was our Lord Satan

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:45.382
that took you to the mill of the grave

01:29:45.501 --> 01:29:49.637
so that you should thus become

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:56.589
the bread and the blood
of revelation and revulsion.

01:32:40.626 --> 01:32:46.469
<i>And what costume
shall the poor girl wear</i>

01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:54.675
<i>To all tomorrow's parties?</i>

01:32:57.459 --> 01:33:03.504
<i>Hand-me-down dress
from who knows where</i>

01:33:06.543 --> 01:33:11.675
<i>To all tomorrow's parties</i>

01:33:14.293 --> 01:33:19.342
<i>And where will she go
and what shall she do</i>

01:33:19.501 --> 01:33:23.757
<i>When midnight comes around?</i>

01:33:27.167 --> 01:33:32.928
<i>She'll turn once more
to Sunday's crown</i>

01:33:36.251 --> 01:33:40.885
<i>And cry behind the door</i>

01:34:01.959 --> 01:34:06.012
<i>8:45 and this is the WIQZ news break.</i>

01:34:07.501 --> 01:34:09.587
<i>The dead bodies

<i>were discovered this morning in what
appears to be an apparent mass suicide.</i>

01:34:16.001 --> 01:34:18.467
<i>The gruesome scene was discovered
in the early morning hours</i>

01:34:18.585 --> 01:34:21.595
<i>by Donald Felix,
a janitor at the Salem Palladium.</i>

01:34:21.710 --> 01:34:24.388
<i>At first I thought they were
mannequins left on the stage, you know.</i>

01:34:24.501 --> 01:34:27.843
<i>But as I go closer,
I could see they were real.</i>

01:34:27.959 --> 01:34:31.005
<i>It was a gruesome display, man.
...I don't know.</i>

01:34:31.167 --> 01:34:32.554
I just called 911.

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:35.002
<i>The society's members
are all descendants</i>

01:34:35.167 --> 01:34:39.007
<i>of the original Salem village

01:34:39.167 --> 01:34:42.759
<i>Police remain puzzled and have no motives

01:34:42.876 --> 01:34:45.721
<i>Mayor Joseph Campbell is scheduled

01:34:45.834 --> 01:34:47.636
