WEBVTT

00:03.567 --> 00:05.367
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS PLACE SO CROWDED.

00:05.367 --> 00:06.767
- YEAH, EVER SINCE
MARCO TOOK OVER,

00:06.767 --> 00:09.067
THE FOOD IS SUPPOSED TO BE
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:09.067 --> 00:10.567
OH, THANKS.

00:10.567 --> 00:12.833
- WAS THAT STEFANIA?
- NO.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.367
- WHICH ONE IS SHE?

00:14.367 --> 00:16.033
- AMY, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.567
THERE'S PLENTY
OF OTHER RESTAURANTS

00:17.567 --> 00:19.767
WHERE ROBERT'S EX-GIRLFRIENDS
DON'T WORK.

00:19.767 --> 00:22.400
- NO, NO, NO,
SHE TOOK MY BOYFRIEND.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.167
NOW SHE CAN TAKE MY ORDER.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.167
- YEAH, BUT I JUST
DON'T GET--

00:27.167 --> 00:28.967
OH, MY GOD.

00:28.967 --> 00:32.200
HOW IS THIS SO GOOD?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.200
THIS IS JUST A BREADSTICK!
YOU GOT TO TASTE THIS.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.633
- NO, NO,
I'M NOT GOING TO EAT.

00:35.633 --> 00:38.200
I WANT TO BE THIN
WHEN I SEE HER.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.400
- LISTEN, RELAX.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.200
I'VE SEEN STEFANIA.
SHE'S NOTHING.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.900
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.567
- YEAH?

00:46.567 --> 00:47.967
- HELLO, DEBRA!

00:47.967 --> 00:50.400
OH, HELLO. I AM STEFANIA.

01:11.667 --> 01:14.400
- SEE?
NOTHING.

01:18.767 --> 01:20.433
- YOU'RE STEFANIA?

01:20.433 --> 01:23.267
- SI.
AND YOU ARE?

01:23.267 --> 01:27.700
- I'M AMY,
ROBERT'S OTHER EX-GIRLFRIEND,

01:27.700 --> 01:30.033
OR, AS I'LL BE KNOWN
FROM NOW ON,

01:30.033 --> 01:32.267
THE PLAIN ONE.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.767
- YOU WERE ALSO
ROBERTO'S GIRLFRIEND?

01:37.767 --> 01:39.067
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,

01:39.067 --> 01:40.533
PRETTY MUCH AT THE SAME TIME
YOU WERE.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.533
- UM, YOU KNOW, I WAS LOOKING
AT YOUR RED WINES.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.700
WHICH CHIANTI WOULD ARRIVE
THE SOONEST?

01:44.700 --> 01:47.433
- BUT ROBERTO DID NOT
EVER SPEAK OF YOU.

01:47.433 --> 01:50.767
- YEAH, HE WAS GOOD
LIKE THAT.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.133
- IF I HAD KNOWN...

01:58.833 --> 02:02.533
- I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU SAID,
BUT I LIKE HOW IT ENDED.

02:02.533 --> 02:06.767
- I AM SO,
SO SORRY TO YOU.

02:06.767 --> 02:09.767
YOU MUST HATE ME
FOREVER.

02:09.767 --> 02:13.967
- OH, NO, THERE'S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.233
I'M NOT REALLY MAD AT YOU.

02:15.233 --> 02:16.567
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

02:16.567 --> 02:18.400
'CAUSE ROBERT'S
THE PROBLEM HERE.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.067
BUT HE'S OUT OF BOTH
OF YOUR LIVES NOW.

02:21.067 --> 02:23.633
- WE ARE BOTH
VERY LUCKY WOMEN.

02:23.633 --> 02:24.800
- AMEN TO THAT.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.533
- HEY, MR. FOGAGNOLO,
IS MY PIZZA READY?

02:28.533 --> 02:33.233
- IS READY
WHEN I SAY IS READY.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.667
- THAT'S A GOOD POLICY.

02:36.667 --> 02:40.767
- OH, LOOK,
THERE'S MY LITTLE "BASTARDO."

02:40.767 --> 02:43.033
[laughter]

02:43.033 --> 02:44.433
- HEY.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.300
- HI, RAY.

02:48.367 --> 02:51.367
- EVERYTHING, UH, OKAY?

02:51.367 --> 02:53.100
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.400
- OH, JUST, YOU KNOW,

02:55.400 --> 02:59.300
JUST SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU TWO HOBNOBBING.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.567
- ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

03:01.567 --> 03:04.867
- WE BOTH
HATE YOUR BROTHER.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.767
- OH, OH, THAT'S NICE.

03:06.767 --> 03:08.933
- HEY, DID ROBERT EVER TAKE YOU
TO THE MOVIES?

03:08.933 --> 03:09.967
- UH, YES.

03:09.967 --> 03:12.967
- THAT'S FUN, ISN'T IT?

03:12.967 --> 03:15.033
ALL HIS LITTLE RULES.

03:15.033 --> 03:17.033
"SHH! NO TALKING!

03:17.033 --> 03:19.067
MOVIE! NO TALKING!"

03:19.067 --> 03:20.700
- YES!

03:20.700 --> 03:23.167
"I DON'T LIKE TO SHARE
MY GOOD & PLENTY."

03:23.167 --> 03:24.700
HE IS LIKE IDIOT.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.167
- HEY, HEY, HEY,

03:28.167 --> 03:29.500
THAT'S A LITTLE ROUGH,
ISN'T IT?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.600
HE HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT
ABOUT THE TALKING.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.500
IT'S VERY RUDE.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.667
- NOW IS READY.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.433
- PAPA, LISTEN TO THIS.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.767
ROBERTO USED ME TO CHEAT
ON THIS NICE LADY.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.367
- HE TELLS ME HE BREAK UP
WITH STEFANIA

03:48.367 --> 03:51.700
BECAUSE HE NO LIKE GIRLS.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.400
- [chuckles]

03:58.567 --> 04:00.500
AMERICANS.

04:04.433 --> 04:08.633
- YOUR BROTHER--
HE IS NO GOOD.

04:08.633 --> 04:11.100
- BASTARDO.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.200
- THIS ONE I LIKE.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.533
SHE EATS FOR FREE.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.500
- OKAY, RAY,
YOU CAN GO NOW.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.167
WE WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ROBERT SOME MORE.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.667
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED?

04:24.667 --> 04:27.700
YOU NEED A BIG, BLACK POT
THAT YOU CAN ALL STIR.

04:27.700 --> 04:31.033
- HEY, WAIT, ARE YOU TAKING
THAT BACK TO EAT WITH ROBERT?

04:32.667 --> 04:34.567
- I THINK WHAT I DO
WITH MY PIZZA

04:34.567 --> 04:36.867
IS ENTIRELY MY BUSINESS,
OKAY?

04:36.867 --> 04:38.900
- THIS PIZZA
IS FOR ROBERTO?

04:38.900 --> 04:40.700
- HEY, STOP THAT!

04:40.700 --> 04:43.533
STAY OFF THE SAUSAGE.
IT'S MINE!

04:43.533 --> 04:45.567
OH, THAT'S NICE.
OH, VERY NICE.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.467
VERY NICE.
LOOK AT THAT.

04:47.467 --> 04:50.167
HOW ABOUT I TELL
YOUR FATHER ABOUT THIS, HUH?

04:50.167 --> 04:52.167
HEY, MARCO...

04:52.167 --> 04:54.700
HAVE A NICE DAY.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.033
- WHERE YA BEEN?
WE'RE STARVING HERE!

05:02.033 --> 05:03.567
- SORRY.

05:03.567 --> 05:06.333
- SORRY'S NOT GOING TO BRING
BACK YOUR FUDGE RIPPLE.

05:11.233 --> 05:14.133
- WHAT, DID YOU
FLIP THE CAR?

05:19.767 --> 05:22.700
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

05:22.700 --> 05:24.967
- THAT'S JUST
A LITTLE "HI, HOW ARE YA?"

05:24.967 --> 05:28.000
FROM STEFANIA AND AMY.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.900
- WHAT?
STEFANIA AND AMY?

05:29.900 --> 05:31.433
- THAT'S RIGHT.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.400
THEY'RE BOTH SITTING TOGETHER
AT WHAT IS NOW

05:33.400 --> 05:36.467
MARCO'S ALL-AMERICAN
PIZZERIA USA.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.667
AND THEY'RE RIPPING INTO YOU

05:40.667 --> 05:44.033
LIKE TINY TIM
ON A CHRISTMAS HAM.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.233
- OH, MY GOD.

05:50.233 --> 05:53.067
- HOLY CRAP!

05:53.067 --> 05:55.200
THIS IS--

05:55.200 --> 05:58.033
HOLY CRAP!

05:58.033 --> 06:00.367
MMM. MMM.

06:00.367 --> 06:01.733
- WELL,
THAT'S JUST PERFECT.

06:01.733 --> 06:03.467
MARCO HAS DELICIOUS FOOD,

06:03.467 --> 06:06.633
AND NOW IT'S A GATHERING PLACE
FOR EVERYONE WHO HATES ME.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.700
- NO WONDER IT GOT
GOOD REVIEWS.

06:12.767 --> 06:17.333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW BAD MY LIFE IS.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.667
- I'M SORRY, MAN.
I STOOD UP FOR YOU.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.733
OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS "HOLY CRAP."

06:24.133 --> 06:26.600
- YOU STOOD UP FOR ME?
- WHAT? YEAH.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.767
- OH, COME ON, RAYMOND,
IF PEOPLE ARE TRASHING ME,

06:28.767 --> 06:32.200
YOU'RE RIGHT UP FRONT
WITH THE BATON.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.700
- NO!
I WASN'T TRASHING YOU.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.567
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
OKAY, LISTEN,

06:36.567 --> 06:39.000
JUST THE FACT THAT YOU
HAD TO SAY YOU STOOD UP FOR ME

06:39.000 --> 06:41.200
MEANS THAT YOU DIDN'T.
- I DID.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.467
THEY WERE INSULTING YOU,
AND I TOLD THEM TO STOP.

06:43.467 --> 06:46.800
- THEY WERE INSULTING YOU.
HE TOLD THEM TO STOP.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.567
[laughs]

06:50.567 --> 06:51.567
- I DID!

06:51.567 --> 06:53.200
- YEAH, YEAH,
SURE, YOU DID.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.033
- WHAT, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?
GOOD, FINE.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.100
MAYBE YOU ARE A BASTARDO.

06:59.700 --> 07:00.767
- WHAT?

07:00.767 --> 07:02.767
- EVERYBODY KNOWS IT, MAN!

07:02.767 --> 07:05.133
I'LL TELL YOU THIS:
YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT

07:05.133 --> 07:08.367
'CAUSE MARCO NOW KNOWS
YOU LIKE GIRLS.

07:10.667 --> 07:13.233
- YOU DO LIKE GIRLS?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.133
- OKAY, DAD.

07:15.133 --> 07:19.133
- THEN WHY DO YOU WALK
THAT WAY?

07:28.600 --> 07:29.933
- HI.

07:29.933 --> 07:30.967
- OH!

07:30.967 --> 07:33.367
OH, YOU STARTLED ME.

07:33.367 --> 07:34.867
HOW ARE YOU, ROBBIE?

07:34.867 --> 07:36.767
- FINE.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.467
ACTUALLY, TERRIBLE.

07:38.467 --> 07:40.800
I'M PATHETIC,
I'M A LOSER,

07:40.800 --> 07:43.300
AND EVERYBODY HATES ME.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.600
COULD YOU MAKE ME SOMETHING
TO EAT?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.233
- OF COURSE, DEAR.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
THERE YOU GO.
BYE-BYE, DEAR.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.600
- MA, MA, MA, MA,
MA, MA, W-WAIT!

07:55.600 --> 07:57.200
WHAT IS THIS?

07:57.200 --> 07:59.867
- WELL, DON'T YOU LIKE
POTATO CHIPS ANYMORE?

07:59.867 --> 08:01.300
- NO, I-I DO,

08:01.300 --> 08:02.500
BUT COULDN'T YOU
MAKE ME SOMETHING?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
I'M REALLY FEELING DOWN HERE.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.667
- I'M SORRY, ROBBIE,
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

08:06.667 --> 08:08.933
SEE, I'M KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

08:08.933 --> 08:11.300
BUT COME BACK LATER,
AND I'LL MAKE YOU A PLATE.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.667
- ALL RIGHT.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.700
- ROBBIE, WAIT.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.400
HERE.
COME WITH ME.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.333
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:27.333 --> 08:29.667
- I THINK THIS WILL BE GOOD
FOR YOU, DEAR.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.067
- MA!

08:41.933 --> 08:44.000
- WE'VE BEEN TALKING.

08:48.633 --> 08:49.933
- UH...

08:49.933 --> 08:52.000
UM...

08:52.000 --> 08:53.767
UH...

08:53.767 --> 08:56.067
- SAY HELLO, ROBBIE.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.933
- HELLO, AMY.

08:58.933 --> 09:01.333
HELLO, STEFANIA.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.667
HELLO, AMY AND STEFANIA...

09:03.667 --> 09:06.500
TOGETHER
IN MY MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.533
- ROBERTO.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.700
- BASTARDO.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.833
- NOW, NOW, WE HAVE
STUFFED SHELLS

09:15.833 --> 09:17.567
AND THREE-BEAN SALAD,

09:17.567 --> 09:19.967
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST SIT DOWN
AND HELP YOURSELF?

09:19.967 --> 09:22.967
- MA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- NOTHING, DEAR, I'M JUST--

09:22.967 --> 09:25.033
- WHAT'S GOING ON,
OLD WOMAN?

09:26.733 --> 09:30.067
- I-I KNOW THIS ALL SEEMS
A LITTLE ODD...

09:30.067 --> 09:31.567
- ODD? ODD?

09:31.567 --> 09:35.867
HOW ABOUT HORRIFYING
BEYOND BELIEF?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.400
- WELL, DEAR,
YOU KNOW,

09:37.400 --> 09:39.633
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOND
OF BOTH AMY AND STEFANIA,

09:39.633 --> 09:42.700
AND ONCE I HEARD THAT THEY HAD
MET EACH OTHER, I JUST--

09:42.700 --> 09:44.367
- HOW'D YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THAT?

09:44.367 --> 09:46.033
- OH, THAT'S ALL
ANYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT.

09:46.033 --> 09:48.600
SO ANYWAY,

09:48.600 --> 09:50.733
I JUST WANT US TO HAVE
A NICE, CANDID CONVERSATION

09:50.733 --> 09:54.733
ABOUT LIFE AND ROMANCE
AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

09:59.033 --> 10:02.100
- REALLY?

10:02.100 --> 10:05.367
- I WROTE OUT A LIST.

10:05.367 --> 10:09.000
- MY SPELLING NOT SO GOOD.
I DO DRAWINGS.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.633
- YOU GAVE THEM HOMEWORK?

10:14.633 --> 10:16.567
- IT'S ALL TO HELP YOU,
DEAR.

10:16.567 --> 10:18.567
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
A BETTER MAN?

10:18.567 --> 10:20.967
- [laughs]
THAT ONE'S FUNNY.

10:20.967 --> 10:24.100
- I GIVE HIM TAIL
LIKE DONKEY.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.033
- I MEAN,
IT'S NO SECRET

10:26.033 --> 10:27.767
THAT YOU'VE HAD
RELATIONSHIP TROUBLES,

10:27.767 --> 10:30.400
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO LEARN
FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
IT SAVES ME

10:31.800 --> 10:36.633
FROM HAVING TO GO OVER IT AGAIN
WITH YOU LATER.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.833
- WELL, WHY DON'T WE REALLY
SAVE SOME TIME?

10:38.833 --> 10:41.833
TAKE THAT CHEESE KNIFE,
AND STICK IT IN MY NECK.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.200
- OH, SEE,

10:43.200 --> 10:45.033
HIS SENSE OF HUMOR
IS A LITTLE DARK.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.567
SHALL WE START THERE?

10:47.567 --> 10:49.000
- OH, ROBERT, HEY!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.300
- JUDY?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.367
- OOH, UNIFORM'S OFF.
GIVE ME A DRINK.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.333
FILL MY HAND
WITH SOMETHING GRAND.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.867
- BUT, MA, WHY IS JUDY HERE?
WE ONLY WORK TOGETHER.

10:57.867 --> 11:01.167
SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
NOT GIVING YOU GRANDCHILDREN.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.567
- I KNOW THAT,

11:02.567 --> 11:04.667
BUT SHE SPENDS 60 HOURS A WEEK
WITH YOU.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.600
SHE HAS A LOT TO BRING
TO THE TABLE.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.533
- GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
- NO, NO, NO.

11:13.533 --> 11:15.767
ROBBIE, ROBBIE, ROBBIE,
NO, NO, NO.

11:15.767 --> 11:17.367
YOU JUST SIT DOWN.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.100
SIT DOWN.
JUST RELAX.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.533
RELAX.

11:24.900 --> 11:25.900
OKAY.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.367
- IS THIS EVERYONE, MA?

11:28.367 --> 11:31.200
WHAT ABOUT JESSICA RUBLE?
REMEMBER HER?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.333
STOOD ME UP
FOR THE SENIOR DANCE?

11:33.333 --> 11:36.500
- NO, THAT WASN'T HER.
THAT WAS YOUR COUSIN RHONDA.

11:38.767 --> 11:41.167
NO, JESSICA RUBLE'S THE ONE
WHO PULLED YOUR PANTS DOWN

11:41.167 --> 11:43.500
AT YOUR SCHOOL ASSEMBLY.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.567
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHO WANTS TO BEGIN, HUH?

11:47.567 --> 11:50.567
HOW TO MAKE ROBBIE
A BETTER MATE.

11:50.567 --> 11:52.567
- I'LL START.

11:52.567 --> 11:54.900
WELL, WHENEVER
WE'D GO OUT TO DINNER

11:54.900 --> 11:56.533
AND WE'D ORDER DESSERT,

11:56.533 --> 11:59.567
HE'D ALWAYS SAY, "I'LL JUST HAVE
A TASTE OF YOURS."

11:59.567 --> 12:03.167
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE
A SHARK ATTACK!

12:03.167 --> 12:06.967
NOTHING BUT A LITTLE PUDDLE
OF FUDGE LEFT.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.100
ORDER YOUR OWN DESSERT!

12:11.167 --> 12:14.167
- OH, SWEETHEART,

12:14.167 --> 12:15.967
HAVE A CANNOLI.

12:15.967 --> 12:17.633
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM THESE.

12:17.633 --> 12:19.467
LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S A TWIG.

12:19.467 --> 12:22.967
- YEAH, WELL, THE MAN
DOES GET EXCITED ABOUT HIS FOOD,

12:22.967 --> 12:24.767
BUT WHEN HE GOES
AFTER MINE,

12:24.767 --> 12:27.533
I WHACK HIS KNUCKLES
WITH MY NIGHTSTICK.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.500
- I HAVE SOMETHING.
- OH, GOOD.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.567
- THE FACE,
THE FROWNY, FROWNY FACE.

12:34.567 --> 12:36.967
HE IS ALWAYS,
"I DON'T LIKE,

12:36.967 --> 12:40.133
I DON'T WANT,
I DON'T THINK."

12:40.133 --> 12:42.633
IT IS ANNOYING.

12:50.067 --> 12:53.800
- OH, I'VE SEEN THAT FACE.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.067
- DOES IT LOOK LIKE THIS?

12:57.067 --> 13:00.433
- YES,
AND VERY UNPLEASANT.

13:00.433 --> 13:03.767
- I AGREE WITH STEFANIA.
MAYBE HE NEEDS MEDICATION.

13:03.767 --> 13:07.167
- WHATEVER YOU GOT.

13:07.167 --> 13:10.400
- YES, UH, MAYBE
HE'S WRONG IN THE HEAD.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.467
THAT'S WHY HE LIKES
TO STAY HOME EVERY NIGHT

13:12.467 --> 13:15.000
AND SIT ON HIS UGLY SOFA.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.567
- OH, LADIES,
LET'S REMEMBER,

13:17.567 --> 13:20.400
ROBERT HAS
A VERY DEMANDING JOB.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.767
HE DOES NEED HIS DOWNTIME.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.333
- THANK YOU, JUDY.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.567
- BUT CAN SOMEONE
PLEASE TELL ME

13:25.567 --> 13:28.200
WHAT IS WITH THAT MAN
AND ONIONS?

13:28.200 --> 13:31.367
HE PUTS THEM
ON EVERYTHING.

13:31.367 --> 13:34.500
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.300
- ALL AREAS YOU COULD BE
WORKING ON, DEAR.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.400
- NO, AND I'D BE WILLING
TO PUT UP WITH ALL OF THEM

13:47.400 --> 13:49.433
IF IT WASN'T
FOR HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM.

13:52.733 --> 13:55.733
HIS TOTAL FEAR OF COMMITMENT.
- YES.

13:55.733 --> 13:57.500
- BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED

13:57.500 --> 13:59.700
TO OUR BREAKING UP
29 TIMES.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.700
- IT WASN'T 29--

14:00.700 --> 14:02.233
- LET HER SPEAK!

14:04.333 --> 14:06.367
- "I THINK I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.767
I THOUGHT I LOVED YOU.
I LOVE YOU."

14:08.767 --> 14:11.367
- "I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
I DON'T WANT YOU"--

14:11.367 --> 14:13.367
- "SHE'S THE ONE.
SHE'S NOT THE ONE.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.967
NO, I THINK IT'S THE OTHER ONE.
NO, SHE'S THE ONE."

14:15.967 --> 14:17.867
[all talking]

14:17.867 --> 14:21.100
- ALL RIGHT!

14:21.100 --> 14:23.533
LOOK,

14:23.533 --> 14:26.333
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE
ARE VERY ANGRY WITH ME,

14:26.333 --> 14:27.900
BUT THE FACT IS THAT

14:27.900 --> 14:30.967
THINGS JUST WEREN'T RIGHT
BETWEEN YOU AND ME...

14:30.967 --> 14:32.500
AND YOU AND ME.

14:34.133 --> 14:36.233
I APOLOGIZE
TO BOTH OF YOU

14:36.233 --> 14:38.167
FOR ANY HURT FEELINGS
THAT I MAY HAVE CAUSED,

14:38.167 --> 14:40.167
BUT I HOPE YOU BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YOU

14:40.167 --> 14:44.200
THAT IT WAS NEVER,
EVER MY INTENTION.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.167
- ALL RIGHT, ROBBIE, YOU DON'T
SEEM TO BE HELPING ANYMORE,

14:47.167 --> 14:49.700
SO MAYBE
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
- FINE.
FINE.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.667
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE HELL
I EVEN SAT DOWN

15:00.667 --> 15:03.700
FOR THIS ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.

15:05.967 --> 15:09.233
AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
WITH REGARDS TO THE ONIONS,

15:09.233 --> 15:11.533
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
TASTE BUDS

15:11.533 --> 15:16.233
THAT ARE MORE SENSITIVE
TO SAVORY THAN SWEET, JUDY.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.767
- FOR SOME REASON,
AND IT'S A MYSTERY TO ME,

15:24.767 --> 15:28.133
I'M THE ONLY WOMAN
HE GETS ALONG WITH.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.967
- DON'T FILL UP, RAY.
MY MEAT LOAF'S ALMOST READY.

15:35.967 --> 15:37.700
- GREAT.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.567
- IF AN ANGRY MOB
COMES TO THE DOOR

15:48.567 --> 15:52.100
WITH PITCHFORKS AND TORCHES,
IT'S FOR ME.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.800
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.733
- MA'S GOT AMY AND STEFANIA
OVER THERE.

15:56.733 --> 16:00.067
THEY'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FIX ME.

16:00.067 --> 16:02.067
- OH, WELL, I'M SURE
SHE MEANS WELL.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.067
- WHAT?

16:03.067 --> 16:05.300
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.167
YOU WANT TO STAY FOR DINNER?
I'M MAKING MEAT LOAF.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.500
- YEAH, THANKS, DEBRA,
BUT I'M NOT HUNGRY.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.533
- [whispers]
SMART MOVE.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.467
- I'M GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE ALONE.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.433
[sighs]

16:29.967 --> 16:33.333
- AHH, COME ON,
CHEER UP, MAN.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.767
LISTEN, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY THINK OVER THERE.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.967
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

16:46.967 --> 16:48.833
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.133
- OKAY.

16:50.133 --> 16:52.400
- NO, REALLY,
DON'T GIVE UP.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.067
THE RIGHT LADY
IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

16:55.067 --> 16:57.467
- THANKS.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.767
- I MEAN IT.

16:59.767 --> 17:02.533
- WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP.

17:05.533 --> 17:07.000
- WHAT?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
- "THE RIGHT LADY'S
OUT THERE."

17:09.000 --> 17:11.500
WELL, GUESS WHAT.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND HER.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.367
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.500
YOU'RE ALONE BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

17:15.500 --> 17:20.300
- I BELIEVE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THE MEETING ACROSS THE STREET.

17:27.367 --> 17:28.867
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

17:28.867 --> 17:31.567
YOU'VE CREATED AN IMAGE
OF THIS IDEAL WOMAN

17:31.567 --> 17:33.400
SO THAT
WHEN REGULAR WOMEN--

17:33.400 --> 17:35.433
REGULAR, WONDERFUL,
REAL WOMEN--

17:35.433 --> 17:37.700
FALL SHORT, YOU REJECT THEM.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.200
- NO.
- YES.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.900
YES, AND THAT WAY,
YOU NEVER HAVE TO SETTLE DOWN,

17:40.900 --> 17:43.833
AND EVERYONE CAN STILL
FEEL SORRY FOR POOR, LONELY YOU.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.900
- HEY, LOOK, I MAY NOT BE
THE GREATEST CATCH IN THE WORLD,

17:45.900 --> 17:47.867
BUT I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD JUST SETTLE.

17:47.867 --> 17:51.333
- I'M NOT TELLING YOU
TO SETTLE, ROBERT.

17:51.333 --> 17:52.767
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY

17:52.767 --> 17:54.767
IF EVERY TIME YOU DISCOVER
A FLAW IN SOMEBODY,

17:54.767 --> 17:56.333
YOU GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE
BECAUSE THAT SOMEBODY ELSE

17:56.333 --> 17:58.233
IS GOING TO HAVE
HER OWN FLAWS.

17:58.233 --> 17:59.867
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

17:59.867 --> 18:02.133
- YOU ARE.

18:04.967 --> 18:06.500
- WHAT?

18:11.767 --> 18:14.600
DEBRA?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.767
MY DEBRA?

18:16.767 --> 18:20.033
THIS?

18:20.033 --> 18:23.300
- WELL, YEAH.
I THINK DEBRA'S PERFECT.

18:24.533 --> 18:27.500
- WELL,
YOU CAN'T HAVE HER.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.367
- WAIT A MINUTE.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WAIT A MINUTE?

18:31.533 --> 18:34.100
- I MEAN, THAT WAS--
THAT WAS SO SWEET,

18:34.100 --> 18:37.767
AND I WAS JUST
SO MEAN TO YOU,

18:37.767 --> 18:39.733
AND I'M NOT PERFECT.

18:39.733 --> 18:41.600
TELL HIM, RAY.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.100
- IS THIS A TRAP?

18:47.900 --> 18:51.267
- I MEAN, ROBERT--
ROBERT, YOU DON'T REALLY--

18:51.267 --> 18:53.600
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.867
WHAT I MEANT IS
THAT YOU'RE PERFECT FOR HIM.

18:56.867 --> 19:00.167
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.567
- BUT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.167
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.567
WHY'D YOU SAY THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:04.567 --> 19:05.700
I HAD A ROUGH DAY.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.167
- YEAH, WELL,
I'VE HAD ROUGH DAYS.

19:07.167 --> 19:08.933
I NEVER SAID
SHE WAS PERFECT.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.567
- SO SHE'S NOT PERFECT,
OKAY?

19:10.567 --> 19:11.767
- SO NOW YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S PERFECT?

19:11.767 --> 19:13.467
- NO.

19:13.467 --> 19:15.033
- YOU SEE THAT THERE'S LOTS
OF THINGS WRONG WITH HER NOW.

19:15.033 --> 19:16.367
- YES!
- LIKE WHAT?

19:16.367 --> 19:18.100
- I DON'T KNOW!
- I'M CURIOUS. TELL ME!

19:18.100 --> 19:19.400
- TELL YOU WHAT?

19:19.400 --> 19:20.867
- TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER.

19:20.867 --> 19:22.400
I'M VERY CURIOUS.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.233
- ALL RIGHT!
SHE CAN BE MOODY AND CRITICAL.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.633
- OH, WE ALL SAY THAT ONE.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.500
- LOOK, YOU ASKED ME,
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.600
SHE CAN BE HORRIBLE!
- OKAY.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.933
- AND HERE'S ANOTHER THING:
SHE HAS ONE OF THOSE EYES

19:33.933 --> 19:36.500
THAT ARE A LITTLE HIGHER
THAN THE OTHER.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.500
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
- HEY!

19:39.500 --> 19:41.800
- AND I USUALLY--I USUALLY
DON'T CARE ABOUT POSTURE,

19:41.800 --> 19:43.100
BUT SHE'S ALL--

19:43.100 --> 19:45.433
- ALL RIGHT!
KNOCK IT OFF!

19:45.433 --> 19:49.367
- ALL RIGHT?
ARE YOU HAPPY, RAYMOND?

19:49.367 --> 19:51.700
ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT ABOUT HER.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.200
- WELL, NOW SHE
DOESN'T SOUND SO GOOD.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.533
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT HER.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.567
- YOU BETTER STOP TALKING
IF YOU WANT YOUR DINNER.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.500
- AND ANOTHER THING--
- ALL RIGHT.

20:08.067 --> 20:10.067
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.800
I JUST MEANT
THAT RAY WAS LUCKY

20:11.800 --> 20:14.500
IN THE FACT THAT HE FOUND
THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE

20:14.500 --> 20:17.133
FOR HIM.

20:17.133 --> 20:20.200
I'M JUST HOPING
TO BE THAT LUCKY.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.067
- YOU WILL BE, ROBERT.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.867
- THANKS.

20:25.867 --> 20:27.833
THANKS, GUYS.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.400
- SEE YOU LATER.
- OKAY.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.967
HE'S RIGHT.

20:35.967 --> 20:40.767
YOU'RE VERY, VERY LUCKY.

20:40.767 --> 20:42.700
- LUCKY.

20:55.133 --> 20:58.300
WONDER IF THAT WAS
THE NAME OF THIS HORSE.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.967
- HEY, MA.
- HI, ROBBIE.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.400
- DID YOU WANT SOMETHING?

21:08.400 --> 21:11.233
- YES. SIT DOWN, DEAR.
HAVE A SEAT.

21:22.633 --> 21:25.600
NOW, I KNOW YESTERDAY MIGHT HAVE
BEEN A LITTLE ROUGH ON YOU,

21:25.600 --> 21:28.267
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
NO MATTER WHAT WAS SAID,

21:28.267 --> 21:32.467
YOU'RE MY BOY,
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY BOY.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.300
AND I LOVE YOU.

21:36.233 --> 21:39.367
- THANKS, MA.
- OKAY, SWEETIE.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.400
- MA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:46.400 --> 21:49.200
- [chuckles]
NUMBER 19 ON THE LIST.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.000
YOUR LITTLE EAR HAIRS.
