WEBVTT

00:00.769 --> 00:02.180
The Carmichael Show is taped

00:02.181 --> 00:03.903
in front of a live studio audience.

00:06.106 --> 00:08.141
Hey, uh, where did we get this table from?

00:08.143 --> 00:10.811
Fell off the back of a truck.

00:10.812 --> 00:12.446
Wait a minute, you stole this?

00:12.447 --> 00:13.614
No, I didn't steal it.

00:13.615 --> 00:16.350
It actually fell off the back of a truck.

00:16.351 --> 00:18.652
Almost killed me and your daddy.

00:18.653 --> 00:21.322
Mm-hmm. We agreed not to
sue if they let us keep it.

00:21.323 --> 00:23.290
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why
didn't y'all just sue him?

00:23.291 --> 00:24.692
You would have got way more.

00:24.693 --> 00:26.927
Well, we were young and dumb, Bobby.

00:26.928 --> 00:28.596
Hey, everyone.

00:28.597 --> 00:31.465
Yeah, hey, everybody. So, uh,

00:31.466 --> 00:33.934
why's the good table
out? What's going on here?

00:33.935 --> 00:36.203
- What are you two doing here?
- No, no, no, no...

00:36.204 --> 00:37.838
you answer my question first.

00:37.839 --> 00:39.807
Are you planning a fancy dinner without me?

00:39.808 --> 00:41.841
Yes.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.478
Now you answer my question.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.146
Why are you here?

00:46.147 --> 00:47.681
Well, I thought we were
going to the movies,

00:47.682 --> 00:49.416
but then Jerrod saw Bobby's car,

00:49.417 --> 00:52.319
and I'm not saying he's jealous, but...

00:52.320 --> 00:53.587
here we are.

00:53.588 --> 00:55.122
Well, what's going on here,

00:55.123 --> 00:56.991
for real? Bobby, you know
you can't keep a secret.

00:56.992 --> 00:58.192
Tell me... what's up?

00:58.193 --> 01:00.794
- Reverend Carlson coming over.
- Oh, Bobby.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.229
The reverend's coming over?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.831
- You know I love the reverend.
- No, no,

01:03.832 --> 01:06.901
I do not want you challenging
the reverend the way you do.

01:06.902 --> 01:09.303
You know, you're the same
kid who shut down Bible study

01:09.304 --> 01:12.106
with your theory of evolution.

01:12.107 --> 01:15.676
You realize it's not just my theory, right?

01:15.677 --> 01:17.645
Okay, uh, who's this reverend?

01:17.646 --> 01:19.079
He's been the reverend at my church

01:19.080 --> 01:20.981
since before these boys were born. He has

01:20.982 --> 01:23.317
stuck with us through thick and thin.

01:23.318 --> 01:24.652
Oh, he's a good man.

01:24.653 --> 01:26.954
A bit of a drinker.

01:26.955 --> 01:30.323
But in a good way. You
know, like Ted Kennedy.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.827
Reverend Carlson marched with Dr. King.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.062
Yeah, okay,

01:35.063 --> 01:37.431
but, Ma, a lot of people
marched with Dr. King.

01:37.432 --> 01:41.067
Yeah, but he was in the
VIP. He had backstage passes.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.805
Now listen,

01:44.806 --> 01:46.774
the reverend is gonna be here in a moment.

01:46.775 --> 01:48.642
Now, if you two are gonna stay for dinner,

01:48.643 --> 01:52.546
listen up. My reputation at
the church is on the line,

01:52.547 --> 01:54.615
so I want you all

01:54.616 --> 01:57.017
to keep your sins to yourselves.

01:57.018 --> 01:58.919
Be clear with us, Ma...

01:58.920 --> 02:00.754
what are our sins, exactly?

02:00.755 --> 02:04.325
Well, yours is standing right next to you.

02:04.326 --> 02:05.993
It's called living in sin.

02:05.994 --> 02:07.027
It's in the title.

02:07.028 --> 02:09.697
Oh. No offense, baby.

02:09.698 --> 02:11.532
Nah. I'm a sin, I'm naughty.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.766
I'm just trying to get through this.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.505
Wait, we are embarrassing,
but Bobby's here?

02:18.506 --> 02:20.541
Bobby lives with his ex-wife
and her new boyfriend.

02:20.542 --> 02:22.775
Hey, hey, he got a name, Jerrod.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.981
Which I want you to keep to yourself.

02:26.982 --> 02:29.249
Do not say anything about your divorce

02:29.250 --> 02:30.517
in front of the reverend.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.686
So you want all of us
to lie to the reverend?

02:32.687 --> 02:33.988
No. Not lie.

02:33.989 --> 02:36.090
Just omit...

02:36.091 --> 02:38.258
all the bad truths.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.461
Well, you know what I say...
nothing wrong with a little lie,

02:40.462 --> 02:42.329
long as it makes you sound more impressive.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.298
- Joe.
- Well, I mean, I get tired

02:44.299 --> 02:45.833
of telling people I'm a truck driver.

02:45.834 --> 02:49.168
Once in a while I say I'm a airplane pilot.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.306
All right, Dad, let me
keep it real with you, okay?

02:52.307 --> 02:54.074
You don't have a voice
to be no airline pilot.

02:54.075 --> 02:55.309
What are you talking about?

02:55.310 --> 02:57.277
Feel free to move about the cabin.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.078
That's not comforting to you?

03:00.648 --> 03:03.684
Joe, no lying to the reverend.

03:03.685 --> 03:05.918
Fine. I won't lie.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.555
That's a lie. I'm gonna lie.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.093
Okay, it sounds like there's,
like, a lot of pressure

03:13.094 --> 03:15.062
- having dinner with the reverend.
- No, no pressure at all.

03:15.063 --> 03:16.997
Just relax and just be yourself, okay?

03:16.998 --> 03:18.899
Yeah, we love you for you, Maxine.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.636
Okay, I can't tell if
you're lying to me or not.

03:22.637 --> 03:25.771
I'm pretty good, right?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.377
Oh, my goodness, he's here!

03:30.378 --> 03:32.646
Now, Jerrod, no living in sin.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.082
Joe, no lying. And-and, Bobby,

03:35.083 --> 03:36.717
no facts about your life at all,

03:36.718 --> 03:38.986
because they're all sad.

03:38.987 --> 03:41.855
Sad, sad, sad.

03:41.856 --> 03:43.824
Okay, wait, is there...

03:43.825 --> 03:45.392
is there anything that I need to do?

03:45.393 --> 03:48.195
Well, uh, just don't go
around telling everybody

03:48.196 --> 03:51.231
that you're pro-choice and all that.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.667
Cynthia, you and I have
never even discussed that.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.201
But you are, aren't you?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.370
Uh-huh.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.909
Oh, Reverend Carlson!

04:01.910 --> 04:04.478
Ah, the Carmichaels.

04:04.479 --> 04:07.014
Uh, they had a two-for-one special.

04:07.015 --> 04:09.717
God saves those who save.

04:09.718 --> 04:12.553
Yes, he does. Yes, he does.

04:12.554 --> 04:14.188
Hey, I want you to meet
my girlfriend, Maxine.

04:14.189 --> 04:15.756
- Oh, pleasure.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:15.757 --> 04:18.425
We live together.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.927
Oh, come on.

04:19.928 --> 04:22.196
- You didn't know I was gonna do that?
- Oh!

04:40.538 --> 04:42.566
You know what the Bible doesn't tell you?

04:42.567 --> 04:45.405
Moses didn't really part the Red Sea.

04:45.406 --> 04:46.406
That's right.

04:46.407 --> 04:48.108
God caused that sea to part

04:48.109 --> 04:51.777
every day at 5:30 p.m. Bible time.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.949
Joses was just lucky he
got there when he did.

04:59.019 --> 05:00.754
Did he just say Joses?

05:00.755 --> 05:03.088
That was really your only
problem with that story?

05:04.758 --> 05:06.226
More wine, dear.

05:06.227 --> 05:08.194
- Oh, no, thanks.
- No, no, I mean for me.

05:08.195 --> 05:10.997
Oh.

05:10.998 --> 05:13.633
Oh, keep it going. Keep
it going, all the way up.

05:13.634 --> 05:16.168
Give me that meniscus.

05:17.470 --> 05:20.472
I want my glass to look
like an infinity pool.

05:25.378 --> 05:26.980
Here we are.

05:26.981 --> 05:30.483
- Oh, that looks lovely.
- Thank you.

05:30.484 --> 05:31.818
So, Joe,

05:31.819 --> 05:33.620
uh, how's the trucking business going?

05:33.621 --> 05:34.988
Pretty good.

05:34.989 --> 05:37.223
In fact, the president called me personally

05:37.224 --> 05:38.725
and asked me to deliver this year's

05:38.726 --> 05:41.494
White House Christmas tree.

05:41.495 --> 05:43.063
What?!

05:43.064 --> 05:45.265
And, Bobby, how's your lovely wife?

05:45.266 --> 05:47.967
Uh...

05:47.968 --> 05:50.202
I mean, she's happier than she's ever been.

05:53.706 --> 05:56.042
Reverend, would you do the blessing?

05:56.043 --> 05:59.913
Mm. Of course.

05:59.914 --> 06:02.649
Dear Heavenly Father, bless this sustenance

06:02.650 --> 06:05.418
that has been prepared
by divinely guided hands.

06:05.419 --> 06:08.288
And allow us to have nourishment

06:08.289 --> 06:12.225
for our bodies and souls so
that we may serve you better.

06:12.226 --> 06:13.660
Let us all say amen.

06:13.661 --> 06:15.093
Amen.

06:16.663 --> 06:19.566
I said, let us all say...

06:19.567 --> 06:21.201
amen.

06:21.202 --> 06:23.036
Amen.

06:23.037 --> 06:25.705
Maxine, dear?

06:25.706 --> 06:28.475
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought...
I thought it would be

06:28.476 --> 06:31.010
more respectful not to join
in since I'm not Christian.

06:31.011 --> 06:32.811
Amen.

06:36.116 --> 06:38.551
Wow, this looks good.

06:38.552 --> 06:40.320
Not Christian?

06:40.321 --> 06:41.688
Of course she's Christian.

06:41.689 --> 06:44.491
What else can she be?

06:44.492 --> 06:47.327
I don't know. There are about
other five major religions.

06:47.328 --> 06:50.096
Not in North Carolina, there aren't.

06:50.097 --> 06:51.764
Okay, I-I'm Jewish.

06:51.765 --> 06:53.133
Well, technically half-Jewish.

06:53.134 --> 06:55.768
She's a Jew?

06:55.769 --> 06:58.037
You're a Jew?

06:58.038 --> 07:00.706
- She's a Jew, Joe.
- Okay, can we...

07:01.975 --> 07:03.376
Will you stop saying "Jew" like that?

07:03.377 --> 07:04.911
You're making it sound like a racial slur.

07:04.912 --> 07:06.946
Jesus was a Jew.

07:06.947 --> 07:10.350
Then again, look how that turned out.

07:10.351 --> 07:12.852
You know what sounds like a slur? Mexican.

07:12.853 --> 07:14.686
It's not, but it sounds like one.

07:15.722 --> 07:16.923
You can call them that to they face.

07:16.924 --> 07:18.625
They don't even mind.

07:18.626 --> 07:20.593
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad, I
don't... that's not true.

07:20.594 --> 07:21.661
I think they mind a little.

07:21.662 --> 07:22.929
You know, I think he meant Puerto Rican.

07:22.930 --> 07:24.864
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:24.865 --> 07:26.666
Just the other day down
at the job, I saw a Mexican

07:26.667 --> 07:29.669
I wanted to talk to, so I said,
"Hey, Mexican. Come over here,

07:29.670 --> 07:31.237
I want to talk to you about something."

07:31.238 --> 07:33.206
And you know what he did?

07:33.207 --> 07:35.108
He said, "Okay" and he
came over and talked to me.

07:35.109 --> 07:36.843
Just like that.

07:36.844 --> 07:39.412
Jerrod, when were you gonna tell me

07:39.413 --> 07:41.514
that Maxine isn't a Christian?

07:41.515 --> 07:43.082
Why is that something I need to tell you?

07:43.083 --> 07:44.817
I've been serving that
girl pork for months.

07:44.818 --> 07:47.387
You know how bad I feel?

07:47.388 --> 07:49.622
No, it's okay, Joe, I'm non-practicing.

07:49.623 --> 07:51.124
I guess if you had to label it, I would say

07:51.125 --> 07:52.959
I'm more agnostic than anything.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.229
Uh, is that the one with the
crystals or the Tom Cruise one?

07:56.230 --> 07:58.831
Agnostic?

07:58.832 --> 08:02.035
What do you have against
organized religion?

08:02.036 --> 08:04.436
Remember when you were worried
about me ruining dinner?

08:06.206 --> 08:08.041
Okay, I don't have
anything against religion

08:08.042 --> 08:11.578
as a concept. There are
many great values to take

08:11.579 --> 08:13.146
from all religions.

08:13.147 --> 08:15.715
It's the people who corrupt
it that I have a problem with.

08:15.716 --> 08:17.684
What people?

08:17.685 --> 08:19.319
Oh,

08:19.320 --> 08:21.221
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about people who,

08:21.222 --> 08:24.490
you know, start wars over religion, who...

08:24.491 --> 08:27.493
who say love thy neighbor
and then turn around

08:27.494 --> 08:29.728
and deny him his basic rights.

08:30.897 --> 08:34.433
You know, Reverend, um...

08:34.434 --> 08:38.403
Joe is gonna be an airline pilot.

08:52.852 --> 08:54.354
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:54.355 --> 08:55.888
You got up early today.

08:55.889 --> 08:58.458
Yeah. I needed to clear my head.

08:58.459 --> 09:00.093
Dinner got so weird last night.

09:00.094 --> 09:03.495
I know, you being a Jew
really freaked everybody out.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.666
It was like 1940s Germany all over again.

09:10.604 --> 09:12.537
You'd better hope that's not the gestapo.

09:17.777 --> 09:20.846
Oh, God, Maxine, it's worse.

09:22.148 --> 09:23.850
Jerrod, you're coming to church.

09:23.851 --> 09:25.118
Hey, Rod.

09:25.119 --> 09:27.287
Hey. No, I'm not going to church.

09:27.288 --> 09:28.588
Hey, Maxine.

09:28.589 --> 09:30.189
You really shut things down last night.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.058
Well, I for one

09:32.059 --> 09:34.560
am happy we had the dinner we had.

09:34.561 --> 09:36.996
Because it made me realize the importance

09:36.997 --> 09:39.974
of us getting you back on a righteous path.

09:39.975 --> 09:41.501
I don't care what you say,
I'm not going to church

09:41.502 --> 09:43.069
with you. It's Netflix Sunday.

09:43.070 --> 09:45.938
Sunday is the Lord's Day, Jerrod,

09:45.939 --> 09:47.707
and somewhere along the line

09:47.708 --> 09:49.609
it seems you have forgotten that.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.144
Now, Maxine,

09:51.145 --> 09:53.146
do you believe in God or not?

09:53.147 --> 09:54.847
Yes, I believe in a god.

09:54.848 --> 09:56.849
Just not the same one
that you're picturing.

09:56.850 --> 10:00.753
My God looks like that guy
from the Allstate commercials.

10:00.754 --> 10:02.689
He's got a confident
voice and thick eyebrows.

10:02.690 --> 10:06.491
See, that's how I know I'm in good hands.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.729
It just sounds too flighty to me.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.165
It seems like you are afraid

10:12.166 --> 10:14.634
to-to commit to a belief.

10:14.635 --> 10:16.402
So let me get this straight...
your problem with Maxine

10:16.403 --> 10:19.072
being agnostic is that she's
afraid to commit to a belief?

10:19.073 --> 10:21.641
- Yes, that's my problem, Jerrod.
- Okay, so you're saying

10:21.642 --> 10:24.677
that you'd be cool with Maxine
if she were, like, a Muslim?

10:24.678 --> 10:27.947
Oh, Joe, what is happening?

10:27.948 --> 10:30.516
She's agnostic, she's a-a Jew,

10:30.517 --> 10:34.020
a Muslim? I mean, I just
can't keep track of it anymore.

10:34.021 --> 10:36.589
I knew she was a Muslim.

10:36.590 --> 10:39.892
She wears too many scarves not to be.

10:39.893 --> 10:41.994
What? No, no, no.

10:41.995 --> 10:44.330
I'm not Muslim. And also
I don't think scarves

10:44.331 --> 10:46.165
is how you tell if someone's Muslim.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.300
But they do love scarves, though.

10:47.301 --> 10:48.901
- They do, they do.
- No, no, no, no.

10:48.902 --> 10:50.870
Okay, look, the point I was trying to make

10:50.871 --> 10:52.939
is that Muslims are just as devout as you,

10:52.940 --> 10:54.173
and if Maxine were a Muslim,

10:54.174 --> 10:55.608
you would still have a problem with it.

10:55.609 --> 10:57.043
Oh, now, you just pump
the brakes right there,

10:57.044 --> 10:59.879
because I am as devout as any Muslim.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.048
Muslims pray, like, five times a day.

11:02.049 --> 11:04.484
- Five times a day?
- Mm-hmm.

11:04.485 --> 11:06.786
How did Ali have time to fight?

11:11.290 --> 11:14.694
I pray more than five times a day

11:14.695 --> 11:16.929
if you count the little prayers.

11:16.930 --> 11:18.765
- What-what little prayers?
- Yes,

11:18.766 --> 11:20.099
little prayers.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.868
Like, you're in a parking lot

11:21.869 --> 11:23.169
and you're looking for a spot.

11:23.170 --> 11:26.339
You can't find it, you say a little prayer.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.775
Just so we're clear, I do have beliefs.

11:28.776 --> 11:31.577
They're just more spiritual than religious.

11:31.578 --> 11:34.614
Oh, okay. There she goes again,

11:34.615 --> 11:38.151
afraid to commit to an answer.

11:38.152 --> 11:41.120
Okay, no, that is my answer.

11:41.121 --> 11:43.089
I believe what you put
out into the universe

11:43.090 --> 11:44.924
is what comes back to you.

11:44.925 --> 11:49.028
That's not a religion.
That's a fortune cookie.

11:49.029 --> 11:51.998
Okay...

11:51.999 --> 11:55.468
Don't you believe that
everything is interconnected?

11:55.469 --> 11:57.770
I mean, we're all just made
up of the same things...

11:57.771 --> 11:59.672
you, me, the sky,

11:59.673 --> 12:01.007
this chair.

12:01.008 --> 12:03.676
We're all just energy and space dust,

12:03.677 --> 12:05.912
just mixing around, swirling together

12:05.913 --> 12:08.648
inside of a giant cup.

12:08.649 --> 12:11.517
I'm sorry, what? A giant cup? Th...

12:11.518 --> 12:13.786
That's what you believe?
You believe in a giant cup?

12:13.787 --> 12:15.188
No. Okay.

12:15.189 --> 12:16.289
Well, I've never had to articulate

12:16.290 --> 12:17.356
what I believe before.

12:17.357 --> 12:18.691
I've always just said I'm spiritual

12:18.692 --> 12:21.494
and then people stop asking questions.

12:21.495 --> 12:24.397
Well, in that case, she's spiritual,

12:24.398 --> 12:27.099
so stop asking questions.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.101
And what are you saying, Jerrod?

12:29.102 --> 12:33.372
Have you been converted
into a giant cup worshipper?

12:33.373 --> 12:36.943
- That's not what I meant.
- No. No, Ma.

12:36.944 --> 12:38.411
I'm still Christian, all right?

12:38.412 --> 12:41.380
I still subscribe to those
beliefs. I still pray every day.

12:41.381 --> 12:42.815
Thank God for that.

12:42.816 --> 12:45.551
- Wait, you pray?
- Yeah, I pray.

12:45.552 --> 12:47.854
Well, don't you all know this already?

12:47.855 --> 12:50.690
I mean, have you not discussed this?

12:50.691 --> 12:53.192
- Wait, you pray every day?
- Yeah, every day.

12:53.193 --> 12:55.661
Me and your mama talked about
religion on our first date.

12:55.662 --> 12:58.331
That and Reaganomics.

12:58.332 --> 13:00.500
Yeah, I don't understand.

13:00.501 --> 13:02.902
Why didn't you tell me
how religious you were?

13:02.903 --> 13:05.338
I don't know.
'Cause it's personal, I guess.

13:05.339 --> 13:07.540
More personal than sharing deodorant?

13:07.541 --> 13:12.311
Look, it says, "Strong enough for a man."

13:12.312 --> 13:15.314
So what else haven't you two talked about?

13:15.315 --> 13:18.317
I mean, if this thing works
out and you get married,

13:18.318 --> 13:20.319
what, is she gonna make you wear a scarf

13:20.320 --> 13:22.420
and one of them little circle hats?

13:24.023 --> 13:25.958
And what about your kids?
What's gonna happen to them?

13:25.959 --> 13:28.294
Now, you know at some
point, they're gonna ask you

13:28.295 --> 13:30.830
big questions, like what
happens after we die.

13:30.831 --> 13:32.632
And you all need to be on the same page.

13:32.633 --> 13:36.568
- Is it gonna be heaven or that
big-ass cup in the sky? - Mm-hmm.

13:38.004 --> 13:40.373
Joe, what do you think? Do
you think that they rushed

13:40.374 --> 13:44.076
- into moving in together too fast?
- I don't know.

13:44.077 --> 13:46.045
How long a lease did you two sign here?

13:46.046 --> 13:48.781
Oh, no.

13:48.782 --> 13:51.517
They didn't even sign a lease.

13:51.518 --> 13:55.488
This is one of those
noncommittal things, just...

13:55.489 --> 13:58.990
month-to-month relationship.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.894
Come on, Joe.

14:01.895 --> 14:03.429
Let's go to church.

14:03.430 --> 14:07.433
'Cause we... we got a lot to pray for.

14:07.434 --> 14:10.001
Mmm.

14:12.738 --> 14:16.174
Even still, kind of nice of
'em to stop by on a Sunday.

14:21.031 --> 14:22.554
Why aren't I on the lease?

14:27.554 --> 14:31.325
Because it-it's not like I
can just go down to an office

14:31.326 --> 14:33.127
and sign a piece of paper.

14:33.128 --> 14:35.195
It's more complicated than that.

14:35.196 --> 14:39.099
No, I'm pretty sure
that's the exact process.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.068
Why didn't we think to put me on the lease?

14:41.069 --> 14:43.036
And why haven't we
talked about our beliefs?

14:43.037 --> 14:46.306
And what are you praying about every day?

14:46.307 --> 14:50.511
Mostly that we don't have
conversations like this.

14:50.512 --> 14:53.447
Well, what if we do get married one day?

14:53.448 --> 14:55.415
I don't want to do it in a church.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.184
And-and what...

14:57.185 --> 14:59.353
and what religion would our kids be?

14:59.354 --> 15:01.321
Christian, probably. But mostly

15:01.322 --> 15:05.425
'cause I want 'em wearing
little Jesus pieces like Kanye.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.561
No, you see, that's a problem,
because I want to encourage them

15:07.562 --> 15:09.263
to make their own choices.

15:09.264 --> 15:10.397
Make their own choices?

15:10.398 --> 15:12.366
Everybody knows children
are stupid, Maxine.

15:12.367 --> 15:13.934
Can't make their own choices.

15:13.935 --> 15:15.502
If I made my own religious
choice as a child,

15:15.503 --> 15:16.937
I'd be a Scientologist right now,

15:16.938 --> 15:18.572
and that's based solely off John Travolta's

15:18.573 --> 15:22.810
excellent performance in Pulp Fiction.

15:22.811 --> 15:24.444
You see, these are big life decisions,

15:24.445 --> 15:26.313
and we can't even agree on any of them.

15:26.314 --> 15:28.649
But why do we have to agree now, Maxine?

15:28.650 --> 15:30.951
Like, we don't have to
make those decisions.

15:30.952 --> 15:32.586
We're not married. We don't have any kids.

15:32.587 --> 15:35.722
Your name's not even on the lease.

15:35.723 --> 15:38.492
Which is... which is really
a stupid thing to say.

15:38.493 --> 15:40.794
I get that. It was a dumb thing to say.

15:40.795 --> 15:42.563
But what if your parents are right?

15:42.564 --> 15:44.031
What if we did rush into this,

15:44.032 --> 15:45.799
and you and I aren't meant to be together?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.301
"Meant to be to..."

15:47.302 --> 15:49.203
What are you talking
about, soul mates, Maxine?

15:49.204 --> 15:50.704
Soul mate's not a real thing.

15:50.705 --> 15:55.409
So you believe that there's
an all-powerful man in the sky

15:55.410 --> 15:57.144
that you can talk to,

15:57.145 --> 15:58.779
but you don't believe in the possibility

15:58.780 --> 16:00.747
that you and I are meant to be together?

16:00.748 --> 16:02.149
Exactly!

16:02.150 --> 16:03.784
But-but-but-but, Maxine,

16:03.785 --> 16:05.152
I think we're the best we could do

16:05.153 --> 16:06.520
within a 50-mile radius,

16:06.521 --> 16:08.641
and I don't think you can
ask for much more than that.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.826
Jerrod, I want... I want more than that.

16:12.827 --> 16:15.796
And you deserve more. And, you know what,

16:15.797 --> 16:18.398
Maxine...

16:18.399 --> 16:21.034
will you put your name on my lease?

16:21.035 --> 16:23.704
Wh-What? What...

16:23.705 --> 16:27.774
It was funny! It was funny!

16:27.775 --> 16:31.545
Religion is ruining my relationship.

16:31.546 --> 16:33.747
Or my parents are ruining my relationship.

16:33.748 --> 16:35.249
Look, something's ruining my relationship,

16:35.250 --> 16:37.751
and, for once, it's not me.

16:37.752 --> 16:39.987
Jerrod, let's start from the beginning.

16:39.988 --> 16:42.756
Okay. So, if I'm Christian

16:42.757 --> 16:44.691
and my girlfriend is agnostic-

16:44.692 --> 16:46.927
slash-kind of Jewish-

16:46.928 --> 16:49.429
slash-something about
a cup, I want to know,

16:49.430 --> 16:52.065
is that gonna cause problems down the line?

16:52.066 --> 16:53.300
Probably.

16:53.301 --> 16:55.869
But, then again, maybe not.

16:55.870 --> 16:59.473
You're really just checking
off all the boxes here, huh?

16:59.474 --> 17:02.075
Couples of any faith can have problems.

17:02.076 --> 17:04.978
What's important is that they're
both willing to work them out.

17:04.979 --> 17:07.247
Take your parents, for example.

17:07.248 --> 17:09.616
They had a rocky beginning
to their marriage.

17:09.617 --> 17:11.451
They figured it out.

17:11.452 --> 17:13.020
What? What rocky beginning?

17:13.021 --> 17:14.655
Ooh...

17:14.656 --> 17:16.156
Was that a secret?

17:17.525 --> 17:19.425
You wouldn't believe the amount of secrets

17:19.426 --> 17:20.928
people tell me in this job.

17:20.929 --> 17:25.398
I'm not even Catholic, and they
still feel a need to confess.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.867
Can you do me a favor and rewind back

17:26.867 --> 17:29.603
- to the whole parent problem thing?
- Well,

17:29.604 --> 17:32.806
when I was a young minister
and I was about your age,

17:32.807 --> 17:34.908
your parents came to me for guidance.

17:34.909 --> 17:36.576
Guidance for what?

17:36.577 --> 17:38.812
Well, your mother has always been devout,

17:38.813 --> 17:41.248
but your father hasn't
always been a believer.

17:41.249 --> 17:43.550
Even still, it's a little rocky.

17:43.551 --> 17:47.821
I clocked at least five
lies he told over dinner.

17:47.822 --> 17:50.290
You know, it's funny. The way
she comes after me and Maxine,

17:50.291 --> 17:52.292
you would think they
never had any problems.

17:52.293 --> 17:53.994
Oh, big problems.

17:53.995 --> 17:56.964
- Really?
- Mmm. Also,

17:56.965 --> 18:01.435
did you know your Aunt Lisa
was a lesbian for two years?

18:01.436 --> 18:03.503
That's why she drives a Subaru!

18:03.504 --> 18:05.539
Yeah.

18:05.540 --> 18:08.275
How dare you?

18:08.276 --> 18:09.509
Excuse me?

18:09.510 --> 18:11.144
Maxine, what is he talking about?

18:11.145 --> 18:12.913
I don't know. He just
told me to get in the car

18:12.914 --> 18:15.415
and said I would enjoy
what's about to happen.

18:15.416 --> 18:16.917
And you will.

18:16.918 --> 18:18.552
Please, have a seat, Maxine.

18:18.553 --> 18:21.121
So, after you two tried to bust
up me and Maxine's relationship,

18:21.122 --> 18:22.723
I went down to the reverend's office,

18:22.724 --> 18:24.491
and he had a few interesting things to say.

18:24.492 --> 18:27.294
And what did my reverend tell you?

18:27.295 --> 18:30.163
Well, he told me that when you
and Dad first met, he wasn't

18:30.164 --> 18:31.965
religious at all, and it
caused so many problems

18:31.966 --> 18:33.667
that you almost didn't get married.

18:33.668 --> 18:35.469
No way.

18:35.470 --> 18:39.272
Well, this is fun.

18:39.273 --> 18:41.541
Wait, you almost didn't get married to me?

18:41.542 --> 18:43.010
The reverend is a drinker.

18:43.011 --> 18:44.711
Well, how close to the wedding was this?

18:44.712 --> 18:45.812
I just didn't want you to have

18:45.813 --> 18:48.248
the same doubts and fears that I had.

18:48.249 --> 18:51.118
- Doubts? Fears? What-what doubts and fears?
- But, see, Ma,

18:51.119 --> 18:52.753
if you would've let those doubts and fears

18:52.754 --> 18:54.287
about your relationship ruin you,

18:54.288 --> 18:56.757
you wouldn't have the strong
thing that you have today.

18:56.758 --> 19:00.360
I just wanted to save you
from the problems that I had.

19:00.361 --> 19:02.596
What problems?

19:02.597 --> 19:06.233
See, your father is... religious now,

19:06.234 --> 19:09.903
but, when we met, oh, he
didn't believe in nothing,

19:09.904 --> 19:13.273
and it just drove my parents crazy.

19:13.274 --> 19:15.675
It put so much pressure on us

19:15.676 --> 19:18.378
that we began to question everything.

19:18.379 --> 19:20.981
Do you know how hard that is?

19:20.982 --> 19:23.283
Yes. Yes.

19:23.284 --> 19:26.019
Yeah, I know exactly how hard that is.

19:26.020 --> 19:27.788
Well, before you call me a hypocrite,

19:27.789 --> 19:29.189
I just want you to realize

19:29.190 --> 19:32.325
that I was just trying to protect you.

19:32.326 --> 19:37.264
You're trying to protect me from
a thing that you're doing to me?

19:37.265 --> 19:42.434
Jerrod, you will just never
understand a mother's love.

19:43.437 --> 19:47.407
Is that why you canceled
the rehearsal dinner?

19:47.408 --> 19:49.743
Hey, don't look around.
The man has questions.

19:49.744 --> 19:52.279
- Yes, the man has questions.
- Mm-hmm.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.481
It was a long time ago, Joe.

19:54.482 --> 19:56.650
Well, it feels very fresh to me.

19:56.651 --> 19:58.852
Joe, you didn't believe in anything.

19:58.853 --> 20:00.620
Well, you're not the only
one that had cold feet.

20:00.621 --> 20:02.789
Joe, you didn't have cold feet!

20:02.790 --> 20:07.360
I know, but I just didn't like
how one-sided this thing is.

20:07.361 --> 20:09.863
- This is the best date you've
ever taken me on. - Mm-hmm.

20:09.864 --> 20:12.132
And we got to get out of here, all right?

20:12.133 --> 20:13.357
Looks like these two got

20:13.358 --> 20:15.567
a lot to pray about.

20:21.938 --> 20:26.108
The key to meditation is
to focus on your breath.

20:26.109 --> 20:28.343
Do I get a mantra?

20:29.612 --> 20:31.614
'Cause I need a mantra.

20:31.615 --> 20:32.648
No mantra.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.451
My mantra is, "Am I doing this right?"

20:35.452 --> 20:38.320
Just don't think about anything.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.323
How can I not think? Everybody thinks.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.858
I'm sitting here thinking

20:42.859 --> 20:47.029
how stupid you are for
telling me not to think.

20:47.030 --> 20:50.264
Will you all shut up? I'm trying to sleep.

20:53.136 --> 20:55.370
God bless you.

20:58.307 --> 20:59.675
Maxine.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.343
You can't find an "amen"

21:01.344 --> 21:04.180
but you got a "God bless you" at the ready?

21:04.181 --> 21:11.240
