00:00.719 --> 00:01.806
I'm pregnant.

00:03.289 --> 00:05.811
You're... pregnant?

00:06.426 --> 00:08.776
With... a baby?

00:09.148 --> 00:11.329
Sorry, obviously that's... um.

00:11.331 --> 00:13.464
Uh, who...

00:13.797 --> 00:14.982
Uh, it's Adam.

00:14.983 --> 00:16.388
Oh, yeah, Adam. Adam.

00:16.389 --> 00:18.077
It was just a...
it was a one-time thing.

00:18.078 --> 00:19.542
How's... how's Adam doing?

00:20.308 --> 00:21.642
He's... he's good.

00:21.643 --> 00:24.077
Great, great.
That's... tell him I said hi.

00:25.967 --> 00:26.647
Um.

00:31.534 --> 00:34.711
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with that.

00:35.922 --> 00:36.904
I don't know.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.439
Why did you kiss me?

00:38.988 --> 00:40.753
I just... I wanted to.

00:42.273 --> 00:43.911
Before everything changed.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.383
I can't even...

00:53.589 --> 00:54.603
You know what?

00:56.709 --> 00:58.659
No. Forget it.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.433
Nope.

01:08.805 --> 01:09.904
Uh-uh.

Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:16.946 --> 01:19.880
Just a reminder that it's
still Haitian Heritage Month.

01:19.882 --> 01:21.182
So if you have a customer

01:21.184 --> 01:22.683
and you think they might be Haitian,

01:22.685 --> 01:25.152
feel free to offer them a sticker.

01:25.154 --> 01:28.589
Also, it is Mother's Day this weekend,

01:28.591 --> 01:31.144
and corporate says mothers
are in this year.

01:31.332 --> 01:33.226
So we're gonna be hitting that hard.

01:33.229 --> 01:35.830
Well, that's it for the
prepared announcements.

01:35.832 --> 01:37.765
Now I'll open it up to the room,

01:37.767 --> 01:40.684
in case anyone has something
they'd like to say.

01:42.505 --> 01:44.605
Maybe about Mother's Day?

01:46.340 --> 01:48.509
Well, my mom broke parole,
so I think that this

01:48.511 --> 01:49.630
- is gonna be the last...
- No, Cheyenne.

01:49.631 --> 01:50.921
Amy has the floor.

01:51.647 --> 01:52.421
Oh.

01:53.549 --> 01:54.709
Okay, I see.

01:55.318 --> 01:56.618
Hey guys, I'm pregnant.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.786
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:58.788 --> 02:00.221
- Wow.
- What?

02:00.223 --> 02:01.922
Oh, my God, out of nowhere.

02:01.924 --> 02:04.391
I know what you're thinking,
but I only told, like,

02:04.393 --> 02:06.407
three people, so this is not on me.

02:06.408 --> 02:07.495
It's fine. Everybody would have

02:07.497 --> 02:09.196
been able to tell soon anyway.

02:09.198 --> 02:12.032
I guessed last week when you plowed
through that pile of taquitos.

02:12.034 --> 02:13.767
It wasn't a pile of taquitos.

02:13.769 --> 02:16.170
It was a couple taquitos.

02:16.172 --> 02:17.855
Don't worry. I couldn't tell.

02:17.857 --> 02:19.707
- Did you know?
- No.

02:19.709 --> 02:22.600
Mm-mm. No, I didn't know until just now.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.880
That is wild, and wacky stuff.

02:25.882 --> 02:27.848
I did not know that.

02:27.850 --> 02:30.389
Well, I could tell already.
I compared the pictures.

02:30.390 --> 02:31.852
- What pictures...
- What pictures?

02:31.854 --> 02:34.288
Oh! That explains why
you didn't wanna come

02:34.290 --> 02:36.323
on my "Gossip Girl" bar crawl.

02:36.325 --> 02:37.825
Uh-huh. That was why.

02:37.827 --> 02:39.560
We have a lot of work
to do, so let's just

02:39.562 --> 02:41.228
burn through all of this.
Amy is pregnant.

02:41.230 --> 02:43.264
The baby is Adam's.
I was the first to know

02:43.266 --> 02:45.466
because I am her best friend,
and, Justine, no one went

02:45.468 --> 02:48.269
to your bar crawl because you
are unpleasant to be around.

02:48.271 --> 02:49.737
Unpleasant in bed.

02:51.073 --> 02:52.339
- Lame.
- I'm gonna give it to her.

02:52.341 --> 02:53.774
- Nice one.
- Thank you.

Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.
This weekend is Mother's Day.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.497
I don't know your mother,
but given what women

03:06.498 --> 03:07.855
have gone through this past year I think

03:07.857 --> 03:10.891
it's pretty safe to say, she needs this.

03:12.328 --> 03:14.042
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:14.513 --> 03:18.132
So, um, we should probably talk.

03:18.134 --> 03:19.533
Honestly, it's fine.

03:19.535 --> 03:21.468
I'm all good, really.
Nothing to talk about.

03:21.992 --> 03:23.320
Okay.

03:23.322 --> 03:26.941
Um, but, you know,
if we were gonna talk,

03:26.943 --> 03:28.642
I might say something like,

03:28.644 --> 03:32.379
"Ah, I was in a weird
place emotionally and..."

03:32.381 --> 03:34.014
But we're not gonna talk, right?

03:34.016 --> 03:35.398
So no need to do this.

03:37.887 --> 03:39.353
There, that looks right.

03:39.355 --> 03:41.388
I'm gonna go help Kelly.

03:46.430 --> 03:47.212
Hey, you.

03:48.297 --> 03:51.031
And something else
you might want to know is,

03:51.033 --> 03:53.767
Amy's pregnant!

03:54.255 --> 03:57.944
<i>Um, "quarterly reports" really mainly
just refers to the financials.</i>

03:57.945 --> 03:59.553
<i>I don't know who Amy is.</i>

03:59.554 --> 04:01.342
- The floor manager.
- I'm her best friend.

04:01.344 --> 04:02.710
- So.
<i>- Okay.</i>

04:02.712 --> 04:04.211
<i>Uh, few things on our end:</i>

04:04.213 --> 04:05.916

04:05.917 --> 04:07.713

04:07.714 --> 04:09.900
<i>and with your story of
rebuilding after the tornado,</i>

04:09.902 --> 04:11.584
<i>you guys are on the short list.</i>

04:12.054 --> 04:16.055
Oh. So, the CEO may come to this store

04:16.226 --> 04:18.375
that we're in right now?

04:18.377 --> 04:20.361
That's... interesting.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.020
If he needs a place to stay,
he can have my master bedroom.

04:24.021 --> 04:25.963
Jerusha and I could share
Timur's trundle bed.

04:25.964 --> 04:26.875
My place is quieter.

04:26.876 --> 04:28.067
Do you know what kind
of shampoo he uses?

04:28.068 --> 04:30.003
- I usually make my own.
<i>- My guess is</i>

04:30.006 --> 04:32.406
<i>that he would stay at
a hotel, but for now,</i>

04:32.408 --> 04:34.102
<i>if you could send us a
photo of your team,</i>

04:34.103 --> 04:35.602
<i>that would help with
promotional materials.</i>

04:35.604 --> 04:37.304

Attention Cloud 9 shoppers,
we have a bit of an emergency...

04:42.662 --> 04:43.994
Garrett! Garrett! We need
to make an announcement.

04:43.996 --> 04:45.529
I'm in the middle of
something right now.

04:45.531 --> 04:46.964
This is urgent! Attention, employees.

04:46.966 --> 04:48.093
We need you to assemble
in the front of the store

04:48.094 --> 04:49.756
for a group photo in ten minutes.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.349
Give me that.

04:50.350 --> 04:51.813
And look sharp!

04:51.814 --> 04:54.622
We... no! We have a chance to have CEO,

04:54.624 --> 04:56.789
Neil Penderson, in our store!

04:56.790 --> 04:58.516
This is not a prank.

04:58.517 --> 05:00.276
Neil! Penderson!

05:02.129 --> 05:04.332
As I was saying,
there's a missing child.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.721
His name is Caden. He has brown hair,

05:06.722 --> 05:08.521
is eight years old,
and is wearing overalls.

05:08.522 --> 05:10.868
So, uh, I guess those two things.

05:10.869 --> 05:12.409
Group photo. Missing kid.

05:13.439 --> 05:14.379
Hey, yo, Amy!

05:14.574 --> 05:16.276
Heard you got a baby
all up in them guts.

05:16.277 --> 05:18.202
- Yeah, congrats.
- Thank you.

05:18.203 --> 05:20.121
Mad props on not getting scooped out.

05:20.122 --> 05:22.700
Choose life y'all, what's up?

05:22.702 --> 05:23.528
Okay.

05:23.529 --> 05:24.895
We brought you some of Harmonica's

05:24.896 --> 05:27.120
old baby stuff we were
gonna give to Goodwill.

05:27.121 --> 05:28.907
Then we were like, why deal
with the middle man

05:28.908 --> 05:30.958
when we can just do the
charity right onto you?

05:30.959 --> 05:33.079
Oh, okay. Thank you.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.782
But I'm not a charity case.

05:34.783 --> 05:37.214
Oh, there's some good stuff in here.

05:37.216 --> 05:38.879
Oh, that baby. That's a good baby.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.932
Oh, it's clean.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.702
- It's clean.
- Oh!

05:41.704 --> 05:43.638
- Look, so cute.
- Aw, that's sweet.

05:43.639 --> 05:45.408
Little bitch. Oh.

05:45.409 --> 05:47.241
But what if it's a boy then?

05:47.242 --> 05:48.923
It's like a pretty funny slam on him.

05:48.924 --> 05:50.727

Oh, I wish that you could, Sandra,

06:09.330 --> 06:11.448
but somebody's got to take the picture.

06:11.450 --> 06:12.630
Maybe next year.

06:12.631 --> 06:14.607
Okay, it's just that I was the
one who took it last year

06:14.608 --> 06:15.884
and the year before that.

06:16.064 --> 06:18.614
- Did you change for this?
- I want to shine.

06:18.930 --> 06:20.318
Is it a crime to shine?

- Okay, Heather.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.078
Sweetie, get some self-esteem.

06:26.079 --> 06:28.236
Come up to the front. Amanda, way back.

than flattering.

06:35.624 --> 06:37.802
Oh, how big of a smile do you want?

06:38.076 --> 06:40.605
It hurts a little, but I can
show all of my teeth.

06:40.606 --> 06:41.773
Let's go with all the teeth.

06:41.774 --> 06:44.384

06:46.431 --> 06:47.000

06:50.689 --> 06:53.023
Okay, everyone put your
arms around each other.

06:53.025 --> 06:54.525
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:54.527 --> 06:57.432
Jonah, both arms.
Pregnancy's not contagious.

06:57.433 --> 06:59.112
Have you two never taken a picture?

06:59.113 --> 07:00.161

07:00.163 --> 07:01.905
Okay, we're ready! Let's do this!

07:01.906 --> 07:03.273

07:03.274 --> 07:05.202
Okay, everyone. Big smiles.

07:05.204 --> 07:06.998
There's a spot open in the middle.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.486
I could set a timer

07:08.487 --> 07:10.841
- and run in and...
- Nope! I got it!

07:12.375 --> 07:13.514
Oh, okay.

07:14.279 --> 07:15.552
I guess that works too.

07:15.943 --> 07:17.058
Okay, here we go.

07:19.855 --> 07:22.598
That is a group photo. Of our group.

07:23.169 --> 07:26.402
Yeah, doesn't exactly scream "CEO."

07:26.957 --> 07:28.790
- It seems fine to me.
- Exactly.

07:28.792 --> 07:31.459
It's just fine. That's a
good way of putting it.

07:31.461 --> 07:33.294
- That's not what I meant.
- You know what?

07:33.296 --> 07:35.013
I just don't feel anything
when I look at it.

07:35.015 --> 07:37.465
I want to see tornado survivors.

07:37.467 --> 07:40.218
Right! Like on "CNN Heroes,"

07:40.220 --> 07:42.470
you get a sense of the struggle.

07:42.472 --> 07:44.472
This doesn't feel like "CNN Heroes."

07:44.474 --> 07:48.059
Well, this is a still image,
and that's a television show.

07:48.061 --> 07:49.193
You know, I agree with Garrett.

07:49.195 --> 07:50.528
We should be doing a TV show.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.480
- Not what I said.
- Oh, my God.

07:52.482 --> 07:55.700
I bet none of the other
stores are doing a TV show.

07:55.702 --> 07:58.403
- That seems excessive.
- Excess leads to success.

07:58.405 --> 08:01.039
- Well, that rhymes.
- Well, drop your concerns,

08:01.041 --> 08:02.884
Ken Burns. Let's do this!

08:03.827 --> 08:04.624
Nice.

08:08.381 --> 08:09.265
Oh, hey, Amy.

08:09.429 --> 08:10.929
Did you drop that $20 bill?

08:11.475 --> 08:13.501
- Uh, nope, that's not mine.
- Oh.

08:13.503 --> 08:16.504
Well, I mean, you saw it
first, so finders keepers.

08:16.506 --> 08:18.840
No, I didn't. You found it.

08:18.842 --> 08:20.288
Why don't you just keep it.

08:21.061 --> 08:24.012
Mateo, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

08:24.014 --> 08:25.513
But I don't really need handouts.

08:25.515 --> 08:28.399
Handouts? I don't even know
what you're talking about.

08:28.401 --> 08:30.018
Someone dropped that there.
I don't know who.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.519
Oh, damn. Lucky day!

08:31.521 --> 08:33.738
- No, that's mine!
- What? No, it's mine now.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.356
- It's mine! It's mine!
- I just found it. It's mine.

08:35.357 --> 08:36.857
I put it there for Amy to find, Bo.

08:36.860 --> 08:38.025
Amy doesn't need charity.

08:39.446 --> 08:41.361
- I licked it! It's mine.
- No, I'll lick it.

08:48.922 --> 08:50.433
Where did that come from?

08:50.629 --> 08:52.514
I just wanted to kiss you.

08:53.293 --> 08:54.937
I might do it again sometime.

08:55.545 --> 08:57.420
I'll considered myself warned.

08:57.661 --> 08:58.685
Excuse me.

08:59.049 --> 09:00.598
Where can I find the dog food?

09:00.600 --> 09:03.750
- Oh, I'll show you.
- We'll show you together.

09:04.554 --> 09:05.329
Hm.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.280
Oh, um, th... we're...

09:10.610 --> 09:11.394
Okay.

09:13.729 --> 09:16.314
Cheyenne, tell us what you remember
about the day the tornado hit.

09:16.361 --> 09:16.981
Um.

09:16.983 --> 09:20.329
Okay, I remember I had
Chipotle for breakfast.

09:20.904 --> 09:22.787
And the guy who made my burrito

09:22.789 --> 09:25.623
was like really creepy,
but kind of in a hot way.

09:25.625 --> 09:26.657
He was like,

09:26.964 --> 09:28.667
"What kind of protein do you want?"

09:28.668 --> 09:31.579
And I was like, "Carnitas."

09:31.581 --> 09:33.608
No, more... what was it like here?

09:33.786 --> 09:35.075
At work. In the store.

09:35.802 --> 09:38.378
Did you think you were going to die?

09:38.494 --> 09:39.507
Yeah, totally.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.257
Could you say that
as a complete sentence?

09:43.259 --> 09:44.322
Uh, sure.

09:44.677 --> 09:47.261
I thought I was gonna die.

09:47.263 --> 09:49.013
Cheyenne, we're getting nothing.

09:49.015 --> 09:52.850
Okay? If you thought you were
gonna die, maybe act like it.

09:53.209 --> 09:56.270
Oh, okay, yeah,
I can act like that, okay.

09:57.857 --> 10:01.109
I remember coming...

10:01.111 --> 10:02.527
Sorry.

10:02.854 --> 10:05.663
I remember coming into... to work.

10:05.665 --> 10:08.282
Are you okay?

10:08.284 --> 10:10.104
Ah. I'm sorry. I just...

10:11.287 --> 10:15.123
Oh, my God, it feels like
my throat is closing up.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.458
Oh, God.

10:17.460 --> 10:20.831
I think someone poisoned my drink.

10:21.181 --> 10:23.297
Oh, my skin is on fire.

10:26.302 --> 10:27.247
I think we got it.

10:30.373 --> 10:32.740
It's not like I walked in
planning to kiss you.

10:32.742 --> 10:35.143
Can we not do this now? I'm working.

10:35.145 --> 10:38.145
- I can take you over here.
- Sorry, ma'am, he's closed.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.315
You can't just not talk to me.

10:41.317 --> 10:42.722
I'm not not talking to you.

10:42.723 --> 10:44.652
I just don't want to
talk about yesterday.

10:44.654 --> 10:45.946
We can talk about anything else.

10:45.947 --> 10:48.239
You want to talk about SpaceX, I'm in.

10:48.241 --> 10:49.323
Uh, okay.

10:49.325 --> 10:50.741
I think it's really gross

10:50.743 --> 10:52.410
that only rich people
get to go to space,

10:52.412 --> 10:54.162
and also it's like,
focus on Earth problems

10:54.164 --> 10:56.414
- before we set up shop on Mars.
- Interesting. Counterpoint.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.249
Okay, I don't really
want to talk about this.

10:58.251 --> 10:59.500
I want to talk about yesterday.

10:59.502 --> 11:01.836
Well I don't, okay? Ma'am.

11:01.838 --> 11:04.338
- It's fine.
- No, still closed, ma'am.

11:04.340 --> 11:06.674
- Thanks.
- Okay fine.

11:06.676 --> 11:09.177
I got two minutes until my break. Go.

11:09.605 --> 11:12.230
Um, uh, okay well

11:12.232 --> 11:15.037
um, obviously there are...

11:16.352 --> 11:18.519
feelings... I mean, not obviously.

11:18.521 --> 11:20.087
I guess seemingly.

11:20.658 --> 11:23.858
I just really didn't think this
would be a one-sided conversation.

11:23.860 --> 11:26.410
- Look, what I want to say...
- Hey Ames.

11:27.129 --> 11:28.213
Hi, Adam.

11:28.748 --> 11:30.567
- Adam's here.
- I see that.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.868
Hey, Adam. Uh, congratulations.

11:33.870 --> 11:34.763
Thanks, man.

11:35.255 --> 11:36.667
Congratulations on what?

11:36.859 --> 11:37.825
♪

11:41.074 --> 11:44.151
Uh. So what are you doing here?

11:44.152 --> 11:46.903
You left a message saying
we needed to talk in person.

11:46.905 --> 11:48.554
I meant, like, after work.

11:48.556 --> 11:51.107
You said it was urgent.
I needed batteries anyways.

11:51.109 --> 11:52.725
So I thought since you get a discount.

11:52.727 --> 11:55.828
Well, I can't really use
my discount on friends, so...

11:55.830 --> 11:57.969
Bigger fish to fry. Look, Adam.

11:57.970 --> 12:00.119
Can we talk about this later?
It's kind of a long story.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.406
Yo, Amy. I left that baby
stuff by your locker.

12:02.408 --> 12:05.125
Now that you're pregnant,
it's no time to be stingy.

12:05.127 --> 12:06.456
That guy's got great timing.

12:06.457 --> 12:07.562
You're pregnant?!

12:08.095 --> 12:09.153
I'm sor... who is?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.831
- No, not...
- No, no, no, no, no.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.636
- Of course not.
- No, not with Jonah.

12:14.637 --> 12:16.541
No, don't worry. It's... it's yours.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.958
Okay, good. What?

12:19.592 --> 12:21.143
Yep. Surprise.

12:21.448 --> 12:22.888
I'm sorry. How did this even...

12:22.889 --> 12:25.591
I mean, I know how it... wow.

12:25.974 --> 12:27.676
I know. It's a lot to take in.

12:27.677 --> 12:30.858
It just... this is not how I planned
on telling you that I'm pregnant.

12:30.859 --> 12:31.980
Who's pregnant?

12:32.438 --> 12:32.943
Damn it.

12:32.945 --> 12:35.456
I think we should invest in
some dividers or something.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.367
What's going on?

12:36.368 --> 12:37.661
- Who is this guy?
- Um.

12:37.662 --> 12:40.167
This is... this is Alex,
our beverage rep.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.830
Or I mean, and other things,

12:42.832 --> 12:44.235
but we just haven't really
discussed labels.

12:44.236 --> 12:45.486
Well, I'll let you guys all talk.

12:45.487 --> 12:46.828
No, no, no, no.
You're fine where you are.

12:46.829 --> 12:48.485
I will move back in
with you if you want.

12:48.487 --> 12:49.231
- What?
- Wow.

12:49.232 --> 12:50.343
Hold up. Who is this guy?

12:50.344 --> 12:52.356
- Are you dating him too?
- No, no.

12:52.358 --> 12:53.558
No, this is my ex-husband.

12:53.559 --> 12:55.110
And we're having a baby together.

12:55.111 --> 12:57.261
- And maybe getting remarried.
- Oh, my God.

12:57.263 --> 12:58.320
Well, you've got your hands full.

12:58.321 --> 12:59.429
So I'm gonna take my break now.

12:59.430 --> 13:00.899
No, I just really want
to finish our talk.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.640
We can talk about SpaceX

13:02.641 --> 13:04.672
- another time.
- No, we can't.

13:04.673 --> 13:06.804
Not at the rate that they're
burning through capital.

13:06.806 --> 13:09.773
- Um, I can't find my mommy.
- Grownups are talking.

13:09.775 --> 13:12.447
Hey, I'll help you find your mommy.

13:15.469 --> 13:17.924
- What kind of beverages?
- It runs the gamut.

13:18.633 --> 13:19.763
I love beverages.

13:20.836 --> 13:23.188
We were all so scared.

13:23.415 --> 13:26.154
And I made a promise to myself that day

13:26.155 --> 13:29.891
that if I survived, I would let
the people that I love know

13:29.892 --> 13:31.450
how much they mean to me.

13:31.806 --> 13:33.446
Every. Day.

13:35.621 --> 13:37.390
Okay, Mateo,

13:37.391 --> 13:39.868
you seem to be hitting
the drama a little hard.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.147
Oh okay.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.123
You said you wanted emotion.
I gave you emotion.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.954
Well, maybe less emotion.

13:47.209 --> 13:48.784
All right, got it. No problem.

13:50.228 --> 13:52.861
It was chaos. People screaming.

13:52.918 --> 13:54.984
Debris flying everywhere like locusts.

13:55.313 --> 13:56.858
I started my shift a boy.

13:57.319 --> 13:59.204
- But I clocked out a man...
- Okay, that's good.

13:59.335 --> 14:01.024
That's good. I think we've seen enough.

14:01.025 --> 14:01.811
Moving on.

14:02.201 --> 14:04.098
- Gonna move on.
- Wait, I'm sorry.

14:04.099 --> 14:06.444
Okay? I'm trying to do
it normal, but it's...

14:07.006 --> 14:10.561
It was crazy when I think
about that tornado.

14:11.814 --> 14:12.930
You know, it's...

14:13.958 --> 14:15.967
You think you know what
it's like to be scared.

14:15.968 --> 14:19.137
But then when you feel true fear

14:19.819 --> 14:23.434
for the first time, it envelopes you

14:23.435 --> 14:25.768
and crushes you.

14:27.371 --> 14:29.048
But then it sort of comforts you.

14:29.589 --> 14:34.158
Like a hug, and I... I don't know,

14:35.046 --> 14:36.643
it's hard to explain, but it...

14:38.297 --> 14:39.213
Ugh.

14:41.267 --> 14:43.367
Sorry.

14:44.632 --> 14:45.555
Aw.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.122
Are you kidding me right now?!

14:52.238 --> 14:55.326
Hey. What's happening?

14:55.327 --> 14:56.784
Mm, sorry I can't talk right now.

14:56.785 --> 14:59.873
- I'm a blanket.
- Oh. Hm, okay.

15:00.053 --> 15:03.835
Can you maybe be a blanket that
helps me stock body scrub?

15:03.836 --> 15:05.555
Mm, blankets don't have hands.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.910
Stop.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.928
I, uh... I want to meet your parents.

15:10.930 --> 15:11.688
Oh. Um...

15:12.251 --> 15:15.425
I mean, it feels like
we're getting serious, right?

15:16.001 --> 15:18.922
Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah.

15:20.133 --> 15:22.555
Okay, um, how about
a Mother's Day brunch?

15:22.556 --> 15:25.099
We doing brunch?
I'm always down for brunch.

15:25.247 --> 15:27.394
Oh, uh, it's just us.

15:27.396 --> 15:29.805
Oh, okay. Well we should
meet up afterwards.

15:30.102 --> 15:31.625
I'm supposed to meet
my mom later that day,

15:31.626 --> 15:33.631
but I can blow it off,
so it's totally fine.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.470
Hey, Alex, it's Carol from Cloud 9.

15:36.472 --> 15:38.323
I got your number off
of the vendor list.

15:38.324 --> 15:41.182
I was the one that was vaping
by the Dumpster last Thursday,

15:41.183 --> 15:42.936
and you said, "Are you vaping?"

15:42.937 --> 15:44.027
And I said, "Yeah."

15:44.831 --> 15:46.900
Anyway, I heard about the breakup,

15:46.901 --> 15:48.531
and I just wanted to say sorry.

15:49.335 --> 15:52.436
So let me know if you ever
want to go grab drinks

15:52.438 --> 15:55.259
or you can just come by
for a massage or whatever.

15:55.970 --> 15:57.589
So how did Alex take it?

15:57.948 --> 15:59.592
Relatively well, I guess.

15:59.593 --> 16:01.551
I mean, I don't know how
you're supposed to take it

16:01.552 --> 16:03.078
when you find out the
woman you're dating

16:03.079 --> 16:04.636
is pregnant with another man's child.

16:04.637 --> 16:06.250
Oh, you should've asked me.

16:06.656 --> 16:08.823
I've had that conversation
multiple times.

16:08.824 --> 16:10.754
Well, now that you're single again,

16:10.755 --> 16:12.266
you and I should start hanging out more.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.492
We can call each other
"slut" in like, the fun way.

16:14.493 --> 16:15.758
Yeah, maybe.

16:15.759 --> 16:19.281
I mean, Adam did offer to get
back together, so we'll see.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.695
You're back with Adam. Yay, Amy.

16:21.696 --> 16:23.499
Well, no. Not really.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.698
I mean, yes, he offered,
but I'm not gonna do it.

16:25.699 --> 16:28.979
I'm sorry. The father of
your baby wants to step up?

16:29.391 --> 16:30.924
Do you watch any daytime talk shows?

16:30.926 --> 16:32.063
That never happens.

16:32.064 --> 16:34.411
There's clearly still an attraction.

16:34.413 --> 16:36.152
You did go back for seconds.

16:36.153 --> 16:39.383
I wouldn't say no to a man offering
to support me and my baby.

16:39.385 --> 16:40.246
He can't support me.

16:40.247 --> 16:41.895
He works part time at a PetSmart.

16:41.896 --> 16:43.630
- Which PetSmart?
- The one on Balson.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.407
- Oh, that's the good one.
- Oh, wow.

16:45.408 --> 16:48.142
I bet with his discount you can
get a lizard for like nothing.

16:48.144 --> 16:50.018
I'm willing to pay full
price for a lizard

16:50.020 --> 16:52.408
if it means I don't have to
get back with my ex-husband.

16:52.409 --> 16:56.265
I mean, I know it's not ideal, but given
the choice between Adam and no one?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.982
Okay, I don't really want
to talk about this anymore.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.230
So, uh, let's find something
else to talk about.

17:00.231 --> 17:01.382
Just one more thing.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.173
Ames.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.195
I thought a lot about this,

17:05.196 --> 17:06.443
and you being pregnant

17:06.444 --> 17:08.115
is not a deal breaker for me.

17:08.615 --> 17:10.222
I may not be that baby's father,

17:10.986 --> 17:13.169
but I'm willing to step
up and be its dad.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.029
Thank you, Marcus. I'll let you know.

17:17.247 --> 17:19.771
Okay, now two men are
willing to be the father.

not do this right now?

18:30.332 --> 18:33.326
I'm sorry. I just... it's
been a really rough day.

18:33.327 --> 18:36.126
And I don't know how
much more I can take.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.263
Okay.

18:40.515 --> 18:42.011
What is that supposed to mean?

18:42.012 --> 18:44.261
What? I said okay.

18:44.262 --> 18:47.955
No. You said "o-kayyyy."

18:47.956 --> 18:50.362
Well, it's just... it's a
little annoying, you know.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.887
You waited to talk to me all day,

18:51.888 --> 18:53.728
and when I'm ready,
it's just like, "Nah."

18:53.729 --> 18:55.442
It's what you want when you want it.

18:55.443 --> 18:57.255
All right, well I don't know
if you've noticed, Jonah,

18:57.256 --> 18:59.027
but I'm sort of going
through some things.

18:59.028 --> 19:01.635
Yeah, I get that. You know,
I guess I'm just saying

19:01.636 --> 19:03.574
- everybody has problems...
- Oh, really?

19:03.575 --> 19:05.293
What are your problems, Jonah?

19:05.294 --> 19:07.669
Did the farmers market
run out of your yogurt?

19:07.670 --> 19:10.500
Or... oh, your "New Yorker"
came late this month.

19:10.868 --> 19:12.798
"The New Yorker" is weekly,

19:12.799 --> 19:14.351
and yeah, fine, okay.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.081
Maybe you have a little
more stuff than I do...

19:17.082 --> 19:18.519
A little more stuff?

19:18.520 --> 19:19.813
But that doesn't mean
that you get to just

19:19.814 --> 19:21.290
dismiss anything I say.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.627
Oh, my God. Cry me a river.

19:22.628 --> 19:23.999
This is what I'm talking about!

19:24.000 --> 19:25.470
You love playing the martyr.

19:25.471 --> 19:27.925
You get to just judge everybody else,

19:27.926 --> 19:29.829
but nobody gets to criticize
you on your crap.

19:29.830 --> 19:32.309
Are you really that pissed
off that I kissed you?

19:32.310 --> 19:34.613
No, I'm pissed off that
I waited around for you

19:34.614 --> 19:37.764
for two years, and you waited
until I was in a relationship

19:37.765 --> 19:39.206
and you were pregnant to kiss me.

19:39.518 --> 19:41.479
Who asked you to wait around?

19:41.745 --> 19:43.835
I don't even know what you're
still doing here, Jonah.

19:43.837 --> 19:45.410
You can leave whenever you want.

19:45.411 --> 19:48.538
So could you, but we all know
that's never gonna happen.

19:55.578 --> 19:56.611
Go to hell, Jonah.

19:58.992 --> 20:01.586
Here at Store 1217, we're a family,

20:02.474 --> 20:05.184
and we got through that
day like a family.

20:05.887 --> 20:06.928
Like a family.

20:07.545 --> 20:08.780

Yeah, totally.

20:20.988 --> 20:22.016

That could seriously be on YouTube.

20:23.735 --> 20:25.797
Guys, I would watch a show about us.

20:25.798 --> 20:28.070
Me too. I want to show Bo.

20:28.071 --> 20:29.978
He's never seen me in a
video with clothes on.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.678
After watching it, I got to say,

20:31.679 --> 20:33.787
a lot of the key choices were mine, so.
