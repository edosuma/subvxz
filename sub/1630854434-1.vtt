WEBVTT

01:52.880 --> 01:55.615
Hey, let me out.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.118
Open up!

01:59.954 --> 02:01.122
Hey, open up!

02:38.525 --> 02:40.962
<i>This is Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

02:40.995 --> 02:43.496
Little Swann, it's me.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.232
We haven't talked much
in a while.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.269
Wanna give you some advice.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.938
You wanna be
in this fucked up business,

02:50.972 --> 02:54.175
you need a partner
to watch your back.

02:54.208 --> 02:58.079
Yeah, I had a guy once,
Robbie Cole.

02:58.112 --> 03:02.083
Wish I trusted him,
it's a little late for that now.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.151
You are a good kid.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.685
Yeah, I love you, son.

03:08.655 --> 03:09.689
I gotta go.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.200
Put down your weapon!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.040
Now!

03:26.073 --> 03:30.244
The 1873 supreme court
ruled when bail is reached,

03:30.277 --> 03:35.249
the bail bondsmen can exercise
the rights of the court.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.518
My name is Ian Swann.
This man is my prisoner.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.241
Hold your fire!

04:27.168 --> 04:28.936
Thanks.

04:54.794 --> 04:58.132
Hi, Robbie.
What are you doing here?

04:58.165 --> 04:59.799
Hey, Nikki. Have a seat.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.102
Just working.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.369
On your bar tab?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.636
That too.

05:05.172 --> 05:08.008
I got a jumper
on an auto theft rap.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.246
Supposed to be
on the beach today.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.756
Well, if you're looking
for koa kahale

05:13.780 --> 05:15.249
you're not gonna find him here.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.383
Well, you know him?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.852
I know his family.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.253
His mom works at the club.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.855
You know where he is today?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.859
Well, I might.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.294
But I want something in return.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.196
Oh yeah,
what do you have in mind?

05:29.230 --> 05:30.397
Six bullets.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.299
What?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.268
Koa's a good kid.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.146
Getting busted might just be
the wakeup call he needs

05:36.170 --> 05:39.073
but I don't wanna see him
get hurt.

05:39.106 --> 05:43.244
Look, I'm a pro, Nikki.
I've never lost a client yet.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.745
The bullets, Robbie.

05:47.915 --> 05:48.916
You serious, huh?

05:51.285 --> 05:56.991
Alright. Here you go.
You happy now?

05:57.024 --> 05:59.126
He's trained to fight MMA today.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.163
They're set up down the beach
by the banyan trees.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.832
MMA fighter, huh?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.799
This should be interesting.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.469
You can have these back later
tonight.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.137
Drink's on me.

06:10.171 --> 06:11.381
That sounds good,
but if I have a problem,

06:11.405 --> 06:13.974
unarmed, that's on you too.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.194
<i>It's another beautiful day
in paradise.</i>

06:24.218 --> 06:26.753
<i>It's wb radio Maui.</i>

06:26.786 --> 06:30.457
<i>Morning news local</i>
<i>businessman Thomas Kane</i>
<i>in today's...</i>

06:30.491 --> 06:33.093
<i>Just reminding you all
to get out there and vote.</i>

06:44.271 --> 06:46.907
Nobody near the cages
unless they want
to get their ass beat.

06:46.941 --> 06:49.376
Now, where's your
aloha spirit, bro?

06:49.410 --> 06:53.314
I'm just here to deliver
a little something to uh...

06:53.347 --> 06:55.015
Koa kahale.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.119
Yeah, that's him.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.889
No, no, no.
Not now, not today, man.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.460
I know this guy.
He's not even a real cop.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.897
Manu. You still collecting
outstanding warrants?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.966
Those ain't lotto
tickets, buddy.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.766
We're protected.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.970
Take one more step
and see what happens.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.073
Well, here I am.
And here's my protection.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.775
Your fighter is now under
my legal jurisdiction. Period.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.078
How bad do you want him?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.280
Me? Not that bad.

07:26.313 --> 07:30.217
But Maui pd,
they want the idiot
who uh, skipped bail

07:30.251 --> 07:33.020
before joy-riding
in their cruiser.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.955
My mom's got heart problems.

07:34.989 --> 07:36.390
I had to get her to the hospital

07:36.423 --> 07:38.125
and that cop car
was just sitting there.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.792
I was like,
what's the big difference

07:39.827 --> 07:41.328
between an ambulance
and a cop car?

07:41.362 --> 07:43.297
That is so incredibly dumb.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.466
I actually believe it's true.

07:45.499 --> 07:50.070
Come on. There's a ufc
scout coming, man.
This is my day.

07:50.104 --> 07:51.414
Look, you're either gonna come
with me now

07:51.438 --> 07:53.307
or I'm gonna call it in.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.118
But Maui pd ain't gonna let
you leave this beach

07:55.142 --> 07:57.578
without tearing your acl,
that's for sure.

07:57.611 --> 08:01.949
Maybe, just maybe,
you let the kid fight today.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.151
Then after, he comes in
without a fuss.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.552
Think you can do that?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.354
Maybe.

08:07.388 --> 08:10.424
One question.
You gonna win in the second?

08:12.926 --> 08:13.961
Get it on.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.375
Let's hear it
for our beautiful ring girl.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.481
Round two. Fighters in position.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.952
Hey.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.486
Put another 20 on koa.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.323
And let's fight!

08:43.357 --> 08:44.391
Hit him, hit him.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.594
Koa is dancing.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.708
The less experienced fighter
feeling the veteran out.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.934
Come on, koa!

09:07.581 --> 09:09.550
This is the kid
I told you about.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.318
Will be good to have
on our crew.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.994
Kahale's in trouble.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.430
Let's go! Finish him.

09:28.535 --> 09:29.970
Goddammit, finish him!

09:33.507 --> 09:35.142
Whoa. There it is.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.577
Kahale has broken in
a choke hold.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.047
Koa has taken out.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.485
The match goes to koa kahale!
Let's hear it for koa.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.387
Nice, koa.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.454
Beautiful.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.403
I'm so proud.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.204
It's all for you, ma.

10:04.238 --> 10:06.173
- Time to go, koa.
- Police!

10:06.206 --> 10:08.509
Koa kahale!
Hands where I can see them.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.944
Easy, honey. He's my collar.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.479
Don't call me honey, Robbie.

10:12.513 --> 10:14.348
Savannah, you know the drill.
Alright?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.450
You can't arrest him
if he's already in my custody.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.252
Then why isn't he in cuffs?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.686
I got this under control.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.121
Yeah, I'm with him!

10:21.155 --> 10:22.556
This is bullshit, Robbie!

10:22.589 --> 10:24.558
You give your profession
a bad name.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.660
Says the cop pointing a gun
at an unarmed perp.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.329
You got a warrant?
Show it or get the fuck
out of my ring.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.231
If this is your ring,

10:31.265 --> 10:32.966
then you're harboring
an escaped felon.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.401
I can pull your license

10:34.435 --> 10:36.079
and shut down
this little shit show for good.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.639
Guys, take it down...
Look, you spooked him!

10:38.672 --> 10:40.040
Don't even blame me!

10:40.073 --> 10:41.508
Hey! Hey! Stop!

10:50.284 --> 10:51.351
Hey!

11:04.398 --> 11:06.500
Hey, relax. Hey, relax!

11:06.533 --> 11:08.535
One move and I'll light you up
like new year's Eve.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.074
Hey!

11:14.107 --> 11:15.718
I saw you in pursuit.
Looked like you needed a hand.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.145
Oh yeah? No, I had him. Thanks.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.446
I'm the arresting officer.

11:22.316 --> 11:25.786
You're Robbie Cole, right?
You knew my dad.

11:25.820 --> 11:27.054
Who is this?

11:28.655 --> 11:30.123
You're Ian Swann's son?

11:37.064 --> 11:39.733
Alright, Bernie,
koa kahale was my bounty.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.768
Tell the paymaster
to have my check ready.

11:41.803 --> 11:44.404
Your commission
is a standard 10% of bail.

11:44.438 --> 11:45.807
That's 100 bucks, man.

11:45.840 --> 11:49.376
What? 10% of
10,000 is a grand, buddy.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.712
There was a typo.
His bail is actually a $1,000.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.680
I mean, the kid
is not exactly El chapo.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.652
Happy now?

11:58.685 --> 12:02.289
No. Barely covered my bar tab.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.425
Ryan, meet Savannah tui,
homicide detective.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.327
Don't get fooled
by her pretty face.

12:07.361 --> 12:08.762
She's a real pit-bull.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.398
I love you too, Robbie.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.234
So, you're Ian Swann's son?
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:14.268 --> 12:15.708
I've been on the case
from the start.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.504
Then you must have
some idea who did it.

12:17.538 --> 12:20.340
Look, Ryan, your dad and I
used to work together.

12:20.374 --> 12:22.142
He made a lot of enemies
on this island.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.511
Yeah. He had that effect
on people, so?

12:24.545 --> 12:26.613
If anything, what we've got
is too many suspects.

12:26.647 --> 12:27.825
Yeah, well gimme a list,
I'll run 'em down.

12:27.849 --> 12:29.449
You're not a cop.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.518
Yeah, I'm better than a cop.
Fewer rules.

12:31.552 --> 12:33.855
Oh, shit.
Another bounty hunter?

12:33.888 --> 12:36.790
This island's way too small
for another ass-kicking cowboy.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.226
Yeah. Well, if that's
what you thought of my dad,

12:39.259 --> 12:40.460
then you've got him all wrong,

12:40.494 --> 12:41.638
which means
you'll never solve shit.

12:41.662 --> 12:43.163
Hey.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.731
Savannah's the last cop
on this island

12:44.765 --> 12:46.400
that actually gives a damn.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.368
You're gonna want her
on your side.

12:48.402 --> 12:49.804
Give us a little time, Ryan.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.214
Why don't you take
a couple of days off

12:51.238 --> 12:52.606
and enjoy our beaches, okay?

12:55.175 --> 12:56.811
What did dad do to get himself...

12:56.844 --> 12:59.580
Hey, you got daddy issues?
Don't talk about him here.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.883
I know a good, quiet place.
Hannah's bar.

13:01.916 --> 13:03.750
You're a smart kid,
you'll find it.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.452
Meet me there at four.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.433
Go ahead.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.471
Oh, jeez.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.641
I know. Sharks.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.242
That... that isn't much
of a body.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.178
It's... it's just...

13:31.211 --> 13:33.246
The body wasn't recovered
for at least 24 hours.

13:34.949 --> 13:37.250
The DNA was a match
to his Chicago pd records.

13:40.955 --> 13:42.656
They recovered a few things
from his car,

13:42.689 --> 13:44.658
including his ID.
It's over there.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.166
Yeah. Yeah, that's uh...

13:54.768 --> 13:59.773
That's him.

same day he got killed?

14:16.757 --> 14:19.226
He must have known
he wasn't gonna make it.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.862
Told me to contact you.

14:20.895 --> 14:23.363
That figures.

14:23.397 --> 14:24.866
He always thought
I owed him one,

14:24.899 --> 14:27.467
but he was wrong
about that shit.

14:27.501 --> 14:29.736
What do you say
we make it interesting?

14:29.770 --> 14:31.405
Wanna 20 to the winner?

Nice.

14:39.613 --> 14:40.781
Thanks.

14:40.815 --> 14:43.350
Your dad was the real deal.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.419
Little hard to handle sometime.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.653
Yeah, tell me about it.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.724
He was hell of a bounty hunter,
though.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.793
Best I'd ever seen.
And a good partner.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.497
'Course, then there was
that little misunderstanding

14:57.531 --> 14:58.833
about your mom and I.

15:00.534 --> 15:02.269
Wait, that was you?

15:03.905 --> 15:05.973
I ain't proud of it,
but shit happens.

15:06.007 --> 15:08.608
Hey, shit happens.
They got divorced over it.

15:08.642 --> 15:12.479
You know that, right?
You... you ruined my childhood.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.449
It was nothing, okay.
Your dad over reacted.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.717
Your mom was half his age.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.252
I think she just wanted
his attention.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.624
What, am I just supposed
to agree with you?

15:24.658 --> 15:26.928
Like I said,
I ain't proud of it.

15:26.961 --> 15:29.663
I fucked up.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.966
I lost a great partner
and a friend.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.369
Do you know why my dad
came back to Hawaii?

15:38.505 --> 15:41.308
Your dad hadn't talked to me
in over 10 years, man.

15:44.979 --> 15:47.447
Word was, he was tracking
a real whale.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.050
A big ass bounty.

15:49.083 --> 15:53.054
I figured he must have died
trying to collect it.

15:53.087 --> 15:55.555
You ever hear
of Terrance billford?

15:55.589 --> 15:57.424
Yeah.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.994
Biggest bounty on record.
Set at eight figures.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.763
Here's why.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.465
Took out three cops
execution style.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.036
I think dad was obsessed
with him.

16:09.070 --> 16:10.938
Well, he wasn't the only one.

16:10.972 --> 16:14.741
I mean everybody in the game
knows billford's story.

16:14.775 --> 16:18.880
He skipped bail on murder,
drug trafficking charges.

16:18.913 --> 16:22.415
I mean, the son of a bitch
was El gringo narco,

16:22.449 --> 16:24.484
biggest meth operation
in the midwest.

16:24.518 --> 16:27.320
I mean, he killed cops,
even his own kin.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.023
I mean, who allows bail on that?

16:29.056 --> 16:30.724
Judge set the bail
at 10 million.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.069
He didn't even think
that billford

16:32.093 --> 16:33.593
or anybody else
could ever pay it.

16:33.627 --> 16:35.662
Billford paid in cash, man.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.965
Then he walks straight
out of the court.

16:37.999 --> 16:39.499
Nobody sees him again.

16:40.968 --> 16:43.403
I don't know...

16:43.436 --> 16:47.008
I think dad might have
finally found him.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.076
It's a small jungle, kid.

16:49.110 --> 16:51.378
I mean, if there was a tiger
that big on the island,

16:51.411 --> 16:52.512
I'd know about it.

16:52.546 --> 16:53.848
Yeah, whatever happened,

16:55.782 --> 16:57.852
I'm not leaving until
I find out who killed him.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.621
- Nice game.
- Yeah, thanks.

17:01.655 --> 17:02.900
I mean, you let me win,
and we both know it.

17:02.924 --> 17:05.625
But I'm keeping this anyway.

17:05.659 --> 17:08.561
So uh, who's helping you
organize everything?

17:08.595 --> 17:09.663
Organize what?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.933
Funeral... the stuff.

17:11.965 --> 17:15.136
Right, yeah. Look um...

17:15.169 --> 17:18.839
Yeah, that's me.
I guess, I uh...

17:18.873 --> 17:22.474
There's not much left
of him to Bury.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.079
They gave me some things
they found in his car.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.013
Including this.

17:27.048 --> 17:30.784
Lelani arms, yeah.
I know the hotel.

17:30.818 --> 17:32.162
Yeah, if dad had
a lead on billford,

17:32.186 --> 17:35.156
I might still find
it here, right?

17:35.189 --> 17:38.425
Look, your dad was a harder
man than both of us.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.895
Whatever he was on to
got him killed.

17:40.928 --> 17:42.596
What are the chances
I can convince you

17:42.629 --> 17:43.998
to just stay out of this?

17:44.031 --> 17:46.399
Look man, I didn't
come here for a tan.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.136
Right.

17:49.170 --> 17:52.639
Well, don't think I'm letting
you score a bounty

17:52.672 --> 17:55.042
like billford
right under my nose.

17:55.076 --> 17:57.410
Without splitting it 50-50.

18:02.716 --> 18:04.751
You wanna get to work or not?

18:05.853 --> 18:07.855
Let's do it.

18:07.889 --> 18:09.522
Let's do it.

18:35.983 --> 18:37.484
Mr. Buckley.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.587
Oh, hello. How are you?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.723
Wonderful to see you.
What a fabulous affair!

18:43.757 --> 18:47.761
Now, my husband is telling me
that your plans for Maui

18:47.794 --> 18:49.964
will make it a new
international business hub.

18:49.997 --> 18:53.000
Well, I know your husband.
He's a very wise man.

18:53.034 --> 18:55.202
And that's not
just because he chose you.

18:55.236 --> 18:57.771
Oh, thank you.

18:57.805 --> 19:01.909
Now, you love Hawaii,
I love Hawaii.

19:01.943 --> 19:03.510
We all love Hawaii.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.613
But, being said,
we have to diversify.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.615
We have to expand.

19:08.648 --> 19:12.119
And, with due respect,
these grandfather laws,

19:12.153 --> 19:15.022
I mean really, it's like
every third banyan tree

19:15.056 --> 19:16.857
is a sacred tribe.

19:16.891 --> 19:20.194
We know. It's like the word
"profit" is a dirty word.

19:20.227 --> 19:24.165
Exactly. And that's why,
I'm supporting Thomas Kane.

19:24.198 --> 19:27.201
It should be our privilege
to expand opportunities

19:27.234 --> 19:28.803
for all of Hawaii.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.905
- Here, dad.
- Oh, good. Time for a toast.

19:30.938 --> 19:32.206
Excuse me.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.673
Everyone!

19:34.875 --> 19:37.078
A toast to Thomas Kane.

19:37.111 --> 19:39.914
The next great senator
of Hawaii.

19:44.185 --> 19:47.288
- And who is this handsome
young man?
- Mm.

19:47.321 --> 19:50.257
This is my son, ern.
And this is Mrs. Tilly.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.759
- Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
- Well, it's always
a pleasure

19:52.792 --> 19:54.128
to meet
a well-mannered young man.

19:55.863 --> 19:58.966
And, his mother's here tonight?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.668
No, his... his mother
passed away a few years ago.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.938
But we're healing, doing fine.

20:03.971 --> 20:06.073
Well, it would be our pleasure
to have you two

20:06.107 --> 20:07.908
for dinner one night.

20:07.942 --> 20:10.643
You just name the evening
and I will have our chefs

20:10.677 --> 20:13.080
whip up some fine
Louisiana cooking.

20:13.114 --> 20:14.949
That is an unexpected
invitation.

20:14.982 --> 20:16.222
- Hmm.
- What do you think, son?

20:16.250 --> 20:17.284
Yeah. Yes, I am.

20:17.318 --> 20:18.853
Let's do then.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.560
So, what's the plan?

20:27.594 --> 20:28.939
There's too many eyes
at the front desk.

20:28.963 --> 20:30.297
Let me give you the tour.

20:40.975 --> 20:43.277
Yeah, it's me.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.147
You know that bastard, who used
to partner with Ian Swann?

20:46.180 --> 20:47.580
He just showed up.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.687
- Jesus.
- Holy shit.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.665
Well, whatever
they were looking for,

21:05.698 --> 21:07.634
- i doubt they found it.
- Why do you say that?

21:07.667 --> 21:11.038
Because they would've stopped
before they trashed everything.

21:13.174 --> 21:15.309
Hey.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.610
Whoever was here,
we must have just missed them.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.612
We'll try to think like
your old man, alright?

21:19.646 --> 21:20.957
He had evidence
on these bastards,

21:20.981 --> 21:22.316
where would he hide it?

21:28.055 --> 21:30.657
One of my guys spotted
Robbie Cole heading upstairs.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.093
Cole?

21:32.126 --> 21:34.061
That's not
a fucking coincidence, is it?

21:44.972 --> 21:46.807
Is one of our men
still in the room?

21:46.841 --> 21:47.975
Fuck no.

21:55.116 --> 21:56.749
Hey, hey. Check it out.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.822
Billford.

22:01.856 --> 22:04.258
Yeah. He looks dead.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.795
I can't let Cole find something
you fucking idiots missed.

22:12.199 --> 22:14.701
Housekeeping.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.070
No thanks.

22:17.104 --> 22:19.240
Turn down your bed, sir?

22:19.273 --> 22:21.108
Uh, bed's already turned down.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.247
Hey!

22:26.280 --> 22:27.747
Get down!

22:39.960 --> 22:41.996
What the fuck!

22:43.430 --> 22:45.432
She's gone. Stay low.

22:47.968 --> 22:49.336
Fuck, Nikki!

22:49.370 --> 22:51.005
Shit!

23:31.812 --> 23:32.947
It's gone to shit.

23:32.980 --> 23:34.114
Jam the police band.

23:34.148 --> 23:35.416
Copy that.

24:12.086 --> 24:14.288
What's happening?

24:14.321 --> 24:15.990
The guy jumped overboard.

24:16.023 --> 24:17.891
From the tenth floor?
Is he dead?

24:17.925 --> 24:20.094
I can't tell.
He hit the goddamn pool pond.

24:25.966 --> 24:28.936
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm so sorry.

24:28.969 --> 24:31.071
There's been a disturbance
next door

24:31.105 --> 24:34.375
and I'm told that we need
to evacuate immediately.

24:34.408 --> 24:37.845
I apologize
but please allow Maui's best

24:37.878 --> 24:39.513
to escort you to your cars.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.181
And have a wonderful night.

24:41.215 --> 24:45.052
Don't forget to...
To vote for Thomas Kane.

24:45.085 --> 24:46.487
What the fuck is happening?

24:50.557 --> 24:52.493
I think he still might be
under the water.

24:52.526 --> 24:55.562
Well, finish him.
And don't stop till
the fucking body floats.

25:14.948 --> 25:15.983
Freeze!

25:24.458 --> 25:26.327
Ryan Swann!

25:26.360 --> 25:29.430
Let's go, come with me.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

25:52.553 --> 25:54.054
Get in.

25:54.088 --> 25:55.923
- Where am I going?
- Nowhere.

25:55.956 --> 25:58.559
Now, get your ass in the car
or go back in the cell.

25:58.592 --> 25:59.626
Doesn't matter to me.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.670
Coffee?

26:09.703 --> 26:12.573
No thanks.

26:12.606 --> 26:16.110
Oh, that's a shame.
Double Espresso.

26:16.143 --> 26:18.946
Vanilla spiced, seasoned huh.

26:20.381 --> 26:23.183
I'm Buckley.
Pleasure to meet you.

26:23.217 --> 26:25.018
Hey, you wanna tell me
what I'm doing here?

26:25.052 --> 26:27.354
Well, it's just
a friendly conversation,

26:27.388 --> 26:28.422
that's all.

26:30.657 --> 26:34.061
Do you know
why I have a double Espresso?

26:36.063 --> 26:38.332
Because I didn't sleep
last night.

26:38.365 --> 26:41.969
Those fireworks in the hotel
were spectacular.

26:42.002 --> 26:43.642
I thought it was a goddamn
fourth of July.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.039
Put an early end
to a party of mine.

26:46.073 --> 26:47.207
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:47.241 --> 26:49.009
Hm.

26:49.042 --> 26:52.446
And I understand that
you are lucky to be alive.

26:54.381 --> 26:56.316
It's funny I don't feel lucky.

26:56.350 --> 26:59.620
I wouldn't either.
You lost your father.

26:59.653 --> 27:02.289
Very sorry about that.
My sympathies.

27:02.322 --> 27:03.357
Did you know him?

27:03.390 --> 27:05.058
Well, I met him once only

27:05.092 --> 27:08.328
but he did made quite
an impression on me.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.200
Mr. Buckley?

27:13.233 --> 27:14.511
The gentleman over there
just told me

27:14.535 --> 27:15.969
to put his drink on your bill.

27:23.410 --> 27:24.745
You know him?

27:24.778 --> 27:27.314
I have no idea who he is.

27:27.347 --> 27:30.284
So, why don't you go over there
and ask him who he is?

27:30.317 --> 27:32.219
And if he doesn't have
the right answer,

27:32.252 --> 27:34.555
make sure that
he doesn't bother us again.

28:14.361 --> 28:16.296
Your man needed some fresh air.

28:19.399 --> 28:20.434
Do you mind?

28:22.102 --> 28:23.437
Well, let's see you have managed

28:23.470 --> 28:25.606
to invite yourself to my table

28:25.639 --> 28:27.541
and interrupt my dinner.

28:27.574 --> 28:29.243
Now, who the hell are you?

28:29.276 --> 28:32.379
My name is Swann, like the bird.

28:32.412 --> 28:35.516
Now, why would I buy you
a drink, Mr. Swann?

28:37.684 --> 28:39.419
I'm looking for a friend
of yours.

28:42.824 --> 28:45.292
I have no idea who this is.

28:45.325 --> 28:47.628
And if I did,
why the hell would I tell you?

28:47.661 --> 28:49.296
Now, if you don't mind,

28:49.329 --> 28:52.699
I would like to go back to
my delicious wagyu steak.

28:52.733 --> 28:56.336
You're funding a candidate
for senator.

28:56.370 --> 28:59.841
If this man is anyone near you,
you need my help.

28:59.874 --> 29:02.309
Are you saying that
this man is dangerous?

29:02.342 --> 29:05.512
The FBI thinks so.

29:05.546 --> 29:09.449
What about you, Mr. Swann?
Are... are you dangerous?

29:09.483 --> 29:11.285
Not to my friends.

29:11.318 --> 29:14.254
Well, that's too bad.
Because I have enough friends.

29:22.462 --> 29:25.232
Funny, he said
the same kind of thing.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.604
Thanks for the drink.

29:33.407 --> 29:37.244
You find out everything you can
about that son of a bitch.

29:37.277 --> 29:38.545
You got it, boss.

29:46.787 --> 29:49.556
Ah, such a tragedy, really.

29:49.590 --> 29:54.461
Did he ever um, tell you why,
he came to Hawaii?

29:54.494 --> 29:58.765
No. No, we ah... we lost touch.

29:58.799 --> 30:01.568
Well, that's a shame,
now that he's gone.

30:03.670 --> 30:07.574
Now, what... what transpired
last night though?

30:07.608 --> 30:10.477
I want to forget about it.

30:10.510 --> 30:12.279
It's kind of hard to forget.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.480
People died.

30:13.513 --> 30:14.816
I mean yes, but there's...

30:14.849 --> 30:16.450
There's surveillance
cameras there

30:16.483 --> 30:18.820
and I'm told,
that it was self-defense.

30:18.853 --> 30:20.822
They fired at you first.

30:20.855 --> 30:22.522
And now you wouldn't wanna
make a mountain

30:22.556 --> 30:23.825
out of molehill.

30:23.858 --> 30:25.692
I would just leave it...
Leave it alone.

30:28.195 --> 30:29.529
You're free to go.

30:39.706 --> 30:42.643
May I ask you uh,
what your plans are?

30:44.311 --> 30:45.345
I don't know.

30:46.747 --> 30:49.316
I'm thinking of sticking around.

30:49.349 --> 30:52.519
Yeah, someone killed my dad.

30:52.552 --> 30:53.855
I wanna know who.

30:53.888 --> 30:55.188
Hm, of course.

30:55.222 --> 30:56.390
You will, you'll find out.

30:56.423 --> 30:58.191
I mean, we're on it.

30:58.225 --> 31:00.594
This is Hawaii's best
looking after this.

31:00.627 --> 31:02.529
Why do you care?

31:02.562 --> 31:04.741
Well, because I believe
that there's some bad
players involved

31:04.765 --> 31:06.366
with your father's death.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.435
I liked to see them
come to justice.

31:09.971 --> 31:11.238
Yeah, so do I.

31:11.271 --> 31:12.706
Yes.

31:12.739 --> 31:15.242
Now, a word of advice,

31:15.275 --> 31:18.278
I would leave this island
and not come back.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.381
You've got a bright future,
but it's on the mainland,

31:21.415 --> 31:23.250
not here.

31:23.283 --> 31:24.651
If you stay till tomorrow, I...

31:24.685 --> 31:27.688
I can't promise
I can protect you.

31:27.721 --> 31:29.523
Protect me from who?

31:29.556 --> 31:30.757
I don't know.

31:30.791 --> 31:32.559
Maybe... maybe yourself.

31:32.592 --> 31:34.261
Oh, and by the way,

31:34.294 --> 31:36.596
there's a midnight flight,
Hawaiian airlines,

31:36.630 --> 31:39.766
and I understand
that they actually serve a meal.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.468
Well, who knows
they might throw in

31:41.501 --> 31:44.337
a complimentary pineapple
or a coconut.

31:44.371 --> 31:45.739
Something like that.

31:47.041 --> 31:48.642
Have a good trip.

32:03.825 --> 32:06.259
Ryan! What's going on?

32:06.293 --> 32:07.594
I heard you just got arrested.

32:07.627 --> 32:08.939
Well, they haven't even
charged me

32:08.963 --> 32:10.530
thanks to some guy
named Buckley.

32:10.564 --> 32:11.999
Oh, of course.

32:12.033 --> 32:13.835
He has a lot of influence
on this island.

32:13.868 --> 32:15.803
So, I noticed.

32:15.837 --> 32:17.637
So, I've been taken off
your father's case.

32:17.671 --> 32:19.773
Apparently being seen with you
is bad for my career.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.408
None of this makes any sense.

32:21.441 --> 32:22.652
You know,
what I'm really worried about

32:22.676 --> 32:24.544
right now is Robbie.

32:24.578 --> 32:26.713
I've been looking for him.
Was he with you last night?

32:26.747 --> 32:28.049
Yeah, last time I saw him,

32:28.082 --> 32:29.817
he had a bag pulled
over his head.

32:29.851 --> 32:31.384
Oh, my god.

32:31.418 --> 32:33.821
Yeah, we have to do something.

32:33.855 --> 32:36.456
Look, right now the police
are no help.

32:36.490 --> 32:38.926
The whole case
has been put on ice.

32:38.960 --> 32:42.029
But there's another way
we can find out
what happened to Robbie.

32:42.063 --> 32:44.303
There's some friends of mine
I want you to meet. Come on.

32:47.601 --> 32:49.436
Welcome to the rip tide club.

32:49.469 --> 32:52.006
Nice place.
It's kind of above my pay grade.

32:52.039 --> 32:54.441
Don't worry,
your money's no good here.

32:54.474 --> 32:55.843
This is Nikki's club.

32:55.877 --> 32:57.611
When I need intel
the force can't get,

32:57.644 --> 32:59.613
she always comes through.

32:59.646 --> 33:01.048
I'm about to show you

33:01.082 --> 33:02.592
how we know
what's going on in this club

33:02.616 --> 33:05.853
way before the cops do.
This way.

33:18.632 --> 33:21.368
Gentlemen,
I need you to clear out.

33:21.401 --> 33:23.436
Drinks on the house at the bar.

33:29.110 --> 33:31.678
Ladies, ladies, gather around.

33:31.711 --> 33:35.382
These ladies have given me
more leads than the entire mpd.

33:35.415 --> 33:36.984
Sooner or later,

33:37.018 --> 33:39.486
every bad boy on this island
winds up on this club.

33:39.519 --> 33:40.888
And after a few drinks,

33:40.922 --> 33:42.065
they just love to talk
to the girls.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.690
Damn right.

33:43.723 --> 33:45.135
Kai may look sweet,
but don't cross her.

33:45.159 --> 33:47.028
She did two tours
in Afghanistan.

33:47.061 --> 33:49.696
Semper fi. Muah!

33:49.729 --> 33:51.798
Oh, it's nice to meet you. Oh!

33:51.833 --> 33:53.700
Hey, I like the vibe back here.

33:54.801 --> 33:56.137
Relax, baby.

33:56.170 --> 33:58.105
You look like a rabbit
in a fox den.

33:59.773 --> 34:01.976
We wanna get a line on Robbie.

34:02.009 --> 34:05.112
You can trust everybody here.
They're devoted to the cause.

34:05.146 --> 34:06.780
What cause?

34:06.814 --> 34:09.416
The locals, their land
and their families.

34:09.449 --> 34:11.451
You taken him
to paradise city yet?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.820
What's that, another club?

34:12.853 --> 34:14.654
It's better than any club.

34:14.688 --> 34:17.389
It's the most beautiful place
on the island.

34:17.424 --> 34:18.757
And we want to keep it that way.

34:18.792 --> 34:20.127
The only problem is Buckley.

34:20.161 --> 34:21.661
I take it you're not a fan?

34:21.695 --> 34:23.030
Oh, hell no!

34:23.063 --> 34:24.797
Mining is off-limits in Hawaii.

34:24.831 --> 34:26.699
Especially the sacred mountains.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.668
There are clan elders
who control home land resources.

34:29.703 --> 34:31.605
And Buckley,
bought off all of them.

34:31.638 --> 34:33.174
What... what that's
gotta to do with...

34:33.206 --> 34:34.741
With Robbie? Or my dad?

34:34.774 --> 34:36.110
Maybe nothing.

34:36.143 --> 34:38.112
Or maybe that's what
last night was all about

34:38.145 --> 34:41.481
and the reason why buck
is so interested in you.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.083
Okay, ladies.

34:43.117 --> 34:45.418
You've all heard about the hit
at the lelani hotel.

34:45.452 --> 34:47.587
I need you to go out there
tonight, work the floor.

34:47.621 --> 34:49.991
Find out who wants to brag on
what happened to Robbie.

34:50.024 --> 34:51.491
- We got it.
- Alright. Go, girls.

34:51.524 --> 34:52.827
- I love you, ma.
- Bye, Ryan.

34:52.860 --> 34:54.962
Go. Go, girls go!

34:54.996 --> 34:57.530
Bye, Ryan.

34:57.564 --> 34:59.066
Get out there.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.968
That was a nice place.

35:01.002 --> 35:02.502
It was only the lunch crowd.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.437
I know, right.

35:06.941 --> 35:10.777
I know it's only been 24 hours
since you've been locked up.

35:10.811 --> 35:12.947
How you holding up?

35:12.980 --> 35:16.750
I'm feeling kinda nuts,
to be honest, you know?

35:16.783 --> 35:20.121
Back at the hotel, it was crazy.

35:20.154 --> 35:21.889
Tell me about it.

35:21.923 --> 35:24.959
I've never killed anyone before.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.861
I put a guy in a wheelchair
once in Jersey,

35:26.894 --> 35:29.163
but never killed anybody.

35:29.196 --> 35:31.464
I know. I pulled your file.

35:31.498 --> 35:34.035
Non-lethal force.

35:34.068 --> 35:35.702
I admire that,

35:35.735 --> 35:37.335
as long as you don't
get yourself killed.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.775
You know, Robbie's gone.

35:41.809 --> 35:43.677
I should be in jail,
but I'm not.

35:43.710 --> 35:45.913
And as far as I can tell,
nobody else is.

35:45.947 --> 35:48.082
Law doesn't work that way here.

35:48.115 --> 35:49.616
Buck will spin it.

35:49.649 --> 35:51.185
Yeah, well he already has.

35:51.218 --> 35:53.054
Local news just claimed
that a gas main blew

35:53.087 --> 35:55.488
at the lelani,
nothing about a shootout.

35:55.522 --> 35:56.623
Can you believe it?

35:56.656 --> 35:58.092
He's that deep into this town?

35:58.125 --> 36:01.262
Yes, and worse,
word is one of the elders

36:01.295 --> 36:04.731
was a hold out
on buck's mining scheme.

36:04.764 --> 36:06.566
One day he just disappeared.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.870
There's no body,
so no investigation.

36:09.904 --> 36:11.272
But there were rumors...

36:12.940 --> 36:14.942
That the elder was still alive

36:14.976 --> 36:16.978
when they dumped him
into haleakala.

36:21.048 --> 36:22.883
You think that's
what happened to Robbie?

36:22.917 --> 36:25.186
Ah, no.
Don't you count Robbie out.

36:25.219 --> 36:27.587
He can take care of himself.

36:27.620 --> 36:31.125
Okay still, we can't just
here and wait for a lead.

36:31.158 --> 36:32.625
What do you have in mind?

36:32.659 --> 36:34.095
I, uh...

36:37.131 --> 36:40.167
Can you... can you take me
to the crime scene?

36:40.201 --> 36:41.969
Where they shot my father down.

36:42.003 --> 36:44.637
There's not much to see,
the waves have them washed away.

36:46.773 --> 36:50.044
But yeah, what are you doing
tomorrow morning?

36:50.077 --> 36:51.578
Free as a bird.

36:51.611 --> 36:52.980
Great.

36:53.014 --> 36:55.582
Yeah. I'll see you.

37:31.819 --> 37:35.122
It happened in this cove.

37:35.156 --> 37:38.092
There were shell cases
everywhere.

37:38.125 --> 37:41.628
And your dad's rental car
was up there.

37:41.661 --> 37:43.064
It was shot to pieces.

37:43.097 --> 37:44.664
He must have put up
a good fight.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.133
Yeah, he always did.

37:52.973 --> 37:54.241
You okay?

37:54.275 --> 37:55.843
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

37:55.876 --> 37:57.777
Just ah, just give me
a moment, yeah?

38:05.219 --> 38:06.921
What's that?

38:06.954 --> 38:09.023
It's a very sophisticated
piece of equipment.

38:12.126 --> 38:13.626
That's a beach ball.

38:16.063 --> 38:17.331
It's about to become a part

38:17.364 --> 38:19.934
of an underwater metal detector.

38:19.967 --> 38:21.701
$19.99 on Amazon.

38:21.734 --> 38:22.870
It's... it's brilliant.

38:22.903 --> 38:25.873
- It really is.
- Yes, it is.

38:25.906 --> 38:29.043
The dive team combed
this entire cove.

38:29.076 --> 38:31.278
But you know what,
I think it's worth a try.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.355
<i>Little Swann,</i>

38:41.388 --> 38:43.157
<i>we haven't talked much
in a while.</i>

38:43.190 --> 38:45.426
<i>Just wanted to give you
some advice.</i>

38:45.459 --> 38:48.329
<i>You wanna be in this
fucked up business?</i>

38:55.768 --> 38:57.838
Drop the gun! Now!

39:00.941 --> 39:03.743
<i>Yep, you're a good kid.</i>

39:03.776 --> 39:06.313
<i>Yeah, I love you, son.
I gotta go.</i>

39:15.156 --> 39:16.789
Hey, what do you got?

39:16.824 --> 39:18.192
I'm not sure.

39:54.495 --> 39:57.965
Sleep is so important.

39:57.998 --> 40:02.236
And it's something that
I did not get any up last night.

40:04.438 --> 40:06.240
How did you sleep?

40:10.277 --> 40:12.813
Ain't that California king
something?

40:12.846 --> 40:15.282
I think it's the uh,
the memory foam.

40:15.316 --> 40:18.185
Ain't nothing like in the world.

40:18.219 --> 40:20.821
The bed was fine.

40:20.854 --> 40:23.357
But the doors and the windows
were bolted shut.

40:23.390 --> 40:25.159
That's a precaution.

40:25.192 --> 40:28.128
Now, old buddy, old pal,

40:28.162 --> 40:31.899
did you attack my people
at a hotel last night?

40:31.932 --> 40:34.268
Did you kill Ian Swann?

40:34.301 --> 40:35.469
I... I don't know.

40:35.502 --> 40:37.471
What... what is an Ian Swann?

40:37.504 --> 40:39.206
What about his son?

40:42.876 --> 40:46.413
I think that my guys
dropped you on your head

40:46.447 --> 40:48.781
when they were bringing
you here.

40:48.816 --> 40:52.219
The kid you were with last night
was picked up by the cops.

40:52.253 --> 40:56.123
But because they're friends
of mine, I let him go.

40:56.156 --> 40:59.226
Why make enemies
when you could make friends?

40:59.260 --> 41:02.396
But you... you're here
as a professional favor.

41:02.429 --> 41:06.233
Oh, so you did me a favor
by kidnapping me?

41:06.267 --> 41:08.469
Kidnapping! Sir...

41:08.502 --> 41:10.337
That's what this is.

41:15.042 --> 41:16.810
Oh, great.

41:16.844 --> 41:17.978
Voila.

41:18.012 --> 41:21.448
You are free to go as you wish.

41:21.482 --> 41:26.186
Word is you got a lot riding
on this Kane getting elected.

41:26.220 --> 41:27.888
Why didn't you run yourself?

41:27.921 --> 41:29.490
What's the number one rule
of Hawaii?

41:29.523 --> 41:31.025
Everyone's family.

41:31.058 --> 41:33.327
Everyone is family
except for us.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.297
We've been here for years
and you know what, the locals,

41:36.330 --> 41:37.931
still think of us as...

41:37.965 --> 41:40.401
As tourists, as colonizers.

41:40.434 --> 41:43.871
I can raise a fucking
mountain from the sea,

41:43.904 --> 41:47.174
name it after myself
and still...

41:47.207 --> 41:48.542
You'd still be a tourist.

41:48.575 --> 41:49.943
Still.

41:51.979 --> 41:53.414
But there is a...

41:53.447 --> 41:55.382
There is hope for these people.

41:55.416 --> 41:58.085
A lot of untapped resources.

41:58.118 --> 42:00.020
Yeah, and you'll get
quite a slice I'm sure

42:00.054 --> 42:01.455
if he gets elected, right?

42:01.488 --> 42:05.926
What's good for me,
is good for Hawaii.

42:05.959 --> 42:07.294
You must be hungry.

42:07.328 --> 42:08.462
Are you hungry?

42:08.495 --> 42:10.097
Please.

42:11.165 --> 42:12.466
Well, here.

42:16.103 --> 42:17.438
Suit yourself.

42:17.471 --> 42:20.374
You know,
my guys did some extensive

42:20.407 --> 42:23.010
background research on you.

42:23.043 --> 42:25.979
And you know what,
it was a page Turner.

42:26.013 --> 42:28.115
I... I couldn't put it down.

42:28.148 --> 42:31.018
Well, don't believe
everything you read.

42:31.051 --> 42:35.055
Mm-hm. Chicago, what about
Chicago? You left the force.

42:35.089 --> 42:36.623
A great pension. Why?

42:36.657 --> 42:38.492
Why would you do
something like that?

42:38.525 --> 42:41.228
I didn't love bein' a cop.

42:41.261 --> 42:44.932
But bounty hunting,
it's a whole different animal.

42:44.965 --> 42:47.134
There's no rules, no superiors.

42:47.167 --> 42:50.037
And I can learn a lot
about the scum I'm chasing.

42:51.705 --> 42:53.107
You know,

42:54.575 --> 42:57.578
there's a story
going around about you.

42:57.611 --> 43:01.048
Oh good. I love a good story.

43:01.081 --> 43:03.050
Especially if it's about me.

43:05.052 --> 43:09.123
You're no billionaire,
although you'd like to be.

43:09.156 --> 43:11.592
And this whole act of yours
is being bankrolled

43:11.625 --> 43:15.162
by Terrance billford
and his cartel buddies.

43:15.195 --> 43:16.597
That's what I hear.

43:19.166 --> 43:23.237
Ern, go upstairs and fire up
your video game.

43:23.270 --> 43:24.471
I'll be right up.

43:26.173 --> 43:29.176
Now, that is a good story.
Now, who is this?

43:29.209 --> 43:31.178
Who is this blifferd...
Billford...

43:31.211 --> 43:32.613
Who is this?

43:32.646 --> 43:35.182
Well, real piece of shit,
slung meth.

43:35.215 --> 43:38.218
Big time operator
back in the day though.
Made a fortune.

43:38.252 --> 43:41.221
Well, I'm sure
he didn't force people
to take drugs.

43:41.255 --> 43:43.590
If they did, it was on them.

43:45.292 --> 43:47.394
You're right to be scared.

43:47.428 --> 43:50.464
Cause it wouldn't take much for
me to blow the whistle on you.

43:50.497 --> 43:52.533
You know, see if you're running
this campaign

43:52.566 --> 43:54.201
with laundered drug money...

43:54.234 --> 43:56.670
The only thing
that I'm scared of is me.

43:56.703 --> 44:00.240
And I am me, so...

44:00.274 --> 44:02.209
There's nothing to be scared of.

44:02.242 --> 44:04.411
But what about you, Robbie?

44:04.445 --> 44:07.381
Maybe it's time that you tell me

44:07.414 --> 44:09.383
where you heard this good story

44:09.416 --> 44:12.486
and who else knows about it.

44:12.519 --> 44:14.421
And why the fuck
would I do that?

44:27.534 --> 44:28.735
Any luck?

44:28.769 --> 44:30.537
The FBI gave us this tech.

44:30.571 --> 44:32.773
It's supposed to help
reconfigure damaged data.

44:32.807 --> 44:34.775
What about water damage?

44:34.809 --> 44:36.677
We're about to find out.

44:43.283 --> 44:44.551
Here we go.

44:44.585 --> 44:46.620
Hey, let me see.

44:46.653 --> 44:48.322
They're on the beach.

44:48.355 --> 44:49.723
Do you recognize him?

44:49.756 --> 44:52.192
I can't see his face.

44:52.226 --> 44:56.663
Dad's body is bleeding heavy,
drawin' in the sharks.

44:58.833 --> 45:02.169
Fuck. He never had a chance.

45:02.202 --> 45:03.570
That's just weird.

45:03.604 --> 45:05.405
What's weird?

45:05.439 --> 45:08.509
That beach hasn't seen
a single shark attack ever.

45:08.542 --> 45:10.386
There's no access.
They get hung up on the coral.

45:10.410 --> 45:14.515
He's dead. I saw the body,
the blood tests.

45:14.548 --> 45:16.392
I think there are people
who might be able to help us.

45:16.416 --> 45:18.318
They watch over this part
of the island.

45:18.352 --> 45:20.287
A watch over?

45:20.320 --> 45:22.222
They still honor the old ways.

45:22.256 --> 45:23.624
Well, where do they live?

45:23.657 --> 45:26.393
This place buck calls
paradise city.

45:27.862 --> 45:31.665
Look, I'll take you there
if you promise

45:31.698 --> 45:33.367
you'll behave yourself.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.068
Behave myself?

45:35.102 --> 45:37.404
Uh, they're pretty touchy
about strangers.

45:45.245 --> 45:47.114
Yeah?

45:47.147 --> 45:49.383
I just saw that guy
you asked about...

45:49.416 --> 45:51.118
Swann.

45:51.151 --> 45:52.686
Where did he go?

45:52.719 --> 45:54.497
I don't know, but he's headed
to paradise city.

45:54.521 --> 45:56.123
Right, I got it.

46:03.697 --> 46:05.265
It's just beyond
these mountains.

46:05.299 --> 46:07.100
I thought you said
this was a shortcut?

46:07.134 --> 46:08.468
It is to me.

46:08.502 --> 46:10.337
Come on, it's worth it,
I promise.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.702
Oh, you're gonna walk
through there barefoot?

46:41.735 --> 46:45.372
Yup. You ought
to try it sometimes.

46:45.405 --> 46:46.773
Connects you to the earth.

46:46.808 --> 46:49.176
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty
connected to my boots.

46:49.209 --> 46:50.677
Fine, suit yourself.

46:55.515 --> 46:58.485
When I was a little girl,
we never wore shoes here.

46:58.518 --> 47:00.855
This is considered sacred land.

47:00.888 --> 47:02.656
You grew up here?

47:02.689 --> 47:06.360
Yup. My mom and her sister
raised me here when I was a kid.

47:06.393 --> 47:07.929
I never knew who my dad was.

47:07.962 --> 47:11.698
But that didn't matter,
'cause this place, the people...

47:11.732 --> 47:13.734
It's all the family
I ever needed.

47:18.705 --> 47:20.474
Are we almost there?

47:20.507 --> 47:21.675
Just few more minutes.

47:21.708 --> 47:22.944
Okay, well just give me a sec

47:22.977 --> 47:24.211
to return some of my sacred

47:24.244 --> 47:26.413
water back to the earth.

47:26.446 --> 47:28.749
Oh, shit.

47:53.875 --> 47:56.410
Holy shit!

47:56.443 --> 47:59.847
Whoa! Hey, hey guys...
Sorry, I was just ah...

47:59.881 --> 48:02.749
Shut your mouth, haole!
What you doing here?

48:02.783 --> 48:05.619
He's with me! He's with me.

48:05.652 --> 48:06.620
Savannah!

48:06.653 --> 48:07.822
Yeah.

48:07.855 --> 48:11.725
Hey! Auntie, look who's here.

48:11.758 --> 48:14.394
Savannah!

48:14.428 --> 48:17.631
My little girl,
so glad to see you.

48:17.664 --> 48:21.268
But why you bring this
smooth talking haole over here?

48:21.301 --> 48:24.538
I came to this island to find
out who killed my father.

48:24.571 --> 48:26.506
His name's Ian Swann.

48:26.540 --> 48:27.809
Is that true?

48:29.811 --> 48:31.712
You're a friend or foe?

48:31.745 --> 48:34.314
I was a fighter but yeah,
I'm feeling really peaceful

48:34.347 --> 48:35.515
looking at that Remington.

48:35.549 --> 48:36.918
Do you think you
could just ah...

48:36.951 --> 48:38.552
Yeah, that's nice. Thanks.

48:38.585 --> 48:41.254
We can always use
another fighter.

48:41.288 --> 48:43.557
But you don't try fighting
with me, okay,

48:43.590 --> 48:45.893
because you no can't win.

48:48.328 --> 48:49.730
Ah-huh-huh.

48:52.532 --> 48:56.603
Who's hungry? Let's eat.

48:56.636 --> 48:59.040
After you.

48:59.073 --> 49:00.474
No, okay. That's fine.

49:00.507 --> 49:01.976
Come on.

49:30.805 --> 49:34.075
Welcome to paliuli village.

49:34.108 --> 49:35.910
Locals call it paradise city.

49:35.943 --> 49:37.511
Lives up to the name,
don't you think?

49:37.544 --> 49:38.745
Yeah, I can see that.

49:44.886 --> 49:48.722
They're the only homestead that
refused to be bribed by buck.

49:48.755 --> 49:50.390
They're the resistance.

50:07.809 --> 50:09.709
What's he saying?

50:09.743 --> 50:12.412
He said he wants you to prove
that you're Ian Swann's son.

50:12.445 --> 50:13.780
Yeah, sure.

50:13.815 --> 50:16.483
Oh, no. Not that kind of proof.

50:16.516 --> 50:18.451
Charlie's an old school kahuna.

50:18.485 --> 50:20.453
One of the last in the islands.

50:20.487 --> 50:21.655
So, what does he want?

50:26.693 --> 50:28.795
He'd like you to sit
with him for a while.

50:28.830 --> 50:30.898
Cause he has a way
of knowing your truth.

50:35.635 --> 50:36.904
Just the boy.

50:36.938 --> 50:38.638
We can save him a plate.

51:23.117 --> 51:24.919
Do I get to ask
what's in this first?

51:24.952 --> 51:26.386
No.

51:36.931 --> 51:39.901
Ah, something tells me
these aren't portobello.

51:43.838 --> 51:45.072
Cheers.

52:18.973 --> 52:21.175
Hey, we got to restock
the whiskey.

52:36.589 --> 52:37.858
Robbie?

52:39.927 --> 52:41.228
Robbie!

52:52.706 --> 52:55.977
It's been nice.
I think I'll be going.

53:00.281 --> 53:02.950
Thanks for sharing
your stash and I uh...

53:02.984 --> 53:05.052
And I hope I passed the test.

53:05.086 --> 53:06.553
- No.
- Yeah.

53:06.586 --> 53:09.622
Be still!
Think of your father.

53:09.656 --> 53:13.861
What did he teach you,
to help you become a man.

53:13.894 --> 53:15.129
Not much.

53:15.162 --> 53:16.629
Think of something.

53:18.665 --> 53:20.533
I uh...

53:24.738 --> 53:26.673
He taught me
how to handle a gun.

53:28.742 --> 53:30.577
And after he left home,

53:30.610 --> 53:31.855
I swore
I'd never touch one again.

53:31.879 --> 53:33.914
I had to do things my way.

53:37.151 --> 53:38.853
Hey, what more proof
do you need, man?

53:38.886 --> 53:41.255
I can't just sit here.

53:41.288 --> 53:43.290
No more words.

53:43.324 --> 53:46.327
Picture him in your mind,

53:46.360 --> 53:49.529
then we'll both know
whose son you are.

54:02.176 --> 54:05.012
Go ahead, Ryan.
First, the barrel.

54:06.814 --> 54:09.150
Not that hard, go easy.

54:11.285 --> 54:14.587
I'm not like you!
I don't need to use a gun.

54:14.621 --> 54:16.290
It might save your life one day.

54:16.323 --> 54:18.926
I'm never gonna kill
anyone, ever!

54:18.959 --> 54:20.693
Ryan, pick it up.

54:20.727 --> 54:22.762
Ryan! Ryan!

54:24.798 --> 54:27.268
He is your son.
It's safe to show your face now.

54:27.301 --> 54:29.170
What the hell, Charlie?

54:29.203 --> 54:30.938
I could have told you
that myself.

54:30.971 --> 54:33.274
It's not just your life at risk
if you're found here.

54:33.307 --> 54:34.707
It's the whole settlement.

54:34.741 --> 54:36.210
How strong is this dope?

54:36.243 --> 54:38.379
Because I... um...

54:38.412 --> 54:42.183
It's me, Ryan.

54:42.216 --> 54:44.852
I wouldn't blame you
if you'd rather see me dead.

54:44.885 --> 54:46.053
You're alive?

54:46.087 --> 54:47.354
Yeah.

54:47.388 --> 54:52.159
Took a couple of bullets
but I'm fine.

54:52.193 --> 54:53.726
You listened to my message.

54:53.760 --> 54:54.829
That's a first.

54:54.862 --> 54:56.030
Is that all you can say?

54:56.063 --> 54:57.865
I... I thought you were dead.

54:57.898 --> 54:59.934
I dropped everything.
People tried to kill me.

54:59.967 --> 55:02.635
Easy, kid. Come here.

55:07.141 --> 55:08.708
I'm sorry, Ryan.

55:16.283 --> 55:18.119
Charlie,
what the hell did you do?

55:18.152 --> 55:20.421
Old style lie detector.

55:20.454 --> 55:23.257
Shit.
Better brew up some coffee.

55:23.290 --> 55:24.925
Make it strong.

55:28.863 --> 55:30.397
Your father first came to us

55:30.431 --> 55:32.867
to learn about
that evil man, buck.

55:32.900 --> 55:36.036
So, the enemy of my enemy
is my friend?
That kind of thing.

55:36.070 --> 55:40.808
More than that.
If Mr. Buck wins,
all of Hawaii loses.

55:40.841 --> 55:43.776
We helped Ian that day,
because he was helping us.

55:43.811 --> 55:45.412
They saved my life.

55:45.446 --> 55:48.048
Oh. Not just us.

55:48.082 --> 55:52.153
It was the island herself
that wanted you to win.

55:57.124 --> 56:00.961
The tide dragged him under,
away from his enemies.

56:00.995 --> 56:04.398
And we saw him
and pulled him ashore in time.

56:06.901 --> 56:09.303
But what about that body
they showed me at the morgue?

56:09.336 --> 56:13.107
It was a drowning victim,
borrowed from the morgue.

56:13.140 --> 56:15.409
- Sorry.
- Yeah, but why?

56:15.442 --> 56:17.244
I needed buck to think
I was dead

56:17.278 --> 56:19.346
at least 'till I got back
on my feet.

56:19.380 --> 56:21.348
You said you had evidence
on Terrance.

56:21.382 --> 56:23.184
I did.

56:23.217 --> 56:25.386
And his trail led me to buck.

56:25.419 --> 56:27.154
I had all the proof I needed.

56:27.188 --> 56:29.190
Yeah, whatever you had,
your intel is long gone.

56:29.223 --> 56:31.091
I figured that.

56:31.125 --> 56:33.060
I had a backup on my cell phone.

56:33.093 --> 56:36.063
That's somewhere
under Honolulu bay.

56:36.096 --> 56:38.165
Well, maybe not.

56:41.235 --> 56:43.736
That's a hell of a trick.

56:45.506 --> 56:48.375
Now, let me show you a trick
Terrance played on all of us.

56:48.409 --> 56:51.278
I got these from a surgeon
who lost his license,

56:51.312 --> 56:53.047
working for the cartel.

56:55.249 --> 56:59.853
Holy shit!
So, Terrance is buck!

56:59.887 --> 57:02.122
The devil may change his face,

57:02.156 --> 57:04.358
but the spirit of evil
is the same.

57:04.391 --> 57:06.360
So, that day at the cove?

57:10.164 --> 57:13.500
I had buck in custody
and proof that he was Terrance.

57:13.534 --> 57:15.802
And it all went off the rails.

57:29.216 --> 57:31.819
So, what we're dealing with
is more than just a land grab

57:31.852 --> 57:33.454
by some dirty politicians?

57:33.487 --> 57:35.990
I mean,
buck is a stone-cold killer.

57:36.023 --> 57:37.790
He's tied to the cartels.

57:37.825 --> 57:40.227
He'll strip mine the land
and make Maui

57:40.261 --> 57:42.963
the international drug port.

57:42.997 --> 57:45.065
That's what they dream of.

57:45.099 --> 57:48.502
Oh, wait. It's Nikki. Hey.

57:48.535 --> 57:51.805
<i>Robbie...</i>

57:51.839 --> 57:54.008
What? Okay, okay.

57:54.041 --> 57:55.843
Look, whatever we do,
we better do it fast.

57:55.876 --> 57:57.578
Robbie's being held
at the golden throne.

57:57.611 --> 57:59.146
What's the golden throne?

57:59.179 --> 58:00.447
Buck's own little kingdom

58:00.481 --> 58:02.082
isolated on the far side
of the island.

58:02.116 --> 58:03.884
Well, we've gotta get
Robbie out.

58:03.917 --> 58:06.086
It's not that easy.
He built it like a fortress.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.988
That's good.
They'll never see us comin'.

58:08.022 --> 58:11.158
There is no us.
I do this on my own.

58:11.191 --> 58:13.303
Yeah, isn't that how you
started this mess on your own?

58:13.327 --> 58:14.528
Look, like it or not, dad,

58:14.561 --> 58:16.096
I'm pretty fucking good
on my job.

58:16.130 --> 58:17.865
That's not the point.

58:17.898 --> 58:20.167
Yeah, maybe this is.
I am going to golden throne.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.468
I'm getting Robbie out

58:21.502 --> 58:23.037
and you can either come
and help me,

58:23.070 --> 58:24.872
or you can stay here eating poi.

58:24.905 --> 58:26.583
Hey, we all need to calm down
try to work together.

58:26.607 --> 58:29.376
Or Robbie's gonna end up dead
if he's not dead already, okay?

58:29.410 --> 58:31.011
You're right.

58:31.045 --> 58:32.422
She's smarter
than your last girlfriend.

58:32.446 --> 58:34.315
She's not my girlfriend.

58:34.348 --> 58:36.216
Not with that attitude.

58:38.385 --> 58:41.488
We're loading up the truck
to get you guys back in to town.

58:41.522 --> 58:44.024
May your journey be a safe one.

58:44.058 --> 58:45.192
Thank you.

58:46.560 --> 58:47.995
Come on.

58:51.965 --> 58:53.233
I love you, auntie.

59:02.976 --> 59:04.378
Thank you, auntie.

59:14.688 --> 59:17.424
I'm so worried for them.

59:17.458 --> 59:21.462
Maybe they have a chance, maybe.

59:21.495 --> 59:23.931
I'm sending them
a blessing of protection.

59:31.672 --> 59:33.273
Auntie, let's go!

59:33.307 --> 59:35.175
We must get the kids
to the school house.

59:48.655 --> 59:50.057
I know who you are!

59:50.090 --> 59:53.127
Just a coward with a bullet.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.528
That bullet for me?

59:58.365 --> 59:59.500
Burn this place down.

01:00:24.491 --> 01:00:27.227
Hey, check it out.

01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:29.229
The shit just got deeper.

01:00:29.263 --> 01:00:31.965
<i>Hawaii has suffered
yet another tragedy.</i>

01:00:31.999 --> 01:00:34.735
<i>The ninth reservation,
sacred home land territory,</i>

01:00:34.768 --> 01:00:38.539
<i>has been claimed by a fire
from faulty gas storage tanks.</i>

01:00:38.572 --> 01:00:40.174
No!

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:43.577
<i>Part of the territory.</i>

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.379
<i>Six lives have been lost</i>

01:00:45.412 --> 01:00:47.347
<i>with at least
two dozen reported injured.</i>

01:00:47.381 --> 01:00:49.216
To the ninth.

01:00:49.249 --> 01:00:51.518
<i>A hui hou kakou.</i>

01:00:51.552 --> 01:00:53.454
Until we meet again.

01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:56.056
<i>Hui hou kakou.</i>

01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:58.559
Gas tank fire!
This is bullshit!

01:00:58.592 --> 01:01:00.194
We have no way to prove that.

01:01:00.227 --> 01:01:01.595
We don't have to prove it.

01:01:01.628 --> 01:01:03.397
You gotta Jack it
on Terrance billford

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.432
and proof he's buck.
That's all the proof we need.

01:01:05.466 --> 01:01:10.137
No. Not after a hit like that,
they'll be ready for anything.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.672
I know a guy
who can get both of you

01:01:11.705 --> 01:01:13.640
to a safe place in Bali.

01:01:13.674 --> 01:01:15.709
Yeah, we wish you could get
rid of us that easy.

01:01:15.742 --> 01:01:17.478
Let's think about this.

01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:20.280
Buck will be busy
throwing a big victory party

01:01:20.314 --> 01:01:21.715
tomorrow for his donors.

01:01:21.748 --> 01:01:23.317
There's too many eyes on there.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.018
No, no, no, no.
She's onto something.

01:01:25.052 --> 01:01:27.688
Maybe we can uh,
we can trojan horse our way in.

01:01:27.721 --> 01:01:29.423
It would be the last night
he expects.

01:01:29.456 --> 01:01:32.059
You get buck,
we get Robbie out alive.

01:01:34.228 --> 01:01:35.329
Your call, kid.

01:01:37.798 --> 01:01:39.032
You still in?

01:01:52.346 --> 01:01:53.714
Are you ready for this?

01:01:53.747 --> 01:01:55.349
If Robbie's in there,
we'll find him.

01:01:55.382 --> 01:01:58.585
You got 30 minutes.
After that, get out.

01:01:58.619 --> 01:02:00.354
It'll get ugly
when I take buck down

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:01.488
when we take him down.

01:02:01.522 --> 01:02:03.156
Just get Robbie out safe.

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:04.558
I'll take care of the rest.

01:02:06.793 --> 01:02:09.162
Hey, don't mind him.

01:02:09.196 --> 01:02:10.497
He still think he's in charge.

01:02:26.747 --> 01:02:28.215
<i>♪ Come on ♪</i>

01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:35.622

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:52.272
Check for any sign of Robbie,
okay?

01:02:52.306 --> 01:02:53.540
Bye.

01:02:57.411 --> 01:02:59.379
Drivers wait in the back.

01:02:59.413 --> 01:03:01.773
Well, I'm their security. They
don't go anywhere without me.

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:04.594
You know, I'm pretty sure
your boss will be pissed

01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:06.153
if the girls leave.

01:03:07.922 --> 01:03:09.156
Stay right here.

01:03:09.189 --> 01:03:10.457
Yeah.

<i>♪ And the base

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:31.578
Oh, we should definitely.
He's going live. Take a look.

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.792
<i>I wanna thank the great people

<i>And thank you so much.</i>

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.304
<i>Off to Washington!</i>

01:03:58.973 --> 01:04:01.341
You got your boy in office,
Terrance.

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:03.210
You sure he's gonna play ball?

01:04:03.243 --> 01:04:06.279
He has no choice.
Don't ever call me Terrance.

01:04:06.313 --> 01:04:08.448
He's dead, he's gone.

01:04:08.482 --> 01:04:10.217
I'll call you whatever you like.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.728
As long as can move
the type of volume

01:04:11.752 --> 01:04:13.453
you're talking about.

01:04:13.487 --> 01:04:15.355
As a matter of fact,

01:04:15.389 --> 01:04:18.592
I feel a little placed out
here myself you know, post op.

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:20.560
Well, if you're serious
about that,

01:04:20.594 --> 01:04:23.330
you have to acquire a piece
of property that you...

01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:25.198
You might be interested in.

01:04:25.232 --> 01:04:26.733
Everybody, raise your glasses.

01:04:26.767 --> 01:04:28.669
A toast to senator Kane.

01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:30.203
And the new Maui,

01:04:30.237 --> 01:04:33.373
which I have officially
renamed "heaven",

01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:37.244
because from now on
everybody's wishes come true.

01:04:37.277 --> 01:04:39.446
Cheers!

01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:43.818
Don't you ever doubt me,
mother fucker.

01:04:51.558 --> 01:04:52.759
Thanks.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:59.466
Hello, car door boy.

01:04:59.499 --> 01:05:00.811
My ears are still ringing
from that time you

01:05:00.835 --> 01:05:02.402
smack me in the head...

01:05:02.436 --> 01:05:03.881
Yeah, as I recall,
you ran into my car,

01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:05.439
not vice versa.

01:05:05.472 --> 01:05:06.707
Yeah.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.975
Nice get-up.

01:05:11.344 --> 01:05:13.613
You think this shit
will fool anybody?

01:05:13.647 --> 01:05:15.549
Your about to get your ass
killed in here.

01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:17.819
Now, I thought
they had you locked up.

01:05:17.852 --> 01:05:19.753
Guess they let
all the animals out, huh?

01:05:19.786 --> 01:05:22.789
Buck pulled some strings,
charges were dropped.

01:05:22.824 --> 01:05:25.993
Buck holds more power over
these islands than anyone.

01:05:26.027 --> 01:05:27.895
And with the fall
of paradise city,

01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:29.763
there's no one left
to keep him in check.

01:05:29.796 --> 01:05:31.631
Am I right?

01:05:31.665 --> 01:05:36.003
Some of the best people
on this island... motherfuckers!

01:05:36.037 --> 01:05:38.271
You don't seem too happy
about your boss's success.

01:05:38.305 --> 01:05:39.706
He's not my boss!

01:05:41.475 --> 01:05:45.012
I had family in paliuli, okay?

01:05:45.046 --> 01:05:47.481
He's sure as fuck not my boss.

01:05:47.514 --> 01:05:50.751
You know it was no accident.

01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:54.021
Buck's try to run them
off their homestead.

01:05:54.055 --> 01:05:56.858
If you're here
to give buck a headache,

01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:58.692
I wouldn't say no
to your helping out.

01:05:58.725 --> 01:06:00.727
And I wouldn't say no
to your help.

01:06:04.031 --> 01:06:08.335
They're holding Robbie Cole
somewhere on this property.

01:06:08.368 --> 01:06:09.736
If Robbie's alive,

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:11.705
he'll be somewhere
in the underground.

01:06:11.738 --> 01:06:13.750
The word is buck built tunnels
underneath the property.

01:06:13.774 --> 01:06:15.442
Do you know where?

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:17.879
I can take a look around.

01:06:17.912 --> 01:06:20.047
I'll get caught
if I'm seen with you.

01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:25.352
Give me a few minutes,
I'll meet you back here.

01:07:24.778 --> 01:07:28.115
Hey, this is a private party.

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:32.086
What the hell...

01:07:33.855 --> 01:07:35.156
Swann's kid.

01:07:55.475 --> 01:07:57.144
Die, haole...

01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:20.100
Come on! Let's go, Savannah.

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:25.973
Come on, come on!

01:08:30.912 --> 01:08:32.444
Come on...

01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:39.586
My god, you think he'll drown?

01:08:39.618 --> 01:08:42.156
If we're lucky. Come on.

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.629
I thought you guys were playing
on the down low. Not brawling.

01:08:44.658 --> 01:08:46.626
Your pal manu didn't give me
much of a choice.

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:47.962
This way, you guys, come on.

01:08:51.731 --> 01:08:53.566
Guys, they know who we are now.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.078
I have to warn Nikki and
the others they are in danger.

01:08:55.102 --> 01:08:56.736
Meet us on the north end
of the property.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.772
Koa and I will take
a last look for Robbie.

01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:01.075
- Be careful, alright?
- Okay.

01:09:01.108 --> 01:09:03.643
This door leads to a part
of the property they keep
off-limits.

01:09:03.676 --> 01:09:04.854
I've seen zyatt go
from this door

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.198
and literally disappear
for hours.

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:11.051
Okay. Hey, hey,
let's try this the easy way.

01:09:13.988 --> 01:09:15.488
Move, haole!

01:09:23.662 --> 01:09:24.932
Hold it!

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.709
What are you waiting for,
Christmas?

01:09:35.742 --> 01:09:37.510
How did you get down here?

01:09:37.544 --> 01:09:39.080
Tunnels under the house.

01:09:39.113 --> 01:09:41.916
Cowards always leave a way out.

01:09:41.948 --> 01:09:43.716
You make a friend?

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.853
I'm a friend
of this island, sir.

01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:47.121
I've heard you were too.

01:09:47.154 --> 01:09:50.557
Good for you. Let's move.

01:10:01.568 --> 01:10:03.904
Keep moving. Look at your six.

01:10:22.356 --> 01:10:24.591
Oh, shit.

01:10:31.032 --> 01:10:32.732
We're too late.

01:10:36.803 --> 01:10:38.939
If you'd shown up
a few hours ago,

01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:40.250
you could have watched him
jump start me

01:10:40.274 --> 01:10:42.977
with that fucking car battery.

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.245
You wanna give me a hand here?

01:10:44.278 --> 01:10:45.980
Oh, I got it, Robbie.

01:10:54.121 --> 01:10:57.058
Koa, what are you doing here?

01:10:57.091 --> 01:10:58.926
He's a mutual friend.

01:11:01.062 --> 01:11:02.830
Ian!

01:11:02.863 --> 01:11:05.199
Jesus, you're still alive.

01:11:05.232 --> 01:11:07.868
You too.
Like an old cockroach.

01:11:07.902 --> 01:11:09.736
Can you still walk?

01:11:09.769 --> 01:11:12.672
I should be asking you
that question, old man.

01:11:12.705 --> 01:11:14.607
I swore the next time I saw you,

01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:16.743
I'd punch you
in the fucking face.

01:11:16.776 --> 01:11:18.946
Wait, how did you manage
to stay alive down here?

01:11:18.979 --> 01:11:22.615
Told buck I had proof,
billford was funding him.

01:11:22.649 --> 01:11:24.018
Took a wild guess.

01:11:24.051 --> 01:11:25.886
You're wrong just like usual.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.088
Buck is billford.

01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:28.255
What the fuck?

01:11:28.289 --> 01:11:29.857
You're always bullshitting me.

01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:32.659
Shut up, Robbie.
Or I'll tie you back up.

01:11:32.692 --> 01:11:35.262
Will you guys please shut up?

01:11:35.296 --> 01:11:36.964
Now, dad I get it.

01:11:36.997 --> 01:11:38.375
That he hooked up with mom
on Thanksgiving.

01:11:38.399 --> 01:11:40.367
Get over it.

01:11:40.401 --> 01:11:43.736
And you, apologize.

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:45.638
I have apologized.

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.845
Ian, I'm sorry man.

01:11:50.878 --> 01:11:53.247
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.747
I want that in writing.

01:11:54.781 --> 01:11:57.650
I... I can't take this.

01:11:57.684 --> 01:11:59.652
Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.230
Do you even know
where you're going?

01:12:09.263 --> 01:12:10.697
Keep moving.

01:12:13.234 --> 01:12:15.136
<i>Shots been reported
in the basement.</i>

01:12:35.055 --> 01:12:36.723
Robbie Cole escaped.

01:12:36.756 --> 01:12:38.826
Make sure he's dead
before he leaves this property.

01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:41.095
You heard him, boys.
Hunt to kill.

01:12:41.128 --> 01:12:43.364
Get the boat.
I'll get my son.

01:12:43.397 --> 01:12:44.941
What the hell is going
on here, Terrance?

01:12:44.965 --> 01:12:46.433
Calm down.
It's being taken care of.

01:12:46.467 --> 01:12:48.169
I thought
you had this gangland bullshit

01:12:48.202 --> 01:12:50.271
under control, Terrance!

01:12:57.978 --> 01:13:01.215
Come on! This way!
This way, this way.

01:13:01.248 --> 01:13:05.019
Come on. Come on.
Stay low. Stay low. Come on.

01:13:05.052 --> 01:13:07.288
Go, go, go!

01:13:16.864 --> 01:13:18.465
Hey, man,
I'm just looking for valet.

01:13:18.499 --> 01:13:21.068
Don't shoot the guests.
Come on! Let's go. Come on.

01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:39.253
You alright?

01:13:43.857 --> 01:13:45.926
Alright, you guys go first.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.128
We're gonna lay down
some cover fire. Okay?

01:13:48.162 --> 01:13:49.897
- Move fast, stay low.
- Alright.

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.132
Alright. One, two... now!

01:14:02.409 --> 01:14:04.044
Better reload.

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:05.813
Okay. I get the two on the left.

01:14:05.846 --> 01:14:07.548
I got the two on the right.

01:14:07.581 --> 01:14:08.916
What about the guy
in the middle?

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:11.151
Dealer's choice.

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:12.386
Now!

01:14:18.993 --> 01:14:20.027
Come on!

01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:32.439
Zyatt Dean!

01:14:32.473 --> 01:14:34.875
Hands where I can see them.

01:14:34.908 --> 01:14:37.144
On your knees now!

01:14:37.177 --> 01:14:39.480
Make a move
and I won't hesitate.

01:14:39.513 --> 01:14:41.882
I got 20 armed men out there.

01:14:41.915 --> 01:14:43.284
What do you think
you're gonna do?

01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:44.561
Arrest me and walk
out of here alive?

01:14:44.585 --> 01:14:46.453
Who said anything about
arresting you?

01:14:46.487 --> 01:14:49.323
If I shoot you,
it's self-defense.

01:14:49.356 --> 01:14:51.892
And the world
becomes a better place.

01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:54.328
Now, drop the bag
and keep your hands

01:14:54.361 --> 01:14:55.963
where I can see them.

01:15:01.935 --> 01:15:04.004
That wasn't so tough, was it?

01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:10.477
Don't try it! No!

01:15:28.095 --> 01:15:29.863
Where's the boat?

01:15:29.897 --> 01:15:31.897
Boat's coming. Just off
that point in five minutes.

01:15:33.967 --> 01:15:36.370
Hey, game's over!
Drop your weapons.

01:15:36.403 --> 01:15:39.606
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.378
Koa!

01:16:01.028 --> 01:16:02.229
Where are we going, dad?

01:16:02.262 --> 01:16:04.565
Well son, someplace new.

01:16:04.598 --> 01:16:07.067
You think of it...
Think of it as an adventure.

01:16:07.101 --> 01:16:08.635
And don't you worry
about anything.

01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:10.270
Hello, Terrance.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.409
Sorry, did I shock you?

01:16:15.442 --> 01:16:18.078
Drop the gun.

01:16:18.112 --> 01:16:20.013
Drop the gun, now!

01:16:20.047 --> 01:16:21.515
You piece of shit.

01:16:21.548 --> 01:16:23.484
Are you too stupid to die?

01:16:23.517 --> 01:16:26.220
You've been chasing me
for ten years. For what?

01:16:26.253 --> 01:16:28.122
I'm a little ocd.

01:16:28.155 --> 01:16:29.656
I gotta finish what I start.

01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:33.093
I gotta admit,
changing your face threw me off.

01:16:33.127 --> 01:16:36.997
Once I had your prints,
I knew I had you.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.536
I have no idea who this is.

01:16:46.607 --> 01:16:48.375
I'm taking you in.

01:16:48.409 --> 01:16:50.210
No, I got other plans.

01:16:53.247 --> 01:16:54.982
And what are you gonna do?

01:16:55.015 --> 01:16:56.526
What are you gonna shoot me
in front of my son?

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:58.252
Doesn't need to get messy.

01:16:58.285 --> 01:17:00.320
Just tell the boy to step aside.

01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:03.123
You go, son.
You go to the boat,
I'll be right behind you.

01:17:04.425 --> 01:17:05.726
- No.
- No, no...

01:17:05.759 --> 01:17:07.070
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

01:17:07.094 --> 01:17:08.395
You go.

01:17:08.429 --> 01:17:10.364
I got him covered,
he's not gonna hurt you.

01:17:10.397 --> 01:17:13.600
Your dad's right.
I won't hurt you.

01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:17.271
But he already has.
Worse than you know.

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:19.006
Don't you listen to him.

01:17:19.039 --> 01:17:21.675
Did he ever tell you
how your mom died?

01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:23.644
They found his prints
on her throat.

01:17:23.677 --> 01:17:25.279
He's a fucking liar.

01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:28.348
She threatened to leave
and take you with her.

01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:31.118
He killed her,
changed your names,

01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:32.686
stayed on the run.

01:17:32.719 --> 01:17:34.555
Don't listen to him.
Just don't listen to him.

01:17:34.588 --> 01:17:36.990
Sorry kid, it's true.

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:41.128
Go to the boat!
Just go to the boat. Go!

01:17:43.096 --> 01:17:44.364
No.

01:17:54.174 --> 01:17:55.442
Ern!

01:18:00.815 --> 01:18:03.150
- Come here. You're safe.
- Come on!

01:18:03.183 --> 01:18:04.823
- You're safe. You're safe.
- Here you go.

01:18:09.389 --> 01:18:12.326
Dad! Dad! Come on.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.634
Dad.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:22.202
Just let me be.

01:18:30.177 --> 01:18:31.612
Get down!

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.089
- Fuck!
- No, no, don't move.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.663
Don't let that bastard
run again.

01:18:49.696 --> 01:18:51.498
Take the shot for me.

01:18:56.236 --> 01:18:57.571
Take the shot.

01:19:00.207 --> 01:19:02.075
He's almost out of range.

01:19:04.545 --> 01:19:05.813
Take it!

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:12.820
Kill him, Ryan!

01:19:12.854 --> 01:19:15.122
I said I'd bring him in.

01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:39.580
Dad? Dad! Dad!

01:19:45.619 --> 01:19:48.655
He's gone. He's gone.

01:19:50.858 --> 01:19:52.626
Come on.

01:19:52.659 --> 01:19:54.261
Get up.

01:20:06.908 --> 01:20:08.642
Sergeant.

01:20:08.675 --> 01:20:11.778
Savannah, what in god's name
is going on here?

01:20:11.813 --> 01:20:15.549
Mr. Arlene Buckley is not
who he pretends to be.

01:20:51.551 --> 01:20:52.920
How you doing?

01:20:56.556 --> 01:20:58.325
Dad will be proud of you.

01:21:00.494 --> 01:21:01.728
I'm proud of you too.

01:21:30.424 --> 01:21:34.996
A blessing, to all our friends,
both old and new.

01:21:35.029 --> 01:21:38.900
You are a part
of paliuli village now.

01:21:38.933 --> 01:21:42.335
Today, we honor those
who gave their lives

01:21:42.369 --> 01:21:43.971
to protect us.

01:21:44.005 --> 01:21:47.909
Our beloved kahuna Charlie,

01:21:47.942 --> 01:21:50.544
the young warrior koa,

01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:52.479
and your father, young Swann.

01:21:52.512 --> 01:21:55.449
May he live on
through your good deeds.

01:21:55.482 --> 01:21:58.618
For donating your share
of the bounty

01:21:58.652 --> 01:22:00.754
so we can rebuild our village

01:22:00.787 --> 01:22:04.558
and care for the families
of the victims.

01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:07.327
We are all in your debt.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.763
- Mahalo.
- Mahalo.

01:22:13.034 --> 01:22:15.368
You did that, Ryan?

01:22:15.402 --> 01:22:18.405
Ah, it just felt like
the right thing to do.

01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:20.340
I mean, I kept 10%.

01:22:20.373 --> 01:22:22.442
Leaves me enough
for a new start.

01:22:22.476 --> 01:22:23.911
But what about you?

01:22:23.945 --> 01:22:25.980
You okay now
after all we've been through.

01:22:26.013 --> 01:22:29.716
I'm a little shook up
but every time I come back here

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.785
I just feel at peace.

01:22:31.819 --> 01:22:35.689
At least buck can't terrorize
anyone anymore.

01:22:35.722 --> 01:22:40.962
So, now that this is all over,
are you and I still friends?

01:22:40.995 --> 01:22:45.032
Well, that would be boring,
wouldn't it?

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:04.785
Ah, shall we?
