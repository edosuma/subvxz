WEBVTT

00:00.281 --> 00:01.894
You're sure we're not
just hiding out here?

00:01.943 --> 00:03.843
- Avoiding going back?
- I owe her.

00:03.892 --> 00:05.710
- What's your name, ma'am?
- Marlene Loddington.

00:05.759 --> 00:07.383
Your relationship to these children?

00:07.432 --> 00:09.375
I'm True's biological grandmother,

00:09.451 --> 00:12.302
and I would like to petition
for full custody.

00:12.351 --> 00:14.036
- Everything OK?
- Just my roommate

00:14.085 --> 00:15.833
didn't come home last night.
She's gone dark on me,

00:15.882 --> 00:17.078
and that isn't really like her.

00:17.127 --> 00:18.654
Crystal hooks for that gang.

00:18.703 --> 00:20.710
Maddie hid her involvement from me,

00:20.759 --> 00:22.078
and then they jumped her in

00:22.127 --> 00:23.270
I took her to the hospital.

00:23.319 --> 00:26.249
They started accusing me
as if I could...

00:26.460 --> 00:28.740
ever to my... my own kid.

00:28.789 --> 00:30.429
There were drugs in the house, Joanna.

00:30.477 --> 00:33.270
The presence of drugs further
proves that she isn't using,

00:33.347 --> 00:34.664
and someone is setting her up.

00:34.713 --> 00:36.804
I'm saying the evidence is mounting
against her.

00:36.853 --> 00:37.963
Ms. Chartrand,

00:38.012 --> 00:39.703
you tested positive for cocaine.

00:39.752 --> 00:40.952
No, that's not possible.

00:41.001 --> 00:42.961
For the first time
since we've been together...

00:43.009 --> 00:44.492
You're worried, about the firm

00:44.541 --> 00:45.842
or about the relationship?

00:45.891 --> 00:48.352
If we have any chance of winning this,

00:48.401 --> 00:50.124
we have to be on the same page.

00:50.173 --> 00:51.550
We are.

00:52.214 --> 00:54.081
Then let's do this.

00:57.449 --> 01:00.150
Hello? Hello?

01:00.300 --> 01:01.476
Come in.

01:01.525 --> 01:03.794
Special delivery for Ms.
Unicorn Munchkin!

01:03.843 --> 01:04.956
- Is she here?
- Hello.

01:05.006 --> 01:07.192
Oh, hello! Here's these flowers.

01:07.447 --> 01:09.765
Ooh! Ah! Ah!

01:09.814 --> 01:11.608
It's stuck on my hand! Oh no!

01:11.657 --> 01:12.679
You can keep them.

01:12.733 --> 01:14.898
What?! No, I must deliver.

01:14.947 --> 01:16.421
Oh no.

01:16.470 --> 01:17.769
It's OK.

01:18.935 --> 01:20.869
Where did you get this?

01:21.293 --> 01:24.960
Marlene gave it to her.
I told her to keep mine.

01:25.147 --> 01:26.601
I don't need to be saved.

01:27.758 --> 01:30.786
Too bad nobody could save you
from this new hairdo.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.297
Five-minute warning.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.253
Sorry.

01:41.094 --> 01:43.203
Our client has 15 more minutes.

01:43.252 --> 01:45.250
The custodial guardian
has to end early,

01:45.299 --> 01:47.233
- she has a long drive.
- I don't care.

01:47.468 --> 01:49.268
I'm just the messenger, sorry.

01:49.329 --> 01:51.256
No. 15 minutes doesn't constitute

01:51.305 --> 01:52.969
undue hardship,
therefore it cannot impact

01:53.018 --> 01:54.423
my clients' guaranteed rights.

01:54.472 --> 01:56.634
She doesn't have any rights.

01:56.797 --> 01:58.463
I mean, not technically.

01:58.512 --> 02:00.232
Parents don't have the right
to see their children.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.526
Children have the right
to see their parents.

02:02.716 --> 02:04.469
How can we fix this?

02:04.999 --> 02:07.421
I don't know.

02:08.032 --> 02:10.178
Try to facilitate a smooth transition.

02:10.227 --> 02:12.016
You know, this is really hard
on the kids.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.571
But for next time, how do we ensure

02:13.620 --> 02:14.962
our client gets the full hour?

02:16.730 --> 02:19.833
You... could challenge the guardian.

02:20.496 --> 02:23.498
- Based on proximity?
- Based on fitness, I guess.

02:23.547 --> 02:24.868
But it's basically hopeless,

02:24.917 --> 02:28.021
since the judge already
ruled in her favour.

02:31.591 --> 02:35.093
Alright, last hugs. Time to go home.

02:37.087 --> 02:39.783
Uh, she means Grandma's house.

02:39.832 --> 02:41.306
Are you an idiot?
Why would you say that?

02:41.355 --> 02:42.384
I'm... I'm so sorry.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.321
- I didn't mean to...
- Screw it. I'm not leaving.

02:44.370 --> 02:46.439
Please, don't make me
have you be removed,

02:46.488 --> 02:48.479
by force, in front of your kids.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.321
Kodie...

02:54.920 --> 02:56.975
It's OK. It's OK.

02:57.137 --> 02:59.171
Yeah, come on.

03:02.543 --> 03:04.556
I'm going to fix this.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.756 --> 03:19.569
We get those discovery docs?

03:19.618 --> 03:21.357
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't we be getting on that?

03:21.406 --> 03:24.174
- You should see this first.
- No one notices.

03:24.885 --> 03:27.324
It's OK for a mom to forget
to pack my lunch,

03:27.373 --> 03:29.901
but there was
nothing in the fridge either,

03:29.950 --> 03:31.506
so I couldn't make my own.

03:31.555 --> 03:33.357
She posted it almost two years ago,

03:33.406 --> 03:35.381
some kind of video diary.

03:35.430 --> 03:37.634
- No one did anything about this?
- No.

03:37.683 --> 03:40.170
So much crap on the Internet,
it's a needle in a haystack.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.045
- I'll say more later.
- Maddie, let's go!

03:42.783 --> 03:44.409
We should start ploughing
through those docs.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.501
It's really more of a light shovelling.

03:47.607 --> 03:49.636
On the upside, Marlene isn't perfect,

03:49.685 --> 03:51.818
but on paper, she's a hell
of a lot better than Kodie.

03:51.878 --> 03:53.878
So, she just gets to swoop in

03:53.927 --> 03:55.206
and take someone else's kids?

03:55.255 --> 03:58.876
MFS only has to prove a
probability of harm to act.

03:59.483 --> 04:01.628
"July 21st,"

04:01.788 --> 04:04.289
that's the night Kodie's kids
were apprehended.

04:04.409 --> 04:07.589
Neighbour telephone report...

04:07.638 --> 04:09.480
"two children left alone
for several hours."

04:09.529 --> 04:11.269
"They then wandered
on to his property."

04:11.318 --> 04:13.253
uh, July 15th, same neighbour,

04:13.302 --> 04:16.120
"8:20 p.m. Heard screaming
coming from the house,"

04:16.168 --> 04:20.016
"and this went on until
the mother arrived at 8:45 p.m."

04:22.307 --> 04:24.410
This same guy...

04:24.459 --> 04:26.527
has seven other complaints against her.

04:26.576 --> 04:28.260
This watchdog have a name?

04:29.137 --> 04:31.837
"Anonymous neighbour, male."

04:34.202 --> 04:36.203
We're finding this coward, let's go.

04:42.715 --> 04:44.449
He can see her house
from his front yard.

04:46.345 --> 04:48.146
Classy.

04:53.670 --> 04:55.604
Let's just come back.

04:59.092 --> 05:01.760
Hey, Lucky! What are the odds?

05:05.665 --> 05:07.666
My father.

05:24.056 --> 05:25.490
Hi! Kodie!

05:29.375 --> 05:31.349
Hi, I'm Luna.

05:31.725 --> 05:33.859
So what? You're like
my babysitter for the day?

05:33.985 --> 05:36.785
Uhhh... think of me more
like your chauffeur.

05:38.564 --> 05:40.632
Are you the one who went to jail?

05:42.121 --> 05:44.193
Must be tougher than you look.

05:44.404 --> 05:46.440
Have to be to work for Joanna.

05:46.507 --> 05:48.552
- What does that mean?
- Don't get me wrong,

05:48.640 --> 05:51.035
I love her, but even back
in grade school,

05:51.084 --> 05:52.701
that girl was wicked competitive.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.616
And that's what makes her
a great lawyer.

05:54.665 --> 05:56.965
Hmm. And a tough boss?

05:57.050 --> 05:59.536
No comment.

05:59.873 --> 06:01.739
Uh, the car's over here.

06:01.788 --> 06:04.395
I brought some water
and snacks, VIP service.

06:04.578 --> 06:06.878
More like former junkie
whose lawyer doesn't trust her

06:06.927 --> 06:08.969
to show up clean for her drug test?

06:09.069 --> 06:12.173
Maybe, but VIP sounds better.

06:14.992 --> 06:17.755
Thought you were living in
that trailer park up by Fox Hill.

06:17.804 --> 06:19.407
Nah, I had to move a few months ago

06:19.456 --> 06:20.681
after the city condemned the place.

06:20.730 --> 06:21.804
I tried to reach you.

06:21.908 --> 06:24.275
- You sure you don't want a beer?
- We're good.

06:24.411 --> 06:26.293
Yeah, I'm OK.

06:26.815 --> 06:29.249
- It's 10 a.m.
- I'm retired.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.283
Let's sit down.

06:32.241 --> 06:33.905
So, what will I drink to?

06:35.476 --> 06:37.697
This isn't a social call,
we're here on business.

06:37.746 --> 06:39.179
We're here about the reports you made,

06:39.228 --> 06:41.374
to Millwood Family Services
about Kodie Chartrand.

06:41.423 --> 06:42.465
Who?

06:42.514 --> 06:44.530
We have a file
containing multiple reports

06:44.579 --> 06:45.765
from an anonymous neighbour.

06:45.814 --> 06:46.946
I'm not the only neighbour.

06:46.995 --> 06:48.695
Well, you're the only
anonymous male that can see

06:48.744 --> 06:50.652
directly into her house.

06:50.876 --> 06:52.753
OK, it was me.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.663
But those kids ran roughshod
all over my property.

06:55.712 --> 06:57.779
- And how old is her oldest?
- 12.

06:57.978 --> 07:00.640
Only a Chartrand would leave a
12-year-old to babysit alone all day.

07:00.689 --> 07:01.977
You ever hear of Wendy?

07:02.278 --> 07:04.312
Billy? Shane?

07:06.155 --> 07:07.940
Times were different.

07:08.092 --> 07:09.917
Also, that social-worker
lady seemed worried

07:09.966 --> 07:11.781
that something
would happen to those kids,

07:11.830 --> 07:13.487
so I said I'd keep an eye out.

07:13.613 --> 07:15.780
The social worker,
did she leave you a card?

07:16.280 --> 07:17.608
Was she a young woman?

07:17.657 --> 07:20.425
Closer to my age, but well preserved.

07:25.705 --> 07:28.073
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's her.

07:31.105 --> 07:32.939
How much did she pay you?

07:34.042 --> 07:36.709
You better leave.

07:36.803 --> 07:38.858
We're not leaving
until we have an affidavit

07:38.907 --> 07:40.617
saying you were paid to
rat out your neighbour.

07:40.666 --> 07:41.773
Mr. Crawford, if you...

07:41.822 --> 07:43.310
"Mr. Crawford"?

07:44.483 --> 07:46.277
Don't patronize me.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.843
An innocent woman
had her children taken away.

07:49.055 --> 07:52.330
Now, just give us your statement
and we can get them back.

07:53.977 --> 07:55.978
I'll talk if she moves.

08:01.946 --> 08:04.194
What, you can't make up your own mind?

08:05.850 --> 08:08.213
I'm gonna go to Kodie's,

08:08.300 --> 08:10.367
see if we missed anything.

09:04.826 --> 09:06.794
Don't tell me you don't want one.

09:11.315 --> 09:13.036
So, the affidavit.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.585
I write it up,
you just have to sign it.

09:15.653 --> 09:16.926
You been to see your brother?

09:16.975 --> 09:18.302
Twice a week, religiously.

09:18.452 --> 09:19.910
Good boy.

09:20.311 --> 09:22.590
You know, your sister stops by
from time to time.

09:22.693 --> 09:24.121
She brings me a casserole.

09:24.211 --> 09:26.211
You know, the one with the chips
on top of it.

09:27.339 --> 09:29.407
She doesn't like me
coming out to her place,

09:29.456 --> 09:31.027
says I'm a bad influence.

09:31.076 --> 09:32.457
Hahahaha!

09:32.893 --> 09:35.044
This is the part where you can
disagree with her.

09:35.168 --> 09:37.121
Wish I could there, Hank.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.331
Right. Hank the disgrace,

09:39.388 --> 09:41.621
Hank the... deadbeat.

09:43.981 --> 09:46.386
So, are you shacking up with your boss?

09:46.777 --> 09:48.822
She's not my boss, she's my partner.

09:48.871 --> 09:50.574
She know that?

09:50.684 --> 09:52.175
Hanleys always think they're the boss.

09:52.224 --> 09:54.520
Alright, so, the affidavit.

09:54.569 --> 09:56.240
Yeah, right, about that,

09:56.289 --> 09:58.003
it's gonna have to wait.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.254
Can't wait.

09:59.303 --> 10:00.621
Sorry, Billy boy, but I handicapped

10:00.670 --> 10:02.108
a huge overlay on the first.

10:02.262 --> 10:03.707
Wanna come with me?

10:03.756 --> 10:05.121
You can write up the statement
on the way.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.490
But it's post-time, son. Come on!

10:12.738 --> 10:14.038
Come on.

11:44.473 --> 11:46.194
You make your own luck.

11:47.604 --> 11:48.822
Go on, give 'em a rub.

11:48.905 --> 11:50.295
I'm not rubbing your tickets.

11:50.413 --> 11:52.695
- Used to do it all the time.
- Yeah, when I was 8.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.351
I didn't bring you
to the races when you were 8.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.000
Did I?

11:56.186 --> 11:58.820
Well, you used to bring me
all kinds of crazy luck!

11:58.906 --> 12:01.359
I'm not sure there's much
I can do about Pookievision;

12:01.424 --> 12:02.976
you picked the longest shot
on the board.

12:03.025 --> 12:04.778
He doesn't know that.

12:05.128 --> 12:06.555
I'd always buy you a new toy

12:06.604 --> 12:08.743
whenever you picked me a
winner, remember?

12:08.976 --> 12:11.633
Come on, Lucky.
You rub for old time's sake.

12:17.286 --> 12:18.664
No, that's for you.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.286
Let's go find a quiet place;

12:23.335 --> 12:24.877
we can go over the
details of the affidavit.

12:24.926 --> 12:27.706
Nah, after. The race
is about to go off.

12:27.951 --> 12:30.018
Hey, we need a couple of beers.

12:38.899 --> 12:40.766
Excuse me.

12:40.864 --> 12:43.631
Elm Creek is a public and
private middle school, right?

12:43.918 --> 12:46.129
- Sorry, hi.
- Hi yourself.

12:46.303 --> 12:48.034
You know I can't tell you
where Kodie's kids are.

12:48.083 --> 12:51.346
- It's Kodie you can't tell that to.
- You're her lawyer.

12:54.267 --> 12:56.568
Kodie's been lying to me.

12:58.419 --> 13:01.093
Her kids did have
a relationship with Granny.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.651
- Where did you get this?
- True's room,

13:04.700 --> 13:06.387
secret box of treasures.

13:06.676 --> 13:08.036
Jo, you can't just rifle

13:08.085 --> 13:10.075
through someone's private stuff.

13:10.124 --> 13:11.330
She's 8.

13:11.379 --> 13:13.021
She's still a person.

13:13.070 --> 13:16.136
Not a real person in
the eyes of the law.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.102
You know what I mean.

13:19.355 --> 13:21.895
You really don't get kids, do you?

13:22.305 --> 13:24.825
Marlene has been
impersonating a social worker,

13:24.881 --> 13:26.841
trying to pay off neighbours.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.379
I need to know the truth.

13:30.442 --> 13:31.895
Diane,

13:32.050 --> 13:33.464
I'm not gonna break the law,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.253
I don't want to be disbarred.

13:36.095 --> 13:38.196
OK. Let's see what I can do.

13:42.051 --> 13:44.740
Man, I miss driving.

13:44.933 --> 13:47.800
Sweet tunes, open road,

13:47.878 --> 13:49.823
best feeling in the world.

13:50.011 --> 13:51.465
When do you get your licence back?

13:51.601 --> 13:53.373
Let's work on my kids first.

13:53.422 --> 13:55.856
Yeah, cool. Good to prioritize.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.075
So, what's the first thing you'll do?

14:01.124 --> 14:03.792
- What?
- When you get your kids back?

14:06.982 --> 14:09.613
Squeeze 'em 'til they can't breathe.

14:10.426 --> 14:11.942
And then go to DQ.

14:14.075 --> 14:15.696
Hey, take the next right.

14:15.747 --> 14:17.880
- What?
- Gotta make a quick stop.

14:18.094 --> 14:19.988
I promised Joanna I'd take you
straight to the lab.

14:20.037 --> 14:22.137
It'll take two seconds.

14:22.723 --> 14:24.191
She'll kill me.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.300
She doesn't have to know.

14:26.664 --> 14:28.900
Come on, quick pit stop.

14:29.959 --> 14:31.520
Look, you can either drive me

14:31.569 --> 14:33.945
or I can jump out
of this moving vehicle.

14:36.785 --> 14:39.661
548 days.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.316
That's how long I'm clean.

14:42.411 --> 14:44.912
I am passing this test.

14:55.191 --> 14:57.394
My teacher told me I can't
be late to school anymore.

14:57.820 --> 15:00.505
But if I don't get True
breakfast, nobody will.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.028
Turn it off.

15:03.961 --> 15:06.444
It was dumb of me to post that.

15:07.982 --> 15:09.919
It was a bad time for my mom,

15:09.968 --> 15:11.966
but she's been good for a long time.

15:12.015 --> 15:13.457
I know.

15:14.150 --> 15:17.252
You made that video
almost two years ago now.

15:17.863 --> 15:21.524
Was that after Marlene started
seeing you and your sister?

15:21.691 --> 15:23.524
Is this why they took us away?

15:23.573 --> 15:26.641
Madison, this is not your fault.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.853
We just need to know when Marlene

15:29.902 --> 15:32.395
started showing up at the house.

15:38.157 --> 15:39.893
Did she ask your mom if it was OK

15:39.942 --> 15:41.789
to take you guys out
for True's birthday?

15:42.638 --> 15:44.846
She never asked, she just...

15:45.263 --> 15:48.015
started showing up at school,
giving us stuff.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.751
- Did your mom know about that?
- No.

15:50.854 --> 15:52.788
Marlene made us keep it a secret.

15:54.712 --> 15:58.013
But when she bought us new outfits,

15:58.062 --> 16:00.029
my mom noticed.

16:01.277 --> 16:04.079
But Kodie didn't stop the visits.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.217
- Only after the cheque.
- What cheque?

16:10.297 --> 16:12.585
Did your grandmother send it?

16:13.026 --> 16:14.859
Madison, what was it for?

16:15.267 --> 16:16.777
I don't know, but...

16:17.306 --> 16:19.540
Mom and Granny fought about it a lot.

16:19.589 --> 16:21.103
so I hid it.

16:22.634 --> 16:24.667
You still have it?

16:25.821 --> 16:27.388
Where?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.157
Before I tell you, you need to promise

16:32.206 --> 16:34.312
to do something for me too.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.084
My overnight bag;
when they came for us,

16:37.133 --> 16:39.600
I put all my important stuff in there,

16:39.676 --> 16:41.384
but they took it.

16:42.032 --> 16:44.697
I need you to get it back for
me, please.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.581
Yeah.

16:55.511 --> 16:56.971
I can't tell you how many times

16:57.020 --> 16:58.920
I've heard the same story
past few years.

16:58.969 --> 17:00.522
Children being apprehended?

17:00.571 --> 17:02.123
Some of the kids, I totally get it -

17:02.176 --> 17:03.310
they need to be protected -

17:03.359 --> 17:05.259
but... then there's others.

17:05.308 --> 17:06.756
Like Kodie's.

17:06.805 --> 17:08.199
The laws are overly broad.

17:08.248 --> 17:10.435
And even as a principal,
there's nothing I can do.

17:10.484 --> 17:11.810
Makes me feel so helpless.

17:11.935 --> 17:13.303
Yeah.

17:13.352 --> 17:15.002
But I don't do helpless.

17:15.063 --> 17:17.594
And that's why God made you the lawyer.

17:17.773 --> 17:20.007
My father made me a lawyer.

17:20.214 --> 17:22.112
And you're the best one I know.

17:22.201 --> 17:23.310
If I'm so good,

17:23.359 --> 17:25.279
why haven't I been able to
get Kodie's kids back yet?

17:25.328 --> 17:27.326
Patience, my friend.

17:27.388 --> 17:29.224
Also something I don't do.

17:29.393 --> 17:31.980
Marlene took those kids
without permission;

17:32.029 --> 17:33.754
I need a paper trail.

17:33.968 --> 17:35.115
Cat, hey. I need you to go to

17:35.164 --> 17:36.561
Millwood Child and Family Services

17:36.610 --> 17:38.025
and file an unauthorized access

17:38.074 --> 17:39.373
against Marlene Loddington.

17:39.422 --> 17:41.810
I'm getting another call, sorry.

17:42.099 --> 17:45.806
- Joanna Chang.
- Joanna Chang, Alan Christie.

17:45.937 --> 17:47.788
- Alan?
- Listen, are you free

17:47.837 --> 17:49.639
for supper? I'm in the Peg.

17:49.734 --> 17:52.319
- Actually, I'm in Millwood.
- Millwood?

17:52.462 --> 17:54.478
You haven't had enough of that place?

17:54.912 --> 17:58.080
OK, no worries,
I'll make the trip to you

17:58.197 --> 18:00.348
- with a proposition.
- A proposition?

18:00.574 --> 18:02.283
I don't think tonight's gonna work.

18:02.721 --> 18:04.297
An incredible opportunity, Jo.

18:04.346 --> 18:07.142
But I leave tomorrow first
thing, it's gotta be today.

18:07.947 --> 18:09.493
OK, I'll think about it
and call you back.

18:10.136 --> 18:12.032
What was that about?

18:12.519 --> 18:14.035
Nothing.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.080
I'm kind of curious about

18:22.129 --> 18:24.579
your newfound interest in child safety.

18:25.845 --> 18:27.861
Because after you left
and Mom died, you seemed

18:27.910 --> 18:30.211
pretty fine with the idea
of us raising ourselves.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.063
I had to feed my family, I was working.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.002
The benders... did those work?

18:38.620 --> 18:41.435
And here they come around the outside!

18:42.032 --> 18:43.157
One counted as four.

18:43.230 --> 18:44.751
And down the stretch they come!

18:44.799 --> 18:45.853
It's Tiger Express.

18:45.902 --> 18:48.085
Tiger Express a length behind Sunwaltz.

18:48.134 --> 18:50.517
And here comes Pookievision
flying on the outside.

18:50.566 --> 18:51.899
He's not gonna get there.

18:52.058 --> 18:53.134
Time with this four!

18:53.183 --> 18:55.368
- Come on, get there!
- ...and Sunwaltz.

18:55.417 --> 18:58.852
Sunwaltz as Pookievision continues
to run down on the outside.

18:58.908 --> 19:02.014
- Come on!
- It's Sunwaltz by half a...

19:02.063 --> 19:04.798
Pookievision pushed with every stride!

19:04.876 --> 19:06.947
- Come on, come on! Go, go!
- Come on!

19:07.024 --> 19:08.883
- Come on! Come on!
- Pookievision!

19:16.684 --> 19:19.552
Aaah, Pookievision!

19:29.771 --> 19:32.239
Alright, stay here.
I'll just be a minute.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.451
Get down! Down! DOWN!

20:15.995 --> 20:17.506
Go on!

20:23.146 --> 20:25.370
Just needed a piece of home.

21:31.243 --> 21:32.846
Oh!

21:32.943 --> 21:34.103
I never thought he would have found

21:34.151 --> 21:35.274
enough room to make that move.

21:35.323 --> 21:36.931
It's you, Billy boy!

21:37.027 --> 21:38.842
If you're not here,
Pookievision doesn't win!

21:38.891 --> 21:40.271
I don't think that's how that works.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.777
Now you're gonna tell me
how luck works.

21:41.826 --> 21:43.786
I'm just saying I had nothing
to do with that horse win.

21:43.835 --> 21:45.461
Are you kidding me?!

21:45.555 --> 21:47.651
You had everything to do with it.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.167
Some people are just born lucky,
and you're one of 'em.

21:50.346 --> 21:52.063
I mean, look at the goddess

21:52.112 --> 21:54.240
who's agreed to share your
bed, that's pure luck.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.649
And a head for numbers.

21:55.698 --> 21:57.892
You've got a deadly combination, kid!

21:57.958 --> 21:59.618
You could calculate odds in your head,

21:59.667 --> 22:00.929
before you could read.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.644
I remember your first-grade teacher...

22:03.693 --> 22:05.777
Ms. Romansky.
God, I had the hots for her.

22:05.874 --> 22:07.348
You're a Crawford.

22:07.628 --> 22:10.333
She was so impressed
with my little math prodigy.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.920
I didn't tell her
it was thanks to the ponies.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.251
And that's cold cash.

22:15.495 --> 22:17.368
I got my eye on a
filly in the next race,

22:17.417 --> 22:18.774
- first time on Lazings.
- Oh no, no, no.

22:18.823 --> 22:20.375
Ever hear of "quit while you're ahead"?

22:20.424 --> 22:22.329
It's not my style, Billy boy.

22:23.329 --> 22:25.262
That's why I kept reaching out to you.

22:25.835 --> 22:27.800
You know, university and law school

22:27.849 --> 22:30.326
after you won that big case,
all those sick girls...

22:30.375 --> 22:31.789
You just wanted a taste of the money.

22:31.838 --> 22:33.765
No, I just wanted to talk to you

22:33.814 --> 22:34.936
and congratulate you.

22:35.026 --> 22:37.057
Well, I wasn't ready.

22:37.394 --> 22:39.795
Well, I'm happy you're here now.

22:43.024 --> 22:44.446
Alright, Dad, the affidavit.

22:44.495 --> 22:46.674
Right, right, the papers.

22:46.836 --> 22:49.007
But first, a couple more whisky shots.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.268
So I can get through
all the legal gobbledygook.

23:03.241 --> 23:05.587
- Hey!
- Hey!

23:06.022 --> 23:08.522
- Where are you?
- Uh, the track.

23:08.571 --> 23:10.086
Trains?

23:10.135 --> 23:11.547
Horses. It's a long story.

23:11.596 --> 23:13.052
My dad's about to sign the affidavit.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.101
That's great.

23:19.242 --> 23:20.529
Are you there?

23:22.041 --> 23:23.668
Just give me a second.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.844
I just found proof that Marlene tried

24:01.893 --> 24:04.352
to buy one of her granddaughters.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.427
Hey, did you get her to the drug test?

24:12.476 --> 24:14.055
Sorry. We just got here.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.190
We had to make a stop.

24:15.239 --> 24:17.846
Is that a you we or a Kodie we?

24:18.023 --> 24:20.114
Sorry, I can't really hear you.

24:20.476 --> 24:22.103
I'm appealing Marlene's guardianship.

24:22.152 --> 24:23.965
I got the last slot today.

24:24.353 --> 24:26.704
- What?
- Luna?

24:29.303 --> 24:32.913
I think Joanna just said
we got an appeal for today.

24:34.593 --> 24:36.528
Alright then.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.666
Somebody, find me a cup.

24:50.394 --> 24:52.005
You OK?

24:55.963 --> 24:57.831
Yeah.

25:36.488 --> 25:38.549
Stop! Stop!

25:42.617 --> 25:44.116
OK.

26:14.414 --> 26:15.883
And that's all she wrote

26:15.932 --> 26:17.586
as even-money favourite Candybean

26:17.635 --> 26:19.794
romps across the lines.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.428
you didn't have that one.

26:37.865 --> 26:39.922
Yeah, those tours gave him
a terrible ride.

26:39.993 --> 26:41.514
I suppose my luck ran out.

26:41.563 --> 26:43.445
Yeah. Your luck and my money.

26:43.595 --> 26:45.562
Don't tell me you gave it all back.

26:48.627 --> 26:50.625
Alright, I need you to
sign that affidavit, Hank.

26:50.745 --> 26:52.673
Lend me a couple of bullets first.

26:52.722 --> 26:54.522
The money I gave you from
the Pookievision win,

26:54.571 --> 26:55.727
it's technically still mine.

26:55.776 --> 26:56.826
Stop.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.470
The affidavit is more important.

26:58.519 --> 26:59.561
Wouldn't be here otherwise.

26:59.610 --> 27:01.561
And I'll sign it
if you give me some money!

27:01.610 --> 27:03.102
No. It's called bribing a witness,

27:03.151 --> 27:04.814
I could be disbarred.

27:05.495 --> 27:08.117
- God, she's awful pushy.

27:08.735 --> 27:10.657
Got you in a vice, I get it.

27:10.820 --> 27:12.501
I mean, there's fighting
above your weight class,

27:12.549 --> 27:14.215
and then there's just
different leagues.

27:14.613 --> 27:17.614
A filly like that,
she won't stick around long.

27:17.843 --> 27:19.176
You know that, right?

27:22.497 --> 27:23.609
Hey!

27:30.742 --> 27:32.743
- Come on! Hit me! Come on!
- Throw me under the bus!

27:32.868 --> 27:35.686
Come on, kid!
Hey, you think I'm a loser, huh?

27:35.812 --> 27:37.672
- Come on, come on!
- Come at me!

27:37.721 --> 27:40.071
Yes, come on! Come on!

27:40.258 --> 27:43.350
Get up! Hit me, come on!

27:44.853 --> 27:46.274
Come on, you drunk, hit me!

27:48.631 --> 27:50.565
Come on, man, get up!

28:05.216 --> 28:06.291
Billy?

28:06.340 --> 28:08.730
Hey! You never called.

28:09.445 --> 28:11.935
Sorry, it has been a crazy day,

28:11.984 --> 28:13.151
and I'm due in court soon.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.396
OK. Well then, I'll be quick.

28:15.471 --> 28:18.039
I left the law
and I'm managing a hedge fund.

28:18.193 --> 28:21.953
Emerging markets,
lots of travel, exotic foods.

28:22.002 --> 28:23.791
And we're looking for in-house counsel.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.827
Someone who gets
and inhabits the world,

28:25.876 --> 28:28.763
someone basically exactly like you.

28:28.966 --> 28:30.232
I'm flattered,

28:30.281 --> 28:32.006
but I can't be in-house counsel,

28:32.055 --> 28:33.180
I have my own firm.

28:33.229 --> 28:35.803
Yeah, I know. What's the name?

28:36.163 --> 28:37.325
Crawford Chang.

28:37.374 --> 28:39.707
Why would you
let Crawford put his name first?

28:40.309 --> 28:42.098
It sounded better.

28:42.148 --> 28:43.435
Look, I want you on retainer.

28:43.484 --> 28:46.114
Let me take you for dinner.
You can bring Billy.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.458
Just hear the pitch.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.636
I really need to prepare
for this appeal,

28:49.685 --> 28:51.560
but, I will call you back.

28:51.693 --> 28:53.254
For real this time.

29:03.538 --> 29:04.887
Taylor.

29:06.004 --> 29:07.749
Mr. Mitchell.

29:08.091 --> 29:09.890
I haven't seen you in a long time.

29:09.939 --> 29:12.045
- How have you been?
- Are you following me?

29:12.821 --> 29:14.068
What?!

29:14.172 --> 29:15.825
What are you talking about?

29:15.946 --> 29:18.518
Don't mess around, Taylor, I saw you.

29:18.888 --> 29:20.870
And I don't think
your father would approve,

29:20.935 --> 29:22.631
of you harassing me.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.619
And does your wife approve

29:24.668 --> 29:27.435
of you harassing sex workers, Jeff?

29:27.866 --> 29:29.023
Yeah,

29:29.177 --> 29:30.997
I saw what you did to that girl.

29:31.156 --> 29:32.599
And maybe your wife should know

29:32.648 --> 29:33.969
what kind of a monster
she's married to,

29:34.017 --> 29:35.050
don't you think?

29:35.099 --> 29:37.927
You're in way over your head.

29:38.015 --> 29:39.129
Let go.

29:39.203 --> 29:42.069
- If you go near my wife...
- I said, "Let go."

29:45.564 --> 29:49.007
Come near my family and you're dead.

29:57.872 --> 29:59.773
You're contending
that Marlene Loddington

29:59.822 --> 30:02.088
cultivated a relationship
with the Chartrand children

30:02.137 --> 30:03.479
without their mother's consent?

30:03.604 --> 30:05.018
That is exactly my contention.

30:05.067 --> 30:06.838
The court has settled
the matter of custody.

30:06.887 --> 30:08.846
Ms. Chang can't keep coming back.

30:09.002 --> 30:11.152
Marlene Loddington engaged
in a systematic plan

30:11.201 --> 30:13.049
to undermine
my client's custodial rights.

30:13.136 --> 30:15.236
She was generous. She's a grandmother.

30:15.285 --> 30:17.138
It didn't interfere
with any parental rights.

30:17.187 --> 30:19.874
It was an attempt
at constructive kidnapping.

30:20.164 --> 30:22.041
That's a heavy accusation, Ms. Chang.

30:22.097 --> 30:23.502
Yes, it is, Your Honour.

30:23.551 --> 30:24.895
But I'm not done.

30:25.014 --> 30:27.014
Marlene did all of this in the hopes

30:27.016 --> 30:28.635
of eventually acquiring them.

30:28.747 --> 30:30.080
"Acquiring"?

30:32.033 --> 30:34.289
This is a copy of an uncashed cheque,

30:34.338 --> 30:37.492
made out to Mushkode Chartrand
for $100,000.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.924
Along with an illegal contract,

30:40.973 --> 30:43.010
detailing Mrs. Loddington's offer

30:43.059 --> 30:47.072
to acquire full custody
of True Chartrand.

30:47.145 --> 30:50.238
- She only wanted to buy one of them?
- Only her blood relative.

30:53.135 --> 30:56.090
But at the hearing, she asked
for custody of both of them.

30:56.822 --> 30:59.448
I guess she thought the best
way to get her hands on True,

30:59.497 --> 31:01.643
was to pretend she
wanted Madison as well.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.987
Also, Mrs. Loddington approached
my client's neighbours,

31:05.036 --> 31:07.154
passing herself off as a social worker,

31:07.397 --> 31:08.752
offering money,

31:08.801 --> 31:11.276
in exchange for false
reports against my client.

31:11.361 --> 31:14.095
There are no witness affidavits
to support these accusations.

31:14.144 --> 31:15.663
My partner is in the process

31:15.712 --> 31:17.531
of procuring one right now.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.810
That affidavit will prove

31:19.922 --> 31:21.572
that Mushkode Chartrand's children

31:21.621 --> 31:23.009
would still be with her today

31:23.058 --> 31:24.158
if not for Mrs. Loddington's

31:24.207 --> 31:25.681
duplicitous efforts

31:25.730 --> 31:27.829
to pry her kids away from her.

31:29.173 --> 31:30.764
I agree that according to this evidence

31:30.813 --> 31:33.673
Marlene Loddington is unfit to
be a guardian to these minors.

31:33.722 --> 31:35.283
- Thank you, Your Honour.
- However,

31:35.332 --> 31:37.749
without further evidence,
this court must also take into account

31:37.798 --> 31:40.421
the continuing questions
about Ms. Chartrand's fitness.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.455
Above all, the court must put
the safety of the children first.

31:43.504 --> 31:44.908
- No.
- This court orders,

31:44.957 --> 31:46.689
that the minors Madison
and True Chartrand

31:46.738 --> 31:47.744
to be placed in protective care

31:47.793 --> 31:50.231
- in Millwood's foster system.
- Your Honour, please, you can't!

32:09.557 --> 32:11.312
This isn't necessary.

32:11.427 --> 32:13.694
This is my son, and we haven't
seen each other in a while.

32:13.743 --> 32:16.010
We got a bit excited is all.

32:16.215 --> 32:18.753
We can... we can sleep it off at home.

32:22.807 --> 32:24.808
I want my one phone call!

32:25.192 --> 32:27.192
That's only in the movies, Hank.

32:29.417 --> 32:31.184
The cops won't let us leave drunk

32:31.233 --> 32:33.266
or it's on them if something happens.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.933
For a minute there,
you sound like a real lawyer.

32:36.636 --> 32:38.448
I can't believe they took my phone.

32:38.497 --> 32:40.299
We're too bloody reliant
on those things anyway.

32:40.412 --> 32:42.578
Joanna's probably been
trying to reach me.

32:42.924 --> 32:44.811
The statement, right?

32:45.057 --> 32:46.938
We were just about to do that
and then...

32:46.987 --> 32:48.428
My fist got in the way.

32:48.582 --> 32:50.849
- We are Crawford.
- Stop saying that.

32:51.007 --> 32:52.407
Sorry.

32:55.663 --> 32:59.658
I am sorry that the fates
brought us back together, kid.

33:02.629 --> 33:04.347
Look, after your mom
died, you're right,

33:04.396 --> 33:06.408
I didn't know how to come
back from what I'd done.

33:06.457 --> 33:08.290
- Dad.
- Right.

33:08.435 --> 33:11.151
- Easy.
- You're not ready.

33:13.877 --> 33:15.897
Do you think you ever will be?

33:21.774 --> 33:23.574
I don't know.

33:26.231 --> 33:27.713
I didn't mean that girl any harm.

33:27.762 --> 33:29.608
That lady said she was on drugs.

33:29.657 --> 33:31.891
I wonder what people said about us.

33:49.138 --> 33:51.959
So, we lost again.

33:52.251 --> 33:53.535
What's next?

33:53.584 --> 33:55.116
We wait for the results
of your drug test,

33:55.165 --> 33:56.866
bring it to the judge in a few days.

33:56.915 --> 33:58.257
And in the meantime?

33:58.306 --> 34:00.229
Your kids will be rehomed,

34:00.278 --> 34:03.326
and you will maintain
supervised access,

34:03.451 --> 34:05.301
and we gear up for trial.

34:05.881 --> 34:09.100
When do I get to fight
for actual custody?

34:09.708 --> 34:11.840
The courts fast-track
child welfare cases,

34:11.889 --> 34:14.221
so within the year, for sure.

34:14.460 --> 34:17.130
Doesn't take a year to
mess up a kid for life.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.770
I just...

34:18.915 --> 34:20.913
I wish you'd been honest with me,

34:20.962 --> 34:23.822
about Marlene and the payoff
in the first place.

34:24.757 --> 34:27.559
I was in... a real bad spot.

34:27.608 --> 34:29.824
Kodie, if I had known
about that cheque,

34:29.873 --> 34:31.576
I would have destroyed her
on the stand.

34:31.625 --> 34:33.730
You don't get it, do you?

34:34.255 --> 34:36.614
I almost sold my kid.

34:37.748 --> 34:40.034
I thought they'd be better off.

34:40.799 --> 34:42.436
I need...

34:42.797 --> 34:45.944
all of the information in order
to launch our best defence.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.155
They're not giving me my kids back,

34:48.204 --> 34:49.420
and it's killing me.

34:49.469 --> 34:51.054
It's just gonna take
us a little more time.

34:51.103 --> 34:52.429
I don't have more time!

34:52.478 --> 34:54.858
Every second I'm away from them
is a freaking eternity!

34:54.907 --> 34:57.154
This is the speed
at which the legal system works.

34:57.203 --> 34:59.430
Bullshit! The system doesn't work!

34:59.479 --> 35:01.712
OK, the law is imperfect,

35:02.082 --> 35:03.959
but I know how to navigate it,

35:04.008 --> 35:06.098
and I need you to trust me to do that.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.751
You keep saying that,

35:07.800 --> 35:10.297
that I'm supposed to trust
you, but why?

35:10.414 --> 35:11.470
Sorry?

35:11.519 --> 35:13.282
Because this thing happened between us,

35:13.331 --> 35:15.274
like, 20 years ago, and that,

35:15.323 --> 35:17.560
what, that's still supposed
to mean something?

35:19.203 --> 35:20.477
It... does to me.

35:20.581 --> 35:22.461
We're not kids anymore, Joanna.

35:22.918 --> 35:24.813
You think you know me, but you don't.

35:24.944 --> 35:25.998
Kodie...

35:26.047 --> 35:27.540
If it happened all over again,

35:27.589 --> 35:29.032
I wouldn't do what I did.

35:29.259 --> 35:30.485
That's right...

35:30.534 --> 35:32.623
I'd leave you alone this time.

35:33.078 --> 35:35.382
And now I'd like you to do
the same for me.

36:30.894 --> 36:33.229
This is impressive.
It's only been two years?

36:33.278 --> 36:34.771
Yeah. It's pretty exciting.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.590
And in the next two,
we're predicting quadruple growth.

36:38.489 --> 36:39.990
I was thrilled when you called

36:40.039 --> 36:41.349
and told me to make the drive out.

36:41.398 --> 36:42.808
I needed a distraction.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.669
Nothing distracts me
better than numbers.

36:47.176 --> 36:48.972
Same old Jo.

36:51.598 --> 36:54.548
I was hoping Billy would be here.

36:54.609 --> 36:56.281
Yeah, me too.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.289
When are we expecting him?

36:58.407 --> 37:00.399
Your guess is as good as mine.

37:00.562 --> 37:01.711
Last I talked to him,

37:01.760 --> 37:04.329
he was at the horse
races with his father.

37:04.512 --> 37:05.968
Oh.

37:10.036 --> 37:11.325
Everything OK?

37:11.374 --> 37:12.828
Where to start?

37:12.955 --> 37:15.101
Toxic disasters,

37:15.239 --> 37:16.365
kids being taken,

37:16.414 --> 37:18.645
Luna, my father; it's...

37:18.920 --> 37:21.625
- all been...
- Hard?

37:22.622 --> 37:24.322
Human.

37:25.958 --> 37:29.623
- Which is hard, for me.
- Yeah.

37:32.838 --> 37:34.566
You've been through...

37:35.694 --> 37:38.124
a lot, and...

37:38.173 --> 37:40.333
I don't know, maybe it's time to...

37:41.718 --> 37:45.286
make a change... you know.

37:45.475 --> 37:47.475
And you come home.

37:49.971 --> 37:51.900
Sorry if I overstepped.

37:52.048 --> 37:54.586
No. Um...

37:55.014 --> 37:56.593
you didn't.

37:56.724 --> 37:58.824
I would be lying, if I...

37:58.873 --> 38:00.806
Said I didn't think about it.

38:01.983 --> 38:03.580
A road not taken.

38:03.845 --> 38:06.084
Or rather the road abandoned.

38:06.165 --> 38:07.731
Yeah.

38:07.780 --> 38:10.578
I started a boutique law firm
in Winnipeg.

38:10.671 --> 38:13.106
How is business?

38:14.877 --> 38:16.760
We're building momentum.

38:16.809 --> 38:18.791
Yeah, it's hard, you know,

38:18.840 --> 38:21.070
starting from scratch,

38:21.119 --> 38:22.984
especially in a town
where you gotta chase the money.

38:23.033 --> 38:24.686
I'm good at chasing money.

38:24.992 --> 38:26.691
Yeah, you are.

38:27.719 --> 38:29.494
I don't know though,
for me, I just prefer

38:29.543 --> 38:32.182
when it falls right in my lap.

38:32.231 --> 38:33.551
You know,

38:33.797 --> 38:36.103
like this hedge fund...

38:36.193 --> 38:38.870
We're committed to taking
cases that are meaningful to us,

38:38.935 --> 38:42.503
that have a positive social impact.

38:43.659 --> 38:47.314
You... almost said that
like you believe it.

38:47.423 --> 38:48.610
Look, I know

38:48.612 --> 38:49.900
that working for my fund

38:49.949 --> 38:52.710
might not make the world
a better place, but...

38:53.442 --> 38:55.634
it might put you back in touch,

38:55.683 --> 38:57.419
with that part of yourself,

38:58.136 --> 39:00.170
the part that you've been missing.

39:03.447 --> 39:04.914
Think about it.

40:00.910 --> 40:02.341
I need a shower first.

40:02.390 --> 40:04.590
No. Billy, where were you?

40:04.746 --> 40:07.784
- You don't want to know.
- Yes, I do.

40:08.444 --> 40:10.339
I left you with your estranged,

40:10.388 --> 40:12.885
abusive father, and then you ghost me?

40:13.021 --> 40:15.822
- I'm sorry.
- Where have you been?

40:16.318 --> 40:17.855
We got in a fight.

40:17.981 --> 40:21.124
Well, while you were
beating up an old man,

40:22.201 --> 40:24.167
we lost the appeal.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.346
Is that 'cause I didn't get
Hank's statement?

40:28.602 --> 40:30.737
I don't know if it would have
made much of a difference;

40:30.886 --> 40:32.638
I think the judge has it in for us.

40:33.550 --> 40:34.966
Hey.

40:38.056 --> 40:40.166
I'm just glad you're OK.

40:44.461 --> 40:46.729
Was someone over last night?

40:46.934 --> 40:48.100
Yeah.

40:49.764 --> 40:51.984
- Alan.
- Alan?

40:53.509 --> 40:55.748
Like your ex, Alan?

40:55.930 --> 40:58.199
Billy, I only called you
like a hundred times.

40:58.248 --> 41:01.416
- The cops had my phone.
- The cops?!

41:05.253 --> 41:07.339
He runs a hedge fund now,

41:07.388 --> 41:09.621
and he wants me to get
into bed with him.

41:09.670 --> 41:11.675
- Oh.
- He wants us

41:11.724 --> 41:12.783
to get into bed with him.

41:12.832 --> 41:15.032
Oh, that's... slightly better, I guess.

41:15.081 --> 41:16.535
Honestly,

41:16.584 --> 41:18.191
this could be an interesting

41:18.240 --> 41:19.604
financial opportunity for us.

41:19.654 --> 41:22.278
Yeah, to pay for the case
that we shouldn't be doing?

41:30.497 --> 41:33.167
You know, I punched that guy out too.

41:38.847 --> 41:40.593
Kodie's not answering her phone.

41:40.642 --> 41:42.642
How big was this fight you got in?

41:42.773 --> 41:44.027
If we find Madison's bag,

41:44.076 --> 41:46.243
it will be my peace
offering to both of them.

41:46.292 --> 41:48.325
Why is Madison's bag here?

41:48.487 --> 41:49.746
When kids are apprehended,

41:49.795 --> 41:51.395
they're not allowed to
bring any of their stuff.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.152
Foster parents are scared of bed bugs.

41:53.215 --> 41:54.940
So they just can't bring their things?

41:55.023 --> 41:56.785
Apparently not,
they start a whole new life;

41:56.834 --> 41:58.752
they can't even bring
their favourite teddy bear.

41:59.023 --> 42:01.027
Yeah, confiscating these kids' things,

42:01.076 --> 42:02.816
is tantamount to theft.

42:11.171 --> 42:14.239
Are each of these bags
from a kid that was taken?

42:16.027 --> 42:19.396
We're looking
for a pink and black gym bag.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.728
Aaah...

42:43.406 --> 42:44.953
You OK?

42:46.671 --> 42:48.318
No.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.501
Billy, we have to get these kids back.

42:53.213 --> 42:54.947
Yeah.

42:56.984 --> 42:58.985
Are you in this with me?

43:03.056 --> 43:05.829
Yeah... I am.

43:08.914 --> 43:10.981
Ah, it's on.

43:12.657 --> 43:15.134
- Beckbie, hi.
- Joanna, I'm down at Halden Academy.

43:15.183 --> 43:16.766
You guys need to get here now.

43:25.369 --> 43:27.483
Beckbie, what's going on?

43:27.532 --> 43:28.704
Madison and True,

43:28.753 --> 43:31.264
foster family came to pick
them up from afterschool care,

43:31.313 --> 43:32.571
- and they were gone.
- No.

43:32.620 --> 43:35.254
Treating it as a possible
parental child abduction.

43:36.305 --> 43:42.613
