SUE AIKENS: I have people,
clients coming in tomorrow,

00:20.867 --> 00:24.333
and I don't even know
if I can give 'em electricity.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.133
NARRATOR:
Kavik River Camp serves
as a remote fuelling station

00:27.200 --> 00:29.100
on the north coast of Alaska.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.067
For Sue Aikens, making sure
that camp is up
and running for her clients

00:33.133 --> 00:35.733
is vital to her business,
and her way of life.

00:37.367 --> 00:39.200
SUE: Get up on the perch,

00:39.267 --> 00:42.233
any time you can
gain elevation...

00:42.300 --> 00:45.100
You're gonna have
a much better picture
on things that are around you.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.333
And I'm scanning 20 miles out,

00:47.433 --> 00:48.933
Anything that looks weird.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.600
(AIKENS SPEAKING)

01:24.700 --> 01:28.433
It is possible
that we have a bear out here
about a mile-and-a-half.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.933
And the way
the wind is blowing, whatever,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.767
theoretically,
that can't smell anything
in camp right now.

01:35.867 --> 01:37.267
The smell
would be going this way.

01:37.333 --> 01:38.433
So that is a bonus.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.500
I need to get the generator on
for power,

01:40.600 --> 01:43.367
if I get attacked,
if I get hurt,

01:43.967 --> 01:46.000
I need to make sure
I have communications.

01:46.067 --> 01:50.233
Electricity, air-to-ground,
it's gonna save my bacon
when I need help.

01:51.467 --> 01:53.733
Can't even begin to fathom
getting hurt again.

01:54.033 --> 01:57.067
* I need to get
my generator running *

02:01.333 --> 02:02.733
This is my little gen.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.267
This right here is gonna
give me the power in camp,
to get stuff done.

02:07.367 --> 02:08.933
It hasn't run in four months.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.100
It may not want to.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.733
Get this
in the neutral position.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.033
That's tight, that's tight.

02:16.167 --> 02:17.533
All righty.

(GENERATOR CONTINUES RUNNING)

02:43.100 --> 02:44.167
Okay.

02:45.067 --> 02:49.733
Now I've got to go check camp,
make sure that, you know,
things are running.

02:51.467 --> 02:54.133
I have a huge clean-up job
to do.

02:54.233 --> 02:57.400
I don't know exactly
how I'm gonna get that done.

02:57.467 --> 02:59.000
Go me, get my ass to work.

03:01.267 --> 03:03.933
CHIP HAILSTONE:
Kiwalik here is home to me.
It's a good place to be.

03:09.567 --> 03:10.900
Coming with me?

03:13.700 --> 03:15.233
Get in the boat, dog.

03:15.867 --> 03:17.867
I'm gonna go downriver,
I'm gonna go get firewood,

03:17.933 --> 03:19.333
and I'm gonna
take my chainsaw.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.000
I'm gonna hunt and kill trees.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.433
And I'm gonna
come back here
with some tree flesh.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.100
Come on.

03:25.167 --> 03:26.500
Good girl.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.333
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
spend their summer in Kiwalik,

03:31.400 --> 03:33.967
gathering resources
for the months ahead.

03:34.267 --> 03:36.067
Harvesting firewood
is essential

03:36.133 --> 03:41.700
to providing camp
with heat, drinking water,
and food preservation.

03:41.767 --> 03:44.333
CHIP: Logs here come from
about 20, 25 miles upriver.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.333
And by the time
they get down here,
takes 'em a few years.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.633
This what I call
a mighty fine log.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.867
This is a good, dry piece
of knotty, twisted wood

03:52.933 --> 03:56.933
that has really
no carving value,
no splitting value.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
If you split it,
it wouldn't split
and make two halves,

03:59.067 --> 04:01.900
it would make a big twist
like a rifle barrel.

04:01.967 --> 04:02.967
So it's gonna be firewood.

04:04.433 --> 04:05.767
My chainsaw fired up.

04:05.867 --> 04:07.433
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

04:09.800 --> 04:12.500
We need firewood,
all the time.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.400
Keep ourselves warm,
dry ourselves out.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.167
'Cause we got caribou
to dry up,

04:17.267 --> 04:20.533
pretty soon
there's gonna be seals,
and skins and oil to put away,

04:20.600 --> 04:21.900
and whatever else
we gather on.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.533
I have to have firewood.
It's just part of the process.

04:36.967 --> 04:40.000
The only time the girls
ever take any notice of
my firewood-getting abilities

04:40.067 --> 04:41.533
is when there is no wood.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.000
Then they remember...
(HIGH PITCHED) "Dad!"

04:45.033 --> 04:46.767
Come on, dog, join me.

05:01.633 --> 05:03.433
That's some nice-looking logs
you have there.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.533
Can't have too much firewood.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.133
My next step
is putting up a meat rack.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.833
Around here
they call it Inisuk.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.700
We need a place where we can
hang meat up off the ground,
away from the dogs.

05:12.767 --> 05:15.233
-We're gonna have to
tie the dogs up soon.
-(GRUNTS)

05:15.300 --> 05:18.633
And keep the wind
and the breeze on 'em,
and the flies off.

05:19.433 --> 05:20.900
Let's just get it done.

05:23.733 --> 05:26.400
JESSIE HOLMES: I strive
to live a simple lifestyle,

05:26.467 --> 05:28.333
on the river
doing the things I love.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.033
(DOGS HOWLING)

05:37.667 --> 05:39.700
What you doing, Polar?
(CLICKS TONGUE)

05:39.767 --> 05:41.467
NARRATOR:
Along the Nenana River,

05:41.533 --> 05:44.867
Jessie Holmes lives a life
dedicated to his sled dogs.

05:44.933 --> 05:48.267
Feeding them and himself
is a full-time job.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.633
But before he can gather fish,
he'll need a place
to store them.

05:52.167 --> 05:55.567
So I'm getting my chainsaw,
nice and sharp and ready,
so I can go downriver.

05:55.633 --> 05:57.133
I'm gonna build a smokehouse.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.800
So, starting there,
I'm gonna have to go find
some nice post,

06:00.867 --> 06:03.767
and get the bark
peeled off of 'em,
and some poles.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.367
Start getting all my material.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.500
I'm so pressed for time,

06:07.567 --> 06:10.033
because this is
just a small part
of what I have to get done.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.300
Thing is, I need to do this
in a timely manner,

06:12.367 --> 06:14.267
so I can move on
to my next project,

06:14.333 --> 06:17.433
then my next project,
and then my next project.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.733
This is better
than any day job.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.167
Or city job.

06:21.233 --> 06:22.600
When I'm out there
and I'm doing this,

06:22.667 --> 06:24.933
it is like I'm working,
but I'm working for myself.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.533
I'm working towards my goals,
not somebody else's goals.

06:34.067 --> 06:38.967
So I'm gonna head downriver,
and look for a really good
spot to cut post and poles at.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.133
Not every place
has the right kind of trees,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.767
so I got a couple places
in mind to go look.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.400
Where, they typically have
really good poles.

06:46.467 --> 06:48.033
It's about
seven miles downriver,

06:48.100 --> 06:49.667
pretty close to where
I'm building fish camp.

06:49.733 --> 06:51.600
It's a nice,
practical location.

06:57.767 --> 07:01.933
My time is limited right now,
'cause I'm trying to get ready
for this fish run coming.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.567
The fish are already
in the river,
and I'm missing out.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.433
As soon as I get this done,

07:06.500 --> 07:10.033
then I can get on to repairing
my net and my fish wheel
so I can get some fish.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.200
Got all my tools I need.

07:15.267 --> 07:20.000
Got my life jacket,
I got my hammer,
and my chainsaw,

07:20.067 --> 07:24.500
and my tools
for de-barking logs,
and my tools for the boat, so.

07:24.567 --> 07:26.800
Go downriver,
check some spots out,

07:26.867 --> 07:30.233
find some good posts
for the smokehouse
and get started here.

07:32.767 --> 07:36.067
Well, every time I go out
on the Tanana River,
or the Nenana River,

07:36.133 --> 07:38.733
I'm very apprehensive
to safety,

07:38.800 --> 07:41.267
'cause anything could
happen out there.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.767
Got to watch out
for sweepers in the river.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.367
That's this thing
that's sticking out,

07:48.433 --> 07:50.667
but there could be big logs
sticking out of the bank

07:50.733 --> 07:52.433
that you can't see
under the water.

07:52.967 --> 07:56.967
This river's so dangerous,
like, so many people
with a ton of experience

07:57.033 --> 07:58.400
have ended up
dead in this river,

07:58.467 --> 08:00.567
so I try to always
think about that
when I'm out here.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.200
This boat is great
and everything,

08:03.267 --> 08:06.333
but it's getting older,
and it'd be easy to
puncture something through it,

08:06.400 --> 08:08.100
if you hit a log really hard.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.733
Lots of stuff in the water
right now.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.967
It's high water,
it's windy out.

08:14.033 --> 08:16.800
These are the kind of days
you gotta be careful
on the Tanana River.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.467
Old camp right here.

08:20.633 --> 08:21.900
Well, you know
what I think about

08:21.967 --> 08:23.900
when I see
a little old structure
like that,

08:23.967 --> 08:26.733
I think there was
some smart old guy
that used to camp down here

08:26.800 --> 08:28.200
'cause there was
everything you needed.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.367
That's a nice-looking spot
here, maybe.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.300
All right, Tobias.
Hold up, Tobias, come on.
(WHISTLES)

08:34.367 --> 08:36.333
Tobias, up. Good boy.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.500
The beavers have really been
at work here, you know,

08:42.567 --> 08:45.933
and you can tell that this is
some nice old seasoned wood.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.467
This is exactly
what I'm looking for,
for smoking my fish.

08:48.533 --> 08:50.100
Looks like some good wood
in here.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.500
Nice spot to spend the day,
de-barking and
getting these ready.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.433
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
What a place this is.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.000
This is my favourite place
in the whole world.

09:13.267 --> 09:15.333
Getting packed up
for a little overnight trip.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.267
Several years ago,
down in Fairbanks,

09:17.333 --> 09:19.467
I met a man who used to
trap up in this country.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.900
And at that time,
he was living
in a little cabin

09:21.967 --> 09:23.533
that's several miles
from here.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.667
When he left the last time,
he told me that he didn't know

09:25.733 --> 09:27.067
he wasn't gonna ever
come back.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.700
And he left
a lot of things there.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.367
I'm going down there today,
take a look around.

09:31.433 --> 09:33.133
See what I can find.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.833
If there's anything there
I can salvage,
I'll bring it back with me.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.933
It's been 30 years
since anybody was down there
that I know of,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.767
so, there's a good chance
that stuff got strewn around
on the ground

09:52.833 --> 09:55.033
that would have been
buried in snow,
in the wintertime.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.400
Now the snow's melted,
I can go down there,
take a look around.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
Who knows what I might find?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.133
Long way to go.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.067
The trick is gonna be
finding the cabin.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.967
It's a long ways from here
and when I get down there,

10:07.200 --> 10:08.500
I'm gonna have to look around,

10:08.567 --> 10:10.200
figure out exactly
where the place is.

10:10.267 --> 10:13.367
I don't have
a map of the area,
I don't have a compass.

10:13.433 --> 10:16.267
I just go by the sun
and the landmarks,

10:16.333 --> 10:18.733
I'm familiar with
the mountains, the rivers.

10:19.067 --> 10:20.400
And just looking at the sky.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.533
That's how I find my way
around out here.

10:26.633 --> 10:29.600
There are no trails out here
other than the ones
the animals make.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.933
Sometimes you can follow
a game trail
for a little while,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.533
and then it peters out.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.000
This here is where
a bear's been
digging up roots to eat.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.900
Looks like he's just been
through here this spring.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.400
They like to eat roots.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.900
Certain plants.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.733
They store their nutrients
in the roots in the fall,

10:46.800 --> 10:48.500
and they're still nutritious
in the springtime.

10:48.567 --> 10:49.767
So when the bears
come out of hibernation,

10:49.833 --> 10:51.300
that's one of the first things
they do

10:51.367 --> 10:52.967
is they start digging up roots
and eating 'em.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.467
That's why this time of year,
even when I'm not planning
on hunting any big game,

10:56.533 --> 10:58.700
I carry my rifle with me
just in case.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.467
You never know
when you might run
into a grizzly out here.

11:02.633 --> 11:04.767
The sun looks like it's about
as high as it's gonna get.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.033
It's midday now.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.167
One of the biggest obstacles
to overcome,

11:13.267 --> 11:15.400
getting my stuff out here,
is the transportation.

11:15.533 --> 11:17.800
If there's stuff
that's already out here
on the ground,

11:17.933 --> 11:19.833
that I can make use of,

11:19.900 --> 11:22.567
well, I won't have to
fly those things out myself.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.700
Gonna start looking for signs
that somebody's
been in the area.

11:25.767 --> 11:28.200
Where people cut firewood,
that shows up for a long time.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.367
So if I see any stumps,

11:30.433 --> 11:32.000
I'm likely close to the cabin.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.500
Up ahead here,
looks like there's a lake.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.833
The trapper,
whose cabin I'm looking for,

11:36.900 --> 11:38.333
he had a cache on a lake,

11:39.367 --> 11:42.433
maybe a half-mile
or a mile from his cabin.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.400
This could be the lake,
I don't know.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.267
Look at this.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.100
Stumps.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.433
Somebody cut this tree
with an axe.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.300
Looks like it could be
about 30 years old.

11:53.733 --> 11:54.933
More stumps.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.667
Here, look at this,
that's the cache right there.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.533
(SNIFFS) That's the cache
he told me about.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.567
Oh, yeah, this is the place.

12:02.633 --> 12:04.367
This is definitely a cache,

12:04.433 --> 12:06.367
roughly 30 years old or so.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.833
It used to stand up
on top of poles,

12:08.900 --> 12:10.500
there's just one left
standing here.

12:10.567 --> 12:14.533
These metal cans,
they're to stop animals
from climbing up the pole.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.800
There's an axe stuck
in the tree over here.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.400
And a whole bunch of traps
hanging up from this pole.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.200
It's gonna take
some restoration,

12:25.267 --> 12:26.667
but that's a little
Hudson Bay axe.

12:26.733 --> 12:29.100
It's really lightweight,
I don't have one like that.

12:29.633 --> 12:32.600
Probably weighs about a pound
and three-quarters, the head.

12:32.667 --> 12:35.633
Really useful
for just carrying
when you're travelling light.

12:36.367 --> 12:37.533
I'll take that.

12:39.833 --> 12:41.233
Bunch of traps here.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.433
But I'm not so much interested
in these leg-hold traps

12:43.500 --> 12:44.933
and they're a lot of weight
to carry back,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.900
but it's good to know
where they are.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.567
I might come back
in the wintertime

12:49.633 --> 12:51.300
when I could drag 'em
on a sled.

12:52.167 --> 12:54.300
It's really interesting,
the stuff you find like this

12:54.367 --> 12:56.200
has been sitting around
here for decades.

12:56.267 --> 12:59.833
This is a piece of aluminium
that was used
in printing a newspaper

12:59.900 --> 13:01.933
at the time that this place
was built here.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.667
July 24th, 1982.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.933
I was 13 years old.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.800
Time's taken its toll
on this cache.

13:08.867 --> 13:11.333
Most of this stuff here
is really beyond use now.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.333
I got this one axe out of it.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.733
This will be useful to me.

13:14.833 --> 13:18.167
Most importantly,
now that I know
where the cache is,

13:18.300 --> 13:20.400
I ought to be able
to find the cabin.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.400
Because the cabin's within
a mile of here.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.667
I bet you
the cabin's just up ahead.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.867
CHIP: When you're familiar
with a place,

13:28.933 --> 13:31.233
and you know
where the resources are,
it's an easier life.

13:39.267 --> 13:42.000
We want all of these poles
to go over there, girls.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.100
Pretty sure you know
how to build one of these.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.000
It's the same thing
I've been doing for years,
and years, and years.

13:48.900 --> 13:52.367
NARRATOR: After the Hailstones
recently harvested
a caribou in camp,

13:52.433 --> 13:55.200
building a rack is essential
to preserving the meat

13:55.267 --> 13:57.267
and the rest
of their summer food supply.

13:57.733 --> 14:00.067
CHIP: Well, I'm gonna
make a meat rack.
An Inisuk.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.633
And my wife wants
a meat rack built,
and she'll use it for fish.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.567
She'll use it for seal.
She'll use it for caribou.

14:04.633 --> 14:07.067
While Chip works on
the meat rack,

14:07.133 --> 14:09.467
I'm going to be
with some of the girls

14:09.800 --> 14:13.533
just butchering and skinning,
and butchering this caribou,

14:13.600 --> 14:17.533
and reducing this one,
and then taking the other one,
and doing the same thing.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.867
CHIP: I'm gonna make
a couple of tripods.

14:19.933 --> 14:22.800
And I'm gonna put a top piece,
and I'm gonna put side pieces.

14:22.867 --> 14:23.967
And then we'll go from there.

14:24.033 --> 14:25.400
We've had a lot of rains
already today,

14:25.467 --> 14:26.967
and what we don't need
is wet meat.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.333
When you get water
on the meat,

14:28.400 --> 14:30.133
it makes a real
slick taste to it,
a real...

14:30.200 --> 14:31.533
It's just not good.

14:32.533 --> 14:34.167
I'll stand it up.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.667
Now you got to get 'em
to go like this, dear.

14:37.733 --> 14:39.567
Mmm, maybe a little more.

14:40.500 --> 14:44.167
So far I got
a couple tripods up
with my daughter Mary, here.

14:44.267 --> 14:45.900
We got up a top piece.

14:45.967 --> 14:48.567
Nice smoothed-off piece
that we use for the tarp.

hustling along,

14:59.733 --> 15:01.500
and this should be done
fairly quickly.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.433
Want to go grab a tarp,
want to go grab
a little bit more rope

my daughters understand
what my lifestyle is

This Inisuk is made

I had from last year.

I don't cut any of 'em up,
I know exactly
how many I need,

we're a full-fledged camp.

We're here,
we're ready to make meat.

JESSIE: Everything I'm doing
during the summer

16:28.867 --> 16:32.200

how I'm gonna be able
to mush dogs all winter.

Well I'm looking for something
not too big,

16:36.900 --> 16:38.633

I'm a very social person,
but when I'm working,

17:12.667 --> 17:14.400
feel like I do
my best work alone.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.233
That way I can just
enjoy my time.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.567
Gotta keep in mind,
with these heavy logs

17:20.633 --> 17:23.300
that I don't drop it
hard on my boat.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.200
My boat isn't as new.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.167

This is the spot

build my fish camp.

17:44.133 --> 17:46.867
And it's kind of
an ideal location for me,

17:46.933 --> 17:50.700
because my house is only
about five miles from here.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.500
Work on taking the bark off
of these

17:53.600 --> 17:57.000
so they can sit out here
and bake and kinda dry
and not be so slippery.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.333
I got a log spud, that I use.

17:59.733 --> 18:01.400
Hopefully,
these aren't too dried on.

18:01.467 --> 18:04.233
What you do
is you get a strip started
going off of these,

18:05.467 --> 18:07.533
with the drill knife
or the spud.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.400
Thing about logs,
a lot of times,
each one's different.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.400
Some of 'em will peel good.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.000
I am a little bit late
doing some of this stuff,

18:15.067 --> 18:20.267
so it's not quite
the ideal time of the season.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.133

pretty good.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.033
Ha, off she comes.

18:31.967 --> 18:36.167
I like this spot
because it's nice and secluded
from too much sand and wind.

I really just like the view,
and I like to have this island
for my dogs to run around on.

It's gonna be something
that's gonna last
for years to come.

All right.
Now I have
all my material here.

18:49.533 --> 18:51.733
I'm gonna
clear out some brush,
to open this up,

18:51.800 --> 18:54.667
so I won't be tripping
and falling over it,

18:54.733 --> 18:56.500
and right here
is where I'm gonna
put my smokehouse,

19:23.500 --> 19:25.633
You gotta have all your tools

at doing this,

19:32.400 --> 19:34.133
you know, like,
I'd have a nicer chainsaw.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.700
I'd even have a sawmill.

19:35.767 --> 19:39.367
But, right now,
I got the simple tools
that are effective

19:39.433 --> 19:42.333

spend a lot of money on tools.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.667
It could have been
this very axe
that I found at the cache.

23:08.733 --> 23:12.633
This tree right here,
could have been used
building the cabin.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.167
There it is.

23:18.833 --> 23:20.133
There it is, I can see it
through the trees.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.733
Look at that.
It's still standing.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.333
A lot of times,
a 40-year-old cabin
might not still be standing.

23:26.433 --> 23:28.867
It might have rotted
and fallen down by now.

23:28.933 --> 23:30.433
There's the old woodpile.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.867
Somebody left
without realising
they weren't coming back.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.533
They cut all that wood
for nothing.

23:37.767 --> 23:39.000
Bow saw.

23:41.233 --> 23:44.433
Oh, beautiful.
Thirty-six-inch bow saw.

23:46.433 --> 23:49.267
That's something I could use.
Just as a spare.

23:49.333 --> 23:51.967
Takes the same length blades
as my bow saw.

23:52.033 --> 23:53.933
Blade's no good,
it's all rusted up.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.267
But I've got blades.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.067
That one's a classic.

23:57.133 --> 23:58.600
It's got some history
behind it.

23:58.667 --> 24:00.667
I wonder how many
cords of firewood
would cut with this saw.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.100
Hey, look there.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.167
Binoculars.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.567
Looks like a bear
bit into 'em.

24:10.167 --> 24:11.533
Wonder if they still work.

24:15.867 --> 24:17.333
Piece of junk.

24:20.933 --> 24:22.467
Bunch of bear hair here.

24:22.533 --> 24:24.933
It looks like a grizzly bear
was rubbing up
against this tree.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.667
And that's how
a lot of this stuff
gets strewn around.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.833
Bears come along
when there's an old place
like this,

24:29.900 --> 24:31.400
and they just
help themselves to it.

24:31.467 --> 24:33.233
Go inside, look around,
throw stuff around.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.533
They're very destructive.

24:35.333 --> 24:38.300
Can see where
a bear's been on this tree.

24:38.367 --> 24:40.933
Bear probably threw most
of this stuff out in the yard.

24:41.733 --> 24:43.433
Gonna look around some more.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.433
Couple of
cast-iron frying pans.

24:45.733 --> 24:47.567
This would need
a little restoration,
that's for sure.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.100
There's a lot of history
behind this place.

24:49.167 --> 24:51.433
This cabin
was originally built
about 40 years ago.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.800
It's been out here
a long time.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.800
Let's look inside.

24:55.867 --> 24:57.367
There's the old door.

25:04.733 --> 25:05.900
Hey!

25:10.333 --> 25:12.400
Roof's all fallen in
on this side.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.667
The beam
that supported the roof,

25:15.367 --> 25:17.167
it rotted and cracked
right here.

25:17.833 --> 25:19.933
It's like an
archaeological dig in here.

25:20.233 --> 25:21.500
Check this out.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.233
I've never had
a radio up here.

25:25.467 --> 25:28.167
FM, AM, weather, air, police.

25:28.567 --> 25:30.533
Chilli powder.
But it's 'empty.

25:30.733 --> 25:32.900
Look at this.
Can you believe it?

25:32.967 --> 25:34.667
Un-waxed, yeah not my type.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.500
A file.

25:38.733 --> 25:41.667
A little rusty,
but that'll still cut steel.

25:42.533 --> 25:44.233
I can use that
to sharpen that axe.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.867
Hey, what's this?

25:46.033 --> 25:47.567
Little hatchet.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.400
Let's see what's in here.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.100
It's heavy.

25:52.167 --> 25:53.667
It's definitely
got something in it.

25:57.567 --> 26:00.200
(GASPS) Look at this.
Ammunition.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.900
375 Winchester.

26:04.533 --> 26:06.300
30-06! That's what I shoot.

26:06.367 --> 26:08.600
$12.60 a box.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.433
I pay over $40 a box now
for ammo for my 30-06.

26:12.733 --> 26:15.667
Full box. Brand new.
Never used.

26:16.733 --> 26:18.200
That's gonna be perfect.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.633
Ammunition's getting hard
to come by these days.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.500
This is a find.

26:24.700 --> 26:27.533
This is definitely
worth taking,
this ammo here.

26:27.733 --> 26:28.967
Found all this ammo.

26:29.867 --> 26:31.600
Some of it's for the same gun
I shoot.

26:31.667 --> 26:32.700
This is great.

26:37.233 --> 26:39.067
Look at all this firewood
he cut

26:39.133 --> 26:40.500
and never got to burn.

26:40.567 --> 26:41.967
Sat here for three decades.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.067
A little bit of it
is gonna get used tonight.

26:48.533 --> 26:50.933
Got myself a new axe.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.867
Resurrected after
three decades of disuse.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.000
A file.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.233
Spare bow-saw handle.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.033
Couple hundred bucks
worth of ammunition.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.300
And had a really good time
coming down and exploring
this old cabin here.

27:05.433 --> 27:07.900
It's just fascinating to me
to look at an old place
like this

27:07.967 --> 27:09.733
and think about the things
that happened here.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.400
Think about how
somebody lived down here,

27:12.467 --> 27:14.100
spent a whole winter out here.

27:14.167 --> 27:17.000
They lived in the same area
where I live
in the Brooks Range,

27:17.067 --> 27:19.367
and they lived
a similar lifestyle.

27:20.067 --> 27:21.933
It was a long day
walking down here
looking around.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.500
I'm gonna eat
a little dried caribou meat
for dinner,

27:24.567 --> 27:25.900
lay down right here,
spend the night,

27:25.967 --> 27:27.700
and head back up to my camp
in the morning.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.100
CHIP: So there's a lot
of resources here.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.533
And I can make a good living
and I always have made
a good living here.

27:42.700 --> 27:46.033
We busted our butt yesterday
getting this meat dried up
and the rack put up.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.733
They've busted their butts
cleaning up camp,
putting everything away.

27:49.800 --> 27:53.833
We got firewood,
and gonna go take the kids out
for a little pleasure cruise.

27:56.833 --> 27:58.300
We're heading downriver.

27:58.367 --> 28:01.067
We see most of the birds
in the flats here
are settled down

28:01.133 --> 28:02.167
so they must be nesting.

28:02.233 --> 28:03.800
There's hardly
any of 'em flying.

28:03.867 --> 28:06.267
Erm, it's a good indication
that it's nesting time,

28:06.333 --> 28:10.767
so, the least we could do
is get a hold of some
really good eggs for now.

28:10.833 --> 28:12.100
And we could get
a few dozen of 'em,

28:12.167 --> 28:13.833
we could put 'em away
and they're very large.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.833
We're pretty happy to have
any eggs we get a hold of.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.067
AGNES: Okay.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.367
CHIP: Go ahead, ladies.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.300

28:23.367 --> 28:25.433

I'm gonna let you
walk this island.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.633
I'm gonna go to the far side
of the island with the boat
and watch the boat, okay?

28:28.700 --> 28:30.300
Jump this creek.

28:30.967 --> 28:34.100
Right now we're looking
for some, eggs.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.600
And if we probably
go closest to the point

28:36.700 --> 28:39.133
towards those dried grasses
we might find some.

28:39.700 --> 28:44.033
When we just go around
the whole area we look for
raised-up grasses,

28:44.100 --> 28:48.433
or little dry patches
where there's a few feathers
here and there.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.367
That'll lead you towards,
towards eggs.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.633
Oh, yeah.

28:52.733 --> 28:54.233
-One.
-IDI: Want to put them
in here?

28:54.300 --> 28:56.000
-Oh, yeah.
-Three.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.300
Four, five, six.

28:58.633 --> 29:01.733
It's real flat, so it's easy
for us to separate.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.067
We can actually see
there's no bears or wolves
or anything else here.

29:05.133 --> 29:08.800
It's all right for everybody
to just go on ahead
and run their separate ways

29:08.867 --> 29:11.900
without any firearm,
or real danger around.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.767
We're just gonna keep walking
around the area,

29:13.833 --> 29:17.467
keep looking up, looking out
and just have a good day.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.067

when the geese come,
so my name means "goose".

Oh, you got a nest,
look there's a nest
right here too.

there was one right there.

are doing really well.

(HAMMERING)

30:58.900 --> 31:00.767
I like working
on this side
of the smokehouse,

31:00.833 --> 31:02.767
I'm starting to get
a little relief from the sun.

31:02.833 --> 31:06.333
NARRATOR: For Jessie,
building a smokehouse
is key to storing the fish

31:06.400 --> 31:08.800
that will feed himself
and his sled dogs.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.267
But with fish
already in the river,

31:11.333 --> 31:12.933
there is little time to waste.

31:15.767 --> 31:16.867
Shit.

JESSIE: My short-term goals

31:22.600 --> 31:25.433
are basically wrapped around
the same thing right now.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.533
Acquire some more top dogs,

31:28.600 --> 31:30.967
keep my breeding
programme going.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.667
Keep my resources
and my fish coming in.

31:36.300 --> 31:38.567
And spend more time at home
with my dogs,

31:38.633 --> 31:41.833
so, living on the river
is the perfect lifestyle
for that.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.800

31:58.667 --> 32:00.633
I've got enough of these on

to where I can
get up higher now
and get my ladder on it.

32:04.067 --> 32:06.100
And then I'm gonna run
my crosspieces across,

This next piece

I don't have the wall
to use the ladder on
like I did before, so...

32:46.900 --> 32:48.767
I'm just gonna have
to muscle this thing up here.

a significant point for me,

it's not a problem at all.

tumbling down,

I'm gonna put a tarp up

It'll shed water nice
through this nice slope.

35:33.533 --> 35:36.067
This is how
I keep the dining hall.

35:36.133 --> 35:38.067
Normally, has tables.
It's a dining hall.

35:38.133 --> 35:39.833
You come in, you sit down,
I feed you food.

35:39.933 --> 35:41.633
But right now,
during the winter,

35:41.733 --> 35:44.067
I take all of that out,
I put four beds in here.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.333
If I pull out
all the bells and whistles,

35:46.400 --> 35:49.533
I can house 83
at maximum in Kavik.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.133
Can't imagine wanting to.
But I have done it.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.033
Thirty-three is what I have it
set up for right now.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.033
Phew... (SPEAKING)

35:58.167 --> 36:01.200
You know the accident,
cost me my health.

36:01.967 --> 36:03.633
Somewhat of my sanity.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.333
Could in the end
cost me Kavik.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.167
I've lost over 300,000
in potential revenue.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.833
That's how much money
did not come in,
because I wasn't here.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.800
I'm just getting through it.

36:14.867 --> 36:16.767
What I can't do,
I can't lift any of these.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.600
What I'm actually doing
is just doing it anyways.

36:19.667 --> 36:20.833
There's nobody here
to help me.

36:21.367 --> 36:23.400
And that's just the way
the cookie crumbles.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.500
Have I gotten down on myself
a few times?

36:26.567 --> 36:28.367
Yeah.
This is shaky ground for me.

36:28.967 --> 36:31.467
This is a very
physically demanding place.

36:31.533 --> 36:33.100
Winter is brutally hard here.

36:33.167 --> 36:34.467
If I can't make it
in the summer,

36:34.533 --> 36:36.500
I sure as shit
can't make it in the winter.

36:37.633 --> 36:40.567
I should be able
to come in here
and knock this shit out.

36:40.633 --> 36:44.500
But the body simply
is starting to tell me
that you know,

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
I can't do everything
on my own.

37:05.567 --> 37:08.467
I hear the plane is coming in,
and he's gonna need fuel.

37:09.367 --> 37:11.700
This is Susan to Kavik,
how's it going?

37:12.633 --> 37:14.933
DIRK: Good, we'll be there,
just a couple minutes.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.367
All righty,
I have not had a chance
to work on the runway,

37:18.433 --> 37:20.800
so er, take a low,
slow flyover.

37:20.867 --> 37:22.933
You've got...
It's a bumpy ride

37:23.000 --> 37:27.967
and taxiway alpha
is a little bit un-groomed.

37:28.633 --> 37:29.800
(DIRK SPEAKING)

37:30.267 --> 37:32.467
SUE: All righty,
see you soon,
fly safe.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.833
I was in the middle
of trying to change
the winter-style dining hall

37:45.900 --> 37:47.733
into the summer-functional
dining hall

37:47.800 --> 37:50.400
when my buddy Dirk landed
and needed fuel,

37:50.467 --> 37:55.000
so, that's my first legitimate
Sue's-on-camp fuel sale.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.533
And he's just gonna get
some hundred low-lead.

38:02.033 --> 38:03.700
It's back to business.
That's what it should be.

38:03.767 --> 38:05.333
Business, business, business.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.567
The business
of keeping people safe.

38:06.633 --> 38:08.300
The business
of giving 'em food.

38:08.367 --> 38:10.000
The business
of being in business.

38:10.067 --> 38:11.600
Hopefully, when you come back
the next time,

38:11.667 --> 38:15.500
I will have running water,
showers, baked goods,
sandwiches.

38:15.567 --> 38:16.667
I had a lot of cancellations.

38:16.733 --> 38:18.333
People heard that I got hurt,

38:18.400 --> 38:20.867
and when
I couldn't answer rapidly,

38:20.933 --> 38:22.267
you know how people are.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.733
If you hear of anybody
that needs a place to be...

38:24.800 --> 38:27.067
I keep it tiny numbers,
I don't overcrowd.

38:27.767 --> 38:29.667
Keeping it
six to ten people a week.

38:29.733 --> 38:31.033

to deal with this today?

A cheque is fine.

38:36.833 --> 38:40.833
I started out 300
in lost revenue, 300,000.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.233
That's a $500 sale,

38:43.300 --> 38:45.733
so now I'm 299,500
in the hole.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.267
I'm coming up.

38:47.333 --> 38:50.233

a little bit closer
to being solvent.

We can do the best
that we can do.

is we're cleaning 'em off,

want to go over the rack
