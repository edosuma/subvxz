on Daniel's... change.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.274
- Yes, now, here you go.

08:03.357 --> 08:06.194
Now, if you look at page one,
you'll see that the--

08:06.277 --> 08:07.653
- What's this
drawing of?

08:07.737 --> 08:12.533
- It's a werewolf giving a furry
octopus a piggy-back ride.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.745
- What? No, it's Daniel being
attacked by a spider.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.080
- It looks like a spider
on a chandelier.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.373
- Did you draw this?

08:19.457 --> 08:20.875
It's really bad.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.543
- Daniel's forehead
isn't that big.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.085

he's got seven arms.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.087

You guys know
nothing about art.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.757

08:27.840 --> 08:29.634
We have several
problems facing us.

08:29.717 --> 08:33.471
First off, Daniel and his...
problem.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.182

the limbo and problem solved.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.767
Bam. Next.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.227
- And second, we have a new
Kanay running amok in town.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.437
- That's not a problem.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.940
That's an exciting
new development.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.316
- Oh, yeah,
it would be,

08:45.399 --> 08:47.151
if this Kanay hadn't
contaminated Daniel

08:47.235 --> 08:48.819
with some weird
spider thing.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.571
- There you go again,

08:50.655 --> 08:53.533
using made-up words like
"amok" and "contaminated,"

08:53.616 --> 08:55.660
and why is finding
the Kanay second?

08:55.743 --> 08:57.119
I say we
find him first.

08:57.203 --> 08:57.995
- We have to help Daniel!

08:58.079 --> 09:00.790
- Wait, Emma.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.458
I'm sorry,
Maddie's right.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.252

09:04.335 --> 09:08.297

find him--or her--first.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.799
- What? Her?

09:09.882 --> 09:14.303
- Yeah, I mean, Kanays
can be boys or girls.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.264
Right, Diego?
- Uh...

09:16.347 --> 09:18.307
- And then that would mean
that Diego and her

09:18.391 --> 09:19.642
would make
a perfect match!

09:19.725 --> 09:22.311
The last two Kanays
together forever.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.730

09:24.814 --> 09:26.107
- What?
I'm not!

09:26.190 --> 09:26.774
Andi's being hypothetical.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.567

finding this Kanay?

09:30.569 --> 09:33.322
We've got to help Daniel.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.660

information on the spider seal?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.036
- Oh, yeah.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.330
Um, it belongs to a powerful
rebellious line of Kanays.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.499
- How do we get it off?

09:43.582 --> 09:45.543
- Have to find the Kanay
that it came from

09:45.626 --> 09:48.212
and have <i>him</i> remove it.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.338

09:50.840 --> 09:52.800

how about the abyss?

09:52.883 --> 09:53.634
