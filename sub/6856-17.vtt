<i>Battle droids on Naboo</i>

00:20.163 --> 00:23.102
<i>As the Separatist rebellion
rages through the galaxy </i>

00:23.227 --> 00:25.627
<i>Even peaceful planets
are threatened</i>

00:26.127 --> 00:30.140
<i>Following the discovery of Separatist
droids wandering the grassy wasteland </i>

00:30.265 --> 00:32.465
<i>Naboo is once again on high alert</i>

00:33.139 --> 00:35.894
<i>Fearing their home
is facing another invasion </i>

00:36.019 --> 00:38.467
<i>Senator Amidala
and Representative Binks</i>

00:38.592 --> 00:41.171
<i>Race to Naboo
to assess the situation</i>

00:41.668 --> 00:44.704
<i>Meanwhile,
near the Gungan swamplands </i>

00:44.829 --> 00:48.393
<i>An even graver threat
is about to be discovered</i>

01:03.448 --> 01:05.322
We came as soon as we could
My Lady

01:05.422 --> 01:07.234
Have you found any 
more droids?

01:07.324 --> 01:10.724
Only the three But you can be sure
they aren't tourists

01:10.905 --> 01:13.627
I need you to convince the Senate
or the Jedi Council

01:13.752 --> 01:16.993
Or whoever is in charge of this
terrible war that we are threatened

01:17.457 --> 01:19.014
They'll need more proof

01:19.139 --> 01:21.863
Finding a couple of battle droids
will not be enough

01:21.988 --> 01:25.238
<i>Captain Typho 
the battle droid is ready for analysis</i>

01:30.906 --> 01:33.322
Have you been able
to retrieve any information?

01:33.447 --> 01:36.302
Unfortunately, the Naboo security
who discovered them

01:36.427 --> 01:39.056
Prefer to shoot first
and retrieve data later

01:39.951 --> 01:42.184
If they were found
in the grasslands,

01:42.353 --> 01:43.951
Where'd they pick up all this mud?

01:44.076 --> 01:46.522
Add that to our very long
 list of questions

01:53.143 --> 01:54.810
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this

01:54.810 --> 01:56.681
With your permission
 Senator Padmé 

01:56.763 --> 02:00.445
I would like to shut down
before I get sensory overload

02:00.570 --> 02:02.580
- Permission denied
- Denied?

02:02.827 --> 02:06.177
3PO, you may be able to get
some information out of him

02:06.992 --> 02:08.429
Cannot see

02:08.951 --> 02:10.128
Where am I?

02:14.231 --> 02:17.575
You are in very good hands
on board a Separatist ship

02:17.905 --> 02:21.909
Count Dooku himself intends
to reward you for your bravery

02:22.203 --> 02:24.930
- Bravery?
- For your assignment on Naboo

02:25.281 --> 02:27.828
Do try to activate
what's left of your memory

02:27.953 --> 02:30.858
We all want to hear
your tale of medical heroics

02:32.600 --> 02:33.486
Virus

02:34.780 --> 02:36.074
Yes, the virus

02:36.412 --> 02:38.491
You do remember, Please continue

02:47.554 --> 02:49.921
A small amount leaked out

02:50.650 --> 02:51.800
Must contain

02:52.143 --> 02:53.339
Naboo cannot know

03:02.375 --> 03:04.828
Lab must remain secret

03:05.035 --> 03:07.889
A secret lab on Naboo?
Where? You must

03:08.268 --> 03:10.418
It is a secret

03:11.012 --> 03:13.025
This is no Separatist ship

03:13.705 --> 03:16.580
Unless you want to become
a box of spare parts,

03:16.705 --> 03:18.855
You'll tell us where that lab is

03:21.177 --> 03:23.530
- The lab is secret
- Look out

03:29.306 --> 03:31.710
We'll never get any information
out of him now

03:33.826 --> 03:34.926
Meesa sorry

03:35.591 --> 03:36.891
It was accident

03:40.827 --> 03:41.827
Is

03:42.434 --> 03:45.891
- This what you're after?
- Meesa love him

03:46.139 --> 03:48.227
He's a very,
very good tongue grabbing

03:48.461 --> 03:50.800
Yousa finden in one placen

03:51.279 --> 03:52.146
Where?

03:52.271 --> 03:54.471
In the mud under the perlote tree

03:55.462 --> 03:57.613
Like the mud on this droid

03:58.331 --> 03:59.781
The eastern swamps

04:00.081 --> 04:03.391
I think Jar Jar just found out
the location of that lab

04:03.584 --> 04:06.787
They're planning an attack on Naboo
It's the only explanation

04:07.203 --> 04:09.301
<i>Delicate the situation is</i>

04:09.829 --> 04:11.429
<i>Two Jedi we will send</i>

04:11.797 --> 04:15.644
May I recommend General Kenobi
and General Skywalker?

04:15.769 --> 04:18.327
Relations with the Gungans
are a little tense right now,

04:18.452 --> 04:20.676
But they trust General Kenobi
like one of their own

04:21.789 --> 04:23.563
<i>Send them we will</i>

04:24.364 --> 04:27.433
I want as much information
as possible before the Jedi arrive

04:27.602 --> 04:30.881
See if you and 3PO can download
any of the other battle droid's memory

04:31.006 --> 04:32.379
I'm going to find that lab

04:33.526 --> 04:34.982
Are you sure that's wise?

04:35.830 --> 04:37.180
Come on, Jar Jar

04:54.538 --> 04:55.461
Back 

04:56.841 --> 04:58.088
That water gone poodoo

05:00.060 --> 05:01.360
This is muy bad

05:31.827 --> 05:33.360
This is bombad

05:33.952 --> 05:36.652
- Whatsa happen to them?
- It's the plague

05:38.511 --> 05:40.172
We're definitely getting close

05:46.228 --> 05:48.618
- Whosa are you?
- What you doing?

05:48.743 --> 05:49.993
Why yousa here?

05:52.559 --> 05:54.159
Whassa yousa thinkin'?

05:55.080 --> 05:57.480
Don't move
I don't want to hurt you

05:57.893 --> 05:59.692
Jar Jar, put your helmet back on

06:04.941 --> 06:09.201
Yousa okeyday It's not in the air,
it's in the water

06:12.807 --> 06:14.017
Who are you?

06:14.142 --> 06:15.916
Meesa Peppi Bow

06:16.241 --> 06:18.336
We think the virus that made
your animals sick

06:18.461 --> 06:19.878
Came from the perlote trees

06:20.556 --> 06:24.176
Yousa follow thisa river
Yousa finda yousa perlote

06:25.363 --> 06:26.468
Meesa take you

06:26.832 --> 06:29.180
No, Peppi, you stay here

06:29.745 --> 06:31.896
You'll be going home soon 
I promise

06:32.021 --> 06:35.873
I'll send some soldiers to pick you up
and take you back to Theed

06:40.954 --> 06:42.396
Keep your eyes open

06:42.521 --> 06:44.971
Look for anything
out of the ordinary

06:51.406 --> 06:54.038
I suppose one can never have
too many lab rats

06:55.239 --> 06:58.125
Please, escort our guests inside

06:58.609 --> 06:59.709
Roger roger

07:08.360 --> 07:09.360
A hatch

07:10.394 --> 07:14.019
Captain Typho, I think we're standing
right on top of the lab

07:14.144 --> 07:17.371
I need a geo scan
of coordinates SP127

07:21.369 --> 07:23.469
No way we're going to open this

07:27.454 --> 07:29.313
- We'll just have to
- Freeze

07:29.438 --> 07:30.938
Hold it right there

07:36.427 --> 07:38.008
Yousa let us go

07:39.018 --> 07:41.368
Who are you?
Why are you holding us?

07:46.708 --> 07:49.339
Wonderful specimens

07:50.656 --> 07:53.145
What's a life-form like you

07:53.270 --> 07:55.474
doing in a swamp like this?

07:56.401 --> 07:58.393
I was about to ask you
the same thing

07:59.197 --> 08:02.147
Thanks to the support
of my compassionate friends

08:02.272 --> 08:04.482
In the Separatist Alliance 

08:04.710 --> 08:07.979
I am creating life

08:08.753 --> 08:10.381
Howsa yousa creating life?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.856
I'm so pleased you inquired

08:13.401 --> 08:15.359
A demonstration is in order

08:16.002 --> 08:17.639
Allow me to present

08:17.764 --> 08:20.604
the return of the infamous

08:20.729 --> 08:23.335
blue shadow virus

08:23.725 --> 08:25.325
The blue shadow virus?

08:26.017 --> 08:28.340
I thought that deadly disease
was extinct

08:28.508 --> 08:32.299
Yes, it was wiped
from the galaxy generations ago 

08:32.424 --> 08:36.101
But I have given it life once again

08:37.403 --> 08:40.284
Yousa not creating life
Yousa taking life

08:40.650 --> 08:42.437
Yousa poisoned the gungan water

08:46.900 --> 08:48.720
Unfortunately 

08:49.195 --> 08:53.990
The blue shadow virus in its
natural form,thrives only in water

08:54.430 --> 08:56.730
Until I improved upon that weakness

09:08.585 --> 09:10.757
Your eyes do not deceive you

09:10.986 --> 09:16.994
I have perfected an airborne strain
of the blue shadow virus

09:18.202 --> 09:20.271
This is the last of the bombs 
doctor

09:20.396 --> 09:23.846
I'm well aware this is the last
You think I'd lose count?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.997
The virus in its gaseous forms

09:27.122 --> 09:28.896
Combined with these bombs

09:29.021 --> 09:31.221
Will release the blue shadow virus

09:31.436 --> 09:33.288
Back into the galaxy,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.742
More potent than ever before

09:37.020 --> 09:38.270
Are you insane?

09:38.468 --> 09:39.831
It's a deadly disease

09:39.956 --> 09:41.868
No life-forms are immune to it

09:41.993 --> 09:43.582
That's why it was eradicated

09:44.148 --> 09:45.912
You mean murdered

09:46.835 --> 09:48.085
Take this away

09:49.281 --> 09:51.773
Meanwhile, as we speak 

09:51.898 --> 09:56.253
Thousands and thousands of so-called
Superior life-forms

09:56.457 --> 10:01.060
Are spreading their disease of war
Through out the galaxy

10:01.710 --> 10:05.103
Perhaps they are the ones
who should be eradicated

10:19.028 --> 10:21.370
General Kenobi, Anakin,
we're so glad

10:21.538 --> 10:23.038
Where's Senator Amidala?

10:23.206 --> 10:25.477
- She went to look for the lab
- And you let her go?

10:25.602 --> 10:29.602
Senator Padmé can be very hard to stop
once she has made up her mind

10:30.432 --> 10:33.776
- Good point I know what you mean
- This is Peppi Bow

10:33.901 --> 10:35.773
She was the last person to see them

10:35.898 --> 10:39.805
- Padmé sent her here to safety
- Theysa looking for the sick maker

10:40.479 --> 10:43.183
- "They"?
- Representative Binks was with her

10:44.846 --> 10:46.830
Go with the Gungan
See if you can find them

10:46.955 --> 10:48.555
You've got it, Master

10:53.484 --> 10:55.508
Why didn't you send someone
to look for them?

10:55.633 --> 10:58.949
Considering the latest developments,
we thought it was best to wait for you

10:59.298 --> 11:01.084
What latest developments?

11:02.195 --> 11:04.411
We did a robo-lobotomy
on the battle droids

11:04.536 --> 11:06.578
And came up
with this piece of memory

11:06.703 --> 11:07.749
Who is that?

11:08.073 --> 11:09.458
Dr Nuvo Vindi,

11:09.670 --> 11:11.705
The senior medic
for the Perma families

11:11.830 --> 11:13.380
He disappeared ten years ago

11:13.708 --> 11:17.651
<i>Good news,
my soulless automaton friends</i>

11:18.252 --> 11:21.271
<i>We now have enough
of the blue shadow virus</i>

11:21.396 --> 11:23.890
<i>To start filling the bombs</i>

11:24.292 --> 11:25.572
He said "bombs "

11:26.352 --> 11:31.573
<i>We will only need to send one bomb
To each key star system</i>

11:31.960 --> 11:35.421
<i>Work quickly
I want them ready to deliver</i>

11:36.022 --> 11:39.484
If those bombs get delivered,
we'll be facing a galaxy-wide plague

11:39.609 --> 11:41.658
The war will be
the least of our worries

11:41.972 --> 11:43.327
There is some good news

11:44.210 --> 11:46.152
Senator Amidala found the lab

11:46.277 --> 11:48.753
She sent us the coordinates
before she disappeared

11:48.878 --> 11:51.149
We've managed to get
a geo scan of the area

11:51.274 --> 11:52.444
It's enormous

11:52.479 --> 11:56.894
It looks like there're 3 entry points
here, here, and here

11:57.425 --> 11:59.176
This appears to be the main lab

11:59.633 --> 12:00.706
And the bombs?

12:01.053 --> 12:05.086
There seems to be an above average 
amount of radiation in this area

12:05.215 --> 12:07.309
It's likely
where they're being assembled

12:07.478 --> 12:10.356
If Padmé has alerted them
to our presence in any way

12:10.481 --> 12:14.024
If Padmé's in there, and then we go
in guns a-blazin', she may get killed

12:14.403 --> 12:15.896
It is a risk we have to take

12:16.021 --> 12:18.820
Doctor Vindi and those bombs
must not leave the lab

12:19.257 --> 12:22.318
And if they or we detonate
one during the attack?

12:22.775 --> 12:26.544
Better to have one planet infected
than the entire galaxy

12:28.601 --> 12:30.798
These the ship belonging to them

12:30.989 --> 12:32.459
So where are they?

12:38.653 --> 12:40.253
Their tracks end here

12:44.375 --> 12:45.875
Peppi, it's a scope

12:46.428 --> 12:48.473
Don't let them see you

12:59.806 --> 13:01.806
- Where are they?
- Patience

13:01.931 --> 13:04.825
They'll be here in a moment
You seem a bit on edge

13:05.020 --> 13:07.781
There's a good chance we're about
to destroy all life on this planet 

13:07.906 --> 13:10.836
Including ours and the Senator's
so yes, I'm a bit on edge

13:10.961 --> 13:13.125
- Why aren't you?
- I'm better at hiding it

13:13.951 --> 13:16.169
<i>Master, are you there?
- Did you find her?</i>

13:16.569 --> 13:19.397
Negative I'm pretty sure
she's inside the lab

13:19.522 --> 13:21.960
<i>The whole area is wired
with pressure sensors</i>

13:22.085 --> 13:24.526
<i>There's no way to get in
without being detected</i>

13:24.651 --> 13:27.556
<i>- But I'm more than happy to
- Do not attempt to get inside</i>

13:28.497 --> 13:31.653
<i>I need you to detonate a bunker bomb
at the south end of the facility</i>

13:31.778 --> 13:34.525
<i>It should cause a nice distraction
and seal off the bomb area</i>

13:34.650 --> 13:36.398
<i>while we come in
through the hatches</i>

13:36.566 --> 13:38.066
You can count on me

13:38.276 --> 13:40.274
<i>Rex and his men
will be right behind you Snips</i>

13:40.399 --> 13:41.695
<i>They'll have your back</i>

13:42.213 --> 13:44.063
Come on We'd better hurry

13:47.269 --> 13:49.084
Padmé may be lost, Anakin

13:49.209 --> 13:51.959
Don't risk the mission
trying to rescue her

13:52.085 --> 13:54.374
I'll take care of the bombs
You focus on the doctor

13:54.903 --> 13:56.803
I know what's at stake here

14:34.457 --> 14:35.415
Now

14:40.677 --> 14:42.146
We have a breach

14:42.440 --> 14:44.885
All droids to hatch number one

14:46.282 --> 14:48.542
Friends of yours, I assume

14:49.180 --> 14:51.765
They arrived quicker
than I would've thought

14:59.281 --> 15:00.981
- Meesa come too?
- No

15:01.298 --> 15:03.798
Stay here and make sure
no one escapes

15:05.132 --> 15:06.132
Okidee

15:39.117 --> 15:40.383
It's quiet in here

15:40.508 --> 15:42.649
Looks like Ahsoka's distraction
is working

15:44.713 --> 15:46.063
Forward Come on

15:54.008 --> 15:55.008
Fall back

16:15.288 --> 16:18.384
Take another step
and your friends die

16:20.036 --> 16:21.438
Drop your weapons

16:22.481 --> 16:23.481
Wait

16:25.284 --> 16:26.484
Do as he says

16:36.954 --> 16:38.354
I can't hold them

16:44.331 --> 16:45.581
Need some help?

16:45.995 --> 16:47.839
So good to see you, Master Kenobi

16:48.654 --> 16:52.555
I realize I won't be able
to hold you for long, Jedi

16:53.396 --> 16:56.096
That is why
I'm going to give you a choice

16:57.338 --> 17:00.560
Fine with me, as long
as one of the options is killing you

17:02.151 --> 17:04.148
How about capture me

17:04.273 --> 17:06.598
Or save your friends?

17:24.561 --> 17:25.585
Are you okay?

17:25.885 --> 17:28.862
Ani, how about
the next time you rescue me

17:29.304 --> 17:31.335
Before you kill
all the battle droids?

17:31.460 --> 17:34.060
A little "thank you"
would go a long way

17:34.537 --> 17:36.137
Things are going well

17:36.262 --> 17:40.016
The lab is secure, and hopefully
Anakin has reached Padmé by now

17:41.477 --> 17:42.852
I'll get the bombs

17:43.020 --> 17:44.896
I'll keep the droids occupied

17:47.323 --> 17:49.526
Grab your blasters
We need to find that doctor

17:51.842 --> 17:53.765
Well, looks like the bomb room

17:53.890 --> 17:56.390
Yes, and luckily,
they appear inactive

18:02.946 --> 18:05.696
I spoke too soon
Get these deactivated now

18:06.641 --> 18:08.837
Anakin, I'm guessing
you didn't capture the doctor

18:09.372 --> 18:12.054
I'm working on it
Do you have the bombs?

18:12.290 --> 18:15.748
I'm working on it Dr Vindi
has remotely activated the bombs

18:15.873 --> 18:17.812
- They're counting down
- That's great

18:17.937 --> 18:20.697
And on top of that,
one of them seems to be missing

18:20.822 --> 18:24.161
- It's down here somewhere
- Ahsoka, we've got another situation

18:24.286 --> 18:26.372
Send all the clones
to search the facility

18:26.497 --> 18:28.315
- We've got a mis
- Master?

18:28.440 --> 18:31.317
We've got a missing bomb and a trigger
happy mad doctor on the loose

18:31.789 --> 18:35.194
Missing bomb? I saw Dr Vindi
give a little droid a bomb

18:35.319 --> 18:37.619
You guys split up
Find that droid

18:39.229 --> 18:41.327
You heard him Let's move

18:51.589 --> 18:52.589
Jedi

18:58.322 --> 18:59.721
Leaving so soon, doctor?

19:00.180 --> 19:02.218
You are running out of time

19:03.927 --> 19:04.927
Catch

19:18.188 --> 19:21.701
Obi-Wan, Dr Vindi's escaping
He's at the landing platform

19:22.570 --> 19:24.320
All right I'm on my way

19:33.205 --> 19:35.205
Something smells good in here

19:43.133 --> 19:44.783
Hey, there, little guy

19:45.324 --> 19:47.852
How about you hand that over to me?

19:51.878 --> 19:53.066
He's getting away

20:01.534 --> 20:03.535
Ahsoka, I found the last bomb

20:05.408 --> 20:07.455
Stay there I'll get the bomb squad

20:08.590 --> 20:09.791
Almost got it

20:18.283 --> 20:21.761
Don't shoot If he drops
one of those vials, we're finished

20:36.071 --> 20:37.026
No, no-sa

20:43.393 --> 20:45.368
You're under arrest, Dr Vindi

21:17.369 --> 21:20.862
The bomb's going off,
and we're all going to die

21:24.025 --> 21:25.256
Yeah, die

21:29.525 --> 21:30.538
What happened?

21:31.357 --> 21:33.958
Deactivated
Plenty of time to spare

21:35.472 --> 21:36.572
Plenty of...

21:37.890 --> 21:40.640
- Ahsoka, are you there?
- I'm here, Master

21:40.987 --> 21:43.384
The bomb has been deactivated
Did you find Vindi?

21:43.785 --> 21:45.970
Deactivated as well
Have you seen Padmé?

21:46.612 --> 21:48.262
She's right next to me

21:48.387 --> 21:50.642
I'm okay too
Thanks for asking
