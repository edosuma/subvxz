00:06.214 --> 00:07.214
Tom.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.552
Tom, you here?

00:15.432 --> 00:16.474
Tom!

00:55.597 --> 00:57.766
<i>Sources say
that the FBI was made aware</i>

00:57.849 --> 01:01.519
<i>of the evidence linking the vice president
and a number of cabinet secretaries</i>

01:01.603 --> 01:04.355
<i>with several senior
Russian government officials.</i>

01:04.438 --> 01:06.107
<i>Meanwhile, President Underwood,</i>

01:06.191 --> 01:07.984
<i>who has still not commented on the matter,</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:10.820
<i>in what could be construed as an attempt
to distance herself</i>

01:10.904 --> 01:13.114
<i>and her administration
from the apparent collusion,</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:16.493
<i>has fired all the accused
cabinet secretaries,</i>

01:16.576 --> 01:21.247
<i>making way for the first-ever
all-female cabinet in US history.</i>

03:10.398 --> 03:13.234
Not one, not two,

03:13.318 --> 03:15.862
but threeabortions.

03:16.154 --> 03:20.074
The third oneat 16 weeks.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.701
Think about it.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.912
That's not a few cells

03:24.245 --> 03:26.289
or a collection of cells.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.125
It's more like four and a half inches long

03:29.209 --> 03:31.211
and three and a half ounces. At 16 weeks,

03:33.630 --> 03:36.841
the president's baby
would have been the size...

03:37.842 --> 03:39.093
of this.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.597
My fellow Americans,
there are certain parties out there

03:42.680 --> 03:46.434
that hope to use my private life
for political gain.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.729
I'm going to say this exactly once.

03:49.812 --> 03:53.274
For many years, my late husband and I
tried to start a family.

03:53.816 --> 03:57.028
I downplayed that fact
in the past because...

03:57.737 --> 03:59.697
Well, it's a painful subject.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.284
When I finally became pregnant,

04:04.035 --> 04:05.995
the baby wasn't viable,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.373
and the pregnancy had to be terminated.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.791
End of story.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.003
The baby was viable.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.380
Francis and I, as parents,

04:16.464 --> 04:17.548
were not.

04:19.466 --> 04:20.969
So, let me be clear.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.137
This is the last

04:23.721 --> 04:26.182
I will ever say on this subject.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.393
Okay.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.866
I am so proud of every person
around this table.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.245
Each of them has served this country
with honor

04:47.328 --> 04:48.371
and distinction.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.623
Some as deputy secretaries.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.502
They are all accomplished Americans

04:54.585 --> 04:57.338
and members
of their respective departments.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.717
But I'll let them speak for themselves.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.555
Hello, my name is Jennifer Baumgarten,

05:05.638 --> 05:08.308
and I am the acting Attorney General
of the United States.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.437
Jenny's going to come in very handy.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.773
And as far
as the Justice Department is concerned,

05:16.024 --> 05:20.028
I share the president's commitment
to cleaning house.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.945
But isn't it customary
for the vice president

05:22.989 --> 05:24.490
to attend all cabinet meetings?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.034
Not necessarily, no.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.204
Listen, ever since I joined
the Underwood administration,

05:30.288 --> 05:32.665
the president and I have worked together
on a daily basis.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.375
Hand in glove. That's the way we work.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.419
Is it true that you were asked to resign?

05:36.502 --> 05:37.879
What? No.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.171
No.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.467
And the Russians and me,
it's preposterous.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.595
Look, the president and I agree

05:46.012 --> 05:48.306
the best way to find out
who's behind these accusations

05:48.389 --> 05:50.391
is to appoint a special prosecutor.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.769
And let him or her do her job.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.813
- Thanks very much.
- One more question, one question!

05:55.897 --> 05:57.315
Mr. Vice President, one question.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.483
One more question!

05:58.566 --> 06:00.568
Mr. Vice President!

06:00.651 --> 06:03.071
Mr. Vice President, one question,
one more question!

06:05.990 --> 06:09.160
Okay. Great. Thank you. Great.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.162
Okay, good. Thanks, thanks. Bye.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.580
Did she find him?

06:14.165 --> 06:15.083
Tom.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.001
- Did she find him?
- No.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.711
Front door was open.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.880
Dog's not there. No one was there.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.549
Okay, Tom, I am so sorry.
I felt like I had no other option.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.926
I mean, I swear,

06:25.009 --> 06:27.345
- I saw someone inside your...
- No, I know. I know.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.765
We can go circle back
and take another look if you want, but...

06:30.848 --> 06:32.683
That doesn't sound like a good idea.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.358
That's your fax.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.653
Great. How much is that?

06:43.736 --> 06:46.989
$1.90 for the first page,
$1.25 for each additional.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.284
And it looks like you've got
quite a few additionals coming in.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.202
But can I just...

06:51.285 --> 06:53.165
Let me just figure out
how much it's gonna cost.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.497
Oh. That's more than enough.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.957
Yeah, thank you.

07:06.884 --> 07:07.884
Here you go.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.762
- Thank you.
- You bet.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.145
"102.7."

07:59.395 --> 08:01.189
Why did you send the nurse away?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.275
Because she needed to eat.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.319
And I feel fine.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.114
- I find this anything but fine.
- No, no, look...

08:11.157 --> 08:12.700
This fever's good.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.077
I don't think it's supposed
to last this long.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.498
Do you want me to change the sheets?

08:22.460 --> 08:23.503
What's the point?

08:26.422 --> 08:28.674
You know, I support you no matter what.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.093
Whatever you want to try,

08:31.552 --> 08:33.179
but this is...

08:33.261 --> 08:35.139
Research is very good.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.642
Proven effective in Europe.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.570
Do you remember

08:50.530 --> 08:54.450
how dad used to make me
wear long sleeves at dinner?

08:56.661 --> 08:57.912
Do you miss them?

08:59.622 --> 09:02.083
Her, not him.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.794
He was always so sure about what was right.
Mom's doubt actually allowed her

09:11.842 --> 09:14.303
to deepen as time went by.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.346
Depth is overrated.
Do you want to cancel tomorrow?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.775
We can't cancel.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.322
What's wrong, Annie?

09:35.866 --> 09:36.951
Annie?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.915
I keep calling Duncan.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.629
And I've heard nothing,
and he still hasn't gone home.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.052
You knew he was gonna find out someday.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.598
Maybe it's for the best.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.643
If you're hungry or thirsty...

10:02.727 --> 10:05.313
Angry. Tired. Frustrated.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.276
I should've been debriefed by now.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.112
Again, if you need water
or a cup of coffee...

10:13.195 --> 10:14.530
This is ridiculous.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.657
Excuse me.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.551
No visible scars.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.472
I assume you've been looked at
by a physician.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.223
It's protocol.

10:41.849 --> 10:45.144
So is talking with a senior member
of the Agency.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.439
That won't be happening today.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.193
You're essentially burnt

10:52.526 --> 10:55.196
when it comes to your work
with any of the agencies.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.323
That's the term, isn't it, burnt?

10:57.406 --> 10:58.449
Not necessarily.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.867
Virtually always.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.080
Nobody knows what you said or didn't say
while in captivity.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.706
I didn't say, Claire.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.291
Madam President.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.379
Oh, and have you heard about Mark?

11:12.713 --> 11:15.508
He's made quite a spectacle of himself.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.344
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my voice out of it.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.846
I guess he thought
he could come out from under it.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.600
Yes. Well, the people that know us best,

11:24.684 --> 11:26.560
know best how to hurt us.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.554
President Underwood... Actually,
I've gone back to "Hale."

11:36.320 --> 11:38.072
You're wrong if you think I have...

11:38.155 --> 11:40.991
You are foolish
if you don't tell me what it is.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.709
Guess which kind of people
I'm done suffering, Jane.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.563
You were wise to come.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.566
I told you and I'll tell them.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.109
I don't want the job.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.782
Doug, just promise you'll hear them out
before you do anything.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.411
And just so you're aware,
Bill's not shaking hands at the moment.

12:27.830 --> 12:32.209
Doug. May I introduce you?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.920
Annette and Bill Shepherd.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.255
Hello.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.716
You remember Fred Amburg.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.051
Doug, for the record,

12:41.135 --> 12:43.679
I really enjoyed our conversations
in the facility.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.139
Oh, come on, man.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.558
All roads lead to Rome, you know?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.810
And Annette and Bill are Rome.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.272
Come. Sit down, please, Mr. Stamper.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.333
- These guys were just leaving.
- Well, Mr. Shepherd,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.237
- Annette.
- Brett.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.489
Talk soon, Bill.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.449
- Fred.
- Annette.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.341
Frank spoke very highly of you, Doug.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.470
You cold?
I can have 'em switch off the AC.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.931
Humidity in this town, my God,

13:27.014 --> 13:30.601
makes you feel like you're living
inside the mouth of a dog, doesn't it?

13:31.727 --> 13:36.106
Frederic Gustav Amburg

13:36.190 --> 13:37.983
is my very best friend

13:38.359 --> 13:39.860
over 52 years.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.073
We've traded marbles,

13:44.698 --> 13:45.950
stocks...

13:46.742 --> 13:49.161
a fiancée once upon a time.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.665
Please.
You're making me nervous standing there.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.922
Oh, Jesus Christ. Get over it.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.384
You should consider yourself lucky
you had Fred to talk to in there.

14:03.843 --> 14:08.681
You're like the guy who
finds $999,000 and says "Yeah,

14:08.764 --> 14:10.140
but it isn't a million."

14:10.516 --> 14:12.142
Brett Cole will be the speaker.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.395
Next in line, if you don't count Mark.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.939
We've gotta get this woman outta there!

14:17.606 --> 14:19.817
Mr. Stamper,
my brother gets a little impatient

14:19.900 --> 14:21.402
when it comes to the president.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.864
We know we share a common enemy in her.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.961
Whatever he left you must be damning.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.547
We know that much.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.048
Frank knew

14:43.132 --> 14:47.553
you were the only other man who truly knew
what his wife was capable of.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.889
The only one he could trust

14:49.972 --> 14:52.641
to do the right thing when the time came.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.685
Unless, Frank was wrong about you.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.446
A letter opener.
What does that mean?

15:05.029 --> 15:07.031
How did you get your hands on the will?

15:07.114 --> 15:08.490
It's called reach.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.784
You see, the thing is,

15:10.868 --> 15:13.662
whatever brings her down,
could bring Francis down, as well.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.373
Now you listen to me.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.418
Frank was a hell of a guy.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.461
We were going to accomplish
great things together.

15:21.503 --> 15:25.174
But this is too damn important
for the future of this country.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.550
A future that includes you.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.762
The past is just that.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.449
Hold on a second.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.204
Do you work for the brother or the sister?

15:55.621 --> 15:56.622
The family.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.168
She's not that fond of you.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.132
I wanted you to know.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.093
What? That I was working for them
all along?

16:09.927 --> 16:12.763
One way or another,
Francis got both of us hired.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.224
We know you've been meeting
with Tom Hammerschmidt.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.230
You need to stay away
from him for a while.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.693
God, this thing takes forever.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.655
I have done nothing wrong.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.200
And I'll tell you something,
I am going to expose her.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.576
And yourself.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.161
And then where will you be?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.330
- You're not thinking, Mark.
- What happened?

16:38.414 --> 16:40.892
Did she get to you? She got to you,
is that what you're saying?

16:40.916 --> 16:43.627
I'm saying something's changed
in those steely blue eyes of hers.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.711
Walk away.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.755
My recommendation is walk away
from this shit show.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.007
No. I'm not doing that.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.844
You never even wanted this.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.513
And now you're willing
to fight to the death for it?

16:54.805 --> 16:56.245
Who said anything about "the death?"

17:00.561 --> 17:01.854
Fuck her, Jane. Fuck!

17:07.276 --> 17:08.359
Fuck her.

17:16.952 --> 17:21.790
Forgive me,
but why is your timing always off?

17:24.917 --> 17:26.377
I tried to get you out.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.547
Out.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.341
What a quaint concept.

17:32.843 --> 17:36.263
When the only way out
was never to get in in the first place.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.479
- I swore. I swore.
- Ow!

17:43.937 --> 17:46.940
I swore I would never set foot
in this house again.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.447
What the hell are you doing here?

17:56.283 --> 17:58.702
The optics are awful, Mark.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.165
I mean, really.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.084
It's the only place I feel safe.

18:08.462 --> 18:12.049
That looks lovely.
I don't blame her for choosing it.

18:12.716 --> 18:17.096
And that blue-green color,
it's so specific to the French Alps.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.265
Azure, yes, azure.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.353
Well, of course
our little tariff agreement

18:24.436 --> 18:26.605
caused some consternation, Viktor,

18:27.439 --> 18:30.234
but I don't regret it.
Tell me you don't, either.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.115
Right now?

18:36.907 --> 18:38.117
Nothing, really.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.327
Just planning for the future.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.207
Out with the old.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.003
Yeah.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.215
And exactly who the fuck was
Jennifer Baumgarten 72 hours ago?

18:54.508 --> 18:56.969
Because I want you to push
for a special prosecutor.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.430
Or... Well, hearings then.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.225
Because it will if you...

19:03.308 --> 19:06.069
Mitch, don't give me that.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.272
It will if you do.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.650
Because I was a Republican a lot longer
than I was a Democrat. You know it.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.921
- Listen to me, Mitch...
<i>- Considering the latest revelations</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:17.739
<i>regarding the vice president,
there's no denying it.</i>

19:17.823 --> 19:20.701
<i>These are serious allegations
that cannot be ignored.</i>

19:20.784 --> 19:24.288
<i>And something tells me
this is just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

19:24.371 --> 19:26.039
<i>I mean, how deep does this go?</i>

19:26.123 --> 19:27.892
- What? I'll call you back.
<i>- And to what end?</i>

19:27.916 --> 19:30.311
<i>- We deserve to know. Look...</i>
- 'Cause I need to call you back.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.130
<i>...people want to associate me
with one party or another.</i>

19:33.338 --> 19:36.175
<i>I'm simply an American
when it comes to values,</i>

19:36.258 --> 19:37.301
<i>way of life.</i>

19:37.384 --> 19:40.512
<i>You have Ms. Stewart meeting
with Tom Yates</i>

19:40.596 --> 19:42.055
<i>in the vice president's home.</i>

19:42.139 --> 19:46.143
<i>Tom Yates, who we now know was someone
the Russians were very interested in.</i>

19:46.226 --> 19:48.187
<i>And now you have the vice president</i>

19:48.270 --> 19:50.355
<i>holed up in that safe house,</i>

19:50.439 --> 19:53.525
<i>- assuring us that everything is...</i>
- Every news outlet is asking for comment.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.485
<i>It doesn't take a genius to realize...</i>

19:55.569 --> 19:58.697
It's terrible how people live
to see others fail.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.325
It's going to be hard for me
to continue here in any capacity.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.160
On the contrary, Kelsey,

20:03.619 --> 20:06.872
I am naming you
my permanent press secretary.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.042
- Ma'am, I ca... I...
- I'm going to announce it

20:10.125 --> 20:12.002
the next time I take questions.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.256
For the time being, though, I think
I should handle the daily press briefings.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.342
I feel like I need
to give them a little face time.

20:18.425 --> 20:19.885
You don't understand, I can't...

20:19.968 --> 20:22.221
I will let you know
when you need to speak.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.850
Don't worry.
We'll get through this together.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.895
Listen, I saw this in my closet today.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.563
And I thought of you.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.565
I want you to have it.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.000
Tom was looking to move back to New York.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.712
We would have coffee,
the occasional dinner.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.423
He told me he was involved with somebody

20:58.924 --> 21:00.467
he couldn't get away from.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.597
That it was killing him.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.226
I can't think about it.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.603
I won't think about it.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.942
What to do about Kelsey?

21:17.776 --> 21:20.195
I mean, look at that face.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.031
Enjoy the bag.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.619
Oh, hi.

21:29.037 --> 21:33.333
So what Melody Cruz just said on the air,
that was your son, I'm guessing.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.335
You need to talk to him or I will.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.713
- Keep your voice down. Bill's resting.
- Where is Duncan?

21:38.547 --> 21:40.716
- Not here.
- Bill. Bill Shepard.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.592
Won't be seeing you today.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.764
Still wearing it?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.853
Why are you allowing me to be gutted?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.856
- Gutted?
- Yes, gutted.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.733
Gutted, gutted.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.777
I told Melody Cruz to run the piece.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.406
I have been nothing but loyal to you.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.201
The press secretary was in your house

22:08.285 --> 22:10.245
- with Tom Yates.
- Oh, my God. Come on.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.956
Even if there isn't an ounce
of truth to it.

22:13.040 --> 22:17.085
Mark, you're the face
of this whole Russia fiasco.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.129
It's bad for the country.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.006
It's bad for Bill and me.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.594
You need to get rid of it.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.140
Burn your house down, if you have to.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.018
Anything that connects you to the story

22:34.102 --> 22:35.937
and get a hold of yourself.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.387
<i>How's the Bureau feeling</i>

22:41.443 --> 22:44.613
about the latest revelations
when it comes to Mark Usher?

22:45.572 --> 22:49.368
It's difficult when all the evidence
is coming from Russian intelligence.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.245
But we have to follow every lead.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.706
To be honest, ma'am,

22:54.790 --> 22:57.334
the vice president
is well-liked around town.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.837
Yes, but we're talking about
very serious crimes here, Nathan.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.339
Yes, ma'am.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.345
So, tell me,
once Doug knew you were listening in...

23:09.221 --> 23:11.431
He's been operating pretty much
in plain sight.

23:12.265 --> 23:14.309
He tried to meet with Tom Hammerschmidt.

23:15.977 --> 23:16.977
Again?

23:17.854 --> 23:21.274
And he met with Bill and Annette Shepherd
at the Hay-Adams.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.237
Also, he returned to his apartment
with a canine.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.614
Doug has a dog?

23:27.697 --> 23:29.199
There's one in his apartment.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.744
Another thing that caught my attention
was the two men we have following

23:32.828 --> 23:36.790
Doug's psychiatrist
from the facility contacted me.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.751
Seems Dr. Rosen was pretty shaken up.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.922
He said he blacked out and fell down.
But I mean, it doesn't make any sense...

23:44.005 --> 23:46.466
- You sound very distracted, Nathan.
- Excuse me.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.237
I don't know if it's the lack of sleep
because of the night feedings,

23:49.261 --> 23:53.223
but I wonder if you're still capable
of doing the job that I expect of you.

23:54.641 --> 23:58.186
I promise you, ma'am, I'm fully capable
of executing my duties.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.106
Boy or girl?

24:03.525 --> 24:07.279
- Oh. A boy.
- Oh. I'm so happy for you, Nathan.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.031
They do say second marriages are the best.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.886
What time is it?

24:31.094 --> 24:32.429
Don't worry about it.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.682
Are you okay?

24:35.765 --> 24:36.975
Can I check your temperature?

24:37.058 --> 24:38.393
No.

24:38.935 --> 24:43.315
Every time I wake up,
you people put your hands all over me.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.818
When I went to bed, I was 53 years old.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.782
I don't know how old I am.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.036
Was Mark here?

24:56.119 --> 24:58.121
I heard these voices,
I was going in and out.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.623
- Seth!
- Bill,

24:59.706 --> 25:02.185
- maybe you should go back to your room.
- No, I'm not dead yet.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.877
Was he here?

25:04.711 --> 25:08.340
- Yes, but...
- Okay. Well, where is Ms. Skorsky?

25:08.423 --> 25:09.716
We have people looking for her.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.885
We're fairly sure she's still
in the DC area.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.261
But what does she have?

25:15.430 --> 25:19.059
We now know that Ray Meyers
was faxing some kind of document

25:19.142 --> 25:21.102
to a copy shop here in the city.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.940
- And anything from your Doug Stamper?
- No, sir.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.276
Bill, please, you're still feverish.

25:30.278 --> 25:33.240
Can you give us a minute?

25:33.323 --> 25:34.323
Of course.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.459
Where is he?

25:45.293 --> 25:46.419
<i>He's safe.</i>

25:47.420 --> 25:49.214
<i>Which is more than I can say for you.</i>

25:50.632 --> 25:54.427
You know, at times I can't tell
if you're making a threat

25:54.511 --> 25:55.637
or offering help.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.807
Why is Seth Grayson looking
for Janine Skorsky?

26:01.226 --> 26:04.229
I'm assuming the men who turned your place
upside down were looking for her.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.356
She's working on an article.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.859
But she'll have to find
someplace else to publish.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.862
Her newspaper was bought by the Shepherds.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.615
<i>We still need to meet, Tom.</i>

26:16.199 --> 26:17.242
Yeah.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.246
And, Doug,

26:22.914 --> 26:25.709
you lay a hand on that innocent animal,
and I swear to Christ,

26:25.792 --> 26:27.460
I'll beat the living shit out of you.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.505
Your dog's fine.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.516
Seth?

26:52.527 --> 26:54.613
I know you look up to my brother.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.198
And you've been very attentive.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.660
But he's not well, okay?

27:02.412 --> 27:03.788
And from this moment on,

27:04.623 --> 27:06.791
any information you think he needs,

27:07.042 --> 27:08.627
I need to hear it first.

27:10.378 --> 27:11.504
I understand.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.049
He will recover.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.052
Thank you for saying that.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.558
Doug Stamper doesn't like
to be told what to do.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.812
It only works if he thinks it's his idea.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.399
Listen,

27:31.941 --> 27:35.945
it may be none of my business,
but I haven't been able to reach Duncan

27:37.197 --> 27:39.324
since he received a package
from the White House.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.659
I don't know what it was.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.703
But he was very upset.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.163
Thank you.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.874
You're right.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.543
That's none of your business.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.473
I urged him. Believe me.

28:03.556 --> 28:07.811
I urged him to resign, but he listens
to me half the time, at best.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.856
I need you to understand.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.653
I don't want to hurt Mark again.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.999
There was a troubled young woman...

28:30.083 --> 28:32.585
I wonder why so many stories
have to begin that way.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.714
I know. I know. I hate this story.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.674
I hate that I'm telling you.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.300
I'm tired

28:39.384 --> 28:41.803
of the disposable girl story.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.515
She started as a volunteer
on Brett Cole's first campaign.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.975
Mark and I were consulting.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.687
Brett's wife was as pregnant as could be.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.774
And the troubled young woman
wouldn't leave him alone.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.652
Well, that's how Brett characterized it.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.489
Did he encourage her attention?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.657
Enjoy it?

29:03.450 --> 29:04.659
You bet he did.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.288
He's a man with a man's ego.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.708
Anyway, of course it became a mess

29:11.791 --> 29:14.085
in all the ways these stories do.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.088
And suddenly,
it was Mark's job to clean it up.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.051
He leaned on her too hard.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.224
Badgered and berated her.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.186
"You're ruining Brett's future.

29:31.644 --> 29:33.396
You better disappear."

29:34.314 --> 29:35.648
And so she did.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.822
She jumped off the Roosevelt Bridge.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.243
It fucked with Mark's head, Claire.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.705
He lost his nerve after that. He...

29:50.789 --> 29:53.082
He started to question everything.

29:54.417 --> 29:55.460
Everything.

29:56.669 --> 29:57.796
Everything.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.840
I'm sorry.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.052
I'm... I mean, this is not me.

30:05.887 --> 30:06.887
Jane.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.935
You're saving him, you know that, right?

30:17.106 --> 30:18.608
Now, tell me the truth.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.319
Did you help Cathy get away?

30:24.739 --> 30:28.159
The FSB have been very helpful,
so you know.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.119
They're very close to locating Cathy.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.963
I've noticed that you always
adjust your hair

30:40.046 --> 30:41.673
right before you tell a lie.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.929
I want you to know I forgive you.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.684
She wants to try and impeach me?

30:52.767 --> 30:55.395
Be my guest, I cannot wait.
They hate her, you know.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.482
The House, all the Senators,
they hate her guts.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.069
By the time this thing is over,
she'll be begging me to...

31:03.152 --> 31:04.696
<i>Don't do this.</i>

31:06.573 --> 31:09.075
Everything I've done for that ungrateful...

31:09.576 --> 31:11.327
<i>Don't let this happen again.</i>

31:11.661 --> 31:14.038
I didn't take proper care of you.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.292
As a friend.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.879
<i>Machiavelli died in exile.</i>

31:21.170 --> 31:26.342
<i>Boss Tweed made a deal with the governor,
but in the end, was never released.</i>

31:26.509 --> 31:27.510
Where are you, Jane?

31:27.594 --> 31:30.263
<i>And Nixon was a prisoner of his past</i>

31:30.638 --> 31:32.181
<i>till the day he died.</i>

31:32.515 --> 31:36.603
<i>All men who had no idea how to walk away.</i>

31:37.645 --> 31:40.356
I am still in possession of his body,
and I'll use it, if I have to.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.150
Oh, God.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.415
No matter what you hear,

31:57.999 --> 32:00.001
I was trying to help you.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.840
Jane.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.221
- <i>It's around the back.</i>
- You did good.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.515
<i>What is it?</i>

32:15.642 --> 32:16.851
<i>What does she have?</i>

32:17.393 --> 32:19.354
You don't have
to concern yourself with that.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.230
<i>I delivered her, didn't I?</i>

32:21.314 --> 32:24.067
Whatever Janine Skorsky has
will never see the light of day.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.568
She has no right to it.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.820
And her source will be singing
a different tune

32:27.904 --> 32:29.584
when he sees the jail time
he's looking at.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.991
<i>Listen to you, Mr. Grayson.</i>

32:32.075 --> 32:34.327
<i>By the way, what's your title?</i>

32:34.410 --> 32:38.706
Vice president of research and outreach
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.

32:38.998 --> 32:40.875
<i>You're like a starfish, Seth.</i>

32:40.959 --> 32:42.418
<i>Your legs grow back.</i>

33:03.439 --> 33:04.774
Here's her article.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.819
- And the emails?
- There's a copy attached.

33:08.736 --> 33:09.904
Seth's on his way.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.782
And Janine says thank you
for the head's up.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.617
He'll bring the cavalry.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.036
Calamity Janine can handle herself.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.373
My dog?

33:45.064 --> 33:46.107
All right, then.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.821
Did you kill Rachel?

33:55.158 --> 33:56.868
I need to hear you say it.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.413
You need it for yourself.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.249
I did.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.044
But you won't find her.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.545
No one will.

34:08.755 --> 34:09.964
Turn yourself in.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.507
Take me.

34:14.385 --> 34:18.139
Point me in the direction
where you left her.

34:19.181 --> 34:22.143
There are people who cared for her.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.643
I cared for her.

34:35.697 --> 34:38.784
Did Francis kill Zoe?

34:41.871 --> 34:45.541
Tell me if Francis killed Zoe.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.293
Is this still off the record?

34:53.424 --> 34:55.301
Will it be enough for you
to know the truth?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.678
Because you're never
gonna be able to prove it.

34:58.679 --> 35:02.517
Tom, it has to be enough, or I walk away.

35:03.226 --> 35:06.521
- No. Someone has to answer...
- Jesus Christ, he's dead.

35:08.856 --> 35:09.857
But her...

35:11.025 --> 35:13.069
You said it yourself,
she's as guilty as he is.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.946
I'm saying, maybe more.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.073
Maybe he did it all for her.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.366
What d'you got?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.077
Do we have an agreement?

35:21.828 --> 35:24.664
I give you the truth,
and you leave him out of it.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.040
I can't do that.

35:30.419 --> 35:32.255
It's not a just world, Tom.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.093
But sometimes you have the chance
to make the right person pay,

35:37.176 --> 35:38.886
even if it's for the wrong crime.

35:41.013 --> 35:42.348
Is that enough for you?

35:43.224 --> 35:45.601
Because if it's not, I respect you,
and we can say goodbye.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.603
- No, Doug. It's not enough for me.
- Tom.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.148
- And I do not agree!
- Tom.

35:50.231 --> 35:54.277
I am never going to tell you
that Francis killed the three of them,

35:54.777 --> 35:55.903
Zoe, Russo

35:57.613 --> 35:58.781
and LeAnn.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.908
But you already know the truth.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.370
Yes.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.792
Yes, I do.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.676
On the record.

36:20.052 --> 36:21.220
From here.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.475
What did she do?

36:28.227 --> 36:29.520
Ms. Skorsky.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.607
Members of the US Attorney
Cyber Task Force are on their way.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.690
I'm giving you a chance.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.902
And I'm giving you a chance
to go on the record.

36:38.654 --> 36:42.575
Emails or any correspondence
written while at Arcas Refinery

36:42.658 --> 36:44.577
or any subsidiary of Shepherd Unlimited

36:44.660 --> 36:47.163
are the sole property
of Bill and Annette Shepherd.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.124
Were Bill and Annette Shepherd aware

36:50.208 --> 36:53.753
of the possibility that workers might die
at the Arcas plant?

36:54.378 --> 36:55.546
Get that outta my face.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.049
We know what Ray Meyers sent you.

36:58.966 --> 37:01.135
Did you use the Arcas accident

37:01.594 --> 37:04.972
to get the citizens of Bellport
to sign up for this app?

37:05.056 --> 37:09.560
An app that you helped develop
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation?

37:09.936 --> 37:11.103
Ms. Skorsky,

37:11.812 --> 37:15.274
they're about to confiscate your computer
and any devices.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.609
You can take it right now.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.030
You're not gonna find anything here.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.618
I knew you were coming, Mr. Grayson.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.460
Doug.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.217
I'm ready to see the president.

37:43.719 --> 37:46.555
<i>You expect a person
to be true to his character.</i>

37:46.639 --> 37:50.268
You're so careful. You're so good
about cleaning up after yourself.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.395
Why didn't you just get rid of him?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.065
Well, Francis wanted it otherwise.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.112
I was so hoping you'd surprise me.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.532
What are you gonna do, Mark?

38:05.032 --> 38:08.786
You gonna pull out the body,
drape it over the tombstone?

38:08.869 --> 38:12.164
Gelsemium is known to be used
by Russian intelligence.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.582
I want you out of my house.

38:13.666 --> 38:17.044
But from what I understand,
you're pretty much a murderer anyway.

38:17.503 --> 38:19.672
You don't normally make mistakes, do you?

38:20.214 --> 38:21.799
But when you do,

38:22.049 --> 38:23.217
they are something.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.721
Was there some hope in you
that the troubled young woman

38:26.804 --> 38:28.014
would do herself in?

38:28.097 --> 38:30.683
That Congressman Cole
would be relieved somehow.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.768
I'd like you
to get out of my house, Claire.

38:40.735 --> 38:44.071
It's important to be
organized and ruthless.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.282
Three piles, I always say.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.242
The stuff you wanna keep.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.078
The stuff you might need later
that you put in storage.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.914
And the stuff you have to destroy.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.887
- Jane, it's me.
<i>- I'm so sorry.</i>

39:07.970 --> 39:09.263
Hey, hey.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.724
I don't care that you told her.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.809
You hear me? I don't care.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.688
I have the worst migraine

39:19.523 --> 39:20.858
of my life.

39:21.650 --> 39:22.650
Jane.

39:23.527 --> 39:24.820
Jane, are you okay?

39:34.580 --> 39:35.748
<i>Are you okay?</i>

39:36.791 --> 39:37.875
<i>Jane.</i>

39:49.387 --> 39:52.556
I almost forgot.
There's always a fourth pile.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.850
The stuff you don't know what to do with.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.353
Can I get you some water?

39:57.645 --> 39:59.230
Something stronger, maybe?

39:59.688 --> 40:02.149
No, thank you. But don't let me stop you.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.778
I take a month off drinking,
come every Labor Day.

40:06.195 --> 40:09.365
Kind of an academic calendar ritual

40:09.448 --> 40:11.492
to prove to myself
I'm not actually an alcoholic.

40:11.575 --> 40:15.246
I'm actually abstaining myself,

40:15.746 --> 40:16.789
at the moment.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.834
For pursuit of...

40:20.918 --> 40:22.586
clarity, I guess.

40:25.714 --> 40:27.299
Would you like to sit down?

40:29.051 --> 40:30.051
Sure.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.145
He's crazy.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.814
Certifiable. You know that, right?

40:43.816 --> 40:46.944
Doug got out of a psychiatric facility

40:47.027 --> 40:48.696
all of a month and a half ago.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.866
And no matter how hard he tries
to revive his political career

40:51.949 --> 40:53.242
or get back in the game...

40:54.702 --> 40:56.912
He's a delusional liar.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.957
And to tell you the truth,

41:00.416 --> 41:03.043
maybe he was a better wife to Francis.

41:03.461 --> 41:07.882
Which is why he was never able
to see things clearly.

41:09.341 --> 41:11.343
I mean, what did he tell you, Tom?

41:11.927 --> 41:15.514
What do you think he told me
that you don't want me to know?

41:15.598 --> 41:20.269
Oh, boy. The fantasies
he must have reported to you.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.063
You need to pity him.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.483
You really do. I do.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.902
Madam President, this type of intrusion

41:27.985 --> 41:30.196
- into a civilian's home...
- Listen, there's no denying

41:30.279 --> 41:33.866
that Francis was a desperate man
who did,

41:33.949 --> 41:36.202
yes, a lot of desperate things.

41:36.619 --> 41:40.998
And I don't know. Maybe towards the end,
he was slightly deranged.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.251
But whatever he did, he did alone.

41:44.793 --> 41:46.670
I was not complicit.

41:51.300 --> 41:55.179
And do you...
Do you remember the last interview

41:55.513 --> 41:57.097
you did with my husband?

41:57.640 --> 42:01.769
And the conversation ended
where he asked you if you'd believed

42:02.102 --> 42:03.479
what he'd told you.

42:03.562 --> 42:05.856
Do you remember how you responded, Tom?

42:06.982 --> 42:08.067
I do.

42:12.446 --> 42:14.365
I said, "Not for a second."

42:19.912 --> 42:21.247
Madam President,

42:22.081 --> 42:23.958
when it comes to your complicity,

42:24.333 --> 42:27.920
I think it's best if we meet
under more formal circumstances.

42:28.712 --> 42:31.507
I'll be sending over a list of questions
to your press office.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.467
You can answer them by mail, email.

42:33.551 --> 42:37.012
Or if you prefer,
face-to-face and on the record.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.533
Hi.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.876
How many years did she clean up after you?

43:08.294 --> 43:10.212
My mother, the housekeeper.

43:16.176 --> 43:18.721
From the second I saw you, Duncan.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.725
Your beautiful little scrunched up face.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.019
Like an old man.

43:27.229 --> 43:29.940
I just knew. It was instant.

43:30.983 --> 43:32.651
We just belonged,

43:33.652 --> 43:36.447
we belonged, we did.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.743
Why didn't you legally adopt me?

43:46.332 --> 43:48.834
I guess, because I didn't have to.

43:49.501 --> 43:50.753
And my father?

43:52.421 --> 43:53.422
Was it...

43:54.340 --> 43:55.883
Oh, no, no, no.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.346
A one night stand.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.014
She...

44:02.681 --> 44:05.351
said she didn't remember his name.

44:17.029 --> 44:18.572
I went to see her.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.659
My birth mother.

44:21.742 --> 44:24.787
She lives not more than
half an hour from here.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.330
Did you know that?

44:26.872 --> 44:27.998
Did you talk to her?

44:29.375 --> 44:30.376
Couldn't.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.171
I couldn't do that to her.

44:35.589 --> 44:36.799
I just...

44:38.425 --> 44:40.135
I just watched her.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.098
How could she let...

44:44.181 --> 44:46.183
I knew I could take care of you.

44:46.266 --> 44:47.976
I knew she couldn't.

44:53.273 --> 44:54.650
If not now,

44:56.068 --> 44:58.404
I hope you can forgive me.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.077
You okay, Duncan?

45:06.578 --> 45:07.788
Help me, Bill.

45:12.251 --> 45:15.629
Who your real parents were,
where they came from...

45:15.713 --> 45:17.631
I never cared about any of that.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.261
Because...

45:24.054 --> 45:25.597
Well, you know why.

45:25.973 --> 45:27.391
Say it.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.394
Who he is, Bill.

45:31.311 --> 45:32.730
I don't need this.

45:33.105 --> 45:33.981
Stay where you are.

45:34.064 --> 45:34.898
- No.
- Duncan,

45:34.982 --> 45:38.861
if you and I are to have any chance,
you need to stay right here.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.909
Bill, say it.

45:46.910 --> 45:49.580
Who he is to you. To me.

45:51.749 --> 45:52.583
Honey...

45:52.666 --> 45:55.043
Who is he, goddamn it?

46:04.553 --> 46:06.221
He's not one of us.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.439
You're a coward.

46:16.690 --> 46:19.401
Letting Claire Hale say it for you.

46:20.694 --> 46:22.321
Well, I hope you die.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.783
Let's go. Now!

46:41.715 --> 46:44.718
<i>The email links
to corporate minutes that clearly indicate</i>

46:44.802 --> 46:46.261
a foreknowledge of hazard

46:46.345 --> 46:48.972
that resulted in catastrophic harm
and loss of life.

46:49.056 --> 46:51.141
In attendance and party to consent

46:51.225 --> 46:52.643
of the corporate policy

46:52.726 --> 46:55.813
was the entity's chief executive officer
William Shepherd.

46:57.940 --> 47:00.651
Arcas Refinery is liable.

47:00.734 --> 47:02.444
As is Shepherd Unlimited.

47:02.528 --> 47:05.864
The corporation and Bill Shepherd himself
can be charged

47:05.948 --> 47:07.866
with involuntary manslaughter.

47:08.283 --> 47:09.868
Expose him as a murderer

47:09.952 --> 47:12.120
and cost him billions in the process.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.457
Is Ms. Skorsky publishing?

47:15.541 --> 47:17.501
Hmm. I made sure of it.

47:20.212 --> 47:22.005
It's a better story once you arrest him.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.008
And the article will justify the arrest.

47:26.385 --> 47:29.263
We can get some lawyers in here and delay,
at the very least.

47:29.721 --> 47:30.597
No.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.601
Then we can make sure
they walk you out the back.

47:32.641 --> 47:33.641
No, no, no.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.186
No, no. I want the cuffs.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.022
President's gone too far this time.

47:39.106 --> 47:40.524
I want the whole world to see.

47:42.317 --> 47:43.485
And my sister?

47:47.823 --> 47:50.909
You could've handed me this anywhere,
why here?

47:51.910 --> 47:53.328
Seemed appropriate.

47:53.829 --> 47:56.164
You never struck me as nostalgic, Doug.

47:57.916 --> 48:00.794
Could this be
about the posthumous pardoning

48:00.878 --> 48:02.379
you've been imagining for Francis?

48:02.462 --> 48:04.006
You don't belong here.

48:06.466 --> 48:09.094
I sometimes worry about your imagination.

48:09.177 --> 48:10.929
Your slavish devotion.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.265
You can't think beyond him. Not really.

48:13.348 --> 48:15.934
I can imagine you not
in the White House quite clearly.

48:16.018 --> 48:17.561
Oh, my goodness.

48:18.854 --> 48:22.524
You keep saying things like that,
I might not be able to let you leave.

48:31.074 --> 48:32.367
What did you do with it?

48:34.953 --> 48:35.953
The will.

48:36.663 --> 48:37.664
Did you burn it?

48:39.583 --> 48:41.209
He left me everything.

48:41.585 --> 48:43.503
You know it, and I know it.

48:43.921 --> 48:47.257
Excuse me.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.845
I get sleepy so early these days.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.307
Oh.

48:58.936 --> 49:01.480
I'm not going to be told
what to do anymore, Doug.

49:02.731 --> 49:06.193
Not by you or anyone or any man,

49:06.610 --> 49:08.528
ever, ever again.

49:09.863 --> 49:11.490
- Thanks.
- No problem.

49:11.573 --> 49:12.991
- Won't be long.
- Whatever.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.008
Turn.

49:30.092 --> 49:31.468
Sit, sit.

49:31.843 --> 49:32.843
Good boy, listen.

49:36.139 --> 49:38.684
- Get down, below the counter.
- Okay, okay.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.894
You do exactly
like I told you before, okay?

49:40.978 --> 49:44.064
Remember, it's all about having fun,
remember?

49:44.147 --> 49:45.827
You be a good boy.
It's gonna be all right.

49:45.899 --> 49:47.418
Just have fun, alright?

49:47.442 --> 49:49.778
Okay.

50:11.299 --> 50:12.899
<i>And in breaking news just in,</i>

50:12.926 --> 50:15.126
<i>we are sad to report that one</i>
<i>of the </i> Washington Herald's

50:15.178 --> 50:18.265
<i>most accomplished journalists and editors
Tom Hammerschmidt</i>

50:18.348 --> 50:21.768
<i>was pronounced dead at the scene
of a robbery gone terribly wrong.</i>

50:21.852 --> 50:23.353
<i>The White House was quick to comment,</i>

50:23.437 --> 50:26.231
<i>as the president had sat down
with the award-winning Hammerschmidt</i>

50:26.314 --> 50:28.233
<i>for an interview only hours before.</i>

50:28.316 --> 50:30.902
<i>Along with her condolences,
the president used the opportunity</i>

50:30.986 --> 50:35.073
<i>to call for greater gun control,
particularly in our inner cities.</i>

50:35.741 --> 50:36.992
Fuck!

50:41.455 --> 50:43.040
<i>The last thing he gave you.</i>

50:43.123 --> 50:45.333
<i>If you don't tell me what it means...</i>

50:45.417 --> 50:47.537
<i>I was kind of hoping
you could tell me, Claire.</i>

50:49.838 --> 50:52.799
Doug, Tom Hammerschmidt is dead.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.259
Cathy, Jane.

50:54.342 --> 50:55.886
Bill Shepherd is going to prison.

50:55.969 --> 50:57.763
Mark has no one to turn to.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.806
It's just you and me.

51:02.309 --> 51:03.309
Gimme a moment, please.

51:23.288 --> 51:27.334
Please know.

51:29.169 --> 51:33.256
The thought of accelerating the exit
of three poor souls from this earth

51:33.757 --> 51:35.467
is beyond painful.

52:14.714 --> 52:16.049
Sorry about that.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.218
Not at all.

52:22.639 --> 52:24.933
I'm not worried about you anymore, Doug.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.896
You wouldn't do anything to hurt Francis.
You're not capable.

52:31.106 --> 52:32.732
And see, the thing is...

52:33.692 --> 52:37.279
whatever Francis left you,
it doesn't actually belong to you.

52:37.863 --> 52:41.616
We entered our marriage with a his,
hers and ours agreement.

52:43.034 --> 52:44.911
You keep
and do whatever you want with yours,

52:44.995 --> 52:46.997
I keep and do whatever I want with mine.

52:47.539 --> 52:50.292
My daddy and mother insisted,
as you can imagine.

52:51.251 --> 52:54.337
But the prenup we had, had a clause.

52:55.922 --> 52:58.133
If ever we have descendants together

52:58.466 --> 53:00.635
and one of us is first to die,

53:01.052 --> 53:04.055
we agree to waive our rights
to everything passed on.

53:04.139 --> 53:05.473
By which I mean,

53:06.224 --> 53:08.143
all of Francis's assets

53:08.226 --> 53:09.895
are entitled to his heir.

53:11.813 --> 53:13.106
If he should have one.
