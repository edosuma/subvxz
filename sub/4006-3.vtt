11:52.667 --> 11:54.875
IN THAT BRACELET,
THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT

11:54.875 --> 11:56.709
WE USE THEM
TO TRACK OUR MULES.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.125
AND IF THEY GET ON
TO OUR SYSTEM--

11:58.125 --> 12:01.250
- THEY'LL SHUT DOWN
YOUR HEROIN BUSINESS.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.000
- WHICH IS A LOT
MORE LUCRATIVE

12:03.000 --> 12:06.375
THAN THE TITS AND ASS BUSINESS,
NADEZHDA.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.041
- GEORGE...

12:08.041 --> 12:11.083
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ACCEPT
GOOD NEWS WHEN YOU HEAR IT.

12:15.750 --> 12:19.375
YOUR NAME IS NADEZHDA,
BUT YOU GO BY NADIA.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.000
- I ALWAYS HATED NADEZHDA.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.125
- YOU SHOULDN'T.

12:24.125 --> 12:27.166
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
RUSSIAN NAME.

12:27.166 --> 12:30.709
DID YOU KNOW THAT
THE GREATEST MEZZO SOPRANO

12:30.709 --> 12:33.500
OF THE BOLSHOI THEATER
WAS ALSO NAMED NADEZHDA?

12:33.500 --> 12:34.542
[crowd chatter]

12:34.542 --> 12:35.458
- NO.

12:35.458 --> 12:38.625
- NADEZHDA OBUKHOVA.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.792
IT WAS SAID THAT HER VOICE

12:40.792 --> 12:43.291
COULD UNLOCK
THE MYSTERIES OF THE HEART.

12:43.291 --> 12:46.250
SHE DIED BEFORE I WAS BORN,

12:46.250 --> 12:48.083
BUT I STILL LISTEN
TO HER RECORDINGS

12:48.083 --> 12:50.500
OF THE SNOW MAIDEN.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.083
MMM.

12:53.083 --> 12:57.667
MY MUSIC TEACHER,
MR. CHILLICH,

12:57.667 --> 12:58.750
HE SAID TO ME,

12:58.750 --> 13:02.125
"ISAAC, YOU THINK
YOU'RE STRONG,

13:02.125 --> 13:04.542
BUT YOU ARE NOT STRONG
IF YOU DON'T FEEL."

13:07.333 --> 13:08.750
HE GAVE ME AN "F,"

13:08.750 --> 13:10.959
SO I PUSHED HIM DOWN
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

13:10.959 --> 13:13.750
I FELT BAD ABOUT IT.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.667
AFTER THAT, MY FATHER
SHIPPED ME OFF

13:16.667 --> 13:19.291
TO A DISCIPLINARY SCHOOL
IN ENGLAND.

13:19.291 --> 13:22.917
NOW I'M AFRAID
MY LOVE OF OPERA

13:22.917 --> 13:26.083
IS ALL THAT'S LEFT
OF MY SENSITIVE SIDE.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.792
I WANT YOU TO GET CLOSE
TO THIS DETECTIVE.

13:31.792 --> 13:35.166
FIND OUT WHAT THE POLICE
KNOW ABOUT VIKTOR.

13:35.166 --> 13:39.083
YOU'LL DO THAT FOR ME,
WON'T YOU, NADEZHDA?

13:39.083 --> 13:40.792
GOOD.

13:43.417 --> 13:44.917
YOU CAN GO NOW.

13:54.792 --> 13:59.125
[rock music and chatter]

14:03.417 --> 14:06.125
VIKTOR IS SMART.

14:06.125 --> 14:07.834
HE PROBABLY TOOK THE BRACELET
OFF THE DEAD GIRL

14:07.834 --> 14:09.417
TO KEEP THE POLICE
FROM GETTING IT.

14:09.417 --> 14:11.709
HE PROBABLY HAS IT
AND IS HIDING OUT SOMEWHERE.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.583
- BUT WE'LL NEVER KNOW

14:13.583 --> 14:16.208
'CAUSE THE SIGNAL DIED
OVER A WEEK AGO.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.583
WITH TECHNOLOGY,
THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.834
FIND THE I.T. MAN
WHO SET THE SYSTEM UP.

14:20.834 --> 14:24.291
IF WE CAN TRACK
THE BRACELET...

14:24.291 --> 14:26.291
WE CAN FIND VIKTOR.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.208
[rock music]

14:32.709 --> 14:34.834
- SO SHE CALLED AND I SAID,
"OKAY, WELL,

14:34.834 --> 14:37.125
YOU KNOW, LET'S, UH,
LET'S DO A DOUBLE DATER."

14:37.125 --> 14:38.458
5:00 P.M. YOU KNOW,

14:38.458 --> 14:39.792
WE'RE LAYING DOWN THERE
ON THE COUCH,

14:39.792 --> 14:42.166
AND, YOU KNOW, I FEEL THIS HAND
KIND OF GO UP MY BACK.

14:42.166 --> 14:50.166
- THIS IS WHAT MY LIFE
HAS BECOME?

14:56.083 --> 15:00.166
TIME TO START PRYING
ONE MONKEY OFF MY BACK.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.417
- GOT A PACKAGE HERE ADDRESSED
TO MIAMI METRO FORENSICS.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.917
- OH, YEAH,
UH, I'LL TAKE IT.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.709
- THERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

15:06.709 --> 15:07.959
THINK I DRUNK-ORDERED
FROM THE HUSTLER STORE,

15:07.959 --> 15:09.500
AND THAT NEVER
TURNS OUT WELL.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.333
[lecherous laugh]

15:21.750 --> 15:23.750
WHAT THE FUCK?

15:36.250 --> 15:37.917
"DEAR MR. GREENE,
WHEN I BOUGHT

15:37.917 --> 15:39.417
"THE ICE TRUCK KILLER'S
HAND ONLINE,

15:39.417 --> 15:40.959
"I ASSUMED IT WOULD BE
IN MINT CONDITION,

15:40.959 --> 15:42.959
"NOT WITH LINES DRAWN
ALL OVER ITS PALM.

15:42.959 --> 15:45.542
PLEASE REFUND
MY MONEY IMMEDIATELY."

15:49.959 --> 15:51.917
YOU HAD THE HAND
THE WHOLE TIME?

15:51.917 --> 15:54.041
AND YOU SOLD IT ONLINE?

15:54.041 --> 15:55.750
- N-NO, I SWEAR--
I SWEAR, I DON'T KNOW--

15:55.750 --> 15:56.917
- AND AFTER ALL
I'VE DONE FOR YOU,

15:56.917 --> 15:58.250
YOU STAB ME
IN THE FUCKIN' BACK?

15:58.250 --> 15:59.709
YOU ARE SO FUCKIN' FIRED!

15:59.709 --> 16:01.083
- VINCE, HOLD ON A SECOND.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.625
YOU GOTTA BELIE--
- OUT. NOW.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.083
I HAVE THE WORST LUCK
WITH INTERNS.

16:23.667 --> 16:27.542
- ONE MORE STEP, AND LOUIS
WILL BE OUT OF MY LIFE FOR GOOD.

16:27.542 --> 16:31.500
NOW TO FOCUS ON WHERE
I CAN FIND SPELTZER NEXT.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.458
[knock on door]

16:32.458 --> 16:34.583
- LIEUTENANT,
I HAVE SOMEONE HERE

16:34.583 --> 16:35.583
WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU.

16:35.583 --> 16:38.583
THIS IS DONNA RANDALL.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.291
- WAYNE'S MAMA.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.291
THE ONE WHO SUICIDED
OUT THERE ON THE HIGHWAY.

16:43.291 --> 16:46.333
- I'M SURE YOU KNOW
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.959
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

16:47.959 --> 16:50.709
- IT'S ME MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.667
I GOT SOME STUFF HERE

16:52.667 --> 16:54.375
THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU.

16:54.375 --> 16:57.041
WAYNE SENT IT TO ME
15 YEARS AGO,

16:57.041 --> 16:58.709
JUST BEFORE HE GOT CAUGHT,

16:58.709 --> 17:01.166
AND SAID IT WAS SOME
SENTIMENTAL ITEMS,

17:01.166 --> 17:03.667
AND WOULD I HOLD IT FOR HIM
TILL HE GOT SETTLED

17:03.667 --> 17:05.667
SOMEPLACE AWAY FROM THE LAW.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.500
- MS. RANDALL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TURN THIS OVER YEARS AGO?

17:08.500 --> 17:10.834
- LOOK, I KNOW MY BOY
DID WRONG,

17:10.834 --> 17:14.792
BUT I WASN'T ABOUT TO HELP
THE STATE OF FLORIDA KILL HIM.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.834
ANYWAY, NOW THAT HE'S GONE,

17:16.834 --> 17:19.041
I FIGURED MAYBE
SOMETHING IN THERE

17:19.041 --> 17:22.250
MIGHT HELP BRING SOME...

17:22.250 --> 17:23.875
[crying]
PEACE TO THE FAMILIES,

17:23.875 --> 17:25.625
YOU KNOW, OF THE VICTIMS.

17:25.625 --> 17:30.000
IT'S MOSTLY JUST JUNK
THAT WAYNE AND THAT GIRL

17:30.000 --> 17:31.875
COLLECTED
ON THEIR LITTLE TEAR.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.875
THERE WAS SOME CASH
IN THERE TOO,

17:33.875 --> 17:36.709
BUT I SPENT THAT
AGES AGO.

17:36.709 --> 17:37.792
- IT MIGHT BE
A WASTE OF TIME,

17:37.792 --> 17:39.625
BUT WE SHOULD HAVE
THE LAB GO OVER IT.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.500
- JUST WHEN YOU THINK
A CASE IS CLOSED,

17:41.500 --> 17:42.333
IT POPS OPEN AGAIN.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.375
- ANOTHER BOOK OF MATCHES
FROM STUCKEY'S.

17:46.375 --> 17:50.583
- YOU WOULD THINK ONE MEMORY
OF THAT PLACE WOULD BE ENOUGH.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.417
- ANYTHING INTERESTING?

17:52.417 --> 17:54.125
- NOT SO FAR.

17:54.125 --> 17:58.125
- ONE TIGHTLY WRAPPED
YOUNG WOMAN'S T-SHIRT.

17:58.125 --> 18:02.417
AND INSIDE, WE HAVE
A LITTLE PLASTIC GIRAFFE.

18:02.417 --> 18:03.375
- HMM.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.208
[clacking]

18:05.208 --> 18:06.750
- HUH.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.875
AND A LIGHTER...

18:09.875 --> 18:12.417
AND A NECKLACE.

18:12.417 --> 18:13.917
- IT LOOKS LIKE
MORE OF THE SAME,

18:13.917 --> 18:15.917
BUT WHY WAS THAT STUFF
WRAPPED UP?

18:15.917 --> 18:18.959
- MAYBE THEY HAVE
A SPECIAL MEANING.

18:18.959 --> 18:21.375
"JANICE."

18:21.375 --> 18:23.750
- THAT'S THE NAME OF THE WOMAN
RANDALL SAID HE KILLED.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.083
- MIGHT BE A TROPHY.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.375
- MEANS WAYNE WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH.

18:26.375 --> 18:29.250
A BODY MUST BE BURIED
OUT THERE SOMEPLACE.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.083
- IF THE GIRAFFE AND LIGHTER
ARE TROPHIES, TOO,

18:31.083 --> 18:32.333
THERE MIGHT BE MORE BODIES
TO FIND.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.417
- HEY, I JUST GOT A CALL.

18:33.417 --> 18:35.291
THE BOUNCER FROM THE FOX HOLE,
TONY RUSH,

18:35.291 --> 18:36.500
THEY JUST FOUND HIM
WITH A SCREWDRIVER

18:36.500 --> 18:37.583
THROUGH HIS HEAD.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.500
- WE JUST INTERVIEWED HIM.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.875
- LOOKS LIKE
THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD

18:40.875 --> 18:42.417
WERE TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE
ABOUT TALKING TO COPS.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.041
- IT JUST GOT THAT MUCH HARDER
TO FIND WHOEVER KILLED MIKE.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.750
- NO MATTER WHAT WE DO,
THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER BODY.

18:47.750 --> 18:48.834
- [scoffs]

18:50.959 --> 18:52.667
- YO, MARY POPPINS,
WAIT UP.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.917
- HEY, DEB, I'M NOT GONNA
BE HOME FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.583
I'M GONNA HIT THE NEW GYM.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.291
[sniffles]

19:08.792 --> 19:10.083
- HEY, BABE.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.625
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

19:12.625 --> 19:14.792
- I'M JUST WATCHING A VIDEO.

19:14.792 --> 19:17.291
WANNA SEE IT?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.583
- IDEA:
A VIDEO DIARY APP.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.417
ONE TOUCH,
DEVICE STARTS RECORDING.

19:24.417 --> 19:28.083
TAP AGAIN, AND IT UPLOADS
DIRECTLY TO Y--

19:28.083 --> 19:29.792
- STILL WAITING.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.750
- YEAH, I'M ALMOST DONE.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.291
- YOUR HOUR'S ALMOST UP.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.291
I'M ONLY THINKING OF YOU.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.166
[zipper unzips]

19:41.166 --> 19:44.166
- OH, GOD.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.000
THERE WILL NEVER BE AN APP
FOR THIS.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
THAT WAS BEFORE
WE STARTED DATING.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.083
- YOU'RE WEARING THE SHIRT
I GAVE YOU

19:52.083 --> 19:54.000
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,
ASSHOLE.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.667
- IT WAS A HOOKER.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.667
IT'S NOT CHEATING
IF YOU PAY FOR IT.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.375
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU ARE A PIG.

20:00.375 --> 20:03.250
IF I CATCH ANYTHING FROM YOU,
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

20:03.250 --> 20:04.875
[clatter]
- OW!

20:04.875 --> 20:07.041
HOW DID YOU GET THAT DISC?

20:07.041 --> 20:09.083
- IT WAS MAILED TO ME
ANONYMOUSLY,

20:09.083 --> 20:10.500
PROBABLY BY YOUR HOOKER.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.166
WHAT DID YOU DO,
CANCEL HER CHECK?

20:12.166 --> 20:13.583
- DEXTER SENT IT.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.709
- DEXTER? HE BROKE
INTO YOUR APARTMENT

20:15.709 --> 20:16.875
AND HE STOLE YOUR PORNO?

20:16.875 --> 20:18.959
- YEAH, AND HE JUST
GOT ME FIRED.

20:18.959 --> 20:20.667
HE'S TRYING
TO RUIN MY LIFE!

20:20.667 --> 20:23.125
- YOU ARE FUCKING CRAZY.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.917
I DON'T EVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

20:24.917 --> 20:26.834
[clatter]

20:28.375 --> 20:29.375
[door slams]

20:29.375 --> 20:30.375
- FUCK!

20:30.375 --> 20:33.417
[seething]

20:40.041 --> 20:42.041
- GYM, HUH?

20:42.041 --> 20:43.834
LYING LITTLE SHIT.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.792
[cell phone rings]

20:53.792 --> 20:54.959
- MORGAN.

20:54.959 --> 20:58.041
- I ORDERED YOU A BEER.

20:58.041 --> 21:01.041
- YOU KNEW
I WAS FOLLOWING YOU.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.083
- I MADE IT EASY FOR YOU.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.709
[phones beep off]

21:08.417 --> 21:10.375
- YOU LURED ME HERE.

21:10.375 --> 21:11.875
- YEAH.
- HERE YOU GO.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.917
LITTLE ATTITUDE ADJUSTER.

21:13.917 --> 21:15.250
- THINK I'M GONNA NEED
A LITTLE MORE ADJUSTING.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.792
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

21:18.792 --> 21:20.291
[zipper unzips]

21:22.291 --> 21:23.583
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS CASE?

21:23.583 --> 21:26.083
- YEAH.
RAY SPELTZER, HE WAS...

21:26.083 --> 21:27.417
GUILTY AS FUCK--

21:27.417 --> 21:30.083
PROBABLY OF TWO MURDERS--
BUT WE COULDN'T PROVE IT.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.083
- I THINK HE'S GETTING READY
TO DO IT AGAIN.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.750
- HE SHAVED HIS HEAD TODAY.

21:37.250 --> 21:40.583
- HIS HEAD HAD BEEN
RECENTLY SHAVED

21:40.583 --> 21:44.125
WHEN HE WAS QUESTIONED
ABOUT ANN FEIG'S DISAPPEARANCE

21:44.125 --> 21:47.417
AND WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED
FOR NINA FLEISCHER'S MURDER.

21:47.417 --> 21:50.709
I THINK IT'S PART
OF HIS KILLING RITUAL.

21:50.709 --> 21:54.792
I THINK HE'S HUNTING
HIS NEXT VICTIM RIGHT NOW.

21:54.792 --> 21:57.750
- HOW THE FUCK
WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

22:00.375 --> 22:03.000
[woman laughs]

22:04.959 --> 22:08.166
- CHRIST ON A FUCKING CRACKER,
DEXTER.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.625
YOU GOT ME HERE
TO HELP YOU STALK SPELTZER

22:09.625 --> 22:11.041
SO YOU COULD KILL HIM?

22:11.041 --> 22:12.458
- NO, I DON'T NEED YOU
TO HELP ME, DEB.

22:12.458 --> 22:13.917
I JUST NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND--

22:13.917 --> 22:16.625
- GOD DAMN IT!
- DEB, SIT DOWN.

22:16.625 --> 22:18.333
- THIS IS NOT
WHAT WE AGREED TO.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.000
YOU FUCKING LIED TO ME!
- NOT HERE. COME ON.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.875
[indistinct chatter]

22:22.875 --> 22:24.542
- GET THE FUCK OFF.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.500
- DEB, I LURED YOU HERE

22:29.500 --> 22:32.500
BECAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF I LET YOU IN ON MY PROCESS,

22:32.500 --> 22:36.166
YOU'D APPRECIATE THAT THERE
IS SOME VALUE TO WHAT I DO.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.875
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
YOU WANT MY APPROVAL?

22:38.875 --> 22:41.375
- I WANT TO CONTINUE
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, DEB,

22:41.375 --> 22:43.667
BUT I HAVE TO BE FREE
TO BE WHO I AM.

22:43.667 --> 22:46.166
- IT IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE
TO BE WHO YOU ARE, DEXTER.

22:46.166 --> 22:48.500
- I'M TAKING OUT THE TRASH.

22:48.500 --> 22:51.500
THE TRASH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE
BE LEFT TO PUTREFY.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.583
- I KNOW I'VE
SAID THIS BEFORE,

22:52.583 --> 22:54.959
BUT THERE IS A LEGAL SYSTEM
FOR THAT.

22:54.959 --> 22:56.291
AND JUST BECAUSE
SPELTZER GOT OFF,

22:56.291 --> 22:57.542
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT DOESN'T WORK.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.041
- IF IT WORKED AS WELL
AS YOU THINK IT DOES,

22:59.041 --> 23:02.208
I WOULDN'T BE SO BUSY.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.000
DAD KNEW THAT.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.166
DAD TAUGHT ME THAT.

23:08.375 --> 23:11.041
- WHAT IS IT
ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LAW

23:11.041 --> 23:12.417
THAT IS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THE ONE

23:12.417 --> 23:15.166
THAT THE REST OF US
AGREE TO LIVE BY?

23:15.166 --> 23:16.709
- SOMETIMES IT IS.

23:16.709 --> 23:17.959
- HOW?

23:17.959 --> 23:19.583
- SPELTZER WOULD HAVE
TO MURDER SOMEBODY AGAIN

23:19.583 --> 23:22.375
FOR YOU TO ARREST HIM.
I CAN STOP HIM BEFORE.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.875
- ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT'S WHY YOU DO THIS--

23:23.875 --> 23:25.875
SO YOU CAN SAVE LIVES?

23:27.041 --> 23:28.542
- THE END RESULT IS THE SAME.

23:28.542 --> 23:30.375
SOME GIRL
IS GONNA BE DEAD SOON

23:30.375 --> 23:31.542
IF I DON'T
TAKE SLTZER OUT.

23:31.542 --> 23:34.125
- BASED ON WHAT FUCKING
EVIDENCE, DEXTER?

23:34.125 --> 23:36.542
A HAIRCUT?
- [scoffs]

23:36.542 --> 23:38.166
- DEXTER, YOU CAN'T
GO AROUND KILLING PEOPLE

23:38.166 --> 23:39.375
THAT YOU THINK MIGHT MURDER.

23:39.375 --> 23:40.583
- THAT IS NOT HOW
I DO THINGS.

23:40.583 --> 23:43.000
- YOU CAN'T EVEN PROVE
THAT HE KILLED NINA FLEISCHER.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.917
- I CAN AND WILL.
I'M NOT DONE VETTING HIM YET.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.250
- VETTING?

23:46.250 --> 23:47.458
- I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU

23:47.458 --> 23:49.583
THAT I WILL NOT
KILL SPELTZER

23:49.583 --> 23:52.083
UNTIL I AM ABSOLUTELY SURE
THAT HE IS GUILTY.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.959
- OH, FUCK.
NO. I-IT--

23:54.959 --> 23:57.542
THIS IS DONE.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.458
AND NOTHING BETTER HAPPEN

23:59.458 --> 24:02.542
TO THAT BALD PIECE OF SHIT
OVER THERE.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.667
- I'M NOT DONE WITH SPELTZER.

24:12.667 --> 24:14.709
I'VE BEEN OUT ROAMING FREE,
AND I LIKE IT.

24:16.667 --> 24:19.709
I JUST HAVE TO FIND THE PROOF
THAT WILL CONVINCE DEB.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.166
[ducks quacking]

24:26.625 --> 24:29.542
SPELTZER WENT IN THAT MAUSOLEUM
20 MINUTES AGO.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.500
[door squeaks]

24:33.625 --> 24:36.500
SINCE WHEN DOES A GROUNDSKEEPER
KEEP THE GROUNDS

24:36.500 --> 24:40.417
INSIDE A PRIVATE TOMB?

24:54.959 --> 24:57.667
WHY IS THIS MAUSOLEUM
SO SPECIAL?

25:15.583 --> 25:18.125
THE LAST BODY INTERRED HERE
WAS OVER 50 YEARS AGO.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.500
IF IT WAS A FRIEND
OF SPELTZER'S,

25:19.500 --> 25:21.625
THEN RAY IS HOLDING UP
REALLY WELL.

25:24.500 --> 25:28.125
[cell phone ringing]

25:28.125 --> 25:30.291
[phone beeps]
HEY, DEB.

25:30.291 --> 25:31.458
- WHY AREN'T YOU AT WORK?

25:31.458 --> 25:32.792
- YEAH, I'M KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF S--

25:32.792 --> 25:34.083
- WELL, I NEED YOU BACK HERE.
I HAVE AN ENTIRE--

25:34.083 --> 25:36.875
- OKAY, OKAY.
YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.083
- NOW, DEXTER.
- BYE.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.542
[phone beeps off]

25:42.834 --> 25:45.166
[loud music and chatter]
- WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

25:50.625 --> 25:52.083
- WHAT'S UP?

25:52.083 --> 25:54.750
- FORTUNATELY, WE SET UP
A SECURE CLOUD FRAMEWORK

25:54.750 --> 25:56.709
THAT AUTOMATICALLY SYNCS UP
TO THE RECEIVERS.

25:56.709 --> 25:58.709
- SO YOU'RE ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT
THE GPS TRACKING POINTS?

25:58.709 --> 26:01.000
NOW GET TO THE  POINT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BRACELET?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.458
- CHIP KEPT MOVING
AFTER THE GIRL WAS DEAD.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.375
- WHERE?
- VIKTOR'S APARTMENT.

26:05.375 --> 26:07.792
- AND FROM THERE?

26:07.792 --> 26:09.542
- MIAMI AIRPORT.

26:09.542 --> 26:11.709
THEN A MARINA.

26:13.625 --> 26:14.917
THEN EIGHT MILES OUT TO SEA,

26:14.917 --> 26:16.500
WHERE THE SIGNAL STOPPED.

26:19.792 --> 26:22.041
- MAYBE HE TOOK A BOAT
OFFSHORE TO AVOID THE POLICE

26:22.041 --> 26:23.875
AND THEN HE THREW
THE BRACELET--

26:23.875 --> 26:25.667
- HE'S DEAD.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.041
HE'S DUMPED IN THE OCEAN,
LIKE A LOAD OF GARBAGE.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.959
WHOEVER KILLED HIM
LEFT FROM THIS MARINA.

26:35.875 --> 26:38.125
CAN YOU PINPOINT
THE EXACT SLIP?

26:38.125 --> 26:40.625
- I'LL NEED SOME TIME.

26:43.125 --> 26:44.583
- IT'S WORTH THE WAIT.

26:48.125 --> 26:49.083
[knocks]

26:49.083 --> 26:52.250
- OKAY, I'M HERE.

26:52.250 --> 26:55.834
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIRE ME.

26:55.834 --> 26:58.375
- TELL ME YOU WEREN'T
STALKING RAY SPELTZER.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.417
- I WAS AT THE CEMETERY

27:00.417 --> 27:01.542
WHERE HE WORKS
AS A GROUNDSKEEPER.

27:01.542 --> 27:03.250
- GOD DAMN IT, DEXTER.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.875
- HE WAS LINGERING INSIDE
A MAUSOLEUM,

27:04.875 --> 27:07.250
TREATING IT LIKE
IT WAS SACRED GROUND.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.500
I THINK HE'S HIDING
SOMETHING IN THERE,

27:09.500 --> 27:11.041
SOMETHING THAT MAY
PROVE HIS GUILT.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.959
- "I THINK HE MAY"?
THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE.

27:12.959 --> 27:14.417
- WELL, I'D ALREADY
HAVE THE EVIDENCE

27:14.417 --> 27:16.333
IF YOU HADN'T
ORDERED ME BACK HERE.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.834
BUT EVEN WITHOUT IT,
I CAN TELL

27:17.834 --> 27:19.834
SPELTZER'S
GONNA KILL AGAIN.

27:19.834 --> 27:23.750
AN ALARM IS GOING OFF
INSIDE MY LIZARD BRAIN.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.834
- GREAT, NOW MY BROTHER
HAS A LIZARD BRAIN.

27:25.834 --> 27:26.709
- THE AMYGDALA.

27:26.709 --> 27:27.959
THE MOST PRIMITIVE
PART OF THE BRAIN

27:27.959 --> 27:29.125
THAT SENSES DANGER.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.458
HARRY TAUGHT ME
TO LISTEN TO MINE.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.709
- OH, WELL,
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME

27:31.709 --> 27:33.667
IF I DON'T PUT MY FAITH
IN YOUR AMYGDALA.

27:33.667 --> 27:38.500
- BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE, DEB,
DOZENS OF TIMES.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.709
ALL THE MURDERERS
I'VE HELPED YOU CATCH,

27:40.709 --> 27:43.667
WHO GOT BROUGHT DOWN
BECAUSE OF MY HUNCHES.

27:43.667 --> 27:46.417
MY LIZARD BRAIN HAS BEEN
YOUR SECRET WEAPON

27:46.417 --> 27:47.333
ALL ALONG.

27:47.333 --> 27:51.542
YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.875
- YOU'RE FUCKING
WITH MY HEAD.

27:53.875 --> 27:55.583
- DON'T TAKE IT ON FAITH.
I'LL GIVE YOU PROOF.

27:55.583 --> 27:57.500
- I'LL GO BACK AND BREAK INTO
THE MAUSOLEUM, RIGHT NOW.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.834
- NO. IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

27:58.834 --> 28:00.125
AND YOU GET THE EVIDENCE
ILLEGALLY,

28:00.125 --> 28:01.500
THEN I CAN'T
USE IT IN COURT.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.875
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY LESS TRUE.

28:03.875 --> 28:06.000
WHICH IS WHY YOU NEED
TO LET ME DO IT.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.583
- NO. WE FOLLOW THE LAW,
REMEMBER?

28:08.583 --> 28:10.208
I'LL GET A SEARCH WARRANT.

28:10.208 --> 28:11.834
IF THE EVIDENCE IS THERE,
THEN I'LL PUT HIM AWAY

28:11.834 --> 28:13.083
BEFORE HE CAN HURT
ANYONE ELSE.

28:13.083 --> 28:15.166
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
THERE ISN'T TIME.

28:15.166 --> 28:18.750
- I JUST SAID THAT I WILL
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

28:18.750 --> 28:22.375
DO NOT FUCK WITH ME ON THIS,
OR I SWEAR TO GOD,

28:22.375 --> 28:23.834
I WILL TAKE US BOTH DOWN.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.333
AM I BEING CLEAR THIS TIME?

28:27.333 --> 28:28.458
- YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.041
- GOOD.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.166
NOW I HAVE A JOB FOR YOU.

28:32.166 --> 28:33.375
I NEED YOU
TO GO WITH BATISTA

28:33.375 --> 28:34.625
TO VISIT HANNAH MCKAY.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.125
- WHAT?

28:36.125 --> 28:37.375
- WAYNE RANDALL'S
LITTLE SIDEKICK

28:37.375 --> 28:38.500
FROM HIS KILLING SPREE.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.333
IF WE'RE GONNA FIND
THOSE OTHER BODIES,

28:39.333 --> 28:40.542
WE'RE GONNA NEED HER HELP.

28:40.542 --> 28:41.667
- THAT'S A DETECTIVE'S JOB.

28:41.667 --> 28:42.709
WHY DO I HAVE TO GO?

28:42.709 --> 28:44.500
- I NEED HER DNA.

28:44.500 --> 28:45.875
SHE WAS A MINOR
AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME,

28:45.875 --> 28:47.917
SO SHE WAS ABLE
TO GET HER RECORD EXPUNGED.

28:47.917 --> 28:50.834
- YOU'RE GIVING ME BUSY WORK
TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM SPELTZER.

28:50.834 --> 28:53.041
- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT WE FIND THOSE BODIES.

28:53.041 --> 28:55.750
AND, YES, I AM TRYING
TO KEEP YOU AWAY FROM SPELTZER.

28:57.709 --> 28:58.917
- DEXTER.

28:58.917 --> 29:00.125
READY TO ROLL?

29:00.125 --> 29:02.500
- YEAH.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.542
- WE JUST GOTTA MAKE
A QUICK STOP ON THE WAY.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.291
[indistinct chatter
and pumping music]

29:19.458 --> 29:21.333
- YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

29:21.333 --> 29:25.000
I KNOW WHAT YOU PEOPLE
DID TO TONY RUSH.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.291
- EXCUSE ME.

29:27.291 --> 29:29.083
YOU WANNA TALK TO ME?

29:29.083 --> 29:31.375
HOW 'BOUT WE DO IT
IN MY OFFICE?

29:40.041 --> 29:42.750
[woman laughs]

29:42.750 --> 29:44.208
[man speaking Spanish]

29:46.250 --> 29:49.291
- YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

29:49.291 --> 29:50.917
- I'M WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

29:50.917 --> 29:53.500
- AREN'T WE ALL?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.125
DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T
ENJOY OURSELVES IN THE MEANTIME.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.166
HAVE A DRINK,
OR A LAP DANCE, OR--

29:58.166 --> 30:00.959
OR FESTOON A THONG WITH SOME
NEATLY FOLDED DOLLAR BILLS.

30:00.959 --> 30:03.041
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

30:03.041 --> 30:04.542
- SO YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN ALCOHOL

30:04.542 --> 30:07.375
OR LOOKING AT NAKED WOMEN.

30:07.375 --> 30:10.750
YOU MAY BE
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.208
- I COULD SAY
THE SAME OF YOU.

30:12.208 --> 30:13.750
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

30:13.750 --> 30:16.333
- ME?
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

30:16.333 --> 30:17.792
- AREN'T WE ALL?

30:20.583 --> 30:22.959
- SO WE'RE BOTH HERE
JUST KILLING TIME.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.333
- YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING.

30:24.333 --> 30:26.834
KILLING TIME.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.458
- IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

30:31.458 --> 30:33.125
WE'RE BOTH HERE
FOR A DIFFERENT REASON

30:33.125 --> 30:34.291
THAN THESE OTHER
LEERING CRETINS,

30:34.291 --> 30:37.291
AND YET THE NET RESULT
IS THE SAME.

30:37.291 --> 30:38.333
- AND WHAT'S THAT?

30:40.834 --> 30:42.959
- WE'RE FRUSTRATED.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.667
- LET'S GO.

30:53.667 --> 30:56.125
- I HOPE YOU FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

31:00.333 --> 31:01.959
- [slurps]

31:05.917 --> 31:08.750
- SO HANNAH MCKAY.

31:08.750 --> 31:11.166
WERE YOU AROUND
FOR THE SPREE KILLINGS?

31:11.166 --> 31:13.125
- I WAS STILL IN UNIFORM,
BUT I REMEMBER IT PRETTY WELL.

31:13.125 --> 31:16.709
HANNAH WAS, LIKE, 15
WHEN SHE RAN OFF WITH RANDALL.

31:16.709 --> 31:17.917
SHE WASN'T
IN ON THE MURDERS,

31:17.917 --> 31:20.083
JUST A KID WHO FELL
FOR THE WRONG GUY.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.959
SHE TESTIFIED AGAINST HIM
FOR A REDUCED SENTENCE.

31:22.959 --> 31:25.875
DID SIX YEARS IN JUVIE.

31:25.875 --> 31:26.959
SINCE SHE GOT OUT,
SHE'S LAID LOW.

31:26.959 --> 31:28.959
NOW SHE OWNS THIS NURSERY.

31:28.959 --> 31:31.458
- SOUNDS LIKE SHE REALLY
MANAGED TO CHANGE HER LIFE.

31:31.458 --> 31:32.959
- YEAH.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.500
I THINK I, UH, ENVY HER.

31:35.500 --> 31:38.208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.458
SINCE MIKE'S DEATH,
I'VE BEEN THINKING

31:40.458 --> 31:42.625
MAYBE THERE'S MORE TO LIFE
THAN THIS.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.041
I USED TO THINK
MURDER POLICE WAS IT,

31:44.041 --> 31:45.667
BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
OUT THERE FOR ME.

31:45.667 --> 31:48.083
SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING.

31:48.083 --> 31:49.875
- AND SOMETIMES
THERE'S NOTHING MORE EXCITING

31:49.875 --> 31:53.166
THAN GETTING BACK
WHAT YOU HAD AND LOST.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.875
- CAN I HELP YOU?

31:56.709 --> 31:58.667
- MS. MCKAY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

32:00.917 --> 32:03.250
- SERGEANT BATISTA,
MIAMI METRO.

32:03.250 --> 32:06.083
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WAYNE RANDALL.

32:06.083 --> 32:07.750
- WHAT A SURPRISE.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.500
HE'S THE DETECTIVE.
WHAT ARE YOU?

32:09.500 --> 32:11.709
- UH, LAB GEEK.

32:11.709 --> 32:12.834
- THIS JUST GETS
BETTER AND BETTER.

32:12.834 --> 32:14.583
- I'M SORRY,
I'M A SERGEANT,

32:14.583 --> 32:15.667
AND THIS IS DEXTER MORGAN.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.959
HE'S A FORENSIC ANALYST.

32:17.959 --> 32:21.083
- I'VE SAID EVERYTHING I HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT WAYNE RANDALL.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.709
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,

32:22.709 --> 32:24.625
AND I JUST WANT
TO PUT IT BEHIND ME.

32:24.625 --> 32:27.583
- MA'AM,
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

32:27.583 --> 32:30.166
NOW, I COULD BRING YOU IN
TO THE STATION HOUSE,

32:30.166 --> 32:31.417
BUT I'D RATHER NOT
PUT YOU OUT

32:31.417 --> 32:32.375
IF I DON'T HAVE TO.

32:32.375 --> 32:34.583
- FINE.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.083
BUT I HAVE WORK TO DO.

32:42.375 --> 32:45.000
- SO YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THESE OTHER PEOPLE

32:45.000 --> 32:47.709
THAT WAYNE CLAIMED
TO HAVE KILLED AND BURIED?

32:47.709 --> 32:48.875
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

32:48.875 --> 32:50.834
- WE WEREN'T JOINED
AT THE HIP.

32:50.834 --> 32:53.166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID
WHEN I WASN'T WITH HIM.

32:55.792 --> 32:58.917
- CAREFUL.
THE LEAVES ARE SHARP.

32:58.917 --> 33:01.083
- AH.

33:01.083 --> 33:02.667
- [speaking Spanish]

33:02.667 --> 33:04.083
HOW DO YOU STAND
THIS HUMIDITY?

33:04.083 --> 33:06.792
- IF IT BOTHERED ME,
I'D BE GROWING CACTI.

33:06.792 --> 33:08.291
ARE WE DONE?

33:08.291 --> 33:09.750
- NOT QUITE.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.625
WAYNE'S MOTHER RECENTLY
BROUGHT IN A BAG OF MEMENTOS

33:12.625 --> 33:13.625
FROM YOUR TIME TOGETHER.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.125
- LOVELY WOMAN.

33:15.125 --> 33:17.125
- YEAH, WOULD YOU MIND TAKING
A LOOK AT THESE PHOTOS

33:17.125 --> 33:19.500
AND LETTING ME KNOW
IF YOU RECOGNIZE ANYTHING?

33:19.500 --> 33:21.959
- YES. YES, I WOULD MIND,
DETECTIVE.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.166
- SERGEANT.
- SERGEANT, I'M SORRY.

33:25.792 --> 33:28.041
LOOK, I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN.

33:28.041 --> 33:30.542
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE TO LIVE WITH

33:30.542 --> 33:34.208
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
AND...I DESERVE THAT.

33:34.208 --> 33:37.792
BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT I
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE

33:37.792 --> 33:40.583
IS TO MOVE ON
WITH MY LIFE.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.000
- WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILIES
OF THE VICTIMS?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.667
DON'T YOU THINK
THEY DESERVE SOME CLOSURE?

33:45.667 --> 33:49.166
- ABSOLUTELY, BUT THEY'RE NOT
GONNA GET IT FROM ME.

33:49.166 --> 33:51.208
I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
THAT I KNOW.

33:51.208 --> 33:53.291
NOW, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU WOULD...

33:53.291 --> 33:55.125
BOTH JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

33:56.959 --> 33:58.834
- FINE.

33:58.834 --> 34:01.208
BUT BEFORE WE GO,
MY COLLEAGUE

34:01.208 --> 34:04.291
HAS TO GET A DNA SAMPLE
FROM YOU TO EXCLUDE YOU--

34:04.291 --> 34:05.458
- I UNDERSTAND.

34:05.458 --> 34:08.208
I UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT
POLICE WORK THAN I CARE TO.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.000
YOU WANNA SHOW ME
THAT COURT ORDER

34:10.000 --> 34:12.166
IN YOUR BACK POCKET,
MR. MORGAN?

34:20.083 --> 34:23.041
- DEXTER'S FINE.

34:23.041 --> 34:25.542
- IF I WERE YOU,
I'D STICK WITH "MR. MORGAN."

34:25.542 --> 34:28.083
PLEASE BE QUICK.

34:29.375 --> 34:31.000
- I WILL.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.000
- [sighs]

34:35.000 --> 34:36.375
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M GONNA GO

34:36.375 --> 34:38.333
AND CRANK UP
THE A.C. IN THE CAR.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.500
NICE TO MEET YOU,
MS. MCKAY.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.375
- ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA
GET A QUICK SWAB

34:47.375 --> 34:48.667
FROM YOUR CHEEK.

34:48.667 --> 34:49.917
THIS WON'T HURT.

34:49.917 --> 34:52.709
BUT THEN YOU...
ALREADY KNOW THAT.

34:59.542 --> 35:01.208
SHIT.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.208
- YOU DO THIS FOR A LIVING?

35:05.083 --> 35:06.542
- SORRY.
[clears throat]

35:25.792 --> 35:27.875
OKAY.

35:32.375 --> 35:33.458
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

35:33.458 --> 35:36.625
[latches snapping]
THANKS, MS. MCKAY.

35:36.625 --> 35:38.000
- HANNAH.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.291
- NO, YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:39.291 --> 35:42.417
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP THINGS
ON A LAST-NAME BASIS.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.792
[indistinct chatter]

35:53.792 --> 35:56.125
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO CATCH THIS FUCK?

36:01.792 --> 36:03.959
- RAY SPELTZER.

36:03.959 --> 36:06.291
I STILL LOSE SLEEP
OVER THIS ONE.

36:06.291 --> 36:07.917
- I THINK HE'S HIDING SOMETHING
IN A MAUSOLEUM

36:07.917 --> 36:10.375
THAT MIGHT CONNECT HIM
TO NINA FLEISCHER'S MURDER.

36:10.375 --> 36:13.542
BUT I CAN'T GET JUDGE PEREZ
TO SIGN OFF ON A SEARCH WARRANT,

36:13.542 --> 36:16.000
SO I NEED YOU TO WET THE WHEELS
A LITTLE BIT.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.667
- WELL, WHAT'S
YOUR PROBABLE CAUSE?

36:18.667 --> 36:21.250
- THERE'S SOME
CIRCUMSTANTIAL STUFF.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.166
IT'S THIN, BUT...

36:24.166 --> 36:26.000
BASICALLY, SPELTZER
IS SETTING OFF AN ALARM

36:26.000 --> 36:29.083
IN MY LIZARD BRAIN.

36:29.083 --> 36:31.875
- INTERESTING.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.000
- SO YOU'LL TALK TO PEREZ?

36:33.000 --> 36:37.166
- NO, NOT ON BEHALF
OF YOUR LIZARD BRAIN.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.917
- I-I KNOW
IT SOUNDS FUCKED UP.

36:38.917 --> 36:40.709
- LOOK, DEBRA...

36:40.709 --> 36:42.458
I THINK YOU'RE A GOOD COP.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.166
IF YOU THINK
THIS IS WORTH PURSUING,

36:44.166 --> 36:46.166
I TRUST YOU, BUT...

36:46.166 --> 36:47.834
THAT'S NOT GONNA
GET YOU A WARRANT.

36:47.834 --> 36:49.667
HAVE YOU TRIED
GETTING PERMISSION

36:49.667 --> 36:51.166
FROM THE FAMILY
WHO OWNS THE MAUSOLEUM?

36:51.166 --> 36:53.208
- YES, BUT I CAN'T
TRACK THEM DOWN.

36:53.208 --> 36:54.375
- STAY ON IT.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE.

36:54.375 --> 36:58.166
- IF YOU KNEW THERE WAS
A MURDERER OUT THERE,

36:58.166 --> 36:59.375
AND YOU COULD DO SOMETHING
TO STOP HIM

36:59.375 --> 37:01.542
BEFORE HE KILLED AGAIN,

37:01.542 --> 37:03.709
COULD YOU LET IT GO?

37:05.583 --> 37:09.041
- WE'RE THE POLICE, DEBRA.

37:09.041 --> 37:11.166
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.875
YOU COULD PUT A PATROL CAR
ON SPELTZER.

37:20.875 --> 37:22.750
WATCH HIM.

37:22.750 --> 37:24.709
BUT I BETTER NOT
SEE IT ON THE BUDGET.

37:30.709 --> 37:31.709
[door shuts]

37:31.709 --> 37:34.041
[rhythmic beeping]

37:41.834 --> 37:46.458
[beeping quickens]

37:46.458 --> 37:48.083
- THAT ONE.

37:56.208 --> 37:58.667
- NICE BOAT,
YOU ARROGANT ASSHOLE.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.125
TOO BAD IT WON'T
BE AFLOAT TOO LONG.

38:01.125 --> 38:05.125
KISS MY ASS,
YOU GINGER FREAK.

38:05.125 --> 38:08.542
- IS THIS YOUR BOAT?

38:08.542 --> 38:09.917
- YEAH, THIS IS MY BOAT.

38:09.917 --> 38:11.041
THAT'S WHY I'M ON IT.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.542
- [chuckles]

38:14.542 --> 38:15.917
WHO ARE YOU?

38:15.917 --> 38:18.750
- ARE YOU A COP
OR SOME KIND OF SECURITY?

38:18.750 --> 38:19.792
- [sighs]

38:19.792 --> 38:21.417
WHO ARE YOU?

38:21.417 --> 38:22.834
- LOOK, I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU ANYTHING

38:22.834 --> 38:23.959
UNLESS YOU SHOW ME
A BADGE OR SOMETHING.

38:23.959 --> 38:25.959
- WHY DID YOU KILL VIKTOR?

38:25.959 --> 38:27.166
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:27.166 --> 38:28.250
WHOA, HEY, HEY.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.542
LOOK, LOOK,
JUST GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

38:29.542 --> 38:30.959
- I WANT ANSWERS.
- HEY, I WILL CALL THE COPS--

38:30.959 --> 38:34.667
[muffled grunting]

38:37.250 --> 38:39.625
- I AM GONNA
PUT YOUR EYES OUT.

38:39.625 --> 38:40.667
NOW, THE TRICK IS

38:40.667 --> 38:43.458
TO KEEP FROM DRILLING
INTO YOUR BRAIN.

38:43.458 --> 38:45.583
[drill whirring]
- [whimpering]

38:48.291 --> 38:50.417
LOOK, LOOK, I DON'T...
- SHH.

38:51.959 --> 38:54.458
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

38:54.458 --> 38:55.792
LOOK, I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.
I SWEAR.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.458
THIS ISN'T EVEN MY BOAT.

38:59.208 --> 39:01.792
- WHY DID YOU SAY IT WAS?

39:01.792 --> 39:03.917
- IT BELONGS TO THIS DOUCHE BAG
NAMED DEXTER MORGAN.

39:03.917 --> 39:05.375
I HATE THIS GUY'S
FUCKING GUTS.

39:05.375 --> 39:08.375
THAT'S WHY I CAME DOWN HERE,
SO I COULD SINK HIS BOAT.

39:08.375 --> 39:09.792
- WHO IS DEXTER MORGAN?

39:09.792 --> 39:11.500
- LIKE I SAID,
HE'S JUST A JERK

39:11.500 --> 39:13.625
WHO WORKS FOR
MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

39:18.291 --> 39:19.208
OKAY?

39:19.208 --> 39:21.625
NOW, CAN I--
CAN I PLEASE GO?

39:26.083 --> 39:27.792
- YES.
[silencer shot]

39:32.125 --> 39:34.458
- GET RID OF HIM.

40:13.792 --> 40:15.291
[phone rings]

40:15.291 --> 40:16.917
- MORGAN.
- HEY, LIEUTENANT.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.375
THIS IS OFFICER HEWITT.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.417
WE FOLLOWED SPELTZER
HOME FROM THE BAR.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.792
THERE'S BEEN NO ACTIVITY
FOR OVER TWO HOURS.

40:21.792 --> 40:23.166
JUST SEEMS LIKE
HE'S IN FOR THE NIGHT.

40:23.166 --> 40:24.875
WE JUST GOT DISPATCHED
ON A 211.

40:24.875 --> 40:26.125
CAN WE TAKE IT?

40:26.125 --> 40:27.792
OR DO YOU WANT US
TO STAY ON SPELTZER?

40:27.792 --> 40:30.125
- NEGATIVE ON SPELTZER.
TAKE THE 211.

40:30.125 --> 40:31.333
- COPY THAT.
GOOD NIGHT, LIEUTENANT.

40:31.333 --> 40:34.166
- GOOD NIGHT.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.834
IT'S A WASTE
OF FUCKIN' MANPOWER.

40:36.834 --> 40:38.792
- MY FATHER WORKED
SOMETIMES THREE JOBS

40:38.792 --> 40:40.333
TO TAKE CARE OF US, SO...

40:40.333 --> 40:43.083
I DECIDED
THE BEST WAY I COULD HELP

40:43.083 --> 40:44.333
WAS TO LEAVE HOME

40:44.333 --> 40:47.375
SO HE HAS
ONE LESS MOUTH TO FEED.

40:47.375 --> 40:49.792
HE'D BE SO ASHAMED
IF HE KNEW WHAT I DO

40:49.792 --> 40:51.083
TO MAKE MONEY.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.625
- HEY...

40:52.625 --> 40:54.583
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A STRIPPER
YOUR WHOLE LIFE, RIGHT?

40:54.583 --> 40:57.917
- NO, I HAVE BIG DREAMS.

40:57.917 --> 41:01.375
I WANT TO START MY OWN
DOG-WALKING BUSINESS.

41:01.375 --> 41:02.917
- [chuckles]

41:02.917 --> 41:04.250
- NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
RICH PEOPLE

41:04.250 --> 41:07.458
WILL ALWAYS BE...LAZY

41:07.458 --> 41:09.583
AND THEY WILL ALWAYS
HAVE DOGS.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.458
- WHAT'S WRONG?

41:14.458 --> 41:16.000
- I LIKE YOU, JOEY.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.834
I DON'T WANT
TO LIE TO YOU.

41:19.667 --> 41:21.500
- ABOUT WHAT?

41:23.875 --> 41:27.792
- MY BOSSES AT THE CLUB,
THEY...

41:27.792 --> 41:30.625
THEY ORDERED ME
TO GET CLOSE TO YOU...

41:30.625 --> 41:32.709
SO I COULD FIND OUT
WHAT THE POLICE KNOW

41:32.709 --> 41:37.333
ABOUT VIKTOR BASKOV
AND THEIR BUSINESS DEALINGS.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.500
- SO THAT'S WHY YOU SAID YES
TO THE DATE?

41:39.500 --> 41:42.458
- NO, I SAID YES BEFORE
THEY TOLD ME TO DO THIS.

41:42.458 --> 41:45.792
- SO THEN...
YOU DO REALLY LIKE ME?

41:45.792 --> 41:47.750
- YES.

41:47.750 --> 41:50.125
BUT I'M SCARED.

41:50.125 --> 41:52.166
THESE MEN ARE DANGEROUS.

41:52.166 --> 41:55.834
I-I CAN'T GO BACK TO THEM
WITH NOTHING.

41:55.834 --> 41:57.000
- DON'T BE SCARED.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.458
I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU.

42:02.375 --> 42:07.208
LOOK...

42:07.208 --> 42:10.792
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
WE COULD HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

42:10.792 --> 42:12.792
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42:12.792 --> 42:15.041
- WELL...I COULD GIVE YOU

42:15.041 --> 42:17.875
ENOUGH INFORMATION
TO KEEP YOUR BOSSES HAPPY.

42:17.875 --> 42:19.792
- WHAT IF THE OTHER COPS
FIND OUT?

42:19.792 --> 42:22.000
- THEY WON'T.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.542
AND, IN RETURN,

42:23.542 --> 42:26.208
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING
AROUND THE CLUB

42:26.208 --> 42:29.166
ABOUT MIKE ANDERSON'S MURDER,

42:29.166 --> 42:32.709
YOU PASS IT ALONG TO ME.

42:32.709 --> 42:35.125
- I CAN DO THAT.

42:35.125 --> 42:36.875
I'M STILL WORRIED FOR YOU.

42:36.875 --> 42:39.417
YOU SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED
WITH THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD.

42:39.417 --> 42:42.041
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

42:42.041 --> 42:44.291
IF I CAN PROTECT YOU

42:44.291 --> 42:46.000
AND CATCH A COP KILLER,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.583
IT'S WORTH STICKING
MY NECK OUT A LITTLE.

42:51.542 --> 42:53.542
- IT IS A NICE NECK.

43:24.625 --> 43:25.750
[doorbell rings]

43:26.625 --> 43:29.083
- HEY, RICK.
I GOT OFF WORK EARLY,

43:29.083 --> 43:31.250
SO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER.

43:31.250 --> 43:33.542
- AH, WELL, YOU WILL NOT
BE DISAPPOINTED.

43:33.542 --> 43:36.291
I MAKE THE BEST MOJITO
IN MIAMI.

43:36.291 --> 43:37.750
- AWESOME.
- MM.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.083
[crickets chirping]

43:50.041 --> 43:51.417
[door squeaks]

44:00.542 --> 44:03.417
- LOOKS LIKE SPELTZER'S
TAKEN OVER THE FAMILY SHRINE.

44:07.208 --> 44:08.458
NINA FLEISCHER'S
MISSING EARRING.

44:08.458 --> 44:10.417
SHE DIDN'T LOSE IT
IN THE STRUGGLE.

44:10.417 --> 44:13.166
SPELTZER TOOK IT
AS A TROPHY.

44:13.166 --> 44:16.291
IF I TAKE IT,
HE'LL KNOW I WAS HERE.

44:16.291 --> 44:19.542
BUT I CAN STILL
SHOW IT TO DEB.

44:19.542 --> 44:21.291
[camera clicks and whirs]

44:28.458 --> 44:30.875
- NO CELL SERVICE
IN A MAUSOLEUM.

44:33.083 --> 44:34.125
[beep]

44:38.000 --> 44:39.959
- GOD DAMN IT.

44:39.959 --> 44:41.667
[dialing]

44:41.667 --> 44:43.000
[line ringing]

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
- THIS IS DEXTER.
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.458
- HEY, DEX, IT'S ME.

44:46.458 --> 44:47.583
I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW
I'M GONNA BE A LITTLE LATE

44:47.583 --> 44:49.250
GETTING HOME TONIGHT.

44:49.250 --> 44:51.542
YOU'VE GOT ME PARANOID
ABOUT SPELTZER, SO...

44:51.542 --> 44:53.000
I'M GONNA DRIVE BY HIS HOUSE,

44:53.000 --> 44:54.917
MAKE SURE HE'S TUCKED IN
FOR THE NIGHT.

44:54.917 --> 44:58.625
THANK YOU FOR FUCKING UP
MY EVENING, BRO.

44:58.625 --> 45:00.458
[hangs up phone]

45:04.417 --> 45:06.583
- SO, UM...

45:06.583 --> 45:08.834
HOW LONG DID YOU SAY
YOU'VE BEEN HERE?

45:08.834 --> 45:10.792
- A FEW DAYS.

45:10.792 --> 45:13.375
I PROMISE, I'M GOING FURNITURE
SHOPPING THIS WEEKEND.

45:13.375 --> 45:16.125
- I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE
AT LEAST TAKEN THE PLASTIC OFF.
