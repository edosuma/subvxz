WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.433 --> 00:09.933
Ding dong!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.367
We are back!

00:12.433 --> 00:16.332
This time,
things are going to be pure
crazy!

00:20.033 --> 00:21.633
Let's get fucking mortal.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.000
Yeah!

00:26.067 --> 00:28.233
You can fuck off.
Fucking divvy.

00:28.300 --> 00:29.367
Yes!

00:31.800 --> 00:34.867
We're going to be the radgiest
we've ever been.

00:37.367 --> 00:38.867
What the hell!

00:42.367 --> 00:44.800
Ah, fucking yessa!

00:44.867 --> 00:46.500
Aaron!

00:47.533 --> 00:50.133
It's going to be
the maddest of mad tings.

00:53.833 --> 00:55.033
Oh, my God.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.333
This is amazing!

00:59.467 --> 01:02.533
One big fucked-up family.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.033
Cheers!

01:05.900 --> 01:07.833
What has Aaron got himself into?

01:09.933 --> 01:13.400
All I want to do is get in there
and get the job done.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.767
He looks like Kung Fu Panda.

01:19.267 --> 01:22.100
I love Birmingham.
Anything could happen tonight.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.133
Marty didn't come home last
night
and Scott is nowhere to be seen.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.067
Marnie looks pleased to see us.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.200
It's time to concentrate
on me and her.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.667
You're still my Marns.

01:34.733 --> 01:39.067
Me and Aaron are tashing on and
it's
better than I can ever remember.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.400
Abbie's looking fit.
I've decided to crack on.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.067
I was not expecting that.

01:45.867 --> 01:47.800
This is the best night ever.

01:50.667 --> 01:54.233
Me and Aaron are actually
having sex again. It feels so
right.

01:55.933 --> 01:58.167
I should have
a degree in pulling women.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.867
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:00.933 --> 02:03.167
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:03.233 --> 02:06.300
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.433
I'm preened to perfection.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.833
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.667
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.667
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:16.733 --> 02:19.700
My quiff is pure lethal
and my banter is pure naughty.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.967
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

02:35.467 --> 02:36.800
(retches)

02:36.867 --> 02:38.000
Ah!

02:38.067 --> 02:40.667
(retches)
Ah, no.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.667
Would you fuck off!

02:42.733 --> 02:47.133
Last night was pure mint, but
Nathan
is definitely paying for it now.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.800
Morning, everyone.
Ugh, stop that noise.

02:49.867 --> 02:52.700
Last night was fucking
hilarious.

02:52.767 --> 02:57.000
We got shitfaced, butt naked,
Marnie and Aaron hooked up.

02:57.067 --> 02:59.800
The family was on fire.

02:59.867 --> 03:04.100
Is it bad that I enjoyed
not having Scott and Martin
here?

03:04.167 --> 03:05.767
No, cos I feel the same.

03:05.833 --> 03:08.400
Sorry, boys,
but without yous two creating
agg,

03:08.467 --> 03:11.633
we had the best night ever.
But where the fuck are you?

03:11.700 --> 03:14.467
Abbie, did that kiss with Gary
mean anything?

03:14.533 --> 03:17.367
Did your fanny flutter?
I think it was just a fun peck.

03:17.433 --> 03:18.833
It just made me feel good.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.200
Not only did me and Gary
neck on for a dare

03:21.267 --> 03:23.733
but he was also flirting with me
in the club.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.367
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm enjoying the attention.

03:27.433 --> 03:29.533
Hang on, where is Marnie?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.167
She's in the shag pad with
Aaron.
In the shag pad?

03:32.233 --> 03:34.300
I wonder if they shagged.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.300
Ah, God, what a good night.

03:38.367 --> 03:41.300
Jumped into bed with a champion.
That's not why!

03:41.367 --> 03:44.433
Normally when you wake up,
you regret the night before.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.133
Me, however, I don't regret a
thing.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.433
Even if you'd lost, I would have
got in bed. You wouldn't.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.333
But you wouldn't have had sex
with us.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.300
When we made it official before,
it ended in disaster.

03:56.367 --> 04:00.100
I hope we give it another go,
cos
when we're good we're really
good.

04:00.167 --> 04:04.133
It was a mad night. Nathan
spoilt it
by sticking his finger in his
arse.

04:12.367 --> 04:15.100
Last night I stayed in the boys'
room
all by myself.

04:15.167 --> 04:19.500
Scott and Marty still are not
back.
They are fucked when Anna finds
out.

04:25.033 --> 04:29.200
What's the capital of Australia?
Austria.

04:30.433 --> 04:33.200
No, Australia.
I don't know.

04:33.267 --> 04:35.933
Is she for real?
What a fucking idiot.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.100
Canberra.
What's that?

04:39.033 --> 04:41.333
Hello!
Hello, Anna! Anna's here!

04:41.400 --> 04:42.567
Anna's here.

04:42.633 --> 04:45.233
Oh, great,
what does the Grinch want now?

04:45.300 --> 04:47.267
Can't you see that I'm hungover?

04:47.333 --> 04:50.933
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.300
Scotty and Marty
won't be returning to the house.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.500
Fuck! Fuck!

04:58.567 --> 05:00.167
Oh, my God.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.000
Shit, that's bad.

05:02.067 --> 05:05.033
What the fuck? I'm gutted
that Marty's not here any more.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.000
I don't know what to do without
him.

05:07.067 --> 05:09.733
He is the closest friend
I have in this house.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.033
It's a decision that I've made
and that's final.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.667
Fucking hell, lads, yous have
properly fucked up this time.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.267
I better get used to rattling
around that bedroom by myself.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.067
For the good news...

05:23.267 --> 05:25.833
...I want you to promote
Newcastle,

05:25.900 --> 05:28.867
so I'm sending you...

05:30.900 --> 05:33.567
...to Rome.
(cheering)

05:34.600 --> 05:38.300
We are going to Rome.
I can't fucking wait.

05:38.367 --> 05:39.833
Arrivederci.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.433
Who are you calling dirty,
you cheeky mare?

05:42.500 --> 05:45.733
I am devastated that Scott and
Marty
are going to miss this,

05:45.800 --> 05:48.800
but we need to pack.
Onwards and upwards.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.333
(cheering)

05:55.467 --> 05:57.233
Rome is going to be epic,

05:57.300 --> 06:00.500
but that means we've got to
leave
the ducks home alone.

06:00.567 --> 06:03.300
But I'm sure
Anna's thought about that.

06:03.367 --> 06:08.000
All right, then! Yay! We're
going
to Rome, but where is Rome?

06:08.067 --> 06:09.667
Ah, well, who cares?

06:14.900 --> 06:17.533
There's two things to know
in Italian. Pompeno.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.033
What's that?
Blowjob.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.733
That's the one.
And ciao bella. Ciao bella.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.500
(both) Bye, beautiful.

06:30.567 --> 06:32.333
(cheering)

06:32.400 --> 06:33.600
Arriba, arriba!

06:33.667 --> 06:36.600
We've landed in Rome
and I'm so fucking excited.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.767
I can almost smell
the ravioli in the air.

06:42.867 --> 06:45.367
I am so excited about the villa.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.033
Whoa.
Oh, my God!

06:53.100 --> 06:56.867
We pull up to the villa
and it's an old Italian mansion.

06:56.933 --> 07:00.267
I've never stayed
anywhere like this before.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.667
Oh, my God.

07:05.367 --> 07:06.900
Whoa! Whoa!

07:09.100 --> 07:10.733
It's very weird, this one.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.967
The wallpaper's pure shite.

07:13.033 --> 07:17.000
The decor is pure ancient, but
we've
still got one more place to
check

07:17.067 --> 07:18.300
and it better be good.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.800
What we got? Oh, my God!

07:23.567 --> 07:25.033
Wow!

07:25.100 --> 07:27.167
Oh, my God,
it's actually really nice.

07:27.233 --> 07:28.400
This is so nice.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.367
Up on the terrace, it's
beautiful.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.833
You don't see views like this
in Newcastle.

07:32.900 --> 07:36.167
Hello, Italy!

07:36.233 --> 07:40.067
Put your tits away, Sophie. We
don't
want to put the neighbours off.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.200
Someone cheers us!

07:42.267 --> 07:44.233
I can't believe we're in Rome.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.200
I can't wait to get to the clubs
and twerk my arse off tonight.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.900
Right, everyone get ready.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.300
Howay!

07:55.900 --> 07:58.267
I'm single now
so I want you to do my eyebrows.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.667
Gary, what's your type though?
Abbie.

08:00.733 --> 08:02.733
Anyone is your type, Gary,

08:02.800 --> 08:05.900
but I'm secretly hoping
that Nathan might be right.

08:08.167 --> 08:11.033
Round two, go!
Where's the orange one? Go! Go!

08:11.100 --> 08:13.267
Tonight is my first night in
Rome.

08:13.333 --> 08:17.167
Let's see what this place has
to offer and get smashed.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.400
I'm so excited to see what
the clubs are like in Italy.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.400
I just hope
that Rome is ready for wer.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.467
(they cheer)

08:37.067 --> 08:41.033
The club is going off.
Tonight is going to be mint.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.567
It's so good to have Aaron back
and we're so happy right now.

08:59.633 --> 09:02.867
I want it to stay like this
and not overcomplicate things.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.667
Marnie's just said this is the
happiest she's been in a long
time

09:10.733 --> 09:13.300
and it makes it better
that it's because of me.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.900
When we were in a relationship
before
it didn't end well.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.333
We're best friends.
I don't want to lose him.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.533
Aaron and Marnie have literally
gone
straight back to each other.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.800
I'm happy for Aaron because he
cares
about her, but I've lost my
wingman.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.633
Oh, my God.

09:53.700 --> 09:57.533
Gary, you're a bad man,
but I like it.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.267
You know what it is?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.867
The night is young,
Abbie's looking good.

10:02.933 --> 10:06.100
If none of these Italian girls
are up for it, you never know.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.833
I am having such a belter night.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.533
These Italians definitely
know how to party.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.967
It's a shame Marty's not here.
He would have fucking loved it.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.700
Gary is turning on the charm
again,

10:25.767 --> 10:28.633
and I'm not going to lie,
I kind of like it.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.500
This is getting interesting.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.000
The old Gaz would have
been in his element.

10:38.067 --> 10:41.167
There's loads of Italian birds,
but he's grafting Abbie.

10:41.233 --> 10:43.833
That kiss must have been
fucking special.

10:46.267 --> 10:50.267
What are you suggesting, Gary?
Let's just see how the night
goes.

11:03.567 --> 11:07.733
Our first night hasn't
disappointed.
We're all mortal.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.633
It's time to get in a cab
and get home.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.133
Really?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.867
Have they honestly just left
Abbie
asleep in a taxi?

11:27.933 --> 11:29.700
Piggyback. Piggyback.

11:30.533 --> 11:35.133
I am absolutely mortal
and Gary is being a gentleman

11:35.200 --> 11:37.567
and who doesn't love a gent?
I know I do.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.100
No. On that bed.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.800
That bed.
Ow!

11:48.067 --> 11:49.633
Aaron!
What?

11:49.700 --> 11:51.167
Get in here now!

11:51.233 --> 11:53.467
I'm hanging with Gaz
after a wicked night

11:53.533 --> 11:56.833
and then all of a sudden
Marnie's on my case. What now?

11:56.900 --> 12:01.967
Marnie, I've actually lost it.
Oh, the lip gloss is gone.

12:02.033 --> 12:03.567
I have.

12:03.633 --> 12:06.633
When I left the club
I had my favourite lip gloss
with us

12:06.700 --> 12:09.400
and I'm sure Aaron told us
he would look after it.

12:09.467 --> 12:13.067
You actually have, haven't you?
I never want to speak to you
again.

12:13.133 --> 12:17.267
I can't believe he fucking lost
it.
He had one job!

12:25.533 --> 12:27.533
What is it with Marnie
sometimes?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.333
The pettiest little thing
always ends up a big deal.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.133
I'll buy you a new one.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.000
I'm not your boyfriend!

12:37.067 --> 12:40.000
You're not going to be
if you keep carrying on like
this.

12:40.067 --> 12:42.933
One job. Just one.
Why can't you do it right?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.367
It's my favourite one. (cries)

12:48.667 --> 12:53.167
Marnie always blames Aaron
for the smallest little things.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.733
She never takes responsibility
for anything.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.400
It hasn't taken her a while
to slip back into her old ways.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.200
Marns is still pissed off at us.

13:08.267 --> 13:10.367
Who wants to come to Newcastle?

13:10.433 --> 13:11.833
You look like a giant turd.

13:11.900 --> 13:15.800
I can see this fucking fit
Italian bird.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.700
Wait a second!
Oh, my God! Hi!

13:17.767 --> 13:19.767
Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

13:22.000 --> 13:22.200
.

13:24.700 --> 13:24.900
.

13:39.633 --> 13:41.700
I like how all us girls
are in this bed.

13:41.767 --> 13:45.267
It's like a slumber party.
You screamed about your lip
gloss.

13:45.333 --> 13:48.500
I've woke up this morning
feeling a little bit
embarrassed.

13:48.567 --> 13:51.067
I think I cried over a lip gloss
last night.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.767
I hope Aaron's not mad at us.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.500
Abbie, how was your night?

13:55.567 --> 13:58.033
Really good, what I can
remember.
Gary was...

13:58.100 --> 14:00.567
Was he flirting?
Telling me I looked pretty.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.033
Like, "What's going on?"

14:02.100 --> 14:05.000
I like Gary and I like the fact
that he's having a flirt,

14:05.067 --> 14:07.467
but after Scott dicked me around
last time

14:07.533 --> 14:11.867
if I get with another lad in
this house, it will be on my
terms.

14:11.933 --> 14:15.300
Nothing wrong with a bit
of flirting. You can have a
flirt.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.233
Me and boys wake up
and we're absolutely hanging

14:22.300 --> 14:25.767
so we're going to go outside in
the garden and take in the
scenery.

14:25.833 --> 14:29.100
I mean, it is a very,
very old house, like.

14:29.167 --> 14:32.533
It was built in 2500.
What?

14:32.600 --> 14:35.900
The house was built in 2500.
That would be in the future.

14:35.967 --> 14:38.600
Nathan's either still pissed
or dopey as fuck.

14:38.667 --> 14:42.200
2500 hasn't even happened yet,
you dozy twat.

14:42.267 --> 14:47.400
I was far too fucked last night,
so I didn't even know what
happened.

14:47.467 --> 14:50.800
Basically, Marnie gave him her
lip gloss to look after.

14:50.867 --> 14:54.600
Somehow lost the lip gloss when
we're
leaving the club to get back.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.967
She's like, "I trusted others
with it. They haven't lost it".

14:58.033 --> 15:00.367
I was like,
"It's a fucking lip gloss".

15:00.433 --> 15:02.400
She went a step too far then.

15:02.467 --> 15:05.100
Last night, Marnie was being
a typical drunk diva

15:05.167 --> 15:08.533
and kicked off over nothing.
I've got nothing to apologise
for,

15:08.600 --> 15:10.933
so it's up to her
to apologise to me.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.367
I'll just speak to her.
I'm gonna say I want an apology.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.233
(phone rings)

15:16.300 --> 15:17.600
Phone!

15:17.667 --> 15:18.733
Anna.

15:20.700 --> 15:25.300
Ah, no! Not work.
Please, please, don't let it be
me.

15:26.533 --> 15:27.833
Hello.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.400
"Hi, Gary.
Today I have a job for you
guys."

15:30.467 --> 15:31.700
Yeah?

15:31.767 --> 15:35.100
Fuck, I forgot
we actually had work out here.

15:35.167 --> 15:38.000
"I need you to promote the Toon
to the people of Rome."

15:38.067 --> 15:39.733
Right.
"I want you to take

15:39.800 --> 15:43.733
one of the toon's most famous
landmarks to one of Rome's."

15:43.800 --> 15:47.033
What is Anna on about,
a famous Geordie landmark?

15:47.100 --> 15:49.167
The only one I know is Bijou!

15:49.233 --> 15:52.100
"Can you tell Abbie, Chloe
and Nathan they need to head

15:52.167 --> 15:53.800
to the Colosseum, please?"

15:53.867 --> 15:57.233
I will do. I'll tell them now.
"Ciao, ciao." Bye, bye.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.667
Gaz, he's allowing this.
(they laugh)

16:00.733 --> 16:02.800
Girls! Girls!

16:02.867 --> 16:04.667
What do you want?

16:04.733 --> 16:07.267
There is work today.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.967
Chloe...
Yay!

16:09.033 --> 16:10.700
...Abbie...
Yes!

16:10.767 --> 16:14.567
...and Nathan. And you've got to
be
ready, Nathan, as quick as
possible

16:14.633 --> 16:18.333
because yous three
have got to be at the Colosseum.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.767
Aah!
Aahh! What's a Colosseum?

16:20.833 --> 16:23.467
Is that one of them mega clubs
in Ibiza?

16:23.533 --> 16:25.900
Bye, boys, love you so much,
bye.

16:25.967 --> 16:28.400
Sometimes, Anna, I fucking love
you.

16:28.467 --> 16:31.567
We're going to the Colosseum!

16:44.633 --> 16:46.033
I'm excited to learn a bit.

16:46.100 --> 16:49.167
I feel like I need to educate
myself for when I have kids.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.833
I can go, "Kids,
I went to the Colossenium."

16:51.900 --> 16:54.200
Colosseum.
Colosseum. Aye.

16:54.267 --> 16:58.700
I'm so excited to be working in
Rome
today, but what is Anna on
about?

16:58.767 --> 17:01.667
A Toon landmark.
What has she got up her sleeve?

17:03.167 --> 17:06.032
I'm so pleased we're not at
work.
I'm hanging, dying.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.633
It's the last thing I'd want.

17:07.700 --> 17:12.032
Thank fuck I'm not working.
Going
to see the sights is so much
better.

17:12.099 --> 17:15.133
At least it would be
if Marnie and Aaron were
speaking.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.032
This car journey is fucking
awkward.

17:19.833 --> 17:23.300
This is going to be a long day
if Marnie is still pissed off at
us.

17:23.367 --> 17:26.900
All she needs to do is apologise
and we'll enjoy this city
together.

17:41.967 --> 17:44.000
Oh, my God.

17:44.067 --> 17:46.633
How did they make it, man?
It doesn't make sense.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.300
I couldn't tell you what it is,
what it's for

17:49.367 --> 17:51.933
but it looks fucking amazing.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.300
I don't think
I've seen anything so big.

17:54.367 --> 17:56.967
I feel really, really awkward
with Aaron.

17:57.033 --> 17:59.133
I shouldn't.
It was only a lip gloss.

17:59.200 --> 18:03.000
I'm sorry about overreacting
over the lip gloss last night.

18:03.067 --> 18:06.467
I'm sorry for losing it.
It was an accident. OK.

18:06.533 --> 18:11.200
Wow, Marnie's broke the ice.
She must be really into Aaron

18:11.267 --> 18:13.833
because that takes a lot
for her to do.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.933
Do you wanna go for a drink
later
just me and you? OK. Yeah?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.267
I love spending time with
Marnie,
so this date should be fun,

18:20.333 --> 18:23.767
and hopefully we'll have
a chat about where we're at.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.800
Come to Newcastle, I dare you.
No, obviously not.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.800
I'll give you a...

18:30.867 --> 18:33.433
Do you want to come to
Newcastle?
No? OK.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.600
We are trying to sell
Newcastle to the people of Rome

18:36.667 --> 18:39.433
and so far we're doing
a very shit job.

18:39.500 --> 18:43.200
Where the fuck is Chloe?
She's taking the piss.

18:43.267 --> 18:46.933
Me and Nathan are grafting
in the heat, but where's Chloe?

18:47.000 --> 18:50.600
She must have gone all the way
back to Newcastle for this
landmark.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.633
(Chloe laughs)

18:53.533 --> 18:56.000
Good fucking Lord.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.967
Oh, my God.
What do you think?

18:59.033 --> 19:02.233
Anna has given us this pure
dodgy Angel of the North
costume.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.200
Thank God I'm not in the Toon.

19:04.267 --> 19:06.633
I would not be seen dead
in this piece of shit!

19:06.700 --> 19:09.267
Who wants to come to Newcastle?!

19:09.333 --> 19:12.267
No one, Chloe.
You look like a giant turd.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.100
It's too hot to do this shit.

19:14.167 --> 19:17.867
You're not dressed as the Angel
of the North in 50 Fahrenheit
heat!

19:17.933 --> 19:19.000
I'm sweating!

19:19.067 --> 19:23.667
This promotional shit isn't
going
well. No-one is interested in
me.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.767
Everyone is interested
in this crumbled-up building

19:26.833 --> 19:29.667
what is as old as Anna.
I need to up my game, like.

19:29.733 --> 19:34.167
Oh, my God, Newcastle is the
best!
It's on the fucking north west!

19:34.233 --> 19:36.100
It's the north east, you divvy.

19:36.167 --> 19:39.600
Even I know that
and I got an E in Geography.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.267
Hi!
Oh, hi, guys!

19:42.333 --> 19:44.333
Chloe, what has Anna done to
you?

19:44.400 --> 19:48.067
You are the only idiot in the
world
I know who would wear that.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.433
But fair play.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.333
Right, I am sweating my tits
off.
I would love a drink.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.467
I think I deserve one.
Me and Marns are gonna go have
food.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.133
Gary suggests that everyone
goes for a drink.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.433
But on this occasion
I'm going to say no

20:01.500 --> 20:03.767
because Marnie is taking me
on a date.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.533
Bye.
Bye, guys!

20:05.600 --> 20:07.267
See yous.
Bye.

20:13.933 --> 20:17.200
Let's just go for a nice pint
here.
Yeah, looks nice.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.500
What does "when in Rome" mean?
I keep saying it.

20:21.567 --> 20:25.400
Maybe it's like when we say
why-aye.
Maybe it's their why-aye.

20:25.467 --> 20:29.267
I'll tell you what it means.
When in Rome, have wine.

20:29.333 --> 20:32.100
Cheers. When in Rome.
(all) When in Rome!

20:32.167 --> 20:34.367
We're sitting having a glass of
wine

20:34.433 --> 20:37.267
and I can see
this fucking fit Italian bird.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.933
Wait a second, is that Elettra?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.367
Oh, hi!
Oh, my God, hi!

20:43.433 --> 20:44.667
I'm back!

20:44.733 --> 20:46.567
Hi!

20:46.633 --> 20:49.067
Yes! Oh, yes!

20:49.133 --> 20:52.167
All right, Gary, calm down,
it's only Elettra.

20:52.233 --> 20:55.300
You're not going to get
anywhere near her. Marty failed.

20:55.367 --> 20:58.000
The only person that got close
to her was Chloe.

20:58.067 --> 21:01.933
So, Anna told me that you are
here
and I miss you so I came!

21:02.000 --> 21:03.900
Aw, we missed you.

21:03.967 --> 21:06.967
Elettra is looking a lot fitter
than I remember.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.767
Marty will be gutted he's not
here

21:09.833 --> 21:12.867
but he shouldn't have pissed off
Anna
and got sacked.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.400
This is nice.
Isn't it?

21:19.467 --> 21:22.867
Oh, my God, it's so pretty.
If them cranes weren't there.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.700
Oh, here we go. Hi.

21:25.567 --> 21:29.033
Me and Marns have gone to this
restaurant. The sun is setting.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.467
It's one of the most romantic
experiences we've ever shared.

21:32.533 --> 21:35.433
Have we ever done this before?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.700
Nah.

21:36.767 --> 21:38.300
We haven't, have we?
Nah.

21:38.367 --> 21:41.333
This date is amazing
and it's the perfect opportunity

21:41.400 --> 21:44.267
for me and Aaron to talk
about what is going on with us.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.400
What would you say is going on?

21:46.467 --> 21:50.500
Dating? Sleeping with each
other?
Cuddle partners?

21:50.567 --> 21:51.633
Cuddle partners?

21:51.700 --> 21:54.600
Howay, that's not even a thing,
you fucking divvy.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.400
I would say dating.

21:56.467 --> 21:59.533
Would you? You are like
my best friend, you know that.

22:01.067 --> 22:03.500
Best friend that
puts his willy in your mouth.

22:03.567 --> 22:06.233
I love nothing more
than when me and Aaron get on

22:06.300 --> 22:08.833
because when we are,
we're so great together.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.533
I like where we are. Do you?

22:10.600 --> 22:13.600
It's the happiest I've felt
in a really long time.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.333
Gary's freshly single.
Mm-hmm. Would you kiss him?

22:19.400 --> 22:22.300
Me and Chloe are going
to catch up with Elettra

22:22.367 --> 22:25.367
and yes, Gary, of course
I'll put in a good word for you.

22:25.433 --> 22:26.967
I don't know. I... I'm...

22:27.033 --> 22:29.633
Ooh, you don't know.
That means you might do.

22:30.533 --> 22:33.367
You fancy her, don't you?
I think she's wicked.

22:33.433 --> 22:36.400
What happened to Abbie?
Do you not fancy her any more?

22:36.467 --> 22:38.633
What are you going to do?

22:38.700 --> 22:40.900
She does like girls,
but I could neck on.

22:40.967 --> 22:42.700
Don't get jealous, Abbie.

22:42.767 --> 22:46.467
Don't flatter yourself, Gary,
I am not jealous.

22:46.533 --> 22:50.500
You're the one that's been
flirting
with me. What is it with blokes?

22:50.567 --> 22:54.333
Right, enough talking.
Let's go see the others and get
back.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.500
I want to get drunk,
go out and crack on.

22:56.567 --> 22:59.667
You mean, let's go see your
bird.
Let's go and see my lass.

22:59.733 --> 23:02.267
So, are you going to be helping
us
at work then?

23:02.333 --> 23:03.633
We have to work?

23:03.700 --> 23:05.033
Oh, yeah.
Of course.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.333
Yous. Howay.
Shall we go back to the house?

23:10.867 --> 23:13.533
You know what this
is really reminding us of?

23:13.600 --> 23:17.667
Have you seen Lady and the
Tramp?
I've always wanted to do this.

23:17.733 --> 23:20.300
Pass the fucking spaghetti
and let's do it!

23:27.267 --> 23:30.800
That is not as romantic
as it is in the film.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.233
Me and Marnie have had
an amazing date.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.767
All we've done is laughed.

23:34.833 --> 23:37.700
Let's get back,
get ready and go out tonight.

23:44.767 --> 23:46.900
Maybe I can play with him too.

23:50.767 --> 23:52.800
It's mission Cockblock Gary.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.733
Chloe, fuck off!

23:55.800 --> 23:57.800
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

24:00.467 --> 24:00.667
.

24:03.200 --> 24:03.400
.

24:15.933 --> 24:17.267
Hi!
Hi!

24:17.333 --> 24:19.467
Hello, Elettra!

24:19.533 --> 24:22.800
We get back and, oh, my God,
Elettra's here!

24:22.867 --> 24:24.967
This is mint.
The girl's a party animal.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.867
Going to be fun and games
tonight.
Bring it on.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.133
Let's go get ready.
Come on, Elettra.

24:39.467 --> 24:41.967
Last time Elettra was here
I had a girlfriend.

24:42.033 --> 24:43.667
I didn't look at her that way.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.867
But she came in with that tight
dress on, arse sticking out.

24:46.933 --> 24:48.200
I'm like, mmm!

24:48.267 --> 24:51.367
I am buzzing for tonight.
Elettra is fun and she's fit.

24:51.433 --> 24:55.000
I've been grafting Abbie.
I forgot how fun being single
was.

24:55.067 --> 24:56.067
Howay, lads!

24:56.133 --> 24:59.900
Come on, boys, hurry the fuck
up.
We're sick of waiting for you,
man!

25:00.900 --> 25:03.133
This is nice.
The family's increasing.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.567
Well, it's good to have Elettra
in the family cos you're Italian

25:06.633 --> 25:08.900
so that means we're all Italian.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.933
Cheers to Italian family!
Salute!

25:11.000 --> 25:12.800
(all) Salute!

25:14.733 --> 25:17.333
I am so excited
because tonight is my first
night

25:17.400 --> 25:19.367
and I can't wait to go to party.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.833
This club is even better
than last night.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.033
Let's hope they keep getting
better.

25:47.333 --> 25:50.667
It's so great to see Marnie
and Aaron in a good place.

25:50.733 --> 25:54.700
Last time when they were in a
relationship it ended in a
disaster,

25:54.767 --> 25:57.433
so let's hope
they can make things work.

26:14.833 --> 26:17.133
Gary was flirting
with me last night.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.600
As soon as Elettra's turned up,
he's all over her.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.000
Two can play that game.

26:29.700 --> 26:32.600
I have got nae time
for dancing tonight, like.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.500
It's mission Cockblock Gary.

26:34.567 --> 26:36.700
He needs to be taught
a fucking lesson.

26:51.667 --> 26:54.467
I'm about to talk to Elettra
and all of a sudden

26:54.533 --> 26:58.233
Chloe and Abbie are all over
Elettra.
Have I missed something?

27:04.633 --> 27:08.900
Fuck this, I am just going to go
over
and talk to Elettra.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.367
What's the matter? I'm not
intruding,
am I? How do you like them
apples?

27:18.033 --> 27:19.800
Chloe, fuck off!

27:29.100 --> 27:32.033
I feel bad because
I've kind of stolen Gary's
wingman,

27:32.100 --> 27:34.500
so I'm going to step in
and be his wingwoman.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.500
I think I'll be better than
Aaron.

27:40.967 --> 27:44.800
I never thought I'd say this.
Thank
you, Marnie, for being my
wingwoman.

27:44.867 --> 27:47.167
This night just gets weirder
and weirder.

27:51.167 --> 27:55.333
I see that Gary tonight
is so interested with me.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.033
Maybe I can play with him, too.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.533
Gary is not giving up.
He's got Marnie's help.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.300
But, no, no, Gary, neither am I.

28:19.833 --> 28:24.067
Them two are trying so hard. Now
they've offered Elettra a
threesome.

28:24.133 --> 28:25.567
How do I top that?

28:33.667 --> 28:36.933
Gary is all over Elettra.
I need to step up my game.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.100
It's time for the big guns.
Fancy a lap dance, Elettra?

28:45.700 --> 28:47.500
They've taken this to a new
level.

28:47.567 --> 28:50.700
They're lap dancing and Abbie
seems to have her fanny out.

28:50.767 --> 28:52.733
You that desperate to cockblock
me?

28:54.500 --> 28:58.000
This is amazing.
Abbie is such a legend.

29:11.033 --> 29:12.033
Nathan's mortal.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.433
I can't get a word in with
Elettra
cos of them two idiots.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
I've had enough. I'm going home.

29:21.500 --> 29:26.333
Tonight has been mint,
but half of Rome has seen my
vagina.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.367
Oh, well, could have been worse.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.533
Gaz could have necked on
with Elettra.

29:33.067 --> 29:35.367
Nathan, why would you do that,
you freak?

29:35.433 --> 29:37.367
We're getting in a taxi to go
home

29:37.433 --> 29:40.433
and Abbie and Chloe are just
rolling around on the floor.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.967
Ow!

29:42.033 --> 29:44.267
And that gives me
the perfect opportunity

29:44.333 --> 29:46.467
to offer Elettra a ride in my
taxi.

29:46.533 --> 29:50.033
All is fair in love and war
and this is war.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.633
(Nathan) Get in the back!

30:02.200 --> 30:05.100
Driving home,
Aaron's gone from drunk to
mortal,

30:05.167 --> 30:07.367
and I've got to look after
the daft twat.

30:09.067 --> 30:11.167
We get back, and I'm in a bad
way.

30:11.233 --> 30:13.800
I'm so glad Marnie is here
to look after us.

30:13.867 --> 30:16.933
Not on my side, on the other
side.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.633
He's in a bad way.
I've never seen him like this.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.500
This definitely makes a change.

30:21.567 --> 30:24.833
It's normally me being sick
and Aaron looking after me.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.867
Have to admit
I do find it quite funny.

30:26.933 --> 30:29.067
Who's that? Is that Aaron
mortal?

30:29.133 --> 30:30.733
Leave him alone.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.900
I am. I'm only asking
if he's all right.

30:32.967 --> 30:34.433
When you're this pissed,

30:34.500 --> 30:37.567
the only thing that can save the
day
is chicken nuggets.

30:37.633 --> 30:39.567
Nugget?
(Aaron huffs)

30:39.633 --> 30:40.833
Suit yourself!

30:46.267 --> 30:47.467
Ooh, lovely.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.233
Where's Eletrica?

30:51.300 --> 30:54.600
Where's Electric?
Electrica... Electric...

30:54.667 --> 30:56.400
I think she's with Gary.

30:56.467 --> 30:59.867
It looks like my cockblocking
plan
didn't work.

30:59.933 --> 31:03.100
Cos Gaz and Elettra
are in the shag pad.

31:03.167 --> 31:05.000
I just hope nothing happens.

31:05.067 --> 31:07.667
Chloe, you're dirty. Get off me.

31:07.733 --> 31:10.767
You're the dirtiest girl
out of all of them.

31:14.367 --> 31:16.533
Finally, I've got Elettra alone.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.333
It's time to put
all this graft to work.

31:24.267 --> 31:28.967
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You know
that I am the no fucky, fucky
girl.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.233
Shit, no fucky, fucky.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.500
It's just kissing
and cuddling tonight.

31:35.567 --> 31:39.333
You cannot keep a good man down.
There's always tomorrow.

31:47.467 --> 31:49.600
I wanna make a big cock.

31:50.567 --> 31:52.500
I've got techniques in the
bedroom.

31:54.633 --> 31:56.833
What would they do if I pulled
Abbie?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.667
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

32:02.933 --> 32:03.133
.

32:05.667 --> 32:05.867
.

32:18.433 --> 32:20.733
Ah, fucking hell.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.033
Morning.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.067
Sausage sandwich? Bacon.
Yep.

32:27.133 --> 32:29.033
Mushrooms. Yep.
Come on then. Egg.

32:29.100 --> 32:33.867
We are hungover to fuck and the
only
thing that's gonna sort this out

32:33.933 --> 32:36.767
is a good old fucking fry-up.

32:38.067 --> 32:40.800
Fuck me, I must still be pissed.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.833
Rome, what are you doing to me?

32:42.900 --> 32:45.733
Everyone! Feeding time at the
zoo!

32:49.467 --> 32:52.967
How you feeling, Aaron?
Aaron was being sick last night.

32:53.033 --> 32:54.733
(retches)

32:54.800 --> 32:58.367
Everyone is ripping the piss out
of
us for how drunk I was last
night.

32:58.433 --> 33:00.567
Everyone knows
I can't handle me drink.

33:00.633 --> 33:04.567
So, Elettra and Gary, was there
any
fucky, fucky last night?

33:04.633 --> 33:06.067
No fucky, fucky.

33:06.133 --> 33:08.033
Result! No fucky, fucky.

33:08.100 --> 33:11.500
It looks like the cockblocking
plan
has worked after all.

33:11.567 --> 33:13.733
Eee, that's a shame, eh?

33:13.800 --> 33:16.900
Chloe is saying, "You didn't get
anything with Elettra".

33:16.967 --> 33:18.700
I got her in bed. I kissed her.

33:18.767 --> 33:21.633
You and Abbie had your fannies
out
and got nothing.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.333
Nathan! (babbles)

33:26.167 --> 33:30.367
We've got a day off and these
lazy
bastards want to sunbathe all
day.

33:30.433 --> 33:34.267
But I want to try
some proper Italian culture.

33:34.333 --> 33:37.000
I think we should go pizza
making.
I'll come!

33:37.067 --> 33:40.067
I may have just had
a massive, massive breakfast

33:40.133 --> 33:42.367
but I am pure starving
so I'm coming!

33:42.433 --> 33:45.100
Shall we get ready for pizza
making?
Yep. Howay.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.500
Bye!
Bye!

33:53.567 --> 33:56.267
I am fucking buzzing
for pizza making.

33:56.333 --> 33:59.467
You'd think I haven't been fed.
I'm fucking starving!

34:04.100 --> 34:07.667
Ooh, how lovely is this here.
This looks nice.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.567
I'm Giuseppe, nice to meet you.

34:10.632 --> 34:15.067
We get to the pizza-making place
and
it is everything I imagined and
more.

34:15.132 --> 34:18.567
There's even a pizza maker
called...
Giuseppe?

34:21.067 --> 34:22.867
I want to make a big cock.

34:22.933 --> 34:26.867
I've come up with this amazing
idea
to make a cock-shaped pizza.

34:26.933 --> 34:29.000
Cos I've not had cock
in a long time.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.733
(groans) It's so ugly!

34:30.800 --> 34:33.132
Feel like I'm stroking
an old man's cock.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.500
It's time to cook the cock.

34:35.567 --> 34:38.500
(all) Cook the cock. Cook the
cock.
Cook the cock.

34:38.567 --> 34:42.400
The chef tells us that the cock
only needs to be in for one
minute.

34:42.467 --> 34:45.667
Which is a lot longer than most
of the lads I've slept with.

34:45.733 --> 34:48.833
Oh, my God! Look at the balls!

34:48.900 --> 34:50.600
I get the pizza out the oven.

34:50.667 --> 34:54.467
I've never seen a cock
look so tasty. Get in my mouth.

34:56.500 --> 35:00.433
Eating cock pizza reminds me
of another certain bell end.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.833
Gary can't think
that he's got it all.

35:02.900 --> 35:06.000
He flirts with you
and then moves onto Elettra.

35:06.067 --> 35:10.100
I'd love to see what he's like
when Elettra's not here.

35:10.167 --> 35:11.900
She's not here forever, is she?

35:11.967 --> 35:14.800
No, he'll go back to you.
Try to flirt with me again.

35:14.867 --> 35:17.933
If Gary thinks he can graft
Elettra
then come back to me,

35:18.000 --> 35:19.800
he's got another thing coming.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.467
And it is a shame
cos I was starting to like him.

35:22.533 --> 35:24.900
Gary has treated girls
like shit in the past.

35:24.967 --> 35:26.933
That's why I want to get him
back.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.733
It's Operation Cockblock Gary
round two.

35:31.167 --> 35:32.300
(burps)

35:39.633 --> 35:40.633
Yes!

35:40.700 --> 35:43.000
So how many points is that?
One, Nathan.

35:43.067 --> 35:44.767
Hey!

35:44.833 --> 35:47.133
Whoa! How was it?
It was really good.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.567
We made pizza
in the shape of a cock.

35:49.633 --> 35:52.033
Gary, it was long and skinny
like yours.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.867
Mine's fat. Nathan? Back us up.

35:53.933 --> 35:55.967
He's got a fat cock.
Yeah!

35:56.033 --> 35:59.467
We're in Italy, we're in Rome
and everybody's in such a good
mood.

35:59.533 --> 36:00.900
Let's go and get smashed.

36:00.967 --> 36:04.000
Shall we get ready for tonight
then?
Yeah! Come on.

36:04.067 --> 36:06.167
Round three! Aaron, Aaron!

36:06.233 --> 36:08.367
Oh!
(laughs)

36:17.833 --> 36:19.567
We are all ready to hit the
clubs.

36:19.633 --> 36:22.967
This is my chance to carry on
the graft with Elettra

36:23.033 --> 36:25.500
and show Chloe and Abbie
that I'm no pushover.

36:25.567 --> 36:27.967
I've got a reputation
to keep a hold of here.

36:28.033 --> 36:30.267
Just wanna say
let's have a good night.

36:41.567 --> 36:45.067
We get to the club and wow,
it's fucking beautiful in here.

36:45.133 --> 36:47.233
Don't see clubs
like this in Newcastle.

37:04.433 --> 37:06.867
Operation Cockblock Gary
is about to begin.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.933
We need to do it
with military precision.

37:17.833 --> 37:21.233
With Chloe and Sophie helping
us,
the plan is to make sure

37:21.300 --> 37:24.767
that Gary and Elettra definitely
don't share a bed tonight.

37:28.133 --> 37:31.333
Every time I look over,
I see them plotting little
ideas.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.667
This isn't the first time the
lasses

37:33.733 --> 37:37.300
have tried to get one over on
me.
Bring it on.

37:46.233 --> 37:48.333
Gary is giving it the big one.

37:48.400 --> 37:52.167
These two need to be split up.
This is getting so fierce.

37:55.100 --> 37:58.300
Chloe's being an attention
seeker
trying to cockblock Gaz.

37:58.367 --> 38:00.600
Why do you care?
You just look stupid.

38:08.067 --> 38:11.367
I've come up with a new plan
to cockblock Gary,

38:11.433 --> 38:14.867
to make Elettra think
that she was his second choice.

38:14.933 --> 38:16.800
Now that is genius.

38:25.633 --> 38:28.967
Abbie's been talking to Elettra
for far too long.

38:29.033 --> 38:31.767
Let's just throw
a cat among the pigeons.

38:31.833 --> 38:35.867
I'm gonna mess with all three
girls.
What would they do if I pulled
Abbie?

38:43.233 --> 38:45.967
Did I hear
what I thought I just heard?

38:56.400 --> 38:59.033
I know some of us
are playing games at the minute.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.933
But since Scott left
I've started to fancy Gary

39:02.000 --> 39:04.300
but I don't want anything
serious.

39:15.233 --> 39:17.767
Tonight has been pure wicked.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.933
Get me home. The game is still
on.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.100
Mwahahahaha!

39:26.233 --> 39:29.867
Yous, no kebab
but we've got pasta bolognaise.

39:29.933 --> 39:32.933
We can't grab a kebab
like we do back in Newcastle,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.033
so we have got to eat
the good old Italian pasta.

39:38.367 --> 39:39.533
Oh, shit.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.833
Ew.

39:43.867 --> 39:46.567
(Nathan) Who wants to play
Would You Rather?

39:46.633 --> 39:50.900
It's been a full night of games,
so let's play another.

39:50.967 --> 39:53.533
Gaz. Abbie or Elettra?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.867
(all) Oh!

39:55.933 --> 39:58.800
If I am going to pull Abbie,
I'm not gonna say Elettra.

39:58.867 --> 40:00.233
I need this plan to work.

40:00.300 --> 40:04.967
She's never gonna put out so...
It'd probably be Abbie.

40:05.033 --> 40:06.533
All right, Gary, we'll see.

40:06.600 --> 40:11.400
Gary, would you rather
sleep with Elettra...

40:12.667 --> 40:15.533
...or have a threesome
with Chloe and Abbie?

40:15.600 --> 40:18.233
This game is meant to be called
Would You Rather.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.300
Not Would Gary Rather.

40:20.367 --> 40:23.967
I like threesomes, but I don't
know.
You don't, you fucking radge?!

40:24.033 --> 40:25.800
Gary, you cheeky little bugger.

40:25.867 --> 40:29.700
You should be privileged to
sleep
with me. I've got techniques.

40:29.767 --> 40:32.700
You're missing out on this,
bitch!

40:36.400 --> 40:37.867
He's missing out on what?

40:37.933 --> 40:41.967
Abbie, would you rather shag Gaz
or have Scott back?

40:42.033 --> 40:43.100
That's a good one.

40:43.167 --> 40:47.033
There is no way in hell that I
would
ever go back there with Scotty.

40:47.100 --> 40:50.667
So I'm gonna have to say Gary. I
just hope it doesn't go to his
head.

40:50.733 --> 40:52.567
I'm would have to say Gary.

40:52.633 --> 40:54.767
Abbie's just chose me over
Scott.

40:54.833 --> 40:57.967
It's time to wrap this game up
before she changes her mind.

40:58.033 --> 41:00.900
Everyone, it's been a pleasure.
I'm going to bed.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.733
There's not enough room!

41:07.800 --> 41:11.300
I can't believe that tomorrow
is our last day here in Rome.

41:11.367 --> 41:12.967
So it's off to bed for me.

41:15.067 --> 41:17.033
Cheeky bastard!

41:17.100 --> 41:19.767
Ah, well, why not? When in Rome!

41:19.833 --> 41:22.800
Oh, my God! What is that?

41:23.833 --> 41:25.733
I may have come out of one,

41:25.800 --> 41:29.633
but I never wanna see
the insides of a vagina again.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.800
I'm scarred for life.

41:31.867 --> 41:34.533
Nathan.
Nathan, are you OK?

41:34.600 --> 41:38.100
I have had such a good night
and I don't want it to stop,

41:38.167 --> 41:41.833
so I'm off to get
another bottle of wine with
Chloe.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.133
Hey.
You've got my T-shirt on.

41:45.200 --> 41:49.167
Right, this was in my case.
You put it in here.

41:49.233 --> 41:51.033
Ow!
(laughs)

41:51.100 --> 41:53.533
I seen Abbie and Gary
flirting in the club,

41:53.600 --> 41:57.400
but they're in the bedroom
alone.
That means one thing... necking
on!

41:59.467 --> 42:03.067
(they shout)
You were necking on!

42:03.133 --> 42:08.033
Part of my plan
was not for Elettra to walk in

42:08.100 --> 42:10.200
while I'm necking on with Abbie.

42:11.067 --> 42:15.367
My relationship with Gary
was like a coffee espresso
Italian.

42:15.433 --> 42:16.733
Short but intense.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.900
Do you wanna try the bed?

42:20.967 --> 42:23.200
She's actually getting into bed.

42:25.500 --> 42:26.833
Can I have a kiss?

42:29.533 --> 42:32.867
We're necking on. The plan's
worked!

42:35.333 --> 42:38.233
I'm gonna tease him.
I'm gonna leave him high and
dry.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.333
Night!

42:46.000 --> 42:49.633
After all of that tonight,
I've cockblocked myself from
Elettra

42:49.700 --> 42:53.733
and Abbie is being
a little dick tease. I give up!

42:53.800 --> 42:55.867
Oh, good.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.333
Let's fucking have it!

43:08.333 --> 43:10.633
You're an attention-seeking
twat.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.400
Me and Nathan have always
been close in this house

43:13.467 --> 43:16.567
and now it's totally changed.
I feel like I've got no-one.

43:18.333 --> 43:20.800
Everyone is on a fucking whitie.

43:24.133 --> 43:28.733
If I'm sleeping in the same bed
as
Gary, I'm wearing my best
nightie.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.567
Me and Abbie start kissing
and then intensely start
kissing.

43:32.633 --> 43:35.200
Me and Marnie are in this double
bed
to get it on.

44:05.900 --> 44:06.100
.
