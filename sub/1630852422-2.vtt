WEBVTT

00:05.480 --> 00:08.840
The famous Mrs Sweeney. There's
the girl I'm going to marry.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.680
Everything is about sex.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.240
That's Margaret.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.600
Canapes and cock.
Is there anything else?

00:14.600 --> 00:15.880
Well, hopefully a dessert.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.200
I do like it,
and I'm extremely good at it.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.480
Captain Ian Campbell.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.640
I liked him. I liked his castle.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.960
Shipwreck full of jewels.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.920
I inherited it all from
a distant, distant cousin.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.200
Ian always get what he
bloody wants.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.880
Be my Duchess. Yes?

00:30.880 --> 00:32.320
Then yes.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.760
Divorce him. Best thing I ever did.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.720
Perhaps if I didn't love my son

00:36.720 --> 00:40.520
so much I would deprive you
of your gloating triumph. You win.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.600
It's been one of
the greatest privileges of my life

00:43.600 --> 00:45.120
to restore Inveraray Castle.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.680
Pay the b-bills.
It's what you're for.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.520
Every morning I wonder which
Ian I'm going to wake up to.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.520
An enduring legacy
for my husband the Duke of Argyll.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.240
What happens to me when you die?
The home that I've built.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.960
My son will be duke,
and he's very fond of his mother.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.800
Don't push her in
the lake or anything.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.160
Of course I won't. Promise.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.400
No peeking. It's a surprise.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.600
I'm not peeking.
Turn right. You are peeking.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.040
I can feel the eyelashes moving.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.720
All right, a little further.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.800
Oh, you're getting there.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.240
Stop...stop.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.400
Ready? Look.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.280
A cannon ball?

01:29.280 --> 01:31.360
A Spanish Armada cannon ball.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.800
Four centuries that's been buried
under the seabed,

01:34.800 --> 01:36.720
and now it's your paper weight.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.040
We're getting there.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.920
All my treasure will be somewhere
safe.

01:44.920 --> 01:48.000
Probably two decks down.Mm?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.600
I'm in the right place.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.600
Didn't I tell you do it?

01:52.600 --> 01:55.280
Didn't I promise you you would be
the one to do it?

01:59.600 --> 02:02.040
Father?

02:02.040 --> 02:03.600
Christ, I'd forgotten, sorry.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.480
Ahem.
Yep, got to get you back to school.

02:08.480 --> 02:11.240
Margaret,
you remember Mrs MacPherson?

02:11.240 --> 02:12.600
Yes, of course.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.920
I've asked her to do some
secretarial work for you,

02:14.920 --> 02:17.600
she's excellent,
nothing gets by her.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.080
Her husband died.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.640
I promised him I'd look after her.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.360
Well, I could certainly use
the help.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.960
Marvellous. Come along first-born.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.840
My apologies.
Bit of a surprise for you.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.600
No, not at all.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.960
Such good news. A great family's
fortune is soon to be restored.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.640
Wonderful for the duke.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.480
Wonderful for us both,
Mrs MacPherson.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.840
Will you come and wave me off?

02:57.840 --> 03:00.240
Of course I will.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.080
Then we'll discuss my duties.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.440
And please, call me Yvonne.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.600
Goodbye, Ian.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.840
Good morning.
Morning.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.200
Thank you.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.280
The car is being packed.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.960
We'll need to leave in half
an hour.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.400
Thank you, Yvonne.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.960
What is it?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.280
I don't know.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.360
Oh. It's a crank.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.520
It's Louise's handwriting.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.280
You're not to brood on it.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.520
It belongs in the fire.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.160
Not a word about this.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.880
What on earth do you take me for?

06:12.600 --> 06:15.720
Are you telling me you actually
believe this?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.040
It's your handwriting.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.280
I write hundreds of letters.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.280
I've never written this.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.520
You spend an awful lot
of time in Paris.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.280
Everyone spends
a lot of time in Paris.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.120
I've never stayed at
L'Hotel St Mariette.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.160
I've never even heard of it.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.760
I wish I had been unfaithful,

06:34.760 --> 06:37.000
it would've given me some happy
memories of our marriage.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.200
HE SHOUTS: Are the boys my boys?

06:41.200 --> 06:44.800
I swear on the lives
of my sons who I would die

06:44.800 --> 06:49.480
for that you are their father.
You don't deserve them,

06:49.480 --> 06:54.920
but you are their father,
you piece of absolute shit.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.280
You're brooding.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.520
Why would someone send me
that letter?

07:29.280 --> 07:31.600
Because people are very strange.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.360
You should see some of
the things that I get sent.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.200
Don't think about it
because that's what these peculiar,

07:39.200 --> 07:42.720
nasty little people want.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.080
Oh...

07:45.080 --> 07:46.840
Of course the boys are yours.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.320
Of course they are.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.800
Don't get along with their mother
but I can't imagine for a second

07:52.800 --> 07:55.560
that she'd do something like that.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.480
She's far too boring.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.080
Don't leave me tonight.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.040
Stay by my side.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.600
Of course.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.840
It's your daughter's birthday.
It'll be fun.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.840
Papa.
Jeanne. Darling girl.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.320
Happy birthday, Jeanne darling.
You look wonderful.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.920
Margaret.
Well? Let's go get a drink.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.400
Oh, good idea.
I'm spitting feathers.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.600
Oh, dear, have you lost Ian,
darling?

09:17.600 --> 09:21.120
He's over there
with, er, wife number one.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.280
Yes, of course.

09:27.280 --> 09:30.080
Thank you Maureen, darling.
Enjoy the party.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.280
I will.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.720
Jeanne, go back to your friends.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.320
Oh, but mummy,
this is much more interesting.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.840
Jeanne!

10:12.320 --> 10:14.680
I paid for this party.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.680
I know.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.800
The least you could do is not
humiliate me.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.840
This isn't about humiliating
you, Margaret.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.960
This is about doing what Ian wants

10:26.960 --> 10:30.560
because not doing what
Ian wants is a scene.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.880
You must have realised that by now.
A scene.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.360
Right here in public.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.160
I don't want that.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.040
Do you know,

10:40.040 --> 10:43.840
I think you can't bear it that I've
succeeded where you've failed?

10:45.200 --> 10:47.400
You think I want him back?

10:51.480 --> 10:53.840
On the first night of our honeymoon,

10:53.840 --> 10:57.720
Ian took me to a brothel because,
according to him,

10:57.720 --> 10:59.880
I had a lot to learn.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.040
I was 17.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.000
Ian took everything I had,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.960
and then he moved on to Oui Oui
and took everything she had,

11:09.960 --> 11:13.320
and when the money runs out,
because it will,

11:13.320 --> 11:15.960
the campaign to remove you will
begin in earnest,

11:15.960 --> 11:19.680
and if you're not very careful,
you, too, will be left with nothing.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.760
You and Oui Oui may be snivelling
little girls,

11:22.760 --> 11:24.360
but I'm not,

11:24.360 --> 11:27.800
and I don't need or want
your advice.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.680
He just left and you didn't try
and stop him?

11:45.680 --> 11:47.120
I did look for you.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.480
Well, not very hard.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.600
He took my car, Yvonne,
my car and my driver.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.000
I have a car.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.040
Well, it's a Volvo, no frills,
covered in dog hair.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.360
Dog hair? For a duchess?
I'll arrange a taxi.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.120
No, I love dogs. And you are?

12:03.120 --> 12:06.400
Peter Combe.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
Shall we?

12:08.400 --> 12:10.440
Yes, we shall.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.520
Thank you, Yvonne. Goodnight Janet.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.120
I hate this bathroom.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.840
Why would anyone sane want to watch
themselves as they strain

13:06.840 --> 13:10.080
for stool from every
possible angle?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.760
There are other bathrooms
for you to strain in.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.280
I hate those, too.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.960
In fact, I hate this whole house.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.120
Well, I love it.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.960
You didn't mind passing out in there
last night.

13:23.960 --> 13:27.080
Ow, Margaret. That's a low blow.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.800
You do like to kick
a man when he's down, don't you?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.480
If I liked kicking a man when he was

13:33.480 --> 13:36.280
down I would've stamped you to
pieces on that bath-mat.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.600
You took my car, Ian.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.560
My car and my chauffeur.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.040
Look at you, you're fine.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.320
You're all hung over and vulnerable
and delicious.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.160
Just don't treat me like your
other wives.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.920
Oh, God. Don't tell me you've been
speaking to Janet.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.360
No.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.880
You should give it up.
Give what up?

14:00.880 --> 14:05.040
This house. This cold,
sterile hole of a house.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.480
Don't be ridiculous.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.400
We'd have more money.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.280
You're always complaining
about money.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.280
Give it up, you won't have to
complain, will you?

14:12.280 --> 14:14.320
Get that shipwreck off
the sea floor,

14:14.320 --> 14:16.440
and we can have as many houses as
we want.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.280
You don't think I can do it, do you?

14:20.280 --> 14:22.880
You think I'm going to cock it up.
Can't raise a shipwreck.

14:22.880 --> 14:26.360
Can't fight a war without getting
captured. Can't father his own sons.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.240
Oh, for God's sake Ian, I told you
to ignore that bloody letter,

14:29.240 --> 14:30.720
and who is it who's always telling

14:30.720 --> 14:32.840
you you can achieve whatever you
want? Me.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.840
Yes. You do a lot of telling.
You're like Nanny.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.720
The last thing I am is your nanny.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.400
If I didn't think you could raise
that hulk,

14:40.400 --> 14:42.160
I wouldn't have invested
so much money in it.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.320
Here we go again. Money.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.920
I'm being a horrible bastard.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.720
Yes, you are.
Why do you put up with me?

14:52.720 --> 14:54.800
No idea.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.480
I'm going to take you out
to dinner tonight,

14:57.480 --> 15:00.400
make up for being
such an incorrigible,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.200
selfish prick last night.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.840
Have a think about
the house, though.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.880
No. Yes.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.320
No. Just think about it.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.400
That's new since I last saw you.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.080
Pain?

15:44.080 --> 15:45.120
No.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.680
It's just a twinge.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.880
Numbness? Pins and needles?

15:50.880 --> 15:53.960
No. Insomnia?
Blurred vision? Headaches?

15:55.440 --> 15:59.640
No, no, er, sometimes.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.560
Anything else?

16:05.480 --> 16:07.200
I want to have a baby.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.680
You were lucky to have two children
all things considered,

16:13.680 --> 16:15.360
and that was before your fall.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.960
But my accident was years ago.

16:17.960 --> 16:21.760
If you manage to carry the child to
term, and that is a big if,

16:21.760 --> 16:24.600
I am not certain you'd survive
the labour.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.520
There's been so many advances
in medicine.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.200
It could kill you.

16:40.440 --> 16:45.400
DOORBELL RINGS

16:40.440 --> 16:45.400
No, leave it.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.640
Diana, darling.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.400
You're answering your own door.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.640
Have the ravens left the tower?

16:51.640 --> 16:53.000
Where's Il Duce?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.280
Oh, he's at the House of Lords all
day, something about...

16:55.280 --> 16:56.600
Oh, I don't know and I don't care.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.240
Go away.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.200
Now I'm swearing you
to absolute secrecy, Diana.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.960
All right, fine, yes.
What's the urgency?

17:09.280 --> 17:10.560
Well?

17:12.120 --> 17:14.080
I need you to buy me a baby boy.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.640
What?

17:16.640 --> 17:19.240
A newborn baby boy.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.240
I'll pay. I'll pay very well.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.600
You're married to a Pole.
You must have lots of contacts,

17:24.600 --> 17:26.760
and there must be some poor girl
somewhere who wants

17:26.760 --> 17:28.680
to give her baby
the best of everything,

17:28.680 --> 17:30.160
you know, a wonderful life.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.240
The baby does need to grow up tall
like Ian, though,

17:32.240 --> 17:34.760
so it's probably best that you know
the parents.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.600
Oh, Jesus.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.840
You're serious.

17:46.320 --> 17:51.560
Margaret, either you're having a
nervous breakdown, or I am.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.520
Oh, Diana.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.680
No, it's too awful.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.280
No, it's too shocking.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.440
Ian's sons aren't his.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.240
They're illegitimate.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.880
Both of them. Heir and spare.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.400
How do you know?

18:15.400 --> 18:18.240
Ian got a letter, anonymous.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.360
They say they've got proof.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.560
Well, that's just
standard extortion.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.040
No, they don't want money.

18:26.040 --> 18:30.280
They want to right a great wrong,
set matters straight.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.880
They're some other man's sons,

18:34.880 --> 18:38.920
passed off as sons by bloody
Oui Oui this entire time.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.400
Oui Oui?

18:40.400 --> 18:42.160
She doesn't seem the type.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.400
Oh, she's the type.
She's completely vindictive.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.040
So, Ian needs an heir because he
can't possibly leave anything

18:48.040 --> 18:49.360
to them now, can he?

18:49.360 --> 18:51.400
Have you met the
British aristocracy?

18:51.400 --> 18:54.680
It's rammed with bastard Earls
and by-blow Barons.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.480
Everyone turns a blind eye.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.800
I've thought it all through.
I start to pad my waist,

18:59.800 --> 19:01.680
let people whisper about it.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.120
Start the rumours,

19:03.120 --> 19:05.800
and then I go to
a clinic in Switzerland,

19:05.800 --> 19:09.840
and then you bring me
a beautiful baby boy,

19:09.840 --> 19:12.800
and I give you a lot of money.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.880
I thought you were my friend.
I am, and as your friend

19:15.880 --> 19:18.800
I'm telling you,
just don't get involved.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.760
Ian's sons are nothing to do
with you.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.200
Well, Inveraray wouldn't exist if it
wasn't for me and Daddy.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.680
It would be a ruin and those boys
would have nothing to inherit,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.240
so yes, it has everything to do
with me.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.120
Margaret, go on holiday before you
get yourself in trouble.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.640
Diana, I swore you to secrecy

19:35.640 --> 19:38.760
so if you tell anyone I'll know that
you can't keep a promise.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.760
A long holiday. Somewhere sunny.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.440
Oh, hello, darling.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.040
You said you'd take me out
for dinner.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.280
Do you know, the House sat late?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.280
Yes, it did.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.760
But you weren't there.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.840
Oh, I'm sorry. I was at the club.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.640
No.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.400
You weren't there, either.

21:01.400 --> 21:06.080
Oh. Your legion of spies,
duh, duh, duh, duh.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.400
Drunk. You were drunk last night
and you're drunk now.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.480
Fish-face is being
a little nag tonight.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.880
You reek of other women.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.480
Do I?You've been with some other
woman, then you come back to me in

21:16.480 --> 21:19.560
this state? Oh, my God, this
relentless bourgeois whine.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.960
It's so fucking boring!

21:21.960 --> 21:23.920
OFF-SCREEN: Your grace.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.640
Oh, dear.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.160
Now look what you've made me do.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.480
I've gone and woken the servants.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.080
Why are you being like this?

21:31.080 --> 21:34.680
I had such a lovely day and then
you've gone and spoilt it.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.280
I'm going to sleep at the club,

21:38.280 --> 21:41.320
and tomorrow morning we go back
to Inveraray first train.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.240
I won't be.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.040
You'll do what I tell you to do,
and when I tell you to do it.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.960
You must be confusing me
with one of your other wives.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.160
Oh, I'm so glad you were free.

22:09.160 --> 22:12.120
Darling, for you, I'm always free.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.760
So, what's the menu tonight?
Drinking or dancing?

22:17.240 --> 22:19.800
Both.
Right answer.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.040
# I got the news early this morning

22:30.040 --> 22:32.600
# My baby was leaving town

22:32.600 --> 22:35.880
# I searched high, low, narrow and
wide

22:35.880 --> 22:37.960
# The girl just can't be found

22:37.960 --> 22:39.560
# I gotta keep rolling... #

22:39.560 --> 22:41.480
Two martinis please.

22:41.480 --> 22:46.720
# ..I gotta keep rolling along

22:49.320 --> 22:53.800
# Until I find my baby

22:53.800 --> 22:57.400
# I gotta keep rolling along. #

22:59.320 --> 23:04.400
# I guess that I will

23:04.400 --> 23:09.720
# Never get over you

23:09.720 --> 23:14.880
# I guess that I will

23:14.880 --> 23:19.920
# Never get over you

23:19.920 --> 23:24.640
# I know I broke your heart

23:24.640 --> 23:30.400
# And now you've broke mine

23:30.400 --> 23:35.520
# You were so right for me, girl

23:35.520 --> 23:39.800
# I was so blind. #

24:08.080 --> 24:10.760
I loved your mother so much.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.800
You've got me, Daddy.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.040
You've always got me.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.400
You shouldn't have let Yvonne go
without discussing it with me first.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.960
We can't afford her, Ian.
We have to save money.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.880
Besides, I didn't have enough work
for her.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.760
She can't just stand around doing
nothing. Well, why not? You do.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.920
Look, I got her another job,

24:40.920 --> 24:42.640
and I'm giving her lunch
to make up for it.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.520
Ooh. Lunch with you. What a treat.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.680
That's terrifying.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.080
You think I want to do this?

24:52.080 --> 24:55.200
Do you think I want to debase myself
advertising Argyll socks?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.400
You'll have me selling

24:56.400 --> 24:59.080
surgical trusses with the family
crest on it next.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.360
If it pays well, why not?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.200
Or you could give up this house?

25:03.200 --> 25:06.120
Or you could give up your
treasure hunt?

25:06.120 --> 25:08.160
We're ready, Your Grace.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.680
Oh. You done?

25:10.680 --> 25:13.160
Oh, it's just like being there.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.640
So, where do you want me?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.520
I'm out for dinner tonight.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.080
Smile.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.160
Super.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.000
I was very sorry
to hear about your mother.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.920
Thank you.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.080
And are you enjoying your new job?

25:41.120 --> 25:44.640
They're a very generous employer.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.880
I'm very glad.
It was difficult to let you go,

25:47.880 --> 25:51.960
I hope you understand that.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.280
Yvonne, can I ask you?

25:54.280 --> 25:57.080
You've known Ian longer than I have,
and he and your husband

25:57.080 --> 25:59.240
were such good friends,

25:59.240 --> 26:02.840
has he always been so impossible?

26:02.840 --> 26:04.360
The drinking.

26:05.440 --> 26:09.240
He can be so changeable, I can
barely keep track of his moods.

26:09.240 --> 26:13.320
Well, the Duke has
a lot on his mind at the moment,

26:13.320 --> 26:15.840
although I don't see how you can
tell that he's impossible.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.160
You're never with him.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.200
I...

26:20.200 --> 26:21.600
..beg your pardon?

26:21.600 --> 26:24.760
You keep talking about how much you
love Inveraray.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.520
I do. It's my home.

26:26.520 --> 26:30.800
But you're always here,
going about with men,

26:30.800 --> 26:34.760
men half your age.
If you spent more time with Ian,

26:34.760 --> 26:37.880
supporting him as a proper wife
should then maybe he wouldn't

26:37.880 --> 26:39.200
be so impossible.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.720
Oh, I see. So, it's my fault.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.880
I don't think you try hard enough.
No, I try.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.200
Do you?

26:45.200 --> 26:48.880
And as for that advertisement,
how could you?

26:48.880 --> 26:51.560
Debasing and humiliating
a man like that,

26:51.560 --> 26:56.600
your own husband forced to shill
for mass produced socks.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.560
Yvonne, I've invited you here as a
friend,

26:59.560 --> 27:01.400
and you choose to speak to me
like this.

27:01.400 --> 27:06.240
You invited me to lunch because you
want me to agree with you.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.720
Perhaps because you thought
I'd drop some hints,

27:08.720 --> 27:11.240
some gossip about poor Margaret,

27:11.240 --> 27:12.720
and how she suffers with the Duke,

27:12.720 --> 27:15.360
what a saint that woman is.
Well, you're no saint.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.680
I feel sorry for Ian.
He deserves better.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.720
Well...

27:19.720 --> 27:21.720
..Ian always thought you were
terrible at your job.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.680
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
have lasted two months.

27:27.600 --> 27:31.520
If you're going to tell lies,
do try and make them plausible.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.720
Do you know, Yvonne,
I think you've just remembered

27:42.720 --> 27:44.200
a very important engagement.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.400
Do you know, I think you're right.
I have.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.320
Make sure Ian packs everything he
needs for Scotland.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.160
He needs a wife.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.440
That's it. We're shutting it down.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.320
The exploration is over,
Your Grace.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.760
Come on, please. I beg you,
we're nearly there.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.920
Don't stop now.
I'm working out with the admiralty,

28:11.920 --> 28:15.680
you can stay in the boat.
You can...you can get back to it.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.480
We're so close.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.160
It's over, Your Grace.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.560
Dr John Petro for the Duke.
He is expecting me.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.720
I've failed.

29:44.520 --> 29:47.200
Ian?

29:47.200 --> 29:49.680
What is it?
I've failed.

29:49.680 --> 29:54.640
No. No, of course you haven't.
We tried everything.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.440
We both did.
It's just it's not possible.

29:59.320 --> 30:02.680
I wanted it for my boys.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.800
They're my boys.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.560
They're mine.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.920
Of course they are.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.320
Your Grace? Dr Petro.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.560
Dear me, old boy.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.480
You are a mess.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.960
He's got a raging temperature
and he's not making any sense.

30:32.960 --> 30:38.280
I beg your pardon, Your Grace,
but I need privacy.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.480
I'll be just outside, darling.

31:23.160 --> 31:27.200
I saw that you prescribed
amphetamines for the Duke.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.200
Yes, to boost his system.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.200
I would've thought that
an iron tablet,

31:33.200 --> 31:35.960
cod liver oil would've been
better treatment.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.880
Not amphetamines.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.120
His behaviour...

31:44.120 --> 31:46.080
..can be very volatile.

31:48.920 --> 31:53.240
Have you given my husband
this boost before?

31:53.240 --> 31:55.800
I'm here to treat your
husband's pneumonia.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.400
What sort of doctor are you?

32:05.200 --> 32:07.160
The Duke's.

32:15.640 --> 32:19.400
Which one of your lovers are you
seeing this time?

32:19.400 --> 32:21.160
Is it Peter Combe?

32:22.480 --> 32:26.600
God's sake. Peter escorts me.

32:26.600 --> 32:31.320
He's got so many girlfriends,
I'd have to book him in advance.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.720
I've got a meeting with the bank,

32:33.720 --> 32:36.560
and if I thought it would help
OUR situation, I'd ride the manager,

32:36.560 --> 32:38.680
and all the clerks like the
Cheltenham winners.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.400
No, you like it like this.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.440
You're glad that shipwreck's buried
under the mud.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.480
Am I really? Mm.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.080
It means you can still control me,
prancing around

32:48.080 --> 32:52.640
calling yourself a Duchess with
my balls in your fucking handbag.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.840
Well, it's not as if they take up
much room.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.560
Oh, dear.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.760
Now you've lost your place.

33:08.680 --> 33:11.280
You take too many of those.
They're not doing you any good.

33:11.280 --> 33:15.240
They stop me from shooting myself
in the face.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.160
How many men have you got?

33:21.160 --> 33:25.440
Oh, at least 80. Probably more.
How about you?

33:25.440 --> 33:27.360
How many women have you got?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.400
Of course, I could just shoot YOU in
the face.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.080
You could...

33:45.080 --> 33:48.600
..but then you'd be hanged
for murder and I'd win,

33:48.600 --> 33:51.960
and think how much you'd hate that.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.720
You see, this is why we're a match.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.680
Oui Oui and Janet would've burst
into tears,

33:58.680 --> 34:00.520
but not you.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.200
You're a little streetfighter.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.840
Lipstick.

34:08.400 --> 34:12.400
Now that you've mentioned her,

34:12.400 --> 34:15.160
have you decided what
you're going to do

34:15.160 --> 34:18.240
about Oui Oui and the letter?

34:19.680 --> 34:22.040
Well...

34:22.040 --> 34:27.200
..after taking professional
advice, I've decided to do nothing.

34:27.200 --> 34:29.000
Professional advice?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.880
I went to Scotland Yard,
spoke to a Detective.

34:31.880 --> 34:34.520
He said this sort
of thing happens all the time.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.720
Plus they found nothing at
L'Hotel St Mariette.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.280
They said do nothing.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.040
They'll trip themselves up
in the end.

34:40.040 --> 34:43.800
Well, I'm glad that you've
spoken to someone,

34:43.800 --> 34:45.720
though you never mentioned it to me.

34:45.720 --> 34:48.400
Well, why, would I? They're not your
children.

34:52.240 --> 34:54.840
Are you going to talk
to your father about money?

34:56.560 --> 34:59.280
Ian, I don't want to ask him for
money while he's still grieving.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.720
I do love you, you know?

35:20.720 --> 35:22.120
In spite of it all.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.800
I do love you.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.200
And don't worry about your balls.
I'll keep them safe.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.880
Don't tell me you didn't know, dear.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.000
No, of course I did.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.240
They just wanted
to keep it, er, secret,

36:01.240 --> 36:07.080
you know, private,
being so soon after Mummy,

36:07.080 --> 36:10.080
and there's photographers everywhere
I go, so.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.200
You didn't want to steal
the bride's light.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.800
You are so selfless.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.520
Utterly angelic.

36:22.120 --> 36:27.120
The couple departed immediately for
a honeymoon in Barbados. Adorable.

36:30.520 --> 36:34.120
Your new stepmother's
younger than you.

36:34.120 --> 36:37.320
Your daddy is a sly old dog.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.960
You're sure you're OK?

36:51.960 --> 36:54.480
I'll be fine.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.440
I feel silly telephoning you.
I don't know what I was thinking.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.080
No, it's OK.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.480
I was just worried about you,
that's all.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.880
Oh, God, here he is.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.000
Oh, I look a fright.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.720
Margaret?Mm?

37:17.720 --> 37:20.960
Why don't you just tell him
another night, mm?

37:20.960 --> 37:26.280
We could just have a quiet little
dinner, just you and me.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.480
No, darling.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.720
No.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.760
Sorry for ruining your evening.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.120
No...No you didn't.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.200
No plans, as per.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.000
Er, call me.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.080
No.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.280
Please.

41:05.280 --> 41:08.320
B... B...

41:08.320 --> 41:11.680
Be nice.

41:11.680 --> 41:15.600
I know how to b-behave.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.160
Salutations and congratulations,
George.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.280
Thank you. Hello, hello, hello.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.320
Jane. Lovely to see you. Hello.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.200
Enchanted to meet you at last.
Oh, thank you.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.360
My darling daughter.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.440
Come in and sit down. Thank you.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.480
So, how was the journey up?

41:34.480 --> 41:38.240
Oh! Oh, very long. Long. Yes.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.240
Oh, it's nice to be here.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.400
Well, let's have
a spot of restorative lunch,

41:44.400 --> 41:48.320
and then I'll take Jane for
a tour of the garden.

41:52.320 --> 41:57.000
Gosh, it's, erm...

41:57.000 --> 41:58.920
It's beautiful.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.240
Of course I should've told you

42:03.240 --> 42:07.400
but I was swept off my feet.
I've been so lonely,

42:07.400 --> 42:09.360
you know, since mother.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.240
I would've kept you company.

42:18.680 --> 42:21.040
Ian was drunk at lunch.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.880
We were all having champagne.

42:22.880 --> 42:25.200
He was drunk when we arrived,

42:25.200 --> 42:27.600
and I see the way he drinks
in the club.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.400
Everybody drinks, Daddy.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.480
He drinks for oblivion,
and you know it.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.200
Daddy?

42:51.200 --> 42:55.200
Please don't ask me
to bail Ian out again.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.960
I'll not throw good money after bad.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.560
I see.

43:03.760 --> 43:06.400
You understand about the money?

43:09.040 --> 43:11.880
Of course.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.640
And about Jane?

43:13.640 --> 43:16.080
I just want you to be happy.

43:16.080 --> 43:19.480
I am. So very happy.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.400
Did you talk to him?

43:39.600 --> 43:40.960
Yes.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.840
And?

43:51.800 --> 43:53.600
No.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.000
There's no more money.

44:05.920 --> 44:10.120
How long am I going to get
the silent treatment for?

44:13.040 --> 44:15.480
Pathetic.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.080
It's especially sickening

44:17.080 --> 44:19.800
to watch you be completely charming
to Jane and then foul to me.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.200
Mm. Well it's easy to be lovely
to Jane.

44:22.200 --> 44:24.240
She's delicious and sexy.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.880
Your old man's going to need Spanish
Fly to keep up with her.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.480
She's wasted on him.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.640
SHE YELPS

44:33.640 --> 44:36.160
LOUD BANGING

44:36.160 --> 44:39.400
What are you for?

44:39.400 --> 44:41.400
What are you for?

44:41.400 --> 44:43.560
What is the point of you?

44:43.560 --> 44:45.400
What are you for?

44:45.400 --> 44:46.960
I'm coming in.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.240
I'm-I'm coming in right now.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.680
Your Grace.

44:53.680 --> 44:55.280
MARGARET GASPS FOR BREATH

44:55.280 --> 44:57.680
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

45:23.800 --> 45:25.840
Do you need a doctor?

45:25.840 --> 45:30.800
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

45:54.760 --> 45:56.520
Dr Petro.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.480
How did you find me?

46:01.760 --> 46:04.680
Well, I'm sure the police would be
very interested in a doctor whose

46:04.680 --> 46:07.200
consulting rooms is
this sordid hole,

46:07.200 --> 46:09.400
and whose patients queue up outside.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.800
What can I do for you?

46:11.800 --> 46:15.080
You are going to stop giving my
husband amphetamines.

46:15.080 --> 46:16.640
You'll cease all contact with him.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.560
His health is no longer
your concern.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.800
Do we understand one another?

46:29.360 --> 46:30.880
Good.

46:43.600 --> 46:47.920
Your Grace, any comment on the Duke
taking a suite at Claridge's?

46:47.920 --> 46:50.400
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
My husband's in Scotland.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.920
If he was in London,
he'd be with me.

46:51.920 --> 46:53.640
No, he's he in Claridge's.

46:53.640 --> 46:57.600
We've been told your marriage
is over. Any comment?

46:57.600 --> 47:00.320
Come on,
you must know something, Duchess?

47:03.840 --> 47:05.800
Duchess? Duchess, a quick word?

47:05.800 --> 47:08.520
Oh, hello, here we go.
Duchess?

47:15.440 --> 47:19.000
Oh, of course it would be you.
Where is he?

47:21.800 --> 47:24.880
He doesn't want to see you,
Your Grace.

47:26.360 --> 47:27.960
What have you told him?

47:27.960 --> 47:32.320
I haven't told him anything.
I haven't told ANYONE anything.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.920
I want to see my husband.

47:33.920 --> 47:38.120
Please, don't make a scene.
He doesn't want to see you.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.720
I wouldn't believe
a word she's saying. She's a liar.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.000
That's why I don't want her working
for me any more. Duchess?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.880
She's a deeply troubled woman.
Duchess?

48:00.880 --> 48:02.240
You try and help people,

48:02.240 --> 48:04.560
and they just throw it back in
your face.

48:06.960 --> 48:08.960
Why's he leaving you, Your Grace?

48:18.920 --> 48:20.560
Where is he?

48:56.040 --> 49:01.880
TELEPHONE RINGS

49:01.880 --> 49:03.800
Hello?

49:03.800 --> 49:08.680
SHAKY BREATHING ON TELEPHONE

49:08.680 --> 49:10.440
Come back, please.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.000
Ian?

49:16.200 --> 49:17.280
Please come.

49:19.760 --> 49:23.240
I...I can't bear it, please come.

49:23.240 --> 49:25.320
Where are you?

49:49.200 --> 49:51.400
Oh, Ian.

50:00.760 --> 50:07.480
IAN RETCHES OFF-SCREEN

51:08.920 --> 51:11.600
Bonne nuit.Merci.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.200
I don't know why I went
to Claridge's.

51:55.280 --> 51:59.520
I don't know why I say
and I do the things I do. I don't.

52:02.720 --> 52:06.400
You frighten me sometimes, Ian,

52:06.400 --> 52:08.520
and you hurt me.

52:14.160 --> 52:16.160
You wouldn't give me money.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.960
I kept thinking that you were lying,

52:23.960 --> 52:26.720
and you were going behind my back
and you were lying.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.400
I think we can make it work
between us,

52:41.400 --> 52:45.280
I really do.

52:45.280 --> 52:48.920
But we have to be kinder,

52:48.920 --> 52:51.640
stop doing terrible things
to each other.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.560
What terrible things have you done?

53:02.160 --> 53:04.360
Nothing, just...

53:04.360 --> 53:06.280
..being in London too much.

53:08.200 --> 53:11.360
It's not quite the same as
humiliating me in public, but still.

53:11.360 --> 53:12.800
I'm so sorry.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.640
Yes, you should be.

53:14.640 --> 53:16.120
I'm sorry.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.600
The pills and the drinking have got
to stop, Ian.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.880
Yes.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.640
For good. Yes.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.720
We'll be all right.

55:34.600 --> 55:39.040
DOG BARKS OFF-SCREEN

55:39.040 --> 55:40.400
Piss off.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.960
DOG WHIMPERS
