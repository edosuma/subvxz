00:07.108 --> 00:12.146
(train sounds)

00:25.593 --> 00:30.631
(singing "Ave Maria")

01:07.735 --> 01:09.470
(gasps)

01:24.385 --> 01:29.690
(slow guitar music)

01:29.690 --> 01:32.660
* Butterflies, tinted
eyes falling down

01:32.660 --> 01:37.198
* To the sea, at high tide

01:37.198 --> 01:40.501
* Bringing me back to the place

01:40.501 --> 01:43.171
* I can feel

01:44.538 --> 01:45.906
* Love

01:45.906 --> 01:49.543
* She bring me back home

01:57.318 --> 01:59.920
* Coffee cup,
belly up to the bar

01:59.920 --> 02:02.590
* We walk in pairs

02:02.590 --> 02:05.559
* Scattered by numbers

02:05.559 --> 02:09.463
* Dare us to stare at the signs

02:10.598 --> 02:13.601
* Written everywhere

02:14.468 --> 02:19.173
* The end of time is here

02:20.508 --> 02:22.576
* Beware

02:24.812 --> 02:27.615
* If you believe

02:28.482 --> 02:31.552
* There's a heaven

02:36.624 --> 02:38.926
* Somewhere between

02:40.361 --> 02:43.197
* You and me,

02:43.197 --> 02:47.635
* You and me, well I will

02:47.635 --> 02:51.171
* Try to believe

02:52.273 --> 02:54.575
* There's a heaven

02:58.479 --> 03:01.615
* But the angel gone blind

03:01.615 --> 03:04.485
* In the sweet summer snow

03:04.485 --> 03:07.655
* I hardly remember

03:09.523 --> 03:12.526
* What I used to know

03:14.995 --> 03:18.232
* What I used to kow

03:20.901 --> 03:23.404
* What I used to

03:25.573 --> 03:27.575
* Know

03:32.646 --> 03:36.950
* Rattling across open plains

03:37.985 --> 03:42.356
* Truth look on with disdain

03:42.356 --> 03:46.327
* At the fear

03:46.327 --> 03:48.662
* No one will claim

03:48.662 --> 03:51.732
* At the end of the day

03:51.732 --> 03:54.402
* Desire

03:54.402 --> 03:55.736
- Hey, where's Jerrod?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.371
- In the back.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.506
- Tell him to put
his food order in.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.617
Hey Chris.

04:09.617 --> 04:12.286
- Dylan, you look worse than me.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.655
- Can't get a hold
of these hours.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.957
- You got the rap group,
Killer Kane on the sixth floor

04:16.957 --> 04:19.860
already causing
trouble, one guest VIP,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.763
Amber Strong, adult film star.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.964
- She's VIP?

04:23.964 --> 04:25.533
- Her money says she is.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.568
- What's the count?

04:27.568 --> 04:28.669
- Negative 16.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.871
- Are you fucking kidding me?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.573
Hey, put your food order in.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.442
What's the average
no shows lately?

04:34.442 --> 04:36.510
- Holding around 5%.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.547
You got 600 rooms, 30
guests, you should be fine.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.315
- Fucking reservations assholes.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.317
They sell 616 rooms
'cause they're not here

04:43.317 --> 04:45.586
when the hotel is filled up
and you gotta walk a guest.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.454
- Preaching to the
choir, brother.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.822
I worked night shift
for five years.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.391
You got it.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.761
(sighs)

04:57.765 --> 05:02.703
(piano music)

05:37.605 --> 05:39.940
- Ah, yes.
(phone rings)

05:39.940 --> 05:42.576
Here you go.
(phone rings)

05:44.412 --> 05:45.145
- Did you put your food in?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.447
- I will in a bit.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.615
Who's the bellman?

05:47.615 --> 05:48.849
- Rico.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.951
(phone rings)

05:59.527 --> 06:02.730
(phone rings)

06:06.800 --> 06:09.036
- I wonder if that was
Linda's first time tonight?

06:10.538 --> 06:11.539
Rico!

06:11.539 --> 06:13.741
- Jerrod! How you feeling, sir?

06:13.741 --> 06:14.808
- Hot!

06:14.808 --> 06:16.644
- How bout you, Dyl?

06:16.644 --> 06:20.448
- (sighs) Feel like I still
can't get used to these hours.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.449
- You try what I said?

06:21.449 --> 06:22.616
- Yeah, yeah.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.519
I got home at seven, and I
didn't go to sleep until 1 pm.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.554
- How long did you sleep?

06:26.554 --> 06:27.855
- I slept til nine.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.424
- Well, you should
be well rested, then.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.593
- Nah, I don't think
it works for me, man.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.862
Tonight as soon as I get
home, I'm going to sleep.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.630
- It's your call, but
you been on nights

06:36.630 --> 06:38.031
what, three months?

06:38.031 --> 06:40.701
I been on it seven years.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.035
- C'mon Jerrod, call it in.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.472
- What is your deal
with the food order?

06:44.472 --> 06:45.506
- The kitchen's
been giving me shit

06:45.506 --> 06:47.107
because we're making
'em stay late.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.642
- Tell 'em to go
fuck themselves.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.543
- Yeah, then you
would go home and

06:49.543 --> 06:50.644
we'd have nothing to eat.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.779
C'mon, go.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.080
Where's Marco?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.815
- I think a guest called
him up to his room.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.584
- So he's gonna
leave the front desk?

06:56.584 --> 06:58.452
- It's Marco.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.923
- Lisa, can I get
a burger, medium?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.492
Thank you.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.628
(elevator dings)

07:09.530 --> 07:11.832
- Ah, let me guess, assholes
starting early tonight?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.602
- Mr. Capso in 305 says his
air conditioning is too loud.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.869
- So let's transfer him.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.170
- He's in a one bedroom suite.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.473
All of them are booked.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.642
- (sighs) I'll call Dylan.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.049
Hey Dyl, we need you back.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.684
Thank you.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.560
- Can I help you?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.193
- Are you the manager?

07:40.193 --> 07:41.094
- Yes, I am.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.262
- I need a new friggin room.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.631
- And why is that?

07:43.631 --> 07:44.832
- Air conditioning's
too freaking loud.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.567
- I'll send Pablo up
to take a look at it.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.268
- Your boy Marco was already up.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.670
- Marco's not the repairman.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.039
- Just give me a
new friggin room.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.608
- Sir, there are no other
one bedroom suites available.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.243
I could give you a room
with a king size bed.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.611
- I'll take a two bedroom suite.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.846
- None available.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.681
- (sighs) You know what, fine.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.551
I want a refund; I'm
going to another hotel.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.652
- Okay, you can
speak to Brad, he's

08:04.652 --> 08:05.953
the reservations
manager, he's on

08:05.953 --> 08:08.556
Monday through
Friday, 9 am to 5 pm.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.957
- Fuck you.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.625
- I'll send a bellman up
to help you with your bags.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.660
- Fuck all you.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.994
I don't need help.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.531
- Bring up his account.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.832
I'm praying, truly.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.235
- Score. He rented
one last night.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.136
- What's it called?

08:23.136 --> 08:24.204
- Balls in Play.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.272
- Sir?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.074
Remember to bring down
the adult DVD you rented,

08:27.074 --> 08:28.742
I think it was
called Balls in Play?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.544
You gotta bring that down, sir.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.282
- Love the fact that we hand
deliver all of our DVDs.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
- It's a little outdated,
but it's a touch of class

08:36.884 --> 08:38.552
from the Century Grand.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.754
- Check this guy out.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.993
- Sir, can I help you?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.995
- Yeah, lost something.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.663
- What'd you lose?

08:49.663 --> 08:50.798
- Lost my dick.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.566
(laughs)

08:52.566 --> 08:54.735
- How're you gonna find it?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.269
- Find it up my
girlfriend's ass.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.806
- Okay sir, thank you
for letting us know.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.107
- Sure.

09:05.713 --> 09:06.747
- Seemed like a nice guy.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.048
- Yeah.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.721
- Hey sweetie.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.988
- Hey Linda, how are things?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.990
- Eh, they're slow.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.225
- What you got?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.628
- Euro. Swedish dude.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.237
Thanks sweetie.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.205
You have a good one.
(phone rings)

09:32.205 --> 09:35.008
- You too.
(phone rings)

09:49.222 --> 09:51.591
- Let me guess: yen?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.728
- No, euros, why?

09:55.663 --> 09:56.730
- It's usually yen, right?

09:56.730 --> 09:58.899
- Those Japanese businessmen
love their hookers.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.402
- Hey, hey. Linda's a
high-priced call girl.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.337
(phone rings)
- I forgot.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.806
That's how hotel
management wants us

10:05.806 --> 10:08.742
to refer to her as we
turn the other cheek.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.178
- I always ask her
how her night's going.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.380
She always says the
same thing: slow.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.948
No matter how many
times she goes

10:14.948 --> 10:16.216
up and down that elevator
to service some guy,

10:16.216 --> 10:17.751
she says it's slow.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.053
I'm dying to find out what
a busy night is for her.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.690
- Dylan, you didn't
say hi to me.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.957
- I saw you banging the phones.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.794
- They call all
at the same time.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.128
Hey, Jerrod.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.832
(phone rings)

10:33.934 --> 10:35.703
- You sure you don't
want to date her?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.238
- Positive.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.973
- I love how you
get all serious.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.710
You should give her a shot.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.144
- She has crazy eyes.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.813
- She has pretty eyes.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.014
- Crazy eyes.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.315
Trust me.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.786
(sighs)

11:08.035 --> 11:10.137
- You tired?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.905
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.676
- Linda wants to
exchange more money.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.047
- I'm kidding.
Fucking with you, bro.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.215
Go back to sleep.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.460
- I don't know, I
just feel better.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.795
You know?

11:34.795 --> 11:37.197
Maybe not on the
inside, but just knowing

11:37.197 --> 11:40.467
that I made a choice, you know?

11:40.467 --> 11:43.170
Knowing that you're not a
victim, you're not weak,

11:43.170 --> 11:45.072
you know, something like that.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.707
- Hola, SeÃ±orita,
how are you tonight?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.879
Mr. Dylan, so good
to see you again.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.846
- Hi, Enrique.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.381
- Enjoy it.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.453
- You shot up again, didn't you?

12:01.755 --> 12:04.124
Dammit, Rachel, we're supposed
to be in this together.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.725
I just,

12:07.360 --> 12:09.963
We can do this, believe it.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.499
Together, please.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.037
Dammit, why won't
you believe it?

12:18.005 --> 12:18.906
Dammit, why?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.440
- Dylan!

12:20.440 --> 12:21.942
Dylan, we got a problem.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.744
- What is it?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.749
Holy shit.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.420
Ma'am?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.756
Ma'am, ma'am?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.425
What happened?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.795
Call 911, now!

12:41.795 --> 12:43.130
Jerrod!

12:44.564 --> 12:45.532
No no no, don't touch her.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.400
Don't touch her.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.338
Ma'am, did someone
do this to you?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.043
- My name is Holly.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.048
My boyfriend beat me up.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.018
- Where is he now?

13:06.486 --> 13:09.189
(Holly gasping)

13:10.457 --> 13:12.525
- [Holly] Room 618.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.828
- Okay, call Jeff security, go.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.231
Holly is there,

13:18.231 --> 13:20.200
is there anything we should,

13:20.200 --> 13:21.601
no wait, call Pablo.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.071
Okay no, just do
it, do it, do it.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.406
- [Jerrod] He just walked up.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.407
- Pablo, you have the gloves,

13:27.407 --> 13:29.042
the plastic gloves?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.143
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.145
Gimme 'em. C'mon, now!

13:34.081 --> 13:37.384
Holly, everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.121
- Oh, fuck.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.022
- Yeah.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.190
Get that guy out of the lobby.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.491
Shit's about to go
down, all right?

13:47.094 --> 13:48.896
Holly, okay, I'm here.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.965
It's okay.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.567
- [Jerrod] I called
him twice, no answer.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.905
- Candice, come here.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.407
Pablo, give a pair
of gloves to Candice.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.642
Please, Candice.
(Holly cries out)

14:02.642 --> 14:03.643
I'm going to have Candice
take you to the bathroom

14:03.643 --> 14:05.612
and get you cleaned up.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.314
Okay?

14:07.314 --> 14:11.618
(Holly sobs)

14:18.158 --> 14:19.526
Call him again.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.040
- [Rico] C'mon bro, get up.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.307
- [Man in lobby]
Hey, you're cute.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.342
- [Rico] Get up.
Go to your room.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.576
Can't sleep in the lobby.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.945
(Man mumbles)

14:37.945 --> 14:39.179
Go to your room.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.082
- Hey, Rico, chill.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.216
- Sorry, Dyl.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.119
- Security's still not here.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.520
- All right.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.323
Uh,

14:52.592 --> 14:55.528
Okay, 618, bring him
down, no violence,

14:55.528 --> 14:56.529
do not touch him.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.165
I mean it. Go.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.638
(elevator dings)

15:08.575 --> 15:13.613
(foreboding music)

16:03.430 --> 16:05.498
- You know how to get
to the China Club?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.202
- You're a guest here?

16:09.202 --> 16:10.270
- Yeah.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.738
- What room?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.573
- 642.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.044
- You go to 46th Street, make
a right, it's a half a block.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.645
- All right, thanks buddy.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.250
- Hey, you in charge here?

16:23.250 --> 16:25.618
- Yes, I'm Dylan Barrick,
I'm the overnight manager.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.586
- Did you call it in?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.221
- No, my operator Candice did.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.091
- Where's the girl?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.559
- She's in the
bathroom with Candice.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.495
This girl walks in the
lobby, and her face is

16:35.495 --> 16:37.064
a mask of blood.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.498
It turns out her
boyfriend beat her up.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.133
- Where's he?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.402
- Room 618, I got two of my
staff escorting her down.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.040
- How bad?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.408
- Oh, it's bad.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.177
Oh, hey Jeff, nice
of you to show up.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.678
- Ah man, we had
some shit going on.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.046
- Who's this?

16:53.046 --> 16:54.381
- This is our
security guard, Jeff.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.316
He wasn't here; he had
some shit going on.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.451
This girl,

16:58.451 --> 16:59.586
- Did you get a name?

16:59.586 --> 17:00.487
- Holly.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.756
- What is it?

17:04.924 --> 17:07.560
- Let's just say I'm not 100%
sure she's his girlfriend.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.596
- What do you think, call girl?

17:09.596 --> 17:10.563
- Well I was wearing
gloves, and I got

17:10.563 --> 17:12.432
my operator Candice
doing the same thing.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.634
(elevator dings)

17:17.069 --> 17:18.371
- Fuck you think
you're going, bro?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.638
- Jerrod, ease up.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.112
This is Jerrod Percy,
he's our front desk agent.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.146
This is Rico Taylor,
he's one of our bellmen.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.415
- Well, it's good
to see you, Jeff.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.250
Glad you took your fucking time.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.551
When we got up
there, he was packed

17:31.551 --> 17:33.220
and headed for the stairs.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.254
- Fuck you, man.

17:34.254 --> 17:34.754
I had shit to do.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.323
- Enough.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.666
- What's your name?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.067
- Davis Riley.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.537
- What happened?

17:51.338 --> 17:53.206
- We got in a fight.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.474
- [Candice] Dylan.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.590
- Cuff him.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.325
- Let's go.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.633
- Mr. Barrick.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.635
Mr. Barrick?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.237
- Yeah? Yeah?

18:24.237 --> 18:26.139
- We're gonna need to
get a statement from you.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.507
All right?

18:30.177 --> 18:31.278
- Okay.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.779
Yeah. Whatever it takes.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.486
I gotta go check that room.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.567
No!

19:15.188 --> 19:20.159
(mellow piano music)

20:21.421 --> 20:26.459
(train sounds)

20:33.766 --> 20:35.668
(phone rings)

20:37.837 --> 20:39.839
(phone rings)

20:41.708 --> 20:43.843
(phone rings)

20:48.047 --> 20:49.649
Hello?

20:53.353 --> 20:54.687
Okay.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.624
Yeah.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.633
- She says he took her money.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.567
- Shit.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.936
- What is wrong with you?

21:11.604 --> 21:12.772
- I was up all night.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.342
- Yeah, you're the
night shift manager.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.509
- It was a tough night, asshole.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.311
- Hey, don't you
talk that way to me.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.412
- Back the fuck off, Henry.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.780
- Guys.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.682
C'mon.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.353
- I don't know what
to tell you, Chris.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.854
Yeah, he might have
come to the desk,

21:27.854 --> 21:29.322
asked for the
safety deposit box,

21:29.322 --> 21:30.490
but he had a key.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.725
I mean, how do I know
whose money it is?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.596
- I'll tell her to
file a police report.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.964
- How much money
did she say he took?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.466
- Try four grand.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.634
- He had a key.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.102
- I can't believe I'm
here on my day off.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.971
I can't get away
from this place.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.373
When did all this happen?

21:46.373 --> 21:47.574
- 30 minutes ago.

21:47.574 --> 21:48.708
Right when I came
in to relieve Henry.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.510
The girl from last night--

21:50.510 --> 21:52.445
- Wait, Holly?

21:52.445 --> 21:53.546
Is she here?

21:53.546 --> 21:55.615
- She said she checked in
and deposited the money

21:55.615 --> 21:57.584
before she went upstairs.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.420
- Did the police find out
if she's a working girl?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.522
- Turns out she really
is his girlfriend.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.393
- Let's go talk to her.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.029
(groans)

22:10.830 --> 22:12.432
- Ma'am?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.467
We believe you're gonna have
to file a police report.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.070
- I can't do that.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.373
- Your boyfriend had a
key, you both checked in,

22:20.373 --> 22:22.509
he was able to
retrieve the money.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.513
- I just want my money back.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.648
- I'm sorry, but
we don't have it.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.050
- Please give it to me?

22:31.050 --> 22:33.119
- Sister, you need
to lower your voice.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.854
- Hey, back the fuck off, Henry.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.523
- Don't you yell at me.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.591
- I'm sorry, would you
give us a moment, please?

22:38.591 --> 22:39.926
Guys, come on.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.529
Don't ever pull that shit
in front of a customer.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.830
I don't care what you
two have between--

22:43.830 --> 22:45.898
- I'm sorry, Chris.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.504
- Help me.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.642
(mellow piano music)

22:55.642 --> 23:00.680
(intense music)

23:53.466 --> 23:58.505
(heavy bass thumping)

24:19.559 --> 24:20.493
- Yo, you lost, bro?

24:20.493 --> 24:21.594
- What's that?

24:21.594 --> 24:22.929
- Yo, give me your motherfucking
money, motherfucker.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.542
- Yo, fuck you man.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.943
- No, fuck you.

24:38.945 --> 24:43.983
(melancholy music)

25:04.704 --> 25:06.606
It's so great being
with you, Rachel.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.641
I love you so much.

25:31.163 --> 25:36.035
(train sounds)

25:44.043 --> 25:45.678
- Mr. Dylan.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.715
I have not seen you
around here for so long.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.116
How have you been?

25:50.116 --> 25:51.718
- I'm good, Enrique, good.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.587
- And how is your girl, eh?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.123
- We're not together anymore.

25:57.857 --> 25:58.991
- Oh.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.694
Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.631
But good to see you, seÃ±or.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.693
- So you are saying
he took her money?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.628
- She's saying he
gave her the money.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.730
- What do you
think about it all?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.099
- What happened?

26:40.099 --> 26:41.400
The guy's a piece of
shit, he got drunk

26:41.400 --> 26:42.902
and he beat up his girl.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.304
- So what are you doing here?

26:46.238 --> 26:49.275
- This girl Holly, you know,
I just feel bad for her.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.409
I want to see if
maybe there's a way

26:50.409 --> 26:51.410
I can help her out.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.780
- What happened to your hand?

26:53.780 --> 26:55.381
- Some guy tried to mug me.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.949
- How'd you do?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.785
- I kicked his ass.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.855
- So this girl, Holly,

27:02.855 --> 27:05.692
she'd have to come down
and fill out a report.

27:05.692 --> 27:06.959
- I figured as much.

27:06.959 --> 27:07.994
But I'm thinking maybe I can get

27:07.994 --> 27:09.696
her full name and her address?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.197
- For what reason?

27:12.364 --> 27:14.100
- You know man, I just
want to check up on her,

27:14.100 --> 27:15.668
make sure she's okay.

27:17.436 --> 27:18.705
- (clears throat)
Well we wouldn't

27:18.705 --> 27:20.372
have her address, just his.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.174
And wouldn't you have
the same information

27:22.174 --> 27:23.442
from when he checked
into your hotel?

27:23.442 --> 27:24.744
- Yeah, we might.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.378
- So just get it there.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.147
- Yeah, I'm here now.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.381
You know, I'm
thinking I might want

27:29.381 --> 27:31.784
to stay away from that
place for a day or two.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.387
- What are you gonna
do with his address?

27:35.387 --> 27:37.389
- Look man, I'm just
gonna check up on her.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.058
I feel a little
responsible, and I just want

27:39.058 --> 27:40.893
to make sure she's okay.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.274
- I have to go talk to
somebody down the hall.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.977
You know your way out?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.469
(knocking on door)

29:01.240 --> 29:03.209
- Yeah? Who're you?

29:03.209 --> 29:05.444
- You were at the Century
Grand the other night?

29:05.444 --> 29:06.445
- Yeah, so?

29:06.445 --> 29:08.247
- I'm looking for Holly.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.415
- Why's that?

29:09.415 --> 29:12.118
- I have something
that belongs to her.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.858
- Holly's gone.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.427
So what do you got for her?

29:23.562 --> 29:25.264
- Where'd she go?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.566
- She has some apartment
up on 34th Street.

29:27.566 --> 29:28.868
I don't know the address.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.069
You know, my guess
is she's back out

29:30.069 --> 29:32.905
on the street, but I
never know with her.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.907
What can I tell
you, she's on horse,

29:34.907 --> 29:36.809
she's a heroin addict.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.077
- Why'd you hit her?

29:38.945 --> 29:40.379
- Cause she wouldn't
listen to me.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.381
I told her to stop injecting
that shit into her veins.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.582
So I come in the other night--

29:43.582 --> 29:44.516
- Drunk off your ass.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.152
- Yeah, and, but she
was about to do it.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.086
So I stopped her.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.320
- By punching her in the face.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.922
- Yeah. I mean, what
do you want me to say,

29:49.922 --> 29:51.157
I'm a total dick.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.324
There's nothing
you're gonna say to me

29:52.324 --> 29:53.325
that's going to make
me feel any worse

29:53.325 --> 29:54.326
than I already do.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.829
I got huge problems, and
I really have trouble

29:56.829 --> 29:59.098
controlling myself,
especially when I get drunk.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.032
Understand?

30:00.032 --> 30:01.400
- No. No man.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.135
I don't understand how
a guy can beat the shit

30:03.135 --> 30:05.137
out of a woman like that.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.405
- Well, that's
'cause you're not me.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.439
And you don't fucking know me,

30:07.439 --> 30:09.008
so don't fucking judge me.

30:10.309 --> 30:14.280
So, what are you, hot
for Holly or something?

30:15.014 --> 30:16.182
- No.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.119
- Lookit, I took
her off the street.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.922
If she wants to go back on
the needle, fine, fuck her.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.858
She wants to hit rock bottom
again, that's her business.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.293
But if she comes back
here and she starts

30:27.293 --> 30:29.028
fucking lying to me again,
I'm gonna fucking kill her

30:29.028 --> 30:31.030
just to put her out
of her own misery.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.637
- You took her money.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.506
- Fuck you. That
was my money, bro.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.008
- I ain't your bro.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.277
- Lookit, I gave her
money, and I said

30:45.277 --> 30:47.413
she could keep it if
she stayed straight.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.048
- Well, I want to
give it back to her.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.582
- What, so she'll just
go buy drugs again?

30:50.582 --> 30:51.483
- Give me the money.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.318
- Fuck you.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.519
- I ain't playing, bub.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.888
- What'd you come up here to
shake me down or something?

30:55.888 --> 30:57.589
I'll put you in jail, you fuck.

30:58.524 --> 31:03.629
(piano music)

31:25.284 --> 31:26.585
- Hey.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.387
- What you need, man?

31:28.387 --> 31:29.621
- I'm looking for a tall girl,

31:30.556 --> 31:31.991
redhead, name's Holly?

31:34.060 --> 31:35.294
- You a cop?

31:35.294 --> 31:36.562
- No.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.464
- What are you, then?

31:39.598 --> 31:40.566
Her boyfriend?

31:41.400 --> 31:42.468
- No, man.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.671
- I get it.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.507
You trying to be a hero.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.611
You got a picture of Miss Holly?

31:53.512 --> 31:54.580
- I don't.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.150
- How was I supposed
to help you find her?

31:58.985 --> 32:01.287
- I was hoping you'd know her
by her name and description.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.056
- I don't.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.226
- Anywhere else you
can buy around here?

32:09.395 --> 32:10.963
- Where she live?

32:11.597 --> 32:12.431
- I'm not sure, exactly.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.600
Maybe 34th Street.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.203
- Shit, you on 34th Street now.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.206
Unless you talking
bout by the river.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.540
- I might be.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.411
- That's Tino
Henoya's area, bro.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.381
- I'll look him up.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.587
- We done?

32:39.658 --> 32:41.593
What else you need, bro?

32:42.394 --> 32:44.196
- Give me two bags.

32:50.736 --> 32:55.641
(piano music)

33:31.177 --> 33:33.079
- What you need?

33:33.079 --> 33:35.614
- I'm looking for this tall
redhead, her name's Holly.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.283
You know the girl
I'm talking about?

33:38.284 --> 33:39.618
- You a cop?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.555
Oh shit, long time, D.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.224
- Yeah.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.427
She left something at
the hotel I work at.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.429
- And you tracking her down?

33:51.197 --> 33:53.031
- It's important
that I find her.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.467
- You the one that beat her up?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.769
- No way, man, some shitbag
boyfriend did that to her.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.606
He also stole her money,
and I got it back.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.611
- You want to just give it
to me and I'll pass it on?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.580
- Tino, I gotta find her.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.286
- You still work
at the same place?

34:15.286 --> 34:17.489
- Century Grand,
it's 46th Street--

34:17.489 --> 34:19.525
- Yeah, I know where it's at.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.560
I'll tell Holly you
got her money, aight?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.495
- Just tell her I got something

34:23.495 --> 34:25.563
I want to give her, all right?

34:27.199 --> 34:29.101
- You want her to come
to the hotel to get it?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.237
- I doubt she's gonna
want to go back there.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.605
Look, how bout this, let me
give you my home address.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.110
Just tell her to
come here, all right?

34:45.751 --> 34:48.154
- So you at the same spot?

34:48.154 --> 34:49.455
- Yeah.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.492
- Yo, that chick Holly,

34:54.860 --> 34:56.362
you change her hair, her face,

34:56.362 --> 34:57.396
she looks just like--

34:57.396 --> 34:58.830
- Yeah.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.203
- Look, all I do is sell, man.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.106
People don't want to
buy, I don't force shit.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.476
I promise you, I
had nothing to do

35:10.476 --> 35:11.877
with what happened to Rachel.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.612
- Yeah, I know.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.251
- You still on that heavy stuff?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.789
- Off and on, you know,
I don't shoot up anymore.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.228
- Where you buying from?

35:29.228 --> 35:29.861
- Here and there, man.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.563
Don't worry bout it.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.332
- I do worry about it.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.701
Some of that street shit
is crazy, you heard?

35:35.701 --> 35:37.703
- Look man, could you just
pass this on to her, all right?

35:39.171 --> 35:40.606
- I got you.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.446
Fuck, let's drive around
the block or something, man.

35:48.647 --> 35:53.685
(piano music)

37:10.662 --> 37:11.663
What you need?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.599
- Give me one bag.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.837
- Hey, baby girl. How you doing?

37:19.971 --> 37:21.573
- I'm okay.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.010
- Some guy came around
here looking for you today.

37:26.512 --> 37:27.846
- Tell him to fuck off and die.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.316
Tell him to give me my money.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.551
- He did say he had
something for you.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.486
- Who? Davis?

37:35.020 --> 37:36.388
Not a chance.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.724
- Nah, this guy's
name was Dylan.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.693
He's the hotel manager
at the Central Grand.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.633
- Did you fall asleep again?

37:49.335 --> 37:50.602
- Uh, yeah.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.504
Yeah.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.506
I'm the boss, I get
to do what I want.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.641
- I know.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.642
I'm just wondering.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.577
- NIght manager gets to
make the rules, okay?

37:58.577 --> 37:59.678
As long as we get
through the night and

37:59.678 --> 38:01.713
the hotel's here in the
morning, I've done my job.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.816
- I heard that when Elan
that the night shift manager,

38:04.816 --> 38:07.419
he spent half his time at
the Kevin St. James bar.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.020
- Patrick used to talk
to his girl all night.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.255
Okay, what's up?

38:10.255 --> 38:12.891
- We're all out of rooms, and
this guy wants to check in.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.993
- Shit, we're at full capacity?

38:14.993 --> 38:17.062
- I told you that
20 minutes ago.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.000
- Yeah, I know, yeah,
I remember that.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.970
You caught me in the middle
of a sleep cycle or something.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.475
- All right, who's got rooms?

38:29.475 --> 38:31.410
- The Marriott Marquis.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.554
- I'm gonna be able to
sell to all the top people.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.724
It's just a matter of
convincing them on the upgrades.

38:47.493 --> 38:48.594
Hold on a minute, Jim.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.462
What the hell is taking so long?

38:50.462 --> 38:52.498
- Sir, unfortunately we
don't have any rooms left.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.500
- What?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.502
Jim, did you hear that?

38:56.502 --> 38:57.669
Are you serious?

38:57.669 --> 38:59.037
- Yes.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.907
- Well, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

39:02.808 --> 39:04.810
- We have to walk
you to another hotel.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.446
- Well this is fucking bullshit.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.415
This is,

39:09.415 --> 39:11.583
what the fuck does, what
does that even mean?

39:11.583 --> 39:13.919
We've arranged a room for
you at the Marriott Marquis.

39:13.919 --> 39:15.521
We'll pay for your
cab fare there.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.556
You get the same room
rate as you would here.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.124
Tomorrow night you're
guaranteed a room here,

39:19.124 --> 39:20.492
and it's free.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.627
It's actually a
really good deal.

39:21.627 --> 39:22.928
- Really?

39:22.928 --> 39:24.996
See, I don't see it that way.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.632
I'm here now,

39:27.699 --> 39:29.701
and my bags are here,

39:29.701 --> 39:31.437
and the company's paying
for the fucking room,

39:31.437 --> 39:32.538
so what do I care?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.943
Motherfuckers.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.552
- That's what you get for
checking in after 5 am, jackass.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.557
Did you hear Cesar's
back on nights tomorrow?

39:51.557 --> 39:53.592
- Yep, Rico told me.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.962
- Guess we can expect to see
more call girls and escorts.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.466
- I've never worked with
Cesar on nights before.

40:00.466 --> 40:04.470
- He has a deal with every
call girl in the city.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.606
Foreign businessman walks
in and says he wants action,

40:08.574 --> 40:10.776
Cesar hooks him up
with whatever he needs.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.043
And he gets a little bonus money

40:12.043 --> 40:14.079
from both the call
girl and the guest.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.582
The bastard's making
more money here

40:16.582 --> 40:18.950
than both of us put together.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.220
- Hear Scarlett Johansson's
checking in tomorrow night?

40:22.220 --> 40:23.989
- (scoffs) Yeah,
you mentioned it.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.224
So what's her name?

40:26.224 --> 40:28.994
It's like Greta Wanderking,
something ridiculous.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.763
- Thought they changed the names

40:31.763 --> 40:33.799
to throw off the
paparazzi as well?

40:33.799 --> 40:34.966
- Yeah, no, they
change the names

40:34.966 --> 40:36.735
every five months or so.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.537
She has reservations
at a bunch of hotels.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.540
- Hmm. Where's she staying?

40:41.540 --> 40:42.874
- She's staying here.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.610
Chris knows her manager.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.977
He said we'd give her
the star treatment.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.148
How much time we got left?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.150
- 57 minutes.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.052
Watching every one.

40:55.521 --> 40:56.522
- I'm gonna go downstairs.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.524
I don't really feel like
seeing Henry tonight.

40:58.524 --> 41:00.559
If he needs me,
tell him to call me.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.728
You can hold down the fort
for a little while, right?

41:02.728 --> 41:04.162
- Putting me in charge?

41:05.196 --> 41:07.633
Hell, all I've got to do
is make sure the hotel

41:07.633 --> 41:09.601
is still here in
the morning, right?

41:09.601 --> 41:11.202
- You listen.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.047
- Yeah.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.582
All right, wait.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.251
All right, cool.

41:26.251 --> 41:27.853
Um, yeah.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.254
No no no, that's
fine, that's fine.

41:29.254 --> 41:30.622
Let's do that.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.693
I don't know, we'll work on it.

41:34.693 --> 41:35.994
All right look,
I gotta go, okay?

41:35.994 --> 41:37.729
- Hey Phillip, what's up man?

41:37.729 --> 41:38.930
- Everything good?

41:38.930 --> 41:40.632
- Yeah Phil, you know,
I'm just working.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.601
- Yeah, I heard you're at the
Grand now man, that's great.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.535
Good for you.

41:43.535 --> 41:44.670
- I'm the overnight manager now.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.271
- What? Good for you.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.606
That's awesome.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.207
- I can't handle
the hours, though.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.809
- Ah, don't whine to
me about the hours.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.611
You think all I do
is jerk off all day?

41:52.611 --> 41:53.645
I wish I had time to do that.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.113
All I do is work.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.649
- Well, you got a lot more
energy than I do, Phil.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.618
(Phil laughs)

42:01.086 --> 42:02.854
You talked to Mom lately?

42:04.155 --> 42:05.190
- C'mon bruh, I thought
we were just going

42:05.190 --> 42:06.625
to have a nice dinner.

42:07.693 --> 42:09.127
- Jeez, I'm just
wondering, Phil.

42:12.063 --> 42:13.264
- Yeah.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.666
Yeah, I talk to her.

42:14.666 --> 42:15.867
- What's she been up to?

42:17.603 --> 42:19.070
- Same stuff.

42:23.842 --> 42:25.744
- Maybe I should
call her, you know?

42:27.679 --> 42:29.815
- Yeah, I don't know about that.

42:29.815 --> 42:31.016
- Why not?

42:31.016 --> 42:33.284
- Don't give me that
shit, you know why.

42:33.284 --> 42:34.953
- 'Cause my girlfriend hung
herself in my apartment?

42:34.953 --> 42:37.222
- Jesus fucking Christ Dyl,
what the hell is wrong with you?

42:37.222 --> 42:38.189
- I'm just asking if that's why

42:38.189 --> 42:39.658
she doesn't want to talk to me.

42:39.658 --> 42:40.626
- You really want
to go there, huh?

42:40.626 --> 42:41.359
- Go there.

42:41.359 --> 42:42.160
- Maybe it's because she thinks

42:42.160 --> 42:43.361
you still got problems.

42:43.361 --> 42:44.329
- And not talking to
me is the solution?

42:44.329 --> 42:46.297
- You wanna put the
cards on the table, huh?

42:47.666 --> 42:49.134
Are you still on the stuff?

42:49.134 --> 42:50.669
- No, no man, you know,

42:50.669 --> 42:52.337
yeah, no.

42:53.705 --> 42:54.673
- That's great.

42:54.673 --> 42:55.807
If that's true, that's great.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.175
- I still got
problems, though, Phil.

42:57.175 --> 42:59.277
You know, it's
dealing with the pain.

42:59.277 --> 43:00.378
- Are you clean or not?

43:01.613 --> 43:05.183
- Every once in a while I
still got problems and...

43:09.988 --> 43:12.023
- C'mon man, get
your life together.

43:12.824 --> 43:15.661
I gotta take this all
right, give me two minutes.

43:15.661 --> 43:16.795
- Yeah, man.

43:29.708 --> 43:30.575
- Hey.

43:30.575 --> 43:33.411
What the fuck do
you have to give me?

43:33.411 --> 43:34.612
- Holly?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.148
- Tino said you had
something for me?

43:38.650 --> 43:41.419
- Yeah I do, but it's inside
and I'm late for work.

43:41.419 --> 43:42.921
- What do you have?

43:44.155 --> 43:46.057
- Look, can we just meet
up tomorrow sometime?

43:48.193 --> 43:51.162
- Unless you're telling
me that your fucking hotel

43:51.162 --> 43:53.164
found my money, I don't
know what you have

43:53.164 --> 43:55.266
to give me that's worth a damn.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.403
- Look, do you have
a place to stay?

43:58.403 --> 44:00.706
- What are you doing?

44:00.706 --> 44:02.974
You want me to
stay at your place?

44:02.974 --> 44:04.375
Is that what you want?

44:04.375 --> 44:06.878
You want to bang me?

44:07.445 --> 44:11.182
- Look, let me at least give
you some cab fare, all right?

44:12.818 --> 44:14.786
- Why are you helping me now?

44:14.786 --> 44:17.723
You should have helped
me the other night.

44:19.691 --> 44:24.730
(piano music)

44:33.371 --> 44:34.372
- Hey.

44:34.372 --> 44:35.140
- Hey.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.207
- What you got?

44:36.207 --> 44:37.375
- Negative five.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.711
- Stomachable.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.282
- Heard you walked
a guy the other day.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.084
- Some business jerkoff
who couldn't give a shit

44:46.084 --> 44:47.285
that he was getting a free room,

44:47.285 --> 44:48.820
'cause his company
was paying for it.

44:50.822 --> 44:52.057
- So let's charge him.

44:52.057 --> 44:53.458
- Good idea.

44:57.763 --> 44:59.430
- Hey Marco, you
watching the front desk?

44:59.430 --> 45:02.333
- No sir, I am
off early tonight.

45:02.333 --> 45:03.969
Ciao, boss.

45:11.376 --> 45:12.477
- What's the deal, Cesar?

45:12.477 --> 45:14.279
- Hey Dyl, long time.

45:14.279 --> 45:17.282
We need to get this guy
in that two bedroom suite

45:17.282 --> 45:19.184
and it ain't ready.

45:19.184 --> 45:21.152
- We'll have it cleaned ASAP.

45:21.152 --> 45:23.154
- Nope, it's occupied.

45:25.523 --> 45:26.792
- Sir, could you
excuse us for a moment

45:26.792 --> 45:28.326
while we figure this out?

45:28.326 --> 45:30.028
- I hope this doesn't
take too long,

45:30.028 --> 45:32.097
'cause we been waiting
for 30 minutes.

45:32.097 --> 45:33.464
- We'll have you in there ASAP.

45:33.464 --> 45:35.100
Excuse us.

45:38.770 --> 45:39.805
What happened?

45:39.805 --> 45:41.039
- Henry.

45:41.039 --> 45:42.407
He put somebody else
in there this morning.

45:42.407 --> 45:44.109
- That prick fuck.

45:44.109 --> 45:46.344
I'm assuming all the other two
bedroom suites are occupied?

45:46.344 --> 45:48.814
- [Cesar] Yup.
- [Dylan] Shit.

45:50.882 --> 45:52.818
(Cesar laughs)

45:52.818 --> 45:54.986
- Some guy offered
me $500 if I'd

45:54.986 --> 45:57.322
show him my dick
earlier tonight.

45:57.322 --> 45:58.389
- Did you do it?

45:58.389 --> 45:59.424
- Nah.

45:59.424 --> 46:00.758
- Why not?

46:01.392 --> 46:03.028
- I got morals, bro.

46:07.432 --> 46:09.500
- All the one bedroom
suites are taken as well.

46:15.006 --> 46:17.408
- We gotta do a water leak.

46:19.077 --> 46:20.245
- Let's do it.

46:20.245 --> 46:21.312
- All right, call
Jeff from security,

46:21.312 --> 46:25.016
get Pablo up there as
well, and move her stuff to

46:25.016 --> 46:27.118
1221, it's the
king down the hall.

46:27.118 --> 46:28.854
- 1221, I'm on it.

46:30.221 --> 46:32.057
- Dylan.

46:32.057 --> 46:33.424
- You're late.

46:34.325 --> 46:36.461
- (sighs) So what,
it ain't busy.

46:37.428 --> 46:39.397
- That douchebag Henry gave
away a two bedroom suite

46:39.397 --> 46:41.366
and now the guy who
reserved it wants in.

46:42.533 --> 46:44.402
- Whaddya gonna do?

46:44.402 --> 46:46.537
- I got Cesar up there
now with Pablo and Jeff.

46:46.537 --> 46:49.240
They're gonna move her stuff
to a king down the hall.

46:50.876 --> 46:53.578
- What are you gonna do
when the lady gets back?

46:53.578 --> 46:55.146
- We do a water leak.

46:56.047 --> 46:56.848
- What's that?

46:56.848 --> 46:58.016
- You'll see.

46:58.016 --> 46:59.250
Put your food order in.

46:59.250 --> 47:00.919
- Already did.

47:03.554 --> 47:04.822
How you feeling, Dyl?

47:05.556 --> 47:07.258
- Fine, why?

47:07.926 --> 47:09.861
- You just been off the
past couple of days.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.162
- I'm tired.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.998
I just can't get
used to these hours.

47:14.199 --> 47:15.233
- Okay.

47:16.902 --> 47:20.038
It's gonna be fun to have
Cesar on tonight, huh?

47:20.038 --> 47:21.940
I can't wait to see what
shit he's gonna pull.

47:21.940 --> 47:24.109
- Yeah, he better
take it easy, okay?

47:24.109 --> 47:25.376
This whole place
has been on edge

47:25.376 --> 47:28.246
ever since that thing
went down with Holly.

47:28.246 --> 47:29.614
- Holly.

47:31.349 --> 47:32.583
That was her name?

47:34.920 --> 47:36.221
- Yeah.

47:36.221 --> 47:37.555
- Hmm.

47:38.456 --> 47:39.891
How did you know that?

47:41.226 --> 47:43.028
- She told us,
don't you remember?

47:46.531 --> 47:48.133
- I can help you over here.

47:48.133 --> 47:49.534
- Could you call
me a cab, please?

47:49.534 --> 47:50.902
- Yes.

47:54.906 --> 47:56.641
Hi, I need a cab to the Grand.

47:56.641 --> 47:58.309
Yes, thank you.

48:04.515 --> 48:05.483
- Hey.

48:05.483 --> 48:07.152
- Hey, hot stuff.

48:07.152 --> 48:08.419
How are things?

48:08.419 --> 48:10.321
- Same as always. You?

48:10.321 --> 48:12.057
- Eh. Slow tonight.

48:13.024 --> 48:14.092
- Yen?

48:14.092 --> 48:15.326
- I think so.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.495
- You got a family, Linda?

48:17.495 --> 48:19.097
- I do.

48:19.097 --> 48:21.432
Have a little girl,
nine years old.

48:24.035 --> 48:26.071
Why do you think I'm doing this?

48:26.071 --> 48:27.705
- Where's her father at?

48:27.705 --> 48:30.541
- Well he's out working,
making lots of money,

48:30.541 --> 48:32.177
and not giving a shit.

48:32.177 --> 48:32.944
- Sucks.

48:32.944 --> 48:34.479
- Yeah, I know.

48:34.479 --> 48:37.548
But, I am so glad that
Cesar's back on nights

48:37.548 --> 48:40.485
because Rico don't do
shit for my business.

48:40.485 --> 48:42.487
- Some guy asked Cesar to
show him his dick tonight.

48:42.487 --> 48:44.022
- For free?

48:44.022 --> 48:45.556
- No, he said he'd
give him $500.

48:45.556 --> 48:46.657
Cesar said no.

48:46.657 --> 48:48.059
- Really?

48:48.059 --> 48:49.494
Well maybe Cesar's
got a little problem.

48:49.494 --> 48:50.628
(both laugh)

48:50.628 --> 48:52.964
- My pants would have been
down on the word dollars.

48:52.964 --> 48:57.168
Show me your dick and I'll
give you 500, bang, pay up.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.075
- Have a good night, Dyl.

49:04.075 --> 49:05.710
- You take care, Linda.

49:11.382 --> 49:12.583
- Ma'am?

49:12.583 --> 49:14.585
- Are you the fucker
who authorized somebody

49:14.585 --> 49:17.288
to go into my room and
touch my personal things?

49:17.288 --> 49:18.556
- Yes.

49:18.556 --> 49:20.458
- I'm going to fucking ruin you.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.093
You violated me.

49:22.093 --> 49:24.295
You violated my
personal property.

49:24.295 --> 49:26.097
- Okay, no one
violated anything,

49:26.097 --> 49:27.732
it was all supervised
by two staff members

49:27.732 --> 49:29.467
and a security guard, okay?

49:30.335 --> 49:32.437
- My hands are
fucking shaking here.

49:32.437 --> 49:34.772
They touched my clothes,
they touched my toothbrush,

49:34.772 --> 49:37.608
they touched my underwear,
my fucking underwear!

49:37.608 --> 49:39.577
- Okay ma'am, ma'am, you're
gonna have to lower your voice.

49:39.577 --> 49:41.479
- Oh fuck you, you asshole.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.749
My company is gonna
sue this fucking joint.

49:44.749 --> 49:47.085
- Look, how long are
you staying here?

49:47.085 --> 49:49.754
- What are you going to
give me a fucking free room?

49:49.754 --> 49:53.424
I don't give a shit,
because nothing you can do

49:53.424 --> 49:54.759
can save you from the fact that

49:54.759 --> 49:56.661
you raped my stuff.

50:03.434 --> 50:05.770
- Did you really want
all your stuff destroyed?

50:05.770 --> 50:07.105
- What?

50:07.105 --> 50:08.406
- You probably have
10 to 15 minutes

50:08.406 --> 50:10.108
before everything was gone.

50:10.108 --> 50:11.276
- What are you talking about?

50:11.276 --> 50:12.477
- Why do you think
we moved your stuff?

50:12.477 --> 50:13.611
What do you think
this is all about?

50:13.611 --> 50:14.779
- Because your
operator said that

50:14.779 --> 50:16.447
you double-booked my room.

50:16.447 --> 50:17.815
- Well, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

50:17.815 --> 50:19.717
The computer doesn't
even allow us to do that.

50:19.717 --> 50:21.419
We moved your stuff
because a pipe burst

50:21.419 --> 50:23.121
and there was a water leak.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.756
So for what it's worth,
we'd like to give you

50:25.756 --> 50:27.525
a complimentary
room for tonight.

50:30.461 --> 50:32.497
- Well, I'd appreciate that.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.567
- Go up to your room and
enjoy your nice dry bed.

50:37.268 --> 50:39.470
I'll have a complimentary
bottle of wine

50:39.470 --> 50:40.571
sent up to you.

50:42.807 --> 50:44.509
- Thank you.

50:56.321 --> 50:58.323
- That was fucking brilliant.

50:58.323 --> 50:59.724
- God damn, man.

51:02.260 --> 51:05.130
I almost lost it, I swear
to god I almost lost it.

51:05.130 --> 51:06.797
- Yeah, but you kept
it together, man.

51:06.797 --> 51:08.633
Water leak? Shit.

51:09.700 --> 51:11.536
- Patrick created it.

51:11.536 --> 51:13.638
- Patrick's running
the Royalty now, right?

51:13.638 --> 51:15.106
- Yeah, yeah.

51:15.873 --> 51:17.708
Best manager in the
history of this hotel.

51:19.844 --> 51:20.745
- You know, people
were saying that about

51:20.745 --> 51:22.480
you for a while there, Dyl.

51:23.581 --> 51:24.849
- They were saying it?

51:24.849 --> 51:26.317
What, before the night shift?

51:27.485 --> 51:28.519
- Before the night shift.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.623
God damn, that bitch
got me all wound up.

51:32.623 --> 51:34.792
Standing there
screaming in my face.

51:34.792 --> 51:37.662
I'm gonna fucking knock
Henry's teeth out tomorrow.

51:37.662 --> 51:39.530
- Fuck him, okay?

51:40.498 --> 51:41.832
Don't let him get
to you like this.

51:41.832 --> 51:42.733
- No, no, no.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.135
He's a piece of shit, okay?

51:44.135 --> 51:45.836
His stupidity, it
causes this woman,

51:45.836 --> 51:47.372
he double books a
room and now she's

51:47.372 --> 51:48.706
screaming in my face, okay?

51:50.341 --> 51:51.409
We moved her underwear.

51:51.409 --> 51:53.244
Like anybody wants to touch
her fucking underwear.

51:53.244 --> 51:54.245
God dammit!

51:54.245 --> 51:55.280
Now I'm fucking wound up.

51:55.280 --> 51:56.814
My hands are shaking.

51:56.814 --> 51:58.649
- Jesus dude, you
need to calm down.

51:58.649 --> 52:00.318
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

52:00.318 --> 52:02.920
I'm sorry, I'm just all
wound up right now, okay?

52:02.920 --> 52:04.355
I need to get outside,

52:05.290 --> 52:06.591
you want some coffee, dude?

52:06.591 --> 52:07.625
Can I get you coffee?

52:07.625 --> 52:09.227
I'm gonna get some.

52:09.227 --> 52:10.595
- I'm good, bro.

52:10.595 --> 52:12.530
I'm good, I'm good.

52:17.868 --> 52:19.337
Wow.

53:11.556 --> 53:13.758
(horn honking)

53:13.758 --> 53:15.893
(tires squealing)

53:35.980 --> 53:38.549
- Dude, what the fuck happened?

53:39.350 --> 53:40.551
- I got jumped.

53:40.551 --> 53:41.852
- Fuck bro, how?

53:43.254 --> 53:44.389
- What time is it?

53:44.389 --> 53:45.356
- It's 4:30.

53:47.592 --> 53:50.895
- I'm gonna go lay down
in the back for a bit.

53:52.297 --> 53:54.231
How bad do I look?

53:55.266 --> 53:57.735
- I mean, you'll be all right.

53:58.603 --> 53:59.537
How big was the guy?

53:59.537 --> 54:00.671
- Big.

54:01.972 --> 54:03.574
- Unprovoked?

54:04.542 --> 54:06.677
- He yelled something
and I yelled back.

54:08.279 --> 54:10.615
- You should've
ignored him, man.

54:32.570 --> 54:34.639
- Hey dickhead, nice
job in the double book.

54:34.639 --> 54:36.941
- Ah, what are you
blaming me for, asshole?

54:36.941 --> 54:38.576
- Are you that much of an idiot?

54:39.644 --> 54:40.845
- I had no choice.

54:40.845 --> 54:42.647
Plus, she fell for your
water leak bullshit,

54:42.647 --> 54:43.948
so who the fuck cares?

54:43.948 --> 54:45.049
- Chris is gonna have your ass.

54:45.049 --> 54:46.384
- Oh really?

54:46.384 --> 54:48.353
Who was she screaming
at, me or you?

54:49.454 --> 54:50.588
- I fucking hate you, Henry.

54:50.588 --> 54:52.623
- Oh, well right
back at you, druggie.

54:53.591 --> 54:54.892
- What did you just say?

54:54.892 --> 54:57.428
- Like we all
don't fucking know.

54:58.095 --> 55:00.331
- What, I smoke a
little pot, so what?

55:00.331 --> 55:01.466
- Oh, is that it, what else?

55:01.466 --> 55:02.600
Shoot fucking heroin much?

55:02.600 --> 55:04.502
- Show me the needle
marks then, prick.

55:04.502 --> 55:05.836
I did it once in my life.

55:05.836 --> 55:07.938
- Don't you fucking bullshit me.

55:07.938 --> 55:11.342
You and your girlfriend
got fucking high every day.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.644
That is why she hung herself.

55:17.848 --> 55:19.617
- Tell Chris if he
wants to fire me,

55:19.617 --> 55:21.352
call me before 8 am so I know if

55:21.352 --> 55:23.320
I can sleep in or not.

55:33.464 --> 55:34.932
(Henry groaning)

55:41.739 --> 55:42.907
- Hey.

55:43.741 --> 55:44.842
- Hey.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.844
- I'm sorry about last night.

55:46.844 --> 55:48.946
I really don't know what I said.

55:49.947 --> 55:51.616
- I been there.

55:53.083 --> 55:55.119
Why don't you come inside,
I'l give you that thing.

55:58.456 --> 55:59.690
C'mon.

56:17.508 --> 56:19.710
Sorry the place is such a mess.

56:44.101 --> 56:45.870
- I can't take this from you.

56:45.870 --> 56:47.438
- It's not from me.

56:47.438 --> 56:48.606
- Yes it is.

56:48.606 --> 56:50.007
- No, it's from Davis.

56:50.007 --> 56:51.542
- You got it from him?

56:51.542 --> 56:53.544
- Yeah.

56:53.544 --> 56:54.612
- Bullshit.

56:54.612 --> 56:55.980
If there's one thing I
know about that cocksucker,

56:55.980 --> 56:58.115
it's that he never let
anyone shake him down.

57:01.586 --> 57:02.620
- The money's yours.

57:05.690 --> 57:07.424
- Oh yeah, why?

57:11.929 --> 57:14.198
- How long you lived
in the city, Holly?

57:14.198 --> 57:15.633
- Three years.

57:15.633 --> 57:17.034
- Where are you from originally?

57:19.169 --> 57:21.572
- Red Bank, New Jersey.

57:21.572 --> 57:23.474
- And how old are you?

57:24.509 --> 57:25.843
- 21, detective.

57:26.744 --> 57:27.912
- You got family?

57:29.079 --> 57:30.180
- Yeah.

57:31.549 --> 57:33.217
- They know what you're doing?

57:34.819 --> 57:36.754
Why don't you just go home?

57:46.597 --> 57:48.599
- What happened to your head?

57:48.599 --> 57:50.167
- I just got in a fight.

57:50.167 --> 57:51.636
I got jumped.

57:54.639 --> 57:57.575
- Tino said that,
you and your girl--

57:57.575 --> 57:58.976
- Yeah, yeah.

58:02.547 --> 58:03.614
- She died?

58:05.950 --> 58:07.752
- Yeah, she died.

58:13.023 --> 58:14.124
- And you still,

58:14.124 --> 58:15.726
- I don't inject.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.998
You know, just every once
in a while for the pain.

58:25.570 --> 58:26.704
- Right.

58:32.877 --> 58:35.512
So what do you want from me?

58:36.714 --> 58:38.583
- I just felt bad
about what happened.

58:38.583 --> 58:40.284
- And you wanted to help me?

58:40.284 --> 58:41.819
- Is that wrong?

58:43.588 --> 58:45.790
- Maybe just a little
hard to believe.

58:45.790 --> 58:47.692
- Well believe it.

58:58.869 --> 59:01.305
- So you went and saw Davis?

59:01.305 --> 59:02.607
- Yeah.

59:03.708 --> 59:05.843
Ended up smacking
him upside the head.

59:07.712 --> 59:08.846
- Thanks.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.682
- Don't mention it.

59:11.682 --> 59:13.618
- He's gonna come looking
for me eventually.

59:13.618 --> 59:16.621
- Yeah Holly, you need to
stay away from that guy, okay?

59:16.621 --> 59:18.689
He said he may
kill you next time.

59:22.660 --> 59:24.294
- All this help
you're giving me,

59:24.294 --> 59:26.797
and you don't want
anything in return?

59:28.298 --> 59:30.300
- What could you
possibly give me?

59:44.649 --> 59:46.216
- No, no.

59:46.216 --> 59:47.618
- I'm clean, I've been tested.

59:47.618 --> 59:48.786
- It's not, no, it's not,

59:48.786 --> 59:50.755
I just can't do it,
I'm not over her,

59:50.755 --> 59:53.223
and uh, no.

59:53.223 --> 59:54.692
- It's okay.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:05.502
- No, you just
look like her and,

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:06.403
- Dylan, it's okay.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:07.237
- I'm sorry.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:07.304
I mean, it was a
really great kiss.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.109
Why don't you go home, Holly?

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.243
I'm not talking about
where you live here,

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:15.245
I'm talking about your family.

01:00:19.684 --> 01:00:21.051
Why don't, wait, wait, wait,

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:23.654
why don't you stop by
the hotel tomorrow night?

01:00:24.689 --> 01:00:26.190
- I'm not going back there.

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.391
- Yeah, I realized how
stupid that sounded

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:29.026
right after I said it.

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:31.095
Shit, I don't even know if
I have a job there anymore.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:32.362
- What?

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.833
- Got in a fight with
a dickhead coworker.

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:43.073
Look, why don't you stay here?

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.711
- I've got my own place.

01:00:46.711 --> 01:00:48.846
- Yeah but, you know,
that prick Davis.

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:53.217
Wait, here, look.

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:55.686
Could you write down
your phone number?

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:59.156
Just so I can call you
and check up on you?

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.658
- Gonna be keeping tabs on me?

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:07.164
- I just, yeah, yeah actually.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.433
I just wanna check up on
you every once in a while.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.668
Make sure you're okay.

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:16.173
If I call this
number, you'll answer?

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.746
- Yeah, I'll answer.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:28.953
Bye, Dylan.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:37.928
(piano music)

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.541
- Good, you start tomorrow.

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:26.310
Okay, see you then.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:31.115
- That my replacement?

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:32.316
- No.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:34.451
I fired Henry.

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:36.186
He shouldn't have
said what he said.

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:38.222
Well good, 'cause I was
going to knock him out

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:39.957
every morning until you
got rid of one of us.

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:43.027
- Sit down.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:52.469
What are you doing?

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.038
- Huh?

01:02:54.038 --> 01:02:56.573
- You're not just adjusting
to the night shift.

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:58.075
What are you on?

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:01.145
- You know, I just
been drinking a lot.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.481
- That's all?

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.916
- Yeah, that's all.

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:09.920
(Chris sighs)

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:14.959
- I heard you used
the water leak.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.394
- Worked like a charm.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.229
- I tried it once.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:20.831
Guy didn't believe me.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.900
Had to comp his room
for three nights.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.568
- Patrick created it.

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:26.103
- Forget Patrick, dude.

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.405
You're better than he was.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:30.440
Sure he was a charmer,
but some people,

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.443
he came off like a
used car salesman.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.846
People believe you, Dylan.

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.449
No one, and I mean no
one, could have handled

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.852
that domestic abuse
incident like you did.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:48.859
It just sucks though

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.127
because I have to fire you

01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:52.329
because you're lying
about what you're on.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.164
- You don't have to fire me.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.339
- Tell me what you're on.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.547
- This one time
a few years back,

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.951
Rachel and I were
visiting our friend Eliza

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.520
in Los Angeles, she
lived in the Hills.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.556
And there was this
big 4th of July party.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:22.192
Somebody brought fireworks.

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:24.461
And Rachel lit them off.

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:26.997
She was always doing
crazy shit like that.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:30.300
And these two neighbors came by,

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.936
these guys who thought
they were all tough

01:04:31.936 --> 01:04:34.104
and they told us
that we had violated

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:36.106
the city codes, what
the hell do we know

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.375
about the city
codes in Los Angeles

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.344
we're from New York
City, you know?

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.083
We told Eliza we'd
stop, and we meant it.

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:48.585
But these guys
wouldn't let it go.

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:51.021
They demanded to
know who did it.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:53.090
They wouldn't leave til
them found out who did it.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.996
And I ended up getting in a
fight with one of the guys,

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:01.966
and the cops came, and
the party was ruined.

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.939
- What's the point?

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.079
- The point is,

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:17.014
if these guys had just
taken our word for it

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:20.650
and believed us, everything
would've been fine.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.552
The party could've gone on.

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:27.591
I like you, Chris.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:28.492
You worked your
way up from bellman

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:30.294
to front office manager.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:33.263
And I respect you.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.469
But if I gotta tell
you what I was on,

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:42.672
I'm just gonna quit.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.509
God, it's Thursday, I can just

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:47.444
start my weekend early.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.583
But if you can just
believe me when I tell you

01:05:57.054 --> 01:06:00.424
I'm not going to do it
again, and I mean it,

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:04.561
well then the
party can continue.

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:23.480
Welcome to the Century Grand.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.448
- You're Dylan, right?

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.615
- Yes.

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:28.052
- I'm Dave, this
is my wife Gloria.

01:06:28.052 --> 01:06:30.320
We were here two years
ago on our honeymoon.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.556
You're the same guy
that checked us in.

01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:34.058
- That's great.

01:06:34.058 --> 01:06:36.126
- We had the most fantastic time

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:38.062
staying at the Grand.

01:06:38.062 --> 01:06:40.164
- Well hopefully you'll have
an even better time this time.

01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:41.765
- How've you been?

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:44.434
- Good, I'm the
night manager now.

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:46.436
- That's fantastic.

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:48.605
- I think we have
a king room booked,

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.540
hell, I don't know.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.576
Maybe I can give you 100 reasons

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:55.612
why you might want to
move us to a suite?

01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:58.815
- Those are great reasons.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:01.451
(keys clinking)

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:05.655
- Oh man, I remember
these golden keys!

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.224
- Enjoy your stay, folks.

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:08.592
Enjoy your honeymoon
anniversary.

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:09.693
I'll have a complimentary
bottle of wine

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.628
sent up to your room.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.668
- He give you a tip?

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:20.104
- $100.

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:21.538
Smartest tip in the
world, hotel manager.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.243
- Those two bedroom
suites are $550 a night.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:29.146
- Thank god no more Henry
to piss on my parade.

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:31.548
- The old Dyl, nice
to see you back, man.

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:12.189
- Where's Linda?
(foreboding music)

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:13.423
- Huh?

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.792
- Linda. I haven't seen her.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:19.563
- Me neither.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.567
- Hey guys.

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:25.202
- Cesar, come here.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.904
- Yeah, what's up boss?

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.607
- Have you seen Linda?

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.310
- You didn't hear?

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.612
- Didn't hear what?

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.249
- She got killed.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:46.756
- Shit.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.527
How?

01:08:50.527 --> 01:08:51.828
- Her ex-husband
found out that she was

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:54.430
turning tricks in
order to feed her kid.

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:58.335
She came home from
working, he was there

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:00.170
waiting with a shotgun.

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:05.542
It was in the Times.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:06.910
- Wow, that sucks.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:12.515
- Those exes, they'll
get you every time.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:17.520
Sir, let me get
these bags for you?

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:32.902
(suspenseful music)

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.391
- Hey, Tino.

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:55.659
- Yo, you met up with Holly?

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:56.626
- I did.

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:57.594
- Got that settled?

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:59.696
- Yeah, man listen, do
you know her address?

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:00.964
- Why?

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:04.401
- I need to find her
man, what's it to you?

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.671
- I ain't heard from
her in like a week.

01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:09.606
- Do you have her address?

01:10:09.606 --> 01:10:11.708
You owe me this.

01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:20.350
- 353 west 34th Street.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.519
I don't remember her
apartment, though.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.691
(talks into phone)

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:33.597
(piano music)

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.315
(ringing)

01:10:51.315 --> 01:10:52.382
- [Voiceover] Yeah, what is it?

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:53.350
- I'm looking for Holly?

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:54.851
- [Voiceover] No, I
don't know any Holly.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.686
- I'm sorry.

01:11:01.425 --> 01:11:02.626
- Oh, you ain't
following me in here.

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:03.660
- Why not?

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.661
- Who you here to see?

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:05.362
- Holly.

01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:05.929
- Holly who?

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:07.297
- Holly Stevens.

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:08.532
- She ain't answering,
she ain't here.

01:11:08.532 --> 01:11:09.866
- No no, please man, I'm
her friend, trust me.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:11.501
- Kind of friend that
beats the shit out of her?

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:12.902
- That wasn't me, I swear
to god, that wasn't me.

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:14.538
No no man please, c'mon.

01:11:14.538 --> 01:11:16.640
I think something bad
might've happened to her.

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:18.542
- What do you mean
something bad?

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:19.643
- Get the fuck out of my way.

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:20.944
- I'm calling the police!

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:25.982
(suspenseful music)

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:48.872
(train sounds)

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:03.620
(Holly screams)

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.688
- Dylan!

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:06.656
What are you doing here?

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.091
- Christ, Holly.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:10.527
- [Voiceover] Holly, you okay?

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:11.628
- I'm fine.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:12.762
He's a friend.

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:14.564
- [Voiceover] You sure?

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.701
- Yes.

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:21.771
- I thought you
were dead, Rachel.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.076
- Wait, Dylan.

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:36.686
(Dylan crying)

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:42.025
- It's okay.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:45.361
- Why did you leave me?

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.399
- What do you mean?

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:54.938
- I asked you to stay.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.873
But you didn't.

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:32.476
- [Voiceover] Dyl, I don't
know what happened man,

01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:34.644
but I covered for you.

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:37.514
He came in with this new
guy Tim this morning,

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:40.517
and I told him you had to
run out for an emergency.

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:41.685
So you're cool.

01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:46.490
See you Sunday night.

01:13:50.494 --> 01:13:55.532
(piano music)

01:15:00.597 --> 01:15:05.635
(subdued string music)

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:23.920
* I'll take a walk
round the block

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.690
* To ease it up

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:33.763
* Clear my head
and tire myself out

01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:41.871
* I'll test myself constantly

01:15:42.606 --> 01:15:44.808
* Just to see where

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:50.580
* I end up so afraid

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.617
* Of messing up

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:58.588
*Don't you believe

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:02.592
* That it's better to be free

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:07.363
* Of the things
that make you ill

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:11.868
* All those pills,
they make you ill

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:16.372
* It's kind of ironic,

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:18.708
* Given that is your name

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:20.677
* You will

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:28.284
* But at the same time,
they eat away at you

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:37.093
* The doctor gave me
the wrong damn thing

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.629
* I've looked it up

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:46.670
* Seems I know myself
better than you know anyone

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:53.409
* Don't you believe

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:57.947
* That it's better to be free

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:02.251
* Of the things
that make you ill

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:06.790
* All those pills,
they make you ill *

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:27.711
- I'm headed back to New Jersey.

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:30.780
- That's good,
I'm happy for you.

01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:36.820
Thanks for that night.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.755
- You were worried about me.

01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:40.189
- Yeah, I was.

01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:44.994
- You called me Rachel.

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:49.098
- I'm sorry, I
didn't even realize.

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:01.010
- It's not your fault what
happened to your girl.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.379
We make our own
choices in this world.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.450
- I know.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.189
If you ever need anything

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.692
I'll rent a car, I'll
come to New Jersey.

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:22.098
- Why would I need you?

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:24.934
- Would you just let me
be a guy for a minute?

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:32.809
What're you gonna do in Jersey?

01:18:32.809 --> 01:18:34.710
- I dunno.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.083
- Look, I know you have to
go, and I think it's great.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:41.885
But I don't...

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.155
- What?

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:51.294
- I don't want you to
go without knowing...

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:38.007
(subdued guitar music)

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:57.460
* Butterflies, tinted eyes
falling down to the sea

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.564
* At high tide, bringing me

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.900
* Back to the place

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.169
* I can feel

01:20:07.871 --> 01:20:09.072
* Love

01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:12.341
* She bring me back home

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:23.252
* Coffee cup,
belly up to the bar

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:25.488
* We walk in pairs

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:28.524
* Scattered by numbers

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:32.328
* Dare us to stare at the signs

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.199
* Written everywhere

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.471
* The end of time is here

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.441
* Beware

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.846
* If you believe

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:54.450
* There's a heaven

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:02.491
* Somewhere between

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:06.329
* You and me

01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:08.431
* You and me

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:11.901
* Well I will try

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:18.041
* To believe there's a heaven

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.480
* But the angel gone blind

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.550
* In the sweet summer snow

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.586
* I hardly remember

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:35.291
* What I used to know

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:41.364
* What I used to know

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:47.003
* What I used to

01:21:49.172 --> 01:21:50.606
* Know

01:21:55.411 --> 01:22:00.083
* Rattling across open place

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:05.554
* Truth look on with disdain

01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:08.557
* At the fear

01:22:09.492 --> 01:22:14.530
* No one will claim
at the end of the day

01:22:15.298 --> 01:22:20.336
* Desire remains

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:26.109
* And if you believe

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:30.146
* There's a heaven
