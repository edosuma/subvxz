09:55.052 --> 09:57.096
Well, your biopsy results are back, but,

09:57.263 --> 09:59.056
they don't clarify
the diagnostic picture very much.

'cause I don't even know
what you're saying.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.318
DR. SWAN: Being unable to identify
the specific agent

10:10.401 --> 10:12.361
that damaged your heart
doesn't change the fact

10:12.445 --> 10:14.322
that... we need to operate.

-Oh.
-Treating the infection isn't gonna help?

You might wanna make rounds with me

10:32.089 --> 10:34.383
Right, but given your clinical picture
on a risk reward basis,

10:34.717 --> 10:37.303
I don't think the IVAD implant
really makes any sense.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.681
May I have a little water, please?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.476
DR. SWAN: Putting that device in,
is a separate major operation.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.312
And since I think that we're gonna have
to go to transplant anyway,

10:46.437 --> 10:48.105
I... I'd like to avoid
putting you through it.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.567
And that's unless your balloon pump
starts chewing up your body and...

10:51.692 --> 10:54.362
-What do you mean, chewing up his body?
-That's a figure of speech.

Dr. Carreras is part of the medical staff.

They extracted a .25 caliber bullet.

Thanks very much.

41:29.361 --> 41:32.406
-Tell him good job, Medavoy.
-Uh, everyone expresses appreciation.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.824
Much as I break his balls.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.370
(SIGHS) I don't know
how much you all heard.

41:38.787 --> 41:40.998
Uh... permissions were all secured.

41:41.248 --> 41:45.461
Um... they're gonna harvest
the poor fella's heart over at Bellevue.

41:45.586 --> 41:50.174
(INHALES) And then, uh, transport it
over to where Bobby is at NYU,

41:50.799 --> 41:54.887
and then, evidently,
the transplant procedure will begin.

41:55.221 --> 41:58.057
(TAPPING)

41:59.099 --> 42:01.685
Um... it was a uniformed cop
named Gilliam.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.605
-Six years on the job.
-All in Midtown South?

42:05.397 --> 42:08.192
-Uh... I don't know.
-Got a line on the guys that did it?

42:08.359 --> 42:12.112
-Yeah. I don't know.
-I'm gonna go call Midtown South.

42:20.079 --> 42:24.500
(EXHALES) If it had to happen,
all's I can say...

42:24.708 --> 42:29.296
(BREATHES HEAVILY) ...I am so glad
Bobby's gonna have a shot.

42:32.841 --> 42:33.842
(EXHALES)

42:46.897 --> 42:49.608
We caught a break, Bobby.
You went from third to first.

42:50.025 --> 42:52.486
We got a directed donation
from the widow of another cop.

42:53.862 --> 42:55.906
-Your husband's gonna get a heart.
-When?

42:55.990 --> 42:57.741
Oh, we're not gonna let any grass
grow under our feet.

42:58.075 --> 43:00.077
We'll take Bobby
into the operating room now,

43:00.494 --> 43:02.204
Get him ready for the procedure,

43:02.329 --> 43:04.582
and as soon as the organ arrives
from Bellevue... (INHALES)

43:04.665 --> 43:06.000
...we're ready to go.

43:06.875 --> 43:11.922
-Did you hear Dr. Swan, Bobby?
-Sounds like we're going into action.

43:12.214 --> 43:13.757
DR. SWAN: I'm gonna go downstairs
to scrub.

43:13.966 --> 43:17.678
Dr. Russell's gonna give you some Versed
to help you relax. (INHALES)

43:17.761 --> 43:19.763
And then he'll administer
your anesthetic downstairs.

43:21.015 --> 43:25.853
Doc? Could we hold off
on the relaxing medication

43:25.936 --> 43:27.479
until I get downstairs?

43:29.440 --> 43:30.566
Sure. We can do that.

43:33.193 --> 43:34.653
Keeping my eyes open...

43:36.363 --> 43:37.948
so I can see my girl.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.144
