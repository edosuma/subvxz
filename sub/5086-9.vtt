WEBVTT

00:16.600 --> 00:19.767
Mariah, you look great. Your
mom's gonna love your outfit.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.700
Will Mom be here when
we get home from school?

00:21.767 --> 00:25.000
No. Uncle Matt and I are
getting her at two o'clock.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.200
You and Rachel are going
home with Hailey and her mom.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.200
And boys: you're gonna
go with Mr. Watkins.

00:29.267 --> 00:30.633
All right.

00:30.700 --> 00:35.767
But Mom will be staying
here? Like, all of us? Here?

00:35.833 --> 00:39.733
Yeah. We want your mom to
take her time finding a job

00:39.800 --> 00:44.533
and getting organized, before
she looks for another place.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.600
Wait, so we're
not leaving?

00:47.667 --> 00:49.833
No, not until
your mom's ready.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.167
We don't want
to rush her.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.433
Uncle Matt even cleaned
out his office for her.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.100
We don't want her to
feel uncomfortable.

00:57.167 --> 00:58.900
Best foot forward
and all that.

00:58.967 --> 01:01.900
So cool of you,
Uncle Matt. Thank you!

01:01.967 --> 01:04.433
No problem. But before
any of that happens,

01:04.500 --> 01:05.933
we've got to get
to school, right?

01:06.067 --> 01:09.733
Come on people, let's go!
This is you. There you are.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.433
Wow. When we sit down
for dinner tonight,

01:12.500 --> 01:15.200
Mom will be with us.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.267
Good morning Leslie.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.567
Allison, Devin.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.300
Andrew Wheeler.
Sixty-six years old.

01:44.367 --> 01:47.367
Cause of death...
pretty obvious.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.267
Is that a soda bottle?

01:49.333 --> 01:52.733
Yeah, part of one. I may go
back to drinking from cans.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.233
Watch and wallet are gone.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.233
Uniforms found a stack of
business cards in the car.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.267
CEO of Surge Fiber Optics.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.067
Any other signs
of trauma?

02:01.100 --> 02:02.700
Light contusions
consistent with a struggle,

02:02.767 --> 02:05.200
but I'll go over him more
carefully when I get him back.

02:05.267 --> 02:09.467
Nothing stands out.
Well, except the...

02:09.533 --> 02:11.367
Robbery gone wrong?

02:11.433 --> 02:14.567
Something gone wrong. Big
chunk of glass to the heart?

02:14.633 --> 02:16.767
Lot of anger in
that choice.

02:16.833 --> 02:19.067
First Uniform on scene is
the man paramedics found

02:19.100 --> 02:23.700
with the body. Terrence Figg,
says he worked for the victim.

02:23.767 --> 02:25.933
Thanks Leslie. Let us
know what else you find.

02:26.067 --> 02:26.933
Yup!

02:28.100 --> 02:30.200
Mr. Figg?

02:30.267 --> 02:31.567
Yes, I'm Terrence Figg.

02:31.633 --> 02:33.567
Detective McLean, Detective
Stewart. We understand

02:33.633 --> 02:36.067
you were with the body
when our people arrived?

02:36.067 --> 02:41.367
Yes. When I got here
he was just...

02:41.433 --> 02:44.100
Andrew was my
boss and my mentor.

02:44.167 --> 02:45.367
We're very sorry
for your loss.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.467
Thank you. It's not
just a loss for me,

02:47.533 --> 02:51.133
it's a loss for our
entire industry.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.333
Did he have a family?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.467
Yes, it's a
tragedy for them.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.300
Were you two scheduled
to meet out here?

02:59.367 --> 03:01.167
No. He missed his first
appointment of the day,

03:01.233 --> 03:04.200
which is not like him, so
I called a couple of times.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.100
He didn't pick up,
also not like him.

03:06.167 --> 03:08.567
I left messages, but he
never returned them.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.600
Also not like him?

03:10.667 --> 03:13.600
We're two weeks from our
IPO. His schedule is

03:13.667 --> 03:17.267
booked by the minute and we're
in constant contact 24/7.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.733
And the park wasn't
on his schedule?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.400
So, how did you
know he was here?

03:21.467 --> 03:25.600
His car. Our company cars are
equipped with GPS transponders.

03:25.667 --> 03:28.100
When he didn't make his
appointment, I called security.

03:28.167 --> 03:32.267
I knew something was wrong,
but I never imagined...

03:32.333 --> 03:34.333
Do you have any idea
why he would be

03:34.400 --> 03:35.667
at the park
this morning?

03:35.733 --> 03:38.967
Believe me, he was not a
sit-in-the-sun type of guy.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.567
I wanted to ask you
about his briefcase.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.533
The officer said there
was nothing in the car?

03:42.600 --> 03:44.967
No briefcase in the
car, no wallet on the body.

03:45.067 --> 03:47.667
There was a mark on his wrist
from a watch, but no watch.

03:47.733 --> 03:50.367
He wears a Tag Heuer Carrera
and he carries a Pontevedra

03:50.433 --> 03:52.800
briefcase. They're both
worth thousands.

03:52.867 --> 03:57.400
But the IPO paperwork in that
briefcase is beyond value.

03:57.467 --> 03:59.333
Well, we hope to
find all of it.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.767
Please let us know if
you have anything else.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.867
I will, thank you.

04:06.367 --> 04:09.100
So, Wheeler doesn't come into
work. Doesn't say anything,

04:09.167 --> 04:11.600
because he doesn't want anyone
to know where he's going.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.300
And then he's intercepted
by the robber,

04:13.367 --> 04:14.833
who doesn't bring
his own weapon,

04:14.900 --> 04:16.967
so has to grab
something nearby?

04:17.067 --> 04:19.800
Could be a crime
of opportunity.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.100
Don't think there are a lot
of Tag Heuers and Pontevedra's

04:22.167 --> 04:23.767
floating around that park.

04:23.833 --> 04:25.467
Maybe.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.933
But Figg was worried about
what was in the briefcase.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.667
Detectives, I just
spoke to Angelo Russo,

04:30.733 --> 04:32.300
owner of Russo's
Pawnbrokers.

04:32.367 --> 04:33.933
Says items matching
descriptions of the victim's

04:34.067 --> 04:36.933
belongings turned
up at his store.

04:39.333 --> 04:42.133
Mr. Russo and me,
we go way back.

04:42.200 --> 04:47.067
I sell to him all the time.
He's the fairest guy in town.

04:47.100 --> 04:50.100
Shanahan, over on
Tidewater, he's a cheat.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.467
You should shut him down.

04:52.533 --> 04:54.933
Mr. Russo said the wallet
and briefcase were empty

04:55.067 --> 04:56.467
when you traded them in.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.533
I left the credit
cards in the wallet,

04:58.600 --> 05:01.633
I only took the
cash and the watch.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.067
Other than that, the
briefcase was empty.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.533
When you found it beside Mr.
Wheeler's body in Winston Park.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.933
What body?

05:08.067 --> 05:09.867
I took all that
stuff out of a dumpster.

05:09.933 --> 05:14.067
In the alley off Lincoln,
behind the Royal Drugs.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.867
I find a lot of
great stuff in there.

05:15.933 --> 05:19.067
Did it occur to you, for nice
things to be in a dumpster,

05:19.100 --> 05:21.067
something bad
might've happened?

05:21.100 --> 05:23.533
Bad things
happen all the time.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.467
Wasting nice
stuff makes it worse.

05:27.533 --> 05:30.533
Did you spend the night in
Winston Park last night?

05:30.600 --> 05:32.867
And hang around there a
little bit this morning?

05:32.933 --> 05:38.433
Why should you care what--
I didn't kill anybody.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.667
And I didn't sleep in
Winston last night.

05:40.733 --> 05:44.067
It looked like rain, so I went
to the shelter at St. Sebastian.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.200
Harry, we're gonna need
to keep you overnight,

05:46.267 --> 05:47.567
until we can
check your story.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.400
Sure. Still looks
like rain,

05:50.467 --> 05:55.333
and a dry bed's one of those
good things you shouldn't waste.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.933
Babies, mama's home!

06:08.067 --> 06:10.233
Mommy!

06:14.167 --> 06:16.733
I'm hoping the fact she can
quote her rehab counsellor in

06:16.800 --> 06:19.767
excruciating detail means she
took the process seriously.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.833
After that drive, I can
quote her rehab counsellor

06:21.900 --> 06:23.600
in excruciating detail.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.100
Seriously, we want
her to know that

06:25.167 --> 06:26.433
we want her to
be successful.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.467
I don't want her to
let her kids down.

06:28.533 --> 06:31.767
Yes and we need to be
supportive and encouraging,

06:31.833 --> 06:36.967
and help her find a job
and a place and a program.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.533
Let's get through
dinner first.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.433
Breakfast is ready!

06:47.333 --> 06:51.133
Whoa, Momma.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.300
I was coming to get you
up, but you're all...

06:54.367 --> 06:55.933
This is really nice.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.800
I have an interview today,
so I wanted to start my day

06:58.867 --> 07:00.833
in a peaceful and
meditative space.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.600
An interview?
Like for a job?

07:04.667 --> 07:06.167
For a receptionist position.

07:06.233 --> 07:09.167
One of the counsellors
arranged it for me.

07:09.233 --> 07:11.067
Aunt Jackie!
This is amazing.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.367
Yeah!

07:12.433 --> 07:15.233
Wow, I wish we didn't
have to leave for school.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.667
Mom?
You did all this?

07:17.733 --> 07:20.900
Sure did!
Morning honey.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.133
Morning.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.667
Wow, should we take
this feast to go?

07:26.733 --> 07:28.333
Yeah, bring
extra napkins.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.067
Don't want any goop on the
upholstery or sleeves.

07:32.067 --> 07:32.800
Good luck, Mom.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.100
Thanks babe.

07:34.167 --> 07:37.067
Good luck, what for?

07:38.667 --> 07:42.067
You're gonna do great.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.233
Bye guys!

07:44.300 --> 07:46.067
Sorry we didn't get a
chance to enjoy your

07:46.067 --> 07:47.500
beautiful breakfast.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.733
No worries.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.067
I didn't think about how
hard it must be to get

07:51.067 --> 07:53.133
all six of you out of
the house on time.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.667
Some days are easier than
others. Do you need a ride?

07:55.733 --> 07:58.233
No, I have the bus schedule
on my phone so I'm okay.

07:58.300 --> 08:01.800
Okay, good luck.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.800
Have a good day.

08:06.933 --> 08:10.100
There's Harry.

08:10.167 --> 08:13.200
Behind Royal Drugs,
just like he said.

08:13.267 --> 08:14.900
This is the only
camera in the area,

08:14.967 --> 08:17.767
but if we back up from here,
we might get a look at

08:17.833 --> 08:20.700
whoever dropped
Wheeler's belongings.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.067
Wait, can you go back?

08:27.133 --> 08:31.867
Can you zoom in?

08:31.933 --> 08:34.533
There...

08:36.133 --> 08:39.067
that's our killer.

09:03.467 --> 09:06.067
Yes, we can confirm that these
items belong to my father.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.067
Our father.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.867
It must sound shallow, but
to be able to hold this,

09:11.933 --> 09:17.400
even through the plastic, just
for a moment; it comforts me.

09:20.067 --> 09:23.533
I gave him this for our
twenty-fifth anniversary.

09:23.600 --> 09:28.833
It's engraved, To my one and
only. Did you notice that?

09:28.900 --> 09:31.667
Yes, ma'am, we did.

09:33.733 --> 09:36.067
What about his medallion?

09:36.100 --> 09:37.267
What kind of medallion?

09:37.333 --> 09:42.200
Small, bronze. On a chain.
He wore it every day.

09:42.267 --> 09:46.167
A Latin phrase I
couldn't remember...

09:48.433 --> 09:50.400
How embarrassing.

09:50.467 --> 09:55.067
Andrew would be so
disappointed in all of us.

09:55.067 --> 09:58.333
We'll follow up on
that, Mrs. Wheeler.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.100
So this is all
you brought us?

10:01.167 --> 10:03.267
Other than the medallion, is
there anything else you think

10:03.333 --> 10:04.800
your father may
have had with him?

10:04.867 --> 10:06.633
I'm looking for
news, Detective.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.633
I'd like to think you've made
some progress finding the

10:08.700 --> 10:10.700
maniac who couldn't stop
with robbing my father,

10:10.767 --> 10:14.367
but had to kill him too?

10:17.100 --> 10:19.333
We now think his belongings
were taken to make it look

10:19.400 --> 10:23.067
like a robbery.
To cover the homicide.

10:23.133 --> 10:27.867
He was...
deliberately murdered?

10:30.400 --> 10:32.933
We think he went to
the park to meet someone,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.600
and that person killed him.

10:35.667 --> 10:39.000
Is there anyone you can think of
who'd want to hurt Mr. Wheeler?

10:39.067 --> 10:43.933
No.
No one at all.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.533
Maura, Rick, you work for
your father, don't you?

10:48.600 --> 10:50.033
Yes.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.467
Dad believed that his children
should continue his legacy.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.100
Two-thirds of his children.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.633
Kyle, our youngest, is a
professor at McGregor

10:56.700 --> 10:57.967
in Portland.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.533
Kyle rejects
everything we stand for.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.767
This is not a time to
display our differences.

11:04.633 --> 11:07.833
Terrence Figg told us that Surge
is coming up with an IPO soon.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.633
Of course he did. You need to
go back and talk to him again.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.133
What did I just say?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.367
It's important for them
to know this, Mother.

11:14.433 --> 11:17.067
Terrence thinks he's worked
harder than the rest of us have.

11:17.067 --> 11:20.400
He and Dad had a huge fight
about stock options and the IPO.

11:20.467 --> 11:24.400
Everyone on the floor heard
it. It was loud and ugly.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.167
Hi Aunt Jackie.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.533
Hey, Mom.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.933
Hi honey.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.500
How'd the interview go?

11:35.567 --> 11:38.400
It was really good.

11:38.467 --> 11:40.400
Hey Cam.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.867
Hey, Mom.

11:41.933 --> 11:45.633
Did Uncle Matt
go back to work?

11:45.700 --> 11:49.967
Great.
Come on in. Sit down.

11:53.933 --> 11:57.067
I've been wanting to
talk to you guys.

11:57.067 --> 12:03.333
In rehab I learned that you
have to make amends to the

12:03.400 --> 12:10.900
people that you hurt
when you were using.

12:10.967 --> 12:15.233
And I had this
really big realization.

12:15.300 --> 12:19.333
I should've kept the house
up more and I should've been

12:19.400 --> 12:21.867
more involved in your school,
and I should've got to know your

12:21.933 --> 12:25.300
friends, I should've
taken better care of myself.

12:28.267 --> 12:30.700
But I want you to know
that I know that now,

12:30.767 --> 12:34.233
and I'm doing that,
I'm making those changes,

12:34.300 --> 12:38.300
and you're going to
see that in me.

12:45.067 --> 12:49.500
That's it?

12:51.467 --> 12:54.567
Glad you got that
all worked out.

12:57.733 --> 13:02.267
...potential investors need to
understand that the promise of

13:02.333 --> 13:09.933
Surge is as... I'm sorry
we'll have to end here.

13:10.067 --> 13:12.933
Andrea will reach out
to schedule a new time.

13:13.067 --> 13:15.800
Okay, thanks Terrence.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.767
Detectives, how
can I help you?

13:17.833 --> 13:21.067
By answering some
questions, Mr. Figg.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.800
We'll reconvene in
Andrew's office.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.200
Most of my files
are there already.

13:24.267 --> 13:27.600
You're working out of Mr.
Wheeler's office already?

13:27.667 --> 13:29.067
It's a critical
time for the company,

13:29.067 --> 13:30.300
someone had to step in.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.633
Oh, because of the IPO.

13:32.700 --> 13:37.300
It's what Andrew would have
wanted. Please, have a seat.

13:37.367 --> 13:40.100
How can I help you?

13:42.067 --> 13:47.900
We believe that Mr. Wheeler
was killed by someone he knew.

13:47.967 --> 13:51.100
That's hard to believe.

13:51.167 --> 13:53.300
Your dedication to
this company is obvious,

13:53.367 --> 13:56.733
but was there ever any
tension between you two?

13:56.800 --> 14:01.800
Tension? You've been
talking to Rick.

14:01.867 --> 14:03.567
You and Rick
don't get along?

14:03.633 --> 14:05.900
Rick's always been jealous of my
relationship with his father.

14:05.967 --> 14:08.200
And while Rick does what Rick
does best, which is complain

14:08.267 --> 14:11.267
about me, I do what I do
best, which is run Surge.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.500
Exactly as Andrew wanted.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.933
What about your loud, ugly fight
with Andrew a few days ago?

14:16.067 --> 14:17.433
Is that how he described it?

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
I would have expected
something more hyperbolic.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.800
What were you two
fighting about?

14:20.867 --> 14:24.200
We weren't. It was a
passionate negotiation.

14:24.267 --> 14:26.467
Andrew wouldn't have respected
me if I had accepted

14:26.533 --> 14:29.933
his first offer. That's how
the game is played.

14:30.067 --> 14:33.767
What game were you playing
when you hurt your hand?

14:38.700 --> 14:41.867
I'm not proud of this, but
after the news yesterday I

14:41.933 --> 14:43.733
went home and I
drank a lot of scotch.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.700
At some point, I slammed my
glass down it shattered and...

14:47.767 --> 14:52.467
My assistant just helped
me change the bandage.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.233
I will show you if you like.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.967
I'm an idiot,
but I'm not a killer.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.833
You should show a doctor.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.667
Later.
Business first.

15:02.733 --> 15:04.500
Now if you'll excuse
me, I have three meetings.

15:04.567 --> 15:08.267
One of my assistants
will show you out.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.833
Sorry, do you
have a trash can?

15:11.900 --> 15:14.867
In the corner by
the coffee machine.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.533
If you have any ideas about
who Mr. Wheeler might have

15:23.600 --> 15:25.600
been meeting in the park
you'll give us a call,

15:25.667 --> 15:27.067
You'll be the first to know.

15:27.133 --> 15:30.167
Thank you. We appreciate
your cooperation.

15:35.700 --> 15:36.900
Thanks for the distraction.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.300
You get it?

15:38.367 --> 15:41.400
Now we'll know if Mr.
Figg's blood was at the scene.

15:47.067 --> 15:51.233
Guys, it's a school
night. Time for bed.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.233
Good night.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.367
Night.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.533
Night.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.167
Night, honey.

16:01.733 --> 16:09.067
Just a little bit longer? We
used to do this all the time.

16:09.067 --> 16:15.400
I'm done. Track practice was
brutal this afternoon, so...

16:15.467 --> 16:16.433
Night.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.333
Night.

16:20.867 --> 16:24.567
You know what? Your
Aunt Allison's right.

16:24.633 --> 16:28.600
It's a school night,
so... up you go.

16:32.067 --> 16:32.767
Night.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.067
Good night.

16:40.233 --> 16:44.667
Guess it's my
bedtime too, right?

16:46.333 --> 16:48.900
Good night, Jackie.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.067
Coffee?

17:01.067 --> 17:02.900
No, thanks. I have the
results on the crime scene

17:02.967 --> 17:04.633
blood sample versus the
bandage sample.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.333
Was it Terrence
Figg's blood at the scene?

17:06.400 --> 17:09.667
No.
But have a look.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.900
The blood on the victim is a
descendant selector to the

17:11.967 --> 17:14.167
victim himself.
Which means...

17:14.233 --> 17:19.600
Andrew Wheeler was murdered
by one of his children.

17:20.500 --> 17:24.800
...and finally, I want to thank
you all, not just for your

17:24.867 --> 17:28.800
support and kind words over
the last few days, But for your

17:28.867 --> 17:32.767
dedication to this company,
and everything Andrew valued.

17:34.967 --> 17:38.167
I hope you'll offer that same
support to our children as

17:38.233 --> 17:40.700
they carry on.

17:40.767 --> 17:44.267
I look forward to seeing each
one of you at the service.

17:56.933 --> 17:59.900
Your husband
was a great man.

18:07.233 --> 18:10.667
Detectives. My brother,
Professor Kyle Wheeler.

18:10.733 --> 18:12.733
I came up from Portland
as quickly as I could.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.133
Our condolences, Professor.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.933
We're sorry to intrude, but
could we speak to the two of

18:18.067 --> 18:19.833
you and your
sister in private?

18:19.900 --> 18:21.300
Has there been
a development?

18:21.367 --> 18:22.700
Maybe we could
use your office?

18:22.767 --> 18:24.200
What have you found out?
Tell us.

18:24.267 --> 18:25.533
Why are you here?
What's going on?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.533
They won't tell us.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.667
We need DNA samples
from all three of you.

18:34.233 --> 18:36.100
You think one of
us killed Dad?

18:36.167 --> 18:38.200
We use DNA to rule
out people as well.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.967
That's absurd. And I'm not
voluntarily giving you

18:41.067 --> 18:42.867
a DNA sample.
Get a warrant.

18:42.933 --> 18:47.633
From our experience, Professor,
that's a guilty man's response.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.700
Anything else
you want in there?

18:58.667 --> 19:02.800
We're good. You two can
use swabs if you prefer.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.967
an I have everyone'sC
ttention, please?a

19:07.067 --> 19:10.433
'd like to say a fewI
ords while we're all here.w

19:10.500 --> 19:11.633
I can't believe him.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.433
No one loved Andrew Wheeler
more, or did more

19:13.500 --> 19:15.600
to enact his
vision.....

19:15.667 --> 19:18.433
This is not
about you, Figg.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.167
Shut Up!

19:27.167 --> 19:31.133
Yes detective, I would
like to press charges.

19:39.867 --> 19:43.067
Okay, that's the sample,
now we need the alibi.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.600
Your brother and
sister gave us both.

19:46.667 --> 19:52.933
Rick? Where were you on the
morning your father was killed?

19:54.767 --> 19:56.867
Stalling only
makes it worse.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.700
Sitting in the restaurant
at the Four Seasons.

20:05.767 --> 20:08.367
Waiting for him.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.933
Did you meet
there often?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.800
No. But I had to invite my own
father to breakfast

20:16.867 --> 20:19.100
just to have a conversation
with him. I needed to

20:19.167 --> 20:22.567
be clear on my role in the
company after we go public.

20:22.633 --> 20:26.367
Terrence got all of Dad's
attention in the office.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.300
How long did
you wait for him?

20:28.367 --> 20:32.433
Over an hour. I kept staring
at the door, thinking,

20:32.500 --> 20:36.067
Another five minutes,
another five minutes.

20:36.133 --> 20:40.300
I didn't want to believe that my
own father would stand me up.

20:40.367 --> 20:43.400
It never occurred to me that
something horrible had happened.

20:43.467 --> 20:46.233
I should have called Dad, but
I'm his son and I shouldn't have

20:46.300 --> 20:51.700
to grovel for his love, but if
I'd reached him, if I'd gotten

20:51.767 --> 20:53.867
him to come to me instead of
going to the park,

20:53.933 --> 20:55.067
then he'd still...

20:56.333 --> 20:58.333
I'm sorry, Yes?

20:58.400 --> 21:01.400
Excuse me, Detective McLean,
your sister-in-law's here.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.333
Who brought her in?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.367
The bus?

21:08.333 --> 21:11.767
Jackie!
Is everything okay?

21:11.833 --> 21:15.633
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sorry for barging in.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.067
Come this way.

21:17.133 --> 21:20.600
I had a great idea that I
wanted to share with you.

21:20.667 --> 21:24.233
An idea about what?
Have a seat.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.200
Everything's
been going so great.

21:29.267 --> 21:33.667
The kids, the interview,
it just feels so good,

21:33.733 --> 21:37.633
and I wanted to maybe make
everyone dinner to celebrate.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.300
You wanna cook?

21:39.367 --> 21:40.733
Is that okay?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.267
Yeah.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.800
I had this idea what I want to
make, but I need to pick up

21:44.867 --> 21:46.767
some stuff, and you know
groceries on the bus is hard.

21:50.533 --> 21:53.300
So, I wanted to
borrow your car?

21:53.367 --> 21:59.500
Yeah, absolutely. I'll just
have Devin drive me home.

21:59.567 --> 22:00.700
Thank you.

22:00.767 --> 22:02.800
It's space 28,
Just past the flagpole.

22:02.867 --> 22:04.067
28, okay

22:04.067 --> 22:10.633
Wait, why don't
you take this?

22:10.700 --> 22:15.600
Yeah.
Thank you, Allison.

22:19.367 --> 22:21.933
Rick says he was at
breakfast. Motive?

22:22.067 --> 22:24.633
Jealousy. Terrence was
taking over the company.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.067
And his father's love.

22:29.067 --> 22:30.867
Maura said she
was at spin class.

22:30.933 --> 22:34.067
Goes to the same
one every Wednesday.

22:34.067 --> 22:36.733
She's pretty locked down.

22:36.800 --> 22:42.300
But she doesn't seem to have a
specific issue with her father.

22:42.367 --> 22:46.333
And Kyle was at an anti-fracking
protest in Portland.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.233
Rick said Kyle despised
everything his father stood for.

22:49.300 --> 22:52.467
Maybe he despised
the man, too.

23:00.467 --> 23:05.100
We need to dig into
these alibis more deeply.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.700
Somebody isn't
telling the truth.

23:23.267 --> 23:24.633
What's going on?

23:24.700 --> 23:28.067
Jackie needed some space while
she finished cooking dinner.

23:28.067 --> 23:30.200
We offered to help, but...

23:30.267 --> 23:31.667
Everything's fine!

23:41.567 --> 23:42.833
Hey.

23:42.900 --> 23:47.067
Hi! So my roommate in
rehab, she was a chef.

23:47.067 --> 23:50.067
She says that the key to a
great meal is in the timing.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.867
Well, it smells fantastic.
What can I do to help?

23:52.933 --> 23:58.967
Nothing, I have it all under
control, I'm just... Oh, shoot!

23:59.067 --> 24:02.733
I'm sure they'll
be fine, I hope.

24:03.333 --> 24:07.733
Just get them off... and...

24:13.333 --> 24:17.233
I think that my timing
is a little bit off, but...

24:17.300 --> 24:19.467
Did you want these whipped?

24:19.533 --> 24:22.567
Um, sure... No,
not with butter!

24:22.633 --> 24:25.367
I'll get you some...

24:26.700 --> 24:30.600
Oh no, no no no...
No!

24:36.100 --> 24:38.633
Oh, Jackie.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.200
I didn't get the job.

24:43.267 --> 24:46.867
Apparently I'm not qualified
to sit behind a desk and say

24:46.933 --> 24:48.367
Welcome, please have a
seat.

24:48.433 --> 24:50.600
I'm so sorry Jackie.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.567
I guess it's official: you're
better than me at everything.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.900
What are you looking for?

25:12.967 --> 25:16.100
Paperwork for
the Ramsay estate.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.367
What is this?

25:18.433 --> 25:20.867
Mariah asked me to
put them someplace else,

25:20.933 --> 25:22.067
for Jackie's sake.

25:22.133 --> 25:24.967
And there was nowhere
else that could go?

25:26.500 --> 25:27.967
Do you want some help?

25:28.067 --> 25:30.133
Yeah, find the Ramsay file,
That would be great!

25:32.233 --> 25:34.400
It's in the study. Am I
allowed to go down there?

25:34.467 --> 25:36.900
Can I ask Jackie whether
it's okay if I go look for it?

25:36.967 --> 25:38.500
I'll go.

25:38.567 --> 25:42.167
Don't worry about it, I'll get
it in the morning. I'm just...

25:44.700 --> 25:46.067
Babe, I know
this has been hard.

25:46.067 --> 25:48.067
But I really believe we're
doing the right thing...

25:48.067 --> 25:50.133
I am so sick of
doing the right thing!

25:50.200 --> 25:51.933
You know what the right
thing means around here?

25:52.067 --> 25:54.067
It means us picking up
everybody else's slack,

25:54.133 --> 25:56.567
us cleaning up after
everybody else's mistakes.

25:56.633 --> 25:57.733
We both agreed that...

25:57.800 --> 26:00.400
No, you agreed. I went
along with you.

26:00.467 --> 26:03.667
Out of love for you.
Not some greater good.

26:03.733 --> 26:06.933
You have to admit that Cameron
and Mariah are better here.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.533
They're great.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.200
Yeah. And I've also seen that
our children have been cheated

26:11.267 --> 26:13.900
on time and
space and attention.

26:13.967 --> 26:17.067
And our savings is basically
toast. And now Jackie?

26:17.067 --> 26:18.333
Shhh!

26:18.400 --> 26:19.533
Tell you what? Why don't I
build an addition,

26:19.600 --> 26:20.967
that way when Tim gets
out of prison,

26:21.067 --> 26:23.433
we can have your strung
out, paroled brother move in.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.900
I want to teach our children
that when people are in trouble,

26:25.967 --> 26:28.200
you help them. When they're
hurting, you comfort them.

26:28.267 --> 26:29.900
When they need you,
you're there for them,

26:29.967 --> 26:32.167
even if it's not
easy or convenient.

26:32.233 --> 26:35.200
And when that's repaid with
ingratitude? And anger?

26:35.267 --> 26:38.967
And pain? Then what,
Allison? Then what?

26:39.067 --> 26:41.533
He's my brother.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.700
And I'm your husband.

26:59.433 --> 27:00.767
Mrs. Wheeler.

27:00.833 --> 27:04.167
I'm sorry, no one told
me that you were here.

27:04.233 --> 27:07.800
Which one of my children do
you think killed their father?

27:07.867 --> 27:10.067
The Medical Examiner is
running the DNA tests again.

27:10.100 --> 27:12.100
There was a problem, the
results were inconclusive.

27:12.167 --> 27:18.500
No, wait. The smart money
should be on Maura.

27:18.567 --> 27:20.133
Why Maura?

27:20.200 --> 27:22.533
She can be very cold,
and very calculating.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.067
Just like her father.
But she didn't do this.

27:26.067 --> 27:30.800
Maura idolized Andrew. She would
never do anything to hurt him.

27:30.867 --> 27:34.700
That leaves Rick and Kyle.

27:34.767 --> 27:38.833
Never ask a mother to
choose between her sons.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.767
I'm supposed to sign some
paperwork so they'll finally

27:41.833 --> 27:44.633
release Andrew's body.
Do you know where I do that?

27:44.700 --> 27:48.267
Yes, of course. Officer?
Can you escort Mrs. Wheeler

27:48.333 --> 27:49.733
to the Medical Examiner's
office, please?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.100
Thank you.

27:52.867 --> 27:56.267
Did you ever find
Andrew's medallion?

27:56.333 --> 27:59.100
No, I'm sorry,
we haven't.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.600
I look forward to your
catching the killer.

28:08.467 --> 28:15.500
Hey, so I just got off the
phone with Mr. Carl Snyder.

28:15.567 --> 28:17.300
Twenty-two years
with Seattle PD,

28:17.367 --> 28:20.300
now a private investigator
with great reviews on Yelp.

28:20.367 --> 28:23.567
And how is Mr. Snyder?

28:23.633 --> 28:25.833
He's very, very happy
with the big fat check

28:25.900 --> 28:28.967
Maura Wheeler wrote him.

28:29.067 --> 28:30.333
Did you find that in
Maura's financials?

28:30.400 --> 28:31.567
Yeah.

28:31.633 --> 28:33.333
What did Mr. Snyder
have to say about her?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.333
Hr didn't want to
comment at all initially,

28:35.400 --> 28:37.467
but when I told
him it was a murder,

28:37.533 --> 28:39.867
memories of his days in
blue convinced him to share.

28:39.933 --> 28:41.800
What did Maura have him do?

28:41.867 --> 28:43.933
Find out if her father
was cheating on her mother.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.500
Which he was.

28:45.567 --> 28:47.800
How did she
feel about that.

28:47.867 --> 28:50.067
I want to get
this just right.

28:50.067 --> 28:53.200
In regards to her father, Ms.
Wheeler said to Mr. Snyder,

28:53.267 --> 28:57.533
and I quote: That cheating
snake, I'm going to kill him.

28:57.533 --> 29:00.633
and I quote: That cheating
snake, I'm going to kill him.

29:05.067 --> 29:07.300
You cannot be serious.

29:07.367 --> 29:09.600
So are you saying you weren't
furious when you found out

29:09.667 --> 29:11.167
your father was
having an affair?

29:11.233 --> 29:13.900
Of course I was, who wouldn't
be? But I got over it.

29:13.967 --> 29:15.700
By killing your father.

29:15.767 --> 29:19.300
By going to therapy.
You people are unreal.

29:19.367 --> 29:21.100
There's also the
matter of your alibi.

29:21.167 --> 29:23.067
I spoke with
your spin teacher.

29:23.100 --> 29:26.067
The class you claimed you were
taking when your father was

29:26.067 --> 29:27.900
killed? She cancelled it.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.800
That wasn't a lie,
that was a half-truth.

29:30.867 --> 29:33.067
I didn't take the class,
but I was at the gym.

29:33.133 --> 29:34.633
My swipe card confirms that.

29:34.700 --> 29:37.367
Yes, it does, but since we know
that the class was cancelled,

29:37.433 --> 29:40.067
how do we know you
didn't skip back out?

29:40.133 --> 29:43.300
Because I was playing
racquetball with Jim Watanabe.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.167
My father's
biggest competitor.

29:45.233 --> 29:48.067
Our game was an
under-the-radar job interview.

29:48.133 --> 29:50.300
Oh, so you didn't want
anybody at the company to know

29:50.367 --> 29:51.100
that you were leaving.

29:51.167 --> 29:53.800
Exactly.

29:53.867 --> 29:56.333
I couldn't come in here every
day and look my father in the

29:56.400 --> 29:58.800
eye and pretend that I
didn't know he was a lying,

29:58.867 --> 30:01.667
duplicitous piece of scum.

30:01.733 --> 30:05.167
But that does not
mean I killed him.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.967
Come on!

30:19.033 --> 30:20.800
Dad, you need something?

30:20.867 --> 30:24.500
A bigger house?
Less occupants?

30:24.567 --> 30:26.167
I thought you and Mom said

30:26.233 --> 30:28.133
we need to be loving
and supportive.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.967
Did I mention anything
about, Do as I say,

30:30.033 --> 30:32.433
not as I do?

30:35.100 --> 30:37.167
Do you still
like Aunt Jackie?

30:37.233 --> 30:41.233
Of course I do. This is just
a challenging situation.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.667
Remember when we were little
and we all wanted to go to

30:43.733 --> 30:47.100
that midnight screening of Harry
Potter, and you and Mom and

30:47.167 --> 30:50.067
Uncle Tim all said it was
insane to go out that late?

30:50.133 --> 30:52.367
So Aunt Jackie took us, and
bought us the biggest popcorns

30:52.433 --> 30:55.267
and talked in this really bad
British accent the whole time.

30:55.333 --> 30:58.233
Yeah, that was cool of her.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.100
We're helping her because
that's what you do when

31:00.167 --> 31:02.167
someone you love
needs you, right?

31:06.067 --> 31:14.667
Yeah, you're right.
That's what we do.

31:14.733 --> 31:16.900
Jim Watanabe confirms that he
was playing racquetball with

31:16.967 --> 31:18.800
Maura at the
time of the murder.

31:18.867 --> 31:21.233
And we have footage of Kyle
at the protest in Portland,

31:21.300 --> 31:25.333
and a waitress at the
Four Seasons remembers Rick.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.500
All the Wheeler
children's alibis hold.

31:28.567 --> 31:32.300
Wait. What about the woman
Maura's PI discovered Andrew

31:32.367 --> 31:35.200
was having the affair with...
what's her name?

31:35.267 --> 31:36.200
Marilyn Gibbons.

31:36.267 --> 31:38.167
Yeah, from Yakima.

31:43.467 --> 31:45.367
There's a Marilyn
Gibbons in Yakima.

31:45.433 --> 31:47.833
Owns One More
Time antique furniture.

31:47.900 --> 31:50.467
We need to talk to her.

31:50.533 --> 31:55.400
Can't. Here's her obit. She
died three weeks ago.

31:55.467 --> 31:59.833
Oh, but what about that?

32:10.300 --> 32:14.567
Hey. Are you two looking
for something special?

32:14.633 --> 32:18.867
Yes, we are. We're looking
for Michael Gibbons.

32:18.933 --> 32:19.833
That's me.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.433
Was Marilyn
Gibbons your mother?

32:23.633 --> 32:25.400
She was.

32:25.467 --> 32:28.433
And Andrew Wheeler
was your father?

32:31.500 --> 32:33.900
Hey!

32:48.933 --> 32:51.867
Michael?
Stop!

33:41.267 --> 33:45.500
It's not fair.
This isn't fair!

33:45.567 --> 33:47.267
Let's go back to Crestview
and talk about that.

33:47.333 --> 33:47.767
Please don't!

33:52.900 --> 33:55.467
I'm willing to bet that cut
came from the glass you drove

33:55.533 --> 33:57.300
into Andrew Wheeler's chest.

33:59.467 --> 34:03.400
We have DNA that proves one
of Andrew's children killed him,

34:03.467 --> 34:06.767
and all his recognized
heirs have alibis.

34:06.833 --> 34:10.200
So if we swab your hand,
what's your DNA gonna tell us?

34:18.233 --> 34:20.067
Let's talk about your
relationship with your father.

34:20.133 --> 34:21.700
What relationship?

34:21.767 --> 34:23.100
How about your mother?

34:23.167 --> 34:26.233
Did she have a continuing
relationship with him?

34:26.300 --> 34:30.133
She never stopped
loving him for a minute.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.967
That's what she would tell me
when I asked her why we were

34:33.067 --> 34:38.400
living the way we did, hidden
away like we weren't worthy.

34:38.467 --> 34:41.267
She'd tell me about how he
came into the diner where she

34:41.333 --> 34:47.733
was working, how it was
like time stopped and...

34:47.800 --> 34:54.333
Twenty years, and she loved
him until the day that she died.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.867
She knew about
his other family,

34:57.933 --> 35:05.300
she just didn't care,
love is love I guess.

35:05.367 --> 35:07.133
But you cared, didn't you?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.933
How often did you
see your father?

35:13.067 --> 35:16.900
Twice a year,
if we were lucky.

35:16.967 --> 35:22.467
Not for holidays,
or my birthday.

35:22.533 --> 35:25.800
It was just when he was
in town on business.

35:25.867 --> 35:28.933
That must have hurt.

35:29.067 --> 35:35.067
It was inspiring.
I made a plan.

35:35.133 --> 35:40.067
I studied his company, and his
industry, and I decided I wanted

35:40.100 --> 35:42.800
to get a job where he worked
when I got out of college.

35:42.867 --> 35:46.300
Work my way up to the top,
until I was there next to him.

35:46.367 --> 35:47.933
Just like his other kids.

35:48.067 --> 35:50.267
So that's why you
met in the park?

35:50.333 --> 35:52.733
To talk about the future?

35:55.633 --> 36:01.867
He called me. Two days
after my mother's funeral.

36:01.933 --> 36:05.667
Said he wanted to talk
about something important.

36:05.733 --> 36:08.867
So he arranged the meeting?

36:10.367 --> 36:14.433
I thought, you know, I lost
my mom, and I get my dad now.

36:14.500 --> 36:18.367
He's going to give me a job.
and recognize me.

36:18.433 --> 36:20.233
But you didn't get a
job offer, did you?

36:20.300 --> 36:23.533
He wrote me a big,
fat check.

36:25.367 --> 36:27.733
He said, now that
your mother is gone,

36:27.800 --> 36:31.400
it's gonna be too painful
for me to stay in contact.

36:31.467 --> 36:33.233
I'm sorry, Michael.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.800
He thought he
could buy me off!

36:35.867 --> 36:39.533
That I would be grateful for
these scraps, like she was all

36:39.600 --> 36:48.500
those years. But I'm his son!
I'm worthy more than that.

36:48.567 --> 36:51.833
So I ripped up the check up,
and threw it in his face.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.400
What did he think of that?

36:53.467 --> 36:59.867
He said it was my loss. My loss.
He said he didn't love me!

37:02.267 --> 37:03.733
That had to hurt.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.200
I tried to follow him.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.633
I said that I wanted
to prove myself.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.867
And he said that was
never going to happen.

37:10.933 --> 37:12.867
He told me to
stop following him,

37:12.933 --> 37:15.333
and I yanked him back because
I wasn't done with him,

37:15.400 --> 37:16.933
I had more to say.

37:17.067 --> 37:18.800
And then somehow the
bottle was in my hand.

37:18.867 --> 37:20.600
And then the glass
was in his chest.

37:20.667 --> 37:24.567
And then it was all over.
I don't know, I don't know.

37:30.633 --> 37:35.733
Everything that I
thought I wanted.

37:35.800 --> 37:40.433
Gone.
All of it.

37:43.400 --> 37:47.767
So you faked the robbery
to cover your tracks?

37:47.833 --> 37:52.533
Grabbed his belongings and
tossed them a few blocks away?

37:52.600 --> 37:55.067
Yes.

37:55.100 --> 37:58.933
But not everything.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.100
Why was the medallion
still in your pocket

38:03.167 --> 38:13.767
when we picked
you up, Michael?

38:13.833 --> 38:18.167
I helped my
mom pick it out.

38:18.233 --> 38:24.433
For his birthday,
when I was ten.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.800
It's all I have, okay?

38:31.067 --> 38:34.100
And I also told the Montgomery's
they should probably tear

38:34.167 --> 38:35.933
this section here
down to a landing...

38:36.067 --> 38:39.833
Great use of space.
I can work up a bid quickly.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.633
I appreciate that.

38:42.700 --> 38:45.967
Hey, here she is. Jackie,
this is my buddy Ernie,

38:46.067 --> 38:49.167
the best landscape
architect in Crestview.

38:49.233 --> 38:51.233
Ernie, this is my
sister-in-law, Jackie.

38:51.300 --> 38:52.600
Nice to meet you.

38:52.667 --> 38:55.233
Matt tells me
you're job-hunting.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.933
Yeah, I am.

38:57.067 --> 38:58.633
I could use someone
to handle my phones,

38:58.700 --> 39:01.433
while my assistant's
on maternity leave.

39:01.500 --> 39:06.367
Would that be something you're
interested in talking about?

39:06.433 --> 39:08.700
It sure would, yes.

39:08.767 --> 39:10.067
Great!

39:10.133 --> 39:13.900
Come on, sit down.
You guys can chat for a sec.

39:26.933 --> 39:29.900
You okay?

39:31.067 --> 39:32.333
Yeah.

39:33.733 --> 39:35.633
It's just so sad.

39:35.700 --> 39:40.767
One decision after another after
another that destroys them.

39:40.833 --> 39:43.067
And they had all these
chances to make things right

39:43.067 --> 39:44.900
that they just ignored.

39:44.967 --> 39:48.067
Andrew Wheeler was apparently
a man used to doing things his

39:48.133 --> 39:52.200
way. Not necessarily
the right way.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.700
People take all kinds of
different paths

39:57.767 --> 39:59.800
to reach our
interrogation room.

39:59.867 --> 40:02.900
All that we can be responsible
for is making sure they tell

40:02.967 --> 40:07.000
the truth when
they're in there.

40:07.067 --> 40:13.033
The rest is on them.
On each of us.

40:13.100 --> 40:18.933
I know. Just some cases,
you know?

40:24.067 --> 40:29.033
Maura? What can
we do for you?

40:29.100 --> 40:30.900
This whole process has been
extremely difficult

40:30.967 --> 40:32.033
on my family.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.100
We understand.

40:33.167 --> 40:35.200
Still, we should
have behaved better.

40:35.267 --> 40:39.933
So I wanted to come and
thank you. In person.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.767
For finding the man
who murdered my father.

40:43.833 --> 40:48.467
He's...
my brother?

40:48.533 --> 40:50.767
Yes.

40:50.833 --> 40:56.467
Did he say...
why?

40:56.533 --> 40:59.600
He felt your
father didn't love him.

41:01.933 --> 41:04.233
That is the one thing all of
Andrew Wheeler's children

41:04.300 --> 41:07.900
have in common.

41:12.367 --> 41:14.600
So, I wanted to
talk to you guys.

41:14.667 --> 41:16.667
Do you remember that
conversation we had about what

41:16.733 --> 41:19.567
I learned in rehab?

41:19.633 --> 41:21.800
I don't think I expressed
myself completely and there

41:21.867 --> 41:23.767
was more I wanted to say.

41:23.833 --> 41:25.200
Mom. It's fine.
We get it.

41:25.267 --> 41:31.067
It's not fine. There was
more that I needed to say.

41:31.067 --> 41:34.933
I needed to say
that I love you.

41:35.067 --> 41:38.367
More than
you'll ever know.

41:38.433 --> 41:42.067
And I'm sorry
that I hurt you.

41:42.133 --> 41:45.200
I love you too, Mom.

41:48.367 --> 41:49.367
Sorry.

41:49.433 --> 41:51.567
No, it's okay.
We're good.

41:51.633 --> 41:53.500
And dinner's ready. So,
Cameron, do you want to...

41:53.567 --> 41:55.733
Dinner!

42:02.400 --> 42:06.067
Did Matt tell you that I met
with his friend Ernie,

42:06.067 --> 42:07.333
about a job?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.333
He said I might be a
good fit for his office.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.567
So he's gonna let me know
in a couple of days.

42:11.633 --> 42:12.833
That's awesome, Mom.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.933
Hey, I might not get it,
but every interview

42:15.067 --> 42:16.467
is one step closer, right?

42:16.533 --> 42:19.733
Cheers to that.
