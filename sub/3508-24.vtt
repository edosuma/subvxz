00:01.373 --> 00:02.352
There are two kinds of folks

00:02.379 --> 00:03.979
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:04.313 --> 00:06.039
Psychopaths and mystery writers.

00:06.277 --> 00:07.299
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.300
Who am I?

00:08.389 --> 00:09.528
I'm Rick Castle.

00:09.529 --> 00:09.929
Castle.

00:09.963 --> 00:10.623
Castle.

00:10.624 --> 00:12.624
I really am ruggedly
handsome, aren't I?

00:12.770 --> 00:14.960
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:15.170 --> 00:15.989
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:16.024 --> 00:17.044
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:17.079 --> 00:18.985
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:19.031 --> 00:20.517
And thanks to my
friendship with the mayor,

00:20.518 --> 00:21.518
I get to be on her case.

00:21.552 --> 00:23.495
I would be happy to
let you spank me.

00:23.530 --> 00:24.406
And together, we catch killers

00:25.354 --> 00:26.342
we make a pretty good team,
you know?

00:26.343 --> 00:27.343
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:27.477 --> 00:28.171
Turner and Hooch.

00:28.534 --> 00:29.601
You do remind me a little of Hooch.

00:47.265 --> 00:49.728
Designate 2-2-3.
I am blown. I am blown.

00:49.977 --> 00:51.614
This call is unauthorized, 2-2-3.

00:51.615 --> 00:53.819
This line is not secure.
Where is the safe house?

00:53.820 --> 00:56.091
Negative, 2-2-3.
You know the rules.

01:21.550 --> 01:23.882
<i>We've got something between us</i>
<i>nothing can change.</i>

01:23.883 --> 01:26.825
<i>Oh, well, I suppose you're right in a way,
Walter.</i>

01:26.945 --> 01:28.619
<i>Sure, I'm right... Aren't you
gonna answer that?</i>

01:28.739 --> 01:29.739
Nope.

01:29.859 --> 01:31.572
Oh-- and neither are you.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.142
Ahh. Who are you hiding from now?

01:34.397 --> 01:36.189
Gina.

01:36.309 --> 01:38.141
Ohh. Forget an alimony payment?

01:38.385 --> 01:40.071
No, this time she's not
calling as my ex-wife.

01:40.072 --> 01:41.487
She's calling as my publisher.

01:41.607 --> 01:44.110
The first draft of my new
manuscript was due yesterday,

01:44.111 --> 01:45.526
and I haven't finished.

01:45.646 --> 01:47.580
Why not? Haven't felt like writing.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.274
And besides, I don't
think I'm entirely happy

01:49.394 --> 01:51.011
with where my characters are going.

01:51.284 --> 01:53.351
Well... change them.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.063
Working on it.
What are you doing here?

01:56.183 --> 01:57.685
I thought you had an audition
for williamstown tonight.

01:57.805 --> 01:59.904
I do. Just came to pick
up my lucky blouse.

02:00.024 --> 02:01.971
Aah! I got in! I got in!

02:02.091 --> 02:03.248
Oh, good.

02:03.368 --> 02:05.688
Oh, my God. You got in.
That's amazing! I can't b--

02:05.808 --> 02:07.095
I don't--what-
what did you get into?

02:07.215 --> 02:09.122
Princeton's summer program
for High School students.

02:09.495 --> 02:11.216
I thought you got wait-listed.
Someone just canceled,

02:11.217 --> 02:12.911
but we have to send
them a deposit A.S.A.P.,

02:13.031 --> 02:15.496
because it starts this weekend.
This weekend?

02:15.812 --> 02:17.938
I know we had plans,
but-- not just plans--

02:18.058 --> 02:20.245
Memorial Day, the Hamptons,

02:20.365 --> 02:22.266
our annual "kick off
the summer" week.

02:22.386 --> 02:24.534
I mean, I got the
illegal fireworks,

02:24.535 --> 02:26.855
the kind you like, the ones
with the silver starbursts.

02:27.185 --> 02:28.588
Dad, it's Princeton.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.345
I can't believe you would
blow off illegal fireworks

02:30.465 --> 02:32.269
for a lousy head start
at a top-notch education.

02:32.389 --> 02:33.906
I know. I'm a huge disappointment.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.825
Now there are a bunch of
forms you need to sign,

02:35.945 --> 02:37.029
and I'll fill the rest
out for you later.

02:37.149 --> 02:39.151
Mm-hmm. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

02:40.070 --> 02:42.065
It says here that the,
uh, the dorms are coed.

02:42.307 --> 02:44.860
Yeah, it's college. No.

02:44.861 --> 02:47.563
No, it's a summer program
for High School students

02:47.564 --> 02:49.066
<i>at</i> a college.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.372
According to this,
half the kids in your building

02:51.492 --> 02:53.057
will be 16- and 17-year-old boys.

02:53.177 --> 02:56.474
<i>Relax,</i> dad. Each floor has a
resident advisor who's 21.

02:57.045 --> 02:58.946
Oh, so the one person in charge

02:58.947 --> 03:00.916
is conveniently old
enough to buy alcohol?

03:01.036 --> 03:02.971
Darling, don't be such a prude.

03:03.215 --> 03:05.564
Remember that trip you took
to Italy with your class?

03:05.684 --> 03:07.322
You were younger
than Alexis is now.

03:07.442 --> 03:10.165
Mother, if you had any idea
what happened on that trip,

03:10.285 --> 03:12.491
you would've never let
me leave the house again.

03:13.578 --> 03:16.158
Sometimes, the less you know,
the better.

03:18.562 --> 03:20.263
Ah.

03:21.499 --> 03:22.684
Beckett.

03:22.804 --> 03:24.227
You have a novel to finish.

03:24.347 --> 03:25.417
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

03:25.537 --> 03:27.037
It's Castle.

03:28.511 --> 03:29.803
It's kinda like a tradition--

03:29.923 --> 03:32.177
you know, bonfires,
roasting marshmallows,

03:32.178 --> 03:33.812
telling ghost stories,
sleeping late.

03:34.128 --> 03:35.757
We've done it since she was 5.

03:36.231 --> 03:38.768
Sounds nice.
Kinda magical, actually.

03:39.153 --> 03:41.087
Yeah, you know what?
You should come.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.138
Oh, it's right on the ocean.
There's a secluded pool.

03:43.258 --> 03:44.920
You could lay out,
work on your tan.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.271
Wow, Castle,
you're working really hard

03:47.391 --> 03:48.913
to see me in a swimsuit.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.746
If you are not comfortable
in a swimsuit,

03:50.866 --> 03:53.701
you can just skinny-dip.

03:53.702 --> 03:55.186
The vic's a white male,

03:55.306 --> 03:57.159
multiple gunshot
wounds to the chest.

03:57.461 --> 03:58.906
Found him about an hour ago.

03:59.026 --> 04:00.089
Mugging?

04:00.209 --> 04:02.481
Nah. He still has his watch,
wallet and cash.

04:02.601 --> 04:04.703
Then there's the matter
of the phantom bullets.

04:04.823 --> 04:06.297
Yeah, he took five to the chest.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.125
There are no slugs, Shell casings.

04:08.245 --> 04:10.841
The killer went so far as to dig his bullets
out of that tree branch right there.

04:10.961 --> 04:12.989
That's weird.
What about in the body?

04:12.990 --> 04:14.313
They're all through and throughs.

04:14.433 --> 04:15.909
Exit holes on each wound.

04:16.029 --> 04:18.243
So our doer cleaned
up after himself.

04:18.363 --> 04:20.262
It takes <i>real</i> presence of mind

04:20.264 --> 04:22.199
to put five bullets
into a man's chest

04:22.200 --> 04:23.730
and then keep your cool long enough

04:23.850 --> 04:26.816
to pick up after yourself.
Natural instinct is to run.

04:27.172 --> 04:29.218
I would say we are most
likely dealing with

04:29.490 --> 04:30.845
a highly trained assassin.

04:31.873 --> 04:32.878
Time of death?

04:32.998 --> 04:34.419
Based on temperature and lividity,

04:34.539 --> 04:36.942
I'd say between 11:00 P.
M. and 1:00 A.M.

04:37.062 --> 04:37.963
I.D.?

04:38.083 --> 04:40.285
Shawn Caldwell.
No driver's license,

04:40.405 --> 04:42.047
but according to his work I.D.,

04:42.291 --> 04:44.448
he was a consultant for F.
G.S. In Midtown.

04:44.692 --> 04:46.467
"Fastwater Global Services"?

04:46.587 --> 04:48.074
Sounds like a CIA front.

04:48.677 --> 04:49.918
Found these in his pocket.

04:50.842 --> 04:52.163
Company car keys.

04:52.283 --> 04:53.983
There's no house keys on the chain.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.538
There's a generic hotel key card.

04:57.658 --> 04:59.910
In from out of town?
Except the company address is local,

05:00.498 --> 05:02.021
and so is his gym membership.
All right.

05:02.141 --> 05:04.177
Have C.S.U. Sweep the area,
canvass the homeless people,

05:04.297 --> 05:06.369
see if anyone saw
or heard anything.

05:19.878 --> 05:22.080
Ocean view from my patio.

05:22.081 --> 05:24.683
It <i>does not</i> get better than this.

05:26.185 --> 05:28.888
What's wrong? I tried
information, our database.

05:28.889 --> 05:30.857
I even did an Internet search,

05:30.858 --> 05:32.072
and it's like these
guys don't even exist.

05:32.192 --> 05:34.120
Who? Fastwater global services.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.262
Ah! See? I told you. CIA cover.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.126
No. I mean, they probably
just don't like to advertise.

05:39.246 --> 05:40.840
Yeah, well, I thought so as well,

05:40.960 --> 05:44.035
so I checked their address-
1747 West 43rd Street.

05:44.699 --> 05:46.468
It's in the middle
of the Hudson River.

05:47.364 --> 05:49.848
So I went back and checked
through his wallet

05:49.968 --> 05:51.780
and looked at his I.D.
S, his gym membership,

05:51.900 --> 05:53.883
health insurance,
even his atm card--

05:54.264 --> 05:56.345
they're all fakes.
You run his name?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.842
Yeah, there's about half
a dozen Shawn Caldwells

05:58.843 --> 06:00.505
in the tristate area,
and none of them are a match.

06:00.864 --> 06:02.958
What about his fingerprints?
Not in our system.

06:03.618 --> 06:05.495
Hey, Beckett. Hey, what'd you find?

06:05.615 --> 06:07.551
Well, we spoke to some
homeless guys who were camped

06:07.671 --> 06:09.124
a couple hundred yards from
the overpass last night.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.919
They didn't see or hear anything.

06:11.039 --> 06:13.316
Couple hundred yards?
How do you not hear five gunshots?

06:13.436 --> 06:15.319
Unless... He used a silencer.

06:15.439 --> 06:17.526
To kill a man who went out of
the way to hide who he was?

06:17.646 --> 06:19.965
This is starting to sound more
and more like a professional hit.

06:20.085 --> 06:21.354
Yeah, well, we're nowhere
until we figure out

06:21.474 --> 06:22.368
who this guy actually is.

06:22.488 --> 06:23.885
Why don't you guys
go canvass the area

06:24.005 --> 06:26.083
near the entrance to the park,
see if you can find his car?

06:26.428 --> 06:28.305
And fax his photo
to the local hotels,

06:28.425 --> 06:31.395
see if anyone recognizes
his face. Right on.

06:33.941 --> 06:35.554
You know, I-I was...

06:35.674 --> 06:37.334
I was kidding about
the assassin stuff.

06:40.077 --> 06:41.692
That's Lanie.

06:42.109 --> 06:43.803
Please tell me that
you found something.

06:43.923 --> 06:45.826
Well, I found nothing
that sheds light

06:45.946 --> 06:47.178
on the identity of your victim,

06:47.298 --> 06:49.398
but I did find something that
may help with your killer.

06:49.518 --> 06:51.716
We know the shooter tried
to scrub the crime scene

06:51.836 --> 06:53.747
of ballistic evidence,
but one of the rounds

06:53.867 --> 06:56.906
shattered Mr. Caldwell's rib
and left this little souvenir.

06:58.973 --> 07:00.988
A bullet fragment?
Can't tell the caliber,

07:01.108 --> 07:03.018
but this polygonal rifling
along the outer rim

07:03.138 --> 07:05.403
is consistent with the
barrel of a glock. Hmm.

07:05.647 --> 07:08.335
What? The grouping of the shots.

07:08.336 --> 07:10.372
You see how tight they all are?

07:10.373 --> 07:12.842
There's no stippling,
no muzzle burns.

07:13.127 --> 07:15.077
The killer must have
shot from a distance.

07:15.078 --> 07:17.078
Which means he's a very good shot.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.115
Hi.

07:21.116 --> 07:23.089
Great. Thanks.

07:23.548 --> 07:25.185
They found the car.

07:25.186 --> 07:27.020
Car is registered to
Allied Fleet Services,

07:27.021 --> 07:28.488
a car rental agency.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.485
Oh, I hope they got
the insurance option.

07:30.605 --> 07:31.921
Who did they rent it to?

07:32.041 --> 07:35.039
This particular car is on a
long-term lease to F.G.S.

07:35.682 --> 07:37.419
Fastwater Global Services.

07:37.539 --> 07:39.749
Do they know they rented their car
to a company that doesn't exist?

07:39.869 --> 07:41.707
Oh, no. It exists,
just not in New York.

07:41.827 --> 07:43.780
All correspondence,
billing and payments go through

07:43.900 --> 07:46.306
a P.O. Box in the Cayman Islands.
It gets even weirder.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.196
In the trunk, we found these.

07:49.446 --> 07:50.674
Euros.

07:50.675 --> 07:52.228
5,000 of 'em, and...

07:56.246 --> 07:57.998
That looks military. Yeah.

07:58.118 --> 07:59.793
What's in the box?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.916
A fancy pen. Nice!

08:02.036 --> 08:03.931
A bag full of Euros,
a high-tech heater

08:04.051 --> 08:06.101
and a silent killer
who leaves no trace...

08:06.221 --> 08:08.741
<i>Good evening, 2-2-3. Informant has
been identified.</i>

08:08.861 --> 08:11.679
<i>Ally contact will meet you at Café Moulin,
1315 hours... I didn't--I
didn't--</i>

08:11.799 --> 08:14.793

08:14.794 --> 08:16.862

<i>Response, "no, Steve is my brother.

08:20.797 --> 08:22.298
Whoa!

08:22.299 --> 08:24.898
Yeow. Ow!

08:24.899 --> 08:26.993
Well, now we know why our
victim doesn't exist.

08:27.911 --> 08:30.222
He's a spy.

We contacted the CIA, the FBI,

08:41.707 --> 08:44.442
So far, all of them are denying
that he was one of theirs.

08:44.443 --> 08:45.859
Well, of course
they're gonna deny it.

08:45.979 --> 08:48.142
He was probably disavowed
the moment he was killed,

08:48.500 --> 08:50.658
making this officially
the coolest case ever.

08:50.778 --> 08:52.742
So what do you want us to do, sir?

08:52.862 --> 08:55.682
Your job. Till someone more
important tells us different,

08:55.802 --> 08:57.907
treat this like a
standard homicide case.

08:58.316 --> 09:00.885
You go to the café.
If this contact of his is an ally,

09:01.005 --> 09:02.261
they may be willing to talk.

09:02.381 --> 09:04.930
How are we gonna
identify the... contact?

09:05.289 --> 09:07.343
Same way our victim was going to.

09:24.445 --> 09:26.670
Bingo.

09:27.043 --> 09:28.536
Her?

09:28.656 --> 09:30.460
She's the only one here alone.

09:34.945 --> 09:36.997
Aren't you Steve's friend?

09:37.322 --> 09:38.714
<i>Pardon?</i>

09:38.834 --> 09:40.556
Aren't you Steve's friend?

09:40.676 --> 09:43.599
Steve? No, no, I'm sorry.
I don't know Steve.

09:47.692 --> 09:49.935
Are you sure?

09:50.251 --> 09:51.552
So he's not your brother?

09:51.672 --> 09:53.553
Go away. Okay.

09:55.275 --> 09:57.171
Wasn't her. Yeah, I gathered.

09:58.317 --> 10:00.785
This all feel a little
odd to you? What?

10:00.905 --> 10:03.432
The old cloak-and-dagger,
secret meetings, code words--

10:04.336 --> 10:06.771
it all feels a
little old-fashioned.

10:06.891 --> 10:08.525
I mean, why meet face-to-face

10:08.645 --> 10:10.346
when you can just send
an encrypted e-mail?

10:10.466 --> 10:13.619
Sometimes, you just have
to do things off the grid.

10:14.265 --> 10:17.402
Speaking of off the grid,
I was serious about this weekend.

10:19.612 --> 10:21.988
You're seriously asking me to
your place in the Hamptons?

10:22.108 --> 10:25.239
I promise, no funny stuff.
Just a friendly getaway.

10:25.359 --> 10:26.567
It'd be fun.

10:26.687 --> 10:28.759
Yeah... no.

10:29.089 --> 10:32.026
Y-you know, some of us
have to work for a living.

10:32.146 --> 10:35.806
On Memorial Day? Yes.
I spent all of my vacation days

10:35.926 --> 10:38.749
looking for a new place to live.
Shh, shh, shh.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.778
Aren't you Steve's friend?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.838
No. Steve's my brother.

10:52.579 --> 10:55.120
Brauer. Hans Brauer.

10:55.637 --> 10:57.976
Shawn Caldwell.
We don't have much time.

10:58.096 --> 10:59.762
The target's in country,
but on the move.

10:59.882 --> 11:01.817
Go to Alpha location
and look for the sign,

11:01.937 --> 11:04.449
but Blackbird wants you to know,
there are other assets in play.

11:04.569 --> 11:06.670
So if they move on you,
go to ground.

11:07.029 --> 11:09.436
But if you get a shot, take it.
Understood?

11:10.927 --> 11:12.660
Understood.

11:12.661 --> 11:14.084
Uh...

11:14.204 --> 11:15.494
Wait.

11:15.969 --> 11:18.639
My people need confirmation
on the target's name.

11:18.898 --> 11:20.687
What did you say?
The target's name,

11:20.807 --> 11:22.849
my people need confirmation.

11:22.969 --> 11:25.274
Ah!

11:25.394 --> 11:26.366
Who are you? Uh--

11:26.486 --> 11:28.232
NYPD!

11:28.352 --> 11:30.098
Hands up.

11:30.629 --> 11:32.093
Not you, Castle.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.680
Right.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.939
You people have no idea
what you just stepped into.

11:40.454 --> 11:42.056
No idea.

11:42.472 --> 11:43.942
Why don't you tell us?

11:44.062 --> 11:45.478
Because you don't want to know.

11:45.598 --> 11:47.358
The things that I've seen?

11:47.746 --> 11:49.268
Trust me...

11:49.388 --> 11:51.706
Ignorance is bliss.

11:52.562 --> 11:54.413
Who do you work for,
the government?

11:58.166 --> 11:59.785
Well, if not the government,
then who?

12:00.656 --> 12:02.149
What happened to the real Caldwell?

12:02.269 --> 12:03.943
Dead. When?

12:04.308 --> 12:05.849
Last night.

12:06.443 --> 12:08.001
That means they know.

12:08.378 --> 12:10.416
They know about what?

12:11.033 --> 12:12.340
About the target?

12:12.460 --> 12:14.110
About how you were going
to take your shot?

12:14.230 --> 12:16.079
Who's your target, Hans?

12:17.254 --> 12:19.048
I spent three weeks in Afghanistan

12:19.168 --> 12:20.943
with fire ants crawling
on my privates.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.317
Somehow I don't think your
polite-but-stern routine

12:23.437 --> 12:25.599
is gonna get you very far.

12:30.578 --> 12:32.645
You can ask me whatever you want.

12:32.889 --> 12:34.764
But let me tell you
what's gonna happen here.

12:35.008 --> 12:37.588
In just a little while,
you will receive a phone call

12:37.708 --> 12:39.629
from someone much more
important than you.

12:40.364 --> 12:42.316
Then they will tell you that
there's been a misunderstanding,

12:42.436 --> 12:44.590
and you will be
instructed to release me.

12:44.877 --> 12:47.060
You will do so grudgingly,

12:47.649 --> 12:49.506
but you will do so nonetheless.

12:49.808 --> 12:53.005
And you will watch me walk
out of here into the night...

12:54.049 --> 12:56.072
Never to be seen again.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.386
What the hell are we into here?

13:06.506 --> 13:08.248
Hopefully the Feds
will have more luck.

13:08.368 --> 13:09.411
Somehow I doubt it.

13:09.531 --> 13:11.093
At least not in time to
stop whatever he's planning.

13:11.213 --> 13:12.880
Yo, Beckett.

13:13.639 --> 13:15.605
That was the manager of
the Carter Regency Hotel,

13:15.725 --> 13:17.137
says he recognized our vic.

13:17.257 --> 13:19.471
Guy checked in two days
ago and never checked out.

13:23.442 --> 13:25.189
Clear. Castle, check the bureau.

13:27.778 --> 13:28.863
The safe is locked.

13:28.983 --> 13:31.711
Open it.

13:32.249 --> 13:34.391
Whatever he was supposed to do,
it was going down today.

13:34.511 --> 13:36.131
He was scheduled to
check out tomorrow.

13:37.426 --> 13:39.255
It's more I.D.s

13:39.256 --> 13:41.690
John Mason... Paul Chenausky.

13:41.691 --> 13:43.791
Probably fake, too.

13:52.336 --> 13:54.303
Castle.

13:55.814 --> 13:57.804
What is it?

13:58.756 --> 14:00.636
It's a security dossier.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.617
Kofi Amandul.

14:02.737 --> 14:03.934
Who's Kofi Amandul?

14:04.054 --> 14:06.198
The minister of banking for
the Republic of Luvania.

14:07.961 --> 14:09.684
These were taken in
front of the U.N.

14:09.804 --> 14:10.864
This is the target.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.773
This is who they're trying to kill.

14:13.611 --> 14:15.262
I have to call the
state department.

14:15.382 --> 14:17.008
I don't think you have to.

14:17.309 --> 14:19.481
While writing Derrick Storm,
I became somewhat of an expert

14:19.601 --> 14:20.572
on world geography.

14:20.692 --> 14:22.036
You ever heard of the
Republic of Luvania? No.

14:22.156 --> 14:24.892
Yeah, neither have I. You know why?

14:24.893 --> 14:27.094
Because it doesn't exist.

14:27.095 --> 14:28.952
I got a feeling Kofi Amandul
doesn't exist either.

14:29.072 --> 14:31.307
Then why would they try to
kill someone who doesn't exist?

14:32.725 --> 14:34.800
I think I know.

14:34.801 --> 14:36.268
Come on.

14:39.339 --> 14:40.805
Hey. So I just got
back from ballistics.

14:40.925 --> 14:42.930
That gun that we found
in the victim's car...

14:43.050 --> 14:45.335
Let me guess, it's not real...

14:45.455 --> 14:48.141
Because it's a game.
What are you talking about?

14:48.261 --> 14:49.808
This whole thing-- the fake I.D.s,

14:49.928 --> 14:51.731
the dossiers, Luvania,
the banking minister--

14:51.851 --> 14:53.560
it's all part of a game.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.707
Hey, come on. You're breaking
the fourth wall here.

14:55.827 --> 14:58.359
Listen, Hans, or whatever your name is,
you see that woman?

14:58.479 --> 15:00.910
She's a real cop.
There's been a real murder,

15:01.168 --> 15:02.882
and you are really under arrest.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.796
If you don't start talking to us,
you're gonna stay in jail...

15:07.075 --> 15:08.634
Real jail.

15:09.698 --> 15:11.152
You're telling me this is real?

15:11.272 --> 15:12.469
Very.

15:12.589 --> 15:13.431
I'm really in jail?

15:13.551 --> 15:15.646
Yes, you are really in jail.

15:17.799 --> 15:20.683
No, no, see--see I-I-
I thought that...

15:22.035 --> 15:24.109
This isn't part of the experience?

15:25.134 --> 15:26.533
What experience?

15:28.121 --> 15:29.501
The company is called Spy-Ventures.

15:29.621 --> 15:32.180
They specialize in high-end
spy-cations for thrill seekers.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.142
Spy-cations?

15:33.262 --> 15:34.883
Yeah, you want to be
kidnapped and interrogated?

15:35.003 --> 15:36.604
They got a package.
You want to be a super spy?

15:36.724 --> 15:38.848
They got a package.
Their motto is "authenticity."

15:38.968 --> 15:40.816
Right down to the
offshore accounts,

15:40.936 --> 15:42.903
false identifications
and realistic weaponry.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.765
All right. Find out who
the hell's in charge.

15:45.766 --> 15:48.302
Let's see if "authenticity"
includes murder.

15:53.267 --> 15:56.901
Are you still hiding from Gina?

15:56.902 --> 15:58.759
She's persistent,
I'll give her that.

15:58.879 --> 16:00.585
You can't outrun her
forever, darling.

16:00.705 --> 16:02.806
Why don't I just
talk to her? No! No!

16:03.064 --> 16:05.109
No, no, no.

16:05.511 --> 16:06.669
All right.

16:06.789 --> 16:10.038
Ahh. Does the reemergence
of summer hats

16:10.158 --> 16:11.894
mean you'll be making an
appearance in the Hamptons?

16:12.138 --> 16:14.593
Alas, you're going to have
to stagger along without me.

16:14.713 --> 16:16.453
I got... the part!

16:16.573 --> 16:17.752
Fantastic! Ah!

16:17.753 --> 16:19.754
Oh-ho, I'm so proud!
Thank you, thank you.

16:19.755 --> 16:21.689
It's not the biggest
role in the world,

16:21.690 --> 16:23.824
but I do love summer stock.

16:23.825 --> 16:25.517
You gonna be okay?

16:25.948 --> 16:26.790
Why wouldn't I be?

16:26.910 --> 16:29.459
I'm gonna be gone through August,
Alexis is away, and...

16:29.718 --> 16:32.259
I'll be fine. I'll,
uh... I'll finish the book.

16:32.379 --> 16:34.198
Good. What about Chet?
He'll be all alone.

16:34.199 --> 16:36.333
It's good for him to miss me.
I don't want him to assume...

16:36.334 --> 16:38.834
that I'm gonna always
just be around.

16:38.835 --> 16:40.735
Sweet place.

16:40.736 --> 16:43.870
Oh! Everyone's here.

16:47.247 --> 16:48.900
You were expecting to be alone?

16:49.020 --> 16:51.547
No, you're just home early.
This is Carter.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.644
He's going to the Princeton
program, too. Hey.

16:54.339 --> 16:57.223
Is he now? Lovely
to meet you, Carter.

16:57.343 --> 16:58.491
Nice to meet you.

16:58.611 --> 17:00.683
Um... I'll meet you in the kitchen.

17:00.803 --> 17:02.123
Oh. Yeah.

17:02.243 --> 17:03.856
I friended him on the program page

17:03.976 --> 17:06.219
and found out he lived nearby,
so we decided to hook up.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.196
We just thought it'd be nice
to go there knowing someone,

17:10.317 --> 17:13.096
and our rooms are right
across from each other.

17:14.259 --> 17:17.386
Hey, sorry about that...

17:17.506 --> 17:18.935
How old would you say that kid is?

17:19.056 --> 17:21.229
Old enough to do all the things
you did when you were his age.

17:21.230 --> 17:23.166
You are <i>so</i> funny.

17:23.699 --> 17:25.112
That's what I'm afraid of.

17:25.232 --> 17:27.057
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.
James Patterson called.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.062
He's gonna be a little late
for the poker game tomorrow.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.438
Probably wants to use the
time to write another book.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.515
Good thing your Captain's not here.

17:37.516 --> 17:40.296
This might be construed as
inappropriate office behavior.

17:41.631 --> 17:43.511
I'll see you later.

17:43.631 --> 17:45.133
Yeah.

17:48.399 --> 17:50.001
Didn't mean to break up your party.

17:50.121 --> 17:51.996
No, no party. I was
actually waiting for you.

17:51.997 --> 17:54.242
We finally got ahold of
someone from Spy-Ventures.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.145
The owners are meeting
us at their offices.

17:56.590 --> 17:58.033
Oh, yeah, and your ex-wife called.

17:58.034 --> 17:59.443
She said that you've been
avoiding her because you're late

17:59.563 --> 18:01.180
delivering your manuscript of...

18:01.912 --> 18:03.286
"Naked Heat."

18:03.776 --> 18:06.307
That's a catchy title.
When were you gonna tell me?

18:06.651 --> 18:08.409
Well, I was waiting
for the perfect time.

18:08.529 --> 18:09.709
It just never happened.

18:09.829 --> 18:11.251
She's naked on the
cover again, isn't she?

18:11.371 --> 18:12.732
Kinda, yeah. That's great.

18:12.852 --> 18:14.212
No one's gonna make fun of me.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.282
Good.

18:16.774 --> 18:18.385
That's Roger Farraday.

18:18.386 --> 18:20.320
He was on the 4-day
covert ops package,

18:20.321 --> 18:21.822
culminating in a
staged assassination

18:21.823 --> 18:24.675
of a U.N. Diplomat.
Stamford, Connecticut.

18:24.795 --> 18:27.773
He lists his wife Melinda
as his emergency contact.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.846
Detective. We're--we're very
sorry about the confusion.

18:30.966 --> 18:32.598
We called as soon as
we got your messages.

18:32.599 --> 18:34.541
So the fake I.D.
s, the Cayman Islands--

18:34.661 --> 18:36.400
yeah, they're all part
of the experience.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.560
You have no idea how excited
people get when they have to

18:38.680 --> 18:40.365
wire their payment to
an offshore account.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.535
So your slogan is "authenticity."

18:42.655 --> 18:44.763
Is it possible one of your other
players took things too far?

18:44.883 --> 18:47.707
Mr. Castle, uh, we take
the safety of our guests

18:47.827 --> 18:48.803
very seriously.

18:48.923 --> 18:51.409
Our weapons look real,
but their legal, inoperable

18:51.529 --> 18:52.572
and rigged for game play.

18:52.692 --> 18:54.434
So if one of the
guests killed Roger,

18:54.554 --> 18:56.343
they used their own weapon,
not ours.

18:56.463 --> 18:58.295
So the weapons are fake,
but the money is real?

18:58.415 --> 18:59.555
What money?

18:59.675 --> 19:01.286
The 5,000 Euros we
found in the car.

19:03.144 --> 19:05.737
Uh... yeah, we-
-we do money drops sometimes,

19:05.857 --> 19:07.128
but never with real currency.

19:07.248 --> 19:08.898
That's more than he
paid for his package.

19:09.018 --> 19:10.689
Are you sure it was real? Positive.

19:11.177 --> 19:13.629
What was Mr. Farraday doing
in the park that night?

19:13.749 --> 19:15.636
Was that a part of a mission?
No, no, no.

19:15.637 --> 19:17.571
The park is too dangerous
to work at night.

19:17.572 --> 19:19.878
And his last mission should've
ended hours earlier.

19:19.998 --> 19:21.966
What was his last mission?

19:22.497 --> 19:24.534
Farraday? Yeah. I was his handler.

19:24.821 --> 19:27.442
His last mission that day
was the bus locker drop.

19:27.562 --> 19:29.101
I checked it at 10:00.
It was empty.

19:29.221 --> 19:30.594
So we know he picked up the pen.

19:30.714 --> 19:31.781
The one with the recording? Yeah.

19:32.342 --> 19:34.883
His next activity was
the café meet yesterday.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.580
So where did he go between
10:00 and midnight?

19:37.700 --> 19:38.866
And how did he end up in the park

19:38.986 --> 19:40.422
with 5,000 Euros in his car?

19:40.542 --> 19:42.399
Wasn't his last drop
an accomplice mission?

19:42.519 --> 19:43.785
An accomplice mission?

19:43.905 --> 19:46.083
Well, sometimes we have
players do tasks together,

19:46.203 --> 19:48.163
not knowing if the
other is friend or foe.

19:48.283 --> 19:51.015
He was paired with designate 145,
french intelligence.

19:51.135 --> 19:53.263
Andrea Fisher. If she was with him,

19:53.383 --> 19:54.867
maybe she knows where he went next.

19:56.217 --> 19:57.898
Recognize her?

19:58.559 --> 20:00.464
<i>Mais oui.</i>

20:00.780 --> 20:03.188
Oh, God. You both must
think I'm so stupid,

20:03.308 --> 20:04.629
the way that I acted in the café.
All part of the game.

20:05.941 --> 20:07.276
It's a vacation from yourself.
That's what they say.

20:08.494 --> 20:10.513
I mean, don't get me wrong.
You know, I-I love my husband

20:10.633 --> 20:11.877
and my kids, but--

20:11.997 --> 20:14.480
but every time I go away,
I'm-- I'm still a mom and a wife.

20:14.997 --> 20:17.397
My husband said, "
if you can pay for it, you can go."

20:18.000 --> 20:19.770
So it took a lot
of coupon clipping,

20:19.890 --> 20:22.207
but I got to be a spy.

20:22.508 --> 20:24.541
Our victim... how
well did you know him?

20:24.886 --> 20:27.363
We... had a couple
of tasks together,

20:27.483 --> 20:29.837
but--but we were
always playing roles.

20:30.339 --> 20:32.752
You were with Mr. Farraday when
he did the bus station drop?

20:33.054 --> 20:35.593
Yeah. Yeah, we, uh,
we cracked the code, and, um,

20:35.713 --> 20:37.366
we went to-- to get our packages.

20:37.624 --> 20:38.662
Do you know where he went next?

20:38.782 --> 20:39.954
To deliver the briefcase.

20:40.267 --> 20:42.365
Briefcase? What briefcase?

20:42.767 --> 20:44.093
It was in the locker.

20:44.213 --> 20:46.610
I-I didn't get one,
so I assumed it was a bonus mission.

20:46.730 --> 20:48.137
Do you know what was
in the briefcase?

20:48.257 --> 20:49.731
I-I don't know.
You have to ask them.

20:49.851 --> 20:52.156
That was Jason from Spy-Ventures.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.007
The only thing that was
supposed to be in that locker

20:54.127 --> 20:56.101
was a pen set,
which he put in there himself.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.352
He has no idea where
that briefcase came from.

20:58.472 --> 21:00.440
If the money and the briefcase
weren't connected to the game,

21:00.560 --> 21:02.659
maybe they're connected
to each other. Hey.

21:02.989 --> 21:04.808
Victim's wife and
business partner--

21:04.928 --> 21:06.791
they just I.D.'ed the body.

21:07.471 --> 21:09.127
Can you check the lockers
at the bus depot,

21:09.247 --> 21:11.180
see if they're covered
by cameras? Yeah, sure.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.955
Please take a seat.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.593
I don't want to sit down.
They said it was safe.

21:17.713 --> 21:19.494
They said it was all pretend.

21:19.614 --> 21:23.032
We can't be sure that
your husband's death

21:23.391 --> 21:24.597
had anything to do with the game, Mrs.
Farraday. Can you think of a reason

21:24.717 --> 21:26.645
someone would want to harm Roger?

21:29.788 --> 21:32.357
Roger was one of those guys
everybody instantly liked.

21:32.477 --> 21:34.151
Uh, that's why he was
so good at his job.

21:34.587 --> 21:37.282
We owned a dealership together,
just outside Stamford.

21:37.770 --> 21:40.024
Can't sell cars if
people don't like you.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.190
Who else knew that he was
gonna be in the city?

21:44.822 --> 21:46.482
Just Lee and I.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.339
Eight years, Detective.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.625
We were married for eight years.

21:53.630 --> 21:55.560
And now he's dead?

21:55.680 --> 21:56.875
You know, it used to be

21:56.876 --> 21:58.443
if you were gonna
have a midlife crisis,

21:58.563 --> 22:01.799
you'd just buy a Ferrari,
get a new girlfriend,

22:01.919 --> 22:03.143
even jump out of a plane.

22:03.263 --> 22:04.916
Shot in the park,
money in his car--

22:04.917 --> 22:07.741
makes you wonder what else
he did to get his jollies.

22:07.861 --> 22:09.157
Now that we know who he really is,

22:09.277 --> 22:11.007
I've asked Esposito to
look into his financials.

22:11.127 --> 22:12.791
Maybe we'll see a
red flag somewhere.

22:12.911 --> 22:14.949
Oh, speaking of red flags.

22:15.551 --> 22:16.956
Hey, Demming.

22:17.429 --> 22:19.018
Hey. Hey, Castle.

22:19.721 --> 22:22.337
So you know that little place in
Asbury I was telling you about,

22:22.457 --> 22:24.184
around the corner from
our beach house? Mm-hmm.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.016
Well, they just had a
reservation open up on Friday.

22:27.289 --> 22:29.036
If we leave early enough,
we could probably make it.

22:29.610 --> 22:32.793
Yeah, um... will you
let me check into it?

22:33.123 --> 22:35.373
Great. I'll see you later.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.210
Beach house?

22:41.211 --> 22:43.415
Thought you were
working this weekend.

22:43.535 --> 22:45.579
Yeah, I'm sorry, Castle.
I shoulda just told you.

22:45.949 --> 22:49.615
I just didn't want things to be...
awkward between us

22:49.735 --> 22:52.342
now that Tom and I are... together.

22:55.684 --> 22:57.984
No, I get it. Yeah.

22:58.104 --> 23:00.252
No, you want your private
life to be private.

23:00.372 --> 23:01.221
Yeah, I-I just don't--

23:01.222 --> 23:03.471
I don't want anyone
to feel uncomfortable.

23:04.292 --> 23:06.299
No, of course not.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.639
No, I mean...

23:08.112 --> 23:11.081
actually, that makes what I
was gonna say a little easier.

23:11.626 --> 23:14.217
Um... well, with my book due,
I was thinking

23:14.337 --> 23:16.336
it'd be a good time for
us to take a break.

23:17.323 --> 23:18.170
A break?

23:18.290 --> 23:19.753
Yeah. Well, God knows,
you gotta be tired of me

23:19.873 --> 23:21.203
following you around all the time,

23:21.204 --> 23:22.947
and I really do need
to get some work done.

23:23.067 --> 23:24.990
With everyone gone,
I figure, why not just

23:25.383 --> 23:26.886
stay up in the Hamptons, you know?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.265
Get away from the city for a while.
Well, for how long?

23:29.385 --> 23:30.850
The summer at least.

23:31.338 --> 23:32.938
I thought this would
be our last case.

23:34.683 --> 23:36.083
Hey.

23:36.203 --> 23:38.018
So, uh, we...

23:43.300 --> 23:45.335
Everything okay? Great.

23:45.455 --> 23:48.598
Yeah, fine.
Uh, what'd you guys find?

23:48.718 --> 23:50.665
Surveillance stills
from the bus locker.

23:50.785 --> 23:52.252
Your Long Island
housewife was right.

23:52.372 --> 23:54.830
Roger picked up the
briefcase from locker 27-B

23:54.950 --> 23:56.122
shortly before 10:00 P.M.

23:56.242 --> 23:57.299
Great.

23:58.381 --> 24:00.529
You don't want to know
who put it in there?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.371
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah.

24:06.941 --> 24:09.402
That's Roger's handler
from Spy-Ventures.

24:10.472 --> 24:12.174
He said the briefcase
wasn't part of the game,

24:12.294 --> 24:14.195
so why is he putting
it in Roger's locker?

24:14.315 --> 24:16.548
And why did he lie? <i>Exactly.</i>

24:21.136 --> 24:22.826
What was in the briefcase, Hugo?

24:24.221 --> 24:25.408
We talked to your bosses, Hugo.

24:25.528 --> 24:26.542
We know it wasn't part of the game.

24:26.662 --> 24:28.172
And yet, you had
one of your players

24:28.292 --> 24:30.098
pick it up and deliver it for you.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.293
And he just happened
to end up dead.

24:32.781 --> 24:34.781
I didn't know.
You didn't know what?

24:34.901 --> 24:36.871
Look, no one was supposed
to get hurt. I just...

24:37.460 --> 24:38.930
I needed someone to
make the exchange.

24:39.050 --> 24:42.349
What was <i>in</i> the briefcase,
Hugo, drugs, money?

24:42.651 --> 24:44.386
I.D.s. I.D.s?

24:44.946 --> 24:46.852
Part of my job is to
make the I.D. kits--

24:46.972 --> 24:49.595
corporate badges, passports
from nonexistent countries.

24:49.882 --> 24:50.808
But with Jason's equipment,

24:50.928 --> 24:53.435
you can forge counterfeit I.
D.s for real countries, too.

24:54.338 --> 24:55.472
But it's illegal.

24:55.592 --> 24:57.177
But that didn't stop you, did it?

24:58.512 --> 24:59.980
So who did you sell to?

25:00.224 --> 25:01.875
College kids,
mostly looking to buy beer.

25:02.148 --> 25:04.145
And then you used game
players to make the drops.

25:04.265 --> 25:06.614
So if anybody got busted,
they couldn't identify me.

25:06.944 --> 25:08.791
I mean, these are college kids.
They'd roll over

25:08.911 --> 25:10.132
on their grandmothers
if they got caught.

25:10.252 --> 25:12.121
Well, something tells me
that Roger wasn't killed

25:12.241 --> 25:13.839
by a group of underaged
college kids.

25:13.959 --> 25:16.052
No, this last job,
it was different.

25:16.172 --> 25:17.010
I knew I shouldn't have taken it,

25:17.130 --> 25:18.689
but they were paying
so much money. Who?

25:19.292 --> 25:22.114
They're Ukrainians.
They found me on the Internet.

25:22.234 --> 25:23.431
They said they needed passports.

25:23.551 --> 25:25.238
I sent Roger to make the
drop and pick up the money.

25:25.669 --> 25:27.362
5,000 Euros.

25:27.482 --> 25:28.701
He thought it was
just another mission.

25:28.821 --> 25:29.772
But something must have gone wrong.

25:29.892 --> 25:31.673
After he made the drop,
he called me on the hotline,

25:32.348 --> 25:34.168
said he was being
followed by a dark sedan.

25:34.288 --> 25:36.854
A dark sedan?
And what time was this?

25:37.371 --> 25:38.490
11:30-ish.

25:38.610 --> 25:40.196
Look, playing the game,
it makes you paranoid.

25:40.316 --> 25:42.096
So I just--I figured it
was just his imagination.

25:43.316 --> 25:45.524
So I gave him the standard
line about evasive maneuvers.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.838
I didn't really think
he was being followed.

25:48.841 --> 25:51.218
But he was.

25:51.735 --> 25:53.312
He called again close to midnight

25:53.432 --> 25:55.234
and said his cover had been blown.

25:55.548 --> 25:57.702
I thought he was messing with me,
so I shined him on.

25:59.488 --> 26:01.382
I shined him on, and now he's dead.

26:02.258 --> 26:03.696
I must have done something wrong.

26:03.816 --> 26:05.617
I must have messed up
the passports or s--

26:06.033 --> 26:07.582
and they came after him
and they killed him.

26:07.702 --> 26:09.572
The briefcase-
where did he deliver it to?

26:12.248 --> 26:13.963
Hugo, the Ukrainians,

26:14.222 --> 26:16.319
I need an address now.

26:20.797 --> 26:21.963
Clear!

26:21.964 --> 26:23.428
Clear! Turn 'em around!

26:24.233 --> 26:26.558
Get up there,
now! Stay there! Stay there!

26:33.408 --> 26:35.908
They're kids.

26:39.552 --> 26:40.987
Yep.

26:41.107 --> 26:43.195
They're Ukrainians,
but they're students.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.948
They're used to being
able to drink back home,

26:45.068 --> 26:46.810
but they needed fake I.
D.s to buy booze here.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.620
They got Hugo's information
from another kid

26:48.740 --> 26:50.090
in the summer program.
Summer program?

26:50.210 --> 26:51.581
Yeah, they're part of the
summer exchange program

26:51.701 --> 26:54.088
at Hudson University.
Why? No reason.

26:54.361 --> 26:56.162
Anyway, none of them
own a dark sedan,

26:56.282 --> 26:57.798
and seeing as how they
all went out partying

26:57.918 --> 26:59.127
the moment Roger
dropped off the I.D.s,

26:59.247 --> 27:02.083
it's doubtful any of
them are our killer. Mm.

27:07.619 --> 27:09.266
You actually think he
was being followed?

27:09.653 --> 27:12.531
Well, he calls at 11:30 and
then just before he's shot.

27:12.651 --> 27:16.190
His car is damaged.
He runs on foot into the park.

27:16.310 --> 27:18.292
Sounds to me like
he was running away.

27:18.412 --> 27:19.542
But from whom?

27:19.662 --> 27:21.343
Well, as much as I'd
like to help you run down

27:21.463 --> 27:23.209
every dark sedan in the city,

27:23.654 --> 27:25.220
I have a poker game to host.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.272
See you in the morning.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.358
See ya.

27:31.832 --> 27:33.558
So...

27:33.931 --> 27:35.467
Castle's last case, huh?

27:35.587 --> 27:36.773
Mm-hmm.

27:36.893 --> 27:38.981
Ryan and I thought we'd do
a little going away party.

27:39.354 --> 27:41.750
Yeah. Well, it's not like
he's leaving forever.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.393
You sure about that?

27:45.505 --> 27:47.446
Why do you think he's been
following you around all this time?

27:47.955 --> 27:49.534
What, research?

27:49.654 --> 27:50.812
The guy has done enough research

27:50.932 --> 27:52.621
to write 50 books.

27:53.454 --> 27:56.059
Look... whatever the reason is,

27:56.518 --> 27:57.711
I'm pretty sure it doesn't include

27:57.831 --> 27:59.582
watching you be with another guy.

28:06.173 --> 28:07.938
A murder in the
middle of a spy game

28:08.058 --> 28:09.660
where nobody knows what's going on?

28:10.090 --> 28:11.383
I like that.

28:11.503 --> 28:13.392
The Ukrainians are a nice twist.

28:13.823 --> 28:15.383
So we've explained the money,

28:15.503 --> 28:17.230
the gadgets and the briefcase.

28:17.350 --> 28:19.611
The only thing we can't explain-
-why was he killed?

28:20.142 --> 28:22.245
Maybe that's because you're
looking in the wrong place.

28:22.647 --> 28:24.262
All right, Patterson.
Where would you look?

28:24.592 --> 28:26.210
If I was writing this,

28:26.330 --> 28:28.461
the murder would have nothing
to do with the spy game

28:28.734 --> 28:31.696
<i>except</i> that it gave the killer
an opportunity to act.

28:31.954 --> 28:34.202
Knowing that the trappings of
the game would cover his tracks.

28:34.322 --> 28:35.789
Which is pretty much
what's happened.

28:35.909 --> 28:38.452
Look, Rick, as much trouble
as we go to with these novels,

28:38.572 --> 28:40.573
there's only three reasons
to commit a murder--

28:40.846 --> 28:43.218
love, money and to
cover up a crime.

28:43.338 --> 28:44.577
Cannell's right.

28:44.697 --> 28:45.919
I'd spend more time
looking at your victim

28:46.039 --> 28:47.367
and less time looking at the game.

28:47.487 --> 28:48.921
Personally, I'd spend
more time writing

28:49.041 --> 28:51.028
and less time hanging out
with your cop friend.

28:51.416 --> 28:54.111
I mean, really, Ricky,
just one book a year?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.530
Kinda thin, Rick.

28:57.481 --> 28:59.146
She seems like more
of a distraction

28:59.548 --> 29:01.328
than a muse.

29:03.464 --> 29:05.102
No, you're right.

29:05.222 --> 29:06.918
I think I've gotten
everything I can get

29:07.038 --> 29:09.978
out of that relationship anyway.

29:31.023 --> 29:32.434
Hey.

29:32.554 --> 29:34.254
You ready?

29:34.952 --> 29:37.097
Yeah. Yeah.

29:57.456 --> 29:58.581
Hey.

29:58.701 --> 29:59.894
Hey.

30:00.014 --> 30:01.948
Uh...

30:02.508 --> 30:04.810
I was just thinking...

30:04.930 --> 30:06.097
May--

30:06.217 --> 30:08.399
yeah.

30:09.073 --> 30:10.840
I've been thinking...

30:12.069 --> 30:14.187
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

30:14.488 --> 30:16.670
Maybe the murder has nothing
to do with the game.

30:16.790 --> 30:18.326
Be it just afforded the killer

30:18.446 --> 30:19.805
an opportunity to act.

30:21.104 --> 30:23.149
That's so f-funny,

30:23.150 --> 30:24.832
because I was thinking
the same thing

30:24.952 --> 30:26.291
when I woke up this morning,

30:26.411 --> 30:28.208
that maybe we got so
caught up in the game

30:28.328 --> 30:30.429
that we stopped looking
at what really mattered.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.841
The victim.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.760
Exactly. So check this out.

30:36.382 --> 30:37.990
His financials came back clean.

30:38.110 --> 30:40.371
But then we did a search on his
business partner, Lee Copley,

30:40.491 --> 30:43.679
and it turns out that he filed
for bankruptcy two months ago--

30:43.799 --> 30:46.509
overextended himself in real estate.
Let me guess, if Roger dies,

30:46.629 --> 30:48.137
his half of the
business goes to Copley.

30:49.130 --> 30:50.709
Over half a million dollars worth.

30:51.226 --> 30:53.078
His wife did say,
the only two people who knew

30:53.198 --> 30:55.006
Roger was in the city
were her and Copley.

30:55.589 --> 30:57.053
And guess what Copley drives.

30:58.029 --> 30:59.422
A dark sedan?

30:59.542 --> 31:01.252
Roger was my friend.
We grew up together.

31:01.372 --> 31:02.153
Why would I kill him?

31:02.273 --> 31:03.678
I can give you half a
million reasons why.

31:03.798 --> 31:05.420
What, because I'm having
financial problems?

31:05.707 --> 31:07.241
Because we just happen to
own a business together?

31:07.361 --> 31:08.768
Greed, Mr. Copley,

31:08.888 --> 31:11.544
it's the purest motive there is.
Oh, this is ridiculous.

31:11.664 --> 31:13.758
Where were you the night that
Roger Farraday was murdered?

31:13.878 --> 31:15.264
I was home in bed.

31:15.384 --> 31:16.991
Really? Then do you
care to explain these?

31:17.111 --> 31:19.726
These are photos of you
leaving your apartment garage

31:19.846 --> 31:22.071
at 8:00 the night
that he was murdered.

31:22.191 --> 31:24.581
And the phot of you returning
the following morning

31:24.701 --> 31:26.964
at 7:00 A.M. kinda blows
a hole in your whole

31:27.084 --> 31:29.583
"home in bed" thing.
You lied to me, Mr. Copley.

31:29.703 --> 31:31.675
Do you care to revise
your statement?

31:32.134 --> 31:34.190
8:00 P.M. that's plenty of time

31:34.310 --> 31:36.948
to drive to the city from Stamford.
What'd you do, Lee?

31:37.068 --> 31:39.503
Wait for him at the hotel,
follow him till he was alone?

31:39.623 --> 31:41.691
No, I didn't. And then you
used the game as cover.

31:41.811 --> 31:43.715
No. Look, I swear, I didn't do it.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.878
Right. You were at home in bed.

31:45.998 --> 31:49.255
No, I wasn't... at home,
but I was in bed...

31:52.427 --> 31:54.201
With his wife.

31:54.660 --> 31:56.389
I'm sorry. What?

31:57.123 --> 31:59.565
I was in bed with Roger's wife.

32:04.838 --> 32:06.144
Let me-- let me get this straight.

32:06.264 --> 32:08.326
You-your alibi for
killing your friend

32:08.446 --> 32:11.035
is you were doing his-- his wife?

32:13.461 --> 32:14.408
Yeah.

32:16.982 --> 32:18.030
Wow.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.117
What? You want me to say I'm sorry?

32:20.237 --> 32:22.335
You want me to be
embarrassed? I'm not.

32:23.034 --> 32:25.288
Do you know how long it had been
since Roger and I made love?

32:25.532 --> 32:28.451
All he cared about was work
and his extreme vacations.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.954
So, yeah, I was seeing Lee.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.790
Yeah, I was with him that night.

32:32.910 --> 32:35.601
Well, if things were that bad,
why not just get a divorce?

32:35.721 --> 32:38.950
Are you serious?
My house is too nice.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.074
I can see why Roger needed

32:43.194 --> 32:45.545
a little extra fantasy in his life.
I talked to the wife's neighbors.

32:45.665 --> 32:47.848
A few of them remember Lee's car
outside the house that night.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.041
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

32:49.161 --> 32:51.337
The guy runs an auto dealership.
He could've just switched cars.

32:51.596 --> 32:53.160
True, except it was a warm night,

32:53.404 --> 32:55.362
warm enough to leave the
windows open. Oh, no.

32:55.482 --> 32:57.425
Oh, yes. The next-door
neighbor distinctly remembers

32:57.545 --> 32:59.694
hearing the sounds of loud,
passionate lovemaking

32:59.814 --> 33:01.205
coming from the
open bedroom window.

33:01.492 --> 33:03.504
Kept him up till well past midnight.
I don't buy it.

33:04.308 --> 33:05.568
They both had motive.

33:05.688 --> 33:08.347
They were having an affair.
They knew exactly where he was.

33:08.467 --> 33:10.623
Just because they had an alibi
does not mean they didn't do it.

33:10.743 --> 33:11.995
Do you think they hired someone?

33:12.115 --> 33:13.728
It had all the hallmarks
of a professional hit.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.649
Well, it couldn't have
been Lee unless he asked

33:15.769 --> 33:17.787
the bankruptcy court for
permission to hire a hit man,

33:17.907 --> 33:19.318
and I don't think that's likely.

33:19.438 --> 33:21.488
And the only unusual charge
on the Farradays' account

33:21.608 --> 33:23.402
was the 10 grand
that Roger wired to

33:23.522 --> 33:25.322
the Spy-Ventures account
in the Cayman Islands.

33:25.609 --> 33:27.255
10 grand? Yeah, why?

33:27.375 --> 33:29.069
Because he only should've
paid half that much.

33:29.189 --> 33:30.662
Do you remember what the
woman at Spy-Ventures

33:30.782 --> 33:31.895
said about the money
we found in the car?

33:32.015 --> 33:34.679
Yeah, that 5,000 Euros was
more than what he paid

33:34.799 --> 33:36.048
for his entire spy-cation.

33:36.168 --> 33:38.632
His bank statement
indicates he transferred

33:38.752 --> 33:40.864
2 payments of 5 grand
each to the game,

33:40.984 --> 33:42.808
for a total of $10,000.

33:44.013 --> 33:45.764
The payments were
made at the same time,

33:45.884 --> 33:47.095
almost like he paid twice.

33:47.215 --> 33:49.322
If these numbers are correct,
he did pay twice--

33:49.442 --> 33:52.177
once for him, once for another
player. Another player?

33:52.297 --> 33:54.277
Who was the other player?

33:54.937 --> 33:56.118
Andrea Fisher.

33:56.238 --> 33:57.672
Our Long Island housewife?

33:57.792 --> 33:58.799
She said she never met Roger

33:58.919 --> 34:00.755
until they were teamed
up for the game.

34:02.332 --> 34:06.067
Well, if they never met,
why did he pay for her?

34:09.661 --> 34:11.023
There must be some mistake.

34:12.665 --> 34:14.596
We checked with the bank,
Mrs. Fisher.

34:14.716 --> 34:16.135
There is no mistake.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.690
We checked with the bank,
you never paid Spy-Ventures.

34:19.079 --> 34:20.447
But Roger did.

34:21.724 --> 34:23.313
The coupon clipping was
a nice touch, though.

34:23.433 --> 34:25.306
I assume that was for
your husband's benefit?

34:25.427 --> 34:26.818
What was the nature
of your relationship

34:26.938 --> 34:28.520
with Roger Farraday?

34:30.799 --> 34:32.860
We were, um...

34:33.219 --> 34:35.478
friends.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.601
When did the two of you first meet?

34:40.934 --> 34:42.237
Last year.

34:42.358 --> 34:45.253
I was, uh, I was taking
my daughter Shelby

34:45.373 --> 34:47.512
into, uh, the city
for dance classes.

34:48.029 --> 34:51.665
After I dropped her off,
I'd go to the museum.

34:51.666 --> 34:53.195
Every week, I'd see him,

34:53.315 --> 34:55.409
standing in front of monet's "
Water Lilies."

34:55.876 --> 34:58.561
You know, for an hour,
it wasn't "mommy can you do this"

34:58.681 --> 35:00.892
or "honey can you do that.
" You know, I was me.

35:01.355 --> 35:02.389
Oh, God.

35:02.509 --> 35:05.512
After a few weeks,
the museum turned into a hotel.

35:05.632 --> 35:08.712
And... then Shelby's
dance classes ended.

35:09.071 --> 35:11.128
You had no excuse to go
into the city anymore.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.034
When we first met,
we pretended to be spies,

35:16.450 --> 35:18.380
exchanging secrets at the museum.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.964
Roger thought, why not have
a real-life spy adventure?

35:21.567 --> 35:24.852
And we could have one
last time together.

35:24.972 --> 35:26.795
Hey, hon. I'm back.

35:26.915 --> 35:28.781
Oh, my God. Please
don't tell my husband.

35:30.332 --> 35:32.104
We don't have to, Mrs. Fisher.

35:32.606 --> 35:34.268
He already knows.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.332
What's going on?

35:39.452 --> 35:43.098
Mr. Fischer, I'm Detective
Kate Beckett, NYPD.

35:43.781 --> 35:44.786
What's this about?

35:44.906 --> 35:47.158
You own a black 2009 4-door sedan?

35:47.445 --> 35:48.982
Yeah. Why?

35:49.102 --> 35:50.832
Where is it? It's in the shop.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.913
I hit a pole while I was
backing out at the supermarket.

35:54.530 --> 35:56.569
You're a much better
shot than you are a liar.

35:56.689 --> 35:59.279
The state of New York lists you
as a registered gun owner--

35:59.788 --> 36:01.353
glock 45.

36:01.473 --> 36:02.868
Oh, my God.

36:02.988 --> 36:05.953
Oh, my God. What did you do to him?

36:12.229 --> 36:14.569
What he deserved.

36:15.422 --> 36:17.503
Oh, my God.

36:21.529 --> 36:23.538
So Roger was right about
being followed that night.

36:23.658 --> 36:25.550
Well, when the husband
got on to the affair,

36:25.670 --> 36:27.851
he did a little spy
game of his own--

36:27.971 --> 36:30.059
tracked down and killed
his wife's lover.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.525
Mm. Two affairs,
a loveless marriage...

36:34.343 --> 36:36.764
It's sad a man had to die
because all the people involved

36:36.884 --> 36:38.927
were too scared to say
what they really felt.

36:41.030 --> 36:42.958
Yes, it is sad.

36:43.365 --> 36:45.299
And how many shows like that?

36:45.300 --> 36:47.972
Mm-hmm. Sure. Well, make it two,
and you got a deal. All right.

36:48.528 --> 36:50.882
Hey, I gotta run.
I gotta drive Alexis to Princeton.

36:51.002 --> 36:53.362
But I will be back in time for
that little surprise party

36:53.482 --> 36:55.845
the boys are throwing for me-
what? What?

36:57.208 --> 36:59.407
Nothing.

36:59.914 --> 37:01.725
<i>Okay.</i> I'll see you.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.819
Mm-hmm.

37:03.939 --> 37:07.006
Yeah, I told you.
It's the best coffee.

37:07.379 --> 37:08.743
It's like a real restaurant-style

37:08.863 --> 37:10.567
cappuccino machine.

37:19.489 --> 37:20.594
Oops!

37:20.714 --> 37:22.499
Is there anything
you're not bringing?

37:23.347 --> 37:25.844
You. Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

37:25.964 --> 37:27.850
This is the first time you've
ever been alone this long.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.747
I'm supposed to be
saying that to you.

37:29.867 --> 37:32.607
And besides, I might not
be alone for very long.

37:32.727 --> 37:33.619
You invited someone?

37:33.739 --> 37:36.489
She said no at first, but I got
a feeling she'll come around.

37:36.609 --> 37:38.031
Oh. Is it anyone I know?

37:38.478 --> 37:39.858
I don't kiss and tell.

37:39.978 --> 37:41.693
Wow. It looks like
I'm not the only one

37:41.813 --> 37:43.736
who's getting lucky this summer.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.254
Kidding. Kidding.

37:45.374 --> 37:46.605
I'm just--I'm just kidding.

37:46.725 --> 37:49.417
That's not funny.
Oh, that's so not funny.

37:51.755 --> 37:54.057
It's not just this weekend
we're talking about, is it?

37:55.420 --> 37:57.237
No.

37:57.357 --> 37:59.436
No.

38:02.465 --> 38:04.280
Was it something I said, Kate?

38:04.773 --> 38:05.835
Or something I did?

38:05.955 --> 38:07.837
No. You're great.

38:07.957 --> 38:10.707
You're really great,
and I really like you.

38:12.545 --> 38:14.070
It's just, I don't think

38:14.190 --> 38:15.977
that this is what I'm
looking for right now.

38:17.892 --> 38:20.203
Well, what is it you're
looking for, Kate?

38:27.556 --> 38:29.017
It was very emotional.

38:29.137 --> 38:30.861
Yeah, there were a lot of tears.

38:30.981 --> 38:33.015
Um, Alexis was fine, by the way.

38:36.049 --> 38:38.121
Ah.

38:38.479 --> 38:40.041
I gotta say, Castle,

38:40.399 --> 38:42.398
we're gonna miss you around here.

38:44.164 --> 38:46.335
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

38:49.802 --> 38:51.597
You're still leaving the
coffee machine, though, right?

38:51.717 --> 38:53.440
I can't have you suffer in my absence.
Oh, that's good.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.137
Oh, we could really use one
of those down in the morgue.

38:55.257 --> 38:58.237
With Castle gone, I just hope
our clearance rate doesn't drop.

38:58.357 --> 39:00.987
Look at that.
He's getting on us already.

39:01.107 --> 39:03.537
Oh! Look who's off duty.

39:03.657 --> 39:05.491
Yeah, well, Castle,
I'm not all work.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.227
Don't get into a drinking
contest with her.

39:07.347 --> 39:08.997
She can take you. Thank you.

39:09.117 --> 39:10.950
Oh, I don't need to
drink to take him.

39:11.070 --> 39:13.643
Ooh! What's gotten into you?

39:13.763 --> 39:15.147
Castle, do you have a second?

39:15.267 --> 39:17.004
Of course. Yeah.

39:21.561 --> 39:23.270
What's up?

39:25.497 --> 39:27.438
Look... I know that I'm not

39:27.439 --> 39:29.138
the easiest person to get to know,

39:29.698 --> 39:33.402
and... I don't always let
on what's on my mind.

39:34.062 --> 39:36.995
But... this past year,
working with you...

39:39.579 --> 39:41.560
I've had a really good time.

39:41.919 --> 39:43.742
Yeah. Me, too.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.294
So I'm--I'm just
gonna say this and--

39:47.414 --> 39:49.390
Richard... You ready?

39:49.510 --> 39:50.699
Hey, Gina.

39:50.819 --> 39:52.455
Um, Beckett, you remember Gina,
my ex-wife.

39:52.575 --> 39:53.603
And publisher.

39:53.723 --> 39:55.522
Yes. Yeah, we spoke the other day.

39:55.642 --> 39:58.082
Looks like you finally
tracked him down. Oh, yeah.

39:58.404 --> 39:59.940
He's such a little boy sometimes.

40:00.060 --> 40:03.247
I mean, I don't know why.
It's not like I bite... much.

40:03.367 --> 40:05.456
Well, we better get going

40:05.576 --> 40:07.300
or we're gonna be stuck in
traffic all night. Going?

40:07.420 --> 40:09.528
To the Hamptons. For the weekend?

40:09.648 --> 40:11.454
No, for the summer, actually.

40:11.574 --> 40:14.153
So I can stay on top of him
while he finishes his book.

40:16.063 --> 40:17.757
I'm sorry.

40:17.877 --> 40:19.614
I-I didn't think the
two of you got along.

40:20.059 --> 40:23.002
We didn't. But then
last night on the phone,

40:23.122 --> 40:24.449
we started talking...

40:24.569 --> 40:26.843
and we ended up talking
for hours. Yeah.

40:27.101 --> 40:29.924
Just like old times. Yeah.

40:33.392 --> 40:34.376
So...

40:34.496 --> 40:35.338
I'm sorry.

40:35.458 --> 40:36.962
You were, uh, you were
telling me something.

40:37.082 --> 40:39.948
Yeah, I wanted to say,
have a great summer.

40:41.465 --> 40:43.299
You, too.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.726
A-and like you said,

40:44.846 --> 40:47.094
it's--it's been really,
really great.

40:47.937 --> 40:50.352
Yeah... it has.

40:51.707 --> 40:53.707
Well--oh.

40:53.708 --> 40:55.541
Just...

41:04.287 --> 41:06.785
See you in the fall?

41:06.905 --> 41:10.255
See you in the fall.
