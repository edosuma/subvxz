WEBVTT

00:14.040 --> 00:15.760
-Ah!

00:17.200 --> 00:18.240
Morning.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.680
Er, sorry, finishing touches.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.400
Sparkling?

00:24.440 --> 00:25.560
Mmm.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.080
What time does your father arrive?

00:27.120 --> 00:28.360
HUMPHREY: Erm...

00:28.400 --> 00:29.800
In about an hour, I think.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.160
We're meeting up at the courthouse,

00:32.200 --> 00:33.560
after the murder trial.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.280
-Did you pick up the... -Case files are in

00:33.600 --> 00:36.280
the Jeep, sir.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.720
Good, good.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.520
-An open-and-shut case.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.160
Jack Harmer shoots dead the pastor's wife,

00:43.200 --> 00:44.280
Sabine Mason,

00:44.320 --> 00:46.000
in a marina drugs drop gone wrong.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.200
Right!

00:47.240 --> 00:50.120
Let's put this murderer behind bars, shall we?

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
FLORENCE: Uh...

01:01.560 --> 01:04.560
Everything all right in the back, JP?

01:30.440 --> 01:32.040
Morning.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.480
EROL: Dwayne. DWAYNE: Yes, eh?

01:33.520 --> 01:34.760
Morning.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.840
We'll be here the whole time. Just so you know.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.520
Um, nice and calm.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.000
This is Erol. He's been staying calm

01:40.040 --> 01:41.920
since long before you were born.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.200
I had the pleasure of Mr Harmer's company

01:41.960 --> 01:45.200
at the pre-trial hearing.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.760
Get him inside.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.240
It's a long way for your dad to come for just a few days.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.240
-Via e-mail.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.840
As I say, we're not particularly close.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.520
No, I'm beginning to get that.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.120
Can you make sure those are deposited into

02:02.560 --> 02:05.120
the evidence store?

02:05.160 --> 02:06.520
Thank you.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.600
Ah, Pastor Mason.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.800
Good morning, Inspector.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.320
-A little apprehensive.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.360
But justice will be done, I'm sure.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.760
Will you tell my wife that I'm here?

02:33.800 --> 02:36.280
She will see you in the courtroom.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.320
A little light refreshment, gentlemen?

02:43.360 --> 02:45.160
Erol, I like your way of thinking, you know!

02:51.520 --> 02:52.600
DWAYNE: JP!

03:11.200 --> 03:12.600
Er, yes, fine.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.040
Yes, um...

03:14.080 --> 03:16.320
As you said, open-and-shut case.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.320
What could possibly go wrong?

03:18.360 --> 03:20.080
EROL: This rum will make your toes curl!

03:20.120 --> 03:21.880
DWAYNE: I certainly hope so!

03:21.920 --> 03:24.080
Oh...

03:24.120 --> 03:26.040
EROL: I have some more in the kitchen.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.520
Just wait, wait.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.600
-Hey, hey, hurry back now! -Mmm-hmm.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.480
-MAN: Oh, no!

03:36.840 --> 03:39.280
-We have to move the prisoner! -Oh, no!

03:41.160 --> 03:42.520
JP: How do you know it's not a drill?

03:42.560 --> 03:45.040
Because I'm the one who organises the drills.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.440
That looks like blood!

03:46.480 --> 03:47.480
He's bleeding!

03:50.200 --> 03:51.640
He's been shot, I think.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.720
He's dead!

03:55.760 --> 03:58.160
Someone must've got in. They can't have got far.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.280
Right. Keys!

03:59.320 --> 04:00.800
JP, check the prisoner entrance.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.920
Erol, you stay here.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.880
Dwayne! Where on earth is that alarm coming from?

04:05.920 --> 04:08.280
He's dead, Chief. Jack Harmer's been shot.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.920
-Hey! Stop!

04:14.320 --> 04:15.440
HUMPHREY: Lock down the entire courthouse.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.720
Nobody leaves, nobody enters.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.320
We placed him in the cell, locked the cell door.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.880
-I did.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.040
And he came in through the prisoner entrance,

05:03.080 --> 05:04.600
which was locked behind you?

05:04.640 --> 05:07.000
Yes. And the security door

05:04.640 --> 05:07.000
at the courthouse end

05:07.040 --> 05:09.640
was also locked when we left the victim

05:07.040 --> 05:09.640
alone in the cell.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.640
Erol unlocked it when we came to investigate

05:11.680 --> 05:13.320
after the alarm had sounded.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.720
See, it's protocol,

05:14.760 --> 05:17.080
to move the prisoners outside

05:14.760 --> 05:17.080
in the event of a fire.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.440
FLORENCE: But there was no fire?

05:18.920 --> 05:20.280
EROL: No.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.720
We did a complete sweep of the courthouse,

05:21.760 --> 05:23.400
and nothing.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.800
-No.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.280
Look, the killer must have used

05:25.840 --> 05:28.280
a silencer.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.360
Either that, or the sound of the alarm

05:28.320 --> 05:31.360
drowned out the gunshot.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.200
How many keys are there to this cell

05:33.240 --> 05:34.880
and the other two doors?

05:34.920 --> 05:36.520
Every door has its own key,

05:36.560 --> 05:38.480
and there's only one copy of each.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.960
And that prisoner entrance can only be unlocked

05:38.520 --> 05:41.960
and opened from the inside.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.840
FLORENCE: Where are these keys kept?

05:43.880 --> 05:46.720
EROL: I keep them with me at all times.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.360
And at night, they are locked in the safe,

05:46.760 --> 05:50.360
you know, in the office.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.960
And nobody else has access to these?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.200
Just me.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.800
JP, the car?

05:55.840 --> 05:57.640
The only thing I can say for certain

05:57.680 --> 05:59.800
is that it was an old green Citroen.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.320
Was Jack Harmer served anything to eat here?

06:02.360 --> 06:03.840
No, nothing.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.000
And when was the cell last cleaned?

06:06.040 --> 06:07.680
Last night, why?

06:07.720 --> 06:08.880
There are ants.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.520
DWAYNE: Chief, this is Honore.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.840
It's hot.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.680
-We have ants! -Hmm.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.120
I just thought it was time.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.920
-No.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.160
So, if I understand this correctly,

06:39.200 --> 06:41.880
there are two points of entry to this corridor,

06:41.920 --> 06:44.920
neither of which the killer could have got through.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.280
-It was 9:47.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.400
DWAYNE: JP!

06:49.600 --> 06:51.880
JP: <i> I remember looking</i> <i>at my watch.</i>

06:51.920 --> 06:55.160
<i>We returned 9:53.</i>

06:55.200 --> 06:57.320
Which means that, within that six-minute window,

06:57.360 --> 06:59.520
I would wager that our killer

07:00.400 --> 07:02.320
reached through these here bars,

07:02.360 --> 07:04.800
shot him and then made off.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.480
But why the alarm

07:07.520 --> 07:08.840
Was it the killer?

07:08.880 --> 07:10.920
All possible, Florence.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
All possible.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.280
But whichever it is, it still doesn't explain

07:15.320 --> 07:16.920
how the killer managed to gain entry to the corridor

07:16.960 --> 07:18.520
in the first place.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.320
And you definitely didn't see anyone?

07:25.160 --> 07:26.600
We sat right there.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.120
A clear sightline to the door.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.120
And was Erol with you the whole time?

07:32.160 --> 07:35.200
Well, not quite the whole time.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.120
I mean, he went to go and get some refreshments.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.360
"Refreshments?"

07:41.800 --> 07:43.040
Yes.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.480
He left not long before the fire alarm went off.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.880
Went to the kitchen next door and came straight back here.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.440
And, JP.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.720
This car,

07:53.760 --> 07:55.960
this old green Citroen.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.920
Jack Harmer is murdered.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.480
Seconds later, a car speeds away from

07:59.520 --> 08:01.640
the back of the courthouse at breakneck speed.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.240
-JP: Hey! Stop!

08:05.120 --> 08:06.800
That's got to be our guy, Chief.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.280
You would think so, Dwayne.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.760
You would think so.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.200
Right, to sum up,

08:13.240 --> 08:14.680
no-one could have got through the prisoners' entrance

08:14.720 --> 08:17.480
as it can only be unlocked and opened from the inside,

08:17.520 --> 08:19.360
leaving the courthouse entrance.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.360
But then, to enter that way, someone would've,

08:21.400 --> 08:22.600
A, needed a key

08:22.640 --> 08:24.920
and, B, made it past Erol's office unnoticed,

08:24.960 --> 08:26.640
which would seem to discount both.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.200
So how did they make it to the cell?

08:30.520 --> 08:31.880
Right.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.360
Dwayne, run checks on the green car.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.640
Have any been rented, stolen, or sold in recent weeks?

08:35.680 --> 08:37.760
JP, dust the cell and corridor for prints.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.080
Also see if you can find which fire alarm point was

08:37.800 --> 08:40.080
set off.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.120
-Yes, sir. -Florence,

08:42.160 --> 08:44.560
release all those who were in the courtroom with us

08:42.160 --> 08:44.560
at the time of death.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.840
Assemble everyone else for questioning,

08:45.880 --> 08:48.200
just in case the killer wasn't in that car.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.440
Also, there was a reporter outside earlier,

08:50.480 --> 08:51.760
let's recover that camera.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.240
Yes, sir.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.800
And we do need to break the news to

08:53.280 --> 08:55.800
Mr Harmer's wife.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.920
I don't understand.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.240
How can he have been shot?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.640
Yes, well, we're currently investigating

09:02.280 --> 09:04.640
the possibility

09:04.680 --> 09:06.640
that the gunman may have breached security,

09:06.680 --> 09:09.520
and made it to your husband's holding cell.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.960
You let him die!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.640
-No, no... -He should've been protected.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.040
You should've been protecting him.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.480
I want to see him!

09:16.520 --> 09:18.560
Yes, of course. Um, as soon as

09:16.520 --> 09:18.560
we've finished here.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.920
-Yes, please, come in.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.240
DWAYNE: Gentlemen...

09:25.680 --> 09:28.880
HUMPHREY: Er, thank you. Please, do sit down.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.400
As you're all aware, Jack Harmer was murdered

09:28.920 --> 09:32.400
this morning in his cell.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.040
We believe that he was killed at some point between

09:34.080 --> 09:36.960
9:47 and 9:53 a.m.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.280
There's a six-minute window

09:38.320 --> 09:40.480
when courthouse security was breached.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.280
Mrs Harmer, do you remember where you were at this time?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.520
I was outside, I think.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.440
Did you talk to anyone

09:51.960 --> 09:53.320
Thank you.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.600
Pastor Mason, when I spoke to you

09:53.360 --> 09:55.600
this morning,

09:55.640 --> 09:57.600
you were out in the main entrance area.

09:57.640 --> 10:01.680
-No, I was there

09:57.640 --> 10:01.680
the whole time.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.960
And during those six minutes,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.480
did you see anyone, talk to anyone?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.920
PASTOR MASON: I don't think so.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.640
There weren't too many people around at the time.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.280
-I must've been.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.440
Mr Dumas, as we've ascertained,

10:13.480 --> 10:15.120
you were with my officers for some of the time,

10:15.160 --> 10:16.440
not all of it.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.360
You left them in your office to go to the kitchen?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.720
I was only there a matter of moments.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.320
And while I was heading back, I heard the alarm go off, yes.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.520
There's no way he could've got to Jack's cell

10:24.360 --> 10:27.520
and back in that time.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.880
Okay. Thank you. That's all for now.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.160
Er, if you'd like to make your way back

10:29.920 --> 10:32.160
out to the main foyer,

10:32.200 --> 10:34.720
my colleague will be taking exclusion prints.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.040
You will also be searched, as a matter of course,

10:37.080 --> 10:38.920
on your way out by Officer Myers here.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.720
-Thank you. -DWAYNE: Gentlemen, <i> madame.</i>

10:50.280 --> 10:53.040
If, as I suspect, the body search

10:50.280 --> 10:53.040
produces nothing,

10:53.080 --> 10:54.320
it might be worth, you and JP

10:54.360 --> 10:56.080
taking a look round the rest of the courthouse.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.040
You think the gun's still here?

10:58.080 --> 10:59.680
If the killer escaped in the green car,

10:59.720 --> 11:02.560
then, no, the murder weapon

10:59.720 --> 11:02.560
is long gone.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.040
But if our murderer is one of those three,

11:05.080 --> 11:07.040
then that gun cannot be too far away.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.720
Chief.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.200
Huh!

11:13.040 --> 11:15.240
What a mess.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.560
Right, let's get back to the station,

11:15.280 --> 11:17.560
let's print the photos...

11:17.600 --> 11:19.080
-MARTIN: Humphrey! -Oh, Lord!

11:19.120 --> 11:20.320
What the bloody hell's going on?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.720
Ah! You made it.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.080
I've been trying to call you, but it appears

11:23.120 --> 11:24.440
impossible to get a signal.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.080
What's happened?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.920
Ah, yes. Er, a prisoner was shot dead

11:27.120 --> 11:29.920
this morning in his cell.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.800
I'm afraid I may have to postpone our lunch.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.560
Shot

11:34.600 --> 11:36.000
Well, if you're the island's finest,

11:36.040 --> 11:37.160
we're all in trouble, aren't we?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.760
Yes, very good.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.240
Look, here's the key, um...

11:41.280 --> 11:42.480
Here's the key to the shack.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.120
I thought you lived in a seaside villa?

11:47.160 --> 11:48.960
Yes, that's what Mum chooses to call it.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.760
It's a bit more bijou than that, I'm afraid.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.280
But, anyway, um, here's the address,

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
it's not far.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.560
I really ought to be going.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.240
-Sorry. I'm so, so sorry...

12:00.000 --> 12:02.720
FLORENCE: I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.720
It's fine, I'm fine.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.320
-Thank you, sir. -Oh, I'm sorry.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.360
Uh, yes. Florence, this is Martin.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.600
Martin Goodman QC.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.760
My dad.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.040
Hello. Welcome to Saint Marie.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.160
If you need any tips or good places to...

12:19.200 --> 12:21.080
No, I think I'll head to the villa.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.240
Good.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.360
Right, okay, see you later.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.920
No, macaque, I said a green Citroen!

12:30.960 --> 12:32.480
Yes. Okay.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.800
Let me know quick. Thanks.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.840
Well?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.960
So, that's the cell, the corridor

12:38.000 --> 12:39.760
and the security doors all dusted.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.080
And I've collected all the exclusion prints.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.720
Wow, that was fast work.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.240
You trying to make me look bad?

12:45.280 --> 12:46.920
Anyway, the chief wants us

12:46.960 --> 12:48.120
to search the courthouse for the gun.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.520
JP: Okay.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.000
It's only, he asked me to locate

12:51.040 --> 12:53.000
the fire alarm that was set off.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.040
So I'll do the fire alarms and you search the courthouse.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.280
I think that's for the best.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.520
HUMPHREY: Yeah, thank you. FLORENCE: Thank you.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.360
HUMPHREY: The prison are sending over

13:07.360 --> 13:09.360
Jack's personal effects.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.280
They'll be with us in the morning.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.560
And that was pathology.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.200
They recovered the bullet from Jack's body.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.960
A .22 calibre pistol was used.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.600
So, how on earth did our murderer gain access

13:19.640 --> 13:22.520
to Jack Harmer's cell to shoot him?

13:22.560 --> 13:24.560
Well, until we solve that little conundrum,

13:24.600 --> 13:25.720
let's focus on what we do know.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.040
Background checks?

13:27.080 --> 13:28.160
FLORENCE: Jack Harmer,

13:28.200 --> 13:30.280
he moved to Saint Marie two years ago.

13:30.320 --> 13:34.120
-In 2003, he and his brother...

13:34.160 --> 13:37.640
...Were arrested for a bank robbery

13:34.160 --> 13:37.640
back in London.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.160
Paul testified against Jack in return for his own freedom.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.720
He ratted him out.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.840
Jack spent 10 years behind bars,

13:43.880 --> 13:45.320
and then came to Honore,

13:45.360 --> 13:47.840
where he quickly established a drug-trafficking operation.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.760
<i>During a drugs drop-off</i> <i>at the marina,</i>

13:52.800 --> 13:54.360
<i>he was interrupted</i> <i>by Sabine Mason.</i>

13:54.400 --> 13:55.760
HUMPHREY: <i> Pastor Mason's wife.</i>

13:55.800 --> 13:57.880
<i>-She panics</i> <i>and begins to scream.</i>

13:57.920 --> 14:00.760
<i></i>

14:00.800 --> 14:03.560
An anonymous tip-off led us to his villa

14:03.600 --> 14:05.200
and the murder weapon.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.680
Though we were never able to establish

14:06.720 --> 14:09.160
who sent that note with the sunken letter E.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.840
So, what of the other suspects?

14:10.880 --> 14:11.920
FLORENCE: Mae Harmer.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.720
She was originally engaged to Paul,

14:13.760 --> 14:17.120
but after he testified against his own brother, Jack,

14:17.160 --> 14:19.240
Mae began to visit Jack in prison.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.600
A relationship formed and she left Paul,

14:21.640 --> 14:23.960
eventually fleeing to Honore with Jack.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.760
Well, there's a motive right there.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.240
Did Paul want to avenge the man

14:27.280 --> 14:28.960
who ran off with his girl?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.960
-England.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.880
He was jailed a few months back,

14:32.920 --> 14:35.080
and was released four weeks ago.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.400
Contact border control.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.520
Check he hasn't left the country.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.960
-Yes, sir. -Excellent.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.200
-Pastor Mason.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.760
Husband of the recently deceased

14:41.240 --> 14:43.760
Sabine Mason.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.040
Well known and respected within the community.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.760
And what about Erol Dumas?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.240
FLORENCE: Courthouse security.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.960
Dwayne said he used to be a bit of a ladies' man,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.240
but seemed to calm down a few years ago.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.880
So, what of the fact that Erol left the boys

14:55.920 --> 14:58.200
to go in search of, er, "refreshments?"

14:58.240 --> 15:01.120
Not enough time to head back down to the cell,

15:01.160 --> 15:03.040
unlock the first security door,

15:03.080 --> 15:05.840
shoot the victim, return and dispose of a gun.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.840
Quite. So the question remains.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.840
Who killed Jack Harmer, how and why?

15:10.880 --> 15:11.880
A question...

15:12.960 --> 15:15.600
I was just about to ask you, Inspector.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.800
A prisoner dead.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.080
In our custody.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.880
You have any leads?

15:20.920 --> 15:24.640
Because I've had the <i> Saint Marie Times</i>

15:20.920 --> 15:24.640
on my case all morning

15:24.680 --> 15:27.640
wanting to know exactly how a prisoner dies

15:27.680 --> 15:30.320
behind bars, in our care.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.160
Would you like a coffee?

15:35.520 --> 15:37.600
I would like a conviction.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.840
Please.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.720
Don't let me hold you up.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.240
Oh, thank you.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.320
So...

15:51.240 --> 15:53.120
Any luck with the gun?

15:53.160 --> 15:54.720
I've looked everywhere.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.800
The courtroom. The evidence store.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.720
The kitchen. The toilet.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.120
I even checked the judge's chamber.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.200
FLORENCE: These are all the photos

16:13.760 --> 16:16.200
from the journalist.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.800
There's Mae Harmer, Pastor Mason.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.600
The entire morning of the murder documented.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.080
Well, it's all here, Florence.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.120
Right in front of us for the taking.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.600


16:30.920 --> 16:32.680
-Dwayne. <i>-We've recovered the gun.</i>

16:32.720 --> 16:34.080
HUMPHREY: You have?

16:34.120 --> 16:35.200
<i>Where?</i>

16:35.240 --> 16:36.560
We found it in an air-conditioning unit,

16:36.600 --> 16:39.880
near the bench, just outside the courtroom.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.120
<i>Looks to me</i> <i>like a .22 calibre.</i>

16:42.160 --> 16:43.720
-Well done, Dwayne. <i>-Thank you, Chief!</i>

16:43.760 --> 16:45.280
Have it biked over to forensics,

16:45.320 --> 16:46.840
and see if it matches the bullet that killed Jack.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.760
I'm on my way. JP?

16:49.440 --> 16:50.640
An ale.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.440
What is it?

17:15.080 --> 17:16.840
PASTOR MASON: I'm not sure tying my shoelaces

17:16.880 --> 17:19.440
constitutes a crime, Inspector.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.280
Gosh, one would hope not. We'd never stop.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.520
No, I'm more interested in what's next to you.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.280
I'm not sure I understand.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.640
My officers recovered something

17:29.680 --> 17:31.200
from the courthouse.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.040
It was inside the air-conditioning unit.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.280
It was a gun. There's no-one else near you.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.080
Was it your gun?

17:39.120 --> 17:41.520
We can wait for the prints, should you prefer.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.080
You know, I've given my life

17:50.560 --> 17:54.080
to this church.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.440
I hear people's troubles each and every day.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.520
I never thought I would be on the other side.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.480
That man took her from me.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.160
Thirty-five years of marriage, gone.

18:11.160 --> 18:14.280
And though I preach forgiveness,

18:11.160 --> 18:14.280
Inspector,

18:14.320 --> 18:17.000
I could not find it in my heart

18:14.320 --> 18:17.000
to forgive him!

18:18.560 --> 18:20.200
How did you do it?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.160
Did you have a copy of the key?

18:24.200 --> 18:26.600
How did you get down there without being seen?

18:26.640 --> 18:28.320
You misunderstand. I didn't do anything.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.160
-It was never used.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.920
But I made the choice to hide the gun.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.120
I didn't fire it.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.280
I did not shoot Jack Harmer.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.720
I came to my senses.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.680
I knew it wouldn't bring her back.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.400
I still expect to see her.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.840
My Sabine.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.520
Sometimes, I think I do.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.280
In her chair,

18:59.680 --> 19:02.480
needlepoint in hand, stitching away.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.840
Contented.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.400
Sir, can I have a word?

19:11.680 --> 19:13.400
Excuse me, Pastor.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.800
That was the lab.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.480
They've done a preliminary residue test

19:20.520 --> 19:22.120
on the pastor's gun.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.800
They're absolutely certain it wasn't fired today.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.280
So it wasn't the murder weapon?

19:27.320 --> 19:28.800
No, it wasn't.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.000
DWAYNE: Okay, I understand. No, no, never mind.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.000
If you do hear anything, let me know.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.520
Okay.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.000
Anything I can do to help?

19:41.040 --> 19:43.240
No, I'm all good, thanks.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.640
Ah, Chief! How did it go?

19:44.680 --> 19:47.960
A broken man seeking revenge. But he failed to act.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.240
However, the pastor does have motive, bags of it.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.080
But not the means, nor opportunity,

19:50.280 --> 19:53.080
it would seem.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.080
Oh, yes, Chief.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.840
Something about no hot water?

19:56.880 --> 19:59.120
Okay, thank you. Any news on the green car?

19:59.160 --> 20:00.520
Nothing fitting that description

20:00.560 --> 20:02.600
has been bought or sold in the past three months.

20:02.640 --> 20:03.960
And from what I can make out,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.560
nothing like that has been stolen either.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.640
So...

20:08.680 --> 20:11.120
A man is shot dead, inside his locked cell,

20:11.160 --> 20:15.000
located within two additional locked security doors.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.440
There's no way the killer could have

20:16.480 --> 20:18.120
come in via the prisoner entrance,

20:18.160 --> 20:20.600
which can only be unlocked and opened from the inside.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.280
And to come from the courthouse entrance,

20:22.320 --> 20:24.640
the killer must have passed Dwayne and JP,

20:24.680 --> 20:26.520
unseen, unheard...

20:26.560 --> 20:28.040
Which they didn't.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.720
-Add to that... -A fire alarm.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.400
The speeding car.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.480
HUMPHREY: The missing murder weapon

20:31.440 --> 20:35.480
and a trail of ants.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.160
-Really.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.120
And we are no further ahead with this investigation

20:39.200 --> 20:43.120
than we were at the start.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.120
Actually, sir, I found something.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.240
I recovered this blue thread

20:46.280 --> 20:47.560
from the smashed fire alarm point.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.240
It was caught on the shattered glass,

20:49.280 --> 20:52.240
meaning it belonged to whoever it was that

20:49.280 --> 20:52.240
set the fire alarm off.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.560
Now, the only person wearing anything close

20:52.280 --> 20:55.560
to that colour is...

20:55.600 --> 20:57.800
Erol. His uniform.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.080
Well done, JP. Good work.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.600
See, this was found in the shattered glass

21:02.880 --> 21:05.600
of the fire alarm.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.400
It belongs to you.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.000
<i>It matches your uniform</i> <i>exactly.</i>

21:11.040 --> 21:12.200
<i>You set off that alarm.</i>

21:12.240 --> 21:13.720
<i>As you walked back</i> <i>from the kitchen,</i>

21:13.760 --> 21:15.320
<i></i>

21:15.360 --> 21:17.040
-That's the fire alarm!

21:17.080 --> 21:19.040
-We have to move the prisoner.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.600
Why?

21:22.080 --> 21:24.160
Look, last week,

21:24.200 --> 21:25.640
on my way back from work,

21:25.680 --> 21:27.840
this guy, you know, he approached me...

21:27.880 --> 21:29.560
<i>-I don't know.</i>

21:29.600 --> 21:31.920
<i>He had a local accent.</i> <i>I'd never seen him before,</i>

21:31.960 --> 21:35.360
<i>and he offered me money</i> <i>to set off the alarm.</i>

21:35.400 --> 21:37.360
<i>I thought he was joking.</i>

21:39.440 --> 21:40.800
I didn't know setting off the alarm

21:40.840 --> 21:43.360
would be a distraction for murder.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.520
-Um...

21:45.560 --> 21:46.720
He was my height.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.480
Dark hair, dark clothes.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.400
It was night!

21:52.440 --> 21:54.040
Everything happened so fast!

21:54.080 --> 21:56.640
And how do we know you're telling us the truth?

21:56.680 --> 21:59.000
You've lied to us once already.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.440
What did you do with this money, Erol?

22:08.880 --> 22:10.640
So, has anyone else approached you?

22:10.680 --> 22:11.720
No.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.640
Nothing.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.360
I know taking the money was wrong.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.240
And for that, I am sorry.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.960
HUMPHREY: So you should be.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.960
It's a serious crime,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.800
which we'll deal with once we've solved this murder.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.240
But, we'll get forensics on to this

22:24.280 --> 22:26.480
and start the search for your mystery man.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.240
Average height and build, dark clothes?

22:34.280 --> 22:36.080
That's not much to go on, Chief.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.880
-The envelope's clean.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.560
Whoever gave him the cash wore gloves.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.160
Or maybe it's another lie.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.960
Is it me, or are we going round in circles?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.120
Sir, it's getting late.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.440
Sorry?

22:50.480 --> 22:53.760
Shouldn't you be going home

22:53.800 --> 22:56.400
Yes, quite. Um, yes. Wow, um...

22:56.440 --> 22:58.240
You don't fancy joining us, do you?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.120
FLORENCE: As tempting as that is,

23:00.160 --> 23:02.000
I was thinking of heading

23:02.040 --> 23:04.040
to a service at the pastor's church.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.240
I have a few friends who attend,

23:05.280 --> 23:08.480
so I thought I'd do some digging around.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.200
Excellent. Bravo.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.480
Sir.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.960
He's made the effort to come all this way.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.840
So, great news about Oliver being made partner.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.680
Fantastic.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.880
And little William turning two, of course.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.600
I saw the photos.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.600
So, it's an interesting case we've been working on...

23:45.640 --> 23:48.320
We saw Sally a few weeks back.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.720
She was at a works do. Your mother and I were there.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.120
She was with Derek, her fiance.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.800
You remember Derek Grundy?

23:55.840 --> 23:58.600
That awful man, terrible lawyer?

23:58.640 --> 24:01.720
Sally spent the whole evening asking after you.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.640
I see.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.280
Is she well?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.280
Humphrey, she's going to marry this man

24:07.320 --> 24:09.240
she barely spoke to the entire evening

24:09.280 --> 24:11.880
because she spent it asking your mother about you.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.320
Your mother's done some digging.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.760
They're going to be married in...

24:15.800 --> 24:18.160
-Yes, yes, I am.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.240
You need to get home

24:20.280 --> 24:21.480
and tell her you made a terrible mistake

24:21.520 --> 24:23.240
and you want her back.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.800
-I'm afraid I can't do that. -Of course you can!

24:25.840 --> 24:27.400
You're fast approaching middle age.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.560
-You're single. -Divorced.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.920
And you're desperately unhappy.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.920
I'm not unhappy.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.360
How long is it before you grow up?

24:34.400 --> 24:36.320
Sally still loves you.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.360
You need to get home, pick up where you left off.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.280
Put an end to this protracted

24:41.320 --> 24:43.440
and, frankly, quite ridiculous gap year.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.680
But I am happy here.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.480
No, you're not. You think you are.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.880
You've been here so long,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.040
you've forgotten what the real world

24:47.920 --> 24:49.040
looks like.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.080
Look...

24:55.080 --> 24:57.120
-I should think so.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.000
HUMPHREY: Fresh towels in the bathroom,

25:05.080 --> 25:08.000
water in the fridge.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.600
Does it get any cooler than this?

25:09.640 --> 25:11.720
Yes... Not really, no.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.920
Right.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.600
Night.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.480
And you'll think about what I said regarding Sally?

25:17.520 --> 25:18.880
Of course.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.680
What have you done?

26:06.120 --> 26:07.560
Knock, knock.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.600
Dad, are you up?

26:49.720 --> 26:52.360
I'm sure he won't be too much longer.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.080
HUMPHREY: Morning, all!

26:58.120 --> 26:59.680
Sorry I'm late.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.800
A word, Inspector.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.640
Outside.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.280
I'm very disappointed.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.440
It was my assumption that you thrived on pressure.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.040
I do, sir, very much so.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.840
I mean, it's a complicated case,

27:22.080 --> 27:23.840
no doubt, but...

27:23.880 --> 27:26.840
I'm not talking about the case, Inspector.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.480
I'm talking about you.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.920
Right, I see.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.400
We're in the midst of a murder enquiry,

27:34.440 --> 27:38.400
our reputation's at stake and you want to up and leave?

27:38.440 --> 27:41.600
I don't want to leave. What makes you think that?

27:41.640 --> 27:43.640
According to your father, you're considering your pos...

27:43.680 --> 27:45.960
Sorry, what

27:46.000 --> 27:48.240
He came by my office first thing

27:48.280 --> 27:50.920
to ascertain how quickly you could be released

27:48.280 --> 27:50.920
from your contract.

27:52.440 --> 27:55.040
What situation?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.320
That you and your ex-wife

27:56.360 --> 27:57.680
are going to give things another go.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.280
We're what?

27:59.320 --> 28:00.600
Is that not the case?

28:00.640 --> 28:02.520
No, sir. It's most certainly

28:00.640 --> 28:02.520
not the case.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.240
I'm staying here.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.640
On this island.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.440
Solving this case.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.080
And that is a promise.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.600
-Absolutely.

28:22.640 --> 28:25.920
Sir, I had an e-mail back from border control in London.

28:25.960 --> 28:29.000
Their records show that Paul Harmer

28:25.960 --> 28:29.000
hasn't left the UK.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.240
We are still waiting to hear from parole for an address.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.680
Thank you.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.480
FLORENCE: And also, I made it to the church

28:32.720 --> 28:35.480
last night.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.920
A couple of my friends said that Sabine Mason

28:35.520 --> 28:38.920
had been seen at church

28:38.960 --> 28:41.400
less and less over the last couple of years.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.440
And some of them had even heard shouting

28:43.480 --> 28:45.720
before services between her and the pastor.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.320
Hmm. Doesn't quite fit with the image

28:47.360 --> 28:49.440
of domestic bliss he painted, does it?

28:49.480 --> 28:52.200
Chief, I've been working through Jack Harmer's

28:49.480 --> 28:52.200
financial statements

28:52.240 --> 28:55.000
and it turns out he signed a life insurance document

28:55.040 --> 28:56.560
two months before we arrested him.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.480
It gets better.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.800
Jack's personal effects arrived from the prison

29:00.520 --> 29:02.800
this morning.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.680
And I've found a handwritten letter

29:04.720 --> 29:07.320
from Mae to Jack whilst he was inside.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.960
And it reads, "I'm not getting rid of it.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.960
"I'm doing this with or without you."

29:13.000 --> 29:14.840
She's having a baby.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.360
So she's pregnant.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.360
And if the husband dies in jail,

29:18.400 --> 29:21.600
she gets the chance of a big pay out from

29:18.400 --> 29:21.600
the life insurance.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.200
-Now, that's a motive. -Yes.

29:23.240 --> 29:26.000
I think we should pay her a little visit, don't you?

29:29.160 --> 29:30.840
Jack has always been in trouble with the law

29:30.880 --> 29:33.480
for as long as I can remember.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.760
Whether it was here, or back home.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.560
I needed security.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.240
Because of your baby?

29:40.280 --> 29:41.640
How do you know that?

29:43.800 --> 29:46.000
My family is none of your business.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.200
HUMPHREY: So you both take out

29:46.040 --> 29:48.200
the life insurance.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.080
Innocent enough. Lots of people do.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.000
Jack is then arrested for murder

29:50.120 --> 29:53.000
and refused bail.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.480
During which time, you find out you're pregnant.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.200
So you write to him, he replies.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.600
"Now is not the time for bringing a baby

29:57.240 --> 29:59.600
into the world."

29:59.640 --> 30:01.040
You disagree.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.960
You're going to have this child

30:01.080 --> 30:02.960
with or without him.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.640
If you haven't got a warrant...

30:04.680 --> 30:06.120
The truth is,

30:06.160 --> 30:08.920
Jack is worth more to you dead

30:06.160 --> 30:08.920
than he is alive.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.040
Financial security assured.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.400
Answer me this, Inspector.

30:12.440 --> 30:15.840
If I did do it, how did I get down to his cell?

30:15.880 --> 30:18.600
How did I get past security, past you lot,

30:18.640 --> 30:22.520
shoot him, then leave, all without being seen?

30:24.800 --> 30:26.640
HUMPHREY: Just because I don't know how she did it,

30:26.680 --> 30:28.480
doesn't mean she didn't do it. Was it just me, or did Mae

30:33.960 --> 30:35.440
have an awful lot of groceries?

30:35.480 --> 30:37.720
That fridge was already overflowing.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.600
That's a lot of food for one single woman.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.600
Well, she is eating for two.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.080
-Exactly.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.720
So who's she harbouring?

30:45.760 --> 30:47.880
Could it be the man in the green car, maybe?

30:47.920 --> 30:49.640
Very possible.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.400
Dwayne, JP, maybe a little light surveillance

30:49.680 --> 30:52.400
might be in order.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.240
A stakeout? JP, we're undercover.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.240
Follow my lead.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.880
Call me if anything of interest happens.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.400
JP: Yes, Chief!

31:01.600 --> 31:04.360
-Oh, it's not over yet.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.480
Dinner with my father. Round two.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.960
How's the hotel?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.040
Air-conditioned.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.600
So. Um, yes. The thing is... Erm, er, there was something

31:24.640 --> 31:27.840
I wanted to say.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.640
Um, I, er... Well, the, er...

31:30.680 --> 31:32.520
Um...well, the pertinent point...

31:32.560 --> 31:34.840
Are you like this at work?

31:34.880 --> 31:36.440
It's enough to drive you mad all this

31:36.480 --> 31:38.480
umm-ing and ahh-ing all the time.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.360
Yes. Uh, indeed.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.320
So. Um, well, the Commissioner came to see me today.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.400
He said you enquired about my contract

31:47.440 --> 31:48.600
and whether or not I could return...

31:48.640 --> 31:51.360
Return home, yes. What of it?

31:51.400 --> 31:54.520
Well, don't you think it's a little, um, undermining?

31:55.520 --> 31:56.880
I simply met with the Commissioner

31:56.920 --> 31:58.720
to ascertain the terms of your contract.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.600
Yes, my contract. Not yours.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.840
It was a conversation, Humphrey,

32:02.880 --> 32:04.400
not a coup d'etat.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.400
And it was done for your benefit.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.560
-I mean, if you really can't see that...

32:09.600 --> 32:12.000
That you're living alone, in a shack,

32:12.040 --> 32:13.200
with a bloody lizard!

32:15.400 --> 32:17.720
You know what? I knew this was a bad idea.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.720
I should just go.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.080
Sit down!

32:20.960 --> 32:22.520
What's the point?

32:22.560 --> 32:24.280
Because whatever I say, you're always going

32:22.560 --> 32:24.280
to say the opposite,

32:24.320 --> 32:26.080
-and say I'm wrong. -Nonsense.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.120
I just think you're better than this, that's all.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.640
Better than what, exactly?

32:31.520 --> 32:34.240
This place. This job.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.680
These people!

32:40.000 --> 32:42.080
Now you're just being plain silly.

33:01.400 --> 33:06.880
Now, a stakeout usually involves an awful lot of

33:01.400 --> 33:06.880
sitting around and waiting.

33:06.920 --> 33:10.400
We should work out shifts, so we both get some shuteye.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.680
I really don't mind doing it on my own.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.960
No, no, no. You don't want to be doing

33:14.000 --> 33:15.600
a whole stakeout on your own.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.520
You could die of exhaustion!

33:19.640 --> 33:21.320
I'm not going to die of exhaustion.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.360
Really. I don't mind.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.520
Actually, I'd rather do it on my own.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.920
OK. So, tell me.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.840
I'm not an idiot, JP.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.880
I know when someone has an issue with me, you know.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.120
I just don't think our working methods

33:40.160 --> 33:42.200
are, you know, compatible.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.000
-Yes.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.520
It's like at the court yesterday.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.600
You wanted to go for a drink with Erol

33:48.640 --> 33:50.400
whilst I didn't think we had the time.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.600
And then the next thing, a prisoner has been shot.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.280
Ah! So you're saying it's my fault?

33:54.320 --> 33:56.680
No, no, no. I know it's not your fault.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.880
I'm not saying that at all.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.120
It's just,

34:00.160 --> 34:03.960
someone died in our custody. On my first murder trial.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.440
And what were we doing at the time?

34:05.480 --> 34:06.720
Waiting for rum.

34:09.200 --> 34:11.800
I just don't want to be that kind of officer.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.240
Obviously you don't think I take things

34:13.280 --> 34:14.720
as seriously as I should.

34:16.280 --> 34:19.680
But the way I do things, my way, I get results.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.520
I just thought that maybe together,

34:22.560 --> 34:24.120
we could make a good fit, you know?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.120
Well, maybe I was wrong.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.120
I'll leave you to your stakeout.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.000
-I'll see you tomorrow. -Mm.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.680
HUMPHREY: <i> Though we were</i> <i>never able to establish</i>

34:49.400 --> 34:51.680
<i>who sent that note...</i>

34:54.080 --> 34:56.680
<i>How did the killer</i> <i>make it to the cell?</i>

34:56.720 --> 34:57.960
There are ants.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.600
<i>This old green Citroen...</i>

34:59.640 --> 35:03.200
-DWAYNE: No, Chief.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.760
Humphrey! I'm busy.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.320
Was it really necessary of you

35:09.360 --> 35:12.160
to throw your toys out of the pram like that?

35:12.200 --> 35:13.880
I'm only trying to help.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.560
Help?

35:15.600 --> 35:18.360
Do you honestly believe that I'm going to drop everything,

35:18.400 --> 35:20.000
jump on the next plane home

35:20.040 --> 35:22.960
and attempt to sabotage the pending nuptials

35:20.040 --> 35:22.960
of my ex

35:23.000 --> 35:24.440
What planet do you live on?

35:24.480 --> 35:27.720
All we ask is that you take your life seriously.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.800
But instead you insist on this folly,

35:29.840 --> 35:31.680
of playing cops and robbers

35:31.720 --> 35:34.240
on some godforsaken island in the middle of nowhere.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.360
It isn't the middle of nowhere! I'm...

35:36.400 --> 35:39.240
-I am a DI. I'm a good detective.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.360
Why did a man die in your custody?

35:47.000 --> 35:50.320
I wanted so much more for you than this, Humphrey.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.480
I really did.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.280
I'm sorry that you think me such a failure, Dad.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.680
But I'm happier than I have ever been,

36:04.720 --> 36:06.240
living on this island, doing what I do.

36:06.280 --> 36:09.600
And if you can't see that, if you can't accept that,

36:10.840 --> 36:12.120
then...

36:15.360 --> 36:16.600
Have a safe flight back.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.840
Yeah! What time is it

36:44.880 --> 36:46.680
Almost eight, sir.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.880
-Yes, sir.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.200
No.

36:53.640 --> 36:54.760
Yes.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.000
-Yes.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.320
Did you sort things out with your father?

37:05.360 --> 37:07.800
Er, not exactly, no.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.920
-I'm sorry. -Thank you.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.480
Have you seen the front page?

37:17.240 --> 37:18.560
Oh, dear.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.920
We have Dwayne and JP on a stakeout as we speak, and,

38:15.960 --> 38:18.840
and, erm, here is a copy

38:18.880 --> 38:22.880
of the forensic report, and also, I found some ants.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.920
And this is as far as we've got in the last 48 hours?

38:26.520 --> 38:27.880
Nothing more?

38:27.920 --> 38:29.320
Well, sir, in some respects,

38:29.360 --> 38:31.760
progress has been slow, um, but in other respects,

38:31.800 --> 38:34.920
there has been much that we have been able to rule out.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.480
Saved by the bell. JP!

38:38.520 --> 38:39.960


38:40.000 --> 38:42.200
It looks like I've found that mysterious green car.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.000
Mae Harmer led me straight to it.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.200
Excellent. Where are you now?

38:45.240 --> 38:47.040
JP: <i> Erm, I'm just</i> <i>off the south road.</i>

38:47.080 --> 38:48.160
You know that abandoned house

38:48.200 --> 38:49.720
at the back of the old golf course?

38:49.760 --> 38:52.480
Yes, Mae Harmer's inside, and she's with someone.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.840
Don't move. We're on our way.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.440
Well, sir, seems it's suddenly all go!

38:58.480 --> 39:00.800
I'm thinking we might finally have a lead.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.000
Don't wait around for me.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.160
Of course not. Come on, Florence!

39:06.840 --> 39:08.640
HUMPHREY: So there's JP. Where's Dwayne?

39:22.720 --> 39:25.040
JP, hang back here. Florence, around the back.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.360
Mrs Harmer It's the police.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.600
Open up! It's the police.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.200
Chief!

39:43.320 --> 39:44.360
Chief!

39:45.800 --> 39:48.120
-FLORENCE: Police! Stop! Police!

39:45.800 --> 39:48.120
-PAUL: Oi!

39:48.160 --> 39:50.560
Get off me! Get off of me!

39:50.600 --> 39:53.640
Get off of me! Get off of me!

39:55.880 --> 39:57.040
Dwayne.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.240
-Paul Harmer.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.280
Hello, Paul.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.640
JP: I thought you'd gone!

40:05.680 --> 40:07.880
I wasn't going to leave you on your own, now, was I?

40:07.920 --> 40:09.680
You were there the whole night

40:09.720 --> 40:11.560
I might've dozed off a couple of times.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.160
But, yes, I was there.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.440
We're partners, JP. I wasn't going to abandon you.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.920
Is he talking?

40:21.960 --> 40:25.240
Nothing. But we did find a fake passport.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.120
That explains why border control

40:25.280 --> 40:28.120
didn't pick him up.

40:28.160 --> 40:31.280
Which begs the question, what are you doing here, Paul?

40:31.320 --> 40:34.040
-I want to see Mae. -This was a revenge killing.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.320
Payback for the fact that your brother stole your fiancee.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.160
All the other suspects were in the courthouse

40:38.200 --> 40:39.320
at the time of the killing, Paul,

40:39.360 --> 40:40.680
it all points to you.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.440
-You killed your brother. -No!

40:42.480 --> 40:45.000
-To get him out!

40:47.000 --> 40:48.040
How?

40:50.280 --> 40:52.520
If you want to see Mae, you need to start talking.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.600
She called me a few weeks back to say she was pregnant.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.160
Jack had told her about some plan to escape.

41:02.640 --> 41:05.360
Jack needed a getaway driver, someone he could trust.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.040
I told Paul a time and a place to be,

41:08.080 --> 41:09.960
and that's where he was.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.960
I didn't know the details, just that I was to

41:10.000 --> 41:12.960
be there waiting.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.240
The plan was to meet Jack at the marina

41:14.280 --> 41:16.280
and then we'd leave together.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.000
Paul had no idea about any of this.

41:18.800 --> 41:22.040
I did it for Mae, not him.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.320
PAUL: <i> But the time came</i> <i>and went.</i>

41:25.360 --> 41:26.440
<i>And when the alarm kept going,</i>

41:26.480 --> 41:28.200
<i>a cop came out</i> <i>and I drove off.</i>

41:28.920 --> 41:30.280
Hey! Hey! Stop!

41:32.720 --> 41:34.400
Did you see anyone enter or leave

41:34.440 --> 41:36.200
the prisoner entrance when you were in the car?

41:37.920 --> 41:39.120
No one.

41:42.720 --> 41:43.800
If Paul is telling the truth

41:43.840 --> 41:46.080
and he didn't see anyone enter or leave

41:46.120 --> 41:47.520
via the prisoner entrance,

41:47.560 --> 41:50.160
then the killer must, absolutely must,

41:50.200 --> 41:51.840
have come down the stairs from the courthouse.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.880
No, no, no. No way.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.680
HUMPHREY: So we're back to square one.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.600
Nothing about this case makes sense.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.040
How could someone have killed him inside that cell,

41:57.640 --> 42:01.040
behind three locked doors?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.320
It's not possible.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.280
We've got a murder but no murder weapon.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.920
DWAYNE: Yes, and motives but no evidence.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.520
FLORENCE: And no leads.

42:07.560 --> 42:10.400
If Paul didn't kill Jack Harmer, who did?

42:10.440 --> 42:13.640
And who paid Erol to set off the fire alarm?

42:13.680 --> 42:15.600
FLORENCE: All we have is questions.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.320
-Got it! -Dwayne!

42:19.360 --> 42:23.640
Sorry, Chief. Ah! Look, don't worry.

42:19.360 --> 42:23.640
He's still alive.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.640
Yes, of course!

42:39.560 --> 42:40.600
Yes!

42:41.800 --> 42:43.840
Jack had told her about some plan to escape.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.360
Yes.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.720
FLORENCE: You know who the murderer is?

42:52.440 --> 42:54.760
I've got a fairly good idea, Florence.

42:54.800 --> 42:58.680
I'm going to need your help, Dwayne. Let's go.

42:58.720 --> 43:01.000
I want someone to bring me a bottle of tomato ketchup.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.280
The squirty kind!

43:06.720 --> 43:09.840
Got it! Got it.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.200
Let's go and find out what it's for.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.280
Excuse me, um...

43:15.960 --> 43:19.560
-Florence. My name is Florence.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.040
I realised I still have his key.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.480
You've just missed him.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.080
He's on his way to the courthouse.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.840
Oh, well, would you give him this?

43:25.880 --> 43:27.400
I...I'm due at the airport.

43:27.440 --> 43:30.840
He should only be half an hour or so.

43:27.440 --> 43:30.840
You can catch him there.

43:30.880 --> 43:33.040
Half an hour... Well.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.600
-Fine. -Oh. Thank you.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.000
Excuse me. Mr Goodman?

43:41.200 --> 43:43.000
I know we don't really know each other.

43:43.040 --> 43:46.120
But for what it's worth, your son

43:46.160 --> 43:48.880
is the most generous, kind,

43:48.920 --> 43:52.640
unintentionally funny man I know.

43:52.680 --> 43:56.120
And he also happens to be a brilliant detective.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.120
I just wanted to say that.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.400
I'm not questioning your diligence in the slightest.

44:15.440 --> 44:16.560
But now that I'm finally

44:16.600 --> 44:18.440
getting some clarity on this case,

44:18.480 --> 44:20.040
we may have been looking at things

44:20.080 --> 44:21.560
through the wrong lens. Ah!

44:22.200 --> 44:23.520
The evidence log.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.720
Bear with me, Dwayne.

44:27.760 --> 44:30.040
All will become clear very shortly.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.880
This case was, for a short while,

44:41.920 --> 44:44.120
seemingly unsolvable.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.440
How could Jack Harmer possibly have been murdered

44:46.480 --> 44:48.720
inside a locked cell,

44:48.760 --> 44:51.880
located within two additional locked security doors,

44:51.920 --> 44:55.240
and all within the space of six short minutes?

44:55.280 --> 44:58.920
The prisoners' entrance can only be unlocked

44:55.280 --> 44:58.920
and opened from the inside

44:58.960 --> 45:00.720
and my officers didn't see anyone approach

45:00.760 --> 45:02.480
from the courthouse entrance.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.280
It all made little sense. We know Jack died from a

45:05.320 --> 45:08.080
single gunshot wound to the chest.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.800
A .22 calibre pistol.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.320
So where was the gun?

45:12.360 --> 45:15.240
And what did all this have to do with a

45:12.360 --> 45:15.240
rogue fire alarm

45:15.280 --> 45:17.880
and a mysterious green car?

45:17.920 --> 45:20.320
A case of many questions but few answers.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.000
Until now.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.560
Isn't that right, Mae?

45:26.480 --> 45:28.960
You conspired with your ex-fiance, Paul,

45:29.000 --> 45:30.880
to break your husband out of jail.

45:30.920 --> 45:32.360
You did so because you were desperate

45:32.400 --> 45:35.240
to have your baby grow up with a father in their life.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.720
Which brings us to you, Paul Harmer.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.160
You flew all the way here,

45:40.200 --> 45:42.400
on licence and a fake passport,

45:42.440 --> 45:46.480
to act as the getaway driver for your brother,

45:46.520 --> 45:49.200
the very same brother who ran off with your fiance.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.640
Pastor Mason.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.840
A revenge attack on the man who killed your wife?

45:54.880 --> 45:56.240
That was certainly your plan.

45:56.280 --> 45:59.360
But you bottled it and someone beat you to it. But who?

46:01.200 --> 46:02.360
And how?

46:04.960 --> 46:06.280
And why?

46:07.440 --> 46:09.440
For starters, perhaps I should clear up

46:09.480 --> 46:10.880
a misconception, an inaccuracy.

46:11.880 --> 46:14.440
Jack Harmer wasn't murdered at all.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.960
Jack's alive?

46:17.000 --> 46:19.640
Jack is very, very dead.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.240
Now.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.200
But...

46:27.000 --> 46:29.040
Oh...gosh, um, um...

46:30.520 --> 46:34.160
When my officers initially discovered the body,

46:34.200 --> 46:37.400
your husband was very much alive.

46:34.200 --> 46:37.400
As alive as you or I.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.280
JP: But he was dead.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.840
Me and Dwayne saw him. We saw the blood.

46:42.880 --> 46:45.040
Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit A.

46:46.480 --> 46:49.800
It was all a ruse. A ploy.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.560
An attempt to fake his own death

46:51.600 --> 46:53.880
in order to escape justice.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.240
The plan was deceptively simple.

46:56.320 --> 46:58.160
Play dead,

46:58.200 --> 47:00.600
and then, at the first opportune moment,

47:00.640 --> 47:02.480
make off in the getaway car.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.880
Paul would then drive Jack to the marina,

47:06.360 --> 47:10.480
husband and wife would sail off into the sunset.

47:10.520 --> 47:11.800
But what you didn't know was,

47:13.480 --> 47:16.040
who on earth was helping Jack on the inside?

47:22.320 --> 47:24.440
-You.

47:24.480 --> 47:28.080
Erol Dumas and Jack Harmer. An unlikely pairing.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.280
Although, perhaps not that unlikely,

47:29.320 --> 47:30.400
given the circumstances,

47:30.440 --> 47:31.640
because you'd already met.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.640
On the day of Jack Harmer's pre-trial hearing.

47:36.680 --> 47:40.520
HUMPHREY: <i> D'you know</i> <i>what I think happened?</i>

47:36.680 --> 47:40.520
<i>Jack reached out.</i>

47:43.360 --> 47:45.440
HUMPHREY: <i> He needed help</i> <i>to break out and</i>

47:43.360 --> 47:45.440
<i>offered money.</i>

47:46.680 --> 47:48.480
<i>And that's where</i> <i>your cash came from.</i>

47:48.520 --> 47:51.960
<i>You weren't being paid</i> <i>to set off the fire alarm,</i>

47:52.000 --> 47:55.080
<i>you were being paid</i> <i>to get him out of jail free.</i>

47:56.960 --> 48:00.320
And from thereon in, you planned the great escape.

48:03.040 --> 48:06.000
HUMPHREY: <i> And on the morning</i> <i>of the murder, I wager</i>

48:03.040 --> 48:06.000
<i>that you escorted Jack</i>

48:06.040 --> 48:07.440
<i>into the cell,</i>

48:07.480 --> 48:09.880
<i>secretly slipping him</i> <i>a small bag of fake blood.</i>

48:12.600 --> 48:14.680
<i>And then all he had to do</i> <i>was play the part.</i>

48:16.560 --> 48:18.720
<i>Jack Harmer</i> <i>waited inside that cell.</i>

48:20.040 --> 48:21.760
<i>And when the alarm sounded,</i>

48:25.040 --> 48:26.400
<i>he burst the bag.</i>

48:28.000 --> 48:29.200
<i>Simple.</i>

48:29.960 --> 48:31.200
<i>Effective.</i> <i>Deceptive.</i>

48:36.280 --> 48:37.480
He's dead!

48:37.520 --> 48:40.160
HUMPHREY: <i> But he wasn't dead,</i> <i>was he?</i>

48:40.200 --> 48:42.760
<i>He was laying in wait</i> <i>for his chance to escape.</i>

48:44.320 --> 48:45.880
This is just nonsense.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.560
And the plan was for Jack to rise from the dead.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.920
He'd then appear to overpower you

48:50.960 --> 48:52.480
and flee to the waiting car,

48:52.520 --> 48:54.280
to the marina, to freedom.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.720
But you didn't quite follow the plan, did you, Erol?

49:00.080 --> 49:01.880
Why?

49:01.920 --> 49:04.160
Because you, more than anyone, wanted him dead.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.440
And you guaranteed that you were going to have time alone

49:08.480 --> 49:10.120
with Jack Harmer to kill him...

49:10.160 --> 49:11.760
Someone must have got in.

49:11.800 --> 49:14.400
HUMPHREY: <i> ...by ensuring</i> <i>you dispatched my officers.</i>

49:14.440 --> 49:15.960
-EROL: They can't have got far.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.960
-Right. Keys.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.120
JP, check the prisoner entrance. Erol, you stay here.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.880
HUMPHREY: <i> As soon as they</i> <i>were both out of sight</i>

49:21.920 --> 49:23.960
<i>and Jack miraculously rose,</i> <i>you shot him.</i>

49:27.680 --> 49:32.560
<i>A few short seconds</i> <i>was all you needed.</i>

49:27.680 --> 49:32.560
<i>Silencer attached, job done.</i>

49:32.600 --> 49:36.360
HUMPHREY: Lock down the entire courthouse.

49:32.600 --> 49:36.360
Nobody leaves. Nobody enters.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.480
<i>And by this point</i> <i>he really was dead.</i>

49:36.400 --> 49:39.480
<i>I checked that myself.</i>

49:42.840 --> 49:45.360
Why would I go to all that trouble, huh?

49:45.400 --> 49:47.080
Why would I kill Jack Harmer?

49:47.120 --> 49:51.080
All in good time, Erol, all in good time.

49:51.120 --> 49:54.360
But first, the murder weapon. Where was it?

49:54.400 --> 49:56.160
Now, we know that you had to have got rid of the gun

49:56.200 --> 49:57.480
after the shooting

49:57.520 --> 49:59.200
but before you were searched by Dwayne.

50:00.480 --> 50:03.040
So you couldn't have gone far.

50:03.080 --> 50:06.680
And although Officer Myers scoured the bins

50:03.080 --> 50:06.680
and each of the boxes,

50:06.720 --> 50:09.720
he had no reason to search individual evidence bags.

50:09.760 --> 50:13.720
Why would he? They were sealed

50:09.760 --> 50:13.720
and accounted for.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.400
But that is precisely where

50:15.440 --> 50:18.280
you hid the gun in plain sight.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.720
As a piece of evidence in another trial.

50:20.760 --> 50:24.320
Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit B.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.840
Case number 1043.

50:27.880 --> 50:32.560
Which is odd because, according to the evidence log,

50:32.600 --> 50:35.640
case 1043 didn't involve any firearm whatsoever.

50:41.400 --> 50:43.200
A .22 calibre pistol.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.000
A silencer.

50:47.960 --> 50:50.080
And the remains of the bag of blood.

50:52.320 --> 50:53.800
Now, I was, um...

50:53.840 --> 50:56.480
fairly big on the am-dram scene

50:53.840 --> 50:56.480
back at school.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.920
So if I'm not mistaken...

51:03.280 --> 51:06.080
Ah, yes. Glucose syrup.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.840
HUMPHREY: <i> A sweet,</i> <i>sugary substance.</i>

51:08.880 --> 51:10.720
<i>That is why the ants</i> <i>came to play.</i>

51:12.080 --> 51:14.480
So, we have a how.

51:15.840 --> 51:16.840
We have a who.

51:18.160 --> 51:21.120
But why, why,

51:22.080 --> 51:23.120
why?

51:25.800 --> 51:28.920
The question I struggled with. What connects Erol Dumas

51:28.960 --> 51:32.080
to the original murder?

51:32.120 --> 51:36.280
What connects Erol Dumas to Sabine Mason

51:37.760 --> 51:41.960
Well, first of all, there had been, um...rumours

51:42.000 --> 51:44.440
that Sabine Mason had drifted from the church.

51:44.480 --> 51:49.320
Sabine Mason had been seen at church less and less

51:44.480 --> 51:49.320
over the last couple of years.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.640
That perhaps she wasn't as happy at home

51:49.360 --> 51:51.640
as she once had been.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.080
And then I thought,

51:55.120 --> 51:57.560
what if she turned to someone in her hour of need?

51:58.720 --> 52:00.280
Perhaps there was a man.

52:01.880 --> 52:03.240
That's it.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.400
There was another man.

52:07.440 --> 52:10.320
And then I remembered something Florence

52:07.440 --> 52:10.320
told me about you, Erol.

52:10.360 --> 52:13.040
Dwayne said he used to be a bit of a ladies' man,

52:13.080 --> 52:15.800
but seemed to calm down a few years ago.

52:15.840 --> 52:19.280
A one

52:19.320 --> 52:21.600
Because you'd met Sabine Mason.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.680
It was the needlepoint that gave you away, Erol.

52:23.720 --> 52:26.680
Needlepoint in hand, stitching away.

52:26.720 --> 52:27.960
PASTOR MASON: <i> I know</i> <i>taking the money was...</i>

52:28.000 --> 52:29.880
HUMPHREY: <i> Needlepoint</i> <i>that gave you away.</i>

52:31.560 --> 52:34.200
<i>"The heart sees what is</i> <i>invisible to the eye."</i>

52:35.040 --> 52:36.800
But I can see, Erol.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.800
What self-respecting 52-year-old man

52:38.840 --> 52:40.880
has a needlepoint canvas in their home?

52:42.680 --> 52:46.800
HUMPHREY: <i> A 52</i>

52:46.840 --> 52:50.280
<i>Because that is where you</i> <i>used to meet. The marina.</i>

52:50.320 --> 52:54.280
<i>Moonlit walks.</i> <i>Perhaps even a picnic.</i>

52:54.320 --> 52:56.440
<i>You'd been seeing each other</i> <i>for years.</i>

53:02.640 --> 53:04.680
HUMPHREY: <i>'Cause you were there.</i>

53:04.720 --> 53:06.320
That night Sabine Mason was shot dead, you were going

53:06.360 --> 53:07.480
to meet her.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.240
Just another assignation? If only it was.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.840
Ah, Dwayne, right on cue.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.600
And where did you find this?

53:15.640 --> 53:16.800
-Erol's office. -Ah!

53:18.720 --> 53:20.520
Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit C.

53:21.640 --> 53:22.800
If I'm not mistaken,

53:22.840 --> 53:24.640
this typewriter will prove your guilt.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.440
You'll notice that the letter E

53:32.480 --> 53:35.560
sits lower than the rest of the letters.

53:35.600 --> 53:38.240
The same as the anonymous letter

53:35.600 --> 53:38.240
implicating Jack Harmer

53:38.280 --> 53:40.360
in the murder of Sabine Mason.

53:40.400 --> 53:43.640
You were the one who sent the anonymous note.

53:43.680 --> 53:46.560
You witnessed Sabine Mason,

53:46.600 --> 53:47.880
the woman you were in love with,

53:47.920 --> 53:49.760
murdered in cold blood by Jack Harmer.

53:49.800 --> 53:50.920
But you couldn't come forward.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.520
You couldn't risk exposing your affair,

53:52.560 --> 53:54.320
not with the pastor's wife!

54:00.880 --> 54:02.520
So you sent an anonymous note

54:02.560 --> 54:04.680
implicating Jack Harmer in her murder.

54:11.760 --> 54:14.600
Fate delivered you the man who killed the love of your life.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.120
Very nearly the perfect murder, Erol.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.640
Very nearly the perfect murder.

54:25.280 --> 54:26.280
Take him away.

54:33.920 --> 54:36.120
Sir, that was...

54:36.160 --> 54:38.400
Very impressive, Inspector.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.200
I never doubted you for a second.

55:14.120 --> 55:15.640
JP: Sorry, man. DWAYNE: Ow!

55:15.680 --> 55:17.960
JP: Yes, this is the man that saved my life!

55:18.000 --> 55:20.400
But that's what we do, man, 'cause we are partners.

55:20.440 --> 55:21.760
Yes, we know, you keep saying.

55:21.800 --> 55:24.320
-Mm, mm! Yes, sir! -Ow!

55:24.360 --> 55:25.960
No more beer for you, JP.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.240
What

55:28.280 --> 55:30.720
Come on, you've had too much. Let's find you a chair.

55:32.720 --> 55:33.960
Are you all right?

55:34.000 --> 55:36.080
What? Yes. Of course. Absolutely marvellous.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.800
Quite a result, really.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.680
I meant about your father.

55:40.720 --> 55:44.000
Oh, yes. That's fine. Entirely expected.

55:44.040 --> 55:46.440
We bid our adieus last night.

55:46.480 --> 55:49.320
-BOTH: It's your round, Chief!

55:52.440 --> 55:54.760
Oh, er, right.

55:54.800 --> 55:56.640
If you'll excuse me, I'd better...

55:59.360 --> 56:01.800
Dad, what are you doing here

56:01.840 --> 56:03.600
I thought I ought to say goodbye properly.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.800
I see.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.840
Well, there wasn't really any need, but, er...

56:08.880 --> 56:11.080
Look, it was good to see you.

56:11.120 --> 56:14.280
Humphrey, I, I wanted to say...

56:11.120 --> 56:14.280
I, erm, er...

56:14.320 --> 56:15.600
What?

56:15.640 --> 56:18.840
To say that, that... What I wanted to say was, I...

56:18.880 --> 56:20.200
Now you know where I get it from.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.360
What I wanted to say was that

56:24.400 --> 56:27.240
that was really something earlier today,

56:27.280 --> 56:28.560
at the courthouse. Really something.

56:32.720 --> 56:36.280
Frankly, I... I'm proud of you, son.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.880
Gosh! Well, that's...

56:42.520 --> 56:44.040
Thank you, Dad.

56:50.720 --> 56:52.560
And, er, I was thinking,

56:52.600 --> 56:56.040
your mother would rather like it out here.

56:56.080 --> 56:59.640
A chance to swim in warmer waters.

56:59.680 --> 57:02.680
So maybe we could both come out together

56:59.680 --> 57:02.680
next time and see you?

57:03.560 --> 57:04.840
Yes, I'd like that.

57:09.360 --> 57:10.800
Good to see you, son.

57:18.920 --> 57:20.040
Good to see you, too.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.040
Bye, Dad.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.760
-Never better, Florence.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.760
Never better.

57:49.560 --> 57:52.120
I think JP is drunk.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.040
He's insisting we dance.

57:54.080 --> 57:57.200
Oh, dear. Then I'm afraid there's only one thing for it.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.480
Go and join him?

57:58.520 --> 58:00.080
Got it in one, Detective Sergeant.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.920
Got it in one. Come on.

58:02.840 --> 58:04.040
Whoa!
