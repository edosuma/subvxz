[chuckling]

00:10.878 --> 00:13.979
Looking good,
students.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.548
Ciara, let's see if
you can demonstrate

00:16.650 --> 00:18.517
a double-arrow shot.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.853
She double-can.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.654
I don't know if
that makes sense,

00:22.757 --> 00:24.089
but I'm rooting
for you.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.392
Thanks.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.260
Here goes nothing.

00:28.362 --> 00:32.064
[dramatic music]

00:32.165 --> 00:33.966
- [arrow thuds]
- Hey!

00:34.068 --> 00:36.001
I can't afford
to lose any more eyes.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.838
That's awesome...

00:39.940 --> 00:42.341
If you're trying
to get worse.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.511
Congratulations
on your decline.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.013
Students,
put your weapons away.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.315
You can mark the hour
on your own time.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.654
Hey, are you okay?

00:55.756 --> 00:56.889
I mean, archery is
usually your thing...

00:56.991 --> 01:00.692
Kind of how like not playing
the ukulele is my thing.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.194
It's just so tiny.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.765
I haven't had enough
time to practice

01:06.867 --> 01:08.200
because of all
my princess duties.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.536
Yeah, but you got
to judge that bake-off.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.737
Free pie, blue ribbons.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.872
Get out of
my dreams, lady.

01:14.775 --> 01:15.941
If this keeps up,

01:16.043 --> 01:17.876
I'll never get good enough
to become a knight.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.478
I'm not even
good enough

01:19.580 --> 01:21.180
to fight
an army of balloons.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.714
Don't get down,
all right?

01:22.817 --> 01:23.916
Your life is
complicated,

01:24.018 --> 01:25.184
but you always
find the answer...

01:25.286 --> 01:27.453
Usually with my help,
after some shenanigans.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.388
[laughs]

01:29.490 --> 01:30.756
Students!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.324
You've all been
working so hard

01:32.426 --> 01:33.325
that you deserve
a treat.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.626
[chuckles]

01:34.728 --> 01:35.861
So, I'm taking
you on a quest

01:35.963 --> 01:38.430
to find treasure at
the Treasure Trove Caverns.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.531
- Yeah!
- Yay!

01:39.633 --> 01:41.366
Aw. I can't go.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.735
Now I have
princess stuff to do.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.637
My life would just
be so much easier

01:45.739 --> 01:46.872
if my dad would let
me go to knight school.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.474
And I wouldn't
have to constantly

01:48.576 --> 01:50.075
make up excuses
to cover for you...

01:50.177 --> 01:51.076
Like this one.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.744
Sir Gareth,
Ciara just got stung

01:52.847 --> 01:54.413
by a red-nosed scorpion.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.615
Ow!

01:56.717 --> 02:00.919
Ow! Stupid
red-nosed scorpion.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.355
Oooh... its bite
makes your butt

02:03.457 --> 02:05.357
swell up to the size
of a beach ball.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.360
That's my third-
favorite animal.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.794
Her first
is a baby otter.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.630
But she doesn't
like people to know that.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.365
SAGE:
[clears throat]

02:13.467 --> 02:14.633
I'm sorry, Ciara,

02:14.735 --> 02:16.401
but you're going to
have to miss the quest

02:16.504 --> 02:18.103
and get to
the nurse's shack.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.671
- ARC: Ahhh...
- Run!

02:19.773 --> 02:21.140
Well, don't
literally run.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.242
The scorpion's venom will
move faster through your body.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.079
Well, go faster
than that!

02:27.181 --> 02:28.947
You just got stung
by a scorpion!

02:30.484 --> 02:31.416
[magic whooshing]

02:33.654 --> 02:35.220
Isn't this
great, Princess,

02:35.322 --> 02:36.221
connecting
to our people

02:36.323 --> 02:39.158
through the power
of waves.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.860
I love the King
and Princess Waving Hour,

02:41.962 --> 02:43.595
but we could do it
in half the time,

02:43.697 --> 02:46.265
of we switched
to double waving.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.033
Why are you
in such a hurry?

02:48.135 --> 02:49.768
I just think there
are more important things

02:49.870 --> 02:51.270
a princess could be
doing for the kingdom.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.338
Oh, the people enjoy
it as much as we do,

02:53.440 --> 02:54.873
and we can scan
the courtyard

02:54.975 --> 02:56.308
for new food carts.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.212
Those look delicious!

03:00.314 --> 03:02.447
Guard, find the cart that
makes those lamb chops.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.118
What I'm trying
to say is

03:06.220 --> 03:07.452
you should let me
go to knight school.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.788
Oh, you know
the answer is no.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.256
And here's a "no" for
the next six times you ask.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.926
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

03:15.062 --> 03:16.495
Would it change
your mind if you knew

03:16.597 --> 03:17.829
I was the greatest
warrior in Astoria?

03:17.932 --> 03:20.199
I refuse to have
this conversation again.

03:20.301 --> 03:23.202
Guard, bring me
my crown of silence!

03:27.908 --> 03:29.841
[shouting] With your
sister Eliza away,

03:29.944 --> 03:31.777
you have
a responsibility

03:31.879 --> 03:33.946
to the kingdom
to stay safe!

03:35.282 --> 03:37.583
This really works!
I can't hear myself!

03:37.685 --> 03:38.984
Ahhhh!

03:39.086 --> 03:40.052
Ahhhh!

03:40.154 --> 03:41.086
Ahhhh!

03:41.188 --> 03:42.354
Ahhhh!

03:46.026 --> 03:47.492
Ah, Your Highness,

03:47.595 --> 03:50.062
we have returned from
the Treasure Trove Caverns.

03:50.164 --> 03:51.697
Who wants to
see some treasure?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.198
I do! I do!

03:53.300 --> 03:54.900
All the bling...

03:55.002 --> 03:57.069
that's fit
for the king!

03:57.171 --> 03:58.804
Or princess!

04:00.608 --> 04:01.907
Thank you.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.010
Nothing excites me more
than your generous gift of...

04:05.112 --> 04:06.345
Lamp chops!!

04:08.616 --> 04:10.949
Princess, I've got my treasure.
What would you like?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.484
I won't want treasure.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.052
I want to go
to knight school and...

04:14.154 --> 04:16.721
You're wearing
the crown of silence again.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.856
[shouting]
What?!

04:17.958 --> 04:19.224
I can't hear you!

04:19.326 --> 04:23.862
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

04:24.965 --> 04:26.398
[magic whooshing]

04:26.500 --> 04:29.034
Back to your
home, Sparkles.

04:31.238 --> 04:34.373
Yes, I'll wear you
tomorrow, Dazzle.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.409
Are you talking
to your tiaras again?

04:37.511 --> 04:38.844
No.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.213
We'll talk more later.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.383
I told you not to use
my secret passage.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.452
You also told me to stop
using your snack catapult.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.722
[laughs]
Pigs in a blanket!

04:50.824 --> 04:51.957
What?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.493
Why are you here?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.361
Because I found
this bottle

04:56.463 --> 04:59.031
at the Treasure Trove
Caverns to cheer you up.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.134
Open it! Open it!

05:03.804 --> 05:05.537
[magic whooshing]

05:05.639 --> 05:07.939
It's genie time!

05:10.077 --> 05:12.010
- You're a genie?
- Yeah, she is.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.780
And she is gonna
grant you three wishes.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.181
You bet I am.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.650
First, I'm gonna celebrate
being outta that bottle.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.452
So much space!

05:22.690 --> 05:24.456
I'm stretchin'.
I'm kickin'.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.191
Look at me go!

05:26.293 --> 05:28.927
Arc, you found
an actual genie.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.430
There haven't been genies
in Astoria for centuries.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.566
Yeah-h-h-h?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.668
I mean, huh-h-h-h-h?

So, you're really here
to grant my wishes?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.467
I grant the wishes of whoever
possesses the bottle.

06:08.569 --> 06:12.537
Again, I feel like I have
to say huh-h-h-h-h-h?

06:13.607 --> 06:14.773
You get three wishes.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.441
But, first,
we need to go over

06:16.543 --> 06:18.110
the Genie Wish Rules.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.079
Number One:
Nothing about wars.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.481
Can't start 'em,
can't end 'em.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.849
Number Two:
Nothing about love.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.550
You've gotta figure that
one out for yourself.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.552
And Number Three: You can't
wish for more wishes.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.521
I know you
were thinking it.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.358
She's right.
I was thinking that.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.160
This is a good genie.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.962
Yeah, she is.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.864
And if you wanna fix
your problem with your dad,

06:38.966 --> 06:40.766
just ask this
magical motor mouth.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.134
Yes, what's the problem
with your dad?

06:42.236 --> 06:43.635
Ooh, if he's a big
booger head,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.104
I could literally turn him
into a big booger head.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.073
Oh? No!

06:48.175 --> 06:49.674
My dad's wonderful...

06:49.777 --> 06:51.643
Except he won't let me
go to knight school,

06:51.745 --> 06:55.046
so, I created Ciara,
my secret identity.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.481
Secret identity?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.750
So, you've had other
genies before me?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.521
That's really cool.
No bigs.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.457
[deep sigh]
Oh...

07:05.559 --> 07:06.858
Don't cry.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.261
A pixie gave me
a magic ring.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.695
A pixie?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.465
Pfffft! Well,
there's your problem.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.201
My motto is: If you want
your wish to come true,

07:16.303 --> 07:18.537
don't be a wienie,
use a genie!

07:20.441 --> 07:22.073
You heard her.
Make your wish, wienie.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.341
[laughs]

07:23.444 --> 07:25.644
Okay, here goes.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.146
I wish my dad would let
me go to knight school.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.015
Your wish
is my command.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.951
Hey, I could also say,
whatever ya wish, dude!

07:33.053 --> 07:35.353
Do you like it?
I'm trying it out.

07:35.456 --> 07:38.023
What about
wika-wika, wish it up!

07:40.260 --> 07:42.027
Just spitballin'.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.930
If you just do it,
he'll stop talking.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.264
Okay.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.532
[snaps fingers]

07:47.634 --> 07:48.667
[magic whooshing]

07:48.769 --> 07:50.969
What just happened?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.904
You're not
wearing your ring.

07:53.006 --> 07:53.839
Your wish worked.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.707
- Yep.
- ARC & CIARA: Ahhhh!

07:56.543 --> 07:58.109
Is that how you
guys say hello?

07:58.212 --> 07:59.344
It's fun.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.046
Ahhhh!

08:02.349 --> 08:05.016
Anyway, your father now allows
you to go to knight school,

08:05.118 --> 08:07.719
so, yay, me, makin'
dreams come true!

08:08.989 --> 08:10.689
But if I'm allowed
to go to knight school,

08:10.791 --> 08:11.990
why am I still Ciara?

08:12.092 --> 08:13.959
Oh, yeah, your Ciara
hair was just too gorg,

08:14.061 --> 08:16.061
so, I went with
the full Ciara package.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.364
Hey, guys, did you hear
about the new ranking?

08:19.466 --> 08:21.099
- Phoenix Squad is on top.
- [laughs]

08:21.201 --> 08:22.067
Again.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.269
And we set the record
for most points.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.737
Again.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.839
So, we're ahead
of Kraken Squad?

08:27.941 --> 08:29.674
[laughs]
Kraken Squad?

08:29.776 --> 08:31.009
There is no
Kraken Squad.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.912
We just have Phoenix,
Unicorn, and Sloth Squad.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.951
No Kraken
means no Sage.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.087
Kiki, you are way
better than a pixie.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.688
Aw, thanks.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.857
And you are way better
than a flying cockroach.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.826
That's what
I call pixies.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.395
Oh, Ciara,
will you demonstrate

08:50.497 --> 08:53.365
a quadruple-
arrow shot.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.233
Are you kidding?

08:55.335 --> 08:56.968
That'll be easy
for Ciara.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.371
Right. So easy.

08:59.473 --> 09:00.739
Yes, of course.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.804
to get that bottle back
from Princess Sage.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.205
- Oh, no can do.
- What?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.308
Hey, genie, how
about a giant hug?

19:04.410 --> 19:07.278
Ooh, yay. I've always
wanted to try a hug.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.947
[electrical zapping]

19:10.049 --> 19:12.150
Oh! Hugs are not
what I expected!

19:12.252 --> 19:13.584
What are you
doing to my genie?

19:13.686 --> 19:15.052
[electrical zapping
continues]

19:15.155 --> 19:17.221
Cannot summon
genie magic.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.725
Come on, bro.
We need you.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.093
Hey, maybe Princess Sage
will like you

19:22.195 --> 19:23.661
because you're a...

19:23.763 --> 19:25.229
rebel bad boy.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.465
- I'll do it!
- ARC: [snaps fingers]

19:30.103 --> 19:31.402
Bottle-us,
comesy-heresy!

19:34.007 --> 19:36.274
Yes! I've got
the bottle!

19:36.376 --> 19:38.409
And I'm a bad boy.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.411
How do ya
like me now?

19:41.447 --> 19:42.813
I like you less.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.284
I made
a terrible mistake!

19:47.954 --> 19:49.453
Genie, stop them!

19:49.556 --> 19:52.490
You no longer have
the bottle, so, no.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.995
Guards,
seize that bottle!

20:00.266 --> 20:01.465
Hurry up!
Make a wish!

20:01.568 --> 20:03.167
I wish everything
was back to normal!

20:03.269 --> 20:04.869
Wika-wika,
wish it up!

20:04.971 --> 20:06.204
BOTH:
Just do it!

20:06.306 --> 20:07.939
- [fingers snapping]
- [magic whooshing]

20:09.175 --> 20:12.777
Nothing excites me more
than your generous gift of...

20:12.879 --> 20:14.011
Lamb chops!!

20:16.382 --> 20:19.750
I'm the princess!
And you're the king!

20:19.852 --> 20:22.153
And Sage is just regular
knight school Sage!

20:22.255 --> 20:24.188
[laughing]

20:24.290 --> 20:26.057
Okay.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.293
Hey, show some respect
to the girl I love,

20:29.395 --> 20:31.562
but I'm too scared
to talk to.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.465
Oooh!

20:35.468 --> 20:37.535
Look, Sage, I found
a pretty bottle.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.870
No! You cannot
have that!

20:42.642 --> 20:46.444
B-Because the princess
probably wants it.

20:46.546 --> 20:50.314
I do. Thank you,
random knight school student.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.683
Well, you know
the rules.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.619
Since the king doesn't
want anything, let's...

20:54.721 --> 20:56.220
go throw this
in a ditch.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.990
Yes! And I know
just the ditch.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.966
Ah! Happy to be back
in your complicated life?

21:09.068 --> 21:11.502
Yes, everything
is perfect.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.503
Thank you for
teaching me

21:12.605 --> 21:14.438
I can't wish
my problems away.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.173
Hey, you still have
one wish left.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.542
Oh, talking
alpacas, please!

21:20.079 --> 21:22.446
Actually, I gift my
last wish to you, Kiki.

21:22.548 --> 21:23.914
KIKI:
[gasps]

21:24.017 --> 21:25.182
What?

21:25.285 --> 21:27.151
You're gonna give
your last wish

21:27.253 --> 21:28.552
to the bathroom genie?

21:28.655 --> 21:30.454
I'm so sorry.
Please, don't kick me.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.557
I don't need
any more wishes.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.426
I wouldn't change
a thing.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.562
No way! No way!
No way! No way! No way!

21:38.665 --> 21:40.998
I know exactly
what I want.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.233
[sighs]

21:42.335 --> 21:43.968
[snaps fingers]

21:46.606 --> 21:48.639
A slightly
bigger bottle.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.710
[snaps fingers]

21:54.547 --> 21:56.547
KIKI: Ha, ha, there's
so much space in here!
