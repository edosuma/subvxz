00:01.140 --> 00:03.434
Previously, on "11.22.63"...

00:03.435 --> 00:05.446
I have something to say!

00:05.447 --> 00:07.262
I'll fucking kill you.

00:07.263 --> 00:10.277
On November 12th, I
delivered to you a document

00:10.278 --> 00:12.494
of the utmost importance
for Agent Hosty.

00:12.495 --> 00:13.615
I remembered everything.

00:13.616 --> 00:15.782
This is dangerous, what I'm going to do.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.510
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to kill Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:18.511 --> 00:20.271
It might be better if you guys go.

00:20.272 --> 00:21.624
Why did you do this to me?

00:21.625 --> 00:23.616
Bill!

00:23.617 --> 00:25.548
President's gonna drive right by.

00:25.549 --> 00:27.530
We gotta go.

00:27.531 --> 00:29.195
The past is pushing back.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.492
I'm gonna jumpstart it.

00:44.550 --> 00:46.591
- Look out!
- Oh!

00:46.592 --> 00:48.882
Jake, all of Dallas is
gonna be closed down.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.054
We just need to get closer.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.022
Move!

01:04.110 --> 01:06.042
- Watch it on the right.
- Jesus!

01:10.938 --> 01:12.940
Watch it.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.287
Watch out!

01:29.228 --> 01:31.360
No, no, no! This road is not closed.

01:31.361 --> 01:32.361
It's supposed to be clear.

01:33.906 --> 01:35.272
We can't turn around.

01:37.507 --> 01:39.889
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, my God.

01:39.890 --> 01:41.302
All right, come on. We can't stop.

01:41.649 --> 01:42.839
How do you know he's in the building?

01:42.840 --> 01:45.662
'Cause Lee goes to the Texas
School Book Depository

01:45.663 --> 01:46.793
with a rifle under his arm.

01:46.794 --> 01:49.439
A guy that works there,
named Bonnie Ray, saw him.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.669
He's gonna set up a shooter's
nest on the sixth floor.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.333
The first shot goes off at 12:30.

01:54.334 --> 01:56.077
It misses. The next two don't.

01:56.078 --> 01:57.687
Can we get there by 12:30?

01:58.697 --> 02:01.212
Come on. We have to get there by 12:30.

02:01.213 --> 02:02.729
Excuse us.

02:02.730 --> 02:04.823
Stay with me no matter what.

02:06.646 --> 02:07.706
Sorry, sorry. Excuse me.

02:07.707 --> 02:08.937
- Kennedy!
- Hey, watch it.

02:11.691 --> 02:13.822
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

02:21.672 --> 02:23.235
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:36.879 --> 02:38.841
Sadie!

02:39.842 --> 02:41.783
Sadie!

02:45.928 --> 02:47.909
Sadie!

02:47.910 --> 02:49.741
- Oh.
- Hello, there.

02:49.742 --> 02:50.963
Oh!

02:50.964 --> 02:52.985
Sadie... Sadie, come on.

02:54.868 --> 02:56.949
You all right?

02:56.950 --> 02:58.761
Oh, Jake.

02:58.762 --> 02:59.943
You all right?

02:59.944 --> 03:01.995
Yeah.

03:01.996 --> 03:03.967
Hey, you all right?

03:03.968 --> 03:06.454
Yeah, yeah, come on. Let's go.

03:07.712 --> 03:08.972
All right, come on. This way.

03:08.973 --> 03:11.735
All right.

03:11.736 --> 03:13.566
Oh, shit.

03:14.740 --> 03:15.950
All right, come on.
Dealey Plaza's this way.

03:15.951 --> 03:17.772
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

03:17.773 --> 03:18.933
I've been studying this for three years.

03:18.934 --> 03:19.984
All right. Come on.

03:35.012 --> 03:37.964
Oh, my God!

03:37.965 --> 03:40.651
Stay with me. Run!

03:40.652 --> 03:41.790
Watch out.

03:57.045 --> 03:58.847
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

03:58.848 --> 04:00.008
All right. Come on.

04:05.775 --> 04:07.816
- You folks all right?
- We caused this?

04:07.817 --> 04:10.789
No, no, it's the past.
It's trying to stop us.

04:10.790 --> 04:12.135
All right, we gotta go.

04:13.804 --> 04:14.804
Just stay back.

04:32.905 --> 04:33.905
Sorry.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.967
Man!

04:52.085 --> 04:54.016
Come on.

04:58.042 --> 05:00.934
Wait, wait, Bonnie Ray!

05:00.935 --> 05:02.906
- Wait. Wait, Bon...
- How do you know my name?

05:02.907 --> 05:04.888
We just... we need a minute, okay?

05:04.889 --> 05:06.130
Mr. Maynard, uh, is in there.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.002
- We need to get inside.
- I don't know you, sir.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.924
Mr. Maynard told me to close
the building up at lunch.

05:09.925 --> 05:11.075
No, no, no, no, you're
not supposed to close.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.478
You're supposed to stay open today.

05:13.479 --> 05:14.440
That's what's supposed to happen.

05:14.441 --> 05:15.576
Sorry, sir, I need to go.

05:15.577 --> 05:18.446
Look, did Lee Harvey
Oswald come to work today?

05:18.447 --> 05:19.934
- Yes, but I don...
- Okay, is he in there

05:19.935 --> 05:21.126
- on the sixth floor?
- I don't know.

05:21.127 --> 05:22.998
- You do know.
- Jake...

05:22.999 --> 05:24.910
You do know... you testified
for the Warren Commission.

05:24.911 --> 05:26.091
- You know!
- Testified? Let me go.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.953
- I haven't done anything.
- Sadie, something's wrong.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.095
- Jake!
- Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!

05:29.096 --> 05:30.937
Shh, shh, shh. Something's wrong.

05:30.938 --> 05:32.098
He's supposed to know about this, okay?

05:32.099 --> 05:35.973
The past is changing things,
and anything can happen.

<font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:37.856 --> 06:39.695
They will know your name.

06:41.965 --> 06:43.035
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.685
I just need you to do what I say.

06:44.686 --> 06:47.509
You need to unlock that door right now.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.403
That's all I need. Okay?

06:49.404 --> 06:51.777
Lee Harvey Oswald is on the sixth floor.

06:51.778 --> 06:52.968
He's gonna try and kill the President.

06:52.969 --> 06:56.207
I need you to get the police
and bring them here right now.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.179
Okay? Go on, get the police.

06:58.180 --> 07:00.331
Go. All right.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.383
Let's go. Come on.

07:09.242 --> 07:11.164
Come on.

07:42.448 --> 07:45.410
Oh, no... no. Come on.

08:20.469 --> 08:22.330
This doesn't go the sixth floor.

08:22.331 --> 08:24.473
This way. There'll be
stairs on the other side.

08:47.529 --> 08:49.470
What time is it?

08:49.471 --> 08:52.284
- 12:29.
- Okay.

09:23.488 --> 09:25.469
This is it.

09:25.470 --> 09:26.570
- It's stuck.
- Oh!

09:26.571 --> 09:27.571
Come on.

09:48.525 --> 09:49.929
Sharpshooter.

09:54.846 --> 09:55.876
Lee!

09:56.878 --> 09:58.809
Lee, stop!

09:58.810 --> 10:00.921
Stop!

10:00.922 --> 10:02.723
Watch out.

10:09.001 --> 10:10.752
Aah!

10:16.910 --> 10:20.032
Lancer is safe. I
repeat, Lancer is safe.

10:21.945 --> 10:24.747
It came from the Depository!

11:18.937 --> 11:20.397
They got away.

11:20.398 --> 11:21.370
Why?

11:21.879 --> 11:23.841
What are you doing here, God damn it?

11:36.846 --> 11:37.947
Sadie...

11:37.948 --> 11:40.529
I need you to stay here, okay?

11:40.530 --> 11:42.790
Please, just stay here.

11:42.791 --> 11:44.883
Don't move. Okay?

12:01.689 --> 12:02.894
Lee,

12:03.402 --> 12:04.570
put your gun down.

12:05.330 --> 12:06.661
I don't wanna hurt you.

12:18.151 --> 12:20.082
Fuck you!

12:20.083 --> 12:21.244
Fuck you!

12:22.968 --> 12:25.089
I came here to do something!

12:25.090 --> 12:27.023
Something important!

12:27.024 --> 12:29.026
You know what kind of potential I have?

12:29.027 --> 12:31.660
I can do anything that I set my mind to.

12:31.661 --> 12:32.993
I know, Lee.

12:35.586 --> 12:37.175
You don't have to shoot anyone.

12:37.659 --> 12:38.956
You don't have to do this.

12:48.661 --> 12:49.891
You don't know that.

12:55.688 --> 12:56.947
You don't know me.

12:57.691 --> 13:00.654
I'm gonna make my mark on this world.

13:16.731 --> 13:18.328
You don't know me.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.536
Nobody knows me.

13:40.335 --> 13:42.306
Lee, get back! Lee!

14:01.914 --> 14:03.902
- Sadie!
- Jake?

14:07.485 --> 14:09.299
Oh, my God.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.903
Oh, my God.

14:10.904 --> 14:13.926
Okay, all right, just stay still, okay?

14:13.927 --> 14:16.008
Is the president safe?

14:18.022 --> 14:19.923
Yeah.

14:19.924 --> 14:21.845
So we did it?

14:21.846 --> 14:22.876
Mm-hmm.

14:22.877 --> 14:25.829
Now, listen, you just hold right there,

14:25.830 --> 14:27.811
- and I'm gonna go get some help.
- No. No.

14:27.812 --> 14:29.883
Yes, please, let me go get some help.

14:29.884 --> 14:31.455
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.015
Can you just hold my hand?

14:38.003 --> 14:39.396
Okay.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.058
Okay, I'm right here.

14:42.829 --> 14:44.186
Are you holding my hand?

14:47.984 --> 14:49.383
I'm holding your hand.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.237
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

14:55.002 --> 14:56.114
I'm staying right here,

14:56.864 --> 14:58.825
and you stay right here, too, okay?

14:58.826 --> 15:00.612
I told you we could do it.

15:08.426 --> 15:09.639
Sadie...

15:10.232 --> 15:11.425
Sadie...

15:13.504 --> 15:15.270
Sadie, I'm supposed to be with you.

15:16.348 --> 15:17.649
That's why I'm here.

15:19.007 --> 15:21.584
Sadie, that's why I'm here.
That's why I came back.

15:21.585 --> 15:23.020
Sadie, please.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.353
I know.

15:25.354 --> 15:27.318
Sadie, please.

15:27.319 --> 15:28.666
Sadie!

15:30.911 --> 15:31.921
Sadie!

15:32.922 --> 15:35.013
- This is the police.
- Sadie, please!

15:35.014 --> 15:37.056
We have a body over here.

15:37.057 --> 15:38.410
Put up your hands!

15:38.929 --> 15:41.922
Put up your hands! Put up your hands!

15:41.923 --> 15:44.560
I wanna see your goddamn hands, boy!

15:45.056 --> 15:46.348
Go on, now. Cuff him.

15:46.822 --> 15:47.936
Can you help her?

15:48.392 --> 15:49.470
Please?

15:50.856 --> 15:51.831
Please!

15:52.495 --> 15:53.614
Please!

15:55.845 --> 15:56.946
Help her!

15:56.947 --> 15:58.406
Come on, now.

15:58.407 --> 16:00.836
Goddammit, will you just help her?

16:12.183 --> 16:15.375
- You're going away for a long time, boy.
- Long time?

16:15.376 --> 16:17.263
Old Sparky waiting for you.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.212
Can you both please shut up?

16:22.493 --> 16:23.634
Ow.

16:24.343 --> 16:25.436
Ow.

16:25.437 --> 16:28.255
It's too bad you banged your
head on that door frame, son.

16:36.459 --> 16:38.400
Whoa, whoa, wait! Boys...
boys come on now.

16:38.401 --> 16:39.501
Back it up. Back it up.

16:39.502 --> 16:41.403
- Back it way up.
- Come on.

16:41.404 --> 16:42.664
There's no room here,
boys. Come on, now.

16:42.665 --> 16:44.556
Back it up. Stand back, now.

16:55.619 --> 16:58.622
- Do you know he's the shooter?
- Come on, everybody, get back.

16:58.623 --> 17:00.504
Are you a member of the Communist Party?

17:00.505 --> 17:03.488
Did you kill the girl?

17:13.559 --> 17:15.650
Out of the way here.
Come on, now, fellas.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.587
Take off your shirt.

17:31.588 --> 17:32.649
Why?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.680
Need to check the blood
type for evidence.

18:13.305 --> 18:14.794
I'm Captain Fritz.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.658
This is Agent Hosty.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.091
What's your name, son?

18:22.524 --> 18:23.594
You know my name.

18:23.595 --> 18:26.035
Why don't you tell us yourself,
just for the record?

18:27.669 --> 18:29.113
Jake Amberson.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.642
You know, these are
pretty uncomfortable.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.659
We can put those in front.

18:39.195 --> 18:40.784
Mr. Amberson,

18:41.326 --> 18:42.665
can you explain what you were doing

18:42.666 --> 18:46.329
at the Texas School
Book Depository today?

18:46.330 --> 18:48.780
And don't leave out the
part about the dead girl

18:48.781 --> 18:50.509
and the dead fella.

18:56.123 --> 18:57.968
Lee Harvey Oswald,

18:58.939 --> 19:01.326
the man whose body you
found on the sixth floor,

19:02.095 --> 19:04.527
was attempting to kill
President Kennedy.

19:05.359 --> 19:06.618
How'd you know that?

19:06.619 --> 19:08.151
He told me.

19:08.876 --> 19:11.301
Lee lived in the apartment above mine.

19:11.696 --> 19:13.736
Two days ago, I heard him yelling,

19:14.732 --> 19:16.822
"The FBI isn't gonna mess with me.

19:17.448 --> 19:18.987
I'm gonna show them,"

19:19.905 --> 19:20.775
and then he came downstairs.

19:20.776 --> 19:22.266
He hammered on my door,

19:22.903 --> 19:26.290
and he said, "I'm gonna show
everyone what I can do.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.835
I'm going to kill the president."

19:29.287 --> 19:30.610
What did you say?

19:31.813 --> 19:33.147
I said, "You're drunk."

19:33.968 --> 19:35.682
I didn't believe he was serious,

19:35.683 --> 19:37.399
and then, when I woke up this morning,

19:37.400 --> 19:39.349
I couldn't get it out of my head.

19:39.350 --> 19:41.728
I knew that Kennedy was in town,

19:42.601 --> 19:44.842
and I had this bad feeling, so...

19:45.373 --> 19:47.737
I went to where I knew Lee worked.

19:49.123 --> 19:51.669
I guess I... I hoped that I could

19:51.670 --> 19:53.622
talk him out of doing something stupid.

19:53.623 --> 19:55.674
Mm, let me see if I got this right.

19:55.675 --> 19:57.766
Your neighbor told you he was
gonna kill the President.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.243
You and your girl follow him
to work to talk him out of it,

20:01.244 --> 20:02.549
and now he's dead.

20:02.550 --> 20:04.200
I realize it sounds crazy.

20:04.201 --> 20:05.805
It sounds more like horseshit.

20:06.410 --> 20:08.854
Your fingerprints are
all over that rifle.

20:08.855 --> 20:10.740
We know that Oswald ordered that rifle

20:10.741 --> 20:12.652
under the name Alek Hidell.

20:12.653 --> 20:13.743
Now, that's your real name, isn't it?

20:13.744 --> 20:15.876
No, and you're not gonna railroad me

20:15.877 --> 20:17.688
into some bullshit confession.

20:17.689 --> 20:20.483
Son, I'm Dallas police.

20:21.299 --> 20:23.226
I don't have to railroad anybody.

20:26.719 --> 20:28.585
Why didn't you stop Oswald?

20:29.867 --> 20:31.248
That was your job.

20:38.678 --> 20:39.702
Excuse us.

20:39.703 --> 20:42.435
- Hosty, this is my jurisdiction.
- I'm gonna need the room.

20:42.931 --> 20:44.103
Now.

20:48.692 --> 20:49.639
All right.

21:12.891 --> 21:15.697
Is there anything that you'd
like to tell me, Mr. Amberson...

21:18.725 --> 21:20.479
Or is it Mr. Epping?

21:31.039 --> 21:33.780
I went there to stop Oswald
because he was attempting...

21:33.781 --> 21:34.967
No, no, no, no.

21:35.864 --> 21:37.153
I heard that.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.859
We can speak freely now.

21:41.021 --> 21:42.112
What does that mean?

21:42.113 --> 21:44.548
I want the name of your handler.

21:45.386 --> 21:46.895
Give up the man who put you in play

21:46.896 --> 21:49.898
and I can get you out
of the spot you're in.

21:49.899 --> 21:51.930
I don't have a handler. I'm not a spy.

21:51.931 --> 21:53.163
Jake,

21:55.299 --> 21:57.076
false identity,

21:57.767 --> 22:00.950
two houses in different
cities minutes apart,

22:01.673 --> 22:03.728
a partner who you call your brother,

22:03.729 --> 22:05.642
who isn't, who committed suicide

22:05.643 --> 22:08.173
after you put him away
under a false name,

22:08.174 --> 22:10.406
a murder in Jodie...

22:10.407 --> 22:12.158
This girl's husband...

22:12.159 --> 22:13.339
Her name was Sadie.

22:13.340 --> 22:14.474
Right.

22:15.820 --> 22:18.852
Should I, uh, proceed to the part

22:18.853 --> 22:21.799
where you have no identity at all

22:22.548 --> 22:24.598
prior to 1960?

22:29.946 --> 22:31.877
Should I proceed to the part

22:31.878 --> 22:34.155
where your superior's gonna come in here

22:34.852 --> 22:36.953
and tell you to burn that letter

22:36.954 --> 22:39.609
that Oswald wrote to you two days ago?

22:41.919 --> 22:43.425
And what did it say?

22:44.373 --> 22:47.224
That he was gonna do something
to change the world?

22:47.985 --> 22:51.057
The FBI gets crazy letters every day.

22:51.058 --> 22:53.961
No, you're covering your ass

22:54.449 --> 22:56.874
because Kennedy was
almost shot in the street

22:56.875 --> 22:58.450
on Hoover's watch,

22:59.112 --> 23:01.080
and you should've known about it.

23:03.923 --> 23:05.275
Or did you know about it,

23:05.895 --> 23:07.737
and you just didn't take it seriously?

23:08.768 --> 23:09.970
Is that what happened?

23:12.481 --> 23:14.072
That's a nice theory.

23:15.596 --> 23:16.681
Try this one on.

23:17.421 --> 23:20.009
Jake Amberson, Lee Harvey Oswald,

23:20.010 --> 23:21.181
and Sadie Dunhill.

23:21.182 --> 23:23.063
Three Russian-sponsored assassins

23:23.064 --> 23:25.896
living in the same Dallas
apartment building

23:25.897 --> 23:27.067
are called to action the day

23:27.068 --> 23:29.920
Kennedy's motorcade route is announced.

23:29.921 --> 23:32.153
An FBI sharpshooter stops the attack.

23:32.154 --> 23:34.005
In the ensuing confusion,

23:34.006 --> 23:35.967
two of the Russian spies are killed,

23:35.968 --> 23:39.130
but one remains to stand trial.

23:39.131 --> 23:40.625
That's you,

23:41.245 --> 23:43.347
Mr. Amberson... Epping.

23:43.957 --> 23:45.968
Doesn't even make sense.

23:45.969 --> 23:48.000
Oswald was killed with his own rifle.

23:48.001 --> 23:50.983
Oh, I'm not gonna let a
little thing like ballistics

23:50.984 --> 23:52.500
get in the way of the truth.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.008
People love JFK.

23:57.688 --> 23:59.953
The American people need to know

23:59.954 --> 24:00.972
who to blame.

24:01.956 --> 24:03.366
It's an easy conviction.

24:04.029 --> 24:05.009
Mm.

24:06.379 --> 24:07.919
Talk about blame...

24:09.330 --> 24:13.067
You put me on the stand, I'm
gonna talk about Oswald

24:13.068 --> 24:15.039
and the FBI.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.211
I'll give 'em some details

24:16.212 --> 24:19.927
about Hoover's surveillance of JFK

24:19.928 --> 24:21.986
and his mob mistress.

24:21.987 --> 24:25.585
Then we could go on to
Marilyn Monroe and Bobby.

24:26.249 --> 24:28.911
I mean, you are spying on
Robert Kennedy, right?

24:29.534 --> 24:32.000
You are not making this any easier.

24:32.537 --> 24:33.499
Look at me.

24:33.991 --> 24:37.013
I didn't try to kill the President.

24:37.515 --> 24:39.777
I know. I don't care.

24:41.671 --> 24:43.049
Agent Hosty.

24:44.863 --> 24:47.234
- Sir...
- Is that your superior?

24:47.829 --> 24:48.966
Right on time.

24:52.170 --> 24:55.053
Under no circumstance

24:55.054 --> 24:59.107
is that letter to ever see daylight.

24:59.108 --> 25:00.229
You understand?

25:00.230 --> 25:02.231
You burn it.

25:05.827 --> 25:08.220
Are you clear on how you are to proceed?

25:10.516 --> 25:11.609
Yes, sir.

25:13.836 --> 25:14.900
Good.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.796
Who are you?

25:27.628 --> 25:29.099
And what do you want?

25:32.214 --> 25:34.331
All I wanted to do

25:35.749 --> 25:37.178
was save Kennedy.

25:37.179 --> 25:39.041
Y'all fall back.

25:39.042 --> 25:40.801
Mr. Amberson has no comment.

25:42.829 --> 25:44.014
Hosty,

25:45.819 --> 25:47.452
this is my jurisdiction.

25:47.961 --> 25:49.213
Not anymore.

25:50.044 --> 25:51.144
You think the feds are gonna tell me

25:51.145 --> 25:52.933
how to direct due process?

25:54.318 --> 25:57.894
- Get the hell out of here!
- Captain... sir,

25:57.895 --> 25:59.770
there's a telephone
call for Mr. Amberson.

25:59.771 --> 26:01.135
I don't give a good goddamn

26:01.136 --> 26:03.025
about a phone call for Mr. Amberson.

26:03.026 --> 26:05.851
I don't care if it's the
President of the United States.

26:12.553 --> 26:14.491
Shut those goddamn blinds.

26:22.452 --> 26:25.242
- Hello?
- Hold for the President.

26:28.105 --> 26:29.265
Mr. Amberson,

26:29.266 --> 26:30.881
Jack Kennedy here.

26:31.893 --> 26:34.251
The Secret Service tells me that, uh,

26:34.252 --> 26:38.385
my wife and I, uh, owe you our lives.

26:39.446 --> 26:40.266
Thank you.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.117
You're welcome, sir.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.371
The First Lady would
like to speak with you.

26:44.372 --> 26:45.503
All right.

26:47.613 --> 26:50.218
- Mr. Amberson?
- Yes, ma'am.

26:50.219 --> 26:52.223
I don't know how to say this,

26:52.224 --> 26:54.252
but I had a feeling that

26:54.253 --> 26:57.406
something terrible
could've happened today.

26:58.313 --> 27:00.624
Thanks to you, it didn't.

27:01.558 --> 27:03.989
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

27:04.505 --> 27:07.006
I know that you lost your fiancée.

27:07.745 --> 27:09.450
I'm so sorry.

27:10.291 --> 27:11.401
Thank you.

27:11.873 --> 27:13.133
God bless you.

27:30.413 --> 27:34.346
Lee Harvey Oswald's plans were
interrupted by the selfless...

27:37.170 --> 27:39.183
I can see the headlines now.

27:39.184 --> 27:41.784
"Teacher Kills Spy, Saves Kennedy."

27:41.785 --> 27:45.667
American hero has requested
to remain anonymous.

27:45.668 --> 27:49.874
In the resulting altercation,
Oswald was killed by his own...

27:51.616 --> 27:54.230
So...

27:54.750 --> 27:57.720
Why do you think Oswald
wanted to kill JFK?

27:58.674 --> 28:01.897
He loved Castro or he was
working for the Russians?

28:04.276 --> 28:05.851
No one will ever know,

28:05.852 --> 28:06.939
I don't think.

28:08.508 --> 28:10.310
How'd you know about the letter?

28:12.525 --> 28:15.541
- Did you burn it?
- I'll tell you if you tell me.

28:18.916 --> 28:21.448
Something off about you, Amberson.

28:22.216 --> 28:23.889
You save the President's life and...

28:23.890 --> 28:25.852
Poof...

28:25.853 --> 28:27.895
You walk into that bus station

28:27.896 --> 28:29.324
and disappear.

28:30.662 --> 28:33.132
- I like privacy.
- Mm.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.695
Far be it for me to pull the thread

28:37.696 --> 28:38.937
on the story of a hero.

28:38.938 --> 28:41.620
If I did, the whole thing would unravel.

28:43.373 --> 28:46.054
God knows this country wants a hero.

28:48.357 --> 28:49.754
An American hero

28:50.659 --> 28:52.499
who saved the President's life

28:53.493 --> 28:55.139
and values his privacy.

28:59.202 --> 29:01.431
That's how our story's gonna go.

29:05.331 --> 29:06.530
Amberson...

29:08.116 --> 29:09.780
sorry about your girl.

29:39.935 --> 29:43.456
Chaos reigned in Dallas today
when a man aimed and shot

29:43.457 --> 29:46.489
at President Kennedy during a
motorcade through Dealey Plaza.

29:48.643 --> 29:50.654
Shots fired!

29:51.369 --> 29:54.438
The assassination attempt was
recorded by a local citizen,

29:54.439 --> 29:56.961
who at this time has been unidentified.

29:57.711 --> 30:00.635
The suspected assassin is
one Lee Harvey Oswald.

30:00.636 --> 30:03.698
Reporters spoke to his
mother, Marguerite Oswald,

30:03.699 --> 30:05.754
at her home in Dallas.

30:05.755 --> 30:09.644
Lee Harvey Oswald, my son,

30:10.121 --> 30:11.970
even after his death,

30:12.499 --> 30:15.061
has done more for his country

30:15.062 --> 30:17.522
than any other living human being.

30:17.523 --> 30:19.485
Mrs. Oswald, was your son a Communist?

30:19.486 --> 30:21.076
Crazy day, huh?

30:21.508 --> 30:22.669
Where y'all headed?

30:23.175 --> 30:24.487
Lisbon, Maine.

30:24.488 --> 30:25.787
Five bucks.

33:09.036 --> 33:10.453
I'll fix this, Sadie.

33:15.891 --> 33:17.089
I'll be right back.

33:30.706 --> 33:32.844
What happened to the fucking diner?

34:19.013 --> 34:23.257
Excuse me. Uh, sorry to bother you,

34:24.054 --> 34:25.259
but what... what year is it?

34:26.167 --> 34:27.527
2016.

34:28.156 --> 34:29.993
And... and what happened to Al's Diner?

34:30.779 --> 34:33.292
- It... it used to be right there.
- I don't know.

35:49.865 --> 35:53.017
Hey, don't mess with
me, you little fucks.

36:21.538 --> 36:22.676
Come on.

36:32.759 --> 36:34.102
Is this where you live?

36:34.523 --> 36:35.668
Yeah.

36:37.085 --> 36:38.601
Does anyone else live here?

36:39.018 --> 36:40.093
Nope.

37:20.033 --> 37:21.471
Where'd you come from?

37:24.251 --> 37:25.480
Texas.

37:27.951 --> 37:29.589
Want a drink, Texas?

37:30.854 --> 37:31.808
Sure.

37:47.963 --> 37:49.744
Oh...

37:50.658 --> 37:51.872
Whoo.

37:54.792 --> 37:55.647
Strong.

37:59.767 --> 38:00.975
That your family?

38:02.002 --> 38:03.518
I think you know.

38:06.989 --> 38:08.029
What do you mean?

38:09.439 --> 38:10.946
You came back.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.366
It was you who saved me and my family

38:15.199 --> 38:16.874
in 1960.

38:18.140 --> 38:19.624
You killed my dad.

38:21.003 --> 38:22.912
I remember you.

38:30.150 --> 38:31.642
I knew I'd see you again.

38:32.726 --> 38:34.915
I thought you'd be fucking old.

38:38.278 --> 38:39.656
You an angel?

38:41.295 --> 38:43.833
No. No.

38:43.834 --> 38:47.426
I just... when did... When
did everything change?

38:51.429 --> 38:53.221
Just answer me... answer me one thing.

38:53.222 --> 38:54.065
What...

38:54.651 --> 38:57.359
Was John F. Kennedy reelected

38:57.360 --> 38:59.844
in 1964?

39:01.126 --> 39:03.004
What the fuck you want to
know about Kennedy for?

39:03.005 --> 39:04.682
I just do.

39:06.551 --> 39:10.079
He was president two
times before Wallace.

39:10.925 --> 39:12.045
Wallace?

39:12.657 --> 39:14.461
George Wallace was President?

39:16.551 --> 39:18.512
What... what about Vietnam?

39:19.591 --> 39:22.460
- Was there a Vietnam War?
- No.

39:22.898 --> 39:23.858
And Robert Kennedy,

39:23.859 --> 39:26.246
was he... was he killed in 1968?

39:27.467 --> 39:28.960
I don't think so.

39:31.397 --> 39:32.886
9/11.

39:34.123 --> 39:35.925
Does that mean anything to you?

39:40.016 --> 39:42.137
What did Kennedy do
when he was president?

39:42.138 --> 39:44.030
Anything good?

39:48.203 --> 39:51.076
Oh, you talking about the camps?

39:51.077 --> 39:52.695
The camps?

39:52.696 --> 39:55.558
I took my mama and my brother and sister

39:55.559 --> 39:59.046
to a Kennedy refugee camp

39:59.594 --> 40:01.151
back in '75.

40:02.050 --> 40:03.140
After the first bombings,

40:03.141 --> 40:05.665
we didn't have no place else to go.

40:06.316 --> 40:10.170
The camps were bad places.

40:11.422 --> 40:13.402
Bad things happened there.

40:15.787 --> 40:17.512
Ellen got taken away,

40:18.832 --> 40:21.421
and Tugga joined the
militia when he was 15.

40:23.324 --> 40:24.850
I never seen him again.

40:26.401 --> 40:28.632
When Mama died of the flu,

40:29.651 --> 40:31.224
I just ran away.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.157
Why were... why were they
called "Kennedy camps"?

40:37.987 --> 40:39.611
'Cause he founded 'em

40:40.731 --> 40:42.827
when he wasn't President anymore

40:43.946 --> 40:46.147
after the riots and the...

40:47.400 --> 40:49.010
and the bombs.

40:49.968 --> 40:51.596
Uh, I don't understand.

40:53.268 --> 40:55.934
I thought JFK would've
made things better.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.230
You don't understand this world.

41:01.617 --> 41:02.975
I wanted to make a difference.

41:02.976 --> 41:04.730
That's why I did all this.

41:07.992 --> 41:09.391
My mother, my...

41:12.442 --> 41:13.782
My whole family...

41:21.146 --> 41:22.963
Why'd you save us?

41:25.798 --> 41:27.556
I wanted to help you.

41:29.012 --> 41:30.920
Yo... your father...

41:35.633 --> 41:37.533
I wish...

41:41.188 --> 41:42.763
He wasn't a...

41:45.420 --> 41:46.881
he was my dad.

41:53.111 --> 41:53.924
Yeah.

41:55.490 --> 41:56.361
Yeah.

41:58.706 --> 42:00.212
I never thought that

42:01.277 --> 42:03.359
everything would get so screwed up.

42:05.174 --> 42:06.735
I have to reset it.

42:08.728 --> 42:10.299
Reset what?

42:12.621 --> 42:14.185
Everything.

42:15.125 --> 42:16.391
I have to go.

42:20.443 --> 42:21.725
Bye, Harry.

42:33.054 --> 42:34.314
I don't want any trouble.

42:34.315 --> 42:36.297
- Just passing through, okay?
- "I don't want trouble."

42:36.298 --> 42:39.250
- I don't want any trouble.
- "Don't want any trouble."

42:39.251 --> 42:41.192
"I'm just passing through."

42:41.193 --> 42:42.323
- Get off me!
- "Get off me."

42:42.324 --> 42:45.066
- Get off!
- "Get off me."

42:45.067 --> 42:47.098
"Get off!"

43:05.349 --> 43:07.810
Oh, for the love of Mike.

43:24.584 --> 43:26.290
Sadie!

44:11.834 --> 44:12.969
Hi.

44:13.668 --> 44:15.560
- Hello.
- Um...

44:16.354 --> 44:18.366
We know each other.

44:18.367 --> 44:21.190
- We do?
- Uh, yeah.

44:21.191 --> 44:23.833
You're visiting your cousins here.

44:23.834 --> 44:25.425
Uh...

44:25.426 --> 44:28.168
- That's right.
- Yeah.

44:28.169 --> 44:29.429
You are a librarian,

44:29.430 --> 44:32.768
and you love John Steinbeck,

44:33.995 --> 44:35.436
and you're from East Texas,

44:36.164 --> 44:37.592
went to Vanderbilt.

44:41.253 --> 44:43.224
Is that how we know each other?

44:43.225 --> 44:44.555
No. Um...

44:45.208 --> 44:47.469
I don't want to seem crazy.

44:47.470 --> 44:50.372
You seem a little crazy...

44:50.373 --> 44:52.304
I know. I know. I know.

44:53.177 --> 44:54.438
And you're a little dirty.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.300
- I know.
- Excuse me, sir.

44:57.301 --> 44:59.033
Is he with you?

45:06.280 --> 45:09.183
Um, will you just give me a second?

45:10.035 --> 45:12.968
Please don't... don't go anywhere, okay?

45:13.448 --> 45:15.360
Okay.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.232
What?

45:18.233 --> 45:19.384
What? What?

45:19.385 --> 45:22.925
It's got you, brother.
You're in your own loop.

45:23.654 --> 45:26.240
Look, I-I-I reset everything.

45:26.241 --> 45:27.342
It's gonna be different.

45:27.343 --> 45:29.659
That's what I think every time.

45:30.132 --> 45:31.825
It's always the same loop.

45:31.826 --> 45:33.248
It goes and it goes.

45:33.249 --> 45:35.521
Sadie and I are supposed to be together.

45:35.522 --> 45:39.787
It always ends the same. Still drowning.

45:39.788 --> 45:40.982
- No.
- Still...

45:40.983 --> 45:42.309
Look, I'm not gonna do it the same way.

45:42.310 --> 45:44.491
I know. I won't save JFK.

45:44.492 --> 45:46.473
I-I won't help Harry and his family.

45:46.474 --> 45:48.285
I won't do any of that.

45:48.286 --> 45:49.486
I-I just want Sadie. Please.

45:49.487 --> 45:51.061
- No.
- Please.

45:51.062 --> 45:52.469
- No. No.
- I love her.

45:52.470 --> 45:54.292
Please Please!

45:54.293 --> 45:55.736
It ends the same,

45:56.335 --> 45:57.329
over...

45:57.806 --> 45:59.184
and over...

46:00.279 --> 46:01.439
and over.

46:01.879 --> 46:03.511
It's gonna be different.

46:03.512 --> 46:05.113
She'll always die.

46:05.517 --> 46:06.339
Hey!

46:07.971 --> 46:09.393
Is everything okay?

46:16.143 --> 46:17.458
Yeah, uh...

46:19.670 --> 46:21.189
Just having one of those days.

46:21.662 --> 46:23.275
You never told me how we met.

46:24.265 --> 46:27.337
Right. Um...

46:27.338 --> 46:28.515
Well...

46:54.071 --> 46:55.548
I do know you.

46:56.096 --> 46:57.416
Who are you?

47:01.415 --> 47:03.518
Um...

47:24.621 --> 47:26.373
I'm sorry.

47:27.524 --> 47:28.971
I, uh...

47:31.120 --> 47:32.853
I made a mistake.

47:34.582 --> 47:36.849
Well, it was nice to meet you or...

47:37.767 --> 47:39.471
see you or whichever.

47:48.918 --> 47:50.126
I'm Sadie.

47:58.100 --> 47:59.147
I know.

49:29.596 --> 49:30.677
All right.

49:31.139 --> 49:32.338
Tests here.

49:37.525 --> 49:39.186
Are you okay, Mr. Epping?

49:40.220 --> 49:41.374
Yeah.

49:41.915 --> 49:42.986
I'm Fine.

49:45.614 --> 49:46.714
Bye, sir.

49:46.715 --> 49:47.765
See you in class.

49:47.766 --> 49:49.153
Thank you.

49:50.709 --> 49:52.572
See you later.

50:14.101 --> 50:15.705
Mr. Epping?

50:17.743 --> 50:21.409
I didn't get the promotion,

50:21.410 --> 50:22.436
but...

50:22.960 --> 50:25.025
I wanted to thank you

50:25.905 --> 50:29.427
for putting in the word for me.

50:32.575 --> 50:34.996
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't help you.

50:35.798 --> 50:38.570
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

50:38.571 --> 50:39.772
That's okay, Mr. Epping.

50:39.773 --> 50:41.020
I'm sorry.

50:43.251 --> 50:44.807
You're a good man.

50:45.311 --> 50:46.858
I'm sorry I didn't help you.

50:47.431 --> 50:49.313
You're a good man.

51:49.839 --> 51:52.368
Welcome, citizens of Jodie,

51:52.369 --> 51:54.762
and especially you, JHS alums.

51:56.726 --> 52:00.740
It is my pleasure, as both your mayor

52:00.741 --> 52:03.663
and as a member of the class of '92.

52:03.664 --> 52:04.674
Go Lions!

52:05.866 --> 52:09.799
It's my honor to introduce to
you the woman of the hour...

52:09.800 --> 52:12.863
Or should I say, the Woman of the Year,

52:12.864 --> 52:14.745
which is the honor given to her

52:14.746 --> 52:16.857
by the governor of the state of Texas.

52:17.581 --> 52:20.720
Ladies and gentlemen, our
very own Ms. Sadie Dunhill.

52:57.843 --> 53:00.016
Ms. Sadie, I'd just like to say that

53:00.756 --> 53:02.648
all of us here in this room...

53:03.864 --> 53:05.820
Excuse me... we're all here

53:05.821 --> 53:07.953
because you have touched our lives

53:07.954 --> 53:09.884
in some special way, and,

53:10.539 --> 53:12.007
for all of us, I would just
like to say thank you.

53:12.008 --> 53:13.008
Oh.

53:22.690 --> 53:23.969
Well,

53:23.970 --> 53:25.742
we never know

53:25.743 --> 53:27.033
which lives we influence or...

53:27.034 --> 53:29.998
Or when or why,

53:31.038 --> 53:34.482
but I am so very grateful

53:35.225 --> 53:36.854
to be part of yours.

53:43.012 --> 53:46.815
You older Jodie grads...

53:46.816 --> 53:48.847
Who are here tonight...

53:48.848 --> 53:51.700
You might remember Deke Simmons,

53:52.369 --> 53:54.354
and some of you may recall

53:54.355 --> 53:56.024
that little poem that he...

53:56.025 --> 53:57.405
That he loved...

53:58.332 --> 54:00.019
That he kept on copies on his desk

54:00.020 --> 54:03.853
so that he could hand them out
to troublesome students...

54:03.854 --> 54:06.738
or students that were troubled.

54:07.838 --> 54:11.072
Well, this was the poem.

54:14.826 --> 54:19.972
"We did not ask for this
room or this music.

54:21.073 --> 54:23.633
We were invited in.

54:24.917 --> 54:26.005
Therefore,

54:26.575 --> 54:29.190
because the dark surrounds us,

54:31.009 --> 54:34.948
let us turn our faces to the light.

54:36.860 --> 54:40.863
Let us endure hardship

54:40.864 --> 54:44.027
to be grateful for plenty.

54:45.970 --> 54:51.885
We have been given pain
to be astounded by joy.

54:51.886 --> 54:55.378
We have been given life

54:57.255 --> 54:58.883
to deny death.

55:01.006 --> 55:05.922
We did not ask for this
room or this music.

55:07.694 --> 55:09.528
But because we are here,

55:13.220 --> 55:14.876
let us dance."

55:47.896 --> 55:49.158
Thank you.

56:03.194 --> 56:05.065
May I have this dance?

56:05.066 --> 56:09.110
Oh, I don't think I remember how.

56:16.959 --> 56:18.184
Were you a student here?

56:20.730 --> 56:21.672
I'm a teacher.

56:23.454 --> 56:24.766
And what's your name?

56:25.128 --> 56:26.416
Jake Amberson.

56:26.950 --> 56:28.981
Jake Amberson...

56:29.364 --> 56:31.046
It seems familiar.

56:31.577 --> 56:32.830
Where do you teach?

56:34.444 --> 56:35.855
Lisbon, Maine.

56:36.210 --> 56:38.430
All the way from Maine?

56:39.954 --> 56:41.985
I had cousins in Lisbon.

56:42.576 --> 56:44.579
They were very sweet girls.

56:45.029 --> 56:47.633
So, what brings you to Jodie?

56:47.634 --> 56:48.766
You.

56:48.767 --> 56:52.359
Oh, now you're just being funny.

56:54.239 --> 56:55.610
May I ask you something?

56:56.241 --> 56:57.362
Yes?

56:58.093 --> 57:02.038
Have you... Have you had a happy life?

57:03.025 --> 57:03.922
Well...

57:05.426 --> 57:08.840
I do work that matters.

57:09.266 --> 57:12.208
I love all the people in my life.

57:13.130 --> 57:14.653
I have a dog.

57:16.406 --> 57:21.845
My life has had its
challenges, but... yes.

57:22.853 --> 57:27.125
Yes, I am very happy.

57:28.447 --> 57:29.854
Why do you ask?

57:31.227 --> 57:32.722
You seem like you deserve it.

58:07.118 --> 58:09.344
I'm so happy that you're here.

58:11.243 --> 58:16.068
I could swear I do know you.

58:17.229 --> 58:19.387
Who are you?

58:21.662 --> 58:24.196
Someone you knew in another life.
