00:13.150 --> 00:16.359
This country is nothing
but trees and vines.

00:16.560 --> 00:21.399
How can we ever find the Shrouded
Temple if it's hidden in all this...

00:21.400 --> 00:24.809
Aah!

00:24.810 --> 00:27.809
See? This is what happens
when you wander off, Zemo.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.769
Next time, stay with the tour.

00:29.770 --> 00:34.479
As usual, Captain America,
your humor is elusive.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.689
Hmph. I've got
my eyes on you.

00:36.690 --> 00:38.689
- T'Challa may trust you, but...
- Enough.

00:38.690 --> 00:42.399
The Black Panther does trust me.
This is all that matters.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.309
Trust may be an overstatement.

00:44.310 --> 00:47.439
Let us say our goals coincide.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.689
Our goal is finding
the Shrouded Temple

00:49.690 --> 00:51.809
and unlocking it
with the Panther's Key.

00:51.810 --> 00:54.770
Yet all we have done is wander
aimlessly in this jungle.

00:54.773 --> 00:56.559
For what?

00:56.560 --> 01:00.519
This statue is a marker.
We are close. Shuri?

01:00.520 --> 01:04.479
There's a network of power grids and surge
blocks under this part of the forest.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.690
I'd say very close.

01:07.990 --> 01:10.240
I hate when he does that.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.117
We have found something.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.944
This must be the hidden temple.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.790
Be ready, all of you.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.240
There will be security measures
in place.

01:29.110 --> 01:32.464
These, uh, "security
measures," Black Panther...

01:32.680 --> 01:34.760
what exactly are they?

01:38.970 --> 01:41.100
Whatever
they are, here they come!

02:03.060 --> 02:05.229
Wait. I've seen these.

02:05.230 --> 02:07.041
Princess, look out!

02:10.300 --> 02:12.299
T'Challa, these things
seem to be based

02:12.300 --> 02:14.249
on third generation
robotics designs.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.717
Understood.

02:23.690 --> 02:26.185
The power cell... disable it.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.039
Got it. Thanks.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.299
Just breaking them
works fine too.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.316
It's a design flaw.

02:41.170 --> 02:43.130
We don't make
them like this anymore.

02:54.660 --> 02:55.910
Zemo!

03:02.203 --> 03:04.249
Is everybody all right?

03:07.890 --> 03:12.022
Uh, no. No,
I don't think we are.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.494
Princess, look out!

03:38.010 --> 03:39.889
This one has no power cell!

03:40.384 --> 03:42.929
There has to be another way
to shut it down.

03:43.704 --> 03:45.889
Sure. But I don't see where...

03:48.180 --> 03:49.680
Get down, Captain!

03:51.180 --> 03:54.049
Thank you.

03:54.050 --> 03:57.139
You are welcome.
But we're still at its mercy.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.140
T'Challa!

04:01.893 --> 04:04.220
Of course!
The Panther's Key!

04:05.260 --> 04:06.840
Aah!

04:10.218 --> 04:11.219
Shuri! The key!

04:14.340 --> 04:15.695
T'Challa!

04:19.140 --> 04:21.839
I am well, sister.
No need to shout.

04:36.970 --> 04:40.800
I think that means
we're invited.

04:48.260 --> 04:49.389
Impressive.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.706
In a dusty,
old-school kind of way.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.668
Your people built all this
only to bury it in the jungle.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.367
Huh. Such a waste.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.165
What do you make of those dots?
Some kind of warning?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.640
I do not think so, Captain.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.099
Stars. They are stars.

05:22.100 --> 05:25.019
T'Challa, I don't think
this is a temple.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.729
It feels more like...
an observatory?

05:27.730 --> 05:30.785
Your are right.
This is not the Shrouded Temple.

05:33.690 --> 05:36.999
But perhaps somewhat more
than an observatory.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.729
What do you think? Any idea of
what this old stuff might do?

05:44.730 --> 05:46.729
It is hard to say.

05:46.730 --> 05:49.899
While our forebears were advanced for
their time, everything here is...

05:49.900 --> 05:52.721
Old. Everything here is old.

05:52.850 --> 05:56.269
Yet according to my scans,
this is an elevator.

05:56.270 --> 05:59.857
That's strange.
I'm not reading any sublevels.

05:59.980 --> 06:02.139
None of you find this
all a bit convenient?

06:02.140 --> 06:05.979
This is precisely the sort of lure
I would use to trap an enemy.

06:07.306 --> 06:09.104
You may stay here
if you wish, Zemo.

06:09.230 --> 06:11.939
Alone. In the jungle.

06:11.940 --> 06:15.139
Very well.
If you insist.

06:18.140 --> 06:21.140
And now?
Is something meant to happen?

06:28.100 --> 06:30.849
I was right.
It is an elevator.

06:30.850 --> 06:33.729
To doom us
in the depths of space!

06:33.730 --> 06:34.725
We...

06:36.730 --> 06:39.729
Just how long
has Wakanda had space travel?

06:39.730 --> 06:41.270
Quite a long time, Captain.

06:41.271 --> 06:42.809
Your grandfather and I
weren't close,

06:42.810 --> 06:45.139
but you'd think he would've
mentioned something about this.

06:45.140 --> 06:48.770
The kings and queens of Wakanda
are bound to keep its secrets.

06:53.770 --> 06:56.939
Looks like your
grandfather kept his fair share.

06:56.940 --> 07:00.059
Indeed, Captain. Indeed.

07:00.060 --> 07:02.809
And that can only be
the Shrouded Temple.

07:02.810 --> 07:04.849
We found it.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.962
We actually found it.

07:07.190 --> 07:09.008
We did.

07:09.770 --> 07:12.845
So why don't I have
a good feeling about this?

07:21.060 --> 07:22.450
<i>Intruders.</i>

07:22.453 --> 07:24.580
<i>Engage primary defense.</i>

07:29.230 --> 07:34.354
I am T'Challa, King of Wakanda.
Accept Royal Authority.

07:34.810 --> 07:35.810
Will that work?

07:35.811 --> 07:36.809
It better.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.189
We're sitting ducks out here.

07:38.190 --> 07:41.230
<i>Royal Authority accepted.</i>

07:53.100 --> 07:56.309
Is that... Grandfather?

07:56.310 --> 07:59.060
<i>Welcome, King of Wakanda.</i>

08:00.935 --> 08:02.099
T'Chanda?!

08:02.100 --> 08:04.099
He looks the same
as he did in the '40s.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.309
It's the interface
for temple security.

08:06.510 --> 08:10.339
T'Challa, the system only responds
to the ruler of Wakanda... you.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.364
<i>Why are you here?</i>

08:12.810 --> 08:14.229
We seek knowledge.

08:14.230 --> 08:16.229
Why was this temple constructed?

08:16.230 --> 08:18.019
What is its purpose?

08:18.020 --> 08:19.537
<i>Come.</i>

08:20.604 --> 08:23.899
<i>There are many
dangerous objects on Earth.</i>

08:23.900 --> 08:26.461
<i>Artifacts of terrible power.</i>

08:28.850 --> 08:31.939
<i>Our ancestors realized they
must be kept hidden from those</i>

08:31.940 --> 08:34.748
<i>who would use
those powers for evil.</i>

08:36.309 --> 08:40.269
<i>Beyond this door is the most
dangerous artifact of all.</i>

08:40.270 --> 08:43.269
<i>It is the reason
the temple was built.</i>

08:43.270 --> 08:46.396
<i>We call it, simply, the Crown.</i>

08:47.310 --> 08:50.939
"The Crown"? T'Challa,
what is he talking about?

08:50.940 --> 08:54.020
I believe we are about to find out.

09:16.940 --> 09:19.099
This is disappointing,
I must say.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.849
Your people built all this
to contain a single crown?

09:22.850 --> 09:25.019
Hang on. Wait.

09:25.020 --> 09:27.059
I've seen this box before.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.059
When I was with
your grandfather.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.568
What's inside it?

09:31.060 --> 09:33.059
I don't know. We thought...

09:33.060 --> 09:35.229
I thought it was destroyed.

09:35.230 --> 09:38.229
T'Chanda had his reasons for
placing the Crown on this vessel.

09:38.230 --> 09:42.020
I think we should obey those
reasons and leave it where it is.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.269
I'm with the Princess.

09:46.270 --> 09:48.229
The temple is secret.
It's secure.

09:48.230 --> 09:51.099
It was nearly impossible
to get here, even for us.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.645
No one else will find it.

09:52.646 --> 09:54.189
We cannot know that.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.189
Killmonger had access
to many secrets.

09:56.190 --> 09:59.060
We must assume the Shadow
Council shares...

10:00.639 --> 10:03.019
That's plasma fire!
We're under attack!

10:03.020 --> 10:04.625
What about the Crown?

10:04.626 --> 10:06.229
Leave it.
It's safest here.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.750
Right, T'Challa?

10:07.751 --> 10:09.269
For now.

10:09.773 --> 10:11.301
What?

10:11.302 --> 10:12.838
- We need to get back to the...
- No! Stop!

10:22.223 --> 10:23.996
Aahh!

10:28.670 --> 10:32.590
<i>T'Challa! T'Challa, talk to me!
Are you all right?</i>

10:34.630 --> 10:36.589
I am unharmed.

10:36.590 --> 10:39.590
I have enough oxygen for several minutes.
What about you?

10:45.180 --> 10:47.429
The automatic safety systems
have engaged.

10:47.430 --> 10:48.437
We should be fine.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.499
What was that?
What happened?

10:51.500 --> 10:53.525
I happened, T'Challa.

10:55.750 --> 10:59.469
Killmonger!
This attack is your doing!

10:59.470 --> 11:02.339
As always, I am a step ahead.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.953
Thank you for leading us
to the Shrouded Temple.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.371
And here's our Dr. Frost.

11:07.510 --> 11:10.509
All done wrapping up the big
surprise, eh, Whitney girl?

11:15.550 --> 11:18.299
Don't call me that.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.389
My name is Madame Masque.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.509
Not Frost. Not Whitney.

11:23.510 --> 11:26.851
Not "girl."
Understand?

11:28.340 --> 11:30.429
I'm sure he does.

11:30.430 --> 11:32.549
Release him.

11:37.026 --> 11:38.864
Focus, both of you.

11:48.470 --> 11:51.536
You are not permitted
to enter the temple, traitor.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.669
I don't need your permission.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.299
But don't worry.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.873
I've left you a surprise
to enjoy.

12:07.896 --> 12:09.459
The Shadow Council's attacking.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.605
How did they find us?

12:10.606 --> 12:11.749
We have another problem.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.749
Those blasts knocked us
out of orbit.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.499
Earth's gravity has us.
We are crashing!

12:16.500 --> 12:19.140
The temple must have
a manual control station.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.460
- We need...
- To be given

12:20.463 --> 12:21.998
a hearty "thank you."

12:23.500 --> 12:24.709
Killmonger!

12:24.710 --> 12:28.630
Indeed. Madame Masque,
if you please.

12:30.590 --> 12:33.709
Traitor! What have you
done with T'Challa?

12:33.710 --> 12:37.799
Nothing, Princess. Only
left him a small surprise.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.539
Now, stand aside
if you want to live.

12:41.540 --> 12:42.605
Aah!

12:42.606 --> 12:45.420
Move, people! We can't let
them take the temple!

13:04.670 --> 13:06.629
Going somewhere, Cat King?

13:06.630 --> 13:08.085
Tiger Shark!

13:08.086 --> 13:09.539
Surprise!

13:12.281 --> 13:13.499
Is this your best effort?

13:13.500 --> 13:16.629
Perhaps your fighting prowess
is overrated.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.716
Anybody ever tell you
you talk too much?

13:28.710 --> 13:32.629
You're Whitney Frost.
My brother told me about you.

13:32.630 --> 13:35.589
My name is Madame Masque.

13:35.590 --> 13:38.839
You're some kind of... mechanic
or something, right?

13:38.840 --> 13:41.630
Mechanic? Mechanic?!

13:44.800 --> 13:46.879
Got you on the run now, Zemo!

13:46.880 --> 13:49.762
Looks like you backed
the wrong horse.

13:52.630 --> 13:56.205
You will never have the
Crown, you ridiculous fool!

13:59.500 --> 14:01.919
Aah!

14:03.710 --> 14:06.709
I beg to differ, Mr. Zemo.

14:06.710 --> 14:09.839
Yes, Black Panther, fight!

14:09.840 --> 14:13.919
The more you struggle,
the more air you use.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.919
You are right.
But we are close enough now.

14:21.670 --> 14:23.879
What is this?
What are you doing?

14:23.880 --> 14:25.880
I am hacking your propulsion system.

14:30.670 --> 14:34.839
Stop! No! We'll crash!
Let me go!

14:35.371 --> 14:36.696
As you wish.

14:39.590 --> 14:42.880
Noooooo!

14:57.710 --> 15:00.525
Finish him.
I will take the Crown.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.839
Listen to me!

15:07.840 --> 15:09.749
The temple is falling to Earth.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.749
It's going to burn up
in reentry.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.710
Look.
See for yourself.

15:18.590 --> 15:19.875
Uncontrolled reentry.

15:19.900 --> 15:24.003
Calculating speed,
vectors, impact force...

15:27.710 --> 15:30.799
Well done, sister.
Very well done.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.539
T'Challa!

15:32.540 --> 15:33.625
You're alive!

15:33.626 --> 15:34.709
Apparently.

15:34.710 --> 15:36.879
But our situation remains dire.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.919
Where are Captain
America and Zemo?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.919
Where are the rest
of the Shadow Council?

15:40.920 --> 15:43.499
How about two out of four?

15:45.171 --> 15:46.984
Glad to see you in one piece.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.999
Tiger Shark has been dealt with.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.999
Madame Masque
and Klaue are down.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.500
That leaves only Killmonger.

15:53.501 --> 15:55.000
And Zemo.

15:58.630 --> 16:00.919
Ha. At last!

16:00.920 --> 16:02.458
Victory is...

16:03.000 --> 16:05.709
Never!

16:05.710 --> 16:08.999
The Crown's power
isn't meant for petty tyrants.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.539
T'Challa's weakness
has infected you.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.669
Zemo's change of heart
is not weakness.

16:21.670 --> 16:24.230
You will never have the Crown.

16:24.430 --> 16:25.730
Aah!

16:26.590 --> 16:29.039
- Do you want good news or bad?
- Tell me all of it.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.611
I've analyzed our trajectory.

16:30.636 --> 16:33.089
The good news is we won't
burn up on reentry after all.

16:33.090 --> 16:36.960
The bad news is that we're going
to crash into New York City!

16:40.670 --> 16:42.487
If we can't change
the temple's trajectory,

16:42.512 --> 16:44.499
we're going to crash
into New York.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.999
What kind of damage are we
talking about here? Worst case.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.784
At this speed, the impact of
something as large as the temple

16:49.809 --> 16:51.089
would be an extinction event.

16:51.090 --> 16:55.089
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did he just say
"extinction," as in "everybody wiped out"?

16:55.090 --> 16:58.499
That is what "extinction" means.
Unless...

16:58.500 --> 17:00.709
"Unless"? "Unless" is good.

17:00.710 --> 17:04.039
We could self-destruct.
From here, I mean.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.540
We could.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.039
W-Wait. Who is "we"?

17:07.040 --> 17:10.539
Shuri's right. We could blow up the
temple. It'll save all those lives.

17:10.540 --> 17:13.959
No. It won't.
It won't work.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.460
I'm with her.

17:15.461 --> 17:16.959
Stay back, Madame Masque.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.669
Blowing up the temple
won't save anyone.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.799
The pieces will still hit.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.799
- I may be able to help if...
- She said, "Stay back."

17:25.800 --> 17:28.839
Do you want to fix the damage
to this ship or not?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.171
Let... me... help.

17:44.044 --> 17:45.959
So weak, T'Challa.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.749
So desperate.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.879
Giving your enemies control
of your fate.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.169
You are no king. You're just
a spoiled little...

17:52.170 --> 17:54.629
Quiet, please.
I'm concentrating.

17:55.149 --> 17:57.129
Yes, there is a lot of damage.

17:57.130 --> 17:59.089
With help, I can fix most of it.

17:59.090 --> 18:01.299
But someone will still
have to pilot us down.

18:01.300 --> 18:02.960
Where is the pilot's station?

18:05.040 --> 18:07.130
Three levels up, rear seven.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.129
T'Challa, I'm the better pilot.

18:11.130 --> 18:14.129
Shuri, all this, all of you...

18:14.130 --> 18:16.169
you are my responsibility.

18:16.170 --> 18:19.920
You stay here. Use your tech
skills to help Madame Masque.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.879
We're still missing connections
in grids 20 and six.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.442
Those sections were destroyed.

18:34.090 --> 18:36.169
By you!
When you attacked us!

18:36.170 --> 18:38.039
Rerouting those systems.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.839
There's another problem...
the debris field.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.999
Also created by your attack.
I'm seeing a pattern here.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.749
You're seeing the wrong pattern.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.709
The attack is the past.
Look at the debris field.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.509
It's spread too wide.

18:50.510 --> 18:53.027
Even if we land the temple,
we'll never catch all of it.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.039
This isn't going to work.

18:55.040 --> 18:58.089
They're failing.
We are all going to die!

18:58.090 --> 19:01.089
No one's dying, Klaue.
Right, ladies?

19:01.090 --> 19:02.285
Inconclusive.

19:02.286 --> 19:03.679
No. I'm sorry.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.209
The correct answer is: "Right, Captain.
No one is dying."

19:07.210 --> 19:09.479
T'Challa, where are you?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.840
Entering
the pilot's station now.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.299
The security system
appears to be damaged.

19:19.300 --> 19:23.089
It is not allowing access. But I
may be able to bypass the systems.

19:23.090 --> 19:24.960
There!
I have taken care of it.

19:26.170 --> 19:28.089
Pilot system engaged.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.712
You could also extend the temple's
gravity net around the debris field.

19:43.130 --> 19:44.999
The net would be too thin.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.919
We'll need something
to give it a power boost.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.299
A medium, like water, or...
or plasma, or...

19:50.300 --> 19:52.839
Sound waves!

19:52.840 --> 19:56.250
They're looking at me.
Why are they looking at me?

19:58.130 --> 20:01.249
Aaahhh!

20:01.250 --> 20:03.959
I think it's your turn
to be a hero, Klaue.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.959
Oh, no. No, no, no!

20:06.960 --> 20:09.169
I'm strictly a passenger
on this flight!

20:09.170 --> 20:12.364
Shut up, you big baby.
It won't hurt.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.065
It won't, right?

20:14.066 --> 20:15.249
If he keeps his mouth shut.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.300
Okay.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.170
Aah!

21:07.554 --> 21:10.799
We must secure the
Crown before someone stumbles on it.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.039
Are we sure
it made it through the crash?

21:13.040 --> 21:15.419
No mere crash
could destroy the Crown.

21:15.420 --> 21:17.441
It is here, somewhere.

21:17.941 --> 21:20.959
Okay, we've got a deadly
ancient object to find.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.778
Let's move, people.
