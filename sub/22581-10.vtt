00:24.900 --> 00:26.568
Hauled down in the corner
of the end zone.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.904
Touchdown!

00:29.529 --> 00:33.450
Like to see you make that catch with
the gravity plating at Earth sea level.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.203
I doubt you could throw
the ball ten meters on Earth.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.413
One more reason not to go.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.833
Did you find out what was causing
that vibration in Module Two?

00:42.083 --> 00:45.962
The cargo handlers at Jupiter Station,
they didn't balance the load.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.174
Shaw and I, we trimmed it out.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.676
Keep an eye on it.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.095
Bridge to Captain Keene.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.806
We're under attack, sir.
It's the Nausicaans.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.185
Drop out of warp.
Charge the plasma cannons...

01:11.321 --> 01:16.659
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:19.120 --> 01:22.540
"It's been a long time"

01:22.749 --> 01:26.586
"But my time is finally near"

01:26.794 --> 01:31.049
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:31.257 --> 01:34.177
"I will touch the sky"

01:34.385 --> 01:38.181
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:38.389 --> 01:41.392
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:41.601 --> 01:46.314
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:46.522 --> 01:49.442
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:49.650 --> 01:54.238
"I've got faith to believe"

01:54.447 --> 01:57.033
"I can do anything"

01:57.241 --> 02:01.746
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:01.954 --> 02:04.832
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:05.041 --> 02:10.378
"I can reach any star"

02:10.755 --> 02:14.508
"I've got faith"

02:14.717 --> 02:18.429
"I've got faith"

02:18.637 --> 02:23.434
"Faith of the heart"

02:50.268 --> 02:52.645
- Archer.
- Sorry to disturb you, sir,

02:52.854 --> 02:55.524
but I have an incoming transmission
from Starfleet Command.

02:55.733 --> 02:58.027
It's Admiral Forrest.

03:08.999 --> 03:11.711
- Put him through.
- Yes, sir.

03:13.171 --> 03:15.590
Admiral, good to see you.

03:15.798 --> 03:19.345
You too, Jon.
What I can make out.

03:19.845 --> 03:23.099
We're getting ready to deploy
the first subspace amplifier.

03:23.308 --> 03:25.060
Should clear up reception a bit.

03:25.310 --> 03:27.480
Whatever you have to do
to keep those reports coming.

03:27.688 --> 03:29.775
The scans of that comet
were incredible.

03:30.025 --> 03:33.487
Something tells me you didn't call
at 4 in the morning to talk comets.

03:33.738 --> 03:37.200
I hate to do this to you, Jon,
but we're turning you around.

03:37.825 --> 03:40.746
- Sir?
- We picked up a distress signal

03:40.954 --> 03:44.333
from a cargo freighter,
the ECS Fortunate.

03:44.541 --> 03:48.213
The nearest Starfleet vessel is three
weeks away at its maximum warp,

03:48.421 --> 03:51.176
but you could be there
in a day and a half.

03:51.384 --> 03:53.762
- What's the problem?
- We're not sure.

03:54.012 --> 03:56.306
They're not responding to hails.

03:56.514 --> 03:58.643
I'd like you to check this out.

03:58.851 --> 04:00.519
Give them any assistance
they need.

04:01.020 --> 04:04.107
- We're on our way.
- Forrest out.

04:09.238 --> 04:11.908
I think our day's
gonna start a little early.

04:13.451 --> 04:15.830
The Earth cargo ship, Fortunate.

04:16.039 --> 04:17.499
Y-class freighter.

04:17.707 --> 04:19.959
Maximum speed, warp 1.8.

04:20.168 --> 04:22.421
Crew complement: 23.

04:22.671 --> 04:25.550
Not counting newborn babies.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.094
- Ensign?
- I grew up on a J-class.

04:28.303 --> 04:30.680
A little smaller,
but the same basic design.

04:30.889 --> 04:33.601
And one thing I can tell you
is that at warp 1.8,

04:33.809 --> 04:36.520
you've got a lot of time
on your hands between ports.

04:36.937 --> 04:38.857
That's how my parents
wound up with me.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.905
Do you have any helpful information
on this vessel beyond its

04:43.113 --> 04:44.907
recreational activities?

04:45.157 --> 04:47.451
For example, what kind
of weapons they carry.

04:48.077 --> 04:51.581
Well, typically nothing more
than a low-yield plasma cannon,

04:51.790 --> 04:54.627
but most freight haulers would've
upgraded the first chance they got.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.629
- Why is that?
- Think about it.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.255
You're a dozen
light-years from home

04:58.464 --> 05:00.884
with 20 kilotons
of dilithium ore in your hold,

05:01.092 --> 05:04.138
armed with nothing but a popgun
for shooting oncoming meteors.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.725
What would you do?

05:14.359 --> 05:15.652
I'm reading hull damage.

05:15.902 --> 05:19.656
Their warp reactor's off-line, and most
of their primary systems are down.

05:20.449 --> 05:22.117
Any other ships in the region?

05:22.326 --> 05:24.204
None, captain.

05:24.788 --> 05:26.623
Open a channel.

05:28.250 --> 05:33.965
Fortunate, this is Captain Jonathan
Archer of the starship Enterprise.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.099
Fortunate, please respond.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.852
Their com systems may be down.

05:44.061 --> 05:46.981
I'm reading 24 bio-signs.

05:47.190 --> 05:50.485
Have Dr Phlox meet us
in the Launch Bay.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.794
Easy does it.

06:04.002 --> 06:06.421
There's a lot of debris out here.

06:07.088 --> 06:08.924
Aye, sir.

06:09.926 --> 06:12.470
Some of it doesn't appear
to be from the Fortunate.

06:12.678 --> 06:15.474
On the bright side, I'm only
picking up inorganic material.

06:15.682 --> 06:17.685
No bodies.

06:19.270 --> 06:21.065
The main hatch is damaged.

06:21.273 --> 06:24.151
No chance we'll get a positive seal.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.405
There should be an auxiliary hatch
on the port side.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.267
- Permission to come aboard.
- Granted.

06:51.643 --> 06:53.603
I'm Matthew Ryan, first officer.

06:53.811 --> 06:56.190
Jonathan Archer,
captain of the Enterprise.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.985
Sorry we couldn't meet
under better circumstances.

07:00.402 --> 07:02.572
- What happened here?
- Nausicaans.

07:02.781 --> 07:04.075
They tried to board us.

07:04.283 --> 07:07.371
We managed to fight them off,
but not before we took a few bruises.

07:07.621 --> 07:10.123
- Nausicaans?
- Pirates, sir.

07:10.332 --> 07:13.419
They've been attacking freighters
in this sector for years.

07:13.628 --> 07:15.171
My parents had a run-in
with them once.

07:15.379 --> 07:17.256
They were lucky
to come out of it alive.

07:17.507 --> 07:20.052
- Your parents ran freight?
- Still do.

07:20.260 --> 07:23.096
An old J-Class. The Horizon.

07:23.722 --> 07:26.184
I've got repair teams standing by.
What can we do?

07:26.434 --> 07:29.063
Oh, we can handle this
ourselves, captain.

07:29.313 --> 07:30.690
But thank you.

07:35.779 --> 07:39.158
One of our younger
crewmembers panicked,

07:39.367 --> 07:40.951
hit the emergency beacon.

07:41.160 --> 07:45.082
With our com down, we had no way
to tell Starfleet to ignore it.

07:45.582 --> 07:46.833
Where's your captain?

07:47.543 --> 07:49.087
He was wounded in the attack.

07:49.295 --> 07:52.173
I'm in command
until he's back on his feet.

07:52.424 --> 07:55.178
I'm sorry we took valuable time
away from your mission.

07:55.386 --> 08:00.017
Mr Ryan, I'm a physician.
If your captain or anyone else is hurt,

08:00.226 --> 08:03.187
it wouldn't be right for me
to leave without seeing them.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.983
He's got a lot more experience
than any freighter medic I know.

08:08.068 --> 08:10.403
We've come an awfully long way.

08:10.655 --> 08:14.075
It would be a shame to turn around
without lending a hand.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.960
Is he going to die?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.921
Not anytime soon.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.507
The Nausicaan weapon disrupted
his neural pathways.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.676
I've started him
on a cortical regeneration,

08:28.885 --> 08:30.595
but it'll take some time.

08:30.804 --> 08:34.600
- How long?
- Two days, maybe three.

08:40.106 --> 08:42.943
Since we have to stick around,

08:43.152 --> 08:45.364
we might as well help you get
your ship up and running.

08:45.572 --> 08:47.157
That's all right.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.704
I understand you're used to
doing things on your own,

08:51.913 --> 08:54.791
but we're here. Use us.

08:54.999 --> 08:58.379
We might be able to upgrade
your hull plating, your weapons.

08:58.629 --> 09:01.673
Couldn't hurt the next time
you run into these Nausicaans.

09:01.882 --> 09:04.803
The sooner you're back at warp,
the sooner that cargo you're hauling

09:05.012 --> 09:07.181
gets to where it's supposed to go.

09:13.855 --> 09:15.525
You're letting them
send over more people?

09:15.733 --> 09:17.360
A few engineers, that's all.

09:17.568 --> 09:19.570
We can't have people crawling
all over the place.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.949
We'll keep them where
they're supposed to be.

09:22.157 --> 09:24.326
- What if they find him?
- What do you want me to do?

09:24.534 --> 09:26.371
Throw them off the ship?

09:28.873 --> 09:30.668
Anything?

09:31.795 --> 09:33.546
Keep at it.

09:38.386 --> 09:40.638
I want those codes.

09:56.991 --> 10:00.454
Trip will get a kick out of this.
It's older than he is.

10:00.663 --> 10:02.456
The quartermaster
won't have anything like it

10:02.665 --> 10:04.375
but Engineering should
be able to make one.

10:04.583 --> 10:05.960
We've got our own machine shop.

10:06.169 --> 10:09.255
I'm sure your guys have their
hands full. We're happy to do it.

10:09.464 --> 10:11.759
That's a transporter.

10:13.135 --> 10:15.346
Enterprise came with
all the trimmings.

10:15.554 --> 10:17.892
I've read about them.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.727
Have you been through it?

10:19.936 --> 10:21.354
Not yet.

10:21.562 --> 10:25.734
Most of the crew's afraid,
but I'm kind of curious to try it out.

10:27.528 --> 10:30.615
They say that for a split second,

10:30.865 --> 10:34.285
you can actually feel yourself
in both places at once.

10:34.535 --> 10:36.830
Why do you think I wanna try it?

10:39.500 --> 10:42.421
- So you were on the Horizon?
- I was born on her.

10:42.630 --> 10:44.840
Halfway between Draylax
and Vega Colony.

10:45.049 --> 10:47.094
How do your parents feel
about you leaving?

10:47.302 --> 10:49.971
I've still got my sister
and her husband aboard the Horizon.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.767
But I know my dad expected me
to take over at some point.

10:52.975 --> 10:54.352
Then why did you leave?

10:54.560 --> 10:57.146
I had to figure out where I wanted
to spend the rest of my life.

10:57.355 --> 11:00.734
And I was pretty sure it wasn't
on the Draylax-Vega run.

11:00.943 --> 11:05.698
Besides, the Horizon didn't
have transporters to play with.

11:07.993 --> 11:09.412
These valve seals are shot.

11:09.621 --> 11:11.623
We'll have to synthesize
some new ones.

11:11.831 --> 11:14.125
Give me about 40 minutes.

11:14.793 --> 11:18.297
If you want, our resident
boomer here can give you a tour.

11:18.506 --> 11:19.924
Thanks.

11:20.132 --> 11:22.052
I've already seen most of the ship.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.262
You missed the best part.

11:24.471 --> 11:27.392
The only warp-5 engine
in the fleet.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.310
I've heard about it.

11:29.519 --> 11:32.147
Once they get installed
in the next generation of freighters,

11:32.357 --> 11:34.234
it'll change a whole lot of things.

11:34.442 --> 11:37.612
Even with a warp-3 engine, you'd be
able to cut a five-year cargo run

11:37.821 --> 11:39.657
down to six months.

11:40.407 --> 11:43.035
Warp 1.8 works just fine for us.

11:43.244 --> 11:47.832
Any faster and there would be
no time to enjoy the trip.

11:51.170 --> 11:54.216
Save room for dessert.
Homemade ice cream.

11:54.424 --> 11:55.927
You eat this well all the time?

11:56.135 --> 11:57.970
Chef's the best in Starfleet.

11:58.179 --> 12:02.142
I heard the captain had to call in
a lot of favours to get him onboard.

12:08.858 --> 12:11.236
It's good you stayed away
from the resequenced meat loaf.

12:11.444 --> 12:13.030
They still haven't gotten that right.

12:13.239 --> 12:15.991
Resequenced? This tastes real.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.286
That's because it is.

12:18.496 --> 12:20.706
You know the last time
I had a steak?

12:20.915 --> 12:22.333
Eighteen months ago.

12:22.541 --> 12:26.338
All we've got left now
are hydroponics and nutri-paks.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.466
- I remember those.
- What did we used to call them?

12:29.675 --> 12:32.303
- Mystery meals.
- Mystery meals!

12:32.845 --> 12:35.056
My dad was a pretty good cook.

12:35.264 --> 12:38.185
He could do magical things
with those nutri-paks.

12:38.394 --> 12:41.397
When it was someone's birthday,
my mother would bake a cake.

12:41.606 --> 12:43.734
We knew better than to ask
what it was made of.

12:43.943 --> 12:47.238
- Didn't stop you from eating it.
- Oh, no way.

12:47.739 --> 12:50.367
Your parents on the Fortunate?

12:51.660 --> 12:53.371
No.

12:54.288 --> 12:56.332
They were on the North Star.

13:03.131 --> 13:05.134
Were you onboard?

13:05.760 --> 13:08.013
Yeah, I was one of the survivors.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.349
I went to the Fortunate after that.

13:13.812 --> 13:15.563
I'm sorry.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.734
Running freight is dangerous.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.784
You ever think about
doing something else?

13:27.035 --> 13:29.288
You mean join Starfleet?

13:30.081 --> 13:31.708
The food's not bad.

13:33.670 --> 13:35.797
Was this premeditated?

13:36.005 --> 13:38.216
Buy me lunch and give me
the recruiting pitch?

13:38.424 --> 13:43.055
No, but you've spent more time
in space than most Starfleet captains.

13:43.263 --> 13:45.934
There are three more NX-class ships
on the drawing boards.

13:46.142 --> 13:49.229
They're going to need
experienced people.

13:50.981 --> 13:53.359
If Starfleet gets all the good crews,

13:53.567 --> 13:55.237
who does that leave to run
the freighters?

13:55.612 --> 13:57.824
Don't worry.
Not everybody's going to go.

13:58.074 --> 14:00.368
You did.

14:02.996 --> 14:06.625
You think leaving the Horizon
was easy for me?

14:06.875 --> 14:10.296
That I just took off because
I got tired of the food?

14:12.548 --> 14:14.885
That ship was my home.

14:16.136 --> 14:18.180
So why did you leave it?

14:18.889 --> 14:21.686
Why did you abandon your family?

14:24.730 --> 14:28.318
Being in Starfleet is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

14:28.527 --> 14:31.739
My parents weren't happy I left,
but they respected my decision.

14:32.323 --> 14:34.075
Did they?

14:34.575 --> 14:37.371
Or were they just saying
what you wanted to hear,

14:37.621 --> 14:39.581
so you wouldn't feel guilty?

14:45.881 --> 14:49.469
Commander Tucker should be done
with my valve assembly by now.

14:50.428 --> 14:52.389
Thanks for lunch.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.911
Come on.

15:18.837 --> 15:21.215
Why is power being rerouted
from internal sensors

15:21.423 --> 15:22.716
to the weapons systems?

15:22.967 --> 15:26.471
Maybe you didn't notice.
We were in a battle.

15:27.973 --> 15:30.935
The battle is over.
I'll remove the bypass.

15:31.143 --> 15:32.479
That's all right.

15:32.688 --> 15:34.564
You can just leave them.

15:46.663 --> 15:48.957
Ready or not, here I come.

15:49.207 --> 15:51.877
- Have you seen Nadine?
- No.

15:54.129 --> 15:55.506
Have you seen Nadine?

15:56.174 --> 16:00.221
I'm sorry, I don't know
which child is named Nadine.

16:05.686 --> 16:09.106
- Thanks.
- I just told him the truth.

16:22.456 --> 16:24.625
T'Pol to Archer.

16:25.876 --> 16:29.422
- Go ahead.
- The repairs are almost finished.

16:29.631 --> 16:30.841
Acknowledged.

16:31.049 --> 16:35.388
But there is something I need
to speak to you about in private.

16:40.644 --> 16:43.815
Those engine parts Mr Tucker
gave you working out okay?

16:44.065 --> 16:47.820
Some of the connections were off by
a few microns, but they should be fine.

16:48.278 --> 16:49.739
Good.

16:50.281 --> 16:53.827
Dr Phlox tells me Captain Keene's
condition is improving.

16:54.077 --> 16:56.747
Well, he's still unconscious,
but the burns are healing.

16:56.956 --> 16:59.250
Thanks to your doctor.

17:00.084 --> 17:02.295
Anything else we can do?

17:03.672 --> 17:07.050
Thanks, but we're anxious
to get under way.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.554
Goodbye, captain.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.932
There's one other question
I'd like to ask you.

17:12.976 --> 17:16.479
Are there only humans
onboard your ship?

17:18.440 --> 17:23.278
I think one of the kids has
a Teneebian skunk as a pet,

17:23.487 --> 17:26.324
- if that's what you mean.
- It isn't.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.619
T'Pol's scanner picked up
a Nausicaan bio-sign.

17:30.871 --> 17:32.624
Are you saying
we've got a stowaway?

17:34.042 --> 17:36.420
You know that's not
what we're saying.

17:37.755 --> 17:39.882
Why don't you tell us
what's going on over there.

17:40.591 --> 17:42.636
Well, what are you talking about?

17:42.886 --> 17:47.182
My bio-scans indicated
this Nausicaan was injured.

17:50.186 --> 17:51.980
Okay.

17:52.730 --> 17:56.360
Not that it's any of your business,
but there is a Nausicaan aboard.

17:56.568 --> 17:58.738
He's my prisoner.

18:00.449 --> 18:04.370
What gives you the right
to take prisoners?

18:05.580 --> 18:08.583
They have been attacking
our ship for months.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.796
Stealing our cargo.
They nearly killed my captain.

18:12.004 --> 18:15.258
Now what gives them
the right to do that?

18:19.137 --> 18:23.018
- I wanna see him.
- And what would you do?

18:23.227 --> 18:25.020
Take him back to Nausicaa?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.064
They'd probably give him a medal.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.567
What do you plan to do with him?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.821
That is my business.

18:33.029 --> 18:37.660
Starfleet doesn't have any jurisdiction
over what goes on aboard my ship.

18:38.411 --> 18:40.038
You're right.

18:41.832 --> 18:45.879
But there is one thing
I do have jurisdiction over.

18:46.797 --> 18:48.715
- Archer to Tucker.
- Go ahead, captain.

18:48.924 --> 18:51.261
I want you to remove all
the spare parts and equipment

18:51.469 --> 18:53.137
you installed on the Fortunate.

18:53.346 --> 18:56.140
- Sir?
- You heard me, Trip.

18:56.349 --> 18:57.851
You wouldn't do that.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.020
Watch me.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.653
He's in there.

19:19.502 --> 19:21.130
Where?

19:22.464 --> 19:24.716
He's tied up over there.

19:42.029 --> 19:44.283
I'm reading one bio-sign,

19:44.491 --> 19:46.868
but it's not Nausicaan.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.882
Don't do this.

20:01.178 --> 20:02.471
Get down.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.182
Under the circumstances,
I defer to your experience.

20:09.354 --> 20:11.022
Ryan!

20:12.149 --> 20:14.485
You're making a big mistake.

20:18.865 --> 20:20.325
Go.

20:55.910 --> 20:57.997
Captain, there's a breach.

21:09.844 --> 21:11.555
Ryan!

21:18.187 --> 21:19.939
What was that?

21:36.001 --> 21:37.460
What the hell
is going on over there?

21:37.669 --> 21:39.505
There are four bio-signs
on the module.

21:39.714 --> 21:41.090
It's the Away Team.

21:41.298 --> 21:42.550
Tucker to Captain Archer.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.678
- Are you all right?
- We're fine.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.304
I don't want the Fortunate leaving.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.889
Understood.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.684
Hail them.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.728
No response.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.358
- They're charging weapons.
- Polarize the hull plating.

22:01.532 --> 22:04.577
The Fortunate
has fired its weapons.

22:04.785 --> 22:06.120
Trip, report.

22:06.328 --> 22:08.790
They're getting a little
trigger-happy, sir. Stand by.

22:08.999 --> 22:10.917
Load starboard tubes
three and four.

22:11.126 --> 22:12.335
Target their engines.

22:12.544 --> 22:13.629
Aye, sir.

22:15.381 --> 22:16.966
They're jettisoning our pod.

22:17.174 --> 22:18.719
Their warp drive is coming online.

22:18.927 --> 22:19.970
Fire.

22:25.227 --> 22:26.812
Enterprise to Archer.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.814
- How you doing, Trip?
- We're okay, sir.

22:29.022 --> 22:32.610
We didn't take too much damage,
but the Fortunate just went to warp.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.112
Follow them.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.074
Captain, considering
our rate of decompression,

22:37.283 --> 22:40.911
I'd suggest Enterprise
retrieve us as quickly as possible.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.664
Belay that, Trip.

22:42.872 --> 22:45.083
Send a shuttlepod
over here to pick us up.

22:45.292 --> 22:47.254
We've sprung a leak.

22:47.504 --> 22:49.297
On our way.

22:58.724 --> 23:00.310
We're trying to track
their warp trail,

23:00.519 --> 23:03.021
but their plasma cannon knocked out
our long-range sensors.

23:03.230 --> 23:04.816
How long till they are back online?

23:05.024 --> 23:07.235
Mr Tucker says
at least four hours.

23:07.485 --> 23:10.196
We don't know where they are,
but we know who they're looking for.

23:12.492 --> 23:15.704
The Nausicaans.
Ryan's after revenge, sir.

23:15.912 --> 23:17.707
A very primitive emotion,

23:17.915 --> 23:20.084
but it would explain
his irrational behaviour.

23:20.293 --> 23:21.794
It's rational to him.

23:22.045 --> 23:23.880
Those pirates attacked his ship.

23:24.131 --> 23:26.425
That's his family.

23:27.259 --> 23:31.389
If we wanna find the Fortunate,
we need to find the Nausicaans.

23:37.939 --> 23:39.525
The frequencies.

23:40.651 --> 23:44.363
You're not very skilled
at interrogation.

23:44.572 --> 23:47.367
I could give you some lessons.

23:50.537 --> 23:53.124
Give me the frequencies.

23:53.541 --> 23:56.210
You know my shipmates
will come for me.

23:56.753 --> 23:59.047
I'm counting on it.

24:06.181 --> 24:08.351
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

24:08.560 --> 24:10.437
You nearly killed him.

24:10.645 --> 24:12.313
Remodulate the weapons.

24:12.522 --> 24:14.066
What about the Nausicaan?

24:14.275 --> 24:16.777
Keep him locked up.
We might still need him.

24:16.986 --> 24:20.407
We've got what we wanted.
Let's just get him off the ship.

24:24.954 --> 24:26.665
How?

24:26.957 --> 24:29.001
An escape pod.

24:30.043 --> 24:32.547
So his friends can pick him up?

24:32.755 --> 24:36.509
And he can tell them to change
their shield modulations?

24:37.261 --> 24:39.680
What was the point of all this?

24:40.139 --> 24:42.934
I've been asking myself
the same question.

24:43.143 --> 24:46.813
We've always dealt with the
Nausicaans without taking hostages

24:47.021 --> 24:49.776
or beating information out of them.

24:50.777 --> 24:54.198
If we don't show them
that we're serious,

24:54.407 --> 24:57.410
they're never gonna
leave us alone.

25:02.875 --> 25:05.795
How would the captain
want us to handle this?

25:06.004 --> 25:08.965
I'm responsible for this ship now.

25:09.173 --> 25:14.723
I need to know you're gonna help me
do whatever it takes to protect her.

25:22.398 --> 25:25.360
We've taken enough casualties.

25:25.610 --> 25:29.115
It's time we start inflicting
some of our own.

25:38.001 --> 25:40.044
Captain's starlog, supplemental.

25:40.254 --> 25:43.465
We've picked up a faint warp trail
that could be the Fortunate,

25:43.674 --> 25:47.804
but we won't know for sure until our
long-range sensors are back online.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.348
Anything?

25:52.476 --> 25:54.103
No.

25:56.564 --> 25:59.276
- Try bypassing circuit L-47.
- Aye, sir.

25:59.484 --> 26:01.320
I don't know what's
going on with that guy.

26:01.529 --> 26:03.323
I can understand
taking on those pirates.

26:03.532 --> 26:05.200
I probably would've
done the same thing.

26:05.409 --> 26:07.619
But firing on a Starfleet vessel?

26:07.828 --> 26:11.124
He's got a lot more than pirates
to worry about now.

26:11.332 --> 26:14.920
Never thought I'd see a Y-Class
running from any ship I was on.

26:15.129 --> 26:16.714
When I was growing up
on the Horizon,

26:16.922 --> 26:19.341
anything that happened onboard
you handled yourself.

26:19.967 --> 26:23.430
If someone on the crew got
into a fight, you just worked it out.

26:23.638 --> 26:25.933
You took care of your own.

26:26.225 --> 26:29.312
If Starfleet showed up and told my
father what he could and couldn't do

26:29.521 --> 26:31.314
- on his own ship...
- Things are changing.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.068
Ryan's gonna
have to figure that out.

26:34.652 --> 26:38.449
Maybe he already has
and he just doesn't like it.

26:39.241 --> 26:42.161
Got it. Sensors are back online.

26:50.213 --> 26:51.840
Come in.

26:52.966 --> 26:54.926
Do you have a minute, sir?

26:55.511 --> 26:57.888
I think I can squeeze you in.

27:05.272 --> 27:07.275
What's on your mind, Travis?

27:09.944 --> 27:11.654
Permission to speak freely, sir?

27:12.488 --> 27:14.325
Anytime.

27:15.535 --> 27:19.331
I'm worried that we're not handling
the situation the right way.

27:20.207 --> 27:21.876
Go on.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.629
You know I'd never
question your orders.

27:25.213 --> 27:27.966
You served on one of those freighters.
I wanna hear your opinion.

27:29.844 --> 27:31.637
Maybe Ryan's right.

27:31.846 --> 27:34.765
Maybe this isn't any of our business.

27:35.391 --> 27:38.896
If he doesn't want our help,
why force it on him?

27:39.689 --> 27:43.527
So you think we should just
let Ryan take on the Nausicaans?

27:43.736 --> 27:46.029
Don't underestimate
a freighter crew, sir.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.325
My father never ran into any trouble
he couldn't handle himself.

27:49.534 --> 27:51.202
Nausicaans included.

27:53.330 --> 27:55.958
So, what happens
to the Nausicaans?

27:56.500 --> 27:58.169
Sir?

27:59.337 --> 28:02.925
Suppose Ryan finds the ship
that attacked him.

28:03.134 --> 28:04.720
Maybe it's been damaged,

28:04.928 --> 28:07.931
and the Fortunate is more
than a match for them.

28:08.140 --> 28:09.683
What do you think Ryan will do?

28:11.019 --> 28:14.230
He'd probably try
to blow them out of the sky.

28:16.608 --> 28:21.280
I don't know about you, Travis,
but that doesn't sit right with me.

28:21.823 --> 28:24.576
Human beings have
a code of behaviour that applies

28:24.784 --> 28:27.581
whether they're Starfleet officers
or space boomers.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.749
And it isn't driven by revenge.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.128
Just because someone
isn't born on Earth

28:33.337 --> 28:35.423
doesn't make him any less human.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.220
You're right, sir.

28:40.679 --> 28:43.515
I suppose I should understand
that more than anyone.

28:46.227 --> 28:50.482
Any other orders of mine
you'd like to question?

28:53.486 --> 28:55.405
Not today, sir.

29:00.327 --> 29:02.414
Thank you, sir.

29:17.515 --> 29:18.808
Are you sure?

29:19.017 --> 29:20.603
I've seen that hull signature enough.

29:20.811 --> 29:23.522
- The new shield frequencies?
- Loaded and standing by.

29:23.731 --> 29:27.527
Well, bring the cannons online.
Drop out of warp.

29:30.155 --> 29:31.490
They're just sitting there,

29:31.699 --> 29:34.201
a hundred kilometres ahead
near a small asteroid.

29:34.410 --> 29:36.412
Put it on the viewer.

29:39.792 --> 29:41.085
They've seen us.

29:41.335 --> 29:44.798
Lay in an intercept course.
Full impulse.

29:46.675 --> 29:48.303
We're closing.

29:48.511 --> 29:50.305
Twenty kilometres.

29:50.889 --> 29:53.057
They're firing.

29:54.143 --> 29:55.769
The hull plating is holding.

29:56.020 --> 29:59.189
- Can you get a weapons lock?
- We're out of range.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.694
Then get us into range.

30:01.902 --> 30:03.446
Ten kilometres.

30:03.654 --> 30:05.031
Nine.

30:05.239 --> 30:07.534
Cannons locked on target.

30:07.743 --> 30:09.161
Return fire.

30:11.456 --> 30:13.499
They've gone behind the asteroid.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.752
I've lost the lock.

30:31.271 --> 30:34.399
This must be where they
offload stolen cargo.

30:34.609 --> 30:36.944
- I'm getting us out of here.
- Hold your course.

30:37.153 --> 30:40.114
- Ryan...
- We still have their shield frequencies.

30:40.324 --> 30:43.410
Lock weapons
on the first ship and fire.

30:51.336 --> 30:52.839
Again.

30:54.299 --> 30:56.092
No effect.

30:56.718 --> 30:58.721
Are you sure you programmed
the right frequencies?

30:58.929 --> 31:00.514
I used the ones he gave us.

31:06.021 --> 31:07.856
Go to warp!

31:08.773 --> 31:10.192
The reactor is off-line.

31:10.735 --> 31:12.236
Full impulse then.

31:12.445 --> 31:14.698
Hull plating to maximum.

31:17.410 --> 31:19.203
We've lost impulse.

31:22.958 --> 31:24.793
They're hailing us.

31:26.796 --> 31:30.091
Our scans show you have
one of our crewmen aboard.

31:30.300 --> 31:33.095
I assume you're here to return him.

31:34.013 --> 31:35.598
He's our prisoner.

31:36.182 --> 31:38.686
He won't be for long.

31:44.943 --> 31:47.404
They've latched onto us.

32:02.380 --> 32:06.385
Captain, long-range scans
are detecting weapons fire.

32:07.762 --> 32:11.224
- Who's doing the shooting?
- It's difficult to be sure at this distance.

32:11.433 --> 32:13.561
Looks like some
kind of plasma discharge.

32:13.769 --> 32:16.522
I can't rule out our boomer friends.

32:18.107 --> 32:19.484
Lay in a course.

32:19.693 --> 32:21.445
Aye, sir.

32:34.961 --> 32:36.839
They're in the access corridor,
Section D.

32:37.048 --> 32:39.467
- How many?
- Three.

32:42.304 --> 32:43.930
Pass out weapons.

32:45.807 --> 32:48.728
We know what they're after.
Why not let them have him?

32:48.936 --> 32:52.149
We fought them off before.
We can do it again.

32:52.399 --> 32:54.569
It was one ship, not three.

32:55.236 --> 32:57.280
Weapons.

33:35.993 --> 33:37.911
We should pull back.

33:59.021 --> 34:02.065
It's the Fortunate, sir,
and three smaller ships.

34:02.275 --> 34:04.069
Nausicaans.

34:04.278 --> 34:06.697
Polarize the hull plating.

34:06.906 --> 34:08.366
Drop us out of warp.

34:13.873 --> 34:15.833
Are we in range?

34:16.333 --> 34:18.210
Two hundred thousand
kilometres ahead.

34:18.418 --> 34:20.047
Put it up.

34:23.675 --> 34:26.763
There are four Nausicaan bio-signs
onboard the Fortunate.

34:26.971 --> 34:30.100
And I'm detecting
weapon discharges.

34:33.228 --> 34:34.731
Hail the Nausicaans.

34:35.148 --> 34:36.692
Which ship, sir?

34:37.067 --> 34:38.819
Let's see who answers.

34:50.416 --> 34:53.003
We'd better get him
to the infirmary.

34:53.628 --> 34:55.840
He's gonna be okay.

34:56.549 --> 34:59.343
I told you they'd come for me.

35:05.017 --> 35:08.146
Shut up.

35:08.396 --> 35:10.732
We're involved in
a rescue operation.

35:10.982 --> 35:13.402
There's a lot of firing
going on for a rescue.

35:13.652 --> 35:15.529
We want our crewman back.

35:15.779 --> 35:19.493
He wouldn't be there if you hadn't
attacked them in the first place.

35:24.958 --> 35:26.877
Perhaps we have
an opportunity here

35:27.085 --> 35:30.798
to improve relations between
your people and mine.

35:31.049 --> 35:35.429
We're happy with our relations
the way they are.

35:35.637 --> 35:38.307
I have a proposal for you.

35:39.391 --> 35:41.479
We'll get your man back,

35:41.687 --> 35:45.107
and then you'll let the Fortunate
continue on her way.

35:45.357 --> 35:48.153
You're facing three of my ships.

35:48.361 --> 35:51.531
We are not interested
in your proposals.

35:51.782 --> 35:53.576
We've scanned your ships.

35:53.784 --> 35:55.077
Mr Reed.

35:55.328 --> 35:57.079
Fore and aft plasma cannons.

35:57.288 --> 36:00.417
I doubt those shields of theirs
would hold up to our torpedoes.

36:00.667 --> 36:04.047
You're not sneaking up
on an old freighter this time.

36:04.256 --> 36:06.842
This is an NX-Class starship.

36:07.051 --> 36:10.930
Take a good look, because
you'll be seeing more of them.

36:11.431 --> 36:17.146
Now, you can reconsider my offer,
or you can take your chances.

36:19.190 --> 36:23.320
If you think you can convince them
to return our crewman, do it quickly.

36:23.528 --> 36:27.325
Otherwise, we'll be forced
to take our chances.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.095
Enterprise to Ryan.
This is Jonathan Archer.

36:44.304 --> 36:47.557
We're 10,000 meters
of your starboard bow.

36:47.766 --> 36:49.435
I know you can hear me.

36:49.643 --> 36:52.647
Why don't you think about what's best
for your crew and let us help you?

36:53.106 --> 36:54.399
What a relief.

36:54.608 --> 36:56.861
Starfleet's come to save the day.

36:57.069 --> 36:59.655
I've spoken to
the Nausicaan captain.

36:59.864 --> 37:04.036
He's willing to let the Fortunate go
if you turn over his crewman.

37:04.536 --> 37:06.163
What, and you believe him?

37:06.371 --> 37:08.917
You believe they're gonna
let us just fly away?

37:09.125 --> 37:13.047
I've got an armoury full of torpedoes
that will make sure they do.

37:19.347 --> 37:20.890
What about next time

37:21.098 --> 37:25.103
when another freighter gets jumped
in the middle of nowhere? What then?

37:25.312 --> 37:28.899
You've got a chance to stop this
before anyone else gets hurt.

37:29.107 --> 37:32.445
I'm dealing with them
the only way they understand.

37:32.695 --> 37:35.699
One of the Nausicaan ships
has locked weapons on us, sir.

37:36.325 --> 37:38.744
This has gone on long enough.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.080
Now you're putting
my crew in danger.

37:41.290 --> 37:42.958
Release that hostage.

37:46.921 --> 37:50.133
He's my prisoner, and I'm
gonna handle this my way.

37:50.342 --> 37:51.885
What are you going
to do, kill him?

37:52.093 --> 37:54.472
Oh, you again.

37:54.889 --> 37:57.475
Sir, with your permission.

37:58.685 --> 38:01.772
You think killing one of them
is going to accomplish anything?

38:02.314 --> 38:05.903
Your captain decide a little boomer-
to-boomer talk would persuade me?

38:06.153 --> 38:07.488
Just shut up and listen to me.

38:07.696 --> 38:09.907
I don't give a damn
about you anymore.

38:10.158 --> 38:11.910
I'm just thinking about my family.

38:12.118 --> 38:14.662
What have they got to do with this?

38:15.915 --> 38:17.791
What's going to happen
to the next freighter

38:18.000 --> 38:20.211
that runs into the Nausicaans?

38:20.419 --> 38:21.713
What if it's the Horizon

38:21.922 --> 38:25.425
and they have to pay the price
for your stubborn stupidity?

38:25.634 --> 38:27.177
I'm doing this for them.

38:27.428 --> 38:28.971
The hell you are!

38:29.180 --> 38:32.142
This isn't about
protecting cargo ships.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.187
That is just what it's about.

38:34.395 --> 38:38.733
Don't kid yourself into thinking you're
doing this for some greater good.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.779
This is about revenge, nothing else.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.198
The Nausicaan ships are firing, sir.

38:46.826 --> 38:48.036
Return fire.

38:48.244 --> 38:51.081
Starboard tubes three and four.

38:51.457 --> 38:55.629
You don't like me because
I left the Horizon to join Starfleet.

38:55.837 --> 38:57.924
You're afraid that if
more people do that,

38:58.132 --> 39:00.551
there won't be anyone left
to run the freighters.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.221
Maybe you're right, maybe not.

39:03.430 --> 39:05.349
But if you don't let your hostage go,

39:05.599 --> 39:08.978
the Nausicaans are going
to kill you and your crew.

39:14.401 --> 39:17.739
Port tubes one and two. Fire.

39:17.947 --> 39:21.577
And then there'll be 23 fewer people
out here to run those freighters.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.954
No maybes.

39:32.173 --> 39:34.342
Hold your fire!

39:35.217 --> 39:36.970
Take him.

40:13.890 --> 40:16.726
The Nausicaans are powering down
their weapons.

40:17.102 --> 40:19.355
They're moving off, sir.

40:47.305 --> 40:49.140
Need a hand?

40:50.433 --> 40:51.727
Just a little stiff.

40:51.936 --> 40:54.272
Thank your doctor for me.

40:55.315 --> 41:00.071
I've got some Drilaxian whiskey
stashed away if you'd like to join me.

41:00.905 --> 41:02.281
I'm on duty.

41:04.284 --> 41:05.744
Too bad.

41:05.952 --> 41:11.334
If you've never had it, you're missing
one of the galaxy's real pleasures.

41:12.585 --> 41:15.839
I'm reducing Mr Ryan's rank
to Able Crewman.

41:16.048 --> 41:20.930
He gets to spend the rest of the trip
purging hydraulic pumps.

41:21.597 --> 41:24.892
If you think he's gonna be a problem,
we could take him back to Earth.

41:25.142 --> 41:28.021
No. We take care of our own.

41:28.605 --> 41:32.109
Besides, that would
leave me a man short.

41:32.943 --> 41:34.779
Understood.

41:35.654 --> 41:39.493
I made him my first officer
because I trusted him with my ship.

41:39.993 --> 41:42.287
It's gonna take him quite
a while to earn that back.

41:42.537 --> 41:44.541
His intentions were good,

41:44.750 --> 41:49.631
but someone should teach him
to accept help when it's offered.

41:50.965 --> 41:56.472
The ones that grew up out here
feel they have some special claim,

41:56.680 --> 41:58.933
that this particular stretch
of space is theirs.

41:59.600 --> 42:04.022
They see another ship within
ten light-years, they get jumpy.

42:04.272 --> 42:08.111
They're gonna be seeing a lot
more ships than they're used to.

42:09.738 --> 42:11.531
The ships get faster.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.910
It's progress, I suppose.

42:14.660 --> 42:18.582
My family's been on the Fortunate
for three generations.

42:18.791 --> 42:22.044
Now, I'm going to need at least
a warp-3 engine to stay in business.

42:23.128 --> 42:25.256
Maybe that's not so bad.

42:25.465 --> 42:28.092
At warp 3, help's a lot closer
than before.

42:28.301 --> 42:29.929
You won't have to go it alone.

42:30.179 --> 42:32.891
Going it alone is all I've ever done.

42:33.099 --> 42:37.146
And for some of us,
it's the reason we're out here.

42:37.355 --> 42:40.024
A chance to prove ourselves.

42:41.067 --> 42:42.569
I think you've already done that.

42:43.236 --> 42:45.864
Well, we'll adapt.

42:46.073 --> 42:47.909
We always have.

42:48.159 --> 42:50.995
But things just won't be the same.

42:54.083 --> 42:55.919
Good luck.

42:59.048 --> 43:01.467
Sure you won't join me
for that drink?

43:02.676 --> 43:06.848
Thanks, but my crew's anxious
to get under way.

43:07.182 --> 43:08.975
Next time.
