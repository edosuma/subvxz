WEBVTT

03:10.648 --> 03:12.065
Agent Cooper.

03:12.233 --> 03:15.819
Can you hear me? It's Andy.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.865
Agent Cooper, it's Andy.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.035
Can you hear me?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.745
Agent Cooper?

03:31.252 --> 03:32.878
Room service.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.729
How are you doing down there?

03:56.152 --> 03:58.403
Warm milk.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.697
Agent Cooper?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.786
Would you put it on the table, please?

04:06.746 --> 04:10.332
- And would you call a doctor?
- Sure.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.252
Are you all right? Can you hear me?

04:13.419 --> 04:16.672
Agent Cooper.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.884
Agent Cooper, it's Andy.
Can you hear me?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.096
Are you all right?

04:24.472 --> 04:27.432
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.351
Agent Cooper.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.812
It's Andy.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.357
It's An...

04:42.323 --> 04:44.157
I hung it up for you.

04:48.871 --> 04:49.997
What's that?

04:51.165 --> 04:53.750
Hung it up for you.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.045
Did you call the doctor?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.636
The doctor?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.391
It's hung up.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.684
The phone.

05:13.479 --> 05:14.896
Thank you.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.274
Sure.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.027
No problem.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.338
Does this include a gratuity?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.091
Yes, sir.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.564
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

06:07.283 --> 06:10.535
The milk will get cool on you.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.790
- Pretty soon.
- Okay.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.055
I've heard about you.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.341
I heard about you.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.929
I will tell you three things.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.809
If I tell them to you
and they come true,

08:39.977 --> 08:42.229
then will you believe me?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.232
Who's that?

08:45.900 --> 08:49.319
Think of me as a friend.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.282
Where do you come from?

08:57.370 --> 09:02.457
The question is,
where have you gone?

09:04.710 --> 09:09.005
The first thing I will tell you is,

09:09.173 --> 09:13.051
there's a man

09:13.219 --> 09:16.680
in a smiling bag.

09:18.140 --> 09:21.476
Man in a smiling bag.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.313
Second thing is,

09:25.481 --> 09:30.318
the owls are not what they seem.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.699
Third thing is,

09:35.866 --> 09:41.162
without chemicals, he points.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.958
What do these things mean?

09:45.167 --> 09:48.670
This is all I am permitted to say.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.214
Give me your ring.

09:51.382 --> 09:57.137
I will return it to you
when you find these things to be true.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.569
We want to help you.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.655
Who's "we"?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.241
One last thing.

10:18.784 --> 10:24.372
Leo locked inside hungry horse.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.250
There's a clue at Leo's house.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.342
You will require medical attention.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.330
Knock, knock, knock.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.961
Come on.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.382
Let's have a look at the new girl.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.386
Ow, mm.

11:19.595 --> 11:20.637
Vixen.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.390
What room is Ben in?

11:26.727 --> 11:29.604
The little flower room.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.190
- Why is he holding out on me?
- What?

11:32.358 --> 11:36.611
- Why is he holding out on me?
- What's that, Blackie?

11:37.738 --> 11:40.198
Who's holding out on who?

11:42.743 --> 11:43.868
Please.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.414
Oh, Blackie.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.760
You used to be so pretty.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.725
Blackie, Blackie.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.782
Bastard.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.294
I think you should go now.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.672
- Do you, Prudence?
- Yes, I do. I really do.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.299
Hmm.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.761
All right.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.638
If you insist.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.286
Gotcha. Ha, ha!

13:08.996 --> 13:11.289
I will huff

13:11.457 --> 13:13.792
and puff,

13:13.959 --> 13:18.463
and blow your house down.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.508
Oh, my, my.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.178
Aren't you something?

13:27.014 --> 13:29.724
I've got to see you. I must see you.

13:29.892 --> 13:34.062
Go away. I'm shy.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.731
Didn't they tell you who I was?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.733
The owner?

13:38.901 --> 13:40.652
That's right.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.738
Ben, it's Jer. We got a situation.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.073
So have I.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.700
Brother Ben, we got a S-N-A-G.

13:47.868 --> 13:51.704
- Alas, I do have a situation.
- Come on, Ben.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.331
Coming, Jer.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.458
I like you.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.796
You know how to interest a man.
That's half the battle.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.591
Next time,
we will play a different game.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.135
I'll make the rules.

14:06.303 --> 14:09.681
You'll like it. Fun game.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.352
Everybody wins.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.517
Diane.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.647
My recorder is on the table.

15:00.274 --> 15:04.027
I'm unable to reach it at this time.

15:04.612 --> 15:08.364
I can only hope
that I inadvertently pressed

15:08.532 --> 15:10.742
the voice-activation button.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.746
I'm lying on the floor of my room.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.081
I've been shot.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.879
There's a great deal of pain
and a fair amount of blood.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.926
Fortunately, I was wearing
my bulletproof vest last night,

15:28.093 --> 15:32.305
per bureau regulations
when working undercover.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.308
I remember folding the vest up,

15:35.476 --> 15:38.603
trying to chase down a wood tick.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.026
If you can imagine the impact
on your chest

15:45.194 --> 15:48.947
of three bowling balls dropped
from a height of about 9 feet,

15:49.114 --> 15:52.951
you might begin
to approximate the sensation.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.998
All things considered,

15:59.208 --> 16:04.045
being shot is not as bad
as I always thought it might be.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.882
As long as you can keep
the fear from your mind.

16:09.218 --> 16:14.639
But I guess you could say that
about almost anything in life.

16:15.182 --> 16:19.769
It's not so bad as long as you can keep
the fear from your mind.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.907
Oh, my God.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.535
The ring is gone.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.879
At a time like this, curiously,

16:47.047 --> 16:50.633
you begin to think
of the things you regret

16:50.801 --> 16:53.261
or the things you might miss.

16:55.431 --> 17:00.601
I would like, in general, to treat people
with much more care and respect.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.564
I would like to climb a tall hill.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.983
Not too tall.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.736
Sit in the cool grass.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.946
Not too cool.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.241
And feel the sun on my face.

17:16.744 --> 17:21.581
I wish I could have cracked
the Lindbergh kidnapping case.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.586
I would very much like
to make love to a beautiful woman

17:26.754 --> 17:29.881
who I had genuine affection for.

17:31.508 --> 17:36.888
And of course, it goes without saying
that I would like to visit Tibet.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.934
I wish they could get their country back
and the Dalai Lama could return.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.271
Oh, I would like that very much.

17:48.692 --> 17:52.195
All in all,
a very interesting experience.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.037
They're here.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.171
My skin was itching.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.883
Wood tick was crawling.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.679
I lifted my bulletproof vest.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.515
Three slugs.

18:20.682 --> 18:23.142
Point-blank range.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.811
That explains this.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.608
Hell of a way to kill a tick.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.446
Did you get a look at the gunman?

18:39.743 --> 18:44.163
I saw a masked face, muzzle flash.

18:46.959 --> 18:52.004
Lucy, you better bring Agent Cooper
up-to-date.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.884
Leo Johnson was shot.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.387
Jacques Renault was strangled.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.266
The mill burned.
Shelly and Pete got smoke inhalation.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.601
Catherine and Josie are missing.

19:05.769 --> 19:09.647
Nadine is in a coma
from taking sleeping pills.

19:13.152 --> 19:17.405
- How long have I been out?
-  It's 7:45 in the morning.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.699
We haven't had this much action
in one night

19:19.867 --> 19:22.285
since the Elk's Club fire of '59.

19:23.412 --> 19:28.374
Harry, we need to get a search warrant
for Leo Johnson's house.

19:28.584 --> 19:32.545
No need. Leo was shot
in his own living room.

19:32.713 --> 19:36.174
Deputy Brennan found him.

19:40.470 --> 19:44.640
- You're not going anywhere.
- Doc. When the will is invoked,

19:44.808 --> 19:48.769
the recuperative powers of the physical
body are simply extraordinary.

19:55.235 --> 19:58.779
Just give me a couple of hours
to get dressed.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.963
I'm standing just in front of
where a massive log-storage area

20:16.131 --> 20:18.758
of the Packard Saw Mill
burned to the ground,

20:18.926 --> 20:21.844
under what fire department
investigators are calling

20:22.012 --> 20:23.763
"mysterious circumstances."

20:26.058 --> 20:28.851
Now, police officials have
told me that they have, as of yet,

20:29.019 --> 20:31.395
- Bobby.
- uncovered no apparent link

20:31.563 --> 20:33.439
between these two
seemingly unrelated

20:33.607 --> 20:35.066
- Bobby.
- tragedies.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.568
Reporting live
from the Packard Saw Mill...

20:37.778 --> 20:40.321
Cooper, this is totally against
my recommendations.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.031
It's all right, doc. Duly noted.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.700
You got two busted ribs,
your cartilage is a mess.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.286
Who knows what else is wrong?

20:48.538 --> 20:50.331
What's that?

20:51.708 --> 20:53.834
Jacques Renault.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.379
Is that bag smiling?

20:57.965 --> 20:59.882
Smiling?

21:01.343 --> 21:04.262
What's there to smile about?

22:32.100 --> 22:33.142
Do you miss Beth?

22:34.603 --> 22:35.686
What?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.774
Have you been missing your mom?

22:44.404 --> 22:47.114
- Aunt Sarah?
- Yeah?

22:47.324 --> 22:49.617
I had the strangest dream last night.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.661
About what?

22:56.166 --> 22:58.209
The rug.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.418
Right here.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.464
Right from this angle
where I'm sitting.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.800
Was Laura in it?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.969
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats

23:09.137 --> 23:12.556
And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.476
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey

23:15.685 --> 23:17.561
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

23:17.771 --> 23:20.648
Now, if the words sound queer
And funny to your ear

23:20.816 --> 23:22.691
A little bit jumbled and jivey

23:22.859 --> 23:25.820
Say, "Mares eat oats
And does eat oats

23:26.029 --> 23:30.741
And little lambs eat ivy"

23:30.909 --> 23:32.326
Leland?

23:32.494 --> 23:36.747
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey

23:36.915 --> 23:48.676
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

23:51.138 --> 23:52.138
Morning, dears.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.889
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats

23:54.057 --> 23:55.057
And liddle lamzy divey

23:55.225 --> 23:56.559
Oh, Leland.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.436
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.522
Leland, come back here.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.587
Oh, God.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.719
Okay. Agenda.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.596
One.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.556
I want a location on Catherine.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.685
Keep our distance, just make sure
she's ready to take the fall.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.187
Two.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.606
I want a complete medical
on Leo Johnson

24:43.773 --> 24:45.399
and his prospects for recovery

24:45.567 --> 24:49.195
and a satisfactory explanation
from Hank Jennings

24:49.362 --> 24:53.616
why Leo isn't being measured
for a plot in Ghostwood Memorial Park.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.619
Well begun is half done.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.704
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats

24:58.872 --> 25:02.208
And liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

25:02.375 --> 25:05.252
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And liddle lamzy divey

25:05.420 --> 25:07.546
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

25:07.714 --> 25:10.883
Now, if the words sound queer
And funny to your ear

25:11.051 --> 25:13.511
A little bit jumbled and jivey

25:13.678 --> 25:17.556
Say, "Mares eat oats
And does eat oats

25:17.724 --> 25:21.810
And little lambs eat ivy"

25:23.897 --> 25:26.065
I'm back.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.442
Back and ready.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.826
But the bullet came from outside.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.248
How do you figure?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.917
Sheriff, a picture is forming.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.795
Big ax on the couch.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.006
These same geese were flying
that evening.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.551
Leo was trying to turn someone
into kindling.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.511
That person hit the TV, moved it.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.013
You can see the depression
in the carpet.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.599
Shelly?

26:00.767 --> 26:03.310
Shelly Johnson's about 99 pounds
soaking wet.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.187
This is a big TV.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.606
Leo advanced, ax raised.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.942
Then what happened?

26:10.110 --> 26:13.988
Bullet came through the window,
knocked Leo back onto the couch.

26:14.197 --> 26:17.116
Do you think it was Shelly
who pulled the trigger?

26:17.284 --> 26:20.911
Sheriff, get your mind off Shelly,
for a moment.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.206
We won't know about Shelly until we
find out what time she got to the mill.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.838
Surprise. Flesh World.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.881
Hey, what issue is this?

26:33.049 --> 26:35.634
Still no cocaine. Here or in the truck.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.344
But I found this in the truck.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.513
Leo's duster.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.517
- Reeks of gasoline.
- The mill.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.730
Good work, Hawk.

26:55.488 --> 26:58.073
Harry, do you know who it is?

26:58.241 --> 27:00.159
Harry, do you know who it is?

27:00.327 --> 27:02.119
- Harry.
- What's that?

27:02.329 --> 27:05.039
- Harry, do you know who it is?
- It's Andy.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.999
He seems pretty upset
about something.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.961
Harry, it's Agent Rosenflower.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.686
Andy, are you all right?

27:31.316 --> 27:32.983
Hey, Andy.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.610
Are you all right?

27:51.670 --> 27:54.838
And it's another great moment
in law enforcement history.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.524
Hey, Albert.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.569
Looks like you were more right
than you know.

28:21.574 --> 28:25.160
Looks like a new pair of boots
and a lot of cocaine.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.709
Andy.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.296
Good work.

28:53.022 --> 28:56.483
Hot damn that pie is good!

29:15.462 --> 29:17.796
Here's Laura's glasses
that you wanted.

29:21.426 --> 29:52.748
Thanks.

30:00.173 --> 30:04.009
Donna, do you see these glasses
that I'm wearing?

30:04.177 --> 30:05.677
Yeah.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.020
I hate them.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.316
I'm never wearing these again.

30:22.695 --> 30:23.737
Okay.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.163
Is it true about James?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.296
He spent the night in jail.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.008
Do you think
it's because of what we did?

30:46.636 --> 30:48.971
Look, we don't know
if we did anything.

30:49.138 --> 30:52.850
My dad said Jacoby got sick
because he was attacked.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.935
All we did was send him a tape.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.981
Maybe he wouldn't have been attacked
if we hadn't.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.900
Maybe. Maybe the sun won't come
up tomorrow if you wash your hair.

31:02.068 --> 31:05.153
Think like that and you're gonna
go crazy. What's done is done.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.825
The only way this won't come back
to haunt us

31:09.993 --> 31:12.786
is if we keep quiet
about what happened last night.

31:14.622 --> 31:18.000
I can assure you
James is doing the same thing.

31:22.797 --> 31:23.839
Get the picture?

31:25.383 --> 31:27.092
Loud and clear.

31:33.766 --> 31:37.853
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.399
Really?

31:43.735 --> 31:45.736
White as a sheet.

31:48.531 --> 31:49.615
Weird.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.578
Donna, I have something for you.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.539
Came here to the Double R
yesterday.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.792
Thanks, Norma.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.350
- God.
- What is it?

32:23.274 --> 32:26.944
"Look into the Meals on Wheels."

33:00.228 --> 33:02.312
How simple can I make it, Cooper?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.898
FBI agent gets shot,
FBI agent investigates.

33:05.066 --> 33:08.443
I'm in proximity, work in the Seattle lab,
I'm familiar with the underlying case.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.862
- Ugh! Yes.
- Does that hurt?

33:11.030 --> 33:14.783
Albert, the point is, you're not gonna
win any local popularity contests.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.412
No, the point is
Gordon Cole ordered me back here.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.165
Breathe.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.421
Again.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.341
Okay.

33:32.135 --> 33:35.804
You were shot by a right-handed
person, 5'6"to 5'10" tall,

33:36.014 --> 33:39.016
at a distance of less than 3 feet.
I'll have ballistics this afternoon.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.601
- You're still blank on the other details?
- Yes.

33:41.811 --> 33:44.021
What was your vest doing
riding up like that?

33:44.564 --> 33:45.731
Wood tick.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.652
Meanwhile, one of your principle
suspects is killed in his hospital bed,

33:50.820 --> 33:52.654
the other is shot in his living room.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.157
Vigilante justice
or just clean country living?

33:55.867 --> 33:59.202
Albert, where does this attitude of
general unpleasantness come from?

33:59.412 --> 34:01.204
I'll have to get back to you on that.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.498
If you don't want two black eyes
on a regular basis,

34:03.666 --> 34:06.501
I suggest you make
some kind of peace with rural life.

34:06.711 --> 34:10.130
Great. After the square dance,
maybe we can all take a hayride.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.924
Come in.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.304
Andy, how's the nose?

34:17.805 --> 34:20.515
Not a mark on it,
only blood squirted out.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.476
Where do they keep his water dish?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.187
Albert.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.440
Agent Cooper, guess what.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.234
I have the answer to the riddle
that you told me this morning.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.737
I called Hungry Horse, Montana.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.781
The word "locked."

34:35.948 --> 34:40.744
Leo Johnson was locked in a jail
in Hungry Horse, Montana.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.205
When, Andy?

34:51.672 --> 34:55.342
"February 9, 1988."

34:58.012 --> 34:59.930
Teresa Banks.

35:00.848 --> 35:05.685
Looks like Leo has an alibi for the night
Teresa Banks was murdered.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.356
Good work, Andy.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.983
Yeah. Woof.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.470
Excuse me.

35:42.390 --> 35:46.393
- Is Sheriff Truman here?
- He is, but he is busy at the moment.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.896
May I help you?

35:51.983 --> 35:55.110
I'm afraid
I don't have an appointment.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.904
The sheriff asked me to stop by

35:58.072 --> 36:00.157
at my convenience.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.159
This is the first convenient moment.
Heh.

36:03.703 --> 36:06.037
May I ask what this is regarding?

36:08.124 --> 36:11.960
I'm here to sell him some shoes.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.684
Shoes?

36:28.686 --> 36:30.687
Uh-oh. Here comes Mom

36:30.855 --> 36:32.898
with milk and cookies.

36:33.065 --> 36:34.774
Later, Lawrence.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.568
Bye-bye.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.699
You got this tape
from Dr. Jacoby's office?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.034
Yeah.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.453
That's breaking and entering, James.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.913
The door was open.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.123
How did you know
Jacoby wouldn't be there?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.584
I knocked, nobody answered.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.546
- You were alone?
- Yeah.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.177
Okay. I know you were trying to help,

37:02.345 --> 37:04.930
but there's some people
who might not see it that way.

37:05.139 --> 37:08.058
Especially with 3 ounces of cocaine
in your gas tank.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.101
You know I didn't put that there.

37:10.269 --> 37:12.646
I think it was probably
Mike and Bobby.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.814
- Yeah.
- Harry,

37:15.024 --> 37:17.609
Laura talks on her tape
about a mystery man.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.403
A red Corvette. Leo Johnson.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.114
I think it was somebody else.
Not Jacques Renault either.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.824
Why do you say that?

37:25.368 --> 37:27.202
I never put it together
until I heard the tape.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.038
Where she says,
"This guy can really light my fire."

37:30.748 --> 37:34.918
Well, I remember this one night when
we first started seeing each other.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.711
She was still doing drugs then.

37:37.380 --> 37:41.841
Well, we were in the woods and
she started saying this scary poem,

37:42.009 --> 37:44.135
over and over, about fire.

37:45.012 --> 37:46.346
And then she said:

37:46.555 --> 37:49.307
"Would you like to play with fire,
little boy?"

37:49.475 --> 37:55.313
"Would you like to play with Bob?"

37:57.733 --> 38:00.860
- What did she mean by that?
- I don't know.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.780
Laura said a lot of nutty stuff.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.534
Half the time,
it just went right by you.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.286
This stuck, though.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.128
James, I'll get right to the point.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.172
I know you have the other half
of Laura Palmer's necklace.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.925
I want it. Give it to me.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.928
How?

38:29.223 --> 38:32.100
Well, this was in Jacoby's office.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.565
It was in a coconut.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.318
A coconut?

38:43.612 --> 38:46.489
Hawk, take James back to his cell.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.619
Jacoby?

38:51.787 --> 38:55.165
How did you know
he had the necklace?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.625
Laura and James were in love.

38:57.793 --> 39:00.503
I figured he had to have
the other half of the necklace,

39:00.671 --> 39:02.047
but if he had the other half,

39:02.214 --> 39:05.175
he would have given it to us
to help with the case.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.427
Then it dawned on me.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.972
Something or someone
frightened him off.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.808
He had to have it,
so I asked him for it.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.227
Jacoby?

39:17.271 --> 39:21.274
I didn't figure he had anything
to do with this at all.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.445
Sometimes you just get lucky.

39:50.012 --> 39:51.513
Donna?

39:53.224 --> 39:55.058
Hi, Lucy.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.940
I'm here to see James.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.015
How are you doing?

40:37.893 --> 40:39.769
Did you tell them anything?

40:40.271 --> 40:43.022
They haven't asked me anything.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.986
When did you start smoking?

40:51.490 --> 40:54.200
I smoke every once in a while.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.662
Helps relieve tension.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.748
When did you get so tense?

41:01.792 --> 41:04.085
When I started smoking.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.797
Did you tell them anything?

41:09.049 --> 41:11.134
I didn't tell them about you or Maddy.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.179
Do they think Leo killed Laura?

41:14.680 --> 41:16.931
I don't know what they think.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.600
How is Maddy?

41:23.189 --> 41:24.814
She's fine.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.776
She hasn't said anything either.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.119
So don't you wanna kiss me?

41:50.049 --> 41:51.049
What's wrong?

41:51.675 --> 41:53.510
Nothing's wrong.

42:04.897 --> 42:08.107
Or is it just not okay
for me to want you?

42:12.404 --> 42:15.156
Get out soon, James.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.027
Lucy.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.738
Andy.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.785
In these boxes
is every edition of Flesh World

43:00.953 --> 43:03.830
published for the past three years.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.624
This is a picture of Teresa Banks,
the first victim,

43:06.792 --> 43:10.295
who was found murdered a year ago
in the southern part of the state.

43:10.462 --> 43:13.965
Now, Laura and Ronette's photographs
appeared in ads in the magazines.

43:14.133 --> 43:18.469
You want us to look for a picture
of Teresa Banks.

43:18.637 --> 43:20.847
Andy, you're way ahead of me.

43:21.015 --> 43:24.142
Lucy, Sheriff Truman and I
will be at the hospital.

43:24.310 --> 43:26.060
Behave yourselves.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.649
Diane, just received the back issues
of Flesh World. Good work.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.651
It's nice to see some cooperation
with the law,

43:33.819 --> 43:36.779
especially from a company
that preys on human weaknesses.

43:39.366 --> 43:45.371
Lucy, I sure feel uncomfortable
being in this situation with you.

43:45.539 --> 43:49.208
Why? We're both professionals.

43:59.053 --> 44:01.679
Is he on something?

44:02.139 --> 44:04.557
Only what you prescribed.

44:09.355 --> 44:13.066
I think he did take
a little bit of his food.

44:13.233 --> 44:15.735
My God, could that be it?

44:26.372 --> 44:28.414
Agent Cooper.

44:28.582 --> 44:30.208
Why don't you tell the psychiatrist

44:30.376 --> 44:33.753
about your broken ribs
and torn cartilage.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.717
Well, well, well.

44:43.639 --> 44:44.889
What happened to you?

44:46.600 --> 44:51.437
I don't want any baloney, magic tricks
or psychological mumbo jumbo.

44:51.605 --> 44:54.816
I want you to tell us
how you came into possession of this

44:55.234 --> 44:59.779
or I am gonna have to place you
under arrest for obstruction of justice.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.664
Look, I told you.

45:09.832 --> 45:13.626
The night after Laura died,
I followed a man in a red Corvette.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.503
Leo Johnson.

45:17.423 --> 45:18.756
Correct.

45:18.924 --> 45:24.137
Then he eluded me somewhere
near the old sawmill road.

45:24.722 --> 45:28.641
As I sat there, cursing my...

45:28.809 --> 45:31.853
My lack of horsepower,

45:32.020 --> 45:34.564
a motorcycle drove by.

45:35.315 --> 45:38.192
Followed by a police cruiser.

45:38.694 --> 45:40.111
But you lost them.

45:41.071 --> 45:42.780
They went into the woods.

45:43.657 --> 45:47.744
I saw them.
I followed them in there on foot.

45:48.620 --> 45:52.290
- James and Donna?
- Yes, they...

45:52.458 --> 45:56.043
They spoke intently for a while, but
I couldn't hear what they were saying.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.797
I remember it was...

45:59.965 --> 46:02.800
It was a cold night in the woods.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.636
Finally, they...

46:05.804 --> 46:09.223
They buried something in the ground,
under a rock.

46:15.564 --> 46:18.733
Ill-advisedly, perhaps,

46:18.901 --> 46:20.902
I took it as a keepsake.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.868
It was her, you see.

46:29.995 --> 46:32.121
The necklace.

46:32.289 --> 46:34.457
A divided heart.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.669
Laura was...

46:38.837 --> 46:39.921
Was, in fact...

46:40.088 --> 46:42.465
Well, she was living a double life.

46:42.674 --> 46:44.383
Two people.

46:45.761 --> 46:47.720
Yeah, but then...

46:48.806 --> 46:54.060
Then when I saw her
that last time, she...

46:54.228 --> 46:57.605
I don't know, she seemed
to have reached a kind of...

46:57.773 --> 46:59.899
A peace with herself.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.860
Now I believe that

47:03.070 --> 47:06.030
what she had in fact arrived at

47:06.198 --> 47:08.658
was a decision to end her life.

47:09.159 --> 47:12.453
Are you saying Laura wanted to die?

47:12.663 --> 47:13.788
Doctor,

47:14.998 --> 47:17.458
Laura Palmer did not
commit suicide.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.961
No, no.

47:20.128 --> 47:25.049
But maybe she allowed herself
to be killed.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.108
One more thing.

47:42.276 --> 47:45.903
You were in intensive care last night
when Jacques Renault was killed.

47:46.572 --> 47:49.907
Yeah, yes.
But I mean, come on, fellows.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.076
I was heavily sedated and...

47:52.244 --> 47:54.871
Did you see anything?
Hear anything?

47:55.038 --> 48:00.459
I remember hearing
a fire alarm go off, but...

48:03.672 --> 48:05.548
It's...

48:05.716 --> 48:08.175
It's all like a...

48:08.343 --> 48:10.845
Like a dream.

48:15.392 --> 48:16.642
There was a smell.

48:18.312 --> 48:22.565
Yeah, there was a peculiar smell.

48:23.442 --> 48:28.446
It's usual in case of strangulation
for the victim to void his bowels.

48:36.538 --> 48:38.414
No.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.917
No, that wasn't it, this...

48:43.378 --> 48:45.880
This was a smell like...

48:47.925 --> 48:49.425
Like oil.

48:53.597 --> 48:56.807
Scorched engine oil.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.772
Dr. Bradley, call the operator.

49:02.940 --> 49:06.609
Dr. Bradley,
call the operator, please.

49:28.799 --> 49:31.050
Hey, sleeping beauty.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.595
Bobby.

49:42.688 --> 49:45.982
What are you doing here?
What if someone sees you?

49:46.149 --> 49:51.237
I don't care. I do not care anymore.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.615
Leo's in the hospital.

49:54.783 --> 49:56.283
Somebody shot him.

49:56.451 --> 50:01.580
Yeah, I know. I mean,
I heard there's cops outside his room.

50:01.748 --> 50:05.042
- Really?
- I hear they're gonna bust him.

50:05.210 --> 50:08.838
He must have got caught
doing something, poor bastard.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.093
What happened to you?

50:15.887 --> 50:19.682
Bobby, I'm so afraid.

50:20.559 --> 50:22.393
Leo tried to kill me.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.062
He knows about us.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.275
He took me up to the mill,

50:29.443 --> 50:32.611
and he tied me up
and started the fire.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.906
Bobby,

50:36.074 --> 50:38.034
he told me he was gonna kill you.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.995
Fat chance.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.540
I won't let him hurt us anymore.

50:48.962 --> 50:51.464
Are you all right?

50:54.134 --> 50:56.343
Doctors seem to think so.

50:58.555 --> 51:04.060
You know, Shelly,
hospitals are dangerous places.

51:04.227 --> 51:07.396
First of all, they're crawling
with sick people.

51:07.564 --> 51:10.816
And second of all,
that food can kill you.

51:11.860 --> 51:15.738
So if you wanna
get out of here pronto,

51:15.906 --> 51:19.033
you're gonna have to let Bobby
be your doctor.

51:20.285 --> 51:25.414
So let's just have a look here,
Miss Shelly.

51:28.835 --> 51:33.798
Oh, you seem to be
coming along splendidly.

51:35.675 --> 51:37.468
Deep breath.

51:42.015 --> 51:45.684
I'd say you're on your way
to a complete recovery.

51:56.988 --> 51:58.823
You better go.

52:01.576 --> 52:03.410
You're my girl.

52:06.414 --> 52:07.456
Bobby.

52:10.836 --> 52:12.419
I love you.

52:17.259 --> 52:21.554
I guess I love you too.

52:35.819 --> 52:39.905
Yeah, I guess I love you too.

52:50.333 --> 52:51.333
Bobby Briggs.

52:54.254 --> 52:57.965
- What's he doing here?
- He doesn't look sick.

52:58.133 --> 53:01.260
Sheriff Truman, to see this kind
of investigative genius at work,

53:01.428 --> 53:03.512
it's just a real treat for me.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.186
Ed.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.482
How are you doing?
I heard you stopped a couple.

53:15.650 --> 53:18.694
I'm okay. How's Nadine?

53:19.404 --> 53:21.155
Well, she's in a coma.

53:21.323 --> 53:24.116
They say there's nothing we could do.
She has to wanna come back.

53:24.284 --> 53:25.868
How are you holding up?

53:26.036 --> 53:28.245
Well, all I can do is sit here,

53:28.413 --> 53:30.998
thinking about the things
I should have said or done.

53:31.166 --> 53:33.709
Ed, don't be too hard on yourself.

53:35.003 --> 53:37.588
I never believed in fate,
Agent Cooper.

53:37.756 --> 53:39.006
I always felt

53:39.174 --> 53:42.885
you make your own way, you take care
of your own, you pick up after yourself.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.387
Farmer's Almanac?

53:45.555 --> 53:48.307
Albert, I would like to speak to Ed.

53:48.475 --> 53:51.435
Albert, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.148
Take a seat, Ed.

53:59.444 --> 54:01.153
I saw this coming.

54:01.321 --> 54:03.030
I didn't wanna believe it.

54:03.240 --> 54:06.492
What's worse is I'm sitting thinking
that maybe there's a part of me

54:06.660 --> 54:09.036
that didn't wanna stop her.

54:09.204 --> 54:10.913
And that's a full load.

54:12.415 --> 54:14.416
When did you get married, Ed?

54:14.584 --> 54:16.835
Right out of high school.

54:17.045 --> 54:19.171
Norma and I had been together
about four years.

54:19.339 --> 54:23.425
Everybody figured we'd get hitched.
That'd be that.

54:23.593 --> 54:26.095
I barely knew Nadine to say hello to.

54:27.138 --> 54:29.890
That spring, one bad weekend,

54:30.600 --> 54:32.559
Norma ran off with Hank.

54:32.727 --> 54:35.020
I was so twisted up inside,
I couldn't see straight.

54:36.773 --> 54:38.023
When I opened my eyes,

54:38.817 --> 54:40.901
there was Nadine,
right in front of me.

54:42.028 --> 54:44.363
There was something so sweet,

54:44.572 --> 54:47.032
so helpless about her.

54:48.576 --> 54:49.910
We drove all night.

54:50.078 --> 54:54.498
Ended up in some little town
in Montana, out past Great Falls,

54:54.666 --> 54:56.000
and I asked her to marry me.

54:57.460 --> 55:02.214
Half joking, half drunk, half crazy.

55:02.382 --> 55:04.675
It was light before we found
a justice of the peace.

55:05.885 --> 55:07.011
And Norma...

55:07.595 --> 55:10.097
Well, she hadn't even
slept with Hank.

55:10.849 --> 55:13.183
The look on her face
when she found out...

55:15.478 --> 55:19.940
Nadine and I, we went up to my dad's
old cabin up in Eagle Pass.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.234
Honeymoon.

55:22.402 --> 55:25.154
I was hoping maybe we'd get around
to talking about a divorce,

55:26.031 --> 55:28.240
annulment, something.

55:28.408 --> 55:30.909
But Nadine was so happy.

55:33.371 --> 55:34.955
And you know, by golly,

55:35.123 --> 55:37.583
I shot out Nadine's eye
on that honeymoon.

55:39.794 --> 55:41.086
What do you mean, Ed?

55:42.547 --> 55:44.381
The first day,
we were hunting pheasant.

55:44.591 --> 55:48.260
Nadine's a crack shot
and we already had a couple of birds.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.262
And I felt good shooting.

55:50.430 --> 55:54.600
Listening to the sound echoing,
roll down those hills.

55:54.768 --> 55:56.143
I fired.

55:56.311 --> 56:00.189
A piece of buckshot skipped off a rock
and caught Nadine square in the eye.

56:01.024 --> 56:02.858
Man, that's a tough one.

56:03.068 --> 56:05.277
She laid across my lap
as we drove back to town.

56:07.113 --> 56:08.822
She never cried.

56:09.240 --> 56:11.367
She never blamed me.

56:11.534 --> 56:14.203
She never hated me for it.

56:16.081 --> 56:18.874
Couple of months later,
Norma married Hank.

56:19.042 --> 56:23.045
So I don't believe in fate.
You make your bed, you sleep in it.

56:24.506 --> 56:26.173
Sorry.

56:27.300 --> 56:29.593
Ed, someone here to see you.

56:52.700 --> 56:55.244
A man in a smiling bag.

57:05.088 --> 57:08.882
Take James right back to the station
when you're done here.

57:10.093 --> 57:12.010
Poor Ed.

57:12.178 --> 57:14.138
Poor Nadine.

57:14.931 --> 57:17.474
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:18.226 --> 57:19.935
Albert, why don't you
take this opportunity

57:20.103 --> 57:22.521
to check in at The Great Northern?

57:29.654 --> 57:33.532
Nurse, I really mean it,
you better speak to that kitchen.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.638
Harry, when Albert finishes up
at The Great Northern,

57:56.806 --> 57:58.223
we'll meet back at the station.

57:58.391 --> 58:00.851
I'm ready to lay the whole thing out.

58:01.019 --> 58:02.227
Rocks and bottles?

58:02.395 --> 58:05.230
Chalk and blackboard
will be just fine.

58:05.398 --> 58:08.775
- Jelly doughnuts?
- Harry, that goes without saying.

58:08.943 --> 58:11.987
I'll come back later
and I'll bring some soup.

58:12.155 --> 58:15.073
The food in these places will kill you
quicker than most diseases.

58:15.241 --> 58:17.242
Heh. So I hear.

58:17.410 --> 58:19.369
Now, you know
I have a sweet tooth too.

58:20.038 --> 58:22.206
I've got
a chocolate-peanut butter pie.

58:22.373 --> 58:24.833
Norma, I'm serious.

58:25.001 --> 58:27.294
Bring the whole pie.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.506
I'll bring you two.

58:31.216 --> 58:32.508
Okay.

58:33.968 --> 58:36.512
- Feel better, sweetie.
- Bye.

58:37.013 --> 58:39.223
Bye.

59:40.285 --> 59:41.910
Son.

59:45.581 --> 59:47.207
Dad.

59:48.793 --> 59:51.628
Would you

59:51.796 --> 59:53.797
care to join me?

59:56.926 --> 59:58.510
Okay.

1:00:12.984 --> 1:00:14.318
How was school today?

1:00:16.904 --> 1:00:18.697
School?

1:00:20.491 --> 1:00:22.159
Fine.

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:24.786
That's good.

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:29.958
How was work?

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:33.003
Work? Work was good.

1:00:41.262 --> 1:00:43.430
- Dad?
- Yes, son?

1:00:45.308 --> 1:00:48.769
What is it that you do, exactly?

1:00:50.271 --> 1:00:52.356
That's classified.

1:00:53.608 --> 1:00:54.775
Oh.

1:00:58.571 --> 1:01:01.156
Bobby, would you care
for a piece of pie?

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:04.910
The huckleberries are particularly
delicious today.

1:01:05.119 --> 1:01:07.788
Particularly fresh and delicious.

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:11.083
No, thanks.

1:01:18.424 --> 1:01:20.133
Bobby,

1:01:21.552 --> 1:01:23.261
may I share something with you?

1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.014
Okay.

1:01:26.474 --> 1:01:29.559
A vision I had in my sleep last night.

1:01:30.436 --> 1:01:32.104
As distinguished from a dream,

1:01:32.313 --> 1:01:34.523
which is mere sorting
and cataloging

1:01:34.690 --> 1:01:37.609
of the day's events
by the subconscious.

1:01:39.278 --> 1:01:40.987
This was a vision.

1:01:41.155 --> 1:01:44.408
Fresh and clear
as a mountain stream.

1:01:45.451 --> 1:01:48.453
The mind revealing itself to itself.

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:51.998
In my vision,

1:01:52.166 --> 1:01:55.877
I was on the veranda
of a vast estate,

1:01:56.045 --> 1:01:59.923
a palazzo
of some fantastic proportion.

1:02:00.091 --> 1:02:04.219
There seemed to emanate from it
a light from within this

1:02:04.387 --> 1:02:07.848
gleaming, radiant marble.

1:02:08.015 --> 1:02:13.228
I'd known this place. I had, in fact,
been born and raised there.

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:15.981
This was my first return.

1:02:16.899 --> 1:02:22.863
A reunion with the deepest
wellsprings of my being.

1:02:24.949 --> 1:02:27.367
Wandering about, I noticed happily

1:02:27.535 --> 1:02:31.079
that the house had been
immaculately maintained.

1:02:31.247 --> 1:02:34.583
There had been added a number
of additional rooms,

1:02:35.501 --> 1:02:40.630
but in a way that blended so seamlessly
with the original construction

1:02:40.798 --> 1:02:44.134
one would never detect
any difference.

1:02:44.302 --> 1:02:47.804
Returning to the house's
grand foyer,

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:50.640
there came a knock at the door.

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:54.769
My son was standing there.

1:02:56.355 --> 1:03:00.233
He was happy and carefree.

1:03:01.110 --> 1:03:05.614
Clearly living a life
of deep harmony and joy.

1:03:08.409 --> 1:03:10.243
We embraced.

1:03:10.411 --> 1:03:14.080
A warm and loving embrace,
nothing withheld.

1:03:15.583 --> 1:03:19.377
We were, in this moment, one.

1:03:27.053 --> 1:03:32.849
My vision ended and I awoke
with a tremendous feeling

1:03:33.017 --> 1:03:36.937
of optimism and confidence

1:03:37.104 --> 1:03:38.772
in you and your future.

1:03:40.775 --> 1:03:42.567
That was my vision of you.

1:03:44.111 --> 1:03:45.570
Really?

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:51.618
I'm so glad to have had this opportunity
to share it with you.

1:04:00.211 --> 1:04:05.507
I wish you nothing
but the very best in all things.

1:04:05.925 --> 1:04:07.842
Thank you, Dad.

1:04:08.219 --> 1:04:11.263
- See you later. Call.
- Okay.

1:04:19.522 --> 1:04:21.439
Major?

1:04:21.607 --> 1:04:23.650
How was the pie?

1:04:23.818 --> 1:04:25.360
Exceptional, as always.

1:04:42.086 --> 1:04:44.170
How is Shelly?

1:04:45.298 --> 1:04:47.173
I can't talk right now.

1:04:48.884 --> 1:04:51.219
Well, how did she like the flowers?

1:05:22.918 --> 1:05:26.379
The night Laura Palmer was killed, it
appears she made two appointments.

1:05:26.547 --> 1:05:29.591
In her diary she had written,
"Nervous about meeting J tonight."

1:05:29.759 --> 1:05:31.968
I now believe this was a reference
to James Hurley.

1:05:32.178 --> 1:05:34.054
She was nervous
because she planned to tell him

1:05:34.221 --> 1:05:35.680
she didn't wanna see him anymore.

1:05:35.848 --> 1:05:38.391
Before she snuck out of the house,
she received a phone call.

1:05:38.601 --> 1:05:41.019
We believe it was Leo Johnson
making the second appointment

1:05:41.187 --> 1:05:42.729
for sometime later that night.

1:05:43.356 --> 1:05:45.607
Laura met James,
was with him until 12:30,

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:48.234
when, at the intersection
of Sparkwood and 21,

1:05:48.402 --> 1:05:50.695
she jumped from the bike
and ran into the woods.

1:05:50.863 --> 1:05:53.239
We believe she met up there
with Jacques Renault,

1:05:53.407 --> 1:05:55.700
Leo Johnson and Ronette Pulaski.

1:05:55.868 --> 1:05:58.870
Together, they drove to the foot
of the trail leading to Jacques' cabin.

1:05:59.038 --> 1:06:02.707
They climbed the trail, they were heard
passing by the cabin of the Log Lady.

1:06:02.875 --> 1:06:05.710
They reached Jacques Renault's cabin
at approximately 1 a.m.

1:06:05.878 --> 1:06:08.380
Drugs and alcohol were consumed.
Laura was tied up

1:06:08.547 --> 1:06:11.007
and had sexual relations
with both Leo and Jacques.

1:06:11.175 --> 1:06:13.551
Waldo the bird was let out of his cage
and attacked Laura.

1:06:13.719 --> 1:06:16.554
Leo and Jacques fought.
Jacques went outside and passed out.

1:06:16.722 --> 1:06:19.057
When he came to,
Leo and the girls were gone.

1:06:19.225 --> 1:06:22.477
We believe Leo hiked back down
the trail to his Corvette alone,

1:06:22.645 --> 1:06:24.104
leaving the girls behind.

1:06:24.271 --> 1:06:26.523
The reason being,
there was a third man.

1:06:26.691 --> 1:06:28.608
Deputy Hawk found
evidence of a third man

1:06:28.776 --> 1:06:30.819
outside the window
of Jacques' cabin.

1:06:30.986 --> 1:06:33.196
The third man took Laura
and Ronette to the train

1:06:33.364 --> 1:06:34.364
where they were tied up.

1:06:34.532 --> 1:06:36.449
Laura for the second time,
Ronette for the first.

1:06:36.617 --> 1:06:38.660
Using a blunt object,
the killer hit Ronette

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:40.203
and knocked her unconscious.

1:06:40.371 --> 1:06:42.330
He must have been so intent
on killing Laura,

1:06:42.498 --> 1:06:45.917
he didn't realize that Ronette
regained consciousness and escaped.

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:48.545
Either he didn't know or he didn't care.

1:06:48.713 --> 1:06:50.714
He made a small mound of dirt

1:06:50.881 --> 1:06:53.258
and put the half-heart necklace
of Laura's on top.

1:06:53.426 --> 1:06:57.887
He then placed a small cut out letter R
under the nail of her left ring finger.

1:06:58.055 --> 1:07:02.350
You'll recall that he placed the letter T
under the fingernail of Teresa Banks.

1:07:02.518 --> 1:07:06.479
He left a note written in blood,
"Fire walk with me."

1:07:06.647 --> 1:07:08.148
Here's the interesting thing.

1:07:08.315 --> 1:07:11.067
The blood on the note was tested.
It doesn't match Leo's,

1:07:11.235 --> 1:07:13.445
Jacques', Laura's or Ronette's.

1:07:13.612 --> 1:07:16.698
So we surmise the killer
wrote the note in his own blood.

1:07:16.866 --> 1:07:19.492
It's a rare type, AB negative.

1:07:19.660 --> 1:07:23.288
The towel that Deputy Hawk found
five miles down the tracks

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:25.039
was soaked in blood of that type.

1:07:25.207 --> 1:07:29.043
He also found, near the towel,
scraps of faded paper.

1:07:29.211 --> 1:07:31.379
These scraps may have
been left by the killer.

1:07:31.547 --> 1:07:34.090
They'll be sent back
to Washington, D.C., for testing.

1:07:45.644 --> 1:07:48.688
I know, Andy.
I know, I know, I know.

1:07:48.856 --> 1:07:51.733
It's what we call
a real three-hankie crime.

1:07:58.032 --> 1:08:00.617
Albert Rozerfeld,

1:08:00.785 --> 1:08:05.163
I don't like the way you talk smart
about Sheriff Truman or anybody.

1:08:05.331 --> 1:08:07.123
You just shut your mouth!

1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:27.894
Laura Palmer is dead.

1:08:28.062 --> 1:08:30.271
Jacques Renault is dead.

1:08:30.439 --> 1:08:34.067
Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson
are in comas.

1:08:34.235 --> 1:08:36.444
Waldo the bird is dead.

1:08:37.571 --> 1:08:40.740
This leaves only the third man.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:09:01.344
- You want this door closed?
- Yeah, yeah. We'll frost our rooms.

1:09:02.763 --> 1:09:03.763
Oh.

1:09:03.931 --> 1:09:07.684
- I sure do appreciate the ride, Harry.
- No problem.

1:09:08.477 --> 1:09:10.478
I always appreciate
your company, Pete.

1:09:10.646 --> 1:09:12.480
Oh.

1:09:12.648 --> 1:09:19.153
Boy, this smoke inhalation
is nasty business.

1:09:20.114 --> 1:09:26.786
I feel like somebody taped my lips
to the tailpipe of a bus.

1:09:33.711 --> 1:09:36.254
Take her easy.

1:09:38.507 --> 1:09:44.053
- So where the hell is Josie?
- Oh, well, maybe this will tell us.

1:09:50.436 --> 1:09:51.603
"Dear Pete,

1:09:52.104 --> 1:09:55.315
I had to leave the town

1:09:55.482 --> 1:10:01.321
on an emergency
of business to Seattle.

1:10:02.072 --> 1:10:05.658
I will phone you when I arrive.

1:10:05.826 --> 1:10:09.495
Hope you did a good day
at the mill.

1:10:09.663 --> 1:10:16.169
There is ginger beer in the refrig.
Love, Josie." There you go.

1:10:17.212 --> 1:10:19.005
- Is there a phone number in there?
- No.

1:10:19.173 --> 1:10:22.550
- Does she say where she's staying?
- No, no, she goes off to Seattle

1:10:22.718 --> 1:10:26.596
once every three months or so.

1:10:26.764 --> 1:10:32.602
You want my opinion, I think she goes
over there to indulge a secret vice.

1:10:33.312 --> 1:10:36.064
- What's that?
- Shopping.

1:10:36.231 --> 1:10:38.483
Comes back
with half a department store.

1:10:53.374 --> 1:10:54.916
Pete,

1:10:56.251 --> 1:10:58.544
we haven't found Catherine.

1:11:00.965 --> 1:11:02.590
Yeah.

1:11:03.801 --> 1:11:05.802
I figured.

1:11:05.970 --> 1:11:09.847
I know you wanna hope for the best,

1:11:10.015 --> 1:11:12.308
but you ought to prepare
for the worst.

1:11:13.394 --> 1:11:15.520
Oh, dear.

1:11:19.316 --> 1:11:23.277
I always figured
I'd be the one to go first.

1:11:24.154 --> 1:11:26.155
I mean, if you was laying odds

1:11:26.323 --> 1:11:29.951
on the last person standing
after an atomic war,

1:11:30.119 --> 1:11:31.828
I'd have bet on her.

1:11:34.581 --> 1:11:38.001
Yeah, she was a tiger, all right.

1:11:38.168 --> 1:11:40.962
Ah, no use mincing words.

1:11:41.130 --> 1:11:45.299
She was plain hell to live with.

1:11:46.635 --> 1:11:48.845
Plain hell.

1:11:51.682 --> 1:11:53.349
But

1:11:54.476 --> 1:11:58.563
once, there was a little bit
of heaven there too.

1:11:59.189 --> 1:12:01.357
Oh, I'm sure there was.

1:12:02.067 --> 1:12:03.609
Oh, God.

1:12:04.987 --> 1:12:07.864
This will take a little while
to sink in, I suppose.

1:12:08.866 --> 1:12:10.491
I suppose it will.

1:12:15.039 --> 1:12:17.957
God help her miserable soul.

1:12:18.834 --> 1:12:20.918
I loved her.

1:12:34.141 --> 1:12:35.308
Blue Pine Lodge.

1:12:35.517 --> 1:12:37.602
Could I speak to Josie Packard,
please?

1:12:37.770 --> 1:12:41.272
- Well, she's not here right now.
- Can you tell me when she'll be back?

1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:43.608
Well, she's out of town.
Who's calling?

1:12:53.077 --> 1:12:55.953
I'd like to place
an international call, please.

1:12:56.622 --> 1:12:58.915
Collect to Hong Kong.

1:13:01.627 --> 1:13:03.336
Doesn't that sound?

1:13:03.504 --> 1:13:06.130
I mean, I ate it,
but I didn't really know what it was.

1:13:06.298 --> 1:13:08.174
I read about it
in this French magazine,

1:13:08.342 --> 1:13:13.679
and they take the entire head and dip it
in a kind of blancmange pudding.

1:13:13.847 --> 1:13:18.768
And then they roll it in oats and stuff it
full of walnuts and hot rocks

1:13:18.936 --> 1:13:20.978
- and a spice cookie.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

1:13:21.146 --> 1:13:23.523
- They wrap it in papillon.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

1:13:23.690 --> 1:13:24.899
They seal the edges

1:13:25.067 --> 1:13:27.944
- with a sugar glaze...
- Mm.

1:13:28.112 --> 1:13:30.279
- ...and bake it under glass.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

1:13:30.447 --> 1:13:31.989
Ah. That sounds incredible.

1:13:32.157 --> 1:13:35.576
It is to die for.

1:13:37.204 --> 1:13:39.372
Have you seen Audrey today?

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:41.499
No, I haven't.

1:13:52.928 --> 1:13:54.345
Hank Jennings.

1:13:54.513 --> 1:13:57.348
Jerry and Benjamin Horne.

1:14:05.566 --> 1:14:07.483
Where's Josie?

1:14:07.651 --> 1:14:09.777
She left last night.

1:14:12.239 --> 1:14:14.115
Prearranged?

1:14:14.283 --> 1:14:18.536
She wanted to put a little distance
between her and the smell of smoke.

1:14:19.454 --> 1:14:21.747
Sound strategy.

1:14:22.708 --> 1:14:25.668
Next business, Leo Johnson.

1:14:25.836 --> 1:14:27.879
He's in a coma.

1:14:28.046 --> 1:14:29.797
Looks like brain damage.

1:14:29.965 --> 1:14:33.176
With Leo, how could they tell?

1:14:35.095 --> 1:14:37.054
Why isn't he dead?

1:14:37.222 --> 1:14:41.184
I caught him center shot with a.44.

1:14:41.351 --> 1:14:43.311
Couldn't risk going inside.

1:14:43.478 --> 1:14:47.231
Neighborhood was hot.
I had to sneak past patrols as it was.

1:14:47.399 --> 1:14:49.025
Anybody see you?

1:14:49.193 --> 1:14:51.194
Negative.

1:14:51.361 --> 1:14:53.905
He was chopping wood.

1:14:54.072 --> 1:14:56.699
Chopping wood? Inside?

1:14:56.867 --> 1:14:58.784
- Yeah, you know Leo.
- Wait a minute.

1:14:58.952 --> 1:15:02.205
- Chopping wood inside?
- Yeah.

1:15:02.414 --> 1:15:04.165
You know Leo.

1:15:06.585 --> 1:15:09.378
All right. What's next?

1:15:09.796 --> 1:15:11.631
Catherine.

1:15:13.592 --> 1:15:15.259
Dead?

1:15:15.427 --> 1:15:19.222
My phone call put her in the drying
shed when the place went up.

1:15:19.389 --> 1:15:22.141
Sounds like buried
with the wreckage.

1:15:22.351 --> 1:15:26.812
Heat like that,
they'll be lucky to find teeth.

1:15:27.773 --> 1:15:30.566
And they were such pretty teeth.

1:15:31.401 --> 1:15:35.238
Marvelous.

1:15:35.405 --> 1:15:37.698
Gentlemen,

1:15:37.908 --> 1:15:42.078
if they don't hang the arson
on the late lamented Catherine

1:15:42.246 --> 1:15:45.665
and her coconspirator Leo,

1:15:45.832 --> 1:15:47.750
I'll give up sex.

1:15:49.962 --> 1:15:52.546
That's confidence.

1:15:54.758 --> 1:15:56.842
What do we do with the ledger?

1:15:57.010 --> 1:15:58.135
Hank,

1:15:59.471 --> 1:16:03.099
you leave the creative thinking
to the brothers Horne.

1:16:03.267 --> 1:16:06.936
You're a bicep.
Relax until we say, "Flex."

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:14.402
Now, that really makes me mad.

1:16:21.868 --> 1:16:25.454
You guys. Ha-ha-ha.

1:16:32.504 --> 1:16:34.130
Come in.

1:16:56.069 --> 1:16:58.612
Why is the door to my room locked?

1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:01.699
And who's the refrigerator?

1:17:04.661 --> 1:17:09.665
The owner was a little disappointed
in your performance last night.

1:17:13.670 --> 1:17:17.590
Well, the owner isn't exactly my type.

1:17:35.942 --> 1:17:38.611
And what is your type exactly?

1:17:41.782 --> 1:17:45.659
Not you. No offense.

1:17:52.042 --> 1:17:53.292
Hey.

1:17:55.545 --> 1:17:58.339
Let's get one thing straight
between us, princess.

1:17:59.591 --> 1:18:01.592
Okay.

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.804
I don't wanna hear another complaint
about you.

1:18:04.971 --> 1:18:06.472
When you work for me,

1:18:06.973 --> 1:18:09.225
everybody's your type.

1:18:25.450 --> 1:18:27.243
Norma?

1:18:28.036 --> 1:18:30.329
Hi, it's Donna.

1:18:31.748 --> 1:18:34.583
I'm calling about Meals on Wheels.

1:18:35.502 --> 1:18:39.088
I'm gonna take over Laura's route
if that's okay with you.

1:18:41.007 --> 1:18:42.716
Okay.

1:18:43.510 --> 1:18:45.177
Great.

1:18:46.138 --> 1:18:49.557
Listen, can I use the Double R
station wagon?

1:18:51.435 --> 1:18:53.102
All right.

1:18:54.938 --> 1:18:56.439
Great.

1:18:57.482 --> 1:18:59.692
Then I'll see you tomorrow at 9.

1:19:11.913 --> 1:19:14.707
Gersten's gonna tell us
about tonight's proceedings.

1:19:14.875 --> 1:19:18.919
She has some very good news.
We're all very proud of her.

1:19:19.087 --> 1:19:20.129
Good evening.

1:19:20.297 --> 1:19:22.965
I'm Gersten Hayward
and I'd like to welcome you all

1:19:23.133 --> 1:19:24.800
to the Hayward Supper Club.

1:19:27.304 --> 1:19:29.305
I'm going to be playing
various selections

1:19:29.473 --> 1:19:30.639
of music for you this evening.

1:19:31.558 --> 1:19:33.100
My good news is that I was chosen

1:19:33.268 --> 1:19:35.853
to be the fairy princess
in my school play.

1:19:36.021 --> 1:19:38.355
This is my special dress.

1:19:38.523 --> 1:19:41.817
Also, I got the highest scores
in mathematics and English

1:19:41.985 --> 1:19:43.194
this midseason term,

1:19:43.361 --> 1:19:45.821
just as my sisters, Harriet and Donna,
did before me.

1:19:45.989 --> 1:19:49.325
So now I don't have to worry
about being ashamed anymore.

1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:53.704
Before I play,
Harriet would like to read a poem

1:19:53.872 --> 1:19:57.208
about your daughter
and our friend Laura.

1:20:17.687 --> 1:20:19.522
Um...

1:20:19.689 --> 1:20:21.774
It was Laura

1:20:22.484 --> 1:20:25.611
And I saw her glowing

1:20:26.154 --> 1:20:28.364
In the dark woods

1:20:28.532 --> 1:20:31.700
I saw her smiling

1:20:32.661 --> 1:20:36.497
We were crying and I saw her

1:20:37.457 --> 1:20:39.500
Laughing

1:20:40.043 --> 1:20:44.547
In our sadness
I saw her dancing

1:20:44.714 --> 1:20:48.551
It was Laura living in my dreams

1:20:50.470 --> 1:20:52.179
It was Laura

1:20:53.431 --> 1:20:55.766
The glow was life

1:20:55.934 --> 1:20:58.561
Her smile was to say

1:20:58.728 --> 1:21:00.479
It was all right to cry

1:21:02.691 --> 1:21:05.359
The woods was our sadness

1:21:06.361 --> 1:21:09.989
The dance was her calling

1:21:10.824 --> 1:21:12.866
It was Laura

1:21:13.868 --> 1:21:16.912
And she came to kiss me goodbye

1:21:30.093 --> 1:21:33.053
That was wonderful. Thank you.

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:44.940
Gersten.

1:21:45.108 --> 1:21:50.154
Now I'm going to play Mendelssohn's
"Rondo Capriccioso, Opus 14."

1:22:36.868 --> 1:22:39.036
I got the list and map
for Meals on Wheels.

1:22:39.204 --> 1:22:40.996
I'm going to start tomorrow.

1:22:41.164 --> 1:22:42.998
Aces.

1:22:47.504 --> 1:22:48.545
Long day, Will?

1:22:52.342 --> 1:22:56.220
I feel like I've sat through
back-to-back operas.

1:22:56.846 --> 1:23:00.224
In med school, we learned to live
on three hours a night and catnaps.

1:23:00.392 --> 1:23:02.476
It's terrible about the mill.

1:23:02.644 --> 1:23:05.938
Yeah. They say more
than 150 jobs may be lost.

1:23:06.106 --> 1:23:08.524
Awful. Just awful.

1:23:08.692 --> 1:23:11.443
I suppose this will open the door

1:23:11.611 --> 1:23:16.573
for Ben Horne
and his big development plans.

1:23:16.741 --> 1:23:19.243
Well, as his lawyer, and yours,

1:23:19.411 --> 1:23:22.287
- of course I can't comment.
- Hmm.

1:23:22.455 --> 1:23:25.749
Well, as your doctor, Leland,

1:23:25.917 --> 1:23:27.668
what the hell happened to your hair?

1:23:30.255 --> 1:23:32.631
It is strange, isn't it?

1:23:32.799 --> 1:23:33.924
Well, I just, uh...

1:23:34.092 --> 1:23:37.052
I woke up this morning,
looked in the mirror, and there it was.

1:23:37.220 --> 1:23:39.513
It had literally changed overnight.

1:23:39.681 --> 1:23:42.141
Well, considering
all you've been through...

1:23:42.308 --> 1:23:44.309
You know,
the funny thing about it is,

1:23:44.477 --> 1:23:47.479
seeing it, I realized that I had

1:23:47.647 --> 1:23:50.107
turned a corner somehow.

1:23:50.275 --> 1:23:53.360
I feel a great deal
of sadness still, yes,

1:23:53.528 --> 1:23:56.488
but it wasn't as overwhelming to me.

1:23:56.656 --> 1:24:00.993
I physically felt as if a great weight
had been lifted from my heart.

1:24:01.828 --> 1:24:03.996
- Perhaps it has.
- Perhaps it has.

1:24:04.205 --> 1:24:05.914
Perhaps it has.

1:24:06.082 --> 1:24:07.458
God, I feel like singing.

1:24:09.252 --> 1:24:10.753
That would be very nice.

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:13.797
No, I really feel like singing a song.

1:24:17.010 --> 1:24:20.721
- Leland?
- Come on, everybody. Get happy.

1:24:20.889 --> 1:24:22.014
- "Get Happy."
- "Get Happy"?

1:24:22.182 --> 1:24:23.432
Mm-hm.

1:24:27.479 --> 1:24:30.314
Forget your troubles
And just get happy

1:24:30.482 --> 1:24:32.649
You gotta pack all your cares away

1:24:32.817 --> 1:24:35.068
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1:24:35.403 --> 1:24:37.696
Get ready for the judgment day

1:24:37.864 --> 1:24:40.157
The sun is shinin'
Come on, get happy

1:24:40.325 --> 1:24:42.451
The Lord is waitin' to take your hand

1:24:42.619 --> 1:24:45.245
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1:24:45.413 --> 1:24:47.247
We're going to that promised land

1:24:47.415 --> 1:24:52.127
We're headin' 'cross the river
Wash your sins away in the tide

1:24:52.295 --> 1:24:56.882
It's, oh, so peaceful on the other side

1:24:57.050 --> 1:24:59.134
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy

1:24:59.302 --> 1:25:01.637
You better chase all your cares away

1:25:01.805 --> 1:25:03.722
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1:25:03.890 --> 1:25:05.474
Get ready for the judgment day

1:25:05.642 --> 1:25:08.977
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1:25:09.145 --> 1:25:10.687
Get ready for the judgment day

1:25:10.855 --> 1:25:12.481
Sing hallelujah
Come on, get happy

1:25:12.649 --> 1:25:15.025
Get ready for the judgment d...

1:25:20.198 --> 1:25:22.241
Donna, get my bag.

1:25:24.953 --> 1:25:26.745
Leland?

1:25:28.498 --> 1:25:32.334
- Dad, is he okay?
- I'm sure it's nothing serious.

1:25:35.797 --> 1:25:39.174
Oh. Oh, God.

1:25:39.509 --> 1:25:43.178
I feel happy.

1:25:43.346 --> 1:25:45.389
"Begin the Beguine."

1:25:50.645 --> 1:25:55.190
Diane, it's 11:55 p.m.,

1:25:55.358 --> 1:25:57.901
approximately 19 hours
since the shooting incident

1:25:58.069 --> 1:26:00.362
which nearly caused me
to make a premature purchase

1:26:00.530 --> 1:26:01.989
of the proverbial farm.

1:26:02.949 --> 1:26:04.950
I'm dog-tired.

1:26:05.118 --> 1:26:09.454
A man can only go so long
without submitting to a period of rest.

1:26:09.622 --> 1:26:11.206
For as we know from experiments

1:26:11.374 --> 1:26:14.418
conducted on American GIs
during the Korean War,

1:26:14.586 --> 1:26:19.089
sleep deprivation is a one-way ticket
to temporary psychosis.

1:26:19.257 --> 1:26:22.134
And I'm working on a three-day jag.

1:26:23.094 --> 1:26:24.803
I got so goofy last night, Diane,

1:26:24.971 --> 1:26:28.098
lying here wondering
whether I was going to live or die,

1:26:28.266 --> 1:26:32.311
that I thought I saw a giant
in my room.

1:26:32.478 --> 1:26:35.898
Or perhaps that's a story
I'll save for another time.

1:26:36.774 --> 1:26:38.775
This is me, Dale,

1:26:38.943 --> 1:26:43.113
Room 315 at The Great Northern Hotel,
signing off.

1:27:07.263 --> 1:27:09.598
Special agent.

1:27:10.767 --> 1:27:14.311
Special agent. Special agent.

1:27:18.024 --> 1:27:20.609
Special agent, are you there?

1:27:24.864 --> 1:27:27.157
I left you a note.
Didn't you get my note?

1:27:28.743 --> 1:27:31.912
I slipped it under your door.
You must have seen it.

1:27:41.255 --> 1:27:43.340
Well, I'm up here
at One-Eyed Jack's.

1:27:44.467 --> 1:27:48.303
To be perfectly honest,
I think I'm in a little over my head.

1:27:52.058 --> 1:27:54.518
Not that I can't handle it.

1:27:55.353 --> 1:27:58.271
I mean, if I'm gonna help you out
with your investigations,

1:27:58.439 --> 1:28:01.358
I'm sure I'll be put into situations
a lot more dangerous than this

1:28:01.526 --> 1:28:03.944
on a fairly regular basis.

1:28:05.822 --> 1:28:07.781
But it's just,

1:28:09.784 --> 1:28:12.411
you know, my first time out.

1:28:12.578 --> 1:28:15.664
I could use a little expert guidance.

1:28:20.044 --> 1:28:21.670
So you know,
there is a connection

1:28:21.838 --> 1:28:24.339
between Horne's Department Store
and One-Eyed Jack's.

1:28:24.507 --> 1:28:27.551
It's my father. He owns the place.

1:28:27.719 --> 1:28:30.679
Little ball of sleaze named Battis
helps to recruit some of the girls

1:28:30.847 --> 1:28:33.640
from the perfume counter.

1:28:33.808 --> 1:28:37.728
Tomorrow I'm gonna try to find out
if Laura and Ronette came up here.

1:28:44.444 --> 1:28:48.280
I hope you won't think any less of me
for trying to help you.

1:28:49.365 --> 1:28:53.577
You know, I promise I only did it
with the best of intentions.

1:28:54.662 --> 1:28:57.080
And if there's any way...

1:28:58.499 --> 1:29:02.544
If there's any way in the world
that you can hear me right now,

1:29:02.712 --> 1:29:05.505
please help me.

1:29:07.425 --> 1:29:09.176
Help me. Help me.

1:29:54.597 --> 1:29:56.306
Sorry to wake you.

1:29:59.477 --> 1:30:01.520
I am not dreaming.

1:30:02.105 --> 1:30:04.439
I forgot to tell you something.

1:30:06.275 --> 1:30:08.819
You were right
about the smiling bag.

1:30:09.821 --> 1:30:13.698
The things I tell you
will not be wrong.

1:30:16.577 --> 1:30:19.621
Better to listen than to talk.

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:22.666
I believe you.

1:30:22.834 --> 1:30:26.128
Don't search
for all the answers at once.

1:30:27.004 --> 1:30:32.342
A path is formed
by laying one stone at a time.

1:30:36.097 --> 1:30:40.767
One person saw the third man.

1:30:40.935 --> 1:30:45.063
Three have seen him, yes,

1:30:45.231 --> 1:30:47.149
but not his body.

1:30:47.316 --> 1:30:51.486
One only known to you.

1:30:51.654 --> 1:30:53.738
Ready now to talk.

1:30:56.909 --> 1:30:59.536
One more thing.

1:30:59.704 --> 1:31:02.372
You forgot something.

1:31:04.375 --> 1:31:05.959
What?

1:32:11.442 --> 1:32:13.526
Laura! Laura!

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:31.503
Laura!
