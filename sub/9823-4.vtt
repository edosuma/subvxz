11:30.792 --> 11:32.692
he's got a sawed-off and...

11:32.727 --> 11:35.361
Right in Dawg's face.

11:35.397 --> 11:37.463
I was behind him.

11:38.833 --> 11:40.533
Sickest thing I ever saw, to this day.

11:40.568 --> 11:41.801
And this?

11:41.836 --> 11:43.770
A piece of dawg's skull...

11:43.805 --> 11:46.339
under the skin, a little piece of him.

11:46.374 --> 11:48.541
I tried digging it out,
but it's in there pretty good.

11:48.576 --> 11:50.810
Anyway, not the kinda thing
you go to the doctor's for.

11:50.845 --> 11:55.948
The thing about it was,
Tuco really liked Dawg.

11:55.984 --> 11:57.850
Kind of felt bad afterwards.

11:57.886 --> 12:00.687
But when he's using,
[Pops lips] Loco, crazy.

12:00.722 --> 12:02.789
There's no other way to put it.

12:02.824 --> 12:04.490
And he's using again, Crystal.

12:04.526 --> 12:06.959
Much bigger kick.

12:06.995 --> 12:09.128
So... it's like you said.

12:09.164 --> 12:13.499
If Tuco finds out about my,
y'know, independent ventures,

12:13.535 --> 12:16.336
it's gonna be Dawg all over again.

12:16.371 --> 12:19.339
It's him or me.

what had happened.

12:44.299 --> 12:46.933
No witnesses. Clean egress.

12:46.968 --> 12:48.868
Pretty far.

12:50.306 --> 12:53.742
You can make that shot?

12:53.776 --> 12:56.310
Yeah. [Sighs]

12:57.413 --> 13:00.447
You saying you'll do it?

13:02.051 --> 13:04.418
50 grand?

13:04.453 --> 13:06.920
50 grand.

Your brother isn't here, Mr. McGill.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.432
I know.

13:40.468 --> 13:42.000
Uh, he sent me to get his ink blotter.

13:42.036 --> 13:44.403
- I'll just be a second.
- Watch yourself.

13:44.438 --> 13:46.004
The floor's slick.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.273
Oh, thank you, Gesualdo.

Sorry about the floor!

13:56.617 --> 13:59.685
Oh, no.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.420
Are you looking for Ms. Wexler?

14:01.455 --> 14:03.388
[Sighs] I guess I'm too late, huh?

14:03.424 --> 14:04.723
No, she's still here.

14:04.758 --> 14:06.792

14:26.514 --> 14:29.948
I am so, [Chuckling] So sorry.

14:29.984 --> 14:33.752
I should have told you last night.

14:33.787 --> 14:35.787
You think?

14:35.823 --> 14:37.990
I honestly thought I could fix it.

14:38.025 --> 14:41.293
I thought they'd understand
once they saw the numbers.

14:41.328 --> 14:43.462
I knew it would work, and it did.

14:43.497 --> 14:45.831
It worked. [Sighs]

14:45.866 --> 14:49.902
Howard can't just stick you in doc review

14:49.937 --> 14:51.270
because of something I did.

14:51.305 --> 14:53.071
Plus, at an ‭entirely different law firm.

14:53.107 --> 14:55.240
What the hell kind of sense does that make?!

14:55.276 --> 14:57.242
I told you this would happen.

14:57.278 --> 14:59.144
He can't blame you for this.

14:59.179 --> 15:00.812
I warned you he would.

15:02.383 --> 15:03.849
I'm talking to Howard.

15:03.884 --> 15:05.183
What?

15:05.219 --> 15:06.518
And call him a pig fucker again?

15:06.554 --> 15:07.886
Yeah, that'll help.

15:09.490 --> 15:12.858
I screwed up, you know? [Chuckling]

15:12.893 --> 15:14.192
I know that.

19:32.586 --> 19:36.755
state of the art,
‭accurate to 2,400 meters.

19:36.790 --> 19:39.057
I got the Leupold Mark 4 on it now,

19:39.092 --> 19:42.194

to a Schmidt & Bender.

Single shot, bolt.

19:44.498 --> 19:47.065
Simple, effective, reliable.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.801
It fires the .50-caliber BMG...

19:49.837 --> 19:53.071
very effective against
soft targets in light cover...

19:53.106 --> 19:55.807
behind cars, ‭small-diameter
trees, and such.

19:55.843 --> 19:58.109
As always, I've gone to the trouble

19:58.145 --> 20:00.412
of grinding down the serial number.

20:00.447 --> 20:03.148
Well, unless you
‭ground a hole clean through,

20:03.183 --> 20:04.482
acid will recover it.

20:04.518 --> 20:06.218
Well, that would be true,

20:06.253 --> 20:07.752
but I follow up with a pass

20:14.695 --> 20:16.795

20:26.206 --> 20:30.909
not including your bipod,
which adds some heft.

20:30.944 --> 20:33.411
Too much gun.

Not quite the range
or the punch of the AR-50,

20:46.793 --> 20:49.494
but you're still talking about a .5 M.O.A.

20:49.529 --> 20:51.630
At well past 1,000 meters.

20:51.665 --> 20:53.265
I've heard they're prone to jam.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.433
Well, it's been known
to happen in the field,

20:55.469 --> 20:59.004
but there's not a semi-auto
built can boast it never jams.

20:59.039 --> 21:02.173
If that's a concern,
you ought to stick to bolts.

21:02.209 --> 21:05.010
Good bolt-action rifle... if you jammed it,

21:05.045 --> 21:07.679

Essentially, the same rifle used
by marine snipers since 1966.

21:20.527 --> 21:24.062
It's light, accurate, good for soft targets

21:24.097 --> 21:26.498

That's the a1 model.

21:38.745 --> 21:41.746
There's not much change from the original.

21:41.782 --> 21:44.349
Biggest difference is the stock...

21:44.384 --> 21:46.818
it's fiberglass instead of wood.

21:46.853 --> 21:49.321
It changed it over in 1970 or so.

21:49.356 --> 21:53.325
Good. Wood warped like hell.

25:15.979 --> 25:17.646
the world revolves around you, Jimmy,

25:17.715 --> 25:20.115
but this has nothing to do with you.

25:20.151 --> 25:23.285
Kim had a responsibility
to Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.821
She should have been looking out
for her firm's interests.

25:25.856 --> 25:28.290
Not letting us know what
you were up to was her mistake.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.725
Oh, come on.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.727
You can't be pissed off at her about this.

25:31.762 --> 25:32.995
I'm not.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.229
[Chuckling] Howard is.

25:34.265 --> 25:35.497
And why shouldn't he be?

25:35.533 --> 25:37.566
Because she didn't know.

25:37.602 --> 25:41.136
She didn't know ‭I was
gonna air the commercial.

25:41.172 --> 25:43.305
She didn't know
‭I hadn't gotten it approved.

25:43.341 --> 25:44.840
She just... she didn't know.

25:45.999 --> 25:47.199
[Sighs]

25:47.234 --> 25:48.467
[Newspaper thuds]

25:48.502 --> 25:49.701
I see.

25:49.737 --> 25:50.769
So, she didn't know

25:50.832 --> 25:53.966
there was anything that
she was supposed to tell Howard.

25:54.002 --> 25:55.801
As far as she was concerned,

25:55.837 --> 25:57.870
Cliff Main was already looped in.

25:57.906 --> 26:00.473
You told her he was?

26:00.508 --> 26:01.874
I implied it.

26:01.910 --> 26:03.776
So it's on me, not her.

26:03.811 --> 26:05.044
[Sighs]

26:05.079 --> 26:06.913
[Engine starts in distance]

26:09.117 --> 26:11.584
She didn't say anything to us about that.

26:11.619 --> 26:13.085
Well, she wouldn't.

26:13.121 --> 26:15.955
Sh-she wouldn't want to make me look bad.

26:15.990 --> 26:19.659
You have to admit this shows
a lack of judgment on her part.

26:19.694 --> 26:20.927
She knows you.

26:20.929 --> 26:21.962
She should have known better.

26:22.044 --> 26:23.477
You are such an asshole.

26:23.512 --> 26:25.145
Why?

26:25.181 --> 26:27.414
For pointing out that her one
mistake was believing in you?

26:27.450 --> 26:29.984
For Christ's sake, can we get
some perspective here?

26:30.019 --> 26:31.819
It was a simple, little commercial.

26:31.854 --> 26:33.354
It aired once... that's all.

26:33.389 --> 26:35.155
And can I remind you... it worked.

26:35.191 --> 26:36.490
It worked like a dream.

26:36.525 --> 26:38.258
See, that's your problem, Jimmy...

26:38.294 --> 26:40.160
thinking the ends justify the means.

26:40.196 --> 26:43.063
And you're forever shocked when
it all blows up in your face.

26:43.099 --> 26:44.331
[Scoffs]

26:44.367 --> 26:45.866
What did I do that was so wrong?

26:45.901 --> 26:47.701
[Sighs] You broke the rules.

26:48.897 --> 26:51.431
‭You turned Kim into your accessory.

26:51.462 --> 26:54.029
You embarrassed Howard, who...
God help him...

26:54.065 --> 26:56.565
inexplicably vouched for
you with Cliff Main!

26:56.601 --> 26:58.734
You made Cliff and his
partners look like schmucks!

26:58.769 --> 27:00.302
Shall I go on?!

27:00.338 --> 27:05.274
How he hasn't fired you for this
positively mystifies me.

27:05.309 --> 27:06.709
"Perspective."

27:06.744 --> 27:08.644
You want perspective?

27:08.679 --> 27:10.279
I'll give you mine...

27:10.314 --> 27:12.915
You're my brother and I love you,

27:12.950 --> 27:15.017
but you're like an alcoholic

27:15.029 --> 27:16.495
who refuses to admit he's got a problem.

27:16.530 --> 27:19.498
Now someone's given you
the keys to the school bus,

27:19.533 --> 27:22.334
and I'm not gonna let you
drive it off a cliff!

27:22.369 --> 27:24.736
Now, can we just get down
to brass tacks here?

27:24.772 --> 27:27.506
What can I do to put Kim
back where she belongs, huh?

27:27.541 --> 27:29.741
What... you want me to quit Davis & Main?

27:29.777 --> 27:31.276
That's fine.

27:31.312 --> 27:32.878
I... I never wanted that job
in the first place.

27:32.913 --> 27:34.446
I can't get through to you.

27:34.481 --> 27:37.015
Life is not one big game
of "let's make a deal"!

27:37.051 --> 27:39.117
Yes, it is! ‭[Chuckles] I'm Monty Hall!

27:39.153 --> 27:40.852
What's behind door number two?

27:40.888 --> 27:42.220
What'll it take, huh?!

27:42.256 --> 27:44.122
You want me to quit being a lawyer?

Ju... a chimp with a machine gun...

27:47.928 --> 27:49.761
That's me, right, huh?!

27:49.797 --> 27:51.463
So, what do you say?

27:51.498 --> 27:53.799
You help Kim, I quit the law.

27:53.834 --> 27:56.301
- Is that a deal?
- ‭I didn't say that.

27:56.337 --> 27:58.737
No, you didn't say it, but
that's what you want, right?!

27:58.772 --> 28:01.239
That's why you put the screws
to Kim in the first place...

28:01.275 --> 28:02.774
to squeeze me!

28:02.810 --> 28:04.109
I didn't say that,
‭and I would never say that!

28:04.144 --> 28:05.944
Why not?!

28:05.979 --> 28:09.147
Because if I were impeding the
career of one of my employees

28:09.183 --> 28:11.083
for the purpose of compelling you

28:11.118 --> 28:14.252
to do something against your
will, that would be extortion.

28:14.288 --> 28:15.954
Yeah. ‭It would. [Chuckles]

28:15.989 --> 28:17.322
So?

28:17.358 --> 28:19.591
You gonna extort me, Chuck?

28:19.626 --> 28:21.760
It's a lead-pipe cinch
you'd get away with it.

28:21.795 --> 28:23.261
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

28:23.297 --> 28:25.464
It's real easy... you just
set things right for Kim.

28:25.499 --> 28:27.666
You get her back in her office,
out of doc review...

28:27.701 --> 28:32.070
everything back to normal,
and I quit the law for good.

28:32.106 --> 28:34.673
No more Jimmy McGill, esquire... poof!

28:34.708 --> 28:36.675

28:53.139 --> 28:55.172
You want me to commit a felony...

28:55.207 --> 28:57.374
Because that's what you'd do, right?

28:57.410 --> 29:00.911

deep down, I'm some hypocrite!
