_

01:50.970 --> 01:53.246
A.B.C.

01:55.329 --> 01:57.373
Avoid. Barricade.

01:57.375 --> 01:59.026
Confront.

01:59.029 --> 02:01.812
If there is an active shooter situation,

02:01.814 --> 02:05.739
your first line of defense
is "A," avoid the gunman.

02:07.593 --> 02:09.656
Hey. Where do you guys want this?

02:09.658 --> 02:11.778
- What is that?
- Alcohol.

02:11.780 --> 02:14.259
Office at the end of
the hall on the right.

02:14.261 --> 02:16.348
- Thanks.
- You hear a gunshot.

02:16.350 --> 02:19.003
You look out into the hall.
You see a man with a gun.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.963
Could be the shooter.
Could be building security.

02:21.965 --> 02:23.747
You may think you know what's going on,

02:23.749 --> 02:25.618
but you don't. Not yet.

02:25.620 --> 02:28.473
- That's why you avoid.
- Wait...

02:31.496 --> 02:34.714
Uh... uh, we-we
couldn't hear that, Liz.

02:34.716 --> 02:37.284
- Where are you?
- I'm in the car.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.409
I had to take my son to
a doctor's appointment.

02:39.412 --> 02:41.562
Because I have ADHD!

02:41.565 --> 02:44.834
Yes. And there is
nothing wrong with that.

02:44.837 --> 02:46.638
Uh, Liz, why don't you, uh...

02:46.641 --> 02:49.642
I'm s... I-I couldn't hear that.

02:49.644 --> 02:53.124
Okay. All right, we-we've
got bad reception.

02:53.126 --> 02:54.534
I'll be in in a minute.

02:54.537 --> 02:56.693
Mr. Coulson.

02:56.695 --> 02:58.641
- Adios, amigos.
- What's going on?

02:58.644 --> 03:00.688
I just came to say
good-bye to the kids.

03:00.691 --> 03:02.140
Good-bye? Why?

03:02.143 --> 03:03.961
Didn't you get my note?

03:03.963 --> 03:05.571
I was let go.

03:05.573 --> 03:07.138
When? What happened?

03:07.140 --> 03:08.430
Last Friday.

03:08.460 --> 03:12.491
It was an administrative
decision. That's all I know.

03:12.493 --> 03:16.147
- Well, that's awful.
- But I'm glad I got to see you.

03:16.149 --> 03:18.198
You be good for Ms. Weiss, okay, man?

03:18.201 --> 03:20.064
Ms. Weiss from the library?

03:20.066 --> 03:21.413
Mr. Coulson,

03:21.415 --> 03:23.024
we need you to leave the premises.

03:23.026 --> 03:25.174
Okay. Take care, Malcolm.

03:28.846 --> 03:32.033
Yes, I-I just want you to know

03:32.035 --> 03:35.253
that-that he's one of
Malcolm's favorite teachers.

03:35.255 --> 03:38.256
And Malcolm isn't always
the easiest kid to handle.

03:38.258 --> 03:39.354
Unfortunately,

03:39.357 --> 03:40.780
it's against school policy

03:40.782 --> 03:42.652
to comment on personnel matters.

03:42.654 --> 03:44.349
And this will probably be adjudicated.

03:44.351 --> 03:45.785
If you change your mind,

03:45.787 --> 03:47.874
- here's our card.
- It's not about changing my mind.

03:47.876 --> 03:48.963
What, he's appealing?

03:48.965 --> 03:51.748
Yes, it's the right of every
tenured teacher.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.489
His arbitration is this afternoon.

03:53.491 --> 03:54.874
What I find unfortunate,

03:54.877 --> 03:56.753
Ms. DuPont, is that Mr. Coulson

03:56.755 --> 03:59.277
is one of your few teachers
of color at the school.

03:59.279 --> 04:02.280
That has nothing to do
with any of this, ma'am.

04:02.282 --> 04:04.195
Our push for diversity is renowned.

04:04.197 --> 04:05.788
Yes, I've heard of your push

04:05.791 --> 04:08.069
quite a bit at all
the school assemblies.

04:08.071 --> 04:09.635
I have a feeling that, uh,

04:09.637 --> 04:12.203
we'll be in touch.

04:12.205 --> 04:13.813
How long do you think it will take you?

04:13.815 --> 04:16.728
I wouldn't go anywhere.

04:16.731 --> 04:18.838
Jay, you have a minute?

04:18.841 --> 04:21.101
- Uh... sure.
- Listen, I need some information

04:21.103 --> 04:22.705
about an arbitration that's happening.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.736
Actually, can it wait
till this afternoon?

04:24.739 --> 04:26.478
- Lucca just grabbed me.
- No, no, no, no. The arbitration

04:26.480 --> 04:29.177
- is this afternoon, so I...
- I can do it.

04:29.179 --> 04:31.222
Uh, no, I...

04:31.224 --> 04:32.838
Uh, n-no, that's okay.

04:32.841 --> 04:35.921
No, seriously, Mrs. Reddick,
I'm licensed now. I can do it.

04:35.924 --> 04:38.316
Okay. All right.

04:38.318 --> 04:41.052
I-I need to know why
a teacher was fired.

04:41.055 --> 04:42.054
Liz.

04:42.057 --> 04:44.322
You got a minute?

04:44.324 --> 04:48.326
So, we had 140 RSVPs,

04:48.328 --> 04:52.015
but today we're getting
a lot of calls reversing them.

04:50.983 --> 04:52.896
What, people don't want to see

04:52.020 --> 04:54.202
our swanky new office?

04:54.204 --> 04:55.638
The lawyer killings.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.057
Our chemical scare.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.641
So, the worry is that we'll
have a poorly attended party?

04:59.644 --> 05:01.963
No, the worry is we'll be embarrassed.

05:01.966 --> 05:03.124
I say, fuck it.

05:03.126 --> 05:05.300
You've been saying that a lot lately.

05:05.302 --> 05:06.825
Making up for lost time.

05:10.283 --> 05:11.828
Okay.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.861
I say we invite all

05:13.864 --> 05:15.745
the associates and all the paralegals.

05:15.747 --> 05:18.400
We just need some warm
bodies filling up the rooms.

05:18.402 --> 05:19.662
Okay?

05:19.664 --> 05:21.577
- Sure.
- Yeah.

05:21.579 --> 05:23.927
Fuck it.

05:28.325 --> 05:29.846
What's going on with you two?

05:31.487 --> 05:32.488
Sorry.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.780
Hey, Kurt. What's going on?

05:37.783 --> 05:40.291
Three months in, and we're
still in the preliminary hearing.

05:40.293 --> 05:41.775
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:41.778 --> 05:43.361
Hotel living can be so awful.

05:43.364 --> 05:45.705
I was thinking maybe you could come out.

05:45.708 --> 05:48.187
Maybe a long weekend. It's
only a six-hour flight.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.040
Well, is that really the right thing?

05:50.042 --> 05:51.135
What do you mean?

05:51.138 --> 05:52.782
I thought we were just..

05:52.784 --> 05:55.698
- Giving it time.
- Yes, and we are.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.744
- What? Wait, I couldn't hear that.
- We are.

05:58.746 --> 06:02.008
We are giving the
separation thing some time.

06:02.010 --> 06:05.118
I'm sorry, did you say we're
done with the separation?

06:05.121 --> 06:06.572
No. I said...

06:06.575 --> 06:07.839
_

06:07.842 --> 06:09.190
Yep.

06:09.192 --> 06:12.323
Nice talking to you, Kurt.

06:12.325 --> 06:15.326
I guess I don't understand.

06:15.328 --> 06:17.619
You want to represent me? Why?

06:17.622 --> 06:20.221
Because you're a good teacher.

06:20.224 --> 06:22.419
Uh, that might have gotten
me a free yogurt once,

06:22.422 --> 06:24.416
- but that's about it.
- Listen,

06:24.419 --> 06:26.979
you are the only teacher to
break through Malcolm's shell.

06:26.982 --> 06:28.986
You know, everybody
says I should move him

06:28.989 --> 06:32.125
to a private school, but
if-if everybody abandons

06:32.128 --> 06:35.064
- the public school system, it'll implode.
- Yeah, I know.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.502
I believe in public schools, too.

06:36.504 --> 06:37.572
My mother taught there.

06:37.575 --> 06:39.900
Oh, this is Maia.
She's one of our associates,

06:39.903 --> 06:41.437
and she has looked
through your contract.

06:41.439 --> 06:42.953
So, as you know,

06:42.956 --> 06:44.601
Amberson is a charter school,

06:44.604 --> 06:46.488
and charters are terrified

06:46.490 --> 06:48.505
about the threat of
union representation.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.144
Tell me about it.

06:50.146 --> 06:51.884
Sorry I'm late!

06:51.886 --> 06:54.452
Ooh, sorry. Oh, hey!

06:54.454 --> 06:56.282
Hey.

06:58.086 --> 07:00.850
I'm guessing I'm in the wrong place.

07:00.852 --> 07:02.243
Looks like it.

07:02.245 --> 07:04.332
They said second door down on the right.

07:04.334 --> 07:05.333
Lucca Quinn.

07:05.335 --> 07:06.334
Downstairs.

07:06.336 --> 07:07.766
Oh, there's a downstairs.

07:07.769 --> 07:09.899
I like that jacket, by the way.

07:09.910 --> 07:11.344
Thank you.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.122
Being a new, inexperienced mother,

07:13.125 --> 07:14.930
I need all the help I can get.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.888
You look so young to
have an eight-year-old.

07:16.891 --> 07:19.999
Oh, yeah. Thanks. Dave
and I started early.

07:20.001 --> 07:21.392
Dave is my husband.

07:21.394 --> 07:23.264
He's in the printing business,

07:23.266 --> 07:26.136
but he also loves fixing cars.

07:26.138 --> 07:28.312
We're trying to decide if
we should spend the money

07:28.314 --> 07:30.430
- on private school.
- Well, in my experience,

07:30.433 --> 07:32.837
Amberson is a public
school in name only.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.275
The parents are all proactive

07:34.277 --> 07:35.953
and treat it like a private school.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.583
I just worry about a
dangerous element here.

07:38.585 --> 07:40.833
I've heard talk of a certain teacher,

07:40.836 --> 07:42.450
- Mr. Coulson.
- Oh.

07:42.453 --> 07:44.391
Yes, he was replaced.

07:44.394 --> 07:46.365
I don't want to be racist or anything,

07:46.368 --> 07:49.638
but I always worry
about... different elements.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.988
That's not why he was fired.

07:51.990 --> 07:53.642
What?

07:53.644 --> 07:56.473
Well, I probably shouldn't say.

07:59.526 --> 08:01.735
Mr. Coulson, per your contract

08:01.738 --> 08:04.305
and, uh, previous agreement
between the parties,

08:04.307 --> 08:07.458
your appeal will be dealt
with here in arbitration.

08:07.461 --> 08:10.528
I'm the arbiter, and
my decision is final.

08:10.530 --> 08:13.183
Counselors, you all
understand what I just said?

08:13.185 --> 08:14.358
- Absolutely.
- Yes, Mr. Arbiter.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.317
- Absolutely, Mr. Arbiter.
- Oh. So respectful.

08:16.319 --> 08:18.014
That's a good sign.

08:18.016 --> 08:19.145
And you are?

08:19.147 --> 08:21.060
Oh. Nancy Crozier.

08:21.062 --> 08:22.627
Hi, Mr. Arbiter.

08:22.629 --> 08:25.064
It's-it's very good to be
here representing the school.

08:25.066 --> 08:27.676
I'm a-a member of the PTA.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.372
Secretary-Treasurer.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.060
And I volunteered when I heard

08:31.063 --> 08:34.369
that Mr. Coulson had
hired this powerhouse firm.

08:34.371 --> 08:36.589
Ooh, really? Powerhouse? Ooh,

08:36.592 --> 08:37.895
well, I am flattered.

08:37.899 --> 08:40.470
I-I'm not sure that's accurate.

08:40.472 --> 08:42.299
Champagne?

08:42.301 --> 08:44.301
Down the hall.

08:44.303 --> 08:45.911
Thanks.

08:45.913 --> 08:49.308
Apologies for "powerhouse."

08:50.981 --> 08:53.049
Ms. DuPont, how long
have you been a principal

08:53.051 --> 08:54.311
at Amberson Elementary?

08:54.313 --> 08:55.935
Five glorious years.

08:55.938 --> 08:58.112
And, uh, before that,
where did you work?

08:58.115 --> 09:00.376
I was principal at Holy Grace School.

09:00.379 --> 09:01.770
And were you ever involved in

09:01.773 --> 09:03.624
the firings of any teachers there?

09:03.627 --> 09:07.716
I-I was involved with a few dismissals.

09:07.719 --> 09:10.720
Were you involved with the
dismissal of a teacher named

09:10.723 --> 09:12.415
Arthur Prentiss?

09:12.418 --> 09:13.809
Yes.

09:13.811 --> 09:14.692
And why was he fired?

09:14.695 --> 09:16.025
That has nothing to do with this.

09:16.028 --> 09:18.419
- That's not what I asked.
- It was a Catholic school.

09:18.422 --> 09:20.286
It was within the school's rights.

09:20.289 --> 09:23.056
- What was within the school's rights?
- Uh, Mr. Arbiter,

09:23.059 --> 09:26.037
we will gladly stipulate that
Principal DuPont was forced

09:26.040 --> 09:28.432
by her last school to fire a teacher

09:28.434 --> 09:30.391
because he was gay.

09:30.393 --> 09:32.736
And why is this important?

09:32.739 --> 09:35.540
Because I'm gay.

09:35.543 --> 09:37.228
Okay.

09:37.231 --> 09:39.617
Any other questions? Please continue,

09:39.619 --> 09:41.532
- Ms. Crozier.
- Ms. DuPont,

09:41.534 --> 09:44.114
were you aware that
Sidney Coulson was gay?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.880
No. Definitely not.

09:45.883 --> 09:48.666
Were you aware that the
teacher at Holy Grace was gay?

09:48.669 --> 09:50.275
- Yes.
- And were you unhappy

09:50.278 --> 09:51.505
about that dismissal?

09:51.508 --> 09:54.501
- I was distraught.
- And did you swear to yourself

09:54.504 --> 09:56.852
that you would never dismiss
a teacher for anything

09:56.854 --> 09:59.028
- other than performance again?
- Yes.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.650
And how did you guarantee
that at Amberson?

10:01.653 --> 10:03.424
An algorithm.

10:03.426 --> 10:05.077
Decisions on teacher dismissals

10:05.079 --> 10:07.228
were based on an algorithm?

10:07.231 --> 10:09.471
Yes. So there could never be

10:09.474 --> 10:12.215
bias or prejudice in
hiring or firing again.

10:12.217 --> 10:13.247
Mr. Arbiter,

10:13.250 --> 10:15.215
all algorithms are pointless

10:15.218 --> 10:17.177
unless they are based on good data.

10:17.180 --> 10:19.703
And you would like access to the data.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.137
We would. Yes.

10:21.139 --> 10:22.399
Will we need to get into

10:22.401 --> 10:24.958
a subpoena situation here, Ms. Crozier?

10:24.961 --> 10:27.317
No. No. Um...

10:27.319 --> 10:29.798
I thought you might...

10:29.800 --> 10:33.410
want to take a look at these.

11:06.053 --> 11:08.532
How many so far?

11:08.534 --> 11:11.753
Ten clients. Eight lawyers.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.190
The rest are all us.

11:14.192 --> 11:16.366
- Wow.
- Yeah.

11:16.368 --> 11:19.700
We're gonna have a lot
of alcohol left over.

11:19.703 --> 11:22.394
Well, the office looks nice.

11:22.397 --> 11:24.200
Hey.

11:24.202 --> 11:26.408
Hello, Colin.

11:26.411 --> 11:28.378
Liz.

11:28.380 --> 11:32.247
So, how is it working with the enemy?

11:32.250 --> 11:33.456
- Lucrative.
- Mm.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.849
How are my cases?

11:34.852 --> 11:37.049
Yeah. Thanks a lot, by the way.

11:41.310 --> 11:42.458
Liz?

11:42.461 --> 11:44.752
Who is that with Lucca?

11:44.755 --> 11:46.264
N-New lawyer?

11:46.267 --> 11:48.267
Uh, no.

11:48.269 --> 11:49.971
Never seen him before.

11:49.974 --> 11:52.141
Probably somebody she's dating.

11:54.145 --> 11:57.127
Jerry. Thomas.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.974
- Mr. Boseman.
- How are you two?

11:58.976 --> 12:00.236
- Good, good, good.
- Good.

12:00.238 --> 12:02.947
Jerry... doesn't like elevators.

12:02.950 --> 12:05.807
Well, that one wasn't-wasn't so bad.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.417
This place is nice.

12:07.419 --> 12:09.158
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.421
- Yeah.
- Who-Who's she?

12:11.423 --> 12:13.247
Uh, Marissa.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.284
She's an investigator here.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.690
I'm gonna kill him.

12:21.289 --> 12:23.041
Whiskey. Ice.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.870
Tell me about Nancy Crozier.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.481
Why?

12:27.483 --> 12:30.135
Oh, because I'm facing
her in an arbitration.

12:30.137 --> 12:32.311
She's not exactly what I expected.

12:32.313 --> 12:33.502
You have any advice?

12:33.505 --> 12:35.706
This is a thing you do, isn't it?

12:35.708 --> 12:37.229
What is?

12:37.231 --> 12:40.496
You ask for advice in order
to ingratiate yourself.

12:41.496 --> 12:43.887
Vodka tonic.

12:43.890 --> 12:46.500
Your know, your "fuck it" mode

12:46.502 --> 12:49.130
is starting to feel more
like "fuck you" mode.

12:49.133 --> 12:51.351
Just appreciating your style.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.507
I'm just doing my job.

12:53.509 --> 12:55.838
And using what I confide in you

12:55.841 --> 12:57.623
to undercut me?

12:57.626 --> 12:59.947
Look, I-I thought Adrian already knew

12:59.950 --> 13:01.602
you were thinking of
leaving, that's all.

13:01.604 --> 13:03.908
Don't defend, don't apologize.

13:03.910 --> 13:06.043
It's more fun to go at each other.

13:07.435 --> 13:09.437
Okay.

13:11.135 --> 13:13.091
Good to know.

13:15.203 --> 13:18.053
Nancy plays at being
the nice girl while being tough.

13:18.055 --> 13:20.026
She's good.

13:20.029 --> 13:23.495
But her rhythm is
thrown off by objections.

13:25.817 --> 13:27.251
Diane!

13:27.254 --> 13:29.315
Elsbeth! What a pleasure!

13:29.318 --> 13:31.385
I know. Thank you.

13:31.388 --> 13:33.502
- Um, this is fantastic.
- Mm.

13:33.505 --> 13:35.331
Your offices... I love them.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.049
Where's all the furniture?

13:37.052 --> 13:38.854
Here, come and sit down.

13:38.857 --> 13:41.075
My God, what a fantastic dress.

13:41.078 --> 13:42.307
Really?

13:42.310 --> 13:44.382
Thank you. I was terrified to wear it.

13:45.952 --> 13:47.778
Ooh! What do you think
they're talking about?

13:47.780 --> 13:50.215
I have no idea.

13:50.217 --> 13:51.826
It's weird.

13:51.828 --> 13:54.538
We're just the background characters

13:54.541 --> 13:56.091
to their story.

13:56.093 --> 13:58.955
And-and they're just
the background characters

13:58.958 --> 14:01.251
to our story.

14:01.254 --> 14:04.273
And we're all just background
characters to his story.

14:04.275 --> 14:05.976
He could be the hero, and we could be

14:05.979 --> 14:07.140
the villains of the story.

14:07.143 --> 14:09.190
Or we're the heroes,
and he's the villain.

14:09.193 --> 14:11.527
That's what keeps us humble...

14:11.530 --> 14:13.184
- Not knowing.
- Or paranoid.

14:14.677 --> 14:17.523
You know, last week, I was
walking down the street,

14:17.526 --> 14:19.593
and there was this homeless man

14:19.595 --> 14:21.682
digging for bottles in the trash,

14:21.684 --> 14:24.093
and yelling at the top of his voice

14:24.096 --> 14:26.679
about the president and the country,

14:26.682 --> 14:29.030
and how we're all going insane.

14:29.033 --> 14:30.976
- Mm.
- And I realized:

14:30.979 --> 14:33.780
that's what my inner
monologue sounds like.

14:33.783 --> 14:37.480
And that's when I decided,
I've got to change.

14:37.482 --> 14:39.743
To what?

14:39.745 --> 14:43.713
To someone who's not going crazy.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.145
You're one of the most
successful women I know, Diane.

14:47.148 --> 14:49.971
I should be...

14:49.973 --> 14:51.407
Just...

14:55.674 --> 14:57.863
I love your necklace, by the way.

14:57.866 --> 14:59.763
Oh. Okay. Well, put it on.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.200
- Oh. No! No, no, no.
- Yes, here, put it on.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.543
And look... there's a
belt that goes with it.

15:05.546 --> 15:07.945
You can have that, as well.

15:07.947 --> 15:09.904
That's just...

15:09.906 --> 15:11.993
I never thought you liked me, Diane.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.386
Hey, you know what? That's my fault.

15:14.388 --> 15:16.998
Oh, my God, that is great!

15:18.463 --> 15:20.358
Rockin' party.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.393
Very... spacious.

15:22.396 --> 15:24.440
Yeah.

15:24.442 --> 15:26.379
Thanks for the invite, by the way.

15:26.382 --> 15:28.357
Thanks for coming.

15:28.359 --> 15:31.179
Who's the... the guy?

15:32.668 --> 15:34.163
Dominic.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.991
- Hmm.
- Why?

15:35.994 --> 15:38.192
Oh, just keeping up on your life.

15:38.195 --> 15:40.345
Jealous?

15:41.905 --> 15:45.098
- Staying informed.
- I'm so glad.

15:45.101 --> 15:47.902
- Hmm.
- Glad you came, Colin.

15:52.426 --> 15:54.165
Look at this.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.298
I mean, it's so boring up there.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.327
Well, anyway, I was
thinking about the algorithm.

15:59.330 --> 16:01.461
And do you know Jerry and Tom?

16:01.464 --> 16:03.116
They know everything about algorithms.

16:03.119 --> 16:05.601
- They're really smart.
- No, we just have...

16:05.604 --> 16:07.952
- Yeah, we are.
- Anyway, like you said,

16:07.955 --> 16:09.617
there are problems with algorithms

16:09.620 --> 16:11.054
like the one used at the school.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.578
They're... What are they?

16:12.581 --> 16:14.366
Incomplete something or other?

16:14.369 --> 16:16.325
Godel's incompleteness theorem.

16:16.328 --> 16:18.366
You're... adorable.

16:18.369 --> 16:20.468
Thank you. Do the short version.

16:20.471 --> 16:23.265
An algorithm is undependable
if it can't be proven.

16:23.268 --> 16:25.335
We think of algorithms, like, as magic,

16:25.338 --> 16:26.679
but they don't mean anything

16:26.682 --> 16:29.243
if you've only got 20
student tests, and 40

16:29.246 --> 16:31.814
- teacher reviews.
- We could destroy their case.

16:36.850 --> 16:39.981
It's called Godel's
incompleteness theorem.

16:39.984 --> 16:41.200
Mr. Arbiter, I'm...

16:41.203 --> 16:44.212
just a small-town girl from Michigan,

16:44.214 --> 16:46.258
- and I was never very good at math...
- Objection.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.390
I-I don't know what
Ms. Crozier's education

16:48.392 --> 16:49.870
has to do with any of this.

16:49.872 --> 16:51.393
Well, I didn't say that it did.

16:51.395 --> 16:53.091
Thank you. Continue.

16:53.093 --> 16:57.145
What does math have to do with this?

16:57.148 --> 16:58.749
- We've already proven...
- Objection.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.460
The attorney is testifying.

17:00.463 --> 17:02.896
Let's try to stay on point, shall we?

17:02.899 --> 17:04.422
What was your point?

17:05.695 --> 17:07.393
Ms. Crozier?

17:13.627 --> 17:15.865
That is really annoying.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.413
I have ADHD.

17:17.415 --> 17:18.894
What's your name?

17:18.896 --> 17:20.733
- Lucca.
- I'm Malcolm.

17:20.736 --> 17:23.099
I told the school
nurse I had a headache.

17:23.103 --> 17:24.646
But you don't.

17:24.650 --> 17:27.155
- I hate my new teacher.
- Can't like everyone.

17:27.157 --> 17:28.897
You'll stop with the ball?

17:28.900 --> 17:30.490
I don't know. It's fun.

17:30.493 --> 17:32.430
- Well, do something else.
- Like what?

17:32.433 --> 17:33.785
Like...

17:33.788 --> 17:35.634
Ah. I bet you can't build

17:35.637 --> 17:37.264
something cool with those paperclips.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.168
- Yes, I can.
- Whatever. Prove it.

17:41.369 --> 17:45.134
We work with algorithms,
and this isn't one we trust.

17:45.145 --> 17:48.276
The data points are subjective
and open to interpretation.

17:48.278 --> 17:49.930
What are the proportional weights

17:49.932 --> 17:52.803
between peer and parental reviews and

17:52.805 --> 17:54.456
state-mandated testing?

17:54.458 --> 17:58.635
It is five percent peer
review, five percent parental,

17:58.637 --> 18:00.694
90% testing.

18:00.697 --> 18:02.377
And would you consider

18:02.379 --> 18:04.510
state-mandated testing to be

18:04.512 --> 18:06.599
a subjective data point?

18:06.601 --> 18:09.412
Uh, no.

18:09.415 --> 18:12.084
No. Gentlemen, I think

18:12.087 --> 18:14.609
your point is well taken, but rejected.

18:15.741 --> 18:17.567
Okay.

18:17.569 --> 18:19.275
Well, this is a bit of a mess.

18:19.278 --> 18:21.733
- You were less than an hour.
- Yeah.

18:21.736 --> 18:24.770
Well, failure is fast.

18:24.773 --> 18:26.773
What you making?

18:26.776 --> 18:28.428
It's a Minecraft baby zombie.

18:28.431 --> 18:30.392
His name is Chicken.

18:30.395 --> 18:31.972
Cool.

18:31.974 --> 18:34.235
- Can I have my iPad?
- No.

18:34.237 --> 18:36.063
Lucca was here.

18:36.065 --> 18:37.761
- She doesn't like noise.
- Hmm.

18:37.763 --> 18:39.719
Why were you failing?

18:39.721 --> 18:41.678
I don't know.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.421
'Cause I'm not as good as I think I am.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.927
Hey, bubs?

18:49.930 --> 18:53.583
Last year, you did well on the
state-mandated test, didn't you?

18:53.586 --> 18:55.412
That was Mrs. Potter.

18:55.415 --> 18:57.639
She didn't like me.

18:57.642 --> 19:01.358
No, but y-you did well, right?

19:01.361 --> 19:03.001
On the test? Yes.

19:03.004 --> 19:04.662
Remember? We had ice cream.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.050
Yeah, yeah.

19:06.052 --> 19:09.131
But this year with Mr.
Coulson, what happened?

19:09.134 --> 19:10.850
I got a 73.

19:10.853 --> 19:13.631
Yeah, and last year how much?

19:13.634 --> 19:15.363
- 92.
- Okay.

19:15.365 --> 19:19.161
You did worse with a
teacher you really liked.

19:19.164 --> 19:22.121
That doesn't make sense.

19:22.124 --> 19:24.779
Mm-mm.

19:27.462 --> 19:29.897
Okay. Here's the bubble answer sheet

19:29.900 --> 19:31.728
- from Malcolm's test last year.
- Okay.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.947
Well, here's-here's this year's.

19:33.949 --> 19:36.873
So, what's different?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.270
What am I looking for?

19:41.353 --> 19:42.842
Erasures.

19:42.845 --> 19:46.152
There. There.

19:46.155 --> 19:47.938
- And there.
- Mm-hmm.

19:47.941 --> 19:51.640
Maybe a dozen of 'em, maybe more.

19:59.892 --> 20:01.453
I didn't erase these.

20:01.455 --> 20:04.569
But don't you find it odd
that all of the wrong answers

20:04.572 --> 20:07.546
on this test were erased, and
the correct ones were filled in?

20:07.548 --> 20:09.268
No. Students do that all the time.

20:09.271 --> 20:11.880
They make a mistake, and then
decide on the right answer.

20:11.883 --> 20:13.713
But every single
student in your class had

20:13.715 --> 20:16.642
at least five or six
erasures on their tests.

20:16.645 --> 20:19.155
Again, this is good news.
The students are thinking.

20:19.158 --> 20:21.766
And yet, in Mr. Coulson's class,
there isn't a single erasure.

20:21.769 --> 20:23.334
I'm offended by what you're implying.

20:23.337 --> 20:24.468
And what are we implying?

20:24.470 --> 20:27.830
- That I did this. Right?
- That you and the other teachers

20:27.831 --> 20:29.501
were so worried about being dismissed,

20:29.504 --> 20:31.983
that you went through the
answer sheets, and you changed

20:31.986 --> 20:34.767
just enough of the answers
to get a passing score.

20:34.770 --> 20:38.092
Except for one teacher, Mr.
Coulson, who was dismissed.

20:38.095 --> 20:39.143
Mr. Arbiter,

20:39.145 --> 20:42.280
I'm sorry, but this is wild conjecture.

20:42.283 --> 20:46.587
Yes, it's conjecture...
but I wouldn't call it wild.

20:46.590 --> 20:51.001
Mr. Arbiter, we ask that
you rule against the school.

20:51.004 --> 20:53.629
And I'm tempted to,
but here's my problem.

20:53.632 --> 20:55.196
Ms. Potter is saying

20:55.199 --> 20:58.133
that the students made
all the erasures, correct?

20:58.136 --> 20:59.332
Yes, definitely.

20:59.335 --> 21:02.947
So, without proof, I'm
afraid my hands are tied.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.664
Go.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.580
Get me proof.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.844
So, what now?

21:10.847 --> 21:11.800
I don't know.

21:11.803 --> 21:14.919
Maybe we go to the students
and ask if they erased?

21:14.922 --> 21:17.053
Hmm. Could Malcolm testify?

21:17.055 --> 21:19.449
I don't know. Let me ask.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.301
Oh, Mr. McVeigh. Hi.

21:25.304 --> 21:27.680
- Hello.
- I thought you were in L.A.

21:27.683 --> 21:30.587
I was. I wanted to surprise Diane.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.055
Oh, that's great.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.243
She'll be thrilled.

21:33.245 --> 21:34.941
I can, um, call her.

21:34.944 --> 21:38.180
- She's not answering her cell phone.
- Oh.

21:38.183 --> 21:40.313
I think she's at a deposition.

21:40.316 --> 21:41.524
She might be a while.

21:41.527 --> 21:42.852
Do you want me to call you?

21:42.855 --> 21:44.646
- Uh, sure.
- Okay.

21:44.648 --> 21:46.780
She'll be thrilled to see you.

21:52.621 --> 21:55.957
_

22:04.516 --> 22:06.083
Kurt?

22:07.932 --> 22:09.627
Can I ask you something?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.499
- You're into forensics.
- Ballistics.

22:11.501 --> 22:13.588
Right. This might sound ridiculous,

22:13.590 --> 22:17.333
but is there any forensics for
erasers... like, pencil erasers?

22:19.480 --> 22:22.363
Thank you for testifying for us, sir.

22:22.366 --> 22:25.642
Now what can you tell us about erasers?

22:25.645 --> 22:30.300
Erasers? Like on a... pencil?

22:30.302 --> 22:32.563
Yes.

22:32.565 --> 22:35.349
Are you sure you have the right guy?

22:35.351 --> 22:38.310
I'm from YourLawHelper.com.

22:43.924 --> 22:45.847
- Sorry. We...
- Yeah.

22:45.850 --> 22:48.982
Uh, sir, can you, uh...

22:48.985 --> 22:52.462
You've examined the third-grade
students' answer sheets.

22:52.465 --> 22:54.759
What can you tell us
about the erasure you see?

22:54.761 --> 22:56.370
Well, they didn't
come from the students.

22:56.372 --> 22:58.415
- And why are you so sure?
- They all came

22:58.417 --> 23:00.156
from one eraser, and it's vinyl.

23:00.158 --> 23:02.419
The students didn't have vinyl erasers.

23:02.421 --> 23:04.547
Mr. Arbiter, the algorithm

23:04.550 --> 23:07.207
is worthless because it depended

23:07.209 --> 23:09.777
on the accuracy of
state-mandated testing,

23:09.780 --> 23:12.254
but as forensic evidence proves,

23:12.257 --> 23:15.222
almost all of the teachers
tampered with their tests,

23:15.225 --> 23:18.915
except for one teacher, one
honest teacher, who was fired...

23:18.918 --> 23:20.657
Mr. Coulson.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.398
Ms. Crozier?

23:25.357 --> 23:27.229
You have a response?

23:30.347 --> 23:32.355
Is my daughter's test in there?

23:38.718 --> 23:41.154
Ah! You got your job back.

23:41.156 --> 23:43.112
Same pay, same position.

23:43.114 --> 23:45.070
- That's great. Um...
- Oh, God.

23:45.072 --> 23:46.790
Malcolm is gonna be so thrilled.

23:46.793 --> 23:50.368
Actually, I was offered a new job.

23:50.371 --> 23:54.036
- You were?
- Dwight Academy? The private school.

23:54.038 --> 23:57.648
They heard I'd been let go,
and they offered me a position.

23:57.650 --> 23:59.379
- Just today.
- Mm.

23:59.382 --> 24:02.827
Uh, it's more money, so I
have to consider my options.

24:02.829 --> 24:05.395
I wanted to thank you
again for what you've done.

24:05.397 --> 24:06.875
So we, uh...

24:06.877 --> 24:08.746
lost another good one.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.577
Yeah. I still believe in public schools.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.106
_

24:43.616 --> 24:46.129
A.B.C.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.813
Avoid, Barricade, Confront.

24:50.816 --> 24:54.126
If there is an active shooter situation,

24:54.129 --> 24:58.063
your first line of defense
is "A," avoid the gunman.

24:59.918 --> 25:01.930
Hey. Where do you guys want this?

25:01.932 --> 25:03.740
- What is that?
- Alcohol.

25:03.743 --> 25:06.501
Office at the end of
the hall on the right.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.545
- Thanks.
- You hear a gunshot.

25:08.547 --> 25:11.722
You look out into the hall.
You see a man with a gun.

25:11.724 --> 25:14.116
Could be the shooter.
Could be building security.

25:14.118 --> 25:15.892
- You may think you know what's going on...
- Lucca.

25:15.894 --> 25:17.337
- But you don't.
- There are two men here for you.

25:17.339 --> 25:18.773
- Not yet. That's why you avoid.
- Who?

25:18.775 --> 25:19.793
FBI agents.

25:21.625 --> 25:24.095
Liz, we couldn't hear
that. Where are you?

25:24.098 --> 25:25.866
I'm in the car.

25:25.869 --> 25:27.564
Uh, what do they want?

25:27.566 --> 25:29.407
They won't say.

25:29.410 --> 25:31.092
- Okay.
- All right?

25:32.832 --> 25:34.832
"B," barricade.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.473
You hear gunfire.

25:36.476 --> 25:37.779
Uh, Marissa?

25:37.782 --> 25:39.881
You can stay here.

25:39.883 --> 25:41.317
Gentlemen.

25:41.319 --> 25:42.579
May I help you?

25:42.581 --> 25:44.364
I'm Agent Boggs. This is Horvath.

25:44.366 --> 25:45.860
We have a few questions to ask you.

25:45.863 --> 25:47.317
Regarding?

25:47.327 --> 25:49.798
This is regarding your
brother, Dominic Quinn.

25:58.163 --> 26:00.642
Uh, maybe we can meet alone, Ms. Quinn.

26:00.644 --> 26:02.644
Actually, this is my lawyer.

26:02.646 --> 26:05.517
And I'd like her to stay.

26:05.519 --> 26:07.204
Marissa Gold.

26:07.207 --> 26:09.816
When's the last time you
saw your brother, Ms. Quinn?

26:09.819 --> 26:12.103
Four years ago. What is this about?

26:12.106 --> 26:13.665
Just some preliminary questions.

26:13.668 --> 26:16.000
You haven't seen him since he
was released from Vackerville?

26:16.002 --> 26:18.189
Vacaville. And no, not since then.

26:18.192 --> 26:20.053
And who else does he know in Chicago?

26:20.055 --> 26:22.368
Why don't you tell
me what this is about.

26:22.371 --> 26:24.056
We're not at liberty to say.

26:24.059 --> 26:26.538
Has he retained any
friendships from prison?

26:26.540 --> 26:28.455
- I have no idea.
- Has he written to you?

26:31.806 --> 26:33.884
I think I'll call a
halt to this, gentlemen,

26:33.887 --> 26:34.843
as Lucca's lawyer.

26:34.846 --> 26:36.954
It's an easy question, Ms. Quinn.

26:36.957 --> 26:38.463
Tell me what it's about,

26:38.465 --> 26:40.205
and I'll answer your question.

26:42.626 --> 26:44.120
If he writes you again, Ms. Quinn,

26:44.122 --> 26:45.382
please keep us informed.

26:45.384 --> 26:46.772
He hasn't written me a first time,

26:46.775 --> 26:49.124
and I can't help you if
you won't tell me anything.

26:49.127 --> 26:51.519
If you change your
mind, here's our card.

26:51.521 --> 26:53.478
It's not about changing my mind.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.482
What, he's appealing?

26:58.068 --> 27:00.329
Jay?

27:00.332 --> 27:02.332
What's going on?

27:02.335 --> 27:04.814
I need help finding my fuck-up brother,

27:04.817 --> 27:07.529
and I don't want other people
to find out. Can you help me?

27:07.532 --> 27:09.017
- What do you have?
- Name.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.571
Social Security. Some
dummy e-mail addresses

27:11.574 --> 27:13.051
for his shady schemes.

27:13.054 --> 27:15.360
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

27:15.363 --> 27:17.414
How long do you think it will take you?

27:17.416 --> 27:19.591
I wouldn't go anywhere.

27:19.593 --> 27:21.907
Jay, do you have a minute?

27:41.266 --> 27:43.204
Look what the cat dragged in.

27:43.207 --> 27:44.746
What are you doing in Chicago?

27:44.748 --> 27:47.183
Working. See?

27:47.185 --> 27:49.451
How'd you find me?

27:49.454 --> 27:52.145
Social Security number.

27:52.147 --> 27:53.320
That's right.

27:53.322 --> 27:55.548
The benefits of a big firm.

27:55.551 --> 27:56.845
Yeah.

27:56.847 --> 27:58.673
Poor little Dominic.

27:58.675 --> 28:01.110
Never given the advantages
of his big sister.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.896
I didn't say that, did I?

28:06.238 --> 28:08.727
Stop digging up old battles, sis.

28:08.729 --> 28:12.359
The Feds came by my office today.

28:12.362 --> 28:14.623
That's right.

28:14.626 --> 28:17.834
Tell me about those old battles.

28:17.837 --> 28:19.728
It has nothing to do with you.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.957
Then why am I talking
to the Feds, Dominic?

28:21.959 --> 28:23.959
Huh?

28:23.961 --> 28:26.931
I'll get Mom on the phone right now.

28:26.934 --> 28:28.544
No.

28:30.185 --> 28:32.620
I'm being sued.

28:32.622 --> 28:33.882
For?

28:33.884 --> 28:35.144
An app I created.

28:35.146 --> 28:36.798
BigHouseLegal.com.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.326
They claim I'm practicing
law without a license.

28:39.329 --> 28:40.306
It's bullshit.

28:40.309 --> 28:41.790
So it's another one of your scams?

28:41.793 --> 28:44.181
It's not a scam. We're
in depositions right now.

28:44.184 --> 28:46.721
They probably want old dirt
on me. What'd you tell them?

28:46.723 --> 28:48.337
Who's representing you?

28:48.340 --> 28:50.419
No one.

28:50.422 --> 28:52.422
I'm representing myself.

28:52.424 --> 28:54.337
Oh, dear God.

28:54.339 --> 28:56.079
Yes, always the brother who fucks up.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.689
You know, you never
feel good about yourself

28:57.691 --> 28:58.907
unless you can scold me.

28:58.909 --> 29:01.243
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

29:01.246 --> 29:02.813
I'm going.

29:05.612 --> 29:07.614
I didn't tell them anything.

29:09.659 --> 29:12.225
They wanted to know if you
still have friends in prison.

29:12.227 --> 29:15.228
They might be trying
to expand their scope.

29:15.230 --> 29:17.188
Good luck.

29:22.367 --> 29:23.932
Lucca Quinn?

29:23.934 --> 29:25.630
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

29:25.632 --> 29:28.502
I'm trying to be kinder
with it these days.

29:28.504 --> 29:30.071
You've just been served.

29:37.905 --> 29:39.731
What's wrong?

29:39.733 --> 29:41.907
Nothing.

29:41.909 --> 29:43.343
Family.

29:43.345 --> 29:44.736
Oh.

29:44.738 --> 29:46.825
You know I'm an expert on that.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.740
Good point.

29:48.742 --> 29:50.219
I have a brother

29:50.221 --> 29:53.005
who has held a grudge
against me all his life.

29:53.007 --> 29:55.137
I was the good student,

29:55.139 --> 29:58.967
he was... hyper and hard to handle.

29:58.969 --> 30:02.275
He thought our parents liked me better.

30:02.277 --> 30:04.494
Did they?

30:04.496 --> 30:06.775
Yes.

30:06.778 --> 30:08.553
So I was the one who got to go

30:08.556 --> 30:10.425
to college and law school,

30:10.428 --> 30:12.328
and he went into the military

30:12.330 --> 30:14.617
and then got arrested
for selling marijuana.

30:14.620 --> 30:16.576
And now,

30:16.579 --> 30:19.161
I've been subpoenaed
to testify against him

30:19.163 --> 30:23.076
for some idiotic app of
his called BigHouseLegal.

30:23.079 --> 30:26.386
Wait, BigHouseLegal.com?

30:26.388 --> 30:28.475
- I think so. Why?
- I have a friend

30:28.477 --> 30:30.085
at ACLU who was telling me about this.

30:30.087 --> 30:31.165
He says it's great.

30:31.168 --> 30:33.296
Oh, no, that must be something else.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.517
This is a scam.

30:35.484 --> 30:37.587
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

30:37.590 --> 30:41.008
My friend says it really
gives inmates a voice.

30:41.011 --> 30:43.011
What-what's he being sued for?

30:43.013 --> 30:46.058
Um, practicing law without a license.

30:46.060 --> 30:48.625
And they want to shut it down? Too bad.

30:48.627 --> 30:50.018
Maia.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.628
You said you wanted a mentor?

30:51.630 --> 30:52.934
Uh, yes, I do.

30:52.936 --> 30:54.721
Good. Let's go.

31:10.032 --> 31:12.432
Hi. It's Lucca.

31:12.434 --> 31:14.259
What are you doing?

31:16.090 --> 31:18.743
Wow. What happened to all the furniture?

31:18.745 --> 31:20.527
It's temporary. We're having a party

31:20.529 --> 31:21.789
to show off the new offices.

31:21.791 --> 31:23.356
- Ooh.
- Who are you here to see?

31:23.358 --> 31:25.793
Uh, um, Lucca Quinn.

31:25.795 --> 31:27.577
Downstairs. Second door to the right.

31:27.579 --> 31:29.392
Okay, great. Thanks.

31:29.395 --> 31:31.982
Wow, twice in one day. This
is like my first communion.

31:31.985 --> 31:34.884
- The Department of Correction is suing you?
- Yeah. Why?

31:34.887 --> 31:36.147
They want to bankrupt you.

31:36.150 --> 31:37.718
I know. What do you need, sis?

31:37.720 --> 31:38.980
- I looked at your site.
- Okay.

31:38.982 --> 31:41.904
- So...
- It's good. It serves a purpose.

31:41.907 --> 31:44.116
I wish I'd thought of it.

31:44.118 --> 31:45.944
Look, don't patronize me.

31:45.946 --> 31:49.014
I'm not. Jesus. Can you not just
take what I say at face value?

31:49.017 --> 31:50.513
Are you surprised?

31:50.515 --> 31:52.998
The last time we talked,
you said to never call you.

31:53.001 --> 31:55.975
- I wonder why. Because you stole money.
- Because I needed bail money.

31:55.978 --> 31:57.486
- What you want to do, keep me in there?
- Whatever. Okay.

31:57.488 --> 31:59.609
Fine. It's past.

31:59.611 --> 32:01.698
You can't represent
yourself in a deposition.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.001
You need a lawyer.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.454
Lucca, thanks. But
you're being deposed, too,

32:05.457 --> 32:07.239
- so I can't expect you...
- No, not me.

32:07.242 --> 32:09.880
Lucca, hi. I'm so sorry.

32:09.883 --> 32:12.100
This place is so confusing.
You have to go upstairs

32:12.102 --> 32:14.799
- to go downstairs?
- I know. It's about security.

32:14.801 --> 32:16.931
Um, Elsbeth, I want to
introduce you to my brother,

32:16.933 --> 32:17.932
Dominic.

32:17.934 --> 32:20.021
Your brother?

32:20.023 --> 32:21.459
Oh, my God. Hi!

32:23.113 --> 32:25.113
Uh, Dominic, this is Elsbeth Tascioni,

32:25.115 --> 32:26.941
one of the best lawyers I've ever met.

32:26.943 --> 32:29.770
Na... aw. No, I am not.

32:29.772 --> 32:31.525
I'm just...

32:33.907 --> 32:35.863
So, did you just move in here?

32:35.865 --> 32:38.257
Yeah.

32:39.504 --> 32:40.851
Um, the Department of Corrections

32:40.854 --> 32:42.753
has brought a civil suit against Dominic

32:42.756 --> 32:44.740
for a robo-lawyering
app that he invented,

32:44.743 --> 32:46.265
and we're both being deposed.

32:46.267 --> 32:47.614
Robo-lawyering.

32:47.616 --> 32:49.568
Really? What does that do?

32:49.571 --> 32:53.199
It helps prison inmates
sue for mistreatment.

32:53.970 --> 32:55.448
Wow.

32:55.450 --> 32:59.017
I once spent a long weekend in prison,

32:59.019 --> 33:01.802
and it was not pleasant, believe you me.

33:01.804 --> 33:04.718
No, wait, that was Niagara Falls.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.775
Yeah, that's right.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.069
My honeymoon.

33:08.071 --> 33:10.158
People say it's romantic, but...

33:10.161 --> 33:13.773
Anyway, I'm ready to go if you want me.

33:18.386 --> 33:21.193
So, take me through this.

33:21.196 --> 33:23.260
How does your website work?

33:26.655 --> 33:29.743
Well, if you're in prison
and you have a complaint...

33:29.745 --> 33:31.353
No medical attention,

33:31.355 --> 33:33.087
denial of television privileges,

33:33.090 --> 33:36.096
or even harassment by
guards... You log on,

33:36.099 --> 33:38.926
and the website takes you
through 50 to 80 questions

33:38.928 --> 33:40.580
to help narrow down your complaint.

33:40.582 --> 33:42.756
Is that it?

33:42.758 --> 33:43.844
No.

33:43.846 --> 33:45.585
The site then offers advice

33:45.587 --> 33:47.239
as to which court to file your complaint

33:47.241 --> 33:50.198
and will shoot out
the paperwork for you.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.201
Let me ask you, Mr. Quinn,
have you attended law school?

33:53.203 --> 33:54.853
No.

33:54.856 --> 33:57.248
And are you licensed to practice law

33:57.251 --> 34:00.034
in any state or territory in the U.S.?

34:00.036 --> 34:01.601
- No.
- And yet,

34:01.603 --> 34:03.516
here you are giving legal advice online.

34:03.518 --> 34:04.778
Is that a question,

34:04.780 --> 34:05.775
Mr. Schmidt?

34:05.778 --> 34:08.042
'Cause it sounded like a comment.

34:08.043 --> 34:11.641
Just put a question
mark on the end, ma'am.

34:11.645 --> 34:13.670
I'm just helping to file paperwork.

34:13.672 --> 34:15.179
They don't...

34:15.181 --> 34:17.255
they don't make it easy for cons.

34:17.259 --> 34:18.748
I wonder why.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.708
This guides inmates through
the process, that's all.

34:21.710 --> 34:23.385
Never said I was a lawyer.

34:23.388 --> 34:24.561
Mr. Quinn, I could say

34:24.563 --> 34:25.954
I'm not a mugger,

34:25.956 --> 34:28.436
but if I take your wallet
at knifepoint, guess what?

34:28.438 --> 34:29.989
Whoa. That's a weird analogy.

34:29.993 --> 34:31.563
Does anyone else find that weird?

34:31.565 --> 34:33.458
I'm finished for the moment.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.199
Mr. Quinn, do you know why

34:35.202 --> 34:37.641
the Department of Correction
is trying to stop your website?

34:37.645 --> 34:38.775
My guess is

34:38.777 --> 34:40.900
they usually receive
under 1,000 complaints

34:40.902 --> 34:42.424
a year from convicts.

34:42.427 --> 34:45.364
With my site, they've
received over 13,000.

34:45.368 --> 34:47.690
Yes, it's called abuse of process, sir.

34:47.692 --> 34:49.118
That's why we're suing.

34:49.121 --> 34:51.126
- It's a common law intentional tort.
- You know,

34:51.129 --> 34:52.956
Mr. Schmidt, I like you.

34:52.958 --> 34:55.263
I especially like the color of that tie,

34:55.264 --> 34:57.526
but I don't really need to depose you.

34:57.528 --> 35:00.094
'Cause I'm deposing Dominic.

35:00.096 --> 35:01.634
Hey.

35:01.637 --> 35:03.860
Have you ever used WebMD?

35:03.863 --> 35:05.048
Have... Yes.

35:05.051 --> 35:07.622
And did you ever think
it was your doctor?

35:07.625 --> 35:09.321
No.

35:09.323 --> 35:10.670
- No.
- Yeah, the difference is

35:10.672 --> 35:13.325
there are actual
doctors behind that site.

35:13.327 --> 35:15.109
Oh! Um...

35:15.111 --> 35:16.937
just got a little...

35:16.939 --> 35:18.591
something here.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.962
You really think I can sue?

35:23.965 --> 35:25.226
- Are you kidding me?
- What is this?

35:25.228 --> 35:27.204
I come to this grocery
store all the time.

35:27.207 --> 35:28.688
They should have cleaned up that spill.

35:28.690 --> 35:30.150
But how could I go about it?

35:30.152 --> 35:32.022
I can help you fill out the paperwork.

35:32.025 --> 35:33.328
Where to file, all that.

35:33.331 --> 35:35.107
What'd you say your name was, hon?

35:35.110 --> 35:37.349
- Mary Ann Daley.
- Mr. Schmidt,

35:37.351 --> 35:40.395
do you employ a Mary Ann
Daley at your law office?

35:40.397 --> 35:41.983
Oh, come on.

35:41.986 --> 35:43.811
She's your secretary, isn't she?

35:43.814 --> 35:45.495
And a real sweetheart.

35:45.498 --> 35:47.533
Very nice.

35:47.535 --> 35:50.144
Do you happen to know if
she's a licensed attorney?

35:50.146 --> 35:53.408
Ooh, I'm gonna take that as a "no."

35:53.410 --> 35:54.772
Uh, Dominic,

35:54.775 --> 35:56.889
are you making any money from this site?

35:56.892 --> 35:59.023
You don't tend to make
money from inmates.

35:59.025 --> 36:00.807
That's why they have so much trouble

36:00.809 --> 36:02.253
- accessing lawyers.
- Hmm.

36:02.256 --> 36:03.592
Mm-hmm.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.379
So why do you do it?

36:09.948 --> 36:12.089
- I was in prison in California.
- Yes.

36:12.092 --> 36:14.125
We'll get to that later

36:14.127 --> 36:16.301
when I depose your sister tomorrow.

36:25.312 --> 36:27.051
Here.

36:27.053 --> 36:28.313
Thanks.

36:28.315 --> 36:30.358
- You were right about her.
- Right?

36:30.360 --> 36:31.925
- Hmm.
- That's some weird...

36:31.927 --> 36:34.452
savant stuff.

36:34.455 --> 36:36.495
Nice dress.

36:36.497 --> 36:39.150
Thanks.

36:39.152 --> 36:41.413
I did think there'd be
more people here, though.

36:41.415 --> 36:42.979
Hmm.

36:42.981 --> 36:44.329
Are you pregnant?

36:46.159 --> 36:47.682
What?

36:48.725 --> 36:50.725
You're not drinking.

36:50.728 --> 36:52.511
You're carrying yourself different.

36:52.513 --> 36:54.165
No, I'm... no, I'm not.

36:54.167 --> 36:55.907
Yes, you are.

36:58.519 --> 36:59.737
Do Mom and Dad know?

37:01.783 --> 37:03.435
Mm-mm.

37:03.437 --> 37:04.916
Who's the dad?

37:08.268 --> 37:10.094
Someone out of the picture.

37:10.096 --> 37:12.400
- Do you want him in the picture?
- No.

37:12.402 --> 37:13.923
So it wasn't planned?

37:13.925 --> 37:15.708
Shh.

37:15.710 --> 37:17.623
Hi.

37:17.625 --> 37:20.582
Can we just, uh, be a little quieter?

37:20.584 --> 37:21.757
Okay.

37:21.759 --> 37:23.803
No.

37:23.805 --> 37:25.283
We broke up,

37:25.285 --> 37:28.150
and then we got back
together for one night.

37:28.153 --> 37:30.636
Oh. Does he know?

37:30.638 --> 37:32.725
- No.
- You gonna tell him?

37:32.727 --> 37:34.030
No.

37:34.033 --> 37:35.550
Well, that's kind of shitty, Lucca.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.077
No, it isn't.

37:37.079 --> 37:39.125
Telling him would be shitty.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.517
It's so weird, us talking about this.

37:42.519 --> 37:45.346
I haven't told anyone.

37:45.348 --> 37:48.523
You can't get rid of family.

37:48.525 --> 37:52.964
You can try but...
they always come back.

37:54.966 --> 37:57.228
You know, it was tough love.

37:57.230 --> 37:59.230
That's all.

37:59.232 --> 38:01.449
Not lending you money.

38:03.236 --> 38:05.845
I know.

38:05.847 --> 38:07.238
I was an asshole.

38:07.240 --> 38:11.024
Yeah, but I was, too.

38:11.026 --> 38:13.200
I have a good effect on you.

38:13.202 --> 38:14.897
I soften you.

38:17.206 --> 38:19.380
That's my fault.

38:19.382 --> 38:22.775
You can be very hard.

38:22.777 --> 38:25.038
I've missed you, sis.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.986
I know.

38:27.989 --> 38:29.970
Me, too.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.267
Hormones are awful.

38:36.269 --> 38:37.746
Yeah.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.446
Whiskey. Ice.

38:40.688 --> 38:43.316
What were you saying about me?

38:43.319 --> 38:44.797
Excuse me?

38:44.799 --> 38:47.539
Well, you were pointing over here.

38:47.541 --> 38:48.759
Oh.

38:48.762 --> 38:52.978
Uh, how we're all, uh, lead
characters in our own story,

38:52.981 --> 38:56.417
and everybody else is
a background player.

38:56.419 --> 38:59.899
Whoa. Cartesian a posteriori knowledge.

38:59.901 --> 39:04.164
Sorry, I was a philosophy major at NYU.

39:04.166 --> 39:06.514
With a minor in bartending.

39:07.996 --> 39:10.858
You have the best laugh.

39:10.861 --> 39:12.077
Oh, well, thank you.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.956
Me, I have a terrible laugh.

39:13.958 --> 39:17.046
My laugh scares small children.

39:17.049 --> 39:19.313
Okay, let's hear.

39:22.123 --> 39:23.647
Say something funny.

39:26.536 --> 39:29.015
What do you call 20 skydiving lawyers?

39:29.017 --> 39:30.756
What?

39:30.758 --> 39:32.366
Skeet.

39:34.457 --> 39:35.944
Oh, God, that is terrible.

39:40.339 --> 39:41.990
So what are you doing after this?

39:41.993 --> 39:43.985
Why?

39:43.988 --> 39:48.339
Well, I am tear-gassing
an alt-right meeting.

39:48.341 --> 39:50.732
Come on. Come on.

39:50.734 --> 39:54.301
That-that laugh, it just cheers me up.

39:54.303 --> 39:57.565
Yeah, well... Sorry.

39:57.567 --> 40:00.264
That is the perfect hand
to hold a tear gas canister.

40:01.658 --> 40:03.267
Among other things.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.573
_

40:32.940 --> 40:34.401
Oh.

40:36.261 --> 40:38.800
- Where you going?
- Work.

40:38.802 --> 40:40.796
Don't go to work.

40:40.799 --> 40:43.016
Nothing good comes of that.

40:43.019 --> 40:44.331
I'll make money.

40:44.334 --> 40:45.753
You don't need money.

40:45.756 --> 40:48.291
In two years, money
will become outdated.

40:48.294 --> 40:49.859
It'll all be barter.

40:49.861 --> 40:52.166
Two years is a long time.

40:52.168 --> 40:55.648
Hey. Call me.

40:55.650 --> 40:57.261
No.

41:02.053 --> 41:05.175
_

41:11.902 --> 41:14.425
Your brother has an
extensive criminal past,

41:14.427 --> 41:16.601
doesn't he?

41:16.603 --> 41:18.627
Depends on how you define "extensive."

41:18.630 --> 41:21.435
Well, he forged your
name on checks, correct?

41:23.349 --> 41:26.262
Yes. And he took out
credit cards in your name?

41:26.264 --> 41:27.742
Yes.

41:27.744 --> 41:32.007
And did he borrow money
he has not paid back?

41:32.009 --> 41:33.269
No.

41:33.271 --> 41:35.077
I gifted him that money.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.709
As of when?

41:37.711 --> 41:39.733
Recently.

41:39.736 --> 41:42.844
Yesterday?

41:42.846 --> 41:44.455
Yes.

41:44.457 --> 41:47.221
And were you given the chance to offer

41:47.224 --> 41:50.460
character testimony at his
trial for selling marijuana?

41:50.463 --> 41:52.682
Yes.

41:52.685 --> 41:57.275
But you did not... question mark.

41:57.278 --> 41:58.946
Okay. Let me say this.

41:58.949 --> 42:02.429
My brother has struggled in his life.

42:02.431 --> 42:03.996
He loved history.

42:03.998 --> 42:07.303
He was accepted at NYU.

42:07.305 --> 42:09.393
But my parents didn't
have the money to send him,

42:09.395 --> 42:11.830
because they spent it on my education.

42:11.832 --> 42:14.147
So he had several years
where he struggled.

42:14.150 --> 42:17.444
And what you're asking
about are those years.

42:17.446 --> 42:19.620
But he should be judged
by what he's doing now,

42:19.622 --> 42:22.804
which is something
compassionate and incredible.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.757
Okay.

42:25.759 --> 42:28.281
Nice speech.

42:28.283 --> 42:30.762
Let's turn to his conviction in 2012.

42:30.764 --> 42:31.980
Objection.

42:31.982 --> 42:33.655
None of this will be allowed in court.

42:33.658 --> 42:36.096
Maybe not civilly, but criminally.

42:36.099 --> 42:38.033
What are you talking about?

42:38.036 --> 42:39.727
Barratry and champerty.

42:39.729 --> 42:41.432
Incitement to vexing litigation.

42:41.435 --> 42:43.644
Your history, Mr. Quinn,
will come in very handy there

42:43.646 --> 42:45.330
when the attorney
general prosecutes you.

42:45.333 --> 42:47.213
Why are you so afraid?

42:47.216 --> 42:50.563
All I'm doing is bringing
the law to the masses.

42:50.566 --> 42:54.568
Oh, come on.

42:54.570 --> 42:57.441
Grow up, all three of you.

42:57.443 --> 42:59.225
I should let you win.

42:59.227 --> 43:01.053
Have you ever thought about what happens

43:01.056 --> 43:03.384
if this website succeeds?

43:03.387 --> 43:04.952
It replaces you.

43:04.955 --> 43:07.015
And you. And me.

43:07.018 --> 43:08.843
I'm fighting for our jobs.

43:08.845 --> 43:11.401
I'm fighting so we're not
replaced by robo-lawyers.

43:11.404 --> 43:12.882
And what are you doing?

43:12.885 --> 43:14.806
You're saying we don't matter.

43:14.808 --> 43:18.413
How much legal education
do we have between us?

43:18.416 --> 43:22.640
A decade in school,
another 50 in experience?

43:22.642 --> 43:25.726
And you're arguing we can
be replaced by a computer?

43:25.729 --> 43:27.772
Well, good luck with that.

43:27.775 --> 43:30.691
But I'll line up with the humans.

43:30.693 --> 43:32.954
Not let's, again,

43:32.956 --> 43:36.090
turn to your brother's
conviction in 2012.

43:38.047 --> 43:40.961
Hey, Carter, what are you doing here?

43:40.964 --> 43:42.486
Here? I'm in depositions.

43:42.488 --> 43:44.077
Just heading out to get some air.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.471
What case?

43:45.474 --> 43:47.428
You didn't know?

43:47.431 --> 43:50.711
Your firm is defending a
self-help bot for prisoners.

43:50.713 --> 43:52.650
Hey, Diane.

43:52.653 --> 43:55.069
Do you know about this
bot case in depositions?

43:55.072 --> 43:56.499
No.

43:56.502 --> 43:58.589
Your associate, Lucca
Quinn's brother is poised

43:58.591 --> 44:01.244
to make lawyers as
expendable as travel agents.

44:01.247 --> 44:03.204
You're destroying us.

44:03.207 --> 44:06.378
Sounds like a good idea.

44:06.381 --> 44:08.860
You need to get your
house in order, Adrian.

44:08.862 --> 44:10.557
This will be a disaster
for defense lawyers.

44:10.559 --> 44:11.774
And last time I looked,

44:11.777 --> 44:14.082
- you are a defense lawyer.
- Yeah, let me get into it.

44:14.084 --> 44:15.388
Yeah, you'd better.

44:15.390 --> 44:17.523
Before it's too late.

44:20.608 --> 44:22.608
Thank you for agreeing to testify, sir.

44:22.611 --> 44:25.443
Would you call yourself
an expert on the law?

44:26.756 --> 44:28.758
Um...

44:31.233 --> 44:32.624
Mr. Radosh.

44:32.627 --> 44:35.843
Your site, YourLawHelper.com,

44:35.845 --> 44:40.205
it provides clients with
legal forms, templates

44:40.208 --> 44:42.240
for wills and contracts

44:42.243 --> 44:44.525
- and even residential leases.
- That's correct.

44:44.528 --> 44:46.158
Why don't you get your
pencil expert back?

44:46.160 --> 44:47.725
I think he might be more relevant.

44:47.727 --> 44:49.640
Eraser expert.

44:49.642 --> 44:50.902
Mmm.

44:50.904 --> 44:53.165
People from all over the country

44:53.167 --> 44:55.036
use your service, but what you do

44:55.038 --> 44:56.995
isn't the practice of law, is it?

44:56.997 --> 44:59.258
No. No. We don't tell people
what forms to fill out,

44:59.260 --> 45:00.603
they decide what they need,

45:00.606 --> 45:02.283
and we give them the
forms they requested.

45:02.286 --> 45:04.349
Because if you tell people
what form to fill out,

45:04.352 --> 45:05.691
that's the practice of law?

45:05.694 --> 45:07.085
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

45:07.088 --> 45:09.181
Mr. Radosh, do you recognize

45:09.183 --> 45:12.532
this language? "This
legal document service

45:12.534 --> 45:15.840
is no substitute for the
advice of an attorney."

45:15.842 --> 45:18.494
Yes. That's the disclaimer
we use on YourLawHelper.com

45:18.496 --> 45:20.845
so people know we're not
a substitute for a lawyer.

45:20.847 --> 45:22.600
Actually, it's the language

45:22.603 --> 45:25.405
BigHouseLegal uses to tell its customers

45:25.408 --> 45:28.722
the site is no substitute for a lawyer.

45:28.724 --> 45:30.681
Yeah. Uh...

45:30.683 --> 45:34.423
And has your website
been sued, Mr. Radosh?

45:34.425 --> 45:36.948
Yes, many times for practicing law

45:36.950 --> 45:38.944
without a license, but we've prevailed

45:38.947 --> 45:40.952
- in every suit.
- Mm-hmm.

45:40.954 --> 45:42.214
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

45:42.216 --> 45:43.650
And do you know the difference

45:43.652 --> 45:46.135
between an ivory
eraser and a number two?

45:49.658 --> 45:52.400
That was a joke.

45:53.444 --> 45:54.966
Apologies.

45:54.968 --> 45:57.708
Lucca, can we have a minute?

45:57.710 --> 46:00.710
I've just been brought up to
speed with what's going on here.

46:00.713 --> 46:04.280
Can I ask what the fee arrangements are?

46:04.283 --> 46:06.281
Mine?

46:06.283 --> 46:08.197
My retainer's $50,000.

46:08.200 --> 46:10.198
You told me she was doing it pro bono.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.026
See, here's what I'd like to propose:

46:12.028 --> 46:14.343
Dominic, I checked out your site.

46:14.346 --> 46:16.030
It's a great start.

46:16.032 --> 46:17.641
I want to purchase it.

46:17.643 --> 46:20.010
$50,000 for the website

46:20.013 --> 46:22.180
- and we'll pay your legal expenses.
- Hold on.

46:22.182 --> 46:23.510
You'd buy my website?

46:23.513 --> 46:25.469
Bot, app, all of it...

46:25.472 --> 46:28.515
and the copyright for your software.

46:28.518 --> 46:29.740
Which,

46:29.742 --> 46:33.047
by the way, because there'd
be lawyers operating it,

46:33.049 --> 46:34.663
would get around any future prosecution

46:34.666 --> 46:36.335
for practicing law without a license.

46:36.338 --> 46:37.877
Yeah,

46:37.880 --> 46:39.575
but how will you feel about letting go?

46:39.577 --> 46:43.362
Okay, look.

46:43.364 --> 46:46.278
Are you committed to
providing incarcerated people

46:46.280 --> 46:48.603
with the means for redress
of their grievances?

46:48.606 --> 46:50.765
This firm's been representing
incarcerated people

46:50.768 --> 46:52.719
- since its founding.
- Yeah, right.

46:52.721 --> 46:55.026
But are you committed
to maintaining my site

46:55.028 --> 46:57.780
so that incarcerated people
can represent themselves?

46:57.783 --> 46:59.378
No.

46:59.380 --> 47:02.381
Once we purchase it,
it will cease to exist.

47:03.863 --> 47:07.260
Oh, Mr. Boseman, he's
never gonna agree to that.

47:09.129 --> 47:10.302
Hmm.

47:10.304 --> 47:11.788
Yeah.

47:14.613 --> 47:16.191
Can you go to 100?

47:24.682 --> 47:26.894
Thank you.

47:26.897 --> 47:28.407
I don't know.

47:28.409 --> 47:30.061
Are you sure about this?

47:30.063 --> 47:34.108
No, but... it's money.

47:34.110 --> 47:37.459
And it'll help me start
the next thing, right?

47:37.461 --> 47:39.853
Yeah.

47:39.855 --> 47:41.550
Hey.

47:41.552 --> 47:43.465
Don't be a stranger.

47:43.467 --> 47:45.394
You either.

47:45.397 --> 47:49.672
Oh, and, uh, you want
to be the godfather?

47:51.763 --> 47:53.328
Fuck, yes.

47:53.331 --> 47:56.652
You tell me when.

47:56.654 --> 47:58.089
Hey. Bye.

48:04.020 --> 48:05.541
Want to play some?

48:07.100 --> 48:08.284
Yeah.

48:23.420 --> 48:24.724
Wait.

48:24.726 --> 48:26.204
W-W-Wait. Can you hold the door?

48:34.475 --> 48:36.257
Thanks.

48:38.740 --> 48:40.656
Hey, thanks for the eraser guy.

48:40.659 --> 48:42.439
No problem.

48:46.530 --> 48:48.313
Hey.

48:48.433 --> 48:51.011
Hey.

48:51.013 --> 48:54.623
I couldn't do another
horrible video thing

48:54.625 --> 48:56.355
or a cell phone call.

49:01.956 --> 49:05.086
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong?

49:05.089 --> 49:06.766
I'm just so sorry.

49:06.768 --> 49:09.581
For...?

49:11.468 --> 49:13.947
I'm afraid if I tell you,

49:13.949 --> 49:15.775
you won't want to see me again.

49:15.777 --> 49:19.431
I don't think that's possible.

49:19.433 --> 49:22.566
I think it is.

49:29.835 --> 49:32.096
Diane, what is it?

49:35.579 --> 49:38.104
I...

49:39.757 --> 49:42.106
I...

49:42.108 --> 49:44.378
I scheduled work this weekend.

49:44.381 --> 49:47.330
And I, I didn't think you would be here.

49:56.700 --> 49:57.961
It's okay.

49:57.964 --> 49:59.139
I'll see you tonight.

50:02.389 --> 50:04.128
I, uh...

50:04.130 --> 50:07.527
I just wanted to say

50:07.530 --> 50:09.948
I'm done with this separation.

50:12.180 --> 50:15.138
I think we should
move in together again.
