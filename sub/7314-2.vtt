Jimmy?

00:14.974 --> 00:18.008
Guys? You in there?

00:20.245 --> 00:22.295
Get it together, Abby.

00:22.297 --> 00:24.181
This is old news.

00:24.183 --> 00:26.350
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:26.352 --> 00:28.986
(sighs)

00:28.988 --> 00:29.987

00:29.989 --> 00:32.022
Ducky? Jimmy?

00:32.024 --> 00:35.125
Ducky? Jimmy? Guys?

00:35.127 --> 00:37.127
Oh, no. Not again.

00:37.129 --> 00:38.478

00:38.480 --> 00:40.814

Gibbs.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.134
3:00 in the morning, Abbs.

01:00.136 --> 01:02.019
I know.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.520
I'm sorry I woke you.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.839
You calling for the same reason?

01:05.841 --> 01:08.508
Yeah.

01:08.510 --> 01:10.165
It happened again.

01:45.214 --> 01:46.980
(imitating Cary Grant):
Judy! Judy! Judy!

01:46.982 --> 01:48.816
I've been thinking
about your position.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.551
How does one get to be a Navy
Facilities Manager anyway?

01:51.553 --> 01:55.388
Oh, same way one gets to be a
very special agent, I imagine.

01:55.390 --> 01:58.826
So, uh, good looks,
a nice smile, and a little luck?

01:58.828 --> 02:00.828
Uh, hard work, determination,

02:00.830 --> 02:03.947
and as for the luck,
I prefer to make my own.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.115
Amen to that, sister.

02:05.117 --> 02:06.250
Well, we've been very lucky

02:06.252 --> 02:08.418
to have you working
with the Seabees on this.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.037
The repairs look great.

02:10.038 --> 02:11.255
Oh, it's what we do.

02:11.257 --> 02:14.407
Fresh coat of paint, and
my work will be done here.

02:15.994 --> 02:17.911
Hey, listen, I-I just want
to take this opportunity

02:17.913 --> 02:19.379
to say that
not only are you

02:19.381 --> 02:21.581
great at your job--
clearly, you are--

02:21.583 --> 02:23.183
but you are also
the best-smelling,

02:23.185 --> 02:25.018
uh, Navy Facilities Manager
I've ever met.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.137
Uh, speaking of repairs,
brother...

02:27.139 --> 02:29.106
Were we?
Since it is not every day

02:29.108 --> 02:30.891
that our Navy Yard
gets blown up,

02:30.893 --> 02:32.893
does our office not deserve
a few improvements?

02:32.895 --> 02:34.278
Yeah, I wondered that, too.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.147
Seems like everything's going
back exactly the way it was.

02:37.149 --> 02:38.782
Same desks, same

02:38.784 --> 02:39.983
light fixtures.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.652
Would a different paint color
be too much to ask?

02:41.654 --> 02:43.620
(chuckling)

02:43.622 --> 02:45.155
Ease up, McDutch Boy.

02:45.157 --> 02:47.991
I think the goal here is
for things to get back

02:47.993 --> 02:49.109
to the way they were before.

02:49.111 --> 02:50.777
Uh, back to normal
as soon as possible.

02:50.779 --> 02:51.995
Those were my
marching orders.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.130
Marching orders.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.282
So if you've got
a complaint, I think

02:55.284 --> 02:57.467
maybe you should take it
to the big man upstairs.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.636
By that, I mean Vance,
not the <i>big,</i> big man.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.089
Uh-huh. Though I do
see your point, guys.

03:02.091 --> 03:03.257
Um,

03:03.259 --> 03:04.842
budget's tight,
but there may be

03:04.844 --> 03:06.459
some wiggle room
on paint color.

03:06.461 --> 03:08.512
Give me a few hours.
I'll see what I can do.

03:08.514 --> 03:11.348
Mm. Wiggle away.

03:11.350 --> 03:13.901
Seriously? McGee, paint?

03:13.903 --> 03:16.436
ZIVA: Seriously-- "best-smelling
Facilities Manager"?

03:16.438 --> 03:18.071
Well, she is.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.140
You've been after her
for weeks, Tony.

03:20.142 --> 03:22.442
Never seen you take so long
to close a deal.

03:22.444 --> 03:23.527
Rent a room already.

03:23.529 --> 03:25.312
TONY:
Get. It's <i>get</i> a room.

03:25.314 --> 03:27.915
And I would have already
if I didn't have

03:27.917 --> 03:29.867
two player-haters chiming in
from the cheap seats.

03:29.869 --> 03:32.035
Guess that would make you
DiNozzo, huh?

03:32.037 --> 03:34.504
Uh, the "spirited warrior"

03:34.506 --> 03:35.539
would be Agent David,

03:35.541 --> 03:38.625
and "pensive academic"
would be McGee.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.879
Oh, Dr. Cranston sent

03:41.881 --> 03:43.496
bullet-point descriptions
of each of you.

03:43.498 --> 03:44.932
Which would
make you...?

03:44.934 --> 03:47.000
Oh, forgive me.
Miles Wolf.

03:47.002 --> 03:48.352
Crisis counselor.

03:48.354 --> 03:49.937
Recent events have called

03:49.939 --> 03:51.555
for mandatory
psych evaluations.

03:51.557 --> 03:53.440
Uh, that's my specialty.

03:53.442 --> 03:57.060
And what tribal name did
Cranston use to describe me?

03:57.062 --> 03:59.529
All in due time,
but I look forward

03:59.531 --> 04:02.182
to speaking with each of you,
uh, quite soon.

04:02.184 --> 04:05.185
But right now, I'm running up
to see the big man upstairs,

04:05.187 --> 04:06.970
as you... as you
like to say.

04:06.972 --> 04:09.356
Tribal name.
Very good.

04:09.358 --> 04:10.958
(chuckles)
Very good.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.327
ZIVA: Just when I think
we're finally moving on,

04:13.329 --> 04:15.796
we're forced to have our heads
examined by Mr. Happy.

04:15.798 --> 04:16.997
TONY:
Be still, Warrior.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.048
It's not so bad.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.499
McGEE:
Yeah, not bad for you.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.201
You <i>like</i> talking
about yourself.

04:21.202 --> 04:23.536
That's because I have nothing
to hide, Pensive One.

04:23.538 --> 04:24.671
Besides,

04:24.673 --> 04:28.225
we're all perfectly fine,
aren't we?

04:28.227 --> 04:29.709
I'm good.

04:29.711 --> 04:31.561
Yeah.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.880
I'm perfect.

04:35.433 --> 04:36.716
The good news thus far,

04:36.718 --> 04:39.219
gentlemen, is that all
but a few NCIS personnel

04:39.221 --> 04:41.405
have survived the bombing and
are soldiering on, if you will.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.990
Does that include the Armory?

04:42.992 --> 04:44.574
Uh, no, Director.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.393
Those were the few
I was referring to.

04:46.395 --> 04:48.495
Your Armory is still suffering
over their missing

04:48.497 --> 04:50.580
co-worker, Ms.
Margaret Watkins.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.366
Midge.

04:52.368 --> 04:55.252
After four months,
there's still no sign of her

04:55.254 --> 04:57.337
since she evacuated
the day of the bombing.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.172
Oh, we hope
that's about to change.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.757
GIBBS:
I said maybe, Director.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.959
A car was found.

05:01.961 --> 05:03.794
We're not sure
if it's hers yet.

05:03.796 --> 05:04.911
Fingers crossed?

05:04.913 --> 05:06.430
Yes.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.299
Agent Gibbs, I have one unit
left to evaluate.

05:09.301 --> 05:11.601
Dr. Cranston suggested
I save yours till last.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.053
Uh, start with Sciuto.

05:13.055 --> 05:16.273
Sciuto. That would be
Miss Abigail Sciuto.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.025
"Gothic wildflower""
(phone ringing)

05:18.027 --> 05:20.427
Uh, anything you want
to tell me going in?

05:20.429 --> 05:22.112
Nightmares.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.264
Yeah. Gibbs.

05:24.266 --> 05:25.932
WOLF:
I shall be sure to review

05:25.934 --> 05:27.784
Ms. Sciuto's case file
before speaking with her.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.370
Divers matched the plate.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.406
Midge's car.

05:32.408 --> 05:33.957
Divers?

05:43.301 --> 05:45.335
ZIVA:
That is Midge.

05:45.337 --> 05:49.222
After all this time, I thought
she would look much worse.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.958
JIMMY: If you will kindly
make room, I will explain

05:51.960 --> 05:53.477
that bodies do not

05:53.479 --> 05:56.229
decay as quickly
in cool, fresh water.

05:56.231 --> 05:59.566
I think maybe
Jimmy's getting a little cocky

05:59.568 --> 06:01.518
in Ducky's
big-boy shoes.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.854
Oh, you-you guys,
am I coming across that way?

06:03.856 --> 06:06.106
I can certainly dial it back.
Do not dial a thing, Jimmy.

06:06.108 --> 06:07.324
You're coming off
just fine.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.910
GIBBS:
Talk to me, McGee.

06:09.912 --> 06:12.662
Apparently, this road's a
popular shortcut for the locals.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.647
Midge count as a local?

06:14.649 --> 06:16.666
Well, we're right
off the highway.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.818
She's three exits
south of here.

06:18.820 --> 06:21.505
Uh, victim is female,

06:21.507 --> 06:22.622
early 40s.

06:22.624 --> 06:23.790
Complexion
appears dark.

06:23.792 --> 06:25.008
ZIVA:
Dark?

06:25.010 --> 06:26.626
She was quite fair.

06:26.628 --> 06:29.012
Is it possible
this is not Midge?

06:29.014 --> 06:31.331
I wouldn't get
your hopes up, Agent David.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.182
Dr. Mallard!

06:32.184 --> 06:34.601
Hey, Ducky!

06:34.603 --> 06:36.436
Well, you look
wonderful.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.939
Why should now
be any different?

06:38.941 --> 06:41.508
As to Midge's complexion,

06:41.510 --> 06:43.894
surely Mr. Palmer
knows by now...

06:43.896 --> 06:45.529
Yeah, it's-it's silt.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.364
It's-it's pond silt.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.485
Good to see you, too, Jethro.

06:51.487 --> 06:53.070
What are you doing here, Duck?

06:53.072 --> 06:55.455
Well, when Mr. Palmer
called me to inform

06:55.457 --> 06:57.624
that one of our own
may have been found,

06:57.626 --> 06:59.192
how could I stay away?

06:59.194 --> 07:00.744
Well, how about
doctor's orders?

07:00.746 --> 07:02.129
No medical clearance?

07:02.131 --> 07:03.747
A mere formality.
(laughs)

07:03.749 --> 07:07.501
If I'm well enough
to swim and play golf,

07:07.503 --> 07:09.920
then, certainly, I'm
well enough to visit.

07:09.922 --> 07:11.805
TONY:
I found a photo ID, boss.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.323
It's Midge.

07:14.675 --> 07:17.427
Certainly not the happy ending
we were hoping for.

07:17.429 --> 07:19.563
TONY: Maybe she was speeding through
here after the evacuation,

07:19.565 --> 07:21.148
lost control of the car?

07:21.150 --> 07:23.883
Well, road's half-mud.
Makes sense.

07:23.885 --> 07:25.152
Does it?

07:25.154 --> 07:27.320
Missing Persons report
says she made it home that day.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.439
Something
doesn't add up.

07:29.441 --> 07:31.658
Yes, I would be
inclined to agree.

07:32.699 --> 07:36.568
JIMMY: Agent Gibbs, found a wound
in her abdomen.

07:36.570 --> 07:39.370
Looks like she's been shot.

07:48.341 --> 07:50.842
Well, divers have been
dredging the pond for hours.

07:50.844 --> 07:52.527
Still no gun.

07:52.529 --> 07:53.712
What's with him?

07:53.714 --> 07:55.046
Apparently, while
we were out,

07:55.048 --> 07:56.965
our friend Judy left
some paint-color samples

07:56.967 --> 07:58.300
for us to choose from.

07:58.302 --> 07:59.768
Ah.
Correction.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.187
<i>My</i> friend Judy left samples
on my desk

08:02.189 --> 08:05.473
with a delightfully fragrant
and provocative note.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.110
(sniffing)

08:09.112 --> 08:10.528
"See anything
you like""

08:10.530 --> 08:12.697
Obviously asking all of us.

08:12.699 --> 08:14.532
I'll give you
fragrant, Tony,

08:14.534 --> 08:16.368
but clearly, she's asking
about paint samples.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.569
(Ziva laughs)

08:17.571 --> 08:19.537
Clearly, she's asking
what I might like.

08:19.539 --> 08:20.906
Come on.

08:20.908 --> 08:23.124
You know what I'd like? McGee.

08:23.126 --> 08:24.409
TONY:
An update.

08:24.411 --> 08:26.294
(computer chirps)

08:26.296 --> 08:27.712
Midge Watkins, 43.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.748
Former enlisted,
retired Marine captain,

08:29.750 --> 08:32.082
serving as an NCIS
weapons administrator

08:32.085 --> 08:33.217
since '06.

08:33.220 --> 08:35.253
Widowed in '02,
with one child, Navy Ensign

08:35.255 --> 08:37.639
Grace Watkins,
stationed in San Diego.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.975
She been notified?
She's on a flight right now.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.259
McGEE:
Poor Midge.

08:41.260 --> 08:43.895
Everybody liked her.

08:43.897 --> 08:45.546
And she liked
everybody.

08:45.548 --> 08:46.598
Mostly.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.366
Mostly? Who
didn't she like?

08:49.568 --> 08:52.721
No one, Tony.
You were right.

08:52.723 --> 08:54.940
Oh, come on. Seriously.

08:54.942 --> 08:56.191
They're mostly-ing me?

08:56.193 --> 08:59.527
DiNozzo, take Ziva, go talk
to Midge's coworkers.

08:59.529 --> 09:00.996
McGee, work up a timeline

09:00.998 --> 09:03.348
of the last day Midge was seen alive.
On it, boss.

09:05.234 --> 09:07.335
Why didn't she like me?

09:07.337 --> 09:09.754
Let it go, Tony.
Come on. Let's go.

09:09.756 --> 09:11.172
Okay, play it coy.

09:11.174 --> 09:12.457
I'm fine with that.

09:12.459 --> 09:14.575
Seriously, why?

09:14.577 --> 09:18.179
As laboratories go,
this one's rather cozy.

09:18.181 --> 09:20.882
I'd been told the bombing
did extensive damage.

09:20.884 --> 09:24.386
Well, it's all put back
together now.

09:24.388 --> 09:26.721
And if it's all the same
to you, I'd rather not

09:26.723 --> 09:28.440
talk about the...

09:28.442 --> 09:31.726
The what? Bombing?

09:32.561 --> 09:34.612
Could you not lean there?

09:34.614 --> 09:37.232
Oh, sorry.
It a sensitive machine?

09:37.234 --> 09:39.234
It's not a machine.

09:39.236 --> 09:40.952
It's Major Mass Spec.

09:40.954 --> 09:44.439
And he hasn't completely
recovered yet from the...

09:44.441 --> 09:45.890
Bombing.

09:48.610 --> 09:50.378
Look, can we do this
another time?

09:50.380 --> 09:52.130
'Cause this thing
with the Armory lady

09:52.132 --> 09:54.299
has got me not
feeling so great.

09:54.301 --> 09:55.616
Oh, was she a friend?

09:55.618 --> 09:58.786
No. Just, after the, well...

09:58.788 --> 10:00.338
Bombing.

10:00.340 --> 10:03.308
...I was just really hoping
that she would turn up alive.

10:03.310 --> 10:05.393
We all were.

10:05.395 --> 10:07.595
I wonder if, um,

10:07.597 --> 10:10.631
we might discuss
those recurring nightmares

10:10.633 --> 10:12.800
that you suffered
a few years back?

10:14.570 --> 10:17.689
You know, it's not uncommon for

10:17.691 --> 10:21.643
old neuroses to return
after a major traumatic event.

10:22.205 --> 10:25.940
So... have they?

10:27.759 --> 10:30.177
What if they have?

10:30.179 --> 10:32.546
Well, these dreams
where you see yourself

10:32.548 --> 10:35.049
lying dead in Autopsy--

10:35.051 --> 10:38.402
how does that image
make you feel?

10:38.404 --> 10:40.220
I can't.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.023
Yes, you can, Abby.

10:42.025 --> 10:44.558
Trust yourself.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.411
No. Look, you seem like

10:47.413 --> 10:51.065
a really nice man,
Dr. Wolf, but...

10:52.233 --> 10:54.619
...I can't go there. I won't.

10:54.621 --> 10:58.706
Well, can't and won't
are no match for can and will.

10:58.708 --> 11:02.677
And if you will talk to
me, Abby, perhaps I can

11:02.679 --> 11:06.514
stop sounding like
a greeting card.

11:06.516 --> 11:08.716
What do you say?

11:08.718 --> 11:11.469
I say can't.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.253
Won't.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.972
I'm not going there.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.974
Not to how it makes me feel,

11:16.976 --> 11:21.228
and I am certainly
not going back to Autopsy.

11:24.282 --> 11:26.450
(beeping, hiss)

11:28.487 --> 11:31.405
(bell dings)
Talk to me.

11:31.407 --> 11:32.907
DUCKY:
Ah,

11:32.909 --> 11:34.291
Jethro, we've only
just finished

11:34.293 --> 11:35.609
the x-rays.

11:37.629 --> 11:39.130
(sighs)

11:39.132 --> 11:41.298
Old habits die hard.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.633
Mr. Palmer?

11:42.635 --> 11:45.002
So do old doctors, apparently.

11:45.637 --> 11:46.954
(laughs)

11:48.674 --> 11:51.175
I said that
because he almost died.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.795
Sorry about that.
(clears throat)

11:54.797 --> 11:56.313
Agent Gibbs,
despite the decomp,

11:56.315 --> 11:57.682
I noticed
some defensive bruising

11:57.684 --> 11:59.734
which indicated that Midge
put up quite a fight

11:59.736 --> 12:00.851
before she was shot.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.069
You got a bullet?

12:02.071 --> 12:03.137
Not on the x-ray.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.655
But although there
is an exit wound

12:04.657 --> 12:06.407
on her back,
so whatever hit

12:06.409 --> 12:07.525
went through and through.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.694
I suggest you swab
the entry wound for...

12:09.696 --> 12:10.945
Gunshot residue?

12:10.947 --> 12:13.147
Yeah, Abby's running
the samples now.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.416
Go home, Ducky.

12:15.418 --> 12:18.536
I am bored to tears at home.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.870
Well, then read a book.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.872
Hell, write a book.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.490
You need medical clearance.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.675
I'm clearly

12:24.677 --> 12:25.960
well enough to work.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.429
Until I hear that
from a doctor not named Mallard,

12:28.431 --> 12:29.997
(bell dings)
I want you resting.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.000
Doc, look,

12:33.002 --> 12:34.685
if something comes up
and the kid gets stuck,

12:34.687 --> 12:35.886
I'll call you.
You know I will.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.221
All right, I'll leave,

12:37.223 --> 12:38.556
but not happily, I assure you.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.174
I don't need you happy.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.809
I need you healthy.

12:46.948 --> 12:48.699
MAN:
I can't believe Midge is gone.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.034
ZIVA:
Could you recount for us

12:50.036 --> 12:51.685
the last time
you both saw her?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.988
Sure, it was the day
of the bombing.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.623
I was on P229s.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.408
Midge was handling
the new Cheytac M200s.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.360
Actually, I handled
the M200s.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.997
Pretty sure you had the HK45Cs.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.082
No, Midge had finished
the HK45Cs.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.584
I had the P229s and...

13:06.586 --> 13:08.702
(gun clicks)
ZIVA: I'm sorry.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.921
Could you be less specific?

13:10.923 --> 13:14.141
Start with the evacuation.

13:14.143 --> 13:16.093
Not much to tell.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.678
I got out quick.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.064
Yeah, we let Phyllis
and the others go,

13:20.066 --> 13:21.381
and Midge and I stayed behind

13:21.383 --> 13:22.716
to secure munitions.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.401
You hear "bomb scare"

13:24.403 --> 13:26.437
and never really think
one's gonna go off.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.439
Well, one did.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.724
Yeah, we still have
the bullet holes.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.661
Set off a whole
chain reaction.

13:33.663 --> 13:35.079
Boom, bang.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.415
Bullets,
shrapnel flying everywhere.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.951
Oh, look here.

13:42.287 --> 13:45.005
I didn't even know I was hit
until I was halfway home.

13:45.007 --> 13:47.124
Took a dozen
stitches at the ER.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.626
Few inches left,
and you would've needed

13:48.628 --> 13:50.044
a lot more than stitches.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.296
Is it possible
that Midge was hit?

13:52.298 --> 13:53.881
I don't think so.

13:53.883 --> 13:56.750
We both got in our cars and
drove off at the same time.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.886
Who knows?

13:58.888 --> 14:00.654
We were all pretty out of it.

14:03.692 --> 14:06.527
Are you saying Midge
didn't know she'd been hit?

14:06.529 --> 14:08.362
We're saying
it's a possibility.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.064
A bullet,
a piece of shrapnel.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.982
You know of cases
where victims are in shock.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.234
Like McGee, for example,

14:13.236 --> 14:15.202
with a shard
of glass in his side.

14:15.204 --> 14:17.905
Get a list of all the ammo
that went off in the armory.

14:17.907 --> 14:19.106
See what might have hit Midge.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.407
See if we can match
it to her wound.

14:20.409 --> 14:21.458
Mm-hmm.
Good news.

14:21.460 --> 14:22.660
I'm mentally stable.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.911
Almost disturbingly so.

14:23.913 --> 14:25.129
Uh, who's next?

14:25.131 --> 14:26.964
Rock, paper, scissors?
Mm-hmm.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.133
I always win.
How'd it go with Abby?

14:30.135 --> 14:31.785
It didn't.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.438
I'm afraid I found her
to be rather, uh...

14:35.674 --> 14:37.141
...uncooperative.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.726
(elevator bell dings)

14:38.728 --> 14:40.561
(elevator doors slide open)

14:40.563 --> 14:41.679
Hey, Gibbs.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.847
I was just about
to call you.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.014
Yeah, I'll bet.

14:44.016 --> 14:47.301
Um, there are epinephrine
pens in the glove box.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.652
Midge's medical file
indicates

14:48.654 --> 14:50.487
that she had some
pretty severe allergies.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.856
What about the weapon?

14:51.858 --> 14:53.190
Fully loaded .22

14:53.192 --> 14:54.158
under the seat.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.526
She never got
to use it.

14:57.913 --> 15:00.114
What's going on
with you and the shrink?

15:00.116 --> 15:02.299
I'm sorry?

15:03.702 --> 15:06.170
Abbs, got to do something
about these nightmares.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.988
I can't talk to strangers
about it, Gibbs.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.323
Well...

15:09.325 --> 15:11.658
it's going to be Wolf or me.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.327
You?

15:13.329 --> 15:15.262
Well, yeah,
if it means one of us

15:15.264 --> 15:17.664
getting a full night's sleep.

15:18.967 --> 15:20.384
I mean,

15:20.386 --> 15:23.888
as long as we keep it short.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.723
Nothing...

15:25.725 --> 15:28.275
too deep.

15:28.277 --> 15:32.980
See, this is why
I got so freaked out

15:32.982 --> 15:34.982
after what happened
that day.

15:34.984 --> 15:38.185
You know, not knowing
if I'd lost my best friends.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.737
You didn't lose any of us.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.688
Yeah, but it triggered
something, Gibbs,

15:41.690 --> 15:43.523
and now I keep thinking

15:43.525 --> 15:47.544
about what Dr. Wolf
was saying about my dreams.

15:47.546 --> 15:50.831
You know, that... that image
of me lying dead on...

15:50.833 --> 15:54.218
on the autopsy table and...
and how that makes me feel.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.719
Abbs.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.355
Nothing too deep, remember?

15:59.841 --> 16:02.726
Alone, Gibbs.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.062
It makes me feel alone.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.214
Like I've got nobody.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.732
No family.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.936
Just... no one.

16:14.906 --> 16:16.824
You talk to your brother lately?

16:16.826 --> 16:19.493
No, I don't talk to him
about stuff like this.

16:19.495 --> 16:20.995
Plus Luca's really busy.

16:20.997 --> 16:22.363
I don't want to bother him.

16:22.365 --> 16:25.115
What about the other one?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.834
My biological brother?

16:26.836 --> 16:28.352
Kyle?

16:30.755 --> 16:32.756
He doesn't even know I exist.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.091
Well...

16:34.093 --> 16:36.176
maybe he should, Abbs.

16:36.178 --> 16:38.295
I only met him
once, Gibbs.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.747
I didn't actually meet him,

16:40.749 --> 16:44.134
'cause I didn't have
the guts to...

16:44.136 --> 16:46.420
Guts to do what, Abbs?

16:46.422 --> 16:48.355
Abbs?

16:49.224 --> 16:50.441
Bullet.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.560
Oh. Wasn't shrapnel
from the armory.

16:53.562 --> 16:56.096
Nope.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.065
Midge was shot at
point-blank range

16:58.067 --> 16:59.766
right here in the car.

17:08.789 --> 17:12.397
I was in San Diego, coming
off six months at sea,

17:12.398 --> 17:14.449
when word came in
about the explosion.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.184
Did you speak to your mother?

17:16.185 --> 17:17.569
We texted.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.204
She said she'd
gotten home okay

17:19.205 --> 17:21.271
and she'd call me
after she showered.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.906
She never called back.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.998
We searched all summer.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.533
It was like she fell
off the planet.

17:32.535 --> 17:35.003
I only went back on duty
last week.

17:35.005 --> 17:37.538
My mom would have wanted me to.

17:44.546 --> 17:47.599
I hate to ask this, Grace,
but, um,

17:47.601 --> 17:49.384
did your mother
have any enemies?

17:49.386 --> 17:50.685
What do you mean?

17:50.687 --> 17:52.871
Wasn't the crash
an accident?

17:54.056 --> 17:55.824
Sit down.

18:00.396 --> 18:01.830
Your mother was shot.

18:02.865 --> 18:04.916
It was not a robbery.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.868
That's why it's
so important for us

18:06.870 --> 18:09.404
to know if she had
any bad relationships.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.673
There were none.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.877
Everybody loved my mom.

18:15.879 --> 18:19.080
She had a special way
with people.

18:19.082 --> 18:21.766
Yes, she did.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.635
You knew her well?

18:24.754 --> 18:27.272
Your mother was always...

18:27.274 --> 18:29.774
very supportive
of female agents.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.611
Never failed to make me feel
as though she had my back.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.197
I appreciated that.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.118
I'm not surprised.

18:40.120 --> 18:45.540
She was a big believer
in women supporting women.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.459
Especially in the workplace.

18:47.461 --> 18:50.378
Almost to a
fault sometimes.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.130
To a fault?

18:52.132 --> 18:57.252
Just the typical male grumbling
about playing favorites.

18:57.254 --> 19:00.438
Not that she ever
let it bother her.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.225
You can't tell me
Midge didn't like me

19:04.227 --> 19:05.460
because I'm not a woman.

19:05.462 --> 19:07.262
Let it go, Tony.
Midge liked you just fine.

19:07.264 --> 19:11.299
She just thought you were
occasionally annoying.

19:11.301 --> 19:12.567
Annoying?

19:12.569 --> 19:13.902
That's almost worse.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.153
McGEE: You're more like
high-maintenance.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.472
You know, always switching
from the hip holster

19:17.474 --> 19:18.940
to the shoulder
to the ankle.

19:18.942 --> 19:21.159
ZIVA: Changing from
the Glock 17 to the 23

19:21.161 --> 19:22.360
and then back again.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.745
What's high-maintenance
about that?

19:23.747 --> 19:25.029
I like a certain holster.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.364
I like a certain gun.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.333
How about a certain paint?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.451
Oh, Judy.

19:29.453 --> 19:32.086
Um, got your samples right here.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.338
Also got your note.
Thank you.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.156
ZIVA: And we have
all checked off

19:35.158 --> 19:36.674
our color preferences.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.659
JUDY:
Well, here's the thing.

19:38.661 --> 19:40.628
Uh, I'm afraid I can't
deliver what I promised.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.764
Request was denied,
and it seems

19:42.766 --> 19:44.732
the big man wants
to keep the colors

19:44.734 --> 19:46.434
the same as they
were before.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.669
What is up with Vance?

19:48.671 --> 19:50.939
So, again, I'm
really sorry, guys.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.690
We appreciate you trying.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.858
Yeah.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.276
Oh, hey, Judy.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.013
We've gotten used to the orange.
It's quite all right.

19:59.015 --> 20:00.448
Although I understand
your disappointment.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.117
Maybe we could commiserate
over dinner tonight.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.852
Tonight?

20:04.854 --> 20:06.371
Yeah.
Oh, uh...

20:06.373 --> 20:07.989
I have plans.

20:07.991 --> 20:09.374
Oh, that's a shame.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.125
How about this?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.243
What night's good for you?

20:12.245 --> 20:13.294
Any night.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.129
(sighs)

20:15.131 --> 20:17.031
Can't believe I have
to shoot you down

20:17.033 --> 20:18.716
twice in a row.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.802
Shoot... shoot me down?

20:20.804 --> 20:22.387
Uh, well, dinner

20:22.389 --> 20:24.872
is something else
that I can't deliver.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.059
I'm spoken for.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.979
Yeah, I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.981
I thought you and I
were kind of...

20:32.983 --> 20:34.098
sport-flirting.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.400
You know, for fun.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.884
Sport-flirting?

20:36.886 --> 20:38.052
Yeah.

20:38.054 --> 20:39.604
Sorry.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.023
Hey.

20:42.025 --> 20:43.825
It was fun.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.737
You okay, Tony?

20:56.739 --> 20:57.922
(smacks lips)

20:57.924 --> 20:59.841
She smelled awful nice.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.343
VANCE: I want answers
for Midge, Gibbs.

21:02.345 --> 21:03.911
This trail
is cold enough as it is.

21:03.913 --> 21:05.213
We need to step up
our efforts.

21:05.215 --> 21:06.431
We're doing all
we can, Leon.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.600
Reviewing witness statements
as we speak, boss.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.301
Tony and I are looking
into potential enemies.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.853
WOLF: And just a few
more evaluations

21:11.855 --> 21:13.304
on my docket, Director.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.439
Oh, Tony,

21:14.441 --> 21:16.441
did you tell everyone
your tribal name?

21:16.443 --> 21:17.475
Tribal name?

21:17.477 --> 21:18.759
Brilliant Chatterbox.

21:18.761 --> 21:21.479
You see, Dr. Cranston described...
Enough!

21:23.649 --> 21:26.367
Finish your job, Wolf,

21:26.369 --> 21:28.152
and you let my agents
finish theirs.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.606
One of our own is dead,

21:31.608 --> 21:35.109
and I want her
killer caught.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.414
With no chatterboxing.

21:39.416 --> 21:41.115
Yes, sir.

21:41.117 --> 21:42.634
Nice, Wolfie.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.168
Neglecting to check

21:44.170 --> 21:46.137
the temperature of the room
before speaking--

21:46.139 --> 21:48.723
it's, uh, always been
a bit of a shortcoming.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.458
But only two to go.

21:50.460 --> 21:51.976
Agent Gibbs?

21:53.629 --> 21:55.313
Ziva, go.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.732
It'll have to wait, Gibbs.
I think I'm on to something.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.017
Okay, then put it up.

21:59.019 --> 22:01.152
ZIVA:
According

22:01.154 --> 22:02.687
to personal records,
Midge hired Phyllis Moss

22:02.689 --> 22:04.022
last year

22:04.024 --> 22:05.990
over the objections
of this man,

22:05.992 --> 22:08.843
fellow job applicant
Craig Wilson.

22:08.845 --> 22:10.828
He is former Air Force.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.812
McGee...

22:11.814 --> 22:12.980
Deep background, boss.

22:12.982 --> 22:14.666
ZIVA:
Wilson filed a bias suit,

22:14.668 --> 22:16.084
claiming that Midge
denied him employment

22:16.086 --> 22:18.870
on the sole basis of gender,
but the grievance

22:18.872 --> 22:21.122
was thrown out by a review board

22:21.124 --> 22:22.790
just five months ago.

22:22.792 --> 22:24.992
That's around the time of the bombing.
Hell of a coincidence.

22:24.994 --> 22:26.010
McGEE:
Here we go.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.296
Staff Sergeant
Craig Wilson, 38.

22:28.298 --> 22:30.831
Reprimanded twice for fighting
while on active duty.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.383
Discharged for
bad conduct in '07.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.602
Currently unemployed.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.355
Out of work and out for revenge?
Go on. Take Ziva. Get him.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.190
WOLF:
Very exciting.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.775
Shall we?

22:44.680 --> 22:47.532
Okay.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.684
WOLF: Dr. Cranston used
many words

22:49.686 --> 22:52.036
to describe you, Agent Gibbs.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.154
Most in the...

22:53.156 --> 22:55.540
"tough nut to crack"
category.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.242
What say we
prove her wrong?

22:58.244 --> 22:59.961
You're the doc, Doc.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.862
Indeed.

23:01.864 --> 23:05.550
So if you would kindly begin

23:05.552 --> 23:07.385
by telling me where you were

23:07.387 --> 23:09.504
when the bomb first exploded.

23:09.506 --> 23:11.889
Would having
family around help?

23:11.891 --> 23:14.425
I'm, I'm sorry.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.593
Uh, your family?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.178
Abby's.

23:17.180 --> 23:18.629
You asked her
about her dreams.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.798
She says they make her
feel alone.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.550
Would family help?

23:22.552 --> 23:24.652
I'm sorry.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.504
You are aware that
this is your evaluation

23:26.506 --> 23:28.990
and not...

23:28.992 --> 23:31.793
Yes, yes, it might,

23:31.795 --> 23:34.195
but only if family is
proved to be the root

23:34.197 --> 23:36.230
of Abby's neurosis, and that
could take weeks of therapy

23:36.232 --> 23:38.449
to discern.
I don't have much time.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.501
(phone rings)

23:42.254 --> 23:45.123
Hey, Abby. Yeah.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.907
Yeah, I'll be right down.

23:46.909 --> 23:48.075
Duty calls.

23:48.077 --> 23:49.510
But we've yet to even begin...
Doc...

23:49.512 --> 23:51.412
I'll be back. I got another
question I want to ask you.

23:51.414 --> 23:53.631
But that was a
great talk, Wolf.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.417
I feel better already.

23:56.419 --> 23:57.935
Thanks.
(door closes)

23:57.937 --> 24:00.521
Not at all.

24:00.523 --> 24:03.057
Something's odd, Abbs?

24:03.059 --> 24:06.227
What's odd?
The bullet that killed Midge.

24:06.229 --> 24:08.446
It's nasty.
It's, like,

24:08.448 --> 24:11.932
way nastier than any
standard .32 I've ever seen.

24:11.934 --> 24:13.568
Looks pretty
standard to me.

24:13.570 --> 24:15.069
Yeah, well, look closer.

24:15.071 --> 24:17.205
It's covered in mold spores,

24:17.207 --> 24:19.440
and old mold,
like 60 years,

24:19.442 --> 24:22.543
which means it's
a very old bullet.

24:22.545 --> 24:23.795
From where?

24:23.797 --> 24:27.782
Well, my first thought
is this assassin...

24:27.784 --> 24:29.967
from the past-- he stumbles

24:29.969 --> 24:32.837
through a tear
in the space-time continuum...

24:32.839 --> 24:34.005
Or...

24:34.007 --> 24:35.473
from somebody's very old gun?

24:35.475 --> 24:37.141
That was my second thought.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.977
Here's a list
of possibilities.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.129
It's just gonna take me
a while to...

24:42.131 --> 24:43.598
(yawns)

24:43.600 --> 24:45.316
...to narrow it down.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.967
You want to take a nap?

24:46.969 --> 24:48.853
In my dreams.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.105
Oh... not my dreams.

24:51.107 --> 24:53.024
That's why I can't sleep
to begin with.

24:53.026 --> 24:55.193
Why don't you do
something about it?

24:55.195 --> 24:56.327
I am, Gibbs. I...

24:56.329 --> 24:59.530
avoided Autopsy
for a really long time,

24:59.532 --> 25:02.250
and I can do that again...
Not talking about Autopsy, Abbs.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.534
I'm talking about your brother.

25:04.419 --> 25:08.039
Your other brother, Abby.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.826
What?

25:11.828 --> 25:13.094
How could it hurt?

25:13.096 --> 25:15.329
Lots of ways.

25:15.331 --> 25:18.216
Maybe Kyle doesn't know...

25:18.218 --> 25:19.667
he's adopted.

25:19.669 --> 25:22.103
Or what if
he's not ready

25:22.105 --> 25:23.805
to meet his sister?

25:23.807 --> 25:27.275
And what if he doesn't like me?
(laughs): Right.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.526
Like that's even possible.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.895
Come on.

25:34.149 --> 25:36.117
A 60-year-old bullet.

25:36.119 --> 25:39.036
Abby must be in her glory.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.205
And you've barely spoken

25:41.207 --> 25:43.190
since we left,
Brilliant Chatterbox.

25:43.192 --> 25:45.743
Not feeling so
brilliant, I guess.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.378
ZIVA:
Well, if it is any consolation,

25:47.380 --> 25:49.080
your friend Judy
did not seem the least bit

25:49.082 --> 25:51.332
spoken for to me either.

25:51.334 --> 25:53.033
She's just a symptom.

25:53.035 --> 25:55.503
Vance was right to yell.

25:55.505 --> 25:57.588
I'm off my game.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.841
I've lost my focus.

25:59.843 --> 26:02.877
It's like half my brain is
still stuck in that elevator.

26:02.879 --> 26:05.396
And did you share this
with the Wolf?

26:05.398 --> 26:07.565
TONY:
What, and prove my tribal name?

26:07.567 --> 26:09.267
ZIVA:
That's a silly question.

26:09.269 --> 26:11.686
(door opens)

26:15.223 --> 26:16.524
Craig Wilson?

26:16.526 --> 26:18.492
Depends who's asking.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.060
NCIS. We'd like
to ask you just...

26:20.062 --> 26:21.612
I hate when they run.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.583
Come here!

26:27.586 --> 26:29.503
(grunts)

26:30.539 --> 26:31.756
I could've warned you
against that.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.841
ZIVA:
Tony?

26:35.010 --> 26:36.878
That's not what it looks like.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.213
Few things are.

26:45.579 --> 26:47.163
My guns are licensed.

26:47.165 --> 26:49.332
I was only heading out
to sell them.

26:49.334 --> 26:51.000
Things are a little
tight right now.

26:51.002 --> 26:52.068
Gonna get a whole lot tighter

26:52.070 --> 26:53.286
if one of them
killed Midge Watkins.

26:53.288 --> 26:54.504
Just my luck.

26:54.506 --> 26:56.122
I get in a beef with some broad

26:56.124 --> 26:57.206
and she turns up dead.

26:57.208 --> 27:01.127
Excuse me.
Make that "some lady""

27:01.129 --> 27:02.845
Or would you prefer woman?

27:02.847 --> 27:04.130
You know what I would prefer?

27:04.132 --> 27:07.133
I would prefer you not wearing
so much cheap cologne.

27:07.135 --> 27:08.551
Well, guy on the go,
you know,

27:08.553 --> 27:10.720
doesn't have much
time for showers.

27:10.722 --> 27:13.856
In fact, Midge, Midge
didn't like that either.

27:13.858 --> 27:17.560
She didn't like you a lot,

27:17.562 --> 27:19.712
according to her notes
from your interview.

27:19.714 --> 27:21.214
My interview?
Hmm.

27:21.216 --> 27:24.817
Hmm. Yeah, I knew that was over
before it started.

27:24.819 --> 27:27.553
I was sporting
the wrong sex organs that day.

27:27.555 --> 27:29.072
ZIVA:
Well, it seems to me,

27:29.074 --> 27:32.041
the person who got the job over
you was just more qualified.

27:32.043 --> 27:33.910
Here we go. Typical feminazing,

27:33.912 --> 27:35.712
blindly defending
her own.

27:35.714 --> 27:36.963
Excuse me?

27:36.965 --> 27:38.748
You heard me.

27:38.750 --> 27:41.450
TONY: You may not have noticed,
pal, but that's not

27:41.452 --> 27:43.670
a swastika hanging
around my partner's neck.

27:43.672 --> 27:46.005
Wow.

27:46.007 --> 27:48.091
Talk about déjà vu.

27:48.093 --> 27:50.593
I mean, it's like
the same interview...

27:50.595 --> 27:53.096
right down to
the whipped boyfriend.

27:53.098 --> 27:54.130
Whipped?

27:54.132 --> 27:56.332
Boyfriend?
Oh, yeah.

27:56.334 --> 27:58.851
The lovesick puppy that was

27:58.853 --> 28:02.689
hanging all over Midge
and her every word.

28:02.691 --> 28:04.006
Oh yeah, she had, she had

28:04.008 --> 28:05.575
that guy wrapped up

28:05.577 --> 28:06.909
big time.

28:06.911 --> 28:09.028
I can understand why
she didn't hire this clown.

28:09.030 --> 28:11.581
Ballistics report
came back negative.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.616
Midge wasn't shot
by any of the guns

28:13.618 --> 28:15.201
that this guy had on him.

28:15.203 --> 28:17.787
That doesn't mean a damn thing.
He could've used another gun.

28:17.789 --> 28:19.005
Don't worry about it, Leon.

28:19.007 --> 28:20.322
We're not gonna
cut him loose yet.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.675
ABBY: Um, these are the weapons
most likely used.

28:22.677 --> 28:25.211
There's two old
and one new,

28:25.213 --> 28:28.464
all capable of
firing a moldy .32.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.384
Have McGee start a search.

28:31.386 --> 28:33.269
Will do.

28:33.271 --> 28:36.272
Oh, and, um, if anybody
needs me for anything,

28:36.274 --> 28:37.390
I'll be on my cell.

28:37.392 --> 28:39.692
I have a, uh,

28:39.694 --> 28:41.778
family matter to attend to.

28:41.780 --> 28:44.731
(phone rings)

28:44.733 --> 28:46.983
A family matter?

28:46.985 --> 28:50.052
Hey, Palmer.

28:50.054 --> 28:51.904
Yeah.

28:51.906 --> 28:53.239
So the water
in Midge's lungs

28:53.241 --> 28:54.574
indicates that she
was still breathing

28:54.576 --> 28:56.358
when her car
hit the pond.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.626
Meaning that she was
likely shot just moments before.

28:58.651 --> 28:59.763
Doesn't change much.

28:59.764 --> 29:03.883
No, but these lesions
in her trachea might.

29:03.885 --> 29:05.501
So we know she was
highly allergic,

29:05.503 --> 29:07.804
but what could cause
this kind of reaction?

29:07.806 --> 29:09.555
I really can't even say.

29:09.557 --> 29:11.841
Keep working on her.
No.

29:11.843 --> 29:13.843
I mean, yes, I will.

29:13.845 --> 29:16.763
Um, what I mean to say is, um,

29:16.765 --> 29:18.731
this is hard to admit...

29:18.733 --> 29:20.566
Uh...
Jeez, Palmer, spit it out.

29:20.568 --> 29:24.237
I couldn't help but overhear
what you said to Dr. Mallard

29:24.239 --> 29:25.438
about giving him call

29:25.440 --> 29:26.989
if I got stuck.
Are you stuck?

29:26.991 --> 29:27.907
Quicksand.

29:27.909 --> 29:31.360
(dials phone)
(phone rings)

29:31.362 --> 29:33.279
Strictly brain work.

29:34.364 --> 29:36.866
All brains, no brawn.
I promise.

29:38.952 --> 29:40.503
Mallard.

29:40.505 --> 29:41.838
Seriously?

29:41.840 --> 29:44.123
Mr. Gender Bias said
I was Midge's boyfriend?

29:44.125 --> 29:45.424
Jon's got a girlfriend.

29:45.426 --> 29:47.243
Can you imagine
if we'd hired that jerk?

29:47.245 --> 29:49.545
Trusting him to do what
Phyllis is doing now?

29:50.447 --> 29:51.681
No, thanks.

29:51.683 --> 29:53.549
So never anything between you?

29:53.551 --> 29:55.551
Well...

29:55.553 --> 29:59.021
I can't say never. We did kind
of have a fling a while back.

29:59.023 --> 30:00.389
PHYLLIS:
A fling?

30:00.391 --> 30:01.941
No way.

30:01.943 --> 30:03.392
It was years ago. No big deal.

30:03.394 --> 30:04.777
How many years?

30:04.779 --> 30:06.562
Right after she lost
her husband.

30:06.564 --> 30:08.898
Just a mutual moment
of weakness.

30:08.900 --> 30:11.400
I could picture that.
JON: No, you couldn't, Phyllis,

30:11.402 --> 30:13.986
and neither could we.

30:13.988 --> 30:16.489
Believe me, Midge
deserved someone special,

30:16.491 --> 30:18.875
but we knew we were
better as friends.

30:18.877 --> 30:21.577
ZIVA: That brings up
another reason we're here.

30:21.579 --> 30:24.413
Do you happen to know
anything about these guns?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.417
PHYLLIS:
Wow.

30:28.419 --> 30:31.453
Couple of classics.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.973
Nothing like that
in stock here.

30:33.975 --> 30:36.225
Not in a long time anyway.

30:36.227 --> 30:38.010
You thinking one of these
killed Midge?

30:38.012 --> 30:39.512
TONY:
Well, if it fired an old

30:39.514 --> 30:41.463
.32 round, yeah,
it might have.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.684
Do you know of any collectors
or dealers who might know more?

30:44.686 --> 30:46.135
Yeah, I know a few.

30:46.137 --> 30:47.520
I can e-mail you their numbers.

30:47.522 --> 30:48.637
JON:
I'll be glad to call

30:48.639 --> 30:50.439
around myself,
if it's any help.

30:50.441 --> 30:52.525
That wouldn't hurt.

31:01.585 --> 31:03.736
(doorbell rings)

31:03.738 --> 31:05.838
Be right with you.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.790
No rush.

31:11.545 --> 31:14.714
Um, I was...

31:14.716 --> 31:17.350
Sorry. How can I help you?

31:17.352 --> 31:19.385
Oh, you're not...

31:19.387 --> 31:21.687
I, I don't...

31:21.689 --> 31:24.140
I changed my mind.

31:24.142 --> 31:25.558
(doorbell rings)

31:25.560 --> 31:26.842
Just take it as a sign, Abby.

31:26.844 --> 31:28.477
You waited too long.
It wasn't meant to be.

31:28.479 --> 31:30.897
He has his life; you have...
MAN: Excuse me, miss.

31:30.899 --> 31:32.698
Wait, wait, wait.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.017
I thought that was you.

31:35.019 --> 31:36.652
Didn't you come
in the shop before?

31:36.654 --> 31:38.237
A while back?

31:38.239 --> 31:41.190
Last year. You remember that?

31:41.192 --> 31:43.409
Yeah, like,
like it was yesterday.

31:43.411 --> 31:46.662
That sounded weird, didn't it?

31:46.664 --> 31:47.880
Not at all, no.

31:47.882 --> 31:49.916
I just didn't know
if I was gonna see you again.

31:49.918 --> 31:51.918
I had no way to find you.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.471
Why would you want to find me?

31:55.473 --> 31:58.257
I don't mean this
in a creepy way,

31:58.259 --> 31:59.809
but ever since you came in,

31:59.811 --> 32:03.429
I can't shake the feeling
that, that we had a connection

32:03.431 --> 32:06.933
or something.
I, I don't know why.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.570
I do.

32:11.572 --> 32:14.657
I know why.

32:22.782 --> 32:23.981
Wasn't easy to ask Gibbs

32:23.983 --> 32:25.616
to call you in,
Dr. Mallard.

32:25.618 --> 32:27.485
No time for pride,
Mr. Palmer.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.488
Identifying these lesions
is all that matters.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.123
I told you about
her allergies.

32:32.125 --> 32:34.041
Yes, you did, and
by the look of this,

32:34.043 --> 32:36.460
I'd say that Midge
was on the brink

32:36.462 --> 32:38.362
of full-blown anaphylaxis
when she died.

32:38.364 --> 32:39.630
That's what I thought.

32:39.632 --> 32:41.749
I just have no idea
what could have caused it.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.552
Yes, well, let's
swab some samples.

32:46.588 --> 32:48.205
McGee, put up our timeline.

32:48.207 --> 32:50.224
TONY: Uh, I got
it here, boss.

32:50.226 --> 32:53.210
May 15, the bomb
went off at 3:16 p.m.

32:53.212 --> 32:55.529
Coworker Jon Phelps
says Midge drove away

32:55.531 --> 32:57.381
uninjured at
about 3:45.

32:57.383 --> 32:59.316
ZIVA: She exchanged
text messages

32:59.318 --> 33:01.552
with her daughter Grace at 4:56,

33:01.554 --> 33:03.887
saying that she'd call
after a shower.

33:03.889 --> 33:05.272
The call never came.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.658
TONY: Leading us to believe
that Midge left willingly,

33:07.660 --> 33:09.944
or was forced away at gunpoint.

33:09.946 --> 33:13.080
And made to drive to the pond,
where she was shot in the car.

33:15.117 --> 33:18.119
Does that timing seem
odd to you, Gibbs?

33:18.121 --> 33:19.587
Bomb goes off at the Navy Yard,
someone decides

33:19.589 --> 33:21.122
it's a good time
to pull off a murder?

33:21.124 --> 33:22.373
Crime of opportunity?

33:22.375 --> 33:24.341
Hoping to make it
look like an accident,

33:24.343 --> 33:25.576
a result of the bombing.

33:25.578 --> 33:26.961
Midge puts
up a fight;

33:26.963 --> 33:29.046
she takes a bullet,
no more accident.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.464
Still no leads on the gun.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.550
That may have
just changed, Tony.

33:32.552 --> 33:33.684
GIBBS:
You get a bite?

33:33.686 --> 33:35.519
McGEE:
A nibble.

33:35.521 --> 33:37.805
That was a gun dealer
up in Philly

33:37.807 --> 33:40.524
who sold a Colt Model
1903 Pocket Hammerless

33:40.526 --> 33:42.193
to a private collector
about six months ago.

33:42.195 --> 33:43.826
That was one of the
guns on Abby's list.

33:43.851 --> 33:44.763
Who's the buyer?

33:44.764 --> 33:46.363
McGEE: Well, that's
the nibble part.

33:46.365 --> 33:48.733
Seems just an hour ago
the dealer got a call

33:48.735 --> 33:51.235
from the buyer begging him
not to give out his name.

33:51.237 --> 33:52.987
Tell me you got
a name, McGee.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.605
No, sir.
The dealer held out.

33:54.607 --> 33:56.490
So instead of waiting
for a warrant,

33:56.492 --> 33:58.659
I talked him into giving me
the shipping address instead.

33:58.661 --> 34:02.112
(computer beeping)

34:03.948 --> 34:05.449
That's not far from the pond.

34:05.451 --> 34:07.134
Not far from Midge's place.

34:07.136 --> 34:10.420
(beeping)
The name on the lease...

34:15.010 --> 34:16.594
Oh. Hey,

34:16.596 --> 34:18.846
Agents David, DiNozzo.
I assume you know

34:18.848 --> 34:20.431
Agent Gibbs.
Of course.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.799
The great Gibbs.

34:21.801 --> 34:23.601
To what do I
owe the honor?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.518
You got a gun collection, Jon?

34:25.521 --> 34:27.353
D-Do <i>I</i> have a gun collection?

34:27.356 --> 34:29.406
Okay, let's go
with your question then.

34:29.408 --> 34:31.809
Sure, I... do
some hunting.

34:31.811 --> 34:33.327
I have a few pieces.

34:33.329 --> 34:34.612
I'd hardly call it
a collection.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.447
TONY: We know a gun dealer
in Philadelphia

34:36.449 --> 34:37.531
who might disagree.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.283
You called him
just a few hours ago.

34:39.284 --> 34:42.920
Only to buy time till
I figured this out.

34:42.922 --> 34:46.590
I couldn't believe when I saw
my 1903 Colt on your list.

34:46.592 --> 34:48.659
Another gun like mine
killing Midge?

34:48.661 --> 34:50.795
I mean, what are the chances?
Slim.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.379
Show us
the weapon.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.998
Yeah, no problem.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.268
Believe me,
that's the first thing I did

34:57.270 --> 34:59.970
when I got home today.

34:59.972 --> 35:03.674
There it was, safe and sound,

35:03.676 --> 35:07.611
right where it's been
since the day I bought it.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.876
Wh-Where's my Colt?

35:21.878 --> 35:24.128
I-It was just there

35:24.130 --> 35:25.813
a couple of hours ago. I...

35:26.915 --> 35:28.999
(phone ringing)

35:29.001 --> 35:29.967
Sit.

35:29.969 --> 35:32.219
Stay.
Yes, sir.

35:34.539 --> 35:36.140
Yeah, Palmer?

35:36.142 --> 35:38.175
You've got Dr. Mallard
here as well, Agent Gibbs.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.643
Good to be back, Jethro.

35:39.645 --> 35:40.845
Ducky,

35:40.847 --> 35:42.146
you're just visiting.

35:42.148 --> 35:45.065
Yeah, well, the lesions
in Midge's trachea

35:45.067 --> 35:46.400
were the result

35:46.402 --> 35:49.069
of a severe anaphylactic
reaction to a chemical

35:49.071 --> 35:50.960
known as a-Terpineol.

35:50.985 --> 35:52.407
It's used in all
sorts of products,

35:52.408 --> 35:53.407
including soaps,

35:53.409 --> 35:55.159
detergents, shampoos,
and colognes.

35:55.161 --> 35:57.411
Okay. Thanks, guys.

35:57.413 --> 35:58.445
(beep)

35:58.447 --> 36:00.331
All clear.

36:00.333 --> 36:02.750
Yeah, the house
is clear, but...

36:02.752 --> 36:04.201
do you smell something?

36:04.203 --> 36:06.203
What?

36:06.205 --> 36:07.371
Nothing.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.206
I-I can prove it wasn't me.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.376
I was getting my arm
stitched at the hospital

36:12.378 --> 36:14.261
till almost midnight
that night.

36:14.263 --> 36:15.412
You call
Saint Miriam's Hospital.

36:15.414 --> 36:16.547
It'll be in their records.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.215
Allow me.

36:20.752 --> 36:22.469
Wear a lot of cologne, Jon?

36:22.471 --> 36:26.056
Why would you
ask that, boss?

36:26.058 --> 36:28.893
Ducky said our killer
had a chemical on him.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.594
Soaps, shampoo...

36:30.596 --> 36:31.929
cologne.

36:31.931 --> 36:33.597
Wilson wore that cheap cologne.

36:33.599 --> 36:34.481
That's right.

36:34.483 --> 36:36.433
JON: I remember
that stink.

36:36.435 --> 36:37.768
It was Wilson.

36:37.770 --> 36:39.069
No, it wasn't.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.621
And it wasn't
cheap cologne.

36:40.623 --> 36:42.539
It was expensive perfume.

36:43.742 --> 36:45.659
You smell it now?

36:45.661 --> 36:46.877
That's my girlfriend's.

36:46.879 --> 36:47.995
You just missed her,
but she'll back me up.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.964
She saw the gun,
same as me.

36:49.966 --> 36:51.215
I'm telling you, it was there.

36:51.217 --> 36:52.917
ZIVA: She was at the hospital
with you, too?

36:52.919 --> 36:54.117
That whole night, yeah.

36:54.119 --> 36:56.804
Except for when she ran home
to get me a clean shirt,

36:56.806 --> 36:59.490
but she was only gone for...

36:59.492 --> 37:01.258
How long?

37:01.260 --> 37:02.927
An hour.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.929
Maybe two.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.263
What else, Jon?

37:06.265 --> 37:08.515
I think I might have said
some things that night.

37:08.517 --> 37:10.150
GIBBS:
What'd you say?

37:10.152 --> 37:11.936
Just stuff
about me...

37:11.938 --> 37:14.304
and Midge and...

37:14.306 --> 37:16.857
how... the bombing
might have made me realize

37:16.859 --> 37:19.076
how much she meant to me.

37:30.321 --> 37:32.706
(crow cawing in distance)

37:32.708 --> 37:35.509
TONY:
Nice arm.

37:36.378 --> 37:38.462
Jon?

37:38.464 --> 37:41.181
Is that you?

37:44.469 --> 37:45.836
(relieved exhale)

37:45.838 --> 37:47.137
Tony.

37:47.139 --> 37:49.139
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.808
Wh-What are you doing out here?

37:50.810 --> 37:53.343
I was just following the little
pings off your cell phone,

37:53.345 --> 37:55.012
wanted to ask you
the same question.

37:55.014 --> 37:56.447
I w... I was just...

37:56.449 --> 37:58.399
Getting rid of
the murder weapon?

37:58.401 --> 38:00.200
Figured they'd already
dredged the pond,

38:00.202 --> 38:02.152
they weren't gonna
do it again?

38:06.992 --> 38:09.076
Turn around.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.961
Wait, wait, Tony,

38:10.963 --> 38:12.746
Tony, just wait, please?

38:12.748 --> 38:14.164
(sighs)

38:14.166 --> 38:16.633
Do you know what it's
like to love someone

38:16.635 --> 38:18.302
who talks about someone
else constantly?

38:18.304 --> 38:20.137
A woman that
he slept with?

38:20.139 --> 38:23.390
I was the one, I was
the one in the ER with Jon.

38:23.392 --> 38:26.010
I was... it was me,
listening to him go on and on

38:26.012 --> 38:29.430
about how brave she was,
how amazing <i>she</i> was.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.231
(panting)

38:32.183 --> 38:34.568
It's over. Let's go.
Okay, wait,

38:34.570 --> 38:37.021
wait, wait.

38:38.723 --> 38:41.358
Don't you want
to frisk me first?

38:47.248 --> 38:49.700
Good night, Midge.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.835
(sighs):
Sleep tight.

38:51.837 --> 38:53.921
Felt good to have
you back, Doctor.

38:53.923 --> 38:56.590
Yes, emphasis on
"felt," past tense.

38:56.592 --> 38:59.293
But I am not
really back at all.

38:59.295 --> 39:02.245
Well, felt like you were.

39:02.247 --> 39:03.964
And once again,
it wasn't easy for me

39:03.966 --> 39:05.849
to admit that
I needed your help.

39:05.851 --> 39:09.386
Mr. Palmer, it took my ego
some time to subside,

39:09.388 --> 39:12.422
allowing me to realize that
you are perfectly capable

39:12.424 --> 39:14.775
of performing
those tests by yourself.

39:14.777 --> 39:16.643
I recall a similar case
of anaphylaxis

39:16.645 --> 39:18.779
that we dealt with
together,

39:18.781 --> 39:20.864
almost three years ago.

39:20.866 --> 39:22.099
Emphasis on "together."

39:22.101 --> 39:24.401
Stop making it
so bloody difficult for me

39:24.403 --> 39:25.903
to be angry with you!

39:27.739 --> 39:29.439
What-what I need

39:29.441 --> 39:31.408
is to feel useful again.

39:31.410 --> 39:34.128
What I don't need
is anyone's charity.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.963
Dr. Mallard...
Not...

39:35.965 --> 39:40.784
that I don't appreciate your
misguided efforts, Mr. Palmer,

39:40.786 --> 39:43.053
but I must take my leave.

39:43.055 --> 39:44.721
And as for my return,

39:44.723 --> 39:48.509
I believe I have
some serious thinking to do.

39:52.063 --> 39:54.848
You might notice, Director,
that my report is not...

39:54.850 --> 39:56.150
entirely finished.

39:56.152 --> 39:59.520
Well, I knew Gibbs
would give you a hard time.

39:59.522 --> 40:02.806
I see that he and Miss Sciuto
are listed as incomplete.

40:02.808 --> 40:04.775
Is there anyone else?

40:04.777 --> 40:07.077
That would be you, sir.

40:07.079 --> 40:10.313
Mandatory psych evaluations
for the <i>entire</i> agency.

40:10.315 --> 40:11.665
Yeah, I got the memo.

40:11.667 --> 40:14.284
I'm just not so certain
that I need to be evaluated.

40:15.486 --> 40:17.487
It's been brought
to my attention--

40:17.489 --> 40:20.323
and frankly,
I've observed myself-- that...

40:20.325 --> 40:22.376
you seem increasingly
irritable of late.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.128
Brought to your attention
by whom?

40:24.130 --> 40:26.513
You've clearly been taking
the disappearance

40:26.515 --> 40:29.249
and death of Ms. Watkins...

40:29.251 --> 40:32.019
more personally than most.

40:35.807 --> 40:38.225
If I had one wish...

40:38.227 --> 40:42.062
it would be to turn
the clocks back to...

40:42.064 --> 40:43.847
to before.

40:43.849 --> 40:45.199
Which would explain
your insistence

40:45.201 --> 40:47.201
that everything
get "back to normal."

40:48.536 --> 40:52.206
Even the color
of the paint.

40:52.208 --> 40:54.791
You do know that...

40:54.793 --> 40:57.294
without your car, Harper Dearing
would have found

40:57.296 --> 40:59.429
another way to
plant his device.

40:59.431 --> 41:02.015
But he didn't need to, did he?

41:02.017 --> 41:04.651
I parked that car
in my driveway.

41:04.653 --> 41:09.256
I drove my kids to school
in it that morning.

41:13.878 --> 41:16.880
So...

41:16.882 --> 41:20.651
when I think what being
that vulnerable could've cost,

41:20.653 --> 41:22.853
I...

41:24.689 --> 41:26.907
It's all right, Leon.

41:26.909 --> 41:29.526
Everyone is safe.

41:31.613 --> 41:34.865
And no one's
blaming you.

41:43.841 --> 41:46.043
(sighs)

41:48.963 --> 41:51.465
(door opens)
ABBY: Gibbs! Gibbs!

41:51.467 --> 41:54.101
Abbs.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

41:54.103 --> 41:56.303
(laughs): You're welcome.
For what?

41:57.138 --> 41:59.389
This is Kyle, my brother.

41:59.391 --> 42:01.525
Kyle, this is who
I've been telling you about.

42:01.527 --> 42:03.610
This is Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

42:03.612 --> 42:05.112
Hi, Kyle.

42:05.114 --> 42:07.264
(Kyle grunts)

42:07.266 --> 42:08.398
Thank you, Leroy.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.267
I-It's Gibbs.
Call him Gibbs.

42:10.269 --> 42:12.435
Who knew hugs
were in my blood?

42:12.437 --> 42:13.654
(Abby chuckles)

42:15.123 --> 42:17.374
Well, this is worth celebrating.
You want a beer?

42:17.376 --> 42:19.609
Yeah.
Sounds good.

42:22.130 --> 42:23.797
What a day.

42:23.799 --> 42:25.966
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

42:25.968 --> 42:29.553
I had a feeling when
I saw Abby last year,

42:29.555 --> 42:31.505
we had a connection,
you know?

42:31.507 --> 42:34.975
If it wasn't for you, she
might have never come back.

42:34.977 --> 42:37.561
Not me.
It's all her.

42:37.563 --> 42:39.596
It's a lot to take in,
that's for sure.

42:39.598 --> 42:42.733
Having a sister you
never even knew existed.

42:42.735 --> 42:44.901
Isn't that right, Abby?

42:46.321 --> 42:47.688
(laughs)

42:49.774 --> 42:51.441
(whispers):
To family.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.026
