he probably is.

Don't.

It's for emergencies.
Can I go?

03:34.959 --> 03:36.500
It's a housewarming.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.709
Bunchy bought a house?

03:41.875 --> 03:43.959
For who?

03:44.041 --> 03:45.458
For him and Mick.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.500
He didn't tell me
he was buying a house.

03:47.583 --> 03:48.709
What, he didn't ask
your permission?
BRIDGET: Can I?

03:48.792 --> 03:51.250
No.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.417
Nobody goes to that house.
And if Mickey calls

either of you again,
I want to know about it.

04:21.792 --> 04:23.709

04:25.792 --> 04:27.166
The marina.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.750
The marina?
Yeah.

04:28.834 --> 04:29.709
Are you buying a boat?

04:29.792 --> 04:31.000

The dead priest.

04:39.792 --> 04:42.166
Is that the guy
that abused Bunchy?

04:42.250 --> 04:44.125
Come on, Abs, you know
I can't talk about business.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.917
How is that business, Ray?

04:48.333 --> 04:51.166
See, this is
what I'm talking about.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.417
This is it, just behind
the frontal sinus.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.792
But the incision
is going to be right...

05:01.875 --> 05:04.625
there.

05:04.709 --> 05:07.792
Just a little nick in
the shape of an eyelash,

05:07.875 --> 05:10.542
just enough for the laser
to get in and zap the tumor.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.375
And that's it?

05:12.458 --> 05:15.458
Well, we won't know until we
start hitting it with radiation.

05:15.542 --> 05:17.834
What we need to avoid
is the optic nerve.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.458
That is a biggie.

05:19.542 --> 05:22.542
All right, so I'll see
you in a couple hours.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.375
What's he gonna do?
It's going to be okay.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.375
He's, uh, going
to shrink the tumor.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.166
No! What are they doing?

05:30.250 --> 05:33.208
Are they shaving my head?
I pride myself on my hair.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.417
You know that.
I know that. I know that.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.500
Just a little bit,
sweetheart.
Where's Ray?

05:37.583 --> 05:40.792
I want to talk to Ray.
Uh... Okay.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.709

05:50.125 --> 05:51.917

05:52.000 --> 05:54.417
Ha.
Yeah.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.792
Your little SNAP group
really come through.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.375
Three couches.

05:59.458 --> 06:02.417
(grunts)
Got to give
those Snappers credit.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.542
I don't know.
Hey.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.959
You just bought a house.
Where's your...

06:06.041 --> 06:07.750
where's your gusto? Huh?

06:07.834 --> 06:10.000
And why not get
some new furniture?

06:10.083 --> 06:11.500
New furniture.
Little accessories.

06:11.583 --> 06:15.250
Ray's gonna be so fucking pissed
I bought this place.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.125
I'm not supposed to be spending
so much money.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.083
Ah, bullshit.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.959
Maybe you are a bad influence.

06:21.041 --> 06:25.291
Whoa. Wow.

06:25.375 --> 06:28.875
All right, then.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.625
But the decor really
could use a woman's touch.

06:34.709 --> 06:37.625
What, hookers?

06:37.709 --> 06:39.625
Knock it off.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.709

06:47.208 --> 06:48.041
Hello?

06:48.125 --> 06:48.750
It's your father-in-law.

06:48.834 --> 06:51.500
Hi, Mick.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.917
Abby, look. I want to respect
Ray's boundary issues.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.125
I do.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.166
Uh-huh.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.667
Look, uh...

06:59.750 --> 07:02.125
I got a little bit
of a situation right now.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.709
Uh, I'm out of my depth here.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.250
Bunchy is freaking out.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.917
He's very fragile.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.041
What's wrong?

07:08.125 --> 07:09.667
Well, it's the house.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.667
Probably could've done better
for the money,

07:11.750 --> 07:17.250
and, uh... all he's got here
is a bunch of, frankly,

07:17.333 --> 07:18.000
pretty disgusting furniture.

07:18.083 --> 07:21.166
All right, listen.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.667
Let me see if I can stop by
after lunch, okay?

07:23.750 --> 07:27.333
Abby, thank you.
From the bottom of my heart.

07:27.417 --> 07:28.709
All right.

07:28.792 --> 07:31.625

I just haven't seen
you wear it before, is all.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.834
It's nice.
I would like the turkey
chili, a bread bowl

08:03.917 --> 08:05.583
and a Polish sausage, sliced
lengthwise down the middle.

08:08.667 --> 08:09.750
And you, sir?

08:09.834 --> 08:12.792
May I have a cup
of coffee, please?

14:50.458 --> 14:53.792
(siren whoops)

14:55.125 --> 14:57.291
Oh.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.959
(garbled radio transmission)

15:10.041 --> 15:11.417
(gasps)

15:11.500 --> 15:13.125
(panting)

15:17.542 --> 15:20.458
Do you have any idea how
fast you were going, sir?

15:22.625 --> 15:25.041
100?
No.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.000
200?

15:26.083 --> 15:29.375
Sir, you were going
three miles an hour.

15:29.458 --> 15:30.834
Three miles. Wow.

15:30.917 --> 15:33.083
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

15:40.917 --> 15:44.250
(panting)

15:44.333 --> 15:45.583
What are you
doing, sir?

15:45.667 --> 15:47.500
Give me that.
I... Oh.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.000
(panting)

15:50.083 --> 15:51.750
Special Agent Miller?

15:51.834 --> 15:54.000
(laughing):
No. No, I... No.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.542
Step out of the
car, please.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.208
(sighs)

16:01.291 --> 16:03.792
You seem a little
under the weather.
I am.

16:03.875 --> 16:07.375
I am having a terrible day.

16:11.917 --> 16:13.458
(grunts softly)

16:13.542 --> 16:15.250
(panting)

16:15.333 --> 16:17.375
Look, I'm going to have to
cite you for reckless driving.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.709
Oh, God.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.333
Sir, have you been drinking?

16:21.417 --> 16:23.375
I had...

16:23.458 --> 16:26.917
a small amount of orange juice
at my home,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.792
and one cup of coffee
with two Equals and some cream.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.083
I'm going to have
to perform a few tests, sir.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.667
You have an incredible voice.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.875
A truly
remarkable voice.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.291
That's fine. Now, I'd like you
to raise your right arm...

16:43.375 --> 16:45.375
Okay.
...and then touch
your finger to your nose.

16:48.291 --> 16:50.625
(knocking)

16:51.792 --> 16:55.041
Abby, thank you for coming.

16:55.125 --> 16:56.792
We're lost at sea.

16:56.875 --> 16:57.834
I wish we could see
more of you.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.417
Here.
You know how things are.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.291
It's charming.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.542
That's a nice piece.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.917
Yeah.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.458
(groans)
Home, sweet home.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.792
(dialing)

17:40.875 --> 17:42.792
(line ringing)

17:42.875 --> 17:44.792
RAY:
Hello?
Yeah. He's home.

17:44.875 --> 17:46.667
Good. Thanks.

17:51.625 --> 17:52.917
Dawg!

17:53.000 --> 17:55.959
What's up, bro?
What you doing here?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.000
You, get the fuck
out of here now.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.834
Ass and mouth, dawg.
I protected myself.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.000
Yeah? Where'd this come from?

18:08.083 --> 18:11.333
(cell phone ringtone plays)
Huh?

18:11.417 --> 18:13.709
Can I get my...?
Oh.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.750
Look at that.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.917
How many kids do you have,
Deonte?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.125
Deonte Junior,
Deonte the Second...

18:21.208 --> 18:24.917
This was Deonte the Third.
What you doing, Ray?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.333
Calling your wife back so she
can jog your fucking memory.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.834
Whoa. No, no,
don't do that.

18:28.917 --> 18:31.041
(line ringing)
That would be a bad idea.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.792
MRS. BROWN:
Where the fuck have you been?

18:32.875 --> 18:34.333
She sounds pissed.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.417
Hello? Hello?
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.333
Deonte?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.333
Deonte?
How much did you make last year?

18:40.417 --> 18:42.333
I'm talking to you, Deonte.
Uh, $30 million?

18:42.417 --> 18:44.166
What the fuck is wrong with you?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.083
Deonte, this is some bullshit.
Where are you at?

18:46.166 --> 18:48.417
I know. I know.
Never again, Ray.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.333
You keep this shit up,
you're gonna lose your sponsors.

18:50.417 --> 18:51.750
You'll end up teaching
the pick-and-roll

18:51.834 --> 18:53.166
to a bunch
of fucking fifth graders.

18:53.250 --> 18:53.875
All right?
All right.

18:53.959 --> 18:55.208
You better say something.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.917
I'm not playing
with you this time.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.208
Hello?

19:00.291 --> 19:01.625
Hel-lo!

19:01.709 --> 19:03.667
Deonte!
(door opens and closes)

19:03.750 --> 19:05.375
Babe, hey.

19:05.458 --> 19:08.500
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Any available nurse to room...

19:08.583 --> 19:10.750
Ray will be here any minute,
sweetheart.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.458
(gasping)

19:26.542 --> 19:29.041
(panting)

19:30.333 --> 19:32.000
Oh.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.583
(panting)

19:50.625 --> 19:53.417
(panting)

19:55.834 --> 19:57.458
(panting)

20:06.333 --> 20:07.875
Oh, my friend.

20:07.959 --> 20:10.417
My friend.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.750
Okay. Okay.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.834
(man grunting)

20:17.625 --> 20:19.166
(gasps)
Wh...

20:19.250 --> 20:20.166
(grunts)

20:20.250 --> 20:20.750
(shouts)

20:20.834 --> 20:23.375
(groans)

20:23.458 --> 20:25.375
(motorcycle revving)

20:25.458 --> 20:28.041
(laughing, whooping)

20:28.125 --> 20:30.834
(motorcycle approaching)

20:37.792 --> 20:40.000
(laughs, shouts)

20:40.083 --> 20:42.750
(automatic gunfire,
bullets ricocheting)

20:50.208 --> 20:53.000
(Mickey and Bunchy
speaking indistinctly)

20:55.959 --> 20:59.083
Hey, what did I
tell you? Huh?

21:01.208 --> 21:02.542
Thanks for your help, guys.

21:03.792 --> 21:04.917
Hey, you guys gonna come?

21:06.250 --> 21:09.583
You can meet Terry's
new girlfriend.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.291
No, I-I don't think
she can make it.

21:13.375 --> 21:13.834
ABBY:
Yeah, I wish we could.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.542
It's movie night.

21:17.625 --> 21:20.375
Ah.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.333
Hey.
What?

21:22.417 --> 21:23.959
She drove all the way here.

21:24.041 --> 21:26.291
Come on.
Yeah.

21:26.375 --> 21:30.583
It's really... lovely,
Abby. Thank you.

21:30.667 --> 21:33.583
Yeah, I like what you did
with the chairs and the flowers.

21:34.750 --> 21:35.250
It's getting there.

21:35.333 --> 21:38.125
It's good
for tonight.

21:38.208 --> 21:41.500
It's just... I might not
be keeping the place.

21:41.583 --> 21:44.000
Bunchy, you don't
just return a house.

21:47.709 --> 21:50.417
Hey, I got a bunch of stuff in
the car. Couple of brown boxes.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.792
You and Terry grab 'em,
take 'em upstairs?

21:55.458 --> 21:56.750
Movie night, huh?

21:56.834 --> 21:58.542
Give me a fucking
break, Mick.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.208
Ray finds out I'm here...

22:00.291 --> 22:01.709
Hey. Look.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.625
(both chuckle)

22:09.417 --> 22:11.375
(sighs, sniffles)

22:11.458 --> 22:13.834
(footsteps approaching)

22:15.000 --> 22:17.625
(Van panting)

22:17.709 --> 22:19.750
(door creaks open)

22:40.500 --> 22:43.417
(shoes squeak)

23:15.166 --> 23:15.208
You're having a bad day,
aren't you, pal?

23:23.375 --> 23:24.625
What's with the toys, Van?

23:24.709 --> 23:26.000
(exhales, pants)

23:26.083 --> 23:27.417
You got, like, a...

23:27.500 --> 23:30.875
Hollywood fetish going on
or something?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.375
You want one
of these guys

23:34.458 --> 23:36.500
to fuck you or... beat you up?

23:39.041 --> 23:41.000
Maybe.

23:41.083 --> 23:43.125
Okay.

23:44.375 --> 23:46.542
I got something
to show you.

23:52.208 --> 23:53.166
VAN:
You have an incredible voice.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.041
A truly remarkable voice.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.625
Really struggled with
that sobriety test, didn't you?

23:58.709 --> 24:01.166
STEVE:
That's-that's fine.
Now... now, I'd like you to...

24:01.250 --> 24:03.041
I know they're hard,
but that's, uh...

24:05.792 --> 24:06.667
Well, you were there.

24:06.750 --> 24:10.166
All right, put your arm...
(video stops)

24:11.750 --> 24:13.417
So tell me, Van...

24:13.500 --> 24:16.959
why you talking
to Mickey Donovan?

24:18.834 --> 24:20.583
I'm not talking to him.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.625
Okay.

24:24.709 --> 24:25.959
Now you're just
fucking lying to me.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.041
Uh...
(grunts)

24:28.125 --> 24:29.625
Look at me.

24:29.709 --> 24:31.291
What are you after?
(Velcro opening)

24:31.375 --> 24:34.083
(grunts, panting)

24:38.041 --> 24:38.959
You think
you're the first person

24:39.041 --> 24:41.542
that tried to shut us down,
you dumb fuck?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.542
Your pal Frank tried to
do it eight years ago.

24:45.625 --> 24:46.542
(whimpers)

24:46.625 --> 24:47.500
(exhaling)

24:47.583 --> 24:48.709
RAY:
You see that?

24:48.792 --> 24:50.000
That is gonna
test positive

24:50.083 --> 24:52.250
for LSD for the next six years.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.166
Shit really stays
in your system.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.667
Who else knows
about this?

24:57.750 --> 24:59.208
No one else.

24:59.291 --> 25:00.667
No?

25:00.750 --> 25:01.792
I work alone.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.333
I work alone. Ask Frank.

25:03.417 --> 25:04.583
Ask Frank. Ask...

25:04.667 --> 25:05.792
(heavy breathing)

25:13.667 --> 25:15.250
Look at me, Van.

25:15.333 --> 25:15.917
Don't look there.
Look here, right here.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.583
Look at me.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.959
There is no case.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.542
Okay.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.333
Okay.
All right.

25:24.417 --> 25:25.875
Hold my hands.
I told you everything.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.333
Hold my hands, Van.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.250
I told you everything,
I told you...

25:29.333 --> 25:32.250
(grunting)
You're good.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.458
Here you go.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.959
Call me when you come down.

25:57.792 --> 25:59.625
(grunts)

26:03.083 --> 26:05.542
Wow. (laughs)

26:05.625 --> 26:08.000
Looks great, Abs.
Thanks.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.291
New sheets?

26:11.375 --> 26:13.542
And pillowcases.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.959
And a new set of towels
for your bathroom.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.667
Very plush.

26:21.291 --> 26:22.250
He mad I bought the house?

26:22.333 --> 26:25.834
No, of course not.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.166
He wants to come, Bunchy.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.834
We all do.

26:29.917 --> 26:33.083
Fucking Conor
wouldn't shut up about it.

26:33.166 --> 26:36.000
Really?

26:36.083 --> 26:37.000
He's been texting me all day.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.000
Like, "Please, please,
please, please, please."

26:44.917 --> 26:47.000
It's not movie night.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.917
It's Mickey.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.875
And I get punished?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.917
I know. It's not fair.

26:59.083 --> 27:02.417
He thinks it's Mickey's fault
that I got molested.

27:07.625 --> 27:11.000
You know he tried it on Terry?

27:11.083 --> 27:12.917
The priest?

27:15.875 --> 27:18.041
(low sobbing)

27:18.125 --> 27:20.583
Terry broke his fucking hand.

27:22.959 --> 27:26.291
Ray would've done it, too,
if he tried anything.

27:26.375 --> 27:28.000
Bunchy.

27:28.083 --> 27:30.458
I was a fighter.

27:32.208 --> 27:35.208
Why didn't I try
to stop him?

27:35.291 --> 27:38.583
I thought I wanted
it to happen.

27:40.667 --> 27:41.750
Because that's
what monsters do.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.166
(laughs)

27:49.250 --> 27:50.667
Yeah.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.166
I'm sorry.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.125
Sorry, I don't know
what got into me.

27:58.834 --> 28:01.041
I'm gonna put this
in here.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.417
Extra?
Yeah.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.417
Don't tickle me.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.083
It tickles.

28:16.166 --> 28:20.417
Mmm, I like that. Mmm.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.000
You're not supposed
to be here.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.625
Oh, hey, what up, Money?

28:25.709 --> 28:28.083
Money Man, C-Money.
What's going on?

28:28.166 --> 28:29.959
We're studying.
You're not even
in the same grade.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.417
(scoffs)

28:31.500 --> 28:33.583
Dad's gonna kick your ass.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.875
If he ever comes home.
Shut up. If it weren't
for you pushing it,

28:35.959 --> 28:38.125
we probably would've been able
to go to Bunchy's party.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.250
Yeah, well you're the one
who brought it up.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.750
Are you kidding me?
You're the one
who got me drunk

28:40.834 --> 28:43.166
and made me puke
all over Dad's watches.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.166
Um, no, I didn't.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.542
Yo!

28:45.625 --> 28:46.542
There's a party.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.959
And your folks
ain't home.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.125
What's the problem?

29:00.166 --> 29:02.125
(indistinct chatter)

29:10.375 --> 29:13.250
I found him.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.500
What do you think, Raymond?

29:18.583 --> 29:21.917
That one's supposed to be
smarter, but I don't know.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Something about this one's face
reminds me of Ruth.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.333
I've told your dad
they're not for sale.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.750
Sorry about that.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.000
It's okay.

29:31.083 --> 29:32.458
Come on. (whistles)
Come on.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.417
How did you find me?

29:36.083 --> 29:37.709
Come on, Ezra,
let's get in the car.

29:37.792 --> 29:39.208
No. Sit with me.

29:51.166 --> 29:54.000
Aren't you cold?

29:54.083 --> 29:56.041
There was
a pet store here.

29:56.125 --> 29:56.959
I guess they closed it.

30:00.458 --> 30:02.208
You're about to go in
for brain surgery

30:02.291 --> 30:03.625
and you want to get a dog?

30:03.709 --> 30:04.500
Do you think I want a dog?

30:04.583 --> 30:06.667
I don't even like dogs.

30:06.750 --> 30:10.208
I'm leaving Ruth
a foundation,

30:10.291 --> 30:13.250
an entire hospital
with her name on it,

30:13.333 --> 30:16.083
but I haven't given Debra
a moment's thought.

30:22.542 --> 30:24.417
Okay.

30:24.500 --> 30:28.041
Let's go get a dog.

30:28.125 --> 30:30.500
I know where you're taking me.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.917
And I'm scared, Raymond.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.750
It's gonna be
okay, Ezra.

30:44.834 --> 30:47.083
I promise.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.375
(door opens)

31:05.458 --> 31:08.083
MICKEY:
Got the speaker wire.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.667
Ended up having to go
to Radio Shack.

31:12.417 --> 31:15.250
Holy shit!

31:15.333 --> 31:17.625
Looks pretty good, right?

31:17.709 --> 31:18.333
Pretty good?

31:18.417 --> 31:20.500
Bunchy, come on.

31:20.583 --> 31:23.000
Hope you get her a gift.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.041
Too bad no one's coming.

31:32.875 --> 31:33.583
Shit.

31:33.667 --> 31:36.291
We're gonna need ice.

31:42.458 --> 31:44.208
(blows)

31:48.709 --> 31:50.333
Where's one for me?

31:51.709 --> 31:53.166
How many days
you been off the sauce?

31:55.458 --> 31:57.000
Three.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.542
You want to fuck that up?

32:09.625 --> 32:12.208
I'm old enough
to buy my own house...

32:13.709 --> 32:15.417
I'm old enough to know
when I want a drink.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.875
Suit yourself.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.000
Bottoms up.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.750
Then again, your father
never listened to one word

35:17.834 --> 35:19.959
out of my mouth
when he was your age.

35:20.041 --> 35:22.500

Ba-boom.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.208
(airy whistling)
Come on.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.000
You made it.
Hey!

35:27.083 --> 35:29.917
Look who it is!

35:30.000 --> 35:32.375
Your mom said you weren't
gonna make it, but...

35:32.458 --> 35:34.500
I knew that you
were coming.
So,

35:34.583 --> 35:35.917
this is all yours?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.166
Hey, hey, you want
to hear a funny joke?

35:38.250 --> 35:39.709
Sure.
Okay.

35:39.792 --> 35:41.875
It's about wrestling moves.
Bunchy.

35:41.959 --> 35:44.125
Okay, so, first of all,
you got to know that

35:44.208 --> 35:45.917
this is the Half
Nelson, all right?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.792
And this is
the full...

35:47.875 --> 35:49.375
No, wait.
(laughs)

35:49.458 --> 35:50.875
Start over,
start over. Okay.

35:50.959 --> 35:53.333
Wait. This is the Half
Nelson, and, um...

35:53.417 --> 35:54.000
Fuck. There's
three moves, right?

35:54.083 --> 35:56.041
Well, Pop,
what is it?

35:56.125 --> 35:57.542
What's the punch line?

35:57.625 --> 35:58.625
Maybe it's better
he forgot.

Aah.

some fun, Pa.
Take it easy.

36:20.250 --> 36:21.750

36:21.834 --> 36:23.208

36:23.291 --> 36:26.583
All right, mister,
you come with me.

36:26.667 --> 36:29.083
This house
smells funny.

36:29.166 --> 36:31.041
Yeah, I wonder what that is.

36:31.125 --> 36:32.917
Bridg, dance
with your boy.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.250
I can't. I can't, Marvin.

36:35.333 --> 36:36.917
Oh, my gosh.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.291
He wants to dance, and
I don't want to dance.

36:38.375 --> 36:41.417
Then come over to the
old persons part of the party.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.667
Actually, I want to dance,
and he won't dance.
Oh.

name again?

36:54.792 --> 36:56.125
Uh, Bunchy.

36:56.208 --> 36:59.333
Yeah, Bunchy.
I love that name.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.333
Well, you ready?
Mm-hmm.

37:01.417 --> 37:03.250
Let's do this.
Okay.

37:05.959 --> 37:07.959
Now, you must be thirsty.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.291
Yeah, I am.
Yeah.

37:14.208 --> 37:16.166
Here.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.250

37:18.333 --> 37:20.125

37:27.959 --> 37:31.625
There you go.

37:31.709 --> 37:33.417
Think it would fit
in any of them?

37:38.667 --> 37:42.125
Maybe if I just put in
the first three inches.

37:42.208 --> 37:43.500

Get out of fucking my shithole!

43:04.333 --> 43:06.792
(phone ringing)

43:11.917 --> 43:12.917
Hey, Terry, what's up?

43:13.000 --> 43:16.208
TERRY:
Uh, Bunchy got real upset
about something,

43:16.291 --> 43:17.834
and there's been a small fire.

43:17.917 --> 43:19.917
What do you want me
to do about it?

43:20.000 --> 43:23.709
It's under control now, but...

43:23.792 --> 43:25.834
Ray, look...

43:25.917 --> 43:28.500
Conor and Bridget are here.

43:35.583 --> 43:37.333
(Mickey exhales)

43:37.417 --> 43:40.250
How you feeling? Better?

43:46.625 --> 43:48.041
(car door opens)

43:55.834 --> 43:55.959
Get in the car.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.875
Get in the car, Conor, now.
TERRY: Ray...

44:01.959 --> 44:03.500
Now!
TERRY:
Everybody's all right.

44:06.542 --> 44:08.959
He didn't
do nothing.

44:11.041 --> 44:11.667
Hey, Ray Ray, take it easy.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.291
If you're angry at me, fine.

44:13.375 --> 44:14.458
He's just a little boy.

44:14.542 --> 44:16.792
Where's your sister?

44:16.875 --> 44:17.500
I don't know.

44:17.583 --> 44:19.667
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't go

44:19.750 --> 44:21.500
to more of your
football games.

44:35.417 --> 44:37.041
TERRY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:37.125 --> 44:38.166
Ray, Ray, Ray,
it wasn't his fault.

44:38.250 --> 44:39.083
It just got out of hand!

44:39.166 --> 44:40.917
MICKEY:
Come on, Ray,
put that down.

44:41.000 --> 44:41.333
There's witnesses here.

44:41.417 --> 44:44.417
Your children.

44:53.834 --> 44:56.000
You might've had the balls
to put me away, kid,

44:56.083 --> 44:57.166
but shoot me?

44:57.250 --> 44:58.709
I don't think so.

45:06.041 --> 45:07.625
(grunts)

45:07.709 --> 45:09.333
Grandpa.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.959
(engine starts)

45:13.041 --> 45:14.625
(tires squeal)

45:14.709 --> 45:16.000
Get in the car, honey.

45:16.083 --> 45:16.417
You, too, Conor.

45:16.500 --> 45:18.834
(gun cocks)

45:20.041 --> 45:21.041
TERRY:
Put the fucking gun down!

45:24.291 --> 45:26.333
(chuckles softly)

45:27.542 --> 45:30.625
Daddy, please stop it!

45:30.709 --> 45:31.917
Daddy...

45:32.000 --> 45:35.041
BRIDGET (crying):
Please... stop...

45:48.875 --> 45:50.000
Come on.

45:51.208 --> 45:54.083
Now.

45:56.375 --> 45:58.083
Get in the fucking car!
Stop!

45:58.166 --> 45:58.500
Raymond!

45:58.583 --> 46:00.417
(sobbing)

46:00.500 --> 46:02.500
I'll take them.

46:02.583 --> 46:05.500
(siren wails in distance)

46:05.583 --> 46:07.208
Frances has
got a car.

46:07.291 --> 46:09.041
We'll get 'em home.
They'll be fine.

46:11.250 --> 46:13.000
But you got to calm down.

46:13.083 --> 46:14.250
(sirens approaching)

46:14.333 --> 46:16.041
And you got to get out of here.

46:35.667 --> 46:38.250
(sobbing)

47:07.875 --> 47:09.250
(exhales)

47:09.333 --> 47:11.083
Hello, Raymond.

47:17.875 --> 47:19.250
How you feeling?

47:19.333 --> 47:23.125
Happy to be alive, darling.

47:31.834 --> 47:33.000
What's on your mind, Raymond?

47:36.792 --> 47:38.750
(exhales)

47:38.834 --> 47:40.125
I don't know.

47:44.458 --> 47:45.834
I don't know anymore.

47:45.917 --> 47:48.250
Raymond...

47:50.041 --> 47:52.333
My father.

47:55.041 --> 47:58.291
He's been causing us trouble
since he arrived.

47:58.792 --> 48:01.166
You'll handle it.

48:03.083 --> 48:04.291
No, I won't.

48:09.667 --> 48:11.000
It's over, Ezra.

48:24.166 --> 48:26.000
He's working with the FBI.

48:30.625 --> 48:32.709
(sighs)

48:33.375 --> 48:36.709
I see.

48:40.750 --> 48:43.667
Well...

48:43.750 --> 48:45.333
we're gonna have to kill him.

48:57.250 --> 48:59.542
It's not that simple.

49:03.250 --> 49:05.834
He's still my father.

49:07.166 --> 49:08.166
Hmm.

49:13.125 --> 49:15.417
(exhales)

49:17.083 --> 49:19.208
So...

49:22.458 --> 49:26.291
Who hates him more than we do?

49:32.208 --> 49:34.041
(TV audience applauding,
music plays)
