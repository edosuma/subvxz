an international number,

11:14.241 --> 11:15.874
These people have operated
by their own rules

11:15.876 --> 11:17.742
for too long now.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.944
And in my experience, free reign
leads to gross misconduct.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.681
Well, I haven't seen any.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.716
Are you sure your relationship

11:24.718 --> 11:27.352
with Chin Ho Kelly isn't
clouding your judgment here?

11:27.354 --> 11:30.055
Now, I understand it's
gotten personal for you.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.160
Well, if you feel that way,

11:35.162 --> 11:36.761
why don't you pull me out?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.365
Oh, I see.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.200
You've got eyes on me.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.468
In case I withhold intel,

11:43.470 --> 11:45.336
you still get it anyway.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.172
Well, once it got personal,
I had no choice.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.306
(laughs):
Sir?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.375
With all due respect,
this operation

11:50.377 --> 11:52.077
is a witch hunt.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.662
Excuse me?

11:53.663 --> 11:55.246
You're looking for anything
to bring them down.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.282
Any speck of impropriety.

11:57.284 --> 12:01.152
Because this entire operation
is all about your brother.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.420
Yeah.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.055
I know about that.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.223
And I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna be

12:05.225 --> 12:07.225
a pawn in some
personal vendetta.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.360
I think your forgetting
your place, Inspector.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.996
You're not the one
calling the shots here.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.399
Now, this is what's
gonna happen.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.134
You're gonna go
back to Five-O,

12:16.136 --> 12:18.503
and you will stay under
until you get something.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.305
Is that clear?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.408
And if I refuse?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.845
You're, what-- gonna write me up
for insubordination?

12:26.847 --> 12:29.047
When the San Francisco PD
agreed to participate

12:29.049 --> 12:31.282
in this investigation,
it was with the understanding

12:31.284 --> 12:34.519
that you would be
under my sole supervision.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.988
Wh-Which means you work for me.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.825
So either you do your job...

12:40.827 --> 12:43.995
or you surrender
your badge and gun.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.866
Your choice.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.316
JERRY:
<i> So, we're pretty sure</i>

13:05.318 --> 13:06.885
this is our suspect.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.286
She was seen entering
the hospital about ten minutes

13:08.288 --> 13:10.221
after Tommy Luana
was brought in.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.523
Nice job
dodging the cameras.

13:11.525 --> 13:12.557
Yeah.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.392
I pulled every single angle.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.796
Eight cameras-- not one of them
got a clear shot of her face.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.266
Here she is entering
the doctor's lounge.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.803
And there she is leaving.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.471
Now, this is where
it gets interesting.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.408
See this tattoo?

13:30.410 --> 13:31.409
Yeah, it looks
like a monarch butterfly.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.279
Mm-hmm, now take
a look at this.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.514
This is dash-cam footage from
the patrol car that hit Luana.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.017
It's about a minute
after impact.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.023
Look at that.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.491
Same ink.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.425
Our suspect
was at the scene.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.227
Mm-hmm, not only that.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.095
HPD canvas turned up a witness

13:51.097 --> 13:54.065
who says she saw a woman
in a hooded sweatshirt

13:54.067 --> 13:57.101
running after Luana right before
he ran into oncoming traffic.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.403
All right,
I'm thinking

13:58.405 --> 14:01.005
Tommy Luana was trying
to flag down the patrol car.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.875
Mm-hmm, except he was reckless
and got hit instead.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.510
Meanwhile, our suspect
hangs around,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.445
finds out what hospital
he's being brought to

14:07.447 --> 14:08.513
and follows him there.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.548
I already ran the tattoo

14:10.550 --> 14:12.350
through the HPD database,
came up empty.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.619
All right, so the lab just
pulled location data

14:14.621 --> 14:16.020
off of Tommy Luana's
cell phone.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.088
I think we may have a lead.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.090
So yesterday afternoon,

14:19.092 --> 14:22.360
Luana visited an herbal
medicine shop in Chinatown.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.095
Owner's name is David Yang.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.531
This guy used to be
a big-deal plastic surgeon,

14:26.533 --> 14:29.367
until about 20 years
ago when he got popped

14:29.369 --> 14:30.501
for selling oxycodone
prescriptions

14:30.503 --> 14:31.636
and lost his license.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.338
But here's the
interesting part.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.674
Yang's actually been

14:35.675 --> 14:38.009
on HPD's radar for a while,
because the word is

14:38.011 --> 14:39.510
Yang does backroom
surgery for cash.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.979
Mostly underworld clientele.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.981
Oh, so you're thinking that
whatever was embedded

14:42.983 --> 14:44.415
inside of Luana,
that Yang put it there.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.150
Yeah, Luana can't just
walk into a health clinic

14:46.152 --> 14:47.418
and ask for that procedure.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.354
All right, Danny and I are gonna

14:49.356 --> 14:51.022
check out this Dr. Yang.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.523
If we can find out
what Luana was carrying,

14:52.525 --> 14:54.959
it might help us I.D.
our killer.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.199
(clears his throat)

15:02.936 --> 15:04.402
Oh, boy.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.405
What's with the eye roll?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.308
You got poop in a jar.
"What's with the eye roll?"

15:10.310 --> 15:11.910
This is not poop.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.177
This is black mushroom.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.579
This is a, uh,
this is a very, uh...

15:14.581 --> 15:16.481
It has a lot
of healing properties,

15:16.483 --> 15:19.517
this particular fungus.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.386
Hmm, I don't get how people buy
into this new-age science crap.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.520
Whoa, whoa.
I don't understand.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.022
Traditional Chinese medicine

15:24.024 --> 15:25.490
has-has been around
for centuries.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.225
It's hardly new-age science.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.160
It's hardly science. I don't
know about that, actually.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.561
I took some cat's claw once
as a pain reliever.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.397
It worked pretty good.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.299
Almost as good as aspirin,
I'd say.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.500
I-I will stick with the aspirin.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.035
And you can waste your money

15:37.037 --> 15:39.137
and time on this
voodoo medicine

15:39.139 --> 15:41.105
peddled by, uh, quacks.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.540
(laughs)

15:42.542 --> 15:45.209
Dr. Yang is no quack.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.644
Dr. Yang
is a healer.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.480
Of the mind,
the body

15:49.482 --> 15:50.682
and the soul.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.083
Dr. Yang

15:52.085 --> 15:53.551
is also in big trouble

15:53.553 --> 15:56.321
for implanting
small foreign objects

15:56.323 --> 15:58.389
into people's bodies.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.593
I think I should
talk to my lawyer.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.962
Your lawyer? What you
want to do that for?

16:03.964 --> 16:06.130
We just want to have
a friendly conversation.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.598
DANNY: Tell me,
do you, uh,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.567
recognize this guy?

16:09.569 --> 16:11.069
No.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.103
Nice try.
Look.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.788
We know he came here.

16:13.789 --> 16:15.472
We know he left with something
implanted in his body.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.976
We want to know
what that something is.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.644
Doctor/patient privilege.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.980
Ask him.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.382
Well, he's unfortunately dead,
so we can't

16:24.384 --> 16:26.317
ask him anything,
unless maybe you got

16:26.319 --> 16:28.653
some magic potion that can
bring him back to life.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.324
I'm sorry, I really don't
know anything about that.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.493
Look, we know
you're not responsible.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.128
All the same,
I want to talk to my lawyer.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.162
No, no.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.564
Trust me,
you want to, you want

16:39.566 --> 16:41.132
to talk to us,
'cause if you don't talk to us,

16:41.134 --> 16:43.534
we are going
to tell everybody, uh,

16:43.536 --> 16:45.570
that you are
snitching for Five-O.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.338
We're gonna put
the word out on the street

16:47.340 --> 16:49.140
that you've given us the name
of every single scumbag

16:49.142 --> 16:51.476
that you ever
stitched up in this place.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.611
Imagine what they'll do to you.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.648
YANG:
Okay.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.618
This guy needed
a temporary implant.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.520
All I did was the needle work.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.455
What you implant?

17:14.567 --> 17:16.667
(grunting)

17:23.643 --> 17:25.610
A flash drive.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.545
Yeah.  DANNY:  Okay.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.580
What was, what was
on the flash drive?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.416
I don't know.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.184
And I didn't ask.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.620
All right,
how'd you guys hook up?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.522
He was sent here by another man.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.257
A customer who had been here
a few times before.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.526
This man even
paid for the job.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.695
Good, okay.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.597
What, what was his name?

17:46.599 --> 17:48.733
KONO:
Chris Dalton, 32, no record.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.468
According to LinkedIn,

17:50.470 --> 17:53.638
he's a cyber strategist
at Sillex Labs.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.174
It's a computer company
with offices here on the island.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.643
I'm uploading the address
to your GPS now.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.311
Okay, question.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.679
What's a cyber strategist?

18:01.681 --> 18:02.747
Yes.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.282
Basically, his job is to protect

18:04.284 --> 18:06.717
computer systems from hackers.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.419
I also ran Dalton's financials.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.821
And in addition to the 5K

18:09.823 --> 18:11.622
he paid Dr. Yang,

18:11.624 --> 18:12.940
he also slipped ten to Luana

18:12.941 --> 18:14.257
and bought his plane ticket
to Hong Kong.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.727
And it looks like Dalton

18:16.729 --> 18:18.763
was gonna follow him there,
too, because

18:18.765 --> 18:20.765
he's booked on a flight that
leaves the day after tomorrow.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.101
Not anymore he's not.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.610
You gonna keep looking
at your watch every ten seconds?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.213
They said five minutes
ten minutes ago, all right?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.380
Um, th-they said that.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.482
Gentlemen?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.386
Gentlemen, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.071
I'm Elliot Brenner.

18:44.072 --> 18:45.755
Unfortunately, Mr. Dalton
is unavailable at the moment.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.008
But he's here, well, you,

18:47.009 --> 18:48.259
well, you're gonna have
to make him available.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.694
Well, he's in the middle

18:49.696 --> 18:51.295
of something very important.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.864
Can I ask what this is about?

18:52.866 --> 18:55.700
It's about a homicide
that we're working.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.835
And we think he's connected,
so...

18:57.837 --> 19:00.171
we'd like to see him.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.475
He's in here.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.677
Open it.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.646
You keep him
locked up?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.781
He's sequestered right now.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.583
Mr. Dalton is
currently the subject

19:12.585 --> 19:14.252
of an internal investigation.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.720
What he do?

19:15.722 --> 19:17.855
I'm not at liberty
to talk about it.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.906
Guess Chris didn't want to
talk about it, either, huh?

19:44.217 --> 19:45.316
Where's he park his car?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.218
Over here.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.920
STEVE: How many ways in
and out of this area?

19:48.922 --> 19:51.189
Just one.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.394
He's gone.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.828
Danny, get an alert
out right away.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.764
Have Kono and Grover check
Dalton's house, all right?

20:01.501 --> 20:02.967
Let's try this again.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.169
What exactly did Dalton do?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.370
Our company manages
computer systems for the NSA.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.973
Because Dalton
was on the account,

20:08.975 --> 20:10.641
he was given top-level
security clearance.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.878
We believe he used it
to download classified material.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.713
What kind of material?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.915
Black ops intel.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.718
Files on active
non-official cover agents.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.453
We're not sure why or what
he planned to do with it.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.854
We were about to question him
when you guys showed up.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.990
Is there any chance
that Dalton could've put

20:25.992 --> 20:28.292
that information
onto a flash drive?

20:28.294 --> 20:29.927
We're still running
diagnostics on his hardware,

20:29.929 --> 20:31.729
but, yeah, that's the
most likely scenario.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.930
Look, uh, this woman?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.732
She killed three people
this morning,

20:34.734 --> 20:36.367
trying to get her hands
on a flash drive

20:36.369 --> 20:39.437
that Dalton was trying
to smuggle out of the country.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.965
Most of the agents
have been recalled.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.667
Great.
The bad news is

31:43.669 --> 31:45.269
there are still
a few deep cover operatives

31:45.271 --> 31:46.970
who, at the moment,
can't be reached.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.273
All right.
Well, you'll be happy to hear

31:49.275 --> 31:51.141
that Dalton took steps
to encode those files

31:51.143 --> 31:53.143
on that drive in such a way
that only he can access them.

31:53.145 --> 31:56.046
So for now,
the information is safe.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.247
That is good to hear.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.049
Of course,
no encryption is foolproof.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.617
The people that are
behind this will throw

32:00.619 --> 32:02.286
everything they have into breaking it.
I'm sure you're right.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.487
But at least
we've bought ourselves

32:03.489 --> 32:04.655
some time to find them.

32:04.657 --> 32:05.923
At the very least,

32:05.925 --> 32:07.224
time to find those operatives

32:07.226 --> 32:08.525
who were potentially
compromised now

32:08.527 --> 32:09.559
and pull them out of the field.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.461
Actually, that's why I'm here.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.996
You might be able
to help with that.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.848
How so?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.699
Your name came up in connection
with one of the operatives.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.368
The CIA's been desperate
trying to reach her,

32:18.370 --> 32:19.369
but they've had no luck.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.338
I think everyone's hoping

32:21.340 --> 32:22.472
you might have a direct line.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.341
All right, Brenner.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.243
I... I don't know
where Doris is, okay?

32:26.245 --> 32:28.145
I'm not talking
about your mother, Commander.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.547
I'm talking about
Lt. Catherine Rollins.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.983
What?

32:32.985 --> 32:36.987
Apparently, she's called you
a few times from a sat phone.

32:36.989 --> 32:41.391
Yeah, she's, uh, she's doing
aid work in South Asia.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.994
According to the information
that we have,

32:43.996 --> 32:47.464
she's involved in
a clandestine operation in Kiev.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.565
Ukraine?

32:48.567 --> 32:50.400
Yes.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.202
Do you have any way
of reaching her?

32:52.204 --> 32:55.038
My understanding is
she's not scheduled

32:55.040 --> 32:57.541
to check in with her handler
until the end of the week.

32:57.543 --> 33:00.610
Of course, the fear is that
by then it might be too late.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.548
Commander?

33:04.550 --> 33:07.250
Do you have a direct line
to Lieutenant Rollins?

33:07.252 --> 33:09.252
No.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.254
No, I don't.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.706

33:29.708 --> 33:32.275
Now, tell me you're the only one

Yes.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.080
Yes.

33:37.082 --> 33:40.550
I encrypted the file
with a 128-bit AES key,

33:40.552 --> 33:43.120
and I, uh, tacked on a few
additional security measures.
