do something crazy like that.

14:43.433 --> 14:45.825
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

14:45.860 --> 14:48.211
It's okay, Zeb. This is on them.

14:48.246 --> 14:49.904
(SHIP CHIMING)

14:49.939 --> 14:51.600
According to Imperial chatter,
they crashed.

14:51.624 --> 14:55.334
The Empire's gonna pour everything
they have into the search,

14:55.369 --> 14:58.387
but we can't contact them
without risking a signal trace.

14:58.422 --> 15:00.848
It doesn't matter.
We have to find them.

15:00.883 --> 15:03.434
(SHIP ROARING)

15:11.519 --> 15:14.070
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:14.105 --> 15:16.489
(BOTH PANTING)

15:21.387 --> 15:23.454
(LOTH-CAT GROWLS AND MEOWS)

15:24.474 --> 15:25.623
This way.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.290
(LOTH-CAT PURRS)

15:36.502 --> 15:37.502
(LOTH-CAT MEWLS)

15:37.962 --> 15:40.412
Look.

15:40.448 --> 15:42.509
We can hide the hyperdrive in
there and come back for it later.

15:42.533 --> 15:43.932
We'll make better time
without it.

15:43.968 --> 15:45.860
How did you know that was here?

15:45.895 --> 15:47.353
I followed the white loth-cat.

15:47.388 --> 15:49.897
White loth-cat?

15:49.932 --> 15:52.158
Are you sure you didn't
hit your head in the crash?

15:52.193 --> 15:53.353
Just help me get it in there.

15:56.447 --> 15:58.656
(HYPERDRIVE SCRAPING)

16:11.187 --> 16:12.420
(LOTH-WOLF HOWLS)

16:15.116 --> 16:16.116
Hey, you coming?

16:23.925 --> 16:26.559
(SHIPS WHIRRING)

16:36.855 --> 16:38.396
We've located
the crash, Admiral,

16:38.431 --> 16:40.355
but there's no sign
of the rebels.

16:40.391 --> 16:42.666
I'm initiating a search.
They won't escape.

16:42.701 --> 16:43.892
Very good, Governor.

16:43.928 --> 16:45.269
Secure the site.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.537
Ground units are en route.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.798
RYDER: I'm picking up a lot of
Imperial patrols on the scanner.

16:54.822 --> 16:56.822
It's okay. Ezra and
Sabine have each other.

16:56.857 --> 16:58.458
They'll find their way home.

16:58.493 --> 17:00.134
I'll monitor
the Empire's chatter

17:00.169 --> 17:01.886
and keep the engines warm,
just in case.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.599
SABINE: Did they see us?
No, I don't think so.

17:29.623 --> 17:30.515
We gotta keep moving.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.083
(LOTH-WOLF HOWLING)

17:36.506 --> 17:39.323
Ezra. Ezra!

17:39.358 --> 17:40.718
Hey, I said
we need to keep moving!

17:41.803 --> 17:42.803
What is it?

17:45.089 --> 17:47.356
I... I thought I saw something.

17:47.391 --> 17:50.443
I think it's a... Loth-wolf.

17:50.478 --> 17:52.878
No one's seen them
in a hundred years,

17:52.913 --> 17:54.166
but I think
I keep seeing one today.

17:54.190 --> 17:56.123
A loth-wolf?

17:56.159 --> 17:57.841
Like from those old
cave paintings?

17:57.877 --> 17:59.068
Yeah...

18:00.413 --> 18:02.029
(LOTH-WOLF GROWLING)

18:04.767 --> 18:05.767
Sabine!

18:07.644 --> 18:09.995
Sleep...

18:11.690 --> 18:13.816
Sabine!

18:13.851 --> 18:15.251
(STAMMERING)
What did you do to her?

18:16.688 --> 18:19.004
(LOTH-WOLF GROWLS)

18:24.670 --> 18:25.670
(LOTH-CAT MEOWS)

18:27.423 --> 18:28.423
(LOTH-CAT MEOWS)

18:34.530 --> 18:35.530
I don't believe it.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.084
I thought I was just
imagining things earlier.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.904
(LOTH-WOLF GROWLING)

18:46.608 --> 18:48.178
I'm glad you don't
like the Empire either.

18:48.202 --> 18:49.202
They're looking for us.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.758
Are you sure it's okay?

19:04.794 --> 19:06.260
(LOTH-WOLF MOANS GENTLY)

19:19.825 --> 19:21.483
(LOTH-WOLF PANTING)

19:35.549 --> 19:37.399
Thank you.

19:37.435 --> 19:38.435
(GROWLS)

20:09.325 --> 20:11.659
I don't understand.
Why did you help us?

20:14.104 --> 20:16.580
Dume...

20:17.967 --> 20:19.566
HERA: Ezra!

20:19.602 --> 20:20.709
Sabine!

20:23.063 --> 20:25.072
(SIGHS) Thank goodness
you're safe.

20:25.107 --> 20:27.124
How did you get
back here so fast?

20:27.159 --> 20:30.177
Didn't you see the... Loth-wolf?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.582
Sabine?

20:35.618 --> 20:37.176
(GROANS)

20:37.211 --> 20:39.945
I don't remember
seeing anything.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.105
I just heard you say "wolf."

20:44.727 --> 20:46.460
Is that the...

20:46.496 --> 20:48.470
Flight data recorder
from the TIE defender elite.

20:48.506 --> 20:49.814
All Sabine's idea.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.874
We got the hyperdrive too.

20:51.909 --> 20:54.193
Stashed it in the rocks
near the crash.

20:54.228 --> 20:56.603
I think it'll work
in our U-wing.

20:56.638 --> 20:58.438
Then we can come and go
off this rock.

20:58.474 --> 20:59.540
Well done, you two.

21:01.244 --> 21:03.953
Kanan, there was a wolf.

21:03.988 --> 21:05.688
And there's
something more to it.

21:05.723 --> 21:06.930
What, I don't know.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.782
I believe you.

21:08.817 --> 21:10.078
All paths are
coming together now.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.144
What does that mean?

21:12.180 --> 21:14.304
I don't know.

21:14.339 --> 21:22.339
We'll have to find out
when we get there.
