WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:11.110
         - How'd I get?

00:11.579 --> 00:13.178
      How did I get here?

00:14.749 --> 00:16.280
          Where am I?

00:16.283 --> 00:18.117
           Oh, fuck.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.319
           I'm here.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.254
      I don't belong here.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.489
        I was out there.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.025
      How did I get here?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.326
           I'm there.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.128
           I'm there.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.329
              Hmm?

00:30.331 --> 00:32.531
           (humming)

00:37.238 --> 00:39.538
           (grunting)

00:46.680 --> 00:47.546
             Okay.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.350
         Can you stop?

00:51.352 --> 00:52.317
              No.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.385
          Okay, stop.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.221
   Okay, what are you doing?

00:57.324 --> 01:00.426
       Okay, um, nuh-uh.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.661
      Stop, stop, nuh-uh.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.096
   Stop it, stop it, stop it!

01:06.367 --> 01:07.466
            Nuh-uh.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.169
          (whimpering)

01:11.505 --> 01:12.438
              No!

01:12.440 --> 01:14.640
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:14.642 --> 01:15.707
              No!

01:15.709 --> 01:17.176
          (screaming)
           (grunting)

01:17.178 --> 01:18.277
            Stop it!

01:18.279 --> 01:19.645
            Stop it!

01:19.647 --> 01:24.450
          (whimpering)
           (grunting)

01:30.424 --> 01:33.525
       (heavy breathing)

02:16.437 --> 02:18.604
            (crying)

03:22.703 --> 03:24.403
       And then it hits.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.441
      (melancholic music)

03:55.569 --> 03:57.803
        Waking up these
      days was never easy.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.872
        Especially when
       you haven't slept.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.443
      Especially when you
        refuse to sleep.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.579
    The sun seemed to creep
      in through the glass

04:07.581 --> 04:09.948
     as her disappointment
    just laid there with her

04:11.518 --> 04:13.518
   The curtains would remain
    closed for another hour

04:13.520 --> 04:16.421
        as she took in a
    series of deep breaths.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.326
   She needed these to become
    who she would be today.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.528
    Each one harder to take.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.702
        - [Toby] So what
       are you gonna do?

04:33.340 --> 04:34.773
       What are you gonna
         say to people?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.476
              Huh?

04:37.478 --> 04:38.677
    What are you gonna say?

04:39.546 --> 04:40.612
    Who's gonna believe you?

05:15.049 --> 05:18.817
      You don't trust me?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.554
   (upbeat melancholic music)

05:55.656 --> 05:59.424
   (water splashing faintly)

06:33.427 --> 06:35.060
     - [Helen Voiceover] He
     used to always tell me

06:36.130 --> 06:38.764
breathing is easy for the weak.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.867
       (heavy breathing)

06:46.840 --> 06:49.574
        (phone ringing)

07:02.523 --> 07:03.455
     - [Answering Machine]
         Hello, no one

07:03.457 --> 07:05.190
is available to take your call.

07:05.192 --> 07:08.527
     Please leave a message
        after the tone.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.694
  (answering machine beeping)

07:09.696 --> 07:10.829
        - [Georgia] Hi.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.199
        I know you don't
       wanna talk to me.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.767
 Just tell me that you're safe.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.836
            Please.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.172
        It's your mama.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.822
- Hmm, look at all these people.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.760
      Just walking around.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.837
     What are you all just
       doing down there?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.673
      What is so exciting?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.946
      How many of them can
    really get away with it?

08:02.749 --> 08:05.150
     Get away with getting
     away from themselves.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.733
  How do you get away with it?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.556
          Hello again.

09:20.827 --> 09:21.893
        I remember you.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.129
          Each of you.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.032
      But I wish I didn't.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.069
    There's just so much, so
  much in these silly things.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.639
      Clothes seem silly,
       but they really do

09:34.641 --> 09:37.309
      hold so much power,
        so much memory.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.212
   I'm holding parts of him.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.581
     I'm holding him again.

09:44.251 --> 09:49.321
   I know I shouldn't be, but
  I just know I have to hold,

09:49.656 --> 09:51.256
       I have to hold him
       to feel him again.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
         I have to feel
      parts of him again.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.965
  I just wanna know him again.

11:56.149 --> 12:00.051
 (camera beeping and clicking)

12:20.207 --> 12:23.108
       (camera clicking)

12:24.878 --> 12:27.779
       (camera clicking)

12:37.224 --> 12:39.524
  - [Toby] You don't trust me?

12:39.526 --> 12:41.126
       - [Helen] I don't
        know, should I?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.228
              Yes.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.151
        ¶ All I desire I
      threw in the fire ¶

13:06.153 --> 13:10.221
   - Oh, thanks, I appreciate
     your foot. (laughing)

13:10.223 --> 13:15.160
      ¶ See how it burns ¶

13:15.162 --> 13:17.428
     ¶ Leaves of the trees
      assemble me please ¶

13:17.430 --> 13:19.831
           (laughing)

13:19.833 --> 13:21.266
       - [Toby] You know
      what my grandmother

13:21.268 --> 13:22.867
    used to make my dad do?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.135
        - [Helen] What?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.871
       - She used to make
       him wax her back.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.106
        - [Helen] What?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.575
    - He'd get, like, those
     little icicle sticks.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.478
      You know, like those
       icicle pop sticks

13:33.480 --> 13:36.080
  and dip it into the, like...

13:36.082 --> 13:38.316
       Anyway, now he has
      two sons, you know,

13:38.318 --> 13:41.186
      so he's like, okay,
     I'm gonna go to work.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.320
        You can hang out
       with grandmother,

13:42.322 --> 13:44.189
you know, your mother's working,

13:44.991 --> 13:47.192
 and do whatever she tells you.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.177
            So okay.

13:49.178 --> 13:51.161
  So my grandma, like, took us
   upstairs and she lied down

13:51.164 --> 13:54.232
     on this, like, table,
   this, like, massage table.

13:54.234 --> 13:58.937
    And she brings out this,
   like, pink gelatin stuff,

13:58.939 --> 14:01.139
   and took out one of those
      icicle pop scoopers.

14:01.141 --> 14:05.043
      And she said, okay,
     now dip this in there,

14:05.045 --> 14:07.212
      and we had to, like,
        dip it in there

14:07.214 --> 14:09.848
       and wipe it, smear
     it all over her back.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.451
     And then we'd have to,
      like, wax her back.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.670
      - (laughing) That's
       really fucked up.

14:15.671 --> 14:17.888
  - Yeah, we had to let it dry
  off, and then we'd have to,

14:17.891 --> 14:20.558
      she's like, rip it,
       just, just rip it!

14:21.461 --> 14:24.062
        - Thank you for
     telling me that story.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.096
        I appreciate it.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.032
      - [Toby] Do you have
     any intimate stories?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.302
      - [Helen] Do I have
     any intimate stories?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.136
         - [Toby] Yeah.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.138
    - Not as good as yours.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.907
      This is gonna sound
         really stupid.

14:36.610 --> 14:37.976
     - It's okay, go ahead.

14:39.546 --> 14:44.616
  - Um, I started junior high,
  whatever, what is that, uh?

14:45.151 --> 14:46.017
        - Middle school?

14:46.019 --> 14:46.618
        - Middle school.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.522
    And this group of girls
  decided that they were gonna

14:51.524 --> 14:56.527
 pick on me because I talked to
 their boyfriends or whatever.

14:58.498 --> 15:02.634
      I was just trying to
   make friends or whatever.

15:04.371 --> 15:09.440
        And, uh, one day
      after school one of

15:11.544 --> 15:14.345
the girls started to beat me up.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.547
      She, like, threw me
      against a trash can.

15:18.151 --> 15:21.419
  I didn't understand why she
  did it, but she just did it.

15:28.194 --> 15:32.964
   That's the stupidest story
  ever, but it was fucked up.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.234
  - Well, I have a confession.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.440
        - [Helen] What?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.208
    - My grandmother really
  didn't make us wax her back,

15:44.210 --> 15:46.444
   I was just kidding around.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.110
           (mumbling)

16:34.027 --> 16:35.126
           Trust me?

16:35.128 --> 16:36.027
             - Yes.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.163
           (laughing)

16:39.165 --> 16:42.200
      I often think about
        where he is now.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.469
          (rock music)

17:40.293 --> 17:43.261
       (glass shattering)

17:51.838 --> 17:52.737
            Oh fuck.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.233
           (grunting)

18:22.235 --> 18:23.434
      (breathing heavily)

18:23.436 --> 18:25.236
    I no longer had control.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.672
    My body no longer mine.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.115
             - Hey.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.218
           (whining)

18:40.220 --> 18:41.319
  Are you alright over there?

18:45.558 --> 18:48.593
       I can get you some
       water if you want.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.597
       It's still early.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.608
           You okay?

19:03.610 --> 19:04.509
            - Mmhmm.

19:07.881 --> 19:08.779
           - I, um...

19:11.484 --> 19:12.617
     I had fun last night.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.320
  I didn't expect you to call.

19:16.322 --> 19:20.324
       I mean, it's been,
       it's been a while.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.225
             - Mmm.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.431
- Hey, you sure you're alright?

19:27.433 --> 19:29.600
      - Mmhmm, I'm great.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.604
     - It's a little early,
        don't you think?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.808
           (laughing)

19:39.512 --> 19:40.444
             - Woo!

19:40.446 --> 19:41.612
           (laughing)

19:41.614 --> 19:42.680
           Right on.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.183
           Fun times.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.587
             - Hey.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.924
           (groaning)

19:58.865 --> 20:00.698
       So last night when
      you're drunk you can

20:00.700 --> 20:03.568
       tell me all those
    things, I can kiss you?

20:03.570 --> 20:06.671
      This morning, you're
        close to sober,

20:06.673 --> 20:08.272
I can't do any of those things?

20:08.274 --> 20:10.441
           (mumbling)

20:10.443 --> 20:11.576
        - What was that?

20:11.578 --> 20:12.610
           (mumbling)

20:12.612 --> 20:14.245
- Yeah, I'll give you a second.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.282
             Well?

20:20.720 --> 20:21.619
            - What?

20:23.523 --> 20:24.455
            - What?

20:24.457 --> 20:25.356
            - Mhmm.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.495
    - Maybe you should stop
   drinking for the morning.

20:31.497 --> 20:34.432
       - (grunting) Mhmm.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.835
 - Seriously, are you alright?

20:41.608 --> 20:43.274
          - I'm fine.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.941
   Okay, keys by your table.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.579
      See you later, it's
        good to see you.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.682
         You look good.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.321
           - Thanks.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.695
             - Bye.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.403
           - Alright.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.875
           - Bye now.

21:17.877 --> 21:22.613
            Bye-bye.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.882
            Bye now.

21:24.884 --> 21:25.783
              Bye.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.786
          Bye-bye-bye.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.056
      See you later, bye.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.326
     It's good seeing you.

21:42.702 --> 21:47.738
           (retching)
       (water splashing)

21:54.714 --> 21:56.414
           (grunting)

21:56.416 --> 21:59.483
      (breathing heavily)

22:04.691 --> 22:06.824
            (crying)

22:13.099 --> 22:16.000
       (toilet flushing)

22:18.871 --> 22:21.806
        (wood creaking)

22:28.614 --> 22:30.915
           (coughing)

22:54.474 --> 22:55.406
         Can you stop?

22:55.408 --> 22:56.140
             Stop!

22:57.677 --> 22:58.843
    - [Toby] Get outta bed.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.112
             - No.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.616
    I will in a little bit.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.550
            Just go.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.818
   Do whatever you gotta do.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.855
     I'm just gonna take a
     nap, I'm really tired.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.729
        (wood creaking)

23:28.708 --> 23:30.808
        - [Toby] Who are
      you thinking about?

23:30.810 --> 23:31.909
            - What?

23:31.910 --> 23:33.009
        - [Toby] Who are
      you thinking about?

23:33.012 --> 23:34.445
       - I'm not thinking
         about anybody.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.151
      - [Toby] Look at me.

23:44.690 --> 23:45.940
   I know you're not eating,

23:45.941 --> 23:47.191
      but you still gotta
       brush your teeth.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.529
         - I brushed my
      teeth this morning.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.732
     - [Toby] When was the
    last time you showered?

23:56.536 --> 23:57.568
      - I showered today.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.536
    - [Toby] No, you didn't.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.005
         - Yes, I did.

24:01.006 --> 24:03.473
  - [Toby] I bought a new bar
of soap, you didn't use it. It's
     still in the wrapper.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.476
  - I didn't use soap, I just
  showered without using soap.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.844
      So what, it's water,
      it's the same thing.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.913
       - [Toby] You know
       the sun's outside?

24:11.617 --> 24:12.583
      The sun is shining.

24:17.757 --> 24:18.956
            - Great.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.091
  I'm glad the sun is shining.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.560
        - [Toby] Who are
      you thinking about?

24:22.562 --> 24:23.194
   - I'm not thinking about..

24:23.196 --> 24:25.930
        (wood creaking)

24:27.800 --> 24:29.066
        - [Toby] Who are
      you thinking about?

24:29.068 --> 24:32.203
       - Nothing. I'm not
       thinking about...

24:32.205 --> 24:33.904
            - Stop.

24:33.906 --> 24:38.976
             Stop!

24:40.012 --> 24:41.612
              Hey.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.746
         Can you stop?

24:43.583 --> 24:44.482
            Stop it!

24:48.154 --> 24:51.755
  (answering machine beeping)

24:51.757 --> 24:53.557
   - [Georgia] Hey, it's me.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.495
      You have to get out
      at least once today.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.796
       It is not healthy
       to stay in there.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.030
 Just get out there for a bit.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.799
          Take a walk.

25:01.801 --> 25:02.700
           Anywhere.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.636
  I'm here if you wanna talk.

25:06.973 --> 25:07.905
        (phone clicking)

25:07.907 --> 25:09.640
  (answering machine beeping)

25:09.642 --> 25:13.644
¶ I don't sound so out of key ¶

25:13.646 --> 25:18.716
   ¶ Though it's been a while
  since you've thought of me ¶

25:19.185 --> 25:20.818
        ¶ That's okay ¶

25:20.820 --> 25:21.785
          - Oh, fuck.

25:21.787 --> 25:26.724
 ¶ I don't take it personally ¶

25:27.793 --> 25:31.295
       ¶ Cause I've been
     working on the farm ¶

25:31.297 --> 25:36.567
¶ I use my back, I use my arms ¶

25:37.737 --> 25:42.106
    ¶ I think this crop will
     turn out beautifully ¶

25:43.976 --> 25:48.078
      ¶ But I keep one eye
      on the city lights ¶

25:48.080 --> 25:53.150
    ¶ And I see you there in
    your heels and tights ¶

25:53.853 --> 25:56.987
     ¶ And your top hats ¶

25:56.989 --> 25:59.890
       (heavy breathing)

26:01.861 --> 26:05.996
  ¶ Cause there's a wind that
  blows through now and then ¶

26:05.998 --> 26:11.068
       ¶ That says I may
     never see you again ¶

26:12.872 --> 26:17.942
      ¶ I lean on my hoe,
      almost desperately ¶

26:19.979 --> 26:25.049
       ¶ But I'll be here
   through the winter storm ¶

26:26.619 --> 26:28.085
        - [Georgia] Keep
        your voice down.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.253
      Helen will hear us.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.823
         She can't know
      anything about this.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.259
Because she needs to feel safe.

26:35.261 --> 26:39.029
      She can't know, know
      what you did to me!

26:43.636 --> 26:45.269
  You know what you did to me!

26:45.270 --> 26:46.903
   You made me, I didn't want
    a child, I was a child!

26:46.906 --> 26:51.976
     ¶ Give you all I had ¶

26:54.013 --> 26:58.916
       ¶ No one should've
     treated you so badly ¶

27:08.961 --> 27:13.163
      ¶ Then like a dream
       you disappeared ¶

27:14.100 --> 27:16.767
 - I didn't stop trusting men.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.136
     I just started to see
    them for what they were.

27:20.706 --> 27:23.073
   I still didn't understand
     how I felt about him.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.309
     Maybe one day I will.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.912
     Maybe one day I won't.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.673
   (upbeat melancholic music)

34:06.678 --> 34:11.748
           Oh, fuck.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.844
        (keys jingling)

34:43.415 --> 34:46.483
      (breathing heavily)

35:37.469 --> 35:39.436
  (answering machine beeping)

35:39.438 --> 35:41.171
       - [Georgia] I just
         want you to...

35:42.474 --> 35:46.877
    I just want you to know
    that I'm, I'm really...

35:50.516 --> 35:52.849
        Okay, I get it.

35:54.419 --> 35:58.522
   Call me, don't call me, do
    whatever you like Helen.

35:58.524 --> 36:02.559
    ¶ I threw in the fire ¶

36:02.561 --> 36:07.631
      ¶ See how it burns ¶

36:08.767 --> 36:12.802
     ¶ Leaves of the trees
      assemble me please ¶

36:14.273 --> 36:19.342
       ¶ With these words
         I've learned ¶

36:20.579 --> 36:24.414
    ¶ Help me to stand where
   there once was quicksand ¶

36:25.484 --> 36:30.554
   ¶ Now the current's fast ¶

36:32.191 --> 36:35.592
   ¶ And if you cast a spell,
  cast it well, cast it well ¶

36:36.795 --> 36:40.864
    ¶ And don't look back ¶

36:40.866 --> 36:44.301
    ¶ No, don't look back ¶

37:08.794 --> 37:13.863
    ¶ Time has had its hand
      on the pulse of me ¶

37:15.267 --> 37:20.337
    ¶ So I'm taking it off ¶

37:21.473 --> 37:25.508
      ¶ And oh, I wanna be
     down in New Orleans ¶

37:26.545 --> 37:31.681
   ¶ In the heart of it all ¶

37:31.683 --> 37:36.753
    ¶ So take me for a dance
   baby, put me in a trance ¶

37:37.923 --> 37:42.993
    ¶ I like it like that ¶

37:44.630 --> 37:47.998
  ¶ And sing me another song,
  make it long, make it long ¶

37:49.368 --> 37:53.370
    ¶ And don't look back ¶

37:53.372 --> 37:57.574
    ¶ No, don't look back ¶

37:57.576 --> 38:01.611
    ¶ And don't look back ¶

38:01.613 --> 38:04.648
    ¶ No, don't look back ¶

38:06.051 --> 38:08.952
       (camera clicking)

38:11.823 --> 38:12.722
         - Do you mind?

38:13.759 --> 38:14.691
            - What?

38:14.693 --> 38:16.059
  What do you mean, do I mind?

38:16.061 --> 38:17.627
     - If I take a picture?

38:17.629 --> 38:18.561
            - Of me?

38:18.563 --> 38:20.697
You wanna take a picture of me?

38:20.699 --> 38:21.865
            - I do.

38:21.867 --> 38:22.766
           - Oh boy.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.936
   - Photographers never like
   to get their photo taken.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.972
   - This is true. (laughing)

38:28.974 --> 38:30.573
        - [Man] Is that
       the case with you?

38:33.445 --> 38:35.312
      I hate my photograph
          being taken.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.014
       (camera clicking)

38:43.689 --> 38:44.788
     Could you look at me?

38:44.790 --> 38:47.691
           (sighing)

38:47.693 --> 38:49.626
        Just like that.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.094
       (camera clicking)

38:51.096 --> 38:53.063
      It's weird being on
     the other side, right?

38:53.065 --> 38:55.065
        - [Helen] Mhmm.

38:55.067 --> 38:57.967
       (camera clicking)

38:59.771 --> 39:01.538
 - Let's do one more like that.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.811
     Can you tilt your chin
     up just a little bit?

39:11.783 --> 39:14.684
       (camera clicking)

39:22.894 --> 39:23.793
          Look to me.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.465
       (camera clicking)

39:28.467 --> 39:30.033
   I feel like you never let
  people take pictures of you.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.535
           (laughing)

39:33.705 --> 39:35.405
  - [Helen] Yeah, once before.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.742
     - [Man] Who were they?

39:39.644 --> 39:41.111
- [Helen] None of your business.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.013
      - [Man] Fair enough.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.916
       (camera clicking)

39:50.389 --> 39:51.087
           You okay?

39:53.558 --> 39:54.457
            - Mhmm.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.669
       (camera clicking)

40:06.671 --> 40:09.172
 - It's like a thing of power.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.078
       Because we're safe
      behind this camera.

40:19.484 --> 40:22.185
       (camera clicking)

40:24.556 --> 40:25.455
            - Okay.

40:27.692 --> 40:29.592
     I'm done, let's stop.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.829
       - We only have two
      more shots on this.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.097
       Want to finish it?

40:34.099 --> 40:35.532
    - [Helen] No, I'm great.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.434
         Let's not take
       any more pictures.

40:38.737 --> 40:39.836
       - [Man] You sure?

40:40.806 --> 40:42.005
       - Yeah, positive.

40:46.111 --> 40:46.576
         - [Man] Okay.

40:46.577 --> 40:47.042
  Are you sure you're alright?

40:47.045 --> 40:48.178
       - (sniffing) Yeah.

40:50.549 --> 40:51.614
  - [Man] Did I say something?

40:53.819 --> 40:55.084
 - No, you didn't say anything.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.120
          You're fine.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.857
    - I didn't mean to make
    you feel uncomfortable.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.730
 You don't wanna shoot me now?

41:09.234 --> 41:10.834
        - I will, later.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.878
      - What's the matter?

41:22.848 --> 41:23.813
           - Nothing.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.914
           I'm fine.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.517
     - [Man] Are you sure?

41:27.519 --> 41:28.718
             - Yes!

41:28.720 --> 41:29.919
  What's the matter with you?

41:33.492 --> 41:34.757
     - Usually, when people
       say they're fine,

41:34.759 --> 41:35.825
      they're usually not.

42:18.169 --> 42:20.069
     - Hey honey, why don't
      you come over here?

42:20.071 --> 42:21.738
 It's a little cold over there.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.075
   Come on, take a load off.

42:30.282 --> 42:32.148
    Come on, it's freezing,
         get over here.

42:34.553 --> 42:35.251
           You okay?

42:38.757 --> 42:40.890
      Here, why don't you
       have some of this?

42:40.892 --> 42:41.925
      Come on, it's warm.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.161
     Come on, I don't have
     any cooties, go ahead.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.972
         Drink up, have
      some more, come on.

43:01.846 --> 43:02.745
           You okay?

43:12.257 --> 43:13.273
    It's cold out here, huh?

43:13.274 --> 43:14.290
        I wonder when my
     fucking bus is coming?

43:18.630 --> 43:19.862
    You been out here long?

43:24.636 --> 43:26.369
       Now if I take off
       when my bus comes

43:26.371 --> 43:27.937
 are you gonna be alright here?

43:29.274 --> 43:30.873
  Think you're gonna be okay?

43:36.281 --> 43:38.247
     Everything's gonna be
      alright, sweetheart.

43:41.620 --> 43:44.287
      The lady at the bus
    stop told you that, huh?

43:45.890 --> 43:48.358
         (upbeat music)

43:53.665 --> 43:56.232
        (shaver buzzing)

44:46.418 --> 44:47.316
            - Toby.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.286
       Toby was his name.

44:51.222 --> 44:53.723
  The guy who changed it all.

44:53.725 --> 44:54.691
   This is what he was like.

44:54.693 --> 44:55.391
           He was...

44:56.995 --> 44:58.461
           (laughing)

44:58.463 --> 45:02.031
     When we first met, he
   sort of, he sort of spoke,

45:02.033 --> 45:04.734
  he sort of spoke like this.

45:11.242 --> 45:14.277
   I have to get him, I have
  to get him completely right.

45:19.150 --> 45:20.049
          He would...

45:23.888 --> 45:26.189
 He would move kinda like this.

45:30.995 --> 45:34.063
     Okay, I have to become
     him, exactly him. So.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.086
His shirts were always wrinkled.

45:58.523 --> 46:00.223
 He was such a beautiful mess.

46:42.901 --> 46:45.434
        (steam hissing)

47:04.989 --> 47:07.023
        I didn't really
       wanna hurt myself.

47:08.193 --> 47:10.159
      It was just a go at
       feeling something.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.129
     Just anything at all.

47:28.947 --> 47:34.016
    Your eyes, I can't look
      away from your eyes.

47:37.121 --> 47:38.287
   You have a story to tell.

47:40.225 --> 47:41.190
        I must know you.

47:43.127 --> 47:44.260
        I must hear you.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.129
        I know you have
       something to say.

48:13.992 --> 48:18.194
       I used to look at
     you and see my heart.

48:20.198 --> 48:21.631
      Now you disgust me.

48:24.168 --> 48:28.371
         You're just a
      little, weak woman,

48:30.608 --> 48:32.308
and I have no time for weakness.

48:44.055 --> 48:45.321
  That's what he sounded like.

48:46.424 --> 48:49.225
 An artist, a poet, a thinker.

48:49.227 --> 48:51.327
           (laughing)

49:01.272 --> 49:03.706
         You're just a
      little, weak woman,

49:03.708 --> 49:06.375
and I have no time for weakness.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.951
        (fire crackling)

50:34.399 --> 50:39.435
        ¶ All I desire I
      threw in the fire ¶

50:40.304 --> 50:45.541
      ¶ See how it burns ¶

50:46.511 --> 50:50.546
     ¶ Leaves of the trees
      assemble me please ¶

50:51.716 --> 50:56.619
       ¶ With these words
         I've learned ¶

50:58.256 --> 51:02.124
  ¶ And help me to stand where
   there once was quicksand ¶

51:03.094 --> 51:08.164
   ¶ Now the current's fast ¶

51:09.400 --> 51:13.402
   ¶ And if you cast a spell,
  cast it well, cast it well ¶

51:14.405 --> 51:18.474
    ¶ And don't look back ¶

51:18.476 --> 51:21.510
    ¶ No, don't look back ¶

51:46.571 --> 51:50.506
    ¶ Time has had its hand
      on the pulse of me ¶

51:50.508 --> 51:53.476
       (plastic rattling)

51:57.748 --> 51:59.448
   - It was too much to bear,

52:00.751 --> 52:03.619
    seeing herself reflected
     in every passing face.

52:09.227 --> 52:11.827
        I wonder if any
       one of them hide?

52:13.564 --> 52:15.464
       If any one of them
      can really get away

52:15.466 --> 52:17.500
       with getting away
        from themselves.

52:25.476 --> 52:28.277
         Just walking,
     walking, and walking,

52:28.279 --> 52:30.446
          walking, and
     walking, and walking.

52:32.150 --> 52:35.551
      Continuously walking
         into nothing,

52:35.553 --> 52:37.786
  into nothing, into nothing.

53:06.450 --> 53:07.883
    - I was like you, once,

53:11.455 --> 53:12.621
   but then I found my armor.

53:24.468 --> 53:26.535
 I couldn't see my reflection.

53:28.272 --> 53:30.639
     I didn't like the way
      people looked at me.

53:32.476 --> 53:34.577
       I didn't like the
     way men looked at me.

53:38.482 --> 53:40.516
       I didn't like what
        they did to me.

53:44.822 --> 53:46.889
    But now I feel powerful.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.766
       I guess we'll see
     what happens with you.

54:12.917 --> 54:16.885
 (traffic rumbling and honking)

54:58.996 --> 55:02.364

56:45.002 --> 56:46.769
  (answering machine beeping)

56:46.771 --> 56:49.438
    - [Georgia] Just calling
    because it's Christmas.

56:51.709 --> 56:52.875
   Your Daddy and I miss you.

56:56.414 --> 57:01.483
    ¶ And the auld triangle

57:21.839 --> 57:22.938
             Usual?

57:23.741 --> 57:24.640
            - Mhmm.

57:44.228 --> 57:45.127
            Cheers!

57:46.497 --> 57:47.196
            Cheers!

57:49.767 --> 57:50.732
            Cheers!

57:50.734 --> 57:53.735
- Why are you in fucking silver?

57:53.737 --> 57:56.004
           (laughing)

58:05.816 --> 58:06.882
          Fair enough.

58:13.724 --> 58:14.556
            - Want.

58:14.558 --> 58:17.493
       (glass shattering)

58:17.495 --> 58:18.794
        On me, next one.

58:20.598 --> 58:22.931
         I will pay for
      that, I promise you.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.268
      - I think you've had
       enough, don't you?

58:28.639 --> 58:29.538
        - I don't know.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.876
           I'm fine.

58:33.878 --> 58:35.077
       - [Karl] Last one.

58:35.079 --> 58:38.914
            - Karl.

58:38.916 --> 58:42.017
        Karl, thank you.

58:43.821 --> 58:44.920
           Thank you.

58:45.756 --> 58:47.689
 Thank you for being my friend.

58:47.691 --> 58:48.857
     - [Karl] Always, love.

58:51.929 --> 58:52.928
           - Cheers.

58:52.930 --> 58:54.162
        - [Karl] Cheers.

58:54.164 --> 58:55.731
      - Fuck do you think
       you're looking at?

58:59.970 --> 59:02.170
     Karl, you look really
       really good today.

59:04.208 --> 59:07.009
   I've never seen you quite
     that sharp in my life.

59:07.912 --> 59:08.977
          - Thank you.

59:10.014 --> 59:11.747
        Are you alright?

59:11.749 --> 59:13.315
- Will you sing me a song again?

    ¶ And the auld triangle

    so good, you're so good.

59:40.945 --> 59:43.111
   Get it the fuck together.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.746
  I'm not gonna go back there.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.915
     I'm not gonna go back
  there where I was with him.

59:54.124 --> 59:55.741
  (answering machine beeping)

59:55.742 --> 59:57.359
     - [Georgia] I know you
    want me to stop trying,

59:57.361 --> 59:58.994
       but I won't, okay?

59:59.897 --> 01:00:01.096
     I'm not angry anymore.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.288
     - I don't have to feel
   sorry for myself anymore.

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:36.264
        (phone ringing)

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:47.142
             Mama?

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:58.420
       (knocking on door)

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:06.928
       - My little girl.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.196
  Come here, you've come back.

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:12.034
           (laughing)

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:13.135
          Look at you.

01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:18.040
 Look at you, you've grown up!

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.107
          Look at you.

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:27.349
 - Why, why didn't you tell me?

01:01:29.953 --> 01:01:31.753
- Let's go have some tea, yeah?

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:07.255
         He's not here.

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:12.060
              Tea?

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.130
          - Thank you.

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:16.431
       - You're welcome.

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:23.939
      You wanna sit down?

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:26.441
            - Yeah.

01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:29.144
   - I'm so happy to see you.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:33.148
       What is it that's
       brought you home?

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.451
  - I just wanted to see you.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:37.919
    - Is everything alright?

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:41.890
       - Yeah, I mean, I
       mean, it will be.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.392
  - Well, that makes me happy.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:46.027
   That makes me very happy.

01:02:48.499 --> 01:02:50.065
      - I think I'm gonna
       go get some sleep.

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:51.066
       I'm really tired.

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:53.201
        - Okay, darlin'.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.873
       Look, I'm sorry I
        didn't tell you.

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.244
          - It's okay.

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:05.013
          - I just...

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:13.008
        (peaceful music)

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:29.024
        (peaceful music)

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.033
        (rain pattering)

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:40.035
   - [Alfred] And that's not
   the reason, Miss Thompson.

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:42.037
     What is the reason you
   don't wanna go back there?

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:42.971
        - I've told you!

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:44.239
   - No, you haven't told me.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.309
     - Well, it's this way.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.229
 I'm trying to go straight now,

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:52.147
     and if I go back there
      I can't go straight.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:53.348
      - What will prevent
         you from going

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:54.783
straight if you really want to?

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.217
      - There's a man back
    there that won't let me.

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:57.519
    - Why won't he let you?

01:05:58.522 --> 01:06:00.255
        - He just won't.

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:02.157
    You see, it's this way.

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:05.260
 I'm scared he'll get me again.

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:06.361
       - Who is this man?

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:09.097
    - Sort of a politician.

01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:10.031
         - Hmm, I see.

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:11.333
And you fear his influence, eh?

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:12.734
    - Yeah, yeah, that's it.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:15.670
     You see, he's bad and
       I'm scared of him.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:18.006
   - [Alfred] Does he need to
  know that you have returned?

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:20.058
   - [Sadie] Oh, he'll know.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.109
   - [Alfred] Miss Thompson,
 San Francisco is a big place.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.678
        It should not be
       difficult for you

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.613
       to keep out of his
      way if you want to.

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.082
      - [Sadie] Well, I'll
        have to get help

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:28.650
        once I get back,
      and the only people

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.285
that'll help me are in with him.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.387
  - [Alfred] If you earnestly
     desire to go straight

01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:33.755
         it will not be
    necessary for you to go

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.757
to your former friends for help.

01:06:35.759 --> 01:06:38.626
  My foundation will help you
  until you are on your feet.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:41.229
  This man you fear need never
   know you are in the city.

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:42.848
   - [Sadie] Oh, he'll know.

01:06:42.849 --> 01:06:44.466
      All the boats coming
     in are being watched.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.434
        - You mean tell
       me that every boat

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:47.502
coming into port will be watched

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.437
       on the chance that
         you are on it?

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:52.440
             - Yes.

01:06:52.442 --> 01:06:55.410
        (steps thumping)

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.380
            - Mama?

01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.514
        - Yes, darling?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:00.415
         - Where is he?

01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:05.653
     - Your father is out.

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:14.462
    - It's still, it's still
  exactly the same, isn't it?

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.367
       He hasn't changed
        at all, has he?

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.468
     - I love your father.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:22.670
        He's a good man.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.372
     He's a very good man.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.408
 - Are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.343
      You're gonna try to
    get me to believe that?

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:31.379
         - It's always
   complicated, Helen, okay?

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:35.250
- No, Mom, it isn't complicated.

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:37.485
        It doesn't have
       to be complicated.

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:42.157
     How can you love him?

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:43.458
  How can you love a monster?

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.627
 - Your father's not a monster.

01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:47.529
   - I heard you two talking.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:49.097
 - What are you talking about?

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:51.499
       - You know exactly
    what I'm talking about!

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.268
    - Stop getting so upset.

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.870
    What are talking about?

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.471
     I don't have any idea
   what you're talking about.

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:57.405
     - You didn't want me.

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:04.646
    You didn't, you didn't,
    you didn't want me, Mom.

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:06.581
            - What?

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:10.118
   - He, he made you have me.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:13.321
      You didn't want me.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:14.489
     - I always wanted you.

01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:16.457
Don't say that, that's not true.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:18.827
            - Yeah.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:21.696
   You know, I had something.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.430
          I had love.

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:26.568
     I mean, I don't know,
     I guess, I don't know.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.636
      I think it was love,
      but it wasn't love.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:32.841
      I don't know, 'cause
      it was forced on me.

01:08:32.843 --> 01:08:33.640
        - What happened?

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:34.475
     What happened to you?

01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:35.861
       - The same thing!

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.245
      The same thing that
        happened to you.

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.180
      - But no, the thing
      that happened to me,

01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:41.850
        that is not what
        happened to you.

01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:44.185
       Helen, that is not
        the same thing!

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.656
  Helen, did you tell someone?

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:51.326
       - I'm telling you,
      I'm telling you now.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:53.795
     I'm telling you, Mom.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.229
          - I'm sorry.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:58.600
      Helen, I am so sorry
     that happened to you.

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:05.173
    - Everything is not just
  fine because he says it is.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.921
          (screaming)

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.903
 This is what really happened.

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:14.209
          He raped me.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:20.982
        He raped me, and
        then he left me,

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:23.318
        like a shot down
       animal, for dead.

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:39.567
           (giggling)

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:36.491
           (giggling)

01:11:53.743 --> 01:11:55.810
           (giggling)

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:13.755
         Can you stop?

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:14.689
              No.

01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:15.790
          Okay, stop.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.659
   Okay, what are you doing?

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:22.697
       Okay, um, nuh-uh.

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:25.166
      Stop, stop, nuh-uh.

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:27.602
   Stop it, stop it, stop it!

01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:31.539
          (whimpering)

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:37.145
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:37.979
              No!

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.647
      (muffled screaming)

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:40.681
            Stop it!

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:42.150
            Stop it!

01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:45.420
      (muffled screaming)

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:55.696
       (heavy breathing)

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:18.913
    What the fuck happened?

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.824
    What the fuck happened?

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.126
             - Hmm?

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:43.938
             What?

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:48.109
       - You know exactly
    what I'm talking about.

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:54.982
      - What's the matter?

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.686
         - Stop, stop.

01:15:58.688 --> 01:15:59.587
            - What?

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:01.689
         What's wrong?

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:07.562
         What's wrong?

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:09.964
           - Get out.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:19.273
         Please leave.

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:26.981
             Leave.

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:27.882
             - Why?

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:30.851
              Why?

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:31.953
            - Leave.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:34.855
            - Leave?

01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:35.957
            - Leave!

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.025
             - Why?

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:46.133
             What?

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:48.603
            - Stop.

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:50.972
            Get out!

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:55.610
   - [Toby] Did you forget to
  take your meds or something?

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:57.078
  What's the matter with you?

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:01.616
              Huh?

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:02.650
           - Get out.

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:04.018
    - [Toby] What did I do?

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.853
- You know exactly what you did.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:06.687
     - [Toby] No, I don't.

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:07.622
         What did I do?

01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:10.057
- You know exactly what you did.

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:11.993
            Get out.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:21.335
        - [Toby] So what
       are you gonna do?

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:23.004
       What are you gonna
         say to people?

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:25.673
              Huh?

01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:26.907
    What are you gonna say?

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:29.010
    Who's gonna believe you?

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:35.950
           - Get out!

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:37.351
   Get out, get out, get out!

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:38.252
           Fuck you!

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:48.195
- [Toby] This is your own fault.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:50.998
         You did this.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:55.770
   So you gotta get your act
   together, you understand?

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:06.914
    You make these baseless
   accusations of me, right?

01:18:16.426 --> 01:18:19.160
        (door slamming)

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.091
   It doesn't matter anymore.

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:54.161
       I've gone through
      all of it again now.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:00.201
       And now I'm alone.

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:07.174
   Trauma is a time machine.

01:19:09.312 --> 01:19:10.478
         I believe me.

01:19:12.515 --> 01:19:13.881
         I believe me.

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:44.145
             ¶ Ah ¶

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:56.023
             ¶ Ah ¶

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:11.138
    ¶ I see you everywhere,
    I hear you in my head ¶

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:23.083
    ¶ I see you everywhere,
    I hear you in my head ¶

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:34.094
         ¶ In our bed ¶

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:39.934
         ¶ In our bed ¶

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:46.407
         ¶ In our bed ¶

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:51.946
         ¶ In our bed ¶

01:20:56.252 --> 01:21:04.358
     ¶ I cannot remember my
     fragmented memories ¶

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.196
      ¶ Are all around in
      my head, in our bed¶

01:21:18.007 --> 01:21:23.077
         ¶ In my head ¶

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:29.283
         ¶ In my head ¶

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:35.322
         ¶ In my head ¶

01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:41.528
         ¶ In my head ¶

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:47.201
         ¶ In my head ¶

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:50.938
         ¶ In my head ¶
