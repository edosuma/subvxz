evalos.

04:29.158 --> 04:31.072
District Attorney Devalos.

04:32.319 --> 04:34.098
No, no. I know he's not at work
yet, that's why I'm calling you.

04:34.098 --> 04:35.277
That's why I'm asking
for his home number.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.543
No, please don't
put me on...

04:38.090 --> 04:39.397
hold.
Hey!

04:39.397 --> 04:41.500
There's only four Heart-a-Bear
cards in here.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.234
Daddy!
Hold on, Bridge.

04:43.818 --> 04:45.606
Uh, nature of my business?

04:45.606 --> 04:47.320
My wife works for him.
She works in that office.

04:48.863 --> 04:49.964
I really need to speak with him.

04:51.605 --> 04:52.623
Yes, of course, I'll hold again.

04:53.220 --> 04:54.730
Where is my hair scrunchie

04:55.398 --> 04:57.209
and where's Mommy?

04:58.231 --> 04:59.152
Uh, Mom--

04:59.661 --> 05:01.384
Mom had to go in
to work early today.

05:01.989 --> 05:04.641
Yeah, no, I know it's
an unlisted number.

05:04.641 --> 05:07.103
That's... I have it
here somewhere,

05:07.103 --> 05:07.890
I just can't find it.

05:08.470 --> 05:09.860
Daddy, is something going on?

05:09.860 --> 05:11.727
You're acting like
something's going on.

05:11.727 --> 05:13.500
Huh? No, sweetie,
everything's fine.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.638
Nothing's going on. Daddy's just
looking for a number.

05:16.666 --> 05:17.923
Uh, help your sister
with her, uh...

05:17.923 --> 05:19.489
stuff. I'll be
right with you.

05:20.592 --> 05:22.235
Why are yodoing
this in the kitchen?

05:22.235 --> 05:24.548
You're going to get food
all over everything.

05:24.548 --> 05:25.912
I have to get finished.

05:25.912 --> 05:27.936
I have seven boyfriends
this year.

05:27.936 --> 05:30.772
And that's a lot of cards.
Valentine's Day

05:30.772 --> 05:32.189
is a manufactured
holiday invented

05:32.189 --> 05:33.737
by greeting card companies

05:33.737 --> 05:34.947
to trick dumb
third graders

05:34.947 --> 05:37.222
into buying Heart-a-Bear cards.

05:37.690 --> 05:38.716
That's a lie!

05:39.192 --> 05:40.349
Bridge, hold on. I can't hear.

05:41.449 --> 05:43.565
Yeah. Yes, it's an emergency,

05:43.565 --> 05:46.129
but it's not a 911 emergency,
it's personal.

05:46.129 --> 05:47.880
Valentine's Day is real.

05:48.474 --> 05:50.832
Send a card to your friends
who are boys,

05:51.493 --> 05:52.856
and if you get one back

05:53.460 --> 05:55.039
they're your true love.

05:55.039 --> 05:57.106
Really? Your true love?

05:57.106 --> 05:58.381
Because he gives you a card?

05:58.756 --> 06:00.116
I don't think so.
You know what?

06:00.116 --> 06:02.327
Forget it. I found it.
Valentine's Day

06:02.327 --> 06:04.578
is for real.
Isn't it, Daddy?

06:04.578 --> 06:06.053
Yeah, Bridge. Of course, Bridge.

06:34.315 --> 06:36.014
Yeah, I got a call
from the D.A., told me you had

06:36.014 --> 06:37.642
a bit of a situation,
asked me to come by.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.601
Yeah, I appreciate
it, Detective.

06:39.601 --> 06:40.841
It's a little
crazy around here.

06:40.841 --> 06:41.695
Let's go on the patio.

06:42.554 --> 06:43.518
Hi, Detective Scanlon.

06:44.209 --> 06:45.203
Is my mom with you?

06:45.702 --> 06:47.977
No, honey, I'm
actually here to
see your Daddy.

06:47.977 --> 06:50.735
Daddy, is everything okay?
Everything's fine, pumpkin.

06:50.735 --> 06:52.394
Just look after your sister
for me for a second.

06:54.435 --> 06:56.695
We got an APB out
on your car, we got
the phone company

06:56.695 --> 06:58.857
monitoring your cell in case
she uses it to call somebody.

06:58.857 --> 07:00.461
At this point, it's really
just a matter of time.

07:01.683 --> 07:02.447
Okay.

07:03.711 --> 07:05.236
I gotta get the kids
to school, and act...

07:05.236 --> 07:06.871
act like nothing's happened.

07:07.474 --> 07:09.790
Uh, if you find her,
call me on Allison's cell?

07:09.790 --> 07:11.332
I'm gonna take that with me.
Sure.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.337
She was perfectly lucid, just...

07:17.164 --> 07:18.255
someone else.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.044
Look, get your kids to school.

07:23.044 --> 07:25.215
The second we locate her,
I'll call you.
All right.

07:25.918 --> 07:26.624
Tom?

07:30.249 --> 07:31.012
Tom?

07:33.673 --> 07:34.245
Dora?

07:34.245 --> 07:36.298
Es usted, Señora O'Bannon?

07:37.601 --> 07:38.931
Uh, yeah-- um...

07:39.545 --> 07:42.155
How the hell do you say,
"in the kitchen?"

07:42.920 --> 07:43.236
Uh...

07:43.742 --> 07:45.949
En lacocina, Dora!

07:47.248 --> 07:48.380
(speaking Spanish)

07:49.503 --> 07:52.273
(speaking Spanish)

07:52.318 --> 07:53.610
Slow down, Dora.

07:53.610 --> 07:56.467
I'm still learning here.
It's Spanish 101.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.435
What is it?
(speaking Spanish)

08:04.865 --> 08:05.563
Dora.

08:05.563 --> 08:06.690
What is it? What's happened?

08:07.356 --> 08:09.537
Policia, emergency.

08:09.537 --> 08:12.717
2323 Glendale Lane.

08:16.605 --> 08:17.593
Okay.

08:18.386 --> 08:19.558
Out, you two.

08:20.996 --> 08:21.743
Love you.

08:23.010 --> 08:23.549
Bye, Dad.

08:23.549 --> 08:24.920
Bye.
Love you, Dad.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.176
Hello?

08:35.885 --> 08:37.096
Told you it wouldn't take long.

08:41.943 --> 08:44.147
Two patrols responded to
a B&E on Glendale Lane.

08:44.783 --> 08:46.122
ID'd your car
in the driveway.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.997
She was breaking and entering?

08:48.713 --> 08:50.456
The maid found her in
the Missus' clothes

08:50.456 --> 08:51.637
eating ice cream
in the kitchen.

08:52.190 --> 08:54.191
What?
She was so convincing,

08:54.191 --> 08:56.996
the cops didn't know
who to arrest at first,
Allison or the maid.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.342
The maid could
produce ID.

09:02.312 --> 09:04.582
This woman, the one who's
clothes that she's wearing,

09:04.582 --> 09:06.383
she wouldn't happen to have
died recently, would she?

09:06.383 --> 09:07.562
First thing I checked.

09:08.826 --> 09:09.789
Very much alive.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.231
Can I talk to her?
Yeah.

09:17.555 --> 09:17.924
Have you

09:17.924 --> 09:18.984
called my husband yet?

09:18.984 --> 09:20.149
I sure did.

09:21.853 --> 09:22.848
You again!

09:23.467 --> 09:26.118
Officer, this is the man I was
telling you people about.

09:26.721 --> 09:28.795
He got me drunk. I don't know,
maybe even drugged me.

09:28.795 --> 09:30.912
Brought me back to his house,
then wouldn't let me leave.

09:30.912 --> 09:33.249
He has my purse,
my phone,

09:33.857 --> 09:35.532
my ID. Honestly.

09:35.532 --> 09:38.217
I don't know who to press
charges against first,

09:38.217 --> 09:40.308
him or that crazy housekeeper.

09:40.308 --> 09:42.074
Of course I can
always fire

09:42.074 --> 09:42.886
her ass.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.624
Unfortunately, degenerate
Mr. Mom over here

09:45.624 --> 09:46.844
doesn't work for me.

09:46.879 --> 09:47.600
Stop it.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.271
Excuse me, do you know
who you're speaking to?

09:50.271 --> 09:51.158
Enough!

09:54.070 --> 09:55.665
You can't do that.
You can't be that way.

09:56.275 --> 09:57.687
Not while you look like that.

09:57.687 --> 09:59.050
Not while you're...

10:00.192 --> 10:01.500
wearing my wife.

10:02.591 --> 10:05.006
He's a whack job.
You can see that,

10:05.006 --> 10:06.248
right?
I said enough!

10:08.508 --> 10:10.359
You talk like a piece of trash.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.798
You act like a spoiled brat.

10:13.665 --> 10:16.278
You are a repugnant human being

10:16.278 --> 10:19.401
and I need you to go back
to wherever you came from

10:19.401 --> 10:21.566
and give me back my wife.

10:22.068 --> 10:24.130
I demand you remove
this man.

10:24.130 --> 10:26.356
I demand that you wake up!

10:26.356 --> 10:27.261
You wake up!

10:27.261 --> 10:28.209
You're crazy!

10:28.209 --> 10:29.206
He's crazy.

10:29.206 --> 10:31.723
Isn't this the part
where the doctors...

10:31.723 --> 10:34.130
or Ashton Kutcher,
or someone comes in and...

10:34.130 --> 10:36.005
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

10:37.507 --> 10:39.111
Your name is
Allison Dubois.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.458
You are a wife.

10:42.352 --> 10:42.933
A mother.

10:43.503 --> 10:44.675
You have three children.

10:45.639 --> 10:48.378
Sometimes you see
dead people.

10:49.776 --> 10:50.874
Any of this
sound familiar?

10:51.771 --> 10:53.438
You are prone
to psychic episodes.

10:54.746 --> 10:56.532
I think this may
be one of them.

10:57.513 --> 10:59.068
And we have
to get it to end.

10:59.068 --> 11:00.223
Somehow...

11:01.574 --> 11:02.723
you have to make
it to end.

11:09.384 --> 11:11.174
If you could just call
my husband, Tom.

11:11.174 --> 11:12.162
I am your husband.

11:13.817 --> 11:14.621
I'm your husband.

11:15.559 --> 11:16.005
Me.

11:23.344 --> 11:25.496
Why don't you step outside
and give me a minute with her.

11:27.255 --> 11:27.963
Okay.

11:38.456 --> 11:41.482
That man is certifiable.

11:42.292 --> 11:45.112
That man is a husband
worried about his wife.

11:45.112 --> 11:46.764
He may be someone's husband.

11:46.764 --> 11:47.927
He's certainly not mine.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.127
Okay.

11:54.388 --> 11:56.023
You're Sandra O'Bannon.

11:57.446 --> 11:58.777
You're not married,
are you, Detective?

11:59.491 --> 12:01.184
No, Ma'am.
I didn't think so.

12:01.184 --> 12:03.051
'Cause you are not
yet exasperating.

12:03.051 --> 12:04.490
You still listen.

12:05.286 --> 12:06.503
I'm all ears now, Sandra.

12:08.024 --> 12:08.963
Tell me about yourself.

12:08.963 --> 12:11.686
My husband is
Dr. Thomas O'Bannon.

12:11.686 --> 12:14.345
We live at 2323
Glendale Lane.

12:14.345 --> 12:15.909
I can give you all
my contact numbers.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.155
In a minute.

12:19.588 --> 12:22.001
Tell me about the last thing
you remember.

12:22.001 --> 12:23.038
Tell me about last night.

12:23.753 --> 12:25.003
Everything that happened

12:25.003 --> 12:26.142
before you woke up
this morning.

12:26.936 --> 12:28.021
I don't know...
I went out.

12:28.021 --> 12:29.275
Out where?

12:30.738 --> 12:32.135
The Spotted Pony.

12:32.135 --> 12:33.539
The bar on Mesa?

12:34.264 --> 12:35.458
Were you drinking,
Sandra?

12:35.458 --> 12:36.788
No, I was turning tricks.

12:37.541 --> 12:38.549
Of course I was drinking.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.480
I was at a bar.

12:40.919 --> 12:41.498
Heavily?

12:44.801 --> 12:45.553
Look...

12:48.675 --> 12:51.591
Yesterday I found out that my
husband was having an affair.

12:53.421 --> 12:58.022
One minute we're planning
a getaway for Valentine's Day...

12:58.022 --> 13:01.067
the next I discover that he
is sleeping with someone else.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.409
Yes. Heavily.

13:02.409 --> 13:05.100
The answer to the question
is "heavily."

13:07.534 --> 13:09.797
Do you actually remember
going home with Mr. Dubois?

13:09.797 --> 13:13.015
I have done a lot of
incredibly stupid things

13:13.015 --> 13:13.883
in my marriage,

13:13.883 --> 13:15.783
issued a lot of really
wicked threats,

13:15.783 --> 13:18.315
but I have never cheated
on my husband.

13:18.315 --> 13:19.024
Never.

13:24.795 --> 13:26.398
Would you do something
for me, Sandra?

13:28.067 --> 13:32.318
If you stop saying my name

13:32.318 --> 13:34.437
like you're humoring
a small child.

13:37.162 --> 13:38.046
Go over there.

13:39.090 --> 13:41.180
Tell me what you see when
you look in the mirror.

13:42.248 --> 13:43.043
Humor me.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.415
What do you want to know?

13:58.285 --> 13:59.074
Describe yourself.

14:00.694 --> 14:02.668
Okay, I'm five eight.

14:04.096 --> 14:05.091
Stylish looking.

14:05.815 --> 14:07.322
Interesting looking.

14:07.996 --> 14:10.264
Pretty, sometimes.

14:10.264 --> 14:12.080
Maybe not today.

14:14.832 --> 14:17.980
I have my father's eyes...
brown.

14:17.980 --> 14:20.828
My mother's nose, thin.

14:21.630 --> 14:25.235
Boobs courtesy of my husband.

14:28.927 --> 14:31.106
My hair is a mess.

14:31.106 --> 14:32.614
But Geoffrey can fix that,

14:32.614 --> 14:34.794
if I can convince him
to fit me in this week.

14:35.492 --> 14:35.907
Uh, sorry,

14:35.907 --> 14:37.111
what color did you say
it was again?

14:37.628 --> 14:39.072
Why, you like it?

14:40.419 --> 14:42.995
My hairdresser calls it
Burnt Auburn.

14:43.855 --> 14:45.859
This is not from a bottle.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.799
?

14:53.658 --> 14:55.199
The house Allison
broke into this morning

14:55.199 --> 14:57.585
is owned by
a Dr. Thomas O'Bannon

14:57.585 --> 14:58.490
and his wife Sandra.

14:58.490 --> 14:59.750
He's a surgeon.

15:00.353 --> 15:01.441
She's wealthy in
her own right.

15:01.441 --> 15:02.595
Richer than God,
actually.

15:02.595 --> 15:03.871
Inherited a fortune
from her Daddy.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.255
Married six years.

15:05.255 --> 15:06.171
That's all she wrote.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.283
Have we been able
to reach them?

15:08.283 --> 15:10.381
Talked to the husband's
office this morning,

15:10.381 --> 15:11.882
they say he's on
vacation next week.

15:11.882 --> 15:13.329
Apparently they have
a house outside of Prescott.

15:14.529 --> 15:16.053
No phones, no cell reception.

15:17.631 --> 15:20.930
Well, once we do
get a hold of them,

15:21.637 --> 15:22.914
I'm sure I can
make these breaking

15:22.914 --> 15:24.161
and entering
charges go away.

15:24.161 --> 15:26.094
The problem is, until
we get a hold of them

15:26.094 --> 15:27.393
I can't just let
her walk free.

15:28.066 --> 15:30.053
Wait a second, you mean,
she's gotta stay in jail

15:30.053 --> 15:32.652
until...
Actually I had
another thought.

15:32.652 --> 15:35.602
What, no, no, no, that...
This can't be happening.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.434
Listen to me.

15:37.119 --> 15:38.530
I can't imagine that

15:38.530 --> 15:40.435
in her present state you're
anxious to have her at home.

15:40.435 --> 15:42.241
I don't think she'd go
willingly anyway...

15:42.241 --> 15:45.079
and it's probably
not smart or safe

15:45.079 --> 15:46.235
to have her around
the children.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.283
And frankly, legally,
we have no choice.

15:48.283 --> 15:49.535
She committed a crime.

15:52.142 --> 15:53.083
I'm gonna pull some strings

15:53.083 --> 15:55.022
and have her remanded
to a state mental facility.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.073
Are you serious?

15:56.073 --> 15:57.556
I know she'll be far
more comfortable

15:57.556 --> 15:59.175
and she'll be treated
far more humanely

15:59.175 --> 16:00.283
than if she were in jail.

16:00.283 --> 16:01.758
The second she's
feeling better...

16:01.758 --> 16:03.488
the second she knows
she's Allison Dubois.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.917
I'll go before a judge
and get her out of there.

16:05.917 --> 16:06.801
I don't know.

16:07.462 --> 16:09.166
It's not like we really
have any choice, Joe.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.491
All right then, Mr. Dubois.

16:14.491 --> 16:15.782
Why don't you say your good-byes

16:15.782 --> 16:17.563
and we'll get
Mrs. Dubois settled in.

16:17.563 --> 16:19.598
She prefers to be called
Mrs. O'Bannon.

16:19.598 --> 16:21.158
It is my name,
after all.

16:21.841 --> 16:22.859
I'll make a note of it.

16:25.122 --> 16:25.973
I'm really hoping

16:25.973 --> 16:27.655
this is only gonna last
for a day or two.

16:28.274 --> 16:29.402
Everyone assured me

16:29.402 --> 16:30.926
that the second you're back
to your old self...

16:30.926 --> 16:31.729
Listen to me.

16:32.348 --> 16:33.672
I don't know who you are

16:34.466 --> 16:35.999
or how you got all these people

16:35.999 --> 16:37.498
to believe your crazy story.

16:38.109 --> 16:39.625
You can't hold me
prisoner forever.

16:39.625 --> 16:40.916
My husband will find me.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.183
He will get me out.

16:42.183 --> 16:44.018
And when he does,
I will see to it

16:44.018 --> 16:47.183
that you pay for everything
that you've done.

16:48.414 --> 16:49.264
All of you.

17:10.718 --> 17:11.788
Hey, Dad.

17:11.788 --> 17:12.528
Where's Mom?

17:13.438 --> 17:14.079
What's going on?

17:16.115 --> 17:17.810
How come
you're picking us up?

17:18.365 --> 17:19.938
It's nice to see you, too.

17:20.733 --> 17:22.250
You're not walking today?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.490
I wanted to talk to mom
about something.

17:24.490 --> 17:25.571
Is she still at work?

17:25.571 --> 17:28.448
Well, actually mom had to go
on a little trip for work.

17:29.043 --> 17:30.446
But she didn't
even say good-bye!

17:30.446 --> 17:32.867
Yeah, I know and she feels
really badly about that.

17:33.614 --> 17:34.473
You all buckled up?

17:34.473 --> 17:36.029
Mm-hmm.
So, can I call her?

17:36.585 --> 17:37.883
Actually she's flying.

17:37.883 --> 17:39.560
She's in the air
right now and...

17:40.556 --> 17:42.828
and she's not gonna land
until late tonight.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.488
And then she's in
a different time zone

17:44.488 --> 17:45.958
so it's gonna be tricky.

17:46.898 --> 17:48.830
So it's just gonna be us
for a couple of days.

17:48.830 --> 17:50.689
And I'm gonna need
your help, okay?

17:51.267 --> 17:52.167
Sure, Dad.
Okay.

17:56.258 --> 17:57.255
I just wanted to make sure

17:57.255 --> 17:59.166
that she was settled in
for the night.

18:01.104 --> 18:02.947
Okay... good.

18:04.191 --> 18:07.058
Um, what time would you suggest
that I call in the morning?

18:09.061 --> 18:10.008
Okay.

18:10.217 --> 18:10.930
Thank you, nurse.

18:23.231 --> 18:23.953
Yeah, hello.

18:25.561 --> 18:27.078
So, Mom went on
a business trip?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.231
She didn't take her cell phone?

18:34.021 --> 18:35.048
She must have forgotten it.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.062
Forgot her phone.

18:38.947 --> 18:40.402
Didn't say goodbye.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.492
Dad, is Mom okay?

18:50.067 --> 18:51.205
Your mom is fine, Ariel.

18:52.788 --> 18:53.440
She really is.

18:54.987 --> 18:56.273
And I promise you...

18:56.273 --> 18:58.095
she's gonna be back soon.

19:02.812 --> 19:03.911
So, now go to bed.

19:26.270 --> 19:27.210
Stop it, Tom!

19:27.771 --> 19:28.952
Stop what?

19:28.952 --> 19:30.579
Not talking to me.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.243
Fine. I'll speak.

19:33.279 --> 19:34.034
Gee, Sandra,

19:34.034 --> 19:35.716
I sure loved getting up
in the middle of the night,

19:35.716 --> 19:37.227
and driving down
to the Spotted Pony,

19:37.227 --> 19:39.333
and scraping my drunken
wife off a bar room floor.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.968
All right!
I've changed my mind;

19:40.968 --> 19:42.182
you can shut up again.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.937
Yeah, I just love that.

19:43.937 --> 19:46.157
Well, I bet it wasn't half
as much fun as finding out

19:46.157 --> 19:47.903
your husband was cheating
on you.

19:47.903 --> 19:50.587
Two days before
Valentine's Day, no less.

19:53.564 --> 19:54.513
Where the hell are we?

19:54.513 --> 19:55.535
This is the road
to the cabin.

19:55.535 --> 19:57.728
And if you think I'm
driving to get you,

19:58.547 --> 19:59.670
driving you all
the way back home,

19:59.670 --> 20:00.888
and then turning around
and coming back

20:00.888 --> 20:02.302
to the cabin in the
morning, you're crazy.

20:07.846 --> 20:11.464
Light that up in here
and I will break your hand.

20:20.379 --> 20:21.221
One puff.

20:22.328 --> 20:23.619
And I promise
I'll put it out.

20:35.510 --> 20:37.257
I can count to one, Tom.

20:41.338 --> 20:42.806
Oh, you unbelievable ass!

20:42.806 --> 20:44.772
It's burning the upholstery!

20:47.327 --> 20:48.017
Holy!

21:01.498 --> 21:03.874
ff the phone
with the Prescott Police.

21:03.874 --> 21:04.967
Asked them to send a uniform up

21:04.967 --> 21:06.550
to the O'Bannon's place
in the mountains.

21:06.550 --> 21:07.832
No one was there.

21:07.832 --> 21:09.082
In fact, they never showed.

21:09.733 --> 21:10.552
Never showed?

21:12.557 --> 21:13.584
Not to be morbid

21:14.227 --> 21:16.095
but we've got to be thinking
the same thing here.

21:16.095 --> 21:18.181
That maybe those two had
a little accident

21:18.181 --> 21:19.929
on the way to their cabin,
and now they're both, uh...

21:20.595 --> 21:21.742
no longer with us?

21:22.465 --> 21:23.748
Maybe one of them is with us.

21:23.748 --> 21:25.087
Spending a little time
with my wife.

21:26.571 --> 21:27.310
Look at the bright side--

21:27.310 --> 21:28.904
at least you didn't wake up
as Mr. O'Bannon.

21:29.962 --> 21:31.565
At any rate, I'm going to, uh...

21:31.565 --> 21:33.852
start checking with hospitals
along the route.

21:34.515 --> 21:36.362
Hey, uh, can you hold on
one second?

21:36.362 --> 21:37.437
I got another call coming in.

21:38.980 --> 21:40.261
Dubois residence.

21:40.826 --> 21:41.509
Mr. Dubois?

21:42.103 --> 21:44.122
The doctor has examined
your wife Allison.

21:44.122 --> 21:47.088
And he asked me to call and
report to you that she is awake,

21:47.088 --> 21:49.139
and lucid, and has been asking
to see you.

21:49.919 --> 21:51.929
Wait a second, uh, to see me?

21:51.929 --> 21:55.086
Or her, uh... her other husband?

21:55.843 --> 21:57.023
You are Joe Dubois?

21:57.570 --> 21:58.266
Yes.

21:58.266 --> 22:00.300
Well, then you're the one
she's asking for.

22:06.358 --> 22:06.826
Hey.

22:07.421 --> 22:08.072
Husband.

22:11.479 --> 22:12.147
Al?

22:14.205 --> 22:14.883
Joe.

22:16.328 --> 22:17.427
Allison.

22:18.430 --> 22:20.183
Allison, Allison, Allison

22:24.300 --> 22:25.230
It's so good
to have you back.

22:25.230 --> 22:27.412
Joe. Joe.

22:28.634 --> 22:29.192
Joe.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.054
It's so good to be back.

22:32.569 --> 22:33.420
Mr. Dubois?

22:37.257 --> 22:38.982
I'm almost done here.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.486
Um, could I borrow
your cell phone?

22:43.486 --> 22:44.459
Check my voicemail?

22:51.192 --> 22:54.212
Yes, I need the number
for Prescott General Hospital,

22:54.212 --> 22:55.246
Patient Information.

23:06.461 --> 23:08.560
Yes. I need
information

23:08.560 --> 23:11.045
on a patient named
Thomas O'Bannon.

23:11.823 --> 23:13.818
Would have been admitted
night before last.

23:14.973 --> 23:15.673
Yes.

23:22.047 --> 23:22.706
You.

23:24.253 --> 23:25.256
Well, don't just
stand there!

23:25.256 --> 23:26.443
Open the door!
Yes, ma'am.

23:28.079 --> 23:30.693
I need you to take me to
Prescott General Hospital, now.

23:30.693 --> 23:31.492
Yes, ma'am.

23:34.412 --> 23:37.015
Okay. Okay.

23:57.349 --> 23:58.202
Thomas O'Bannon?

23:58.202 --> 23:59.437
Room 116.

24:04.536 --> 24:05.254
Tom!

24:06.113 --> 24:06.900
Thank goodness.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.970
I was worried
you were really hurt.

24:10.537 --> 24:11.021
I'm sorry.

24:11.021 --> 24:11.892
Are you talking to me?

24:11.892 --> 24:13.222
Tom, it's me.

24:13.222 --> 24:14.753
Tom? Who's
your friend?

24:14.753 --> 24:16.979
Or have we met already?

24:16.979 --> 24:17.807
I'm sorry,

24:18.547 --> 24:20.877
I've been a little hazy
since the accident, but...

24:21.624 --> 24:24.243
the doctors and
Tom assure me

24:24.243 --> 24:25.750
that it will all
come back to me.

24:26.483 --> 24:27.580
And you are?

24:28.152 --> 24:29.011
I'm Sandra.

24:29.011 --> 24:30.190
I'm Tom's wife.

24:31.623 --> 24:32.516
And you are?

24:32.516 --> 24:34.056
She's no one
we know, dear.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.877
But thank you for
your concern, miss.

24:42.519 --> 24:43.343
Tell you what I know.

24:43.343 --> 24:46.082
Someone matching Allison's
description took a town car

24:46.082 --> 24:47.983
from the state mental health
facility where you were,

24:48.853 --> 24:50.709
and asked to be driven
to Prescott General Hospital.

24:51.329 --> 24:53.317
I'm about to drive out there
and find out what I can.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.774
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.

24:55.490 --> 24:56.444
Thank you, Detective.

25:04.290 --> 25:05.693
Girls, pizza's here!

25:06.223 --> 25:07.611
Everyone wash their hands!

25:11.816 --> 25:13.162
Hey, husband.

25:20.297 --> 25:20.918
Please.

25:23.971 --> 25:25.004
I need you.

25:27.411 --> 25:28.925
I need your help.

25:31.115 --> 25:33.039
I don't have anyone else to ask.

25:34.630 --> 25:35.744
I don't know where to go.

25:38.032 --> 25:39.595
Go talk to your husband.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.746
Happy Valentine's Day.

26:04.746 --> 26:06.807
Oh, yeah. Right.

26:07.424 --> 26:09.403
Happy Valentine's Day.

26:10.175 --> 26:11.426
Hey, Mommy's home!

26:11.426 --> 26:12.931
Mommy's home!
Uh-oh.

26:13.661 --> 26:14.608
Uh-oh.

26:15.317 --> 26:15.901
Mom!

26:25.340 --> 26:26.215
Mom!

26:27.593 --> 26:28.212
Dad!

26:28.936 --> 26:29.642
I'm sorry.

26:29.642 --> 26:31.262
There's no way I
can pull this off.

26:31.947 --> 26:34.896
They're gonna know instantly
that I'm not your wife,

26:34.896 --> 26:36.202
that I'm not
their mother.

26:36.202 --> 26:37.836
Okay, you want
to figure this thing out?

26:37.836 --> 26:39.512
You want to get to the bottom
of this thing?

26:40.077 --> 26:41.359
We can't do it from here.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.746
I promise you, this will work.

26:43.746 --> 26:45.293
It's Valentine's Day.

26:45.293 --> 26:48.440
Every year, Allison and I go out
to dinner on Valentine's Day.

26:49.862 --> 26:51.722
We just got to go out there,
say good night,

26:51.722 --> 26:53.518
and then we're out the door
and in the car.

26:53.518 --> 26:55.480
I don't know. I don't
know if I can do it.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.035
I don't know about
these clothes.

27:00.477 --> 27:01.584
?

27:02.156 --> 27:03.451
Do you buy it?

27:04.141 --> 27:05.540
Hmm?

27:05.540 --> 27:07.117
I guess it's kind of
Valentine-y.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.154
Um...

27:13.444 --> 27:14.681
Really?
Yeah.

27:14.681 --> 27:17.634
You know that's gonna make
this dress a lot less exciting.

27:18.229 --> 27:19.608
That's okay.
We have three kids.

27:19.608 --> 27:21.259
That's plenty
of excitement.

27:23.156 --> 27:23.727
All right.

27:25.992 --> 27:26.931
All right.

27:27.777 --> 27:28.548
I can do this.

27:30.026 --> 27:32.717
Just remember,
it's Arianna, Belinda, Sheree.

27:33.529 --> 27:34.716
Ariel, Bridgette
and Marie.

27:36.908 --> 27:38.350
Maybe I'll just
call them "girls."

27:41.948 --> 27:44.105
Okay, kids, Mommy and I
are going out

27:44.105 --> 27:46.083
for a special
Valentine's Day dinner.

27:46.083 --> 27:47.444
Ariel, you're the boss.

27:47.444 --> 27:48.459
You're kidding!

27:48.459 --> 27:49.793
But Mommy just got home!

27:49.793 --> 27:52.404
And I haven't even
shown her the cards I got.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.126
And she hasn't
given us hers.

27:54.804 --> 27:55.615
I know.

27:55.615 --> 27:56.706
It sucks, right, girls?

27:56.706 --> 27:57.981
So how was
your trip, Mom?

27:58.711 --> 27:59.906
Where'd you go?
What'd you do?

28:00.509 --> 28:01.315
You know what?

28:01.315 --> 28:02.822
I would love to know
the answer to that, too.

28:02.822 --> 28:03.905
But if we don't go
right now,

28:03.905 --> 28:05.124
we're gonna lose
our reservation, so...

28:05.124 --> 28:06.958
Didn't you need
your cell phone?

28:07.738 --> 28:09.005
You left it here.

28:09.005 --> 28:09.940
Your pse, too.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.812
That's another
excellent question.

28:11.812 --> 28:13.305
Boy, we got a lot
to talk about at dinner.

28:13.305 --> 28:15.377
Bye, guys.
What about kisses?

28:16.778 --> 28:17.929
Later, promise.

28:18.924 --> 28:20.121
Bye... bye, girls.

28:26.012 --> 28:27.286
Something's just not right.

28:30.726 --> 28:33.049
I need to check on
some things at my house.

28:34.487 --> 28:35.659
Mmm. What do
you mean?

28:35.659 --> 28:36.389
What things?

28:37.184 --> 28:39.418
We're not gonna get
in any trouble are we?

28:39.418 --> 28:40.803
It's the maid's
night off.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.566
My husband's still
in the hospital.

28:42.566 --> 28:43.497
I think we'll be fine.

28:44.308 --> 28:46.282
I just, I need to try
to find out...

28:47.840 --> 28:50.352
more about her.

28:53.567 --> 28:54.938
She must be very rich.

28:57.392 --> 28:59.163
Turns out, Tom likes rich.

29:01.415 --> 29:02.258
Which is funny,

29:02.258 --> 29:03.997
because he didn't
in the beginning.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.912
Which is why I think
I found him so damn attractive.

29:08.786 --> 29:10.196
He wouldn't
let me buy dinner.

29:10.196 --> 29:12.304
He wouldn't let me
pay for a drink.

29:15.198 --> 29:16.794
But I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

29:17.653 --> 29:18.632
Everyone likes rich.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.116
At least, once they've had a...

29:22.086 --> 29:23.125
free sample.

29:25.645 --> 29:27.457
Was she there today
at the hospital?

29:28.692 --> 29:29.912
That's the weird thing.

29:31.652 --> 29:33.100
I was there.

29:34.995 --> 29:36.344
And you should have
seen us together.

29:38.398 --> 29:39.739
He was so tender,

29:39.739 --> 29:42.366
in a way that
he hasn't been in years.

29:44.807 --> 29:45.562
It was as if...

29:45.562 --> 29:47.729
I don't even know
how to describe it.

29:48.508 --> 29:53.435
It was as if all of
the bad parts of our marriage

29:53.435 --> 29:56.302
were just knocked right out
of us in that car crash

29:56.302 --> 30:00.159
and some lighter, happier
version of Tom and me

30:00.159 --> 30:02.235
just walked right out
of the wreckage.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.352
The only problem is...

30:10.415 --> 30:13.139
I'm part of the baggage
that got left behind.

30:23.093 --> 30:23.688
Just...

30:25.513 --> 30:27.510
take Scottsdale Road,

30:27.510 --> 30:29.417
and I'll guide you
from there.

30:54.178 --> 30:55.043
It's nothing.

30:55.043 --> 30:56.197
It's Mommy's cell.

30:57.177 --> 30:59.018
I can't believe she's still
running around without it.

31:00.009 --> 31:01.036
Hey, this is Allison.

31:01.036 --> 31:02.399
Leave a message at the tone.

31:04.002 --> 31:06.434
Hey. H.

31:07.341 --> 31:08.284
Uh...

31:09.389 --> 31:11.000
I don't know where you are,

31:12.645 --> 31:13.942
but it's Valentine's Day.

31:15.371 --> 31:16.671
So Happy Valentine's day.

31:19.412 --> 31:21.642
You know, I got to tell you,

31:23.777 --> 31:25.947
hearing that message,
the one before the beep,

31:25.947 --> 31:27.518
that was the highlight
of my day.

31:30.557 --> 31:32.143
At least I know that that's you.

31:34.589 --> 31:36.762
Good God almighty, Allison.

31:38.828 --> 31:39.574
Where are you?

31:42.174 --> 31:43.435
I miss you.

31:58.789 --> 32:01.054
Mrs. O'Bannon?
I'm up here!

32:09.870 --> 32:11.331
It's been going on for years.

32:12.127 --> 32:15.517
There are letters
in that box from 2004.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.880
Receipts forifts he
bought her with my money.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.387
Cars. Jewels.

32:21.174 --> 32:22.361
How could I not have known?

32:23.696 --> 32:24.698
I'm truly sorry.

32:25.464 --> 32:28.236
But we probably ought
to get going. It's late.

32:28.236 --> 32:29.926
My kids have school tomorrow.

32:32.172 --> 32:33.533
I don't want to go anywhere.

32:36.922 --> 32:39.723
I want to sleep in my own bed.

32:41.480 --> 32:44.386
I have a horrible feeling

32:44.386 --> 32:46.303
it's gonna be the last time.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.988
Here's the thing.
I can't go home without you.

32:49.988 --> 32:52.319
My kids will definitely
know something's up.

32:52.994 --> 32:56.244
I want to help you figure
this thing out, I do,

32:56.244 --> 32:58.169
but we have to go back
to my place.

32:59.729 --> 33:01.445
Oh, my, is that the line

33:01.445 --> 33:03.450
you used on me
at the Spotted Pony?

33:04.279 --> 33:05.328
Now, isn't Abigail

33:05.328 --> 33:08.066
old enough to watch
the others overnight?

33:08.066 --> 33:09.701
Ariel. Uh, no.

33:09.701 --> 33:12.262
That doesn't work.
It's a school night.

33:12.262 --> 33:13.826
Allison and I...

33:13.826 --> 33:14.661
So, wait.

33:16.525 --> 33:18.935
The two of you have
never gone out and said,

33:19.674 --> 33:21.093
"Oh, screw it.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.980
Let's stay out
all night and party?"

33:26.185 --> 33:28.076
Ah...that's hard to explain.

33:28.076 --> 33:28.935
But for me, uh...

33:30.670 --> 33:32.760
being with Allison is the party.

33:35.618 --> 33:36.914
And for, Allison...

33:38.920 --> 33:40.915
there's kind of no better
place to have a party

33:40.915 --> 33:42.655
than at home with the kids.

33:44.995 --> 33:45.551
God...

33:48.719 --> 33:51.786
I would die to feel
that way about someone...

33:52.766 --> 33:54.030
some place.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.343
I would die...

33:58.139 --> 34:01.436
to have someone feel
that way about me.

34:05.649 --> 34:06.764
We really ought to get going.

34:18.668 --> 34:21.118
So how are we going to do this?

34:21.853 --> 34:22.723
What's that?

34:22.723 --> 34:24.281
The bed thing.

34:24.944 --> 34:28.627
I realize that we've
already slept together.
Don't worry.

34:28.627 --> 34:31.081
These things have a way
of working themselves out.

34:31.081 --> 34:33.606
No, no, no, no. That's not
the answer I'm looking for.

34:37.279 --> 34:37.891
Oh...

34:43.827 --> 34:45.344
You take the
Bridgette side.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.331
I'll take the Marie side.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.482
I'm sure you'll feel very safe.

34:56.598 --> 34:57.346
Holy!

35:15.080 --> 35:17.403
Son of a bitch that hurt.

35:31.247 --> 35:32.361
Now would be a good time

35:32.361 --> 35:33.875
to come out of the woods
and give me a hand.

35:36.471 --> 35:38.707
Please don't raise
your voice to me.

35:39.438 --> 35:42.011
I've been sitting in this
scary forest in the dark

35:42.011 --> 35:44.040
since you dropped
me off three hours ago.

35:44.564 --> 35:45.835
I'm not in the mood.
Hey.

35:46.428 --> 35:49.096
I just slammed myself into
a tree at 35 miles an hour

35:49.096 --> 35:51.792
on purpose so you could have
weekend houses and foreign cars.

35:51.792 --> 35:53.107
Let's not compare moods.

35:53.749 --> 35:54.778
Give me a hand with her.

36:02.962 --> 36:05.199
Grab her legs. There you go.

36:12.533 --> 36:13.535
Come on. Just drag her.

36:22.115 --> 36:22.964
Okay...

36:24.342 --> 36:25.266
we both know what to do.

36:25.892 --> 36:26.885
I'll uncover the grave...

36:27.480 --> 36:28.718
and we'll both lower her in.

36:30.599 --> 36:31.593
What are you doing?

36:31.593 --> 36:33.742
Why are you turning away
from me? I've seen your body.

36:33.742 --> 36:35.244
Hell, I made it.

36:35.886 --> 36:37.170
Not to mention your face.

36:38.085 --> 36:40.359
It's not you, it's her.

36:41.003 --> 36:43.074
I think she's still alive.
Huh?

36:45.240 --> 36:47.192
Nothing's ever easy
with you dear, is it?

36:57.454 --> 37:00.465
Not that this isn't a lovely
stretch of road or anything,

37:00.465 --> 37:02.956
but I'm still a little fuzzy
as to what we're doing here.

37:02.956 --> 37:05.287
That's the spot.
Right there.

37:17.257 --> 37:18.254
Don't forget the shovel.

37:30.817 --> 37:32.453
Okay. So we're here?

37:32.453 --> 37:34.348
No. No, we're not.

37:58.607 --> 38:00.179
What is it? What
are you looking for?

38:05.597 --> 38:07.184
Thank you.

38:09.405 --> 38:10.285
What did you just say?

38:10.939 --> 38:12.103
I said, "thank you."

38:13.051 --> 38:14.741
Sorry. It just slipped out.

38:15.935 --> 38:17.025
Give me a minute.

38:17.025 --> 38:18.439
I'll talk trash...

38:18.439 --> 38:20.994
behave like a spoiled brat.

38:21.764 --> 38:24.655
Go back to being the
repugnant human being

38:24.655 --> 38:26.033
that you've come
to know and love.

38:26.033 --> 38:28.262
That's okay.
"Thank you" works, too.

38:33.384 --> 38:33.988
What?

38:44.979 --> 38:46.179
Oh.
Oh.

38:50.898 --> 38:53.354
That's you, isn't it?
No...

38:53.354 --> 38:57.133
no, no, not now.
No, not yet.

38:57.779 --> 38:59.833
I don't want it to be over.

39:00.679 --> 39:03.138
I've still have so much
to do, so much to learn.

39:05.795 --> 39:07.605
Hey, Allison?

39:08.505 --> 39:10.969
Allison? Sandra? Allison?

39:12.896 --> 39:13.778
Are you okay?

39:14.110 --> 39:15.451
Are you okay?

39:16.302 --> 39:17.452
Are you okay?

39:26.742 --> 39:28.378
I feel kind of whoozy.

39:29.605 --> 39:31.415
You were unconscious
for a while there.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.838
You scared the
crap out of me.

39:36.473 --> 39:37.843
How did I get here, Joe?

39:39.948 --> 39:40.936
You don't remember?

39:42.611 --> 39:44.455
Last thing I remember I was...

39:44.455 --> 39:47.122
getting a box of
Valentine cards for Bridge.

39:49.292 --> 39:51.430
Do you think we're
gonna be here for long?

39:51.430 --> 39:53.368
I still have to get
something for you.

40:19.904 --> 40:21.186
In a bizarre story,

40:21.186 --> 40:23.629
prominent plastic surgeon
Dr. Tom O'Bannon

40:23.629 --> 40:25.970
was charged with the murder
of his wife today

40:25.970 --> 40:28.594
after he confessed
to staging a car accident.

40:28.594 --> 40:30.568
It was all part
of a plot to murder

40:30.568 --> 40:32.408
Mrs. Sandra Pinzler O'Bannon,

40:32.408 --> 40:34.631
heir to the Pinzler
oil fortune.

40:34.631 --> 40:37.504
The couple, seen here
in their wedding photo,

40:37.504 --> 40:39.396
were apparently
on the verge of divorce

40:39.396 --> 40:40.529
when the murder took place.

40:40.529 --> 40:42.792
Prosecutors believe
that in order to maintain

40:42.792 --> 40:46.193
access to his wife's
inheritance, Dr. O'Bannon

40:46.193 --> 40:47.589
concocted a bizarre plan

40:47.589 --> 40:49.480
to have another woman
impersonate her.

40:50.049 --> 40:51.283
According to the indictment,

40:51.283 --> 40:54.734
over the last year and a half
Dr. O'Bannon performed multiple

40:54.734 --> 40:56.762
plastic surgeries
on his co-conspirator

40:56.762 --> 40:58.830
and lover, Lisa Wolfe,

40:58.830 --> 41:01.146
until she was virtually
indistinguishable

41:01.146 --> 41:02.134
from his wife.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.188
Ms. Wolfe, seen here on the
right in a picture taken

41:05.188 --> 41:06.830
shortly after her arrest today,

41:06.830 --> 41:08.418
is being held without bail.

41:09.038 --> 41:11.118
Had the ruse been successful,
Mrs. O'Bannon's fortune...

41:11.118 --> 41:13.474
Still getting caught up
on current events, I see.

41:15.185 --> 41:18.428
Well, I did lose three whole
days of my life, you know?

41:18.428 --> 41:20.349
Hmm, believe me, I know.

41:21.971 --> 41:23.230
Speaking of which...

41:25.709 --> 41:28.032
um, about
Valentine's Day...

41:28.032 --> 41:29.474
Oh yeah. Thank you.

41:32.519 --> 41:33.316
For what?

41:33.316 --> 41:35.676
When all this started,
I really hadn't

41:35.676 --> 41:37.295
had a chance to get
you anything.

41:37.889 --> 41:39.076
I mean, I was going to.

41:39.076 --> 41:40.823
What are you talking about?

41:40.823 --> 41:42.457
I got your valentine.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.883
I just checked my voicemail.

41:49.122 --> 41:51.203
Now, don't you want to know
what I have for you?

41:52.930 --> 41:53.803
Sure.

41:54.982 --> 41:56.121
Don't just sit there.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.127
Check your voicemail.

42:17.789 --> 42:19.312
That woman is a mind reader

42:20.340 --> 42:27.295
