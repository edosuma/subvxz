I'm 13, living on a cattle ranch
in Shawnee, Colorado.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.687
-For me, at ten years old.
-I was about 18 or something.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.732
I must have been...
I don't know, about nine.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.316
At the age of 15,

00:27.652 --> 00:33.867
<i>I hear this film is supposed to change</i>
<i>the way people make movies.</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:37.537
I was watching <i>Saturday Night Live,</i> and
this commercial comes up and... (GASPS)

(EXPLODING)

00:51.176 --> 00:52.469
I didn't go into it cold.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.971
We knew that it was some
big kind of space opera.

(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

00:59.559 --> 01:03.438
I saw <i>Star Wars</i> the weekend it opened
at Grauman's Chinese Theater.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.899
I went to see it in Leicester Square
with a few friends.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.067
I was in Hong Kong.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.612
In a multiplex at the Briarwood Mall
in Ann Arbor.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.656
Bunch of my friends waited in line
for, you know, like 12 hours.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.242
And that film had a profound effect on me.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.411
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.330
-Huh?
-It was absolutely fantastic.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.831
It was just magical.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.333
It was just stunning.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.169
It was like discovering
another floor of your house.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.130
It was like, "What? I can go there?"

01:29.214 --> 01:30.548
This is Red Five. I'm goin' in.

01:35.053 --> 01:38.848
My reaction was, "Wow,
they could make movies like that?"

01:38.973 --> 01:40.391
I mean, it really opened my eyes.

01:40.475 --> 01:45.188
It took everything to another level
on such a massive scale.

01:51.402 --> 01:55.365
We walked out and all I did was say
to Cheryl, "Want to see it again?"

01:55.448 --> 01:56.908
and she said, "Yes."

01:57.242 --> 02:01.955
And we walked over into the next
two hour line and watched it again.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.669
What? Like, there was nothing I couldn't
even... There are no words even still

02:07.752 --> 02:10.338
to describe what that felt like.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.966
I went home and I said,
"I'm quitting my job.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.761
"You have to pay the bills for a while.
I wanna make a film."

03:05.143 --> 03:10.773
When <i>Star Wars</i> ended, I went back
to doing commercials for a little bit.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.485
And figuring, well, that's it,
you know how movies are.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.737
That's the end of that.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.531
We did our job.
We worked really hard, had a great time,

03:18.656 --> 03:21.242
and then went on our separate ways.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.994
They split up because they wouldn't...

03:23.077 --> 03:25.705
They were down in LA
for six to nine months,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.791
and I wasn't doing anything.
ILM didn't exist.

Doug Trumbull was just setting up,

03:35.840 --> 03:38.218
<i>We ended up shooting the mothership.</i>

03:40.803 --> 03:46.309
Jon Erland and I, we got a call
from the producer on <i>Flesh Gordon.</i>

03:55.985 --> 03:58.613
And John Dykstra
immediately called us into the office.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.532
He said, "What in the world
are you guys doing?"

04:01.616 --> 04:03.743
<i>And he said, "There's a project</i>
<i>that's coming along.</i>

04:03.826 --> 04:06.496
<i>"I promise you, if you can wait</i>
<i>another three weeks or something,</i>

04:06.579 --> 04:08.248
"there is a big project that's coming."

04:08.331 --> 04:12.502
I didn't want <i>Star Wars</i> to finish.
I didn't drag my feet, but I didn't...

04:12.627 --> 04:15.922
I-I... The experience

04:16.005 --> 04:21.511
was so enjoyable and so enlightening.

04:21.761 --> 04:26.349
Everything about it was it was brilliant

<i>More than anything,</i>
<i>I wanted to keep those people.</i>

04:40.154 --> 04:41.614
<i>Those people were my friends.</i>

04:41.698 --> 04:44.701

<i>It was so exciting every day.</i>
<i>Coming to work was fun.</i>

04:48.496 --> 04:52.250
I went, "This is what I want to do."
(LAUGHING)

04:53.710 --> 04:57.505
<i>But at the time, even though</i> Star Wars
<i>was a great success,</i>

04:57.797 --> 04:59.799
<i>there was no way of knowing for certain</i>

05:00.133 --> 05:04.637
whether ILM would continue
or dissolve or whatever.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.728
<i>So I pursued doing</i> Battlestar Galactica.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.565
PETERSON: <i>He created</i>
<i>a company called Apogee.</i>

05:16.065 --> 05:19.569
And Apogee got the contract
for doing <i>Galactica.</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:24.907
I came back and I was probably there
on <i>Galactica</i> for maybe like eight months.

05:25.158 --> 05:31.831
So that crew that had finished the work
on the first <i>Star Wars</i> was still together

05:32.206 --> 05:37.128
<i>doing additional work in that environment,</i>
<i>with that equipment.</i>

05:37.211 --> 05:39.964
<i>We got the tools, we got the people.</i>

05:40.048 --> 05:42.550
I think we were still
in the unknown for <i>Galactica</i>

05:42.675 --> 05:46.054
wondering, "Why is George doing this?
Why is he letting us do this?"

05:46.220 --> 05:51.768
I lent it to John Dykstra
to do <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>

05:51.851 --> 05:53.436
<i>while I was off writing.</i>

05:53.519 --> 05:55.146
JOHN: <i>So we produced the stuff</i>

05:55.229 --> 05:58.524
<i>for</i> Battlestar Galactica,
<i>and I think that's when George decided</i>

05:58.608 --> 06:01.694
<i>he wanted to take the equipment</i>
<i>and move it to Marin.</i>

06:03.571 --> 06:06.032
I just said, "Look, I don't want
to live down there."

06:06.115 --> 06:08.284
We said, "Well, let's just move
to San Francisco.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.161
"We don't have to make movies in LA."

06:11.329 --> 06:15.750
PETERSON: <i>I was working in the model shop</i>
<i>on</i> Galactica <i>and Richard Edlund</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:20.129
<i>came downstairs and he said,</i>
<i>"There's a phone call for you upstairs,"</i>

06:20.213 --> 06:21.506
<i>not saying it very loud.</i>

06:21.964 --> 06:24.008
I said, "Well, who wants to talk to me?"

06:24.092 --> 06:27.428
There's a phone right here,
you know. He said, "No, no.

06:27.762 --> 06:33.476
"Go upstairs and take a phone
that's off the hook at Joe's desk.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.103
"Go right now."

06:36.979 --> 06:40.066
<i>And it was George and Gary,</i>

06:40.149 --> 06:44.320
<i>and then they said, "We want to do</i>
<i>the sequel in Northern California,</i>

06:44.737 --> 06:48.074
"but don't exclaim,
don't spread the word that

06:48.199 --> 06:50.118
"we're talking to a very few people."

06:51.536 --> 06:55.081
EDLUND:<i> There was all this talk about</i>
<i>a sequel and George is working on it.</i>

06:55.164 --> 07:00.002
And so, basically, I said, "Look,
if I get a call from up north,

07:00.086 --> 07:03.339
"you know I'm going to take that
phone call, and I'd be stupid not to."

07:03.423 --> 07:05.716
And we were all sort of
saying the same thing.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.345
We did hear that maybe George
might be doing another <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

07:09.595 --> 07:15.268
Dennis was the slam dunk to be hired,
and I knew I would be hired and Ken.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.522
I went to them and said, "Would you
like to come up to San Francisco?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.357
"We'll pay for getting you up there.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.609
"We'll find you a house,"
that whole thing.

07:24.026 --> 07:27.321
<i>It was performance-based.</i>
<i>It was who had done the best jobs.</i>

07:27.738 --> 07:29.699
<i>Some people didn't want to go up there.</i>

07:29.949 --> 07:32.535
<i>Some people who we had to try</i>
<i>to convince to come up,</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:35.079
but we knew we wanted Richard and Dennis.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.124
MUREN: <i>Filmmaking was</i>
<i>really important to me,</i>

07:38.207 --> 07:40.251
<i>and I certainly saw that</i>
<i>in George and I saw it</i>

07:40.334 --> 07:43.171
in the people that also
got invited up north.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.008
<i>It's like they went through and picked</i>
<i>the people that they thought,</i>

07:47.091 --> 07:50.178
<i>"Well, here's someone who is</i>
<i>a kindred soul."</i>

07:50.386 --> 07:52.096
EDLUND: <i>Who am I to argue?</i>

07:52.180 --> 07:55.850
<i>I mean, here we had this incredibly</i>
<i>well-received movie</i>

07:55.933 --> 08:00.396
<i>that I knew that our reputations</i>
<i>were on the line to best it with</i> Empire.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.860
And so basically when the phone call
came in, I left.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.489
For me, I mean, it was no question.

08:09.572 --> 08:14.702
<i>I could stay and work in this sort of</i>
<i>rundown warehouse</i>

08:15.161 --> 08:17.538
<i>in Van Nuys or I could</i>
<i>move to Marin County</i>

08:17.622 --> 08:20.291
and start a whole new
visual effects facility.

08:20.791 --> 08:26.172
I think most of those guys
were very much of that kind of person

08:26.255 --> 08:29.425
that would rather be in a place
like Marin than Van Nuys.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.804
MUREN: <i>The day of awakening,</i>
<i>that actually was the last straw,</i>

08:34.514 --> 08:37.934
<i>I was sitting outside in Van Nuys,</i>
<i>where we were doing</i> Galactica.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.772
<i>The Van Nuys airport is a half block away.</i>

08:43.189 --> 08:47.026
It's 105 degrees, we're facing
due west into the sun,

08:47.318 --> 08:49.654
<i>and the sky was orange and yellow.</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:52.031
And it dawned on me, this is hell.

08:54.242 --> 08:58.287
<i>And I have a chance to get out of hell</i>
<i>and go to someplace else,</i>

08:58.371 --> 08:59.789
and I just... And that was it.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.669
I don't know. I mean, it was...

09:05.545 --> 09:06.587
It's weird, right?

09:06.712 --> 09:10.967
Because the business of moving up north,
I wasn't invited to go.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.808
EDLUND: <i>I think he fully understood that</i>
<i>that was going to be the case.</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:22.812
I think he realized that there was
a bridge on fire there.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.147
He did a great job.

09:26.732 --> 09:30.152
But he was in a very difficult position
when he was making the movie.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.946
He was under a lot of pressure.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.156
He was, I think, over his head.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.326
So when changes would happen,
he would get very angry.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.245
I was not...

09:39.870 --> 09:44.000
Oh, shoot. I don't know, what was I not?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.502
Um...

09:46.586 --> 09:50.256
It wasn't... I can't even say
that he wanted a company man.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.633
I just...

09:53.342 --> 09:57.346
I probably was just too young
and volatile.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.307
(LAUGHING)

09:59.390 --> 10:03.060
John Dykstra called me into the office
and he was really angry.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.939
He actually took his desk,
and he lifted it up

10:07.106 --> 10:09.400
about four inches and he slammed it down,

10:09.483 --> 10:13.571
you know, and all the stuff on the table,
it was like... (IMITATES RUMBLING)

10:18.075 --> 10:21.203
<i>and then you get left at the station.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:23.831
How does that make sense?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.124
I don't know.

10:25.291 --> 10:31.505
The only thing I do know is that
that must have hurt really badly.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.176
You know, it wasn't... Uh...

10:35.259 --> 10:39.138
Am I disappointed that I wasn't invited?
Of course.

10:39.513 --> 10:43.434
But we got to break a lot of ground.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.854
And you know, there was,
there were some chip...

10:46.937 --> 10:49.231
There was some chipped paint
and there was some dents

10:49.315 --> 10:51.067
and a few scratches here and there.

10:51.233 --> 10:55.071
But it was so much fun.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.408
JOHNSTON: <i>It really was a lot of fun,</i>
<i>and I think that it was so tragic</i>

10:59.492 --> 11:01.911
<i>when we all split up.</i>

11:03.079 --> 11:05.039
It was like breaking up a family.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.762
MUREN: <i>It was just going to be</i>
<i>for a two-year job.</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:21.305
<i>That's all they would guarantee.</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:24.934
So I said, okay, and then managed
to convince my other friends

11:25.017 --> 11:27.978
who wanted to come up
and so we all kind of moved up as a group.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.647
That's kind of where it started,

11:29.730 --> 11:31.857
and that's when we were
at the Kerner facility.

11:37.196 --> 11:41.492
When we first moved into the building,
it was a single story structure,

11:41.575 --> 11:43.035
with no walls at all.

11:43.202 --> 11:46.205
<i>It had a front door and offices</i>
<i>and bathrooms at the front,</i>

11:46.288 --> 11:48.249
<i>and then it was just an open warehouse.</i>

11:51.961 --> 11:53.921
RALSTON: <i>We didn't even have</i>
<i>the whole building.</i>

11:54.046 --> 11:57.550
<i>There was an auto mechanic right</i>
<i>next to us and somebody else next to that.</i>

11:57.633 --> 12:00.136
<i>There was an open vacant field outside</i>

12:00.219 --> 12:02.138
where we actually blew up stuff
for a while.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.181
No frills, believe me.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.393
JOHNSTON: <i>I remember</i>
<i>one of the producers said,</i>

12:07.893 --> 12:10.062
"Well, you know,
we'll never fill this up."

12:10.813 --> 12:14.442
<i>And within six weeks we had already</i>
<i>started building the second floor.</i>

12:15.317 --> 12:17.695
RALSTON: <i>I mean, it was</i>
<i>a lot of just mundane stuff</i>

12:17.778 --> 12:19.989
we had to take care of
as it started to take form.

12:20.072 --> 12:23.367
I can still remember the pieces
to the Dykstraflex showing up,

12:23.576 --> 12:28.330
and we were all sitting around going,
"How did this go together?" (CHUCKLING)

12:32.543 --> 12:36.964
We had to get going really quickly,
and somebody came up with the idea,

12:37.047 --> 12:40.092
well, if the carpenters
would give us 2x4s,

12:40.176 --> 12:43.763
we would just lay out the rooms,
and where the doorways would be,

12:43.929 --> 12:45.347
without doing drawings.

12:45.765 --> 12:50.227
<i>And so they just started building walls</i>
<i>and everything where we said.</i>

12:51.645 --> 12:55.316
You know, I'd arrive in the morning and
the 2x4s would be moved over two feet

12:55.399 --> 12:59.153
into my department, you know, to make
someone's hallway a little bit wider.

13:00.029 --> 13:05.284
The model shop was not quite big enough

13:05.701 --> 13:08.621
<i>and there was a hallway where they put</i>

13:08.704 --> 13:13.292
all the drill presses and bandsaws,
and it was just like...

13:13.918 --> 13:16.504
That's a huge mistake (LAUGHING)
you know,

13:16.587 --> 13:19.298
'cause there's just a lot of traffic
going through them.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.967
<i>And it was just waiting</i>
<i>for an accident to happen.</i>

13:22.218 --> 13:25.137
So I made a mold of my index finger

13:25.304 --> 13:29.934
and cast it and painted it up
and painted the stump to look bloody

13:30.601 --> 13:33.604
and put it on the bandsaw
and just left it there.

13:34.313 --> 13:39.151
And, you know, days later,
(LAUGHS) the saw was gone.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.368
We've got a tour of the facility up here,

13:47.493 --> 13:49.620
then went back to where George was working

13:49.703 --> 13:52.998
and saw the artwork
that had been done or was being done,

13:53.499 --> 13:57.503
by Joe Johnston and Ralph McQuarrie
had also been working on.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.053
<i>That was just stunning,</i>
<i>the work for</i> Empire.

14:06.136 --> 14:11.225
<i>This was just really a big step</i>
<i>beyond what</i> Star Wars <i>was.</i>

14:13.185 --> 14:16.021
<i>From the scale of the film</i>
<i>to the scale of the effects,</i>

14:17.773 --> 14:20.067
<i>all these different</i>
<i>locations that all needed</i>

14:20.150 --> 14:21.610
<i>to be problem solved.</i>

14:23.445 --> 14:28.701
We knew we had to top <i>Star Wars,</i>
and that's no mean feat.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.454
It was a little bit scary,

14:33.873 --> 14:36.584
<i>and a thousand percent exciting.</i>

14:41.130 --> 14:42.798
It was pretty overwhelming

14:42.882 --> 14:46.635
when I arrived to work
on <i>The Empire Strikes Back.</i>

14:46.969 --> 14:51.682
I had done matte paintings on <i>Star Wars</i>

14:51.765 --> 14:56.520
and probably there's only
about a dozen in the movie.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.981
<i>Maybe not even that many.</i>

14:59.857 --> 15:06.196
But suddenly... Oh, God, I had 150,
I don't remember.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.283
One of the difficulties,
of course, was to staff it.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.078
Because they had to re-staff the company,
and I was a supervisor.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.165
You know, in <i>Star Wars,</i>
we didn't really know what we were doing.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.791
Now we knew what we were doing

15:17.875 --> 15:19.835
and we had to do it again
and do it better.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.963
PETERSON: <i>You know, my mother</i>
<i>was interested in what I was doing,</i>

15:23.130 --> 15:27.593
and I'm working on budgets and scheduling,
you know, working with a calculator

15:27.676 --> 15:31.847
and you know the calendars
and she said, "Well, how much money?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.766
"What are you talking about money?"

15:33.849 --> 15:36.393
And I said, "Well, I think my budget

15:36.477 --> 15:39.855
"for this year is going to be
about three million," and it just...

15:40.856 --> 15:44.693
All of a sudden, I knew that
she wanted to end the conversation

15:44.777 --> 15:46.278
and go off to the neighbors

15:46.362 --> 15:48.864
and somehow blend that
into the conversation

15:48.948 --> 15:54.036
that her son was working on the budgets
for that next year at $3 million.

15:54.578 --> 15:58.707
I lived in San Rafael,
and I actually hadn't seen <i>Star Wars.</i>

15:58.791 --> 16:00.167
I didn't get out much.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.002
<i>I was looking for a job.</i>

16:02.086 --> 16:06.215
<i>I had two young kids,</i>
<i>and I saw this ad in the paper</i>

16:06.298 --> 16:08.759
for a receptionist
and assistant bookkeeper.

16:09.426 --> 16:13.389
<i>So I met with Jane Bay,</i>
<i>who had just recently been hired</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:15.808
<i>as George's executive assistant.</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:19.895
I was just really going in for a job,
I never anticipated

16:20.813 --> 16:21.814
getting a career.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.234
Thought didn't enter my mind.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.404
<i>Joe came in '78.</i>

16:28.487 --> 16:33.617
He was the first ILMer I met
and, you know,

16:33.701 --> 16:36.245
the first real artist
I think I'd ever met.

16:36.328 --> 16:40.499
I mean, you know, there wasn't a whole lot
to do at first.

16:40.582 --> 16:44.878
George hadn't finished the script yet.
He had some sequences.

16:45.004 --> 16:50.175
One of them was
the battle on Hoth, the ice planet.

16:51.176 --> 16:57.141
<i>And George said,</i>
<i>"Just draw some interesting shots."</i>

16:57.683 --> 17:04.148
The rebels are here and the Imperial Army
is coming on this ice plane

17:04.648 --> 17:07.985
and I remember him showing me a clip

17:08.068 --> 17:11.947
from the Eisenstein film <i>Alexander Nevsky,</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:15.200
<i>which is the beginning</i>
<i>of this battle on the ice.</i>

17:20.664 --> 17:25.878
<i>And he had this shot where it's just</i>
<i>the ice plane and you can't see anything.</i>

17:27.629 --> 17:30.966
And then way off in the distance,
you see those tiny little figures

17:31.508 --> 17:32.634
<i>marching toward you.</i>

17:33.135 --> 17:36.722
<i>And I remember him distinctly saying,</i>

17:38.140 --> 17:41.935
"I don't want it to look like this.
I want it to feel like this."

17:43.103 --> 17:46.190
<i>You know, they might be five miles away,</i>
<i>but you know they're coming</i>

17:46.273 --> 17:47.524
<i>and they can't be stopped.</i>

17:55.449 --> 17:57.576
TIPPETT: <i>George knew he wanted</i>
<i>this big snow battle.</i>

17:58.494 --> 18:01.747
And it had yet to be determined,
you know, the process.

18:01.830 --> 18:06.752
So there were designs that Joe had done,
wheeled radio controlled vehicles,

18:06.835 --> 18:13.801
or Gary Kurtz wanted to gussy up
Norwegian tanks, you know, and...

18:14.301 --> 18:18.597
JOHNSTON: <i>We had a design for the Imperial</i>
<i>vehicle that had treads on it.</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:22.726
And Gary had arranged
with the Norwegian army

18:24.144 --> 18:28.857
<i>to borrow, like, six tanks or something.</i>

18:29.817 --> 18:33.570
He gave me a picture of the tank
that they were going to borrow,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.698
<i>and he says, "Design something</i>
<i>that we can cover this with</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:38.117
<i>"that doesn't look like a tank."</i>

18:38.242 --> 18:41.161
<i>And I said, "Okay, well,</i>
<i>it's going to look like a tank</i>

18:41.245 --> 18:44.123
<i>"if you see treads, it's always</i>
<i>going to feel like a tank."</i>

18:44.706 --> 18:46.291
So all this stuff was flying around,

18:46.375 --> 18:50.254
and I think pretty much
Dennis convinced George

18:50.337 --> 18:54.299
<i>to do it stop motion,</i>
<i>in that we had total control</i>

18:54.383 --> 18:56.635
<i>over everything,</i>
<i>and these things were machines,</i>

18:56.718 --> 19:00.347
and it would lend itself
to stop motion work

19:00.430 --> 19:03.308
in a believable, you know, kind of a way.

19:04.351 --> 19:08.105
JOHNSTON: <i>I found this brochure from</i>
<i>the U.S. Steel Corporation,</i>

19:08.438 --> 19:10.357
and they had produced
this thing in the '60s.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.860
They were illustrations by Syd Mead.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.492
<i>And it was all about, "This is what steel</i>
<i>is going to be in the future.</i>

19:20.784 --> 19:22.911
<i>And his illustrations were really amazing.</i>

19:24.163 --> 19:25.914
<i>This portfolio was fantastic.</i>

19:27.332 --> 19:30.169
<i>U.S. Steel would give it to you</i>
<i>if you just requested it.</i>

19:30.669 --> 19:34.006
So everybody in the industrial
design department had one of these

19:34.089 --> 19:37.885
portfolios tacked to the wall,
you know, just to

19:39.303 --> 19:41.930
make them sad that they couldn't
paint that way, but...

19:42.973 --> 19:47.227
<i>And one of the illustrations was...</i>
<i>They called it... It was a truck,</i>

19:47.311 --> 19:49.438
but it was a four-legged truck.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.195
<i>And it was walking through</i>
<i>the woods in the snow,</i>

19:56.486 --> 19:57.946
and I said, "That's it."

19:59.156 --> 20:02.743
<i>Instead of a truck, we're going to make</i>
<i>a military vehicle out of it.</i>

20:02.826 --> 20:06.371
<i>So, I studied military vehicles,</i>
<i>you know, to look at detail.</i>

20:06.455 --> 20:11.335
<i>And I said, "Okay, once we've got</i>
<i>this thing on four legs,</i>

20:11.960 --> 20:15.631
"we have to make an anthropomorphic,
it has to look like it is a creature."

20:17.132 --> 20:21.595
TIPPETT: <i>And Joe, I guess, kind of</i>
<i>imagined, like a dinosaur kind of effect.</i>

20:22.387 --> 20:24.806
It was actually a huge prehistoric mammal

20:24.890 --> 20:27.434
called a <i>Baluchitherium</i> which was kind of

20:28.101 --> 20:30.395
<i>the conceptual model for the thing.</i>

20:32.022 --> 20:34.441
JOHNSTON: <i>Let's put the cockpit</i>
<i>out in front on a neck.</i>

20:35.317 --> 20:38.862
And it can look around,
and it's got these gun ports

20:38.946 --> 20:40.614
<i>that they sort of look like eyes.</i>

20:41.198 --> 20:44.826
<i>And it's got these guns underneath it,</i>
<i>you know, almost look like teeth.</i>

20:45.077 --> 20:48.288
While he was working on that,
Jon Berg was doing prototypes

20:48.372 --> 20:52.084
<i>for how the walkers could function</i>
<i>as a stop motion character.</i>

20:52.668 --> 20:56.672
<i>Because they wanted to have all these</i>
<i>kind of self-animating gears in it.</i>

20:56.797 --> 21:02.386
So when you move the leg, you see things
on his, you know, knees rotating

21:02.469 --> 21:05.097
or pistons going up and down
that we didn't have to animate

21:05.180 --> 21:07.432
'cause Jon had engineered
all that stuff that

21:07.516 --> 21:10.185
<i>when you moved the leg,</i>
<i>all these things would happen.</i>

21:11.728 --> 21:14.356
JOHNSTON: (LAUGHS) <i>So we abandoned</i>
<i>the whole tank idea</i>

21:14.439 --> 21:17.943
because that wasn't going to
work anyway, I don't think.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.030
TIPPETT: <i>On</i> Empire,

21:22.489 --> 21:26.493
<i>I did not feel that I was at the place</i>

21:26.576 --> 21:28.537
I needed to be skill-wise.

21:29.079 --> 21:33.125
But fortunately, Dennis found
the very first reel to reel,

21:33.500 --> 21:35.669
<i>single frame tape recorders.</i>

21:35.752 --> 21:40.382
<i>And so I was able to, you know,</i>
<i>do a mockup of the walkers.</i>

21:41.008 --> 21:43.969
And I just practiced.
It was like playing the piano.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.179
I just did the scales every day,

21:46.263 --> 21:50.892
<i>eight to ten hours,</i>
<i>and it was like learning</i>

21:50.976 --> 21:55.522
<i>to ride a bike over, like,</i>
<i>six months unsuccessfully.</i>

21:55.605 --> 21:59.359
And then, all of a sudden, I get it.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.739
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

22:03.822 --> 22:05.532
All right, boys, keep tight now.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.954
Hobbie, you still with me?

22:51.495 --> 22:56.416
When I arrived at Kerner,
the first thing I saw

22:56.500 --> 23:00.587
when I walked in there,
there is Phil Tippett,

23:00.837 --> 23:04.883
<i>doing stop motions on the walkers.</i>

23:05.759 --> 23:09.971
<i>And this set was amazing.</i>

23:10.555 --> 23:14.476
I thought at that point,
"What have I gotten myself into?"

23:15.227 --> 23:18.855
I just didn't want to be
the weak link in the chain.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.400
I didn't want people to say,

23:21.483 --> 23:25.612
"Hmm, good movie,
except for those matte paintings.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.614
"What happened there?"

23:28.365 --> 23:31.827
TIPPETT: <i>Over some of the big shots</i>
<i>in</i> Empire, <i>there was one of them,</i>

23:31.910 --> 23:36.289
<i>it was pretty grueling</i>
<i>because the set was maybe 40x40,</i>

23:36.373 --> 23:39.042
<i>and there was a big Pangrazio</i>
<i>painted background,</i>

23:39.167 --> 23:40.710
and there were two walkers in it.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.923
And the ship goes down and flies through
the legs of one and comes up and strafes

23:45.006 --> 23:47.926
the other one and flies off.
And it's a point of view.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.097
And it was going to require two animators

23:52.180 --> 23:55.851
<i>and Jon Berg got the flu that day.</i>

23:56.101 --> 23:58.311
And we had to move off the set
the next day

23:58.395 --> 24:02.190
and make it free for something else.
So I got to do both of them.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.905
<i>The set was on,</i>
<i>like, three or four foot risers.</i>

24:09.322 --> 24:10.991
I would get on my hands and knees

24:11.074 --> 24:13.577
and go down to the first trap door,
open it up.

24:13.743 --> 24:18.123
<i>Animate, animate, animate,</i>
<i>and because of the scale</i>

24:18.206 --> 24:20.917
<i>and the slowness</i>
<i>of the speed of the walkers,</i>

24:22.002 --> 24:26.548
<i>a lot of the movements</i>
<i>just had to be felt.</i>

24:26.631 --> 24:28.717
<i>You couldn't gauge them, you know.</i>

24:28.842 --> 24:31.761
You couldn't even see them.
You just had to...

24:31.845 --> 24:36.266
I think I moved it, yeah, a millimeter,

24:37.267 --> 24:41.438
and take, like, whatever it took,
like 20 minutes to do all that stuff.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.814
I mean, click, go down,

24:42.898 --> 24:45.317
get on my hands and knees,
go down to the next one,

24:45.400 --> 24:47.694
open the trap door and repeat the process.

24:49.029 --> 24:53.408
<i>Over and over and over</i>
<i>and over forever.</i>

24:56.369 --> 24:59.414
Fortunately, the shot
wasn't that long, so... (CHUCKLES)

25:01.082 --> 25:03.210
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

25:08.590 --> 25:10.550
EDLUND: Okay.
Why don't we hit the blue screen?

25:12.052 --> 25:13.803
Okay, that's... Oh, oh, oh.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.430
Okay, right there.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.099
All right, let it go.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.061
MAN: Bang, bang.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.854
-Yeah, that's it.
-All right.

25:23.897 --> 25:28.485
Well, <i>Empire,</i> that was like
graduate level compositing.

25:29.110 --> 25:33.114
In other words, we had done
undergraduate work on <i>Star Wars.</i>

25:35.283 --> 25:39.663
<i>It's fairly easy to matte a rocket ship</i>
<i>over star fields,</i>

25:39.746 --> 25:41.581
because it's mostly black anyway.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.709
and, you know, you wouldn't see
a matte line, frankly.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.963
There's certain shots that did have
a few matte lines in <i>Star Wars.</i>

25:55.345 --> 25:59.140
But in <i>Empire,</i>
there could not be any matte lines.

26:00.517 --> 26:03.979
<i>You had now landspeeders,</i>
<i>which are light gray</i>

26:04.479 --> 26:07.399
<i>and they're flying against</i>
<i>white snow background,</i>

26:07.816 --> 26:11.194
<i>fluffy white clouds,</i>
<i>pale blue sky, I mean,</i>

26:11.319 --> 26:14.114
it was like, you couldn't
have a matte line

26:14.197 --> 26:17.158
in the shot or the 10-year-olds say,
"Hey, that looks funny."

26:17.242 --> 26:20.620
You know? I mean, the 10-year-old
is one of our most severe critics.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.708
Because if it doesn't work,
if it doesn't look right,

26:24.833 --> 26:27.919
he's not buying the shot
and you're losing him for the scene.

26:28.044 --> 26:32.674
And so I had to build a special
optical printer to deal with this problem.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.765
RALSTON: <i>An optical printer</i>
<i>is this giant machine.</i>

26:41.433 --> 26:47.188
It's all using film,
it's taking multiple pieces of film,

26:47.272 --> 26:50.692
<i>and running through this process,</i>
<i>all lined up</i>

26:50.775 --> 26:52.819
and pushed together like this.

26:53.903 --> 26:54.988
<i>It's not two pieces.</i>

26:55.071 --> 26:58.658
<i>It's multiple pieces of film,</i>
<i>multiple pieces of mattes</i>

26:58.742 --> 27:01.494
<i>that have been created to combine images</i>

27:01.578 --> 27:03.830
<i>of a background plate</i>
<i>and a foreground image.</i>

27:04.247 --> 27:08.084
<i>All kinds of things that have to all</i>
<i>be sandwiched into this machine</i>

27:08.585 --> 27:11.921
<i>and run through</i>
<i>one single frame at a time.</i>

27:12.339 --> 27:14.007
<i>And it's being re-photographed.</i>

27:14.883 --> 27:18.928
The camera is essentially photographing
what goes through these projectors.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.682
Normally, you would only
have two projectors,

27:23.808 --> 27:27.896
and this one has four projectors,
so we can run more images at one time.

27:28.396 --> 27:32.150
That just gives us
more flexibility and more capability

27:32.233 --> 27:34.319
to composite many images at once.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.238
EDLUND: <i>It was really a big project.</i>

27:37.572 --> 27:42.661
<i>Using telecentric optics, which created</i>
<i>parallel rays coming out of the lens.</i>

27:43.036 --> 27:45.372
<i>So you don't have geometric distortion,</i>

27:45.622 --> 27:48.291
<i>which is the harbinger of matte lines.</i>

27:49.209 --> 27:51.044
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

27:56.091 --> 27:58.677
<i>Empire</i> was really gratifying

27:58.760 --> 28:02.263
<i>because I felt that we had</i>
<i>conquered the evil matte line.</i>

28:04.933 --> 28:08.269
What you see behind me here
is our production boards.

28:09.020 --> 28:13.400
And many times we're compositing
as many as 15-20 elements together.

28:14.234 --> 28:18.530
So here one would mean original negative,
three would mean an explosion,

28:18.613 --> 28:22.325
and 22 means a particular kind of speeder.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.037
The master board
then gives us an indication

28:26.121 --> 28:29.374
of how many shots have not been approved
finally by George.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.754
On this film, we're attempting things
that are extremely difficult.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.675
I mean, much, much more difficult than
anything we ever tried in the first film.

28:38.758 --> 28:42.679
We're doing a lot more stop-motion,
which is difficult.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.849
And we're experimenting more and more

28:45.932 --> 28:50.979
with video and computer technology
to try to advance the art of film,

28:51.479 --> 28:53.940
and to make it easier to express yourself.

28:54.023 --> 28:58.278
When I was working on <i>Star Wars,</i>
we did some digital shots.

28:58.361 --> 29:01.406
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia

29:01.656 --> 29:04.659
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.954
GEORGE: <i>You know, the demonstration</i>
<i>of the </i>Death Star,<i> where it has to go,</i>

29:08.037 --> 29:11.166
and all that kind of stuff, I said,
"This is the way of the future."

29:11.249 --> 29:12.834
(BEEPING)

29:12.917 --> 29:14.794
<i>But it was a little bit early.</i>

29:15.628 --> 29:21.050
The film industry was
in the 19th century, 18th century,

29:21.134 --> 29:24.304
<i>and you look at it and say,</i>
<i>"Well, this is stupid. We have computers."</i>

29:24.387 --> 29:27.056
JOHNSTON: <i>And George was very much</i>
<i>a proponent of that.</i>

29:27.140 --> 29:29.684
And once digital became a viable thing,

29:29.768 --> 29:33.772
he was always, you know,
pushing the envelope on that stuff.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.483
The thing I really wanted to do
was digitize editing.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.734
<i>That was my big thing.</i>

29:39.319 --> 29:40.320
If Dwayne were here.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.739
<i>Oh, it's frustrating in the editing room.</i>

29:42.822 --> 29:44.949
<i>I said, "This doesn't have to be this way.</i>

29:45.074 --> 29:46.242
<i>"This is crazy."</i>

29:46.326 --> 29:47.452
Oh...

29:48.077 --> 29:51.664
And I said I want to be able
to go from top to bottom all digital.

29:52.373 --> 29:56.419
See if you can find somebody
to head up the computer division.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.969
My father grew up on a dirt farm in Idaho.

30:07.639 --> 30:12.310
He was one of 14 children,
only nine of whom lived to adulthood.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.771
My father was very smart and driven,

30:14.854 --> 30:18.316
and he got his degree in Education
to be a teacher.

30:19.484 --> 30:23.488
<i>He brought us out to Salt Lake City</i>
<i>at a phenomenal period of time.</i>

30:25.156 --> 30:27.659
<i>Growing up in the '50s,</i>

30:28.368 --> 30:35.250
<i>the iconic figures of that time,</i>
<i>were Walt Disney and Albert Einstein.</i>

30:37.001 --> 30:39.003
All right, so Walt Disney's on television.

30:39.087 --> 30:42.465
<i>Will there be mechanical robots</i>
<i>controlled by superintelligent beings?</i>

30:42.549 --> 30:45.301
CATMULL: <i>And at the same time,</i>
<i>Albert Einstein,</i>

30:45.677 --> 30:49.722
<i>and the ideas of relativity</i>
<i>in all those areas of physics</i>

30:49.806 --> 30:53.852
were very fascinating,
so I held both of them,

30:54.561 --> 30:56.563
but I actually wanted to be an animator.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.735
<i>The background for this is</i>
<i>we've got the Cold War going on</i>

31:03.111 --> 31:06.990
<i>and the government had</i>
<i>this brilliant idea,</i>

31:07.699 --> 31:09.492
and that was, they were going to fund

31:09.576 --> 31:12.328
students and universities
around the United States

31:12.662 --> 31:17.041
for the development of computer science,
and it was what was then called ARPA.

31:17.834 --> 31:23.339
<i>Advanced Research Project Agency.</i>
<i>In fact, the Internet came out of ARPA,</i>

31:24.340 --> 31:28.303
<i>but it was first called Arpanet,</i>
<i>and the University of Utah</i>

31:28.386 --> 31:32.265
<i>was one of the first four nodes</i>
<i>on this network.</i>

31:32.640 --> 31:37.312
<i>So I entered The University of Utah,</i>
<i>and got a degree in computer science.</i>

31:37.854 --> 31:42.025
<i>The earliest computers were for financing,</i>
<i>bookkeeping and so forth.</i>

31:42.442 --> 31:45.612
But they can imagine at some point
it's going to be bigger than that,

31:45.695 --> 31:46.946
we will need picture making.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.031
<i>In graduate school,</i>

31:48.114 --> 31:52.493
the very first class I took
was one in computer graphics.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.163
It was like... Gong! Holy cow!

31:55.371 --> 31:58.625
You can make pictures here,
we could do animation.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.836
<i>And all of a sudden, bam,</i>
<i>everything took shape.</i>

32:02.086 --> 32:05.381
<i>So I thought, well, I'm going</i>
<i>to try to animate my hand.</i>

32:06.591 --> 32:11.179
So I made a plaster mold of my hand,
learning the hard way

32:11.262 --> 32:13.932
that you should put Vaseline
on the back of your hand first.

32:14.349 --> 32:18.728
So I'm sitting there with a razor
trying to cut the hair

32:18.811 --> 32:20.980
<i>to get my hand out of the mold.</i>

32:22.440 --> 32:24.734
<i>And then I digitized it.</i>

32:26.444 --> 32:28.488
<i>I went from wire frame to polygonal,</i>

32:29.113 --> 32:32.450
<i>and then I wrote the software</i>
<i>in order to be able to animate it.</i>

32:36.955 --> 32:39.332
At this time,
it was mind-blowing for people.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.420
<i>I believed, at the time,</i>
<i>that we were ten years away</i>

32:45.046 --> 32:47.173
<i>from being able to make an animated film.</i>

32:48.132 --> 32:50.343
<i>You had this list of things</i>
<i>that you had to solve.</i>

32:51.177 --> 32:53.763
And at the beginning,
you don't know what the answers are,

32:53.846 --> 32:55.264
you just know, that's a problem.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.518
<i>And I didn't even know</i>
<i>what all the problems were,</i>

32:58.893 --> 33:01.396
but the ones immediately in front
were really big.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.315
So who's going to support this?

33:05.775 --> 33:09.821
<i>Out of the blue, we get contacted that</i>
<i>Lucasfilm was looking for somebody</i>

33:09.904 --> 33:11.739
<i>to bring technology</i>
<i>into the film industry.</i>

33:11.906 --> 33:13.825
Richard Edlund came out.

33:14.033 --> 33:17.870
We're trying to keep this whole
conversation a secret that's going on,

33:17.954 --> 33:21.833
<i>but Richard, of course, got this big</i>
<i>belt buckle which says</i> "<i>Star Wars" on it.</i>

33:23.126 --> 33:24.919
And he's talking to an artist,

33:25.294 --> 33:29.465
who is inherently extremely observant,
who calls out the belt buckle.

33:30.425 --> 33:35.221
<i>He's just a friendly person</i>
<i>who's also very interested in everything.</i>

33:36.014 --> 33:39.934
<i>So he's now seeing for the first time</i>
<i>computer painting,</i>

33:40.518 --> 33:42.478
and it's completely wrapped up into it.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.648
So he realized that something
important is happening there.

33:45.732 --> 33:49.444
The first problem we solved was
how to describe an object to the computer.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.655
The simplest way to do that is
to just draw it off on graph paper.

33:52.739 --> 33:56.159
This is just a cross-sectional view
of one half a simple cup shape.

33:56.242 --> 33:59.495
And a computer can then spin this around
to make a surface of revolution

33:59.579 --> 34:01.706
of what it would look like
from different views.

34:05.543 --> 34:09.088
Now, this sort of picture is made
of an array of little spots on the screen

34:09.172 --> 34:10.173
which are called pixels.

34:13.468 --> 34:16.721
You can see here individually,
each pixel magnified

34:17.555 --> 34:19.348
to be a little square.

34:19.432 --> 34:22.226
The idea here is that each square
has a number stuck in it.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.812
And the brighter the pixel,
the larger the number.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.357
And so the computer program then
has to figure out what value

34:28.441 --> 34:30.943
or what number to stick
in each of these little spots.

34:32.361 --> 34:34.697
EDLUND: <i>With digital manipulation,</i>

34:35.239 --> 34:41.704
the fact is that now, the visual effects
artist has at his disposal

34:42.121 --> 34:44.457
millions of addressable pixels.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.835
<i>You can address each point in the frame,</i>

34:48.044 --> 34:50.963
and because of that,
nothing is impossible.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.841
Once we got digital,
you could do anything.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.760
Absolutely anything.

34:56.177 --> 34:59.263
When I first met George,
they were working on <i>Empire Strikes Back.</i>

34:59.347 --> 35:02.183
The state of the art
was pretty primitive at the time.

35:04.977 --> 35:07.271
<i>He said he wanted digital audio.</i>

35:08.648 --> 35:14.779
He wanted video editing, and he wanted
some digital imaging for compositing.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.116
<i>George believed that</i>
<i>the world was changing,</i>

35:18.199 --> 35:19.992
and technology would change everything.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.578
It was as simple as that,
he was just open to it.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.956
And he was willing
to put the money behind it.

35:25.748 --> 35:28.668
Now, anybody that had done
a deep analysis at the time,

35:29.544 --> 35:31.796
would have said,
"That doesn't make any sense.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.881
"It's too far away."

35:33.965 --> 35:36.717
<i>But for George, it was like,</i>
<i>"I got to start somewhere."</i>

35:37.802 --> 35:39.929
I still don't know how to work a computer.

35:40.179 --> 35:44.559
I barely know how to work my cell phone,
but I know what I want to have happen.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.270
<i>And I can talk to somebody,</i>

35:47.937 --> 35:50.439
<i>and they can say, "That's impossible."</i>

35:51.649 --> 35:53.568
And I can say, "Well, think about it."

35:54.402 --> 35:58.656
After working with George for a while,
I began to understand the way he thought,

35:59.615 --> 36:04.579
and the way he told the story in pictures.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.539
As the fighters go in, we assume that

36:06.622 --> 36:08.958
-the Rebel cruisers also start to go in.
-Yeah.

36:09.125 --> 36:13.462
We'd pin the storyboards on the wall,
and then he would go through

36:13.546 --> 36:16.257
with his red pen and he would say,

36:16.340 --> 36:19.093
"We don't need that. We don't need that.
Rip those down."

36:19.177 --> 36:23.264
And we learned very quickly
not to put the originals on the wall,

36:24.140 --> 36:27.101
<i>'cause he'd take a red pen</i>
<i>and draw right through it, you know.</i>

36:27.393 --> 36:29.145
Okay. Next.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.230
JOHNSTON: <i>You know, it was really like</i>

36:31.397 --> 36:34.317
<i>understanding the essence</i>
<i>of the storytelling</i>

36:34.400 --> 36:36.736
<i>by looking at the way</i>
<i>he would do these things.</i>

36:37.778 --> 36:40.990
It was really like going to some
film school that doesn't exist.

36:41.073 --> 36:43.951
You know, this fantasy film school
that you can only attend

36:44.035 --> 36:45.786
<i>by getting in the mind of this guy.</i>

36:47.163 --> 36:53.502
Storyboards really helped me out a lot
because I very rarely read scripts.

36:54.003 --> 36:59.508
Being dyslexic didn't help,
but I never liked the form that much.

37:03.054 --> 37:08.226
<i>You know, it was just very hard</i>
<i>for me to, like, see the movie.</i>

37:09.727 --> 37:11.062
So I would just wait.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.273
I would wait until it got to the place
where there were storyboards,

37:14.357 --> 37:18.486
or if George could explain,
"Yeah, it's kind of like this," you know.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.071
Then I would run with it.

37:21.405 --> 37:26.577
<i>Joe told me, "Hey, George is interested</i>
<i>in you coming up with some ideas</i>

37:26.661 --> 37:29.705
<i>"for this character</i>
<i>that's like a snow lizard."</i>

37:30.665 --> 37:34.418
So I spent a day just drawing,
like, really quickly.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.172
<i>It could be this, it could be that.</i>
<i>It could be this, it could be that.</i>

37:38.256 --> 37:43.511
And sent it to George, and he picked one
and asked for a maquette of it.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.016
<i>So I sculpted a little clay maquette.</i>

37:50.726 --> 37:52.520
<i>But you know, my design was mammalian.</i>

37:52.603 --> 37:55.231
<i>It had familiar aspects to it,</i>

37:55.314 --> 37:58.609
<i>like ram's horns</i>
<i>and kind of like a camel face,</i>

37:58.693 --> 38:00.903
<i>but not really, you know...</i>
<i>Two sets of nostrils,</i>

38:00.987 --> 38:03.614
but something that was identifiable.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.995
Phil Tippett knew he had to do
the tauntaun and he knew that unborn calf,

38:09.453 --> 38:13.916
the hairs on unborn calf
are much smaller than on a cow.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.752
You know, full cow,
or even a newborn calf.

38:17.503 --> 38:21.340
And so we went on pursuit

38:21.424 --> 38:25.428
of an unborn white calf, you know.

38:28.347 --> 38:31.726
<i>We went around to taxidermists.</i>
<i>We went around to slaughterhouses.</i>

38:32.059 --> 38:37.273
<i>And eventually we had to settle</i>
<i>on a white, already tanned hide.</i>

38:37.648 --> 38:39.567
And then there's an old process,

38:39.650 --> 38:42.069
<i>you know, from back</i>
<i>in the days of</i> King Kong,

38:42.445 --> 38:44.572
<i>in which what you do</i>
<i>is you take a white glue</i>

38:44.655 --> 38:48.492
<i>that's water-soluble,</i>
<i>and you wet the fur side,</i>

38:48.993 --> 38:51.203
<i>and then you put it</i>
<i>into a box with maggots.</i>

38:51.912 --> 38:53.998
<i>And the maggots eat away the flesh,</i>

38:54.248 --> 38:57.752
but they don't eat follicles
'cause there's no energy in a follicle.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.590
So now you have this matrix of white glue

39:02.965 --> 39:05.426
with these little follicles
sticking up out of it.

39:05.634 --> 39:08.971
And then what you do is you brush
in a thin layer of latex

39:09.055 --> 39:11.682
and you turn it over,
and then you use

39:11.891 --> 39:14.560
the water soluble glue and get it out,

39:14.643 --> 39:18.647
wash it out of the hair and now you have
an unborn calf that's stretchable.

39:21.942 --> 39:24.695
<i>So that's how the tauntaun was done.</i>

39:26.072 --> 39:28.199
But try to explain that to people,

39:28.282 --> 39:31.952
you know, at a slaughterhouse or
(CHUCKLES) at a taxidermy place.

39:32.036 --> 39:35.289
People must wonder if we're devil
worshipers or something like that.

39:37.041 --> 39:40.628
Well, I spent, like,
about 20 minutes trying to sculpt

39:40.711 --> 39:44.757
somethin' that looked kinda like Han,
figuring that you'd never ever see it.

39:45.424 --> 39:49.762
So we built this thing and we took it up
to George and showed it to him.

39:49.845 --> 39:53.015
Well, this is important 'cause this sort
of establishes the whole thing.

39:53.099 --> 39:56.894
Okay. So you think the running
forward shot will be...

39:57.019 --> 39:59.814
I think it'll be all right because
it's superimposed,

39:59.897 --> 40:02.608
and there's snow blowing in front of it
and all kinds of stuff.

40:02.691 --> 40:06.904
And I found that George responded
really well to three-dimensional stuff.

40:06.987 --> 40:08.155
Just in general.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.950
Yeah, he would just,
viscerally, it's done.

40:11.283 --> 40:14.787
A lot of times with 2D stuff,
you get into this conundrum and go,

40:14.870 --> 40:17.998
"Well, what if this one
had that one's tail

40:18.082 --> 40:21.210
"and that one's toe,"
but you get a kabam!

40:21.585 --> 40:23.337
You know, it's just right there.

40:23.629 --> 40:28.217
Maybe also just to make it darker
because of the scale.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.387
Not that I understand color on scale.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.849
TIPPETT: <i>To me, it's like kind of</i>
<i>a form of management</i>

40:34.932 --> 40:36.976
<i>that I learned working with George.</i>

40:37.476 --> 40:42.565
It's just to get creative people
to invest, make it theirs,

40:42.940 --> 40:46.694
and back away and let the creative people,
you know, run with it.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.738
I don't consider myself
a really good leader.

40:50.114 --> 40:54.201
<i>I picked people who were really good,</i>
<i>and of course I was probably saying no,</i>

40:54.493 --> 40:55.911
<i>much more than I'd say yes.</i>

40:55.995 --> 40:58.289
You know, if anything,
it would be better to have this

40:58.372 --> 41:01.041
-be slightly darker than this.
-Okay.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.461
I mean, that's a guess on my part.

41:04.503 --> 41:07.089
But I didn't yell at them.
I didn't scream,

41:07.173 --> 41:09.842
"What are you doing? You're an idiot,"
and all that kind of stuff.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.720
Mostly, I would just say,
"Look, try it, we'll see."

41:13.179 --> 41:15.764
We should maybe make it
slightly darker than this.

41:16.640 --> 41:20.144
And then it might, you know,
the perspective on it might be right.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.605
-Sure.
-Right.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.273
-Okay, yeah.
-Call me insane.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.775
No, no. Definitely do that.
I don't wanna...

41:26.984 --> 41:29.612
-I only wanna do it once.
-Right.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.325
MUREN: <i>One of the things</i>
<i>that I learned from George</i>

41:34.450 --> 41:37.369
that was, that's just
affected my entire life,

41:37.912 --> 41:41.332
is that we had a shot
in <i>Empire Strikes Back,</i>

41:41.957 --> 41:44.960
that he came in one day
and he had a helicopter view

41:45.044 --> 41:48.380
flying over this big ice field
that had been shot in Norway.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.341
<i>And the camera's flying over it,</i>

41:50.424 --> 41:53.010
and it kind of just looks
down on the ice field.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.929
And he said, "Can you put a tauntaun

41:55.012 --> 41:57.973
"running along like it's running
on the ice field down there?"

41:58.057 --> 42:02.228
And knowing, you know, the limitations
we had with camera rigs

42:02.311 --> 42:04.605
and making it look like
it's actually his feet

42:04.688 --> 42:06.732
are on the ground running and everything,

42:06.815 --> 42:10.319
I said, "No, you know, there's just
really no way that we could do it.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.155
"We could build a big giant set
and do it that way,

42:13.239 --> 42:16.575
"but that's gonna take a lot of time
and cost a lot of money."

42:16.659 --> 42:19.745
And he said, "Well,
why don't you just think about it?"

42:19.828 --> 42:22.748
And I said, "Yeah, okay,
but there's no way that we can do it

42:22.831 --> 42:24.208
"with the tools we have."

42:24.291 --> 42:27.127
"Okay, okay, just think about it,"
and he walked out.

42:27.419 --> 42:30.172
And I thought, "Well, jeez, okay,"
and I started thinking,

42:30.256 --> 42:32.841
and within 15 minutes, I'd figured it out.

42:33.259 --> 42:36.512
<i>How to do it with</i>
<i>the limited tool set we had,</i>

42:36.595 --> 42:39.014
<i>but a clever way of putting</i>
<i>stuff together again.</i>

42:39.848 --> 42:42.851
<i>There were no new tools.</i>
<i>It was just an approach.</i>

42:43.435 --> 42:47.898
<i>We shot the tauntaun model first,</i>
<i>and it was tracked frame by frame.</i>

42:48.774 --> 42:50.901
<i>And then with the aerial plate background,</i>

42:51.360 --> 42:55.239
<i>and the actual piece of film</i>
<i>is re-photographed in each new position,</i>

42:55.322 --> 42:58.826
based on the tauntaun
and then combined in.

42:59.326 --> 43:02.371
So it meant you could do composites
with big moving cameras.

43:07.418 --> 43:11.922
And the amazing thing about it was
it was very clear that

43:12.506 --> 43:15.593
before I could verbalize
how I had figured it out,

43:16.093 --> 43:18.721
my body had figured it out,
and I just felt it.

43:19.263 --> 43:20.598
"Oh."

43:20.681 --> 43:23.142
And then I started thinking about
what did I just feel?

43:23.225 --> 43:25.019
And yeah, that fits with that.

43:25.144 --> 43:27.521
And this fits with that.
And that fits with that.

43:27.646 --> 43:31.650
Which means I guess your subconscious is
like working on this thing or something.

43:31.734 --> 43:36.864
And if I'd stopped thinking
one minute and 59 seconds before,

43:36.947 --> 43:40.659
I wouldn't have thought about it
that last little bit.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.370
When Dennis is working on a problem,

43:43.454 --> 43:45.664
you don't know how
to solve it to begin with.

43:45.831 --> 43:49.418
So there's actually a thing that some
people have and some people don't have,

43:49.501 --> 43:51.962
is that when you're starting,
you don't have the answer.

43:52.046 --> 43:55.341
And now when you're talking with
somebody else who actually gets,

43:55.424 --> 43:58.135
that you don't know
what the solution is when you start,

43:58.218 --> 44:00.512
then you have a different
kind of relationship,

44:00.721 --> 44:02.765
and it's like, okay,
you can become partners

44:02.848 --> 44:05.768
in solving the problem,
and that's who Dennis is.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.814
(BRAYING)

44:11.357 --> 44:16.028
The whole idea
of making something real,

44:16.236 --> 44:21.075
is like a kind of a hard path to pursue.

44:21.784 --> 44:25.371
<i>But, you know, I have an obsessive side</i>

44:25.454 --> 44:28.999
that I just look forward
to doing this stuff.

44:29.083 --> 44:33.045
When I wake up in the morning,
when I'm doing it, I get super excited.

44:34.004 --> 44:36.674
<i>By the end of the day,</i>
<i>I'm like too much for myself.</i>

44:37.341 --> 44:40.386
Yeah, I'm exhausted and I have to have
like, two or three beers

44:40.469 --> 44:42.888
to calm down.

44:43.138 --> 44:48.352
But what I've just
recently figured out is

44:48.811 --> 44:52.189
I've always had depression and anxiety
all throughout my life.

44:55.150 --> 44:59.863
<i>The anxiety was never</i>
<i>motivated by anything.</i>

45:00.155 --> 45:02.991
<i>It would just come like a storm.</i>

45:04.618 --> 45:06.704
<i>Like, I was plugged into a 220V.</i>

45:07.246 --> 45:09.081
And it was just like "Ahhh!"

45:10.040 --> 45:14.586
<i>I realized if I made stuff,</i>
<i>and get out of my mind,</i>

45:15.462 --> 45:16.755
I could...

45:17.506 --> 45:20.175
I was cured. The storm would just go away.

45:32.312 --> 45:35.482
<i>That was my self-narrative</i>

45:36.233 --> 45:40.154
<i>that I kind of thought was operating</i>

45:40.237 --> 45:44.491
until just really recently,
when all of a sudden

45:44.575 --> 45:49.621
it occurred to me,
that I might be bipolar,

45:50.414 --> 45:53.417
and, um, I am. (LAUGHS)

45:54.752 --> 45:58.172
<i>The key therapy that I think</i>
<i>that has helped me...</i>

45:59.381 --> 46:02.551
<i>I'm very process-driven.</i>

46:03.761 --> 46:06.346
Everything really, you know, is

46:06.430 --> 46:08.932
you do one thing, then you do the next,
you do the next.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.143
You're going to make a stop-motion puppet.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.563
You build an armature,
then you put clay over it,

46:14.646 --> 46:16.982
then you make a mold,
then you cast in the latex.

46:17.065 --> 46:19.276
You trim it, you... (SPEAKS GIBBERISH)

46:19.818 --> 46:22.529
<i>So you have to, you know,</i>
<i>have, like, all these skills,</i>

46:22.780 --> 46:26.992
and it really is like a form of alchemy,
you know, you really do feel like that.

46:27.075 --> 46:28.327
And then you get on the stage

46:28.410 --> 46:30.746
<i>and it's all blacked off</i>
<i>and it's all quiet.</i>

46:31.705 --> 46:34.166
<i>And you just got lights and a puppet,</i>

46:34.249 --> 46:36.960
<i>and you're bringing it to life,</i>
<i>one frame at a time.</i>

46:40.214 --> 46:43.634
<i>And this is being shot</i>
<i>in stop-motion photography,</i>

46:43.926 --> 46:50.349
where one frame of film is shot for every,
you know, infinitesimal movement.

46:51.183 --> 46:55.646
So in, like, one frame of film,
if this guy is running along,

46:55.729 --> 46:57.898
his back leg has to be moved...

46:58.982 --> 47:00.776
(GRUNTS) A little bit like that.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.904
And his foreleg has to like, come forward.

47:05.656 --> 47:09.618
And his head has to go down
and maybe up a little bit.

47:10.285 --> 47:12.412
All of his bags have to be moved.

47:12.955 --> 47:17.960
The rider has to rock on the saddle
in relationship to whether this guy's

47:18.043 --> 47:19.586
going up or down.

47:19.795 --> 47:23.632
And all the little pieces of filigree
on the saddle are moved, too.

47:25.050 --> 47:30.597
People ask, you know, "Don't you find it
boring or tedious to do that stuff?"

47:30.889 --> 47:35.143
and... "No, What are you talking about?"
(LAUGHS)

47:35.227 --> 47:37.896
Because you get in the zone.

47:41.817 --> 47:44.820
<i>You know,</i>
<i>and it's a form of meditation, really.</i>

47:45.028 --> 47:50.659
<i>And you are just slowing time</i>

47:50.742 --> 47:56.248
<i>way down</i>
<i>and you're not even aware of it at all.</i>

47:58.292 --> 47:59.418
And...

48:00.586 --> 48:06.341
I think that's kept me from
you know, killing myself.

48:17.394 --> 48:18.812
(BLEATS)

48:23.942 --> 48:26.194
(WIND BLOWING)

48:28.030 --> 48:30.866
(BRAYING)

48:35.579 --> 48:39.124
Here are a few of the matte paintings
we're using on <i>Empire Strikes Back.</i>

48:39.207 --> 48:41.960
This is an example of one
that is an interior

48:42.044 --> 48:44.671
of Darth Vader's Star Destroyer bridge,

48:44.755 --> 48:47.257
where we've added
the windows and the ceiling.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.929
On <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>
production had wrapped,

48:52.012 --> 48:54.014
and now we were into visual effects.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.892
And I was the department head.

48:58.769 --> 49:03.398
This matte painting shows
the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> at Cloud City.

49:03.482 --> 49:05.317
In the clear area of glass,

49:07.069 --> 49:11.782
<i>Han Solo comes out and</i>
<i>meets his host at Cloud City.</i>

49:12.491 --> 49:15.911
You've got a lot of guts comin' here,
after what you pulled.

49:21.541 --> 49:24.920
This is another angle
of the <i>Star Destroyer</i> bridge

49:25.003 --> 49:27.255
with the windows and ceiling added.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.091
IMPERIAL CAPTAIN: Take evasive action!

49:33.679 --> 49:36.431
This one's been painted
by Ralph McQuarrie.

49:37.057 --> 49:40.936
One of the real blessings I had

49:41.019 --> 49:44.314
was meeting and getting to know

49:44.982 --> 49:51.071
the great Ralph McQuarrie,
and I don't say that lightly.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.084
<i>There wasn't much room,</i>

50:04.167 --> 50:09.131
<i>so we painted in the little</i>
<i>matte department that we had.</i>

50:13.343 --> 50:17.889
Ralph was a remarkable human being.

50:18.890 --> 50:22.936
<i>He was just patient and he would do</i>
<i>these wonderful paintings.</i>

50:24.646 --> 50:28.525
RALPH: This is Cloud City,
and it was something that evolved.

50:31.695 --> 50:35.741
George said he wants a city
floating in the clouds,

50:35.824 --> 50:39.911
and we looked at <i>Flash Gordon</i> cities,
you know, from the '30s.

50:40.495 --> 50:44.374
<i>And he thought of just something</i>
<i>like this art deco look.</i>

50:44.958 --> 50:46.710
The whole thing just bobbed along

50:46.793 --> 50:49.921
like a cork in the cloud
in some miraculous way.

50:50.422 --> 50:53.341
I came to other forms, you know,

50:53.425 --> 50:58.138
thinking, you know, shapes that were like
pieces of pottery maybe.

50:58.346 --> 51:03.477
<i>And, as I worked in openings and windows,</i>

51:03.602 --> 51:07.981
<i>I think began to look, you know, maybe</i>
<i>like an aircraft carrier or something.</i>

51:08.065 --> 51:11.443
That seemed more fitting,
I don't know why.

51:11.526 --> 51:13.695
Most of these things are rather hazy.

51:13.862 --> 51:17.574
They just feel right, you know, sometimes,
and sometimes they don't.

51:17.657 --> 51:20.494
So you just keep fiddling
until they start to feel right.

51:23.914 --> 51:29.628
ELLENSHAW: <i>I have to admit,</i>
<i>the only thing I was not pleased with</i>

51:30.087 --> 51:34.382
is his clouds looked
like illustrator clouds.

51:38.470 --> 51:42.265
<i>Clouds are probably one of the</i>
<i>hardest thing there is to paint,</i>

51:42.682 --> 51:45.936
<i>and I didn't want</i>
<i>to offend Ralph McQuarrie.</i>

51:46.019 --> 51:48.855
But his first clouds
looked like cauliflowers.

51:48.939 --> 51:52.359
I mean, they just didn't look like clouds.
(LAUGHING) So...

51:52.651 --> 51:57.322
So I said, "You know, Ralph,
we've got so much work to do,

51:57.405 --> 52:01.118
"and tell you what, you do the wide shots

52:01.201 --> 52:05.622
<i>"of the </i>Millennium Falcon
<i>at sunset on the platform.</i>

52:05.705 --> 52:07.165
<i>"You do this, you do that.</i>

52:07.249 --> 52:12.879
"You do the establishing stuff,
and by the way,

52:12.963 --> 52:15.549
"you know, let me do the clouds.

52:16.007 --> 52:18.635
"Why not? I'll do that. You're busy."

52:19.010 --> 52:21.138
I don't know whether
he bought that or not,

52:21.221 --> 52:22.514
but I did the clouds.

52:28.770 --> 52:31.398
And it was a struggle. (LAUGHS)

52:31.481 --> 52:34.860
And sometimes George would say,
"Why don't you let Ralph do the clouds?"

52:35.944 --> 52:37.571
Step aside, kid.

52:37.654 --> 52:39.739
(LAUGHING)

52:39.823 --> 52:40.907
That's not true.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.378
ANNOUNCER: Universe <i>with Walter Cronkite.</i>

52:53.628 --> 52:57.132
CRONKITE: <i>Tonight, the science behind</i>
<i>a fictional universe.</i>

53:00.177 --> 53:01.928
While we were still working on <i>Empire,</i>

53:02.012 --> 53:05.265
we had heard Walter Cronkite
was coming to ILM to talk to George

53:05.348 --> 53:08.935
and shoot some stuff on the stage
and see what was going on.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.979
CRONKITE: <i>He took us on</i>
<i>a tour of his facilities...</i>

53:11.062 --> 53:14.441
RALSTON: <i>They wanted to show the tauntaun</i>
<i>in</i> Empire Strikes Back <i>being shot.</i>

53:15.317 --> 53:18.445
We know no one has a clue
how we create these things.

53:18.737 --> 53:21.448
Well, this is the stop-motion
animation department.

53:21.907 --> 53:25.744
And they're making tauntauns
run across the snow.

53:26.369 --> 53:29.122
RALSTON: <i>And so we decided to do it</i>
<i>in a way you would never do it.</i>

53:29.206 --> 53:31.333
'Cause we knew no one would recognize it.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.126
<i>So it's the two of us in there.</i>

53:33.251 --> 53:35.378
<i>We brought in</i>
<i>what's called the surface gauge,</i>

53:35.462 --> 53:37.923
<i>a bunch of those,</i>
<i>which is what animators use</i>

53:38.506 --> 53:40.926
<i>to mark little things on puppets.</i>

53:41.051 --> 53:45.555
(LAUGHS) What else did we bring in?
Some weird gizmos with rulers on it

53:45.639 --> 53:49.434
and whatever we could grab
filling the scene with this

53:49.935 --> 53:52.520
while he's having a very serious
conversation with George

53:52.604 --> 53:54.648
<i>and talking about</i>
<i>what we're doing out there.</i>

53:54.731 --> 53:57.859
It's a whole art of...
They studied movement.

53:57.943 --> 53:59.027
They shot animals.

53:59.361 --> 54:02.489
And studied them against grids and things
to study the motion.

54:02.781 --> 54:05.951
And then they practiced for months
and months, doing tests.

54:06.576 --> 54:08.286
RALSTON: <i>We're acting like</i>
<i>we're doing stuff.</i>

54:08.370 --> 54:10.914
<i>But we weren't doing anything for real,</i>

54:11.248 --> 54:13.124
<i>and playing it very serious, I think.</i>

54:13.583 --> 54:15.961
But it was fun, you know.
We weren't hurting anybody.

54:16.044 --> 54:18.296
And if anyone actually knew
we were doing it wrong,

54:18.380 --> 54:21.925
it showed they had some idea
of how the work actually was accomplished.

54:22.259 --> 54:26.888
But to do it with Walter Cronkite,
who the (BLEEP) had the nerve? Come on.

54:27.138 --> 54:29.641
What were we thinking? (LAUGHING)

54:30.267 --> 54:33.478
As a science, it's fascinating,
but you're ruining my fantasies.

54:33.561 --> 54:35.188
(BOTH LAUGH)

54:35.647 --> 54:38.900
It sounds like me just trying to be
a jackass, which maybe it was.

54:39.526 --> 54:42.445
But it's also through the course
of all these movies,

54:42.904 --> 54:44.990
it's an interesting lesson to learn about

54:45.073 --> 54:49.369
what an audience perceives
and what you really need to do.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.204
Asteroids.

54:51.746 --> 54:52.831
Oh, no.

54:53.498 --> 54:54.833
Oh.

54:54.916 --> 54:56.167
Chewie, set 271.

54:57.043 --> 54:58.169
What are you doing?

54:59.045 --> 55:01.381
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

55:01.464 --> 55:03.508
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

55:03.591 --> 55:05.343
RALSTON: <i>On</i> Empire Strikes Back,

55:05.510 --> 55:09.597
my version of seeing what you could
get away with were potatoes

55:10.098 --> 55:13.601
in the asteroid field,
and I think it was my comment

55:13.685 --> 55:17.314
<i>on the fact that some of the models</i>
<i>that were built look like potatoes.</i>

55:21.526 --> 55:23.653
My assistant, Sel Eddy, and I,

55:23.737 --> 55:29.034
bought some asteroid-looking potatoes,
stuck them on this rig.

55:29.701 --> 55:34.831
<i>They actually had a pronged pipe</i>
<i>for the Styrofoam asteroids we were using.</i>

55:35.373 --> 55:38.460
You would just shove it on there,
took one of the asteroids off,

55:38.543 --> 55:42.255
put the potatoes on,
shot it against blue screen.

55:43.965 --> 55:46.426
(WHIRRING)

55:52.557 --> 55:55.685
<i>They're flying through, there's shots,</i>
<i>looking out the window and stuff,</i>

55:55.769 --> 55:59.856
<i>and some of them are potatoes,</i>
<i>but you'd never know in a million years.</i>

56:00.023 --> 56:02.317
Not only is it funny,
but it keeps you thinking

56:02.400 --> 56:04.903
about what's the best, fastest,
cheapest way to do this.

56:04.986 --> 56:06.905
You know, it's every producer's dream.

56:06.988 --> 56:09.783
You know, being a successful
visual effects person,

56:10.492 --> 56:13.244
oftentimes is someone
who knows how to cheat

56:13.745 --> 56:16.039
and also to spend
the least amount of money.

56:16.831 --> 56:19.209
<i>There were all sorts of problems</i>
<i>that we came up with</i>

56:19.292 --> 56:21.211
<i>that we had to invent our way out of.</i>

56:21.836 --> 56:24.923
<i>For example, the stars streak</i>
<i>and disappear shot,</i>

56:25.423 --> 56:28.426
that's the one where the stars
(WHOOSHING) going into hyperspace.

56:28.927 --> 56:31.721
<i>And then we have to cut to a shot</i>
<i>of the </i>Millennium Falcon

56:31.805 --> 56:33.848
(WHOOSHES) zipping away from me.

56:34.391 --> 56:37.102
<i>And the problem is,</i>
<i>I can only get the model</i>

56:37.185 --> 56:41.481
to be this big in frame
on a 42-foot track.

56:42.857 --> 56:45.026
<i>I said, "Okay, I got an idea</i>
<i>how to do that."</i>

56:45.110 --> 56:49.656
So I took the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
and I shot a 4x5 Polaroid cocked...

56:49.781 --> 56:51.658
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
-(WHIRRING)

56:52.200 --> 56:56.454
...cut it out and placed it
on a piece of glass and shot it.

56:56.871 --> 56:59.582
Sent it to George and he says,
"Great, I'll cut it in."

56:59.749 --> 57:01.626
(ALARM BUZZING)

57:01.709 --> 57:03.753
<i>We didn't have to do a take two on that.</i>

57:06.339 --> 57:09.676
One second shot and it got the biggest
applause in the movie.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.846
<i>So, I mean,</i>
<i>this is how you learn to cheat.</i>

57:15.181 --> 57:17.267
Dailies will be screened in five minutes.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.602
Dailies will be screened in five minutes.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.022
MAN: There's more?

57:23.106 --> 57:26.901
When we come in, we're sort of like this.

57:26.985 --> 57:29.529
Looking down on it.
Sort of, three-quarter down.

57:29.612 --> 57:33.741
It comes into the frame,
and then we come down like that.

57:34.284 --> 57:37.162
And I would try to get it as small
as possible at the end.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.581
So it really looks like
it's shooting away from us.

57:39.747 --> 57:41.124
RALSTON: <i>The perfect effect,</i>

57:41.249 --> 57:46.421
is conveying the point of the movie,
the emotion of a moment.

57:46.504 --> 57:49.007
<i>It is invisible in some ways.</i>

57:50.467 --> 57:52.469
EDLUND: <i>We have the responsibility</i>

57:52.552 --> 57:56.681
to keep the train of drama
even and flowing.

57:58.016 --> 58:01.102
<i>Enhance it whenever possible,</i>
<i>whenever it's necessary...</i>

58:01.394 --> 58:02.854
(CRACKLING)

58:03.313 --> 58:05.940
...and to reel back when it's necessary.

58:06.274 --> 58:08.735
If you have a visual effects shot
and everyone's going,

58:08.818 --> 58:11.404
"Wow, what a cool effect,"
you have failed.

58:15.867 --> 58:17.785
<i>While we were still working on</i> Empire,

58:17.869 --> 58:20.955
<i>we already knew what was coming up</i>
<i>on the next group of shows.</i>

58:21.539 --> 58:25.668
One was <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>
and one was <i>Dragonslayer.</i>

58:30.965 --> 58:34.969
ILM started becoming more
of a work for hire company

58:35.053 --> 58:39.182
than a George Lucas production company,
because <i>Jedi</i> was right around the corner.

58:39.474 --> 58:42.644
It would take me, again,
at least a year to write the script.

58:43.102 --> 58:46.814
<i>So we had to do something to keep all</i>
<i>those people there and keep them employed.</i>

58:47.232 --> 58:49.484
So that's when we started
taking outside work.

58:49.943 --> 58:52.237
We had this mandate from George,

58:52.320 --> 58:55.406
<i>to not refuse the films</i>
<i>of any of his friends.</i>

58:56.449 --> 58:58.868
<i>If Spielberg came up</i>
<i>and wanted to make a film</i>

58:58.952 --> 59:01.538
by such and such a schedule,
we had to make it work.

59:09.420 --> 59:10.880
RALSTON: <i>I was very excited about it.</i>

59:11.422 --> 59:14.300
We did draw in some very
interesting projects.

59:15.510 --> 59:18.346
<i>And it's also opportunities</i>
<i>for a lot of different work.</i>

59:20.139 --> 59:23.601
We started making films that were like
the golden eggs.

59:25.937 --> 59:28.523
And suddenly everybody
wants to come to ILM.

59:34.195 --> 59:35.446
(GROWLING)

59:35.530 --> 59:40.243
(CHUCKLES) But it was
a very painful growth period.

59:41.035 --> 59:44.747
<i>Each project had a whole new set</i>
<i>of challenges.</i>

59:50.753 --> 59:54.299
