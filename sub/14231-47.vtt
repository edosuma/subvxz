At least I would

Cute car.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.908
Cute? Teddy bears are cute.

03:19.991 --> 03:24.454
That car is the stuff
that dreams are made of,

03:24.537 --> 03:27.999
not that I could afford her
in a million years.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.795
Mommy, you should buy that car for daddy
and make him feel better.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.964
I wish I could, honey.
He'd love it, wouldn't he?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.966
She's a beaut, all righty.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.260
On a scale of one to seven,
three bein' highest,

03:39.344 --> 03:41.179
I'd give her a 12.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.932
You can say that again, Goof.

Uh, say what again?

winning the kind of good publicity

that for the last eight years.

Oh, yeah, right.

Honey, don't feed poopsie
your sugar shock-o cereal.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.073
But they're enriched
with one essential vitamin,

04:42.157 --> 04:43.658
and half a nutrient,

04:43.742 --> 04:46.661
and it is good for her, too, Mommy.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.039
Pistol, the last time puppy had sugar,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.833
we had to scrape her off
the ceiling with a spatula.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.626
Mommy, you already have one job,

04:53.710 --> 04:55.712
and you say me and P.J.
are a full-time job,

05:10.018 --> 05:11.770
I wish I could think of something.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.440
I know. Buy me a pony,
and I'll let you sell rides,

05:15.523 --> 05:17.734
or dress daddy up like a high-diving pig,

05:17.817 --> 05:20.528
or, I know, you can sell P.J.!

dangerous-lookin' character

without my glasses.

for cleaner, rags,

06:33.893 --> 06:34.978
and cute outfits,

06:35.061 --> 06:38.314
we made $2.78.

Not bad for the first day.

Oh, but it's saturday, love puddle.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.167
Our one and only day together,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.418
with you bringin' me snacks

06:58.501 --> 07:01.755
while I watch 16 hours of football.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.507
No, sorry, sugar pop, got work to do.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.509
Work? What work?

07:06.593 --> 07:10.972
Washing windows. Yesterday we earned
two whole dollars and 78 cents.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.390
[Pete laughs]

07:12.474 --> 07:15.018
That's enough to buy two whole goldfish

07:15.101 --> 07:16.770
or half a bottom feeder.

to work this thing.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.883
With all this free time,

07:46.966 --> 07:49.761
guess I could practice my award speech.

07:49.844 --> 07:54.516
First of all, I'd like to thank someone
near and dear to our hearts--

07:54.599 --> 07:57.102
A man whose never-say-die attitude

07:57.185 --> 07:59.771
could be an inspiration to us all,

07:59.854 --> 08:02.691
someone whose hard work and dedication

08:02.774 --> 08:05.151
made this award possible...

08:05.235 --> 08:07.612
Me. There they are.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.281
I'll make 'em feel guilt
like they never felt.

I'll say I contracted acute lonely-itis

08:12.951 --> 08:15.995
brought on by chronic neglect.

Hurry up and shake a leg
while you're at it.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.500
It's almost on.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.127
Come on, Pistol, we can't miss it.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.546
You think we'll all be stars
and get residual payments?

08:24.629 --> 08:27.757
Well, pleased as petunias to see you, too.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.926
Hurry, Dad! It's mom's commercial.

Oh, and on your way back,
could you stop by the cleaners

11:05.165 --> 11:06.666
[Pete yells]

11:06.875 --> 11:10.170
Whoa!

11:10.253 --> 11:13.757
...And 200 squeegee power
window scrubbers.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.594
It's high-concept, user-friendly,
top of the line.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.763
Get the little woman
the manager's special.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.974
[chuckles] Couldn't pay the junkyard
to take it off our hands.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.144
You take this baby and walk away
with the bee prize.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.229
[both chuckle]

11:29.606 --> 11:31.691
[man] I'm pleased as pickled peanuts

11:31.775 --> 11:34.069
to announce Peg's appointment

11:34.152 --> 11:36.905
as official City Hall window washer.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.990
-[applause]
-[flash bulb pops]

11:39.074 --> 11:41.951
So how does it feel to be
the man behind the woman

11:42.035 --> 11:45.246
-behind the man?
-Not so fast.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.667
As a semi-law abidin'
somewhat tax payin' citizen,

11:48.750 --> 11:52.545
I happen to know you gotta
take bids on this job.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.549
Well, yeah, I believe you're right.

11:56.633 --> 12:00.220
And I say I could do your windows
better, quicker, cheaper.

12:00.303 --> 12:04.182
Well, I was hoping you wouldn't
lose your suspenders over this, Peter,

12:04.265 --> 12:07.769
but if you want a fight, you got one.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.152
And where's that scaffolding
you promised me?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.863
Right over here, dear.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.701
[Peg] What is that?

12:22.784 --> 12:24.828
[Pete] This is the finest
window washing condiment

12:24.911 --> 12:26.204

12:26.287 --> 12:28.957
Tried and true and tested over the ages.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.875
Why, it was a machine just like this

12:30.959 --> 12:33.503
that washed the windows on the pyramids.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.964
I don't know what no-good you're up to,

12:36.047 --> 12:39.926
but I'm gonna win that job no matter what.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.557
Three feet up,

12:45.640 --> 12:47.559
I-- I can handle this.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.811
Four feet, no sweat.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.731
Five, it's not so bad

12:52.814 --> 12:54.774
'cept I'm gettin' a nosebleed

12:54.858 --> 12:57.235
and I'm kind of startin' to black out.

12:59.988 --> 13:04.909
Whew! I think this is gonna take
some creative thinkin'.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.620
[panting, straining]

13:13.376 --> 13:18.465
[panting] When this is over,
Pete's gonna eat broccoli for a year.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.592
Now, look, goofster,

13:20.675 --> 13:23.553
Peg's in trouble, serious trouble.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.347
Could lose the award.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.808
Gawrsh! We gotta do somethin'
to help her out.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.977
-Good thinkin'.
-Whoa!

13:31.436 --> 13:33.313
You start on this side of the buildin',

13:33.396 --> 13:35.482
and maybe she'll have a fightin' chance.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.485
Now, you got your automatic scrubbers,
easy-listening CD,

13:38.568 --> 13:40.570
ready-made ballast and eardrum swabber.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.741
All's you gotta do is just sit back
and clean those windows.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.118
[laughing]

13:47.202 --> 13:48.828
Don't worry about a thing.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.665
Uh, lemme see now, listen to the windows,
blast the CD,

13:52.749 --> 13:55.543
swab the scrubber, and eat a drummette.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.922
[male voice on the CD player]
Ah, the SP 1500--

13:59.005 --> 14:02.717
Leisurely adrift
on the zephyrs of solitude,

14:02.801 --> 14:05.470
but to keep that heavenly vessel stable,

14:05.553 --> 14:09.182
one must master
the intricacies of ballast.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.851
Give a gentle twist.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.854
Whaa-ha-ha-hooey!

14:14.938 --> 14:17.524
-[cooing]
-Shoo! Shoo!

14:17.607 --> 14:19.943
Well, hey, that tickles. [laughing]

14:20.026 --> 14:21.945
Hey, hey!

14:22.028 --> 14:25.281
Ah-choo!

14:25.365 --> 14:28.702
[man clears throat]
Can we get back to business?

14:28.785 --> 14:29.911
Sorry.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.163
[male voice on the CD player]
Let's try that again.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.165
Gently turn the regulator.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.792
Gently.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.587
The window washer is the high-wire artist

14:39.671 --> 14:41.423
of the industrial world,

14:41.506 --> 14:43.008
But remember,

14:43.091 --> 14:46.177
safety is the first order of the day.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.556
The harness adds
an extra cushion of comfort

14:49.639 --> 14:53.018
for those courageous craftsmen.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.936
Whaa-ha-ha-hoo!

14:55.061 --> 14:58.064
You know, I could get
seriously hurt doin' this.

15:01.568 --> 15:05.697
Good thing I ate a light
breakfast. Ah-hyuck!

Let's continue, shall we?

15:14.080 --> 15:17.751
Don't stop on my account.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.629
[male voice on the CD player] Ah,
the indispensable dispenser pump,

15:21.713 --> 15:25.175
where would the artist
of the air be without it?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.634
Engage the mechanism

15:26.718 --> 15:29.387
and observe the economy of form,

15:29.471 --> 15:31.598

15:31.681 --> 15:33.600
[sputtering]

15:33.683 --> 15:37.062
[male voice on the CD player]
And what true craftsman can't appreciate

15:37.145 --> 15:40.607
the computer-automated squeegee?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.067
Gawrsh.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.205
Cease and desist, pegums,

15:55.288 --> 15:58.708
or be harangued with meringue.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.964
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

16:05.090 --> 16:08.426
Prepare to be eclaired.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.388
Peter!

16:11.554 --> 16:13.765
When there's a fly in the ointment,

16:13.890 --> 16:17.018
keep the fly away from the windows.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.479
Pete! What do you think you're doing?

16:19.562 --> 16:21.898
If you only knew the real reason
I was working this hard...

16:21.981 --> 16:25.235
why do you have to always compete with me
all the time? I know what I'm doing.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.237
I can wash those windows
better than you can!

16:27.320 --> 16:28.488
You've never cleaned a thing in your life!

16:28.571 --> 16:30.240
Pete, what are you doing over there?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.991
What's that, dear?

16:32.075 --> 16:33.410
Can't hear ya,

16:33.493 --> 16:36.621
too many air molecules.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.919
-[Peg] Peter!
-Uh-oh.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.054
[Peg] Peter!

16:53.138 --> 16:57.350
[Pete] Sweet petunia, come back!

17:06.818 --> 17:09.696
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'll save ya!

17:09.821 --> 17:11.781
Aah!

Just don't look down.

into account the effects of gravity.
