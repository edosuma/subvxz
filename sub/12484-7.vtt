00:12.210 --> 00:14.170
Do you mind?

00:14.210 --> 00:16.390
Look, I'm trying to work here.

00:16.420 --> 00:19.390
I found this sucker to pay me
to do his homework for him.

00:19.430 --> 00:21.360
You're coloring in a dinosaur.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.240
Yeah. He's in kindergarten.

00:28.350 --> 00:31.180
Cameron, you're not even
staying within the lines!

00:31.220 --> 00:33.120
You get what you pay for.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.460
Hey, daddy.
You're home early. Hey!

00:37.490 --> 00:42.030
Yeah. I was supposed to interrogate
this suspect in this strangler case,

00:42.060 --> 00:44.970
But when I went to the
bathroom, he escaped.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
So now I get to watch my game shows!

00:48.340 --> 00:50.270
So, what's that?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.200
Oh! I have
a surprise for you.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.440
You know how you've been
wanting one of those.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.180
Fancy free village designer book bags?

00:56.210 --> 00:57.280
You got me one?

00:58.220 --> 00:59.980
Nope!

01:02.120 --> 01:04.060
I got you something better.
Okay.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.200
Yup. Talk to me.

01:13.130 --> 01:15.070
I'm sorry, but how is this better?

01:15.100 --> 01:16.300
Because it was free!

01:18.240 --> 01:20.310
I got it from the evidence
locker at the police station.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.340
Is this blood?

01:24.450 --> 01:26.050
Of course not!

01:26.080 --> 01:28.280
I wouldn't give you a murder bag.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.050
That's an armed robbery bag.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.120
That stain's from an exploding dye pack.

01:34.150 --> 01:37.320
You should see the guy's face.

01:37.360 --> 01:42.000
Okay, so you can just take stuff
from the evidence locker?

01:42.030 --> 01:45.340
That's one of the perks of the job.

01:45.370 --> 01:50.980
Like parking in a red zone
or making fun of firemen.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.280
They think they are so great.

01:52.310 --> 01:55.050
The water does all the work!

01:57.150 --> 01:59.190
Anyway, you could say thank you.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.390
I spent hours combing through a lot
of creepy stuff to find you that.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.360
Is this how you got mom's wedding ring?

02:06.400 --> 02:08.160
Don't change the subject.

02:10.199 --> 02:13.000
Dad, can I please have a free village bag?

02:13.040 --> 02:14.970
I mean, every girl at school has one.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.040
I'll even chip in a little.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.310
Absolutely not.

02:19.380 --> 02:21.240
No child of mine is going to walk around.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.310
With some overpriced status symbol.

02:23.350 --> 02:26.020
Huh! "Free village."

02:26.050 --> 02:29.050
They should call it
"$300 village!"

02:29.090 --> 02:30.320
See how many they sell then!

02:33.990 --> 02:35.260
Oh, okay, daddy.

02:35.290 --> 02:37.160
I'll go write you a thank you note.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.430
Oh, look, I'll do it on the back of this.

02:39.470 --> 02:43.270
"give me all your money
and no one gets hurt."

02:45.340 --> 02:47.170
That's where that went.

02:47.210 --> 02:50.340
We really could have used that in court.

02:53.210 --> 02:57.050
How come you got chyna
a present and not me?

02:57.090 --> 02:59.020
You know how girls are.

02:59.050 --> 03:00.390
They're obsessed with fitting in.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.360
But see, the great thing
about you, Cameron,

03:02.390 --> 03:05.290
Is that no matter what you
do, you'll never fit in.

Whoo!

04:06.360 --> 04:09.330
Hey, chyna.
Oh, I love that.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.160
Did the bag-lady wake up when you
took it out from under her head?

04:15.200 --> 04:18.240
Wait a minute, you have
two free village bags?

04:18.269 --> 04:21.140
Yeah. This one
is for my books.

04:21.170 --> 04:24.140
And this one is for my makeup.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.980
Hey, look what's at the
bottom of my pudding cup!

04:30.020 --> 04:34.190
Fletcher, if it's another rat
part, I do not want to see it.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.990
No, it says,
"10 pudding points."

04:38.020 --> 04:40.030
Hey, I think I remember
seeing something about that.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.430
On the label a few weeks ago.
What'd it say?

04:42.460 --> 04:45.370
"hey kids! Earn cash awards
and pudding-tastic prizes!

04:45.400 --> 04:48.140
"join the healthy time pudding
club by visiting our Web site!

04:48.170 --> 04:50.270
"some restrictions may apply.
Void where prohibited by law.

04:50.310 --> 04:52.340
"employees of healthy time
pudding are ineligible.

04:52.370 --> 04:56.440
"warning. Healthy time pudding may cause
obesity, cavities and premature death."

05:00.980 --> 05:02.250
Well, it says here on their Web site.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.420
That when you get 1,000 points,

05:03.450 --> 05:07.120
You can redeem them for a $10 cash card.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.060
Okay. So, to buy
a free nation bag,

05:09.090 --> 05:11.390
All you need to do
is eat 3,000 pudding cups.

05:11.430 --> 05:14.100
Well, after that, I won't need a bag.

05:14.130 --> 05:17.000
I can just carry my books
in my rolls of fat.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.010
Guys, look.
Everyone's throwing away their cups.

05:25.110 --> 05:26.410
If we collect them all from the trash,

05:26.440 --> 05:28.210
We'll rack up points like crazy.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.050
That's a great idea!

05:30.080 --> 05:33.020
Okay. So, Fletcher, dive into the
trash and get the pudding cups.

05:33.050 --> 05:34.280
Come on.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.290
Why me?

05:36.320 --> 05:38.150
Because I don't want to.
And neither do I.

05:38.190 --> 05:40.260
Oh. Well, as long
as it's fair.

05:40.290 --> 05:41.390
Yeah.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.070
Oh, I love your bag, hayley!

05:54.070 --> 05:57.270
Oh, nice bag, anabella!

05:57.310 --> 06:01.140
Oh! Hey, wacky,
look, we're twins.

06:03.380 --> 06:06.950
Oh, guys, check out
my free village book bag!

06:06.980 --> 06:08.220
Is it awesome or what?

06:08.250 --> 06:10.220
It works for a stroll in the park...

06:13.460 --> 06:15.020
A night on the town...

06:18.290 --> 06:20.230
Or hiding from paparazzi.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.360
Oh, stop!

06:23.270 --> 06:24.430
Stop taking pictures!

06:24.470 --> 06:28.200
I just want a normal life!

06:28.240 --> 06:33.210
It's all right.
But can you keep your lunch in its belly?

06:35.240 --> 06:38.310
So if it's a book bag,
why aren't your books in it?

06:38.350 --> 06:41.220
Oh. Because most of the
room in my new new bag.

06:41.250 --> 06:46.150
Is being taken up by the old
new bag that my dad gave me.

06:46.190 --> 06:48.990
My dad would go nuts if he
knew I got this new new bag.

06:49.020 --> 06:50.360
So I leave the house using the old new bag.

06:50.390 --> 06:52.260
And hide the new new bag inside it.

06:52.290 --> 06:55.030
Then, when I'm on the bus, I take the
new new bag out of the old new bag,

06:55.060 --> 06:57.070
And hide the old new bag
inside the new new bag.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.270
Then, I take the old new bag
out of the new new bag.

06:59.300 --> 07:03.240
And hide the new new bag
back inside the old new bag.

07:04.370 --> 07:06.370
Seems kind of complicated to me.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.110
How so?

07:13.350 --> 07:16.220
So, Cameron, how's the
kindergarten homework going?

07:16.250 --> 07:20.990
Not good. I could only find seven of
the 10 things wrong with this picture.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.260
Ooh, eight!
Cows don't have tails.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.400
You know, you really should
give that kid a discount.

07:29.370 --> 07:32.070
Hey, Cameron.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.970
What's that?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.500
Well, I felt bad about
not getting you anything.

07:35.540 --> 07:40.110
From the evidence locker, so I
brought you a portable music player.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.310
Really?
Yeah.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.350
Is this a car stereo?

07:50.250 --> 07:52.260
You're welcome.

07:54.420 --> 07:57.490
But doesn't it need speakers?
And a car?

07:59.200 --> 08:03.130
You know, kids today.
Nothing's ever enough for you.

08:03.170 --> 08:06.070
You know what I had to listen to
music with when I was your age?

08:06.100 --> 08:08.000
Ears and a window!

08:08.040 --> 08:09.270
Whatever the neighbors had on,

08:09.310 --> 08:11.270
That's what I listened to.

08:11.310 --> 08:14.280
You know what I got?
Arms and a window.

08:14.310 --> 08:16.280
I'm gonna go throw this out of it.

08:16.310 --> 08:18.950
Give me this.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.380
So, you're not going to use your gift?

08:20.420 --> 08:22.980
At least chyna uses hers!

08:24.390 --> 08:26.020
What is this?

08:26.060 --> 08:28.060
Why does chyna have a new new bag.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.160
Stuffed inside her old new bag?

08:34.360 --> 08:36.260
Hey, daddy.
Hey, sweetie.

08:38.030 --> 08:42.400
How was your day?
Anything... New?

08:44.270 --> 08:47.140
Well, you know, there were some
more budget cuts at school,

08:47.170 --> 08:50.340
So they combined french class with art.

08:50.380 --> 08:53.110
It's now called fart.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.220
So how are you enjoying your new bag?

09:01.150 --> 09:03.050
My new bag?
Mmm-hmm.

09:03.090 --> 09:05.290
Oh, you mean the one that you gave me.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.190
Yeah. Turns out
that I love it.

09:07.990 --> 09:10.000
So much.

09:11.130 --> 09:14.030
So much that I wish I were a bag.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.170
And that bags could get married,

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
Because I would marry it.

09:18.070 --> 09:20.410
But sadly, society's not ready for that.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.980
Officer 3-9?
This is Detective parks.

09:28.210 --> 09:30.110
Hold on, Darryl.

09:32.150 --> 09:34.990
That'll teach you to
double-park, dirtbag!

09:38.420 --> 09:41.160
Hey, what's up?

09:41.190 --> 09:42.960
I'm probably overreacting,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.030
But I'm worried my daughter
might be shoplifting.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.200
I'm gonna need you to go undercover.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.240
Hi, I'm the new kid.
Where do I sit?

10:09.040 --> 10:11.070
Hey, who's the new kid?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.110
I don't know.

10:13.590 --> 10:14.840
Is that a sippy cup?

10:18.020 --> 10:21.220
Hi, I'm chyna, and this
is olive and Fletcher.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.290
I'm Charlie.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.120
Charlie... Brown.

10:26.230 --> 10:28.060
That's an unusual name.

10:28.090 --> 10:31.160
Look who's talking, Fletcher.

10:33.070 --> 10:34.300
Good thing he doesn't
know your middle name.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.070
It's pumpernickel!

10:38.210 --> 10:42.040
So, Charlie brown, what's your gift?

10:42.080 --> 10:44.240
I didn't know I was
supposed to bring a gift.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.080
Will you take cash?
Yes.

10:47.110 --> 10:49.180
No, I meant your talent.

10:49.210 --> 10:52.280
Everybody in the a.N.T.
Program has a special talent.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.050
Yeah.
Chyna's is music, mine is art,

10:55.090 --> 10:57.120
And olive's is answering
questions nobody's asking.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.260
I'm really good at it!

11:01.930 --> 11:03.200
My talent is...

11:26.960 --> 11:29.060
Dancing.

11:29.090 --> 11:31.160
Ooh, cool!
Can I see?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.230
See what?
See you dance.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.300
Oh, right.

11:37.270 --> 11:38.330
Sure.

11:46.170 --> 11:48.140
This is good,
isn't it? Yeah.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.980
Shake a little out.
Shake a little out.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.910
And then go old-school.
Yeah! Oh, you like that?

11:52.950 --> 11:55.850
Yeah! Oh, big finish!

11:59.150 --> 12:02.020
Wow. You are good.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.260
Wake up, Cameron!

12:16.000 --> 12:19.010
I wasn't sleeping.
Just doing homework.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.240
Hey, I've got a surprise for you.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.210
A new bike!

12:28.180 --> 12:30.020
Where are the tires?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.920
By now?
Probably in Tijuana.

12:33.950 --> 12:35.290
You know what,

12:35.320 --> 12:39.030
Next time why don't you give me a
card saying, "I don't love you"?

12:39.930 --> 12:41.160
They make those?

12:43.300 --> 12:45.070
You know what, fine.

12:45.100 --> 12:48.940
If you want something, how about
you go down to the precinct,

12:48.970 --> 12:51.310
Ask for bernice to let you
in the evidence locker.

12:51.340 --> 12:53.180
And you can pick out something yourself.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.210
Because I'm done trying to please you.

12:56.880 --> 12:57.950
I'll go tomorrow.

12:57.980 --> 13:00.080
I have all this homework to finish.

13:01.850 --> 13:04.890
This Turkey isn't gonna draw itself.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.130
I feel so sick.
Pass me another one.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.100
Hey, what are you guys up to?

13:17.130 --> 13:20.870
We're just working on something
we call operation sticky fingers.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.000
You see, we figured out a way to...

13:26.210 --> 13:29.040
What he meant is.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.250
We're having a pudding eating contest.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.010
Oh! Do you want
to go for the record?

13:33.050 --> 13:35.050
Oh, I can't. My doctor
says my cholesterol...

13:35.080 --> 13:40.120
I mean, mommy says I have
to cut down on sweets.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.960
Excuse me.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.320
That's probably mommy now.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.860
Hi, mommy.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.130
Fletcher, don't tell anyone
else about the pudding points.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.270
We want all that stuff for ourselves.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.240
Can't we tell Charlie brown?

13:57.270 --> 14:00.810
I mean, he's the first cool ant ever.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.140
He's not afraid to use a sippy cup,

14:02.180 --> 14:04.840
He busts out those awesome dance moves,

14:04.880 --> 14:08.180
And I think he wears aftershave.

14:08.220 --> 14:10.050
Well, I don't trust him.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.920
You know, I think he's lying about his age.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.190
Yeah, there's no way he's 11.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.920
He's eight, tops.

14:19.260 --> 14:21.230
Hey, there's Charlie brown.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.160
Aww, and that must be his mom,

14:23.200 --> 14:24.900
The one who won't let him eat sweets.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.170
Well, she's giving him some sugar now.

14:32.010 --> 14:33.110
I gotta get back to work.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.840
See you at home, babe.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.080
Officer 3-9 here.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.850
He's a cop!

14:38.880 --> 14:40.910
I knew it! I knew
he wasn't an ant!

14:40.950 --> 14:43.880
Hey, Darryl.
Is he talking to my dad?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.520
Tell me what's going on.

14:45.550 --> 14:49.960
<i>They've started something</i> <i>called
"operation</i> <i>sticky fingers."</i>

14:49.990 --> 14:53.930
I'm working on infiltrating their
little shoplifting operation.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.030
My dad thinks I'm shoplifting?

14:56.060 --> 14:58.900
I can't believe he doesn't trust me!

14:58.930 --> 15:00.970
I feel so betrayed.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.170
I can't believe Charlie
brown would lie to us.

15:04.210 --> 15:08.010
You think you know someone
after half a week of school.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.210
You know what?

15:11.250 --> 15:13.120
We're going to teach him a lesson.

15:13.150 --> 15:14.150
Him and my father.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.160
He's coming. He's coming.
Everybody act suspicious.

15:19.190 --> 15:20.860
Okay.
Go, go, go.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.930
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.170
Oh, shoot.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.070
He is on to our crime syndicate.

15:34.170 --> 15:36.840
This could be bad news, yous guys.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.840
We can't risk having a snitch around.

15:39.140 --> 15:40.280
I says we...

15:43.080 --> 15:44.280
Tickle his neck?

15:46.850 --> 15:47.920
Wait.

15:47.950 --> 15:50.250
He could be valuable to us.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.060
So, here's the deal.

15:54.090 --> 15:57.060
Up until now we have only been shoplifting,

15:57.100 --> 15:59.100
But now we're going for the big score.

15:59.130 --> 16:03.230
Yeah, we're going to break
into a house and clean it out.

16:03.270 --> 16:05.870
Not literally.
We're not going to housekeep.

16:07.910 --> 16:09.910
We're going to steal stuff.

16:09.940 --> 16:11.910
You want in?
Totally.

16:11.940 --> 16:13.140
Sign me up.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.950
Good.

16:14.980 --> 16:17.110
'cause we need someone to sneak
in through the doggy door,

16:17.150 --> 16:18.920
And you're the only one that can fit.

16:18.950 --> 16:21.990
And it's all going down tonight.

16:22.020 --> 16:24.890
By this time tomorrow, we'll be rich.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.830
Yeah. You'll end up
with plenty of bread.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.000
Clams. Lettuce.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.030
Cheddar.

16:32.070 --> 16:35.200
That is, if you choose to spend
your cut at the grocery store.

16:42.910 --> 16:46.010
So, 3-9, what's going
on at that school?

16:46.050 --> 16:48.580
Well, I got a b+ on my history quiz.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.650
And I totally
deserved an a-.

16:50.690 --> 16:53.890
3-9, what's
chyna up to?

16:53.920 --> 16:55.890
Well, I joined their little crime ring,

16:55.920 --> 16:57.990
And they're planning on robbing a house.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.830
No. That can't be right.

16:59.860 --> 17:01.800
There's no way my little
girl is robbing a house.

17:01.830 --> 17:03.930
I'm telling you, they told me themselves.

17:03.970 --> 17:06.630
They even threatened to tickle my neck.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.000
How'd they know I'm ticklish?

17:08.040 --> 17:10.800
These guys really do their homework.

17:11.910 --> 17:13.770
What house?

17:13.810 --> 17:15.710
Whose house are they robbing?

17:15.740 --> 17:17.839
Well, they won't tell me yet
because I'm the new guy.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.650
But I'll call you when I'm in the house.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.579
And you can come and see for yourself.

17:21.609 --> 17:23.880
Help!

17:23.920 --> 17:26.650
Hey, check it out.
It's a dude with a purse!

17:27.890 --> 17:28.890
Wow.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.960
Sorry I'm late.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.740
Fletcher, do you understand
the term "cat burglar"?

17:40.770 --> 17:44.840
Obviously.
Seems I'm the only one who does.

17:48.010 --> 17:50.780
Okay, Charlie brown,

17:50.810 --> 17:51.980
Go in through the doggy door,

17:52.020 --> 17:54.990
Make sure the coast is
clear, then let us in.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.620
Will do.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.730
Now are you sure he doesn't
know this is your house?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.560
How could he possibly know?

18:06.600 --> 18:10.530
Your last name is on the
mailbox and the doormat.

18:10.570 --> 18:13.570
Wow. He's a really
bad Detective.

18:18.610 --> 18:19.680
Hello!

18:19.710 --> 18:22.010
It's me.
I'm in the house.

18:22.050 --> 18:23.920
You actually broke into a house?

18:23.950 --> 18:25.820
Yeah, yeah, I told you.

18:25.850 --> 18:29.020
But I'm not really sure why
chyna picked this place.

18:29.050 --> 18:32.960
There's nothing in here worth stealing.
It's all junk.

18:32.990 --> 18:35.960
Ugly, worthless junk.

18:36.890 --> 18:38.600
Do you have an address?

18:38.630 --> 18:40.600
Yeah, I saw it
on the way in. It's...

18:42.630 --> 18:44.600
I think there's someone in the house.

18:45.740 --> 18:47.640
Wait, I think there's someone in the house.

18:49.810 --> 18:51.040
I think they're downstairs.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.940
I think they're coming downstairs.

18:54.650 --> 18:56.010
I'll call you back.

19:35.820 --> 19:37.790
Dad, are you okay?

19:37.820 --> 19:40.890
No! I just got tasered
in the kneecap!

19:40.920 --> 19:43.830
You are in big trouble.
Big trouble.

19:43.860 --> 19:47.760
Um... I think I saw a mouse.
Gotta go.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.000
Oh, no, my Cat got out!

19:53.040 --> 19:56.640
Chyna, what are you doing
breaking into your own house?

19:56.670 --> 19:57.970
I'm teaching you a lesson.

19:58.010 --> 19:59.810
How could you think I would steal?

19:59.840 --> 20:01.680
You know me better than that.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.980
Well, then how do you
explain the new new bag.

20:04.010 --> 20:06.880
You were hiding in your old new bag?

20:06.910 --> 20:08.850
I bought it with gift cards I got.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.650
By collecting pudding cups from
the garbage cans at school.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.920
Would you please keep it down?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.860
We're trying to have a conversation.

20:17.630 --> 20:19.930
So you're telling me you
rummaged through the trash.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.870
To get a $300 designer bag for free?

20:23.870 --> 20:24.930
Yeah.

20:24.970 --> 20:27.000
That's my girl!

20:27.040 --> 20:29.640
I knew you'd never steal.

20:30.970 --> 20:33.010
But you did lie to me
about getting that bag.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.640
Look, I know I shouldn't have lied,

20:35.680 --> 20:37.810
But I'm the only one who doesn't have one.

20:37.850 --> 20:40.820
I feel like I stick out enough as it is.

20:42.090 --> 20:45.090
Look, you stick out because you're special.

20:45.890 --> 20:47.760
And beautiful.

20:47.790 --> 20:49.690
Just like me.

20:50.990 --> 20:54.830
Look, I know fitting in
in High School is tough.

20:54.870 --> 20:57.670
Especially when you're so much
younger than anybody else.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.740
I know, but I'm gonna
help you get through it.

21:01.770 --> 21:04.040
But we need to communicate.

21:04.070 --> 21:08.010
And always be honest with each other, okay?

21:08.050 --> 21:10.750
Okay. I'll promise
to be honest.

21:10.780 --> 21:13.850
If you promise not to send
any more cops to spy on me.

21:13.890 --> 21:17.020
What? I never sent
anyone to spy on you.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.830
What are you talking about?
He's right there.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.770
I've never seen that man in my life!

21:28.800 --> 21:30.630
He must be a burglar!

21:30.670 --> 21:33.040
Come on, dad.
What happened to always being honest?

21:33.070 --> 21:36.970
Seriously.
If I knew him, would I do this?

21:44.980 --> 21:46.950
Hey, bro, it's Cameron.

21:46.980 --> 21:48.990
Look, I just got all this great
stuff from the evidence locker.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.850
At my dad's precinct.

21:50.890 --> 21:55.060
A crowbar, a flashlight
and a cool ski mask.

21:57.690 --> 22:00.860
Oh, snap, I forgot my keys.
Hold on a second.

22:04.770 --> 22:07.700
Hey, you hear that?
Someone's trying to break in.

22:07.740 --> 22:10.620
They're going to be disappointed
when they see this junk.

22:10.820 --> 22:12.020
