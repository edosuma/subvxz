I mean, if he is a "he."

25:15.615 --> 25:17.014
I've never actually seen him.

25:17.016 --> 25:20.117
In fact, no one has.
Not for many years.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.054
So this is where hope

We'll find him, Regina.
It's not like he just vanished.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.995
Blue, do you have any idea
why he might've disappeared?

25:30.997 --> 25:32.530
Sadly, no.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.899
But there are whispers
that he left hidden clues

25:34.901 --> 25:36.166
in some of his works.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.602

We can make it through it.

Well, that's easier said
than done.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.907
It doesn't seem to know which
one of us to go after first.

I thought the spell was only
supposed to release the fairies.

28:01.370 --> 28:02.710
Well, maybe it is
some kind of fairy.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.104
Why don't we just put it
back in the hat

28:04.105 --> 28:05.794
and figure out the rest later?
Because we can't.

28:05.795 --> 28:07.850
Once something's freed,
it can never be retrapped.

28:07.860 --> 28:10.285
Great. So our best defense
against magical beasts

28:10.289 --> 28:12.222
follows the same rules
as chicken pox?

28:12.224 --> 28:14.858
Surely the Savior and Evil Queen
can defeat a simple hell beast.

We only stunned it.

And a blast like that

All you have to do is press

I know a phone works.

I just don't know if I can trust
the man whose phone it is.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.491
And why is that?

29:20.493 --> 29:23.026
I mean, you have my phone,
my entire plan.

29:23.028 --> 29:26.363
And tonight, if you decide
not to come back for me

29:26.365 --> 29:28.198
and stay in Storybrooke
and abandon me,

29:28.200 --> 29:30.768
I couldn't blame you.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.870
That's why this time
is different,

29:32.872 --> 29:35.022
because this time,

29:35.023 --> 29:37.173
my entire salvation depends
not on you trusting me,

29:37.176 --> 29:39.343
but on me trusting you.

29:40.913 --> 29:44.481
Now... Are we in this together?

29:48.420 --> 29:50.954
I guess you'll find out tonight,

Rumple found us in New York,

Told us a tearful tale about how
he was living in a quaint town

30:34.675 --> 30:36.842
until he ruined everything.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.002
But he said it was

where villains could find
redemption.

and we've changed, too.

Mom, this doesn't sound
like you.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.658
You always believe the best
in everyone.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.660
I'm also a realist.
Emma, she's right.

36:36.662 --> 36:39.563
Things were just starting to get
back to normal in Storybrooke.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.365
- You, too? - Look, we don't know
anything about these two.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.334
They could be looking
for redemption,

36:44.336 --> 36:47.904
but they also could be as evil
as Mr. Gold or Zelena or worse.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.240
That could be,
but they just helped us,

36:50.242 --> 36:51.575
and we made a deal.

36:51.577 --> 36:54.244
Doesn't matter. It's a bad idea.
They're villains.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.947
You're right. They are.
They're horrible...

36:56.949 --> 37:00.684
But not as horrible
as I was once.

37:00.686 --> 37:04.888
And if I deserve
a second chance, so do they.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.357
How can I sit here,
looking for my happiness,

37:07.359 --> 37:10.327
and deny two others
a chance at theirs?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.896
I'm with Regina.
We let them in.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.837
[ sighs deeply ]

37:22.841 --> 37:24.741
<i>[ whoosh ]</i>

37:34.686 --> 37:36.886
[ car door opens ]

37:41.793 --> 37:43.693
<i>[ whoosh ]</i>

37:47.833 --> 37:49.899
[ engine starts ]

37:51.036 --> 37:53.603
Welcome to Storybrooke.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.372
Thank you, Regina.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.573
You won't regret it.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.808
I better not.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.011
Hmm.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.343
<i>[ whoosh ]</i>

38:33.345 --> 38:34.744
[ clatter ]

38:51.863 --> 38:54.464
We're back, darling.

38:54.466 --> 38:57.534
You didn't think we abandoned
you, did you, Dark One?

38:57.536 --> 39:00.870
Of course not.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.739
We're a team.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.876
<i>[ whoosh ]</i>

39:06.878 --> 39:08.912
Nice duds.
Now what do we do?

39:08.914 --> 39:11.648
Now we begin our task.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.085
It's simple, really.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.953
Continue to repent
your wicked ways.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.956
Make friends.
Build relationships.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.558
And just what will you be doing?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.893
I'll continue my work
behind the scenes, of course.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.096
Sounds like we're doing
<i>everything,</i> again.

39:27.599 --> 39:31.000
How do you think we got in here?

39:31.002 --> 39:34.404
And how do you think
that chernabog was released?

39:34.406 --> 39:36.973
It was me.

39:36.975 --> 39:41.044
I'm the Oxford professor who
translated the spell for Belle,

39:41.046 --> 39:43.046
the spell that released
the fairies

39:43.048 --> 39:45.815
and also happened to unleash
that monstrosity.

39:45.817 --> 39:49.419
So I ask you consider
what I was able to do

39:49.421 --> 39:50.954
on the outside,

39:50.956 --> 39:53.757
at my lowest point,
without magic.

39:53.759 --> 39:57.627
And then consider
what I'm able to do in here.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.397
So maybe we should stop
bickering and get on with it.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.866
So our team is one member short.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.868
It's time to reunite the band.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.404
Y-you don't mean...

40:07.406 --> 40:08.705
Maleficent.

40:08.707 --> 40:09.806
But she's dead.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.841
Not entirely.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.777
Well, just what does that mean?

40:13.779 --> 40:15.745
It means we have our work
cut out,

40:15.747 --> 40:17.714
much to prepare.
I don't like it.

40:17.716 --> 40:20.950
Dead or alive, we got
a bigger problem... Regina.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.585
And what makes you say that?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.554
That beast was unable
to defeat her.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.122
As bad as Maleficent is,

40:26.124 --> 40:28.892
Regina's dark heart
is <i>far</i> worse.

40:28.894 --> 40:32.962
You are so filled
with assumptions.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.932
Regina is not the one
we have to worry about.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.467
What?

40:37.469 --> 40:39.269
That beast did seek out

40:39.270 --> 40:41.070
the heart with the greatest
potential for darkness, yes,

40:41.072 --> 40:44.507
but it was wasn't
going after Regina.

40:44.509 --> 40:46.476
It was after Emma Swan.

40:48.447 --> 40:49.979
What do you suppose the boy is
up to now?

40:49.981 --> 40:52.482
Being Henry.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.684
- Mm. - If anyone's gonna get
that author out of the book,

40:54.686 --> 40:56.453
it's him.
Hmm.

40:56.455 --> 40:57.921
You've become
quite the optimist, Swan.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.456
Have I?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.558
Guess I...
Couldn't really help it,

41:01.560 --> 41:03.393
between him and my parents.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.227
That reminds me. Aren't they
supposed to be here?

41:05.230 --> 41:09.065
You're right.
I wonder what's keeping them. [ beep ]

41:09.067 --> 41:10.900
[ cell phone rings ]

41:10.902 --> 41:12.235
[ ring ]

41:12.237 --> 41:13.670
[ ring ]

41:36.261 --> 41:39.796
<i>Cruella: Well, well, well.
Look who's here.</i>

41:39.798 --> 41:42.232
It's been a long time.

41:42.234 --> 41:43.933
We gotta talk.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.102
Oh, so the prince wants a chat?

41:46.104 --> 41:49.973
Okay, handsome. Talk.

41:49.975 --> 41:51.774
This is our town.

41:51.776 --> 41:53.510
If you've really
turned over a new leaf,

41:53.512 --> 41:54.944
you're welcome to stay.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.846
My, aren't we generous?

41:56.848 --> 41:58.281
On one condition.

41:59.818 --> 42:02.685
No one must ever know
what happened between us

42:02.687 --> 42:05.021
in the Enchanted Forest.

42:06.258 --> 42:09.559
And if you say one single word
to anyone,

42:09.561 --> 42:11.995
especially Emma,

42:11.997 --> 42:14.898
well, you won't have to worry
about the Evil Queen.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.568
I'll rip out your hearts myself.
