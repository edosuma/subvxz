AND SOMETHING WEIRD
THAT HAPPENED TO ME LAST NIGHT.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.480
- IT'S THE MORNING
OF THE PING-PONG TOURNAMENT,

11:29.563 --> 11:31.774
AND THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
IS HOLDING ITS BREATH.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.609
WHOA, AMBER.

11:33.692 --> 11:34.777
WAFFLES BEFORE A BIG MATCH?

11:34.860 --> 11:35.820
IS THAT REALLY A GOOD IDEA?

11:35.903 --> 11:38.781
- "A," YOU'RE NOT MY COACH
ANYMORE.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.574
"B," THEY'RE LOW-CARB WAFFLES.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.535
AND, "C," THERE'S MUSH
ON YOUR LENS.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.994
- NO, THERE ISN'T.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.331
AH, WELL, NOW THERE IS.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.792
[laughter]

11:51.710 --> 11:54.171
IT'S ALL GETTING TENSE
IN HERE,

11:54.255 --> 11:56.006
WAFFLEY TENSE.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.593
- OW, ALFIE!

11:59.677 --> 12:02.680

12:02.763 --> 12:04.682
[echoing] JUST SOME BIG KID.
JUST SOME BIG KID.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.101
JUST SOME BIG KID.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.407
- SAY, FABES,
YOU CHOSE THE MOVIE LAST TIME.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.909
I CHOOSE THIS TIME.

12:23.993 --> 12:24.994
- THIS TIME?

12:25.077 --> 12:25.995
- YEAH, AND I KNOW THE RULES:

12:26.078 --> 12:29.498
SALTED POPCORN,
NO STRAW-SHARING,

12:29.582 --> 12:32.251
AND DON'T TALK
OVER ANYTHING OLD OR EGYPTIAN.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.463
WE HAD FUN, DIDN'T WE?

12:35.546 --> 12:38.174
I'LL EVEN GET PATRICIA
TO CHAPERONE US,

12:38.257 --> 12:39.008
IF YOU'RE THAT WORRIED.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.427
- MAYBE.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.928
- GREAT, I'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.352
- NINA.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.562

12:51.645 --> 12:52.813
TO COME OUT TO THE TUNNELS
RIGHT NOW

12:52.897 --> 12:55.691
OR HEAR ABOUT MY RUN-IN
WITH SENKHARA LAST NIGHT.

12:55.774 --> 12:56.984
- NO, NINA, REALLY.

12:57.067 --> 12:57.485
ME AND JOY, WE'RE JUST--

12:57.568 --> 12:59.445
- FRIENDS?

12:59.528 --> 13:03.532
FUNNY, YOU AND I NEVER MADE IT
TO THE MOVIES

13:03.616 --> 13:05.868
AS FRIENDS OR OTHERWISE.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.496
- REALLY, REALLY, WHAT--

13:08.579 --> 13:12.124
- JUST FORGET IT, OKAY?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.543
FORGET EVERYTHING.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.795
[echoing] FORGET EVERYTHING.

13:23.010 --> 13:23.886

FORGET WHAT?

13:25.346 --> 13:28.891
- [cackling]

13:31.101 --> 13:34.563
- I KNOW YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
WANT ANY FUSS.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.901
- BUT WE COULDN'T LET YOU LEAVE
WITHOUT GIVING YOU THESE.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.904
IT'S FROM EVERYONE
AT ANUBIS HOUSE.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.989
- OH, THANK YOU.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.287
- I'M SO SORRY, MRS. ANDREWS.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.248
- OH, MARA.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.583
I TOLD YOU
I NEEDED TO GO ANYWAY.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.920
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, DAPHNE.

14:04.301 --> 14:09.014
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?

14:09.098 --> 14:10.683
- NO, ERIC.

14:10.766 --> 14:11.976
I CAN'T STAY IN A SCHOOL

14:12.059 --> 14:17.982
WHERE AN UNHINGED CARETAKER
CALLS THE SHOTS.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.108
I NEED A FRESH START

14:19.191 --> 14:22.278
SOMEWHERE WHERE THE CHILDREN
COME FIRST.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.445
- UM, WELL,

14:23.529 --> 14:26.782
GOOD LUCK, THEN.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.164
- AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU TOO.

14:34.248 --> 14:38.711
WITH A MAN LIKE THAT AROUND,
YOU'LL CERTAINLY NEED IT.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.839
- GOOD-BYE, DAPHNE.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.929
- SO...

14:49.013 --> 14:50.889
I GUESS I'M SORRY.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.977
- APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.854
- THAT'S IT?

14:56.937 --> 14:59.273
- WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

14:59.356 --> 15:00.441
YOU'VE WON.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.900
- [scoffs]

15:01.984 --> 15:04.194
- I SPOKE TO YOUR MOTHER
THIS MORNING.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.113
- I'M NOT GOING BACK, OKAY?

15:06.196 --> 15:08.657
- BUT I THOUGHT
THAT WAS WHAT YOU WANTED.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.784
- WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE, YEAH.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.498
BUT NOW THERE'S STUFF
TO STAY FOR.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.250
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.543
I MEAN, YOUR MOTHER THINKS
THAT YOU SHOULD GO--

15:19.627 --> 15:22.588
- OF COURSE, 'CAUSE YOU
TALKED HER INTO IT, RIGHT?

15:22.671 --> 15:23.672
ALWAYS TRYING TO WASH YOUR HANDS
OF ME.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.799
- IS THAT WHAT YOU REALLY THINK?

15:25.883 --> 15:27.968
- YOU DIDN'T WANT ME THEN,

15:28.052 --> 15:30.512
AND YOU DON'T WANT ME NOW.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.517
WHATEVER, OKAY?
BOOK THE FLIGHTS.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.019
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR LIFE AGAIN,
ERIC.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.020
IT'S FINE.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.856
- EDISON, WAIT.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.984
I INSIST YOU RESPECT ME
AS YOUR TEACHER,

15:44.068 --> 15:47.863
AND I WANT BETTER BEHAVIOR
IN CLASS.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.782
- [chuckles]

15:49.865 --> 15:51.950
IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT,
ISN'T IT?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.535
- NO.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.246
NOT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT
WANTING TO STAY IN THIS SCHOOL.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.458
- YEAH.

15:59.541 --> 16:03.212
- VERY WELL.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.046
- REALLY?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.006
- THERE IS ONE MORE CONDITION.

16:07.174 --> 16:11.470
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER
AS YOUR FATHER.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.059
- I STILL DON'T WANT PEOPLE
KNOWING WHO I AM.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.104
- WELL, THEY'LL FIND OUT
EVENTUALLY.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.482
SO?

16:23.565 --> 16:27.027
IS IT A DEAL?

16:33.659 --> 16:36.203
- DEAL, DAD.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.797
- "DAD."

16:48.006 --> 16:50.592
- HEY.
YACKER, HEY.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.969
HEY, HEY.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.637

16:53.721 --> 16:55.723
EDDIE MILLER, WAS IT?

16:55.806 --> 16:58.350
OR COULD IT BE, I DON'T KNOW,
EDISON SWEET?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.185
- SHH!
SHH!

17:00.269 --> 17:01.562
WILL YOU KEEP IT A SECRET?

17:01.645 --> 17:03.856
- WHY SHOULD I?

17:03.939 --> 17:05.232
- BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.777
- I'LL KEEP YOUR SECRET.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.069
- GREAT.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.781
- I DON'T THINK WE CAN EVER
BE FRIENDS, EDDIE.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.532
- BECAUSE YOU FOUND OUT
WHO MY DAD IS.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.534
- NO.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.661
BECAUSE I FOUND OUT
WHO YOU ARE.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.413
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.582
- I--

17:21.665 --> 17:24.917
- I DON'T RAT PEOPLE OUT,
REMEMBER?

17:25.919 --> 17:28.505
- BUT--

17:31.550 --> 17:34.303
[cheers and applause]

17:37.848 --> 17:39.808
- THERE'S THE SHIELD.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.687
- GOOD LUCK, JEROME.

17:43.771 --> 17:44.980
THE WHOLE SCHOOL
IS RELYING ON YOU

17:45.063 --> 17:48.192
TO BRING THAT BEAUTY HOME.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.735
- I THINK IT'S AMAZING,

17:49.818 --> 17:51.987
WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR DAD
WITH THE GEM AND EVERYTHING.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.364
- WHO TOLD YOU?

17:54.448 --> 17:55.240
- MARA.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.578
I GUESS DAD'S LUCK'S
ALREADY CHANGING.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.539
HEY, GERBIL?

18:02.623 --> 18:03.832
GOOD LUCK AND STUFF.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.418
- THANK YOU, POOPS.

18:07.628 --> 18:08.420

18:08.504 --> 18:10.839
HOW OUR STUDENTS
ARE PROGRESSING.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.299
- AND THEN YOU'LL COME
STRAIGHT BACK?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.176
NO GOING BEHIND MY BACK ANYMORE?

18:14.259 --> 18:16.303
- YES.
DON'T WORRY, VERA.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.679
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STICK
TOGETHER.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.722
REMEMBER, VICTOR--

18:18.806 --> 18:20.641
- YES, VERA!

18:30.108 --> 18:32.528
- SO WHY'D YOU GIVE IT ALL UP?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.112
- HMM?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.198
- PING-PONG.
WHY'D YOU GIVE IT UP?

18:36.740 --> 18:39.368
both: BOYS.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.245
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.705
THEY MAKE ME LOSE FOCUS.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.832
- AMBER?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.209
JEROME IS COUNTING ON YOU, OKAY?

18:47.292 --> 18:48.544
JUST GROW UP A LITTLE.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.546
OR A LOT.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.755
[echoing]
GROW UP A LITTLE.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.215
GROW UP A LITTLE.
GROW UP A LITTLE.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.716
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN DO IT.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.552
FOCUS, MILLINGTON.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.096
OW!

18:59.179 --> 19:02.224
I THINK I PULLED
A PING-PONG MUSCLE.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.225
- [claps twice]

19:03.308 --> 19:04.476
- GOOD LUCK.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.062

MAKE THEIR WAY

19:07.145 --> 19:08.689
TOWARDS THE TABLE?

19:08.772 --> 19:11.316
[cheers and applause]

19:20.075 --> 19:22.786

20:00.699 --> 20:03.285
[horn bellowing]

20:24.848 --> 20:26.391
- I'M SORRY.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.143
EXPLAIN THE RULES OF THIS AGAIN.

20:28.226 --> 20:32.022
- OKAY, IF THE PING-PONG NINJAS
SCORE TWO MORE POINTS,

20:32.105 --> 20:34.524
THEN IT'S GAME OVER
FOR JEROME AND AMBER.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.819
[crowd yelling]

20:37.903 --> 20:41.031

20:45.577 --> 20:47.120
[applause and whistles]

20:50.958 --> 20:52.459
- THEY LOSE THIS POINT,
AND THAT'S IT.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.090
- [clears throat]

21:10.394 --> 21:11.436

TODAY COULDN'T GET
ANY MORE DISAPPOINTING.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.706
LOSERS.

21:30.789 --> 21:31.790
- PATRICIA.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.875
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE
TO SAY,

21:33.959 --> 21:35.168
THEN DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.545

DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.838
DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.

21:37.921 --> 21:42.718

- ARE YOU OKAY?

21:47.597 --> 21:50.517
- [laughing]

21:50.600 --> 21:54.062
YOUR PUNISHMENT WILL BE

21:57.649 --> 21:59.901
I KNOW IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH SENKHARA.

21:59.985 --> 22:00.986

HOW LONG WAS I OUT?

22:34.770 --> 22:35.896
PATRICIA?

22:35.979 --> 22:38.440
ALFIE, WAIT UP.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.701

23:27.572 --> 23:29.658
BECAUSE OF YOU.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.955
[laughs]
