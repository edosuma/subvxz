in large part,

19:23.700 --> 19:25.788

that she has leaned on us,

could feel it, too,

of share a soul.

need to hear it musically,

make that decision together

- It's impossible

- That was selfish.

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.045
I make sacrifices for them.

01:03:17.045 --> 01:03:19.466

and they deserve it.

everything else in my life

No, it...
Everything's fine, guys.

to Lakeside?

possession of the camp

01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:05.079

would fail. But the truth is

Camp taught me
that my words are powerful.

01:23:09.469 --> 01:23:11.640
Without camp,
I would've never known

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.519
I could sing a high F
above middle C.

01:23:14.353 --> 01:23:15.648
At camp, I learned that

01:23:15.648 --> 01:23:17.067
you don't have to be pretty
to be talented.

01:23:17.067 --> 01:23:18.195
It's just a bonus.

01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:21.493
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.

01:23:21.619 --> 01:23:23.581
- I'm sorry.
- You finished the song.

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:25.585
It's so beautiful.

01:23:25.752 --> 01:23:26.962
I did it for you.

01:23:27.714 --> 01:23:30.344
You should do whatever
you wanna do

01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:31.805
and pursue your dreams, okay?

01:23:32.515 --> 01:23:33.809
I'm going to stay here.

01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:35.855
If there is a here,
I belong here.

01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:38.276
Well, I'll come back
all the time.

01:23:38.401 --> 01:23:39.487
- Promise?
- I promise.

01:23:39.655 --> 01:23:40.740
You're not getting rid of me.

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.078
At camp,
I learned to live in my truth

01:23:43.078 --> 01:23:44.539
as a heterosexual man.

01:23:46.042 --> 01:23:47.253
We knew. (SOBBING)

01:23:47.419 --> 01:23:49.340

Good job.

01:23:50.384 --> 01:23:51.512
Glenn is amazing.

01:23:51.679 --> 01:23:52.931
Glenn is so good,
it makes me upset.

01:23:53.098 --> 01:23:55.102
- It's insane.
- It makes me upset.

I hope I see you next summer.

Thanks for being
so hard on me.

01:24:51.632 --> 01:24:53.134
I know it was
for a good reason.
