WEBVTT

00:06.020 --> 00:07.899
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:07.900 --> 00:10.469
The Couple has power.
And they are not good people.

00:10.470 --> 00:11.620
Give me the page.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.499
If the finger's still
viable, I reattach.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.889
I'm Hyman Cooper.

00:16.890 --> 00:19.889
I was a student here in
the 1920s... a traveler.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.479
Someone moved my body.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.605
I stole this.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.316
Stasis charm... freezes
the wearer in time.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.469
Holy shit. Umber?

00:27.470 --> 00:30.196
You make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.073
More of a pocket world, really.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.879
I will get out of here.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.787
And then I'll turn you
into lobsters and eat you.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.080
Hey, what happened to your eye?

00:39.081 --> 00:40.290
I lent it to Josh.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.799
Your own personal Margo-Pro.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.001
Josh didn't die.

00:43.002 --> 00:46.337
- He was in the Taker Realm and...
- That's not possible.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.173
Somebody opened a door that
should not have been opened.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.883
It could mean the end of everything.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.510
I think I can't do what I need to do

00:52.511 --> 00:54.679
if I'm worried about how
it's gonna affect you.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.847
I think we need to be done.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.141
My pregnancy is going to be sped up?

00:58.142 --> 00:59.309
It's Red Monkey Month.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.559
Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.069
Wait, so you're saying that's a thing...

01:03.070 --> 01:06.179
me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

01:06.180 --> 01:07.189
Maybe.

01:07.190 --> 01:09.527
Well, maybe this baby's a traveler.

01:09.528 --> 01:14.283
Yeah, uh... we should probably talk.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.779
It seems like I missed a lot here.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.379
It's actually super simple.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.549
The Dark King, aka Rupert Chatwin,

01:24.550 --> 01:27.795
is trying to jailbreak his dead
lover out of hell or whatever,

01:27.796 --> 01:29.949
so he needs to get rid
of the guard dogs first.

01:29.950 --> 01:33.209
Hence, using you as a
human smallpox blanket

01:33.210 --> 01:34.589
to kill the Takers.

01:34.590 --> 01:37.930
Yeah, I-I meant more like, uh...

01:40.100 --> 01:42.518
Contraception wards are
supposed to be foolproof.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.599
Don't worry. My uterus is on lock.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.879
Right, 'cause a werewolf
baby could be...

01:47.880 --> 01:49.309
Yikes.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.689
But potentially very cute.

01:51.690 --> 01:53.572
Fucking adorable.

01:54.860 --> 01:58.660
Some day. Not now.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.639
I'm not giving birth to
a goddamn litter, Josh.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.100
Besides...

02:04.000 --> 02:06.620
I thought we were done.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.590
You risked your sanity to
save me from the Taker Realm.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.843
If that doesn't buy us
a clean slate, then...

02:17.360 --> 02:21.800
So can we skip to the reunion banging?

02:25.380 --> 02:27.979
- You're wearing three rubbers.
- At least.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.404
Have you been to a doctor?

02:36.405 --> 02:40.035
I mean, they don't exactly
have ultrasounds in Fillory.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.990
Have you thought about
what this means for us?

02:46.930 --> 02:48.869
What do you want it to mean?

02:48.870 --> 02:51.249
We broke up for good reasons.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.870
None of that has changed.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.340
My dad wasn't around for long.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.389
My mom...

03:01.390 --> 03:03.350
Look, I'm not doing that to our kid.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.600
I want to be there for him... her?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.397
No clue yet.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.233
I want you to be there, too.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.469
You guys.

03:13.470 --> 03:17.029
Um, I'm sorry, but, um,
there's a problem.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.909
We were in the elevator, and
Eliot and Fen just collapsed.

03:22.910 --> 03:24.940
Hello?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.680
Hello?

03:34.700 --> 03:36.680
Anyone?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.399
Eliot?

03:42.400 --> 03:45.959
Oh, it's you.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.889
What kind of Fillorian nonsense is this?

03:48.890 --> 03:51.899
- Or am I dreaming?
- I know I'm not.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.192
In my dreams, you're nice to me.

03:54.193 --> 03:57.999
What the shit is going on?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.259
Whoa, oh. Look away, look away.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.980
Still draping here.

04:01.990 --> 04:05.909
We were just settling on safe
words when we woke up here.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.209
- Any idea why?
- Mm.

04:08.210 --> 04:11.369
♪ Yoo-hoo ♪

04:19.640 --> 04:23.050
Welcome, High Kings.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.399
Ember. I thought you were dead.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.719
Oh, I am an energetic emanation,

04:27.720 --> 04:29.309
my dear blinking idiot.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.199
A message left by the great god Ember

04:32.200 --> 04:35.349
to forewarn of impending apocalypse.

04:35.350 --> 04:37.619
- I've met this guy before.
- Mm-hmm.

04:37.620 --> 04:38.999
I have brought you here because you are

04:39.000 --> 04:41.531
the living Former High Kings of Fillory,

04:41.532 --> 04:44.899
and your kingdom rests
on the knife's edge

04:44.900 --> 04:47.619
of annihilation.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.001
Huh.

04:59.260 --> 05:03.910
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

05:08.970 --> 05:11.186
You do realize I have
other things to do?

05:11.187 --> 05:12.539
Whatever.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.659
I just had to pull Josh's pants back on,

05:14.660 --> 05:17.099
- so diagnose.
- They're asleep.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.942
I mean, obviously, they're cursed

05:18.943 --> 05:20.699
or whatever. But beyond that,

05:20.700 --> 05:22.196
just wait and see if they wake up.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.539
Should we just slap them?

05:23.540 --> 05:25.283
Believe me, I tried.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.703
I'm gonna go see what we
have on narcolepsy spells.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.949
You were not pregnant
the last time I saw you,

05:32.950 --> 05:34.469
like, at all.

05:34.470 --> 05:37.713
Oh, yeah. Well, things happened fast.

05:42.470 --> 05:43.699
Everything looks fine for now,

05:43.700 --> 05:44.924
but I should do more scans.

05:44.925 --> 05:46.679
It looks like you have fast-forwarded

05:46.680 --> 05:48.439
through the first two trimesters.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.723
You're ready to pop.
Accelerated pregnancies

05:50.724 --> 05:51.739
can be dangerous.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.849
And, uh, it's a hybrid.

05:53.850 --> 05:56.564
Have you had any side effects?
Psychic episodes?

05:56.565 --> 05:59.259
Uh, yes, that I kind of caused myself.

05:59.260 --> 06:02.320
Yeah, she had to to get
out of, well, a dungeon.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.779
But none since.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.649
Um, actually, that's not entirely true.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.579
- Wait, what?
- A couple of aftershocks,

06:08.580 --> 06:09.779
but it's really no big deal.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.719
I've already put up every
mental ward I know.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.914
Okay.

06:12.915 --> 06:16.375
There are treatments, but they
have to be applied regularly.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.794
And the only place that it's
safe to cast right now is...

06:18.795 --> 06:19.921
The Brakebills Lab...

06:19.922 --> 06:22.079
because the Moon is still pissed at us.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.619
Uh, look, I'll be there
the minute I can.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.426
We're just dealing with some stuff.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.721
Clearly. Don't wait too long.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.499
As you ought to remember,

06:34.500 --> 06:36.140
I am activated by world war,

06:36.150 --> 06:37.772
pandemic, revolt of dwarves...

06:37.773 --> 06:39.299
Or the mass rising of the dead.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.520
Yeah, we know. We're already on it.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.694
Huzzah! And I have summoned all of you

06:43.695 --> 06:47.819
because the current ruler is the
nitwit causing the problem.

06:47.820 --> 06:49.993
The thing is he's sort of unkillable.

06:49.994 --> 06:52.279
I rescind my huzzah.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.419
In addition to being just very creepy,

06:55.420 --> 06:57.625
the dead drain life,

06:57.626 --> 06:59.543
contaminating everything they touch,

06:59.544 --> 07:01.959
like a pickle on a sandwich.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.965
- I like pickles.
- Behold!

07:03.966 --> 07:07.339
A dead person wriggling
from their grave.

07:10.550 --> 07:15.142
And this is every Fillorian
who has ever lived.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.396
You see?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.895
The pickles of the dead
will ruin Fillory.

07:20.896 --> 07:23.399
You must stop this, whatever the cost.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.320
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet,

07:26.321 --> 07:27.489
- which is...
- A decent option?

07:27.490 --> 07:29.219
I was gonna say counterproductive.

07:29.220 --> 07:31.979
Only if you care about
peasants, which I do not.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.089
- Do you want to get that, or...
- Oh, no.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.249
That's just...

07:39.250 --> 07:41.877
A mouse farted or something.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.580
A very gassy mouse.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.679
Umber.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.389
It is I,

07:53.390 --> 07:56.820
an energetic emanation of
Umber, great god of...

07:56.830 --> 07:59.109
Piss off. Nobody wants you here.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.359
I have heard your lamentations

08:01.360 --> 08:03.232
and am here to help.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.736
I was designed to intervene
if my anarchist brother

08:06.737 --> 08:10.359
tries something stupid,
like blowing up the planet.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.599
Do you have a better suggestion?

08:13.600 --> 08:16.789
I do, sweet matron of Fillory.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.989
After I faked my own death,

08:18.990 --> 08:21.667
I fled to Earth and built new worlds.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.309
- Didn't finish any.
- Did too.

08:24.310 --> 08:25.337
Mostly.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.632
I intended to rescue my people
from this chaotic place,

08:28.633 --> 08:30.968
so I also built an ark.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.804
- Like a big-ass boat?
- A pocket world.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.264
A temporary vessel

08:35.265 --> 08:38.679
that pulls every living
Fillorian off the planet

08:38.679 --> 08:42.958
so that I might deliver them
to a new, more perfect world.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.469
So you're saying we can use
the ark, rescue the people,

08:46.470 --> 08:49.119
blow up Fillory, and stop the Dark King?

08:49.120 --> 08:52.029
If anyone is gonna destroy
this putrid stank-hole,

08:52.030 --> 08:53.741
it will be me.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.702
Oh!

08:58.820 --> 09:01.909
Oh, my gods!

09:01.910 --> 09:03.539
Guys...

09:03.540 --> 09:06.159
Then they just slapped
each other over and over

09:06.160 --> 09:07.254
for hours.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.341
I think they forgot we were there.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.659
Okay, I'm just having a
hard time with the part

09:11.660 --> 09:14.219
where we save Fillory by destroying it.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.640
Yeah. It seems extreme.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.350
And what happens to magic?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.185
I mean, the Wellspring is on Fillory.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.529
Well, we don't know.

09:22.530 --> 09:23.799
But our only other choice is

09:23.800 --> 09:26.389
to let the dead spill into our world.

09:26.390 --> 09:27.539
Every world.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.111
The pocket world is temporary.

09:29.112 --> 09:31.719
So where do we put all
the Fillorians... Earth?

09:31.720 --> 09:33.698
Have you seen how we
treat our own refugees?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.449
What about the World Seed?

09:37.450 --> 09:40.239
From Q's page.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.799
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world...

09:43.800 --> 09:45.127
a new Fillory.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.209
That's insane...

09:49.210 --> 09:50.629
in a good way.

09:50.630 --> 09:52.379
And a bad way.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.176
I think The Couple have the seed.

09:54.177 --> 09:57.139
And the page they stole is
just an instruction manual.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.499
It's useless on its own.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.017
And they went to some pretty
extreme lengths to get it.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.199
Upside is we have time.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.938
And the Moon will keep
them from casting on it.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.024
And it's in a dead language
I couldn't decipher.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.409
I took pictures, but...

10:10.410 --> 10:12.486
Okay, well, if you work
on finding the seed,

10:12.487 --> 10:13.946
I can work on the language.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.059
Sticking us with grabbing the
ark thingy from Umber's.

10:17.060 --> 10:19.819
Oh, Quentin and I went
once. It's in Vancouver.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.349
- Is your traveling still jacked?
- Yeah.

10:23.350 --> 10:25.124
But there is someone who could help.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.459
Okay, buddy.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.160
If you can hear me...

10:36.300 --> 10:38.030
Be the Hyman.

11:01.900 --> 11:04.289
I'm a-alive?

11:04.290 --> 11:06.329
Yeah.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.379
Thank you. Thank you.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.409
Whore!

11:44.410 --> 11:46.199
Oh.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.290
Ugh.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.168
Just kidding.

11:55.690 --> 11:59.439
Oh, my God. Ah, this is incredible.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.888
I love fingering things.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.659
Right, okay.

12:04.660 --> 12:06.389
How about a few

12:06.390 --> 12:08.639
"being alive in the
21st-century" ground rules?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.179
- Mm.
- First of all,

12:10.180 --> 12:12.990
you can't act like a
fucking pervert anymore.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.520
Even white dudes can't
get away with that shit.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.109
Most of the time.

12:17.110 --> 12:19.489
People can see you and hear you and...

12:19.490 --> 12:22.989
And smell you. Sorry, pregnancy nose.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.219
- No.
- Ow.

12:25.220 --> 12:27.249
Ground rules, Hyman.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.979
Okay, boys, let's get back
on mission, shall we?

12:29.980 --> 12:32.876
Uh, we need you to travel
some people to Umber's house.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.939
You think you can do it?

12:33.940 --> 12:36.880
You guys need me? Whoa.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.279
My traveling's a little rusty,

12:38.280 --> 12:40.092
but I'll do whatever you guys need.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.129
Yeah, about that...

12:47.840 --> 12:50.269
You wouldn't know it
from how stoic I was,

12:50.270 --> 12:53.959
but it was the worst pain
anyone has ever felt.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.239
Wow, that's neat. Here's
the address to Umber's.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.999
Are you sure you can do this?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.155
- Buddy, I know my onions.
- That means yes?

13:01.156 --> 13:03.658
That must mean yes.

13:04.990 --> 13:08.489
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

13:08.490 --> 13:11.119
Remind me. You are...

13:11.120 --> 13:13.792
- Fen.
- Fen.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.919
Eliot's wife.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.829
- Fillory girl.
- Oh, of course, Fillory girl.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.217
You're the... you're the
one who loves forks.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.709
- What's got you grummy?
- I'm fine.

13:24.710 --> 13:27.769
As a seasoned viewer of people,

13:27.770 --> 13:30.839
I think you're upset
'cause their plan is zany,

13:30.840 --> 13:32.679
and you know if you speak
up, they won't listen.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.479
What? No.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.939
Their... their plan is great.
And they do listen to me.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.019
Didn't Eliot say you were a hayseed

13:41.020 --> 13:43.479
from a backwards prolapsed
asshole of a planet?

13:43.480 --> 13:46.618
Or were you not there?

13:47.800 --> 13:51.079
- Okay, outsider to outsider...
- Yeah?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.669
Doesn't this feel like
the part in the story

13:53.670 --> 13:56.829
where the good guys are just wrong?

13:56.830 --> 13:59.254
Hearts in the right place,
but they haven't learned

13:59.255 --> 14:01.799
the lesson of this little
morality play they're in yet.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.550
So they have this crazy plan

14:03.551 --> 14:06.011
that makes them almost
as bad as the villain.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.719
- Oh.
- Or maybe it's just me.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.897
I did it.

14:19.230 --> 14:20.609
I really did it.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.529
We'll ring you when we're
ready to travel back.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.119
I'm not coming with you inside?

14:24.120 --> 14:26.198
We're all full up on perverts here.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.616
Oh.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.202
Oh, that's... that's... that's fine.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.609
I've got other stuff
to do. I'm... I'm...

14:33.610 --> 14:35.749
Maybe I'll go Google myself.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.879
You know what? Knock...
knock yourself out.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.309
That's...

14:39.310 --> 14:40.713
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.219
I'm sorry.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.559
The master of the house
isn't available right now.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.039
Please return another time.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.225
Wait, why does he look
like Umber, but boring?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.811
That's his human form, for
blending in with Canadians.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.799
Must be another emanation.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.189
He's a ghost butler.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.579
♪ Who you gonna call? ♪

15:00.580 --> 15:02.339
That guy.

15:02.340 --> 15:04.639
We spoke to the horny
version of you in Fillory.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.114
He sent us here to get a thing.

15:06.115 --> 15:07.439
Can we?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.616
In the beginning, there was nothing

15:09.617 --> 15:12.327
until a tigress, blind in one eye,

15:12.328 --> 15:14.879
came to a lonely shore.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.849
The tigress looked upon
this raw world, and...

15:17.850 --> 15:20.749
And... what?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.299
I'm sorry.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.964
The master of the house isn't available.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.659
I think ghost butler is broken.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.520
Or it's a test.

15:28.530 --> 15:30.637
Solve the puzzle, get in the door.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.639
How could it be a test?

15:31.640 --> 15:34.129
He's just spouting random nonsense.

15:34.130 --> 15:37.739
Oh, it's not random.
It's Fillorian scripture.

15:37.740 --> 15:38.999
The birth of Ember and Umber.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.064
You guys haven't heard this story?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.650
What happens next?

15:43.651 --> 15:47.149
Well, the tigress...

15:47.150 --> 15:50.659
she waded into the ocean
and drowned herself.

15:50.660 --> 15:53.489
And as her body disappeared
beneath the waves,

15:53.490 --> 15:55.949
two shells washed ashore.

15:55.950 --> 15:59.079
And from those shells came Ember

15:59.080 --> 16:01.711
and then his shadow, Umber.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.859
Welcome.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.924
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

16:16.010 --> 16:18.319
Ow.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.640
God, shut up.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.981
Julia.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.519
I'm fine. I'm just...

16:25.520 --> 16:28.050
It's a little bit of
aftershock, that's all.

16:36.860 --> 16:38.159
Hyman.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.119
Penny, did you know they
sell pre-sliced bread now?

16:42.120 --> 16:46.129
That's the greatest invention
since... I don't even know what.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.739
Your parents... were they magicians?

16:48.740 --> 16:52.009
No. Uh, Dad was a
door-to-door snake salesman.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.379
Snake oil?

16:53.380 --> 16:54.549
No.

16:54.550 --> 16:57.057
And my mom worked at a brothel.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.226
You know, just mopping.

16:58.227 --> 17:01.439
Okay, did she, um...

17:01.440 --> 17:04.559
Did she suffer from any mental problems?

17:04.560 --> 17:07.858
Psychic stuff from being
pregnant with you?

17:07.859 --> 17:09.729
Oh, no. Nothing like that.

17:09.730 --> 17:14.118
After the lobotomy,
she mostly just sat on the porch

17:14.119 --> 17:16.540
and sucked at bits of hay.

17:17.790 --> 17:21.009
Other than that,
she was the perfect mother.

17:21.010 --> 17:23.041
Okay, come on. I-I need
your help with something.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.200
Put the sandwich down!

17:28.500 --> 17:30.250
You want to find The Couple?

17:30.258 --> 17:34.089
They're a myth like the
Boogeyman or Santa Claus.

17:34.090 --> 17:37.919
Ah, Santa is very real,
and so are The Couple.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.929
We met one of them.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.419
The only other person that I know

17:42.420 --> 17:45.799
who believes they're real is Marina.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.524
Well, the last time we saw her,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.319
we screwed her over, moved the Moon,

17:49.320 --> 17:50.599
stopped the Harmonic Convergence,

17:50.600 --> 17:51.619
which she was gonna use

17:51.620 --> 17:54.239
for some heist-of-the-century
type of deal.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.709
Oh, I didn't say that she'll help you.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.911
I just said she's the only one who can.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.779
Pretty by-the-numbers defensive wards.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.966
Marina's not a
by-the-numbers kind of girl.

18:20.130 --> 18:21.601
You guys.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.021
- Come here.
- Uh, uh...

18:25.880 --> 18:30.469
Kady, I just wanted to tell
you that I am so sorry

18:30.470 --> 18:32.195
for all of the times that I've hurt you.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.572
Come inside for cookies?

18:39.050 --> 18:41.190
What the fuck was that?

18:47.880 --> 18:51.519
I'm still learning how
to bake, so no judging.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.689
Well, go ahead. They're not poisoned.

18:54.690 --> 18:56.699
But they might be.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.589
Marina, why are you...

18:59.590 --> 19:01.719
- Nice?
- Mm-hmm.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.359
Well, this might surprise you...

19:03.360 --> 19:06.829
but I made some bad choices in the past.

19:06.830 --> 19:10.839
And I needed to fix that,
so I went to a trance healer.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.119
Um...

19:12.120 --> 19:14.269
she put a block on all the
parts of my personality

19:14.270 --> 19:15.609
that made aggressive,

19:15.610 --> 19:18.179
but ultimately
self-destructive, choices.

19:18.180 --> 19:20.451
This feels like a scam.

19:21.650 --> 19:24.879
That's a weird scam.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.579
I'm not asking you for anything.

19:27.580 --> 19:32.797
And you came to me. Seems
like you need something?

19:34.260 --> 19:36.175
We're looking for The Couple.

19:40.130 --> 19:41.629
Well, this has been great,

19:41.630 --> 19:43.474
but I actually have to
get ready for church.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.359
But you know who they are.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.599
I know that going after them

19:46.600 --> 19:50.060
is the very definition of
an "Old Marina" decision.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.249
Look, I want to help you. I do, really.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.070
If it was anything else...

19:57.071 --> 19:59.089
But they have something we need

19:59.090 --> 20:01.825
to stop the end of everything.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.279
The World Seed.

20:03.280 --> 20:08.329
The most valuable object in
the multiverse, people say...

20:08.330 --> 20:11.039
which is why I wanted to steal it...

20:11.040 --> 20:14.713
until you stopped the
Harmonic Convergence.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.840
Wait, that was your
heist of the century?

20:16.841 --> 20:18.909
Wait. So you could help us steal it.

20:18.910 --> 20:19.999
No. No, no, no.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.263
I-I don't do things like that anymore.

20:22.264 --> 20:26.224
Stealing from The Couple...
people will get hurt.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.727
Way more people will get
hurt if you don't help us.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.729
Alice, friends don't
make friends grapple

20:31.730 --> 20:32.856
with the Trolley Problem.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.485
They cut off my fingers.
There's no gray area here.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.368
They're hiding the seed inside
a hotel called The Nave.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.949
I've been there.

20:46.950 --> 20:49.499
They only let in Magicians.
Everything about it is secret.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.291
It has a vault.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.003
It's the most secure
place on the planet.

20:54.004 --> 20:56.119
But you had a plan to break in.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.209
I had partners.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.640
We spent months constructing a map

20:59.650 --> 21:01.739
of every inch of that
hotel and its defenses.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.119
We called it our heist book.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.889
Problem is, things got really crazy,

21:06.890 --> 21:09.476
and I don't actually know
where the book ended up.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.150
But I know someone who might.

21:17.230 --> 21:19.979
Hey, buddy. Been a minute.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.099
Need some ice chips

21:21.100 --> 21:23.069
- or something?
- Oh, Christ, no. Go away.

21:23.070 --> 21:25.451
- Is that Gavin from the Library?
- He doesn't...

21:25.452 --> 21:27.319
I don't work for the
sodding library anymore.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.203
- Yeah.
- What happened to you?

21:29.204 --> 21:30.373
She didn't tell you?

21:30.374 --> 21:33.849
Marina hired me and a
few other poor bastards

21:33.850 --> 21:35.349
to rob The Couple.

21:35.350 --> 21:37.619
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

21:37.620 --> 21:39.297
without the Harmonic Convergence.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.999
Marina sent us in anyway.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.049
One guy was killed,
horribly, I might add.

21:44.050 --> 21:46.139
I was lucky.

21:46.140 --> 21:49.029
But now I'm stuck here,
a bag of shattered bones,

21:49.030 --> 21:51.259
can't travel, with fucking
Daryl over there

21:51.260 --> 21:53.479
talking my fucking ear
off all day and night.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.100
And so help me God, if you wake him up,

21:56.107 --> 21:57.607
I will kill all of your mothers.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.314
Marina beat you to that one.

21:59.315 --> 22:00.940
Then why are you working with her?

22:01.904 --> 22:04.447
Marina, maybe you should step outside.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.540
Mm.

22:09.450 --> 22:12.279
We're not fans of Marina or The Couple,

22:12.280 --> 22:13.639
but we need the World Seed.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.041
So, if you could just give
us the heist book, we can...

22:15.042 --> 22:17.043
I would sooner shit my cast.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.129
Well, it looks like that's
gonna happen either way,

22:19.130 --> 22:20.335
so why not help us?

22:20.336 --> 22:22.419
Because that would mean helping Marina.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.059
And if you think I'm gonna do that,

22:24.060 --> 22:26.659
then you have few 'roos loose
in the top paddock, love.

22:26.660 --> 22:32.139
So either find a way to scratch
my ass or get the hell out.

22:32.140 --> 22:34.394
That's why you did the spell
to make yourself good.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.139
Because you sent them
on a suicide mission.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.481
I thought maybe they'd get lucky.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.276
- Well, they really didn't.
- We need that heist book.

22:41.277 --> 22:44.149
How did you convince Gavin to
help you in the first place?

22:44.150 --> 22:46.599
I had leverage.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.919
Well, then use it now.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.319
That would be deeply unethical.

22:52.990 --> 22:55.457
I think I'm gonna go get him a smoothie.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.501
- What?
- Ugh.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.878
If he won't help us, we're stuck.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.499
We can't be stuck.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.548
We need the book. We need Marina.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.339
Or...

23:05.340 --> 23:07.302
we need to be Marina.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.306
Oh, God.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.893
Look, we understand.
You don't want to help us.

23:13.894 --> 23:16.059
We can't make you,

23:16.060 --> 23:17.729
but we can take down your wards.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.439
You're a traveler.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.401
Without mental wards,
you'll hear people's thoughts,

23:22.402 --> 23:25.659
all day, all night, even
while they're sleeping.

23:25.660 --> 23:27.249
If you do that while the Moon is borked,

23:27.250 --> 23:28.322
my head will be, too.

23:28.323 --> 23:31.399
I recently had several fingers
amputated and reattached.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.244
I'd be more concerned
about that if I were you.

23:35.330 --> 23:38.299
I underestimated you, Book Tart.

23:38.300 --> 23:39.877
You're worse than Marina.

23:39.878 --> 23:42.169
No.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.673
Just desperate.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.619
Bugger you all to hell. Stop.

23:51.620 --> 23:53.264
The heist book.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.183
I can't give it to you
because I don't have it.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.159
- Who does?
- Anna.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.937
She took it after things
went pear-shaped.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.529
Who is Anna?

24:00.530 --> 24:01.774
Ask her.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.572
Well, now we have a real problem.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.080
Is that Chinese and ice cream?

24:17.081 --> 24:20.000
You could smell that?

24:20.001 --> 24:22.209
I have a new superpower.
So what'd you get?

24:22.210 --> 24:23.449
Uh, well, I-I...

24:23.450 --> 24:26.739
Didn't know what you were craving,

24:26.740 --> 24:29.427
so everything. Also...

24:32.263 --> 24:34.229
The Circumstances Control Panel?

24:34.230 --> 24:35.515
Did you steal that from the Lab?

24:35.516 --> 24:37.229
Hyman helped.

24:37.230 --> 24:40.079
We figured if The Couple is
gonna use the World Seed,

24:40.080 --> 24:41.369
they need clean magic.

24:41.370 --> 24:44.024
So, without this, they are stuck.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.569
Hence, hiding it here.

24:45.570 --> 24:47.486
If it were going to be here anyway,

24:47.487 --> 24:49.599
I figured Lipson could come by,

24:49.600 --> 24:52.059
do the treatments, run some scans...

24:52.060 --> 24:53.079
two birds.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.659
Right, but Lipson said
the baby was fine.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.499
She said she needed to do more tests.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.869
She said it might be dangerous.

24:58.870 --> 25:00.459
And you said you'd have my back,

25:00.460 --> 25:01.708
and instead, you're trapping me here?

25:01.709 --> 25:04.319
She has to reapply the
treatments every couple hours.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.379
I'm just looking out
for you and the baby.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.439
I mean, somebody has to.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.885
Oh, shit.

25:12.730 --> 25:14.304
Sorry, I'll be quiet. Go on.

25:14.305 --> 25:17.307
You can't eavesdrop on
people's shit like that.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.309
But...

25:18.310 --> 25:20.269
Yeah, Hyman, you have a body now.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.021
You really need to
understand boundaries.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.439
- So do you.
- Julia, wait.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.196
Ooh. Uh-oh.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.113
I stumbled upon this place last time

25:33.114 --> 25:35.049
when I was looking for the bathroom.

25:35.050 --> 25:37.619
This is where he keeps all of his...

25:37.620 --> 25:39.629
pocket worlds.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.589
What the fuck?

25:41.590 --> 25:44.042
I swear, this place was
full of them last time.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.336
Well, where the shit did they go?

25:46.337 --> 25:49.039
Oh, "The Chankly Bore." Oh...

25:49.040 --> 25:50.699
I grew up playing Queen of the Hump

25:50.700 --> 25:51.799
on hills just like this.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.844
If it isn't the ark,
I don't give a shit.

25:53.850 --> 25:56.049
Okay...

25:56.050 --> 25:57.219
Ghost butler?

25:57.220 --> 25:59.099
I don't think it works like that.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.179
You can't just summon him.
He's not our butler.

26:02.180 --> 26:04.399
Oh! Hi.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.689
Greetings. How may I assist you?

26:06.690 --> 26:07.941
We're looking for a pocket world.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.776
The master of the house
is not available.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.410
We know.

26:11.420 --> 26:13.320
And so all pocket worlds
have been removed

26:13.330 --> 26:14.573
for security purposes.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.199
It's okay. Umber sent us to get it.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.701
He... he told us it'd be here.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.578
Which world did he send you to retrieve?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.915
It's called The Ark.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.120
Very well.

26:28.730 --> 26:30.879
If Umber sent you on this task,

26:30.880 --> 26:33.559
you should be able to
identify the true ark.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.919
- But if you choose poorly...
- Ooh!

26:36.920 --> 26:40.779
Uh, we age really fast,
and then we all turn to dust

26:40.780 --> 26:43.184
- just like in "the Last Crusade."
- Indeed.

26:43.185 --> 26:46.019
This security precaution is
inspired by my master's love

26:46.020 --> 26:47.969
for "Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade."

26:47.970 --> 26:48.982
For copyright purposes,

26:48.983 --> 26:51.049
the consequences of an incorrect choice

26:51.050 --> 26:53.821
has been changed to
something more explosive.

26:53.822 --> 26:58.200
- Choose...
- Wisely. Yeah, we get it.

27:00.730 --> 27:01.953
All right, Fen.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.206
You're the Fillory expert. Have at it.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.739
Any day now.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.549
You know what?

27:17.550 --> 27:20.249
Figure it out yourself.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.969
You need to let me do the talking.

27:28.970 --> 27:30.079
This is sensitive.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.599
How did you fuck over Anna, huh?

27:31.600 --> 27:33.099
She lose a limb or something?

27:33.100 --> 27:34.709
Well, I definitely fucked her.

27:34.710 --> 27:36.859
- Wait, she's your...
- Anna.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.991
Marina.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.162
- I want nothing to do with you.
- Anna, please.

27:43.163 --> 27:45.121
It's an emergency.

27:48.950 --> 27:50.627
It wasn't just one lie.

27:50.628 --> 27:53.300
It was how one led to
another and another.

27:53.631 --> 27:55.713
And now I don't know
if any of it was real.

27:55.714 --> 27:58.509
Did you know that she was
from a different timeline?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.136
'Cause I didn't.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.138
And then you tried to rob The Couple.

28:02.139 --> 28:05.183
Our friend died because of you.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.629
I know. I was a terrible person.

28:08.630 --> 28:12.319
I was a greedy, self-centered sociopath.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.109
And when you left me, I deserved it.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.569
But I'm making amends now.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.259
I've done a bunch of
things on your list.

28:19.260 --> 28:20.448
I got the trance healing done.

28:20.449 --> 28:23.701
But yet, here you are,
asking for the heist book.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.079
Oh, wait, no, that's just for us.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.779
Or maybe this is just another lie,

28:27.780 --> 28:31.501
and you aren't better,
y-you aren't different at all.

28:31.502 --> 28:34.963
Look, trust me. She is very different.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.789
- I mean, she baked us cookies.
- Yeah.

28:36.790 --> 28:39.259
Really terrible cookies.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.552
I don't trust you, okay?
You showed up with her.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.097
Just give us the book, and we'll go.

28:44.098 --> 28:46.769
We'll never pull her into our
life of crime ever again.

28:46.770 --> 28:49.144
Marina doesn't have to
be involved anymore.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.110
But I do.

28:55.710 --> 28:57.699
I'm sorry. I literally can't lie.

28:57.700 --> 29:02.069
This isn't simple like robbing a bank.

29:02.070 --> 29:03.419
You can't do it without me.

29:03.420 --> 29:06.244
And plus, I promised I would help you.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.159
At least you're honest.

29:14.130 --> 29:17.039
I'm gonna take the spell off Marina.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.079
- What?
- The Healer would have used

29:19.080 --> 29:20.439
a synaptic blocker...

29:20.440 --> 29:22.674
easy to remove, even under
weird circumstances.

29:22.675 --> 29:24.929
You want to bring back the bad Marina?

29:24.930 --> 29:27.919
To get the book,
we need her to tell Anna

29:27.920 --> 29:29.319
that she's not gonna
help with the heist.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.509
We need her to lie.

29:30.510 --> 29:33.849
You're the one who said that
we should be like Marina.

29:33.850 --> 29:36.025
This time we need the real Marina.

29:36.980 --> 29:39.149
Yeah, I think she needs a minute.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.439
- What are you doing?
- Word-as-bond spell.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.819
It's a magically binding contract

29:45.820 --> 29:47.859
that guarantees that you
will get the book for us

29:47.860 --> 29:50.455
and, when you help us with the
heist, you won't fuck us over.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.029
Well, you don't need that.

29:52.030 --> 29:53.999
I mean, with the spell I'm under,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.170
I couldn't betray you
even if I wanted to.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.920
Better safe than sorry.

30:05.010 --> 30:08.310
Julia? Are you here?

30:11.920 --> 30:13.645
What are you doing?

30:13.650 --> 30:14.920
Just stretching.

30:16.820 --> 30:18.849
You're trying to put
yourself into stasis.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.699
- What the hell, man?
- To be honest,

30:20.700 --> 30:23.781
I haven't really enjoyed
this episode of my life.

30:23.782 --> 30:26.579
What is so great about
having a body anyway?

30:26.580 --> 30:28.199
Y-you're hungry all the time.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.279
Everything you do makes you sore.

30:30.280 --> 30:33.839
You're pooping constantly.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.679
That hasn't been my experience,

30:36.680 --> 30:39.239
but your body's been in a bench

30:39.240 --> 30:41.798
for a century, man. Give it a minute.

30:41.799 --> 30:45.119
And when dramatic things are
happening to your friends,

30:45.120 --> 30:46.678
you can't even watch.

30:48.350 --> 30:50.681
This is about me and Julia?

30:50.682 --> 30:53.729
You're pissed because
you can't listen in

30:53.730 --> 30:57.699
on everyone's personal conversations?

30:57.700 --> 31:00.569
- It's none of your business.
- But it is.

31:00.570 --> 31:01.879
I put you two together.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.155
I-I shipped you before you
even shipped yourselves.

31:05.156 --> 31:08.239
Before, I was a part of everything.

31:08.240 --> 31:12.439
And now I am a, uh, minor character

31:12.440 --> 31:14.490
in my own story.

31:14.498 --> 31:15.909
God.

31:21.050 --> 31:24.259
Well, that's...

31:24.260 --> 31:25.789
that's the trade-off.

31:25.790 --> 31:30.599
You don't get to spy on
people's intimate moments.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.849
You get to live your own.

31:31.850 --> 31:34.060
And that's supposed to be better?

31:35.540 --> 31:38.159
If people wanted to talk to me,

31:38.160 --> 31:40.357
you think I would have done
this in the first place?

31:42.380 --> 31:44.445
So spying on the showers was...

31:45.280 --> 31:46.488
Loneliness.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.110
And horniness.

31:52.150 --> 31:55.089
You're never gonna make a
connection by hiding, Hyman.

31:55.090 --> 31:57.019
You got to put yourself out there.

31:57.020 --> 32:00.751
Just be honest with people.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.296
It may take a minute,

32:03.297 --> 32:05.716
but you'll find someone
who can stand you.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.269
Ah, are you doing that thing

32:09.270 --> 32:11.305
where you're giving me advice
but it's just for you?

32:11.306 --> 32:13.329
No, I'm trying to...

32:15.220 --> 32:18.659
Oh, God damn it.

32:18.660 --> 32:20.300
I got to find Julia.

32:22.010 --> 32:23.659
While I'm gone,

32:23.660 --> 32:25.819
promise me you're not
gonna stasis yourself.

32:25.820 --> 32:28.359
Well...

32:28.360 --> 32:30.569
Give me the locket.

32:34.700 --> 32:38.329
Talk to somebody. Have a conversation.

32:56.750 --> 32:59.469
Hello? Is someone there?

33:03.680 --> 33:07.459
Ah, Miss Wicker.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.279
I have been looking for you.

33:11.900 --> 33:14.326
Yes, it's come to this.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.793
Sir Effingham, what are you
doing with that trash can?

33:22.794 --> 33:25.079
Some hapless fellow

33:25.080 --> 33:28.005
left a sandwich of roast beef in there,

33:28.006 --> 33:29.899
and as I could not get
to market today...

33:29.900 --> 33:32.630
Oh! Oh, my heavens.

33:32.636 --> 33:35.799
You have embraced the
blessing of your sex.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.889
But surely you have misplaced
your wedding band?

33:39.890 --> 33:41.311
You are widowed, then?

33:41.312 --> 33:43.139
- No.
- Oh, you poor dear.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.189
You are carrying a bastard.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.519
Definitely talking to one.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.943
Look, I thought you chose
Todd for this quest.

33:48.944 --> 33:52.614
I fear he is not the intrepid
hero I once thought him to be.

33:52.615 --> 33:53.879
You don't say.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.279
Which is why,

33:55.280 --> 33:57.669
in my gravest hour of need,

33:57.670 --> 34:01.199
I have come to vouchsafe you a quest.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.957
Look, if this has to do with Fillory...

34:02.958 --> 34:06.389
For my vision of Fillory's
demise has grown clearer.

34:06.390 --> 34:09.759
I now see those who would bring
the apocalypse to Fillory

34:09.760 --> 34:12.168
have visited many times before.

34:12.170 --> 34:15.379
They enter from a distant
realm through a tree.

34:15.380 --> 34:18.514
- Like a portal tree?
- Indeed.

34:18.514 --> 34:22.168
These fiends plan to thieve
away every soul in the land

34:22.170 --> 34:24.438
before they destroy it outright.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.580
Huh.

34:27.449 --> 34:29.688
How exactly do they do that?

34:29.690 --> 34:33.159
My vision is hazy, but I do know

34:33.170 --> 34:35.866
that they will turn back
the clock on Fillory,

34:35.867 --> 34:37.978
resulting in ruin.

34:37.980 --> 34:39.879
Um...

34:39.880 --> 34:41.559
do these fiends... do they...

34:41.560 --> 34:44.049
do they succeed in stealing the people

34:44.050 --> 34:45.375
and building a new world for them?

34:45.376 --> 34:47.179
That much I do not know because...

34:47.179 --> 34:49.129
Wait.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.672
I made no mention of a new world.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.589
It is you.

34:54.590 --> 34:55.920
It's for Fillory's own good.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.049
The dead will rise.

34:57.050 --> 34:58.722
This is the only way that
we can save everyone.

34:58.723 --> 35:00.209
Oh, hogwash!

35:00.210 --> 35:03.929
What dark forces have
corrupted your fair mind?

35:03.930 --> 35:06.619
You have. We wouldn't be on this quest

35:06.620 --> 35:08.147
if you hadn't told me about
it in the first place.

35:08.148 --> 35:11.068
Are you now blaming me
for your own villainy?

35:11.069 --> 35:13.599
Oh, the ways of the sow

35:13.600 --> 35:16.329
are nastier than I thought possible.

35:16.330 --> 35:18.199
But... but know this.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.203
The death of Fillory cannot
come without a cost.

35:21.204 --> 35:22.663
What do you mean?

35:23.820 --> 35:28.540
Those who would destroy her
will lose the ones they love.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.499
So we're sorry for treating you

35:46.500 --> 35:50.329
like the friend who only gets
invited to trivia night.

35:50.330 --> 35:53.469
You know I don't know what that means.

35:53.470 --> 35:54.569
Yeah.

35:58.540 --> 36:00.739
Will you please help us choose a globe?

36:00.740 --> 36:02.319
Margo is chomping at the bit,

36:02.320 --> 36:05.059
and Josh is holding her off
for as long as he can.

36:05.060 --> 36:07.249
I thought I could talk myself into this.

36:08.360 --> 36:11.211
But I just keep thinking,
if this was Earth,

36:11.212 --> 36:15.589
you would try a lot harder
to find some other way.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.049
Yeah, probably.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.219
So maybe it's my job
to represent Fillory.

36:20.220 --> 36:24.199
But not just the people, the place...

36:24.200 --> 36:25.699
the history,

36:25.700 --> 36:29.349
the things we can't take with us.

36:29.350 --> 36:32.816
You want my permission to destroy it.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.479
I can't give that to you.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.573
Well, if you have any other
ideas, we are all ears.

36:39.574 --> 36:43.319
- Do you?
- No.

36:50.167 --> 36:53.289
Was that supposed to do that?

36:53.290 --> 36:56.380
Fillorians write down their
prayers to Umber and burn them.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.799
This must be where they show up.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.926
So they still pray to him
even though he's dead?

37:00.927 --> 37:03.499
I know what you're thinking.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.039
It's just like the people of Fillory

37:05.040 --> 37:06.849
to do something so stupid.

37:06.850 --> 37:10.059
No. I was thinking...

37:10.060 --> 37:14.759
it's taken me a really long
time to, uh, figure out

37:14.760 --> 37:18.980
that you can still love
something even after it's gone.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.739
Even if you helped kill it?

37:24.560 --> 37:25.709
Okay, Fen.

37:25.710 --> 37:29.580
It's time for a "come to Umber" talk.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.659
You don't want to be a sidekick?

37:31.660 --> 37:35.299
You want to have a say?
This is what that feels like.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.439
I'm not asking for your permission.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.999
Some part of Fillory has to die,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.059
and you're the one who has to choose.

37:41.060 --> 37:43.269
Is it gonna be the rocks and the dirt?

37:43.270 --> 37:45.779
Or is it gonna be the
people and the traditions

37:45.780 --> 37:49.409
and all of the things that
you can take with you?

37:49.410 --> 37:50.519
I got it!

37:50.520 --> 37:51.685
Oh, no.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.349
Aw, shit. I don't got it.

37:54.350 --> 37:56.440
Oh!

37:56.441 --> 37:57.525
Aah!

38:12.600 --> 38:15.039
Oh. Oh! Oh!

38:15.040 --> 38:17.879
It... it didn't explode. I-I did it.

38:17.880 --> 38:21.173
I chose wisely. I'm wise.

38:21.174 --> 38:23.999
All the people of Fillory...

38:24.000 --> 38:26.887
are going to fit into a seahorse?

38:26.888 --> 38:27.919
Mm-hmm.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.807
How do you know that was the one?

38:29.808 --> 38:31.759
Because that's how Ember and Umber

38:31.760 --> 38:33.629
first brought people to Fillory.

38:33.630 --> 38:35.289
They chartered the Great Seahorse

38:35.290 --> 38:36.814
to carry us in his pouch.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.059
Ah.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.979
What?

38:39.980 --> 38:42.359
How did people get to Earth?

38:42.360 --> 38:43.399
Uh...

38:43.400 --> 38:44.619
- The same.
- Well...

38:44.620 --> 38:45.782
- The same.
- Mm-hmm.

38:46.350 --> 38:48.909
And I promise I won't
have anything to do

38:48.910 --> 38:49.993
with robbing The Couple.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.246
If you give the book to Kady and Alice,

38:52.247 --> 38:54.874
I'll never see it again.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.540
Watching evil Marina
pretend to be good is...

38:58.879 --> 39:00.829
I feel like shit.

39:00.830 --> 39:03.610
Yeah, I feel like shit, too.

39:10.390 --> 39:13.579
Here. I'm glad to be rid of it.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.560
- Is that...
- The heist book?

39:15.562 --> 39:17.646
I know It doesn't look like much.

39:17.647 --> 39:21.066
Thank you. You guys...

39:21.067 --> 39:24.737
We have a lot of work to do... on us.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.969
But we're gonna try now that I'm better.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.576
Good.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.746
Okay, so I guess we're done here.

39:32.747 --> 39:36.169
And we won't bother you anymore.

39:36.170 --> 39:37.199
Yeah.

39:43.150 --> 39:46.299
Hey. I've been looking for you.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.480
I saw the Pig Man again.

39:50.290 --> 39:52.129
Turns out, you know that apocalypse

39:52.130 --> 39:54.308
I've been trying to stop?

39:54.309 --> 39:55.659
We cause it.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.519
If the prophecy says that
Fillory is destroyed,

39:58.520 --> 40:02.499
that means we succeed, right? I mean...

40:02.500 --> 40:04.520
- good news?
- Yeah.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.609
Good news.

40:06.610 --> 40:09.439
Look, about earlier,
I need to tell you...

40:09.440 --> 40:11.320
Look, I know. I was irresponsible.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.369
Look, I should just accept the fact

40:13.370 --> 40:16.939
that any control I had
over my life is now gone

40:16.940 --> 40:19.079
and I am a walking incubator.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.085
- Julia...
- It's just terrifying, you know?

40:21.086 --> 40:24.546
What if Lipson does the
test and it's bad news?

40:24.547 --> 40:26.507
You know, right now everything is good.

40:26.508 --> 40:28.559
And the thought of losing
any of that is just...

40:28.560 --> 40:33.260
Julia, it's not the baby
I'm freaking out about.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.579
Look, I told you about how my dad left,

40:35.580 --> 40:40.239
but what I didn't tell you...

40:40.240 --> 40:43.148
what I haven't told anyone is...

40:43.149 --> 40:46.379
around that time, my mom...

40:46.380 --> 40:48.600
started having episodes.

40:50.960 --> 40:54.419
Getting disoriented, hearing
shit that wasn't there.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.489
Um...

40:56.490 --> 40:58.679
the doctors thought it was just stress

40:58.680 --> 40:59.914
from my dad bailing on us, but...

40:59.916 --> 41:02.399
You think it's because of you.

41:06.570 --> 41:10.239
What's happening to you...

41:10.240 --> 41:13.160
looks just like what happened to my mom.

41:15.070 --> 41:17.349
And the episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.079
They got worse.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.024
When she burned down our apartment,

41:25.025 --> 41:28.528
it was the first time I got
thrown into foster care.

41:28.529 --> 41:33.400
She'd fight to get me back,
and then she'd get sick again.

41:35.452 --> 41:39.379
Eventually the state
took me in for good.

41:39.380 --> 41:41.620
And I was scared, but...

41:43.418 --> 41:46.629
I was more scared of my mom.

41:48.620 --> 41:50.989
I fucked her up for life.

41:54.560 --> 41:55.719
I'm so sorry.

41:55.720 --> 41:59.699
I don't want what happened
to her to happen to you.

41:59.700 --> 42:03.219
Okay. I get it.

42:03.220 --> 42:06.239
I'll do it...

42:06.240 --> 42:07.814
the scans, the treatments.

42:07.815 --> 42:09.519
But you have to know it won't be

42:09.520 --> 42:11.149
like what happened to your mom.

42:11.150 --> 42:13.572
We know about magic.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.950
We have ways to deal with it.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.559
And I won't put you in a cage.

42:27.830 --> 42:31.129
What the hell, man?

42:31.130 --> 42:34.630
I tried to talk to him, and
he punched me in the face.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.299
Who?

42:36.300 --> 42:37.597
No. Mm-mm.

42:40.110 --> 42:44.311
- I warned you not to cross me.
- How the hell did you get out?

42:44.312 --> 42:47.549
Let this be my last
lesson to you as dean.

42:47.550 --> 42:51.360
Don't make too many enemies.
They might find each other.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.259
The Couple.

42:55.320 --> 42:58.243
Oh, I can't let you take
that panel out of here.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.990
This is some "fate of the world" shit.

43:00.995 --> 43:04.123
Not my world, not my problem.

43:04.124 --> 43:06.125
Then I guess I'm your problem.

43:07.340 --> 43:09.669
Dean Fogg? What's going on?

43:09.670 --> 43:10.719
Ha!

43:10.720 --> 43:13.800
This just got very, very interesting.

43:14.740 --> 43:17.379
Are you stupid enough
to try and stop me?

43:34.260 --> 43:36.169
What just happened?

43:36.170 --> 43:38.269
The Couple just got the
last thing they need.

43:38.270 --> 43:40.899
They have the Seed,
the page, and the Panel.

43:40.900 --> 43:41.939
We got to tell the others.

43:41.940 --> 43:44.019
They need to steal that Seed now.
