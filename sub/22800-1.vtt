01:30.311 --> 01:33.778
Have I told you that
I like your shoulders?

01:33.803 --> 01:37.233
Thanks, they attach my arms to my torso.

01:37.258 --> 01:39.280
Yeah, they do.

01:57.373 --> 01:58.708
What are you doing?

01:58.733 --> 02:00.491
Nothing, I'm just...

02:01.045 --> 02:05.178
Wiping the walls?
- No, I was trying to set the mood

02:05.944 --> 02:07.655
by turning off the lights.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.577
No, no, no, you can't
turn off the lights,

02:11.602 --> 02:14.161
you gotta leave it on, I wanna see you.

02:14.186 --> 02:16.092
Why?
- Because I need...

02:16.117 --> 02:18.913
I need the full sensory experience.

02:21.969 --> 02:24.328
No, that's so dumb.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.675
No!

02:25.700 --> 02:28.399
Don't you wanna see the rest of my tattoo?

02:29.348 --> 02:30.880
The V-necks you wear
are all ready so low,

02:30.904 --> 02:33.715
I'm pretty sure I've seen the whole thing.

02:36.260 --> 02:38.877
I love when you sass me, Dolore.

02:39.555 --> 02:43.205
Please don't say my name
when we're fooling around.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.541
Why?
- Because it's the least sexiest

02:45.566 --> 02:47.697
pronoun in the world.

02:58.170 --> 02:59.741
I'm tired.

03:05.697 --> 03:07.241
You should go.

03:07.612 --> 03:11.123
I don't want you to fall asleep
at the wheel and die.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.967
It's cold out there.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.920
Put your clothes on first obvs.

03:22.512 --> 03:24.105
Can I stay here?

03:29.562 --> 03:31.707
That's a possibility.

03:33.855 --> 03:35.769
It would be nice.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.183
Don't you think?

03:42.677 --> 03:44.136
I don't know.

03:47.654 --> 03:50.237
I didn't really think about it.

03:55.311 --> 03:58.286
Don't send me out there in the cold.

03:58.860 --> 04:01.232
I feel so used and abused.

04:10.604 --> 04:11.752
Okay.

04:12.942 --> 04:14.135
Just...

04:15.909 --> 04:17.197
don't look!

04:32.460 --> 04:33.867
I thought you were tired.

04:33.892 --> 04:37.581
I am, but I need to
do something to unwind

04:37.606 --> 04:40.500
and it's either this or

04:41.140 --> 04:43.296
binge watch episodes of
The Mindy Project,

04:43.321 --> 04:46.187
and I thought this would be
quieter for you.

04:49.561 --> 04:50.894
So thoughtful.

07:06.608 --> 07:08.374
How long have you been up?

07:09.872 --> 07:11.390
Just a few minutes.

07:13.110 --> 07:15.827
I was looking forward
to waking up together.

07:17.953 --> 07:19.554
Morning breath.

07:22.205 --> 07:25.022
Morning breath is part of the experience.

07:34.313 --> 07:36.883
So what are you doing today?
- Just work.

07:36.908 --> 07:39.829
Then I'm gonna call Sinead and find out
what time her flight gets in.

07:39.854 --> 07:42.382
Oh yeah, she gets in tomorrow, right?

07:42.407 --> 07:44.047
I know, I can't wait.

07:44.987 --> 07:47.040
I can't wait to see her,
it's gonna be so exciting.

07:47.065 --> 07:48.813
I'm excited to meet her.

07:49.322 --> 07:52.046
I tried to creep her
on Facebook actually but,

07:52.579 --> 07:54.158
couldn't find her.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.399
Yeah, she's not on Facebook.

07:58.079 --> 08:00.313
Rebel.
- Yeah.

08:01.930 --> 08:03.582
Do you want any like milk or sugar?

08:03.607 --> 08:06.008
No no, tell me more about Sinead.

08:06.989 --> 08:11.099
She's like Ernest Hemingway
with a vagina.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.180
Nice, what else?

08:13.205 --> 08:15.868
She's like confident, and amazing,
and talented,

08:15.893 --> 08:18.954
and smart, resilient, and tough, and...

08:19.255 --> 08:22.806
She's like a total babe.
- I can't wait to meet her.

08:23.499 --> 08:25.947
Make sure you text me
about those dinner plans.

08:26.651 --> 08:30.353
Yeah.
- 'cause you know I'll forget.

08:30.936 --> 08:33.275
What about you, what are you doing today?

08:33.561 --> 08:37.158
You're meeting the ex, aren't you?
- Yeah, eventually.

08:39.277 --> 08:40.488
Where you guys going?

08:40.513 --> 08:44.284
We're going to...
we're going to the Storm Crow.

08:44.715 --> 08:46.511
I really like that place.

08:46.536 --> 08:49.035
I'm really glad that
you introduced me to it.

08:49.434 --> 08:52.043
Yeah, yeah, me too, I mean,

08:52.646 --> 08:55.449
it's one of her favorite places too so,

08:57.910 --> 08:59.450
since she's only in town
for a little while,

08:59.474 --> 09:01.277
I guess she wants to maximize her time.

09:01.302 --> 09:02.402
Yeah.

09:02.769 --> 09:04.738
Did you guys go there a lot?

09:04.763 --> 09:08.457
Yeah, a fair bit,
she knew one of the servers.

09:10.246 --> 09:12.941
Are you guys going for a food,
like dinner, or...

09:12.966 --> 09:15.136
No, no, I don't think so.

09:15.428 --> 09:19.096
I guess it's just drinks or couple beers,

09:19.121 --> 09:21.160
just something chill like that.

09:21.402 --> 09:24.791
That'll be good,
that'll be like cool, just...

09:24.816 --> 09:27.927
hanging out and having beers.

09:27.952 --> 09:32.318
It will be fine, it's just...
just to like mend fences and...

09:32.724 --> 09:35.880
maybe catch up a little bit or whatever,
but that's it.

09:36.507 --> 09:38.794
It's good though because...

09:39.865 --> 09:43.505
You know, I hate being on bad terms
with any of my exes.

09:46.010 --> 09:47.325
It's the worst.

10:15.754 --> 10:17.192
<i>You're all right.</i>

10:19.232 --> 10:21.614
<i>You got nothing to worry about.</i>

10:27.833 --> 10:29.356
<i>You're irreplaceable.</i>

10:44.498 --> 10:48.488
Hey, hey, thank you
so much for last night, I...

10:48.513 --> 10:50.365
for letting me stay and like...

10:51.162 --> 10:52.646
everything, I had such a good time.

10:52.671 --> 10:55.325
Yeah, it's fine, you
don't have to thank me.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.505
I also thought it was pretty great.

10:57.530 --> 10:59.661
I really like you, Dolore.

11:02.007 --> 11:03.107
Yeah?

11:04.248 --> 11:05.348
Yeah.

11:12.326 --> 11:13.446
Cool.

11:39.751 --> 11:43.111
Yeah, no, I know the form
you're talking about.

11:43.518 --> 11:45.743
Yep, you'd, both sides, yeah,

11:45.768 --> 11:47.759
and then sign it at the bottom.

11:47.784 --> 11:51.211
No, no, I'm not saying our
fax machine doesn't work,

11:51.212 --> 11:53.545
yep, we have a fax machine.

11:55.771 --> 12:00.349
Yes, I will call you and let
you know when we have it.

12:00.374 --> 12:02.810
You're welcome, bye.

12:55.238 --> 12:56.358
Honey.

12:57.763 --> 13:00.300
That's not gonna make you feel better.

13:01.326 --> 13:05.284
I am pathetic.
- Nothing about you is pathetic,

13:05.804 --> 13:07.855
you just got some bad habits.

13:08.714 --> 13:11.699
I just can't stop thinking about all these
horrible things that are happening.

13:11.723 --> 13:12.816
Listen...

13:12.855 --> 13:16.039
that scrawny white boy
wouldn't do anything

13:16.064 --> 13:20.433
to jeopardize his chances
at getting another taste.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.698
You feel me?

13:22.050 --> 13:24.425
You say that, but he's had
a lot of girlfriends.

13:24.450 --> 13:25.658
So?

13:25.683 --> 13:28.128
He'll be able to appreciate you more
in comparison.

13:28.153 --> 13:29.511
I'm not like you!

13:29.558 --> 13:32.363
People don't regret it
when they leave me.

13:32.388 --> 13:35.589
I also don't get to write a pop song
about it and rub it in their face.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.722
I'm sure you've broken
more hearts than you know.

13:41.114 --> 13:45.200
I didn't see... I didn't see it coming
the last time.

13:46.411 --> 13:47.559
Yeah well...

13:47.864 --> 13:50.098
I knew that one was trouble
the moment he walked in.

13:50.123 --> 13:52.567
Yeah, but you can't always
know it though, right?

13:52.592 --> 13:54.644
No, you can't.

13:56.278 --> 13:57.888
But it doesn't matter.

13:58.163 --> 14:01.442
No horrible thing could ever
bring you down!

14:01.802 --> 14:03.122
You're tough.

14:03.472 --> 14:05.255
Yeah?
- Yeah!

14:09.004 --> 14:10.754
Call your girlfriend.

14:13.662 --> 14:15.973
Hi.
- Hey, let me see your face.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.091
Hey (........)!

14:19.116 --> 14:20.380
What up, slut?

14:20.405 --> 14:22.184
I get to see you tomorrow!

14:22.209 --> 14:25.341
I know, I can't wait, I'm so excited.

14:25.366 --> 14:27.997
Do you need me to pick you up in the airport?
- Yes, please.

14:28.022 --> 14:29.473
And you are still packing.

14:29.498 --> 14:32.388
I'm almost finished packing, actually.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.644
Are you used to sleeping in airports yet?

14:34.669 --> 14:37.622
No, that is not my
favorite part of traveling.

14:37.647 --> 14:39.956
Well at least you have traveled,
I mean...

14:39.981 --> 14:40.995
you're so worldly.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.755
You know what, you will travel,
we will travel.

14:43.780 --> 14:44.645
I know, I know.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.864
I'm just... I guess I've just been
getting antsy 'cause

14:46.889 --> 14:48.425
I've worked in an office for a year,

14:48.450 --> 14:51.230
and you've been trotting
the globe like a horse

14:51.255 --> 14:52.934
with a freaking fire card.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.763
Well I have been giving
my fair share of rides.

14:57.194 --> 14:58.638
Giddy up.

15:00.266 --> 15:05.016
So... what's your...
last week been like?

15:06.109 --> 15:07.641
It's been okay.

15:07.666 --> 15:10.156
I've been a little nervous about leaving,

15:10.181 --> 15:12.412
you know, just like uprooting myself,
but...

15:12.437 --> 15:13.774
I'm just not letting it bother me.

15:13.798 --> 15:16.977
Makes sense, I mean,
leaving everyone behind,

15:17.002 --> 15:18.688
I'd be pretty crushed.

15:21.245 --> 15:24.480
Go to bed sweetie,
what are you even doing up?

15:24.505 --> 15:27.980
Hanging out, waiting to talk to
your babely self.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.151
And?

15:31.414 --> 15:34.781
I looked at some stuff on the internet
and made myself feel like crap.

15:34.806 --> 15:36.172
Dolore...

15:37.188 --> 15:38.586
are you okay?

15:40.539 --> 15:43.904
It's just gonna be really good
to have you back, Sinead.

15:43.929 --> 15:46.234
I have missed you so much, my love.

15:46.562 --> 15:50.613
I'm so glad that we're gonna be living
in the same city again!

16:01.762 --> 16:02.762
Hello!

16:10.872 --> 16:13.989
Yo, girl!
- You're here!

16:15.976 --> 16:17.818
I'm so excited, I was so scared
you were gonna

16:17.843 --> 16:19.358
get on a different flight at Pearson, that

16:19.382 --> 16:21.217
I called the passport
office and told them that

16:21.241 --> 16:24.538
you were their first one-way,
jihadess!!!

16:24.563 --> 16:26.093
That makes sense.

16:26.414 --> 16:29.914
I was wondering why they took my vibrator.

16:31.118 --> 16:33.991
Guess they didn't want me to
blow up a plane, fair enough.

16:34.016 --> 16:36.890
Then I kind of got my
attention caught by something

16:36.915 --> 16:40.468
right in the corner of my eye,
so I turned to see what it was

16:40.493 --> 16:43.858
and the guy next to me had his dick out.

16:43.883 --> 16:46.483
What?
- Yeah like, fully out on the bus,

16:46.508 --> 16:48.108
fucking masturbating.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.265
Honestly, I was like scared, like how
do you handle this kind of situation?

16:51.290 --> 16:52.647
I've never...

16:53.000 --> 16:55.163
been around this before.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.021
Like obviously looking back on it,

16:57.022 --> 16:59.819
I had nothing to worry about,
it wasn't like real danger,

16:59.844 --> 17:02.701
but it's really...
freaky.

17:02.726 --> 17:03.647
I mean, yeah.

17:03.672 --> 17:07.538
That was probably like the weirdest,
maybe even worst moment.

17:07.563 --> 17:10.265
Like that's the kind of stuff that would
like scar me for life.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.577
That's the kind of stuff
that just makes me so nervous

17:12.602 --> 17:14.265
about traveling, I don't wanna do it.

17:14.290 --> 17:17.723
Honestly, if I let
every weirdo and asshole

17:17.749 --> 17:20.419
scar me for life, my whole
body and soul would look

17:20.444 --> 17:22.185
like Seal's face.

17:22.637 --> 17:24.387
You just get over it.

17:31.220 --> 17:34.017
Well, what do you wanna
do now that you're back?

17:34.042 --> 17:38.572
Okay, I know this will probably
sound kind of crazy coming from me...

17:40.056 --> 17:42.314
but I feel like I might be ready to,

17:42.339 --> 17:44.901
like settle down and start my real life.

17:44.926 --> 17:46.340
Like get pregnant?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.736
No, no, not, no.

17:50.556 --> 17:54.556
I mean like get a steady
job and like save some money

17:54.581 --> 17:58.111
and maybe just do some volunteer work,
or read a book

17:58.136 --> 17:59.579
just because.

18:01.356 --> 18:03.689
Have like a real relationship,

18:04.447 --> 18:06.767
and... be a better friend.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.361
Okay, you're a great friend,

18:08.658 --> 18:10.369
but if you run on me again,

18:10.394 --> 18:12.291
I'm gonna hunt you down
and I'm gonna kill you.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.056
I'm gonna have you embalmed.
- Do what?

18:14.081 --> 18:16.409
So you can have me around forever.

18:16.434 --> 18:19.523
No, so I can like touch your
stupid face whenever I want.

18:19.548 --> 18:21.461
No, you cannot do that
to me while I'm driving,

18:21.486 --> 18:23.319
I almost hit that guy.

18:23.767 --> 18:26.033
Well speaking of relationships,

18:27.127 --> 18:30.057
now that you're back, do you think you're
gonna try and ignite an old flame?

18:30.081 --> 18:31.283
You know like...

18:31.846 --> 18:35.454
see what that friendly ghost is up to?
- Casper?

18:37.658 --> 18:39.970
I don't know. I mean I haven't
talked to him since I left,

18:39.995 --> 18:44.204
so I don't even know what
he's up to these days.

18:45.586 --> 18:48.486
You haven't talked to him at all, have you?
- No.

18:52.055 --> 18:55.320
I mean, I think it would
be nice to see him again,

18:55.716 --> 18:59.037
but I also think it
could be really awkward.

18:59.062 --> 19:03.234
I mean, there's just so
many unresolved feelings.

19:03.259 --> 19:05.164
Feelings?

19:05.189 --> 19:08.633
Would you believe that I
still stalk him online a bit,

19:08.658 --> 19:11.344
like a little bit, like...
once every two weeks.

19:11.369 --> 19:13.195
Of like all the wieners.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.922
I know, I know, of all the dicks,

19:16.523 --> 19:18.649
he's the one that got away.

19:22.031 --> 19:24.273
You know what, I cannot wait to get home,

19:24.298 --> 19:27.523
have a shower, get this plane off of me,

19:27.945 --> 19:30.929
and then we can start
talking about tonight.

19:30.954 --> 19:34.906
We're gonna like tear it up,
we're gonna like party and stuff.

19:34.931 --> 19:38.523
And am I gonna get to meet your new
piece of man meat tonight too?

19:38.548 --> 19:39.656
Yes.

19:40.515 --> 19:42.851
I am so excited.

19:49.444 --> 19:53.642
Sexy moves.
- Thanks, I've picked up a few.

19:54.991 --> 19:57.296
What about the food,
do you two want me watching it?

19:57.321 --> 19:59.435
Tonight is the casserole,
you put in the oven

19:59.460 --> 20:01.030
and it heats.

20:01.055 --> 20:02.187
Okay.

20:12.219 --> 20:13.541
Sounds like a dance party in here.

20:13.565 --> 20:16.680
Well hello studly do me right.
- Hello.

20:17.290 --> 20:19.837
Listen, I know how
much you love boxed wine

20:19.862 --> 20:22.149
but let me introduce you to...

20:22.174 --> 20:23.259
Bottled wine.

20:23.284 --> 20:25.048
Well hello.
- How fancy.

20:25.073 --> 20:26.532
Right?
- Come on.

20:31.428 --> 20:32.693
Sinead?

20:32.718 --> 20:36.819
Right, this is my best friend
in the whole entire world... Sinead!

20:37.569 --> 20:39.233
Hey, Riun.

20:39.494 --> 20:40.801
Sinead.

20:40.826 --> 20:45.881
She just got back from this crazy adventure
traveling to all these crazy places.

20:45.906 --> 20:48.975
She's amazing, she's super smart,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.725
and she's a total sexy man eater.

20:51.999 --> 20:55.520
Obvs!!!
- Obvs... for sure.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.606
Oh, he takes people
around Wisser on tours,

20:58.631 --> 21:00.092
and he makes really good sandwiches,

21:00.117 --> 21:02.092
and he has some pretty neat tattoos.

21:02.117 --> 21:03.365
I do.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.912
I'm gonna have to try
one of those sandwiches.

21:05.937 --> 21:07.748
You like Reuben's?

21:08.087 --> 21:09.178
Sure.

21:11.014 --> 21:12.959
This is so exciting
that you guys are actually

21:12.984 --> 21:15.631
in the same room together, oh my gosh!

21:16.780 --> 21:19.584
I have to go pee, but
you guys keep chatting

21:19.609 --> 21:22.280
and...
I'll be back.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.799
I'll get some glasses.
- Yeah.

21:28.979 --> 21:31.908
Hey, how's it going out there?

21:31.933 --> 21:33.299
Great!!!

21:33.324 --> 21:35.607
It's just really hard to
believe that people actually

21:35.608 --> 21:37.869
like me so to have them
in the same room together

21:37.894 --> 21:41.518
just really helps prove they're
not figments of my imagination.

21:45.295 --> 21:46.381
So.

21:47.209 --> 21:50.303
Where exactly were you traveling?

21:50.865 --> 21:54.240
Europe, Amsterdam,
Barcelona, a few places.

21:54.265 --> 21:58.412
Yeah... and you were studying at
Dalhousie before that, right?

21:58.437 --> 21:59.437
Yup.

22:00.745 --> 22:03.679
Cool, I've always
wanted to visit Halifax.

22:03.704 --> 22:06.743
You should it's...
it's got a really great music scene,

22:06.768 --> 22:07.857
lots of history.

22:07.882 --> 22:09.990
I will, I will.

22:13.133 --> 22:15.086
So, and you and... you and Dolore...

22:15.111 --> 22:17.498
you were, were you friends
before you went there or...?

22:17.523 --> 22:20.312
Yeah, we go way back, junior high.

22:21.976 --> 22:26.422
That's cool, that's really cool.
Your relationship's lasted so long,

22:26.721 --> 22:29.570
it's like, I mean, she talks
about you all the time.

22:30.055 --> 22:32.148
She has a lot to say about you too.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.640
Good things?

22:34.773 --> 22:38.328
I think she appreciates
your sense of humor.

22:39.834 --> 22:41.380
She's really funny.

22:42.046 --> 22:43.021
Yeah?

22:43.046 --> 22:45.279
I don't know, she makes me laugh a lot.

22:47.469 --> 22:48.969
I really like her.

22:52.081 --> 22:53.487
What about you?

22:53.747 --> 22:56.016
Traveling... what?

22:56.041 --> 22:59.477
Traveling... no, I mean not really,
I mean I just

22:59.502 --> 23:01.331
a couple road trips.

23:01.356 --> 23:03.752
Not to far, I could never really
afford to go very far.

23:03.777 --> 23:04.737
What about school?

23:04.762 --> 23:07.971
Did you do, like a tourism program
or something before

23:07.995 --> 23:09.065
getting this job?

23:09.090 --> 23:10.588
Nope.

23:11.175 --> 23:14.088
I went to UBC,
did some random stuff for a while...

23:14.588 --> 23:16.768
and then dropped out, and then

23:16.793 --> 23:19.088
actually got the job
through a friend of mine.

23:19.928 --> 23:21.245
You went to UBC?

23:21.270 --> 23:24.424
Yeah, I mean, yeah it
was like six years ago,

23:26.002 --> 23:27.835
didn't last very long.

23:32.314 --> 23:35.049
You didn't go to UBC, did you?

23:35.402 --> 23:37.494
Yeah, I mean, I started there,

23:37.519 --> 23:39.729
but I transferred to Dal, so.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.369
Okay, yeah, that might be it.

23:42.916 --> 23:44.299
What might be it?

23:47.239 --> 23:49.309
Did you know Luke Sudderbee?

23:50.746 --> 23:52.020
I did.

23:52.622 --> 23:55.889
I went to a few of his parties
in my first year.

23:57.351 --> 23:58.466
Yeah.

24:04.032 --> 24:05.884
You do look really familiar.

24:15.591 --> 24:16.809
We didn't...

24:17.864 --> 24:19.848
We did, we totally had sex.

24:19.873 --> 24:21.543
They seemed a little awkward.

24:21.568 --> 24:23.793
I mean, it's just really hard when people

24:23.818 --> 24:26.761
meet and you have to introduce them
and you've gotta start conversations,

24:26.786 --> 24:27.810
and be the facilitator.

24:27.835 --> 24:30.504
You're working yourself
up, just let it happen.

24:30.529 --> 24:32.615
I just, I don't know,
I hate being the center

24:32.640 --> 24:34.490
of attention, it's just way too stressful.

24:34.515 --> 24:37.091
Better get used to being
the center of attention,

24:37.116 --> 24:39.210
beautiful face like yours.

24:39.235 --> 24:42.247
I mean, I just, I can't
handle these group settings.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.474
I just think that...

24:43.499 --> 24:45.990
Honey, there's two people out there.

24:46.015 --> 24:48.599
Yeah well, that's a company, what is it?

24:48.624 --> 24:51.068
Three is a crowd, three is a crowd.

24:51.093 --> 24:52.247
Listen.

24:52.865 --> 24:55.198
They got one major thing in common...

24:55.536 --> 24:57.810
your sexy self.

24:58.904 --> 25:03.195
You just gotta unite them around
their mutual love for you.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.787
How many people did
you have to sleep with

25:04.811 --> 25:07.530
in order to not even recognize me?
- Your hair's all fucking curly now,

25:07.554 --> 25:09.810
You look totally different!
- You're not wearing my vagina beard

25:09.811 --> 25:12.341
and I can still recognize you eventually.

25:12.366 --> 25:13.490
Eventually, nice.

25:13.515 --> 25:16.341
Okay, how drunk were you?
- I don't know, I don't remember.

25:16.366 --> 25:19.800
I didn't have a fucking
breathalizer with me.

25:19.825 --> 25:22.568
This is really bad, this fucking,
fucking bad,

25:22.593 --> 25:24.427
this is so bad.
- All right.

25:25.318 --> 25:26.724
You know maybe...

25:26.967 --> 25:30.543
maybe it's not...
the most ideal circumstances,

25:30.568 --> 25:33.325
you know, but...
it was six years ago,

25:33.350 --> 25:36.654
and... and... and you...

25:36.670 --> 25:38.458
I don't even know your last name.

25:38.483 --> 25:41.129
And... I barely remember you.

25:41.154 --> 25:42.233
I don't think it's a big deal,

25:42.257 --> 25:45.279
I think... I think we should just
come clean right away.

25:45.304 --> 25:47.105
We should just tell her and just fucking,

25:47.130 --> 25:49.084
like just quick like a
bandage, just fucking rip it.

25:49.108 --> 25:51.582
This isn't gonna be like
a fucking bandage for her, okay?

25:51.607 --> 25:52.793
It's not gonna be a bandage!

25:52.818 --> 25:56.316
It's gonna be like ripping off a scab
and rubbing dog shit in the wound.

25:56.317 --> 25:57.419
It's...

25:57.662 --> 25:59.975
I just don't feel comfortable lying to her,
you know what I'm saying?

25:59.999 --> 26:02.050
I have known her for a very long time

26:02.075 --> 26:04.935
and knowing this would crush her.

26:05.302 --> 26:08.192
So if you actually care about
her like you say you do...

26:08.217 --> 26:10.622
you will not tell her!

26:12.478 --> 26:14.065
Okay, tell me right now.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.034
Are you absolutely certain,

26:18.394 --> 26:20.174
that she can't handle it?

26:21.744 --> 26:25.877
Riun... don't say anything.

26:29.408 --> 26:31.408
Time to dance bitches.

26:32.428 --> 26:34.034
Come on!

26:35.811 --> 26:39.092
Sinead, this one is for you.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.486
Come on!

26:58.332 --> 27:00.355
Is there something wrong
with the casserole?

27:00.380 --> 27:02.785
Nothing, I'm just
saving room for dessert.

27:02.810 --> 27:05.684
Sinead, I made you a casserole,
you expected me to make you dessert as well?

27:05.708 --> 27:08.111
We could go get gelato after, we could

27:08.136 --> 27:11.418
we can go to that 200 flavor
places, is that still open?

27:11.443 --> 27:13.129
Yeah, it's just...

27:13.154 --> 27:15.941
You don't wanna go there,
they've got ice crystals in their gelato.

27:15.966 --> 27:19.355
They also have crazy,
awesome, fun flavors.

27:19.380 --> 27:22.221
I had blue cheese once.

27:22.246 --> 27:25.332
Why, why would you do that to yourself?

27:25.357 --> 27:26.660
Riun, what about you?

27:26.685 --> 27:29.199
What's the weirdest
flavor you've ever had?

27:31.227 --> 27:33.035
I had wasabi once.

27:33.379 --> 27:36.340
It was awfu...
I regretted it.

27:37.652 --> 27:40.277
You guys are the king and
queen of poor choices.

27:40.302 --> 27:42.190
I do wanna do something
after dinner though,

27:42.215 --> 27:44.597
I wanna get reacquainted
with all my favorite spots.

27:44.622 --> 27:47.558
Well, Riun, we should show
Sinead around this week.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.285
Yeah, you should totally do that.

27:49.310 --> 27:52.238
I... I want you to come with us,
I want you to know my better half.

27:52.263 --> 27:54.113
Well yeah, but you...

27:54.137 --> 27:57.419
there's a lot of catching up to do and like,
I don't wanna intrude on best friend time.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.066
Riun, it's fine, actually you know,
you and I could,

28:00.091 --> 28:01.691
get to know one another.

28:04.439 --> 28:07.166
Yeah, Dolore, I...

28:09.425 --> 28:11.119
I'm getting old...

28:11.846 --> 28:13.080
you know?

28:13.096 --> 28:14.291
And so...

28:15.346 --> 28:16.705
with that,

28:18.392 --> 28:22.533
I... I... I just, I'm feeling like I
need to prioritize my time

28:22.558 --> 28:24.666
a little bit, you know?

28:24.691 --> 28:26.259
And my priority...

28:27.315 --> 28:30.377
what I want the most... is

28:30.791 --> 28:33.150
to get to know you better...

28:33.697 --> 28:35.231
just you...

28:37.228 --> 28:38.783
before anyone.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.330
And...

28:42.065 --> 28:45.064
you know, I just... I just wanna hang
out with just the two of us.

28:45.089 --> 28:46.756
For a bit, you know?

28:50.612 --> 28:51.886
You're a dork.

28:51.911 --> 28:54.558
You get to know me so much better
by seeing me with Sinead.

28:54.589 --> 28:56.214
Am I right?

28:56.749 --> 28:58.578
A little off the chain.

29:00.122 --> 29:04.534
Okay, yeah, I mean you're right,
you're right, you are.

29:05.300 --> 29:08.191
I mean, part of getting to know you
is getting to know...

29:08.464 --> 29:10.214
people that are important to you.

29:10.763 --> 29:11.909
So...

29:13.894 --> 29:16.761
all three of us will hang out.
- Great.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.816
I just...

29:19.519 --> 29:20.956
you know Sinead?

29:20.988 --> 29:23.276
You and Riun have something in common.

29:23.792 --> 29:26.464
You both think that I'm great.

29:26.823 --> 29:28.783
And I think that you guys are great,

29:28.784 --> 29:33.441
and I really hope that the two of you
think each other are great,

29:33.466 --> 29:36.558
and I wanna stop saying great.
- You do kind of sound like Tony the Tiger, so.

29:36.583 --> 29:39.128
What I'm trying to say is that...

29:40.581 --> 29:42.542
it's just really nice to have

29:42.567 --> 29:45.163
two of my most favorite people,

29:45.188 --> 29:48.526
over in my apartment for dinner.

29:48.558 --> 29:50.612
So... thank you.

29:50.637 --> 29:52.144
You're so wonderful, Dolore.

29:52.169 --> 29:54.620
Am I really one of your favorite people?

29:55.765 --> 29:57.395
You're one of my favorite people too.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.883
Oh, man, there's just so
much love at this table,

30:00.908 --> 30:03.316
it's like this is how threesomes start.

30:03.341 --> 30:07.830
No, I could never have a threesome with you
because you are too hot,

30:07.855 --> 30:11.042
and I would look like
Danny Devito next to you.

30:11.067 --> 30:13.628
Like a super sexy hot Danny Devito.

30:13.653 --> 30:16.605
In what universe is there
a sexy Danny Devito?

30:16.630 --> 30:18.276
You guys are both effing ridiculous,

30:18.301 --> 30:21.832
you, oh my god, you guys would
have the cutest children.

30:21.857 --> 30:22.926
Well I... I can't do this.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.895
What, like what?
- Riun, don't.

30:24.920 --> 30:29.160
What are you talking about?
Do you... do you have an STI?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.835
No, I don't have an STI.

30:33.913 --> 30:37.327
But I do have to tell
you something important.

30:38.766 --> 30:42.099
We... have to tell you something important.

30:45.617 --> 30:47.492
Even though it's important,

30:49.141 --> 30:50.874
it's not a big deal, okay?

30:51.837 --> 30:53.093
Okay.

30:54.875 --> 30:58.343
We didn't...
we didn't recognize each other at first,

31:00.332 --> 31:03.015
but Sinead and I have met before,

31:04.586 --> 31:05.890
at a party,

31:06.194 --> 31:08.361
like around six years ago.

31:09.445 --> 31:13.578
We were really, really drunk,

31:17.392 --> 31:19.883
and we had sex.

31:20.893 --> 31:23.813
And it was...
it was a one time thing, Dolore,

31:24.329 --> 31:27.436
and it was completely unmemorable,

31:27.741 --> 31:32.374
and... and I didn't have feelings
for her and I don't now,

31:32.399 --> 31:35.936
and I haven't seen or spoken to her since.

31:39.546 --> 31:42.655
I'm not telling you this to hurt you,

31:43.543 --> 31:45.507
not that it should hurt you,

31:46.351 --> 31:50.351
I'm telling you this because I respect you

31:51.030 --> 31:54.171
and... because I care about you.

31:57.202 --> 32:01.210
And... because you deserve the truth.

32:05.116 --> 32:07.803
And I never, ever wanna lie to you.

32:21.994 --> 32:27.080
I just need a few minutes
just to be by myself.

32:28.338 --> 32:29.885
Don't you want to talk about it?

32:29.910 --> 32:33.510
No, I just need a few minutes,
I'll be right back.

32:35.251 --> 32:36.307
Okay.

32:38.127 --> 32:40.901
If that's what you want,
we'll be right here waiting.

33:16.034 --> 33:17.339
It's all right...

33:19.394 --> 33:20.745
you're special...

33:22.577 --> 33:24.577
you're one in a million.

33:28.159 --> 33:29.316
Honey.

33:40.361 --> 33:41.697
Fuck, fuck!

33:43.047 --> 33:44.174
Fuck, fuck!

33:44.199 --> 33:46.198
I think that's what got us into trouble
in the first place.

33:46.222 --> 33:47.487
She always thought she couldn't trust me.

33:47.511 --> 33:48.604
She had her own reasons,

33:48.629 --> 33:51.338
it had nothing to do with you
for her to be, no.

33:51.908 --> 33:52.908
No.

33:53.612 --> 33:54.752
No, it's not her fault.

33:54.777 --> 33:56.339
Right, I get it,
you feel like an asshole,

33:56.363 --> 33:58.393
I feel like an asshole too.

33:58.418 --> 34:01.190
But it's because we care,
we didn't do anything wrong.

34:01.215 --> 34:03.908
I have, I have done things wrong.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.283
Not to her but...

34:08.416 --> 34:11.400
you're probably not the only girl
I can't remember.

34:14.962 --> 34:18.877
Sinead, I feel like an asshole
because I am an asshole.

34:22.376 --> 34:23.958
Listen, I get it.

34:24.257 --> 34:27.844
I've fucked around a lot too
and I've hurt people accidentally

34:27.869 --> 34:29.882
and I'm not proud of it,

34:29.908 --> 34:32.235
but I don't feel guilty about consequences

34:32.261 --> 34:36.244
that I couldn't expect,
and neither should you.

34:36.268 --> 34:40.213
Okay, you know her best,
tell me what to do.

34:40.237 --> 34:42.724
What do we do, how do we fix it?
- I don't know.

34:42.725 --> 34:44.963
Come on, what do we say to her?

34:44.987 --> 34:47.463
What does she need to hear?
- We can't change how she feels.

34:47.487 --> 34:49.880
But... bullshit, we just
gotta convince her that this...

34:49.905 --> 34:51.621
How we gonna convince her?

34:51.621 --> 34:54.746
She doesn't trust us
because we're the problem!

34:55.021 --> 34:57.146
What kind of friend are you?

34:57.532 --> 35:01.560
You're not even willing to try
to help her deal with this.

35:02.161 --> 35:06.560
I'm not gonna sit here and be lectured
by a pair of balls and dick!

35:07.679 --> 35:09.731
You know what, what do guys
even know about friendship?

35:09.732 --> 35:13.284
What do you do, you help them move,
you get a fucking beer!

35:14.910 --> 35:18.716
You have never wiped the
tears off your friends face.

35:18.741 --> 35:21.523
You never sat with them for three hours

35:21.548 --> 35:23.929
and they have panic attacks
and cried because

35:23.954 --> 35:25.992
the douche bag who cheated on them

35:26.017 --> 35:29.157
fucking posts a picture of him
with a new girlfriend.

35:29.688 --> 35:31.157
So fuck you!

35:39.654 --> 35:40.804
Dolore...

35:41.473 --> 35:43.395
Dolore, I'm so sorry.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.525
Dolore...

35:47.200 --> 35:48.708
you know I love you.

35:49.909 --> 35:52.667
And I am so sorry that this happened.

35:54.835 --> 35:57.355
Please don't let it change anything.

35:59.141 --> 36:00.652
It's okay.

36:01.222 --> 36:02.730
I'm okay.

36:04.882 --> 36:07.603
I know that it happened a long time ago

36:07.628 --> 36:11.241
and... that it was like a one time thing,

36:11.266 --> 36:16.874
and... I understand why you
didn't tell me right away.

36:16.899 --> 36:18.022
But...

36:18.374 --> 36:21.432
I just need some time to process this,

36:21.457 --> 36:23.913
so I just need you guys to leave.

36:48.850 --> 36:51.420
I really want us to talk about this.

36:52.052 --> 36:53.897
I don't want to right now.

37:17.295 --> 37:20.366
You know those get backed up?
- I know.

37:22.663 --> 37:24.444
Just deal with it later.

37:24.954 --> 37:27.358
Can't have them following me around.

37:27.599 --> 37:29.851
I know it hurts right now,

37:30.960 --> 37:32.960
but you don't have to do this.

37:33.678 --> 37:36.374
You can face this, you
can get through this.

37:36.399 --> 37:38.069
No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

37:38.094 --> 37:39.827
No, I can't!

37:51.636 --> 37:53.553
Can't all be Fierce.

39:40.765 --> 39:41.874
Hey.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.608
Riun, I told you I needed time,

39:48.633 --> 39:52.530
I really wish you hadn't come by.
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

39:53.738 --> 39:54.933
I'm sorry.

39:55.770 --> 39:57.637
I wanna give you your space,

39:58.386 --> 40:01.053
I'm just... I'm worried about you.

40:02.319 --> 40:04.316
And I really need to talk.

40:07.382 --> 40:10.840
Are you sure you're okay
because you don't seem okay?

40:16.267 --> 40:18.806
Are you really not gonna say anything?

40:21.140 --> 40:23.174
Are you just planning on
ignoring me for long enough

40:23.198 --> 40:25.166
that I give up and go away?

40:25.191 --> 40:27.009
I don't know what you mean.

40:28.066 --> 40:29.119
Look.

40:30.369 --> 40:31.611
I know...

40:32.424 --> 40:35.845
I know...
that this kind of thing

40:36.472 --> 40:38.127
really bothers you.

40:38.854 --> 40:41.121
I feel like I can guess as to why.

40:44.497 --> 40:45.841
All I can say...

40:46.326 --> 40:49.154
is that I'm sorry that you had
to deal with that because...

40:49.444 --> 40:51.318
you really don't deserve it.

40:52.623 --> 40:53.701
And...

40:54.318 --> 40:57.271
I'm sorry that my shit
gets in the way too, and...

40:57.296 --> 41:01.250
that my personal shit makes
the situation even worse, you know?

41:02.409 --> 41:04.409
I'm so sorry about that!

41:07.957 --> 41:10.425
But we have something really good,

41:11.272 --> 41:13.871
and I don't want you to throw it away.

41:14.502 --> 41:16.019
I wanna fight for it!

41:17.361 --> 41:20.925
I wanna do anything that
I can to hold on to it.

41:24.599 --> 41:26.474
I'm sorry Riun, but...

41:28.193 --> 41:30.060
I don't think that we
can hang out anymore.

41:30.085 --> 41:31.818
No, listen to me!

41:32.146 --> 41:36.497
Dolore please, just, just help me...

41:36.522 --> 41:38.576
help me understand you. Just...

41:38.865 --> 41:40.751
help me see why it's such a big deal

41:40.776 --> 41:44.756
that we can't get past it, that we...
that we can't just work on it.

41:47.775 --> 41:49.368
You know when we're...

41:50.205 --> 41:52.048
lying in our bed,

41:52.073 --> 41:56.314
or my bed, or whoever's bed,
and we're just kissing and cuddling,

41:56.939 --> 42:01.268
we're staring in each others eyes
and it's intimate and beautiful?

42:02.725 --> 42:04.204
In those moments...

42:05.158 --> 42:07.603
I am so scared of you.

42:08.491 --> 42:11.454
I am so scared that you're
just gonna open your mouth

42:11.479 --> 42:15.646
and say something that will
absolutely destroy me.

42:17.544 --> 42:21.003
And when you text me,
and when you call me,

42:21.028 --> 42:24.966
I panic because I just imagine opening it

42:24.991 --> 42:29.310
and seeing some horrible message,
or that you're just dumping me.

42:29.950 --> 42:32.183
And when you're not with me,
I imagine that you just

42:32.208 --> 42:35.120
don't even miss me,
you don't even miss me!

42:35.145 --> 42:39.802
And when we are together...
it's fake, it's not real!

42:41.294 --> 42:43.661
I just imagine you going out

42:43.686 --> 42:47.263
and finding someone
to replace me so easily.

42:47.614 --> 42:49.926
And now I can actually
visualize that person,

42:49.951 --> 42:52.240
and it's my best friend
in the whole entire world

42:52.265 --> 42:54.748
who's amazing and brilliant, who I love,

42:54.773 --> 42:59.334
but I have always felt this big
in comparison.

43:01.114 --> 43:03.373
And it's not your fault.

43:05.811 --> 43:07.738
It's not your fault.

43:11.537 --> 43:12.794
But this...

43:13.099 --> 43:16.989
is just too shitty, to constantly

43:17.426 --> 43:21.724
anticipate what you're gonna say
and what you're gonna do.

43:22.625 --> 43:27.266
I just want to enjoy a
moment like everybody else,

43:28.034 --> 43:29.539
but I don't.

43:32.165 --> 43:34.186
I'm sorry.
- Listen, Dolore.

43:34.211 --> 43:36.891
If I had met you before Sinead,

43:36.916 --> 43:38.461
before any other girl I've ever met,

43:38.486 --> 43:41.619
I would never have gone
looking for anyone else.

43:42.832 --> 43:46.999
And I am not...
any other person you've ever been with.

43:50.725 --> 43:51.889
I'm not!

43:53.849 --> 43:55.766
How can I convince you?

43:57.389 --> 43:58.842
You can't.

44:04.271 --> 44:05.505
Come on.

44:06.523 --> 44:09.232
Dolore listen, listen...

44:09.257 --> 44:11.701
I will never, ever hurt you.

44:12.302 --> 44:15.763
Okay listen to me, listen to me,
I love you, okay?

44:15.787 --> 44:16.982
Okay?

44:17.007 --> 44:19.005
I will never hurt you!

44:19.037 --> 44:20.905
Don't you believe me?

44:20.930 --> 44:22.966
No, I don't.

44:50.872 --> 44:52.269
How did it go?

44:52.294 --> 44:54.497
Well, I...

44:54.919 --> 44:56.986
called her out for ignoring me.

44:57.647 --> 44:59.685
Told her how I feel, I...

45:00.657 --> 45:03.294
told her we could work through this,

45:03.786 --> 45:05.669
That she trust me.

45:08.552 --> 45:10.304
Coffee, man.

45:10.329 --> 45:13.490
And did you guys wanna do some food?

45:13.514 --> 45:14.770
Think we're good.

45:15.097 --> 45:16.356
Okay.

45:21.669 --> 45:25.426
I told her that I loved her.
- Were you telling the truth?

45:25.820 --> 45:29.497
For the first time in my life,
it was actually true.

45:32.190 --> 45:35.697
For the first time in my life,
it wasn't very persuasive.

45:37.507 --> 45:40.658
I'm really sorry, Riun.
- It's okay.

45:41.486 --> 45:43.424
It just means it's your turn.

45:46.351 --> 45:47.565
Yeah.

45:49.362 --> 45:50.541
I know.

45:50.832 --> 45:53.674
Have you heard anything from her?
- No, nothing.

45:58.683 --> 46:01.496
You know, you just, you
can't tell her anything.

46:01.521 --> 46:03.493
It's like she just keeps
everything so deep in

46:03.518 --> 46:05.737
that big fucking heart of hers,
and it doesn't matter

46:05.762 --> 46:07.593
how many times you tell
her that you adore her,

46:07.594 --> 46:10.011
that I adore her, she just...

46:16.013 --> 46:18.114
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

46:21.808 --> 46:23.808
She's just so sensitive.

46:24.861 --> 46:26.208
She is.

46:30.111 --> 46:31.416
Sinead...

46:34.424 --> 46:36.557
I really don't wanna lose her.

46:37.817 --> 46:40.471
Yeah... neither do I.

46:45.062 --> 46:47.218
I suck at everything.

46:47.540 --> 46:49.203
That's the spirit.

46:49.594 --> 46:51.234
I'm gonna try again.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.283
All right.

47:06.208 --> 47:08.138
Sinead, I don't wanna see you right now.

47:08.163 --> 47:11.893
Dolore, I'm sorry, but we need to talk.
- I really can't.

47:15.927 --> 47:17.130
Is that a pool noodle?

47:17.155 --> 47:18.506
Yeah, I was babysitting
at my aunts house,

47:18.530 --> 47:21.239
and I thought it would come in handy.

47:23.864 --> 47:25.349
Hey, stop!

47:25.374 --> 47:26.888
Come on, okay, what's...

47:26.913 --> 47:29.857
a little carnal knowledge
between two best friends?

47:29.882 --> 47:31.071
Go away.

47:31.096 --> 47:35.263
Dolore, you can't just ignore me
and expect me to go away.

47:36.514 --> 47:38.950
All right, we're bajango sisters,

47:38.975 --> 47:43.044
so many girlfriends are, and you know,
it could actually be to our betterment.

47:43.069 --> 47:45.677
We can have a stronger
friendship because now

47:45.702 --> 47:47.989
we can swap stories about his balls.

47:48.014 --> 47:49.896
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

47:49.921 --> 47:52.240
You know you are completely overreacting.

47:52.265 --> 47:55.474
Yeah Sinead, my feelings
are completely illegitimate.

47:55.499 --> 47:56.723
Now go away!

47:56.724 --> 47:59.115
Don't be stupid, no one
said you're not entitled

47:59.140 --> 48:01.810
to be embarrassed or hurt,
or pissed off, okay?

48:01.835 --> 48:05.395
But you know that feeling
that way is irrational

48:05.420 --> 48:08.803
because it didn't mean anything,
what happened between me and Riun.

48:08.804 --> 48:11.701
It doesn't mean that what you
have with him isn't special,

48:11.726 --> 48:14.670
it doesn't mean that he prefers me to you,

48:14.695 --> 48:16.974
it doesn't mean that you can't trust him,

48:16.999 --> 48:20.396
and it doesn't mean
that I am better than you.

48:21.874 --> 48:22.968
Okay?

48:22.993 --> 48:26.368
It only means those things
if you decide it does.

48:26.765 --> 48:28.607
I should've known, Sinead.

48:28.632 --> 48:30.084
I should've known that you've fucked

48:30.109 --> 48:34.076
so many people that one day it would turn
out to be somebody important.

48:35.827 --> 48:36.827
Okay.

48:37.826 --> 48:39.646
You're angry at me, fine.

48:40.349 --> 48:41.459
But I'm gonna take you out,

48:41.484 --> 48:43.818
and we are actually going
to do something to fix this.

48:43.843 --> 48:45.287
I'm not going anywhere with you.

48:45.312 --> 48:46.362
Dolore...

48:46.560 --> 48:48.734
I am not gonna let you
destroy our friendship

48:48.759 --> 48:52.271
and wallow in your apartment
eating fucking Oreos.

48:52.296 --> 48:53.459
Yeah?

48:53.484 --> 48:57.170
What are you gonna do about it,
you curly haired munchkin?

49:00.575 --> 49:01.816
Get in the car!

49:01.841 --> 49:04.424
Get in the car, get in the car!

49:07.847 --> 49:09.147
Watching you!

49:09.504 --> 49:10.654
Stay put!

49:16.985 --> 49:18.898
Hey, don't! I swear to god,
if you

49:18.923 --> 49:21.188
touch that handle, I will rip out

49:21.228 --> 49:23.761
every hair on your pretty little head.

49:30.828 --> 49:34.244
I like this white girl...
she's got spunk.

49:53.059 --> 49:55.090
You shouldn't text and drive.

49:58.727 --> 50:00.457
Where are we even going?

50:02.607 --> 50:04.738
I'll tell you when we get there.

50:05.607 --> 50:07.832
It's not like it matters anyways.

50:09.325 --> 50:11.816
Can't you see how hard she's trying?

50:12.469 --> 50:14.496
Putting up with your attitude.

50:15.051 --> 50:16.988
All this is for you...

50:17.363 --> 50:18.871
for your friendship.

50:19.347 --> 50:21.924
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

50:26.719 --> 50:28.469
You know I'm frustrated with you

50:28.494 --> 50:30.375
for doing this to yourself...

50:30.399 --> 50:32.288
for being willing to throw away

50:32.313 --> 50:34.305
two good relationships in your life,

50:34.330 --> 50:36.821
over something so insignificant.

50:39.369 --> 50:41.049
But I'm really hurt...

50:42.096 --> 50:44.029
that you would do this to me.

50:45.363 --> 50:47.190
That you would consider...

50:48.127 --> 50:50.065
cutting me lose and...

50:50.370 --> 50:52.088
never seeing me again.

50:54.198 --> 50:56.315
Because you're my best friend...

50:57.067 --> 51:00.518
and I can't imagine anything worse
than losing you.

51:03.039 --> 51:06.015
And it sucks to know that
you don't feel the same way.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.959
No, no, no!

51:22.130 --> 51:24.051
Okay, we're here.

51:24.076 --> 51:25.731
Why are we here?
Why are...

51:25.756 --> 51:28.121
I don't even like this neighborhood,
this is dumb,

51:28.146 --> 51:30.732
I just wanna go home.
- Okay, okay!

51:30.757 --> 51:32.287
Okay, you know what?

51:33.006 --> 51:37.013
I'm gonna tell you something that I have
been keeping from you for a long time.

51:37.038 --> 51:38.802
Let me guess, you fucked my dad.

51:38.827 --> 51:42.994
Okay, can you just stop being
an asshole for one second?

51:45.492 --> 51:46.781
All right, so...

51:46.806 --> 51:51.031
remember the dick that got away,
my friendly ghost Casper?

51:51.056 --> 51:52.492
Yeah, okay.

51:52.810 --> 51:54.998
Okay, well while we were dating, there...

51:55.023 --> 51:58.334
was this one time that
he slept over at my house,

51:59.586 --> 52:02.281
hell, and in the night I woke up, and...

52:04.000 --> 52:06.711
I heard him say your name in his sleep.

52:07.432 --> 52:09.172
I know, it wrecked me.

52:09.586 --> 52:12.554
And I... I just, I liked him so much, and

52:12.579 --> 52:14.664
and, and I'd liked him more
than I had liked anyone

52:14.689 --> 52:17.804
in a really long time, and the
fact that he said your name

52:17.829 --> 52:22.289
just confirmed everything that I was
afraid of, that he was into you.

52:23.297 --> 52:24.953
And I just went kind of crazy,

52:24.978 --> 52:26.617
I just, I kept thinking about you guys.

52:26.642 --> 52:28.812
I kept thinking about
him leaving me for you,

52:28.837 --> 52:32.015
I kept thinking about,
about like you guys conspiring

52:32.040 --> 52:33.640
to fornicate behind my back,

52:33.665 --> 52:38.117
and I, it just, it just, it just overcame
me and I felt so pathetic,

52:38.142 --> 52:41.506
and it was constant, and
the worst part was that it

52:41.531 --> 52:45.273
wasn't safe to tell my best friend.

52:46.328 --> 52:49.422
Sinead, I don't know why you
would ever feel threatened by me.

52:49.447 --> 52:52.172
I know, it doesn't make sense...

52:52.749 --> 52:54.582
but that's how I felt.

52:56.156 --> 52:57.492
Dolore...

52:58.563 --> 53:01.172
you're not the only one who feels like

53:01.197 --> 53:04.851
they don't measure up to their
best friend all the time.

53:07.683 --> 53:11.792
Okay, so then why are you
telling me this here, at this bar?

53:13.122 --> 53:15.276
Because Casper is in this bar.

53:16.512 --> 53:20.634
And I think that in order for
us to get back on even ground,

53:20.659 --> 53:24.589
for you to feel like you got back
whatever you think I took from you,

53:24.855 --> 53:27.822
that you need to go in there
and hit that.

53:27.847 --> 53:29.089
What, no!

53:29.114 --> 53:32.011
Okay, well then just back on it then.
- No, Sinead, no, come on.

53:32.036 --> 53:33.728
I know that you are angry at me,

53:33.753 --> 53:35.917
you feel vulnerable, you want validation,

53:35.942 --> 53:37.986
and you wanna get back at Riun,

53:38.011 --> 53:39.784
so why don't we just

53:40.073 --> 53:43.284
kill all those birds
with one hot make out session?

53:43.309 --> 53:47.089
Sinead, I appreciate that
you're trying to fix things...

53:47.925 --> 53:50.784
but this, this is really stupid.

53:50.809 --> 53:53.533
I am not gonna have sex with
your long lost summer love Casper.

53:53.558 --> 53:56.589
Stupid, oh my god, do you
know what's good for you?

53:56.614 --> 53:59.112
Not always.
- Are you willing to do...

53:59.137 --> 54:01.486
anything else to try
to save our friendship?

54:01.511 --> 54:02.884
No.
- All right.

54:02.909 --> 54:04.814
Well I'm not willing to just sit around
and do nothing,

54:04.815 --> 54:06.456
so until you come up with your

54:06.481 --> 54:08.526
grown up, responsible plan,

54:08.551 --> 54:10.850
we're gonna do my stupid plan!

54:11.259 --> 54:15.378
So why don't you get in
there and get that sweet D.

54:16.276 --> 54:19.496
<i>But I don't wanna have to
buy you drinks every time...</i>

54:19.497 --> 54:21.020
<i>every time something
good happens at work.</i>

54:21.044 --> 54:22.651
<i>But I want you though.</i>

54:26.489 --> 54:27.990
<i>I work at G Nelson.</i>

54:28.343 --> 54:30.260
<i>It stands out, right.</i>

54:32.615 --> 54:36.435
Dolore, hello.
- Oh, hey Casper.

54:36.912 --> 54:38.607
Fancy seeing you here.

54:38.632 --> 54:41.404
I haven't seen you in ages.
Where have you been hiding?

54:41.429 --> 54:43.575
Oh, you know, around.

54:43.600 --> 54:44.866
Well it's good seeing you again.

54:44.890 --> 54:47.466
Hey, what are you doing,
are you here with anyone?

54:47.491 --> 54:49.325
No, you know, I just...

54:50.099 --> 54:52.107
came here to have a drink all by myself.

54:52.132 --> 54:53.507
You can drink with us if you want, yeah?

54:53.508 --> 54:54.786
Yeah, cool, definitely.

54:54.811 --> 54:56.990
We're cel...
celebrating Cameron's new job.

54:57.015 --> 54:58.708
Congrats.
- I got a new job.

54:58.733 --> 54:59.677
It's a big deal.

54:59.702 --> 55:02.879
Sorry, where are my manners?
Cameron, Dolore.

55:02.904 --> 55:05.419
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

55:06.091 --> 55:08.136
So what are you drinking?
- A beer...

55:08.161 --> 55:11.091
but maybe you could buy me another one.

55:11.372 --> 55:14.615
You should probably finish
that one first though, right?

55:14.984 --> 55:16.592
Good advice.

55:26.614 --> 55:27.825
Casper?

55:29.021 --> 55:32.833
What have you been doing lately,
other than working out?

55:33.293 --> 55:36.599
Well, I'm getting my degree
this year, completing that.

55:36.624 --> 55:40.005
I took a year off to do
some volunteering in Haiti.

55:40.030 --> 55:44.146
Wow, that is so interesting
and very upstanding of you.

55:44.171 --> 55:45.763
Thank you, it's just...

55:46.536 --> 55:50.489
honestly it's just really,
really meaningful work.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.021
What were you studying?

55:52.046 --> 55:53.989
I'm getting a degree in urban planning.

55:54.014 --> 55:57.255
UBC actually has one of the most larger
programs in the world.

55:57.280 --> 56:00.606
Holly wow, that must have been
really tough to get through.

56:00.631 --> 56:03.968
I enjoy the challenge, I find I excel

56:03.993 --> 56:06.263
in those kind of environments, so.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.285
So that's what you've
been doing lately, Casper?

56:11.558 --> 56:14.363
That's what I've been
doing lately, Dolore.

56:16.794 --> 56:20.863
So who have you been
doing lately, Casper?

56:20.888 --> 56:21.800
I'm sorry...

56:21.825 --> 56:24.675
I'm just curious, because you know,
a little munchkin

56:24.700 --> 56:25.793
told me a secret.

56:25.818 --> 56:27.175
Yeah, what was that?

56:27.200 --> 56:29.127
That you used to have a crush on me.

56:29.152 --> 56:30.221
Is that so?

56:30.246 --> 56:32.925
Yeah, don't be shy about
it, I think it's pretty neat.

56:32.950 --> 56:36.566
Who said I was shy, I'm not
even saying that it's true.

56:36.591 --> 56:38.707
I think it's great if it were true,

56:38.732 --> 56:40.320
because I think that you're great,

56:40.345 --> 56:44.844
and you're pretty well
dressed, and great overall.

56:44.869 --> 56:45.964
I dress myself.

56:45.989 --> 56:48.433
Do you undress yourself?

56:48.458 --> 56:51.765
Okay excuse me, what are you doing?

56:51.790 --> 56:54.019
Seducing you, obvs.

56:54.044 --> 56:55.839
Dolore, I'm gonna be honest,

56:55.864 --> 56:58.425
I find it really unattractive when girls...

56:58.450 --> 57:00.660
Casper, what the hell is wrong with you?

57:00.685 --> 57:03.550
She's practically giving it away,
why don't you wanna hit that?

57:03.575 --> 57:05.425
Dolore, what's going on here?

57:06.296 --> 57:08.144
I'm sorry, do I know you?

57:08.474 --> 57:10.441
Are you freaking serious?

57:11.503 --> 57:13.800
We dated for four months.

57:14.230 --> 57:15.628
Sinead!

57:15.653 --> 57:18.691
I'm sorry, look, I didn't recognize you
with the curly hair.

57:18.716 --> 57:21.082
Oh my god, do I really look that different
with curly hair?

57:21.107 --> 57:22.899
No, you look terrific.

57:23.337 --> 57:25.348
Okay Sinead, what's going on here.
Did you set this up?

57:25.372 --> 57:27.262
We spent every other day together
for four months,

57:27.286 --> 57:30.144
I would remember you if you had
Renee Zellweger's plastic surgeon.

57:30.169 --> 57:32.237
Look, I don't know what
you want me to say, and I...

57:32.262 --> 57:35.043
still wanna know why your friend
is trying to get into my pants.

57:35.068 --> 57:36.434
Wait a minute.

57:38.301 --> 57:43.161
Did you not recognize me,
or did you not remember me?

57:44.250 --> 57:47.098
Look, it took me a
second to recognize you

57:47.123 --> 57:49.856
'cause it's been a long time.
- Oh my God!

57:50.969 --> 57:52.176
All right Sinead look,

57:52.201 --> 57:54.918
I didn't remember you,
it took me a half second.

57:54.943 --> 57:56.862
Please don't take it personally,
it's just...

57:56.887 --> 57:58.893
it's been a really long time.
I mean...

57:58.918 --> 58:01.847
a lot has happened, a lot has changed
since you and I were together,

58:01.872 --> 58:05.097
and I'm sorry, you just haven't been
on the forefront of my mind lately.

58:05.769 --> 58:07.012
But...

58:09.965 --> 58:11.122
What?

58:14.141 --> 58:17.173
Casper... I still think about you.

58:20.382 --> 58:21.649
That's okay.

58:25.112 --> 58:26.353
Sinead...

58:26.743 --> 58:28.485
look, I remember you...

58:28.509 --> 58:31.970
and I remember you fondly,
we had a great time together.

58:31.995 --> 58:35.165
But...
in the end it was just four months,

58:35.190 --> 58:38.267
what 2/5 of the decade ago.

58:38.292 --> 58:41.212
I mean, I'm sorry...
- Just stop!

58:41.620 --> 58:42.657
Fuck.

58:46.706 --> 58:48.580
Way to ruin Cameron's night.

58:49.164 --> 58:52.331
Sinead!
- That hasn't been proven yet, has it?

58:59.681 --> 59:00.799
Sinead?

59:03.521 --> 59:06.549
I'm just so embarrassed.
- No, don't be.

59:08.874 --> 59:12.260
I'm sorry, this was supposed to be
about you and I just...

59:12.285 --> 59:14.010
Don't worry about it.

59:15.516 --> 59:18.603
I just feel so stupid.

59:20.405 --> 59:22.002
You are amazing...

59:22.486 --> 59:25.353
and extraordinary in a million ways,

59:25.378 --> 59:29.002
and I've cherished every moment
we have ever had.

59:30.026 --> 59:31.377
Thanks, Dolore.

59:32.186 --> 59:35.869
Any guy who doesn't see that,
doesn't deserve to be with you.

59:36.947 --> 59:38.854
Yeah, I know.

59:43.626 --> 59:45.008
I'll be okay.

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:06.363
Fuck it... let's go get some gelato.

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:14.245
What?
- I'm sitting outside a bar crying.

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:17.608
I feel like I'm 19, and I
wanna go get some gelato.

01:00:19.273 --> 01:00:20.960
I don't understand.

01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:27.413
I don't understand how yo...

01:00:29.546 --> 01:00:32.601
how you can just pull
yourself together and...

01:00:33.312 --> 01:00:37.046
get up and leave after going
through something like that.

01:00:39.945 --> 01:00:42.023
I'm not stronger than you.

01:00:42.467 --> 01:00:45.788
I don't have anything that you don't have.

01:00:45.813 --> 01:00:47.624
It sure seems like you do.

01:00:49.077 --> 01:00:50.968
I just don't let other people
make me feel small

01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:52.937
because I know that I'm not.

01:01:01.136 --> 01:01:05.206
Dolore, do you know why this thing
with Riun upsets you so much?

01:01:05.632 --> 01:01:09.518
Why you were ready to throw away
our friendship over it?

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.392
It's not because someone else
doesn't think that you're special,

01:01:14.417 --> 01:01:16.339
doesn't think that you're lovable.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:21.362
It's because you don't think you are.

01:01:24.339 --> 01:01:27.901
And it breaks my heart, because I...

01:01:27.926 --> 01:01:30.792
I wanna show you, and I wanna tell you.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.540
But...

01:01:35.644 --> 01:01:38.044
you need to believe it for yourself.

01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:50.292
It's okay.

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:55.839
I still love that big, huge heart...

01:02:58.084 --> 01:02:59.886
even though it's sensitive.

01:03:02.725 --> 01:03:04.545
Show you around this week?

01:03:07.319 --> 01:03:08.834
That would be nice.

01:03:12.761 --> 01:03:14.527
You wanna do a brunch?

01:03:17.381 --> 01:03:18.781
Oh my god!

01:03:19.082 --> 01:03:22.082
I would love to do brunch,
I just love brunch.

01:03:22.107 --> 01:03:24.832
Like I could definitely do
brunch, it's my favorite.

01:03:25.649 --> 01:03:26.917
Okay.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.550
It's a date.

01:03:29.738 --> 01:03:31.167
Bye.

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:00.334
If you're looking for a strong...

01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:01.759
confident...

01:04:02.249 --> 01:04:03.827
fearless woman?

01:04:05.346 --> 01:04:09.413
Enough staring at that poster and
start looking in the mirror.

01:04:13.753 --> 01:04:16.496
I really wish I could
see myself that way.

01:04:19.168 --> 01:04:21.168
You know I wasn't born Fierce.

01:04:22.419 --> 01:04:25.230
I chose to define myself that way.

01:04:26.228 --> 01:04:30.300
I decide who I am each and every day.

01:04:32.304 --> 01:04:34.374
Don't let yourself be defeated.

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:37.328
You can choose to...

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:41.390
you can be fierce.

01:04:49.197 --> 01:04:50.916
I am fierce?

01:05:03.731 --> 01:05:07.124
I tried to make out with someone tonight,
I didn't want to though.

01:05:07.959 --> 01:05:09.209
It's okay.

01:05:09.968 --> 01:05:12.874
I figured you and Sinead
would be up to something crazy.

01:05:13.229 --> 01:05:14.279
I...

01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:17.866
I came by to tell you that I also

01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:20.757
wanna do whatever it takes
to hang onto you.

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:23.664
And like...

01:05:23.973 --> 01:05:25.496
well, literally because

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:28.637
you're a great hugger
and you're really tall, and

01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:32.006
but also like less literally.

01:05:36.167 --> 01:05:39.434
I just don't think this
is gonna be easy for me,

01:05:40.347 --> 01:05:44.080
and I really can't imagine it
being any easier for you.

01:05:44.449 --> 01:05:46.849
I'm gonna need a lot of reassurance...

01:05:47.634 --> 01:05:49.378
a lot of honesty...

01:05:50.331 --> 01:05:51.481
and...

01:05:52.495 --> 01:05:54.581
I'm gonna be unreasonable...

01:05:54.606 --> 01:05:58.870
like really unreasonable...
- Dolore it's... not a burden for me.

01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:03.620
I'm always gonna be here
to look out for you.

01:06:04.613 --> 01:06:06.636
I really care about you.

01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:11.268
I just don't think I can say
I love you...

01:06:11.503 --> 01:06:13.542
back... right now,

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:15.784
but I think that I can.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.214
Is that okay?

01:06:19.448 --> 01:06:21.893
I don't need you to love me right away.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.839
I do need you to trust me.

01:06:31.652 --> 01:06:35.323
I... I can't promise not to be scared...

01:06:37.675 --> 01:06:40.542
but I do promise to be courageous.

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:54.404
How you doin' over there?

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:02.771
I love you.

01:07:07.129 --> 01:07:09.130
You are so beautiful.

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:14.756
And you're really funny.

01:07:18.047 --> 01:07:20.849
You're completely cool, you know that?

01:07:25.565 --> 01:07:27.533
Baby, I don't know.
