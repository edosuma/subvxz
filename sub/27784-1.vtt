00:48.148 --> 00:50.116
<i>Winters didn't feel this cold...</i>

00:51.684 --> 00:53.413
<i>... when I was a child.</i>

00:59.492 --> 01:02.950
<i>It's almost two weeks since
I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.</i>

01:05.331 --> 01:09.791
<i>Now that I think of it,
I've lead such an unremarkable life.</i>

01:24.451 --> 01:25.816
Please, this way!

01:28.588 --> 01:29.947
Coming in!

01:40.733 --> 01:43.463
My condolences!

01:45.205 --> 01:47.435
We are here to assist you with encoffining.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.601
May I light up the incense?

01:50.910 --> 01:52.468
Yes.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.269
Thank you for coming!

02:22.408 --> 02:24.069
Looks like she's still alive.

02:26.379 --> 02:28.074
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.

02:28.381 --> 02:29.678
How can you tell?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.410
The body is undamaged.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.651
This is what happens when someone

02:34.652 --> 02:36.617
is discovered immediately
after death in a cold car.

02:40.126 --> 02:41.725
What a waste, she's beautiful.

02:45.565 --> 02:46.361
Do you want to try?

02:51.704 --> 02:52.568
Yes.

02:55.608 --> 02:59.832
For the deceased's peaceful departure,

03:00.079 --> 03:02.570
I will now commence
the rite of encoffinment.

03:03.082 --> 03:05.550
Everyone, please see her off from up close.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.238
I will now begin the cleansing.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.067
It has the thing.

05:45.745 --> 05:46.837
What thing?

05:46.979 --> 05:48.071
The thing.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.304
What thing?

05:50.450 --> 05:51.542
You know, the thing...

06:37.096 --> 06:39.291
Err... May I have a word with you?

06:39.432 --> 06:40.899
Yes, what is it?

06:41.434 --> 06:43.334
After the cleansing,

06:43.503 --> 06:46.131
we apply makeup on the deceased...

06:47.707 --> 06:51.040
We have different makeups
for male and female...

06:51.177 --> 06:53.407
Oh... please wait.

06:53.546 --> 06:54.308
Yes.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.780
Sis, which makeup
do you want for Tomeo?

06:59.051 --> 07:01.417
Men's or girl's?

07:03.055 --> 07:05.148
Come on, which one?

07:05.358 --> 07:08.987
If I gave birth to
a girl from the start,

07:09.362 --> 07:12.331
this would've never happened.

07:13.666 --> 07:14.963
But thanks to someone's seed...

07:19.739 --> 07:21.673
Girl's is fine then?

07:21.974 --> 07:22.531
Yep.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.175
Female's, please!

07:25.378 --> 07:26.640
Yes.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.523
Tomeo...

07:50.405 --> 07:55.405
O K U R I B I T O

07:55.406 --> 08:00.405
D E P A R T U R E S

09:51.090 --> 09:55.083
Not many in the audience again today.

09:55.227 --> 09:58.424
Yeah, they should put
more effort into advertising.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.493
I know.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.664
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.098
My wife is a web designer.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.431
I'll make her do it for free.

10:06.572 --> 10:07.834
What do you think?

10:08.374 --> 10:11.104
More importantly,
are you going to be fine?

10:11.243 --> 10:12.540
About what?

10:12.712 --> 10:13.806
Next, the next.

10:13.813 --> 10:14.711
Next what?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.047
You spent so much money on that.
Got to start looking for the next one.

10:19.318 --> 10:22.845
Good performance again, everyone!

10:22.989 --> 10:24.684
Good work everyone!

10:24.991 --> 10:27.152
Although the seats were empty...

10:27.326 --> 10:29.658
I think your performances were great.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.027
Um... actually...

10:36.535 --> 10:38.298
... today...

10:39.639 --> 10:42.972
... the owner of this orchestra,
Mr. Sonezaki...

10:43.109 --> 10:45.373
... has something to tell you.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.478
So, please give him your attention!

11:00.760 --> 11:02.957
You're...

11:03.360 --> 11:04.857
... disbanded!

11:12.805 --> 11:13.772
See ya!

11:17.877 --> 11:20.903
<i>I finally became
an orchestra member.</i>

11:21.313 --> 11:25.249
<i>But it became
a past memory in a flash.</i>

11:27.219 --> 11:29.414
<i>This cello is innocent.</i>

11:30.923 --> 11:33.289
<i>Only because it was bought
by a loser like me,</i>

11:33.659 --> 11:35.889
<i>it lost its job.</i>

11:37.296 --> 11:38.593
<i>In many ways...</i>

11:39.131 --> 11:42.430
<i>this cello was too heavy for me.</i>

11:45.805 --> 11:47.272
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

11:47.406 --> 11:48.600
<i>Please cook it immediately.</i>

11:48.774 --> 11:49.502
<i>Yes.</i>

11:49.642 --> 11:50.734
<i>Good bye!</i>

11:53.079 --> 11:54.137
I'm home!

11:54.313 --> 11:55.245
Welcome back!

11:55.481 --> 11:57.278
She gave me an octopus.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.952
I just happened to see our neighbor.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.385
They just caught it this morning.

12:08.594 --> 12:09.925
What's wrong?

12:12.631 --> 12:14.121
Disbanded.

12:15.334 --> 12:16.460
What is?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.699
My orchestra.

12:25.377 --> 12:26.639
I see...

12:28.314 --> 12:30.339
You just have to find the next one.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.680
There won't be a next one.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.991
Someone with my skill level
can only go so far...

12:42.161 --> 12:43.921
and there's the debt for this cello.

12:47.399 --> 12:48.366
How much?

12:55.708 --> 12:58.472
Don't worry, if it's just
around 10,000 yen,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.943
I can pay it back with my job.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.373
180,000 yen.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.842
1... 180,000 yen?

13:05.918 --> 13:08.011
Pros all spend that much...

13:08.187 --> 13:10.178
It's relatively cheap.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.690
Why did you hide it from me?

13:17.696 --> 13:20.324
I knew you'd be against it.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.303
Why didn't you tell me

13:25.838 --> 13:27.863
about something so important?

13:31.210 --> 13:32.199
I'm sorry.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.844
I'll make dinner.

13:49.728 --> 13:53.095
<i>"All the cities around the world
are our new homes.</i>

13:53.866 --> 13:57.063
<i>Let's live together
on a musical tour."</i>

13:57.570 --> 14:01.438
<i>Those were the words
of my marriage proposal.</i>

14:02.808 --> 14:05.174
<i>But the reality is harsh.</i>

14:05.711 --> 14:11.279
<i>No, I should've realized
the limit to my talent a lot sooner.</i>

14:17.957 --> 14:18.787
What happened?

14:20.826 --> 14:22.555
This octopus is alive!

14:23.295 --> 14:25.229
You're right. It's alive.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.361
Hey, Dai...

14:28.234 --> 14:29.258
what should we do?

14:33.404 --> 14:35.169
Don't get caught again.

14:43.849 --> 14:45.147
Huh?

15:11.877 --> 15:13.310
I think I'll quit.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.882
Quit what?

15:18.384 --> 15:19.316
Cello.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.951
What will you do then?

15:27.426 --> 15:30.190
Go back to the countryside...
in Yamagata.

15:36.468 --> 15:37.862
I vote yes!

15:39.305 --> 15:40.135
Huh?

15:40.906 --> 15:41.930
You don't mind?

15:43.442 --> 15:46.673
Well, the house your mom left you...

15:46.812 --> 15:48.507
we don't need to pay rent, right?

15:48.647 --> 15:49.978
But you really don't mind?

15:51.216 --> 15:52.148
Yes.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.052
This is a wonderful instrument.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.492
<i>I thought it was the greatest
turning point of my life,</i>

16:05.097 --> 16:09.333
<i>but for some reason, I felt relieved
the instant I let go of the cello.</i>

16:10.736 --> 16:12.795
<i>As if I was suddenly released</i>

16:13.238 --> 16:15.706
<i>from being tied up.</i>

16:17.176 --> 16:19.667
<i>What I believed to be my dream...</i>

16:20.479 --> 16:23.539
<i>was probably not my real dream.</i>

16:36.662 --> 16:39.391
<i>The only thing my mother left me,</i>

16:39.865 --> 16:42.197
<i>when she died two years ago.</i>

16:44.269 --> 16:48.706
<i>I've been told my father
ran the cafe at first,</i>

16:49.708 --> 16:51.938
<i>but I have almost no recollection of it.</i>

16:53.479 --> 16:56.213
<i>After he left home for another woman,</i>

16:57.282 --> 17:00.480
<i>my mother ran this small cafe,</i>

17:01.286 --> 17:04.281
<i>and raised me alone.</i>

17:06.125 --> 17:07.990
Meal's ready.

17:09.595 --> 17:10.857
Okay.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.935
I thought you would hate
the countryside more.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.939
No, it's kind of refreshing.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.175
I don't know if it's because of the water
here, but the rice tastes better too.

17:27.311 --> 17:28.279
Really?

17:29.815 --> 17:33.273
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.

17:33.452 --> 17:34.716
What will you sell?

17:40.993 --> 17:41.823
This is it!

17:43.162 --> 17:44.162
This, this one!

17:44.362 --> 17:46.589
No age limit, high salary?

17:46.832 --> 17:48.663
In addition, short actual working time?

17:49.635 --> 17:50.659
As a full-time employee!

17:50.836 --> 17:53.737
"NK Agent"? What kind of company is that?

17:54.206 --> 17:56.606
"A job that helps out journeys."

17:57.042 --> 17:58.270
A travel agency?

17:58.510 --> 18:00.444
Oh, maybe tour guide?

18:02.214 --> 18:03.943
It says "no experience necessary".

18:04.083 --> 18:05.641
I'll go ask for details.

18:06.018 --> 18:06.985
Yeah.

18:29.737 --> 18:31.306
This is it.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.216
Excuse me.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.387
Is this "NK Agent"?

18:47.626 --> 18:48.456
Yes...

18:49.161 --> 18:51.459
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.825
Oh, you're here for the interview!

18:54.967 --> 18:57.265
The boss will be back soon, sit here.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.070
Yes, thank you.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.273
I...

19:13.952 --> 19:16.978
was against it when the boss wanted
to post the ad in the newspaper.

19:18.257 --> 19:19.350
Oh...

19:19.358 --> 19:21.719
It's extremely hard to attract
people into this industry.

19:22.227 --> 19:26.095
Um... what does this company do?

19:27.366 --> 19:30.096
What? You came without knowing anything?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.428
It said to help out with journeys...

19:37.743 --> 19:39.938
Uh... that's not what you do?

19:48.420 --> 19:51.287
Boss, he's here for the interview.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.783
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.

19:55.494 --> 19:56.825
Oh, it's you.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.757
You seem more energetic than on the phone.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.127
Thank you.

20:02.501 --> 20:05.299
See? It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.

20:05.437 --> 20:06.165
Yes.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.870
I brought my resume just in case.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.272
Okay, sit down.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.504
Thank you.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.147
Can you put in lots of hours here?

20:25.290 --> 20:27.053
Huh? Uh... yes.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.056
You're hired.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.588
Eh?
What's your name again?

20:29.728 --> 20:31.161
It's Kobayashi Daigo.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.593
Order his business cards right away.

20:32.965 --> 20:33.761
Got it.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.095
W... wait...

20:36.235 --> 20:39.102
We haven't discussed anything...
salaries and other things...

20:39.238 --> 20:40.330
Oh, right.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.431
Let's start with one hand.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.334
"One hand"?

20:48.280 --> 20:49.611
50,000 yen?

20:49.982 --> 20:51.214
500,000 yen.

20:51.617 --> 20:52.779
500,000 yen?!

20:53.452 --> 20:54.477
Too little?

20:54.486 --> 20:56.181
Not at all, I can get that much?

20:56.321 --> 20:58.016
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.

20:58.156 --> 21:01.057
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?

21:02.561 --> 21:04.461
Let's see...

21:05.230 --> 21:09.599
As my assistant at first.

21:10.469 --> 21:11.800
Exactly what...?

21:12.738 --> 21:13.864
To be exact...

21:15.007 --> 21:15.905
... encoffining.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.534
Encoffining?

21:18.076 --> 21:20.874
A job that places the corpse
into the coffin.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.277
It's starting to bloom!

21:24.516 --> 21:27.576
Corpse as in dead people?

21:29.988 --> 21:32.081
You ask funny questions.

21:34.693 --> 21:38.959
No, uh, um...

21:39.097 --> 21:42.157
The job posting said helping out journeys.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.759
I assumed it was a travel agency...

21:46.038 --> 21:47.266
Oh, this is a misprint.

21:47.439 --> 21:48.406
Misprint?

21:48.874 --> 21:52.037
Not "helping out journeys", it's...

21:54.313 --> 21:56.178
"Helping out peaceful departure".

21:56.315 --> 21:57.482
Departure?

21:58.650 --> 22:03.113
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).

22:05.457 --> 22:09.450
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.721
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.461
This is for today.

22:15.834 --> 22:16.698
No, I can't...

22:16.835 --> 22:17.767
Don't worry!

22:17.903 --> 22:19.165
No...

22:39.558 --> 22:40.683
I'm back.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.651
Welcome back.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.623
Here.

22:45.664 --> 22:46.688
Where did you get this?

22:46.832 --> 22:49.523
You said you wanted to
eat sukiyaki from here, right?

22:51.002 --> 22:52.401
Yonezawa-beef?

22:52.571 --> 22:53.538
The highest-grade sirloin.

22:53.672 --> 22:56.334
Wow! Was it expensive?

22:56.708 --> 22:58.569
I got paid in advance.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.577
You got the job?

23:01.012 --> 23:02.138
Kind of, yes.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.644
Great! Let's celebrate today.

23:04.783 --> 23:05.807
Sure.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.642
So, what kind of job was it?

23:08.353 --> 23:09.445
Tour guide after all?

23:09.488 --> 23:10.647
Not really...

23:11.556 --> 23:12.488
Sales?

23:15.627 --> 23:17.185
What's the matter?

23:19.097 --> 23:20.997
It wasn't a travel agency.

23:21.366 --> 23:22.765
Oh? What was it?

23:24.770 --> 23:26.631
Ceremonial event-related...

23:26.705 --> 23:28.434
Like a wedding hall?

23:28.573 --> 23:29.732
Yeah.

23:29.775 --> 23:33.074
They might make you play the cello again!

23:35.380 --> 23:37.348
<i>I'll make sukiyaki right away.</i>

23:38.383 --> 23:39.281
Okay.

23:40.285 --> 23:44.244
<i>This is great! Looks tasty.</i>

23:53.732 --> 23:56.929
I don't think I'll come back that late.

24:00.939 --> 24:01.701
Get going!

24:01.840 --> 24:02.704
Bye!

24:29.501 --> 24:30.399
Morning!

24:31.470 --> 24:32.903
Hello!

24:34.105 --> 24:36.437
Use the boss' table until
the new one arrives.

24:42.681 --> 24:44.444
Your business cards are ready.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.682
No misprints.

25:06.304 --> 25:08.033
Are these that uncommon?

25:09.074 --> 25:10.701
This is my first time seeing a real one.

25:10.876 --> 25:11.810
First time?

25:11.812 --> 25:12.738
Yes.

25:12.911 --> 25:16.074
My grandparents passed away
before I'd grown up,

25:16.214 --> 25:18.614
and my mother passed away
while I was abroad.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.574
She was already in her grave
when I got back.

25:20.685 --> 25:21.943
What about your father?

25:22.020 --> 25:24.784
He left home for another woman
when I was 6.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.953
Your mother must have been lonely.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.165
But...

25:44.743 --> 25:47.477
I wonder if someone like me who has
never even seen a dead body before...

25:47.612 --> 25:49.307
can really do this job?

25:49.447 --> 25:51.244
You'll get used to it!

25:53.451 --> 25:55.851
To dead bodies?

25:56.121 --> 25:56.849
Yeah.

25:58.189 --> 26:00.350
The weather is nice lately,
so we're not very busy...

26:01.259 --> 26:03.489
but change of season...

26:04.296 --> 26:05.160
Do you need help?

26:06.898 --> 26:08.593
...will be very busy for us.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.032
Where does work come from?

26:11.202 --> 26:12.330
Funeral homes.

26:13.939 --> 26:14.928
Funeral homes?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.673
Yes. Encoffining...

26:17.809 --> 26:20.175
used to be done by family members.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.145
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes,

26:23.715 --> 26:27.173
then companies like ours appeared.

26:27.786 --> 26:31.449
In short, it's a super-niche industry.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.720
It's pretty heavy.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.955
There are many kinds of coffins.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.128
50000, 100000, 300000 yen.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.032
They differ by that much?

26:42.267 --> 26:47.136
The left one is plywood, the next one has
metal fittings and carvings on both sides.

26:47.572 --> 26:50.302
And the most expensive
one is solid cypress wood.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.843
Oh, the difference is in
material and decoration.

26:53.979 --> 26:56.777
Yes, they all burn the same way.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.576
Same ashes.

26:58.917 --> 27:02.216
The last shopping of your life
is done by others.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.387
Kind of ironic.

27:03.521 --> 27:04.317
Right.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.890
<i>Yes, this is NK Agent.</i>

27:12.297 --> 27:14.060
<i>Yes, he's here.</i>

27:15.433 --> 27:17.162
Yes, Minato Theater?

27:17.836 --> 27:19.929
Immediately? Okay.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.704
Is that the boss?

27:22.841 --> 27:23.830
A job.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.570
A job?

28:12.090 --> 28:13.387
Are you from NK?

28:13.692 --> 28:14.659
Yes.

28:14.893 --> 28:15.655
He's here.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.456
Oh, there he is.

28:23.401 --> 28:26.802
He's a newcomer to our company...

28:26.820 --> 28:27.730
Kobayashi.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.673
His name is Kobayashi,
the model for today.

28:29.841 --> 28:30.739
Good luck everyone!

28:31.076 --> 28:31.838
Model?

28:34.612 --> 28:37.775
We're going to film right
after you finish changing.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.110
Thank you for your cooperation.

28:39.250 --> 28:42.151
Get changed and makeup over there.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.248
Makeup?

28:43.588 --> 28:44.384
Yes.

28:46.524 --> 28:47.491
Boss...

28:48.059 --> 28:50.050
Don't worry. Go ahead.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.355
Okay.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.530
ENCOFFINING MANUAL

29:00.472 --> 29:02.667
First apply cotton
stuffing and cleansing...

29:02.874 --> 29:06.366
Followed by...

29:06.778 --> 29:08.769
The model is coming out!

29:19.991 --> 29:21.390
Not bad.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.020
Um... who's going to see this video?

29:25.163 --> 29:26.596
Don't worry,

29:26.998 --> 29:31.435
it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.469
In encoffining,

29:39.778 --> 29:44.306
we first perform cotton
stuffing and cleansing.

29:45.083 --> 29:51.113
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of
this world's fatigue, pain, and lust...

29:51.422 --> 29:56.950
and also symbolizes the
first bath for a new birth.

29:59.631 --> 30:03.567
Traditionally, a washtub
was used for cleansing,

30:03.868 --> 30:06.564
but for sanitary reasons,

30:06.871 --> 30:10.432
nowadays, we use sterilized cloths...

30:11.976 --> 30:13.165
to wipe...

30:16.781 --> 30:18.339
the body.

30:22.187 --> 30:25.953
Clothing ritual is performed to
maintain the dignity of the deceased.

30:26.191 --> 30:30.150
Making sure the deceased's skin
cannot be seen by the relatives...

30:30.295 --> 30:33.287
we perform it with utmost care.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.599
After the preparation,

30:44.909 --> 30:48.538
we shave the face before applying makeup.

30:48.980 --> 30:54.782
Males in particular experience
shrinking of muscle and dry skin,

30:55.320 --> 30:57.948
it seems as if they have a long mustache,

30:58.923 --> 31:01.653
so we shave them thoroughly.

31:05.563 --> 31:09.587
The skin of the dead gets damaged
easier than you might think.

31:09.901 --> 31:13.832
Sometimes the skin
peels off just by touch.

31:15.673 --> 31:16.640
Therefore,

31:18.943 --> 31:23.039
we perform it with caution and care...

31:23.915 --> 31:24.910
Ow!

31:24.916 --> 31:25.778
What the...

31:25.850 --> 31:26.848
Ow, ow!!

31:27.085 --> 31:28.074
Uh, oh.

31:28.286 --> 31:31.986
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!

31:35.927 --> 31:37.019
Uh, oh...

31:38.529 --> 31:40.997
Ow, ow!

31:41.232 --> 31:42.995
Don't worry, don't worry.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.529
It's not so bad.

31:50.708 --> 31:51.470
Welcome home.

31:51.609 --> 31:52.541
I'm home.

32:00.318 --> 32:01.212
What is it?

32:02.120 --> 32:03.787
What happened to your face?

32:05.456 --> 32:07.947
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.

32:08.793 --> 32:11.023
You were shaving at work?

32:11.663 --> 32:12.527
Yeah.

32:13.164 --> 32:16.065
You only use electric shavers at home...

32:16.935 --> 32:19.699
I had no choice.
The boss ordered me to do it.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.903
Don't worry, it's not so bad.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.536
Weird company.

32:25.009 --> 32:25.998
No kidding.

32:26.144 --> 32:26.906
Weird...

32:27.078 --> 32:27.908
Weird company.

32:35.853 --> 32:39.152
<i>The first job came without a warning.</i>

32:43.027 --> 32:44.221
Um...

32:45.096 --> 32:47.257
what should I do?

32:49.434 --> 32:50.332
For today...

32:52.804 --> 32:54.669
you just have to watch.

32:55.039 --> 32:56.768
Okay.

32:57.442 --> 32:59.239
But man...

33:00.945 --> 33:02.776
we hit a bad one.

33:03.214 --> 33:06.342
Huh? What do you mean?

33:06.784 --> 33:07.910
Never mind.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.481
Well, you'll see.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.681
Don't scare me like that!

33:22.900 --> 33:24.265
Thank you for waiting.

33:24.402 --> 33:25.960
Thanks for coming.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.361
Where is the body?

33:28.806 --> 33:32.367
An old lady living by herself...
dead for two weeks.

33:32.977 --> 33:35.537
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful!

33:36.047 --> 33:36.945
See you later.

33:40.985 --> 33:41.974
Who is he?

33:43.321 --> 33:46.688
From the funeral home.
Our employer.

33:49.227 --> 33:51.957
Let's get started.

33:57.668 --> 33:58.635
It stinks!

34:00.938 --> 34:02.362
Ugh.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.588
This way.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.322
Eh?

34:32.402 --> 34:33.699
Help out a little.

34:34.205 --> 34:35.399
Yes.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.585
Hold her feet.

34:56.661 --> 34:57.486
Her feet!

34:58.963 --> 34:59.822
Yes.

35:06.637 --> 35:08.935
You said I only have to watch...

35:09.240 --> 35:11.640
Slowly... gently...

35:16.114 --> 35:17.046
Come on, hold them!

35:18.149 --> 35:18.979
Yes.

35:32.096 --> 35:34.724
Wait, wait...

35:51.716 --> 35:53.240
You can go home for today.

35:58.623 --> 36:02.320
It was a bit too intense
for the first job.

36:21.279 --> 36:25.113
Really? Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!

36:35.193 --> 36:37.457
Hey, did you eat something weird?

36:37.628 --> 36:38.356
No.

36:38.496 --> 36:39.793
Something smells.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.022
Must be your scarf!

36:41.165 --> 36:42.860
No way!

36:49.874 --> 36:52.138
That guy wearing black, he smells!

37:02.587 --> 37:06.956
Ah! It's still here!

37:26.577 --> 37:27.544
Leave it over there.

37:28.879 --> 37:29.743
Yes.

37:33.684 --> 37:34.708
300 yen.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.476
Okay. Thanks!

37:37.021 --> 37:38.318
Towels for 100 yen.

37:38.689 --> 37:39.746
Okay.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.421
<i>You can get a lot of money
for this place right now.</i>

38:19.330 --> 38:21.628
I refuse to quit.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.596
Leave already.

38:24.235 --> 38:26.135
I just want the best for you.

38:26.270 --> 38:28.704
You talk just like a civil servant!

38:29.006 --> 38:31.969
I'm not so old that you
need to worry about me!

38:32.243 --> 38:34.370
Right? Shiori?

38:34.912 --> 38:37.904
Can I come for the big bath again?

38:38.082 --> 38:39.811
Yes, of course!

38:39.950 --> 38:41.542
For you,

38:41.686 --> 38:45.713
grandma will work hard!

38:46.757 --> 38:47.883
Daigo...

38:48.526 --> 38:49.458
Yamashita.

38:49.927 --> 38:52.760
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!

38:52.930 --> 38:55.626
Sorry, I've been busy.

38:56.867 --> 39:01.827
Oh! You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.

39:02.206 --> 39:03.696
Yes, it's been a long time.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.834
It sure has been!

39:08.346 --> 39:11.804
I hear you have an amazing job!

39:12.183 --> 39:14.413
Huh? Well... yes...

39:15.386 --> 39:17.513
What is that instrument called?

39:17.655 --> 39:19.850
Cello, that monster-sized violin.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.958
Right, cello!

39:22.326 --> 39:24.624
He's a great man.

39:24.795 --> 39:27.992
He plays an instrument
called cello in Tokyo!

39:28.132 --> 39:29.326
Wow!

39:33.037 --> 39:36.768
If only my son was as talented as he is!

39:36.974 --> 39:38.464
Mom...

39:39.243 --> 39:42.212
Sorry, we're having a little
argument here. Next time...

39:42.346 --> 39:43.313
Sure, next time.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.141
Bring your wife here next time.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.181
You're married, right?

39:47.318 --> 39:48.114
Yes.

39:48.252 --> 39:50.550
This place is very peaceful
without this fool.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.919
Which fool gave birth to this fool?

39:53.057 --> 39:56.026
Anyway, I have no intention
of selling this place!

39:56.160 --> 39:59.129
Oh, I got it!

39:59.597 --> 40:00.722
Did you figure it out?

40:00.765 --> 40:04.031
Yes, I finally figured it out.

40:32.963 --> 40:33.987
Something happen at work?

40:35.099 --> 40:35.929
No.

40:37.968 --> 40:38.832
Let's eat!

40:38.969 --> 40:39.993
Yeah.

40:40.404 --> 40:42.099
Let's eat...

40:44.275 --> 40:47.210
Our neighbor gave it to me.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.201
Oh.

40:48.245 --> 40:51.139
It was just slaughtered this morning,
so it's really fresh!

40:51.282 --> 40:53.273
She said we can even eat it raw!

41:04.560 --> 41:06.427
Maybe we should wait a little longer.

41:11.836 --> 41:12.928
Hey...

41:15.473 --> 41:16.531
Are you ok?

41:24.281 --> 41:25.771
Are you alright?

41:34.291 --> 41:35.553
What's wrong?

41:51.108 --> 41:52.268
What's wrong?

42:10.361 --> 42:12.761
Dai, you're acting strange...

42:19.169 --> 42:22.263
Hey, come on, Dai...

42:23.474 --> 42:26.807
Hey, you're embarrassing me.

42:27.411 --> 42:29.936
Not here...

42:36.420 --> 42:37.478
Dai?

42:46.997 --> 42:48.328
Hey, wait...

42:48.933 --> 42:49.900
Mika...

42:52.770 --> 42:53.702
Mika...

43:13.357 --> 43:15.224
<i>What exactly...</i>

43:16.594 --> 43:19.155
<i>am I being tested for?</i>

43:21.532 --> 43:25.062
<i>Is this my punishment for
not seeing my mother off?</i>

43:26.470 --> 43:29.004
<i>What will happen to me?</i>

43:33.477 --> 43:39.074
<i>Strangely, thinking about it
made me want to play the cello.</i>

43:40.718 --> 43:46.281
<i>I simply wanted to play the
cello while reminiscing my past.</i>

43:46.991 --> 43:50.119
It's so small...

48:34.878 --> 48:36.243
Salmons?

48:37.514 --> 48:39.175
Ah, yes.

48:43.453 --> 48:47.651
They're right by the rocks...
over there.

48:48.525 --> 48:52.291
Oh! Go for it!

48:58.468 --> 49:01.569
It's kind of sad...
to climb only to die.

49:03.540 --> 49:06.500
Why work so hard if you're
going to die anyway?

49:08.879 --> 49:11.109
I'm sure they want to go back...

49:12.582 --> 49:14.415
to their birthplace.

49:48.685 --> 49:51.449
Let's go for lunch. Lunch.

49:56.426 --> 49:57.916
It's an order from your boss.

50:02.199 --> 50:03.831
Is this a coincidence?

50:04.101 --> 50:04.824
Huh?

50:05.035 --> 50:07.030
That you happened to pass through here.

50:10.640 --> 50:12.034
It's fate.

50:12.709 --> 50:14.274
There's no such thing...

50:16.680 --> 50:19.911
This is your god-given job.

50:22.719 --> 50:24.346
Don't be ridiculous!

50:34.531 --> 50:38.490
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.

50:46.743 --> 50:48.267
They're angry!

50:50.047 --> 50:51.571
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!

50:51.715 --> 50:52.704
Sorry.

50:54.951 --> 50:56.043
You're late.

50:57.854 --> 50:59.219
It's 5 minutes past already!

50:59.356 --> 51:00.618
I apologize.

51:00.924 --> 51:04.289
You people make a living from the dead.

51:04.327 --> 51:05.316
Brother...

51:06.063 --> 51:07.121
Hurry up, damn it.

51:10.333 --> 51:12.324
I sincerely apologize.

54:20.390 --> 54:23.751
Is there a lipstick
your wife liked to use?

54:29.766 --> 54:30.596
What?

54:47.917 --> 54:50.210
<i>To revive a cold body,</i>

54:51.354 --> 54:53.349
<i>and grant eternal beauty.</i>

54:54.724 --> 54:59.684
<i>It was calm and precise.</i>

55:00.563 --> 55:03.395
<i>And more than anything,
it was filled with affection.</i>

55:05.635 --> 55:09.593
<i>To be present at the last farewell,
and send off the deceased.</i>

55:10.807 --> 55:16.939
<i>It was tranquil, and every
action seemed elegant.</i>

55:25.121 --> 55:26.611
Thank you very much.

55:35.498 --> 55:38.331
Please allow me to close the lid.

55:54.617 --> 55:55.948
Naomi...

56:14.971 --> 56:16.268
Naomi...

56:35.892 --> 56:36.859
Excuse me...

56:39.729 --> 56:42.789
I'm sorry about earlier today.

56:42.932 --> 56:45.127
No, it's our fault.

56:46.336 --> 56:49.203
Please take these.

56:50.273 --> 56:51.638
Thank you.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.743
That was...

56:55.945 --> 57:00.209
the most beautiful she's ever been.

57:02.085 --> 57:05.020
Thank you so much.

57:45.562 --> 57:46.551
It's nothing.

58:20.930 --> 58:22.454
Welcome.

58:25.168 --> 58:26.328
Good evening.

58:28.171 --> 58:29.331
Good evening.

58:31.140 --> 58:34.041
Ah! Don't tell me...

58:34.177 --> 58:36.111
Yes, she's my wife.

58:36.779 --> 58:38.406
Wow!

58:38.548 --> 58:39.845
Nice to meet you.

58:41.017 --> 58:43.076
You've caught a pretty one!

58:43.219 --> 58:45.449
It's not a big deal!

58:47.724 --> 58:51.319
Take your time and warm up.

58:51.528 --> 58:54.122
Yes, thank you.

58:58.067 --> 58:59.193
Good evening.

59:02.572 --> 59:04.164
Oh, hello.

59:06.309 --> 59:07.435
Do you always come here?

59:07.577 --> 59:10.740
I've been coming here
for more than 50 years.

59:10.880 --> 59:15.943
Oh! Maybe I've seen you before...

59:18.054 --> 59:20.784
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.

59:20.990 --> 59:24.517
They use groundwater heated by firewood.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.359
The water feels soft.

59:28.197 --> 59:31.655
That's why it doesn't sting
even though it's hot.

59:32.502 --> 59:33.969
I see.

59:34.370 --> 59:37.464
It's the best bath house in Japan!

59:37.607 --> 59:38.335
Right.

59:44.747 --> 59:46.612
See you again, Tsuyako.

59:47.116 --> 59:49.243
Thank you, come again.

59:54.557 --> 59:56.149
Would you like me to help?

59:56.693 --> 01:00:00.026
It's bad karma to get
help from the customer!

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.999
You do everything by yourself?

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:15.905
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.444
My son who works at a government office

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:21.183
tells me I should sell this place,
so they can build a condo here...

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.547
but my current customers would be in a fix.

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:26.919
As long as I'm still healthy...

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:29.787
Come on, you're still young.

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.390
Give him your support.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:33.954
What?

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:38.863
Dai is too kind.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:42.367
He keeps everything to himself.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.206
When his parents split up too...

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.706
He never cried in front of his mother.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:54.310
He cried when he was alone in the bath.

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:59.885
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:06.317
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:09.954
Yes.

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:17.738
How's the water today?

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.303
Hmm... so-so.

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:22.843
Oh, shush!

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:25.410
That's great. It looks good on you.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.513
It's all white!

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:38.260
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:39.656
Thanks.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.623
Hey, wanna go for a drink?

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.859
Oh, right! I know a nice bar.

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:47.663
Really? Let's go!

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:48.935
(With dialect) "Let's go".

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:49.968
Let's go?

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.731
Let's go.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:52.898
Let's go!

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.486
It's good!

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.991
It's been a long time since
we've drunk together like this.

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:19.466
It's like a scene from an enka
(traditional Japanese song).

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.377
Your mother listened to
this kind of music?

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.741
They must all be my father's.

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.880
Oh, right.

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:43.553
It started out as your father's cafe.

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.455
I don't even want to think about him.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:50.065
Actually, I don't even remember his face.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.834
Don't you want to see him?

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.064
Nope.

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:03.841
But... if I did...

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.536
If you met him?

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.740
I'd knock him out.

01:03:52.294 --> 01:03:54.121
It's my father's favorite.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.606
I think...

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:16.270
your mom loved your dad the whole time.

01:04:20.787 --> 01:04:22.447
No way.

01:04:23.258 --> 01:04:26.391
Otherwise she would've
thrown out all the records.

01:04:28.697 --> 01:04:31.257
She wouldn't have sorted them.

01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:01.291
Yes?

01:05:02.397 --> 01:05:04.092
<i>I want you to go right away.</i>

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.428
What? Now?

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:10.334
<i>Yes, someone hung himself in
the Star Hotel by the station.</i>

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.803
What about the boss?

01:05:13.942 --> 01:05:18.276
<i>He just left for another client.</i>

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:21.276
<i>Please go by yourself today.
Okay?</i>

01:05:22.317 --> 01:05:24.285
Okay.

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:09.898
Have a good day!

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.158
Thanks!

01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:31.415
Good morning!

01:06:31.553 --> 01:06:34.044
Good morning! Thanks for last night!

01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:39.683
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.762
I gave it everything I've got.

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.229
I see.

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:47.595
It's really cold today.

01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:48.766
Yeah.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.834
Here.

01:06:52.874 --> 01:06:54.466
Thank you!

01:06:54.609 --> 01:06:56.873
Bloodshot eyes! Didn't get any sleep?

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.071
This job is mentally draining.

01:07:06.755 --> 01:07:09.724
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:13.758
Thanks for the tea.

01:07:14.262 --> 01:07:18.062
A lot happened when I was young.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.600
I couldn't stay over there...

01:07:21.136 --> 01:07:21.966
Where?

01:07:22.537 --> 01:07:23.697
Hokkaido.

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:28.909
None of my past jobs lasted.

01:07:29.811 --> 01:07:32.974
I just happened to end up
in a cafe in this town.

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:39.518
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage...

01:07:40.355 --> 01:07:42.084
and died all of a sudden!

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:47.892
Then, our boss came...

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:54.591
That was when I witnessed
encoffining for the first time.

01:07:55.637 --> 01:07:59.403
Made me think...

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:02.535
when I die, I want this person to do it for me.

01:08:03.478 --> 01:08:08.472
He's completely different from others.

01:08:11.753 --> 01:08:13.846
That's how I ended up here.

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:20.183
Fate plays funny tricks on people.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.962
Never know what'll happen.

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:26.466
You're right.

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.127
Tastes great.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.841
Hey, Yamashita.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.108
Is he a friend of yours?

01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:45.076
Good afternoon!

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:45.777
Good afternoon!

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.548
You don't have to greet him.

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:49.724
Honey...

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:52.220
Go on. I'll catch up.

01:09:00.068 --> 01:09:01.996
There's a rumor going around.

01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:03.667
About what?

01:09:06.006 --> 01:09:09.807
It's none of my business,
but find a proper job!

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.883
Let's go! Come!

01:09:31.765 --> 01:09:32.993
I'm home.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:45.176
Mika?

01:09:51.786 --> 01:09:52.752
Mika...

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:57.883
What's wrong?

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:07.898
<i>...make sure the relatives cannot
see the cotton stuffing taking place...</i>

01:10:08.436 --> 01:10:11.872
<i>At times, we may need
to stuff the anus as well.</i>

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:15.009
<i>Roll up the cotton like this, and...</i>

01:10:16.578 --> 01:10:23.882
<i>push in all the way inside the anus
to prevent an outflow of body fluid.</i>

01:10:29.691 --> 01:10:31.716
What's this?

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.327
You looked through my desk
without my permission?

01:10:36.464 --> 01:10:38.261
That's not the issue.

01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:43.498
I just happened to be a model for this...

01:10:43.638 --> 01:10:46.903
I found out about your job too.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.278
So... what?

01:10:59.287 --> 01:11:01.414
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:01.823 --> 01:11:02.983
You would've been against it...

01:11:03.124 --> 01:11:06.685
Of course! Doing this kind of job...

01:11:07.829 --> 01:11:09.763
aren't you ashamed of it?

01:11:12.367 --> 01:11:13.994
Why should I be?

01:11:15.203 --> 01:11:17.262
Because I touch dead people every day?

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:21.807
I just want you to have a normal job.

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.274
What's normal?

01:11:25.146 --> 01:11:26.841
Everyone dies.

01:11:27.515 --> 01:11:29.278
I'll eventually die, and so will you.

01:11:31.152 --> 01:11:32.141
Death itself is normal.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.117
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.

01:11:37.592 --> 01:11:38.750
Please.

01:11:46.668 --> 01:11:51.068
I've never complained until now.

01:11:52.674 --> 01:11:55.006
When you wanted to quit the cello...

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:58.442
and when you said you wanted to
come back to the countryside...

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:01.674
I followed you with a smile.

01:12:04.552 --> 01:12:09.348
Of course, I was actually sad.

01:12:12.894 --> 01:12:14.186
But...

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.762
because I love you...

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:23.830
So please...

01:12:26.207 --> 01:12:28.307
just this once,

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:32.245
do what I ask.

01:12:42.657 --> 01:12:45.783
And if I said no?

01:12:54.502 --> 01:12:56.932
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?

01:13:11.953 --> 01:13:13.947
I'm going back to my parent's home.

01:13:14.589 --> 01:13:15.986
Come and get me after you quit your job.

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:16.991
Mika...

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:18.592
Don't touch me!

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.327
Filthy!

01:14:08.572 --> 01:14:09.596
It's wrong.

01:14:11.809 --> 01:14:12.673
Huh?

01:14:13.978 --> 01:14:17.573
My daughter didn't look like this.

01:14:20.785 --> 01:14:23.249
Her hair color is wrong...

01:14:24.855 --> 01:14:26.186
it's all wrong!

01:14:26.757 --> 01:14:28.588
<i>That's what she looks like!</i>

01:14:30.328 --> 01:14:31.654
What are you doing?!

01:14:34.198 --> 01:14:35.756
It's all wrong.

01:14:38.402 --> 01:14:39.630
Redo it.

01:14:41.472 --> 01:14:42.434
Yes.

01:14:43.507 --> 01:14:46.203
Why are you saying this now?

01:14:47.678 --> 01:14:50.073
This only happened...

01:14:50.448 --> 01:14:53.344
because you didn't raise her properly!

01:14:57.588 --> 01:14:59.613
You don't have to say it like that.

01:14:59.757 --> 01:15:01.156
What did you say?

01:15:01.592 --> 01:15:06.155
You also never paid any attention to her.

01:15:06.263 --> 01:15:07.787
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:11.601
<i>You got her on the damn bike,</i>

01:15:11.736 --> 01:15:15.035
<i>and you ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?</i>

01:15:15.172 --> 01:15:15.895
Stop.

01:15:16.674 --> 01:15:18.301
Stop, stop.

01:15:20.344 --> 01:15:21.311
It's you!

01:15:23.547 --> 01:15:24.771
Leave.

01:15:26.217 --> 01:15:29.516
It doesn't change the fact that
it's your fault Miyuki died.

01:15:32.289 --> 01:15:35.918
Can you make up for it?

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.456
Huh?

01:15:39.196 --> 01:15:43.792
Can you take that guy's job for the
rest of your life and make up for it?

01:15:45.636 --> 01:15:46.466
Huh?

01:15:48.105 --> 01:15:49.436
I'm sorry.

01:15:52.376 --> 01:15:53.775
I'm sorry!

01:15:57.381 --> 01:16:00.441
The boss will be sad to hear that.

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.811
What?

01:16:03.854 --> 01:16:05.681
He really liked you.

01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:07.887
He did?

01:16:08.025 --> 01:16:11.188
Yeah! You're our first ever employee!

01:16:12.263 --> 01:16:14.788
The interview was very simple despite that.

01:16:14.932 --> 01:16:16.957
He always acts on his instincts!

01:16:17.301 --> 01:16:19.731
He said he felt something in you.

01:16:22.773 --> 01:16:24.468
But still...

01:16:26.277 --> 01:16:30.145
Sorry, but please talk to him
in person if you want to quit.

01:16:30.915 --> 01:16:32.314
He's upstairs.

01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:00.838
Excuse me.

01:17:04.248 --> 01:17:05.272
Come on in.

01:17:05.816 --> 01:17:06.544
Okay.

01:17:20.397 --> 01:17:21.728
What have you been eating?

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.028
What?

01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:29.200
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?

01:17:30.074 --> 01:17:31.302
Yes...

01:17:33.677 --> 01:17:34.769
Eat here.

01:17:35.613 --> 01:17:37.547
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.

01:17:44.255 --> 01:17:46.723
Let's eat.

01:17:52.196 --> 01:17:53.163
What's this?

01:17:54.098 --> 01:17:55.326
Blowfish milt.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.591
It's best grilled, with salt.

01:18:22.226 --> 01:18:23.393
That's my wife.

01:18:24.929 --> 01:18:29.298
Passed away 9 years ago.

01:18:35.673 --> 01:18:38.706
All married couples are eventually
separated by a death,

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:42.340
but it's tough being the one left behind.

01:18:49.887 --> 01:18:53.983
I dressed her up, and sent her away.

01:19:00.831 --> 01:19:02.521
My very first client.

01:19:08.005 --> 01:19:10.132
I've been working in this business ever since.

01:19:13.277 --> 01:19:14.705
This too...

01:19:21.018 --> 01:19:24.920
This is a corpse too.

01:19:31.929 --> 01:19:35.462
The living eat the living to live.
Right?

01:19:37.368 --> 01:19:39.058
These plants are an exception.

01:19:46.443 --> 01:19:48.943
You have to eat if you don't want to die.

01:19:50.247 --> 01:19:53.376
If you're going to eat,
might as well taste good.

01:20:11.602 --> 01:20:12.561
Tasty, isn't it?

01:20:13.837 --> 01:20:15.265
It sure is.

01:20:15.673 --> 01:20:19.803
Yeah it is... sadly.

01:20:38.929 --> 01:20:42.330
<i>It's almost two weeks since I
returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.</i>

01:20:43.167 --> 01:20:47.356
<i>Now that I think of it, I've lead
such an unremarkable life.</i>

01:20:51.775 --> 01:20:56.678
<i>Will I really be able to
make a living with this job?</i>

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.578
Do you want to try?

01:21:09.093 --> 01:21:09.923
Yes.

01:22:18.495 --> 01:22:21.157
Slowly, lower from the head.

01:22:34.478 --> 01:22:35.502
Tomeo...

01:22:48.559 --> 01:22:50.049
Good bye.

01:22:54.998 --> 01:22:56.727
Thank you.

01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:05.099
We've been doing nothing but argue
since Tomeo started dressing up like that...

01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:09.607
I haven't looked straight into
his face for a long time.

01:23:10.514 --> 01:23:14.382
But... seeing him smile made me think...

01:23:15.419 --> 01:23:18.820
ah... he really is my child.

01:23:20.357 --> 01:23:22.382
Even if he looks like a girl...

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.987
he really is my child!

01:23:33.103 --> 01:23:37.096
Thank you so much!

01:24:03.934 --> 01:24:04.958
Tastes great!

01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:25.779
Is it tasty?

01:24:28.859 --> 01:24:30.321
...Sadly.

01:24:35.898 --> 01:24:38.028
Did you bring the cello?

01:24:39.436 --> 01:24:41.597
Really? I want to hear!

01:24:42.005 --> 01:24:43.233
I'll play a little bit.

01:24:48.545 --> 01:24:51.070
It's my first time listening to a cello live.

01:24:51.848 --> 01:24:53.782
You were in an orchestra too, right?

01:24:53.917 --> 01:24:55.908
Yes, but it went out of business right away.

01:24:56.053 --> 01:24:57.645
How long have you been playing?

01:24:58.956 --> 01:25:00.014
Ever since I was in kindergarten.

01:25:00.157 --> 01:25:02.057
Wow, for that long?

01:25:02.192 --> 01:25:04.752
This is also a children's cello...

01:25:05.495 --> 01:25:08.123
my father forced me to learn to play this.

01:25:08.298 --> 01:25:09.592
Your father had a fine taste.

01:25:09.633 --> 01:25:11.430
He's the worst father ever.

01:25:11.969 --> 01:25:14.199
He ran a small cafe,

01:25:14.338 --> 01:25:16.670
but he ran away with a waitress,
never came back.

01:25:16.807 --> 01:25:18.434
He really was the worst father ever.

01:25:19.142 --> 01:25:21.007
I wonder what he's doing now.

01:25:21.478 --> 01:25:24.038
Who knows, probably already dead.

01:25:28.919 --> 01:25:31.547
Well, what should I play?

01:25:32.823 --> 01:25:34.757
Let's see...

01:25:34.891 --> 01:25:36.381
something Christmassy.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:37.956
Yeah.

01:25:41.331 --> 01:25:45.233
Uh... will different religions bother you?

01:25:45.369 --> 01:25:46.734
Don't worry.

01:25:47.104 --> 01:25:49.538
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu...

01:25:49.673 --> 01:25:51.170
we handle all religions here.

01:25:52.743 --> 01:25:53.971
Then,

01:25:55.078 --> 01:25:57.979
for the Holy Night...

01:27:30.507 --> 01:27:32.737
<i>Yes, this is NK Agent.</i>

01:27:33.176 --> 01:27:35.235
<i>Thank you always for your business.</i>

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.640
<i>Yes, tomorrow.</i>

01:27:38.315 --> 01:27:39.839
<i>The name of the deceased is...</i>

01:27:40.183 --> 01:27:43.084
I will now prepare her for her last journey.

01:27:43.487 --> 01:27:46.650
Gently cover her toes...

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:47.688
Um...

01:27:50.527 --> 01:27:53.824
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.

01:27:55.564 --> 01:27:56.532
Okay.

01:28:01.204 --> 01:28:02.000
Grandma,

01:28:05.142 --> 01:28:07.372
bye-bye.

01:28:08.145 --> 01:28:10.613
Thank you for everything, grandma.

01:28:17.854 --> 01:28:19.879
...in the name of Jesus Christ...

01:28:20.157 --> 01:28:22.955
Amen.

01:29:07.804 --> 01:29:10.068
Boss has aged a lot!

01:30:30.153 --> 01:30:33.213
Thank you, honey.

01:31:34.584 --> 01:31:35.642
Mika!

01:31:39.723 --> 01:31:42.089
You haven't been cleaning this place?

01:31:43.426 --> 01:31:44.422
Occasionally.

01:31:44.728 --> 01:31:47.663
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.

01:31:49.399 --> 01:31:50.764
I cleaned twice.

01:31:53.436 --> 01:31:55.063
That's not "occasionally".

01:31:59.876 --> 01:32:03.107
You're a mess without me, as I thought.

01:32:08.885 --> 01:32:10.350
I have something to report too.

01:32:11.454 --> 01:32:12.450
What is it?

01:32:16.626 --> 01:32:18.253
I'm pregnant.

01:32:21.398 --> 01:32:22.797
Wow...

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.597
I'm going to be a father?

01:32:34.444 --> 01:32:38.540
So please start getting your life together.

01:32:42.485 --> 01:32:46.649
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?

01:32:50.093 --> 01:32:53.091
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.

01:32:54.431 --> 01:32:58.360
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.

01:33:11.481 --> 01:33:13.915
Yes, hello?

01:33:14.517 --> 01:33:16.883
What? Now?

01:33:19.022 --> 01:33:20.120
What?!

01:33:22.725 --> 01:33:26.053
Okay. I'll be there right away.

01:33:30.467 --> 01:33:33.868
You're going to work at a time like this?

01:33:36.005 --> 01:33:37.667
Lady at the bath house...

01:33:38.975 --> 01:33:40.401
passed away.

01:34:09.372 --> 01:34:11.135
She's my wife, Mika.

01:34:20.683 --> 01:34:23.508
She collapsed while carrying firewood...

01:34:24.787 --> 01:34:26.982
and passed away.

01:34:29.058 --> 01:34:31.558
She was working 'til the very end.

01:34:32.128 --> 01:34:35.029
It'll be lonely around here,

01:34:35.532 --> 01:34:38.000
without this bath house.

01:37:40.383 --> 01:37:43.875
Please wipe her face one by one,

01:37:44.053 --> 01:37:47.079
and bid her farewell one last time.

01:38:32.201 --> 01:38:33.595
Mom...

01:39:05.301 --> 01:39:06.666
Mother...

01:40:15.805 --> 01:40:17.067
Shiori.

01:40:19.509 --> 01:40:21.807
This is good-bye to your grandma.

01:40:24.113 --> 01:40:25.637
Mother...

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.918
Thank you for everything.

01:40:52.909 --> 01:40:54.672
This is where you work?

01:41:01.851 --> 01:41:05.844
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.

01:41:19.535 --> 01:41:22.732
Please allow me to close the 'window'.

01:41:38.454 --> 01:41:39.951
Thank you...

01:41:41.924 --> 01:41:43.716
see you again.

01:42:37.913 --> 01:42:41.076
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?

01:42:46.622 --> 01:42:48.089
Thank you.

01:42:54.296 --> 01:43:00.428
I guess people get a hunch about these things.

01:43:03.606 --> 01:43:09.567
Last winter, the two of us had
a little Christmas party.

01:43:11.881 --> 01:43:15.771
I didn't expect her to
celebrate it at this age.

01:43:16.619 --> 01:43:17.683
But...

01:43:18.487 --> 01:43:21.285
she said she wanted to have one no matter what.

01:43:22.692 --> 01:43:27.459
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles...

01:43:28.898 --> 01:43:31.196
and celebrated together.

01:43:33.903 --> 01:43:37.270
Then, out of the blue...

01:43:38.674 --> 01:43:42.974
she asked me to help her with the firewood.

01:43:46.215 --> 01:43:50.276
This must have been what she meant.

01:43:51.854 --> 01:43:57.884
I'm good at burning things.

01:44:05.601 --> 01:44:11.471
Working here for a long time makes me think...

01:44:13.576 --> 01:44:18.343
that death... is a gateway.

01:44:20.549 --> 01:44:25.179
Death doesn't mean the end,

01:44:26.722 --> 01:44:31.689
but leaving the present,
heading for the next stage.

01:44:33.696 --> 01:44:37.127
Truly a gateway.

01:44:39.368 --> 01:44:43.360
As a gatekeeper,

01:44:44.874 --> 01:44:48.002
I've seen off many people.

01:44:52.615 --> 01:44:54.282
"Have a nice trip,

01:44:55.885 --> 01:45:01.187
see you again", I would say...

01:45:27.783 --> 01:45:29.216
Mom...

01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:34.218
I'm sorry, mom...

01:45:37.693 --> 01:45:40.218
I'm sorry, mom.

01:45:45.734 --> 01:45:48.794
I'm sorry.

01:45:51.207 --> 01:45:52.469
Mom...

01:45:57.513 --> 01:46:01.074
I'm sorry, mom.

01:46:32.314 --> 01:46:33.611
What are you doing?

01:46:35.251 --> 01:46:36.343
This is it!

01:46:48.731 --> 01:46:49.659
Here.

01:46:51.734 --> 01:46:52.664
What?

01:46:56.505 --> 01:46:57.594
Stone-letter.

01:46:57.873 --> 01:46:58.737
"Stone-letter"?

01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:02.268
In the ancient times,

01:47:02.912 --> 01:47:05.676
before humans invented writing...

01:47:06.382 --> 01:47:08.782
they searched for the stone
that resembled their feelings,

01:47:08.918 --> 01:47:10.510
and gave it to another person.

01:47:11.387 --> 01:47:14.220
The person who received the stone,

01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:17.083
read the other person's feelings
by the weight and texture.

01:47:17.159 --> 01:47:22.096
For example, smooth texture
symbolizing a peaceful mind,

01:47:23.098 --> 01:47:26.431
and rough texture symbolizing
a concern for others.

01:47:43.218 --> 01:47:44.378
Thank you!

01:47:45.654 --> 01:47:47.082
What did you feel?

01:47:48.991 --> 01:47:50.019
It's a secret.

01:47:54.129 --> 01:47:55.987
That's a wonderful story.

01:47:56.565 --> 01:47:58.332
Who did you hear it from?

01:48:00.336 --> 01:48:01.603
My old man.

01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:08.803
Does that mean... that big stone too?

01:48:09.511 --> 01:48:12.207
Yes, I got it from my father.

01:48:15.517 --> 01:48:17.246
I never knew.

01:48:17.953 --> 01:48:21.184
"Let's give each other stone-letters
every year", he said...

01:48:21.323 --> 01:48:23.484
yet that was the only time.

01:48:23.959 --> 01:48:25.592
Such a lousy father!

01:48:52.788 --> 01:48:56.019
Can you play every day for the unborn baby?

01:48:56.158 --> 01:48:57.022
Sure.

01:49:11.473 --> 01:49:14.442
What nice weather.

01:49:28.657 --> 01:49:29.824
Good afternoon.

01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:33.651
Is this the Kobayashi residence?

01:49:34.096 --> 01:49:35.028
Yes.

01:49:35.597 --> 01:49:37.462
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.

01:49:38.233 --> 01:49:38.961
What...?

01:49:39.935 --> 01:49:42.802
Is she no longer here?

01:49:43.238 --> 01:49:49.074
No, uh... my mother-in-law
passed away two years ago.

01:49:49.945 --> 01:49:53.574
Really? Oh...

01:49:54.016 --> 01:49:55.244
Excuse me, can I see it?

01:49:55.517 --> 01:49:56.541
You're not supposed to...

01:50:02.605 --> 01:50:05.205
<i>KOBAYASHI HIDEKI
Death day and time: 18th, around 7:30</i>

01:50:05.206 --> 01:50:07.105
<i>Please come and collect his body!</i>

01:50:16.105 --> 01:50:18.039
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.

01:50:18.207 --> 01:50:20.300
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.

01:50:20.442 --> 01:50:24.435
What? Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.

01:50:28.584 --> 01:50:30.484
Father passed away.

01:50:30.619 --> 01:50:31.617
Whose?

01:50:32.721 --> 01:50:33.945
Yours.

01:50:37.292 --> 01:50:39.351
What do you mean?

01:50:40.462 --> 01:50:44.694
... is what they told me when I called
the Yurahama Fishing Association.

01:50:46.168 --> 01:50:49.934
Our address was in his belongings.

01:50:52.174 --> 01:50:54.734
But I don't even know him...

01:50:56.078 --> 01:50:58.046
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!

01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:01.271
And the person he ran away
with can take care of him.

01:51:02.851 --> 01:51:05.149
It seems he was alone the whole time.

01:51:09.458 --> 01:51:11.824
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.

01:51:12.461 --> 01:51:16.124
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.

01:51:24.406 --> 01:51:27.807
Anyway, we're no longer legally related...

01:51:28.677 --> 01:51:30.406
tell them I can't sign the documents.

01:51:30.546 --> 01:51:32.104
Thanks.

01:51:32.281 --> 01:51:33.038
Dai...

01:51:37.553 --> 01:51:38.850
Please go for him.

01:51:39.354 --> 01:51:40.821
Don't worry about it.

01:51:41.657 --> 01:51:43.625
Please, I'm begging you.

01:51:52.301 --> 01:51:53.695
I...

01:51:56.305 --> 01:51:59.172
abandoned my son in Hokkaido.

01:52:01.543 --> 01:52:02.771
He was 6 years old.

01:52:07.416 --> 01:52:09.145
I fell in love with someone...

01:52:10.919 --> 01:52:13.114
"Mommy, mommy"...

01:52:14.523 --> 01:52:16.496
he cried, but...

01:52:18.594 --> 01:52:22.826
I shook off his small arm, and left home.

01:52:33.875 --> 01:52:35.540
Your son...

01:52:38.413 --> 01:52:41.348
Of course I want to see him, but... I can't.

01:52:43.986 --> 01:52:45.210
Why not?

01:52:47.022 --> 01:52:49.449
Just go see him if you want to.

01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:04.561
Do all parents who've abandoned
their child act like that?

01:53:08.377 --> 01:53:10.277
Then you're all too irresponsible!

01:53:25.093 --> 01:53:26.685
Please, go for him.

01:53:27.062 --> 01:53:29.292
Go and see his last appearance.

01:53:46.515 --> 01:53:47.573
Dai...

01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:30.157
Boss...

01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:48.307
Hey...

01:54:53.148 --> 01:54:54.547
Take one you like.

01:55:01.056 --> 01:55:02.148
Go ahead.

01:55:25.414 --> 01:55:28.508
<i>He was already dead when
I showed up this morning.</i>

01:55:29.918 --> 01:55:31.545
<i>I was surprised.</i>

01:55:32.854 --> 01:55:34.822
<i>I don't know where he came from,</i>

01:55:35.690 --> 01:55:38.022
<i>but he came to this town by himself.</i>

01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:43.092
<i>He worked very hard at the port.</i>

01:55:43.965 --> 01:55:48.026
<i>So I let him live in this shack.</i>

01:55:48.603 --> 01:55:50.002
I see...

01:55:54.242 --> 01:55:57.405
He was a quiet man...

01:56:00.215 --> 01:56:05.676
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.

01:56:10.725 --> 01:56:13.592
People from the funeral home will be here soon.

01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:15.093
Okay.

01:56:37.819 --> 01:56:42.047
He's your father.

01:56:46.828 --> 01:56:48.795
I'm ashamed to admit...

01:56:50.699 --> 01:56:52.664
I don't recognize...

01:56:55.203 --> 01:56:57.268
his face.

01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.737
That he looked like this...

01:57:02.944 --> 01:57:05.075
It doesn't even ring a bell.

01:57:24.499 --> 01:57:28.435
What was this man's life?

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:34.074
He lived for 70-odd years...

01:57:35.043 --> 01:57:37.803
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.

01:57:41.583 --> 01:57:42.841
<i>He's here.</i>

01:57:45.053 --> 01:57:45.944
Thanks.

01:57:47.055 --> 01:57:49.023
Excuse us.

01:57:49.758 --> 01:57:51.191
Excuse us.

01:57:56.565 --> 01:57:58.027
Can I take him now?

01:58:16.551 --> 01:58:18.041
Let's just toss him in.

01:58:18.186 --> 01:58:19.153
Yeah.

01:58:20.655 --> 01:58:21.617
Um...

01:58:22.157 --> 01:58:22.987
Yes?

01:58:24.025 --> 01:58:25.754
May I?

01:58:25.961 --> 01:58:28.657
No, we can do it.

01:58:28.797 --> 01:58:32.563
Just give him a drink after
we place him into the coffin.

01:58:32.801 --> 01:58:33.768
Ready...

01:58:37.539 --> 01:58:38.836
What are you doing?

01:58:41.376 --> 01:58:43.002
My husband is...

01:58:43.745 --> 01:58:46.269
an encoffiner.

02:03:53.955 --> 02:03:55.349
Father...

02:04:00.495 --> 02:04:02.026
He's my father.

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:20.274
