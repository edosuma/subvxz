I got 3,000 up there,

06:51.161 --> 06:55.249

06:55.290 --> 06:59.418
They gotta let me in.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.418
It's my year,

06:59.460 --> 07:02.839
STAN: Who's that?

07:02.881 --> 07:06.968
You know who that is.

07:02.881 --> 07:06.968
That's T-Rex Pennebaker.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.888
Best player on the Brewers.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.306
T-Rex Pennebaker ain't

07:09.930 --> 07:11.306

07:11.348 --> 07:13.725

07:11.348 --> 07:13.725

07:13.767 --> 07:16.144
especially what you got

07:13.767 --> 07:16.144
in front of you,

07:13.767 --> 07:16.144
a living legend.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.230
A certified immortal.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.982
-And I know you don't know

07:24.527 --> 07:28.240
What you mean is "aged,"

07:24.527 --> 07:28.240

-Wow.

-Spring training.

You can practically

07:46.674 --> 07:49.344

07:49.386 --> 07:50.762
Can't say I can, man.

What, you don't miss it?

07:54.433 --> 07:55.475
STAN: Miss it?

07:55.892 --> 07:56.893
Nah.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.355
Nah.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.026
See, Stan didn't make

08:02.857 --> 08:05.026
too many friends

08:02.857 --> 08:05.026
when he was playing here.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.696
He wasn't very good

08:06.569 --> 08:08.696
with the press.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.533
We invited him

08:08.738 --> 08:12.533
to Old-Timers' Day

08:08.738 --> 08:12.533

08:12.575 --> 08:16.371
That's nine years.

08:12.575 --> 08:16.371
And he never RSVP'd once.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.207
Look, he might not even

08:16.413 --> 08:19.207
want to do this,

08:16.413 --> 08:19.207
you know what I'm saying?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.251
No. What are you saying?

08:21.293 --> 08:24.587
I'm just saying,

10:16.116 --> 10:19.369
I think he played with you

10:16.116 --> 10:19.369

10:19.411 --> 10:21.496
He was a middle reliever.

We're lucky we got him.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.843
You know, a lot of people

said that Stan only

10:30.880 --> 10:35.843
looked out for himself,

that he wasn't

10:35.885 --> 10:38.679
a team player.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.474
But I'm here to tell you

10:40.515 --> 10:44.727
that if you get 3,000 hits,

10:40.515 --> 10:44.727
you don't have to be

10:40.515 --> 10:44.727
a team player.

gonna have to wait...

18:54.842 --> 18:57.344
MAN 1: I thought

18:54.842 --> 18:57.344
when we retired his number,

18:57.386 --> 18:59.430
we wouldn't have to see

18:57.386 --> 18:59.430
that prick anymore.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.349
MAN 2: He's a senior

18:59.472 --> 19:02.349
I want him here?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.644
And he hasn't played

19:02.391 --> 19:04.644
the game in nine years.

we're in

19:04.685 --> 19:06.980
the American League anymore,

19:07.021 --> 19:08.982
so he's gotta

19:07.021 --> 19:08.982
play the field.

19:09.023 --> 19:12.526
MAN 2: Can he even

19:09.023 --> 19:12.526
handle first base

19:09.023 --> 19:12.526
at his age, let alone hit?

Fellas.

19:14.487 --> 19:19.784
We are in fifth place,

and we are not

19:14.487 --> 19:19.784
drawing flies.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.370
And we've got two

19:19.826 --> 19:23.370
very long months

19:19.826 --> 19:23.370
ahead of us.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.915
The biggest crowd

19:23.412 --> 19:25.915
we've had all year

19:25.957 --> 19:28.375
was the day we retired

19:25.957 --> 19:28.375
Stan's number.

19:30.210 --> 19:34.340
Now, we give him a physical.

19:30.210 --> 19:34.340
Give him a month

19:30.210 --> 19:34.340
to get in shape.

19:34.381 --> 19:38.052
Then after that

19:34.381 --> 19:38.052
September roster expansion,

19:34.381 --> 19:38.052
if he's up to it,

19:38.094 --> 19:39.178
we put him in the lineup.

-Bo, all I need is a bat.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.850
-That's it, baby.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.020
Look at him.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.020
He ain't got no waist

19:43.891 --> 19:47.020
on him. He got nothin'.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.690
-Stan Ross.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.690
-Hey.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.358
Eddie Richling.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.358
I'm the conditioning coach.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.236
He here to carry you home?

19:56.278 --> 19:57.571
The only thing

19:56.278 --> 19:57.571
Boca gonna carry

19:57.613 --> 19:58.906
is my plaque

19:57.613 --> 19:58.906
to the Hall of Fame.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.950
-That's why I love you, man.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.950
-I love you more, baby.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.409
-Oh, is that right?

20:00.992 --> 20:02.409
-That's right.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.662
-How many push-ups

20:02.451 --> 20:04.662
can you do?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.662
-One arm or two?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.080
Well, I'll tell you what,

20:04.704 --> 20:06.080
man.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.749
Last time I counted, man,

20:06.122 --> 20:08.749
what was it, about 40, 50?

20:08.791 --> 20:11.418
Mmm-hmm.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.254
I got five bucks in

20:11.460 --> 20:14.254
my pocket says

20:11.460 --> 20:14.254
you can't give me ten.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.799
(CHUCKLES) That's easy

20:14.296 --> 20:16.799
money. Back up, man.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.968
-Boca, you better help

20:16.841 --> 20:18.968
your boy down.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.968
-He didn't help me in.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.762
Come on,

20:20.386 --> 20:21.762
let's see what you got.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.685
Okay, well, that's one.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.026
(LAUGHING)

20:35.735 --> 20:37.153
How many is that?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.363
Oh, I don't know.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.363
I'd say 40, 50.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.907
BOCA: That's four.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.742
Come on, Stan.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.742
You got this one.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.706
Oh, oh, oh!

20:46.662 --> 20:48.706
Your knee touched, man.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.957
That's a girl push-up.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.957
That don't count.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.667
You see my knee touch, Boca?

20:51.709 --> 20:56.047
Well, it might have, yeah.

20:51.709 --> 20:56.047
But who said girl push-ups

20:51.709 --> 20:56.047
don't count?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.757
Yeah, who said

20:56.089 --> 20:57.757
girl push-ups don't count?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.425
How you want to pay me,

20:57.798 --> 20:59.425
cash or check?

21:04.346 --> 21:06.640
Oh, look at them arms

21:04.346 --> 21:06.640
starting to shake.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.852
Come on. Come on.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.148
Ahhh!

21:14.190 --> 21:17.818
Okay, Stan, now you ready

21:14.190 --> 21:17.818
to get started for real?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.528
Man, what type of shit

21:17.860 --> 21:19.528
is this?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.489
Hydrostatic weighing.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.160
It's how we're gonna

21:22.531 --> 21:26.160
determine how much body fat

21:22.531 --> 21:26.160
you really have.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.704
I don't need my balls washed

21:26.202 --> 21:28.704
to tell you how much

21:26.202 --> 21:28.704
I weigh.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.206
Hold your breath, Stan.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.416
This ain't nothin'

21:30.248 --> 21:32.416
but a Southern baptism.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.835
It's called modern

21:32.458 --> 21:34.835
technology, Stan.

21:34.877 --> 21:38.005
Recently, the Brewers have

21:34.877 --> 21:38.005
incorporated new methods

21:34.877 --> 21:38.005
of training

21:38.047 --> 21:40.007
into their exercise regimen.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.675
We're gonna get you started

21:40.049 --> 21:41.675
on this bad boy.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.470
-Look at this.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.470
-Mmm-hmm.

21:44.511 --> 21:48.515
-This looks like

21:44.511 --> 21:48.515
some punishment.

21:44.511 --> 21:48.515
-Actually, it's very gentle.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.060
-It's called pilates.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.060
-Pi-what?

37:10.103 --> 37:14.983
well, every Brewer but Stan

37:10.103 --> 37:14.983
that played had a hit.

37:15.025 --> 37:18.028
Our Maureen Simmons

37:15.025 --> 37:18.028
was at the game

37:15.025 --> 37:18.028
and had post-game duty.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.362
Not the day Stan Ross

37:19.404 --> 37:21.948
or the Milwaukee fans

37:19.404 --> 37:21.948
had in mind.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.617
Word around the organization

37:21.990 --> 37:24.617
is that manager Gus Panas

37:24.659 --> 37:27.996
is particularly unhappy

37:24.659 --> 37:27.996
having Ross back

37:24.659 --> 37:27.996
in the lineup.

37:28.038 --> 37:31.208
Apparently, he hasn't

37:28.038 --> 37:31.208
forgotten the way that Stan

37:28.038 --> 37:31.208
abandoned the team

37:31.249 --> 37:35.921
in the middle

37:31.249 --> 37:35.921
of the pennant race

37:31.249 --> 37:35.921
nine years ago. Stuart.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.131
The press

37:35.962 --> 37:38.131
is having a field day.

37:38.173 --> 37:42.385
Hey, they're just

37:38.173 --> 37:42.385
getting even with Stan

37:38.173 --> 37:42.385
for all the years of abuse.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.262
For turning this team

37:42.427 --> 37:44.262
into a laughingstock.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.599
Five games and hasn't

37:44.303 --> 37:47.599
gotten close to a hit.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.768
How long

37:47.640 --> 37:49.768
do we let this go on?

37:51.519 --> 37:54.773
We got 35,000 people

37:51.519 --> 37:54.773
in the park today.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.819
We're committed to this

37:59.861 --> 38:03.489
whether Stan Ross ever gets

37:59.861 --> 38:03.489
another hit or not.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.953
You sure you don't

38:05.491 --> 38:07.953
want anything stronger

38:05.491 --> 38:07.953
than that club soda?

38:07.994 --> 38:10.580
-Oh, no, I'm good.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.580
-Thanks, Boca.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.292
-Why you call him Boca?

38:11.831 --> 38:14.292
-Look at him.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.170
He look like he's ready

38:14.333 --> 38:17.170

38:14.333 --> 38:17.170

38:17.212 --> 38:21.007
-Stan don't appreciate

38:17.212 --> 38:21.007
my velour.

38:17.212 --> 38:21.007
-That's all he wears.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.969

38:21.049 --> 38:23.969
a black one for funerals.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.722
a little bit too serious.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.349
-Hey, a lifetime supply.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.349
-That's why I love you.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.602
-No, no,

38:30.391 --> 38:32.602

38:30.391 --> 38:32.602
-No, I love you more.

38:36.355 --> 38:39.776

38:39.818 --> 38:42.779
-Mmm. You, too, Tony.

38:45.406 --> 38:49.869

38:45.406 --> 38:49.869

38:55.541 --> 38:58.336

50:25.314 --> 50:27.775

This guy hasn't played

50:27.817 --> 50:30.194

50:27.817 --> 50:30.194

50:30.235 --> 50:32.822
possible to get out

50:30.235 --> 50:32.822

50:34.532 --> 50:35.867
SALLEY:  Don't say that, man.

50:34.532 --> 50:35.867

ARNOLD:  The Brewers

50:37.660 --> 50:39.411
knew exactly

50:37.660 --> 50:39.411
what they were getting into.

50:39.453 --> 50:42.414
It's a publicity stunt,

50:39.453 --> 50:42.414
just like when the White Sox

50:39.453 --> 50:42.414
hired that midget.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.792
SALLEY: Tom, you can't say

50:42.456 --> 50:44.792
"midget." They're called

50:42.456 --> 50:44.792
small people now.

That guy was small

50:44.834 --> 50:47.085

50:47.127 --> 50:48.671
It's like if the Red Sox

50:47.127 --> 50:48.671
thawed out Ted Williams,

50:48.713 --> 50:50.422
although he'd hit better

50:48.713 --> 50:50.422

He's embarrassing him.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.804
He should just give it up.

50:56.846 --> 50:59.932
You know, when an athlete

50:56.846 --> 50:59.932
gets to that point,

50:56.846 --> 50:59.932
he loses all his pride.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.308

51:01.350 --> 51:02.768

He's embarrassed.

51:07.899 --> 51:09.650
Definitely embarrassed.

1:14:04.690 --> 1:14:06.692
(CLAPPING)

1:14:06.734 --> 1:14:09.445
Huh? Who the old man, baby?

1:14:09.486 --> 1:14:11.530
-Who's the old man, baby?

1:14:09.486 --> 1:14:11.530
-21!

1:14:11.572 --> 1:14:14.367
Who's the old man, baby?

1:14:11.572 --> 1:14:14.367
Huh?

1:14:15.743 --> 1:14:18.162
I got your "old man," baby.

1:14:18.204 --> 1:14:21.332
I got your "old man."

1:14:21.374 --> 1:14:23.626
-Way to go, Stan.

1:14:21.374 --> 1:14:23.626
-I gave 'em their money

1:14:21.374 --> 1:14:23.626
worth tonight.

1:14:23.667 --> 1:14:25.336
Outstanding, outstanding.

1:14:25.378 --> 1:14:26.754
-You feel good?

1:14:25.378 --> 1:14:26.754
-I feel great.

1:14:26.796 --> 1:14:29.715
You look great.

1:14:26.796 --> 1:14:29.715
You looked like

1:14:26.796 --> 1:14:29.715
a champion out there.

1:14:29.757 --> 1:14:32.051
-Stan, let me paint you

1:14:29.757 --> 1:14:32.051
a little picture.

1:14:29.757 --> 1:14:32.051
-Go ahead.

1:14:32.093 --> 1:14:33.928
Miller Park,

1:14:32.093 --> 1:14:33.928
standing room only.

1:14:33.970 --> 1:14:35.221
-You got that?

1:14:33.970 --> 1:14:35.221
-I got it.

1:14:35.263 --> 1:14:38.099
43,000 screaming fans,

1:14:38.141 --> 1:14:41.018
and they're there

1:14:38.141 --> 1:14:41.018
for one reason

1:14:38.141 --> 1:14:41.018
and one reason only.

1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:45.064
To watch the legendary

1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:45.064
Stan Ross step to the plate

1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:45.064
and dig in.

1:14:45.106 --> 1:14:47.691
Shoot, ain't no picture.

1:14:45.106 --> 1:14:47.691
That's a damn Rembrandt.

1:14:47.733 --> 1:14:50.820
I agree, and that's why

1:14:47.733 --> 1:14:50.820
I'm telling Gus not to

1:14:47.733 --> 1:14:50.820
play you on the road.

1:14:52.405 --> 1:14:54.490
(STAMMERING) Hold on, man.

1:14:52.405 --> 1:14:54.490
Chill out, baby.

1:14:54.531 --> 1:14:56.951
What are you talking about?

1:14:54.531 --> 1:14:56.951
Man, we're on a roll,

1:14:54.531 --> 1:14:56.951
Schembri.

1:14:56.993 --> 1:14:58.619
We're going for third place.

1:14:58.661 --> 1:15:02.039
-You're one hit away

1:14:58.661 --> 1:15:02.039
from making history, Stan.

1:14:58.661 --> 1:15:02.039
-Oh...

1:15:02.081 --> 1:15:05.918
Don't you think

1:15:02.081 --> 1:15:05.918
you owe it to the fans

1:15:02.081 --> 1:15:05.918
to do it here at home? Hmm?

1:15:07.711 --> 1:15:09.922
I don't know, Schiembri.

1:15:07.711 --> 1:15:09.922
You're takin'

1:15:07.711 --> 1:15:09.922
half my bats away.

1:15:09.964 --> 1:15:13.009
Although I hit a home run,

1:15:09.964 --> 1:15:13.009
I'm still 2 for 51.

1:15:13.050 --> 1:15:14.718
MASCOT: 2 for 58!

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:16.429
Stan Ross is at the plate!

1:15:16.471 --> 1:15:19.723
The fans, they sit and wait,

1:15:16.471 --> 1:15:19.723
even though

1:15:16.471 --> 1:15:19.723
his swing's too late.

1:15:19.765 --> 1:15:22.143
Look, what I'm sayin' is,

1:15:19.765 --> 1:15:22.143
come on, don't cut me out.

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:24.061
The team need me.

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:24.061
Come on, now.

1:15:24.103 --> 1:15:26.647
Stan, you heard the sausage.

1:15:24.103 --> 1:15:26.647
You're 2 for 58.

1:15:26.689 --> 1:15:28.691
The team doesn't need you

1:15:26.689 --> 1:15:28.691
to get third place.

1:15:28.732 --> 1:15:30.693
They're on fire!

1:15:28.732 --> 1:15:30.693
Come on, let's face it.

1:15:30.734 --> 1:15:35.406
But you, my friend, you have

1:15:30.734 --> 1:15:35.406
got to start thinking about

1:15:30.734 --> 1:15:35.406
life after baseball.

1:15:35.448 --> 1:15:37.950
I'm talking endorsements,

1:15:35.448 --> 1:15:37.950
product lines.

1:15:39.118 --> 1:15:40.286
A Stan Ross candy bar.

1:15:44.457 --> 1:15:46.250
I want you doing press

1:15:44.457 --> 1:15:46.250
all week long

1:15:46.292 --> 1:15:47.793
on the road, Stan.

1:15:47.835 --> 1:15:49.045
You pull this off,

1:15:49.086 --> 1:15:51.797
nothing's gonna keep you

1:15:49.086 --> 1:15:51.797
out of the Hall of Fame.

1:15:52.465 --> 1:15:54.300
You're a champion.

1:16:00.139 --> 1:16:01.849
Hey, Stan, Tom Arnold here.

1:16:00.139 --> 1:16:01.849
Congratulations

1:16:00.139 --> 1:16:01.849
on everything.

1:16:01.891 --> 1:16:03.726
The team's on a tear.

1:16:01.891 --> 1:16:03.726
You won seven in a row.

1:16:03.767 --> 1:16:05.520
You guys could finish third.

1:16:05.561 --> 1:16:07.771
Are you really talking to us

1:16:05.561 --> 1:16:07.771
from the clubhouse

1:16:05.561 --> 1:16:07.771
during the game?

1:16:07.813 --> 1:16:10.400
Well, they're not gonna

1:16:07.813 --> 1:16:10.400
play me until I come home

1:16:07.813 --> 1:16:10.400
off the road,

1:16:10.441 --> 1:16:13.444
so I might as well do

1:16:10.441 --> 1:16:13.444
something else with my time.

1:16:13.486 --> 1:16:15.696
Stan, how does it feel not

1:16:13.486 --> 1:16:15.696
to be playing right now?

1:16:15.738 --> 1:16:18.282
It don't feel good,

1:16:15.738 --> 1:16:18.282
especially the way I've been

1:16:15.738 --> 1:16:18.282
swinging the bat,

1:16:18.324 --> 1:16:20.326
but that's

1:16:18.324 --> 1:16:20.326
the skip's decision.

1:16:18.324 --> 1:16:20.326
I have to go with it

1:16:20.368 --> 1:16:22.661
because, as you say,

1:16:20.368 --> 1:16:22.661
we got a chance

1:16:20.368 --> 1:16:22.661
to make third place.

1:16:22.703 --> 1:16:24.955
And they were in fifth place

1:16:22.703 --> 1:16:24.955
when you got there.

1:16:24.997 --> 1:16:27.624
I finally got them playin'

1:16:24.997 --> 1:16:27.624
patented Stan Ross baseball.

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:29.126
-Okay, Stan.

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:29.126
-Hey, Stan...

1:16:29.168 --> 1:16:30.753
Stan Ross, at 47,

1:16:29.168 --> 1:16:30.753
the oldest man

1:16:30.794 --> 1:16:32.296
ever to home run

1:16:30.794 --> 1:16:32.296
in the major leagues.

1:16:32.338 --> 1:16:33.506
How's it feel, slugger?

1:16:33.548 --> 1:16:34.673
To tell you the truth, Stan,

1:16:34.715 --> 1:16:36.217
we never thought

1:16:34.715 --> 1:16:36.217
you could do it,

1:16:36.259 --> 1:16:37.718
and some of us

1:16:36.259 --> 1:16:37.718
hoped you wouldn't,

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:39.512
-so we owe you

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:39.512
an apology big-time.

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:39.512
-(AUDIENCE BOOING)

1:16:39.554 --> 1:16:42.098
Well, you know,

1:16:39.554 --> 1:16:42.098
it takes a big man

1:16:39.554 --> 1:16:42.098
to admit when they wrong,

1:16:42.139 --> 1:16:44.600
but like my teammate,

1:16:42.139 --> 1:16:44.600
Kenji Fukuda,

1:16:42.139 --> 1:16:44.600
taught me to say...

1:16:44.641 --> 1:16:45.768
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

1:16:45.809 --> 1:16:47.644
You guys are

1:16:45.809 --> 1:16:47.644
world class pricks.

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:49.313
What? What the hell

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:49.313
is he talking about?

1:16:49.355 --> 1:16:50.731
-Stan.

1:16:49.355 --> 1:16:50.731
-What does the future hold?

1:16:50.773 --> 1:16:52.649
-Yeah, Stan.

1:16:50.773 --> 1:16:52.649
-What about number 3,000?

1:16:52.691 --> 1:16:54.026
What about it?

1:16:54.068 --> 1:16:55.278
What game are you actually

1:16:54.068 --> 1:16:55.278
gonna get this hit in?

1:16:55.319 --> 1:16:56.404
I think I'm gonna get it

1:16:55.319 --> 1:16:56.404
on the next at bat.

1:16:56.446 --> 1:16:57.863
You got another homer

1:16:56.446 --> 1:16:57.863
left in you?

1:16:57.905 --> 1:16:59.990
Keep your popcorn by your

1:16:57.905 --> 1:16:59.990
side 'cause it's comin'.

1:17:00.032 --> 1:17:01.409

1:17:01.451 --> 1:17:03.160
-Stan Ross.

1:17:01.451 --> 1:17:03.160
-Is it gonna be a home run?

1:17:03.202 --> 1:17:05.538
Well, the faster

1:17:03.202 --> 1:17:05.538
you throw it in,

1:17:03.202 --> 1:17:05.538
the quicker it's goin' out.

1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:07.331
(ALL LAUGHING)

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:09.459
Hey, Stan. Listen, I hope

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:09.459
you weren't listening

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:09.459
to all the trash

1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:11.419
we were talking about you

1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:11.419
before you hit your groove.

1:17:11.461 --> 1:17:14.547
Tom, you wouldn't be

1:17:11.461 --> 1:17:14.547
where you are if it wasn't

1:17:11.461 --> 1:17:14.547
for Roseanne. You know?

1:17:14.589 --> 1:17:16.173
(LAUGHING)

1:17:16.215 --> 1:17:18.509
You know what?

1:17:16.215 --> 1:17:18.509
That would have hurt

1:17:16.215 --> 1:17:18.509
if it wasn't true.

1:17:18.551 --> 1:17:20.052
-Stan Ross.

(SIGHS)

1:17:30.521 --> 1:17:32.189
You know, you're starting

1:17:30.521 --> 1:17:32.189
to sound a little like

1:17:30.521 --> 1:17:32.189
the old Stan now.

1:17:32.231 --> 1:17:34.525
No, sweetheart, you gettin'

1:17:32.231 --> 1:17:34.525
the best of both worlds.

Old and new Stan Ross.

1:17:34.567 --> 1:17:37.778
Team player, baby.

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:41.157
All right, so after you go

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:41.157
national with all the press,

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:41.157
what's gonna be left for me?

1:17:41.198 --> 1:17:43.033
-I'm gonna tell you what's

1:17:41.198 --> 1:17:43.033
gonna be left for you.

1:17:41.198 --> 1:17:43.033
-Hmm.

1:17:43.075 --> 1:17:45.661
I'm gonna give you

1:17:43.075 --> 1:17:45.661
a special exclusive.

1:17:45.702 --> 1:17:49.457
Meet me at the ball park,

1:17:45.702 --> 1:17:49.457
Thursday morning at 9:00.

1:17:49.499 --> 1:17:53.336
Just you, me, and the team.

1:17:53.377 --> 1:17:54.795
See, I called

1:17:53.377 --> 1:17:54.795
a special practice

1:17:54.837 --> 1:17:56.339
on my day off

1:17:54.837 --> 1:17:56.339
on our last home stand.

1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:59.716
Wait a minute.

1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:59.716
Stan Ross called

1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:59.716
for an extra practice?

1:17:59.758 --> 1:18:02.386
Now, I never thought

1:17:59.758 --> 1:18:02.386
I'd live to see this day.

1:18:02.428 --> 1:18:05.473
I guess you are getting

1:18:02.428 --> 1:18:05.473
a little serious, huh?

1:18:05.515 --> 1:18:07.350
Maybe I'm gettin'

1:18:05.515 --> 1:18:07.350
serious about you.

1:18:12.771 --> 1:18:14.273

I got a new

1:18:44.220 --> 1:18:47.139
PlayStation game,

1:18:44.220 --> 1:18:47.139
Hall of Fame Baseball,

1:18:47.181 --> 1:18:49.141
where I get a chance to hit

1:18:47.181 --> 1:18:49.141
against all those pitchers

1:18:49.183 --> 1:18:51.561
that were dead

1:18:49.183 --> 1:18:51.561
before I was born,

1:18:49.183 --> 1:18:51.561
like Walter Johnson

1:18:51.602 --> 1:18:54.230
and Christy Mathewson,

1:18:51.602 --> 1:18:54.230
and that candy-ass Cy Young.

1:18:54.271 --> 1:18:56.315
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1:18:54.271 --> 1:18:56.315
-Well, draw up the plans.

1:18:56.357 --> 1:18:59.360
You got a call an hour ago

1:18:56.357 --> 1:18:59.360
from  The Tonight Show.

1:18:59.402 --> 1:19:02.613
-They want you

1:18:59.402 --> 1:19:02.613
on there tomorrow.

1:18:59.402 --> 1:19:02.613
-I'm on a roll, man.

1:19:02.655 --> 1:19:04.574
I'm tellin' you.

1:19:02.655 --> 1:19:04.574
That's big-time exposure.

1:19:04.615 --> 1:19:07.034
Well, here's the hook.

1:19:04.615 --> 1:19:07.034
They want you

1:19:04.615 --> 1:19:07.034
at the studio at 9:00.

1:19:08.035 --> 1:19:09.203
That's cool.

1:19:09.245 --> 1:19:11.205
But you got that extra

1:19:09.245 --> 1:19:11.205
practice in the morning.

1:19:11.247 --> 1:19:13.666
That's one practice.

1:19:11.247 --> 1:19:13.666
One practice.

1:19:13.708 --> 1:19:16.335
I'm talking about Jay Leno.

1:19:13.708 --> 1:19:16.335
That's bigger than the game.

1:19:17.836 --> 1:19:20.089
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1:19:20.130 --> 1:19:21.674
JAY LENO:  Stan Ross!

1:19:20.130 --> 1:19:21.674
Come on out here, Stan!

1:19:24.510 --> 1:19:26.303
What's up?

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:31.559
What's up, baby?

1:19:31.601 --> 1:19:33.018
All on, baby.

1:19:33.060 --> 1:19:34.437
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

1:19:35.062 --> 1:19:36.146
(GRUNTS)

1:19:36.188 --> 1:19:37.648
Have a seat.

1:19:38.733 --> 1:19:40.901
All right.

1:19:40.943 --> 1:19:43.696
All right. Team Brewer

1:19:40.943 --> 1:19:43.696
is on a roll, making

1:19:40.943 --> 1:19:43.696
a push for third place.

1:19:43.738 --> 1:19:47.491
(LAUGHS) Baby,

1:19:43.738 --> 1:19:47.491
I'm on a roll, too, Jay.

1:19:43.738 --> 1:19:47.491
I'm on a roll, too.

1:19:47.533 --> 1:19:50.745
I'm sure to stay

1:19:47.533 --> 1:19:50.745
on that roll you're

1:19:47.533 --> 1:19:50.745
taking Ensure every day...

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:52.162
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:52.162
-Is it once a day?

1:19:52.204 --> 1:19:53.497
And then, you have

1:19:52.204 --> 1:19:53.497
a sensible meal for dinner.

1:19:53.539 --> 1:19:55.165
I'm not sure.

1:19:53.539 --> 1:19:55.165
How does it work?

1:19:55.207 --> 1:19:58.001
I can do anything

1:19:55.207 --> 1:19:58.001
a 20-year-old can do.

1:19:55.207 --> 1:19:58.001
Any doggone thing, baby.

1:19:58.043 --> 1:19:59.878
-Anything, huh?

1:19:58.043 --> 1:19:59.878
-Show you right.

1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:02.548
Show you right.

1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:02.548
And I can do it all night.

1:20:02.590 --> 1:20:05.676
Dave? Yeah, there's a large

1:20:02.590 --> 1:20:05.676
black man hitting

1:20:02.590 --> 1:20:05.676
on your wife.

1:20:05.718 --> 1:20:07.637
(ALL LAUGHING)

1:20:07.678 --> 1:20:09.430
-Yeah, show you right.

1:20:07.678 --> 1:20:09.430
-So what's next?

1:20:09.472 --> 1:20:13.183
I started my own

1:20:09.472 --> 1:20:13.183
little stuff right here.

1:20:09.472 --> 1:20:13.183
Check it out. Look at that.

1:20:13.225 --> 1:20:16.019
-My own little candy

1:20:13.225 --> 1:20:16.019
Ross bar.

1:20:13.225 --> 1:20:16.019
-"Ross Bar."

1:20:16.061 --> 1:20:18.230
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1:20:16.061 --> 1:20:18.230
-Get a shot of that one.

1:20:18.272 --> 1:20:20.650
That is the most ratty-ass

1:20:18.272 --> 1:20:20.650
candy bar I've ever seen.

1:20:20.691 --> 1:20:23.902
What is that? It's a piece

1:20:20.691 --> 1:20:23.902
of loose leaf paper

1:20:20.691 --> 1:20:23.902
you wrote "Ross Bar" on.

1:20:23.944 --> 1:20:25.696
-It's a prototype.

1:20:23.944 --> 1:20:25.696
-Oh, the prototype.

1:20:25.738 --> 1:20:28.865
You gotta start somewhere.

1:20:25.738 --> 1:20:28.865
I'm an entrepreneur.

1:20:28.907 --> 1:20:30.242
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:20:30.284 --> 1:20:31.452
You know,

1:20:30.284 --> 1:20:31.452
once you get over

1:20:30.284 --> 1:20:31.452
the initial modesty,

1:20:31.494 --> 1:20:32.703
I think you'll be fine.

1:20:32.745 --> 1:20:34.913
You talkin' to the ladies'

1:20:32.745 --> 1:20:34.913
pet the men regret.

1:20:34.955 --> 1:20:36.457
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1:20:34.955 --> 1:20:36.457
-I'm Stan Ross.

1:20:36.499 --> 1:20:39.084
-What's my name, baby?

1:20:36.499 --> 1:20:39.084
-AUDIENCE: Stan Ross!

1:20:39.126 --> 1:20:41.086
-They call me what?

1:20:39.126 --> 1:20:41.086
-The boss!

1:20:41.128 --> 1:20:42.755
-Because I...

1:20:41.128 --> 1:20:42.755
-Pay the cost!

1:20:42.797 --> 1:20:44.173
-Because I'm...

1:20:42.797 --> 1:20:44.173
-Stan Ross!

1:20:44.214 --> 1:20:46.883
-Turn it up, baby!

1:20:44.214 --> 1:20:46.883
-(BAND PLAYING FUNK MUSIC)

1:20:46.925 --> 1:20:48.177
Stan Ross!

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:50.721
Be right back

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:50.721
right after this.

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:50.721
Don't go away.

1:20:50.763 --> 1:20:52.556
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1:20:54.016 --> 1:20:55.434
Yes, sir.

1:20:55.476 --> 1:20:57.978
Boca! Yo, Bo!

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:59.689
Did you see me, baby?

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:59.689
(LAUGHS)

1:20:59.730 --> 1:21:02.441
Jay and I did our thing.

1:20:59.730 --> 1:21:02.441
That ain't no ESPN.

1:21:02.483 --> 1:21:04.151
I'm talkin' big-time.

1:21:07.988 --> 1:21:09.406
Hey. Hey, baby.

1:21:09.448 --> 1:21:11.367
Don't you "baby" me.

1:21:11.408 --> 1:21:13.661
I went to the

1:21:11.408 --> 1:21:13.661
ball park this morning,

1:21:11.408 --> 1:21:13.661
and you weren't there.

1:21:13.703 --> 1:21:16.121
Your entire team was there,

1:21:13.703 --> 1:21:16.121
and you're a no-show.

1:21:17.039 --> 1:21:18.874
-Well, I mean...

1:21:17.039 --> 1:21:18.874
-"Well"?

1:21:18.915 --> 1:21:20.835
Didn't you call

1:21:18.915 --> 1:21:20.835
for the practice?

1:21:20.876 --> 1:21:22.670
And besides letting down

1:21:20.876 --> 1:21:22.670
your teammates,

1:21:22.712 --> 1:21:25.589
you told me

1:21:22.712 --> 1:21:25.589
I could interview you.

1:21:25.631 --> 1:21:26.923
Well, come on,

1:21:25.631 --> 1:21:26.923
interview me now.

1:21:26.965 --> 1:21:28.217
Come on, turn the camera on.

1:21:28.258 --> 1:21:30.427
It's not like

1:21:28.258 --> 1:21:30.427
I'm hiding from you, baby.

1:21:30.469 --> 1:21:32.513
I'll come right around.

1:21:30.469 --> 1:21:32.513
That ain't nothin'.

1:21:32.555 --> 1:21:35.349
Shoot. Come on, baby.

1:21:35.391 --> 1:21:37.601
All right, forget this.

1:21:35.391 --> 1:21:37.601
I'll just freestyle it.

1:21:37.643 --> 1:21:40.437
-Mark, Steve, are you ready?

1:21:37.643 --> 1:21:40.437
-Didn't ask if I'm ready.

1:21:40.479 --> 1:21:42.773
-Well, you always ready.

1:21:40.479 --> 1:21:42.773
-Let me get on that side.

1:21:42.815 --> 1:21:44.483
You can see the balls.

1:21:42.815 --> 1:21:44.483
It looks better.

1:21:44.525 --> 1:21:46.026
-Hey, how you doin'?

1:21:44.525 --> 1:21:46.026
-All right, Stan.

1:21:46.068 --> 1:21:47.444
STAN: Good.

1:21:47.486 --> 1:21:48.779
(CLEARS THROAT)

1:21:47.486 --> 1:21:48.779
Come on, baby.

1:21:51.365 --> 1:21:54.368
I'm here with Hall of Famer

1:21:51.365 --> 1:21:54.368
hopeful Stan Ross,

1:21:54.410 --> 1:21:56.871
who is now just one hit

1:21:54.410 --> 1:21:56.871
from reclaiming

1:21:56.912 --> 1:21:59.665
his cherished

1:21:56.912 --> 1:21:59.665
3,000 career hits.

1:22:01.041 --> 1:22:03.502
But let's talk

1:22:01.041 --> 1:22:03.502
about the name "Mr. 3000."

1:22:03.544 --> 1:22:04.670
Fit just right, doesn't it?

1:22:06.129 --> 1:22:08.424
Why is there so much

1:22:06.129 --> 1:22:08.424
emphasis on the name?

1:22:08.465 --> 1:22:10.300
Why do you care

1:22:08.465 --> 1:22:10.300
so much about it?

1:22:10.342 --> 1:22:12.845
Because it identifies

1:22:10.342 --> 1:22:12.845
greatness.

1:22:12.887 --> 1:22:15.890
When you think of Mr. 3000,

1:22:12.887 --> 1:22:15.890
you think of Mr. Stan Ross,

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:18.517
one of the greatest hitters

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:18.517
straight up and down.

1:22:18.559 --> 1:22:20.436
Who were you

1:22:18.559 --> 1:22:20.436
before Mr. 3000?

1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:22.688
Mr. 3000.

1:22:24.523 --> 1:22:27.984
Just kidding. Before that,

1:22:24.523 --> 1:22:27.984
I was a young black kid

1:22:28.026 --> 1:22:29.194
on the South Side Chicago,

1:22:29.236 --> 1:22:31.280
Stanley Ross,

1:22:29.236 --> 1:22:31.280
just playin' baseball.

1:22:31.321 --> 1:22:34.074
What does Stanley Ross

1:22:31.321 --> 1:22:34.074
think of Mr. 3000?

1:22:34.116 --> 1:22:35.451
He wants his autograph.

1:22:36.410 --> 1:22:38.788
-Really?

1:22:36.410 --> 1:22:38.788
-Really.

1:22:38.829 --> 1:22:42.332
-What about your teammates?

1:22:38.829 --> 1:22:42.332
-They don't need it.

1:22:42.374 --> 1:22:45.628
They get the chance to see

1:22:42.374 --> 1:22:45.628
history in the making.

1:22:45.669 --> 1:22:48.589
Oh, okay.

1:22:45.669 --> 1:22:48.589
So what you're saying is,

1:22:48.631 --> 1:22:51.592
your teammates get to see

1:22:48.631 --> 1:22:51.592
your 3,000th hit,

1:22:51.634 --> 1:22:54.637
but not potentially

1:22:51.634 --> 1:22:54.637
move into third place?

1:22:54.678 --> 1:22:56.263
What I'm saying is,

1:22:54.678 --> 1:22:56.263
thousands of people

1:22:56.305 --> 1:22:59.600
bought tickets this weekend,

1:22:56.305 --> 1:22:59.600
not to see us play

1:22:56.305 --> 1:22:59.600
for third place,

1:22:59.642 --> 1:23:01.602
but to see me get my hit.

1:23:01.644 --> 1:23:03.019
-Really?

1:23:01.644 --> 1:23:03.019
-Damn right.

1:23:03.061 --> 1:23:04.814
It's the same reason

1:23:03.061 --> 1:23:04.814
why everybody else here.

1:23:04.855 --> 1:23:07.190
Same reason why they here,

1:23:04.855 --> 1:23:07.190
same reason why you here,

1:23:07.232 --> 1:23:11.403
-unless you're here

1:23:07.232 --> 1:23:11.403
for something else.

1:23:07.232 --> 1:23:11.403
-Oh, okay.

1:23:11.445 --> 1:23:13.530
You selfish son of a bitch!

1:23:13.572 --> 1:23:15.866
-You don't want that

1:23:13.572 --> 1:23:15.866
on that camera.

1:23:13.572 --> 1:23:15.866
-No, no, I'm fine.

1:23:15.908 --> 1:23:17.367
Because I'm not the one

1:23:15.908 --> 1:23:17.367
who's desperate

1:23:17.409 --> 1:23:19.662
to live his entire life

1:23:17.409 --> 1:23:19.662
in front of the camera.

1:23:19.703 --> 1:23:21.538
Why don't you just go on

1:23:19.703 --> 1:23:21.538
and tell them about Toronto

1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:22.706
and the history

1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:22.706
you left there?

1:23:22.748 --> 1:23:24.166
Oh, come on, Mo.

1:23:22.748 --> 1:23:24.166
That's so old.

1:23:24.207 --> 1:23:27.043
You old.

1:23:24.207 --> 1:23:27.043
Your damn ego is so old!

1:23:27.085 --> 1:23:29.296
It hasn't changed, Stan.

1:23:29.338 --> 1:23:33.884
I mean, how am I supposed

1:23:29.338 --> 1:23:33.884
to even think about

1:23:29.338 --> 1:23:33.884
moving back here

1:23:33.926 --> 1:23:36.052
when you can't even do

1:23:33.926 --> 1:23:36.052
what you say

1:23:33.926 --> 1:23:36.052
you're gonna do?

1:23:36.094 --> 1:23:38.096
Mo, it's only one

1:23:36.094 --> 1:23:38.096
damn practice, baby.

1:23:38.138 --> 1:23:40.683

Is it more than

on a high note.

Get your hit.

1:32:10.524 --> 1:32:12.944
-Pitch to me, damn it!

1:32:12.986 --> 1:32:14.446
Reach out there

1:32:12.986 --> 1:32:14.446
and get it, then.

Those first two deliveries,

1:32:20.118 --> 1:32:22.871
way outside.

1:32:22.912 --> 1:32:24.831
Ross now crowding the plate.

1:32:24.873 --> 1:32:28.001
Two balls, no strikes.

1:32:24.873 --> 1:32:28.001
Nothing close from Norton.

1:33:00.367 --> 1:33:02.618
I could always count on you

1:33:00.367 --> 1:33:02.618
to do your thing, you know?

1:33:03.995 --> 1:33:07.123
You're consistent.

1:33:03.995 --> 1:33:07.123
You're always driven.

1:33:07.165 --> 1:33:08.500
And you're always

1:33:07.165 --> 1:33:08.500
for yourself.

1:33:22.013 --> 1:33:24.974
Ross lays a sacrifice bunt

1:33:25.016 --> 1:33:28.019
up the first-base line,

1:33:25.016 --> 1:33:28.019

1:33:28.061 --> 1:33:30.980
to first base,

1:33:28.061 --> 1:33:30.980
and Ross is out.

1:33:31.022 --> 1:33:32.941
Here comes the play.

First off,

1:35:29.391 --> 1:35:31.351
now all of a sudden,

1:35:31.393 --> 1:35:32.894
the press loves me.

1:35:35.564 --> 1:35:39.150
on the very next ballot.

1:35:39.192 --> 1:35:43.613
And as you can imagine,

1:35:39.192 --> 1:35:43.613
I had plenty

1:35:39.192 --> 1:35:43.613
of people to thank.

1:35:43.655 --> 1:35:48.201
And old Mo.

1:35:43.655 --> 1:35:48.201
She decided to move back

1:35:43.655 --> 1:35:48.201
to Milwaukee after all.

1:35:48.243 --> 1:35:50.620
I know she said

1:35:48.243 --> 1:35:50.620
I'd never get serious,

1:35:50.662 --> 1:35:53.665
but these days,

1:35:50.662 --> 1:35:53.665
I'm even thinking

1:35:50.662 --> 1:35:53.665
about gettin' married.

1:35:53.707 --> 1:35:56.834
You know, so I can have

1:35:53.707 --> 1:35:56.834
that great sex all the time.

1:35:58.670 --> 1:36:03.091
just up and move to Boca.

-"Do your thing."

1:36:05.843 --> 1:36:08.012
-Do your thing.

1:36:08.054 --> 1:36:11.933
like you probably figured.

1:36:11.974 --> 1:36:13.935
But I didn't want to go out

1:36:11.974 --> 1:36:13.935
without leavin' the fellas

1:36:13.976 --> 1:36:16.271

1:36:20.233 --> 1:36:23.027
I couldn't stay

1:36:20.233 --> 1:36:23.027

1:36:53.891 --> 1:36:56.352
