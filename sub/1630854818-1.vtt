01:54.070 --> 01:55.115
- Shh!

02:27.016 --> 02:28.235
- You're up early.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.108
What's all this?

02:33.196 --> 02:35.546
- For the
shower. It's today.

02:36.417 --> 02:37.809
- Isn't
that a little strange?

02:38.810 --> 02:39.681
- What?

02:40.986 --> 02:42.640
- Throwing your own baby shower.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.209
- It's just because I
need it to be perfect.

02:46.383 --> 02:50.648
It's- it's barely anything,
just people from work,

02:51.040 --> 02:52.650
and Caroline's helping.

02:52.824 --> 02:53.738
- Mm-hmm.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.524
- What?
- Nothing.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.092
- Stop making that head.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.748
- You mean that face?

03:03.922 --> 03:05.750
What face should
I make? This face?

03:05.924 --> 03:07.622
This face?
- I hate you.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.101
- This face.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.234
- Stop making fun of me!

03:11.408 --> 03:12.409
You're frightening me!

03:12.583 --> 03:14.803
- Come here, you.

03:14.977 --> 03:15.978
- Are you crazy? Stop!

03:16.152 --> 03:17.458
Careful. I'm gonna break this.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.026
- You're crazy.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.464
Now I can't move.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.336
I can't move.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.037
Much easier.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.735
No, no, no, no.

03:33.909 --> 03:34.997
No.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.609
I can't, I can't move.

03:38.783 --> 03:42.004
I'm like a turtle
on its, on its back.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.005
- You're like a turtle?

03:43.179 --> 03:44.485
- I'm like a turtle-

03:44.659 --> 03:46.704
- A turtle?
- on its back.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.707
- Hi, turtle.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.421
- Oh my god! Would you come
down from there, please?

04:07.595 --> 04:08.552
- I'm fine.

04:08.726 --> 04:09.684
- Come on. I'll help you down.

04:09.858 --> 04:10.902
Yeah, it,

04:11.860 --> 04:13.122
it's done.
- Oh, there it is.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.255
- It's done.
- Thank you.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.519
Okay, what do you think?

04:19.955 --> 04:21.086
- Nice.

04:24.568 --> 04:25.787
Now it's perfect.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.576
- Jo!

04:32.750 --> 04:34.361
This place is amazing!

04:34.796 --> 04:36.580
And it was such a quick
drive from the city.

04:36.754 --> 04:37.973
I can't believe it.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.540
Whoa! Oh my god.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.238
Okay.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.588
- Hi! Hello!

04:44.762 --> 04:46.111
Wow!

04:46.547 --> 04:48.070
Jo.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.245
How have you been?

04:53.728 --> 04:55.077
- There we go.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.948
Anybody else want
some sparkling cider?

04:57.122 --> 04:58.036
- Sure, whatever.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.603
- Sure.

05:01.213 --> 05:04.042
- To Jo. Can you
please stand up for us?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.217
Yes.
- Come on.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.219
- Yes, yes.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.092
To the best boss lady ever.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.790
You are an entrepreneur,

05:12.964 --> 05:14.705
a leader.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.446
You tripled our readership
this year. It's true.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.363
You launched the online
shop, you moved upstate,

05:20.537 --> 05:23.235
you did this insane
renovation, by the way,

05:23.410 --> 05:25.803
all the while answering
every single one

05:25.977 --> 05:27.675
of our readers'
comments personally.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.417
And oh, by the way, you
know, making a human.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.421
We would all hate you if we
did not absolutely love you.

05:34.595 --> 05:35.596
- Ugh!

05:35.770 --> 05:37.075
- I feel just so grateful

05:37.249 --> 05:38.555
to be part of the "Love,
Josephine" family.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.122
- Aw!

05:40.818 --> 05:42.342
- Cheers!

05:42.951 --> 05:44.648
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Oh no!

05:44.822 --> 05:46.215
- I know, I know, I said, I
told myself I was not gonna cry,

05:46.389 --> 05:47.738
but I'm really gonna miss you.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.088
- Oh, thanks, but I'm
not going anywhere.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.830
Nothing's going to be any
different. It's just a baby.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.529
How big are they even, you know?

05:55.703 --> 05:58.227
It's like a little, a little,

05:58.401 --> 06:00.055
a little donut,
a little brioche.

06:01.839 --> 06:02.623
- Cheers.

06:02.797 --> 06:03.624
- Cheers, Jo.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.629
Bye!

07:45.465 --> 07:47.554
- What do you think?

07:47.728 --> 07:49.904
- I think it's a
little small for me.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.296
- But it's your color, no?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.473
- It is my color, but,

07:56.867 --> 07:57.694
this is better, no?

08:03.178 --> 08:04.135
- Oh!

08:05.136 --> 08:08.488
Oh, Spencer, look at this
sweater. It's perfect.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.144
- When's the big day?

08:15.407 --> 08:16.234
- What?

08:16.408 --> 08:17.235
- The baby.

08:18.976 --> 08:21.109
- Oh, uh, any day now.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.632
- Aw!

08:22.806 --> 08:23.807
Are you scared?

08:25.026 --> 08:25.896
- Should I be?

08:29.552 --> 08:31.336
Can I, can I see your baby?

08:33.251 --> 08:34.470
- No.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.167
You never wake a sleeping baby.

08:46.569 --> 08:49.093
- And she stops my hand.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.573
She stops my hand like I'm,

08:50.747 --> 08:53.184
like I'm radioactive
or something.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.927
- Ah.
- Just a sip.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.061
Ah, I wonder that could be.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.889
- Ah, shh. She's just lonely.

09:02.063 --> 09:02.846
- Ah, no!

09:04.848 --> 09:05.632
- Ah.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.944
- Mom, hi.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.380
- Hi, honey. I
don't want to intrude.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.947
I was just driving by.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.514
- No, no,
it's fine. Come on in.

09:18.688 --> 09:19.646
- Oh, no,
no, no, I couldn't.

09:19.820 --> 09:20.821
- Okay.
- Hi.

09:20.995 --> 09:21.996
Hi, Jo.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.214
- Hi!

09:23.388 --> 09:24.607
- I made these for you.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.044
For the cravings.
- Ah.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.045
- Try one.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.310
- What's in it?

09:32.484 --> 09:34.356
- Secret recipe.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.488
Magic bars.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.099
Okay, fine.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.492
Peanut butter, coconut,
butterscotch, chocolate,

09:40.667 --> 09:43.931
crushed maraschino
cherries, and bacon bits.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.194
Who knows? Maybe
they'll induce labor.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.326
- Thank you.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.633
- All right. Well, I'm off.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.550
You two enjoy your
last precious moments.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.249
- Sit down, Doris. Just join us.

09:58.423 --> 10:02.036
- Oh, Jo, I've told
you a million times,

10:02.210 --> 10:03.298
call me Mom.

10:04.908 --> 10:08.695
Speaking of which,
I was thinking,

10:08.869 --> 10:12.089
Grandma doesn't
feel right to me.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.743
Maybe

10:15.397 --> 10:16.572
Gaddy

10:16.746 --> 10:18.530
or Giddy,

10:18.705 --> 10:22.622
Momo or Mimi or Moomoo or
Googoo or Gigi or Geegaw.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.630
- "Can't wait..."

10:50.737 --> 10:55.350
Oh, settle down in there.
Mommy's trying to concentrate.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.577
- God. Are you okay?

11:48.751 --> 11:49.839
- Yeah.

11:50.013 --> 11:50.797
I'm fine.

11:52.015 --> 11:52.799
Just...

11:54.583 --> 11:55.845
Oh.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.673
- Ah, Jesus
- Something's weird.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.153
- Do you think, uh...

11:59.327 --> 12:02.634
- Ah, yeah, I
think it's happening.

12:06.769 --> 12:07.814
- Okay.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.381
- No, please!

12:10.555 --> 12:12.209
- Okay, honey.

12:12.383 --> 12:15.082
- Get the
fuck away from me!

12:21.610 --> 12:22.306
- Five.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.354
Two.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.008
One.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.676
- Everything
okay in here?

14:11.851 --> 14:12.939
- Yes.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.114
- Yeah, of course.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.637
- Have you pooped yet?

14:17.073 --> 14:18.466
- No.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.772
- You can't
leave until you poop.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.356
- Thank you.
- Ah, you too.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.445
- Thank you so
much for everything.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.663
Oh, you too.

15:25.837 --> 15:26.838
- Thank you so much.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.840
- Oh, can we get a photo?

15:29.015 --> 15:30.059
- Yeah, yeah. Photo, photo.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.714
- Will you get one of us?

15:34.237 --> 15:35.499
- This will
be her first photo.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.071
Thank you. Thank you so much.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.333
Thank you, thank you.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.205
Okay, bye.
- Goodbye.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.388
- Wait!

15:54.562 --> 15:56.520
You forgot the placenta!

15:57.957 --> 15:59.480
Better than forgetting
the baby, right?

15:59.654 --> 16:01.177
I thought you wanted to eat it.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.658
- The baby?

16:03.832 --> 16:05.268
- The placenta.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.270
It's all nutrients.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.057
Thank you.

16:11.405 --> 16:12.145
- Good luck.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.242
- Ah.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.331
- Okay,
I think she's in.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.551
You ready?
- Yeah.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.599
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.863
It's just, I wish
my mom were here.

16:44.438 --> 16:45.221
- Okay.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.410
- You can go faster
than two kilometers per hour.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.457
- Well, I have precious cargo.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.285
- I hope fatherhood is
not going to turn you

17:05.459 --> 17:07.156
into a nervous old lady.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.550
- Now, why would
you say that, deary?

17:09.724 --> 17:11.508
I'm your Giddy, your Gaddy,

17:11.682 --> 17:14.903
your Googoo, your Gaga, your-

17:15.077 --> 17:16.035
- Look at the road.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.427
Where are we?

18:00.601 --> 18:01.950
- Home.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.413
- Shh.

18:30.587 --> 18:31.588
Shh.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.343
Shh.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.172
Shh.

18:52.261 --> 18:53.088
Shh.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.441
Shh.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.973
- Well,
this says they like

19:09.148 --> 19:11.324
to suck, swaddle, and swing.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.587
- I don't need
some book, Spencer.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.548
- Well, it says, "Over one
million copies sold, so."

19:18.722 --> 19:20.855
- It's a cliche advice.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.726
I can do this.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.164
I can do this perfectly.

19:27.122 --> 19:27.949
Shh.

19:49.144 --> 19:49.971
Look.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.193
See?

19:58.893 --> 19:59.720
Well.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.169
Fuck!

20:14.343 --> 20:15.736
Who is ringing the doorbell

20:15.910 --> 20:17.259
in the middle of
the fucking night?

20:22.743 --> 20:24.005
- We're here for the gutters.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.965
- Yes, Yes. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.750
Sorry, sorry, I'm here.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.708
Um, I'm Caroline.
I'm the assistant.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.058
We'll set you up
right over there.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.625
Right over there.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.149
- Hi.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.934
- Just the guys here
to work on the house.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.153
We'll be outside. We
won't disturb you at all.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.720
And hey, I think our followers

20:43.894 --> 20:46.157
are still waiting on a baby pic.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.158
- Yeah.

20:48.769 --> 20:49.944
- It's been been a month.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.123
- Oh, uh, I'll get to it.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.820
- I could help you

20:56.994 --> 20:58.213
if it's easier.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.867
- And I also had some-

21:19.278 --> 21:20.104
- Uh, Jo.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.456
Jo, I think she's hungry again.

21:26.023 --> 21:29.810
Shit.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.247
Okay.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.510
Okay.

21:34.684 --> 21:35.468
Shh.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.210
Okay.

21:40.603 --> 21:41.387
Yeah.

21:43.693 --> 21:44.781
Good girl.

21:44.955 --> 21:45.782
Okay.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.742
Here we go.

21:48.916 --> 21:49.960
Here we go.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.484
Okay.

21:51.658 --> 21:55.009
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.184
Here we are.

21:57.707 --> 21:58.578
Hey.

21:58.752 --> 21:59.535
- Look.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.932
Look how perfect she is.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.194
- Yeah.

22:06.368 --> 22:07.848
Well,

22:08.022 --> 22:09.415
you made her.

22:09.589 --> 22:10.720
- We made her.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.425
- Okay.

22:41.055 --> 22:42.578
- Ah! Spencer!

22:42.752 --> 22:43.840
- What's going on, jo?
- Ruby!

22:44.014 --> 22:45.015
- What's going on?

22:47.148 --> 22:50.194
- Of course, I
completely forgot.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.632
I put Ruby up in her
crib hours before.

22:52.806 --> 22:55.939
I mean, the look
on Jo's face was...

22:57.767 --> 23:01.554
- I knew all along. You
were more scared than I was.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.946
He's nervous about everything.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.905
- I am not.

23:05.079 --> 23:08.256
- First-time parents. The
fears are very, very normal.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.390
Oh, one more question,
though, if I may ask.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.043
The bone was who's?

23:13.217 --> 23:15.481
- Spencer's a butcher.
An artisanal butcher.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.221
- I'm not an artisanal...

23:17.396 --> 23:18.832
I'm a butcher.

23:19.006 --> 23:22.052
You know, free range, He
mainly killed no waste.

23:22.226 --> 23:25.229
- Anyway, the point is that
we, we were very tired-

23:25.404 --> 23:27.580
- So we thought that maybe
this was the time to, you know,

23:27.754 --> 23:31.061
come in and just check in
and just get a little help.

23:31.235 --> 23:34.021
- No, we don't, we don't
really need help, but just to-

23:34.195 --> 23:35.414
- Just to
check in, you know.

23:35.588 --> 23:36.763
- Just to check in.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.765
- She cries a lot.

23:38.939 --> 23:42.290
- Well, the good news
is she looks fantastic.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.379
Nothing to worry
about whatsoever.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.163
Babies cry.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.165
It's tough, but,

23:48.731 --> 23:50.124
you know,

23:50.298 --> 23:51.908
wait till she's 18.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.955
That's really hell.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.174
Ah.

23:58.262 --> 23:59.655
Look at you!

23:59.829 --> 24:02.005
Oh, aren't you the
sweetest little thing?

24:03.224 --> 24:05.792
She's adorable.

24:07.924 --> 24:10.753
- I think she looks a
little thin. Is she too thin?

24:10.927 --> 24:13.190
- The doctor said
she's perfectly normal.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.888
- Maybe she's hungry.

24:21.634 --> 24:22.461
Oh!

24:23.766 --> 24:26.639
She's got quite a strong suck.

24:26.813 --> 24:27.640
- Shh.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.599
- You know, people always
say that new babies are cute.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.558
I think they all look like ET.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.255
I mean, some people
thought ET was cute,

24:34.429 --> 24:36.518
but I just thought
he was a creepy alien

24:36.692 --> 24:37.824
that should stay
on his own planet

24:37.998 --> 24:39.869
and leave the rest of us alone.

24:41.828 --> 24:46.615
Anyway, if it's any consolation,
I understand how you feel.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.749
Spencer was a crier.

24:49.923 --> 24:50.924
- Oh, he was?

24:51.098 --> 24:52.839
- Oh yeah.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.275
- Mom, don't talk
her ear off. She's tired.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.319
- I'm fine.
- Thank you, dear.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.278
I'm parched.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.802
- We're just hearing about
how Ruby takes after you.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.325
- Mom, what have
you been telling her about?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.632
- Nothing. You
were a crier, you were.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.199
- I was an infant.
- So?

25:05.373 --> 25:07.767
Take some responsibility
for your own behavior.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.464
- Mom, you
take some responsibility

25:09.638 --> 25:11.466
for your behavior.
- I did take responsibility

25:11.640 --> 25:12.598
for my behavior.
- So why do you blame-

25:12.772 --> 25:13.860
- Why are you arguing?

25:14.034 --> 25:15.514
I told you, this
is .

25:15.688 --> 25:16.558
- I'll go upstairs.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.170
- Uh, will you be okay?

25:20.344 --> 25:21.868
- Will you?

25:28.396 --> 25:29.223
Well.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.333
Shh.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.259
Shh.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.047
Shh.

26:12.135 --> 26:12.962
Shh.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.054
It's okay, Ruby.

26:22.972 --> 26:23.756
It's okay.

26:28.848 --> 26:29.631
Shh.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.231
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:04.405 --> 27:05.232
Ruby!

27:52.235 --> 27:53.019
Ruby?

27:55.238 --> 27:57.414
Baby. You're okay?

27:58.024 --> 27:58.851
- Are you okay?

27:59.025 --> 28:00.113
- Oh, yeah, she's fine.

28:00.287 --> 28:01.897
- Oh my God.
- I didn't,

28:02.071 --> 28:02.898
I didn't see it.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.160
- Oh, look, she's fine.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.032
Oh. People are such idiots.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.337
They completely fly down
the street. It's terrifying.

28:07.511 --> 28:08.948
- I didn't, I didn't see it.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.776
- I know, I know. It's so scary.

28:10.950 --> 28:11.951
But that's why we strap them in.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.779
- You sure, you sure she's fine?

28:13.953 --> 28:16.259
- Yeah, she, l-
look at her. She's beautiful.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.218
Oh.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.702
- Wait, I, I saw you
at the baby store.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.923
- That's right, yes,
I do remember you. Hi.

28:28.924 --> 28:29.795
- I had the baby.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.579
- Well, congratulations.

28:31.753 --> 28:32.580
- Thank you.

28:33.537 --> 28:34.364
It's great.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.368
It, it really, it really is.

28:51.251 --> 28:52.078
- Hey, guys.

28:52.252 --> 28:52.861
- Hey.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.082
- I want you guys to meet, um...

28:57.866 --> 28:59.912
Oh my god, I didn't even
catch your name. I'm so sorry.

29:00.086 --> 29:00.913
- Jo.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.697
- This is Jo, you guys.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.481
- I know you.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.135
"Love, Josephine."

29:06.309 --> 29:07.658
- The French girl style.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.661
The cheese souffle that
broke the internet.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.839
- Oh my god! I cannot
believe that's you.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.102
I'm such a fan. You're amazing.

29:16.276 --> 29:19.061
I tried to make your
souffle for like a month.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.237
- Oh, it's easy.
It's easy, truly.

29:21.411 --> 29:22.543
- "It's easy, truly."

29:23.892 --> 29:26.242
- I know. She's so chic, right?

29:26.416 --> 29:27.853
- I haven't seen
your baby online yet.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.463
Maybe I missed it?

29:29.637 --> 29:32.161
- No, I haven't, I
haven't posted yet.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.905
It's just, uh, I'm not
sure with the babies.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.603
How do you do anything?

29:39.778 --> 29:40.909
Ruby cries

29:41.780 --> 29:43.085
a lot.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.348
And I know, I know
babies cry. I know that.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.481
But sometime it's just,

29:47.655 --> 29:49.700
it's too much, no?

29:49.875 --> 29:52.486
And you guys look so happy

29:52.660 --> 29:55.445
and relaxed and rested,

29:56.925 --> 29:59.841
and your, your babies
are, are so quiet.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.888
They don't even cry.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.193
What's your secret?

30:04.367 --> 30:05.151
I mean...

30:07.109 --> 30:08.981
- Trust your instincts.

30:55.418 --> 30:58.117
- I'm not sure about the outfit.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.901
- I don't think we should go.

31:00.902 --> 31:01.729
- Come on.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.689
It's just dinner.
Ruby will be fine.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.953
- It's too much for your mother.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.433
- Well, she raised me, right?

31:10.607 --> 31:11.957
Look how great I turned out.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.353
It's nice for her
to feel needed.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.053
Besides, are we never
gonna have dinner again

31:21.227 --> 31:22.489
alone for the rest of our lives?

31:22.663 --> 31:23.838
- That was my plan?

31:28.843 --> 31:29.800
- We need this.

31:40.289 --> 31:42.248
- Oh, yes, you are.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.427
Oh, she smiled at me.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.299
Has she smiled before?

31:52.040 --> 31:54.303
Oh, you had your first smile.

31:54.477 --> 31:57.132
Ruby, you're so
smart. She's so smart.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.004
- I missed it.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.527
- Okay, well, there's
gonna be plenty of chances

32:00.701 --> 32:02.790
to see her smile
and frown and cry

32:02.964 --> 32:06.402
and roll her eyes in complete
disgust at her idiot parents.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.709
So come. We're gonna be late.

32:08.883 --> 32:09.666
Thanks, Mom.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.277
- Okay.

32:11.451 --> 32:12.800
- The, the, the
milk is in the fridge.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.367
Just warm it up and
make sure to test it.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.196
- We'll be fine. Just
go on, you lovebirds.

32:48.792 --> 32:52.274
- You were right.
This is, this is nice.

32:52.448 --> 32:56.017
- You see? Every now and
again, I have a good idea.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.411
Not often. Like once a year.

32:59.716 --> 33:00.500
On leap years.

33:09.813 --> 33:10.640
Hey, what's up?

33:13.687 --> 33:16.907
- I kind of feel like
I'm, I'm disappearing.

33:20.433 --> 33:21.216
- Um...

33:22.783 --> 33:24.785
Well, this is temporary.

33:24.959 --> 33:27.831
You know, pretty soon,
you'll be back to work,

33:28.006 --> 33:31.400
photo shoots of diapers,
baby food sponsorships.

33:31.574 --> 33:34.708
You'll be moving a mile
a minute. Trust me.

33:34.882 --> 33:36.188
Everyone goes through this.

33:36.362 --> 33:37.189
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.888
You know, Freddy from work,
after his kid was born,

33:41.062 --> 33:42.629
his wife got so freaked out,

33:42.803 --> 33:44.935
she just picked lint
off the carpet all day.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.286
Uh-huh, and Jim, Jim's
wife started buying

33:47.460 --> 33:50.637
all kinds of tiny, crazy
cat figurines online.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.726
- I haven't bought one tiny cat.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.641
- I know.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.948
Because you're gonna
be a great mom.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.082
- You have puke on your jacket.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.257
- I have what on my jacket?

34:02.431 --> 34:03.432
- You have puke on your jacket.

34:03.606 --> 34:04.390
- I have what on my jacket?

34:04.564 --> 34:05.521
- Wait, I-

34:05.695 --> 34:07.393
- What are you doing?

34:07.567 --> 34:09.090
- Give it to me.
- No, no.

34:09.264 --> 34:09.873
- Just put a little bit of-
- Control freak.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.832
No. I'll get it.

34:12.963 --> 34:13.964
Love you.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.909
- Sweet, sweet Ruby.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.654
Ruby.

34:51.828 --> 34:55.702
Ruby.

34:55.876 --> 34:57.791
Ruby.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.670
- Pick up the fucking.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.542
Doris, pick up
the fucking phone!

35:09.716 --> 35:10.978
Sorry, I I...

35:11.152 --> 35:12.762
- Whoa, whoa, what's happening?

35:12.936 --> 35:15.200
- The monitor, the moni-

35:15.374 --> 35:16.723
It's probably nothing-
- Jo, what's going on?

35:16.897 --> 35:18.594
- but I just have
to go check on Ruby.

35:18.768 --> 35:19.552
Give me the keys to the car.
- What are you talking-

35:19.726 --> 35:21.119
- The key to the car!

35:21.293 --> 35:22.555
- Jesus.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.167
- Oh my god!
- Out of my way!

35:26.341 --> 35:27.255
- I'm so sorry.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.127
Jo, wait!

35:33.870 --> 35:35.307
- It's okay. It was our
first time away from her.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.612
We'll get better at it.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.704
- What do you think it was?

35:43.706 --> 35:46.666
- You know, I think it's
what my mom said it was.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.059
I think she was, um,
putting a blanket on Ruby,

35:49.234 --> 35:51.671
and she kicked over the iPad.

35:51.845 --> 35:54.674
- But I heard whispering.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.894
- Yeah, it's just my
mom whispering to Ruby.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.115
- What was she telling her?

36:04.031 --> 36:04.858
- Um...

36:06.425 --> 36:07.774
"Sleep tight," probably.

36:12.692 --> 36:13.519
- I'm...

36:15.042 --> 36:15.956
I'm okay now.

36:16.130 --> 36:16.957
- I know.

36:18.698 --> 36:19.525
I know.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.703
- I'm just gonna
go check on Ruby.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.096
Okay?

36:45.986 --> 36:47.292
Oh, sorry, Ruby.

36:48.858 --> 36:49.729
It's okay.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.165
It's just

36:51.339 --> 36:52.166
Mommy.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.867
Shh.

36:58.041 --> 37:00.522
I won't leave you
again, I promise.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.570
Okay? I won't leave you again.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.224
I won't

37:07.442 --> 37:09.183
ever leave you again.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.098
Never.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.194
Ow!

37:33.860 --> 37:34.730
You bit me.

37:46.568 --> 37:50.398
- Impalement,
strangulation, suffocation.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.139
You sure that thing's secure?

37:54.359 --> 37:58.972
I would not want that to fall
on her. Crush her like a bug.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.975
I don't love the look at
these corners, and obviously,

38:02.149 --> 38:04.194
you're gonna need to get
this construction cleaned up.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.893
- We are close. I dunno
what's taking them so long.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.373
- Total death trap.

38:08.547 --> 38:09.896
- I know she's a little young

38:10.070 --> 38:11.593
to worry about
all this now, but-

38:11.767 --> 38:13.508
- Never too early
to start baby proofing.

38:13.682 --> 38:16.381
- Yeah, and she,
she's very advanced.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.034
She, she already has teeth.

38:19.949 --> 38:23.779
Well, uh, I, I really want
our home to be safe from her.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.128
- Safe for her.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.087
- Yeah.

38:30.395 --> 38:31.787
What did I say?

38:31.961 --> 38:34.268
- It's
okay, I get it.

38:34.442 --> 38:35.356
We had twins.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.359
They almost killed me.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.235
- Whoa! Come on, slowpoke!

40:15.195 --> 40:16.762
- Oh, fuck, fuck!

40:16.936 --> 40:17.806
Ruby!

40:17.980 --> 40:19.417
I'm sorry baby.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.114
- Oh my god, Runaway
Ralph! Here you go.

40:21.288 --> 40:22.463
- Oh, oh, thank you.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.465
- You okay?
- God!

40:29.688 --> 40:31.385
I need, I need a cigarette.

40:31.559 --> 40:34.214
- Don't worry. It
gets so much easier, I promise.

40:34.388 --> 40:36.346
- Running or the baby?

40:36.999 --> 40:39.698
- Oh, you poor thing. Is
Ruby still crying a lot?

40:39.872 --> 40:42.004
- Yeah, it's, it's strange, she,

40:42.178 --> 40:46.008
she doesn't do it around other
people, but she, she cries.

40:46.182 --> 40:47.575
- It's classic, right?

40:49.098 --> 40:49.882
- Do you...

40:52.841 --> 40:56.323
Do you ever feel like you're
baby's angry with you?

40:57.890 --> 40:59.805
- I mean, when I take
more than five seconds

40:59.979 --> 41:01.284
to do her bidding for her, yes.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.286
She's completely
pissed all of the time.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.768
- I mean more like
punishing you.

41:08.988 --> 41:10.163
- Punishing me for what?

41:14.036 --> 41:15.211
- I don't, I don't know.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.737
- You know what I think?

41:20.608 --> 41:22.784
I think that you really
need to go out and, like,

41:22.958 --> 41:25.004
dance and get your
old self back.

41:25.178 --> 41:26.919
We're actually all going
out for mom drinks later,

41:27.093 --> 41:28.094
and I swear it's not

41:28.268 --> 41:29.182
as terrible as it sounds.

41:29.356 --> 41:30.705
- No, I can't.

41:30.879 --> 41:32.533
That's exactly what
makes her angry.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.143
- Where are you going Jo?

41:34.317 --> 41:37.016
- Home. I, I need
to focus on home.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.452
I'll see you around.

42:31.157 --> 42:32.462
- Jo.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.464
- I'm busy, Caroline.
Can't you see?

42:34.639 --> 42:36.554
- Sorry, it's just that, um,

42:37.859 --> 42:38.773
Ruby's crying.

42:40.732 --> 42:41.646
- Babies cry.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.085
- She's been crying
for over an hour.

42:48.783 --> 42:51.481
- Fine.

42:51.656 --> 42:53.396
- I'll get her, okay?

42:54.528 --> 42:55.964
Fine, Ruby.

42:56.138 --> 42:58.445
If that's what you
want, I'm coming.

43:00.534 --> 43:04.364
I am not going to let you win.

43:04.538 --> 43:06.279
I am not going

43:06.453 --> 43:08.411
to let you win.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.848
Do you hear me?

43:10.979 --> 43:14.026
I'm not gonna let you win, Ruby.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.419
I'm not gonna let you win.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.421
I'm not gonna let you win!

43:24.993 --> 43:26.952
- Hey.

43:27.126 --> 43:28.867
What's the occasion?

43:29.041 --> 43:30.999
- Nothing. I cooked.

43:31.173 --> 43:33.306
- What is it?
- A surprise.

43:36.352 --> 43:37.615
- Where's Ruby?

43:41.183 --> 43:42.010
Jo?

43:50.976 --> 43:52.542
Jo, wait, please. Come on, wait.

43:52.717 --> 43:55.067
- Do you really think I'm crazy?

43:55.241 --> 43:59.027
- No, I don't. I
don't think you're crazy.

44:00.420 --> 44:01.987
Look, this is hard on me,
too. I'm fucking exhausted.

44:02.161 --> 44:04.032
- Oh, I'm
sorry, but did,

44:04.206 --> 44:07.949
did you make an entire
person inside your own body?

44:09.472 --> 44:12.432
Don't you understand
that she's killing me?

44:12.606 --> 44:15.217
- And I'm saying
that I wanna help.

44:19.700 --> 44:20.875
I'll go.
- I'm fine.

44:21.049 --> 44:23.443
- No. Let me, just this once.

44:24.966 --> 44:27.360
- Okay. You see how you do.

44:27.534 --> 44:28.361
Go.

44:46.858 --> 44:49.774
Okay, Ruby.

45:35.384 --> 45:36.690
- Okay, uh...

45:36.864 --> 45:39.127
- I'm going out. You're
so good with Ruby.

45:39.301 --> 45:40.999
You handle her for a night.

45:41.173 --> 45:42.783
- Okay, well, can you tell
me where you're going.

45:42.957 --> 45:45.046
- Out, I said.

45:45.568 --> 45:47.527
- Jo, I, I don't think
you should go out.

45:47.701 --> 45:49.181
- Why not?

45:49.355 --> 45:51.487
Afraid to be alone with her?

45:51.661 --> 45:53.054
- I'm dying to be
alone with her.

45:53.228 --> 45:55.448
- So then, what's
the problem, hmm?

45:55.622 --> 45:58.451
Dinner's on the stove, but you
already know that, I think.

45:58.625 --> 46:01.367
There is pumped milk in the
fridge for when Ruby's hungry.

46:01.541 --> 46:03.369
But be careful
when you feed her.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.371
She bites.

46:32.528 --> 46:34.400
- Ruby.

46:38.099 --> 46:39.057
- You came!

46:41.886 --> 46:42.712
- Yeah.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.018
- Hi!

46:45.063 --> 46:46.629
- I needed to get out.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.936
- Your hair looks so cute.

46:49.110 --> 46:50.416
- It's falling out.

46:51.547 --> 46:52.766
- Hormones are a bitch.

46:56.509 --> 46:57.466
- Ruby.

47:00.513 --> 47:01.340
- Jo!

47:03.211 --> 47:05.953
Is it true that in France
the government pays for you

47:06.127 --> 47:08.173
to rehab your vagina
after you have a baby?

47:08.347 --> 47:09.870
- Oh, yes.

47:10.044 --> 47:12.394
We, we have physical
therapy, yes.

47:12.568 --> 47:14.614
- Tell us about your
childcare policies,

47:14.788 --> 47:16.529
because they're
incredible, right?

47:16.703 --> 47:20.359
- Yes, yeah, we have, uh,
we do have childcare, yes.

47:20.533 --> 47:21.839
- This country-
- I can't even imagine.

47:22.013 --> 47:23.797
- Hey! This country's bullshit.

47:23.971 --> 47:24.972
- Yeah.
- Everyone, note it.

47:25.146 --> 47:26.452
- I thought you all, I mean,

47:26.626 --> 47:28.193
you seem like you're
doing so well.

47:28.367 --> 47:30.412
- Yeah,
we're miserable.

47:30.586 --> 47:32.588
We are zombies.

47:32.762 --> 47:34.068
We are furious.

47:34.242 --> 47:35.026
- Uh-huh.

47:36.679 --> 47:38.638
- Honestly, the thing
that really helped me

47:38.812 --> 47:41.510
through all of this
was eating my placenta.

47:41.684 --> 47:42.947
I made it into a bolognese.

47:44.600 --> 47:45.906
- You're scaring her!

47:46.080 --> 47:46.907
- I'm not!

47:47.081 --> 47:47.995
- I forgot mine.

47:48.169 --> 47:49.518
- Let's dance!

47:49.692 --> 47:51.433
- Mine is still
in the freezer.

48:07.319 --> 48:08.450
- Pump and dump, baby!

48:08.624 --> 48:09.669
- Yeah! Whoo!

48:51.972 --> 48:52.799
- Okay.

49:06.465 --> 49:07.248
I can't.

49:08.771 --> 49:12.253
Give me a minute. Give
me a minute, please.

49:23.525 --> 49:24.744
- What is that?

49:28.530 --> 49:29.923
- It's Ruby.

49:49.073 --> 49:51.075
- Hey, Jo, it's Shelly.

49:51.249 --> 49:52.990
Where were you tonight?

49:53.164 --> 49:54.730
I thought, um, you were
gonna come to mom drinks.

49:54.904 --> 49:55.993
We really missed you.

49:57.255 --> 50:00.214
- Fuck.

50:17.666 --> 50:19.059
- Where were you?

50:19.233 --> 50:21.018
- I fell asleep
in a parking lot.

50:22.889 --> 50:26.197
Yeah, I wanted to go to a
bar to have a drink, and I,

50:26.371 --> 50:28.808
I fell asleep before
I even came inside.

50:30.288 --> 50:33.291
I slept for the
first time in ages.

50:35.554 --> 50:37.164
- You couldn't even call?

50:37.338 --> 50:38.992
- I fell asleep, like I said.

50:42.822 --> 50:43.866
Where's Ruby?

50:44.041 --> 50:45.433
- She's upstairs in her crib.

50:45.607 --> 50:47.348
She's fine. Don't go
up there and wake her.

50:47.522 --> 50:49.350
We actually had a really
nice night together.

50:49.524 --> 50:50.308
- Good.

50:51.439 --> 50:52.658
I'm happy for you.

50:52.832 --> 50:53.659
- Yeah.

50:55.487 --> 50:56.749
Well, it was nice to get
some time with her, finally.

50:56.923 --> 50:58.359
- Okay, well, I shouldn't,

50:58.533 --> 50:59.882
I shouldn't have come
back at all, then.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.580
- Yeah, okay, that's
not what I meant.

51:03.364 --> 51:05.236
I'm going to work. Someone
around here has to.

51:14.854 --> 51:16.638
- This is typical man.

51:16.812 --> 51:19.206
You like to spend time
with her on your terms,

51:19.380 --> 51:21.078
but then you leave whenever
it becomes inconvenient.

51:21.252 --> 51:22.601
- All I said was
it was nice, okay?

51:22.775 --> 51:24.168
You're the one who
left all night.

51:24.342 --> 51:26.387
- I got tired, okay? I
made a mistake one time.

51:26.561 --> 51:27.649
- Was it?

51:27.823 --> 51:28.650
A mistake?

51:30.174 --> 51:30.957
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

51:31.131 --> 51:32.132
You seem pretty unhappy.

51:32.306 --> 51:33.090
- I love her.

51:35.396 --> 51:36.441
You don't believe me?

51:37.268 --> 51:39.400
Hey, do not walk away
from me, Spencer!

51:39.574 --> 51:40.836
Talk to me!

51:41.010 --> 51:42.360
- Great. You
fucking woke her up!

51:42.534 --> 51:43.317
- Ah!

51:44.797 --> 51:47.234
It's okay, Ruby, I
heard you. Just stop.

51:53.806 --> 51:58.202
There you go.

51:58.376 --> 51:59.159
Oh.

52:02.684 --> 52:03.511
Sorry.

52:04.512 --> 52:05.774
Sorry, baby.

52:05.948 --> 52:06.775
I'm sorry.

52:18.831 --> 52:22.008
- Well, the great news
is she's grabbing.

52:22.182 --> 52:24.010
That's a big milestone.

52:24.184 --> 52:26.186
It's time to get one
of those activity gyms

52:26.360 --> 52:27.535
so that she can grab things that

52:27.709 --> 52:29.407
don't cause you bodily harm.

52:29.581 --> 52:32.192
- So there's nothing
wrong w- with her?

52:32.366 --> 52:33.672
- She's perfectly fine.

52:33.846 --> 52:36.109
- Uh, I'm sure you
saw, but she has teeth.

52:36.849 --> 52:38.851
- Well, it's a little
early for that,

52:39.025 --> 52:40.548
but all babies are different.

52:40.722 --> 52:43.160
- And she she doesn't
seem angry to you?

52:46.424 --> 52:47.425
- What about?

52:47.599 --> 52:50.036
- No, nothing, I just, I mean...

52:51.559 --> 52:54.475
I would understand if
she's disappointed.

52:54.649 --> 52:56.825
- In what? She's a baby.

52:58.392 --> 52:59.959
She's not old enough
to be disappointed.

53:03.005 --> 53:04.224
Um...

53:06.531 --> 53:07.706
I'm gonna be right back.

53:09.098 --> 53:10.448
- Wait, w- where are you going?

53:10.622 --> 53:13.451
- Turns out she's
due for some shots.

53:13.625 --> 53:15.104
This will only take a minute.

53:52.359 --> 53:55.710
- "What is your baby
trying to tell you?"

53:57.234 --> 53:58.800
"What is your baby
trying to tell you?"

53:58.974 --> 54:02.151
- Oh, she's
completely lost her marbles.

54:02.326 --> 54:04.284
I worry that she
might .

54:12.161 --> 54:15.208
- Hey, it's okay,
it's okay. Shh.

54:16.905 --> 54:18.646
- Hey, hey,
you can't leave!

54:18.820 --> 54:21.258
- Uh, it's, it's not a good
time, really. We'll come back.

54:35.576 --> 54:36.969
I was wrong.

54:37.143 --> 54:38.318
- Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing here?

54:38.492 --> 54:39.580
- About everything.
- Jesus.

54:39.754 --> 54:41.103
Ah, I'm sorry.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.584
- Shh.
- She's not angry with me.

54:43.758 --> 54:45.934
Of course she's not
angry. She's not.

54:46.108 --> 54:49.373
That was completely insane.
There's nothing wrong with her.

54:49.547 --> 54:51.375
She's, she's not
trying to hurt me.

54:51.549 --> 54:52.941
- Yeah.
- She,

54:53.115 --> 54:55.248
she's trying to
tell me something.

54:57.032 --> 55:00.862
It makes sense, you know,
understanding your baby's cues.

55:01.036 --> 55:04.039
The, the, the
crying, the grabbing.

55:05.606 --> 55:08.870
She's trying desperately
to communicate with us,

55:09.044 --> 55:10.655
and the only way she can-

55:10.829 --> 55:12.874
- So what is she
trying to communicate?

55:14.049 --> 55:15.399
- I don't know.

55:15.573 --> 55:16.704
I don't know.
- Uh-huh?

55:18.271 --> 55:20.926
- I think she, she may
be trying to warn us.

55:22.057 --> 55:23.232
- What did the doctor say?

55:25.060 --> 55:27.454
- I didn't tell him about this.
He'll just think I'm crazy.

55:29.587 --> 55:31.328
- Yeah, I'm gonna
take you home, Jo.

55:32.894 --> 55:35.506
Uh, I don't want
her here, and, uh,

55:37.334 --> 55:39.640
when we, when we get back,
maybe we can figure this out,

55:39.814 --> 55:41.773
and maybe you can get
a little rest, hmm?

55:43.992 --> 55:45.690
- I don't need to rest.

55:45.864 --> 55:47.779
- Well, you can't figure this
out when you're exhausted.

55:47.953 --> 55:48.736
- I'm not.

55:50.956 --> 55:52.305
- Hey, look at me.

55:54.525 --> 55:55.352
I love you.

55:56.918 --> 55:57.702
- I love you too.

56:01.053 --> 56:01.880
- Okay.

56:05.623 --> 56:06.711
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

56:06.885 --> 56:09.148
It's okay. Good girl.

56:09.322 --> 56:12.760
Good girl.

56:27.122 --> 56:28.559
- Hi.

56:28.733 --> 56:30.735
I thought I would
bring you some tea.

56:32.737 --> 56:35.609
- Spencer shouldn't have
bothered you, really.

56:36.915 --> 56:38.699
I can take care of Ruby myself.

56:40.614 --> 56:43.225
- Ruby isn't the only one
who needs taking care of.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.226
- Thanks.

56:47.926 --> 56:49.710
- Oh, that's a classic.

56:49.884 --> 56:52.887
- Yeah, I, I didn't think
I'd need these books, but-

56:53.061 --> 56:54.323
- I know.

56:54.498 --> 56:55.847
It's hell.

56:56.021 --> 56:56.848
- What?

56:58.415 --> 57:00.982
- Well, I told you about
when Spencer was a baby.

57:01.156 --> 57:02.680
- Yes. You said he was a crier.

57:02.854 --> 57:04.725
- Oh, much worse than that.

57:04.899 --> 57:07.772
You know, this was back in my
day. Men didn't do anything.

57:07.946 --> 57:12.124
I was all alone, and
everybody kept saying,

57:12.298 --> 57:16.258
wasn't I so happy, and wasn't
my baby a miraculous thing,

57:16.433 --> 57:17.259
and I,

57:18.217 --> 57:19.261
I felt so

57:20.785 --> 57:23.352
guilty because of
course I loved him,

57:24.397 --> 57:25.920
but also,

57:29.924 --> 57:30.795
I hated him.

57:32.797 --> 57:34.799
I would dream about
all the terrible things

57:34.973 --> 57:36.757
that could happen to him,

57:36.931 --> 57:37.889
and at first I thought it
was because I was scared.

57:38.063 --> 57:40.065
I mean, all moms are scared.

57:42.110 --> 57:43.372
But then I realized

57:46.550 --> 57:47.725
I

57:47.899 --> 57:48.769
wished for it.

57:53.165 --> 57:53.992
I did.

57:56.690 --> 57:59.563
And one night, Spencer's
father was on another

58:01.390 --> 58:03.610
business trip, and Spencer
was crying and crying,

58:03.784 --> 58:06.047
and I tried everything,
but nothing worked.

58:07.222 --> 58:08.659
And I was hot.

58:10.399 --> 58:13.968
Summer. It was dark outside,
middle of the night.

58:15.100 --> 58:16.405
And I,

58:16.580 --> 58:17.842
I remember I just,

58:20.105 --> 58:22.324
I prayed to God
for someone to come

58:22.499 --> 58:24.979
and just take this
baby away from me

58:25.153 --> 58:28.940
so that I could go back
to being who I was before.

58:29.114 --> 58:30.332
But also, I knew,

58:32.291 --> 58:34.075
I knew that wasn't gonna happen.

58:34.249 --> 58:35.076
I was,

58:36.164 --> 58:37.252
I was trapped.

58:41.169 --> 58:42.823
I put Spencer in his crib,

58:42.997 --> 58:45.391
and he was crying and crying
and crying and crying,

58:45.565 --> 58:49.308
like a hammer, like,
um, in my head,

58:49.482 --> 58:50.309
and I,

58:52.398 --> 58:57.316
I went down into the kitchen
and I got our sharpest knife.

58:58.273 --> 58:58.926
- To kill yourself?

58:59.100 --> 58:59.884
- To kill him.

59:02.756 --> 59:04.236
I went back upstairs,

59:05.498 --> 59:06.847
and

59:07.021 --> 59:08.762
he was

59:08.936 --> 59:09.720
just-

59:11.112 --> 59:12.200
- Stop.

59:12.374 --> 59:13.201
Just stop.

59:14.725 --> 59:17.075
- Well, obviously,
I came to my senses.

59:17.249 --> 59:18.729
I mean, I didn't do anything.

59:18.903 --> 59:20.165
- You have to stop.

59:22.384 --> 59:23.821
- Yes, and that's the problem.

59:25.605 --> 59:28.042
We can't talk about these
things, not even to each other.

59:28.216 --> 59:31.568
We can't admit it. We
can't even look at it.

59:34.396 --> 59:35.223
And so

59:38.879 --> 59:40.272
it grows stronger.

1:00:07.473 --> 1:00:09.170
- Ruby.

1:00:09.344 --> 1:00:13.348
- Hey, hey, um, my mom's
staying over, so you can...

1:00:49.384 --> 1:00:50.559
- Voila.

1:00:50.734 --> 1:00:52.431
- I'm not that hungry.

1:00:52.605 --> 1:00:56.478
- Well, it's croissant, but
we have to keep you fed.

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:58.959
Oh, and your friend
dropped by, Shelly.

1:00:59.133 --> 1:01:01.266
She dropped off a loaf cake.

1:01:02.746 --> 1:01:04.661
You're looking more
rested already.

1:01:04.835 --> 1:01:07.141
- I didn't hear Ruby
wake up in the night.

1:01:07.315 --> 1:01:08.447
I guess she slept through.

1:01:08.621 --> 1:01:11.058
- Good job, Ruby!

1:01:12.190 --> 1:01:13.844
- You didn't hear her, did you?

1:01:14.758 --> 1:01:16.324
- Not a a peep.

1:01:16.498 --> 1:01:18.500
Of course, I'm downstairs
on the sofa, so.

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:20.024
Not that I'm complaining.

1:01:20.198 --> 1:01:23.027
I just get a little
twinge in my back.

1:01:23.201 --> 1:01:24.376
I know the guest
room isn't finished,

1:01:24.550 --> 1:01:27.161
but I would love a

1:01:27.335 --> 1:01:28.772
firmer mattress.

1:01:28.946 --> 1:01:30.164
- I was thinking how
helpful you've been

1:01:30.338 --> 1:01:32.950
that first night
Spencer and I went out.

1:01:33.124 --> 1:01:34.995
- I know, you were so worried.

1:01:35.169 --> 1:01:37.432
- What was in those magic bars?

1:01:38.651 --> 1:01:40.653
I went into labor
at the very night.

1:01:41.219 --> 1:01:42.916
- I hope you don't think-

1:01:43.090 --> 1:01:46.093
- Oh, what would I think? Just
a typical nervous mom, no?

1:01:46.267 --> 1:01:50.576
- I promise you,
there's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

1:01:50.750 --> 1:01:53.318
I keep a very watchful eye.

1:01:54.667 --> 1:01:55.755
- So do I.

1:01:59.803 --> 1:02:01.152
- Jo, the guys are finally
done with the gutters,

1:02:01.326 --> 1:02:03.371
if you wanna go give
it a quick look.

1:02:03.545 --> 1:02:05.069
- I'll watch Ruby.

1:02:05.243 --> 1:02:06.592
- I'll be back in two minutes.

1:02:06.766 --> 1:02:08.333
Don't take her out of the swing.

1:02:21.346 --> 1:02:22.521
Do you want me to go up there?

1:02:22.695 --> 1:02:24.653
- No, no, no, I just-

1:02:24.828 --> 1:02:25.829
Oh my god!
- Sorry.

1:02:26.003 --> 1:02:27.308
- That was a complete accident.

1:02:27.482 --> 1:02:29.658
What is wrong with you idiots?

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:31.530
- Is everything okay?

1:02:31.704 --> 1:02:34.315
- All is well. I'll just
take Ruby out for a walk.

1:02:37.014 --> 1:02:37.971
- It's okay.

1:02:39.712 --> 1:02:41.061
Let her go.

1:02:48.199 --> 1:02:49.635
- Hey,
this is Spencer.

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:52.377
I can't make him on
the phone right now.

1:02:54.248 --> 1:02:55.510
- Shelly.

1:02:55.684 --> 1:02:57.164
Shelly!

1:02:57.338 --> 1:02:58.165
Oh god.

1:02:59.819 --> 1:03:01.038
- Are you okay?

1:03:02.213 --> 1:03:03.605
What is going on?

1:03:05.172 --> 1:03:07.131
- Just close, close the
door. Close it quickly.

1:03:07.305 --> 1:03:08.959
They may be following me.

1:03:09.133 --> 1:03:10.351
Oh fuck.
- Shit.

1:03:10.525 --> 1:03:12.658
Is this about Spencer? Shit!

1:03:12.832 --> 1:03:14.529
Did he find out?

1:03:14.703 --> 1:03:16.967
Jo, please tell me
you didn't tell him.

1:03:18.229 --> 1:03:19.404
- Tell him what?

1:03:19.578 --> 1:03:20.622
- Tell him what?

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:22.450
Were you too drunk to remember,

1:03:22.624 --> 1:03:24.670
or was it just
that insignificant?

1:03:24.844 --> 1:03:26.324
- I thought that was a dream.

1:03:27.281 --> 1:03:28.935
It was not a dream?

1:03:29.109 --> 1:03:31.677
- A dream? Should I be
taking that as a compliment?

1:03:31.851 --> 1:03:33.635
I texted you and texted you,

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:35.507
and then I baked you a loaf
cake and I leave you a card,

1:03:35.681 --> 1:03:37.944
and you just
completely ghosted me.

1:03:38.118 --> 1:03:39.424
- I'm sorry, I didn't-
- And it's like,

1:03:39.598 --> 1:03:41.034
you know what, I get
it, because I'm married.

1:03:41.208 --> 1:03:43.167
I don't wanna blow up my
life over this, either.

1:03:43.341 --> 1:03:45.082
But you're French. I thought
we could be French about it.

1:03:45.256 --> 1:03:47.954
Like, what's the big
fucking deal? Fuck!

1:03:48.128 --> 1:03:50.304
I'm just in a really, like,
vulnerable place right now

1:03:50.478 --> 1:03:52.350
with my sexuality
and my femininity,

1:03:52.524 --> 1:03:54.831
and I feel like fucking
shit all the time,

1:03:55.005 --> 1:03:56.441
and you doing that to me
makes me feel even worse,

1:03:56.615 --> 1:03:58.312
and I don't even have
anyone I can talk to

1:03:58.486 --> 1:04:00.358
about how I'm feeling right now.

1:04:00.532 --> 1:04:03.622
- I do really wanna talk about
this. I really apologize.

1:04:03.796 --> 1:04:06.407
But I need to make a
quick, quick phone call.

1:04:08.279 --> 1:04:10.934
- Seriously? Just be quiet,
because my baby's asleep.

1:04:12.718 --> 1:04:14.024
- Hey,
this is Spencer.

1:04:14.198 --> 1:04:15.373
I can't make it to
the phone right now,

1:04:15.547 --> 1:04:16.853
so leave your message
after the beep.

1:04:17.027 --> 1:04:19.333
- Hey, it's me. I
need to talk to you.

1:04:19.507 --> 1:04:22.293
R- Ruby is in danger.
I am in danger.

1:04:22.467 --> 1:04:26.863
Please just, just send
everyone away, and let us talk.

1:05:10.515 --> 1:05:11.385
Can I see?

1:05:11.559 --> 1:05:12.604
- No.

1:05:12.778 --> 1:05:13.779
- What's your secret?

1:05:13.953 --> 1:05:16.913
- Just your instincts.

1:05:17.087 --> 1:05:18.958
- There were no babies.

1:05:21.178 --> 1:05:24.007
There were never any babies.

1:06:00.217 --> 1:06:02.088
What are you doing in there?

1:06:02.262 --> 1:06:03.698
- Nothing.

1:06:03.872 --> 1:06:05.178
Nothing, I just...

1:06:06.614 --> 1:06:07.441
Just

1:06:08.529 --> 1:06:10.488
give me my baby.

1:06:11.010 --> 1:06:13.404
- Oh my god, she's so perfect.

1:06:14.361 --> 1:06:18.365
She's really just a
perfect little angel, Jo.

1:06:20.454 --> 1:06:22.282
- Why did you come up to me

1:06:22.456 --> 1:06:25.720
that first day at
the baby store?

1:06:25.894 --> 1:06:27.592
- What are you talking about?

1:06:27.766 --> 1:06:29.246
- I was a good target, huh?

1:06:29.420 --> 1:06:32.031
Clearly had no idea
what I was in for.

1:06:34.338 --> 1:06:35.121
Now,

1:06:36.296 --> 1:06:37.863
you give her back to me.

1:06:38.037 --> 1:06:41.214
- Jo, let's be honest.

1:06:44.609 --> 1:06:46.045
She's ruining your life.

1:06:50.267 --> 1:06:51.833
- Give her back to me.

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:52.834
- No.

1:06:53.879 --> 1:06:55.011
No.

1:06:55.185 --> 1:06:56.882
- Give her back to me.
- No.

1:06:57.056 --> 1:06:58.666
And you have to be careful.
You don't wanna break her.

1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:00.407
- Give me my baby.

1:07:00.581 --> 1:07:01.887
- No!
- Give me-

1:07:02.061 --> 1:07:03.454
- Ow, shit!

1:07:03.628 --> 1:07:06.674
She fucking bit me!

1:07:17.207 --> 1:07:19.687
- Good job, Ruby. Good job.

1:07:19.861 --> 1:07:20.775
You did it.

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:23.039
We did it.

1:07:23.213 --> 1:07:24.866
I won't let them take you.

1:07:36.313 --> 1:07:37.966
- Are you okay?

1:07:38.141 --> 1:07:39.490
- I'm okay, for now.
- Yeah?

1:07:39.664 --> 1:07:41.318
Okay, thank God.
I was so worried.

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:43.102
- We don't have much time.
- Okay, that's okay.

1:07:43.276 --> 1:07:44.364
I was so worried,
I thought that you-

1:07:44.538 --> 1:07:46.018
- They want Ruby.

1:07:46.714 --> 1:07:48.064
- Who wants her.
- They want,

1:07:48.238 --> 1:07:49.717
they want her, I
don't know what for.

1:07:49.891 --> 1:07:51.545
- Okay, I don't understand.

1:07:51.719 --> 1:07:53.286
- I can't explain you,
but you have to trust me.

1:07:53.460 --> 1:07:56.246
- Okay, okay. Who wants Ruby?

1:08:05.646 --> 1:08:07.387
- You're still
wearing your apron?

1:08:07.561 --> 1:08:10.216
- Yeah, well, your message
said you were in danger,

1:08:10.390 --> 1:08:12.827
so I came as fast as I could.

1:08:13.350 --> 1:08:15.091
And she's okay,

1:08:15.265 --> 1:08:18.442
so no more sneaking around
where you don't belong.

1:08:20.096 --> 1:08:22.185
Stay here. I'm gonna go
upstairs and get cleaned up.

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:26.841
You're gonna stay right here,

1:08:28.974 --> 1:08:31.846
and then, when I come back
down, we can talk, okay, mm-hmm?

1:08:32.978 --> 1:08:33.674
You gonna be okay?

1:08:33.848 --> 1:08:34.762
- Yes, sure.

1:08:37.722 --> 1:08:38.549
- Good.

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:44.946
Stay here.

1:08:50.126 --> 1:08:51.214
- Oh!

1:08:51.388 --> 1:08:52.693
I'm sorry, Jo.

1:08:52.867 --> 1:08:54.565
I'm so sorry to barge in.

1:08:54.739 --> 1:08:57.394
I drove all the way home and
realized that I forgot my keys.

1:08:58.395 --> 1:08:59.787
Are you all right?

1:08:59.961 --> 1:09:02.442
- No, I'm, uh, I'm
fine.

1:09:02.616 --> 1:09:06.185
I'm fine. I was, uh, I was
just about to make dinner.

1:09:06.359 --> 1:09:08.405
- Oh, good, I'm starved.
Here, I'll watch her.

1:09:08.579 --> 1:09:10.276
Here. Come on, little on.

1:09:10.450 --> 1:09:11.364
Come to Googoo.

1:09:11.538 --> 1:09:13.236
Oh!

1:09:13.410 --> 1:09:15.890
Hi. She's
getting so big.

1:09:16.064 --> 1:09:18.110
She's getting such a big girl.

1:09:53.754 --> 1:09:56.061
Oh.

1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:00.631
- This is the best
bolognese I have ever had.

1:10:02.154 --> 1:10:05.897
- Yeah, well, you'll have
to give her the recipe.

1:10:07.246 --> 1:10:08.900
- Oh, it's pretty simple.

1:10:09.074 --> 1:10:11.294
All you have to do is
throw yourself into it.

1:10:21.652 --> 1:10:23.567
- Jo, we,
uh, we need to talk.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:26.222
- You don't like it?

1:10:27.788 --> 1:10:29.050
- You need a rest.

1:10:30.313 --> 1:10:31.923
A longer rest.

1:10:32.097 --> 1:10:34.186
- Maybe a few weeks away.

1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:35.927
Some professional help.

1:10:36.101 --> 1:10:38.103
There's medications
you can take and, uh,

1:10:39.844 --> 1:10:41.541
yeah, Ruby will be fine.

1:10:41.715 --> 1:10:42.847
Mom's offered to help.

1:10:45.763 --> 1:10:48.679
- It's true that
I, I've been really

1:10:50.507 --> 1:10:51.769
struggling and I,

1:10:53.553 --> 1:10:57.470
I didn't realize, nobody
helps mothers in this country.

1:10:59.951 --> 1:11:01.822
- We're gonna
get you the help you need.

1:11:01.996 --> 1:11:04.434
- Professionals
are coming.

1:11:04.608 --> 1:11:07.698
They're on their way now
to meet you and take you-

1:11:07.872 --> 1:11:08.829
- Without Ruby?

1:11:09.003 --> 1:11:10.178
- You said it yourself.

1:11:11.702 --> 1:11:12.659
Ruby's in danger.

1:11:14.531 --> 1:11:16.794
So they're gonna take you
to a place you can rest.

1:11:17.925 --> 1:11:19.100
We'll bring all your things.

1:11:31.983 --> 1:11:32.810
- Can I...

1:11:36.030 --> 1:11:37.684
Can I at least say
goodbye to her?

1:11:42.994 --> 1:11:44.604
- Of course.

1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:49.827
- Ruby, say goodbye to Mommy.

1:11:53.178 --> 1:11:55.136
Say bye to Mommy.

1:11:58.052 --> 1:11:59.576
I'm gonna miss you.

1:12:09.237 --> 1:12:10.804
I'm gonna miss you.

1:12:12.676 --> 1:12:15.418
Don't move!

1:12:15.592 --> 1:12:16.462
Just don't.

1:12:17.985 --> 1:12:20.858
You think you can get
rid of me so easily?

1:12:23.295 --> 1:12:25.732
You want me to believe
that I'm crazy,

1:12:27.255 --> 1:12:29.083
but I know what you're doing.

1:12:29.257 --> 1:12:30.563
I know the truth.

1:12:31.695 --> 1:12:32.478
I know.

1:12:34.872 --> 1:12:36.352
A mother's instincts never lie.

1:12:38.310 --> 1:12:41.574
How could you? How
could you do this to us?

1:12:42.706 --> 1:12:44.664
Your own daughter.

1:12:45.578 --> 1:12:47.145
I hate you.

1:12:48.059 --> 1:12:49.887
I don't know what this is.

1:12:50.061 --> 1:12:52.019
I don't know what
you want her for.

1:12:52.193 --> 1:12:55.458
But I promise this, you
will never have her.

1:12:56.981 --> 1:13:00.114
I will never, never
let her go. Never.

1:13:09.254 --> 1:13:10.081
Shit.

1:13:17.088 --> 1:13:20.613
- Jo, open the door!
Open the fucking door!

1:13:21.614 --> 1:13:23.486
Jo, open the door!

1:13:23.660 --> 1:13:24.791
Open the door!

1:13:25.836 --> 1:13:27.228
Jo! Come on, come on!

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:29.187
Don't fucking do this, Jo!

1:13:29.361 --> 1:13:30.841
Jo, open the door!

1:13:32.016 --> 1:13:33.626
Come on, come on!

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:35.454
Don't fucking do this, Jo!

1:13:35.628 --> 1:13:37.543
Stop the fucking car, Jo!

1:13:37.717 --> 1:13:40.416
Stop, stop the
fucking car! Stop!

1:13:41.504 --> 1:13:42.505
Jo!

1:13:42.679 --> 1:13:43.810
Come on!

1:13:43.984 --> 1:13:45.725
Stop the car. Come on!

1:13:45.899 --> 1:13:46.683
Jo!

1:13:50.774 --> 1:13:52.993
- Shh. It's okay, Ruby.

1:13:53.167 --> 1:13:54.995
It's, it's okay.

1:13:55.169 --> 1:13:56.475
It's okay, Ruby.

1:13:56.649 --> 1:13:57.433
Shh.

1:13:58.303 --> 1:13:59.826
Shh.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.611
It's okay, Ruby.

1:14:07.747 --> 1:14:08.531
Shh.

1:14:37.516 --> 1:14:38.952
We're okay.

1:14:39.126 --> 1:14:40.824
We're okay.

1:15:09.069 --> 1:15:10.462
Ruby?

1:15:30.830 --> 1:15:32.440
Where is Ruby?

1:15:48.456 --> 1:15:49.283
Ruby.

1:15:52.069 --> 1:15:53.113
Ruby?

1:15:53.287 --> 1:15:54.201
Where is Ruby?

1:15:54.375 --> 1:15:55.986
- She's okay.

1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:58.423
She's okay.

1:15:59.598 --> 1:16:01.992
You just get well now, okay?

1:16:02.775 --> 1:16:04.603
- I thought...

1:16:04.777 --> 1:16:07.432
- I know.
- I thought she was...

1:16:07.606 --> 1:16:08.781
I thought that you were,

1:16:10.478 --> 1:16:11.915
you were n- not...

1:16:13.264 --> 1:16:14.918
I don't know anymore.
- Shh.

1:16:15.092 --> 1:16:16.615
You just rest up, okay?

1:16:48.386 --> 1:16:51.824
- The
visions, psychotic episodes?

1:16:51.998 --> 1:16:52.782
- Gone.

1:17:03.314 --> 1:17:05.795
Auditory hallucinations?

1:17:05.969 --> 1:17:06.665
The crying in your head?

1:17:06.839 --> 1:17:08.232
- No.

1:17:13.237 --> 1:17:16.849
- Paranoia?
Conspiracy theories?

1:17:17.023 --> 1:17:18.155
- I think we're
gonna go to the park.

1:17:18.329 --> 1:17:19.591
We can all go to the park.

1:17:19.765 --> 1:17:21.898
- Monsters?

1:17:27.425 --> 1:17:28.252
- Only me.

1:17:30.733 --> 1:17:32.909
It all seemed so real.

1:17:34.084 --> 1:17:35.041
- It is real.

1:17:35.999 --> 1:17:37.217
Postpartum is real.

1:17:38.479 --> 1:17:40.177
And it's not your fault.

1:17:43.702 --> 1:17:45.051
- And if they come back?

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:47.837
The visions?

1:17:48.011 --> 1:17:50.143
- I
know you're afraid.

1:17:50.317 --> 1:17:52.668
Just take it moment by moment.

1:17:52.842 --> 1:17:55.453
You get through the first
night, and then the next,

1:17:57.063 --> 1:17:58.412
and then it gets easier.

1:18:03.940 --> 1:18:05.376
- Ready.

1:18:05.550 --> 1:18:07.465
- Okay.

1:18:10.424 --> 1:18:13.471
I'll get this.

1:18:16.517 --> 1:18:18.258
Wait till you see Ruby.

1:18:18.432 --> 1:18:21.261
She's scooting across the
floor on her little bum bum.

1:18:21.435 --> 1:18:25.831
And no words yet, but she's
just babbling away.

1:18:26.005 --> 1:18:28.268
And finally, she is
sleeping through the night,

1:18:28.442 --> 1:18:31.707
which was such a
relief, obviously.

1:18:35.101 --> 1:18:35.885
- Thanks.

1:18:36.886 --> 1:18:37.713
- For what?

1:18:39.236 --> 1:18:40.019
- Ruby.

1:18:42.152 --> 1:18:45.721
I, I don't know what we
would've done without you.

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:49.812
- It's nothing.

1:18:57.689 --> 1:18:59.169
- My mother died; I was,

1:19:00.561 --> 1:19:01.780
I was only a baby.

1:19:03.390 --> 1:19:04.435
- I know.

1:19:07.133 --> 1:19:08.831
- So I couldn't call you Mom.

1:19:11.877 --> 1:19:13.357
And I still can't.

1:19:15.707 --> 1:19:17.361
- It's okay.

1:19:18.405 --> 1:19:19.755
It's okay.

1:19:44.475 --> 1:19:45.389
- Go ahead.

1:19:46.477 --> 1:19:47.695
It's all right.

1:20:06.062 --> 1:20:08.194
- Uh, I have to go unpack.

1:20:52.586 --> 1:20:56.286
- Ruby should
go through the night.

1:20:57.809 --> 1:20:59.855
- I'll spend some time
with her in the morning.

1:21:03.162 --> 1:21:04.816
- She loves you.

1:21:07.688 --> 1:21:09.299
- How?

1:21:09.473 --> 1:21:10.996
After all I've done?

1:21:11.997 --> 1:21:12.955
- You're her mother.

1:21:16.045 --> 1:21:17.829
You know,

1:21:18.003 --> 1:21:21.877
when the police arrived at
the scene of the accident,

1:21:22.051 --> 1:21:23.400
you were barely conscious.

1:21:26.098 --> 1:21:27.317
Car was crushed.

1:21:29.928 --> 1:21:32.148
Nobody knows how, but somehow,

1:21:33.671 --> 1:21:35.499
you managed to crawl
out of your seat.

1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:40.025
You crawled back to Ruby.

1:21:41.940 --> 1:21:43.115
And when they found you,

1:21:45.901 --> 1:21:47.728
you were covering her,

1:21:49.121 --> 1:21:50.340
protecting her.

1:21:54.083 --> 1:21:55.127
- I'm scared.

1:21:57.608 --> 1:21:59.001
- Then...

1:22:08.575 --> 1:22:11.100
Let's just get through tonight.

1:22:23.939 --> 1:22:24.765
- Hey.

1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:34.950
I'm coming, Ruby.

1:23:06.764 --> 1:23:08.592
- Ruby.

1:23:32.050 --> 1:23:34.183
- Everything's gonna be okay.

1:23:34.357 --> 1:23:35.271
Shh.

1:23:38.883 --> 1:23:39.710
Shh.

1:23:41.016 --> 1:23:42.756
It's okay, Ruby.

1:23:42.930 --> 1:23:44.236
It's okay, Ruby.

1:23:45.194 --> 1:23:46.369
All right.

1:23:46.543 --> 1:23:47.326
Shh.

1:23:49.067 --> 1:23:50.286
All right. Shh.

1:23:51.504 --> 1:23:53.724
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:23:55.247 --> 1:23:57.467
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:03.995
That's what you wanted.

1:24:07.259 --> 1:24:10.958
Just give me one minute
to make your bottle.

1:24:11.133 --> 1:24:14.527
Yeah, it will just
be a minute, Ruby.

1:24:14.701 --> 1:24:17.487
Everything is gonna
be okay, Ruby.

1:24:32.632 --> 1:24:33.677
Please, Ruby.

1:24:35.374 --> 1:24:37.898
Please. You can do this.

1:24:49.606 --> 1:24:52.391
Yeah, Ruby can be patient.

1:24:53.610 --> 1:24:54.741
Yeah.

1:24:57.092 --> 1:24:58.615
Shut up, Ruby!

1:24:58.789 --> 1:25:01.792
You just stop your crying.

1:25:01.966 --> 1:25:04.534
You stop fucking crying!

1:25:04.708 --> 1:25:05.926
Make it stop.

1:25:15.980 --> 1:25:17.112
Hey!

1:25:17.677 --> 1:25:18.765
Hey!

1:25:18.939 --> 1:25:20.158
Ruby!

1:25:24.380 --> 1:25:25.511
Hey!

1:25:27.296 --> 1:25:28.427
Hey!

1:25:31.300 --> 1:25:32.301
Stop!

1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:48.578
Ruby!

1:25:53.844 --> 1:25:54.671
Ruby!

1:25:57.021 --> 1:25:58.153
No!

1:25:59.197 --> 1:26:00.198
No!

1:26:01.634 --> 1:26:02.722
No!

1:26:31.011 --> 1:26:34.493
You can't have her.

1:26:41.892 --> 1:26:44.547
You're a terrible mother.

1:26:46.418 --> 1:26:48.551
She doesn't want you

1:26:49.987 --> 1:26:51.162
as her mother.

1:26:54.470 --> 1:26:56.428
- I'm not afraid of you.

1:27:05.176 --> 1:27:06.395
I'm not afraid.

1:27:08.048 --> 1:27:08.875
I'm not.

1:27:10.050 --> 1:27:10.877
Come here.

1:27:12.618 --> 1:27:13.402
Come.
