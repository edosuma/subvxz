JARED (over radio):
Hold your line.

00:18.977 --> 00:19.976
Keep your speed up,

00:19.978 --> 00:21.010
Dana.

00:21.012 --> 00:22.445
You're doing great.

00:22.447 --> 00:24.213
I'm doing so great,
how come you're right up

00:24.215 --> 00:25.848
<i>on my ass?</i>

00:25.850 --> 00:27.350
I'm drafting you.

00:27.352 --> 00:30.920
(laughs)
Not for long, you're not.

00:30.922 --> 00:32.621

(laughs)

00:44.802 --> 00:46.302
DANA:
Jared?

00:47.405 --> 00:49.505
JARED:
Something's wrong.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.040
(engines revving)

00:52.043 --> 00:53.309
I can't brake!

00:54.445 --> 00:55.344
Jared?

00:55.346 --> 00:56.712
Oh, wait.

00:56.714 --> 00:57.747
I can't control it!

00:57.749 --> 00:59.015
(tires squeal)

00:59.017 --> 01:00.449
Jared!

01:04.122 --> 01:05.488

Got you back in the monkey suit
already, do they?

01:44.495 --> 01:46.162
- Oh.
- Monkey suit?

01:46.164 --> 01:49.465
I'm-I'm so sorry. I thought
you were Agent Gregorio.

01:49.467 --> 01:50.933
Oh. And you are...?

01:50.935 --> 01:52.668
Special Agent Dwayne Pride,

01:52.670 --> 01:54.236
NCIS.
Hey.

01:54.238 --> 01:55.571
He's the one I told you about.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.306
Oh, <i>the</i> Dwayne Pride.

01:57.308 --> 01:58.707
It's nice to meet you.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.176
I'm Hannah Lee. I'm with
the U.S. attorney's office.

02:00.178 --> 02:01.544
I.E., don't piss her off.

02:01.546 --> 02:04.180
We flew down here yesterday
together from D.C.

02:04.182 --> 02:05.314
Nice to meet you.

02:05.316 --> 02:07.550
Helping out with
the Javier Garcia investigation?

02:07.552 --> 02:09.085
Hoping to build a case
against him,

02:09.086 --> 02:11.253
so I can petition the grand
jury for an indictment.

02:11.255 --> 02:13.422
Cut the snake off at the head
and get the cartel

02:13.424 --> 02:14.990
out of NOLA once and for all.

02:14.992 --> 02:16.158
They don't call it
NOLA down here.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.393
They prefer New Orleans.

02:17.395 --> 02:19.295
Oh, glad to see we made
an impression on you, Gregorio.

02:19.297 --> 02:21.630
Oh, absolutely.
(Pride chuckles)

02:21.632 --> 02:23.132
You come bearing gifts?

02:23.134 --> 02:24.867
Uh, actually, Garcia does.

02:24.869 --> 02:27.369
Bourbon, as a thank you,

02:27.371 --> 02:29.638
for helping us save his
son's school last week.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.440
This is expensive stuff.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.675
I'd say that's more of a bribe.

02:32.677 --> 02:33.976
Yeah, why I brought it over.

02:33.978 --> 02:36.112
Thought you'd want to log it
as evidence.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.313
How's Sebastian?

02:37.315 --> 02:39.949
I bet he's so excited to be
a part of the team, huh?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.518
Not part of it yet, still has to
make it through FLETC training,

02:42.520 --> 02:45.454
which means, until he does,
we're short-handed again.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.639
I'm sorry to leave you
high and dry.

02:46.663 --> 02:47.290
Yeah.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.559
But look, if you need any help,
just let me know, all right?

02:49.560 --> 02:50.091
Okay.

02:50.094 --> 02:52.361
Except that I don't think
that you can.

02:53.264 --> 02:54.463
Director Isler made it
pretty clear to me

02:54.465 --> 02:56.098
that we are only
down here to build

02:56.100 --> 02:57.299
the case against Garcia,

02:57.301 --> 03:00.136
and then (beeping)
it's back to D.C. for good.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.572
Well... I get that.
It's an important case.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.708
I gotta go.
Nice to meet you, Ms. Lee.

03:06.677 --> 03:08.677
Hey, tell everyone I said hi,
okay?

03:08.679 --> 03:10.079
Yeah, you bet.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.782
Bye.

03:13.784 --> 03:15.417
Let's get back to work.

03:21.225 --> 03:23.926
(siren wailing)

03:23.928 --> 03:27.263
The victim is
Corporal Jared Connors, 28,

03:27.265 --> 03:28.664
Fourth Marine Division.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.699
Drove here regularly
when he was on leave,

03:30.701 --> 03:32.835
he even raced in the amateur
circuit a few times.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.570
Experienced driver.
Apparently.

03:34.572 --> 03:36.605
Him and the girlfriend,
Dana Wells,

03:36.607 --> 03:40.109
were the only drivers on
the track when he crashed.

03:40.111 --> 03:42.178
Lost control of his car?

03:42.180 --> 03:46.182
Yeah, except his father
thinks he was murdered.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.118
Russ Connors is a mechanic
on one of the racing teams.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.420
Told the sheriffs he's convinced
the car was sabotaged.

03:51.422 --> 03:54.089
Sabotage?
Why does he think that?

03:54.091 --> 03:55.724
Well, I didn't get
to talk to him.

03:55.726 --> 03:58.627
He got cut pretty bad taking his
son out of the wreck, so...

03:58.629 --> 04:01.997
Paramedics took and the
girlfriend to the hospital.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.504
Think that's case-related?

04:08.506 --> 04:11.073
More like trouble in paradise.

04:11.075 --> 04:14.476
I don't think he and Melody
are getting along right now.

04:14.478 --> 04:16.077
Well, it can't be easy...

04:16.079 --> 04:18.814
Woman pops into his life,
surprises him with a baby.

04:18.815 --> 04:20.716
At least Lasalle's trying to do
the right thing.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.785
Just wish it didn't affect
his work so much,

04:22.787 --> 04:24.486
undermanned as it is.

04:24.488 --> 04:26.155
Christopher!

04:33.898 --> 04:36.098
Cause of death appears to be

04:36.100 --> 04:38.968
blunt force trauma to the head,
neck, chest.

04:38.970 --> 04:41.770
It's consistent with an impact
of over 100 miles an hour.

04:41.772 --> 04:43.305
Oh, it's like he
never slowed down.

04:43.307 --> 04:45.407
And the only silver lining is

04:45.409 --> 04:46.842
the death is likely
instantaneous.

04:46.844 --> 04:48.143
He didn't suffer.

04:48.145 --> 04:50.012
PRIDE: Possible he had
a medical condition?

04:50.014 --> 04:52.281
Heart attack? Stroke?

04:52.283 --> 04:56.252
He's awfully young. But I'll
know more after the autopsy,

04:56.254 --> 04:58.420
and I'll do a tox screen
for drugs and alcohol.

04:58.422 --> 04:59.655
SEBASTIAN:
Hey, boss.

04:59.657 --> 05:00.789
Oh, wait, nobody calls you
"boss,"

05:00.791 --> 05:02.224
do they?
It's too informal.

05:02.226 --> 05:04.893
I get it, it's no way
to start a relationship.

05:04.895 --> 05:06.862
Sebastian, we're not
starting a relationship, okay?

05:06.864 --> 05:08.230
We've known each other
for years.

05:08.232 --> 05:10.199
Yeah, but not as employer
and employee.

05:10.201 --> 05:11.700
That's a whole different
dynamic, sir.

05:12.603 --> 05:13.602
"Sir" doesn't sound right,
either.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.204
You sure
about making this guy an agent?

05:16.140 --> 05:17.706
I find that hurtful,
you know, right here.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.208
The case, Sebastian.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.143
Right. Yeah, well, uh,

05:21.145 --> 05:23.646
it's really simple, I guess,
at least on the surface.

05:23.648 --> 05:26.248
Car was going too fast,
couldn't make the turn.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.349
Don't really need
fancy forensics

05:27.351 --> 05:28.317
to figure that part out.

05:28.319 --> 05:29.952
Any signs of sabotage?

05:29.954 --> 05:31.854
Not yet. But I'll have
the car transported

05:31.856 --> 05:33.989
to the evidence garage,
I'll do a full forensic work-up.

05:33.991 --> 05:36.358
Unless, of course, you need me
to stay here.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.260
Interview witnesses,
canvass the area.

05:38.262 --> 05:39.762
'Cause I am totally
up to speed on

05:39.764 --> 05:41.864
the NCIS investigation manual.

05:41.866 --> 05:44.266
And I need you to finish
the examination.

05:44.268 --> 05:47.169
You still work for me,
for now, remember?

05:47.171 --> 05:48.704
You got it, boss.

05:50.508 --> 05:53.042
PRIDE: We're not gonna leave
you undermanned, Loretta.

05:53.044 --> 05:55.344
Sebastian can still work
out of the lab for you,

05:55.346 --> 05:58.580
even after he becomes
a special forensics agent.

05:58.582 --> 06:02.017
Just wish somebody had
told me in advance.

06:03.387 --> 06:04.953
LASALLE:
Ooh, sorry about that, King.

06:04.955 --> 06:06.355
Won't happen again.

06:06.357 --> 06:07.990
Talk about it later.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.591
You got experience
tracking cars.

06:09.593 --> 06:10.793
What do you see?

06:10.795 --> 06:13.028
Well, not a lot
that makes sense,

06:13.030 --> 06:14.563
especially with
these skid marks.

06:14.565 --> 06:17.132
Racers know to control their
slides around turns,

06:17.134 --> 06:20.069
but these indicate that Jared
kept accelerating

06:20.071 --> 06:21.804
for some reason,
and then lost it.

06:21.806 --> 06:23.138
Well, maybe his accelerator
stuck.

06:23.140 --> 06:24.540
It's possible,

06:24.542 --> 06:28.210
but these skid marks are
inconsistent with braking,

06:28.212 --> 06:30.512
which begs the question,
why didn't he?

06:30.514 --> 06:33.682
Well, hopefully Sebastian will
be able to give us some answers.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.251
Meanwhile, let's find out
everything we can

06:36.253 --> 06:37.720
about our marine.

06:37.722 --> 06:40.155
Make sure he doesn't have
any skeletons in his closet.

06:40.157 --> 06:41.857
Count on you?
Absolutely.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.992
All right, Percy and I are gonna
head over to the hospital,

06:43.994 --> 06:46.195
talk to Jared's father.

06:46.197 --> 06:49.665
See if he can explain to us why
he thinks his son was murdered.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.934
RUSS: <i>I-I-I don't know why I</i>
<i>said it was sabotage.</i>

06:51.936 --> 06:53.402
<i>I wasn't thinking straight.</i>

06:53.404 --> 06:54.903
I was just upset, that's all.

06:54.905 --> 06:56.739
But, Mr. Connors,
there has to be a reason

06:56.741 --> 06:58.707
you thought initially
that it was sabo...

06:58.709 --> 07:02.211
I said I wasn't thinking.
Okay?

07:02.213 --> 07:03.912
My son just died.

07:03.914 --> 07:05.948
PRIDE:
Mr. Connors,

07:05.950 --> 07:09.351
I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you,

07:09.353 --> 07:13.222
but our job is to find out
what happened to your son.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.256
You know that, right?

07:14.258 --> 07:16.291
Sure. Of course.

07:16.293 --> 07:18.160
Do you know of any reason why

07:18.162 --> 07:20.796
somebody might have wanted
to hurt Jared?

07:20.798 --> 07:22.931
I-I don't know.

07:24.001 --> 07:26.135
What about you, Ms. Wells?

07:26.137 --> 07:27.970
Did you see anything suspicious?

07:27.972 --> 07:30.773
(sighs) No.
(clears throat)

07:30.775 --> 07:32.808
We were just chasing
each other around the track,

07:32.810 --> 07:34.243
you know, messing around.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.978
Jared was showing me
how to race.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.713
So it was your first time.

07:37.715 --> 07:40.449
I've been in racecars before.

07:40.451 --> 07:43.018
I'm the advance coordinator
for Warbury Racing.

07:43.020 --> 07:46.188
We're in town this week
for the race.

07:46.190 --> 07:48.023
You two work for
the same team?

07:48.025 --> 07:49.391
Yeah, about a year now, yeah.

07:49.393 --> 07:51.360
That's how I met Jared.

07:51.362 --> 07:52.861
We've been dating ever since.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.763
Was he a good driver?
He was great.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.331
RUSS: Well, he's been
racing his whole life.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.367
All the way back to go-carts.

07:58.369 --> 08:00.836
He was gonna turn pro
after his discharge.

08:00.838 --> 08:03.205
Possible it was
mechanical failure?

08:03.207 --> 08:06.408
No, no, no, we built
that car ourselves.

08:06.410 --> 08:08.777
Check it out head to toe
every time we took it out.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.013
Then I have to ask,

08:11.015 --> 08:14.650
was Jared upset
about anything? Depressed?

08:14.652 --> 08:17.486
No, he didn't crash on purpose,
if that's what you're implying.

08:17.488 --> 08:18.787
SONJA:
Okay, so...

08:18.789 --> 08:21.223
Sorry. If it wasn't intentional,

08:21.225 --> 08:23.926
and it wasn't driver
or mechanical error,

08:23.928 --> 08:25.294
what caused the crash?

08:25.296 --> 08:26.562
I don't know!

08:36.106 --> 08:37.972
Well, they're obviously
hiding something.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.008
The question is,
what and why?

08:40.010 --> 08:42.144
Either they're complicit,
which based on how they were

08:42.145 --> 08:44.546
both defending Jared,
it's hard to believe, or...

08:44.548 --> 08:46.482
They're too scared to talk
for some reason.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.984
Yeah. Which means we're gonna
have to figure out the truth,

08:48.986 --> 08:50.552
with or without their
help for now.

08:50.554 --> 08:52.154
Loretta's got autopsy
results.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.556
I'll see what she's found.

08:54.558 --> 08:56.058
Maybe you should catch
up with Christopher,

08:56.060 --> 08:58.760
go through Jared's house,
see if you can find any leads.

08:58.762 --> 09:00.329
I don't suppose we could
ask Gregorio

09:00.331 --> 09:02.231
to pitch in temporarily,
seeing as though

09:02.233 --> 09:03.265
we're spread pretty thin.

09:03.267 --> 09:04.800
No, I wouldn't count on it.

09:04.802 --> 09:07.603
Gregorio's helping
the U.S. attorney

09:07.605 --> 09:10.405
build an indictment
against Garcia.

09:10.407 --> 09:12.674
It won't be long before
she's heading home.

09:12.676 --> 09:14.877
Best let her be. Come on.
We've got things to learn.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.048
A prelim tox screen
was negative for any anomalies,

09:20.050 --> 09:23.051
so unless you come up with
something else,

09:23.053 --> 09:26.555
I'm ruling his death as
accidental.

09:28.726 --> 09:31.460
You brought me all the way
out here just to tell me that?

09:31.462 --> 09:34.429
No. Because I don't think
it was an accident,

09:34.431 --> 09:37.366
mainly because of this.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.269
Apparently, your marine
was stabbed,

09:40.271 --> 09:42.404
and based
on the granulation tissue

09:42.406 --> 09:43.672
and the degree of healing,

09:43.674 --> 09:45.807
I'd say this happened
three or four days ago.

09:45.809 --> 09:48.176
He stitch himself up?

09:48.178 --> 09:49.311
Appears so.

09:49.313 --> 09:51.880
Should've gone to the hospital.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.749
It's a pretty deep wound,
but he didn't go.

09:53.751 --> 09:55.417
That means he didn't want
the authorities

09:55.419 --> 09:56.818
to find out who stabbed him.

09:56.820 --> 09:58.587
And if this attack is
somehow connected

09:58.589 --> 10:00.455
to the crash that
killed him, then...

10:00.457 --> 10:01.990
Like I said,

10:01.992 --> 10:03.859
it's not an accident.

10:03.861 --> 10:06.962
Everybody's hiding something
about this case.

10:06.964 --> 10:08.797
Apparently, even Jared.

10:08.799 --> 10:11.433
(chuckles) That seems
to be going around.

10:12.937 --> 10:15.337
Loretta...
I'm sorry.

10:15.339 --> 10:17.739
But I wasn't hiding
anything from you.

10:17.741 --> 10:20.842
I assumed that Sebastian came
to you before he came to me.

10:20.844 --> 10:25.447
Truth is, I'd offered the
position to Gregorio first.

10:25.449 --> 10:26.648
And she turned you down?

10:26.650 --> 10:28.617
Wasn't the right fit for her,
I guess.

10:28.619 --> 10:29.685
So when Sebastian surprised me,

10:29.687 --> 10:30.986
said he wanted to become
an agent, I...

10:30.988 --> 10:33.822
Dwayne, I'm not mad
at you or Sebastian.

10:33.824 --> 10:36.992
I always knew he'd come out of
his shell sooner or later.

10:36.994 --> 10:38.160
The truth is,

10:38.162 --> 10:40.295
I think you need to
worry more about

10:40.297 --> 10:43.599
Sebastian driving you crazy in
the field, if I were you.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.168
(laughs)
Good possibility of that.

10:46.170 --> 10:48.403
Come on, go.
You got your hands full.

10:48.405 --> 10:50.205
You don't have to worry
about me, too.

10:50.207 --> 10:53.408
I always got time
for that, Loretta.

10:58.182 --> 11:00.148
(sighs)

11:00.150 --> 11:02.117
There must be over
$100,000 in here, huh?

11:02.119 --> 11:03.385
That's a lot of cash
for a corporal

11:03.387 --> 11:06.054
that barely clears
30 thou a year.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.956
You think it's dirty?
It's gotta be, right?

11:07.958 --> 11:09.825
I mean, why else
would Jared hide

11:09.827 --> 11:11.393
this much cash
in his garage?

11:11.395 --> 11:13.161
Plus, where'd he get it?

11:13.163 --> 11:14.830
Maybe he stole it
from a bank.

11:14.832 --> 11:17.432
This looks like
a dye pack went off.

11:17.434 --> 11:20.602
Hmm, apparently our marine isn't
as squeaky-clean as he seems.

11:20.604 --> 11:22.237
Well, only way
to find out is

11:22.239 --> 11:23.939
to figure out where
the cash came from.

11:23.941 --> 11:27.109
FBI specializes
in bank robberies.

11:27.111 --> 11:30.178
Maybe I'll send Gregorio
the serial numbers,

11:30.180 --> 11:32.514
see if she can trace 'em.
Gregorio?

11:32.516 --> 11:34.149
Aren't we supposed
to leave her alone?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.718
It's just a quick check.
It won't take her a minute.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.787
Yeah, uh-huh.
(imitating): Uh-huh.

11:38.789 --> 11:40.055
(chuckles)

11:40.057 --> 11:41.923
Lasalle, you know these people?

11:41.925 --> 11:43.892
Melody, what are you doing here?

11:43.894 --> 11:46.928
I'm sorry, Chris,
I told him not to come, but...

11:46.930 --> 11:48.563
Who are you?
(grunts)

11:48.565 --> 11:49.865
Hey!

11:49.867 --> 11:52.567
The baby's father!
That's who I am!

11:52.569 --> 11:54.770
Stay the hell away from my son!

11:54.772 --> 11:56.405
(struggling)

12:10.129 --> 12:13.097
Bend your arms now!
Son of a bitch!

12:13.099 --> 12:14.565
Melody, talk to me.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.435
Is he telling the truth?
Is Tucker not my son?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.470
You gotta believe me,
I never meant to hurt you.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.005
What is that
supposed to mean?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.440
Why did you lie to me?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.074
(struggling)

12:24.076 --> 12:25.109
I'm so sorry.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.610
Melody!

12:26.612 --> 12:29.947
Look, put him in interrogation
until NOPD comes.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.716
Let him go.
Do what?

12:32.718 --> 12:35.152
Look, I said just
let him go, damn it.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.521
I probably would have done
the same thing if I were him.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.890
Lasalle...
Look, just do it!

12:50.570 --> 12:52.603
Stay the hell away
from my kid.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.806
Get out of here before
I change my mind.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.147
PRIDE:
<i>You believe him?</i>

13:03.149 --> 13:05.749
I don't know
what to believe.

13:05.751 --> 13:08.052
Melody did seem pretty
clear about it, though.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.722
I mean, she kept saying
she was sorry.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.624
I mean, how could
she do it, King?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.526
Bring a little boy into my life

13:15.528 --> 13:18.829
and tell me I'm his father...
when I'm not?

13:18.831 --> 13:21.031
I don't know, Chris.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.733
Something you gotta ask her.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.970
Well, it won't change anything,
so what's the point?

13:25.972 --> 13:28.672
The point is,
you deserve to know.

13:28.674 --> 13:31.642
It doesn't matter, all right,
it is what it is.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.944
Christopher.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.313
It's not something
you can pretend didn't happen.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.482
It's bad enough
you let the guy go.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.484
It wasn't a big deal.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.020
Assaulting a federal officer
is always a big deal,

13:43.022 --> 13:44.488
and you know it.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.524
The fact that
you didn't arrest him

13:46.526 --> 13:47.925
tells me you're
not thinking straight.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.226
Look, don't worry
about me, King.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.461
All right?
I'm fine.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.896
Let's just get back to work.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.664
Sorry to interrupt,
but we just got a lead

13:53.666 --> 13:54.999
on the stolen money.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.367
Yeah, I'm on it.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.676
I don't see anything.
Where's the lead?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.512
Well, it's actually
not my lead, so...

14:08.514 --> 14:09.647
Took you long enough, Percy.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.115
I don't exactly have all day.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.783
Yeah, sorry,
something came up.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.618
You called Gregorio.
E-mailed.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.520
And it was just
some serial numbers,

14:16.522 --> 14:18.389
so this was all her choice.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.891
It's not a big deal, Pride.
Well, actually it is.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.493
The bills came
from a bank robbery

14:22.495 --> 14:24.361
in Biloxi, Mississippi,
six weeks ago.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.330
A teller slipped a dye pack
into the money

14:26.332 --> 14:27.865
before the robbers took off.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.968
Seems that makes our marine
a bank robber.

14:30.970 --> 14:34.271
Doesn't explain why
Jared was stabbed

14:34.273 --> 14:35.306
or who'd want to kill him.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.041
How many robbers in Biloxi?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.542
Witnesses said there were four,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.811
including a getaway driver,
heavily armed, too.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.213
SONJA: So, robbers
turning against each other?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.849
What's going on?
Oh, hey, Hannah.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.184
Agent Pride.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.852
LEE: This is about
the cartel case, I hope?

14:48.854 --> 14:50.854
Gotta go. Bye.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.856
Whoa.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.491
I hope we didn't
get her in trouble.

14:54.493 --> 14:57.795
Uh, not "we," you.
It was just an e-mail.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.663
Anyway, it got us
a lead, didn't it?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.865
Yeah, and possibly
Gregorio fired.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.668
I know how we all feel
about Gregorio,

15:04.670 --> 15:07.972
but we gotta learn to work
without her again, okay?

15:07.974 --> 15:09.640
Okay.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.142
Starting with
figuring out

15:12.144 --> 15:16.547
how, exactly, Jared's
connected to the bank robbery.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.283
Well, it may be what his father
and girlfriend were hiding.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.719
I mean, Dana seemed
really nervous.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.587
Let's have another
chat with them.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.689
Only separately
this time.

15:25.691 --> 15:29.093
Looks like Sebastian's found
something on the car.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.295
I'll check it out.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.636
Is he okay?

15:38.638 --> 15:39.970
Don't know.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.111
SEBASTIAN (grunts):
Little help, please?

15:47.913 --> 15:50.014
Ah, thank you.

15:50.016 --> 15:52.449
Man, I am sore.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.717
It's gotta be all that
ab work I've been doing

15:53.719 --> 15:55.719
prepping for NCIS
training, you know?

15:55.721 --> 15:57.888
Whoa. You care to
turn that off, please?

15:57.890 --> 16:00.057
What? Oh, right. Sorry.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.759
So what about
this beauty?

16:01.761 --> 16:03.327
Uh, I went over
what's left of the car

16:03.329 --> 16:04.762
with a fine-tooth comb.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.030
I didn't find
any evidence

16:06.032 --> 16:08.098
of a mechanical problem
or even sabotage.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.667
But?
But...

16:09.669 --> 16:11.168
when I ran a full
diagnostic

16:11.170 --> 16:13.270
on the car's controller
area network--

16:13.272 --> 16:14.805
that's, like, the brain.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.707
Pretty much controls everything
in the car these days.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.542
The CAN, I know.
It's a computer?

16:18.544 --> 16:19.977
Right, and just like
any computer,

16:19.979 --> 16:21.111
it can be upgraded
with new software

16:21.113 --> 16:22.579
but it can also be hacked--

16:22.581 --> 16:24.581
made to do whatever
the hacker wants it to do.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.483
Like accelerate
instead of brake?

16:26.485 --> 16:27.918
Yeah, in this case, exactly.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.287
Somebody overrode
the accelerator module

16:30.289 --> 16:31.555
wirelessly.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.323
Told it to keep
going faster.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.225
If done at the right time,
there's nothing a driver can do.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.927
And the right time
is just as

16:36.929 --> 16:38.395
Jared entered the turn,

16:38.397 --> 16:40.164
which means he was
definitely murdered.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.532
Yeah, it also means
that whoever did this

16:41.534 --> 16:43.300
knows exactly
what they're doing.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.471
No, what is she doing?

16:47.473 --> 16:48.439
Why, what's up?

16:48.441 --> 16:50.808
Never mind.
But I gotta go.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.576
Hey, fill in Pride on what
you found out, all right?

16:52.578 --> 16:55.813
Uh... okey-dokey.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.115
TRACK ANNOUNCER:
And that's Scott Hamilton...

16:58.117 --> 17:01.118
DANA: I wish I could
help you, I do,

17:01.120 --> 17:02.419
but I don't know how.

17:02.421 --> 17:03.887
PRIDE:
Yes, you do, Dana.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.656
There's no way you're
Jared's girlfriend

17:05.657 --> 17:07.090
and didn't know
something.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.159
Dana, your boyfriend
was murdered.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.426
Doesn't that matter
to you?

17:10.429 --> 17:11.762
Of course it does,
but I'm not gonna...

17:11.763 --> 17:13.964
Dana!
We just found out

17:13.965 --> 17:15.365
we lost our
qualifying slot.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.800
We don't qualify,
we don't race.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.402
Believe me, guys,
I'm working on it, okay?

17:18.404 --> 17:19.970
The racing committee
assumed we weren't racing

17:19.972 --> 17:21.438
because of what happened
to Jared.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.272
If we don't race,
we don't get points.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.974
Look, I know this is a
hard time for you, but...

17:24.977 --> 17:27.544
Don't worry, I'm on it!

17:27.546 --> 17:28.712
Harrison, Cal,

17:28.714 --> 17:30.681
these are federal agents.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.982
They're investigating
the crash.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.183
Investigating what?

17:33.185 --> 17:34.318
I thought it was an accident.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.487
Yeah, we're not so sure.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.989
Go, get ready.
I'll get us a slot.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.625
Sorry, I gotta get
back to work, guys.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.260
Whoa.
No, not until you tell us

17:43.262 --> 17:45.763
what you and Jared's father
are hiding.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.167
We know Jared was stabbed.
We know he had over $100,000

17:50.169 --> 17:53.570
of stolen money in his garage,
and we know there's no way

17:53.572 --> 17:54.638
that you didn't know
something about this.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.473
And this does not
look good

17:56.475 --> 17:58.175
for Jared right now, Dana.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.144
If you care about him,
you'll help us.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.112
I wish I could.

18:02.114 --> 18:04.047
If you're scared
for some reason,

18:04.049 --> 18:05.415
we can protect you.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.786
But if we find out
you're withholding anything,

18:08.788 --> 18:10.754
we have to arrest you.

18:13.359 --> 18:14.491
I have to go.

18:14.493 --> 18:17.094
Please.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.036
(cell phone beeps)

18:26.038 --> 18:27.771
That must be one
hell of a secret.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.673
Yeah.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.975
A text from Sebastian.

18:31.977 --> 18:36.647
It says that Christopher
wanted him to tell us

18:36.649 --> 18:39.449
that Jared was
definitely murdered.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.785
So where's Chris?

18:41.787 --> 18:44.721
Good question.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.358
Hey, Christopher.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.927
So you just send me
a text and then leave?

18:49.929 --> 18:50.961
I don't want to bother you

18:50.963 --> 18:52.029
any more than I already have.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.363
Bother me?
(chuckles)

18:53.365 --> 18:55.465
Is that what you call
what you did?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.837
Oh, Chris,
I'm so sorry.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.739
I-I shouldn't have done it.

19:02.741 --> 19:03.907
Look, I don't
understand.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.075
I took you in,

19:05.077 --> 19:06.210
I tried to do
the right thing,

19:06.212 --> 19:08.212
believed Tucker
was mine.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.580
Why did you lie about it?

19:09.582 --> 19:11.815
I guess I was just desperate.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.751
You know, to get away
from Darrell,

19:14.753 --> 19:16.954
to try and find a good
daddy for Tucker, I...

19:16.956 --> 19:19.923
Get away from Darrell?
What, did...

19:19.925 --> 19:21.658
did he try to hurt
you or something?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.393
(sighs)
Let's just... no.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.829
Melody, you gotta
talk to me.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.631
What's going on?

19:29.168 --> 19:32.135
Darrell has a temper,
and I was afraid.

19:32.137 --> 19:35.939
Not just... not just for me
but for Tucker.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.841
I tried to get a restraining
order against him,

19:37.843 --> 19:40.611
but they said I had to wait
until something bad happened.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.914
And I was afraid, and I just--
I didn't know what to do.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.550
I never meant
to hurt you.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.720
Okay.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.223
It's okay.
Yeah?

19:59.965 --> 20:01.765
Don't worry about Darrell.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.467
He's not gonna hurt
either one of you.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.238
First his accountant said that
he was laundering drug money

20:08.240 --> 20:10.607
through high-cash
businesses.

20:10.609 --> 20:11.942
Restaurants are big
down here, right?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.911
Huge.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.379
Kind of resisted them at first.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.381
As you know, I'm not
much of a foodie.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.349
What, now you are?

20:19.351 --> 20:21.251
As a matter of fact, I am.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.020
When in Rome, right?

20:23.022 --> 20:25.789
Well, maybe you can
help us narrow down

20:25.791 --> 20:28.025
which restaurants
are prime candidates.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.627
Okay.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.230
What do we got?
(computer blips)

20:33.232 --> 20:37.200
How about this...
Pat O'Brien's?

20:37.202 --> 20:38.902
Pat O's? No way
they're cartel.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.437
They've been in the
Quarter for decades.

20:40.439 --> 20:43.640
Make a killer hurricane
cocktail that'll...

20:43.642 --> 20:44.942
You should try one.

20:44.944 --> 20:48.178
I'm not here
for the cocktails, T.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.947
Okay.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.750
Let's just get Garcia
and get back home.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.285
(computer blips)

20:56.822 --> 20:59.056
I'm not sure I want
to go back home.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.292
Sorry?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.596
I'm just saying I'm not sure.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.898
Ten years ago,
you couldn't get

21:07.900 --> 21:09.566
far enough away
from this place fast enough,

21:09.568 --> 21:11.168
and now you like it?

21:11.170 --> 21:13.236
I don't understand, Tammy.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.605
This cartel case is
your big shot.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.441
Isler moves up,
you move up. It's...

21:17.443 --> 21:19.776
everything you've
always said you wanted.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.781
Isn't that why we broke up?

21:24.783 --> 21:27.951
This isn't about
me and you, Hannah.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.320
This is just about me.

21:30.322 --> 21:31.755
(scoffs)

21:31.757 --> 21:33.357
Still, when you say
you don't want to be

21:33.359 --> 21:35.926
in a relationship
because you want to focus

21:35.928 --> 21:37.594
on your career...
And that's the way

21:37.596 --> 21:39.496
I felt at the time.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.733
Look, I love

21:42.735 --> 21:45.235
what we had together,
you know that.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.406
But, you also know
I was running when I got to D.C.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.109
I didn't know who I was.

21:54.513 --> 21:57.581
Keep digging into Garcia, let me
know if you find anything.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.916
Hannah...

22:01.520 --> 22:03.253
(sighs)

22:03.255 --> 22:05.255
(computer beeps)

22:07.726 --> 22:09.593
Whoa.

22:09.595 --> 22:10.861
(beeps)

22:10.863 --> 22:12.496
Pride, call me back.
I think I just got

22:12.498 --> 22:14.831
a big break on your case.

22:27.784 --> 22:30.418
Had FBI's Robbery Task Force
see if there were

22:30.420 --> 22:32.553
any other robberies that matched
the MOs of the one

22:32.555 --> 22:35.856
in Mississippi:
bank in Orlando, one in Mobile,

22:35.858 --> 22:39.293
armored car in Atlanta.
All involved three masked gunmen

22:39.295 --> 22:41.395
with assault weapons
and a getaway driver.

22:41.397 --> 22:44.098
That pretty much matches most
bank robberies these days.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.733
Right. But what if
I told you each one

22:45.735 --> 22:48.402
also happened to take place
in the exact same city

22:48.404 --> 22:50.004
as a car race?

22:51.007 --> 22:52.373
PRIDE:
Huh.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.408
Suggesting that the heist crew

22:54.410 --> 22:56.877
is connected to
the racing circuit.

22:56.879 --> 22:59.313
Too much of a coincidence
for it not to be.

22:59.315 --> 23:01.415
I mean, whoever hacked
Jared's car

23:01.417 --> 23:03.684
obviously knew racecars
inside and out.

23:03.686 --> 23:06.387
Yeah, except Jared's a marine,
not part of the circuit,

23:06.389 --> 23:08.022
so why hack his car?

23:08.024 --> 23:10.491
That, I don't know.
Just curious,

23:10.493 --> 23:13.461
how'd you even know
Jared's car was hacked?

23:15.064 --> 23:17.264
Well, don't look at me.

23:17.266 --> 23:19.233
I left her alone like you said.

23:19.235 --> 23:21.802
I still have
my NCIS computer access.

23:21.804 --> 23:23.838
Figured I'd keep tabs
on you, you know,

23:23.840 --> 23:25.239
in case something popped up.

23:25.241 --> 23:27.108
'Cause she misses us.

23:27.110 --> 23:30.077
PATTON: Agent Gregorio!
Hey!

23:30.079 --> 23:32.313
Good to see you.
You, too. Let's pretend you didn't.

23:32.315 --> 23:33.948
I have to get back
to the Garcia case

23:33.950 --> 23:36.217
before I don't have
a case to get back to.

23:36.219 --> 23:38.119
Good luck!

23:38.121 --> 23:39.520
I thought she hated beignets.

23:39.522 --> 23:41.021
She does.

23:41.023 --> 23:43.357
So, we got four robberies,

23:43.359 --> 23:45.659
all connected
to the racing circuit,

23:45.661 --> 23:47.395
marked money in Jared's garage.

23:47.397 --> 23:49.897
Neither Russ
or Dana are talking.

23:49.899 --> 23:52.233
Hard not to think
that they're the bank robbers.

23:52.235 --> 23:54.969
Yeah, except Dana seemed
more scared than guilty.

23:54.971 --> 23:56.670
Check Jared's leave record.

23:56.672 --> 23:58.054
See where he was
on each of the robberies.

23:58.078 --> 23:59.574
Copy that.

23:59.575 --> 24:01.208
Hey, you might want to check,

24:01.210 --> 24:03.043
see if any of 'em
are cyber geeks.

24:03.045 --> 24:04.612
I dove into
the specifics

24:04.614 --> 24:06.347
of how they manipulated
that car crash.

24:06.349 --> 24:08.682
Whoever did it, they are good.

24:08.684 --> 24:10.651
I'm talking Mensa
hacker level good.

24:10.653 --> 24:12.753
Yeah, but...
it wasn't Jared.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.989
According to the marines,

24:14.991 --> 24:18.459
he was TDY on three
of the four robberies.

24:18.461 --> 24:21.128
So he couldn't have been
a part of the crew.

24:21.130 --> 24:22.763
Maybe he found out about it

24:22.765 --> 24:24.331
and tried to do the right thing

24:24.333 --> 24:26.267
and got killed before he could.

24:26.269 --> 24:28.569
Still doesn't explain
why he got stabbed

24:28.571 --> 24:30.371
or why Dana
was too scared to talk.

24:30.373 --> 24:33.107
Maybe we ought to take
another run at the father now?

24:33.109 --> 24:34.675
This time with a warrant.
(keys jingle)

24:34.677 --> 24:36.310
Let's bring him in.

24:36.312 --> 24:37.778
Deep-dive every team

24:37.780 --> 24:40.448
that competed in
those races, Patton.

24:40.450 --> 24:42.516
Especially Dana's.

24:42.518 --> 24:45.219
I'm hoping that a hacker
can find a fellow hacker.

24:45.221 --> 24:47.221
(chuckles) Come on, man.
That's what I'm all about.

24:47.223 --> 24:48.956
That's why I do what I do.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.524
Well, go do it.

24:50.526 --> 24:52.393
Come on, Christopher.

24:52.395 --> 24:54.361
Where the hell are you?
(line ringing)

24:54.363 --> 24:56.931
(phone ringing)

24:56.933 --> 24:58.699
(door closes in distance)

25:01.771 --> 25:03.037
(phone continues ringing)

25:03.039 --> 25:05.739
(sighs)
(beeps)

25:05.741 --> 25:07.908
(train passing)

25:12.882 --> 25:14.882
Hey.

25:14.884 --> 25:16.083
What the hell
are you doing here?

25:16.085 --> 25:17.885
I come here to give you
a friendly warning.

25:17.887 --> 25:19.987
Stay away from
Tucker and his mom.

25:19.989 --> 25:21.989
You understand?
(laughing): What?

25:21.991 --> 25:23.624
Get out of here, right...

25:23.626 --> 25:25.159
But I don't think you heard me.

25:26.195 --> 25:28.596
Look, I may not be Tucker's dad,

25:28.598 --> 25:30.764
but I'm not gonna let
anything happen to him

25:30.766 --> 25:32.533
or his mom.

25:32.535 --> 25:33.968
So, if I were you,

25:33.970 --> 25:36.670
I would just... stay away.

25:36.672 --> 25:39.240
- Or what?
- Well, trust me.

25:39.242 --> 25:41.175
You don't want to find out.

25:41.177 --> 25:44.545
You see, that's my boy
and my woman.

25:44.547 --> 25:46.914
So, why don't you stay
the hell away from them?

25:46.916 --> 25:48.682
(grunting)

25:48.684 --> 25:50.784
Ow! You're gonna
bust my arm. (yells)

25:50.786 --> 25:53.554
Look, I'm not warning
you again. You hear me?

25:53.556 --> 25:55.089
You stay away from them.
MAN: Hey!

25:55.091 --> 25:56.757
What's going on?

25:57.393 --> 25:59.026

Why do you keep

26:52.348 --> 26:54.481
responsible
for your son's murder?

26:54.483 --> 26:57.551
What kind of father does that?

Y-You don't understand.

27:00.623 --> 27:02.756
Try us.

27:02.758 --> 27:04.892
Is this about Dana?

27:04.894 --> 27:06.427
Is that it?

27:07.597 --> 27:10.364
Jared loved her
more than anything.

27:11.867 --> 27:13.567
And she loved him, too.

27:13.569 --> 27:14.759
He was gonna propose to her.

27:14.783 --> 27:16.095
What's that
got to do with anything?

27:16.096 --> 27:18.606
It's got everything
to do with it!

27:18.608 --> 27:20.975
Jared would do anything
for Dana,

27:20.977 --> 27:22.643
and she knew it, too.

27:22.645 --> 27:24.178
That's why she wanted

27:24.180 --> 27:26.714
to straighten out her life,
l-look for a way out.

27:26.716 --> 27:28.482
Dana was part of the heist crew.

27:28.484 --> 27:30.751
Yeah, but...
but she wanted to quit.

27:30.753 --> 27:32.019
For Jared.

27:32.021 --> 27:33.320
Except they wouldn't let her.

27:33.322 --> 27:35.255
Who's they?
The rest of the team?

27:35.257 --> 27:37.091
No, no, no.
Not everyone was involved.

27:37.093 --> 27:38.325
I wasn't either.

27:38.327 --> 27:39.354
I didn't know
about the robberies

27:39.355 --> 27:41.321
until Dana told me
at the hospital.

27:41.323 --> 27:41.860
I swear.

27:41.884 --> 27:44.054
So, what was Dana's
job on the crew?

27:44.293 --> 27:47.027
She was the getaway driver,
but like I said,

27:47.029 --> 27:49.596
she wanted out,
she threatened to come clean

27:49.598 --> 27:50.898
if they didn't let her go.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.499
So, what, they stabbed Jared

27:52.501 --> 27:54.201
to warn her?

27:54.203 --> 27:56.236
They found out that Dana

27:56.238 --> 27:59.406
was gonna tell him
the truth about the heists.

27:59.408 --> 28:01.642
She convinced Jared
not to go to the hospital,

28:01.644 --> 28:03.577
so he wouldn't get hurt worse.

28:03.579 --> 28:05.879
Dana couldn't tell Jared
the truth, either.

28:05.881 --> 28:08.949
She just asked him
to... to trust her.

28:11.287 --> 28:13.854
And the money in Jared's garage.

28:15.224 --> 28:17.124
It was her cut.

28:18.127 --> 28:20.594
She decided to tell...

28:20.596 --> 28:22.696
Jared the truth

28:22.698 --> 28:24.698
this weekend and...

28:24.700 --> 28:26.567
somehow they found out.

28:26.569 --> 28:28.235
Which is why they killed Jared.

28:28.237 --> 28:31.838
And they... and they threatened
to kill her and, um...

28:31.840 --> 28:33.607
and me, too, if...

28:33.609 --> 28:36.343
if she tried
anything else.

28:36.345 --> 28:38.545
That's why I was afraid
to tell you the truth.

28:43.319 --> 28:45.219
They're vicious.

28:48.824 --> 28:50.958
Well, if he's telling the (phone ringing)
truth, we need to find Dana

28:50.960 --> 28:52.759
and protect her.
That's where we're headed.

28:52.761 --> 28:54.027
(groans)

28:54.029 --> 28:55.729
Christopher, where the hell
have you been?

28:55.731 --> 28:57.631
I've been trying to get
a hold of you for hours.

28:57.633 --> 29:00.901
I know, King, I'm sorry, and
I'll explain it when I get in.

29:00.903 --> 29:03.570
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you?
Are you anywhere near the track?

29:03.572 --> 29:05.706
Avondale, maybe five,
ten minutes, why?

29:05.708 --> 29:07.841
Okay. I need you to head
over there as fast as possible,

29:07.843 --> 29:10.711
take Dana Wells into
protective custody. Arrest her

29:10.713 --> 29:12.246
if you have to,
just get her out of there,

29:12.248 --> 29:13.814
and don't do it in front
of any of her crew.

29:13.816 --> 29:15.249
I'll fill you in
when you get here.

29:15.251 --> 29:16.750
You got it.

29:16.752 --> 29:18.585
(engine roars, tires screeching)

29:25.394 --> 29:27.728
♪ ♪

29:27.730 --> 29:30.497
Ms. Wells?
Ms. Wells?

29:37.039 --> 29:38.572
(beeps)

29:38.574 --> 29:40.941
PRIDE:
Yeah, Chris.

29:40.943 --> 29:42.643
King, I think we're too late.

29:42.645 --> 29:45.545
- What do you mean?
- Looks like Dana's been taken.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.095
Track surveillance camera
has a pretty wide angle,

30:00.097 --> 30:03.499
but those are our guys forcing
Dana into that black Charger.

30:03.501 --> 30:05.267
Add the car to the BOLOs.

30:05.269 --> 30:07.002
LASALLE:
Nobody's seen Vernon, Dane,

30:07.004 --> 30:08.904
or St. Clair since this morning.

30:08.906 --> 30:11.173
Didn't even show up
to pre-check for today's race.

30:11.175 --> 30:12.775
They must know
that we're onto them.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.877
Yeah. And if so,
Dana could already be dead.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.278
PATTON:
Maybe not.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.347
I hit Dana's e-mails
and text messages

30:18.349 --> 30:21.684
with some Triple P-grade
hacking of my own.

30:21.686 --> 30:24.253
Turns out, she's not just
the advance coordinator

30:24.255 --> 30:27.723
for the races, she's the advance
planner for the robberies.

30:27.725 --> 30:29.091
Well, it makes sense.

30:29.093 --> 30:31.227
Advance coordinators go
to the next town

30:31.229 --> 30:32.862
a week ahead of each race.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.964
That's plenty of time
to prep for the next heist,

30:34.966 --> 30:36.832
and it's a perfect cover, too.

30:36.834 --> 30:38.734
PATTON: And that text indicates
that they're planning

30:38.736 --> 30:41.103
a hit today, in our town.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.171
You know where?

30:42.173 --> 30:43.205
She left the location

30:43.207 --> 30:44.507
out of the digiverse.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.141
You think they took Dana
to pull off

30:46.143 --> 30:47.743
one more heist?
LASALLE: If they did,

30:47.745 --> 30:49.245
then they did it by force.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.779
Means figuring out

30:50.781 --> 30:52.548
where the heist is gonna go down

30:52.550 --> 30:54.316
might be our only chance
to save her.

30:54.318 --> 30:57.453
Oh, we'll narrow down
possible targets in the area.

30:57.455 --> 30:58.721
No.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.523
Percy and Patton can do that.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.224
Have Sebastian see
if he can figure out

31:02.226 --> 31:05.661
what those schematics
and blueprints go to.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.898
Well, what does that leave me?

31:09.767 --> 31:11.934
Let's talk.

31:15.973 --> 31:18.340
I know, King, I messed up.

31:18.342 --> 31:20.476
You did more than
that, Christopher.

31:20.478 --> 31:23.445
Bad enough you went M.I.A.
in the middle of a case...

31:23.447 --> 31:25.748
and that can't ever
happen again, understand?

31:25.750 --> 31:26.916
It won't, but...

31:26.918 --> 31:28.150
NOPD called,

31:28.152 --> 31:30.085
said Darrell filed

31:30.087 --> 31:31.654
assault charges against you.

31:31.656 --> 31:32.721
What?

31:32.723 --> 31:34.189
He swung at me first.

31:34.191 --> 31:35.891
Yeah, well, lucky they found
a witness who said

31:35.893 --> 31:37.426
the same thing,
but that doesn't explain

31:37.428 --> 31:39.662
what you were doing there
in the first place.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.797
Look, Melody tried
to get a restraining order

31:41.799 --> 31:43.098
on him, all right?

31:43.100 --> 31:45.601
Said she was worried
for both her and Tucker.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.836
So, what, you thought

31:47.838 --> 31:49.772
you-you'd handle
it yourself,

31:49.774 --> 31:50.806
threaten him?

31:50.808 --> 31:51.840
Well, I did what

31:51.842 --> 31:52.875
needed to be done.

31:52.877 --> 31:54.443
I've seen you go off-book...

31:54.445 --> 31:55.744
Not about me.

31:55.746 --> 31:58.180
This isn't you,
Christopher.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.915
Maybe who you used to be,

31:59.917 --> 32:02.251
but this is not
who you've become.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.454
Emotional situation,
I get it,

32:05.456 --> 32:08.591
but you can't just go running
off hotheaded to solve problems,

32:08.593 --> 32:09.658
not anymore.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.794
I know.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.366
I know.

32:20.571 --> 32:23.472
You got to think about
what it is you want.

32:25.876 --> 32:27.977
You hoping to keep...

32:27.979 --> 32:29.311
Tucker in your life

32:29.313 --> 32:32.047
some way?

32:32.049 --> 32:33.349
I don't know.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.151
I know I want what's best
for him.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.388
But there's one thing I can do

32:39.390 --> 32:42.257
and that's protect them
from Darrell.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.227
Then figure out how to do that.

32:46.597 --> 32:49.365
There's a right way to handle
this, Christopher.

32:49.367 --> 32:51.166
Find it.

32:57.908 --> 33:01.310
What about this financial
manager, Simon Delaney?

33:01.312 --> 33:03.112
(phone ringing and buzzing)

33:06.250 --> 33:07.783
(cell phone beeps)

33:07.785 --> 33:09.585
Okay.
Anything?

33:09.587 --> 33:10.653
Yeah, here it is.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.887
Simon Delaney.

33:11.889 --> 33:14.356
Apparently,
he's also an officer

33:14.358 --> 33:16.959
of three other LLCs
connected to Garcia.

33:16.961 --> 33:20.529
Which means three more possible
drug-laundering companies.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.131
Is Garcia's name
on the title?

33:22.133 --> 33:25.200
I'll have to find out,
but if so...

33:25.202 --> 33:26.702
We might have enough
for an indictment.

33:26.704 --> 33:28.103
Mm-hmm.

33:28.105 --> 33:29.238
There's a
Special Agent Pride

33:29.240 --> 33:30.239
on the phone for you.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.007
Percy just called, too.

33:32.009 --> 33:33.342
Must be important.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.576
I'm sorry.

33:34.578 --> 33:36.378
I got to find out.
Tammy...

33:36.380 --> 33:38.580
PRIDE:
<i>Wouldn't have bothered you,</i>

33:38.582 --> 33:40.549
<i>but we think somebody's life</i>
<i>may be at stake.</i>

33:40.551 --> 33:42.251
Hoping FBI resources can help.

33:42.253 --> 33:43.686
Of course, what do you need?

33:43.688 --> 33:45.721
Well, you were right
about the racing circuit.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.056
We've IDed the heist crew

33:47.058 --> 33:49.091
and we think another
robbery may be imminent.

33:49.093 --> 33:50.793
Yeah, Patton got
blueprints and schematics,

33:50.795 --> 33:52.928
but the best we can figure out
is that it's a road map

33:52.930 --> 33:54.563
to certain IP addresses.

33:54.565 --> 33:56.065
Specifically,
the ones that relate

33:56.067 --> 33:57.866
to high-tech
communication systems

33:57.868 --> 33:59.368
made by Arsenal Protection.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.970
Apparently, they install them
in armored trucks

34:01.972 --> 34:05.340
to allow continuous monitoring
from security HQ.

34:05.342 --> 34:07.776
You know, the problem is,
we can't figure out

34:07.778 --> 34:08.811
which banks contracted

34:08.813 --> 34:11.346
with Arsenal for the system.

34:11.348 --> 34:13.949
Hoped Bank Robbery
Task Force database

34:13.951 --> 34:15.583
might have that
information.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.853
Let me see.

34:17.855 --> 34:20.422
Checked all local banks--
no issues

34:20.424 --> 34:22.056
and they're all closed
for the day now.

34:22.059 --> 34:23.559
Yeah, and all
the armored trucks

34:23.561 --> 34:24.860
are in and
accounted for.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.728
Look, we're...
running out of options.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.996
Did you check
Federal Reserve trucks?

34:28.998 --> 34:30.299
The Reserve?

34:30.301 --> 34:32.000
No way these guys
are crazy enough

34:32.002 --> 34:33.601
to go after the feds, are they?

34:48.485 --> 34:51.487
Drive.

35:06.510 --> 35:08.190
Patton still tracking
the armored truck?

35:08.290 --> 35:09.456
SONJA: They haven't hacked
into it yet.

35:09.458 --> 35:10.314
<i>The truck's still moving.</i>

35:10.315 --> 35:11.336
Half mile ahead.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.717
When is backup arriving?

35:12.718 --> 35:15.218
Crew could be monitoring
police communications.

35:15.220 --> 35:17.721
Too risky to call,
especially for Dana.

35:17.723 --> 35:20.390
<i>Cut over to Magnolia,</i>
<i>we'll box them in.</i>

35:20.392 --> 35:22.258
(tires squeal)

35:26.965 --> 35:28.732
(tires screech)

35:28.734 --> 35:30.767
Heads up!
I think we're being followed.

35:30.769 --> 35:32.535
Call it in.

35:35.307 --> 35:36.773
What're you doing?
Wasn't me.

35:36.775 --> 35:38.108
The truck
just shut down.

35:38.844 --> 35:39.876
(tires screech)

35:39.878 --> 35:42.278
Move and you're dead.

35:44.416 --> 35:46.016
Locks!
Now!

35:47.619 --> 35:49.352
Come on!
Take it, take it easy.

35:49.354 --> 35:51.187
- Move it!
- Okay, okay, all right, all right.

35:51.189 --> 35:52.756
Get the money!

35:52.758 --> 35:54.624
(tires screech)

35:59.464 --> 36:00.463
(shouts)

36:00.465 --> 36:01.965
Go, go, go!

36:01.967 --> 36:03.700
NCIS!

36:04.770 --> 36:06.736
I got this.
Go get Dana.

36:06.738 --> 36:08.471
(siren wailing)

36:15.313 --> 36:17.747
(tires squeal)

36:26.391 --> 36:28.324
Wait, i-is she signaling us?

36:28.326 --> 36:29.659
She wants us
to cut around.

36:29.661 --> 36:30.627
Why?

36:30.629 --> 36:31.928
One way to find out.

36:31.930 --> 36:33.530
Hang on.

36:33.532 --> 36:35.198
(tires screeching)

36:39.304 --> 36:41.171
CAL:
What are they doing?

36:42.374 --> 36:43.707
(tires screeching)

36:43.709 --> 36:45.341
(Cal shouts)

36:46.011 --> 36:47.343
(Cal grunts)

36:49.648 --> 36:51.114
(Cal grunts)

36:51.683 --> 36:52.849
Federal agents!

36:52.851 --> 36:54.851
Hands up!
Get out the car!

37:00.859 --> 37:02.025
LASALLE:
You okay, Dana?

37:02.027 --> 37:04.928
Yeah, I think so.

37:04.930 --> 37:06.062
Nice driving.

37:06.064 --> 37:08.431
You, too.

37:12.270 --> 37:14.204
(grunts)

37:20.712 --> 37:23.780
Can't guarantee Dana
won't spend some time

37:23.782 --> 37:25.882
behind bars, Mr. Connors.

37:25.884 --> 37:30.353
I mean, after all, she was
complicit until she wasn't.

37:30.355 --> 37:31.921
Yeah, I know.

37:31.923 --> 37:34.190
But I spoke to the
federal prosecutors,

37:34.192 --> 37:39.462
told them everything she did
to help us bring down the crew.

37:39.464 --> 37:41.865
Plus, she's cooperating,

37:41.867 --> 37:44.334
so I'm hopeful.

37:45.203 --> 37:46.636
At least one way or the other,

37:46.638 --> 37:48.605
she's out from underneath it...

37:48.607 --> 37:50.373
finally...

37:50.375 --> 37:51.908
and safe.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.844
That's all I wanted.

37:57.816 --> 37:59.949
That's all Jared
would've wanted.

38:12.097 --> 38:13.396
Take care.

38:13.398 --> 38:15.598
Yeah.

38:17.736 --> 38:19.269
(clears throat)

38:19.271 --> 38:20.370
Poor dude.

38:20.372 --> 38:22.639
He's been through a lot.

38:22.641 --> 38:26.176
Gonna go through
a lot more, too.

38:26.178 --> 38:29.512
Losing a child, nothing harder.

38:29.514 --> 38:31.781
Sort of know
how he feels.

38:33.351 --> 38:35.385
Still...

38:35.387 --> 38:36.986
we did a lot of good...

38:36.988 --> 38:39.689
especially considering
we're down a man.

38:39.691 --> 38:40.924
I'm proud of you.

38:40.926 --> 38:42.358
Yeah, but I didn't feel

38:42.360 --> 38:43.626
like we were down a man, though,

38:43.628 --> 38:44.828
the way everybody
was pitching in.

38:44.830 --> 38:46.062
It was kind of cool.

38:46.064 --> 38:47.764
Didn't get Gregorio fired,
either.

38:47.766 --> 38:49.299
As far as we know.

38:49.301 --> 38:50.633
(Lasalle laughs)

38:50.635 --> 38:52.702
Well, we'll finally
get back up to speed

38:52.704 --> 38:54.604
once Sebastian gets
through training.

38:54.606 --> 38:57.674
In the meantime...

38:57.676 --> 38:59.676
let's take the day off.

38:59.678 --> 39:01.277
Now, that works for me.

39:01.279 --> 39:04.180
(chuckles)

39:04.182 --> 39:05.748
Man, I can just

39:05.750 --> 39:08.852
hear that firing range
calling my name.

39:08.854 --> 39:10.053
(chuckling): Geez.

39:10.055 --> 39:12.388
What about you?

39:12.390 --> 39:14.524
I think you know.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.995
Hey.

39:18.997 --> 39:20.830
Think we have enough
for an indictment?

39:20.832 --> 39:23.299
I'll let you know when
I get back, but I doubt it.

39:23.301 --> 39:25.201
We are still looking
for the smoking gun

39:25.203 --> 39:28.404
to directly link Garcia
to NOLA businesses.

39:28.406 --> 39:30.073
New Orleans.

39:32.210 --> 39:34.844
New Orleans.

39:34.846 --> 39:36.246
You really have changed

39:36.248 --> 39:37.614
since you've been down here,
haven't you?

39:37.616 --> 39:38.848
How so?

39:38.850 --> 39:41.017
You seem happier...

39:41.019 --> 39:42.352
which is a good thing.

39:43.622 --> 39:46.256
Not for us, maybe,
but for you, definitely.

39:48.026 --> 39:51.027
Maybe...

39:51.029 --> 39:53.363
you finally have
stopped running.

39:53.365 --> 39:54.964
I think so.

39:55.767 --> 39:57.066
Still, what are you

39:57.068 --> 39:59.435
gonna do for work?

39:59.437 --> 40:01.070
NCIS slot's already filled.

40:01.072 --> 40:02.272
I don't know.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.474
I was thinking I'd
try talking Isler

40:04.476 --> 40:06.876
into transferring me here.

40:06.878 --> 40:07.844
(both chuckle)

40:07.846 --> 40:09.545
Good luck.
Isler needs you.

40:09.547 --> 40:11.881
He's not gonna let
you go that easily.

40:11.883 --> 40:14.651
Yeah, well, if he doesn't,
I'm screwed.

40:14.653 --> 40:16.786
(sighs)

40:16.788 --> 40:18.154
Well...

40:23.194 --> 40:26.262
...good luck.

40:28.767 --> 40:31.401
(sighs)

40:42.681 --> 40:45.448
What-what are the police
doing here?

40:45.450 --> 40:47.717
Oh, it's no big deal--
they're just here in case

40:47.719 --> 40:49.585
Darrell shows up
before you leave.

40:49.587 --> 40:51.888
But how does he know
that we're leaving?

40:51.890 --> 40:53.256
Oh, a little birdie
might've told him.

40:53.258 --> 40:54.290
What?

40:54.292 --> 40:56.893
Look, Melody...

40:56.895 --> 40:59.595
you don't have to worry
about him anymore, I promise.

40:59.597 --> 41:01.431
Why, what are you gonna do?

41:01.433 --> 41:02.498
What needs to be done.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.666
(engine roaring)

41:05.403 --> 41:06.970
All right, you stay here.

41:06.972 --> 41:08.771
You put Tucker in the car.

41:08.773 --> 41:10.640
I'll be right back, all right?

41:14.813 --> 41:16.813
What's going on, huh?

41:16.815 --> 41:18.181
They're arresting
you, Darrell.

41:18.183 --> 41:19.115
Hey, what're you doing?

41:19.117 --> 41:20.316
Get off me.

41:20.318 --> 41:21.517
LASALLE:
I did a background search.

41:21.519 --> 41:22.885
You got outstanding
warrants in Texas.

41:22.887 --> 41:25.922
That, plus assaulting
a federal officer,

41:25.924 --> 41:27.557
you'll be going away
for a long time.

41:27.559 --> 41:29.826
(grunting)
Settle down, hands behind your back!

41:29.828 --> 41:30.994
This ain't right, okay?

41:30.996 --> 41:31.928
You can't do this to me.

41:31.930 --> 41:33.029
Already did.

41:33.031 --> 41:34.797
I told you to stay
away from them

41:34.799 --> 41:35.965
and I meant it.

41:35.967 --> 41:37.800
Now, go on, get him out of here.

41:44.809 --> 41:45.975
I don't know
what to say.

41:45.977 --> 41:47.910
There's nothing to say.

41:47.912 --> 41:50.279
You came to me
for help, right?

41:50.281 --> 41:52.849
It may not have
turned out the way

41:52.851 --> 41:54.450
either of us
wanted it to, but...

41:54.452 --> 41:56.219
it's how it turned out

41:56.221 --> 41:58.154
and it's all right.

42:01.150 --> 42:03.717
I do...

42:03.719 --> 42:05.286
and besides...

42:05.288 --> 42:07.554
I got to imagine myself
being a daddy.

42:07.556 --> 42:08.589
(chuckles)

42:08.591 --> 42:11.091
I like how it feels.

42:11.093 --> 42:13.627
Thank you.

42:13.629 --> 42:15.796
Thank you.

42:22.138 --> 42:24.004
(kisses)

42:24.673 --> 42:26.006
Bye-bye.
