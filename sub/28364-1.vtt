01:28.820 --> 01:29.686
Hello?

01:29.688 --> 01:31.522
- Happy birthday, mom.
- Lena!

01:31.524 --> 01:34.157
Are you-are you
on your way home?

01:34.159 --> 01:36.627
Well I was thinking
about staying a couple of days

01:36.629 --> 01:38.895
and-and then coming back down.

01:38.897 --> 01:39.862
Sound good?

01:41.766 --> 01:45.835
keep it down, it's my baby girl.

01:45.837 --> 01:48.404
Mom? Mom who is
that? Where are you?

01:48.406 --> 01:50.473
Ray, there's plenty of ice,

01:50.475 --> 01:54.480
you just have to look
in the bowl, you dip-shit!

01:54.813 --> 01:56.713
Ray s back.

01:56.715 --> 01:59.650
You know Ray, he
never really leaves.

01:59.652 --> 02:00.918
Mom, what's wrong?

02:00.920 --> 02:03.586
Nothing, nothing.

02:03.588 --> 02:06.290
Mom, come on now, what is it?

02:06.292 --> 02:09.294
Please don't be mad at me.

02:10.294 --> 02:13.297
Why, what happened? Are you ok?

02:13.299 --> 02:15.301
I m broke!

02:15.935 --> 02:18.869
I had to sublet the place.

02:18.871 --> 02:23.707
- What!?
- Don t yell at me. I had to.

02:23.709 --> 02:26.609
What the fuck am I
supposed to do, mom!?

02:26.611 --> 02:28.711
It was too much
money to pass up.

02:28.713 --> 02:32.718
It was two grand a month!

02:33.953 --> 02:37.157
I had no choice.

02:41.627 --> 02:43.994
We ll talk later, okay?

02:43.996 --> 02:48.498
- I m so sorry, Lena.
- Happy Birthday.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.503
Treat yourself well today, ok?

03:10.355 --> 03:11.922
Hey.

03:11.924 --> 03:14.791
I'll get a uh-a pack of reds.

03:14.793 --> 03:16.827
A couple of rumple nips

03:16.829 --> 03:18.831
You got I.D.?

03:20.765 --> 03:23.532
Don't usually drink this hard.

03:23.534 --> 03:26.303
Not really a big smoker either.

03:26.305 --> 03:28.905
Those aren't good for you.

03:28.907 --> 03:31.841
I m really not in the mood.

03:31.843 --> 03:34.846
That good? Thanks.

03:37.316 --> 03:38.850
Hi.

03:49.694 --> 03:54.364
Hey, I am really sorry
I was so nosy in there.

03:54.366 --> 03:55.565
I'm Rebecca Witherspoon,

03:55.567 --> 03:57.967
but people who
know me call me Becca.

03:57.969 --> 04:00.406
Alright, it's
just been a rough day.

04:01.606 --> 04:03.072
I'm Lena.

04:03.074 --> 04:07.877
Things will get better,
just trust in the higher power.

04:07.879 --> 04:10.479
She won't judge you.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.582
You know she's a she too, huh?

04:12.584 --> 04:15.854
Absolutely.
No man could be so strong.

04:17.889 --> 04:19.389
Where are you from?

04:19.391 --> 04:21.925
Ahh, Utica, upstate New York,

04:21.927 --> 04:23.726
but I've been living in
Manhattan for a little bit.

04:23.728 --> 04:26.329
Such a big place, New York City.

04:26.331 --> 04:28.735
I don't care much
for all those people.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.767
Are you heading back?

04:31.769 --> 04:33.502
Plans fell through.
I actually was hoping

04:33.504 --> 04:35.605
this would help
me figure it out.

04:35.607 --> 04:39.575
Oh. Oh, and here's my

04:39.577 --> 04:40.976
injury prone daughter Sadie.

04:40.978 --> 04:43.880
- I hurt my knee, mom.
- Oh. What happened?

04:43.882 --> 04:47.683
I twisted it good. I'm Sadie.

04:47.685 --> 04:50.687
I m Lena. How'd you do it?

04:50.689 --> 04:52.122
Chasin a squirrel.

04:52.124 --> 04:53.957
Yeah? Did you catch him?

04:53.959 --> 04:55.726
Funny.

04:55.728 --> 04:58.598
Okay, let's see. Does this hurt?

04:59.598 --> 05:04.935
- Not really. A little.
- How about this?

05:04.937 --> 05:07.939
What about this?

05:12.144 --> 05:14.980
I think you're
alright. Nothing too serious.

05:45.037 --> 05:47.974
Thanks, doc. I'll
be jiggin' for squid.

05:49.943 --> 05:51.575
Nice meetin' ya.

05:51.577 --> 05:54.145
Hey, go easy!

05:54.147 --> 05:56.648
My child.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.482
Hey, it was really
nice to meet you, Becca.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.588
Nice to meet you
too, Lena. Take care.

06:04.123 --> 06:07.893
Hey, you know Lena, my
husband is, well he runs a

06:07.895 --> 06:10.929
landscaping business
out of our farm... and,

06:10.931 --> 06:15.736
I know that he needs people.
And, room and board is included.

06:15.936 --> 06:17.371
So,

06:18.972 --> 06:20.638
his name

06:20.640 --> 06:23.710
is Kellen Witherspoon.

06:27.181 --> 06:29.614
And everyone on
the island knows him.

06:29.616 --> 06:32.452
Thank you.
That's really nice of you.

06:32.952 --> 06:36.487
Take care,
we'd love to have you...

06:36.489 --> 06:38.825
Bye... Hey Sadie?!

06:51.070 --> 06:54.174
Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.909
It s time to
get off of this rock.

06:57.911 --> 07:00.811
Damn,
I ve been saying that for 20 years.

07:00.813 --> 07:03.681
But here's to a fine season

07:03.683 --> 07:07.518
working with both of you
lovely ladies. Hoist 'em up!

07:07.520 --> 07:12.890
Hold 'em high! This is a
special toast to the wild,

07:12.892 --> 07:16.094
wonderful, unbreakable hearts

07:16.096 --> 07:18.063
that the three of us posses

07:20.700 --> 07:22.202
Oh boy.

07:23.003 --> 07:26.007
This is exactly
what we need right now.

07:26.272 --> 07:27.938
Oh, hello, there.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.008
Alright, Walter.
You got a heat on.

07:30.010 --> 07:32.109
I m fine, we've
been out for days

07:32.111 --> 07:35.013

07:35.015 --> 07:37.549

07:40.120 --> 07:42.653
You guys wanna
join us? It's on me.

07:42.655 --> 07:44.922
Ah, no. We've had
enough, but thanks.

07:44.924 --> 07:47.928
You guys.

07:49.296 --> 07:51.498
Better luck next time.

07:52.132 --> 07:54.566

07:54.568 --> 07:55.799
- C'mon!
- Have some respect.

07:55.801 --> 07:58.869
- You did say just one.
- ...Door was open.

07:58.871 --> 07:59.905
Alright, no. That's it then.

07:59.907 --> 08:01.306
- The door was open!
- You guys are out of line.

08:01.308 --> 08:03.174
You guys look pretty banged up.

08:03.176 --> 08:05.010
- You look pretty banged u...
- All right, that's it!

08:05.012 --> 08:06.210
You believe this crap?

08:06.212 --> 08:08.145
- Come on!
- You guys gotta get out of here.

08:08.147 --> 08:10.015
- This is our fuckin' island!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:10.017 --> 08:11.749
I'm sorry. Come on.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

08:11.751 --> 08:13.118
Billy s a fuckin' wash-a-shore.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.020
- It was nice meeting you.
- Keep walking, C'mon.

08:15.022 --> 08:16.587
I wish we could have
met under better circ...

08:16.589 --> 08:18.689
- Fucking summer's over.
- You fucking degenerate.

08:18.691 --> 08:20.694
Get out of here.

08:22.296 --> 08:24.996
Oh, I m gonna miss you guys.

09:00.933 --> 09:02.066
Where you headed?

09:02.068 --> 09:02.935
Oh, boy.

09:02.937 --> 09:07.305
What? I'm fine, it's safe,

09:07.307 --> 09:10.941
I'm not drunk. Where you goin'?

09:10.943 --> 09:12.277
Up-island.

09:12.279 --> 09:14.849
Me, too. Come on in.

09:16.216 --> 09:18.749
Are you gonna be nice?

09:18.751 --> 09:22.253
I swear, it's broad day
light. What am I gonna do?

09:25.092 --> 09:27.093
Alright.

09:37.803 --> 09:39.937
I m Devon.

09:39.939 --> 09:41.943
Lena.

09:45.779 --> 09:48.783
You guys were pretty
loaded the other night.

09:49.249 --> 09:52.683
I m sorry if I was rude, I-

09:52.685 --> 09:56.654
the whole thing is a
little bit foggy, to be honest.

09:56.656 --> 09:58.191
I ll bet.

09:59.425 --> 10:03.029
Headin up-island,
huh? Where you going?

10:04.164 --> 10:05.866
Well,

10:08.135 --> 10:10.869
Kellen Witherspoon's farm.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.207
Becca s my cousin.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.205
No shit.

10:15.207 --> 10:17.841
Of course she is.

10:17.843 --> 10:19.811
You're an islander, huh?

10:19.813 --> 10:22.814
Born and raised,
five generations.

10:22.816 --> 10:25.720
Which means I
actually got here late.

10:27.821 --> 10:31.225
What are you doing up at
the farm, are you staying there?

10:34.394 --> 10:36.097
Maybe.

10:39.098 --> 10:41.298
It s so beautiful up here.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.303
It's a lot different.

10:44.303 --> 10:46.237
Everybody seems to
know everybody's business

10:46.239 --> 10:48.175
whether you like it or not.

10:51.778 --> 10:54.115
What s your business?

10:54.847 --> 10:56.683
Ah-ha.

10:59.086 --> 11:02.454
Hey, you wanna go
fishing, some time?

11:02.456 --> 11:06.423
Fishing? It's kinda late in
the season for that, isn't it?

11:06.425 --> 11:09.159
They're still around. I caught
a forty pounder last week.

11:09.161 --> 11:11.863
I would take you all the way up

11:11.865 --> 11:13.868
but I'm runnin' late.

11:18.071 --> 11:19.774
For you.

11:23.009 --> 11:25.712
It's down the road a
piece, you can't miss it.

12:56.369 --> 12:58.372
Lena?

13:00.140 --> 13:02.143
Hey Sadie.

13:03.175 --> 13:05.944
Well, looks like
your knee is better.

13:05.946 --> 13:07.177
Yup.

13:07.179 --> 13:08.245
Nice job.

13:08.247 --> 13:11.148
One shot! You
wanna help me skin it?

13:11.150 --> 13:13.518
Ah, maybe.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.886
Maybe I'll just watch.

13:14.888 --> 13:16.891
Come on.

13:39.379 --> 13:41.879
Do you hunt a lot?

13:41.881 --> 13:44.581
Just little guys around the
farm. Stuff that's a nuisance,

13:44.583 --> 13:49.888
mostly. Sorry little guy, but
you just eat too many veggies.

13:49.890 --> 13:53.191
- Oh, whattya got there?
- Daddy! I got him with one shot!

13:53.193 --> 13:56.194
- I swea...
- Woah! Oh, look at that! Nice!

13:56.196 --> 13:57.527
Hi, I'm Kellen

13:57.529 --> 13:59.162
Lena, Lena Detroy.

13:59.164 --> 14:01.365
Oh, you're the doctor.

14:01.367 --> 14:04.335
Yeah Becca mentioned
she ran into you in town.

14:04.337 --> 14:05.603
Ar-are you looking for work?

14:05.605 --> 14:08.273
I told him you fixed my leg.

14:08.275 --> 14:11.008
- Ah, yeah, yeah, I'm here fo...
- Wow, no, no, don't skin him

14:11.010 --> 14:12.509
just yet honey. I wanna go
through it with you again.

14:12.511 --> 14:16.013
Just put the
knife down, sweetheart.

14:16.015 --> 14:17.248
That's a nice job.

14:17.250 --> 14:20.051
You clean him up real good,
okay? Put the hard brush to it.

14:20.053 --> 14:21.922
I know, I know.

14:24.223 --> 14:25.455
This all you got?

14:25.457 --> 14:27.224
Ah, yeah, I travel light.

14:27.226 --> 14:30.930
You never know when you might
have pick up and go, you know?

14:31.231 --> 14:33.500
I wish I did know.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.273
See you later.

14:56.188 --> 14:59.058
I have a surprise for you.

14:59.391 --> 15:03.161
Hey! Lena!
Welcome to the farm.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.564
Thank you so much.
Kellen's been showing me around.

15:06.566 --> 15:09.367
Yeah. He's quite the host.

15:09.369 --> 15:11.636
I'm amazed by this property.

15:11.638 --> 15:15.509
Mmm-yeah.
I never take it for granted.

15:18.712 --> 15:21.414
you didn't tell her
about Susan's tree?

15:22.082 --> 15:25.217
I was a-saving
that one for you.

15:29.289 --> 15:31.723
Susan was our first daughter.

15:31.725 --> 15:35.696
Ah-she was lost to the pond.

15:36.362 --> 15:40.498
She loved her chrysanthemums
or "mummy's" as she'd say.

15:40.500 --> 15:44.438
"More mummy's for
me mommy, please?!"

15:44.770 --> 15:46.537
Uh-I'm sorry.

15:46.539 --> 15:49.574
Oh, don't be.

15:49.576 --> 15:52.947
Those mums keep
it lively around here.

15:55.481 --> 15:59.484
Well, I'm gonna-I'm
gonna take Lena up to the house.

15:59.486 --> 16:04.321
Alright. Well I'm delighted
you've decided to join us, Lena.

16:04.323 --> 16:06.356
And if you need
anything, please let me know.

16:06.358 --> 16:10.363
This one doesn't pay that
much attention to the details.

16:12.164 --> 16:15.099
Thank you so much, Becca, really
from the bottom of my heart.

16:15.101 --> 16:17.801
Oh, stop it, run
along. Enjoy your day off.

16:17.803 --> 16:19.470
He's gonna put you to work and

16:19.472 --> 16:21.471
you may not be
thanking me so much.

16:21.473 --> 16:24.242
- Uh oh.
- Ah.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.444
- Let's go.
- Alright.

16:26.446 --> 16:28.449
See ya. Bye.

16:40.059 --> 16:43.460
You see, over there,
that old oyster shack. Uhh...

16:43.462 --> 16:47.532
Bartholomew has been staying
in there wi-with Sienna lately.

16:47.534 --> 16:48.532
How'd you get up here?

16:48.534 --> 16:52.836
- Devon gave me a ride.
- Devon? Becca's cousin?

16:52.838 --> 16:56.673
- Yeah
- Sheesh, guy's a character.

16:56.675 --> 16:59.679
So, ahh.
Bartholomew works for you?

17:00.212 --> 17:04.580
He's been with me
fifteen years. Ahh-

17:04.583 --> 17:07.819
But he's mostly on his own.
Mowing fields, cutting down

17:07.820 --> 17:10.421
trees, he's real handy.

17:10.423 --> 17:13.790
Ah, also
qu-quite the fisherman.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.791
What about Sienna?

17:15.794 --> 17:19.128
Sienna, she ahh-

17:19.131 --> 17:23.768
scalloper, just got her
commercial license. Fall River.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.472
Oh.

17:26.371 --> 17:29.543
You know. So,
alright, come on. Let's umm-

17:34.447 --> 17:37.514
So, this is where
you'll be staying.

17:37.516 --> 17:40.885
Umm-your room is through
the living room on the right.

17:40.887 --> 17:42.653
- I don't know what to say.
- Okay

17:42.655 --> 17:46.523
Now, I can pay you uh, twenty
an hour off the books. Umm-

17:46.525 --> 17:49.726
Now mo-most of these kids are
leaving soon but there's plenty

17:49.728 --> 17:52.129
of work over the winter umm-

17:52.131 --> 17:54.298
and I can always
use a good farm hand.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.567
This is really
generous of you, Kellen.

17:56.569 --> 18:00.838
You'll work for it, trust me.
Uhh-now go on. Go on inside.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.274
and uhh-you let me know if you
need anything. Mor-more blankets

18:04.276 --> 18:07.544
or anything. Winter is
definitely coming early

18:07.546 --> 18:09.549
this year.

18:10.650 --> 18:14.188
Now, it's nice to
have a fresh face around.

18:14.687 --> 18:19.392
Uhh-Marge is your roommate,
and uhh-They'll be back soon.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.361
Okay.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.821
Hey, I'm Marge.

19:24.823 --> 19:27.925
Hey umm-I'm Lena,
you're new roommate.

19:27.927 --> 19:29.560
Really?

19:29.562 --> 19:31.329
I'm surprised
Kellen would hire somebody

19:31.331 --> 19:33.397
new this late in the season.

19:33.399 --> 19:34.831
We're all leaving
in a couple of weeks.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.701
I don't know, he
made it seem like there was

19:36.703 --> 19:37.936
plenty of work, so-

19:37.938 --> 19:41.539
Yeah. I guess there's always
plenty of work to do on a farm.

19:41.541 --> 19:44.544
ahh, I'm actually in
the middle of laundry.

19:45.277 --> 19:47.278
Do you wanna come with?

19:47.280 --> 19:48.782
Yeah.

20:08.368 --> 20:09.870
Honestly,

20:10.370 --> 20:13.873
I'm a little surprised anyone
would wanna come work up here.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.540
Why do you say that?

20:16.542 --> 20:19.545
That girl who went
missing a few of months ago?

20:19.879 --> 20:22.280
Emily Backus?

20:22.282 --> 20:24.648
It was all over the news.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.716
Shit, yeah. I think
I did hear about her.

20:26.718 --> 20:29.453
Yeah, that was here.

20:29.455 --> 20:33.624
That bed you were napping on
earlier? That was Emily's bed.

20:33.626 --> 20:35.629
Fuck.

20:36.496 --> 20:39.832
There were searches, her
parents came in from Indiana.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.733
I don't know, she was
kind of wild so I guess

20:42.735 --> 20:47.437
it wasn't that surprising. The
whole thing was just bizarre.

20:47.439 --> 20:49.610
She just never turned up.

20:51.444 --> 20:54.844
One of the other crew members,
Jimbo, you'll meet him later.

20:54.846 --> 20:57.750
They were dating
when she disappeared-

21:01.521 --> 21:06.323
honestly, I don't love
the vibe of this whole farm.

21:06.325 --> 21:08.926
Kellen and his
family are so weird.

21:08.928 --> 21:12.463
Have you met the couple
that lives by the pond?

21:12.465 --> 21:15.334
So ready to get out of here.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.103
Sorry,

21:20.105 --> 21:22.742
maybe you'll love it here.

21:32.051 --> 21:34.053
Let's get out of here.

21:44.563 --> 21:46.897
- Hey, Marge.
- James

21:46.899 --> 21:50.501
Guys, this is Lena, our
new teammate and roommate.

21:50.503 --> 21:52.837
She's taking Emily's bed.

21:52.839 --> 21:56.376
Welcome, hi Lena.

21:56.909 --> 21:58.542
Hey.

21:58.544 --> 22:01.078
Welcome to our
humble party abode.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.115
- Hi, I'm Cassie.
- Nice to meet you.

22:04.117 --> 22:06.920
Zoe, nice to meet you.

22:08.086 --> 22:11.789
You guys think I-you took
the words right out of my mouth.

22:16.161 --> 22:18.364
Cheers!

23:23.496 --> 23:24.695
Hey there, whatchya doin'?

23:24.697 --> 23:25.728
Fuck!

23:25.730 --> 23:27.831
- Sorry.
- Come on now.

23:27.833 --> 23:29.934
No, no, wait, not in the
face. We don't do that here.

23:29.936 --> 23:31.534
Just move it over.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.169
All right.

23:33.171 --> 23:35.638
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

23:35.640 --> 23:39.146
I live over there,
with Bartholomew. I'm Sienna.

23:40.646 --> 23:42.149
Lena.

23:43.850 --> 23:47.016
New blood, huh? What are you
like, partying with them folks?

23:47.018 --> 23:48.752
- I'm staying up there.
- Mmm.

23:48.754 --> 23:50.888
I met Becca in town and
she offered me some work and a

23:50.890 --> 23:52.892
place to stay, so.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.092
That's handy.

23:56.094 --> 23:57.962
Yeah, she s sweet.

23:57.964 --> 24:00.898
Becca? Sweet?

24:00.900 --> 24:03.167
Well, I don't know, she
don't like me too much.

24:03.169 --> 24:04.901
- Oh yeah? Why is that?
- Yeah

24:04.903 --> 24:07.804
Well, I drive too
fast, that's for one thing

24:07.806 --> 24:12.642
and she does not approve of me
and Bartholomew, you know.

24:12.644 --> 24:15.245
They're pretty protective
of my Bart around here.

24:15.247 --> 24:16.946
Doesn't sound so bad.

24:16.948 --> 24:19.716
Well I'm not an
Islander, I'm from Fall River?

24:19.718 --> 24:21.217
Up by the trailer.

24:21.219 --> 24:22.820
And I don't think
they really like the idea

24:22.822 --> 24:25.222
of me like splittin'
the farm with him one day.

24:25.224 --> 24:28.259
Why do you wanna leave?

24:28.261 --> 24:31.094
It's ahh, It's
kinda stuffy around here.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.129
- Really.
- Yeah.

24:33.131 --> 24:36.300
Hey, you know umm-Becca's
cousin though? What's his name?

24:36.302 --> 24:37.201
- Devon.
- Devon

24:37.203 --> 24:39.136
Yeah, yeah. I know
him from the docks.

24:39.138 --> 24:40.638
Oh you got a thing?

24:40.640 --> 24:43.674
- Oh yeah, ok. No that's cool.
- Get outta here.

24:43.676 --> 24:46.644
No that's good,
I mean, have fun but just,

24:46.646 --> 24:49.146
I'd say don't get too involved
with the locals, you know?

24:49.148 --> 24:50.281
- Oh Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:50.283 --> 24:53.984
Didn't you just tell me
Bartholomew is an islander?

24:53.986 --> 24:56.086
Yeah, but that's like,

24:56.088 --> 24:59.122
That's mad love, baby.

24:59.124 --> 25:03.159
- Mad love. Okay.
- Mhmm.

25:03.161 --> 25:04.864
Okay.

25:06.765 --> 25:09.065
I'm gonna go back in.
But it was nice to meet you,

25:09.067 --> 25:10.134
you know, you seem cool.

25:10.136 --> 25:11.936
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

25:11.938 --> 25:13.270
I said like, two words.

25:13.272 --> 25:16.639
Yeah, but I can tell,
you know, instincts.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.644
I'll see you.

27:56.134 --> 27:59.138
Ahhhhhhh!!!

28:29.168 --> 28:31.968
No more seed for you, suckers.

28:39.044 --> 28:40.144
Morning, everybody.

28:40.146 --> 28:42.545
Morning, Kellen.

28:42.547 --> 28:45.381
I'm sure you've
all met Lena by now.

28:45.383 --> 28:47.917
Morning, welcome aboard.

28:47.919 --> 28:49.421
Thanks.

28:50.255 --> 28:53.823
Ah, Listen, you've all
been uh, doing a nice job and

28:53.825 --> 28:57.528
I know you're packin' up soon,
so I've got some good news.

28:57.530 --> 28:59.862
Uhh, We're gonna
do that pig roast Thursday.

28:59.864 --> 29:01.398
- Ooooo oooooo
- Do not touch me.

29:01.400 --> 29:05.301
Come on. Half day of work
then uhh-we'll meet up at the

29:05.303 --> 29:08.839
pit by the pond
early afternoon. Sound good?

29:08.841 --> 29:10.874
- Right on, Kellen.
- Yeah.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.811
Hey, how bout an
easy day today, Kellen.

29:13.813 --> 29:17.246
Come on, you still
wanna earn some money? Right?

29:17.248 --> 29:21.083
We're gonna clear brush, dig
holes and we have to get that-

29:21.085 --> 29:23.520
Hey! Come on.

29:23.522 --> 29:26.590
We need to get it ready for
the irrigation piping, okay?

29:26.592 --> 29:29.993
So, head on up there, everything
you need is in the shed,

29:29.995 --> 29:34.263
and ah, have fun.

29:48.313 --> 29:51.484
So how long you been
working for the Witherspoons?

29:52.083 --> 29:55.985
These harmless
hicks? Long enough.

29:55.987 --> 29:57.987
Loved it that much, huh?

29:57.989 --> 30:00.224
It has been
a magical experience.

30:00.226 --> 30:02.292
Well, it couldn't
have been all bad.

30:02.294 --> 30:04.997
I heard you had
a fling for yourself.

30:05.296 --> 30:06.929
Marge told me you
were dating that girl.

30:06.931 --> 30:10.266
The one that went missing.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.971
Marge has a big mouth.

30:14.372 --> 30:17.242
We weren't dating,
we were just hanging out.

30:17.642 --> 30:20.279
C'mon, let's go take
care of the hay low.

30:26.619 --> 30:29.319
So what's you're deal, anyways?

30:29.321 --> 30:32.622
Lone woman wanders
onto the farm in search of

30:32.624 --> 30:35.157
romance and intrigue?

30:35.159 --> 30:37.494
Ah, yeah, no.

30:37.496 --> 30:40.199
I'm just, you know.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.065
Soaking it all in.

30:43.067 --> 30:50.374
In case you're lookin',
strong, charming-handsome.

30:50.376 --> 30:53.109
You know the seasons almost over

30:53.111 --> 30:55.344
and trying to find a
woman in the wintertime

30:55.346 --> 30:58.514
is like trying to find a
parking spot in the summertime

30:58.516 --> 31:00.684
either they're all taken

31:00.686 --> 31:02.889
or they're all handicapped.

31:06.457 --> 31:08.190
That's fucked up.

31:08.192 --> 31:11.227
It's true. So true.

31:11.229 --> 31:12.963
Hey, Sadie.

31:12.965 --> 31:14.965
Whatchya doin' up there?

31:14.967 --> 31:16.399
What did ya get?

31:16.401 --> 31:19.069
Nothing this time. I'm just
going to feed the chickens.

31:19.071 --> 31:20.270
Wanna come?

31:20.272 --> 31:23.106
No, I've-I gotta work
for your dad, sweetie.

31:23.108 --> 31:25.111
Maybe next time.

31:26.544 --> 31:29.111
You actually talk to her?

31:29.113 --> 31:32.215
I've been here for six months
and I don't even know her name.

31:32.217 --> 31:34.219
Her name's Sadie.

31:35.955 --> 31:37.457
Sadie.

31:52.338 --> 31:53.570
Hey, Lena.

31:53.572 --> 31:54.638
Sienna.

31:54.640 --> 31:59.042
Come over for beers
later. I got scallops, too.

31:59.044 --> 32:01.046
I'll see ya.

32:07.652 --> 32:09.686
What do you know about her?

32:09.688 --> 32:12.356
They pretty much
keep to themselves.

32:12.358 --> 32:15.361
That's the
friendliest I've ever seen her.

32:16.061 --> 32:18.094
You wanna go?

32:18.096 --> 32:22.131
No, I'm beat and that
invite was definitely for you.

32:22.133 --> 32:24.636
- Wimp.
- Trust me.

32:44.622 --> 32:46.625
Sadie!

32:52.264 --> 32:54.967
What are you doing?

32:56.567 --> 32:59.636
Why do they gotta load
the darn thing so much!

32:59.638 --> 33:01.341
Here.

33:04.309 --> 33:07.109
Was that yoga
stuff you were doin?

33:07.111 --> 33:09.513
Yeah, yoga stuff.

33:09.515 --> 33:12.215
Maybe you could show
me some moves someday?

33:12.217 --> 33:13.483
Absolutely.

33:13.485 --> 33:17.255
You might wanna put those boots
on. It's pretty mucky in there.

33:30.101 --> 33:32.604
Here piggy
wiggies. Come and get it!

33:37.708 --> 33:39.711
Get it, get it good.

33:44.483 --> 33:48.118
Wanna see something really cool
that I've never shown anybody?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.621
Sure.

33:50.522 --> 33:52.525
Follow me.

34:23.155 --> 34:25.254
C'mon, it's okay, I promise.

34:25.255 --> 34:26.290
Are you sure?

34:26.292 --> 34:30.063
Of course I'm sure.
My daddy is the caretaker.

34:30.829 --> 34:31.726
Okay.

34:31.728 --> 34:33.431
Come on.

34:40.271 --> 34:44.274
Oh, Sadie?
I can't see a thing.

34:44.275 --> 34:47.146
Just keep walking
straight, come on.

34:58.856 --> 35:00.524
This must be Susan.

35:00.526 --> 35:02.459
She would've
been my older sister.

35:02.461 --> 35:04.894
This is very beautiful.

35:04.896 --> 35:07.930
It must have
taken you a long time.

35:07.932 --> 35:10.635
Yeah, well it is for my sister.

35:13.771 --> 35:15.472
Are you allowed
to be down here?

35:15.474 --> 35:19.376
Allowed? My daddy's the
caretaker. This is my place.

35:19.378 --> 35:24.381
It's my secret place. And I've
never shown anyone before.

35:24.383 --> 35:27.816
Well it's an honor, Sadie. Thank
you. You're sure it's okay?

35:27.818 --> 35:31.690
Mmm hmm. I turn off the
alarms every single year.

35:33.191 --> 35:34.591
Who lives in this house?

35:34.593 --> 35:38.260
Some rich folks, they come
here for two weeks in July

35:38.262 --> 35:40.265
The Richardson's.

35:40.898 --> 35:43.300
They have a little girl my age.

35:43.302 --> 35:46.805
You should see what kind
of stuff they toss down here.

35:47.905 --> 35:50.842
Hey, let me help you.

35:53.512 --> 35:55.381
Let's see-

35:57.615 --> 35:59.619
Let me see.

36:03.354 --> 36:05.722
Do you like my secret place?

36:05.724 --> 36:07.624
So far.

36:07.626 --> 36:08.794
Good.

36:10.595 --> 36:13.930
Would you like me
to put make-up on you?

36:13.932 --> 36:17.834
No. I think I'll
go au natural today.

36:17.836 --> 36:20.840
But it looks very
elegant on you, my dear.

36:23.508 --> 36:26.309
Is there a wizard
behind that curtain?

36:26.311 --> 36:28.010
No, I wish there was a wizard.

36:28.012 --> 36:30.715
But it's just a
bunch of their crap.

36:34.253 --> 36:36.385
It's cold in here.

36:36.387 --> 36:38.390
I have something for you.

36:58.876 --> 37:01.611
Is that Sienna's hat?

37:01.613 --> 37:03.316
No.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.653
Here.

37:09.621 --> 37:11.887
No, it's okay, I have this.

37:11.889 --> 37:16.292
No, take it. It's a gift.

37:16.294 --> 37:18.296
Thank you.

37:33.445 --> 37:35.912
See, I can be a lady, too.

37:35.914 --> 37:39.849
Aren't I magnificent?
Don't I look beautiful?

37:39.851 --> 37:44.754
Well, of course you
do darling but remember,

37:44.756 --> 37:46.955
beauty is only skin deep.

37:46.957 --> 37:49.459
What does that mean?

37:49.461 --> 37:53.930
It means that
beauty is about you.

37:53.932 --> 37:56.566
It s about what's inside.

37:56.568 --> 37:58.901
So if it's all
ugly on the inside

37:58.903 --> 38:01.870
you're gonna be
ugly on the outside too.

38:01.872 --> 38:04.640
I don't want to be ugly.

38:04.642 --> 38:07.979
You aren't. And you're
not gonna be, sweetie.

38:10.816 --> 38:14.517
Do you have any sisters?

38:14.519 --> 38:16.486
Only me.

38:16.488 --> 38:18.722
Perfect.

38:18.724 --> 38:20.490
Why is that perfect?

38:20.492 --> 38:23.492
Because I could've had
one and you don't have any.

38:23.494 --> 38:27.365
So maybe you can be my
older sister? If you wanted to.

38:31.135 --> 38:32.468
I'm in.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.403
Under one condition.

38:34.405 --> 38:35.439
What's that, Sadie?

38:35.441 --> 38:38.742
You promise to never
ever come here without me.

38:38.744 --> 38:40.446
Promise?

38:41.979 --> 38:44.684
I promise. You can trust me.

39:04.468 --> 39:07.340
You showed! Come on in, darlin!

39:12.043 --> 39:14.814
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

39:33.965 --> 39:35.631
To new friends!

39:35.633 --> 39:37.436
Hell, yeah!

39:41.773 --> 39:43.807
Hey, did you want
Marge to come tonight?

39:43.809 --> 39:45.575
Mmm, Not really.

39:45.577 --> 39:47.042
- What, you don't lik...
- No, I just like get the

39:47.044 --> 39:49.044
impression she thinks
she's better than me. You know?

39:49.046 --> 39:51.648
She didn't look
me in the eye when we met.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.050
I got nothin'
against her. I just-

39:54.052 --> 39:57.053
you look like a scrapper.

39:58.789 --> 40:00.490
- You do. Ye...
- A scrapper, really?

40:00.492 --> 40:01.624
Uh huh.

40:01.626 --> 40:04.626
Wow, well maybe. I mean I
guess that's what happens

40:04.628 --> 40:06.195
when your crazy mama raises you.

40:06.197 --> 40:07.997
Crazy?

40:07.999 --> 40:12.602
Yeah, well I mean, drunk
is more like it, actually.

40:12.604 --> 40:16.475
Yeah she uh, hit the bottle
pretty hard when my dad died.

40:20.110 --> 40:23.046
But hey, ah,
where's this Bartholomew?

40:23.048 --> 40:26.051
When am I going to meet
this mystery man of yours.

40:26.785 --> 40:28.785
Fishing.

40:28.787 --> 40:30.086
- Fishing?
- Mm hmm.

40:30.088 --> 40:31.620
- Out there?
- Yeah

40:31.622 --> 40:33.256
- Does he freeze...
- Well he bundles up.

40:33.258 --> 40:35.461
His machine runs hot.

40:36.561 --> 40:38.995
You know,

40:38.997 --> 40:41.263
I saw that tree
today in the field.

40:41.265 --> 40:45.501
Mmm-that's weird. I know, they
bury their own around here.

40:45.503 --> 40:47.172
It happens.

40:50.876 --> 40:52.642
Oh, it's Bartholomew.

41:11.662 --> 41:13.562
Hey baby, catch anything?

41:13.564 --> 41:16.568
You know I never catch nothin.

41:18.903 --> 41:20.570
What ve you girls
been getting into?

41:20.572 --> 41:24.006
Oh nothing.
Couple beers, girl talk.

41:24.008 --> 41:27.012
- Don't let me stop the party.
- Oh, we won't.

41:28.914 --> 41:31.213
Hey, I'm Lena.

41:31.215 --> 41:32.984
Bartholomew.

41:34.885 --> 41:36.686
Get outta here.

41:36.688 --> 41:39.722
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

41:39.724 --> 41:42.227
- I better go.
- Yeah?

41:43.028 --> 41:45.628
Thanks for tonight. It was fun.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.863
Anytime, doll. You
know where to find me.

41:47.865 --> 41:49.568
See ya.

42:01.880 --> 42:05.814
I got that bastard,
I got that son of a bitch. Ahh!

42:05.816 --> 42:07.082
Way to go, Daddy!

42:07.084 --> 42:10.088
Easy on the language, sweetie.

42:11.122 --> 42:13.021
It was that peanut
butter, wasn't it?

42:13.023 --> 42:14.856
You were sure
right about that, babe.

42:14.858 --> 42:16.191
Eat the bacon, daddy.

42:16.193 --> 42:18.294
All right, eggs for you both.

42:18.296 --> 42:20.162
Here you go-

42:20.164 --> 42:22.166
and here you go.

42:24.202 --> 42:26.869
I'm so glad Lena's come.

42:26.871 --> 42:29.606
- She's a nice addition, huh?
- Mm hmm.

42:29.608 --> 42:31.276
I like her a lot.

42:31.910 --> 42:34.943
Oh, I gotta take care
of this before they come.

42:34.945 --> 42:36.211
- I wanna watch!
- Come on

42:36.213 --> 42:37.914
No, no, no, Kel. Uh uh.

42:37.916 --> 42:39.349
He's been eatin' our chickens!

42:39.351 --> 42:42.053
Pleeease, mom? Please?

42:44.055 --> 42:45.320
All right, look.
You can watch from the porch

42:45.322 --> 42:46.289
but no closer th...

42:46.291 --> 42:49.626
Oh! You can't see
nothin' from the porch!

42:57.068 --> 42:59.202
Sorry little fellah.

42:59.204 --> 43:01.803
In this world there is life

43:01.805 --> 43:03.809
and there is death

43:05.677 --> 43:08.077
and this-

43:08.079 --> 43:10.379
is your death.

44:04.202 --> 44:05.934
Give me a break. Really?

44:05.936 --> 44:06.936
What?

44:06.938 --> 44:09.305
Just keep digging.

44:09.307 --> 44:13.876
Dude. She's got a sick body,
what do you want from me?

44:13.878 --> 44:16.381
She's out of your league, bro.

44:18.916 --> 44:22.952
Ahh! Why are we doing this
shit now anyways, you know?

44:22.954 --> 44:24.921
It's November.

44:24.923 --> 44:29.392
The ground is still soft
enough. Kellen knows that.

44:29.394 --> 44:31.096
Oh, really?

44:32.097 --> 44:36.101
- Stop it, Jimbo.
- She knows Kellen already, huh?

44:36.334 --> 44:38.901
I saw the way he looked at you.

44:38.903 --> 44:40.736
I think our new friend here
might have a little bit of a

44:40.738 --> 44:43.338
"daddy complex.
Just like that Sienna chick.

44:43.340 --> 44:47.977
Shut up, dude,
you're making an ass out of yourself.

44:47.979 --> 44:49.044
Oh, it's all right.

44:49.046 --> 44:50.512
Why do you have
to be such a douchebag?

44:50.514 --> 44:52.849
Huh? She can take it.

44:52.851 --> 44:55.218
She's a tough little
daddy's girl. Aren't you?

44:55.220 --> 44:59.287
One more word,
motherfucker. Fuck this.

44:59.289 --> 45:00.992
I'm outta here.

45:01.825 --> 45:04.260
I'm sorry, I was just-

45:04.262 --> 45:05.827
Real smooth, Jimbo.

45:05.829 --> 45:09.000
Hate to watch her go,
love to watch her leave.

45:18.943 --> 45:20.446
Hey.

45:21.845 --> 45:23.347
Hi.

45:29.553 --> 45:32.157
Some days are
harder than others.

45:34.526 --> 45:38.394
Susan showed up
from kindergarten.

45:38.396 --> 45:42.030
with a
chrysanthemum in her hair.

45:42.032 --> 45:45.369
Declaring it was her
new favorite flower.

45:47.137 --> 45:49.207
It's just so hard.

45:52.142 --> 45:55.845
But coming here,

45:55.847 --> 45:59.251
it just makes me feel
like she's, she's safe.

46:02.486 --> 46:04.490
God, I am a mess.

46:06.390 --> 46:09.360
Why aren't in you in
the field with the others?

46:13.831 --> 46:16.032
Let's go get a cup
of tea at the house.

46:16.034 --> 46:18.035
Yeah? Okay.

46:40.457 --> 46:43.992
So, have you been enjoying
your time on the farm so far?

46:43.994 --> 46:47.095
- Yeah, yeah it's been great.
- Good, good.

46:47.097 --> 46:51.466
I mean, I kinda butt heads
with one of the workers, but,

46:51.468 --> 46:54.570
I don't know, I guess
that's just the way it goes.

46:54.572 --> 46:56.905
Mmm.

46:56.907 --> 46:58.041
Yeah.

46:58.043 --> 47:00.276
We'd be better off without
some of the disrespectful

47:00.278 --> 47:04.180
kids my husband hires.

47:04.182 --> 47:07.182
They serve
some purpose I suppose.

47:07.184 --> 47:09.017
You know, I really like Sadie.

47:09.019 --> 47:13.655
Well, Sadie gushes about you
every time she talks about you.

47:13.657 --> 47:17.193
Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

47:17.195 --> 47:22.497
No, I'm an only child. My
dad died when I was little and,

47:22.499 --> 47:24.966
you know, it's just
been me and my mom ever since.

47:24.968 --> 47:27.068
Oh, I'm so sorry.

47:27.070 --> 47:33.041
No, it's okay.
He died in a car wreck.

47:33.043 --> 47:35.244
You know, what you
said earlier, about Susan

47:35.246 --> 47:37.479
and her favorite flower.

47:37.481 --> 47:40.515
I have a memory
like that about my dad.

47:40.517 --> 47:44.553
You know, it's so funny
how one thing sticks out

47:44.555 --> 47:47.155
about somebody that you've lost.

47:47.157 --> 47:51.026
I just-I remember
going to the playground

47:51.028 --> 47:54.597
and uh, there
was this big slide.

47:54.599 --> 47:57.934
And I remember being on
top and I was so nervous,

47:57.936 --> 48:00.669
so nervous to slide down.

48:00.671 --> 48:05.640
And then I-I saw his
hands, and I felt so safe.

48:05.642 --> 48:07.345
Oh, sweetie.

48:09.981 --> 48:12.213
I got a pheasant!
First one ever! Can you believe it?

48:12.215 --> 48:14.216
They're so hard to get!

48:14.218 --> 48:16.519
Okay, you can
leave the bird outside.

48:16.521 --> 48:20.055
And you are going to pluck
and feather it yourself, missy!

48:20.057 --> 48:22.059
Why wouldn't I?

48:22.459 --> 48:23.725
Lena!

48:23.727 --> 48:25.561
Hey.

48:25.563 --> 48:28.267
Aww. Hi.

48:31.035 --> 48:32.468
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:32.470 --> 48:34.473
Don't I get a hug?

48:35.305 --> 48:38.110
Good job,
sweetie, good, good job.

48:38.977 --> 48:40.575
Thanks for being so welcoming.

48:40.577 --> 48:44.579
Come by any time,
the door's always open.

48:44.581 --> 48:46.182
See you later.

48:46.184 --> 48:47.686
See you.

49:09.273 --> 49:10.573
Hi.

49:10.575 --> 49:11.573
Hey.

49:11.575 --> 49:13.408
What's going on?

49:13.410 --> 49:17.579
Nothing. Just umm, spent some
time with your cousin actually.

49:17.581 --> 49:19.583
Come on, I'm taking you fishing.

49:22.253 --> 49:24.021
All right.

49:28.492 --> 49:29.691
Lean back and let it fly, right?

49:29.693 --> 49:34.629
Right at twelve o'clock you
let it go, you got this Lena.

49:34.631 --> 49:36.698
Hey! There you go.

49:36.700 --> 49:39.704
All right, flip the bail,
reel, reel, reel. Come on.

49:43.441 --> 49:47.609
Basically you do that all
day. Hope an Albie shows up,

49:47.611 --> 49:51.579
and when it does,
it's game on, cap.

49:51.581 --> 49:55.417
You wanna get
outta here? Go to Billy's?

49:55.419 --> 49:58.421
Absolutely. Gimme that.

49:58.423 --> 50:00.125
Let's go.

50:03.660 --> 50:06.195
Those guys are
fucking it up for everybody.

50:06.197 --> 50:08.263
I'm going out to George's
Bank in a couple of days,

50:08.265 --> 50:10.466
If those guys are out
there camping on my numbers,

50:10.468 --> 50:13.334
I swear to God I'm
gonna fuckin' kill somebody.

50:13.336 --> 50:17.273
Oh! look who's back in
town! Did you ever leave?

50:17.275 --> 50:19.642
Nope, just moved up-island.

50:19.644 --> 50:21.776
Look at you.

50:21.778 --> 50:24.412
- Hi honey.
- Hey, well don't stay too long,

50:24.414 --> 50:26.314
'cause you're gonna let
a quarter century slip by

50:26.316 --> 50:28.783
and they'll be
calling you a wash-a-shore.

50:28.785 --> 50:29.617
How you doin', Billy.

50:29.619 --> 50:31.387
I'm alright, man.

50:31.389 --> 50:34.122
We are still goin' out
to George's Bank, right?

50:34.124 --> 50:35.256
- Yeah.
- Right?

50:35.258 --> 50:36.457
Yeah.

50:36.459 --> 50:39.095
So uh, what are you, taking
a little break from the wild

50:39.097 --> 50:39.762
hearts club?

50:39.764 --> 50:41.696
Billy, I'll always be wild.

50:41.698 --> 50:42.865
Wild hearts?

50:42.867 --> 50:46.367
Yeah, wild hearts
can never be broken.

50:46.369 --> 50:49.704
The bite is on, Cap!
We gotta get out there,

50:49.706 --> 50:52.508
- I know.
- I gotta pay support to Joanne.

50:52.510 --> 50:54.843
We're going.
Don't worry about it.

50:54.845 --> 50:56.245
Lena!

50:56.247 --> 50:58.713
Oh, I can't.

50:58.715 --> 50:59.747
Hi.

50:59.749 --> 51:02.117
Hey Marge.

51:02.119 --> 51:03.718
We'll be in the back.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.724
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:11.528 --> 51:12.528
What'll it be?

51:12.530 --> 51:14.530
Can I switch up the music?

51:14.532 --> 51:16.865
Yeah, sure.

51:16.867 --> 51:19.901
Oh, yes. Thank God.

51:23.874 --> 51:29.211
Hey, Lena. Listen, I'm
real sorry about earlier.

51:29.213 --> 51:31.716
Let's play darts? Make nice?

51:32.483 --> 51:34.749
Um, nah, we're fine.

51:34.751 --> 51:37.887
Come on, it's just one
game, it's not gonna kill you.

51:37.889 --> 51:40.523
- Fuck it, we ll play you.
- 'Atta boy.

51:40.525 --> 51:42.892
Come on, Dev. Let's play
this kid and shut him up.

51:42.894 --> 51:45.097
Play for a beer?

51:46.764 --> 51:48.467
Oh!

52:05.782 --> 52:09.785
Yeah boy!
Jimbo-e-o-e-o

52:09.787 --> 52:12.290

52:14.392 --> 52:17.626
In your own house!

52:17.628 --> 52:21.332
Ooooohhh. In your own house!

52:21.898 --> 52:23.901
Let me get a shot.

52:29.807 --> 52:32.811
Mmm! Ohh.

52:38.515 --> 52:40.519
Hey, what the fuck dude!

52:41.952 --> 52:44.620
- You stup...
- What the! Fuck you, man!

52:44.622 --> 52:47.590
Hey, I'm alright. I'm alright.

52:47.592 --> 52:48.890
- We're good.
- Yup.

52:48.892 --> 52:51.593
I'm alright. Oh!!!

52:53.597 --> 52:54.930
Alright! Holy fu...

52:54.932 --> 52:56.832
Enough! That is enough!

52:56.834 --> 53:01.003
Too fuckin' far,
man! Too fuckin' far!

53:01.005 --> 53:03.207
Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

53:04.941 --> 53:06.975
He had it comin'.

53:06.977 --> 53:10.715
It's too much. It's too much.

53:11.381 --> 53:13.448
- Look I kn...
- What?

53:13.450 --> 53:14.716
I'm sorry.

53:14.718 --> 53:16.718
It's alright baby,

53:16.720 --> 53:20.021
listen Lena, you can stay,

53:20.023 --> 53:22.291
but your
friends, they gotta go.

53:22.293 --> 53:23.861
Okay.

53:32.470 --> 53:34.403
Are you coming with us?

53:34.405 --> 53:37.305
I'll meet you
guys back at the farm.

53:37.307 --> 53:38.809
Alright.

53:43.414 --> 53:45.347
What are you doin'
with those people?

53:45.349 --> 53:46.515
Do you want me to
help you clean up?

53:46.517 --> 53:49.417
Nah, no, I got everything.
It's all taken care of baby.

53:49.419 --> 53:51.486
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

53:51.488 --> 53:53.490
- It s alright.
- Sorry.

53:54.492 --> 53:58.693
Hey, look I'm sorry. Alright?

53:58.695 --> 54:01.629
Yeah, don't bother.

54:01.631 --> 54:05.901
- Listen, can we just uh-
- No.

54:05.903 --> 54:09.004
Billy, I gotta go.

54:09.006 --> 54:10.838
Alright. Take care of
yourself, sweetheart.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.508
- Thanks for everything.
- You got it.

54:12.510 --> 54:13.809
I'll stop back
in again real soon.

54:13.811 --> 54:15.680
Do that.

54:22.452 --> 54:25.689
Hey, one last shot
you piece of shit.

54:48.713 --> 54:51.646
You think you're
so fucking cool?

54:51.648 --> 54:55.950
My fucking cool
best friends over here.

54:55.952 --> 55:00.655
Fucking do my
fighting for me. Little pussy.

55:04.794 --> 55:08.097
Inbred motherfucking pussies.

56:27.744 --> 56:28.744
Hey Lena.

56:28.746 --> 56:33.448
Sadie?
What are you doing up there?

56:33.450 --> 56:36.050
I had a nightmare.

56:36.052 --> 56:37.988
About what?

56:40.023 --> 56:44.660
I don't want you to go missing.

56:44.662 --> 56:45.928
What are you talking about?

56:45.930 --> 56:49.534
All these people,
they're so silly.

56:54.472 --> 56:56.972
What's wrong? Huh?

56:56.974 --> 56:58.841
Please be careful, sis.

56:58.843 --> 57:06.481
I don't want
anything to happen to you.

57:06.483 --> 57:07.985
Come on.

57:13.023 --> 57:17.559
Nothing bad is gonna
happen to me or you, okay?

57:17.561 --> 57:20.064
Cause you're tough like me.

58:06.142 --> 58:08.776
Excuse me, listen up everyone.

58:08.778 --> 58:12.046
This is our way of saying thank
you fo-for all your hard work.

58:12.048 --> 58:14.149
And thanks for
working the off season.

58:14.151 --> 58:16.984
They're not always
the best conditions out there

58:16.986 --> 58:21.756
and I'm sorry that Jimbo
uh, couldn't make the roast.

58:21.758 --> 58:24.660
I'm sure he's having a
blast somewhere. Cheers!

58:24.662 --> 58:26.664
Cheers!

59:48.711 --> 59:53.247
Lena. Lena
what are you doing?

59:53.249 --> 59:56.151
Come here, you freak..

59:56.153 --> 59:59.220
I'm just so drunk.
I'm drunk. I'm drunk.

59:59.222 --> 01:00:02.226
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

01:00:04.394 --> 01:00:07.162
- Yeah, you found me.
- I was looking for you.

01:00:07.164 --> 01:00:11.233
Voila! You re buzzed.

01:00:11.235 --> 01:00:12.937
Me? Yeah

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.937
- I got news.
- Yeah?

01:00:15.939 --> 01:00:19.307
Yeah, we're
going to Vermont!

01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:21.276
- What?
- Yeah.

01:00:21.278 --> 01:00:23.211
- Wow!
- Yeah!!!

01:00:23.213 --> 01:00:25.713
When?
Soon. Real soon.

01:00:25.715 --> 01:00:27.883
Like fuckin' days.

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:30.084
Bart has this friend up in
Putney and he's not even

01:00:30.086 --> 01:00:32.754
gonna be there, so we can stay.

01:00:32.756 --> 01:00:36.761
Bart has this bug up his
ass, so now he's ready to go.

01:00:37.327 --> 01:00:40.162
That's great for you guys. Tha...

01:00:40.164 --> 01:00:42.763
Come on, doll, you'll
come up and visit.

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:45.834
Vermont is wicked
cool. Nice people, too.

01:00:45.836 --> 01:00:48.003
I'm just gonna miss you.

01:00:48.005 --> 01:00:50.838
I'll miss you too.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.274
I don't know I
just feel like I've-

01:00:53.276 --> 01:00:56.945
found a family here.

01:00:56.947 --> 01:01:01.783
No, really.
Like you and-and Sadie.

01:01:01.785 --> 01:01:05.086
Oh, she's a hot shit.
She's a cool little farm kid.

01:01:05.088 --> 01:01:07.354
She's one of the good ones.

01:01:07.356 --> 01:01:09.323
I don't know, I'm
kind of worried about her.

01:01:09.325 --> 01:01:12.994
Oh, I wouldn't.
She can handle herself.

01:01:12.996 --> 01:01:16.198
You know, she
stole your circus hat.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.434
What? I knew it! God
know she is always taking shi...

01:01:20.436 --> 01:01:22.269
She denied it,
but it's totally there.

01:01:22.271 --> 01:01:24.071
Alright, you know
what? She can keep it.

01:01:24.073 --> 01:01:25.240
It's my gift to her.

01:01:25.242 --> 01:01:27.242
It's in that neighbor's
basement. She calls it like her

01:01:27.244 --> 01:01:28.376
secret hiding pla...

01:01:28.378 --> 01:01:30.345
Ah, Yeah, Bart
helped her set that up.

01:01:30.347 --> 01:01:31.445
- Yeah?!
- Yeah.

01:01:31.447 --> 01:01:34.381
She's got this whole
world she's created down there.

01:01:34.383 --> 01:01:36.517
- It's incredible.
- Well, you must be special.

01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:39.086
I mean I never got an
invite to go down there.

01:01:39.088 --> 01:01:40.521
- No?
- No.

01:01:40.523 --> 01:01:43.390
So, why do you
wanna go so bad?

01:01:43.392 --> 01:01:48.497
I don't, I could live anywhere,
you know. And I love the water.

01:01:48.499 --> 01:01:53.267
But, uh, it's just, this place
ain't right for Bartholomew.

01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:54.369
He's from here.

01:01:54.371 --> 01:01:58.106
Yeah, but you can spend
too much time in a place.

01:01:58.108 --> 01:02:01.108
He's got so much
history on this island.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:05.379
Once they label you around here,
good luck shedding that tag.

01:02:05.381 --> 01:02:11.486
I don't know I-My island
history is just beginning.

01:03:55.025 --> 01:03:58.193
Is this Emily's sweatshirt?

01:03:58.195 --> 01:04:00.128
Where the hell
did you find this?

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:01.930
Sadie gave it to me.

01:04:01.932 --> 01:04:05.100
Why does she
have it? Creepy little bitch.

01:04:05.102 --> 01:04:07.135
What do you mean? It
was in a big box of clothes.

01:04:07.137 --> 01:04:08.436
We were playing
dress-up the other day.

01:04:08.438 --> 01:04:10.399
Emily never took this off.

01:04:41.867 --> 01:04:44.434
Sadie's a little clepto.

01:04:44.436 --> 01:04:46.903
She's actually a
really good kid, Marge.

01:04:46.905 --> 01:04:47.737
There's gotta be a reason f...

01:04:47.739 --> 01:04:50.440
You just want to
like them so much.

01:04:50.442 --> 01:04:51.740
And what's wrong with that?

01:04:51.742 --> 01:04:54.811
It was Emily's
brothers' sweatshirt.

01:04:54.813 --> 01:04:57.516
She wore his
dog tags, too-

01:05:01.719 --> 01:05:05.256
Come on, we gotta go. I don't
wanna here Kellen bitching.

01:05:10.695 --> 01:05:12.231
Yeah.

01:05:23.641 --> 01:05:26.476
Where the hell is Jimbo?

01:05:26.478 --> 01:05:29.481
I don't know. He
didn't come back last night.

01:05:31.315 --> 01:05:33.318
Fine by me.

01:05:40.659 --> 01:05:44.327
I gotta clear the back
path by the south end, so-

01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:48.197
Yo-you and Zoe head down
there, grab the trimmers and

01:05:48.199 --> 01:05:51.934
the hand tools,
cut back the fence line and

01:05:51.936 --> 01:05:53.802
brush cut the paths, alright?
We haven't been down there in a

01:05:53.804 --> 01:05:54.771
while. It's probably a-

01:05:54.773 --> 01:05:56.639
Got it.

01:05:56.641 --> 01:05:59.275
I need you to do
some chores on the farm.

01:05:59.277 --> 01:06:01.577
Hay to the cows, feed the pigs.

01:06:01.579 --> 01:06:03.345
I hate feeding
those stupid things-

01:06:03.347 --> 01:06:05.347
Cassie.

01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:06.851
Fine.

01:06:08.286 --> 01:06:09.851
How about you work in the field.

01:06:09.853 --> 01:06:12.655
Alright, just clear that big
brush pile and dump it in the

01:06:12.657 --> 01:06:16.662
field by the pond at the end of
the day. Alright, simple enough?

01:06:18.862 --> 01:06:24.499
Take a truck over to Phelps.

01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:26.836
You know where that is?

01:06:26.838 --> 01:06:28.637
You leave the
farm, make a left.

01:06:28.639 --> 01:06:29.838
Yeah, I know. I've
been there with Todd.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.943
Okay, take the clippers and
loppers and just cut back all

01:06:33.945 --> 01:06:36.481
the shrubs for winter, alright?

01:06:38.516 --> 01:06:40.219
You alright?

01:06:40.619 --> 01:06:42.621
Yeah. I'm alright.

01:07:09.648 --> 01:07:11.914
Do you ever bend
your knees when you lop?

01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:13.615
Wait, I do, don't I?

01:07:13.617 --> 01:07:15.050
- No.
- Really?

01:07:15.052 --> 01:07:18.987
Wait, that's so weird.
Wait, my god, you're so right.

01:07:18.989 --> 01:07:20.692
That's weird.

01:07:21.793 --> 01:07:24.663
Hey, so I was thinking, um-

01:07:25.664 --> 01:07:28.667
would you think about
coming to Boston with me?

01:07:30.434 --> 01:07:31.936
Maybe.

01:07:32.804 --> 01:07:34.670
That sounds like a yes.

01:07:34.672 --> 01:07:36.338
Why don't you get back to work.

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.441
That sounds like a
yes ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:38.443 --> 01:07:40.312
That sounds like a yes!

01:08:37.501 --> 01:08:40.068
Hey, Zoe?

01:08:40.069 --> 01:08:42.774
Did I leave my
hedgers over there?

01:08:54.984 --> 01:08:56.520
Zoe?

01:09:00.657 --> 01:09:02.527
Are you sleeping?

01:09:49.974 --> 01:09:51.676
Stupid pigs.

01:10:20.238 --> 01:10:22.441
Help me!

01:11:35.613 --> 01:11:38.647
You're not a pretty girl!
You're not a pretty girl!

01:11:38.649 --> 01:11:40.652
You'r not a pretty girl!

01:11:48.725 --> 01:11:50.728
I can't trust anyone!

01:11:52.162 --> 01:11:54.165
You're an ugly girl!

01:12:16.921 --> 01:12:18.923
What the fuck.

01:12:26.764 --> 01:12:29.768
Okay guys,
seriously. Stop fucking around.

01:12:44.849 --> 01:12:48.854
Sadie Is that you?
Ugh, creepy little bitch.

01:12:58.095 --> 01:13:01.630
- Hello, Marg...
- Jesus! Becca!

01:13:01.632 --> 01:13:03.635
Have you seen
my "little bitch"?!

01:13:20.917 --> 01:13:23.184
Where did you get that?

01:13:23.186 --> 01:13:25.053
Sadie, why do you
have Jimbo's hat?

01:13:25.055 --> 01:13:27.790
I told you to never go to
my secret place without me!

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:29.959
I trusted you. I
thought you were my sister!

01:13:29.961 --> 01:13:31.826
Sadie, that's still true. Okay?

01:13:31.828 --> 01:13:33.862
But I have to know
where you got those clothes.

01:13:33.864 --> 01:13:35.964
Why! Why did you break
our pact! You're just like the

01:13:35.966 --> 01:13:39.971
rest of them! You're all
liars, I hate you! I hate you!

01:13:41.773 --> 01:13:44.275
I thought you were different.

01:13:46.411 --> 01:13:48.343
What the hell is going on?

01:13:48.345 --> 01:13:50.348
She lied to me, daddy!

01:13:52.283 --> 01:13:54.083
Go do your chores.

01:13:54.085 --> 01:13:56.087
Daddy, she lied!

01:13:58.322 --> 01:13:59.324
Go.

01:14:13.404 --> 01:14:16.408
Let s go inside,
Lena. Let's talk.

01:14:32.256 --> 01:14:33.959
Sit down.

01:14:48.905 --> 01:14:51.139
Don t be afraid.

01:14:51.141 --> 01:14:53.174
Where's Jimbo?

01:14:53.176 --> 01:14:55.210
I don't know.

01:14:55.212 --> 01:14:57.916
He didn't leave
the island, did he?

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.756
I want you to tell me

01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:11.527
how you feel about Sadie.

01:15:11.529 --> 01:15:14.796
- She's a special girl.
- She likes you, very much.

01:15:14.798 --> 01:15:17.135
For her that's rare.

01:15:20.003 --> 01:15:24.373
I've never seen
her warm to anyone.

01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:27.242
Like she has with you.

01:15:27.244 --> 01:15:29.480
I'm scared for her.

01:15:42.993 --> 01:15:44.862
Susan,

01:15:45.395 --> 01:15:48.563
our first daughter.

01:15:48.565 --> 01:15:52.433
When she was sixteen,

01:15:52.435 --> 01:15:55.204
she got a job.

01:15:55.206 --> 01:15:57.976
Down-island in the coffee shop.

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:03.912
There was this summer
dink. His name was Tucker.

01:16:03.914 --> 01:16:06.115
He took a liking to her.

01:16:06.117 --> 01:16:09.184
Boarding school kid, eighteen,

01:16:09.186 --> 01:16:10.885
came from money.

01:16:10.887 --> 01:16:15.290
Had that rich, cockiness
about him. I didn't like him.

01:16:15.292 --> 01:16:18.126
But Susan did.

01:16:18.128 --> 01:16:21.132
Becca told me to give her space,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.433
so I did.

01:16:24.435 --> 01:16:27.369
Tucker took her
down to the pond.

01:16:27.371 --> 01:16:29.905
Bartholomew was down there,

01:16:29.907 --> 01:16:33.174
way up at the head, fishing.

01:16:33.176 --> 01:16:36.180
He heard Susan scream.

01:16:36.881 --> 01:16:41.386
By the time he got down there,
Tucker looked back at him,

01:16:42.118 --> 01:16:45.454
right before he
disappeared into the woods-

01:16:45.456 --> 01:16:48.326
and when he got to Susan,

01:16:48.559 --> 01:16:51.262
she was already dead.

01:16:52.462 --> 01:16:54.465
Oh my God.

01:16:56.466 --> 01:17:00.201
People saw him
around the island and he-

01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:03.541
acted like nothing had happened.

01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:10.612
I'm so sorry.

01:17:10.614 --> 01:17:14.415
So we followed him one night,

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:17.121
down to the beach.

01:17:18.456 --> 01:17:20.488
Idiot,

01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:23.494
he walked right into us.

01:17:27.398 --> 01:17:30.101
So I held him down

01:17:34.505 --> 01:17:38.510
and Becca split
his skull open with an ax.

01:17:42.145 --> 01:17:44.849
And I thought we were done.

01:17:48.586 --> 01:17:50.588
She liked it.

01:17:59.363 --> 01:18:04.066
A big team of fancy,
city lawyers would have made

01:18:04.068 --> 01:18:08.073
Susan out to be a whore.
That kid would have walked!

01:18:09.573 --> 01:18:13.445
And there's no way
that was gonna happen.

01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:27.893
Becca.

01:18:32.496 --> 01:18:35.330
What did you do to the others?

01:18:35.332 --> 01:18:36.565
He didn't do anything!

01:18:36.567 --> 01:18:38.569
Sweetheart.

01:18:47.011 --> 01:18:49.014
I'm gonna go now.

01:18:51.181 --> 01:18:55.049
- Where the fuck!! Ahh!
- Ahh!

01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:57.553
Ahhh!

01:19:08.332 --> 01:19:11.336
Nooooo! Becca!!

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.481
Sienna!

01:19:25.483 --> 01:19:26.081
What?

01:19:26.083 --> 01:19:29.117
- Sienna!
- What? What?

01:19:29.119 --> 01:19:30.385
- Everybody's dead.
- What?

01:19:30.387 --> 01:19:32.720
Kellen was just telling me this
story of Becca killed this guy-

01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:34.623
Okay, you gotta calm
down cause you're talking crazy.

01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:38.059
She killed the guy that killed
Susan! Susan was fuckin'

01:19:38.061 --> 01:19:41.263
murdered, Sienna. Jimbo has
been gone for days, do you,

01:19:41.265 --> 01:19:45.233
- do you fuckin' trust me!?
- Yes! Yes I fuckin' trust you!

01:19:45.235 --> 01:19:46.802
Then we have to get
the fuck out of here now!

01:19:46.804 --> 01:19:49.103
I'm with you, but
we gotta find Bart.

01:19:49.105 --> 01:19:52.607
I'm not going anywhere
without him! Let's go.

01:19:52.609 --> 01:19:55.643
Over here, over here.

01:19:55.645 --> 01:19:59.080
Bart!

01:19:59.082 --> 01:20:02.217
Baby answer me! Bart!

01:20:02.219 --> 01:20:04.652
- Come on! Bart! Baby! Get up.
- What?

01:20:04.654 --> 01:20:09.458
Baby we gotta go! We
gotta get outta here! This it.

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.061
It's Becca.

01:20:12.462 --> 01:20:13.262
Becca.

01:20:13.264 --> 01:20:16.467
Come on, we
gotta get to the boat.

01:20:37.822 --> 01:20:40.289
Get in the boat!
Get in the Boat.

01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:42.790
- Push it.
- I got it.

01:20:42.792 --> 01:20:45.697
Come on. Come on, baby.

01:20:47.864 --> 01:20:50.068
Go! Go!

01:20:51.335 --> 01:20:55.403
No! Stop it! Stop it!

01:20:55.405 --> 01:20:57.705
Ahh! Ahh!! Ahh!

01:20:57.707 --> 01:21:01.375
Baby, I got you, baby. Baby.

01:21:01.377 --> 01:21:05.781
It's o-it's okay. Honey

01:21:05.783 --> 01:21:08.616
