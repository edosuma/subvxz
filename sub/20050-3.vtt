00:14.056 --> 00:15.474
It still feels weird
coming back here

00:15.558 --> 00:16.976
after being gone for so long.

00:17.059 --> 00:20.104
Hey, Mrs. Johnson!
Lawn's looking good!

00:20.187 --> 00:21.981
But, you know, we got all
the tables and lights set up,

00:22.064 --> 00:23.482
so hopefully,
we'll have everybody

00:23.566 --> 00:25.401
that's been growing
vegetables for Bubs

00:25.484 --> 00:27.653
switched over to growing clones
by the end of the day.

00:27.737 --> 00:30.489
I mean, that's the plan, anyway.
Donnie:
Dirty fucking whore slut!

00:30.573 --> 00:33.576
Jesus, Donnie! You're
going to have a fucking
heart attack, buddy!

00:33.659 --> 00:35.745
Fuck you!

00:35.828 --> 00:37.997
That guy's so fucked.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.458
So, you know. I really
don't know how I feel
about coming back here.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.294
I mean, Bubbles and Ricky,
they're like my brothers

00:43.377 --> 00:44.670
and I do miss
hanging out with them

00:44.754 --> 00:46.380
but they seem
to be doing pretty good

00:46.464 --> 00:50.175
without me being around,
so... you know, who knows?

00:50.259 --> 00:51.761
But one thing I don't miss

00:51.844 --> 00:53.429
is the constant fucking
nightmares and bullshit

00:53.512 --> 00:55.556
you've got to deal with
living in Sunnyvale.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.558
Okay, Motel, no big deal.

00:57.642 --> 01:00.394
Just sit there like that.
That's great.

01:00.478 --> 01:03.272
What the hell?
Ricky:
That's it.

01:03.355 --> 01:06.066
Julian:
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

01:06.150 --> 01:08.068
(Squeaking,
emergency brake clicking)

01:08.152 --> 01:11.405
Ricky:
Here comes grampie.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.908
Julian:
What in the fuck
is going on here, boys?

01:13.992 --> 01:16.076
Ricky:
Okay, just down on
the groundie-woundie

01:16.160 --> 01:17.578
for Grampie-wampie.
All right?

01:17.662 --> 01:20.372
Ricky, how the fuck
did he get that?
No idea.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.249
Well, you better hope
the fucking safety's on.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.585
Of course the
fucking safety's on!
I'm not a idiot!

01:24.669 --> 01:26.420
(Click)
Oh, fuck, he just
turned it off.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.714
I'm going to
have to go in.
Oh, Ricky!

01:28.798 --> 01:30.508
Ricky, what
are you doing?
Ah, fuck!

01:30.591 --> 01:32.134
It's a habit.
I'm sorry.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.595
How in the Christ did
fucking Mo get a handgun?

01:34.679 --> 01:36.472
He must have
found it in the car.
I don't know.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.683
I've been looking for
that gun for three years.
I love that gun.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.726
Oh, he's got your
favourite gun, does he?

01:40.810 --> 01:42.812
Fuck.
Okay, Mo, just point
it at the ground.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.313
Just point it
at the ground.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.815
Grampie's going to
come and get it, okay?

01:45.898 --> 01:47.149
Bubbles:
Ricky, be careful.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.901
That's it, just
pass it to Grampie.

01:48.985 --> 01:50.277
That's a good boy.

01:50.361 --> 01:52.112
(Gunshot)
(Screaming)

01:52.196 --> 01:53.447
Bubbles:
Ricky! Ricky!

01:53.531 --> 01:55.115
Oh, Jesus' fucking horse-cock!

01:55.199 --> 01:56.993
Mo just blew my
fucking nuts off!
Bubbles:
Ricky!

01:57.076 --> 01:58.619
Oh, my fuck!
What?

01:58.703 --> 02:00.788
(Anguished screech)
Ricky!

02:00.872 --> 02:03.666
(Theme music)

02:42.580 --> 02:44.415
(Crying)
Ricky: It's okay, Mo.
Grampie's okay.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.250
It's okay, little buddy.
It's not your fault.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.710
Grampie's just
fucked in the head.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.420
Yeah... yeah.
(Wailing)

02:49.503 --> 02:51.005
It looks like
both your nuts are
still there Ricky,

02:51.089 --> 02:53.173
but there's a big hole
in your duffel bag.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.718
(Crying)

02:55.801 --> 02:58.763
Here, sweetie.
What the fuck happened?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.056
Aw, is he okay?

03:00.139 --> 03:01.640
(Crying)

03:01.724 --> 03:04.518
I can't believe you let
Mo play with a handgun!

03:04.602 --> 03:07.354
I didn't let him.
He must have
found it somewhere.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.941
All I can say,
Ricky, is "wow".

03:10.024 --> 03:13.569
Not now, Sarah, please.
Wow-w-w.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.113
Let's go.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.698
(Ricky panting)

03:17.782 --> 03:19.075
Okay, Ricky.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.744
Let me just have a look.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.204
There is one little
tube thing hanging
out the side here...

03:24.288 --> 03:25.873
Oh, fuck me, Jesus!

03:25.957 --> 03:28.250
Jesus Christ!
It's connected to
something, is it?

03:28.333 --> 03:29.543
Yeah, my nut!

03:29.627 --> 03:31.378
Oh, sorry, Ricky.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.255
Here, it just...
doesn't look like

03:33.338 --> 03:35.967
there's a whole lot of
damage to the inside.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.927
Just get that, just...
Looks workable.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.637
Julian:
Well, glue the fucking
thing shut, man.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.430
Glue me?

03:41.513 --> 03:43.265
When you're six miles out
to sea and you cut yourself,

03:43.348 --> 03:45.392
you just can't go
to the hospital.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.561
Best thing you can
do, and a lot of people
don't know this,

03:47.645 --> 03:50.564
but you can use Krazy Glue
to seal up the cut.
Works perfect.

03:50.648 --> 03:54.401
Normally I wouldn't grab on
to Ricky's bare genitals
like that with my hands

03:54.485 --> 03:58.197
but he's one of my best
friends and this is an
emergency situation.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.616
That's what best friends do,
get right in there!

04:00.699 --> 04:01.909
(Clicking tongue)

04:01.993 --> 04:04.745
Fuck's sakes, that's the...

04:04.829 --> 04:06.622
(Straining)
end of the glue right there

04:06.705 --> 04:08.958
but you're fucking sealed up
pretty tight there now, Ricky.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.085
Ah, fuck! How
does it look?

04:11.169 --> 04:13.462
Well, if I'm being
completely honest,

04:13.545 --> 04:15.131
it kind of looks like a...

04:15.214 --> 04:17.591
fresh-out-of-the-oven heaping
portion of blueberry grunt

04:17.675 --> 04:20.803
crushed into a roadmap
and covered in matted hair.
(Chuckling)

04:20.886 --> 04:22.972
What the fuck
does that mean?

04:23.055 --> 04:26.558
Let's just say I'd...
cancel any boudoir
photography appointments

04:26.642 --> 04:28.602
you have booked for
the next couple of weeks.
(Wheezing laughter)

04:28.686 --> 04:31.271
Any what?
Okay, boys,
come on, let's go.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.315
We've got a lot
of work to do.
Get up, Rick.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.068
Just wait, a lot of work
to do? Julian, he needs
medical attention.

04:36.152 --> 04:38.403
No, he doesn't.
He's fine, man. Look.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.280
Ah, fuck!
No more gooey shit.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.033
We're all clean.
Let's go.
Julian!

04:42.116 --> 04:43.575
That is some
of my best work

04:43.659 --> 04:45.036
but I can't guarantee
that's going to hold.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.787
He needs medical
attention.

04:46.871 --> 04:49.498
We're fucking going
for it right now.
Case closed.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.125
Oh, fuck.
All right.

04:51.209 --> 04:52.626
Medical attention.
That's what we'll do.

04:52.710 --> 04:55.171
Thanks, Julian.
All right,
no problem, bud.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.464
Bubbles:
Try to keep your
legs together, Ricky.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.134
One more time, boys.
Two parts of the green shit,

05:00.218 --> 05:02.136
one part of the blue shit,
not two, Cory,

05:02.220 --> 05:04.263
and half a part of
the fucking pink shit.
Do you got it?

05:04.346 --> 05:06.807
Yeah, totally, dude.
But what's a part?

05:06.891 --> 05:08.851
Holy fuck, you guys
are stupider than
fucking June bugs.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.477
The dumbest fucking thing
on the planet, aren't you?

05:10.561 --> 05:12.646
I know what a part is.
Don't worry, Ricky, man.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.815
We got this.
Why are you guys
talking about parts?

05:14.899 --> 05:16.192
What are you making?
Fuck off!

05:16.275 --> 05:17.651
We're talking about
my parts, Randy,

05:17.735 --> 05:19.195
which ones you might
want to tongue-lick.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.989
My fucking balls, my cock,
my hole or my tits.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.199
Take your pick.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.159
Haha, very funny, Ricky.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.619
Why do you got chicken
fingers on your privates?

05:27.703 --> 05:29.163
'Cause it feels fucking
wonderful, Randy.

05:29.247 --> 05:30.706
I'm pretending they're
your fucking mother.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.332
(Laughs)
Oh my God.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.044
I want you out of
the park, Julian, now!

05:35.127 --> 05:37.004
Make me.

05:37.088 --> 05:39.006
Make you?
Yeah.

05:39.090 --> 05:41.884
You want me out of the
park, fucking make me.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.510
Okay, I will.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.679
All right, do it
then! Make me!

05:45.763 --> 05:46.931
What are you? Scared?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.682
'Fraidy-cat,
'fraidy-cat!

05:48.766 --> 05:50.684
You want me to make you
get out of the park?

05:50.768 --> 05:54.230
Yes, I do. Make me.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.856
All right,
you asked for it.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.025
Ah! Ah! Aaah! Ahh!

05:58.109 --> 05:59.484
Julian! Julian!

05:59.568 --> 06:01.403
Let go, Julian!
It hurts. Julian!

06:01.486 --> 06:03.030
Julian!

06:03.114 --> 06:04.865
Uh!
You're out of
your league, Randy.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.825
Now fuck off!

06:06.909 --> 06:08.286
That frigging
hurt, Julian!

06:08.368 --> 06:10.037
Ricky:
Fucking pussy!

06:10.121 --> 06:12.957
You got honker
stomped, Randy!
Fucking honker stomped.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.209
(Panting)
Take it easy, man.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.544
Keep everything
cinched together, Ricky.
(Squirrel chirping)

06:17.628 --> 06:19.755
You think this is
fucking funny, do you,
you little fucker!

06:19.838 --> 06:21.548
Ricky! Ricky...
Ahh-ahh-ah! Fuck!

06:21.632 --> 06:22.883
Here, shoot him, Bubs!
Shoot him!

06:22.967 --> 06:25.219
I'm not shooting
a squirrel.

06:25.303 --> 06:27.721
Bubs, give him a hand.
This thing is fucked!

06:27.805 --> 06:30.308
Why don't you get a
fucking normal-person-Jeep?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.392
This is normal
fucking Jeep.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.771
Yeah, a normal person
Jeep if you're G.I. Joe.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.440
Fuck's sakes!

06:38.523 --> 06:40.525
â™ª G.I. Jo-o-oe â™ª

06:42.361 --> 06:44.738
Randy:
Officer Randy, continuing
my investigation.

06:44.822 --> 06:47.699
I'm now located
at 18 Elm Lake Road.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.535
Cory:
Yo, that was the best
explaining I ever heard, dude.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.371
Jacob:
Yeah, I really got into
the zone there, didn't I?

06:52.454 --> 06:54.123
Yeah man, talking
about the colours

06:54.206 --> 06:55.958
and the parts right
and shit, man.
That was awesome!

06:56.041 --> 06:58.127
Man, you should do this one.
I think you can do it.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.087
All right.

07:00.171 --> 07:01.755
Marguerite:
Yeah?

07:06.218 --> 07:07.970
What?
Hey, Marguerite.
Ricky wants us to come by

07:08.053 --> 07:10.097
and go over the new
set-up with you.
Is that cool?

07:10.181 --> 07:12.599
Oh, what? I can't be
bothered with that
bullshit right now!

07:12.683 --> 07:14.101
My fucking shows are on.

07:14.185 --> 07:16.103
Well, it's not
going to take long

07:16.187 --> 07:18.814
and Ricky will be really
pissed if we don't
do this now. Please!

07:18.897 --> 07:20.858
Oh, Jesus Christ!
All right.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.486
Come on in,
you little pissants!

07:24.569 --> 07:28.282
You can show me
all that when the
commercials are on.

07:28.366 --> 07:31.535
Suspects have entered
the residence of
Marguerite Murphy,

07:31.618 --> 07:35.122
a definite indicator of the
suspicious criminal activity

07:35.206 --> 07:37.249
taking place in
Sunnyvale trailer park.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.836
Bubbles:
See if you can
wrap them, Ricky.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.713
You want surface area.
Ricky:
Ahh.. ahhh.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.464
Julian:
Okay, I'm going to go
inside and set shit up.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.175
You guys wait here.
Ricky:
Right on, Julian.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.135
What? Where the
fuck are we?
Sam Losco's.

07:48.219 --> 07:50.512
Losco's? Are you
fucking crazy?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.723
There's no way that
fuckhead's going anywhere
near my nuts, Julian!

07:52.806 --> 07:54.474
You said we were
going to the hospital.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.185
No, I said we were going
to get medical attention.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.686
That's what the
fuck we're doing.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.522
Julian, he needs to see
a fucking real doctor,

08:00.605 --> 08:02.983
not a slobbering Neanderthal
caveman veterinarian.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.444
Okay, we're going to
stroll into the hospital
and say, "Hey, everybody!

08:05.527 --> 08:07.946
Ricky's grandson got a
hold of a fucking handgun

08:08.030 --> 08:09.656
and blew his nuts off."
Is that the plan?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.658
Oh, boys, everything's
going numb.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.577
My fucking cock, my balls,
my jungle bridge,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.329
even my ass.
Jungle bridge?

08:15.413 --> 08:17.622
What the fuck is your
jungle bridge, Ricky?

08:17.706 --> 08:19.833
You know, the place where
your vagin-er would be
if you fucking had one.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.668
But it's like a bridge
from your ass to your balls,

08:21.752 --> 08:23.712
and it's jungle-y...
a fucking jungle bridge!

08:23.795 --> 08:27.174
No, Ricky, the technical term
for that area is perineum.

08:27.258 --> 08:28.759
But it's also
commonly referred to

08:28.842 --> 08:30.552
as your taint,
your gooch or your choda.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.179
I don't give a fuck
what the medical term is!

08:33.264 --> 08:35.682
Mine needs to see a doctor
at the fucking hospital!

08:35.765 --> 08:38.518
A real doctor's not a
fucking option, Ricky!

08:38.602 --> 08:40.520
Okay, fine.
Fine, Julian.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.857
So we just let our
best friend suffer
a slow painful death

08:43.941 --> 08:46.318
bleeding out through
a Krazy Glued gunshot
hole in his nutsack

08:46.402 --> 08:48.570
and then we just go about
our business like nothing
fucking happened.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.364
(Clicking)
Is that the plan, then?

08:50.448 --> 08:52.157
<i>We're talking
about my nuts. My nuts!</i>

08:52.241 --> 08:54.159
Okay! Not some
unimportant
part of my body

08:54.243 --> 08:55.660
like an arm
or a leg or head!

08:55.744 --> 08:58.038
I want to go to the
fucking hospital!

08:58.122 --> 09:00.082
Okay. You guys win.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.875
We're going to go to
the fucking hospital.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.961
Because you guys always
know what's best, huh?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.088
Yes! Yes, we do.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.798
Now, Ricky, get those
frozen chicken fingers

09:07.881 --> 09:09.591
under your balls
for support.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.343
Can you cradle them, Bubs?

09:11.427 --> 09:13.512
Cradle what? Your balls
or the chicken fingers?

09:13.595 --> 09:16.390
Both, if you're okay
with that. Oh, my god.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.476
How's that?
That's fucking perfect.
Thanks, buddy.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.770
Bubbles:
Come on, Ricky.
(Car door shuts)

09:21.853 --> 09:23.772
Careful.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.441
Careful.
Ricky:
Okay...

09:25.524 --> 09:27.318
Julian:
Easy.
Ahh, fuck!

09:27.401 --> 09:29.069
Jesus!

09:29.153 --> 09:31.322
These fucking
things are thawed.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.990
Thanks for doing this,
Julian, man. You're
a good fucking friend.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.908
Hey, man, you've got to
do what you've got to do.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.827
This is a fucking
serious situation...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.413
Hey, easy.

09:39.497 --> 09:41.748
All right, boys.
We've got to get
our story together

09:41.832 --> 09:43.750
before we go in there.
All right?
Okay.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.420
You were lighting
fireworks off, one went
down your pants...

09:46.504 --> 09:48.755
Yeah.
...burned a bullet-sized
hole right through your bag.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.467
There's no other
damages, no burn marks,
no nothing, right?

09:51.550 --> 09:54.094
Perfect.
Okay, let's do this.
Let's give it a shot.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.930
If we end up in jail,
at least we tried, right?

09:57.014 --> 09:58.640
What are you talking
about jail for?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.184
You said this could work.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.852
Yeah, it could work
but, then again,

10:01.935 --> 10:04.229
it could not
work, obviously,
and if that happens,

10:04.313 --> 10:06.357
the cops are going to
be involved. Let's go.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.733
Well, can we fucking
worry about that when
it happens, at least?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.652
You're right.
It's not a big deal.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.904
You know. They start
investigating this thing.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.448
Once they find out
it's a bullet wound,

10:14.532 --> 10:16.616
and, you know, they'll
trace it back to Mo.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.285
You'll lose
him forever,

10:18.369 --> 10:20.287
but that's chance we've
got to take, right?

10:20.371 --> 10:22.289
Yeah, I see what
you're doing here, bud.
What? Come on.

10:22.373 --> 10:23.707
Let's go.
Guess what?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.792
Reverse psychology
does not work on me.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.045
I'm not using reverse
psychology, man.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.839
I'm just making sure
we're on the same
fucking page here.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.757
Yeah, by trying to use
reverse psychology.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.634
It goes right
off me, Julian.
Bu... Bu...

10:34.718 --> 10:37.346
I would never
fucking use reverse
psychology on you, man.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.473
You're too smart
for that shit.

10:39.557 --> 10:41.141
I'm just making sure that,

10:41.225 --> 10:42.809
you know, if you do
lose Mo forever,

10:42.893 --> 10:44.478
it was our decision
together as a team.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.688
Okay?
Jesus fucking Christ...
All right!

10:46.771 --> 10:48.815
We've got to think about
this maybe one more time!

10:48.899 --> 10:50.359
I'm here for you.
That's all I'm saying.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.278
I'll go in, I'll do
whatever you want.

10:53.362 --> 10:57.241
Fuck's sakes.
We can't go in there!

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
Come on, back to
the fucking truck.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.203
What are we going
to do with my balls?

11:01.286 --> 11:03.038
I've got a plan.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.624
Oh! You've got
a plan. See?

11:05.707 --> 11:07.334
Now it all comes
out in the open.

11:07.418 --> 11:09.253
What?
This is the
plan all along.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.338
You were never planning
on going in there.
What... the fuck?

11:11.422 --> 11:13.965
Are you kidding me?
I was planning on
going in there!

11:14.049 --> 11:16.885
Then you guys started acting
like dicks, so I came up
with a fucking plan!

11:16.968 --> 11:19.513
Just like that,
Julian's fucking plan.

11:19.597 --> 11:21.848
Yeah, well, at least
I've got a fucking plan.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.392
Here, easy man, easy,
easy, easy, easy...

11:23.475 --> 11:25.394
Ah, ah, fuck!
Something just tore!
Oh, Jesus.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.187
Oh, fuck! It feels like
it's wide open again.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.688
I think something's
hanging out.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.815
Oh, my god!
For fuck's sakes, Ricky.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.734
Oh fuck!
All right, we're going
to move on to Plan C.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.613
Get him in there.
Let's go.
Oh, you've got a Plan C too?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.407
Of course I've
got a fucking plan!

11:38.490 --> 11:41.701
Do you have a
fucking plan?
B... Plan B, Plan C.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.704
You've probably got
a fucking D, E and F
and an L, M, N, O, P.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.374
Just get in the
fucking Jeep.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.876
(Dramatic music
on television)

11:53.713 --> 11:56.300
(Sigh)
Ohh...

11:56.383 --> 11:58.802
So, yeah...
Like we were
saying, Marguerite,

11:58.885 --> 12:00.471
um, we've got to take
two parts of the first...

12:00.554 --> 12:02.055
Oh, for Christ's sake,

12:02.139 --> 12:04.308
I already got that
the first time
you explained it,

12:04.391 --> 12:05.892
you noodle-head.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.811
And it's not exactly
fucking rocket science.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.187
Well, it's kind of
like rocket science.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.148
Oh, get out.
Come on, get out.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.484
No! You can't make us...
We can't leave the
guy in the coma,

12:13.567 --> 12:15.819
there's a guy in a coma.
Please, I just want...
Go on, get out.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.029
No!
Get on, get,
the two of you! Get!

12:18.113 --> 12:20.157
Cory:
(Sniffling)

12:20.240 --> 12:22.159
Man, are you okay, dude?
Yeah, man.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.911
It's just the guy in
a coma and everything.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.371
Like, I feel so bad.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.956
I'm pretty sure that
wasn't real, Cory.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.416
Come on, man,
we're killing this!

12:29.500 --> 12:31.001
Only 15 more places to go.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.086
Yeah, man.
Let's do this.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.839
Only 15 more what, guys?
What are you guys up to?

12:35.922 --> 12:37.882
We're not up to
anything, dude.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.010
Oh, come on, you must
have been talking
about something.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.720
I'm just curious.
Not for any reason.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.014
Yeah, right, man.
I know what you're doing.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.141
You're acting all nice
to get information
out of us or shit.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.268
But we ain't doin'
that, 'cause Ricky
would be pissed.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.604
Ricky would be pissed?
What would Ricky
be pissed about?

12:50.688 --> 12:52.523
We can't tell
you that, Randy.
Seriously.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.399
If we told you what
Ricky was going
to be pissed about,

12:54.483 --> 12:56.401
<i>then Julian would be
way madder than Ricky.</i>

12:56.485 --> 12:58.696
Oh, so Julian's
involved too.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.405
What are Ricky and
Julian doing together?

13:00.489 --> 13:04.075
Dude! We told you.
We're not saying shit!

13:04.159 --> 13:05.952
Peace!

13:06.036 --> 13:09.164
You already told
me everything
I needed to know.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.172
What'd we tell him?
Oh, man, I don't know.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.050
Oh, man, well, you don't
know and I don't know,
then he don't know.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.427
Guy's fucked.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.887
Hold still, Ricky,
for fuck's sakes.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.223
This is the extra
strength stuff.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.684
You've got to get it
right in the right spot.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.228
Just hurry the fuck up.
(Grunt)
Jesus Christ!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.438
The fucking thing went
right in his mouth!
Shh-h-h!

13:33.522 --> 13:34.939
It did not, Ricky!

13:35.023 --> 13:36.567
It just got me on the cheek.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.068
I know what a mouth
feels like, Bubs.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.486
(Sobbing)
It didn't go in there.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.405
Just hurry up!
Well, stop shoving me!

13:41.488 --> 13:43.323
This needs to be accurate.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.909
Okay, here, one
dab right there.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.578
Okay, pinch it shut.
Ahh!

13:47.661 --> 13:49.871
You got it?
Yeah.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.583
(Phone rings)
Don't get...
Jesus Christ!

13:52.666 --> 13:55.419
Keep it off your
leg, Ricky.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.922
Hello, Ricky's
NHL ball hockey camp.
Can I help you?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.383
Yeah, starts Monday.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.093
As far as I know,
they're still
fucking coming.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.221
I left them
lots of messages.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.390
You know what? If you
want the fucking spot,
bring your kid money.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.601
If you don't, I don't
give a fuck. Paul's in
your court. Fuck off.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.437
It's "ball", Ricky.
Man:
Holy fuck, that guy's naked...

14:13.520 --> 14:15.606
Who gives a fuck if the
cock-sucking NHL dick-dumbs
fucking show up or not?

14:15.689 --> 14:17.315
Fucking Jesus!
Man 2:
Hey, excuse me, excuse me.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.109
Please keep the swearing
down in the store, folks.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.778
Oh, sorry about that.
Yeah, I can keep it down.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.654
Can you keep the fuck
off and up, though?
Like, way up.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.072
Hey... What the hell
are you guys even doing?

14:24.155 --> 14:25.865
You're opening stuff?
Yeah, I did that.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.284
My friend's trying
to glue my bag shut,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.077
thanks to you fucking
hilli-billy mule whores.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.455
Wha...what?
Who the fuck put this
thing here right now?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.415
I did.
Yeah? Well, maybe next time

14:33.498 --> 14:35.667
you won't want to put
a fucking claw rake
at bag height. See that?

14:35.751 --> 14:37.795
See the fucking
hole right in my nut
chamber right there?

14:37.877 --> 14:40.964
Oh, Jesus! I... Look,
I'm... very sorry...
Yeah, you should be.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.674
Sir, do you want
me to call, like,
an ambulance or...

14:42.758 --> 14:44.968
No, I don't want you to
call a fucking ambulance.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.845
If you call ambulance, you'd
probably get fucking charged,
maybe go bankrupt.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.639
Won't be able to buy my
shit here anymore, okay?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.557
Don't want that to happen.
I'm a nice guy.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.810
So, instead,
maybe I could...

14:52.892 --> 14:55.145
yeah, I could maybe
take one of these
no-cord drills here,

14:55.228 --> 14:57.981
one of these suck-her-up
vacs, paper towlies...
Um...

14:58.064 --> 15:00.191
Pretend like this never
happened. Okay, bud?
Sh... yeah...

15:00.275 --> 15:02.235
You know what? I'll take
one of those for Coolnow.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.488
Coolnow would like that.
(Dog toy squeaking)

15:04.571 --> 15:08.617
Yeah, okay, uh,
I think that is, um...
more than, uh, fair.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.661
You're fucking right it's more
than fair, it's better than
a lawsuit, right?

15:10.744 --> 15:12.621
Yes. So... uh...
It's not your fault.
You were born a little dumb.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.038
It's okay. See you
next time, bud.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.249
Thanks for being
so understanding.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.502
(Chanting)
Ohm-m-m-m...

15:18.585 --> 15:22.088
(Engine whirring,
metallic rattling)

15:22.172 --> 15:25.049
(Chanting loudly)

15:25.133 --> 15:27.761
(Engine gets louder)

15:27.845 --> 15:29.387
(Engine shuts off)

15:31.181 --> 15:32.891
Hey, Barb, can I talk
to you for a minute?

15:32.974 --> 15:34.559
You know what, Randy?
It would be great

15:34.643 --> 15:36.186
if you could get
something a little quieter.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.562
That is so noisy.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.481
Oh, the electric ones
are really expensive,

15:39.564 --> 15:41.525
and this one's more
like a cop car.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.151
I need the practice.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.612
Can I talk to
you about Julian?

15:45.696 --> 15:47.364
What about Julian?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.574
I think you should let him
move back into Sunnyvale.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.117
Absolutely not.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.745
Sunnyvale has been just
fine without Julian.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.914
But he's... he's doing
something with Ricky.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.791
I don't care, Randy.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.084
That is not my problem.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.170
Well, I think it is.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.464
They're going to do
whatever it is that
they're doing anyway.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.216
And if Julian was here,

16:06.299 --> 16:08.844
it would be a lot
easier to make a case
with the cops.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.221
I'm confident I could
take them down, Barb.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.972
I'm training to be
a police officer

16:13.056 --> 16:14.391
and this would
go a long way

16:14.474 --> 16:15.809
to getting me into
the police academy.

16:15.893 --> 16:18.102
<i>No, Randy!</i>

16:18.186 --> 16:20.898
You know, you are beginning
to sound exactly like...

16:20.980 --> 16:23.608
like Jim used to.
And if you're not careful,

16:23.692 --> 16:25.610
Julian will drive
you totally crazy.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.487
(Puffing)

16:27.571 --> 16:29.531
Well, maybe I do sound a
little bit like Mr. Lahey.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.115
But there's one
big difference:

16:31.199 --> 16:32.826
I'm not drunk.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.580
I'm confident
I could do this.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.916
And I could do it while
you're away in Tibet.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.459
Tibet? Oh, for God's sake,
I'm not going to Tibet, Randy.

16:41.543 --> 16:44.588
I'm going to Cape Breton
for a Tibetan retreat.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.256
Well, wherever it is,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.007
let him move in
while you're away

16:48.091 --> 16:50.928
and I promise I'll
take him down for good.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.137
(Sigh)
Fine.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.681
Great!

16:54.765 --> 16:55.933
Thanks, Barb.

16:58.936 --> 17:01.897
(Engine ignition)
(Chanting)
Ohm-m-m-m...

17:01.980 --> 17:04.523
(Loud bang)
(Chanting loudly)

17:04.608 --> 17:06.358
Do, do, do, do.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.278
Hey, I'm Dennis
the Tennis Dog.
(Squeaking)

17:08.361 --> 17:10.405
How are your nuts
feeling, Ricky?
Want me to lick them?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.449
(Squeaking)
Fuck off, Bubs.
That doesn't help.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.452
Oh, come on.
I'll just give your
jungle bridge a lick.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.369
Coolnow's going
to love this thing.
(Squeak)

17:17.454 --> 17:19.163
What's up with
you, man? I thought
you didn't like dogs.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.415
You fucking love him.
Do not.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.627
Do so.
Do not. I'm just saying
he's going to like the toy.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.798
I only got it to distract
him from my kitties.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.549
I don't love him.
(Squeak)

17:31.593 --> 17:33.553
Okay, boys.
You guys ready?
(Gun clicking)

17:33.637 --> 17:35.513
What the fuck have you
got your gun out for?

17:35.597 --> 17:37.098
Because it's Sam Losco.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.976
You guys almost
killed him, remember?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.979
You know he's not going
to agree to do this shit.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.814
(Sigh)

17:43.897 --> 17:45.231
Are we ready?
Yes.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.775
All right, let's go.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.152
Jesus Murphy,
look at this place.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.822
Just take it easy, Ricky.
Hey, buddy, is Sam around?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.073
It's me, Julian.
What?

17:54.157 --> 17:55.700
Sam?

17:55.784 --> 17:57.661
Oh, my fuck, what
happened to your face?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.329
I did a little
work on myself.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.039
I look 20 years
younger, don't I?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.834
No, you look 20
times more fucked.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.670
You look kind of
like a half-chewed
caramel, Sam. No offense.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.338
You guys are just
fucking jealous!

18:08.421 --> 18:10.173
Besides, now,
when I jerk off,

18:10.256 --> 18:11.967
I can actually fucking
suck on my own titties.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.677
Oh, that's... wonderful.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.804
Listen, Sam.
Fucking emergency here.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.181
I got shot in the nuts,
man. You've got to
fucking help me, please.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.851
Nope. I do Botox,
Ricky, not bag-tox.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.269
Sam, I did a bunch of
glue-work to it already,

18:23.353 --> 18:25.856
it would be a
simple stitch job.
I said no.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.525
Every time you
guys come around,
my life goes to shit!

18:28.608 --> 18:30.360
The answer is no!

18:30.443 --> 18:32.195
The answer's yes.
Fuck!

18:32.278 --> 18:33.864
Fix his fucking bag, Sam!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.365
Fuck, calm down, Julian.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.741
Put the fucking gun down.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.368
Come on, Ricky.
Come in the back.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.870
I'll fucking take
a look at it anyway.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.705
Oh, thanks, Sam.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.999
Keep hobbling
there, Ricky.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.084
It's not going to be
that big of a deal,
Sam, I'm telling you.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.003
Like, I did a lot
of the glue-work

18:48.086 --> 18:49.838
and it's all lined up,

18:49.921 --> 18:51.548
so it's really
just some stitches.
(Squeaking)

18:51.631 --> 18:53.758
Drop your drawers
and jump on the gurney here.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.636
Let me take a look.
I'll see what I can do.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.556
Careful,
Ricky, careful.

18:59.639 --> 19:03.393
Yeah, you definitely
shot yourself in the bag.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.938
I haven't seen one
of these in... years.
(Laughing)

19:07.022 --> 19:09.232
I think if I were
to just uhh...

19:09.315 --> 19:11.234
All right, motherfuckers!
Ah fuck!
What are you doing?

19:11.317 --> 19:14.404
Get the fuck out of here
or I'm going to cut
his fucking cock off!

19:14.487 --> 19:15.822
Put down the
fucking knife, Sam!

19:15.906 --> 19:17.741
No! You put down
the fucking gun

19:17.824 --> 19:19.450
or this thing's
coming off, I swear
to fucking God!

19:19.534 --> 19:21.452
Julian...
Ricky: Julian. Put the
gun down, man.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.080
Sam, please, come on.
Don't cut my cock off.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.164
Please, man.
We can work this out.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.333
Listen, I've got actually
a fucking brand new...

19:27.417 --> 19:29.002
uh, one of those
sucker vacs

19:29.086 --> 19:30.795
and a non-corded...
one of the drills.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.463
It's in his fucking
Jeep out there.
You can have them.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.257
Just don't cut
off my cock.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.217
You've got a Jeep now?
What year?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.346
Bubbles:
Careful, Sam.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.681
Ricky:
Careful, Sam. Careful with
that fucking door, man.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.516
Don't let that knife slip.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.351
Sam:
I'm not going to slip.

19:45.435 --> 19:49.106
Okay, okay. All right.
Easy.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.649
Take it easy.
Wow! You must get a lot
of pussy with that rig.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.610
Do you?
Yeah, I actually...

19:53.693 --> 19:55.445
I do pretty fucking good.
Don't like to brag but...

19:55.528 --> 19:56.821
I'm not talking
to you, dumbass!

19:56.905 --> 19:58.448
I'm talking
about the Jeep.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.951
Hand over the keys
there, Lara Croft.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.744
You're not getting
my Jeep, asshole.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.122
Yeah?
(Wincing) Okay, now
he's cutting into the shaft!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.457
Julian, come on, man! We can
get you another Jeep, you
can't get me another cock!

20:07.540 --> 20:09.584
Either the Jeep
is staying or the
cock is staying.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.087
You fucking decide.
Sam, don't do it.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.298
Come on, Julian,
there's no choice
to make here!

20:15.381 --> 20:17.300
(Keys jingling)

20:17.383 --> 20:19.260
All right.
Stitch him up!

20:19.343 --> 20:21.846
You stay out here.
Get the fucking door.
Thanks, Julian.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.474
Fuck...
Okay, release the cock.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.517
Is there any paperwork
with that fucking thing?

20:26.601 --> 20:29.312
No.
Perfect.
(Kiss)

20:29.395 --> 20:32.523
You fucking owe
me one, Ricky!

20:32.607 --> 20:34.275
Fuck's sakes!

20:34.358 --> 20:35.902
It's been a weird day.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.157
Bubbles:
How's the old duffel
bag now, Ricky?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.825
Still pretty fucking sore,
but it's better than it was.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.618
I think he did a
pretty good job.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.662
You think he was
serious when
he said I can't beat off

20:45.745 --> 20:47.664
or have sex for
two weeks, though?
Yes, he was serious.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.373
Think about it.
You could jerk-tear it.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.209
It's not going to be
easy, I tell you that.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.544
You know how fucking
horny I am, boys.
Oh, I know.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.756
What the hell's going
on over there now?

20:56.840 --> 20:59.217
(Laughter)
Bubbles:
Oh, looks like...

20:59.300 --> 21:03.847
people hanging out,
getting along,
acting like a family.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.432
That's what we
should be doing.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.894
Come on, Julian,
just move back to the
park already, please.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.563
Move back. I miss
living with my family too.
Look man, look, look...

21:12.647 --> 21:14.816
I'd probably consider
moving back if it
was even an option

21:14.899 --> 21:18.111
but it's impossible
anyway, so just get it
out of your head, man.

21:18.195 --> 21:20.530
Actually, Julian,
that's not true.
Jesus fuck!

21:20.613 --> 21:23.658
You scared the nuts off me.
Almost literally-ly!
What?

21:23.741 --> 21:27.204
Randy, you just
appear like a fucking
gas now, do you?

21:27.286 --> 21:30.123
What are you talking
about, it's not... true?

21:30.207 --> 21:32.125
Well, out of the
goodness of my own heart

21:32.209 --> 21:34.002
I've pulled some
strings with Barb,

21:34.085 --> 21:36.546
and she said you
could move back in,
if you want to.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.840
Ricky:
Are you serious?
What?

21:38.923 --> 21:41.885
Oh, my God, Julian, you can
move back to the park now!
That's awesome!

21:41.968 --> 21:43.678
(Cackling)
Right on, boys.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.555
Bubs, I've got to take
a drink. Let go of me.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.265
Bubs, let go of me.
I've got to take a drink.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.142
Not lettin' go!
Bubs, please!

21:49.226 --> 21:51.561
Hugging my buddy!
(Cooing)

21:51.644 --> 21:53.146
Ricky:
You going to do it?

21:53.230 --> 21:55.606
I'll think about it.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.942
What do you mean,
you're not going to help
me to take them down?

21:58.026 --> 21:59.443
It's not worth it, Randy.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.945
You're going to lose, bud.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.906
I don't think so,
Mr. Lahey.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.615
I can pretty much guarantee
they're growing dope

22:04.699 --> 22:06.367
or something just as bad.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.994
You have a hunch,
is that what you're saying?

22:08.078 --> 22:10.288
Yeah, a frigging
good hunch.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.916
Randy, do you know
what a hunch is worth

22:12.999 --> 22:14.751
when you're dealing
with people like Ricky

22:14.834 --> 22:16.586
and the Sunnyvale
Police Department?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.963
Jack-shit!

22:19.047 --> 22:21.424
I'm taking them down,
with or without
you, Mr. Lahey.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.260
Randy, I'm telling you,

22:23.342 --> 22:26.137
leave Ricky and
his family alone.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.973
There's a lot more at play
here than you could ever know.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.309
Wow. If I didn't
know any better,

22:31.392 --> 22:34.812
I'd say you had
a crush on Ricky.
(Chuckles)

22:34.896 --> 22:36.773
I don't have a crush
on Ricky, Randy.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.441
Don't be ridiculous.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.693
What is it then?

22:40.777 --> 22:43.362
What is it?

22:43.446 --> 22:48.201
Randy, Ricky...

22:48.285 --> 22:49.660
Ricky and his family

22:49.744 --> 22:51.621
are deserving of
a second chance.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.334
What the frig,
Mr. Lahey?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.797
(Inhaling)
Shot of veggies, Bubs?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.924
Ricky...
(Sighs)

23:03.007 --> 23:05.343
It's not a shot of
veggies. You're still
just smoking dope.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.221
No, but you get all the
nutriments of the veggies
in the fucking smoke.

23:08.305 --> 23:10.807
(Whispering)
Oh my God.
Okay.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.644
So explain to me exactly
what they fucking
told you so I'm sure.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.313
Oh, well, okay.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.439
Well, you're
supposed to mix

23:18.522 --> 23:20.191
two parts of this shit,
Yeah.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.026
with one part of this

23:22.110 --> 23:24.612
and a half-part of this
goddamn stuff, ain't we?

23:24.695 --> 23:26.156
That's right,
isn't it?

23:26.239 --> 23:27.740
That's exactly
right, actually.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.534
Well, boys. I'm
fucking impressed!

23:30.618 --> 23:32.078
Pfft... 'cause
we killed it.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.913
Yeah, man, kicked
ass and killed it.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.665
Fuck man, we totally
kicked ass today.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.416
We explained the whole
process to everybody

23:37.500 --> 23:39.502
and we shut Randy
down when he started
asking us questions.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.338
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

23:41.420 --> 23:44.007
What do you mean,
Randy was asking
you questions?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.508
Well, he just popped
up out of nowhere

23:45.591 --> 23:47.135
and started asking
weird questions.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.095
So, you know, we...
Oh, fuck.

23:49.179 --> 23:50.471
And what did you say?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.767
I don't know.
"I don't know."

23:54.851 --> 23:57.187
Just, well,
I said... stuff.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.148
Stuff...
Stuff, see,
stuff means stuff.

24:00.231 --> 24:02.025
Stuff. Things
were said. Stuff.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.485
What the fuck
did you say, boys?

24:04.568 --> 24:06.821
We just made it really
clear to him that we
couldn't tell him anything

24:06.904 --> 24:10.200
or else Ricky was
going to be pissed.
(Coughing)

24:10.283 --> 24:12.035
You fucking told him I
was going to be pissed?

24:12.118 --> 24:14.371
Yeah!
Well, that was fucking
brilliant, boys!

24:14.453 --> 24:15.913
Oh, thank you, man.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.456
No, he's being
sarcastic, Cory.

24:17.540 --> 24:18.958
What the fuck
is in your brain

24:19.042 --> 24:21.378
you can't pick
up on sarcasm.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.171
This is fucked,
Julian. This is fucked.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.089
Randy's going to know
something's going on now.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.758
Randy already knows
something's going on, man.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.719
Why do you think he let
me back into the park?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.346
Out of the goodness
of his fucking heart?

24:31.429 --> 24:33.597
That...
did seem fishy.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.725
No, he knows
something's up.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.936
And that's why I've
got to move back in.

24:39.020 --> 24:42.399
What? You're moving
back into the park
officially?

24:42.523 --> 24:44.984
It's official?
I'm moving back.

24:45.068 --> 24:46.944
(Giggling)
Right on, boys.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.738
I've got to keep
my eye on him

24:48.821 --> 24:51.115
while he's keeping
his eyes on us.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.284
Oh, I get it.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.536
The old "Keep your
friends close but get
your enemies' toaster".

24:55.619 --> 24:57.914
We've got to get
Randy's fucking toaster.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.666
Ohhh, Ricky...

25:00.750 --> 25:02.085
What?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.254
Did I fuck that up?

25:04.337 --> 25:06.130
Yeah, you
really did, bud.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.424
It's all right.

25:09.175 --> 25:12.470
(Theme music)

25:53.886 --> 25:56.431
(Seabirds squawking)

26:08.734 --> 26:13.156
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

26:13.239 --> 26:15.450
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

26:19.412 --> 26:20.913
<i>(Whisper)
Fuck.</i>

26:20.997 --> 26:22.915
<i>(Light clicks off)
Fuck off.</i>
