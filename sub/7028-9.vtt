00:02.891 --> 00:03.984
I'm a failure.

00:04.019 --> 00:05.429
I've let so many people down.

00:05.464 --> 00:06.518
He's right.
He's wasting our time.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.160
Hey, look at me.

00:09.228 --> 00:10.298
Pull yourself together.

00:10.367 --> 00:11.334
I can't.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.216
It's go time.

00:15.285 --> 00:16.720
Jellybeans up.

00:19.835 --> 00:23.145
- [gasps]
- Yes!

00:23.214 --> 00:25.588
all: Ooh...

00:25.656 --> 00:27.428
Great, that lives there now.

00:27.497 --> 00:28.833
Okay, playtime's over.

00:28.902 --> 00:30.037
Everyone's got work to do.

00:30.106 --> 00:31.643
Oh, Mimi,
acting's not work.

00:31.712 --> 00:32.680
It's a craft.

00:32.749 --> 00:34.319
I swear to God,
Rodrigo,

00:34.389 --> 00:35.826
I'm about to kick
the craft right out of you.

00:35.895 --> 00:37.398
Hey, hey, let's go
to my dressing room,

00:37.468 --> 00:40.134
drink some fizzy water,
not threaten co-workers.

00:40.379 --> 00:41.815
What are you looking at?

00:41.885 --> 00:43.723
Hey, what's going on?

00:43.792 --> 00:46.567
You know Rodrigo's
afraid of you.

00:46.635 --> 00:48.239
Martin's getting
out of prison today.

00:48.308 --> 00:49.711
What?

00:49.780 --> 00:50.882
Your ex-husband's
getting out of prison,

00:50.952 --> 00:51.886
and you didn't even tell us?

00:51.954 --> 00:53.325
I just found out.

00:53.394 --> 00:54.997
He got released early
for good behavior.

00:55.066 --> 00:56.871
What's good behavior
in a white collar prison?

00:56.941 --> 00:58.511
Teach the best Pilates class?

00:58.580 --> 01:01.054
Maybe he Bedazzled
all the license plates.

01:01.122 --> 01:04.498
It's a white collar prison,
but it's still prison.

01:04.568 --> 01:05.805
Fine, he sang a medley
from "Godspell"

01:05.874 --> 01:07.076
and won the talent show.

01:07.144 --> 01:08.715
So what did you
tell your kids?

01:08.783 --> 01:10.221
They're at their grandma's
for the weekend.

01:10.290 --> 01:11.894
But Martin called and said
he was coming to see me.

01:11.963 --> 01:13.432
- When?
- Now!

01:13.502 --> 01:15.407
I haven't seen him
since he got convicted.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.544
He did not take it well.

01:16.614 --> 01:18.386
[gavel pounds]

01:18.453 --> 01:22.198
Mimi! DVR "Grey's Anatomy"
for me, please!

01:22.268 --> 01:24.341
Please!

01:24.410 --> 01:26.181
Martin was always
such a wuss.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.288
He sat at the nerd table
in accounting school.

01:28.357 --> 01:30.162
Just think about that sentence.

01:30.230 --> 01:31.434
Hello, Mimi.

01:33.979 --> 01:36.051
Martin?

01:36.119 --> 01:37.289
The jellybean.

01:51.744 --> 01:55.589
So, Martin, in jail,
did you ever, like,

01:55.658 --> 01:58.100
mouth off to the warden
and get sent to the hole?

01:58.168 --> 02:00.201
- We didn't have a hole.
- Oh.

02:00.270 --> 02:02.337
We had a juice bar.

02:02.406 --> 02:03.872
I'm sorry, can I just--

02:03.941 --> 02:06.909
Martin, I still can't
get over how you look.

02:06.977 --> 02:10.179
Yeah, I cut my hair,
and there wasn't much to do,

02:10.247 --> 02:11.579
so I started working out.

02:11.649 --> 02:14.349
My cellmate was a tattoo artist.

02:14.418 --> 02:16.251
So you got a tattoo
of "Weird Al" Yankovic?

02:17.855 --> 02:20.355
That's Mimi.

02:20.424 --> 02:22.791
I had a lot of time
to think the past few years.

02:22.860 --> 02:24.760
And I just want a chance
to show you

02:24.829 --> 02:26.962
that things can be different.

02:27.031 --> 02:29.531
We can be a family again.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.433
Uh, Mimi, they need us on set,

02:31.502 --> 02:32.868
immediately, right now,

02:32.937 --> 02:34.703
right now, for the scene, Gael,

02:34.772 --> 02:37.740
- for that scene with the puppy--
- Murder.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.075
The puppy murder.

02:40.144 --> 02:41.910
Don't worry, Martin,
the puppy does the murdering.

02:41.979 --> 02:42.878
Yeah, it's so cute.

02:42.948 --> 02:43.880
Sounds cute.

02:43.949 --> 02:44.881
Yeah, yeah.

02:44.950 --> 02:45.981
Good to see you, Martin.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.250
Love the look, very prison-y.

02:47.319 --> 02:49.319
Wow, did you see Martin?

02:49.386 --> 02:50.887
He looked good.

02:50.956 --> 02:52.287
- Didn't he look good?
- He looked good.

02:52.356 --> 02:53.889
You wrong.
He looked great.

02:53.958 --> 02:55.358
And he never used to
talk about us

02:55.427 --> 02:56.926
and the family before.

02:56.995 --> 02:58.027
What do I do?

02:58.096 --> 02:59.429
Nothing.

02:59.498 --> 03:00.996
No matter how good he looked,
don't forget,

03:01.065 --> 03:02.831
Martin is still the same guy
who stole lots of money

03:02.901 --> 03:04.100
from his clients
and lied to you.

03:04.169 --> 03:05.735
That hasn't changed.

03:05.804 --> 03:07.069
Okay, but in his defense,
did you see his tush?

03:07.138 --> 03:08.871
Ha, ha!
Hold on.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.639
What am I saying?
I don't want him back.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.374
At least, I don't think so.

03:12.444 --> 03:14.177
Mimi, you're unhinged.
You're all over the place.

03:14.246 --> 03:15.311
You're talking crazy.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.913
[gasps]
You sound like me.

03:16.982 --> 03:18.047
- [gasps]
- That's not good?

03:18.116 --> 03:19.249
No, it's not.

03:19.317 --> 03:20.517
You know what you need?

03:20.585 --> 03:22.352
Someone to ground you,
to calm you.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.154
You need a Mimi.

03:24.222 --> 03:26.623
You need me to be your Mimi.

03:26.691 --> 03:28.658
You need a Me-Mimi.

03:28.727 --> 03:30.861
You need a Mini-Me-Mimi.
That is me.

03:30.929 --> 03:31.828
- Mi-mi-mi-mi--
- Please stop.

03:31.897 --> 03:33.229
Yep.
Kay, come on.

03:33.299 --> 03:34.797
<i>Let's go.</i>

03:34.866 --> 03:37.635
All right, Mimi,
what are we gonna do?

03:37.703 --> 03:39.002
You know what?

03:39.070 --> 03:40.504
We're gonna get your mind
off Martin

03:40.573 --> 03:42.672
by having a good old-fashioned
girls night out.

03:42.741 --> 03:44.340
Oh, I love girls night out.

03:44.409 --> 03:46.042
Should we invite the guys?

03:46.111 --> 03:47.944
Fine, I'll attend
your silly bonding ritual.

03:48.013 --> 03:50.014
But no hugs,
no hair-braiding,

03:50.082 --> 03:51.148
and no, "you go, girls."

03:51.216 --> 03:52.816
I make no promises.

03:52.885 --> 03:55.853
Oh, Gael, it really is
just the girls.

03:55.922 --> 03:58.122
Sushi, margaritas,
some light purse talk.

03:58.191 --> 03:59.490
But I love all those things.

03:59.559 --> 04:01.258
Dude, come out with me
and Rodrigo tonight.

04:01.327 --> 04:02.526
This will be fun.

04:02.595 --> 04:03.994
You never really
bro it out with us.

04:04.063 --> 04:06.063
What is involved
in bro-ing out?

04:06.132 --> 04:08.132
Eating steaks,
watching sports,

04:08.201 --> 04:09.833
having sex with women.

04:09.902 --> 04:12.102
Okay, I like most
of those things.

04:12.171 --> 04:13.804
Good, you go out
with the boys and have fun.

04:13.873 --> 04:15.372
We'll just end up
talking all night.

04:15.441 --> 04:17.708
It's gonna be so boring.

04:17.777 --> 04:20.543
Ha, ha!

04:20.613 --> 04:21.545
[all groaning]

04:21.613 --> 04:23.480
Oh, that's awful!

04:23.549 --> 04:24.549
Let's do another one.

04:24.618 --> 04:25.950
What are those shots called?

04:26.018 --> 04:27.451
Brain bombs.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.386
Mimi made me do them
when I broke up with Xavi.

04:29.455 --> 04:32.223
And since I'm Mimi's Mimi,
I'm making her do them.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.125
Circle of life.

04:34.194 --> 04:35.793
Still can't believe
Martin went to prison

04:35.862 --> 04:37.361
a soft, scared, little man
and came back

04:37.430 --> 04:38.963
looking like a hot thug.

04:39.031 --> 04:40.432
Oh, my God,
I'm a cholo chaser.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.499
- Was he really that boring?
- Oh, hell yes.

04:42.568 --> 04:44.636
He'd make us listen to NPR
during sex.

04:44.705 --> 04:46.471
He'd also wear
compression socks to bed

04:46.540 --> 04:48.473
and would drink a glass
of whole milk at every meal.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.242
Whole milk,
come on, brah.

04:50.310 --> 04:51.977
Shh!
Enough Martin talk.

04:52.045 --> 04:53.645
Kay, before we go out,

04:53.714 --> 04:56.681
I want to make a toast
to beautiful, talented,

04:56.750 --> 04:58.850
independent women
who don't need men

04:58.919 --> 05:00.318
to lead full lives.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.987
I will not toast to that.

05:02.055 --> 05:04.389
I would be nothing
without my husband, Ed.

05:04.459 --> 05:06.858
- Wait, you're married?
- Weird, right?

05:06.927 --> 05:08.493
None of us have ever
met the guy.

05:08.562 --> 05:10.495
Yeah, I don't think he can
come out during the day.

05:10.565 --> 05:12.365
He might burst into flames.

05:12.433 --> 05:13.798
Do not make fun
of my husband.

05:13.867 --> 05:15.567
We're equal partners.

05:15.636 --> 05:18.003
When we walk on the beach,
we leave one set of footprints.

05:18.071 --> 05:21.073
Ed knows me,
every nook and cranny.

05:21.142 --> 05:22.074
[laughter]

05:22.143 --> 05:23.709
both: Ew.

05:23.778 --> 05:25.076
Isaac, the place looks great.

05:25.145 --> 05:26.312
Where'd you get that couch?

05:26.381 --> 05:27.913
I got it from the stage
next door,

05:27.982 --> 05:30.382
Mario Lopez's talk show,
"Hablo con Mario."

05:30.450 --> 05:31.883
Why did they cancel that?

05:31.952 --> 05:33.685
I guess no one wanted
to hablo con Mario.

05:33.754 --> 05:35.187
Hey, guys.

05:35.256 --> 05:37.823
Gael, you ready to hang out
with the bros, brah?

05:37.892 --> 05:39.190
I don't think so.

05:39.260 --> 05:40.792
I was reading an article
about the show,

05:40.861 --> 05:42.328
and I started looking
at the comments.

05:42.397 --> 05:45.130
Oh, papito,
never read the comments.

05:45.198 --> 05:47.266
This one guy said I was
the worst actor on the show,

05:47.335 --> 05:49.402
and that my eyebrows were ridic.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.103
Short for ridiculous--
clever.

05:51.172 --> 05:52.672
But forget about all of that.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.873
Let's go out
and have some fun.

05:53.941 --> 05:54.874
But what if he's right?

05:54.942 --> 05:56.676
I want to talk about this.

05:56.744 --> 05:58.611
I tried calling Ana and Mimi,
but they don't answer.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.012
Yeah, that's right.

06:00.082 --> 06:03.215
I want to order 12 large
meat lover pizzas

06:03.284 --> 06:05.885
delivered to Gustavo--

06:05.953 --> 06:08.889
[whispers] Wait, what's
Gustavo's last name?

06:08.957 --> 06:10.156
I don't know.

06:10.224 --> 06:11.391
- [laughter]
- I don't know!

06:11.460 --> 06:13.226
Well, we're here.

06:13.295 --> 06:14.660
We can talk about it.

06:14.729 --> 06:16.395
- You would do that for me?
- Of course.

06:16.464 --> 06:18.598
We get harsh things
written about us all the time.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.434
A girl once said I wear
too much man jewelry.

06:21.502 --> 06:23.202
I already took ten things off.

06:23.271 --> 06:26.373
Someone once wrote I look like
a hot Mr. Potato Head,

06:26.442 --> 06:28.842
which, I can't lie, is kind of
what I'm going for.

06:28.911 --> 06:30.477
Oh, yeah.

06:30.546 --> 06:31.645
Great talk.

06:31.714 --> 06:34.081
Guys night out!
Whoo-hoo!

06:34.149 --> 06:35.749
Actually,
if you don't mind,

06:35.818 --> 06:38.184
I'd like to talk
a little bit more.

06:38.252 --> 06:41.221
[laughter]

06:41.290 --> 06:42.823
Oh, you're serious.

06:42.891 --> 06:44.891
Sure, we can talk about it
a little bit,

06:44.960 --> 06:45.892
and then we'll head out.

06:45.961 --> 06:49.730
Great, thanks, guys.

06:49.798 --> 06:51.631
I'm so confused.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.266
Was becoming an actor
a huge mistake?

06:53.335 --> 06:54.668
I mean, I could've
been anything--

06:54.737 --> 06:57.170
a model, a supermodel,
a fitness model,

06:57.239 --> 07:00.574
fashion model, ab model,
underwears model,

07:00.642 --> 07:02.641
shoes-- I can sell
a lot of shoes.

07:07.143 --> 07:09.708
Ah!

07:09.777 --> 07:10.775
[groans]

07:10.843 --> 07:14.274
I'm so hungover.

07:14.343 --> 07:16.543
Roxie, what did we do
last night?

07:16.612 --> 07:17.977
I don't remember.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.545
All I know is I woke up
on your kitchen counter,

07:19.614 --> 07:20.947
got dressed, and ran
to the gym.

07:21.015 --> 07:22.548
How are you not hungover?

07:22.617 --> 07:23.982
Oh, I'm very young.

07:24.051 --> 07:25.650
Oh, yeah.

07:25.719 --> 07:27.219
Oh, God, I'm going down.

07:27.287 --> 07:28.320
I'm going down.

07:28.389 --> 07:29.820
Roxie, catch me!

07:29.889 --> 07:31.222
[grunts]

07:31.290 --> 07:32.289
Did you catch me?

07:32.358 --> 07:34.959
I wanted to.

07:35.027 --> 07:36.761
- Hey.
- Mimi!

07:36.828 --> 07:38.927
Do you remember anything
we did last night?

07:38.996 --> 07:41.397
No.

07:41.465 --> 07:44.232
Good morning.

07:44.301 --> 07:45.789
Okay, I remember
one thing I did.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.511
[hiccups]

07:55.591 --> 07:58.829
So, Martin, I'm so glad
Mimi met you last night.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.003
You know, she doesn't date much
since her loser husband

08:01.072 --> 08:03.415
went to jail.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.462
Who I just figured out is you?

08:06.532 --> 08:08.940
Yes, Roxie, this is Mimi's
sex-husband--

08:09.010 --> 08:11.217
ex, ex, I meant.

08:11.286 --> 08:12.691
Ex, not sex.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.800
I should probably go.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.375
I'll give you a call
later, Mimi.

08:16.443 --> 08:19.289
Feels like we have
so much more to talk about now.

08:19.357 --> 08:20.292
Really missed you.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.790
Well, Martin,
it was such a surprise

08:26.858 --> 08:29.703
to see you this morning.

08:29.771 --> 08:31.377
Oh, have a great day.

08:31.447 --> 08:32.717
Catch you later.
Bye-bye.

08:32.785 --> 08:34.191
Okay.

08:34.260 --> 08:36.635
Oh, my God, Mimi,
you had sex with Martin,

08:36.703 --> 08:37.908
and in my bed?

08:37.977 --> 08:39.616
Also your steam shower.

08:39.684 --> 08:40.888
I don't have a steam shower.

08:40.957 --> 08:42.195
- Damn, Mimi.
- I know, right?

08:42.264 --> 08:43.735
What happened?

08:43.804 --> 08:45.310
I don't know.
I don't remember anything.

08:45.378 --> 08:46.715
How did he get here?

08:46.784 --> 08:48.491
Check your phone.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.099
Right there.

08:50.168 --> 08:52.811
Uh, okay, at 3:45 AM,
I texted Martin,

08:52.879 --> 08:54.083
"Are you up?"

08:54.151 --> 08:55.958
He texted back,
"Yep, what you doing?"

08:56.027 --> 08:58.705
And then I texted,
"You in 30 minutes."

08:58.774 --> 09:02.389
Hey-o!
Bow-chicka-wow-wow, wow-wow.

09:02.457 --> 09:03.761
I'm definitely still drunk.

09:03.830 --> 09:05.436
The moment we started
drinking,

09:05.505 --> 09:07.043
I knew I should've locked
your phone in my safe

09:07.112 --> 09:10.124
with my passport
and my zombie apocalypse money.

09:10.194 --> 09:12.601
When it happens,
I'm gonna buy my way to safety.

09:12.671 --> 09:16.084
But as your Mimi, Mimi, I got to
shut this Martin thing down.

09:16.154 --> 09:18.731
You were miserable when
you were married to him.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.739
You always said he was
selfish and boring.

09:20.809 --> 09:23.051
I know, but it's like he's
a completely different person.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.428
Between last night and all this
talk about our family,

09:25.497 --> 09:28.275
maybe he's becoming the man
I've always wanted him to be.

09:28.345 --> 09:30.552
You are in no condition
to make a big decision

09:30.621 --> 09:31.825
like that right now.

09:31.895 --> 09:33.398
Look, I want you to stay
away from Martin

09:33.467 --> 09:34.972
until we can figure
this out together.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.647
All right, you're right,
I'll stay away.

09:36.716 --> 09:38.221
Hey, does anyone else
have extra jewelry

09:38.291 --> 09:39.695
from last night?

09:39.764 --> 09:41.504
Somehow I ended up
with four skull rings.

09:41.573 --> 09:44.416
Yeah, I ended up
with this ugly heart bracelet.

09:44.485 --> 09:45.890
I gave you that
last Christmas.

09:45.959 --> 09:46.928
Thank you.

09:46.997 --> 09:49.004
It is so pretty.

09:54.062 --> 09:55.902
[all gasp]

09:55.971 --> 09:59.218
I had that same nightmare
where I was bald.

09:59.286 --> 10:00.625
What?

10:00.694 --> 10:01.964
It's a choice.
I shave this.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.438
What time is it?

10:03.507 --> 10:04.979
Did we spend the whole night
talking about

10:05.048 --> 10:06.251
what Gael could do
instead of being an actor?

10:06.319 --> 10:07.456
Last thing I remember,
I was Googling

10:07.525 --> 10:08.929
how to become a foot model.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.275
Turns out I don't
have the arches for it.

10:11.343 --> 10:12.412
Well, at least you feel
better.

10:12.482 --> 10:13.719
Not really.

10:13.788 --> 10:15.125
I just hate that those
Internet trolls

10:15.194 --> 10:17.067
got into my head.

10:17.137 --> 10:18.876
It's not fair that some guys out
there can say anything they want

10:18.945 --> 10:19.881
and get away with it.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.187
You know what, enough talking.

10:21.256 --> 10:22.660
Let's take action, boys.

10:22.729 --> 10:24.503
Talking is not doing.
Doing is doing.

10:24.571 --> 10:25.909
Oh, I like that saying.

10:25.979 --> 10:27.651
Put that on a fitted t-shirt.
I would wear it.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.127
Let's find one of these guys
and confront 'em.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.635
Okay.

10:31.703 --> 10:33.410
Well, this one's from Sweden.

10:33.479 --> 10:36.792
Sweden, Sweden-- wow, Swedish
people do not like you.

10:36.861 --> 10:38.433
Oh, here's one from Miami.

10:38.535 --> 10:40.946
It says he works at
Kool Kona Coffee on Ocean Drive.

10:41.014 --> 10:43.591
Let's see how much he has to say
when he says it to your face.

10:43.659 --> 10:45.667
See you soon,
@TheRealBigBadBrad.

10:45.736 --> 10:47.208
That's his name?

10:47.277 --> 10:50.321
Can't we just confront
@UnicornKisses23?

10:50.392 --> 10:51.828
Gael, we're doing this.

10:51.897 --> 10:52.901
Who's hungry?

10:52.969 --> 10:54.274
Where'd you get that food?

10:54.342 --> 10:55.278
From the new cooking show
next door,

10:55.347 --> 10:57.120
"Cocina con Mario."

10:57.188 --> 11:00.067
They're really trying to get
something going con Mario.

11:00.136 --> 11:03.081
Okay, guys, I made us
some greasy bacon sandwiches.

11:03.150 --> 11:04.922
- Where's the bread?
- The bacon's bread.

11:04.991 --> 11:06.663
- So what goes in the middle?
- Also bacon.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.472
It's just a pile of bacon.
Eat it.

11:11.890 --> 11:13.463
- [camera shutter clicks]
- What are you doing?

11:13.531 --> 11:15.573
Uh, taking pictures
of my breasts for my doctor.

11:15.641 --> 11:16.845
It's a new mammogram app...

11:16.914 --> 11:18.887
i...
iBoob.

11:18.956 --> 11:21.935
iBoob?
Really?

11:22.004 --> 11:23.040
I knew it.

11:23.108 --> 11:25.352
You're sending these to Martin.

11:25.421 --> 11:26.489
Sidebar, they look amazing.

11:26.558 --> 11:27.561
We got to talk bras later.

11:27.630 --> 11:28.834
I know.
I'm sorry.

11:28.903 --> 11:30.240
It's just, it's kind of fun.

11:30.309 --> 11:31.345
We've never flirted
like this before.

11:31.414 --> 11:32.819
Mimi, this is going too fast.

11:32.887 --> 11:34.460
I want you to stop contact
with Martin.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.838
Fine, you're right, Mimi.

11:36.906 --> 11:37.842
<i>[phone chimes]</i>

11:37.910 --> 11:39.483
It's not my phone.

11:39.551 --> 11:41.358
Oh, I think it's coming
from Isabela's purse.

11:41.427 --> 11:42.530
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.037
I thought she went home.

11:44.106 --> 11:45.778
She has a bunch of missed
calls from her husband.

11:45.847 --> 11:47.486
What?

11:47.555 --> 11:50.166
Oh, no, he just texted,
"Where are you? I'm worried."

11:50.234 --> 11:52.074
Oh, my God,
Isabela's missing.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.955
We got to find her.
She's our friend.

11:55.025 --> 11:56.797
Okay, she's someone
we work with.

11:56.866 --> 11:57.801
Where else did we go
last night?

11:57.870 --> 11:59.342
Come on, ladies, think.

11:59.411 --> 12:01.787
I think I kissed a very
petite man with a ponytail.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.427
- That was me.
- Ah.

12:05.305 --> 12:07.713
Oh, now I know what we did.

12:07.782 --> 12:09.087
all: Mannequin jousting.

12:09.155 --> 12:12.771
<i>♪ keep shaking it ♪</i>

12:12.840 --> 12:14.378
<i>♪ keep shaking it ♪</i>

12:14.447 --> 12:16.019
Okay, two things
I remember now.

12:16.088 --> 12:18.698
One, I'm the champion
of mannequin jousting.

12:18.767 --> 12:21.044
Two, Isabela was still
with us on set.

12:21.112 --> 12:22.685
But where did we go next?

12:22.753 --> 12:24.223
Must be a clue somewhere.

12:26.637 --> 12:28.242
I don't just stick things
in my hair.

12:28.311 --> 12:30.687
I know, but sometimes I do.

12:30.756 --> 12:33.200
"Blaze Deluxe."

12:33.268 --> 12:35.642
Well, ladies, either we hired
a stripper last night, or--

12:35.712 --> 12:37.050
Yeah, we hired a stripper.

12:37.119 --> 12:38.088
There's nothing else
he can be.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.428
We need to go see him.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.901
Maybe he knows something
about Isabela.

12:40.971 --> 12:42.609
He's the CEO of

12:42.677 --> 12:45.791
"Global Superstar Entertainment
International."

12:45.859 --> 12:47.733
Oh, I hope we can
get an appointment.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.052
No deal, brah,
bubble machine is extra.

12:52.121 --> 12:55.434
Listen, I got to jet.
My next appointment's here.

12:55.504 --> 12:56.842
Sorry about that.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.449
So go.

12:58.518 --> 13:00.693
This is your office,
Mr. Deluxe?

13:00.762 --> 13:02.468
Well, this is my
East Coast office.

13:02.537 --> 13:05.213
Everything West Coast
is handled in my Honda Civic.

13:05.282 --> 13:07.021
Look, I can help you
find your friend,

13:07.091 --> 13:10.640
but it's gonna cost you
$1,000.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.045
We'll give you 10 bucks.

13:12.115 --> 13:13.150
I would've done it for two.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.438
You just got blazed.

13:14.508 --> 13:15.658
[imitates gunshots]

13:18.406 --> 13:19.455
[grunts]

13:23.679 --> 13:25.612
Yeah, you guys
hired me last night.

13:26.224 --> 13:27.261
And then things got cray.

13:27.338 --> 13:28.337
What happened?

13:28.415 --> 13:29.881
Well, for starters,

13:29.949 --> 13:31.617
that little spider monkey
climbed on my back

13:31.685 --> 13:33.653
and tried to bite me.

13:33.722 --> 13:35.422
I do do that.

13:35.491 --> 13:36.590
And the big-haired cougar
you were with

13:36.659 --> 13:37.925
tipped me with a check.

13:37.995 --> 13:39.294
all: Isabela.

13:39.363 --> 13:40.763
So tell us more
about the cougar.

13:40.832 --> 13:43.834
Some baller with a sweet suit
came by with roses.

13:43.903 --> 13:45.202
She left with him.

13:45.271 --> 13:46.805
Maybe it was her husband.

13:46.872 --> 13:48.707
Why would he still be
looking for her this morning?

13:48.776 --> 13:50.277
You don't think Isabela's
having an affair, do you?

13:50.345 --> 13:51.710
[gasps]

13:51.778 --> 13:53.280
A-choo!

13:53.348 --> 13:55.651
Yeah, she's having an affair.

13:55.719 --> 13:57.919
Do any of you fine ladies
know how to fold a fitted sheet?

13:57.988 --> 13:59.756
- Oh, just--
- Don't touch that.

14:05.066 --> 14:07.099
That must be Brad.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.233
He looks like a Brad.

14:08.302 --> 14:09.435
What does a Brad look like?

14:09.504 --> 14:10.938
Like a Mitchell,
but nerdier.

14:11.007 --> 14:12.406
Gael, we're all gonna
go up there

14:12.475 --> 14:13.975
and tell Brad that if he has
something to say,

14:14.044 --> 14:17.380
he can say it to your face.

14:17.449 --> 14:18.483
It's Brad.

14:20.253 --> 14:21.351
Man, that guy's big.

14:21.421 --> 14:22.987
It's okay;
we can take him.

14:23.056 --> 14:24.456
Have either of you ever
been in a fight before?

14:24.525 --> 14:25.492
- Yes.
- All the time.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.594
Any that weren't on TV?

14:26.662 --> 14:27.595
- Never.
- Nope.

14:27.663 --> 14:30.532
Hey.

14:30.601 --> 14:33.102
Gael Garnica?

14:33.171 --> 14:34.135
Yes?

14:37.810 --> 14:40.012
I can't believe
it's actually you!

14:40.081 --> 14:41.780
I am such a huge fan of yours.

14:41.849 --> 14:44.818
But you said I was
the worst actor on the show.

14:44.888 --> 14:45.919
Oh, that.

14:45.988 --> 14:47.789
I was having a really bad day.

14:47.858 --> 14:49.892
Plus, I hate that talking doll
storyline you guys are doing.

14:49.960 --> 14:50.892
You hate it?

14:50.961 --> 14:52.128
The doll has more lines than me

14:52.197 --> 14:53.130
and more love scenes.

14:53.199 --> 14:54.798
It is a very sexy doll.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.601
The point is, Brad,
you can't write mean stuff

14:56.670 --> 14:58.004
like that online.

14:58.072 --> 14:59.505
It's hard not to take
personally.

14:59.574 --> 15:01.274
I've been upset ever since
I read it.

15:01.342 --> 15:03.143
Yeah, how would you feel
if we wrote online

15:03.212 --> 15:04.679
that your coffee sucks?

15:04.748 --> 15:06.949
Well, I guess I'd have
the self-confidence

15:07.018 --> 15:08.817
to know that it doesn't matter
what a bunch of strangers think

15:08.886 --> 15:10.387
as long as I'm okay.

15:10.454 --> 15:11.956
Oh.

15:12.025 --> 15:13.558
That's another way to handle it.

15:15.896 --> 15:17.497
So Isabela's cheating
on her husband.

15:17.566 --> 15:19.233
At least she's alive.

15:19.302 --> 15:21.569
Yeah, I would hate to be
responsible for her death.

15:21.637 --> 15:23.138
I mean, if I got caught.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.175
Martin!

15:26.244 --> 15:27.743
Hi, Ana.

15:27.812 --> 15:29.180
Hey, beautiful.

15:29.249 --> 15:30.481
Hey!

15:30.550 --> 15:32.651
Sorry, it's a reflex.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.652
What is he doing here?

15:33.721 --> 15:35.153
I know, what are the odds?

15:35.221 --> 15:36.790
Mimi, you said you would
stop texting him.

15:36.858 --> 15:38.124
Fine, he just needed to know
where we were

15:38.193 --> 15:39.226
to come pick up my house keys.

15:39.295 --> 15:40.394
He's staying with you?

15:40.464 --> 15:41.797
He has no place else to go.

15:41.865 --> 15:43.666
- Mimi!
- He just got out of prison.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.103
That was gonna be
my argument.

15:46.172 --> 15:47.471
Forget the fact that
he's a criminal.

15:47.540 --> 15:49.773
He was a bad husband
before that.

15:49.842 --> 15:52.244
Remember?
Selfish and boring.

15:52.313 --> 15:54.114
Okay, but, do you see
how sweet he's being?

15:54.183 --> 15:56.016
I mean, he's even taking me
to Il Palazzo for dinner.

15:56.086 --> 15:57.518
I have always wanted
to go there.

15:57.587 --> 15:59.355
Yeah, 'cause he never
took you out.

15:59.423 --> 16:01.056
He never did anything for you.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.759
When you guys got married,
he made you register

16:02.827 --> 16:04.061
at Office Depot.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.963
We got matching his and her
staplers.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.298
Okay, it's complicated.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.801
Martin and I
had a life together.

16:08.870 --> 16:10.837
We had a family.
I want that back.

16:12.307 --> 16:14.876
You already have that.
You don't need him.

16:14.945 --> 16:16.044
Give me that.
Give me!

16:16.114 --> 16:17.046
Give me the keys.

16:21.588 --> 16:22.953
Roxie!

16:23.024 --> 16:25.024
I didn't know whose team
I was on.

16:25.092 --> 16:27.360
Give me those keys, Martin.

16:27.429 --> 16:30.131
Oh, yeah?

16:30.199 --> 16:33.368
Are you seriously
climbing me?

16:33.438 --> 16:34.369
Give me it!

16:34.438 --> 16:36.739
Give me that!
Give me that!

16:36.808 --> 16:38.275
- Mimi!
- Martin, let's go.

16:40.814 --> 16:43.215
As your Mimi,
I can't let you go with him.

16:43.284 --> 16:44.985
I don't need a Mimi.
You're fired.

16:45.054 --> 16:47.253
I don't care.
I'm not letting you go.

16:47.321 --> 16:49.090
Ha!
Ha, ha, ha!

16:52.462 --> 16:54.570
Damn it!
I hate reverse!

16:57.716 --> 17:00.842
<i>[knocking on door]</i>

17:00.844 --> 17:03.224
I hear you.

17:03.226 --> 17:05.861
For the love of God,
please stop knocking.

17:09.267 --> 17:11.902
Isabela and...

17:11.904 --> 17:13.236
family?

17:13.238 --> 17:14.305
So weird.

17:14.307 --> 17:16.608
Uh, where have you been?

17:16.609 --> 17:20.346
I mean, besides here,
where you've been all night?

17:20.348 --> 17:24.986
Not jousting or with strippers
or leaving with strange men.

17:24.988 --> 17:26.820
Hi, I'm Ana.

17:26.823 --> 17:28.491
Words are not my friend
right now.

17:28.492 --> 17:30.793
India, Carson, this is what
happens when you

17:30.795 --> 17:32.263
make poor life choices.

17:32.265 --> 17:34.931
She'll probably be homeless
in a year.

17:34.933 --> 17:36.301
Is my purse here?

17:36.303 --> 17:37.870
I hope I didn't leave it
in the Uber.

17:37.872 --> 17:39.873
That was an Uber driver
that took you home?

17:39.875 --> 17:41.340
Why did he have flowers?

17:41.342 --> 17:42.777
Blame that one on me.

17:42.779 --> 17:46.313
Yesterday was our
14 1/2 year anniversary.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.818
We celebrate everything.
This man is my king.

17:51.390 --> 17:53.157
Hey, what about the text
Ed sent this morning

17:53.159 --> 17:54.825
saying he was worried about you?

17:54.827 --> 17:56.794
Oh, we got separated
at the farmers' market.

17:56.796 --> 17:59.231
I got sucked in by
the fresh preserves.

17:59.233 --> 18:00.534
What can I say?

18:00.536 --> 18:02.002
Jam is my jam!

18:02.004 --> 18:04.671
[laughter]

18:04.673 --> 18:05.874
What's happening?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.876
Okay, Boozie, we're leaving.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.912
We go out to dinner
every Saturday night.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.480
Every Saturday night?

18:11.482 --> 18:14.350
We also send each other
handwritten love poems.

18:14.352 --> 18:15.519
Would you like to hear one?

18:15.521 --> 18:16.988
100% no.

18:16.990 --> 18:19.826
But that does give me an idea.

18:19.828 --> 18:22.895
How about I take you guys out
for dinner tonight?

18:22.897 --> 18:25.566
Fine, but she can't
sit with us.

18:25.568 --> 18:26.868
Wouldn't want to.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.604
Why don't we go
to Il Palazzo?

18:28.606 --> 18:29.939
Oh, we love it!

18:29.941 --> 18:32.175
Isabela and I spent
the fifth anniversary

18:32.177 --> 18:33.877
of our third date there.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.248
Ed, you are riding
my last nerve right now, buddy.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.083
This trip was a waste
of time, huh?

18:39.085 --> 18:40.520
Not at all.

18:40.522 --> 18:42.187
If you guys didn't get me
to come down here,

18:42.189 --> 18:43.790
I would've just stayed at home
and stewed over it.

18:43.792 --> 18:47.529
But I faced @TheRealBigBadBrad,
and now I feel way better.

18:47.531 --> 18:50.465
So do you need to
talk about it some more?

18:50.467 --> 18:52.134
No, I'm good.

18:52.136 --> 18:53.937
But I do want to talk
about last night,

18:53.939 --> 18:55.406
when Ana kissed Roxie.

18:55.408 --> 18:57.541
Is it weird that I
found it arousing?

18:57.543 --> 18:58.675
both: No.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.074

19:11.595 --> 19:12.796
What are you doing here?

19:12.798 --> 19:14.063
I know you fired me
as your Mimi,

19:14.065 --> 19:15.633
but I'm here as Ana.

19:15.635 --> 19:18.302
And Ana has decided, instead of
fighting her hangover,

19:18.304 --> 19:22.341
she's gonna lean way into it.

19:22.343 --> 19:25.379
[slurping]

19:30.254 --> 19:31.754
[exhales]

19:31.756 --> 19:34.592
Now I feel way worse.

19:34.594 --> 19:36.026
So did you come here
to see how things

19:36.028 --> 19:37.461
turned out between
Martin and me?

19:37.463 --> 19:39.798
I came here to show you that.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.833
<i>So weird.</i>

19:41.835 --> 19:43.535
Isabela wasn't lying.

19:43.537 --> 19:44.972
She has the perfect family.

19:44.974 --> 19:46.607
They even go to
farmers' markets.

19:46.609 --> 19:48.174
They probably ride
their bikes there.

19:48.176 --> 19:49.544
Just to rub it in our faces.

19:49.546 --> 19:51.446
- [laughter]
- Oh!

19:51.448 --> 19:54.450
Ugh, look, Mimi,
I just want you to be happy.

19:54.452 --> 19:56.387
And if that demon woman
can have the perfect family,

19:56.389 --> 19:57.788
so should you.

19:57.791 --> 19:59.457
If you think Martin can give
that to you,

19:59.459 --> 20:00.792
then I'll support you.

20:00.794 --> 20:01.827
Hmm.

20:04.299 --> 20:05.699
He ordered without me.

20:05.701 --> 20:07.168
He knows I hate that.

20:10.641 --> 20:11.640
Ugh.

20:11.642 --> 20:12.742
What am I doing?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.510
He's never gonna change.

20:14.512 --> 20:16.212
He's always gonna be boring
and selfish

20:16.214 --> 20:17.748
and drink that stupid milk.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.350
Milk is stupid.
Nobody drinks it.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.354
I can't make the same
mistake twice.

20:21.356 --> 20:23.489
Mimi, you're gonna be
fine without Martin.

20:23.491 --> 20:25.993
I think I was just
holding on to the idea of him

20:25.995 --> 20:28.330
and not actually him.

20:28.332 --> 20:30.999
I just wanted someone
for after the kids go to bed,

20:31.001 --> 20:34.036
a warm body to cuddle up with
and watch TV.

20:37.043 --> 20:38.776
See, Mimi, you don't need
a husband to do this.

20:38.778 --> 20:40.211
- You got me.
- Yep.

20:40.213 --> 20:42.114
You and everyone else.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.016
Hey, somebody's feet
are freezing.

20:44.018 --> 20:45.418
Sorry.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.887
Mimi, I can't believe
you almost

20:46.889 --> 20:48.188
got back together
with your ex-husband.

20:48.190 --> 20:50.624
They did more than that.
They had sex.

20:50.626 --> 20:51.626
Huh?

20:51.628 --> 20:53.261
In this very bed.

20:53.263 --> 20:55.364
[all yelling]

20:55.366 --> 20:56.466
Mimi!

20:56.468 --> 20:57.802
We also did it on the floor.

20:57.804 --> 20:59.904
[all yelling]

20:59.906 --> 21:01.739
And the bathroom's
not safe either!

21:01.741 --> 21:03.641
[all whimpering]
