WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.400
That one's yours.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.900
Sorry, 30 waffles is my limit.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.900
And that's something I really didn't
wanna know about myself.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.900
Let me guess.
A tribute to Belgium?

00:16.200 --> 00:18.600
We're trying to win
the great waffle sweepstakes.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.400
Inside one of these specially marked
boxes of waffles

00:21.700 --> 00:23.600
is a genuine, solid-gold waffle.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.400
Some parts of Canada
not eligible.

00:25.700 --> 00:29.700
Oh, good.
I thought you were just wasting time.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.299
When you're finished with the toaster,
would you send this

00:32.500 --> 00:33.600
to the Other Realm for me?

00:33.700 --> 00:36.600
Oh, man. You got called for
witches' council duty?

00:36.800 --> 00:38.700
Yeah, and I have to send in
a postponement letter.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.200
I'm just too busy with my chemistry.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.200
I don't have to do
witches' duty anymore.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.600
And that's just one of
the perks of being a felon.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.700
Please don't forget to send it.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.400
- What do we look like to you, morons?
- Get the camera.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.000
- I promise. I'll send it.
- Thanks.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.600
Oh, by the way,

00:58.900 --> 01:00.800
did you happen to think
that the solid-gold waffle

01:01.100 --> 01:02.500
might be in the heavy box?

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.700 --> 01:23.000
Why don't you come up
and see me sometime?

01:23.200 --> 01:26.000
But call first.

01:31.100 --> 01:34.400
Look at him, Sabrina.
Kirk. Isn't he beautiful?

01:34.600 --> 01:36.500
And it's all on the outside,
where it matters.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.900
Hey. You're on the football team
with Kirk.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.600
Tell me everything about him.

01:40.800 --> 01:47.300
- Think he gets athlete's foot a lot.
- Carry me over, sweet Jehovah.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.300
You okay? You seem kind of down.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.200
I just found out that Joseph Stalin
was a bad guy.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.300
Yeah, the whole school's
taking it really hard.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.200
No. It means I flunked
my European History exam.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.000
Didn't have time to study
now that coach

02:00.300 --> 02:02.200
added an extra hour
to football practise.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.300
If you talked to him,
he'd let you out early.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.900
I did talk to him.

02:06.100 --> 02:09.400
Coach said, "Anybody can read,
but you can't teach speed."

02:09.800 --> 02:11.300
Ridiculous.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.300
But I guess that makes
sense coming from a guy

02:13.500 --> 02:15.700
who wears a weight belt
to lunch.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.600
What you writing?

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
An editorial for school

02:19.100 --> 02:20.900
about how too much emphasis
is placed on sports

02:21.200 --> 02:23.200
and not enough on
intellectual achievements.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.100
- Seriously, what are you writing?
- Hey.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.900
- Careful. Tree in the kitchen.
- Thanks.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.800
Must have spilled some bark extract

02:33.100 --> 02:35.000
when I was making a spell
for that guy I dated.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.800
- Randy?
- Yeah.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.200
I hope it made him a better listener.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.000
Hilda!

02:45.300 --> 02:47.700
You forgot to mail
my postponement letter.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.300
I have witches' council duty
starting tomorrow.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.300
Can't believe this.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.700
I was this close to
finding a cure for acne,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.300
and now there's no hope
for the oily.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.200
Why don't you just take the notice

03:00.400 --> 03:02.400
and throw it away
and say you never got it?

03:02.700 --> 03:05.600
- I've heard witches do it all the time.
- Because it's wrong.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.100
And I don't wanna set
a bad example for Sabrina.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.200
Don't worry. Watching you throw away
a letter

03:10.400 --> 03:12.700
is not gonna make me
knock over a liquor store.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.400
I mean, I definitely will serve.
I want to serve.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.400
- It's just that now is not a good time.
- Attagirl.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.100
Why couldn't I have been
an only child?

03:29.500 --> 03:30.900
What's going on here?

03:31.200 --> 03:33.100
Don't bother looking
for your editorial.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
I took it out.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.700
It was totally offensive
to cheerleaders.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.600
You can't do that.
Valerie's the editor.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.500
Wrong. I am.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.400
Why is Libby saying
she's the editor?

03:45.700 --> 03:47.500
Because I kind of let her
be editor for a week

03:47.600 --> 03:49.700
in exchange for
introducing me to Kirk.

03:49.900 --> 03:52.700
That makes sense. They do that
all the time at the <i>Washington Post.</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:54.600
I know it was a stupid idea,

03:54.800 --> 03:57.800
but I really think this is the guy
I'm supposed to marry.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.000
- Well, did you at least meet him?
- Not exactly.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.900
Libby pushed his face into the
fountain, then blamed me for it.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.500
He seemed more wet than smitten.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.800
The printer's on my way home.
I could take that if you want.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.100
Gee, thanks.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.300
Much better.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.100
Sabrina.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.400
- I really liked your editorial.
- Thanks. You were my inspiration.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.600
I know.
I just hope coach doesn't find out.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.700
Oh, well. Blocking-sled drill isn't so bad
once you go numb.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.600
There you are.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.000
Hi, Libby. Thanks for putting
my editorial in the paper.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.700
I didn't. You must have.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.600
And you also must have doctored
this ridiculous photo of me.

04:55.300 --> 04:59.100
- I don't even like pie!
- Everybody likes pie.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.600
How can you win a pie-eating contest
if you don't like pie?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.500
Sabrina, you have to write a retraction
to your editorial.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.900
What? But it's an opinion.
You can't retract an opinion.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.400
Oh, you can, and you will.

05:13.700 --> 05:16.300
The biggest donations to this school
come from high school sports,

05:16.600 --> 05:20.100
and I will not let that go away
because of some teenage Gandhi.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.300
I think it would be wrong
for me to do that.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.300
Look, I am in charge here.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.400
And in order to maintain a free press,
you will write whatever I tell you to.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.000
I was sticking up for my boyfriend.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.800
He failed an exam because the coach
wouldn't let him study.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.500
- Your boyfriend's name is Harvey?
- No.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.300
Excuse me, I'm choking.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.200
Sabrina causing trouble again?

05:42.500 --> 05:44.700
Oh, I have seen her type
a million times.

05:44.900 --> 05:48.300
- The individual.
- Keep your eye on her, Mr. Kraft.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.300
There's something weird
about that girl.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.000
You're a good American, Libby.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.300
You best take cover.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.400
Me and this tree here
have some business to tend to.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.200
Shouldn't we call a professional?
Just a suggestion.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.500
Doorbell.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.400
Mr. Kraft, what are you
doing at my house?

06:17.500 --> 06:20.400
Well, surprise is
a vice principal's only friend.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.600
Hello. May I help you?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.100
Well, I certainly hope so.
I'm Willard Kraft.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.300
I'm the vice principal
of Westbridge High.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.800
Loser.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.100
I'm Sabrina's aunt.
Is there some sort of problem?

06:32.500 --> 06:34.900
Well, Sabrina has written
a very offensive editorial,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.800
and I think it best that
she write a retraction to it.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.200
But it's an opinion.
You can't retract an opinion.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.400
That's what she said. I mean,
what is this place, some kind of cult?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.800
And what is going on
in there?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.900
We just have
a really loud icemaker.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.000
Hi. I was just...

07:09.300 --> 07:13.600
"The holy city which is your face,
your little cheeks the streets of smiles."

07:14.000 --> 07:15.300
E.E. Cummings.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.900
- Who are you?
- Willard Kraft, vice principal.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.300
Hilda Spellman. Not interested.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.300
You know, I've never
seen anything like this before.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.900
- It's called a tree.
- Right.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.200
I'm glad our niece is being taught
by someone so worldly.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.900
You know, once you get this out
of here, the floor's gonna be a mess.

07:33.300 --> 07:39.100
I'd be happy to give you some tips
on refinishing, you know, over coffee.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.400
- Or maybe dinner and dancing?
- No.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.800
I know my mother says
I'm too dramatic,

07:55.100 --> 07:56.400
but this time I'm serious.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.200
If I don't talk to Kirk soon, I will not
be able to take in another breath.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.000
Don't you quit on me, Val!

08:04.700 --> 08:07.400
Oh, come on,
it was a little funny.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.000
There's gotta be something
in here that could help Val.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.200
Perfect. Cupid.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.400
<i>Love is beautiful, love is alive</i>
<i>Send me Cupid for just $5.95</i>

08:29.300 --> 08:31.800
You're Cupid?
You don't look like Cupid.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.100
Gee, never heard that one before.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.500
I want you to make him
attracted to her.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.500
$5.95.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.600
Let's see here.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.100
- Hey, you just touched my butt.
- I didn't, I swear.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.200
Yes, you did.
You just touched my butt.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.000
If he's gonna fall in love with him,
I want my money back.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.900
Wait. Just wait.

09:04.800 --> 09:10.700
- Hi. What's your name?
- I...

09:11.000 --> 09:13.500
I can't remember.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.700
You'll never guess who
just asked me out. Kirk.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.800
- Should I still guess?
- I'm so excited, I can't eat.

09:22.100 --> 09:26.000
I can't even sit down.
I think I'm gonna throw up.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.800
Hey. What's wrong?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.800
Coach was a little hard on me
in practise yesterday.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.100
He didn't like your editorial
very much.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.600
Oh, no. He found out
I was your girlfriend?

09:39.500 --> 09:40.800
And I bet I know how.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.700
- Maybe I should just write a retraction.
- No.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.200
It would be wrong for you
to write something you don't believe in.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.200
No matter how it affects
my spine.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.100
Sabrina.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.000
Here's your next assignment
for the paper.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.100
Mr. Kraft says you're not allowed
to write editorials anymore.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.300
I have to write an article
on lunch menus?

10:02.500 --> 10:05.800
No, you just have to transcribe
the menus.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.000
Can you handle that?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.800
Sabrina.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't even like pie!

10:19.300 --> 10:21.600
You filled Libby's locker
with pies, didn't you?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.300
Libby's locker? Pies? Me?

10:24.600 --> 10:28.600
You. And I think this warrants
a little time in detention.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.700
- Oh, but that's not fair.
- Oh, Sabrina.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.500
And that would really
upset my aunt Hilda,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.300
who likes you so very much.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.900
Really? Why, I didn't
get that impression.

10:38.600 --> 10:43.600
- She's just shy. Doesn't get out much.
- Interesting. Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.500
That business about the detention?

10:45.700 --> 10:48.400
Now, that does not
have to happen this year.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.600
All right. Thanks, Mr. Kraft.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.400
Still catnip to the ladies.

10:56.900 --> 11:03.300
Please? Please? Please?
Please go out with Mr. Kraft!

11:03.800 --> 11:06.700
No. He's a goofball.
Now leave me alone.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.700
- He's nice to me when you like him.
- When have I ever liked him?

11:10.300 --> 11:13.100
Well, you did, kind of, today.
But to change the subject,

11:13.400 --> 11:16.400
- I think he's suspicious of my magic.
- Then don't do magic at school.

11:16.700 --> 11:20.000
Now, if you don't mind, I'm reading a
very important George Clooney article.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.700
- Please! Please, please!
- No!

11:26.100 --> 11:27.300
- Please?
- No!

11:28.500 --> 11:31.600
- Come on.
- No.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.700
Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please!

11:35.900 --> 11:37.800
Never!

11:38.100 --> 11:39.800
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.500
Phone.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.500
- Hello.
- Hi, may I speak with Hilda, please?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.600
One moment, please.
Salem, what am I gonna do?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.500
It's Mr. Kraft calling for Aunt Hilda.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.200
Start speaking in Spanish
and hang up.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.100
- Hello.
- Hi, Hilda.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.200
This is Willard Kraft.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.100
I was wondering if you'd like
to have dinner on Saturday night.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.500
Why, I'd love to, Willard.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.700
That was amazing. Now do Nixon.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.600
<i>Love is beautiful</i>
<i>It's never corrupt</i>

12:17.800 --> 12:20.600
<i>Send me the $6 Cupid</i>
<i>Unless the rates have gone up</i>

12:24.000 --> 12:25.300
I chafe.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.800
Look, I need you to make my aunt

12:27.000 --> 12:28.900
temporarily attracted
to my vice principal.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.700
No problem. First, of course,

12:30.900 --> 12:33.300
I'm going to need your aunt
to sign a release form.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.900
I didn't have to do that last time.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.500
That's because we were dealing
with a minor. Minors don't sue.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.900
Oh, I should say rarely.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.400
But doesn't a release form

12:40.600 --> 12:42.500
sort of eliminate
the element of surprise?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.600
Yes, I'm sorry,
but people never used to sue.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.300
Now the slightest
little thing and:

12:46.500 --> 12:50.100
I got the nice diaper on
and I'm standing in front of a judge.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.100
Sorry, then I guess
I just can't do it.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.700
Well, if you change
your mind, here's my card.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.100
I also do catering.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.000
Salem, what am I gonna do?

12:59.300 --> 13:01.200
I have to get Aunt Hilda out
on that date tonight.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.000
I could go instead of Hilda.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.600
You know me.
Any excuse to wear taffeta.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.400
There's gotta be something in here.
What's this?

13:09.700 --> 13:12.100
"How to make your friend
act like a dummy. Great for parties."

13:12.300 --> 13:14.600
Oh, I know that spell.
The Charlie McCarthy.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.900
They still have their motor skills,
but you have to talk for them.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.100
That's perfect. I'll sneak along
on the date and talk for Aunt Hilda.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.600
Will you distract Zelda
while I put the spell on Hilda?

13:23.800 --> 13:28.100
Hey, is a dog dumber than a hammer?
That's a yes.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.600
I've been meaning
to talk to her anyway.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
What is it, Salem?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.800
I don't wanna be late
for the witches' council.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.300
Now that you're on
the witches' council,

13:37.600 --> 13:40.600
I thought I'd show you
a different side of Salem.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.500
I can't get your sentence reduced.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.700
No longer the world-domination
Salem of the past,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.600
but a more charitable Salem.
Shirt-off-your-back Salem.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.400
That's kind of his nickname
down at the shelter.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.800
Salem, how do you know
Mother Teresa?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.900
Fundraiser.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.200
- Bye, Sabrina.
- Wait. Where are you going?

14:04.500 --> 14:06.400
- The gym.
- But you can't!

14:06.600 --> 14:09.200
I mean, you don't need to go
to the gym. With that body?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.100
I don't go for my body.
I go to flirt with that cute juice boy.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.300
- Wait! Aunt Hilda!
- What?

14:17.200 --> 14:19.600
- It's so awful.
- What's so awful?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.600
Being a teenager!

14:26.500 --> 14:30.300
You and Albert Schweitzer.
You and Desmond Tutu.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.800
Salem, these are obviously
doctored photos.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.300
It hurts me that you would...

14:35.600 --> 14:38.900
I can't keep it up.
I don't know those guys.

14:39.300 --> 14:46.200
They wouldn't return my calls.
I just don't wanna be a cat anymore.

14:46.700 --> 14:50.000
Oh, don't cry. Your fur will mat.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.900
Okay. I'll put in a good word
at the witches' council for you.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.100
- You will?
- Sure.

14:59.700 --> 15:03.900
What's this?
You and Shari Lewis?

15:04.300 --> 15:07.400
That's actually from
my personal collection.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.500
There, there.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.400
<i>Be a dummy, be a fool, switch off</i>
<i>Your brain, so please don't drool</i>

15:21.600 --> 15:23.800
Let me give this a try.
My name is Hilda.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.100
Let me give this a try.
My name is Hilda.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.600
- Cool.
- Cool.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.600
- Hilda, you look beautiful tonight.
- Thanks.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.700
- You look totally hot.
- Really?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
- These are for you.
- Thanks. Let's go.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.800
Okay.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.300
You were awfully quiet
in the car.

16:00.900 --> 16:05.000
- Hi. I mean, what a great place.
- Yeah, it's my favourite.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.200
- There's a booth.
- Cool.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.700
What'll it be?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.900
Sweetie, you're gonna
have to order something.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.100
I'll have iced tea
and the cowboy special.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.100
- From Indiana, and my father...

16:22.400 --> 16:24.900
I'll have an iced tea
and a cowboy special.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.900
Fine. Well, the waitress
should be here shortly.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.900
The special? That's a lot of meat.
Comes with four kinds of beans.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm real hungry.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.500
- My father was a bricklayer, so...
- Yeah, yeah. I'm real hungry.

16:35.700 --> 16:39.200
Okay. Miss?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.700
So I haven't spoken
to my ex-wife

16:42.000 --> 16:43.500
or my brother since.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.600
You know, this is my first real date
since the divorce.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.100
Although the free time
has been good for me now.

16:50.300 --> 16:56.300
I've been able to spend some
real quality time with my grandma.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.400
I told you that I'm living with her,
didn't I?

16:59.600 --> 17:01.700
Yeah, you grossed me out
with that earlier.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.800
Enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.200
Not much to tell. I play the violin.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.000
I want you to stop being mean
to Sabrina.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.400
I haven't been mean
to Sabrina.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.300
<i>Have so. You've been mean</i>
<i>to Harvey too.</i>

17:13.599 --> 17:15.200
Have so. You've been mean
to Harvey too.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.700
Now, I don't know what
she's been telling you...

17:18.000 --> 17:19.599
Just promise to quit it.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.700
I promise.

17:24.300 --> 17:28.800
Kind of pushy, aren't you?
I think I like that.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.300
Sabrina! I'm so glad you're here!
What are you doing here?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.100
Look, you can tell me later.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.900
I'm on my date with Kirk,
and I can't go through with it.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.600
- You're here with Kirk?
- I don't know a Kirk.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.600
I peaked.
I was so excited about my date

17:43.800 --> 17:46.200
that I got ready too early.
About six hours too early.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.800
Now my hair and my makeup,
it's all going downhill.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.100
- You have not peaked.
- You have not peaked.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.700
Really? You mean that?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.600
- Yeah, you look totally beautiful.
- Your hair looks great.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.800
And that is a totally cool outfit.

17:59.100 --> 18:02.000
Really? You don't think it makes me
look a little too hippy?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.500
- Thanks, I needed that.
- Oh, come here.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.800
- What's on my face, an eyelash?
- Yeah, come here.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.100
- How's this?
- No, closer.

18:10.700 --> 18:15.500
- You are feisty, and I like that.
- Make a wish.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.500
Okey-dokey.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.400
Too much garlic?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.300
Oh, no.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.700
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
Save your breath.
Come on, young lady.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.200
You taking me to the
witches' council?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.900
No, I'm taking you
to your Aunt Zelda.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.800
She's much better
at punishing than me.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.800
Oh, Sabrina, how could you
put a spell on Hilda?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.500
I think when you threw away
that juror letter,

18:58.800 --> 19:00.900
it did have a bad effect on me.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.300
I'm sorry. It was incredibly stupid.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.400
Hey, can my punishment be
that I had to eat 2 pounds of steak?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.600
Witches' council resumes
in ten minutes.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.100
You know, putting a spell
on a guardian is very dangerous.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.500
It leaves us unable to protect you.
What if there was an emergency?

19:15.700 --> 19:17.900
Why are you wearing
that awful dress?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.200
You don't understand. It was the only
way I could save Harvey from Kraft.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.800
Oh, so you were doing this
to save Harvey?

19:24.100 --> 19:25.300
- Right.
- Is that the only person

19:25.500 --> 19:26.600
you were trying to save?

19:26.900 --> 19:30.200
- Yes.
- So it was a totally selfless act?

19:30.500 --> 19:33.300
- Okay.
- Let's see if you're telling the truth.

19:35.900 --> 19:40.400
Sabrina, if you're telling the truth,
you'll be able to stay inside the circle.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Looking good.
I'm staying in the circle.

19:44.300 --> 19:46.600
But that's not all.
You have to stay inside the circle

19:46.900 --> 19:49.300
while wrestling your conscience.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.300
- That's my conscience?
- Apparently.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.400
Okay, I may have been trying to
save myself just a little.

20:03.700 --> 20:07.400
Hey! I confessed!
Wait! I'm not in the circle!

20:07.800 --> 20:10.700
Why can't my conscience
speak English?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.900
So how'd your date go with Kirk?
Do I get to be maid of honour?

20:14.100 --> 20:16.600
Not yet. I mean, Kirk's really cute,
and he's totally popular,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.300
which, by association, would make me
slightly more popular,

20:19.600 --> 20:21.800
but he only talked about engines.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.000
Could it be I'm not so shallow
after all?

20:25.500 --> 20:27.400
- Let's hope it's just a phase.
- Let's.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.400
There is something very, very strange
about you and your entire family,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.800
and I'm going to keep my eye
on you.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.800
Sabrina. You wanna go to the Slicery
after school today?

20:40.000 --> 20:44.500
I'd love to, but I can't. I'm grounded.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.200
Don't move.
I got a perfect shot at an oriole.

20:48.600 --> 20:53.000
- I hope you've learned your lesson.
- If I say I have, will you dig me up?

20:53.600 --> 20:57.500
- It's raining. We should go in.
- I am out of here.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.300
What about me?

21:01.200 --> 21:05.000
Thanks. Exactly what I need.
A lightning rod.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.700
I'm sorry. You can't pay me
in anchovies.

21:11.900 --> 21:15.400
- And you won't take a cheque.
- Look, I have to be honest with you.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.100
It's more than that.
It's against my principles.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.500
Is it because I'm a cat
and she's a woman?

21:20.800 --> 21:23.300
No, it's because you're a cat
and she's Shari Lewis.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.300
I can make her so happy.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.600
Besides, she's gotta be tired
of that whiny lamb.

21:28.900 --> 21:33.500
- Not even a lamb. It's a sock.
- You sicken me.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.700
Get a real job. And some pants.
