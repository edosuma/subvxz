I've been with Suzanne for - what?
20 years or something now.

01:32.410 --> 01:35.109
I don't feel like
I have to get married.

01:35.110 --> 01:39.910
Everything about is a false,
made up, over-the-top day.

01:40.050 --> 01:44.550
I blame films - "Oh, the princess
is getting married" and all that.

01:44.710 --> 01:48.570
They never did a Cinderella sequel.
How was it after the shoe fit?

01:48.650 --> 01:51.749
Did they get on? I don't know.

01:51.750 --> 01:55.609

I'm meeting a bloke called Gopal,

who's job it is
to get people together.

02:32.970 --> 02:34.969
It's like online dating,

02:34.970 --> 02:37.029
but the mums and dads get together

02:37.030 --> 02:41.209
and they have a bit of a say
on whether it's the person for you.

02:41.210 --> 02:44.730
I don't know who me mum and dad
would pick. Me mum likes anyone.

02:44.890 --> 02:48.410
She tends to feel sorry
for people who look a bit odd -

02:48.490 --> 02:50.610
that's what she liked about Elvis.

02:50.790 --> 02:53.530
Whenever Elvis was on stage,
sweating,

02:53.690 --> 02:57.669
he'd get a towel off someone
who was a bit ugly, a fat lump.

02:57.670 --> 03:00.410
He'd never go for
the nice-looking woman

03:00.550 --> 03:02.809
and that's what she'd do with me -

03:02.810 --> 03:05.849
"No-one else would want this person,
you go out with her."

03:05.850 --> 03:07.930
She's too nice for her own good.

03:08.090 --> 03:11.129
Whereas me dad,
he'd end up picking someone

03:11.130 --> 03:14.490
who's dad runs the butcher's or
something so he can get free meat.

03:21.050 --> 03:22.790
Here we are.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.390
A To Z.

03:40.730 --> 03:42.390
OK, then.

03:42.530 --> 03:45.049
Date of birth - 1972.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.770
Height - I'm about six foot.

03:48.550 --> 03:52.869
Blood type... Surely you don't
pick people on your blood type.

03:52.870 --> 03:55.590
Being bald,
I think that should be on here -

03:55.770 --> 03:59.930
loads of women don't want
a bald bloke. I'm hairy.

04:00.070 --> 04:04.229
I've got hairy ears,
hairy chest, hair on me back.

04:04.230 --> 04:08.709
But none on me head. Some women
would be like "Definitely not."

04:08.710 --> 04:12.730
But there's not a space for that.
They're asking me blood type.

04:12.870 --> 04:15.930
I've never heard that - "It wasn't
working." "Why?" "Odd blood."

04:19.930 --> 04:23.590
Is that good? There wasn't a part
about the bald head and hairy.

04:28.410 --> 04:30.969
If she was bald, I'd want to know.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.469
Right, so this is the bit
where I write down

04:34.470 --> 04:36.890
what I want out of the woman.

04:36.950 --> 04:39.290
So, education. Erm...

04:42.650 --> 04:45.050
She's quite intelligent.
Yeah.

04:45.110 --> 04:49.350
It's not exam results I want,
I just want common sense in a woman.

04:49.510 --> 04:52.090
Technical qualification.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.390
I'll put electrical, that's
quite handy. I haven't got a clue.

04:58.650 --> 05:02.650
She wouldn't want me, I don't think.
I don't think she would like me.

05:02.790 --> 05:06.170
I don't want her
being into celeb life,

05:06.250 --> 05:08.729
reading Heat magazine and all that.

05:08.730 --> 05:11.929
I don't want her wasting her time
on that sort of shit.

05:11.930 --> 05:14.469
She can have magazines,
but not that sort.

05:14.470 --> 05:16.710
What's her hair like?

05:17.910 --> 05:19.990
Why's she got a cap on?

05:20.623 --> 05:22.523
She'd never get anything done.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.290
That's the same woman
without the cap?

05:29.030 --> 05:31.030
Better with the cap.

05:40.630 --> 05:44.150
How much jewellery?
Does she wear a lot of jewellery?

05:44.310 --> 05:47.670
No, no. She's not fond of jewellery.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.450
Does Suzanne not have rings?

05:49.590 --> 05:52.649
No, I don't buy her much jewellery.
It annoys me.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.869
She had a mate who had loads

05:54.870 --> 05:58.570
and the more I heard it, the more I
couldn't focus on what I was doing.

05:58.730 --> 06:02.249
It was like knocking about
with a wind chime. I don't like it.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.790
Can I just see her head again?

06:04.970 --> 06:07.850
It's good.
Do you think she'd like me?

06:13.730 --> 06:16.130
I never wear a suit.

06:17.290 --> 06:19.050
Really?

06:32.750 --> 06:34.870
Afternoon. You all right?

06:35.530 --> 06:38.090
Just after a suit.

06:38.170 --> 06:40.490
How's business? Busy?

06:41.430 --> 06:43.369
This popular style?

06:43.370 --> 06:46.370
It is very popular.
I'm on a date tonight.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.810
Ohh.
Yeah.

06:51.190 --> 06:54.569
You can get this colour if you want.
The design is the same.

06:54.570 --> 06:56.970
Colour is different.

06:57.130 --> 07:00.630
Hey, that looks good with
the T-shirt. Nice with the T-shirt.

07:00.790 --> 07:03.530
She's going to be well happy
with this.

07:03.610 --> 07:05.550
'It's just a date.'

07:05.570 --> 07:09.410
At least, this way, meet
the family, there's no secrets.

07:09.610 --> 07:14.569
I don't know how that would've
affected... I'm with Suzanne.

07:14.570 --> 07:18.869
If I'd've met her mam straightaway,
I might've gone "Forget it."

07:18.870 --> 07:22.250
Who knows? Sometimes
you can just put two people together

07:22.330 --> 07:24.329
and they get on.

07:24.330 --> 07:27.030
Look at Heston Blumenthal,
that chef.

07:27.190 --> 07:30.870
He puts weird shit together.
Vienetta with Yorkshire pudding.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.770
"It shouldn't work."
"I know, but it's nice."

07:44.230 --> 07:46.250
Have you?

07:46.310 --> 07:48.330
All good?

07:56.950 --> 07:58.890
Fairly good.

08:00.650 --> 08:02.730
Yeah.

08:03.690 --> 08:05.750
Are they doctors?
No, no doctors.

08:05.910 --> 08:07.650
They've retired now.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.770
Me dad has done loads of jobs,

08:09.910 --> 08:12.329
from tiling, gardening,

08:12.330 --> 08:15.669
he's done courier work, taxi driver,

08:15.670 --> 08:18.090
he had a butty shop...

08:24.710 --> 08:26.709
I didn't do that well.

08:26.710 --> 08:30.570
The school wasn't very good
that I went to.

08:33.610 --> 08:38.249
If I'm honest, I wasn't interested
in a lot of what they were teaching.

08:38.250 --> 08:42.250
I just wanted to get school done
and get a job.

08:42.409 --> 08:45.609
I used to do a bit of robbing
when I was younger.

08:45.610 --> 08:50.230
Nothing big. But, you know,
toffees, chocolate...

08:53.510 --> 08:56.809
Erm, I'd like to be picked

08:56.810 --> 09:02.070
on whether she thinks I'm the man
who could look after her...

09:05.430 --> 09:08.490
I know, but I don't think
that should matter.

09:08.570 --> 09:11.530
I could say I'm earning thousands,

09:11.670 --> 09:15.530
but I might not tell you
I'm a gambler and I lose it all.

09:16.330 --> 09:19.990
There's a lot of nutters out there
who are earning fortunes,

09:20.070 --> 09:22.230
but they're idiots.

09:23.670 --> 09:25.610
I don't owe any money.

09:25.670 --> 09:28.969
She won't starve.
She's got a roof over her head.

09:28.970 --> 09:32.490
We know somebody
who was very interested in her.

09:32.550 --> 09:35.849
Though she was 34, 35...

09:35.850 --> 09:38.090
Are you looking for somebody...

09:38.250 --> 09:41.929
Who's domesticated or would you like
your would-be wife...

09:41.930 --> 09:45.270
What do you do now for living?
For job?

09:45.450 --> 09:48.809
It's all about how you look.
How it looks.

09:48.810 --> 09:51.530
You are intellectual.
You write book.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.910
I've got a house.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.390
Full house. Five bedrooms.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.230
Yeah, well...

10:09.450 --> 10:11.690
Well, maybe in time.

10:23.830 --> 10:27.310
I really would like
to meet you again. All right.

10:35.370 --> 10:38.710
We always have lavish, big wedding.
Right.

10:57.290 --> 11:01.270
That went well.
It went too well, really.

11:01.370 --> 11:05.609
That is proper mental.
An hour 15 minutes

11:05.610 --> 11:08.809
and I could meet the person
I'll spend the rest of my life with.

11:08.810 --> 11:12.629
I've sat in doctor's waiting rooms
with someone longer than that

11:12.630 --> 11:16.610
and I don't even know their name.
Here, I'm getting married to them.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.529
I would like to study,

11:19.530 --> 11:22.470
so is it OK?
You'd be fine with that?

11:22.730 --> 11:25.770
Would that be evenings or daytime?

11:25.930 --> 11:29.450
I think she would be all right
and I know I'd be all right,

11:29.610 --> 11:32.009
so it would last.

11:32.010 --> 11:34.530
She still liked me for what I was,

11:34.690 --> 11:38.250
there was no chat-up lines,
no trying hard,

11:38.310 --> 11:40.649
it was just being meself.

11:40.650 --> 11:44.650
I like cake.
You have a sweet tooth? Yeah.

11:44.810 --> 11:48.170
Me too. I love chocolate cake...
I love chocolate cakes...

11:48.250 --> 11:52.129
Maybe you should learn baking.
Together, that'd be nice.

11:52.130 --> 11:55.690
Eat yourself and bake him some.
Yeah, that should be good.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.850
I forgot - I've got Suzanne at home,
she doesn't know what's going on.

11:58.940 --> 12:02.479
Last time I spoke to her, there was
a problem with the boiler again!

12:02.480 --> 12:06.160
She's no idea I'm talking about
getting married to some woman

12:06.240 --> 12:07.900
who I met an hour ago!

12:16.160 --> 12:17.660
Right.

12:19.408 --> 12:22.608
It was good to know that,
if everything did go tits up,

12:22.688 --> 12:25.308
someone would put up with me.

12:25.488 --> 12:28.188
I don't know she looked at me
as "the one",

12:28.348 --> 12:30.127
you couldn't find "the one" here,

12:30.128 --> 12:33.807
where the population's
over a billion people.

12:33.808 --> 12:37.048
You have trouble finding
a parking space, it's that busy,

12:37.127 --> 12:38.867
so you couldn't find "the one".

12:42.337 --> 12:46.077
I was just thinking about it last
night, it was going over me head.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.479
Shivani Pilkington.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.699
Could imagine getting post
through the door.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.780
Shivani...

12:55.460 --> 12:57.620
Shouting her name round the house.

12:59.220 --> 13:02.400
What would happen if, like,
I did meet her again?

13:02.408 --> 13:04.968
I'm not because we're busy,

13:05.128 --> 13:07.047
but say I did meet her again

13:07.048 --> 13:10.228
and I said
"It's not working, is it?"

13:10.408 --> 13:14.628
Would it be wrong to say "If
your sister's still available..."?

13:29.608 --> 13:31.848
Like, last night with Shivani,

13:32.008 --> 13:34.708
she was up for marrying me
day after tomorrow, wasn't she?

13:34.728 --> 13:37.768
So what they do here,
because people meet like that,

13:37.928 --> 13:41.448
they meet really quickly
and they don't know each other,

13:41.588 --> 13:45.587
so they end up paying a detective
to follow people,

13:45.588 --> 13:48.488
to find out if the story
they've been giving them is true.

13:54.337 --> 13:55.993
I'm Karl. How are you?

13:58.840 --> 14:01.080
So, what's the plan?

14:12.651 --> 14:16.491
Yeah. He's not a smoker,
he's a non-drinker, vegetarian...

14:29.409 --> 14:32.729
Are you married?
Marriage is a kind of bond in India.

14:32.777 --> 14:37.417
If you are married, you are bound
to each other, you share everything

14:37.597 --> 14:40.957
and if you are hiding something,
you are not right to your partner.

14:41.097 --> 14:44.157
Well, I met a woman last night...
OK.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.337
To see if... we could get married.

14:47.417 --> 14:50.556
I went to a marriage broker,

14:50.557 --> 14:52.636
looked at some profiles,

14:52.637 --> 14:55.356
picked a woman,

14:55.357 --> 14:57.757
went and met her dad and her mum,

14:57.837 --> 15:00.157
had some biscuits... OK.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.537
She, er... She loved me.

15:02.717 --> 15:04.796
No!
Yeah, she did.

15:04.797 --> 15:09.177
She wanted a date today, but I said
"I can't, I'm out on a job."

15:09.237 --> 15:12.157
Yeah, it was mad.
She was really keen.

15:12.317 --> 15:16.456
Really keen.
Keen to get married with you. Yeah!

15:16.457 --> 15:18.397
Yeah...

15:19.497 --> 15:21.597
We are in the position.

15:21.657 --> 15:23.677
We're in position? Yeah.

15:23.837 --> 15:26.557
Do you know if
he's wearing this T-shirt?

15:26.697 --> 15:29.377
That's not him, is it,
with the striped jumper?

15:29.397 --> 15:31.837
See the striped jumper?

15:35.037 --> 15:37.257
Who's this bloke here?

15:38.157 --> 15:40.957
We're never going to find him here.

15:47.677 --> 15:50.876
I'm currently working
on another assignment also.

15:50.877 --> 15:53.397
A lady is missing since last night.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.956
Seems mad, we're messing about
looking for this bloke,

15:56.957 --> 15:59.996
just to check if he smokes
and eats meat.

15:59.997 --> 16:03.976
Surely they should get all the
people out looking for the woman.

16:03.977 --> 16:05.756
Any joy?

16:05.757 --> 16:08.477
There he is! He's there! Yes, yes.

16:08.557 --> 16:11.017
Yeah, that's him, that's him.

16:11.177 --> 16:14.237
He's looking around,
he's got a red folder.

16:14.377 --> 16:17.597
He's looking well guilty.
He's looking shifty.

16:17.657 --> 16:20.317
Why's he reading that there now?

16:20.477 --> 16:23.357
He's got his phone out.
I reckon he's calling a woman.

16:23.517 --> 16:26.537
He's definitely meeting someone
because he was on the phone.

16:26.657 --> 16:31.196
The way he's walking around,
sort of not aiming anywhere...

16:31.197 --> 16:33.017
Could be staying somewhere tonight.

16:33.077 --> 16:36.637
Would people who have a meeting
wear a rucksack like that?

16:36.797 --> 16:40.617
Or could that have a change
of clothing? It's a bit weird,

16:40.797 --> 16:43.356
to take a rucksack to a meeting.

16:43.357 --> 16:46.236
I carry a rucksack to work.

16:46.237 --> 16:48.137
Folder's gone in the bag.

16:48.317 --> 16:51.517
Bottle of water.
It looks like sparkling.

16:54.537 --> 16:57.117
Definitely him, isn't it?
Definitely.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.636
Yeah, his hair is sort of
very... bouffant.

17:00.637 --> 17:02.857
He's meant to be working. He's not.

17:02.937 --> 17:05.757
Should send this video to his boss.

17:05.916 --> 17:08.617
"Do you know what
your employee's up to?"

17:08.777 --> 17:12.156
Wandering around car parks,
drinking water...

17:12.317 --> 17:15.036
It's lunch though. Lunch time.
Is it?

17:15.037 --> 17:17.436
Why aren't we having lunch?

17:18.396 --> 17:21.737
I'm starving.
Do you want a bit of that cake?

17:23.676 --> 17:26.077
Do you want some food?

17:29.117 --> 17:31.337
Fucking hell. Where did he go?

17:31.517 --> 17:33.257
You stay here.

17:36.477 --> 17:39.017
Jesus. I took me eye off him
for a second.

17:39.177 --> 17:41.897
Just looking at
the chocolate brownie.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.057
It's sort of like Oreo.

17:59.497 --> 18:01.596
What was he doing?

18:01.597 --> 18:04.297
He was smoking.
He wasn't!

18:04.957 --> 18:08.217
The way he's holding that,
I wouldn't say he's a heavy smoker.

18:08.277 --> 18:11.516
Smoker...
He looks like a light smoker,

18:11.517 --> 18:16.637
the way he's holding it right in
the middle of his mouth, like that.

18:16.797 --> 18:19.656
But he's smoking.
He's smoking, yeah.

18:19.657 --> 18:22.556
So what do we do now?
We've seen him smoking.

18:22.557 --> 18:26.077
Might be possible he's supposed
to meet with any girl here.

18:26.237 --> 18:29.257
Right, he's gone.
He's in the rickshaw.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.677
My team is there.

18:31.837 --> 18:34.657
Well, what are we here for, then?

18:35.677 --> 18:39.016
If there's another team,
why are we all following this bloke,

18:39.017 --> 18:41.097
just because he's having a fag?

18:41.277 --> 18:44.797
It's hardly fucking
crime of the century, is it?

18:44.937 --> 18:47.997
He might've started smoking today
because he's nervous.

18:48.157 --> 18:51.017
He's about to get married.
Has anyone thought of that?

18:51.177 --> 18:53.437
What a job this is.

19:09.817 --> 19:12.157
What have you got there, Karl?

19:12.297 --> 19:14.236
Wedding invitation.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.917
I knew it would happen. Can't make
a programme about weddings

19:18.077 --> 19:20.797
without actually
having to go to one.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.799
But I can't say
I'm looking forward to it.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.139
I'm just going to be
helping out a wedding planner

19:27.140 --> 19:32.419
who's... They've got to sort
everything out, start to finish.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.840
When we get an invite that size,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.679
I don't want Suzanne to see it
because she'll go "We should go."

19:38.680 --> 19:41.219
It's the same as getting jury duty,
to me.

19:41.220 --> 19:45.060
You can't get out of it. I didn't
want to do it, can't get out of it,

19:45.080 --> 19:48.259
and it's the same
with a wedding invite.

19:48.260 --> 19:51.639
Just because they love each other,
they drag other people into it -

19:51.640 --> 19:54.499
get on with it.
Get married, get on with it.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.980
E-mail us the pictures, we're happy
to have a look. Just... annoys me.

20:03.460 --> 20:08.500
It's a small wedding. The reception
is 3,000 people. That's ridiculous.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.880
We need to make sure, given the
time and money spent by the family,

20:13.060 --> 20:15.460
that we make this wedding
a real success.

20:15.620 --> 20:18.679
It's their once-in-a-lifetime event.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.819
We go to the groom's house now.
Please help him get ready.

20:22.820 --> 20:26.520
There's things he needs to put on
his head. Make sure it's straight.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.699
Here's your outfit.
You think you'll be comfortable?

20:29.700 --> 20:31.640
It's all right, that.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.700
Have you been told what to do?

20:37.880 --> 20:41.880
Basically just a shit shifter for
the day, by the sounds of things.

20:42.020 --> 20:45.400
Got to make sure
the groom's hat's on straight.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.760
That's when you know
an event's overstaffed,

20:48.920 --> 20:52.660
when you've got someone whose job it
is to go "It's a bit... Perfect."

20:52.900 --> 20:55.959
Seriously.
The state that India's in,

20:55.960 --> 20:58.520
the amount of things
that do need staff

20:58.680 --> 21:01.700
and yet I'm walking around,
watching a fella's hat.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.560
That's the problem with India. I've
been watching someone having a fag.

21:05.620 --> 21:08.900
What about the important things
that need sorting?

21:20.580 --> 21:23.960
You'll be with the groom.
Make sure that he's ready

21:24.120 --> 21:28.740
and at 10.15 sharp, you start
assembling everybody for the temple.

21:28.820 --> 21:32.080
How are you?
This is the groom's brother.

21:33.380 --> 21:36.440
He's the next one to get married.
Right, yeah.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.800
Is she all right? Happy today?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.520
Oh, the bride, right.

21:43.460 --> 21:46.500
Is there anything else
you'd like him to do?

21:48.740 --> 21:51.160
There's the groom.
Oh, hello.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.240
How are you? How you feeling?

21:53.860 --> 21:56.599
Yeah? Can we starting
getting everybody ready?

21:56.600 --> 21:58.980
There's a lot going on.

21:59.780 --> 22:03.459
What about the pressure of people
saying "You have to find someone" -

22:03.460 --> 22:05.719
does that annoy you?

22:05.720 --> 22:08.279
You'll find someone
when you're ready.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.940
Can you make sure you see
how the thing is tied?

22:14.280 --> 22:16.420
Twist it... It looks so nice.

22:23.620 --> 22:27.459
Cover the head...
That is some setup on the telly.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.080
Is that all for the TV?

22:34.020 --> 22:36.280
It's mad, isn't it?

22:36.440 --> 22:38.340
You got a music channel?

22:42.180 --> 22:45.859
Can we forget this and concentrate
there? I'm keeping an eye...

22:45.860 --> 22:48.920
You have to
because if it comes off...

22:48.980 --> 22:51.319
Let's go check upstairs.

22:51.320 --> 22:55.140
Karl, please make sure you know it.
I'll tuck it in. Thank you.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.680
Just like that...

22:57.860 --> 22:59.479
Good sound.

22:59.480 --> 23:02.980
Listen to that.

23:04.260 --> 23:06.680
Can everybody come through, please?

23:06.840 --> 23:09.040
Stairs that way, lift that way.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.459
Can other people use the stairs?

23:11.460 --> 23:14.199
Everybody to the basement, please.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.219
We're not messing around,
we're actually leaving now.

23:17.220 --> 23:20.419
Come on. It's good
that you're asking them to go,

23:20.420 --> 23:23.640
but please try to be polite
because it's a marriage home.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.779
We need to be assertive,
but not... I did say "Please".

23:27.780 --> 23:31.639
I understand, but I want you to
keep that in your mind, that's all.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.040
Can we go now?

23:34.140 --> 23:36.280
OK?

23:37.240 --> 23:39.960
Look, if they don't come...
I've told them.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.700
Right, we're actually
shutting the door now.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.239
If it's covering your eye,
just give it a push.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.799
Is there enough room for another?

23:55.800 --> 23:58.800
When they said that
these weddings last for ever,

23:58.980 --> 24:02.200
it's because they couldn't be arsed
going through this again.

24:02.340 --> 24:06.200
This is what we should do at home.
It would make people stay together.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.180
Karl? Hang on,
it's happening, it's happening.

24:18.840 --> 24:22.840
Are you all right?
It's fine, just keep pushing it up.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.080
Let me show you the food.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.400
So all these things
get served to the guests.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.420
There are about
25 different dishes here.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.780
You know I don't like crowds?
It's busy.

24:35.860 --> 24:38.660
That noise... What is that?

24:42.760 --> 24:45.520
It's that... that high-pitched one.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.600
You know when you've got
a wasp behind a curtain

24:48.760 --> 24:52.420
and its wings go mental?
It's like that - v-v-v...

24:53.700 --> 24:56.420
It's not musical. It's just noise.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.640
This one... Karl?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.199
A tiny bit, yeah? OK.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.539
Karl, you can be a little quicker.

25:09.540 --> 25:12.599
Karl, don't ask
whether people want one or two.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.680
But some people were doing that...

25:14.820 --> 25:16.920
How many do you want? Two?

25:17.060 --> 25:18.659
Karl? Ohh...

25:18.660 --> 25:21.539
The family seemed to enjoy it.
Yeah, the mum's loving it.

25:21.540 --> 25:26.040
His brother looks as if
he's enjoying it as much as I am.

25:26.200 --> 25:30.680
I caught him stood there, nodding
his head, like "What is this about?"

25:30.800 --> 25:33.880
He's probably thinking
"I've got to do all this."

25:34.020 --> 25:37.399
You can't even say "I'm gay"
because gays get married now.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.060
Even that's not an excuse.

25:39.120 --> 25:43.800
I couldn't even do this.
I haven't got this many family.

25:43.960 --> 25:49.040
All the numbers in me mobile phone
wouldn't fill this row of tables.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.760
I hardly know anyone. But I want
to keep it that way, to be honest.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.359
She's younger than me.
Maybe she's on Twitter -

25:58.360 --> 26:02.199
you have thousands of followers,
even though you don't know them,

26:02.200 --> 26:05.220
put on there "I'm getting married,
do you want to come?"

26:05.300 --> 26:10.020
That's the problem, it gets
way out of hand. Way out of hand.

26:23.460 --> 26:27.139
This is the entrance
where the guests will walk in from.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.200
This is where the waiters
will have welcome drinks.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.100
The ushers will be here.

26:32.180 --> 26:36.120
Can you make sure all the candles
are lit? Yeah, I'll do that now.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.240
Hi. Candle's out.
I think this will not light up.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.939
No, looks burnt, the wick.

26:43.940 --> 26:46.780
Can I leave that with you?
There's another one over here.

26:46.807 --> 26:49.827
$200,000.
They got some cheap candles.

26:52.407 --> 26:55.587
Peanuts or snacks? You're OK?
No problem.

26:55.767 --> 26:59.927
See the two men in the corner?
They want chicken.

27:00.305 --> 27:02.545
Looking a bit low on peanuts.

27:02.605 --> 27:04.605
Need any more peanuts?

27:05.265 --> 27:07.664
You're all right?

27:07.665 --> 27:11.024
It's mental. It's proper mental.

27:11.025 --> 27:15.324
Vik's going to be there - it started
at eight - till 11, shaking hands.

27:15.325 --> 27:19.785
And they're filming it all to hand
out to people who couldn't make it.

27:19.965 --> 27:23.185
Who couldn't make it?
There's 5,000 people.

27:23.345 --> 27:27.004
How many people do they know?
I just wouldn't record it.

27:27.005 --> 27:31.645
William and Kate, it was on the BBC.
Bet they didn't record it.

27:31.805 --> 27:35.185
You don't watch it back. It happens
and then you get on with your life.

27:37.105 --> 27:39.805
This is stupid. Ridiculous.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.685
How many people are there? 5,000?

27:42.865 --> 27:44.784
How many toilets?

27:44.785 --> 27:46.545
Two.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.525
And the amount of peanuts
I've been handing out.

27:50.665 --> 27:53.425
It's going to get pretty busy here.

28:15.485 --> 28:20.784
What have you got there, Karl?
It's a sort of invite

28:20.785 --> 28:24.145
to a pheromone party
going on in LA.

28:24.305 --> 28:26.205
And, er,

28:26.385 --> 28:29.245
it's just another way
of meeting people.

28:29.325 --> 28:32.125
But with a bit of science involved.

28:32.205 --> 28:35.824
It's the smell. Based on smell.

28:35.825 --> 28:38.545
Like dogs.
They sniff each other's arse.

28:38.685 --> 28:42.525
They don't go "Try a chat-up line"
or "I like the look of that one",

28:42.705 --> 28:46.365
they go to the arse, like the smell,
then do what they've got to do.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.745
At the end of the day,
we're animals, aren't we?

28:49.905 --> 28:52.625
So maybe we should
take something from that.

29:01.105 --> 29:02.705
What's your name? Karl.

29:05.374 --> 29:08.054
You're number 50. That's important
for you to remember.

29:08.087 --> 29:10.487
Pay attention to the screen here

29:10.647 --> 29:14.326
because women who like your set
will take your bag and hold it up

29:14.327 --> 29:18.787
and then you'll see what they look
like and go find them at the party.

29:23.267 --> 29:26.947
That's nicer than that one.
Yeah? You go for it.

29:28.867 --> 29:31.607
Ooh, Jesus. That should be binned.

29:35.127 --> 29:37.207
Oh, that is a bloke's?

29:38.387 --> 29:41.367
Oh, right, right. Fuck me.

29:43.907 --> 29:46.147
I'm having that one.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.427
What you could do is take 'em all,
play it safe.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.487
Did I? Which one were you?

30:05.847 --> 30:07.927
What did you like about it?

30:08.087 --> 30:12.886
29. Can I have a smell again? Or
I can smell you. You don't remember?

30:12.887 --> 30:16.866
I remember liking it, but
I've had me nose in a lot of stuff.

30:16.867 --> 30:19.867
Have you just willy-nilly
been choosing shirts

30:20.067 --> 30:21.847
that smelled?

30:21.927 --> 30:23.927
Just like, one, two, three...

30:24.087 --> 30:26.326
No, no. I wasn't just... No, no.

30:26.327 --> 30:28.706
I've put some back.

30:28.707 --> 30:31.747
Let me just...
You were choosing willy-nilly.

30:31.907 --> 30:34.807
No, I wasn't!
You can't remember which one's mine.

30:34.967 --> 30:38.127
I picked three.
I smelt it for, like, 20 seconds.

30:38.327 --> 30:41.527
You're not going to commit to one?
You're going to choose three?

30:41.667 --> 30:44.887
You smelt nice. Three out of three?
You were me favourite.

30:45.047 --> 30:49.507
I would be complimented
if you remembered which one I was.

30:49.587 --> 30:51.607
I liked it at the time.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.826
OK, which one was it?

30:53.827 --> 30:56.086
20-something. 23.

30:56.087 --> 30:59.427
No. Sorry.
So that's it? That's it.

30:59.447 --> 31:01.987
Fuck me. It's hard, innit?

31:09.427 --> 31:11.427
I think you picked my T-shirt.

31:13.507 --> 31:15.507
Oh, chocolatey. It is chocolatey.

31:15.767 --> 31:18.487
You like chocolate?
I do, admittedly!

31:18.607 --> 31:21.527
You like Revels? Revels...

31:21.647 --> 31:24.947
You get a Malteser,
you get a nut-covered chocolate,

31:25.007 --> 31:27.426
caramel - it's a mixed bag.

31:27.427 --> 31:32.406
That sounds amazing! What else
do you like? I do like facts.

31:32.407 --> 31:37.667
When koalas are born, they get
the gut flora to digest eucalyptus

31:37.747 --> 31:40.227
by eating their mum's shit.

31:40.407 --> 31:42.967
Do you know what a wombat is?
I do, yes.

31:43.127 --> 31:45.846
When a wombat shits, it's square.

31:45.847 --> 31:48.566
I like that about you,
that you know that.

31:48.567 --> 31:52.566
In every sort of romantic film,
there's a woman with glasses on...

31:52.567 --> 31:54.627
Hello, can I help you?

31:57.207 --> 31:59.447
Which number were you?

32:00.547 --> 32:02.967
Yeah, I thought it was all right.

32:03.047 --> 32:04.887
Yeah, it was nice.

32:06.167 --> 32:08.887
It just smelt like you were clean.

32:09.027 --> 32:11.447
That's all I wanted, really.

32:11.587 --> 32:13.506
Not too much perfume.

32:13.507 --> 32:17.527
And it matches you. You don't have
loads of makeup, a bit on the eyes.

32:17.687 --> 32:20.227
Simple, not overdone...

32:21.527 --> 32:23.126
What's that?

32:23.127 --> 32:25.346
Pie? You like pie?

32:25.347 --> 32:27.266
I love the smell of pie.

32:27.267 --> 32:29.526
Sarah. Nice to see you.

32:29.527 --> 32:31.447
No, it's good...

32:32.947 --> 32:34.947
I did, yeah.

32:35.647 --> 32:37.487
Er...

32:45.687 --> 32:48.647
I think there's something in this.
It's going back to basics.

32:48.787 --> 32:52.087
It's what cavemen would've done.
Or cavewomen, to meet the man.

32:52.147 --> 32:56.246
They couldn't even speak,
they couldn't do themselves up,

32:56.247 --> 32:58.486
they didn't have perfumes.

32:58.487 --> 33:01.526
So the only thing they had, really,
would've been their smell.

33:01.527 --> 33:05.047
And that's what we've done tonight.
It's gone back to basics.

33:06.887 --> 33:10.327
The only problem is is that

33:10.467 --> 33:14.326
it was like me nose has got...
standards that...

33:14.327 --> 33:17.427
are sort of unachievable for me.

33:17.687 --> 33:21.027
Higher standards
than it should have, really.

33:21.047 --> 33:25.346
Because it's attached to me and I'm
not going to get the women it wants.

33:25.347 --> 33:28.866
I don't know who it thinks I am.
That's the problem.

33:28.867 --> 33:31.926
Yeah, you liked my scent, but
you don't know which number it was.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.146
Oh, shut up. Shut up.

33:34.147 --> 33:36.226
You're doing me head in.

33:36.227 --> 33:38.786
Fucking hell. Proper mental.

33:38.787 --> 33:41.427
She's busting your balls. She is.

33:59.289 --> 34:02.209
What annoys me with
overseas weddings is the invite.

34:02.309 --> 34:05.889
You've got a mate who's decided
to get married in Canada.

34:06.029 --> 34:09.408
You get an invite saying "We'd love
you to be there" - that annoys me.

34:09.409 --> 34:12.588
You've got to pay for a flight
and hotel and take time off

34:12.589 --> 34:15.967
because he's getting married
in Canada. I'm happy for them,

34:15.969 --> 34:18.049
but are they having a laugh?

34:18.188 --> 34:21.248
Who in their right mind
would do that?

34:21.248 --> 34:24.748
They're trying to make it more
special. But that's lovely for them.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.829
It makes me laugh.

34:27.009 --> 34:30.027
As if...
"I don't know if you're passing..."

34:30.029 --> 34:32.908
"No, it's in Canada!
Ten hours on a plane!"

34:32.909 --> 34:36.929
There's no way in this world
I'd do that. No way.

34:42.849 --> 34:47.168
So they stick the chapels
on main roads like this? Yeah.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.228
That's weird, innit?

34:49.228 --> 34:51.789
There's a drive-through one.

34:52.849 --> 34:55.309
It is a drive-through wedding.

34:55.469 --> 34:59.649
Are you sure, if I drive through,
we won't get involved in a wedding?

34:59.729 --> 35:01.729
It's good, innit?

35:05.569 --> 35:07.788
I'm not a fan of these.

35:07.789 --> 35:09.869
Cherubs. Why not?

35:09.929 --> 35:13.249
They're sinister. Considering
they're meant to represent love,

35:13.333 --> 35:15.253
I don't get it. Babies with wings.

35:16.328 --> 35:19.488
And they haven't got nappies on,
so that's causing a load of hassle.

35:19.496 --> 35:21.856
Flying around, shitting everywhere.

35:22.308 --> 35:25.968
You want to get married in the
drive-through? How long's it take?

35:26.048 --> 35:28.228
Ten minutes.

35:29.508 --> 35:32.368
That's good, that.
It goes like this...

35:32.448 --> 35:34.948
What is your name? Karl.

35:35.108 --> 35:37.007
Your girlfriend's name? Suzanne.

35:37.008 --> 35:39.748
Karl, will you take Suzanne
to be your wife?

35:39.782 --> 35:42.342
Will you promise
to love and honour her

35:42.502 --> 35:46.202
respect her and keep her
all your life? Yep.

35:46.342 --> 35:51.162
And, Suzanne, will you take Karl
for your husband? Yeah.

35:51.322 --> 35:54.502
Will you promise him
that you will love and honour him,

35:54.622 --> 35:58.362
respect him and keep him
all the days of your life? Yep.

35:58.522 --> 36:04.102
You have chosen this beautiful lady
because you want to be with her.

36:04.122 --> 36:07.961
It's no accident
that you're together.

36:07.962 --> 36:11.142
She wants to be loved by you... Yep.

36:11.322 --> 36:13.721
And you want to be loved by her.

36:13.722 --> 36:17.382
And when that's going on,
engine - leave it running?

36:17.562 --> 36:22.342
Or turn it off? We'd say no.
We say no. No engine running.

36:25.222 --> 36:28.101
Are you going to pick out her dress?

36:28.102 --> 36:31.322
Or are you going to give her
a description?

36:31.482 --> 36:35.142
Is she tiny?
Or big? Or little? Or tall?

36:35.322 --> 36:37.721
She's not little.
Is she tall?

36:37.722 --> 36:40.742
Not really. If she was taller,
she wouldn't be as big.

36:40.902 --> 36:44.441
That's the problem - she's got
too much skin for her bones.

36:44.442 --> 36:47.642
I'm not having a go.
She knows I love her.

36:47.782 --> 36:50.681
She's quite plump.
No, not plump. That sounds bad.

36:50.682 --> 36:54.902
No, she's...
She's, er... She's not thin.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.921
You don't want a dress?

36:56.922 --> 37:00.742
No. I think she should just wear
what she normally wears.

37:01.522 --> 37:05.862
Well, a chapel... I'm not
really that bothered about...

37:06.042 --> 37:08.902
If I was to get married...
This is where you'd go.

37:09.082 --> 37:11.482
I think I'd do the drive-through.

37:11.642 --> 37:14.822
You don't want to walk
down the aisle? No, definitely.

37:15.002 --> 37:18.501
No, this is what I don't want.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.421
No.

37:20.422 --> 37:23.002
You don't?
No.

37:23.142 --> 37:26.202
We are gathered here today,
in the presence of God,

37:26.362 --> 37:29.402
to celebrate ten years
of holy matrimony together.

37:29.562 --> 37:33.081
If I was to do it -
honestly, I'm not messing about -

37:33.082 --> 37:37.402
if, for some reason, I had to
get married, I'd be happy with this.

37:37.562 --> 37:39.642
It's like a McDonald's.

37:39.722 --> 37:42.362
You come in, straight up to there,

37:42.482 --> 37:44.421
"I do"

37:44.422 --> 37:46.142
and out.

37:46.322 --> 37:48.902
That's how it should be.
Done in ten minutes.

37:49.082 --> 37:52.582
You order a Filet-o-Fish, you can
wait that time if it's not ready.

38:06.682 --> 38:08.922
What's the plan, then?

38:09.082 --> 38:13.242
The journey's been all about
marriage, why people do it,

38:13.322 --> 38:15.642
different ways that they do it.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.942
And I'm here today
just to sort out a wedding.

38:19.962 --> 38:22.021
A couple called Jon and Angie,

38:22.022 --> 38:24.122
who are getting married.

38:24.262 --> 38:28.762
They haven't got loads of money,
not like Vik and Deepa in India,

38:28.922 --> 38:32.982
they haven't got shitloads of money
to chuck at a massive event.

38:33.042 --> 38:36.402
But they've let me
come up with a concept for them.

38:36.602 --> 38:40.902
It's a little bit fancier than the
drive-through wedding that goes on,

38:41.082 --> 38:44.262
but, you know, still simple, small.

38:45.242 --> 38:47.962
Everything that I've been saying
from the start, really.

38:51.622 --> 38:53.622
All right, Charlotte?
Hi!

38:53.682 --> 38:57.062
Come on, let's get in,
get this sorted out. OK.

38:57.222 --> 39:01.562
I came up with this idea after
being at the pheromone party in LA.

39:01.642 --> 39:04.101
Your smell is important.

39:04.102 --> 39:06.842
Your smell in your clothes,
your pheromones -

39:06.922 --> 39:08.822
it's important in a relationship.

39:08.882 --> 39:11.482
What's the idea, then?

39:11.542 --> 39:15.641
Well, the couple are going
to come in, with their washing,

39:15.642 --> 39:18.682
have a basket each,
have a proper whiff of it,

39:18.822 --> 39:21.342
making sure they're happy
with the smell.

39:21.362 --> 39:24.922
Chuck it in the machine.
Two lots of dirty washing

39:25.002 --> 39:27.161
sort of become one.

39:27.162 --> 39:29.502
We are gathered here today

39:29.522 --> 39:31.961
at the laundromat

39:31.962 --> 39:34.502
in Las Vegas, Nevada...

39:34.662 --> 39:37.722
Why does it matter where
a wedding is? It's just a building.

39:37.882 --> 39:42.342
People get married in a church
and I know they're not religious

39:42.362 --> 39:45.701
and they love it all -
it's a church and it's all proper

39:45.702 --> 39:49.862
and you dress up and have
the bell going. What's the bell for?

39:49.882 --> 39:53.401
It's just annoying. They know you're
getting married - you sent invites.

39:53.402 --> 39:56.742
They'll be there.
You don't have to make a racket.

39:56.902 --> 40:01.221
This moment is what you have waited
for - to belong to each other.

40:01.222 --> 40:04.741
And today is the most important day
of your life.

40:04.742 --> 40:07.001
It makes me laugh on Relocation

40:07.002 --> 40:11.622
when people go "I want to live
in a nice village with a church."

40:11.642 --> 40:15.322
Why? Every weekend, someone's gets
married - those bells are going off.

40:15.482 --> 40:18.342
Car alarms piss you off,
but what about a church?

40:18.522 --> 40:23.001
Will you please change
your dirty baskets?

40:23.002 --> 40:26.682
At least in here - it's pretty quiet
these days with tumble dryers.

40:26.842 --> 40:30.202
At this time, I would like for you

40:30.342 --> 40:34.342
to sniff each other's dirty laundry,
please.

40:39.382 --> 40:43.941
This is the point now. If you don't
like it, you're best saying now

40:43.942 --> 40:47.302
and we can knock this on the head
and you can go home.

40:47.482 --> 40:50.662
So you've had a smell.
Are you definitely happy?

40:50.822 --> 40:52.902
Definitely? Definitely.
Definitely.

40:53.062 --> 40:55.481
Really? Yes. Yeah?

40:55.482 --> 40:58.521
Definitely. Definitely. Great, Jon.

40:58.522 --> 41:02.042
So, at this time,
we would like to have you

41:02.182 --> 41:06.342
take your dirty laundry
and put it in the machine

41:06.362 --> 41:09.702
so that the beautiful fragrance
of each other

41:09.722 --> 41:12.122
can blend in together.

41:12.202 --> 41:14.322
Take one last smell.

41:15.962 --> 41:19.922
Ahh. It is science.
You can't argue with science.

41:20.002 --> 41:22.682
If you like the smell of someone,

41:22.762 --> 41:24.921
then you should be together, maybe.

41:24.922 --> 41:29.081
I do think it's an important part
of a relationship.

41:29.082 --> 41:32.822
The big wedding that we saw in India
with Vik and Deepa,

41:32.882 --> 41:37.061
they have organised weddings
over there, arranged marriages.

41:37.062 --> 41:40.742
Is it because they can't use smell
there because of spices and things?

41:40.902 --> 41:44.762
You're not smelling the real person
because you're eating masala

41:44.922 --> 41:47.961
and tamarind and all those spices.

41:47.962 --> 41:50.962
You're getting the smells
of what they're eating.

41:51.162 --> 41:54.822
Maybe that's why they've got to
have arranged marriages. Might be.

41:54.902 --> 41:57.402
Do you know what I mean?
Makes sense.

41:59.322 --> 42:03.802
So now that we have cleared
all of the dirty laundry

42:03.942 --> 42:07.461
and everything is nice
and fresh and clean,

42:07.462 --> 42:10.661
I would like for you both
to hold hands.

42:10.662 --> 42:13.081
Repeat after me.

42:13.082 --> 42:15.642
I, Jonathan...
I, Jonathan...

42:15.702 --> 42:18.522
take thee, Angela...
..take thee, Angela...

42:18.622 --> 42:20.921
for my wife.
..for my wife.

42:20.922 --> 42:23.301
To love you and trust you...

42:23.302 --> 42:26.661
to be faithful to you...
..to be faithful to you...

42:26.662 --> 42:29.401
all the days of my life.
..all the days of my life.

42:29.402 --> 42:33.721
By the power vested in me
by the state of Nevada,

42:33.722 --> 42:38.042
I do now pronounce you husband
and wife, together for ever.

42:38.662 --> 42:41.082
You may now sniff your bride.

42:42.822 --> 42:44.921
Not bad, is it?

42:44.922 --> 42:47.962
Considering the end result
is the same as the one in India.

42:48.122 --> 42:49.722
And they got their washing done.

42:52.262 --> 42:54.841
I mean, you can't fault it.

42:54.842 --> 43:00.121
It may not be everyone's cup of tea,
but surely this makes more sense.

43:00.122 --> 43:04.441
Doesn't it? It's a special day.
