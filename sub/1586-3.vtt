WEBVTT

01:27.000 --> 01:27.990
Okay.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.992
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit!

01:58.160 --> 02:02.791
No, wait.
Tell him... tell him
I'll pay it all back.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.317
I-- I-- I swear...
No, no...

02:43.400 --> 02:44.914
Please!

02:47.840 --> 02:49.320
For the love...

02:49.400 --> 02:51.312
I got kids.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.352
Don't move.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.557
Please, please.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.352
<i>She won't stop,
you know.</i>

04:36.680 --> 04:41.038
<i>...first
prize is three fun-filled
days in Bismarck.</i>

04:41.120 --> 04:42.839
<i>So get your entries in
lickety-split.</i>

04:42.920 --> 04:44.115
<i>The contest ends Friday.</i>

05:07.680 --> 05:08.830
<i>Pleased to meet you.</i>

05:08.960 --> 05:10.838
<i>So, uh, this is
where he worked?
Yeah...</i>

05:10.920 --> 05:12.400
in accounting.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.119
Just typing away
and this other fella
comes in,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.431
drags poor Phil
out by the necktie.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.193
Nice guy, too.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.715
Super. Such a pity.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.870
Gambling problem,
I heard.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.519
You don't say?
I heard drugs.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.956
I heard he,
like, slept with
a 13-year-old girl.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.394
For Pete's sake, Bob!
Don't spread rumors
about the poor man.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.000
No, it was
gambling, for sure.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.595
I got the security tape
queued up downstairs.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.670
Want to see that?

05:38.760 --> 05:39.750
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.554
Hard to tell much.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.239
Like I said.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.518
Can you freeze
it there?

05:57.520 --> 05:59.671
You say you found
the victim's clothes
in the garage?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.433
Phil? Yeah.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.116
Lab says the fella
cut 'em off with a knife?
Damn peculiar.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.271
So, you think
this is your guy?

06:07.360 --> 06:09.352
The one who killed
all those people
over in Bemidji?

06:09.440 --> 06:11.193
Could be.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.272
It's a nasty enough fella.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.840
Who are you?

06:26.160 --> 06:27.230
Great job, okay?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.959
In through the nose and
out through the mouth.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.319
Ladies, you are
looking great, okay?
Keep up the good work.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.073
Well, hello, you.

06:36.160 --> 06:41.440
You got bronzer on
your blackmail note.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.595
Listen, listen, listen.
I swear on my--

06:47.680 --> 06:50.832
You couldn't
find a smaller room
for us to talk in?

06:50.920 --> 06:51.990
What?

06:52.080 --> 06:53.116
Nothing.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.317
Look, this...
this whole thing,

06:55.400 --> 06:57.517
huge mistake.
Okay, I never meant...

06:59.640 --> 07:04.431
See, I just...
I just wanted something
for Don, you know?

07:04.520 --> 07:07.718
You done?

07:07.800 --> 07:09.871
Here it is.
You're screwed.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.873
You made a choice
and this is the consequence.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.394
Me, I'm the consequence.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.473
Please, please
don't tell Helena.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.755
I don't work for Helena.

07:18.840 --> 07:23.232
I work for her husband,
Stavros Milos,
the Supermarket King.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.880
Oh, my God.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.520
Oh.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.274
Here. Squeeze this.
Yeah.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.312
Oh, no.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.040
You ready?

07:42.120 --> 07:46.717
I've got two questions
and one comment, understand?

07:46.800 --> 07:51.670
First question,
why $43,613?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.477
Gonna start a Turkish bath.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.153
See, back in
the Ottoman Empire--

07:57.240 --> 08:00.392
Second question,
what do you know?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.711
About what?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.440
Stavros, the guy
you're blackmailing.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.512
You wrote a note,
"I know about the money."

08:07.600 --> 08:08.954
What do you know?

08:09.040 --> 08:12.829
Uh... Nothing, really.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.755
I mean, Helena told
the story so much...

08:16.840 --> 08:20.038
about her husband
and how he lies
about his money.

08:20.120 --> 08:24.592
So you're blackmailing
a guy for something but
you don't know what it is?

08:26.160 --> 08:28.391
Are you ready
for the comment?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.150
You're an idiot.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.432
Good news.
I'm taking over.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.994
Taking over what?

08:37.120 --> 08:38.474
The blackmail.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.677
You work for the guy.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.193
Exactly.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.797
And now you work for me.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.120
I'm confused.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.351
That's okay. I'm not.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.433
The first thing we need
is a new blackmail letter.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.838
Hey, Maggie.
Lieutenant in?

09:48.760 --> 09:49.830
What?

09:51.040 --> 09:54.351
He's in the bathroom.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.960
Ah.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.154
Um...

10:06.240 --> 10:07.594
Lieutenant?

10:07.680 --> 10:09.080
What?

10:09.160 --> 10:11.231
I'm takin' a dump.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.079
Yeah, so, listen.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.471
About that triple
homicide over Bemidji?

10:18.560 --> 10:22.031
Oh, for Christ's sake,
talk to your shift
commander.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.557
Well, yeah,
I would, you know,
but he don't listen to me.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.552
Who's this?
Dan Hoskins?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.998
Uh, no, sir.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.116
Gus Grimly.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.078
Grimly?

10:33.160 --> 10:36.471
For Christ's sake,
aren't you animal
control?

10:36.560 --> 10:40.679
No. I... I just sub
for those fellas
sometimes.

10:40.760 --> 10:46.552
So, listen...
I pulled this car over
the other night, a speeder.

10:46.640 --> 10:52.511
And, uh... well,
I let the guy go with
a warning, but then...

10:52.600 --> 10:54.637
Well, it turns out...

10:54.720 --> 10:59.397
I ran the fella's plates
on account of what you said

10:59.480 --> 11:03.474
at the briefing about
watching our P's and Q's.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.991
And, uh... well,
it turns out that the car

11:07.080 --> 11:09.276
belongs to one
of the... victims.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.633
One of the...
What?

11:22.920 --> 11:24.832
Are you kidding me?
No, sir.

11:24.920 --> 11:29.358
Lester Nygaard,
that's who the car
is registered to,

11:29.440 --> 11:31.318
but he wasn't
driving, obviously.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.110
So I'm thinking maybe
it might be the killer.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.190
Shut up.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.398
For Christ's sake!
You pulled over
a stolen car

11:39.520 --> 11:42.399
and let the guy
go with a warning?
Well-- It wasn't--

11:42.480 --> 11:46.759
See, it wasn't
listed as stolen, so--

11:46.840 --> 11:49.071
And now, I checked
this morning,

11:49.160 --> 11:50.640
and it's impounded,
as of yesterday, so--

11:50.720 --> 11:51.949
Stop.

11:53.560 --> 11:56.075
It's goddamn Sioux Falls
all over again.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.310
Yes, sir.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.950
What... what's
Sioux Falls?

12:00.040 --> 12:01.110
Shut up.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.911
You're gonna look
through every goddamn
mug book in the state.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.799
Yes, sir.
And you're
gonna find this guy.

12:09.880 --> 12:10.870
Yes, sir.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.559
And you're gonna
call Bemidji...

12:12.640 --> 12:17.078
and you're gonna tell them
that you screwed up. You.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.039
Absolving the rest of us
of any dipshittery.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.555
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.594
<i>He can afford it,
your brother.</i>

12:41.680 --> 12:43.433
<i>Kitty said he just
got a big promotion</i>

12:43.520 --> 12:45.079
<i>after only
working there a year.</i>

12:45.200 --> 12:46.600
<i>Kitty said they
also got one of those</i>

12:46.680 --> 12:48.000
<i>fancy new
surround sound systems.</i>

12:48.120 --> 12:51.318
<i>Guess I married
the wrong Nygaard.</i>

12:51.400 --> 12:53.596
<i>Or what?
What are you gonna do?</i>

12:53.680 --> 12:56.354
<i>You can't even face me
when we're having sex.</i>

12:58.920 --> 13:01.435
<i>Lester,
I need you to get
down on the ground.</i>

13:01.520 --> 13:03.079
<i>Hold on. Don't...
There's nothing down--</i>

13:03.160 --> 13:04.150
<i>Lester, on the ground.</i>

13:04.240 --> 13:05.276
<i>That's not-- I
didn't do nothing.</i>

13:05.360 --> 13:07.477
<i>I didn't...
I just got home.
I just got home and...</i>

13:07.560 --> 13:09.313
<i>Now, hold on. Hold on.</i>

13:09.400 --> 13:11.073
<i>Don't... There's
nothing down there--</i>

13:11.160 --> 13:12.719
<i>There's-- That is not--</i>

13:12.800 --> 13:14.075
I didn't do nothing!
I didn't do nothing!

13:14.160 --> 13:17.278
<i>I just came home.
I just came-- Oh, jeez.</i>

13:34.640 --> 13:36.916
Yeah, so I
closed it out with
a spare and a strike.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.430
Two-twenty-two.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.670
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.114
Lester.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.835
Well, I'll be--
Hey... Lester.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.634
I should've called,
I guess, huh?

13:51.720 --> 13:54.519
Please.
What can we do for ya?

13:54.600 --> 13:58.674
Well, I thought I'd...
do some work. You know,
get back to it.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.399
You're so brave.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.199
Jeez, ya think
you're ready?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.390
Think so.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.951
Yeah, I mean,
you can't just sit around
the house, you know?

14:07.600 --> 14:10.354
Good. Okay.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.750
You want to do
some filing or...

14:12.920 --> 14:15.355
I was gonna run
out to see Gina Hess.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.477
Who's that?
The widow Hess.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.916
Got some papers
for her to sign.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.036
Yeah.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.351
On account of Sam,
her husband.
He got murdered.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.635
Bo!

14:24.720 --> 14:26.473
Sorry,
was that insensitive?

14:26.560 --> 14:28.870
Anyways, did you want
to take that over to her?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.360
Which'd actually
help me out a lot,

14:30.440 --> 14:32.591
'cause I got a dentist
thing, you know, so...

14:32.680 --> 14:33.670
Um...

14:33.800 --> 14:35.678
But, I mean,
if you're not ready...
No, I'll...

14:35.760 --> 14:37.592
It's the 6-14 C, right?

14:37.680 --> 14:39.080
And D, yeah.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.279
Did you get
the soup I sent ya?

14:42.440 --> 14:44.113
Oh, yes, thank you.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.878
Well, I better
grab those forms.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.076
Mmm-hmm.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.356
Here we go. Come on.
Got it.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.634
Oh!
Hey.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.355
Whatcha doing
here, loser?

15:09.440 --> 15:11.796
Yeah, loser.
Whatcha doing here?

15:11.880 --> 15:13.758
Come on, boys.
I'm just here
to see your mom.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.990
Yeah?
Why, you want
to do her?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.230
Yeah, loser,
you gonna--

15:16.320 --> 15:18.676
Wait, he's not
really gonna have sex
with our ma, is he?

15:18.760 --> 15:20.035
He better not.
Nobody's--

15:21.640 --> 15:24.235
God damn it,
get off the guy.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.751
And quit shooting
up the lawn sign.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.516
Never gonna sell
this place, you keep
filling it with arrows.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.120
Yeah, they've sure
got a lot of energy, huh?

15:37.840 --> 15:39.115
They're wolves.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.556
What do you want?

15:41.640 --> 15:42.790
Well, ma'am. I'm--

15:42.920 --> 15:46.197
My name is Lester Nygaard
and I'm from Munk Insurance.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.800
Oh.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.634
Well, why didn't
you say so? Uh...

15:51.760 --> 15:53.638
Yeah, come on in.
Thank you.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.518
Do you want a whiskey?

15:55.680 --> 15:56.670
Oh, uh...

15:57.360 --> 15:59.033
Have a seat.
Oh, thank you.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.760
Sorry about the boys.
They're animals.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.830
Really.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.550
They fart on everything.
The walls, each other.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.792
When do I get my money?

16:10.320 --> 16:11.390
Uh...

16:11.480 --> 16:13.119
Can I... can I?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.435
Well, um...

16:15.840 --> 16:17.752
First of all, I would
just like to say

16:17.880 --> 16:20.714
how sorry I am
about your husband.
Mmm.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.876
We went to high
school together and...

16:23.000 --> 16:24.036
Yeah, that's sweet.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.157
But about the money...

16:28.080 --> 16:29.639
Yeah. Uh...

16:29.720 --> 16:32.474
Well, I have
some forms.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.511
Now in cases
where the deceased

16:35.640 --> 16:37.313
was killed--
Murdered, I mean...

16:37.400 --> 16:38.800
Mmm-hmm.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.679
...the process is
a little different.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.716
What do you mean?

16:42.800 --> 16:43.836
Well, and I'm going
through this myself.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.274
We have to wait
for the coroner--

16:45.400 --> 16:48.154
Wait a minute.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.833
You're that guy.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.149
I saw you at the cemetery.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.350
Oh, yeah, that's...

16:52.440 --> 16:55.831
Your wife was killed, right?
And the Chief of Police.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.875
He was murdered at
your house, right?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.155
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.430
I think you better
have that whiskey.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.920
You should
get back out there.
You know... date.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.354
You're not
a bad looking guy.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.511
A little small, maybe.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.835
Did you like her?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.154
Your wife.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.310
My husband was...

17:27.440 --> 17:29.875
Well, you knew
him, right?

17:29.960 --> 17:31.474
Didn't get better.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.916
Yeah, how did you...

17:34.000 --> 17:35.434
In Vegas.
Oh.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.399
I was a dancer.

17:38.480 --> 17:42.759
Well, a stripper,
if we're being honest.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.038
You ever been
to a strip club?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.032
No. No.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.077
Seriously?
No, I mean,

17:51.160 --> 17:53.311
you know, I always
wanted to, but...

17:53.400 --> 17:55.198
Well, I was good.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.350
Yeah.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.713
I got great tits...

18:00.800 --> 18:04.316
and I'm super flexible.
Oh, wow.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.197
Hi.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.912
And that is how I met Sam.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.071
And he started flashing
all this money around,

18:17.200 --> 18:20.034
telling me how he was gonna
take me away from it all.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.310
Blah, blah, blah.

18:22.520 --> 18:26.230
I was 19... so stupid.
Hmm.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.715
And now here I am
stuck in the Yukon with
my two mongoloid sons.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.439
Oh, they're
not so bad.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.035
I've taken shits
I wanna live with
more than them.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.190
Yeah.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.316
Now...

18:45.440 --> 18:47.750
So, tell me,
handsome--

18:47.880 --> 18:48.870
Oh...

18:50.600 --> 18:53.593
What's a girl got to do
to get that money...

18:55.400 --> 18:57.232
quick?

18:57.720 --> 19:02.192
'Cause I will
do anything.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.830
Oh, God.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.639
Sorry, man.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.439
Not again.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.591
Jesus.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.400
What'll it be, stretch?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.199
I need some Adderall.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.634
You got a test,
is that it?

19:44.720 --> 19:46.632
Big final, need to
pull an all-nighter?

19:46.720 --> 19:48.518
Exactly. High dosage, too.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.594
Just pretend
I'm a 300-pound 9-year-old
who can't finish a sentence.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.399
Here we go.
30 milligrams.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.233
Don't take two of these
and think you're gonna nap.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.515
It's basically speed.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.354
So why don't we say--
That'll work.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.190
How about
a zombie kit?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.195
What's that now?

20:11.840 --> 20:15.516
Zombie kit.
Shotgun, machete,
some Bactine.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.716
It's a side business.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.634
I make up these knapsacks
for the zombie apocalypse.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.837
You know,
in case the undead
come back to life

20:21.920 --> 20:23.957
and the world
gets all dog-eat-dog.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.517
It's already
dog-eat-dog, friend.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.952
Not sure what
worse a bunch of
zombies could do.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.877
Oh, my gosh!

20:47.960 --> 20:49.189
Look at you.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.840
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.435
So that's your
uniform, then?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.273
Yeah, yeah, this is it.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.790
And you got a gun
and everything.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.600
Nah, it's made
out of wood.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.160
Seriously?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.272
No, no, it's
a real gun.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.317
Oh.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.551
So, how's your
dad, then?
Great.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.279
Yeah, still got
the restaurant so...

21:14.360 --> 21:15.430
Fun.
Yeah.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.675
So, I heard about
what happened.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.790
The murders.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.439
Jeez.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.830
Yeah, yeah.
It's a muddy road so...

21:25.920 --> 21:27.320
I bet.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.434
You dating anyone?

21:30.520 --> 21:32.318
Me? No.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.516
No, you know me.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.831
I'm just an old
ship captain.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.432
You know, I'm
married to the sea.

21:40.480 --> 21:41.470
So, you live in
St. Paul, then?

21:41.560 --> 21:42.596
Yeah.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.876
Moved, like, right
after high school.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.316
Nothing ever happens
in Bemidji, ya know?

21:49.240 --> 21:50.959
And Ted got the job.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.833
Oh, yeah, yeah.
How's Ted?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.639
Good.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.200
We're divorced now.

21:56.280 --> 22:00.160
On account of...
he had intercourse with
his physical therapist.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.793
Oh, jeez.
But I'm doing good.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.200
Great, really.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.671
Been meeting men
on the Internet.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.830
Online dating?

22:08.920 --> 22:09.990
Oh, yeah.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.878
So, that's been fun.
Really?

22:11.960 --> 22:14.236
'Cause sometimes,
you know, you hear
stories, so...

22:14.320 --> 22:18.758
Well, from time to time,
you get a bad egg.

22:18.840 --> 22:23.357
Like, there was a fella...
had a harelip.

22:23.440 --> 22:27.832
And another stole
all my panties.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.876
But then I met Roger...
Mmm.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.351
...and we've been dating
about six months now.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.433
He took me to Acapulco.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.279
Ooh.
Yeah.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.640
Except he got
a spider bite,

22:46.760 --> 22:48.240
like, on his neck.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.595
And at first we thought
it was a mosquito,

22:49.720 --> 22:53.760
but it turns out
the spider laid eggs
in there or something,

22:53.840 --> 22:56.435
'cause we were in
the middle of doing it

22:56.560 --> 22:59.473
and all these
baby spiders popped
out of his neck.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.196
Jeez.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.317
Yeah, lesson learned,
you know?

23:04.400 --> 23:08.314
From now on, I am staying
right here in Minnesota.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.198
Sounds right.

23:10.280 --> 23:13.034
So... you girls ready
to order some food?

23:41.680 --> 23:42.670
King!

23:43.480 --> 23:45.233
Here, King!

23:48.160 --> 23:49.276
King!

23:50.960 --> 23:52.474

23:58.720 --> 24:00.518

24:12.960 --> 24:14.110

24:18.760 --> 24:20.353
Come to daddy!

24:23.720 --> 24:25.154
Kingie-the-King!

24:28.000 --> 24:29.719
Where's my
little monster?

24:41.440 --> 24:42.760
Here, boy.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.714
Come on, King.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.350
King!

24:53.360 --> 24:54.350
What the hell?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.480
King!

25:53.160 --> 25:54.594
<i>...before the worst happens,</i>

25:54.680 --> 25:56.956
<i>call the best,
Bo Munk Insurance.</i>

25:57.040 --> 25:59.316
<i>So come on down to
Bo Munk Insurance</i>

25:59.400 --> 26:02.313
<i>and see me, Bo Munk,
before it's too late.</i>

26:20.560 --> 26:21.994
Jesus.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.233
Oh, God.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.960
Is that...

26:41.200 --> 26:42.190
Oh...

26:57.440 --> 26:59.830
Lester?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.673
We're all of us
going for Arby's.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.559
Do ya... Can I
bring ya anything?

27:05.960 --> 27:08.680
No. No, thank you.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.798
Okay, well, see you
in a bit, then.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.193
Oh!

27:26.600 --> 27:29.559
You scared me there.
I thought the place was...

27:31.680 --> 27:33.512
I was...

27:42.520 --> 27:43.920
Oh, uh...

27:51.760 --> 27:55.356
Well, that's...
excuse me.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.954
Hello.
<i>Uh, Mr. Nygaard, please.</i>

27:57.040 --> 27:58.679
This is Lester.
<i>Yeah, Mr. Nygaard,</i>

27:58.760 --> 27:59.876
<i>this is Duluth Impound.</i>

27:59.960 --> 28:01.872
<i>Just want to let you know
we got your car.</i>

28:01.960 --> 28:03.189
Uh, pardon?

28:03.560 --> 28:06.439
<i>Your car, license 628633QI.</i>

28:06.520 --> 28:09.115
<i>Got towed yesterday from
Phoenix Farms on Elm.</i>

28:09.200 --> 28:10.236
In Duluth?

28:10.320 --> 28:11.356
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

28:11.440 --> 28:13.591
Oh, just take
anything you like.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.716
So what have I got to--

28:14.800 --> 28:16.871
<i>Just need proof of current
registration and $150</i>

28:16.960 --> 28:18.474
<i>and we'll
release the car to you.</i>
Okay, well, well--

28:18.560 --> 28:19.994
<i>We'll take cash only.</i>
Uh...

28:20.400 --> 28:22.153
Thanks for calling.
<i>Yeah, remember. Cash only.</i>

28:22.240 --> 28:23.879
Yeah.

28:23.960 --> 28:28.477
So...
what can I do for
you fellas, then?

28:28.600 --> 28:32.116
'Cause we're...
kind of busy right now.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.950
Hmm?

28:37.800 --> 28:38.916
What's that?

28:47.560 --> 28:48.755
No, sorry, I...

28:48.840 --> 28:50.274
Sam Hess.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.911
Are you fellas, uh,
family of his?

29:08.680 --> 29:11.115
Lester, we saw you
with the widow.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.270
Looked like you
were having a party.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.919
You celebrating, maybe?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.718
No, come on.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.150
God.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.112
I got a deaf cousin.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.994
Oh, uh...

29:27.560 --> 29:29.358
Hi.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.838
Uh, excuse me.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.350
Uh...

29:35.680 --> 29:40.197
Sorry about the door.
Not sure how that happened.

29:40.280 --> 29:41.600
Not interrupting
anything?

29:41.680 --> 29:44.036
No, no, no.
Just giving
these guys a quote.

29:44.120 --> 29:50.230
So, like I said, you know,
it's 300 a year,
plus 200 up front.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.113
Okay.
Look through that
and give me a call.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.716
Sounds good.
Talk soon, Lester. Deputy?

30:00.200 --> 30:01.793
Who were those
fellas, then?

30:02.560 --> 30:03.994
What's that?

30:04.080 --> 30:05.434
Not from around here,
I'm guessing.

30:05.520 --> 30:09.150
Yeah, yeah.
From the city, I think.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.755
Said they were going to...
Where was it again?

30:11.840 --> 30:13.911
Mexico? Yeah.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.351
Had some questions
about vacation insurance.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.557
So, uh, speaking
of insurance...

30:20.640 --> 30:23.474
Now, look, I talked
to Bill, so if this is
about the case...

30:23.560 --> 30:26.200
Oh, no, just looking
for a little advice.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.476
With Vern dead,
and I know we're
not talking specifics,

30:28.560 --> 30:30.199
but with him dying,
I got to thinking.

30:30.280 --> 30:35.071
You know,
I'm a single person,
but I got my dad and stuff.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.753
So I got to thinking,
what would happen
to him, then.

30:36.840 --> 30:37.956
Yeah?
Yeah.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.398
No, yeah. Very...

30:42.480 --> 30:44.437
Because a lot of
girls your age,

30:44.520 --> 30:46.352
they don't think
about these things.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.194
You know the...
posthumous and so on.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.556
So, I thought
I'd come see you,
you know.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.960
Maybe buy a policy.
Oh!

30:53.080 --> 30:54.673
And I got all my
info here, you know.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.752
Social Security
and the likes.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.513
Oh, jeez. So sorry.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.829
You need some
help with that?

30:59.960 --> 31:01.030
No, I got it.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.717
Okay. Well... Uh...

31:13.440 --> 31:15.636
Okay, well... Uh...

31:17.640 --> 31:20.792
I got a lot--
You know there
are lots of choices,

31:20.880 --> 31:22.030
policy-wise.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.397
And of course
I could give you the
whole... long speech.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.550
Please, I got time.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.040
Well, I could give you
the whole long speech,

31:28.120 --> 31:31.113
but, you know,
it's
all in here.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.833
All the details,
really.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.751
Oh, and I gotta
close up real soon.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.674
Okay.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.634
Thank you for your time.
That's okay.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.310
Uh...

31:49.840 --> 31:52.719
Look over all that stuff
and give me a call.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.636
Bye.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.838
He killed my goddamn dog.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.958
You said you
were gonna find him.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.474
He raised his price.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.835
$1 million?

32:56.920 --> 32:59.389
He killed my
damn dog and now
he wants $1 million?

32:59.480 --> 33:01.631
Eat a turd
is my response!

33:01.720 --> 33:03.393
And if it's your ex-wife?

33:03.480 --> 33:05.676
Son, you think
my ex-wife killed
the damn dog?

33:05.760 --> 33:07.956
It wasn't the wife,
ass-hat!

33:08.040 --> 33:09.918
She's mean, but she's got
a human heart in her chest.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.992
Hell, she loved
the damn animal
more than me.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.230
No, this is different.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.870
Some sick bastard gets off
on hurting little things.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.719
Who else knows
about the money?

33:21.880 --> 33:25.317
Nobody. Nothing to know.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.160
Must be something...

33:28.240 --> 33:29.799
or he wouldn't be
blackmailing you.

33:29.880 --> 33:33.112
No, nobody knows.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.357
Nobody can know.
It's impossible.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.794
Meaning?

33:49.280 --> 33:51.158
You like that?

33:51.960 --> 33:53.633
St. Lawrence.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.594
Patron saint of hard-asses.
Burned alive by the Romans.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.518
You know what he said?

33:58.640 --> 34:02.156
"Turn me over.
I'm done on this side."

34:02.240 --> 34:04.311
That's a goddamn saint.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.278
You Greek Orthodox?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.476
Why, 'cause I'm Greek?

34:11.960 --> 34:14.475
Let's just say
God and I have a...

34:16.679 --> 34:19.717
You ever make a New
Year's resolution?

34:19.800 --> 34:23.190
Stop smoking?
Lose weight?

34:23.280 --> 34:24.760
And then...

34:28.040 --> 34:29.474
Hell, I don't know.
You're the expert.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.911
I want the damn
dog killer found.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.958
I'd like to move
onto the property
till this thing's over.

34:39.760 --> 34:42.434
He came to the house once.
He might do it again.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.958
There's an in-law
next to the garage.
Semenko will show you.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.679
But I am losing patience.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.876
Get it done.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.071
It's goddamn hot in here.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.711
You looked
through all those?

35:46.320 --> 35:47.674
What?

35:50.640 --> 35:51.630
It's just...

36:01.560 --> 36:03.438
your dad made
a mistake.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.115
I let a guy go
that I shouldn't have.

36:08.160 --> 36:11.551
And now I got to call
this other jurisdiction

36:11.640 --> 36:14.519
and tell them that, uh...

36:14.600 --> 36:18.958
'cause of me their
suspect got away.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.670
Hmm.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.438
Probably better to do it
in person, don't you think?

36:42.160 --> 36:43.355
What's this, then?

36:43.440 --> 36:44.669
Our suspect.

36:44.760 --> 36:45.876
Oh, yeah?

36:45.960 --> 36:48.111
Security camera caught him
kidnapping the naked fella.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.190
Kidnapped him naked?

36:49.280 --> 36:50.316
No, dressed.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.436
Phil McCormick.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.152
Our perp cut his clothes off
in the parking garage.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.469
No kiddin'?

36:55.560 --> 36:56.710
Yeah.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.793
So, here's the thing.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.031
I took the photo and
I showed it to Lester.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.554
Did what?
Not officially.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.915
No, I told him
I was interested

37:05.000 --> 37:06.320
in some insurance,
which is true.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.914
And then I just happened
to let him see the photo

37:08.000 --> 37:10.071
and you should've
seen his face.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.310
I mean, it's like
he saw a ghost.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.153
Lester knows
this fella all right

37:13.240 --> 37:15.436
and not from
some casual chat.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.318
Got to say,
I'm super ticked here.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.834
Yeah, okay,
but before you--

37:20.960 --> 37:22.314
I told you
don't pester the guy.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.073
I said, he's not a--

37:24.160 --> 37:25.514
And then, what do you--
I never said he was--

37:25.600 --> 37:27.637
And then what do you do?

37:27.720 --> 37:29.120
The next day even?
Yeah, but...

37:29.200 --> 37:32.238
What if he
is involved, you know?
I mean, think about it.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.515
No!

37:33.600 --> 37:36.035
The guy just lost his wife
and you're boxing his ears.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.236
Yeah, I know, but...

37:37.320 --> 37:38.436
Solve the naked guy.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.590
That's the case
I gave you.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.071
If this is your suspect,
put out an APB and
we'll get him in.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.800
Sure, but, you know,
what if he and Lester...

38:04.120 --> 38:07.192
You know what?
Just tell them the truth
and say you're sorry.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.634
That's what you
always tell me.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.790
You're a good girl.

38:09.880 --> 38:10.916
As far as you know.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.959
Just sit there, I'll be...
I'll be back.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.919
Yeah, hi, I'm, uh...

38:17.000 --> 38:19.037
I just drove over
from Duluth PD.

38:19.120 --> 38:22.397
I need to speak with someone
about Lester Nygaard.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.796
Hey, yeah, hi.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.078
I'm Deputy Solverson.
What can I do for you?

38:29.200 --> 38:30.429
Well, um...

38:34.200 --> 38:35.793
Maybe we should
talk at my desk?

38:35.880 --> 38:36.950
Yeah. Yeah.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.076
Yeah? All right.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.192
Have a seat.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.796
You want some coffee?
The guys just brewed
a pot, so...

38:48.880 --> 38:49.870
Uh...

38:49.960 --> 38:52.111
No, I... I just
got to...

38:54.600 --> 38:56.080
I'm good.
Okay.

38:58.080 --> 39:02.597
So, uh... three days back
I'm on patrol, you know,

39:02.680 --> 39:08.312
and I pull this guy over,
silver Taurus...

39:08.400 --> 39:10.517
ran a stop sign.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.910
And I...

39:15.320 --> 39:18.074
I gave him
a warning, see.

39:18.160 --> 39:22.712
But then, I don't know,
I just-- I had a feeling.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.193
What kind of feeling?

39:25.280 --> 39:26.794
A bad feeling.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.633
Real suspicious, like.

39:28.760 --> 39:32.037
So, I ran his plates
and it turns out

39:32.120 --> 39:36.160
that the car was registered
to one of your victims.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.560
What?

39:37.640 --> 39:38.790
Yeah.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.712
Lester Nygaard.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.393
Son of a--

39:44.120 --> 39:46.032
He told me his car
was in the shop so...

39:46.120 --> 39:47.156
Oh, yeah?

39:47.280 --> 39:48.316
Yeah.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.591
Well, here's the thing. Um...

39:54.240 --> 39:57.074
Lester wasn't driving.

39:57.160 --> 40:01.234
Now, I know that now
because I checked the
plate but at the time...

40:01.320 --> 40:03.437
This fella, maybe?

40:04.400 --> 40:05.595
Holy cow.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.033
Yeah.

40:08.120 --> 40:11.477
That's...
I think that's him.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.911
How did you?
Security camera...

40:15.000 --> 40:17.356
caught him over in St. Paul
kidnapping an accountant.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.635
No kidding?
Yeah.

40:20.160 --> 40:24.632
So, listen, one thing
I'm not quite clear on.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.598
You said you
only found out later

40:26.680 --> 40:29.115
that it wasn't
Lester driving.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.793
But, I mean...

40:30.880 --> 40:33.270
you checked the fella's
license and registration,
didn't you?

40:35.480 --> 40:37.199
Well...

40:41.040 --> 40:45.432
You see, I asked...

40:45.520 --> 40:51.278
but he... threatened me.

40:51.360 --> 40:54.558
And I...

40:54.680 --> 40:56.114
It's... it's--

40:56.200 --> 40:58.920
I know,
it's no excuse but--

40:59.000 --> 41:00.832
I...

41:00.920 --> 41:02.957
He's a really
dangerous looking fella

41:03.040 --> 41:06.238
and he had these
really scary, uh, eyes.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.276
And I just--

41:07.400 --> 41:08.390
Dad?

41:08.560 --> 41:09.550
Yeah?

41:09.640 --> 41:12.474
Could I get a dollar
for the vending machine?

41:12.560 --> 41:14.199
Yeah.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.633
Hold on. Yeah.

41:18.720 --> 41:22.191
Actually they...
they give us these tokens.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.996
Just put that
in the coin slot.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.560
Great. Thanks.

41:35.920 --> 41:36.956
How old?

41:37.040 --> 41:38.759
Greta? Yeah, 12.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.392
She's a real good kid.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.074
Her mom at home?

41:43.920 --> 41:45.434
No.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.991
It's just us, 10 years now.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.837
They're outta M&M's.
Ah.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.234
So, you two
drove all the way
from Duluth, huh?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.553
Yeah.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.871
Well, uh...

42:06.000 --> 42:08.674
I was gonna grab dinner.
There's a good
burger place nearby.

42:08.760 --> 42:12.276
So, you two want to join me
before you head back?

42:13.320 --> 42:16.597
Oh, no, no, no,
we don't want
to be a bother.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.200
It's no bother.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.352
We'll talk about
the guy, you know.
See what you remember.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.193
Maybe a clue drops out.

42:23.280 --> 42:25.556
It's Lou's.
Just a couple of blocks
up the street.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.758
Let me just put
an APB out on this guy
and I'll be right there.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.790
She seemed nice, huh?

42:38.880 --> 42:40.234
What?

42:40.320 --> 42:41.800
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

42:44.560 --> 42:46.119
Just you two?
No.

42:46.200 --> 42:50.114
A very pretty lady
will be joining us.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.320
Duluth PD?

42:52.400 --> 42:54.073
Yes, sir.

42:54.160 --> 42:57.392
You associated
with Ben Schmidt?
Think he's a lieutenant now.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.551
Yes, sir. He's my boss.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.034
Kind of a prick.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.076
That's the one.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.196
Yeah.

43:03.920 --> 43:07.038
Yeah, we had a deal
together once
in Sioux Falls...

43:07.120 --> 43:08.554
joint task force situation.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.950
Boy, that was a rodeo.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.680
Hey, Dad.
Hey, sweetie.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.275
I think I'm gonna need
a milkshake tonight.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.079
Better make it a double.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.595
Me, too?

43:20.680 --> 43:23.275
Uh, yeah, okay.
You gotta eat
something green.

43:23.360 --> 43:26.432
Same here and some
burgers all around.

43:26.520 --> 43:27.590
Sounds good.

43:33.160 --> 43:37.154
So... it's a bit
strange, huh?

43:38.440 --> 43:41.672
This Lester
fella never reporting
his car was stolen?

43:41.760 --> 43:45.674
It is, yeah.
Pretty sure he's mixed up
in some nasty business.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.476
So, you got
a boyfriend, then?

43:52.200 --> 43:53.190
No.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.116
Pretty girl like you?

43:57.200 --> 43:59.396
Too young
for a boyfriend.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.314
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.392
Hey, you ever
heard of a spider

44:04.480 --> 44:06.437
laying eggs in
a person's neck?

44:06.520 --> 44:07.476
What's that now?

44:07.560 --> 44:09.597
Friend of mine
said it happened
to a friend of hers.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.433
Gross.
Yeah.

44:11.520 --> 44:13.079
Said they were...

44:13.160 --> 44:17.120
He was sleeping
and all these baby
spiders just ran right out.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.516
Not sure if I want
to live in a world

44:21.600 --> 44:24.069
where something like that
can happen to a person.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.396
I put bourbon
in one of 'em.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.555
Whoever finds it
wins a prize.

44:33.640 --> 44:35.199
He's only kidding.

44:37.080 --> 44:40.073
Ooh, wait. No, I win.

44:41.240 --> 44:42.993
Burgers will
be right up.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.275
Thank you.

45:25.080 --> 45:26.150
Hey there, Lester.

45:26.240 --> 45:27.674
Hey.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.834
So, which one
makes the biggest hole?

45:44.720 --> 45:46.677
<i>And behold
the daughter of Pharaoh</i>

45:46.760 --> 45:49.355
<i>came down to wash
herself in the river.</i>

45:49.440 --> 45:51.875
<i>And her maids walked
by the river's brink.</i>

45:51.960 --> 45:54.316
<i>And when she saw
the basket in the sedges,</i>

45:54.400 --> 45:56.312
<i>she sent one of
her maids for it.</i>

45:57.840 --> 46:00.150
<i>And when it was brought,
she opened it</i>

46:00.240 --> 46:03.517
<i>and saw within
an infant crying.</i>

46:03.600 --> 46:06.274
<i>And having compassion
on it, she said,</i>

46:06.360 --> 46:09.353
<i>"This is one of the babes
of the Hebrews."</i>

46:13.560 --> 46:17.315
<i>And she adopted him for
a son and called him Moses,</i>

46:18.560 --> 46:21.917
<i>saying, "Because I took
him out of the water."</i>

46:24.360 --> 46:26.431
<i>One day, after Moses
had grown up,</i>

46:26.520 --> 46:30.355
<i>he went out among his people
and saw their affliction.</i>

46:31.520 --> 46:35.560
<i>He saw an Egyptian beating
a Hebrew, his brethren.</i>

46:36.920 --> 46:41.278
<i>Looking this way and that way,
and seeing no people,</i>

46:41.400 --> 46:46.156
<i>Moses slew the Egyptian
and hid him in the sand.</i>
