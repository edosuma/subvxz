00:07.069 --> 00:08.803
<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:08.805 --> 00:10.738
<i>I'm here
because the library claims</i>

00:10.740 --> 00:12.239
<i>to have
unearthed certain pages from</i>

00:12.241 --> 00:13.773
<i>a rare manuscript that</i>

00:13.775 --> 00:15.441
<i>I happen to be an expert on.</i>

00:15.443 --> 00:17.511
- And do they?
- If I had to wager a guess,

00:17.513 --> 00:19.078
<i>- I'd say no.
- So you have,</i>

00:19.080 --> 00:22.148
some kind of arrangement
with your husband?

00:22.150 --> 00:24.083
My husband suffers from Alzheimer's...

00:27.022 --> 00:29.088
<i>But we don't have
an arrangement, as you say.</i>

00:29.090 --> 00:31.189
<i>Half the time,
he doesn't even remember</i>

00:31.191 --> 00:33.826
<i>he has a wife, or
he thinks I'm his first wife,</i>

00:33.828 --> 00:35.327
<i>whom he loved better.</i>

00:35.329 --> 00:37.095
This has to end right now.

00:37.097 --> 00:39.264
- He's using you.
- You have no fucking idea

00:39.266 --> 00:41.000
- what you're talking about.
- Yes, I do!

00:41.002 --> 00:43.502
How many assistants do you
think he's gone through?

00:43.504 --> 00:44.870
What are you, 50?

00:44.872 --> 00:46.805
Maybe she does have some daddy issues.

00:46.807 --> 00:49.373
You know, tends to happen
when your father's a scumbag.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.875
<i>She tells me
everything, Solloway.</i>

00:50.877 --> 00:53.177
<i>I know it all...
the fucking hot tub.</i>

00:53.179 --> 00:55.613
- Dad, what the fuck?
- Shit.

00:55.615 --> 00:56.681
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:56.683 --> 00:58.282
- Dad?
- Whitney...

01:01.187 --> 01:03.955
- I know you.
- You don't know me.

01:03.957 --> 01:05.188
Ahhah, no, Noah!

01:05.190 --> 01:08.124
Aahhh.

03:22.086 --> 03:24.019
My God.

03:24.021 --> 03:26.989
What?

03:26.991 --> 03:29.357
It's morning already.

03:29.359 --> 03:31.326
Shit.

03:31.328 --> 03:33.461
We didn't sleep.

03:40.503 --> 03:42.704
I have to go.

03:42.706 --> 03:45.173
- Why?
- I have to get some sleep.

03:45.175 --> 03:48.109
Well, sleep with me.

03:48.111 --> 03:52.213
Come on, I'm exhausted, too.
We'll just sleep, nothing more.

03:57.052 --> 04:00.553
So when am I gonna see you... dinner?

04:00.555 --> 04:03.556
Sabine is coming home
tonight from university.

04:03.558 --> 04:05.358
I have to be there.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.828
Well, afterwards?

04:07.830 --> 04:09.796
She'll be suspicious.

04:09.798 --> 04:11.031
She's already annoyed at me

04:11.033 --> 04:13.032
for having stayed in America for so long.

04:13.034 --> 04:15.634
Why don't you just tell her the truth?

04:15.636 --> 04:17.369
She's 22.

04:17.370 --> 04:18.704
She worships her father.

04:18.706 --> 04:21.572
She wouldn't understand.

04:21.575 --> 04:23.843
Well, can I at least get
you a coffee before you go?

04:23.845 --> 04:25.978
Yes, please.

04:27.715 --> 04:28.847
Hello.

04:28.849 --> 04:31.015
Yeah, um...

04:31.017 --> 04:33.517
<i>deux cafes, s'il vous plait.</i>

04:33.519 --> 04:35.686
<i>Oui. Merci.</i>

04:35.688 --> 04:37.722
- You hear that?
- I did.

04:37.724 --> 04:39.157
Almost fluent.

04:39.159 --> 04:40.591
You're getting there.

04:40.593 --> 04:43.995
<i>Merde. I can't wear this.</i>

04:43.997 --> 04:47.164
- I have a big meeting today.
- With who?

04:47.166 --> 04:49.032
With the head of my department.

04:49.034 --> 04:50.367
About what?

04:50.369 --> 04:53.436
About Etienne, actually.

04:53.438 --> 04:57.040
I have to tell her that
he's not coming back.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.242
She doesn't know?

05:00.212 --> 05:02.179
A few years ago...

05:02.181 --> 05:04.413
when Etienne first started
showing significant signs

05:04.415 --> 05:06.749
of dementia,

05:06.751 --> 05:10.253
I applied for a sabbatical in his name.

05:10.255 --> 05:11.553
We didn't know what it was,

05:11.555 --> 05:12.889
and I wanted to buy him some time,

05:12.891 --> 05:15.424
so I wrote his letter,

05:15.426 --> 05:17.559
I forged his signatures,

05:17.561 --> 05:19.195
and now...

05:19.197 --> 05:20.929
it's over,

05:20.931 --> 05:22.264
and they're going to want to know

05:22.266 --> 05:24.766
when he plans to return to teaching.

05:24.768 --> 05:27.068
Are you nervous?

05:29.572 --> 05:33.308
It's going to be fine.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.811
What are you going to do today?

05:35.813 --> 05:37.077
I don't know.

05:37.079 --> 05:39.146
Write, walk around,

05:39.148 --> 05:41.248
pretend I'm Hemingway.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.316
I'm jealous.

05:42.318 --> 05:44.484
Stay with me.

05:44.486 --> 05:46.620
Come on, come on.

05:46.622 --> 05:50.090
Come on. Stay with me.

05:50.092 --> 05:52.159
Come on.

05:52.161 --> 05:55.661
Come on, you stay here,
play hooky for the day.

05:55.663 --> 05:56.896
What does "hooky" mean?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.631
Hooky is...

05:58.633 --> 06:01.000
a very complicated expression.

06:03.271 --> 06:06.605
This is fascinating. You
know who built this canal?

06:06.607 --> 06:09.008
- No.
- Napoleon.

06:09.010 --> 06:11.910
In 1802...

06:11.912 --> 06:14.179
he built it to bring
clean water to the city

06:14.181 --> 06:16.681
'cause they had an outbreak of cholera.

06:16.683 --> 06:20.052
I didn't know they knew
what caused cholera in 1802.

06:23.157 --> 06:25.490
- What?
- I'm trying to kiss you.

06:25.492 --> 06:26.992
- Here?
- Yeah.

06:26.994 --> 06:28.659
The guidebook says that
we have to kiss here.

06:28.661 --> 06:31.795
Paris is a tiny town.

06:31.797 --> 06:34.498
Juliette?

06:36.669 --> 06:38.936
Catherine.

06:45.810 --> 06:47.944
Bonjour. _.

06:47.946 --> 06:49.479
Hi. Bonjour, hi.

06:49.481 --> 06:51.514
- Bonjour.
- Hi, hello.

06:51.516 --> 06:53.049
_ - Excuse me.

06:53.051 --> 06:55.218
- You're American?
- Yeah.

06:55.220 --> 06:58.288
- Just visiting?
- Yeah, just for a little while.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.323
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

07:00.325 --> 07:02.657
<i>Merci.</i>

07:02.659 --> 07:04.526
How is Etienne?

07:04.528 --> 07:07.062
We haven't seen him for months.

07:07.064 --> 07:08.697
The rumors are that he's unwell.

07:08.699 --> 07:10.966
No, he's fine. He's just
getting older, and...

07:17.008 --> 07:19.240
- My what?
- Don't worry.

07:19.242 --> 07:21.209
I won't tell him.

07:21.211 --> 07:22.510
In fact, I'm happy for you.

07:22.512 --> 07:24.845
You deserve a little fun.

07:24.847 --> 07:26.580
You've always been so...

07:26.582 --> 07:27.882
diligent.

07:27.884 --> 07:30.018
I'm late. I should get going.

07:30.020 --> 07:32.253
I have a meeting with Celia.

07:32.255 --> 07:33.988
Well, of course.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.689
It was lovely to see you again.

07:36.691 --> 07:38.825
We're so glad you're home.

07:40.195 --> 07:42.162
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

07:42.164 --> 07:43.830
- Bye.
- Nice to see you.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.598
- Nice to see you.
- Bye.

07:48.603 --> 07:52.239
You all right?

07:52.241 --> 07:54.606
I've always hated her.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.581
I should get going.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.116
I'll see you later.

08:04.118 --> 08:05.884
Okay.

09:23.759 --> 09:25.592
Livingston...

09:51.653 --> 09:52.918
Papa?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.286
<i>Merci.</i>

11:43.458 --> 11:45.191
Papa...

12:14.654 --> 12:16.587
Shh.

14:36.187 --> 14:38.454
<i>Oui.</i>

14:42.058 --> 14:43.058
<i>Oui, bon. _</i>

21:05.820 --> 21:08.120
Hello? It's me.

21:09.523 --> 21:10.723
Etienne is sleeping.

21:10.725 --> 21:13.725
Are you still free for an early dinner?

21:40.485 --> 21:42.319
Hi.

21:47.025 --> 21:49.759
How was your day?

21:49.761 --> 21:51.560
Fine. And yours?

21:51.562 --> 21:54.396
I just... I wrote all day.

21:54.398 --> 21:55.898
I got so much done.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.600
I love it here.

21:57.602 --> 21:59.836
The bookstores are incredible.

21:59.838 --> 22:01.370
Look, I...

22:06.343 --> 22:07.375
What is it?

22:08.846 --> 22:10.078
Merry Christmas.

22:15.719 --> 22:17.619
It's not an original, but it's...

22:17.621 --> 22:19.554
It's pretty rare.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.125
Where did you find this?

22:24.127 --> 22:27.561
You know, I know a guy who knows a guy.

22:31.968 --> 22:35.569
<i>Conybeare Edition, 1868.</i>

22:42.310 --> 22:43.643
I don't know what to say.

22:43.645 --> 22:45.779
You've been...

22:45.781 --> 22:48.748
you've been so good to me.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.416
A few months ago, I was on the brink,

22:50.418 --> 22:53.552
and now, thanks to you, I'm...

22:53.554 --> 22:56.789
I'm okay.

22:59.593 --> 23:01.459
I'm sorry.

23:01.461 --> 23:03.128
<i>Merde, it's Sabine.</i>

23:03.130 --> 23:04.596
Go.

23:06.066 --> 23:08.000
<i>Oui, Mon amour.</i>

23:21.414 --> 23:22.746
Sabine?

24:53.201 --> 24:54.732
Sabine...

28:00.143 --> 28:02.109
What happened?

28:12.588 --> 28:13.887
Wait, wait...

28:24.265 --> 28:26.899
Juliette.

28:29.404 --> 28:32.305
Someone will come.

28:32.307 --> 28:34.940
No one is coming.

28:37.911 --> 28:41.279
No one is coming.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.169
God, I love it here.

29:05.171 --> 29:07.138
I could get used to Paris.

29:10.142 --> 29:11.641
What's that?

29:11.643 --> 29:13.376
This is not the real Paris.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.878
- No?
- No, this is for tourists.

29:17.115 --> 29:19.649
So you gonna show me the real Paris?

29:19.651 --> 29:21.384
I don't know if you'd be welcome there.

29:22.487 --> 29:24.154
Well, fuck the real Paris.

29:24.156 --> 29:26.122
Let's go buy some cheese.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.091
Noah, I have to go.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.129
Juliette!

29:35.866 --> 29:38.167
Isabelle...

29:45.475 --> 29:47.175
Hi, hi. Noah.

29:47.177 --> 29:48.909
- Isabelle.
- Hi.

29:48.911 --> 29:51.045
<i>- Bonjour, enchantée.
- Bonjour, enchantée.</i>

30:00.489 --> 30:03.323
No.

30:09.364 --> 30:11.598
<i>Ouais.</i>

30:18.206 --> 30:21.006
<i>C'est formidable.</i>

30:22.543 --> 30:25.411
Ciao.

30:27.548 --> 30:29.948
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:29.950 --> 30:32.117
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:33.721 --> 30:36.053
What was that about?

30:36.055 --> 30:37.988
Current affairs.

30:40.126 --> 30:41.292
Bye.

31:03.382 --> 31:05.148
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

31:25.335 --> 31:27.569
<i>All children
grow up, except one.</i>

31:27.571 --> 31:30.104
<i>- You know it?
- Of course.</i>

31:30.106 --> 31:32.039
<i>I read it to my kids.</i>

32:26.827 --> 32:28.660
What the fuck?

33:21.846 --> 33:24.179
Hey, my brother.

33:24.181 --> 33:25.380
Wh...

33:25.382 --> 33:27.415
What... what are you doing here?

33:27.417 --> 33:28.616
I'm just...

33:28.618 --> 33:30.050
I'm just in Paris for a few weeks.

33:30.052 --> 33:32.052
I saw your poster.

33:32.054 --> 33:33.954
Sorry, I-I thought that was Whitney.

33:33.956 --> 33:36.190
That? God, no.
That's... that's Elfrida.

33:36.192 --> 33:39.360
What, s... you and Whitney aren't...

33:39.362 --> 33:41.561
- Is she not here with you?
- God, yeah.

33:41.563 --> 33:44.598
No, no, no, no, she's
just running some errands.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.099
<i>There's so much to do.</i>

33:46.101 --> 33:48.935
It's a big night tonight, big opening.

33:48.937 --> 33:51.371
Then I'm on to Prague tomorrow.

33:51.373 --> 33:54.240
You know...

33:54.242 --> 33:56.643
I've been selling so many
of these prints recently.

33:56.645 --> 33:58.544
It's crazy.

33:58.546 --> 34:01.614
I guess I'm having a little bit
of a moment... at the moment.

34:01.616 --> 34:03.315
I'm just feeling really blessed.

34:03.317 --> 34:05.751
- Where are you guys staying?
- Hotel Les Bains.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.252
- You know it?
- Les Bains?

34:07.254 --> 34:09.221
- Les Bains?
- No, no.

34:09.223 --> 34:11.089
Magical. Opulent.

34:11.091 --> 34:15.060
The linens, my God.

34:15.062 --> 34:17.061
Hotel Les...

34:17.063 --> 34:18.596
- Les Bains.
- Les Bains.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.731
<i>Oui.</i>

34:19.733 --> 34:20.931
Okay, well, good luck tonight.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.300
No, no, look.

34:22.302 --> 34:24.268
You should totally come.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.438
I'm sure Whitney would love to see you.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.473
Don't worry.

34:28.475 --> 34:30.842
I'll put your name on the list.

35:03.975 --> 35:05.908
Whitney!

35:08.111 --> 35:10.211
What the fuck are you doing here?

35:10.213 --> 35:13.047
I'm in Paris for a little while.

35:13.049 --> 35:14.349
I...

35:14.351 --> 35:17.118
I saw Furkat. He told me you were here.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.187
So you just happened to be in Paris?

35:19.189 --> 35:21.990
No, no, I have a... I have a friend here.

35:21.992 --> 35:24.324
Of course you do.

35:24.326 --> 35:25.659
Excuse me.

35:25.661 --> 35:27.795
Wait. Whitney...

35:30.165 --> 35:31.966
How are you? You okay?

35:31.968 --> 35:35.469
- I'm fine.
- You don't seem fine.

35:35.471 --> 35:37.872
- Thank you.
- Wait.

35:37.874 --> 35:38.906
Why don't we get a cup of coffee?

35:38.908 --> 35:40.474
Because I'm busy.

35:40.476 --> 35:43.142
Well, I'm sure Furkat can wait 30 minutes.

35:43.144 --> 35:45.077
Okay, well, that's because
you don't know what my job is,

35:45.079 --> 35:46.713
you don't know what I'm doing here,

35:46.715 --> 35:49.048
and you've never had any
respect for me anyway, so...

35:49.050 --> 35:51.350
Okay, w-why don't we have
a conversation about that?

35:51.352 --> 35:53.753
Enjoy Paris.

36:02.195 --> 36:04.429
Hey.

36:04.431 --> 36:07.098
Yeah.

36:07.100 --> 36:10.602
I'm fine.

36:10.604 --> 36:13.705
Le Vrai Paris, okay.

36:13.707 --> 36:15.840
Yeah, I'll meet you there. Bye.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.709
- Hi.
- Hello.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.945
Sorry I'm late. I got lost.

36:55.947 --> 36:57.780
The real Paris is hard to find.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.347
Yeah, it is.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.220
What are you reading?

37:06.222 --> 37:07.789
Is it good?

37:07.791 --> 37:09.924
Not really.

37:09.926 --> 37:11.492
Who wrote it?

37:15.298 --> 37:18.499
My God. That's my first book.

37:18.501 --> 37:20.401
Where'd you get this?

37:20.403 --> 37:22.103
I have my ways.

37:22.105 --> 37:24.071
Why are you reading it?

37:24.073 --> 37:26.840
I wanted to know more of your work.

37:26.842 --> 37:28.909
You must have been very
young when you wrote it.

37:28.911 --> 37:32.012
Yeah, not that young.

37:32.014 --> 37:33.246
Can I get a drink?

37:33.248 --> 37:35.315
Here.

37:35.317 --> 37:37.684
- Thanks.
- How was your day?

37:39.821 --> 37:42.354
It was fine.

37:42.356 --> 37:43.990
Did you get good work done?

37:43.992 --> 37:46.826
- Yeah.
- Good.

37:46.828 --> 37:48.761
I had a truly crazy day.

37:48.763 --> 37:50.329
Why? What happened?

37:50.331 --> 37:51.964
Etienne woke up.

37:53.835 --> 37:55.635
H-he woke up?

37:56.970 --> 37:58.603
What does that mean?

37:58.605 --> 38:00.839
He was his old self again, actually.

38:00.841 --> 38:03.207
It was incredible.

38:03.209 --> 38:06.277
What, is he... is he still like that?

38:06.279 --> 38:09.147
I don't know. I assume so.

38:09.149 --> 38:12.951
W-what are you doing here, then?

38:12.953 --> 38:15.886
I wanted to be with you.

38:15.888 --> 38:19.389
You should go home. You should be with him.

38:19.391 --> 38:21.158
I don't want to. It makes me sad.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.193
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

38:29.501 --> 38:31.134
<i>Oui.</i>

38:33.471 --> 38:35.638
Please don't look at me like that, Noah.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.007
- Like what?
- With all that judgment.

38:38.009 --> 38:39.976
No, I'm not judging
you. I just... I just...

38:39.978 --> 38:43.913
I don't want you to wind up
doing something you regret.

38:43.915 --> 38:45.514
Okay.

38:47.652 --> 38:50.185
Listen...

38:50.187 --> 38:52.087
Juliette, I-I've been here before.

38:52.089 --> 38:54.255
You haven't.

38:54.257 --> 38:56.324
This...

38:56.326 --> 38:59.460
these things can turn quickly.

39:04.068 --> 39:07.201
Do you think you're some
kind of expert on affairs?

39:07.203 --> 39:08.903
Why?

39:08.905 --> 39:11.672
Because you wrote a book?

39:11.674 --> 39:13.507
Let me tell you something about my marriage

39:13.509 --> 39:16.376
that you don't know.

39:16.378 --> 39:19.413
Etienne made you look like an amateur.

39:19.415 --> 39:21.248
Meaning what?

39:21.250 --> 39:22.949
He didn't want to be constrained.

39:22.951 --> 39:24.918
He felt life was short

39:24.920 --> 39:27.887
and monogamy was a bourgeois conspiracy.

39:27.889 --> 39:30.289
A bourgeois conspiracy?

39:30.291 --> 39:32.025
And I went along with it.

39:32.027 --> 39:35.028
He had his affairs, and
I asked no questions.

39:35.030 --> 39:36.629
I had Sabine, I did my work,

39:36.631 --> 39:39.765
and I told myself that was enough.

39:39.767 --> 39:42.901
So I hope you'll forgive me
if on the only day of his life

39:42.903 --> 39:44.937
that he's ever wanted to stay with me

39:44.939 --> 39:46.571
and have a coffee...

39:46.573 --> 39:50.275
I choose to go out.

39:56.049 --> 39:59.117
It's your daughter.

39:59.119 --> 40:01.119
You're not gonna answer it?

40:25.010 --> 40:26.777
Everything okay?

40:29.148 --> 40:30.579
It's fine.

40:36.587 --> 40:39.822
Here, I...

40:39.824 --> 40:41.757
bought you this.

40:44.628 --> 40:46.095
What is it?

40:46.097 --> 40:49.330
Open it and see.

40:57.340 --> 40:59.540
Where did you get this?

40:59.542 --> 41:02.710
Some bookstore I stumbled across.

41:05.447 --> 41:07.380
Thank you.

41:10.619 --> 41:12.686
I have to go.

42:41.105 --> 42:42.938
Fuck you.

42:46.642 --> 42:48.776
What did you say to me?

42:48.778 --> 42:49.977
Are you kidding me?

42:49.979 --> 42:51.946
This is not the time

42:51.948 --> 42:53.580
to be talking about this right now.

42:53.582 --> 42:55.082
I know, but I've been trying
to talk to you about this

42:55.084 --> 42:56.317
since we got here, and you're never free.

42:56.319 --> 42:57.952
And why do you think that is?

42:57.954 --> 42:59.453
'Cause this has been an
enormous fucking week for me.

42:59.455 --> 43:01.188
Okay, Whitney, if you
can imagine a universe

43:01.190 --> 43:02.489
that doesn't revolve around
your little derriere...

43:02.491 --> 43:04.357
Don't do that! I'm not doing that!

43:04.359 --> 43:05.858
I set this whole thing up!

43:05.860 --> 43:06.826
<i>Look, I gave you... I gave you</i>

43:06.828 --> 43:08.128
<i>everything you wanted...</i>

43:08.130 --> 43:09.495
exposure to international artists,

43:09.497 --> 43:10.863
an experience you could parlay

43:10.865 --> 43:12.299
into an assistantship with anyone.

43:12.301 --> 43:14.467
I don't want to be an
assistant. I love you.

43:14.469 --> 43:15.969
<i>- Come on.
- I do!</i>

43:15.971 --> 43:17.437
And I think you love me.

43:17.439 --> 43:19.306
- I said that when I was...
- You said that!

43:19.308 --> 43:22.841
When we were fucking, yes,
because I like fucking you.

43:22.843 --> 43:25.844
Look, I have people inside,
guests, that I need to speak to,

43:25.846 --> 43:27.679
so if you'll please excuse me.

43:27.681 --> 43:29.348
- Don't walk away from me.
- Don't fucking touch me!

43:29.350 --> 43:30.715
Don't...

43:30.717 --> 43:32.517
- Learn your place!
- Whitney!

43:34.621 --> 43:36.621
You okay?

43:36.623 --> 43:37.822
Now wait here. Just wait there.

43:37.824 --> 43:39.357
Wait. No. What are you doing?

43:39.359 --> 43:41.125
- Fucking kill him!
- Don't make a scene!

43:41.127 --> 43:42.226
Please, Dad, don't do
that. Don't make a scene!

43:42.228 --> 43:44.028
Make a scene? He fucking hit you.

43:44.030 --> 43:45.463
Please don't make a scene.
I know. I don't care.

43:45.465 --> 43:46.630
I don't care. Please, let's go.

43:46.632 --> 43:48.132
I want to leave. I want to leave.

43:53.639 --> 43:55.572
Whitney!

43:55.574 --> 43:56.806
Whitney!

44:07.752 --> 44:11.387
So who's this friend you're here with?

44:11.389 --> 44:13.155
She's a...

44:13.157 --> 44:15.524
she's a professor,

44:15.526 --> 44:17.926
and she lives here.

44:17.928 --> 44:20.762
How long have you been seeing her?

44:20.764 --> 44:23.332
Um, a few months...

44:23.334 --> 44:24.867
maybe three.

44:27.271 --> 44:29.570
Are you in love with her?

44:29.572 --> 44:32.840
Well, I'm very fond of her.

44:32.842 --> 44:35.443
Yes, but do you love her?

44:35.445 --> 44:38.013
Let's just say I'm trying
to be a little more careful

44:38.015 --> 44:40.348
with that word right now, Whitney.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.719
Do you want to talk about
what just happened back there?

44:45.721 --> 44:47.354
No.

44:47.356 --> 44:50.190
Whitney...

44:50.192 --> 44:52.959
that was not okay, right?

44:55.597 --> 44:57.464
Whitney?

44:57.466 --> 44:58.565
You wouldn't understand.

44:58.567 --> 45:01.735
Try me.

45:01.737 --> 45:03.536
He's an artist.

45:04.872 --> 45:06.439
Okay.

45:06.441 --> 45:09.575
He can't just turn his passion on and off.

45:09.577 --> 45:11.911
You know, he brings the same intensity

45:11.913 --> 45:13.779
to his life that he does to his work,

45:13.781 --> 45:15.781
and I understand that about him.

45:15.783 --> 45:17.450
I respect that about him.

45:17.452 --> 45:19.717
Whitney...

45:19.719 --> 45:21.986
this isn't love.

45:21.988 --> 45:24.722
Love isn't supposed to be pain.

45:24.724 --> 45:28.660
Love is supposed to make you
feel wonderful about yourself,

45:28.662 --> 45:30.495
and real love does that.

45:30.497 --> 45:32.797
A real man will...

45:32.799 --> 45:36.000
make you feel safe and appreciated.

45:36.002 --> 45:37.701
Like you did for Mom?

45:43.476 --> 45:46.610
So what are you saying,
Dad? You didn't love her?

45:50.183 --> 45:51.515
Of course I loved her.

45:51.517 --> 45:53.516
Well, maybe it wasn't real love,

45:53.518 --> 45:56.352
because real love is supposed
to "make you feel wonderful,"

45:56.354 --> 45:58.854
and you made Mom feel like dog shit.

46:09.101 --> 46:11.833
And you didn't even have to watch.

46:11.835 --> 46:13.034
I mean, you just left.

46:13.036 --> 46:15.404
The person who had to watch was me.

46:23.314 --> 46:25.880
I never hit your mother.

46:25.882 --> 46:28.048
You may as well have.

46:32.788 --> 46:36.657
At least with Furkat, I know
when something's bothering him.

46:36.659 --> 46:39.827
You know, he lets it out.

46:39.829 --> 46:41.395
You think you're better than him

46:41.397 --> 46:43.231
because you swallowed
your feelings for 20 years

46:43.233 --> 46:45.132
and then left us and ruined our lives?

46:45.134 --> 46:46.500
I don't think I'm better than him.

46:46.502 --> 46:48.935
- You're not.
- I think you are.

46:51.473 --> 46:53.540
And I'm listening to you defending a man

46:53.542 --> 46:55.242
I just watched hit you,

46:55.244 --> 46:57.577
and I can tell you... you really
believe what you're saying,

46:57.579 --> 46:59.078
and that...

46:59.080 --> 47:02.314
God, that kills me, Whitney...

47:02.316 --> 47:05.151
'cause I can see I failed in
the most important job I had,

47:05.153 --> 47:08.020
which was to protect you from men like...

47:17.565 --> 47:19.797
Men like me.

47:49.528 --> 47:50.794
I have to go.

47:50.796 --> 47:52.195
You... you have to what?

47:52.197 --> 47:53.429
We're going to Prague tomorrow,

47:53.431 --> 47:54.697
and there's a lot to do, and I...

47:54.699 --> 47:56.098
Sweetheart, don't...

47:56.100 --> 47:57.433
Don't tell me what to do.

47:57.435 --> 47:58.901
I'm not telling you what to do.

47:58.903 --> 48:00.135
I'm asking you. I'm begging you, Whitney.

48:00.137 --> 48:01.704
I'm begging you.

48:01.706 --> 48:03.806
I'm not saying leave him.

48:03.808 --> 48:06.141
I'm just saying...

48:06.143 --> 48:08.644
let me help you take a break.

48:08.646 --> 48:11.279
Just hit pause, get
off the merry-go-round,

48:11.281 --> 48:14.882
and take stock of where
you are and what you want.

48:19.456 --> 48:20.988
I...

48:20.990 --> 48:22.790
I have nowhere else to stay, and I...

48:22.792 --> 48:25.159
You can... Just stay in my room.

48:25.161 --> 48:26.393
With you?

48:26.395 --> 48:28.495
I'll... I'll go somewhere else.

48:28.497 --> 48:30.163
You can stay as long as you like...

48:30.165 --> 48:32.700
a day, a week, whatever.

48:41.677 --> 48:43.576
I just want to go home.

48:54.989 --> 48:56.989
Okay, I'll take you home.

49:00.128 --> 49:02.927
What about Madame Professor?

49:02.929 --> 49:04.863
She'll understand.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.600
Just take my room tonight,

49:08.602 --> 49:10.702
and I'll get us some tickets home tomorrow.

49:10.704 --> 49:11.970
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve,

49:11.972 --> 49:13.605
and you're never gonna get a ticket...

49:13.607 --> 49:17.041
I'll manage, Whitney. I'll manage.

49:17.043 --> 49:19.042
Okay?

49:26.386 --> 49:28.085
Okay.

49:31.123 --> 49:33.223
Come on.

49:45.804 --> 49:47.737
I'm gonna go now. You get some sleep.

49:47.739 --> 49:49.673
I'm so tired.

50:02.586 --> 50:05.887
Hey, Whit...

50:05.889 --> 50:08.489
I just want to say one more thing.

50:08.491 --> 50:12.193
Being a parent is hard,

50:12.195 --> 50:16.397
and I know we haven't
done it perfectly, but...

50:16.399 --> 50:19.099
I learned from my parents' mistakes,

50:19.101 --> 50:22.670
and your mother learned from hers,

50:22.672 --> 50:25.739
just as you'll learn from our mistakes

50:25.741 --> 50:28.408
and be better with your children...

50:28.410 --> 50:30.276
until...

50:30.278 --> 50:32.178
someone, someday,

50:32.180 --> 50:35.081
many years from now, finally...

50:35.083 --> 50:37.551
has a perfect childhood.

50:46.394 --> 50:48.394
Night.

51:25.798 --> 51:29.700
I just never thought he would actually die.

51:38.910 --> 51:42.612
All those things I said
to you in the café...

51:42.614 --> 51:45.681
I was angry.

51:45.683 --> 51:47.182
I didn't mean them.

51:47.184 --> 51:48.918
I loved him.

51:48.920 --> 51:51.586
He was brilliant. He was...

51:51.588 --> 51:53.522
dynamic.

52:00.931 --> 52:03.197
All these years,

52:03.199 --> 52:06.301
I felt I was the lady in the tower...

52:06.303 --> 52:10.538
Guinevere, stuck, trapped in her castle,

52:10.540 --> 52:13.206
married to a man who was too old for me,

52:13.208 --> 52:15.643
who was off fighting his wars

52:15.645 --> 52:17.878
in his libraries,

52:17.880 --> 52:20.815
and I felt I had been cheated...

52:23.018 --> 52:25.785
of passion, of devotion...

52:27.288 --> 52:29.689
of true love,

52:29.691 --> 52:33.493
waiting for some troubadour to rescue me.

52:35.296 --> 52:38.331
But when I was alone in the room...

52:40.068 --> 52:44.002
with him, with his body...

52:44.004 --> 52:46.872
it was...

52:46.874 --> 52:49.808
I-I suddenly realized I...

52:49.810 --> 52:52.845
I just had it all wrong.

52:52.847 --> 52:54.680
He was the one who was trapped.

52:54.682 --> 52:57.483
He was the lady in the tower,

52:57.485 --> 53:00.250
and I was the troubadour.

53:03.656 --> 53:05.823
I am such a fool.

53:05.825 --> 53:08.158
No, you're not.

53:13.933 --> 53:16.199
I abandoned him when he was helpless.

53:20.672 --> 53:23.673
I was angry.

53:23.675 --> 53:26.843
I was... I was angry, so
I left him to die alone.

53:26.845 --> 53:29.212
Juliette, don't do this
to yourself, please.

53:33.417 --> 53:37.386
Looking after someone
who's dying is... is hard.

53:40.391 --> 53:44.359
Etienne's nurses got to go home
every night to their families,

53:44.361 --> 53:46.128
and even Sabine,

53:46.130 --> 53:47.396
she would go out with her friends

53:47.398 --> 53:49.264
and go back to her own apartment,

53:49.266 --> 53:51.733
but for you, this...

53:51.735 --> 53:54.201
this was your life.

53:57.240 --> 53:59.273
After someone dies,

53:59.275 --> 54:01.876
I think we want a...

54:01.878 --> 54:05.613
tell ourselves a story

54:05.615 --> 54:07.848
of how it was our fault...

54:10.653 --> 54:15.255
because at least that
gives us some control.

54:18.393 --> 54:20.928
I prayed for him to die, Noah.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.867
I'm sure you did...

54:29.938 --> 54:32.404
but that's not why he's dead.

55:01.801 --> 55:04.367
- Find it okay?
- Yeah.

55:05.705 --> 55:08.271
Juliette, this is my daughter Whitney.

55:08.273 --> 55:09.873
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

55:09.875 --> 55:11.775
Sabine, this is Whitney. This is Sabine.

55:11.777 --> 55:13.210
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

55:13.212 --> 55:15.945
<i>Merci.</i>

55:26.557 --> 55:30.159
I'm sorry about not being here for you.

55:30.161 --> 55:33.495
Your daughter needs you,
and my daughter needs me.

55:36.834 --> 55:38.566
Bye.

55:45.142 --> 55:46.241
Bye.

55:46.243 --> 55:48.010
Bye.

55:53.016 --> 55:55.382
Bonjour.

56:53.439 --> 56:56.373
Hey, are you coming in?

56:58.944 --> 57:01.377
It's probably not a good idea,

57:01.379 --> 57:03.213
but I'll call you tomorrow for Christmas.

57:03.215 --> 57:05.381
Okay.

57:05.383 --> 57:07.918
Hey, Whit...

57:10.089 --> 57:11.487
I love you.

57:14.726 --> 57:16.258
Thanks, Dad.

57:38.348 --> 57:40.448
Hey, Dad...

57:40.450 --> 57:42.150
Hey, Martin.

57:42.152 --> 57:44.485
I'm taking Trevor and
Stacey tomorrow to Central Park.

57:44.487 --> 57:46.687
We're going sledding.

57:46.689 --> 57:49.757
Do you want to come?

57:49.759 --> 57:51.959
Yeah.

57:51.961 --> 57:53.293
Yeah, I'd love to.

57:53.295 --> 57:55.195
Meet us at Poet's Walk at two?

57:55.197 --> 57:57.430
Okay, two. Perfect.

58:25.525 --> 58:27.959
Where we going, buddy?

58:39.708 --> 58:44.708
