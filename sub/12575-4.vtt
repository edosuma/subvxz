What do you say we tee off together?

00:18.485 --> 00:20.214
<i>Sure thing, Willie.</i>

00:27.927 --> 00:29.656
BOTH: Dead solid perfect.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.937
I've always wanted to sell propane...

00:41.007 --> 00:43.134
and propane accessories, like you do.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.837
I guess this dang music thing came up.

00:46.146 --> 00:49.513
Well, ain't no changing the past, I guess.
Let's jam.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.763
<i>Son, have you lost your mind?</i>

01:46.840 --> 01:49.707
Aren't you supposed to knock first?
I could've been naked.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.971
Bobby, how many times have I told you?

01:52.045 --> 01:54.104
Betsy is not a toy.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.706
<i>She's a 1963 Guild solid-top...</i>

01:58.251 --> 01:59.240
<i>[Sniffing]</i>

01:59.586 --> 02:00.976
What's that smell?
You been playing this with your feet?

02:00.986 --> 02:02.886
What's that smell?
You been playing this with your feet?

02:02.988 --> 02:04.717
That's cheese, Dad.

02:05.523 --> 02:08.720
Why would there ever be cheese on Betsy?

02:08.994 --> 02:11.428
It's funny. It's a comedy routine.

02:11.496 --> 02:14.693
You know, you play the guitar
with a piece of cheese and you go:

02:14.766 --> 02:17.792
"Hey, look at me. I'm Eddie Cheddar!"

02:17.869 --> 02:18.858
[Bobby chuckling]

02:19.304 --> 02:23.206
- You know, it's from Celery Head.
- What is a Celery Head?

02:23.341 --> 02:26.435
He's the world's best comedian.
He glues things!

02:26.644 --> 02:30.102
Like he glues a Kleenex box
to a tennis shoe and goes:

02:30.682 --> 02:33.651
"This is in case you have a runny nose."

02:33.752 --> 02:37.347
That's not a joke, son.
That's a waste of good glue.

02:37.622 --> 02:40.420
Well, he makes $3 million a year.

02:40.592 --> 02:42.321
You must've got that wrong.

02:42.394 --> 02:45.488
People don't pay money
to see things like that.

02:45.663 --> 02:49.099
Now, Robert Klein,
that's something you pay money for.

02:49.934 --> 02:53.529
- [Yawning] What is going on in there?
- I'm worried about our boy.

02:53.605 --> 02:57.735
<i>Some green-haired freak
told him to rub cheese on my guitar.</i>

02:57.942 --> 03:01.969
<i>You mean Celery Head.
I saw him on Entertainment Tonight.</i>

03:02.514 --> 03:04.641
PEGGY: He makes $3 million a year.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.239
<i>[Sighs]</i>

03:06.651 --> 03:09.677
Luanne, good Lord! Put on some pants!

03:09.754 --> 03:10.778
I'm wearing shorts.

03:10.889 --> 03:11.913
<i>[Screams]</i>

03:11.990 --> 03:13.981
Don't scare me like that!

03:16.027 --> 03:19.019
Look at this, Peggy.
The boy chipped Betsy's bridge.

03:19.164 --> 03:22.691
And he woke me up from my Willie Nelson
golfing dream, number three.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.759
Calm down. It is just a bunch of wood
and some wires.

03:25.837 --> 03:29.603
Wood and wires?
I've had Betsy since high school.

03:29.774 --> 03:33.175
I took her to the prom. I love this guitar.

03:33.244 --> 03:37.010
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you understand what love means?</i>

03:37.082 --> 03:39.175
Yes. I love my family.

03:39.317 --> 03:43.617
Yeah. Now you're getting it.
That's the kind of love I have for Betsy.

03:44.355 --> 03:47.791
- I'm going back to sleep. You coming?
- I'm already up.

03:47.859 --> 03:50.760
Besides, I wouldn't want to make
Betsy jealous.

03:50.829 --> 03:53.923
HANK: Luanne, would you please
not sit like that?

03:54.566 --> 03:56.193
[Making engine sounds]

03:56.267 --> 03:59.236
"I sell propane and propane accessories.

04:06.744 --> 04:07.733
[Crash]

04:07.846 --> 04:10.371
Willie, no. That's a one-way street.

04:10.448 --> 04:11.574
[Horn blaring]

04:11.716 --> 04:15.174
HANK: What happened to my truck?
BOBBY: Your mower hit it.

04:15.253 --> 04:19.849
Maybe I ought to send my mower
to one of those children's psychologists.

04:20.757 --> 04:22.019
[Grunting]

04:22.093 --> 04:25.859
LUANNE: Are you mad about something?
PEGGY: Mad? Why would I be mad?

04:25.930 --> 04:30.697
Just because Hank pays more attention
to that silly guitar than he does to me?

04:30.768 --> 04:31.962
<i>[Screaming]</i>

04:32.270 --> 04:33.669
Lay off the gas.

04:33.738 --> 04:36.468
If I break another nail,
I'll fail my manicure final.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.736
Are you having trouble
at the beauty academy?

04:38.810 --> 04:39.834
No.

04:40.578 --> 04:42.739
I'm also failing braid work.

04:42.981 --> 04:46.314
Braid work does not come natural
to the women in our family, honey.

04:46.384 --> 04:48.784
You know it, I know it,
and the whole town knows it.

04:48.853 --> 04:49.842
[Horn blaring]

04:49.921 --> 04:51.980
<i>Sounds like your horn's going off!</i>

04:52.056 --> 04:54.024
HANK: You really think so, Bill?

04:54.092 --> 04:55.354
Oh, yeah.

04:55.827 --> 04:56.816
Damn it, Hank!

04:56.895 --> 05:00.831
You know I can't have loud,
sudden noises while I'm meditating!

05:01.032 --> 05:04.263
I was a nose hair away
from attaining inner peace!

05:04.969 --> 05:05.958
<i>Shut up!</i>

05:06.037 --> 05:07.026
[Horn stops]

05:07.138 --> 05:09.402
Don't even try to take credit for that.

05:09.474 --> 05:13.535
It was not done by me.
It was done through me.

05:14.179 --> 05:15.203
[Metallic clank]

05:15.280 --> 05:17.544
What is that chinging noise?

05:17.916 --> 05:19.747
One of those stealth helicopters...

05:19.817 --> 05:22.945
with computerized
noise-cancellation capability.

05:24.022 --> 05:26.081
They're still working the chings out.

05:26.157 --> 05:28.489
How did you know
about the stealth helicopters?

05:28.560 --> 05:31.654
Alt. Conspiracy. Black. Helicopters.

05:32.096 --> 05:35.725
I tell you what. That Internet, man.
You just go in there, point and click.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.893
Get in and talk about ww. W com.

05:37.969 --> 05:40.096
Mean, you got them
naked chicks on there.

05:40.171 --> 05:42.901
You go click, click, click.
It's real easy, man.

05:46.377 --> 05:48.277
HANK: Bobby, give me that club!

05:48.346 --> 05:50.940
<i>Son, maybe I'm not
getting through to you.</i>

05:51.015 --> 05:52.277
Let me explain.

05:52.350 --> 05:55.148
You got to respect other people's things.

05:55.353 --> 05:59.312
You do not use a man's pitching wedge
to hit clumps of mud.

05:59.557 --> 06:02.185
It's not mud, Dad. It's dog doo.

06:04.128 --> 06:05.720
HANK: That boy ain't right.

06:05.797 --> 06:06.855
[Hollering]

06:06.931 --> 06:09.399
Excellent workout!
I got my rotator cuff rotating.

06:09.467 --> 06:11.230
My face feels weird.

06:12.337 --> 06:14.168
- Carlos!
- Carlos?

06:14.305 --> 06:16.273
You name your things, I'll name mine.

06:16.341 --> 06:20.209
What about that thing named Bobby?
What are we gonna do about him?

06:20.278 --> 06:23.475
He seems bent on destroying
everything I own.

06:23.648 --> 06:26.708
Why can't he turn that energy
into something useful?

06:26.784 --> 06:30.151
Like that boy with no legs
who ran across Canada.

06:30.221 --> 06:33.281
Maybe you need to spend
some time together, just talking.

06:33.358 --> 06:35.622
<i>You and Bobby. Mano a mano.</i>

06:35.727 --> 06:38.924
- I can't now, I'm going golfing.
- Take him with you.

06:38.997 --> 06:41.522
We're riding a full 18 holes today.

06:41.866 --> 06:44.767
You know what that kind of stress
can do to a boy?

06:46.738 --> 06:49.764
Bobby, I apologize for yelling at you.

06:49.841 --> 06:52.469
But sometimes, you just don't listen.

06:52.677 --> 06:56.044
It's like you got a problem
with concentration.

06:57.782 --> 06:58.976
Bobby?

06:59.117 --> 07:00.277
Bobby!

07:00.351 --> 07:01.545
Bobby!

07:02.086 --> 07:04.145
Hey! You just killed me!

07:04.255 --> 07:06.018
You needed killing.

07:06.124 --> 07:08.024
I've been thinking, son...

07:08.092 --> 07:10.856
and I realized, you don't have any goals.

07:11.362 --> 07:14.763
You've got to figure out
what you want to do with your life.

07:14.832 --> 07:17.027
<i>Okay. Can we go to Six Flags?</i>

07:17.402 --> 07:18.391
<i>[Sighs]</i>

07:18.670 --> 07:21.002
I think you need a role model.

07:21.139 --> 07:23.664
<i>Someone to emulate. A hero.</i>

07:24.108 --> 07:26.668
<i>Someone besides that Broccoli Neck.</i>

07:27.412 --> 07:31.007
<i>How about Eddie Stillson?
Can I emulate him?</i>

07:31.149 --> 07:34.482
<i>Now, there you go. Eddie Stillson.
Which one's he?</i>

07:34.552 --> 07:37.919
Is he the space shuttle astronaut
or the stock car champ?

07:37.989 --> 07:40.787
<i>He got to the end of Level 6
in Scream Ninja.</i>

07:40.858 --> 07:45.727
Bobby, when I say "hero,"
I don't mean some weird Game Boy freak.

07:46.097 --> 07:49.931
If you don't watch it, you're gonna end up
like Jason Adderly's boy.

07:50.702 --> 07:52.727
Deal me out this hand, Jason.

07:53.071 --> 07:54.766
<i>I'm about to bust.</i>

07:55.073 --> 07:58.600
<i>Sorry, I thought, this was the bathroom.
Oh, good Lord!</i>

07:58.676 --> 08:00.109
[Panting]

08:01.212 --> 08:02.941
You know Howard Adderly?

08:03.014 --> 08:05.915
<i>He's my number-two hero,
after Eddie Stillson.</i>

08:06.617 --> 08:09.586
Bobby, you need
to be lectured all afternoon.

08:09.887 --> 08:12.822
Peggy, I'm taking the boy golfing,
and that's that.

08:19.263 --> 08:20.287
[Grunting]

08:20.365 --> 08:23.425
Careful now, Peggy.
Betsy isn't strapped in yet.

08:23.501 --> 08:26.868
Do not tell me
you're taking that thing golfing with you.

08:26.938 --> 08:30.396
Don't be silly, Peg.
Just bringing her in to get fixed.

08:30.742 --> 08:34.803
<i>Sit in the middle, son. I want to make sure
Betsy's in front of the airbag.</i>

08:36.179 --> 08:38.977
<i>HANK: So, Bobby, we've got
to think of a hero for you.</i>

08:39.049 --> 08:43.316
- Do you have a hero, Dad?
- I sure do. And it's Willie Nelson.

08:43.587 --> 08:44.612
How come?

08:45.156 --> 08:47.954
You might say he's been my inspiration.

08:48.559 --> 08:51.960
<i>See, Willie grew up in Texas,
and I grew up in Texas.</i>

08:52.463 --> 08:54.897
He loves golfing and playing guitar.

08:54.966 --> 08:57.400
I love golfing and playing guitar.

08:57.468 --> 08:59.902
<i>He's had trouble with the IRS.</i>

09:00.071 --> 09:04.872
And I must have spent six hours last April
on that 1040 form.

09:05.443 --> 09:06.967
"EZ," my ass.

09:07.612 --> 09:09.881
Do you have a hero like that?

09:11.249 --> 09:12.739
Willie Nelson?

09:13.818 --> 09:17.652
You're just saying Willie Nelson
because I said Willie Nelson.

09:17.722 --> 09:19.747
No, I like Willie Nelson.

09:19.824 --> 09:22.452
He's got long hair. He's Alternative.

09:22.526 --> 09:24.153
Now, you take that back.

09:24.228 --> 09:27.061
I followed that man
from Country Western...

09:27.131 --> 09:29.622
to Country, to Adult Contemporary...

09:29.700 --> 09:31.998
and that's as far as I'm going.

09:32.069 --> 09:34.367
Here, son. Take a look at that.

09:34.472 --> 09:37.873
<i>That's Willie Nelson's
own personal golf course.</i>

09:41.012 --> 09:44.539
LUANNE: I am going to show
that braiding machine who's boss.

09:44.682 --> 09:48.118
<i>Go on, Luanne. Show this town
there's a braider in the family.</i>

09:50.187 --> 09:54.146
I'm not scared of you.
This time I'll beat you at your own game.

10:01.098 --> 10:02.588
Miss Kremzer!

10:03.601 --> 10:05.068
<i>Someone!</i>

10:05.736 --> 10:07.260
<i>HANK: It's the bridge, isn't it?</i>

10:07.338 --> 10:11.331
The bridge is the symptom.
Thread asymmetry is the disease.

10:11.809 --> 10:12.935
<i>[Sniffing]</i>

10:13.210 --> 10:15.508
<i>Smells like bellybutton.</i>

10:15.613 --> 10:18.343
My son was playing it
with a piece of cheese.

10:18.449 --> 10:20.474
You mean, like Celery Head?

10:21.319 --> 10:23.446
"Look, I'm Camembert Humperdinck."

10:23.521 --> 10:24.510
Les.

10:24.622 --> 10:27.614
Go in the back and
alphabetize the guitar strings.

10:27.692 --> 10:30.217
- Alphabetize by letter, or...
- Les.

10:30.728 --> 10:32.093
- Okay.
- All right.

10:32.163 --> 10:34.893
Cheese or not,
this is a sweet, sweet guitar.

10:35.166 --> 10:38.602
- Is she for sale?
- Not hardly. Just fix the bridge, Earl.

10:38.669 --> 10:40.330
<i>[Sighing] I didn't think so.</i>

10:40.604 --> 10:44.938
Most guys would sell their wives
before they'd sell a guitar like this.

10:45.876 --> 10:47.969
I got to remember that one.

10:48.112 --> 10:50.137
Heck, I got a million of them, like:

10:50.214 --> 10:51.943
"Women are a lot like a guitar.

10:52.016 --> 10:54.610
"They both come with strings attached."

10:58.322 --> 11:00.119
Actually, those are the only two.

11:00.191 --> 11:02.216
Most women would
be threatened by Betsy.

11:02.293 --> 11:03.885
But not me, I don't care.

11:03.961 --> 11:06.020
I'd like to see that guitar come home...

11:06.097 --> 11:09.464
and chicken-fry a steak
after substitute-teaching all day.

11:11.135 --> 11:13.296
Why, thank you, Mrs. Hillman.

11:19.043 --> 11:21.773
<i>BILL: Santy Claus.
HANK: What are you talking about?</i>

11:21.879 --> 11:24.370
<i>Santy Claus. He could be the boy's hero.</i>

11:24.482 --> 11:28.748
In one 24-hour period, he delivers
toys and joy to every child on Earth.

11:28.853 --> 11:30.980
<i>Santa Claus is for babies!</i>

11:31.422 --> 11:33.617
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

11:34.658 --> 11:35.647
[Grunting]

11:36.627 --> 11:37.719
[Groaning]

11:38.763 --> 11:41.527
Damn Russian titanium alloy.

11:48.039 --> 11:49.700
[Birds chirping]

11:53.244 --> 11:54.575
[Bill clearing throat]

11:56.447 --> 11:57.471
<i>[Sighs]</i>

11:57.548 --> 12:01.279
Maybe it's just first-hole jitters.
Got any tips, Boomhauer?

12:01.419 --> 12:04.980
[Muttering] I'll tell you what you do.
You just keep that arm straight.

12:05.056 --> 12:08.219
You put your left hand still, man.
Just speed it the hell up.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.419
HANK: Let's roll. Come on, Bobby.

You are, if you get me some smokes.

13:01.212 --> 13:02.304
Okay.

13:04.148 --> 13:07.606
That's okay, Bobby. You can do it.
Just choke up on it.

Oh, my Lord, are you okay?

13:36.881 --> 13:39.315
- Am I bleeding from the ears?
- No.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.975
I must be okay, then.

13:42.286 --> 13:45.380
Oh, Mr. Nelson, I am so sorry!

My boy is new to golfing. Oh, gosh!

I'm your biggest fan.
I go to every concert I can.

14:20.157 --> 14:23.285
I also play golf. But you already know that.

14:24.261 --> 14:28.459
But you probably don't know,
you're my hero.

14:28.832 --> 14:30.459
He took our cart.

14:30.534 --> 14:32.798
- Was he bleeding from the ears?
- No.

14:32.870 --> 14:36.033
- He must be okay, then.
- You don't understand.

14:36.240 --> 14:40.267
A man only gets a chance to meet
Willie Nelson once in his life.

14:40.377 --> 14:42.504
It's supposed to be special.

14:42.580 --> 14:46.573
We meet on the golf course.
He compliments my perfect swing.

14:54.024 --> 14:56.117
How's that going to happen now?

14:56.193 --> 14:59.185
It's my fault
for ever taking the boy with me.

14:59.396 --> 15:01.125
I said I was sorry.

Try letting it go
just below the mark on your drive.

Hey, I know you.
You're the kid that rakes my lawn.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.747
No, I'm the kid who hit you in the head.

15:55.819 --> 15:57.946
- With a rake?
- No, with a golf club.

15:58.022 --> 16:01.126

Bobby's never stalked anyone before,

I mean, he shouldn't be stalking anybody.

Hey, Hank.
Bobby's been telling me all about you.

ran into my truck with the mower...

you can do with a guitar...

20:19.884 --> 20:22.011
that doesn't involve cheese.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.919
This is a song I wrote a long time ago.
