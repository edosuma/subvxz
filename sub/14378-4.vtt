00:44.483 --> 00:48.333
Now class, don't forget,
tomorrow is career day--

00:48.366 --> 00:51.050
that's where each of you
brings in a working parent

00:51.083 --> 00:55.100
to share a little bit about
their occupation with the
class.

00:55.133 --> 00:58.183
Cool! My dad's
a pro golfer.

00:58.216 --> 01:00.100
My mom's a marine.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.433
My daddy's
a brain surgeon.

01:02.466 --> 01:04.066
So's mine.

01:04.100 --> 01:07.083
What's your dad do,
Dexter?

01:07.116 --> 01:10.433
Hmmm. I never
really thought
about that before.

01:10.466 --> 01:15.016
Don't you
even know what
your dad's career is?

01:15.050 --> 01:16.166
Of course I do.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.066
Well,
if you must know,

01:18.100 --> 01:19.266
he's a top secret
scientist

01:19.300 --> 01:21.000
who works for
the government.

01:21.033 --> 01:24.200
A top secret scientist?
Really?

01:24.233 --> 01:25.283
That's cool, Dex.

01:25.316 --> 01:27.283
What type of science
is it?

01:27.316 --> 01:30.250
Um, a, his field
is a...

01:30.283 --> 01:32.133
Cosmotronic
engineering?

01:32.166 --> 01:34.016
Oh, that rules!

01:34.050 --> 01:36.450
What is cosmotronic
engineering?

01:36.483 --> 01:39.050
Is it top secret?

01:39.083 --> 01:40.200
Come on,
you could tell me.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.466
Well, I cannot tell you
the details,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.400
but it's stuff like
space travel,

01:44.433 --> 01:47.133
Teleportation,
robots and such.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.300
I can't wait
to meet him.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.366
He sounds so cool!

01:49.400 --> 01:53.000
Yeah. He is way cooler
than any of your dads.

01:53.033 --> 01:55.316
All I have to do is program
the genetic material

01:55.350 --> 01:58.416
to produce the human traits
of a super-genius dad.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.066
Ok, now.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.216
That should finish it.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.316
By morning, this massive
organic tissue

02:03.350 --> 02:06.150
should morph into
the perfect father.

02:06.183 --> 02:09.066
Good night, dad.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.166
Now to see
how this guy came out.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.250
[Gasps] He's perfect!

02:22.283 --> 02:24.033
Perfect!

02:24.066 --> 02:28.000
This father is surely
every boy's dream.

02:28.033 --> 02:31.183
Begin drain procedure...

02:31.216 --> 02:33.450
And lift tube.

02:33.483 --> 02:37.066
Go ahead,
say something cool.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.116
The coefficient
of pie

02:38.150 --> 02:41.433
times x to the third
is 3.5100987.

02:41.466 --> 02:45.100
Yes! They are
going to love you.

02:45.133 --> 02:48.233
You will be the
greatest dad ever!

02:49.050 --> 02:51.150
Ok. Get down
and be quiet.

02:51.183 --> 02:54.150
We got to get past dad.

02:58.433 --> 03:00.250
Dad: Dexter?

03:00.283 --> 03:01.466
Good morning, son.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.433
Say, that's an
awfully big backpack

03:04.466 --> 03:06.000
you have there.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.000
Uh, what?

03:07.033 --> 03:11.100
Oh, yeah. Uh,
what's a matter, pops,

03:11.133 --> 03:12.116
getting old?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.300
Oversized backpacks
are the coolest.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.283
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

03:16.316 --> 03:17.350
I forgot.

03:17.383 --> 03:20.433
Well, dad, do not want
to be late for school.

03:20.466 --> 03:24.016
I can drive you,
if you like.

03:24.050 --> 03:26.116
That's ok.

03:26.150 --> 03:27.333
Dexter?

03:27.366 --> 03:28.400
Yes?

03:28.433 --> 03:32.250
Are you sure you're
not forgetting anything?

03:32.283 --> 03:35.316
I am sure.

03:40.283 --> 03:41.466
Teacher: Ok, now, Mikey,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.100
let's meet your dad.

03:44.133 --> 03:45.066
Hey, everybody,

03:45.100 --> 03:47.116
my dad owns
a toy store in town.

03:47.150 --> 03:48.350
That's right, kids,

03:48.383 --> 03:52.333
and you know what
the best thing about
owning a toy store is?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.150
All: What?

03:54.183 --> 03:56.100
Free toys!

03:56.133 --> 03:59.033
All: Yeah!

03:59.433 --> 04:02.316
Wow. The competition
is pretty tough,

04:02.350 --> 04:04.433
but my dad will
still be the best.

04:04.466 --> 04:08.450
All right, Dexter,
it's your turn.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.133
Class, please welcome

04:18.166 --> 04:23.100
with a healthy round
of applause, my dad.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.066
Go ahead, dad,

04:28.100 --> 04:30.083
show them
how cool you are.

04:30.116 --> 04:31.116
The coefficient
of pie

04:31.150 --> 04:35.250
times x to the third
is 3.5100987.

04:35.283 --> 04:38.116
Wasn't that cool?

04:39.133 --> 04:40.150
Say it again.

04:40.183 --> 04:41.250
The coefficient
of pie

04:41.283 --> 04:46.216
times x to the third
is 3.5100987.

04:49.116 --> 04:52.183
I can't believe Dexter
forgot about career day.

04:52.216 --> 04:55.433
Good thing I got this reminder
in the mail yesterday.

04:55.466 --> 04:59.183
Ah, here we go. Room 214.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.366
Oh, hey, it's already
Dexter's turn,

05:02.400 --> 05:05.183
but who's that with him?

05:05.216 --> 05:08.400
Now why would Dexter
have a stranger

05:08.433 --> 05:11.116
pretend to be me?

05:11.150 --> 05:14.083
Is he...Is he ashamed?

05:14.116 --> 05:17.266
Anyway, isn't my dad
supercool, guys?

05:17.300 --> 05:19.266
No way! He's lame!

05:19.300 --> 05:21.233
Get him out of here!

05:21.266 --> 05:24.150
[Yelling]

05:24.333 --> 05:28.133
Whoa. It's not going
so well in there.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.300
Hmm.

05:29.333 --> 05:32.433
But guys, this
is what a top secret
scientist is like.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.400
Surely he is
the coolest dad.

05:34.433 --> 05:39.216
No way! That's not
a dad, that's a dud!

05:39.250 --> 05:42.100
Dud! Dud! Dud! Dud! Dud!

05:42.133 --> 05:45.383
Dud! Dud! Dud! Dud!
Dud! Dud!

05:47.250 --> 05:48.483
[Revving engine]

[Screeching]

05:54.483 --> 05:57.350
[Revving engine]

06:06.383 --> 06:09.066
Dad, what are
you doing here?

06:09.100 --> 06:11.066
Well, son, it's career day,

06:11.100 --> 06:13.466
so I thought I would
demonstrate my career.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.083
What career is that?

06:15.116 --> 06:20.000
Well, anybody who wants
to find out can follow me.

06:20.033 --> 06:22.183
[Cheering]

06:22.216 --> 06:23.333
This way.

06:23.366 --> 06:26.050
[Cheering]

06:33.083 --> 06:37.316
Wow, Dexter,
your dad's career
is really cool!

06:37.350 --> 06:38.400
What is it?

06:38.433 --> 06:40.300
Just look.

06:40.333 --> 06:44.000
All right, folks,
let me break it down for you.

06:44.033 --> 06:46.100
Yay!

06:46.133 --> 06:48.166
First, I must ride
this motorcycle

06:48.200 --> 06:51.233
through two flaming planks
of wood with nails.

06:51.266 --> 06:53.383
One wrong move
and pfft, I get a flat.

06:53.416 --> 06:57.250
Then hitting the ramp I fly
over 4 big yellow school buses,

06:57.283 --> 06:59.300
not just empty school buses--

06:59.333 --> 07:04.000
these are filled to the brim
with wild lions and tigers!

07:04.033 --> 07:05.283
Then, I will soar over a tank

07:05.316 --> 07:10.016
containing an assortment
of the most dangerous sharks
known to man.

07:10.050 --> 07:14.250
Finally, the dreaded
ring of fire.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.283
This is highly dangerous,
folks,

07:17.316 --> 07:20.283
so leave the stuff
to the pros like me.

07:20.316 --> 07:23.466
Your dad is mega-cool
if he makes it.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.166
I hope he
makes it, then.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.033
On my Mark...

07:29.066 --> 07:31.366
Get set...

07:31.400 --> 07:34.066
Go!

07:34.383 --> 07:37.333
Yeah!

07:43.216 --> 07:46.233
[Roaring]

07:48.100 --> 07:50.283
Whoa.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.266
Oh, my.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.150
He might make it.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.216
[Revving engine]

08:07.466 --> 08:10.033
Yay!

08:10.066 --> 08:11.250
He's my dad.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.166
Yay!

08:13.200 --> 08:16.016
[Cheering]

08:20.083 --> 08:22.466
Dad, that was
so supercool.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.383
I am sorry
I did not ask you

08:24.416 --> 08:26.083
to come in today.

08:26.116 --> 08:28.350
That's ok, Dexter.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.466
You didn't know.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.266
I'm sure your kids
wouldn't want

08:31.300 --> 08:35.150
a boring scientist
as a dad, either.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.266
Well, kids, I have to be
getting back to work.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.283
Tallyho!

08:41.316 --> 08:44.033
Bye!
Bye!

08:44.066 --> 08:50.166
Wow, there goes
the greatest dad
on earth.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.183
But he's no
cosmotronic engineer.

look at that.

which is showered
in the sun's powerful rays,

13:19.133 --> 13:24.050
except when eclipsed
by the moon.

13:25.033 --> 13:29.433
For one precious moment,
totality.

13:29.466 --> 13:31.450
Wow.

13:31.483 --> 13:33.133
Enough play.

13:33.166 --> 13:36.316
Hours from now I will be
witnessing the real thing.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.066
[Beeping]

13:43.133 --> 13:45.083
Collecting important data,

13:56.066 --> 13:57.316
Weight.

13:57.350 --> 14:00.366
Wait! 300,000 pounds?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.383
Judging by the moon's
overall density,

14:02.416 --> 14:04.116
the moon should weigh
twice that.

14:04.150 --> 14:06.283
Taking into account
the moon's gravity field

14:06.316 --> 14:08.050
and its internal inertia,

14:08.083 --> 14:09.250
it just doesn't add up!

14:09.283 --> 14:13.333
Could the scientific community
overlook something so obvious?

14:13.366 --> 14:15.316
Something is not right.

14:15.350 --> 14:18.216

inside the crust of the moon.

we'll go in
and clean them out.

what hit them.

Foolish beings!

[Feedback]

19:55.233 --> 20:00.050
Ahem. I have exposed
your secret world,

20:00.083 --> 20:02.316
unraveled your evil plot,

20:02.350 --> 20:05.283
and deflected
your entire fleet.

20:05.316 --> 20:07.266
Any last words?

20:11.083 --> 20:14.333
That must be how you say,
"I give up," in martian.

20:14.366 --> 20:17.316
Robo, translate the groveling.

20:19.216 --> 20:22.250
Martian: Why are you
doing this to us?

20:22.283 --> 20:25.000
We come in peace.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.133
Oh, no you don't.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.383
I was at your rally
to destroy earth.

20:28.416 --> 20:31.266
Does, "sneak in
and wipe them out"

20:31.300 --> 20:32.316
ring a bell?

20:32.350 --> 20:34.050
We were just waiting
for the earth's

20:34.083 --> 20:37.366
wonderful mock turtleneck
sweaters to go on sale.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.233
It's very chilly in the moon

20:39.266 --> 20:42.383
and we needed some
warmer clothing.

20:42.416 --> 20:44.083
And with the lunar eclipse,

20:44.116 --> 20:47.216
we figured the stores
wouldn't be very crowded.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.266
Mock-neck sweaters?

20:50.300 --> 20:52.333
Ha ha ha ha.

20:52.366 --> 20:55.133
Whoopsie.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.333
Would you like it
in sunburst or mint?
