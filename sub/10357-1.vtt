02:32.505 --> 02:35.974
This is the only photograph
I own from my childhood.

02:35.975 --> 02:39.079
It was taken in 1955,
when I was 8 years old,

02:39.080 --> 02:41.847
by my father
with a borrowed camera,

02:42.183 --> 02:44.384
and it's the only thing
I have left from those days...

02:44.385 --> 02:46.218
Except for my memories.

02:49.724 --> 02:51.424
This is a true story.

02:51.443 --> 02:53.543
This really happened to me.

02:59.618 --> 03:00.918
By 1962,

03:01.287 --> 03:02.854
I was 15 years old.

03:03.389 --> 03:05.023
I had 2 brothers and 3 sisters,

03:05.024 --> 03:06.657
no father, no money.

03:07.661 --> 03:09.095
I was the man of the house,

03:09.096 --> 03:10.863
and my mother, well...

03:11.699 --> 03:13.466
She was one of a kind.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.547
Christ!
You out of your mind?

03:27.683 --> 03:29.718
What's the matter
with you, asshole?

03:29.719 --> 03:31.419
All right, all right.

03:33.323 --> 03:36.692
What's the matter with you?

03:36.693 --> 03:38.194
Mr. Owens to the
office immediately!

03:38.195 --> 03:39.495
Mist... aah!

03:41.498 --> 03:44.268
Fucking asshole!
You clean it up yourself!

03:44.269 --> 03:46.036
He's the one that started it!

03:46.037 --> 03:47.337
So did you!

03:47.438 --> 03:49.671
- Come on.
- Back off! Back off!

03:50.074 --> 03:51.574
He grabbed my ass!

03:51.643 --> 03:52.943
OK, come on!

04:06.393 --> 04:08.994
Oh, come on,
this wasn't my fault!

04:08.995 --> 04:10.362
Owens scared me!

04:11.399 --> 04:13.466
Look, I really need
this job, Mr. Nardin.

04:13.467 --> 04:15.268
You can't do this!
I got kids! Come on!

04:15.269 --> 04:16.569
You're fired.

04:16.769 --> 04:19.536
- I'm begging you, pl...
- you're fired!

04:40.197 --> 04:41.965
I told you,
I'm going to get money.

04:41.966 --> 04:43.499
I don't have the money now, OK.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.368
You'll get the money later.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.735
I'll have all the money for you.

04:46.736 --> 04:48.103
Get off my back.

04:48.473 --> 04:50.373
Just lay off me on this,

04:50.541 --> 04:52.076
or you won't get nothing, OK?

04:52.077 --> 04:53.710
Just get off my back.

04:53.711 --> 04:55.679
I'm going to get
the money for you.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.713
You'll get the money, man!

04:59.384 --> 05:00.684
Hi, kids.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.303
Hi, mama.

05:02.304 --> 05:03.604
Hi, mom.

05:04.273 --> 05:08.143
Faye, how about letting your
old ma sit in her chair?

05:08.144 --> 05:10.145
I don't feel so good, mama.

05:10.146 --> 05:11.913
No? How was the movie?

05:12.082 --> 05:13.649
Well, it was scary.

05:13.683 --> 05:15.585
Flying saucers and monsters.

05:15.586 --> 05:16.886
Annie cried.

05:17.321 --> 05:18.955
- Did not!
- Did too!

05:18.956 --> 05:19.956
Did not!

05:20.690 --> 05:21.157
Did too!

05:21.358 --> 05:21.857
Did not!

05:22.058 --> 05:22.625
Did too!

05:23.026 --> 05:24.026
- Did not!
- Did too!

05:24.027 --> 05:24.527
Did not!

05:24.761 --> 05:25.930
You two, pipe down.

05:25.931 --> 05:27.131
Did not, did not!

05:27.132 --> 05:28.132
Did too.

05:28.333 --> 05:29.633
Look, mama.

05:30.368 --> 05:31.668
Oh, isn't that pretty?

05:31.669 --> 05:33.036
Isn't that mine?

05:33.305 --> 05:34.605
I don't know.

05:35.674 --> 05:38.441
Where'd you guys
get all this candy?

05:38.877 --> 05:40.979
I just gave you enough
money to go to the movies.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.013
You took your own popcorn.

05:43.617 --> 05:44.917
Lynn?

05:45.385 --> 05:46.685
I don't know.

05:47.321 --> 05:48.621
Faye?

05:48.822 --> 05:50.122
It wasn't me.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.090
Murray.

06:00.268 --> 06:01.835
Pipe down, you two.

06:02.204 --> 06:04.237
You're giving me an ulcer.

06:06.174 --> 06:08.209
Mrs. Lacey?
Your husband home?

06:08.210 --> 06:10.545
No he's not.
What's the beef this time?

06:10.546 --> 06:12.347
- Mama, I was just...
- You shut up.

06:12.348 --> 06:14.383
We had a complain from
the phone company.

06:14.384 --> 06:16.918
Your kid had a string of
their coin returns plugged.

06:16.919 --> 06:20.456
That's what you collared him for?
Penny ante crap?

06:20.457 --> 06:23.176
There's real crime,
and you're busting kids

06:23.177 --> 06:25.445
for boosting nickels from the
goddamn phone company?

06:25.446 --> 06:27.281
- Tell 'em, ma.
- You, pipe down.

06:27.482 --> 06:28.949
I've had a rotten day,

06:29.073 --> 06:30.251
a really rotten day,

06:30.252 --> 06:32.692
and wouldn't be in the mood for this,
if it came with flowers.

06:32.716 --> 06:34.555
You keeping him
or throwing him back?

06:34.556 --> 06:36.291
He ain't worth the paperwork.

06:36.292 --> 06:38.059
Just take this as a warning

06:38.060 --> 06:39.895
and keep your Dillinger
off the street.

06:39.896 --> 06:41.763
Watch the name calling
and get out.

06:41.764 --> 06:43.531
I take care of my own.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.568
Do that, lady, 'cause next time

06:46.569 --> 06:49.336
we might not be
in such a good mood.

06:50.174 --> 06:53.276
So the shoeshine business
has been good lately, huh?

06:53.277 --> 06:54.917
Been doing real good
on tips, you told me.

06:54.941 --> 06:56.212
Well, I did get...

06:56.213 --> 06:57.713
who did you lie to?

06:57.714 --> 06:59.014
Your mother.

07:02.687 --> 07:04.720
Go get your father's belt.

07:11.697 --> 07:12.997
That night,

07:12.999 --> 07:15.032
my mother made a decision.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.837
She didn't bother asking us
what we wanted to do.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.138
She never did.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.874
And once mama made up her mind,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.908
there was no stopping her.

07:29.467 --> 07:30.767
I'm thirsty.

07:35.006 --> 07:37.642
Tomorrow morning we're moving
out of this toilet of a city.

07:37.643 --> 07:38.943
Huh?

07:39.245 --> 07:40.545
Don't "huh" me.

07:42.414 --> 07:44.548
We're going to find
a decent town to live in

07:44.549 --> 07:47.119
and a proper home,
a house of our own.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.420
That's that.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.292
I ain't leaving. I ain't
leaving the neighborhood.

07:53.293 --> 07:55.128
One more "ain't,"
I soap out that mouth.

07:55.129 --> 07:57.496
You're going.
We're all going.

07:59.533 --> 08:01.566
I ain't...
I'm not going.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.037
We're leaving this city.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.875
I don't have the chance
of an ice cube in a frying pan

08:07.876 --> 08:11.109
of making things better
as long as we stay.

08:12.715 --> 08:14.216
I'm sick of moving around.

08:14.217 --> 08:15.517
That's too bad.

08:16.019 --> 08:17.920
You're the man of the house.

08:17.921 --> 08:20.455
Have you forgotten
the promise you made me?

08:20.456 --> 08:22.826
You swore you'd help me with
your brothers and sisters,

08:22.827 --> 08:25.394
that I could
always count on you.

08:25.395 --> 08:27.162
You gave me your word.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.101
Yeah.

08:32.904 --> 08:34.804
I know it won't be easy,

08:34.889 --> 08:37.789
but I can't do it
without you, Shayne.

08:38.491 --> 08:40.058
Now get some sleep.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.138
I'll make you a promise.

08:52.408 --> 08:53.809
You do this for me,

08:53.810 --> 08:55.910
and we'll never move again.

08:56.396 --> 08:57.696
Promise.

09:06.324 --> 09:07.624
So we left L.A.

09:07.858 --> 09:09.760
We sold everything we could.

09:09.761 --> 09:11.721
What we couldn't sell or
fit into our '48 Plymouth

09:11.745 --> 09:13.045
we gave away.

09:13.699 --> 09:16.139
When most families take a trip,
they know where they're going.

09:16.163 --> 09:17.163
Not us.

09:17.202 --> 09:19.137
Mama just pointed the car,

09:19.138 --> 09:20.539
sort of north and sort of east,

09:20.540 --> 09:21.973
and away we went.

09:22.442 --> 09:25.243
Ma, would you tell Murray
and Annie to quit it?

09:25.244 --> 09:26.811
Would you two stop?

09:27.147 --> 09:28.514
- Haaa!
- Mama!

09:29.133 --> 09:30.900
Nobody gets the bunny.

09:35.489 --> 09:36.922
I did not, Craig!

09:37.192 --> 09:37.925
Yes, you did!

09:37.926 --> 09:38.993
Did not!

09:38.994 --> 09:40.294
Did too!

09:40.429 --> 09:42.129
Mama, I
have to pee-pee.

09:42.130 --> 09:43.430
You just did!

09:43.882 --> 09:46.049
If you kids don't stop this,

09:46.285 --> 09:49.037
I'm going to leave you
by the side of the road!

09:49.038 --> 09:51.139
Annie, you just went.
Pipe down.

09:51.140 --> 09:52.640
- Did not!
- Did too.

09:54.077 --> 09:55.611
Pipe down, you two!

09:55.612 --> 09:56.912
Did not!

09:57.014 --> 09:58.514
- Did not!
- Did too.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.984
I'm going to come back there.

10:00.985 --> 10:03.818
You don't want me
to come back there.

10:04.689 --> 10:06.522
Jimmy Johnson, K.I.F.I.

10:06.624 --> 10:08.924
Shayne, leave it for a second.

10:09.060 --> 10:12.129
I'd like to hear just one
song all the way through.

10:12.130 --> 10:13.430
Sorry.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.067
It's my turn up front.

10:16.202 --> 10:17.769
- It is not!
- Is too!

10:18.570 --> 10:20.470
Now don't you two start.

10:20.689 --> 10:22.122
Murray, sit down.

10:23.310 --> 10:24.610
You stink bug.

10:24.978 --> 10:26.045
Is too.

10:26.046 --> 10:27.346
Is not!

10:27.381 --> 10:28.681
Pipe down!

10:30.650 --> 10:32.250
Shayne, how'd you like
to take the wheel?

10:32.274 --> 10:33.419
Sure.

10:33.554 --> 10:34.921
Scoot over here.

10:41.295 --> 10:42.595
Thanks.

10:43.365 --> 10:44.665
Hey...

10:45.167 --> 10:46.484
How about that place?

10:46.485 --> 10:48.585
It looks like a nice place.

10:48.654 --> 10:49.954
Nope.

10:50.189 --> 10:51.590
I want some orange punch.

10:51.591 --> 10:52.891
Why not?

10:53.760 --> 10:55.727
It ain't the right place.

10:55.812 --> 10:57.846
Then, what is the right place?

10:57.847 --> 10:59.481
I'll know it when I see it.

10:59.482 --> 11:00.782
See...

11:02.453 --> 11:04.454
We'll be driving down this road,

11:04.455 --> 11:07.822
and there's going to be
trees on either side.

11:07.892 --> 11:10.227
And we'll go around the curve...

11:10.228 --> 11:11.795
And there it'll be,

11:12.163 --> 11:13.930
a perfect little town.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.533
Then a little further
on will be our house.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.339
Everything will be
buttoned up and beautiful.

11:24.743 --> 11:26.176
Lynn?
Oh, honey.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.479
Are you all right?

11:28.882 --> 11:30.782
Give her
some kool-aid.

11:32.052 --> 11:33.719
Murray did it.
Murray did it.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.153
Don't spit in it.

11:35.389 --> 11:37.056
Shut up, you little fink.

11:37.057 --> 11:38.957
Cut it out.
Cut it out!

11:42.029 --> 11:44.129
Booger eater, booger eater.

11:46.702 --> 11:49.370
Murray, it better not have
come out of your nose.

11:49.371 --> 11:50.671
See it!

11:50.773 --> 11:51.606
Look at that house.

11:51.607 --> 11:52.907
Yeah.

11:53.909 --> 11:56.429
Mama said we would
find us a house this time,

11:56.430 --> 11:59.997
not an apartment,
but a real house, all our own.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.434
We saw lots of possibilities.

12:01.435 --> 12:02.868
Right there. See?

12:04.304 --> 12:05.604
See that deer?

12:06.174 --> 12:09.309
Look at that. Look at all
that space right there!

12:09.310 --> 12:11.077
Perfect for our house.

12:11.112 --> 12:12.412
I want a pony.

12:13.464 --> 12:15.299
Since we were dead broke,

12:15.300 --> 12:17.800
one question kept nagging at me.

12:17.936 --> 12:20.103
Even if we did
find our dream house,

12:20.104 --> 12:22.137
what could we buy it with?

12:22.273 --> 12:24.040
I wish we lived there.

12:49.054 --> 12:50.487
Hurry up, Murray.

12:50.822 --> 12:52.122
Look out!

12:52.125 --> 12:53.425
We've got you.

12:53.926 --> 12:55.226
Take that!

13:00.332 --> 13:02.699
I can patch your radiator here,

13:02.870 --> 13:05.770
but your water pump's gone.
It's shot.

13:06.390 --> 13:09.058
These belts look like they're
about ready to give way.

13:09.059 --> 13:11.428
And there's maybe one
tire in the whole bunch

13:11.429 --> 13:15.129
that'll see you more than
100 yards down the road.

13:33.336 --> 13:34.903
Will this cover it?

13:36.606 --> 13:38.906
Oh, ma'am.
Your wedding ring?

13:39.610 --> 13:41.327
I don't want to take it.

13:41.328 --> 13:43.028
Don't worry about it.

13:43.397 --> 13:46.132
Goddamn vagabond, Irish
Catholic son of a bitch.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.135
Never gave me anything
but grief and kids.

13:48.136 --> 13:50.369
I'm not sentimental about it.

13:52.057 --> 13:55.090
Is it worth enough
to keep my car going?

13:56.277 --> 13:59.710
Lady, this car's worth
more dead than alive...

13:59.816 --> 14:01.916
But I'll do the best I can.

14:05.604 --> 14:08.007
Everyday, for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner,

14:08.008 --> 14:10.175
we ate egg salad sandwiches.

14:10.377 --> 14:13.010
I haven't eaten one since...
Ever.

14:34.103 --> 14:35.604
We drove through 3 states,

14:35.605 --> 14:37.105
one after another.

14:37.407 --> 14:38.974
By the time we reached Idaho,

14:38.975 --> 14:40.808
we'd reached our limits

14:40.811 --> 14:43.145
physically, mentally,
and mechanically.

14:43.146 --> 14:45.748
- Mine!
- Mine!

14:46.117 --> 14:47.550
It's your turn...

14:47.985 --> 14:49.285
I'm not on you!

14:49.454 --> 14:50.754
Shut up!

14:51.255 --> 14:52.622
- Mine!
- Mine!

14:52.690 --> 14:54.457
- Shut up.
- Shut up!

14:55.694 --> 14:56.828
There, I broke one of...

14:56.829 --> 14:58.129
Can it!

15:01.600 --> 15:02.900
What is it?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.236
At first,

15:04.804 --> 15:06.805
I thought
we were out of gas again.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.239
But there it was.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.809
I'm not sure what it was,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.730
but mama had
that look in her eye.

15:13.731 --> 15:16.898
Wherever we were going,
we'd just arrived.

16:27.229 --> 16:28.529
Oh!

16:28.897 --> 16:30.530
Mama, you scared me.

16:34.519 --> 16:35.819
Hey, ma,

16:35.922 --> 16:37.222
come up here.

16:37.556 --> 16:38.440
You can see everything.

16:38.441 --> 16:40.809
Hey, mama.

16:43.046 --> 16:44.079
All right.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.649
All right, ok, good.

16:45.650 --> 16:47.184
All right, I got it.

16:47.185 --> 16:48.685
Mom, come up here.

16:48.952 --> 16:50.252
Lynn...

16:50.454 --> 16:52.354
Lynn, no, no, no!
Wait.

16:54.059 --> 16:56.826
Murray, come on.
Let's get this guy.

16:57.829 --> 16:59.129
Lacey tribe,

16:59.998 --> 17:01.298
come on.

17:17.651 --> 17:20.069
Hello?

17:22.373 --> 17:23.840
The berries are all done.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.008
No more till next year.

17:25.009 --> 17:26.309
All done.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.512
All done.

17:28.746 --> 17:30.113
We don't want any berries.

17:30.114 --> 17:31.747
I want some berries.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.286
Do you know
who owns that property

17:35.287 --> 17:37.138
across the road from you,

17:37.139 --> 17:40.239
the one with the
tumble-down house on it?

17:41.811 --> 17:43.644
Well...
I'm the owner.

17:45.849 --> 17:47.282
I want to buy it.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.742
My name's Frances Lacey.

17:55.743 --> 17:57.110
That's my tribe.

17:59.114 --> 18:01.315
I'd introduce you to
them one at a time,

18:01.316 --> 18:04.283
but life is short
and time is precious.

18:09.592 --> 18:11.892
I don't know if it's for sale.

18:16.132 --> 18:17.565
I want to buy it.

18:18.735 --> 18:21.437
I want it so bad that I'm in
no position to negotiate.

18:21.438 --> 18:23.198
You can take full advantage.
Name your price.

18:23.222 --> 18:24.522
You rich?

18:25.542 --> 18:27.211
I don't have a pot to piss in

18:27.212 --> 18:29.579
or a window to throw it out of.

18:53.190 --> 18:54.757
I have to pee-pee.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.237
If that's the case,

19:07.340 --> 19:10.240
how do you expect
to pay for the land?

19:10.309 --> 19:11.609
Well, Mr. Moon,

19:12.010 --> 19:14.177
I've learned that the dollar

19:14.214 --> 19:16.574
isn't the only way to get things
done in this great country.

19:16.598 --> 19:17.898
Let's talk.

19:27.061 --> 19:28.561
You live alone,
Mr. Moon?

19:28.562 --> 19:30.697
Yes, if it's any
of your business.

19:30.698 --> 19:32.798
Well, here's what we'll do.

19:32.935 --> 19:34.135
We'll wash your dishes,

19:34.136 --> 19:35.503
do your laundry.

19:36.171 --> 19:38.804
Dishes daily.
Laundry once a week.

19:39.708 --> 19:41.941
Clean your house once a week.

19:42.712 --> 19:45.547
My oldest son will give you eight
hours of chores each week,

19:45.548 --> 19:48.581
plus any other work
you may need on call

19:48.584 --> 19:51.084
at minimum wage plus 10 percent.

19:51.588 --> 19:53.221
You pay me interest?

19:55.292 --> 19:57.193
Mr. Moon, this
is slave labor.

19:57.194 --> 19:58.894
Take advantage of it.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.934
You know something?

20:05.804 --> 20:09.106
I'm not so sure if I want
a smart lady like you

20:09.107 --> 20:11.940
with a bunch of kids
for my neighbor.

20:15.731 --> 20:17.031
Yeah, but...

20:17.900 --> 20:19.467
Look at this place.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.103
Takes a lot of work.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.491
How do I know

20:27.127 --> 20:30.027
you won't just
up and run off someday?

20:30.732 --> 20:32.365
Well, if I did that,

20:32.901 --> 20:35.635
then you'd have all that free
labor plus your land back.

20:35.636 --> 20:37.588
But I'm telling you,
Mr. Moon,

20:37.589 --> 20:39.556
if you sell me that land,

20:39.824 --> 20:42.326
I'm building me and my kids a
house we ain't ever leaving,

20:42.327 --> 20:45.294
at least not while
I'm still breathing.

20:49.802 --> 20:52.171
So mama talked herself
into 3 acres of land

20:52.172 --> 20:54.339
with a half-finished
shack on it,

20:54.340 --> 20:57.440
and we kind of took over
Mr. Moon's life.

20:57.711 --> 21:00.113
Mama negotiated
2 days of free repairs

21:00.114 --> 21:02.414
that ended up lasting 2 weeks.

21:02.550 --> 21:04.650
He never knew what hit him.

21:04.885 --> 21:06.353
We had a lot of work to do.

21:06.354 --> 21:08.122
It was already getting cold.

21:08.123 --> 21:10.524
We had to get
a roof on and walls up...

21:10.525 --> 21:14.092
if you call canvas tarp
a "roof" and old boards,

21:18.952 --> 21:20.585
bye-bye, tumbleweed.

21:47.699 --> 21:48.999
Pull over.

21:49.368 --> 21:50.668
Pull it.

21:53.073 --> 21:54.506
Over. Over. Over.

21:57.644 --> 21:58.878
Turn which way?

21:58.879 --> 22:00.179
This way!

22:00.180 --> 22:02.615
Ok.

22:02.901 --> 22:04.001
Hurry, here it comes.

22:04.002 --> 22:05.302
Here it comes!

22:10.308 --> 22:11.608
Aah!

22:13.512 --> 22:14.612
I'm going to get you!

22:14.613 --> 22:15.913
Aah!

22:15.948 --> 22:17.248
Aah!

22:17.449 --> 22:18.749
Wait up, pals.

22:18.817 --> 22:20.117
Come on!

22:29.864 --> 22:31.164
Here, Faye.

22:46.848 --> 22:48.148
Yay! Yay! Yay!

22:48.785 --> 22:50.085
- Yes!
- Yeah!

22:51.604 --> 22:54.704
Mama traded our tires
for some furniture.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.577
Mr. Moon wanted the name of
the guy who bought them.

22:57.578 --> 23:02.011
He said he wanted proof that he
wasn't the only fool in town.

23:11.276 --> 23:12.609
So what do you know how to do?

23:12.610 --> 23:13.910
I work.

23:14.746 --> 23:17.313
I've done it all my life.
I work.

23:17.783 --> 23:20.883
I learn fast, and I
do my share and more.

23:21.287 --> 23:23.187
Yeah, well, I do need
another waitress.

23:23.188 --> 23:24.621
Then you got one.

23:32.165 --> 23:33.465
Minimum wage.

23:33.767 --> 23:35.302
Your tips are your own,

23:35.303 --> 23:37.270
and they ain't
much in this town.

23:37.271 --> 23:39.304
I'll manage.
I always do.

23:39.407 --> 23:40.774
I'll bet you do.

23:42.943 --> 23:45.012
This here's Norman, my manager.

23:45.013 --> 23:47.113
You'll be working under me.

23:47.949 --> 23:49.849
I'll be working for you.

23:54.924 --> 23:56.224
Frances.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.860
Frances.

24:03.918 --> 24:05.885
I tried to get any job I could.

24:05.886 --> 24:07.453
I wasn't particular

24:07.555 --> 24:09.722
as long as I could make money.

24:09.723 --> 24:12.023
I finally got work at a dairy.

24:14.028 --> 24:15.395
I don't know
who hated it more...

24:15.396 --> 24:16.696
me or the cows.

24:20.134 --> 24:22.471
This dumb blanket won't stay up.

24:22.472 --> 24:24.039
I already got some.

24:28.911 --> 24:30.611
Give me a hand, Lynn.

24:34.084 --> 24:36.184
Hey, hey,
Mr. Moon's here!

24:38.121 --> 24:39.421
Thanks.

24:41.058 --> 24:43.293
What are you up to,
Mr. Moon?

24:43.294 --> 24:44.495
You see...

24:44.496 --> 24:45.796
I had all this

24:46.263 --> 24:47.830
spare window glass.

24:58.327 --> 25:01.694
A man with a greenhouse
keeps plenty on hand.

25:02.549 --> 25:04.516
I used some of your wood.

25:07.788 --> 25:09.088
Glazed windows.

25:11.058 --> 25:13.625
And now I'm ready
to put them in.

25:18.066 --> 25:21.966
I don't have the money to
pay you for this, Mr. Moon.

25:22.404 --> 25:23.704
Well...

25:25.374 --> 25:26.874
I'm not doing this

25:27.093 --> 25:29.193
for the money,
Mrs. Lacey.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.930
I do well enough

25:33.666 --> 25:35.099
with the nursery.

25:38.071 --> 25:40.372
Well, I want an
accounting of your time

25:40.373 --> 25:42.074
and the cost of your materials

25:42.075 --> 25:44.242
so I can give
you an I.O.U.

25:44.745 --> 25:46.346
I don't like owing anybody,

25:46.347 --> 25:48.282
but you backed me into a corner.

25:48.283 --> 25:50.583
And I'd appreciate
it a hell of a lot

25:50.584 --> 25:54.551
if you'd let me know next
time you decide to help out.

26:20.284 --> 26:21.584
Come on.

26:22.337 --> 26:24.338
Mama had promised
I'd do Mr. Moon's chores,

26:24.339 --> 26:25.974
so I didn't have much choice.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.309
But running his tractor was fun,

26:28.310 --> 26:30.943
and that's how
I learned to drive.

26:44.495 --> 26:45.595
Hi.

26:45.596 --> 26:46.896
Hello.

26:48.666 --> 26:50.699
How does that look, Craig?

26:52.270 --> 26:53.570
Pretty good.

27:00.246 --> 27:02.080
Let's sleep on the roof.

27:02.081 --> 27:03.348
I want that room.

27:03.349 --> 27:05.516
You can't sleep on the roof!

27:05.551 --> 27:07.819
Mom, can I have my own bathroom?

27:07.820 --> 27:09.722
Can I have a pink
princess phone?

27:09.723 --> 27:12.223
Mom, can I have my own bathroom?

27:12.726 --> 27:14.426
School was coming up,

27:14.561 --> 27:16.696
so when the hand-me-downs
wore out,

27:16.697 --> 27:18.999
the church basement
was our department store.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.400
This wasn't so bad.

27:20.401 --> 27:21.968
It was all we knew.

27:35.034 --> 27:36.934
Lynn, what do you think?

27:38.104 --> 27:39.404
It's beautiful.

27:39.572 --> 27:41.072
You should get it.

27:41.141 --> 27:42.441
Mama.

27:42.842 --> 27:44.142
Oh, no, honey.

27:44.277 --> 27:45.577
Annie.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.000
Lacey tribe.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.103
We need galoshes for winter.

27:54.873 --> 27:55.473
You've never seen winter,
have you, Annie?

27:55.474 --> 27:56.774
No.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.609
Help her pick out a pair, Lynn.

28:00.579 --> 28:01.879
Craig.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.418
Here. Try this on.

28:07.454 --> 28:08.754
Mom, look!

28:11.123 --> 28:12.490
Good day, ma'am.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.726
Uh, I'm Father Tomlin.

28:15.730 --> 28:17.831
I think you may be new
to our little town.

28:17.832 --> 28:19.465
Mom, look what I found.

28:19.466 --> 28:21.601
Hope that we'll see you
at Sunday mass soon.

28:21.602 --> 28:23.235
Try again, liberace.

28:24.873 --> 28:26.673
Unless, of course,
your convictions

28:26.674 --> 28:28.542
take you to another church.

28:28.543 --> 28:31.445
Actually, we Laceys
are nondenominational.

28:31.446 --> 28:33.581
Well, that's neither here
nor there at the moment,

28:33.582 --> 28:35.283
but perhaps I could tell you

28:35.284 --> 28:38.051
about our program
to help the needy.

28:38.287 --> 28:40.520
We can provide without charge

28:40.556 --> 28:42.992
an allotment of clothing for
each member of the family...

28:42.993 --> 28:45.128
Murray, we didn't come here
looking for toys.

28:45.129 --> 28:48.096
Come back here
and try on this sweater.

28:48.632 --> 28:51.368
Uh, in addition to the clothing
items, basic food items...

28:51.369 --> 28:52.669
mama, look!

28:53.437 --> 28:54.737
Lynn, no.

28:58.076 --> 29:00.443
Uh, basic food items and so on,

29:01.346 --> 29:02.847
all without obligation,

29:02.848 --> 29:04.582
religious or otherwise.

29:04.583 --> 29:07.950
Well, thanks very much,
mister, uh... Father,

29:08.254 --> 29:10.355
but we Laceys
don't accept charity.

29:10.356 --> 29:11.923
We pay our own way.

29:12.392 --> 29:13.692
Well, uh,

29:14.394 --> 29:16.894
if... if you
change your mind...

29:23.037 --> 29:24.337
Lynn.

29:28.576 --> 29:30.845
Do me a favor. Take
this back, will you?

29:30.846 --> 29:32.213
But it'll look so nice on you.

29:32.214 --> 29:33.514
Take it back.

29:37.787 --> 29:39.354
The really bad part

29:39.856 --> 29:43.556
was when mama decided
to make our clothes herself.

29:52.919 --> 29:55.555
Hey, Lacey, where'd you get
the howdy doody dresses?

29:55.556 --> 29:57.157
They're not howdy doody.

29:57.158 --> 29:58.658
My mama made them.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.061
Where'd she get the material?

30:01.062 --> 30:03.464
Did somebody shoot a
sofa and skin it?

30:03.465 --> 30:05.232
"Howdy doody dresses"

30:05.651 --> 30:07.418
"howdy doody dresses"

30:48.765 --> 30:51.366
Murray still didn't seem
to fit into our world,

30:51.367 --> 30:52.800
but then one day,

30:52.903 --> 30:54.803
he found one of his own.

30:55.305 --> 30:56.605
Stop the bus!

30:56.790 --> 30:58.825
Stop the bus.
Stop the bus!

30:58.826 --> 31:00.126
Stop the bus.

31:00.461 --> 31:02.561
Get back in your seat, kid.

31:03.365 --> 31:04.665
Stop the bus,

31:04.766 --> 31:06.467
or I'll barf in your hat.

31:06.468 --> 31:07.768
Eew! Eew! Eew!

31:14.110 --> 31:15.410
I'll walk home.

32:24.737 --> 32:26.037
You lost, boy?

32:26.673 --> 32:27.973
No.

32:29.810 --> 32:31.110
No.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.679
I want some of this stuff.

32:39.187 --> 32:40.487
You got money?

32:41.356 --> 32:42.656
Mmm. No.

32:43.926 --> 32:45.493
Well, how do you expect to pay

32:45.494 --> 32:47.262
for the stuff you want?

32:47.263 --> 32:48.563
Well, mister,

32:49.365 --> 32:50.998
I've learned that...

32:51.016 --> 32:52.316
I've learned...

32:53.554 --> 32:55.955
That the greenback dollar
isn't the only way

32:55.956 --> 32:59.325
to get things done
in this here great country.

32:59.326 --> 33:00.626
Let's talk.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.591
All right, son.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.097
Let's find this stuff you want.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.998
I need help around here.

33:30.645 --> 33:31.945
Murray!

33:34.314 --> 33:35.682
What's with the wagon,

33:35.683 --> 33:37.417
and what's with the toilet?

33:37.418 --> 33:39.085
I got a job.
I earned it.

33:39.086 --> 33:40.755
Come on, give me a hand.

33:40.756 --> 33:43.223
You got a job, and
you earned a toilet?

33:43.224 --> 33:46.260
Yeah. So we don't have to
use the dumb old outhouse.

33:46.261 --> 33:47.894
I hate the outhouse.

33:49.632 --> 33:51.599
So for 3 days every week,

33:51.901 --> 33:55.103
Murray came home hauling some
new treasures from Mr. king.

33:55.104 --> 33:56.872
We never knew what to expect...

33:56.873 --> 33:58.906
French doors, a gas stove,

33:59.476 --> 34:01.811
a set of cracked China dishes...

34:01.812 --> 34:03.712
In smelly old
Mr. king,

34:03.714 --> 34:05.682
Murray found a kindred soul,

34:05.683 --> 34:07.916
a fellow connoisseur of junk.

34:12.090 --> 34:13.389
Come on.

34:13.424 --> 34:14.991
Come on what is it?

34:15.126 --> 34:17.826
What did you get
this time, Murray?

34:18.297 --> 34:19.230
Couches and everything.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.331
Wow.

34:20.331 --> 34:21.632
I'm tired.

34:26.306 --> 34:28.273
I got all sorts of stuff.

34:44.860 --> 34:46.159
Mr. Moon?

34:46.328 --> 34:47.628
Yes, miss Faye.

34:49.063 --> 34:50.563
Where's Mrs. Moon?

34:58.541 --> 34:59.841
Well...

35:01.311 --> 35:04.278
She went on a long
journey ahead of me.

35:04.882 --> 35:06.982
Why didn't you go with her?

35:09.453 --> 35:12.086
I had to wait here
for the Laceys.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.275
Every morning,
I went to work in the dark,

35:45.276 --> 35:47.695
then I had to walk
4 more Miles to school.

35:47.696 --> 35:49.663
Sometimes I'd get a ride,

35:49.665 --> 35:51.700
but more often,
I'd walk all the way.

35:51.701 --> 35:53.868
It gave me plenty
of time to think,

35:53.869 --> 35:56.236
and mostly what I thought about

35:56.538 --> 35:59.371
was how much I hated
Hankston, Idaho.

36:09.887 --> 36:10.000
Eh, Murray!
Come on up here.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.154
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
Eh, Murray!
Come on up here.

36:11.155 --> 36:12.455
Come on Murray.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:12.455 --> 36:16.728
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.728 --> 36:17.729
You ready?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:17.729 --> 36:17.730
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:17.730 --> 36:19.030
Yeah!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:19.030 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:57.556 --> 36:59.589
Murray, that's disgusting!

37:00.527 --> 37:01.827
Murray!

37:02.896 --> 37:03.795
Just get to work.

37:03.796 --> 37:05.096
I am.

37:10.905 --> 37:12.205
Aah!

37:13.742 --> 37:15.042
Murray!

37:18.446 --> 37:19.746
Murray!

37:20.498 --> 37:21.798
Murray!

37:23.302 --> 37:24.836
Murray, you all right?

37:24.837 --> 37:26.137
Huh?

37:26.405 --> 37:27.772
Murray, come on.

37:29.541 --> 37:31.641
- Come on.
- Look, Shayne!

37:31.910 --> 37:33.210
Shayne, look!

37:33.380 --> 37:34.680
Look, Shayne!

37:34.764 --> 37:36.064
Shayne, look!

37:36.099 --> 37:37.399
What?

37:43.291 --> 37:44.958
Hold on.
This is going to hurt.

37:44.959 --> 37:47.192
It's going to hurt all right.

37:56.471 --> 37:57.771
Ow!

38:01.644 --> 38:03.411
It should be all right.

38:03.412 --> 38:05.045
You'll be all right.

38:06.799 --> 38:08.499
I'm getting Mr. Moon.

38:19.081 --> 38:20.380
It's all right.

38:20.381 --> 38:21.881
Don't die, Murray.

38:26.021 --> 38:27.321
Stay here.

38:33.896 --> 38:36.231
But Mr. Moon wasn't
home to help us.

38:36.232 --> 38:38.067
He had driven mama into town.

38:38.068 --> 38:40.536
I had to carry Murray
to the hospital.

38:40.537 --> 38:42.570
He was crying all the way.

39:15.059 --> 39:16.159
What the hell happened?

39:16.160 --> 39:17.594
Get him in the truck.

39:17.595 --> 39:19.296
It's not my fault, mama.

39:19.297 --> 39:22.130
He fell on a nail,
and he's bleeding.

39:32.461 --> 39:34.696
Dr. Bartlett, you're needed
in room two.

39:34.697 --> 39:35.664
Mrs. Lacey.

39:35.665 --> 39:36.965
Yes.

39:38.401 --> 39:40.968
You have a very
lucky little boy.

39:41.671 --> 39:44.238
Another, oh,
2 centimeters or so,

39:44.441 --> 39:46.108
and that nail would've
punctured his lung.

39:46.109 --> 39:47.744
- Is he ok?
- He's fine.

39:47.745 --> 39:48.745
Can I see him?

39:48.746 --> 39:49.879
You can take him home.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.180
Oh!

39:52.083 --> 39:54.985
Just try to keep him in
bed for a couple of days

39:54.986 --> 39:57.019
and keep that wound clean.

40:02.127 --> 40:03.628
You give that to them upstairs.

40:03.629 --> 40:04.929
Thank you.

40:05.364 --> 40:06.731
Interesting kid.

40:09.602 --> 40:10.902
You're ok?

40:11.505 --> 40:13.372
I had made mama a promise.

40:13.373 --> 40:15.206
I told her I'd keep it.

40:15.526 --> 40:16.959
But I wasn't dad,

40:17.027 --> 40:19.563
and I was sick of
pretending I was.

40:19.564 --> 40:21.165
I knew that when
the house was done,

40:21.166 --> 40:22.866
I was going back
to L.A.

40:22.867 --> 40:24.868
There was more to do,
I had friends there,

40:24.869 --> 40:26.769
and it was a lot warmer.

40:54.736 --> 40:55.702
Warm it up for you?

40:55.703 --> 40:57.003
Yes.

40:58.173 --> 41:02.073
And he says, "you're not
here for the hunt, are you?"

41:02.811 --> 41:04.345
Can I get you anything else?

41:04.346 --> 41:06.281
We're out of here, Franny.

41:06.282 --> 41:08.149
How about you and your
tribe helping us out

41:08.150 --> 41:10.317
over on that remodeling job?

41:11.087 --> 41:13.207
We'd be on the job site, not
loafing around over here.

41:13.231 --> 41:14.531
Woh! Wooo!

41:15.659 --> 41:17.826
I'm short of cash this week.

41:18.462 --> 41:19.262
This will have to do for a tip.

41:19.263 --> 41:20.563
You're kidding.

41:21.932 --> 41:24.899
Dave, this means
more to me than money.

41:25.737 --> 41:27.037
Let's go.

41:33.077 --> 41:35.580
In Los Angeles,
mama worked her butt off

41:35.581 --> 41:37.948
just to get us from day to day.

41:38.117 --> 41:40.318
Now we all had to earn
enough to live on

41:40.319 --> 41:43.152
and put something away
for our house.

41:50.013 --> 41:53.082
We all worked on that house
every chance we got,

41:53.083 --> 41:55.218
but there were some things
we couldn't do,

41:55.219 --> 41:58.188
so mama hired contractors
for those jobs.

41:58.189 --> 41:59.489
God help 'em.

42:02.260 --> 42:03.560
Over here!

42:07.416 --> 42:09.684
Yeah, sure,
we can take care of it.

42:09.685 --> 42:11.052
I know you guys,

42:11.588 --> 42:14.056
you buy your goddamn
wiring and your fixtures,

42:14.057 --> 42:16.959
you mark it up 20, 50 percent,
and you soak me for it.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.727
I want an estimate
for manpower only

42:19.796 --> 42:21.798
and a list of what
material you'll need.

42:21.799 --> 42:23.333
I'll haggle for
the materials myself.

42:23.334 --> 42:24.634
Any questions?

42:24.969 --> 42:26.369
I ain't got much time.

42:26.370 --> 42:28.203
I got to get to my job.

42:28.973 --> 42:30.674
I know you think
I'm a hard-nosed bitch.

42:30.675 --> 42:31.975
Don't deny it.

42:32.244 --> 42:34.078
I am when it comes
to this house.

42:34.079 --> 42:35.913
But I also know
I'm at your mercy.

42:35.914 --> 42:37.881
Treat me honestly
like I'll treat you.

42:37.882 --> 42:39.382
I'll deal in cash,

42:39.519 --> 42:41.453
so we may have to
do this piecemeal,

42:41.454 --> 42:43.655
but there won't be
any corner cutting.

42:43.656 --> 42:45.390
I want the best for this house.
The best.

42:45.391 --> 42:46.691
Lacey tribe.

42:59.241 --> 43:01.474
Show Mr. Whitman
your hands.

43:03.278 --> 43:05.078
Every penny you spend is a penny

43:05.079 --> 43:07.449
me and these
little hands earned.

43:07.450 --> 43:10.418
Don't make those blisters
count for nothing.

43:10.419 --> 43:14.119
There. I've tried it all...
guilt, fear, and pity.

43:14.390 --> 43:16.958
You understand me now,
Mr. Whitman?

43:16.959 --> 43:19.059
You're shirt.
You're skin.

43:19.462 --> 43:21.497
Laughlin, get a haircut
or a dog license.

43:21.498 --> 43:23.398
You look like an animal.

43:25.134 --> 43:27.003
Stand up straight like a man,

43:27.004 --> 43:29.904
not like some old woman.
There you go.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.407
Lacey.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.577
Yeah?

43:35.314 --> 43:37.414
Just what the hell is that?

43:37.683 --> 43:40.784
Well, my sister's red socks
got in with the whites,

43:40.785 --> 43:42.985
and it turned the sheets and
pillowcases and the t-shirt

43:43.009 --> 43:44.309
kind of pink.

43:44.357 --> 43:45.924
Go get another one.

43:45.925 --> 43:48.758
Well sir, this is
the only one I got.

43:48.961 --> 43:50.728
What, are you kidding?

43:51.531 --> 43:54.934
Lacey, I told you at the
beginning of the term

43:54.935 --> 43:56.969
that you'd require a white
t-shirt, did I not?

43:56.970 --> 43:58.270
Yes, you did.

43:58.472 --> 44:00.172
White. Is that white?

44:01.108 --> 44:02.742
No, sir, it's a little off.

44:02.743 --> 44:04.043
A little off?

44:05.847 --> 44:08.614
I'd call that titty
pink, huh, guys?

44:09.183 --> 44:11.418
You're a shirt. You're a skin.
Let's go.

44:11.419 --> 44:12.988
Let's move it, guys.

44:12.989 --> 44:14.889
Let's go!
Lacey. Lacey.

44:19.195 --> 44:22.731
Listen, uh, why don't you just
go play with the girls?

44:22.732 --> 44:25.499
Better yet,
sit on the girls' bench.

44:28.305 --> 44:32.538
Your titty pink shirt will fit
in a lot better over there.

44:34.979 --> 44:37.946
Right over there
between the two girls.

44:43.422 --> 44:45.156
All right, guys, come on!

44:45.157 --> 44:47.024
Everybody over here.
Let's go!

44:47.025 --> 44:49.828
Shirts, you're going that way.
Skins, that way.

44:49.829 --> 44:51.929
Your grade depends on this.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.147
Her name was Raymi,

45:08.650 --> 45:10.551
and I couldn't have met her

45:10.552 --> 45:13.053
under more embarrassing
circumstances,

45:13.054 --> 45:17.021
but at last I had one good
reason to stay in Hankston.

45:22.582 --> 45:24.083
You can't take that test.

45:24.084 --> 45:25.717
You can't even read.

45:26.186 --> 45:28.219
I can read as good as you.

45:33.594 --> 45:35.996
Mom, Murray needs a compass
and protractor for school.

45:35.997 --> 45:37.630
Can't he borrow one?

45:37.933 --> 45:39.867
Mrs. Tipton said he has
to have a set of his own

45:39.868 --> 45:41.501
or she'll flunk him.

45:42.904 --> 45:45.005
I'll give you money
when you go back to school.

45:45.006 --> 45:46.306
Mama,

45:47.125 --> 45:48.625
I still feel sick.

45:50.045 --> 45:51.913
Just stay in bed, honey,
and keep warm.

45:51.914 --> 45:53.115
We'll save you something.

45:53.116 --> 45:54.416
Wait, Shayne!

45:56.886 --> 46:00.022
Mom, I need a new white
t-shirt for gym class.

46:00.023 --> 46:00.990
Damn, Shayne.
Another one?

46:00.991 --> 46:02.291
Yes.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.760
Take the potatoes and the gravy.

46:05.863 --> 46:07.430
Everybody sit down.

46:10.535 --> 46:13.235
You see, it's gotten
kind of green.

46:13.588 --> 46:16.790
Murray's green pants
got in with the whites.

46:16.791 --> 46:18.893
Green, white, red, blue.
What's the difference?

46:18.894 --> 46:20.928
What do you want, gold lami?

46:20.929 --> 46:22.962
Everybody else's is white.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.867
I got to have
a white t-shirt.

46:27.603 --> 46:30.570
Don't you tell me
what you got to have.

46:30.773 --> 46:33.543
You got to have a roof over your
head and food on the table,

46:33.544 --> 46:37.311
and you got that. You're
not getting a new t-shirt.

46:47.825 --> 46:48.959
Hi, Mr. Moon.

46:48.960 --> 46:50.260
Hi, Mr. Moon.

46:50.463 --> 46:52.147
Pumpkin.
Made them myself.

46:52.148 --> 46:53.448
Still warm.

46:53.449 --> 46:55.482
Mr. Moon,
please come in.

46:58.154 --> 47:00.723
Sit down.
Let me take your jacket.

47:00.724 --> 47:02.024
Thank you.

47:03.294 --> 47:05.394
Happy Thanksgiving, Laceys.

47:06.030 --> 47:08.263
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Moon.

47:11.502 --> 47:13.402
Faye's not feeling well.

47:17.342 --> 47:18.977
Are you a praying man,
Mr. Moon?

47:18.978 --> 47:20.878
I'm a failed Catholic...

47:21.780 --> 47:23.080
But, yes.

47:24.783 --> 47:26.351
We're not religious either,

47:26.352 --> 47:27.987
but a taste of it couldn't hurt,

47:27.988 --> 47:29.521
and who knows?
It might take

47:29.522 --> 47:31.489
on one of these heathens.

47:37.265 --> 47:40.298
Lord, we have much
to give thanks for...

47:41.285 --> 47:42.585
But this year,

47:43.221 --> 47:45.121
I have a special thanks.

47:46.858 --> 47:48.158
Thank you,

47:48.527 --> 47:50.227
for the Lacey family,

47:51.196 --> 47:53.096
which came into my life,

47:53.932 --> 47:55.899
and turned it upside-down

47:56.769 --> 47:58.069
and made...

48:01.407 --> 48:03.707
Made it much more interesting.

48:05.879 --> 48:07.179
And my house,

48:08.182 --> 48:09.482
is very clean.

48:11.352 --> 48:12.652
Amen.

48:14.356 --> 48:15.656
Amen.

48:17.091 --> 48:18.458
- Amen.
- Amen.

48:20.578 --> 48:21.878
Give it back.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.980
Busy.

48:46.190 --> 48:47.557
Can you hold it?

48:48.159 --> 48:49.459
I don't know.

48:49.761 --> 48:51.061
It's freezing.

49:21.930 --> 49:23.230
Hey.

49:24.566 --> 49:28.599
I wiped that butt a long time
before you did, you know.

49:28.738 --> 49:32.238
Next thing we're working
on is indoor plumbing.

49:50.445 --> 49:51.745
Hey, there.

49:52.013 --> 49:53.313
Hi, Norm.

49:55.083 --> 49:57.452
Uh, Dave Pollock
left this for you.

49:57.453 --> 49:58.753
Beautiful.

49:59.655 --> 50:02.422
A 4-d fuse box
in perfect condition.

50:02.725 --> 50:04.793
Don't get all hot and
bothered over a tin box.

50:04.794 --> 50:06.996
Well, we make do
with what we got.

50:06.997 --> 50:09.782
It's the best thing that's
happened to me all day.

50:09.783 --> 50:12.585
How about I take you to
Crossroads after we close?

50:12.586 --> 50:13.953
They got a band.

50:14.854 --> 50:16.757
I got to get home to my kids.

50:16.758 --> 50:18.392
Just a few minutes
kicking up your heels

50:18.393 --> 50:20.360
one night in... How long?

50:20.961 --> 50:22.061
I don't even remember.

50:22.062 --> 50:23.362
See.

50:23.765 --> 50:26.532
One drink, one dance,
straight home.

50:28.003 --> 50:29.937
I got some old
electrical conduit

50:29.938 --> 50:32.105
I'll throw into the bargain.

50:32.274 --> 50:34.610
How much conduit
we talking about?

50:34.611 --> 50:36.511
How much can you handle?

50:37.414 --> 50:41.647
Norman, if it isn't connected
to this, I ain't interested.

50:42.084 --> 50:44.451
But I will go dancing with you.

50:44.789 --> 50:47.489
One beer, one dance,
and then home.

50:49.159 --> 50:50.992
That'll be all for you?

50:59.037 --> 51:00.338
- There's mom.
- Hi, mom.

51:00.339 --> 51:01.639
Hi, mom.

51:01.708 --> 51:03.875
- Hi, mom.
- Tips were good tonight.

51:04.444 --> 51:05.944
Murray, get the jar.

51:05.945 --> 51:07.245
What's that?

51:11.084 --> 51:12.819
I saved you some supper.

51:12.820 --> 51:14.720
Oh, well, I already ate.

51:15.422 --> 51:18.455
Here's some ham
sandwiches for tomorrow.

51:19.477 --> 51:21.044
I've been thinking.

51:22.214 --> 51:24.848
This Christmas, we don't need
to get each other presents.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.884
We'll get presents
for our house.

51:26.885 --> 51:28.385
Like a television?

51:29.120 --> 51:31.222
Well, maybe not like a
great big old television.

51:31.223 --> 51:32.656
What about Santa?

51:33.058 --> 51:35.894
Well, he'll get presents
for our house, too.

51:35.895 --> 51:37.595
Can Santa bring a TV?

51:38.146 --> 51:39.779
It's too big, dummy.

51:40.650 --> 51:42.817
Shut up, Annie. I want a TV.

51:43.987 --> 51:45.487
What do you think?

51:46.022 --> 51:47.389
It's ok with me.

51:47.957 --> 51:50.590
- I like the idea.
- Fine with me.

51:51.496 --> 51:52.996
What do you think?

51:54.098 --> 51:54.931
Sure.

51:54.932 --> 51:56.232
Huh?

51:56.401 --> 51:58.101
Sure.
You were late.

51:59.204 --> 52:00.504
What?

52:01.139 --> 52:03.307
I said you were late.
Where were you?

52:03.308 --> 52:04.808
I went for a beer.

52:05.310 --> 52:06.610
Really?

52:06.645 --> 52:07.945
With Norm?

52:10.016 --> 52:11.316
Yes, with Norm.

52:23.764 --> 52:25.197
You listen to me.

52:26.067 --> 52:28.502
You leave my private life
to me, Shayne Patrick,

52:28.503 --> 52:30.470
what little I have of it.

52:33.875 --> 52:35.577
This weekend we get the tree!

52:35.578 --> 52:36.878
Yay! Yay! Yay!

52:41.884 --> 52:43.852
When you're really, really poor,

52:43.853 --> 52:45.353
everything you see

52:45.622 --> 52:47.789
is something you can't have.

52:51.161 --> 52:52.461
- Shayne?
- Yeah.

52:53.465 --> 52:55.231
What are you going to
get mama for Christmas?

52:55.232 --> 52:56.532
I don't know.

52:57.502 --> 52:59.202
Maybe some stockings.

53:02.039 --> 53:05.142
I saw her crying last night
when she ruined her last pair.

53:05.143 --> 53:09.310
I thought we were supposed to
get presents for our house.

53:09.949 --> 53:12.182
That's just talk, that's all.

53:12.418 --> 53:13.718
You sure?

53:13.887 --> 53:15.788
We wrote that letter to Santa.

53:15.789 --> 53:18.556
Yeah. You know
how mom always talks.

53:19.258 --> 53:20.618
Does that mean
I get a Bowie knife?

53:20.642 --> 53:21.942
No.

53:27.618 --> 53:29.752
Coming through.
Coming through.

53:29.753 --> 53:31.053
Step aside.

53:31.256 --> 53:32.556
Thanks.

53:35.793 --> 53:37.093
Wait, wait.

53:44.553 --> 53:46.254
When I was a kid,
we had an old bathtub.

53:46.255 --> 53:47.555
It was so big,

53:47.706 --> 53:49.542
I could lay down up to my chin.

53:49.543 --> 53:51.377
My knees would
still be underwater.

53:51.378 --> 53:52.945
I'd read for hours.

53:53.380 --> 53:55.848
The books would get all fat and
crinkly from the dampness.

53:55.849 --> 53:57.983
Did you live in
a house of your own?

53:57.984 --> 54:00.417
Yeah. Lived there
until I left.

54:01.889 --> 54:04.458
How's Santa going to come
if we don't have a chimbly?

54:04.459 --> 54:05.759
It's chimney.

54:06.861 --> 54:08.930
He'll have to come
through the keyhole,

54:08.931 --> 54:10.598
like he did in Los Angeles.

54:10.599 --> 54:12.133
- Dummy!
- You're the dummy!

54:12.134 --> 54:13.168
Dummy!
You are.

54:13.169 --> 54:14.469
No, you are.

54:17.073 --> 54:19.007
The water's getting all gunky.

54:19.008 --> 54:20.441
Look who's in it.

54:21.511 --> 54:24.278
Why am I always last
to take a bath?

54:24.414 --> 54:27.317
'Cause nobody wants to wash
after you've been in there.

54:27.318 --> 54:28.618
Well, I'm done.

54:29.753 --> 54:31.586
Not so fast, young man.

54:33.124 --> 54:34.424
Let me see those ears.

54:34.425 --> 54:35.725
I cleaned them.

54:36.695 --> 54:39.630
Oh, Murray. You could
plant potatoes in there.

54:39.631 --> 54:40.931
Ouch!

54:41.433 --> 54:44.933
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
I'm sorry, baby.

54:45.505 --> 54:49.872
You're getting to be an independent
little snot, aren't you?

54:55.966 --> 54:57.867
Hello again,
Mrs. Lacey.

54:57.868 --> 54:59.168
Every year,

54:59.302 --> 55:00.670
we pass out these presents

55:00.671 --> 55:02.372
to the needy children...

55:02.373 --> 55:04.307
needy children?
Good for you Father!

55:04.308 --> 55:07.277
I suggest you find some.
There's none here.

55:07.278 --> 55:09.880
I'm sure your children would
appreciate some gesture...

55:09.881 --> 55:12.416
my children's gifts
are already under the tree.

55:12.417 --> 55:15.184
Merry Christmas.
Good night, Father.

55:16.789 --> 55:18.890
Let's get ready for bed.
Santa's almost here.

55:18.891 --> 55:20.324
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

55:34.842 --> 55:36.809
Murray, look! Santa came!

55:37.645 --> 55:39.145
Santa drank the milk!

55:39.146 --> 55:40.579
Look! Look! Look!

55:40.681 --> 55:41.981
Santa came!

55:43.719 --> 55:45.019
Come on!

55:46.087 --> 55:48.088
- Presents!
- I saw them! No!

55:48.089 --> 55:50.224
Stop it. We have to
wake up mom first.

55:50.225 --> 55:51.525
Come on.

55:51.628 --> 55:52.928
Mom! Mom! Mom!

55:53.430 --> 55:54.730
Ok! Ok!

55:55.231 --> 55:56.531
Mom! Mom! Mom!

56:02.807 --> 56:04.107
Where's mine?

56:04.608 --> 56:07.175
Yeah, where's mine?
Where's mine?

56:07.411 --> 56:08.711
Oh! Santa came!

56:11.483 --> 56:13.050
Here. I found mine.

56:17.956 --> 56:19.256
Oh, Lynn.

56:21.060 --> 56:22.360
Thanks.

56:22.695 --> 56:24.995
I wonder why this is so heavy.

56:28.234 --> 56:29.534
Ready?

56:30.003 --> 56:31.303
One...

56:32.339 --> 56:33.639
Two...

56:33.941 --> 56:35.241
Three!

56:36.209 --> 56:37.509
Save the paper.

56:38.613 --> 56:39.913
Why?

56:44.052 --> 56:46.085
I bet I know what this is.

57:17.255 --> 57:18.555
Oh, Lynn!

57:21.593 --> 57:23.760
Did you make these yourself?

57:42.768 --> 57:44.068
What's wrong?

57:49.041 --> 57:51.275
They're presents for our house.

57:51.276 --> 57:53.576
Remember?
We talked about it.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.633
This is not a house.

58:07.477 --> 58:09.244
This is not Christmas.

58:12.717 --> 58:14.284
We live in a shack.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.020
A shack!

58:18.423 --> 58:20.523
We have nothing of our own.

58:22.444 --> 58:25.680
Everything we did have, we either
sold it or left it behind...

58:25.681 --> 58:27.048
we have nothing!

58:27.416 --> 58:29.318
It's supposed to be
Christmas, goddamn it!

58:29.319 --> 58:30.619
It's Christmas!

58:31.121 --> 58:34.354
You watch your mouth,
Shayne Patrick Lacey.

58:35.158 --> 58:37.058
Well, I like what I got.

58:40.014 --> 58:42.914
All that money we earned,
and nothing.

58:45.620 --> 58:48.122
You're mad 'cause you didn't
get a stupid t-shirt.

58:48.123 --> 58:49.490
Shut up, Murray!

58:52.928 --> 58:55.262
All they wanted was
some toys or a radio...

58:55.263 --> 58:56.563
you know what?

58:57.399 --> 59:01.903
You care more about this stupid
shack or this stupid house idea

59:01.904 --> 59:04.071
than you do about any of us!

59:10.547 --> 59:12.580
Go get your father's belt.

59:17.889 --> 59:19.189
Go get it.

59:49.474 --> 59:50.774
I'll get it.

59:54.580 --> 59:56.280
Ooh. Merry Christmas.

59:57.015 --> 59:58.448
I was going to...

01:00:03.257 --> 01:00:05.357
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Moon.

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:23.544
I know you had told me
not to bring any presents,

01:00:23.545 --> 01:00:24.845
but...

01:00:25.481 --> 01:00:27.248
This is for the house.

01:00:32.855 --> 01:00:35.555
Uh, Lynn,
get Mr. Moon his present.

01:00:37.844 --> 01:00:39.144
It's a mailbox.

01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:45.018
We got the spelling off
the contract,

01:00:45.019 --> 01:00:47.586
and Shayne made it
in shop class.

01:00:47.588 --> 01:00:48.888
Yes. Thank you.

01:00:52.727 --> 01:00:54.027
What is this?

01:00:54.162 --> 01:00:55.462
Plans.

01:00:57.266 --> 01:00:59.935
The blueprints for
the rest of this house.

01:00:59.936 --> 01:01:02.036
It's not like your picture.

01:01:02.104 --> 01:01:04.172
It's one-story ranch
with 2 bedrooms,

01:01:04.173 --> 01:01:05.874
but that can be changed.

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:07.775
It's a good, solid plan.

01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:19.238
I really appreciate it,
Mr. Moon,

01:01:20.074 --> 01:01:23.107
but we're set on
building our own house.

01:01:23.812 --> 01:01:25.179
Merry Christmas.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.487
You...

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:36.556
Are a stubborn woman,
Mrs. Lacey.

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:50.139
What's wrong in here?

01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:53.743
Santa Claus hates me.

01:02:02.672 --> 01:02:03.972
Mr. Moon...

01:02:06.475 --> 01:02:07.843
Could you give me
a ride into town?

01:02:07.844 --> 01:02:09.144
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:09.345 --> 01:02:11.378
I'll be ready in a minute.

01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:14.282
I'll be warming up the truck.

01:02:32.905 --> 01:02:34.272
Merry Christmas.

01:02:35.107 --> 01:02:37.807
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

01:02:39.611 --> 01:02:41.244
Thank you very much,

01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:43.514
and a Merry Christmas to you.

01:02:44.651 --> 01:02:46.068
Excuse me, Father.

01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:47.369
Oh, Mrs. Lacey.

01:02:47.838 --> 01:02:49.639
I certainly didn't
expect to see you here.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.473
Well, actually, Father,

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:54.477
I was hoping to take you up
on your offer.

01:02:54.478 --> 01:02:57.147
Would you have any
of those presents left?

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:58.981
Uh, I took your advice.

01:02:59.084 --> 01:03:01.851
I gave them
to a truly needy family.

01:03:02.021 --> 01:03:03.721
So you have no gifts?

01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:05.889
You know,

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:08.360
the best gift
that you could give them,

01:03:08.361 --> 01:03:11.528
would be to bring them
all here to church.

01:03:12.699 --> 01:03:14.749
Father Tomlin,
that was wonderful.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.785
Thank you. I greatly
enjoyed that sermon.

01:03:16.786 --> 01:03:18.753
I have money.
I can pay.

01:03:18.855 --> 01:03:20.656
I'm... I'm sorry,
Mrs. Lacey.

01:03:20.657 --> 01:03:23.024
We... we have none.
I'm sorry.

01:03:41.614 --> 01:03:43.714
Is it warm enough in there?

01:03:44.217 --> 01:03:45.517
Warm enough.

01:03:46.853 --> 01:03:50.353
Why didn't you finish
this place, Mr. Munimura?

01:03:50.624 --> 01:03:52.524
I started it for my boy.

01:03:53.293 --> 01:03:55.060
He went into the Navy.

01:03:55.363 --> 01:03:56.796
He was a pilot...

01:03:56.897 --> 01:03:58.197
Flew jet.

01:04:00.118 --> 01:04:03.218
Married a nice Japanese
girl from Hawaii.

01:04:04.056 --> 01:04:05.657
They were going to move here

01:04:05.658 --> 01:04:07.691
after their tour in Korea.

01:04:08.027 --> 01:04:09.460
Munimura and son.

01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:14.366
Korea...

01:04:16.336 --> 01:04:17.903
He wanted to fight.

01:04:19.406 --> 01:04:21.239
Michael wanted to prove

01:04:21.374 --> 01:04:24.007
he was as American
as anyone else.

01:04:24.579 --> 01:04:27.079
Chieko and I started this place.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:30.082
It was going to be a surprise.

01:04:31.218 --> 01:04:32.851
He didn't come back.

01:04:33.722 --> 01:04:36.089
His wife went on with her life.

01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:38.658
Chieko died the next year.

01:04:47.704 --> 01:04:49.471
I'm sorry about the blueprints.

01:04:49.472 --> 01:04:50.941
I shouldn't have said that.

01:04:50.942 --> 01:04:53.042
I didn't even look at them.

01:04:53.844 --> 01:04:55.144
No, no.

01:04:55.479 --> 01:04:58.347
You have a right
to your kind of house.

01:04:58.348 --> 01:05:00.250
Chieko and I started this place

01:05:00.251 --> 01:05:03.018
so there'd be a family
someday here.

01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:06.857
You and your tribe are
more than Chieko hoped for

01:05:06.858 --> 01:05:09.491
as far as the number
is concerned,

01:05:10.563 --> 01:05:13.632
but you saw something here
the day you drove up

01:05:13.633 --> 01:05:15.800
in that rattletrap Plymouth.

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:18.902
Don't forget what you saw.

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:30.749
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Munimura.

01:05:33.655 --> 01:05:35.888
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Lacey.

01:05:58.732 --> 01:06:00.032
Mama...

01:06:01.002 --> 01:06:03.069
You didn't open the rest
of your presents.

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.370
Tomorrow.

01:06:04.506 --> 01:06:06.206
Mama, come over here.

01:06:06.408 --> 01:06:07.841
I got to finish the dishes.

01:06:07.842 --> 01:06:10.409
Come on.
No, I mean it. I got to.

01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:23.959
Oh, good. They fit.

01:06:23.994 --> 01:06:25.294
Oh, good.

01:06:28.665 --> 01:06:30.432
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

01:06:34.239 --> 01:06:36.072
I'm just so damn tired.

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:41.409
W-well, maybe
you should go to bed.

01:06:46.152 --> 01:06:48.319
It's not that kind of tired.

01:06:51.558 --> 01:06:54.058
Sometimes I don't think I can...

01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:00.499
I feel like I'm...

01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:03.202
Pushing a car uphill...

01:07:04.505 --> 01:07:06.639
a... a big car
like our Plymouth...

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.007
up a steep hill,

01:07:08.242 --> 01:07:10.278
and I'm... I'm pushing
and pushing,

01:07:10.279 --> 01:07:12.979
and... and I push,
and I look down,

01:07:13.015 --> 01:07:15.083
and I can see
the ground under my feet,

01:07:15.084 --> 01:07:17.185
and then I look up,
and I can see all you,

01:07:17.186 --> 01:07:18.988
kids in the back seat.
Looking at me,

01:07:18.989 --> 01:07:20.956
and... and I'm pushing...

01:07:25.195 --> 01:07:27.628
But, mama, we're not in the car.

01:07:29.066 --> 01:07:30.899
We're helping you push.

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:34.970
Yeah.

01:07:37.108 --> 01:07:38.408
Yeah, you are.

01:07:40.312 --> 01:07:41.679
Of course, mama.

01:07:41.813 --> 01:07:43.580
We're the Lacey tribe.

01:07:45.217 --> 01:07:48.917
It just feels like you're
pushing alone sometimes.

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:51.656
Here.

01:07:51.657 --> 01:07:53.157
You open this one.

01:08:11.396 --> 01:08:13.563
That's from Annie and Craig.

01:08:14.232 --> 01:08:16.465
We helped, but just a little.

01:08:40.478 --> 01:08:41.778
Look at that.

01:08:43.215 --> 01:08:45.314
It was a long, long winter.

01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:48.618
Mama and I were still fighting,

01:08:48.754 --> 01:08:51.622
and being cooped up
in that shack didn't help.

01:08:51.624 --> 01:08:53.457
There wasn't anything to do

01:08:53.459 --> 01:08:54.959
or anywhere to go.

01:09:19.703 --> 01:09:20.839
I like that one.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.872
That's mine.
That's mine.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:24.475
Look at that.

01:09:24.475 --> 01:09:25.544
That looks...

01:09:25.545 --> 01:09:26.912
oh! Look at that one.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.212
Hello.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:29.948
Hi, kids.

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.250
Hi, mom.

01:09:31.618 --> 01:09:33.118
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, mom.

01:09:33.754 --> 01:09:35.520
Oh, what a pretty picture.

01:09:35.522 --> 01:09:36.689
Did you paint that?
Hmm-mm.

01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:37.990
Who is that?

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.394
That's you, that's
Craig, that's Shayne,

01:09:41.395 --> 01:09:43.962
and that's me,
and that's Murray.

01:09:45.033 --> 01:09:46.733
Hey...
What is this?

01:09:48.037 --> 01:09:49.437
What the hell are you doing,

01:09:49.438 --> 01:09:50.738
you little snot, huh?

01:09:50.738 --> 01:09:51.756
Shayne, watch it.

01:09:51.756 --> 01:09:53.657
This is my history book.

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:55.259
You've ruined my book.

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.093
Who cares?

01:09:56.094 --> 01:09:57.394
It's pretty.

01:09:57.698 --> 01:09:59.665
You draw in it every day.

01:09:59.933 --> 01:10:01.500
Yeah.
Naked women.

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:03.801
Shut up!
I'll smack you both!

01:10:04.153 --> 01:10:05.888
Shayne Patrick,
watch your mouth.

01:10:05.889 --> 01:10:07.189
Wait a minute.

01:10:08.225 --> 01:10:09.858
Where's my homework?

01:10:09.894 --> 01:10:10.000
Huh?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.194
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
Huh?

01:10:11.195 --> 01:10:12.628
Where is it? Huh?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:12.628 --> 01:10:12.797
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:12.797 --> 01:10:14.197
Shayne, I'm warning you.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:14.198 --> 01:10:15.498
I don't know!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.498 --> 01:10:16.001
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:16.001 --> 01:10:17.434
Tell me! Tell me!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:17.434 --> 01:10:18.036
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:18.036 --> 01:10:19.169
Get your father's belt.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:19.169 --> 01:10:19.170
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:20.537
Get it yourself.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:20.537 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:27.010
No, mama.
Please, mama.

01:10:27.947 --> 01:10:30.281
Listen to me.
When are you going to listen?

01:10:30.282 --> 01:10:31.516
Stop it.
You're hurting me.

01:10:31.517 --> 01:10:32.817
Stop it, mama!

01:10:34.253 --> 01:10:35.553
Mama!

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.956
Stop it!

01:10:36.957 --> 01:10:38.657
Stop it, mama!
Stop!

01:10:38.959 --> 01:10:40.259
Stop, please.

01:10:59.048 --> 01:11:01.148
I didn't speak to my mother

01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:03.252
or look her in the eye
for 5 days

01:11:03.253 --> 01:11:05.755
after she took
my dad's belt to me.

01:11:05.756 --> 01:11:08.056
I didn't think she even cared.

01:11:40.795 --> 01:11:42.962
You and I remember him best.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.100
Craig and Annie are too young.

01:11:56.227 --> 01:11:58.327
Do you ever get mad at him?

01:11:59.766 --> 01:12:01.066
What...

01:12:02.502 --> 01:12:04.469
For leaving us like this?

01:12:05.538 --> 01:12:06.838
Sometimes.

01:12:10.878 --> 01:12:14.778
I get mad at him for a whole
bushel basket of things,

01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:18.049
but you can't really blame

01:12:18.119 --> 01:12:20.159
that goddamn vagabond, Irish
Catholic son of a bitch

01:12:20.183 --> 01:12:21.750
for dying, can you?

01:12:23.558 --> 01:12:24.858
No.

01:12:28.998 --> 01:12:30.298
Just...

01:12:31.968 --> 01:12:35.535
Sometimes I wish things
were a little different.

01:12:41.194 --> 01:12:44.361
You don't want to be
the man of the house.

01:12:45.133 --> 01:12:47.334
I know what you have to give up,

01:12:47.335 --> 01:12:49.169
the things you can't do
at school.

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:50.703
You don't have any friends.

01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:52.737
You have responsibilities.

01:12:56.011 --> 01:12:58.978
I was a kid myself
once, too, you know.

01:13:03.035 --> 01:13:05.668
Wanted to go to parties,
have fun,

01:13:05.738 --> 01:13:08.573
dance my life away,
dance with all the boys,

01:13:08.574 --> 01:13:10.674
neck until the sun came up,

01:13:10.743 --> 01:13:12.576
but this is what I got.

01:13:16.333 --> 01:13:18.700
This is what happens sometimes.

01:13:29.898 --> 01:13:31.998
You work with what you get,

01:13:32.368 --> 01:13:34.668
and you try to make it better.

01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:03.918
I'll pick you up
around 3:00.

01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:05.219
Thanks. See ya.

01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:28.979
Mom, it's cold.

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:30.147
Are you ok?

01:14:30.148 --> 01:14:31.448
Yeah.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:35.485
It's going to be beautiful.

01:14:36.354 --> 01:14:38.924
We'll finish the first
floor this summer.

01:14:38.925 --> 01:14:41.092
We'll do some exterior work,

01:14:41.193 --> 01:14:44.496
then next year we'll start
on the second floor.

01:14:44.497 --> 01:14:46.530
You'll have your own room.

01:14:47.701 --> 01:14:51.003
It's going to be all
buttoned up and beautiful.

01:14:51.004 --> 01:14:52.304
Yeah.

01:14:53.574 --> 01:14:54.874
Mom...

01:14:56.344 --> 01:14:57.511
Can I ask you a question?

01:14:57.512 --> 01:14:58.812
Hmm?

01:14:59.815 --> 01:15:01.382
Can I go on a date?

01:15:02.383 --> 01:15:03.683
Sure.

01:15:03.885 --> 01:15:05.185
I can?

01:15:05.888 --> 01:15:07.589
I've been known to go on a date

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:09.324
once or twice myself, you know.

01:15:09.325 --> 01:15:10.625
Really?

01:15:13.529 --> 01:15:14.829
Mom...

01:15:17.334 --> 01:15:18.634
I'm sorry.

01:15:21.404 --> 01:15:23.971
I'm sorry about
being mad at you.

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:27.008
You know, for going
to dinner and...

01:15:27.445 --> 01:15:29.012
Going on that date.

01:15:35.087 --> 01:15:37.021
Mama went all out
for the occasion.

01:15:37.022 --> 01:15:38.656
We went to the thrift shop

01:15:38.657 --> 01:15:41.693
and picked out a jacket,
slacks, shoes...

01:15:41.694 --> 01:15:44.530
They were used, but they
were the best I ever had.

01:15:44.531 --> 01:15:45.931
You look nice, Shayne.

01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:47.365
Oh, thanks, Faye.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.737
You going to squeeze
her boobies?

01:15:54.142 --> 01:15:55.908
All right. I'll get you.

01:15:55.909 --> 01:15:58.111
I'll get daddy's belt on you.

01:15:58.112 --> 01:15:59.412
You boys.

01:16:01.733 --> 01:16:03.700
Oh, mom.
You look great.

01:16:04.987 --> 01:16:06.487
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:16:06.855 --> 01:16:08.155
You look really nice.

01:16:08.156 --> 01:16:09.789
Look at you, Shayne.

01:16:09.826 --> 01:16:11.359
Ain't he a handsome devil?

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.861
Looks just like his father,

01:16:12.862 --> 01:16:14.530
that goddamn vagabond...

01:16:14.531 --> 01:16:16.831
Irish Catholic son of a bitch.

01:16:18.868 --> 01:16:20.436
Are you going to
the dance with Shayne?

01:16:20.437 --> 01:16:21.937
I got my own date.

01:16:27.477 --> 01:16:28.777
That's them.

01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:33.781
You'll never get a date,
Murray, you stink bug.

01:16:34.953 --> 01:16:36.786
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:38.588
- I'm nervous.
- Are you?

01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:41.324
Here.
Don't tell the others.

01:16:41.594 --> 01:16:43.194
I knew what that money
meant to mama...

01:16:43.195 --> 01:16:44.628
And to our house.

01:16:45.798 --> 01:16:47.831
- Bye, Shayne.
- Bye, Shayne.

01:16:47.968 --> 01:16:49.335
- Bye, mama.
- Bye.

01:16:49.636 --> 01:16:50.502
Good luck on your date.

01:16:50.503 --> 01:16:51.803
Ok.

01:16:52.338 --> 01:16:53.839
That dollar meant more to me,

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.207
than anything she ever gave me.

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:07.789
You never forget
your first real date.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.523
I didn't know how to dance,

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:12.891
much less how to ask a girl
to dance with me.

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:16.131
It sure was different
than practicing with mama,

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:18.967
but I had the first,
best time of my life.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.735
"Oh, don't you know?"

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:24.271
"don't you know
you'll be my fool?"

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:27.343
"you got me cryin'"

01:17:29.113 --> 01:17:30.413
"cryin' again"

01:17:33.183 --> 01:17:36.216
"when will you let
this heartache end?"

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.140
"emotion"

01:17:42.544 --> 01:17:44.311
"you gave me up then"

01:17:46.949 --> 01:17:48.782
"why make me remember"

01:17:50.386 --> 01:17:52.219
"what I wanna forget?"

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:25.758
May I have the pleasure?

01:18:25.759 --> 01:18:27.059
Well, Norman.

01:18:27.594 --> 01:18:28.994
Dance with me, Frances.

01:18:28.995 --> 01:18:30.931
Well, let's go on inside.

01:18:30.932 --> 01:18:32.499
It's cold out here.

01:18:32.567 --> 01:18:35.000
Well, I'm a good
keeper-warmer.

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:36.703
- Norman...
- What?

01:18:36.738 --> 01:18:38.573
Come on.
Let's go dance...

01:18:38.574 --> 01:18:40.742
we're definitely kicking up
our heels tonight, but...

01:18:40.743 --> 01:18:42.043
- After.
- After?

01:18:42.845 --> 01:18:44.145
What is this?

01:18:44.246 --> 01:18:46.413
This is the key to paradise.

01:18:47.015 --> 01:18:48.484
You're presuming a bit,
aren't you?

01:18:48.485 --> 01:18:49.918
I don't think so.

01:18:50.286 --> 01:18:52.455
You're free, white, and
more than a nod past 21.

01:18:52.456 --> 01:18:54.557
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, we both are.

01:18:54.558 --> 01:18:56.692
We'll get it out of the way.

01:18:56.693 --> 01:19:00.597
Save some awkwardness, and we
don't smell like cigarette smoke.

01:19:00.598 --> 01:19:03.498
'Sides, I drink too much
when I dance,

01:19:04.234 --> 01:19:06.436
and I ain't worth
a shit in the sack then.

01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:07.872
Well, that's romantic
as all hell.

01:19:07.873 --> 01:19:09.273
Look, it's paid for.

01:19:09.274 --> 01:19:11.041
Why waste it? Come on.

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:13.878
Hey, what are you doing?

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.848
Either we go dancing
or take me home.

01:19:15.849 --> 01:19:16.982
Oh! Don't act
like no virgin.

01:19:16.983 --> 01:19:18.283
What?

01:19:18.885 --> 01:19:21.487
A woman with six kids
has been around the block.

01:19:21.488 --> 01:19:23.388
I don't roll on my back,

01:19:23.456 --> 01:19:25.725
for every asshole
who scratches my belly.

01:19:25.726 --> 01:19:28.027
You ought to. Not many
guys will make this offer.

01:19:28.028 --> 01:19:29.629
I should be so lucky.

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:30.930
Come on, honey.

01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:32.799
Let go of me!

01:19:33.584 --> 01:19:35.652
Take your hand off me.
Take your hand off me.

01:19:35.653 --> 01:19:36.953
Settle down.

01:19:37.421 --> 01:19:39.389
This isn't going to happen.

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:41.691
Are we going to stand here
until the snow comes again?

01:19:41.692 --> 01:19:42.992
Let go!

01:19:43.228 --> 01:19:45.195
Don't tell me what to do!

01:19:45.297 --> 01:19:46.397
I could make you.

01:19:46.398 --> 01:19:47.698
You could try.

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:55.907
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

01:19:58.044 --> 01:20:00.112
Come on.
Will you get out of there?

01:20:00.113 --> 01:20:02.480
You're steaming up the windows.

01:20:02.984 --> 01:20:04.284
Hey, guys.

01:20:04.652 --> 01:20:05.952
Let's go.

01:20:10.691 --> 01:20:11.991
Ha ha ha.

01:20:12.394 --> 01:20:14.361
"Since I first met you."

01:20:18.466 --> 01:20:19.766
"I pray..."

01:20:22.872 --> 01:20:24.306
See you, lover boy.

01:20:24.307 --> 01:20:25.607
Bye, Raymi.

01:20:52.672 --> 01:20:54.072
Hey, mom, what you doing?

01:20:54.073 --> 01:20:55.373
Sitting.

01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:57.508
Go on in.

01:20:57.610 --> 01:20:59.443
I'll be in in a minute.

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:00.979
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

01:21:01.314 --> 01:21:02.614
I'm fine.

01:21:04.785 --> 01:21:06.285
How was your date?

01:21:07.254 --> 01:21:08.687
It was all right.

01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:10.690
How was yours?

01:21:13.394 --> 01:21:14.694
Mom?

01:21:16.064 --> 01:21:17.364
Mom?

01:21:20.185 --> 01:21:21.485
What happened?

01:21:26.126 --> 01:21:28.759
I just made a mistake,
that's all.

01:21:32.716 --> 01:21:34.449
I don't know what it is,

01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:36.153
but if there's a son of a bitch

01:21:36.154 --> 01:21:38.321
within 70 Miles, he'll find me.

01:21:38.322 --> 01:21:41.089
Been that way
since your daddy died.

01:21:42.259 --> 01:21:43.626
Any horse's ass.

01:21:44.963 --> 01:21:47.065
I just walk right up
to him and s-say,

01:21:47.066 --> 01:21:49.033
"here I am, you asshole."

01:21:49.301 --> 01:21:52.534
"Why don't you chew me up
and spit me out?"

01:21:53.271 --> 01:21:54.571
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.110
It's going to be ok, ok?

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.380
I promise.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:06.483
Honey, it's not your
fault, it's his.

01:22:06.987 --> 01:22:08.620
Now go on, will you?

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.892
It's going to be ok, mom.

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:17.464
Come on.

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:20.466
It's going to be all right.

01:22:35.419 --> 01:22:36.752
Was dad ever mean to you?

01:22:36.753 --> 01:22:38.053
No.

01:22:39.889 --> 01:22:42.456
He was the finest man
I ever met.

01:22:43.794 --> 01:22:45.894
He treated me like a queen.

01:22:47.898 --> 01:22:50.131
Promise me something, Shayne.

01:22:52.804 --> 01:22:55.607
Promise me you'll never
beat on a woman.

01:22:55.608 --> 01:22:56.975
Yeah, I promise.

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:59.277
Never beat on anybody.

01:23:00.113 --> 01:23:01.413
It hurts,

01:23:01.648 --> 01:23:02.948
inside and out.

01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:07.953
Yeah.

01:23:08.856 --> 01:23:10.156
I know it does.

01:23:17.298 --> 01:23:18.598
Go to bed.

01:23:18.733 --> 01:23:20.000
But...

01:23:20.001 --> 01:23:21.301
please.

01:23:22.704 --> 01:23:24.004
Go to bed.

01:23:46.764 --> 01:23:48.064
What is it?

01:23:53.672 --> 01:23:55.505
Annie.
Annie, wake up.

01:24:35.886 --> 01:24:36.986
Are you all right?

01:24:36.987 --> 01:24:38.287
All right.

01:24:39.522 --> 01:24:41.023
You look beautiful today.

01:24:41.024 --> 01:24:42.759
You mind me saying that?

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.627
It's true.
You really do.

01:24:44.628 --> 01:24:46.562
Now... This spot
down here...

01:24:46.563 --> 01:24:47.863
Ok.

01:24:50.401 --> 01:24:51.701
Uhh!

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:54.471
Aah!

01:24:59.945 --> 01:25:01.445
You hit my mother!

01:25:02.965 --> 01:25:04.032
Aah!

01:25:04.033 --> 01:25:05.333
Oh!

01:25:06.118 --> 01:25:07.818
Crazy little bastard.

01:25:11.958 --> 01:25:13.391
Call the sheriff!

01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:14.993
Somebody!

01:25:16.063 --> 01:25:17.363
Aah!

01:25:18.332 --> 01:25:20.299
Say you did it!
Come on!

01:25:20.835 --> 01:25:23.268
Say you did it!
Say you did it!

01:25:24.306 --> 01:25:26.206
Say you...
say you did it!

01:25:26.207 --> 01:25:27.507
Say it!

01:25:27.542 --> 01:25:28.975
Say it now!
Now!

01:25:29.312 --> 01:25:30.945
I never touched her!

01:25:31.347 --> 01:25:33.514
Where'd you get the scratch?

01:25:33.516 --> 01:25:35.517
'Cause she fights
just like you do.

01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:36.818
Ohh!

01:25:41.891 --> 01:25:43.191
Ohh...

01:25:44.294 --> 01:25:45.594
Uhh...

01:26:10.056 --> 01:26:11.689
- Mr. hilliard.
- Yeah.

01:26:11.924 --> 01:26:13.444
Can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:14.768
Sure.

01:26:16.763 --> 01:26:18.063
Um...

01:26:21.835 --> 01:26:23.868
I can't work here anymore.

01:26:23.937 --> 01:26:25.237
Why?

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.674
I quit. I can't work
here with Norman,

01:26:27.675 --> 01:26:30.175
not after what he did to my boy.

01:26:32.381 --> 01:26:34.749
Uh-huh. Well, Norman
doesn't work here anymore.

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:36.050
I let him go.

01:26:40.156 --> 01:26:41.456
Really?

01:26:42.125 --> 01:26:43.425
Yeah, really.

01:26:45.795 --> 01:26:47.895
So if Norman's the problem,

01:26:48.165 --> 01:26:50.665
you really don't have a problem.

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:56.907
And listen, Frances...

01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:01.377
Why don't you take the day off?

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.380
And I'll see you in the morning.

01:27:05.351 --> 01:27:06.651
Ok?

01:27:08.087 --> 01:27:09.920
Things will get better.

01:27:10.857 --> 01:27:12.157
You'll see.

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:41.503
Lacey tribe, may I have
your attention, please?

01:27:41.607 --> 01:27:43.508
What do you want, Murray?

01:27:43.509 --> 01:27:46.009
Just come here.
It's a surprise.

01:27:46.278 --> 01:27:47.578
Too busy.

01:27:47.647 --> 01:27:49.682
You're never too busy for this.

01:27:49.683 --> 01:27:51.016
Come on, hurry up.

01:27:51.017 --> 01:27:52.317
Yeah, hurry up.

01:27:54.488 --> 01:27:55.788
One...

01:27:56.974 --> 01:27:58.274
Two...

01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:00.310
Three!

01:28:01.279 --> 01:28:02.579
Aah! Ha ha!

01:28:05.016 --> 01:28:07.251
Lacey tribe!
We're coming up in the world!

01:28:07.252 --> 01:28:09.988
Indoor plumbing.
Who gets the first turn?

01:28:09.989 --> 01:28:11.689
- Ooh, I do.
- I do.

01:28:11.724 --> 01:28:13.024
I do.

01:29:00.327 --> 01:29:01.627
Craig! Shayne!

01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:03.230
Come down here!

01:29:03.231 --> 01:29:04.531
Murray!

01:29:09.104 --> 01:29:10.404
Come on!

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:16.160
Bye, outhouse!
Yeah!

01:29:16.663 --> 01:29:18.763
Murray, what are you doing?

01:29:19.131 --> 01:29:20.431
Dirty.

01:29:22.436 --> 01:29:23.770
Ok, this is dirty.

01:29:23.771 --> 01:29:25.071
Clean.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:30.073
Annie, look at this spot.
It's dirty.

01:29:31.546 --> 01:29:33.713
Whoopee-doo.
A little spot.

01:29:35.917 --> 01:29:37.685
Look at that thing burn.

01:29:37.686 --> 01:29:38.785
Yeah!

01:29:38.786 --> 01:29:40.086
Yeah, cool!

01:29:40.739 --> 01:29:42.039
Great!

01:29:42.441 --> 01:29:44.341
Look at that thing burn!

01:29:44.694 --> 01:29:45.994
Hanky.

01:29:52.085 --> 01:29:53.252
All right!

01:29:53.253 --> 01:29:54.353
- Yeah!
- Yay!

01:29:54.354 --> 01:29:55.654
Yeah!

01:29:57.390 --> 01:30:00.126
I don't have to go to that
stinking outhouse anymore!

01:30:00.127 --> 01:30:01.827
I hate that outhouse!

01:30:02.596 --> 01:30:03.896
What?

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:05.498
It's burning!

01:30:05.917 --> 01:30:08.219
Craig, Annie,
go to Mr. Moon's!

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:09.988
Get him to call the
fire department! Go!

01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:11.222
Hurry!

01:30:11.223 --> 01:30:12.590
Murray, come on!

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:17.945
Come on, Murray!

01:30:18.915 --> 01:30:20.215
Come on!

01:30:55.122 --> 01:30:56.255
It's frozen.

01:30:56.256 --> 01:30:57.556
Aah!

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.327
The red dress.

01:31:01.328 --> 01:31:02.594
With the white bows.

01:31:02.595 --> 01:31:03.895
Good for you.

01:31:04.065 --> 01:31:05.898
Matching lipstick, too.

01:31:06.634 --> 01:31:08.068
Hey, look at that smoke.

01:31:08.069 --> 01:31:09.369
Where?

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:11.590
Right there. Isn't that
close to your house?

01:31:11.614 --> 01:31:12.914
Oh, my God.

01:31:13.775 --> 01:31:16.142
I'm going to get the money jar.

01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.613
Boys, get down from the roof!

01:31:29.426 --> 01:31:32.326
Murray, get out of here!
It's too hot!

01:31:50.049 --> 01:31:51.349
Are you ok?

01:31:51.584 --> 01:31:53.284
What happened?
I'm sorry, mama.

01:31:53.285 --> 01:31:54.585
Are you ok?

01:31:56.255 --> 01:31:57.555
Where's Lynn?

01:31:57.924 --> 01:31:59.325
Mommy, Lynn went
back in the house!

01:31:59.326 --> 01:31:59.993
She's in the house!

01:31:59.994 --> 01:32:01.294
Lynn!

01:32:01.561 --> 01:32:02.861
Lynn!

01:32:03.831 --> 01:32:05.131
Lynn!

01:32:07.234 --> 01:32:08.534
Lynn!

01:32:08.903 --> 01:32:10.203
Lynn!

01:32:10.722 --> 01:32:12.022
Lynn!

01:32:13.491 --> 01:32:15.159
Mama, I couldn't find
the money jar.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.194
Doesn't matter.
Are you ok?

01:32:17.195 --> 01:32:18.495
Got to find it.

01:32:44.526 --> 01:32:46.260
By the time they got there,

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:48.846
there was nothing
the firemen could do.

01:32:48.847 --> 01:32:51.082
I even remember
the way they put it...

01:32:51.083 --> 01:32:53.783
"the structure
was fully consumed."

01:33:05.516 --> 01:33:07.216
I think the less you have,

01:33:07.217 --> 01:33:09.586
the more it hurts
when you lose it,

01:33:09.587 --> 01:33:11.554
and that fire hurt a lot.

01:33:56.205 --> 01:33:57.505
Murray.

01:34:01.711 --> 01:34:03.011
Sorry, mama.

01:34:04.882 --> 01:34:06.182
I'm so sorry.

01:34:08.852 --> 01:34:10.152
Oh, honey...

01:34:11.155 --> 01:34:12.788
It's not your fault.

01:34:14.759 --> 01:34:16.059
Not your fault.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.727
I just burnt down our house.

01:34:18.763 --> 01:34:20.031
Oh...

01:34:20.032 --> 01:34:21.332
Listen.

01:34:22.234 --> 01:34:23.801
It was an accident.

01:34:25.304 --> 01:34:28.804
It was an accident, honey.
It's nobody's fault.

01:34:28.942 --> 01:34:30.242
Oh, baby...

01:34:31.378 --> 01:34:33.011
It's nobody's fault.

01:34:42.856 --> 01:34:44.156
Come on.

01:35:11.655 --> 01:35:12.955
Save the nails.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.260
Unh!

01:35:17.261 --> 01:35:18.561
Ha ha!

01:35:19.296 --> 01:35:22.663
Oh. Lynn, everything's
going to be all right.

01:35:23.668 --> 01:35:24.602
We can start over.

01:35:24.603 --> 01:35:25.903
Ha ha!

01:35:26.605 --> 01:35:30.124
Everything's going to be all
buttoned up and beautiful.

01:35:30.125 --> 01:35:31.425
Bullshit!

01:35:33.863 --> 01:35:35.998
Nothing's going to be all right.

01:35:35.999 --> 01:35:38.032
You're only saying that...

01:35:38.068 --> 01:35:40.301
"buttoned up
and beautiful."

01:35:40.687 --> 01:35:42.321
Don't tell them that
if they're good,

01:35:42.322 --> 01:35:43.823
everything will work out.

01:35:43.824 --> 01:35:45.791
It doesn't work that way.

01:35:47.762 --> 01:35:49.929
"Buttoned up and beautiful"?

01:35:51.265 --> 01:35:53.298
You're always saying that!

01:35:53.685 --> 01:35:56.304
And we believe it,
and it hurts us

01:35:56.305 --> 01:35:59.057
every time we have
to hear it from you!

01:35:59.058 --> 01:36:00.558
Don't lie to them!

01:36:05.798 --> 01:36:08.831
I don't know what to
say to you, Shayne.

01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:13.039
I don't know what
you want to hear.

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.408
I guess you want a different
family, a different life.

01:36:15.409 --> 01:36:16.976
Well, it isn't going to happen.

01:36:16.977 --> 01:36:18.677
This is what you got.

01:36:21.783 --> 01:36:24.651
You think I don't want
something more?

01:36:24.652 --> 01:36:26.485
Life isn't fair, buddy.

01:36:26.888 --> 01:36:29.521
Sometimes it's just
goddamn lousy.

01:36:32.244 --> 01:36:34.079
You want to go back
to Los Angeles?

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.580
Go on. We'll manage
without you.

01:36:36.982 --> 01:36:38.984
You don't have to be the
man of the house anymore.

01:36:38.985 --> 01:36:40.818
We'll manage just fine.

01:36:40.821 --> 01:36:42.621
I managed without your dad.

01:36:42.622 --> 01:36:44.690
I don't know how I did
that, but I did it.

01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:47.226
We'll manage without
a lot of things.

01:36:47.227 --> 01:36:49.660
Go on, get the hell out of here.

01:36:57.973 --> 01:36:59.273
Mama.

01:37:13.757 --> 01:37:16.124
Mr. Moon!

01:37:16.293 --> 01:37:18.393
Come on, pull up over here!

01:37:39.769 --> 01:37:41.069
Mrs. Lacey,

01:37:41.638 --> 01:37:43.238
I know you don't take charity.

01:37:43.239 --> 01:37:45.107
You'll be getting a bill.

01:37:45.108 --> 01:37:46.876
Let's go, let's go, everybody!

01:37:46.877 --> 01:37:48.645
Mr. Munimura,
I can't accept this.

01:37:48.646 --> 01:37:50.879
I can't owe people.
I can't.

01:37:51.949 --> 01:37:53.582
We're going to do it

01:37:53.652 --> 01:37:56.152
no matter what you say, Frances.

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:00.923
It's going to be ok.

01:38:03.128 --> 01:38:04.561
Let's go to work!

01:38:11.755 --> 01:38:13.221
Thank you so much.

01:38:13.222 --> 01:38:14.522
Mama.

01:38:14.724 --> 01:38:16.024
Mama.

01:38:16.793 --> 01:38:18.093
Mama.

01:38:18.962 --> 01:38:20.596
Look at all
the pretty toys you got.

01:38:20.597 --> 01:38:21.897
My goodness.

01:38:38.984 --> 01:38:39.784
I think we're level.

01:38:39.785 --> 01:38:41.085
Come on!

01:38:43.473 --> 01:38:47.240
I don't know. Should it go
over there a little bit?

01:38:51.065 --> 01:38:52.565
Watch the fingers!

01:38:59.274 --> 01:39:00.574
There you go.

01:39:28.957 --> 01:39:31.124
So mama let them build it...

01:39:31.225 --> 01:39:34.227
But just to where it was
before the fire.

01:39:34.228 --> 01:39:37.165
After that, it took us six
months to finish our house...

01:39:37.166 --> 01:39:39.733
And 4 years
to pay everyone back.

01:39:40.202 --> 01:39:43.302
Ok Mr. Moon, come on!
Mom! Get everybody!

01:39:44.239 --> 01:39:46.709
I took a picture
the day we moved back in.

01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:49.010
This camera was borrowed, too.

01:39:54.618 --> 01:39:56.720
Now I'll tell you something
else that's really true,

01:39:56.721 --> 01:39:58.989
but you probably
won't believe it.

01:39:58.990 --> 01:40:01.091
I've never been
back to L.A.,

01:40:01.092 --> 01:40:03.859
and I still live
in Hankston, Idaho.

01:40:04.296 --> 01:40:06.129
Whatever tore us apart,

01:40:06.398 --> 01:40:08.038
building that house
brought us together...

01:40:08.062 --> 01:40:09.166
Forever.

01:40:09.234 --> 01:40:10.534
We...

01:40:10.569 --> 01:40:12.269
Were the Lacey tribe.
