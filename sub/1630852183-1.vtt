00:12.263 --> 00:14.473
[Camille] High above
the Himalayan Mountains,

00:14.473 --> 00:17.768
there is a tribe of people
called the Mosuo,

00:17.768 --> 00:21.272
living in what has been
named the Kingdom of Women.

00:21.272 --> 00:23.774
Here the women are openly
stronger than the men

00:23.774 --> 00:25.526
and entirely in charge.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.987
They practice
walking marriage.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.531
The women choose who
they want to be married to.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.742
And when things
get old or stale,

00:32.742 --> 00:34.326
they simply decide boom,

00:34.326 --> 00:35.995
they're not married anymore,

00:35.995 --> 00:37.913
and they move on
to another husband.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.915
And another. And another.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.001
And the guy has no say.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.669
The woman's
pleasure and convenience

00:43.669 --> 00:45.171
is all that matters.

00:45.171 --> 00:46.464
She's in control,

00:46.464 --> 00:49.508
and it's easy,
fast, and painless.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.594
[laughs] Must be nice.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.849
Here, now,
in 21st-century Harlem,

00:56.849 --> 00:58.601
being a woman in total control

00:58.601 --> 01:02.021
of her life and love
is not always easy.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.023
One theory on why the Mosuo

01:04.023 --> 01:06.400
not only survive, but thrive,

01:06.400 --> 01:09.904
is that they are a tribe
of unbreakable sisters.

01:09.904 --> 01:12.865
And luckily,
I've got one of those too.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.825
[singer]

01:25.169 --> 01:28.422
[Camille] We have always had
to go faster, further, better

01:28.422 --> 01:31.133
just to be seen
as barely keeping up.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.177
But how do we do that in love,

01:33.177 --> 01:35.262
especially now,
when in Harlem,

01:35.262 --> 01:37.181
change is everywhere you look?

01:37.181 --> 01:38.641
[singer]

01:38.641 --> 01:40.267
[Camille] And it can become
increasingly hard

01:40.267 --> 01:41.811
to hang on to who you are

01:41.811 --> 01:44.688
when you barely recognize
where you are.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.065
[singer]

01:54.824 --> 01:57.993
[Camille] At some point, you
just begrudgingly accept

01:57.993 --> 02:00.204
things just don't look the way
you thought they would.

02:00.204 --> 02:03.332
And that comes to dating too.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.752
Because the number of
actual dateable men is bleak.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.171
In Harlem,
educated Black women

02:09.171 --> 02:11.006
are forced to navigate
a playing field in which

02:11.006 --> 02:14.134
men have significantly
more dating options.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.971
So it's not that we're
desperate or thirsty.

02:16.971 --> 02:20.516
We're literally dealing with
a real life man deficit,

02:20.516 --> 02:22.726
which leaves us
with two options.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.478
We reassess our deal breakers

02:24.478 --> 02:26.397
and widen the pool

02:26.397 --> 02:29.608
or we hold firm
to our wish list

02:29.608 --> 02:30.901
and, like the Mosuo,

02:30.901 --> 02:33.696
refuse to settle,
despite the numbers.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.406
And we focus--

02:35.406 --> 02:37.867
okay, well,
maybe overly focus--

02:37.867 --> 02:40.619
okay, okay, obsess--
on trying to control

02:40.619 --> 02:41.954
the one thing that we can:

02:41.954 --> 02:44.582
ourselves.

02:44.582 --> 02:45.833
So yes,

02:45.833 --> 02:47.877
I'm here to say

02:47.877 --> 02:50.045
we are not Mosuo.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.630
But this week,

02:51.630 --> 02:54.091
what if we were?

02:54.091 --> 02:56.844
I want you to try to live
like Mosuo.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.096
Women, be the boss.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.472
Demand change when you want it.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.516
Stop apologizing so damn much.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.520
Men, do what the women say
without question.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.231
I want us to get out
of those comfort zones.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.276
And give me 500 words
on what that was like.

03:13.903 --> 03:16.280
Class dismissed.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.454
That was amazing.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.956
Professor,
I have something for you.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.378
[heartbeat echoing]

03:31.378 --> 03:34.048
Thank you, Malik, again.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.507
You're welcome.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.717
And by the way,

03:36.717 --> 03:38.260
if you wanna help me
with the assignment,

03:38.260 --> 03:40.387
I would be happy
to get out of my comfort zone

03:40.387 --> 03:41.847
and eagerly do
whatever you say.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.517
Malik, it's against
Columbia's rules,

03:45.517 --> 03:46.936
and frankly, my moral code,

03:46.936 --> 03:48.354
for me to date a student.

03:48.354 --> 03:49.688
[Malik] Mm.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.940
Goodbye, Malik.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.109
Kansas State is offering me

03:54.109 --> 03:56.445
full-time professor
with tenure.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.197
And you wanna move to Kansas?

03:58.197 --> 03:59.281
No, no.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.741
Of course, no, I don't want to.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.077
But I'm not gonna lie, Robin,
the offer's nice.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.244
It better be.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.621
It's in Kansas.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.583
No.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.585
I'm sure the offer
is tempting, Camille,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.420
but these things
are like dating.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.798
You can't just jump
on the first sexy thing

04:15.798 --> 04:17.800
that comes your way
just because he's nice.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.802
I know.
Columbia is what I want.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.971
Columbia is my soulmate,

04:21.971 --> 04:23.180
but the bitch won't commit.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.600
Sorry.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.352
I just need to know
that I'm not gonna wind up

04:28.352 --> 04:30.854
being Columbia's
oldest adjunct professor.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.524
I didn't work with you
all these years

04:33.524 --> 04:35.484
to let that happen.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.777
I was waiting to surprise you.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.028
As soon as the budget's in,

04:38.028 --> 04:39.697
I'm gonna move the money
to have you

04:39.697 --> 04:41.615
join the department full-time.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.952
I promise.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.036
Thank you.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.705
You're welcome.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.289
[bagel crunches]

04:49.289 --> 04:50.624
Why did you let me do that?

04:52.001 --> 04:53.585
I gotta hide it somewhere.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.504
That's--
that's what it's come to.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.632
[Camille] From the moment
we all graduated,

04:58.632 --> 05:00.592
all I wanted was to become
a full-time professor.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.844
Now it's happening.

05:01.844 --> 05:04.263
[Quinn] Oh, a promotion
and a proposition.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.681
Bitch, tell me
you fucked that nigga

05:05.681 --> 05:07.391
right there on the desk.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.726
Of course not.

05:08.726 --> 05:09.727
Why does all the hot shit

05:09.727 --> 05:11.353
get wasted on everyone but me?

05:11.353 --> 05:12.646
She's his teacher, Angie.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.064
And it's a "MeToo"
waiting to happen.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.232
No, fuck that.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.525
A good dick

05:16.525 --> 05:18.152
is a terrible thing to waste.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.696
- Hey, sorry.
- Hey, girl.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.573
Late to her own party.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.366
Camille is no fun.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.659
There, you are all caught up.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.327
Jesus, I need a drink.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.955
Ooh, wait, that was there
before we sat down.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.373
[Quinn] So how did it go?

05:31.373 --> 05:33.000
Are you officially
a millionaire?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.335
Well, we were meeting
in my office

05:35.335 --> 05:36.545
and I said...

05:37.546 --> 05:39.006
Wow.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.759
$750,000.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.093
Mr. Van Horn.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.054
Please, Tye, it's Rick.

05:45.054 --> 05:48.390
Okay, great...Rick.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.683
[Rick] That is a lot of money.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.268
So what do you think?

05:51.268 --> 05:52.603
You're ready to sell Q

05:52.603 --> 05:54.813
and take your seat
at the big kids' table, Tye?

05:54.813 --> 05:56.940
What do I think?

05:57.983 --> 05:59.318
I think...

05:59.318 --> 06:01.195
only a fucking idiot

06:01.195 --> 06:03.030
would agree
to that kind of valuation.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.782
And of the two of us,
I'd say I'm not the one

06:04.782 --> 06:06.283
who looks like a fucking idiot.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.119
Nice suit, by the way.
Give 1987 my regards.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.872
Q is the only online dating app
worth the shit

06:11.872 --> 06:13.999
that's reaching the fastest
growing market there is:

06:13.999 --> 06:16.210
queer people of color.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.462
So do I wanna join your seat
at the big kids' table?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.589
I'm a grown-ass woman.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.382
And I'm of two minds:

06:22.382 --> 06:23.926
no,

06:23.926 --> 06:26.261
and fucking hell no.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.889
But thanks
for dropping by, Rick.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.266
You're sure you wanna--
I mean...

06:31.266 --> 06:32.893
surely you can weigh in here.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.977
My assistant?

06:34.770 --> 06:37.481
You want my assistant
to weigh in on my decision?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.650
He's your--really?

06:39.650 --> 06:40.901
Yeah.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.944
Really.

06:41.944 --> 06:45.531
Oh, and by the way, Rick,

06:45.531 --> 06:48.700
the name isn't Tye, it's...

06:48.700 --> 06:50.244
Your Highness.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.495
Yes, yes!

06:51.495 --> 06:53.539
- Come on, Tye.
- Yes, queen.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.499
Ms. Jackson, if you nasty.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.084
If you nasty.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.211
- See, you could be part Mosuo.
- Part what?

06:59.211 --> 07:00.295
[Angie] Way to bring it down

07:00.295 --> 07:02.047
with an Annalise Keating
teaching moment.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.799
It is only a tribe of women

07:03.799 --> 07:05.300
who call their own shots.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.426
That is me.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.345
Bitch, that's us.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.514
Ooh!

07:10.514 --> 07:13.183
[camera clicking]

07:13.183 --> 07:14.518
[Angie laughs]

07:14.518 --> 07:16.061
Are we supposed to pretend
that didn't just happen?

07:16.061 --> 07:18.021
New lady.
She's into sexting.

07:18.021 --> 07:21.024
Ooh, be careful.
That Internet shit is forever.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.151
You would not believe
the things

07:22.151 --> 07:23.360
that guys have posted of me.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.611
I would sorta believe.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.488
So this new lady,
she's a model?

07:26.488 --> 07:27.614
Instagram influencer?

07:27.614 --> 07:29.158
Model/Instagram influencer?

07:29.158 --> 07:32.494
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, you do have a type.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.873
We will take the 1988 bottle
of Sauvignon Blanc.

07:35.873 --> 07:36.915
Ooh.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.542
I'll take one of those too.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.544
With a straw.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.129
I'm bored.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.382
Better off or on?

07:45.382 --> 07:49.845
Off or on?

07:49.845 --> 07:51.597
Okay, okay.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.891
Every woman has value.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.226
And you pay it
in cash or PayPal.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.769
[laughter]

07:57.769 --> 07:58.896
Whatever.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.063
Tye, we get it.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.149
You like simple
so you can be in charge.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.568
That's not true.

08:04.568 --> 08:05.694
- Is it?
- Bitch, please.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.363
- Yeah, definitely.
- Completely.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.364
Ooh, wait, wait, wait.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.283
That wasn't ours either.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.577
Then who ordered drinks?

08:13.577 --> 08:15.787
So now I'm thinking

08:15.787 --> 08:18.665
that we do
my new wrap dress in this.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.584
Ugh, I love it.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.961
It will elevate the dress
to a higher price point.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.463
[Kim] Yeah, and listen,
with the extra money,

08:24.463 --> 08:26.506
- extra profit.
- Extra meals.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.591
So instead of the usual

08:27.591 --> 08:29.468
"Buy a dress,
serve four people,"

08:29.468 --> 08:32.054
when you buy this dress,
we can donate ten meals...

08:33.055 --> 08:34.348
To all of the new--

08:35.933 --> 08:37.601
I'm so sorry, Kim.
Just give me one second.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.394
My neighbor is having
a bit of an issue.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.688
- Angie.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.689
Hey hey hey.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.608
Angie, I'm on a work call.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.152
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
- It's fine.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.279
I just have to get
this new dress launched.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.031
- It won't be long.
- Girl, I don't get you.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.115
If I had your money,

08:52.115 --> 08:53.659
ooh, I would not work.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.703
Well, you don't work now,
so that tracks.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.038
Speaking of,

08:58.038 --> 09:00.874
what happened with
the Sheraton interview?

09:00.874 --> 09:03.210
Oh, girl.
No, yeah, I couldn't.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.878
I'm not really about that

09:04.878 --> 09:07.547
"hotel lounge singer" life.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.425
It feel more "last stop"
than "comeback," you feel me?

09:10.425 --> 09:13.053
Okay, but it paid money,
which you will need

09:13.053 --> 09:15.847
if you wanna move out
and get your own place someday.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.975
Girl, you would be lonely
without me here.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.936
Besides, if Gayle ever
got her own money,

09:20.936 --> 09:22.688
do you think Oprah
would be her bestie?

09:22.688 --> 09:26.191
One, Gayle has several jobs.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.735
And two, I promise
we will still be besties

09:28.735 --> 09:30.862
even if you do get a job.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.824
I just wanna help
in a way that actually helps.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.368
You living here was supposed
to support you for singing.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.828
But you stopped doing that.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.246
So who are you if you're just

09:39.246 --> 09:40.998
sitting around
on a couch all day

09:40.998 --> 09:42.249
talking about singing

09:42.249 --> 09:44.001
but not actually
ever really doing it?

09:45.377 --> 09:46.378
LaToya?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.255
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

09:48.255 --> 09:50.340
Girl, I'm still the same Angie

09:50.340 --> 09:51.925
that you know and love.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.927
You ain't gotta worry about me
changing up on you.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.847
- We are girls for life.
- And that's fine.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.266
I just wanna make sure
we're not roommates for life.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.310
I ain't mad
at the Golden Girls.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.604
And since we are giving out
professional advice,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.523
here's two cents for
your collection plate.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.025
Don't leave business calls
on hold

10:08.025 --> 10:09.192
to go and harass your roommate.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.695
Oh, shit. Kim?

10:11.695 --> 10:13.196
Kim!

10:13.196 --> 10:14.614
It's easy for her to say.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.200
Everything is easy for Quinn.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.535
Not true.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.786
I just know
whatever I do next,

10:19.786 --> 10:21.496
it has to be good.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.706
I mean, I had the record deal,

10:22.706 --> 10:25.167
nothing happened,
and then they dropped me.

10:25.167 --> 10:28.503
By the way, vegan ice cream
is some nasty bullshit.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.339
I actually like it.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.466
- Angie!
- It's nasty.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.968
Listen, it was one deal

10:34.968 --> 10:36.470
four years ago.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.097
Move on, start again.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.140
You're too good not to.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.392
When we were at NYU,

10:42.392 --> 10:44.353
that line used to be
around the block

10:44.353 --> 10:45.354
to hear you sing.

10:45.354 --> 10:46.563
Girl, yeah, and you hit 30,

10:46.563 --> 10:47.981
and "used to" starts sounding

10:47.981 --> 10:50.233
like a has-been bitch
who never made it.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.943
Stop it, no.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.987
No.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.490
Oh, no. Oh, my God, duck.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.616
What the fuck?

10:59.034 --> 11:00.452
Right there at
the end of the corner.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.745
My dude, what's up?

11:01.745 --> 11:05.082
- Is that--
- Holy shit.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.334
Ian.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.263
Take care of yourself.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.266
[crying softly]

11:32.776 --> 11:35.320
And the brother got a beard?
Still fine.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.073
Shit, I'd like to leave
some love crumbs in that.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.700
Angie.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.327
Sorry, inside thought.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.121
[Camille] He knows
this is my block.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.580
It should be a rule:
exes cannot walk

11:45.580 --> 11:46.790
on each other's blocks.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.125
Sweetie,
that would leave me a very,

11:48.125 --> 11:50.043
very small patch of the Bronx.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.169
Oh, my God.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.295
If he's visiting his mom

11:52.295 --> 11:53.672
that means
he's coming this way.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.173
Quick, before he sees us.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.508
[Angie] Oh, girl,
new shoes, new shoes,

11:56.508 --> 11:57.592
new shoes, new shoes.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.264
Slow down. I don't run!

12:02.264 --> 12:03.890
All right,
I'm on my way right now.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.518
God, I always knew
he would come back to you.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.520
Girl, you watch
way too much Hallmark.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.355
Only at Christmas.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.983
It was just weird.
Jarring, you know?

12:12.983 --> 12:14.693
I mean, since he ran away
to become a chef,

12:14.693 --> 12:16.236
I honestly haven't really
thought much about him.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.363
Girl, who the hell
are you kidding?

12:18.363 --> 12:19.823
Shh.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.408
It is a commercial
about coconut water.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.077
Turn your ass around.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.287
He looked good, too,

12:25.287 --> 12:27.539
and not just, like, Ian good
but, like,

12:27.539 --> 12:30.250
my next orgasm good.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.085
I'm not sure
how to take that.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.920
He probably got him
a nice little French Fry

12:33.920 --> 12:34.880
he keeping it tight for.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.381
No, she Black.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.134
Camille 2.0. Am I right?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.094
How would I--I don't know.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.888
And even if Ian
does have a girlfriend,

12:42.888 --> 12:45.348
which to be clear,
I don't care if he does,

12:45.348 --> 12:46.641
what does her race
have to do with anything?

12:46.641 --> 12:47.642
Kind of everything.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.894
If she's Black, be cool.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.145
You don't want that bad karma.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.313
But if she's white?

12:51.313 --> 12:52.814
Fair game, bitch.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.275
Stealing a Black man
from a white woman

12:55.275 --> 12:56.610
is not an act of treason.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.945
- It's an act of bravery.
[Camille] Well, whatever.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.072
How would I know
if Ian has a girl?

13:04.493 --> 13:05.494
Okay, fine.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.329
Yes, I cyberstalked his ass

13:07.329 --> 13:08.872
and I got nothing.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.582
How is he still not on
any social media?

13:11.374 --> 13:12.501
Be careful, Camille.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.085
Of what?

13:14.085 --> 13:15.795
I am the one who chose this.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.839
I am the one who ended things.
It's what I wanted.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.257
Yet you haven't
had a date since.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.593
You know what? It's--

13:21.593 --> 13:23.053
can we just change the subject?

13:23.053 --> 13:24.679
I'm taking
the last cheese stick.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.847
You ate the first one

13:25.847 --> 13:27.474
and the second one
and every other one,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.142
so why stop now?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.810
- Did you want?
- Nasty.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.521
And it's not like
he told me that he was,

13:32.521 --> 13:34.105
you know, back from
out of town or anything.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.690
So he obviously moved on too.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.692
Is this the
"change the subject" part?

13:37.692 --> 13:38.527
And it's fine.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.694
It's fine.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.988
It's fine because I'm Mosuo.
Mm-hmm.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.491
I was with him,
and I chose to move on.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.743
Yass. You know what?
Switch it up.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.994
That's what I'm doing.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.538
I thought about what
you said the other day

13:49.538 --> 13:51.081
about the kind of women
that I'm with.

13:51.081 --> 13:54.084
So I decided to ask out Shayla.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.002
Shayla?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.003
That sounds like
a stripper name.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.547
Like a daytime stripper name.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.090
Mm, like good morning,
gentlemen,

14:00.090 --> 14:01.841
enjoy your waffles as you
welcome to the pole,

14:01.841 --> 14:05.011
all: Shayla!

14:05.011 --> 14:07.681
Okay. Forget all y'all.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.350
Shayla is an investment banker.

14:10.350 --> 14:15.105
And she is very smart
and very stud.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.232
I'm impressed.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.401
- Ooh.
- Here we go.

14:19.401 --> 14:23.321
- Madea in 3D, y'all.
- Yes!

14:24.781 --> 14:26.116
Hello!

14:26.116 --> 14:27.117
[singer]

14:42.340 --> 14:44.342
[music stops]

14:45.677 --> 14:47.012
Hey, Malik.

14:47.012 --> 14:50.348
I dropped your class.
Effective immediately.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.100
I guess you really hated it.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.020
No, I loved it.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.396
But you can't date a student.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.897
Problem solved.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.232
[man over intercom]
Attention, Columbia students.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.525
do not use
the faculty lounge.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.862
Malik, hoping for a date
seems like an odd reason

15:03.862 --> 15:05.447
to adjust
your academic schedule.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.240
And yet,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.242
I am going to pick up
your phone,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.161
put my number in.

15:11.161 --> 15:14.289
Be in control.
Call me if you want.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.958
And I think you should want.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.631
[Angie] You are insane.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.715
How did you not take him

15:23.715 --> 15:25.050
in the locker room right there?

15:25.050 --> 15:26.926
Yeah, technically
I am free

15:26.926 --> 15:29.471
to date him now,
but he's too young.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.681
I'm not having sex
in the locker room.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.766
Don't knock it.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.977
- Hello.
- Okay?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.687
[hostess] Your table's ready.
Right this way.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.194
So they just gonna walk
on in here and get a table?

15:44.194 --> 15:45.862
Yeah, what the fuck
was that?

15:45.862 --> 15:47.238
That was the moment
this place started

15:47.238 --> 15:48.865
gentrifying on the inside.

15:48.865 --> 15:52.285
Girl, the Whole Foods
on 125th was the final nail.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.704
- Miss. Hi.
- Hi.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.247
We're here all the time

15:56.247 --> 15:57.499
and we've never
had to wait this long.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.459
Next table's yours.
Any minute now.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.587
Pick one, sweetie.
Which minute? Fifth? Tenth?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.339
Soon.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.674
Noel's, how may I help you?

16:05.674 --> 16:07.300
Oh, you pretending
to answer the phone?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.968
I know that move.
That's my move.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.637
Okay, inside voice,
inside voice.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.055
Ooh.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.015
We might have to go
somewhere else.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.935
I got another date
with Shayla later.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.396
Maybe dating a boss
is my speed.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.606
Ooh, so the first date
went well?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.400
Spectacular might be the word.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.484
- Spectacular?
- What?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.027
Uh-huh, she picked the place,

16:26.027 --> 16:27.153
she picked the wine,

16:27.153 --> 16:29.197
and for the first time
in my adult life,

16:29.197 --> 16:30.782
I did not pay.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.534
What?

16:32.534 --> 16:34.703
Well, I have a date too.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.792
Oh, come on, do you guys
not wanna hear about

16:40.792 --> 16:42.252
my latest Tinder-roni?

16:42.252 --> 16:43.878
Is it the dude
with the doll collection?

16:43.878 --> 16:45.255
Collectible action figures.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.091
Or that Bajan nigga
who stole your flat screen?

16:48.091 --> 16:49.300
- Unproven.
[Tye] He stole that shit.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.386
I literally caught
him walking out with it.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.096
Well, you know,
look on the bright side.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.347
He can take you on a date now,
'cause I'm pretty sure

16:54.347 --> 16:56.015
- he pawned it.
- [laughs]

16:56.015 --> 16:57.142
Okay, you know what?
Forget it.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.394
- Forget it.
- Okay, who-who is it?

16:59.394 --> 17:01.688
Thank you for asking,
Camille.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.567
- His name is Cory. 32.
- Mm.

17:05.567 --> 17:08.945
And a lawyer.
A working lawyer.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.613
- Mm.
- At a real firm.

17:10.613 --> 17:11.740
I checked this time.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.284
And here is the kicker.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.535
He lives on Long Island.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.454
Uh, that's far.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.372
Are we really
commuting for cock?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.373
[Tye] Mm-mm.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.459
Ladies,
we're ready for you now.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.002
Sure, she hears
the word "cock"

17:24.002 --> 17:25.670
and she comes running.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.340
- [laughter]
- I come running for it.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.176
[shrieks]

17:31.176 --> 17:33.887
Quinn! I thought about
what you said.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.389
I got a job. I'm singing.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.975
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.895
- The Sheraton?
- Girl, give that a rest, no.

17:41.895 --> 17:45.106
It's an open mic night
tomorrow.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.233
Oh.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.486
"Oh"?

17:49.486 --> 17:51.112
I'm singing for the first time

17:51.112 --> 17:53.990
in, like, a year, and "oh"?

17:53.990 --> 17:55.408
That better not be
the end of that sentence.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.368
That shit better be a fragment.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.454
No, no, I'm happy.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.872
I'm super happy.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.792
It's just not a, you know,
job-job.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.506
Oh, okay, thanks
for clearing that up.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.007
It's industry night

18:11.007 --> 18:12.675
so it could really
lead to something.

18:13.468 --> 18:16.763
Why the hell are you dressing
like a TJ Maxx Olivia Pope?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.431
Hey, it's my design,

18:18.431 --> 18:20.225
and I didn't mean
I'm not excited for you.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.810
[Angie] It's fine, whatever.

18:21.810 --> 18:24.187
You know, have a good train
ride to the Island of Long.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.564
- Or is it a flight out there?
- Ha-ha.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.858
Why are you going
all the way to Long Island?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.860
Make his ass come to you.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.654
He has to work until00.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.947
So it's easier
for me to go to him.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.783
Oh, so it's not
a date-date.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.159
Yes, it is.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.745
It is most definitely
a date-date, okay?

18:40.745 --> 18:42.747
It is a date-date-date.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.166
There's no such thing
as an00 date.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.419
Dates start at- 00 or- 00,
maybe- 00.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.755
But00 is fuck o'clock.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.632
Don't shit on my night
just 'cause I said

18:52.632 --> 18:54.217
that thing about the open mic.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.177
I just don't get how that's
better than getting paid.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.013
Singing for a bunch
of drunk tourists

18:59.013 --> 19:01.558
from wherever-the-fuck
at a Times Square Sheraton

19:01.558 --> 19:03.893
is not going
to lead to anything.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.313
I need more. I deserve more.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.066
This is for people who could
really offer me something.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.318
And I have to think long-term.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.486
I don't have a trust fund

19:13.486 --> 19:15.238
and parents supporting
my every move.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.618
No, you just use me for that.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.329
Use?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.497
You think I use you?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.207
I don't know, Angela.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.293
But enjoy my rent-free couch.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.669
Fuck that.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.046
And fuck that wack-ass outfit

19:32.046 --> 19:33.631
and this stiff shitty couch.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.425
You can find another
charity case

19:35.425 --> 19:36.885
to make you feel less guilty

19:36.885 --> 19:38.553
about your bougie bullshit.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.739
My train doesn't leave
for another

19:57.739 --> 19:58.740
two-and-a-half more hours

19:58.740 --> 20:00.825
but do not talk to me.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.744
[singer]

20:23.640 --> 20:24.974
Can I confess something?

20:27.018 --> 20:29.270
I don't usually date
other masc women.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.149
Me neither.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.651
You were a dare.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.321
You were an experiment.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.406
So is your experiment working?

20:41.032 --> 20:42.408
You trying to find out?

20:42.408 --> 20:45.495
[upbeat music]

20:54.087 --> 20:57.715
Uh, is loud music
a Long Island thing?

20:57.715 --> 20:58.925
Yeah, maybe.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.385
- I--I don't know.
- What--

21:00.385 --> 21:01.636
Hey, can I get
a Jack and Coke?

21:01.636 --> 21:03.471
What about your firm?

21:03.471 --> 21:06.599
Is there a lot of
upward mobility there?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.142
- Sure.
- It's funny because

21:08.142 --> 21:09.978
my father is actually--

21:09.978 --> 21:12.271
oh, my God! Shit.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.357
Do you see what you just did?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.236
This is wool crepe.

21:18.236 --> 21:19.821
Wool crepe!

21:20.488 --> 21:21.698
I'm--I'm sorry.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.492
I'm sorry, um--

21:24.492 --> 21:26.786
um, I'm gonna
go to the ladies' room.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.538
I'll be right back.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.298
Actually, would you mind
watching my purse for me?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.299
Oh, for sure.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.552
I will be right back.

Um, I'm sorry,

22:22.592 --> 22:25.011
have you seen my date
that was sitting right here?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.596
- Blue suit.
- Yeah.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.264
He said you'd settle up.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.224
I'm sorry, what?

22:30.224 --> 22:32.852
- He left?
- Yeah.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.895
He left?

22:33.895 --> 22:35.772
He left.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.815
Oh, my God, my purse.

22:37.815 --> 22:41.360
Oh, my God, excuse me, sir.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.154
Get up, get up.

Oh, my God.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.470
I am having the worst night
of my life.

I was just wondering,

23:08.846 --> 23:11.099
I'm trying to get on the
next train back to Manhattan.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.975
Is there any way you can
find it in your heart

23:12.975 --> 23:14.644
to give me $10?

23:14.644 --> 23:16.354
I get what's happening here.

23:16.354 --> 23:19.440
I say no, then you offer
your "services"

23:19.440 --> 23:21.025
so you can go buy some crack?

23:22.944 --> 23:26.948
I don't want crack, sir.

23:26.948 --> 23:29.033
I just wanna
get on the next train.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.618
Well, you must be smoking

'cause the next train
ain't coming until00 a.m.

I've been waiting
for this moment

23:50.847 --> 23:52.140
since you asked me out.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.599
Me too.

23:56.310 --> 23:59.939
Oh, yeah, put your face
all up in it.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.777
Ah, ah, get out.

Too much, too much, too much,
too much, hold on.

24:08.114 --> 24:11.033
- Like you running a feather.
- I got it.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.327
Uh-uh, I said a feather.

- Lighter, lighter, lighter.
- Okay.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.167
the truth is
we can never be Mosuo--"

"because we as women
paralyze ourselves

the consequences

if we did own our own power."

[Camille] Fuck it, I'm Mosuo.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.814
- I'm glad you called.
- Right, sure.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.399
Okay, wait.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.900
I just wanna lay
some ground rules

26:49.900 --> 26:51.736
so that you don't have
an unrealistic expectation

26:51.736 --> 26:53.237
- of what this is.
- Of course.

26:53.237 --> 26:56.365
I am just honoring
my Mosuo sisters.

26:56.365 --> 26:57.408
And I mean, because I'm not

26:57.408 --> 26:59.035
pressuring you into this,
right?

26:59.035 --> 27:00.619
- Nah, we good.
[Camille] Okay.

27:00.619 --> 27:04.248
Because I don't wanna get
"Me Too'd" or "He Too'd."

I still can't believe
I called you.

27:05.583 --> 27:06.625
I'm not sure
that I should have.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.960
I think maybe you should go.

You sure?

27:14.383 --> 27:16.302
Holy shit.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.803

27:17.803 --> 27:19.972
when it seemed like
the choice I made

27:19.972 --> 27:21.766
was exactly what I needed...

Okay, Professor.

something else,

28:48.686 --> 28:51.272
You keep
putting yourself out there.

28:51.272 --> 28:52.440
That takes way more strength

28:52.440 --> 28:54.191
than just sitting at home
and...

fucking strangers
on a friend's couch.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.573
That's a hypothetical, right?

29:02.116 --> 29:03.659
Sure.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.705
I can't believe you stayed
out here all night long.

Not so bougie after all.

that stuff.

Quinnie.

29:18.716 --> 29:20.801

that you got a gig

29:24.180 --> 29:26.390

to hear you sing.

I couldn't stay with her.

is too small.

to lick his ass?

"You know, he's not that young.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.237
This is okay."

30:21.237 --> 30:23.072
The next I'm looking down
the barrel of a bootyhole.

30:23.072 --> 30:24.073
Oh, no.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.574
What's the big deal?

30:25.574 --> 30:26.951
Dick, balls, ass,

30:26.951 --> 30:28.369
it's all the same neighborhood.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.662
Yo, you lick ass?

30:29.662 --> 30:30.788
Why not?

30:30.788 --> 30:32.706
I mean, even with
a freakishly long taint,

30:32.706 --> 30:34.291
you're still dick adjacent.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.459
No.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.586
Husbands do not ask
their future wives

30:37.586 --> 30:38.921
to lick their booties.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.256
That is my favorite
Bible verse.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.132
[laughter]

30:42.132 --> 30:44.176
I know it was a mistake,
but I thought it might

30:44.176 --> 30:45.886
help get Ian out of my head.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.013
Like a sexual palate cleanser.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.807
All right, I'm gonna need
another cocktail

30:49.807 --> 30:51.183
if I'm gonna finish
this conversation.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.852
Yes, just hurry,
'cause she's singing next.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.437
Oh, and get me one too.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.647
And tell him less ice.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.524
Hey, okay, bossy.

31:04.071 --> 31:09.410
[Camille] And in the end, yes,
here in 21st-century Harlem,

31:09.410 --> 31:12.162
we sisters
can be fierce Mosuo.

31:12.162 --> 31:16.417
Be in charge, call the shots,
get what we want.

31:21.505 --> 31:24.133
[Camille] But what if
what we want is to go back?

31:24.133 --> 31:26.719
[Angie]

31:26.719 --> 31:28.887
[Camille] When Mosuo think
they've made a mistake,

31:28.887 --> 31:31.432
is it better to try again?

31:31.432 --> 31:32.975
[Angie]

31:32.975 --> 31:34.310
[Camille] Or to look ahead?

31:34.310 --> 31:36.020
[Angie]

32:29.031 --> 32:30.532
[funky music]

32:30.532 --> 32:32.660
Oh, my God. Dr. Pruitt?

32:32.660 --> 32:33.952
I've read all three
of your books.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.579
If you need anything,
I'm your girl,

32:35.579 --> 32:36.914
'cause I've given up dating,

32:36.914 --> 32:38.791
and I really wanna
hone on in my career goals.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.835
- Can I call you back?
[man] That's fine, Dr. Pruitt.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.253
- I'll talk to you later.
- Sorry!

32:44.963 --> 32:47.549
This is not
how I pictured my life.

32:47.549 --> 32:48.967
Hi, Ian!
Ian, right?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.428
Hi, Ian.
Oh, Ian, what's up?

32:51.428 --> 32:52.596
Hey!

32:53.305 --> 32:54.890
[Angie] My producer,
he wants me

32:54.890 --> 32:55.891
to come to their offices
tomorrow.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.476
So what we doing?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.353
It's Get Out the musical.

32:59.353 --> 33:02.189
[all]

33:03.732 --> 33:05.818
What a casually dressed
surprise.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.569
- Quinn?
- Oh, that's right.

33:07.569 --> 33:08.904
You two know each other.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.739
Only from the entire year
that we dated, Mom.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.491
My Forbes interview

33:12.491 --> 33:14.993
has turned into
a two-page spread.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.829
I knew it!
Your dream is coming true!

33:16.829 --> 33:19.039
It's like the great Lady Gaga
once said,

33:19.039 --> 33:20.666
"You can get 99 no's--"

33:20.666 --> 33:22.042
I'ma stop you right there.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.001
both: Thank you.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.005
- And he's here.
- We should leave.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.006
- Go in.
- Go in?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.007
We'll just go in.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.259
No, no, no, no, no.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.677
- We should leave. Leave.
- We should leave.

33:32.386 --> 33:35.347
[Angie]

33:35.347 --> 33:38.350
'cause when I see you 1
