[Sir Malcolm] <i> Previously on</i> Penny Dreadful...

00:08.472 --> 00:10.939
[speaking demonic language]

00:11.842 --> 00:13.642
Words came to me blindly,
like an animal instinct.

00:13.677 --> 00:15.644
<i>I don't even know what I said.</i>

00:15.696 --> 00:17.563
You knew them? What are they?

00:17.615 --> 00:19.815
[Vanessa] <i> They're Nightcomers. Witches.</i>

00:19.817 --> 00:21.233
And your interest in Miss Ives?

00:21.318 --> 00:23.619
The wicked cunt is of no concern of yours!

00:23.654 --> 00:25.821
<i>Let her follow the bread crumbs to me.</i>

00:25.873 --> 00:27.623
Tell me where am I to find peace!

00:27.658 --> 00:29.208
<i>Not even my prayers are safe!</i>

00:29.243 --> 00:30.626
[Frankenstein] What are
we protecting her from?

00:30.661 --> 00:31.660
You can't help me!

00:31.712 --> 00:33.395
This is a battle I must fight on my own.

00:33.431 --> 00:36.582
[Evelyn] <i> My old friend
Miss Ives won't escape me.</i>

00:36.634 --> 00:39.418
<i>The Master won't be denied his prize.</i>

00:39.470 --> 00:41.103
Do you believe the past can return?

00:41.138 --> 00:42.171
Sister.

00:42.206 --> 00:44.506
[voice trembling] Help
me! Save me from him.

00:44.542 --> 00:45.974

[Sembene] <i> It never leaves
us. It is who we are.</i>

What is this?

02:48.688 --> 02:50.021
It's no concern of yours.

03:12.929 --> 03:14.128
[sighs]

03:15.932 --> 03:17.148
[whispers] Let me help you.

03:17.984 --> 03:19.684
Tell me what's going on.

03:22.022 --> 03:24.522
It's something I haven't told anyone.

03:25.225 --> 03:26.941
Then tell me.

03:41.541 --> 03:45.076
It all began several years ago

03:46.880 --> 03:48.246
and far from here.

03:49.716 --> 03:51.883
The moors of the West Country.

03:54.170 --> 03:57.255
I went in search of answers to who I was.

03:58.258 --> 04:00.091
To a woman

04:00.093 --> 04:03.594
I came to know as the
Cut-Wife of Ballentree Moor.

04:06.483 --> 04:08.599
She was the first witch I ever met.

04:10.904 --> 04:12.904

06:33.746 --> 06:34.745
[speaking demonic language]

06:44.557 --> 06:46.257
You can move now.

06:49.095 --> 06:50.328
You want me to kill your baby?

06:51.731 --> 06:52.997
What?

06:53.032 --> 06:54.065
No.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.933
You come for the love poultice then?

06:55.969 --> 06:58.369
You want a dandy man to be wooing you like.

06:58.404 --> 06:59.670
No.

07:00.406 --> 07:02.473
Then the ague? The head-stammers?

07:03.042 --> 07:04.909
The pain in your joints
when you take your man,

07:04.944 --> 07:06.143
or knell to the God?

07:06.179 --> 07:07.912
No, I...

07:07.947 --> 07:09.881
Why are you here?

07:09.916 --> 07:11.148
[sighs]

07:11.184 --> 07:12.583
You're not like them others.

07:13.553 --> 07:15.319
[whispers] I'm not.

07:16.022 --> 07:17.855
I'm like no others.

07:18.925 --> 07:22.193
I am like no others.

07:23.396 --> 07:24.662
That's why I'm here.

07:25.298 --> 07:27.565
I have a scar on my back.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.567
Tell me how I got it.

07:30.303 --> 07:31.602
Tell me.

07:32.438 --> 07:34.138
How am I to know?

07:34.173 --> 07:35.773
- [gasps]
- Right here.

07:36.526 --> 07:38.893
You go right here inside your mind.

07:38.945 --> 07:39.944
Close those eyes.

07:40.713 --> 07:43.514
You feel my spine through my fingers.

07:44.450 --> 07:45.983
Do this

07:45.985 --> 07:49.453
or turn around and take
your pretty cunt elsewheres.

07:49.489 --> 07:51.238
Do this, I tell you!

07:51.291 --> 07:52.990
[breathing shakily]

07:53.042 --> 07:54.792
That's it, girl.

07:54.827 --> 07:55.960
Good.

07:57.363 --> 07:59.497
You're strong-willed, and agile

08:01.501 --> 08:03.167
like the scorpion.

08:03.836 --> 08:06.337
Feel around my skull with your claws.

08:08.041 --> 08:09.740
Yes.

08:09.809 --> 08:11.709
Behind my eyes, you feel my bones

08:11.744 --> 08:13.144
- down my spine.
- Yes.

08:14.397 --> 08:16.263
Now feel out to my skin,

08:16.316 --> 08:19.100
to my past, to my pain.

08:19.152 --> 08:20.901
Yes.

08:20.937 --> 08:22.520
What do you feel?

08:22.572 --> 08:24.188
A woman.

08:25.191 --> 08:27.241
[whispers] Her nails on your back.

08:28.361 --> 08:31.529
No, no, not her nails.

08:31.581 --> 08:32.897
Hotter,

08:34.366 --> 08:35.700
- burning.
- Yes.

08:35.735 --> 08:38.586
Burning. Burning my skin!

08:38.621 --> 08:40.371
[groaning]

08:40.423 --> 08:42.340
[breathing shakily]

08:46.262 --> 08:48.045
[straining] A branding iron.

08:55.221 --> 08:57.555
You can enter now.

08:57.557 --> 09:00.191
Leave everything you
were outside this door.

09:00.226 --> 09:03.361
Everything you are, bring with you.

09:05.231 --> 09:07.148
[panting]

09:10.820 --> 09:12.403
[wind whooshing]

09:22.749 --> 09:24.248
[lock clicks]

09:27.837 --> 09:29.420
[bells tinkling]

09:35.094 --> 09:36.961
Clean that off your face.

09:36.996 --> 09:39.563
Makes you look like an animal.

09:39.599 --> 09:40.631
I know you been with a man

09:40.666 --> 09:43.601
so you're closer to the
beasts than the angels, yeah?

09:45.188 --> 09:47.321
Why are you on the moor?

09:47.356 --> 09:49.407
No one come here without
they want to see me.

09:49.442 --> 09:51.358
Unless you're a poacher,

09:52.078 --> 09:53.444
which you don't look.

09:53.446 --> 09:54.745
[ladle clatters]

09:56.916 --> 09:58.783
I came to see you.

10:01.454 --> 10:03.120
You can sit.

10:07.343 --> 10:08.876
[sighs]

10:12.849 --> 10:15.533
Even where I come from, we've heard of you.

10:15.568 --> 10:18.803
[chuckles] I'm famous, hear that?

10:19.305 --> 10:20.938
They say you have powers.

10:22.308 --> 10:24.742
What they call me, where you come from?

10:26.279 --> 10:28.612
The Cut-Wife of Ballentree Moor.

10:28.648 --> 10:30.481
You know why they call me that?

10:30.483 --> 10:31.532
Because when the girls

10:31.567 --> 10:33.534
need a little baby killed inside them,

10:33.569 --> 10:34.869
they come to me.

10:34.904 --> 10:37.822
I cut it out. Cut-Wife.

10:37.874 --> 10:38.989
Fetching name, you think?

10:39.709 --> 10:41.325
I don't think so.

10:41.327 --> 10:42.993
The local people come here

10:42.995 --> 10:44.762
only when they can't go no place else.

10:45.264 --> 10:46.764
They hate me for what I do.

10:46.799 --> 10:48.499
But they come for this,

10:49.469 --> 10:51.102
for that.

10:51.137 --> 10:53.337
For all that ails mankind, girl.

10:53.389 --> 10:56.607
My name is Vanessa Ives.

10:56.642 --> 10:58.943
We're not courting. I don't want your name.

10:58.978 --> 11:02.346
I came because I think you can tell me

11:02.398 --> 11:04.615
why I am like I am.

11:04.650 --> 11:06.684
And how's that? How you are?

11:08.521 --> 11:09.937
Cursed.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.358
[laughing]

11:15.077 --> 11:18.112
I believe I'm cursed to see things

11:20.199 --> 11:22.199
not of this world.

11:24.370 --> 11:27.505
I have a friend named Mina

11:27.540 --> 11:29.707
who reached out to me

11:29.759 --> 11:31.125
in my mind.

11:31.928 --> 11:33.260
I saw her,

11:35.047 --> 11:37.548
but she was not there.

11:39.552 --> 11:41.218
She needs my help.

11:42.355 --> 11:44.822
Then go find you a constable.

11:44.857 --> 11:48.058
Thee and me got nothing to talk about here.

11:49.562 --> 11:51.061
You want a salve for your heartache,

11:51.113 --> 11:52.780
I can give you that.

11:52.815 --> 11:54.398
You want herbs to ease the gout,

11:54.450 --> 11:55.566
I can give you that.

11:55.568 --> 11:57.368
You want to poison your baby brother,

11:57.403 --> 11:59.787
I can give you that,
and laugh while I do it!

11:59.822 --> 12:02.323
But if you think you
are touched by the demon

12:02.375 --> 12:04.325
then you best walk out that door.

12:04.410 --> 12:05.993
Because what I can give you for that

12:06.045 --> 12:08.629
is only knowledge you
don't want, little girl!

12:08.664 --> 12:10.130
Who branded you?

12:10.166 --> 12:11.582
[breathing heavily]

12:12.335 --> 12:13.884
Who did that to you?

12:15.788 --> 12:17.588
[whispers] Someone you loved.

12:20.393 --> 12:23.661
Someone you trusted.

12:24.063 --> 12:26.313
Someone you kissed once.

12:28.150 --> 12:29.233
A woman.

12:30.353 --> 12:31.335
A sister?

12:33.439 --> 12:34.688
Your sister.

12:39.946 --> 12:42.112
If I'm right, then let me stay.

13:05.304 --> 13:06.337
You want to learn?

13:08.858 --> 13:09.890
Yes.

13:09.942 --> 13:11.442
Everything?

13:11.477 --> 13:12.893
Yes.

13:12.979 --> 13:14.912
- You're not frightened?
- No.

13:14.947 --> 13:16.897
Why you want to learn the arts?

13:16.949 --> 13:18.949
To find out what I am.

13:18.985 --> 13:21.035
And if the answer you don't like?

13:21.070 --> 13:23.287
- Better to know.
- Not really.

13:23.322 --> 13:24.488
Look at them.

13:24.490 --> 13:26.040
What do they say to you?

13:27.877 --> 13:28.909
Nothing.

13:28.961 --> 13:29.994
[gasps]

13:30.830 --> 13:32.730
I said, look at them.

13:39.705 --> 13:42.239
What is your friend's name?

13:42.275 --> 13:44.074
Mina.

13:44.110 --> 13:45.743
Have you kissed her?

13:45.778 --> 13:47.011
Yes.

13:47.046 --> 13:48.345
Do you trust her?

13:48.381 --> 13:49.613
[sniffles] Yes.

13:49.649 --> 13:51.181
Would she do you harm?

13:51.183 --> 13:53.350
Never.

13:53.352 --> 13:55.352
- Feel her lips now.
- [sniffs]

13:55.354 --> 13:57.154
Feel her.

13:59.725 --> 14:02.526
Now put your hand over the cards, like so,

14:03.229 --> 14:04.862
just your fingers.

14:06.615 --> 14:07.698
[Vanessa sniffles]

14:07.700 --> 14:09.366
[Cut-Wife] Now let them move.

14:11.787 --> 14:13.170
Believe.

14:18.544 --> 14:19.877
[whispers] What do I do now?

14:19.912 --> 14:21.462
You'll know.

14:31.223 --> 14:32.556
[Vanessa] Do I turn it over?

14:33.976 --> 14:35.809
There's no need.

14:57.249 --> 14:58.999
There's stew in the pot.

14:59.919 --> 15:01.919
You can sleep on the sofa.

15:24.076 --> 15:26.276
[Cut-Wife] Casting the tarot is a gift.

15:26.328 --> 15:27.911
When you know the Arcana,

15:27.947 --> 15:30.647
you can hear the echoes
of time in your ear.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.617
- And the meaning?
- You'll learn.

15:34.703 --> 15:37.838
They are never always as they seem.

15:37.873 --> 15:39.957
The Devil card?

15:39.959 --> 15:41.842
Not always the demon from Hell

15:41.877 --> 15:43.961
or the throat slit at midnight.

15:43.963 --> 15:46.463
It can mean other things.

15:46.465 --> 15:47.931
Tell me what.

15:49.935 --> 15:51.468
- Evil.
- Do better!

15:57.109 --> 15:59.309
A dark lover approaching,

16:00.229 --> 16:01.395
bringing terror.

16:02.448 --> 16:03.480
Irresistible,

16:04.316 --> 16:06.283
part of you, but not.

16:07.319 --> 16:10.821
The whisper of something
ghastly and beautiful.

16:12.158 --> 16:13.757
That's more the feeling.

16:21.967 --> 16:24.168
Mandragora.

16:24.170 --> 16:26.470
Used to expel the stillborn baby,

16:26.505 --> 16:28.472
and bring sleeping terrors

16:28.507 --> 16:30.090
in the right amounts.

16:31.310 --> 16:33.727
<i>Solanum nigrum.</i> Nightshade botanical.

16:33.762 --> 16:35.145
Remember it.

16:40.019 --> 16:41.518
Were you born with the gift?

16:42.521 --> 16:45.489
I learned it. You were born with it.

16:46.775 --> 16:47.825
How do you know that?

16:48.744 --> 16:51.078
'Cause I see your pain, girl.

16:51.113 --> 16:52.863
You always been like you are.

16:52.865 --> 16:54.364
Even as a little thing.

16:54.366 --> 16:56.533
You know that.

16:56.585 --> 16:58.585
Come on, we got work.

16:58.621 --> 17:00.954
Old woman alone works hard.

17:01.006 --> 17:03.257
The peasants... [spits]

17:03.292 --> 17:05.175
... pay me little for my craft.

17:05.211 --> 17:07.211
Fuck them. Worse than animals.

17:11.851 --> 17:13.217
[exhales deeply]

17:23.061 --> 17:24.560
Break its neck.

17:32.821 --> 17:34.788
[rabbit squeaking]

17:41.914 --> 17:43.146
- [grunts]
- [neck snaps]

17:47.586 --> 17:48.719
[grunts]

17:51.006 --> 17:52.973
Put those on the shelves by their like.

17:53.008 --> 17:55.259
Keep the nightshades together, yeah?

17:56.762 --> 17:58.512
Tell me about your mother.

17:59.598 --> 18:02.065
No. I'll tell you.

18:03.319 --> 18:04.818
She's dead.

18:04.853 --> 18:06.937
But she was very much like you.

18:06.989 --> 18:08.522
Strong-willed.

18:08.574 --> 18:09.773
Imperious.

18:10.693 --> 18:13.610
Fucked other men, not your father.

18:13.662 --> 18:14.695
Yes.

18:15.781 --> 18:18.782
You saw them at it? Your
mother and these men.

18:19.451 --> 18:20.918
Did you like watching?

18:22.121 --> 18:23.537
- No.
- [snickers]

18:23.589 --> 18:24.705
You did.

18:24.757 --> 18:26.707
Your little secret gave you power, eh?

18:30.095 --> 18:31.361
You're in danger, you know that.

18:32.965 --> 18:34.715
You bring danger here, too.

18:35.551 --> 18:37.184
But I'm an old woman,

18:37.219 --> 18:39.803
for me, it brings spice to my last days,

18:39.855 --> 18:41.305
but for you...

18:43.208 --> 18:44.558
Give me the salt there.

18:44.610 --> 18:46.226
[breathes deeply]

18:50.950 --> 18:53.951
You have to learn to protect yourself.

18:53.986 --> 18:56.653
- From whom?
- Legions.

18:56.705 --> 18:58.071
Legions of what?

18:59.491 --> 19:02.075
So many names, I'd die
before I go through them all.

19:02.127 --> 19:03.694
Why don't you start with a few?

19:03.729 --> 19:05.062
- There's your mother's eyes.
- Stop it!

19:05.097 --> 19:06.496
But not when she died.

19:06.532 --> 19:09.299
Her eyes were different then, weren't they?

19:12.888 --> 19:14.004
You're a terrible woman.

19:14.006 --> 19:16.473
Not half so terrible as you.

19:17.726 --> 19:20.010
I knew it the first time I felt you,

19:20.062 --> 19:21.812
this danger.

19:21.847 --> 19:24.147
I wanted to scream and bolt the door,

19:24.183 --> 19:26.516
curl up in my little
bed and sleep and sleep.

19:26.518 --> 19:28.235
But you came closer.

19:29.071 --> 19:32.189
I felt you every step across the moor.

19:32.241 --> 19:34.491
They felt you, too.

19:34.526 --> 19:36.109
They'll be here soon.

19:36.862 --> 19:39.029
I felt you walking to my door.

19:39.031 --> 19:40.864
Felt you standing there.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.333
"By the pricking of my thumbs,

19:43.369 --> 19:46.286
something wicked this way comes."

19:53.595 --> 19:56.380
This girl you kissed, Mina.

19:56.432 --> 19:57.631
How you supposed to help her?

19:59.018 --> 20:01.151
I don't know. But she
appeared to me for a reason.

20:01.186 --> 20:03.120
Everything have a reason, does it?

20:03.689 --> 20:04.655
This did.

20:05.391 --> 20:06.723
You going to save her?

20:07.609 --> 20:08.642
Yes.

20:22.408 --> 20:23.740
[clattering]

20:25.244 --> 20:26.543
Stay here.

20:26.578 --> 20:29.413
Do not move from that seat, hear me?

20:40.959 --> 20:42.759
[door opening]

21:05.184 --> 21:06.316
Sister.

21:08.253 --> 21:09.519
Sister.

21:11.056 --> 21:12.622
How's your back?

21:12.658 --> 21:14.658
[Cut-Wife] Old wounds don't hurt.

21:14.693 --> 21:16.326
Don't they?

21:16.361 --> 21:17.894
Send her out.

21:17.930 --> 21:20.163
I am not in the giving vein.

21:20.199 --> 21:22.065
[Evelyn] When were you ever?

21:23.635 --> 21:25.235
[speaking demonic language]

21:30.175 --> 21:32.709
[speaking demonic language]

21:39.184 --> 21:41.518
I'm pleased you still
remember the old tongue.

21:41.553 --> 21:43.553
Once heard, never forgotten.

21:43.589 --> 21:44.988
But you're so very old.

21:45.057 --> 21:47.390
Isn't your mind slipping a bit?

21:47.426 --> 21:51.161
- And you are young as ever.
- Yes.

21:51.196 --> 21:52.796
That's rather the point.

21:52.831 --> 21:55.132
Give up your soul for that, sure.

21:55.167 --> 21:57.033
So with that you still live, eh?

21:57.069 --> 21:59.102
God, sister, how you speak.

21:59.138 --> 22:01.471
Like a talking potato.

22:01.507 --> 22:03.673
You never change.

22:03.675 --> 22:06.843
Except of course in every way that matters.

22:08.347 --> 22:11.097
Do send her out, don't be obstinate.

22:11.150 --> 22:14.017
There's still plenty of
flesh on you for burning.

22:14.069 --> 22:15.852
And why her so much?

22:18.273 --> 22:21.241
Because she's the one the
Master seeks above all.

22:22.361 --> 22:24.077
As you must have sensed,

22:25.030 --> 22:26.413
old woman.

22:28.066 --> 22:29.800
Now bring her to me.

22:31.370 --> 22:32.969
You cannot pass the stones.

22:33.005 --> 22:35.872
This we both know, so stand here

22:35.908 --> 22:37.541
until you rot!

22:37.576 --> 22:39.342
[both hissing]

22:39.378 --> 22:40.877
Why don't you come to me, then?

22:44.049 --> 22:45.715
Kiss me, sister,

22:45.717 --> 22:47.884
as we did in the old times.

22:48.554 --> 22:50.887
When we were a coven of sisters,

22:52.558 --> 22:54.808
coiled together like adders,

22:55.861 --> 22:58.995
like adders in the sands of Egypt,

22:59.031 --> 23:02.299
like hawks over Golgotha,

23:02.334 --> 23:04.467
like all things that come together

23:04.503 --> 23:06.169
and find strength as one.

23:06.205 --> 23:07.737
[breathing shakily]

23:07.773 --> 23:09.773
As it was before,

23:09.808 --> 23:14.311
when you too were young and smiled

23:14.346 --> 23:17.814
and had such dreams.

23:19.351 --> 23:23.086
Come to me, sister. Embrace me.

23:23.121 --> 23:25.455
The Master awaits you.

23:25.490 --> 23:27.424
He will kiss you

23:27.459 --> 23:30.010
and hold you fast,

23:30.062 --> 23:34.097
enfolding your body like a lover.

23:34.132 --> 23:35.365
[breath trembling]

23:36.935 --> 23:37.984
No!

23:38.070 --> 23:39.069
[shrieks]

23:40.272 --> 23:41.271
[gasps]

23:42.774 --> 23:44.991
Oh, she is wasted on you.

23:45.027 --> 23:46.359
[whispers] Give her to me.

23:46.411 --> 23:49.195
You have no power in the circle.

23:49.281 --> 23:50.547
You can't protect her forever.

23:51.516 --> 23:53.316
And how long can you last?

23:53.352 --> 23:54.951
Those bones are brittle.

23:54.987 --> 23:58.021
Do you really want this
to be your last battle?

23:59.591 --> 24:02.292
It is the only battle.

24:37.212 --> 24:38.912
My totems.

24:38.964 --> 24:41.081
For protection.

24:41.133 --> 24:42.832
- Do they work?
- Yes.

24:42.834 --> 24:45.168
But I can't remember which ones.

24:48.223 --> 24:49.839
[inhales deeply]

25:16.585 --> 25:18.201
Pretty, isn't it?

25:35.687 --> 25:37.420
We must prepare for battle.

25:38.790 --> 25:40.323
When it comes,

25:40.359 --> 25:43.960
it comes fully and to the end.

25:52.404 --> 25:54.204
[cows mooing]

26:02.748 --> 26:04.130
[grunting]

26:10.672 --> 26:12.505
[bellows]

26:25.103 --> 26:26.770
[whispers] Too much salt.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.780
Who were they?

26:36.865 --> 26:38.832
Who?

26:38.867 --> 26:40.617
You know who I mean.

26:45.874 --> 26:47.040
Nightcomers.

26:47.092 --> 26:48.291
Witches.

26:52.497 --> 26:55.899
My sister. My coven of yore.

26:58.103 --> 27:00.136
In these parts, away from the city,

27:01.606 --> 27:03.473
away from all things like that,

27:05.277 --> 27:07.060
we learn such things as we used to know

27:07.112 --> 27:08.278
when the Old Gods walked.

27:09.815 --> 27:11.531
We were Daywalkers then,

27:12.451 --> 27:14.868
harmless dabblers in herbs and healing.

27:16.872 --> 27:17.871
And then?

27:18.790 --> 27:20.406
My sister followed another path

27:20.459 --> 27:23.042
like the coven followed.

27:23.078 --> 27:25.044
I did not.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.329
So they cast me out,

27:26.331 --> 27:28.498
burned me as a traitor.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.834
They became those as walks at night,

27:30.886 --> 27:33.503
following the Devil for
what he promises them.

27:33.505 --> 27:35.638
Deceiver. Father of Beasts.

27:36.725 --> 27:38.808
What does he promise them?

27:38.844 --> 27:39.843
[thunder rumbling]

27:40.729 --> 27:42.512
What does everyone seek?

27:43.515 --> 27:45.932
Power, youth,

27:45.984 --> 27:47.450
beauty, love,

27:48.186 --> 27:49.385
to walk alongside,

27:49.421 --> 27:51.921
such as now, the great midnight arts.

27:52.824 --> 27:55.091
Those arts you know.

27:56.528 --> 27:59.462
All those sacred midnight things.

28:00.699 --> 28:02.332
- [knock on door]
- [gasps]

28:02.367 --> 28:03.750
Don't fret so, girl.

28:03.785 --> 28:05.251
They can't pass the stones.

28:05.787 --> 28:08.872
Only them that's full
humankind can do that.

28:13.145 --> 28:14.811
[thunder rumbling]

28:18.300 --> 28:20.133
You have a little baby you need cut, yeah?

28:20.185 --> 28:21.251
Mmm.

28:21.286 --> 28:22.752
What do you have for me?

28:28.193 --> 28:29.192
What else?

28:35.200 --> 28:36.232
Yeah, come in.

28:36.268 --> 28:37.901
You, go upstairs.

28:37.936 --> 28:40.203
No, I'll help.

28:43.408 --> 28:44.958
Get that tarpaulin in the corner

28:44.993 --> 28:45.992
and the bucket there.

28:48.914 --> 28:49.913
On the floor.

28:49.965 --> 28:51.381
[box closes]

28:54.586 --> 28:57.337
Was a sail on a ship long time ago.

28:57.389 --> 28:58.805
It's waxed for them storms,

28:58.840 --> 29:00.306
you know, at sea.

29:00.342 --> 29:02.225
Pull up your skirt and lie down.

29:06.648 --> 29:07.764
[whimpers softly]

29:08.733 --> 29:10.099
[breathing shakily]

29:11.102 --> 29:12.802
[Vanessa] What do you want me to do?

29:12.837 --> 29:14.637
- Get ready with the pot.
- [whimpers]

29:14.673 --> 29:16.406
- [sobbing]
- Be quiet!

29:16.441 --> 29:17.941
Think about this next time

29:17.993 --> 29:19.909
you let that dandy man
put his hand in your skirt.

29:21.079 --> 29:22.912
What will I do with you girls?

29:22.948 --> 29:24.280
What will I do with you girls?

29:24.282 --> 29:25.365
[shushing]

29:25.417 --> 29:26.849
[whispers] Look into my eyes.

29:27.502 --> 29:28.618
[sobbing]

29:28.620 --> 29:30.954
Just look at me. Don't look away.

29:32.958 --> 29:35.291
God forgives all.

29:41.132 --> 29:43.032
[screaming]

29:43.435 --> 29:45.018
[dogs barking]

29:48.556 --> 29:50.189
Beasts.

29:50.225 --> 29:52.809
Only hushed when they're at their feeding.

29:52.811 --> 29:54.777
Quiet them down!

29:56.114 --> 29:57.730
[sighs]

29:57.782 --> 30:00.984
You don't know how long I've
been trying to get the land.

30:00.986 --> 30:03.486
It's a homestead deed from Cromwell.

30:03.488 --> 30:04.954
Cromwell himself, I mean.

30:04.990 --> 30:06.406
Oh, I know who you mean.

30:07.292 --> 30:10.159
My darling, you own most of the county.

30:10.211 --> 30:12.462
Surely you can get that one woman out?

30:12.497 --> 30:13.496
Not by law.

30:13.548 --> 30:15.498
I've offered 10 times its worth.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.000
Old witch won't be moved.

30:19.337 --> 30:20.970
[dogs whimpering]

30:24.743 --> 30:26.592
It seems such a shame.

30:27.512 --> 30:29.595
For a man like you,

30:29.648 --> 30:30.813
a man of prestige,

30:30.849 --> 30:32.649
not to be able to graze his cattle

30:32.684 --> 30:33.983
to the river of his choice.

30:35.320 --> 30:37.520
Yes, seems a kind of weakness.

30:39.274 --> 30:41.124
I do not admire that.

30:41.159 --> 30:43.526
[chuckles] My dear,

30:44.529 --> 30:47.163
one piece of land means nothing to us.

30:47.949 --> 30:50.950
As far as your eye can see, it's mine.

30:52.203 --> 30:54.871
I suppose I'm something of a completist.

30:59.794 --> 31:02.211
[chuckles] It doesn't matter.

31:03.214 --> 31:04.764
Shall we ride?

31:06.518 --> 31:08.551
The grazing rights won't mean much anyway

31:08.553 --> 31:11.137
if the cattle keep dying.

31:11.189 --> 31:12.772
What do you mean?

31:13.525 --> 31:15.141
There's some sort of blight.

31:15.193 --> 31:17.310
The surgeons haven't a clue.

31:17.362 --> 31:19.729
Lost four head last night.

31:19.781 --> 31:22.115
Whole county'll be ruined if that keeps up.

31:22.150 --> 31:24.617
You'll figure something out.

31:24.652 --> 31:25.702
Darling?

31:25.737 --> 31:27.537
[dogs barking]

31:34.045 --> 31:35.878
[flies buzzing]

31:52.263 --> 31:54.680
[Vanessa speaking demonic language]

32:02.107 --> 32:05.074
[speaking demonic language]

32:13.952 --> 32:16.369
But you must remember such incantations

32:16.421 --> 32:17.920
are dangerous

32:17.956 --> 32:20.706
and you must never speak
the Devil's language idly.

32:21.626 --> 32:24.327
Let this language not
become easy in your mouth

32:24.362 --> 32:27.463
or soon it will no longer
be your mouth but his.

32:27.515 --> 32:29.632
And it will tell only lies.

32:30.769 --> 32:32.518
For he is the Father of Lies.

32:32.554 --> 32:33.686
If you believe in God,

32:33.721 --> 32:36.439
better you pray with all you got in you.

32:36.474 --> 32:37.974
Only if all else fails,

32:37.976 --> 32:39.392
you speak the Devil's tongue.

32:39.444 --> 32:40.777
But mark, girl,

32:40.812 --> 32:42.612
it's a seduction

32:42.647 --> 32:46.315
and before you blink twice
it's all you can speak,

32:46.317 --> 32:49.235
and so does a Daywalker
become a Nightcomer.

32:58.997 --> 33:01.330
Comfrey. Protection of travelers.

33:02.467 --> 33:03.499
How?

33:04.335 --> 33:07.670
Blanched and then crushed.
Hidden in the left pocket.

33:09.424 --> 33:10.640
[horse snorts]

33:10.675 --> 33:12.675
[carriage approaching]

33:22.237 --> 33:23.436
[spits]

33:30.945 --> 33:32.278
They send their girls to me,

33:32.330 --> 33:35.498
but for this very service they despise me.

33:35.533 --> 33:38.367
So it is always for those who do for women.

33:40.872 --> 33:42.922
Old as I am, I know nothing.

33:44.542 --> 33:47.376
Why people in this world
hate what is not them.

33:48.179 --> 33:50.546
Why they fear all they don't know.

33:51.266 --> 33:54.217
Why they hate themselves most of all.

33:54.269 --> 33:57.353
For being weak. For being old.

33:57.388 --> 33:58.604
For being everything altogether

33:58.640 --> 34:01.107
that is not God-like.

34:01.142 --> 34:02.808
Which of us can be that?

34:03.728 --> 34:05.895
Monsters all, are we not?

34:07.615 --> 34:09.815
Some perhaps more than others.

34:12.737 --> 34:14.620
Is that what you feel?

34:17.324 --> 34:18.623
Yes.

34:18.659 --> 34:19.976
Then it will be true,

34:20.011 --> 34:21.744
as long as you feel it so.

34:28.085 --> 34:30.219
[dogs howling]

34:35.760 --> 34:37.059
Get on your knees.

34:49.072 --> 34:51.440
Do not be ashamed of your desires.

34:53.695 --> 34:56.445
There is no pleasure,

34:56.496 --> 34:57.947
no degradation,

34:57.949 --> 34:59.832
I do not savor.

35:01.336 --> 35:02.785
Bow your head.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.672
Lower.

35:13.298 --> 35:14.847
- Mmm.
- Stop it.

35:16.551 --> 35:18.684
I shall tell you when you can speak.

35:20.104 --> 35:22.388
Until then you'll listen.

35:23.891 --> 35:24.974
Mute.

35:26.945 --> 35:28.227
Plaything.

35:29.814 --> 35:30.863
Toy.

35:32.450 --> 35:33.616
Slave.

35:34.485 --> 35:35.651
Beast.

35:36.571 --> 35:39.405
Fucking. Man.

35:40.725 --> 35:42.058
What would your vassals think,

35:42.093 --> 35:44.093
seeing you like this?

35:44.128 --> 35:45.995
Brought low and servile.

35:46.831 --> 35:50.333
Would they laugh? I think they would.

35:51.052 --> 35:53.502
So weak.

35:53.504 --> 35:55.805
Letting your cattle die,

35:55.840 --> 35:57.890
letting your estate die,

35:57.925 --> 36:01.010
while that old woman laughs at you.

36:01.062 --> 36:02.979
Can you hear her laughing?

36:03.014 --> 36:04.397
I can.

36:04.432 --> 36:05.781
[grunts]

36:06.351 --> 36:07.950
Such a superstitious lot,

36:09.020 --> 36:10.853
your neighbors.

36:10.905 --> 36:13.572
Those thick tenants working your land

36:13.608 --> 36:16.525
with their hands in
shit up to their elbows.

36:17.161 --> 36:19.245
But they can be led.

36:22.033 --> 36:24.617
And they can kneel, too.

36:26.204 --> 36:27.703
They were born to it.

36:28.706 --> 36:29.755
[screams]

36:30.375 --> 36:31.374
[groans]

36:32.043 --> 36:33.342
[groaning]

36:39.150 --> 36:40.216
[loud thud]

36:41.185 --> 36:43.052
[groaning]

36:47.942 --> 36:49.859
It was going to happen, girl.

36:49.894 --> 36:52.611
Sooner, later. But it's now.

36:53.948 --> 36:55.948
I've not had a happy life,

36:56.784 --> 36:58.200
but it has been my life.

36:58.236 --> 37:01.070
Let me get a doctor, please.

37:01.072 --> 37:03.506
For this ailment, there is no cure.

37:03.541 --> 37:05.741
Not the surgeon or the poultice.

37:05.777 --> 37:07.977
I have lived too long is my ailment.

37:08.012 --> 37:09.512
Nonsense. You're strong as a pirate.

37:09.547 --> 37:11.814
Then cast my tarot.

37:11.849 --> 37:12.815
[sighs]

37:13.551 --> 37:14.817
You already have.

37:15.953 --> 37:18.254
And did you not teach me that
the cards have many meanings?

37:18.306 --> 37:19.805
Don't be fresh.

37:21.559 --> 37:22.925
Get my pipe.

37:43.514 --> 37:44.780
I want you to stay here.

37:44.816 --> 37:46.449
What do you mean?

37:46.484 --> 37:49.151
I want you to live here after I'm gone.

37:49.187 --> 37:51.003
I make this your land.

37:52.673 --> 37:53.723
I can't.

37:53.758 --> 37:56.892
I have never known a
Daywalker with such power.

37:56.928 --> 37:58.094
And how will you use it?

37:58.129 --> 37:59.762
To help my friend Mina.

37:59.797 --> 38:02.098
One girl.

38:02.133 --> 38:05.101
Ballentree Moor is a poor, forgotten place,

38:05.136 --> 38:07.103
with many girls who need help.

38:07.138 --> 38:09.305
This place needs its Cut-Wife.

38:12.176 --> 38:13.375
Vanessa.

38:18.733 --> 38:20.199
[Minister] You mean Papistry?

38:20.234 --> 38:22.201
[Hawkes] I mean far worse than Rome.

38:22.236 --> 38:23.753
I mean sorcery.

38:23.788 --> 38:25.204
What proof do you have?

38:25.239 --> 38:27.656
What proof do you need beyond
the blight on the cattle?

38:27.658 --> 38:30.543
The very herds I want to
cross that bitch's land.

38:30.578 --> 38:32.044
You think this is mere happenstance?

38:32.079 --> 38:33.212
No.

38:33.247 --> 38:36.048
Those cattle die, this town dies.

38:36.083 --> 38:37.583
She is an evil woman.

38:37.635 --> 38:38.801
And you know what she does there?

38:38.836 --> 38:39.919
Mmm.

38:39.971 --> 38:41.337
The sanctity of life, sir.

38:41.339 --> 38:42.555
Yes.

38:42.590 --> 38:44.924
And is it necessary for me to remind you

38:44.976 --> 38:46.559
that your pastoral employment relies

38:46.594 --> 38:48.844
entirely upon my goodwill?

38:48.896 --> 38:50.613
As does the employment
of every blessed man,

38:50.648 --> 38:53.149
woman, and child in Ballentree.

38:53.217 --> 38:55.284
What you eat, I deign to give you.

38:56.788 --> 38:58.154
Sir Geoffrey.

38:58.189 --> 39:00.606
Come to the tavern tomorrow night.

39:00.658 --> 39:01.991
We've God's work to do.

39:05.696 --> 39:06.912
[sighs]

39:12.787 --> 39:14.286
[horse snorts]

39:22.930 --> 39:24.380
You're the little quim with the witch.

39:25.817 --> 39:27.550
I've heard about you.

39:28.769 --> 39:30.753
She didn't tell me you were so pretty.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.892
[gasps]

39:36.944 --> 39:38.527
Answer me, girl.

39:39.897 --> 39:41.230
Do you know who I am?

39:42.233 --> 39:43.866
This is my land.

39:45.319 --> 39:46.952
That makes you a poacher.

39:48.206 --> 39:50.706
I could have you branded right there.

39:52.076 --> 39:54.577
We do such things here.

39:54.629 --> 39:55.961
We do such things

39:55.997 --> 39:57.746
as you never could imagine.

39:58.749 --> 39:59.965
Eh, girl?

40:02.253 --> 40:03.586
Quiet, girl.

40:05.756 --> 40:07.139
Quiet, girl.

40:07.925 --> 40:09.091
Quiet, girl.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.594
Maybe I'll make you scream.

40:12.430 --> 40:13.846
- [grunts]
- [screams]

40:15.349 --> 40:16.732
[grunting]

40:16.767 --> 40:18.067
[grunting]

40:23.357 --> 40:24.523
Scream for me.

40:27.161 --> 40:29.945
Go on, child. Scream for me.

40:32.950 --> 40:35.117
[screaming]

40:36.837 --> 40:39.255
Come not near me or mine again, eh?

40:56.107 --> 41:00.192
May the angels bless the
Lord Protector, Mr. Cromwell.

41:00.227 --> 41:02.528
Granted the land to me in perpetuity.

41:03.481 --> 41:05.481
Not even the
high-and-mighty Sir Geoffrey

41:05.483 --> 41:07.650
can steal it off me.

41:07.652 --> 41:09.652
Long as Parliament sits,

41:09.704 --> 41:11.704
this pile of dung is mine.

41:13.190 --> 41:15.240
When you say he granted it to you...

41:15.293 --> 41:16.625
To me, girl.

41:16.661 --> 41:19.912
After the second battle
of Newbury this was.

41:19.964 --> 41:23.382
He was on the run. I gave him succor here,

41:23.417 --> 41:25.200
having no love of the Royalists,

41:25.236 --> 41:29.271
for they had none for us
poor folk or women folk.

41:29.307 --> 41:32.441
[chuckles] Ugly man really.

41:33.978 --> 41:35.744
Big warts on his face.

41:37.014 --> 41:38.681
What year was this?

41:38.716 --> 41:41.550
As I recall, 1644.

41:47.224 --> 41:48.490
[grunts]

41:48.526 --> 41:50.359
You must eat.

41:50.394 --> 41:52.561
I must do nothing but die.

41:54.198 --> 41:56.932
I'm overdue for that, my Little Scorpion.

42:00.171 --> 42:02.438
Have you thought about what I said?

42:02.473 --> 42:03.572
Staying here?

42:03.607 --> 42:04.640
Yes.

42:05.409 --> 42:08.477
And are you set for
London to help your friend?

42:09.213 --> 42:10.479
I don't know.

42:11.215 --> 42:12.481
But I'll wait.

42:12.550 --> 42:13.716
Until I'm dead?

42:13.751 --> 42:15.017
Yes.

42:17.304 --> 42:18.554
Truly, I don't know

42:18.606 --> 42:20.723
if your heart is good or bad.

42:22.393 --> 42:24.727
But I have to show you something.

42:26.630 --> 42:27.930
See that big book?

42:28.899 --> 42:30.566
With the glyph on the side?

42:31.285 --> 42:32.651
Bring it me.

42:44.081 --> 42:46.915
Of all the texts, of all the spells,

42:48.452 --> 42:50.386
this is the most cursed.

42:51.555 --> 42:53.188
What is it?

42:53.224 --> 42:56.859
Forbidden. The Poetry of Death.

42:58.829 --> 43:00.662
If ever the day comes

43:00.698 --> 43:03.699
when my Little Scorpion
is crushed and beaten,

43:03.734 --> 43:06.869
if her God deserts her completely,

43:06.904 --> 43:08.771
only then does she open it.

43:10.241 --> 43:13.776
And on that day she will never be the same.

43:14.678 --> 43:18.313
She will have gone away from God, forever.

43:23.187 --> 43:24.586
[horse neighing distantly]

43:28.375 --> 43:29.758
Poor animal.

43:31.128 --> 43:33.295
They become trapped in
the mire, can't get out.

43:34.598 --> 43:36.465
They struggle,

43:36.500 --> 43:39.234
and the more they struggle,
the faster they sink.

43:40.638 --> 43:43.372
One wrong step is all it takes.

43:46.911 --> 43:48.243
For us all.

43:49.380 --> 43:50.746
For us all.

43:56.904 --> 43:59.154
Then may the Lord God bring us safe footing

43:59.206 --> 44:00.989
until we're home.

44:02.493 --> 44:03.826
Better still,

44:05.329 --> 44:07.963
may He let us know when we are home.

44:11.836 --> 44:15.053
Now put this cursed thing
back and bring me my box.

44:24.932 --> 44:28.450
And God tells us our duty in Leviticus,

44:28.486 --> 44:30.486
"A man or a woman

44:30.521 --> 44:33.155
who is a medium or a necromancer

44:33.190 --> 44:34.790
shall surely be put to death."

44:34.825 --> 44:36.325
[all] Aye!

44:36.360 --> 44:38.243
"They shall be stoned with stones... "

44:38.279 --> 44:39.361
[all] Aye!

44:39.363 --> 44:40.696
"Their blood shall be upon them."

44:40.698 --> 44:42.064
[all] Aye!

44:42.867 --> 44:45.200
Will I picture you a future, lads?

44:46.837 --> 44:50.038
That woman, unchecked,
leads to my ruination.

44:50.774 --> 44:53.108
I'll have no choice but to close the manor

44:53.144 --> 44:55.244
and find me better grazing land eastward.

44:56.380 --> 44:58.080
What'll happen to you then, Jack?

44:59.266 --> 45:01.133
- [stutters] We sell off.
- And who's to buy?

45:01.602 --> 45:04.052
Who's to buy any of it, Jack? Spencer?

45:05.022 --> 45:06.155
Hugh Martin? Gil Taylor?

45:06.774 --> 45:07.973
Tell me who will buy your land?

45:08.025 --> 45:10.726
This dead land where nothing will graze?

45:12.029 --> 45:14.696
You'll be properly like
the bloody Irish then,

45:14.732 --> 45:16.765
digging out spuds with your fingernails,

45:16.800 --> 45:18.901
starving day by day while
your little ones die afore you.

45:18.903 --> 45:19.985
[all] Aye!

45:23.407 --> 45:24.506
Fill their tankards now.

45:24.542 --> 45:25.707
[all cheering]

45:32.583 --> 45:35.334
[Hawkes] <i> So we ask you
this, the Minister and me.</i>

45:35.386 --> 45:37.753
What do we do when there's
a battle needs fighting?

45:37.755 --> 45:39.588
When our homeland is invaded?

45:39.640 --> 45:41.623
- We fight!
- [all agreeing]

45:41.659 --> 45:44.359
We fight! Like the good
Devon men and ladies we are.

45:44.395 --> 45:45.694
- [Man] Yes!
- We fought the Norse,

45:45.729 --> 45:47.696
the Romans and the
Roundheads, didn't we, then?

45:47.731 --> 45:48.730
[all] Yes!

45:49.266 --> 45:51.850
There will be something for you in here.

45:51.902 --> 45:54.603
After I'm gone, you understand?

45:56.840 --> 45:58.240
- We take up the pikes...
- [all] Aye!

45:58.275 --> 45:59.374
and the shovels and the cleavers

45:59.410 --> 46:00.442
as we did before,

46:00.477 --> 46:01.843
like we learned from our fathers,

46:01.879 --> 46:02.911
and we fight for what is ours!

46:02.947 --> 46:04.012
[all] Aye!

46:04.048 --> 46:05.697
Drink up, lads! Drink up!

46:06.884 --> 46:08.083
Now go.

46:14.325 --> 46:16.041
[breathing heavily]

46:16.961 --> 46:18.126
Burn the witch!

46:18.712 --> 46:20.712
[all] Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

46:22.132 --> 46:24.883
<i>Burn the witch! Burn the witch!</i>

46:25.970 --> 46:28.804
[chanting] Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

46:38.616 --> 46:39.615
[Cut-Wife] <i> When do you go?</i>

46:41.952 --> 46:43.118
After.

46:46.323 --> 46:48.490
I won't pretend I'm not sorry.

46:49.827 --> 46:52.160
- I can come back.
- You won't.

46:52.162 --> 46:53.996
You're a selfish girl.

46:54.715 --> 46:57.249
Too many books you have in your head.

46:58.085 --> 46:59.918
You think you're going to be a hero.

46:59.970 --> 47:02.170
You are not! None of us are!

47:03.257 --> 47:04.556
I think I'm nothing but a woman

47:04.591 --> 47:05.974
who must do something.

47:06.010 --> 47:07.592
So you can sleep at night!

47:07.645 --> 47:10.395
Fuck your sleep, you selfish bitch!

47:10.431 --> 47:12.731
May you never pass a happy night!

47:20.557 --> 47:22.524
[horse neighing distantly]

47:30.234 --> 47:31.450
[whispers] Oh, my God.

47:31.502 --> 47:32.868
Help me up.

47:32.920 --> 47:35.837
- No! We must...
- I will meet them on my feet!

47:36.957 --> 47:39.591
Stay inside when I go.

47:39.626 --> 47:41.209
Lock the door.

47:41.261 --> 47:43.378
No, I will walk with you.

47:52.723 --> 47:54.306
Now you watch yourself close,

47:54.358 --> 47:56.858
my Little Scorpion.

47:56.894 --> 47:59.478
And remember this I speak now, eh?

48:01.448 --> 48:04.733
When Lucifer fell, he did not fall alone.

48:05.652 --> 48:08.737
They will hunt you until the end of days.

48:11.492 --> 48:12.741
Be true.

48:18.832 --> 48:21.666
My name is Joan Clayton.

49:05.345 --> 49:08.296
We have resolved you to
be guilty of necromancy

49:09.466 --> 49:11.683
and being in league with
your Master, the Devil.

49:13.187 --> 49:15.971
As it was before in God's own time,

49:15.973 --> 49:17.606
let it be so now.

49:25.849 --> 49:27.115
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

49:27.151 --> 49:28.533
[men shouting indistinctly]

49:28.569 --> 49:30.152
[Vanessa] No!

49:30.154 --> 49:31.403
[All] Burn the witch!

49:31.455 --> 49:33.155
No! No!

49:33.207 --> 49:34.706
[Joan groaning]

49:35.826 --> 49:37.325
[Vanessa] No!

49:40.080 --> 49:41.163
[grunts]

49:41.165 --> 49:42.497
No!

49:42.499 --> 49:43.799
[crowd clamoring]

49:46.470 --> 49:48.003
[grunts]

49:59.016 --> 50:00.982
[grunting]

50:03.904 --> 50:05.070
[gasps]

50:55.906 --> 50:57.739
[gasps]

51:58.468 --> 51:59.634
[grunts]

52:17.621 --> 52:19.287
[grunting]

52:21.408 --> 52:23.208
- [cloth ripping]
- [gasps]

52:23.243 --> 52:24.993
[softly] Go on, child.

52:25.912 --> 52:27.379
Scream for me.

52:34.304 --> 52:36.221
[groaning]

52:47.517 --> 52:49.317
[crying]

53:02.032 --> 53:04.032
[breathing heavily]

53:04.868 --> 53:06.451
[groaning]

53:11.008 --> 53:13.041
[straining]

53:16.546 --> 53:18.296
[breathing heavily]

53:26.723 --> 53:28.690
[groaning]

56:22.899 --> 56:23.898
[grunts softly]

56:58.101 --> 57:01.569
[Joan] <i> When Lucifer fell,
he did not fall alone.</i>

57:03.573 --> 57:07.275
<i>They will hunt you until the end of days.</i>

57:10.580 --> 57:11.946
<i>Be true.</i>
