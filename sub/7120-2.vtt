WEBVTT

00:11.906 --> 00:13.876
Man, why am I so sleepy?

00:14.150 --> 00:16.717
Dude, we've been up
for like seven days.

00:17.819 --> 00:18.757
For real-sies?

00:19.044 --> 00:20.306
Yeah, for real-sies!

00:21.323 --> 00:26.285
Remember? First, we saved the Slime
Princess from the Ghost-Ship Vortex.

00:27.711 --> 00:29.879
And then we slayed that fire dragon.

00:31.442 --> 00:32.917
And that took a couple of days.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.965
Then we went to LSP's quinceañera.

00:35.090 --> 00:37.396
Oh, no way. You guys made it!

00:37.765 --> 00:40.040
Helped Peppermint Butler
with his Goblin problem.

00:40.334 --> 00:43.728
I swear that i found it like this.
I don't know what happened.

00:43.853 --> 00:45.636
We'll take care of it,
Peppermint Butler.

00:46.034 --> 00:49.189
Saved Wildberry Princess
from the Ice King.

00:49.314 --> 00:51.316
I just wanna be happy!

00:51.709 --> 00:54.477
- Then, we captured that Bandito.
- Thanks, you guys.

00:54.643 --> 00:55.896
Saved the house...

00:56.183 --> 00:57.197
Thanks, you guys.

00:57.465 --> 00:58.865
And fed that duck.

01:02.174 --> 01:03.424
We've had a busy week.

01:03.694 --> 01:05.197
I'm exhausted. But happy!

01:06.722 --> 01:08.797
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night!

01:09.219 --> 01:11.682
That's right, Finn.
Adventure'til you drop.

01:22.323 --> 01:23.157
Yeah?

01:23.323 --> 01:25.317
- Can you sleep?
- No.

01:25.578 --> 01:28.297
- I can't sleep either.
- Yeah, what's going on with that?

01:28.422 --> 01:29.628
I don't know. But...

01:30.284 --> 01:32.190
I've got the strangest feeling...

01:33.247 --> 01:34.753
That we're being watched.

01:39.102 --> 01:40.915
Why is that horse staring at us?

01:48.009 --> 01:49.209
That's super creepy.

01:49.503 --> 01:51.134
Man, I just wanna go to sleep.

01:51.384 --> 01:52.917
Well, maybe he's gone.

01:57.178 --> 01:59.665
Not gonna be able to sleep
with that horse watchin' me.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.677
Let's just close the shade.

02:03.815 --> 02:06.534
- Outta sight and outta mind.
- Good work, Jake.

02:06.659 --> 02:07.997
See ya in the morning, pal.

02:23.205 --> 02:24.957
Why won't it stop?!

02:25.788 --> 02:27.080
All right, man.

02:28.612 --> 02:29.638
Let's just go...

02:29.763 --> 02:31.538
Push it off that hill or something.

02:31.663 --> 02:35.219
Maybe we can just...
Um... Politely ask it to leave.

02:35.483 --> 02:36.484
Sure, man.

02:39.862 --> 02:41.488
Hey! Get out of here, horse!

02:41.613 --> 02:43.917
I want to go to sleep, and
you're creeping me the math out!

02:45.075 --> 02:47.356
Let me try. Diplomat style.

02:47.662 --> 02:52.538
Pardon me horse, I beseech thou
to split my land, this night.

02:52.663 --> 02:56.236
But I will meet to come back
for some luncheth, some other day.

03:01.262 --> 03:04.426
Forget it, man. This horse is whack.
It's got poo-brain.

03:04.551 --> 03:08.301
Okay, you're right.
We can try pushing it now.

03:10.639 --> 03:11.701
Move, horsey!

03:13.561 --> 03:15.877
Good Grod, Jake!
Are you even pulling?

03:16.695 --> 03:18.076
I'm super-pulling!

03:18.395 --> 03:20.276
This horse has a ridiculous weight!

03:24.482 --> 03:27.370
Math this.
What now, man?

03:28.044 --> 03:30.550
I don't want use my
powers on you, horse,

03:30.675 --> 03:31.996
because I'm so sleepy.

03:32.226 --> 03:34.401
But you've pushed Jake too far!

03:40.306 --> 03:42.507
Shouldn't be able to creepin' us
out from way over there!

03:42.632 --> 03:44.437
Let's get back to bed, buddy.

03:44.664 --> 03:46.917
Oh yeah, I'm so ready for bed.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.677
I wanna marry my bed.

03:49.007 --> 03:50.301
Me too!

03:53.882 --> 03:55.556
No more...

03:56.006 --> 03:56.888
No more!

03:57.013 --> 03:59.360
- Where are you going?
- I have an idea!

04:03.137 --> 04:04.733
I did it!

04:04.858 --> 04:06.836
He can't stare at us if he's blind!

04:07.169 --> 04:08.077
Look, man.

04:09.213 --> 04:10.513
Why?

04:11.482 --> 04:12.517
Stupid blindfold!

04:14.064 --> 04:17.370
What's your deal, screwy?
Why are you messin' with us, huh?

04:18.370 --> 04:19.875
That horse is whack with poo-brain.

04:20.152 --> 04:21.452
Yeah, I know, Finn.

04:21.577 --> 04:24.957
I diagnosed this horse with whacked out
poo-brain five minutes ago.

04:25.295 --> 04:28.790
Dude, poo-brain means that we can
lure it away from here using music.

04:28.915 --> 04:30.596
Everything brainless likes music.

04:30.845 --> 04:32.839
That's true! You're a genius!

04:35.396 --> 04:37.917
All right horse,
prepare to get lured!

04:40.590 --> 04:41.977
Follow me, Horsie.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.952
Jake? It's not luring!

04:48.827 --> 04:52.540
So, Beethoven is not luring
enough for you, is it?

04:52.665 --> 04:54.896
Well, how about some...
Mozart?

05:03.082 --> 05:05.538
You're luring snakes! Stop!

05:06.121 --> 05:09.407
Huh? Oh, nuts. Let me try
and lure a mongoose!

05:10.727 --> 05:11.870
Stop man!

05:15.158 --> 05:18.317
- Dude... Let's kill the horse.
- What?

05:18.595 --> 05:20.352
I'm so tired, Finn!

05:20.477 --> 05:22.265
No, man, we're not killing the horse.

05:22.527 --> 05:24.316
Okay, we won't kill the horse.

05:24.677 --> 05:26.745
We'll dress him up like a bunny!
Haha!

05:26.870 --> 05:30.157
And get a giant hawk.
To kill him!

05:33.470 --> 05:35.271
No, man! That is wrong.

05:37.077 --> 05:38.917
Did I say the hawk would kill him?

05:39.258 --> 05:41.083
I meant that the hawk
would swoop down gently

05:41.208 --> 05:43.164
and take him away
to an island of sunshine

05:43.289 --> 05:44.917
and love-stuff and take care of him.

05:45.171 --> 05:47.696
Whoa. That sounds awesome.

05:50.008 --> 05:52.037
- What do think?
- It looks like a bunny?

05:53.871 --> 05:55.437
Hey hawks, c'mon!

06:00.945 --> 06:02.996
Jake... I think I see a hawk or two.

06:06.064 --> 06:08.564
Cause more commotion
to help the hawks!

06:13.924 --> 06:14.970
Take the bunny!

06:15.569 --> 06:16.877
Right here!

06:19.088 --> 06:20.351
- Right here!
- Here!

06:22.170 --> 06:23.776
Hold him and fly away!

06:27.719 --> 06:29.117
The bunny! The bunny!

06:38.094 --> 06:39.556
What a beautiful sight.

06:39.926 --> 06:41.117
We did it!

06:41.514 --> 06:42.477
Back to sleep!

06:47.456 --> 06:48.508
Good night, buddy.

06:48.633 --> 06:50.033
Good night, buddy.

06:51.803 --> 06:53.436
Ahh! It's in our house now!

06:53.683 --> 06:56.796
That's obvious, Finn! You don't
have to say that out loud!

06:56.963 --> 06:58.716
Hey, this is all your fault, dude!

06:58.951 --> 07:02.197
If you weren't so darn handsome, animals
wouldn't always be staring at you!

07:02.520 --> 07:04.226
You're just mad at me for being...

07:04.351 --> 07:05.277
Handsome?

07:05.539 --> 07:08.064
Yeah, well, you're the one who
told me to lure snakes!

07:09.494 --> 07:12.957
I told you to lure the horse!
You lured the snakes!

07:13.282 --> 07:15.208
There's even one here
in my underpants!

07:16.964 --> 07:18.464
Wait a minute, dude.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.695
Can you see what this horse is doing?

07:22.351 --> 07:23.707
It's tearing us apart.

07:23.832 --> 07:25.232
Aw, man... You're right!

07:25.464 --> 07:28.101
We have to get rid of
this horse - for us!

07:28.226 --> 07:29.997
I know, bro.
I know.

07:30.326 --> 07:34.095
Oh, Finn, this horse is
bringing us together now.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.036
This horse is a blessing.

07:36.203 --> 07:38.237
What? Dude, you've lost it!

07:38.520 --> 07:41.796
You... Wait, wait.

07:42.988 --> 07:45.637
The horse is tearing us apart again!

07:45.980 --> 07:46.911
You're right!

07:47.036 --> 07:50.211
It's about the time that I show
this horse... Who's the man.

07:50.823 --> 07:53.637
- What are you going to do?
- Say that to me again.

07:53.893 --> 07:56.156
What are you going to do?!

07:58.563 --> 08:00.957
I'm going to kick
that horse in the bottom!

08:01.123 --> 08:02.412
Oh, my Grod!

08:09.563 --> 08:10.997
The Ice King?

08:11.824 --> 08:12.825
I should go.

08:13.323 --> 08:16.117
- You were spying on us?
- That's none of your business!

08:16.379 --> 08:18.556
He was trying to learn
our bedtime secrets!

08:18.681 --> 08:20.077
Were you?

08:22.461 --> 08:26.036
He was! Did you find out
that I sleep "in the nude"?

08:28.711 --> 08:31.524
It's none of your business
how nude I sleep, Ice King!

08:31.649 --> 08:33.676
None of your business!

08:33.962 --> 08:36.231
Gentlemen.
I'll see you later.

08:42.942 --> 08:44.957
- Here's your sword, dude!
- Thank you.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.935
Jake! Jake! Look out!

08:55.774 --> 08:57.557
Tell us why you were spying!

09:01.193 --> 09:02.486
Snakes!

09:02.905 --> 09:04.898
Quick! Throw them to the Ice King.

09:10.812 --> 09:12.267
What's he doing?

09:12.392 --> 09:14.876
He's using his ice powers!

09:21.804 --> 09:23.459
Is that all the ice you have?

09:24.452 --> 09:25.259
Yes.

09:25.384 --> 09:28.322
Well, you should really have... More!

09:28.447 --> 09:29.965
Well, we don't need anymore.

09:30.090 --> 09:31.871
What if you had guests?

09:31.996 --> 09:33.557
Guests bring their own ice!

09:36.444 --> 09:38.288
Tell us why you were
spying on us or we'll...

09:38.413 --> 09:40.215
We'll cut off your stupid head!

09:40.340 --> 09:43.528
Yeah, and make it quick cause
we're both really sleepy.

09:43.653 --> 09:46.159
OK, OK. I'll tell you.
I was watching you...

09:47.027 --> 09:48.797
... To learn how to be happy.

09:49.183 --> 09:49.997
What?

09:50.497 --> 09:54.153
It's true! I would like to be
happy like you guys.

09:54.278 --> 09:56.159
But, I have no idea how.

09:56.284 --> 09:58.284
So, you dressed up like a horse?

09:58.697 --> 09:59.941
Have pity on me.

10:00.365 --> 10:03.953
I've been so sad and
miserable, I cry all the time.

10:04.221 --> 10:08.083
But, whenever I see you two,
you always look so happy.

10:08.584 --> 10:11.476
But, they're just hopping each other.

10:11.697 --> 10:15.596
So yes, I've decided to spy on you,
dressed as a horse.

10:15.763 --> 10:17.873
But... I guess my plan failed.

10:17.998 --> 10:21.129
All I observed was you
two arguing over...

10:21.435 --> 10:22.804
How to get rid of me.

10:26.164 --> 10:28.248
Hey, are you sleeping?

10:29.473 --> 10:32.060
Is this it?

10:32.922 --> 10:33.953
Sleeping?

10:34.423 --> 10:38.023
Could it be that all I need is
a good night's rest?

10:43.531 --> 10:45.450
I'm... Still not happy.
