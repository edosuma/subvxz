* *

00:09.676 --> 00:10.885
[door clicks]

00:10.927 --> 00:13.888
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.224
Just give me two
seconds to get out

00:16.266 --> 00:18.101
my notebook
for the handoff status report,

00:18.143 --> 00:19.644
and I'll get you on your way.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.438
- Julia, you may
keep your notebook

00:21.479 --> 00:25.358
very deep in that body bag
of a satchel you have there.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.776
My update is short.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.279
Right now, your daughter is
in her room on her phone.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.531
Her brother is
in his room on his phone,

00:31.573 --> 00:35.201
as they have been for 96%
of my week with them.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.870
- Anything fun
planned for the week?

00:36.911 --> 00:38.455
- Father and son fishing trip.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.498
- So no.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.751
- Well, I don't want to keep
you from fishing or leaving,

00:42.792 --> 00:44.753
so I'll see you next week.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.048
- Hey.
Guys, how's it going?

00:48.089 --> 00:49.591
- Hey.
- Hey, Trey.

00:49.632 --> 00:50.842
What do you say?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.052
[chuckles]

00:52.093 --> 00:53.386
Fancy looking luggage.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.763
What'd something
like that run you?

00:54.804 --> 00:56.514
- About $3,300.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.059
- Did it come
with $3,200 inside it?

00:59.100 --> 01:00.894
- Practicing
your dad jokes, Jim?

01:00.935 --> 01:02.937
- Yes, I am.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.273
- Keep practicing.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.237
- Trey's rolling luggage in.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.239
I didn't even realize
he was sleeping here now.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.367
Big development.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.411
Very peaceful
and easy-going of you, son.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.789
You're like Gandhi.

01:20.830 --> 01:24.125
- Yeah, if Gandhi's
ex-wife had her boyfriend

01:24.167 --> 01:25.877
stay over with her
and Gandhi's kids

01:25.919 --> 01:28.505
without asking Gandhi first.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.924
- So you didn't
know about this.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.760
You're simmering.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.471
This is what it was like
when Gandhi realized what

01:36.513 --> 01:39.224
the English were really up to.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.685
He got mad.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.937
How long do you think this
fight with Julia's gonna take?

01:43.978 --> 01:45.021
- There's not gonna be a fight.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.022
- Want me to order
something for you?

01:46.064 --> 01:47.023
- There's not gonna be a fight.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.858
- Turkey burger? No onions?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.819
Diet Coke?

01:50.860 --> 01:52.487
- Regular Coke.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.156
- * It's true *

01:55.198 --> 01:58.785
* The marriage that we once
had now is through *

01:58.827 --> 02:03.498
* And now we're doing
all that we can do *

02:03.540 --> 02:07.627
* To keep us all together
as a crew *

02:07.669 --> 02:11.631
* Trust, do as we say,
not as we do *

02:11.673 --> 02:15.218
* We really thought
that we were done *

02:15.260 --> 02:18.346
* But we've just begun *

02:21.057 --> 02:23.810
- Don't think I don't know
what you think I don't know.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.024
- I don't know what you
think you know that I know.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.985
- I'm talking about you
trying to sneak Trey in here

02:32.027 --> 02:33.528
to spend the night.
- Sneak?

02:33.570 --> 02:34.821
He just walked
through the front door

02:34.863 --> 02:38.783
with a gigantic
titanium suitcase.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.327
- Hiding in plain sight.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.163
- Dude, come on.
He's my fiancé now.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.330
We're more or less married.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.750
- Yeah, you're less married.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.335
You know when you'll
be more married?

02:48.376 --> 02:50.337
When you're married.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.671
And when you're married,
he can stay over.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.340
That's the rule we agreed to.
- Come on.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.799
Stop being such a prude.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.551
You slept over at my apartment
before we got married.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.969
- Yeah, because we
didn't have children.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.888
The only people we
were corrupting was us.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.390
Look, when we started
this whole nest thing,

03:02.432 --> 03:03.725
we were deliberate.

03:03.767 --> 03:04.851
We wrote at a constitution--
at your insistence,

03:04.893 --> 03:06.811
by the way--
article nine of which is,

03:06.853 --> 03:08.855
no romantic interest
may spend the night

03:08.897 --> 03:11.232
without a full family vote
and written consent.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.442
- Trey is not
a romantic interest.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.693
He's my fiancé.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.363
- For your sake,
I hope that came out wrong.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.781
And for the sake
of all the time

03:17.822 --> 03:19.991
we spent debating
and deliberating and mutually

03:20.033 --> 03:23.119
concluding, I must lower
my foot down as one

03:23.161 --> 03:24.913
does in such a circumstance.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.541
- What's the problem?

03:28.583 --> 03:29.793
- Why do you always
assume there's a problem?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.878
- Because there's
always a problem.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.380
- There's no problem.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.340
- I stand corrected.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.552
- The problem is
when two people

03:39.594 --> 03:41.930
have kids,
get divorced, you can't

03:41.971 --> 03:43.223
just do whatever you want.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.599
Because feelings get hurt.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.601
You have to foresee
potential pitfalls

03:46.643 --> 03:49.145
and agree on certain
guardrails and document it

03:49.187 --> 03:51.981
and ratify it and notarize

03:52.023 --> 03:53.983
what has been agreed upon.

03:56.945 --> 03:57.904
- What's he waving?

03:57.946 --> 03:59.656
- He's miming
waving a document.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.865
- Ah.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.409
- I don't have to mime it
because I have it.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.411
Follow me, please.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.496
- Do we have to follow him?

04:06.538 --> 04:08.873
- Yes, you have to follow me.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.253
Behold.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.922
The Kearney Family
Constitution,

04:15.964 --> 04:18.591
which codifies the fundamental
laws of the nest,

04:18.633 --> 04:20.593
itemized and laminated,
not unlike what

04:20.635 --> 04:23.763
Moses did with Yahweh's
Ten Commandments.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.765
- Why am I just finding
out about this now?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.142
- You don't know about Moses?

04:27.183 --> 04:29.185
Ah, where to begin.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.522
As a baby, he was placed in a
basket in the river Euphrates.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.606
- I think you mean the Nile.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.359
- If you knew,
why'd you ask me?

04:36.401 --> 04:37.694
- The agreement's
been in the drawer

04:37.736 --> 04:39.195
since the day we wrote it.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.613
And everything's
been working fine.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.366
- Because our laws have been
observed and not flouted.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.618
Julia, would you please
read article nine

04:45.660 --> 04:47.620
aloud to your lover?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.087
- "Neither parent shall have
a third party stay overnight

04:56.129 --> 04:57.088
in the nest while the--"

04:57.130 --> 04:58.840
- Whilst.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.427
Whilst.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.972
- "Whilst the children
are present

05:06.014 --> 05:08.850
without express written consent
from the other parent."

05:12.020 --> 05:14.647
- I am looking high and low
for my express written consent,

05:14.689 --> 05:16.983
and I am finding no
expression, no writing,

05:17.025 --> 05:19.444
and certainly no consent.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.404
- I don't get it.
What's the big deal?

05:21.446 --> 05:22.947
Julia and I sleep
at my place all the time.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.950
- Yeah, because your place
is hopefully a den

05:25.992 --> 05:27.827
of premarital sin.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.330
But the nest is a place where,
since our divorce,

05:30.372 --> 05:33.166
Julia and I have tried to give
our kids the false impression

05:33.208 --> 05:35.627
that nothing has changed.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.754
And whilst you mock
our constitution,

05:37.796 --> 05:40.256
it was Julia who
fought especially hard

05:40.298 --> 05:41.675
for the permission clause.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.176
- Because I wanted
to protect the kids

05:43.218 --> 05:46.096
from anyone who would,
if I'm being truthful,

05:46.137 --> 05:47.889
sleep with you.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.435
- Shows what you know.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.937
I haven't slept with anybody.
Ha!

05:55.730 --> 05:57.357
Bottom line,
it's up to the kids.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.900
Hey, kids, we need you.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.110
- OK. OK.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.611
You're right, you're right.
I know, Trey.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.363
It's a lot to absorb.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.115
- Phones down.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.994
That is technically down.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.830
- Kids, we are
thinking of having

06:11.871 --> 06:13.540
Trey stay over on my weeks.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.125
Would that be OK with you?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.418
- I'm cool with it.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.585
But how do you
feel about it, Dad?

06:17.627 --> 06:19.587
- I mean, I like Trey.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.756
I want him to feel
welcome in this family,

06:21.798 --> 06:23.591
but not at the expense
of your feelings.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.385
- Wait a second.
You're fine with this?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.595
What are we even doing here?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.597
- It is not about my feelings.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.932
It is about
a process that takes

06:30.974 --> 06:32.350
into account all
of our feelings

06:32.392 --> 06:34.102
for the sake of the children.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.522
Jimmy, how do you feel?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.899
- I thought he did
sleep over sometimes.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.697
- On the couch, only once.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.700
- I'll allow it. Jimmy?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.744
- I'm cool with Trey.
- Then it's unanimous.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.871
Where's my gavel?
- Oh, do we really--

06:52.912 --> 06:55.331
- Yes, we really
need the gavel!

06:55.373 --> 06:57.334
Article nine has been
amended to add Trey Taylor

06:57.375 --> 06:58.752
as a permanent guest.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.754
- Yes!
- Congratulations.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.505
- Constitutional
crisis averted.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.049
- Great.
Can I use the bathroom now?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.052
- Ah, permanent bathroom
rights are included.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.263
Out that window is the city
of Boston, the birthplace

07:10.305 --> 07:12.432
of America, democracy.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.767
Is it perfect?
No!

07:13.808 --> 07:15.310
Does it fall
into the wrong hands?

07:15.352 --> 07:16.603
All the time.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.104
But is that a reason
to throw it out?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.314
No, no, my friends.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.024
That is a reason
to fight for it.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.569
Democracy-- if there's a better
system, I haven't found it.

07:34.704 --> 07:34.913
.

07:34.954 --> 07:35.580
- Can you believe it?

07:36.915 --> 07:38.166
Our first official night
sleeping in the nest.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.635
- Kind of sunken in down here.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.762
- [laughs]

07:50.804 --> 07:52.931
The kids call it Daddy's Divot,

07:52.972 --> 07:54.891
created by Jim
sleeping in the exact

07:54.933 --> 07:56.476
same position every night.

07:56.518 --> 08:00.105
He'd take off all his clothes,
curl up, like knees to chest,

08:00.146 --> 08:02.816
boom, out like a light and
looking like a 150-pound fetus

08:02.857 --> 08:04.693
with a beard.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.529
- [chuckles nervously]
Oh, boy.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.947
Oh, no, I can't!
- What?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.115
What?
- I can't I can't.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.324
I'm sorry.
- What's wrong?

08:11.366 --> 08:12.367
- I can't.
I can't.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.702
I can't.
I-- I shouldn't.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.786
I shouldn't have to think
of Jim nude while resting

08:14.828 --> 08:15.995
in Jim's nude fetus divot.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.080
- Why didn't you say something?

08:17.122 --> 08:18.665
- It was seven seconds ago.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.417
I'm saying something.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.460
- How about we switch sides?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.170
- OK.
- OK.

08:36.683 --> 08:37.851
- It's a nightmare, right?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.728
- It's awful.
- Yeah.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.271
I have another idea.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.440
We can replace this mattress
with the same kind

08:43.481 --> 08:46.985
we have in my place,
the Royal Luxe Smart Mattress.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.486
Remember your first time on it?

08:48.528 --> 08:51.406
You said it was like sleeping
on a cloud made of clouds.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.700
It made no sense, but I
got what you were saying.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.493
- OK, you win.
Get me out of here.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.328
I'll call Jim first
thing in the morning.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.705
Wha--

08:58.747 --> 09:00.832
- Why?

09:00.874 --> 09:04.002
- [sighs]
Article 15.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.670
"Any new furniture
or appliances

09:05.712 --> 09:08.006
bigger than a toaster must
be approved by both parties."

09:08.048 --> 09:10.091
- The constitution covers beds.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.676
- This is what happens
when I watch the "Today Show."

09:11.718 --> 09:12.969
They put ideas in my head.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.430
Thanks a lot, Hoda.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.933
[upbeat music]

09:18.975 --> 09:20.727
- Hey. I am here.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.437
Heard there was
a constitutional issue.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.359
- More like
constitutional bonus.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.279
Trey wants to gift us
with an ultra-fancy high-end

09:31.321 --> 09:32.572
smart mattress.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.282
And because a mattress
is bigger than a toaster,

09:34.324 --> 09:36.576
I am respecting you
and following protocol.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.994
Congratulations.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.081
We're the winners
of a brand-new mattress.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.209
- So this is what our life
is gonna be like now.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.920
Trey wants to sleep over,
Trey sleeps over.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.339
Trey wants a new mattress,
we get a new mattress.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.551
All hail King Trey,
the mattress king.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.638
I say king, because clearly
the nest is a monarchy now.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.641
Democracy is just a facade.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.351
- I am asking you first.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.521
Now grab the gavel
and bang this into law.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.107
- Well, I do appreciate
that you asked me first.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.193
And I do love my gavel.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.112
Motion approved.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.781
Feel free to let Trey know
that the gavel has fallen

10:14.823 --> 10:17.575
and he may order
his new mattress anon.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.620
- [grunting]

10:20.662 --> 10:22.038
- To the right.
Going right.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.331
Watch it.
Watch it.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.375
Watch it.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.460
How you doing, Jimbo?

10:29.587 --> 10:32.090
- Treason!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.551
Ruling rescinded
due to egregiously

10:34.592 --> 10:37.345
premature expectation
of affirmative vote.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.222
- I didn't know that Trey had
already ordered the mattress.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.266
But now that it's here,
at least lie down on it.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.143
It is the best
mattress in the world.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.561
- It's not about the mattress.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.188
It is about how, in divorce,
we must conduct our lives

10:47.230 --> 10:50.191
with some level of grace so
that our selfishness does not

10:50.233 --> 10:52.277
cause us to make
decisions that divide us.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.946
- The Royal Luxe is about
Trey being a delicate sleeper.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.991
He's not trying to divide
us with a mattress.

11:10.170 --> 11:10.378
.

11:10.420 --> 11:10.879
[upbeat music]

11:12.630 --> 11:15.425
- Jimbo, I know I jumped
the gun, but hear me out.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.761
There's usually
a six-month waiting list.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.095
But I got lucky.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.014
Turns out Taylor Swift's
cats prefer hammocks.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.267
Try it out.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.354
- King Trey is now
ordering me to bed.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.105
- Try the mattress, Jimbo.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.523
You won't be sorry.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.233
- I don't care how
great the mattress is.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.401
It's never gonna
make any difference.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.195
I don't--

11:35.236 --> 11:39.449
oh, oh, my God.

11:39.491 --> 11:44.037
I can't tell where my body
stops and the bed begins.

11:44.079 --> 11:47.290
I wish I could take
my clothes off.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.001
- I'm so glad you have them on.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.505
- Jim?
- We can keep it.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.343
- Once again,
thank you for being so

11:58.385 --> 11:59.969
accommodating and agreeable.

12:00.011 --> 12:03.306
- Well, it is my nature.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.266
As James Madison said,
compromise

12:05.308 --> 12:07.143
is the key to democracy.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.478
- You know, that's funny.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.313
It's often attributed
to James Madison.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.357
But the quote's
actually Ben Franklin's.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.817
- And this quote is mine.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.610
[blows raspberry]

12:20.865 --> 12:21.908
- What's that?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.702
It looks like footprints.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.080
- Oh, I totally
forgot about those.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.791
Um, that was when
we first moved in.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.209
We didn't have any furniture.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.961
We just had
the mattress, remember.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.671
Bella, bella.
- Oh, yeah.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.214
[laughs]
Oh, bella.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.091
That was a night.
I forgot about those too.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.718
[laughs]

12:43.179 --> 12:45.056
- Can somebody explain
what's so funny?

12:45.098 --> 12:48.977
- Oh, well, years ago, we went
to the San Gennaro Festival

12:49.019 --> 12:50.270
and stomped grapes.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.521
My feet were still red
when we got home.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.064
And we kept calling
each other--

12:53.106 --> 12:55.025
- Bella, bella, what a fella.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.360
[laughter]

12:57.402 --> 13:01.239
- Yeah, but-- yeah,
but how'd the footprints

13:01.281 --> 13:03.867
get on the wall?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.577
- Uh--

13:05.618 --> 13:10.498
- Uh-- well, if we were to
do a forensic analysis--

13:10.540 --> 13:13.335
I mean, you know,
it was a long time ago,

13:13.376 --> 13:18.840
before my hip issues,
when my bursa was robust.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.260
I was the catcher on my
high school baseball team,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.596
so I could hold a stance
for at least nine innings.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.223
Again, my memory's not perfect.

13:27.265 --> 13:31.728
So I guess I was roughly
here with her legs

13:31.770 --> 13:36.816
wrapped around here
and the feet kind of--

13:36.858 --> 13:39.069
kind of braced here.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.196
And then--

13:42.739 --> 13:44.657
Bella, bella!

13:50.330 --> 13:51.623
- You're upset
about the footprints.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.832
- I'm not upset.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.501
- OK, OK, I can't lie.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.629
When Jim and I were married,
we hooked up.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.092
Grace and Jimmy were not
conceived immaculately.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.426
- No, I get that.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.761
It's just I don't
understand why

14:04.803 --> 14:06.262
I got to stare
at the sexy evidence

14:06.304 --> 14:08.306
on the wall behind the bed
where the hooking up happened.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.559
But I'm not upset.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.770
- You are, and you
have every right to be.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.146
But here's the thing.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.691
You can't see the footprints
through the headboard.

14:19.067 --> 14:23.113
- Once again, I'm not upset.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.406
But I'll still
know they're there.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.283
So good news, I got a solution.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.827
We're gonna paint--

14:28.868 --> 14:32.414
2, 3, 40 coats.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.290
- Great idea.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.292
And surely, the room needs it.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.794
But the constitution does say--

14:37.836 --> 14:39.295
- Stop with
the fricking constitution,

14:39.337 --> 14:42.132
I'm becoming an anarchist.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.634
- I just don't want
you to be upset.

14:44.676 --> 14:45.927
- I'm not upset.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.682
You know what's great about
having a place on Nantucket?

14:50.724 --> 14:53.018
You can send your
fiancée and her kids

14:53.059 --> 14:56.438
to Nantucket so you can
paint over her Italian sex

15:02.944 --> 15:03.153
.

15:03.194 --> 15:03.445
- I--

15:04.446 --> 15:06.823
smell--

15:06.865 --> 15:08.450
paint.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.326
You painted.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.453
- You're here.
Why?

15:11.494 --> 15:12.454
It's not your week.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.955
- Never mind why I'm here,

15:13.997 --> 15:15.457
which is to return my fishing
rod, which lives here,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.459
where I live sometimes.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.918
But let's talk
about how you painted.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.337
- I can explain.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.505
- [chuckles]
And you scolded me for lying

15:22.547 --> 15:24.215
about a dead goldfish,
but here you are

15:24.257 --> 15:25.508
ready to lie to me about this.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.843
- I didn't lie.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.094
I just didn't tell you.
Ask me if I painted.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.137
- Did you paint?
- Yep.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.805
- Oh!
Unbelievable!

15:30.847 --> 15:33.641
You are incapable of living
under anyone else's rules.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.393
Article 22, "No repainting--"

15:35.435 --> 15:37.020
- I know!
I know!

15:37.062 --> 15:38.271
- You knew?
- I knew.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.190
- [yelps]

15:40.231 --> 15:41.983
- It's the exact same color.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.235
It would have been dry
by the time it was your week.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.570
I was hoping you
wouldn't notice.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.654
It would have been like
I never painted at all.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.740
- Except you painted.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.200
- OK, fine.
You know what?

15:50.241 --> 15:51.451
I don't say this often.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.952
My bad.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.580
- You knowingly
spit in the face

15:55.622 --> 15:59.584
of the bedrock,
the foundation, the core values

15:59.626 --> 16:01.461
of this family.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.463
[chuckles]

16:06.466 --> 16:11.262
- What's going on?
- [laughing]

16:11.304 --> 16:13.098
- Why are you laughing?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.018
Why am I more scared
of the laughing

16:17.060 --> 16:18.103
than I am the yelling?

16:18.144 --> 16:19.688
- You should be scared.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.940
Because Julia's gonna kill you.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.150
- For painting?
I don't think so.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.402
- Not for painting.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.986
For erasing
our cherished memories.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.364
Your painters painted
over our height chart.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.907
- Height chart?

16:30.949 --> 16:33.576
- Yes, the height chart
that was here on this door

16:33.618 --> 16:35.829
where, for 14 years,
we measured

16:35.870 --> 16:38.206
our beloved children's height.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.458
- I didn't know there
was a height chart there.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.043
- And how could you?
Oh, wait.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.878
Maybe if you'd
followed protocol,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.380
you would have been made
aware of the height chart

16:45.422 --> 16:47.048
during one
of my many filibusters.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.385
But no, you went rogue,
your own little January 7th.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.720
- You mean January 6th.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.389
- No, January 7th,
the day they repainted.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.849
- Come on, man.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.308
This is a bit
of an overreaction.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.395
- So many memories--
oh, now painted over memories.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.606
Oh, little Jimmy Junior would
always say, one day, Dad,

17:03.648 --> 17:06.234
I'll be taller
and older than you.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.486
Adorable. Right?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.613
And, oh, how we laughed.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.032
But not anymore.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.616
No more laughter.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.368
All we have now is
the memory of our memories.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.621
That's what Julie will say--
or try to say, in between sobs.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.040
- Come on, man,
it was a mistake!

17:20.081 --> 17:23.376
- So was Jimmy Junior,
but we never painted over him.

17:23.418 --> 17:24.919
And it wasn't a mistake.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.880
You didn't just accidentally
call some painters.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.923
This is a way of saying,
hey, Jim Kearney.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.384
I'm Trey Taylor,
owner of the Boston Celtics.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.802
And I am in charge here.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.220
All you had to do was
play by the rules.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.014
- Not the rules, your rules.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.390
- Every article
has to be ratified.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.059
- Ratify this.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.602
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:40.643 --> 17:43.063
What are you guys doing,
for crying out loud?

17:43.104 --> 17:45.106
Throw a punch or shut up.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.275
- Trey painted over
the height chart.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.736
- You two are acting
like Gus and Charlie.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.321
- Who are Gus and Charlie?

17:51.363 --> 17:52.697
- They're our Basset hounds.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.282
We got Charlie
when he was a puppy.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.202
He peed on everything to
mark his territory, like Jim.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.163
And then we got
another Basset hound.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.915
- Gus?

18:01.956 --> 18:03.958
- Look how you worked that out.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.127
- Gus started peeing
on everything.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.546
Then Charlie peed
on everything Gus peed on.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.840
Gentlemen,
what you have here is

18:10.882 --> 18:12.801
a Basset hound peeing contest.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.971
Charlie, things are changing,
and you have to adapt.

18:17.013 --> 18:20.183
And, Gus, you may be
the king in your own kingdom,

18:20.225 --> 18:23.186
but you just entered
into another dog's yard.

18:23.228 --> 18:26.314
So drop it, both of you.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.649
- OK.

18:27.691 --> 18:30.860
I will admit,
I've been a little Charlie.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.155
- And I haven't been
respecting your rules,

18:34.197 --> 18:35.824
which I guess is
a little Gus-like, even

18:35.865 --> 18:37.659
though I've never met the dog.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.285
- I got to get out
of here before you

18:39.327 --> 18:42.622
guys start sniffing, licking,
and humping each other.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.125
- Gus and Charlie
became very close.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.501
- Well, what are we
gonna do about the height

18:46.543 --> 18:47.961
chart Gus painted over?

18:48.003 --> 18:49.879
- Oh, I can take care of that.

18:49.921 --> 18:53.383
A little turpentine and lye so
you can see the indentations.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.510
Julia will never know.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.846
Charlie, get me
some turpentine,

18:57.887 --> 19:00.181
a bucket, rags, and a mask.

19:00.223 --> 19:03.184
Gus, get me four cold beers
and a bag of chips.

19:03.226 --> 19:06.688
There's a 50/50 chance
this won't work.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.565
- I'll take those odds.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.819
- There wasn't a chance
it wasn't gonna work.

19:12.861 --> 19:16.406
I just wanted some
beer and chips.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.199
- Trey?
We're back.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.951
- Oh, they're back,
they're back, hurry up.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.161
Hurry up.
- All done.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.871
She'll never know
the difference.

19:22.912 --> 19:27.000
Operation Height
Chart completed.

19:27.042 --> 19:30.295
- Jim, Bobby, what are you--

19:30.337 --> 19:32.380
do I smell paint?

19:32.422 --> 19:33.882
Did you paint?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.800
- No, I talked to Trey,
and we agreed that we should

19:35.842 --> 19:37.385
paint the room together.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.720
- Let me understand.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.388
You and Trey talked.

19:40.430 --> 19:44.392
You had a bipartisan meeting
across the aisle?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.019
both: Yup.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.898
- The arc of
the moral universe bends

19:49.939 --> 19:52.734
towards you two getting along.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.402
- This is the new mattress?

19:54.444 --> 19:56.154
- Can we jump on it?

19:56.196 --> 19:57.572
- Let's check
your height first.

19:57.614 --> 19:58.573
- Oh, no, no, no.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.908
He's tall enough.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.201
No, no, just bounce
your little heart out.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.369
- Measure me, Mom.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.453
- OK.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.829
All right.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.581
Up 1/2 inch for Jimmy.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.918
Grace, now you.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.252
Ooh.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.088
An inch for Grace.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.339
Now me.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.423
Thank you.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.716
- Whoa.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.176
Growth spurt for Mom,
up 3 inches.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.136
- Mom.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.181
- Ah.
OK.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.474
- OK.

20:24.516 --> 20:25.600
All right.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.769
Uh-- same.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.562
- Well, you're
not shrinking yet.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.815
That's good.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.860
- Trey.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.371
I'm taller.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.706
- [laughs]

20:47.747 --> 20:50.750
[upbeat music]

20:50.792 --> 20:54.087
Look at you,
keeping magazines alive.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.006
- [chuckles]

20:56.047 --> 20:57.590
- Uh-oh.

20:57.632 --> 21:00.510
Just got a notification from
the Royal Luxe Smart Mattress.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.637
Jim just got naked.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.265
- How does the mattress know?

21:05.306 --> 21:07.225
- It's smart.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.687
[chuckles]

21:10.729 --> 21:12.147
- What are you doing?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.566
- Remote temperature
control.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.609
I'm gonna make it colder--

21:16.651 --> 21:19.362
much, much colder.

21:21.239 --> 21:24.159
- [shivering]

21:29.247 --> 21:32.292
