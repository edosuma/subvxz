00:15.165 --> 00:16.398

00:40.057 --> 00:43.358
But, uh,
people expect it sometimes.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.826
- Josh.

00:44.828 --> 00:46.294

up here the whole time.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.295

00:47.297 --> 00:48.763

00:48.765 --> 00:50.265

you know.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.200

gas to get us here, so--

00:52.202 --> 00:54.469
- Well, it won't be much use

00:54.471 --> 00:56.171

00:56.173 --> 00:57.906
- Oh, no, I'm positive.

00:57.908 --> 00:59.007
You know, I have proof.

00:59.009 --> 01:00.341

Now, hang on.
Hang on a minute.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.753
I am digging
your art installation.

01:11.755 --> 01:14.055

of the different phenomena--

01:14.057 --> 01:15.924

paranormal.

01:15.926 --> 01:16.925

01:16.927 --> 01:18.226

01:18.228 --> 01:20.328

the Moon rocks from falling?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.863
- Nah.
You gotta go with no.

01:21.865 --> 01:23.198
- Okay, then.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.200
Why don't we go with
what you've got inside, huh?

01:25.202 --> 01:26.367
- Oh, sure.
- Okay.

01:26.369 --> 01:28.369
- Yeah, but you're not
gonna like it.

01:41.218 --> 01:43.218
No, figuring out
when the debris would hit

01:43.220 --> 01:46.221
wasn't the hard part
with my background.

01:46.223 --> 01:47.922
- Which is what?

01:47.924 --> 01:49.457
- I was
an astrophysicist

01:49.459 --> 01:51.059
before things
took a turn.

01:51.061 --> 01:52.260
- What kind of turn?

01:52.262 --> 01:53.428
- Can't say.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.029
Just know there was a problem,
so I headed out

01:55.031 --> 01:56.831
into the Mojave
to try to figure it out.

01:56.833 --> 01:57.932
- Uh-huh.
- You know,

01:57.934 --> 01:59.367
next thing I knew,
it was 12 years later

01:59.369 --> 02:01.419
and the wife
had declared me dead.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.470
You know, I, uh,
I liked it a lot.

02:03.473 --> 02:04.906
So, you know, I stayed.

02:04.908 --> 02:06.941
Kept writing the physics
about what was coming,

02:06.943 --> 02:08.810
but no one would publish it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:08.812 --> 02:11.813
- So I wound up overnights
on the radio.

02:11.815 --> 02:13.448
Skinny heard me,
and he brought me out here

02:13.450 --> 02:15.283
when it all started
to blow.

02:15.285 --> 02:16.785
- Hey, what kind of physics
were you writing?

02:16.787 --> 02:18.820
- Oh, well, the only one
that matters.

02:18.822 --> 02:21.356
String theory, you know,
space and time.

02:21.358 --> 02:25.193
Plus I have the basic skills
for telescopic observations.

02:25.195 --> 02:26.361
- You have a scope here?

02:26.363 --> 02:27.362
- Yeah.
Out back.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.347
Nothing serious.

02:29.348 --> 02:31.331
Just enough to watch
the solar system go to shit.

02:31.334 --> 02:33.268
Anyway, uh,
video feed's in here.

02:36.473 --> 02:38.573
- You said that you could
predict when the debris hit.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.809
- Oh, ninth grade math,
man.

02:40.811 --> 02:42.443
Now, where it hits,
on the other hand,

02:42.445 --> 02:43.812
that's the fiesta.

02:43.814 --> 02:45.079
You know, given that
the world is spinning

02:45.081 --> 02:47.081
at, you know,
1,037 miles and all.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.583
- So it could miss us
completely.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.819
- Well, we got thousands of
these things coming at us.

02:50.821 --> 02:52.353
You know,
maybe tens of thousands.

02:52.355 --> 02:53.588
- All different sizes.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.824
- Yeah,
but same velocities.

02:55.826 --> 02:57.592
Which makes it worse.
Right?

02:57.594 --> 02:58.893
'Cause it's gonna hit

02:58.895 --> 03:01.229
all over the globe
all at the same time.

03:01.231 --> 03:02.931
- How close
to where we are?

03:02.933 --> 03:05.500
- Well, the local impact
is in a six-state radius

03:05.502 --> 03:07.235
around this building.

03:07.237 --> 03:08.436
- Six states is huge.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.572
- That could be
hundreds of miles away.

03:10.574 --> 03:12.273
- Yeah, no, no,
I wish it were.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.474
Let me show you something.

03:13.476 --> 03:17.612
This here is the feed
from my scope.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.214
Right there.

03:19.216 --> 03:21.349
Yeah, you see, that one's gonna
land right on top of us.

03:21.351 --> 03:22.350
It's about a mile across,

03:22.352 --> 03:23.952
moving ten miles a second.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.453
That makes a 12-mile crater,

03:25.455 --> 03:27.355
100-mile blast zone.

03:27.357 --> 03:28.923
And there's three more
like that,

03:28.925 --> 03:30.291
same path to here.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.494
Hundreds more
aimed at the Earth in general.

03:33.496 --> 03:36.497
So it doesn't matter
where in the six states.

03:36.499 --> 03:39.234
Anywhere is close enough
to kill us all.

03:39.236 --> 03:40.235
- Okay.

03:40.237 --> 03:42.103
- How long
to impact?

03:42.105 --> 03:43.371
- Oh, let's see.

03:43.373 --> 03:44.973
Ten miles a second,

03:44.975 --> 03:47.242
maybe two hours, you know,
and a bit.

03:47.244 --> 03:48.509
You know.

03:48.511 --> 03:51.379
Unless your dad and I
can figure out a way to stop it,

03:51.381 --> 03:53.615

two hours left to live.

08:14.377 --> 08:17.812
<i>The Moon's pouring down,</i>
<i>and we gotta blow town.</i>

08:17.814 --> 08:19.147
<i>So good luck</i>

08:19.149 --> 08:21.282
<i>and Godspeed, John Glenn.</i>

08:23.153 --> 08:24.152
- Mom?

08:24.154 --> 08:25.419
Mom!
- Karen!

08:25.421 --> 08:27.822
- Mom, wait!
- Karen! What the hell?

08:27.824 --> 08:28.923
There's only two hours left.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.358
- I know;
I gotta go find the kids.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.760
- But we need you here.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.161
- I understand.
Give me an hour.

08:33.163 --> 08:34.762
If I don't find them,
I'll come back. Fair?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.564
- [sighs]

08:36.566 --> 08:38.166
Fair.
Fair.

08:38.168 --> 08:41.435
- You have to stay here and
figure out how to survive this.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.171
Have I ever lied to you?

08:43.173 --> 08:44.472
- No, not even
when I wanted you to.

08:46.509 --> 08:47.542
- Okay.

08:47.544 --> 08:49.410
I'll see you soon.

08:49.412 --> 08:50.711
- Bring them back.

08:52.215 --> 08:53.748
- I will.

08:57.820 --> 08:59.187
- Be careful.

09:03.560 --> 09:03.791
Come on.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.565
- This is the last of it
from the motor home.

09:10.567 --> 09:12.500
- Great.

09:12.501 --> 09:14.434
- This is what I call
an art installation.

09:14.437 --> 09:15.503
- Well, laugh if you want,

09:15.505 --> 09:17.438
but this is the best shot
we got.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.308
- Actually, our best shot
would be a shuttle to Mars.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.843
- Listen.
You know what I'm thinking?

09:22.845 --> 09:25.680
Right in the middle
of all this.

09:25.682 --> 09:28.249
"The one is many,

09:28.251 --> 09:31.652
but the many are one."

09:31.654 --> 09:34.355
- Yeah.
All right.

09:34.357 --> 09:35.623
Why is that in the middle?

09:35.625 --> 09:36.824
- 'Cause everything leads to it.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.825
- But why?

09:37.827 --> 09:38.960
- I thought you knew why.

09:38.962 --> 09:40.628
- No, man.
I don't--I have no clue, man.

09:40.630 --> 09:41.796
That's why I need you.

09:41.797 --> 09:42.963
I just--this just
came into my head,

09:42.966 --> 09:44.832
flashed in my head,
and I couldn't get it out.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.434
- Same here.

09:46.436 --> 09:48.536
- I mean, I know it's key to
the whole thing and everything,

09:48.538 --> 09:49.704
and I knew
there was someone out there

09:49.706 --> 09:50.905
who was gonna help me
figure it out.

09:50.907 --> 09:52.740
- When you said that
I was an adept on the radio,

09:52.742 --> 09:54.475
I just understood
that I was one.

09:54.477 --> 09:56.677
- Yeah, which proves that
it is you.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.845
You're an adept.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.348
- Was it--why?
What is an adept?

10:00.350 --> 10:01.582
- Well, I think people like us,

10:01.584 --> 10:03.517
when we know something, man,
we just know it, right?

10:03.519 --> 10:06.020
Like the physics of it all
and everything like that.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.990
I mean, are you hip to the trip
of what is causing all this?

10:08.992 --> 10:10.324
- Well, I guessed
gravity waves.

10:10.326 --> 10:11.325
- There you go.

10:11.327 --> 10:12.693
Lady wins a little bear.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.694
- Yes!

10:13.696 --> 10:14.762
- This whole region of space

10:14.764 --> 10:16.530
is getting hit by gravity waves.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.499
Ripples in space and time.

10:18.501 --> 10:19.500
- How did you know?

10:19.502 --> 10:21.702
- Mm.
I have no clue.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.304
But usually when I say
something,

10:23.306 --> 10:24.438
it turns out to be right.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.773
- Like Mount Rainier.

10:25.775 --> 10:27.308
- There you go.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.376
- Right?

10:28.378 --> 10:30.311
See this whole
side of the board?

10:30.313 --> 10:33.447
This is the faith
and myth side.

10:33.449 --> 10:35.716
Like these skinwalkers,
Quetzalcoatls,

10:35.718 --> 10:37.852
End time prophecies
coming true.

10:37.854 --> 10:38.853
- Yeah, sure.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.855
But my thing is hard science.

10:40.857 --> 10:41.856
- That's the other side:
science.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.457
- Which is why I need you, man.

10:43.459 --> 10:44.492
You see,
you swing that shit, man.

10:44.494 --> 10:45.726
I can't.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.728
- Yeah, well,
here's what I'm thinking.

10:47.729 --> 10:49.729
The thing that's causing this,
whatever it is,

10:49.732 --> 10:50.898
we have to try to understand

10:50.900 --> 10:54.368
that it has both a physical side
and spiritual side.

10:54.370 --> 10:56.671
- But there has to be
some kind of unifying principle

10:56.673 --> 10:58.439
that connects this

10:58.441 --> 11:00.875
with, you know,
this and this,

11:00.877 --> 11:01.942
this--

11:01.944 --> 11:02.943
- Gloria Douglas.

11:02.945 --> 11:04.345
Right.
Gloria Douglas.

11:04.347 --> 11:05.846
There's a professor I knew,
Gloria Douglas.

11:05.848 --> 11:07.315
She was able to predict
a lot of this.

11:07.317 --> 11:10.084
You know, she said--
she said it just came to her.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.419
- Another adept.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.754
- Right, but she said it was
all about waves,

11:13.756 --> 11:14.822
"waves."

11:14.824 --> 11:16.324
She wasn't a physicist,

11:16.326 --> 11:18.326
so she didn't understand
what kind of wave or why, but--

11:18.328 --> 11:19.360
- She single?

11:19.362 --> 11:20.861
- No, dead.

11:20.863 --> 11:22.763
- [laughs]

11:22.765 --> 11:24.699
- Dad, what about
her computer cards?

11:27.503 --> 11:28.602
- Right.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.970
Yeah, we have them
in the motor home.

11:29.972 --> 11:31.072
Let's go.
- Yeah.

11:33.976 --> 11:35.443
- I got these from her.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.445
But we have nothing
to read them on.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.446
Here.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.383
- Are you
kidding me, man?

11:42.385 --> 11:43.417
These are brilliant.

11:43.419 --> 11:44.435
- But who knows
what kind of

11:44.436 --> 11:45.452
machine it would take
to read them?

11:45.455 --> 11:47.455
- A Docu-mation M-200.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.924
Last made in 1979.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.126
- Oh, well,
that's not good.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.561
- Oh, don't
harsh the buzz.

11:53.563 --> 11:54.562
I happen to own one.

11:54.564 --> 11:55.563
- That's impossible.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.131
- Bought it off a guy
in 1981.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.132
I don't know why,

11:58.134 --> 11:59.467
but I kept it
ever since.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.469
You know, all
222 pounds of it.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.004
- Okay, well, let's--
Let's go run the cards.

12:04.006 --> 12:05.139
- Moondog.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.974
- Yeah, a little
problem there.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.143
My compadre's
holding it for me.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.145
He's got half my shit.
- Is he nearby?

12:11.147 --> 12:12.880
- He's a few miles
down the track.

12:12.882 --> 12:14.682
You know,
I can get on the blower.

12:14.684 --> 12:16.717
- What, the phone?
- Phones don't work.

12:16.719 --> 12:18.986
CB radios,
some of the community have.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.989
Battery operated,
so they still go.

12:21.991 --> 12:22.990
Hey, you know what?

12:22.992 --> 12:24.725
Also last made in '79,

12:24.727 --> 12:26.861
same as your card reader.

12:26.863 --> 12:27.995
- All right, let's go.
Let's do it.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.096
- Let's mash up
the motor

12:29.098 --> 12:31.031
and see if we can scare up
the mud duck.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.402
- What does that mean?
- I don't actually know.

12:34.404 --> 12:35.603
But I suspect it's relevant

12:35.605 --> 12:37.605
'cause...two hours.
- Okay. Okay.

12:37.607 --> 12:38.873
[engine roaring]

12:38.875 --> 12:40.141
<i>- No, I'm not doing that.</i>

12:40.143 --> 12:42.143
<i>- Just do it, for god's sake.</i>

12:42.145 --> 12:44.445
<i>- Why?</i>
<i>Why would I pull over?</i>

12:44.447 --> 12:45.613
<i>- Because I need to pee.</i>

12:45.615 --> 12:47.014
<i>- What do you mean</i>
<i>you have to pee?</i>

12:47.016 --> 12:48.949
<i>- That's not something</i>
<i>with unclear meaning.</i>

12:48.951 --> 12:51.152
It'll take 20 seconds.

12:51.154 --> 12:52.720
- Okay, well,
I've shared a bathroom with you

12:52.722 --> 12:54.722
and I've seen you take
20 minutes.

12:54.724 --> 12:55.990
Plus we could die any second.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.591
- We're not gonna die
this second.

12:57.593 --> 12:58.592
Okay, just pull over.

12:58.594 --> 12:59.593
- My god.

12:59.595 --> 13:01.829
Goddamn it, Matt!

13:01.831 --> 13:04.131
- Right there.
- Okay! Okay.

13:04.133 --> 13:05.433
<i>- Just pull over.</i>

13:05.435 --> 13:06.500
<i>- Okay.</i>

13:06.502 --> 13:08.291
<i>- Okay, great.</i>
<i>Go, go, go, go, go.</i>

13:08.292 --> 13:10.081
<i>And stop.</i>

13:10.082 --> 13:11.871
<i>- Hurry up.</i>

13:11.874 --> 13:14.074
I'm not waiting for you!

13:14.076 --> 13:15.910
I'll leave you behind!

13:19.882 --> 13:21.148
- Look away!

13:21.150 --> 13:22.883
- I'm not watching you!

13:22.885 --> 13:23.918
God!

13:26.155 --> 13:28.756
- This is gonna go a lot faster
if I know you're not looking.

13:28.758 --> 13:29.790
- Okay!

13:30.927 --> 13:32.193
- [sighs]

13:35.231 --> 13:37.031
- Hey!

13:37.033 --> 13:39.233
Yeah, so I, uh, I got good news;
I got bad news.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.734
- I'll take the good news.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.770
- Well, my buddy's got it.
Guy called The Junkman.

13:42.771 --> 13:44.805
- I'm guessing
he's also the bad news.

13:44.807 --> 13:47.007
- Well, here's the thing.
The Junkman and I, we're solid.

13:47.009 --> 13:49.009
He leads the league
in old-time electronics.

13:49.011 --> 13:50.244
Helped me build my studio.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.679
Got me this really sweet
vintage ribbon mic--

13:51.681 --> 13:52.780
- Bob!
Bob, what's the bad news?

13:52.782 --> 13:54.248
- Oh, the bad news is.
Yeah, uh...

13:54.250 --> 13:55.549
Yeah, he says
he's gonna kill you.

14:00.690 --> 14:03.023
- So why does The Junkman
want to kill my father?

14:03.025 --> 14:04.658
- Maybe 'cause
Skinny Jardin is dead.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.126
- What?
- Oh, that guy you met here.

14:06.128 --> 14:07.495
He was killed
by that federale.

14:07.497 --> 14:08.696
- I know who Skinny Jardin is,
but why--

14:08.698 --> 14:10.865
- The Junkman says
that Skinny would still be alive

14:10.867 --> 14:11.866
if he hadn't met you.

14:11.868 --> 14:13.301
So he's holding you responsible.

14:13.302 --> 14:14.735
- That's ridiculous.
- Well, you gotta--

14:14.737 --> 14:16.203
You gotta admit,
you're in the chain.

14:16.205 --> 14:17.738
- Well, will he let you
do the cards?

14:17.740 --> 14:18.739
- No.
No, no, no, no.

14:18.741 --> 14:19.773
He said he'd kill me too

14:19.775 --> 14:21.509
because I'd be working for you.

14:21.511 --> 14:22.710
You coming?

14:22.712 --> 14:24.712
- To meet the man
who wants to kill my father?

14:24.714 --> 14:25.713
- Yeah.

14:25.715 --> 14:27.181
Hour 50 left.

14:27.183 --> 14:28.716
- Nothing better to do.

14:28.718 --> 14:30.017
- [grunts]

14:31.821 --> 14:34.188
All right, Junkman.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.689
Here we come.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.696
- Are you done?

14:44.233 --> 14:45.699
Matt!

14:48.971 --> 14:50.170
Matt!

14:50.172 --> 14:52.172
Oh, goddamn it.

14:52.174 --> 14:53.841
Matt?

14:53.843 --> 14:55.175
Matt!

14:56.979 --> 14:58.178
Matt!

14:59.749 --> 15:01.048
Oh, what now?

15:01.050 --> 15:02.149
Skinwalkers?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.183
Wormholes?

15:03.185 --> 15:04.952
Any of the other
bullshit ways to die?

15:06.088 --> 15:07.087
Matt!

15:08.824 --> 15:11.258
Matt!

15:11.260 --> 15:13.627
Shit.

15:13.629 --> 15:14.962
Matt!

15:16.766 --> 15:18.666
If I find you
and you're not dead,

15:18.668 --> 15:20.301
I'm gonna be pissed off!

15:23.706 --> 15:25.039
- You're saying
that gravity waves

15:25.041 --> 15:26.774
are responsible
for all this physical stuff?

15:26.776 --> 15:28.676
- Well, they ring the Earth
like a bell, baby.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.812
That accounts for earthquakes,
tidal waves, volcanoes--

15:31.814 --> 15:34.148
- Is there any chance
that the waves affect time too?

15:34.150 --> 15:35.182
- Oh, sure.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.617
They push and pull it
all around.

15:36.619 --> 15:37.818
- So I'm not a physicist,

15:37.820 --> 15:40.754
but I believe that
many in your community

15:40.756 --> 15:42.690
are beginning to accept
the possibility at least

15:42.692 --> 15:44.325
of a multi-dimensional
universe.

15:44.327 --> 15:45.926
- Oh, that's
a olden goldie.

15:45.928 --> 15:48.128
String theory
says 11 dimensions.

15:48.130 --> 15:49.446
- Wow.

15:49.447 --> 15:50.763
- So the gravity waves
could also

15:50.766 --> 15:51.932
be breaking down the barriers

15:51.934 --> 15:53.033
between the 11 dimensions?

15:53.035 --> 15:54.368
- That's exactly
what they do.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.303

You're cracking up.

27:28.597 --> 27:30.563
Let's go talk about it.

27:30.565 --> 27:31.564
- Not you.
Stay in the car.

27:31.566 --> 27:32.599
- Forget it.

27:32.601 --> 27:33.900
- It's not a choice.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.702
Stay in the car
if you want to live.

27:35.704 --> 27:36.836
- Not without him.

27:43.712 --> 27:45.979
- Look, Bree,

27:45.981 --> 27:48.715
you're right.

27:48.717 --> 27:51.451
This is very hard for you.

27:51.453 --> 27:54.321
I get that.

27:54.323 --> 27:55.455
You've had your older brother

27:55.457 --> 27:58.458
looking out for you
all your life.

27:58.460 --> 28:02.495
You never had to share me
with anyone except maybe Dana.

28:02.497 --> 28:05.732
But you always ran over her.

28:05.734 --> 28:07.500
Now you have to share me
with somebody else?

28:09.438 --> 28:12.505
That can't be easy,

28:12.507 --> 28:13.773
especially for you.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.809
You always had to be
the center of attention.

28:15.811 --> 28:16.843
- No, I don't.

28:16.845 --> 28:18.878
- This is the woman

28:18.880 --> 28:20.580
I fell in love with.

28:20.582 --> 28:23.883
She's part of the family now.

28:23.885 --> 28:28.621
I'll still always
be there for you,

28:28.623 --> 28:31.991
but I'm with her too.

28:31.993 --> 28:33.993
She's amazing, by the way.

28:33.995 --> 28:36.730
But you just don't
know her yet.

28:36.732 --> 28:38.465
She's gonna change our family.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.599
She's gonna make it better.

28:39.601 --> 28:40.600
I promise.

28:44.005 --> 28:45.772
Give me the gun.

28:45.774 --> 28:46.940
[gun cocks]

28:46.942 --> 28:48.775
- You're not Matt.
You're a shifter.

28:48.777 --> 28:50.443
But you're smarter.
- What's a shifter?

28:50.445 --> 28:52.746
- This is not a good time
for Brianna drama.

28:52.748 --> 28:54.547
- What are you doing?
- Back off, Sarah!

28:54.549 --> 28:55.982
- It's cool, sweetie.
- It's not cool.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.984
He's dangerous.
He'll kill you.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.586
- Well, that is the worst shit
that I've ever heard.

28:59.588 --> 29:00.820
Put down the gun.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.589
- He's not my brother!
I know my brother!

29:02.991 --> 29:07.594
- Bree!

29:07.596 --> 29:08.928
Matt!

29:08.930 --> 29:10.530
Matt, what are you doing?

29:10.532 --> 29:11.731
[gasping, panting]

29:11.733 --> 29:12.966
- [screams]

29:12.968 --> 29:16.002
[both grunting]

29:18.707 --> 29:19.873
- [screams]

29:19.875 --> 29:22.709
- [growls]
- [screams]

29:22.711 --> 29:23.910
[gunshot]

29:27.082 --> 29:29.015
- Oh, my god.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.551
Matt?

29:31.553 --> 29:34.454
- How could you think
this was me?

29:34.456 --> 29:35.455
- What do you mean?

29:35.457 --> 29:36.890
It was your girlfriend!

29:36.892 --> 29:38.158
Ugh!

29:41.763 --> 29:43.196
- We can't find our way home,

29:43.198 --> 29:44.731
so we're evolving.

29:44.733 --> 29:46.900
Soon you won't be able
to kill us.

29:46.902 --> 29:48.835
- Good thing the end of
the world's today, then, huh?

29:48.837 --> 29:50.503
[gunshot]

29:58.180 --> 30:00.013
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.615
- Look, Dad.

30:02.617 --> 30:04.150
any day that you can shoot

30:04.152 --> 30:06.986
a huge malevolent man
in the ass

30:06.988 --> 30:08.888
and not answer for it,

30:08.890 --> 30:11.191
that day cannot be called
a total waste.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.033
- You took off.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.134
Where did you go?

30:21.136 --> 30:22.502
- I found Sarah.

30:22.504 --> 30:24.170
- You didn't find me.
I was miles away.

30:24.172 --> 30:25.939
- Yeah, but...

30:25.941 --> 30:27.607
it looked exactly like you.

30:27.609 --> 30:28.908
- What the hell was that?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.710
- A shape-shifter.

30:30.712 --> 30:32.178
- They've evolved.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.513
- They're like a...

30:33.515 --> 30:34.647
virus...

30:34.649 --> 30:35.648
that copies your DNA.

30:35.650 --> 30:36.983
And it

30:36.985 --> 30:39.152
starts killing people.

30:39.154 --> 30:41.588
- And you found one
that looked like me?

30:41.590 --> 30:44.023
What did you do with it?

30:44.025 --> 30:45.058
- No choice.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.527
I killed it.

30:47.529 --> 30:50.263
- I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.898
- Trust me when I say
you're relieved.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.900
Can you please explain to me
what happened, Matt?

30:55.737 --> 30:57.070
- I found Sarah.

30:59.007 --> 31:00.940
I wanted to grab
a couple minutes with her.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.276
- Okay,
so to clarify,

31:03.278 --> 31:04.777
The world's
ending today,

31:04.779 --> 31:06.746
and you decided
to stop for sex.

31:06.748 --> 31:08.748
- I didn't do anything.

31:08.750 --> 31:10.283
I knew what she was,

31:10.285 --> 31:11.885
and by that point,
you were already gone.

31:11.887 --> 31:14.287
- Okay, and where did
the truck come from?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.755
- I hotwired it.

31:15.757 --> 31:18.191
- Of course you did.
- I learned from you.

31:18.193 --> 31:21.060
Can we please
just get back to Mom and Dad?

31:22.597 --> 31:23.663
Huh?

31:23.665 --> 31:25.164
- All right,
but we're taking my car.

31:25.166 --> 31:26.266
It's cooler.

31:26.268 --> 31:28.167
- So you made out
with another woman.

31:28.169 --> 31:31.070
- It's an exact
genetic copy of you.

31:31.072 --> 31:32.305
- How'd you know it wasn't me?

31:34.142 --> 31:36.643
- The kissing was weird.

31:37.612 --> 31:38.912
What about your shifter?

31:38.914 --> 31:40.780
- The kissing was great.

31:40.782 --> 31:42.181
- No, it wasn't.

31:42.183 --> 31:44.851
- Way better than usual.

31:44.853 --> 31:46.219
- Oh, shut up.
- [laughs]

31:46.221 --> 31:49.289
[engine turns over]

31:49.291 --> 31:50.757
- I like her.

31:50.759 --> 31:51.891
- Great.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.034
- Karen!

32:01.036 --> 32:02.302
Karen!

32:02.304 --> 32:04.771
Matt!

32:04.773 --> 32:07.907
- "The end of the world
is not.

32:07.909 --> 32:09.642
The end of the world is not"
what?

32:09.644 --> 32:12.178
- We know what it says,
Peaches.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.646
- Wait.

32:13.648 --> 32:15.048
Wait.

32:15.050 --> 32:16.816
Read it again.

32:16.818 --> 32:19.185
- It says
"The end of the world is not.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.054
The end of the world is not."

32:22.357 --> 32:23.656
- That's it.

32:23.658 --> 32:25.291
It's fragmented.

32:25.293 --> 32:27.260
"The end of the world
is not the end of the world."

32:27.262 --> 32:28.628
The end of the world's not
the end of the world.

32:28.630 --> 32:29.896
- No, when those chunks hit,

32:29.898 --> 32:31.230
it'll be the end of the world.

32:31.232 --> 32:32.231
- No, it's not.
It never is.

32:32.233 --> 32:33.633
In every end-time story,

32:33.635 --> 32:35.301
the end of the world
is not the end of the world.

32:35.303 --> 32:37.036
In Buddhism,
cosmic law is restored.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.871
People live for 80,000 years.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.673
In Christianity,
during the Christian apocalypse,

32:40.675 --> 32:42.458
heaven comes down to Earth,

32:42.459 --> 32:44.242
and a new Jerusalem is born.

32:44.245 --> 32:45.979
It's never the end.

32:45.981 --> 32:47.146
I'm telling you,

32:47.148 --> 32:48.681
there always appears
after the present

32:48.683 --> 32:50.350
something that's
even better.

32:52.621 --> 32:53.920
- I'm not the religious type.

32:53.922 --> 32:55.688
Mostly metaphysics.
But, uh...

32:55.690 --> 32:57.924
- It's based on the punch cards
Gloria Douglas gave us.

32:57.926 --> 32:59.258
It's science.

32:59.260 --> 33:01.661
So it's telling us
it's survivable.

33:01.663 --> 33:03.229
We just have to figure out how.

33:06.334 --> 33:07.800
- Adept.

33:09.938 --> 33:11.971
- So the sentence fragment
is always in three pieces.

33:11.973 --> 33:13.906
- Three, three, three wave--

33:13.908 --> 33:14.941
- Three dimensions?

33:14.943 --> 33:16.342
- Three ages.
- A trinity.

33:16.344 --> 33:18.077
- Waves.
- You mean gravity waves.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.379
- So this thing comes in waves.

33:19.381 --> 33:21.081
- So this is telling us
that there's three of them.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.782
- Right, and the Final Event

33:22.784 --> 33:24.083
is the end of the first wave?

33:24.085 --> 33:25.385
- This can be survived.

33:25.387 --> 33:26.386
This can be survived.

33:26.388 --> 33:27.654
- Yeah.
- How?

33:27.656 --> 33:29.088
- Well, it doesn't
tell us how.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.691
- Yeah.

33:31.693 --> 33:34.093
Well, we got less than an hour,
Loyalistas.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.095
Way less.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.335
- [sighs]

33:42.337 --> 33:43.803
Where are my kids?
Come on.

33:43.805 --> 33:45.204
Come on.

33:45.206 --> 33:46.205
Where are my kids?

33:46.207 --> 33:48.908
[sighing]

33:48.910 --> 33:50.093
<i>I'm out here looking.</i>

33:50.094 --> 33:51.277
<i>Where are your kids?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

33:51.279 --> 33:53.046
<i>Where are my kids?</i>

33:53.048 --> 33:54.047
<i>Hey.</i>

33:54.049 --> 33:55.081
<i>Kids.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

33:55.083 --> 33:56.739
<i>I am the price</i>
<i>for what I want.</i>

33:56.740 --> 33:58.396
<i>I am the price</i>
<i>for what I want.</i>

33:58.397 --> 34:00.053
<i>That's all right.</i>

34:00.055 --> 34:01.187
<i>Where are my kids?</i>
<i>Where are my kids?</i>

34:01.189 --> 34:03.022
<i>I am the price</i>
<i>for what I want.</i>

34:03.024 --> 34:04.290
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>[sobbing]</i>

34:04.292 --> 34:07.260
<i>[loud droning]</i>

34:07.262 --> 34:08.327
<i>[grunting]</i>

34:08.329 --> 34:09.395
<i>The price for...</i>

34:09.397 --> 34:11.931
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

34:11.933 --> 34:15.134
[panting]

34:15.136 --> 34:17.403
I gotta leave.

34:17.405 --> 34:18.471
[sighs]

34:26.247 --> 34:27.480
Okay.

34:29.084 --> 34:30.316
I'll sit down.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.484
I'll stay still.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.786
[panting]

34:33.788 --> 34:36.055
I'll stay still,
and they'll find me.

34:36.057 --> 34:38.324
Okay.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.360
[sobbing]

34:47.235 --> 34:48.935
- All right, so the key is
to get at that boundary

34:48.937 --> 34:52.305
between that physical
and the spiritual thing.

34:52.307 --> 34:53.473
- So it's like
the yin and the yang:

34:53.475 --> 34:54.741
two sides that
are coming together,

34:54.743 --> 34:57.076
equal but opposite and then

34:57.078 --> 34:59.212
like dimensions colliding.

34:59.214 --> 35:00.880
- That's where the mythical
creatures are coming from.

35:00.882 --> 35:02.014
- Yeah, and we know there's
contact points

35:02.016 --> 35:03.182
between dimensions everywhere.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.417
- The wormholes.

35:04.419 --> 35:06.352
- You mean the tiny black hole
kind of "wormhole"?

35:06.354 --> 35:09.088
- Yes, like the kind that sucked
up all the people in Seattle

35:09.090 --> 35:10.223
and dozens of other cities.

35:10.225 --> 35:11.424
- Millions of people...

35:11.426 --> 35:13.126
- Being pulled
into other dimensions.

35:13.128 --> 35:14.861
Yeah, man, I get that.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.429
Sure, there could be
storms of those things

35:16.431 --> 35:17.797
streaking through space like--

35:17.799 --> 35:18.998
- Cosmic bullets.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.333
That's what that is.

35:20.335 --> 35:21.400
- Exactly, man.

35:21.402 --> 35:24.937
That's exactly--
You are an adept!

35:24.939 --> 35:26.339
- How's that gonna help us
stop the Moon rocks?

35:26.341 --> 35:27.340
I mean, in what?

35:27.342 --> 35:29.475
- 44 minutes left.
- 44 minutes.

35:29.477 --> 35:31.944
- 42 on a lucky first strike.

35:31.946 --> 35:35.815
Hey, hey.
42, Jackie Robinson, baby.

35:35.817 --> 35:36.883
Love that brother.

35:45.860 --> 35:46.993
<i>- Matt!</i>

35:46.995 --> 35:49.829
<i>Mom's here!</i>

35:49.831 --> 35:51.230
<i>Mom!</i>
<i>- Mom!</i>

35:51.232 --> 35:53.232
<i>- Mom!</i>
<i>- Mom!</i>

35:53.234 --> 35:55.334
<i>- Mom, where did you go?</i>

35:55.336 --> 35:56.936
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

35:56.938 --> 35:58.805
- What happened to you?

35:58.807 --> 36:00.173
- Get her.
Get her up. Get her up.

36:00.175 --> 36:01.274
- [grunts]
- Get her up.

36:01.276 --> 36:02.809
- Oh!
- Oh, I got you.

36:02.811 --> 36:04.877
- Look at you.

36:04.879 --> 36:05.912
Oh.
- Go get the door.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.948
- [sobbing]

36:11.486 --> 36:13.152
- The wormholes,
they can suck up people.

36:13.154 --> 36:14.287
Can they suck up anything?

36:14.289 --> 36:17.023
- Anything with space and time,
my brother.

36:17.025 --> 36:19.225
- Like big pieces of the Moon?

36:19.227 --> 36:21.160
- All right, how do we
get the wormholes here?

36:22.864 --> 36:24.831
- That skinwalker
that was in you.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.065
- Wait.
What?

36:26.067 --> 36:27.967
- The Tesla Tower drew it out,
didn't it?

36:27.969 --> 36:30.503
- Yeah, like it was magnetically
attracted or something.

36:30.505 --> 36:32.371
- Well, you know, Tesla
figured out how to get power

36:32.373 --> 36:33.973
from the atmosphere.

36:33.975 --> 36:35.942
That tower attracts
electromagnetic energy

36:35.944 --> 36:38.010
of all kinds.

36:38.012 --> 36:40.213
- And the wormholes
pump energy like crazy.

36:40.215 --> 36:43.482
- We have to turn it on.
We have to leave it on.

36:43.484 --> 36:44.617
- And they'll get pulled here.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.953
- Assuming we can find
a wormhole;

36:46.955 --> 36:49.155
if we got one in range.

36:49.157 --> 36:52.959
All right, so we drag a wormhole
over the tower.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.294
It sucks the Moon shit into
another dimension.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.495
- And nobody dies.

36:56.497 --> 36:58.231
- If the wormhole gets here
before the rocks.

36:58.233 --> 37:00.967
- Right, which are on their way
at ten miles a second.

37:09.043 --> 37:11.510
- Moondog, how's it coming
with the line boosters?

37:11.512 --> 37:14.113

<i>but you got company.</i>

37:14.115 --> 37:16.148

<i>from out of the woods.</i>

37:18.620 --> 37:19.952
- It's Mom.

37:19.954 --> 37:21.087
She found them.

37:23.091 --> 37:25.091
- You made it.
- Yeah.

37:25.093 --> 37:27.226
Told you I would.

37:27.228 --> 37:28.361
- We're using
the Tesla tower

37:28.363 --> 37:30.296
to attract the wormholes.
- What?

37:30.298 --> 37:32.231
- It's gonna take a whole hell
of a lot of power.

37:32.233 --> 37:34.667
But Moondog's gonna have to
crank it to max.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.970
- I wired up two line boosters
in parallel.

37:37.972 --> 37:39.372
- You think it'll work?
- Oh, yeah.

37:39.374 --> 37:40.907
Or the whole building
will blow up.

37:40.909 --> 37:42.108
So, you know, 50/50.

38:02.630 --> 38:05.965
Let's hope the circuits
can take the surge.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.099

38:07.101 --> 38:09.168
- Come on.
Show me something.

38:09.170 --> 38:11.938

the wormholes or it's over.
