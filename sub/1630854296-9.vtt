WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:07.541
Previously on Fire Country...

00:07.641 --> 00:09.910
You and me
while you're with Jake,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.112
it's over the line.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.013
You don't want me
to call at all?

00:13.114 --> 00:15.649
Rebecca, I'm flattered.
But I'm not the cap's daughter?

00:15.749 --> 00:17.585
That's different.
Yeah, she's out there,

00:17.685 --> 00:19.653
we're in here. Let's escape.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.789
You know what I liked
most about you diving?

00:21.889 --> 00:23.557
Let's not do this
again, Dad, please.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.726
That look on your face
every time you dove.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.795
I saw that same look today.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.530
MANNY:
The car's teetering
over the edge. It goes over,

00:29.630 --> 00:30.864
it takes both
those kids with it.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.433
Let's get them out of there.
(screams)

00:32.533 --> 00:34.235
Good job.
Get me out of here!

00:34.335 --> 00:36.070
MANNY:
This car is falling apart.
We need a plan B.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.806
Bode, no don't!
Bode!

00:38.906 --> 00:40.974
Get him out now,
or this was all for nothing.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.443
Get Bode, get Bode.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.545
Take my hand.
Grab my hand, Bode!

00:44.645 --> 00:46.547
(grunts, yells)
Come on!

00:47.515 --> 00:49.917
No, no, no, no, Bode!

00:51.819 --> 00:52.886
Bode!

00:58.526 --> 01:00.394
ERIKA:
An incarcerated firefighter

01:00.494 --> 01:03.131
inserts himself
into a precarious rescue

01:03.231 --> 01:05.366
without being ordered to do so.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.202
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg

01:08.302 --> 01:10.604
of a call that
went so sideways

01:10.704 --> 01:12.606
even the rescue is
under review here today.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.708
Sorry, is that a question?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.043
(scoffs)

01:16.144 --> 01:17.978
Chief.
(clears throat)

01:18.078 --> 01:19.413
I'm with Cal Fire, too.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.950
I'm here to help you.
But I do have to ask you

01:23.050 --> 01:25.386
and your team about what
the hell happened out there.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.361
State your name and rank
for the record.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.063
Battalion Chief Vince Leone.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.999
You were the incident commander
on the day in question, yes?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.067
Yes.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.202
When would you say

01:41.302 --> 01:42.770
you lost control
of the call?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.104
I wouldn't.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.007
Either you did
or you sanctioned this mess,

01:47.107 --> 01:49.143
which is much worse.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.811
So, I'll ask again,

01:50.911 --> 01:53.781
when did you lose control
of the call?

02:02.523 --> 02:05.793
Probably when a, uh, firefighter

02:05.893 --> 02:08.662
went off a bridge
into the water.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.175
This is not happening.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.943
Maybe he survived the fall.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.179
FIREFIGHTER:
Oh, my God.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.714
Bode? No!

02:26.814 --> 02:27.915
Check the other side
of the bridge.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.116
Bode!

02:29.217 --> 02:31.385
I don't see the car!

02:31.485 --> 02:34.488
Which of the two firefighters
who went off the bridge

02:34.588 --> 02:36.123
are you referring to?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.693
Call Swift Water Rescue.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.195
Greencrest, Engine 1591,

02:41.295 --> 02:43.864
emergency traffic.
We have an inmate firefighter

02:43.964 --> 02:45.599
who's fallen over
the Ledgewood Bridge

02:45.699 --> 02:47.301
into rapid
river waters below.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.203
We have no sight
on his location.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.855
Gabriela, what are you doing?

03:12.660 --> 03:13.927
No, no, no, no...

03:14.027 --> 03:15.229
Probie! No!

03:17.965 --> 03:20.468
(shouting)

03:28.976 --> 03:31.178
No! Vince, that's my daughter.
FIREFIGHTER: Anybody see her?

03:31.279 --> 03:33.914
That's my daughter, Vince.
FIREFIGHTER 2:
Negative, I can't see her!

03:34.014 --> 03:36.417
No! (shouts)

03:36.517 --> 03:39.420
State your name and rank
for the record.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.590
Captain Manuel Remy Perez.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.826
How would you describe your
relationship with Bode Donovan?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.061
He's an inmate on my hand crew.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.097
That's all he is to you?

03:51.565 --> 03:55.436
An inmate firefighter
that I work with. That's it.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.137
And Gabriela Perez?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.238
She's my girlfriend.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.172
My only daughter.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.941
She's my best probie.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.745
Chief.
If she's your best probie,

04:04.845 --> 04:07.715
help me understand
how she went off a bridge

04:07.815 --> 04:11.084
before going MIA
with your own son,

04:11.184 --> 04:12.620
unsanctioned?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.422
It was a unique situation.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.524
But I'm afraid legal is gonna
want more specifics.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.158
Legal?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.660
A life was lost.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.363
You can't be surprised
when people want answers.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.898
Chaos often starts at the top.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.935
Firefighters match their
commander's tone. That's you.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.039
But you weren't the only
authority figure that day.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.243
If you're waiting for me
to throw a fellow firefighter

04:36.344 --> 04:39.279
under the bus,
we're gonna be here a long time.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.148
How would you describe

04:41.248 --> 04:43.351
your state of mind
that day, Captain?

04:43.451 --> 04:46.720
My daughter jumped off
a bridge. Take a guess.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.596
It's the worst feeling
in the world,

04:55.696 --> 04:56.764
knowing that
your child needs you

04:56.864 --> 04:58.131
and not being able to help.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.233
Not being able or
not being allowed to?

05:00.334 --> 05:01.969
Is there a difference?

05:05.005 --> 05:08.642
What were your stress levels
before Gabriela jumped?

05:11.044 --> 05:14.782
Look, the only reason
that I was on edge

05:14.882 --> 05:16.817
is because my daughter
was in danger.

05:16.917 --> 05:20.253
Did you blame Bode for that?

05:20.354 --> 05:22.456
JAKE:
No.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.358
I blame Bode
for a lot of things,

05:24.458 --> 05:25.626
but that wasn't one of them.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.696
Of all the people
on that bridge--

05:28.796 --> 05:31.198
Bode's captain, his crew,

05:31.298 --> 05:32.900
his own father--

05:33.000 --> 05:36.704
why do you think Gabriela
was the one who jumped?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.205
GABRIELA:
Bode!

05:40.874 --> 05:42.710
ERIKA:
It's a steep fall.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.112
She must have been scared.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.714
I'm sure she was.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.450
Is she prone to making
rash decisions?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.752
Was that just a yes
to you moving in?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.320
I'm still thinking about it.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.623
No.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.396
ERIKA:
Eve Edwards.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.432
Can't say I ever expected
to see you here.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.867
You surprised I didn't
quit after the academy?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.268
I'm a tough trainer.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.737
(sighs)

06:09.837 --> 06:12.372
You know, it wasn't until
I made it to Station 42

06:12.473 --> 06:14.608
that I was able to get
your voice out of my head,

06:14.708 --> 06:16.209
saying that I didn't
have what it takes

06:16.309 --> 06:18.679
to be in Cal Fire.
The girl I saw was meek,

06:18.779 --> 06:21.148
indecisive, lacked confidence.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.584
Well, that was, that was
five years ago, what...

06:23.684 --> 06:26.454
I'm happy to be proven wrong.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.988
EVE:
We are on Ledgewood

06:28.088 --> 06:30.858
and our leadership is exercising
questionable judgment.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.660
I have an inmate firefighter

06:32.760 --> 06:34.728
hanging off the side
of a damn bridge.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.598
Now, that girl is decisive.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.932
Well, there were lives at stake.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.501
Do you regret
your insubordination?

06:40.601 --> 06:41.869
No. It didn't even do anything.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.236
It got you written up,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.238
which I'm not sure
I even agree with.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.774
A write-up is
a piece of paper.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.577
My call was too late
to be significant,

06:49.677 --> 06:51.512
to stop everything that...

06:51.612 --> 06:54.381
went down after.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.117
The life that was lost.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.252
* *

07:17.505 --> 07:19.973
No, n-no, n-no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

07:43.296 --> 07:44.798
Bode.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.466
Wh...

08:04.484 --> 08:06.587
* *

08:22.369 --> 08:24.738
Bode is a loose cannon.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.939
He's always been.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.975
I don't know, I should have...

08:28.075 --> 08:30.744
should have had him sent back
to prison when I had the chance.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.846
How would you
have done that?

08:38.051 --> 08:40.821
Doesn't matter now.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.057
I didn't report him back then,
I'm not gonna do it now.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.794
(grunting)

08:55.969 --> 08:57.337
Please have a pulse.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.541
Oh, crap.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.377
Okay, airway's intact.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.393
Come on, Bode.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.566
(gurgling, coughs)

09:36.977 --> 09:38.111
I'm alive?

09:38.211 --> 09:41.214
You better be
after I jumped after you.

09:41.314 --> 09:45.118
You jumped to save me?

09:45.218 --> 09:46.887
Why?

09:46.987 --> 09:48.488
You fell

09:48.588 --> 09:51.124
to save Sam, a stranger.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.727
I did the same,

09:53.827 --> 09:56.496
except you're no stranger.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.066
Where are we?

10:00.567 --> 10:03.270
We went downstream,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.538
a few miles, maybe.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.174
* Tracing our life... *

10:07.274 --> 10:10.377
I'm guessing my dad
didn't sanction you jumping.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.813
I'd never ask you
to do any of this for me.

10:12.913 --> 10:16.483
Well, it's a good thing I didn't
give you a chance to say no.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.986
* Truth in our eyes *

10:19.086 --> 10:20.888
* Maybe... *

10:20.988 --> 10:23.423
Did I hurt your rib?

10:23.523 --> 10:26.059
It happens. Not your fault.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.468
Where are you going?

10:35.568 --> 10:37.170
You're hurt.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.172
Ribs will heal themselves.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.409
We got to get out
of these woods

10:42.509 --> 10:43.811
and get back to the road
before it gets dark.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.147
We should s-stay.
They're gonna...

10:47.247 --> 10:48.782
They'll be looking for us.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.151
They're gonna check the water
first, and then they're...

10:51.251 --> 10:52.753
they're gonna do a grid search

10:52.853 --> 10:55.422
and follow the river
until they find us.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.190
That'll take way too long.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.525
Night's gonna fall.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.093
You're soaking.
You're gonna freeze.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.528
You too.

11:01.628 --> 11:02.930
Don't worry about me.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.098
I don't-I don't want
to be responsible

11:05.198 --> 11:07.667
for hurting you
or anybody ever again.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.204
We got to walk east and then
we'll eventually hit the road.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.007
We can flag someone
down and call 911.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.144
Yeah, um...

11:18.311 --> 11:20.613
We'll rescue ourselves,

11:20.714 --> 11:22.983
and then we'll let your dad

11:23.083 --> 11:24.818
yell at us both.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.624
Well, let's go.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.395
ERIKA:
Bode's record at Three Rock

11:35.495 --> 11:38.031
is a gripping read.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.633
Well, fire camp's
not the academy.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.403
No. It's stricter.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.938
Or it's supposed to be.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.341
Bode wandered out and met
someone on an open road.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.844
He assaulted
a firefighter.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.445
Did Jake tell you that?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.981
Lucky guess.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.384
I thought you were on our side.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.119
I am,

11:59.219 --> 12:02.622
but I can't help if I don't
have the whole truth.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.358
So, tell me.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.895
You had plenty of opportunities

12:07.995 --> 12:10.230
to send Bode packing.
Why didn't you?

12:11.464 --> 12:12.866
Manny, I'm sick.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.569
Because he's a damn good
firefighter.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.205
But he's also reckless.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.673
That doesn't explain
why you kept him.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.575
And if I'm asking,

12:22.675 --> 12:24.912
so will the victim's lawyers.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.017
I think I need a minute.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.986
SHARON:
You and Manny need to get
your stories straight

12:33.086 --> 12:34.754
or that woman
is gonna eat you alive.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.224
I know her.
She's a human lie detector.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.159
Manny won't listen to me.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.394
Just like he wouldn't
listen to me out there.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.263
Hey, lower your voice.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.532
Hey, Sharon.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.601
Can I talk to you real quick?
Of course.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.241
You can't tell her anything.
I'm gonna tell her.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.876
What?
What?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.345
She can't know
what you did.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.947
I think she'll understand.

13:00.047 --> 13:03.116
No, she won't. No one will.
We're firefighters.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.419
Sharon, Bode put us all in
a very difficult position here.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.990
You think Bode's the problem?
That's not what I'm...

13:10.090 --> 13:12.792
You know that I'm grateful that
you took a chance on me, right?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.461
You have a strange
way of showing it.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.397
Sharon, that's how you're
gonna come at me right now?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.731
Because it was
my gratitude

13:18.832 --> 13:19.967
that kept him here
in the first place.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.134
And I shouldn't have done that,

13:21.234 --> 13:22.669
but I did it
because you asked me to,

13:22.769 --> 13:23.837
and you shouldn't
have done that.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.772
Don't make it worse for us.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.609
(sighs)
I got to-I got to te...

13:29.709 --> 13:31.211
I got to tell the truth.
No, Manny,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.446
you are gonna give her the
sword to stab you with.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.814
I have to.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.624
(Gabriela coughing)

13:48.295 --> 13:50.230
Are you cold?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.764
A little.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.135
It's only gonna get worse
now that it's getting dark.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.705
We could huddle together

13:58.805 --> 14:01.174
for some body heat.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.421
(crying in distance)

14:14.521 --> 14:15.855
Do you hear that?

14:15.956 --> 14:18.191
(crying continues)

14:23.730 --> 14:26.433
Sounds like a baby.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.835
It can't be.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.837
It could be coyotes.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.506
Hey, someone
out there?

14:33.606 --> 14:34.807
WOMAN:
Oh, thank God.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.344
Please help me.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.680
I can't move very well, and
I think my leg might be broken.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.749
What are you even doing here?

14:42.849 --> 14:44.384
I was hiking.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.518
In heels?

14:45.618 --> 14:47.554
Those

14:47.654 --> 14:49.222
facial lacerations--

14:49.322 --> 14:51.558
that must have
been some fall.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.126
Yeah.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.967
You're the driver from
the car wreck on the bridge.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.702
You're the hit-and-run driver?

15:02.802 --> 15:05.038
You're the reason
we're even out here.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.050
I'm so sorry.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.652
The turn was so sharp
I lost control of the car.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.421
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.991
That turn is too sharp,
but you were also speeding.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.526
I know. I'm sorry.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.395
And you ran from the scene.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.730
This month, I had to pick
between rent money

15:30.830 --> 15:32.932
and car insurance.
I picked rent.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.901
I thought, if I stay,

15:35.002 --> 15:36.569
I go to prison.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.907
I was scared to see
what damage I caused.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.943
Did I kill anyone?

15:44.044 --> 15:46.279
We got everyone out alive.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.281
(sighs)

15:48.381 --> 15:50.417
Oh, thank God.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.153
What's your name?

15:53.253 --> 15:54.754
Meg.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.059
You'll still help me, right?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.728
I can't walk on my own.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.998
I'm so sorry.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.339
I'm Bode,
this is Gabriela,

16:12.439 --> 16:13.973
and of course
we'll help you.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.109
Thank you.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.845
(crying)

16:18.945 --> 16:22.182
Some people see you
as a hall monitor,

16:22.282 --> 16:23.916
but I know better.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.652
You're one of us.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.753
(sighs)

16:26.853 --> 16:28.688
No wonder everyone
loves you.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.424
This department,
this town.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.894
A lot of people would be
willing to do you favors.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.230
And sometimes
you let them, right?

16:38.165 --> 16:41.501
Is that what Manny told you--
that he offered?

16:41.601 --> 16:45.372
Oh, that's very nice
but that's not true.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.475
I asked him to keep Bode
at Three Rock.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.544
And because you asked him

16:51.644 --> 16:54.281
Captain Perez
chose to ignore the fact

16:54.381 --> 16:56.015
that your son's broken
multiple rules?

16:56.116 --> 16:59.786
I saw a chance
to keep my incarcerated son,

16:59.886 --> 17:03.256
my only living child,
close to home,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.992
so I asked an old friend
for a favor.

17:06.093 --> 17:09.296
Does he often
bend the rules like that?

17:10.663 --> 17:13.333
Like going over a bridge
to save someone's life?

17:13.433 --> 17:16.969
Way more often than I would
like, but that's who Bode is.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.838
I'm talking about Captain Perez.

17:18.938 --> 17:22.175
Does he have a habit
of circumventing protocol?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.711
You think they could
pin this whole thing on Manny?

17:24.811 --> 17:26.746
Tell me what happened out there

17:26.846 --> 17:29.549
and I'll answer
that question.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.221
(crying)
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:35.188 --> 17:38.491
VINCE:
Sharon, Swift Water
Rescue is back.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.927
No sign of them, still?

17:41.027 --> 17:43.062
(indistinct chatter)

17:44.597 --> 17:47.434
Swift found Bode's
shirt washed up.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.803
Is there an implication here?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.273
We have to consider the
possibility that they drowned.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.475
Is there any other
implication here?

17:55.575 --> 17:56.809
Your son's an inmate.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.278
He could be using this
as an opportunity...

17:58.378 --> 17:59.679
Oh, I dare you
to finish that sentence.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.081
If they somehow made it
out of the water,

18:02.182 --> 18:04.451
they've been walking around
in the cold, soaking wet.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.419
We're likely looking
at two hypothermic,

18:06.519 --> 18:08.355
disoriented,
injured persons.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.458
And in this weather...

18:11.558 --> 18:12.959
I don't know how they
make it through the night.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.027
Because we are professional
search and rescuers.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.164
So, we search
and then we rescue them.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.531
MANNY:
Hey, Chief.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.699
Search perimeter's
too far out.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.733
We don't have
the manpower.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.135
Perimeter's not the problem.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.137
Those rapids were
challenging even for our Zodiac.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.872
You know what, bro, my daughter
didn't swim in the Olympics

18:25.972 --> 18:27.340
just so she could
drown in Edgewater.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.641
She's out here
somewhere.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.144
With my son, and
we're going to find them.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.680
Right?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.416
I'm requesting volunteer fire
department for extra eyes.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.018
And I'm calling in
the K-9, too.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.791
All right, Meg, we're gonna
stabilize your leg

18:44.891 --> 18:47.093
with a makeshift splint, okay?

18:47.194 --> 18:48.895
It'll get us moving.
Mm-hmm.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.330
(grunts)

18:50.430 --> 18:51.798
I keep hearing animals.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.233
Lot of wildlife
out here.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.701
This is karma.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.836
I'm a horrible person
who fled a scene

18:56.936 --> 18:59.172
and I'm gonna die
out here in the dirt.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.873
Well, look,

19:00.973 --> 19:03.243
I'm an expert
on self-punishment.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.711
Okay? I get it.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.214
Right now, we just...
we got to keep working.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.382
Deep breath, okay?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.651
Okay.
(deep inhale)

19:11.751 --> 19:14.487
(winces)
You could go

19:14.587 --> 19:16.623
get some help while
I stay here with Meg.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.992
No, I'm-I'm not leaving you.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.097
Either of you.
MEG: He's right.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.866
You two save people.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.402
The world's not losing
a firefighter 'cause of me.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.938
Least I can do
is limp through this.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.640
BODE:
Listen, we need to-we need
to start moving faster.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.375
Can't have anybody
getting hypothermia.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.676
That's a good call.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.278
We could
keep each other talking,

19:38.378 --> 19:40.580
uh, stay alert.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.082
So, you're
a firefighting couple?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.719
You two have a baby, it would
be like having the baby Jesus.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.723
It's, uh, it's not like that.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.592
We're-we're friends.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.995
You jumped in the river
for "just friends"?

19:56.095 --> 19:58.698
Not quite.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.235
Friends talk, even if it was
just on the phone.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.537
We just see each other at work.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.507
I think what Bode's
trying to say

20:07.607 --> 20:09.842
is that we're coworkers.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.245
(Meg coughs)

20:12.345 --> 20:13.613
Ready? Let's go.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.782
Good? I'll help
you up. Hold on.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.617
Okay.
That's it, right?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.018
Mm-hmm.
Two...

20:19.118 --> 20:21.554
Three.
(grunts)

20:21.654 --> 20:23.723
Ooh! (panting)

20:23.823 --> 20:26.259
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.362
(indistinct shouting)

20:29.462 --> 20:31.998
Gabriela!
Bode!

20:34.567 --> 20:36.769
Gabriela!

20:39.672 --> 20:42.342
We've only covered
20% of the grid, Chief.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.210
We need more people searching.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.578
FREDDY:
Yo, Cap!

20:45.678 --> 20:46.846
We're here.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.315
EVE:
I took the crew back to camp,

20:48.415 --> 20:50.016
like you asked me to, but...

20:50.116 --> 20:51.484
We heard about
the search for Bode.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.652
And if Cap's looking
for his daughter,

20:52.752 --> 20:54.186
then we're looking, too.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.158
Thank you, firefighters.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.394
(indistinct chatter)

21:01.494 --> 21:03.896
EVE: Let's go.
WOMAN: Gabriela!

21:03.996 --> 21:05.665
Gabriela!

21:05.765 --> 21:08.368
Bode!
Bode!

21:08.468 --> 21:11.804
(grunts) Aah!

21:11.904 --> 21:14.006
Are we lost?
No.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.776
(grunts)

21:16.876 --> 21:19.178
MEG: Oh, no.
GABRIELA: Bode, are you okay?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.716
This is a bad idea. We should
just wait for the rescue team.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.918
We'll freeze to death.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.821
Leave me behind.
I'm slowing you down.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.256
This is all my fault.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.525
Just help me light a fire
to keep the animals away,

21:32.625 --> 21:34.361
and then go get help.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.662
We shouldn't split up,

21:35.762 --> 21:37.697
but stopping to light a fire
is a good idea.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.066
If we stop, we'll die.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.670
You're hypothermic.
You're not thinking clearly.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.472
It's not hypothermia.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.107
Shivering? Check.
Stumbling? Check.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.308
Confusion...

21:49.409 --> 21:50.743
No, listen, we-we
just, we got to keep

21:50.843 --> 21:52.345
going uphill, okay?

21:52.445 --> 21:53.646
I can't see the stars
right now to tell

21:53.746 --> 21:55.047
which way is north.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.983
(coughs)

21:58.184 --> 22:00.086
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

22:00.186 --> 22:03.322
All right, guys,
everyone closer together.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.324
Keep an eye on
the person next to you.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.593
(shouting): Bode!

22:06.693 --> 22:08.595
Gabriella!

22:08.695 --> 22:12.131
Chief, I'm pulling my unit.
Shift's up.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.701
Wait, no.
You can't do that, man.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.836
The dogs are tired.
It's only gonna get worse.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.171
The heavy rain
is gonna suppress the scent

22:19.271 --> 22:22.241
and the strong winds
won't help either.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.976
Our crews need a break, too.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.478
So, what, we're just
gonna give up?

22:25.578 --> 22:27.714
No, I'm not giving up.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.449
I'm not resting
until I find my kid,

22:29.549 --> 22:31.451
but we can't ask our crews
to do the same, okay,

22:31.551 --> 22:32.885
it's been too many hours.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.253
Yeah, too many hours,
which means that Bode

22:34.353 --> 22:35.455
and Gabriela are already
out of time, Chief.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.956
We need to find them.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.894
Or we got to make them find us.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.162
Freddy, come here.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.664
Yes, sir.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.332
Turn around.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.202
Manny, what are you doing?

22:50.302 --> 22:52.939
Cal Fire--
they got a prescribed burn

22:53.039 --> 22:54.674
scheduled for just a mile
from here tomorrow.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.543
I'm gonna start it early.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.110
No.
FREDDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.712
We starting a fire out here?
That's right.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.681
Hey, good idea. Bode's
rubbing off on you, Cap.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.684
No, no!
We are not doing that.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.619
The burn's already
permitted, Chief.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.387
But we're not the ones
permitted to do it.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.490
We got no resources, no backups.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.591
That fire gets out of control,

23:11.691 --> 23:12.859
we got no way to stop it, Manny.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.661
The road's just
right there, man.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.429
It's gonna act
as a natural line.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.565
Come on, Vince, it's the only
way our kids are gonna be able

23:18.665 --> 23:19.899
to know how to find us.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.705
Screw this.
Three Rock, who's with me?

23:25.805 --> 23:26.839
Hell yeah, I am.
Let's do it.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.140
Chief, what are we doing?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.476
All right, let...

23:29.576 --> 23:30.910
Manny. Manny.
What? What?

23:32.579 --> 23:34.413
You want to do this,

23:34.514 --> 23:35.648
I'm not gonna try and stop you.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.349
But I can't
get my crew involved.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.455
Understood.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.923
But plan on thanking me later.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.292
Grab your tools, guys, let's go.
FREDDY: Let's go.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.695
SHARON:
Captain Perez is a good man.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.563
He runs into those flames
when every other

23:50.663 --> 23:52.264
living thing is running out.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.701
And he built
a really loyal crew,

23:54.801 --> 23:56.302
so don't even think about
trying to get

23:56.402 --> 23:57.504
one of his guys to flip.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.305
I'm not trying to flip anybody.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.642
He's as devoted a captain
and a firefighter

24:02.742 --> 24:04.043
as he is a father.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.613
Captain Perez
made many exceptions

24:06.713 --> 24:08.080
for your child. And...

24:08.180 --> 24:11.283
if he would do that for
someone else's kid...

24:14.186 --> 24:16.322
...how far would he go
for his own?

24:31.871 --> 24:34.140
(Meg screams)

24:34.240 --> 24:36.208
Oh, my God!

24:36.308 --> 24:39.345
Something hurts worse.
I'm so sorry.

24:39.445 --> 24:40.547
I have to stop.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.515
(grunts)
Here. Okay?

24:42.615 --> 24:45.051
Slow. Slow. Go slow.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.987
(panting)

24:55.361 --> 24:56.996
Is the swelling normal?

24:57.096 --> 24:59.098
Uh, a little,

24:59.198 --> 25:01.033
but, uh, this much, no.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.937
I can't get a distal pulse.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.039
Meg, can you feel this?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.675
All I feel is pain.

25:08.775 --> 25:09.876
Skin looks really pale.

25:09.976 --> 25:13.646
Paleness... paleness is...
(coughs)

25:13.746 --> 25:17.049
paleness is a sign,
along with pain and pulse.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.952
There's five of them, and I...
I... They all start with a P,

25:20.052 --> 25:22.622
but I can't...
I can't remember the other two.

25:22.722 --> 25:26.058
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

25:26.158 --> 25:27.827
What does she need?

25:27.927 --> 25:29.461
I'm a probie.

25:29.562 --> 25:30.897
I barely have
any medical training.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.298
I have no idea
what I'm talking about, Bode.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.866
Doesn't sound that way to me.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.535
Yeah, because I've-I've read up,
I've watched tutorials.

25:36.636 --> 25:37.837
I know the theory.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.372
I... (coughs)
Tell me the theory.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.877
It's-it's compartment syndrome.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.780
With bone fractures,
tissues from the bone

25:47.880 --> 25:51.050
seep into the blood, cau...

25:51.150 --> 25:54.353
causing so much swelling that
it cuts off the circulation.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.488
If it's not treated,
she could lose a leg.

25:56.589 --> 25:59.692
Or even worse, she could die.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.360
She needs help right now,
and I-I can't...

26:01.460 --> 26:04.931
Hey, hey.
It's just a theory.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.066
How is it treated?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.068
A fasciotomy.

26:09.168 --> 26:13.640
You cut into the leg
and relieve the pressure.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.309
But that needs to be done
in a hospital by a doctor.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.978
Can it wait?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.281
In theory?

26:22.381 --> 26:25.251
No. No, it can't wait.

26:25.351 --> 26:26.552
SHARON:
And then she said

26:26.653 --> 26:28.154
she was gonna
call another witness.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.022
Who is it?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.592
She's gonna find out, Sharon.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.028
And my career's over.

26:36.128 --> 26:39.465
I mean, how the hell
do I explain starting a fire?

26:40.867 --> 26:42.501
Am I gonna go back
to jail, Chief?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.637
SHARON:
Okay, Manny, she's on our side.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.505
She's trying to contain
a lawsuit.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.540
Sharon...

26:48.641 --> 26:50.542
you've been in
administration too long.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.511
Should have just
kept my stupid mouth shut

26:52.611 --> 26:53.913
like you told me to.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.048
Okay, what if this
other witness

26:56.148 --> 26:57.349
is some other angle?

26:57.449 --> 26:58.484
What if this witness is...

26:58.584 --> 27:00.687
Exactly who she needs
to nail me.

27:05.992 --> 27:08.127
This was supposed
to be a controlled burn.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.628
It's spinning out fast.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.833
The fire's jumped.
Freddy, over here.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.869
Jump in on this, here, come on.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.412
Shovels over here!

27:26.512 --> 27:28.748
Go, go, go, go, go!

27:30.316 --> 27:31.851
MANNY:
Hey, stomp that out.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.352
FREDDY:
Cap, these hand tools are not
enough. We need water.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.621
MANNY:
That's good, crew.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.262
You're out of your
damn mind, Manny.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.563
This is out of control.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.432
But I can't let you
hang for it.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.034
FIREFIGHTER:
Watch out. (mutters)

27:48.134 --> 27:49.368
(radio chatter)

27:49.468 --> 27:50.937
Hey, hey, spot fire.
Watch out, watch out.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.410
Starting to regret
volunteering for this.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.746
You volunteered?

27:59.846 --> 28:03.182
What can I say?
I like Bode too much.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.084
Hey, well, I know the feeling.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.618
Yeah, but I didn't
also think that

28:06.719 --> 28:08.487
we were searching
for my competition.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.689
Cap's daughter?

28:13.092 --> 28:15.494
I mean, anyone can see they've
got eyes for each other.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.799
Uh...

28:19.899 --> 28:21.200
that's my girlfriend.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.103
I... Shoot, I'm sorry. I...

28:24.203 --> 28:27.506
I didn't realize, and
I'm probably wrong, so...

28:27.606 --> 28:30.910
Well, let's hope so.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.712
For both our sake.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.025
Okay.

28:46.125 --> 28:49.695
I can disinfect the eyebrow
razor with hand sanitizer.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.030
Clean the skin before you cut

28:51.130 --> 28:53.032
so it doesn't get infected.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.702
Okay.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.113
Ready?

29:07.213 --> 29:09.181
Uh-huh.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.785
You got this.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.625
Okay.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.198
(Meg crying out, groaning)

29:41.480 --> 29:42.815
Ah, that feels better,

29:42.915 --> 29:46.218
which is crazy 'cause you just
sliced my leg open.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.320
(sighs)

29:49.721 --> 29:52.558
Her distal pulse is back.
It worked.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.061
That was incredible.

29:58.597 --> 29:59.966
You smell that?

30:00.066 --> 30:01.767
Smell what?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.905
(coughs)
Gab.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.473
(coughs)

30:07.573 --> 30:09.275
That fire's probably
only a mile away.

30:09.375 --> 30:13.245
Oh. I've never been
so happy to see smoke.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.981
That's our North Star.

30:15.081 --> 30:16.782
Where there's smoke,
there's Cal Fire.

30:16.883 --> 30:19.185
We can get there by morning.
Let's go.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.554
On this search and rescue,
you operated

30:22.654 --> 30:25.091
under Captain Perez's
leadership, correct?

30:25.191 --> 30:26.926
Yes.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.929
Then you saw him light the fire.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.208
I have nothing
but good things to say

30:42.308 --> 30:45.344
about the way Captain Perez
conducted himself that night,

30:45.444 --> 30:46.913
and in general.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.314
And if you don't mind,

30:48.414 --> 30:50.516
that's all I'm gonna say
without a lawyer present.

30:50.616 --> 30:53.452
Because I don't want this to go
the way these things go.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.154
These things?

30:55.254 --> 30:58.324
I'm in prison
for something I didn't do.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.725
I know how this goes down.

30:59.825 --> 31:02.294
How does this go down?

31:03.996 --> 31:06.198
You stand there
and ask me questions

31:06.298 --> 31:08.600
in just the right way
to make me say something

31:08.700 --> 31:10.169
I don't want to say

31:10.269 --> 31:13.339
and trick me into confirming
whatever theory

31:13.439 --> 31:14.840
you got going on.

31:14.941 --> 31:18.244
And suddenly I'm under
a bus I never saw coming.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.246
Or someone else is.

31:25.985 --> 31:29.655
I don't want
to trick you, Freddy.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.690
I want to know

31:31.790 --> 31:34.460
what happened that night.

31:35.261 --> 31:38.297
Next you're gonna tell me
you're on my side.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.136
I am on your side.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.906
And what I think
I'm hearing you say

31:48.007 --> 31:50.442
is that while you were
combing through the grid

31:50.542 --> 31:53.079
that had been set up as part of
the search and rescue operation,

31:53.179 --> 31:55.847
you spotted a fire in the woods

31:55.948 --> 31:57.916
that started spontaneously.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.019
With the storm,
it would make sense.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.954
Lightning struck
and started a brush fire.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.755
Thank goodness
you were all nearby

32:03.855 --> 32:05.992
and could get it
under control quickly.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.028
(recorder beeps)

32:09.128 --> 32:13.032
So, tell me, what happened?

32:15.334 --> 32:18.004
We made it
through the night.
We're almost there.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.306
(sirens wailing in distance)
Are those sirens?

32:20.406 --> 32:21.974
You'll be punished,
but I promise,

32:22.074 --> 32:23.109
what you're doing
to yourself inside

32:23.209 --> 32:24.376
is way worse, trust me.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.178
(grunts)
Gab! Here, stop.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.014
Hey, hey, you okay? You okay?
(groaning)

32:28.114 --> 32:29.915
Hey, talk to me. Talk to me.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.550
Talk to me. What's wrong?
What's wrong?

32:31.650 --> 32:33.052
Gab.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.624
She's unconscious
and she's barely breathing.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.526
I can't lose her!

32:40.626 --> 32:42.628
Leave me. Take her.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.863
Af-After everything
you've done for me,

32:44.963 --> 32:46.198
it's the least I can do.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.936
I'll-I'll come
back for you.
Okay.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.049
I had to make a choice.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.852
I don't know
if it was the right one.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.520
I don't know either.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.691
BODE:
All I could think of
was saving Gabriela.

33:12.791 --> 33:15.061
I couldn't see anything else.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.946
* *

33:42.888 --> 33:45.924
* *

33:59.805 --> 34:02.574
I got her. I got her.
What's wrong with her?

34:02.674 --> 34:04.343
I don't know. I don't
know. She was fine.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.878
She... she was coughing some,
but she was able to walk,

34:06.978 --> 34:08.847
and then she just...
she just started wheezing.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.716
Sounds like
secondary drowning.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.651
There's water in her lungs

34:12.751 --> 34:14.920
because she jumped off
that damn bridge.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.888
JAKE:
Tell the paramedics
they need to have O2 ready.

34:16.988 --> 34:18.324
Her pulse is racing.

34:18.424 --> 34:19.791
There's still-there's still
another injured civilian

34:19.891 --> 34:21.593
that's down there.
Civilian?

34:21.693 --> 34:23.395
The hit-and-run driver.
Eve.

34:23.495 --> 34:24.930
Arthur, come on.
All right, yeah.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.465
She was in-she was in
better shape than Gabriela,

34:26.565 --> 34:27.766
so I grabbed Gabriela

34:27.866 --> 34:29.301
and I started...
I just started running.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.002
We tried to fix her broken leg
and her compartment syndrome

34:31.103 --> 34:34.039
as best that we could.
Okay, okay.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.108
You have to save her.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.943
JAKE:
Somebody get me
a warming blanket.

34:38.043 --> 34:40.479
Gabs, listen to our
voice. Come on.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.215
Come on, open your
eyes. Come on.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.518
BODE:
At the time,
Gabriela had collapsed.

34:46.618 --> 34:50.656
I didn't know what it was.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.691
Meg was fine.
She was up and,

34:52.791 --> 34:54.326
and she was talking.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.461
But as it turns out,

34:55.561 --> 34:58.330
she was bleeding
internally.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.866
We had no way of knowing.

35:00.966 --> 35:04.536
She was a traumatized
civilian.

35:05.637 --> 35:09.241
And you are an incarcerated
firefighter

35:09.341 --> 35:12.678
who made all the choices
that led to her death.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.981
At least that's how
her parents' lawyers see it.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.185
I am deeply sorry.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.823
I liked Meg.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.727
She made a mistake.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.431
I did my best to try
and give her a long life

35:32.531 --> 35:34.500
to overcome it.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.603
GUARD:
Okay, Donovan, back to camp.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.423
GABRIELA:
Bode?

35:57.523 --> 36:01.360
No, it's me, Jake.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.463
MANNY:
You're gonna be okay, mija.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.199
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

36:07.299 --> 36:08.867
She awake?
Yeah.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.703
If I don't make it...
BODE:
You're g-you're gonna make it.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.072
I'm gonna call
and check on you so many times

36:14.172 --> 36:17.509
you'll be sick of me.
What a friend would do.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.878
(indistinct chatter)

36:29.087 --> 36:31.156
(engine starts)
(siren chirps)

36:37.095 --> 36:37.996
(clears throat)

36:38.096 --> 36:40.232
After speaking
with all of you,

36:40.332 --> 36:41.833
I have some recommendations.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.371
Eve, I'm undoing
your write-up.

36:45.471 --> 36:48.707
I strongly recommend that
you climb the Cal Fire ladder.

36:48.807 --> 36:52.177
You're an asset,
firefighter.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.780
Jake...

36:54.880 --> 36:57.283
despite your personal
entanglement with both

36:57.383 --> 36:59.017
MIA firefighters,

36:59.117 --> 37:01.553
you put your badge
before your heart.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.657
DC Leone,

37:05.757 --> 37:08.527
I look forward to you
returning to work.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.228
The department
will be stronger for it.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.298
Battalion Chief Leone,

37:12.398 --> 37:15.133
your leadership style--
it deviates from the handbook,

37:15.233 --> 37:18.437
but there's no bottling
this job in a handbook.

37:18.537 --> 37:19.771
I get that.

37:22.708 --> 37:23.975
Cap.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.379
There's a narrative here
that you started

37:27.479 --> 37:29.548
a prescribed fire early,

37:29.648 --> 37:32.083
an incredibly reckless choice.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.887
But there's another narrative
that suggests

37:35.987 --> 37:39.658
lightning started a brush fire
that you put out.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.228
That's what Freddy said.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.433
Like I said, my goal
is to protect you.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.200
Protect us, Cal Fire.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.637
So that's it, then?
We're good?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.739
If it were up to me, yes.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.874
But I'm afraid
there are parents and lawyers

37:55.974 --> 37:58.977
who won't rest until
someone goes down for this.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.246
My recommendation is Bode.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.948
No! What?
Oh, God.

38:03.048 --> 38:06.051
ERIKA:
He's an inmate who directly
treated the deceased civilian.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.320
He-He's a small loss
to the department

38:08.420 --> 38:11.357
compared to any of you,
and from what I've gathered,

38:11.457 --> 38:12.924
Bode's been on thin ice before.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.726
(door closes)
VINCE: I was the one.

38:14.826 --> 38:17.262
It was me.
Write that down.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.831
Tell the parents
to tell the lawyers...
Chief...

38:19.931 --> 38:21.667
Bode covered for me

38:21.767 --> 38:24.403
i-in saying that he treated Meg.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.238
He rescued Meg.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.074
I treated her.

38:29.174 --> 38:31.477
So...

38:31.577 --> 38:33.579
truth is, her...

38:33.679 --> 38:35.747
Her death is my fault.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.617
There's no evidence
to support that.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.519
Listen...

38:40.619 --> 38:42.554
I can lose my job.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.590
That's okay.
I'll-I'll figure it out.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.426
But my son
cannot go back to prison.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.061
That will kill my wife.

38:50.929 --> 38:54.533
I'm sorry. it's over.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.435
Bode's done.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.142
Uh, all right,
can I just, um...

39:05.611 --> 39:07.913
Can I...
(sighs)

39:08.013 --> 39:10.348
Can I just ask for one favor?

39:13.952 --> 39:17.022
No parent should have to
bury their child.

39:19.658 --> 39:23.429
It's unnatural.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.664
And it's cruel.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.099
And I'm sure you're
struggling right now

39:28.199 --> 39:32.904
with why it happened
to your family.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.741
Happened to mine, too.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.677
You lost a child?

39:38.777 --> 39:40.779
* And I can't change... *

39:40.879 --> 39:42.714
Yeah.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.382
My daughter.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.918
When we first lost her,
I thought I could

39:47.018 --> 39:49.087
punch my way through the pain.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.956
But...

39:51.056 --> 39:53.358
just made everything worse.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.860
If you're trying
to talk us out of this...

39:54.960 --> 39:58.464
Shh, Charles,
just let him talk.

40:01.332 --> 40:04.335
This lawsuit-- it-it
doesn't just sue

40:04.436 --> 40:07.238
a nameless, faceless
organization.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.207
It's got a-a person's
name attached to it,

40:09.307 --> 40:13.111
and that-that name is
shaping up to be my son.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.882
Um, he and I,

40:16.982 --> 40:20.118
we rarely see
eye to eye on anything,

40:20.218 --> 40:23.689
but what he did out there
for your daughter, what...

40:23.789 --> 40:26.091
He did-he did everything right.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.727
He killed our daughter.
No.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.463
Meg succumbed
to internal bleeding

40:31.563 --> 40:33.298
after she walked away
from the crash.

40:33.398 --> 40:35.901
Please believe me, I'm not-I'm
not blaming your daughter,

40:36.001 --> 40:38.804
but if you blame my son...

40:40.539 --> 40:42.708
...Cal Fire loses

40:42.808 --> 40:45.043
a very valuable firefighter.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.814
And that could put
somebody else's kid

40:48.914 --> 40:50.081
at risk someday.

40:50.181 --> 40:53.585
* To a brighter place... *

40:53.685 --> 40:55.086
And worst of all, it's not...

40:55.186 --> 40:57.288
not gonna bring Meg back.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.660
You got to grieve
your daughter,

41:01.760 --> 41:03.662
love each other.

41:03.762 --> 41:06.064
Blaming the wrong person--

41:06.164 --> 41:08.900
that's-that's not gonna
make anything better.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.172
* All of these chains *

41:14.272 --> 41:17.142
* Weighing down... *

41:17.242 --> 41:19.244
I'll talk to the lawyers.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.548
(sniffles)

41:22.648 --> 41:25.751
* All of these chains *

41:25.851 --> 41:28.887
You want to tell
me about her?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.122
What was she like?

41:33.559 --> 41:36.595
* I'm down on my knees *
(knock on door)

41:36.695 --> 41:39.130
* I need some relief *

41:39.230 --> 41:43.268
* Some quiet and peace... *

41:43.368 --> 41:44.736
Hey.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.006
* I've been here before... *

41:48.106 --> 41:50.175
Hey, how are you feeling?

41:50.275 --> 41:53.011
So much better
being out of the hospital.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.913
(chuckles softly)

41:55.013 --> 41:58.684
I missed you.

41:58.784 --> 41:59.885
I came straight here.

41:59.985 --> 42:02.988
* Weighing down on me *

42:03.088 --> 42:04.355
* Weighing down *

42:04.455 --> 42:06.558
I missed you, too.

42:08.293 --> 42:10.762
* All of these chains *

42:10.862 --> 42:12.263
* Weighing down *

42:12.363 --> 42:14.032
But, um...

42:14.132 --> 42:16.067
* Weighing down... *

42:16.167 --> 42:18.136
...are you sure
you're feeling better?

42:19.037 --> 42:20.038
Seriously.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.406
* All of these chains... *

42:21.506 --> 42:23.809
I'm horrified

42:23.909 --> 42:25.343
that we lost Meg

42:25.443 --> 42:28.513
after all of that,
and it's gonna

42:28.614 --> 42:31.182
take me a while to shake that.
Yeah.

42:31.282 --> 42:36.554
But... physically, I'm good.

42:36.655 --> 42:39.658
* Weighing down... *

42:39.758 --> 42:42.493
Okay.

42:49.134 --> 42:51.436
Then we need to talk.

42:54.305 --> 42:55.807
About?

42:55.907 --> 42:58.376
You and Bode.
