WEBVTT

00:02.940 --> 00:05.889
He's a gentleman, isn't he?
So, what do you say?

00:05.891 --> 00:06.872
How do, sir?

00:06.874 --> 00:09.114
Too many questions.

00:09.937 --> 00:12.091
A young girl has come to me for protection.

00:12.093 --> 00:13.691
I need somewhere to place her.

00:13.693 --> 00:16.430
I have promised Mr Marlott that I
will look after you.

00:16.432 --> 00:19.053
It's not his, though, is it?
Please help me.

00:20.054 --> 00:23.385
- Frankenstein?
- Contains references to Galvanism, sir.

00:23.387 --> 00:25.971
- Do you know much about it?
- Not my subject, I am afraid.

00:25.973 --> 00:29.811
- What brings you here, Mr Marlott?
- A crime I am investigating.

00:29.813 --> 00:31.771
- The missing girl?
- Yes, and others.

00:31.773 --> 00:34.373
Get some clothes.
We are leaving immediately.

00:37.293 --> 00:40.144
- I'll find the killers for you, I swear.
- So, why didn't you?

00:40.146 --> 00:41.095
I'm scared of them.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.740
The man you are looking for, I think
I have found a way to get to him.

00:44.742 --> 00:45.811
Billy the childcatcher.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.413
That's my guess.

00:48.253 --> 00:49.933
Is that where he is?

02:26.893 --> 02:29.413
Oh, he don't like our perfume.

02:30.529 --> 02:33.927
- Why don't you show yourself?
- No orders from you.

02:33.929 --> 02:37.249
- We do the carving down here sawbones.
- All right.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.009
Take off them gloves.

02:54.449 --> 02:57.129
Workman's fingers. He ain't no surgeon.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.182
Then what's he want with a corpse?

03:00.929 --> 03:02.849
He asked you a question.

03:03.609 --> 03:07.809
Company. That's why he's needing fresh.

03:14.289 --> 03:15.889
Company?

03:19.489 --> 03:21.209
Boy or girl?

03:22.369 --> 03:25.083
- Girl, of course.
- No offence, I'm sure.

03:25.085 --> 03:26.883
How old?

03:26.885 --> 03:27.885
16.

03:28.368 --> 03:29.848
Or less.

03:31.848 --> 03:33.633
30 guineas. Up front.

03:33.635 --> 03:36.686
35 guineas. 20 up front.
The rest when you deliver.

03:36.688 --> 03:38.208
On one condition.

03:39.608 --> 03:42.798
- I get to choose.
- He's lying. It's a trick.

03:43.008 --> 03:45.728
No trick. 35 guineas for
the girl of my choice!

03:48.088 --> 03:49.468
Someone in mind, have you?

03:49.470 --> 03:52.519
Not yet, no. But I'll know the tart when I see her.

03:52.521 --> 03:54.806
- Too risky.
- Gut him now.

03:54.808 --> 03:59.328
The surgeons will do you out of business,
but I know others who want what I want.

03:59.767 --> 04:02.647
You do right by me, your trade's secure.

04:13.861 --> 04:17.021
9:00 tomorrow night. At the Fortune.

04:25.048 --> 04:27.831
- So no sign of Billy, then?
- No.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.472
Then maybe he ain't the
one we are looking for.

04:30.474 --> 04:31.410
Billy took Alice.

04:32.362 --> 04:33.284
That much we know.

04:33.286 --> 04:36.539
Just because he isn't down there doesn't
mean he isn't doing business with them.

04:37.248 --> 04:38.941
He may have been supplying children.

04:38.943 --> 04:41.846
So Billy stole them, then they
stitched the pieces together.

04:41.848 --> 04:42.848
Possible.

04:44.368 --> 04:48.928
They deal in corpses. I dare say they are
not scrupled about how they use them.

04:50.352 --> 04:53.848
Either that or they are both
working for someone else.

04:55.408 --> 04:57.568
- You've cut yourself, sir.
- Eh?

05:00.688 --> 05:02.688
Always had leather hands.

05:03.645 --> 05:04.486
God help us.

05:04.488 --> 05:07.455
It's not blood, like paint.

05:09.368 --> 05:11.488
Pure gatherer. Where is he?

05:12.488 --> 05:14.361
Someone let out after you went in.

05:14.363 --> 05:16.766
It must have been him. Cutting his losses.

05:16.768 --> 05:18.086
Where is he? How do I find him?

05:18.088 --> 05:19.459
- Why?
- Why?

05:19.461 --> 05:22.006
If he can lead us to them, we don't
have to go through with this.

05:22.008 --> 05:24.728
He ain't gonna peach, not on that mob.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.926
He sells down the tonners' yard. Borough.

05:29.928 --> 05:34.166
Where it stinks worse than they do.
Maybe that's how he knows them.

05:34.168 --> 05:37.926
They live there? Or somewhere else
the smell of death goes undetected.

05:37.928 --> 05:40.326
You're a death dealer. Think.

05:40.328 --> 05:42.526
How could a crew like that go to ground?

05:42.528 --> 05:45.132
Makes no odds to me cos I ain't
looking for them nowhere.

05:45.134 --> 05:49.406
Aye? Well, wait for them to come
looking for you, then. And they will.

05:49.408 --> 05:51.315
Once they realise we are
not buyers for real.

05:51.317 --> 05:54.326
Or you can meet me here
with them tomorrow night.

05:54.328 --> 05:56.126
- Do what?
- Catch them in the act.

05:56.128 --> 06:00.086
What, you think they are just going
to walk in here and carve someone up?

06:00.088 --> 06:02.888
35 guineas is too much to
pass up, even for that lot.

06:04.208 --> 06:07.768
We need a girl as bait and 20 guineas.

06:08.539 --> 06:10.368
Who's got that kind of coin?

06:15.448 --> 06:17.926
- You wouldn't?
- I will.

06:17.928 --> 06:22.848
If you don't find them first, I'll
get your shit dealer friend to help us do likewise.

06:26.808 --> 06:30.808
If you want to keep your savings,
you'll find Barkiss before tomorrow night.

06:44.539 --> 06:46.341
Please let me stay here with you.

06:49.288 --> 06:52.074
Do you know the trouble I
went to on your behalf?

06:52.076 --> 06:53.467
He gave me this for you.

07:02.235 --> 07:07.411
"Dear Mr Marlott, the girl lost her child
and would not be persuaded to stay."

07:07.413 --> 07:09.406
"She asks to lodge with you."

07:09.408 --> 07:12.648
"Pease join us today for lunch at
one and we can discuss further."

07:13.922 --> 07:15.568
"Yours, Daniel Hervey."

07:19.207 --> 07:20.407
It was an acccident ?

07:24.568 --> 07:26.288
Please don't throw me out, sir.

07:27.608 --> 07:29.088
I feel safe here.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.608
Oh, Agnes.

08:55.608 --> 08:57.208
Forgive me.

09:47.488 --> 09:50.422
- Anyone seen Barkiss?
- Who?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.108
Walks with a stoop.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.178
There's a farthing in it
for you if I can find him.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.166
- I seen him, mister.
- And me!

10:00.168 --> 10:02.646
- Where? When?
- He was here yesterday.

10:02.648 --> 10:05.286
- He comes every week.
- Do you know where he lives?

10:05.288 --> 10:09.965
Dunno, Mr. If it's fresh you want,
I can get you bucketloads.

11:03.015 --> 11:03.975
Sir?

11:13.608 --> 11:14.568
Sir?

11:55.608 --> 11:57.048
Hello, girl.

12:00.728 --> 12:03.248
- What do you want?
- To see you.

12:04.328 --> 12:06.888
Settled... nice and snug.

12:08.688 --> 12:12.374
- How did you find me?
- Magic.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.486
Did he take it yet ?

12:16.488 --> 12:18.328
Or did you sell it to him?

12:20.088 --> 12:23.320
- What?
- Your little thing.

12:24.248 --> 12:27.766
Go away, Bill! Leave me be.

12:30.088 --> 12:31.928
That's harsh, innit?

12:33.408 --> 12:35.528
After all our days together.

12:37.568 --> 12:40.048
Very well. You be that way.

12:42.448 --> 12:44.328
Why can't you just leave me be?

12:47.288 --> 12:50.566
Cos you're mine and I
still got a use for you.

12:50.568 --> 12:55.375
Now... Not a word of this, you hear?

12:55.848 --> 12:57.208
Yeah.

12:58.048 --> 13:02.008
I get wind that you said owt, I'll be back.

13:02.928 --> 13:04.168
And I'll slit you up.

13:05.528 --> 13:09.945
All the way down to you know where.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.143
Mr Marlott for Lord Hervey.

13:40.610 --> 13:42.050
Mr Marlott, my Lord.

13:43.450 --> 13:46.841
- Thank you for coming.
- Bentley, this is Mr Marlott...

13:46.843 --> 13:48.667
Yes, we met.

13:49.672 --> 13:52.193
- Please.
- I won't stay to dine.

13:52.195 --> 13:54.656
But I'd like to thank you
for your invitation.

13:54.658 --> 13:56.473
At least sit with us for a while.

13:56.475 --> 14:00.035
Lloris, take Mr Marlott's hat and gloves.

14:02.995 --> 14:03.955
Sir.

14:09.495 --> 14:12.622
- How is the girl?
- Weary.

14:12.624 --> 14:13.913
After what happened.

14:13.915 --> 14:17.793
Mr Marlott has taken a charitable interest
in a young girl who is with child.

14:17.795 --> 14:20.353
Sadly, she miscarried last night.

14:20.355 --> 14:22.754
There was nothing I could have done.
I'm afraid.

14:22.756 --> 14:25.313
It was her clear intention
that the child not be born.

14:25.315 --> 14:27.593
The body answered to the will.

14:27.595 --> 14:29.953
I have seen it many times.

14:29.955 --> 14:33.033
- Was she unmarried?
- I am afraid so.

14:33.035 --> 14:35.035
Well, then it was an act of providence.

14:35.454 --> 14:37.199
Or a blessing in disguise.

14:37.201 --> 14:39.114
Don't believe that, Daniel.

14:39.327 --> 14:43.113
Suffer the little children and
forbid them not to come unto me.

14:43.115 --> 14:44.753
For such is the kingdom of heaven.

14:44.755 --> 14:47.873
Our earthly realm is less benign, however.

14:47.875 --> 14:51.513
Whatever her prospects, they would have
been bleaker still with a bastard.

14:51.515 --> 14:55.633
- Harsh words.
- Unbecoming in mixed company.

14:55.635 --> 14:58.595
Maybe so but true nonetheless.

15:02.275 --> 15:04.633
- You're leaving us, Mr Marlott.
- Forgive me.

15:04.635 --> 15:08.433
My Lord, may I talk to you
in private for a moment?

15:08.435 --> 15:10.033
Of course

15:10.035 --> 15:12.035
Excuse us.

15:19.701 --> 15:23.981
I am truly sorry about the girl, but
she would not be persuaded to stay.

15:24.195 --> 15:28.873
And it's against my principles to
act against the will of a patient.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.435
That's not what I wish
to talk about, my Lord.

15:45.555 --> 15:46.841
Your condition?

15:46.843 --> 15:47.993
No, my Lord.

15:47.995 --> 15:49.673
Galvanism.

15:49.675 --> 15:51.473
Galvanism?

15:51.475 --> 15:52.365
What of it?

15:52.703 --> 15:55.036
You said it was Sir William's speciality.

15:55.861 --> 15:58.812
He wrote his doctoral thesis
on the subject. I read it.

15:58.814 --> 15:59.833
Why?

15:59.835 --> 16:03.586
When we spoke together
about it, he denied it.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.873
He might well.

16:04.875 --> 16:07.361
It was highly controversial.

16:07.363 --> 16:08.516
In what way?

16:10.555 --> 16:14.353
The Galvanists believed they had
found the source of all life.

16:14.355 --> 16:15.873
And had they?

16:15.875 --> 16:20.073
No, they had discovered bioelectrical
currents in the human anatomy.

16:20.075 --> 16:24.873
But their claim caused outrage in
some quarters as you might imagine.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.395
The likes of Sir Bentley, for instance.

16:28.475 --> 16:29.795
And yourself?

16:32.035 --> 16:35.313
My objections are scientific not religious.

16:35.315 --> 16:37.593
But why your interest?

16:37.595 --> 16:39.033
Can you tell me more?

16:39.035 --> 16:43.913
I am afraid not but my
thanks, all the same.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.755
And for what you tried to do for the girl.

16:48.435 --> 16:51.595
Well, then, perhaps you'll
allow me to examine your hand.

16:57.115 --> 16:59.275
How long have you been taking mercury?

17:00.515 --> 17:01.708
Almost a week now.

17:01.710 --> 17:04.393
It brings hallucinations, as you know.

17:04.395 --> 17:07.435
But then so does the disease.

17:10.635 --> 17:14.595
You're fortunate it hasn't invaded
the central nervous system yet.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.073
My mold treatment tastes foul.

17:19.075 --> 17:21.713
I don't understand how it works yet.

17:21.714 --> 17:23.714
But it hardly matters.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.873
Three drops. Three times a day.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.435
When it runs out, I'll
give you more if need be.

17:33.355 --> 17:35.116
You won't mention this?

17:35.118 --> 17:38.302
I treat all my patients
in absolute confidence.

17:39.315 --> 17:40.943
Nor my other business.

17:41.995 --> 17:46.673
You have my word. Will you rejoin us?

17:46.675 --> 17:47.682
No, thank you.

17:47.684 --> 17:49.261
I am sorry to hear it.

17:49.263 --> 17:52.475
I'll have Lloris bring your hat and gloves.

18:01.195 --> 18:02.715
Mr Marlott.

18:04.675 --> 18:06.593
I wanted to say goodbye.

18:06.595 --> 18:08.075
Thank you.

18:10.274 --> 18:13.093
I hope you won't take my
brother's words amiss.

18:13.095 --> 18:14.796
He speaks his mind, my lady.

18:15.155 --> 18:17.353
One of the qualities I love most in him.

18:17.355 --> 18:19.313
But it makes him enemies.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.555
He isn't a politician like Bentley.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.355
Nor I, my lady.

19:30.035 --> 19:32.673
Boz. Funny name.

19:32.675 --> 19:34.673
Nom de plume.

19:34.675 --> 19:38.033
Pen name. Simple and memorable.
What will you have, sir?

19:38.035 --> 19:41.115
None of that piss.
Stout, please, darling.

19:42.228 --> 19:45.073
So, what's this about?

19:45.075 --> 19:47.593
Story I was hoping you might confirm.

19:47.595 --> 19:49.250
The Runners are being wound up

19:49.252 --> 19:52.873
and Sir Robert drawing up plans
for a professional police force.

19:55.348 --> 19:58.188
That's confirmation, I take it.
You can take that how you like.

20:00.715 --> 20:03.195
I've heard he already has
a man in your office.

20:05.515 --> 20:06.475
Marlott?

20:08.448 --> 20:09.888
First name.

20:11.234 --> 20:12.834
Judas, for all I know.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.376
Tell me about him.

20:18.856 --> 20:21.894
I've asked every tanner and
skin trader in the Borough.

20:21.896 --> 20:23.401
Barkiss ain't been there all day.

20:23.403 --> 20:25.854
I've been east to Bethnal
and north to Somers Town.

20:25.856 --> 20:28.534
Time to get your money out of
the bank before it closes?

20:28.536 --> 20:32.281
Without Barkiss, we've got no choice.
We'll need three runners.

20:32.789 --> 20:33.494
Armed.

20:33.496 --> 20:35.254
And a girl.

20:35.256 --> 20:37.534
Flora's back so we can use her.

20:37.536 --> 20:40.694
Back? Sir, she's with child.

20:40.696 --> 20:42.926
Not any more. Since when?

20:42.928 --> 20:44.846
Last night. How?

20:44.848 --> 20:47.126
She miscarried, I am told.

20:47.128 --> 20:50.364
There's girls aplenty on the
streets that we can use.

20:50.366 --> 20:52.246
There's no time! She's ours! She's here!

20:52.248 --> 20:56.446
We'll use her. Fetch her from our
lodgings and prime her on the way.

20:56.448 --> 20:58.806
You! With me!

20:58.808 --> 21:02.446
Sorry but I can't be of service
on this occasion, Mr Marlott.

21:02.448 --> 21:05.406
- All my men are occupied tonight.
- Three runners?

21:05.408 --> 21:08.726
Surely you can spare that for
the Home Secretary's sake?

21:08.728 --> 21:11.207
There is nothing I wouldn't
spare for the sake of that man.

21:11.209 --> 21:13.170
If only it were in my power.

21:14.688 --> 21:16.608
And who has the power here more than you?

21:18.728 --> 21:20.568
You tell me, Mr Marlott.

21:24.528 --> 21:26.126
Sir Robert will hear of this.

21:26.128 --> 21:28.008
Of that, I have no doubt.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.154
Flora!

21:38.408 --> 21:39.368
Flora?

21:44.448 --> 21:47.008
Why didn't you answer me?

21:49.928 --> 21:51.408
What's this for?

21:56.094 --> 21:57.393
I'm scared.

21:57.395 --> 21:58.456
Of what?

21:59.814 --> 22:02.374
I thought I heard someone. I was wrong.

22:06.054 --> 22:07.812
What happened? Nothing.

22:07.814 --> 22:12.174
- I thought I heard a noise, I told you.
- The child, I mean.

22:13.894 --> 22:15.814
- I lost it.
- How?

22:17.294 --> 22:18.715
I just lost it.

22:20.046 --> 22:21.216
You're lying.

22:21.795 --> 22:24.174
You never wanted it in the first place.

22:25.654 --> 22:27.814
He helped you get rid of it, didn't he?

22:28.734 --> 22:30.894
Didn't he? What's it to you?

22:31.354 --> 22:34.074
That child's fate could
have been yours or mine.

22:36.174 --> 22:37.903
Better if it hadn't been.

22:40.854 --> 22:42.734
Our boss wants to see you.

22:43.507 --> 22:44.947
What does Mr Marlott want?

22:45.540 --> 22:47.054
Look, I don't like it but here it is.

22:47.554 --> 22:50.774
He is out to catch someone
and you're his bait.

22:51.184 --> 22:54.372
He is to pick you out from a crowd
at Smithfield like you was fancy.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.972
Whoever comes to take you away, I
am to follow and make an arrest.

22:57.974 --> 23:00.934
- For a tup.
- They don't plan to tup you, Flora.

23:01.433 --> 23:03.433
They plan to kill you.

23:04.127 --> 23:06.887
Wish you'd stayed in that
hospital now, don't you?

23:22.054 --> 23:24.692
- Where are the others?
- Ah, it's just the three of us.

23:24.694 --> 23:28.374
And this. The others are otherwise engaged.

23:30.388 --> 23:31.660
I won't let you do it, sir.

23:31.894 --> 23:34.052
I mean, just us against
God knows who.

23:34.054 --> 23:37.292
Look at her. She can barely stand.

23:37.294 --> 23:38.974
Why not ask her?

23:41.174 --> 23:42.772
Who is it I'm baiting?

23:42.774 --> 23:44.786
Billy.

23:44.974 --> 23:47.252
And whoever he is passing children on to.

23:47.254 --> 23:50.332
Just yesterday she was with child herself.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.014
Now I ain't.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.214
I'm ready.

24:13.256 --> 24:14.776
They ain't coming.

24:16.016 --> 24:18.856
Maybe not in person. But they'll
show their hand somehow.

24:36.656 --> 24:39.536
You can sit here as long as
you like but I am going home.

24:41.456 --> 24:43.697
You stay where you are.

24:51.336 --> 24:52.976
What takes your fancy, sir?

24:53.562 --> 24:54.576
Not you.

24:55.611 --> 24:56.949
What about you, sir?

24:57.699 --> 24:59.777
Girl under 16 maybe?

25:02.696 --> 25:03.856
Who sent you?

25:05.456 --> 25:07.696
Someone who said you would
pay a pretty penny.

25:18.576 --> 25:19.976
Let's find you an angel, then.

25:47.849 --> 25:49.259
I'll have her.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.291
My friend wants to take us to a party.

25:55.382 --> 25:56.436
Where are we going?

25:56.438 --> 25:59.098
Oxford Arms. Room under
the name of Shepherd.

26:00.816 --> 26:01.903
Meet you there.

26:01.905 --> 26:03.858
Let's get you ready, then.

26:58.176 --> 26:59.976
Come on, sir.

28:08.296 --> 28:09.976
Slag!

28:11.336 --> 28:12.616
Slag, they're here!

28:15.456 --> 28:17.176
No tail?

28:40.376 --> 28:41.896
Gentleman paid?

28:44.729 --> 28:46.409
Please. No.

28:49.376 --> 28:51.014
- Well, then.
- No, please!

28:56.496 --> 28:58.254
No, please! Please, no!

28:58.256 --> 29:01.321
No! Please! No!

29:14.576 --> 29:16.216
Shut up!

29:25.336 --> 29:27.854
- The childcatcher.
- Has he got my money?

29:27.856 --> 29:29.816
Get me some rope.

29:32.136 --> 29:33.680
Where have they taken her?

29:35.496 --> 29:37.078
He ain't talking.

29:41.696 --> 29:42.936
Where?

29:43.443 --> 29:45.083
He said, where?

29:49.976 --> 29:51.156
Brick dust.

29:52.872 --> 29:55.256
That's what was on our
hands, red brick dust.

29:57.256 --> 30:00.534
The brick kilns. Nova Scotia Gardens.

30:00.536 --> 30:03.894
If you want to see your money
again, you'll keep guard on him.

30:03.896 --> 30:05.934
Oh, I will.

30:12.536 --> 30:13.896
Don't say a word.

30:16.656 --> 30:17.936
Where is she?

30:19.936 --> 30:22.976
Where is Flora? Tell me
where she is or I'll shoot!

30:28.016 --> 30:29.416
Take him down.

30:33.776 --> 30:35.496
Go on! He ain't got it in him.

30:47.496 --> 30:50.854
Put your weapons down! Or I'll
shoot her where she stands!

30:53.216 --> 30:55.096
Where's the girl?

31:29.216 --> 31:30.736
Ha!

31:40.849 --> 31:42.329
Has she not woke?

31:49.713 --> 31:51.393
You go with her to the hospital.

31:52.513 --> 31:56.193
- I'll search this godforsaken place.
- For what?

31:57.328 --> 32:00.713
Alice and the other children.

32:39.993 --> 32:42.760
A family of murderers that
live in the brick fields.

32:42.762 --> 32:44.311
Call themselves the Bishops.

32:44.313 --> 32:47.111
London is full of murderers.
What makes these special?

32:47.113 --> 32:49.433
They killed to sell to the
surgery schools, sir.

32:49.857 --> 32:52.699
Their method was gas and
fumes from the nearby kiln.

32:52.701 --> 32:54.609
My guess is that they
kept the bodies unmarked

32:54.611 --> 32:56.316
so that they could go for a higher price.

32:56.318 --> 32:59.698
Have you found proof positive
linking them to that thing?

32:59.700 --> 33:01.311
Not yet, sir.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.704
Murder, yes, but not of children.

33:03.706 --> 33:05.871
The Runners are still searching the site.

33:05.873 --> 33:08.336
The Bishops are in cells,
awaiting questioning.

33:08.338 --> 33:11.803
Along with a kidnapper, who I
believe was in league with them.

33:11.805 --> 33:13.111
Tried to kill my last night.

33:13.113 --> 33:14.761
Then why are you here and not there?

33:15.593 --> 33:18.391
I felt I should let you
know immediately, sir.

33:18.393 --> 33:21.871
If word gets out murder was committed
on behalf of the surgery school...

33:21.873 --> 33:26.711
My instruction was to find a
culprit and inform me only.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.159
We now have a potential
scandal on our hands

33:29.161 --> 33:31.782
which will do what that
monstrous object you found

33:31.784 --> 33:34.307
was designed to bring about, create
outrage among the population,

33:34.309 --> 33:36.495
directed towards surgeryschools.

33:36.497 --> 33:39.271
God helps us when Warburton and
the newspapers get hold of this.

33:39.273 --> 33:40.711
You could silence them, sir.

33:40.713 --> 33:42.368
Too late. We might silence the newspapers

33:42.370 --> 33:45.191
but the bally sellers
will accomplish the task for them.

33:45.193 --> 33:47.751
It might yet play to our advantage, sir.

33:47.753 --> 33:51.751
The existence of monsters like this makes
passing the Act even more imperative.

33:51.753 --> 33:55.191
Murder... sanctioned by
the surgery schools!

33:55.713 --> 33:58.433
- Without their knowledge.
- It matters not.

33:59.433 --> 34:04.111
When word of this gets out, Mr Marlott,
heads will most certainly roll.

34:04.802 --> 34:06.680
Yours may very well be one of them.

34:06.682 --> 34:10.534
You asked me to find people with means
and motive to sabotage your act, sir.

34:10.536 --> 34:13.534
- That I have done.
- Your task is not accomplished yet.

34:13.536 --> 34:16.735
I suggest you find the evidence
you need to make your case.

34:20.443 --> 34:21.443
Yes, sir.

34:26.630 --> 34:29.429
How did you know to find me
at Cloth Fair last night?

34:29.431 --> 34:32.190
Who told you I'd be there?
Was it the Bishops?

34:37.232 --> 34:41.469
It's too late for you, Billy. I
know you took Alice. Flora told me.

34:41.472 --> 34:43.750
It makes you the first link in the chain.

34:43.752 --> 34:46.192
Was it for the Bishops or someone else?

34:47.712 --> 34:50.391
Eh? What did you do with her?
Did you kill her? Did they?

34:51.712 --> 34:53.472
Where are her remains, Billy?

34:54.752 --> 34:56.739
Where's the rest of her?

34:59.072 --> 35:00.152
Where is she?

35:04.512 --> 35:09.592

I'll be there watching.

35:35.121 --> 35:36.799
You sell to the surgeons?

35:37.430 --> 35:39.150
To the porters.

35:40.946 --> 35:42.760
Did they know where the bodies came from?

35:43.826 --> 35:47.264
They didn't ask, they
didn't care, but they knew.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.384
You rob graves too?

35:49.386 --> 35:51.944
Sometimes we'd come
across one in the fields.

35:52.514 --> 35:55.104
But they sold for more if in good fettle.

35:55.106 --> 35:57.746
- No marks.
- Is what why the brick ovens?

35:58.895 --> 36:00.573
It's how they wanted them.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.895
And Billy supplied you with the children?

36:04.935 --> 36:06.493
What children?

36:06.950 --> 36:08.296
Who's Billy?

36:08.298 --> 36:09.533
Billy Horse.

36:09.827 --> 36:11.293
The childcatcher.

36:11.751 --> 36:13.216
I don't know no Billy.

36:13.218 --> 36:15.354
There's nothing more to be gained by lying.

36:16.671 --> 36:19.189
You may as well go to your
maker with a clear conscience.

36:19.191 --> 36:20.879
Where are the remains?
Where did you bury them?

36:20.881 --> 36:24.109
I told ya. I don't know no Billy and I
ain't murdered no children.

36:24.111 --> 36:27.271
I birthed babes of me own. 12!

36:29.231 --> 36:31.149
You killed two last night, remember?

36:31.151 --> 36:34.364
But children go for more, don't they?
Why would you scruple at that?

36:34.366 --> 36:37.763
The strays in Smithfield talk of
a monster hunting them at night.

36:37.765 --> 36:39.153
That was Billy! Wasn't he?

36:41.151 --> 36:44.836
I'll say this and then I'll say no more.

36:44.945 --> 36:48.214
Many men have tried to make me take rule.

36:48.216 --> 36:50.831
Those men are cold in their graves.

36:51.935 --> 36:56.244
Our trade was killing. Don't ask
me how many. I couldn't tell you.

36:56.246 --> 36:57.949
Ask them as bought from me.

36:57.951 --> 37:02.669
I won't deny it and I'll swing for it
but I ain't ever took rule from no man

37:02.671 --> 37:05.191
and I never killed no children!

38:51.231 --> 38:52.911
She breathes.

38:54.751 --> 38:55.951
Nothing else.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.843
Hope it was worth it, sir.

39:01.191 --> 39:05.589
Billy says nothing. Mrs Bishop
says she knows nothing of Billy.

39:05.591 --> 39:07.472
And she denies killing children.

39:07.474 --> 39:09.309
- She would.
- Why?

39:09.311 --> 39:12.229
She faces the gallows anyway.
There's no profit in it.

There is another way Billy could have
found me at Smithfield last night.

39:21.271 --> 39:22.269
Flora.

39:23.763 --> 39:24.669
No.

39:24.671 --> 39:26.229
No, sir.

39:26.231 --> 39:28.269
She was never out of our sight.

39:28.271 --> 39:31.589
And besides, she was terrified of him.

39:31.591 --> 39:33.551
I think she knows something.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.949
I want you there when she wakes.

39:36.951 --> 39:38.949
I want you to hear it.

39:38.951 --> 39:39.951
Happily.

39:41.151 --> 39:42.391
If she does.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.871
I'm sorry, George.

39:58.991 --> 40:02.071
Excuse me, sir. Are you Herrick?

40:04.871 --> 40:07.271
The gentleman inside
said you might help me.

40:08.451 --> 40:10.609
Boz. I write for The Chronicle.

40:10.751 --> 40:11.771
What do you want?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.830
Mr Marlott said that you
worked on a case together.

40:15.519 --> 40:17.269
We worked on many.

40:17.271 --> 40:19.309
Frankenstein case?

40:20.317 --> 40:21.595
What's Frankenstein?

40:21.886 --> 40:25.312
Story about a madman who pieces
together the bodies of the dead.

40:28.431 --> 40:31.191
He said I should speak to
you and you'd tell me more.

40:33.951 --> 40:35.671
I've nothing to say.

40:36.558 --> 40:38.878
Don't know what you're talking about.

40:45.631 --> 40:47.351
I can tell you what you need to know.

41:00.571 --> 41:04.861
"The finding of river corpses, or
floaters as they are colloquially known,

41:04.863 --> 41:07.909
"whether of natural or unnatural origin,

41:07.911 --> 41:12.991
"is not an unusual phenomenon in the
working life of Wapping's river police.

41:13.365 --> 41:19.229
"But the discovery last week of a most
singular example of that watery species

41:19.231 --> 41:21.189
"has caused no little consternation.

41:21.191 --> 41:24.151
"Even amongst those stalwarts
of public service.

41:24.851 --> 41:27.129
"For unlike its more ordinary brethren,

41:27.591 --> 41:31.069
"this particular example appears
to have been derived not from one

41:31.071 --> 41:33.229
"but from numerous victims,

41:33.231 --> 41:36.829
"stitched together in an apparent
attempt at surgical reconstruction,

41:36.831 --> 41:41.229
"reminiscent of those notorious,
some would say blasphemous, text,

41:41.231 --> 41:43.109
"Mrs Shelley's Frankenstein,

41:43.111 --> 41:44.951
"or the Modern Prometheus.

41:46.191 --> 41:50.509
"All of which raises the question,
why on the eve of the Anatomy Act,

41:50.511 --> 41:53.109
"has the disclosure of
this monstrous artefact

41:53.111 --> 41:55.151
"been suppressed for over a week.

41:55.997 --> 41:59.669
"What public interest is being
served by denying Londoners

41:59.671 --> 42:02.709
"the knowledge of a diabolical
surgeon in their midst,

42:02.711 --> 42:06.469
"acting in apparent imitation of
Mary Shelley's infamous madman,

42:06.471 --> 42:08.351
"Victor Frankenstein.

42:10.064 --> 42:14.264
"Mr Marlott, formerly of Wapping,
currently of Bow Street,

42:14.418 --> 42:18.259
"may have answers to some
or all of these questions.

42:19.891 --> 42:21.651
"The authoress appears to have fled.

42:23.031 --> 42:24.951
"Whereabouts unknown."

42:27.631 --> 42:29.031
Mrs Hogg.

42:31.431 --> 42:33.551
I have thought of James many times.

42:35.352 --> 42:37.527
You must think very little of me, however.

42:38.992 --> 42:41.830
You helped drive my son to suicide.

42:42.328 --> 42:44.466
Exploited him in your fiction.

42:44.468 --> 42:45.470
Now this.

42:45.472 --> 42:47.872
I only meant to honour James in my book.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.710
I was very young when he died.

42:52.407 --> 42:53.830
We knew not what we were doing.

42:53.832 --> 42:56.100
William Chester knew, though.

42:56.832 --> 42:58.310
And he was no stripling.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.190
Yes, indeed.

43:00.192 --> 43:03.075
And I shall tell you what I told him.

43:03.077 --> 43:06.030
I burned everything of
James's when he died.

43:06.810 --> 43:09.313
His papers and diaries. Even his clothes.

43:10.905 --> 43:13.345
His very scent brought me to grief.

43:14.552 --> 43:16.060
The laboratory?

43:16.833 --> 43:18.190
Untouched.

43:18.453 --> 43:19.992
Until yesterday.

43:20.792 --> 43:22.226
Yesterday?

43:22.228 --> 43:24.245
When Sir William came to call.

43:26.592 --> 43:28.432
I don't wish to see inside.

43:29.472 --> 43:31.632
Leave the key with the
front gate when you go.

43:32.592 --> 43:34.912
Of course, thank you.

43:43.272 --> 43:44.232
Forget the dead.

43:45.992 --> 43:47.112
The past.

43:49.512 --> 43:52.632
And yet there are ghosts that
may take revenge for it.

44:20.192 --> 44:22.347
"We are about to take a step
that will alter the course

44:22.349 --> 44:24.159
of natural philosophy for ever."

44:56.952 --> 44:58.725
"To examine the causes of life,

44:58.727 --> 45:00.635
we must first find the cause of death."
