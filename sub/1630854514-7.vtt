<i>Gossip Girl here.</i>
<i>Your one and only source</i>

- Hello.
- AUDREY HOPE: Hey.

00:23.648 --> 00:27.193
- My literal lord and savior.
- Every launch needs fuel, right?

00:27.277 --> 00:29.070
GOSSIP GIRL:<i> On that note,</i>

- KIKI HOPE: Oh, thank you.
- ELEANOR WALDORF-ROSE:
Oh, thank you.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.373
These are beautiful.
I would literally wear

00:40.457 --> 00:43.835
- every single piece here.
- A sign these will get you buzz.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.295
Maybe just ask me
this time around?

00:45.378 --> 00:46.337
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

00:46.421 --> 00:47.464
Won't happen again.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.298
God, I know
I should be terrified,

00:48.381 --> 00:51.050
but for the first time
in my life,

00:51.134 --> 00:52.302
I don't have an ounce of nerves.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.012
Because you've done the work,
and tomorrow

00:54.095 --> 00:55.972
at the spring luncheon,
everyone will know it.

00:56.055 --> 00:59.100
Thank you. Thank you all.
Hey, breakfast on me.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.477
It's the least I can do.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.853
I'd love to,
but Audrey already--

01:01.936 --> 01:04.898
Claimed her for, uh, book club.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.984
Uh, if only you had read
Yanagihara, you know?

01:08.067 --> 01:11.946

01:17.160 --> 01:18.161
You didn't tell her?

01:19.537 --> 01:21.790
The last thing my mom needs to
be thinking about right now

01:21.873 --> 01:24.000
is my father
and his mistress/girlfriend.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.668
They're only in town
for a few days,

01:25.752 --> 01:26.586
and then they're going to Paris,

01:26.669 --> 01:28.713
so when they're gone
and this event is over,

01:28.797 --> 01:30.089
then I'll tell her.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.051
You're still down
to come, right?

01:33.134 --> 01:36.304
I really need a hand to crush
whenever Jessica speaks.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.806
Of course, babe.

Throwback?

02:07.126 --> 02:08.628
Morning, sleepyhead.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.005
I, uh, saw you posted
to Gossip Girl without me.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.883
- Thought we had a deal.
- You need to speak up, sweetie.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.343
I'm outside of a Barry's

02:20.306 --> 02:22.016

02:22.100 --> 02:23.852
We promised to fuck shit up,

02:23.935 --> 02:26.688
so I posted on GG to light
a fire under your ass.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.858
Gossip Girl really works better
when it's just the one voice.

02:29.941 --> 02:35.155
Boring, it needs more drama,
blood, pizzazz.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.532
We're gonna restore her
to her glory days.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.284
But-- but people don't want
the old Gossip Girl.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.577
They're fine
with the new Gossip Girl.

control permanently.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.505
How am I supposed to do that?
I only report drama,

02:52.589 --> 02:55.258
I don't create it.
I am not playing God.

02:55.341 --> 03:01.055
You don't play God, you are God.
Jesus fucking Christ.

He and I are good now.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.936
<i>What you need is a rivalry.</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:08.354
I tried that. It didn't work.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.398
It only brought
Zoya and Julien closer.

Go for the jugular.

- My parents redacted that.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.178
<i>Town & Country</i> did
a whole feature.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.680

What exactly is it

That doesn't ring any bells.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.821
