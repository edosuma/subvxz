WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:03.771
- Tonight, it's part two of the
"Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.508
- I think any mother
would be curious

00:07.541 --> 00:10.111
if their future son-in-law
is bisexual.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.246
- Yeah, this is where I
will get very defensive.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.115
- I don't want to beat
around the bush.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.383
Were you dating
a married man?

00:15.416 --> 00:18.252
- Everybody knows this, though.

00:18.286 --> 00:22.523
- Stassi's little brother
Nikolai is here.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.592
- You are just gonna
be a drunk guy

00:24.625 --> 00:27.461
only thinking about
having sex with girls.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.097
[laughter]

00:29.130 --> 00:30.264
- Boom, there it is.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.100
I knew you were manipulating me.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.568
- If anyone's manipulating
people, it's you two.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.837
- Are you f---ing kidding me?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.340
- I asked you, did it come
out of your bloody mouth?

00:39.373 --> 00:42.210
It was just another check off
the bitchy things you guys do

00:42.243 --> 00:43.277
in life.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.179
- Your boyfriend didn't want

00:45.213 --> 00:47.081
your relationship exposed.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.549
- Because he's married.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.818
- Do not f--- with my
relationship, bitch!

00:50.851 --> 00:51.852
Fall the f--- back!

00:51.885 --> 00:53.854
- I'm speaking.
How dare you?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.456
- Stop. Stop!

00:55.489 --> 00:56.824
Let me ask a question!

00:56.857 --> 01:01.295
Part two of the "Vanderpump
Rules" reunion starts now.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.863
[Dena Deadly's
"Raise Your Glass" playing]

01:02.896 --> 01:06.234
- * Just raise
your glasses high *

01:06.267 --> 01:08.602
* This one's
for you tonight *

01:08.636 --> 01:10.504
- Welcome back
to the "Vanderpump Rules"

01:10.538 --> 01:12.573
season five reunion.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.575
We're here with
Lisa Vanderpump

01:14.608 --> 01:16.310
and the staff of Sur.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.879
So, Jax, I saw on
social media yesterday

01:18.912 --> 01:21.182
that you got some,
um, fresh Botox.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.883
- I did. I went--
I went and saw my good buddy

01:22.916 --> 01:24.385
Dr. John Layke, and I got--

01:24.418 --> 01:25.553
- But why did you
do it yesterday?

01:25.586 --> 01:26.620
It takes three days
to kick in.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.256
- I didn't know
there was rules.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.590
- You didn't know
there were rules?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.325
- No.
- There are Vanderpump rules.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.127
- Vanderpump rules.
- Just ask her.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.895
- But we all know those
rules don't apply to me.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.466
- Lisa, we've seen you fire
Kristen with no hesitation.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.134
- I've had enough
of your bullsh--.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.902
As far as I'm concerned,
you're not here.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.304
You're not here socially,

01:43.337 --> 01:44.672
and you're fired
from Sur restaurant.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.507
And it's done.
I'm sorry.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.609
That's it.
It's done.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.678
- Why did you have
such mixed emotions

01:50.711 --> 01:52.646
about firing James?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.615
- Because I knew what was
going on in his life.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.417
I knew that he was
struggling emotionally,

01:56.450 --> 01:59.320
and I just didn't want to add
to his personal burden.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.888
When I fired Kristen,
I did her a favor.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.456
- I was an emotional...
- She was being disrespectful.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.457
- Like, car accident!

02:03.491 --> 02:04.625
- Get the f---
out of my business.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.759
She was looking for it.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.729
- Lala, you were working
the night James lost his job.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.631
Do you think other
people contributed

02:10.664 --> 02:12.533
to his getting fired?

02:12.566 --> 02:15.169
- Yeah, his name's Jack Daniels.

02:15.203 --> 02:18.639
- I think it was definitely
because he had been drinking.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.242
- He wasn't in control
of what he was doing,

02:21.275 --> 02:22.743
and when I actually
saw the footage,

02:22.776 --> 02:24.945
I saw how he was
more provocative.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.146
- Me?
- So--yes, you.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.916
- Jax, you seem thrilled that
James was in the hot seat.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.384
- I'm not thrilled,
but you know what?

02:30.418 --> 02:31.585
I'm a little mad about
getting people fired.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.654
You can't get somebody fired.
I mean, we're adults here.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.389
- Yeah, yeah, but you
can be an instigator.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.724
- Were you trying to rile him up
to get him fired?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.259
- Of course.
Everybody--yeah, it's fun.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.693
It's like a wind-up doll,
you know?

02:39.727 --> 02:41.562
You just give him some alcohol
and watch him go.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.696
- So this--
- I'm gonna come at you

02:42.730 --> 02:43.697
whenever I feel like
coming at you.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.532
- Why?

02:44.565 --> 02:45.599
- Kicked out of
everywhere you go.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.535
You can't go a day without
getting your ass kicked.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.936
- 'Cause I'm a rock star,
and you're a bartender.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.704
You need to get
more cosmopolitans!

02:50.738 --> 02:52.273
[dramatic music]

02:52.306 --> 02:53.674
Pop-tini!

02:53.707 --> 02:55.676
- Why do you let him
get you so riled up?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.578
- Some people can just
hit those buttons,

02:57.611 --> 02:58.746
and I've got triggers, man.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.781
I've got triggers.
It's like tik-tik-tik...

03:00.814 --> 03:02.316
Jax knows my triggers.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.684
He knows me.
He knows what to say.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.618
He knows what to do.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.654
And then the way Jax
is just so cocky, like,

03:06.687 --> 03:08.422
"Oh, yeah, thanks for
telling me this info.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.523
I'ma get him later."

03:09.557 --> 03:10.791
- You're pretty cocky
yourself, too.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.693
- Watching that back, I'm like,
"Oh, my God."

03:12.726 --> 03:14.295
Do you see what I mean?
Like, it's--it looked--

03:14.328 --> 03:15.796
it's, like, exactly what
I do on a tennis court.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.699
Two tennis players, you know,
you're playing a game of tennis,

03:18.732 --> 03:20.301
but you're doing
the same action.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.435
You know what I mean?

03:21.469 --> 03:23.304
- You guys are so alike.
- Tom says this all the time.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.539
He's like, "You two
are exactly the same."

03:25.573 --> 03:27.341
We really are.
When I was his age,

03:27.375 --> 03:29.443
I did exactly what he's doing,
if not worse.

03:29.477 --> 03:32.346
- Lisa, you gave
James the advice

03:32.380 --> 03:34.715
to never touch alcohol.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.450
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

03:36.484 --> 03:40.621
- Because it's like fur grows
on the inside of his palms.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.991
And I think unless--
he's young enough to, I think,

03:44.024 --> 03:45.693
maybe get a handle on it.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.329
But I think he really needs
to take it seriously.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.398
- Is the door open again?

03:51.532 --> 03:53.601
- I can't say it's closed.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.035
And I've watched him closely.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.571
And I've seen how
he's progressing.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.474
And I needed to do that,
because I needed him to grow up.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.743
And I knew he wouldn't grow up
if I was enabling him

04:02.776 --> 04:03.577
doing what he was doing.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.479
- I think you should
bring him back.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.681
- You be quiet.
- No, he's f---in' hilarious.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.750
- I want you to spin
at my birthday party.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.619
- Oh, cool.
- Oh, yeah, James.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.753
- That'd be an honor.
I'd love to.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.755
- You might regret this remark.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.524
When's your birthday party?

04:16.557 --> 04:17.791
- Lisa, Lisa, I'm trying
to book a gig.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.661
- Okay, okay, okay.
[laughter]

04:20.694 --> 04:21.795
- Okay, I want to move on.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.996
Let's talk about Montauk.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.700
It was funny to me that, Katie,
the group needed to Google

04:26.734 --> 04:29.337
what a clambake was,

04:29.370 --> 04:33.641
um, to figure out that it's, uh,
an event where you bake clams.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.576
- "An outdoor social gathering

04:35.609 --> 04:38.078
"at which clams
and other seafood

04:38.111 --> 04:39.547
are baked or steamed."

04:39.580 --> 04:41.682
- What if we don't like clams?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.684
- You're gonna pretend--
pretend like you do.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.719
- You Google it in
the Urban Dictionary,

04:45.753 --> 04:48.689
it says, "Smoking weed in a car
with the windows up."

04:48.722 --> 04:49.723
And that's what a clambake is.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.792
And that's what I thought
we were going to do.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.427
[laughter]

04:53.461 --> 04:55.329
- Scheana, why were you so
separate from the girls,

04:55.363 --> 04:56.797
uh, in Montauk?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.532
You couldn't drink what
they were drinking.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.733
You weren't eating shellfish...

04:59.767 --> 05:02.336
- I just--I keep a very
specific diet.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.339
That includes alcohol
and the type of food I eat.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.740
- Well, we're doing
green tea shots.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.709
- One of those,
I will be hungover.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.777
I don't really eat fish.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.978
I'm not jumping in
freezing cold water.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.780
- I don't give a flying f---.
We have robes and towels.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.114
I don't care.
I'm not doing it.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.649
I don't like wine.
I don't like champagne.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.117
I don't like drinking
anything with sugar.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.419
- So you drink a f---ing
club soda...

05:18.452 --> 05:19.587
- Yeah, but then you guys--

05:19.620 --> 05:20.621
- And you don't eat seafood,
just like me.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.655
- Who cares?
[overlapping speech]

05:21.689 --> 05:24.692
- That wasn't--that wasn't
that big of a deal.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.826
- No, but you make it
a big deal.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.561
- Come on.
Come on.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.096
- You make it--
anytime I say anything about,

05:29.129 --> 05:30.598
I don't want to drink
anything with sugar,

05:30.631 --> 05:32.533
or I said, "I like
my flat stomach

05:32.566 --> 05:33.834
that I've worked
very f---ing hard for,"

05:33.867 --> 05:35.569
you guys make me feel
like sh-- for it.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.770
- Scheana, you should say,
"I don't want to take"...

05:36.804 --> 05:38.138
- For f---'s sake.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.373
- "'Cause I would rather
have a flat stomach."

05:39.407 --> 05:41.409
You don't need to say--'cause
then it's like we're like--

05:41.442 --> 05:42.510
- I said that one time.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.511
You told me it was
a dick thing to say,

05:43.544 --> 05:44.578
and I never said it again.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.879
- Why is that
a dick thing to say?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.781
- You guys make me feel
like I have to do a shot,

05:47.815 --> 05:49.149
it's my birthday,
do a shot, do a shot.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.718
[overlapping shouting]
- All right, all right.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.586
We're not--
we're not resolving this.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.689
Um, Ariana, you and Stassi
actually have the same birthday.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.857
- I had it first.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.791
But that just ages me,

05:57.825 --> 05:59.793
so I don't know why I
ever tell anyone that.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.530
- What made you want
to go to Sonoma?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.698
- We really love
northern California.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.666
We love wine country.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.801
And we've also been
to a couple NASCAR races.

06:07.835 --> 06:08.869
- Winery and NASCAR.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.003
- The marriage
of perfect things.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.773
- Jax, you were recovering
from your third boob job.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.675
- It was my second.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.610
- Your doctor told you
not to drink.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.745
- I know.
- Um...

06:17.778 --> 06:19.813
did you take his advice?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.749
- No.
- I started to.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.983
- You know, while he's
on pain medicine,

06:23.016 --> 06:24.752
uh, let's avoid alcohol.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.754
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah!

06:26.787 --> 06:28.822
This is classic, like,
Tom at a music festival.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.858
Always wants to go to the very
f---ing limit.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.760
- We are here.
We have arrived.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.961
- Ha, ha, ha, haaaa!
- We made it.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.162
Put that sh-- away.
- Whoo!

06:35.195 --> 06:36.630
- We are good.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.931
Yeah.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.166
Whoo!

06:39.199 --> 06:40.133
- I didn't drink heavily.

06:40.167 --> 06:44.204
- I have to say, that shower
in the RV was...

06:44.237 --> 06:45.405
- Poor Brittany.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.841
- Brittany, would you have
agreed to stay in a Winnebago

06:47.875 --> 06:48.842
if you knew you were
gonna have to shower

06:48.876 --> 06:51.512
in other people's
back-washed water bottles?

06:51.545 --> 06:52.780
- I'll give you
a bottle of water.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.716
- There's that one and that one.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.451
- Savage life.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.689
- That part might've
changed my mind,

07:01.722 --> 07:02.890
but I love RVs.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.458
That's so fun.
I did that as a kid.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.793
- Brittany's from Kentucky.
- Redneck dream.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.896
- Yeah, it's a redneck dream.
Hello?

07:08.929 --> 07:11.031
I was very pissed and annoyed,
though, I can't lie.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.466
- Schwartz, what was
the nastiest thing

07:12.500 --> 07:13.667
going on in that RV?

07:13.701 --> 07:14.802
- I think it was honestly

07:14.835 --> 07:15.936
whatever was rotting
in the fridge.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.705
You remember that repulsive...
- Yeah.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.807
- Stench? I've never smelled
anything like this in--

07:19.840 --> 07:21.575
- We had to keep
the refrigerator door closed.

07:21.609 --> 07:22.810
- That fridge stinks, dude.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.812
- Dude, it literally
smells so bad.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.814
- Ugh!

07:26.847 --> 07:27.848
- It was like deli meat
went bad.

07:27.881 --> 07:28.949
- It was awful.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.684
- Or chicken or something
went bad.

07:30.718 --> 07:34.822
- Well, I--I mean, I understand
why Lala's up here in BH.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.591
- Right. You know, it seemed
like a nice olive branch

07:37.625 --> 07:38.892
that you invited Lala.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.962
She seemed to accept
the olive branch.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.898
And then you really
ghosted them

07:44.932 --> 07:47.801
the day of the trip.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.670
I mean, you just didn't show.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.705
- Did you guys ever figure out
what happened to Lala?

07:51.739 --> 07:52.906
- "I'm sorry,
I couldn't make it.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.875
"Last minute.
Enjoy the celebration

07:54.908 --> 07:56.777
"with close friends and family.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.579
"I promise I will
make it up to you.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.980
Happy birthday, boo."

08:00.013 --> 08:03.016
- Um, I went into full-on
panic attack mode.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.686
The fact that Jax was going,

08:05.719 --> 08:07.555
and the last thing
he had said to me

08:07.588 --> 08:08.622
was not very kind...

08:08.656 --> 08:09.890
- Nobody wants to be
your friend.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.760
- Have I done something
to make you upset?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.762
- Are you delusional?
- No, I mean, I--

08:14.795 --> 08:16.597
- All winter long, you've been
talking sh-- about everybody.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.065
- Okay, thank you
for the Diet Coke.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.700
If you like to hold grudges
and that's how you want

08:19.733 --> 08:20.834
to spend your time--
- I'm not holding a grudge.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.769
You talk sh-- about people
and then say

08:21.802 --> 08:23.303
"I'm sorry" all of a sudden.
- Okay, bye.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.304
- It doesn't work that way.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.305
- I see. Thank you.
- Grow up!

08:25.338 --> 08:26.874
- Then I see that we're--

08:26.907 --> 08:28.008
- That's bullsh--, though.
- That they're in an RV.

08:28.041 --> 08:28.876
And I'm like, that's--

08:28.909 --> 08:31.779
so they were gonna
throw me in an RV

08:31.812 --> 08:33.747
with these people too?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.849
- We talked ahead of time
before this trip

08:35.883 --> 08:37.084
about these issues.
- Yeah.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.552
- Numerous times.
- Yeah.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.020
- I made it very f---ing clear

08:40.053 --> 08:42.956
that if Jax or anybody
f---ed with you,

08:42.990 --> 08:45.759
I would, like, put a stop to it
immediately.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.796
I feel like you just literally
didn't feel like going.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.731
That's why I feel
like you didn't go.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.899
- You know, Tom, I wish
it was that simple,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.000
that I just didn't
feel like going.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.836
- This excuse, and the excuse
you're giving now...

08:55.869 --> 08:57.037
- Like I said,
it's not an excuse.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.906
My anxiety was through the roof.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.908
- I highly doubt that
is the real reason.

09:00.941 --> 09:01.742
I think that--

09:01.775 --> 09:02.976
- What do you think
is the reason?

09:03.010 --> 09:05.045
- Somebody--did somebody come
and tell them that weekend,

09:05.078 --> 09:07.047
or no?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.716
- No.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.051
- Your guy you were seeing
at that time was in town.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.320
- He lives in LA.
- Well, whatever.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.988
You were with him,
and you guys, what, like...

09:15.022 --> 09:17.124
I don't know, you were at
the Beverly Hills Hotel.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.727
And Tiffany told me, like,
she keep--

09:19.760 --> 09:20.794
she kept telling you to go.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.597
- She seemed pretty happy
to spend a weekend at BH

09:23.631 --> 09:25.933
with massages
and pool time, so...

09:25.966 --> 09:28.769
- She's like, you were like,
really anxious over things,

09:28.802 --> 09:29.937
like, you had to go
have all the fun.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.105
- Honey, you put me in BH,
all anxiety's gonna go away.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.876
- Lala, this season,

09:35.909 --> 09:37.678
you claimed that your
money came from

09:37.711 --> 09:39.379
childhood modeling,
then your mom,

09:39.412 --> 09:41.114
then your movie career.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.084
Then you admitted that your man
pays for your car

09:44.117 --> 09:45.753
but that you're in fact

09:45.786 --> 09:48.822
"sucking dick for a lot more
than Range Rovers."

09:48.856 --> 09:50.658
- I love that line. [giggles]

09:50.691 --> 09:51.859
- So which is it?

09:51.892 --> 09:55.629
- Um, well, I do come from a
family that does have money.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.764
- Okay.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.832
- Um, my mother pays my rent.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.100
I don't pay any of my own bills.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.835
My mom takes care of that too.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.103
- The Range Rover
came from your mom?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.872
- No, I have
the Range Rover now.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.207
- You know, me and Jeremy were
eating breakfast at one time,

10:07.240 --> 10:09.042
and somebody literally
pulled up in your car.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.811
Who was that guy?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.112
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.749
I've never let
anybody take my car.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.184
So are you sure it was mine?
- I was texting you.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.119
Yeah.
- No, I remember this text.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.854
And I said that I didn't--

10:20.888 --> 10:22.723
I--that wasn't me.
And you said it was a guy.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.891
- Well, we went up
and asked the guy

10:23.924 --> 10:26.026
if he knows Lala,
and he's like, "Yeah."

10:26.059 --> 10:28.729
[soft dramatic music]

10:28.762 --> 10:30.964
- I don't know who
would be in my...

10:30.998 --> 10:32.165
in my car.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.067
- I don't want to beat
around the bush.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.436
- Yeah.
- Were you dating a married man?

10:36.469 --> 10:42.109
*

10:42.142 --> 10:44.044
- Everything is,
"I heard. I heard."

10:44.077 --> 10:46.747
Because of everything you've
heard and made up in your head,

10:46.780 --> 10:47.881
you really f--- with my life.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.123
[dramatic music]

10:58.325 --> 10:59.827
*

10:59.860 --> 11:01.294
- I don't want to beat
around the bush.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.164
- Yeah.
- Were you dating a married man?

11:04.197 --> 11:05.165
- No.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.433
- Are you dating a married man?
- And no--no.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.469
And no one is ever going to get
the answer they're looking for.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.171
And I'm sorry I'm not gonna put

11:11.204 --> 11:12.773
my relationship on
the forefront...

11:12.806 --> 11:14.107
- Who are you dating?
- Ever.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.375
And I'm not gonna
say that either.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.110
- Are you dating someone?
- And when it's--

11:17.144 --> 11:17.945
I am.
- You are.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.379
- Yeah.
- Is it the same person that

11:19.412 --> 11:20.280
you were dating last summer

11:20.313 --> 11:24.351
that these ladies
had all heard about?

11:24.384 --> 11:27.687
- Um... I'm not answering
that question.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.792
- But Lala, just by virtue
of the fact that you say

11:31.825 --> 11:34.327
everything's a secret,
that creates intrigue.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.096
Do you understand?
- Right.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.265
- We've all had to bleed out
for this show,

11:38.298 --> 11:40.834
and if you want to come in
and be friends with us

11:40.868 --> 11:43.203
and expect the same respect,

11:43.236 --> 11:45.305
then you need to bleed out too.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.440
- Yeah, but you didn't share
your relationship with the show.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.342
- I--I tried to as much
as I can.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.444
I can't control another person.
I talked about him--

11:51.478 --> 11:53.146
- Are you still with him?
- I wasn't honest--

11:53.180 --> 11:54.347
- Are you guys together
right now?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.349
- No.
- Okay.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.386
- Essentially, Lala was
trying to do this year

11:59.419 --> 12:01.254
what you did season three,
and it doesn't work.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.923
- No, but I didn't--
I didn't try to hide

12:02.956 --> 12:03.757
or lie about him.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.092
- Well, you just wanted
to keep it--

12:05.125 --> 12:06.026
- I never lied.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.360
- You just wanted
to keep it out, right?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.262
- I didn't want to!
I begged Patrick!

12:09.296 --> 12:11.498
- I know you didn't.
He--it was his choice.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.367
- Yes. I'm just trying
to say that we've all

12:14.401 --> 12:16.203
put our lives out there,

12:16.236 --> 12:17.370
and you don't get to come in

12:17.404 --> 12:19.306
and just lie about everything.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.876
- I also don't have the right to
speak about someone else's life

12:22.910 --> 12:24.377
on national television

12:24.411 --> 12:25.879
when they did not
sign up for this,

12:25.913 --> 12:27.247
and I'm leaving it
at that, okay?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.816
- I know how hard it is
to have somebody

12:28.849 --> 12:30.117
that doesn't want to do it.
- No, you don't.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.118
You know nothing
about my situation.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.019
- Yes, she does.
- Yes, I do.

12:32.052 --> 12:32.986
- You know nothing
about my situation.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.155
- She does.
- No, but she was with someone

12:35.188 --> 12:36.289
who wouldn't go on the show.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.191
- It's--that part is so simple.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.861
The rest of it, which none
of you will ever know

12:40.894 --> 12:42.295
because it's nobody's business--

12:42.329 --> 12:44.464
- Because he's married?
- No, Stassi, enough with the--

12:44.497 --> 12:46.834
enough, okay?
- Everybody knows this, though.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.435
- Enough! It's done!

12:48.468 --> 12:51.271
- It's not even a secret.
- Stop being a bully!

12:51.304 --> 12:52.205
- Like, everybody--
I'm not being a bully.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.341
- Leave it alone!
It is not your business!

12:54.374 --> 12:56.443
Knock it off!
Stop being a mean girl!

12:56.476 --> 12:57.811
- I'm not a mean girl.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.446
- Do not f--- with
my relationship, bitch.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.814
- Your attitude...
- Fall the f--- back.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.149
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Lala, Lala, Lala.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.383
- Fall the f--- back.
- Hold on one second.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.317
Hold on one second.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.886
Let's chill for a second.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.155
Lala, the thing is,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.957
is that I would love to, like,

13:09.990 --> 13:12.392
not have any of my personal life
on this show.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.261
- Yes.
- Like, how f---ing convenient

13:14.294 --> 13:17.430
would it be for Tom and Katie to
not show any of their arguments

13:17.464 --> 13:18.498
and all the--
- They both signed up for it.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.267
- I understand.
So did you, though.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.434
- So did you.
- But my man didn't.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.602
- He didn't.
- Yeah, but guess what.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.437
It's not fair.
It's not fair.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.605
- Well, that's why I walked off,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.207
so you don't need
to worry about it.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.942
- Well, I know,
but you're still here.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.410
I'm still looking at you.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.945
- I know.
You're very lucky.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.413
You can thank me later.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.416
[laughter]

13:36.449 --> 13:39.619
- Kristen, after hearing about
Lala's sketchy behavior,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.889
you resolved to take her down.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.524
Why did you think James
would be the key to this?

13:44.557 --> 13:47.494
- He's the only person that we
knew that was friends with her,

13:47.527 --> 13:49.362
and I think he's
easy to manipulate.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.230
- What does that really mean?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.531
It really depends
on where someone--

13:51.564 --> 13:52.966
- That you're easy
to manipulate.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.634
- I'm speaking.
How dare you?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.003
- [laughing]

13:56.036 --> 13:58.405
- Boy, Jax, he is
cracking you up today.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.639
- I can't stop.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.342
I don't know if this
is a show or--or what,

14:02.375 --> 14:03.343
but this is hilarious.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.912
- So the girls baited you...

14:04.945 --> 14:06.346
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- To get in together...

14:06.379 --> 14:09.382
- Bitchy move.
- To snitch on your friend?

14:09.416 --> 14:10.383
- Yeah.
- Why did you agree

14:10.417 --> 14:11.484
to meet with them?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.385
- 'Cause they had
something to say.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.620
Quite frankly, I was
kind of intrigued.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.989
They sucked me in; they said
she was talking crap about me

14:16.023 --> 14:16.990
when they didn't.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.425
- I know for a fact

14:18.458 --> 14:20.961
that she just does nothing
but talk sh-- about you.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.329
She said she does not like you.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.931
You guys are not friends.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.366
You f--- girls behind
your girlfriend's back.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.335
- Like, no one's ever
told me that before.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.503
- Wait, hold up.
We did really hear that.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.505
- Yeah, we didn't lie.
- You sucked me in and I--

14:32.539 --> 14:34.241
- No, but we--we really
did hear that.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.976
- No, I didn't make that up.
- Yeah, you did.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.644
- This is what we were told.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.313
- No! I asked you, did it come
out of your bloody mouth?

14:40.347 --> 14:43.350
It was just another check off
the bitchy things you guys do

14:43.383 --> 14:45.385
in life, another check
off your list, all right?

14:45.418 --> 14:48.355
- James, when did Lala give you
an NDA to sign?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.522
- I have no idea.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.059
- Anyone who's with me
where I decide

14:52.092 --> 14:53.560
to get obliterated, smoke weed--

14:53.593 --> 14:54.694
there are things that I said...

14:54.727 --> 14:56.363
- I need an NDA.
- Yeah, you do.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.230
- In front...
- I do.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.699
- Of friends.
I was in a hotel room.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.668
My friend invited one
of her friends over.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.337
She Snapchatted me while I was
high and drunk in the bathtub,

15:04.371 --> 15:05.538
butt naked.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.540
Ever since then,
it's been a known thing--

15:07.574 --> 15:10.277
- But you Snapchat yourself.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.313
- You have your friends
sign NDAs?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.348
- You posted an Instagram
photo naked.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.484
- But if you're talking about it
right now, what's the NDA do?

15:17.517 --> 15:19.352
Or MBA. I don't even know
what the hell that is.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.021
[laughter]
- An NDA. It--

15:21.054 --> 15:23.423
- It's a non-disclosure
agreement, which means you can't

15:23.456 --> 15:26.426
disclose whatever the person
that you're signing it for

15:26.459 --> 15:28.461
doesn't want you to disclose.
- Okay.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.462
- What's the problem
with the NDA?

15:29.496 --> 15:31.331
What's the issue?
- Yeah, what is the issue?

15:31.364 --> 15:32.299
- So you signed it?
- No!

15:32.332 --> 15:35.368
- Lala, it sounds odd
to give people NDAs.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.037
- Oh, absolutely not.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.339
- Jesus Christ.
- Absolutely not?

15:39.372 --> 15:40.573
- I'm shocked that
no one else does.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.343
There are so many things that
come out of people's mouths

15:43.376 --> 15:44.644
when I'm with my
f---ing friends

15:44.677 --> 15:46.313
that I want to know
what you're posting.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.547
- But if they're your
f---ing friends,

15:47.580 --> 15:49.349
shouldn't they be...
- Yeah, exactly.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.583
- Have your back.
- Have your back?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.452
- Some people are
gonna Snapchat,

15:52.485 --> 15:53.553
and they're not going
to even think about--

15:53.586 --> 15:55.388
- But she's saying, why are
you letting those people

15:55.422 --> 15:57.724
in the bathtub when
you're lying--

15:57.757 --> 15:58.791
- And that's why we've
stopped doing it.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.994
- Lala, you could solve
this problem a lot easier

16:01.028 --> 16:03.396
by just not being around people
that you don't trust.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.733
- Stassi, you seem certain
that Tom and Ariana did sign.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.069
- So we all heard that there
was an NDA at Coachella.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.703
Like, a contract.
Okay, whatever.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.639
You can't talk about
her boyfriend.

16:12.672 --> 16:13.740
That's what we all heard.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.475
- I didn't sign an NDA, for...

16:15.508 --> 16:18.345
- Yes, you did!

16:18.378 --> 16:22.049
- You know if anybody handed me
a f---ing NDA,

16:22.082 --> 16:24.517
I would literally tell them to
shove it up their f---ing ass.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.752
- Like, I'm not saying
you signed it.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.020
I'm not saying that.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.788
- But you said I was
lying about it

16:28.821 --> 16:30.423
when you brought it up at--

16:30.457 --> 16:32.392
- Yes, I'm saying it looks
like you could be lying.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.461
Of course. Well, Jen
had told me that--

16:34.494 --> 16:35.462
- Everything is
"I heard, I heard"!

16:35.495 --> 16:37.164
- Let me ask you this.
- Because of everything

16:37.197 --> 16:38.498
you've heard and made up
in your head,

16:38.531 --> 16:39.666
you've really f---ed
with my life a lot.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.401
- Let me ask you this.
- So stop.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.769
- Let me ask you this.
- You're a grown-ass woman.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.771
- Stop with the--
- Okay, stop, stop!

16:44.804 --> 16:46.106
Stop.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.107
- I'm not playing
the victim at all.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.641
- Stop!
Let me ask a question!

16:48.675 --> 16:49.642
- Shhhh.
- You're doing a lot of things

16:49.676 --> 16:50.677
that I don't like.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.445
- Lala...

16:52.479 --> 16:54.747
is the true reason you
were handing out NDAs

16:54.781 --> 16:58.451
because your boyfriend
didn't want

16:58.485 --> 17:01.488
your relationship
with him exposed?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.091
It seems like if you're
handing out NDAs,

17:04.124 --> 17:05.792
that would--
there would be a link.

17:05.825 --> 17:10.397
- I have NDAs to protect
my life off of this show.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.165
Okay?
- Okay.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.800
- I'm no longer
a part of this show.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.402
So I think it's been me--
- But with all due--

17:15.435 --> 17:16.369
and I don't mean this
as an insult,

17:16.403 --> 17:19.439
but who are you that
everyone is trying to...

17:19.472 --> 17:20.773
print this material about you

17:20.807 --> 17:22.542
that you need to be
handing out NDAs?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.111
- Is this coming from
your boyfriend?

17:24.144 --> 17:25.678
- No. Leave him out of this.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.679
He has nothing to do with it.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.548
Stop even talking about him.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.549
God damn.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.151
- I've never heard of that.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.486
- It's not like you're
Caitlyn Jenner or something.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.822
- So, Lala, after withdrawing
from your friends,

17:35.855 --> 17:38.491
you decided to withdraw
from Lisa and Sur

17:38.525 --> 17:40.227
and everything else--why?

17:40.260 --> 17:43.630
- Because I was just becoming
an unhealthy individual.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.732
I was hammered all day,
every day.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.568
I was just not in
a good headspace.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.237
You know, human beings
can only take so much

17:50.270 --> 17:51.571
until it's like, "You know what?
F--- this.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.839
I--I can't do it anymore."

17:52.872 --> 17:54.707
- Why did you
encourage her to stay?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.243
- Because I think you should
have the courage

17:56.276 --> 17:57.777
of her convictions.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.712
And I think she's stronger
than she knows she is.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.814
And she's so used to running
back to Mommy,

18:01.848 --> 18:03.883
that's not a way to grow up.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.752
- Lala, you're not
working at Sur.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.188
Is this really
goodbye to this group?

18:08.221 --> 18:09.156
- Nah.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.791
- It's really weird
being here right now.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.694
First and foremost, I have done
a lot of slamming

18:14.727 --> 18:16.463
to every single person up here,

18:16.496 --> 18:20.233
so I just want to let y'all know
that for that--I'm sorry for.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.702
- Thank you.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.537
- I have to give you a moment,
you know.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.239
It's really hard to come
into this group

18:26.273 --> 18:28.208
and try to find
where you fit in.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.243
I will say one place
where you've been wrong.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.678
I think in the very beginning,

18:31.711 --> 18:33.246
you came in with the hard sell
with yourself.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.182
"I'm crazy; you don't
want to mess with me."

18:35.215 --> 18:37.284
You just oversold yourself
in the beginning a little bit.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.619
I wish I would've just gotten
to know this person more,

18:39.652 --> 18:41.254
'cause you seem awesome.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.223
- No, I definitely came
into this situation

18:43.256 --> 18:44.891
because I had heard
so many things

18:44.924 --> 18:46.759
that were being said about me
before I started.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.263
So when you walk in somewhere
with your dukes already up,

18:50.297 --> 18:52.932
it's like, oh, this is gonna
go bad very quickly.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.268
- Well, good luck with
whatever's next.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.536
- Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.704
- And hopefully we'll
see you around.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.705
- Yes, definitely.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.906
- We'll be back after this.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.912
- I think that you shouldn't
call girls the B-word.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.314
- I'm working on it, yeah.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.249
- Yeah, well, work harder.

19:15.455 --> 19:15.888
[upbeat music]

19:18.325 --> 19:20.360
- We are back with
the "Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.494
I'm Andy Cohen.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.664
I want to talk about the
unfairly hot couple to my right,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.766
Tom and Ariana.
- Thank you.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.968
- Um, I think we saw
the two of you

19:29.001 --> 19:30.737
get in the biggest fight ever

19:30.770 --> 19:32.672
over Ariana's cocktail book.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.973
- I think it actually was.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.576
- Tom tried to, um,
sidle in on it.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.411
- Everybody came up to me
and they're like,

19:38.445 --> 19:40.680
"Why is Ariana doing
a cocktail book and not you?"

19:40.713 --> 19:42.215
- Really?
- Yes!

19:42.249 --> 19:43.550
- You're not gonna be the face,

19:43.583 --> 19:45.518
and you're not gonna take
attention away from me.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.686
[tense music]

19:46.719 --> 19:48.488
Don't f---ing roll your eyes,

19:48.521 --> 19:49.722
you little f---ing bitch.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.624
*

19:51.658 --> 19:53.693
- Why did that irritate you
so much?

19:53.726 --> 19:56.563
- It irritated me because
I had for months, like,

19:56.596 --> 19:58.731
already been working
with someone on it,

19:58.765 --> 20:01.301
and I had already done
this huge proposal,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.270
got it represented by an agency.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.639
I just felt like, well, you
can't just, like, jump in now.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.808
- But I will say, I kept
giving you ideas.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.577
I came up with your
mission statement--

20:10.610 --> 20:11.711
- You were very persistent.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.547
- At the end of the day, we are
doing the book together.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.716
- Oh, you are?
- Yeah.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.418
- That's like them
getting married.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.587
Or not.
[laughter]

20:20.620 --> 20:23.490
- It's been kind of sad
to see you

20:23.523 --> 20:27.560
brush off Sandoval's
persistent hints at marriage.

20:27.594 --> 20:32.265
You're clearly absolutely
crazy about each other.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.267
Why not make him happy by
letting him give you

20:34.301 --> 20:35.602
a big, fat ring?

20:35.635 --> 20:39.372
- Um, I guess I just
don't see the point.

20:39.406 --> 20:43.643
And I feel like every time
someone asks me about it,

20:43.676 --> 20:45.412
I get more and more frustrated,

20:45.445 --> 20:46.846
because I feel like
it's my life...

20:46.879 --> 20:48.815
- I actually do too.
- And I will do what I want.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.483
- The thing about it is,

20:50.517 --> 20:52.819
I've never really been
with somebody where I--

20:52.852 --> 20:54.721
like, that thought
came into my mind.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.423
I never--I was like,
"I'm never getting married.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.290
I'm never getting married."

20:57.324 --> 20:58.658
- You never thought that
about Kristen?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.793
- No, sorry.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.495
- Did you guys ever
talk about it?

21:02.529 --> 21:04.397
- Uh, I think so.
- You were together a long time.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.365
- Yes, you did?
- Y'all did?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.467
- A little bit.
- Like, in the first couple

21:07.500 --> 21:09.669
of years when you're like,
I'll, like, this is so--

21:09.702 --> 21:10.737
you know what I mean.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.639
- Conversely, uh, Brittany,

21:12.672 --> 21:14.874
you are a major
marriage proponent.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.076
You've been planning
your wedding since

21:17.109 --> 21:18.144
you were a little girl.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.647
- Yep, I know exactly what
I want it to look like.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.481
[laughter]

21:21.514 --> 21:23.783
- We're gonna go to Denny's.
- No.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.685
- What's--what's your reaction

21:25.718 --> 21:27.820
to their point of view?

21:27.854 --> 21:30.357
- Just me personally, I know
I want to have kids.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.691
I know I want to have a family.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.725
I want to have that foundation.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.727
And that's just something
I've always wanted.

21:34.761 --> 21:35.862
- Stassi--
- So it's different.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.631
- Stassi, do you want
to get married,

21:38.665 --> 21:41.100
or do you understand
Ariana's hesitation?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.470
- If you would've asked me this
six years ago,

21:43.503 --> 21:46.539
like, when Katie and I were
Pinterest-ing wedding sh-- 24/7,

21:46.573 --> 21:48.775
I would've had a completely
different answer.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.579
But I come from a family where
they, like, marry for sport.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.648
They divorce for sport.
And, like, I just--

21:55.682 --> 21:56.749
- How many times has
your dad been married?

21:56.783 --> 22:00.720
- They've both been married
three times going on--

22:00.753 --> 22:03.490
my dad just proposed
to his fourth.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.691
[laughter]

22:04.724 --> 22:05.892
- If you're not at least
slightly wary

22:05.925 --> 22:07.660
of the institution of marriage,

22:07.694 --> 22:09.762
I don't think you're doing
enough critical thinking.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.698
Like, I'm so happily married,
but like,

22:11.731 --> 22:13.466
you should be a little
wary of it, right?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.801
- No, I hope that that--
I hope that that--

22:14.834 --> 22:15.802
that it works out.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.937
That would be really nice.
But I don't know.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.640
- Okay, I want to talk about
Kristen's comedy show.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.742
Jax, at what point
did you realize

22:22.775 --> 22:26.413
that Kristen was standing
in front of that audience

22:26.446 --> 22:28.781
holding a picture of your dick?

22:28.815 --> 22:30.483
- About 15 seconds.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.484
- That's a long time.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.585
[laughter]

22:32.619 --> 22:33.753
- Happy birthday, Kristen.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.722
- For me? Shut up.
Where did you get this?

22:35.755 --> 22:37.657
- My boyfriend.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.758
- Oh, my God, you're so bad.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.794
[cheers and applause]

22:41.828 --> 22:43.530
- Oh, my God.
It better not be.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.732
My poor girlfriend, who's just
brand new to the group,

22:45.765 --> 22:47.867
who is just kind of coming
into this group--

22:47.900 --> 22:49.402
- Jax, you didn't care that
it hurt her feelings.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.870
You cared that she got mad.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.505
I cared that it hurt
her feelings.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.506
- If you cared that it
hurt her feelings,

22:53.540 --> 22:54.641
then you wouldn't have done it.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.875
- Yeah, she promised me
it's never gonna happen again,

22:55.908 --> 22:58.845
and if I ever see it again,
I'm probably gonna smack her.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.647
- Poor Brittany, she's in
a f---ing group

23:00.680 --> 23:02.148
with a bunch of lunatics.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.751
- I love everybody, and that's
what's so hard about this.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.487
- Lisa, tacky even by
Kristen's standards?

23:07.520 --> 23:08.988
- Yeah, really tacky.
Really thoughtless.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.657
Really hurtful.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.992
- That was not the show
that Brittany's mom was at.

23:13.025 --> 23:13.960
- No.
- No.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.662
- Okay. I just want to make sure

23:15.695 --> 23:18.731
that your mom has now not
seen a picture of Jax's--

23:18.765 --> 23:21.968
- No, but, I mean, she knows now
that that happened, too.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.671
- Right.
Well, speaking of your mom...

23:24.704 --> 23:27.206
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, we got to meet Sherri

23:27.239 --> 23:29.642
when she came in from Kentucky.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.511
- Mm-hmm.
- Why would you bring your mom

23:31.544 --> 23:33.646
to a roast of Jax?

23:33.680 --> 23:35.782
- I knew things were
gonna go bad,

23:35.815 --> 23:37.850
but she had just gotten there,
and I--

23:37.884 --> 23:38.885
- I didn't want her
to stay home.

23:38.918 --> 23:39.819
- I didn't want to leave my mom.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.821
I mean, I miss my mom
more than anybody.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.190
- Lisa, are you surprised
that Brittany's mom made it

23:44.223 --> 23:45.658
through the entire roast?

23:45.692 --> 23:46.793
- Yeah, absolutely.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.661
I mean, I was horrified.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.230
- You had met Brittany's mom
at the shower.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.899
- Mm-hmm.
- And you had asked her

23:52.932 --> 23:55.968
if she was sure she wanted
Jax to marry Brittany.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.504
- I like him.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.539
- Enough, though, to marry him?

23:59.572 --> 24:02.475
I want to wish you luck
with that.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.544
- She's so wholesome.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.046
And he's the complete opposite.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.549
I just thought that
if she was my daughter,

24:09.582 --> 24:12.785
I--I probably wouldn't
be that happy about it.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.954
- I mean, I don't want
to sound flip, but you've lied,

24:14.987 --> 24:16.856
cheated, and stolen.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.260
Were you surprised that
Brittany's mom seemed most upset

24:21.293 --> 24:23.262
that you've kissed a guy?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.832
- I kissed a guy about as much
as these two kiss every day.

24:25.865 --> 24:26.899
[laughter]

24:26.933 --> 24:28.267
[screaming]

24:28.300 --> 24:30.269
- Ew, ew!

24:30.302 --> 24:32.872
- Oh!
- Yeah!

24:32.905 --> 24:35.241
- Does that mean that you guys
have to do it another time?

24:35.274 --> 24:36.609
- No, no!
No more!

24:36.643 --> 24:37.677
No, I'm over it.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.845
- See? I mean, it's like--

24:38.878 --> 24:40.513
it's a joke,
and it's funny and all,

24:40.547 --> 24:41.648
but you guys are making it,
like, out to be,

24:41.681 --> 24:43.750
like, this thing, when you guys
do it every damn day.

24:43.783 --> 24:44.584
- Okay, but back
to the question--

24:44.617 --> 24:45.985
- Whatever. Okay
- Were you surprised

24:46.018 --> 24:47.787
that it became an issue?

24:47.820 --> 24:51.591
- Yeah, if I was in her shoes,
I probably would've went after

24:51.624 --> 24:52.992
the cheating and the drugs
and all that sh--.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.828
- What made you storm out,
though, of the apartment?

24:55.862 --> 24:56.996
- I just kind of thought--

24:57.029 --> 24:58.631
felt I was being
a little bit cornered.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.600
- Something about you
being a homosexual...

25:00.633 --> 25:01.601
- It didn't happen.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.536
You either take my word for it,
or you don't.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.737
- There's no need
to have attitude.

25:04.771 --> 25:05.738
- I'm gonna go.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.874
[dramatic music]

25:07.907 --> 25:10.009
I probably should've just
kind of went into my room

25:10.042 --> 25:11.611
for a minute and then
came back out.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.879
'Cause I do--
I have a short fuse.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.547
Everybody knows that.
I don't, you know--

25:14.581 --> 25:15.882
I shoot first, ask later.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.850
- I thought it was
inappropriate, though,

25:17.884 --> 25:19.886
for her to grill you
on your sexual past.

25:19.919 --> 25:20.953
- It's her daughter.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.288
She's kind of like,
"Okay, listen--"

25:22.321 --> 25:23.756
- Yeah, this is where I
will get very defensive.

25:23.790 --> 25:24.857
- She--okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.759
- Any mother would be curious...
- Yes.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.761
But it's little bit different
of a place, and so...

25:28.795 --> 25:29.929
- Yeah, but would be curious
if their future son-in-law

25:29.962 --> 25:31.598
is bisexual.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.899
And that was the intimation.
- Now I'm bisexual?

25:32.932 --> 25:34.300
- I'm not saying--
- No.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.602
- I think that was the--
- For Christ's sake.

25:35.635 --> 25:36.803
- That--if you were--

25:36.836 --> 25:39.639
- Brittany, your mom took
a lot of heat on social media.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.908
- Mm-hmm.
- For, um, zoning in

25:41.941 --> 25:44.944
on Jax's questionable past.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.914
- Yeah, that's something that
I will defend no matter what.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.582
All of you guys have
met my mom now,

25:49.616 --> 25:52.619
and she is not homophobic
whatsoever.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.721
That was one of the hardest
times that I've had

25:54.754 --> 25:57.624
doing the show, was the people
attacking my mom,

25:57.657 --> 25:59.659
who is the most amazing woman...
- She is.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.360
- I have ever met
in my entire life.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.631
She was talking about what
she heard at the roast.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.966
It was brought up by you,
probably, at the roast.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.367
- No, uh, Schwartz, yeah.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.002
- So she wanted to know...

26:10.036 --> 26:12.104
- I know there's many
rumors floating around

26:12.138 --> 26:15.341
about Jax having
a homosexual affair

26:15.374 --> 26:16.876
as a young model in Miami.

26:16.909 --> 26:17.877
- It's not true.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.045
- "It's only gay
if you like it.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.681
Listen, those bills--they're
not gonna pay themselves."

26:21.714 --> 26:24.884
- I have to say, as a--
as a gay guy watching that,

26:24.917 --> 26:26.886
I understood why she
would be interested in...

26:26.919 --> 26:28.054
- She was just asking.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.822
- A possible son-in-law's
sexuality.

26:29.856 --> 26:30.757
- I understand.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.692
No, that's why I'm
defending her on that.

26:32.725 --> 26:33.960
I'm like, listen,
in her defense,

26:33.993 --> 26:34.927
you have to understand
where she's from.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.363
It's a very different world
where she lives.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.831
Okay? It's almost--

26:38.865 --> 26:39.832
I'm not saying it's
a different country,

26:39.866 --> 26:42.735
but it's extremely conservative.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.805
- Well, Jax, we actually
followed you to Kentucky

26:45.838 --> 26:49.075
as you tried to make it
as a farm boy

26:49.108 --> 26:51.878
and convince Brittany's family
you were good enough

26:51.911 --> 26:53.179
for their daughter.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.881
Okay, good luck with that.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.817
Take a look
at "Vanderpump Rules:

26:57.850 --> 27:00.720
Jax and Brittany Take Kentucky."

27:00.753 --> 27:02.021
[horse neighs]
- Oh, boy.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.990
Whoa!

27:04.023 --> 27:05.658
Farmer Jax.

27:05.692 --> 27:06.926
[clucking]

27:06.959 --> 27:08.695
- [shrieks]

27:08.728 --> 27:10.162
- You should capture
this moment.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.864
[rock music]

27:11.898 --> 27:13.132
- Oh, my gosh,
look at the grass.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.166
- Wait a minute.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.036
Ugh, what is that?
Deer piss?

27:17.069 --> 27:18.705
- Do you think he's the one?

27:18.738 --> 27:20.973
- Oh, yeah. I can't imagine
not being with him.

27:21.007 --> 27:21.874
- When you gettin' married, son?

27:21.908 --> 27:23.075
- We're heading in
the right direction.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.812
- You've been in the right
direction for almost two years.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.880
- I want to get married.
I want to get married soon.

27:27.914 --> 27:28.948
- I like that plan.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.750
- If you want to make
Brittany happy,

27:30.783 --> 27:32.218
make her happy right there.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.022
- I could see myself getting
bored real easily here.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.791
- [speaking in tongues]

27:40.126 --> 27:41.994
White trash, begone!

27:42.028 --> 27:44.463
- I'm her f---ing
best friend, Jax!

27:44.496 --> 27:46.465
- You're an old man, and you
need to act your age.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.901
- You don't mind taking
money from this old man.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.970
- Your arrogance
is your downfall.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.806
- That guy is trying
to control you.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.908
- You can't even accept
my friends or my family.

27:55.942 --> 27:56.876
- Can I talk? Can I talk?

27:56.909 --> 27:57.844
- You're delusional!

27:57.877 --> 28:00.179
- I didn't want the last day
to be like this.

28:09.421 --> 28:09.856
[dramatic music]

28:12.825 --> 28:16.395
- It's time to add a little
maturity to this group.

28:16.428 --> 28:20.266
Stassi's little brother
Nikolai is here.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.368
Hey, Nikolai.
[scattered applause]

28:22.401 --> 28:24.303
- Hi.
- So good to see you.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.872
- You're so brave.
- Yep.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.340
- You are.
Hey, Nikolai, how old are you?

28:28.374 --> 28:30.442
- I'm 12.
- What grade are you in?

28:30.476 --> 28:31.477
- I'm in sixth grade.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.478
- Excellent.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.846
We first met you

28:33.880 --> 28:36.215
on the show many years ago

28:36.248 --> 28:39.485
when Stassi was dating Jax.
- Yeah.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.321
- What did you think of Stassi
and Jax as a couple?

28:42.354 --> 28:44.824
- I mean, they were good
at first,

28:44.857 --> 28:46.225
but then it just went all wrong.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.426
- What I'm doing
is not working.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.361
Maybe you can help.
- Here's the deal.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.363
You always cannot
be shy of girls.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.765
She's just a human,

28:52.799 --> 28:54.266
not like a wolf or snake.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.268
- Well, Stassi can be
like a wolf sometimes.

28:56.302 --> 28:57.136
- She can.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.371
You just have to listen
to that advice.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.173
- I will.
I'm gonna take it to heart.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.541
Smart little man.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.944
I'm a little scared of you.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.379
- I tried.
I tried the best I could,

29:07.413 --> 29:09.281
but he just wouldn't listen.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.349
[laughter]

29:10.382 --> 29:12.251
- Well, Stassi, this season,

29:12.284 --> 29:15.254
we saw you go through
a rough breakup with Patrick.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.923
Um, how long were you together,

29:16.956 --> 29:18.224
and why did you break up?

29:18.257 --> 29:20.259
- Three years we were together.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.261
Honestly, a lot of reasons.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.863
- Did he ever, like,
knock the show

29:23.896 --> 29:25.331
or, like, you being on it,

29:25.364 --> 29:26.866
or, like, discourage you
from being on it?

29:26.899 --> 29:28.334
- In the beginning--
in the beginning,

29:28.367 --> 29:29.268
yeah, all the time.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.903
And then when I moved back--

29:30.937 --> 29:32.271
- Was that the reason--
was that part of the reason

29:32.304 --> 29:33.840
that you left the show?

29:33.873 --> 29:35.274
- I think, yeah.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.542
I don't like admitting that...
- Knew it.

29:36.575 --> 29:37.543
- 'Cause it makes me feel,
like, really weak.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.279
But then he became supportive
of me doing it

29:40.312 --> 29:42.514
and supportive
of everything else.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.283
But it still didn't work out.

29:44.316 --> 29:48.154
- Nikolai, were you sad when
Stassi and Patrick broke up?

29:48.187 --> 29:50.356
- Yeah, 'cause I thought--
I thought it was, like--

29:50.389 --> 29:51.290
I thought it was good.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.859
I thought she was
gonna stick with him,

29:52.892 --> 29:54.226
but I just guess not.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.162
Not to be mean, Stassi,
just so you know,

29:56.195 --> 29:59.398
I feel like she made Patrick

29:59.431 --> 30:02.534
to only think about her
to get--make--

30:02.568 --> 30:03.903
get everything she wants.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.304
And Stassi, just so you know,

30:05.337 --> 30:07.940
you can't get everything
you want in life.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.909
I've seen you do that,
numerous times.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.477
- Okay, shut up.
- And maybe this is why

30:11.510 --> 30:13.345
you broke up with
three boyfriends.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.346
[laughter]
- Oh, my God.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.548
- Nikolai, I think in this
situation, though,

30:16.582 --> 30:19.418
she just clearly said that
he pressured her a lot

30:19.451 --> 30:20.519
about the show in the beginning.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.454
If he did, that's really
f---ed up.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.891
- Watch your language
in front of the child.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.859
- Sorry.
- Stassi, your little brother

30:26.893 --> 30:29.395
had very wise words
when you two broke up.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.596
- I know. I just don't
take him seriously

30:30.629 --> 30:32.464
until I see it on TV.
[laughing]

30:32.498 --> 30:34.233
- Is that true?

30:34.266 --> 30:36.435
- Like, we have these
conversations all the time,

30:36.468 --> 30:38.504
but I'm like,
"What do you know?"

30:38.537 --> 30:40.907
I need you to just,
like, be supportive,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.409
'cause I feel like
I'm losing it.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.944
- Come here.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.412
Life's tough, man.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.014
Especially in your 20s.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.215
- [sobbing]

30:49.248 --> 30:51.450
- You do seem very...

30:51.483 --> 30:53.352
wise beyond your years.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.553
Where do you think
that comes from?

30:54.586 --> 30:55.554
- I just--I--

30:55.587 --> 30:56.455
it just comes in my head.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.291
I just--I learn it,
and then I just--

30:59.325 --> 31:00.927
- "Sex and the City."

31:00.960 --> 31:02.228
- He loves "Sex and the City."

31:02.261 --> 31:03.395
- You love "Sex and the City"?

31:03.429 --> 31:04.964
- Hey, I used to, though.
I used to.

31:04.997 --> 31:05.965
- You used to.
- Wow.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.233
- Isn't that...
- Yeah.

31:07.266 --> 31:10.469
- Wow. What's the weirdest thing
you can tell us about Stassi?

31:10.502 --> 31:12.338
[laughter]
- Oh, yes, please.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.506
- Oh, um...
- Oh, gosh.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.575
- I don't want to mention it.

31:16.608 --> 31:17.643
- No.
- But--

31:17.676 --> 31:18.945
- You're safe here.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.012
- Circle of trust.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.313
- You're in the trust
[inaudible.]

31:21.347 --> 31:22.614
- Don't be mad at me.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.483
[laughter]

31:24.516 --> 31:26.552
I walked in your
door one time...

31:26.585 --> 31:27.653
- Oh, God.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.488
- And...

31:29.521 --> 31:31.557
I saw your... boobies.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.592
[laughter]

31:33.625 --> 31:35.261
And--and then, no.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.395
And then--no.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.396
And then you turn around,

31:37.429 --> 31:39.966
and you made the strangest
face in the world.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.033
- [laughing]

31:41.067 --> 31:42.969
- It was like, ugh!

31:43.002 --> 31:44.336
It was just cringeworthy.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.272
[laughter]

31:46.305 --> 31:48.374
- That is the proper response
for your sister to have.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.377
- Was this before or after
her breast reduction?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.379
- Before.
- Before.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.981
- Oh, it was before, he said.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.016
- But then it was intense.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.085
- Nikolai, what do you
love about your sister?

31:59.118 --> 32:02.554
- Um, I love that she
sticks up for herself,

32:02.588 --> 32:05.091
because some people here don't.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.026
She doesn't take
any crap from anyone.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.995
And yeah, she cares
about other people.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.429
So I like that.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.099
- Nikolai, we love watching
the advice that you give

32:13.132 --> 32:14.633
to Stassi on the show.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.003
Before you leave,
leave everybody

32:17.036 --> 32:18.604
with a piece of advice, okay?

32:18.637 --> 32:22.374
Let's start with, um,
Tom Schwartz, your buddy.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.742
- All right.
- Hey, bud.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.377
- Well...

32:25.411 --> 32:26.512
- You can let me have it.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.980
- Okay.
- Don't hold back.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.648
- Okay, well,
you got to let me talk.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.383
- Oh, sorry.
[laughter]

32:31.417 --> 32:35.721
- Okay, I think that you
shouldn't call girls the B-word.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.457
- I know.
- Just like you called them two.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.725
- I'm working on it, yeah.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.593
- Yeah, well, work harder.

32:41.627 --> 32:42.528
- [laughing]

32:42.561 --> 32:45.331
- What about--
what about his wife Katie?

32:45.364 --> 32:49.501
- Um... lower it down
on the drinking....

32:49.535 --> 32:50.669
[laughter]

32:50.702 --> 32:53.339
So you don't fight with people,

32:53.372 --> 32:55.641
and maybe you can
have more friends.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.743
[laughter]

32:57.776 --> 32:59.078
- Okay.
- Yay.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.579
- What about Jax?

33:00.612 --> 33:02.414
- You are just gonna
be a drunk guy...

33:02.448 --> 33:03.749
- Oh, jeez.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.351
- Sitting in a lodge,

33:05.384 --> 33:08.087
only thinking about

33:08.120 --> 33:09.388
having sex with girls.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.124
[laughter]

33:12.158 --> 33:14.360
- Amen to that.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.163
- I'm beginning to see how
he's Stassi's little brother.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.531
- Yeah.
- Any advice for Ariana?

33:19.565 --> 33:22.401
- Just think about other people.

33:22.434 --> 33:25.104
Because then you're gonna
have no friends.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.672
And you're lucky to have
Scheana right now.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.640
- What is happening?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.442
- What about for Scheana?

33:30.476 --> 33:32.644
- There's no picking a side.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.546
There's no, "Oh, I'm gonna..."

33:34.580 --> 33:35.814
- That's what I try
and tell everyone.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.616
I'm just trying to be
friends with everyone.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.385
- Well--
- I'm not trying to pick sides.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.388
- Well, then maybe all of you
guys should start agreeing.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.423
- Thank you.
- What about Brittany?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.159
- There's no problem with her.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.394
There's just no problem.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.428
- Awww. Yeah.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.662
I love you, Nikolai.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.797
- Yay.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.132
- I know you don't know her,

33:53.165 --> 33:56.068
but anything for
Lisa Vanderpump?

33:56.102 --> 33:59.571
- Keep it up in the, um,
in the business, you know.

33:59.605 --> 34:00.672
- I mean, I would like
to offer you a job.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.873
- Put them to the best.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.610
- Because, you know, maybe you
could be my personal advisor.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.745
- Nikolai, any advice for me
before I let you go?

34:06.778 --> 34:08.247
- No.
- No?

34:08.280 --> 34:09.548
- I don't know anything
that's bad about you.

34:09.581 --> 34:10.716
[laughter]

34:10.749 --> 34:11.817
- Let's keep it that way.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.519
Thanks so much, Nikolai.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.753
It was a pleasure to have you.
[inaudible]

34:14.786 --> 34:16.522
[applause]
- Good job.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.157
- Well, hopefully,
we'll see you again.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.226
- Yeah.
- We'll be right back.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.461
Up next...

34:22.494 --> 34:24.230
do you care about
Stassi's feelings?

34:24.263 --> 34:25.831
- I didn't believe her
for one second.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.199
- That's so sh---y.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.434
- I watch you manipulate people

34:35.107 --> 34:35.607
[light pop music]

34:38.144 --> 34:39.111
*

34:39.145 --> 34:41.380
- I want to talk about
the events leading up

34:41.413 --> 34:42.481
to Katie's wedding.

34:42.514 --> 34:46.585
Kristen, you were so excited
to throw a bridal shower

34:46.618 --> 34:47.819
for your best friend.

34:47.853 --> 34:51.623
But Scheana, it seemed like
the planning made you unhappy.

34:51.657 --> 34:52.691
- Well, I--I wasn't
really included

34:52.724 --> 34:53.825
in the initial planning.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.627
When we were in Montauk,
I found out there was a whole

34:55.661 --> 34:56.762
group chat that
I wasn't a part of

34:56.795 --> 34:58.864
where they were talking about
throwing it on a yacht

34:58.897 --> 35:01.633
and doing all of these
extravagant, expensive things.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.601
- You felt excluded...

35:02.634 --> 35:04.270
- I decide how I spend my money.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.404
- I wanted to be
a part of it, too.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.639
I think it was just something
we just wanted to help.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.141
- Yeah, and I think
it was just--

35:09.175 --> 35:10.709
it was unfair that
it was decided

35:10.742 --> 35:12.244
the three of us would
just split it three ways,

35:12.278 --> 35:13.379
and no one else has to pitch in,

35:13.412 --> 35:14.613
'cause I didn't
think that was fair.

35:14.646 --> 35:15.914
- Well, you didn't have
to pay as much as--

35:15.947 --> 35:18.350
- I did.
I ended up paying...

35:18.384 --> 35:19.351
- I know.
- I'm just saying--

35:19.385 --> 35:20.886
- You don't have to--

35:20.919 --> 35:22.188
- Then don't say I didn't
contribute, because I did.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.389
I spent several hundred--

35:23.422 --> 35:24.256
- We didn't say you
didn't contribute.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.392
- You were just--
oh, my God, okay.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.894
- Lisa, where did you find
a blow-up doll named Katie?

35:28.927 --> 35:31.930
- I heard there was this lady.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.533
Her name was Katie.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.268
- Oh, my God, a blow-up doll?

35:36.302 --> 35:38.504
[all screaming]

35:38.537 --> 35:41.340
- I thought, "A blow-up doll
would just be perfect."

35:41.373 --> 35:42.408
And I walked into this shop.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.542
And I have to be careful.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.212
I mean, I walk in some,
you know, grotty old sex shop.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.313
- Oh, my God.

35:47.346 --> 35:48.347
- You don't have--
I'm in the--

35:48.380 --> 35:50.416
- Like, "Mrs. Vanderpump,
we have your order."

35:50.449 --> 35:51.717
[laughter]

35:51.750 --> 35:53.652
- I'm like, "Do you have
any blow-up dolls?"

35:53.685 --> 35:55.421
So they said, "Well,
we've got this one,

35:55.454 --> 35:56.655
uh, called Katie."

35:56.688 --> 35:59.691
Katie!
I literally had a fit.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.628
- Did you inflate it and
consummate your relationship?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.263
- Well, first of all,
thank you for getting the one

36:04.296 --> 36:05.564
with the tight, realistic ass,

36:05.597 --> 36:06.732
'cause I really appreciate it.

36:06.765 --> 36:07.699
- That was very important.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.769
- Sorry, you can't--
- It says it on the box.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.438
- No, no--it says it on the box.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.206
You blush every time
you read it.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.707
- Have you consummated
your relationship?

36:15.741 --> 36:17.543
- [sighs] We haven't. Um...

36:17.576 --> 36:19.245
- You haven't shagged
with the doll?

36:19.278 --> 36:20.479
- I tried--I tried
to blow it up, but remember,

36:20.512 --> 36:21.980
we couldn't get it.
We had a malfunction.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.250
[air hissing]

36:24.283 --> 36:26.785
- What the...

36:26.818 --> 36:28.287
- [chuckling] No.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.656
Come on. I'm blowing it up
as, like, a gag.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.657
- I'm glad I didn't come in
and have your, like,

36:31.690 --> 36:34.326
pants around your ankles
while you're doing that.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.595
- We got it up, and she hung out
on the couch for a little while,

36:36.628 --> 36:38.597
but I don't--
she quickly got deflated.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.631
- Right.
- Oh!

36:39.665 --> 36:43.469
- Okay, Katie, how generous
was it of Pandora

36:43.502 --> 36:44.736
to give you a spa day
in her house?

36:44.770 --> 36:45.771
- Oh, my God.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.807
No, Pandora is one
of the most generous people.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.576
And she's such a...
- Master host.

36:50.609 --> 36:51.577
- I wonder where she gets that.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.413
- And--I know, exactly.
Exactly.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.781
- Scheana, you were on a mission

36:55.814 --> 36:59.618
to broker peace between
Ariana and Stassi.

36:59.651 --> 37:02.521
Katie, that seemed to make you
furious with Scheana.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.523
- I don't know how it
escalated into, like,

37:04.556 --> 37:05.524
all of a sudden me
and Scheana fighting.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.460
- You're drunk-texting me
all these insults

37:08.494 --> 37:10.529
when you drink too much.
That's the issue.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.831
- Scheana, you're sitting here
acting like you're perfect.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.666
A lot of people feel that
you're fake a lot of times.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.702
- I'm...
- So...

37:16.735 --> 37:18.404
- Then why the f--- are you
friends with me if I'm fake?

37:18.437 --> 37:19.838
I have said I'm sorry!

37:19.871 --> 37:21.840
It was tacky! It was classless!
I'm sorry!

37:21.873 --> 37:24.310
- Calm down.
- No! F--- this!

37:24.343 --> 37:25.477
God!

37:25.511 --> 37:27.279
- When you said for,
like, the 20th time

37:27.313 --> 37:29.581
the deflection of, like, "Well,
when you drink, Katie..."

37:29.615 --> 37:31.383
It's like, it's always like
you got to just throw back

37:31.417 --> 37:33.852
to this convenient narrative
to take the pressure off of you

37:33.885 --> 37:35.421
and deflect from everything
that maybe--

37:35.454 --> 37:36.622
- There was no pressure on me.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.625
You said that I was fake,
and you just said a few things

37:39.658 --> 37:40.726
that were very hurtful,
and I just, like...

37:40.759 --> 37:42.561
- Well, yeah, I mean, but--
- Hit my breaking point.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.296
When you drink, you're
a lot meaner to me

37:44.330 --> 37:45.364
than when you're sober.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.765
- Scheana, come on.

37:46.798 --> 37:47.833
- It's the lack
of emotional control.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.768
- Everyone says it, Katie.
Everyone has said it.

37:49.801 --> 37:50.669
Every single person in here

37:50.702 --> 37:52.604
has made a comment
about your drinking.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.706
- That is--Scheana,
that is really foul.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.041
I hope you know me
better that that.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.142
- I don't think you understand
the difference

37:57.175 --> 37:58.810
between an alcoholic and having
a drinking problem.

37:58.844 --> 37:59.478
- She doesn't have
a drinking problem.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.712
- A drinking problem is when

38:00.746 --> 38:02.548
somebody uses alcohol,

38:02.581 --> 38:04.049
and it negatively
affects their life

38:04.082 --> 38:05.451
and it becomes a problem.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.652
It was a problem in
your relationship.

38:06.685 --> 38:07.686
It's been a problem
in your friendships.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.556
Pretty much everyone here
I think would agree,

38:10.589 --> 38:12.891
at some point your drinking
has been a problem.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.727
- My own boyfriend
is sticking up

38:15.761 --> 38:17.563
for the whore in there!

38:17.596 --> 38:19.831
- You've got an angry,
like, Tequila Katie again.

38:19.865 --> 38:23.402
- The only reason I'm angry is
because of your f---ing mouth.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.504
- You want to look like
a f---ing asshole idiot,

38:25.537 --> 38:26.738
you can continue defending.

38:26.772 --> 38:27.839
- Are you drunk?

38:27.873 --> 38:30.776
I cannot believe you're
doing this to me right now.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.079
- I've never once
called you an alcoholic.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.781
That is a totally
different thing.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.316
- That's fair.
- But I don't have a problem.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.853
- Okay.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.923
- Um, Stassi, you used
to be the girl at Sur

38:44.956 --> 38:47.459
that everybody wanted
to be friends with.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.495
How did it feel when Ariana said

38:49.528 --> 38:50.796
she didn't give
a f--- about you?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.564
[laughter]

38:52.598 --> 38:54.099
- When you say it like that,
it's funny,

38:54.132 --> 38:55.801
but, like, at the time
it wasn't.

38:55.834 --> 38:56.835
I don't understand
what you're doing.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.404
- Because I care about Katie.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.373
I don't give a f--- about you.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.375
- If everybody could
just not come up to me

39:03.409 --> 39:04.943
and start a fight with me,
then maybe I wouldn't have to

39:04.976 --> 39:06.878
tell you that I don't
give a f--- about you.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.915
- Ariana has over and over again
hurt my feelings.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.718
I don't know why she
doesn't like me.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.586
I mean, she said
that I'm annoying,

39:14.620 --> 39:16.154
so, like, I guess that's it.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.425
- Ariana, do you care
about Stassi's feelings?

39:19.458 --> 39:20.759
- I didn't believe her
for one second.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.461
- That's so sh---y.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.430
- You manipulate people
time and time again.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.131
- That has nothing to do--
- You didn't manipulate Jax

39:26.164 --> 39:27.766
over and over again?

39:27.799 --> 39:28.600
She didn't go to lunch
with you...

39:28.634 --> 39:29.868
- She doesn't f---ing
manipulate--

39:29.901 --> 39:31.603
- And James,
and manipulate James?

39:31.637 --> 39:32.838
- I manipulated James.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.706
I took it on myself.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.742
- That's the cherry
on top to a sundae

39:36.775 --> 39:37.843
that you've created yourself.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.446
- You guys continue to put me
in a position where

39:40.479 --> 39:41.780
you ask me questions

39:41.813 --> 39:43.449
knowing you're not gonna
like the answer.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.683
I give you an honest answer,

39:44.716 --> 39:45.784
and then I'm the asshole.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.887
[dramatic music]

39:51.189 --> 39:52.758
- You just think
the worst of me

39:52.791 --> 39:54.760
in every single situation.

40:03.835 --> 40:04.836
- You guys continue to put me
in a position where

40:05.804 --> 40:06.938
you ask me questions,

40:06.972 --> 40:09.508
I give you an honest answer,
and then I'm the asshole.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.009
- You guys hold this
grudge against her

40:11.042 --> 40:12.143
for sh-- that she
never did to you

40:12.177 --> 40:13.945
for a person that
she was years ago--

40:13.979 --> 40:16.181
a person that I saw being
friends with at some point.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.183
But she is not that person.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.317
- That was, like, 2012 Stassi.

40:19.350 --> 40:21.219
She doesn't really have that--
- It's the same person.

40:21.252 --> 40:25.056
There's no 2012 Stassi
and 2016 Stassi.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.558
- Now you've been given
an opportunity

40:26.592 --> 40:28.126
to get to know
who she is today,

40:28.159 --> 40:30.061
and you just write her off
and assume things about her.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.129
- You don't. You don't.
- It's really--

40:31.162 --> 40:32.598
It's really callous.

40:32.631 --> 40:33.965
- I told you at Pandora's house

40:33.999 --> 40:35.467
that I was open to getting
to know you,

40:35.501 --> 40:36.502
and I've been trying to be open,

40:36.535 --> 40:38.136
and then I watch
our conversation

40:38.169 --> 40:39.237
at the wedding, and you said,

40:39.270 --> 40:40.972
"I've been waiting
to crack her."

40:41.006 --> 40:43.208
It's weird; I don't know why
I'm doing this right now.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.643
- It's okay to be emotional.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.845
And don't feel sad
about feeling sad.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.914
I have wanted to crack her

40:48.947 --> 40:51.082
for so long.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.217
- Boom, there it is.
- Ariana, that was--

40:52.250 --> 40:54.953
- There's the exact person I--
- That was so f---ed up.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.054
- That's not mean!

40:56.087 --> 40:57.222
- I knew you were
manipulating me.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.957
- F---ing really?
That's a joke.

40:58.990 --> 40:59.891
Seriously?
- Oh, it's a joke?

40:59.925 --> 41:01.092
- You could just be
joking all the time.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.663
- You just think the worst of me
in every single situation.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.598
- You keep giving me
opportunity, Stassi.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.200
- Saying "I finally cracked her"
isn't mean.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.637
- It's really manipulative.
- No, it's not!

41:11.670 --> 41:13.204
It means I want
to get to know you!

41:13.238 --> 41:15.140
- F---ing talk to her
and that you felt this way.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.943
- Anyone's manipulating people,
it's you two, because I tried--

41:17.976 --> 41:19.277
[overlapping shouting]
- Are you f---ing kidding me?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.512
- You were literally--
do you--

41:20.546 --> 41:22.113
- She was just kidding!

41:22.147 --> 41:24.115
- Then maybe I just don't want
to be friends with somebody

41:24.149 --> 41:25.250
who kids that way!

41:25.283 --> 41:26.284
Is that okay?
- That's fine.

41:26.317 --> 41:30.255
- I don't trust you,
so these "jokes" aren't funny.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.990
- Then we don't need to...
- And that's just it.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.191
- But I--I tried.
- I think you guys have

41:33.224 --> 41:34.693
the most negative f---ing
view on someone.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.194
- I have tried.
- I thought it was bullsh--.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.630
I thought it was
another opportunity

41:38.664 --> 41:39.731
for you to be the victim

41:39.765 --> 41:42.000
so that you have power over
everyone else in the room.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.169
- I'm never the victim!
- Are you f---ing kidding me?

41:44.202 --> 41:46.304
- I'm always the bully!
- Oh, my God, Stassi--

41:46.337 --> 41:47.305
- Am I the victim or the bully?

41:47.338 --> 41:48.940
- You always want people to be

41:48.974 --> 41:51.242
apologizing or working
their way up

41:51.276 --> 41:53.078
to, like, gain your approval.

41:53.111 --> 41:55.180
- No matter what,
you guys will never trust me.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.616
You'll never like me.
That's on you.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.886
[tense music]

42:00.919 --> 42:03.054
- Next week, it's part three

42:03.088 --> 42:05.023
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.125
I feel like Kristen
may sneak in

42:07.158 --> 42:08.259
with an engagement ring.

42:08.293 --> 42:10.261
- I know, I might be able to,
like, trick him into it.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.297
- Hey, me and Schwartz
and you and James,

42:12.330 --> 42:13.298
we'll go on a double date.

42:13.331 --> 42:14.232
- Yeah, we'll double up.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.602
- I hear yelling in the hallway.

42:16.635 --> 42:20.305
I see two guys fighting
about looking like Sia.

42:20.338 --> 42:23.074
- You guys are solely
responsible

42:23.108 --> 42:24.075
for all of our arguments.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.277
- I wasn't trying to be a tyrant
or Bridezilla.

42:26.311 --> 42:27.145
I just really wanted harmony.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.180
- Not once are you guys
telling Katie

42:29.214 --> 42:31.650
that she needs to do anything.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.284
- Mike Shay is gonna
be joining us.

42:33.318 --> 42:34.953
- I don't want to see him.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.922
- I'm really scared for him
to be around all of us.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.356
- I'm too sober for this.

42:38.389 --> 42:42.193
- Shay, when you read that
Scheana has a new boyfriend,

42:42.227 --> 42:43.261
what does that do to your heart?

42:43.294 --> 42:45.296
- I don't know who he is.
I don't care to know.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.232
- You do.
You follow him on Instagram.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.366
- That's the guy you're dating?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.768
- It's hard to...

42:49.801 --> 42:51.703
- I can't even look at you
right now, man.

42:54.305 --> 42:55.774
- To see more
of "Vanderpump Rules,"

42:55.807 --> 42:57.242
