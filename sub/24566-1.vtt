01:51.528 --> 01:54.362
My name
is Michael Sullivan

01:54.364 --> 01:58.073
and I have a story I think
you're gonna wanna hear.

03:02.723 --> 03:04.256
Michael Sullivan?

03:17.364 --> 03:20.697
How long have you been in the
lobbyist at Belasquian Banks?

03:20.699 --> 03:22.240
Uh, two years.

03:22.242 --> 03:24.827
A lot of strategy,
research and support.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.453
Hmm.

03:26.455 --> 03:27.704
That's a good job.

03:27.706 --> 03:29.624
You're not
happy there?

03:29.626 --> 03:33.669
No, I just... I don't want to wake
up when I'm forty and discover

03:33.671 --> 03:36.422
the only thing I've contributed
to the world is tax shelters,

03:36.424 --> 03:39.299
sweatshops and
holes in the ozone.

03:39.301 --> 03:40.844
You're an idealist?

03:41.554 --> 03:43.887
You know for as long
as I can remember

03:43.889 --> 03:46.516
I've wanted to
be a diplomat.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.853
I want to make a
difference in the world.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.399
Your father
was a diplomat.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.526
Uh, yeah, U.S.
State Department, he...

03:57.528 --> 04:00.448
Lebanon. 1983.

04:02.866 --> 04:04.491
I'm sorry
for your loss.

04:08.664 --> 04:10.790
My father passed
away when I was little.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.461
He was killed in the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut

04:16.463 --> 04:17.964
when I
was 5 years old.

04:20.552 --> 04:23.301
One of my earliest memories
is my father telling stories

04:23.303 --> 04:24.887
about the founding
of the United Nations.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.475
We'll find a
way to end war.

04:27.766 --> 04:29.726
Made it sound
like modern day Knights

04:29.728 --> 04:31.394
sitting around
the Round Table.

04:35.442 --> 04:40.820
I wanted to follow
in his footsteps.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.613
By the fall of 2002
I had applied for a job

04:43.615 --> 04:45.699
at the United
Nations four times.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.409
Hey!

04:47.411 --> 04:48.536
Uncle Michael!

04:48.538 --> 04:49.495
My sister says it's
because Foreign Service

04:49.497 --> 04:50.704
is in
our family legacy.

04:50.706 --> 04:52.457
Hey little brother,
how are ya?

04:52.459 --> 04:53.498
Hey, good.
Sorry I'm late.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.375
You look good.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.918
And just
like my mother,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.378
she married a guy she met
while interning at the U.N.

04:58.380 --> 04:59.921
So I got you
something small,

04:59.923 --> 05:01.966
but something else is
on it's way, okay?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.009
Hey, Trevor.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.093
Hey.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.719
Nice cake Lily,
got enough Danish flags?

05:05.721 --> 05:07.137
Yeah, yeah.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.514
Well, did you
hear anything?

05:09.516 --> 05:10.974
Uh, no.

05:10.976 --> 05:12.601
I'll hear tomorrow.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.603
But how'd it feel?

05:14.605 --> 05:15.855
Good?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.815
No, I was
too nervous.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.942
Oh well,
it's their loss.

05:20.944 --> 05:24.029
I'm sure you'll get it, you've
been working so hard for this!

05:24.031 --> 05:25.615
Yeah.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.784
And it's somebody's
birthday, so should we do cake?

05:27.786 --> 05:28.743
Yes!

05:28.745 --> 05:32.079
♪ Happy Birthday
to you! ♪

05:32.081 --> 05:35.625
♪ Happy birthday
to you! ♪

05:35.627 --> 05:38.795
♪ Happy birthday
dear Kate ♪

05:52.644 --> 05:54.476
Best candidates
keep getting hired away

05:54.478 --> 05:56.187
by fucking hedge funds.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.647
Michael Sullivan.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.569
I knew his father.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.199
Danish passport.

06:07.574 --> 06:11.704
His mother's side,
but he's only 24 years old.

06:14.790 --> 06:15.666
He'll do.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.135
I thought I would start with
some entry-level assignment,

06:27.137 --> 06:29.055
instead I got
a dream job.

06:30.514 --> 06:33.517
Special assistant to the
under secretary general.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.685
Running the largest
humanitarian program

06:36.687 --> 06:38.646
in the
United Nations history.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.530
I couldn't
believe my luck.

06:46.613 --> 06:49.950
All I kept thinking
was, "Don't fuck this up."

06:50.617 --> 06:53.243
The program is
called, "Oil For Food."

06:53.245 --> 06:55.079
It's created in 1995.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.291
By Security Council
resolution 986,

06:58.293 --> 07:01.084
which has stated that the
UN would manage the sale

07:01.086 --> 07:05.339
of Iraqi oil and use the profits
to provide humanitarian relief

07:05.341 --> 07:07.925
in the country to
alleviate the hardship.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.926
Which basically
means that our office

07:09.928 --> 07:12.512
is in charge of
trying to feed an entire nation,

07:12.514 --> 07:14.558
over 20 million people.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.441
You have a little
reading to catch up on.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.692
We are woefully behind schedule
on our funding status report

07:24.694 --> 07:25.860
to the
Security Council;

07:25.862 --> 07:28.570
Your immediate task will be to
help facilitate its completion.

07:28.572 --> 07:30.281
Your predecessor
was due to brief

07:30.283 --> 07:31.656
the undersecretary
tomorrow.

07:31.658 --> 07:33.159
Tomorrow?

07:33.161 --> 07:34.284
What happened to him?

07:34.286 --> 07:36.121
A car accident in Iraq.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.094
Jesus Christ!

07:51.096 --> 07:52.094
Is he alright?

07:52.096 --> 07:53.680
No,
he didn't make it.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.889
A bullet-point
summary will do.

07:55.891 --> 07:57.974
Pasha will be in
his office at nine.

08:34.221 --> 08:36.722
Got a couple
of minutes, Michael?

08:36.725 --> 08:39.142
Justin Cutter,
Central Intelligence.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.475
Really?

08:40.477 --> 08:43.438
Yeah, we come in
all shapes and sizes.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.772
Okay, can I help
you with something?

08:45.774 --> 08:49.776
Listen, we think Oil for Food is
being gamed for private gain

08:49.778 --> 08:52.405
by a bad guy or
bad guys unknown.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.364
Possibly with help
from the inside,

08:54.366 --> 08:56.408
which is where
you are, so...

08:56.410 --> 08:58.076
Look I-I just
got this job.

08:58.078 --> 09:00.371
I'm not gonna-
I'm not gonna spy for you.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.580
Oh God, no.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.583
No, no, leave that to
the professionals.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.292
I don't want
you to do anything

09:05.294 --> 09:08.212
that makes you
uncomfortable, Michael.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.757
Just keep your eyes and
ears open, that's all.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.009
For God and Country.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.517
I was aware going in
that the Oil for Food program

09:22.519 --> 09:25.648
had become something
of a political football.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.984
The program budget was
10 billon dollars a year.

09:30.986 --> 09:34.781
The entire rest of the UN
operational budget was only two.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.784
There was crazy
money to be had.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.536
Special interest
circling like buzzards.

09:41.538 --> 09:43.289
The program was simple.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.041
Because of the
economic sanctions imposed

09:45.043 --> 09:46.584
against Saddam Hussein

09:46.586 --> 09:50.504
after the first Gulf War,
Iraq's economy had crashed.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.422
People were
starving and dying

09:52.424 --> 09:56.009
from lack of basic
medicine and staples.

09:56.011 --> 09:58.304
The Oil for Food program
was designed to provide

09:58.306 --> 10:02.016
Iraqi citizens with what
they needed to survive.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.060
While at the same time,
preventing Saddam

10:04.062 --> 10:06.938
from developing his alleged
weapons of mass destruction.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.483
Under UN supervision,

10:10.485 --> 10:13.276
Iraqi oil was being sold
at market prices

10:13.278 --> 10:15.365
to pay
for humanitarian aid.

10:16.448 --> 10:20.033
Our job was to keep it funded
by making sure everything

10:20.035 --> 10:21.453
went by the book.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.122
I'm here to
present the summary.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.873
He'll be with
you in a minute.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.916
...This fucking
regime!

10:27.918 --> 10:29.042
Unbelievable.

10:29.044 --> 10:32.546
Yes, I sorted it as
always, a solution.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.590
Now we-we charted
a load of taxis, filled them,

10:35.592 --> 10:37.509
that should last
the outlying villages

10:37.511 --> 10:39.054
till we get
the trucks back.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.475
You call
this a summary?

10:46.395 --> 10:48.603
Fucking war and peace.

10:48.605 --> 10:50.605
Sorry sir, I was
trying to be thorough.

10:50.607 --> 10:52.150
Thorough?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.943
Yes, sir.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.487
Fuck.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.281
Well, just give me
the highlights kid,

10:58.283 --> 11:00.199
otherwise we'll be
here till spring thaw.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.536
Yes we have uhh, decreased
the malnutrition rate,

11:03.538 --> 11:06.830
reduced child mortality,
we've also uhh,

11:06.832 --> 11:11.502
made big strides in access
to water and electricity.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.588
There are
however some umm,

11:13.590 --> 11:16.340
systemic distribution failures
particularly in the North.

11:16.342 --> 11:21.304
The Kurds are getting shorted
uhh, wheat, milk, diesel fuel

11:21.306 --> 11:24.515
to the benefit of Tikrit,
who are getting seemingly

11:24.517 --> 11:25.724
more than
their fair share.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.935
Saddam's hometown,
what a surprise?

11:28.937 --> 11:30.188
Yeah.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.982
There are also all these
after service fees uhh,

11:32.984 --> 11:35.193
in the contracts.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.027
I'm pretty sure
they're kick-backs.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.156
If you wanna take a look, I uhh,
highlighted and aggregated them

11:40.158 --> 11:42.951
on page 26 to 29.

11:51.251 --> 11:53.002
It's a lot
of money, sir.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.548
In some places it's
as much as 30 percent.

12:02.971 --> 12:04.638
Sit.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.557
Kid.

12:07.559 --> 12:08.727
Sit down.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.772
The first rule of
diplomacy is that

12:13.774 --> 12:15.775
the truth is not
a matter of fact,

12:15.777 --> 12:18.026
it's a matter of consensus,
now consensus right now

12:18.028 --> 12:19.778
is that
sanctions are here to stay.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.031
The Americans and The
British will never lift them,

12:22.033 --> 12:26.661
which means that if you want
the people of Iraq to survive,

12:26.663 --> 12:28.787
we have to keep
Oil for Food running.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.580
Even with all
it's warts and flaws.

12:30.582 --> 12:31.999
Sir, you do
not need to...

12:32.001 --> 12:34.877
The second rule is to keep
your mouth shut and listen.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.628
Then if it suits,
you can talk.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.839
With discretion.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.469
Otherwise, keep your
cards, close to your vest.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.096
Yeah.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.605
Your father
was a good man.

12:58.235 --> 13:01.695
You should be so lucky
as to have his heart.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.323
Yeah, so
I've been told.

13:04.033 --> 13:07.826
We crossed paths
a couple of times.

13:07.828 --> 13:11.750
Must have
been 79', 80'.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.835
What a tragedy.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.629
Beirut.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.759
Fuck, I'm sorry.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.472
That must have been hard, a
boy growing up without a father.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.056
It was my normal.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.559
I had my cry.

13:34.063 --> 13:40.693
Good.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.570
Fix your summary.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.530
Go home and pack.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.991
We leave for
Baghdad on the red-eye.

13:46.993 --> 13:47.949
Uhh...

13:47.951 --> 13:50.953
What?
You have other plans?

13:50.955 --> 13:53.873
No, I don't.

13:53.875 --> 13:54.916
Of course not.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.041
Thank you.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.705
I was swept up
in the romance of it,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.833
I mean,
this is what I wanted.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.504
High adventure
and a worthy cause.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.341
It's like
Baghdad was my Casablanca.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.177
More or less sketchy,
crazy dangerous and stranger

14:49.179 --> 14:50.848
than I could've
ever imagined.

14:52.017 --> 14:55.727
The country lived in a state
of permanent self-occupation.

14:55.729 --> 14:59.188
Our Baghdad office is
going to present a problem.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.522
Okay.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.026
We can't let this
director sabotage the report.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.027
Why-why would he
sabotage his own report?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.653
She.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.739
So the Security Council will be
forced to lift the sanctions,

15:08.741 --> 15:11.993
and everybody can cash in on the
deals they made with Saddam back

15:11.995 --> 15:15.831
before he rolled into
Kuwait and pissed off the world.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.041
Jesus H. Christ, kid.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.045
Gonna have to fucking teach
you everything from scratch.

15:22.047 --> 15:26.965
Every six months we have to
justify our continued existence.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.636
Our job right now is to write a
report for the Security Council

15:30.638 --> 15:34.556
emphasizing all the good in
the Oil for Food program

15:34.558 --> 15:37.560
whilst minimizing
the challenges.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.145
Not to lie.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.064
No, never lie,

15:41.066 --> 15:47.820
but to choose our facts or
truths with the utmost care.

15:47.822 --> 15:48.988
Right.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.079
Can I trust you
to do that?

15:57.039 --> 15:59.250
Yes. Absolutely.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.068
There she is.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.945
Madame Dupre.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.990
Trying to backstab us.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.701
Christina.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.248
Hassan Ghazarian.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.206
Hey, Michael Sullivan.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.208
Nice to meet you.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.209
Nice to meet you.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.839
Did you get the
documents I sent you?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.092
I did, I've even
printed them up for you.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.343
Oh great.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.930
You write well.

16:56.765 --> 17:00.892
60 percent of the Iraqi
people are solely dependent

17:00.894 --> 17:04.146
upon our
suppliers for survival.

17:04.147 --> 17:08.233
Wheat, grain, milk, medicine,
essential infrastructure.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.988
During our last ten months, we
have decreased malnutrition rate

17:11.990 --> 17:15.240
amongst children
in Iraq by 50 percent,

17:15.242 --> 17:20.287
thereby reduced
child mortality significantly.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.789
Okay, thank you very much,
photographers come through.

17:22.790 --> 17:25.375
We're gonna have a photo
opportunity with Madame Dupre.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.797
It's hard to
overstate how badly Saddam

17:30.799 --> 17:32.760
was abusing
his people.

17:33.178 --> 17:36.345
Friends of the regime could
get easy access to the medicine.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.265
Others less fortunate
were left to die

17:39.267 --> 17:41.351
from even the
simplest of diseases.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.149
They send bad drugs.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.986
Dump on us their
out-of-date prescriptions.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.113
Thank him for uhh,
bringing this to me

17:54.115 --> 17:56.365
and tell him I will
definitely look into it.

17:59.287 --> 18:04.332
He says there's at black
market with Oil for Food pills.

18:12.342 --> 18:16.302
Or this innocent child: Please
explain to her why she cannot

18:16.304 --> 18:20.055
have the stem cell
therapy that could cure her.

18:20.057 --> 18:23.392
Why she has to suffer because
the West begrudges Iraq,

18:23.394 --> 18:25.312
it's dignity.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.526
That I can't
explain, no.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.374
She asks
why you are crying?

18:59.180 --> 19:04.392
I promise I will do anything
I can to help your child.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.202
It sickens me to have to stand
there and listen to your lies.

19:24.204 --> 19:28.790
It's P.R., Christina, everyone
in the field is working so hard.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.500
Well, my reporter for
The Security Council

19:30.502 --> 19:32.504
is going to
tell the truth.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.632
Just so you know.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.093
Your report.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.094
The program
is a failure.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.138
The sanctions
aren't working.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.430
How is the
program failing?

19:43.432 --> 19:44.474
Medicine is
getting through!

19:44.476 --> 19:45.475
At what cost!?

19:45.477 --> 19:46.517
People are
getting basic staples.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.143
At what cost?

19:48.145 --> 19:50.438
Everybody is
grifting the system.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.230
Corruption grows
like a cancer.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.607
It'll never be
perfect and surely,

19:53.609 --> 19:56.736
it's better than
doing nothing.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.446
Michael,
what's the delay?

19:58.448 --> 20:00.448
Uhh, sorry, there's a
small security issue.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.824
We'll be on our way
in a few moments.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.702
I know
what you're doing.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.331
You want me to sign off
on your moral relativism

20:08.333 --> 20:11.417
so you can throw me under
the bus when it all unravels.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.251
You are mistaken.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.711
I'm just trying
to feed a country.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.756
Enough spin,
Costa, enough!

20:16.758 --> 20:18.507
The facts will
speak for themselves.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.301
My report with
The Security Council

20:20.303 --> 20:21.844
is going to
tell the truth.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.504
Baghdad is the centre
of the universe now, kid.

20:56.506 --> 20:59.673
And this,
Al Rasheed is ground zero.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.008
Boiler room of diplomacy.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.354
Pasha!

21:14.356 --> 21:16.356
Nice to see you again.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.360
Mr. Mohammed,
my assistant.

21:19.362 --> 21:20.819
Michael Sullivan.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.529
Count your fingers after you
shake hands with this one.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.365
All major intelligence
agencies are here,

21:25.367 --> 21:27.535
and all
rooms are bugged.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.036
Everyone trying
to barter in their secrets

21:29.038 --> 21:30.537
and their services.

21:30.539 --> 21:36.544
Information is everything;
the currency, the power.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.046
Look. Listen. Learn.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.135
Everyone has their
own agenda, huh?

21:45.137 --> 21:48.597
Baby Bush thinks Saddam
disrespected his papa.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.182
American neocons?

21:50.184 --> 21:53.061
They're convinced democracy will
bloom here like a fucking flower

21:53.063 --> 21:54.644
...good luck with that.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.565
Putin wants Bush to fail,
China wants the new markets,

21:57.567 --> 21:59.025
half of Europe
couldn't care less

21:59.027 --> 22:01.943
whether Saddam gasses
civilians or builds a bomb

22:01.945 --> 22:05.448
Big Oil simply wants
an end to the sanctions

22:05.450 --> 22:08.327
so they can
suck at the Iraqi teat.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.959
So, about what the
doctor told me today.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.630
The grifted medicine,
missing supplies.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.006
I smell a setup.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.882
It didn't really
feel like a setup.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.426
More nonsense
from Madame.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.179
She's not just ineffective,
she's actively inventing proof

22:28.181 --> 22:29.721
of the
program's failings.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.600
If we don't do something, this
reports gonna be a disaster.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.227
Don't you
get the final say?

22:34.229 --> 22:36.645
Sadly, no.

22:36.647 --> 22:41.484
UN protocol requires the
regional director sign off

22:41.486 --> 22:44.821
on the report.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.698
And what's our agenda?

22:46.700 --> 22:48.824
Our agenda?

22:48.826 --> 22:51.119
That little girl.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.496
At the hospital.

22:53.498 --> 22:57.208
God help anyone
who gets in our way.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.459
Yeah.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.604
I had a son once.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.611
Died of
the flu, just a baby.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.031
Can you
believe that?

23:28.657 --> 23:34.663
And my wife, we
couldn't make another.

23:37.625 --> 23:38.625
Sorry.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.961
Thirty years ago.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.965
How did you put it?

23:45.508 --> 23:46.884
I had my cry.

23:51.056 --> 23:51.890
Flu.

23:56.060 --> 23:56.894
You tired?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.105
No.

23:59.564 --> 24:00.645
Youth.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.940
Fuck.

24:15.538 --> 24:18.664
You know, for someone who speaks
for other people for a living,

24:18.666 --> 24:20.084
you don't talk much.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.672
I couldn't help but notice
you were not surprised

24:26.674 --> 24:29.677
when the doctor spoke of
black market medicine.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.303
No I wasn't.

24:34.348 --> 24:35.808
Will you
tell your boss?

24:37.143 --> 24:41.562
Yeah, we already know there's
some corruption in the program.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.315
Outside Baghdad
it's much worse.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.110
Rations diverted,
power cut off.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.779
Extortion, bribes.

24:51.324 --> 24:54.786
I'll uhh, make sure
Pasha knows that too.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.341
You have something
you want to ask me?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.927
Is it
about Madame?

25:12.929 --> 25:15.595
That your boss wants you
to find the secret button

25:15.597 --> 25:18.350
he can push to bend
her to his will?

25:18.727 --> 25:23.729
I can tell you:
it does not exist.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.482
I'm just trying
to do my job.

25:35.367 --> 25:39.873
But your
predecessor Abhek...

25:41.040 --> 25:44.043
His car accident was
not an accident.

25:47.963 --> 25:51.091
That's a pretty big
accusation to make.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.865
Why are you
telling me this?

26:16.284 --> 26:19.037
He was murdered because
of something he uncovered.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.205
Something in
Oil for Food?

26:22.207 --> 26:24.207
I don't know.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.250
Maybe.

26:26.419 --> 26:30.212
He was fearful of
someone inside United Nations.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.424
A facilitator
of corruption.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.221
You need to be
very, very careful.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.138
Good evening.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.389
Please.

27:29.273 --> 27:32.482
The Mukhabarat, you see,
were concerned to inspect

27:32.484 --> 27:34.276
your sleeping chambers
for the existence

27:34.278 --> 27:36.071
of any
surveillance device.

27:36.405 --> 27:40.158
This as a courtesy, for
your security, of course.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.076
Why don't you start by
telling me who you are?

27:43.078 --> 27:45.621
Are you enjoying your visit
to Mesopotamia, Mr. Sullivan?

27:46.750 --> 27:49.083
First one,
if I'm not mistaken yes?

27:49.085 --> 27:52.378
Such a difficult, stressful
time for everyone here.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.796
The Great Satan keeps
threatening to bomb the city

27:54.798 --> 27:58.343
meanwhile, the
sanctions cut deep.

27:58.345 --> 27:59.344
Baghdad puts...

27:59.346 --> 28:01.013
Why don't you
get to the point?

28:03.641 --> 28:05.725
You will find on
the bureau behind me

28:05.727 --> 28:08.353
an envelope containing
a small honorarium.

28:08.355 --> 28:11.146
We greatly admire the work you
are doing for the Iraqi...

28:11.148 --> 28:12.648
It's late.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.844
I'd like you
to leave, please.

28:20.991 --> 28:27.037
No disrespect
was meant by it.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.891
Don't forget your envelope.

28:57.487 --> 29:00.363
Can't blame them for
trying, it's nothing.

29:00.365 --> 29:01.700
You handled it perfectly.

29:05.036 --> 29:08.456
What about what the
interpreter said about Abhek?

29:09.499 --> 29:11.209
I don't believe it.

29:11.792 --> 29:15.587
Maybe she's a spy for
Saddam sent to rattle us.

29:18.258 --> 29:19.507
You look
like shit, kid.

29:19.509 --> 29:22.095
Fuck,
eat something.

29:35.817 --> 29:36.815
I'm sorry.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.652
Excuse me?

29:42.615 --> 29:45.408
I'd been warned,
but I was still shocked

29:45.410 --> 29:48.288
by the criticism from UN staff
against the sanctions.

29:49.038 --> 29:52.289
Pasha was right, every
department had an agenda.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.292
They were working
across purposes.

29:54.294 --> 29:58.755
They played right into
Madame Dupre's hands.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.306
Shut up!

30:10.894 --> 30:13.438
You sound like
Saddam's puppets all of you.

30:14.064 --> 30:16.521
Do I need to point out the
serious fucking consequences

30:16.523 --> 30:18.607
to the Iraqi people,
if we fail to continue...

30:18.609 --> 30:19.441
You violated...

30:20.319 --> 30:24.447
Are you
fucking kidding me!?

30:24.449 --> 30:26.449
It's not our place
to question the decisions

30:26.451 --> 30:30.952
of The Security Council.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.456
We implement them.

30:34.041 --> 30:38.335
Absent of
all politics.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.924
And yes, it's a hard
fucking job sometimes.

30:43.926 --> 30:45.759
But if
you can't do it,

30:45.761 --> 30:48.972
I suggest you turn in your
fucking credentials and go home.

31:00.693 --> 31:01.942
I knew
from my research

31:01.944 --> 31:04.778
that our biggest worry
was Kurdistan.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.699
As long as Saddam was
in power it was gonna take

31:07.701 --> 31:10.075
all of Pasha's considerable
diplomatic skills

31:10.077 --> 31:13.121
to keep the Kurd's from
undermining the report.

31:13.123 --> 31:18.543
The rations, when they come, are
always half what was promised.

31:18.545 --> 31:20.795
The North is a protectorate,
so unfortunately...

31:20.797 --> 31:23.171
They had been hurt
harder under the sanctions

31:23.173 --> 31:26.008
than any other region
and while Oil for Food

31:26.010 --> 31:28.510
was providing
some relief,

31:28.512 --> 31:30.971
it had helped sustain the very
regime that oppressed them.

31:30.973 --> 31:34.142
The Kurds have plenty
of money to buy their own food,

31:34.144 --> 31:35.809
from that
black market oil.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.144
Minister, if you
would allow me...

31:37.146 --> 31:39.188
The Kurdish
conflict with Iraq goes back

31:39.190 --> 31:41.026
nearly a century.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.651
Saddam Hussein took
it to a whole new level.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.988
Forced displacement,
mass detention and torture.

31:47.990 --> 31:51.074
And then, when that didn't work,
he resorted to landmines

31:51.076 --> 31:53.119
and cluster bombs,
sarin gas

31:53.121 --> 31:55.037
and nerve agents Killing
tens of thousands

31:55.039 --> 31:58.165
and crippling tens of
thousands more.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.125
A reign of
terror that included

32:00.127 --> 32:02.879
the worst single act of chemical
genocide ever committed

32:02.881 --> 32:04.963
against a
civilian population.

32:04.965 --> 32:08.676
Kurds are dying for
simply being Kurdish.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.553
And in a shuttle
diplomacy between

32:10.555 --> 32:14.140
two sworn enemies,
I watched Pasha work his magic.

32:14.142 --> 32:17.267
...About how the
most beloved food to Allah,

32:17.269 --> 32:20.438
is that which is touched
by many hands.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.271
Fuck!

32:21.273 --> 32:22.315
This is all I need.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.607
The Kurdish Minister's
right though,

32:23.609 --> 32:24.901
from what
I've been told,

32:24.903 --> 32:25.901
they're getting
completely screwed.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.569
I know he's right.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.698
It's in the fucking field reports,
but we have to keep a lid on it.

32:30.700 --> 32:33.241
The choice can't be to
feed everyone or feed no one.

32:33.243 --> 32:37.162
It has to be to feed
as many as possible.

32:41.211 --> 32:44.003
I have to go back to
New York tomorrow.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.171
I need you
to stay focused.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.008
Of course.

32:48.926 --> 32:50.176
Here's your
travel itinerary.

32:50.178 --> 32:53.723
You are connected to
Kuwait, you land in JFK at 5 PM.

32:55.724 --> 32:59.267
Dupre is going to freeze
you out for the final report.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.230
Her opus
indictment of Oil for Food.

33:03.942 --> 33:08.151
Okay, then why am
I staying here then?

33:08.153 --> 33:10.196
In a few days, you'll
receive some photographs.

33:10.198 --> 33:12.030
You'll want
Hassan to see them

33:12.032 --> 33:14.074
because you won't understand
what they could mean.

33:14.076 --> 33:17.161
Your task is to make sure
he shows them to Dupre

33:17.163 --> 33:18.832
by insisting
he shouldn't.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.709
You're asking
me if I'll...

33:22.711 --> 33:23.918
A trap, yes.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.254
She'll fall into it,
and we'll be rid of her.

33:30.218 --> 33:33.219
Kid,
it's diplomacy,

33:33.221 --> 33:36.180
which sometimes requires
removing obstacles

33:36.182 --> 33:38.018
that stand in the way of
successful outcome.

33:42.230 --> 33:44.274
Can I trust you
again with this one?

33:46.859 --> 33:49.861
I mean, how big of a lie
am I gonna be telling?

33:49.863 --> 33:50.864
Not lie.

33:52.865 --> 33:55.451
Just the opportunity to
draw a wrong conclusion.

34:16.347 --> 34:17.353
Morning.

34:36.117 --> 34:39.911
Just so you know, Madame says
you won't be reading the report

34:39.913 --> 34:43.206
until it's finished
and she sign off on it.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.166
Well, Pasha said he
wants me to help.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.501
People in hell
want ice water.

34:47.503 --> 34:51.338
We're just ponds in a
bigger game, you and me.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.509
Sorry, Michael.

34:54.135 --> 34:54.969
Hassan.

34:56.346 --> 35:00.016
At least you can help me arrange
an interpreter for a field trip.

35:02.226 --> 35:05.228
I wanna open one of these boxes
and check the expiration dates.

35:07.065 --> 35:08.523
He says he's the
company representative.

35:08.525 --> 35:11.066
Tell him I wanna open
one of these boxes.

35:24.541 --> 35:26.459
These pills
expired in 1999.

35:29.378 --> 35:32.546
Sick people will get
sicker or die because of these.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.175
Every box
needs to be checked,

35:37.177 --> 35:39.220
the out of date
medicine needs to be destroyed

35:39.222 --> 35:41.264
and the manufacture
will have to replace it

35:41.266 --> 35:42.599
at their own expense.

35:51.275 --> 35:55.237
I should warn you, everyone
here thinks I'm your prostitute.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.158
Well, I guess we should
split the check then.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.409
You can't really
just have a date

36:02.411 --> 36:04.579
with an un-chaperoned
woman in Iraq.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.789
There are rituals
and traditions.

36:06.791 --> 36:09.085
Do you wanna
call it off then?

36:11.588 --> 36:14.423
Did you tell your boss
what I said about Ahbek?

36:17.217 --> 36:18.677
Yeah I did, he uhh...

36:19.471 --> 36:22.097
He thinks you might
be a government spy.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.278
So are you?
A spy?

36:37.237 --> 36:38.614
Is that
a serious question?

36:39.449 --> 36:42.159
Well, that's a
pretty evasive answer.

36:43.869 --> 36:51.333
No.

36:51.335 --> 36:53.671
Now it's
my turn to ask you.

36:54.422 --> 36:55.340
Okay.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.508
What are you
doing here?

36:59.510 --> 37:02.387
Well umm, I'm doing
a status report

37:02.389 --> 37:04.722
for the Oil for Food program
and then I'm gonna...

37:05.684 --> 37:09.309
I mean today, with
the spoiled medicine.

37:09.311 --> 37:13.481
What you did had nothing to
do with writing your report.

37:13.483 --> 37:14.776
You took action.

37:15.527 --> 37:18.487
It was risky
and rather brave.

37:19.739 --> 37:21.699
Was that just
to impress me?

37:24.744 --> 37:27.288
I'm not here to
just be a functionary.

37:28.664 --> 37:32.793
I took this job for a reason
because I wanna help people

37:34.545 --> 37:38.338
and I wanna
make a difference.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.883
Make a difference?

37:40.885 --> 37:42.220
Exactly.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.266
I'll drink to that.

37:47.391 --> 37:48.393
Cheers.

37:52.438 --> 37:53.771
They're not
gonna bomb Baghdad,

37:53.773 --> 37:55.731
not without getting
The UN staffers out first.

37:55.733 --> 37:56.566
Mr. Sullivan?

37:56.568 --> 37:57.483
Yeah?

37:57.485 --> 37:58.525
This has
come for you.

37:58.527 --> 38:00.028
Thanks.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.362
Lil, I gotta go.

38:01.364 --> 38:02.487
Who sent this?

38:02.489 --> 38:04.490
It was left on the
night desk, sir.

38:20.592 --> 38:22.133
Are those
Oil for Food trucks?

38:22.135 --> 38:25.010
Yeah, but I don't know
the source of them.

38:25.012 --> 38:28.597
If they're real, they're
proof that we're being gamed

38:28.599 --> 38:30.057
by Saddam's regime.

38:30.059 --> 38:32.559
Yeah, If, I still don't
think we should trust them.

38:32.561 --> 38:36.023
Using our trucks to deliver
weapons, I mean, what the fuck?

38:36.940 --> 38:39.525
I'm just gonna pack them up
into a courier pouch,

38:39.527 --> 38:41.443
see what Pasha says.

38:41.445 --> 38:42.739
No, no, no.

38:44.574 --> 38:45.865
Let me show
Christina first.

38:45.867 --> 38:48.492
No, no, no chance.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.746
It's okay,
what do you call it?

38:51.414 --> 38:52.582
"Chain of command."

38:55.501 --> 38:56.335
Okay.

39:23.862 --> 39:24.987
Hi.

39:24.989 --> 39:27.699
Hey.

39:27.701 --> 39:30.200
I need to show
you something.

39:30.202 --> 39:31.621
Okay.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.713
They are friends.

39:41.715 --> 39:42.716
Okay.

40:21.378 --> 40:26.175
So, this place
isn't here, officially.

40:27.052 --> 40:29.927
These are the graves
of Kurdish civilians that

40:29.929 --> 40:33.432
Saddam Hussein one day decided
no longer needed to live.

40:34.726 --> 40:38.144
Gas,
Sarin, Tabun, VX.

40:38.146 --> 40:40.065
The smell
of sweet apples.

40:42.400 --> 40:46.735
He doesn't care about your
sanctions or resolutions.

40:46.737 --> 40:50.449
He's the Angel of
Death... Azrael.

40:52.869 --> 40:53.870
You're Kurdish.

40:55.288 --> 40:58.541
My parents were
intellectuals, active in PUK.

41:00.710 --> 41:02.378
Killed in Halabdja.

41:04.088 --> 41:04.963
I'm sorry.

41:06.382 --> 41:09.758
Nobody in Baghdad knows
I'm Kurdish, Michael.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.344
If Saddam's
police find out.

41:11.346 --> 41:14.097
They will
disappear me.

41:14.099 --> 41:17.432
My friends, they helped Ahbek
uncover a criminal conspiracy

41:17.434 --> 41:21.313
Saddam is using to skim billions
of dollars from Oil for Food.

41:23.023 --> 41:25.900
Ahbek claimed there is a
whole system of corruption that

41:25.902 --> 41:28.735
reaches to the highest levels of
the same Western government

41:28.737 --> 41:30.489
that supports sanctions.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.574
Okay, how did
Ahbek know this?

41:33.576 --> 41:35.827
There is
a rumor of a list.

41:35.829 --> 41:38.912
A list that contains names
of people and organizations

41:38.914 --> 41:42.041
all over the world who are all
getting paid off by Saddam

41:42.043 --> 41:44.253
to keep
this system running.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.713
And Ahbek
had seen it.

41:46.715 --> 41:47.713
Did you bring it?

41:47.715 --> 41:48.715
Yes.

41:48.717 --> 41:50.383
May have
had it on his computer.

41:50.385 --> 41:51.925
You sure
nobody saw you?

41:51.927 --> 41:55.345
The office was empty,
everyone had gone home.

41:55.347 --> 41:56.972
Ahbek, what's
going on with you?

41:56.974 --> 42:00.642
I'm going North
across the border.

42:00.644 --> 42:02.188
It's not safe
for me here.

42:18.746 --> 42:20.164
He made a back up.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.168
But it's encrypted.

42:26.003 --> 42:28.422
We don't have the
resources to decipher it.

42:32.010 --> 42:35.094
Why didn't you take it to
someone more senior in The UN?

42:35.096 --> 42:36.179
I mean, anyone.

42:36.181 --> 42:37.220
Madame Dupre?

42:37.222 --> 42:39.974
Nobody would
listen to her.

42:39.976 --> 42:43.394
It's important who
delivers the list.

42:43.396 --> 42:45.854
No one can accuse you
of being Partisan

42:45.856 --> 42:48.231
or of having any
agenda but the truth.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.319
I'm not gonna
front this, Nashim.

42:51.237 --> 42:53.320
I'm not
gonna do that.

42:53.322 --> 42:54.613
No, I don't
want that.

42:54.615 --> 42:57.909
I just want you to take it back
with you and find someone

42:57.911 --> 42:59.704
who can break
the encryption.

43:00.204 --> 43:03.875
Then, together we
can decide what to do.

43:32.027 --> 43:32.901
Shit!

43:32.903 --> 43:33.905
It's the Mukhabarat.

43:37.242 --> 43:40.327
Are you fucking
kidding me, Jesus!

43:54.759 --> 43:57.885
There must be
a mistake, I'm a UN official.

43:57.887 --> 43:58.930
The young diplomat.

44:00.389 --> 44:03.141
You know it's very
dangerous for you to be in this

44:03.143 --> 44:05.394
god forsaken
desert unescorted.

44:05.978 --> 44:08.396
The Mukhabarat were concerned
that you might have been

44:08.398 --> 44:10.858
kidnapped by
nefarious individuals.

44:12.735 --> 44:14.945
Consider this a courtesy.

44:15.362 --> 44:16.498
Your Papers.

44:27.708 --> 44:30.083
I tell you this, with all
humility, Mr. Sullivan

44:30.085 --> 44:31.918
because I'm
sure it won't happen again.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.503
Your recent visit to

44:33.505 --> 44:35.965
the pharmaceutical
distribution service

44:35.967 --> 44:40.094
that was unnecessarily
provocative, yes?

44:40.096 --> 44:42.597
It would be in everyone's
best interest, in the future,

44:42.599 --> 44:48.561
were to decide such inspections
were no longer necessary.

44:51.148 --> 44:53.317
She is my interpreter
alright! I told you!

45:06.539 --> 45:08.956
Go! Now.

45:08.958 --> 45:10.749
Before they
change their minds.

45:10.751 --> 45:12.668
Get in the car.

45:28.353 --> 45:29.476
He kept my papers.

45:31.690 --> 45:35.360
It's only a question of time now
before they find out who I am.

46:05.681 --> 46:07.182
Nashim Huesseni.

46:14.398 --> 46:16.398
- Where is the girl?
- What girl?

46:16.400 --> 46:17.983
The Kurdish girl?

46:17.985 --> 46:19.068
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're lying!

46:19.070 --> 46:20.528
- I-I don't know what you're talking about!
- Don't lie!

46:20.530 --> 46:21.862
I don't know
where she is.

46:21.864 --> 46:23.197
We saw you
with her!

46:23.199 --> 46:24.907
Yeah, I know, but I don't
know where she is, okay.

46:24.909 --> 46:28.702
Let me just...
Let me just make a call.

46:28.704 --> 46:30.331
I don't know
where she is.

46:31.248 --> 46:32.623
Get out!

46:32.625 --> 46:34.541
You have no
jurisdiction here!

46:34.543 --> 46:35.502
Out!

46:46.056 --> 46:50.307
It's Michael Sullivan with
The Baghdad Oil for Food office.

46:50.309 --> 46:51.143
Yeah.

46:52.478 --> 46:53.312
Yeah.

46:54.773 --> 46:57.525
I need to arrange a UNLP
for one of our staffers.

46:58.693 --> 46:59.527
Mhm.

47:00.903 --> 47:04.907
And the name is
Nashim Huesseni.

47:18.672 --> 47:19.753
Hey.

47:19.755 --> 47:21.338
I took all
I could carry.

47:21.340 --> 47:23.090
This will get you
into the U.S.

47:23.092 --> 47:25.885
The High Commission for Refugees
will help you get a visa.

47:25.887 --> 47:26.927
I don't know.

47:26.929 --> 47:28.679
I can go to
Kurdish part of Turkey.

47:28.681 --> 47:29.972
I have some
friends there.

47:29.974 --> 47:31.724
No, you'll be
safer in New York.

47:31.726 --> 47:32.974
We'll get you to
The U.S.

47:32.976 --> 47:36.144
then we de-encrypt
the list together.

47:38.023 --> 47:40.691
Go, you cannot
be seen with me.

47:40.693 --> 47:44.945
Whatever happens...

47:44.947 --> 47:46.949
Just promise me
you'll let me know.

47:48.952 --> 47:53.121
Whatever happens,
happens.

47:53.123 --> 47:54.374
Right?

48:00.963 --> 48:01.922
Thank you.

48:04.050 --> 48:05.010
Thank you.

48:24.153 --> 48:26.112
Would you please
come to my office?

48:26.114 --> 48:27.740
Immediately.

48:31.744 --> 48:34.037
Did you really expect me
to fall for these...

48:34.039 --> 48:36.039
These, I don't even know
what to call them.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.166
Garbage.

48:38.168 --> 48:39.958
What was the plan?

48:39.960 --> 48:41.793
Trick me into
releasing them?

48:41.795 --> 48:44.796
And then force me out when the
evidence comes that it's false?

48:44.798 --> 48:47.592
I'm at a loss to even know
what you're talking about.

48:47.594 --> 48:49.885
Madame, I was sent some
documents and Hassam

48:49.887 --> 48:51.970
wanted to show them
to you, that's it.

48:51.972 --> 48:54.974
You are finished in
the UN, do you hear me?

48:54.976 --> 48:56.099
Your career is over!

48:56.101 --> 48:57.851
What would you
have him do?

48:57.853 --> 48:59.186
He got
some photos...

48:59.188 --> 49:00.188
Shame on you.

49:00.190 --> 49:01.900
Shame on
both of you!

49:04.027 --> 49:05.776
The report
is finished.

49:05.778 --> 49:09.030
It tells the truth about
the failure of Oil For Food.

49:09.032 --> 49:12.909
The files are digital,
watermarked, time, date

49:12.911 --> 49:16.704
and I have secure copies so
you can't change anything

49:16.706 --> 49:18.164
when it goes
to New York.

49:18.166 --> 49:21.041
The battle is over,
Costa, and you have lost.

49:21.043 --> 49:22.876
The Security Council
will make their decision

49:22.878 --> 49:24.670
based on the facts.

49:34.181 --> 49:38.016
She's not budging.

49:38.018 --> 49:40.144
Well, fuck.

49:40.146 --> 49:42.646
Nothing more for
you to do there, kid.

49:42.648 --> 49:45.023
Take the next UN
flight and come home.

49:47.070 --> 49:48.276
Don't worry about it.

50:09.925 --> 50:13.927
Excuse me sir,
can I see your passport?

50:13.929 --> 50:15.139
Uh, yeah sure.

50:24.190 --> 50:25.273
Mr. Sullivan?

50:25.275 --> 50:27.027
I'm gonna need you
to come with us.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.382
Michael,
how're you doing?

50:51.925 --> 50:53.342
I have
nothing for you.

50:53.344 --> 50:56.262
No, that's okay,
I got something for you.

50:56.264 --> 50:59.768
Christina Dupre is dead.

51:01.311 --> 51:04.064
They found her a few
hours ago alone at home.

51:04.521 --> 51:05.898
Heart attack.

51:06.358 --> 51:14.155
At least that's
what they're saying.

51:14.157 --> 51:16.284
Wait, w-what do you mean,
"That's what they're saying?"

51:19.496 --> 51:21.329
What do you think
happened, Mike?

51:27.003 --> 51:29.753
I-I-I don't...
I have no idea.

51:29.755 --> 51:30.713
How would I...?

51:30.715 --> 51:34.300
Your boss,
what does he think?

51:34.302 --> 51:36.052
If you have
questions for Pasha,

51:36.054 --> 51:38.056
you should just
ask him yourself.

51:39.516 --> 51:45.353
Did he ever mention
anything about a list?

51:45.355 --> 51:47.315
No. Why?

51:50.360 --> 51:56.790
Michael, is there anything
you wanna tell me right now?

51:59.327 --> 52:00.370
No.

52:13.090 --> 52:13.967
Thanks.

52:51.503 --> 52:52.338
Hello?

52:52.588 --> 52:53.590
You're home.

52:55.382 --> 52:57.384
Yeah,
yeah I just got in.

52:58.469 --> 53:01.304
Did you hear
about Madame?

53:01.306 --> 53:02.222
Yeah.

53:03.474 --> 53:04.391
Terrible.

53:05.268 --> 53:06.101
Terrible.

53:07.478 --> 53:09.811
We had our
disagreements, but...

53:09.813 --> 53:11.398
This just
breaks my heart.

53:13.818 --> 53:15.111
And, uh...

53:15.402 --> 53:16.528
And the report?

53:17.155 --> 53:18.695
Hassan assures me
that he doesn't share

53:18.697 --> 53:20.865
Madame's determination
to blow up the program.

53:20.867 --> 53:22.407
He'll sign off...

53:22.409 --> 53:25.538
...as her successor, on whatever
we need to get re-funded.

53:26.246 --> 53:27.454
Madame was wrong.

53:27.456 --> 53:28.831
Being fucking dead
doesn't change that.

53:28.833 --> 53:30.874
You've got two days
to clean this up.

53:30.876 --> 53:34.170
What-what do you mean I've
got two days to clean this up?

53:34.172 --> 53:35.713
I've been
thinking I might need you

53:35.715 --> 53:37.423
to present
the oral summary.

53:37.425 --> 53:38.548
Wait.

53:38.550 --> 53:40.885
You want me to
present the report?

53:40.887 --> 53:42.887
To the whole
fucking Security Council.

53:42.889 --> 53:44.847
Isn't that breach
of protocol, Pasha?

53:45.849 --> 53:47.432
I can do what I like.

53:47.434 --> 53:49.434
Besides, they should be
hearing from somebody close

53:49.436 --> 53:52.479
to the ground, and whom
else can I trust to do it?

53:55.275 --> 53:56.652
Okay, yeah.

53:57.945 --> 53:58.779
Hm.

54:17.423 --> 54:18.423
Are you kidding me?

54:18.425 --> 54:19.757
This is such
a big deal.

54:19.759 --> 54:21.592
For somebody at your
pay grade to stand

54:21.594 --> 54:23.885
before
The Security Council?

54:23.887 --> 54:26.516
Yeah, no I know,
it's a great opportunity.

54:27.559 --> 54:28.974
What?

54:28.976 --> 54:30.517
Where did
you get this?

54:30.519 --> 54:32.436
A friend in Baghdad.

54:32.438 --> 54:35.981
Uh no, I mean
I can't crack this.

54:35.983 --> 54:39.526
Do you know
anyone who can?

54:39.528 --> 54:41.364
Do you even know
what's on the drive?

54:43.532 --> 54:45.700
Uh, no.

54:45.702 --> 54:47.746
Do you know anyone
who can crack it?

54:48.413 --> 54:49.746
I'll give it a try.

54:49.748 --> 54:52.498
Do you mind if
I hold onto this?

54:52.500 --> 54:54.083
Yeah, keep it.

54:54.085 --> 54:58.463
Hi, yeah I was given this as a
possible contact number for her.

54:58.465 --> 54:59.923
Yeah, exactly,
Michael Sullivan.

55:03.469 --> 55:04.927
No,
I understand, yeah.

55:04.929 --> 55:07.554
Just the number I gave you,
if you could make sure you

55:07.556 --> 55:09.057
or one of your
colleagues gets, uh,

55:09.059 --> 55:11.601
gets back to me if you
hear anything at all.

55:15.565 --> 55:16.521
Madame Dupre's death

55:16.523 --> 55:18.609
hung over Oil For Food
like a cloud.

55:19.735 --> 55:22.487
But Pasha had a clear
path to what he wanted.

55:27.619 --> 55:32.162
I focused on
writing the report.

55:32.164 --> 55:34.624
I didn't want anyone to
doubt that I deserved

55:34.626 --> 55:36.002
to be in that room.

55:37.836 --> 55:40.630
I couldn't help
thinking about my father.

55:40.632 --> 55:44.175
Whether he had stood before
the council like I would.

55:44.177 --> 55:46.971
Whether he would think that
what I was doing was right.

56:16.001 --> 56:16.835
You okay?

56:17.668 --> 56:19.003
I'm okay now.

57:22.067 --> 57:26.276
They have 100 percent fucking
certainty WMD's in Iraq,

57:26.278 --> 57:28.403
and zero percent
certainty where they are?

57:28.405 --> 57:29.657
Let me call
you back.

57:30.282 --> 57:31.490
Finished.

57:31.492 --> 57:33.494
Pending your review
and Hassan's sign-off.

57:35.163 --> 57:36.664
That's my boy.

57:37.081 --> 57:38.208
Good work.

57:41.960 --> 57:51.177
I got a call from oversight
about your UNLP request

57:51.179 --> 57:53.220
for our sexy
little translator.

57:53.222 --> 57:55.305
They asked me
to look into it.

57:55.307 --> 57:57.516
I believe she's
in New York now.

57:57.518 --> 57:58.477
Right.

57:59.311 --> 58:00.394
She's Kurdish.

58:00.396 --> 58:01.311
She needs asylum.

58:01.313 --> 58:02.688
The D-4 were after her.

58:02.690 --> 58:04.231
They killed two
of her countrymen.

58:04.233 --> 58:06.152
Kurds don't
have a country.

58:18.123 --> 58:20.123
She makes friends
like you everywhere.

58:20.125 --> 58:21.624
Oldest trick
in the book.

58:21.626 --> 58:23.333
The honeypot...

58:23.335 --> 58:25.253
CIA calls it
the "dangle" now.

58:25.255 --> 58:28.213
Seduce the mark,
tell him fairy tales.

58:28.215 --> 58:35.137
It's not the Russians, notice:
CIA, MI5, Interpol...

58:35.139 --> 58:36.555
Girl has
a big following.

58:36.557 --> 58:39.474
Pashmerga sent her to school in
England, got her phony papers

58:39.476 --> 58:43.271
and a job at
The Baghdad UN.

58:43.273 --> 58:45.025
What did she
want you to do?

58:46.775 --> 58:48.150
Nothing.

58:48.152 --> 58:50.445
I bet she's highly
skilled in the soft arts.

58:56.952 --> 58:58.744
What you did is
stupid and illegal.

58:58.746 --> 59:00.037
I'll make it go away.

59:00.039 --> 59:02.206
But in future, if you're
gonna do these things,

59:02.208 --> 59:03.999
you've got to
come to me first.

59:18.391 --> 59:20.057
Who gave you this?

59:20.059 --> 59:21.643
It doesn't matter.

59:23.521 --> 59:25.271
You've been using me.

59:25.273 --> 59:26.396
No.

59:26.398 --> 59:27.775
Yes.

59:29.985 --> 59:33.278
You said you
wanted to help.

59:33.280 --> 59:35.030
Our meeting wasn't
like that, I really...

59:35.032 --> 59:35.990
Fucking bullshit,
Nashim.

59:35.992 --> 59:37.909
I know how
this works.

59:37.911 --> 59:39.202
Do you?

59:39.204 --> 59:40.787
Yeah.

59:40.789 --> 59:43.623
Yes, okay, I am guilty
of taking a job in Baghdad

59:43.625 --> 59:46.626
and trying to find a way
to help my people get free

59:46.628 --> 59:50.088
of a dictator who wants
to exterminate us.

59:50.090 --> 59:53.925
And yes, I talked with men
who might be of help,

59:53.927 --> 59:56.760
but I didn't sleep with
any of them, okay?

59:56.762 --> 59:57.804
I didn't have to.

59:57.806 --> 01:00:02.016
Nashim, you have asked me
to risk my life for a list that

01:00:02.018 --> 01:00:05.353
I don't even know where
the fuck it came from.

01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:06.313
This is...

01:00:12.695 --> 01:00:15.824
I'm sorry,
but this is who I am.

01:00:21.286 --> 01:00:22.830
Do you
want me to leave?

01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:24.724
Hi.

01:01:24.726 --> 01:01:25.974
Hey.

01:01:25.976 --> 01:01:27.309
Came to
wish you luck.

01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:28.978
Hey, man.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.021
Knock 'em dead.

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:31.021
Thank you.

01:01:31.023 --> 01:01:31.938
Michael.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.773
Ready?

01:01:32.775 --> 01:01:33.648
Yeah.

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:34.483
You'll do great.

01:01:34.485 --> 01:01:35.318
Relax.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.321
Thanks.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.240
In an unusual
move at todays United Nations

01:01:42.242 --> 01:01:43.825
Oil For Food vote

01:01:43.827 --> 01:01:47.329
Under-secretary General Costa
Passaris yielded his chair

01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:49.414
to his Executive Assistant,
Michael Sullivan

01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:52.793
to present the report on
the status of the program.

01:01:52.795 --> 01:01:55.796
The uh, Oil For Food program
continues to achieve

01:01:55.798 --> 01:01:58.675
it's core mission of providing
humanitarian relief.

01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:00.967
The request for
continued funding comes in the

01:02:00.969 --> 01:02:03.470
wake of the sudden death of
Baghdad field director,

01:02:03.472 --> 01:02:06.766
Christina Dupre who was a
vocal critic of the program.

01:02:06.768 --> 01:02:09.142
And against the backdrop
of intensified efforts

01:02:09.144 --> 01:02:11.354
to find Saddam Hussein's
suspected caches

01:02:11.356 --> 01:02:13.231
of weapons of
mass destruction.

01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:20.780
Continuing resolution 986, the
council has voted unanimously

01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:25.284
to extend funding for
another 180 days.

01:02:25.286 --> 01:02:27.369
Michael Sullivan
addressed the press after

01:02:27.371 --> 01:02:28.414
The Security
Council vote.

01:02:53.398 --> 01:02:57.733
I don't understand why he
would want to invite me.

01:02:57.735 --> 01:02:59.026
I know.

01:02:59.028 --> 01:02:59.860
Me neither.

01:02:59.862 --> 01:03:00.820
Let's get
a drink, okay?

01:03:00.822 --> 01:03:02.195
Here you are.

01:03:02.197 --> 01:03:03.197
My protégé.

01:03:03.199 --> 01:03:05.657
Michael Sullivan.

01:03:05.659 --> 01:03:07.786
Timur Rasnetsov.

01:03:09.539 --> 01:03:14.624
Costa insists you are
the hero of Oil For Food.

01:03:14.626 --> 01:03:16.670
And here is Nashim.

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:19.046
Lovely.

01:03:19.048 --> 01:03:20.715
Welcome to the USA.

01:03:20.717 --> 01:03:22.717
Thank you.

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:24.052
Where is your drink?

01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:27.514
I think we even have
some Arak tucked away.

01:03:30.851 --> 01:03:31.810
So how
have you been?

01:03:33.646 --> 01:03:35.646
Fine, thank you.

01:03:35.648 --> 01:03:38.775
Great.

01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:40.776
Well, enjoy your evening.

01:03:51.706 --> 01:03:53.873
You must be the young diplomat,
Michael Sullivan

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:56.083
my husband is always
talking about.

01:03:56.085 --> 01:03:57.459
Nice to meet you,
pleasure.

01:03:57.461 --> 01:03:58.878
I'm Melina,
Pasha's wife.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.796
Ah, of course,
yes, yes.

01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:04.883
Pasha gushes about you, and
Pasha doesn't gush about anyone.

01:04:04.885 --> 01:04:07.052
Well he certainly
taught me a lot.

01:04:07.054 --> 01:04:08.847
It can never work.

01:04:10.724 --> 01:04:13.059
Is that a proud papa over
protecting his surrogate son?

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:18.481
Don't patronize me.

01:04:18.483 --> 01:04:21.486
Is it so unthinkable that I
could be in love with him?

01:04:22.945 --> 01:04:24.697
You are what you are.

01:04:27.157 --> 01:04:28.826
You cannot fool me.

01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:33.623
You gave him
the file on me.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.708
Listen.

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:40.503
If you do anything to
compromise the kid or hurt him,

01:04:40.505 --> 01:04:43.758
I will have you deported
so fast your hijab will spin.

01:04:46.135 --> 01:04:49.137
You know what,
I have to um, I have to go.

01:04:49.139 --> 01:04:51.516
My apologies, I have
to deal with something.

01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:55.976
How-how long have
you known that guy for?

01:04:55.978 --> 01:04:58.938
He came with a
delegation, we just met.

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.481
Why?

01:05:00.483 --> 01:05:02.733
He was the one that tried to
bribe me in my hotel in Baghdad.

01:05:02.735 --> 01:05:03.775
Huh.

01:05:03.777 --> 01:05:05.153
Apparently he's
very well connected.

01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:05.987
Could be useful.

01:05:09.992 --> 01:05:11.536
I gotta go.

01:05:11.786 --> 01:05:14.748
What the fuck was that
man doing at the party?

01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:17.667
I don't know.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.003
What did Pasha want?

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:27.008
He threatened me.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.633
Your boss
threatened me.

01:05:33.557 --> 01:05:34.682
Hello?

01:05:34.684 --> 01:05:36.266
Michael, my guy
came through.

01:05:36.268 --> 01:05:38.269
You better
come see this.

01:05:38.271 --> 01:05:40.063
Uh, you're not
gonna believe this.

01:05:40.065 --> 01:05:43.775
Um, Saddam has been selling oil
vouchers at a discount

01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:46.651
to people who turn around,
resell the vouchers

01:05:46.653 --> 01:05:50.072
at the going oil peak rate
for a huge profit.

01:05:50.074 --> 01:05:52.784
Saddam gets a kickback,
a share of the difference

01:05:52.786 --> 01:05:55.244
between his discount
and the going rate.

01:05:55.246 --> 01:05:57.662
How much
did he make?

01:05:57.664 --> 01:06:00.999
Could be over
a billion dollars.

01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:03.043
Jesus Christ.

01:06:03.045 --> 01:06:04.878
Do we know
if these are real?

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.088
They look real.

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:07.923
And it looks
like a system.

01:06:07.925 --> 01:06:10.300
There's a list of
all the major players...

01:06:10.302 --> 01:06:14.054
politicians,
businessmen, bankers,

01:06:14.056 --> 01:06:18.851
we're talking highly-placed
people at the very heart

01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:20.811
of most first
world governments,

01:06:20.813 --> 01:06:23.982
and they are taking millions
of dollars in bribes.

01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:25.108
This is real.

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:26.650
Of course,
it's real.

01:06:26.652 --> 01:06:28.735
Well, to prove it you're
gonna need records

01:06:28.737 --> 01:06:31.113
of the
actual transactions.

01:06:31.115 --> 01:06:32.865
You need to give
this to Pasha.

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:34.200
This is a UN
internal matter.

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:37.244
You do not want to be left
holding the bag on this.

01:06:37.246 --> 01:06:41.916
Amongst the encrypted documents
I found this video codec.

01:06:41.918 --> 01:06:44.043
How long
does it run for?

01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:45.128
71 minutes.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.130
71 minutes is
a strange time.

01:06:47.132 --> 01:06:48.715
I started to
scroll through it,

01:06:48.717 --> 01:06:50.300
but it's all pretty
much the same.

01:06:53.847 --> 01:07:00.059
Zoom in.

01:07:00.061 --> 01:07:01.021
Scroll back.

01:07:28.297 --> 01:07:29.921
I knew it.

01:07:29.923 --> 01:07:31.007
I fuckin' knew it.

01:07:31.009 --> 01:07:32.467
I knew...

01:07:32.469 --> 01:07:34.054
I knew
that he was involved.

01:07:34.304 --> 01:07:36.470
We need to
make the list public.

01:07:36.472 --> 01:07:38.180
We can't do that.

01:07:38.182 --> 01:07:39.264
They'll just deny it.

01:07:39.266 --> 01:07:41.266
And then all we do
is destroy The UN.

01:07:41.268 --> 01:07:44.686
We need to find someone
to start asking questions.

01:07:44.688 --> 01:07:45.979
The media,
your congress.

01:07:45.981 --> 01:07:47.190
The truth
will come out.

01:07:47.192 --> 01:07:48.775
Look, all these powerful
interests at play...

01:07:48.777 --> 01:07:50.776
they will decide
what the truth is.

01:07:50.778 --> 01:07:53.362
Pasha will be the sacrificial
lamb and my career is over.

01:07:53.364 --> 01:07:54.947
You're not
part of this.

01:07:54.949 --> 01:07:56.157
Of course I'm
fucking part of this.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.159
I just gave a speech about
the integrity of Oil For Food.

01:07:58.161 --> 01:07:59.159
What are you saying?

01:07:59.161 --> 01:08:00.119
Do nothing?

01:08:00.121 --> 01:08:01.498
I don't know
what I'm saying.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.185
What's going on?

01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:28.147
Michael! Stop it!

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:29.984
Michael!

01:08:42.453 --> 01:08:43.537
Hey man, you okay?

01:08:43.538 --> 01:08:44.371
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:46.001
You need me
to call 911?

01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:29.291
Where is she?

01:09:29.292 --> 01:09:30.125
I don't know.

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:31.460
Call your friend,

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:33.420
tell him I will trade
what he wants for Nashim.

01:09:33.421 --> 01:09:34.964
He's not my friend.

01:09:34.966 --> 01:09:38.011
Pasha, I have a video of you
taking a fucking bribe from him.

01:09:39.511 --> 01:09:43.305
You gonna come inside kid, or
do we have to do this out here?

01:09:43.307 --> 01:09:46.099
We're gonna
do this out here.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.102
I take a cut, sure.

01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:50.103
Why not?

01:09:50.104 --> 01:09:52.231
Everyone else has.

01:09:52.233 --> 01:09:55.317
I put my whole career
on the line for this mission,

01:09:55.319 --> 01:09:57.237
every fucking day.

01:09:59.323 --> 01:10:01.116
Come inside kid,
it's cold.

01:10:08.832 --> 01:10:11.500
Rasnetsov is a fixer.

01:10:11.502 --> 01:10:14.379
He's a very
dangerous man.

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:19.258
Nothing in Iraq runs,
nothing without him.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.468
And who runs him?

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.260
Highest bidder.

01:10:22.262 --> 01:10:25.723
Moscow, Beijing, Saddam,
Hedge funds, mafia, greed.

01:10:25.725 --> 01:10:30.477
Rasnetsov is the bridge
between politics and reality.

01:10:30.479 --> 01:10:32.272
And whose side
are you on, Pasha?

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.567
Ah, I thought
I heard you come in.

01:10:36.569 --> 01:10:38.238
Sit down
Michael, please.

01:10:40.864 --> 01:10:42.242
I'll make the call.

01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:47.454
Coffee?

01:10:48.372 --> 01:10:49.748
Uh, yeah, thanks.

01:10:55.546 --> 01:10:57.381
Did you enjoy
the party last night?

01:10:57.798 --> 01:10:59.924
Yeah we had a
great time, thank you.

01:10:59.926 --> 01:11:01.384
You left so early.

01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:02.509
I wondered.

01:11:02.511 --> 01:11:03.969
Uh, yeah,
my friend, uh...

01:11:03.971 --> 01:11:05.681
she wasn't
feeling too well.

01:11:08.935 --> 01:11:11.604
It's flu season.

01:11:13.314 --> 01:11:16.566
Yeah.

01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:23.531
Well,
I'll leave you to it.

01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:25.407
They've handed her
over to immigration.

01:11:25.409 --> 01:11:26.911
Okay, well
she has papers.

01:11:27.537 --> 01:11:29.829
I think you'll
find they're missing.

01:11:29.831 --> 01:11:30.912
She's become
an irritation.

01:11:30.914 --> 01:11:32.373
If she gets
deported to Iraq

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.958
they will execute
her for treason.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.919
They'll send her back to Baghdad
where I still have some sway...

01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:38.920
No, you call him
back and tell him

01:11:38.922 --> 01:11:41.924
I'm not gonna give up the list
until Nashim is set free.

01:11:41.926 --> 01:11:43.384
That's not
how it works.

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:44.384
You need
to trust me.

01:11:44.386 --> 01:11:45.635
I did trust
you, Pasha.

01:11:45.637 --> 01:11:49.389
I trusted you and you
fucked me at every turn.

01:11:49.391 --> 01:11:50.767
Look
where we are.

01:11:50.769 --> 01:11:52.059
Committing crimes
and taking bribes.

01:11:52.061 --> 01:11:54.144
The crime would have
been to do nothing.

01:11:54.146 --> 01:11:56.063
To watch
innocents suffer and die.

01:11:56.065 --> 01:11:56.938
What about Dupre?

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:57.982
What about Abhek?

01:11:57.984 --> 01:11:59.400
What was the
justification for that?

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:00.987
We didn't
make the storm.

01:12:01.654 --> 01:12:03.821
And we can't
control the storm.

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:06.741
All we can do is plot
our course, set our sails,

01:12:06.743 --> 01:12:08.576
and try to
do our best.

01:12:08.578 --> 01:12:09.951
As we did,
and we do.

01:12:09.953 --> 01:12:10.995
Best for who, Pasha?

01:12:10.997 --> 01:12:11.954
Best for you.

01:12:11.956 --> 01:12:13.039
Not best for Nashim.

01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:15.040
Not best
for her people.

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:19.795
Ah, look, maybe
you love this spy, fuck.

01:12:19.797 --> 01:12:21.840
Who am I to argue
with the heart?

01:12:25.095 --> 01:12:26.637
Don't let her
get you killed.

01:12:32.769 --> 01:12:36.064
We can help her people,
but we have to do it our way.

01:12:37.106 --> 01:12:40.607
Bush's Coalition of The Willing
is going to Invade Iraq

01:12:40.609 --> 01:12:42.192
in a matter
of days now.

01:12:42.194 --> 01:12:46.656
Consensus is changing, and the
new truth is Saddam is history,

01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:49.701
and Oil For Food can be
successful framework

01:12:49.703 --> 01:12:52.786
for rebuilding of a new
free Iraq

01:12:52.788 --> 01:12:54.998
in which
The United Nations,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.583
not the carpetbaggers
and craven governments

01:12:57.585 --> 01:12:58.710
who created
this nightmare...

01:12:58.712 --> 01:13:00.797
The UN can take
the lead fucking role.

01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:03.590
You and me, kid.

01:13:06.094 --> 01:13:09.931
We can save the world
and save your girl.

01:13:16.604 --> 01:13:17.814
Trust me.

01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:26.653
My fellow citizens, at this hour
American in Coalition forces

01:13:26.655 --> 01:13:29.115
are in the early stages
of military operations

01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:31.867
to disarm Iraq,
to free it's people

01:13:31.869 --> 01:13:34.163
and to defend
the world from grave danger.

01:13:38.335 --> 01:13:43.045
Over the next 24 to 48
hours perhaps as many as 3000.

01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:46.132
3000 tomahawk
cruise missiles,

01:13:46.134 --> 01:13:48.634
satellite guided
precision bombs,

01:13:48.636 --> 01:13:51.763
laser guided bombs would
be dropped on various targets.

01:13:51.765 --> 01:13:53.723
Not only in Baghdad...

01:13:53.725 --> 01:13:56.644
among Baghdad, but
elsewhere around the...

01:14:04.109 --> 01:14:07.778
Six weeks after the
invasion I was back in Baghdad

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.865
to work on Pasha's
plan to put The UN in charge of

01:14:10.867 --> 01:14:13.742
rebuilding
the new Iraq.

01:14:13.744 --> 01:14:15.160
The sanctions
were lifted.

01:14:15.162 --> 01:14:17.746
The free market
would power the country.

01:14:17.748 --> 01:14:20.290
Free elections would give
every citizen a voice,

01:14:20.292 --> 01:14:21.877
and oil would
pay the bills.

01:14:24.506 --> 01:14:27.799
Pasha still had
strong connections.

01:14:27.801 --> 01:14:29.678
And he kept
his promise to me.

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:37.685
Nashim Husseini.

01:15:28.819 --> 01:15:30.738
It's nice when
we're together.

01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:33.408
Blank pages.

01:15:40.582 --> 01:15:42.042
I missed you.

01:15:49.466 --> 01:15:51.176
I have
something for you.

01:15:56.430 --> 01:16:02.768
A new passport
and a visa so here.

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:04.773
You can stay as
long as you want.

01:16:07.192 --> 01:16:08.859
And what
about the list?

01:16:12.197 --> 01:16:13.782
I gave it to Pasha.

01:16:17.452 --> 01:16:20.035
You traded
the list for me?

01:16:20.037 --> 01:16:20.911
Yeah.

01:16:20.913 --> 01:16:21.870
Why?

01:16:21.872 --> 01:16:22.996
I didn't exactly
have a choice.

01:16:22.998 --> 01:16:24.706
I made a
judgment call, okay?

01:16:24.708 --> 01:16:28.251
And what do you think is
going to happen with Pasha now?

01:16:28.253 --> 01:16:31.048
Pasha can still do a
lot of good in The UN.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.757
You are dreaming.

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:33.924
I'm not dreaming.

01:16:33.926 --> 01:16:35.425
I'm not dreaming,
I'm not, okay?

01:16:35.427 --> 01:16:37.344
Consensus has changed,
and with Saddam gone

01:16:37.346 --> 01:16:39.347
we can actually
do a lot of good.

01:16:39.349 --> 01:16:40.682
Finally...

01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:41.848
Just by thinking you
can work with the criminals

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:45.812
to take what you
want you are lost.

01:16:45.814 --> 01:16:48.815
Well, it wasn't exactly a
fight we were gonna win, was it?

01:16:48.817 --> 01:16:52.442
I put all my
fucking life on this.

01:16:52.444 --> 01:16:55.237
Who are you to
decide that for me?

01:16:55.239 --> 01:16:56.573
You said it yourself.

01:16:58.158 --> 01:17:00.953
It's very, very
fucking complicated.

01:17:03.456 --> 01:17:06.126
No,
not this part.

01:17:08.043 --> 01:17:11.963
This part
is very simple.

01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:14.050
I don't wanna
be a part of this.

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:16.800
I can't.

01:17:16.802 --> 01:17:19.305
Nashim, Nashim,
wait, wait, wait.

01:17:21.474 --> 01:17:22.851
Nashim!

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:38.531
I'm told you aren't
answering your phone.

01:17:38.533 --> 01:17:40.201
What the fuck?

01:17:41.578 --> 01:17:42.701
Yeah, I've been busy.

01:17:42.703 --> 01:17:49.083
Yeah.

01:17:49.085 --> 01:17:50.295
I heard.

01:17:51.212 --> 01:17:53.170
Your Kurd
took a walk.

01:17:53.172 --> 01:17:56.134
Relationships are
a train wreck.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.719
Come on, kid.

01:18:00.721 --> 01:18:02.597
You wanted a
career in diplomacy.

01:18:02.599 --> 01:18:08.311
Well, you're missing
your golden moment.

01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:09.898
See you
at the office.

01:18:28.332 --> 01:18:30.585
Pasha I have those medical
contracts for you to...

01:18:35.465 --> 01:18:37.132
I was on
my way out.

01:18:38.217 --> 01:18:39.759
Pasha.

01:18:39.761 --> 01:18:40.720
Abiento.

01:18:48.603 --> 01:18:50.730
It's good to see
you again, Michael.

01:18:58.154 --> 01:18:59.489
You think I like it?

01:19:00.448 --> 01:19:02.490
He's got the world
in his pocket, kid.

01:19:02.492 --> 01:19:04.659
All the major fucking
players in the reconstruction.

01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:05.660
I don't understand.

01:19:05.662 --> 01:19:07.285
When did he
get back into this?

01:19:07.287 --> 01:19:09.580
He never left, he just
moved into the shadows,

01:19:09.582 --> 01:19:11.209
as the stakes
got higher.

01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:13.291
There's no one else.

01:19:13.293 --> 01:19:14.753
We've been
through this, Michael.

01:19:17.798 --> 01:19:19.591
I'm not gonna
fucking deal with him.

01:19:22.302 --> 01:19:23.430
What?

01:19:27.516 --> 01:19:28.933
This is
how it works.

01:19:36.067 --> 01:19:39.317
The optimism of
liberation was short lived.

01:19:39.319 --> 01:19:41.486
It turned out nobody
had made plans for

01:19:41.488 --> 01:19:44.197
what to do after
Saddam was gone.

01:19:44.199 --> 01:19:45.866
The Americans
had purged everyone

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:48.076
who had been loyal
to the regime,

01:19:48.078 --> 01:19:49.704
which meant there
wasn't anybody left

01:19:49.706 --> 01:19:51.458
who knew how
to run the country.

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:55.876
Renetsov and all the other
fixtures like him filled

01:19:55.878 --> 01:20:00.048
that vacuum of power, and out
to control the game again.

01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:03.884
Iraq spiraled into
anarchy, chaos, and terror.

01:20:09.641 --> 01:20:10.892
All those
countries that had been

01:20:10.894 --> 01:20:14.437
scamming Oil For Food
before the war,

01:20:14.439 --> 01:20:17.272
well, they got ready
to carve Iraq up.

01:20:19.069 --> 01:20:22.320
Like it was
one big pie.

01:20:22.322 --> 01:20:23.364
And me?

01:20:24.282 --> 01:20:27.532
I was going
through the motions.

01:20:27.534 --> 01:20:28.951
I'd lost
my faith in it.

01:20:44.886 --> 01:20:46.052
Hello?

01:20:46.054 --> 01:20:47.471
It's Nashim.

01:20:49.099 --> 01:20:49.974
Hey.

01:20:51.975 --> 01:20:52.933
You okay?

01:20:52.935 --> 01:20:54.352
I need to see you.

01:20:54.354 --> 01:20:55.689
Can you
come downstairs?

01:20:57.690 --> 01:20:58.692
Sure.

01:21:11.121 --> 01:21:13.537
Michael,
good to see you.

01:21:13.539 --> 01:21:14.416
Yeah.

01:21:15.082 --> 01:21:17.959
I got someone
you gotta meet.

01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:19.742
We need
your help, Michael.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.804
Michael Sullivan,
Mr. Shaswar Rauf.

01:21:30.806 --> 01:21:32.098
Yeah,
we met before.

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:36.936
He will play a
central role in a New Iraq.

01:21:36.938 --> 01:21:39.606
You ever heard of a
guy named Resnetsov?

01:21:40.984 --> 01:21:42.107
Yeah.

01:21:42.109 --> 01:21:44.110
Yeah?
You ever met him?

01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:46.573
A few times, uh,
before the invasion.

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.742
How 'bout after?

01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:52.996
No I didn't.

01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:57.790
Well now him and his criminal
gang from Oil For Food are back,

01:21:57.792 --> 01:21:59.753
and they're
creating a mess in Iraq.

01:22:01.796 --> 01:22:02.672
Yeah.

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:10.553
You know there was a list
of, uh, individuals and

01:22:10.555 --> 01:22:13.973
organizations that were helping
Saddam fleece Oil For Food.

01:22:13.975 --> 01:22:15.808
You guys know
about that, don't you?

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:18.811
Yeah, but there was no way
to prove what was on it.

01:22:18.813 --> 01:22:21.565
No, proof was in
the Iraq Oil Ministry.

01:22:22.108 --> 01:22:24.192
Official files that were
taken by the US troops

01:22:24.194 --> 01:22:26.110
after the
government fell.

01:22:26.112 --> 01:22:29.280
Proof that is probably still in
the basement of the UN

01:22:29.282 --> 01:22:31.991
somewhere if anyone
cared to look.

01:22:31.993 --> 01:22:33.241
Look,
forget about the list.

01:22:33.243 --> 01:22:35.119
We don't want
the list anymore.

01:22:35.121 --> 01:22:36.161
You don't want the list.

01:22:36.163 --> 01:22:37.205
Too many
powerful people.

01:22:37.207 --> 01:22:39.206
Too political.

01:22:39.208 --> 01:22:41.084
It's a coalition of
the fucking greedy.

01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:42.921
No one gives
a shit about Iraq.

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:45.879
Everyone just wants
the money and the crude.

01:22:45.881 --> 01:22:48.967
Yeah, and that's why
we need to stop Resnetsov.

01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:52.596
And Pasha can
give him to us.

01:22:54.265 --> 01:22:57.894
Michael we have strong Intel
that your boss is involved.

01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:01.646
Pasha's never
gonna help you.

01:23:01.648 --> 01:23:03.942
Well maybe he just
needs a little push.

01:23:05.902 --> 01:23:08.820
And we're hoping that
maybe you can convince him.

01:23:08.822 --> 01:23:10.321
You think I can
convince Pasha?

01:23:10.323 --> 01:23:13.199
Pasha's never gonna do it,
he's never gonna listen to you.

01:23:13.201 --> 01:23:20.248
We can protect the UN
from any unpleasant blow-back.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.208
Diplomacy.

01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:23.084
What?

01:23:23.086 --> 01:23:28.714
Diplomacy.

01:23:28.716 --> 01:23:30.090
Something Pasha
said to me once.

01:23:57.453 --> 01:23:59.956
So now you're the one
working with the criminals.

01:24:01.957 --> 01:24:03.999
It's not the same.

01:24:06.087 --> 01:24:07.172
Why isn't
it the same?

01:24:08.088 --> 01:24:09.921
We have the
momentum now.

01:24:09.923 --> 01:24:12.467
The Kurds are going to be an
important part of making...

01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:14.802
Kurds have been
fighting the same war

01:24:14.804 --> 01:24:16.178
for pretty
much 7000 years.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.265
You really think this is
gonna change anything?

01:24:20.894 --> 01:24:23.311
Who can say?

01:24:23.313 --> 01:24:26.274
But for sure it's not up to
you to decide that for us.

01:24:28.902 --> 01:24:29.735
Come with me.

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:40.327
I can't.

01:25:15.948 --> 01:25:17.241
Neonatal medicine.

01:25:18.158 --> 01:25:19.659
Yeah, they're
new vendors.

01:25:19.661 --> 01:25:21.078
French Canadians.

01:25:22.079 --> 01:25:23.161
They want
exclusive rights

01:25:23.163 --> 01:25:24.955
to the whole of
The Northern Region.

01:25:24.957 --> 01:25:27.541
That's fairly greedy,
especially for the Canadian's.

01:25:27.543 --> 01:25:28.543
Well I can...

01:25:28.545 --> 01:25:30.378
They'll need to be
willing to pay

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:32.421
a hundred grand
to make it happen.

01:25:32.423 --> 01:25:35.049
You, um,
do the legwork

01:25:35.051 --> 01:25:37.218
with the Kurds and the
Provisional Authority,

01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.472
I'll handle the
rat, we split fifty-fifty.

01:25:40.097 --> 01:25:41.347
Fifty thousand dollar
pay off?

01:25:41.349 --> 01:25:44.392
No, shekels.

01:25:44.394 --> 01:25:45.351
Christ,
of course dollars.

01:25:45.353 --> 01:25:47.186
What the fuck?

01:25:47.188 --> 01:25:48.398
Thank you.

01:25:50.649 --> 01:25:53.233
Pleasure to see
you again, sir.

01:25:53.235 --> 01:25:56.278
And so much more
favorable circumstances.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.573
Yes?

01:25:58.783 --> 01:26:01.325
Ah, you must be one
of the Canadians.

01:26:01.327 --> 01:26:02.451
Uh, Cutter, sir.

01:26:02.453 --> 01:26:03.369
No.

01:26:03.371 --> 01:26:05.370
Ah, American.

01:26:05.372 --> 01:26:07.000
I wasn't, um...

01:26:07.583 --> 01:26:09.375
you didn't tell me the
Provisional Authorities

01:26:09.377 --> 01:26:12.128
would be sending someone
for such a routine agreement.

01:26:12.130 --> 01:26:13.545
They didn't.

01:26:13.547 --> 01:26:18.092
We're not exactly here
about medicine, Mr. Passaris.

01:26:19.304 --> 01:26:23.222
They'll need to be willing
to pay a hundred grand

01:26:23.224 --> 01:26:24.184
to make it happen.

01:26:24.641 --> 01:26:28.268
You, um, do the
legwork with the Kurds

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:30.729
and the Provisional Authority,
I'll handle the rat,

01:26:30.731 --> 01:26:33.482
we'll split fifty-fifty.

01:26:33.484 --> 01:26:35.401
Oh, kid.

01:26:35.403 --> 01:26:36.611
Fifty thousand
dollar pay off?

01:26:36.613 --> 01:26:39.280
No, shekels.

01:26:39.282 --> 01:26:40.490
Christ,
of course dollars.

01:26:40.492 --> 01:26:42.034
What the fuck?

01:26:45.829 --> 01:26:48.291
It's like a surprise
party without the cake.

01:26:51.377 --> 01:26:52.545
What do you want?

01:26:53.462 --> 01:26:56.171
Give us Timur
Rasnetsov, and resign your job.

01:26:57.425 --> 01:27:00.175
Or we'll have to drag you
and the United Nations

01:27:00.177 --> 01:27:02.764
through a scandal
of historic proportion.

01:27:06.935 --> 01:27:11.687
This happens with or
without you, with or without me.

01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:15.357
Rasnetsov is protected by
multinational companies

01:27:15.359 --> 01:27:16.651
who have governments
who protect them...

01:27:16.653 --> 01:27:18.902
same people who just
brought Saddam to his knees

01:27:18.904 --> 01:27:20.780
and put you here...

01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:22.906
holding court,
judging me.

01:27:22.908 --> 01:27:25.660
You think your place at the
table now was not bought

01:27:25.662 --> 01:27:26.660
and paid for?

01:27:26.662 --> 01:27:27.911
We paid
with our lives.

01:27:27.913 --> 01:27:29.080
If that's
what you mean.

01:27:29.082 --> 01:27:31.456
What you call corruption is
simply the growing pains

01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:36.294
of a new democracy.

01:27:36.296 --> 01:27:37.588
And you
are indeed fools

01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:41.509
if you think you can put
the brakes on it now.

01:27:41.511 --> 01:27:44.344
Let's let the
politicians worry about that.

01:27:44.346 --> 01:27:46.474
We will
settle for the rat.

01:27:46.765 --> 01:27:49.392
You want me
to commit suicide.

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:50.684
We can protect you.

01:27:50.686 --> 01:27:51.977
You know
that's not true.

01:27:51.979 --> 01:27:53.480
Well, just set up
a meeting.

01:27:54.524 --> 01:27:56.609
Give him the envelope
for the Canadian deal.

01:27:57.402 --> 01:28:04.824
We'll catch
him red-handed.

01:28:04.826 --> 01:28:05.827
What the hell?

01:28:44.783 --> 01:28:45.825
Not bad, kid.

01:28:47.534 --> 01:28:48.951
Well played.

01:28:59.838 --> 01:29:00.673
He's late.

01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:04.861
Yes?

01:30:29.636 --> 01:30:31.180
Fucking country.

01:31:35.537 --> 01:31:38.123
Is it okay
if I join you?

01:31:42.252 --> 01:31:44.335
I'll be stepping
down, going home.

01:31:44.337 --> 01:31:45.839
I've lost
my taste for it.

01:31:46.338 --> 01:31:48.382
I wanted you to
hear it from me.

01:31:49.717 --> 01:31:52.345
I've recommended you
for a position in UNESCO.

01:31:53.012 --> 01:31:54.514
Special Assistant.

01:31:55.974 --> 01:31:58.393
You'll be the youngest
one in the whole UN.

01:32:01.479 --> 01:32:02.480
Did you know?

01:32:04.733 --> 01:32:05.859
Oh kid.

01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:11.780
How can even
you think that?

01:32:13.449 --> 01:32:16.368
These fucking lunatics, they're
killing each other every day.

01:32:18.747 --> 01:32:20.164
That's the
truth of it.

01:32:23.667 --> 01:32:25.377
That's your
truth, Pasha.

01:32:27.796 --> 01:32:30.173
And I'm not
part of it anymore.

01:32:31.509 --> 01:32:32.799
Don't.

01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:34.384
Don't do
anything dumb.

01:32:34.386 --> 01:32:36.094
You can't
fight the storm.

01:32:49.985 --> 01:32:52.322
I realized everybody
knew about the corruption.

01:32:53.614 --> 01:32:55.199
They just didn't
want it exposed.

01:32:56.618 --> 01:32:58.785
Every permanent member
of The Security Council

01:32:58.787 --> 01:33:01.495
had something to lose,
someone on the list

01:33:01.497 --> 01:33:03.082
who could
embarrass them.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.541
It would all
be covered up.

01:33:06.543 --> 01:33:08.671
But the UN couldn't
survive these lies.

01:33:10.923 --> 01:33:12.714
I had to
do something.

01:33:12.716 --> 01:33:16.011
Risk something
to make a change.

01:33:17.221 --> 01:33:18.595
If I tried to list

01:33:18.597 --> 01:33:22.433
his accomplishments
we would be here into tomorrow,

01:33:22.435 --> 01:33:25.769
but in his forty years
of service to the cause

01:33:25.771 --> 01:33:28.690
of world peace and our
humanitarian mission,

01:33:28.692 --> 01:33:31.025
the crowning achievement
would have to be

01:33:31.027 --> 01:33:33.945
his successful implementation
and operation

01:33:33.947 --> 01:33:35.530
of Oil For Food.

01:33:43.581 --> 01:33:45.455
Hi. I'm Trevor Owen
from Oversight.

01:33:45.457 --> 01:33:47.250
I spoke to
John earlier.

01:33:47.252 --> 01:33:48.668
Saddam's Palace Files.

01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:50.503
Right, yeah.

01:33:50.505 --> 01:33:51.754
Which boxes?

01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:53.339
All of them.

01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:55.340
They're sealed to the public,
but as you're from oversight,

01:33:55.342 --> 01:33:58.052
and as long as you don't take
anything with you...

01:33:58.054 --> 01:33:59.055
...go crazy.

01:33:59.514 --> 01:34:00.390
Thank you.

01:34:01.349 --> 01:34:02.932
Mr. Passaris.

01:34:02.934 --> 01:34:04.017
Job well done.

01:34:04.019 --> 01:34:04.933
Thank you.

01:34:06.979 --> 01:34:07.894
Where's Michael?

01:34:07.896 --> 01:34:09.399
He's cleared
his desk, sir.

01:34:12.819 --> 01:34:14.279
I think I found it.

01:34:16.823 --> 01:34:19.281
You know what we're
gonna have to do?

01:34:19.283 --> 01:34:20.616
Fuckin' family.

01:34:58.739 --> 01:35:01.366
My name
is Michael Sullivan,

01:35:01.368 --> 01:35:08.580
and I have a story I think
you're gonna wanna hear.

01:35:08.582 --> 01:35:11.334
These are the raw numbers for
how much money was involved,

01:35:11.336 --> 01:35:14.670
and that is billions,
not millions.

01:35:14.672 --> 01:35:17.298
Jesus.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:20.802
And this is a list of everyone
who received vouchers there,

01:35:20.804 --> 01:35:21.721
bribes and kickbacks.

01:35:22.846 --> 01:35:26.348
You can corroborate the names
with the deposit records

01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:29.186
right here with the list
of contracts on file.

01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:35.734
This is massive,
Jesse.

01:35:37.695 --> 01:35:39.653
You realize the minute
this breaks

01:35:39.655 --> 01:35:42.031
you'll have
a lot of enemies.

01:35:42.033 --> 01:35:43.243
Yeah, I know.

01:35:43.827 --> 01:35:45.492
We, uh,
we could protect you,

01:35:45.494 --> 01:35:47.495
cite you as a
confidential source.

01:35:47.497 --> 01:35:49.414
No, anonymity is
part of the problem.

01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:52.000
If nobody takes
responsibility for the truth

01:35:52.002 --> 01:35:54.087
then we are leaving it
up to consensus

01:35:55.838 --> 01:35:57.256
I have to own it.

01:35:59.801 --> 01:36:02.009
We begin this evening
with the United Nations,

01:36:02.011 --> 01:36:05.638
the Oil For Food controversy,
and scandal.

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:08.391
And the call on the part of
the United States senator

01:36:08.393 --> 01:36:11.268
for the resignation
of Kofi Annan.

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:14.062
Obviously these
are serious allegations,

01:36:14.064 --> 01:36:15.063
which we
take seriously.

01:36:15.065 --> 01:36:19.027
The UN secretary general
today ordered an investigation

01:36:19.029 --> 01:36:20.611
of Costa Passaris.

01:36:20.613 --> 01:36:23.947
The former undersecretary
who a whistleblower claims

01:36:23.949 --> 01:36:26.616
was behind the Oil For Food
scandal that has rocked

01:36:26.618 --> 01:36:29.911
the United Nations,
and implicated a long list

01:36:29.913 --> 01:36:32.874
of prominent businessmen,
and political figures

01:36:32.876 --> 01:36:35.084
across the world.

01:36:35.086 --> 01:36:36.796
Incompetent
and corrupt.

01:36:41.091 --> 01:36:43.425
Weaknesses in the Oil For Food
program raises

01:36:43.427 --> 01:36:45.428
serious questions about
the United Nations'

01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:47.722
ability to enforce
sanctions and administer

01:36:47.724 --> 01:36:49.723
a humanitarian aid
program in the future.

01:36:49.725 --> 01:36:51.851
The documents The Telegraph
have come up with

01:36:51.853 --> 01:36:54.353
were reportedly found
in Iraq's foreign Ministry

01:36:54.355 --> 01:36:57.440
in the anarchic
days after the US lead invasion.

01:36:57.442 --> 01:37:00.485
The Wall Street Journal
reports having documentation

01:37:00.487 --> 01:37:02.527
of kickbacks and
bribes in the form

01:37:02.529 --> 01:37:05.865
of oil vouchers
worth billions of dollars.

01:37:05.867 --> 01:37:07.866
But according to
federal authorities,

01:37:07.868 --> 01:37:10.662
Passaris himself
has fled the country.

01:37:33.978 --> 01:37:35.855
I'm with The Wall
Street Journal.

01:37:37.106 --> 01:37:40.942
We're doing a follow up on
the Oil For Food scandal.

01:37:40.944 --> 01:37:43.613
I've come to
get your side of the story.

01:37:43.947 --> 01:37:44.948
I don't
have a side.

01:37:45.573 --> 01:37:46.908
And it's the
kid's fucking story.

01:37:56.751 --> 01:37:58.086
I'm not
running away, okay?

01:37:58.795 --> 01:38:00.419
Make sure
you write that.

01:38:00.421 --> 01:38:03.005
Not hiding
from anybody.

01:38:03.007 --> 01:38:05.799
And yet here you are in
a place without extradition.

01:38:05.801 --> 01:38:07.509
It was difficult.

01:38:07.511 --> 01:38:09.803
Write that.

01:38:09.805 --> 01:38:12.139
Complicated.

01:38:12.141 --> 01:38:14.142
Messy with
Saddam's ugly nonsense

01:38:14.144 --> 01:38:15.727
and the usual
first world duplicity,

01:38:15.729 --> 01:38:17.521
but we
did more good than bad.

01:38:21.734 --> 01:38:23.652
I don't care what
anybody fucking says.

01:38:27.782 --> 01:38:29.617
And the
kid did great.

01:38:34.163 --> 01:38:38.460
The choice as I see it
is between cynicism and candor.

01:38:39.002 --> 01:38:42.128
You know if everyone cared so
much about Iraq as they said,

01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:45.548
then this story would
have been celebrated

01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:47.594
as a conspiracy
of saints.

01:38:49.845 --> 01:38:51.138
But the truth...

01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:56.853
the truth isn't about
the lies we told each other.

01:38:59.689 --> 01:39:01.272
It's about the lies
we told ourselves.

01:39:10.158 --> 01:39:11.907
More than
two thousand companies

01:39:11.909 --> 01:39:14.160
from fifty-six different
countries took bribes

01:39:14.162 --> 01:39:16.581
or paid kickbacks
to Saddam Hussein.

01:39:18.123 --> 01:39:20.208
Over twenty billion dollars
got diverted

01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:22.210
from the
Oil For Food Program.

01:39:22.212 --> 01:39:23.919
Implicated were
some of the most

01:39:23.921 --> 01:39:28.049
prestigious corporations
in the world.

01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:31.218
One hundred and seventy two
organizations and individuals

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:34.598
highly placed in their
governments received bribes.

01:39:37.726 --> 01:39:40.143
My name is
Michael Sullivan.

01:39:40.145 --> 01:39:41.605
My father
was a diplomat.

01:39:43.899 --> 01:39:46.692
I tried to follow
in his footsteps.
