WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.698
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.134
MCCREARY: HOW THE HELL
DID YOU GET HERE?

00:04.178 --> 00:05.788
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?

00:05.831 --> 00:07.050
6 DAYS, MAYBE 7.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.183
LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE'RE ON HIS SIDE.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.098
HOW CAN YOU STILL BE
AGAINST OCTAVIA?

00:11.141 --> 00:14.623
SHE MURDERED HER OWN PEOPLE
TO BREAK THEIR WILL.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.060
IF THIS IS THE LAST
LIVING VALLEY ON EARTH,

00:17.104 --> 00:18.322
THEN IT SHOULD BE OURS.

00:18.366 --> 00:21.238
BELLAMY: THEIR WHOLE FOCUS
IS TO KEEP YOU OUT.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.327
WHEN I GIVE THE SIGNAL,
WE OPEN FIRE

00:23.371 --> 00:25.721
ON PILLBOX ONE,
POSITION "A" HERE.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.244
ACCORDING TO DIYOZA,
AT THE FIRST SIGN...

00:27.288 --> 00:29.290
BELLAMY: ...OF ATTACK,
MCCREARY'S FORCES AT POINT "B"

00:29.333 --> 00:31.466
AND "C" WILL CONVERGE
TO REINFORCE "A,"

00:31.509 --> 00:33.033
THINKING THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE COMING THROUGH.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.947
OCTAVIA: LEAVING THE OTHER
TWO DOORS WIDE OPEN.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.646
WE TIME IT RIGHT, WE MOVE FAST,
THERE WON'T BE ANY RESISTANCE.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.126
YOU HAVE TWO
SECONDS TO TELL ME

00:39.169 --> 00:40.823
WHY YOU'RE TURNING
YOURSELVES IN.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.781
WONKRU KNOW YOU
HAVE MY BATTLE PLANS.

00:42.825 --> 00:45.175
THEY KNOW EVERY MOVE YOU'RE
GONNA MAKE BEFORE YOU MAKE IT.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.524
KANE: YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE THIS WAR.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.048
WE'LL TELL YOU
HOW TO WIN IT.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.571
AND WHY WOULD
YOU TELL ME THAT?

00:49.614 --> 00:54.619
BECAUSE I WON'T LET
THE DEVIL IN THIS GARDEN.

01:15.379 --> 01:21.037
BELLAMY: TWO PILLBOXES,
JUST LIKE ECHO SAID.

01:22.430 --> 01:25.302
THAT'S OUR SIGNAL.

01:44.278 --> 01:47.281
LEAVE IT. LET'S GO.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.153
BELLAMY: IT'S WORKING.
THEY'RE MOVING OUT.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.521
MCCREARY, ON RADIO: "A" TEAM,
CEASE FIRE. DOG IS IN.

02:10.565 --> 02:13.742
MOVE TO POSITION "B"
AND JOIN IN ON THE FUN.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.877
RAVEN: MURPHY, YOU FINALLY
GOT A GUN. USE IT.

02:18.921 --> 02:22.229
MURPHY: GOING AS FAST
AS I CAN. COME ON!

02:24.013 --> 02:25.232
SHOULD STAY.

02:26.581 --> 02:30.019
SAY HELLO
TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!

02:30.062 --> 02:32.239
OH, SHE'S GOT A KICK.

02:32.282 --> 02:33.327
JOHN.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.069
WHAT DID YOU DO?

02:37.113 --> 02:39.289
SHAW: HE CRACKED THE CORE.
IT'S GONNA BLOW. WE SHOULD RUN.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.821
I DON'T RUN.

02:49.865 --> 02:53.042
ECHO: THEY'VE STOPPED
SHOOTING BACK.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.530
NO MOVEMENT
IN THE PILLBOXES.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.532
RAVEN: NO REINFORCEMENTS
YET, EITHER.

03:04.575 --> 03:07.056
WHERE THE HELL
IS EVERYONE, THEN?

03:09.363 --> 03:11.582
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.410
MCCREARY: DO ME A FAVOR, KUBA.

03:13.454 --> 03:15.499
LEAVE THE MIC OPEN
TILL IT'S DONE

03:15.543 --> 03:17.501
SO WE CAN HEAR THE MUSIC.

03:31.689 --> 03:35.258
YOU DID YOUR BEST
TO STOP THIS.

03:35.302 --> 03:38.087
IN THE END, IF WE
HAVE TO FIGHT,

03:38.130 --> 03:40.132
IT'S BETTER TO WIN.

03:49.577 --> 03:52.884
JAHA WOULD BE
PROUD OF YOU, ETHAN.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.060
UH!

03:59.891 --> 04:01.241
ATTACK!

04:01.284 --> 04:03.852
O., YOU SHOULD
BE COVERED.

04:12.382 --> 04:15.472
STAY LOW!
STAND YOUR GROUND.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.127
OH!

04:21.696 --> 04:25.874
BRELL: RETREAT!
GO BACK TO THE BUNKER!

04:25.917 --> 04:29.573
OCTAVIA: NO! ADVANCE!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY!

04:29.617 --> 04:33.316
O.! O., IT'S
THE ONLY WAY.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.361
GET OUT OF HERE.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.406
WE GO BACK,
OR WE FIND ANOTHER--

04:39.191 --> 04:42.412
AAH!

05:21.233 --> 05:23.584
KUBA, ON RADIO: WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THE ONES WHO GOT AWAY?

05:23.627 --> 05:25.150
LET THEM RUN.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.502
THEY'LL DIE OF STARVATION
IN THE WASTELAND.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.417
KUBA: COPY THAT.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.900
WHAT'S WRONG, KANE?

05:35.944 --> 05:39.730
I THOUGHT THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANTED, TOO.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.516
WE ALL WANT
THE SAME THING--

05:42.559 --> 05:44.953
THE SURVIVAL OF
THE HUMAN RACE,

05:44.996 --> 05:46.563
AND THERE ARE
PEOPLE OUT THERE

05:46.607 --> 05:48.173
WHO CAN HELP US
ACHIEVE THAT.

05:48.217 --> 05:51.612
HE'S RIGHT.
WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

05:51.655 --> 05:55.224
MCCREARY: AND YET,
ACCORDING TO YOUR BOOK,

05:55.267 --> 05:57.705
WE HAVE EVERYTHING
WE NEED RIGHT HERE.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.492
IT'S YOUR FIRST ENTRY
AFTER WE WOKE UP

06:02.536 --> 06:04.625
AND WE THOUGHT
WE WERE ALONE,

06:04.668 --> 06:06.714
RIGHT AFTER YOUR SWORD
OF DAMOCLES SPEECH

06:06.757 --> 06:10.065
TO THE LEADERS OF
THE SO-CALLED FREE WORLD.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.154
WE DIDN'T NEED
THAT ONE, DID WE,

06:12.197 --> 06:14.983
AND HERE IT IS--
PLANS FOR THE SURVIVAL

06:15.026 --> 06:17.681
OF THE SPECIES,
COURTESY OF OUR FRIENDS

06:17.725 --> 06:19.596
ABOARD
ELIGIUS THREE.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.598
THEY WEREN'T
CRIMINALS.

06:21.642 --> 06:24.688
NEITHER ARE WE,
NOT ANYMORE.

06:24.732 --> 06:27.038
YOU WILL BE IF YOU
COMMIT GENOCIDE.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.737
AND I THOUGHT WE
WERE ALL FRIENDS NOW.

06:29.780 --> 06:34.524
RELAX, PAXTON.
WE ARE.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.134
IT WAS ALWAYS GONNA
BE US OR THEM.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.659
KANE KNOWS THAT, TOO,
DON'T YOU, KANE?

06:38.702 --> 06:41.705
SHE'S GOOD, ISN'T SHE?

06:45.405 --> 06:49.757
THESE IS ONLY ONE REASON
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE,

06:49.800 --> 06:55.502
AND ONCE SHE'S BORN,
YOU WON'T BE.

06:56.807 --> 07:00.202
-LOCK HER UP.
-YES, SIR.

07:00.245 --> 07:03.814
LOOK. WE GAVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANTED.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.295
OUR INTEL WAS GOOD,

07:06.338 --> 07:09.646
AND IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO SEE ABBY NOW.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.475
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE
REASON YOU'RE STILL ALIVE,

07:12.519 --> 07:14.216
AND I DO MIND.

07:15.826 --> 07:18.350
YOU CAN SEE HER
ONCE SHE'S FINISHED

07:18.394 --> 07:21.310
HEALING MY MEN AND
EXAMINING MY CHILD.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.616
UNTIL THEN...

07:22.659 --> 07:26.750
WHY DON'T WE LISTEN TO
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, KANE?

07:31.755 --> 07:34.932
THAT IS THE SOUND
OF VICTORY.

07:53.647 --> 07:54.952
OCTAVIA WOULD
HAVE KILLED US.

07:54.996 --> 07:58.652
CLARKE, THEY'RE
GETTING SLAUGHTERED.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.784
WE MADE OUR CHOICE.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.657
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.442
ABBY: LET'S DO THIS.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.537
CLARKE: LAST PATIENT.
YOU DID GOOD, MOM.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.235
AFTER THIS, I WANT YOU TO REST.
MADI AND I WILL CLEAN UP.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.890
AFTER THIS,
IT'LL GET EASIER.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.110
I NEED IT
TO GET EASIER.

08:25.287 --> 08:28.812
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO ASK.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.858
THE OVERDOSE.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.691
WAS IT AN ACCIDENT?

08:37.734 --> 08:40.432
I DON'T KNOW.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.656
WELL, WE'RE
TOGETHER NOW....

08:49.833 --> 08:52.532
AND WE'LL GET
THROUGH THIS, TOO...

08:55.883 --> 08:57.972
ALL OF US.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.367
MADI?

09:02.411 --> 09:05.545
MADI? MADI.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.550
OH, SHE TOOK THE KEYS.

09:10.593 --> 09:13.117
SHE'S GOING TO FIGHT.
I HAVE TO STOP HER.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.510
WELL, THEM
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.599
NO, NO. IT'S FINE.
SHE WON'T GET FAR.

09:16.643 --> 09:17.905
YOU STAY HERE
AND FINISH UP.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.776
-I'LL BRING HER BACK.
-SHE'LL JUST DO IT AGAIN.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.082
AS LONG AS THAT THING
IS IN HER HEAD--

09:21.125 --> 09:23.563
I PROMISED HER I
WOULDN'T TAKE IT OUT.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.565
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

09:25.608 --> 09:28.959
YOU'RE ASKING SOMEONE WHO
SENT 100 KIDS TO THE GROUND

09:29.003 --> 09:32.615
TO KEEP HER OWN DAUGHTER
FROM BEING FLOATED.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.705
SO WHATEVER
IT TAKES, THEN?

09:35.749 --> 09:38.403
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.851
IT WON'T START.

09:50.894 --> 09:54.942
I TOOK OUT THE CONDUCTOR.
NOW LET'S GO.

09:54.985 --> 09:59.033
FINE. I'LL WALK, THEN.
OUT OF MY WAY.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.862
-NO.
-UH! LET GO OF ME.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.516
MADI, ASCENDE SUPERIUS.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.827
YOU TOOK OUT
THE CONDUCTOR.

10:10.871 --> 10:14.701
I CHANGED
THE PASS PHRASE.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.964
I'M NOT A CHILD
ANYMORE, CLARKE.

10:17.007 --> 10:21.229
I'M THE COMMANDER,
AND MY PEOPLE ARE DYING.

10:36.331 --> 10:39.682
I WILL NOT LET YOU
DIE IN THIS WAR.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.209
AAH!

10:45.253 --> 10:47.385
AAH!

10:57.526 --> 11:00.007
MM...

11:00.050 --> 11:02.444
BELLAMY:
O., DON'T MOVE.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.794
AH...

11:08.842 --> 11:12.236
I SAID,
DON'T MOVE.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.718
THE SECOND WE MOVE,
WE'RE DEAD.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.111
UH...

11:17.154 --> 11:20.418
-BLODREINA...
-GET DOWN.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.942
BLODREINA...

11:22.986 --> 11:24.161
UGH...

11:28.775 --> 11:30.428
AGH...

11:31.865 --> 11:35.042
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

11:35.085 --> 11:38.045
WE ARE NOT
DOING THIS NOW.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.264
JUDGING BY
THE NUMBER OF DEAD,

11:40.308 --> 11:41.788
SOME OF YOUR ARMY
MUST HAVE MADE IT

11:41.831 --> 11:44.007
BACK TO THE WASTELAND,
BUT THEY WON'T LAST LONG

11:44.051 --> 11:46.793
WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.185
I HAVE TO GET TO THEM.

11:48.229 --> 11:51.667
YOU LAY DOWN COVERING
FIRE, AND WE RUN.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.843
O., I LOST
MY WEAPON.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.410
WE HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL IT'S DARK.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.934
ONCE WE MAKE IT BACK,
WE GET THE RADIO,

11:57.978 --> 12:00.676
AND WE SURRENDER.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.070
WE CAN'T WIN.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.899
IT'S OVER, BUT WE CAN
STILL SAVE OUR PEOPLE.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.031
NOTHING IS OVER.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.120
YOUR INTEL WAS BAD,

12:10.164 --> 12:12.035
BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

12:12.079 --> 12:15.473
O., NO ONE
WILL FOLLOW YOU.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.780
THIS IS YOUR FAULT,
NOT MINE.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.695
YOU LED THEM HERE.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.003
YOU BURNT THEIR FARM,
AND YOU MADE THEM MARCH.

12:23.046 --> 12:26.397
THESE PEOPLE ARE DEAD
BECAUSE OF YOU.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.183
-O., STOP MOVING.
-PLEASE!

12:29.226 --> 12:30.140
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

12:30.184 --> 12:32.273
MAN: PLEASE. WE GIVE UP.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.797
BELLAMY:
GET DOWN. GET DOWN.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.115
SO MUCH FOR SURRENDER.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.742
MILLER, YOU'RE HIT.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.136
NATE,
LET ME SEE.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.225
NIYLAH: TAKE HIS BLOOD.
GIVE IT TO MILLER.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.227
MONTY: MILLER,
DID YOU SEE, BELLAMY?

13:13.270 --> 13:14.837
HE'S WITH OCTAVIA. WE GOT
TO GO BACK AND GET THEM.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.100
BRELL: GET THEM?
THIS IS THEIR FAULT.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.667
THE ENEMY WAS
WAITING FOR US.

13:18.710 --> 13:19.973
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
AND THE REST OF THE FLAME CULT

13:20.016 --> 13:22.018
-DIDN'T TURN TAIL--
-SAY THAT AGAIN.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.064
ENOUGH!

13:26.414 --> 13:29.678
WERE THEY ALIVE?

13:29.721 --> 13:33.334
MILLER: I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO GO BACK.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.553
BRELL: THEN YOU
GO BACK ALONE.

13:35.597 --> 13:38.339
NO ONE ELSE IS DYING
TO SAVE BLODREINA.

13:38.382 --> 13:41.908
BRELL, WE
COULD STILL WIN.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.957
WE COULD STILL WIN!

13:50.786 --> 13:53.528
MILLER: WE COULD STILL WIN.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.312
WE COULD STILL--

13:55.356 --> 13:56.270
JACKSON: HEY.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.014
GET ME A SUTURE KIT,
SOMETHING FOR HIS PAIN.

14:01.057 --> 14:04.278
-WE'RE ALL OUT.

14:04.321 --> 14:08.151
OF EVERYTHING.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.501
ECHO, ON RADIO:
BELLAMY, SKAI DRAG EM HOLA.

14:10.545 --> 14:13.417
GO. TAKE IT.
WE'VE GOT THIS.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.332
ECHO: BELLAMY,
SKAI DRAG EM HOLA.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.378
YU SEN AI IN.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.771
BELLAMY, COME IN.
DO YOU READ ME?

14:19.815 --> 14:21.643
ECHO, IT'S MONTY.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.558
TRIG, MONTY.
PUT BELLAMY ON.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.907
MONTY: I THOUGHT
THE SIGNAL WAS SAFE.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.953
-IT WAS DIYOZA.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.085
-THE BITCH BETRAYED US.
-WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.391
YEAH

14:30.434 --> 14:32.567
MURPHY: SHE WASN'T ALONE.
KANE BETRAYED US, TOO.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.916
ECHO:
EVERYONE BE QUIET.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.352
MONTY, WHERE
THE HELL IS BELLAMY?

14:35.396 --> 14:37.398
HE'S MISSING, BUT THERE'S
STILL GUNFIRE IN THE GORGE.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.182
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.967
GUYS, IF YOU DON'T FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT FAST,

14:41.010 --> 14:43.230
300 PEOPLE ARE
GONNA DIE OUT HERE.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.841
IF THERE ARE 300 OF YOU,
THEN ATTACK.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.843
-YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS.
-THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.236
THERE'S ONLY
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

14:49.279 --> 14:50.367
WILLING TO GO BACK IN.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.195
THEY'RE AT
EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.936
NOBODY'S IN CHARGE.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.851
ECHO, IF THE ENEMY
IS LISTENING--

14:55.895 --> 14:57.897
OK. WE UNDERSTAND,

14:57.940 --> 14:59.202
AND WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.204
RADIO SILENCE UNTIL THEN.
IS THAT CLEAR?

15:01.248 --> 15:03.293
COPY.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.516
MURPHY: WHAT ABOUT
AIR SUPPORT, THEN?

15:08.559 --> 15:09.952
TRANSPORT SHIP'S
GOT MISSILES, RIGHT?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.388
IF WE CAN GET ON BOARD,
TAKE CONTROL--

15:11.432 --> 15:14.261
NO WAY. THE ONE THING MCCREARY
DOESN'T HAVE IS A PILOT,

15:14.304 --> 15:16.437
AND YOU WANT TO WALK ONE
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR?

15:16.480 --> 15:19.353
ECHO: RAVEN'S RIGHT.
IT'S TOO RISKY.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.571
I AGREE
WITH MURPHY.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.095
IF WE CAN'T GET IN
THROUGH THE GORGE,

15:22.138 --> 15:24.140
THIS THING IS OVER, AND
THEY DIE IN THE WASTELAND.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.405
SO LET'S GET THEM
THROUGH THE GORGE.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.754
MURPHY, EMORI,
STAY HERE

15:29.798 --> 15:30.886
AND GET THAT
CANNON WORKING.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.105
SORRY. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:32.148 --> 15:34.672
MONTY SAYS THEY
NEED A LEADER,

15:34.716 --> 15:36.109
SO LET'S GO
GET THEM ONE.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.241
SHAW AND RAVEN,
YOU TWO ARE WITH ME.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.374
MURPHY: A LEADER?
SO WHY DON'T--

15:40.417 --> 15:43.725
BELLAMY'S IN TROUBLE.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.032
DO WHAT I SAY.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.397
BELLAMY: OK.
IT'S DARK ENOUGH.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.877
NEXT TIME IT PASSES,
WE GO.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.447
BELLAMY: OK. NOW.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.450
GET DOWN.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.412
WE'RE CLEAR. COME ON.

16:20.283 --> 16:23.025
O., O., WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

16:23.069 --> 16:26.028
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
PAST THOSE LIGHTS.

16:26.072 --> 16:26.986
-NO.
-GRAB A RIFLE.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.422
THERE'S ONE
RIGHT THERE.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.597
AS SOON AS YOU PULL
THAT TRIGGER, WE'RE DEAD.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.339
COME ON.
DON'T DO THIS.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.428
-UH!
-HELP HER.

16:34.471 --> 16:37.909
-UH!
-UH!

16:37.953 --> 16:42.958
-INDRA.
-GAIA'S HIT. IT'S BAD.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.091
OCTAVIA:
ARE YOU HIT, TOO?

16:45.134 --> 16:46.266
YEAH.

16:46.309 --> 16:47.745
WE HAVE TO GET
GAIA TO JACKSON.

16:47.789 --> 16:50.792
-COME ON, INDRA.
-NO. WE CAN'T MOVE HER.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.141
WONKRU WILL
COME BACK FOR US.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.796
BELLAMY: IT'S OK.
OK. WE GOT THIS.

16:54.839 --> 16:58.060
OCTAVIA: OK.
FIRST, WE STOP THE BLEEDING.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.020
NOT HERE.
WE NEED COVER.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.284
THEY WON'T SEE US
BEHIND THOSE ROCKS.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.502
NOW.

17:10.899 --> 17:14.294
NOW. COME ON.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.688
OCTAVIA: RUN.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.348
OK. EVEN IF WE
STOP THE BLEEDING,

17:25.392 --> 17:28.351
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
CARRYING HER.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.527
INDRA: SAVE YOURSELVES.
I'M NOT LEAVING MY DAUGHTER.

17:30.571 --> 17:33.530
OCTAVIA: INDRA'S RIGHT.
THEY'LL COME BACK FOR US.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.493
GAIA: WHY ARE
YOU DOING THIS?

17:39.536 --> 17:44.063
A WEEK AGO, YOU
THREW US IN THE PIT.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.370
A WEEK AGO,
YOU WERE A TRAITOR.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.765
NEXT WEEK, YOU
MAY BE AGAIN.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.723
RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE WONKRU.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.421
BELLAMY: SHE THINKS WHEN WONKRU
COMES BACK, YOU'LL TELL

17:54.464 --> 17:56.945
THE FOLLOWERS OF THE FLAME
TO FOLLOW HER

17:56.988 --> 17:59.121
BACK THROUGH THIS GORGE.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.994
OCTAVIA: IF THEY DON'T,
EVERYBODY DIES.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.464
MCCREARY SAID
YOU'D FINISHED.

18:37.507 --> 18:42.338
122 PROCEDURES IN 5 DAYS
WITHOUT PILLS.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.558
I HEARD THAT, TOO.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.650
WHERE'S CLARKE?

18:49.693 --> 18:51.826
I'D LIKE TO THANK HER
FOR HELPING YOU

18:51.869 --> 18:53.001
WHEN I COULDN'T.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.524
I ASKED HER AND MADI
TO SLEEP AT THE CHURCH

18:54.568 --> 18:57.136
SO WE COULD TALK.

19:00.313 --> 19:04.534
I KNOW THAT LOOK.
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:05.883 --> 19:09.148
MCCREARY WON'T ACCEPT
WONKRU'S SURRENDER.

19:10.323 --> 19:13.369
THEY'RE ALL GONNA
GET WIPED OUT,

19:13.413 --> 19:16.067
AND I TOLD THEM
HOW TO DO IT.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.550
AND I GAVE HIM
THE ABILITY TO.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.900
I'M JUST SO TIRED
OF HAVING TO CHOOSE

19:22.944 --> 19:25.512
THE LEAST--

19:25.555 --> 19:28.384
LEAST BAD OPTION--

19:28.428 --> 19:32.171
OCTAVIA OR MCCREARY,

19:32.214 --> 19:34.042
STARVATION OR--

19:35.696 --> 19:38.264
FIRST, WE SURVIVE.

19:38.307 --> 19:41.005
THEN WE GET
OUR HUMANITY BACK.

19:42.616 --> 19:45.619
YOU TOLD ME THAT,
REMEMBER...

19:51.364 --> 19:53.888
A LONG TIME AGO.

19:58.545 --> 20:01.635
I WISH I STILL
BELIEVED IT.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.551
WE'LL GET THERE.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.586
MMPH! MMPH!

20:41.762 --> 20:43.503
MM. MM-HMM.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.679
ECHO: THEN GET READY
TO PROVE IT.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.377
HEY, EASY.
ECHO, LET HER GO.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.336
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO HURT YOU.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.642
I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

20:52.686 --> 20:55.950
YOU THINK WONKRU WILL FOLLOW ME
INTO THAT GORGE.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.823
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

20:59.867 --> 21:02.913
TAKE OFF THE COLLAR
BEFORE CLARKE GETS BACK.

21:05.046 --> 21:09.006
SAFE TO SAY, SHE'S NOT
UP FOR MOTHER OF THE YEAR.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.748
LIGHT.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.274
YOU KNOW, IT'S NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.145
YOU MIND TALKING
TO SOMEONE ELSE, KID?

21:17.188 --> 21:19.147
I'D LIKE YOUR HEAD
NOT TO EXPLODE.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.066
CLARKE: GET THE HELL
AWAY FROM HER.

21:25.109 --> 21:25.936
HEY, CLARKE.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.764
HAVEN'T SEE YOU
IN 6 YEARS,

21:27.808 --> 21:30.027
AND THIS IS HOW
YOU SAY HELLO?

21:30.071 --> 21:34.510
CLARKE, PUT DOWN THE GUN.
THESE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.

21:34.554 --> 21:39.036
QUIET, MADI.
NOW, RAVEN.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.603
BACK AWAY.

21:40.647 --> 21:43.650
YOU, TOO, SHAW.
WEAPONS DOWN.

21:43.693 --> 21:46.130
ECHO: DO AS SHE SAYS.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.049
UH!

21:54.356 --> 21:56.358
MADI: SORRY, CLARKE. UH!

21:56.402 --> 21:58.491
-RAAGH!
-OW!

21:58.534 --> 22:01.581
ECHO: UH! AH! OHH!

22:01.624 --> 22:04.758
RAVEN: I'LL GET
THE COLLAR.

22:06.107 --> 22:09.066
OH!

22:09.110 --> 22:12.113
AGH! UH! UH...

22:15.508 --> 22:16.770
SHE LEFT
BELLAMY TO DIE.

22:16.813 --> 22:20.382
NOW, OR I WON'T
GO WITH YOU.

22:24.473 --> 22:27.911
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

22:31.872 --> 22:36.659
HER MIC IS OPEN.
WE HAVE TO GO, NOW.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.671
TAKE OUR PILOT
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND

22:48.715 --> 22:50.586
BACK TO THE SHIP.

22:50.630 --> 22:51.674
UH!

22:51.718 --> 22:53.415
COME ON.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.156
UH! LET GO.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.897
CLARKE, HOW COULD
YOU DO THIS?

22:56.940 --> 23:00.770
-KILL THE SPY.
-WAIT. WE NEED TO TALK TO HER.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.820
MCCREARY: WHAT DO
THEY WANT FROM HER?

23:06.863 --> 23:08.822
I DON'T KNOW,

23:08.865 --> 23:11.738
BUT IF YOU KILL ECHO,
WE'LL NEVER FIND OUT.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.482
OH...

23:17.613 --> 23:18.875
UH!

23:22.444 --> 23:24.838
YOU TWO STAY HERE.

23:24.881 --> 23:27.754
WHEN THEY'RE DONE
TALKING, KILL HER.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.975
THANK YOU, CLARKE.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.195
NOW THAT WE HAVE
OUR MISSILES BACK,

23:34.238 --> 23:36.806
IT'S TIME TO END THIS
SO THAT BOTH OUR CHILDREN

23:36.850 --> 23:39.983
CAN LIVE HAPPILY
EVER AFTER.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.349
ABBY?

24:01.265 --> 24:04.486
VINSON:
ABBY'S NOT HERE.

24:04.530 --> 24:07.881
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
SHE WENT TO EXAMINE

24:07.924 --> 24:09.535
COLONEL DIYOZA.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.759
OH, THE TRIGGER
TO MY COLLAR?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.587
IT WAS IN HER HAND
WHEN SHE LEFT.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.807
OK. THANK YOU, VINSON.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.723
I'LL TELL HER YOU
WERE LOOKING FOR HER.

24:23.766 --> 24:26.987
ACTUALLY, IT WAS YOU
I CAME TO SEE.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.689
ALL RIGHT.

24:36.344 --> 24:39.042
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

24:39.086 --> 24:41.392
I HEAR THE BATTLE IS
GOING WELL, THANKS TO YOU,

24:41.436 --> 24:43.438
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
DEAD IN A SINGLE DAY.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.396
THAT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.876
ALL MY DAYS
ADDED TOGETHER,

24:46.920 --> 24:49.618
IT WOULDN'T EVEN
COME CLOSE.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.926
I KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE,
AND I'LL STRUGGLE

24:52.969 --> 24:55.842
TO LIVE WITH THAT
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.888
IF ONLY A CONSCIENCE
WAS A FREE PASS

24:58.932 --> 25:00.716
AND NOT JUST A VOICE
IN YOUR HEAD

25:00.760 --> 25:04.503
YOU PRETEND TO LISTEN TO
BETWEEN UNSPEAKABLE ACTS.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.723
I MYSELF AM UNBURDENED
BY CONSCIENCE.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.552
WELL, I'M HAPPY
FOR YOU.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.947
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

25:13.990 --> 25:16.602
I NEED TO GET
TO THE BRIDGE.

25:18.473 --> 25:22.477
WHY NOT EMBRACE
THE DEMON INSTEAD

25:22.521 --> 25:25.001
THE WAY ABBY DOES?

25:32.008 --> 25:34.663
I GET HER PILLS
FOR HER.

25:34.707 --> 25:37.710
-NO, BUT SHE'S CLEAN NOW.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.929
I'M SURE YOU'RE GRATEFUL
THAT SHE SAVED YOUR LIFE,

25:39.973 --> 25:45.369
SO IF YOU TRULY CARE
FOR HER, YOU'LL STOP,

25:45.413 --> 25:46.936
AND YOU LET HER HEAL.

25:46.980 --> 25:50.723
I CAN'T DO THAT.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.768
ALL RIGHT. I THINK
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.727
MOST ADDICTS FALL
OFF THE WAGON

25:54.770 --> 25:56.424
IN THE WAKE OF
PERSONAL TRAGEDY--

25:56.467 --> 25:57.860
DID YOU KNOW THAT?--

25:57.904 --> 25:59.688
THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE,
FOR INSTANCE.

25:59.732 --> 26:03.300
-UH! UH!
-NO! STOP!

26:03.344 --> 26:05.999
-RRGH!
-UH!

26:06.042 --> 26:06.956
UH!

26:11.221 --> 26:13.484
AARGH!

26:13.528 --> 26:15.617
-AAGH!
-OHH!

26:15.661 --> 26:20.013
OHH! UHH!

26:20.056 --> 26:21.188
AARGH...

26:45.386 --> 26:48.694
OK.

26:48.737 --> 26:52.088
-ABBY...
-SHH. DON'T TRY TO TALK.

26:52.132 --> 26:55.614
I--I CAN FIX IT.

26:58.442 --> 27:00.140
I FORGIVE YOU.

27:00.183 --> 27:04.710
I KNOW YOU TOLD OCTAVIA
TO BREAK ME.

27:08.104 --> 27:11.412
MARCUS, HANG ON.
HANG ON.

27:11.455 --> 27:15.546
SHE KILLED THOSE
PEOPLE, NOT YOU.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.984
IT WAS OCTAVIA.

27:20.595 --> 27:23.119
IT WAS OCTAVIA.

27:41.572 --> 27:44.010
INDRA: NO.

28:09.557 --> 28:12.038
BELLAMY: HEY, NO.

28:15.824 --> 28:18.740
WHAT ABOUT MADI?

28:18.784 --> 28:21.395
WHAT KIND
OF FLAMEKEEPER

28:21.438 --> 28:23.266
LEAVES A 12-YEAR-OLD
COMMANDER

28:23.310 --> 28:25.573
TO FEND FOR HERSELF?

28:25.616 --> 28:29.751
KEEP FIGHTING,
IF NOT FOR YOU,

28:29.795 --> 28:32.014
THEN FOR HER.

28:39.282 --> 28:42.329
I BROKE IT.

28:42.372 --> 28:45.201
YES. YOU DID.

29:00.129 --> 29:02.131
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

29:04.090 --> 29:07.267
HOW'S YOURS?

29:07.310 --> 29:09.269
I IMAGINE, BECOMING
A TRAITOR IN THE EYES

29:09.312 --> 29:12.620
OF EVERYONE YOU EVER
CARED ABOUT MUST SUCK.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.796
IT DOES...

29:16.189 --> 29:18.278
BUT IF IT MEANS
KEEPING MADI SAFE,

29:18.321 --> 29:20.802
I CAN LIVE WITH IT.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.457
THE GREAT WANHEDA,

29:23.500 --> 29:28.070
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING
TO PROTECT HER PEOPLE.

29:28.114 --> 29:32.031
CORRECTION--PERSON.

29:34.294 --> 29:37.297
TOO BAD SHE DOESN'T
APPRECIATE IT.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.480
WE'VE ALL GOT BLOOD
ON OUR HANDS, DON'T WE,

29:46.523 --> 29:48.874
OR DO YOU THINK THOSE
PEOPLE YOU BLEW UP

29:48.917 --> 29:51.267
IN MOUNT WEATHER
DON'T COUNT BECAUSE

29:51.311 --> 29:54.444
YOU WERE
FOLLOWING ORDERS?

29:55.794 --> 29:59.449
I SHOULD'VE KILLED YOU
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

29:59.493 --> 30:02.713
WELL, THAT MAKES MY DILEMMA
A LITTLE EASIER, THEN.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.628
WHAT DILEMMA?

30:04.672 --> 30:07.240
THOSE MEN OVER MY SHOULDER
HAVE ORDERS TO KILL YOU

30:07.283 --> 30:10.112
AS SOON AS WE
STOP TALKING.

30:10.156 --> 30:14.334
I PREFER THEY
DIDN'T DO THAT.

30:14.377 --> 30:17.163
WHY DO YOU CARE?

30:17.206 --> 30:19.556
BELLAMY LOVED YOU.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.559
YOU WERE
GOOD FOR HIM.

30:22.603 --> 30:26.737
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
HE WAS GOOD FOR YOU, TOO.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.827
HMM.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.350
WHAT?

30:30.393 --> 30:33.701
BELLAMY'S NOT DEAD,
CLARKE.

30:33.744 --> 30:36.399
AT LEAST, HE WASN'T
UNTIL HE--

30:42.928 --> 30:45.452
HE SURVIVED YOUR
BETRAYAL IN POLIS

30:45.495 --> 30:49.412
LONG ENOUGH TO MARCH STRAIGHT
INTO YOUR BETRAYAL HERE.

30:49.456 --> 30:53.329
WHAT, NOW YOU CARE
ABOUT BELLAMY?

30:53.373 --> 30:55.375
I ALWAYS CARED.

30:55.418 --> 30:56.767
DON'T WORRY.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.378
IF HE'S STILL
ALIVE IN THAT GORGE,

30:58.421 --> 31:00.380
HE WON'T BE ONCE
MCCREARY FORCES SHAW

31:00.423 --> 31:02.643
TO LAUNCH
THOSE MISSILES,

31:02.686 --> 31:06.168
TORTURING YOUR FRIEND RAVEN
TO GET HIM TO DO IT.

31:06.212 --> 31:09.519
HE PUT THE FLAME
IN MADI'S HEAD.

31:09.563 --> 31:11.782
HE DID THAT
TO SAVE US ALL,

31:11.826 --> 31:16.439
AND SHE TOOK IT WILLINGLY,
DIDN'T YOU, HEDA?

31:16.483 --> 31:18.920
DON'T
CALL HER THAT.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.880
SHE KNOWS I DID.

31:26.667 --> 31:31.759
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE
BRAVE AND RECKLESS

31:31.802 --> 31:34.414
AND BECAUSE I
WAS IN TROUBLE.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.851
MADI: THAT'S RIGHT.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.420
I DID IT
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.726
I THOUGHT LOVE
WAS WEAKNESS.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.598
ISN'T THAT
WHAT THE COMMANDERS

31:44.641 --> 31:46.339
IN YOUR HEAD
TELL YOU?

31:46.382 --> 31:48.907
YES, ALL BUT ONE.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.130
I THINK YOU SHOULD
GET SOME SLEEP.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.654
I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP.

31:57.698 --> 32:00.614
EVERY TIME
I CLOSE MY EYES,

32:00.657 --> 32:05.967
I SEE YOU OUTSIDE
THE DOOR AT MOUNT WEATHER

32:06.011 --> 32:12.234
READY FOR WAR,
AND THEN I WALK AWAY,

32:12.278 --> 32:14.889
LEAVING YOU
THERE ALONE.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.414
LET ME TRANSLATE
THAT FOR YOU.

32:18.458 --> 32:21.504
LEXA PROTECTED HER PEOPLE
BY MAKING A DEAL

32:21.548 --> 32:25.508
WITH THE ENEMY,
LEAVING SKAIKRU TO DIE,

32:25.552 --> 32:29.512
YES, JUST LIKE
I'VE DONE HERE.

32:29.556 --> 32:31.514
I DON'T NEED GHOSTS
TELLING ME

32:31.558 --> 32:34.343
WHAT I'VE LOST TO
PROTECT YOU, MADI.

32:34.387 --> 32:39.044
CLARKE, SHE'S
NOT A GHOST.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.610
SHE'S REAL.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.482
THEY ALL ARE,
AND YOU'RE WRONG

32:42.525 --> 32:45.746
ABOUT WHY SHE'S
SHOWING ME THAT MEMORY.

32:45.789 --> 32:49.228
BETRAYING YOU IS
HER DEEPEST REGRET.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.580
SHE'S SHOWING
ME THAT BECAUSE

32:53.623 --> 32:55.582
SHE DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO MAKE

32:55.625 --> 32:58.541
THE SAME MISTAKE
SHE DID.

32:58.585 --> 33:02.545
PLEASE, CLARKE.
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

33:02.589 --> 33:06.245
I AM, TOO, BUT
I HAVE TO DO THIS,

33:06.288 --> 33:09.509
AND YOU
HAVE TO LET ME.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.342
OH, MADI...

33:17.691 --> 33:20.346
THIS IS HOW
WE SURVIVE.

33:21.564 --> 33:24.002
IT MAY BE...

33:25.960 --> 33:29.659
BUT LIFE SHOULD BE ABOUT
MORE THAN JUST SURVIVING.

33:38.712 --> 33:42.194
THEY'RE DONE TALKING.
THIS ONE'S YOURS.

33:52.726 --> 33:53.683
MAN: WHAT?

33:55.381 --> 33:56.947
UGH...

34:08.655 --> 34:10.439
-GOOD CHOICE.
-COME ON.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.485
WE NEED TO GET TO THE FRONT
BEFORE THE MISSILES DO.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.139
WE CAN TAKE THE ROVER.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.749
GOOD. MURPHY AND EMORI

34:15.792 --> 34:19.144
HAVE ONE OF
THE SONIC CANNONS.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.798
CLARKE, THERE'S NO TIME.
WE HAVE TO GO.

34:21.842 --> 34:25.106
NO. YOU HAVE TO GO.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.890
I HAVE TO STOP
THAT TRANSPORT SHIP

34:26.934 --> 34:29.502
FROM TAKING OFF SO YOU
CAN LEAD YOUR PEOPLE

34:29.545 --> 34:31.678
THROUGH THAT GORGE.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.724
HERE. YOU'LL NEED THIS
TO START THE ENGINE.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.726
REMEMBER WHERE IT GOES?

34:36.770 --> 34:39.773
CLARKE, PLEASE.
I NEED YOU.

34:39.816 --> 34:42.950
YOU WILL ALWAYS
HAVE ME.

34:42.993 --> 34:46.693
I WILL ALWAYS
PROTECT YOU.

34:46.736 --> 34:49.304
THIS IS HOW
I DO THAT NOW.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.785
ECHO WILL BE
BY YOUR SIDE.

34:51.828 --> 34:54.744
EVERY STEP
OF THE WAY.

34:54.788 --> 34:57.443
LISTEN TO ME.

34:57.486 --> 35:00.098
YOU'RE
SO SPECIAL, MADI,

35:00.141 --> 35:02.187
I KNEW IT THE DAY
I MET YOU

35:02.230 --> 35:04.798
WHEN YOU LED ME
INTO THAT BEAR TRAP.

35:04.841 --> 35:09.498
ALL THIS TIME, YOU THOUGHT
I WAS KEEPING YOU ALIVE,

35:09.542 --> 35:14.155
BUT IT WAS YOU
WHO SAVED ME.

35:14.199 --> 35:19.421
YOU ARE MADI KOM
LOUWODA KILRON KRU,

35:19.465 --> 35:21.423
HEIR TO
BECCA PRAMHEDA,

35:21.467 --> 35:24.731
SUCCESSOR
TO LEXA KOM TRIKRU.

35:24.774 --> 35:27.734
I LOVED HER SO MUCH,
BUT IT'S NOTHING

35:27.777 --> 35:30.563
COMPARED TO HOW MUCH
I LOVE YOU.

35:40.312 --> 35:42.618
MADI: WHAT IF I
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN?

35:42.662 --> 35:45.578
NO, NOT POSSIBLE.

35:45.621 --> 35:48.363
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

35:52.237 --> 35:53.803
IT'S SIMPLE.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.631
YOU MAY BE
THE COMMANDER,

35:55.675 --> 35:58.895
BUT I'M THE COMMANDER
OF DEATH,

35:58.939 --> 36:02.464
AND I SAY,
WE WILL MEET AGAIN.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.918
GO SAVE HIM.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.891
-AH!
-RAVEN, STOP.

36:37.934 --> 36:40.502
-WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
-NO. WE'RE NOT.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.678
LOOK. MCCREARY'S
GONNA TORTURE US

36:42.722 --> 36:45.725
UNTIL HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS,
AND I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN,

36:45.768 --> 36:49.990
SO I NEED YOU TO WORK
ON MY COLLAR.

36:50.033 --> 36:52.253
I'M NOT ASKING
YOU TO TAKE IT OFF.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.690
I'M ASKING YOU
TO TURN IT ON.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.606
I'M NOT
KILLING YOU, SHAW.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.218
I'M NOT
BOMBING WONKRU.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.180
YOU'RE WORRIED
YOU'LL BREAK?

37:06.224 --> 37:09.227
YES. I WILL WHEN
THEY TORTURE YOU.

37:10.924 --> 37:14.449
PLEASE, RAVEN.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

37:14.493 --> 37:18.366
IF WE TAKE ME OFF THE TABLE,
MCCREARY HAS NOTHING.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.108
I CAN'T TRIGGER A SUSTAINED
JOLT MYSELF, BUT IF YOU--

37:23.502 --> 37:26.026
BUCKLE UP, LIEUTENANT.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.898
IT'S GONNA BE
A BUMPY RIDE.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.306
OCTAVIA: THERE'S SOMEONE
ALIVE OUT THERE.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.874
BELLAMY: GET DOWN.
THEY'LL SEE YOU.

37:51.617 --> 37:54.010
WHAT DO YOU CARE
IF I DIE?

37:54.054 --> 37:57.536
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

37:57.579 --> 37:59.842
YES.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.811
HER HEARTBEAT IS SLOWING.

38:11.854 --> 38:15.336
WE NEED TO GO NOW.
I'LL GIVE THEM A TARGET.

38:15.380 --> 38:19.035
THE NEXT TIME
THEY OPEN FIRE, WE RUN.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.994
I'LL CARRY GAIA.

38:21.037 --> 38:24.171
NO.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.565
YOU'RE NOT
DYING FOR ME.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.264
OCTAVIA: SHE'S RIGHT.

38:41.667 --> 38:46.062
I MAY NEVER BE ABLE
TO FIX WHAT I BROKE,

38:46.106 --> 38:49.109
BUT I CAN SAVE YOU.

38:49.152 --> 38:51.894
I'M THE ONE THEY WANT
MOST OF ALL.

38:53.374 --> 38:57.813
WHEN THEY OPEN FIRE,
RUN LIKE HELL.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.458
MY BROTHER...

39:36.199 --> 39:38.376
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

39:50.257 --> 39:51.519
UH! GET DOWN!

39:54.130 --> 39:58.352
YOU ARE WONKRU,
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.049
CHOOSE.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.411
UHH...

40:30.253 --> 40:33.169
ECHO: OCTAVIA,
GET IN, NOW!

40:35.215 --> 40:36.999
AAGH!

40:39.219 --> 40:40.176
UH!

40:41.177 --> 40:43.963
YEAH! SOMEBODY
CALL FOR A RESCUE?

40:46.008 --> 40:48.446
EMORI: HURRY UP!
WE'RE NOT STAYING.

40:48.489 --> 40:50.491
THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU FIXED THIS THING.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.493
I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T.

40:53.755 --> 40:56.149
IT'S GONNA BLOW!
THROW IT NOW!

41:02.111 --> 41:04.374
COME ON. IN.
GET IN.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.849
YEAH!
