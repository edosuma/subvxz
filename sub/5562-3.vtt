WEBVTT

00:04.138 --> 00:06.671
Oh, my god, you
were so drunk.
Oh.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.139
I love their
parties.
Yeah.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.306
All right.

00:09.308 --> 00:11.441
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.

00:11.443 --> 00:14.177
<i> Buenas noches! </i>
See you in class.

00:15.747 --> 00:17.613
(thudding, glass breaking,
man laughing)

00:17.615 --> 00:21.617
(distant chatter)

00:21.619 --> 00:25.320
(panting, distant siren blaring)

00:25.322 --> 00:28.189
(soft gasp)

00:30.793 --> 00:32.793
(gasps)
<i>lo siento. </i>
I'm sorry.

00:32.795 --> 00:34.795
Campus police.

00:34.797 --> 00:36.663
I just thought you might
need help getting home.

00:36.665 --> 00:39.699
I'm sorry.
Were you speaking spanish?

00:39.701 --> 00:42.134
Yes, I'm-I'm... I'm from peru.

00:53.347 --> 00:55.080
<i> SÃ­.</i>

00:57.617 --> 00:58.816
Everything is okay.

00:58.818 --> 01:00.551
I'm just taking
the lady home.

01:00.553 --> 01:02.219
I'll need to see your id.

01:02.221 --> 01:04.621
Not yours, ma'am.

01:04.623 --> 01:05.722
(gasps softly)

01:07.092 --> 01:08.524
His.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.425
One of our
uniforms was

01:10.427 --> 01:11.692
Stolen out of a locker tonight.

01:11.694 --> 01:15.529
I've been here ten years,

01:15.531 --> 01:17.430
And I don't recognize you.

01:17.432 --> 01:21.534
Like I told the lady,
I just started working here.

01:21.536 --> 01:23.536
Here's my I.D.

01:23.538 --> 01:24.803
(groaning)

01:24.805 --> 01:26.471
(woman screaming, man screams)

01:26.473 --> 01:27.839
(screaming)

01:30.543 --> 01:32.609
(yells)

02:03.541 --> 02:07.509
Well, it's that
time again.

02:07.511 --> 02:10.545
The bi-monthly office
security assessment.

02:10.547 --> 02:14.148
Boy, oh, boy.

02:14.150 --> 02:15.549
Really?

02:15.551 --> 02:16.883
Bi-monthly-- does that mean

02:16.885 --> 02:19.785
That it's twice a month,
or is it every two months?

02:19.787 --> 02:23.555
Come on, g.
This stuff is important.
Or does it swing both ways?

02:23.557 --> 02:25.657
I'm not giving you
the cliff notes version again.

02:25.659 --> 02:28.126
Read it yourself.
Just as I thought--
swings both ways.

02:28.128 --> 02:30.428
See, now, that is confusing.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.834
Okay.

02:36.836 --> 02:38.702
I will read it.

02:40.872 --> 02:42.137
Can't read that.

02:42.139 --> 02:43.738
Come on. It was two seconds.
No.

02:43.740 --> 02:47.274
I'm telling you
that it's not able to be read.

02:47.276 --> 02:49.576
Copier must be
out of toner.

02:49.578 --> 02:51.911
They've been giving us copies
like this for days.

02:51.913 --> 02:53.913
The hell with it.

02:53.915 --> 02:55.848
I'm changing the toner myself.

02:55.850 --> 02:57.282
You're gonna what?

02:57.284 --> 02:58.783
I'm gonna change
the toner myself.

02:58.785 --> 03:00.251
It's ridiculous.

03:00.253 --> 03:01.485
Enough is enough.

03:01.487 --> 03:03.353
You're changing the toner?

03:03.355 --> 03:06.422
I'm doing what no one else
here is willing to do.

03:08.759 --> 03:10.291
Do you know what
you're doing?

03:10.293 --> 03:12.459
It's not rocket science.

03:12.461 --> 03:14.327
Okay? It's like changing a roll

03:14.329 --> 03:15.728
Of toilet tissue.

03:15.730 --> 03:18.430
When it runs out and it's empty,
you put a new one on.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.698
You don't ignore it.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.833
Oh, you're not gonna let me
forget that, are you?

03:22.835 --> 03:26.203
I didn't know where you
kept your extra rolls.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.171
You could have looked.

03:28.873 --> 03:31.540
How hard was that?

03:33.310 --> 03:36.511
Um... What are you doing?

03:36.513 --> 03:38.613
I am changing the toner.

03:38.615 --> 03:40.681
(whirring)

03:41.617 --> 03:43.650
It's still not working.

03:43.652 --> 03:45.385
Yeah, that's because
I just changed it,

03:45.387 --> 03:47.620
So, you just put
the old toner back in.

03:47.622 --> 03:48.887
Callen:
Huh.

03:48.889 --> 03:50.922
That's kind of
like taking the new

03:50.924 --> 03:53.557
Toilet paper off the
roll and replacing it

03:53.559 --> 03:55.559
With used toilet paper.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.329
I'm just saying I've never
done anything like that.

03:59.331 --> 04:01.397
(whistling)

04:01.399 --> 04:03.198
Oh, problem with the copier?

04:03.200 --> 04:04.899
Did you try, uh,
changing the toner?

04:05.902 --> 04:08.669
(laughing)
eric:
Okay.

04:08.671 --> 04:10.871
We, uh, got a case.

04:10.873 --> 04:13.406
I'll switch it
back. Thank you.

04:13.408 --> 04:15.975
Lesson still applies.

04:15.977 --> 04:18.243
That toner should have
been changed yesterday.

04:24.550 --> 04:26.716
We waiting for kensi and deeks?

04:26.718 --> 04:28.918
No. Play it, beale.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.436
(clears his throat)

04:30.437 --> 04:31.953
This was two nights
ago on the campus

04:31.956 --> 04:33.822
Of gateway university.

04:33.824 --> 04:35.857
Both men perished at the scene.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.859
Gateway? That's in st. Louis,
right?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.493
We taking a trip?

04:39.495 --> 04:41.328
Only back in time,
agent hanna.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.530
The shooter was a disgraced

04:43.532 --> 04:45.732
Lieutenant in the peruvian
army who worked directly

04:45.734 --> 04:47.433
Under general alfredo silva.

04:47.435 --> 04:49.802
Sam:
Silva? He was the leader
of grupo patria

04:49.804 --> 04:51.303
Back in the '90s, right?

04:51.305 --> 04:52.937
Yeah, peruvian
death squads.

04:52.939 --> 04:54.271
They killed a
lot of people.

04:54.273 --> 04:55.972
Including 32 civilians

04:55.974 --> 04:59.675
At a political gathering
in 1997 in the town of posta.

04:59.677 --> 05:01.710
Granger: For years,
the global criminal tribunal

05:01.712 --> 05:03.478
At the hague has sought
charges against silva

05:03.480 --> 05:04.979
For crimes against humanity.

05:04.981 --> 05:07.414
Eric:
Yeah, but nothing
ever seems to stick.

05:07.416 --> 05:10.517
Silva is a master
at silencing witnesses.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.353
Granger:
But now the tribunal thinks
they may have found a young girl

05:13.355 --> 05:14.921
Who survived the posta massacre.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.023
A daughter of one
of the victims.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.026
Eric:
The woman you see here is
one of four young women

05:20.028 --> 05:23.729
The tribunal suspects
may actually be that survivor.

05:23.731 --> 05:25.363
It's 20 years later. Why now?

05:25.365 --> 05:27.832
Silva is running
for president of peru.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.366
Eric:
And doing nicely
in the polls, I might add.

05:29.368 --> 05:30.533
Granger
let's just say

05:30.535 --> 05:33.035
The case took on
a renewed urgency.

05:33.037 --> 05:35.471
Eric:
If the tribunal
can get the girl's

05:35.472 --> 05:37.906
Testimony along with a dna match
to the massacre victims...

05:37.908 --> 05:39.607
They'd have a smoking gun.

05:39.609 --> 05:41.041
But since the st. Louis attack,

05:41.043 --> 05:42.776
It's clear
the tribunal has a leak.

05:42.778 --> 05:44.611
That's why elmslie came to us.

05:44.613 --> 05:46.012
Alex elmslie?
Yeah.

05:46.014 --> 05:48.447
Callen:
He's the investigator
for the tribunal?

05:48.449 --> 05:50.348
I thought they fired elmslie
after what he did to jada.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.716
I'm sure he'll tell you
all about it.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.350
He's in the boatshed preparing

05:53.352 --> 05:55.719
To meet the last woman
on his list.

05:55.721 --> 05:58.388
Eric:
The st. Louis girl's dna was
tested, and she did not match.

05:58.390 --> 05:59.655
Neither did the other two.

05:59.657 --> 06:01.623
There's only one woman left,

06:01.625 --> 06:02.890
And she's in los angeles.

06:02.892 --> 06:04.758
Granger:
Until we determine there's

06:04.760 --> 06:06.293
Still a threat,

06:06.294 --> 06:07.827
Kensi and deeks have gone
undercover to keep her safe.

06:07.829 --> 06:09.528
They're on their way
to get her now.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.695
Who is she?

06:10.697 --> 06:12.563
Uh... (clears his throat)

06:12.565 --> 06:17.000
Just a warning-- these images
might not be safe for work.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.301
(computer trilling)

06:25.476 --> 06:27.008
Callen:
Some days I love my job.

06:32.948 --> 06:34.647
Kensi:
This girl has to be
the only person

06:34.649 --> 06:36.715
In l.A. Who doesn't drive.

06:36.717 --> 06:38.850
Deeks:
That's because catalina diaz
is a self-entitled model.

06:38.852 --> 06:40.918
She's probably never
carried her groceries,

06:40.920 --> 06:42.920
Or paid for a single
drink in her life.

06:42.922 --> 06:45.555
If she is who elmslie
thinks she is,

06:45.557 --> 06:47.557
She's had
a pretty rough childhood.

06:47.559 --> 06:49.926
Yeah, so did I, so
did you, and you can still

06:49.928 --> 06:51.594
Execute a power slide
while firing a weapon.

06:51.596 --> 06:53.762
You know what that is?
That's my kind of girl.

06:53.764 --> 06:55.663
What are you doing? Oh, we
can make time for this later

06:55.665 --> 06:57.698
If you really want
to get into my pants.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.832
Oh, wait. No,
can I just...?

06:58.834 --> 07:00.633
Hey! Oh.
Oh, yeah.

07:00.635 --> 07:02.534
Oh, yeah,
that's your kind of woman.

07:02.536 --> 07:04.402
Yeah.
And that one.

07:04.404 --> 07:06.036
No.
Oh, and there's that one.

07:06.038 --> 07:07.337
That's just research,
'cause I like

07:07.339 --> 07:09.039
To go into every case

07:09.040 --> 07:10.740
With a strong understanding
of my subject's...
Bra size?

07:10.741 --> 07:12.441
(doorbell rings)
I was gonna say
"background," but 34b.

07:12.444 --> 07:13.743
Not that I was...

07:14.712 --> 07:16.678
Yeah?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.112
Hi, catalina.
My name is kensi.

07:18.114 --> 07:19.746
I'm from o.M.A.
Ethan sent me.

07:19.748 --> 07:21.781
I am incredibly sorry
for the mix-up,

07:21.783 --> 07:23.449
But it turns out
your<i> rose line</i> magazine shoot

07:23.451 --> 07:25.417
Is actually
this morning.

07:25.419 --> 07:26.718
What?

07:26.720 --> 07:27.885
It's supposed
to be next week.

07:27.887 --> 07:29.686
We haven't even had
a fitting yet.

07:29.688 --> 07:31.854
I know, and I'm incredibly sorry
about that.

07:31.856 --> 07:33.789
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I'm calling ethan.

07:33.791 --> 07:35.791
Yeah, you can call him
from the car,

07:35.793 --> 07:37.592
Because we're really,
really late already.

07:37.594 --> 07:39.594
Fine.

07:39.596 --> 07:41.596
But put your hair up.

07:41.598 --> 07:42.997
I can't have
my agent's assistant

07:42.999 --> 07:44.765
Looking better than me.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.633
Huh.

07:46.635 --> 07:48.401
Who are you?

07:48.403 --> 07:50.669
Uh, I'm marty.
I'm your driver for today.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.071
Uh, walter ruptured
his spleen...
Whatever.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.639
Just let me get my stuff.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.907
You can... You can wait inside.

07:57.876 --> 07:59.876
Never as glamorous
in person.

07:59.878 --> 08:02.612
Kind of makes you
wonder how I do it.

08:03.548 --> 08:05.014
Wow.

08:05.016 --> 08:06.982
Look at this place.

08:06.984 --> 08:09.050
Maybe I should
be a model.

08:09.986 --> 08:12.553
(muffled snort)

08:16.759 --> 08:20.794
I realize
you must have reservations.

08:20.796 --> 08:22.695
Last time we crossed paths,
you tried to kill a witness

08:22.697 --> 08:24.663
And tossed a grenade at us.

08:24.665 --> 08:26.865
It was a smoke grenade,
to be fair.

08:26.867 --> 08:30.101
Also, my family was
being held hostage.

08:30.103 --> 08:31.869
How are they?

08:31.871 --> 08:33.871
Fine.

08:33.873 --> 08:35.839
Better, thank you.

08:35.841 --> 08:37.607
I find it hard to believe

08:37.609 --> 08:39.976
That the tribunal would take
you back after what you did.

08:39.978 --> 08:42.812
They gave me an office.
It's only temporary.

08:42.814 --> 08:46.182
It all depends
on how this case pans out.

08:46.184 --> 08:49.752
Callen:
General alfredo silva.

08:49.754 --> 08:52.020
He's been an obsession of mine
even before I lost my job.

08:52.022 --> 08:54.555
For years, I heard
the stories of

08:54.557 --> 08:57.824
<i> La niÃ±a que viviÃ³-- </i>
the girl who lived--

08:57.826 --> 08:59.725
But no one could find her.

08:59.727 --> 09:03.462
Then I checked adoption records.

09:03.464 --> 09:05.630
In the 12 months following
her disappearance,

09:05.632 --> 09:08.599
Four girls matching her age
and description were sent

09:08.601 --> 09:09.967
To american families.

09:09.969 --> 09:11.134
Sam:
That's a shot

09:11.136 --> 09:12.635
In the dark, elmslie.

09:12.637 --> 09:14.770
That's what the tribunal said.

09:14.772 --> 09:16.805
But then st. Louis.
Exactly.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.773
If silva's taking
these extreme measures,

09:18.775 --> 09:20.708
It means
that I'm on the right track.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.810
I just need this last girl
to listen to me.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.645
I've tried to reach her

09:24.647 --> 09:26.613
On the phone, but she
refuses to talk to me.

09:26.615 --> 09:28.781
Heads up. Catalina's coming in.

09:30.818 --> 09:33.919
If she is<i> la niÃ±a que viviÃ³,</i>

09:33.921 --> 09:35.887
You're digging up
some painful memories.

09:35.889 --> 09:37.989
Can't blame her
for wanting to forget.

09:37.991 --> 09:40.858
It has to be her.

09:42.995 --> 09:45.228
(phone ringing)

09:45.230 --> 09:46.963
Oh, hey, this is ethan.

09:46.965 --> 09:49.131
I'm gonna hang back.
I'll-I'll be right in.

09:49.133 --> 09:50.866
Fine. Whatever.

09:50.868 --> 09:52.801
(door closes)
catalina?

09:52.803 --> 09:55.937
Yeah. I'm ready.

09:55.939 --> 09:57.939
Where's lillian?

09:57.941 --> 10:02.176
Catalina, I'm alex elmslie from
the global criminal tribunal?

10:02.178 --> 10:04.845
I've been trying
to meet with you... About peru.

10:04.847 --> 10:06.479
About the killings in posta.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.747
What? What is this?
There's no shoot?

10:08.749 --> 10:10.515
Callen:
Catalina, I know

10:10.517 --> 10:12.817
You're scared. This is just
a conversation, nothing more.

10:12.819 --> 10:14.518
You're not
in trouble.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.886
It feels like I'm in trouble.

10:15.888 --> 10:17.854
This man--
he has been harassing me.

10:17.856 --> 10:18.855
Elmslie:
Well,

10:18.857 --> 10:20.907
I'm genuinely sorry

10:20.908 --> 10:22.958
About the deception,
but I needed you to hear me out.

10:22.961 --> 10:24.260
I already heard you out.

10:24.262 --> 10:26.895
I told you, I don't know
anything about a massacre.

10:26.897 --> 10:28.530
I wasn't there.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.164
You could be suppressing
the memory. If you'd let me do

10:30.166 --> 10:31.798
A dna test...
Oh, god!

10:31.800 --> 10:33.633
Oh, damn it, will you just...?

10:33.635 --> 10:35.167
Elmslie!

10:35.169 --> 10:36.935
I know

10:36.937 --> 10:38.970
You saw something that day.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.604
People were killed.

10:40.606 --> 10:41.838
You could be
in danger, too.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.206
Are you threatening me?

10:43.208 --> 10:44.874
No.

10:44.876 --> 10:46.942
No. You're misunderstanding me.

10:46.944 --> 10:48.710
No, I understand just fine!

10:48.712 --> 10:50.712
It is you who is confused!

10:50.714 --> 10:52.213
Stay the hell away from me!

10:52.215 --> 10:53.781
Catalina?
No. We're leaving!

10:53.783 --> 10:55.149
We're leaving!

10:55.151 --> 10:56.850
If I find out you know about
this, I'll have your job.

10:56.852 --> 10:58.918
Catalina?

11:03.758 --> 11:05.324
You heard all of that?

11:05.325 --> 11:06.891
Of course I heard all that.
She doesn't want to talk.

11:06.894 --> 11:08.260
What do we do now?

11:08.262 --> 11:10.895
Until we know if silva
has other men out there,

11:10.897 --> 11:12.863
You and deeks
need to stand with her.

11:12.865 --> 11:15.298
And elmslie--
can we trust him this time?

11:19.604 --> 11:21.670
Good question.

11:31.014 --> 11:33.647
You want to tell me
what the hell happened in here?

11:33.649 --> 11:37.217
I'll admit my diplomatic skills
are a bit rusty.

11:37.219 --> 11:38.985
You sure that was it?

11:38.987 --> 11:41.654
I just need the dna test
to at least confirm my theory.

11:41.656 --> 11:43.122
If we could

11:43.124 --> 11:45.257
Obtain a court order...
Your evidence
was too slim, alex.

11:45.259 --> 11:47.826
You had your chance
and you blew it.

11:52.098 --> 11:53.630
I know you all think I'm crazy,

11:53.632 --> 11:55.264
But a mass murderer
is on the verge

11:55.266 --> 11:56.999
Of controlling
an entire country.

11:57.001 --> 11:59.301
If catalina diaz
can help us stop him...

11:59.303 --> 12:01.269
All this will be worth it.

12:01.271 --> 12:03.304
Kensi and deeks
will try to get catalina

12:03.306 --> 12:05.005
To consent to a dna test.

12:05.007 --> 12:06.873
Either way,

12:06.875 --> 12:09.141
We still have a leak
inside the tribunal.

12:09.143 --> 12:10.642
We?

12:10.644 --> 12:12.010
If silva has more men
in the country,

12:12.012 --> 12:14.312
The best way to find out
is to plug that leak.

12:14.314 --> 12:16.280
Fine.
You got any suspects?

12:16.282 --> 12:19.216
I brought the case
to the l.A. Office a month ago.

12:19.218 --> 12:21.351
Only two people
were briefed on it:

12:21.353 --> 12:23.619
Lead prosecutor charles yoon...

12:24.822 --> 12:28.156
And director of investigations
hilary toussard.

12:28.158 --> 12:29.824
I'll have eric
run their finances

12:29.826 --> 12:31.692
And check on their
family members.

12:31.694 --> 12:33.894
We're gonna need to search
their computer as well.
Again,

12:33.896 --> 12:36.029
We don't have the evidence
to get a warrant, so nothing

12:36.031 --> 12:38.197
You find will be
admissible in court.

12:38.199 --> 12:39.364
We don't need to bring a case
against them,

12:39.366 --> 12:41.132
We just need to stop them.

12:45.605 --> 12:47.371
If you get caught,
I'm gonna show you

12:47.373 --> 12:50.207
What a real crime
against humanity is.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.675
Elmslie:
Yoon and toussard

12:51.677 --> 12:53.209
Have called me in
for a meeting in an hour.

12:53.211 --> 12:56.111
I can keep them
busy long enough

12:56.113 --> 12:58.213
For you to do
what needs to be done.

13:08.324 --> 13:10.274
(door closes)

13:10.275 --> 13:12.225
Catalina:
<i> And ethan-- if this</i>
<i> happens again,</i>

13:12.227 --> 13:14.293
<i> I'll find a new agent.</i>

13:16.263 --> 13:18.129
You two check out.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.264
My driver is sick
and I swear, my agent

13:20.266 --> 13:22.132
Goes through, like,
five assistants a week.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.134
And you're totally right
in feeling annoyed by that.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.970
I-I take full
responsibility for this mix-up.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.338
I can't believe
that guy tricked us like that.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.639
I'm so sorry.

13:29.641 --> 13:31.340
And the urbelle shoot
later today?

13:31.342 --> 13:33.008
Oh.
That's make-or-break

13:33.010 --> 13:36.344
For my career. So no more
creepy brit who wants my saliva.

13:36.346 --> 13:38.346
No, that is for real, for sure.

13:38.348 --> 13:40.081
I called them,
it is all confirmed.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.849
Again, I'm so, so, so...

13:41.851 --> 13:44.384
Sorry, sorry. Yes, I know. I've
heard it already five today.

13:44.386 --> 13:46.052
I don't want to hear
anymore apologies.

13:54.161 --> 13:55.426
So what does the tribunal
want with you?

13:55.428 --> 13:57.428
Something about a
massacre in peru?

13:57.430 --> 14:00.964
I don't know. It's not even
my country anymore.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.365
I was
raised here.

14:02.367 --> 14:05.901
I love america. I love l.A.

14:05.903 --> 14:07.936
Except the drive, of course.

14:11.374 --> 14:14.775
My, uh, my parents...

14:14.777 --> 14:16.276
My adoptive parents--

14:16.278 --> 14:19.245
They died in a crash
when I was 15.

14:19.247 --> 14:21.847
I couldn't bring myself

14:21.849 --> 14:24.249
To get behind the wheel
after that.

14:24.251 --> 14:27.218
I'm sorry.

14:27.220 --> 14:30.120
What about your real parents?
Did you ever know them?

14:32.958 --> 14:34.157
(clears throat)
driver.

14:34.159 --> 14:35.358
Yes, ma'am?

14:35.360 --> 14:36.359
I'm hungry.

14:36.361 --> 14:37.760
Absolutely,
ma'am.

14:37.762 --> 14:39.828
What do you have in mind?

14:39.830 --> 14:42.063
Anything.
I don't care.

14:42.065 --> 14:44.165
Got a little bit of traffic,
but don't worry--

14:44.167 --> 14:45.799
I got just the place.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.434
Sit back and relax.
I got you.

14:57.944 --> 14:59.143
Okay, down the hall?
Yeah.

14:59.145 --> 15:00.410
Okay.
Yup.

15:01.379 --> 15:02.945
Excuse me.

15:02.947 --> 15:04.313
Here comes elmslie.

15:04.315 --> 15:07.349
(indistinct conversation)

15:07.351 --> 15:09.017
Hi.

15:09.019 --> 15:11.052
Doug from tech support.
We got a call about

15:11.054 --> 15:12.453
Some, uh, spotty wi-fi.

15:12.455 --> 15:14.238
Oh, uh,

15:14.239 --> 15:16.022
Yeah, it started going
in and out about an hour ago.

15:16.025 --> 15:18.225
Uh-huh. All right, well, we're
gonna put a range extender in.

15:18.227 --> 15:19.893
I just need to
install it in

15:19.895 --> 15:21.261
Room... 207.

15:21.263 --> 15:23.863
Sure. Um...

15:23.865 --> 15:25.464
I'll let you in.

15:27.401 --> 15:30.301
(chuckles)

15:30.303 --> 15:32.369
Guess we should
follow you. (chuckles)

15:35.774 --> 15:38.074
Right...

15:38.076 --> 15:39.875
Ah, cheese
and crackers!

15:39.877 --> 15:42.377
Sorry. Just started
working this week.

15:42.379 --> 15:44.912
I'm still trying to get
the lay of the land.

15:44.914 --> 15:46.914
Let me know if
you need any...
(phone rings)

15:46.916 --> 15:48.982
Oh, jeez... Excuse me.

15:52.053 --> 15:55.120
Coming, coming.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.188
Saved by the nell.

16:07.199 --> 16:10.266
All right, eric, you
should have access...

16:10.268 --> 16:12.468
Now.

16:13.938 --> 16:14.970
What are you doing?

16:14.972 --> 16:18.206
I'm searching.
For what?

16:18.208 --> 16:19.407
They're not gonna leave
anything incriminating

16:19.409 --> 16:21.342
Just laying around.

16:21.344 --> 16:22.776
Doesn't hurt to check.

16:22.778 --> 16:24.444
(chuckles)

16:24.446 --> 16:26.345
What?
Nothing, it's
just that,

16:26.347 --> 16:28.113
Um... Someone's gonna

16:28.115 --> 16:30.381
Have to actually install
this range extender.

16:30.383 --> 16:31.515
There's nothing wrong
with the wi-fi.

16:31.517 --> 16:33.517
Eric's disrupting the signal.

16:33.519 --> 16:35.085
But they don't know that.
And I just figured

16:35.087 --> 16:36.252
'cause of your whole, you know,

16:36.254 --> 16:37.886
"do what needs
to get done" thing,

16:37.888 --> 16:39.420
That maybe you might
want a little redemption

16:39.422 --> 16:41.422
From the whole
toner debacle today.

16:41.424 --> 16:43.323
I'm fine.

16:43.325 --> 16:44.424
You sure?
Oh, yeah.

16:44.426 --> 16:46.459
You want to install it,
install it.

16:46.461 --> 16:48.427
No, I'm doing the, uh,
I'm doing the computer.

16:48.429 --> 16:50.829
No, uh, actually,
eric's doing the computer.

16:50.831 --> 16:52.163
Well, I'm... Supervising.

16:52.165 --> 16:54.365
You're super
getting on my nerves.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.532
Little bit?
Little bit.

16:55.534 --> 16:56.900
You're super at that.

16:56.902 --> 16:58.334
Genius.
Uh-huh.

16:58.336 --> 16:59.501
Elmslie (in distance):
Get your hands off me!

16:59.503 --> 17:02.437
You're making
a huge mistake.

17:02.439 --> 17:05.373
Don't touch me.
Let me go.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.442
No, don't touch me, damn it!

17:08.444 --> 17:11.111
Hilary, I didn't
leak anything. Please,

17:11.113 --> 17:13.513
You know me.
I wouldn't do this.

17:13.515 --> 17:14.580
The meeting
was a set up.

17:14.582 --> 17:16.882
They think
elmslie's the leak.

17:16.884 --> 17:18.450
We can't blow our cover.

17:18.452 --> 17:20.852
Let's finish this up quickly
and get out of here.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.827
See, here's the thing, though.
I feel like you're just

17:29.829 --> 17:31.528
Being kind.
I want you to be honest.

17:31.530 --> 17:33.563
Like, seriously.
You think I could do it?

17:33.565 --> 17:35.965
Yeah.
Yeah?

17:35.967 --> 17:38.200
You could be a model.
See?
(scoffs)

17:38.202 --> 17:39.834
If it was 2008.

17:39.836 --> 17:41.101
What?
(laughs)

17:41.103 --> 17:43.236
The homeless look's
out of style.

17:43.238 --> 17:45.438
Oh.
Try running a comb
through your hair,

17:45.440 --> 17:47.940
Maybe some pomade.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.075
That's a perfect idea.
A comb would be good.
Nope.

17:50.077 --> 17:51.276
Forget it, no one's
touching this hair,

17:51.278 --> 17:53.478
Because this hair
is style-by-pillow.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.113
(catalina chuckles)
people want classy now.

17:56.115 --> 17:59.916
Successful.
They want the fantasy look.

17:59.918 --> 18:02.118
Well, last Halloween I dressed
up like bilbo baggins.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.854
Is that fantasy enough?

18:04.855 --> 18:07.589
I'm pretty sure she's talking
about that kind of fantasy.

18:07.592 --> 18:10.092
Deeks:
Wow.

18:10.094 --> 18:11.393
That's you.

18:11.395 --> 18:14.062
On sunset boulevard,
looking hot.

18:14.064 --> 18:16.564
That's a huge deal.
Congratulations.

18:16.566 --> 18:18.499
That's a stepping stone. You
want to do tv and film, right?

18:18.501 --> 18:21.068
That's why today's shoot
is so important.

18:21.070 --> 18:23.236
Urbelle is a huge line.

18:23.238 --> 18:24.854
Exactly.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.471
So I think you
have to put yourself out there.

18:26.474 --> 18:27.940
And I'm talking about
the real you, catalina.

18:27.942 --> 18:31.209
No more hiding behind
other peoples' clothes.

18:31.211 --> 18:35.179
I know that you want
nothing to do with the tribunal,

18:35.181 --> 18:38.015
However, wait--

18:38.017 --> 18:40.017
It would show people that
you stand for something.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.451
That you care.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.885
You think I don't care?

18:42.887 --> 18:44.286
You just met me.

18:44.288 --> 18:47.389
And I think it's time
for the world to meet<i> you.</i>

18:47.391 --> 18:50.492
Otherwise you're just
another pretty face.

18:50.494 --> 18:53.060
Don't be a face,
be a force.

18:55.964 --> 18:57.463
We should get to the shoot.

18:57.465 --> 18:59.631
We have another few minutes.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.299
No, I-I don't
want to be late.

19:01.301 --> 19:03.366
We should get to the shoot.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.003
She's scared.

19:08.005 --> 19:09.471
Well, her career's
finally taking off.

19:09.473 --> 19:11.573
She feels like she's
got a lot to lose. I get that.

19:11.575 --> 19:14.542
I think it's more than that.

19:18.414 --> 19:20.113
What do you got?

19:20.115 --> 19:22.081
According to the data you
retrieved from toussard's

19:22.083 --> 19:23.348
Computer, it seems
the tribunal's

19:23.350 --> 19:25.116
Been tracking
elmslie's e-mails

19:25.118 --> 19:26.383
Since his return.

19:26.385 --> 19:28.218
Does anyone
trust this guy anymore?

19:28.220 --> 19:30.353
Well, they found evidence he
sent the list of women's names

19:30.355 --> 19:32.488
To a peruvian e-mail address.

19:32.490 --> 19:35.591
You know, I hate to say it, g,

19:35.593 --> 19:39.227
But... You've seen elmslie.

19:39.229 --> 19:41.195
This case is an obsession.

19:41.197 --> 19:42.296
He may have leaked those names

19:42.298 --> 19:43.930
To see if silva took action.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.965
Which would prove
his case, I know. I...

19:45.967 --> 19:47.967
Elmslie's acted
out of desperation before,

19:47.969 --> 19:49.969
But I can't imagine
he'd go this far.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.037
Is there any evidence
that his e-mail was hacked?

19:52.039 --> 19:54.339
Honestly, it's not that hard
to access someone's e-mail.

19:54.341 --> 19:57.108
I mean, you'd just need
to get their office.

19:57.110 --> 19:59.443
Having the keys would help.

19:59.445 --> 20:01.945
Toussard had a new assistant.
Mm-hmm.

20:01.947 --> 20:04.314
I wonder why
her predecessor left.

20:04.316 --> 20:08.284
Eric, can you...
Find toussard's previous
assistant, got it.

20:08.286 --> 20:09.418
Mason hinty.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.420
Oh--

20:11.422 --> 20:13.955
And he's got a one-way ticket
out of lax later this week.

20:13.957 --> 20:15.957
Destination: Morocco.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.325
Take the money and run.

20:17.327 --> 20:19.260
To a non-extradition country.

20:19.262 --> 20:21.228
Okay, I'm tracking his cell.

20:21.230 --> 20:23.129
He is driving west on pico.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.433
Okay, turn left into the alley.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.501
Hinty's cell signal stops there.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.116
Eric, we've
located hinty.

20:47.118 --> 20:49.351
Get an ambulance over here.
Nell, track an suv

20:49.353 --> 20:50.652
Headed south on laurel.

20:50.654 --> 20:52.286
Nell:
Okay, got it.

21:09.204 --> 21:11.037
I just got off with the fbi.

21:11.039 --> 21:13.372
You've been cleared
of all wrongdoing.

21:17.244 --> 21:21.212
Ncis seems to be making a habit
of saving my skin.

21:21.214 --> 21:24.782
I also talked to your superiors
at the tribunal.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.284
Because their office
was compromised,

21:27.286 --> 21:30.353
They think it's best
if ncis take lead on this case.

21:30.355 --> 21:32.388
Which leaves me
somewhat awkwardly

21:32.390 --> 21:34.456
Dancing with two partners.

21:38.195 --> 21:40.094
Or none at all.

21:40.096 --> 21:42.096
Depends on you, alex.

21:42.098 --> 21:44.164
When we looked into
the immediate families

21:44.166 --> 21:47.367
Of the people of the tribunal,
we also looked into yours.

21:47.369 --> 21:49.702
We thought it
was only prudent

21:49.704 --> 21:51.770
After what happened
three years ago.

21:56.309 --> 21:58.709
The joke was on me.

21:58.711 --> 22:03.080
I risked my career and my life
to save my family...

22:03.082 --> 22:06.283
Only to have them leave me
a year later.

22:07.619 --> 22:10.553
How often do you get
to see your daughter?

22:10.555 --> 22:13.155
Few times a year, if I'm lucky.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.290
The judge...

22:15.292 --> 22:17.409
(exhales)

22:17.410 --> 22:19.527
...Didn't look favorably
on my drinking habits.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.364
Cheers, by the way.

22:32.241 --> 22:34.241
(sets glass down)

22:34.243 --> 22:36.676
This is my last chance...

22:36.678 --> 22:38.778
To get back in,

22:38.780 --> 22:40.846
Maybe earn
my family's trust back.

22:42.616 --> 22:46.851
I may be desperate, owen, but
I am on the right track. Please.

22:54.226 --> 22:56.259
Then let's find out.

22:57.362 --> 23:00.129
You said you need
the girl's dna.

23:03.868 --> 23:06.235
Well, I've got it.

23:12.175 --> 23:14.508
So, the suv
fleeing the scene

23:14.510 --> 23:16.676
Was ditched under
the 10 freeway, but...

23:16.678 --> 23:18.878
I grabbed this from
a nearby surveillance camera.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.412
Eric:
Captain victor cruz,

23:20.414 --> 23:22.380
Another grupo patria officer.

23:22.382 --> 23:24.315
I think it's time
we bring catalina

23:24.317 --> 23:25.816
Into protective custody.

23:25.818 --> 23:29.519
Gentlemen, let me talk
with miss diaz first,

23:29.521 --> 23:31.654
Then we'll bring her in.

23:31.656 --> 23:34.490
Hetty, grupo patria
does not mess around.

23:34.492 --> 23:37.759
I assure you, mr. Hanna,
she'll be well protected.

23:37.761 --> 23:40.261
You got an ace
up your sleeve?

23:40.263 --> 23:42.196
Oh, no, mr. Callen, I find cards

23:42.198 --> 23:45.265
Get in the way of my derringer.

23:45.267 --> 23:49.269
Find victor cruz.

23:49.271 --> 23:52.338
Elmslie's case
hinges on her dna.

23:52.340 --> 23:55.140
So cruz wipes every trace of it.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.909
Well, you know what they say--
"home is where the heart is."

23:57.911 --> 23:59.610
And also dead skin,

23:59.612 --> 24:01.311
Hair, saliva,

24:01.313 --> 24:02.412
Toenails,

24:02.414 --> 24:04.514
And other dna stuff.
Ew.

24:05.283 --> 24:07.316
No one says that.

24:08.252 --> 24:10.852
Let's start
with catalina's house.

24:15.224 --> 24:17.857
Too much?

24:17.859 --> 24:20.159
I was at<i> your </i>
home last night.

24:20.161 --> 24:22.928
I know. But I always clean
before our board game nights.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.663
Hmm, do you?

24:26.366 --> 24:28.165
(impressed whistle)

24:28.167 --> 24:30.233
Â¶ Â¶

24:34.439 --> 24:36.305
Are we sure
this is a photo shoot

24:36.307 --> 24:38.340
And not, like, a... Horror film?

24:38.342 --> 24:39.341
Boo!

24:40.310 --> 24:41.676
Deeks:
Sorry.

24:41.678 --> 24:43.878
(clears throat)
sorry, ma'am.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.381
Oh, excuse my silliness.

24:47.383 --> 24:49.716
Miss diaz,
I'm henrietta lange.

24:49.718 --> 24:52.785
I'm going to be directing
your photo shoot this afternoon.

24:52.787 --> 24:55.788
I thought we had julian winston.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.790
Hetty: Julian
sends his regrets

24:57.792 --> 25:00.425
And recommends me
in his place.

25:00.427 --> 25:02.593
I've never heard of you.

25:02.595 --> 25:03.760
Kensi:
It's quite all right.

25:03.762 --> 25:05.562
I've heard
of ms. Henrietta lange.

25:05.563 --> 25:07.363
In fact, she took over for
the emporio armani campaign

25:07.365 --> 25:09.631
When mert and marcus
had to pull out.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.265
(laughs softly)

25:11.267 --> 25:13.400
Oh, wow, I'm...

25:13.402 --> 25:15.368
So honored.
Oh,

25:15.370 --> 25:17.703
Uh, well, actually, that...

25:17.705 --> 25:19.604
Wasn't true.

25:19.606 --> 25:22.239
Special agent blye
is doing

25:22.241 --> 25:25.375
A superb job
of protecting my cover,

25:25.377 --> 25:28.311
But I think in this
case it-it just...

25:28.313 --> 25:29.445
We don't need it.

25:29.447 --> 25:30.579
Excuse me.

25:30.581 --> 25:32.647
Special agent?
Yeah.

25:32.649 --> 25:33.981
Catalina,

25:33.983 --> 25:37.951
You are a big girl--
you can make your own choices.

25:37.953 --> 25:42.322
If you choose not to cooperate
with the tribunal, that's fine.

25:42.324 --> 25:44.824
That's your life;
I respect that.

25:44.826 --> 25:47.359
I also understand how important

25:47.361 --> 25:49.327
This photo shoot is
to you today.

25:49.329 --> 25:51.662
But we've just confirmed
that there

25:51.664 --> 25:53.664
Are men out there

25:53.666 --> 25:56.333
Who wish you harm.

25:56.335 --> 25:59.869
So you have
another choice to make.

25:59.871 --> 26:02.671
You could allow
my people

26:02.673 --> 26:05.006
To remain

26:05.008 --> 26:07.975
And be your protection.

26:07.977 --> 26:09.977
Or... I could cancel

26:09.979 --> 26:14.247
The photo shoot and drag you
along against your will.

26:15.883 --> 26:17.849
Uh, um...

26:17.851 --> 26:19.817
The first one.

26:19.819 --> 26:21.351
Oh, that's such

26:21.353 --> 26:23.252
A good choice;
best choice.

26:23.254 --> 26:24.820
Just to clarify,

26:24.822 --> 26:27.022
I am directing the shoot today.

26:27.024 --> 26:29.724
So let's get you
into wardrobe.

26:29.726 --> 26:30.891
Okay.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.692
Chop-chop, people!

26:32.694 --> 26:35.294
We're on a clock!

26:35.296 --> 26:36.662
(chuckles)
come.

26:36.664 --> 26:38.296
Come... With...

26:38.298 --> 26:39.797
Me.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.532
(clears throat)

26:42.501 --> 26:44.267
That just happen?
Mm-hmm.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.835
You want to talk
about it?
No.

26:45.837 --> 26:47.670
No need.
Okay. All right.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.705
Callen:
Kensi and deeks

26:49.707 --> 26:53.608
Wouldn't have left
catalina's place
open like this.

26:53.610 --> 26:56.010
G, the entry door's
open as well.

27:04.619 --> 27:06.685
Federal agents!
Drop the bucket!

27:11.491 --> 27:12.923
Callen:
Eric, quick, catalina's house--

27:12.925 --> 27:14.457
Does she have
a cleaning service?

27:14.459 --> 27:15.624
Uh...

27:15.626 --> 27:17.592
Yeah-- river road cleaning,

27:17.594 --> 27:18.993
(over radio):
Every Monday.

27:20.463 --> 27:22.362
S-sonia gonzalez.

27:22.364 --> 27:24.630
Eric:
All right, running her name
through employment records.

27:24.632 --> 27:27.032
Gotcha. I'm sending
you a photo as well.

27:28.001 --> 27:29.467
Confirmed.

27:29.469 --> 27:31.402
Sonia gonzalez is an employee

27:31.404 --> 27:32.954
Of river road cleaning.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.505
It'll be a moment
on the photo, though.

27:34.507 --> 27:35.639
<i> Lo siento.</i>

27:35.641 --> 27:38.375
(hanna continues
speaking spanish)

27:40.379 --> 27:42.612
What are we gonna do with<i> her?</i>

27:42.614 --> 27:45.348
If victor cruz shows up,
she'll be safer inside with us.

27:45.350 --> 27:47.350
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

27:51.856 --> 27:54.989
(sonia speaking spanish
over radio)

27:57.393 --> 27:59.059
Callen, sam,

27:59.060 --> 28:00.726
This woman
is not sonia gonzalez.
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

28:00.729 --> 28:02.428
Eric say that again?

28:02.430 --> 28:03.796
(hanna speaking spanish)

28:03.798 --> 28:05.464
(grunting)

28:16.409 --> 28:18.509
(turns off vacuum cleaner)

28:18.511 --> 28:20.695
I knew I smelled gasoline.

28:20.696 --> 28:22.880
She was sent here
to torch this place.

28:22.882 --> 28:25.916
Eric:
Guys, did you hear me? She
is not a real cleaning woman.

28:25.918 --> 28:27.984
Thanks, eric.

28:27.986 --> 28:30.553
Good to know.

28:30.555 --> 28:32.821
This is so good, catalina!

28:32.823 --> 28:34.989
It's just wonderful.

28:34.991 --> 28:37.758
Now that you've built
your masterpiece,

28:37.760 --> 28:41.628
I want you to imagine
destroying it!

28:41.630 --> 28:43.496
Â¶ Â¶

28:43.498 --> 28:44.797
Yes!

28:44.799 --> 28:46.999
I guess it's true what they say:

28:47.001 --> 28:48.967
(over radio):
You catch more flies with hetty.

28:48.969 --> 28:50.969
She's betting the show
of respect will make catalina

28:50.971 --> 28:53.604
More inclined to cooperate
with the tribunal.

28:53.606 --> 28:57.140
I call that
being a force, not a face.

28:57.142 --> 28:58.741
Oh, really?
Shut up.

28:58.743 --> 29:00.809
Where did you even hear that,
for god's sakes?

29:00.811 --> 29:02.076
I-I don't remember.

29:02.078 --> 29:03.744
You don't remember?
Oh, I remember.
Mm.

29:03.746 --> 29:05.979
You read it
off your bottle of face wash.

29:05.981 --> 29:07.513
Yeah, that's right, princess.

29:07.515 --> 29:10.449
You gave career advice
from soap.

29:10.451 --> 29:11.917
Okay, it was very good advice,
and plus,
is it?

29:11.919 --> 29:13.419
How do you even know that?

29:13.420 --> 29:14.920
Have you been using
my face soap, again? Hmm?

29:14.922 --> 29:16.488
Well, monty has
very sensitive skin.

29:16.490 --> 29:17.722
Yeah, he does.
Oh, does he?

29:17.724 --> 29:19.590
You got a visitor
at your nine o'clock.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.558
(shutter clicking)

29:21.560 --> 29:22.926
He's definitely
checking her out.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.064
Deeks (over radio):
Kenz?

29:29.066 --> 29:30.698
Federal agents!
Deeks: On your knees! Now!

29:30.700 --> 29:32.566
Hands up where
we can see them.

29:32.568 --> 29:34.167
I'm just here to see catalina.

29:34.169 --> 29:36.002
Catalina:
What are you doing!

29:36.004 --> 29:37.169
You know this guy?

29:37.171 --> 29:39.971
That's gabriel!
My boyfriend!

29:43.843 --> 29:45.975
Ah.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.513
(indistinct talking over phone)
mm-hmm. Right.

29:51.515 --> 29:52.780
Thanks, eric.

29:52.782 --> 29:57.017
Lapd found the real maid
a couple blocks away tied up.

29:57.019 --> 29:58.151
She was unharmed.

29:58.153 --> 29:59.585
Eric's got nothing
on this one.

29:59.587 --> 30:02.421
She must have been
living here illegally.

30:02.423 --> 30:03.555
She's a loyal soldier.

30:03.557 --> 30:04.889
She didn't say a word.

30:04.891 --> 30:06.891
This silva guy's
getting on my nerves.

30:06.893 --> 30:09.560
I want to put him away.
I agree, agent hanna,

30:09.562 --> 30:12.129
But that just got
more difficult.

30:12.131 --> 30:14.431
Catalina diaz is not
<i> la niÃ±a que viviÃ³.</i>

30:14.433 --> 30:15.732
Her dna doesn't match

30:15.734 --> 30:17.767
Any of the victims
from the posta massacre.

30:17.769 --> 30:20.202
How do you know?
She never agreed
to give a sample.

30:20.204 --> 30:22.537
No. But I took one.

30:22.539 --> 30:24.639
The water bottle.

30:24.641 --> 30:26.073
When'd you swipe that?

30:26.075 --> 30:28.675
A magician never reveals
his secrets.

30:30.111 --> 30:32.144
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

30:32.146 --> 30:36.081
I've wasted everybody's
time and...

30:36.083 --> 30:39.484
Put innocent lives in danger.

30:39.486 --> 30:41.118
The general's hit squad
still thinks

30:41.120 --> 30:42.919
That catalina's
their target.

30:42.921 --> 30:46.122
Have blye bring that girl in.

30:46.124 --> 30:47.690
All right, you got it.

30:47.692 --> 30:49.558
We're bringing her in.
She in there with gabriel?

30:49.560 --> 30:51.092
Yeah, but you may be
interrupting something.

30:51.094 --> 30:52.927
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?
Little bit.

30:52.929 --> 30:54.995
Catalina! Let's go!

30:56.565 --> 30:58.598
Catalina, open the door.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.232
Just go. Go. Go.

31:00.234 --> 31:01.800
Catalina?

31:04.104 --> 31:05.870
(sighs): Damn it.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.206
That's not good.

31:11.175 --> 31:12.674
(camera shutter clicking)

31:20.917 --> 31:22.750
You lost her?

31:22.751 --> 31:24.584
We did not lose her;
she took off.
Well, maybe not.

31:24.587 --> 31:26.053
Maybe the boyfriend
was bought off by silva.

31:26.055 --> 31:27.721
Yeah, how did we not know
about the boyfriend?

31:27.723 --> 31:28.955
Because gabriel's
not her boyfriend.

31:28.957 --> 31:30.790
At least I hope
he's not her boyfriend.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.591
What, you got
a crush, beale?
No.

31:32.593 --> 31:34.526
I mean because
he's actually

31:34.528 --> 31:36.027
Her younger brother.

31:36.029 --> 31:38.062
Yeah, and kensi's
my twin sister.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.096
Ew.
Yeah, exactly. Why would
someone lie about that?

31:40.099 --> 31:42.132
Eric: And it wasn't
too hard to find.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.800
Once I did a background
on gabriel,

31:43.802 --> 31:45.268
I discovered that
both he and catalina

31:45.270 --> 31:48.037
Were adopted from peru
in may 1998

31:48.039 --> 31:49.972
By the same parents.

31:49.974 --> 31:52.274
So he's the<i> adoptive</i> brother--
that's very different, eric.

31:52.276 --> 31:54.943
Yeah, but still super weird.
Eric:
Agreed.

31:54.945 --> 31:56.511
Especially considering
there's a seven-year

31:56.513 --> 31:58.263
Age difference between them.

31:58.264 --> 32:00.014
I mean, gabriel was just a
baby when they were adopted.

32:00.016 --> 32:02.182
So we have
a padmÃ©-anakin scenario.

32:02.184 --> 32:03.884
Callen:
Or...

32:03.885 --> 32:05.585
Catalina's trying to hide
his true identity.

32:05.587 --> 32:06.852
Something's still

32:06.854 --> 32:08.887
Going on here.
Why don't you talk to elmslie,

32:08.889 --> 32:11.055
See what he
makes of this.
Okay.

32:12.158 --> 32:14.858
We got to find these two
before the general's men do.

32:14.860 --> 32:16.125
Yeah, well,
like his sister,

32:16.127 --> 32:18.260
Gabriel doesn't have
a driver's license.

32:18.262 --> 32:21.696
And his last address on file
is "adoptive parents,"

32:21.698 --> 32:23.264
Who are deceased.

32:23.266 --> 32:24.798
Hey, I've got
something.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.733
So, I've been going
through catalina's

32:26.735 --> 32:28.234
Credit card statements,
and once you scroll

32:28.236 --> 32:30.035
Past all the clothing
and makeup purchases,

32:30.037 --> 32:31.269
You'll find this.

32:31.271 --> 32:32.970
Chomp360.

32:32.972 --> 32:34.638
It's a food delivery service.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.272
Now, she has two addresses

32:36.274 --> 32:38.807
On file with them:
Her home address

32:38.809 --> 32:41.709
And an apartment
on wilshire and normandie.

32:41.711 --> 32:43.544
We're on it.

32:45.281 --> 32:49.549
Both gabriel and catalina
were adopted in may of 1998?

32:49.551 --> 32:51.050
That's right.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.718
May of 1998.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.252
Is it possible?

32:54.254 --> 32:56.687
What? Is what possible?

32:56.689 --> 32:58.555
General silva had a son.

32:58.557 --> 33:00.924
Born in February 1998.

33:00.926 --> 33:03.259
Nine months
after the posta massacre.

33:03.261 --> 33:06.061
That would make him
roughly the same age as gabriel.

33:06.063 --> 33:07.595
It would.

33:07.597 --> 33:11.065
But reports say
the boy died in a house fire.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.132
May 1998.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.802
Same month as the adoptions.

33:17.804 --> 33:19.570
Yes.
Do you think

33:19.572 --> 33:20.571
That the fire
was just a cover story

33:20.573 --> 33:22.573
And that gabriel is silva's son?

33:22.575 --> 33:24.908
(exhales)

33:24.910 --> 33:27.577
No.

33:27.579 --> 33:29.946
No, it's just another shot
in the dark.

33:29.948 --> 33:31.714
Like
this entire bloody case.

33:34.151 --> 33:38.620
Um, this article says that the
mother also died in the fire.

33:38.622 --> 33:41.589
That's right.
Blanca pÃ©rez.

33:41.591 --> 33:44.592
Yeah, well,

33:44.594 --> 33:47.761
Don't believe
everything you read.

33:53.702 --> 33:56.636
My god.

34:07.882 --> 34:09.047
(quietly):
Tell gabriel to come here.

34:09.049 --> 34:11.182
(quietly):
Catalina.

34:17.690 --> 34:20.190
Federal agents.
Put your hands up.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.991
(panting)

34:21.993 --> 34:24.059
Well...

34:26.329 --> 34:29.663
I guess it's just
a little lovers getaway, sam.

34:29.665 --> 34:32.265
Yeah. We know
who you are.

34:32.267 --> 34:34.833
I think it's time
we had a little talk.

34:38.205 --> 34:40.371
Kensi:
Blanca pÃ©rez.
You're looking pretty good

34:40.373 --> 34:42.406
For a dead woman.

34:42.408 --> 34:44.374
It says here that
you died in a fire

34:44.376 --> 34:47.176
17 years ago,
along with your son.

34:47.178 --> 34:49.945
Deeks:
Interesting enough, we had a
chance to meet him today, too.

34:49.947 --> 34:52.347
Just before he ran off
with his adoptive sister.

34:52.349 --> 34:54.215
Whose house, as
you may remember,

34:54.217 --> 34:56.984
You actually tried
to burn down today.

34:56.986 --> 35:01.154
You think maybe you want
to, uh, explain any of that?

35:03.858 --> 35:05.390
No?
Hmm.

35:05.392 --> 35:07.392
Okay, then I will.

35:07.394 --> 35:09.394
You see, we thought that you'd
gone there to kill catalina.

35:09.396 --> 35:11.396
But after reading
this, we realized

35:11.398 --> 35:14.432
That when you start a
fire, people don't die--

35:14.434 --> 35:17.334
They disappear,
they escape.

35:17.336 --> 35:19.336
You went there
to protect catalina.

35:19.338 --> 35:21.938
Like you've always
protected her.

35:21.940 --> 35:24.040
Like you did in posta.

35:26.744 --> 35:29.411
Hmm. I feel like we're doing
most of the talking here,

35:29.413 --> 35:31.980
So if you want to jump in,
that'd be helpful.

35:34.417 --> 35:37.284
You survived the massacre.
You and catalina.

35:37.286 --> 35:41.454
The general let you live, and
you gave him a son, gabriel.

35:41.456 --> 35:43.689
How else could they be brother
and sister, right?

35:43.691 --> 35:45.323
I mean, how else could
you guys be a family?

35:45.325 --> 35:47.091
This all goes back to posta.

35:49.095 --> 35:50.294
<i> SÃ­.</i>

35:50.296 --> 35:52.462
(sniffles)
I was there.

35:52.464 --> 35:53.930
I saw
the killings.

35:53.932 --> 35:55.131
(sniffles)
I saw

35:55.133 --> 35:57.700
What silva did to my friends.

35:57.702 --> 36:01.704
But he-he thought
I was beautiful, so...

36:01.706 --> 36:04.106
He spared my life and...
(sniffles)

36:04.108 --> 36:07.442
My daughter's life.

36:07.444 --> 36:09.477
That's why the test
didn't find a match.

36:09.479 --> 36:11.979
It only compared the dna
to the victims.

36:11.981 --> 36:14.281
But blanca's another survivor.

36:14.283 --> 36:16.416
Your shot in the dark
just hit a bull's-eye, alex.

36:16.418 --> 36:18.084
Kensi:
So what happened next,

36:18.086 --> 36:19.819
After you had gabriel?

36:20.788 --> 36:23.288
After that,

36:23.290 --> 36:26.424
He turned his eye
on-on my catalina.

36:26.426 --> 36:28.826
And when he touched her...

36:30.429 --> 36:33.930
I had to get my children away
from silva.

36:33.932 --> 36:36.065
So you started the fire
and put 'em up for adoption.

36:36.067 --> 36:38.100
I got them out of peru.
They wouldn't

36:38.102 --> 36:39.167
Have found the bodies
in the fire.

36:39.169 --> 36:40.168
Why would silva
put the story out

36:40.170 --> 36:41.169
That you and your son

36:41.171 --> 36:42.170
Had been
killed?

36:42.172 --> 36:44.505
Silva is a proud man.

36:44.507 --> 36:47.808
The truth would have made him
look weak.

36:47.810 --> 36:49.342
I thought he stopped looking
for us long ago.

36:49.344 --> 36:51.811
But then today
catalina texts me.

36:51.813 --> 36:55.481
She tells me that silva has men
in l.A. Looking for her.

36:55.483 --> 36:57.416
She's right.

36:57.418 --> 37:00.152
This is the man that silva sent.

37:00.154 --> 37:01.753
Cruz.

37:01.755 --> 37:04.421
He was there
the day of the massacre.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.491
When he kills,

37:08.493 --> 37:12.293
He has a smile on his face.

37:15.998 --> 37:17.530
You were gonna run?

37:17.532 --> 37:19.031
You were willing
to risk

37:19.033 --> 37:20.432
Your entire career,

37:20.434 --> 37:23.768
Your future?
For my family, absolutely.

37:23.770 --> 37:25.970
You can't run forever, okay?
This has to stop.

37:25.972 --> 37:27.838
The way it stops is for you

37:27.840 --> 37:29.906
And your mom to testify
before that tribunal.

37:31.843 --> 37:33.776
(sighs)

37:39.082 --> 37:41.148
(phone rings)

37:42.117 --> 37:43.549
Yeah, eric.

37:43.551 --> 37:47.419
Uh, lapd just responded to
the residence of walter brown,

37:47.421 --> 37:49.321
Catalina's driver,

37:49.322 --> 37:51.222
The one deeks replaced.
He was found beaten.

37:51.224 --> 37:54.458
Did your driver ever drop you
off at this apartment?

37:54.460 --> 37:56.992
Yeah. All the time.

38:00.130 --> 38:02.296
Callen?

38:02.298 --> 38:05.432
Our grupo patria guy and three
other men just showed up outside

38:05.434 --> 38:07.500
The apartment building.

38:07.502 --> 38:10.402
We're about
to have some visitors.

38:21.113 --> 38:23.246
Eric:
Sam, cruz's men
are in the apartment building.

38:23.248 --> 38:24.981
They're on their way up.

38:24.983 --> 38:27.583
We got the front door,
another exit in the kitchen.

38:27.585 --> 38:29.885
Both lead
to the hallway.
We try and escape,

38:29.887 --> 38:31.353
We're gonna run into the gunmen.

38:31.355 --> 38:33.355
If we stay here,
it's gonna be a bloodbath.
(sighs)

38:33.357 --> 38:35.090
We got to split up.
I'll make a run for it.

38:35.092 --> 38:36.491
Hopefully I can draw two of them
on me.

38:36.493 --> 38:38.025
Catalina:
They won't follow you.

38:38.027 --> 38:39.526
They're after me.
I'll go with you.
No.

38:39.528 --> 38:41.494
I can't let
you do that.

38:41.496 --> 38:42.862
You've already risked enough
for me.

38:42.864 --> 38:45.064
And I would risk even more.

38:45.066 --> 38:47.533
You're my baby
brother, gabriel.

38:47.535 --> 38:50.435
It's my job to
protect you.

38:52.572 --> 38:54.872
You better run fast.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.506
You better cover me.

38:58.343 --> 39:02.144
Callen, sam, they're
right outside your door.

39:19.462 --> 39:21.061
On three. One...

39:21.063 --> 39:21.861
Go, g!

39:21.863 --> 39:23.495
...Two...

39:23.497 --> 39:24.162
Three.

39:33.373 --> 39:35.439
Down, down, down.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.419
(automatic gunfire continues)

39:53.323 --> 39:54.955
Don't do it! Stay back!

39:55.524 --> 39:57.557
(shouts)

39:58.526 --> 40:01.260
(panting)

40:01.262 --> 40:02.995
My mother taught me to shoot.

40:02.997 --> 40:05.430
Why doesn't that surprise me?

40:05.432 --> 40:08.433
Follow me.

40:09.402 --> 40:11.468
(panting)

40:18.209 --> 40:20.309
(gunshots continue)

40:25.682 --> 40:26.981
(clicking)

40:27.950 --> 40:29.015
I'm out.

40:29.017 --> 40:30.383
What do we do now?

40:31.686 --> 40:34.486
When I say "run," run.

40:38.391 --> 40:40.457
Â¶ Â¶

40:47.565 --> 40:48.564
Callen:
Run!

40:48.566 --> 40:49.631
(grunting)

41:10.687 --> 41:13.487
(tires screeching)

41:15.624 --> 41:16.688
(grunts)

41:20.326 --> 41:22.726
(panting)

41:22.728 --> 41:24.394
(whistles)

41:28.333 --> 41:29.632
Thanks.

41:29.634 --> 41:31.533
No problem.

41:36.138 --> 41:37.570
(exhales)

41:44.745 --> 41:47.746
So, is elmslie getting along
with his star witnesses?

41:47.748 --> 41:50.715
He got what he came
for. The tribunal's

41:50.717 --> 41:52.416
Already issued a warrant
for silva's arrest,

41:52.418 --> 41:53.984
And the peruvian government
expects

41:53.986 --> 41:56.319
To have him in custody
by morning.
It may

41:56.321 --> 41:59.121
Have taken almost 20 years, but
it's good to see justice done.

41:59.123 --> 42:00.455
As a wise bottle of soap

42:00.457 --> 42:02.457
Once told me, "don't be a face.

42:02.459 --> 42:03.624
Be a force."

42:03.626 --> 42:04.758
I think
we can all

42:04.760 --> 42:06.760
Learn a little something
from that.

42:06.762 --> 42:07.761
The hell's he talking about?

42:07.763 --> 42:09.295
I don't know.
All I know

42:09.297 --> 42:10.763
Is that face wash
is changing my life.

42:10.765 --> 42:12.498
You want to feel this?
No.

42:12.499 --> 42:14.232
So silky smooth.
I don't want
to touch your face, deeks.

42:14.235 --> 42:15.767
Hetty:
If you leave now,

42:15.769 --> 42:17.769
You'll miss the slideshow.

42:17.771 --> 42:19.270
What slideshow?
The prints

42:19.272 --> 42:21.605
