00:15.190 --> 00:18.120
( <i>bell ringing )</i>

00:22.900 --> 00:24.710
( <i>whistle blowing )</i>

00:37.420 --> 00:42.390
( <i>playing free jazz )</i>

01:03.410 --> 01:04.680
D-oh!

01:04.739 --> 01:05.440
( screams )

01:19.760 --> 01:21.160
I don't need
your crummy job,
Mister Employer.

01:21.230 --> 01:22.600
I won the lottery!

01:22.660 --> 01:25.230
Well, who needs employees?
I won the lottery too!

01:25.300 --> 01:27.370
We both won the lottery!

01:27.430 --> 01:29.690
Why don't you
win the lottery too?

01:31.370 --> 01:33.710
Where everybody wins!

01:33.770 --> 01:36.370
Actual odds of winning:
one in 380 million.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.580
The lottery--

01:37.640 --> 01:40.770
exploiter of the poor
and ignorant.

01:40.850 --> 01:45.320
You know, I heard the jackpot's
up to $130 million.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.210
( <i>sputtering )</i>

01:46.290 --> 01:48.260
$130 million?

01:48.320 --> 01:50.460
Did you say $130 million?

01:50.520 --> 01:51.450
Yeah.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.450
Wow!

01:52.520 --> 01:54.720
( <i>clamoring )</i>

01:59.570 --> 02:01.100
Yes, yes. Here's
your lottery ticket.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.300
Thank you for knocking over
my inventory.

02:03.370 --> 02:04.610
Please, come again.

02:04.670 --> 02:06.410
Bart, I need
some lucky numbers fast.

02:06.470 --> 02:07.440
How old are you?

02:07.510 --> 02:08.410
Uh-huh, and
what's your birthday?

02:08.470 --> 02:09.300
No kidding.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.380
And what's Lisa's birthday?

02:11.440 --> 02:15.510
What? You don't know
your sister's birthday?
What kind of brother are you?

02:15.580 --> 02:17.390
Strap on
your bulletproof vest, Sanjay.

02:17.450 --> 02:19.390
It's time
for another bank run.

02:19.450 --> 02:20.590
Alright, but if
I don't make it

02:20.650 --> 02:22.480
promise you won't
sleep with my wife.

02:22.550 --> 02:24.120
I promise nothing.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.320
You'll never guess
what happened, Marge.

02:27.390 --> 02:28.490
Are you ready?

02:28.560 --> 02:33.230
I have a feeling
that we may win...

02:33.300 --> 02:34.770
the lottery!

02:34.830 --> 02:36.590
But we never, ever...

02:36.670 --> 02:39.440
I know you're excited,
but calm down and listen
to me carefully.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.540
Go get all your money...

02:41.610 --> 02:42.910
I buy one lottery ticket a week

02:42.980 --> 02:44.810
with the girls
at the hair salon.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.820
We each play our birthday,
and that's enough excitement
for me.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.850
You don't understand, Marge.
The lottery is the
one ray of hope

02:51.920 --> 02:54.890
in my otherwise
unbearable life!

02:54.950 --> 02:57.120
Uh, the lottery
and you.

02:57.190 --> 02:59.360
We're on a tight budget, here.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.560
Promise me you won't
get carried away.

03:01.630 --> 03:03.360
Yes, money... I mean honey.

03:03.430 --> 03:06.130
Ooh! Here comes the news
about the lottery.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.600
Hey, down in front.

03:07.670 --> 03:11.810
The whole state is suddenly
in the grip of lottery fever

03:11.870 --> 03:14.780
<i>and Springfield is no
exception.</i>

03:14.840 --> 03:18.310
<i>In fact, every copy
of Shirley Jackson's
The Lottery</i>

03:18.380 --> 03:20.650
<i>has been checked out
from the Springfield
Public Library.</i>

03:20.710 --> 03:22.970
Of course, the book does not
contain any hints on
how to win the lottery.

03:23.050 --> 03:25.750
It is rather a chilling tale
of conformity gone mad.

03:25.820 --> 03:27.660
Ohh....

03:29.760 --> 03:31.260
But there's already
one big winner--

03:31.320 --> 03:32.720
our state school system

03:32.790 --> 03:34.560
which gets fully
half the profits
from the lottery.

03:34.630 --> 03:36.660
Just think what we can buy
with that money:

03:36.730 --> 03:39.170
History books that know
how the Korean War came out.

03:39.230 --> 03:42.300
Math books that don't have
that Base-6 crap in them.

03:42.370 --> 03:44.040
And a state-of-the-art
detention hall

03:44.100 --> 03:47.600
where children are held in place
with magnets.

03:47.670 --> 03:50.300
Magnets--
always with the magnets.

03:55.780 --> 04:00.190
Homer:
I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.990
I am going to <i>win this lottery.</i>

04:03.060 --> 04:06.190
Homer, the odds
are 380 million to one.

04:06.260 --> 04:10.300
Correction: 380 million to 50!

04:10.360 --> 04:13.060
So, what are you gonna do
with your share of the money,
kids?

04:13.130 --> 04:14.070
Put it in
the bank.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.490
Give it to the poor.

04:15.570 --> 04:17.810
Pfft. What do kids know
about spending money?

04:17.870 --> 04:18.839
What are you
gonna do, Homer?

04:18.899 --> 04:19.959
Hmm...

04:21.839 --> 04:25.480
Hey Homer, what did you do,
get a haircut or something?

04:25.540 --> 04:28.070
( <i>booming voice: )
Look closer, Lenny.</i>

04:28.150 --> 04:31.090
Oh, I know what it is..
you're the biggest man
in the world now

04:31.150 --> 04:33.120
and you're covered
in gold.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.860
14 karat gold.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.060
Take a hike, boss.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.950
I'm running things now.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.820
All hail King Homer.

04:41.890 --> 04:45.060
( <i>triumphant laughter )</i>

04:49.570 --> 04:53.170
( <i>chuckling )</i>

04:55.270 --> 04:57.940
We now take you
to the drawing live.

04:58.010 --> 04:59.780
I hope you've got
<i>your tickets. I've got mine.</i>

04:59.850 --> 05:01.850
They're about
to start, Chief.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.780
No, you got
the wrong number.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.650
This is 91... 2.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.360
We'll be with you
in a minute, kids.

05:09.420 --> 05:12.190
This could be our ticket
out of here, Mel.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.930
I will now draw
the first winning number.

05:14.990 --> 05:16.250
( <i>groaning )</i>

05:16.330 --> 05:20.230
I've got so many tickets
I can't lose.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.600
<i>The first number is 17.</i>

05:22.670 --> 05:23.540
D-ohhh!

05:23.600 --> 05:24.910
You can still
win some money

05:24.970 --> 05:26.070
if you have
five out of six.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.380
Woo-hoo!

05:27.440 --> 05:29.580
<i>And the second number
is... three.</i>

05:29.640 --> 05:30.550
D-ohhh!

05:32.010 --> 05:33.980
Yeah, I knew
we wouldn't win.

05:34.050 --> 05:36.650
Well, why didn't you
tell the rest of us?

05:36.720 --> 05:38.850
Why did you
keep it a secret!?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.590
If you were 17,
we'd be rich.

05:41.650 --> 05:45.780
But <i>no,
you had to be ten.</i>

05:45.860 --> 05:49.060
And the final number is... 49.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.270
38... 49..!

05:51.330 --> 05:53.730
Oh, my God... I won.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.900
I won!

05:54.970 --> 05:56.000
( <i>screaming )</i>

05:56.070 --> 05:58.340
( <i>crazed laughter )</i>

05:58.400 --> 05:59.760
( <i>clearing throat )</i>

05:59.840 --> 06:01.080
Recapping our day's top story:

06:01.140 --> 06:02.980
the winner of today's
state lottery is...

06:03.040 --> 06:06.080
me, Kent Brockman.

06:06.140 --> 06:07.470
Can we get a shot of me?

06:07.550 --> 06:08.980
There you go.

06:09.050 --> 06:11.490
In other news, uh...

06:11.550 --> 06:13.750
A tragic mix-up
today in Cleveland.

06:13.820 --> 06:16.460
Many people killed. Uh...

06:17.890 --> 06:21.200
Good-bye!

06:21.260 --> 06:23.460
Oh, well,
we lost the money

06:23.530 --> 06:25.770
but at least we've
still got each other.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.500
Hey, the dog's dead.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.070
( <i>gasping )</i>

06:33.110 --> 06:34.910
Bart:
Grampa, he's not dead.

06:34.970 --> 06:37.770
Homer:
Dad, you shouldn't say
the dog's dead when he's not.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.910
It's not fair to toy
with people's emotions
like that.

06:40.980 --> 06:42.050
He <i>is dead.</i>

06:42.110 --> 06:43.310
I'll get a shovel.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.490
Well, he's not dead,
but he is awfully sick.

06:46.550 --> 06:49.820
Oh, sure,
the old man's off his rocker.

06:49.890 --> 06:53.060
If Grampa says he's dead,
he <i>must be alive.</i>

06:53.130 --> 06:53.930
He is alive.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.790
He's wagging his tail.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.500
That don't mean nothin'!
Dogs wag their tails
for hours after they die.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.690
I'm tired
of this conversation.

07:01.770 --> 07:02.840
Let's talk
about something else.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.210
I'm going home.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.080
Clear.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.800
Clear.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.950
Doctor, he's gone.

07:16.010 --> 07:20.340
Ugh! This is the part
of the job I hate.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.520
You did the best
you could.

07:23.590 --> 07:24.890
I love animals.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.460
I spend my life saving them,
and they can't thank me.

07:28.530 --> 07:30.130
Well, the parrots can,
but anyway,

07:30.200 --> 07:31.970
let's see what's wrong
with this little fellow.

07:33.570 --> 07:35.340
( <i>whimpering )</i>

07:35.400 --> 07:37.000
Hmm...

07:37.070 --> 07:40.440
I'm afraid that your dog
has a twisted stomach.

07:40.510 --> 07:42.380
He needs an operation
to correct it

07:42.440 --> 07:44.450
or he'll die.
( dramatic music )

07:44.510 --> 07:46.250
How much
will it cost?

07:46.310 --> 07:48.180
Seven hundred and fifty
dollars.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.180
Oh, dear.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.850
This is never an easy decision.
It's an awful lot of money.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.860
Well, I guess
we'll have to talk it over.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.860
Talk what over?
What's there
to talk about?

07:57.920 --> 08:00.050
What are we going
to talk over?

08:00.130 --> 08:02.900
Mr. Teeny needs a refill
of his nicotine gum.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.000
I can't help but notice
we're leaving the hospital.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.890
When's the dog going to get
his operation?

08:07.970 --> 08:10.500
Uh... later.
First I want to tell you

08:10.570 --> 08:12.570
about the most
wonderful place

08:12.640 --> 08:13.570
in the world--

08:13.640 --> 08:15.580
Doggie Heaven.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.150
In Doggie Heaven,
there's mountains of bones

08:18.210 --> 08:19.910
and you can't turn around

08:19.980 --> 08:22.520
without sniffing
another dog's butt.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.390
<i>And all the best dogs
are there--</i>

08:24.450 --> 08:27.760
Old Yeller
and about eight Lassies, and-

08:27.820 --> 08:29.120
Is there a doggie hell?

08:29.190 --> 08:31.090
Well, of course,
there couldn't be

08:31.160 --> 08:32.230
a heaven if there
weren't a hell.

08:32.289 --> 08:33.059
Who's in there?

08:33.130 --> 08:34.760
Oh... Hitler's dog

08:34.830 --> 08:38.000
and that dog Nixon had,
what's his name? Chester?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.690
Checkers.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.440
<i>Yeah...One of the Lassies'
is in there too.</i>

08:42.500 --> 08:45.440
The mean one--
the one that mauled Timmy.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.670
Wait a minute, does this
have anything to do with
Santa's Little Helper?

08:48.740 --> 08:51.880
Oh, honey,
$750 is a lot of money.

08:51.940 --> 08:55.070
We really can't afford
this operation.

08:55.150 --> 08:56.580
You're gonna just let him die?

08:56.650 --> 08:58.190
I know you're upset.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.750
Darn right I'm upset!

08:59.820 --> 09:02.060
Bart, watch your language.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.990
Oh... you did. Sorry.

09:04.060 --> 09:07.160
You're not going to let
our dog die, and that's it!

09:07.230 --> 09:09.760
Lousy, dog-killing
son-of-a...

09:09.830 --> 09:10.930
( <i>sighing )</i>

09:11.000 --> 09:13.070
Well, it will be okay.

09:13.130 --> 09:15.100
We'll get him
a new dog--

09:15.170 --> 09:17.640
one with
an untwistable stomach.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.630
( <i>whimpering )</i>

09:20.710 --> 09:22.340
Oh, come on. I'm sorry

09:22.410 --> 09:26.850
but we just can't afford it.

09:26.910 --> 09:29.180
Marge, make him stop.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.750
Oh!

09:30.820 --> 09:32.790
All right, all right,
we'll find a way.

09:32.850 --> 09:34.990
Lousy, manipulative dog.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.350
<i>Uh, Mr. Burns</i>

09:36.420 --> 09:37.890
I need to borrow some money.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.930
Please, do go on.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.700
Homer:
I know you're
a good man

09:42.760 --> 09:45.400
and I have a dog
that's very sick.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.490
Oh, please, continue.

09:47.570 --> 09:49.500
I thought maybe you...

09:49.570 --> 09:51.240
Oh.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.170
Well, thanks
for your time.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.740
What makes a man
endanger his job

09:56.810 --> 09:59.950
and, yes, even his life
by asking <i>me for money?</i>

10:00.010 --> 10:02.250
People like dogs,
Mr. Burns.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.910
Nonsense. Dogs are idiots.
Think about it, Smithers,

10:05.980 --> 10:07.980
If I came into your house

10:08.050 --> 10:10.310
and started sniffing
at your crotch

10:10.390 --> 10:11.360
and slobbering
all over your face

10:11.420 --> 10:12.380
what would you say?

10:12.460 --> 10:14.300
If <i>you did it, Sir?</i>

10:14.360 --> 10:18.330
Exactly.
You'd be fit to be tied.
Dogs!

10:18.400 --> 10:20.070
Hmm...

10:20.130 --> 10:21.740
No!
What?

10:21.800 --> 10:23.970
You are not
going to perform
that operation yourself.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.070
But Marge, it looks so easy.

10:26.140 --> 10:27.740
Just like carving a turkey.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.450
Oh! Oh!

10:32.510 --> 10:34.180
Bart:
Eww!

10:35.310 --> 10:38.210
Maybe you're right, Marge.

10:40.490 --> 10:43.460
I found a way
we can pay for the operation.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.360
Both:
All right!

10:44.420 --> 10:45.850
Hear that, boy?

10:45.920 --> 10:48.450
- What do you got, Marge,
insurance scam?
- No.

10:48.530 --> 10:49.930
I'm afraid we're
just going

10:50.000 --> 10:52.200
to have to make
a few sacrifices.

10:52.260 --> 10:56.360
Homer, you're going to have
to give up beer for a while.

10:56.430 --> 10:59.460
<i>Bart, from now on,
you'll have to get
your hair cut for free</i>

10:59.540 --> 11:01.280
<i>at Springfield
Barber College.</i>

11:01.340 --> 11:02.880
<i>No problemo.</i>

11:02.940 --> 11:05.350
I'm going to give up
my weekly lottery ticket

11:05.410 --> 11:07.620
and I found a way to stretch
the food budget.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.380
Fried chicken night
will now be organ meat night.

11:10.450 --> 11:13.590
Ham night will be spam night,
and pork chop night...

11:13.650 --> 11:14.360
( <i>sobbing )</i>

11:14.420 --> 11:15.520
will be chub night.

11:15.590 --> 11:17.930
I don't even know what that is.

11:17.990 --> 11:18.990
Lisa, I'm afraid

11:19.060 --> 11:21.060
we'll have to stop getting you

11:21.130 --> 11:24.670
<i>those volumes of
Encyclopedia Generica
from the grocery store.</i>

11:24.730 --> 11:26.430
But Mom, next week is
volume four--

11:26.500 --> 11:28.540
Copernicus
through Elephantiasis.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.140
We all have
to make sacrifices, dear.

11:31.200 --> 11:35.170
Maggie's baby clothes will have
to last for a little longer.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.740
Marge, I've figured out

11:36.810 --> 11:39.750
an alternative
to giving up my beer.

11:39.810 --> 11:43.420
Basically, we become a family
of traveling acrobats.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.150
I don't think
you've thought this through.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.850
Good news, Mr. Danielson.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.590
We saved your gamecock

11:54.660 --> 11:56.900
but I'm afraid
he'll never
fight again.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.400
That's what you think.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.260
He'll fight and he'll win.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.170
Clamp.

12:07.540 --> 12:08.880

12:16.350 --> 12:19.050

12:19.120 --> 12:20.420
<i>Come on now.</i>

12:20.490 --> 12:21.760

12:40.040 --> 12:42.680
Oh, Santa's Little Helper,
you're alive!

12:42.740 --> 12:44.710
We were so worried
about you.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.250
It's times like this

12:46.310 --> 12:48.620
I'm glad I flunked
out of dental school.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.820
Homer:
Lousy chub night.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.380
Hey, how come

12:53.450 --> 12:55.390
he gets meat
and we don't?

12:55.450 --> 12:57.410
You wouldn't want
what he's eating.

12:57.490 --> 12:59.230
It's mostly
snouts and entrails.

12:59.290 --> 13:02.630
Mmm... snouts.

13:02.690 --> 13:04.150
Yes, I'm back.

13:04.230 --> 13:05.770
Kent Brockman
is not the kind of man

13:05.830 --> 13:07.300
who would leave
a $500,000-a-year job

13:07.370 --> 13:09.640
just because
he won a lottery.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.610
Hey, I'm a journalist.

13:11.670 --> 13:14.310
He's got all the money
in the world

13:14.370 --> 13:16.800
but there's one thing
he can't buy.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.110
What's that?

13:18.180 --> 13:20.210
A dinosaur.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.620
Of course, I'm not the
only one who benefitted from
last week's big payoff.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.650
Our state schools got
their share too.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.090
Here, lottery officials present
Springfield Elementary

13:28.150 --> 13:29.550
with a brand-new eraser.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.720
One eraser?

13:30.790 --> 13:32.990
I'm used to my government
betraying me.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.400
I was in 'Nam.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.560
I served for 3...

13:35.630 --> 13:37.600
And speaking of lotteries

13:37.660 --> 13:41.690
here are the winning numbers
for this week's $40,000
'jackpot'.

13:41.770 --> 13:45.510
3-6-17-18-22 and 29.

13:45.570 --> 13:47.010
Oh, no!

13:47.070 --> 13:48.610
Those are my numbers.

13:48.670 --> 13:52.140
If it wasn't for that dog,
I would have won.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.980
Class, for tomorrow, I want you
to write a report

13:55.050 --> 13:56.980
