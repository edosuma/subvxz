10:24.891 --> 10:25.957
- Okay, salon.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.325
- We can have
little glam parties.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.059
- Love it.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.194
Candiace,
I love this room.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.529
- Thank you. I'm trying to
figure out paint in here.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.998
It's gonna look better
than this.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.033
Stuff is taking
six months to come.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.200
- Yeah.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.368
- I'm surprised
we got a couch.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.470
It just got here.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.971
Can we show you
a special room?

10:40.007 --> 10:42.557
- Yes. Oh, special room,
okay, yes.

10:42.592 --> 10:46.928
[laughing]

10:46.980 --> 10:49.097
- this is--
this is the guest room,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.932
aka, dot's room.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.219
- Is that a life-size
version of your mama?

10:54.254 --> 10:55.520
- It is.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.322
- Does she sleep with this
looking at her?

10:57.357 --> 10:58.490
- She loves it.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.575
Mm-hmm.
Pray for me.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.577
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

11:02.612 --> 11:06.114
- Let's see chris'
favorite room, the kitchen.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.450
- That's this room.
- Okay, I like.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.251
- Yes.
- Where is the chef?

11:10.287 --> 11:11.336
Did he know I was comin'?
- And he--

11:11.371 --> 11:14.255
- he knows I'm greedy.
- I saw him sneak in here.

11:14.291 --> 11:17.125
I squeezed some
grapefruit juice for us

11:17.177 --> 11:18.960
if you wanna have
a mimosa.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.429
- Oh, okay, I love that.
I would love a mimosa.

11:21.465 --> 11:23.348
- You would?
- Okay.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.283
- You can sit
wherever you like.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.085
- I'm loving this
big ol' couch.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.386
- I know.
Isn't it nice?

11:28.421 --> 11:30.689
- Y'all-- y'all do nasty things
on this couch, don't you?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.607
- Well, you know,
there is a large mirror here.

11:32.642 --> 11:34.275
- You should. Mmm.
- This is my--

11:34.311 --> 11:37.445
my howard university
mba notebook.

11:37.481 --> 11:39.430
- Okay, let's start
from the beginning.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.732
I thought you was done
with the masters.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.369
- We'll put this back here. No.
This is my second semester.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.938
- Oh, wow. Hi.
- So-- oh, there you are.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.289
- Hi.
- I've been asking about you.

11:48.325 --> 11:50.108
- Oh, you missed me?
- Yes.
- Yes.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.493
She was looking for snacks
'cause she's-- yeah.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.161
- Oh, let--
let me get my apron,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.046
and I'll get right on it.
- Thank you.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.332
Now, by the way,
what is he doing?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.967
Is he still doing
his, like, online?

11:59.002 --> 12:00.919
- He still does
the online cooking,

12:00.954 --> 12:02.554
teaching courses.
- Nice.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.590
- He plays golf.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.125
Oh, this is nice, babe.
- Here, look,

12:07.144 --> 12:08.326
and you got little picks,
so you don't even

12:08.361 --> 12:09.461
have to, like--
- thank you.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.662
- And that didn't even
take long.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.430
- Oh, no, I was--
yeah, pre-cut.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.532
- You're amazing.
- I try.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.034
- Thank you, honey.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.102
- This is nice.

12:17.137 --> 12:20.155
So many wonderful things
happening for candi-pants.

12:20.190 --> 12:21.022
- Yeah.
- That's good. Nice.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.657
- Yeah, but how is life?

12:22.692 --> 12:24.993
How is the relationship
with you and jamal right now?

12:25.028 --> 12:27.612
- Um, it's not good.

12:31.034 --> 12:32.083
- Coming up next...

12:32.119 --> 12:34.536
- You wanna talk about
your fiery box is on fire,

12:34.588 --> 12:36.171
and that's why you can't
keep a man?

12:36.206 --> 12:39.257
You're a broken whore
from hampton university,

12:39.292 --> 12:41.226
and everybody knows it.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.648
- So, how is the
relationship with you

12:46.683 --> 12:47.932
and jamal right now?
How are y'all doing?

12:47.967 --> 12:48.900
How is life?

12:48.935 --> 12:53.071
- Um, life is, like,
day to day right now.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.074
It's not good.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.242
It's just too much pandemic.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.526
- You're gonna break up
with him?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.862
- I do feel like
it would be nice

13:00.914 --> 13:02.847
if somebody lived eight minutes
down the road,

13:02.883 --> 13:04.165
not eight states away.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.500
- Yeah.
- And, like, 2020,

13:05.535 --> 13:08.620
we only saw each other,
like, once a month.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.488
He's not like us.
Like, we live in a bubble.

13:10.507 --> 13:14.826
He sees weekly,
like, 8,000 people.

13:14.845 --> 13:16.878
Like, he's around people.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.964
- Okay, but, like,
this is temporary,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.516
but when it's over,

13:21.551 --> 13:22.667
just, like--
- when is that?

13:22.686 --> 13:24.602
If I had a end date for that,
I would be, like, cool.

13:24.638 --> 13:28.273
- Well, there's-- we have
vaccines, and, you know,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.942
they're slowly trying
to work that out.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.443
- Yeah.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.196
- Covid of all things?

13:35.232 --> 13:38.867
The mountains they have
climbed as a couple--

13:38.902 --> 13:40.518
I don't believe it.

13:40.537 --> 13:41.953
Like, I think part
of the beauty

13:41.988 --> 13:44.205
of this relationship
with you guys,

13:44.241 --> 13:45.490
is that you know each other.
- True.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.325
- You know each other's
bumps and bruises.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.043
You know where
each other's moles are.

13:49.079 --> 13:49.861
- Yeah.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.363
- Blow it. Ha!

13:52.399 --> 13:54.215
[laughing]

13:56.219 --> 13:57.969
- you would have
to be getting to know

13:58.004 --> 13:59.971
a whole new person.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.973
That's-- that's, like,
who wants to do that?

14:02.008 --> 14:05.059
- Or, I could just be by
myself for a little while.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.596
- I wonder if that
very public embarrassment

14:08.648 --> 14:12.851
has anything to do with
why they're taking this break.

14:12.886 --> 14:16.054
- Is your relationship
real with jamal,

14:16.089 --> 14:19.657
or is it true that he had
another baby with another woman

14:19.693 --> 14:21.359
while he was dating you?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.027
- He has not.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.362
- He's been talkin'
to another woman,

14:24.397 --> 14:26.080
and it's clear conversations.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.032
I got 'em in my little
receipt book right here.

14:30.253 --> 14:32.253
- Oh, that's unfortunate.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.006
That was hard to watch.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.959
So, karen was
just talking crap.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.144
- Karen, the hater?

14:40.180 --> 14:42.013
- She's wildin'. Mm-hmm.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.350
I don't get it, which is
also why I'm over here.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.651
I don't wanna really talk.
I don't-- it's--

14:46.686 --> 14:48.353
I don't really have
a whole lot to day.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.187
- Okay.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.222
- I don't wanna
go there with karen.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.274
Like, I don't wanna
be angry in my life.

14:53.310 --> 14:56.311
I love karen like
a sister, like an auntie,

14:56.363 --> 14:59.230
and then you have
the rug of friendship

14:59.265 --> 15:00.982
just ripped from
underneath you, child.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.433
You don't recover.

15:02.452 --> 15:06.037
- So, f karen and everything
that she has said.

15:06.072 --> 15:13.628
♪♪

15:13.663 --> 15:16.915
- ray-ray, where'd
you go that fast, baby?

15:16.950 --> 15:20.051
I noticed that purging
has become my project.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.054
- Because everything that's
bein' purged is yours.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.089
- That's not true.
[chuckles]

15:25.124 --> 15:26.624
I have been goin'
through everything,

15:26.660 --> 15:29.310
and I'm trying to find,
baby, my wedding gown.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.629
I told rayvin, I promised her,
what I would do is,

15:31.665 --> 15:33.264
instead of making her
wear the gown,

15:33.299 --> 15:37.568
I would actually cut
a patch out of the gown.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.136
- Oh.
- So, that when
she gets married,

15:39.155 --> 15:42.073
she can have it sewn
into her gown.

15:42.108 --> 15:42.907
- Okay.

15:42.943 --> 15:43.808
- But I haven't been
able to find it.

15:43.827 --> 15:44.659
- It doesn't have
to be on the front.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.576
It can be, like,
under the gown

15:45.612 --> 15:47.445
if it doesn't go with it.
- Wait, why?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.080
What's wrong with
my 25-year-old gown

15:49.115 --> 15:50.214
in the front of her gown?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.950
[laughing]
- I can't imagine.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.337
- All right. Let's see
what else we can get rid of.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.171
- You wanna
sit down there?

15:57.207 --> 15:59.490
- Yeah, right
down there is fine.

15:59.509 --> 16:01.292
Speaking of miss rayvin,

16:01.328 --> 16:04.212
we had a conversation
the other night

16:04.264 --> 16:07.131
because I don't like
the taboo that goes

16:07.166 --> 16:08.716
with renewing your vows,

16:08.768 --> 16:10.218
doesn't have
a good track records,

16:10.270 --> 16:11.519
and she says,
"mom, why don't you

16:11.554 --> 16:14.389
"call it somethin' different?"
guess what she came up with.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.139
- Hmm?

16:15.174 --> 16:17.976
- So nice we had
to do it twice.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.193
[laughing]

16:19.229 --> 16:21.279
when ray asked me
to marry him last year,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.281
I was blown away
'cause we've gone through hell.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.616
- I got a 25th
anniversary comin' up,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.552
and we might a wedding
of our own.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.153
- All: Oh!

16:29.188 --> 16:31.355
- Twenty-five years, yes,
it's an institution.

16:31.374 --> 16:34.042
Some people ain't together
for 25 seconds.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.077
Some people can't get
the man out of the phone

16:36.129 --> 16:37.328
to show up in person.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.713
Jamal lives in your phone.
- He calls you all the time.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.081
- No, he-he
lives in my life.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.165
- He ain't here.

16:41.200 --> 16:41.966
Just sayin'.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.067
But the plan to
have the wedding,

16:43.103 --> 16:45.269
I want you to know,
I have looked at a few spots.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.137
- You're not gonna
do another, uh,

16:46.172 --> 16:48.072
one of your over the top
things, are you?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.058
You know how you--

16:50.093 --> 16:54.262
- do you have an objection
to my over the top?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.346
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Think about it, though.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.597
I thought about this.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.750
You remember you canceled
my first weddin' on me, right?

16:58.785 --> 17:01.052
Ray didn't actually
get cold feet.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.086
Ray got pissed off.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.522
I traveled without
letting him know initially,

17:04.557 --> 17:06.491
but he needed to know
where I was going

17:06.526 --> 17:09.077
before I packed my bags,

17:09.112 --> 17:10.194
and when I got
back to the house,

17:10.229 --> 17:11.729
he said,
"give me my ring."

17:11.748 --> 17:13.114
he took his ring back.
Yes, he did.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.532
Mm-hmm.

17:14.567 --> 17:19.170
- I have in mind that
we ceremoniously

17:19.205 --> 17:21.339
repeat our love
and affection.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.591
- Okay.
- Given the situation

17:23.626 --> 17:25.760
with the pandemic
and all that kinda stuff,

17:25.795 --> 17:29.097
you know, maybe do it
with less people.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.214
We're a little too old
for a wedding.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.466
- And our--
who is too old?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.051
Speak for yourself.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.387
[laughing]
you-- you old, ray.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.389
So, this tuxedo shirt,
we know it don't fit me.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.391
We sure know it
don't fit you, right?

17:40.426 --> 17:42.093
- Oh, yeah.
- Is that donate?

17:42.112 --> 17:44.262
- Donate.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.566
- I get what you're sayin',
babe, about nice, classy.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.734
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.669
- I'm only inviting women
out of my girlfriend circle

17:51.704 --> 17:53.454
that love us.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.873
Um, gizelle...

17:55.909 --> 17:57.475
Uh, gizelle
is not a friend.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.877
I had to really step back
and look at that.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.630
- Mmm.
- Because I held out hope
for so long.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.649
- I still have
a little hope for that.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.483
- Well, I-I don't.
- Yeah.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.518
- I mean, every time
I turn my back,

18:07.554 --> 18:11.589
she's saying something,
you know, negative about me.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.391
- Last year,
I did not bother karen

18:13.426 --> 18:14.642
in any way, shape,
or form.

18:14.677 --> 18:15.476
- Yeah.

18:15.512 --> 18:16.928
- I said she got
enough on her plate.

18:16.963 --> 18:17.762
- She was going through a lot.
- Her husband does not
love her,

18:17.797 --> 18:20.264

- Hi.

36:11.019 --> 36:13.687
- You might hear
some popping sounds.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.856
[back cracking]
- ooh!

36:15.908 --> 36:17.574
Reminds me of when
I first met ray.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.409
- Oh.
[laughing]

36:19.444 --> 36:22.662
- you know, I love it that
both are entrepreneurs,

36:22.698 --> 36:24.247
but we love
to play and have fun.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.148
- Oh, yes.

36:25.167 --> 36:26.750
- She shares ideas
about her business.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.835
She's a little quirky.
She's a total package.

36:28.871 --> 36:30.921
I can't wait for you
to meet wendy.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.672
- I'm glad she's welcoming me
with open arms.

36:32.708 --> 36:33.540
- She is.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.542
She was like,
"absolutely, bring her."

36:35.594 --> 36:37.994
I would like to
bring my friend.

36:38.013 --> 36:40.797
Her name is mia.
She's really cool.

36:40.832 --> 36:41.965
- Her name is mia?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.767
- Mm-hmm, is it okay?

36:45.053 --> 36:46.386
- All right, now.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.470
- I wish I could
tell you more,

36:47.505 --> 36:50.006
but I think we're gonna
experience wendy together.

36:50.025 --> 36:51.441
This-this--
- really?

36:51.476 --> 36:52.442
- Yes, we are.

36:52.477 --> 36:55.729
Wendy and I were able
to talk woman to woman

36:55.781 --> 36:57.397
and reset the button.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.848
I did not know you well enough.
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.867 --> 37:00.550
- We had too many people
interfering.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.652
- I just feel like we come
from different times.

37:05.540 --> 37:07.741
- I'm looking forward
to moving on.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.525
- Yes.
I'm here for it.

37:09.544 --> 37:13.880
- Wendy is a whole level
of a new person,

37:13.916 --> 37:15.865
but it's refreshing,
and it's so good.

37:15.884 --> 37:18.468
This is really my first time
coming here, too.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.753
I have not been
to her home.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.639
- Well, damn.
- But the ride--

37:22.674 --> 37:24.641
I don't know
how many miles this is.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.643
Over 100, right, one way?
- Honey,

37:26.678 --> 37:28.428
we should
have packed snacks.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.513
[laughing]

37:32.717 --> 37:33.883
[sighs]
- all right.

37:33.902 --> 37:35.685
Thank you for getting me
here safely.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.488
Oh, my god, there's
actual snow up here.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.090
[laughing]

37:40.125 --> 37:41.625
way up north.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.393
- Did-- were we supposed
to come at a different time?

37:43.412 --> 37:44.995
Like, where's the host?

37:45.831 --> 37:48.765
- Hi, I made it.
- Oh, you made it.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.067
- Oh, nice.
Thank you.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.636
- Okay, let me
take your coat.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.621
- Thank you.
I'm a little loaded down here.

37:54.673 --> 37:57.841
- Okay, that-- you--
that belly is hilarious to me.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.426
- You know.

[laughing]

38:04.916 --> 38:06.683
- I'll be down.
Thank you.

38:08.937 --> 38:10.020
- What the (bleep)
is happening?

38:10.055 --> 38:12.889
- I don't f'in' know.
- What the (bleep) is this?

38:12.924 --> 38:14.991
Wendy I don't wanna
see your striptease.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.759
- Oh, well, I'm into it.
Let's do it.

38:16.778 --> 38:17.811
Are you the special guest?

38:17.863 --> 38:18.895
- No.
- Right.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.563
- The special guests
are coming.

38:20.598 --> 38:22.699
- Is it strippers?
- It's not strippers.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.117
I'm so excited
to see you guys.

38:24.152 --> 38:25.485
- Where is everybody?

38:25.537 --> 38:26.603
- So, okay.
- Oh.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.121
- They're still
driving, actually.

38:28.156 --> 38:31.374
- Okay, but I got a call
from candiace.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.376
She says she's not coming.

38:39.718 --> 38:40.884
- Aww.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.552
- I mean, it's just--

38:42.587 --> 38:43.887
- I don't believe her.
- I feel like

38:43.922 --> 38:47.507
she might not want
to see karen just yet.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.676
She might not.
- Oh, you think that's
what it is?

38:49.728 --> 38:51.011
- I don't think she
thinkin' about karen

38:51.063 --> 38:52.462
like that at all.
- You don't think so?

38:52.481 --> 38:53.430
- No.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.898
- I don't know, child.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.151
- I can't wait for you
to meet everybody.

38:58.186 --> 39:00.020
I mean, I'm sure they're
excited to meet you, too.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.154
- I'm excited.

39:01.189 --> 39:03.406
- I'm most interested in seeing
how candiace is doin'.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.524
I haven't seen her
in a while.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.525
- Okay.
- So, my thing is,

39:05.577 --> 39:07.160
um, you know,
our relationship

39:07.195 --> 39:08.828
had been through a lot.

39:08.864 --> 39:11.081
So, I'm-I'm hoping
that it'll go

39:11.116 --> 39:12.615
in a positive direction.
- I-- you were telling me.

39:12.650 --> 39:13.783
This might be good
for you guys

39:13.818 --> 39:14.751
to get together.
- It might.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.086
Well, you know what?
This is wendy's party.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.153
- Right.
- So,

39:17.172 --> 39:19.789
what the most I'll do
is-is see where she's at.

39:19.824 --> 39:20.757
Take the temperature.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.709
- Yeah, okay.
- It takes time to get over.

39:22.761 --> 39:23.877
She went through a lot.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.678
She went through a lot.
- Okay.

39:25.714 --> 39:26.880
- You're gonna meet
gizelle tonight.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.631
She'll be there
because, again,

39:28.666 --> 39:30.683
um, wendy invited everyone.

39:30.719 --> 39:31.834
- Okay.
- I'll just say, you know,

39:31.853 --> 39:33.887
she has never
really received

39:33.939 --> 39:37.190

woman very warmly.

39:37.225 --> 39:40.110
- Yeah, okay.

towards you?

39:41.947 --> 39:43.113

39:49.788 --> 39:51.154

39:58.830 --> 39:59.712
It's not gonna fit.

39:59.748 --> 40:01.664

immediately.

40:58.306 --> 41:00.089
Matter of fact,
as soon as she saw me,

41:00.125 --> 41:01.141
she shoulda run up
to me and be like,

41:01.193 --> 41:03.059
"gizelle, you know what?
I'm sorry, I lost my mind.

43:01.212 --> 43:02.262
Is that right?
- Do the math.

43:02.314 --> 43:04.430
- You said your husband
is 38 years older than you.

43:04.482 --> 43:05.265
- Uh-huh.

43:05.317 --> 43:06.749
- So, you're saying
that he's 68.

43:06.785 --> 43:07.433
- Yeah.

43:07.485 --> 43:08.384
- So, that would
make you 30.

43:08.420 --> 43:11.154
- Oh, okay, no.
- Come on, mathematician.

43:11.189 --> 43:12.555
Come on, robyn.
[laughing]

43:12.574 --> 43:14.524
- so, he's 30 years older.

43:14.559 --> 43:15.325
- Oh.
- Right?

43:15.360 --> 43:17.226
I don't know, y'all.
- Oh, okay.

43:17.245 --> 43:19.128
- He's 68, and I'm 36.

43:19.164 --> 43:20.063
There we go.
- Got it.

43:20.098 --> 43:21.614
- So, 32 years.
- That would mean he's 32.

43:21.666 --> 43:22.498
- Do the math, 32.
- Thirty-two.

43:22.534 --> 43:25.585
- Okay.

43:25.620 --> 43:28.171
That's basic arithmetic.
M'kay.

43:28.206 --> 43:33.543
- She is a beautiful woman
but poor mia.

43:33.578 --> 43:35.144
With that being said,
I would like to welcome

43:35.180 --> 43:38.214
all you ladies
to "nude interlude" and--

43:38.249 --> 43:39.299
- I feel like we should
have music like...

43:39.351 --> 43:40.683
[humming]
[laughing]

43:40.719 --> 43:42.218
- somethin' sexy.
- No.

43:42.253 --> 43:43.386
- Oh.
- So, um,

43:43.421 --> 43:46.756
so, during the quarantine,
I have just spent some time

43:46.775 --> 43:49.559
thinking about wendy and
what wendy wants in her life

43:49.594 --> 43:51.311
and just gettin' to know me.

43:51.363 --> 43:54.597
I felt as though
there was a point in my life

43:54.616 --> 43:57.116
where I realized
I'm living for my children,

43:57.152 --> 43:58.768
and I'm not living for myself.
- Mmm.

43:58.787 --> 44:02.205
- And then after kam was--
I was done pumping with kam,

44:02.240 --> 44:05.158
I said to myself,
"what am I gonna do for me?"

44:05.210 --> 44:08.328
especially with kam,
all we did was pump, pump, pump.

44:08.380 --> 44:11.414
Because I have children,
and I can't do for me.

44:11.449 --> 44:12.782
I can't do--
"the nude interlude,"

44:12.801 --> 44:15.785
interlude is a period of time
in someone's life.

44:15.804 --> 44:18.721
Like-- like, not exag--
the first time

44:18.757 --> 44:22.325
I thought of myself and
said you're going to do this.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.628
I have been suppressing myself
in things I wanted for myself

44:25.647 --> 44:27.263
because of my children.

44:27.298 --> 44:28.815
So, I said it's time
that you do something

44:28.850 --> 44:31.801
for yourself and
something that makes you happy.

44:31.820 --> 44:35.304
- Just land the plane, wendy.
Wendy, land the plane!

44:35.323 --> 44:36.472
- Okay.

44:36.491 --> 44:39.208
- So, I want to introduce
you guys to my new friends,

44:39.244 --> 44:40.576
happiness.

44:40.612 --> 44:43.780
- Happiness?

44:45.650 --> 44:47.450
Wow!
- Oh, my god.

44:47.485 --> 44:48.835
- Let me see.

44:48.870 --> 44:51.754
- What? Wendy!
- Okay.

44:51.790 --> 44:54.156
- You got your boobs done?
- I love 'em.

44:54.175 --> 44:55.842
- What else you get done?
- Yes.

44:55.877 --> 44:57.844
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Let me see the butt.

44:57.879 --> 44:58.861
You got the butt done,
too, didn't you?

44:58.897 --> 45:00.296
- No.
- Let me see.

45:00.331 --> 45:01.881
- All right.
What did you get done?

45:03.234 --> 45:04.534
- Okay, go ahead.
- Oh!

45:04.569 --> 45:05.601
- Okay.

45:05.637 --> 45:06.686
- Yes.
- Oh, lord.

45:06.721 --> 45:08.388
- Okay.
- And I got some tweaks.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.389
- You got some what?
- Tweaks.

45:09.441 --> 45:10.189
- Tweaks?
- To what?

45:10.225 --> 45:11.274
- Okay, what did
you get tweaks to?

45:11.309 --> 45:13.726
- Hey.

45:13.778 --> 45:16.729
- Uh-uh.
I-I don't believe that.

45:16.781 --> 45:18.448
Girl, if you bring me here
to show me your boobs,

45:18.483 --> 45:20.199
you better show me your butt.

45:20.235 --> 45:21.784
- Just-- just some tweaks.

45:21.820 --> 45:23.653
- 'cause we all know
it wasn't nuttin'--

45:23.688 --> 45:25.455
nuttin' back there before.

45:25.490 --> 45:28.891
Wendy ain't had no booty,
and now...

45:28.927 --> 45:30.693
It's a little
somethin'-somethin' back there.

45:30.729 --> 45:31.544
[laughing]

45:31.579 --> 45:32.361
I think it's somethin'
on your face.

45:32.380 --> 45:33.730
- Yeah, it--
it looks refreshed.

45:33.765 --> 45:34.881
- You think so?
- Yeah.

45:34.916 --> 45:37.583
- Wendy been
refreshed, okay?

45:37.635 --> 45:39.385
When I was at lunch,
it was somethin' different

45:39.421 --> 45:40.603
about her face.

45:40.638 --> 45:43.806
Lookin' jazzy.
I like.

45:43.842 --> 45:46.642
- My life has changed
over quarantine.

45:46.678 --> 45:48.811
- Surely, we got
an injection somewhere,

45:48.847 --> 45:50.430
but, yeah, I wanna know
who your doctor is

45:50.482 --> 45:52.882
'cause I ain't mad at you.
Uh-uh.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.484
- Are you guys
ready to eat?

45:54.519 --> 45:56.819
- Yes.
- Okay, come.

45:56.855 --> 46:00.356
So, I have assigned seating
for you ladies.

46:00.391 --> 46:03.526
- So, when you wear
your things to class now,

46:03.561 --> 46:06.913
are you gonna wear things
that are gonna, like,

46:06.948 --> 46:08.915
cover it up a little bit?

46:08.950 --> 46:11.334
- So, like, if I wear
a cardigan, I look fine.

46:11.369 --> 46:12.668
If I wear a tee shirt,
I look fine.

46:12.704 --> 46:15.788
But if I wear this,
it pops.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.508
So, it allows me to pick
and choose when I wanna pop out.

46:18.543 --> 46:19.241
- Okay, good.

46:19.260 --> 46:21.511
- I can't stop
looking at them.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.379
- They're beautiful.
- I love 'em.

46:23.414 --> 46:24.797
- Okay, confidence
is everything.

46:24.849 --> 46:26.933
I'm feelin' it.
I can tell.

46:26.968 --> 46:29.919
- I want the girls to understand
I have many layers to me.

46:29.938 --> 46:31.954
I'm not just a doctor
or a professor.

46:31.990 --> 46:34.757
I can be smart,
beautiful, and sexy.

46:34.776 --> 46:37.293
- But is that all you had done,
were your boobs?

46:37.328 --> 46:39.428
- I had my boobs done,
and I had other tweaks.

46:39.447 --> 46:40.596
How about you?
What have you had done?

46:40.615 --> 46:41.764
- Oh, everything, honey.

46:45.653 --> 46:46.819
And I own it.

46:46.871 --> 46:47.737
- Okay, so,
what have you had done?

46:47.772 --> 46:48.938
- So, I get my botox
every four weeks.

46:48.957 --> 46:49.739
- Okay.
- I get fillers.

46:49.774 --> 46:51.507
I have my lips.
I have four boobs.

46:51.543 --> 46:53.376
I've had a tummy tuck.
I had abdominoplasty.

46:53.411 --> 46:54.544
I had my ass done.

46:54.579 --> 46:55.878
I mean, I can
continue to go on.

46:55.914 --> 46:57.580
- Yeah.
- And I'm okay with it.

46:57.615 --> 46:58.714
- Well, that's good.

46:58.750 --> 47:01.384
I haven't had those things
that you just named, but--

47:01.419 --> 47:02.318
but I think--
- what am I missing?

47:02.353 --> 47:05.287
I mean, I've even had
my clit worked on.

47:05.306 --> 47:07.356
- You did what, now?

47:10.795 --> 47:12.328
Coming up next...

47:12.363 --> 47:14.597
- We all know the ding dong
at her house is broken.

47:14.632 --> 47:17.567
- Gizelle, what you will not do,
is disrespect my husband

47:17.602 --> 47:19.902
when your ding dong is in
everybody else's vagina.

47:24.808 --> 47:26.075
- So, how about you?
What have you had done?

47:26.110 --> 47:26.876
- Oh, everything, honey.

47:26.911 --> 47:28.561
So, I get fillers.
I have my lips.

47:28.613 --> 47:30.213
I have four boobs.
I've had a tummy tuck.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.315
I had abdominoplasty.
I had my ass done.

47:32.350 --> 47:35.201
I even had my
clit worked on.

47:35.236 --> 47:39.855
- You did what, now?

47:39.874 --> 47:40.907
[chuckles]

47:40.959 --> 47:46.829
- okay, mia, girl,
I just met you.

47:46.865 --> 47:48.064
I don't ever wanna know

47:48.099 --> 47:49.749
what you got done
to your vagina.

47:49.801 --> 47:51.033
- Chef tia?
- Yeah.

47:51.052 --> 47:52.802
- I need another drink.

47:52.837 --> 47:57.740
Oh, girl, you done
got your cc done?

47:57.775 --> 48:01.227
Ooh, who was smashing that
or whom?

48:01.262 --> 48:03.012
- After you have children,
it's large,

48:03.047 --> 48:05.598
and you make it tiny.

48:05.650 --> 48:08.067
- That thing has
been beat to a pulp.

48:08.102 --> 48:11.854
That's really the only thing
I can deduce.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.055
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

48:13.091 --> 48:15.241
- How are you?
- How are you?

48:15.276 --> 48:16.725
- Good evening.
- Good.

48:16.744 --> 48:17.660
- Good evening.

48:17.695 --> 48:19.729
- Um, we're gonna start
you guys off with

48:19.764 --> 48:22.731
a coconut curry
cream of crab soup.

48:22.750 --> 48:23.499
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

48:23.534 --> 48:24.784
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

48:24.836 --> 48:26.102
- Thank you.

48:28.139 --> 48:29.922
- Where is candiace?
- Where is who?

48:29.958 --> 48:31.874
- Candiace.
- Oh, y'all weren't here.

48:31.909 --> 48:34.093
Candiace, she is sick.

48:34.128 --> 48:36.879
She called me literally
ten minutes before.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.180
I know.
- With what?

48:38.216 --> 48:40.249
- I don't know.
She don't know.

48:40.268 --> 48:43.603
- I think she didn't
wanna be here.

48:43.638 --> 48:45.955
Maybe she's not ready
to be in your presence.

48:45.990 --> 48:47.089
[chuckles]
I don't know.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.958
That's-- that's just me
being skeptical

48:48.993 --> 48:50.059
'cause I'm skeptical
of everyone.

48:50.094 --> 48:51.193
- Could be true.
- Yeah.

48:51.229 --> 48:53.279
I think you guys just need
a one-on-one to sit down.

48:53.314 --> 48:55.948
- Really?
- What do I know?

48:55.984 --> 48:58.284
- Well, I'm not gonna
ignore the fact that

48:58.319 --> 49:01.787
she was deeply hurt,
and she needs that time,

49:01.823 --> 49:03.306
and I have to respect
the process.

49:03.341 --> 49:04.490
- Right.

49:04.542 --> 49:08.311
- I value our friendship,
and it's worth a conversation.

49:08.346 --> 49:10.880
Now, for us to move forward,
I need to hear

49:10.915 --> 49:12.882
where candiace and I are

49:12.917 --> 49:16.118
so that I can move accordingly
and do my part.

49:16.154 --> 49:17.887
- When she can
speak for herself, you know,

49:17.922 --> 49:19.788
we can get to the bottom of it.
- Yeah, absolutely.

49:19.807 --> 49:20.823
- Don't take--
don't take my word for it.

49:20.858 --> 49:21.891
I'm just-- that's just me.
- No, no, but-- no.

49:21.926 --> 49:23.259
- It'd just be nice
to clear the air altogether.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.095
I don't know if we'll ever get
to a good place either, so...

49:26.130 --> 49:27.647
- Like, what's the issue
wit' y'all, rig now?

49:27.682 --> 49:28.681
- We just don't mesh.
- Okay.

49:28.733 --> 49:30.316
- I mean, I think
it's more so we don't align.

49:30.351 --> 49:31.901
- But that's okay, ashley.
Everybody doesn't.

49:31.936 --> 49:35.304
Everybody doesn't.
It's gonna take time.

49:35.323 --> 49:38.941
- My hope is that
we can be collectively

49:38.976 --> 49:40.943
in a great place because I--

49:40.978 --> 49:45.781
- that might be
a little difficult.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.249
- It's always good
to have goals, you know?

49:47.285 --> 49:48.150
- Yeah, yeah.

49:48.169 --> 49:49.919
- But why is that
gonna be difficult?

49:49.954 --> 49:51.921
- Well, we all know
I can't stand karen.

49:51.956 --> 49:54.156
So, that's gonna be--
- well, the feeling is mutual.

49:54.175 --> 49:57.843
- Me and drunk karen
will probably never be good.

49:57.879 --> 50:01.831
So, I have decided that
I'll just tell your truth,

50:01.866 --> 50:03.832
your whole truth
and nothing but it.

50:03.851 --> 50:04.767
- Gizelle,
you don't want this.

50:04.802 --> 50:06.102
- Your-your drunk truth.
- I'm telling you.

50:06.137 --> 50:07.937
You are a drunk.
- Your cheating truth.

50:07.972 --> 50:10.339
- And your hot box--
- your broke truth.

50:10.358 --> 50:12.191
- Shut up. Just shut up.
- She brought it on.

50:12.226 --> 50:13.809
I'll-I'll spread it out
over time.

50:13.844 --> 50:14.894
Don't worry.
- Gizelle, you know what?

50:14.946 --> 50:16.062
You are disgusting.
- I won't tell it all tonight.

50:16.114 --> 50:17.196
I'll spread it out.

50:17.231 --> 50:18.981
- You wanna talk about
your fiery box that's on fire,

50:19.017 --> 50:20.816
and that's why
you can't keep a man?

50:20.851 --> 50:22.184
Do you want to do that?

50:22.203 --> 50:25.287
- What's a fiery box?

50:25.323 --> 50:26.522
- Are you talkin' about
her cootchie on fire?

50:26.541 --> 50:30.076
- Oh, yes.

50:30.128 --> 50:32.378
Tell everybody what's going on
between them legs of yours,

50:32.413 --> 50:33.195
and that's why--

50:33.214 --> 50:34.246
- what are you,
her gynecologist?

50:34.298 --> 50:36.916
- Can we stick to the titties,
not the cootchie?

50:36.968 --> 50:39.301
- My hot box is called
the wap box, okay?

50:39.337 --> 50:42.805
And, karen, your box
is all the way dry.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.174
I'd take a wap box
over a dry box

50:45.209 --> 50:47.977
any day of the week, honey.
[snaps]

50:48.012 --> 50:49.745
she's obsessed
with my cootchie because

50:49.781 --> 50:52.114
