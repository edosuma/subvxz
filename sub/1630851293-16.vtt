STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

00:32.066 --> 00:33.466
BLANK VOID, THE WHITEST THING

00:33.533 --> 00:34.566
ON TV THIS WEEK, ASIDE FROM

00:34.633 --> 00:35.733
NANCY PELOSI DESPERATELY TRYING

00:35.800 --> 00:36.933
TO PRETEND SHE KNOWS THE WORDS

00:37.000 --> 00:38.633
TO "LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING."

00:38.700 --> 00:39.933
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.500
JUNETEENTH WAS DECLARED

00:41.566 --> 00:42.700
A FEDERAL HOLIDAY,

00:42.766 --> 00:44.133
THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD

OBAMACARE FOR THE 400th TIME,

VLADIMIR PUTIN, PROMPTING THIS

00:48.733 --> 00:51.366
UPLIFTING MOMENT:

01:05.200 --> 01:07.233
A MIRAGE OF IT ON THE HORIZON.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.233
>> John: WOW, THAT'S A DARK

01:08.300 --> 01:10.200
ANSWER.

01:10.266 --> 01:11.333
BUT I CAN'T SAY I EXPECTED

01:11.400 --> 01:12.300
ANYTHING LESS FROM A MAN

01:12.366 --> 01:13.500
WHOSE FACE SCREAMS,

01:13.566 --> 01:15.233
"I ENJOYED THE "JOKER" FILM."

01:15.300 --> 01:15.866
BECAUSE OF COURSE PUTIN DROPPED

01:15.933 --> 01:21.966
BLEAK TOLSTOY QUOTES.

01:22.033 --> 01:22.533
THAT'S VERY ON BRAND.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.466
IT WOULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE

01:23.533 --> 01:24.366
SHOCKING IF HE'D SAID,

01:24.433 --> 01:25.366
"FOLLOW YOUR BLISS," OR

01:25.433 --> 01:26.633
"IT'S WINE O'CLOCK SOMEWHERE" OR

01:26.700 --> 01:27.333
"NAVALNY, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR."

01:27.400 --> 01:28.100
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT,

01:28.166 --> 01:29.066
I WANT TO FOCUS ON JAPAN,

01:29.133 --> 01:30.266
THE COUNTRY WHICH GAVE THE WORLD

KARAOKE, THE BEST WAY TO LEARN

01:39.733 --> 01:40.600
TOKYO IS SET TO HOST

01:40.666 --> 01:42.533
THE OLYMPICS IN JUST A MONTH.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.133
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED

01:44.200 --> 01:47.033
TO TAKE PLACE LAST SUMMER, BUT

01:47.100 --> 01:48.300
DIDN'T, DUE TO...

01:48.366 --> 01:49.500
Y'KNOW.

01:49.566 --> 01:50.500
AND YET, DESPITE THE FACT THAT

01:50.566 --> 01:51.633
THE PANDEMIC IS STILL VERY MUCH

01:51.700 --> 01:53.100
NOT OVER, THE GAMES SEEM TO BE

01:53.166 --> 01:54.066
GOING AHEAD, AND NOT EVERYONE

01:54.133 --> 01:56.400
IN JAPAN IS THRILLED.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.000
>> TONIGHT, TOKYO OLYMPIC

01:58.066 --> 02:00.533
ORGANIZERS SAY THE GAMES ARE

02:00.600 --> 02:01.633
A GO, WITH MUSIC, MEDAL TRAYS,

02:01.700 --> 02:03.733
AND UNIFORMS.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.233
>> THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE

02:05.300 --> 02:09.166
GAMES GOING ON IS 100%.

02:09.233 --> 02:10.933
>> BUT POPULAR PROTESTS DEMAND

02:11.000 --> 02:12.100
THEY BE STOPPED,

02:12.166 --> 02:13.366
WITH SHIGARU OMI,

02:13.433 --> 02:15.200
JAPAN'S VERISON OF

02:15.266 --> 02:16.266
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, SAYING

02:16.333 --> 02:19.700
THE SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL.

02:19.766 --> 02:21.000
A DAILY DEATH RATE HIGHER THAN

02:21.066 --> 02:21.833
WHEN THE GAMES WERE DELAYED

02:21.900 --> 02:23.366
LAST YEAR.

02:23.433 --> 02:25.300
A SLOW VACCINE ROLLOUT.

02:25.366 --> 02:27.600
NOW WITH HALF A MILLION SHOTS

02:27.666 --> 02:28.866
EACH DAY, BUT THE TRUE TARGET

02:28.933 --> 02:30.666
TWICE THAT.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.900
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOOD!

02:31.966 --> 02:34.266
IN FACT, ONLY 6% OF THE JAPANESE

02:34.333 --> 02:35.400
POPULATION IS CURRENTLY FULLY

02:35.466 --> 02:37.066
VACCINATED.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.700
AND WHILE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:38.766 --> 02:40.100
THE TARGET PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE

02:40.166 --> 02:41.133
TO SAFELY HOST THE OLYMPICS,

02:41.200 --> 02:42.533
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT RIGHT NOW,

02:42.600 --> 02:43.400
IT SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN

02:43.466 --> 02:44.600
THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN THE

02:44.666 --> 02:46.266
"FAST AND FURIOUS" FRANCHISE.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.366
SO IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT

02:47.433 --> 02:48.900
POLLS HAVE SHOWN MANY OF

02:48.966 --> 02:50.366
THE JAPANESE PUBLIC OPPOSE

02:50.433 --> 02:52.066
HOLDING THE GAMES THIS YEAR.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.366
AND PERHAPS NO ONE REPRESENTS

02:54.433 --> 02:55.266
THAT SENTIMENT BETTER THAN THIS

02:55.333 --> 02:57.866
YOUTUBER:

02:57.933 --> 02:59.466
>> ALTHOUGH HOSPITALS ARE CLOSE

02:59.533 --> 03:00.833
TO COLLAPSE AND PEOPLE ARE

03:00.900 --> 03:02.400
EXPOSED TO RISK, IOC SAID THEY

03:02.466 --> 03:03.200
WILL, FOR SURE, HOLD THE

03:03.266 --> 03:03.900
OLYMPICS!

03:03.966 --> 03:05.300
IT'S CRAZY, ISN'T IT?

03:05.366 --> 03:07.433
THE IOC SAID, "TOKYO OLYMPICS

03:07.500 --> 03:09.966
WOULD GO AHEAD UNLESS STRUCK BY

03:10.033 --> 03:10.600
ARMAGEDDON."

03:10.666 --> 03:11.266
HMM.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.500
WHAT A JOKE!

03:12.566 --> 03:13.966
HA, HA, HA.

03:14.033 --> 03:15.233
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIT DOWN

03:15.300 --> 03:19.333
AND LISTEN TO AEROSMITH.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.133
>> John: THAT IS EXCELLENT.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.633
JUST TENS ACROSS THE BOARD.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.133
INEXPLICABLE SIDE DIVE: TEN.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.233
PLUGGING HIS EARS INSTEAD

03:25.300 --> 03:26.733
OF HIS NOSE: TEN.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.900
SHOUTING AN AEROSMITH LYRIC

03:27.966 --> 03:28.733
BEFORE HIS BODY IS CONSUMED

03:28.800 --> 03:29.866
BY A VERY SHALLOW LAGOON:

03:29.933 --> 03:31.733
TEN AGAIN.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.333
IF THE OLYMPICS SIMPLY HAVE TO

03:33.400 --> 03:34.633
HAPPEN, I WANT THAT GUY TO BE

03:34.700 --> 03:36.300
THE ENTIRE OPENING CEREMONY.

03:36.366 --> 03:38.366
JUST HIM, ALONE IN A STADIUM,

03:38.433 --> 03:39.966
SCREAMING AEROSMITH JOKES WHILE

03:40.033 --> 03:41.133
OCCASIONALLY JUMPING INTO WATER,

03:41.200 --> 03:43.066
FOR FOUR SOLID HOURS.

03:43.133 --> 03:45.433
I'D WATCH EVERY SECOND OF THAT.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.966
THE OLYMPICS GOING AHEAD IS

03:47.033 --> 03:47.933
UNDENIABLY RISKY, BUT THE

03:48.000 --> 03:49.266
ORGANIZERS SEEM TO BE

03:49.333 --> 03:50.666
CONSIDERING A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:50.733 --> 03:51.833
FACTORS, WITH MANY BEING

03:51.900 --> 03:53.033
FINANCIAL, ESPECIALLY AS JAPAN'S

03:53.100 --> 03:55.000
ALREADY OFFICIALLY SPENT OVER

03:55.066 --> 03:57.133
$15 BILLION ON THESE GAMES,

03:57.200 --> 03:59.900
WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITS

03:59.966 --> 04:00.766
SUGGESTING IT'S ACTUALLY

04:00.833 --> 04:02.100
TWICE THAT MUCH.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.000
AND THE TRUTH IS,

04:03.066 --> 04:03.933
EVEN IF JAPAN WANTED TO CANCEL,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.200
IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE.

04:06.266 --> 04:07.500
>> THE OLYMPIC HOST CITY

04:07.566 --> 04:09.366
CONTRACT SIGNED BETWEEN TOKYO

04:09.433 --> 04:11.733
AND THE IOC IN 2013 DOESN'T GIVE

04:11.800 --> 04:13.366
TOKYO THE POWER TO SCRAP THE

04:13.433 --> 04:14.933
GAMES.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.066
ONLY THE IOC HOLDS THAT RIGHT.

04:17.133 --> 04:18.633
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

04:18.700 --> 04:19.766
JAPAN DOESN'T TECHNICALLY HAVE

04:19.833 --> 04:21.033
THE AUTHORITY TO CANCEL THE

04:21.100 --> 04:23.433
GAMES, WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.800
IT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOUR CHILD

04:24.866 --> 04:26.400
GOT THE FLU AND YOU TRIED TO

04:26.466 --> 04:28.100
RESCHEDULE THEIR BIRTHDAY PARTY,

04:28.166 --> 04:29.000
ONLY TO GET OVERRULED BY THE

04:29.066 --> 04:29.900
CLOWN YOU HIRED.

04:29.966 --> 04:31.200
"HEY!

04:31.266 --> 04:32.433
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE GOT

04:32.500 --> 04:33.700
THE BUBONIC FUCKING PLAGUE,

04:33.766 --> 04:35.566
FROM 2:00 PM TO 5:00, YOU'RE ON

04:35.633 --> 04:37.566
BOZO'S CLOCK, BITCH."

04:37.633 --> 04:39.366
TO PROMOTE SAFETY AT THE GAMES,

04:39.433 --> 04:40.433
A TON OF PRECAUTIONS ARE BEING

04:40.500 --> 04:41.800
UNVEILED, FROM BARRING

04:41.866 --> 04:43.000
SPECTATORS FROM ABROAD,

04:43.066 --> 04:44.133
TO ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO KEEP A

04:44.200 --> 04:47.533
TWO-METER DISTANCE AT ALL TIMES,

04:47.600 --> 04:49.000
TO REQUESTING ATTENDEES SUPPORT

04:49.066 --> 04:51.266
ATHLETES BY CLAPPING INSTEAD OF

04:51.333 --> 04:52.733
SINGING OR CHANTING, WHICH IS A

04:52.800 --> 04:54.266
SHAME BECAUSE -- AS ANYONE WILL

04:54.333 --> 04:55.333
TELL YOU -- HALF THE FUN OF

04:55.400 --> 04:56.933
WATCHING THE MEN'S TRAMPOLINE

04:57.000 --> 04:58.266
FINAL IS THE RAUCOUS BONDING

04:58.333 --> 04:59.733
WITH YOUR FELLOW TRAMP-HEADS.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.766
AND WHILE SOME OF THOSE

05:01.833 --> 05:03.000
PRECAUTIONS WILL HOPEFULLY DO

05:03.066 --> 05:04.700
SOME GOOD, I WILL SAY, OTHERS

05:04.766 --> 05:07.000
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.333
>> OLYMPIC ORGANIZERS TYPICALLY

05:08.400 --> 05:10.100
GIVE AWAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

05:10.166 --> 05:10.766
CONDOMS DURING THE GAMES FOR ALL

05:10.833 --> 05:12.466
THE ATHLETES.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.866
BUT THIS YEAR THERE IS STILL

05:14.933 --> 05:16.566
GOING TO BE A CONDOM GIVEAWAY,

05:16.633 --> 05:17.666
BUT THEY ARE TELLING THE

05:17.733 --> 05:18.400
ATHLETES NOT TO USE THEM UNTIL

05:18.466 --> 05:20.433
THEY GET HOME.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.200
>> John: WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH

05:21.266 --> 05:22.333
THAT!

05:22.400 --> 05:23.433
HAVE FUN SELLING THAT MESSAGE

05:23.500 --> 05:25.033
AT THE THE CONDOM BOOTH.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.466
"HI THERE, 20-YEAR-OLD ADONIS

05:26.533 --> 05:27.033
WITH THE PHYSICAL STAMINA OF

05:27.100 --> 05:28.000
A YOUNG GAZELLE.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.566
WELCOME TO WHAT IS, ESSENTIALLY,

05:29.633 --> 05:30.766
A LIGHTLY MONITORED DORM FLOOR

05:30.833 --> 05:31.933
THAT YOU'LL BE SHARING WITH SOME

05:32.000 --> 05:33.466
OF THE MOST CHISELED BODIES ON

05:33.533 --> 05:34.266
THE PLANET, ALL OF WHOM YOU'LL

05:34.333 --> 05:35.200
LIKELY NEVER SEE AGAIN.

05:35.266 --> 05:37.033
HERE ARE SOME FREE CONDOMS!

05:37.100 --> 05:39.266
BUT PLEASE, MAKE SURE YOU THAT

05:39.333 --> 05:40.166
YOU SAVE THEM UNTIL -- AH, I SEE

05:40.233 --> 05:42.500
YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING.

05:42.566 --> 05:43.366
WELL, PLEASE, AT LEAST MOVE TO

05:43.433 --> 05:44.333
THE SIDE, THERE IS A LINE BEHIND

05:44.400 --> 05:45.533
YOU."

05:45.600 --> 05:47.000
BUT I GUESS IT'S GOOD NEWS THAT

05:47.066 --> 05:48.633
THEY'RE STILL HANDING THEM OUT,

05:48.700 --> 05:49.966
ESPECIALLY FOR JAPAN'S TOP

05:50.033 --> 05:51.500
CONDOM-MAKERS, WHO APPARENTLY

05:51.566 --> 05:52.666
SAW THE OLYMPICS AS AN EXTREMELY

05:52.733 --> 05:54.433
PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY TO LET

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
THE WORLD KNOW ABOUT JAPAN'S

05:55.566 --> 05:57.833
HIGH TECHNOLOGY PROPHYLACTICS.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.266
ALTHOUGH, I WILL SAY,

05:59.333 --> 06:00.066
I'M NOT CONVINCED THEY NEEDED

06:00.133 --> 06:02.266
THE OLYMPICS TO DO THAT.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.333
BECAUSE JAPANESE CONDOM ADS

06:03.400 --> 06:04.466
DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB SELLING

06:04.533 --> 06:06.300
THEIR PRODUCT.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.600
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

06:09.666 --> 06:10.900
>> THE CONDOM GORO FOUND WAS ONE

06:10.966 --> 06:12.300
OF LEGEND.

06:12.366 --> 06:13.366
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

06:13.433 --> 06:14.366
HOLY MOLY!

06:14.433 --> 06:15.400
GORO BECOMES A CONDOM BATTLER

06:15.466 --> 06:16.533
AGAINST HIS WILL.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.233
OMG!

06:17.300 --> 06:18.233
A CONDOM HUNTER!

06:18.300 --> 06:19.266
HA, HA!

06:19.333 --> 06:20.033
DOUBLING UP GAVE ME ULTIMATE

06:20.100 --> 06:21.066
ENDURANCE!

06:21.133 --> 06:22.200
I CAN LAST 13 HOURS!!!

06:22.266 --> 06:23.833
NO WAY!

06:23.900 --> 06:25.233
WATCH OUT!

06:25.300 --> 06:26.100
RUN, GORO!

06:26.166 --> 06:28.266
LOOK, HIS CONDOM RIPPED!

06:28.333 --> 06:29.833
WHOO-HOO!

06:29.900 --> 06:30.966
DON'T DOUBLE-BAG CONDOMS!

06:31.033 --> 06:33.233
THAT WAS CLOSE.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.433
GORO BEGINS HIS JOURNEY TO

06:34.500 --> 06:35.433
BECOME A CONDOM BATTLER,

06:35.500 --> 06:37.033
COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF

06:37.100 --> 06:40.800
THE CHALLENGES AHEAD.

06:40.866 --> 06:42.433
>> John: YES!

06:42.500 --> 06:43.533
THAT WAS PART OF AN ANIME

06:43.600 --> 06:45.600
WEB SERIES PRODUCED BY JAPAN'S

06:45.666 --> 06:46.633
LEADING CONDOM MANUFACTURER,

06:46.700 --> 06:47.966
OKAMOTO, IN WHICH A

06:48.033 --> 06:49.433
"CONDOM BATTLER" NAMED GORO

06:51.266 --> 06:53.033

06:53.100 --> 06:53.666

06:53.733 --> 06:54.600
HE WEARS WHILE BATTLING A BUNCH

06:54.666 --> 06:55.733

06:55.800 --> 06:58.233

06:58.300 --> 06:58.533

06:58.600 --> 06:59.900
CONTRACEPTION-THEMED, SCI-FI,

07:01.533 --> 07:02.666
COCK SOCKS ABOUT AN ANIME WAR IN

07:02.733 --> 07:04.000
WHICH THE DRESS CODE APPEARS TO

07:04.066 --> 07:05.200
BE "LATEX CASUAL," ALL OF WHICH

07:05.266 --> 07:06.833
THEY CLAIM IS "TO BE CONTINUED"

07:06.900 --> 07:07.900
-- OR, AS THE AD SAYS, "TO BE

07:07.966 --> 07:09.700
CONDOM."

07:09.766 --> 07:11.966
THAT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN

07:12.033 --> 07:13.766
SEX-ED IS HERE IN THE U.S.,

07:13.833 --> 07:15.266
WHERE IT'S USUALLY, "HERE'S A

07:15.333 --> 07:16.333
CONDOM, HERE'S A BANANA, LET'S

07:16.400 --> 07:20.433

07:20.500 --> 07:21.700
BUT THE FACT IS, DESPITE

07:21.766 --> 07:22.533

07:22.600 --> 07:24.000
THE OLYMPICS ARE GOING AHEAD.

07:24.066 --> 07:25.166
AND ALL OF THIS IS A GOOD

07:25.233 --> 07:26.400
REMINDER THAT HOSTING THE

07:26.466 --> 07:27.133

07:27.200 --> 07:28.733
A GOOD IDEA FOR A CITY.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800

07:29.866 --> 07:31.266
THE OLYMPICS TO BOOST TOURISM.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.966
IT'S JAPAN!

07:33.033 --> 07:35.866

09:49.733 --> 09:51.433
IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO

09:51.500 --> 09:52.733
PROVIDE LOW-INCOME HOMEOWNERS

09:52.800 --> 09:54.033
A WAY TO MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE

09:54.100 --> 09:54.833
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.

09:54.900 --> 09:59.066
AND TO EXPLAIN MORE,

09:59.133 --> 10:00.400
HERE IS NETFLIX'S VERY OWN,

10:00.466 --> 10:01.300
BARACK OBAMA:

10:01.366 --> 10:02.133
>> WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR

10:02.200 --> 10:03.300
AMERICAN HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE

10:03.366 --> 10:04.233
ADVANTAGE OF A NEW PROGRAM

10:04.300 --> 10:06.333
CALLED PACE.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.100

10:07.166 --> 10:09.433
IF YOU MAKE THE SWITCH TO SOLAR,

10:09.500 --> 10:11.100
YOU CAN NOW INSTALL SOLAR PANELS

10:11.166 --> 10:13.533
OR RETROFIT YOUR HOME TO MAKE IT

10:13.600 --> 10:16.033
MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AT NO

10:16.100 --> 10:17.700
UPFRONT COST, ALL BY PAYING FOR

10:17.766 --> 10:18.833
THEM THROUGH THE FUTURE SAVINGS

10:18.900 --> 10:20.400
ON YOUR ENERGY BILLS.

10:20.466 --> 10:22.433
>> John: WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE

10:22.500 --> 10:24.200
A GREAT PROGRAM FOR HOMEOWNERS!

10:24.266 --> 10:25.766
BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE UNDER THE

10:25.833 --> 10:28.466
AGE OF 35, LET ME QUICKLY CLEAR

10:28.533 --> 10:28.966
UP YOUR CONFUSION HERE:

10:29.033 --> 10:29.666
A "HOMEOWNER" IS A PERSON WHO

10:29.733 --> 10:30.966
OWNS THEIR HOME.

10:31.033 --> 10:32.066
THEY DON'T RENT IT.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.833
THE HOUSE BELONGS TO THEM.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.466
LIKE YOUR PARENTS -- YOU KNOW

10:34.533 --> 10:35.266
HOW YOUR PARENTS LIVE

10:35.333 --> 10:36.166
IN A HOUSE, BUT THEY DON'T

10:36.233 --> 10:36.866
HAVE A LANDLORD?

10:36.933 --> 10:37.766
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO SIGN

10:37.833 --> 10:38.500
A LEASE, AND THEY DON'T PAY

10:38.566 --> 10:39.266
A SECURITY DEPOSIT?

10:39.333 --> 10:40.133
IT'S LIKE THAT.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.633
IT'S THEIR HOUSE.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.933
DON'T WORRY, THOUGH -- THAT'LL

10:43.000 --> 10:43.800
NEVER BE YOU.

10:43.866 --> 10:45.366
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.533
AMERICA DECIDED A FEW YEARS BACK

10:46.600 --> 10:47.766
THAT IF YOU WERE BORN AFTER

10:47.833 --> 10:49.100
1985, YOU DON'T GET TO OWN A

10:49.166 --> 10:50.533
HOUSE.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.800
YOU DO GET TO RENT APARTMENTS

10:51.866 --> 10:52.933
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

10:53.000 --> 10:53.900
THOUGH, AS YOU GRADUALLY PAY OFF

10:53.966 --> 10:55.500
THE STUDENT LOANS FROM YOUR

10:55.566 --> 10:56.766
LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE -- THAT'S

10:56.833 --> 10:58.666
THE THING YOU GET TO DO.

10:58.733 --> 10:59.766
SO IF YOU'RE UNDER 35, YOU CAN

10:59.833 --> 11:01.100
ACTUALLY SKIP THIS STORY.

11:01.166 --> 11:02.866
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.233
GO FIGHT WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD ON

11:04.300 --> 11:04.866
TIKTOK ABOUT THE COOLEST WAY TO

11:04.933 --> 11:06.566
PART YOUR HAIR.

11:06.633 --> 11:07.733
YOUR LIFE IS SAD,

11:07.800 --> 11:12.000
AND THAT'S OKAY.

11:12.066 --> 11:14.866
PACE, THOUGH, STANDS FOR

11:14.933 --> 11:15.800
"PROPERTY ASSESSED

11:15.866 --> 11:16.900
CLEAN ENERGY,"

11:16.966 --> 11:18.266
AND THE IDEA ORIGINATED IN

11:18.333 --> 11:22.000
CALIFORNIA AS THE BRAINCHILD OF

11:22.066 --> 11:23.633
THE FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE

11:23.700 --> 11:26.000
MAYOR OF BERKELEY WHO DESCRIBES

11:26.066 --> 11:26.633
HIMSELF AS AN "CAPITALIST

11:26.700 --> 11:27.033
HIPPIE."

11:27.100 --> 11:27.866
WHICH ABSOLUTELY TRACKS FOR

11:27.933 --> 11:28.700
A GUY WHOSE NAME SOUNDS LIKE

11:28.766 --> 11:29.633
HE'S ABOUT TO GENTRIFY JAZZ.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.533
THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO PACE

11:30.600 --> 11:32.400
PROGRAMS: ONE FOR COMMERCIAL

11:32.466 --> 11:33.033
PROPERTIES AND ONE FOR

11:33.100 --> 11:33.766
RESIDENTIAL ONES.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.433
AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

11:35.500 --> 11:36.733
SECOND ONE, WHERE THERE ARE SOME

11:36.800 --> 11:38.400
HUGE PROBLEMS.

11:38.466 --> 11:40.100
BECAUSE AFTER A TRIAL RUN IN

11:40.166 --> 11:41.300
BERKELEY, THE RESIDENTIAL PACE

11:41.366 --> 11:42.633
PROGRAM EXPLODED ACROSS

11:42.700 --> 11:44.033
CALIFORNIA.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.866
IN JUST THE SECOND HALF OF 2014,

11:45.933 --> 11:47.000
LENDERS ISSUED $148 MILLION IN

11:47.066 --> 11:50.133
PACE LOANS.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.400
AND JUST A YEAR LATER, AS MORE

11:51.466 --> 11:52.600
COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE SIGNED

11:52.666 --> 11:54.100
ON, THAT NUMBER QUADRUPLED TO

11:54.166 --> 11:56.100
OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS.

11:56.166 --> 11:58.700
RIGHT NOW, THESE THREE STATES

11:58.766 --> 12:00.433
HAVE ACTIVE PACE PROGRAMS, BUT

12:00.500 --> 12:01.700
PLANS TO EXPAND TO OTHER STATES,

12:01.766 --> 12:03.400
INCLUDING NEW YORK AND OHIO,

12:03.466 --> 12:04.933
ARE VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.300
AND THAT SHOULD BE A CAUSE FOR

12:08.366 --> 12:10.266
REAL CONCERN, BECAUSE WHEN PACE

12:10.333 --> 12:11.400
LOANS GO WRONG, THEY CAN GO VERY

12:11.466 --> 12:12.833
WRONG.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.433
TAKE THIS CALIFORNIA COUPLE

12:14.500 --> 12:16.133
WHO ENDED UP LOSING THEIR HOME.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.466
AND THEY SAY THEIR PROBLEMS

12:17.533 --> 12:19.266
STARTED WHEN A CONTRACTOR TURNED

12:19.333 --> 12:20.833
UP AT THEIR HOUSE, PITCHING A

12:20.900 --> 12:23.133
PACE-FUNDED IMPROVEMENT.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
>> THEIR HOUSE BADLY NEEDED A

12:24.266 --> 12:25.666
NEW ROOF, SO THEY SIGNED UP.

12:25.733 --> 12:27.566
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS A WONDERFUL

12:27.633 --> 12:30.033
THING, JUST REALLY A GODSEND.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.100
>> ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER --

12:31.166 --> 12:33.100
>> ONCE HE SAW THE ROOF,

12:33.166 --> 12:34.366
HE SAYS, "WELL, LOOKS LIKE THIS

12:34.433 --> 12:34.700
WALL..."

12:34.766 --> 12:35.800
>> THEN IT WAS THE FLOOR.

12:35.866 --> 12:36.700
>> WELL, I THINK THERE'S SOME

12:36.766 --> 12:39.500
DAMAGE THERE.

12:39.566 --> 12:40.366
>> THEN A FEW MONTHS LATER --

12:40.433 --> 12:41.100
>> JUMPED OUR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS

12:41.166 --> 12:42.100
$600 A MONTH.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.566
>> OUR LIFE BEGAN TO UNRAVEL

12:43.633 --> 12:45.000
AT THAT VERY MOMENT.

12:45.066 --> 12:45.600
MY THOUGHT IS THAT WE'RE GOING

12:45.666 --> 12:47.000
TO WIND UP IN A TENT.

12:47.066 --> 12:47.900
>> John: LOOK, THERE ARE SOME

12:48.000 --> 12:50.433
SITUATIONS WHERE THE IDEA OF

12:50.500 --> 12:51.433
ENDING UP IN A TENT IS EXCITING

12:51.500 --> 12:52.966
-- IF YOU'RE GOING CAMPING,

12:53.033 --> 12:53.566
FOR EXAMPLE, OR SEEING

12:53.633 --> 12:55.000
THE CIRCUS, OR WALKING INTO

12:55.066 --> 12:56.333
THE FOREST TO FINALLY ABANDON

12:56.400 --> 12:57.866
SOCIETY FOREVER AND LIVE AMONG

12:57.933 --> 12:59.200
THE TREES, BUT IT SHOULDN'T

12:59.266 --> 13:00.266
REALLY BE THE DESIRED OUTCOME

13:00.333 --> 13:01.566
WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO FIX

13:01.633 --> 13:03.966
YOUR ROOF.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.166
UNFORTUNATELY, THE STORY OF PACE

13:06.233 --> 13:08.700
IS A CAUTIONARY TALE ABOUT HOW

13:08.766 --> 13:10.466
GOOD INTENTIONS, WHEN NOT PAIRED

13:10.533 --> 13:11.500
WITH CAREFUL, SMART DESIGN,

13:11.566 --> 13:13.600
CAN END IN DISASTER.

13:13.666 --> 13:14.900
AND GIVEN THAT JOE BIDEN

13:14.966 --> 13:15.866
PROMOTED THE PROGRAM AS

13:15.933 --> 13:17.400
VICE-PRESIDENT, AND PROMISED

13:17.466 --> 13:18.866
ON HIS CAMPAIGN WEBSITE TO

13:18.933 --> 13:20.133
"EXPAND THE UTILIZATION OF

13:20.200 --> 13:25.633
PACE," IT SEEMED THAT TONIGHT,

13:25.700 --> 13:27.266
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE

13:27.333 --> 13:28.033
A LOOK AT IT.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.033
AND LET'S START WITH HOW PACE

13:29.100 --> 13:29.933
WORKS.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.133
BECAUSE BASICALLY, IT'S MONEY

13:31.200 --> 13:31.666
DESIGNATED FOR REPAIRS OR

13:31.733 --> 13:32.233
UPGRADES TO YOUR HOUSE.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.900
THE AVERAGE PACE LOAN IS ABOUT

13:33.966 --> 13:36.000
$25,000, AND REPAYMENT PERIODS

13:36.066 --> 13:37.166
USUALLY STRETCH BETWEEN FIVE AND

13:37.233 --> 13:38.966
25 YEARS.

13:39.033 --> 13:42.066
BUT THE WAY YOU PAY IT BACK IS

13:42.133 --> 13:44.000
BOTH UNUSUAL AND VERY

13:44.066 --> 13:46.566
COMPLICATED -- EVEN THOUGH I'VE

13:46.633 --> 13:48.000
ALREADY CALLED IT A "LOAN," IT'S

13:48.066 --> 13:49.433
TECHNICALLY A LIEN ON YOUR HOUSE

13:49.500 --> 13:51.066
-- A KIND OF DEBT DIRECTLY

13:51.133 --> 13:52.133
ATTACHED TO YOUR PROPERTY,

13:52.200 --> 13:53.466
AND WHICH, IN THIS INSTANCE,

13:53.533 --> 13:54.733
YOU GRADUALLY PAY BACK THROUGH

13:54.800 --> 13:56.866
YOUR PROPERTY TAXES.

13:56.933 --> 13:57.900
AND ADS PROMOTING PACE HAVE

13:57.966 --> 13:58.866
LIKED TO PUT THAT FACT FRONT AND

13:58.933 --> 14:01.700
CENTER.

14:01.766 --> 14:03.266
>> YOUR HOUSE IS ACTUALLY

14:03.333 --> 14:04.366
BORROWING THE MONEY AND NOT YOU

14:04.433 --> 14:05.466
PERSONALLY.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.766
>> IT'S MORE LIKE THE HOUSE IS

14:07.833 --> 14:09.100
GETTING THE FINANCING BECAUSE

14:09.166 --> 14:09.833
PAYMENTS ARE MADE THROUGH AN

14:09.900 --> 14:10.533
ASSESSMENT ON YOUR PROPERTY

14:10.600 --> 14:11.900
TAXES.

14:11.966 --> 14:12.933
>> IT'S AS IF YOUR HOUSE

14:13.000 --> 14:13.866
IS BORROWING THE MONEY,

14:13.933 --> 14:15.333
NOT YOU PERSONALLY.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.300
>> John: OKAY, STOP.

14:16.366 --> 14:16.866
BECAUSE THERE'S AN OBVIOUS

14:16.933 --> 14:18.000
PROBLEM THERE.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.033
EVEN IF YOUR HOUSE IS

14:20.100 --> 14:22.033
TECHNICALLY BORROWING THE MONEY,

14:22.100 --> 14:22.666
THAT MONEY COMES IN THE FORM OF

14:22.733 --> 14:23.700
PROPERTY TAXES, AND YOU PAY FOR

14:23.766 --> 14:24.700
THOSE.

14:24.766 --> 14:26.100
YOUR HOUSE DOESN'T.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.666
BECAUSE HOUSES CAN'T PAY TAXES.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.833
BECAUSE HOUSES DON'T HAVE MONEY.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.900
BECAUSE THEY'RE HOUSES.

14:31.966 --> 14:33.733
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF BUYING

14:33.800 --> 14:34.633
A NEW SWEATER AND TELLING THE

14:34.700 --> 14:35.833
CASHIER, "OH, THE SALES TAX IS

14:35.900 --> 14:36.866
ON THE SWEATER, SO THE SWEATER

14:36.933 --> 14:38.400
WILL PAY THAT."

14:38.466 --> 14:39.433
THAT'S NOT HOW TAXES OR, INDEED,

14:39.500 --> 14:41.733
SWEATERS WORK.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.200
THOSE ADS ARE FROM PACE

14:43.266 --> 14:45.500
ADMINISTRATORS -- PRIVATE

14:45.566 --> 14:46.766
COMPANIES HIRED BY CITIES TO

14:46.833 --> 14:48.533
HANDLE THE LOGISTICS OF THE

14:48.600 --> 14:50.533
PROGRAM, INCLUDING PROVIDING

14:50.600 --> 14:52.633
FINANCING AND APPROVING LOANS.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.433
SOME OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS ARE

14:54.500 --> 14:55.900
THESE COMPANIES, THE LARGEST OF

14:55.966 --> 14:57.400
WHICH IS CALLED YGRENE.

14:57.466 --> 14:58.300
WHICH IS JUST OBJECTIVELY

14:58.366 --> 14:59.466
A STUPID NAME.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.266
IT SOUNDS LIKE A CONTEMPLATIVE

15:01.333 --> 15:02.700
JAZZ ALBUM FROM KERMIT THE FROG.

15:02.766 --> 15:04.500
BUT THE REAL ORIGIN OF THE NAME

15:04.566 --> 15:06.900
IS SOMEHOW EVEN STUPIDER,

15:06.966 --> 15:08.133
AS A YGRENE REPRESENTATIVE

15:08.200 --> 15:09.466
EXPLAINED DURING A LOCAL

15:09.533 --> 15:10.666
"SPONSORED CONTENT" SEGMENT:

15:10.733 --> 15:11.733
>> YGRENE, I LOVE THIS.

15:11.800 --> 15:12.666
IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER BECAUSE

15:12.733 --> 15:13.266
IT'S ACTUALLY "ENERGY" SPELLED

15:13.333 --> 15:14.000
BACKWARDS.

15:14.066 --> 15:15.333
>> EXACTLY.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.100
MOST PEOPLE DON'T FIGURE THAT

15:16.166 --> 15:16.666
OUT, BUT A COUPLE REMINDERS,

15:16.733 --> 15:18.366
THEY USUALLY GET IT.

15:18.433 --> 15:19.666
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE THEY

15:19.733 --> 15:21.233
GET IT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A HARD

15:21.300 --> 15:23.066
THING TO GET.

15:23.133 --> 15:24.433
YGRENE BASICALLY PUT ABOUT AS

15:24.500 --> 15:25.666
MUCH EFFORT INTO THEIR NAME AS

15:25.733 --> 15:26.400
"TRADING SPACES" PUT INTO PAM'S

15:26.466 --> 15:28.400
FAMILY ROOM.

15:28.466 --> 15:30.366
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FLAWS IN

15:30.433 --> 15:32.466
HOW PACE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED,

15:32.533 --> 15:34.200
AND HERE IS ONE OF THE FIRST KEY

15:34.266 --> 15:36.300
ISSUES: WHILE COMPANIES LIKE

15:36.366 --> 15:37.900
YGRENE MAY PROMOTE PACE THROUGH

15:37.966 --> 15:39.466
ADS AND SPONCON SEGMENTS,

15:39.533 --> 15:41.433
THE MAJORITY OF ACTUAL SALES TO

15:41.500 --> 15:43.833
CUSTOMERS ARE DONE BY INDIVIDUAL

15:43.900 --> 15:44.966
CONTRACTORS WHO'LL BE PERFORMING

15:45.033 --> 15:46.300
THE RENOVATIONS.

15:46.366 --> 15:47.133
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS

15:47.200 --> 15:48.566
FOR A MOMENT.

15:48.633 --> 15:49.566
THE PEOPLE WITH THE

15:49.633 --> 15:51.200
RESPONSIBILITY OF PITCHING

15:51.266 --> 15:53.000
A VERY COMPLICATED FINANCIAL

15:53.066 --> 15:54.933
PRODUCT -- A PSEUDO-LOAN THAT'S

15:55.000 --> 15:56.366
TECHNICALLY A TAX LIEN -- ARE

15:56.433 --> 15:57.300
CONTRACTORS, WHOSE TRAINING IS

15:57.366 --> 16:01.233
NOT IN FINANCE.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.300
NO JUDGMENT, IT'S JUST, PEOPLE

16:02.366 --> 16:03.433
ARE TRAINED FOR DIFFERENT

16:03.500 --> 16:04.466
THINGS.

16:04.533 --> 16:05.533
IT'S THE SAME REASON YOU DON'T

16:05.600 --> 16:06.666
ASK A BANKER TO RE-GROUT YOUR

16:06.733 --> 16:07.233
BATHROOM TILE.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.366
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A MESS.

16:09.433 --> 16:10.633
IN PRACTICE, THE WAY IT USUALLY

16:10.700 --> 16:12.333
WORKS IS, A CONTRACTOR WILL

16:12.400 --> 16:13.633
APPROACH YOU -- MAYBE OUTSIDE

16:13.700 --> 16:14.866
A SHOPPING CENTER, OR AT YOUR

16:14.933 --> 16:16.133
CHURCH, OR EVEN KNOCKING

16:16.200 --> 16:17.566
DIRECTLY ON YOUR DOOR.

16:17.633 --> 16:19.733
AND THEY'LL OFFER TO SELL YOU,

16:19.800 --> 16:21.933
LET'S SAY, SOLAR PANELS, OR A

16:22.000 --> 16:23.300
NEW AIR CONDITIONER, WITH THE

16:23.366 --> 16:26.100
PROMISE OF NO MONEY DOWN, AND

16:26.166 --> 16:27.333
THAT -- CRUCIALLY -- SHOULD PAY

16:27.400 --> 16:28.300
FOR THEMSELVES THROUGH HUGE

16:28.366 --> 16:30.500
FUTURE SAVINGS.

16:30.566 --> 16:31.600
THE THING IS, CONTRACTORS ARE

16:31.666 --> 16:33.166
NOT ALWAYS COMPLETELY STRAIGHT

16:33.233 --> 16:34.600
WITH CUSTOMERS ABOUT JUST HOW

16:34.666 --> 16:35.466
MUCH THEIR PROPERTY TAXES COULD

16:35.533 --> 16:36.766
GO UP.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.300
>> THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE.

16:38.366 --> 16:39.833
THEY SAID THAT I NEEDED THE

16:39.900 --> 16:40.966
SOLAR SYSTEM, THAT IT WAS GONNA

16:41.033 --> 16:41.866
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE MY LIGHT

16:41.933 --> 16:46.233
BILLS.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.200
WHEN MY PROPERTY TAXES CAME

16:47.266 --> 16:48.933
BACK IN NOVEMBER, I HAD --

16:49.000 --> 16:51.166
I WENT FROM $600 PROPERTY TAXES

16:51.233 --> 16:53.200
TO ALMOST $10,000 PROPERTY

16:53.266 --> 16:55.800
TAXES, WHICH I COULD NOT PAY.

16:55.866 --> 16:57.733
>> John: $600 TO $10,000.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.233
THAT IS NOT GOOD!

16:59.300 --> 17:00.933
THE ONLY TIME THE VALUE OF

17:01.000 --> 17:01.766
SOMETHING SHOULD CHANGE THAT

17:01.833 --> 17:03.500
DRAMATICALLY IS IF ELON MUSK

17:03.566 --> 17:04.933
SHITS OUT A TWEET ABOUT IT.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.833
WE TRULY LIVE IN THE BEST

17:05.900 --> 17:08.133
POSSIBLE SYSTEM!

17:08.200 --> 17:10.466
BUT ALSO, IT SEEMS PRETTY

17:10.533 --> 17:11.633
UNLIKELY SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING

17:11.700 --> 17:12.866
TO CUT HER ELECTRICITY BILL BY

17:12.933 --> 17:15.166
$10,000.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.700
IN FACT, FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT

17:16.766 --> 17:19.033
HOW PACE IMPROVEMENTS WILL PAY

17:19.100 --> 17:20.900
FOR THEMSELVES, THERE IS A

17:20.966 --> 17:21.800
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW THERE, AS THIS

17:21.866 --> 17:22.900
PROFESSOR WHO'S STUDIED THEM

17:22.966 --> 17:24.333
WILL TELL YOU:

17:24.400 --> 17:26.100
>> A FOUNDATIONAL FLAW OF THE

17:26.166 --> 17:27.700
PACE PROGRAM IS THAT THERE IS

17:27.766 --> 17:29.666
NO INDEPENDENT ENERGY AUDIT

17:29.733 --> 17:30.933
REQUIRED OF A HOME BEFORE

17:31.000 --> 17:32.566
HOME CONTRACTORS CAN START

17:32.633 --> 17:33.966
SUGGESTING ALL SORTS OF

17:34.033 --> 17:36.700
THINGS TO DO TO IT.

17:36.766 --> 17:38.400
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE MAYBE

17:38.466 --> 17:40.133
PUT IN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE,

17:40.200 --> 17:41.400
HIGH EFFICIENCY WINDOWS,

17:41.466 --> 17:42.233
EVEN THOUGH THE EXISTING WINDOWS

17:42.300 --> 17:42.800
ARE NOT THE MAIN SOURCE OF

17:42.866 --> 17:43.933
ENERGY WASTE.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.166
AND YOU WOULD DO MUCH BETTER

17:45.233 --> 17:47.000
JUST CAULKING A FEW LEAKS.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.800
>> John: EXACTLY.

17:49.866 --> 17:50.666
THERE IS NO INDEPENDENT PARTY

17:50.733 --> 17:51.933
REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER YOUR

17:52.000 --> 17:53.733
RENOVATIONS WOULD CUT CLOSE

17:53.800 --> 17:54.600
TO ENOUGH ENERGY COSTS TO BE

17:54.666 --> 17:55.966
WORTH IT.

17:56.033 --> 17:56.933
WHICH REALLY SEEMS LIKE

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
SOMETHING YOU'D WANT VERIFIED

17:58.066 --> 17:59.200
BY A THIRD PARTY.

17:59.266 --> 18:00.600
IT'S THE SAME REASON WE HAVE

18:00.666 --> 18:01.833
INDEPENDENT HEALTH INSPECTORS

18:01.900 --> 18:03.666
PUT A LETTER GRADE OUTSIDE

18:03.733 --> 18:05.100
A RESTAURANT, AS OPPOSED TO

18:05.166 --> 18:06.333
LETTING THE OWNER PUT UP HIS OWN

18:06.400 --> 18:06.866
SIGN THAT SAYS, "TRUST ME,

18:06.933 --> 18:08.500
IT'S CLEAN."

18:08.566 --> 18:10.566
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

18:10.633 --> 18:11.433
THE NEXT KEY QUIRK OF THE PACE

18:11.500 --> 18:12.866
PROGRAM.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.666
BECAUSE IF THOSE ENERGY SAVINGS

18:14.733 --> 18:16.100
DON'T COVER THE ADDITIONAL TAXES

18:16.166 --> 18:17.000
YOU INCUR, YOU COULD BE IN BIG

18:17.066 --> 18:19.866
TROUBLE.

18:19.933 --> 18:20.866
REMEMBER THOSE ADS ABOUT HOW

18:20.933 --> 18:21.933
"YOUR HOUSE PAYS FOR

18:22.033 --> 18:23.800
THE FINANCING, NOT YOU?"

18:23.866 --> 18:25.433
WHAT THAT MEANS IS,

18:25.500 --> 18:26.466
YOUR HOUSE IS NOW THE COLLATERAL

18:26.533 --> 18:28.766
FOR THE DEBT.

18:28.833 --> 18:29.400
SO IF THINGS GO WRONG,

18:29.466 --> 18:30.700
YOU COULD WELL LOSE YOUR HOME,

18:30.766 --> 18:32.466
AND, YOU KNOW, END UP IN A TENT.

18:32.533 --> 18:35.166
AND THERE ARE FAR FEWER

18:35.233 --> 18:35.833
PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT THAT THAN

18:35.900 --> 18:37.300
YOU MIGHT THINK.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.333
BECAUSE THIS IS A TAX LIEN

18:38.400 --> 18:40.266
RATHER THAN A LOAN,

18:40.333 --> 18:42.266
THE FINANCING ISN'T SUBJECT TO

18:42.333 --> 18:42.866
THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

18:42.933 --> 18:44.100
THAT YOU'D GET WITH A STANDARD

18:44.166 --> 18:46.366
HOME LOAN.

18:46.433 --> 18:47.766
SO FOR INSTANCE, IN FLORIDA,

18:47.833 --> 18:49.066
THE STATE DOESN'T REQUIRE

18:49.133 --> 18:52.333
PACE PROVIDERS TO EXPLAIN

18:52.400 --> 18:52.866
THE COSTS OF IMPROVEMENTS,

18:52.933 --> 18:53.700
CHECK IF THE PEOPLE WHO SIGN UP

18:53.766 --> 18:55.400
CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO PAY BACK

18:55.466 --> 18:56.833
THE MONEY, OR IF THEY EVEN

18:56.900 --> 18:59.400
UNDERSTAND THE TERMS.

18:59.466 --> 19:00.400
AND PACE ADMINISTRATORS WILL

19:00.466 --> 19:01.500
INSIST THEY DO ALL THOSE THINGS

19:01.566 --> 19:02.866
ANYWAY -- THAT THEY'RE DILIGENT

19:02.933 --> 19:04.300
ABOUT VETTING HOMEOWNERS,

19:04.366 --> 19:05.833
THE PROJECTS THEY TAKE ON,

19:05.900 --> 19:07.733
AND THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.600
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY EXAMPLES

19:09.666 --> 19:11.566
OF FAILURES TO DO THAT.

19:11.633 --> 19:15.833
THANKS TO PACE, ONE MISSOURI

19:15.900 --> 19:19.433
HOMEOWNER WOUND UP WITH

19:19.500 --> 19:20.933
$25,000 OF DEBT ON THE HOME THAT

19:21.000 --> 19:23.600
WAS APPRAISED BY THE CITY AT THE

19:23.666 --> 19:25.133
TIME ADDRESSED $8400.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.400
AND IF AT THIS POINT YOU'RE

19:27.466 --> 19:28.033
WONDERING WHY ON EARTH PEOPLE

19:28.100 --> 19:28.733
SIGN UP FOR THESE LOANS, IT'S

19:28.800 --> 19:29.400
BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN PRESENTED

19:29.466 --> 19:30.233
AS A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM -- ONE

19:30.300 --> 19:31.433
THAT, REMEMBER, PRESIDENT OBAMA

19:31.500 --> 19:33.066
PROMOTED -- WHICH MIGHT INSTILL

19:33.133 --> 19:35.400
A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.200
>> THEY DID MENTION A GOVERNMENT

19:37.266 --> 19:40.900
PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR

19:40.966 --> 19:42.266
GOVERNMENT, YOU THINK THIS IS AN

19:42.333 --> 19:45.066
AWESOME DEAL AND YOU DON'T

19:45.133 --> 19:46.100
EXPECT WHAT HAPPENED TO HAPPEN.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.133
>> IN A HIDDEN CAMERA

19:47.200 --> 19:49.000
INVESTIGATION LAST MAY,

19:49.066 --> 19:50.400
WE CAUGHT CONTRACTORS TOUTING

19:50.466 --> 19:52.666
CLAIMS OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.433
>> SO BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE

19:53.500 --> 19:55.366
GOING ON, THIS GOVERNMENT

19:55.433 --> 19:55.966
PROGRAM COULD ACTUALLY

19:56.033 --> 19:56.633
HELP YOU.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.833
>> OH, THAT IS A GOVERNMENT

19:57.900 --> 19:58.066
PROGRAM.

19:58.133 --> 19:59.633
>> YEAH.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.333
>> WHEN WE SHOWED UP,

20:00.400 --> 20:01.533
THE SALES PITCH WAS OVER.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.100
AND THEN THEY HAD SOME

20:02.166 --> 20:04.033
PARTING WORDS.

20:04.100 --> 20:08.366
>> YOU SUCK, BY THE WAY.

20:08.433 --> 20:09.533
>> John: LOOK: I'D SAY I FELT

20:09.600 --> 20:10.800
BAD FOR THAT REPORTER, WHO WAS

20:10.866 --> 20:11.566
CLEARLY JUST DOING HIS JOB AND

20:11.633 --> 20:12.700
WAS THEN MET WITH A MAN BERATING

20:12.766 --> 20:13.566
HIM FROM HIS COMPACT TOYOTA.

20:13.633 --> 20:14.700
BUT THINK OF IT THIS WAY --

20:14.766 --> 20:15.566
AT LEAST NOW HE KNOWS WHAT IT'S

20:15.633 --> 20:17.066
LIKE TO BE A WOMAN ON THE STREET

20:17.133 --> 20:17.866
WHO DOESN'T SMILE BACK.

20:17.933 --> 20:18.700
AND IF THIS IS ALL STARTING

20:18.766 --> 20:19.700
TO FEEL POTENTIALLY PREDATORY,

20:19.766 --> 20:21.133
THAT'S BECAUSE IT OFTEN IS.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.366
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

20:22.433 --> 20:23.266
THE HISTORY OF PREDATORY

20:23.333 --> 20:25.466
LENDING, IT WON'T REMOTELY

20:25.533 --> 20:29.433
SURPRISE YOU TO LEARN THAT

20:29.500 --> 20:31.200
AN ANALYSIS OF ONE OF THE

20:31.266 --> 20:32.266
LARGEST MARKETS FOR PACE IN

20:32.333 --> 20:33.433
FLORIDA FOUND THAT MANY OF THOSE

20:33.500 --> 20:34.700
WITH THE HIGHEST DEBT BURDENS

20:34.766 --> 20:36.100
UNDER PACE FINANCING WERE FOUND

20:36.166 --> 20:36.700
TO BE IN MAJORITY MINORITY

20:36.766 --> 20:37.500
ZONES.

20:37.566 --> 20:38.500
AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE,

20:38.566 --> 20:39.533
BECAUSE CONTRACTORS HAVE ALSO

20:39.600 --> 20:40.400
BEEN ACCUSED OF TARGETING

20:40.466 --> 20:41.500
NEIGHBORHOODS OF NON-ENGLISH

20:41.566 --> 20:42.700
SPEAKERS, SENIOR CITIZENS, AND

20:42.766 --> 20:45.466
EVEN THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL

20:45.533 --> 20:46.766
DISABILITIES, LIKE THIS MAN, WHO

20:46.833 --> 20:47.766
-- AS HIS LAWYER POINTS OUT --

20:47.833 --> 20:49.100
ABSOLUTELY DID NOT UNDERSTAND

20:49.166 --> 20:51.433
WHAT HE WAS SIGNING UP FOR.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.033
>> IT'S VERY APPARENT FROM

20:53.100 --> 20:54.600
SPEAKING WITH HIM THAT HE

20:54.666 --> 20:57.400
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THESE LOANS.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.133
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE

20:59.200 --> 21:00.666
CONTRACTS THAT HE ENTERED INTO.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.133
HE HAD KITCHEN REMODELING DONE

21:03.200 --> 21:04.800
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN COOK.

21:04.866 --> 21:06.666
HE GETS MEALS ON WHEELS.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.133
HE DOESN'T USE HIS KITCHEN.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.533
HE'S A NICE GUY, HE WANTS

21:09.600 --> 21:10.433
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.833
SO HE INVITES THEM IN, HE TALKS

21:12.900 --> 21:14.300
TO THEM, AND THEY TALK HIM INTO

21:14.366 --> 21:15.600
"HEY, YOU NEED THESE WINDOWS

21:15.666 --> 21:15.866
REPLACED.

21:15.933 --> 21:16.466
YOU NEED YOUR KITCHEN

21:16.533 --> 21:18.166
REMODELED."

21:18.233 --> 21:19.433
>> John: LOOK, I GET THAT YOU'RE

21:19.500 --> 21:20.666
ON HIS SIDE, AND I DO APPRECIATE

21:20.733 --> 21:22.600
THAT, BUT YOUR CLIENT IS SITTING

21:22.666 --> 21:23.566
RIGHT THERE!

21:23.633 --> 21:24.633
SOMEONE SHOULD, AT THE VERY

21:24.700 --> 21:26.366
LEAST, HAVE THOUGHT TO MOVE

21:26.433 --> 21:28.200
THAT INTERVIEW OUTSIDE.

21:28.266 --> 21:29.500
THE NUMBER ONE RULE OF TALKING

21:29.566 --> 21:31.133
ABOUT SOMEONE BEHIND THEIR BACK

21:31.200 --> 21:32.300
IS THAT THEIR BACK SHOULD NOT BE

21:32.366 --> 21:33.133
ANYWHERE IN YOUR IMMEDIATE

21:33.200 --> 21:35.500
VICINITY.

21:35.566 --> 21:37.233
AND COMPANIES ROUTINELY DEFEND

21:37.300 --> 21:39.000
THEMSELVES BY ARGUING THEY

21:39.066 --> 21:39.966
DISCLOSE EVERYTHING CLEARLY,

21:40.033 --> 21:41.466
AND THAT PEOPLE SIMPLY SHOULDN'T

21:41.533 --> 21:42.266
SIGN THESE CONTRACTS IF THEY

21:42.333 --> 21:43.400
CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEM.

21:43.466 --> 21:44.433
BUT THAT'S A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS

21:44.500 --> 21:47.433
WHEN THEIR WHOLE OPERATION SO

21:47.500 --> 21:49.066
OFTEN EMPHASIZES SPEED OVER

21:49.133 --> 21:50.566
SLOW, DELIBERATIVE

21:50.633 --> 21:51.466
CONSIDERATION.

21:51.533 --> 21:52.633
THESE COMPANIES' WEBSITES

21:52.700 --> 21:53.666
BRAG ABOUT THEIR "SUPER FAST

21:53.733 --> 21:55.066
APPROVALS," OR THEIR "SPEEDY

21:55.133 --> 21:56.733
APPROVAL PROCESS," OR MAKE

21:56.800 --> 21:59.000
CLAIMS LIKE, "GET APPROVED FOR

21:59.066 --> 21:59.800
YGRENE FINANCING IN 30 MINUTES

21:59.866 --> 22:01.400
OR LESS."

22:01.466 --> 22:03.700
AND THE CLEAR IMPLICATION THERE

22:03.766 --> 22:04.666
IS THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY GET

22:04.733 --> 22:10.766
YOUR MONEY LIKE THAT!

22:10.833 --> 22:11.066
OH, SHIT.

22:11.133 --> 22:15.400
>> OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

22:15.466 --> 22:16.500
>> John: I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

22:16.566 --> 22:17.666
I SNAPPED MY FINGERS WITHOUT

22:17.733 --> 22:17.933
THINKING.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.600
>> YOU KNOW I'M BUSY, RIGHT?

22:18.666 --> 22:19.633
>> John I DO.

22:19.700 --> 22:20.500
ACTUALLY, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO

22:20.566 --> 22:21.200
RIGHT NOW?

22:21.266 --> 22:22.100
ANYTHING FUN?

22:22.166 --> 22:23.100
FAIR ENOUGH.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.033
THE POINT IS, THOUGH, A COMMON

22:24.100 --> 22:25.000
SALES TACTIC HERE IS FAST

22:25.066 --> 22:25.700
APPROVALS.

22:25.766 --> 22:26.600
CONTRACTORS OFTEN GO

22:26.666 --> 22:27.600
DOOR-TO-DOOR WITH A TABLET,

22:27.666 --> 22:28.533
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SIGN

22:28.600 --> 22:29.300
ELECTRONICALLY.

22:29.366 --> 22:30.366
AND IN ONE COMPANY'S VIDEO,

22:30.433 --> 22:31.433
A CONTRACTOR TALKS OPENLY ABOUT

22:31.500 --> 22:32.833
JUST HOW FAST THE E-SIGN PROCESS

22:32.900 --> 22:34.900
IS.

22:34.966 --> 22:36.900
>> I JUST TAKE THE PEOPLE TO

22:36.966 --> 22:39.133
THE ADOPT AND SIGN PORTION OF

22:39.200 --> 22:40.666
IT, HAVE THEM PICK A SIGNATURE,

22:40.733 --> 22:41.800
AND SIGN ALL THE REMAINING

22:41.866 --> 22:42.566
PAGES, AND WE'RE DONE IN JUST

22:42.633 --> 22:43.633
A MATTER OF MINUTES.

22:43.700 --> 22:46.400
I WAS IN A HOUSE IN RIALTO.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.566
THE PATIO DOOR WAS OPEN BEHIND

22:47.633 --> 22:50.366
ME, THE RAIN WAS POURING,

22:50.433 --> 22:52.700
THE TV WAS ON LOUD, THREE DOGS

22:52.766 --> 22:53.966
BARKING, FOUR KIDS YELLING, AND

22:54.033 --> 22:55.033
WE GOT THROUGH IT.

22:55.100 --> 22:55.766
AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE

22:55.833 --> 22:57.666
ESIGN PROGRAM AFTER THAT.

22:57.733 --> 23:00.100
>> John: OH, I BET YOU DID!

23:00.166 --> 23:01.266
ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT SURE

23:01.333 --> 23:02.533
"LOOK HOW EASY IT WAS TO GET

23:02.600 --> 23:03.566
THIS STRESSED-OUT HOMEOWNER TO

23:03.633 --> 23:05.133
SIGN A LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT"

23:05.200 --> 23:06.466
IS QUITE THE FLEX HE THINKS

23:06.533 --> 23:07.633
IT IS.

23:07.700 --> 23:08.833
THERE ARE, INDEED, SEVERAL

23:08.900 --> 23:09.566
THINGS YOU CAN DO IN A MATTER OF

23:09.633 --> 23:10.200
MINUTES WHILE FOUR CHILDREN

23:10.266 --> 23:11.166
ARE SCREAMING AND THREE DOGS

23:11.233 --> 23:12.733
ARE BARKING IN THE BACKGROUND.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.466
YOU CAN SCHEDULE A GROCERY

23:14.533 --> 23:15.433
DELIVERY, OR HAVE A TENSE

23:15.500 --> 23:16.633
EYE CONTACT-ONLY ARGUMENT WITH

23:16.700 --> 23:18.433
YOUR SPOUSE, OR LIKE AN

23:18.500 --> 23:19.466
INSTAGRAM POST FROM

23:19.533 --> 23:21.200
AN EX ANNOUNCING THEY'RE

23:21.266 --> 23:23.166
"MAKING MUSIC NOW," THEN FIND

23:23.233 --> 23:25.166
THAT EX'S MUSIC ON SOUNDCLOUD,

23:25.233 --> 23:27.033
THEN SEND THAT EX'S NEW SONGS

23:27.100 --> 23:29.033
TO YOUR GROUP THREAD, THEN WATCH

23:29.100 --> 23:30.366
AS THEY MERCILESSLY TEAR TEVIS'S

23:30.433 --> 23:31.466
AMATEUR EDM TRACKS A NEW

23:31.533 --> 23:32.966
ASSHOLE.

23:33.033 --> 23:35.033
ALL OF THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED

23:35.100 --> 23:37.233
UNDER THOSE CHAOTIC

23:37.300 --> 23:39.300
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT SIGNING UP

23:39.366 --> 23:41.133
FOR A MASSIVE LIEN ON YOUR HOUSE

23:41.200 --> 23:41.833
FROM A GUY WHO'S IN LOVE WITH

23:41.900 --> 23:43.066
HIS iPAD PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.333
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T LIKE AGREEING

23:44.400 --> 23:45.300
TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

23:45.366 --> 23:47.400
AN iTUNES UPDATE.

23:47.466 --> 23:49.000
THIS IS LIKE SITTING ACROSS THE

23:49.066 --> 23:50.500
TABLE FROM A BANKER, POTENTIALLY

23:50.566 --> 23:52.100
SIGNING YOUR HOUSE AWAY.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.766
THE PROBLEMS IS THE INCENTIVES

23:54.833 --> 23:55.600
JUST AREN'T REALLY THERE FOR

23:55.666 --> 23:57.633
CONTRACTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT

23:57.700 --> 23:58.700
THE PEOPLE THEY'RE SELLING TO

23:58.766 --> 23:59.666
CAN ACTUALLY PAY BACK THE LOANS

23:59.733 --> 24:01.400
THEY'RE TAKING ON.

24:01.466 --> 24:02.933
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE, IN THE FINAL

24:03.000 --> 24:04.533
QUIRK OF THIS PROGRAM THAT MAKES

24:04.600 --> 24:07.733
IT SO DANGEROUS, THE PACE LOAN

24:07.800 --> 24:09.633
ISN'T JUST A LIEN ON YOUR HOUSE

24:09.700 --> 24:10.800
-- IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A

24:10.866 --> 24:12.333
"PRIORITY LIEN," MEANING THAT,

24:12.400 --> 24:13.866
IN THE EVENT OF A FORECLOSURE,

24:13.933 --> 24:16.100
PACE LENDERS GET TO COLLECT

24:16.166 --> 24:18.233
THEIR MONEY FIRST, AHEAD OF THE

24:18.300 --> 24:20.466
MORTGAGE LENDER OR ANYONE ELSE.

24:20.533 --> 24:22.366
THE FACT THAT THAT'S THE CASE

24:22.433 --> 24:23.300
ENABLES COMPANIES LIKE YGRENE

24:23.366 --> 24:25.100
TO BUNDLE THAT DEBT TOGETHER AND

24:25.166 --> 24:27.200
SELL IT ON WALL STREET AS A VERY

24:27.266 --> 24:29.366
SAFE INVESTMENT.

24:29.433 --> 24:30.800
BECAUSE FOR THOSE INVESTORS,

24:30.866 --> 24:32.000
IT'S A NEAR-GUARANTEED RETURN.

24:32.066 --> 24:32.966
BUT FOR HOMEOWNERS THEMSELVES,

24:33.033 --> 24:35.366
IT CAN SPELL COMPLETE DISASTER.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.766
FOR ONE THING, IT CAN MAKE IT

24:36.833 --> 24:39.533
MUCH HARDER TO SELL YOUR HOUSE.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.933
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO BUY A

24:41.000 --> 24:42.033
HOUSE WITH A LIEN ON IT FOR

24:42.100 --> 24:43.133
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

24:43.200 --> 24:43.833
FOR RENOVATIONS THAT MIGHT'VE

24:43.900 --> 24:45.966
BEEN DONE A DECADE AGO.

24:46.033 --> 24:47.566
IF YOU'RE HOUSE HUNTING AND YOU

24:47.633 --> 24:48.700
FIND THAT OUT, IT'S LIKE HEARING

24:48.766 --> 24:50.433
THE REALTOR SAY, "HERE'S THE

24:50.500 --> 24:51.566
GARAGE-SLASH-METH LAB," OR,

24:51.633 --> 24:52.900
"HERE'S THE BASEMENT WHERE THE

24:52.966 --> 24:54.400
KIDNAPPED KIDS WERE CHAINED UP,"

24:54.466 --> 24:55.333
OR "HERE ARE THE POPCORN

24:55.400 --> 24:56.133
CEILINGS."

24:56.200 --> 24:57.466
IT IMMEDIATELY KILLS ANY APPEAL

24:57.533 --> 24:59.533
THE HOUSE EVER HELD.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.066
AND IT'S NOT JUST HOMEOWNERS

25:01.133 --> 25:02.966
RAISING THE ALARM HERE.

25:03.033 --> 25:05.200
THAT PRIORITY LIEN PLACEMENT IS

25:05.266 --> 25:06.600
THE PRIMARY REASON WHY, IN 2010,

25:06.666 --> 25:08.100
FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC

25:08.166 --> 25:09.866
STOPPED BACKING MORTGAGES ON

25:09.933 --> 25:11.633
HOMES THAT HAD PACE LOANS.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.600
AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER

25:13.666 --> 25:15.400
A POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING

25:15.466 --> 25:16.500
CONSEQUENCE TO A SYSTEM WITH

25:16.566 --> 25:18.566
NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY BAKED IN.

25:18.633 --> 25:19.966
REMEMBER THAT CALIFORNIA COUPLE?

25:20.033 --> 25:22.200
HERE IS THEIR CONTRACTOR

25:22.266 --> 25:23.500
EXPLAINING WHY NONE OF WHAT

25:23.566 --> 25:25.266
HAPPENED TO THEM IS HIS FAULT.

25:25.333 --> 25:26.433
>> DID YOU AS A CONTRACTOR,

25:26.500 --> 25:27.900
THOUGH, EVER CONFIRM IF THEY HAD

25:27.966 --> 25:29.233
THE ABILITY TO PAY?

25:29.300 --> 25:31.566
BECAUSE THIS IS AN OLDER COUPLE

25:31.633 --> 25:32.533
ON FIXED INCOME, THEY SAY

25:32.600 --> 25:33.533
THERE'S NO WAY THEY COULD HAVE

25:33.600 --> 25:35.366
PAID FOR THE WORK THAT YOU TOOK

25:35.433 --> 25:36.800
ON IN THEIR HOUSE.

25:36.866 --> 25:37.933
>> BUT -- I DON'T QUALIFY

25:38.000 --> 25:38.566
PEOPLE.

25:38.633 --> 25:40.266
PACE QUALIFIES PEOPLE.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.300
>> WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF

25:41.366 --> 25:42.633
PASSING THE BUCK HERE BECAUSE --

25:42.700 --> 25:43.833
>> NO, THERE'S NO PASSING

25:43.900 --> 25:45.033
THE BUCK, MISS.

25:45.100 --> 25:46.766
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TALK TO

25:46.833 --> 25:47.366
YGRENE, WHO THEY HAD THE

25:47.433 --> 25:48.800
CONTRACT WITH.

25:48.866 --> 25:50.833
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON THERE.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.133
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY BOLD TO

25:52.200 --> 25:53.633
CLAIM "THERE'S NO PASSING THE

25:53.700 --> 25:54.733
BUCK," ONLY TO IMMEDIATELY THEN

25:54.800 --> 25:56.300
PASS THE BUCK.

25:56.366 --> 25:58.466
IT HEARKENS BACK TO THAT FAMOUS

25:58.533 --> 25:59.300
SIGN IN HARRY TRUMAN'S OFFICE,

25:59.366 --> 26:00.833
"THE BUCK STOPS HERE,

26:00.900 --> 26:02.133
WITH LARRY DOWN THE HALL,

26:02.200 --> 26:03.533
HE'S THE ONE WHO HANDLES

26:03.600 --> 26:04.433
ALL THE PAPERWORK, YOU SHOULD

26:04.500 --> 26:06.533
REALLY GO TALK TO HIM."

26:06.600 --> 26:08.066
THE POINT IS, EVERY PLAYER HERE

26:08.133 --> 26:10.066
IS PERPETUATING A CYCLE OF ZERO

26:10.133 --> 26:11.400
ACCOUNTABILITY.

26:11.466 --> 26:13.066
THE PACE ADMINISTRATORS BLAME

26:13.600 --> 26:15.033
THE CONTRACTORS BLAME THE

26:15.100 --> 26:16.333
ADMINISTRATORS.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
AND SOMETIMES, THE FINGER OF

26:17.466 --> 26:18.266
BLAME GETS POINTED DIRECTLY

26:18.333 --> 26:20.733
AT THE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.266
BECAUSE HERE'S WHERE, LEGALLY,

26:22.333 --> 26:23.500
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YGRENE

26:23.566 --> 26:25.300
-- WHICH IS ENERGY BACKWARDS,

26:25.366 --> 26:27.166
BY THE WAY, IT'S VERY CLEVER --

26:27.233 --> 26:29.833
INSISTS THAT THEY HAVE RIGOROUS

26:29.900 --> 26:31.400
DISCLOSURE PRACTICES, EXERCISE

26:31.466 --> 26:33.100
ROBUST OVERSIGHT OVER

26:33.166 --> 26:34.033
CONTRACTORS, AND HAVE NEVER

26:34.100 --> 26:39.633
PERSONALLY FORECLOSED ON A HOME.

26:39.700 --> 26:40.933
THEY ALSO INSIST THAT THE COUPLE

26:41.000 --> 26:41.233
RECEIVED

26:41.300 --> 26:42.666
ALL THE APPROPRIATE FINANCING

26:42.733 --> 26:43.433
DOCUMENTS, AND THAT THEY, AND

26:43.500 --> 26:44.700
NOT YGRENE, SELECTED THE

26:44.766 --> 26:45.433
CONTRACTORS TO WORK ON THEIR

26:45.500 --> 26:46.500
HOUSE.

26:46.566 --> 26:47.266
SORT OF IMPLYING THAT IT WAS ALL

26:47.333 --> 26:48.466
THEIR FAULT.

26:48.533 --> 26:49.533
WHICH IS PRETTY HARD TO TAKE,

26:49.600 --> 26:51.200
GIVEN THAT YGRENE SELECTS WHICH

26:51.266 --> 26:52.600
CONTRACTORS IT ALLOWS INTO ITS

26:52.666 --> 26:54.933
PROGRAM.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.333
IF YOUR SEAFOOD RESTAURANT SELLS

26:56.400 --> 26:58.066
TAINTED LOBSTERS, THEY SHOULDN'T

26:58.133 --> 26:58.766
GET TO SHRUG IT OFF BY SAYING,

26:58.833 --> 27:00.133
"YOU PICKED THE ONE YOU WANTED

27:00.200 --> 27:01.966
OUT OF THE TANK," WHEN THEY PUT

27:02.033 --> 27:03.766
THOSE LOBSTERS IN THERE IN THE

27:03.833 --> 27:05.066
FUCKING FIRST PLACE!

27:05.133 --> 27:06.833
AND COMPANIES ARE ALWAYS GOING

27:06.900 --> 27:08.900
TO INSIST THAT THIS IS JUST A

27:08.966 --> 27:10.766
PROBLEM OF A FEW BAD APPLE

27:10.833 --> 27:11.866
CONTRACTORS, AND THEY'RE ALWAYS

27:11.933 --> 27:13.233
IMPROVING THEIR PROCESSES.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.100
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THE FLAWS OF

27:15.166 --> 27:16.300
THIS PROGRAM ARE BAKED INTO HOW

27:16.366 --> 27:18.300
IT OPERATES.

27:18.366 --> 27:19.866
AND NO ONE KNOWS THIS BETTER

27:19.933 --> 27:22.533
THAN TAX COLLECTORS, BECAUSE

27:22.600 --> 27:23.400
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO END UP

27:23.466 --> 27:24.533
HAVING TO COLLECT ON THE DEBTS

27:24.600 --> 27:29.433
HOMEOWNERS RACK UP, AND ARE

27:29.500 --> 27:30.966
CAN BE THE ONES HAVING TO DO THE

27:31.033 --> 27:31.300
FORECLOSURES.

27:31.366 --> 27:32.566
JUST LISTEN TO THIS MISSOURI TAX

27:32.633 --> 27:33.366
COLLECTOR BEGGING HIS COUNTY TO

27:33.433 --> 27:34.300
GET RID OF ITS PACE PROGRAM JUST

27:34.366 --> 27:34.766
LAST MONTH.

27:34.833 --> 27:35.800
>> I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE FACTS

27:35.866 --> 27:37.766
ARE GOING TO BE: THE MORE OF

27:37.833 --> 27:39.533
THESE THAT YOU HAVE, SOME

27:39.600 --> 27:40.533
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WILL LOSE

27:40.600 --> 27:41.166
THEIR HOUSES.

27:41.233 --> 27:42.633
AND YOU CAN MAKE THE CONSUMER

27:42.700 --> 27:43.700
PROTECTIONS BETTER, AND YOU

27:43.766 --> 27:44.900
CAN MAKE THEM A LITTLE MORE

27:44.966 --> 27:45.933
RIGOROUS, BUT AT THE END OF THE

27:46.000 --> 27:48.066
DAY, SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE THEIR

27:48.133 --> 27:50.400
HOMES TAKEN FROM THEM.

27:50.466 --> 27:56.433
I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

27:56.500 --> 27:57.466
THERE IS NO CIRCUMSTANCE, IN MY

27:57.533 --> 27:59.333
OPINION, IN WHICH IT MAKES SENSE

27:59.400 --> 28:01.400
TO OFFER THE COUNTY'S POWER TO

28:01.466 --> 28:02.866
TAKE YOUR HOUSE IN RETURN FOR

28:02.933 --> 28:04.900
GETTING YOU MONEY TO BUY A NEW

28:04.966 --> 28:06.666
AIR CONDITIONER OR SOLAR PANEL

28:06.733 --> 28:09.233
OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.500
>> John: EXACTLY.

28:10.566 --> 28:11.666
NOBODY IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE

28:11.733 --> 28:12.733
LOSING THEIR HOME BECAUSE OF AN

28:12.800 --> 28:14.033
AIR CONDITIONER!

28:14.100 --> 28:15.700
THEY SHOULD BE LOSING THEIR

28:15.766 --> 28:17.066
HOME BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTED

28:17.133 --> 28:17.900
MEDICAL BILLS -- YOU KNOW,

28:17.966 --> 28:19.900
LIKE AN AMERICAN!

28:19.966 --> 28:22.266
AND ALL OF THIS MAY BE

28:22.333 --> 28:23.333
COMING TO A HEAD IF FORECLOSURES

28:23.400 --> 28:24.533
BEGIN TO RISE IN THE WAKE

28:24.600 --> 28:25.433
OF THE PANDEMIC.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.033
IN FACT, ONE FLORIDA TAX

28:27.100 --> 28:29.000
COLLECTOR HAS EVEN WARNED

28:29.066 --> 28:30.333
THAT PACE WILL BECOME FLORIDA'S

28:30.400 --> 28:30.933
NEXT MORTGAGE CRISIS IF WE'RE

28:31.000 --> 28:32.833
NOT CAREFUL.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.100
WHICH IS CHILLING.

28:34.166 --> 28:36.200
BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS ARE PRIME

28:36.266 --> 28:37.200
FOR A DISASTER, BUT IT SEEMS

28:37.266 --> 28:38.400
LIKE WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING

28:38.466 --> 28:39.200
TO STOP IT.

28:39.266 --> 28:40.933
IT'S LIKE HOW WE INEXPLICABLY

28:41.000 --> 28:42.333
LET HARRISON FORD CONTINUE TO

28:42.400 --> 28:43.833
FLY PLANES.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.233
WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

28:45.300 --> 28:46.933
HAPPEN!

28:47.000 --> 28:47.633
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING BEFORE

28:47.700 --> 28:49.000
IT'S TOO LATE!

28:49.066 --> 28:51.100
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

28:51.166 --> 28:53.166
WELL, WE COULD TRY REFORMS LIKE

28:53.233 --> 28:54.866
STOPPING DOOR-TO-DOOR SALES.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.033
BUT THE TRUTH IS, AS THAT GUY

28:56.100 --> 28:57.733
SAID, PEOPLE COULD STILL END UP

28:57.800 --> 28:59.633
LOSING THEIR HOMES.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.633
THE TOUGHER QUESTION MIGHT BE

29:01.700 --> 29:04.200
WHETHER OR NOT REFORM IS EVEN

29:04.266 --> 29:04.466
WORTH IT.

29:04.533 --> 29:05.533
BECAUSE FOR THE RECORD, PACE

29:05.600 --> 29:07.300
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY LOW-INCOME

29:07.366 --> 29:09.100
HOMEOWNERS CAN GET HELP TO

29:09.166 --> 29:11.466
FINANCE GREEN ENERGY UPGRADES.

29:11.533 --> 29:12.600
NATIONALLY, THERE'S

29:12.666 --> 29:13.666
THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY

29:13.733 --> 29:15.566
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AND

29:15.633 --> 29:17.400
THE FEDERAL WEATHERIZATION

29:17.466 --> 29:18.833
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, OR WAP, AS

29:18.900 --> 29:20.900
IT'S KNOWN TO ABSOLUTELY NO ONE.

29:20.966 --> 29:22.033
AND IN FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA

29:22.100 --> 29:23.466
SPECIFICALLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL

29:23.533 --> 29:25.266
PROGRAMS THAT CAN ASSIST

29:25.333 --> 29:26.666
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

29:26.733 --> 29:28.666
IN ENERGY FUNDING.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.933
THE POINT IS, IF YOU, YOUR

29:31.000 --> 29:32.800
PARENTS, OR ANYONE YOU KNOW IS

29:32.866 --> 29:34.466
CONSIDERING A PACE LOAN,

29:34.533 --> 29:38.600
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY SEE IF

29:38.666 --> 29:41.033
YOU OR THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

29:41.100 --> 29:42.433
PROGRAMS LIKE THESE FIRST.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.566
AND IF YOU LIVE IN A COUNTY

29:43.633 --> 29:44.866
THAT'S THINKING OF IMPLEMENTING

29:44.933 --> 29:46.266
A PACE PROGRAM WITH FOR PROFIT

29:46.333 --> 29:46.900
ADMINISTRATORS, DO WHATEVER YOU

29:46.966 --> 29:48.866
CAN TO STOP IT.

29:48.933 --> 29:50.233
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THIS

29:50.300 --> 29:51.633
BUSINESS MODEL IS FUNDAMENTALLY

29:51.700 --> 29:52.666
FLAWED.

29:52.733 --> 29:54.666
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

29:54.733 --> 29:55.666
AFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY ISN'T

29:55.733 --> 29:56.300
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE INVESTING

29:56.366 --> 29:57.266
IN.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.233
IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.033
BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING

30:01.100 --> 30:02.766
VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN A POSITION

30:02.833 --> 30:03.800

30:03.866 --> 30:04.666

30:08.600 --> 30:09.300

30:11.833 --> 30:13.333
