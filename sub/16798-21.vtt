01:24.078 --> 01:25.546
This is why I'm in therapy, Mom.

01:25.547 --> 01:27.848
I'm literally the assistant
to the secretary of state

01:27.849 --> 01:29.950
and you keep asking when
I'm gonna get a promotion.

01:29.951 --> 01:32.619
I... yes, I know.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.454
Yeah, Mom.

01:34.455 --> 01:36.572
Mom, the work I do is very important.

01:36.573 --> 01:37.773
I put in the usual

01:37.774 --> 01:39.608
and a special brioche
for the secretary to try.

01:39.609 --> 01:40.976
Thanks, Keith.

01:40.977 --> 01:42.444
It sounds like I'm in a
bakery because I am in a...

01:42.445 --> 01:43.645
bakery.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.414
Mom, I got to go. Love you. Bye.

01:45.415 --> 01:47.549
Moms.

01:47.550 --> 01:48.851
Did you get my e-mail?

01:48.852 --> 01:50.018
Sure.

01:50.019 --> 01:51.386
About Colin Mitchell?

01:51.387 --> 01:54.122
It's in the to-be-read folder.

01:54.123 --> 01:56.558
Colin Mitchell, journalist?

01:56.559 --> 01:58.794
Unjustly imprisoned on
bogus espionage charges

01:58.795 --> 02:00.295
in Sudan for six years?

02:00.296 --> 02:02.197
His parents live in my boss's district?

02:02.198 --> 02:04.099
Jordan, saying everything
in the form of a question

02:04.100 --> 02:05.400
won't make me know what
you're talking about.

02:05.401 --> 02:06.468
Fine, whatever.

02:06.469 --> 02:08.604
Obviously, Congressman
Baskin has been into it

02:08.604 --> 02:11.406
with the Sudanese regime over
the years and, spoiler alert,

02:11.407 --> 02:13.008
they're not awesome,

02:13.009 --> 02:15.110
but an intermediary
reached out to us to say

02:15.111 --> 02:17.613
they might be willing to
make a deal to free him.

02:17.614 --> 02:19.147
And you want State to find
out if they're for real?

02:19.148 --> 02:20.349
Hence my e-mail.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.417
I'll look into it and
get back to you. ASAP.

02:22.418 --> 02:24.620
Congressman's way invested in this one.

02:24.621 --> 02:25.654
I'll do my best.

02:25.655 --> 02:27.389
Thank you.

02:27.390 --> 02:30.425
At 6:50 p.m., the secretary
has a pre-call brief

02:30.426 --> 02:34.763
with Undersecretary Albertell
about relations with Japan.

02:34.764 --> 02:38.267
Then at 7:00, she has the
call with Minister Shimabukura.

02:38.268 --> 02:41.403
After that, she leaves
for a personal dinner

02:41.404 --> 02:42.471
with her husband and friends.

02:42.472 --> 02:44.306
His friends. Professor
Lagman and his wife.

02:44.307 --> 02:45.741
M. Sec hates the wife.

02:45.742 --> 02:48.844
So, we'll set the call with
the Mexican ambassador for 8:35.

02:48.845 --> 02:50.879
That should get her out
of most of the main course.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.247
Gracias.

02:52.248 --> 02:53.715
When she gets home,

02:53.716 --> 02:55.317
she'll review the briefing
books for tomorrow.

02:55.318 --> 02:57.986
And that's her day. Anything else?

02:57.987 --> 03:01.356
Actually...

03:01.357 --> 03:02.325
yes.

03:02.326 --> 03:04.761
I ran into Congressman
Baskin's aide this morning.

03:04.762 --> 03:07.130
He said that Sudan reached
out to the congressman

03:07.131 --> 03:11.668
about making a deal for a
journalist named Colin Mitchell.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.904
We've been after them for
years about Colin Mitchell.

03:14.905 --> 03:17.874
Seems odd they would change
their tune all of a sudden.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.042
Baskin's office wanted to know

03:19.043 --> 03:20.843
if we could find out if they're serious.

03:20.844 --> 03:25.348
Well, it's Sudan, so
they're probably not.

03:25.349 --> 03:28.851
I skimmed through some of his stories.

03:28.852 --> 03:30.820
- He's impressive.
- Yeah.

03:30.821 --> 03:34.624
He's a hell of a reporter. Gutsy.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.759
Arguably, too much so.

03:36.760 --> 03:41.331
Okay. Let's run this through the traps.

03:41.332 --> 03:44.100
Get into it with the special
envoy's office, but, Blake,

03:44.101 --> 03:47.770
Peter Harriman can be...

03:47.771 --> 03:49.105
Hostile?

03:49.106 --> 03:51.107
Territorial.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.177
Tread lightly.

03:56.413 --> 03:58.047
Is this coming from the secretary?

03:58.048 --> 03:59.616
Congressman Baskin asked that...

03:59.617 --> 04:00.750
Yeah.

04:00.751 --> 04:01.751
We don't work for him.

04:01.752 --> 04:03.086
Baskin's just spinning up

04:03.087 --> 04:04.687
'cause he's getting
pushback from his district.

04:04.688 --> 04:05.622
I'll ask again.

04:05.623 --> 04:07.123
Is this coming from the secretary?

04:07.124 --> 04:08.491
Not exactly.

04:08.492 --> 04:09.826
Then come back when it is.

04:09.827 --> 04:11.628
Special Envoy Harriman,

04:11.629 --> 04:13.863
the Sudanese government has
been holding Colin Mitchell

04:13.864 --> 04:15.832
- for six years...
- For six years, seven months,

04:15.833 --> 04:17.466
- and five days.
- We're well aware

04:17.468 --> 04:21.504
of Mr. Mitchell's plight,
but, hey, welcome aboard.

04:21.505 --> 04:25.508
In the meantime, we're trying
to hold the regime in Khartoum

04:25.509 --> 04:29.045
accountable for conflicts in Abyei,

04:29.046 --> 04:31.180
South Kordofan and Blue Nile State.

04:31.181 --> 04:32.215
All of which have caused

04:32.216 --> 04:34.484
massive population displacements.

04:34.485 --> 04:36.486
And don't even get me
started about Darfur.

04:36.487 --> 04:37.720
Seriously, don't. It's bad.

04:37.721 --> 04:39.555
Then, of course, there's South Sudan.

04:39.556 --> 04:40.757
Jessica?

04:40.758 --> 04:42.225
All we're trying to do there

04:42.226 --> 04:43.660
is end a civil war and a famine.

04:43.661 --> 04:45.061
Easy-peasy.

04:45.062 --> 04:46.429
The point is, Mr. Mitchell

04:46.430 --> 04:49.632
is, regrettably, one small piece

04:49.633 --> 04:51.801
of a very large, very complicated web.

04:51.802 --> 04:53.169
I understand that,

04:53.170 --> 04:54.971
but do you know if there's
any truth to the rumor

04:54.972 --> 04:56.606
that Sudan is looking
to make a deal for him?

04:56.607 --> 04:57.540
You don't have the clearance

04:57.541 --> 04:59.409
to know what I know.

04:59.410 --> 05:01.711
But thanks for stopping by.

05:01.712 --> 05:03.913
What about him?

05:03.914 --> 05:06.916
Do I have the clearance to
know what you know, Pete?

05:06.917 --> 05:08.251
You seventh-floor types.

05:08.252 --> 05:12.155
Every few years, Bono
reminds you the Sudan exists

05:12.156 --> 05:13.538
and you're in my ear.

05:13.539 --> 05:14.553
Did the Sudanese government

05:14.554 --> 05:17.460
reach out to you about Colin Mitchell?

05:17.461 --> 05:20.029
Fine.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.398
- Yes.
- See?

05:22.399 --> 05:23.433
Wasn't so hard.

05:23.434 --> 05:24.500
And what did they say?

05:24.501 --> 05:25.835
They said he's sick.

05:25.836 --> 05:28.171
Advanced tuberculosis.

05:28.172 --> 05:29.972
And you didn't see fit
to kick this upstairs?

05:29.973 --> 05:31.974
First of all, the Sudanese
government says a lot of things.

05:31.975 --> 05:33.443
- Did they provide any evidence?
- No.

05:33.444 --> 05:34.377
And frankly, they're just trying

05:34.378 --> 05:35.578
to scare us into engaging.

05:35.579 --> 05:37.513
Sudan wants out from under

05:37.514 --> 05:39.082
a host of sanctions.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.879
They're betting that we want
Colin Mitchell back so badly

05:41.880 --> 05:43.519
that we'll take them
off the list of nations

05:43.520 --> 05:44.954
that use child soldiers.

05:44.955 --> 05:46.856
They've actually made
some progress on that,

05:46.857 --> 05:49.125
thanks to said sanctions,

05:49.126 --> 05:50.193
but they're not there yet.

05:50.194 --> 05:51.928
In our judgment, their
claims about Mr. Mitchell

05:51.929 --> 05:52.929
weren't credible.

05:52.930 --> 05:56.132
Let's take this to the secretary.

05:56.133 --> 05:59.368
This is a regime that's
committed genocide.

05:59.369 --> 06:01.537
That's on a list of
state sponsors of terror.

06:01.538 --> 06:03.072
- Whose president...
- Is a war criminal.

06:03.073 --> 06:04.674
I know about Sudan.

06:04.675 --> 06:07.577
Not like I do.

06:07.578 --> 06:09.145
So, trust me when I tell you

06:09.146 --> 06:11.347
it's not worth stepping
on my toes over this one.

06:11.348 --> 06:14.717
See you upstairs.

06:14.718 --> 06:16.953
Okay, bye.

06:16.954 --> 06:19.122
Hey, hey. Thanks, man.

06:19.123 --> 06:20.356
No, thank you.

06:20.357 --> 06:21.691
Harriman's a beast and now he hates me.

06:21.692 --> 06:23.159
Well, you didn't have
to get into it with him.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.393
Of course I did.

06:24.394 --> 06:26.863
A guy steps to you like
that, you can't back down.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.798
Haven't you ever seen Lock Up?

06:28.799 --> 06:32.568
No.

06:32.569 --> 06:35.037
Blake, I need the
secretary's signature on this.

06:35.038 --> 06:37.039
Come see me between 9:35 and
9:40; We'll get it done. Okay?

06:37.040 --> 06:39.041
- But, but...
- Blake, my boss needs five minutes with the secretary.

06:39.042 --> 06:40.576
Too late. Just gave them
away. Try again tomorrow.

06:40.577 --> 06:42.011
Megan, Megan, don't walk away from me.

06:42.012 --> 06:44.092
M. Sec wants that report
from the working group today.

06:44.093 --> 06:45.248
It's like herding cats.

06:45.249 --> 06:46.882
Then hire a cat-herd. Get it done.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.722
Good morning, Blake.

06:52.723 --> 06:53.790
Morning, ma'am.

07:07.626 --> 07:09.610
The purpose of this meeting is to get

07:09.611 --> 07:11.690
all the relevant agencies up to speed

07:11.691 --> 07:13.190
on the latest developments

07:13.191 --> 07:15.319
in regards to the Virginia Field Force.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.996
FBI Director Doherty

07:16.997 --> 07:18.498
and some of his staff are here

07:18.499 --> 07:20.366
to brief us on their investigation.

07:20.367 --> 07:22.835
Thank you, Director Ware.

07:22.836 --> 07:24.871
I'm gonna turn this
over to Dr. Henry McCord.

07:24.872 --> 07:26.272
He's a religious scholar

07:26.273 --> 07:28.741
- who's been assisting us on this case.
- Good morning.

07:28.742 --> 07:31.210
Our working theory is
that the remaining leaders

07:31.211 --> 07:33.112
of the Virginia Field
Force have made contact

07:33.113 --> 07:34.981
with an Al-Qaeda cell
someplace in Syria.

07:34.982 --> 07:37.750
Both groups share
millenarian philosophies

07:37.751 --> 07:39.185
and VFF has had contact

07:39.186 --> 07:41.053
with another jihadist group in the past.

07:41.054 --> 07:43.389
What would be their shared objective?

07:43.390 --> 07:45.124
A biological attack on Jerusalem.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.660
In order to do what?

07:47.661 --> 07:50.363
To start an apocalyptic
war in the Middle East.

07:50.364 --> 07:52.398
Both groups see it as
their purpose on Earth

07:52.399 --> 07:53.766
to do just that.

07:53.767 --> 07:56.636
The NSA obtained signals
intelligence that confirmed

07:56.637 --> 07:59.005
communication between the two groups.

07:59.006 --> 08:00.840
Last known whereabouts of the
three remaining VFF agents,

08:00.841 --> 08:02.842
including a scientist

08:02.843 --> 08:05.411
with experience in
engineering bio-agents,

08:05.412 --> 08:07.680
was on a freighter bound for Greece.

08:07.681 --> 08:10.683
And from there it's just a
short trip to the Syrian coast.

08:10.684 --> 08:12.852
We've put out alerts to all
of our intelligence agencies

08:12.853 --> 08:14.720
and those of our partners in the region,

08:14.721 --> 08:16.589
but Syria is a bit of a black box.

08:16.590 --> 08:17.690
And we know they have designs

08:17.691 --> 08:19.692
on Jerusalem.

08:19.693 --> 08:22.094
So, please, instruct your agencies

08:22.095 --> 08:24.297
to put all available resources into this.

08:24.298 --> 08:26.732
We'll be briefing the
president this afternoon.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.301
We could be looking
at the big one, folks.

08:28.302 --> 08:29.601
Thank you.

08:31.705 --> 08:35.707
I did underscore the seriousness
of the situation, right?

08:35.708 --> 08:39.544
He's concerned we're not
all sufficiently terrified.

08:39.546 --> 08:41.614
Nope. Message received.

08:41.615 --> 08:44.616
I am deeply, deeply scared.

08:46.620 --> 08:49.055
You want to know a real nightmare?

08:49.056 --> 08:50.923
Our dinner tonight.

08:50.924 --> 08:52.959
Come on, the Lagmans aren't that bad.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.927
- Not only is he that bad...
- What...

08:54.928 --> 08:56.095
but the wife...

08:56.096 --> 08:57.563
You're just being overly dramatic now.

08:57.564 --> 08:59.699
Just underscoring the
seriousness of the situation.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.801
- That, well...
- Excuse me.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.502
That was a one time she did that thing.

09:03.503 --> 09:05.571
Bet you don't miss that
part of being married?

09:05.572 --> 09:08.274
Sorry, what?

09:08.275 --> 09:10.243
Yeah, that was insensitive.

09:10.244 --> 09:13.913
Listen, my first
marriage was a nightmare.

09:13.914 --> 09:16.482
The second one, it's going on 22 years.

09:16.483 --> 09:19.819
How'd a jerk like me get so lucky?

09:19.820 --> 09:22.588
I'm really asking.

09:22.589 --> 09:28.127
Love is... you know, mysterious.

09:30.364 --> 09:32.265
I don't know what the
hell we're talking about.

09:32.266 --> 09:34.133
Sorry. Ever since the heart attack,

09:34.134 --> 09:37.003
I'm spilling out all over the place.

09:37.004 --> 09:39.939
I got to go.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.340
So, what do we think?

09:41.341 --> 09:43.709
Are the Sudanese for real
about releasing Colin Mitchell?

09:43.710 --> 09:46.712
They could be. They could not be, ma'am.

09:46.713 --> 09:49.015
And given the conditions

09:49.016 --> 09:51.083
that he's being held in,

09:51.084 --> 09:53.152
it's highly probable that
Mitchell is very sick.

09:53.153 --> 09:55.955
Your concern is that they're playing us

09:55.956 --> 09:59.225
to undermine our negotiations
on other key issues.

09:59.226 --> 10:00.393
That's correct, ma'am.

10:00.394 --> 10:01.827
On the other hand,

10:01.828 --> 10:03.672
if we don't engage...

10:03.673 --> 10:05.231
We've potentially let
a respected journalist,

10:05.232 --> 10:06.666
not to mention an American citizen,

10:06.667 --> 10:10.269
die in a foreign prison for
a crime he didn't commit.

10:10.270 --> 10:11.904
Which is a bad look for us.

10:11.905 --> 10:13.472
Ma'am, if I may?

10:13.473 --> 10:15.508
The Sudanese appear to be very serious,

10:15.509 --> 10:18.144
based on some of the conversations.

10:18.145 --> 10:20.446
Daisy's been having.

10:20.447 --> 10:22.448
Sorry, ma'am.

10:22.449 --> 10:24.483
Many media outlets have reached out

10:24.484 --> 10:26.519
looking for a statement
about Mitchell's health.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.754
My guess is Sudan is leaking to them.

10:28.755 --> 10:30.823
They're trying to squeeze us.

10:30.824 --> 10:32.591
Exactly.

10:32.592 --> 10:35.594
Create public sympathy, make
us look cruel for not engaging.

10:35.595 --> 10:37.463
Yeah, but the point is

10:37.464 --> 10:40.333
why would Sudan put it out there
if they're not looking to deal?

10:40.334 --> 10:42.301
Why shouldn't we engage?

10:42.302 --> 10:46.339
Respectfully... because of this boy.

10:46.340 --> 10:48.641
He was dragooned into a
pro-government militia.

10:48.642 --> 10:52.178
And when he tried to desert,
this is what they did to him.

10:52.179 --> 10:54.413
Since this photo was taken,

10:54.414 --> 10:55.681
three years ago,

10:55.682 --> 10:59.051
the regime's policy of
recruiting child soldiers

10:59.052 --> 11:01.954
has been drastically reduced,

11:01.955 --> 11:04.924
because of the sanctions that
we drove the UN to impose.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.860
But what we're saying is, no relief

11:07.861 --> 11:10.296
until they've been free of
child soldiers for five years.

11:10.297 --> 11:13.199
They still have two years to go.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.633
So before we abandon

11:14.634 --> 11:18.771
a negotiation strategy
that is yielding results,

11:18.772 --> 11:21.707
think about this boy, and
the thousands like him.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.643
Think about what they
could be made to do again

11:24.644 --> 11:26.712
if we pump the brakes too early.

11:26.713 --> 11:28.014
That's all I ask.

11:28.015 --> 11:30.383
I hear you, Pete.

11:30.384 --> 11:34.387
But engagement doesn't
have to mean agreement.

11:34.388 --> 11:37.356
Let's talk to them informally,

11:37.357 --> 11:39.959
maintain the primacy of your negotiation,

11:39.960 --> 11:41.627
see what they're playing at.

11:41.628 --> 11:43.763
There's an open event

11:43.764 --> 11:46.098
at the Sudanese embassy today.

11:46.099 --> 11:49.201
I can make it known that I'll be there,

11:49.202 --> 11:50.369
and see how things shake out.

11:50.370 --> 11:51.903
Okay, then.

11:53.273 --> 11:54.573
What?

11:54.574 --> 11:57.443
Okay, my ex-mother-in-law
is here with Chloe.

11:57.444 --> 11:59.645
The word "emergency"
is being bandied about.

11:59.646 --> 12:02.113
Go, go.

12:03.283 --> 12:04.784
There you are.

12:04.785 --> 12:07.453
Hi. Hey, hi, honey,

12:07.454 --> 12:09.288
Daddy's so happy to see you at work.

12:09.289 --> 12:10.456
Pam, what's up? What's going on?

12:10.457 --> 12:11.590
Well, I tried to call, but...

12:11.591 --> 12:12.792
I was in a meeting, is everything okay?

12:12.793 --> 12:14.326
Well, you know about my hip.

12:14.327 --> 12:15.428
Your what?

12:15.429 --> 12:16.929
My hip. The bursitis?

12:16.930 --> 12:18.864
I've been limping since Christmas.

12:18.865 --> 12:20.132
- Sure. Okay, so...
- Well, the specialist said

12:20.133 --> 12:22.334
he could see me in six
weeks, thank you very much,

12:22.335 --> 12:24.403
but then, this morning,
just as I was hobbling

12:24.404 --> 12:25.838
out of Chloe's music class,

12:25.839 --> 12:29.775
his office calls, and asks if
today at noon is convenient.

12:29.776 --> 12:31.844
I said, well, for your
information, it's not, but I...

12:31.845 --> 12:34.346
And Abby is where, again?

12:34.347 --> 12:36.515
She took the train down
to Delaware for a meeting.

12:36.516 --> 12:37.850
Don't you check your calendar?

12:37.851 --> 12:41.454
- I-I was very busy this morning, Pam.
- Okay.

12:41.455 --> 12:42.688
Delaware's, but...

12:42.689 --> 12:44.371
Can't Chloe just go
to the doctor with you?

12:44.372 --> 12:46.392
Well, you might be
comfortable exposing her

12:46.393 --> 12:48.060
to an antibiotic
resistant Staph infection,

12:48.061 --> 12:49.195
but I'm certainly not.

12:49.196 --> 12:50.296
You know what, I'll take her.

12:50.297 --> 12:52.064
How long do you need, two hours?

12:52.065 --> 12:53.532
Let's make it three.

12:53.533 --> 12:56.969
That so-called music class,
man alive, I need a breather.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.538
I was actually on a
way to a meeting myself.

12:59.539 --> 13:03.075
Why don't we all just ride down together?

13:03.076 --> 13:05.344
Sounds good.

13:07.347 --> 13:09.215
Look.

13:09.216 --> 13:11.683
Wow.

13:16.289 --> 13:17.957
Mr. Whitman.

13:17.958 --> 13:21.427
What an honor to receive
such a renowned visitor.

13:23.396 --> 13:24.897
Tayeb Elkashief.

13:24.898 --> 13:26.732
Thanks for holding the event.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.934
My daughter Chloe loves music.

13:28.935 --> 13:30.202
Indeed.

13:30.203 --> 13:33.906
There is so much more that
unites us than divides, no?

13:33.907 --> 13:35.773
Let's hope so.

13:38.712 --> 13:41.180
Here you go, honey.

13:41.181 --> 13:44.383
Just fry your brain while
Daddy talks to this nice man.

13:44.384 --> 13:45.951
To the matter at hand.

13:45.952 --> 13:48.854
Again, I return to what unites us.

13:48.855 --> 13:53.125
We are as sincere in our desire
to release Mr. Colin Mitchell

13:53.126 --> 13:55.895
as you are in your
desire to bring him home.

13:55.896 --> 13:57.530
That's good to hear.

13:57.531 --> 14:01.834
There's a rumor going
around that he's sick.

14:01.835 --> 14:04.336
Regrettably, that is no rumor.

14:04.337 --> 14:06.505
Do you have proof?

14:06.506 --> 14:08.407
This is from a week ago.

14:08.408 --> 14:11.243
One can only imagine that his condition

14:11.244 --> 14:13.379
has deteriorated since then.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.447
I wanted you to see it first.

14:15.448 --> 14:17.449
What do you mean, "first"?

14:17.450 --> 14:19.552
Before the media does.

14:19.553 --> 14:21.820
What are you trying to do here?

14:21.821 --> 14:23.088
Free my country

14:23.089 --> 14:25.658
from punishing sanctions
we do not deserve.

14:25.659 --> 14:27.159
That's not going to happen.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.360
Then other things will.

14:30.897 --> 14:34.600
If he dies, it'll go badly for you.

14:34.601 --> 14:37.603
But not only for us.

14:37.604 --> 14:39.371
Thank you for your hospitality.

14:39.372 --> 14:41.006
Here, honey. It's time to go.

14:41.007 --> 14:43.179
Daddy needs his phone back.

14:49.348 --> 14:50.701
Just... Daisy! Wait, wait, wait.

14:50.702 --> 14:53.103
Hey, Jay. What's up?

14:53.104 --> 14:54.772
Hi, Chloe.

14:54.773 --> 14:56.173
Did you get any of my calls?

14:56.174 --> 14:57.741
Doesn't matter. The
Sudanese have confirmation

14:57.742 --> 14:59.210
of Mitchell's poor health.
They're leaking it to the press.

14:59.211 --> 15:00.878
Wow.

15:00.879 --> 15:02.947
Well, I'm glad you're telling
me this before the briefing.

15:02.948 --> 15:04.748
It's gonna be a thing no
matter how you play it,

15:04.749 --> 15:06.183
just didn't want you to get caught out.

15:06.184 --> 15:07.351
Yeah, definitely. Thanks.

15:07.352 --> 15:08.719
Look who you've brought to work.

15:28.173 --> 15:29.473
Okay.

15:29.474 --> 15:31.876
I didn't understand that,
but I understood that.

15:31.877 --> 15:33.410
And she is not on our team.

15:33.411 --> 15:34.485
This is America.

15:34.486 --> 15:36.213
There's a healthy
tension between the state

15:36.214 --> 15:39.250
and the, you know, organs of the press.

15:39.251 --> 15:40.818
"Organs"? Ew.

15:40.819 --> 15:43.687
Anyway, I got to...

15:43.688 --> 15:44.922
You okay?

15:44.923 --> 15:47.992
Yeah, totally.

15:47.993 --> 15:49.559
God.

15:57.602 --> 16:01.605
Hey, is what I think is going
on with you going on with you?

16:03.808 --> 16:05.442
I don't want to talk about it.

16:05.443 --> 16:07.778
Really.

16:07.779 --> 16:09.980
Well, if it is,

16:09.981 --> 16:13.017
congratulations.

16:13.018 --> 16:15.252
They devour your life.

16:15.253 --> 16:17.988
I mean, they're the best.

16:17.989 --> 16:20.256
I better go.

16:22.294 --> 16:24.428
So, how long are you
gonna be in Buenos Aires?

16:24.429 --> 16:27.331
Six weeks. That's why I
texted you back so fast.

16:27.332 --> 16:29.066
You know, my grandmother
still lives there.

16:29.067 --> 16:30.134
In Palermo.

16:30.135 --> 16:32.670
You should pop over and say hi.

16:33.872 --> 16:36.307
If I did, you'd
never hear the end of it.

16:36.308 --> 16:38.542
I promise, she'd like
me way more than your ex.

16:38.543 --> 16:39.865
Absolutely.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.579
She warned me against
marrying an American.

16:41.580 --> 16:44.047
Turns out, I should've listened.

16:48.787 --> 16:52.389
And there's the, awkward pause.

16:52.390 --> 16:54.725
Sorry, I'm a little out
of practice with all this.

16:54.726 --> 16:56.360
You're doing fine.

16:56.361 --> 16:58.963
My friends have been after me to
get back out there or whatever,

16:58.964 --> 17:02.098
but I don't even know what I want.

17:03.602 --> 17:06.804
Okay, no, sure, no, no. We
all, we all want that, but...

17:07.973 --> 17:09.605
It's complicated, you know?

17:10.942 --> 17:13.710
No estÃ¡ complicado.

17:26.057 --> 17:27.458
- Is that you or me?
- I think it's me.

17:27.459 --> 17:28.659
Just ignore it, ignore it.

17:28.660 --> 17:30.694
Please, like you would.

17:30.695 --> 17:32.162
It'll just take a second.

17:36.401 --> 17:37.701
Colin Mitchell's family

17:37.702 --> 17:39.970
is going to give a press
conference tomorrow.

17:39.971 --> 17:40.971
To protest the State Department's

17:40.972 --> 17:42.006
handling of the case,

17:42.007 --> 17:43.173
and to plead for their son's life.

17:43.174 --> 17:44.775
Just like Sudan wants them to.

17:44.776 --> 17:46.143
Care to comment?

17:46.144 --> 17:48.312
Really?

17:48.313 --> 17:50.279
Maybe later.

17:53.251 --> 17:54.551
Okay.

17:54.552 --> 17:56.987
I just need to send a quick e-mail.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.722
Quick.

18:01.026 --> 18:03.694
Maybe you were right.

18:03.695 --> 18:05.661
This is a little complicated.

18:07.365 --> 18:09.967
No, you were right.

18:09.968 --> 18:12.769
It's really not.

18:15.907 --> 18:17.707
QuÃ©date ahÃ­.

18:41.342 --> 18:44.443
This is why you don't go
outside the chain of negotiation.

18:45.146 --> 18:47.680
Oy vey.

18:47.681 --> 18:49.055
You let the secretary's errand boys

18:49.056 --> 18:51.724
wander into something they
weren't qualified to deal with.

18:51.725 --> 18:52.925
Good thing I did.

18:52.926 --> 18:54.527
Since you didn't see fit to mention

18:54.528 --> 18:56.596
that Colin Mitchell is dying.

18:56.597 --> 18:59.132
And so now we've played
right into Sudan's hands.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.367
If Colin Mitchell's family
goes out there and says

19:01.368 --> 19:03.403
that they just want to get
their son back before he dies,

19:03.404 --> 19:05.405
but the callous U.S. State Department

19:05.406 --> 19:06.606
won't help them, what then?

19:06.607 --> 19:07.618
That's exactly why

19:07.619 --> 19:08.719
I reached out to the family

19:08.720 --> 19:10.855
and invited them in
for a talk this morning.

19:10.856 --> 19:12.289
What? Without even consulting me?

19:12.290 --> 19:13.357
Yes.

19:13.358 --> 19:15.426
Because I can do that, Pete.

19:17.162 --> 19:19.463
Look, I understand the chain of command.

19:19.464 --> 19:21.464
That's not the point.

19:22.734 --> 19:25.603
They need to feel heard.

19:25.604 --> 19:28.372
That's the point.

19:28.373 --> 19:29.840
Look, not to be callous,

19:29.841 --> 19:31.642
but this threat

19:31.643 --> 19:33.310
of a press conference is a demand

19:33.311 --> 19:34.979
to speak with your supervisor.

19:34.980 --> 19:36.881
I think I have a better chance

19:36.882 --> 19:39.550
of walking them back
from that at this point.

19:39.551 --> 19:41.852
Agreed.

19:41.853 --> 19:43.587
Good.

19:43.588 --> 19:46.590
And of course, I agree with you

19:46.591 --> 19:49.527
that it's important
that we maintain leverage

19:49.528 --> 19:51.662
on the broader issues with Sudan.

19:51.663 --> 19:54.165
Good.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.933
Thank you.

19:55.934 --> 19:58.001
Okay.

19:59.137 --> 20:00.337
Great.

20:00.338 --> 20:01.706
This guy again.

20:01.707 --> 20:03.840
Hi. Nadine, can I
talk to you for a second?

20:09.666 --> 20:12.315
Do you know how hard it
was for me to calm him down,

20:12.316 --> 20:13.784
and today's the one day you decide

20:13.785 --> 20:14.885
to meet me at the elevator?

20:14.886 --> 20:16.653
Sorry, I just needed a quick word.

20:16.654 --> 20:17.688
It's fine.

20:17.689 --> 20:19.289
What's up?

20:19.290 --> 20:21.537
So I had an, unauthorized meeting

20:21.538 --> 20:23.026
with a member of the
foreign press last night.

20:23.027 --> 20:28.065
So, per HR, I thought I should,
you know, disclose contact.

20:28.066 --> 20:31.435
Okay. Um, how long did this meeting last?

20:31.436 --> 20:34.171
From 8:00 p.m. last night until...

20:34.172 --> 20:37.574
two hours ago.

20:37.575 --> 20:39.710
I see.

20:39.711 --> 20:43.345
And, said member was...?

20:44.282 --> 20:47.250
Sofia Martinez.

20:47.251 --> 20:51.388
Well, thank you for alerting me.

20:51.389 --> 20:52.956
I will make a note.

20:52.957 --> 20:54.957
Thanks, Nadine.

20:56.661 --> 20:57.894
Jay?

20:57.895 --> 20:58.995
Yeah?

20:58.996 --> 21:01.363
Good for you.

21:06.104 --> 21:08.105
My son has a weight problem.

21:09.373 --> 21:11.308
What?

21:11.309 --> 21:12.809
My son, he's getting fat.

21:12.810 --> 21:14.044
My ex says it's hormones,

21:14.045 --> 21:15.812
but I think she just lets
him eat whatever he wants.

21:15.813 --> 21:17.547
Mike, what are you doing here?

21:17.548 --> 21:20.050
M. Sec wants a word, off the books.

21:20.051 --> 21:22.144
One of your interns let me
in, which should alarm you.

21:22.145 --> 21:24.087
I have a very busy day.

21:24.088 --> 21:25.989
It was lovely seeing you.

21:25.990 --> 21:28.024
So you, you want me to go?

21:28.025 --> 21:29.092
Please.

21:29.093 --> 21:30.227
Okay, sure.

21:30.228 --> 21:31.995
Absolutely.

21:31.996 --> 21:33.029
The thing is,

21:33.030 --> 21:34.664
I feel like you don't call me back.

21:34.665 --> 21:36.399
That's because I don't call you back.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.201
Yeah, well...

21:38.202 --> 21:40.269
why not?

21:41.739 --> 21:45.308
Mike, um,

21:45.309 --> 21:46.910
what we...

21:46.911 --> 21:50.747
shared on election night was...

21:50.748 --> 21:51.882
Crazy.

21:51.883 --> 21:53.083
Surprising.

21:53.084 --> 21:54.618
But, frankly,

21:54.619 --> 21:55.652
you're not my type.

21:55.653 --> 21:56.787
I get it.

21:56.788 --> 21:59.089
The hatchet man mystique, it's sexy,

21:59.090 --> 22:00.690
but it's intimidating.

22:00.691 --> 22:02.526
That's what I'm talking about.

22:02.527 --> 22:04.795
Fine, I like you, Nadine. I
like you and I would like to

22:04.796 --> 22:06.763
- go out with you.
- You sound like a teenager.

22:06.764 --> 22:08.732
Americans have an underdeveloped
language for romance.

22:08.733 --> 22:09.900
Yes or no?

22:09.901 --> 22:11.201
No.

22:13.971 --> 22:15.572
Yes, Maggie?

22:15.573 --> 22:17.908
The family of Colin
Mitchell is here for you.

22:17.909 --> 22:20.877
Thank you, I'll be right
there. I have to go.

22:24.649 --> 22:26.016
Look,

22:26.017 --> 22:27.417
I'll drop the act.

22:27.418 --> 22:30.554
No more "Mike B" show. Just Mike.

22:30.555 --> 22:32.322
Have dinner with me.

22:32.323 --> 22:33.590
Have dinner

22:33.591 --> 22:36.325
and a salad bar with me and my fat son.

22:39.263 --> 22:41.363
I'll think about it.

22:42.166 --> 22:45.534
You look amazing, by the way.

22:52.577 --> 22:54.711
Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell... Claire,

22:54.712 --> 22:59.482
I can't imagine the pain that
you've been going through.

22:59.483 --> 23:01.585
No, Ms. Tolliver, you can't.

23:01.586 --> 23:02.853
We've been patient.

23:02.854 --> 23:04.955
We've done everything you people

23:04.956 --> 23:06.890
have asked of us. And now, we hear

23:06.891 --> 23:08.825
that our son...

23:08.826 --> 23:11.027
is dying.

23:11.028 --> 23:12.662
- Alone.
- And I will be damned

23:12.663 --> 23:14.731
if I don't do everything
I can to prevent that.

23:14.732 --> 23:15.832
So, we are going public.

23:15.833 --> 23:18.268
I understand.

23:18.269 --> 23:19.970
And if it were my son,

23:19.971 --> 23:22.138
I would do the same thing.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.875
This is our daughter.

23:24.876 --> 23:27.544
Ashley. She's ten now.

23:27.545 --> 23:29.512
She's beautiful.

23:29.513 --> 23:31.514
She's forgetting her father.

23:31.515 --> 23:34.918
Every day, she remembers
him less and less.

23:34.919 --> 23:36.519
And honestly, Ms. Tolliver,

23:36.520 --> 23:40.724
I don't know if that's
good or bad anymore.

23:40.725 --> 23:42.726
Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell,

23:42.727 --> 23:44.427
Claire.

23:44.428 --> 23:45.996
It's an honor to meet you.

23:45.997 --> 23:50.367
And I wish it were under
better circumstances.

23:50.368 --> 23:51.568
I'm Elizabeth.

23:51.569 --> 23:53.003
This is our lawyer, Bill Freundlich.

23:53.004 --> 23:54.137
I...

23:54.138 --> 23:55.839
mostly do real estate law.

23:55.840 --> 23:56.873
Welcome.

23:56.874 --> 23:58.708
Please, let's all sit.

23:58.709 --> 24:01.678
And tell me how you
are and what I can do.

24:01.679 --> 24:03.013
For starters,

24:03.014 --> 24:04.681
it's nice to hear you ask that,

24:04.682 --> 24:06.249
after all these years.

24:06.250 --> 24:07.350
Look, Peter Harriman...

24:07.351 --> 24:08.785
He's the special envoy

24:08.786 --> 24:10.420
- for Sudan.
- They know that, Bill.

24:10.421 --> 24:12.756
Peter's been very professional

24:12.757 --> 24:14.958
all these years. No doubt about that.

24:14.959 --> 24:17.227
To be quite honest,
the Chinese government

24:17.228 --> 24:19.095
has been more sympathetic than our own.

24:19.096 --> 24:21.264
The-the Chinese have reached out to you?

24:21.265 --> 24:22.332
Yes.

24:22.333 --> 24:24.634
We have spoken with them a few times.

24:24.635 --> 24:27.003
W-what, what did they say?

24:27.004 --> 24:30.006
Mostly, they just
asked how we were doing,

24:30.007 --> 24:31.875
and what we'd heard from Colin.

24:31.876 --> 24:33.176
And then, they said

24:33.177 --> 24:35.712
that they have a lot of pull in Sudan,

24:35.713 --> 24:37.213
and that they'd try
their best to help him.

24:37.214 --> 24:41.484
Now, I understand you all
are holding a press conference

24:41.485 --> 24:42.752
later on today.

24:42.753 --> 24:44.321
You can't stop us.

24:44.322 --> 24:46.189
I mean, legally speaking.

24:46.190 --> 24:47.857
They're aware, Bill. God.

24:47.858 --> 24:50.260
All I ask is for 24 hours.

24:50.261 --> 24:53.229
If we can't make significant headway

24:53.230 --> 24:55.432
in securing Colin's release

24:55.433 --> 24:56.967
by this time tomorrow,

24:56.968 --> 24:59.970
then, yeah, go ahead and
take your story public.

24:59.971 --> 25:01.871
Well, we are going to

25:01.872 --> 25:03.672
hold you to that, Madam Secretary.

25:10.748 --> 25:13.616
Thanks for coming when I
sent out the Bat-Signal.

25:13.617 --> 25:15.318
That was brutal.

25:15.319 --> 25:17.153
Coffee?

25:17.154 --> 25:19.289
Thank you.

25:19.290 --> 25:22.292
The China piece is weird, right?

25:22.293 --> 25:25.155
Well, they do buy significant
amounts of Sudan's oil

25:25.156 --> 25:26.696
and other resources.

25:26.697 --> 25:28.264
So, they are a player there.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.432
But they normally don't

25:29.433 --> 25:32.302
say much about human rights abuses

25:32.303 --> 25:35.305
or advocate for freedom of the press.

25:35.306 --> 25:38.875
Well, why would they? They
don't have it themselves.

25:38.876 --> 25:42.111
Exactly. Why would they?

25:42.112 --> 25:44.948
Why reach out to the family

25:44.949 --> 25:49.819
of an American journalist
locked up in Sudan?

25:49.820 --> 25:52.021
You're right, ma'am. It is weird.

25:52.022 --> 25:56.693
They do have more levers
to pull over in Khartoum

25:56.694 --> 25:58.862
than we do. You know what?

25:58.863 --> 26:00.196
Let's get into it with Harriman,

26:00.197 --> 26:02.265
see if there's a play

26:02.266 --> 26:04.667
where China can help us
get Colin Mitchell released.

26:04.668 --> 26:06.469
And we have

26:06.470 --> 26:09.539
23 and a half hours
to make something work.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.407
- Will do.
- Okay.

26:12.543 --> 26:13.843
I didn't get a chance to ask you:

26:13.844 --> 26:16.179
How was the NSC meeting at
the White House yesterday?

26:16.180 --> 26:19.616
The stuff of nightmares.

26:19.617 --> 26:21.751
It's a strange thing,

26:21.752 --> 26:24.687
living your life like normal,

26:24.688 --> 26:27.557
when things are afoot that
could end it at any moment.

26:27.558 --> 26:29.425
Indeed.

26:29.426 --> 26:31.193
But what else can we do?

26:34.431 --> 26:36.065
Nadine?

26:36.066 --> 26:37.200
A word?

26:37.201 --> 26:38.268
Um...

26:38.269 --> 26:40.602
why not?

26:44.275 --> 26:47.610
So many confessions today.

26:47.611 --> 26:48.912
Did you talk to Jay?

26:48.913 --> 26:50.980
Um, about disclosing contact?

26:50.981 --> 26:53.850
What? Did that idiot sleep with Sofia?

26:53.851 --> 26:57.620
Maybe don't quote me on that.

26:57.621 --> 26:59.389
What can I help you with?

26:59.390 --> 27:01.291
I'm gonna need a month off.

27:01.292 --> 27:04.994
Well, that's a long time.

27:04.995 --> 27:07.931
Um... when?

27:07.932 --> 27:10.400
In about six months.

27:12.436 --> 27:13.770
I see.

27:13.771 --> 27:14.904
Yeah.

27:14.905 --> 27:17.373
Congratulations.

27:17.374 --> 27:20.443
Or not.

27:20.444 --> 27:21.945
Do you want to talk about it?

27:21.946 --> 27:26.416
Honestly, I still have a lot
to figure out, almost none of it

27:26.417 --> 27:28.351
super fun. But thanks.

27:28.352 --> 27:31.354
Maybe we can talk later?

27:31.355 --> 27:33.488
Absolutely.

27:35.292 --> 27:37.259
I'm here.

27:38.727 --> 27:40.909
I guess I can see cards
that China could play

27:40.910 --> 27:43.445
to get Mitchell freed, I just
can't see why they'd play them.

27:43.446 --> 27:45.981
Particularly since he wrote
some unflattering stories

27:45.982 --> 27:48.583
around the Beijing Olympics and
was asked to leave the country.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.919
Here's something. Remember when

27:50.920 --> 27:53.488
Sudan was trying to develop
the oil field in Abyei?

27:53.489 --> 27:55.490
Yeah. The sanctions

27:55.491 --> 27:56.591
were keeping them from getting

27:56.592 --> 27:58.627
the drill bit technology they needed.

27:58.628 --> 28:00.128
But, then a year later,

28:00.129 --> 28:01.930
they miraculously
developed it themselves.

28:01.931 --> 28:06.068
And the oil went to China, I presume?

28:06.069 --> 28:07.436
Correct.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.271
We always thought that
China had secretly given them

28:09.272 --> 28:11.006
the technology to get at the oil,

28:11.007 --> 28:13.041
but we could just never
prove it definitively.

28:13.042 --> 28:15.344
What if Colin Mitchell could?

28:15.345 --> 28:18.280
What do you mean?

28:18.281 --> 28:20.672
Look at the timeline.

28:20.673 --> 28:22.851
A dogged investigative
journalist parachutes in

28:22.852 --> 28:26.188
a few months after the
oil field was discovered.

28:26.189 --> 28:27.322
All the other journos

28:27.323 --> 28:30.192
were visiting refugee camps in Darfur.

28:30.193 --> 28:32.828
Colin was in Abyei when he was arrested.

28:32.829 --> 28:34.696
Locked up for espionage,

28:34.697 --> 28:36.031
his laptop destroyed,

28:36.032 --> 28:38.000
and basically held
incommunicado ever since.

28:38.001 --> 28:40.168
Are we saying that

28:40.169 --> 28:43.205
China might be behind his imprisonment?

28:43.206 --> 28:47.309
They could definitely lean
on Khartoum to do that.

28:47.310 --> 28:50.979
China wasn't checking in
on Colin Mitchell's family

28:50.980 --> 28:52.848
out of the kindness of their hearts,

28:52.849 --> 28:54.182
they were digging

28:54.183 --> 28:57.151
to find out if they knew
what he'd been up to.

28:58.287 --> 28:59.454
Looks like the road

28:59.455 --> 29:01.857
to his release really
does go through Beijing.

29:01.858 --> 29:05.092
Just not in the way we thought.

29:10.988 --> 29:12.956
Morning, Matt.

29:12.957 --> 29:14.857
Sit down.

29:19.830 --> 29:21.798
Are you up to speed

29:21.799 --> 29:24.968
with the latest developments
on the Colin Mitchell case?

29:24.969 --> 29:28.004
I heard we suspected China
might be behind the arrest.

29:28.005 --> 29:29.105
Yeah.

29:29.106 --> 29:30.106
"Might be."

29:30.107 --> 29:31.141
The intelligence community

29:31.142 --> 29:32.375
had to do a rush job,

29:32.376 --> 29:33.977
but their best estimate

29:33.978 --> 29:38.148
is that Colin Mitchell was
reporting on the Chinese efforts

29:38.149 --> 29:40.850
to circumvent sanctions, so China leaned

29:40.851 --> 29:43.787
on Sudan to have him
arrested and silenced.

29:43.788 --> 29:46.523
The secretary spoke with both China

29:46.524 --> 29:48.825
and Sudan. They deny it.

29:48.826 --> 29:52.095
So, now that there's no upside
to carrying China's water,

29:52.096 --> 29:54.698
Sudan's trying to squeeze us for
concessions they haven't earned.

29:54.699 --> 29:56.199
And meanwhile,

29:56.200 --> 29:58.568
his family's press conference
is just a few hours away.

29:58.569 --> 29:59.903
So that's where you come in.

29:59.904 --> 30:01.338
The only play we have left

30:01.339 --> 30:04.240
to save Colin Mitchell is to take control

30:04.241 --> 30:05.408
of the narrative.

30:05.409 --> 30:06.609
In short,

30:06.610 --> 30:08.311
we need a speech.

30:08.312 --> 30:10.747
So, with the Mitchell family at my side,

30:10.748 --> 30:12.048
I need to shine a light

30:12.049 --> 30:14.784
on his treatment, and put
pressure on both Beijing

30:14.785 --> 30:17.454
and Khartoum to release him immediately.

30:17.455 --> 30:20.023
But if it doesn't work,
then the administration

30:20.024 --> 30:21.925
looks feckless at home and abroad,

30:21.926 --> 30:23.226
and we own the death

30:23.227 --> 30:24.994
of a hero journalist.

30:24.995 --> 30:26.563
So it has to work.

30:26.564 --> 30:28.765
Can you do that?

30:28.766 --> 30:29.866
Today.

30:29.867 --> 30:32.067
Absolutely.

30:58.696 --> 31:01.263
I am so screwed.

31:05.136 --> 31:07.637
What's wrong?

31:07.638 --> 31:08.571
Writer's block.

31:08.572 --> 31:10.306
Did you try your song?

31:10.307 --> 31:12.475
I tried everything.

31:12.476 --> 31:14.210
Well, you better get unblocked.

31:14.211 --> 31:16.279
The secretary needs that
speech in, like, three hours.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.981
I know. You don't think I know that?

31:17.982 --> 31:19.816
I mean, Colin Mitchell

31:19.817 --> 31:21.251
is a hero.

31:21.252 --> 31:25.388
Traveling the world,
speaking truth to power.

31:25.389 --> 31:27.557
Meanwhile, w-what have
I done with my life?

31:27.558 --> 31:29.492
A man is dying in a Sudanese prison

31:29.493 --> 31:30.994
and you're making this about you?

31:30.995 --> 31:32.295
Yes!

31:32.296 --> 31:33.563
That's my process.

31:33.564 --> 31:35.731
I identify with my subject so
I can write about my subject.

31:35.732 --> 31:38.134
Well, go have your process
someplace else, okay?

31:38.135 --> 31:41.103
I have problems of my own.

31:47.445 --> 31:48.445
Hey.

31:48.446 --> 31:51.246
Are you okay?

31:52.016 --> 31:54.851
I'm pregnant, is what I am.

31:54.852 --> 31:57.220
Whoa.

31:57.221 --> 31:59.755
Wow.

32:01.692 --> 32:04.493
D-Do, who's the dad?

32:09.934 --> 32:11.468
I wish it were me.

32:11.469 --> 32:15.371
Not because I wish we were
still together, but because

32:15.372 --> 32:17.407
then I'd start every day

32:17.408 --> 32:21.277
with a worthy purpose.

32:21.278 --> 32:22.345
You know?

32:22.346 --> 32:23.680
"I got to go out there,

32:23.681 --> 32:26.049
"get things done.

32:26.050 --> 32:27.884
Daisy and I have a baby."

32:27.885 --> 32:30.353
Unbelievable.

32:30.354 --> 32:32.155
Now you're making this about you, too?

32:32.156 --> 32:33.490
- Come on.
- You know what, go.

32:33.491 --> 32:35.024
- What?
- Come on, get out.

32:35.025 --> 32:37.893
Daisy. Da... Can I just say one thing?

32:38.996 --> 32:43.333
Whoever he is, he's a lucky guy.

32:43.334 --> 32:45.702
But even more importantly,

32:45.703 --> 32:49.138
that baby is a lucky guy.

32:49.139 --> 32:51.508
I feel like he's a guy, by the way.

32:51.509 --> 32:55.378
'Cause he is going to have

32:55.379 --> 32:58.914
the best mom in the whole world.

33:00.651 --> 33:03.119
Thanks, Matt.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.688
Now go. Get inspired, okay?

33:05.689 --> 33:06.923
People are counting on you.

33:06.924 --> 33:08.890
Right.

33:12.029 --> 33:14.430
Congressman, this is Matt Mahoney,

33:14.431 --> 33:16.099
Secretary McCord's speechwriter.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.133
Mr. Mahoney, pleasure.

33:17.134 --> 33:18.201
Thank you for taking the time

33:18.202 --> 33:19.602
to see me on such short notice, sir.

33:19.603 --> 33:22.105
Given the circumstances,
it's the least I can do.

33:22.106 --> 33:23.873
Please, take a seat.

33:23.874 --> 33:25.675
So you want to write a speech about,

33:25.676 --> 33:26.843
Colin Mitchell.

33:26.844 --> 33:30.213
Yes, and any information you might have

33:30.214 --> 33:31.381
would be very helpful.

33:31.382 --> 33:33.182
Well, for starters, Colin Mitchell's

33:33.183 --> 33:34.183
a pain in the ass.

33:34.184 --> 33:36.119
Okay.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.387
He started out writing stories

33:37.388 --> 33:39.122
for his hometown newspaper about how

33:39.123 --> 33:41.357
I wasn't doing this or
that for my district.

33:41.358 --> 33:42.959
And I thought, who in the hell

33:42.960 --> 33:46.129
- does this kid think he is?
- I see.

33:46.130 --> 33:48.097
Next thing I know, he's over in Iraq.

33:48.098 --> 33:49.999
He wrote stories about
how our troops are having

33:50.000 --> 33:52.001
to up-armor their own vehicles

33:52.002 --> 33:55.204
to protect against IEDs
because the Pentagon

33:55.205 --> 33:56.239
wasn't doing it.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.441
Young men and women
coming back to my district

33:58.442 --> 34:00.976
missing arms, missing legs.

34:03.314 --> 34:05.548
I started seeing Colin a
little differently after that.

34:05.549 --> 34:07.517
After Sudan happened, I got to know

34:07.518 --> 34:09.018
his parents, his wife.

34:09.018 --> 34:10.687
They told me stories about Colin.

34:10.688 --> 34:12.155
They,

34:12.156 --> 34:15.558
changed my heart about the Fourth Estate.

34:15.559 --> 34:17.025
Is that right?

34:17.027 --> 34:20.129
Colin Mitchell is a pain in
the ass, but he's the kind

34:20.130 --> 34:22.264
of pain in the ass that
makes this country great.

34:24.467 --> 34:25.802
His wife Claire told me something

34:25.803 --> 34:27.971
that Colin liked to say.

34:27.972 --> 34:30.572
I've come to believe it myself.

34:30.574 --> 34:32.208
The stories we want to hear the least

34:32.208 --> 34:35.409
are the ones we need to hear the most.

34:42.319 --> 34:46.422
"Sometimes the stories
we want to hear the least

34:46.422 --> 34:49.192
"are the ones we need

34:49.193 --> 34:51.127
to hear the most."

34:51.128 --> 34:53.896
"That is the credo
investigative journalist.

34:53.897 --> 34:57.533
"Colin Mitchell has chosen to live by.

34:57.534 --> 34:58.935
"From his earliest as a cub reporter

34:58.936 --> 35:01.471
"in his hometown of
Raleigh, North Carolina,

35:01.472 --> 35:03.906
"to the battlefields of Iraq,

35:03.907 --> 35:06.743
to the streets of
Beijing and Khartoum..."

35:06.744 --> 35:10.046
This is good, Matt.

35:10.047 --> 35:13.416
I mean, this is really good.

35:13.417 --> 35:16.119
Thank you, ma'am.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.688
Colin Mitchell has spoken truth to power

35:18.689 --> 35:20.156
at home and abroad.

35:20.157 --> 35:23.059
And in so doing, improved the lives

35:23.060 --> 35:26.295
of his fellow citizens and fellow man.

35:26.296 --> 35:29.732
To the governments of China and Sudan,

35:29.733 --> 35:33.036
I say release him now.

35:33.037 --> 35:36.239
To those of you listening today,

35:36.240 --> 35:38.641
do what Colin would do...

35:38.642 --> 35:43.513
hold those responsible for
his imprisonment to account.

35:43.514 --> 35:47.784
For trying to tell a story
some didn't want told,

35:47.785 --> 35:51.721
Colin Mitchell has paid with his freedom.

35:51.722 --> 35:55.425
We cannot allow him to pay with his life.

35:55.426 --> 35:57.927
Thank you.

36:02.266 --> 36:03.900
Good speech, Matt.

36:03.901 --> 36:06.768
Thank you. Let's hope it works.

36:12.470 --> 36:15.339
And numerous outlets are asking
for a one-on-one with you,

36:15.340 --> 36:17.574
- about your speech.
- Well, that's good.

36:17.575 --> 36:20.310
At least we managed
to make the news cycle.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.246
Yeah, Blake?

36:23.247 --> 36:25.582
I have Minister Chen for you on SVTC.

36:25.583 --> 36:27.750
Put him through.

36:29.220 --> 36:31.922
Why don't you hang out?

36:31.923 --> 36:33.523
Yes. Thanks, ma'am.

36:33.524 --> 36:35.993
Boy.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.794
Mr. Foreign Minister,

36:37.795 --> 36:39.062
to what do I owe the pleasure?

36:39.063 --> 36:41.128
These scurrilous accusations you have

36:41.129 --> 36:42.899
hurled at China in
private, and now in public,

36:42.900 --> 36:45.235
are totally unacceptable
to my government.

36:45.236 --> 36:48.672
Unacceptable or untrue?

36:48.673 --> 36:50.173
If you continue to assert them,

36:50.174 --> 36:51.842
there will be consequences.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.277
- I see.
- However,

36:54.278 --> 36:56.913
as befits our status, it is sometimes

36:56.914 --> 36:59.850
incumbent upon us to take the high road.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.786
Therefore, in our capacity

37:02.787 --> 37:04.588
as economic partners,

37:04.589 --> 37:07.658
we shall advise our
colleagues in Khartoum

37:07.659 --> 37:10.293
to release Colin Mitchell,

37:10.294 --> 37:12.462
as a humanitarian gesture.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.297
Of course, the final
decision is up to them,

37:14.298 --> 37:16.400
but that will be our
last word on the matter.

37:16.401 --> 37:20.270
Is that understood, Madam Secretary?

37:20.271 --> 37:23.507
Perfectly understood,
Mr. Foreign Minister.

37:23.508 --> 37:25.808
Then good day.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.347
Did I miss something,
or did he just yell at me

37:30.348 --> 37:31.996
and then give us everything we wanted?

37:31.997 --> 37:33.750
I don't think you missed anything.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.488
But we are not out of the woods yet.

37:38.489 --> 37:41.158
I still need to get
into it with Khartoum,

37:41.159 --> 37:44.995
and Colin Mitchell is at death's door.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.396
But stand by,

37:46.397 --> 37:48.231
you might need to make a statement soon.

37:48.232 --> 37:50.067
Absolutely.

37:50.068 --> 37:53.303
Good evening. Five minutes ago,

37:53.304 --> 37:56.506
a specially equipped medical
plane left Sudanese airspace

37:56.507 --> 37:59.042
with journalist Colin Mitchell aboard.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.011
Daisy, Daisy...

38:01.012 --> 38:04.214
He is described as being in
serious but stable condition,

38:04.215 --> 38:06.883
and is bound for Ramstein
Air Base in Germany

38:06.884 --> 38:08.719
for further medical evaluation.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.854
Now, once he's been
cleared, he will be free,

38:10.855 --> 38:12.489
after nearly seven years,

38:12.490 --> 38:14.591
to return home to his friends and family

38:14.592 --> 38:16.159
in the United States.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.427
I'll now take questions.

38:17.428 --> 38:18.894
Yeah.

38:24.569 --> 38:25.936
I heard you were up here.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.736
Yeah.

38:29.107 --> 38:33.043
My detail hates it.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.145
Sometimes a person just needs

38:35.146 --> 38:36.747
a breath of fresh air, you know?

38:43.354 --> 38:45.722
It's something that we
got him back, isn't it?

38:45.723 --> 38:47.991
Yeah...

38:47.992 --> 38:49.892
it really is.

38:51.362 --> 38:53.997
Well, you gonna be okay there?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.365
I'm sorry, ma'am.

38:55.366 --> 38:56.433
I don't know what's wrong with me.

38:56.434 --> 38:58.802
I'm all emotional. Guess I'm just...

38:58.803 --> 39:01.438
Pregnant.

39:01.439 --> 39:02.639
Who told you?

39:02.640 --> 39:04.775
Experience.

39:04.776 --> 39:08.445
Well, since I'm having a
breakdown in front of my boss,

39:08.446 --> 39:09.913
can I tell you something?

39:09.914 --> 39:12.849
You can tell me anything.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.018
The father is Joseph Garcia.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.953
Well, was.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.455
Gosh.

39:18.456 --> 39:20.824
Daisy, I'm so sorry.

39:20.825 --> 39:24.494
His parents live in Connecticut, I guess.

39:24.495 --> 39:26.129
But what am I supposed to say?

39:26.130 --> 39:28.899
Your son and I dated for a
week before he got murdered.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.134
I only knew him by his cover name.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.236
Anyways, here's your grandchild.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.105
Because that's not a
crazy intro or anything.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.675
I think his parents might
be comforted by a grandchild.

39:38.676 --> 39:41.044
Yeah, but what about my parents?

39:41.045 --> 39:42.546
I mean, they're church people.

39:42.547 --> 39:46.149
This isn't exactly what
they had envisioned for me.

39:46.150 --> 39:49.686
I mean, I... guess I always thought

39:49.687 --> 39:51.254
that I may have to do it alone,

39:51.255 --> 39:54.357
but not like alone alone.

39:54.358 --> 39:57.861
Yeah.

39:57.862 --> 40:01.398
You know, maybe every
mother feels that way,

40:01.399 --> 40:02.732
no matter who's in their life.

40:02.733 --> 40:03.967
I mean, at the end of the day,

40:03.968 --> 40:06.837
it's just you and the baby and...

40:06.838 --> 40:10.507
it's my job to protect him.

40:10.508 --> 40:11.641
Or her.

40:11.642 --> 40:16.246
Right... but what if
I'm not up to the job?

40:16.247 --> 40:18.582
You are.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.815
You are one of the strongest
women I have ever met.

40:21.816 --> 40:24.704
Even if you don't feel like it right now

40:24.705 --> 40:27.040
'cause you're drowning
in a sea of hormones.

40:27.041 --> 40:28.741
You have no idea, ma'am.

40:28.742 --> 40:30.043
Yes, I do.

40:33.047 --> 40:35.281
You don't have to go at it alone.

40:35.282 --> 40:38.952
Your parents might be shocked,

40:38.953 --> 40:41.654
but you are literally
the light of their lives

40:41.655 --> 40:43.590
and they'll get over it.

40:43.591 --> 40:45.692
And Joe's parents raised a hero,

40:45.693 --> 40:49.095
so, really, how bad can they be?

40:49.096 --> 40:52.198
Then you got all of us here.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.833
God help you.

40:53.834 --> 40:56.936
Thanks.

40:56.937 --> 41:00.872
It's a beautiful world, Daisy.

41:04.345 --> 41:07.947
And the best ride is just about to start.

42:26.493 --> 42:28.261
Welcome home, Colin.

42:28.262 --> 42:30.096
Thank you.
