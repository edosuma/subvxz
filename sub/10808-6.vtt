WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:06.070
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.866
Go slowly.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.869
The great ones always set
traps for grave robbers.

01:08.869 --> 01:12.072
The most innocent stone
can trigger the catastrophe.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.674
I can't take all night, Ahmed.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.776
I don't want
the Egyptian army dropping in

01:15.776 --> 01:17.044
for a piece of this pie.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.379
I assure you, Dr. Gromley...

01:18.379 --> 01:19.647
Gormley.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.116
I have told no one
of my discovery, except you,

01:22.116 --> 01:23.384
and the lady, of course.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.652
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chop, chop.

01:24.652 --> 01:25.846
Come on.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.431
AHMED: The minute
I discovered these passages,

01:37.431 --> 01:40.668
I could hear the song
of gold and jewels.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.202
Spare us the poetry, Ahmed.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.571
I could have gone
to the authorities, of course.

01:44.571 --> 01:47.508
But why keep such wonderments
locked in a museum

01:47.508 --> 01:50.177
when they can be converted
into cash?

01:50.177 --> 01:51.578
You're a real philosopher.

01:51.578 --> 01:52.846
And you, Dr. Gromley...

01:52.846 --> 01:54.848
Gormley.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.217
...are a practical
archaeologist.

01:57.217 --> 02:00.187
Are you sure you can get the
treasures out of the country?

02:00.187 --> 02:01.689
Don't worry about Harold.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.123
He has his ways.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.057
Damn right.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.662
HAROLD:
How much further?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.698
AHMED:
I'm not exactly certain

02:10.698 --> 02:12.199
what lies beyond this door.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.600
HAROLD:
Look at that!

02:13.600 --> 02:16.570
AHMED: This is as far
as I've explored.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.073
These stones presented
an insurmountable obstacle.

02:19.073 --> 02:20.340
(wind whistling)

02:20.340 --> 02:21.542
HAROLD:
Incredible.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.810
What does it say?

02:22.810 --> 02:26.046
Well, basically,
what it comes down to is,

02:26.046 --> 02:27.381
"No admittance.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.850
No one is allowed
beyond this point."

02:29.850 --> 02:31.318
I'll get the plastic explosives.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.519
This shouldn't take much.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.821
Be careful.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.024
AHMED: Yes. Proceed
with the utmost extreme caution.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.325
It would not take much

02:38.325 --> 02:40.928
to bring a ton of rocks
down on our heads.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.063
The risk is worth the reward,
wouldn't you say?

02:43.063 --> 02:44.331
Shouldn't we take cover?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.833
I'm gonna do this
with a series

02:45.833 --> 02:48.102
of small explosions; use just
as much power as we need.

02:48.102 --> 02:49.336
We'll wear the thing down.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.039
Yes. No need to destroy
any valuable artifacts.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.273
HAROLD:
Don't worry.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.309
If this really is the tomb
of Amenhotep,

02:55.309 --> 02:57.077
you'll be able
to buy yourself a pyramid.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.012
Ready?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.138
Stand back.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.953
Here, honey.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.319
Hold this.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.962
(scraping)

03:20.033 --> 03:21.869
AHMED:
Utterly amazing.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.403
How did you do that?

03:23.403 --> 03:24.705
I don't know.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.640
Maybe I touched
a release mechanism.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.076
Oh, I'm not gonna stand here
second-guessing a door.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.277
Let's go.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.472
Ahmed, you first.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.679
Thank you, but I would gladly
surrender that honor.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.752
WOMAN:
Oh, wow.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.860
(whispering):
Harold?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.240
Nothing shines.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.809
No gold?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.544
(whispering): Well, this isn't
the pharaoh's tomb.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.912
It's just an outer chamber.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.472
Well, who's that,
the receptionist?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.218
WOMAN:
"Here lies

04:11.218 --> 04:13.821
"Tapok, Lord Chamberlain

04:13.821 --> 04:17.391
to the Most High and Mighty,
Son of the Sun, Ahknaton."

04:17.391 --> 04:19.459
(squealing):
We found it! Told ya!

04:19.459 --> 04:20.661
(sighs)

04:20.661 --> 04:24.264
Okay, the pharaoh's tomb must be
somewhere beyond that point.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.632
All right, first things first.

04:25.632 --> 04:26.967
-Ahmed?
-Huh?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.235
Help me lift this lid.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.070
Oh, why disturb an employee?

04:30.070 --> 04:31.332
BOTH:
Come on!

04:35.609 --> 04:37.077
-(woman murmurs)
-(Ahmed exhales)

04:37.077 --> 04:38.245
HAROLD:
Ready?

04:38.245 --> 04:39.513
AHMED:
Yes.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.504
(all grunting with effort)

04:48.889 --> 04:51.458
WOMAN:
Look at that necklace.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.227
Riches to rags.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.494
Pardon the pun.

04:54.494 --> 04:55.796
If this is the servant,

04:55.796 --> 04:58.265
can you imagine
what's waiting for us, huh?

04:58.265 --> 05:00.200
AHMED: That bauble alone is
worth a king's ransom.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.736
I would take it and gladly
leave well enough alone.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.238
Chicken feed, Ahmed.

05:04.238 --> 05:05.806
We're going
for the whole bonanza.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.109
The pharaoh's chamber must be
somewhere beyond this point.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.236
A bird in the hand.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.048
HAROLD:
Leave it!

05:15.048 --> 05:17.243
We'll pick it up
on the way back.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.657
(gags, neck cracks)

05:23.657 --> 05:26.159
(screaming)

05:26.159 --> 05:27.558
(thud)

05:32.332 --> 05:34.034
(Harold and woman gasp)

05:34.034 --> 05:36.970
This has got to be an illusion.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.904
Oh, yeah? Tell Ahmed.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.510
(grunting)

05:43.510 --> 05:45.444
(angry muttering)

05:47.080 --> 05:48.315
The plastique.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.714
WOMAN: Hell, no.
You can't set that off in here.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.187
Press it.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.590
(explosion)

05:56.590 --> 05:58.425
(Tapok grunts)

05:58.425 --> 06:00.416
(mutters angrily)

06:01.762 --> 06:04.331
(Harold yelping)

06:04.331 --> 06:05.798
Please, dear God! No!

06:07.567 --> 06:09.728
(nasal grunting)

06:11.071 --> 06:15.142
I will strip the flesh
from your bones!

06:15.142 --> 06:16.777
Aileen, save me!

06:16.777 --> 06:18.245
He spoke English.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.714
I speak the language
of any intruder

06:20.714 --> 06:23.083
in this sacred burial place,

06:23.083 --> 06:27.087
so they can hear my curse
over their bloody coffins.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.789
(Harold shrieking)

06:28.789 --> 06:30.457
HAROLD:
Humor him!

06:30.457 --> 06:31.491
-AlLEEN: Um, hi.
-(Tapok growls)

06:31.491 --> 06:33.794
(clears throat) Uh, you say
others have come here?

06:33.794 --> 06:34.818
Many others!

06:35.729 --> 06:37.798
And it has amused me

06:37.798 --> 06:40.801
to watch their bones
disintegrate.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.970
We're not grave robbers.
We're... We're scientists.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.005
Like your astrologers.
We... We only want

06:45.005 --> 06:46.573
to study your culture.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.042
No matter!

06:49.042 --> 06:52.112
You're ghosts now!

06:52.112 --> 06:54.247
(Harold whimpering)

06:54.247 --> 06:56.350
I will play with you

06:56.350 --> 06:59.386
as if you were my toys.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.688
I will amuse myself,

07:01.688 --> 07:03.824
and then, oblivion!

07:03.824 --> 07:05.258
HAROLD (crying):
He means it.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.027
AILEEN:
I know he means it!

07:07.027 --> 07:10.163
I will think... of a slow death.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.164
(Harold whimpers)

07:11.164 --> 07:13.066
A special one,
something memorable

07:13.066 --> 07:16.403
for me to recall
into the next millennium.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.572
As you wish, Lord Chamberlain

07:18.572 --> 07:20.874
to the Most High and Mighty,
Son of the Sun.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.409
-What are you saying?
-Shut up.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.977
You know my title?!

07:23.977 --> 07:25.479
What-What, are you kidding me?

07:25.479 --> 07:26.813
You're a very important man.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.315
Uh, well, yes,

07:28.315 --> 07:30.550
but I thought that,
after all these year--

07:30.550 --> 07:31.710
Wait a minute!

07:32.919 --> 07:35.288
You read it
on my sarcophagus!

07:35.288 --> 07:36.656
Oh...

07:36.656 --> 07:38.592
We're dead!

07:38.592 --> 07:41.361
I will make marbles
of your eyeballs!

07:41.361 --> 07:42.963
AILEEN:
All right.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.498
Do it. Fine. Do it.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.699
Get it over with.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.100
-Ai|een!
-Shut up!

07:47.100 --> 07:48.535
Yes.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.770
Right now.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.937
HAROLD:
No!

07:50.937 --> 07:53.507
No! No! No, not right now!

07:53.507 --> 07:56.410
(Tapok laughs)

07:56.410 --> 07:57.611
She was just trying
to incite you.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.879
You're not gonna let yourself
get talked

07:58.879 --> 08:00.047
into anything, are you?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.348
I wonder how long

08:01.348 --> 08:03.784
your heart will keep beating
outside of your chest.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.719
Not long,
Your High and Mightiness.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.687
He's not gonna kill you... yet.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.790
-You want to bet on it?!
-|-| know it.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.860
Do you dare
to doubt Tapok's declaration?

08:13.860 --> 08:15.595
Oh, no, l'm-l'm... I'm not
doubting anything,

08:15.595 --> 08:17.064
Your Mumminess.

08:17.064 --> 08:20.000
l'm-l'm just saying
that you have had many chances

08:20.000 --> 08:22.636
to kill us, and you actually
have-have not done that.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.738
That'd come as a surprise
to Ahmed.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.074
Uh, no,
he's too bored to kill us.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.408
That's it, isn't it?

08:28.408 --> 08:29.676
Come on.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.645
3,000 years of loneliness?

08:31.645 --> 08:34.714
You want to keep us around
to amuse you for a little while.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.084
The only thing
that would amuse me would be

08:37.084 --> 08:40.120
to watch you die, inch by inch.

08:40.120 --> 08:44.157
I think I'll use my
Golden Chain of Office

08:44.157 --> 08:46.426
to choke the air
out of you, wench.

08:46.426 --> 08:50.130
A golden death
for a golden life.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.431
Um, well, okay, kill me.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.133
See if! care. Fine. Fine.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.102
But you'll be snuffing out
your last chance

08:55.102 --> 08:57.504
of grabbing a few laughs
for a century, at least.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.473
Watching you squirm,

08:59.473 --> 09:01.675
I'll be laughing for centuries.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.877
Well, sure.
I mean, who wouldn't?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.046
But, you know,
you got to think the long-term.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.814
After 500 years or so,

09:07.814 --> 09:10.250
those laughs are gonna
be wearing a little bit thin.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.453
I mean, sitting around,
back to the old boredom,

09:13.453 --> 09:15.288
day in and day out.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.524
Sitting around
in that old sarcophagus.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.759
You know what you need?

09:19.759 --> 09:22.629
You need something that's gonna
really keep you laughing.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.131
Something really fun.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.967
Like-Like games, sports.

09:26.967 --> 09:30.170
-What sports?
-What sports?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.172
Uh... arm wrestling.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.373
(clears throat)

09:33.373 --> 09:34.608
Harold, there,

09:34.608 --> 09:36.343
is a terrific arm wrestler.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.844
l-l bet he could beat you.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.780
No, no, no, no,
I've got weak arms, weak.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.449
What do you bet?

09:42.449 --> 09:43.717
Well, what do I bet?

09:43.717 --> 09:45.919
Um... my Walkman.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.581
You r-You r-You r what?

09:49.689 --> 09:52.025
Okay, boys...

09:52.025 --> 09:54.961
let's see you do it.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.029
(Tapok grunts, Harold sobs)

09:56.029 --> 09:57.464
-Give me the toy!
-HAROLD: No!

09:57.464 --> 09:58.732
Congratulations.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.534
You win the Walkman,
fair and square.

10:00.534 --> 10:01.701
(Harold sobs in pain)

10:01.701 --> 10:04.104
You-You...
You are in terrific shape.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.940
But I bet you couldn't take
Harold in a fight.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.309
-T-T-Take?
-What?!

10:09.309 --> 10:11.678
Anybody can beat Harold
in an arm wrestle.

10:11.678 --> 10:12.979
Are you kidding me?

10:12.979 --> 10:14.648
Look at the guy.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.117
But no one can beat Harold
in a fight.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.785
Fights like a demon.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.421
I thought we were supposed
to be on the same side.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.956
Look, Raggedy Andy,
I'm an intellectual.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.124
Oh!

10:24.124 --> 10:26.293
-TAPOK: Next!
-A|LEEN: Uh... Uh...

10:26.293 --> 10:27.954
How about riddles?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.866
Uh, what has the face
of a woman, the body of a lion,

10:32.866 --> 10:35.468
and even when it's working,
it always takes pause?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.704
Easy. The sphinx.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.339
Oh, even I knew that one.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.341
That's older than I am.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.475
AILEEN:
Okay, okay.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.643
I've got an idea.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.612
What do you say
we play some cards?

10:45.612 --> 10:47.414
Um, uh, the tarot?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.915
Uh, not exactly.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.317
I was thinking of something

10:50.317 --> 10:53.119
a little more
on the lines of poker.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.688
"Pawkuh"? Show me how.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.956
Okay.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.691
You sit here.
(Aileen pats seat twice)

10:57.691 --> 10:59.392
Harold, sit over there.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.689
(Harold moans)

11:06.600 --> 11:08.235
Uh, wh-what about you?

11:08.235 --> 11:10.570
I'll just be
your good luck charm.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.805
Wait.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.373
TAPOK:
Uh, what now, woman?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.342
(clears throat)
We've got to play for something.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.077
Oh, yes, the stakes.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.145
You win, we die
with plenty of screaming.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.380
(Harold scoffs)

11:20.380 --> 11:22.282
He wins, you let us go.

11:22.282 --> 11:26.519
As keeper of the tomb,
I must destroy all intruders.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.721
HAROLD:
Hey, lighten up.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.888
It's just a game.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.023
Aren't there any exceptions?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.359
What should we play for?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.027
Wait! I have it!

11:34.027 --> 11:36.997
As a youth, we frequently
played with face cards,

11:36.997 --> 11:39.532
and we had nothing to wager
but our garments.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.900
Garments?

11:40.900 --> 11:43.036
Oh, it was most diverting.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.938
Every hand...

11:44.938 --> 11:47.807
(laughing):
a garment was won or lost.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.110
This is starting to sound
an awful lot like strip poker.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.278
Uh-huh.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.014
And why not,
you spawn of a jackal?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.249
I'm not gonna play strip poker
with a mummy.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.218
-If he loses, he'll turn...
-Shut up!

11:58.218 --> 12:00.553
(whispers): But if he loses,
he'll turn to dust!

12:00.553 --> 12:01.921
Exactly, Harold.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.218
Well, who deals?!

12:06.826 --> 12:08.851
Deuces wild?

12:19.539 --> 12:21.041
HAROLD:
How many cards?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.842
TAPOK:
Eh, uh, what would you suggest?

12:22.842 --> 12:25.078
AILEEN:
Get rid of those three kings.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.380
But I thought
kings are most powerful.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.449
Could three kings ever rule
a country?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.084
Would they ever agree
on anything?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.652
Ah... I see what you mean.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.621
I'll take... three.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.324
Coming up.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.727
I better win this game,
or I risk being in violation

12:40.727 --> 12:43.063
of Amenhotep's decency code.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.398
HAROLD:
I'm in for a shirt.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.001
Raise him a bandage.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.636
Are you certain?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.604
Play or pay.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.239
I raise you a bandage!

12:53.239 --> 12:54.407
I'll see you.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.442
Show him your cards.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.743
Oh, well, yes,
I remember. I remember.

12:56.743 --> 13:01.481
Uh, I have a three, a four,
a five, a nine,

13:01.481 --> 13:04.150
and a jack deprived of an eye.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.251
Pair of tens.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.853
You lose.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.188
What? Again?!

13:08.188 --> 13:10.486
Unravel.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.906
Oh, this is most involving.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.808
(laughing):
I haven't had so much fun

13:28.808 --> 13:32.112
since Amenhotep
changed his name to Ahknaton,

13:32.112 --> 13:34.948
and made everybody pray
to the sunrise.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.182
(Aileen laughs)

13:36.182 --> 13:37.784
HAROLD:
Sounds like a real kick.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.452
Uh, I bet a bandage.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.187
Mm... pair of pants.

13:41.187 --> 13:44.791
Uh, why don't you get
four more cards?

13:44.791 --> 13:47.193
Oh, but-but I thought

13:47.193 --> 13:50.930
a-a-a series in the same design
is conducive to good fortune.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.933
Uh, yeah, ordinarily it is,
but not in spades.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.201
Oh.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.759
Four.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.408
Your bet.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.809
Oh, I feel most fortunate.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.444
I bet two bandages!

14:04.444 --> 14:05.912
HAROLD:
I'll see you,

14:05.912 --> 14:07.147
and I'll raise you a jacket.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.377
Agreed! Show your cards!

14:10.417 --> 14:12.385
Four queens.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.489
Four ones.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.224
Harold wins.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.561
But-But-But-But I thought
ones are powerful.

14:21.561 --> 14:25.165
Uh, yeah, that's true, they are,
but-but only on the Sabbath.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.156
Tough break.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.938
Your hand reminds me
four times over

14:31.938 --> 14:34.741
of a certain young lady
of my acquaintance.

14:34.741 --> 14:39.078
A girl from Dashur
who took quite a fancy to me.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.713
Unfortunately,

14:40.713 --> 14:43.783
she was committed
to my master Ahknaton.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.752
Nevertheless,

14:45.752 --> 14:47.720
we managed a moment
or two together,

14:47.720 --> 14:49.489
when I held her in my ar...

14:49.489 --> 14:50.490
HAROLD:
Less talk

14:50.490 --> 14:51.925
and more action, pal?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.493
(roaring)

14:53.493 --> 14:55.462
(yelling)

14:55.462 --> 14:59.466
You dare to interrupt
my only pleasant memory?!

14:59.466 --> 15:00.300
Oh, no...

15:00.300 --> 15:02.302
I should pluck out your arms

15:02.302 --> 15:04.037
like flower petals!

15:04.037 --> 15:06.840
AILEEN:
Tell us about that girl.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.641
Uh, the one from Dashur.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.144
I-I-I'd really like
to hear about her.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.414
Oh, it was most romantic.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.550
We met secretly,

15:17.550 --> 15:20.386
in a small boat,

15:20.386 --> 15:23.356
set among the papyrus reeds.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.221
I knew you were a romantic.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.133
(whispers):
What now?

15:34.133 --> 15:35.635
I think he's in a trance.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.937
Well, I thought you said
once the bandages were off,

15:37.937 --> 15:38.938
he'd be vaporized.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.939
Yeah, I did.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.042
He's looking better
than ever, isn't he?

15:43.042 --> 15:45.211
We should, uh,
make our move now, huh?

15:45.211 --> 15:46.946
How? The door's solid.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.916
Well, doors have locks,
locks have keys.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.484
Aha!

15:51.484 --> 15:52.752
I've got it!

15:52.752 --> 15:53.586
You've got what?

15:53.586 --> 15:55.355
Well, I just took a little trip.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.891
An out-of-body voyage
to a place--

15:57.891 --> 16:00.693
a most unusual
and interesting place--

16:00.693 --> 16:03.763
known, I believe, as Las Vegas.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.865
-(Harold gulps loudly)
-I saw a thousand games there

16:05.865 --> 16:09.969
played by a man named, uh,
uh, Lowball Jones.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.437
Oh, he... I...

16:11.437 --> 16:13.439
It was very educational
in poker.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.875
I saw it all-- Stud, Draw,

16:15.875 --> 16:18.211
Cincinnati, Pass the Trash,

16:18.211 --> 16:21.381
and my own personal favorite,

16:21.381 --> 16:23.216
Spit in the Ocean.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.385
I think that he's ready to play.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.953
TAPOK:
Deal.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.522
And don't think I didn't hear
you two plotting against me.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.514
You want the door open?
Here is the power.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.365
This will serve
as your final prize, provided

16:39.365 --> 16:41.034
you can win another hand.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.669
Sounds good to me.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.534
Let's play.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.277
HAROLD:
How many?

16:51.277 --> 16:52.642
I'll stick.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.207
(sighs quietly)

16:59.686 --> 17:01.210
What do you got?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.958
Pair of treys, ace high.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.392
You won.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.597
He won!

17:10.597 --> 17:12.432
Oh, about time, too.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.133
Well, I'll, uh...

17:14.133 --> 17:17.236
All right, I'll give you back,
uh, three feet of bandages.

17:17.236 --> 17:20.006
No. I want your helmet.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.634
Whatever you say.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.546
Pretty good fit, too.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.377
Deal!

17:41.794 --> 17:43.262
I'm freezing.

17:43.262 --> 17:47.200
Look, I'll swap you
50 feet of rags for my jacket.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.335
Use the bandages.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.929
They're not so bad,
once you get used to them.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.009
(Harold scoffs)

17:56.009 --> 17:58.000
Uh, help me.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.756
Aha!

18:09.756 --> 18:12.191
I got you dead to rights
this time.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.128
I see you,
and I raise you my tie.

18:15.128 --> 18:18.765
Your-Your face is a beacon
of newfound confidence.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.667
You bet your ribbons it is!

18:20.667 --> 18:23.603
Oh, I tire of this.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.204
I have a proposition for you.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.506
All or nothing.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.235
Your tie against the key.

18:29.242 --> 18:32.011
You're on.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.980
(stammers)
One small catch, Harold.

18:33.980 --> 18:37.083
If you lose,
you take my place down here.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.886
He's beginning to look like he
belongs down here, anyhow.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.054
Oh.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.455
HAROLD:
No problem.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.623
If I lose.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.319
Harold,
he's playing for the key.

18:47.560 --> 18:51.121
Well, it's really an amulet,
but it does open the door.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.667
What do you got, pops?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.836
You first.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.006
Nine, ten, jack, queen,
king of diamonds.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.240
Straight flush.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.942
Beat that, Desert Breath.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.740
Oh... ten...

19:06.846 --> 19:08.746
Jack...

19:10.049 --> 19:11.141
Queen...

19:14.187 --> 19:15.245
King...

19:17.290 --> 19:19.292
Ace of hearts.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.126
(gasps)

19:20.126 --> 19:22.195
Straight royal flush.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.297
In hearts.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.398
Your tie, sir.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.100
Listen, here...

19:27.100 --> 19:29.001
I'm a very important
archaeologist.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.870
The whole world
will be looking for me.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.139
Oh, they will
undoubtedly find you...

19:33.139 --> 19:35.334
after 50 centuries or so.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.095
(muffled shrieking)

19:56.095 --> 19:58.798
I doubt he'll make
a very good guard for Ahknaton.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.601
(Harold whimpering)

20:01.601 --> 20:03.436
But the power
of the cursed mummy

20:03.436 --> 20:05.471
comes entirely
from the bandages.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.406
(muffled muttering)

20:07.406 --> 20:08.775
(Aileen gasps and yells)

20:08.775 --> 20:10.576
See?

20:10.576 --> 20:14.013
(muffled muttering
and whimpering)

20:14.013 --> 20:17.683
Yes, even the power of
a mummy has its limitations.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.585
-The amulet?
-HAROLD: No!

20:19.585 --> 20:20.820
It could stop 20 mummies.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.155
-(Harold shrieks angrily)
-Oh...

20:22.155 --> 20:24.690
It could also open
a certain door.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.727
Aw, Tapok, what about me?

20:27.727 --> 20:30.129
Are you gonna leave me
down here to rot?

20:30.129 --> 20:32.198
TAPOK (clearing throat):
Well, Aileen,

20:32.198 --> 20:37.436
you do look a lot like that girl
in the papyrus reeds,

20:37.436 --> 20:41.607
and I might consider
a joyful alliance.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.709
-I love older men.
-(Tapok gasps passionately)

20:43.709 --> 20:45.044
(muffled):
Older men?!

20:45.044 --> 20:47.980
(Harold mutters, then shrieks)

20:47.980 --> 20:50.716
And remember
what they say in Vegas:

20:50.716 --> 20:53.319
Keep your eye
on the bottom of the deck.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.889
(laughing)

20:56.889 --> 21:00.326
He was palming the cards!

21:00.326 --> 21:02.228
(Tapok laughing,
Harold whimpering)

The dark side is always there.
