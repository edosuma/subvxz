00:21.998 --> 00:25.287
What's wrong? You seem nervous.

00:25.322 --> 00:28.136
Well, you never take the
bag off until we get inside,

00:28.221 --> 00:30.885
and you took us a
different route this time.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.136
I figure we can dispense
with the formalities.

00:34.171 --> 00:36.503
You're not going back to the FBI, and...

00:36.538 --> 00:39.987
12 hours from now, this'll all be over.

00:51.976 --> 00:53.609
Shipment's ready.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.359
Don't leave this room. I'll be right back.

01:14.744 --> 01:16.510
Shepherd wants to see you.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.993
Morning. Made you breakfast.

01:28.063 --> 01:31.686
Good morning. What... what is the occasion?

01:31.721 --> 01:34.933
Well, if my math is correct, I believe that

01:34.968 --> 01:37.740
this is our "tenth time
sleeping over" anniversary,

01:37.775 --> 01:39.219
which, as everyone knows,

01:39.254 --> 01:41.967
is the Agay-Bonjan Breakfast anniversary.

01:42.002 --> 01:46.590
Oh, yes, the traditional Agay...

01:46.625 --> 01:47.494
- Bonjon.
- Bonjon.

01:47.529 --> 01:50.180
- It's sort of my specialty.
- Mmm.

01:50.215 --> 01:51.733
Just a little something I picked up

01:51.767 --> 01:54.403
during my time with
Doctors Without Borders.

01:54.438 --> 01:55.438
Humblebrag.

01:57.658 --> 02:00.857
Why are you doing this?

02:00.919 --> 02:06.573
I just... haven't felt this
happy in a very long time,

02:06.651 --> 02:07.821
and to be honest, I never imagined

02:07.856 --> 02:10.726
anything like this ever
happening to me again.

02:10.761 --> 02:13.203
Me, neither.

02:13.321 --> 02:16.604
And now that it has, I kind of want to

02:16.639 --> 02:21.763
feed you fried eggs and tomatoes
and onions and mint forever.

02:21.846 --> 02:25.000
You know what? If it makes you happy,

02:25.111 --> 02:27.669
I can probably make myself available.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.276
Good.

02:37.396 --> 02:41.092
Well... You ready for this?

02:41.147 --> 02:44.509
How would I know if I'm ready when
I still don't know what we're doing?

02:48.973 --> 02:50.907
There's a problem in the armory.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.075
Hold that thought. We'll
be back in five minutes.

03:32.670 --> 03:33.936
Come on.

03:40.862 --> 03:42.878
- See you later.
- Yep.

03:45.449 --> 03:46.936
Has Jane come in yet?

03:47.016 --> 03:48.223
No.

03:48.258 --> 03:50.291
Come get me when she does.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.125
Okay, this whole Weller/Nas thing...

03:57.127 --> 03:59.139
I have no idea what you're talking about.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.546
Speaking of no idea,

04:02.581 --> 04:03.825
one of my buddies at the Nine-Six

04:03.884 --> 04:07.562
mentioned something about the chief
suspect in the Jones murder disappearing.

04:07.608 --> 04:09.942
Do you know anything about that?

04:14.197 --> 04:16.353
Freddy was a troubled guy.

04:16.401 --> 04:18.176
Battles with addiction and unemployment.

04:18.211 --> 04:21.350
In my experience, it's not unusual
for people like that to just fade away.

04:21.351 --> 04:24.286
Wait, Jane. Where are you right now?

04:24.374 --> 04:25.762
<i>I'm in Shepherd's office.</i>

04:25.811 --> 04:27.645
<i>I just sent some
photos to Patterson.</i>

04:27.692 --> 04:30.192
Look, I think I can help
you find the compound.

04:30.227 --> 04:32.061
<i>Roman let me see the
grounds this time.</i>

04:32.108 --> 04:33.794
- Why would he do that?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

04:33.834 --> 04:35.701
Maybe it's a play or maybe
he wanted me to see them,

04:35.736 --> 04:39.783
but... he said I'm not
going back to the FBI.

04:40.449 --> 04:42.971
<i>Not ever.</i>

04:43.627 --> 04:44.589
<i>Jane, listen to me.</i>

04:44.636 --> 04:46.342
There's a water tower in the distance.

04:46.391 --> 04:48.926
He took a more direct route,
took less than an hour.

04:48.996 --> 04:51.403
My head was still covered, but
I could hear a metal clanging.

04:51.449 --> 04:52.647
A clang of what?

04:52.686 --> 04:54.983
Like a... like a repetitive metal clanging.

04:54.985 --> 04:57.169
And then later, I smelled
something kind of like, um...

04:57.204 --> 04:58.685
Like what, Jane? Describe it.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.757
Like pennies and cleaning products.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.675
It looks like all of Sandstorm is here.

05:03.710 --> 05:05.763
I think the attack is happening today.

05:05.798 --> 05:09.276
<i>Roman said that it will
all be over in 12 hours.</i>

05:09.332 --> 05:13.017
- If I don't make it back, I...
- <i>You listen to me.</i>

05:13.072 --> 05:15.185
Your brother's right. This will be over.

05:15.255 --> 05:16.234
<i>We're gonna come and get you</i>

05:16.269 --> 05:18.384
<i>before we shut down
Sandstorm for good.</i>

05:21.692 --> 05:23.410
Jane's at Sandstorm right now.

05:23.464 --> 05:24.980
They're about to launch Phase Two.

05:25.043 --> 05:26.697
- What?
- Go ahead, Jane.

05:26.732 --> 05:29.284
<i>We don't have much time. They
could be back any second.</i>

05:29.286 --> 05:31.743
Okay, I'm staring at a bunch of documents

05:31.778 --> 05:34.222
- <i>and they do not look good.</i>
- Documents of what, Jane?

05:34.224 --> 05:37.099
Uh, there's like, I don't
know, um, blueprints.

05:37.134 --> 05:40.673
Looks like a satellite,
maybe, or some kind of bomb.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.259
Did you just send me a bunch of photos?

05:42.303 --> 05:43.950
Yes, yes. Did you get them?

05:44.007 --> 05:45.473
<i>This thing is taking
forever to send.</i>

05:45.508 --> 05:46.741
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.306
<i>There's also a map</i>

05:48.357 --> 05:49.757
with a lot of areas circled,

05:49.807 --> 05:54.603
and there's a construction invoice
for a hell of a lot of explosives.

05:54.657 --> 05:55.822
Okay, here we go.

05:55.879 --> 05:57.339
Whoa, how old is this phone?

05:57.402 --> 05:58.397
Wait. Hold on a second.

05:58.451 --> 06:00.418
These aren't plans for making a bomb.

06:00.465 --> 06:02.948
They're schematics for power transformers.

06:02.983 --> 06:05.654
Those circled areas...
I recognize some of them.

06:05.689 --> 06:07.311
They're transmission substations.

06:07.346 --> 06:09.779
Oh, my God.

06:09.826 --> 06:11.139
They're gonna blow up the power grid.

06:11.183 --> 06:13.350
Hold on. The chip...

06:13.430 --> 06:15.163
<i>The one Jane had to
steal with Roman.</i>

06:18.602 --> 06:20.235
What if Sandstorm is using it

06:20.301 --> 06:22.471
to override the transmission failsafes?

06:22.526 --> 06:24.294
- Meaning?
- It would be like overriding

06:24.368 --> 06:27.313
the circuit breakers in your
fuse box during a power surge.

06:27.348 --> 06:29.424
Only instead of your house,
it's the tri-state area,

06:29.459 --> 06:33.010
and instead of 240
volts, it's like 600,000.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.657
The results would be catastrophic.

06:34.705 --> 06:37.112
A surge this big could ripple
across the entire country,

06:37.170 --> 06:39.805
start fires in thousands of buildings.

06:39.841 --> 06:42.166
Before plunging us into
a permanent blackout.

06:42.201 --> 06:45.327
Sandstorm is about to send
America back into the Dark Ages.

06:51.327 --> 06:56.327
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

07:09.256 --> 07:10.653
Destroy the power grid.

07:10.736 --> 07:12.827
Jane, what else can you tell us?

07:12.895 --> 07:14.829
All right. How big is Sandstorm?

07:14.897 --> 07:16.731
I have to go, I have to go.

07:16.799 --> 07:18.564
I don't want to talk
to you about this again.

07:18.599 --> 07:20.969
I said I'll take care of it.

07:21.036 --> 07:23.037
What are you doing?

07:23.105 --> 07:28.142
I'm sick of waiting
around. This was my plan.

07:28.210 --> 07:31.412
Something's happening and I
have a right to know what it is.

07:34.283 --> 07:35.950
You're right.

07:37.820 --> 07:41.589
So, what did you find out?

07:41.657 --> 07:43.658
You're going to bomb all the power grids.

07:43.726 --> 07:46.027
Aren't you?

07:47.997 --> 07:49.931
I should have read you in sooner.

07:51.133 --> 07:53.526
I'm sorry it takes me so long

07:53.615 --> 07:57.921
to trust people I love,
but today is about victory,

07:57.956 --> 07:59.359
and I think it's only fitting

07:59.430 --> 08:04.329
that we share that victory as a family.

08:06.719 --> 08:09.033
Reade, Tasha, I want plainclothes units

08:09.101 --> 08:12.037
at every transmission station on that map.

08:12.096 --> 08:14.666
We can't count on stopping
this at the point of attack.

08:14.701 --> 08:17.166
Sandstorm may be triggering this remotely.

08:17.227 --> 08:20.281
We have to find their compound and
neutralize them before they initiate.

08:20.326 --> 08:21.426
What have you found, Patterson?

08:21.461 --> 08:23.018
The cell tower Jane's call bounced off

08:23.053 --> 08:25.273
- gave me a ten-mile search radius.
- What about the other clues she gave us?

08:25.358 --> 08:27.537
She said she heard something clanging.

08:27.584 --> 08:30.723
Based on the travel time, I'm
betting it's this oil-fracking site.

08:30.795 --> 08:33.710
Okay. And what about the pennies
and cleaning product smell?

08:33.745 --> 08:35.341
Ever driven by a slaughterhouse?

08:35.408 --> 08:38.457
Blood's got a lot of iron in it, and
cleaning it up takes a lot of ammonia.

08:38.523 --> 08:41.347
So, there are two in the
area... here and here.

08:41.405 --> 08:43.890
And one of them is near a water tower.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.797
Exactly. What does this look like?

08:45.832 --> 08:47.263
- It's a farm.
- Right.

08:47.298 --> 08:48.615
Except that, according to deeds

08:48.693 --> 08:50.715
and title records, this property is owned

08:50.750 --> 08:54.162
by someone who doesn't exist.
And there's your water tower.

08:54.252 --> 08:56.164
- We have to take it now.
- Agreed.

08:56.219 --> 08:57.406
But we have to be smart
about it, all right?

08:57.441 --> 08:59.789
Jane is still in there. I want
her back here in one piece.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.380
And I want Shepherd taken
alive for a thorough debriefing.

09:02.415 --> 09:03.381
Copy that.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.234
I got something for you.

09:11.312 --> 09:13.139
It's the same brand as the gum wrapper

09:13.207 --> 09:16.342
you gave me at the orphanage
after I lost our coin.

09:17.945 --> 09:21.347
I tracked it down. I thought
maybe we could try it together.

09:21.415 --> 09:22.982
Thanks.

09:23.050 --> 09:26.352
I, uh... I have something for you, too.

09:28.389 --> 09:30.356
Feels like you should have it back now.

09:36.096 --> 09:37.764
Thank you.

09:37.831 --> 09:40.066
For what?

09:40.134 --> 09:43.069
For trusting me.

09:43.137 --> 09:45.939
Thanks for not letting me down.

09:48.081 --> 09:50.991
Mmm. This gum tastes awful.

09:53.247 --> 09:57.317
Really? Mine's not bad.

09:57.384 --> 09:59.685
Maybe you just got a bad piece.

10:10.364 --> 10:12.999
I'm sorry about this.

10:18.672 --> 10:20.006
What's going on?

10:20.074 --> 10:21.196
Uh, nothing. It's fine.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.255
- It doesn't look fine.
- I can't... I can't really

10:23.290 --> 10:25.244
- talk about it.
- Talk about it. Right.

10:25.349 --> 10:26.956
I'll see you a little later, okay?

10:28.604 --> 10:30.773
Okay. You all know your orders.

10:30.808 --> 10:32.395
Keep the lines of communication open,

10:32.430 --> 10:34.037
the crosstalk to a minimum.

10:34.072 --> 10:35.555
Let's move.

10:40.661 --> 10:41.659
Weller.

10:41.716 --> 10:44.458
Kurt, it's Conor, Allie's boyfriend.

10:44.493 --> 10:48.111
- _
- <i>We haven't met, but, um...</i>

10:48.189 --> 10:50.625
Why are you calling me
from a hospital, Conor?

10:50.660 --> 10:53.813
Sorry. My, uh... my... my phone died.

10:53.867 --> 10:56.409
- What happened?
- Allie's been in a car accident.

10:56.477 --> 10:57.677
<i>It's not good.</i>

10:57.745 --> 10:59.912
<i>She was asking for you before she...</i>

10:59.980 --> 11:01.012
They're doing what they can,

11:01.066 --> 11:03.299
but I can't get a hold
of any of her family,

11:03.334 --> 11:05.868
<i>and she listed you as
her emergency contact.</i>

11:05.936 --> 11:09.308
As the... father of her child,

11:09.343 --> 11:12.144
<i>there are gonna be some
decisions that need to be made.</i>

11:12.199 --> 11:13.910
You need to get down here.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.145
- <i>Kurt?</i>
- I'm coming.

11:16.213 --> 11:17.413
What is it?

11:17.481 --> 11:19.549
Allie's... uh, she's
been in a car accident.

11:19.616 --> 11:21.209
- Oh, my God. Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.

11:21.244 --> 11:22.654
Kurt, go. You gotta go.

11:22.689 --> 11:25.158
We've got this, okay? I promise you.

11:25.998 --> 11:27.632
Keep me in the loop.

11:42.106 --> 11:44.507
Hello, Jane.

11:44.575 --> 11:47.677
What is this? What are you doing?

11:47.745 --> 11:51.914
The question is, what have you been doing?

11:51.982 --> 11:55.403
Let me go. Roman!

11:55.438 --> 11:57.119
Your brother can't help you now.

11:57.154 --> 11:59.355
We know you've been lying to us,

11:59.423 --> 12:03.025
that you've been working
for the FBI this whole time.

12:03.093 --> 12:06.295
Are you insane? You sent me there.

12:06.363 --> 12:09.059
I've been working for you. Roman, tell her!

12:09.106 --> 12:13.405
Stop. You're only gonna make it worse.

12:19.666 --> 12:21.310
I don't know what you
think you know, but...

12:21.345 --> 12:24.247
We don't think anything.

12:27.109 --> 12:30.178
You're not the only one
that can infiltrate the FBI.

12:30.245 --> 12:35.627
Do you really think Oscar
was your only handler?

12:35.662 --> 12:39.554
That we didn't ensure other
means of keeping tabs on you?

12:39.621 --> 12:41.589
Your loyalties?

12:43.092 --> 12:44.892
Your psychology?

12:46.123 --> 12:49.626
I'd encourage you to share anything
that you can remember about Taylor.

12:52.201 --> 12:54.135
It was right in front of you.

12:54.203 --> 12:55.759
We just keep talking in circles.

12:55.814 --> 12:58.473
You want me to tell you that it's
okay to walk away, but I won't do that.

12:58.540 --> 13:01.075
This team's the closest
thing to family you've got.

13:01.143 --> 13:02.684
I don't believe you.

13:02.723 --> 13:05.613
It doesn't matter what you believe.

13:08.884 --> 13:12.153
Dr. Borden is one of us.

13:50.903 --> 13:54.431
_

14:15.925 --> 14:18.382
What's so complicated?
She's hurt. I found her.

14:18.430 --> 14:19.799
We have an obligation to treat her.

14:19.834 --> 14:21.835
Look, I'm sorry. It's
just not as simple as that.

14:21.870 --> 14:23.853
Another few hours, she'd have been dead.

14:23.888 --> 14:26.445
- She was out there, alone.
- And that doesn't worry you?

14:26.480 --> 14:28.123
Did you see the tattoo on her shoulder?

14:28.158 --> 14:29.694
I know what a Navy SEAL tattoo looks like.

14:29.756 --> 14:31.695
Right. Then, you know the
Navy SEALS have a code...

14:31.730 --> 14:33.008
Leave no man behind.

14:33.076 --> 14:36.200
So, why was this Navy SEAL left alone
to die in the middle of an Afghan forest?

14:36.235 --> 14:38.478
We're just... we're treating a patient.

14:38.513 --> 14:40.482
Or harboring a fugitive.

14:40.517 --> 14:42.918
We have no idea who this woman is, Chris.

14:42.986 --> 14:45.421
Now, we just helped build
a perfectly good hospital.

14:45.489 --> 14:46.580
Why can't we turn her over to the proper...

14:46.635 --> 14:48.277
We're not turning this woman over to anyone

14:48.359 --> 14:51.728
until I hear what
happened to her, from her.

14:52.380 --> 14:56.065
Look, I'm just worried about you, about us.

14:56.588 --> 14:59.268
I have to help her.

15:02.973 --> 15:04.288
No, I... I have to go.

15:04.358 --> 15:05.864
It's not safe for you if I stay.

15:05.926 --> 15:07.253
- Wait. Not safe how?
- What happened to you?

15:07.288 --> 15:08.217
Is there someone we can call?

15:08.252 --> 15:10.135
Don't call anyone. Just... I have to go.

15:10.197 --> 15:12.395
She's burning up.

15:12.430 --> 15:15.251
You will die on your
own. Do you understand me?

15:15.318 --> 15:17.019
You're staying here until you're well.

15:17.087 --> 15:20.089
Please. Please.

16:00.863 --> 16:03.187
- Can we help you?
- Strategic Services Division.

16:03.222 --> 16:05.449
- We need to come inside, ma'am.
- May I ask why?

16:05.484 --> 16:07.846
There's been reports of an
insurgent hiding in the area.

16:07.881 --> 16:09.298
My husband and I spend all day

16:09.361 --> 16:11.018
cleaning up the mess you're
making of this country.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.846
You can bloody well stay out of our house.

16:12.908 --> 16:15.344
- You work at the hospital, correct?
- Yes, Doctors Without Borders.

16:15.412 --> 16:17.346
All right. We need to see your passports.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.121
Have you seen this woman, ma'am?

16:22.156 --> 16:24.440
She's an American. She may
be posing as U.S. military.

16:24.478 --> 16:25.806
How do we know you're not
posing as U.S. military?

16:25.841 --> 16:27.108
Chris.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.463
This is for your own protection, ma'am.

16:29.498 --> 16:30.812
For our own protection?

16:30.847 --> 16:32.548
Well, why don't you check the hospitals

16:32.593 --> 16:34.328
and see all the families
who've been blinded

16:34.389 --> 16:36.382
and burnt and lost limbs from the ordnance

16:36.417 --> 16:38.080
being dropped on them
for their "protection"?

16:38.119 --> 16:40.625
The insurgents are not the problem anymore.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.292
Now, I think it's time for you to leave.

16:43.327 --> 16:46.603
Listen, I want you to call
this number if you see anything.

16:48.011 --> 16:49.411
Let's go.

16:55.572 --> 16:56.739
They're gone.

16:59.222 --> 17:01.335
Whew!

17:01.370 --> 17:03.191
Come on, Granddad. You can do it.

17:03.226 --> 17:04.034
You're not funny.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.577
Oh, so I see my wife's gotten to you too.

17:08.997 --> 17:10.525
Oh, and what's this?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.185
In an unprecedented move...

17:12.227 --> 17:16.519
Well, this is what I like
to call graduation day.

17:18.364 --> 17:19.767
Graduation?

17:19.868 --> 17:22.020
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.

17:24.146 --> 17:28.056
I can't thank you and Chris enough

17:28.103 --> 17:29.669
for everything that you've done for me,

17:29.747 --> 17:31.840
but it's time for me to go.

17:31.926 --> 17:35.057
Well, I don't suppose you can
tell us what happened to you, now?

17:36.993 --> 17:38.060
Well, maybe one day.

17:45.028 --> 17:45.961
Chris?

17:47.109 --> 17:48.444
Chris.

17:48.479 --> 17:50.049
- Chris!
- No. No!

17:50.104 --> 17:52.168
Chris! Chris!

17:52.246 --> 17:54.262
Look at me! There is nothing
you can do, and the drones

17:54.297 --> 17:56.023
will be here in seconds to make sure of it!

17:56.058 --> 17:57.978
We have to go back! She
could still be alive!

17:58.042 --> 18:00.243
No! We go there, we're as dead as they are!

18:02.354 --> 18:04.807
- They're here for you.
- You can hate me later,

18:04.842 --> 18:06.762
but right now, we have to run, okay?

18:06.797 --> 18:09.603
There is a place right across the border
that we can hide, but we have to go now!

18:09.638 --> 18:12.795
Please! Come on!

18:19.152 --> 18:22.894
Oh, no, I can't... I can't go any farther.

18:22.964 --> 18:24.902
I need to rest, light a fire.

18:24.965 --> 18:27.817
No, no. We can't do that. They'll spot it.

18:27.852 --> 18:31.880
I need a minute. Just... just a minute.

18:32.172 --> 18:34.016
All right.

18:34.251 --> 18:37.352
Those were American planes.

18:37.828 --> 18:40.756
And they... and they were
dropping American bombs

18:40.843 --> 18:45.995
on a farming village and a
humanitarian aid hospital.

18:46.088 --> 18:48.690
And my wife...

18:49.030 --> 18:50.814
My wife...

18:53.905 --> 18:57.606
Maybe this was a horrible mistake.

18:57.947 --> 19:03.691
Or something is very, very wrong.

19:03.824 --> 19:05.958
It wasn't a mistake.

19:08.162 --> 19:13.392
I was part of an unsanctioned
black-ops unit called ORION.

19:13.747 --> 19:16.692
I thought I was working for the good guys,

19:16.763 --> 19:20.395
doing what was right, what
official channels couldn't.

19:20.595 --> 19:23.243
But good and right were
never the objectives...

19:23.979 --> 19:26.418
only money and power...

19:26.496 --> 19:29.873
until someone decided we were a liability,

19:29.958 --> 19:33.876
and I watched my entire team get murdered

19:34.208 --> 19:37.145
by American drones.

19:37.534 --> 19:40.710
The same ones that are doing
dead-checks in your village right now.

19:40.780 --> 19:45.721
My country has lost its mind,
and something has to change.

19:45.942 --> 19:48.957
But h-how?

19:49.157 --> 19:52.187
If we can get back to
America, we can fight back,

19:52.281 --> 19:53.674
set things right again.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.975
But I don't understand.
We're just two people.

19:57.010 --> 20:01.770
No. My family, they're already...

20:02.610 --> 20:05.974
There is always something you can do.

20:06.692 --> 20:10.412
But we have to keep moving
and we have to stand up.

20:38.966 --> 20:41.713
When did you know that I
crossed to the other side?

20:41.792 --> 20:44.410
Well, thanks to Dr. Borden,

20:44.500 --> 20:48.121
we knew you sent part of the
microchip intel to Patterson

20:48.180 --> 20:51.803
while you and Roman were
supposed to be stealing it.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.769
But we had suspicions before that.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.648
Your story...

20:57.998 --> 21:02.479
that Cade killed Oscar for Marcos.

21:02.615 --> 21:04.416
Uhh!

21:05.693 --> 21:08.291
Markos was spelled with a "K," not a "C."

21:08.326 --> 21:12.278
Cade knew that. You killed Oscar.

21:12.345 --> 21:14.065
So, you knew from the beginning.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.516
Oh, I wanted to kill you weeks ago.

21:18.807 --> 21:23.244
But your brother insisted
he could turn you back.

21:23.460 --> 21:26.729
Turns out he was wrong.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.936
There's something that I want you to see.

21:37.746 --> 21:41.551
Roman. Roman.

21:41.621 --> 21:43.476
You can't let her do this.

21:43.884 --> 21:46.479
You and I are blood,

21:46.850 --> 21:51.217
and we have always
protected each other, always.

21:51.509 --> 21:53.638
Think of what she's about to do,

21:53.732 --> 21:57.323
the lives she's about to take.

21:57.833 --> 22:00.475
I know you've been hurt. We all have.

22:00.538 --> 22:05.104
But you know this is
wrong, so help me stop her.

22:15.143 --> 22:16.977
Please.

22:19.849 --> 22:21.441
I believed in you.

22:22.682 --> 22:25.084
I fought for you.

22:25.675 --> 22:27.850
And all I got back...

22:29.823 --> 22:32.591
were lies and betrayal.

22:36.683 --> 22:39.819
It's over...

22:40.198 --> 22:41.594
"Jane."

22:49.819 --> 22:51.073
You okay?

22:51.152 --> 22:55.155
I've dedicated the past six
years to catching Sandstorm.

22:55.243 --> 22:59.515
After today, everything changes.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.205
For Jane, too.

23:01.273 --> 23:02.937
It's one thing to agree
to take down your family.

23:02.984 --> 23:05.499
It's another to watch your team
do it in front of your face,

23:05.534 --> 23:07.970
especially if they don't go down easy.

23:08.048 --> 23:09.383
One way or another,

23:09.449 --> 23:12.551
none of us are gonna
be the same after this.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.112
Allison Knight. Where is she?

23:26.167 --> 23:27.836
Ma'am, Allison Knight... where is she?

23:27.871 --> 23:28.970
All right, sir. Calm down.

23:29.025 --> 23:30.529
Look, she was just brought in.

23:30.599 --> 23:31.970
She was in a car accident.

23:32.040 --> 23:32.937
She's pregnant.

23:33.015 --> 23:34.888
We haven't received anyone by that name.

23:34.923 --> 23:37.038
This is Grace Central Hospital, right?

23:37.104 --> 23:38.973
- Yes, but we haven't had...
- Yeah. So, her boyfriend Conor.

23:39.008 --> 23:40.577
- He just called me. Co...
- Who?

23:47.265 --> 23:48.552
<i>Allie's phone.</i>

23:48.598 --> 23:50.152
- Who's this?
- <i>This is Conor.</i>

23:50.233 --> 23:52.211
- Conor, it's Kurt.
- <i>Kurt?</i>

23:52.246 --> 23:54.447
- Where's Allie?
- <i>Well, she's right here.</i>

23:54.482 --> 23:55.476
She hasn't been hurt?

23:55.546 --> 23:58.082
<i>No, Allie's fine. She's
just in the shower.</i>

23:58.169 --> 23:59.572
<i>What's going on?</i>

24:02.800 --> 24:06.349
Patterson. Patterson.
Anyone's comms working?

24:06.435 --> 24:07.397
Negative.

24:07.432 --> 24:10.183
Sandstorm must be jamming the system,
keeping this place under wraps.

24:10.261 --> 24:12.124
Then how did Jane get a call out?

24:12.224 --> 24:13.461
Good question.

24:13.547 --> 24:15.267
All right, how you want to play this?

24:15.302 --> 24:16.307
Should we abort?

24:16.371 --> 24:18.899
Look if we don't do this now,
we may never get another chance.

24:18.934 --> 24:21.789
Reade and I will go west.
Zapata, take Beta team east.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.311
And I want Jane, Roman, and
Shepherd alive. Let's go.

24:29.022 --> 24:31.462
Weller, something's wrong.
I can't reach the team.

24:31.548 --> 24:34.902
Neither can I. All right, they used
Allie as a decoy to lure me away.

24:34.937 --> 24:36.603
We have to abort this mission.

24:36.638 --> 24:37.791
You don't think Jane might have...

24:37.859 --> 24:41.761
No, I don't! All right,
I'm on my way. Send backup.

24:41.796 --> 24:44.431
Get through to the team and
make sure they stand down.

24:48.512 --> 24:52.203
I thought you might be
missing your friends.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.942
Let's see what they're doing, shall we?

24:57.029 --> 24:58.462
What is this?

25:12.268 --> 25:15.946
Did you really think we'd let you
call them if we didn't want you to?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.505
Where's Weller?

25:27.591 --> 25:29.918
We have something else planned for him.

25:30.208 --> 25:35.114
Oh, I have to thank you for
playing your part so perfectly.

25:35.149 --> 25:37.757
I mean, we couldn't have
done this without you.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.014
Done what?

25:39.101 --> 25:42.170
Phase Two isn't actually finished today,

25:42.353 --> 25:44.588
but your team is.

25:44.771 --> 25:46.070
And you're gonna watch.

25:46.105 --> 25:47.639
No. No.

25:49.871 --> 25:50.936
<i>Hear me?</i>

25:51.013 --> 25:52.706
Patterson, is that you?

25:53.822 --> 25:55.956
The scrambler is down.

25:56.312 --> 25:59.019
Why would Sandstorm turn
their scrambler off now

25:59.074 --> 26:00.916
and risk letting a signal out?

26:01.226 --> 26:02.741
So they can get a signal in.

26:02.776 --> 26:05.201
Get out! It's a trap! Move!

26:05.262 --> 26:06.803
Go! Go, go, go!

26:06.865 --> 26:07.922
No!

26:10.945 --> 26:12.427
No!

26:37.022 --> 26:38.690
Reade?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.349
Reade?

26:42.417 --> 26:44.110
Over here.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.219
You okay?

26:45.287 --> 26:47.388
No. My leg is pinned.

26:47.455 --> 26:50.177
Well, try not to move it, okay?

26:50.231 --> 26:52.969
It might be the only thing
stopping you from bleeding out.

26:54.496 --> 26:56.330
I have no cell signal.

26:56.398 --> 26:58.398
How are they gonna know we're down here?

27:01.136 --> 27:02.931
We need to start making noise.

27:06.784 --> 27:09.092
We're down too far. No
one can hear us from here.

27:09.177 --> 27:10.851
If it's piercing through the surface,

27:10.937 --> 27:12.980
maybe the sound will carry.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.785
We've got to try.

27:14.839 --> 27:16.283
Somebody help us!

27:20.985 --> 27:25.582
Oh, God. There's been an explosion.

27:25.650 --> 27:26.717
What is it?

27:26.856 --> 27:28.490
The building's come down.

27:28.597 --> 27:29.942
Major casualties.

27:30.034 --> 27:32.444
Send Search and Rescue.
And where's my backup?

27:32.507 --> 27:33.874
Dispatching.

27:35.504 --> 27:38.212
Come to me! Come to me! Come to me.

27:38.296 --> 27:39.830
Come on.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.477
Walk to the side of that
car. Just keep going.

27:42.512 --> 27:44.379
Walk away from this building.

27:45.893 --> 27:48.194
Nas! Jane!

27:50.825 --> 27:51.626
Reade!

27:51.661 --> 27:54.438
Weller, please be careful.
The rubble could collapse.

27:54.508 --> 27:56.085
There's a gas leak, Patterson.

27:56.136 --> 27:57.573
Call the utilities company.

27:57.659 --> 27:59.293
Get 'em to shut off the power and the gas.

27:59.361 --> 28:00.801
Copy. That's gonna take a minute.

28:00.859 --> 28:02.293
We haven't got it! All right?

28:02.328 --> 28:04.363
These sparks could set
off another explosion.

28:06.501 --> 28:10.871
Tasha. Tasha.

28:10.939 --> 28:15.109
Hey, hey. Tasha. You okay?

28:15.176 --> 28:16.195
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:16.230 --> 28:17.334
Yeah?

28:17.412 --> 28:18.879
Nas warned us.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.876
It's the only reason any of us got out.

28:21.911 --> 28:24.604
Where are they? Do you remember?

28:26.855 --> 28:29.663
Why? Why keep me alive?

28:29.725 --> 28:31.291
Why not just kill me with my team?

28:31.359 --> 28:34.695
Because Roman's going to kill you.

28:36.498 --> 28:37.765
What?

28:37.832 --> 28:40.302
I've lost one child already.

28:40.373 --> 28:42.540
I see the hold your sister has on you.

28:42.575 --> 28:44.143
You have to let that go.

28:46.468 --> 28:49.031
We lost her to them because
we erased her memory.

28:49.066 --> 28:52.365
- It's our fault this happened.
- But it still happened.

28:54.862 --> 28:57.964
It's time to pick a side, Roman.

29:02.213 --> 29:04.180
It's time to kill your rabbit.

29:23.266 --> 29:23.800
Help!

29:23.835 --> 29:25.796
Somebody help us!

29:25.866 --> 29:28.016
Help!

29:28.051 --> 29:30.542
- Help.
- This is hopeless.

29:36.402 --> 29:38.985
I'm sorry, Reade. This...

29:40.838 --> 29:42.853
I'm the reason that we're down here.

29:42.929 --> 29:45.400
Oh, you really need to get over yourself.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.982
I've been in this since the day
Jane crawled out of that bag.

29:49.060 --> 29:52.272
We all have.

29:52.373 --> 29:54.975
We're a team.

29:55.010 --> 29:58.345
Teams live and die for each other,

29:58.446 --> 30:00.114
like they're supposed to.

30:00.448 --> 30:03.183
So, go on and get to
banging on that damn pipe.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.350
I was actually starting to get used to it.

30:16.812 --> 30:18.079
Help!

30:25.878 --> 30:26.918
Roman...

30:26.964 --> 30:28.197
Do it.

30:28.372 --> 30:30.104
Don't do this. This isn't you.

30:30.180 --> 30:31.915
That's not your sister, Roman.

30:31.970 --> 30:33.569
I don't know who that is,

30:33.639 --> 30:35.407
but it's time to say good-bye.

30:37.559 --> 30:38.473
Now!

30:48.081 --> 30:50.049
I've lost you both.

30:52.554 --> 30:53.921
So be it.

30:57.781 --> 30:58.714
Hyah!

31:17.050 --> 31:19.238
Agh! Uhh!

31:31.398 --> 31:35.234
No! No! Roman! She's using you!

31:36.574 --> 31:39.695
Look at me. Look at me, Roman.

31:40.917 --> 31:44.502
You kill me and you kill the only person

31:44.537 --> 31:48.306
in this whole world who really loves you.

31:52.304 --> 31:55.573
Roman, we have to go. Now!

32:14.728 --> 32:17.384
Nas! Jane!

32:17.602 --> 32:18.803
Reade!

32:20.255 --> 32:21.426
Reade!

32:21.461 --> 32:22.962
Jane!

32:24.074 --> 32:26.208
What? What is it?

32:26.564 --> 32:27.998
Put your hand on this beam.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.297
Feel that?

32:31.406 --> 32:33.120
It's vibrating.

32:33.183 --> 32:34.785
Someone's alive down there.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.828
Over here!

32:37.882 --> 32:39.549
We gotta get down to them!

32:43.114 --> 32:47.546
Reade... Reade, you've got to stay awake.

32:47.617 --> 32:48.960
Be sure you tell Zapata...

32:49.009 --> 32:51.790
You can tell her yourself
when you get out, okay?

32:51.837 --> 32:55.839
You stay with me. I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?

32:56.411 --> 32:57.826
I'm going down!

33:02.043 --> 33:04.815
Help! Help! We're here!

33:04.883 --> 33:05.950
Reade...

33:07.264 --> 33:09.953
Help! Help! We're here!

33:10.597 --> 33:12.446
Reade. Reade!

33:14.613 --> 33:15.746
Come on.

33:17.898 --> 33:19.966
Help! We're here!

33:25.346 --> 33:27.764
Weller! Hurry!

33:27.859 --> 33:29.940
The gas could go off at any second!

33:33.912 --> 33:35.379
You okay?

33:37.288 --> 33:38.640
We're gonna get you out of here.

33:38.675 --> 33:41.012
Here. Take this. All right?

33:41.073 --> 33:42.845
This is the lever. Under there.

33:42.900 --> 33:45.823
On three. One, two, three.

33:50.731 --> 33:52.866
I've got to stop the bleeding.

33:55.268 --> 33:56.878
Hang on, Reade.

33:56.972 --> 33:58.317
Weller!

34:00.368 --> 34:01.571
- Got him?
- Yeah.

34:01.606 --> 34:02.737
Get ready to push.

34:02.805 --> 34:06.007
One, two, three.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.866
We've got to get them out of there.

34:10.869 --> 34:13.630
One, two, three.

34:14.627 --> 34:16.396
Nas! Get back!

34:17.889 --> 34:19.356
Nas!

34:22.965 --> 34:25.533
I'm going back for her. Take him up!

34:29.623 --> 34:31.614
Keep going! Uhh!

34:35.355 --> 34:38.520
Nas. Come here. Nas!

34:38.554 --> 34:39.877
Reade!

34:39.945 --> 34:42.452
Reade?! It's okay.

34:49.675 --> 34:51.275
All right.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.891
You okay?

34:55.100 --> 34:56.533
Wait.

34:58.067 --> 35:00.264
Go first. I've got you.

35:00.332 --> 35:03.334
Reade! Reade, don't do this to me!

35:10.227 --> 35:12.098
Come on! It's gonna blow!

35:12.177 --> 35:14.939
Go, go, go, go!

35:15.017 --> 35:18.119
Come here! Come here! No!

35:21.293 --> 35:26.255
No, no! Hey, hey! Hey... I've got you.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.024
Thank you.

35:33.608 --> 35:36.077
<i>You've reached the voicemail
of Dr. Robert Borden.</i>

35:36.112 --> 35:38.278
<i>I'm either with a patient
or away from my phone.</i>

35:38.313 --> 35:40.095
<i>Please leave a detailed message.</i>

35:40.842 --> 35:42.906
Hey, where are you?

35:43.467 --> 35:46.117
Uh, something...

35:46.187 --> 35:47.200
something really bad has happened

35:47.235 --> 35:49.910
and I could use someone
to talk to about it.

35:49.945 --> 35:54.051
Um, call me back when you get this, okay?

36:14.368 --> 36:15.474
She shot me.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.707
Come on. We've got to
take care of that wound.

36:17.742 --> 36:18.903
There you go.

36:18.965 --> 36:21.587
I just shot my mother.

36:21.647 --> 36:22.942
It's over.

36:22.977 --> 36:24.982
I can't go back.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.788
Roman, stay with me.

36:26.859 --> 36:27.948
We have to get you to a hospital.

36:27.983 --> 36:31.764
No. There's a safe house
nearby with medical supplies.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.330
- I can make it.
- No.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.800
They could find us there.

36:36.309 --> 36:38.910
I'm not going to a hospital.

36:39.165 --> 36:40.997
Either I die out here,

36:41.032 --> 36:43.867
or it's a risk we have to take.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.783
Reade, can you hear me?

37:00.420 --> 37:03.888
Come on, Reade. Can you hear me?

37:06.382 --> 37:07.649
Hey.

37:09.553 --> 37:11.506
- Hey.
- Hmm?

37:11.541 --> 37:14.598
Just... just hang in there, okay?

37:15.015 --> 37:17.611
They're getting ready
to prep you for surgery.

37:17.681 --> 37:20.638
You lost a lot of blood,
but you're gonna be fine.

37:26.625 --> 37:28.203
I really love you, you know that?

37:33.308 --> 37:35.245
There's something I have to tell you.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.169
I didn't kill Jones.

37:37.353 --> 37:39.180
- Reade, I know that.
- But I didn't save him, either.

37:39.215 --> 37:42.711
- There's nothing you could have done.
- Yeah, there was.

37:42.746 --> 37:44.073
What are you talking about?

37:44.108 --> 37:46.452
I was down in that basement,

37:46.487 --> 37:49.166
trying to work myself up...

37:49.702 --> 37:51.901
to watch that damn tape.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.976
Then I heard something upstairs,

37:59.463 --> 38:02.413
so I went to check on it,

38:02.690 --> 38:05.683
and I found him, lying on the floor...

38:06.361 --> 38:08.155
- Help me.
- ...bleeding.

38:08.233 --> 38:11.455
Please, call an ambulance.

38:12.153 --> 38:14.506
He asked me for help,

38:14.553 --> 38:16.790
and I just stood there,

38:16.861 --> 38:19.363
letting him choke on his own blood,

38:20.236 --> 38:22.337
watching him die.

38:25.299 --> 38:29.173
The autopsy was right about the timeline...

38:29.600 --> 38:31.334
and so were you.

38:33.232 --> 38:38.611
I lied to you, and I'm sorry.

38:38.697 --> 38:40.684
It's okay.

38:59.625 --> 39:02.573
Hey, I tried calling you, like, ten ti...

39:05.130 --> 39:06.779
What is that?

39:06.872 --> 39:08.633
Uh, nothing. What's wrong?

39:08.680 --> 39:11.682
My phone's been acting up.

39:18.458 --> 39:20.022
You knew Jane from before.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.588
I remembered something from my past.

39:21.623 --> 39:23.566
She feels important.

39:23.626 --> 39:25.126
I'm guessing, so did your wife?

39:25.186 --> 39:26.834
What? What are you talking about?

39:26.910 --> 39:30.964
Jane remembered a woman
with that exact, same ring.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.212
Were you married?

39:35.609 --> 39:36.805
Are you married?

39:36.840 --> 39:39.958
I'm sorry, but you're not
making any sense right now.

39:39.993 --> 39:41.323
You work for them, don't you?

39:41.358 --> 39:42.589
Work for who? I don't
know who you expect me...

39:42.624 --> 39:46.967
This whole thing was
a play for information.

39:47.002 --> 39:48.747
- You used me.
- No. No, no, no, please.

39:48.782 --> 39:51.070
They knew we were coming.
They knew everything!

39:51.140 --> 39:52.455
Please, you have to believe me. I...

39:55.000 --> 39:57.361
FBI.

39:57.475 --> 39:59.208
You're under arrest.

40:00.834 --> 40:02.399
Whoever you are.

40:02.825 --> 40:04.205
This isn't what I wanted.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.638
Yeah. I'll bet.

40:11.731 --> 40:13.875
I don't want to hurt you!

40:13.910 --> 40:16.049
It's a little late for that!

40:16.084 --> 40:18.425
You're actually pretty well stocked here.

40:18.517 --> 40:21.155
This used to be our main medical facility.

40:22.529 --> 40:25.021
This is where you were tattooed,

40:25.056 --> 40:27.471
where we erased your memory.

40:34.603 --> 40:35.946
Look, even if I can patch you up here,

40:35.981 --> 40:39.164
I can't just leave you
out here by yourself.

40:39.257 --> 40:42.031
Shepherd wants both of us dead now,

40:42.066 --> 40:44.942
and the FBI, they...

40:45.449 --> 40:49.129
- they can protect you.
- No.

40:50.343 --> 40:53.172
I'd rather die than
turn myself over to them.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.502
Well, out here alone,

40:54.537 --> 40:57.519
against Sandstorm's army, you will die.

40:58.983 --> 41:00.950
"Sandstorm."

41:02.227 --> 41:03.994
Is that what you call us?

41:06.967 --> 41:10.458
You're more than just the
killer Shepherd made you.

41:12.751 --> 41:15.538
We shared the same awful childhood...

41:15.573 --> 41:17.408
the same awful mother.

41:18.029 --> 41:20.778
We've both done awful things, but...

41:22.165 --> 41:23.558
I've changed.

41:23.636 --> 41:25.198
I'm not that person anymore,

41:25.233 --> 41:27.675
and I know that you can change, too.

41:27.738 --> 41:29.800
Save your breath.

41:29.879 --> 41:33.126
I should have pulled the trigger
on you when I had the chance.

41:33.756 --> 41:35.512
If you're smart,

41:35.574 --> 41:38.292
you'll get as far away from me as possible.

41:38.339 --> 41:43.040
No... I'll never leave you.

41:43.075 --> 41:45.269
You're my brother.

41:45.724 --> 41:47.275
And we're the same.

41:47.376 --> 41:48.820
I know that.

41:50.501 --> 41:53.344
There's only one difference between us.

41:53.907 --> 41:56.408
When you injected me with that drug,

41:57.815 --> 42:00.617
when I lost all of my memories,

42:01.168 --> 42:03.580
I got the chance to start over again...

42:07.146 --> 42:09.116
and now, you will too.

42:33.838 --> 42:34.938
Roman!

42:53.902 --> 42:56.514
Whoa, whoa. Please, don't shoot.

42:56.576 --> 42:58.264
Now, let me explain everything.

42:58.341 --> 43:00.381
I never meant to...
