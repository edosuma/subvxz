00:56.848 --> 00:59.522
The guy I just saved is a cop.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.070
That's not the usual way I do things,

01:02.145 --> 01:06.901
but sometimes you gotta abandon
your principles and do what's right.

01:06.984 --> 01:10.659
Here's the story.
This is the way it went down.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.357
- Shit!
- You okay?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.185
You made me spill my fucking coffee!

01:41.310 --> 01:45.031
Agh. Now it's gonna look like
I pissed in my pants. God damn it.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.278
The way you whipped around that cat,
you don't even like cats.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.281
I got no problem with cats.
I don't like dander.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.705
So you almost roll your car trying not to
hit one out of 600 million cats in the world?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.327
It's bad luck killing a cat.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.701
Pretty good reflexes for an old guy.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.003
I got your old guy.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.742
You ready?

02:32.444 --> 02:34.162
Louis is ready.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.370
Let's go to work.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.283
Oh, my God. Who do I have to fuck
to get you two assbags to...

04:42.365 --> 04:44.459
Sir, if we could just come in for a minute.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.214
I don't give a shit about your badge, man.

04:46.745 --> 04:47.962
You got a fucking warrant?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.632
'Cause I'm paying a grand a night
for this suite, and I'm about to get laid.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.382
So if you ain't room service and you ain't got
a warrant, then you can go fuck yourselves.

04:55.378 --> 04:59.008
Keep your fucking pants on!
Well, what the fuck is this?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.727
I'm gonna have your job, tough guy.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.979
I still don't see any paper, which means
you got no legal authority to be here.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.106
You must not like your job much,
huh, shithead?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.732
Right now, I'm loving it.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.569
Ah!

05:21.696 --> 05:23.323
Don't forget to get
his watch and wallet.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.407
Right.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.369
Needs to look like a break-in.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.346
I didn't see a thing!
I don't even know the guy!

05:53.979 --> 05:55.276
- No!

06:03.113 --> 06:04.330
Ahh!

06:10.996 --> 06:12.088
Hey!

06:14.082 --> 06:15.129
Get him off me!

06:16.084 --> 06:17.210
Get him off!

06:20.630 --> 06:22.098
Let's go.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.096
- Who was in the shower?
- A hooker.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.060
And?

06:27.095 --> 06:29.974
And I handled it. Wanna say goodbye?

06:30.724 --> 06:31.941
Fucker!

06:51.786 --> 06:53.413
- What's bothering you?
- Nothing.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.715
Come on,
somethings got your panties in a knot.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.542
Why else are we gonna go meet
Ronnie Earl in public?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.425
Yeah, I don't trust that redneck prick,
that's why.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.927
Job's done. Went fine, no problem.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.500
Why don't you do me a favour?

07:05.175 --> 07:07.894
When we get our dough,
why don't you go away a while?

07:07.969 --> 07:10.939
Take a vacation, maybe go up river,
see your mother.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.357
You wanna clue me in?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.313
I didn't shoot that hooker.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.196
No!

07:20.148 --> 07:22.367
Jesus. She saw you?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.786
- Yeah, but she ain't gonna say nothing.
- How do you know?

07:24.861 --> 07:27.159
'Cause she's more afraid of us than the cops,
that's why.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.874
So it's all good?

07:35.705 --> 07:38.549
- Yeah, it's all good.
- Yeah?

07:38.917 --> 07:40.089
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.998
Hey, y'all, what do you need?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.694
Miller Lite, and a whisky for my friend.

08:05.777 --> 08:06.869
You got a preference?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.785
- Double Bulleit.
- What's that?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.992
Some kind of whisky nobody's ever heard of.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.169
Why don't you bring your own bottle?

08:14.244 --> 08:17.919
Give him the best bourbon you got,
hot stuff, and don't be gone too long.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.505
That sound as desperate as I think it did?

08:21.584 --> 08:23.882
Yeah, don't worry about it,
you're a real Casanova.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.058
Ronnie Earl's late.
I'm not waiting around for that loser.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.769
The drinks are coming, relax.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.186
I'm gonna go to the can.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.068
If he ain't here by the time I get back,
we're out of here.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.649
- Right?
- Yeah, okay.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.490
- Oh! Sorry about that.
- What the fuck?

09:39.037 --> 09:40.163
Disgusting.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.218
What's up?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.492
Jesus! You motherfucker!

10:50.233 --> 10:52.577
I've been arrested 26 times.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.034
I went to trial four times.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.659
I got convicted twice.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.081
Nowadays, what I'm doing,
I just think of it as a business.

11:04.998 --> 11:09.299
The people I work for are shit.
And the people I take out are worse.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.096
I got some rules. No women, no children.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.180
Half the money in advance,
and half when the job is done.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.431
Don't trust anybody.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.767
That's how you stay in the game.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.689
And on this one, the game got rough.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.636
<i>You have one message.</i>

11:55.715 --> 11:57.388
<i>Detective Kwon, McKay here.</i>

11:57.467 --> 11:59.435
<i>The local PD has agreed to take you
down to the morgue</i>

11:59.510 --> 12:01.888
<i>and show you Greely's body
and personal effects.</i>

12:01.971 --> 12:04.895
<i>Whatever got him killed, he must've
been close to something sensitive.</i>

12:04.974 --> 12:06.897
<i>We definitely need you to sort this out.</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:09.229
<i>Since the case has the potential
to get touchy with the feds,</i>

12:09.312 --> 12:13.112
<i>we want to maintain radio silence on the
situation until you have some real answers.</i>

12:13.191 --> 12:14.534
<i>Good luck.</i>

12:16.319 --> 12:20.574
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm looking for a Lieutenant Lebreton.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.125
Yeah, he's right in that office.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.452
Thank you.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.418
I was in the shower for 30 minutes.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.550
- Thirty minutes?
- About 30 minutes.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.301
Lieutenant?

12:32.669 --> 12:34.171
Hi, Detective Taylor Kwon.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.756
I went to the hotel.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.279
The client asked me to take a shower.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.891
- And then those guys came.
- And what were they looking for?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.274
They wanted my client.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.943
They wanted to kill him.
That's what they came to do.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.187
But I don't get a good look at them.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.654
I can't identify them.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.266
Two guys whacked him.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.700
Looks like a drug deal gone bad,

12:59.779 --> 13:02.373
but the truth is, we don't know shit,
so anything's possible.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.788
They didn't kill the hooker
that Greely was with.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.711
These guys are pros,
I don't know why they'd leave a witness.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.460
That's her. Russian.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.181
I thought all the Russian hookers
went to L.A., New York, or Vegas.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.887
I get into the shower, I told you already.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.299
Is this the first time
you saw that client?

13:25.805 --> 13:26.977
What do you know about Mr Greely?

13:27.056 --> 13:31.027
Ex-WDCPD, Detective grade.
For about six months, he was my partner.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.648
He was kicked off the force
in complete disgrace.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.071
Cop gone real bad. Drunk, gambling.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.198
He stole evidence from a case
he was working.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.597
- We still don't know what it was.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.619
<i>- Detective?</i>
- Taylor here.

13:44.699 --> 13:48.124
<i>We ran Henry Hank Greely back through
NCIC for recent known associates</i>

13:48.202 --> 13:50.671
<i>and came up with several reports
of a possible relationship</i>

13:50.747 --> 13:54.172
<i>with local career criminal
and protection racketeer Baby Jack Lemoyne.</i>

13:54.250 --> 13:56.423
<i>- So far, that's it.</i>
- Right, I'll check in later.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.342
Who's this guy?

13:59.422 --> 14:02.346
Louis Blanchard, local lowlife, hitman.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.458
Somebody punched his ticket
while he was drinking a beer.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.560
- You got an estimated time?
- Just about midnight.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.214
<i>- DCPD.</i>
- Yeah, it's Taylor here.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.361
<i>Yes, Detective?</i>

14:14.437 --> 14:16.610
Get me a speed check
on a Louis Blanchard, local.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.191
<i>- Blanchard.</i>
- Reputed hitman.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.151
- Get me any known associates.
<i>- Right.</i>

14:20.234 --> 14:22.157
Somebody took him out a couple hours
after Greely last night.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.830
Murder weapon was a five-inch blade
with a three-inch curvature,

14:24.906 --> 14:26.186
mainly used for gutting animals.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.201
The strikes were almost surgical.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.127
Deflated both lungs, punctured the heart.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.129
<i>Detective Kwon,
we've come up with two hits.</i>

14:32.205 --> 14:35.584
<i>Louis Blanchard, 37 years old
with a long list of priors.</i>

14:35.666 --> 14:39.512
<i>Blanchard is a known associate of
one James Bonomo, AKA Jimmy Bobo,</i>

14:39.587 --> 14:42.636
<i>suspected hitman, 26 arrests,
two convictions.</i>

14:42.715 --> 14:46.345
<i>I'll send you his current contact information
via local parole board database.</i>

14:46.427 --> 14:47.804
- Right.
<i>- That's all for now.</i>

14:47.887 --> 14:48.979
And thanks.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.566
So this guy, Louis Blanchard,

14:51.641 --> 14:55.236
is a known associate
of a James Bonomo, AKA Jimmy Bobo.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.781
They worked together and they possibly
fit the profile of Greely's killers.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.536
Very good. You get all that off your cell?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.324
So I take it we're looking
for this Jimmy Bobo?

15:03.486 --> 15:06.846
My homicide division is more than capable
of handling this matter, without your help.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.328
You know, I think I'll stick around for a while.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.743
Hold on. You packing?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.696
Bet you don't have a Crescent City
carry permit, do you?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.852
<i>Nobody's here. Leave a message.</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:39.690
Hello, Jimmy. Name's Taylor Kwon.
I'm from out of state...

15:40.189 --> 15:43.944
<i>...following up on the death of a Hank Greely,
former associate of mine.</i>

15:44.026 --> 15:47.326
<i>I think Louis Blanchard's murder
ties into all this.</i>

15:47.405 --> 15:49.123
<i>If you're interested in hearing some more,</i>

15:49.198 --> 15:52.122
<i>meet me at the St. Charles Saloon
in three hours.</i>

16:03.212 --> 16:06.967
It's easy to get
sentimental about things.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.426
Louis was a big boy.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.434
He knew, he took his chances.

16:12.513 --> 16:16.188
I worked with him the last six years,
he never caused me a problem.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.572
But still, we did our job

16:22.315 --> 16:24.113
and we got set up.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.753
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I need a rock glass.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.415
You know, this is a bar,
you can't bring in your own bottle.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.590
You carry Bulleit Bourbon?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.216
No.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.253
Yeah, well, I do.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.424
Here's 20 bucks to rent a glass.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.261
All right.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.479
<i>Salud.</i>

17:06.150 --> 17:07.902
You're a cop, right?

17:09.487 --> 17:12.457
Taylor Kwon, WDCPD.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.624
Look, this isn't a sting. I'm alone.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.709
I wouldn't be here if you weren't.

17:21.249 --> 17:25.049
So I figure you and Louis Blanchard
take out Hank Greely last night.

17:25.127 --> 17:29.303
Couple hours later,
you walk into some type of double cross.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.180
Louis goes down, you make it out.

17:31.926 --> 17:35.556
The only part of this story I can't figure out
is why you guys let the hooker live.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.480
When I'm done with this drink,
I'm gonna be done with you.

17:40.977 --> 17:44.652
Hank Greely was an ex-cop.
Washington, D.C.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.983
I'm on the case.

17:48.901 --> 17:53.873
Look, I'm not really interested
in some disposable hired hitter, no of fence.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.333
I want the guys who did the hiring.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.003
You know,
the same guys who took out your partner.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.711
They probably held out on you.
Owe you some money?

18:02.790 --> 18:05.043
Let's work together.
We can help each other out.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.838
I don't work with cops.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.175
Is that it?

18:14.010 --> 18:15.227
That's it.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.995
You change your mind, give me a call.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.442
Why don't you have a drink for Louis?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.641
That's probably the only thing
you'll ever do for him.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.498
Ahh!

21:09.018 --> 21:10.110
They're cops.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.506
Dead cops. And you're gonna be dead, too,
if you don't get in here and get fixed up.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.986
Come on.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.618
The cops are gonna be here any second.
They're gonna take your ass in.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.250
Cops aren't gonna help you.
You clipped one of them.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.002
Plus, you got another one
laying over there somewhere.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.206
And they're both rogue.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.626
They're all not gonna be like that.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.054
The pistol you used to kill that cop's
got your fingerprints all over it.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.724
Got two choices.
You come with me and get fixed up,

21:40.508 --> 21:43.603
or you get out here and wait for the cops.
Your choice.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.603
Make up your mind.
My fucking arm's getting tired.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.246
Mr Keegan!

22:09.119 --> 22:11.542
I'm told you had a bit of a problem last night.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.005
A little unfinished business. I'll find him.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.261
That scumbag Greely knew

22:17.336 --> 22:20.306
he needed some kind of insurance policy
in order to blackmail us.

22:20.381 --> 22:24.386
So he found Baby Jack and he gave him
his evidence file for safekeeping,

22:24.927 --> 22:27.271
all of it proving
that we paid off a congressman

22:27.346 --> 22:29.724
to steer a government contract our way.

22:31.267 --> 22:35.693
We have an informant inside his crew.
He gave us the location of the file.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.648
I want you to destroy it.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.512
Okay, so, we are done.

23:04.592 --> 23:08.517
Just keep this wrapped for 24 hours.
A&D twice a day for a week.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.143
Otherwise, no direct sunlight.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.977
Keep it dry and absolutely no scratching.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.959
- So what are we doing here?
- Getting matching tattoos.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.169
Piss off, asshole.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.341
Move your leg.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.181
Piss off?

23:53.223 --> 23:56.773
You came to me. You asked me for help.
I thought about it and I said, "No."

23:56.852 --> 23:59.776
Then I see all these guys trying to kill you,
and I figure we're in the same boat.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.905
But let's get something straight,
either we do it my way or we don't do it at all!

24:28.759 --> 24:30.181
Hey, Lisa.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.234
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.404
I gotta talk to you a second, though.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.235
It's been a while.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.616
A girl gets lonely.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.069
- I know. I'm sorry.
- You know?

24:46.151 --> 24:47.323
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.535
Are you, um, in trouble?

24:50.614 --> 24:53.367
No, I'm good. I'm good.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.373
I need your help with something.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.122
There's a guy out in the car. He's been shot.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.423
This guy's bleeding,
I don't know how bad it is,

25:00.499 --> 25:03.093
but I can't take him to a real doctor.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.713
Lisa, I gotta keep this one alive.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.970
I told you before, I'm not in that business.
I never was.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.227
This is the last time.
I'm sorry, I'll never do this again.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.604
Homicide, Lebreton.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.489
Lieutenant, it's Detective Taylor Kwon.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.859
<i>Look, I'm still in Crescent City.</i>

25:26.942 --> 25:28.535
Yeah, well, you enjoying your vacation?

25:28.610 --> 25:30.863
<i>- This is a courtesy call, Lieutenant.</i>
- Kwon.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.707
<i>I'm still working the Greely case
until I hear otherwise from my boss.</i>

25:33.782 --> 25:36.142
Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me.
Did you find anything?

25:36.285 --> 25:37.912
Yeah, I got a source.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.995
He's gonna lead me to the guys
who took out Greely.

25:40.247 --> 25:43.126
I bring him in, he’s just gonna lawyer up
and then you got nothing.

25:45.377 --> 25:49.348
I gotta go. I'll talk to you later, okay?
I'll keep checking in.

25:54.303 --> 25:57.728
No. This guy, no, he doesn't look like
one of your usual lowlife buddies.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.977
He's a cop.
I made the mistake of saving his life.

26:02.853 --> 26:03.945
Well, that's a first.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.314
Hmm.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.067
All right, whatever, let's get him in.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.777
TAYLOR; Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.324
What kind of doctor are you?

26:11.820 --> 26:14.220
She did a year in med school.
It's the best you're gonna get.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.768
Have some of this. You'll thank me later.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.753
Have you done this before?

26:43.852 --> 26:45.479
- Yeah, a couple times.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.859
Gee, that's too bad.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.704
Jimmy's friends occasionally have
some problems.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.202
I'm Lisa.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.084
Taylor. Taylor Kwon!

27:00.327 --> 27:01.374
There it is.

27:01.870 --> 27:02.962
Okay.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.424
So, how'd this happen?

27:06.917 --> 27:10.012
Did Jimmy do it?
He doesn't like cops very much.

27:10.087 --> 27:14.058
Well, I don't like crooks very much.
The feeling's mutual.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.557
You mind telling me why
you're getting involved in this?

27:19.721 --> 27:20.893
It's complicated.

27:21.682 --> 27:22.899
Are you gonna arrest him?

27:24.226 --> 27:25.626
Well, he's a criminal and a killer.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.152
Yeah, who I guess saved your life.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.241
It's just a scratch, right?

27:35.737 --> 27:39.913
I still have to clean him up, stitch him up.
Then you can have him.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.913
Give him a Band-Aid and a blow pop.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.145
We're closed.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.603
Private club. Just got some friends here.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.896
Can I help you, buddy?

28:06.518 --> 28:08.361
You looking for Baby Jack?

28:11.982 --> 28:13.859
What the shit was that about?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.627
Open the safe.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.473
Thank you.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.499
Get the fuck out!

29:09.206 --> 29:10.298
You're fucking dead!

29:48.203 --> 29:52.879
This little number you pulled tonight
may turn out to be the stuff of legend.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.845
Mr Greely thought he was so smart
to hide the file with an associate.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.631
Job well done.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.300
I had the advantage of surprise.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.470
Your false modesty is apparent.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.064
You enjoy your work.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.986
Fascinating reading.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.571
All the terrible things I've done.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.493
But huge amounts of money

30:24.823 --> 30:26.791
can lead a man to temptation.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.591
- I hear you're gonna live.
- Yeah, well, seven stitches.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.838
Could have been worse.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.130
Yeah, she said take these.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.722
- What are they?
- Extract of white tiger juice.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.977
Put a little pound in your pencil there, pal.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.979
White tiger juice, my ass.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.808
What about the good old
"Asians Can't Drive" joke?

30:50.891 --> 30:53.485
You guys can't drive, that's a fact.
No doubt about it.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.607
So that tattoo doctor?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.237
- Yeah.
- She seems okay.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.489
Yeah, she's okay.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.048
Kind of makes you an odd couple, huh?

31:03.403 --> 31:04.764
Yeah, you trying to say something?

31:05.113 --> 31:06.911
What? Whatever, you know.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.493
She chooses to be with you, you must be
giving her something she needs.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.419
Yeah, she's my daughter.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.588
How'd you ever make detective?

31:21.046 --> 31:22.806
You know that tattoo
on your daughter's back?

31:23.131 --> 31:25.651
It's very similar to the one on the hooker
that was with Greely.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.767
Don't tell me you're calling my daughter
a hooker. Don't even go there.

31:28.929 --> 31:33.480
What I'm trying to say is that maybe the
similar tattoos is why you didn't kill her.

31:34.309 --> 31:38.314
It was some sentimental,
dopey identification crap

31:38.397 --> 31:40.037
between, you know, her and your daughter.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.363
What are you, a cop or a shrink?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.371
So, who hired you to take out Greely?

31:46.446 --> 31:48.566
In my line of work,
we generally go through a handler.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.667
This time, it was this jerk named Ronnie Earl.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.331
You talk to this Earl yet?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.084
No, I can't find him.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.242
- What about you? What do you got?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.963
- Well, so far, I got you.
- Great.

31:59.668 --> 32:00.760
<i>DCPD.</i>

32:00.836 --> 32:03.430
Give me a speed check on a Ronnie,
AKA Ronald Earl.

32:03.505 --> 32:04.882
<i>- Earl.</i>
- Crescent City local.

32:04.965 --> 32:07.388
<i>- Right.</i>
- Now you're doing your job.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.907
You know, we'll figure this thing out,
then we'll go get them.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.054
Get them and what?

32:11.138 --> 32:13.140
- Then take them out.
- No, you mean take them in.

32:13.223 --> 32:14.645
Right, take them in. Whatever.

32:15.183 --> 32:16.526
How am I supposed to trust you?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.946
I don't know.
Why don't you read some fucking tea leaves?

32:20.021 --> 32:22.740
That might work. You know,
I save your life, I get your wound fixed.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.534
Now what do you want, a ring?

32:25.861 --> 32:26.953
Yeah?

32:27.028 --> 32:28.746
<i>DCPD, we got a Ronald Earl.</i>

32:28.822 --> 32:29.869
Man, you're aggravating.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.703
- Ronnie Earl AKA Cowboy Ronnie.
- Yeah, that's right. Cowboy Ronnie.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.959
35, born in El Paso. Six feet tall.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.961
- Right. Where is he?
- Brown hair, blue eyes.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.792
<i>- Priors, grand theft auto...</i>
- Car thief.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.216
He's a scumbag. Who gives a shit?
Where is he?

32:43.295 --> 32:44.775
He was busted twice in Oklahoma City.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.215
- Total loser.
- Illegal possession of firearms.

32:47.424 --> 32:51.770
And we got a hit on his credit card
at a place called Maison de Santé?

32:51.845 --> 32:53.347
It's a Turkish bath house
in the French Quarter?

32:53.430 --> 32:54.556
I know exactly where it is.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.392
<i>- That's all for now.</i>
- All right, thanks.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.567
Yeah.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.520
Let's go take a bath.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.991
<i>The Crescent City crime wave took an even
more violent turn earlier this evening</i>

33:04.065 --> 33:07.365
<i>with the murder of Baby Jack Lemoyne
and eight of his henchmen</i>

33:07.444 --> 33:10.618
<i>at their Algiers restaurant bar,
The French Lick.</i>

33:10.697 --> 33:13.325
<i>Lemoyne has long been considered
a major racketeer</i>

33:13.408 --> 33:15.251
<i>in the Crescent City underworld scene.</i>

33:15.869 --> 33:20.295
<i>Police suspect a rival gang in the Algiers
area of committing the vicious murders</i>

33:20.373 --> 33:23.673
<i>and say it looked like an invasion
of at least five assailants.</i>

33:23.752 --> 33:25.971
<i>I'm Wanda Burton for Channel Two News.</i>

33:52.489 --> 33:53.866
He made a 10:00 appointment.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.744
Charged an hour on his MasterCard.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.044
Hmm.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.293
You're one of them phone guys, huh?

34:01.122 --> 34:02.522
Yeah, I can't do my job without it.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.186
You know, I could use this as a weapon?

34:05.418 --> 34:07.591
I could jam your throat, hit your temple.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.797
And, bang, you'd be toast.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.933
And I just sit there, right?

34:15.011 --> 34:19.107
Yeah, I could break this glass and use it
as a cutting edge. Never see me coming.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.480
Or I could use the lithium battery
to poison your drink.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.404
You know, drop it in your coffee.
You won't even taste it.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.824
And I can kill you with this piece of apple.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.068
Yeah, right. How would you do that?

34:33.822 --> 34:34.869
Distraction.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.534
Hmm?

34:39.995 --> 34:42.589
This was Louis' knife. Nice, huh?

34:45.125 --> 34:47.002
You stay here and listen to the radio.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.505
Whoa, whoa, wait. That's bullshit.
I found him, I'm going in.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.966
In my town, we'll do it my way.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.891
Hey, you got 10 minutes,
and then I'm coming...

36:11.419 --> 36:15.765
Now I want you to sit over there
and keep your mouth shut. Forever, okay?

36:17.342 --> 36:18.639
Forever.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.494
Are we gonna do this or what?

36:37.320 --> 36:39.322
Sure, anytime.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.253
You set me up, Ronnie,
and you got Louis killed.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.126
No. That ain't what happened, bro.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.167
Why don't we just cut the bullshit, bro?
What about the client?

36:50.542 --> 36:52.294
I never ask that shit. You know that.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.505
My guy hears from a guy
who hears from a guy.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.055
Who owes me money?

36:56.131 --> 36:59.260
I don't know, but they owe me, too.
All right? I still haven't gotten paid.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.936
What about Louis? You set him up.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.895
No way, Bobo. Not a chance.
Louis was my boy.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.351
Your boy.

37:07.434 --> 37:08.651
Now, look.

37:09.644 --> 37:13.148
That client took him out, I say we go
find that fucker and get us both paid.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.734
That's a good idea.
Why don't you get dressed?

37:35.128 --> 37:36.846
Guns don't kill people,

37:38.381 --> 37:40.008
bullets do.

37:40.717 --> 37:41.843
You made two big mistakes.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.304
You should have checked the weight,

37:44.387 --> 37:47.561
and you should have never tried to burn me.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.812
- Baptiste.
- Mm-hmm.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.149
All right, that's the brother's name,
Marcus Baptiste!

37:55.231 --> 37:57.351
He's a lawyer,
and he's got an office down in the CBD,

37:57.358 --> 38:00.238
and he's got a big old fucking mansion
in the Garden District, all right?

38:00.361 --> 38:02.034
Baptiste.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.747
How much for this to go away?
Give me a number.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.205
Well, I was robbed,

38:07.786 --> 38:09.083
and Louis was clipped.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.627
100 grand?

38:11.956 --> 38:13.333
100 grand?

38:14.501 --> 38:17.345
You know, Louis was a little oobatz,
a little crazy, but I liked him.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.763
I liked him a lot.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.431
He was my partner.

38:21.174 --> 38:22.346
All right, 500 grand!

38:22.425 --> 38:24.785
Come on, that's a lot of cheese,
but I could live with that!

38:24.886 --> 38:25.978
I can't!

38:26.054 --> 38:28.022
- Jimmy, no, no, no, no! Jimmy, no!

38:28.097 --> 38:29.440
Oh, my God! Fuck!

38:29.974 --> 38:31.897
No, no!

39:52.932 --> 39:54.275
So, did you find Ronnie Earl?

39:54.350 --> 39:56.273
- It's none of your business.
- Well, what did he say?

39:56.352 --> 39:57.524
I got a problem with you.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.072
- Don't touch my gun!

39:59.606 --> 40:02.826
What the hell were you thinking,
taking the firing pin out of my piece?

40:02.901 --> 40:03.993
- Okay.
- Huh?

40:05.111 --> 40:07.534
Okay, all right.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.684
Maybe it was a mistake, all right?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.618
Mistake?
- Yeah.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.248
But I'm a cop.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.422
You know, I can't let you go
on some fucking killing spree!

40:15.496 --> 40:17.715
Yeah? Well, it's gonna get worse.
If you can't handle it, go home!

40:17.790 --> 40:19.792
Hey, fuck you!

40:19.876 --> 40:23.676
You know, if it wasn't for me, you'd still be
scratching your ass looking for Ronnie Earl.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.890
If we're gonna find the guys
that killed Louis and Greely,

40:28.968 --> 40:31.346
then we gotta work together on this!

40:34.515 --> 40:36.734
You had me at "fuck you." Come on!

40:41.105 --> 40:44.530
Next bum we gotta get is a lawyer
named Marcus Baptiste. I heard of him.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.371
Seen his name in the paper, big shot type.
We'll see.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.749
<i>- DCPD.</i>
- Yeah, it's Taylor Kwon.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.871
<i>Yes, Detective?</i>

40:52.951 --> 40:55.045
Get me a speed check on a Marcus Baptiste,

40:55.119 --> 40:56.621
- local lawyer, ASAP.
<i>- Baptiste.</i>

40:56.704 --> 40:57.876
<i>- Right.</i>
- All right, thanks.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.508
What's so funny?

41:01.584 --> 41:04.633
It's been a long time
since I cracked out a cop.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.135
- Bang, down, owned.
- Owned?

41:09.425 --> 41:12.099
- It's Taylor here.
<i>- DCPD regarding Marcus Baptiste.</i>

41:12.178 --> 41:13.430
There's a pen down there.

41:14.681 --> 41:18.561
Marcus Baptiste, 5305 Britania.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.066
- All right, got it, thanks.
- Great.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.451
You were in the Navy, right?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.704
- You were in demolitions?
- Yeah.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.452
Early discharge. No benefits.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.834
Never did find enough evidence
to court martial you

41:34.909 --> 41:36.877
for that C-4 you sold on the black market.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.251
How do you know all that stuff?
With that phone?

41:39.330 --> 41:43.005
Exactly. I ran your file through NCIC.

41:43.084 --> 41:47.760
High school dropout, military service,
arrest record, prison time.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.266
Yeah, you can find all of that on one of these.

41:50.591 --> 41:54.141
May want to upgrade from carrier pigeons
or whatever early man uses.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.347
You gotta stop busting my chops.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.525
And that C-4 case,
someone else confessed to it,

41:59.600 --> 42:02.524
but I guess you ain't gonna find that
on my records, are you?

42:02.603 --> 42:05.643
You still did enough fucked up shit
to spend the rest of your life in prison.

42:05.690 --> 42:10.696
That ain't gonna happen,
but I like your spirit, that Samurai thing,

42:10.778 --> 42:12.075
it's nice.

42:12.989 --> 42:16.209
First of all, Samurai is Japanese, I'm Korean.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.331
Got it.

42:17.410 --> 42:21.131
That's like me saying
my favourite Italian food are tacos.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.792
That's kind of a stupid analogy.

42:36.971 --> 42:40.475
Wow.
Looks like Baptiste is having a party.

42:41.851 --> 42:43.853
You know,
costumes could work to our advantage.

42:44.479 --> 42:47.107
Slip in and grab him
where he can't make a scene.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.567
Got it covered.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.618
- Hey, how are you?
- Hello.

43:38.991 --> 43:40.151
We'd love for you to join us.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.429
Baptiste, wonderful party!

43:56.509 --> 43:58.477
Hey! There you are.
I was just looking for you.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.305
Why don't the two of you meet me
in the back bedroom there,

44:00.388 --> 44:02.607
we'll play the fox and the hound together
a little bit.

44:02.682 --> 44:04.402
- That's our guy.
- Enjoy yourself.

44:05.143 --> 44:06.395
Wait here.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.021
Hey, kids!

44:09.147 --> 44:10.524
Wonderful party, thank you!

44:11.691 --> 44:14.035
Look at you! Looking great, baby!

44:14.443 --> 44:16.241
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.617
- Come to me, princess.
- Fabulous.

44:21.701 --> 44:23.374
Yes, baby. Oh.

44:26.414 --> 44:27.506
Ha-ha! Darling!

44:27.582 --> 44:30.335
- Easter Bunny, how's it going?
- Good to see you!

44:30.418 --> 44:31.886
Gonna keep getting naughtier.

44:33.045 --> 44:34.763
Keep getting crazier.

44:59.655 --> 45:05.082
Gentlemen, despite the reverses
and calamities of the recent past,

45:05.620 --> 45:10.547
we believe that this city still has
a bright economic future.

45:11.626 --> 45:16.427
What we're going to do is
knock these ghetto housing projects flat

45:16.964 --> 45:22.221
and replace them with safe, modern,
prestigious condominiums.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.854
Ah. Gentlemen, our host, Mr Baptiste.

45:27.934 --> 45:29.060
Good evening.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.023
Hope you gentlemen spend some time
at the party.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.651
Pleasure, pleasure.

45:34.774 --> 45:37.197
To our potential success. Cheers.

45:37.443 --> 45:38.990
- Cheers.
- Need anything?

45:40.655 --> 45:42.532
A little privacy, right now.

45:43.115 --> 45:46.085
And a little more whisky,
if you can arrange it.

45:50.456 --> 45:51.673
Gentlemen.

46:01.676 --> 46:04.099
- Hey, Tiffany!
- Yes, Mr Baptiste?

46:04.178 --> 46:05.771
- Morel wants some more whisky.
- All right.

46:05.846 --> 46:09.225
- Hey, you know what? Fuck him.
- Mr Baptiste.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.776
Gonna piss in his cup.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.731
Any drugs in here?

46:33.708 --> 46:35.802
Grip it and zip it, party boy.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.594
What the fuck is this, a joke?

46:42.341 --> 46:44.059
Nah, it ain't no joke.

46:56.856 --> 46:57.903
Yeah.

46:57.982 --> 47:00.155
Meet me by the staircase
at the rear of the house.

47:00.234 --> 47:01.360
Okay, I'll be right there.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.374
I thought you were
just gonna talk to him.

47:11.454 --> 47:13.377
I know, I know.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.523
So, where are we going
for this interrogation?

47:31.599 --> 47:33.852
My hit-the-mattress joint,
it's an old boathouse.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.687
Hey, just don't give me any crap,
I'm not in the mood right now.

47:36.771 --> 47:38.523
What's your problem?

47:38.606 --> 47:40.700
I saw the guy that killed Louis
back at the party.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.449
I wanted to take him out,
but there's too many witnesses.

47:46.614 --> 47:47.706
He's still out.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.409
If he wakes up, just crack him.

47:49.492 --> 47:51.093
What, are you kidding? He's totally out.

47:51.118 --> 47:53.291
Plus he's drunk, what's he gonna do?

47:57.792 --> 47:59.794
Jesus Christ!

48:07.009 --> 48:08.181
Get off!

48:14.517 --> 48:15.939
Nice going, Odd Job!

48:16.018 --> 48:18.396
Good call.

48:18.479 --> 48:21.824
You know, I give you one thing,
one thing to do!

48:27.738 --> 48:32.369
You let two unknown men
enter this house uninvited.

48:32.952 --> 48:35.671
Then you allow them to take the owner,

48:35.746 --> 48:40.593
and then, unmolested,
they drive off into the middle of the night.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.427
That's a little unfair.

48:46.507 --> 48:48.760
Drunks walk in and out of these parties
all the time.

48:50.302 --> 48:52.680
Explain it to him.

48:53.973 --> 48:55.566
Would you take
a look at this, please?

48:55.641 --> 48:58.645
We're monitoring the GPS chip
in Baptiste's phone.

48:58.727 --> 49:01.697
As long as he has it with him,
we can track him.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.239
Extraction could be difficult.

49:11.240 --> 49:14.710
Rescue operations have
a marginal rate of success.

49:15.494 --> 49:20.341
The most important thing
is that we eliminate the kidnappers.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.882
Everything else is secondary.

49:27.298 --> 49:30.302
Including Mr Baptiste.

49:33.429 --> 49:35.397
Is that clear?

49:45.608 --> 49:49.488
Just let me handle the questioning,
okay? It's what I do for a living.

49:49.570 --> 49:51.572
There's got to be a method to it, you know?

49:51.655 --> 49:54.454
It's psychology,
you get him to lower his guard.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.285
One sentence at a time, build a rhythm.

49:56.368 --> 49:57.585
It's a lot like music.

49:57.661 --> 50:01.006
Break his fucking legs,
he'll give you a Who concert.

50:01.081 --> 50:02.924
Just let me handle it, okay?

50:20.935 --> 50:23.438
That's got to be very uncomfortable.
Here we go.

50:25.898 --> 50:28.617
Feel better? That's good.

50:29.318 --> 50:33.539
Now, you know,
you're gonna talk to us, right?

50:33.614 --> 50:35.537
That's a given.

50:35.616 --> 50:37.835
And my associate here, he's a detective.

50:37.910 --> 50:41.665
And he's gonna ask you some questions
and you're gonna answer him.

50:41.747 --> 50:44.125
Remember one thing, though.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.461
If you don't answer to him,

50:46.544 --> 50:50.344
you sure as hell are gonna talk to me.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.390
Believe it. You're on.

50:58.847 --> 51:01.350
- Nice party.
- Thanks.

51:01.433 --> 51:04.437
I don't remember sending you an invitation,
but I'm glad you enjoyed it.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.522
Oh, I did! Great costumes.

51:08.107 --> 51:11.361
Especially the ladies
in their birthday suits, eh?

51:11.443 --> 51:13.036
Don't worry about it.

51:13.112 --> 51:16.582
I make sure they're all well-paid
and well taken care of.

51:17.324 --> 51:19.247
I bet you do.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.165
Don't condescend to me, Kato.

51:27.293 --> 51:29.762
- It says here you're a Chicago lawyer.
- That's right.

51:29.837 --> 51:33.933
Came here 15 years ago,
passed the Louisiana Bar.

51:34.008 --> 51:37.353
Specialised in real estate transactions.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.098
Mr Hot Property, huh?

51:40.180 --> 51:41.432
Thank God for Google.

51:42.516 --> 51:45.611
Well, how does it feel knowing
that you're going to get disbarred?

51:46.687 --> 51:52.535
Disgraced in the press, serve hard time,
lose every penny you've ever made.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.811
How long have you been doing business
with Ronnie Earl?

51:55.112 --> 51:56.204
Never heard of him.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.453
No, of course you have.

51:58.532 --> 52:02.036
Come on, he hired two hit men
who then murdered Hank Greely.

52:03.787 --> 52:05.539
Ronnie Earl said that you did the hiring.

52:05.623 --> 52:07.717
Yeah, that you paid the money.

52:07.791 --> 52:11.762
You're a crook, Mr Baptiste.
You're an accomplice to murder.

52:11.837 --> 52:14.465
Could we just end the charade? Huh?

52:14.715 --> 52:16.388
I know exactly who you two are.

52:16.842 --> 52:19.516
This is where I live, this is now my city.

52:19.595 --> 52:21.518
I am very highly connected.

52:21.597 --> 52:23.770
You're dealing with people
that are way up the ladder.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.650
You'll never make any of this bullshit stick.

52:26.101 --> 52:27.398
You want my advice?

52:27.478 --> 52:29.901
You let me go and then run to the airport

52:29.980 --> 52:32.074
as fast as you and this dumbbell
can get there.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.242
All right, that's it, okay.

52:34.318 --> 52:37.572
Hey, look, there's nothing you can do to me
I haven't already done to myself for fun.

52:37.655 --> 52:38.998
All right?

52:39.782 --> 52:41.659
How you doing, tough guy?

52:41.742 --> 52:43.494
You think he's comfortable?

52:44.870 --> 52:46.872
Ow! Fuck!

52:47.373 --> 52:49.296
Okay, wait, wait, what do you want?

52:49.375 --> 52:50.627
The tall guy that killed Louis.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.258
- Tall guy. Yeah, it's Keegan.
- Yeah? What's his deal?

52:53.337 --> 52:57.934
He's FFL.
Ex-mercenary, Central Africa, West Lebanon.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.511
Now, he contracts out
to Robert Nkomo Morel.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.221
Why'd you set me and Louis up?

53:02.304 --> 53:06.150
Morel didn't wanna take any chance that
Greely's death could be traced back to us.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.273
Greely was investigating Morel in DC.

53:08.352 --> 53:11.322
Evidence of his payoffs
to congressmen, senators, judges.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.774
Thought he could blackmail Morel.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.858
Didn't realise who he was fucking with.
That's it!

53:15.275 --> 53:18.449
No more!
Hell, I don't want to get myself killed here.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.906
I'm gonna blow your leg off.

53:19.988 --> 53:22.366
Okay, I'll tell you about Morel.

53:22.449 --> 53:25.168
He swindled a ton of money
out of West Africa.

53:25.619 --> 53:28.498
He started out buying up
a lot of cheap real estate here in the city

53:28.580 --> 53:29.661
using other people's names.

53:29.707 --> 53:32.085
Then he bribed his way into some
big government contract

53:32.167 --> 53:33.384
to redevelop the area.

53:33.794 --> 53:36.422
Look, I mean, this city is up for grabs,
always has been.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.132
We're just taking our share! That's it!

53:38.882 --> 53:41.010
This goes way up, man,
we're talking about Washington.

53:41.093 --> 53:42.766
You two are insane if you think that...

53:43.512 --> 53:46.061
Okay! Okay, okay, okay, okay, look.

53:46.140 --> 53:48.359
It's around my neck,
I copied Greely's whole life.

53:48.851 --> 53:50.694
Names, dates, accounts,

53:50.769 --> 53:52.769
a little insurance policy
in case Morel got clever.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.296
- Fuck!
- It's a flash drive.

53:57.317 --> 54:00.412
Look, you stupid motherfuckers
aren't gonna get away with this.

54:00.487 --> 54:01.808
Keegan's gonna punch your ticket,

54:01.822 --> 54:04.200
and I am gonna be there
and I am gonna watch.

54:04.324 --> 54:09.501
I'm gonna have a front row fucking seat.
You stupid and sloppy son of a bitch!

54:12.458 --> 54:13.960
Are you fucking insane?

54:14.042 --> 54:17.091
- You don't just kill a guy like that!
- I just did.

54:17.796 --> 54:21.050
I'm playing by the rules. Where you live,
the rules are different. All right?

54:21.133 --> 54:24.979
He set me up, had my friend killed,
took his chances and paid the price.

54:25.053 --> 54:27.852
By the way, I know guys
that would've done him real slow.

54:28.182 --> 54:32.028
- When this is over...
- Oh. You wanna do this dance?

54:32.102 --> 54:34.303
- I won't have a have a choice, will I?
- No, you won't.

55:02.716 --> 55:03.888
Hold!

55:03.967 --> 55:05.469
Hold your fire!

55:07.930 --> 55:09.898
Come on.

55:21.944 --> 55:23.070
Check right!

55:23.153 --> 55:25.497
- Check your six!
- I got a body!

55:39.670 --> 55:41.263
Bomb! Get the fuck out!

56:05.487 --> 56:07.034
A souvenir.

56:30.554 --> 56:34.479
You're probably wondering why I happen
to have my safe house all wired up.

56:37.394 --> 56:40.944
Not really. Like most criminals,
you have a paranoid personality.

57:06.006 --> 57:09.055
Here, take the keys and be quiet.
She's probably sleeping.

57:45.128 --> 57:46.129
Oh!

57:47.506 --> 57:48.598
What are you doing here?

57:48.674 --> 57:51.223
Look, I'm sorry, you must have not heard us.

57:51.301 --> 57:53.599
We were trying to be quiet,
so we didn't wake you up.

57:53.679 --> 57:56.649
I've been up all night.
I was just getting ready to go to bed.

57:58.558 --> 58:00.105
Do you mind if I use your computer?

58:00.185 --> 58:02.028
Oh, that's cute.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.001
Anything interesting?

58:24.084 --> 58:26.337
It's a list of names and payouts.

58:29.798 --> 58:31.198
Oh, yeah, I recognise some of them.

58:32.259 --> 58:35.388
Uh, that guy's a judge.
Some of the others, local politicians.

58:39.766 --> 58:41.359
What's that folder?

58:41.435 --> 58:43.278
Yeah, go up.

58:46.398 --> 58:48.617
Those are money transfers.

58:50.277 --> 58:53.827
Hey, we gotta find this guy,
Robert Nkomo Morel.

58:53.905 --> 58:54.952
Shouldn't be too hard.

58:55.032 --> 58:56.833
Yeah, figure out where the asshole is.

58:57.325 --> 58:58.577
We keep moving up the ladder.

59:02.456 --> 59:05.960
So, I was thinking that, you know,
what you got going is interesting

59:06.043 --> 59:07.920
because I have always liked tattoos.

59:08.003 --> 59:10.803
- And I think it's fascinating 'cause it's...
- It's just... It's real.

59:14.468 --> 59:15.560
<i>Homicide, Lebreton.</i>

59:15.635 --> 59:17.012
Lieutenant, it's Detective Taylor Kwon.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.769
Detective Kwon, how nice of you
to find the time to check in.

59:19.848 --> 59:22.852
Look, I think I broke
this whole thing wide open.

59:22.934 --> 59:25.232
There's this guy, Robert Nkomo Morel.

59:25.312 --> 59:28.407
He was chased out of Africa one step
one step ahead of prosecution.

59:28.482 --> 59:31.702
I got this flash drive
with a list of all the payouts.

59:31.777 --> 59:35.156
As soon as I get back into town,
you'll be the first person I call.

59:35.238 --> 59:37.411
- I told you I'd front you, didn't I?
- Nope.

59:37.491 --> 59:39.664
No. I don't want to have to owe you.

59:40.494 --> 59:41.711
You can make some real money.

59:41.787 --> 59:46.258
You got a gift, use it before it passes by.
I'm serious.

59:46.333 --> 59:48.335
Wow, that's great.

59:48.418 --> 59:52.514
That's really great.
You're giving me career advice.

59:55.217 --> 59:57.845
All right, forget it.
Bad or good, no good turn goes unpunished.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.561
Tell the cop I'll be outside, okay?

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.869
You know, about Jimmy,

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:19.791
you know I'll have to deal with him
at some point.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.243
You mean as a cop.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.209
Yeah, as a cop.

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:25.835
All right, look,
just cut him some slack, all right?

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:30.841
What if I told you he grew up on the streets,
and then prison.

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:33.638
It's the only life he had.

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:39.095
Look, you know, I'm sure
he's this brave as hell, very loyal...

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:41.145
But, you know,
we're judged based on our actions.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:44.812
He's done a lot of bad things.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:49.445
I better go.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:10.766
- What took you so long?
- I was saying goodbye to your daughter.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:11.964
Hmm.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.841
- Don't.
- Don't what?

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.423
- Just don't.
- Don't say goodbye, or...

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:20.936
Oh, don't go there.

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:23.351
Shit, it's none of my business.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:27.025
Most of the time,
she doesn't give a damn about me anyway.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.352
I mean, she's all right.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.636
Got a few issues, but what the hell,
who doesn't, right?

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.873
- You been married?
- No, never tried it.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:36.322
Yeah, me either.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.529
So who's Lisa's mother?

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.706
Hooker junkie. Dead 15 years.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:43.374
So, you raised her.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.794
No, I'm not a very good father,
but I supported her.

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:49.035
She turned out to be
a pretty good kid, considering.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.074
When we get ashore,
we gotta split up for a while.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.625
There's someone I gotta go meet.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.168
Who, you got a date?

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:31.085
It's a cop, he's from here.
I gotta go tell him what's going on.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:33.041
So, what about this other guy, Morel?

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:38.297
He'll hire an army of lawyers,
and fight the evidence on technical grounds.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.597
But he's still going down.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.153
Down. Is that what you call it? Down?

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:42.263
- Yeah, down.
- Down.

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:46.313
Six years at a country club jail,
out in two, back in business.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:47.560
That's not my idea of going down.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:50.358
Going down is what happened to Louis.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:54.029
All right, so you do what you gotta do,
I'll handle things my way.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.947
You know what, there is no your way!

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:58.741
Oh, here we go. So much for trusting a cop.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.286
- Yeah, you're under arrest.
- Am I really?

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:04.122
Okay, wanna do this dance again?

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.517
I tell you what,
unless you're willing to pull that trigger

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.002
and put a bullet to the head,

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:10.795
that nine mill ain't gonna be much help.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.622
Get out.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.425
It's my car.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.222
As soon as I take Morel down,
I'm coming back for you!

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:25.678
I'll be waiting, Confucius. I'll be waiting.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.014
Amateur.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.730
An amateur.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.831
I'd like to talk to you about Mr Keegan.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.962
I just talked to him.
I gave him some information I came up with.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.842
Turns out the guy that we're looking
for has a daughter. Only child.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.513
All the family he's got.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.933
Well, that sounds very promising.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:09.145
We'll let Mr Keegan mobilise,
as he would say.

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:11.940
But after things calm down,

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.814
I need Mr Keegan terminated.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:21.867
These psychotic paramilitaries he uses,
they have a huge respect for him.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:23.534
They see him as a hero.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.487
He's got that perverted sense of honour,

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.073
reckless sense of confrontation,
they love that.

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:32.498
Well, that's very impressive, Detective,
but I don't trust him.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:36.206
He does what he does for reasons
other than money.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:39.714
Sir, I'd think very hard
about this idea of termination.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:41.136
He's a unique asset.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:46.725
Never trust anyone who doesn't care
enough about money.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.975
You see,
Mr Keegan fancies himself as a hero.

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:52.472
Well, guess what?

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:57.444
In classical literature, the hero dies.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.789
Hey, how's it going? Just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:17.251
I need to talk to you. Outside, please.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.128
I can hear you fine in here.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:20.671
Nothing's easy.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.377
No!

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.522
No!

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.453
All right. Come here.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:32.831
- You got here fast.
- Not much traffic.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.328
Let's hear it.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:37.502
Greely and Blanchard are victims
of the same group.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:38.898
The guy in charge is named Morel.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.878
Greely found out about this in DC
and came down here to blackmail him.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:44.584
Yeah, I know the rest.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.385
I told you to go home.

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:57.313
I know, I've heard the speech.
We should have taken him in.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.948
You know, that still doesn't change anything.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.155
You're welcome.

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.081
So, Why'd you follow me?

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:18.035
I figured Morel had a few more cops
in his pocket.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.839
He was setting me up the whole time.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.177
First they take out Greely,
and then you and Louis.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:29.453
He was there to make sure
my investigation went nowhere.

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:37.641
Yeah.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.439
<i>Hello, Jimbo.
You sound like you're having a nice day.</i>

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:43.351
- Who's this?
<i>- You lost your partner last time we met.</i>

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:46.278
You and me,
we've got a few things we need to work out.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:48.652
<i>Hey, hold on a second.
Someone wants to say hi.</i>

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.030
- Speak.
- Jimmy.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.418
- They hurt you?
- No, not yet.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.829
You got a good-looking girl.
I got a few ideas what I'd like to do with her.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:08.127
Touch her and I'll kill you
with a fucking rock!

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:09.677
- Come here.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.930
This is simple.
We think you have something we want.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.223
A flash drive.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:15.596
Looks like I have something you want.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:16.767
Okay.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:21.221
Don't hurt her. Where you at? Where are you?

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:24.276
Market Street Power Plant.
And don't come heavy.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.399
If I see a piece,
your daughter is gonna go right off the roof.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:33.951
So what are we gonna do?

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.746
I want to get her back.
Give them what they want, then they die!

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.817
You shouldn't be here.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.569
Oh, I think otherwise, Mr Keegan.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:16.069
But don't worry about me.
Just worry about them.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.044
Check him. Make sure he's clean.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.216
He's here. He just rolled up.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.929
Jimmy Bobo's in the building.

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:47.977
Okay, Bobo. Up the stairs, third floor.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:53.564
Hey!

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:27.811
Hey!

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.235
- Make a left.
- Fucking cave bear.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.162
I'm gonna kill you.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.493
Gentlemen.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:51.168
No bickering, please.
We're here to do business.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.588
I assume you brought what I want?

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.294
Yeah. Where's my kid?

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.798
And where is your friend, the police officer?

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.509
Who gives a shit where he is?
That's your problem.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:06.517
But you let me go and pay my fee,
I'll hunt his ass down. Fact.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:09.390
Pay you a fee?

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:11.938
I don't believe I understand.

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:15.571
Understand what?
It's 500 grand, he's history.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.444
And with that amount,
you would sell your partner out? Like that?

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.366
He ain't my partner. He's a fucking cop.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:28.956
Half a million seems a bit much,
considering your circumstances.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.663
Your bargaining position is very weak.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.131
250.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.300
Done.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.842
Where's my daughter?

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:44.768
She's in the building, don't worry.
She's currently unharmed.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:46.936
I wanna see Lisa.
You got a problem with that?

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:49.013
Are you guys fucking with me, or what?

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:50.814
No problem whatsoever.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.110
Bring her in.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.359
Wait a second. Hey.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:59.365
You don't have to do this.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.741
When I want your opinion,
I'll buy you a brain.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.275
Hey, let go of her!
Hey! Get your hands off of her!

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.947
Let go of her!

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:44.235
You hit her?

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.112
How about that.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:47.617
I think she liked it.

01:12:58.249 --> 01:12:59.717
Now, my friend.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.339
The flash drive, please.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.641
Thank you.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.438
Very good.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:23.024
We're back in business.

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:24.817
You can let her go.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:28.912
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:32.162
I'd like this thing with the police officer
done quickly.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:33.834
Don't make me wait.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.708
Let's get out of here.

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.384
Where's Taylor?

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.136
He's all right.

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:58.272
Now, Detective Towne,

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.446
I want you to make sure that
Mr Bobo and his daughter

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.898
are safely escorted out of the building.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:05.028
Yes, sir.

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:08.111
You don't seem to be very happy, Mr Keegan.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:11.448
You're treating this Jimmy Bobo
way too good. Maybe you forgot.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.534
Four of our operatives got killed
by this guy last night.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:16.248
You care about them?

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:19.793
Well, they're mercenaries like you.
They take their chances.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.715
250 is as much as you paid me.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:25.091
Well, Mr Bobo had leverage.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.718
You don't.

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:33.348
I've got plenty of leverage.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:34.978
Mr Towne.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.273
All right.
Look, you don't have an argument with me!

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.981
This is my world! Son of a bitch!

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:47.692
I'll kill you! How dare you?

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:53.327
I always knew never to trust a man
who doesn't care about money!

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:15.102
Drop your weapon.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.233
- Get in there. Get in!
- What?

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.863
Just get in there and stay down!

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:14.070
Stay down and sit back.

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:19.708
There he is! Take him out!

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.085
Bitch!

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.614
Ready for another round?

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.202
I said I was gonna kill you.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.249
Yeah.

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:48.877
It's kind of fun, isn't it?

01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:51.459
Just you and me, two professionals.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.045
Only one gets away.

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:00.509
Come on.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.643
Look at that.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:08.351
"Dedicated to the good men
who battled the fire

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:10.653
that took so many lives
in the year of our Lord,

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.025
1910."

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.072
Morel was gonna burn this place down

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:16.947
and build a fucking shopping centre
or some bullshit.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.370
And all the poor bastards
that saved this place,

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:21.368
nobody's gonna remember who they were.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.666
Nobody's gonna even remember
what they saved.

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:26.828
Are we gonna fight,
or you plan on boring me to death?

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:39.423
Come here, Jimmy.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.014
What are we, fucking Vikings?

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:43.936
Pick it up.

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.485
There you go.

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:54.818
Pick it up!

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.392
I'm impressed.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:38.899
Ohh.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.365
Oh! Oh.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.320
Ouch. You okay?

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:49.891
Fuck!

01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.195
Fuck!

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:34.181
I had it under control.

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:35.766
Yeah, bullshit.

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:37.476
You were history.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.487
Call it even.

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:52.256
Keegan went rogue upstairs
and killed Morel and the rest of them.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.503
We still gotta sort out you and me,

01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:58.126
by the law.

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:02.171
The law.

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:07.010
You know, when it gets down to it,
you're still just another chicken-shit cop.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:13.686
Let's sort you out.

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.931
- No! No!

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.069
Come here.

01:22:21.812 --> 01:22:23.155
You son of a bitch!

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.527
I know, I know.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.571
Listen up.

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:35.376
Keegan shot the guys upstairs.
Tell them I shot the rest.

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.375
You tried to stop me, and I shot you, too.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.706
Make that your story.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.210
Yeah, you're welcome.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:52.309
Lisa, you coming,
or you want to meet some more cops?

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:55.391
I'm gonna stay with him.

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:57.514
Right.

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:00.312
I'll be in touch.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.273
Try not to move.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.178
I don't like cops.

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:30.551
You can't trust them.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:32.008
Let me put it this way.

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:35.811
You can only trust them to be
what they really are.

01:23:35.886 --> 01:23:38.014
But this guy, Kwon,

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:42.272
when he turned in his report, guess what?

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.695
He didn't rat me out.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:49.697
When the news broke, the story was
the bad guys got greedy, killed each other.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:52.779
So I knew I must have stayed clean.

01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:57.203
I don't know.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:24:00.627
I guess Kwon figured he owed me.

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:05.458
Six weeks later, he sent me a message
about maybe having a drink.

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:22.892
I thought I smelled a cop.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.610
Guess who's late.

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:29.865
I read about you in the paper.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.318
Looks like you're quite the hero.

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:35.070
Glad everything's working out okay for you.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:38.327
Except for the two holes in my shoulder,
two weeks in the hospital,

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.330
and a month of rehab.

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.671
I'll be sure to repay the favour some day.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.378
So that's what you came down here
to tell me?

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:50.006
Actually, I came down to tell you
a couple things.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.382
All right, shoot.

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:54.177
First, I decided to get a tattoo.

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:57.134
Really?

01:24:57.217 --> 01:25:00.346
Yeah. Lisa came down to the hospital
to visit me a lot.

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.519
At the hospital?

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:04.725
We got to know each other.

01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:05.976
Mmm.

01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:08.608
Actually, we got to really know each other.

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:13.067
Really know each other. That's nice.

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:15.524
You know, I gotta be going.

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:16.946
Here's your fortune cookie.

01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:21.124
I'm not gonna come after you for anything
you did in the past.

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:24.624
But you break the law again
and I hear about it,

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:26.546
Oh, you're going down.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.132
That'll be the day.

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.678
Drinks on my buddy here.

01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:38.600
Oh, shit. That hurt?

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.823
So that's the way it went down.

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:57.904
Nothing much changed except some people
got killed that nobody's ever gonna miss.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.663
And I ended up needing a new car,

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:03.709
so I went out
and bought myself a special ride.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.796
Why not? You don't live forever.
