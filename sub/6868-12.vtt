WEBVTT

00:01.911 --> 00:05.413
KELLOGG: Mayday mayday mayday,
this is Commander Kellogg of

00:05.415 --> 00:08.248
I.S.A. Space Station Horizon, [garbled]

00:08.250 --> 00:10.282
secure transmission [garbled]

00:10.284 --> 00:11.283
Commander Drake.

00:11.285 --> 00:15.352
Tony, the crew has [garbled],
and we are under [garbled].

00:15.354 --> 00:18.857
I say again, we are under [garbled].

00:18.859 --> 00:23.328
Croatoooooan!

00:23.330 --> 00:26.230
DRAKE: And that, Mrs. Archer...
MALORY: Ms.

00:26.232 --> 00:26.698
ARCHER: Don't.

00:26.700 --> 00:30.136
DRAKE: Ahh -- Ms. Archer, I beg your pardon --
ARCHER: Don't.

00:30.138 --> 00:33.039
DRAKE: -- that was the last
transmission from the Horizon.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.008
ARCHER: Which, obviously pretty vague.

00:35.010 --> 00:35.947
DRAKE: Vague?!

00:36.067 --> 00:38.979
You heard Commander Kellogg, he
said the Horizon is under attack!

00:38.981 --> 00:42.548
LANA: Well, under something...
ARCHER: He could've been saying underfinanced.

00:42.550 --> 00:43.082
DRAKE: What?

00:43.084 --> 00:45.652
MALORY: Sterling -- ARCHER: What, they're
always whining about needing more

00:45.654 --> 00:47.621
money for their boondocks.

00:47.623 --> 00:48.388
LANA: Doggles.

00:48.390 --> 00:48.922
ARCHER: What?

00:48.924 --> 00:51.758
DRAKE: You think space
exploration is a boondoggle?!

00:51.760 --> 00:53.627
LANA: Well c'mon, in this economy?

00:53.629 --> 00:54.761
DRAKE: Exactly!

00:54.763 --> 00:58.264
Now, more than ever, is when
we need to look to space

00:58.266 --> 01:01.500
for the solutions to
mankind's problems.

01:01.502 --> 01:04.504
In just two hundred years,
Earth's population will exceed

01:04.506 --> 01:06.672
her capacity to produce enough food.

01:06.674 --> 01:10.709
And even as the famines begin,
global war will erupt as fresh

01:10.711 --> 01:13.345
water becomes scarcer than gold.

01:13.347 --> 01:18.616
But if we begin now, using the lessons
learned aboard Space Station Horizon,

01:18.618 --> 01:22.688
a small group of brave
colonists, can terraform Mars.

01:22.690 --> 01:26.292
And mankind can finally slip
the surly bonds of Earth,

01:26.294 --> 01:30.496
to live forever among the stars!

01:30.498 --> 01:31.563
ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.

01:31.565 --> 01:32.130
LANA: Wh-?

01:32.132 --> 01:33.832
ARCHER: Jesus, read a
book once in your life.

01:33.834 --> 01:36.267
So where does ISIS fit in, Commander?

01:36.269 --> 01:38.736
DRAKE: Well -- MALORY: Well I think
that's a bit premature, until we discuss

01:38.738 --> 01:40.272
our fee structure.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.907
DRAKE: As to that, you
can name your price.

01:42.909 --> 01:45.510
LANA: Oh now they've got --
MALORY: Enough!

01:45.512 --> 01:48.213
Commander? As to our role?

01:48.215 --> 01:50.382
DRAKE: Horizon has an
international crew.

01:50.384 --> 01:54.854
American, German, Chinese, French--
ARCHER: Ba-dum-bump!

01:54.856 --> 01:56.856
Sorry, I thought "French"

01:56.858 --> 02:00.059
was a joke DRAKE: Is mutiny
funny to you, Mr. Archer?

02:00.061 --> 02:03.897
ARCHER: I dunno, maybe a mutiny of clowns...
DRAKE: Because I fear that one

02:03.899 --> 02:06.566
faction, led by radical
nationalists, has mutinied.

02:06.568 --> 02:07.300
LANA: But who?

02:07.302 --> 02:07.835
Which one?

02:07.837 --> 02:10.336
DRAKE: Well if I --
ARCHER: If he knew, he would tell us!

02:10.339 --> 02:10.971
MALORY: Read a book!

02:10.973 --> 02:14.141
DRAKE: And since I don't know which
faction is behind the mutiny --

02:14.143 --> 02:17.678
LANA: If there even was one...
DRAKE: -- I can't trust anyone at the I.S.A.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.579
Which is why I came to ISIS.

02:19.581 --> 02:21.347
MALORY: Because of our loyalty.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.748
DRAKE: Or lack thereof.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.049
MALORY: Or whatever.

02:24.051 --> 02:26.552
DRAKE: Because I need a small
cadre of highly trained agents

02:26.554 --> 02:29.655
to fly into orbit and help me
to retake control of Horizon.

02:29.657 --> 02:30.522
LANA: Nooope!

02:30.524 --> 02:31.457
ARCHER: Yeahhhp!

02:31.459 --> 02:32.090
LANA: Archer!

02:32.092 --> 02:32.691
ARCHER: Lana!

02:32.693 --> 02:33.959
LANA: He just said "highly-trained"!

02:33.961 --> 02:37.762
And last time I checked, none of us were
even lowly-trained to be astronauts!

02:37.764 --> 02:39.330
ARCHER: Well how hard could it be?

02:39.332 --> 02:40.164
DRAKE: Incredibly.

02:40.166 --> 02:43.835
MALORY: But since apparently money is no object...
DRAKE: The training schedule

02:43.837 --> 02:46.305
will have to be highly compressed,
because the shuttle Intrepid is

02:46.307 --> 02:47.973
launching in three days.

02:47.975 --> 02:50.709
And I won't lie to you, this
mission will be dangerous.

02:50.711 --> 02:54.646
ARCHER: Would you say we'll be
venturing into a zone of danger?

02:54.648 --> 02:56.315
DRAKE: Well yes, obviously.

02:56.317 --> 02:58.517
ARCHER: No, but -- how
would you phrase that?

02:58.519 --> 03:01.435
DRAKE: I -- the zone
will be one of danger?

03:01.555 --> 03:06.002
ARCHER: No, I mean say --
oh forget it, never mind.

03:06.122 --> 03:08.027
And you never mind and also shut up.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.301
ARCHER: Oww!

03:45.421 --> 03:47.270
Jesus Krieger, that's the bone!

03:47.390 --> 03:51.926
KRIEGER: Oh, da mean doctor take widdle
baby's bwud, and widdle baby goes --

03:51.928 --> 03:52.393
owww!

03:52.395 --> 03:53.994
ARCHER: You're a baby.

03:53.996 --> 03:55.929
And astronaut training
sucks complete ass!

03:55.931 --> 03:56.430
Literally!

03:56.432 --> 03:58.432
What is the deal with all the enemas?!

03:58.434 --> 04:01.269
KRIEGER: Uh --
ARCHER: And why do you need so much blood?!

04:01.271 --> 04:03.637
And wait, now that I think about it --
DRAKE: Why is this man in

04:03.639 --> 04:04.872
the restricted area?!

04:04.874 --> 04:06.507
KRIEGER: Who, him?

04:06.509 --> 04:07.408
DRAKE: You.

04:07.410 --> 04:08.609
ARCHER: Wh-? Krieger!

04:08.611 --> 04:10.978
KRIEGER: Uh -- smoke bomb!

04:10.980 --> 04:13.013
DRAKE: And why aren't you
with the other trainees?

04:13.015 --> 04:16.183
ARCHER: I was told I had to
undergo a bunch of extremely

04:16.185 --> 04:17.584
invasive medical tests.

04:17.586 --> 04:20.987
DRAKE: Well normally you
would, but by our doctors.

04:20.988 --> 04:23.589
But since you're on such an
accelerated training schedule --

04:23.591 --> 04:26.525
ARCHER: Six enemas is a luxury
we can ill afford, got it.

04:26.527 --> 04:27.393
MALORY: Six?!

04:27.395 --> 04:29.562
ARCHER: Or -- who knows,
he put me under.

04:29.564 --> 04:30.029
Maybe twelve.

04:30.031 --> 04:33.500
DRAKE: Now you've wasted half a day,
so the other trainees are way

04:33.502 --> 04:33.867
ahead of you.

04:33.869 --> 04:36.937
ARCHER: Not for long they're not!

04:36.939 --> 04:38.472
[loud crash]

04:38.474 --> 04:40.508
DRAKE: Well he's eager,
I'll give him that.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.410
MALORY: Well, you inspire him.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.414
With all those medals
on that powerful chest.

04:45.416 --> 04:49.051
Your wife is a very lucky--
DRAKE: I'm a widower.

04:49.053 --> 04:50.018
MALORY: Oh!

04:50.020 --> 04:52.588
Difficult to meet people,
isn't it, in jobs like ours.

04:52.590 --> 04:58.064
I only mention it because I also happen
to be single -- DRAKE: Yes, I know.

04:58.184 --> 05:01.310
Excuse me.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.674
MALORY: I hope to God that was alcohol.

05:10.676 --> 05:11.475
LANA: No!

05:11.477 --> 05:11.875
ARCHER: Yes!

05:11.877 --> 05:13.944
LANA: Dammit Archer, it's--
ARCHER: It's my turn!

05:13.946 --> 05:15.512
Cyril! Cyril!

05:15.514 --> 05:17.047
Drake said lemme fly it!

05:17.049 --> 05:19.016
CYRIL: Cut it out, Archer!

05:19.018 --> 05:20.418
I'm landing!

05:20.420 --> 05:24.722
C'mon, baby, keep that nose up...
[SMASH]

05:24.724 --> 05:25.857
CYRIL: What the --?!

05:25.859 --> 05:26.591
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:

05:26.593 --> 05:27.625
Explosive decompression.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.826
Explosive decompression.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.727
ARCHER: Happy, Cyril?!

05:29.729 --> 05:31.963
You just destroyed Alderaan!

05:31.965 --> 05:35.332
LANA: Dammit, that was closer than any
of us have gotten to actually landing!

05:35.334 --> 05:40.169
ARCHER: A, because you're all crap, and
B, who cares, we're not gonna land it!

05:40.171 --> 05:42.438
CYRIL: What the hell --
DRAKE: -- is going on in here?!

05:42.440 --> 05:45.474
LANA: Archer --
ARCHER: Saw an electrical fire in the simulator,

05:45.476 --> 05:48.277
and knowing that my colleague's
life was in danger, I --

05:48.279 --> 05:50.279
DRAKE: You acted without thinking!

05:50.281 --> 05:50.913
LANA: As always.

05:50.915 --> 05:54.785
ARCHER: Not always...
DRAKE: Well, thank God you did -- LANA: Wh-?

05:54.787 --> 05:55.552
ARCHER: But almost always!

05:55.554 --> 05:58.322
DRAKE: -- because that's exactly
the kind of decisive action

05:58.324 --> 05:59.723
this mission calls for.

05:59.725 --> 06:01.760
You could all learn something from him.

06:01.762 --> 06:05.163
EVERYBODY: Oh my God...
DRAKE: Starting with a little training exercise we

06:05.165 --> 06:11.102
lightheartedly call... The Vomit Comet!

06:11.104 --> 06:14.706
And if you're wondering why we call it that...
LANA: [huge retch]

06:14.708 --> 06:15.340
GILLETTE: Gagh!

06:15.342 --> 06:16.441
Aw, it's all in my hair!

06:16.443 --> 06:18.910
CYRIL: Oh Jeezy H. Petes!

06:18.912 --> 06:20.744
ARCHER: What the hell is
wrong with you, Lana?!

06:20.746 --> 06:22.346
DRAKE:... that's why we call it that.

06:22.348 --> 06:27.017
LANA: What possible reason, could there
be, to subject human beings to --

06:27.019 --> 06:33.057
SKEWWWWWWW...
ARCHER: Such mind-shattering awesomeness!

06:33.059 --> 06:39.363
DRAKE: The KC-135 flies in a parabolic arc--
ARCHER: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo caaaaaaaaaares!

06:39.365 --> 06:43.368
DRAKE: -- which allows us to achieve
weightlessness for about thirty seconds.

06:43.370 --> 06:47.706
We'll do this twenty times --
ARCHER: Woooooo! Weightlessness!

06:47.708 --> 06:50.975
DRAKE: -- so you can get acquainted
with the sensation of being weightless.

06:50.977 --> 06:54.645
It takes some time getting used to, but --
CYRIL: Ow.

06:54.647 --> 06:55.913
DRAKE: Agent Kane.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.981
Are you alright?

06:56.983 --> 06:57.681
LANA: Yep.

06:57.683 --> 06:58.649
Yep yep yep.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.617
GILLETTE: What is going on with you?

07:00.619 --> 07:01.452
LANA: Do not like.

07:01.454 --> 07:02.519
GILLETTE: What're you, crazy?

07:02.521 --> 07:04.521
What's not to --
LANA: [huge retch]

07:04.523 --> 07:05.255
GILLETTE: Oh.

07:05.257 --> 07:07.090
CYRIL: No! Archer, noooo!

07:07.092 --> 07:07.724
ARCHER: Yeesss!

07:07.726 --> 07:10.193
CYRIL: Please don't do this!

07:10.195 --> 07:12.529
ARCHER: What's that?
Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the

07:12.531 --> 07:17.768
sound of the vawshiiiit!

07:17.770 --> 07:18.802
DRAKE: Looking good!

07:18.804 --> 07:21.805
Only nineteen more to go!

07:21.807 --> 07:26.075
LANA: Nineteen more times...
Until there was literally

07:26.077 --> 07:28.512
no more fluid left in my body.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.447
CYRIL: Yeah, and thanks
so much for that.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.850
LANA: Cyril...
ARCHER: She's not the one who kept riding you into it

07:32.852 --> 07:34.218
holding your mouth open.

07:34.220 --> 07:38.423
CYRIL: Jeez, even in zero gravity you're
an assho -- ARCHER: You were saying?

07:38.425 --> 07:41.159
To the wet-towel wielding
survivor of fifteen years of

07:41.161 --> 07:43.095
boarding school locker rooms?

07:43.097 --> 07:44.162
LANA: Wait, fifteen?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.998
ARCHER: Or -- whatever,
the normal number.

07:46.000 --> 07:46.932
LANA: Twelve?!

07:46.934 --> 07:48.700
DRAKE: Yes, we will
launch in twelve hours.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.269
We received another
transmission from the Horizon.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.137
They can't wait.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.805
LANA: But we haven't
been trained properly!

07:53.807 --> 07:55.473
ARCHER: To what, wear a seat belt?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.375
Actually, is it a
five-point harness, or...?

07:57.377 --> 08:00.744
DRAKE: I admit this isn't an ideal scenario --
LANA: Speaking of,

08:00.746 --> 08:03.246
what's the scenario when
we get to the Horizon?

08:03.248 --> 08:06.716
We don't have a tactical plan, we don't--
DRAKE: We'll have plenty of time

08:06.718 --> 08:07.840
to discuss our plan of
action during the flight.

08:07.960 --> 08:08.734
LANA: But --
MALORY: Lana!

08:08.854 --> 08:10.286
What has gotten in to you?

08:10.288 --> 08:13.890
CYRIL: More like what got out of her...
GILLETTE: Sir, I'm not sure Lana-

08:13.892 --> 08:16.826
sorry honey - is physically
capable of spaceflight.

08:16.828 --> 08:18.161
LANA: Ray!

08:18.163 --> 08:19.763
Actually I may not be cut out for it.

08:19.765 --> 08:25.088
DRAKE: I'm sorry to hear that, Agent Kane...
Because you're going.

08:30.644 --> 08:37.089
ARCHER: [chuckling] To a zone,
which is one of danger.

08:42.351 --> 08:44.452
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:
T-minus ninety seconds.

08:44.735 --> 08:47.202
DRAKE: Roger, Control,
all systems are go.

08:47.204 --> 08:49.003
Next stop, Horizon.

08:49.369 --> 08:50.701
Okay. Archer.

08:50.703 --> 08:52.970
ARCHER: Sorry, are you talking to me?

08:52.972 --> 08:55.273
Or to her, who why is she here?!

08:55.275 --> 08:56.941
MALORY: Because Tony invited me!

08:56.943 --> 08:57.809
ARCHER: Tony?!

08:57.811 --> 09:01.079
What, you trying to get my mother
into the Million-Mile High Club?!

09:01.081 --> 09:01.913
MALORY: Sterling!

09:01.915 --> 09:03.982
DRAKE: Archer...
GILLETTE: Would you calm the hell down?!

09:03.984 --> 09:04.782
ARCHER: I am calm!

09:04.784 --> 09:05.917
And I'm also outta here!

09:05.919 --> 09:07.985
DRAKE: Take your hands
off that harness.

09:07.987 --> 09:08.686
ARCHER: Make me!

09:08.688 --> 09:10.421
Oh, and just so you know?!

09:10.423 --> 09:13.090
She -- Can't breathe.

09:13.092 --> 09:15.325
MISSION CONTROL: Uh, Flight,
we're showing suit number two

09:15.327 --> 09:16.527
with an oh-two malfunction.

09:16.529 --> 09:19.362
DRAKE: Double-check that, Control,
I'm showing green across the board.

09:19.364 --> 09:20.697
MISSION CONTROL: Stand by.

09:20.699 --> 09:23.833
DRAKE: Roger, standing by.

09:23.835 --> 09:25.468
Doo do doooo...
MALORY: Tony, please!

09:25.470 --> 09:26.569
He'll behave!

09:26.571 --> 09:27.470
Won't he!

09:27.472 --> 09:28.737
ARCHER: Ip.

09:28.739 --> 09:33.709
DRAKE: Excellent... Because I won't-
I can't - let anyone jeopardize the

09:33.711 --> 09:35.078
success of this mission.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.248
MISSION CONTROL: Flight, oh-two
on suit two is showing normal.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.717
But uh, keep an eye on it.

09:39.719 --> 09:42.420
DRAKE: Oh, I will.

09:42.422 --> 09:44.455
ARCHER: Hooray...
DRAKE: Resume countdown, Control.

09:44.457 --> 09:45.590
MISSION CONTROL: Roger, Flight.

09:45.592 --> 09:48.927
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE: T-minus five... four...
DRAKE: Exciting, isn't it?

09:48.929 --> 09:50.695
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:
Three.

09:50.697 --> 09:51.329
Two.

09:51.331 --> 09:51.896
One.

09:51.898 --> 09:52.764
DRAKE: I think it is.

09:52.766 --> 09:53.731
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:

09:53.733 --> 09:55.132
Ignition.

09:55.134 --> 10:00.070
MISSION CONTROL: Liftoff.

10:00.072 --> 10:02.573
DRAKE: Just relax, and
rely on your training!

10:02.575 --> 10:04.508
LANA: Which we didn't have!

10:04.510 --> 10:06.610
DRAKE: Because Phase
Two's a little rough!

10:06.612 --> 10:07.678
ARCHER: Phase Two?!

10:07.680 --> 10:09.579
What's Phase -- [BOOOOM!]

10:09.581 --> 10:17.153
EVERYBODY: Aaaaaaghhhhh!

10:17.155 --> 10:18.955
DRAKE: That was Phase Two.

10:18.957 --> 10:20.557
LANA: Did not like.

10:20.559 --> 10:22.359
DRAKE: Wait'll you see Phase Three.

10:22.361 --> 10:24.228
EVERYBODY: What?

10:24.230 --> 10:26.598
DRAKE: I'm kidding, there
is no Phase Three.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.865
Just a little space-humor.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.534
ARCHER: Yeah, funny stuff.

10:29.536 --> 10:31.603
DRAKE: Right?

10:31.605 --> 10:34.806
Right, then... I want to brief you
all on we can expect when we dock

10:34.808 --> 10:36.007
with Horizon.

10:36.009 --> 10:38.443
LANA: Ugh, can we expect a pharmacy?

10:38.445 --> 10:40.178
ARCHER: Lana, it's not a strip mall.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.113
Although I assume there's a bar?

10:42.115 --> 10:42.781
DRAKE: A bar?

10:42.783 --> 10:44.716
ARCHER: Or whatever, cantina.

10:44.718 --> 10:45.884
DRAKE: Ah... No.

10:45.886 --> 10:47.786
Please pay attention.

10:47.788 --> 10:51.490
We'll dock here, move forward on foot
toward Horizon's bridge, and --

10:51.492 --> 10:52.591
CYRIL: Wait, on foot?

10:52.593 --> 10:55.360
DRAKE: Horizon has artificial gravity.

10:55.362 --> 10:58.030
See how it spins on its
longitudinal axis?

10:58.032 --> 11:00.332
ARCHER: Lana, look at it spin.

11:00.334 --> 11:03.636
DRAKE: When we reach the bridge,
we'll retake control of Horizon.

11:03.638 --> 11:07.706
But we can expect heavy resistance,
I'm sure the mutineers are armed.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.775
ARCHER: With what,
slide rules and Tang?

11:09.777 --> 11:14.313
DRAKE: The M-41 Mark Two plasma-pulse
rifle with concussion grenade launcher.

11:14.315 --> 11:15.648
EVERYBODY: Oh shit!

11:15.650 --> 11:19.719
DRAKE: On "kill" mode, the M-41
fires lethal plasma ammunition.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.255
On "stun" it fires an ion pulse.

11:22.257 --> 11:23.789
Similar to an EMP.

11:23.791 --> 11:25.992
ARCHER: And can it be
fired with an erection?

11:25.994 --> 11:26.392
MALORY: Ugh.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.860
LANA: Archer! Muzzle?!

11:27.862 --> 11:29.428
ARCHER: Relax, it's on stun Lana.

11:29.430 --> 11:30.263
DRAKE: Careful.

11:30.265 --> 11:35.635
Even on stun it can --
ARCHER: Oops.

11:35.637 --> 11:36.069
DRAKE: Clear!

11:36.071 --> 11:38.371
LANA: Clear! GILLETTE: Clear!

11:38.373 --> 11:40.974
CYRIL: Owwwwwww!

11:40.976 --> 11:45.445
DRAKE: Whew! As I was saying, it's possible
for the EMP to stop a man's heart.

11:45.447 --> 11:46.846
ARCHER: So "stun,"

11:46.848 --> 11:48.748
maybe a bit of a misnomer.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.618
CYRIL: Dammit, Archer...
ARCHER: I'm not the one who was all sweaty!

11:51.620 --> 11:55.255
DRAKE: Mr. Archer, that's twice you've
jeopardized the success of this mission!

11:55.257 --> 11:56.690
There will not be a third!

11:56.692 --> 11:59.726
MISSION CONTROL: Uh, Flight,
we have a problem...

11:59.728 --> 12:04.398
ARCHER: Well don't look at me...
DRAKE: My God, on this trajectory we'll miss

12:04.400 --> 12:05.299
Horizon!

12:05.301 --> 12:06.433
Control, what happened?!

12:06.435 --> 12:11.238
MISSION CONTROL: Burn rates were
good, Flight, uh... stand by.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.475
Uh, Flight, we're showing that
you are grossly overweight.

12:14.477 --> 12:15.643
PAM: Oh, for --!

12:15.645 --> 12:17.477
I wouldn't say grossly!

12:17.479 --> 12:18.745
CHERYL/CAROL: I would.

12:18.747 --> 12:23.550
DRAKE: I would be well within my rights
to jettison both of you into space!

12:23.552 --> 12:24.751
MALORY: Well within them!

12:24.753 --> 12:25.385
LANA: Malory!

12:25.387 --> 12:26.152
DRAKE: However!

12:26.154 --> 12:31.524
For uh, numerous reasons - one being
this ship can't actually do that -

12:31.526 --> 12:33.159
I've decided take you with us.

12:33.161 --> 12:34.294
EVERYBODY: [Sigh of relief]

12:34.296 --> 12:36.330
DRAKE: But I want to
know how you got aboard.

12:36.332 --> 12:38.065
PAM: Whaddya mean, how?

12:38.067 --> 12:43.405
Mr. Ar --
ARCHER: Yeah so that safety's tricky, huh?

12:43.407 --> 12:43.839
DRAKE: Clear!

12:43.841 --> 12:46.008
LANA: Clear! GILLETTE: Clear!

12:46.010 --> 12:48.544
PAM: Owwwwwww!

12:48.546 --> 12:53.649
CHERYL/CAROL: Awesome...
PAM: Son of a shitsnackin whore... DRAKE: Mr. Figgis!

12:53.651 --> 12:57.753
Lock that man in the cargo hold.

12:57.755 --> 12:58.554
ARCHER: Who, me?

12:58.556 --> 13:00.289
CYRIL: Aye freaking aye.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.557
DRAKE: Ms. Archer.

13:01.559 --> 13:04.226
MALORY: In case I need
to sterilize something?

13:04.228 --> 13:05.427
DRAKE: Get strapped in.

13:05.429 --> 13:08.062
Agent Gillette, monitor
this woman's vital signs.

13:08.064 --> 13:09.764
Agent Kane, come with me.

13:09.766 --> 13:12.333
I may need some help
getting us to Horizon.

13:12.335 --> 13:16.371
So that we don't die writhing in
agony when we run out of oxygen.

13:16.373 --> 13:18.841
ARCHER: Yeah, been there, no picnic.

13:18.843 --> 13:21.277
Speaking of, great for picnics.

13:21.279 --> 13:23.880
The tofu teriyaki, not so much.

13:23.882 --> 13:25.949
PAM: There's teriyaki?

13:25.951 --> 13:26.850
CYRIL: No!

13:26.852 --> 13:28.152
ARCHER: Cyril, c'mon, lemme out.

13:28.154 --> 13:28.786
CYRIL: No, you jerk!

13:28.788 --> 13:31.622
You shoot me in the heart with a
space-blaster... ARCHER: Wh-?!

13:31.624 --> 13:33.691
You're still mad about that?!

13:33.693 --> 13:37.995
CYRIL: Not to mention whatever idiot
reason you had for smuggling Pam on board!

13:37.997 --> 13:39.497
GILLETTE: You're screwin
him, aren'tcha?

13:39.499 --> 13:42.032
PAM: Whaaaaaaaat?

13:42.034 --> 13:42.633
Yes.

13:42.635 --> 13:43.467
CYRIL: No!

13:43.469 --> 13:46.704
Because if we don't die, for all
I care you can rot in there!

13:46.706 --> 13:49.106
ARCHER: Cyril?! Cyril!

13:49.108 --> 13:58.049
Well good luck fighting a bunch of
whatever, space-pirates without me.

13:58.051 --> 14:01.018
[BEEP] you, space.

14:06.399 --> 14:11.436
DRAKE: Come on baby,
just a few more seconds!

14:11.438 --> 14:13.271
Damn it!

14:13.801 --> 14:15.367
I don't know if that was
a long enough burn!

14:15.369 --> 14:18.504
Agent Kane, I need a readout!

14:18.506 --> 14:20.674
For God's sake, woman, Dramamine!

14:20.676 --> 14:23.510
LANA: It makes me sleepy...
CYRIL: I think we're okay, sir!

14:23.512 --> 14:24.845
DRAKE: Thank God.

14:24.847 --> 14:26.780
Because we're out of fuel.

14:26.782 --> 14:27.414
CHERYL/CAROL: What?!

14:27.416 --> 14:29.150
How are we gonna get back to Earth?!

14:29.152 --> 14:31.052
DRAKE: There is fuel.

14:31.054 --> 14:32.086
On Horizon.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.021
CHERYL/CAROL: Well I didn't know that.

14:34.023 --> 14:35.623
DRAKE: The flight computer
will dock the ship.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.991
Assemble the boarding party.

14:36.993 --> 14:39.194
CHERYL/CAROL: Nor was I told
there would be a party.

14:39.196 --> 14:40.295
Lana, what're you wearing?

14:40.297 --> 14:42.931
DRAKE: Bio-matrix composite body armor.

14:42.933 --> 14:44.500
Effective against small-arms fire.

14:44.502 --> 14:46.669
And we need all the help we can get.

14:46.671 --> 14:48.271
GILLETTE: Since there's
only four of us.

14:48.273 --> 14:50.840
CYRIL: Yeah, that seems kinda... few.

14:50.842 --> 14:52.875
PAM: Heck, if you need some help, I'll --
DRAKE: No!

14:52.877 --> 14:55.845
We can't jeopardize the women!

14:55.847 --> 14:56.745
LANA: Cough.

14:56.747 --> 14:58.613
MALORY: Well not you...
DRAKE: No, no, no, Agent Kane,

14:58.615 --> 15:02.950
I'm afraid your particular skill-set
outweighs your --

15:02.952 --> 15:05.052
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE: Docking complete.

15:05.054 --> 15:06.220
CHERYL/CAR: Is that a ghost?

15:06.222 --> 15:06.754
PAM: Nope.

15:06.756 --> 15:08.489
DRAKE: Boarding party,
into the airlock.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.256
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:

15:09.258 --> 15:10.725
Gravity engaged.

15:10.727 --> 15:13.728
DRAKE: Weapons on stun, fast
and hard to the bridge.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.630
And remember, these are mutineers.

15:15.632 --> 15:25.341
Even if they try to say --
CYRIL: Suppressing fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!

15:25.343 --> 15:26.909
DRAKE: Otherwise.

15:26.911 --> 15:27.710
Just follow me.

15:27.712 --> 15:30.513
LANA: And try not to
shoot me in the awshit!

15:30.515 --> 15:31.381
GILLETTE: What the hell.

15:31.383 --> 15:32.582
LANA: Is wrong with me?

15:32.584 --> 15:34.484
DRAKE: It's the artificial gravity!

15:34.486 --> 15:36.219
You have to readjust to it!

15:36.221 --> 15:39.855
LANA: I'll get my inner ear right on that...
DRAKE: We don't have time

15:39.857 --> 15:41.557
for this, they're --
HORIZON DRONE: There they are!

15:41.559 --> 15:42.291
Get 'em, get 'em!

15:42.293 --> 15:42.991
Drop your weapons!

15:42.993 --> 15:44.125
Drop your weapons!

15:44.127 --> 15:51.298
CYRIL: Suppressing -- So does
this run on batteries, or...?

15:51.300 --> 15:55.403
DRAKE: Fiiiiire!

15:55.405 --> 15:59.241
EVERYBODY: Get some! Get some!

15:59.243 --> 16:00.742
DRAKE: We're pinned down!

16:00.744 --> 16:01.944
LANA: Really?

16:01.946 --> 16:04.480
CHERYL/CAROL: You don't
think I could rock this?

16:04.482 --> 16:08.350
MALORY: Couple things...
One, I don't know what that means.

16:08.352 --> 16:11.421
And two... hang on.

16:11.423 --> 16:13.523
Hang on.

16:13.525 --> 16:16.859
Hang on.

16:16.861 --> 16:23.031
Hang on.

16:23.033 --> 16:26.834
And two, you obviously don't know
what "boarding party" means.

16:26.836 --> 16:31.105
CHERYL/CAROL: Who am I, sixteenth-century
female Irish pirate Gráinne O'Malley?

16:31.107 --> 16:33.607
Or her sole female descendant!

16:33.609 --> 16:34.808
ARCHER: I'm sorry.

16:34.810 --> 16:35.342
PAM: For what?

16:35.344 --> 16:37.811
Space-blastering me in
the frickin tits?!

16:37.813 --> 16:39.980
Or tricking me into that
fart-locker to get blasted into

16:39.982 --> 16:45.386
outer goddamn space on the off
chance you might wanna bang me!

16:45.388 --> 16:48.189
ARCHER: Both I guess, look --
PAM: After you blew me off

16:48.191 --> 16:50.826
for Katya the big-titted cyborg!

16:50.828 --> 16:53.895
Littleiss, uh...
ARCHER: R2-double-D2?

16:53.897 --> 16:54.863
PAM: Nice.

16:54.865 --> 16:57.999
ARCHER: Thanks, and I'm sorry,
but you gotta let me out, Pam,

16:58.001 --> 17:00.368
they're fighting
space-pirates out there!

17:00.370 --> 17:02.336
With Cyril!

17:02.338 --> 17:04.038
CYRIL: It's supposed to fire.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.573
What is wrong with you?

17:05.575 --> 17:07.474
ARCHER: And Lana can't even stand up!

17:07.477 --> 17:10.711
LANA: You idiot, just
reset the -- unghff!

17:10.713 --> 17:13.446
GILLETTE: Jesus, like a
dog in a station wagon.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.781
DRAKE: No, no!

17:14.782 --> 17:16.349
We're losing the beachhead!

17:16.352 --> 17:18.218
ARCHER: They're running
out of time, Pam!

17:18.220 --> 17:25.659
PAM: Oh, alright...
ARCHER: That being said... quickie?

17:25.661 --> 17:28.461
PAM: Meh.

17:28.463 --> 17:29.428
Whew!

17:29.430 --> 17:30.696
Okay, good luck.

17:30.698 --> 17:32.598
ARCHER: Thanks, normally
I'd say I don't need it,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.467
but I can barely feel my legs.

17:34.469 --> 17:36.469
PAM: I call that the MOAB.

17:36.471 --> 17:38.104
It stands for --
ARCHER: I know!

17:38.106 --> 17:41.240
What it stands for, I was there,
please don't say it out loud.

17:41.242 --> 17:49.115
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to...
Kick some space-pirate ass!

17:49.117 --> 17:49.983
Woooooo!

17:49.985 --> 17:50.817
EVERYBODY: Archer?!

17:50.819 --> 17:51.718
ARCHER: Hang on?

17:51.720 --> 17:53.020
Yes, Archer, duh.

17:53.022 --> 17:57.325
And if you're done doing each other's hair, let's --
DRAKE: Let's retake the shiiiiip!

17:57.327 --> 18:00.128
ARCHER: Or just run around
interrupting people.

18:00.130 --> 18:02.030
DRAKE: Gagh! I'm hit, I'm hit!

18:02.032 --> 18:06.301
ARCHER: Oh, for -- Do I
have to do everything?

18:06.303 --> 18:09.604
He asked, intending to be facetious!

18:09.606 --> 18:10.305
LANA: I'm sorry!

18:10.307 --> 18:11.940
I don't know what's wrong with me!

18:11.942 --> 18:14.141
ARCHER: Besides suffering
from gigantism?!

18:14.143 --> 18:14.909
LANA: Shut up.

18:14.911 --> 18:15.609
DRAKE: The bridge!

18:15.611 --> 18:18.744
We have to make it to the --
ARCHER: The bridge, yes, I heard you!

18:18.746 --> 18:21.079
So unless we're going the wrong way...!

18:21.081 --> 18:22.447
DRAKE: Uhh... oh.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.381
No, that's it right there.

18:23.383 --> 18:25.383
ARCHER: Then shut up! God!

18:25.385 --> 18:26.383
Okay, now what?

18:26.385 --> 18:27.317
You can un-shut up.

18:27.319 --> 18:31.020
DRAKE: The com-link, by the door...
Commander Kellogg?

18:31.022 --> 18:31.720
It's Drake!

18:31.722 --> 18:32.688
KELLOGG: Tony?!

18:32.690 --> 18:35.223
ARCHER: "Tony?!"

18:35.225 --> 18:37.292
KELLOGG: Oh my God,
am I glad to see you!

18:37.294 --> 18:38.760
We couldn't have held out much longer!

18:38.762 --> 18:41.262
DRAKE: Well, we got here
as fast as we could.

18:41.264 --> 18:42.296
KELLOGG: My God, you're wounded.

18:42.298 --> 18:46.200
Put him here, please, and we'll take those...
ARCHER: Uh, oh.

18:46.202 --> 18:49.536
Yeah, here you go...
KELLOGG: Oh dear, are you wounded too?

18:49.538 --> 18:51.938
LANA: No, just --
DRAKE: Just a little space-sickness.

18:51.940 --> 18:53.673
But eventually she'll get acclimated.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.475
LANA: I -- eventually?

18:55.477 --> 18:58.444
KELLOGG: Yes, she's strong,
good breeding stock.

18:58.446 --> 18:59.312
LANA: Wh-?! Hey!

18:59.314 --> 19:02.582
ARCHER: Whoa, Charles
Benedict Davenport.

19:02.584 --> 19:04.884
Uh, the father of eugenics.

19:04.886 --> 19:06.252
Seriously guys, read a book.

19:06.254 --> 19:10.823
DRAKE: And two more on the Intrepid,
stowaways, almost as good as her.

19:10.825 --> 19:11.790
KELLOGG: Two more?!

19:11.792 --> 19:15.193
Then we can populate Mars
even faster than we'd hoped!

19:15.195 --> 19:16.094
CYRIL: What? GILLETTE: What?

19:16.096 --> 19:17.795
LANA: Did you say Mars?!

19:17.797 --> 19:21.298
ARCHER: Oh now your ears --
wait, why did you say Mars?

19:21.300 --> 19:24.402
HORIZON DRONE: Don't you see?

19:24.404 --> 19:27.591
They're the mutineers!

19:32.777 --> 19:38.206
DRAKE: Welcome to the... Danger Zone!
