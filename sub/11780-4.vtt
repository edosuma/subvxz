EVERY TIME HE MEETS A CANVAS.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.819
I HOPE THEY DON'T BUY IT,

07:24.902 --> 07:26.654
AND I HOPE THEY
DON'T GET A TATTOO FROM HIM.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.322

IT'S REALLY HARD
TO SELL YOURSELF IN FIVE MINUTES

08:08.237 --> 08:11.657
TO SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT SOLID
ON THEIR OWN CONCEPT.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.243

THE STRENGTH OF AN OAK AND,

08:23.502 --> 08:26.505
LIKE, THE COLOR TONES
OF A FALLTIME MAPLE.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.673

08:30.676 --> 08:32.510

08:32.595 --> 08:35.431
{\an8}- THIS CANVAS WANTS
FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREES

08:35.514 --> 08:37.433

08:37.515 --> 08:38.768

THE OCTOPUS IDEA.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.813

08:43.898 --> 08:45.483

WORK OUT, MAN.

NO PROBLEM.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.236
- [scoffs]

08:50.029 --> 08:54.408
- CANVASES, YOU'VE BEEN RANDOMLY
ASSIGNED A PICKING ORDER.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.244
BRIAN, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.912
WHICH ARTIST
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHOOSE?

08:57.995 --> 08:59.372
- I CHOOSE CLEEN.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.957
IT SEEMED LIKE WE'D BE
WORKING REALLY WELL TOGETHER,

09:01.040 --> 09:03.543
AND HE HAD SOME GREAT IDEAS
FOR MY TATTOO.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.543
- ELISE?

09:04.627 --> 09:06.629
- I CHOOSE ERIK
FOR HIS EXPERIENCE,

09:06.712 --> 09:09.632
AND I THINK HE HAD
SOME REALLY GOOD DESIGN IDEAS.

09:09.715 --> 09:10.800
- AWESOME.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.218
- JESH?
- I CHOOSE EMILY.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.428
SHE BROUGHT ME A REALLY
CREATIVE IDEA WITH THE ROOTS

09:14.512 --> 09:17.890
AND THE PURPLE THAT I WANTED
TO INCORPORATE IN MY TREE.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.475
- FINALLY, RORY.

09:19.558 --> 09:22.436
- I ORIGINALLY WANTED CLEEN
AND ERIK,

09:22.520 --> 09:25.481
BUT MY THIRD CHOICE WOULD BE...

09:25.564 --> 09:28.067
{\an8}- I KNOW I GOT THIS.

09:28.150 --> 09:28.985
- JOSH.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.779
- [whistles]
THIRD CHOICE.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.906
- I DO JAPANESE WORK EVERY DAY.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.324
MAN, IT FEELS LIKE
I'M A LITTLE KID AGAIN

09:35.408 --> 09:36.993
NOT GETTING PICKED FOR SOFTBALL.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.327
THIS SUCKS.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.121
- FOUR OF YOU
WILL BE TATTOOING TODAY.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.916
YOU HAVE THREE HOURS
TO DESIGN AND TATTOO A TREE,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.962
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.589
{\an8}- TODAY, JUDGING COMPOSITION,
TREES ARE INTRICATE DESIGNS

09:50.673 --> 09:54.593
{\an8}WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS
LACED INTO ONE.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.554
WITH ONLY FOUR PEOPLE
TATTOOING TODAY,

09:56.637 --> 09:58.180
IT'S REALLY GONNA
UP THE STAKES

09:58.264 --> 10:01.225
ON HOW GOOD YOU HAVE TO TATTOO
TO REALLY MAKE A STANCE HERE.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.688
- YEAH,
THIS IS THE HARD PART, MAN.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.564
ONCE I'M DONE
WITH THE LINE WORK--

10:06.647 --> 10:08.441
- OH,
THEN DOING THE SHADING?

10:08.524 --> 10:10.276
- THE SHADING'S A PIECE OF CAKE.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.944
OF COURSE I GOT PICKED FIRST.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.362
{\an8}19 YEARS' EXPERIENCE,

10:13.446 --> 10:17.116
{\an8}GREAT PORTFOLIO,
BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.200
- HOW'S IT LOOKING?

10:18.284 --> 10:19.577
- PERFECT.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.369
I'M REALLY PUMPED I ONLY
GOT TO BEAT THREE OTHER PEOPLE

10:20.453 --> 10:23.331
TO GET THE SKULL PICK.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.334
{\an8}- I HAVE TO PROVE
THAT I AM THE TOP RUNNER

10:26.417 --> 10:28.502
{\an8}IN THIS COMPETITION.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.879
THEN SCOOT
A LITTLE BIT MORE AWAY FROM ME.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.047
I AM GOING
TO BE A RUNAWAY TRAIN.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.966
THESE OTHER FOOLS
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.636
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE
IN THIS COMPETITION AS A THREAT.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.429
PERFECT.

10:38.512 --> 10:42.058
- TWO HOURS REMAINING, GUYS.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.851
- I'M DOING, LIKE,
WHOLE ROOTS NOW

10:43.934 --> 10:44.852
JUST TO MAKE IT LOOK COOL.

10:44.935 --> 10:45.895
LAST WEEK, I WAS IN THE BOTTOM.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.731
{\an8}SO THIS WEEK,
I HAVE TO STEP UP MY GAME

10:48.814 --> 10:51.650
{\an8}AND SHOW THAT I STAND APART
FROM THE REST OF THE CROWD.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.070
STRESSED?
EH, JUST A LITTLE.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.404
- I WAS GONNA SAY,
I CAN'T TELL AT ALL.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.697
- I'M COOL AS A CUCUMBER.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.949
- YEAH.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.205
- WHOO!
GOT GOING ON IN HERE?

11:04.288 --> 11:05.456
- THIS IS WHERE THE HARASSMENT
COMES IN.

11:05.539 --> 11:09.585
{\an8}MY IDEA IS COMPLETELY ORIGINAL.

11:09.668 --> 11:12.922
THE OCTOPUS TENTACLES
EMULATE THE ROOTS OF THE TREE.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.592
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE
MAPLE COMING OUT OF THE TOP.

11:16.675 --> 11:17.259
- WHAT?
LOOK AT THOSE ROOTS.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.136
- HE SAID "HYBRID,"

11:19.220 --> 11:20.429
AND I THOUGHT HE MEANT ANIMAL.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.890
IT'S A WIN ALL OVER THE PLACE.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.141
- FIVE, FOUR,

11:24.225 --> 11:28.229
THREE, TWO, ONE.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.731
MACHINES DOWN.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.442
NO MORE TATTOOING.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.235
- WE KILLED IT.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.611
MY TATTOO LOOKS GREAT.

11:35.694 --> 11:36.946
{\an8}IT COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.615
- YOU KNOW, I WENT THROUGH
IN THE LITTLE EDGES

11:39.698 --> 11:40.574
AND MADE SURE
ALL THE LITTLE EDGES WERE EVEN,

11:40.658 --> 11:42.326
AND IT'S
MUCH MORE SATURATED NOW.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.037
- JOSH'S CHERRY BLOSSOM BRANCH
DOESN'T FLOW WITH THE BODY.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.415
IT'S JUST, BUNK,
TREE ON A GIRL'S SIDE.

11:47.498 --> 11:51.001
I FEEL BAD FOR HIS CANVAS.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.711
{\an8}- COLORED GEISHA ON MY RIBS.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.463
{\an8}- THAT'S JUST ASKING
TO BE SENT HOME.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.881
{\an8}- WHAT A [bleep] NIGHTMARE.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.299
- STOP BEING A PUSSY, MAN.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.760
IF YOU'RE MY COMPETITOR,
GIVE ME A FIGHT.

12:05.641 --> 12:06.809
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.520
IT'S TIME TO CRITIQUE YOUR WORK.
ERIK.

12:09.603 --> 12:10.938
- I LIKE THE WAY
THIS FLOWS ON THE BODY.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.983
I LIKE THE REALLY STRONG,
CLEAN ROOTS GOING ALL THE WAY

12:14.066 --> 12:15.401
UP TO THE OUT-OF-FOCUS LEAVES

12:15.484 --> 12:16.902
FOR THE BACKGROUND
AND THE FOREGROUND.

12:16.986 --> 12:17.945
IT'S A REALLY NICE TOUCH.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.655
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- CLEEN.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.824
- YOU PULLED OUT A LOT
OF NICE TRICKS IN THIS TATTOO.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.242
THE WAY YOU PUT THE DARK,
SOLID BLACK ROOTS IN THE BACK

12:23.325 --> 12:25.661
TO REALLY CREATE DEPTH,

12:25.744 --> 12:26.912
IT'S LIKE IT'S COMING OUT
IN ALL DIRECTIONS,

12:26.996 --> 12:28.747
AND THOSE ROOTS ARE GOING
EVERY WHICH WAY.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.207
I'M DEFINITELY MORE OF A FAN

12:30.291 --> 12:32.042
OF THE BOTTOM HALF OF
THIS TATTOO THAN I AM THE TOP.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.836
- I'M ACTUALLY A FAN
OF THE TOP OF THE TREE.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.838
HAVING THOSE SUBTLE LITTLE
PIECES OF BRANCH COME OUT

12:35.921 --> 12:37.006
WAS A REALLY NICE TOUCH.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.884
IT'S A GREAT TATTOO.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.093
- EMILY.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.179
- FOR THE COMPOSITION
OF THIS TATTOO,

12:43.262 --> 12:44.805
THE TREE IS STIFF UP TOP,

12:44.889 --> 12:47.558
AND THEN YOU HAVE
A VERY CONDENSED AMOUNT

12:47.641 --> 12:49.810
OF TENTACLES THAT ARE
PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME SHAPE.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.020
BE MINDFUL.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.605
WHEN WE GET TO WORK AROUND KNEES
AND ELBOWS,

12:52.688 --> 12:53.856
THOSE ARE MAGICAL PLACES,

12:53.939 --> 12:55.900
BECAUSE YOU GET A LOT
OF MOTION ALL THE TIME.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.903
USE THE BODY TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.321
- JOSH.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.907
- THE COMPOSITION OF THE TATTOO
FOR ME IS A LITTLE BIT STERN

13:02.990 --> 13:04.283
JUST FROM ONE SIDE.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.035
THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT A CHERRY BLOSSOM TREE

13:06.118 --> 13:08.704
IS THE FACT THAT THEY DIE
DIRECTLY AFTER FULL BLOOM,

13:08.787 --> 13:10.206
SO THEY'RE ALWAYS FALLING.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.834
MAYBE JUST A FEW FALLEN PETALS
COMING OVER THE FRONT OF HER HIP

13:13.918 --> 13:17.838
CREATES AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
FLOW THAT THEN BECOMES DYNAMIC.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.549
- I THINK AS FAR AS THE CLASSIC
LOOK OF THE CHERRY BLOSSOM,

13:20.633 --> 13:23.886
YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE MARK
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.932
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
HERE WE ARE TESTING COMPOSITION

13:28.015 --> 13:29.308
WITH TREE TATTOOS.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.102
WE HAD FOUR ARTISTS
THAT WERE PICKED BY A LANDSLIDE.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.270
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT JOSH
AND THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.857
- HE JUST DID
A VERY RIGID, SIMPLE TATTOO.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.734
- AND AGAIN TODAY, I THINK
IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY.

13:38.817 --> 13:39.985
- LET'S TALK ABOUT EMILY.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.906
- THE TATTOO WAS
TWO SEPARATE TATTOOS STACKED.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.449
- THE COMPOSITION, TO ME,

13:45.533 --> 13:47.910
WAS PROBABLY THE POOREST
IN THE ROOM.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.370
- I REALLY LIKE
CLEEN AND ERIK'S TATTOOS.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.915
THE COMPOSITION IN ERIK'S TATTOO
RIDES THE BODY BEAUTIFULLY.

13:52.998 --> 13:53.749
IT'S FEMININE AND DELICATE.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.501
HE HIT THIS ON ALL CYLINDERS.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.877
- CLEEN DID THE OAK TREE.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.546
- THE ROOT STRUCTURE
IS VERY COOL.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.880
IT HAS A NICE, DYNAMIC LOOK.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.967
HE WAS ABLE
TO CAPTURE A NICE DEPTH.

14:03.050 --> 14:03.717
- IT SOUNDS
LIKE WE'RE ALL AGREED.

14:03.801 --> 14:04.510
LET'S LET THEM KNOW.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.971
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:07.054 --> 14:11.642
TODAY FOUR OF YOU HAD TO TATTOO
A PERFECTLY COMPOSED TREE.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.019
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE WINNER

14:14.103 --> 14:15.354
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE
IS...

14:15.437 --> 14:18.274
[suspenseful music]

14:18.357 --> 14:20.442
♪ ♪

14:20.526 --> 14:23.529
ERIK.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.406
- THE FLOW OF THIS TATTOO
WAS REALLY NICE.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.075
ACTUALLY HAVING THE SENSE
TO KNOW HOW TO USE THE BODY

14:28.158 --> 14:29.743
TO WORK WITH YOUR TATTOO

14:29.827 --> 14:31.870
IS WHAT REALLY WON THE CHALLENGE
FOR ME.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.414
- I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.292
- ERIK, YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

14:36.375 --> 14:37.585
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.920
{\an8}- I THINK HE GOT POINTS
FOR JUST DOING A BIG TATTOO.

14:40.004 --> 14:40.963
THIS IS BULL[bleep].

14:41.046 --> 14:42.423
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
TO PREPARE

14:42.506 --> 14:45.009
TO MEET YOUR CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.683
- YOU DID A NICE TATTOO.
- THANK YOU.

14:52.766 --> 14:53.559
- YEAH, NOW YOU
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

14:53.642 --> 14:54.685
- FEELS GOOD.

14:54.768 --> 14:55.978
I'VE BEEN LIVING
IN PEOPLE'S SHADOW,

14:56.061 --> 14:57.479
AND NOW I GOT
TO HAND OUT SKULLS.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.773
I HAVE A FEW IDEAS IN MY HEAD
HOW I WANT TO PLAY IT.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.818
- BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG
PROBLEM HERE--JOSH AND CLEEN.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.153
WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO WITH THEM?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.321
- I JUST WANT
TO KNOCK THEM DOWN A PEG.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.115
- WELL, HERE'S A SUGGESTION
ABOUT JOSH.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.074
HE DOESN'T DRAW VERY WELL.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.368
HE KNOWS IT.
HE DOES NOT EVEN--

15:11.452 --> 15:13.746
- WAIT, YOU'RE TELLING ME
A TATTOO ARTIST THAT CAN'T DRAW?

15:13.829 --> 15:14.872
THIS IS A COMPETITION.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.915
{\an8}DRAW YOUR OWN GODDAMN TATTOOS.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.209
I MEAN, JUST OUT OF PRINCIPLE,
THAT ANNOYS THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.670
- I SURE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM
GET SCHOOLED ON THAT.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.340
IT COULD TWIST THIS COMPETITION
IN A REALLY GOOD WAY

15:24.423 --> 15:27.801
IF YOU WERE TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DIAL HIM IN.

15:43.192 --> 15:43.901
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:43.984 --> 15:47.488
FAIL AND YOU CAN KISS $100,000,

15:47.571 --> 15:49.114
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

15:49.198 --> 15:51.408
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER
GOOD-BYE.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.202
- NOT ME.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.330
- YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUÑEZ,

15:56.413 --> 15:57.623
AND MYSELF.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.249
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.378
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.713
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

16:04.797 --> 16:08.634
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOO
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

16:08.717 --> 16:12.221
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.057
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

16:15.140 --> 16:16.725
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.187
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING COMPOSITION.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.481
- COMPOSITION IS WHERE YOU
PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.899
{\an8}THE FOREGROUND, THE BACKGROUND,

16:23.982 --> 16:27.236
{\an8}AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN TO
MAKE ONE SOLID, COHESIVE IMAGE.

16:27.319 --> 16:31.490
- TODAY YOU MUST TATTOO
JAPANESE GEISHAS.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.329
{\an8}JAPANESE WORK IS WHAT I DO
FOR A LIVING EVERY DAY.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.122
THIS IS MY PASSION.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.416
I NEED TO BRING IT ON THIS ONE,

16:40.499 --> 16:41.959
AND I CAN'T WAIT.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.044
- IT'S NOT JUST
THE GEISHA HERSELF.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.921
IT'S THE FANS, FLOWERS,

16:46.004 --> 16:48.132
AND OTHER ACCESSORIES PLACED
WITH AN EYE TO COMPOSITION

16:48.215 --> 16:51.593
TO MAKE YOUR GEISHA
BEAUTIFUL AND ALLURING.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.678
- I'M ON IT.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.430
{\an8}TRADITIONAL JAPANESE
HAS A LOT OF RULES,

16:54.513 --> 16:58.183
{\an8}AND IF YOU'RE MISSING ONE OF
THEM, YOU JUST DROPPED THE BALL.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.145
{\an8}- BE MINDFUL
OF HOW YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.647
{\an8}GEISHAS ARE A THING OF BEAUTY.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.108
{\an8}- THE PRESSURE
OF CHRIS NUÑEZ BEING THE JUDGE

17:06.191 --> 17:10.237
{\an8}OF A JAPANESE TATTOO
IS STRESSFUL.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.906
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.288
ERIK,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.624
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.417
{\an8}- I'M GUNNING FOR JOSH,
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE

17:24.501 --> 17:25.836
{\an8}IF HE CAN ACTUALLY DRAW.

17:25.919 --> 17:26.795
{\an8}AND IF YOU CAN'T,
THEN YOU'RE NOT AN INK MASTER.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.088
{\an8}WHAT'S YOUR IDEA?

17:28.172 --> 17:30.466
{\an8}- FULL BODY GEISHA
WITH KOI SWIMMING AROUND HER.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.842
{\an8}- I'M THE ONE TO BEAT.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.303
{\an8}IF ERIK DOES NOT GUN FOR ME
IN THIS SKULL PICK TODAY,

17:34.386 --> 17:36.305
{\an8}HE'S AN IDIOT.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.016
- I'M LOOKING FOR
A COLOR GEISHA ON MY RIGHT ARM.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.101
- YEAH, I WANT THAT ONE.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.436
- COLOR GEISHA ON MY RIBS.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.354
- DAMN.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.817
- GEISHA ON MY RIB CAGE.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.323
- I SPECIALIZE
IN JAPANESE TATTOOS.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.241
THIS IS
WHERE MY COMFORT ZONE IS.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.619
{\an8}I'M READY TO WIPE THE FLOOR WITH
THE REST OF THE COMPETITORS.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.086
- THERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.755
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:09.838 --> 18:11.423
PLEASE READ THE NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.884
- AARON.

18:13.967 --> 18:14.885
- ANGEL.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.011
- RIGHT HERE.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.596
- TIM.
- OH, YEAH.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.473
- TY'ESHA.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.309
- ERIK.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.269
{\an8}- TWO PEOPLE WANT A TATTOO
ON THEIR RIBS.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.774
THAT'S JUST ASKING
TO BE SENT HOME.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.819
[dramatic music]

18:31.902 --> 18:33.111
♪ ♪

18:33.195 --> 18:34.613
- JOSH.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.032
- ERIK CAN WASTE AS MANY OF
THOSE SKULLS AS HE WANTS ON ME

18:37.115 --> 18:38.450
'CAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO BLOW UP IN HIS FACE.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.495
{\an8}WHATEVER, I GOT THIS.

18:41.578 --> 18:42.704
{\an8}- MARK.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.081
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT THIS CANVAS,

18:44.164 --> 18:46.375
{\an8}BECAUSE I SIMPLY DO NOT WANT
TO DO GEISHA GIRL ON RIBS.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.126
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.254
- STIRRING THE POT.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.004
- EMILY.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.589
- JASON.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.550
- ROBBIE.

18:54.633 --> 18:59.221
- JULIA.
- CRIS.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.430
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

19:00.514 --> 19:00.931
- THAT'S ME.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.724
- AWESOME.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.143
- REMEMBER,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:04.226 --> 19:08.188
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

19:08.272 --> 19:11.233
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST
AND PUT ONE ARTIST

19:11.316 --> 19:12.401
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.404
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A GEISHA.

19:15.487 --> 19:20.826
AND BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.120
GOOD LUCK.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.538
{\an8}- TODAY I'M GONNA
BE A LITTLE MORE CRITICAL

19:24.621 --> 19:27.416
{\an8}BECAUSE THIS IS IMAGERY
THAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.500
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YOU TOO.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.418
- COME WITH ME.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.128
- THE DETAILS NEED TO BE PERFECT

19:31.211 --> 19:34.047
AND SPOT-ON FOR THE COMPOSITION
TO FLOW NICELY.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.341
- DON'T DO LITTLE DETAIL STUFF.
- ALL RIGHT.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.677
- BIG AND BOLD WILL HOLD.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.096
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU WANT TO GET
WHAT PART OF YOUR BODY DONE?

19:41.179 --> 19:42.514
- ON MY RIBS ON THIS SIDE.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.392
{\an8}- I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING
TO BE DOING A RIB TATTOO TODAY.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.769
THE ONLY ISSUE
WITH THE SIDE IS THE TIME.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.438
WHATEVER I WOULD NORMALLY
BE ABLE TO GET DONE, SAY,

19:49.521 --> 19:52.858
ON YOUR ARM, I CAN DO
ABOUT HALF OF THAT ON YOUR SIDE.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.276
I COULD SELL ICE TO A PENGUIN.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.111
I KNOW THAT I CAN CHANGE
THE CANVAS'S MIND.

19:56.194 --> 19:57.279
- LIKE, ON MY THIGHS
RIGHT HERE.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.447
- SOMETHING
THAT WOULD SIT HERE

19:58.530 --> 19:59.615
OR SOMETHING
THAT WOULD SIT HERE.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.533
I THINK
THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.951
- YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.
- OKAY.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.578
- THE THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS

20:04.661 --> 20:06.955
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT
ON YOUR RIBS FOR SIX HOURS.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.457
- I KNOW IT'S GONNA HURT.
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.918
{\an8}- THE RIB SUCKS.
IT HURTS LIKE A BITCH.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.294
I'VE GOT
TO TALK MY CANVAS OUT OF THIS.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.713
- I'VE ALREADY COME INTO IT
EXPECTING IT TO HURT.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.049
- THERE'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH
DETAIL ON THE GEISHA GIRL

20:17.132 --> 20:18.634
TO SIT HERE FOR SIX HOURS

20:18.717 --> 20:20.719
WHILE SHE'S SQUIRMING AROUND
AND TRY TO DO A RIB TATTOO.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.222
IT'S GONNA BE, LIKE, TWICE
AS PAINFUL HERE THAN HERE.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.515
- I'LL BE OKAY.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.559
- WHAT A [bleep] NIGHTMARE.

20:36.276 --> 20:40.906
- [bleep].

20:40.989 --> 20:41.949
ALL RIGHT.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.825
ERIK, COME HELP ME WITH THIS.
- WHAT?

20:43.909 --> 20:46.745
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT HOW I WOULD DO THE WAVES?

20:46.828 --> 20:48.497
I MEAN, I HAD THEM
KIND OF BURSTING OUT THAT WAY.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.039
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

20:49.122 --> 20:50.958
LOOKS GOOD?

20:51.041 --> 20:52.376
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHY JOSH
IS ASKING ME FOR ADVICE.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.586
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
COMPOSITION,

20:54.670 --> 20:55.921
AND HE'S PROVING IT.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.172
THIS IS A COMPETITION.
YOU'RE HERE TO WIN.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.757
EITHER YOU'RE THE BEST
OR YOU'RE NOT.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.342
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT JUST HAVING THE WATER

21:00.425 --> 21:03.345
KIND OF COME UP AND KIND OF
JUST TURN INTO THE CLOUD?

21:03.428 --> 21:04.805
- THE ONLY THING
I'M GONNA SAY IS,

21:04.888 --> 21:06.640
I WOULD NOT BRING
THE WATER UP INTO THE CLOUDS.

21:06.723 --> 21:07.307
- DON'T BLEND THIS HERE?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.184
- NO, IT MAKES NO SENSE.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.602
- NICE. THANKS
FOR A GREAT CANVAS BY THE WAY.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.103
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.980
THANK YOU.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.773
- TEACHER, TEACH ME HOW TO DRAW.

21:14.856 --> 21:15.816
TEACH ME HOW TO DRAW.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.025
- LIKE, REALLY, DUDE.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.193
- I DON'T GET IT.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.112
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO DRAW IT FOR HIM?

21:20.195 --> 21:22.322
- WHATEVER, THAT WAS
MY GOOD DEED FOR THE DAY.

21:25.283 --> 21:28.996
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A JAPANESE GEISHA.

21:29.079 --> 21:33.041
YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.376
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.545
- LET'S GO.
- LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR ME.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.879
{\an8}- IN ANY JAPANESE DESIGN,

21:37.963 --> 21:40.215
{\an8}COMPOSITION
IS AT THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE.

21:40.298 --> 21:42.175
NOT JUST THE ELEMENTS
WITHIN THE TATTOO,

21:42.259 --> 21:44.219
BUT IT'S ALSO YOUR DESIGN
FITTING TO THE BODY.

21:44.302 --> 21:45.429
- I THINK
WE SHOULD BRING IT DOWN

21:45.512 --> 21:47.222
WHERE THE TOP OF IT STARTS HERE.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.724
- LIFE DOES GIVE YOU LEMONS.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.975
YOU GOT TO MAKE IT LEMONADE.

21:50.058 --> 21:52.728
- LET'S DO THIS.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.232
- I'M GONNA PROBABLY
TRAIL A LITTLE BIT

21:57.315 --> 21:59.067
GOING DOWN THERE AND STUFF.
- I LIKE THAT.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.236
- TRY TO HAVE, LIKE,
SOME NICE FADE OFF IN THERE.

22:01.319 --> 22:03.405
{\an8}THIS GUY WANTS A FULL-BODY
GEISHA WITH KOI FISH

22:03.488 --> 22:05.365
{\an8}AND A CHERRY BLOSSOM TREE
IN THE BACKGROUND.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.035
{\an8}THERE ARE SO MANY ELEMENTS
IN THIS TATTOO

22:08.118 --> 22:11.580
{\an8}THAT GETTING COMPOSITION RIGHT
IS ALMOST NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.583
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW
HOW HUNGRY CRIS IS RIGHT NOW,

22:14.666 --> 22:16.877
{\an8}BUT I BELIEVE
I'M HUNGRIER THAN HIM.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.670
- HEY, I'LL TOUGH IT OUT.
LET'S GO FOR IT.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.422
- I TOOK A HUGE CHANCE

22:20.505 --> 22:24.092
DRAWING THE DESIGN BASED
ON WHAT MY CANVAS IS ASKING FOR.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.635
IT'S NOT A TRADITIONAL GEISHA,

22:25.719 --> 22:28.138
BUT OVERALL, I'M REALLY HAPPY
WITH THIS DESIGN.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.058
I INTEND TO GO ALL-IN ON THIS.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.268
- ANOTHER HUGE TATTOO
FROM THE GUY.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.186
- OH, MAN.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.188
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
- DUDE.

22:36.271 --> 22:38.148
- ANGEL SEEMS TO BE
HAVING A REALLY ROUGH TIME.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.484
HE'S GOT A GEISHA
WITH AN UMBRELLA.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.070
THE COMPOSITION ON THIS TATTOO
IS INCREDIBLY STIFF.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.237
IT'S JUST LOST.

22:44.321 --> 22:48.116
{\an8}THE WHOLE TATTOO IS BEAT.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.951
{\an8}- OW.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.079
{\an8}IT'S STARTING
TO KIND OF HURT REALLY BAD.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.081
{\an8}- SIT NICE AND STILL FOR ME.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.541
{\an8}RIB TATTOOS HURT
WAY MORE THAN CHICKS THINK.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.211
- I'M STARTING TO GET RESTLESS.
- I CAN TELL.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.670
MY CANVAS IS SQUIRMING...

23:00.754 --> 23:02.464
- OW.
IT'S REALLY INTENSE.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.673
- WHICH IS MAKING IT REALLY HARD

23:03.757 --> 23:05.342
FOR ME TO LAY DOWN
A CLEAN OUTLINE.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.009
AT THIS POINT,
I JUST WANT TO TIE HER DOWN,

23:06.093 --> 23:09.471
SO SHE STOPS MOVING.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.597
- TWO HOURS REMAINING.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.016
TWO MORE HOURS REMAINING.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.982
- TIM, YOU'RE GOING HOME
WITH THIS TATTOO.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.275
AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING THIS TIME.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.735
- EMILY'S GOING OUT OF HER WAY

23:23.819 --> 23:26.321
TO WAKE THE BEAST
THAT I'M TRYING TO CONTAIN.

23:26.404 --> 23:28.490
{\an8}I LIVED ON AND OFF THE STREETS
AND IN AND OUT OF SHELTERS

23:28.573 --> 23:29.950
{\an8}FROM THE TIME I WAS 12 TO 16.

23:30.033 --> 23:33.036
IT TAUGHT ME TO BE AGGRESSIVE
FIRST, THEN NICE LATER.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.454
IT'S STILL A PART OF ME TODAY,

23:34.538 --> 23:36.164
AND IT'S SOMETHING
I'M TRYING TO OVERCOME.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.917
BUT EMILY IS REALLY
PUSHING MY PATIENCE.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.008
- IT LOOKS PRETTY SOLID.
DON'T YOU THINK?

23:47.092 --> 23:48.844
- YEAH, MAN.
IT LOOKS FRICKING AWESOME.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.596
{\an8}- THIS TATTOO'S TURNING OUT
EXACTLY HOW I PLANNED.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.349
I'M SO ECSTATIC, I'D WEAR THIS
MYSELF IN A HEARTBEAT.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.017
I AM HERE TO PROVE TO THE WORLD

23:56.101 --> 23:57.352
AND EVERYBODY
IN THIS COMPETITION

23:57.435 --> 23:59.521
THAT I AM AN AMAZING
JAPANESE STYLE TATTOO ARTIST.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.774
AND I BETTER TAKE THIS ONE HOME.
- GOOD, DUDE.

24:02.858 --> 24:06.361
THE ONLY ONE I SEE RIGHT NOW
IS RIGHT THERE AND THEN...

24:06.444 --> 24:07.529
- RIGHT WHERE?
- THIS.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.531
RIGHT WHERE THAT
ALMOST MEETS THE FACE.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.032
- REALLY, IS JOSH
GONNA COME OVER

24:11.116 --> 24:13.535
AND TRY TO GIVE ME ADVICE
ON JAPANESE CHALLENGE DAY?

24:13.618 --> 24:15.078
[scoffs]
I THINK NOT.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.454
I'VE GOT THIS COVERED, BUDDY.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.332
THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.293
{\an8}- I HAVEN'T STUDIED
TRADITIONAL JAPANESE TATTOOS

24:21.376 --> 24:22.544
{\an8}AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO,

24:22.627 --> 24:24.004
{\an8}SO I'M GONNA DO
WHAT MY STRONG POINT IS HERE

24:24.087 --> 24:25.088
{\an8}AND GO WITH REALISM.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.882
I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS GONNA SET ME APART

24:26.965 --> 24:28.300
FROM THE REST OF THE GROUP.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.217
AND WHEN I BEAT JASON
AT WHAT HE DOES EVERY DAY,

24:29.301 --> 24:33.054
HE'S GONNA LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.850
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

24:36.933 --> 24:39.269
SEVEN, SIX,

24:39.352 --> 24:41.730
FIVE, FOUR,

24:41.813 --> 24:45.025
THREE, TWO, ONE.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.526
THAT IS IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.070
TIME IS UP.
NO MORE TATTOOING.

24:52.115 --> 24:54.910
- OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE IT.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.995
- IT'S SO BRIGHT
AND BOLD AND COLORFUL.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.079
I LOVE IT.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.122
- I'M SUPER STOKED.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.415
- YEAH, THE KIMONO
IS VERY DETAILED.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.251
- YEAH,
I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH IT.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.171
- JOSH DOING A PHOTO-REALISTIC
GEISHA IS ALL BULL[bleep].

25:06.254 --> 25:07.631
HE DIDN'T DRAW IT, AND
HE PULLED IT OFF THE INTERNET.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.842
{\an8}WHEN I DRAW A TATTOO,
IT'S MY IMAGINATION.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.260
{\an8}IT'S MY HANDS DOING THE ARTWORK.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.429
{\an8}BY HIM TRACING, IT'S A COP-OUT.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.850
{\an8}- DO YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
BE A STUPID BITCH?

25:18.934 --> 25:21.186
{\an8}- OH.

25:21.269 --> 25:23.146
- I JUST DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE MY LAST TATTOO.

25:23.230 --> 25:23.980
- YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.482
- I GAVE UP BEFORE I STARTED.

25:25.565 --> 25:26.691
- THIS IS SUICIDE.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.742
- I HAVE A FEELING
WE'RE GONNA GET JUST BLASTED.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.702
- I COULD'VE DEFINITELY
DID A BETTER DESIGN.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.788
- I CAN'T EVEN SAY
THAT I'M PROUD OF THIS TATTOO.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.331
- I WAS VERY PROUD OF MY WORK.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.792
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.961
- WHO DO YOU THINK
WAS THE WORST TATTOO?

25:46.044 --> 25:48.922
- YOURS, WAY TOWARDS THE END,
DIDN'T HAVE A NOSE STILL.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.048
DID YOU EVER ADD A NOSE TO IT?
- YEAH, I DID.

25:50.131 --> 25:54.970
- OH, OKAY,
WELL, YOURS WAS MICROSCOPIC.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.472
TIM'S LOOKED LIKE
SOME REALLY BAD CHINESE

25:57.555 --> 25:59.391
KNOCK-OFF TRINKET KIND OF TOY.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.309
IT DIDN'T EVEN LOOK JAPANESE.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.728
HE DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE IN THIS COMPETITION

26:03.812 --> 26:05.814
JUST FOR THAT REASON.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.649
- DO YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
BE A STUPID BITCH?

26:07.732 --> 26:08.900
- OH.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.235
- YOUR TATTOO WASN'T EVEN DONE
THAT WELL.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.611
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS
ANYTHING REALLY GREAT ABOUT IT.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.281
- LUCKILY YOU'RE NOT A JUDGE,
JOSH, SO--

26:14.364 --> 26:16.574
- YEAH.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.172

YOU ALL WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD

26:31.256 --> 26:35.635
TATTOOING A SYMBOL OF BEAUTY,
A JAPANESE GEISHA.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.930
ERIK, LET'S START WITH YOU.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.640
YOU DO A LOT OF JAPANESE
YOURSELF.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.350
DID YOU FEEL
THAT THERE WAS AN ADVANTAGE

26:42.434 --> 26:43.560
BECAUSE OF YOUR BACKGROUND?

26:43.643 --> 26:45.979
- YES.
- IT'S A DECAPITATED GEISHA.

26:46.062 --> 26:46.730
CORRECT?
- YES.

26:46.813 --> 26:47.856
- IF I CUT YOUR HEAD OFF,

26:47.939 --> 26:49.524
WOULD YOU STILL HAVE THAT PUCKER
AND THAT--

26:49.607 --> 26:50.567
- WELL, THAT--

26:50.650 --> 26:52.193
- WOULD YOU LOOK SHARP
WITH THIS?

26:52.277 --> 26:53.820
- INK HER DEAD.
GIVE HER AN EXPRESSION OF DEATH.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.864
- LISTEN, I WANTED TO DO IT.
I WAS GONNA DO IT.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.866
LIKE, TEETH CLENCHED
AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.035
- LOOK AT THE EYES.
WHY JUST A FIELD OF BLUE?

27:00.118 --> 27:02.203
YOU DIDN'T SHOW OFF.
YOU DIDN'T SHOWCASE.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.205
THIS WAS YOUR CHANCE

THIS WAS YOUR DAY.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.835
- [sighs]

27:08.918 --> 27:11.296
- DON.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.048
- THE COMPOSITION
ON THIS IS ROUGH.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.257
THIS IS A GEISHA
ON A HUNGER STRIKE.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.718
YOU HIGHLIGHTED HER COLLAR BONE.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.553
THAT TELLS ME THAT
SHE'S DEHYDRATED AND HUNGRY.

27:18.636 --> 27:20.055
SHE HAS WAR PAINT ON.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.681
THE PAINT SHOULD NEVER GO
ALL THE WAY BACK

27:21.765 --> 27:23.183
TO THE EAR
AND INSIDE THE HAIR.

27:23.266 --> 27:25.143
- THAT WAS JUST
ME BEING IGNORANT OF IT.

27:25.226 --> 27:26.936
- THERE'S NOTHING PLEASING
ABOUT IT.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.313
YOU SHOULD FEEL INCREDIBLY LUCKY

27:28.396 --> 27:31.232
THAT THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT ARE JUST WORSE THAN YOU.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.277
- [mouths word]

27:34.986 --> 27:36.279
- JOSH.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.615
- SUPER SMOOTH TATTOO.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.742
AS CLOSE TO FLAWLESS OUTLINE
AS YOU CAN GET.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.161
VIBRANT COLORS.
FLOWER REALLY POPS.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.829
- IT'S TECHNICALLY SOLID.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.122
BUT YOUR BACKGROUND

27:46.206 --> 27:47.707
VERSUS YOUR FOREGROUND--
IT'S JUST ALL CLASHING.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.627
WHEN IT COMES TO DOING SOMETHING
THAT FLOWS

27:50.710 --> 27:53.380
THAT HAS A NATURAL RHYTHM
WITHIN THE COMPOSITION,

27:53.463 --> 27:56.007
YOU'RE WAY OFF.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.803
- JASON.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.722
- YOUR COMPOSITION
ON THIS TATTOO--VERY SIMPLE.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.516
SHE'S GOT THAT CLASSIC LOOK.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.850
THAT PLAIN FACE

28:05.934 --> 28:08.770
JUST LENDS ITSELF
TO A THING OF BEAUTY AS IT IS.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.563
THE PATTERN WORK
PLAYS VERY WELL.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.273
ONE OF THE NICEST PATTERNS
OF THE DAY.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.944
- IT'S DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE
TATTOO I'VE EVER SEEN YOU DO.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.656
- [sighs]

28:19.739 --> 28:21.950
- JULIA.

28:22.033 --> 28:27.455
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S
HAUNTING AND SAD ABOUT THIS ONE,

28:27.539 --> 28:28.665
AND I FIND THAT BEAUTIFUL.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.625
- AS FAR AS COMPOSITION GOES,

28:30.708 --> 28:33.336
I DO NOT LIKE THE ROSES
ON THE ROBE.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.380
IF IT'S A PATTERN,
THEY'D ALL BE THE SAME.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.298
THESE LOOK VERY HAPHAZARD.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.384
- TY'ESHA.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.385
- IT'S A ROUGH ONE.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.095
SHAPE OF THAT UMBRELLA--

28:42.178 --> 28:43.304
IT'S OUT OF SHAPE.
IT'S WONKY.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.974
- I JUST FELT RUSHED
THROUGH THE WHOLE TATTOO.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.892
- YOU'RE MISSING SO MANY THINGS
IN IT.

28:47.976 --> 28:48.768
WHERE DID YOU SPEND YOUR TIME?

28:48.852 --> 28:49.894
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE FINGERS.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.813
- I BIT OFF
WAY MORE THAN I COULD CHEW.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.940
- WOW US
WITH TECHNICAL PRECISION.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.734
DON'T TRY TO WOW US WITH SIZE.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.863
- ROBBIE.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.825
I REALLY LOVED
HOW CLEAN THE FACE IS.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.661
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO JAPANESE STUFF,

29:06.744 --> 29:07.954
SO I KEPT IT AS SIMPLE
AS I COULD.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.790
- YOU DID A GOOD JOB
PICKING THE DESIGN.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.375
IT'S GOT A LOT
OF GOOD COLOR PLAY IN IT,

29:12.459 --> 29:14.043
AND YOU'RE ONE
OF THE FEW PEOPLE

29:14.127 --> 29:16.838
THAT DID A REPETITIVE PATTERN
THAT DIDN'T TOTALLY SCREW IT UP.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.090
DEFINITELY CLEANER
THAN YOUR OTHER TATTOOS.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.176
- APPRECIATE IT.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.343
- TIM.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.846
- COMPOSITION-WISE,
IT'S PRETTY ROUGH.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.390
THIS BACKGROUND,
IT'S A BAD, AWKWARD SHAPE.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.391
IT'S GOT A TINY LITTLE HAND.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.852
HER FACE IS REALLY,
REALLY SQUASHED.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.520
- WITH THE PINUP
THAT WE SAW FROM YOU,

29:32.604 --> 29:35.064
TODAY WAS THE DAY THAT YOU
HAD TO COME OUT OF THE GATE

29:35.148 --> 29:36.608
WITH SOMETHING STRONG.

29:36.691 --> 29:39.068
THERE'S JUST NOTHING IN HERE
THAT IS CHANGING OUR MINDS

29:39.152 --> 29:40.904
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING MORE
TO SEE FROM YOU.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.700
- [snickers]

29:45.783 --> 29:47.535
- CLEEN.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.953
- OVERALL COMPOSITION--

29:49.037 --> 29:51.372
I LIKE THE WAY YOU SLEEVED OUT
THIS ONE INSIDE OF THE ARM.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.333
THERE'S A LOT OF NICE LITTLE
TRICKY DETAILS IN IT.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.376
PUTTING THAT GRAY SKIN
UP TO HER FACE

29:55.460 --> 29:56.878
AND LEAVING HER FACE WHITE
IN THE MIDDLE THERE--

29:56.961 --> 30:00.381
THAT'S THE CONTRAST IT NEEDED
TO GIVE HER THAT PALE LOOK.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.758
- IF OTHER PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS,

30:01.841 --> 30:04.385
THEY CAN SEE THAT JUST
WITH AN OUTLINE AND SOLID COLOR,

30:04.469 --> 30:06.221
YOU CAN MAKE
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.972
REALLY STRONG OUTING
AGAINST EVERYBODY HERE.

30:11.601 --> 30:14.604
- AARON.
- THIS THING--

30:14.687 --> 30:16.231
IT'S AN EYESORE, MAN.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.899
YOU GOT A CRAZY NOSE
AND SOME CRAZY LIPS.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.319
- I'M A PORTRAIT ARTIST.
I CAN NAIL A PORTRAIT.

30:21.402 --> 30:22.820
BUT ANY TIME
I HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ANIMATED

30:22.904 --> 30:24.572
OR DRAWN,
I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD AT IT.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.659
- IF YOU CAN COPY A PORTRAIT,
WHICH IS AN AMAZING TALENT,

30:27.742 --> 30:30.912
HOW CAN YOU NOT
COPY SOMETHING SIMPLE?

30:30.995 --> 30:33.581
- EMILY.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.667
- I LIKE THIS IMAGE A LOT.

30:35.750 --> 30:36.918
I LIKE THE WAY IT FITS.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.086
YOU GOT A NICE BOLD LINE
ON THE KIMONO,

30:38.169 --> 30:40.797
BUT YOU LOST IT ON THAT LINE
IN THE FACE.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.131
THAT'S THE ONE LINE

30:42.215 --> 30:44.217
ON THIS TATTOO THAT REALLY
DOES HAVE TO BE PERFECT.

30:44.300 --> 30:48.054
A FLAWLESS APPLICATION COULD'VE
BEEN A WIN WITH THIS TATTOO.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.059
- RYAN.

30:53.142 --> 30:54.936
- THE MORE SIMPLE
THAT A TATTOO CAN BE,

30:55.019 --> 30:56.938
THE MORE ACCURATE
YOU HAVE TO BE.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.439
EVERY BIT OF THIS OUTLINE--

30:58.523 --> 31:01.401
THE TOP OF THE HAIR
AND THE NONSOLID BLACK

31:01.484 --> 31:03.069
IN THE FIRST PART OF THE HAIR--

31:03.152 --> 31:04.320
IT'S NOT EVEN SOLID.

31:04.404 --> 31:08.116
THE INADEQUACIES
OF THE OUTLINE STAND OUT HUGE.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.785
THE MORE SIMPLE,
THE MORE PERFECT.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.623
- MARK.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.167
- HOLY COW, THIS THING
IS HAMMERED IN THERE AND ROUGH.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.336
- YOUR OUTLINES IN THIS
ARE THE WORST OF THE DAY.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.505
AND WE'VE SEEN YOU
GO BACK AND FORTH.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.215
AND IT'S LIKE,
OKAY, IT'S GONNA GET BETTER.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.217
YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK
AND SHINE, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.761
- I JUST DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE MY LAST TATTOO.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.638
I WANT A CHANCE
TO REDEEM MYSELF.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.974
- YOU OBVIOUSLY GOT RATTLED

31:33.057 --> 31:34.642
RIGHT OUT THE GATE
IN THIS COMPETITION.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.020
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT
TO NOT BE THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.816
- ANGEL.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.614
- COMPOSITION-WISE,
I DON'T HATE THE DESIGN.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.699
I DON'T HATE THE LAYOUT.
I DON'T HATE THE SHAPE.

31:49.782 --> 31:50.908
THE PROBLEM
WITH YOUR PATTERN IS,

31:50.992 --> 31:52.243
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT REPETITIVE.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.704
YOU SEE WHERE THERE'S THREE
OF THOSE IMAGES,

31:54.787 --> 31:56.998
AND THEY'RE
THREE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ONES.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.667
IF YOU WOULD'VE PUT A PATTERN
IN THERE THAT MADE SENSE,

31:59.751 --> 32:02.587
YOU WOULD'VE HAD
A SOLID TATTOO.

32:02.670 --> 32:05.298
- CRIS.

32:05.381 --> 32:06.966
- IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
A HUGE WOMAN.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.969
THE ROBE, THE SKIN,
THE FISH, THE BACKGROUND--

32:10.053 --> 32:11.262
IT'S ALL BLACK.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.597
THEY DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.723
- THE COMPOSITION
ON THIS IS ROUGH.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.892
- HONESTLY, MAN,
I GAVE UP BEFORE I STARTED.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.352
I JUST COULDN'T CLICK
WITH THE GUY.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.686
- THIS IS SUICIDE,

32:18.770 --> 32:20.355
'CAUSE IF YOU GAVE UP
BEFORE YOU STARTED, MAN,

32:20.438 --> 32:21.689
WE COULD GIVE UP RIGHT NOW

32:21.773 --> 32:22.815
AND, LIKE,
SPARE EVERYBODY THE CRITIQUE

32:22.899 --> 32:24.150
AND SEND YOU PACKING NOW.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.694
- I JUST TRY NOT
TO TAKE IT EMOTIONALLY.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.197
- LISTEN, YOU'RE DOING A TATTOO
ON ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.491
THEY GOT TO LIVE WITH IT
EMOTIONALLY FOREVER.

32:32.992 --> 32:33.743
- WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU DOING?

32:33.826 --> 32:35.078
- I TAKE THIS STUFF TO HEART,

32:35.161 --> 32:37.205
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT QUALITY
AND CRAFTSMANSHIP

32:37.288 --> 32:40.124
AND WHAT YOU'RE GIVING
TO THE CLIENT.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.377
AND THAT'S IT.
IT'S A TOUGH DAY, MAN.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.712
IT'S A TOUGH DAY.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.547
- SO NOW IT'S TIME
TO POLL THE JUDGES

32:46.631 --> 32:48.216
AND DETERMINE TATTOO OF THE DAY.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.343
- WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE
AS MANY POTENTIAL WINNERS

32:50.426 --> 32:51.344
AS I WAS HOPING.

32:51.427 --> 32:54.639
CLEEN, BEAUTIFUL TATTOO,
GREAT EXECUTION.

32:54.722 --> 32:57.684
JASON HIT THE MARK
ON THE COMPOSITION, APPLICATION,

32:57.767 --> 32:58.810
AND THE GEISHA.

32:58.893 --> 33:01.354
- HANDS DOWN FOR ME,
JASON TOOK THIS ONE.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.231
- OLIVER, FINAL DECISION?

33:03.314 --> 33:03.981
- I'M GOING WITH JASON.

33:04.065 --> 33:07.276
- I'M GOING WITH CLEEN.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.697
- JASON.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.366
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE BEST TATTOO

33:13.449 --> 33:15.368
OF THE DAY GOES TO JASON.

33:15.451 --> 33:16.577
- YEAH.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.620
[cheers and applause]

33:17.704 --> 33:19.455
FINALLY.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.581
FINALLY, FINALLY.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.624
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.209
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.713
- ONE OF YOU WILL BE
PACKING YOUR MACHINES TODAY.

33:26.796 --> 33:29.173
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

33:29.257 --> 33:33.052
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.345
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

33:34.429 --> 33:37.390
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.439
- I THINK WE'RE GOING DOWN, SO--

33:44.522 --> 33:46.899
- WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS, MAN.

33:46.983 --> 33:50.445
- [chuckles]
THAT'S--DAMN, MAN.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.363
I'D RATHER FEEL GOOD
BEATING OUT SOMEBODY THAT HAS

33:52.447 --> 33:57.368
THAT COMPETITIVE SPIRIT THAN
BEATING OUT A [bleep] PUSSY.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.786
I'M HERE FOR A REASON.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.954
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR REASON IS,

34:00.037 --> 34:01.789
BUT I KNOW
WHAT THE [bleep] I'M HERE TO DO,

34:01.873 --> 34:03.207
AND THAT'S TO WIN THIS.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.001
I'M HERE TO BEAT YOU.
I'M HERE TO BEAT YOU.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.961
I'M HERE TO BEAT THEM,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

34:07.044 --> 34:10.130
YOU JUST GOT ME [bleep] PISSED
BY MAKING THAT [bleep] MOVE.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.299
- I'M NOT READY
TO GO HOME, MAN.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.800
- YOU GOT TO BE
[bleep] KIDDING ME, MAN.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.302
- WELL, I DO WANT TO BE HERE.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.971
- YOU DID IT TO YOURSELF.
- IT'S WHATEVER, MAN.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.598
- STOP BEING A PUSSY, MAN.
- YEAH.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.099
- FACE ME.
- I'M WAITING TO FACE YOU.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.309
THAT'S WHAT
I [bleep] WISH WE HAD.

34:21.391 --> 34:22.560
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO IT FOR LONG.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.436
- BUT I DIDN'T DO A BAD TATTOO,
EXACTLY.

34:23.518 --> 34:24.437
- IT DOESN'T [bleep] MATTER

34:24.520 --> 34:26.522
WHAT KIND OF [bleep] TATTOO
YOU DID.

34:26.606 --> 34:27.190
- WHO DID THEY SAY THAT WAS
A BAD TATTOO EACH CHALLENGE?

34:27.273 --> 34:28.940
THEY SAID YOU WERE.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.650
- AND NOW I'M MAKING
MY ADJUSTMENTS.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.069
I DIDN'T SAY
I WAS GONNA GIVE UP.

34:32.152 --> 34:33.154
I DIDN'T [bleep] SAY,
"OH, WHATEVER. WHATEVER.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.406
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA COP OUT."

34:35.489 --> 34:37.408
I'M NOT COPPING OUT.
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.201
I INTEND TO [bleep] WIN.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.827
I CAME HERE WITH A THIRST, MAN,

34:39.911 --> 34:41.161
AND I INTEND TO QUENCH IT.

34:41.245 --> 34:46.083
IF YOU'RE MY COMPETITOR,
BRO, GIVE ME A FIGHT.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.842
- TODAY WE'RE TESTING
COMPOSITION

34:55.927 --> 34:57.512
WITH JAPANESE GEISHAS.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.055
LET'S START OFF WITH DON.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.556
- WE ALL KNOW GEISHA'S FACES

35:00.640 --> 35:02.683
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LIGHTER
THAN THE REST OF THEIR BODY.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.852
HE JUST RUINED IT WITH THIS
DARK, HEAVY, SCRATCHY SHADING.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.147
- SHE'S JUST NOT SEXY.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.690
- CRIS?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.359
THIS ONE'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO READ.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.486
- THE BACKGROUND,
THE ROBE, THE FISH,

35:13.569 --> 35:15.863
THE SKIN TONE,
AND THE HAIR--ALL DARK.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.365
IT'S JUST A MESS.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.200
- WHEN WE GAVE CRIS
HIS CRITIQUE,

35:19.283 --> 35:20.660
HE SAID HE GAVE UP BEFORE HE--

35:20.743 --> 35:21.953
- HE SAID, "I JUST GAVE UP
BEFORE I EVEN GOT STARTED."

35:22.036 --> 35:23.037
- WE'VE HAD THIS EXCHANGE
WITH HIM

35:23.120 --> 35:24.622
WHERE HE'S TIRED
OR HE LOSES FOCUS.

35:24.705 --> 35:27.208
WHETHER THE OTHER TATTOOERS
ARE DOING GOOD TATTOOS OR NOT,

35:27.291 --> 35:28.584
THEY'RE KILLING THEMSELVES
TO BE IN THE ROOM.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.086
AND FOR THIS KID
TO TAKE THAT APPROACH,

35:30.169 --> 35:32.088
IT'S A WASTE OF OUR TIME.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.714
- WE HAVE MARK LONGENECKER.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.299
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE,

35:35.383 --> 35:37.510
BUT IT DID NOT SCREAM GEISHA
TO ME.

35:37.593 --> 35:38.719
- SHE LOOKS BEAT.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.763
THIS IS ONE
OF OUR MORE EXPERIENCED ARTISTS,

35:40.847 --> 35:42.557
AND THIS IS VERY HIGH
IN THE RUNNING

35:42.640 --> 35:44.100
FOR WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.768
- LET'S TALK ABOUT TIM.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.813
- IT'S JUST A FACE, A FAN,
AND A WEIRD BLUE SHAPE.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.481
HE HAD GOOD REFERENCE.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.441
- IF YOU CANNOT TAKE
WHAT'S ON A PAPER

35:52.525 --> 35:54.652
AND JUST TRACE IT,
THEN YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.737
THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL GET
IF YOU HAVE AN ARTIST

35:56.821 --> 35:59.407
THAT CAN'T TRANSLATE
FROM ONE PAGE TO THE NEXT,

35:59.490 --> 36:00.408
TO THE STENCIL TO THE SKIN.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.660
- THE INTERESTING THING
ABOUT THIS IS

36:02.743 --> 36:05.246
THAT THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS GONNA PICK ONE TATTOO

36:05.329 --> 36:07.582
OUT OF THIS BUNCH THAT THEY
THINK IS THE WORST OF THE DAY.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.500
- THERE'S MORE THAN A FEW
TO CHOOSE FROM.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.294
- ARE WE UNIFIED ON A DECISION
HERE?

36:11.377 --> 36:13.713
- I'M IN.

36:13.796 --> 36:17.425
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAS THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.093
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:19.176 --> 36:20.761
I HAD MARK AS MY ARTIST.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.388
- THE DRESS,
I THINK IT'S A MESS.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.640
I THINK IT'S MUDDY.
THERE'S TOO MANY DARKS IN THERE.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.392
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S FLOATING.

36:26.475 --> 36:27.476
THERE'S NO FEET.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.561
- WE DIDN'T WANT
THERE TO BE FEET.

36:28.644 --> 36:30.229
IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK FLOWY.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.607
- I FEEL IF YOU'RE, LIKE, GOING
FOR, LIKE, A GHOSTLIKE GEISHA,

36:32.690 --> 36:33.691
THAT WOULD, LIKE, BE ON POINT.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.943
[laughter]

36:36.027 --> 36:37.028
- THIS WAS MY TATTOO.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.113
MY ARTIST WAS EMILY.
I LOVE THE FAN.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.616
I LOVE THE BLUE WITH THE GRAY.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.742
- THE LINE WORK IS OFF.

36:42.825 --> 36:45.119
THERE'S JUST NO DETAIL.
IT'S JUST--

36:45.202 --> 36:46.579
- IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
SHE HAS TWO ELBOWS.

36:46.662 --> 36:49.540
- THERE'S NO SEPARATION
BETWEEN HER FACE AND HER ARM.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.917
IT'S ALL THE SAME COLOR.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.211
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.505
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.
MY ARTIST WAS CRIS.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.965
I DON'T BELIEVE
IT SHOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.467
THE LINE WORK'S GOOD.
IT FLOWS.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.011
- THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOUR FISH,

37:02.094 --> 37:04.055
YOUR FLOWERS ON THE KIMONO,
AND YOUR FACE.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.848
IT'S ALL JUST ONE COLOR.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.476
- YOU HAVE TO DEEPLY LOOK AT IT
TO REALLY DIFFERENTIATE THINGS.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.561
THAT'S WHERE IT DIFFERS
FROM EMILY'S TATTOO.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.565
- EMILY'S TATTOO, YOU COULD SEE
FROM 6 FEET AWAY WHAT THAT IS.

37:14.649 --> 37:18.486
IF YOU LOOK AT CRIS'S, IT'S
GONNA LOOK LIKE A GRAY MASS.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.655
- DO WE HAVE A DECISION?
all: YES.

37:27.912 --> 37:33.584
- THE JUDGES WANT TO SEE
MARK, TIM, AND CRIS.

37:33.668 --> 37:38.172
WE'LL SEE YOU AND YOUR RIVALS
DOWNSTAIRS.

37:38.255 --> 37:41.008
- WOW, CRIS, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT, DUDE,

37:41.092 --> 37:41.759
THAT YOU WANT TO BE HERE, MAN.

37:41.842 --> 37:45.054
- THIS IS IT.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.980
- TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW COMPOSITION

37:54.063 --> 37:55.856
BY TATTOOING A JAPANESE GEISHA.

37:55.940 --> 38:00.027
MARK, CRIS, AND TIM,

38:00.111 --> 38:04.782
ANY ONE OF YOU
COULD JUSTIFIABLY BE ELIMINATED.

38:04.865 --> 38:08.369
CRIS, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:08.452 --> 38:10.788
DETERMINED
THAT YOU HAD THE WORST TATTOO

38:10.871 --> 38:13.541
OF THE DAY.

38:13.624 --> 38:16.168
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY,

38:16.252 --> 38:18.713
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT IT WAS MY BEST WORK.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.007
- THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS TATTOO
IN THE LAYMAN'S EYES IS,

38:21.090 --> 38:22.008
IT LOOKS LIKE A MESS.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.551
IF THAT BACKGROUND
AND THOSE FISH

38:23.634 --> 38:24.802
WERE LIGHTER AND STOOD OUT
FROM THAT GEISHA GIRL,

38:24.885 --> 38:26.804
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT
IT WAS THE WORST.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.556
- I DON'T WANT THIS
TO REPRESENT MY WORK.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.725
AND MY DUMB, IDIOTIC COMMENT
THAT I MADE--

38:30.808 --> 38:33.310
I AM TRULY SORRY,
AND I APOLOGIZE.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.479
- I THINK YOUR FELLOW
COMPETITORS TOOK OFFENSE TO IT

38:35.563 --> 38:37.648
'CAUSE THEY ALL ARE STRUGGLING
AND FIGHTING TO BE HERE.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.608
- I WANT TO BE
IN THIS COMPETITION.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.235
I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO,

38:41.318 --> 38:43.946
AND I INTEND TO KEEP ON SHOWING
YOU GUYS WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.658
- SERIOUSLY,
YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.368
- TIM.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.038
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE
SOMETHING FROM A REFERENCE

38:52.121 --> 38:53.122
TO A FINAL DRAWING.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.041
- I FELL A LITTLE SHORT
ON MY DESIGN, MAN,

38:55.124 --> 38:57.626
BUT I THINK MY TECHNICAL SKILLS
ARE STILL THERE.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.336
- EVERY TIME
YOU GUYS COME OUT HERE,

38:59.420 --> 39:01.422
WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT WHOSE
TATTOO'S BETTER THAN WHOSE,

39:01.505 --> 39:02.548
WHO'S AT THE TOP
AND WHO'S AT THE BOTTOM.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.468
SO IT'S EITHER HERE OR HERE,
AND--

39:05.551 --> 39:06.635
- AND I UNDERSTAND
WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.095
- YEAH, MAN.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.263
- BUT I STILL GOT A LOT MORE
TO SHOW AND A LOT MORE TO DO.

39:09.346 --> 39:10.806
- YOU'RE FIGHTING
FOR YOUR LIFE OUT HERE.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.809
- I UNDERSTAND.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.019
- MARK.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.103
- THIS TATTOO IS ROUGH.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.731
BLOWOUTS, CHEWED UP SKIN.

39:18.814 --> 39:21.776
WHEN WE SEE TOO MUCH TRAUMA
TO THE TATTOO, IT'S A BAD SIGN.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.944
- IT'S NOT MY SHINING MOMENT
IN MY TATTOO CAREER.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.238
I HAVE GOOD FIGHT IN ME.

39:26.322 --> 39:27.948
THERE'S GONNA BE NEW MARK
IN THAT SHOP.

39:28.032 --> 39:28.532
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.121
- ALL THE YOGA
AND ALL THE MEDITATION

39:34.205 --> 39:36.082
OF TAKING YOURSELF
OUT OF THE MOMENT,

39:36.165 --> 39:37.333
MAYBE YOU GOT TO BE
IN THE MOMENT.

39:37.416 --> 39:40.169
- STRAIGHT UP.
