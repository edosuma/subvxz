01:56.049 --> 01:58.383
- Come on, let's go!

02:18.105 --> 02:19.738
You okay?

02:48.168 --> 02:51.603
<i>We must
be set to face a long war</i>

02:51.605 --> 02:55.340
<i>against crafty
and powerful bandits.</i>

02:55.342 --> 02:59.912
<i>The attack at Pearl harbor
can be repeated</i>

02:59.914 --> 03:01.947
<i>at any one of many points,</i>

03:01.949 --> 03:04.917
<i>in both oceans
and along both our coastlines</i>

03:04.919 --> 03:09.955
<i>and against
all the rest of the hemisphere.</i>

03:09.957 --> 03:14.626
<i>It will not only be a long war,
it will be a hard war.</i>

03:14.628 --> 03:18.096
<i>We expect to eliminate
the danger from Japan,</i>

03:18.098 --> 03:22.968
<i>but it would serve us ill
if we accomplished that</i>

03:22.970 --> 03:27.172
<i>and found that the rest
of the world was dominated</i>

03:27.174 --> 03:29.641
<i>by Hitler and Mussolini.</i>

03:30.643 --> 03:33.645
<i>We are going to win this war</i>

03:33.647 --> 03:38.116
<i>and we are going to win
the peace that follows.</i>

03:38.118 --> 03:42.421
- Is it a letter from home?
- Yep, from my brother, homer.

03:44.824 --> 03:48.193
- It's the youngest one, right?
- Uh, no, no.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.162
Youngest one's Ulysses.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.264
He's, um...

03:52.266 --> 03:54.633
Well, he's four.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.973
<i>He believes nothing good
ever ends.</i>

04:00.975 --> 04:03.742
<i>And he's under the impression
that he belongs</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:05.944
<i>wherever there's something
interesting to see.</i>

04:12.518 --> 04:14.519
<i>I have this idea
that you'll come to ithaca</i>

04:14.521 --> 04:16.021
<i>and meet him one day.</i>

04:16.023 --> 04:18.690
<i>And my brother homer,</i>

04:18.692 --> 04:22.227
<i>my sister Bess... and ma.</i>

05:07.106 --> 05:09.207
- Hiya, Harry!

05:19.286 --> 05:21.853
- Fourteen words, collect.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.425
You're a little short.
- A little.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.094
I got drafted.
- Drafted, I see.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.129
- My mother'll send me
enough money to get home.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.597
- Uh-huh.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.933
- Do you know how long
it'll take the telegram

05:34.935 --> 05:36.368
to get to her?

05:41.574 --> 05:43.075
What's that?

05:43.077 --> 05:44.876
Why...? What's this?

05:44.878 --> 05:48.113
- Just go ahead. It's nothing.
Don't worry about it. Just...

05:48.115 --> 05:49.881
- Wh-why? What's...

05:49.883 --> 05:52.150
- you pay me back when
your mother sends the money.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.618
- Thanks.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.658
- Send it paid, Willie!

06:01.627 --> 06:03.929
- Tom...

06:03.931 --> 06:05.964
- What?

06:05.966 --> 06:09.634
I know, Willie. It's just...
Every once in a while.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.907
So remind me, why do you want
to be a messenger?

06:15.909 --> 06:18.643
- Because I'll get to visit
a lot of people

06:18.645 --> 06:21.980
and go to a lot of places.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.750
- Oh. And, uh,
how did you sleep last night?

06:24.752 --> 06:26.651
D'you nod off today at school?

06:26.653 --> 06:29.654
- A little.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.823
- What about sports?

06:31.825 --> 06:34.292
What about missing out on them
on account of having this job?

06:34.294 --> 06:37.929
- We have a physical-education
period every day.

06:37.931 --> 06:42.501
- Is that so? Well, I used
to run the 220 low hurdles

06:42.503 --> 06:44.503
when I went to Ithaca high.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.539
I was, uh...
I was the valley champion.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.010
I was val...

06:53.679 --> 06:57.349
So tell me,
you really want this job?

06:57.351 --> 07:00.185
- I'm gonna be the best
messenger this office ever had.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.722
- I was the best messenger this
office ever had, so you're on.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.124
Okay, the faster
you deliver messages,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.859
the more you can deliver.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.195
The faster you pick up
outgoing messages,

07:10.197 --> 07:12.397
the more we can send.
The more we can send,

07:12.399 --> 07:14.699
the better our chances
of beating western union

07:14.701 --> 07:17.169
and staying alive.
We're postal telegraph.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.404
We get there swiftly.
We're polite to everyone.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.473
We take off our hats
in elevators and,

07:21.475 --> 07:22.774
above all things,

07:22.776 --> 07:26.044
we never lose a telegram.
- Yes, sir.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.150
- How old are you?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.585
- Sixteen.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.187
- Yeah, that's
what you said yesterday.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.456
We're not allowed
to hire a boy unless he's 16.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.691
How old are you?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.093
- Fourteen.

07:43.429 --> 07:46.264
- Well, so you'll be 16
in two years.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.100
What are you gonna do
with the $15 a week?

07:49.102 --> 07:52.404
- Give it to my mother.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.840
- Alright, from here on out,
you're part of this outfit.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.508
You watch everything,
you listen closely,

07:56.510 --> 07:58.577
you keep your eyes open
and your ears peeled.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.178
You got me? This here,

08:00.180 --> 08:01.947
this is what we call a quarter.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.915
You're gonna take it
to Chatterton's bakery

08:03.917 --> 08:07.452
and bring me back two day-old
pies: Apple and coconut-cream.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.920
- Yes, sir.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.926
- What do you think of him?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.995
- He's a good boy.
- I think he is.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.931
A couple of years underage,
that's all.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.300
- Well, I'm a couple of years
overage,

08:22.302 --> 08:24.202
so I think we'll get along.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.105
- If you need me,
I'll be at Corbett's.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.808
You two can share
those pies between you.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.212
What's your name again?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.648
- Homer Macauley.
- Homer Macauley.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.116
You're just the boy
this office needs.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.985
I reckon you're the
fastest-moving thing

08:39.986 --> 08:41.919
in this valley.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.123
Remember, once a messenger,
always a messenger.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.799
- Alright, boy, alright.

08:59.338 --> 09:01.139
Homer Macauley.

09:02.441 --> 09:05.911
My name is William Grogan.
I'm 67 years old.

09:05.913 --> 09:09.347
Old-time telegrapher,
one of the last.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.049
And I'm hungry.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.921
And from now on,
you and I are friends.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.692
Mm.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.997
Here you go.

09:25.999 --> 09:30.602
I may, on occasion,
ask you to run me an errand.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.671
In the event of drunkenness,

09:32.673 --> 09:35.173
I shall expect a depth
of understanding.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.442
- I've got a pretty good
understanding.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.312
- Do you? We'll see.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.184
Every evening...

09:46.186 --> 09:50.021
I'll count on you to see that
I'm able to perform my duties.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.691
A splash of cold water
directly on the face

09:52.693 --> 09:55.193
if I don't respond when shaken

09:55.195 --> 09:59.664
and to be followed immediately
by a cup of hot black coffee

09:59.666 --> 10:01.132
from Corbett's across the road.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.867
You know where Corbett's is?
- Yes, sir.

10:02.869 --> 10:03.935
Cold water, hot coffee.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.037
- Excuse me.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.291
Homer...

10:26.293 --> 10:30.095
Do you think that this world
is gonna be a better place

10:30.097 --> 10:31.863
after the war?

10:34.433 --> 10:35.433
- Yes, sir.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.606
- How do you like
that coconut-cream pie?

10:41.608 --> 10:43.308
- Very good, sir.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.282
- Homer...

11:27.119 --> 11:29.821
This is your first telegram.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.297
Put it in your cap.

12:39.191 --> 12:42.327
- Postal telegram.
- You have a telegram?

12:42.329 --> 12:44.729
- Yes, ma'am.
- For who is it?

12:44.731 --> 12:47.632
- A Mrs. Rosa Sandoval,
1129 G street.

12:47.634 --> 12:51.536
Are you Mrs. Sandoval?
- <i>Sí, sí, sí.</i> Please come in.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.546
I cannot read English.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.550
How does the telegram read?
- Ma'am?

13:05.552 --> 13:09.053
- Please, open the telegram
and read to me the telegram.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.557
- Yes, ma'am.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.937
- Please, come inside.

13:49.662 --> 13:54.265
Who sends me this telegram?
My son, Juan Domingo?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.103
- No, ma'am.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.106
It's, uh...

14:02.942 --> 14:05.043
From the secretary of war.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.781
- The secretary...
- Maybe it's a mistake.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.717
Maybe it wasn't your son.
Maybe it was somebody else.

14:12.719 --> 14:16.054
The telegram says
it was Juan Domingo, but...

14:16.056 --> 14:19.123
Maybe the telegram's wrong.
- Please, sit down.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.125
I will bring you some candy,
okay?

14:21.127 --> 14:23.394
All boys love candy very much.

15:29.361 --> 15:33.531
- I can't quit. Otherwise,
I'm as good as dead myself.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.406
Mr. Grogan!

15:43.409 --> 15:44.809
Mr. Grogan.

15:51.550 --> 15:55.987
Mr. Grogan, there's a telegram!
They're calling you! Wake up!

15:57.523 --> 15:59.090
- Ah!

16:06.231 --> 16:08.399
Coffee. Corbett's!

16:17.743 --> 16:20.478
- Mr. Corbett, I need
a cup of coffee right now.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.647
It's for Mr. Grogan.
- Sure.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.464
No, it's alright.
No charge, boy.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.265
- Thanks.

16:45.070 --> 16:49.540
- That's right, that's right,
that's right! Don't be afraid.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.110
That's exactly right.
That's what I told you.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.012
It's exactly right.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.447
Corbett's coffee.

17:02.621 --> 17:06.824
- Is it... an important
telegram?

17:06.826 --> 17:09.093
- No.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.462
It's most unimportant.

17:12.798 --> 17:16.134
Ah, the accumulation of money,
business.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.435
Seeing it takes a few weeks

17:18.438 --> 17:20.405
for the important ones
to get here.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.806
It's a night letter,

17:21.808 --> 17:24.142
but you won't have
to deliver it tonight.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.310
It's most unimportant.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.512
But very important
for me to receive it.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.651
They wanna... replace me.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.154
They've been wanting
to retire me for years,

17:36.156 --> 17:38.823
bring in machines, teletypes.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.526
Machines instead
of human beings.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.327
- Yes, sir.

17:46.665 --> 17:51.536
- I knew I could count on you,
homer. I just knew it.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.539
You've already been
a great help to me.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.140
You know...

17:56.142 --> 17:59.177
You've come to work
just in time.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.353
I used to be the fastest
telegrapher in the world.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.856
Faster than Wolinsky.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.526
Sending, receiving,
receiving, sending...

18:15.528 --> 18:19.163
And no mistakes. No mistakes!

18:19.165 --> 18:20.565
Yeah.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.200
Willie Grogan.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.168
Everybody in the world,

18:24.170 --> 18:27.538
every operator in the world
knew that...

18:27.540 --> 18:33.177
Knew that name.
And I... pfft. Well...

18:34.379 --> 18:39.383
You and me, homer,
we're still alive.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.554
We are.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.727
Mm. Ah...

18:51.363 --> 18:53.731
<i>I should like to say just a word</i>

18:53.733 --> 18:55.399
<i>to the women in the country
tonight.</i>

18:55.401 --> 18:58.035
<i>I have a boy at sea
on a destroyer.</i>

18:58.037 --> 19:01.572
<i>For all I know, he may be
on his way to the pacific.</i>

19:01.574 --> 19:05.743
<i>Two of my children are
in coast cities on the pacific.</i>

19:05.745 --> 19:08.045
<i>Many of you
all over this country</i>

19:08.047 --> 19:10.982
<i>have boys in the services
who will now be called upon</i>

19:10.984 --> 19:12.750
<i>to go into action.</i>

19:12.752 --> 19:16.954
<i>You have friends and families
in what has suddenly become</i>

19:16.956 --> 19:18.589
<i>a danger zone.</i>

19:18.591 --> 19:20.758
- Everything's alright, ma.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.327
I don't want you to sit up
this way. Everything's alright.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.308
I had to deliver a telegram...

19:37.310 --> 19:41.279
To a lady over on G street.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.214
It said her son's dead.

19:46.151 --> 19:47.752
She wouldn't believe it.

19:51.456 --> 19:55.159
And when I got back
to the office,

19:55.161 --> 19:58.629
the old telegraph
operator was drunk.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.966
He has to do his work,
or they'll put him on a pension.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.642
- Everything's alright, homer.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.978
It's only that you are becoming
aware

20:13.980 --> 20:16.280
of a world
in which you've been a child.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.988
- I don't know what's happening.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.492
Or why.

20:30.529 --> 20:33.664
But no matter what...

20:33.666 --> 20:36.334
I won't let anything hurt you
that way.

20:44.677 --> 20:49.013
<i>- Dear homer, you are now
the man of the Macauley family.</i>

20:49.015 --> 20:52.683
<i>So everything I have at home
is yours.</i>

20:52.685 --> 20:56.821
<i>My books, my phonograph,
my microscope.</i>

20:58.357 --> 21:00.524
<i>I miss you, of course,</i>

21:00.526 --> 21:03.527
<i>and I think about you
all the time.</i>

21:03.529 --> 21:07.064
<i>I think about our father,
who died so recently</i>

21:07.066 --> 21:09.066
<i>and yet so long ago.</i>

21:09.068 --> 21:12.370
<i>His goodness... somehow...</i>

21:12.372 --> 21:14.038
<i>Still with us.</i>

21:23.082 --> 21:25.049
- Ah, knock it off.

21:25.051 --> 21:28.586
<i>- His death is not an easy
thing to understand.</i>

21:31.089 --> 21:33.557
<i>I guess it just takes time.</i>

21:35.927 --> 21:37.561
<i>Time to let it go.</i>

21:40.066 --> 21:41.799
<i>And when the pain leaves...</i>

21:41.801 --> 21:46.804
<i>I hope the rest will be lighter
and better than ever.</i>

21:50.742 --> 21:52.476
<i>We leave for action soon.</i>

21:52.478 --> 21:54.945
<i>No one knows where that may be.</i>

21:56.581 --> 21:58.215
<i>I'm happy.</i>

21:58.217 --> 22:02.219
<i>And even though
I wish there were no war...</i>

22:02.221 --> 22:05.289
<i>I'm happy
to be serving my country,</i>

22:05.291 --> 22:08.092
<i>which, to me, is Ithaca.</i>

22:10.128 --> 22:11.762
- Marcus.

22:11.764 --> 22:15.366
So what are... so what
are mornings like back home?

22:16.802 --> 22:18.135
- Mornings?

22:55.173 --> 22:56.674
- What's that?

22:59.478 --> 23:03.481
- Exercises.
- What for?

23:03.483 --> 23:04.849
- Muscle.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.917
- Gonna be the strongest man
in the world.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.121
- No.
- What are you gonna be, then?

23:10.123 --> 23:11.989
- Go back to sleep.

23:19.765 --> 23:23.601
- Gonna go to school?
- Yep.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.836
- Gonna learn something?

23:25.838 --> 23:28.005
- I'm gonna run the
220 low hurdles someday.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.673
- Why?

23:29.675 --> 23:33.043
- Because everybody born in this
town wins the 220 low hurdles.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.178
Marcus did,

23:34.180 --> 23:37.248
the manager
of the telegraph office did

23:37.250 --> 23:39.850
when he went to Ithaca high.
He was valley champion.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.052
- What's valley champion?

23:42.054 --> 23:45.356
- That's the best.
- Gonna be the best?

23:45.358 --> 23:48.025
- I'm gonna try.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.113
Tomorrow... no, yesterday
I saw the train.

23:55.138 --> 23:56.200
How'd it go?

23:56.202 --> 24:00.704
- The Bachmann waved.
- Did you wave back?

24:00.706 --> 24:04.341
- He said, "going home."
Where's he going?

24:04.343 --> 24:07.912
- I don't know. Everybody's got
a different home.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.481
- Are you going?
- Someday.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.785
- Gonna come back?
- Sure.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.755
- Gonna be glad?
- Sure. Gonna be glad to see ma,

24:17.757 --> 24:21.559
Marcus and Bess,
glad to see you.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.061
- Don't go, homer, don't go.

24:26.064 --> 24:29.567
- I'm not going now.
I'm just going to school.

24:29.569 --> 24:32.903
- Papa went and he won't come
back, not like he used to.

24:32.905 --> 24:38.209
Marcus went...
Don't you go too, homer.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.580
- It's gonna be a long time
before I go.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.115
But, for now,
it's time for you to go.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.584
- Where?

24:46.586 --> 24:48.819
- Back to sleep.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.941
Ah!!

25:21.953 --> 25:24.288
<i>I have no idea what's ahead.</i>

25:24.290 --> 25:28.792
<i>But whatever it is,
I am humbly ready for it.</i>

25:51.149 --> 25:54.018
<i>- Marcus.</i>

25:54.020 --> 25:55.986
<i>Marcus.</i>

25:57.289 --> 26:00.624
Marcus. Marcus!

26:00.626 --> 26:03.761
<i>My friend here is an orphan.</i>

26:03.763 --> 26:06.664
<i>His name is Toby George.</i>

26:06.666 --> 26:08.832
<i>I've told him
all about our family</i>

26:08.834 --> 26:10.935
<i>and someday I'll bring him home.</i>

26:16.341 --> 26:18.976
<i>I would rather
I wasn't in the army</i>

26:18.978 --> 26:20.678
<i>and there was no war.</i>

26:20.680 --> 26:23.280
<i>I don't hate anyone.</i>

26:25.016 --> 26:27.017
<i>But I've long since made up
my mind</i>

26:27.019 --> 26:29.853
<i>to be the best soldier I can be.</i>

26:45.370 --> 26:48.572
<i>More than anything else in
the world, I wanna come home.</i>

26:48.574 --> 26:54.211
<i>And spend many long years with
you, ma and Bess and Ulysses.</i>

26:56.047 --> 26:59.483
<i>I wanna come back for a home
and a family of my own.</i>

27:27.912 --> 27:30.214
<i>You are now on your way,</i>

27:30.216 --> 27:32.750
<i>in a world chockfull of things
that...</i>

27:32.752 --> 27:35.386
<i>Aren't easy to understand.</i>

27:35.388 --> 27:38.489
<i>So, of course,
all the mistakes are ahead.</i>

27:38.491 --> 27:41.792
<i>All the wonderful mistakes
that you must,</i>

27:41.794 --> 27:43.961
<i>and will make.</i>

27:54.272 --> 27:57.641
<i>Trust your heart,
which is a good one,</i>

27:57.643 --> 28:00.678
<i>to be right, and go ahead.</i>

28:02.313 --> 28:04.782
- Set!

28:12.957 --> 28:14.925
No! Get off the field!

28:20.165 --> 28:21.465
- Ugh!

28:29.174 --> 28:33.677
<i>- And if you fall, tricked
or tripped by others,</i>

28:33.679 --> 28:35.813
<i>or yourself even...</i>

28:35.815 --> 28:37.981
<i>Get up.</i>

28:39.784 --> 28:42.820
- Dinner with... well...
No, now wait a minute.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.988
I promised?

28:44.990 --> 28:46.990
When did I promise to have
dinner with your parents?

28:46.992 --> 28:48.826
- <i>Come on, you remember.</i>
- Uh-huh.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.627
<i>- We talked about it
at breakfast.</i>

28:50.629 --> 28:54.531
<i>You remember, right, darling?</i>
- Okay, take it easy. Every...

28:54.533 --> 28:57.468
Every time you call me darling,
it make me wanna...

28:57.470 --> 28:59.336
- <i>what are you afraid of?</i>
- Yeah, no...

28:59.338 --> 29:01.939
- <i>dinner is at 7:00 sharp.</i>
- 7:00 sharp.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.207
<i>- You know how...</i>

29:03.209 --> 29:05.175
- what do you mean
by sharp exactly?

29:05.177 --> 29:07.344
<i>- You're a diamond!
Wear something right.</i>

29:07.346 --> 29:09.646
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>You know, evening clothes.</i>

29:09.648 --> 29:10.981
- What do you mean,
evening clothes?

29:10.983 --> 29:12.983
I wear the same clothes
morning and evening Bo...

29:12.985 --> 29:15.285
- <i>the clothes I got you.</i>
- No, no, alright.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.387
<i>- I love you.</i>

29:20.760 --> 29:22.860
<i>And I know you love me, too.</i>

29:22.862 --> 29:24.962
- Yes, I do.

29:24.964 --> 29:27.197
Okay. No. Goodbye.

29:32.370 --> 29:36.206
I have been out to dinner
two times in my life and...

29:36.208 --> 29:38.742
I was scared to death
both times.

29:38.744 --> 29:40.644
I had no fun at all.

29:40.646 --> 29:44.748
- Mr. Spangler,
I'm sorry I'm running late.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.216
- Hi, homer.
- Hey, homer.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.418
- Ulysses,
what are you doing here?

29:48.420 --> 29:51.088
- Oh... Ulysses, huh?
That makes sense.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.223
This little fella, he just
walks in right off the street,

29:53.225 --> 29:55.559
plops himself down,
listens to my phone calls.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.861
Fearless, that's what you are.
You are a fearless young man

29:57.863 --> 29:59.129
and you're an excellent
listener, too.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.497
What is happening?

30:00.499 --> 30:03.066
Are you limping over there?
Are you okay?

30:03.068 --> 30:04.868
- Yes, sir.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.805
- Okay, then. A few telegrams
have piled up and a few pickups.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.106
You do the pickups first,

30:09.108 --> 30:10.707
then deliver the telegrams
afterwards.

30:10.709 --> 30:14.444
- Yes, sir, right away.
I'm awfully sorry I'm late.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.413
- Ah, that's alright.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.453
Don't worry, we'll keep
an eye on your brother for you.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.888
You just... you go ahead.

30:26.925 --> 30:29.092
- Yeah, you go ahead, homer.

30:32.730 --> 30:36.834
- Willie, I'm going over
to Corbett's for a drink.

30:36.836 --> 30:41.438
I am having dinner tonight
with Diana and her parents,

30:41.440 --> 30:46.276
and I feel the need
for a little... fortification.

30:46.278 --> 30:49.847
- Well, Ulysses and me can hold
down the fort while you're gone.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.482
Can we? You think? Yep.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.352
Get the good wine
ready for pickup.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.121
- Oh, when homer comes back,
you two keep him here

30:58.123 --> 31:00.290
until sunripe growers calls
for their pickup.

31:00.292 --> 31:03.327
Listen, your brother has beaten
western union to sunripe growers

31:03.329 --> 31:05.329
twice in the last two days.
How many'd he get yesterday?

31:05.331 --> 31:08.465
- Uh... 67.
- Sixty-seven.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.501
He beats them again, we might
have a good month after all.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.203
I'll be back. One drink.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.472
- Oh, that's sunripe now,
ready for pickup.

31:17.475 --> 31:20.210
- I'll do the pickup, Willie.
How do you like that?

31:20.212 --> 31:21.478
- You?

31:21.480 --> 31:24.147
- Yes, me. If homer can beat
western union, so can I.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.450
And I'm gonna do it on foot!
- Hmm.

31:27.986 --> 31:31.521
- Sam. Hannah.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.495
Hi, boys!

31:49.173 --> 31:52.542
You! Are the loveliest woman
in the world.

32:05.790 --> 32:08.058
Heya, Harry.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.360
Postal telegraph! Stan.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.364
- What on earth?

32:14.366 --> 32:17.367
- Once a messenger, always
a messenger, Mrs. Brockington.

32:17.369 --> 32:20.537
- I declare, you're never gonna
grow up, tom Spangler.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.206
- Hope not.
- Beaten again, Harry.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.208
- Ah, poor Harry.

32:25.210 --> 32:29.579
- Here it is, 129 night letters,
all paid.

32:29.581 --> 32:33.317
- Oh! Thank you.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.921
Here you go, Harry. Hate for you
to go back to western union

32:37.923 --> 32:39.389
with nothing to send.

32:46.998 --> 32:50.067
How is it, Ralph?

32:50.069 --> 32:53.236
- Oh, not bad, not good.

32:53.238 --> 32:55.238
- Not bad, not good.

32:57.942 --> 33:00.410
I buy them three to their one.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.412
When they're broke
and ready to go,

33:02.414 --> 33:04.815
I'll give them their money back.
- You afford that?

33:04.817 --> 33:06.583
- No.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.589
- Ah, something eatin' you,
Ralph?

33:15.293 --> 33:17.060
- Maybe.

33:21.966 --> 33:23.667
You know old Dutch here...

33:23.669 --> 33:26.937
Would've been 45 years old
today.

33:26.939 --> 33:29.339
Can you imagine that?
- Is that so?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.541
- Hey. Hey, screwball, give us
another couple of drinks.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.444
- We're just catching up.
He'll be right with you, friend.

33:36.114 --> 33:38.281
- The war to end wars, right,
tom?

33:38.283 --> 33:40.817
- That's what they told us.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.619
That's what they said.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.990
- Hey, pal, I asked you
for a couple of drinks.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.158
- Yeah.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.694
- What are you gonna do
about it?

33:52.463 --> 33:54.631
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey!

33:54.633 --> 33:56.600
- Do you know
who you're talking to?

33:56.602 --> 33:58.635
- Ralphie.
- I didn't mean nothin' by it.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.937
- You got no idea.
- It's okay.

34:00.939 --> 34:04.007
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.609
Just... like you were.
As you were.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.644
- You go on, miss.
- It's gonna be fine.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.846
- You don't wanna be
with this guy.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.481
- Here, here.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.819
Good luck, soldier.

34:20.458 --> 34:24.161
Come on, it's alright, pal.
- No, it ain't.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.196
I'm scared, tom.

34:27.498 --> 34:31.501
- Well, nowadays...
We're all scared.

34:33.838 --> 34:37.674
Uh... Diana, she...
She's getting impatient.

34:37.676 --> 34:41.678
She's having me have dinner
tonight with her parents.

34:42.513 --> 34:43.780
You wanna talk about scared.

34:47.685 --> 34:51.054
- I didn't think it'd ever
happen again, tom.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.755
But no wonder, huh?

34:54.891 --> 34:57.227
The fightin's... inside us.

34:58.729 --> 35:00.530
It's inside of me.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.569
It's what we are.
Till we ain't.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.558
- Can I have another?

35:34.765 --> 35:36.399
Gentlemen...

35:38.936 --> 35:40.337
- You got sunripe, Mr. Spangler?

35:40.339 --> 35:43.106
- I surely did.
129, give or take a handful.

35:43.108 --> 35:45.642
- How'd you get there first?
- I ran!

35:45.644 --> 35:47.878
- You beat western union
to sunripe running?

35:47.880 --> 35:49.579
- Nothing to it.

35:49.581 --> 35:53.717
- Yeah, it's a shame that
you got lost on the way back.

35:53.719 --> 35:56.052
- What do you say you take
Ulysses here on home now?

35:57.422 --> 36:00.223
- We got a pickup
from Guggenheim's.

36:00.225 --> 36:02.759
That's down our way,
so I'll hike Ulysses home,

36:02.761 --> 36:06.363
go to Guggenheim's,
then Ithaca wine, then Foley's.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.132
Come on.
I'll be back in no time.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.934
- I know you will.

36:13.638 --> 36:14.938
- Bye-bye.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.729
- It's just thunder.
That doesn't scare you, right?

36:39.731 --> 36:43.833
- No, nothing scares me.
Go faster, homer.

36:52.310 --> 36:54.578
<i>Pay attention, homer.</i>

36:54.580 --> 37:00.517
<i>Look around at this wonderful,
senseless yet beautiful world.</i>

37:01.819 --> 37:04.988
<i>And feel compassion
for all things.</i>

37:08.659 --> 37:12.662
<i>And their terrible way
of enduring... and dying.</i>

37:15.199 --> 37:18.001
<i>Helpless...</i>

37:18.003 --> 37:21.238
<i>And full of the world to come.</i>

37:30.348 --> 37:32.015
- Guess we're on our way.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.517
Scuttlebutt's we leave
first thing in the morning.

37:34.519 --> 37:37.520
- Yeah?
What do you think about, Toby?

37:37.522 --> 37:39.889
What... what do you wanna
go back to?

37:39.891 --> 37:41.358
- Uh, anything... I guess.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.793
I don't have a girl like Mary
waiting for me,

37:43.795 --> 37:44.894
sister like Bess.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.696
Hell, I didn't even know
kids had parents

37:46.698 --> 37:49.232
till I went to school and
heard the kids talk about them.

37:49.234 --> 37:50.700
So whatever I go back to,

37:50.702 --> 37:54.037
it'll be a place,
but it won't be people.

37:54.039 --> 37:58.708
I'd like to think that I could
go back to Ithaca with you.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.379
- You will.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.381
- What do you think about?

38:06.250 --> 38:08.051
- I think about my father.

38:09.553 --> 38:12.255
- Matthew Macauley.
- Yeah. That's right.

38:12.257 --> 38:16.893
- Yes.
- Uh, he worked in the orchards.

38:16.895 --> 38:20.563
Just... plain, ordinary,
everyday work.

38:20.565 --> 38:23.099
Never made any more money
than we needed.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.134
Ever.

38:24.136 --> 38:27.270
But he did save enough money

38:27.272 --> 38:29.406
to make a down payment
on a piano.

38:29.408 --> 38:32.075
My mother wanted that for Bess.

38:34.745 --> 38:37.447
There are still men in the world
like that, Toby.

38:40.284 --> 38:41.751
- Tell me about Bess.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.421
- You wanna know about Bess?

38:44.423 --> 38:47.924
You are in luck.
- Got a picture in your pocket?

38:47.926 --> 38:49.893
- Yeah, I'm my pocket.

39:02.306 --> 39:04.774
- Hi, Bess.
- Hello, Mr. Grogan.

39:04.776 --> 39:08.144
- A little wet, huh?
- This is my friend Mary.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.447
- Pleased to meet you, Mary.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.415
- We're just on our way
to the majestic.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.951
And here's homer's supper.
- We're going to the pictures.

39:14.953 --> 39:19.322
- Oh. I'll see he gets it.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.459
- Oh. Uh... hello.
- Hello.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.327
- Hello.
- Uh, ma'am.

39:24.329 --> 39:25.462
- Hi!

39:25.464 --> 39:27.063
- May I help you gentlemen?

39:27.065 --> 39:30.867
- Uh, yeah, um... how much is
a telegram to New Jersey?

39:30.869 --> 39:34.070
- Well, it's 25 words
for 50 cents,

39:34.072 --> 39:36.005
plus a small tax and...

39:36.007 --> 39:39.342
We don't count the address
or the signature.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.344
- Alright, 50 cents,
that's not bad.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.813
Uh, how much to San Antonio?

39:43.815 --> 39:47.083
- Uh, half as much as, uh,
Jersey.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.818
- That makes a lot of sense.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.987
- So half of 50 cents,
that would make it...

39:50.989 --> 39:52.355
- A quarter.
- 25 cents.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.656
- Thank you.
- Alright, great.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.892
- Here you go, sir.
Ooh, there it is.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.293
- Huh?

39:57.295 --> 39:59.996
- You're gonna have to pardon
my, uh, pal fat here.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.499
He's just, uh, he's just
homesick something awful.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.667
- It's not my name, no.
- Dude.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.136
- You see, ma'am,

40:06.138 --> 40:09.172
fat here and I, we're shipping
out tomorrow

40:09.174 --> 40:11.841
and he's just a little nervous,
that's all.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.544
- It's not my name. At all.
- Box.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.380
Box? B-o-c... b-o-c-k-s?

40:17.382 --> 40:19.048
- Uh, yeah, c-k-s.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.151
- Of... of dried figs.

40:21.153 --> 40:23.386
Dried figs.

40:23.388 --> 40:24.888
- Yes, f-i-g-g-s.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.790
- We were gonna go
to the picture show

40:26.792 --> 40:29.259
and we were wondering if-if...

40:29.261 --> 40:31.394
Well, if you wanted...

40:31.396 --> 40:33.997
If you wanted to maybe come
with... if you wanted to come.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.498
- Yeah, there's gonna be
a cartoon, I hear.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.133
The cartoon's my favorite part.
- Sure.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.202
- You would? We're going
to the pictures with 'em.

40:39.204 --> 40:43.072
- Okay, hold on just one second.
- Don't worry about nothing.

40:43.074 --> 40:44.307
- Love, Bernard.

40:44.309 --> 40:45.942
- You're done. After you.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.479
- I got it. I'll get the door.
- I'll get the door!

40:53.051 --> 40:54.918
<i>The greatest
double-cross in history.</i>

40:54.920 --> 40:57.086
<i>Jap envoys talk peace
in Washington.</i>

40:57.088 --> 41:00.223
<i>Jap planes, without warning,
bring war to America.</i>

41:00.225 --> 41:03.259
<i>Our great pacific outpost
in the Hawaiian islands</i>

41:03.261 --> 41:05.361
<i>is ruthlessly bombed</i>

41:05.363 --> 41:07.330
<i>as Japan's perfidious
declaration of war.</i>

41:07.332 --> 41:10.867
<i>Death and destruction unleashed
on a nation at peace.</i>

41:10.869 --> 41:12.469
<i>On that fateful Sunday morning,</i>

41:12.471 --> 41:15.405
<i>when this country was
extending a friendly hand</i>

41:15.407 --> 41:16.706
<i>of conciliation and peace.</i>

41:16.708 --> 41:19.042
<i>A nation,</i>

41:19.044 --> 41:23.913
<i>like a person,
has something deeper,</i>

41:23.915 --> 41:26.249
<i>something more permanent,</i>

41:26.251 --> 41:32.922
<i>something larger than
the sum of all its parts.</i>

41:32.924 --> 41:38.761
<i>It is that something which
matters most to its future.</i>

41:47.605 --> 41:50.106
- It's yours.
- Huh?

41:51.575 --> 41:53.977
- Here, take it.

43:16.026 --> 43:18.861
- Your sister Bess brought
your supper by.

43:25.035 --> 43:27.737
She was with a girl,
a very pretty girl.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.209
- Is it an important telegram?

43:42.419 --> 43:44.754
That's Mary, our neighbor.

43:45.589 --> 43:47.790
She's Marcus's girl.

44:06.243 --> 44:09.412
I was gonna get us two pies,
but there's plenty here.

44:11.281 --> 44:12.915
Will you share with me?

44:12.917 --> 44:15.418
- Oh, no, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

44:17.921 --> 44:20.523
- Maybe if you...

44:20.525 --> 44:23.259
Started to eat a little,
your appetite will improve.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.629
- Yeah.

44:26.631 --> 44:29.932
We... we do have raincoats,
you know.

44:32.302 --> 44:33.436
- Yeah.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.806
I know.

44:38.108 --> 44:41.477
I just...
Got caught in the rain.

44:48.285 --> 44:52.822
They don't just... die
for nothing, do they?

44:57.961 --> 45:00.363
- Well, I can't answer
that question, son.

45:04.301 --> 45:07.470
I'm not sure
there is an answer to that.

45:11.141 --> 45:14.477
It's a very young question.
I'm an old man.

45:19.316 --> 45:22.485
Just try not to live in fear,
homer.

45:35.165 --> 45:38.835
Would you run upstairs
and get my pills for me?

45:38.837 --> 45:40.937
- Yes, sir.

46:12.203 --> 46:15.404
- Ah, thank you, boy. Thank you.

46:15.406 --> 46:17.306
- Yes, sir.

48:34.311 --> 48:36.212
- Wait!

48:37.180 --> 48:39.382
What's the matter?

48:39.384 --> 48:41.817
- I'm sorry.

48:41.819 --> 48:46.022
I've got a telegram
for Mrs. Claudia Beaufrere.

48:46.024 --> 48:49.191
- Of course you do.
It's her birthday.

48:49.193 --> 48:52.929
Mother!
There's a telegram for you.

48:52.931 --> 48:55.197
It's from Alan, I'm sure.

48:55.199 --> 48:57.366
Come in, young man.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.208
Just a moment.

49:25.762 --> 49:28.431
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

49:28.433 --> 49:30.766
- May I offer you some punch?
- No, thanks.

49:30.768 --> 49:34.036
- Wait right here, I'll just go
get my change purse.

49:34.038 --> 49:35.571
- There's no need.

49:46.451 --> 49:48.250
I'll just...

49:49.953 --> 49:52.755
I have to go back now...
To the office.

49:54.624 --> 49:56.325
- Please...

49:56.327 --> 49:57.994
Wait.

50:19.116 --> 50:20.783
- Mother!

50:33.031 --> 50:37.299
- Thanks. Thank you.

50:37.301 --> 50:40.302
- So, uh... did you like it?
- Yeah, it was great.

50:40.304 --> 50:43.305
- It was good, it was good.
- The cartoon was great.

50:43.307 --> 50:45.841
- Yeah.
- Well, we need to go home now.

50:45.843 --> 50:49.979
- Oh... well, uh... thank you.

50:49.981 --> 50:52.048
- For what?

50:53.016 --> 50:54.817
- I'm very fond of you.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.198
- Think I could steal one too?

51:09.200 --> 51:11.667
I'm shipping out tomorrow,
as well.

51:22.045 --> 51:24.346
<i>Try to remember...</i>

51:24.348 --> 51:27.249
<i>That none of us
is separate from each other.</i>

51:28.552 --> 51:30.219
<i>He is ours.</i>

51:31.188 --> 51:34.090
<i>And we... are his.</i>

51:34.092 --> 51:35.691
- Come on, Bess.

51:40.997 --> 51:43.365
- Bye.
- Whoo-wee!

51:43.367 --> 51:48.571
- How you talk, boy!
- Oh man! Oh, man!

51:51.742 --> 51:53.576
- Smooth! Silky smooth.

51:55.212 --> 51:57.546
- Hoo!
- Ah.

52:01.719 --> 52:04.386
<i>The world's gone mad, homer.</i>

52:53.737 --> 52:56.438
- What's the matter
with your leg, boy?

52:57.774 --> 53:01.443
- It's nothin'. I guess I...

53:01.445 --> 53:04.613
...twisted a ligament
or something.

53:04.615 --> 53:07.283
I was running
the 220 low hurdles.

53:07.285 --> 53:09.952
- Hmm.
- And, uh...

53:12.155 --> 53:14.823
...it's all confused.

53:14.825 --> 53:16.825
Everything's...

53:16.827 --> 53:18.561
Changed out there.

53:18.563 --> 53:23.632
I guess I'll rub some liniment
on it tonight or something.

53:23.634 --> 53:26.802
- Yeah, that might be good.

53:29.172 --> 53:31.807
You've changed, you know.

53:31.809 --> 53:35.911
In the week or so you came
to work, you've changed.

53:39.182 --> 53:40.649
- Yeah.

53:44.988 --> 53:49.325
I didn't know anything
before I got this job.

53:49.327 --> 53:52.461
I don't like the way things are.

53:52.463 --> 53:55.664
I just want things to be better.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.935
How can any man
ever get it all straight

53:59.937 --> 54:03.005
so that it comes out even
and makes sense?

54:04.341 --> 54:06.508
Everything's so...

54:06.510 --> 54:09.311
Sad or mixed up...

54:09.313 --> 54:10.980
And wrong.

54:12.282 --> 54:13.882
And...

54:13.884 --> 54:16.752
I don't even care if Helen Eliot
doesn't like me anymore.

54:16.754 --> 54:19.822
Sure, I wish she... would,
but if she doesn't, that's okay.

54:22.359 --> 54:24.860
Yeah, something's the matter
with it.

54:34.904 --> 54:36.872
It's five after 12.

54:38.742 --> 54:41.410
I guess I'll go home now.

54:44.914 --> 54:46.715
Tomorrow's Saturday.

54:48.885 --> 54:52.054
Saturdays used
to be my best day.

54:56.393 --> 54:59.728
You sure you wouldn't like
a sandwich now?

54:59.730 --> 55:02.097
- Yeah, I'll have a sandwich.

55:02.099 --> 55:03.899
Changed my mind.

55:05.735 --> 55:09.571
Please...
Thank your mother for me.

55:09.573 --> 55:11.807
- Nah, it's nothing.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.409
- No!

55:13.411 --> 55:15.244
It's somethin'.

55:15.246 --> 55:17.446
Thank her.
Please thank her for me.

55:17.448 --> 55:19.214
- Yes, sir.

55:19.216 --> 55:21.517
- You do love me, don't you?

55:21.519 --> 55:23.485
I know that you do.

55:23.487 --> 55:26.755
You do love me, don't you?
I know that you do.

55:28.658 --> 55:31.994
What do you think about...
What do you think about a woman

55:31.996 --> 55:35.064
who says to you:
"You do love me, don't you?

55:35.066 --> 55:37.099
I know that you do."

55:40.771 --> 55:44.073
- That you'd be a fool
to let her get away.

55:48.111 --> 55:51.113
- What do you think
of that new messenger?

55:56.786 --> 55:59.121
- He's the best I ever seen.

56:37.827 --> 56:42.030
- Stop! Wait! Don't go!
Don't go there!

56:42.032 --> 56:44.166
Leave them alone!

56:44.168 --> 56:46.368
Dad!

56:46.370 --> 56:49.671
Don't go!

56:49.673 --> 56:52.174
We will sing one song.

56:53.877 --> 56:55.577
- No!!

56:55.579 --> 56:58.514
- Homer. Alright, lie down.

56:58.516 --> 57:00.749
- Oh...
- Oh...

57:02.318 --> 57:04.820
It's alright.

57:08.526 --> 57:11.693
He's alright, Ulysses.
Go back to sleep.

58:07.083 --> 58:08.817
- It's Marcus.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.115
- Ma?

58:43.152 --> 58:45.787
Ma?
- Yes, homer.

58:45.789 --> 58:48.023
- I never cried
when I was little.

58:49.893 --> 58:51.994
Even Ulysses never cries.

58:52.929 --> 58:55.864
Because, well, what's the use?

58:58.234 --> 59:03.438
I thought a fellow would never
cry when he got to be grown up.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.174
'Cause that's when you start
finding out about things.

59:08.978 --> 59:12.681
- There will always be pain
in this world, homer.

59:14.317 --> 59:18.987
And a good man will seek
to take the pain out of things.

59:18.989 --> 59:21.523
- Mrs. Macauley,
Ulysses and me have already been

59:21.525 --> 59:23.158
to Mr. Henderson's tree

59:23.160 --> 59:25.394
with Auggie, Enoch, Shag,
Nickie and Alf,

59:25.396 --> 59:27.162
but the apples aren't ripe.

59:27.164 --> 59:30.532
- Well of course they're not,
Lionel. They need more time.

59:30.534 --> 59:32.634
- Well,
they're gonna play football now,

59:32.636 --> 59:35.304
and Ulysses's too small,
and Ulysses and me,

59:35.306 --> 59:37.739
we're partners
and I wanna ask permission

59:37.741 --> 59:40.208
to take Ulysses
to the public library.

59:40.210 --> 59:42.010
- You have my permission.

59:48.284 --> 59:51.019
- Was Marcus like Ulysses
when he was little?

59:51.021 --> 59:53.188
- In what way?

59:54.223 --> 59:55.824
- Fearless.

59:55.826 --> 59:58.393
- Well,
Ulysses is like his father.

59:58.395 --> 01:00:00.696
Except...

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:03.699
No one is fearless.

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.302
- I wish I could be
like Ulysses.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.419
You know, ma, you're just about
the most wonderful person

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:25.988
anyone could ever know.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:30.225
There goes Auggie.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.095
Another touchdown.

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.871
I'm gonna go
to the telegraph office.

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:46.241
I told them I'd come,
just in case they needed me.

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:51.046
Oh, and Mr. Grogan,
he ate one of the sandwiches.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:52.781
He told me
to tell you thank you.

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:55.884
So thanks, ma, from Mr. Grogan.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.457
- Katie.

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.963
Katie?

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.278
- Yes, Matthew?

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:15.197
- Katie.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:21.503
- Yes.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.525
- Marcus?

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.230
Marcus?

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:50.532
You okay?

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.036
- Yeah.

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.743
- So, uh...

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.545
So, Ulysses...

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:05.113
What's he like?

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:09.751
- Let me tell you about him.

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.236
- Hi, homer!

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:31.072
Homer's going to work.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.443
Homer's going to work!

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.410
: Okay, in a minute!

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:45.013
Saved by the bell.

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:50.118
- So, uh... thank you, Lily,

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.520
and... I'll be seeing you.

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:54.122
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:59.127
- Telegram for Dolly Hawthorne?

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:01.696
- Oh, she's out. I can take it.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:04.032
Hold on a minute, will you?

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:13.241
Boy, would you come here
a minute, please?

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.715
Oh. Would you mail this letter
for me?

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:23.952
It's very important.
It's my sister.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:25.987
Send it air mail,

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:27.789
special delivery, registered.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:31.526
There's money in it.
Um... I haven't got any stamps.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:34.029
Would you do this for me?

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.197
- Yes, ma'am.
- Here is a dollar.

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:37.832
Put the letter in your hat,

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:41.236
don't let anybody see it,
and don't tell anybody.

01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:43.972
- I won't tell anybody.
I'll do it right now.

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:45.573
I'll bring you your change.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.208
- No!

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.711
Don't come back here.

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:10.532
- No, it can't be.

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:13.168
It's a machine!

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:15.704
- I don't think so, Auggie.
- I don't know.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:19.107
- No, Auggie's right.
It's a machine. I'm telling you.

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.376
- Ah, lookit!

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:33.621
- It's a man.
- Oh, what do you know, Lionel?

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.463
: Marcus?

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:28.276
- You okay?
Come on, Ulysses,

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.711
let's go home.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.414
We've seen him
go through all the cards.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.718
I'm going, Ulysses.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.273
- Papa, mama!

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.344
Ma!

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.352
- He got lost, ma.

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:14.823
Auggie found him and brought him
to the telegraph office.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.794
- Thanks, homer.

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:23.231
- Careful, there's a busted egg
in his pocket.

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:43.451
<i>Homer.</i>

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.920
<i>I've never believed in wars.</i>

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.890
<i>I know them to be foolish,
even when they're necessary.</i>

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:52.894
<i>I'm glad that I'm the Macauley
who is in this war,</i>

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:57.332
<i>for it'd be a pity
and a mistake if it were you.</i>

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:02.569
<i>I can write to you what I would
never say in person.</i>

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:06.006
<i>You are the best
of the Macauleys.</i>

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:08.376
<i>You must go on being the best.</i>

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:15.416
<i>You must live in the years
of your life forever.</i>

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.519
<i>You are
what we are fighting for.</i>

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:23.524
<i>Yes, you, my brother.</i>

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:30.131
- "Now I'll write your name here
to remind you, homer Macauley,

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.933
"that's who you are.

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:35.435
"I miss you very much.

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:38.273
"I can't wait
until I see you again.

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.943
"God bless you.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:45.613
"So long, your brother,

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.448
Marcus."

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.529
If my brother...

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:05.366
Is killed in this stupid war,

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:07.335
I'll spit at the world.

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:09.170
I'll hate it forever.
I won't be good.

01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:12.473
I'll be the worst of them all,
the worst that's ever lived.

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:14.375
- Uh, you be grateful
for yourself.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.977
You... be thankful.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.546
That's what your brother's
trying to tell you.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:21.282
- Mr. Grogan, are you drunk?

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:26.754
- Yeah... I'm a little drunk.
I feel better when I'm drunk.

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:29.324
I probably wouldn't be telling
you the things I'm telling you

01:10:29.326 --> 01:10:31.125
if I wasn't drunk!

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:32.827
You're a man, homer!

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.663
Fourteen years old
and you're a man!

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:38.800
Now who knows who made you
such a thing.

01:10:38.802 --> 01:10:43.438
I don't know, you don't know.
But it's true!

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.040
Know that it's true!

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:47.675
You understand me?

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:25.079
- Hello, Lionel.
Going to see the movie?

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:27.849
- Haven't got any money.
- Why are you standing in line?

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:30.051
- Me, Auggie, Enoch, Shag,
Nickie and Alf

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:33.288
went out to the jailhouse
to talk to the criminals,

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.691
but then Shag chased me away.
I don't know where to go.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.860
- Well, do you wanna see
the movie?

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:40.561
- No.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.265
- Come on with us.
We're only taking a walk around.

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:45.767
The sun's going down.

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:48.436
- Come on with us, Lionel.
- Okay.

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:53.741
Thanks. I sure was getting
tired standing there.

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.610
Stop it, Ulysses!

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:31.813
- Hey, come on now.
- Stop it!

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:33.715
- I'm gonna say hello
to Mr. Grogan.

01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:36.451
I'll catch up.
- Homer?

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:57.038
- It's me, Mr. Grogan.
I'll hurry and get the coffee.

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.642
Coffee!

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:04.078
- Oh, I'm cooking a new pot
right now, homer.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.881
It'll be just a minute.
- You don't have any?

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:16.424
- There'll be coffee
in a minute.

01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:18.526
Mr. Corbett's making a...

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:22.997
Mr. Grogan?

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:26.834
What's the matter?

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:51.192
- What's the matter, homer?
What's wrong with the old man?

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:54.395
- He's dead.
- Oh, you're crazy.

01:13:54.397 --> 01:13:55.863
- No.

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.201
He's dead.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.709
- Auggie?

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:10.611
- Uh, it's Mr. Grogan.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.880
Homer says he's dead.

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:38.072
- I'll stop that.

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.578
Auggie?

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.147
Um, I want you to go over
to Corbett's.

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:21.949
Alright?

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:24.752
Um, you have them telephone...

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.555
...dr. Nelson.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:32.093
His number's 1133.
He'll take care of everything.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:34.161
Okay, have him come
right on over here,

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:36.264
and then also have him telephone
Harry Burke.

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:38.099
He's the other
telegraph operator.

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:41.502
And you have them both
come down here, okay?

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:43.304
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Auggie.

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:00.047
: Hi, homer.

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:09.390
- Willie always said he wanted
to work until the day he died.

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:13.861
You gotta believe your brother
isn't gone,

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:15.796
he's still inside you,
he's inside...

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:19.066
- no! That isn't good enough!

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.236
I want to see him!

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.805
I wanna smell him.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.907
I wanna hear his voice,

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:30.077
hear him laughing
and have fights with him!

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:32.647
Everything's different now.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.084
And this place...

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:39.620
Everything in Ithaca
has changed,

01:17:39.622 --> 01:17:44.825
because my brother isn't gonna
look at anything anymore!

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:51.298
My brother's dead.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.101
- Right, okay.

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:57.238
I'm not... I'm not gonna try
and comfort you.

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:02.977
I can't.

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.351
But just try to believe...

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:15.956
...that the best part
of a good man stays.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:22.196
It stays forever.

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:43.184
- They'll know.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.322
They'll know
the minute they see me.

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:52.159
- Well, I can sit with you
for while, if you like.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:19:00.000
- I have to go now.

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.222
- Ma, somebody's...

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:32.092
There's a soldier outside.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:40.434
Well, go on out to him, honey.

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.111
- Hello.

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.315
- Bess?

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:57.384
- How do you know my name?

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:05.926
Do you know my brother Marcus?

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.730
- Yes.

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:12.299
- Has he come home with you?

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.469
- Your brother...

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:44.164
- You're Toby, aren't you?

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:53.207
It came this afternoon.

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:55.175
- I'm sorry, homer.
