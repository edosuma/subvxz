00:08.250 --> 00:09.834
- And according

00:08.250 --> 00:09.834
to city officials,

00:09.875 --> 00:11.792
this mistake at Swellview Prison

00:11.834 --> 00:15.709
is the biggest mistake in the

00:11.834 --> 00:15.709
history of prison mistakes.

00:16.792 --> 00:18.375
- Wow. So disturbing.

00:18.417 --> 00:20.208
And now we go live,

00:18.417 --> 00:20.208
to Swellview Prison

00:20.250 --> 00:24.041
with reporter,

00:20.250 --> 00:24.041
Barney Villaraigosa.

00:24.083 --> 00:24.959
- You want some soup?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.834
- You don't share soup.

00:26.875 --> 00:28.875
- I share soup with my mom.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.542
- Do I look like your mom?

00:31.583 --> 00:33.166
- I wish.

00:34.417 --> 00:35.834
- I'm here outside

00:34.417 --> 00:35.834
Swellview Prison

00:35.875 --> 00:36.834
with Mark Landry,

00:36.875 --> 00:38.583
from the prison parole board.

00:38.625 --> 00:39.333
Mr. Landry...

00:39.375 --> 00:41.041
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:41.667 --> 00:45.250
- How could you have

00:41.667 --> 00:45.250
accidentally released

00:45.291 --> 00:49.458
one of the F .B.I .'s most

00:45.291 --> 00:49.458
dangerous criminals by mistake?

00:49.500 --> 00:50.667
- Yeah um, see,

00:50.709 --> 00:52.250
today is bring your

00:50.709 --> 00:52.250
daughter to work day,

00:52.291 --> 00:55.083
and my daughter Molly was

00:52.291 --> 00:55.083
playing with my computer,

00:55.125 --> 00:57.917
and somehow she

00:55.125 --> 00:57.917
released Drex from...

00:57.959 --> 00:58.959
heh prison, heh.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.375
Again, I'm so sorry.

01:01.709 --> 01:03.750
- Molly, why would

01:01.709 --> 01:03.750
you release Drex,

01:03.792 --> 01:05.834
knowing how dangerous he is?

01:05.875 --> 01:07.875
- I'm five.

01:07.917 --> 01:09.834
- [ laughs ]

01:09.875 --> 01:12.000
- Ahhh, kids sure do say

01:09.875 --> 01:12.000
the stupidest things.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.875
- Uh, Barney...any news

01:13.291 --> 01:15.875
on the current location

01:15.917 --> 01:17.875
of this criminal named Drex?

01:17.917 --> 01:19.000
- Not at this time.

01:19.041 --> 01:19.792
But investigators are using

01:19.834 --> 01:21.583
all available resources

01:21.625 --> 01:24.208
to conduct a complete search

01:21.625 --> 01:24.208
of literally everywhere.

01:27.041 --> 01:29.041
- Charlotte, I need

01:27.041 --> 01:29.041
you to log into

01:29.083 --> 01:31.125
the Man Copter's computer

01:29.083 --> 01:31.125
guidance system.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.458
- Ooo, you're taking

01:31.166 --> 01:32.458
the Man Copter?

01:32.500 --> 01:33.959
- I don't have time

01:32.500 --> 01:33.959
for questions.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.041
- Where are you going?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.041
- To catch Drex.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.250
- You answered her question.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.834
- What?

01:39.250 --> 01:40.834
- You said,

01:40.875 --> 01:42.083
you don't have time

01:40.875 --> 01:42.083
for questions,

01:42.125 --> 01:45.125
but I guess that only

01:42.125 --> 01:45.125
applies to my questions.

01:45.166 --> 01:47.125
- Hey, thanks for understanding.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.291
- Okay, I'm logged into

01:52.458 --> 01:54.291
the Man Copter's computer.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.667
- Good. Set all weapons

01:54.333 --> 01:56.667
to ready position,

01:56.709 --> 01:58.583
locked and loaded.

01:58.625 --> 01:59.959
- Locking...

02:00.000 --> 02:01.625
and loading.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
- All right, I'm outta here.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
- Hang on!

02:05.041 --> 02:06.125
- What? I gotta go!

02:06.166 --> 02:07.291
- But don't you wanna

02:06.166 --> 02:07.291
wait for Henry?

02:07.333 --> 02:08.375
- Yeah. Henry's not here.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.625
- Do you want me

02:08.417 --> 02:09.625
to text him

02:09.667 --> 02:11.166
and find out how far he is?

02:11.208 --> 02:12.417
- Uh...No! No...no-no.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.959
- Uh, Why not?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.125
- Uh...

02:15.166 --> 02:16.959
'Cuz I already

02:15.166 --> 02:16.959

02:17.000 --> 02:19.500

02:17.000 --> 02:19.500
gonna meet me there, so.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.750

02:20.458 --> 02:21.750
- Hey look!

02:21.792 --> 02:23.125
That's Henry calling

02:21.792 --> 02:23.125

02:23.166 --> 02:24.834
Hi Henry.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.041

02:24.875 --> 02:27.041

02:27.083 --> 02:28.750

02:29.917 --> 02:31.417
Uh...sorry Henry--

03:08.542 --> 03:10.000
Hello? Oh, hey Schwoz.

03:10.041 --> 03:11.250

03:11.291 --> 03:12.250

03:12.291 --> 03:14.417

03:14.458 --> 03:15.625
- Ah, what's that

03:14.458 --> 03:15.625

03:15.667 --> 03:17.417
Oh, I should leave

03:15.667 --> 03:17.417
the Man Cave right now?

03:17.458 --> 03:18.834
And Henry, Charlotte, and Jasper

03:18.875 --> 03:19.709
should stay here

03:19.750 --> 03:21.000
and not ask me any questions?

03:21.041 --> 03:22.125
Good! Good idea!

03:22.166 --> 03:23.458
- Here! I got it! Here it is!

03:23.500 --> 03:24.834
- Alright--rrrrr...

03:24.875 --> 03:25.917

03:27.583 --> 03:29.959

03:30.000 --> 03:31.208
Winkler.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.834
Bleggghhhh.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.500
- Hey, I thought you said

03:35.125 --> 03:37.500
you were going to leave

03:37.542 --> 03:38.583
before Henry got here.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.291
- D'oh, can you be quiet...

03:40.333 --> 03:41.417
ever?!?

03:41.458 --> 03:45.000
- Ray, what's goin' on here?

03:41.458 --> 03:45.000
- Yeah...

03:45.041 --> 03:46.166
- Uh...

03:45.041 --> 03:46.166
- Dude,

03:46.208 --> 03:47.458
if there's somethin' goin' on,

03:47.500 --> 03:48.709
tell me--I'm your sidekick.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.709
- Wait, I'm confused.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.000
I thought your plan was

03:50.750 --> 03:53.000
to go fight that guy, Drex,

03:53.041 --> 03:54.166
but not tell Henry

03:54.208 --> 03:55.542
so that Henry would

03:54.208 --> 03:55.542
never know about it.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.291
- Oh! And that's it.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.917
C'mere...

03:56.333 --> 03:58.917
- Baaaaahhh!

03:59.875 --> 04:01.000
- Until you learn

03:59.875 --> 04:01.000
to hold still!

04:01.041 --> 04:02.750
- Oh, no, no, no, Ray.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.750
Not the pineapple.

04:02.792 --> 04:04.667
- Not the pineapple!

04:04.709 --> 04:05.917
- Quiet!

04:08.625 --> 04:09.917
- Okay. You kids have fun.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.166
- I should be back

04:09.959 --> 04:11.166
around dinner time.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.208
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

04:13.250 --> 04:15.542
Talk to me.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.333
- Look Kid...

04:18.375 --> 04:20.166
I gotta go fight

04:18.375 --> 04:20.166
a really bad guy, Drex.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.709
And I gotta

04:20.458 --> 04:22.709
fight him alone.

04:26.041 --> 04:27.041
- Well, why?

04:27.083 --> 04:27.792
- 'Cuz I know Drex.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.542
He's extremely dangerous.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.917
He's...he's bad

04:29.583 --> 04:31.917
on a whole other level.

04:32.792 --> 04:34.250
- Well, how do you know him?

04:34.291 --> 04:35.917
- I'm sorry, what?

04:36.917 --> 04:38.875
- How do you know

04:36.917 --> 04:38.875
this guy, Drex?

04:39.458 --> 04:40.375
- Oh. ah, uh, just from...

04:40.417 --> 04:42.542
Y'know...from stuff.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.291
- From stuff?

04:42.583 --> 04:43.291
- Mmhm.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.667
- Blah!

04:49.291 --> 04:50.750
- Why don't you just tell Henry

04:50.792 --> 04:52.875
that Drex used to be

04:50.792 --> 04:52.875
your sidekick?

04:54.041 --> 04:55.917
- Schwoz!

05:00.250 --> 05:02.458
- You had a sidekick...

05:02.500 --> 05:04.000
before me?

05:04.041 --> 05:05.250
- Uh...

05:07.125 --> 05:09.125
Hell--

05:09.166 --> 05:11.375
Oh heyyyyyyyy.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.709
- It all just kinda happened.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.625
I wanted an after-school job.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.333
But then,

05:15.667 --> 05:17.333
an indestructible superhero

05:17.375 --> 05:18.291
hired me to be his sidekick.

05:18.333 --> 05:19.291
- Ah!

05:19.333 --> 05:21.500
- Now we blow bubbles...

05:21.542 --> 05:22.542
and fight crime.

05:21.542 --> 05:22.542
- Feels good!

05:22.583 --> 05:24.625
[ music ]

05:36.875 --> 05:38.542
- Call it.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.542
- Up the tube!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.875
- Aw, my boot!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.875
- Ha!

05:48.125 --> 05:50.792
- I...I can't believe this.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.875
I cannot believe this.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.333
- Oh, you say that every week.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.750
I don't know. I just...

05:55.375 --> 05:56.750
I always thought

05:56.792 --> 05:57.750
that I was your first sidekick.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.250
- Well...

05:59.291 --> 06:00.959
- You really had

05:59.291 --> 06:00.959
a sidekick before me?

06:01.917 --> 06:02.834
And you never told me?

06:02.875 --> 06:04.417
- Well, no--

06:04.458 --> 06:07.083
but only 'cuz I didn't

06:04.458 --> 06:07.083
want you to know.

06:08.208 --> 06:09.542
- Hey hey, something's happening

06:09.583 --> 06:10.792
upstairs in Junk-N-Stuff.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.834
- Hello? Hello?

06:14.834 --> 06:16.625
Where you go?

06:16.667 --> 06:19.750
I need my change!

06:19.792 --> 06:20.875
- Jasper, why aren't

06:19.792 --> 06:20.875
you up there?

06:20.917 --> 06:22.917
- What--I was.

06:22.959 --> 06:25.000
But I came down here to

06:22.959 --> 06:25.000
get change for a $20

06:25.041 --> 06:26.625
and then I got distracted.

06:26.667 --> 06:27.583
- That was 45 minutes ago!

06:27.625 --> 06:29.166
- What the?

06:27.625 --> 06:29.166
- Dang it, Jasper!

06:29.208 --> 06:30.750
- Go do your job!

06:29.208 --> 06:30.750
- Get up there!

06:30.792 --> 06:32.458
- Fine.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.458
- Come on man.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.208
- Son...

06:33.250 --> 06:35.166
gimme the proton grenade.

06:37.750 --> 06:38.709
- But it's so cool!

06:38.750 --> 06:40.500
- Son!

06:40.542 --> 06:41.125
- Fine.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.291
- D'ah!

06:41.166 --> 06:43.291
- Ah!

06:44.792 --> 06:48.000
HENRY: So...

06:49.000 --> 06:51.583
This bad guy, Drex...

06:52.959 --> 06:54.542
He was your sidekick?

06:54.917 --> 06:57.333
- Yes, for a little while.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.583
Look, I hired Drex like

06:57.375 --> 06:59.583
nine years ago...

06:59.625 --> 07:01.458
it was before I even

06:59.625 --> 07:01.458
had this Man Cave.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.166
Why'd you hire such a bad guy

07:01.500 --> 07:04.166
to be your sidekick?

07:04.208 --> 07:07.709
- Because he seemed

07:04.208 --> 07:07.709
perfect at the time.

07:08.625 --> 07:10.000
- Well...

07:10.041 --> 07:11.834
Well why?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.041
I mean what...

07:13.083 --> 07:14.583
what made him so perfect?

07:16.041 --> 07:18.709
- Drex had it all.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.083
- Ray!

07:23.125 --> 07:24.583
- Well...not as hot as yours.

07:24.625 --> 07:25.709
- Ray!

07:27.125 --> 07:28.834
- So, why wasn't Drex

07:27.125 --> 07:28.834
the perfect sidekick?

07:28.875 --> 07:31.041
- Uh, well,

07:31.083 --> 07:33.000
I found that Drex...

07:33.041 --> 07:34.625
he has a dark side.

07:35.917 --> 07:36.917
- Dark how?

07:36.959 --> 07:39.959

07:43.875 --> 07:46.875
and he was violent, cruel,

07:43.875 --> 07:46.875
and dangerous.

07:46.917 --> 07:49.375
And one day, Drex and I...

07:49.417 --> 07:51.000
[ sighs ] we just had it out.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.875
- You guys fought?

07:52.917 --> 07:53.875
- Oh yeah.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.750
- It was horrible.

07:55.792 --> 07:59.709
- But, I mean,

07:55.792 --> 07:59.709
you won...right?

08:00.959 --> 08:01.792
- Barely.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.166
- Barely?

08:03.208 --> 08:04.125
But you're like,

08:03.208 --> 08:04.125
the best fighter

08:04.166 --> 08:05.667
in the whole world.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.917
- Oh nooooo.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.500
Not better than Drex.

08:09.542 --> 08:10.917
If I wasn't indestructible,

08:10.959 --> 08:12.917
believe me, I'd have been,

08:12.959 --> 08:14.458
y'know...destructed.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.917
- I just can't believe I'm not

08:15.458 --> 08:17.917
your first sidekick.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.709
- Hey...

08:19.750 --> 08:22.375
you're my first sidekick

08:19.750 --> 08:22.375

08:23.375 --> 08:25.834
- Oh! Sure.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.834
Did you tell Drex that, too?

08:25.875 --> 08:26.750
- Noooo.

08:26.792 --> 08:29.000
Well, maybe.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.542
Look, Drex and I were only

08:29.041 --> 08:31.542

08:32.917 --> 08:34.333
We never even...

08:34.375 --> 08:36.208
we never even fought

08:34.375 --> 08:36.208

08:38.917 --> 08:40.041

08:40.083 --> 08:40.917

08:49.375 --> 08:50.959
- Yes?

08:49.375 --> 08:50.959
- What news?

08:51.000 --> 08:51.959
- It says that...

08:52.000 --> 08:53.917

08:59.583 --> 09:01.041
- I know where he's going.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.333
The bakery district.

09:04.083 --> 09:05.458
And when he gets there,

09:05.500 --> 09:07.375
he's gonna have to

09:05.500 --> 09:07.375
deal with me.

09:07.417 --> 09:08.333
HENRY: No!

09:08.375 --> 09:09.917
He's gonna have

09:08.375 --> 09:09.917
to deal with us.

09:09.959 --> 09:10.834
- No chance.

09:09.959 --> 09:10.834
- I'm going.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.000
- Forget it! You can't.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.917
- Gimme one reason

09:12.041 --> 09:13.917
why I can't go.

09:13.959 --> 09:15.750
- Gimme one reason!

09:15.792 --> 09:17.208
- Because...

09:17.250 --> 09:19.291
He used to be my sidekick,

09:17.250 --> 09:19.291
and now you're my sidekick,

09:19.333 --> 09:20.542
and if we're all together,

09:19.333 --> 09:20.542
I dunno man,

09:20.583 --> 09:21.875
it's just gonna be all weird.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.041

09:23.083 --> 09:24.125
to see your old sidekick,

09:24.166 --> 09:25.291
then I'm going.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.166
- Henry I--

09:25.333 --> 09:27.166
- Just let him go.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.750
- Yeah, c'mon man.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.000
- Fine!

09:30.041 --> 09:31.542
But if you're coming with me,

09:31.583 --> 09:32.917
you better put this on.

09:32.959 --> 09:34.041
- Woah...What's this?

09:34.083 --> 09:35.250
- It's a glove

09:35.291 --> 09:37.375
that shoots tranqulizing darts.

09:37.417 --> 09:39.750
You can use it

09:37.417 --> 09:39.750
to take down Drex.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.208
-'Kay.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.208
How's it work?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.417
- Just aim it at Ray's neck

09:45.458 --> 09:47.500
and pull the trigger.

09:50.542 --> 09:52.083
- Now, if I wasn't

09:50.542 --> 09:52.083
indestructible,

09:52.125 --> 09:53.583
that would have stuck in my neck

09:53.625 --> 09:55.458
and delivered enough

09:53.625 --> 09:55.458
hippo-grade tranquilizer

09:55.500 --> 09:56.792
to knock me out cold.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.208
- Where'd the dart go?

10:00.250 --> 10:02.875
- It's right here.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.458
- Charlotte, that's dangerous.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.458
Give it back to Schwoz.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.250
- Hey...

10:11.291 --> 10:13.917
has the Man Cave always been...

10:13.959 --> 10:14.834
covered in glitter?

10:17.375 --> 10:18.709
- Charlotte seems tired.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.458
- Whatever.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.458
If you're comin' with me

10:21.500 --> 10:23.750
you better pop a gum ball

10:21.500 --> 10:23.750
in your mouth, and fast.

10:23.792 --> 10:25.041
- Oh yeah.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.333
- How will you find Drex

10:25.083 --> 10:27.333
in the bakery district?

10:27.375 --> 10:29.333
- There's only one

10:27.375 --> 10:29.333
place he'd go,

10:29.375 --> 10:31.583
and I know that place.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.041
- Okay.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.875
Let's go meet your

10:40.083 --> 10:42.875

10:45.834 --> 10:47.500
- Ah geez.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.625
You wanna say it?

10:53.667 --> 10:56.834
- Nope. I probably won't say

10:53.667 --> 10:56.834
it as good as Drex would.

10:57.917 --> 11:00.834
- Up the tube.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.291

- I'm...I'm sorry?

12:46.041 --> 12:47.333
- It says "Free Nut Clusters

12:47.375 --> 12:49.000

12:49.041 --> 12:50.208
- What's a Nut Cluster?

12:50.250 --> 12:54.625
