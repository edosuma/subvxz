00:32.921 --> 00:34.922
Good morning.

00:34.924 --> 00:36.724
Oh. Hey. Morning.

00:36.726 --> 00:38.425
Everyone's gathered.
We're all ready if you are.

00:38.427 --> 00:39.927
Yeah, let's do it.

00:39.929 --> 00:40.961
You need that?

00:40.963 --> 00:42.763
Oh. Hey, uh,

00:42.765 --> 00:44.732
listen, Aaron...

00:44.734 --> 00:46.567
Thanks for letting me
set this up.

00:46.569 --> 00:48.486
But the whole team really
didn't need to be here.

00:48.488 --> 00:50.304
I'm the one
that owed the favor.

00:50.306 --> 00:52.106
Everyone insisted.

00:53.692 --> 00:55.826
How you doing?

00:56.945 --> 00:58.996
Sorry--what?

00:58.998 --> 00:59.980
You ok?

00:59.982 --> 01:01.615
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm great.

01:01.617 --> 01:03.334
I'm good. Uh...

01:03.336 --> 01:06.036
I'll meet you over there
in a minute, ok?

01:35.016 --> 01:38.152
It's rare that an
undergraduate criminology class

01:38.154 --> 01:40.538
gets guest speakers
of this caliber.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.374
But today
we're specially fortunate.

01:43.376 --> 01:45.376
I'd like to welcome
an old friend,

01:45.378 --> 01:48.662
esteemed author
and FBI Agent David Rossi,

01:48.664 --> 01:51.999
and his team,
the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

01:52.001 --> 01:55.052
Now, they've agreed to spend
an hour of their valuable time

01:55.054 --> 01:57.555
talking about what they do
and how they do it.

01:57.557 --> 01:59.590
So let's make them
feel welcome.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.518
Thank you, Dr. Grant.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.520
Now, when she said
I was an old friend,

02:13.522 --> 02:15.022
she was just referring
to the fact

02:15.024 --> 02:17.741
that we've known each other
for a very long time.

02:19.161 --> 02:20.694
Now, as the good
Professor said,

02:20.696 --> 02:24.381
I am supervisory
Special Agent Rossi.

02:24.383 --> 02:27.234
These are SSAs Jareau,

02:27.236 --> 02:28.719
Prentiss,

02:28.721 --> 02:31.255
Hotchner, and Morgan.

02:31.257 --> 02:33.173
This is Dr. Spencer Reid.

02:33.175 --> 02:36.093
And on keyboards today
we have our technical analyst

02:36.095 --> 02:37.911
Ms. Penelope Garcia.

02:37.913 --> 02:39.579
Hi.

02:39.581 --> 02:41.382
Now, in simple terms,

02:41.384 --> 02:44.385
at the BAU we use
behavioral science,

02:44.387 --> 02:47.921
research, casework,
and training

02:47.923 --> 02:50.190
to hunt down monsters.

02:50.192 --> 02:52.926
Rapists, terrorists,

02:52.928 --> 02:54.261
pedophiles,

02:54.263 --> 02:55.646
and our specialty,

02:55.648 --> 02:58.198
serial killers.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.369
Does anybody here know
exactly what a serial killer is?

03:02.371 --> 03:04.738
Someone who's committed
more than one murder.

03:04.740 --> 03:05.789
That's very good.

03:05.791 --> 03:08.075
By statute,
3 is the magic number.

03:08.077 --> 03:10.828
And it's actually more qualitative
than quantitative for us.

03:10.830 --> 03:12.684
And today we're going
to talk about how some

03:12.709 --> 03:14.709
serial killers get made.

03:15.918 --> 03:17.617
Because if you can
understand that,

03:17.619 --> 03:19.753
then you can figure out
a way to catch them.

03:19.755 --> 03:21.055
Garcia.

03:21.057 --> 03:22.973
My liege.

03:26.394 --> 03:28.345
Ok, this is Rachel Moore,

03:28.347 --> 03:31.065
a 17-year-old runaway
from Spokane, Washington.

03:31.067 --> 03:34.018
Now, she grew up poor
and in a broken home.

03:34.020 --> 03:38.072
Her mom left her dad because he
liked to drink and beat on her.

03:38.074 --> 03:40.407
And this is Tina Dyson,

03:40.409 --> 03:43.193
a 19-year-old college
student from Seattle.

03:43.195 --> 03:45.362
Now, she was
a trust fund kid,

03:45.364 --> 03:48.248
and she got straight As
and came from a loving family.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.284
Now, these two girls
couldn't be any more different.

03:50.286 --> 03:53.570
But the one thing
that they had in common

03:53.572 --> 03:58.759
is they both crossed paths
with the most prolific serial killer

03:58.761 --> 04:00.627
the BAU has ever seen.

04:00.629 --> 04:03.663
One thing you should understand
is that no two killers are the same.

04:03.665 --> 04:06.666
They each occupy their own point
on the behavioral spectrum.

04:06.668 --> 04:09.687
Genetics, brain chemistry,
psychology, and environment

04:09.689 --> 04:11.171
are all factors.

04:11.173 --> 04:13.006
But we believe that
this particular killer

04:13.008 --> 04:15.025
grew up in an environment
so adverse

04:15.027 --> 04:16.642
that he never had a chance.

04:16.644 --> 04:18.011
Bastard!

04:18.012 --> 04:21.648
He endured years of
cruel and abject physical abuse.

04:21.649 --> 04:25.703
As well as horribly
profound psychological abuse.

04:25.705 --> 04:27.788
No. No!

04:27.790 --> 04:30.857
When he wasn't being
ignored, he was being humiliated.

04:30.859 --> 04:32.159
Let me in!

04:32.161 --> 04:36.046
Let me in! Let me in!
Please!

04:36.048 --> 04:37.697
Now let me be clear.

04:37.699 --> 04:40.968
Most abused kids do not
turn into killers.

04:40.970 --> 04:44.671
Not even all psychopaths
become killers.

04:44.673 --> 04:47.558
But this particular
unknown subject,

04:47.560 --> 04:49.376
or unsub,

04:49.378 --> 04:52.012
suffered extreme abuse,

04:52.014 --> 04:56.717
and it has everything to do
with why he does what he does.

04:56.719 --> 05:00.354
Now, these are some
of his victims.

05:00.356 --> 05:03.857
He kidnapped them,
he restrained them,

05:03.859 --> 05:05.359
and he starved them
for days.

05:05.361 --> 05:08.245
Then he killed them by mutilating
their reproductive organs.

05:08.247 --> 05:12.499
Right now we know there are
at least 40 of them.

05:12.501 --> 05:15.452
But we believe that he may
eventually claim over 100 victims.

05:15.454 --> 05:17.004
Now, we chose this case
for today

05:17.006 --> 05:18.505
because we've been
discovering bodies

05:18.507 --> 05:22.876
up and down the West Coast
since 1992.

05:22.878 --> 05:25.212
For lack of a better word,

05:25.214 --> 05:27.364
it's a classic.

05:27.366 --> 05:29.883
This unsub's entire childhood

05:29.885 --> 05:31.685
was a crucible,

05:31.687 --> 05:35.699
and in it, a psychotic
killer was forged.

06:08.773 --> 06:10.591
The philosopher
Voltaire wrote,

06:10.592 --> 06:13.126
"to the living we owe respect,
but to the dead

06:13.279 --> 06:16.246
we owe only the truth."

06:16.448 --> 06:20.400
The dead are the cornerstone
of every homicide investigation.

06:20.402 --> 06:24.287
Victims give us a look
into the killer's mind.

06:24.289 --> 06:26.657
If you want to know
about a hunter,

06:26.659 --> 06:28.375
study his prey.

06:28.377 --> 06:30.460
Ok, so the unsub's
first victims

06:30.462 --> 06:32.162
were discovered two weeks apart

06:32.164 --> 06:34.414
in 1992 in Seattle.

06:34.416 --> 06:37.668
The first victim that was found
was Rachel Moore.

06:37.670 --> 06:38.969
She was the runaway.

06:38.971 --> 06:42.806
Her body had been thrown
into a dumpster in an alley.

06:42.808 --> 06:45.676
The medical examiner said
that she was very malnourished

06:45.678 --> 06:47.644
and really dehydrated.

06:47.646 --> 06:49.763
The ligature marks
on her wrists and ankles

06:49.765 --> 06:52.983
made it apparent that she'd
been restrained for days.

06:52.985 --> 06:56.186
He held her,
but he didn't feed her.

06:56.188 --> 06:57.604
So she's weak.

06:57.606 --> 07:00.607
It's his sadistic way
to subdue her.

07:00.609 --> 07:03.660
Several defensive wounds
on her hands and forearms.

07:03.662 --> 07:05.779
She put up
a hell of a fight.

07:05.781 --> 07:07.114
That a girl.

07:07.116 --> 07:10.117
53 stab wounds to the lower
abdomen and genitals.

07:10.119 --> 07:12.119
The damage made it
impossible to determine

07:12.121 --> 07:13.620
if there was
any sexual assault.

07:13.622 --> 07:16.489
That might be a forensic
countermeasure.

07:16.491 --> 07:18.291
Here's my report.

07:18.293 --> 07:20.660
Stay as long as you need.

07:20.662 --> 07:24.214
Her mother should be here
in an hour.

07:24.216 --> 07:28.351
A hell of a way to see her
after 2 years.

07:30.171 --> 07:33.807
53 stab wounds.
That's a lot of work.

07:33.809 --> 07:36.526
Does anyone want to tell me
what they think that means?

07:36.528 --> 07:37.561
Hatred?

07:37.563 --> 07:38.645
Frustration.

07:38.647 --> 07:40.197
He's angry.

07:40.199 --> 07:42.115
You're all correct.
It's called overkill.

07:42.117 --> 07:45.652
Typically it means the murder
was personal somehow.

07:45.654 --> 07:47.821
That, or the unsub
is psychotic

07:47.823 --> 07:49.740
and/or prone to
violent outbursts.

07:50.993 --> 07:53.376
The overkill may also show
his inexperience.

07:53.378 --> 07:55.579
This was probably
his first kill,

07:55.581 --> 07:58.248
and he was feeling his way
through it, working out his M.O.

07:58.250 --> 08:02.535
But there's a lot about Rachel
that tells us about the unsub.

08:02.537 --> 08:05.422
She was young,
so most likely he was, too.

08:05.424 --> 08:06.757
What makes you think that?

08:06.759 --> 08:09.559
She lived in a shelter
and had a part-time job,

08:09.561 --> 08:11.044
so she was a street kid,

08:11.046 --> 08:12.929
but not necessarily
the reckless type.

08:12.931 --> 08:15.182
She wouldn't just
go off with anyone.

08:15.184 --> 08:17.484
Yeah, Warden, it's Rossi.

08:17.486 --> 08:18.985
What?

08:18.987 --> 08:19.970
Riot?

08:19.972 --> 08:21.655
W-w-w-wait.

08:21.657 --> 08:24.324
Look, he's not gonna
give me a rain check.

08:24.326 --> 08:25.609
I have to see him today.

08:25.611 --> 08:28.128
So the unsub maybe
lured her with a ruse

08:28.130 --> 08:30.630
or he blitz attacked her,
he took her by surprise.

08:30.632 --> 08:33.116
Now, either one of these would
be easier if you were young.

08:33.118 --> 08:35.118
You can tell all that
from just one victim?

08:35.120 --> 08:37.337
I'd say it was two weeks later
when we found the second victim

08:37.339 --> 08:39.039
that we started
to piece that together.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.258
Tina Dyson was home for the
summer when she disappeared.

08:41.260 --> 08:44.511
Her body was found in a shallow
grave just outside of Seattle.

08:44.513 --> 08:46.129
But it was actually
her abduction site

08:46.131 --> 08:48.715
that gave us the answers
we needed.

08:49.968 --> 08:52.185
Tina and two
of her friends had fake I.D.s

08:52.187 --> 08:55.255
and they decided to go
to a local grunge bar.

08:58.526 --> 09:01.061
But they drank
too much and Tina got sick,

09:01.063 --> 09:03.396
so while one friend
was inside dancing,

09:03.398 --> 09:06.599
the other went out
to hold Tina's hair.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.902
It's all right.
Come on.

09:11.439 --> 09:13.456
I'm gonna go get Janice, ok?
We're going home.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.659
Ohh...Good, yeah.

09:20.464 --> 09:22.966
Ohh...Ohh...

09:29.307 --> 09:31.291
You ok?

09:31.293 --> 09:34.978
Yeah. Jeez,
what are you, a ninja?

09:34.980 --> 09:36.813
Where'd you come from?

09:38.349 --> 09:41.634
So his anger is obviously
directed at women.

09:41.636 --> 09:43.303
Yes, but the real
question is why,

09:43.305 --> 09:45.572
and the why is what always
leads us to the who.

09:45.574 --> 09:46.940
I need to talk to you.

09:46.942 --> 09:48.975
He was attacking their genitals
and reproductive organs.

09:48.977 --> 09:50.243
Why?

09:50.245 --> 09:51.477
Was he impotent

09:51.479 --> 09:53.313
and hates the thing
that he can't have?

09:53.315 --> 09:57.250
Did his wife or girlfriend
abort a child?

09:57.252 --> 09:58.351
It's a federal prison, Dave.

09:58.376 --> 10:00.376
We can't just call them up
and tell them what to do.

10:00.455 --> 10:04.207
You have to know someone
in justice who can pull some strings.

10:04.209 --> 10:07.627
I've got to see him today,
Aaron. You know that.

10:07.629 --> 10:08.995
The possibilities
are endless.

10:08.997 --> 10:11.497
And the unsub was figuring
it all out for himself, too.

10:11.499 --> 10:13.133
We know that because
he was evolving.

10:13.135 --> 10:17.270
He started with a runaway,
a victim with a high-risk lifestyle.

10:17.272 --> 10:19.806
He probably knew that her abduction
would go unreported.

10:19.808 --> 10:22.726
Then he upped his game
and grabbed a college girl,

10:22.728 --> 10:24.895
which meant more risk
for himself.

10:24.897 --> 10:27.180
He dumped his first victim
Rachel in an alley,

10:27.182 --> 10:28.681
but he took the time
to bury Tina,

10:28.683 --> 10:31.284
which suggests he felt
more connected to her

10:31.286 --> 10:33.069
and perhaps he even
felt remorse.

10:33.071 --> 10:34.654
Did you ever
catch this guy?

10:34.656 --> 10:36.523
Uh, what's your name,
young man?

10:36.525 --> 10:37.958
David Zimmerman.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.326
Don't interrupt, Zimmerman.

10:41.580 --> 10:44.497
Now, we, uh, we knew
we needed to warn the public,

10:44.499 --> 10:48.168
so we contacted the media,
papers, local news.

10:48.170 --> 10:51.537
That was back before
the Internet exploded.

10:51.539 --> 10:54.724
And then, as will happen
from time to time,

10:54.726 --> 10:57.060
the case went completely cold.

10:57.062 --> 11:02.098
We didn't hear from him
again until 1997.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.932
Two bodies were found
in Golden Gate Park,

11:04.957 --> 11:06.957
in San Francisco.

11:07.022 --> 11:08.521
Same M.O.

11:08.523 --> 11:10.941
Evidently our guy.

11:16.664 --> 11:18.898
Excuse me, I'm looking
for the case Agent.

11:18.900 --> 11:21.334
That would be me.
Agent Rossi, I'm Agent Hotchner,

11:21.336 --> 11:23.370
Seattle division.
We spoke on the phone.

11:23.372 --> 11:25.086
Uh, I inherited the case
from Agent Bidwell.

11:25.111 --> 11:26.674
Thanks for coming so quickly.

11:26.675 --> 11:28.508
Yeah, I hopped the first
flight from Dulles.

11:28.510 --> 11:30.010
Came straight from
the airport.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.928
That's a long trip.
With bad food.

11:31.930 --> 11:33.463
Let me show you
what we found.

11:33.465 --> 11:35.682
A jogger discovered the first
body dumped in the bushes

11:35.684 --> 11:37.801
about 30 yards
over the road here.

11:37.803 --> 11:39.719
The M.E. said that she'd
been there almost a month.

11:39.721 --> 11:41.187
Any critters get to her?

11:41.189 --> 11:43.556
We had to use dental records
to identify her. Watch your step.

11:43.558 --> 11:45.141
So we did a search
of the area

11:45.143 --> 11:47.527
and we discovered the second
body in this shallow grave.

11:47.529 --> 11:49.312
She'd been here
less than a week.

11:49.314 --> 11:52.449
So, he dumped the first one
and buried the second.

11:52.451 --> 11:54.401
Just like he did in '92.

11:54.403 --> 11:56.202
The first victim--
was she a runaway?

11:56.204 --> 11:58.154
25-year-old prostitute
and crack addict.

11:58.156 --> 11:59.605
The second?

11:59.607 --> 12:01.241
A 27-year-old
mother of two.

12:01.243 --> 12:03.086
Both women had had
their reproductive organs

12:03.111 --> 12:04.462
completely removed.

12:04.463 --> 12:06.880
Not just mangled.
He's evolving.

12:06.882 --> 12:09.165
Sounds like he's moving
more toward ritual.

12:09.167 --> 12:10.917
And apparently he's not
locked into an age preference.

12:10.919 --> 12:13.753
The victims seem to be
aging along with him.

12:13.755 --> 12:15.138
What about stomach contents?

12:15.140 --> 12:18.008
The victims were dehydrated
and hadn't eaten in days.

12:18.010 --> 12:20.260
My guess is he hasn't been
back in Seattle in a while.

12:20.262 --> 12:21.895
What makes you say that?

12:21.897 --> 12:24.264
He needs someplace private
to hold them.

12:24.266 --> 12:25.631
He might live close.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.817
Dumping a body
in a public park is risky.

12:27.819 --> 12:31.471
It tells me that
he's comfortable, settled in.

12:31.473 --> 12:33.558
He might even have chosen
this spot to be able to come

12:33.583 --> 12:35.493
back and relive the kills.

12:35.494 --> 12:37.477
You've done your homework,
Agent.

12:37.479 --> 12:40.013
5 years is a long time
to be dormant.

12:40.015 --> 12:42.198
He wasn't dormant.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.203
A killer that vicious
is like a drug addict

12:45.228 --> 12:46.420
that needs a fix.

12:46.421 --> 12:48.838
We were fairly certain
that he had kept on killing.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.673
We just hadn't
found the bodies yet.

12:50.675 --> 12:53.009
Now, we knew
that back in '92

12:53.011 --> 12:55.462
when the media went wide
with the story,

12:55.464 --> 13:00.050
our unsub got spooked
and he disappeared.

13:01.886 --> 13:04.854
So we tried to get
in front of it,

13:04.856 --> 13:07.941
meaning that if we could control
the spread of information,

13:07.943 --> 13:10.393
we might be able to keep the
unsub from fleeing again.

13:10.395 --> 13:12.529
But back then
the BAU was still young.

13:12.531 --> 13:16.082
We didn't have press liaisons
or technical analysts.

13:16.084 --> 13:17.458
By the time
we contacted the media,

13:17.483 --> 13:19.374
the story had already broken.

13:25.826 --> 13:27.660
A symbol
of the American west--

13:27.662 --> 13:29.329
a lone coyote hunts
for prey.

13:29.331 --> 13:32.132
Agent Rossi, are you making
any progress in the investigation?

13:32.134 --> 13:33.416
Quite a bit, yes.

13:33.418 --> 13:35.301
So do you have
any solid leads?

13:35.303 --> 13:36.252
Several.

13:36.254 --> 13:38.171
Agent Rossi, can you
confirm the rumors

13:38.173 --> 13:40.540
that the Womb Raider
disembowels his victims?

13:40.542 --> 13:41.874
Excuse me?

13:41.876 --> 13:43.676
Can you confirms
the rumors that the womb--

13:43.678 --> 13:45.595
Oh, I'll confirm
something for you.

13:45.597 --> 13:48.098
Womb Raider is a name
that you gave him.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.216
I won't glorify him.
I call him a murderer.

13:50.218 --> 13:52.318
Then exactly how
is he killing them?

13:52.320 --> 13:54.654
My only concern
is capturing him

13:54.656 --> 13:57.490
and bringing closure
to the families of the victims.

13:57.492 --> 13:58.891
No further questions.

14:09.645 --> 14:11.095
"Womb Raider."

14:11.097 --> 14:13.564
I hoped the nickname
would embolden him.

14:13.566 --> 14:17.819
Thought maybe he would escalate
and trip on his own hubris.

14:17.821 --> 14:20.688
But, um, that didn't happen.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.107
Unfortunately, he vanished just like
he'd done before

14:23.109 --> 14:24.592
and the trail
went cold again.

14:24.594 --> 14:25.943
We did everything we could.

14:25.945 --> 14:28.780
We had every division
up and down the West Coast

14:28.782 --> 14:31.115
scouring
missing person reports.

14:31.117 --> 14:34.902
A lot of possibilities,
but no clear hits.

14:34.904 --> 14:37.421
In the meantime,
Agent Rossi retired,

14:37.423 --> 14:39.423
but the BAU grew.

14:39.425 --> 14:41.626
We trained more profilers,

14:41.628 --> 14:44.212
hired tech analysts,
press liaisons,

14:44.214 --> 14:45.913
and we even got
our own resident genius.

14:45.915 --> 14:47.849
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:50.253 --> 14:52.103
Agent Rossi,
why did you retire?

14:53.222 --> 14:55.356
That's a good question.

14:55.358 --> 14:58.425
Well, the simple answer
is I needed a change.

14:58.427 --> 15:00.695
I was working on my
third divorce, and...

15:00.697 --> 15:01.762
Third?

15:01.764 --> 15:03.865
Yes, Zimmerman,
my third.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.434
So I needed a break,
and I figured writing books

15:07.436 --> 15:10.104
might help give me
some peace of mind.

15:10.106 --> 15:12.907
Did it?
Give you peace of mind?

15:12.909 --> 15:15.076
For a time, yes.

15:15.078 --> 15:17.784
In 2005, we got another hit
on the unsub,

15:17.809 --> 15:18.747
this time in Los Angeles.

15:18.748 --> 15:21.249
We knew it was him
because of his signature.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.750
Sorry, what's a signature?

15:22.752 --> 15:24.886
It's a rare combination
of M.O. and ritual

15:24.888 --> 15:27.889
that allows us to link cases over
time and geographic distances.

15:27.891 --> 15:31.142
Her name was Lana Cooper.
She was a 33-year-old prostitute.

15:31.144 --> 15:35.263
Her body was found by a boy
walking his dog in Griffith Park.

15:35.265 --> 15:38.966
Ligature marks on her wrists
and ankles. She was restrained.

15:38.968 --> 15:40.768
And he gave her
a complete hysterectomy.

15:40.770 --> 15:44.572
The uterus, ovaries,
fallopian tubes, all removed.

15:44.574 --> 15:47.325
A little crude, but he cut all
the right ligaments.

15:47.327 --> 15:48.826
He knew what he was doing.

15:48.828 --> 15:50.328
What about her throat?

15:50.330 --> 15:53.331
That was done postmortem.
He cut out her vocal cords.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.833
Might be a symbolic way
of keeping her silent.

15:55.835 --> 15:58.452
So she was alive when he
performed the hysterectomy.

15:58.454 --> 16:00.421
Anything in her stomach?

16:00.423 --> 16:02.673
Dry as a bone.
She hadn't eaten in days.

16:02.675 --> 16:04.258
So he starved her, too.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.693
That's
a pretty specific M.O.

16:05.695 --> 16:07.211
This probably isn't
his first victim.

16:07.213 --> 16:09.597
I wonder if we should be looking
at doctors and medical students.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.265
It's definitely
not his first victim.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.718
I don't think he's a doctor
or a medical student.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.020
No.
Calling Gideon?

16:16.022 --> 16:18.356
The first call I made
was to Agent Rossi.

16:18.358 --> 16:19.774
I knew he was writing his book,

16:19.776 --> 16:24.779
but I didn't want to start
to build a profile without him.

16:24.781 --> 16:27.982
A profile is personality
and identifying characteristics

16:27.984 --> 16:31.336
of the unsub which helps
the investigator narrow

16:31.361 --> 16:32.520
down the suspect pool.

16:32.521 --> 16:34.155
Basically it's a behavioral
description

16:34.157 --> 16:37.124
of the type of person
we think the unsub might be.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.326
It goes a little like this--

16:38.328 --> 16:40.328
we were looking for
a white male

16:40.330 --> 16:42.246
in his early to mid-30s.

16:42.248 --> 16:45.633
We think he was antisocial
and had low self-esteem,

16:45.635 --> 16:47.201
so he probably
kept to himself.

16:47.203 --> 16:48.753
But he needed money,

16:48.755 --> 16:51.587
so he was most likely
a day laborer, a janitor,

16:51.612 --> 16:52.707
maybe a handyman.

16:52.708 --> 16:54.541
Anything menial
and temporary.

16:54.543 --> 16:56.928
He was personable enough
to get a job wherever he went,

16:56.930 --> 16:59.847
but unassuming enough
not to stick out.

16:59.849 --> 17:01.983
He held and restrained
his victims for days,

17:01.985 --> 17:04.550
so he would need
a contained space to do that.

17:04.553 --> 17:07.387
But he was also mobile. That
meant he had his own transport.

17:07.390 --> 17:09.390
Most likely a truck
or a van.

17:09.392 --> 17:12.443
And when he was on the move
and not settled,

17:12.444 --> 17:13.894
he probably lived
out of that vehicle.

17:13.896 --> 17:15.413
We knew he always
started with a victim

17:15.415 --> 17:17.080
who lived a high-risk
lifestyle,

17:17.083 --> 17:19.416
like a prostitute
or a runaway.

17:19.419 --> 17:22.869
And then he moved on to a victim
with a low-risk lifestyle.

17:22.872 --> 17:25.433
So we knew his next kill
would be something of

17:25.458 --> 17:27.458
a soccer mom in her 30s.

17:28.795 --> 17:31.431
I'm sorry, but what exactly
was he doing with the organs

17:31.456 --> 17:32.848
he was removing?

17:32.849 --> 17:35.266
We didn't know. It could have been
some sort of fetish.

17:35.268 --> 17:36.767
Russian serial killer
Andrei Chikatilo

17:36.769 --> 17:38.602
actually ate the uterus
of one of his victims.

17:38.604 --> 17:40.054
Oh, my God, eew.

17:40.056 --> 17:41.889
This focus on
reproductive organs

17:41.891 --> 17:44.483
could also indicate
a deep-seated sense

17:44.508 --> 17:45.694
of self-loathing.

17:45.695 --> 17:48.229
He might have hated
the fact that he was born.

17:48.231 --> 17:50.147
Or he had some sort of traumatic
life-changing event

17:50.149 --> 17:51.598
associated with birth.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.735
And he could have hated
his own mother.

17:54.737 --> 17:57.425
The strained mother-child
relationship is a hallmark

17:57.450 --> 17:58.290
for many killers.

17:58.291 --> 17:59.740
That doesn't make any sense.

17:59.742 --> 18:01.742
I hate myself
or I hate my mother,

18:01.744 --> 18:05.212
so I kill women
by ripping out their wombs?

18:05.214 --> 18:07.531
It only needs
to make sense to him.

18:07.533 --> 18:10.251
One man's logic
is another man's crazy.

18:10.253 --> 18:12.253
What's the deal with
the vocal cords?

18:12.255 --> 18:13.921
That was something new.

18:13.923 --> 18:16.123
We thought it might have been
symbolic of his own silence.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.125
He was raised to believe
he was worthless and unwanted,

18:18.127 --> 18:20.094
so essentially
he never had his own voice.

18:20.096 --> 18:22.580
His victims became
surrogates for his rage

18:22.582 --> 18:26.717
and a means by which
to exact his revenge.

18:37.112 --> 18:40.281
We stayed in L.A. for 6 weeks
and worked the case.

18:40.283 --> 18:42.283
And then it went cold,
again.

18:42.285 --> 18:44.318
No low-risk soccer
mom turned up,

18:44.320 --> 18:45.953
no soccer moms
went missing.

18:45.955 --> 18:47.755
Then our resources
were exhausted,

18:47.757 --> 18:50.157
we had other cases,
so we were forced to leave.

18:50.159 --> 18:52.943
But I rented a house
in the Hollywood Hills

18:52.945 --> 18:55.346
and decided to finish
my book out there.

18:55.348 --> 18:58.920
I figured if I was close
I could lend a hand

18:58.945 --> 19:00.585
if something happened.

19:00.586 --> 19:03.888
3 months I stayed and nothing.

19:06.391 --> 19:09.276
Now, in the past
he packed up and moved

19:09.278 --> 19:11.729
when the story broke
and we got too close.

19:11.731 --> 19:14.065
But this time
the media was quiet.

19:14.067 --> 19:17.952
The victim was a hooker
nobody cared about.

19:17.954 --> 19:20.121
So, what drove him under?

19:20.123 --> 19:23.524
It would be 4 years
before we got another break.

19:23.526 --> 19:28.162
Not too long after,
I came out of retirement.

19:31.633 --> 19:32.800
What?

19:32.802 --> 19:35.302
Rochelle Jenkins,
a 40-year-old prostitute

19:35.304 --> 19:36.837
was found dumped
in an alley in Seattle.

19:36.839 --> 19:38.806
She was given
a complete hysterectomy.

19:38.808 --> 19:41.842
Her vocal cords
were cut out, too.

19:41.844 --> 19:44.395
He's back where he got started.

19:44.397 --> 19:47.348
He'll be on the hunt for a
low-risk victim in her 40s next.

19:47.350 --> 19:50.684
I wonder
what brought him home.

19:50.686 --> 19:52.887
It's a long trip.
We should get going.

19:52.889 --> 19:55.990
But this time
we were ready for him.

19:55.992 --> 19:58.242
We wanted to use the press
to our advantage.

19:58.244 --> 20:02.163
So we came up with what's called
a targeted media strategy.

20:02.165 --> 20:04.281
Agent, is it true
you have a suspect in custody?

20:04.283 --> 20:05.833
Yes, he's being
questioned as we speak.

20:05.835 --> 20:08.619
Can you tell us
how you apprehended him?

20:08.621 --> 20:11.872
With good police work,
especially from the Seattle P.D.

20:11.874 --> 20:13.624
and the Washington State Patrol.

20:13.626 --> 20:15.577
Is it true that the killer's
been on the loose

20:15.602 --> 20:16.711
since the early nineties?

20:16.712 --> 20:19.296
That remains to be seen,
but we do believe

20:19.298 --> 20:20.931
we can link him
to several murders.

20:20.933 --> 20:23.917
Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse us,
we've got work to do.

20:23.919 --> 20:25.219
So you did catch him.

20:25.221 --> 20:29.723
No. But we wanted him to think
we caught the wrong guy.

20:29.725 --> 20:30.691
Why?

20:30.693 --> 20:32.610
To give him a false
sense of security.

20:32.612 --> 20:35.404
If he thinks we messed up,
then maybe he relaxes

20:35.429 --> 20:36.948
and makes a mistake.

20:36.949 --> 20:39.450
That, or he gets angry
because he thinks someone else

20:39.452 --> 20:40.901
is stealing his thunder.

20:40.903 --> 20:42.486
Either way,
the aim of the strategy

20:42.488 --> 20:44.321
is the throw the killer
off course.

20:44.323 --> 20:46.157
Otherwise, all we're doing
is reacting to him,

20:46.159 --> 20:49.210
and we needed him
to react to us.

20:49.212 --> 20:51.078
Lord knows I love him, but here's
to a night without him.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.380
Husbands, too.
To the kids.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.582
Ok, fine, have it your way.

20:54.584 --> 20:56.634
We're too old for this.

20:56.636 --> 20:58.002
Speak for yourself.

20:58.004 --> 21:02.089
Ok, ladies, bottoms up,
lick, drink, suck. Yeah?

21:04.059 --> 21:05.426
Mm!

21:05.428 --> 21:07.561
Whoo-hoo!
Ha ha!

21:07.563 --> 21:09.963
She's whoo-hooing, you know
we're in for a long night.

21:11.150 --> 21:12.466
We need some more water.

21:12.468 --> 21:14.802
We should get another round.

21:16.355 --> 21:17.821
You're insane.

21:22.778 --> 21:25.362
Play date tomorrow?
Meet me at the park?

21:25.364 --> 21:27.414
Can't. Soccer game
and birthday party. Sunday?

21:27.416 --> 21:28.449
Ok.
Sure.

21:28.451 --> 21:29.667
You all right to drive?

21:29.669 --> 21:30.984
That drink was what,

21:30.986 --> 21:32.703
two hours and
a big dinner ago.

21:32.705 --> 21:34.821
I'm fine. Go.
Are you sure?

21:34.823 --> 21:35.822
Bye, sweetie.

21:35.824 --> 21:36.823
Bye, girls.

21:36.825 --> 21:37.875
I'll talk to you soon, ok?

21:37.877 --> 21:39.293
Ok.
Yes.

21:39.295 --> 21:41.128
Good night.

21:42.430 --> 21:45.132
Hey, honey.
I'm on the way home.

21:45.134 --> 21:46.517
How are the boys?

21:47.503 --> 21:50.671
Oh, it was fun.
Everyone says hi. Ok.

21:50.673 --> 21:52.673
Love you, too.

21:52.675 --> 21:55.809
Bye.

22:12.780 --> 22:15.198
He's been moving south
this whole time.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.068
He could have gone east
or bounced back up north,

22:18.070 --> 22:20.070
but no, always south.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.905
Almost like he's running
from something.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.272
Well, he's running from us.

22:23.274 --> 22:25.625
But why go back home now,
after all these years?

22:25.627 --> 22:27.210
Something brought him back.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.045
Rochelle Jenkins
was in her 40s,

22:29.047 --> 22:30.580
so we can assume
he is, too.

22:30.582 --> 22:33.049
Ok, so why do people
come home at that age?

22:33.051 --> 22:36.002
Family, special occasions,
funeral.

22:36.004 --> 22:37.003
Wait a minute.

22:37.005 --> 22:39.172
You guys have your own jet?

22:39.174 --> 22:42.258
Yes, Zimmerman,
as a matter of fact, we do.

22:43.261 --> 22:44.311
Show them, Penelope.

22:44.313 --> 22:45.962
One second...

22:45.964 --> 22:47.814
Ok. There you go.

22:47.816 --> 22:49.316
Ooh...
Pretty sweet, huh?

22:49.318 --> 22:50.317
Yeah.

22:52.020 --> 22:54.988
Hey, guys, a missing persons
report just came in.

22:54.990 --> 22:56.823
42 years old, Grace Powell,
mother of two,

22:56.825 --> 22:58.425
went out for girls night,
never came home.

22:58.427 --> 22:59.943
That's gotta be him.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.329
Garcia, where did he
take her from?

23:02.331 --> 23:03.413
Um...

23:03.415 --> 23:05.915
I recognized the place
immediately.

23:05.917 --> 23:09.485
It was hard to forget.

23:09.487 --> 23:13.623
This is where he took
Tina Dyson from in '92.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.675
This restaurant
was a dive bar.

23:15.677 --> 23:17.677
A dive bar?
In this neighborhood?

23:17.679 --> 23:19.162
Things were different then.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.647
He didn't
just come back home.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.432
He returned
to the exact same spot.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.518
But why here? What is it
about this place?

23:25.520 --> 23:28.421
It's where he grabbed
one of his first kills.

23:28.423 --> 23:30.590
The first ones
are always significant.

23:30.592 --> 23:32.942
And this is where my particular
skill set comes in handy.

23:32.944 --> 23:37.197
See, I am like one of those
wonderful people in prison movies

23:37.199 --> 23:38.698
that can get you
anything you need.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.867
And we needed to know
everything there was to know

23:40.869 --> 23:42.652
about this particular
part of the city.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.070
So I went honey badger.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.740
I dug up police reports,
news articles,

23:46.742 --> 23:48.158
parking tickets, even.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.860
If anything went down
in that area in the last 40 years,

23:50.862 --> 23:52.195
I knew about it.

23:52.197 --> 23:53.496
And I found zip.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.131
Zero. Stingy with the dinero.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.533
Couple of Fender-benders.
A bar fight.

23:57.535 --> 23:59.719
There was a homeless guy
who was into mooning people,

23:59.721 --> 24:01.921
but no life-changers.

24:01.923 --> 24:04.707
So I extended my search
another 10 years

24:04.709 --> 24:06.209
and I found this.

24:07.544 --> 24:11.514
This is a police report
from 1966,

24:11.516 --> 24:13.850
where a 16-year-old girl
was found raped

24:13.852 --> 24:15.885
in a parked car
on that street.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.353
But she was a minor,

24:17.355 --> 24:18.938
so her name wasn't
listed on the report.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.608
Well, what's this girl
got to do with a serial killer?

24:21.610 --> 24:24.327
Pump your brakes, sweetcakes,
'cause I'm bringing it home.

24:24.329 --> 24:26.429
It turns out that Jane Doe,
instead of given a name,

24:26.431 --> 24:28.281
she was given a patient number.

24:28.283 --> 24:29.532
So I tracked that number,

24:29.534 --> 24:32.118
and it turned out that
she went back to that hospital

24:32.120 --> 24:34.721
several times after...

24:34.723 --> 24:36.706
for prenatal care.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.008
And she eventually
brought that baby to term.

24:45.232 --> 24:49.636
Aah!

24:49.638 --> 24:51.805
She hemorrhaged badly
during childbirth,

24:51.807 --> 24:54.340
and during her emergency
hysterectomy

24:54.342 --> 24:56.226
she died.

24:57.261 --> 24:59.312
It was at that point
that I was able to find

24:59.314 --> 25:01.264
the corresponding
death certificate

25:01.266 --> 25:03.032
and get her name.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.734
Georgina Yates.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.936
Her son Thomas Yates survived.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.205
He was put into the custody
of his grandparents

25:09.207 --> 25:11.908
Trudy and Roy Yates,
Georgina's parents.

25:11.910 --> 25:16.246
When we started
looking at Thomas...

25:16.248 --> 25:17.881
We knew.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.549
Growing up, he got
kicked out of two schools,

25:19.551 --> 25:21.835
both times for starting fires.

25:21.837 --> 25:23.786
Fire-starting
is the first part

25:23.788 --> 25:26.306
of what we used to call
the homicidal triad.

25:26.308 --> 25:29.625
The other two parts are
bedwetting and cruelty to animals.

25:29.627 --> 25:32.095
He was also in the emergency
room a lot as a kid.

25:32.097 --> 25:35.215
He had a broken arm, burns,
he broke a rib once.

25:35.217 --> 25:38.768
So he was either very clumsy
or he was being beaten.

25:38.770 --> 25:41.771
Then when he was 15,
he committed his first murder.

25:41.773 --> 25:46.142
He was a skinny kid who snapped
and stabbed a bully at school.

25:52.482 --> 25:55.118
He was convicted,
served 3 years in juvey,

25:55.120 --> 25:58.154
another 7 in prison, and then
he was released on parole.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.973
But when
he was on the inside,

25:59.975 --> 26:02.058
he spilled his guts
to the prison shrink.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.660
He talked about how his
grandmother would starve him

26:04.662 --> 26:06.145
and make him sleep
in the dog house.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.014
How she would
beat him senseless...

26:08.016 --> 26:09.349
I wish you were never born!

26:09.351 --> 26:10.884
And sit on him
until he couldn't breathe.

26:10.886 --> 26:12.001
You're a curse!

26:12.003 --> 26:13.636
I hate you!

26:13.638 --> 26:15.471
And you actually
believed this guy?

26:15.473 --> 26:17.941
The prison psychiatrist
concluded that Thomas

26:17.943 --> 26:19.726
was telling the truth.

26:19.728 --> 26:21.060
His childhood
medical records

26:21.062 --> 26:23.630
also corroborated
this story.

26:23.632 --> 26:25.448
And at that point we realized
it wasn't the mother

26:25.450 --> 26:27.617
but the grandmother
who was the object of his rage.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.852
I have Senator
Hendricks on the line.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.738
Then I find out
his grandfather had just died,

26:31.740 --> 26:33.740
and his grandmother
had lung cancer

26:33.742 --> 26:37.160
and she had just been
admitted into hospice care.

26:37.162 --> 26:42.181
And that is what
brought Thomas home.

26:50.707 --> 26:54.310
Excuse me, uh,
Mrs. Trudy Yates?

26:54.312 --> 26:55.812
Who are you?

26:55.814 --> 26:58.431
I'm Agent Prentiss. This is
Agent Jareau. We're with the FBI.

26:58.433 --> 27:01.050
FBI? You got
the right Trudy Yates?

27:01.052 --> 27:03.653
Yes, I'm pretty sure
we do, ma'am.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.188
You're Thomas' grandmother,
right?

27:05.190 --> 27:06.356
What about it?

27:06.358 --> 27:07.523
We're looking for him.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.443
Tommy? He in trouble?

27:10.445 --> 27:12.579
What'd he do this time?

27:12.581 --> 27:13.830
Do you know where he is?

27:13.832 --> 27:14.998
No idea.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.617
When was the last time
you saw him?

27:17.619 --> 27:20.236
The day he put me
in this damn place.

27:20.238 --> 27:23.339
My daughter's womb
was cursed.

27:23.341 --> 27:26.125
That boy was a bastard
born in sin.

27:26.127 --> 27:29.045
Nothing good
comes out of sin.

27:32.049 --> 27:33.650
This is all we have.
Thank you so much.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.219
Please give us a call
if you think of anything else.

27:36.221 --> 27:37.387
Will do.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.888
Thank you.

27:45.263 --> 27:46.696
Baby, what can I do you for?

27:46.698 --> 27:48.564
Hey, mama, I need you
to run a number.

27:48.566 --> 27:52.035
206-555-0112.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.871
Okey-dokey. It is a prepaid
cell phone, hasn't been used in days.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.372
And what about this address?

27:56.374 --> 27:59.108
2334 Dawson Street,
unit K.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.711
Hold yourself, please.

28:04.748 --> 28:09.785
Unit K? He needs to be more
isolated than an apartment.

28:09.787 --> 28:11.620
It was a storage container.

28:11.622 --> 28:13.560
The same storage container
where his grandmother's

28:13.585 --> 28:15.585
stuff was being held.

28:33.577 --> 28:35.695
You smell that?

28:35.697 --> 28:38.314
It's coffee.

28:39.816 --> 28:42.368
FBI!

28:42.370 --> 28:44.003
Drop it.

28:47.324 --> 28:49.658
Thomas Yates,
you're under arrest.

28:53.847 --> 28:56.099
She's still got a pulse.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.501
Calling an ambulance.

28:58.503 --> 29:00.103
Agent Rossi.

29:00.105 --> 29:04.107
Nice to meet you
after all these years.

29:07.534 --> 29:10.176
We got Grace Powell
to the hospital in time

29:10.276 --> 29:11.325
and they saved her life.

29:11.327 --> 29:12.627
Though I'm not sure

29:12.629 --> 29:15.713
her psychological wounds
will ever heal.

29:15.715 --> 29:17.548
How come I've never
heard of this guy?

29:17.550 --> 29:20.167
Have you ever heard
of Efren Saldivar?

29:20.169 --> 29:21.168
No.

29:21.170 --> 29:23.220
David Parker Ray.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.840
How about
John Edward Robinson?

29:25.842 --> 29:30.094
See, at any given time,
we have at least 25 open cases.

29:30.096 --> 29:32.430
Every year we're able
to close around 15,

29:32.432 --> 29:35.182
yet new ones
still seem to pop up.

29:35.184 --> 29:38.436
There are more serial killers
out there than you may think.

29:38.438 --> 29:41.138
But we finally had Yates
in custody,

29:41.140 --> 29:44.325
and we questioned him
for two weeks straight.

29:44.327 --> 29:46.610
We all took turns.

29:46.612 --> 29:48.412
He didn't say a word.

29:48.414 --> 29:49.981
Never asked for
a bathroom break,

29:49.983 --> 29:51.916
glass of water, nothing.

29:51.918 --> 29:54.418
I thought given his M.O.,
being female,

29:54.420 --> 29:57.621
I might be able to strike a nerve,
get him to open up,

29:57.623 --> 30:00.991
but he just sat there,
for hours.

30:00.993 --> 30:03.127
Staying absolutely silent
under that kind of pressure

30:03.129 --> 30:05.796
was a skill he undoubtedly
learned as a child.

30:05.798 --> 30:07.298
He was rendered silent
for so long,

30:07.300 --> 30:09.100
it became
a conditioned response.

30:09.102 --> 30:11.385
But we had him
safely in custody.

30:11.387 --> 30:13.387
And we had other
cases to solve.

30:13.389 --> 30:16.173
Eventually Yates was tried and
he received the death penalty.

30:16.175 --> 30:18.309
And life went on.

30:18.311 --> 30:22.012
Then two years ago today...

30:22.014 --> 30:23.464
I got a call.

30:27.186 --> 30:28.819
Rossi.

30:28.821 --> 30:30.821
You have a call
from an inmate

30:30.823 --> 30:32.289
in a correctional
facility.

30:32.291 --> 30:34.241
Inmate,
state your name.

30:34.243 --> 30:36.293
It's Tommy Yates.

30:36.295 --> 30:38.662
This call may be monitored
and recorded.

30:38.664 --> 30:40.364
Press 2 if you
accept the charges.

30:40.366 --> 30:41.716
If not, hang up.

30:41.718 --> 30:44.268
He called you personally?
How'd he get your number?

30:44.270 --> 30:45.820
Probably
from his attorney.

30:45.822 --> 30:47.088
What did he want?

30:47.090 --> 30:48.556
He wanted to make a deal,

30:48.558 --> 30:51.375
and I was the only one
he would make it with.

31:06.324 --> 31:09.160
Can we be alone, please?

31:22.174 --> 31:23.674
What do you want?

31:23.676 --> 31:25.176
Nice to see you, too.

31:25.178 --> 31:27.344
Why am I here, Yates?

31:27.346 --> 31:28.745
I told you.

31:28.747 --> 31:30.731
I want to make a deal.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.301
You're on death row,

31:34.303 --> 31:38.639
not exactly a strong
negotiating position.

31:40.609 --> 31:43.760
I've got something
for you.

31:43.762 --> 31:45.762
It's a present.

31:45.764 --> 31:47.531
Open it.

31:47.533 --> 31:48.732
What is it?

31:48.734 --> 31:50.985
Open it and see.

31:54.122 --> 31:56.657
You shouldn't have.

32:00.445 --> 32:03.080
Surprise.

32:03.082 --> 32:06.083
Those are some
of the girls I took.

32:06.085 --> 32:09.720
The ones
you didn't find.

32:09.722 --> 32:12.373
There's 40 there.

32:16.428 --> 32:18.095
Why should I believe you?

32:18.097 --> 32:20.314
I thought
you might ask that.

32:20.316 --> 32:22.566
It's all
part of the deal.

32:22.568 --> 32:24.151
Look, let's get
something straight.

32:24.153 --> 32:25.486
There is no deal.

32:25.488 --> 32:26.487
Not yet.

32:26.489 --> 32:28.189
Not ever.

32:28.191 --> 32:31.642
There's actually
101 names.

32:31.644 --> 32:34.361
And I remember
all of them.

32:34.363 --> 32:37.414
And I'll tell you
where I put them.

32:37.416 --> 32:39.917
Here's what I want.

32:39.919 --> 32:42.536
One--no death penalty.

32:42.538 --> 32:44.872
I don't care
if I rot in here.

32:44.874 --> 32:47.675
But no chair
and no injections.

32:47.677 --> 32:51.045
2--I want a transfer
to the East Coast.

32:51.047 --> 32:54.131
Grandma's dead.
Nothing holding me here.

32:54.133 --> 32:59.553
Plus, I like the idea
of snow in the winter.

32:59.555 --> 33:01.672
Never really had that
growing up.

33:01.674 --> 33:05.943
I didn't come all this way
to get smoke blown up my ass.

33:05.945 --> 33:08.178
After I get my sentence
commuted

33:08.180 --> 33:09.813
and my transfer,

33:09.815 --> 33:11.649
I'll give you more names.

33:11.651 --> 33:13.701
But only one each year.

33:13.703 --> 33:16.487
To keep you honest.

33:16.489 --> 33:18.289
You understand.

33:19.857 --> 33:21.325
Anything else?

33:21.327 --> 33:23.210
Yes.

33:23.212 --> 33:26.964
I get to decide
when you get the name.

33:26.966 --> 33:30.501
It'll be on a special day
of my choosing.

33:30.503 --> 33:35.839
And you have to come
and get it from me personally.

33:35.841 --> 33:38.342
What do you say, Agent?

33:38.344 --> 33:41.428
Hmm?

33:41.430 --> 33:43.380
Deal?

33:47.102 --> 33:48.686
We checked the list
he gave us,

33:48.688 --> 33:50.237
and then we went out
to the locations

33:50.239 --> 33:52.106
where he said
he'd dumped the bodies,

33:52.108 --> 33:54.391
and we found all 40.

33:54.393 --> 33:57.394
Did you actually make a deal
with that maniac?

33:57.396 --> 33:59.396
We did.

33:59.398 --> 34:01.081
Not to bend to his will,

34:01.083 --> 34:04.368
but to bring the families
of the victims some peace.

34:04.370 --> 34:06.704
I'd been on the case
so long, I felt obligated

34:06.706 --> 34:09.706
to contact each
of the families personally.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.175
Mrs. Ruth Thomas?

34:13.460 --> 34:17.514
I'm Agent David Rossi
from the FBI.

34:17.516 --> 34:22.052
I have some information
about your daughter Sarah.

34:22.054 --> 34:25.723
I'm afraid I've got
bad news about Jessica...

34:30.110 --> 34:33.981
We found Chloe
two days ago in Griffith park.

34:36.652 --> 34:40.654
I can't tell you
how sorry I am for your loss.

34:46.962 --> 34:51.281
If I can do anything,
anything at all,

34:51.283 --> 34:54.284
please don't hesitate.

35:21.079 --> 35:25.482
Does it ever get hard
dealing with all that tragedy?

35:28.319 --> 35:29.787
You know, it's funny.

35:29.789 --> 35:32.656
Some cases, they end well,
so you can forget them.

35:32.658 --> 35:35.092
And some, like this one...

35:35.094 --> 35:37.494
they become a part of you.

35:37.496 --> 35:39.663
Dead kids.

35:39.665 --> 35:41.348
Mutilated bodies.

35:41.350 --> 35:42.999
It's all so horrible.

35:43.001 --> 35:44.835
How do you do it?

35:47.639 --> 35:52.059
Irish statesman and author
Edmund Burke once wrote,

35:52.061 --> 35:55.229
"The only thing necessary
for the triumph of evil

35:55.231 --> 35:58.198
is for good men
to do nothing."

35:59.401 --> 36:02.286
This job isn't
just what I do,

36:02.288 --> 36:04.288
it's who I am.

36:04.290 --> 36:06.123
Is it worth it?

36:06.125 --> 36:08.992
For every life we save?

36:08.994 --> 36:10.861
Damn right it is.

36:10.863 --> 36:12.413
Absolutely it's worth it.

36:12.415 --> 36:15.215
I can't imagine
doing anything else.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.837
Yes, Mr. Zimmerman.

36:19.839 --> 36:24.007
So, you have to go visit
this guy every year

36:24.009 --> 36:26.176
to get the name
of another victim.

36:26.178 --> 36:28.011
That's right.

36:28.114 --> 36:30.315
So what was the special day
of his choosing?

36:35.153 --> 36:37.255
You really don't want us
to go with you?

36:37.257 --> 36:38.423
It's no trouble at all.

36:38.425 --> 36:39.374
No, it's ok.

36:39.376 --> 36:41.426
Rossi, it's like
2 hours away.

36:41.428 --> 36:43.761
Come on, I can drive. I'll get
us there in less than an hour.

36:43.763 --> 36:44.829
I'm good, really.

36:44.831 --> 36:46.681
We could stop for dinner
on the way home.

36:46.683 --> 36:47.665
Stop.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.884
All of you.
I'll be fine.

36:49.886 --> 36:52.520
We'll see you
tomorrow.

36:52.522 --> 36:54.505
You bet.

36:57.342 --> 36:59.611
Ohh, is he gonna be ok?

36:59.613 --> 37:01.512
Of course he is.

37:01.514 --> 37:03.698
It's Rossi.

37:47.076 --> 37:49.110
Agent Rossi.

37:49.112 --> 37:52.113
I can't believe
it's been a year already.

37:52.115 --> 37:54.999
Time flies.

37:56.669 --> 37:59.621
Man, you must have
some serious juice.

37:59.623 --> 38:02.957
Thought for sure
we were gonna have to cancel.

38:02.959 --> 38:05.793
Riot in the yard,
tight-ass warden.

38:05.795 --> 38:09.781
Whole place
is locked down.

38:11.100 --> 38:14.385
Any plans for the big day?

38:16.972 --> 38:22.093
Come on. You should get out
and do something.

38:22.095 --> 38:24.696
Never know how many
of these you got left.

38:24.698 --> 38:26.197
What's her name?

38:26.199 --> 38:30.101
I used to hate birthdays
when I was a kid.

38:30.103 --> 38:32.587
That's why I like
celebrating yours.

38:32.589 --> 38:35.456
Her name.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.718
Took her in Eureka.

38:46.720 --> 38:50.388
Drove her out to the
Headwaters Forest Preserve

38:50.390 --> 38:52.740
up on Elk River Road.

38:53.792 --> 38:56.594
100 yards South of
the trailhead,

38:56.596 --> 38:59.931
put her under
a big old Sequoia.

39:14.864 --> 39:17.665
Open gate 241.

39:25.158 --> 39:29.711
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

39:30.997 --> 39:36.500
