massive physics experiments.

27:24.181 --> 27:28.150
In 2015, the experiments
on the Large Hadron Collider

27:28.185 --> 27:30.752
generated over
40 petabytes worth of data.

27:30.788 --> 27:34.390
That's 40 million
gigabytes worth of data,

27:34.425 --> 27:38.894
and who knows what discoveries and
impacts on our lives will come

27:38.930 --> 27:41.296
from the sifting
through of the data

27:41.331 --> 27:43.565
to discover things
like dark matter

27:43.600 --> 27:47.436
and the fundamental forces and
particles that make up our universe.

27:47.471 --> 27:49.438
♪ ♪

27:58.648 --> 28:01.416
There's really no better
driver of innovation

28:01.451 --> 28:04.685
than just asking really,
really big hard questions.

28:04.720 --> 28:09.157
We use image analysis software
to see galaxies or stars,

28:09.192 --> 28:11.759
and now
you use them to fight cancer.

28:11.794 --> 28:15.763
And my question is, how do I
understand dark energy better?

28:15.798 --> 28:19.032
Somebody, maybe,
will use that knowledge

28:19.068 --> 28:22.803
and develop something different
that makes our lives better.

28:29.178 --> 28:33.447
Wilson: <i>It's in the DNA of our
species to explore new frontiers.</i>

28:33.482 --> 28:35.048
<i>This exploration of the unknown</i>

28:35.084 --> 28:38.085
<i>is responsible for the
success of our species,</i>

28:38.120 --> 28:40.587
<i>and by better
understanding our universe,</i>

28:40.622 --> 28:44.124
<i>we empower ourselves
to solve the problems we face,</i>

28:44.159 --> 28:46.826
<i>and propel ourselves
into the stars.</i>

28:49.130 --> 28:51.130
Science is never finished.

28:51.165 --> 28:54.400
When you have new observations
that show you something else,

28:54.435 --> 28:56.803
then you have to modify
your picture.

28:59.941 --> 29:01.273
<i>Science will go on forever.</i>

29:01.309 --> 29:04.076
Cause there's always something
new to discover. That's right.
