You took all those classes
in one semester?

00:18.083 --> 00:20.250
Yes. Heh.

00:20.291 --> 00:23.250
My textbooks that fall
cost as much as a small car.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.250
But I wanted to graduate
in three and a half years,

00:26.291 --> 00:28.041
and I was interested
in all of them.

it's your brother.

Sam.
What do they have her on?

00:50.208 --> 00:52.000
She was deranged
when she came in.

So...

01:02.875 --> 01:05.500
It was actually...
It's actually a physical book?

01:05.542 --> 01:07.917
Yeah, yeah, with every
student's face in it.

01:07.959 --> 01:11.041
Like a phone book?
No computer?

01:11.083 --> 01:14.041
That's right,
young man.

01:15.625 --> 01:16.917
Yeah, it was great.

01:16.959 --> 01:19.041
You could look up
the cute guy

01:19.083 --> 01:21.875
in your Comparative
Literature class

01:21.917 --> 01:24.875
and call him
when you were drunk.

01:24.917 --> 01:27.000
What cute guy?
How cute?

01:29.291 --> 01:30.458
Not as cute as you.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.208
I'm not cute. I'm tough.
You're cute.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.250
I'm a tough guy.

01:38.917 --> 01:41.875
Sorry I called.
No, no, I'm glad you called.

01:41.917 --> 01:43.875
I'm--

01:43.917 --> 01:46.500
I'm sorry I don't have
any words of wisdom. I--

01:47.709 --> 01:49.041
Yeah.

01:49.083 --> 01:52.875
Gosh, you look so sad.
You look like a little boy.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.458
It's 20 years,
Addison.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.667
Just picked up
and left.

01:56.709 --> 01:58.875
No goodbye. No--

01:58.917 --> 02:01.125
She was just gone.
I know.

02:01.166 --> 02:03.500
I mean, I don't know. I
know what you told me.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.959
No call, no letter.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.166
I thought she was dead.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.041
Yeah, but it's good news,
right?

02:09.083 --> 02:11.458
That she's not.
That she's back now.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.208
Corinne.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.041
Can I get you
something?

02:17.083 --> 02:18.750
Thirsty.

02:19.917 --> 02:22.041
Hi, Corinne.
Um--

02:22.083 --> 02:24.500
I'm Sam's neighbor.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.959
And we work together also.
I'm Addison.

02:29.792 --> 02:32.000
( soft theme playing )

02:34.083 --> 02:36.000
Here's your water,
Corinne.

02:41.792 --> 02:44.000
Here are your meds.
Want to take these for me?

03:00.083 --> 03:02.208
I'm not so sure.

03:02.250 --> 03:06.750
Not so sure...?
That this is good news.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.333
( crying )

03:08.375 --> 03:10.583
He won't stop
screaming.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.834
I know babies cry,
but it's been like 14 hours.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.583
He won't eat.
He can't sleep.

03:14.625 --> 03:17.375
Hyperactive reflexes,
increased muscle tone.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.250
He's tachypneic.
Pulse ox is borderline.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.041
Can't you give him something?
PETE: We will.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.834
After we diagnose
what the problem is.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.458
COOPER:
Eli's pretty small for ten days.

03:24.500 --> 03:25.792
Was he premature?

03:26.834 --> 03:29.583
Mm-hm.
How many weeks?

03:29.625 --> 03:32.375
Um, like two?
Are you asking me?

03:32.417 --> 03:35.041
No, sorry.
It's just the screaming.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.041
I haven't slept.
Two weeks.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.583
He came two weeks early.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.333
He looks malnourished
and dehydrated.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.041
Is he eating?
Are you breast feeding?

03:43.083 --> 03:45.875
No. Um, uh--
He likes the bottle.

03:45.917 --> 03:47.291
Pumping or formula?
Formula.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.583
COOPER:
And why is that?

03:49.625 --> 03:50.875
What?

03:50.917 --> 03:54.041
Uh, most mothers try
to breast feed for a while.

03:54.083 --> 03:55.583
Was he having trouble
latching?

03:55.625 --> 03:57.875
Why does it matter?
Just help him.

03:59.667 --> 04:04.000
You look good for someone
who gave birth ten days ago.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.083
This isn't your baby,
is it?

04:19.083 --> 04:21.875
Okay, you need to explain
what's going on right now,

04:21.917 --> 04:24.125
or we're going to Security.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.333
Okay.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.625
Wait.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.041
Uh, his mom...

04:30.083 --> 04:33.041
My mom.
She's a druggie.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.917
So Eli is your brother?

04:34.959 --> 04:36.250
She gave birth to him,

04:36.291 --> 04:39.041
brought him home
and then left to score.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.458
He was two days old.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.208
But it's been over a week,
and she hasn't come back.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.208
Did you try to find her?
No, but--

04:45.250 --> 04:48.458
Do you know if she's okay?
I never know if she's okay.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
The first time she left me,
I was 8.

04:50.542 --> 04:52.792
I woke up one morning,
went downstairs

04:52.834 --> 04:54.125
and there was no one.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.041
The house was empty.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.709
I didn't know what to do
and I was scared,

04:58.750 --> 05:01.959
but I didn't wanna be alone,
so I toasted a frozen waffle

05:02.000 --> 05:03.959
and I got dressed
and I went to school.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.375
She came back
a few days later.

05:06.417 --> 05:09.041
She said
she got stuck at work.

05:09.083 --> 05:12.750
But she worked in some office,
and it didn't make any sense.

05:12.792 --> 05:18.375
But then she acted normal,
so I did too. I just...

05:18.417 --> 05:20.291
I didn't want it
to happen again.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.500
But it did?
DENISE: Of course.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.625
Sometimes she would tell me
that she was leaving,

05:24.667 --> 05:27.959
other times
she'd just be gone.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.750
Eventually,
when it got really bad,

05:30.792 --> 05:33.083
one of my teachers
figured it out.

05:33.125 --> 05:38.333
And that was the first time
I was put in foster care.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.834
After that...

05:40.834 --> 05:44.291
It was just
a lot of back and forth.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.834
Eli doesn't deserve that.

05:46.875 --> 05:50.375
He should have someone
who can take care of him.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.125
Always.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.166
And that can be me.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.041
( chattering )

06:04.083 --> 06:05.417
Hey.

06:05.458 --> 06:07.417
How are you feeling?
Hey.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.834
Ten minutes into
my first session of chemo.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.834
Probably better
than anyone else in here.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.417
CHARLOTTE:
You got the right attitude.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.041
Do you want to bring Mason in?
No.

06:17.083 --> 06:20.041
I don't want him to see me.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.000
Or anyone else in here.

06:23.041 --> 06:25.041
It'd just be
too much for him.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.417
Okay.

06:27.458 --> 06:30.250
If that's what you want.
It's what I want.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.667
He's my little boy.

06:32.709 --> 06:35.166
I've been the only constant
in his life.

06:35.208 --> 06:40.291
So if this is scary for me,
then for him...

06:42.625 --> 06:43.834
( chuckles )

06:45.083 --> 06:47.208
It's what I want.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.041
( sighs )

06:49.083 --> 06:53.041
Blank-O-O-blank
blank-I-blank-blank.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.417
Come on.

06:55.458 --> 07:01.208
I don't know, E?
I already said there's no E's.

07:01.250 --> 07:05.542
Can I please see my mom now?
In a few minutes. She's resting.

07:05.583 --> 07:08.500
I really just wanna see my mom.
I know.

07:08.542 --> 07:09.750
Hey, guys.
COOPER: Hey, man.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.542
JAKE:
Hey, Mason.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.458
So...

07:13.500 --> 07:15.667
How's your, uh...?

07:20.166 --> 07:21.625
Give me a minute, okay?

07:21.667 --> 07:23.667
I'll give you a hint.
There's a K in there.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.041
Mason doesn't know
about his mother?

07:28.083 --> 07:30.041
No, Erica won't...

07:30.083 --> 07:32.041
Doesn't want me
to say anything, you know.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.875
I've gone along,
because he's just a kid,

07:33.917 --> 07:35.917
he's not ready to deal
with his mother's death.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.083
I'm not ready
to deal with it.

07:37.125 --> 07:40.041
Yeah. Losing a parent.
I know how hard that is.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.375
At least he has
you and Charlotte.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.667
Yeah. Yeah.

07:42.709 --> 07:43.917
( phone chimes )

07:43.959 --> 07:45.417
JAKE:
Mason. I'll see you later.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.500
All right. Any ideas?

07:51.542 --> 07:53.375
Why's my mom
resting so much?

07:53.417 --> 07:55.083
She's still really tired
from the accident.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.166
The last time I saw her,
she didn't look tired.

07:57.208 --> 07:58.458
She looked fine.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.041
Yeah, but--
I know she wants to see me.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.458
And I really wanna
see her.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.667
Please.

08:05.709 --> 08:09.125
We just have to give her
a little more time.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.417
( woman speaking indistinctly
over PA )

08:14.458 --> 08:17.583
Hey, can I ask you a favor?
You can ask.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.417
I want you to take me off
the surgical rotation

08:19.458 --> 08:21.500
for a couple of days.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.291
I'm researching gliosarcomas
and I have a few leads,

08:24.333 --> 08:25.542
but I need more time.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.041
Erica agreed
to do the chemo.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.125
Beyond that, I don't think
she's holding out any hope.

08:29.166 --> 08:32.792
Which is realistic.
But I'm not ready to give up.

08:32.834 --> 08:35.041
What does that mean?
It means I need to keep reading

08:35.083 --> 08:37.333
and talking
to more docs and...

08:37.375 --> 08:39.166
I don't know where you find
miracles these days,

08:39.208 --> 08:40.458
but I would like to try.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.625
Okay.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.041
You were right.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.458
Baby Eli has neonatal
abstinence syndrome.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.417
We should start
a methadone taper.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.000
Unfortunately,
there's more.

08:56.041 --> 08:59.041
He's also got a congenital
cystic adenomatoid malformation.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.792
It needs to be removed, or
his lungs will be compromised.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.041
You can't do surgery.
He's too weak.

09:04.083 --> 09:05.583
Waiting carries its own risks.

09:05.625 --> 09:09.041
Any little virus or cold,
he could become oxygen-deprived.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.750
COOPER:
Who makes this call?

09:10.792 --> 09:12.542
Well, is there a father
in the picture?

09:12.583 --> 09:14.625
No, just the baby's sister,
Denise.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.041
How old is she?
Nineteen.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.041
And she also went through hell
with the mother,

09:18.083 --> 09:21.041
but she's trying to do right
by her brother.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.500
You think she's qualified
to make that kind of decision?

09:23.542 --> 09:25.208
PETE:
She doesn't have to.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.000
This is Eli's mother,
Melissa.

09:34.083 --> 09:37.041
Did I leave to score drugs
right after Eli was born?

09:37.083 --> 09:39.917
Yes, I did.
But I changed my mind.

09:39.959 --> 09:42.208
Oh. So where were you?
Getting clean.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.041
You went to rehab?
No. I did it myself.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.041
She locked herself
in a motel room for eight days

09:46.083 --> 09:48.041
and detoxed cold turkey.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.250
That would've been great before
she got her fetus addicted.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.041
Okay, Cooper.
MELISSA: You're right.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.458
But I got clean.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.875
You've been clean for,
what, eight days?

09:55.917 --> 09:58.542
You've been an addict for--
Don't tell me about addiction.

09:58.583 --> 10:01.250
I am trying for Eli.
I am doing everything I can.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.125
Because I am gonna be
a good mother to him.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.291
You walked out on him.
MELISSA: No, I didn't.

10:05.333 --> 10:09.250
I left him with Denise.
And I called over and over.

10:09.291 --> 10:12.041
Only Denise never answered,
and she never called me back.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.291
COOPER:
So Denise is lying?

10:13.333 --> 10:15.291
She has issues.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.834
With me, all right?
And I know why.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.667
Lots of times, I wasn't
any kind of mother to her.

10:19.709 --> 10:22.959
But this is not
the same thing. It isn't.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.041
I went to get clean.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.041
It was miserable.
I...

10:28.083 --> 10:31.375
Day after day, shaking
and sweating and wanting to die,

10:31.417 --> 10:33.709
but I did it for Eli
because he is my second chance,

10:33.750 --> 10:36.125
and I am not gonna
screw this up.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.542
How did you find her?

10:39.583 --> 10:41.166
I called
her cell phone.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.500
Okay, so what? She left
her newborn to get high.

10:43.542 --> 10:44.709
But she didn't get high.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.458
She got clean,
and that means something.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
You know how hard it is
to detox cold turkey.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.959
Yeah. And it was admirable
she was able to do it.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.750
Does that mean she's able
to take care of Eli?

10:53.792 --> 10:55.166
Denise is.
She's a kid.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.542
Really? Does Denise
have an apartment, a job,

10:57.583 --> 10:59.542
somebody to help?
There are plenty of single,

10:59.583 --> 11:01.583
competent teenaged mothers
in the world.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.041
With a sick baby?
Okay, guys. You know what?

11:04.083 --> 11:06.750
We're not gonna solve this.
We gotta call DCFS.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.333
Melissa's better
than the system.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.709
Denise is better
than Melissa.

11:09.750 --> 11:13.041
I am calling
Social Services.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.000
( soft theme playing )

11:18.083 --> 11:19.959
( knock on door )

11:20.000 --> 11:21.625
AMELIA:
Hey.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.542
How do you feel
about New Zealand?

11:23.583 --> 11:25.000
( chuckles )

11:25.041 --> 11:27.750
Anything farther than
the bathroom seems intimidating.

11:27.792 --> 11:29.417
Why?
There's a doctor there

11:29.458 --> 11:31.667
who's doing experimental
treatments on gliosarcomas.

11:31.709 --> 11:33.959
They're called
intracranial microcapsules,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.041
which basically just means
they're these--

11:36.083 --> 11:38.041
No.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.750
Thank you, but no.

11:39.792 --> 11:43.417
I can't get on a plane
and fly halfway around the world

11:43.458 --> 11:46.041
for whatever that is.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.583
It might be nothing.
But it might be something.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.041
And the point is,
we won't know

11:50.083 --> 11:52.041
until we get on the ground
and really start--

11:52.083 --> 11:54.667
Amelia, I agreed to do chemo.
I'm fighting.

11:54.709 --> 11:57.875
I don't wanna do anything
to sacrifice time with Mason.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.417
Especially getting on a plane
to fly somewhere

12:00.458 --> 12:02.250
for someone to do surgery
on my brain.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.792
A surgery
that I might not wake up from.

12:04.834 --> 12:08.000
I'm sorry, I can't.

12:10.542 --> 12:13.000
( soft theme playing )

12:30.083 --> 12:31.291
Three times.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.625
Three times?
Ugh, I hate you.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.041
Yes, well,
I would hate me too. Ha, ha.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.333
Look at you.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.625
You're all
"Violet got her groove back."

12:40.667 --> 12:43.041
Yes.
Who would've thought

12:43.083 --> 12:44.917
my groove was in this
20-something paramedic

12:44.959 --> 12:48.041
with these abs carved out
of marble and this back...

12:48.083 --> 12:50.208
Oh my God, his back.
It's just like you ordered him.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.291
Like you called a catalog and
asked for those specifications.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.667
I want that catalog.
I've never done this before.

12:55.709 --> 12:59.250
It's just sex. It's just
pure, mind-numbing sex.

12:59.291 --> 13:02.834
Maybe guys are right. Maybe
"no strings attached" works.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.333
Eh, every time
I sleep with someone,

13:04.375 --> 13:06.041
we wind up
in a pit of despair.

13:06.083 --> 13:09.041
Ha-ha-ha.
Together. Stuck.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.625
Stop.
I'm serious.

13:10.667 --> 13:14.917
All this makes me miss Sam.
You miss Sam or you miss sex?

13:14.959 --> 13:17.333
Both. You know,
the irony has been

13:17.375 --> 13:19.542
that the harder I tried
to have a baby,

13:19.583 --> 13:21.041
the less I actually had sex.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.375
It's been months.

13:22.417 --> 13:25.083
Which is probably
why I threw myself at Jake.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.041
What?
Heh, heh. In Palm Springs.

13:29.083 --> 13:32.458
I drank a bunch of martinis,
and I wind up in his bed.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.583
Addison.
He turned me down.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.667
You know, which I respect.
And hate.

13:37.709 --> 13:40.500
Ugh. I miss Sam.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.417
( scoffs )

13:47.458 --> 13:49.959
Lazy.
What?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.625
Lazy. It's lazy.
It's more than lazy.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.333
You know, it's infuriating.
Sheldon.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.542
She's stoned, Sam.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.333
She's not medicated,
not even diagnosed.

13:57.375 --> 14:01.041
I understand the pressure
the prison shrinks are under.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.375
But your sister
is just stoned on a cocktail

14:03.417 --> 14:05.166
of anti-psychotics
and sedatives

14:05.208 --> 14:10.542
that would leave a circus animal
glassy-eyed and affect-less.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.166
( sighs )

14:13.208 --> 14:15.542
Okay, look, there might be
a silver lining here, okay?

14:15.583 --> 14:18.000
We don't know what Corinne
is like under all those meds.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.000
And once we get her off them,
you might actually

14:20.041 --> 14:22.166
be able to find your sister
in there somewhere.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.583
You wanna take her off her meds?
Yeah.

14:24.625 --> 14:26.667
The prison guard said
she was deranged.

14:26.709 --> 14:29.375
Deranged
is not a diagnosis.

14:29.417 --> 14:31.417
I just wanna get her
off the meds long enough

14:31.458 --> 14:36.792
to see what's going on with her.
Okay? Can we do that?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.041
Please.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.041
Okay.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.625
So Sheldon
took her off her meds?

14:48.667 --> 14:50.750
Yeah. Temporarily.

14:50.792 --> 14:53.000
Well, did she...?

14:53.041 --> 14:55.417
Is she any different?

14:55.458 --> 14:59.041
Uh, not much. Not yet.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.041
Apparently they had her
pretty zonked out.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.000
I'm gonna have to wait
for it all to wear off,

15:03.041 --> 15:05.709
but Sheldon canceled
all his patients.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.083
Said he would
spend the day with her.

15:07.125 --> 15:11.250
Try to make a real diagnosis.
And then what?

15:13.875 --> 15:15.041
I don't know.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.834
Uh... I just...

15:18.875 --> 15:20.250
I don't know.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.458
Did you call your family?
Your mom?

15:23.500 --> 15:28.834
No. I've been taking this thing,
like, a minute at a time.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.709
I mean, I can't look ahead.
I just...

15:32.083 --> 15:33.500
I don't know.

15:38.542 --> 15:41.542
It's not your job anymore,
you know?

15:41.583 --> 15:45.333
To take care of him.
To worry about him.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.041
He's my friend.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.709
He'll be your friend
again someday,

15:48.750 --> 15:52.041
but right now
he's mostly just your ex.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.709
I mean, you still want
a baby, right?

15:54.750 --> 15:57.041
I know you needed a break,
but has anything changed?

15:57.083 --> 15:58.917
No. I still want a baby.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.041
Then right now,
Sam is your ex.

16:01.083 --> 16:04.291
You try to pretend
he's your friend and, uh...

16:04.333 --> 16:06.250
And what?
And you hurt worse.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.083
I know he's having
a tough time right now,

16:08.125 --> 16:10.959
but he has
other friends and...

16:12.959 --> 16:15.291
And I would hate to see
you hurt worse.

16:19.291 --> 16:21.083
I gotta go
to the hospital.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.917
I'm-- I'm putting
my foot down.

16:27.959 --> 16:29.458
We're staying on the bed
next time.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.041
Why?

16:31.083 --> 16:34.542
I'm gonna die
from rug burn, that's why.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.792
Why do we have
to lie down at all?

16:36.834 --> 16:37.959
You're trouble.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.792
Oh. You kids
got a hall pass?

16:46.667 --> 16:49.166
I'm the only one
you have to worry about.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.291
( machine beeping )

16:59.333 --> 17:00.709
Should I...?

17:00.750 --> 17:04.083
Um, if I brought him
in earlier, would he be okay?

17:04.125 --> 17:07.166
Oh. Denise,
it is not your fault.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.000
DENISE:
I just want to protect him.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.041
COOPER:
I know you do.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.875
Why are you here?
She wants to be with her baby.

17:14.917 --> 17:17.041
Honey, Mommy's here, Eli,

17:17.083 --> 17:19.041
and I am never
leaving again, ever.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.542
Liar.
You're a liar.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.250
You're gonna do to him
what you did to me.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.375
He is gonna end up like I did,
No.

17:25.417 --> 17:27.250
bouncing around,
scared and alone.

17:27.291 --> 17:30.000
I am clean now, okay?
You can't do this here.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.208
Oh, right.
Until Eli cries

17:32.250 --> 17:34.667
or you have a bad day at work
or some guy dumps you,

17:34.709 --> 17:36.041
that's all
it's gonna take.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.208
Look, I will not let you
hurt him.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.041
You are damaged
and you are bad--

17:40.083 --> 17:43.500
I have a problem, okay?
You need to go outside.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.625
For the first time,
I have a reason to fix it.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.166
Oh, so I wasn't worth it?

17:47.208 --> 17:48.417
( machine beeping rapidly )

17:48.458 --> 17:49.875
MELISSA:
Oh, my God. What is it?

17:49.917 --> 17:51.834
Get Dr. Montgomery.
What is happening?

17:51.875 --> 17:53.417
Sats are dropping.
What does that mean?

17:53.458 --> 17:54.834
He's having trouble breathing.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.041
PETE: Intubate.
ADDISON: Don't. Don't.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.458
He's not getting air.
We have to.

17:58.500 --> 18:02.041
Intubating will increase
air-trapping into the lungs.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.834
We need to get him
to the OR now.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.291
Dr. Freedman said he's not
strong enough for surgery.

18:06.333 --> 18:09.041
MELISSA: Let them do their job.
You don't know.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.834
The surgery might kill him,
but not doing surgery will.

18:11.875 --> 18:14.709
Enough!
Move out of the way. Now!

18:14.750 --> 18:16.750
( tense theme playing )

18:23.792 --> 18:25.875
( in high-pitched voice ):
"I don't wanna die."

18:25.917 --> 18:27.083
( in deep voice ):
"But you must die!"

18:27.125 --> 18:28.500
( Mason roars )

18:28.542 --> 18:31.875
All right, time for all monsters
to get off the table.

18:31.917 --> 18:34.041
Dinner is ready.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.333
( in normal voice ):
I'm not hungry.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.875
I just wanna see my mom.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.709
I made you mac and cheese.
That's your favorite, right?

18:39.750 --> 18:42.083
Charlotte, I really just
wanna see my mom.

18:42.125 --> 18:43.917
I know you do.

18:43.959 --> 18:45.834
But visiting hours are over
for tonight.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.583
But you're in charge there,
you can take me.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.000
( sighs )

18:50.041 --> 18:52.166
Your mom's still resting.
She's not this tired.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.041
Everyone keeps saying that,
but she's never this tired.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.875
Tell me what you think
of the mac and cheese.

18:56.917 --> 19:00.583
This isn't right.
It's not how my mom makes it.

19:00.625 --> 19:03.291
Well, there's macaroni
and there's cheese.

19:03.333 --> 19:07.208
I don't want this.
I want to see my mom.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.041
( Charlotte sighs )

19:12.083 --> 19:15.041
CHARLOTTE:
I know you're upset
and you've been through a lot,

19:15.083 --> 19:16.875
and you're worried
about your mom.

19:16.917 --> 19:19.959
But that does not mean
that you can act like...

19:22.083 --> 19:23.583
Mason?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.834
Mason.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.000
Mason!

19:36.542 --> 19:38.542
( whirring )

19:48.458 --> 19:50.792
Thank you. How's Eli?

19:50.834 --> 19:52.333
COOPER:
Addison's still working on him.

19:52.375 --> 19:56.583
Isolated the main bronchus,
but hasn't done the lobectomy.

19:56.625 --> 20:00.291
But that kid's a fighter.
I think he'll do okay.

20:04.083 --> 20:07.750
Hey, man, I know we disagree
about Melissa and Denise,

20:07.792 --> 20:10.041
but let's not let it
become a thing, okay?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.458
It's not a thing.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.875
You sure?
I was just... Look.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.542
My mind's on Eli,
I'm walking down the hall,

20:17.583 --> 20:19.542
and I see Violet making out
with her boyfriend.

20:19.583 --> 20:20.792
Oh.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.333
It's annoying.
Yeah, well...

20:23.375 --> 20:25.458
Yeah, well, heh, what?

20:25.500 --> 20:27.875
I mean, you guys
are separated, right?

20:27.917 --> 20:29.583
Doesn't mean I wanna
see her fooling around

20:29.625 --> 20:32.375
with someone I have to work with
in my workplace.

20:32.417 --> 20:36.083
Heh. You might not want to, but
isn't that the next step?

20:36.125 --> 20:38.000
I mean, you move on,
she moves on.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.417
Okay. Let's just say
you and Charlotte split up,

20:41.458 --> 20:43.917
she starts dating
some hot male nurse.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.291
Ha-ha-ha.
Would you be cool with that

20:45.333 --> 20:47.333
just because you had
a few nights of fun?

20:48.750 --> 20:51.583
I don't know how I would feel.
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, you do.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.458
( cell phone chimes )

20:54.500 --> 20:56.291
Ah, speak of the devil.
Hello?

20:56.333 --> 20:58.083
I turned my back
for one second, Coop.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.709
One second,
and he was gone.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.917
COOPER: What?
CHARLOTTE: Mason.

21:01.959 --> 21:04.083
What? Where are you?
He ran out the front door,

21:04.125 --> 21:05.875
and now I'm out
looking for him.

21:05.917 --> 21:07.917
How long has he been gone,
how far did he get?

21:07.959 --> 21:10.834
I'm trying to figure that out.
Okay, I'm calling the police.

21:10.875 --> 21:13.542
Give me five minutes.
If I can't find him, I'll call.

21:13.583 --> 21:16.041
Are you feeling better?

21:16.083 --> 21:17.792
Clearer?

21:20.583 --> 21:23.208
A little.

21:23.250 --> 21:26.166
Corinne, have you ever been
formally diagnosed?

21:27.542 --> 21:30.250
Schizophrenic.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.500
Manic-depressive.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.959
Paranoid delusions.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.041
Every jail,
every nuthouse,

21:40.083 --> 21:44.000
a different shrink
had a different idea.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.750
I'm thirsty.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.583
You're just coming down
off the haloperidol.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.208
Here, have some water.

21:56.417 --> 21:59.500
Yeah, Sam, come in.
Okay. Hey, Corinne.

21:59.542 --> 22:02.041
SHELDON:
Corinne has given me permission
to include you

22:02.083 --> 22:04.291
and disclose
what she's sharing.

22:04.333 --> 22:08.000
Isn't that right, Corinne?
Mm-hm. Sure.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.542
Bathroom?
SHELDON: Sure, sure.

22:15.583 --> 22:19.834
It's out the door, down the hall
on the right. Okay? Easy.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.000
Yeah. Thank you.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.625
( sighs )

22:33.667 --> 22:35.000
( door closes )

22:35.041 --> 22:37.041
I was wondering
what you remember.

22:37.083 --> 22:39.417
You grew up with Corinne.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.000
For purposes of diagnosis.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.583
( sighs )

22:43.625 --> 22:46.333
What I remember.

22:46.375 --> 22:52.041
Uh, okay.
I remember her being,

22:52.083 --> 22:53.375
you know,
the life of the party.

22:53.417 --> 22:58.041
Until she was
the death of it.

22:58.083 --> 23:00.750
Can you explain that?
Uh, she was wild.

23:00.792 --> 23:04.041
She was wild.
She was funny, she was loud.

23:04.083 --> 23:07.041
Always dancing on tables.

23:07.083 --> 23:11.583
Until she would fall off
the tables. She, um...

23:11.625 --> 23:13.041
( chuckles )

23:13.083 --> 23:14.375
She almost
burned the house down.

23:14.417 --> 23:17.041
Intentionally?
No, she was...

23:17.083 --> 23:20.709
She said she was making popcorn.
The oil caught fire.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.917
I remember her saying
she thought it looked cool,

23:23.959 --> 23:27.041
so instead of trying
to put the fire out,

23:27.083 --> 23:30.750
she started fanning the flames
to make it bigger.

23:32.250 --> 23:34.792
Luckily, I knew where
the fire extinguisher was.

23:34.834 --> 23:37.875
Was she drunk or high?
I never could tell.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.917
You know, she was just...

23:39.959 --> 23:41.041
She was just wild.

23:41.083 --> 23:43.500
( tender folk music
playing )

23:43.542 --> 23:45.125
And then...

23:48.250 --> 23:49.750
And then what?

23:49.792 --> 23:51.542
And then she would turn.

23:51.583 --> 23:55.000
All of a sudden, she would think
the world was against her.

23:56.291 --> 23:58.125
I put out her fire,
like, literally.

23:58.166 --> 24:01.750
I stopped her from burning down
the house and...

24:01.792 --> 24:04.041
And?
And she cried

24:04.083 --> 24:07.208
for like three days straight.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.917
She, uh...
She threatened suicide.

24:09.959 --> 24:13.291
She accused me
of hating her and...

24:14.500 --> 24:16.792
of wanting her dead.

24:19.083 --> 24:22.291
She was not easy
to live with.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.458
She's my sister
and I love her,

24:29.500 --> 24:33.208
but when you say
that she's in there somewhere...

24:35.125 --> 24:37.000
I don't know how I feel
about that.

24:40.917 --> 24:42.375
Look, it's been
a long day.

24:42.417 --> 24:44.792
Do you mind
if I just take her home,

24:44.834 --> 24:46.000
and we can continue
tomorrow?

24:46.041 --> 24:48.041
Sure.
All right. Thanks.

24:48.083 --> 24:49.625
I appreciate this.
Uh-huh.

24:58.625 --> 25:02.041
Coop, I found him.

25:21.875 --> 25:25.291
You know, when I was
a little older than you are,

25:25.333 --> 25:27.083
my cousins
used to go

25:27.125 --> 25:30.041
hang out at the river
with their friends.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.959
And I was
just desperate to go.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.667
But every time I asked
my daddy, he said no.

25:35.709 --> 25:37.041
I wasn't old enough.

25:37.083 --> 25:40.000
So one weekend
I snuck out.

25:40.041 --> 25:44.667
Hitched a ride and went to see
what all the fuss was about.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.041
And you know what?
My daddy was right.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.375
It was just
a whole lot of...

25:50.709 --> 25:53.041
Well, big kid stuff.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.125
That I wasn't ready for.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.875
So, what I'm trying
to tell you is,

25:58.917 --> 26:01.917
sometimes, when
you really wanna do something--

26:01.959 --> 26:03.750
Is my mom dead?

26:05.500 --> 26:09.041
Because no one's
letting me see her.

26:09.083 --> 26:11.667
When my nana
went into the hospital,

26:13.083 --> 26:15.000
she never came out.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.333
Oh, honey.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.208
( knocking on door )

26:36.250 --> 26:37.500
Hey.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.250
Oh, hey.

26:40.667 --> 26:44.041
What's up?
Nothing. I, uh...

26:44.083 --> 26:46.625
Well, I saved a baby today.

26:46.667 --> 26:49.333
Oh. Well, that's good,
you know.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.041
I was at home, I couldn't sleep
and I saw your light on.

26:52.083 --> 26:56.041
I wanted to, you know,
make sure you were okay.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.041
( romantic theme playing )

27:03.083 --> 27:05.083
( both moaning )

27:07.000 --> 27:09.375
Where's Corinne?
She's asleep.

27:09.417 --> 27:10.792
Yeah?

27:20.083 --> 27:22.083
I'm sorry.
How did Charlotte lose Mason?

27:22.125 --> 27:23.875
Mason was very upset,

27:23.917 --> 27:26.125
and he just slipped out the door
when she wasn't looking.

27:26.166 --> 27:29.041
I need to see him.
Okay, Charlotte's bringing him.

27:29.083 --> 27:32.083
Now.
Mom!

27:34.625 --> 27:35.875
I thought you were dead.

27:35.917 --> 27:39.041
ERICA:
I'm not. Of course I'm not.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.333
Are you gonna be okay?

27:41.375 --> 27:45.625
Yes, baby.
Mommy's gonna be just fine.

27:49.083 --> 27:52.000
( soft theme playing )

28:00.834 --> 28:04.542
Unh. Hey.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.917
Hey.

28:06.959 --> 28:09.750
You don't have to leave,
you know.

28:09.792 --> 28:14.291
Nothing's changed, Sam.
I mean...

28:14.333 --> 28:18.250
Nothing's changed.
So... Unh.

28:18.291 --> 28:20.667
I do have to go.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.041
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

28:26.083 --> 28:27.750
No, no, don't be sorry.

28:27.792 --> 28:32.041
I'm not sorry.
I just have to go.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.250
I'm gonna check on you too.
I'm worried about you.

28:34.291 --> 28:37.875
I wish I could say
you didn't have to be,

28:39.083 --> 28:42.583
but honestly,
I'm worried about me too.

28:55.917 --> 28:57.917
( machine beeping )

29:00.083 --> 29:02.834
( woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a. )

29:08.625 --> 29:10.041
You don't like me
very much.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.041
Uh, well,
I don't really know you.

29:13.083 --> 29:16.166
Only thing I know about you
is the first thing you did

29:16.208 --> 29:20.792
after your baby was born
was leave to get high, so...

29:20.834 --> 29:25.083
I was jonesing,
he was screaming. I...

29:25.125 --> 29:27.875
I had to get away and drugs
are how I've always done that.

29:27.917 --> 29:31.041
And now
it's gonna be different?

29:31.083 --> 29:34.625
How do I answer that?

29:34.667 --> 29:36.709
I wanna say yes.

29:36.750 --> 29:41.417
That I would die before I hurt
Eli the way I hurt Denise.

29:41.458 --> 29:44.667
But you're gonna tell me
I'm an addict and addicts slip.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.041
What do I say to that?
It's true.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.250
But this time,

29:50.291 --> 29:52.041
I'm gonna do everything I can
for that boy.

29:52.083 --> 29:55.709
Do you have any idea how lucky
you are to have that choice?

29:55.750 --> 29:57.667
Eli could have died
from the drugs you were doing

29:57.709 --> 29:59.041
when you were pregnant.

29:59.083 --> 30:01.041
His condition could have
killed him after he was born.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.041
DCFS could have taken him
when you were gone.

30:03.083 --> 30:05.375
You could have had
a bad reaction detoxing.

30:05.417 --> 30:09.542
Frankly, it is a miracle
you're both even here right now.

30:09.583 --> 30:10.792
And most parents...

30:12.417 --> 30:14.917
Believe me,
they don't get miracles.

30:14.959 --> 30:16.792
I know I screwed up.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.458
But I am making a choice.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.291
And this time
I am choosing Eli.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.625
Good. I hope so.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.542
Being a parent,
a good parent,

30:24.583 --> 30:27.333
that is an all day,
every day job.

30:27.375 --> 30:28.875
Every single day.

30:28.917 --> 30:32.041
I am not kidding myself.
I know it's going to be a fight.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.667
Every day,
like you said. And I'm...

30:36.083 --> 30:38.417
I'm gonna fight.
And what about Denise?

30:38.458 --> 30:41.583
Maybe-- I don't know.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.083
Maybe it's too late for us.
I don't know.

30:43.125 --> 30:46.041
I hope that it's not,
but I learned on Denise.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.917
And this time I'm gonna
do it right with Eli.

30:48.959 --> 30:50.291
I know
that I left once.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.208
And I'm sure
there is a better way

30:52.250 --> 30:55.083
to do what I had to do, but...

30:55.125 --> 30:57.625
At least this time, even though
I did the wrong thing,

30:57.667 --> 30:59.125
it was for the right reasons.

30:59.166 --> 31:01.000
It really was.

31:04.083 --> 31:08.125
I believe in second chances,
but I don't trust this woman.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.000
She's been sober
for eight days.

31:10.041 --> 31:12.458
That's not enough time,
not by a long shot, right?

31:12.500 --> 31:15.125
Maybe Melissa doesn't have
to raise Eli all by herself.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.041
You know,
maybe she can ask for help.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.166
Denise cares, right?

31:18.208 --> 31:20.041
She does, but, I mean,

31:20.083 --> 31:22.166
you should see
these two people together.

31:22.208 --> 31:24.333
Well, you should see
me and Pete together.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.000
But kids are
an exception.

31:26.041 --> 31:28.542
If there's one thing that Pete
and I agree on, it's Lucas.

31:28.583 --> 31:30.041
That's it? Just Lucas?

31:30.083 --> 31:33.959
If you're asking me
if it's over, I don't know.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.041
Back when we were together,
you know, Pete was an ass.

31:37.083 --> 31:41.583
And now
that we're apart, he's...

31:41.625 --> 31:43.583
He's actually more of an ass.
You know, he--

31:43.625 --> 31:44.792
Ha-ha-ha.

31:44.834 --> 31:47.041
No, he refuses
to let me be happy

31:47.083 --> 31:49.417
with anybody else.
Okay, but seeing you with Scott.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.125
That has gotta be
weird for him.

31:53.083 --> 31:54.834
What are you doing?
What do you mean?

31:54.875 --> 31:56.041
You're defending him.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.625
No, I get
where he's coming from.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.166
From a place
where he wants me miserable.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.667
No, he's hurt.
He's the one who wanted

32:01.709 --> 32:04.166
to see other people.
I hated the idea. I cried.

32:04.208 --> 32:07.041
I thought about it logically
and I thought, "Pete's right.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.875
"He wants to be happy.
I wanna be happy.

32:08.917 --> 32:10.834
And neither of us
should interfere with that."

32:10.875 --> 32:12.959
Aren't you interfering
by being in a relationship

32:13.000 --> 32:15.041
with somebody he works with?
The thing with Scott,

32:15.083 --> 32:17.834
it's not a relationship.
It's sex.

32:17.875 --> 32:20.083
It's exactly the same thing
that he's doing.

32:20.125 --> 32:23.667
The only difference is that
it's someone he sort of knows.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.041
And sometimes sees.

32:25.083 --> 32:29.917
But, Coop, it's...
It's not going anywhere.

32:29.959 --> 32:32.583
Well, maybe you should
tell Pete that.

32:50.208 --> 32:52.291
How long are you gonna
keep Mason in the dark?

32:54.083 --> 32:57.500
Well, you saw how he reacted
when he thought I...

33:03.583 --> 33:04.917
I can't tell him.

33:07.083 --> 33:10.041
With all due respect,

33:10.083 --> 33:13.041
last night, Mason dumped dinner
on the floor,

33:13.083 --> 33:16.041
ran out the door
and scared the hell out of me.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.625
Because he is worried
about you.

33:18.667 --> 33:22.041
Now, he's smart
and he needs some answers,

33:22.083 --> 33:23.417
and this is
only gonna get worse.

33:23.458 --> 33:26.000
If you don't tell him--

33:28.333 --> 33:30.041
He's never gonna
forgive you.

33:30.083 --> 33:32.917
And he'll hate
me and Cooper,

33:32.959 --> 33:35.166
the only people
he'll have left.

33:36.417 --> 33:38.583
Erica, I know
why you're lying to him.

33:40.417 --> 33:42.750
But you're lying to him.

33:50.250 --> 33:51.750
It's too much.

33:51.792 --> 33:54.125
I can't tell him.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.583
( sobbing ):
Not yet.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.083
I just can't.

34:08.375 --> 34:12.750
I told you Eli was a fighter.
So is his mother.

34:12.792 --> 34:14.041
What is it
with you and Melissa?

34:14.083 --> 34:15.250
From the very get-go,

34:15.291 --> 34:18.125
you've just been on her side.
Violet abandoned Lucas.

34:18.166 --> 34:19.792
Is that really
what's bothering you?

34:19.834 --> 34:21.041
It was a big deal.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.166
Nothing to do with
who Violet's sleeping with.

34:23.208 --> 34:26.458
Look, when she walked out,
it was just me and Lucas.

34:26.500 --> 34:29.625
And he couldn't talk yet,
but his eyes said it all.

34:29.667 --> 34:32.000
"Where's Mommy?
You're not my mommy."

34:32.041 --> 34:33.917
When Violet came back,
I was so angry at her,

34:33.959 --> 34:35.208
but she did come back.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.875
And I gave her
another chance.

34:36.917 --> 34:40.041
And whatever I think about her,
she's an incredible mother.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.250
Lucas would be
much worse off without her.

34:42.291 --> 34:43.959
WOMAN:
Dr. Freedman.

34:45.542 --> 34:46.834
I had to call.

34:46.875 --> 34:49.041
I've spoken
with Melissa and Denise.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.417
I'm aware of the situation.
There is no situation.

34:51.458 --> 34:53.208
Unless Melissa
starts using again.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.041
WOMAN:
There's no way to know.

34:55.083 --> 34:58.041
But Melissa did make a choice
to get clean for her child.

34:58.083 --> 35:01.166
Dr. Freedman, we've been
through this a lot of times.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.750
We like to keep a child
with its mother if possible.

35:03.792 --> 35:06.959
But if your instincts say
it's to Eli's detriment,

35:07.041 --> 35:08.458
then we can explore
other options.

35:10.792 --> 35:15.500
Mm-hm. Yeah.

35:15.542 --> 35:17.041
( whispers ):
I need to talk to you.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.500
( whispers ):
Just a minute.

35:18.542 --> 35:20.542
No, I need to talk to you now.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.375
( in normal voice ):
Shainie, Can I call back?

35:23.667 --> 35:26.041
Yeah. Thanks.
What's so important?

35:26.083 --> 35:27.291
( in normal voice ):
I have a lead

35:27.333 --> 35:29.041
on a way to treat
Erica's gliosarcoma.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.208
I have a lead.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.917
If it involves
getting on a plane,

35:31.959 --> 35:33.875
Erica already said
she didn't wanna do that.

35:33.917 --> 35:36.333
This one involves
getting on a plane to Seattle.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.750
I think my brother Derek
can help us.

35:41.583 --> 35:43.000
( sighs )

35:45.625 --> 35:50.083
People can do awful things,
but they can also change.

35:50.125 --> 35:53.291
You don't know my mother.
No, I don't.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.125
But I do know
that being a parent is hard.

35:55.166 --> 35:57.375
And it is easy to make mistakes.

35:57.417 --> 36:01.250
Even when you're trying
to do the right thing.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.125
Is that why
you're giving her Eli?

36:03.166 --> 36:05.375
Because you think
it's been hard for her?

36:05.417 --> 36:07.000
I think it's been hard
for your mom.

36:07.041 --> 36:08.583
I think
it's been hard for you.

36:08.625 --> 36:12.166
And it's sad.

36:13.667 --> 36:17.959
But hopefully it can be
a reminder to both of you,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.041
that with Eli,
it has to be different.

36:21.083 --> 36:23.750
He's gonna need a lot of care
while he's recovering.

36:23.792 --> 36:29.000
Your mom's gonna need help
being a mom.

36:30.583 --> 36:32.417
I--

36:32.458 --> 36:34.250
I know it must not
seem fair to you,

36:35.333 --> 36:37.125
but you are a family.

36:37.166 --> 36:40.583
And you have to look out
for one another.

36:48.917 --> 36:50.375
Hey.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.542
Lucas wanted to know
if his truck could fly,

36:52.583 --> 36:55.041
and it can't,
so I got him a new one.

36:55.083 --> 36:58.000
I thought he could leave it
at your house. No stairs.

37:04.417 --> 37:06.041
You know,
it's just sex.

37:06.083 --> 37:09.375
With Scott. It's just sex.
It's a distraction.

37:09.417 --> 37:10.667
( chuckles )

37:10.709 --> 37:13.625
I'm sorry.
I'm just not evolved enough

37:13.667 --> 37:15.041
to wanna hear
about your sex life.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.417
No. I wasn't gonna
give you details,

37:16.458 --> 37:18.291
I just wanted you to know
it wasn't serious.

37:18.333 --> 37:21.041
Okay. I just...
I still don't like it.

37:21.083 --> 37:23.041
You walked away,
so you shouldn't care.

37:23.083 --> 37:25.625
I know I shouldn't care,
but I do.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.667
You do?

37:30.083 --> 37:31.291
Yeah.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.041
Well, maybe that means--

37:34.083 --> 37:37.291
You don't have to interpret
my feelings, Violet. I just...

37:37.333 --> 37:39.583
( tender rock music
playing )

37:39.625 --> 37:41.834
I care.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.041
Is he really
gonna be okay?

37:50.083 --> 37:52.041
I resected the damaged part
of Eli's lung.

37:52.083 --> 37:54.542
In time, healthy tissue
will grow in its place.

37:55.792 --> 37:57.625
Thank you.

37:57.667 --> 37:59.417
You can do this,
Melissa.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.542
I know.
It's all about Eli now.

38:05.166 --> 38:07.083
Maybe not all.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.166
I thought that you--
Bailed?

38:17.750 --> 38:19.083
Yeah.

38:21.291 --> 38:23.750
I'm...

38:23.792 --> 38:26.917
I'm so--
I know, Mom. I know.

38:29.709 --> 38:31.208
I am sorry.

38:33.125 --> 38:37.542
Then do better
with Eli, okay?

38:39.083 --> 38:40.333
Do better.

38:50.959 --> 38:53.959
Hey. How's it going
with your sister?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.166
SAM:
Pretty much the same.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.041
It'll take a while
for the meds to wear off.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.750
You took her off everything?
SHELDON: No.

38:59.792 --> 39:01.625
No, I kept her
on a mild sedative,

39:01.667 --> 39:05.959
because we didn't know
what to expect when...

39:06.000 --> 39:07.542
We just don't know
anything yet.

39:10.834 --> 39:14.041
Keep me updated, okay?
Thanks, Sheldon.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.750
You keep her at your house?

39:15.792 --> 39:18.333
No, no.
She's in my office.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.542
Staring at the walls.
That's hard.

39:23.792 --> 39:26.000
Yeah, it's...
Hard.

39:32.083 --> 39:33.417
Hey.
Hey.

39:43.917 --> 39:45.250
Okay.

39:45.291 --> 39:48.333
Should've seen that coming.
Didn't. Should've.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.625
Jake.
When you're, uh...

39:50.667 --> 39:53.834
When you're ready to meet
more surrogates, let me know.

39:57.792 --> 40:00.583
CHARLOTTE:
I know it's complicated
and it's scary,

40:00.625 --> 40:02.792
and we can't promise you
that this will work.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.625
The one thing I can promise
is this gives you a little hope.

40:05.667 --> 40:07.041
Isn't that what we said
about chemo?

40:07.083 --> 40:10.041
What we said about chemo
was it would buy you some time.

40:10.083 --> 40:13.291
You told us you didn't want
whatever time you had left

40:13.333 --> 40:15.834
ruined by what chemo does
to your body.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.291
But this surgery,

40:17.333 --> 40:19.709
it has the potential to be
more than just a treatment.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.458
We're not talking
about buying time,

40:21.500 --> 40:23.875
we're talking
about curing you.

40:23.917 --> 40:26.417
I know you don't wanna
tell Mason

40:26.458 --> 40:28.208
that at some point
this tumor will kill you.

40:28.250 --> 40:33.000
If you're open to this,
you may not have to.

40:35.542 --> 40:39.792
( tender theme playing )

40:51.667 --> 40:53.250
Hey.

40:55.917 --> 40:57.083
You hungry?

41:03.291 --> 41:04.875
It reminds me.

41:04.917 --> 41:10.500
Remember that house
we used to go to in the summers?

41:10.542 --> 41:13.250
It was in North Carolina.

41:13.291 --> 41:15.375
Right on the beach.

41:21.417 --> 41:23.750
Uh, yeah,
I remember.

41:28.583 --> 41:31.000
Your house reminds me of that.

42:02.709 --> 42:06.083
I pushed myself
to the limit that semester.

42:06.125 --> 42:09.041
Maybe even past the limit.

42:09.083 --> 42:13.083
I was stressed,
didn't sleep,

42:13.125 --> 42:16.041
got an incomplete in tennis,
had to take it over.

42:16.083 --> 42:18.208
THERAPIST:
And in retrospect?

42:20.208 --> 42:22.458
I loved every minute of it.

42:30.083 --> 42:32.625
( soft theme playing )
