00:09.943 --> 00:11.979
<i>Every lawyer has one case</i>

00:12.080 --> 00:14.215
<i>that keeps them up at night,
and this is mine.</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:16.317
Can you tell
our podcast listeners about it?

00:16.417 --> 00:18.986
My client, Antonia Suarez,

00:19.087 --> 00:21.021
was wrongfully accused,

00:21.122 --> 00:23.757
and despite my best efforts, convicted

00:23.857 --> 00:25.393
of first degree murder.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.295
She's currently serving
a life sentence

00:27.395 --> 00:29.263
for a crime she did not commit.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.300
And where are you
in the case right now?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.235
We've used up
all of our appeals.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.003
And now, 13 years later,

00:36.104 --> 00:38.239
I'm looking
for a new piece of evidence

00:38.339 --> 00:39.740
that can exonerate Antonia.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.842
You're still searching. Why?

00:41.942 --> 00:44.512
Because I believe
Antonia Suarez is innocent,

00:44.612 --> 00:48.382
and Raya Chen's killer
is still out there.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.318
Walk us through the case.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.086
In November of 2009,

00:52.186 --> 00:54.322
Antonia came home from work
and noticed

00:54.422 --> 00:55.956
her neighbor Raya's door
was ajar.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.227
She went in and found Raya Chen
laying on the ground,

00:59.327 --> 01:01.129
unconscious and bleeding.

01:01.229 --> 01:05.599
Antonia tried to help her,
and held her until Raya died.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.136
Ooh. Trick or treat.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.140
Ooh. Somebody's popular, huh?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.409
Ooh.

01:15.509 --> 01:19.280
Ew! No! Agnes!

01:19.380 --> 01:20.381
Dental floss?

01:20.481 --> 01:23.016
Hey, where's my mom?

01:24.152 --> 01:25.219
Police found Antonia

01:25.319 --> 01:27.155
covered in Raya's blood.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.956
They read her
her Miranda rights

01:29.056 --> 01:32.360
and interrogated her
in English, but...

01:32.460 --> 01:34.228
That sounds like my son...

01:34.328 --> 01:36.029
Whoa!

01:36.164 --> 01:37.498
...Todd.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.433
Sorry. Sorry, wasn't sure
what was happening in here.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.169
What is happening...

01:42.170 --> 01:42.903
Hi.

01:43.003 --> 01:45.173
Okay, right. You're Todd.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.775
Exactly as Allison
described you.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.477
Oh, Allison?
Why? What did she say?

01:49.577 --> 01:51.245
Idiot? Fool? Handsome?

01:51.345 --> 01:53.314
Witty? Charming.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.484
None of those exact words, no.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.685
Oh.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.453
Todd, this is Lea Luna.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.255
She and Allison
did undergrad together.

02:01.355 --> 02:05.092
Lea is the podcast host
for <i>PDX-Files.</i>

02:05.193 --> 02:06.527
Oh, great.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.762
So what are we podcasting
about, huh?

02:08.862 --> 02:10.398
True crime? False crime?
Crime crime?

02:10.498 --> 02:11.899
My mom doesn't know podcasts.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.867
Yes, I do. Now I do.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.303
Since Lea reached out to me

02:15.403 --> 02:16.537
about the Antonia Suarez case,

02:16.637 --> 02:18.806
I've been listening
to her podcast,

02:18.906 --> 02:22.109
and, uh, I find it captivating. Aw.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.612
So, can we just continue
podding and ignore him?

02:24.712 --> 02:27.315
Where were we?
Okay.

02:27.415 --> 02:31.352
The police interrogated
Antonia in English.

02:31.452 --> 02:35.223
When Antonia was arrested,
she predominantly spoke Spanish,

02:35.223 --> 02:37.258
very limited understanding
of English.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.827
And law enforcement used that
against her.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.695
They convinced her

02:41.795 --> 02:42.863
to sign a confession.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.598
And her fingerprints

02:44.698 --> 02:46.099
and DNA were everywhere.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.368
Well,
what was the murder weapon?

02:47.468 --> 02:48.569
Todd, we're recording.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.970
Okay. Fine.

02:50.070 --> 02:53.241
The weapon was never found.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.776
And now, they are about
to transfer Antonia

02:55.876 --> 02:59.046
to a prison in Oklahoma, which
will make it next to impossible

02:59.146 --> 03:00.881
for her daughter
Kacey to see her.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.351
So, what is the plan?

03:03.451 --> 03:06.254
We need new evidence
to bring a writ of habeas corpus

03:06.354 --> 03:07.588
to the judge.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.056
With new evidence, we can prove

03:09.156 --> 03:11.659
that Antonia's incarceration
was invalid.

03:11.759 --> 03:15.796
So, Margaret, what would you
like to say to our listeners?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.432
If you know anything

03:18.532 --> 03:21.902
about Raya Chen's murder at the
Northwest Trinity apartments,

03:22.002 --> 03:23.771
November 2009,

03:23.871 --> 03:25.839
please call us.

03:25.939 --> 03:29.877
This is our last chance
to free an innocent woman.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.913
Great. That was so great.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.181
I'm just gonna
clean all this up,

03:34.282 --> 03:35.349
and I will get

03:35.449 --> 03:37.017
this episode out tonight.
Thank you.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.086
Hey, Mar, we got to get over
to the prison now.

03:39.186 --> 03:42.623
Of course. Thank you, Lea.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.492
Um, so, can I just go?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.159
Do I need to log out
or un-pod or anything?

03:46.294 --> 03:48.996
Um, no. (laughs) No,
I got it. Um, go ahead.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.098
Thank you.
Thank you.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.500
Hmm.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.802
Mm-hmm.
Mm-mm.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.604
Mm-hmm.
Hmm-mm.

03:57.405 --> 04:00.541
So what do <i>you</i> think?
Is Antonia innocent?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.976
Oh, absolutely.
I think it's pretty obvious

04:03.076 --> 04:05.313
to anyone who's been
paying attention that Antoni-o

04:05.313 --> 04:08.015
is 100%,
without question, innocent.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.319
Okay. I...

04:11.319 --> 04:14.187
I am speaking to
investigator Todd Wright.
Mm-hmm.

04:14.322 --> 04:19.126
Uh, if <i>Antoni-a</i> didn't
kill Raya Chen, then who did?

04:19.226 --> 04:21.128
Well, I think that's
the million dollar question,

04:21.228 --> 04:22.896
isn't it?
Mm.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.367
But I think if you look really
closely at all the suspects...

04:26.467 --> 04:29.670
Just curious. Can you name
<i>any</i> of the suspects?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.705
Oh, I can name 20. Okay.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.507
There's Jason...
Uh-huh.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.343
Mason... Grayson.

04:35.343 --> 04:39.347
This was a huge case for your
mother very early in her career.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.582
I mean, she poured
her whole life into this case.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.851
Surely, you've got
to know... something.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.218
Of course, certainly.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.355
All the names
and particulars are very,

04:47.355 --> 04:49.189
very intimately familiar to me.

04:49.357 --> 04:53.260
But, um, at the time, in 2009,

04:53.361 --> 04:56.730
my mother was very,
very focused on her career,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.799
and we were... not so close.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.668
Because she was

05:00.768 --> 05:04.204
doggedly pursuing justice
for Antonia Suarez

05:04.372 --> 05:05.939
because she was a...
a working mother.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.908
Mm, more like
a working-all-the-time mother,

05:08.008 --> 05:11.011
and, uh, while she was doggedly
missing my 18th birthday,

05:11.111 --> 05:12.846
I was having cereal for dinner

05:12.946 --> 05:15.749
and packing
for college on my own.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.152
This case haunts your mother.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.855
Yeah, well,

05:21.955 --> 05:24.425
we're all a bit haunted.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.894
Todd, are you okay? Is Mom okay?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.429
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all fine.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.664
So you went to college
with this Lea Luna, huh?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.434
You did not have me paged
for dating advice.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.268
I don't need dating advice.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.904
I need to know
what you told her about me.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.508
Todd, I was with a patient
who was bleeding from his ear.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.309
And she's way too good for you.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.178
Oh. Okay. Great.
Now I'm bleeding from my ears.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.715
Great vote of confidence...
from my own sister.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.584
If she agrees to go out
with you-- no chance--

05:50.684 --> 05:53.086
just don't use
that weird fake French accent

05:53.186 --> 05:54.455
that you do
when you order wine, okay?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.590
Just order beer.
She's super down-to-earth.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.627
And-- I don't know--
just don't be... you.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.094
Be more competent.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.430
Huh.
And definitely

06:02.430 --> 06:03.797
don't go on and on and on

06:03.897 --> 06:05.766
about that weather balloon
conspiracy theory.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.169
Even if the balloons are mobile
listening stations for the NSA?

06:09.269 --> 06:10.838
No.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.240
<i>Antonia, I know</i>

06:13.340 --> 06:15.075
a podcast may seem unusual,

06:15.175 --> 06:16.343
and it may feel invasive,

06:16.444 --> 06:17.678
but they have led

06:17.778 --> 06:19.112
to exonerations.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.023
I'm still getting
trolled online.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.160
Daughter of the crazy lady
who killed her neighbor?

06:33.260 --> 06:35.996
Kacey, I know that's hard.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.498
But what if
this podcast

06:37.598 --> 06:40.167
could pull the real murderer
out of the shadows?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.969
What if it works, <i>cari√±o?</i>

06:42.069 --> 06:44.037
What if I could
walk out of here?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.339
In time for your birthday?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.176
Kacey, please.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.712
It's our last chance.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.549
What have we got to lose?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.921
Okay, fine. Do it.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.857
Just don't pin
all your hopes on this, Mom.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.695
I don't want to see
you get hurt all over again.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.935
<i>I don't know what</i>

07:15.035 --> 07:16.336
you're talking about.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.605
I should be working this case
and not him!

07:17.705 --> 07:19.172
Is there a problem
with my work?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.775
Of course not. Todd doesn't know
a thing about this case.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.210
My point exactly!

07:23.310 --> 07:25.278
Mom, Lyle knows the knowns
and the known-knowns.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.380
But I am the unknown.
I'm the one

07:27.515 --> 07:29.116
who doesn't know anything.
About anything.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.518
I'm fresh eyes.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.720
I'm full of new questions
and new theories.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.421
You and this
textbook-come-to-life

07:34.522 --> 07:35.956
have been working this case
for 13 years?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.357
And where have you gotten?

07:37.525 --> 07:39.026
You need fresh eyes.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.094
Not... stale eyes.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.964
Todd, that is extremely
ill-mannered and oddly logical.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.601
I concur, and I am up to my own
fresh eyes in current cases,

07:47.701 --> 07:50.103
so please take
this file box...

07:50.203 --> 07:52.139
and go to your nook.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.007
Okay.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.643
Sorry.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.179
You are not just doing
this to impress...?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.681
Lea.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.383
Hey. I'll be the investigator
on this case now.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.385
Lyle had
to alphabetize his coin purse.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.654
So, let's pod.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.921
What's our next move?
Ignore him.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.623
We need to strategize.
Make a plan.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.024
Well, for the next episode,

08:11.124 --> 08:13.426
I wanted to focus
on the compelling characters

08:13.561 --> 08:15.362
of the case.
Here's a fresh idea.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.930
Let's introduce Lea

08:17.030 --> 08:19.567
to all the original suspects,
aka characters.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.968
Give her a lay
of the land,

08:21.068 --> 08:23.136
maybe a meet-and-greet,
or at least a sip-n-see.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.573
A sip-n-see?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.079
According to security cameras,

08:32.179 --> 08:34.582
no one came into
or out of the building

08:34.582 --> 08:35.983
around the time
of Raya's murder.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.219
So I think that we--
you-- should interview

08:39.319 --> 08:42.990
everyone who was there
that night, starting...

08:44.291 --> 08:45.793
...with her--

08:45.893 --> 08:48.428
Evelyn Wilder, novelist.

08:48.596 --> 08:49.897
Writes British romance-y

08:49.997 --> 08:52.199
kind of things with wrinkled
ascots and stolen ladles.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.736
Speak three languages.
But she didn't do it?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.671
She said she was writing
in her apartment,

08:57.771 --> 09:00.874
"in the flow," wearing
her noise-canceling headphones.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.276
That's not an alibi. No.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.246
But there's no evidence that
puts her in Raya's apartment

09:06.346 --> 09:07.380
around the time
of the murder.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.818
That's an odd laugh.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.220
And what about him?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.323
Devin DeLeon, accountant.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.325
Long-time resident.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.760
And he has an alibi?
No.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.061
But Devin's a big cricket fan.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.330
He claims that
after his team lost that day,

09:23.430 --> 09:24.765
he drowned himself

09:24.865 --> 09:27.167
in vodka gimlets
and fell asleep.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.807
And last, but not least...

09:33.907 --> 09:37.277
Olga Szabo, building super.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.746
In my mind,
it was always her.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.180
Why?
She refused

09:40.280 --> 09:42.650
to speak to the police,
and she lawyered up

09:42.750 --> 09:44.652
before my team had a chance
to interview her.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.153
Whoa.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.722
I remember you. You're
that murderer's lawyer.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.858
Uh, I'm recording this. Wonderful.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.293
I'm listening
to your sick podcast.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.295
Raya was a beautiful woman,

09:55.395 --> 09:56.964
and you're making her
death into a spectacle.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.566
You moved into her apartment
after she died.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.969
Raya's apartment
is a sacred space.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.772
And for someone with such
exquisite bone structure

10:04.872 --> 10:06.006
and delicate fingers
to be taken

10:06.106 --> 10:08.441
before their time
is a travesty.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.210
Don't make
a second episode.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.146
And I don't want to ever
see you outside here again.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.547
Good day.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.219
Okay, we definitely got
to break in

10:19.319 --> 10:20.888
and check
that guy's apartment out, right?

10:20.988 --> 10:23.090
Totally sus!
Should we go up
right now?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.158
Absolutely not.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.293
Not while I'm here.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.527
And if you do-- but don't--

10:27.627 --> 10:29.062
I can't know
anything about it.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.231
I am going.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.002
Plausible deniability.
Do it tomorrow.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.636
I don't know!

10:36.737 --> 10:38.571
I do not know.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.941
So I guess
we'll come back tomorrow?

10:41.709 --> 10:44.077
<i>Kristy could hear</i>

10:44.177 --> 10:47.214
the killer crawling
under her bed.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.149
Oh, my Lord.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.519
And the sailor's
disemboweled torso was stuffed

10:52.619 --> 10:54.521
into an empty torpedo.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.523
Good God!

10:56.623 --> 10:58.992
Where is Lea's podcast?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.895
Ah.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.897
Raya Chen was bludgeoned
to death

11:03.997 --> 11:05.999
at the back of her head.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.500
Autopsy reports say

11:07.600 --> 11:11.271
her skull bone ruptured
her cerebral cortex.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.245
Hello.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.981
Hello?

11:21.081 --> 11:23.250
MECHANICALLY-ALTERED VOICE:
Antonia killed Raya Chen.

11:23.350 --> 11:27.320
Stop the investigation,
or you're dead, too.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.370
<i>What do you mean, this can't be</i>

11:43.470 --> 11:44.772
her first death threat?

11:44.772 --> 11:46.239
She's my mom.
Moms don't get threatened.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.407
Well, moms might not,

11:47.507 --> 11:49.509
but lawyers and judges do
all the time.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.778
She never told <i>me</i> that.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.380
Well, she's protecting you.
From what?

11:53.480 --> 11:54.782
From worrying about her,

11:54.782 --> 11:56.116
or feeling like
you have to protect her.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.650
But from a case perspective,

11:57.785 --> 11:59.086
this means we are
on the right track.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.420
Huh.
Means someone's rattled.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.089
If Antonia did it,
then no one would bother

12:02.189 --> 12:03.423
to threaten your mom.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.692
Okay, 3B. This is Devin's.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.460
I'll knock. If he's home,

12:07.560 --> 12:09.096
I'm Brett
from the Portland Water Bureau.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.064
He saw you earlier,
but undercover.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.665
I like it.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.102
Okay, I am recording.
Go ahead.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.204
Portland Water Bureau!

12:17.304 --> 12:19.873
Here to check your water!

12:19.973 --> 12:21.208
I don't think he's home.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.843
All right, I'm gonna
check outside,

12:22.943 --> 12:24.177
see if I can
scale the building or something.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.313
Or we could jimmy the lock.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.015
Do you want

12:28.115 --> 12:29.582
to hold my stuff
while I break in?

12:29.682 --> 12:32.119
I've been waiting my whole life
for someone to ask me that.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.187
That and
"Sir, can you fly this plane?"

12:34.287 --> 12:36.957
But this is breaking
and entering, you know that.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.492
Yeah. Only if we get caught.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.499
Hello?

12:49.169 --> 12:50.570
Wow.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.141
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
that's Raya Chen. Oh, wow.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.143
You know,
if I'm remembering correctly,

12:56.243 --> 13:00.147
She would have died
right... here,

13:00.247 --> 13:02.515
right where we are standing.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.619
Well, maybe this is the
sacred part of his apartment.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.021
But now,
we need to find out

13:08.121 --> 13:09.356
where he keeps his mementos,

13:09.456 --> 13:11.658
like teeth and bones,
or her delicate fingers.

13:11.758 --> 13:12.860
Here. I'll take the bedroom.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.261
I'll take kitchen. Okay.
Mm-hmm.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.563
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hey, he does ride a bike.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.298
So if he happens
to be the last man

13:18.398 --> 13:19.933
in America with a landline,
try calling my phone.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.069
Maybe it'll match the number
that called my mom's last night.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.104
Oh, come on. You know
that call definitely came

13:24.204 --> 13:25.538
from some rando burner phone.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.541
Yeah, you're probably right.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.089
Okay.
So,

13:42.189 --> 13:44.124
no landline,
but I did find a package

13:44.224 --> 13:45.658
for a disposable burner phone.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.794
So... What are you doing?
I think there's

13:47.895 --> 13:49.529
an envelope... in the wall.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.763
It's... Ah!

13:50.898 --> 13:53.366
Spiders.
It's the spiders.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.368
There's a-- it's like
<i>Temple of Doom</i> back there.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.104
But there's something
hidden in that side wall.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.006
Wait. Really?
Let me take a look. Yeah.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.041
Killers will sometimes
keep hair, or

14:01.141 --> 14:03.110
shoes or...

14:03.210 --> 14:04.611
What's that?

14:04.711 --> 14:07.347
Papers... written
in Chinese.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.716
What?
I mean, might be Devin's,

14:09.816 --> 14:11.318
but might be Raya's?

14:11.418 --> 14:13.453
Well, I'd say, from the
17 layers of deathly cobwebs,

14:13.553 --> 14:15.022
nobody's been back there
for a really long time.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.824
I mean, maybe these are
messages, like, from her.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.292
Well, to who?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.161
I don't know. To her family?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.163
Maybe she wrote down
her messages,

14:23.263 --> 14:25.165
hid it under her sink
behind some sticky paper

14:25.265 --> 14:26.799
because she's paranoid?

14:26.934 --> 14:28.568
Because she thought
she was being watched?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.770
Yes! Like by weather balloons.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.339
Wait. Are-are you serious?

14:32.439 --> 14:33.941
Did Allison tell you
to say that?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.476
No. Like, the Pentagon
basically flat-out admitted

14:36.576 --> 14:38.278
that low-range weather balloons
are highly effective...

14:38.378 --> 14:40.347
For short range surveillance!
I read that, too!

14:40.447 --> 14:41.949
Oh, my gosh,
how'd you know that?

14:41.949 --> 14:43.850
Wait.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.054
Oh, crap. That's him.
What's happened?

14:47.154 --> 14:48.288
Devin. He's, um...
he's-he's back!

14:48.388 --> 14:49.522
What?
Uh, he's back.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.391
Okay, here.
Uh, I got your purse.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.426
Come on. Go, go, go, go.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.572
Hey. What's going on back here?

15:05.672 --> 15:08.075
Oh. Hey. Lea's just
backing up her recordings.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.977
Did you know
she could pick a lock?

15:10.978 --> 15:12.379
Have you asked her out?

15:12.479 --> 15:15.048
Uh, no, but tonight,
we're both strategically free,

15:15.148 --> 15:17.985
so I think it's understood
that a date's happening.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.886
Hmm. Don't take her bowling.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.554
What? Why?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.556
Todd, you took me bowling
on our first date.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.359
And don't order any beer.
It makes you very...

15:26.459 --> 15:28.061
Well, not always.
It's the wheat, or the lager,

15:28.161 --> 15:29.396
but that makes everybody...

15:29.496 --> 15:30.763
And you're a very bad bowler.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.366
Charmingly bad.
I'm actually very good.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.435
No, you're not.
Todd, you bowled into a lady,

15:35.535 --> 15:37.770
knocked her down.
We had to drive her to the ER.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.273
Okay, well, those lanes
were very slippery.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.743
Impress her.
Take her someplace well-reviewed

15:43.843 --> 15:45.612
with dim lights
and white tablecloths.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.280
And don't wear
what you're wearing.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.781
And don't drive your car.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.217
Oh, and don't talk about
that weird weather balloon stuff

15:50.317 --> 15:51.551
that you've been constant...

15:51.651 --> 15:53.020
Uh, too late.
She knows they're real.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.254
The Pentagon practically...

15:54.354 --> 15:56.923
And... don't be nervous.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.559
You'll be great.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.795
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.639
Todd is worried about me?

16:12.739 --> 16:15.242
Yeah, about the threats,
the call.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.144
Has anything else happened?

16:17.244 --> 16:19.379
No, no, no, no. And there's
nothing to worry about.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.048
It is part of the job.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.515
Trust me, I can handle it.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.784
I have been doing this
a long time.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.787
Yeah, he mentioned that
you missed some of his birthdays

16:27.887 --> 16:29.822
because of-of work, this case.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.859
I would never miss a birthday.
He wouldn't say that.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.230
Mm, more like
a working-all-the-time mother.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.133
And, uh, while she was doggedly
missing my 18th birthday,

16:40.233 --> 16:41.934
I was having cereal for dinner

16:42.069 --> 16:44.737
and packing for college
on my own.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.673
I just called Jack.
He said he could...

16:46.773 --> 16:48.308
Oh, and, uh, Jack is
Francey's super-hot boyfriend

16:48.408 --> 16:49.709
who's also a cop.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.978
Todd...
What? He is.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.513
Jack said he can
get you a warrant

16:53.613 --> 16:54.747
to get you
into Devin's apartment

16:54.847 --> 16:56.216
if you have probable cause.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.751
But you haven't already
been inside, have you?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.154
We were never there.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.760
Excuse me, Officer.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.330
We're here
to see Devin DeLeon.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.764
We have a warrant.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.600
That's going to be a bit
of a problem, ma'am.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.902
Mr. DeLeon is dead.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.546
Initially, we suspected suicide,
but there's no note,

17:26.646 --> 17:29.949
and the trajectory of this fall
makes us think he was pushed.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.451
So now you suspect murder?

17:31.551 --> 17:32.785
It's early,

17:32.885 --> 17:34.554
but my partner's
taking statements

17:34.654 --> 17:36.923
from some
of the neighbors.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.692
Uh, afternoon,
Officer Kendrick.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.129
I'm Clay
with Peaceful Transitions.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.430
I'm here, state mandate,

17:43.530 --> 17:46.633
to hold a space
for the recently departed.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.435
Do you mind if I sit?
Do what you got to do.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.503
Thank you. Appreciate it.

17:54.141 --> 17:58.345
Dearly Beloved,
we are gathered here today

17:58.445 --> 18:00.613
to support
our earthly friend Devin

18:00.713 --> 18:03.916
as he passes
from this plane to the next.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.453
Now, to some,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.621
Devin was just a random person

18:08.721 --> 18:11.391
who rode a bicycle...

18:11.491 --> 18:13.760
with a weird temperament.

18:13.860 --> 18:17.697
But to God...

18:17.797 --> 18:19.566
he's Devin.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.401
And to me...

18:22.735 --> 18:24.437
...he's also Devin.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.440
YOU-BET-LINE.
Want to place a bet

18:27.540 --> 18:30.177
on the horses or the game today?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.744
That apartment is jinxed.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.548
13 years ago, a woman was
murdered in that same unit.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.217
Raya Chen. Yeah.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.785
Did you work that case?

18:38.885 --> 18:40.887
Nah, I was just a rookie
handling crowd control.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.390
But it stuck in your memory?

18:43.490 --> 18:46.326
All I recall is the two
senior detectives arguing

18:46.426 --> 18:47.660
about who was running point.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.896
Do you happen
to remember their names?

18:49.996 --> 18:53.600
Like I said,
it-it was so long ago.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.035
Ma'am.

18:56.203 --> 19:00.072
So, looks like Mr. Chalk Outline
was a gambler.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.808
Ah.
Just checked his burner phone,

19:01.908 --> 19:03.410
and he only used it
to call his bookie.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.212
Your number wasn't in there, not
even in the recently deleted,

19:05.212 --> 19:07.013
so, he is not
your creepy caller.

19:07.113 --> 19:10.417
This Officer Lupo
has me thinking

19:10.517 --> 19:13.220
about the detectives who ran
the original crime scene.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.588
I'm going to go back
and talk to Francey.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.291
Why don't you go and talk
to the building manager-- Olga.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.827
Olga.
See if she can tell you anything
about the other tenants

19:20.927 --> 19:23.230
who were here at the
time of Raya's death. Okay.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.831
I'll catch up with Lea.
Hey, Todd, Todd?

19:24.931 --> 19:27.567
Mm-hmm?
Why did you tell Lea

19:27.667 --> 19:29.702
that I forgot
your 18th birthday?

19:29.802 --> 19:32.705
I didn't.
I got you that camera.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.074
Uh, that was my 17th.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.076
Well, then the Playtime station.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.411
PlayStation?

19:38.511 --> 19:39.846
Uh-huh.
Sixteenth.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.914
You missed my 18th
birthday, Mom. You did.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.816
Whatever.
It's fine.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.052
But when I became
a legal adult,

19:46.152 --> 19:49.856
you were... not there.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.361
<i>This is terrible.</i>

19:54.461 --> 19:56.763
We live in
a cursed building. Mm.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.365
I want to crawl
under my covers

19:58.465 --> 20:01.200
with a tub of vegan ice cream
and stay there forever.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.903
Now I'll never be able
to rent that apartment again.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.838
Olga, who do you think did this?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.474
I have no idea.

20:07.574 --> 20:11.210
I think now, whoever killed Raya
is still out there.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.314
It can't be Antonia,
that poor girl in jail.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.648
She's too sweet.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.350
Oh, such a good heart.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.185
Would it be possible for us to
get records of who else lived

20:19.286 --> 20:20.753
in the building
when Raya was killed?

20:20.853 --> 20:23.590
Not a chance. No.
Ms. Szabo,

20:23.690 --> 20:24.957
I need a statement from you.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.360
I don't talk to police.
Call my lawyer.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.728
And you--

20:28.828 --> 20:30.162
you want to see
my records?
Uh-huh.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.665
Get a warrant.
Not even for <i>PDX-Files?</i>

20:32.765 --> 20:34.166
The number one
true-crime podcast

20:34.267 --> 20:35.635
in the Pacific Northwest?
You're from <i>PDX-Files?</i>

20:35.735 --> 20:37.003
Yes. Well, no, not me.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.505
But this is Lea Luna.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.839
Wow.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.074
My wife is obsessed
with your podcast.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.242
Oh.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.412
Uh, you're gonna
turn down <i>PDX-Files?</i>

20:47.213 --> 20:49.382
Fine. Follow me to the basement.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.917
I'll show you the files.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.152
But I'm not going
to talk about it.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.754
Okay?

20:54.854 --> 20:56.423
Detective Ekert?

20:56.523 --> 20:58.358
Black, two sugars?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.192
Oh, Attorney Wright.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.495
You must need something.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.730
Hello, Francey.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.831
We're here
about the Raya Chen case,

21:04.931 --> 21:06.065
2009.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.200
That was Police Chief Linton.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.102
He got the boot in 2010,
died last year.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.238
What does Linton have
to do with the Chen case?

21:12.339 --> 21:15.342
Well, a lot of bad stuff went
down on Lousy Linton's watch.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.243
He cut corners
on pretty much everything.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.379
The police report said that you

21:19.479 --> 21:22.349
and Detective Walsh were first
to process the scene.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.655
No, it was just Walsh.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.056
I was there for a second,

21:30.156 --> 21:31.891
and then got called
to a robbery around the block.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.361
There's supposed to be two names
on every report,

21:34.361 --> 21:36.996
but Linton told us to fudge it.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.998
A woman is serving
a life sentence,

21:39.098 --> 21:41.067
and now you're telling me
about cut corners?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.669
Thanks for the coffee.
No, wait.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.004
I need to find Walsh.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.740
He's on death's door himself,
in some hospice.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.576
Let him be.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.845
We are calling
every hospice in the area

21:52.945 --> 21:54.714
until we find him. Yep.

21:54.814 --> 21:58.418
The next file
belongs to...

21:58.518 --> 22:01.388
Ah. Uh, Francois Gagnon.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.789
Hmm.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.692
It looks like he lived here

22:05.792 --> 22:08.060
in 2012, and then he worked

22:08.160 --> 22:10.029
for zee telephone company.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.398
So, um,

22:11.398 --> 22:12.965
after Allison jetted off
to college,

22:13.065 --> 22:14.401
it was just you
and your nom at home?

22:14.501 --> 22:17.103
Yeah, yeah, Allison and Lawrence
were both at U of O,

22:17.203 --> 22:20.172
and I was a freshman
in high school when my dad died.

22:20.272 --> 22:23.610
And that's when your mom
started working all the time?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.579
Working and law school,
passed the bar, made partner,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.549
and then became
<i>the</i> Margaret Wright.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.151
Hey, hey, this is Raya's file!

22:32.251 --> 22:33.720
Wait. Really?
Uh-huh.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.087
Oh, wow.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.690
Looks like she was constantly

22:37.790 --> 22:40.192
filing complaints
with the city's inspector.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.228
Wait. Look at all of these.

22:42.328 --> 22:47.233
Mm, leaky furnaces and flies,
faulty smoke detectors?

22:47.333 --> 22:49.135
Wait. Maybe Olga was worried

22:49.235 --> 22:50.670
that she'd get
the building condemned.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.239
So Olga killed Raya
over leaky furnace complaints?

22:53.339 --> 22:55.842
No way. Olga is
so not the murderer.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.877
I don't know.
It could be her.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.345
I could build an episode
around that.

22:59.446 --> 23:02.449
"Olga: Landlord or Deathlord?"

23:02.449 --> 23:04.451
You can't just
go announcing

23:04.451 --> 23:06.285
to the world
that somebody killed somebody.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.654
Oh, 'cause you've never jumped

23:07.754 --> 23:10.457
to a single conclusion
in your whole life?

23:10.557 --> 23:12.024
Well, I don't have a podcast.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.493
If I wrongfully accuse somebody,

23:13.593 --> 23:16.262
it's just me in my shower
being like, "He did it."

23:16.362 --> 23:18.330
Okay. Well, my job is
to craft a narrative

23:18.465 --> 23:20.032
using one suspect
and then another

23:20.132 --> 23:21.534
until we uncover the truth.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.837
Wait. Even if that narrative
is wrong or made up

23:24.937 --> 23:26.372
or filled with lies?

23:26.473 --> 23:27.907
Oh, you're opposed to lies?

23:28.007 --> 23:29.742
Brett from Portland
Water Bureau?

23:29.842 --> 23:32.912
Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
I will have you know

23:33.012 --> 23:35.281
that Brett is not a liar. Oh.

23:35.381 --> 23:36.816
He's a churchgoer.
Mm-hmm.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.251
And he spends his weekends
mowing lawns for old ladies.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.988
Oh, sounds
kind of sad and lonely.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.490
He's doesn't get lonely.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.492
He has his lawnmower
and the old ladies. Oh.

23:45.492 --> 23:49.496
Maybe some commitment issues,
maybe some mommy issues?

23:50.229 --> 23:52.398
Uh, yeah, maybe.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.734
But he just met this girl

23:54.834 --> 23:57.369
who makes up dark and disturbing
stories all the time.

23:57.504 --> 24:00.139
And maybe she secretly wants
to get trapped in a basement

24:00.239 --> 24:02.174
with some charming dude who
wants to take her out to dinner.

24:02.274 --> 24:06.746
Like, maybe on Saturday, 7:00,
Pacific Standard Time?

24:06.846 --> 24:08.748
Um...

24:10.650 --> 24:13.986
Oh, uh, podcast deadline.
Uh-huh.

24:14.086 --> 24:17.389
So why don't we just take
the rest of these files,

24:17.524 --> 24:19.892
and then we can sneak them
back in later?

24:19.992 --> 24:21.528
Okay.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.731
Did you close
this door up here?

24:24.831 --> 24:26.699
No.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.236
Uh, 'cause it's locked.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.437
Well, do you have
your jimmy kit thing?

24:31.538 --> 24:33.172
Yeah, but the lock is
on the outside.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.241
Here. Let me look.

24:35.341 --> 24:36.876
Okay.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.311
Something's against the door
out there.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.413
We're jammed in.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.550
You know what?
I'm gonna call my mom.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.284
Ah, no! No service!
Yeah.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.786
Okay, uh, you know what?

24:46.886 --> 24:48.387
There's got to be
another way out of here.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.222
We just got
to look around, and...

24:50.322 --> 24:51.924
And, oh,
family dinner's tonight.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.926
So my mom and sister will
freak out if I'm not there,

24:54.026 --> 24:56.963
and they will definitely
send someone to find me.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.569
Oh. Supple.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.003
Mm.
Earthy.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.437
Plummy, with...

25:05.572 --> 25:08.708
...a hint of black currant.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.442
You know,
I am positive

25:10.577 --> 25:11.578
I did not forget Todd's

25:11.678 --> 25:13.646
18th birthday.
Mom, you forgot.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.447
I remember.
People forget birthdays

25:15.582 --> 25:16.816
all the time.
It's not a big deal.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.585
Allison forgot mine
last year when...

25:18.585 --> 25:19.986
I was coming off
of a double shift.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.588
And Lawrence forgot
Clem's second birthday.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.590
Because he's working!
See, that's bad.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.092
He is the chief of staff
for the governor of Oregon!

25:26.192 --> 25:27.393
Mm-hmm.
And I was

25:27.493 --> 25:28.795
working back then, very hard,

25:28.895 --> 25:30.296
to help Todd through college.

25:30.396 --> 25:33.199
Mom, nobody is scarred for life,
especially not Todd.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.734
Where is he,
by the way?

25:34.834 --> 25:36.502
He's probably at our house
wondering where we all are.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.638
He's with Lea, the podcast host.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.840
Lea Luna? From the <i>PDX-Files?</i>

25:40.940 --> 25:44.110
Mm-hmm.
My co-workers are always
talking about that podcast.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.613
Podcasts are the death
of journalism, all right?

25:46.613 --> 25:48.648
People would rather be
entertained than informed.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.416
I just listened to... Oh.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.418
Did you know that a woman

25:52.518 --> 25:55.855
in Pensacola
ate her own daughter?

25:55.955 --> 25:58.190
Don't get any ideas.
No, these podcasts

25:58.290 --> 25:59.992
are just
horrifically fascinating.

26:00.092 --> 26:03.395
There's the man in Idaho
with a secret family

26:03.495 --> 26:04.997
in the walls
of his vacation home.

26:05.097 --> 26:05.832
And

26:05.932 --> 26:07.166
the grade school teacher

26:07.266 --> 26:08.467
from Arizona!

26:10.036 --> 26:11.003
Thank God.

26:11.103 --> 26:14.641
Who electrocuted
two husbands,

26:14.741 --> 26:16.408
and then slowly,

26:16.508 --> 26:20.747
methodically poisoned 27...

26:20.847 --> 26:22.448
Good evening, Mrs. Wright.

26:22.548 --> 26:23.983
This just came
for you.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.752
Ah, thank you, Steven.
Do you know who dropped it off?

26:25.852 --> 26:27.186
I'm not sure. Sorry.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.521
Thank you.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.325
Mom, what is that?

26:33.425 --> 26:36.262
Oh. I have no idea.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.167
Someone sent you a piece
of crime scene tape?

26:42.835 --> 26:45.071
"You're next"?

26:49.141 --> 26:50.910
Apparently so.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.783
There has to be another way
out of this place.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.317
You'd think someone
would have stored

26:58.417 --> 26:59.686
a giant box fan down here.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.320
It's hot, right?
Or is it me?

27:01.420 --> 27:03.690
No, it's hot.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.291
What's behind there?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.461
Wait a second.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.998
Okay, there's no way
we can fit in there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.900
We can't, and there's
no cell service down here,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.969
but maybe at the top
of the dumbwaiter...

27:17.069 --> 27:19.005
And in case
this text doesn't send,

27:19.105 --> 27:20.907
I will set an alarm that
will go off every two minutes

27:21.007 --> 27:23.475
till someone finds this phone.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.845
Or the battery dies, and our
corpses rot in this basement,

27:25.945 --> 27:27.413
and then we ironically become

27:27.513 --> 27:29.716
the posthumous subjects
of my podcast. Yeah.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.183
Win-win.

27:32.618 --> 27:35.287
Oh.
That worked. Okay.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.290
Now we just... wait.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.260
I have the original
detective interviews

27:41.360 --> 27:44.764
of all the tenants who were home
at the time of Raya's death.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.332
Mm-hmm.
Do you want

27:46.432 --> 27:48.534
to listen to them
while we wait to die?

27:48.634 --> 27:49.936
Sure.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.571
Thank you so much
for coming.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.741
I feel so silly.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.743
I mean, I-I've had
threats before.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.478
I just... I didn't want
to worry the kids,

27:59.578 --> 28:02.014
and I didn't want
to be alone.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.016
No, it just... it just means
we're closing in.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.351
Someone's trying
to scare you.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.153
Someone who knows
where I live.

28:07.253 --> 28:11.057
Jack said he can get the lab
to run that for prints tomorrow.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.493
Can I ask you something?
Mm-hmm.

28:14.593 --> 28:18.030
Do you remember what
we were doing 13 years ago?

28:18.130 --> 28:19.799
You were Song's assistant

28:19.899 --> 28:21.433
and studying
for your law boards.
Mm-hmm.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.904
And I was the receptionist
and going through a divorce.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.773
Why?
Oh...

28:26.773 --> 28:28.174
Because Todd
has accused me

28:28.274 --> 28:30.777
of forgetting
his 18th birthday.

28:30.777 --> 28:34.847
Uh, 18-- it's-it's such
a big birthday.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.648
It's huge.
I-I refuse to believe

28:36.783 --> 28:38.885
that I didn't do something
for him. Maybe a...

28:38.985 --> 28:40.987
What is it?

28:41.087 --> 28:43.890
Walsh. We found him.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.458
He's at a hospice
in Eastmoreland.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.396
Okay, for this last interview,
we have Detective Walsh

28:50.496 --> 28:52.198
with someone named...

28:52.298 --> 28:53.565
Germaine Gulrench.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.101
It's okay.
I can tell you're nervous.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.169
We're just gonna ask you
a few questions.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.807
Oh. You can tell
that I'm nervous?

29:02.708 --> 29:03.910
Wait a minute.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.845
I know that laugh.
That's that woman...

29:05.945 --> 29:08.014
who lives here,
the writer lady.

29:08.114 --> 29:11.117
Uh, Eve-alyn,
Evelyn W-Wilder? Wilder.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.119
No, this is
Germaine Gulrench.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.154
I mean, it's...
She just said her name.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.490
Wait a second. I remember
Germaine Gulrench from before.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.559
Here.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.832
Let's see. Yes.

29:25.832 --> 29:28.467
This explains why we couldn't
find Evelyn's file.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.735
Okay. "Germaine Gulrench."

29:29.836 --> 29:32.071
Okay. Same apartment number
as Evelyn Wilder.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.106
See? It's her.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.108
So, Germaine was a waitress,

29:36.208 --> 29:37.844
and when she finally
made it as a writer,

29:37.844 --> 29:39.745
she changed her name
to Evelyn Wilder.

29:39.846 --> 29:42.014
I don't know.
It is so hot in here.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.682
I know.
And I can't really think.

29:43.850 --> 29:48.620
And it's been three hours since
Operation Dumbwaiter, and...

29:48.720 --> 29:50.656
Um, Todd?

29:50.756 --> 29:52.124
What?

29:54.460 --> 29:57.129
Someone's trying
to cook us down here.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.730
Okay, we got to get out of here.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.000
Uh, help! Help!
Uh, help! Help!

30:01.100 --> 30:03.302
Hello?
Hello! Help!

30:08.207 --> 30:10.276
Detective Walsh?

30:10.376 --> 30:12.711
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.513
That <i>PDX</i> podcast.

30:14.613 --> 30:18.617
I listened to some of it
last night.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.920
I don't quite get
these armchair detectives.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.756
But I can tell you, um,

30:24.857 --> 30:29.061
that my boss at the time,
Police Chief Linton,

30:29.161 --> 30:31.397
was the kind of guy
who gave cops a bad name.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.933
Had a conviction quota,
liked to hand out

30:34.033 --> 30:36.002
pink slips
if he didn't get his way.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.670
I had a wife, three kids.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.708
Whatever I did at the time,

30:42.808 --> 30:44.877
I did it for them.

30:44.977 --> 30:50.082
Detective, the woman serving
a life sentence for this crime,

30:50.182 --> 30:52.618
Antonia, is also a mother.

30:52.718 --> 30:56.889
And her daughter, Kacey,
has grown up without her.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.958
I took this case

30:59.058 --> 31:01.593
because I believe in my heart

31:01.693 --> 31:04.063
that Antonia was innocent.

31:04.163 --> 31:08.234
But that belief took me away
from my own child.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.136
I'm still on the case,

31:10.236 --> 31:12.304
I still believe it.

31:12.404 --> 31:16.475
So if there's anything
that you know, anything at all,

31:16.575 --> 31:19.578
please, I'm begging you,
help me.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.685
There was a box of stuff
we picked up at the crime scene

31:26.785 --> 31:28.955
that we never
logged into evidence.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.722
Linton told me
to torch it,

31:30.822 --> 31:32.258
but I couldn't.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.559
What was in the box?

31:33.659 --> 31:35.694
I never looked.
If I'd have looked then,

31:35.794 --> 31:37.863
it would have haunted me.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.367
I don't even know
where that box is.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.609
Hello?! Hello!

31:50.709 --> 31:52.211
Wha...?

31:52.311 --> 31:54.346
Why is the door wedged shut?

31:54.446 --> 31:57.283
And why is this phone
screaming at me all night long?

31:57.383 --> 31:58.617
It's mine!

31:58.717 --> 32:01.020
Someone locked us in
and tried to cook us!

32:01.120 --> 32:04.290
Somebody must have accessed
the furnace remotely.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.857
I have a question.
Evelyn Wilder.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.893
Did her name used
to be Germaine Gulrench?

32:07.994 --> 32:10.596
Yeah. Then she became fancy
writer, and she changed it.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.398
Long time ago.
Is she home?

32:12.498 --> 32:14.800
No, she left about an hour ago.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.036
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

32:17.136 --> 32:19.038
13 years of work,

32:19.138 --> 32:21.340
13 years of prison
for Antonia

32:21.440 --> 32:24.443
just because one man
didn't want to look in a box.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.912
Just unbelievable.
It breaks my heart.

32:27.913 --> 32:30.349
Margaret, look.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.224
I just wanted to look you
in the eye and...

32:38.324 --> 32:40.692
say that I'm sorry.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.162
I found it.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.664
And I'm sorry
I didn't do this sooner.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.904
Detective Walsh, thank you.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.086
It's the...

33:08.087 --> 33:10.322
It's the murder weapon.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.064
Come on, come... How long does
it take to run a set of prints?

33:18.064 --> 33:19.798
Jack said he would
give us a call as soon

33:19.898 --> 33:22.068
as he knows something. How could
they hide the murder weapon?

33:22.068 --> 33:25.071
Why would anyone want to...?
It's what Walsh said.

33:25.071 --> 33:28.274
They have conviction quotas,
they cut corners.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.576
Antonia is found
covered in blood,

33:30.676 --> 33:33.112
she doesn't speak English,
so assumptions are made.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.114
Bang. She's the murderer.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.149
And how do you simplify a case?

33:37.249 --> 33:40.252
They get rid
of the murder weapon.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.154
You wanted me?

33:42.254 --> 33:44.123
Yeah, come on, come in. Uh,

33:44.223 --> 33:46.092
these papers seem very similar

33:46.092 --> 33:48.494
to the ones that Todd and Lea
found in Devin's apartment.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.529
What do you make of 'em?

33:50.629 --> 33:52.498
Is this...
Chinese?

33:52.598 --> 33:54.500
Must've been close to the body.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.502
There's a little
blood spatter here.
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

33:56.602 --> 33:59.238
I think Attorney Yang
reads Chinese. Hmm.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.776
Feel free
to read out loud.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.914
Oh, sorry. It's just
really romantic, actually.

34:10.749 --> 34:15.354
"May Washingdwen knew her life
would never be the same.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.256
"She stood at the cliff.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.458
Was she really going to meet
the man who broke her heart?"

34:21.760 --> 34:23.595
Please, keep reading.

34:23.695 --> 34:26.132
"May took two steps forward,

34:26.132 --> 34:28.300
"then two steps back.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.270
"She threw down
the lilac bouquet

34:31.370 --> 34:33.605
and ran into the stormy night."

34:34.373 --> 34:37.976
Google found duplicate text
to what you're translating.

34:38.144 --> 34:40.979
It looks like
it's some kind of story in a

34:41.147 --> 34:43.415
lit magazine published
13 years ago

34:43.515 --> 34:45.684
by someone named Evelyn Wilder?

34:45.784 --> 34:47.853
She's one of the suspects
in our case.

34:47.953 --> 34:51.923
But why would Raya have
Evelyn's story in her apartment?

34:52.023 --> 34:54.260
Maybe Raya was doing
the Chinese translation?

34:54.360 --> 34:55.827
But Evelyn speaks Chinese.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.663
Why would she need
a translation?

34:57.763 --> 34:59.565
That was Jack. The fingerprints

34:59.665 --> 35:01.733
on the murder weapon
match the fingerprints

35:01.833 --> 35:04.770
on the crime tape that was
delivered to your condo.

35:04.870 --> 35:08.174
But her prints aren't
in the system. No matches.

35:08.174 --> 35:11.177
We need to find Evelyn
and get her fingerprints

35:11.177 --> 35:13.179
as soon as possible.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.546
It's Todd.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.081
Oh, I can't read it.
I don't have my glasses on.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.985
"Mom. Mom. Seriously.
I need $18 for a sandwich."

35:20.085 --> 35:21.887
No. Scroll down. Scroll down.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.955
"Evelyn Wilder used
to be Germaine Gulrench.

35:24.055 --> 35:27.293
"Evelyn Wilder is her made-up
name, her pen name or whatever.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.994
"My battery is dying.
Ouch, I hit my knee.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.797
I'm using talk to text
hippopotamus." Oh, no, no.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.799
"Evelyn is doing a reading today
at Matchstix Books.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.567
Meet me there."

35:35.667 --> 35:37.803
Hippopotamus?
Lyle, Susan, you find out

35:37.903 --> 35:39.338
whatever you can
about these documents

35:39.438 --> 35:42.007
and this Germaine Gulrench,
and Francey, let's go.

35:42.107 --> 35:44.710
Matchstix Books. Let's go!

35:45.511 --> 35:47.413
Oh, there you are!

35:47.513 --> 35:48.914
You are filthy!

35:49.014 --> 35:50.516
Oh, God.
And you smell awful.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.684
Sorry, yeah, but we didn't
have time to freshen up

35:52.784 --> 35:54.220
because we almost died.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.554
Just a reminder--
I am recording all of this.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.223
Okay, just so you know,

35:57.223 --> 35:58.657
I've had several more death
threats since you were gone,

35:58.757 --> 36:00.326
so don't come crying
to me about...

36:00.426 --> 36:02.428
I'm not competing with you
about who came closer to death.

36:02.528 --> 36:03.895
It was me. Mm.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.231
Listen, Evelyn Wilder is...

36:05.331 --> 36:07.132
Germaine Gulrench.
We already know that.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.501
Are they always like this?
Okay, Counselor.

36:09.601 --> 36:10.769
But what you
might not know

36:10.869 --> 36:12.304
is that the reason
she changed her name

36:12.404 --> 36:14.540
is because Germaine Gulrench
was a terrible writer.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.543
The reviews of her work
were horrible. Truly horrible.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.545
And then, one week before
Raya was murdered,

36:19.645 --> 36:21.880
new writer Evelyn Wilder
was published

36:21.980 --> 36:23.449
to rave reviews.

36:23.549 --> 36:26.618
So Germaine stole Raya's work.
Is that what you're saying?

36:26.718 --> 36:28.887
That's exactly what I'm saying.
And when Raya found out...

36:28.987 --> 36:30.656
She confronted Germaine.
Aka Evelyn.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.624
And Evelyn...
Killed Raya.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.293
I love murder!

36:35.461 --> 36:37.396
I mean, solving it.

36:37.496 --> 36:42.067
"They had fought long and hard
for what they had built."

36:42.167 --> 36:43.702
Okay, come on.
Here's the plan.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.271
Todd, we have
the murder weapon,

36:45.271 --> 36:47.005
but I need you
to get her prints.
Got it.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.875
Francey, pull up
those horrible reviews. Okay.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.911
And, Lea, keep recording.
Don't miss a word.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.680
"And Mildred and Algernon

36:54.780 --> 36:57.516
"watched the sunset
over Belle Manor

36:57.616 --> 36:59.351
"for the first time...

36:59.451 --> 37:01.420
as husband and wife."

37:05.491 --> 37:07.593
Thank you so much.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.095
I'm happy to answer
any questions?

37:10.195 --> 37:11.363
Oh, I have a question.

37:11.463 --> 37:14.500
I am fascinated
with your stories.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.536
Tell me, Evelyn, where
do you get your inspiration?

37:17.636 --> 37:19.170
Thank you. Uh...

37:19.305 --> 37:22.974
I have been accused of having
a fantastical imagination.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.510
Next question.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.312
I'm sorry, can you just
clear up one thing for me?

37:26.312 --> 37:27.946
Do you write under a pen name?

37:28.046 --> 37:29.948
I had my name changed.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.651
Legally, for personal reasons. Next.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.453
And did that name change
have anything to do

37:34.553 --> 37:38.357
with your horrible reviews
as Germaine Gulrench?

37:39.525 --> 37:40.626
Here we go.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.961
"The excruciatingly
insecure prose

37:43.061 --> 37:44.496
"of Germaine Gulrench

37:44.596 --> 37:46.998
leads one down a confusing
path of drivel--"

37:47.098 --> 37:48.334
Stop talking!

37:48.334 --> 37:50.702
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.804
I'm talking about Raya Chen.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.640
You'd never understand.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.141
You're just some rich bitch

37:56.241 --> 37:58.009
who lives in a condo
with a doorman.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.879
Which you would know
because you delivered

38:00.979 --> 38:02.548
a death threat
to my condo.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.149
You stole Raya's work.

38:04.249 --> 38:05.216
I helped her!

38:05.351 --> 38:06.552
And then you murdered her...

38:06.652 --> 38:07.819
Oh!
...because her writing
was good

38:07.919 --> 38:09.020
and yours wasn't.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.055
And you let
an innocent woman

38:10.155 --> 38:11.490
serve <i>your</i> time in prison

38:11.590 --> 38:12.524
because you're a coward.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.792
And I suspect

38:13.892 --> 38:16.094
you murdered Devin
because he was onto you.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.496
You bitch!

38:17.596 --> 38:19.164
Hey! Wait.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.166
Someone stop her.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.701
You don't understand!

38:22.801 --> 38:24.370
I gave her work to the world!

38:24.370 --> 38:26.438
And you've given us more
than enough evidence

38:26.538 --> 38:27.939
to reopen the case

38:28.039 --> 38:29.875
with these recorded confessions.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.276
And these prints should match

38:31.377 --> 38:33.244
the ones on the murder
weapon perfectly.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.946
And you'll have
more than enough time

38:35.046 --> 38:37.916
to write something
original in prison.

38:46.692 --> 38:47.759
I hereby move

38:47.859 --> 38:49.861
that Antonia Suarez's
conviction

38:49.961 --> 38:51.697
be vacated with prejudice

38:51.797 --> 38:53.399
and a new trial be set

38:53.499 --> 38:55.634
by the People against
Evelyn Wilder.

38:55.734 --> 38:56.635
Thank you, Your Honor.

38:58.203 --> 39:01.407
‚ô™ All of this time you got
in front of you ‚ô™

39:01.407 --> 39:02.641
13 years.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.178
We have to tell Kacey.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.716
Way to go.

39:10.816 --> 39:14.920
‚ô™ Nothing alive can see
the way you do ‚ô™

39:15.020 --> 39:16.087
Mom?

39:16.187 --> 39:17.823
My baby...

39:22.160 --> 39:23.995
We did it.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.764
The podcast helped.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.766
‚ô™ Time ‚ô™

39:29.200 --> 39:31.470
Oh, did you get the...?
Oh, yeah.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.609
Thank you.

39:47.453 --> 39:51.757
‚ô™ Time to feel ‚ô™

39:51.857 --> 39:55.293
‚ô™ The space in you ‚ô™

39:57.729 --> 39:58.797
‚ô™ Time... ‚ô™

39:58.897 --> 40:02.200
So, did you get
everything you need?

40:02.300 --> 40:03.535
I did. Yeah.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.604
I think this is
gonna be an amazing

40:05.704 --> 40:06.738
series of episodes.

40:06.838 --> 40:10.576
So, what about like,
another date?

40:10.676 --> 40:12.844
Sometime, you know,
without the furnace

40:12.944 --> 40:14.245
and someone
trying to kill us.

40:14.345 --> 40:15.847
You know,
I didn't really mind

40:15.947 --> 40:17.248
the danger part of it.

40:17.348 --> 40:18.884
Switching things up,

40:18.984 --> 40:20.085
fighting for our lives.

40:20.185 --> 40:21.753
Made for
pretty good material.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.655
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.592
Yeah?
Yeah, let's,
let's do that date

40:26.692 --> 40:28.694
when I get back
from my next podcast

40:28.794 --> 40:30.395
in Portland.

40:30.496 --> 40:33.031
Maine.
Huh...

40:33.131 --> 40:36.001
But, uh...

40:36.968 --> 40:39.170
you want to keep this for me
till I get back?

40:39.270 --> 40:40.438
Your jimmy kit thing?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.207
Seriously?
What if you need it?

40:42.307 --> 40:45.176
Oh, that's just
my back-up kit.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.549
Bye, Todd.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.752
‚ô™ You got in front of you ‚ô™

40:53.852 --> 40:55.253
Bye, Lea.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.191
‚ô™ Come with me ‚ô™

41:00.291 --> 41:01.993
‚ô™ Together... ‚ô™

41:02.093 --> 41:03.762
She was totally into me.
Oh, my God.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.296
And when she gets
back from Maine,

41:05.396 --> 41:07.165
we're gonna hang out. Oh...

41:07.265 --> 41:08.366
What?
Look over there.

41:11.069 --> 41:12.370
Happy birthday, Todd.

41:13.539 --> 41:16.207
Retroactively.
Thank you.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.710
"Just 18 In Blue"?
Okay.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.279
That's what I told them
I wanted it to say.

41:21.379 --> 41:22.948
Just "18," in blue.

41:23.048 --> 41:25.617
But it doesn't matter.
It is your favorite.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.920
It's chocolate cake
and vanilla frosting.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.121
From your favorite place.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.357
Okay, blow it out?
Yes.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.292
Yeah.
Okay.

41:36.361 --> 41:38.329
Yay!

41:38.429 --> 41:39.565
Todd is 18.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.399
Are you kidding me?

41:41.567 --> 41:44.703
I am so sorry I missed it.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.205
Okay, let's just cut the cake.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.774
Mom, wait. Listen.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.576
I...

41:50.576 --> 41:51.943
I didn't realize back then

41:52.043 --> 41:54.179
how important
what you were doing was.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.413
And I'm...

41:55.581 --> 41:58.316
Well, I just...

41:58.416 --> 42:00.852
I'm really proud to be your son.

42:01.653 --> 42:04.055
And this actually means--
Can we stop

42:04.155 --> 42:05.090
Hallmark Carding

42:05.190 --> 42:06.491
and eat the cake?
Sure.

42:06.592 --> 42:08.126
I thought you were
doing a joke.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.928
I thought that was a bit.
No, no,
I wasn't joking--

42:10.028 --> 42:11.697
Oh, hey, hey,
hold on a second.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.364
Lea's podcast
just dropped.

42:13.464 --> 42:14.633
Just save it...

42:16.334 --> 42:18.670
Wait, you can hear...

42:18.770 --> 42:20.706
You can put that
from your phone to my speakers?

42:20.806 --> 42:22.440
Yeah, you have
a state-of-the-art sound system,

42:22.608 --> 42:23.609
Mom.
Shush. Listen.

42:23.709 --> 42:24.876
We all remember

42:24.976 --> 42:26.678
different versions
of every story.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.747
But maybe the most

42:28.847 --> 42:32.183
important thing
is that we remember.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.487
We may not recall
every detail perfectly,

42:36.622 --> 42:38.423
but in remembering,

42:38.523 --> 42:41.660
we can keep people
and memories alive.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.033
Margaret and Francey
never let anyone forget

42:48.133 --> 42:50.902
the story of a wrongfully
convicted woman.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.705
And tonight,

42:53.805 --> 42:56.842
because of them,
Antonia Suarez is free.
