03:51.797 --> 03:53.492
Edith.

03:56.535 --> 03:58.833
It's been so long.

03:59.171 --> 04:00.798
A lifetime.

04:00.972 --> 04:02.997
Drive home with me.

04:04.009 --> 04:08.469
Come on, Edith. Drive home with me.
We can catch up.

04:09.347 --> 04:12.475
- Why not?
- How very nice of you.

04:12.651 --> 04:15.620
I want to hear all about you.

04:23.495 --> 04:26.658
Henry, Mrs. DeLorca is just driving up.

04:48.887 --> 04:51.583
- Thank you, Paul. I won't ask you in.
- I understand.

04:51.756 --> 04:54.190
I must get back to the office.
See you tonight.

04:54.359 --> 04:57.226
- George, you can wait here for my sister.
- Yes, madam.

04:57.562 --> 04:59.826
Can I bring your car around,
Mr. Harrison?

04:59.998 --> 05:02.967
Would madam care for anything?
Tea? A drink, perhaps?

05:03.135 --> 05:07.231
Some tea, thank you. And, Henry,
I don't want to be disturbed.

05:07.405 --> 05:10.203
- Certainly, madam.
- Come on, Edie.

05:11.343 --> 05:13.573
May I have your coat, please?

05:24.923 --> 05:27.483
Depressing, isn't it?

05:29.394 --> 05:31.919
Frank's father built it.

05:33.765 --> 05:36.131
And the stairs are such a bore.

05:46.978 --> 05:48.673
Duke can't bear me.

05:49.347 --> 05:51.611
And vice versa.

05:59.891 --> 06:02.189
Close the door, will you, Edie?

06:02.360 --> 06:06.296
Sit down and make yourself comfortable.

06:07.766 --> 06:09.859
Thank God that's over.

06:10.035 --> 06:12.970
I hate black.
I don't look well in black.

06:19.611 --> 06:23.103
You're not seeing a ghost.
Janet, this is my twin sister Edith.

06:23.782 --> 06:26.649
- How do you do?
- I said I didn't want to be disturbed.

06:26.818 --> 06:29.753
I'm sorry, madam.
This package was delivered for you.

06:29.921 --> 06:31.718
Thank you, Janet.

06:34.826 --> 06:37.056
Excuse me, Edith.

06:52.077 --> 06:54.671
I sent this out to be cleaned
before Frank died.

06:55.447 --> 06:58.382
For someone whose husband
was buried today...

06:58.550 --> 07:00.415
you don't seem to be very upset.

07:00.585 --> 07:05.318
Edie, don't be like this.
It was all so long ago.

07:06.157 --> 07:08.352
Why did you ask me to come here?

07:09.427 --> 07:12.863
Edie, don't be offended, but...

07:13.031 --> 07:15.932
Well, when I saw you
at the cemetery, I mean...

07:16.101 --> 07:19.867
- Well, look what you're wearing.
- Are you offering me money or castoffs?

07:20.038 --> 07:22.199
Castoffs?

07:22.374 --> 07:25.775
Edie, darling,
wait till you see my castoffs.

07:25.944 --> 07:29.072
There's... There's this.

07:30.181 --> 07:32.115
And this.

07:33.985 --> 07:35.816
And this.

07:35.987 --> 07:38.979
They'll all be out of style
before I'm out of mourning.

07:39.691 --> 07:44.628
Here's something that will really
do something for you.

07:46.598 --> 07:49.396
Here's the most divine one of them all.

07:49.567 --> 07:52.058
I bought it in Paris only a year ago.

07:52.237 --> 07:54.762
Right off a model at Dior's.

07:54.939 --> 07:59.569
No bargain, believe me.
It's a perfect color for you.

08:00.779 --> 08:03.714
You can have them all, if you wish.

08:09.554 --> 08:14.389
Use this. You shouldn't smoke. It's bad
for your skin. I gave it up years ago.

08:14.559 --> 08:17.756
- What did you drop on Frank's coffin?
- Heather.

08:17.929 --> 08:20.227
A sprig of heather for...

08:20.398 --> 08:22.559
For auld lang syne.

08:22.734 --> 08:24.326
Heather?

08:24.502 --> 08:28.131
Oh, of course.
A weekend in Scotland once.

08:28.306 --> 08:31.002
- our last weekend.
- Yes, Frank told me about it.

08:33.378 --> 08:35.312
Come in, Henry.

08:40.652 --> 08:44.019
Why do you care about all this
at this late date?

08:44.188 --> 08:45.918
I do, and he did.

08:46.124 --> 08:49.719
Well, not too much, Edie.

08:52.764 --> 08:54.664
Have some tea.

08:56.634 --> 09:01.298
You never have faced the fact it was
only one of those wartime romances.

09:01.473 --> 09:07.469
Handsome colonel meets willing
WAC lieutenant on leave in London.

09:07.712 --> 09:09.680
What do you want in your tea?

09:09.848 --> 09:11.110
Just plain, thank you.

09:11.282 --> 09:15.480
Oh, Edie. It all sounds so silly now.

09:17.122 --> 09:19.283
And how was it with you?

09:19.557 --> 09:24.688
Same handsome colonel
on a stopover in Los Angeles...

09:24.863 --> 09:26.797
calls WAC's sister.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.660
I knew I was an idiot
to give him your address.

09:31.836 --> 09:35.294
He wanted to do something nice for me.

09:36.841 --> 09:41.335
- Where is the child? Away at college?
- What are you talking about?

09:41.579 --> 09:44.605
The child that made it necessary
for Frank to marry you.

09:44.783 --> 09:47.684
Well, he died when he was less
than a year old.

09:47.852 --> 09:49.615
Poor Frank.

09:49.921 --> 09:53.652
He wanted children.
Matter of fact, he wanted a boy.

09:53.825 --> 09:56.623
Well, you see, I couldn't have any more.

09:56.795 --> 09:58.660
Unzip me, will you?

09:58.830 --> 10:01.196
I want to get out of these things.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.697
God, how I hate mourning.

10:03.868 --> 10:06.530
Did you see those characters
at the funeral?

10:06.704 --> 10:09.605
Old California up to their stiff necks.

10:09.774 --> 10:12.004
Do you know how long
I have to wear black?

10:12.177 --> 10:14.873
Louses things up for you,
doesn't it, Maggie?

10:15.046 --> 10:17.207
You're really broken up. I can see that.

10:41.239 --> 10:44.333
When are you going back
to San Francisco?

10:47.111 --> 10:50.512
I haven't lived in San Francisco
for 10 years.

10:50.782 --> 10:52.977
Not since father died...

10:53.151 --> 10:54.880
a wino.

10:55.053 --> 10:57.453
- A wino?
- Yes. He drank wine...

10:57.622 --> 11:00.750
because he couldn't afford
to buy whiskey anymore.

11:00.925 --> 11:06.022
After he was fired off the Express and every
other newspaper west of the Rockies.

11:06.197 --> 11:08.927
They finally took him away
in a straitjacket.

11:09.367 --> 11:13.428
Oh, Edie, how awful! Poor father.

11:13.605 --> 11:18.304
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- Well, I did let you know about the funeral.

11:18.476 --> 11:22.913
- But you didn't come, somehow.
- We must have been in Europe.

11:23.081 --> 11:26.016
Frank and I traveled
a lot in those days.

11:27.485 --> 11:29.180
I know.

11:32.524 --> 11:36.119
- What do you mean?
- My favorite reading all these years...

11:36.294 --> 11:40.230
has been the social activities
of that distinguished couple...

11:40.398 --> 11:41.831
the Frank DeLorcas.

11:42.267 --> 11:46.533
- And seeing them occasionally.
- Where do you live now?

11:46.704 --> 11:48.399
In L.A.

11:48.573 --> 11:51.804
In Los Angeles? For the past 10 years?

11:51.976 --> 11:58.643
Yes. I have a cocktail lounge
on Figueroa street called Edie's.

11:58.816 --> 12:00.716
A cocktail lounge?

12:00.885 --> 12:04.514
- Now, why didn't you ask me...?
- For the fare out of town?

12:05.323 --> 12:07.917
The last time I left Los Angeles...

12:08.092 --> 12:11.653
you met me at the station with the news
that you were pregnant...

12:11.829 --> 12:15.526
- ...and that Frank was marrying you.
- Oh, but that was 20 years ago.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.964
To be exact, 18.

12:18.269 --> 12:23.138
You really hate me, don't you?
You've never forgiven me in all these years.

12:23.308 --> 12:25.173
Why should I? Tell me why I should.

12:25.343 --> 12:28.278
- Well, we're sisters.
- So we are.

12:28.446 --> 12:30.812
And to hell with you!

13:02.547 --> 13:07.575
He was a handsome man, madam.
Mr. DeLorca was also a fine man.

13:07.752 --> 13:10.243
He will never be replaced
in this house...

13:10.421 --> 13:12.218
in our hearts.

13:25.637 --> 13:27.434
Thank you, Henry.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.345
Where to, ma'am?

13:45.189 --> 13:46.986
Figueroa.

13:47.325 --> 13:50.817
- Figueroa and Temple.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:52.864 --> 13:56.265
Edie's bar. Indian territory.

13:56.601 --> 13:59.126
DeLorca territory, too, ma'am.

13:59.303 --> 14:02.761
The family owned most all that section
in the old days.

14:02.940 --> 14:05.568
But that's the way it goes
with the old families.

14:05.743 --> 14:08.337
Bit by bit, they sell off the land.

14:09.847 --> 14:15.183
But I never would have thought that I'd live
to see the last of the DeLorcas to the grave.

14:15.853 --> 14:19.721
And me with seven grandchildren.
All boys.

14:20.425 --> 14:23.292
And his only son died.

14:24.362 --> 14:25.852
Ma'am?

14:26.030 --> 14:29.397
I said Mr. DeLorca's only son died.

14:29.567 --> 14:33.799
Ma'am, there's been no child born
or died in the DeLorca family...

14:33.971 --> 14:37.429
boy or girl, that I know of.

14:39.577 --> 14:44.014
- of course, that was 20 years ago.
- Twenty years, ma'am?

14:44.182 --> 14:47.845
It's been 40 years and more
I've been driving the DeLorca family.

14:48.019 --> 14:50.852
If they'd had a child,
I'd have known about it.

14:53.725 --> 14:58.219
They never had a child, a boy,
when they were first married?

14:58.629 --> 15:00.221
They certainly did not, ma'am.

15:02.633 --> 15:05.693
- Perhaps they were away when it happened.
- No, ma'am.

15:05.870 --> 15:09.328
That first year, the first two
or three years they were married...

15:09.507 --> 15:12.032
as I remember well,
they never left here.

15:12.877 --> 15:18.338
Mr. DeLorca said he'd shifted around enough
in the service to last him for quite a while.

15:43.307 --> 15:46.333
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

15:59.757 --> 16:02.351
Beemis called. He told me
to say he'd be in later.

16:02.527 --> 16:04.620
He said you'd know what it's all about.

16:04.796 --> 16:08.061
- You look beat.
- I am. I'd like a drink.

16:08.666 --> 16:11.999
Hi there, Edie. I have something
that will interest you.

16:12.170 --> 16:13.865
I doubt it.

16:14.205 --> 16:16.867
- Sweepstake tickets.
- Thanks.

16:17.041 --> 16:20.169
Come on, now, Edie.
You could get lucky. You never know.

16:20.378 --> 16:22.039
I know.

16:32.757 --> 16:35.021
- How much?
- Three bucks apiece.

16:35.193 --> 16:38.219
- You can make a nice piece of change.
- Let me have a look.

16:38.396 --> 16:41.422
- Think they ain't genuine?
- Look, I never said that.

16:41.599 --> 16:42.998
Cop.

16:43.901 --> 16:46.131
- Hi, sarge. How's my pigeon?
- She upstairs?

16:46.304 --> 16:49.501
- You like the Rams Sunday?
- Any Sunday.

17:21.172 --> 17:23.196
Edie? Jim.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.506
Come on in, Jim.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.802
The door's unlocked.

17:29.647 --> 17:32.207
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:36.587 --> 17:38.452
Happy birthday.

17:38.756 --> 17:40.587
Happy birthday?

17:49.767 --> 17:52.031
Oh, that's so funny.

17:52.503 --> 17:54.164
I'd completely forgotten.

17:54.338 --> 17:58.866
I am the type never forgets birthdays,
anniversaries or Christmas Day.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.777
Open it up.

18:00.945 --> 18:04.142
Don't you want to see the prize
you get for living this long?

18:04.548 --> 18:10.248
Oh, Jim, it was so sweet of you
to remember my birthday.

18:10.421 --> 18:11.683
I got you cigars.

18:12.156 --> 18:15.922
Your birthday, and you're buying me cigars.
I thank you.

18:24.035 --> 18:26.299
A watch.

18:26.737 --> 18:28.705
Jim, you shouldn't have.

18:28.873 --> 18:31.398
Now, don't tell me
what I should or shouldn't.

18:31.909 --> 18:33.342
Let me put it on for you.

18:43.587 --> 18:45.612
What's the matter? Don't you like it?

18:46.991 --> 18:51.087
- You big fool.
- Well, does that mean you like it?

18:52.596 --> 18:53.824
Of course I like it.

18:53.998 --> 18:56.899
Well, then what are you crying for,
for crying out loud?

18:57.068 --> 18:59.195
Oh, you dope.

19:00.338 --> 19:02.135
Have a drink.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.137
I'm still on duty.

19:08.079 --> 19:11.947
You don't have a birthday
every day, do you?

19:12.183 --> 19:15.243
- No, not for me.
- All right.

19:21.826 --> 19:23.384
Many of them.

19:29.967 --> 19:33.528
Say, I thought maybe this Sunday
we could drive out to the valley...

19:33.704 --> 19:35.899
take a look at that egg ranch.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.674
Egg ranch?

19:40.845 --> 19:45.282
For Pete's sake, Edie. That's all
I've been talking about for months.

19:49.286 --> 19:52.346
Oh, yes. Of course you have.

19:52.957 --> 19:55.755
- Something wrong?
- No, not a thing.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.860
- You in some kind of trouble?
- I just told you no, Jim.

20:06.504 --> 20:09.029
Now, you wouldn't hold out on me,
would you?

20:09.206 --> 20:11.606
Edie, if there's anything
I can do, anything.

20:11.776 --> 20:14.404
Nothing. Nothing at all.

20:15.646 --> 20:17.841
Then what happened this afternoon?

20:18.916 --> 20:20.781
I went to a funeral.

20:24.855 --> 20:26.345
Relative?

20:27.058 --> 20:28.821
But close, huh?

20:33.731 --> 20:35.926
That sort of gets next to you. I know.

20:36.100 --> 20:39.399
One day you've got it made.
The next day, bing! Just like that.

20:39.570 --> 20:42.630
- You don't know what hit you.
- Oh, stop it, Jim!

20:44.708 --> 20:46.369
I'm sorry.

20:47.478 --> 20:49.105
Look...

20:49.747 --> 20:54.684
if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go downstairs and see Danny.

20:57.655 --> 20:59.384
Okay.

21:15.106 --> 21:17.404
Boy, am I glad
I'm not in homicide anymore.

21:17.575 --> 21:21.671
Chickens and eggs will look just great
to me when I get my retirement.

21:22.713 --> 21:25.011
And I don't care which came first.

21:25.182 --> 21:28.345
It's lovely, Jim. Much too good for me.

21:28.519 --> 21:30.248
Don't say that.

21:30.421 --> 21:33.322
Nothing is too good for you,
and I mean that.

21:33.891 --> 21:35.825
I know you do.

21:39.096 --> 21:40.825
So long, Edie. See you.

21:40.998 --> 21:42.226
Jim.

21:42.399 --> 21:46.597
Jim, take me out tonight. To a movie,
anywhere. Anywhere! Just so I can get out.

21:46.770 --> 21:49.933
Well, now, do you know what?
I had planned to do just that.

21:50.107 --> 21:52.598
- You're a doll.
- Wait, you didn't let me finish.

21:52.776 --> 21:54.937
Joe is sick, and Ben and I got the duty.

21:55.513 --> 21:59.279
I know it's a lousy break because
it's your birthday, but what can I do?

22:00.117 --> 22:01.880
It doesn't matter.

22:02.052 --> 22:03.644
See you.

22:09.260 --> 22:10.750
Hi, Jim.

22:22.373 --> 22:24.000
Edie?

22:32.850 --> 22:34.977
I called you earlier.

22:37.254 --> 22:39.916
Sorry, but you're behind again.

22:40.191 --> 22:42.386
- I know.
- It's not like I never told you.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.687
Month in and month out, I've warned you.

22:44.862 --> 22:47.854
This combo.
You can't afford to pay musicians.

22:48.032 --> 22:50.694
Handouts to every bum on the street.

22:51.235 --> 22:54.636
All right, it's your business.
All right. Rent is mine.

22:54.805 --> 22:57.205
And this time,
you're three months behind.

22:57.741 --> 23:00.642
Mrs. Beemis has a brother,
and he's in from Cleveland.

23:00.811 --> 23:02.870
Been in the bar business all his life.

23:03.047 --> 23:07.245
He's willing to give me
one year's rent in advance.

23:08.452 --> 23:10.215
Are you listening?

23:12.122 --> 23:14.852
- oh, yes. Yes.
- So I gotta tell you...

23:15.025 --> 23:17.960
I want you out of here
by the end of the month.

23:21.432 --> 23:24.094
And don't tell me you've got a lease.

23:24.268 --> 23:27.760
Read it. You're in default.

23:44.622 --> 23:47.182
Can I have the number for Frank DeLorca?

23:47.358 --> 23:49.918
DeLorca Drive, West Los Angeles.

23:59.169 --> 24:01.296
Mrs. DeLorca, please.

24:02.706 --> 24:04.571
Her sister Edith.

24:08.512 --> 24:10.173
Margaret.

24:10.547 --> 24:12.310
This is Edith.

24:13.017 --> 24:18.182
- I want you to come down here right away.
- Oh, darling, I simply can't right now.

24:18.956 --> 24:20.617
I know everything, Margaret.

24:21.492 --> 24:24.052
- What?
- I said I know everything...

24:24.228 --> 24:26.924
and I'm telling you
to come down here right away.

24:27.097 --> 24:30.931
- Would you rather I came there?
- Oh, no. No, I wouldn't.

24:31.468 --> 24:34.369
That's what I thought.
Be here in an hour.

24:34.672 --> 24:35.969
George knows the way.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.467
Edith?

24:45.683 --> 24:47.913
I'm sorry, Carl. I'll have to leave.

24:48.085 --> 24:49.780
Janet will call you.

24:52.556 --> 24:54.421
- You've drawn my bath?
- Yes, madam.

24:54.591 --> 24:57.788
- The rosary, madam, at 8:00.
- I'll be back in plenty of time.

25:06.303 --> 25:09.864
He's a louse, that Beemis.
"The end of the month."

25:10.040 --> 25:11.268
That's the way it goes.

25:11.442 --> 25:15.572
Dan, my sister, Mrs. DeLorca, will be
coming here in an hour. Show her up.

25:15.746 --> 25:17.145
Will do.

28:11.255 --> 28:14.053
I'm Mrs. DeLorca.
Where will I find Miss Phillips?

28:14.224 --> 28:15.953
This way, ma'am.

28:22.766 --> 28:24.893
Up those stairs, ma'am.

28:35.846 --> 28:37.404
Edith?

28:37.648 --> 28:39.639
It's Margaret.

28:43.754 --> 28:45.346
Edith.

28:45.522 --> 28:47.547
I hear you.

28:59.469 --> 29:00.902
Come in.

29:16.787 --> 29:18.379
A dump?

29:23.961 --> 29:26.259
Why did you ask me to come here?

29:26.430 --> 29:28.921
Told you to come here.

29:29.099 --> 29:32.728
Take off your coat and hat.
Phony mourning makes me sick.

29:32.903 --> 29:34.564
Frank is dead, you know.

29:34.738 --> 29:39.141
You don't mourn him, because you never
loved him. I said, take off your hat and coat.

29:48.552 --> 29:50.986
How do you like my new hairdo?

29:51.288 --> 29:52.585
It suits you.

29:52.956 --> 29:55.220
Well, if it suits you,
it should suit me.

29:55.392 --> 29:59.556
- We're twins, aren't we?
- What exactly does that mean?

30:04.668 --> 30:08.536
Tell me more about that baby of yours,
the one who died so young.

30:08.705 --> 30:12.141
- Why are you so interested?
- He could have been mine.

30:12.943 --> 30:16.071
Aren't you overly morbid about all this?

30:20.217 --> 30:21.479
What was his name?

30:24.087 --> 30:27.921
- Frank DeLorca III.
- Well, I should have known that.

30:28.592 --> 30:30.389
How old was he when he died?

30:31.862 --> 30:34.126
- Less than a year.
- How many months?

30:34.297 --> 30:36.822
Edith, I won't be
cross-examined like this.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.763
How many months?!

30:42.305 --> 30:43.738
Seven.

30:44.675 --> 30:45.972
What did he die of?

31:03.827 --> 31:05.795
All right, Edie.

31:11.735 --> 31:13.930
There never was a baby.

31:14.104 --> 31:17.938
- That's what you want to hear, isn't it?
- That's what I had to hear.

31:18.108 --> 31:19.700
From you.

31:20.844 --> 31:23.176
- Who told you?
- What difference does it make?

31:23.480 --> 31:26.142
Edie, I wanted to marry Frank
so desperately.

31:26.316 --> 31:30.343
But you never loved him. You never made
him happy. You ruined both our lives.

31:31.021 --> 31:34.252
I'll make it up to you. Remember?

31:34.424 --> 31:38.690
Remember when we were children?
You were the one person I really loved.

31:38.862 --> 31:42.389
Loved!
You never loved anybody but yourself.

31:42.566 --> 31:46.127
You have all the time in the world
to find happiness.

31:46.303 --> 31:50.467
You can get rid of this place.
You can get rid of it and take a trip.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.268
- To outer space?
- Money's no object.

31:53.443 --> 31:57.709
- How much would you like?
- You haven't got that much!

31:57.881 --> 31:59.849
Now, sit down!

32:14.798 --> 32:17.790
This is why I told you to come here.

34:19.422 --> 34:21.889
- Be right out, Ben.
- Take your time.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.802
Sergeant. She's got company.

34:35.772 --> 34:39.139
- What do you mean, company?
- Her sister.

34:42.145 --> 34:44.636
Well, I got to go up to see her anyway.

35:03.767 --> 35:05.997
Edie? Jim.

35:09.239 --> 35:11.366
Yes, Jim?

35:11.808 --> 35:14.572
Only take a sec, Edie.
It's about tonight.

35:25.989 --> 35:29.117
I can't ask you in, Jim.
I'm not dressed.

35:29.292 --> 35:30.691
Well...

35:30.860 --> 35:32.327
I fixed it for tonight.

35:32.495 --> 35:36.932
Charlie said he'd take my extra duty an hour
from now, so we can go and celebrate.

35:37.100 --> 35:40.501
Well, I won't be able to go now.
My sister's here.

35:40.670 --> 35:44.401
- Edie. What's the matter, Edie?
- Nothing. Nothing at all, Jim.

36:48.071 --> 36:49.538
Edie owes three months' rent?

36:49.706 --> 36:53.301
That's right, so out we go
the end of the month.

36:53.476 --> 36:54.841
He won't give her a break?

36:55.011 --> 36:57.104
If you ask me, he is giving her a break.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.111
Edie's a soft touch, sergeant...

36:59.282 --> 37:03.343
and take it from me,
a soft touch is a bad risk.

39:35.805 --> 39:39.605
Look at those crazy noisemakers.
What can they do better than a jukebox?

39:39.776 --> 39:42.006
They're good kids.
She gives them a chance.

39:42.178 --> 39:45.306
- They bring in the trade, don't they?
- What kind of trade?

39:45.548 --> 39:49.348
That kind of trade doesn't drink
one short beer a night. Am I right?

39:50.653 --> 39:53.645
I'm going up. Maybe I can help.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.165
Remember, Maggie,
that crazy song we used to sing?

40:20.083 --> 40:22.711
Jim. Code three.

40:23.086 --> 40:24.314
I'll be right with you.

43:04.013 --> 43:05.776
Good night, ma'am.

43:15.825 --> 43:17.383
Home, madam?

44:07.643 --> 44:09.474
Good night, madam.

44:13.382 --> 44:14.906
Good evening.

44:19.655 --> 44:21.282
Margaret.

44:22.892 --> 44:24.883
We were all getting anxious.

44:48.584 --> 44:49.983
I'm...

44:50.553 --> 44:53.113
I'm sorry I was delayed.

45:10.106 --> 45:12.700
Your rosary and handkerchief, madam.

45:14.744 --> 45:16.177
Thank you.

45:32.028 --> 45:37.466
Margaret, my dear, we have been
waiting a very long time.

45:55.651 --> 46:00.918
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

46:02.892 --> 46:07.056
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
creator of heaven and earth...

46:07.229 --> 46:10.426
and in Jesus Christ,
his only son, our Lord...

46:10.600 --> 46:14.832
who was conceived by the Holy Ghost
born of the virgin Mary...

46:15.004 --> 46:19.771
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and buried.

46:19.942 --> 46:24.276
He descended into hell.
The third day, he rose again from the dead.

46:24.447 --> 46:29.942
He ascended into heaven and sitteth at
the right hand of God the Father Almighty.

46:30.152 --> 46:34.714
From thence he shall come to judge
the living and the dead.

46:35.925 --> 46:37.984
You've had a very trying day, Margaret.

46:38.160 --> 46:42.722
Time will heal, and the consolations
of religion sustain.

46:42.898 --> 46:46.061
When you're able,
we'll go into matters pending.

46:46.235 --> 46:47.998
Margaret, my dear.

46:48.170 --> 46:51.970
We must pray together again tomorrow
and have a long talk.

46:52.141 --> 46:55.304
It is not good to be too much alone
at times like these.

46:55.478 --> 46:59.346
Even a distant member of the family
is better than no one.

47:05.421 --> 47:09.118
Who would have thought
Margaret would take it so hard?

47:09.458 --> 47:12.894
There is a remedy for everything
but death.

47:13.129 --> 47:17.498
Alfonso can quote Cervantes
for all occasions.

47:17.667 --> 47:20.898
Let us go. Good night, Henry.

47:37.920 --> 47:40.320
Madam must be terribly tired.

47:40.489 --> 47:43.754
I've drawn a bath for you
and ordered a tray sent up.

47:47.329 --> 47:52.289
- Leave me alone, will you, Janet?
- Yes, madam.

48:04.113 --> 48:06.547
I asked you to leave me alone, Janet.

48:06.716 --> 48:08.445
Yes, madam.

50:38.500 --> 50:41.264
Duke, you can't be in here.

50:47.977 --> 50:49.706
You got to go.

50:50.112 --> 50:51.545
Come on. Come on.

50:56.318 --> 50:57.751
That's it.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.218
Duke. Duke, come here.

51:03.726 --> 51:06.524
Come, Duke. I'm terribly sorry, madam.

52:18.170 --> 52:21.628
- Madam, Henry wanted me to tell...
- Would you bring me a cigarette?

52:21.807 --> 52:24.605
- Cigarette?
- You'll find some in Mr. DeLorca's room.

52:25.110 --> 52:26.577
Yes, madam.

52:36.588 --> 52:37.919
Janet, come on. Hurry up.

52:49.468 --> 52:52.437
What did Henry want you to tell me?

52:52.604 --> 52:54.731
That the police are downstairs.

52:54.907 --> 52:58.934
Henry told them you weren't up,
but they said they didn't mind waiting.

53:03.182 --> 53:06.481
Did Henry tell you
what the police wanted?

53:06.652 --> 53:08.313
No, madam.

53:12.858 --> 53:15.622
Tell Henry I'll be down
as soon as I'm dressed.

53:15.794 --> 53:17.284
Yes, madam.

53:45.791 --> 53:47.281
Duke, come here.

53:47.893 --> 53:49.554
Come here, Duke.

53:50.162 --> 53:51.789
Stay.

54:00.606 --> 54:05.043
- Where are the police, Henry?
- They're waiting in the living room, madam.

54:14.086 --> 54:17.783
- Why don't you bring them in here?
- Yes, madam.

54:25.497 --> 54:29.365
I've changed my mind.
I'll see them in there.

54:40.178 --> 54:41.406
Good morning.

54:41.580 --> 54:44.981
Mrs. DeLorca, I'm Sergeant Garcia.
Sergeant Haywood.

54:45.150 --> 54:46.777
How do you do?

54:48.587 --> 54:52.421
We're here concerning your sister
who had a cocktail lounge on Figueroa.

54:52.991 --> 54:55.755
She was found dead
in her room last night.

54:57.896 --> 54:59.124
But...

54:59.298 --> 55:01.323
that's just impossible.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.127
I was with her last night.

55:03.835 --> 55:08.169
She took her own life.
There's a suicide note written to you.

55:09.341 --> 55:10.638
That's horrible.

55:10.943 --> 55:14.401
We're very sorry to have to put you
through this, Mrs. DeLorca...

55:14.580 --> 55:17.378
but the coroner requires
that you identify her body.

55:17.549 --> 55:19.016
Oh, no.

55:19.885 --> 55:25.255
- oh, no, I just couldn't do that.
- I'm afraid you'll have to.

55:25.424 --> 55:27.585
Captain Johnson
of Homicide will see you.

55:27.759 --> 55:31.160
There's a couple of things to clear up
so he can close the case.

55:33.131 --> 55:37.090
What could I clear up? I don't know
anything about my sister's affairs.

55:37.536 --> 55:41.597
As far as we know, you were
the last person to see Miss Phillips alive.

55:44.443 --> 55:49.107
Very well. I'll be ready to go with you
in a few minutes.

55:58.924 --> 56:01.916
Edie never talked about
her family, captain.

56:02.094 --> 56:05.029
I didn't even know she had a sister
until last night.

56:05.197 --> 56:07.563
Dan told me she was up
in the room with her.

56:07.733 --> 56:11.134
- When I went up there...
- I have Mrs. DeLorca, captain.

56:11.303 --> 56:13.032
Ask her in.

56:16.708 --> 56:19.074
Captain Johnson, Mrs. DeLorca.

56:19.244 --> 56:20.472
How do you do?

56:23.515 --> 56:27.212
This is Sergeant Hopson,
a friend of your sister.

56:30.455 --> 56:33.481
- How do you do?
- Please sit down.

56:37.896 --> 56:43.129
I know this must be quite a shock to you,
especially since you just lost your husband.

56:43.301 --> 56:45.633
I'll keep it as brief as possible.

56:46.071 --> 56:50.098
Just for the record, you did have
a sister named Edith Phillips?

56:50.275 --> 56:52.072
Yes, I did.

56:52.411 --> 56:55.437
Sergeant Hopson knew Miss Phillips
for some years...

56:55.614 --> 56:58.583
her bartender, Daniel Lister, too.

56:58.784 --> 57:03.380
They both say they never remember her
mentioning having a sister until yesterday.

57:03.622 --> 57:07.251
Well, we haven't seen each other
since I married Mr. DeLorca.

57:07.426 --> 57:09.724
You obviously were twins.

57:10.262 --> 57:12.059
Yes, sergeant.

57:12.864 --> 57:17.426
Your sister left a note addressed to Maggie.
That would be you, wouldn't it?

57:17.602 --> 57:19.126
Yes.

57:25.010 --> 57:26.637
Would you mind?

57:26.812 --> 57:30.407
I mean, if it's not personal.

57:30.716 --> 57:32.650
No, of course not.

57:46.198 --> 57:48.530
"Not worth the effort anymore"?

57:49.000 --> 57:50.968
Why would she say that, Mrs. DeLorca?

57:51.636 --> 57:53.536
I don't know.

57:53.705 --> 57:57.141
She asked me to come and see her
last night, and I went.

57:57.509 --> 58:02.879
She told me she had financial problems.
But when I offered to help her, she refused.

58:03.048 --> 58:05.915
But why did Edie go
to your husband's funeral?

58:06.985 --> 58:09.180
She loved him once, very much.

58:09.354 --> 58:12.949
A long time ago, about 20 years ago.

58:13.125 --> 58:16.390
You think his death upset her so much
she committed suicide?

58:16.828 --> 58:18.659
I don't know.

58:19.197 --> 58:22.189
Well, who ever really does
in these cases?

58:22.367 --> 58:24.665
I guess we can mark this closed.

58:24.836 --> 58:27.805
- You told Mrs. DeLorca about the morgue?
- Oh, yes, I did.

58:28.373 --> 58:30.933
Just a formality. Thank you very much.

58:31.109 --> 58:33.771
I'll take Mrs. DeLorca to the coroner.

59:36.474 --> 59:39.671
Mrs. DeLorca, is this your sister,
Edith Phillips?

59:39.845 --> 59:41.244
Yes.

59:45.450 --> 59:47.645
Let me get you a cup of coffee.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.318
Thank you.

01:00:38.136 --> 01:00:40.036
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:00:42.274 --> 01:00:44.435
Well, you look so much like Edie.

01:00:46.478 --> 01:00:47.911
Well, we were twins.

01:01:00.892 --> 01:01:02.587
Yesterday...

01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:08.327
only last night, there she was,
talking about what we'd do on my day off.

01:01:08.733 --> 01:01:13.136
All upset because I had extra duty,
and I couldn't take her out like she felt like.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.438
She must've wanted to get out
real bad last night.

01:01:18.977 --> 01:01:20.638
Get away from the place.

01:01:20.912 --> 01:01:22.504
Last night...

01:01:24.282 --> 01:01:26.910
For the first time, last night...

01:01:27.085 --> 01:01:29.417
I had a feeling
she really hated that bar.

01:01:29.587 --> 01:01:32.988
Anywhere, she said. Anywhere,
movies, anywhere, just to get out!

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:43.595
I was there when she took in her first buck.
We framed it, hung it behind the bar.

01:01:43.835 --> 01:01:46.326
Oh, I can remember it like yesterday.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.638
You keep thinking and thinking,
every possible angle.

01:01:53.011 --> 01:01:55.980
What you might have done
that would've made a difference.

01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:01.585
- You loved her?
- I wanted to marry her.

01:02:02.988 --> 01:02:04.888
Did you tell her?

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:11.026
Well, I believe she knew. It...

01:02:11.696 --> 01:02:14.529
Well, she must've known.
It was sort of understood.

01:02:16.334 --> 01:02:18.165
Maybe she did, sergeant.

01:02:18.336 --> 01:02:22.864
Well, I'm pretty sure she would have agreed
once I got my retirement and settled down.

01:02:29.047 --> 01:02:30.878
Why did she do it?

01:02:32.283 --> 01:02:35.150
It just wasn't like Edie,
three months' rent.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.653
Now, how could she do a thing
like that for three months' rent?!

01:02:41.292 --> 01:02:42.725
Excuse me.

01:02:42.894 --> 01:02:45.556
The personal property, Mrs. DeLorca.

01:02:49.734 --> 01:02:51.292
Thank you.

01:02:59.778 --> 01:03:03.043
- Maybe you'd like these, sergeant.
- God, no.

01:03:03.548 --> 01:03:05.209
Excuse me, I...

01:03:05.383 --> 01:03:06.748
I'm... No.

01:03:08.686 --> 01:03:10.517
You're right.

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:14.254
It's better to forget her.

01:03:16.161 --> 01:03:17.958
She's dead.

01:03:30.608 --> 01:03:32.098
Madam.

01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:35.269
Mrs. Marshall called twice
while you were out.

01:03:35.914 --> 01:03:37.779
Thank you, Henry.

01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:43.582
- Have you had luncheon, madam?
- No, I'll just have a drink in my room.

01:03:44.022 --> 01:03:45.387
The usual?

01:03:49.127 --> 01:03:52.290
- The usual.
- Yes, madam.

01:04:14.853 --> 01:04:18.550
- Where did those come from?
- They were just delivered.

01:04:18.723 --> 01:04:23.023
Madam, you remember. You ordered them
just before Mr. DeLorca passed away.

01:04:24.596 --> 01:04:26.325
Oh, yes, I forgot.

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:41.478
Janet, I need some ashtrays.

01:04:41.646 --> 01:04:43.614
I'll tell Henry.

01:04:48.686 --> 01:04:50.654
Oh, thank you.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:55.485
- Does madam want these put away?
- Yes, please.

01:05:17.048 --> 01:05:20.381
- Madam did say to put these away.
- Yes.

01:05:21.452 --> 01:05:25.081
- Now, what do you want?
- The jewelry box, madam.

01:05:52.784 --> 01:05:56.379
These were my sister's.
She committed suicide last night.

01:05:56.554 --> 01:05:58.215
I'm so sorry.

01:05:58.389 --> 01:06:02.052
That's why the police came this morning.
Would you like them, Janet?

01:06:02.227 --> 01:06:04.127
Oh, no, madam. Thank you very much.

01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:09.027
- Your drink, madam.
- Come in, Henry.

01:06:12.837 --> 01:06:14.600
Thank you, Henry.

01:06:25.183 --> 01:06:26.741
Janet?

01:06:28.753 --> 01:06:30.880
- Leave me alone for a while.
- Yes, madam.

01:06:31.055 --> 01:06:33.023
Put all that away later.

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:48.550
Yes?

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.953
Who?

01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:55.325
Well, I'll be down in a little while.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.399
I'm taking a bath.

01:09:03.374 --> 01:09:07.310
Dona Anna,
do forgive me for keeping you waiting.

01:09:12.216 --> 01:09:15.652
I hear a new trial
has been put upon you.

01:09:15.853 --> 01:09:18.515
I had no idea you had a sister.

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:21.089
How very distressing.

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:23.452
Tell me about it, Margaret.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:28.395
Well, there's really nothing to tell.
I don't know why she did it.

01:09:28.966 --> 01:09:33.733
Are you sure she really
took her own life, my dear?

01:09:35.673 --> 01:09:39.404
- Couldn't it have been an accident?
- Oh, no. It wasn't an accident.

01:09:40.044 --> 01:09:45.845
One is so tempted to grasp at any straw
when the immortal soul is in the balance.

01:09:46.017 --> 01:09:50.453
Thank God our dear Francesco
was granted the mercy of a happy death.

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.818
Was he prepared, do you think?

01:09:55.026 --> 01:09:59.929
With a heart condition, I suppose
he must've known that sooner or later...

01:10:00.097 --> 01:10:04.295
And yet he took up
that ridiculous sport, golf.

01:10:04.469 --> 01:10:08.405
Do you remember when my cousin,
the tennis player...?

01:10:08.573 --> 01:10:10.268
Oh, what was his name?

01:10:11.876 --> 01:10:15.835
- Help me, help me.
- How stupid of me, Dona Anna.

01:10:16.948 --> 01:10:21.647
- I'm sure you would like some tea.
- No, thank you. Later, perhaps.

01:10:21.819 --> 01:10:26.188
Hi, Henry. Maggie, darling. Forgive us
for not coming to the cemetery yesterday...

01:10:26.357 --> 01:10:28.689
but Tom has a phobia about cemeteries.

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:32.193
Besides, we had to go to this party
in Pasadena, at the Taylors.

01:10:32.363 --> 01:10:33.990
Darling, it was absolutely mad.

01:10:34.165 --> 01:10:37.293
You wouldn't believe
some of the things that went on.

01:10:38.536 --> 01:10:40.663
You must be Dona Anna.
I'm Didi Marshall.

01:10:40.838 --> 01:10:43.102
- How do you do?
- What happened this morning?

01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:46.505
I thought we had a date.
I called you at least a dozen times.

01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:49.077
I had to see you
before I leave for Jamaica.

01:10:49.247 --> 01:10:50.771
Where were you?

01:10:51.382 --> 01:10:54.078
- At the morgue.
- The morgue?

01:10:54.252 --> 01:10:56.720
What do you mean, morgue? What for?

01:10:56.888 --> 01:11:00.153
Well, my sister committed suicide
last night.

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:02.525
Your sister? What sister?

01:11:02.693 --> 01:11:06.424
Oh, Maggie, what a hell of a thing
to happen right on top of Frank.

01:11:06.597 --> 01:11:10.033
How did it happen?
No. No, no. Don't tell me.

01:11:10.234 --> 01:11:13.499
I don't want to be haunted
all the time I'm away.

01:11:14.272 --> 01:11:18.800
Well, I guess I better shove off.
I still have loads of packing to do.

01:11:18.976 --> 01:11:22.742
You know, this mourning bit doesn't
suit you. Shed it before I get back.

01:11:22.914 --> 01:11:25.849
Bye-bye. I'll write you
as soon as I get there, darling.

01:11:26.017 --> 01:11:28.747
And I'll phone you
the minute I get back.

01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:32.081
Don't be too, too lonesome, sweetie.

01:11:32.557 --> 01:11:34.081
Oh, never mind, Henry.

01:11:34.258 --> 01:11:37.193
I think I'm still young enough
to open a door myself.

01:11:38.095 --> 01:11:42.088
Well, adios, darling,
or whatever they say down there.

01:11:52.577 --> 01:11:55.478
A thoroughly objectionable person.

01:11:56.347 --> 01:12:01.307
We were talking about Cousin Ricardo.
That was the name we couldn't remember.

01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:05.812
Now, my dear...

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:19.094
I think we should pray for Frank
and your unhappy sister.

01:12:26.243 --> 01:12:31.806
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

01:13:01.045 --> 01:13:03.172
- Yes?
- Hello, Margaret.

01:13:03.347 --> 01:13:05.679
This is Paul Harrison.
Did I disturb you?

01:13:07.918 --> 01:13:12.287
- I was asleep.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, but it's only 8:30.

01:13:12.456 --> 01:13:14.754
But sleep is the best medicine.

01:13:14.925 --> 01:13:19.021
Margaret, I haven't bothered you till now,
but there are quite a few papers...

01:13:19.196 --> 01:13:23.223
connected with the estate that need your
signature. May I bring them over?

01:13:24.135 --> 01:13:27.229
- Well, when?
- Tomorrow morning about 11.

01:13:28.372 --> 01:13:30.135
Well, that will be all right.

01:13:30.307 --> 01:13:32.002
Good night, Paul.

01:17:36.053 --> 01:17:39.284
Too bad I called
and woke you last night.

01:17:39.456 --> 01:17:41.321
This might not have happened.

01:17:42.059 --> 01:17:44.755
It wouldn't have mattered
when you called.

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:53.235
It's gotten so I'm afraid to turn around
for fear of what will happen next.

01:17:53.404 --> 01:17:56.737
Oh, just one of those rough patches,
Margaret.

01:17:56.907 --> 01:17:59.239
Things will look better in a few months.

01:18:12.256 --> 01:18:14.952
As you see, I've started smoking again.

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.027
- Thank you.
- The court is allowing you $3000 a month...

01:18:20.197 --> 01:18:21.994
until the probate is completed.

01:18:22.166 --> 01:18:26.535
By the way, Frank bequeathed $50,000
to your sister Edith.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:34.042
- 50,000 to Edith?
- It was in one of the codicils.

01:18:34.211 --> 01:18:37.339
This bequest, of course,
reverts to the estate now.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.587
Did the doctor say how soon your hand
will be in shape?

01:18:45.756 --> 01:18:49.248
He said it'd be at least two months
before I could play golf again.

01:18:49.426 --> 01:18:52.224
I imagine you wouldn't play in any case
for some time.

01:18:52.396 --> 01:18:55.229
However, I was thinking
of your signatures.

01:18:55.866 --> 01:18:58.164
My hen tracks.

01:18:58.335 --> 01:19:01.600
Not going to be a problem to you?
Legally, I mean.

01:19:01.772 --> 01:19:03.933
Not at all. I witnessed it.

01:19:04.108 --> 01:19:08.670
But you should register your new signature
with the bank, then there'll be no problem.

01:19:09.279 --> 01:19:12.214
Nothing to worry about, Margaret.
Nothing at all.

01:19:12.483 --> 01:19:14.007
Goodbye.

01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:45.542
Forgive me, madam.

01:19:45.883 --> 01:19:48.750
- What is it, Henry?
- Sergeant Hopson.

01:19:48.919 --> 01:19:51.387
I showed him into the reception.

01:19:54.324 --> 01:19:56.724
What did he want to see me about?

01:19:56.894 --> 01:19:59.158
He said it's personal.

01:20:01.065 --> 01:20:02.794
Excuse me.

01:20:02.966 --> 01:20:05.730
Henry, bring in the tea.

01:20:05.969 --> 01:20:07.869
What time is it?

01:20:08.505 --> 01:20:11.303
Backward, turn backward
O time, in your flight

01:20:11.475 --> 01:20:13.670
5:23 p.m.

01:20:18.148 --> 01:20:20.981
Henry said you wanted to see me,
Sergeant Hopson.

01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:22.709
Yes, I did.

01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:24.513
Good afternoon.

01:20:25.522 --> 01:20:28.650
- Say, what happened to your hand?
- A burn, nothing serious.

01:20:28.826 --> 01:20:32.125
I just wanted to tell you
that they closed Edie's bar Saturday.

01:20:32.296 --> 01:20:36.230
- What has that to do with me?
- Well, the barkeep, Dan, gave me this...

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.234
saying that it was Edie's.

01:20:44.775 --> 01:20:46.640
It was the first buck Edie took in.

01:20:48.612 --> 01:20:50.842
I just thought maybe
you'd like to have it.

01:20:53.016 --> 01:20:55.246
A very nice thought, sergeant...

01:20:55.652 --> 01:20:57.244
but I'd rather you kept it.

01:20:58.789 --> 01:21:00.313
Thank you.

01:21:02.092 --> 01:21:05.823
Mrs. DeLorca, there is one more thing.

01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:09.458
About the grave, Edie's grave.
I was out there Sunday.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.501
- There's no stone.
- That is no concern of yours, sergeant.

01:21:13.837 --> 01:21:17.000
I beg your pardon, Mrs. DeLorca.
I loved Edie.

01:21:18.942 --> 01:21:21.934
And if it's all right with you,
I'd like to buy a stone.

01:21:22.746 --> 01:21:24.941
My sister was fortunate to be so loved.

01:21:27.184 --> 01:21:30.017
I'll attend to it at the proper time.

01:21:30.754 --> 01:21:32.085
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:48.695
- Maggie!
- Didi.

01:21:48.872 --> 01:21:53.104
- Mrs. Marshall, we shall lose the fitting.
- I'll only be a minute. Maggie.

01:21:54.111 --> 01:21:56.909
I've been home for two weeks,
and every time I call...

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.072
I get the "madam isn't here" routine.
What gives?

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:03.742
- Shall we send them?
- No, I'll take them with me. Thank you.

01:22:03.921 --> 01:22:06.890
Honestly, darling, I think they've
got you on the ropes.

01:22:07.057 --> 01:22:08.888
You've even started smoking again.

01:22:09.059 --> 01:22:12.358
- Never underestimate the DeLorca crowd.
- Mrs. Marshall, please.

01:22:12.529 --> 01:22:15.555
Just a minute. She terrifies me.

01:22:15.732 --> 01:22:19.691
Tom and I are giving a "home again" party
Wednesday. You've got to come.

01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:22.464
- oh, Didi, I...
- There won't be a DeLorca in sight.

01:22:22.639 --> 01:22:27.508
We'll expect you.
Oh, cocktails at 7, dinner at 8.

01:23:01.878 --> 01:23:04.142
- Hello, Maggie.
- Hello.

01:23:04.615 --> 01:23:08.312
- Maggie! I'm glad Didi got you to come.
- Oh, hello, Tom.

01:23:08.485 --> 01:23:11.886
Very happy to see you.
Scotch on the rocks for Mrs. DeLorca!

01:23:12.055 --> 01:23:13.682
- You look great.
- Thank you.

01:23:13.857 --> 01:23:15.347
You're a naughty girl.

01:23:15.525 --> 01:23:18.460
I've phoned so many times,
and you've never called back.

01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:22.292
I've got great news. Didi's Billy Boy
won at Hollywood Park yesterday.

01:23:22.466 --> 01:23:24.866
- oh, how wonderful. Thank you.
- Yes, isn't it?

01:23:25.035 --> 01:23:27.196
- Congratulations.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:28.963
Cheers to Billy Boy.

01:23:29.139 --> 01:23:32.768
Darling! I've been on pins and needles
waiting for you to get here.

01:23:32.943 --> 01:23:34.911
You look absolutely divine.

01:23:35.078 --> 01:23:38.377
You'll have to excuse us,
but I insist that she mix and mingle.

01:23:38.548 --> 01:23:41.574
- She's got a lot of catching up to do.
- Sit with us at dinner?

01:23:41.752 --> 01:23:43.447
- Love to, if Didi permits.
- Good.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.748
I've got so much to tell you
about Montego. Tom's so cute.

01:23:46.923 --> 01:23:50.359
Played gin all the time,
and guess what I did all the time.

01:23:50.827 --> 01:23:52.385
Hi, Maggie, beautiful.

01:23:52.562 --> 01:23:56.623
You remember Florence,
my date at the gala in Cannes last year.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.394
- of course I remember.
- How nice to see you again.

01:23:59.569 --> 01:24:02.060
- Come along. See you later.
- You look wonderful.

01:24:02.239 --> 01:24:05.299
- Thank you.
- I've got a surprise for you, sweetie.

01:24:05.475 --> 01:24:07.102
Tony.

01:24:35.872 --> 01:24:37.703
Let me look at you.

01:24:39.042 --> 01:24:41.237
It's been a long time, Maggie.

01:24:47.084 --> 01:24:48.915
Must've been rough.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.581
Did you get my orchid?

01:24:52.589 --> 01:24:54.318
Yes.

01:25:00.764 --> 01:25:03.562
Oh, what a time you must have had.

01:25:05.001 --> 01:25:07.993
It felt awful leaving you
to face it alone.

01:25:08.772 --> 01:25:10.672
Three months.

01:25:14.911 --> 01:25:18.438
I called the house when I got in.
Got a royal brush from Henry.

01:25:18.615 --> 01:25:21.709
Well, I haven't been taking any calls.

01:25:21.885 --> 01:25:25.753
You've no idea what it's like
to be in mourning if you're a DeLorca.

01:25:25.922 --> 01:25:27.514
To hell with it.

01:25:27.691 --> 01:25:30.091
I forgot how to spell the name.

01:25:37.267 --> 01:25:40.862
- Let's go.
- Why, I can't. I've just arrived.

01:25:41.905 --> 01:25:43.873
All right. We leave in an hour.

01:25:44.574 --> 01:25:47.270
Well, not tonight, Tony.

01:25:47.444 --> 01:25:51.278
Harrison's coming over
to go over some legal papers.

01:25:51.448 --> 01:25:54.383
- Nice timing.
- Well, I didn't know you were coming home.

01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:57.884
- I must get back to the party.
- Maggie...

01:26:00.991 --> 01:26:02.253
Are we in good shape?

01:26:03.894 --> 01:26:05.293
In very good shape.

01:26:06.363 --> 01:26:09.298
- What time tomorrow?
- Well, phone me in the morning.

01:26:09.466 --> 01:26:12.663
- I'll have Henry put you through.
- Maggie...

01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:17.039
From now on, it's you and me.

01:26:18.842 --> 01:26:20.469
Of course.

01:26:50.273 --> 01:26:52.434
- Mr. Collins.
- Hello, Henry. How's tricks?

01:26:52.609 --> 01:26:54.338
- Are you expected?
- Very expected.

01:26:54.511 --> 01:26:56.877
- Tell her I'm here.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:08.116
Shall I pack a raincoat?

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:11.488
Yes. Janet, call Mr. Harrison's office,
see if he's back yet.

01:27:11.661 --> 01:27:13.492
Yes, madam.

01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:28.137
Yes?

01:27:30.881 --> 01:27:34.009
Tell Mr. Collins he'll have to wait.
I'm not dressed yet.

01:27:34.284 --> 01:27:37.879
Mr. Harrison, please. For Mrs. DeLorca.

01:27:41.191 --> 01:27:44.251
- He's still out of town, madam.
- I'll take it.

01:27:45.462 --> 01:27:47.054
Thank you.

01:27:47.464 --> 01:27:49.455
This is Margaret DeLorca.

01:27:50.567 --> 01:27:54.333
Mr. Harrison's housekeeper told me
he was expected back today.

01:27:55.005 --> 01:27:59.704
Well, do you know where I can reach him?
I must talk to him before I go to Europe.

01:28:00.944 --> 01:28:03.242
Well, give me his partner, then.

01:28:05.649 --> 01:28:09.551
Well, if either of them get back,
have them call me immediately.

01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:11.016
Thank you very much.

01:28:13.723 --> 01:28:18.558
Mr. Collins. Madam isn't quite ready.
She will be down as soon as possible.

01:28:18.929 --> 01:28:21.762
Well, tell her I'll be down
at the practice green.

01:28:22.465 --> 01:28:25.628
- oh, are the clubs in the usual place?
- Yes, sir.

01:28:34.344 --> 01:28:36.312
Sorry I was so long.

01:28:36.613 --> 01:28:38.240
That's all right.

01:28:38.415 --> 01:28:41.509
If I could only do that in a match
when I need it.

01:28:41.918 --> 01:28:43.783
How's my girl?

01:28:46.756 --> 01:28:48.587
Come and sit down.

01:28:53.029 --> 01:28:55.896
Knowing your passion for kilts...

01:28:56.199 --> 01:28:58.531
I got you a present in Scotland.

01:29:01.805 --> 01:29:03.670
I can't believe it, Maggie.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.502
- You, smoking?
- I used to smoke years ago.

01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:08.837
Did you?

01:29:09.346 --> 01:29:11.143
Come on, open it.

01:29:13.783 --> 01:29:17.344
I found it in a little inn
on the way up to St. Andrews.

01:29:18.054 --> 01:29:20.079
Oh, that inn.

01:29:20.256 --> 01:29:22.850
We'll have to go there,
you and me, baby.

01:29:28.798 --> 01:29:30.561
They say that heather's good luck.

01:29:31.534 --> 01:29:35.197
Look, I had your name
engraved on the back, see?

01:29:38.141 --> 01:29:42.635
- How'd you manage that?
- Oh, nothing serious. Just a burn.

01:29:42.912 --> 01:29:44.470
Poor baby.

01:29:48.284 --> 01:29:49.979
Duke!

01:29:51.855 --> 01:29:53.413
Duke?

01:29:54.658 --> 01:29:56.683
Go on, go on. That's a boy, go on.

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:04.157
When did you two fall in love?

01:30:04.334 --> 01:30:08.896
Since Frank died,
he's been lonely and friendly.

01:30:09.205 --> 01:30:11.002
Competition?

01:30:13.443 --> 01:30:16.207
- Tony, the servants!
- Who cares?

01:30:16.379 --> 01:30:19.177
The only thing I care about
right now is you...

01:30:19.349 --> 01:30:21.783
and a Maserati, in that order.

01:30:22.252 --> 01:30:25.187
- Immediate delivery.
- Tony.

01:30:28.658 --> 01:30:29.920
I'm going to Europe.

01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:33.886
- Great. When do we leave?
- I'm going alone.

01:30:35.198 --> 01:30:38.190
You gotta be kidding.
You can't go without me.

01:30:39.703 --> 01:30:42.228
Sergeant Hopson to see you, madam.

01:30:42.706 --> 01:30:45.140
Will you see him out there?

01:30:45.842 --> 01:30:47.104
Sergeant Hopson?

01:30:49.879 --> 01:30:53.713
- Yes, Henry. Send him out here.
- Very well, madam.

01:31:04.828 --> 01:31:06.455
Who is Sergeant Hopson?

01:31:07.263 --> 01:31:08.958
A friend of my sister's.

01:31:10.233 --> 01:31:12.531
Maggie, what's eating you?

01:31:12.836 --> 01:31:14.701
You're not yourself.

01:31:16.306 --> 01:31:18.433
Something wrong?
Something I should know?

01:31:18.608 --> 01:31:21.133
Oh, no, there's nothing wrong.

01:31:28.084 --> 01:31:30.211
You're not trying to unload me, are you?

01:31:30.386 --> 01:31:33.378
Oh, Tony, now, don't be ridiculous.

01:31:33.556 --> 01:31:35.251
Well, I hope I'm not butting in,
Mrs. DeLorca.

01:31:37.927 --> 01:31:40.191
Sergeant Hopson, Mr. Collins.

01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:41.829
Hello.

01:31:41.998 --> 01:31:45.456
- What did you want to see me about?
- Well, I saw the stone...

01:31:46.436 --> 01:31:48.734
and it looks very nice. Real nice, now.

01:31:49.739 --> 01:31:52.731
Will somebody clue me in?
What stone is this?

01:31:53.176 --> 01:31:55.110
The headstone on my sister's grave.

01:31:55.979 --> 01:31:57.537
When did she die?

01:31:57.714 --> 01:32:01.206
The day of the funeral.
That is, Mr. DeLorca's funeral.

01:32:01.885 --> 01:32:04.115
That must have been rough on you,
Maggie.

01:32:04.821 --> 01:32:07.312
- What did she die of?
- She committed suicide.

01:32:17.901 --> 01:32:22.167
Well, I'll be getting along.
I just wanted to say thank you and that...

01:32:23.039 --> 01:32:25.940
I'm sorry I spoke out of turn
the other day.

01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:27.872
Quite all right, sergeant.

01:32:31.047 --> 01:32:33.015
Mrs. DeLorca?

01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:38.382
Something's been on my mind.
The night you were down there with Edie...

01:32:38.555 --> 01:32:40.352
did she say anything about me?

01:32:42.392 --> 01:32:43.689
What night was that?

01:32:44.627 --> 01:32:47.095
The night she committed suicide.

01:32:49.232 --> 01:32:51.393
She said nothing about marrying me?

01:32:52.168 --> 01:32:53.829
No, sergeant.

01:32:54.003 --> 01:32:56.665
Well, maybe if I'd just
laid it on the line.

01:32:58.141 --> 01:33:01.269
Look, I'm sorry if I've disturbed you.

01:33:01.845 --> 01:33:03.540
Sorry.

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:13.152
Would you have some lemonade, Tony?

01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:16.181
What was your sister's name?

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.557
Edith.

01:33:20.797 --> 01:33:23.561
Was that the twin sister
who lived in San Francisco?

01:33:23.733 --> 01:33:26.133
Yes. She moved to Los Angeles
a few years ago.

01:33:26.302 --> 01:33:29.271
Oh, Tony, I'd like
to forget all about it.

01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:33.067
I'll make you forget.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.507
Tony.

01:33:39.015 --> 01:33:41.006
You don't want me to make love to you.

01:33:41.184 --> 01:33:45.086
I don't understand, after all the fun we had.
Honolulu, Nassau, Miami.

01:33:45.255 --> 01:33:47.086
It was fun, wasn't it?

01:33:47.323 --> 01:33:49.314
Well, of course.

01:33:51.961 --> 01:33:56.261
You're not Margaret, you're Edith! Maggie
and I never went to any of those places.

01:33:56.432 --> 01:33:58.229
Never! You killed her.

01:33:58.401 --> 01:34:02.235
The smoking, the dog. You killed her!

01:34:04.707 --> 01:34:06.766
- Get your hands off.
- Just take it easy.

01:34:06.943 --> 01:34:08.501
Get them off!

01:34:16.686 --> 01:34:20.713
- Do you want to file a complaint?
- Oh, no, sergeant. Please go.

01:34:24.627 --> 01:34:26.492
Whatever you say.

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:54.256
We got a few things to talk over,
Mrs. DeLorca.

01:34:55.458 --> 01:34:58.450
I'm gonna take you
for everything you've got.

01:34:59.429 --> 01:35:04.389
For openers, the Maserati convertible,
14 grand plus tax and license.

01:35:04.667 --> 01:35:09.001
The estate will be in probate for a year.
I only have my living expenses.

01:35:09.172 --> 01:35:11.868
Oh, you overlooked
the DeLorca rock pile.

01:35:12.308 --> 01:35:13.741
The diamonds, the emeralds.

01:35:14.077 --> 01:35:17.410
And those pearls that looked so beautiful
when Maggie wore them.

01:35:18.014 --> 01:35:19.447
Let's start with that ring.

01:35:24.554 --> 01:35:26.454
The bracelet.

01:35:27.523 --> 01:35:29.855
Call it "pay as you go."

01:35:31.527 --> 01:35:33.256
Come on, baby.

01:35:33.963 --> 01:35:36.022
It's safecracking time.

01:35:46.843 --> 01:35:49.812
Lieutenant Hankow
in the Robbery division, please.

01:35:55.318 --> 01:35:59.015
Hi, lieutenant, this is Eddie Crouse,
Brentown Loan.

01:35:59.422 --> 01:36:03.756
Fine, how are you? There was a man here
just now said his name was Tony Collins...

01:36:03.926 --> 01:36:07.453
with two pieces of very large jewelry
and no bill of sale.

01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:10.565
Said he wanted to get rid of it fast
to buy a Maserati.

01:36:12.101 --> 01:36:13.625
A what?

01:36:13.803 --> 01:36:15.498
Oh, one of those.

01:36:15.671 --> 01:36:18.435
Yeah, maybe we better.
Give me that name again.

01:36:18.775 --> 01:36:20.470
Tony...

01:36:21.144 --> 01:36:22.839
Collins.

01:36:23.146 --> 01:36:24.704
Address?

01:36:24.881 --> 01:36:27.247
Yeah. Yeah.

01:36:28.951 --> 01:36:30.316
- Got it.
- Hey, Sid.

01:36:30.486 --> 01:36:32.784
All right, thank you, Mr. Crouse.

01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:34.884
Sid, what's that about Tony Collins?

01:36:35.058 --> 01:36:37.822
Trying to hock some jewelry
with the Brentown outfit.

01:36:37.994 --> 01:36:40.485
Crouse turned him down.
Figured it might be hot.

01:36:40.663 --> 01:36:43.962
- Do you know anything about him?
- Yeah. I saw him this morning.

01:36:44.133 --> 01:36:47.398
- Let me follow this through, will you?
- You got it.

01:36:48.538 --> 01:36:51.200
Skorovich, toss me my hat, will you?

01:37:15.264 --> 01:37:19.928
- What do these apartments rent for?
- From 4 to 700 dollars a month.

01:37:20.103 --> 01:37:22.128
Unfurnished, of course.

01:37:24.107 --> 01:37:27.941
- How much does Collins pay?
- $500 a month.

01:37:28.311 --> 01:37:30.336
Plus service charges.

01:37:36.986 --> 01:37:39.853
- What does Collins do for a living?
- He's a golf pro...

01:37:40.022 --> 01:37:42.149
at the Las Floras Country Club.

01:37:42.325 --> 01:37:44.520
Must sell a lot of clubs.

01:37:45.528 --> 01:37:48.497
We just want to look around.
We won't disturb anything.

01:37:48.664 --> 01:37:50.655
Oh, fine, fine.

01:37:51.033 --> 01:37:55.697
But I would appreciate if you wouldn't allow
Mr. Collins to find you in his apartment.

01:37:55.872 --> 01:37:57.635
Won't be long.

01:37:59.942 --> 01:38:01.876
I'll take the bedroom.

01:38:57.433 --> 01:38:59.025
Ben.

01:39:01.671 --> 01:39:03.434
Take a look.

01:39:05.775 --> 01:39:08.107
Golf pro in the jewelry business.

01:39:08.277 --> 01:39:10.677
- What did you find?
- You tell me.

01:39:10.846 --> 01:39:13.041
I found it in his clothes closet.

01:39:15.117 --> 01:39:16.846
Narcotics?

01:39:17.887 --> 01:39:19.445
I don't know.

01:39:19.622 --> 01:39:21.453
Something for the lab.

01:39:22.858 --> 01:39:25.486
- Check the bathroom?
- Yeah. Nothing.

01:39:28.431 --> 01:39:30.331
Put it back where you found it.

01:39:36.572 --> 01:39:38.062
Okay.

01:39:38.241 --> 01:39:42.371
Collins is on his way up. Here. Take this
to the lab and tell them to rush it.

01:39:42.545 --> 01:39:44.672
- All right.
- I'll stick around.

01:40:27.523 --> 01:40:29.252
Couldn't unload it?

01:40:33.696 --> 01:40:36.722
- What the hell are you doing here?
- The manager let me in.

01:40:36.899 --> 01:40:39.993
- Then he's in a lot of trouble.
- Could be.

01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:43.768
How did you come by that stuff
you're trying to pawn?

01:40:43.939 --> 01:40:46.305
Oh, that creep at the loan company.

01:40:46.475 --> 01:40:48.409
How did you get it?

01:40:50.513 --> 01:40:52.981
A lady gave it to me.

01:40:53.783 --> 01:40:56.479
- Services rendered.
- What lady?

01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:02.585
- Mrs. Frank DeLorca. Want to ask her?
- Well, that's what I had in mind.

01:41:02.758 --> 01:41:05.522
How about the stuff you have stashed
in the golf bag?

01:41:05.695 --> 01:41:08.255
May as well ask her about that too.

01:41:09.131 --> 01:41:11.429
Whatever you say, sergeant.

01:41:24.513 --> 01:41:27.676
He doesn't believe that
you gave me the jewelry.

01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:30.546
Will you straighten him out, baby?

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.154
Mr. Collins told you
the truth, sergeant.

01:41:33.456 --> 01:41:37.085
- If you say so, Mrs. DeLorca.
- And, sergeant...

01:41:38.761 --> 01:41:41.992
get off my back. You had no right
to search my apartment...

01:41:42.164 --> 01:41:46.328
even if the manager let you in.
So get it off the books, now.

01:41:46.769 --> 01:41:49.431
Unless you want to face charges.

01:42:01.617 --> 01:42:03.608
Robbery detail.

01:42:05.521 --> 01:42:07.614
Let me talk to Ben Hogue.

01:42:08.891 --> 01:42:11.758
Ben, the jewelry thing
on Tony Collins...

01:42:12.995 --> 01:42:14.963
off the books.

01:42:15.698 --> 01:42:18.633
They were a gift from Mrs. DeLorca.

01:42:19.468 --> 01:42:21.436
What did it say?

01:42:22.905 --> 01:42:24.736
Oh, is that so?

01:42:25.074 --> 01:42:26.871
Yes, of course.

01:42:27.877 --> 01:42:29.777
I'll ask him.

01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:36.140
What do you use
arsenic for, Mr. Collins?

01:42:36.552 --> 01:42:38.577
I drink it on the rocks.

01:42:38.754 --> 01:42:41.723
Oh, come on, sergeant.
Make sense for a change, will you?

01:42:41.891 --> 01:42:44.325
We found a sack full of arsenic
in your closet.

01:42:45.961 --> 01:42:48.293
Do you want to explain it
here or downtown?

01:42:48.464 --> 01:42:52.491
Well, now, do you want the 50-cent
explanation or the dollar tour?

01:42:52.668 --> 01:42:55.637
- Now, you cased my place, right?
- That is right.

01:42:55.805 --> 01:43:00.538
- Did you happen to notice a balcony?
- I did.

01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:03.610
And on this balcony,
did you see some flower boxes?

01:43:03.779 --> 01:43:05.508
Yes.

01:43:06.215 --> 01:43:12.211
Weed free. That's what arsenic
is used for, sergeant. Weeds.

01:43:12.488 --> 01:43:14.251
Next.

01:43:15.624 --> 01:43:17.819
Where did you get it?

01:43:17.993 --> 01:43:20.518
At my club. Las Floras Country Club.

01:43:20.696 --> 01:43:23.927
They buy it by the truckload.
I borrowed some.

01:43:27.002 --> 01:43:30.028
What did your husband die of,
Mrs. DeLorca?

01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:32.205
A heart attack.

01:43:33.142 --> 01:43:37.203
Arsenic poisoning is often mistaken
for a heart attack.

01:43:43.886 --> 01:43:45.786
Good night.

01:43:57.299 --> 01:44:01.326
Maggie was as guilty as I.
Now you're Maggie.

01:44:01.504 --> 01:44:04.029
The old Mexican standoff, isn't it?

01:44:07.276 --> 01:44:11.235
You said something this morning
about going to Europe alone.

01:44:11.413 --> 01:44:13.404
We're going together, Edith.

01:44:14.016 --> 01:44:17.349
You and Maggie killed Frank.

01:44:19.822 --> 01:44:21.813
Dear God!

01:44:22.291 --> 01:44:26.022
Any way you slice it, cancels us out.

01:44:26.195 --> 01:44:31.223
Take me no time at all to prove that you
aren't Maggie, and you killed your sister.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.837
Sort of being like in the same boat,
except I'm in the driver's seat.

01:44:36.005 --> 01:44:41.910
Oh, not by a long, long shot.
You see, Tony, I don't care anymore.

01:44:42.278 --> 01:44:45.179
I don't care one damn
about anything anymore.

01:44:45.347 --> 01:44:51.650
But you, you care. How you care,
about money, about cars, about living.

01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:55.620
You can't hurt me anymore,
not the police, nor you, or anyone else.

01:44:55.791 --> 01:44:58.225
Now, get out!

01:44:59.228 --> 01:45:01.458
Get out!

01:45:01.630 --> 01:45:05.259
Like hell, I'll get out.
You try to make me get out.

01:45:05.434 --> 01:45:07.959
- Duke!
- Or you do what I...

01:45:13.943 --> 01:45:15.934
Get him off!

01:45:35.064 --> 01:45:36.622
Henry!

01:45:39.268 --> 01:45:41.361
Henry!

01:45:41.537 --> 01:45:43.266
Henry!

01:45:43.439 --> 01:45:45.339
Henry!

01:45:52.881 --> 01:45:54.746
- You're back again?
- Yeah, I'm back.

01:45:54.917 --> 01:45:57.750
- Jim, I've got work to do.
- Only take a minute.

01:45:58.387 --> 01:46:00.252
Okay, what's on your mind today?

01:46:00.422 --> 01:46:02.754
The thing that happened
at the DeLorca place.

01:46:02.925 --> 01:46:06.190
Jim, we went over that yesterday.

01:46:06.362 --> 01:46:10.196
A golf pro gets killed by a dog.
It's all wrapped up in the files.

01:46:10.366 --> 01:46:12.129
Maybe.

01:46:12.301 --> 01:46:17.295
Maybe. Once you told me that maybe a lot
of rich old men who die of heart attacks...

01:46:17.473 --> 01:46:21.500
are lying in their graves with arsenic
in their stomachs? Remember?

01:46:22.077 --> 01:46:25.308
- What rich old men are you talking about?
- DeLorca.

01:46:25.481 --> 01:46:27.449
Pretty rich.

01:46:28.517 --> 01:46:33.420
Look, Jim, will you do me a favor?
Do yourself a favor. Forget the DeLorcas.

01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:36.524
She reminds you so much of Edie,
you can't see straight.

01:46:36.692 --> 01:46:39.286
I'm talking to you as a cop, Jim.
Snap out of it.

01:46:39.628 --> 01:46:41.596
I know. My detail is robbery.

01:46:41.764 --> 01:46:46.030
All I have to worry about is who gets
the jewelry that they found on Collins.

01:46:46.201 --> 01:46:49.227
But there's a lot of arsenic
floating around.

01:46:49.405 --> 01:46:53.136
Collins told the greenskeeper at the club
he wanted it for his lawn.

01:46:53.308 --> 01:46:55.606
On the 17th floor?

01:46:56.145 --> 01:46:58.579
He gets the arsenic
just before DeLorca dies...

01:46:58.747 --> 01:47:01.409
then goes to Europe
a day before the funeral.

01:47:01.583 --> 01:47:04.518
If you ask me,
that's pretty good timing.

01:47:06.388 --> 01:47:08.879
If I were sitting
where you're sitting...

01:47:09.058 --> 01:47:12.459
the coroner would be digging
up DeLorca's body right now.

01:47:38.987 --> 01:47:41.581
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sergeant.

01:47:41.757 --> 01:47:46.126
- I have to talk to you about the jewelry.
- I thought we'd been all through that.

01:47:46.595 --> 01:47:49.029
No, this is different.

01:47:50.232 --> 01:47:55.966
Please forgive me. Yesterday was
such an awful ordeal for me.

01:47:56.672 --> 01:48:00.972
The coroner's office is holding the jewelry
until ownership can be established...

01:48:01.143 --> 01:48:03.668
because it was found
on Mr. Collins' body.

01:48:03.846 --> 01:48:05.336
Oh, I see.

01:48:05.514 --> 01:48:07.846
That's an awful lot of jewelry,
Mrs. DeLorca.

01:48:08.016 --> 01:48:12.214
And all I have to find out is,
did you give it under duress?

01:48:12.721 --> 01:48:17.351
- Was he blackmailing you?
- Blackmailing me? What for?

01:48:18.393 --> 01:48:20.623
He was my lover.

01:48:24.833 --> 01:48:27.768
Well, then, it goes to his next of kin.

01:48:27.936 --> 01:48:30.837
Some fellow in Perth, Australia.

01:48:32.274 --> 01:48:36.608
- Well, he's going to get a pleasant surprise.
- Is there anything else, sergeant?

01:48:37.513 --> 01:48:40.573
No. No, that's all from my division.

01:48:41.316 --> 01:48:44.114
But Homicide came up
with some evidence this morning.

01:48:44.286 --> 01:48:46.982
They exhumed your husband's body.

01:48:47.156 --> 01:48:49.556
They found arsenic.

01:49:12.848 --> 01:49:14.543
Did you...?

01:49:15.117 --> 01:49:20.646
Did you ever wake up in the dark feeling...?
Feeling all alone?

01:49:20.823 --> 01:49:23.587
Oh, I mean, terribly alone.

01:49:23.759 --> 01:49:28.128
No one... No one else on earth,
just the...

01:49:28.297 --> 01:49:30.891
the dark all around you and that...

01:49:31.066 --> 01:49:34.900
that awful, scary emptiness?

01:49:36.305 --> 01:49:38.671
Don't you know me?

01:49:42.911 --> 01:49:45.744
Don't you know me, Jim?

01:49:45.914 --> 01:49:52.444
I'm not Margaret. I didn't kill
Frank DeLorca. I'm Edie, Jim.

01:49:53.322 --> 01:49:55.586
Mrs. DeLorca...

01:49:56.692 --> 01:49:59.559
I don't know where you think
this'll get you...

01:50:01.063 --> 01:50:05.261
but you couldn't be Edie
in a thousand years.

01:50:05.534 --> 01:50:09.664
Why, Edie was the kind of person a guy
is lucky to meet once in his lifetime.

01:50:10.405 --> 01:50:14.273
She was an honest to God good person.
Sweet, gentle, kind, and you...

01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:18.677
Lady, you don't know
the meaning of those words.

01:50:19.548 --> 01:50:22.073
Edie would never murder her sister.

01:50:22.251 --> 01:50:24.776
She wouldn't even hurt a fly.

01:50:32.127 --> 01:50:33.685
Forget it, sergeant.

01:50:34.963 --> 01:50:38.763
It was just a lousy joke.

01:50:39.601 --> 01:50:45.597
Edie and I used to try and fool people
all the time when we were kids.

01:50:56.718 --> 01:51:02.384
Jim. Mrs. DeLorca, I've got to book you.
The charge is suspicion of murder.

01:51:13.335 --> 01:51:15.235
I better change, don't you think?

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.067
Why don't you gentlemen
have a drink while I get ready?

01:51:22.244 --> 01:51:27.341
- I'm sorry, I'll have to go with you.
- No. No. It's all right.

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.255
Are they sure?

01:51:40.429 --> 01:51:43.159
Yes, they're sure. Beyond a doubt.

01:51:47.269 --> 01:51:50.705
Mr. Harrison called.
I told him you were busy.

01:51:50.872 --> 01:51:52.806
Thank you.

01:51:59.948 --> 01:52:03.748
At the trial, madam,
what would you have me say?

01:52:11.893 --> 01:52:14.521
You've known all along.

01:52:15.063 --> 01:52:16.325
Yes, madam.

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:21.360
And you're saying...

01:52:21.536 --> 01:52:23.470
you won't tell anybody.

01:52:23.638 --> 01:52:26.038
If that is your wish, madam.

01:52:29.211 --> 01:52:31.873
And I thought I was all alone.

01:52:34.549 --> 01:52:36.847
Thank you, Henry.

01:52:51.666 --> 01:52:55.397
- Silence in the court. Silence.
- She told me Collins was her lover.

01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:59.062
Mr. Collins didn't pay the rent,
Mrs. DeLorca did.

01:52:59.241 --> 01:53:04.235
A very cozy setup, ladies and gentlemen.
Look at her, an admitted adulteress.

01:53:04.413 --> 01:53:09.043
Margaret DeLorca is guilty of loving
the wrong man. Nothing else.

01:53:09.217 --> 01:53:12.050
She never waited
on Mr. DeLorca personally.

01:53:12.521 --> 01:53:14.489
Whiskey and milk.

01:53:14.656 --> 01:53:16.783
Madam gave it to him the night he died.

01:53:16.958 --> 01:53:19.893
Frank DeLorca had a history
of coronary disease...

01:53:20.062 --> 01:53:23.031
symptoms similar to those
of arsenic poisoning.

01:53:23.298 --> 01:53:25.562
He said he wanted it for his lawn.

01:53:25.734 --> 01:53:29.636
Heart failure induced
by a massive dose of arsenic.

01:53:29.805 --> 01:53:33.241
Guesses, opinions, but no proof.

01:53:33.408 --> 01:53:36.206
Facts, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

01:53:36.378 --> 01:53:41.315
Facts and proof beyond
any reasonable doubt.

01:53:43.752 --> 01:53:46.687
The defendant will please rise.

01:53:52.527 --> 01:53:55.928
Margaret DeLorca, do you
have anything to say...

01:53:56.098 --> 01:53:58.430
before sentence shall be
passed upon you?

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.329
No, Your Honor.

01:54:00.869 --> 01:54:05.306
It is the judgment and sentence of the court
that the defendant, Margaret DeLorca...

01:54:05.474 --> 01:54:08.705
found guilty of the crime of murder
in the first degree...

01:54:08.877 --> 01:54:13.075
shall suffer the extreme penalty,
to wit, the death penalty.

01:54:13.248 --> 01:54:16.217
That said penalty shall be
inflicted within the walls...

01:54:16.384 --> 01:54:19.444
of the state penitentiary
at San Quentin, California...

01:54:19.621 --> 01:54:23.057
in the manner and means
prescribed by law, to wit...

01:54:23.892 --> 01:54:28.829
