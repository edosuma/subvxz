GREAT!

12:24.368 --> 12:26.162

- OKAY!

12:26.245 --> 12:28.164
AMBER FIRST, THEN WE DEAL
WITH THE REST LATER.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.666

BEFORE DENBY LEAVES FOR WORK.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.882
[steam hissing]

12:47.975 --> 12:50.060

IF DENBY HAS FOUND AMBER,

12:50.144 --> 12:51.187
SHE'S HARDLY GONNA TELL US.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.272
- JUST LOOK AT HER FACE.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.192
WHEN PEOPLE LIE, THEY BLINK
OR RUB THEIR NOSES.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.526

12:57.610 --> 12:58.652
- SORRY YOU HAD TO WAIT.

OFF THE HEAT.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.947
- PORRIDGE, YOU SAY.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.991
- SORRY, IT'S JUST
WE'VE LOST AMBER,

13:04.074 --> 13:06.118
AND SOMEONE SAW HER COME
OVER HERE A MINUTE AGO.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.661
- REALLY?
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.914
- SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN AMBER?

13:09.997 --> 13:10.998
- I HAVEN'T.

13:12.958 --> 13:13.709
- AND YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THIS?

13:13.792 --> 13:15.044
- ALFIE, DO YOU NEED GLASSES?

13:15.127 --> 13:18.130
- I'M SURE SHE WENT
STRAIGHT OVER TO THE SCHOOL.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.340
WE'LL GO CATCH UP THERE.
- BYE.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.218
- OKAY--NO.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.895
- AMBER'S BUSINESS PROJECT?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.230
- YEAH, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A SURPRISE FOR HER DAD.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.773
- SHE'S NOT IN SCHOOL.
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.400
- GUYS, THIS HAS GOTTEN
OUT OF HAND.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.276
WE NEED TO TELL
SOMEONE ABOUT THIS.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.986
- AND SAY WHAT?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.447
"WE'RE SORRY WE BROKE
INTO MISS DENBY'S HOUSE?"

13:43.531 --> 13:45.074
- OKAY, LOOK, LET'S GET BACK
TO THE GATEHOUSE

13:45.157 --> 13:46.700
THIS LUNCHTIME
WHEN DENBY'S NOT HERE.

13:46.784 --> 13:51.121
IF WE STILL CAN'T FIND AMBER,
THEN WE TELL SOMEONE.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.414
- FABIAN.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.500
- UM, I'LL CATCH YOU UP.
- YEAH.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.044
- YEAH?

13:57.127 --> 14:01.006
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND JOY.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.092
WELL, APART FROM THAT
SHE ASKED YOU OUT

14:03.175 --> 14:06.554
AND YOU SMASHED HER HEART
INTO TINY, LITTLE PIECES.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.680
- WHAT? NO--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:07.763 --> 14:12.142
- FABIAN,
JOY IS DEVASTATED.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.771
WHEN SOMEONE GIVES YOU
THEIR HEART, FABIAN,

14:15.854 --> 14:19.525
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL
NOT TO DROP IT,

14:19.608 --> 14:23.529
WHETHER YOU ASKED
FOR IT OR NOT.

14:28.075 --> 14:33.163
- THE TIME IS ALMOST
UPON US, CORBIERRE.

14:36.166 --> 14:40.629
BUT WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS,
NO BRACELET,

14:40.713 --> 14:44.592
HOW WILL I CONDUCT
THE CEREMONY?

14:48.846 --> 14:50.931
THIS IS MY LIFE'S WORK.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.230
I SHALL NOT FAIL.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.333
- JOY, JOY, JOY, JOY,
I--I'M SO SORRY.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.335
I WAS, UH...
BUSY.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.795
- AVOIDING ME?

15:21.879 --> 15:25.299
I'M A BIG GIRL, FABES.
YOU DON'T NEED TO.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.926
AND HONESTLY,
I'M JUST REALLY BUSY THIS YEAR.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.723
I'M FINE.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.184
NAPKINS!

15:35.267 --> 15:37.144
WE DON'T HAVE ANY NAPKINS.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.063
I'LL JUST GO GET SOME.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.314
- NO--

15:43.192 --> 15:46.028
- WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT DENBY,

15:46.111 --> 15:48.072
AND WITH AMBER MISSING...

15:48.155 --> 15:50.032
THE MORE I FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS PLACE, THE MORE...

15:50.115 --> 15:52.576
I FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T
DO THIS ON OUR OWN.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.371
- I HEAR YOU, ALL RIGHT?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.956
IF I CAN PROVE MY DAD'S
INNOCENT, WE'LL TELL HIM, OKAY?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.249
HE CAN HELP US.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.501
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
SEARCH HIS OFFICE?

16:00.584 --> 16:03.170
- YOU GOT IT.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.423
- MISS DENBY?

16:06.507 --> 16:07.925
MISS DENBY!

16:08.008 --> 16:10.719
MAY I INTRODUCE AMBER'S FATHER,
MR. MILLINGTON?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.971
- GREAT TO FINALLY
MEET YOU IN PERSON.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.098
- IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.849
I STUDIED BUSINESS
AT COLLEGE,

16:15.933 --> 16:17.393
BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.103
- WELL, I ALWAYS SAY,
LEARNING SHOULD BE FUN.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.605
- THAT'S WHAT AMBER SAYS
ABOUT THIS PLACE:

16:21.689 --> 16:23.774
NEVER A DULL MOMENT.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.442
WHERE IS SHE, ANYWAY?

16:25.526 --> 16:26.819
- PATRICIA?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.737
NO SIGN OF AMBER YET?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.197
- UM...

16:30.989 --> 16:34.243
ACTUALLY, SHE'S SICK.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.995
- AMBER'S SICK?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.080
IS SHE OKAY?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.498
DID SHE ASK FOR ME?

16:39.581 --> 16:41.375
- WELL, TRUDY
HASN'T CALLED ME.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.502
- NO!
UH, SHE ASKED ME TO TELL YOU.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.753
- WELL, I HOPE IT'S
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.506
- HOW CAN I NOT BE WORRIED?

16:47.589 --> 16:50.300
[sighs dramatically]

16:50.384 --> 16:53.804
- I'LL GIVE HER A CALL,
LET HER KNOW I'M HERE.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.415
- A KEY!

17:25.169 --> 17:28.380
- WHEN'S LUNCHTIME
GOING TO HAPPEN?

17:28.464 --> 17:29.798
- AS LONG AS DENBY'S HERE,

17:29.882 --> 17:32.301
THERE'S NO WAY
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.302

17:33.385 --> 17:35.345

[whistle]

17:36.430 --> 17:38.849
HERE, BOY!

17:40.058 --> 17:42.686

BEFORE THE JUDGING BEGINS.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.688
HOW DOES A SPOT OF TEA SOUND?

17:44.772 --> 17:46.023
- MUSIC TO MY EARS.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.276
THEN I'LL GO OVER
AND SEE AMBER.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.986
I GO TO THE TROUBLE
TO BUY HER A PHONE,

17:51.069 --> 17:52.738
AND SHE NEVER ANSWERS IT.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.176
- I NEED TO BEAT MARA.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.345
- WHY ARE YOU SO DESPERATE?

18:16.428 --> 18:19.348
- BECAUSE MARA'S
BRILLIANT AND CLEVER,

18:19.431 --> 18:21.058
AND I'M...

18:21.141 --> 18:21.850

TO SEE THAT I'M NOT

18:21.934 --> 18:25.187

18:25.270 --> 18:26.188
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.190
- OH, BRILLIANT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.900
- THANK YOU.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.486
- THEY'RE NEARLY OUT OF BARS.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.238
- SO?

18:34.321 --> 18:35.447
- SO MR. MILLINGTON
CAN HARDLY JUDGE THEM

18:35.531 --> 18:39.034
IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
TO JUDGE, CAN HE?

18:39.117 --> 18:42.287
- YOU CAN'T STEAL
FROM YOUR OWN GIRLFRIEND.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.331

ABOUT STEALING?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.756

DIDN'T YOU?

19:34.840 --> 19:38.552

WANTING TO BE A PROPER DAD

19:41.096 --> 19:43.348

19:49.021 --> 19:50.939

SHE'S USING HIM.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.399

THAT THIS SOCIETY

19:52.482 --> 19:54.693

DENBY CAME ALONG.
