(camera shutter clicking)

00:22.956 --> 00:24.022
Oh! (laughs)

00:24.057 --> 00:25.924
I can't stop smiling!

00:25.959 --> 00:27.325
I feel like
the Cheshire cat.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.227
The smiling bit,
not the invisible bit.

00:29.262 --> 00:31.763
Audrey, your dress
is a-mazing.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.198
I love where you
put the jewel.

00:33.233 --> 00:36.201
Thanks! And you look
so totes fab, Jor!

00:36.236 --> 00:38.370
And I have no idea
what you just said.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.072
Oh, I can't wait anymore!

00:40.107 --> 00:41.373
I'm about to pop!

00:41.408 --> 00:42.541
Where is everyone?

00:42.576 --> 00:44.042
We need to start.

00:44.077 --> 00:47.212
Oh, don't they
understand the importance
of the Jewel-bilee?

00:47.247 --> 00:48.613
Forget the Jewel-bilee.

00:48.648 --> 00:51.083
I'm talking about
my musical number!

00:51.118 --> 00:52.718
Oh, where are they?

00:54.588 --> 00:56.388
Why, thank you,
Your Majesty.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.524
Yes, I do like
happily ever afters.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.359
-(chuckles)
-(door opens)

01:01.394 --> 01:02.561
-Mal: Ta-da.
-(gasps)

01:02.596 --> 01:04.396
You look amaz'!

01:04.431 --> 01:06.264
-I told you!
-Thanks.

01:06.299 --> 01:09.401
But I still don't think
I'm up for the Jewel-bilee.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.303
Come on. I'm sure
if we told them

01:11.338 --> 01:13.205
about the whole evil-spell-
on-your-hidden-jewel thing,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.406
they'd totally let you go.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.775
No. (chuckles)
I don't want to make a scene.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.577
Well, another scene.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.146
I mean, besides,
I can't get my jewel anyway.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.415
You know, it's cursed,
so what's the point?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.584
Well, if you're not going,
then I'm not going.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.085
I'd rather be here with you.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.120
(chuckles)

01:28.155 --> 01:30.388
You know, Evie,
you really are

01:30.423 --> 01:32.557
the best friend
that I could ever hope for.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.625
Aww.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.328
So... now what?

01:36.363 --> 01:38.296
You wanna try on my tiara?

01:38.331 --> 01:41.166
(chuckles)
Yeah, uh, I think I'll pass.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.002
Why aren't they here?

01:44.037 --> 01:46.304
Well, you did
un-invite Mal.

01:46.339 --> 01:49.508
It's a very merry
un-jewel-bilee for her.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.442
I know that.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.511
But what about Evie,
Freddie, and Jane?

01:52.546 --> 01:53.745
You think they're okay?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.847
Well, they won't be
when I get through with them.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.149
-(stomps foot forcefully)
-Whoa!

01:57.184 --> 01:58.517
-(buttons beeping)
-Got it.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.951
Hurry! If we're late,

01:59.986 --> 02:02.087
Audrey will smash us
like pumpkins!

02:02.122 --> 02:04.422
-(all clamoring)
-Look!

02:04.457 --> 02:08.160
Hey, who's tall,
dark, and turquoise over there?

02:08.195 --> 02:10.028
Jane:
He's reaching
into the throne room!

02:10.063 --> 02:12.364
Hey, fancy pants!
What are you doing over there?

02:12.399 --> 02:13.465
Show yourself!

02:15.468 --> 02:16.501
(shattering)

02:16.536 --> 02:17.669
-Hey, where'd he go?
-(low hissing)

02:20.407 --> 02:21.473
(all gasp)

02:21.508 --> 02:22.541
Ugh. Not you.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.109
What? Who is it?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.144
Allow me to introductory myself.

02:26.179 --> 02:28.513
I am Zevon, son of Yzma,

02:28.548 --> 02:31.316
and your worst nightmare!
