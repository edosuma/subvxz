01:40.600 --> 01:41.518
Don't be late!

01:42.393 --> 01:44.896
- Marcos, how are you?
-Good.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.641
I'm always talking
with my friends, and I tell them,

02:21.724 --> 02:23.101
"Do you know Benjamin Franklin?"

02:23.184 --> 02:25.562
They say, "No. Who is he?"

02:25.812 --> 02:28.231
And I tell them,
"This is Benjamin Franklin."

08:14.243 --> 08:15.703
Let's go to your house.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.352
Yes, in my hands.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.104
When we speak Spanish with a--

13:34.730 --> 13:35.815
When we speak--

13:36.690 --> 13:37.733
When-- hmm.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.239
When I speak Spanish,

13:43.656 --> 13:47.535
I get scared because I don't know when

13:47.618 --> 13:52.039
to put the words perfect-ly.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.002
I need to practice a lot

13:57.086 --> 13:59.630
with people who speak Spanish

13:59.713 --> 14:01.131
all the time.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.047
We want to help you.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.306
It hurt me so much that...

23:59.729 --> 24:02.858
It hurt to come home
and find out you were gone.

24:05.318 --> 24:08.780
Well, our relationship really bothered me.

24:09.698 --> 24:13.118
That's one of the reasons I left.

24:14.703 --> 24:19.124
I felt that being the first born,
you were hardest on me.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.670
And I think that's something that,
it scarred me,

24:23.753 --> 24:25.005
if you know what I mean.

24:26.756 --> 24:28.467
I understand, daughter. Um...

24:29.718 --> 24:33.346
I'm sorry for being so strict.

24:34.806 --> 24:39.019
I was just trying to make sure
nothing happened to you.

24:41.521 --> 24:45.901
I understand that
that wasn't the right way,

24:46.735 --> 24:48.236
but it's not easy.

24:52.115 --> 24:55.410
I sound like a song,
"They've asked me who my true love is,

24:55.494 --> 24:56.453
and I say,

24:57.662 --> 24:58.622
'my daughter.'"

25:02.125 --> 25:05.212
Well, I missed you a lot

25:05.921 --> 25:08.173
and during this time that I've been gone,

25:09.007 --> 25:09.883
I've learned a lot.

25:10.217 --> 25:13.220
I know that I need you.

25:14.763 --> 25:20.143
You're my dad, and I need you
to guide me and protect me because...

25:51.758 --> 25:55.762
Thank you. We needed
to have this talk a long time ago.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.648
- How are you?
- Very good.

28:11.606 --> 28:14.693
I think so, and I have faith in that, yes.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.780
I think that maybe my dad was too strict
with me,

28:18.863 --> 28:20.865
and I passed that on to my daughter.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.784
But I see that now,

28:22.867 --> 28:25.745
and I don't want
to make the same mistake in future.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.959
Very cute, precious, beautiful.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.015
Very good.

33:29.298 --> 33:33.094
Would you like to share
the name of your restaurant with us?

33:33.177 --> 33:34.220
For sure.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.920
Thanks, me too.

34:21.350 --> 34:24.771
I think I couldn't find the right moment.

34:25.271 --> 34:28.608
And you guys created the space
for it to take place.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.238
-Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.033
Let's play with your hair!

34:50.004 --> 34:51.714
This is all new for me.

35:24.580 --> 35:28.209
- Ready, guys?
-Yeah.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.426
I feel comfortable.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.197
This is your creation.

36:58.257 --> 37:01.844
I didn't think
you would notice that small detail.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.847
It's what has guided me during my journey.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.015
Thank you so much.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.879
I never thought I'd be
giving that name to my restaurant!

38:19.338 --> 38:20.423
But thank you!

39:32.620 --> 39:34.038
We've gone through a lot,

39:34.413 --> 39:39.043
but we've always had faith that
by working really hard,

39:39.377 --> 39:41.045
things will get better.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.465
Do you remember
when we were opening our first business

39:44.548 --> 39:45.633
unable to speak English?

39:46.092 --> 39:49.929
And we have grown in that regard,
we have learned.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.693
We are still missing--

40:21.252 --> 40:24.004
Now we are finally complete.

40:25.172 --> 40:28.759
I've been thinking a lot,
and I owe you guys an apology.

40:28.843 --> 40:35.808
I've been focused on growing the business
and overlooked our family.

40:42.356 --> 40:45.025
Also, Jennifer,
I owe you an apology as well.

40:45.651 --> 40:49.864
What I learned this week is
to dedicate more time to you

40:49.947 --> 40:55.161
and maybe that's
what I've been missing with you.

40:55.619 --> 41:00.624
That was my fault.
We won't keep doing that.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.251
And we'll keep moving forward.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.263
- Agreed.
- I love you guys a lot.

41:14.930 --> 41:17.892
I owe you guys a lot,
so thank you for your sacrifice, too.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.064
Who's gonna open the door?

41:24.148 --> 41:25.858
Me!

41:39.997 --> 41:40.915
The kitchen.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.715
I've always dreamed of using one of these!

41:52.343 --> 41:55.930
Let's wash our hands and get to work.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.474
-Working together!
- Yeah.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.731
Oh, people are gonna start arriving.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.858
Let's go, less talking.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.033
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

42:16.116 --> 42:18.410
Oh, so beautiful.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.913
Very good!

42:48.315 --> 42:49.692
What do you think of this idea?

42:56.323 --> 42:59.076
Hmm. This is your neighborhood.
You were born here.

42:59.159 --> 43:01.996
Your heart is here.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.167
I love you.

43:08.002 --> 43:13.132
I think that there are many other families
in the same situation as ours.

43:14.550 --> 43:18.762
That came to this country
to give our children a better life,

43:18.846 --> 43:21.974
but we neglect some important things.

43:22.474 --> 43:27.730
I want to thank the team for teaching me
that part of me that I'd lost

43:27.813 --> 43:29.565
and now have found again.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.737
I want to thank my family.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.822
They've given me support.

43:36.905 --> 43:40.534
They've put in a lot of effort,
mentally and physically.

43:57.843 --> 44:00.095
Let's keep this party going!

44:08.020 --> 44:09.855
-I love you lots.
-I love you, too.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.574
Yes, move it!
