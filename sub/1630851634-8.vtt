00:18.059 --> 00:19.310
[Joe] Previously on You:

00:19.394 --> 00:21.521
I need to look at particular people
on particular dates.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.983
I know Theo has a crush on me.
I could pretend like he had a chance.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.611
Love's first husband asked for a divorce.
Next thing you know, he was dead.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.489
[Joe] Look at you,
making the world more beautiful.

00:31.573 --> 00:35.160
I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I will stay ahead of her this time.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.661
Cary and I are polyamorous.

00:36.745 --> 00:40.498
And we would love to take
our relationship to a new level.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.293
Sherry and Cary would be a safe first try.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.546
[Joe] Opening our marriage? This loophole
cannot be falling into my lap.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.214
No idea is too crazy.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.175
For you.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.932
[Joe] Here's the thing, Marienne,

00:58.600 --> 01:02.062
I'm a monogamist.
Some might even say a serial monogamist.

01:02.145 --> 01:06.566
So imagine my surprise when my wife
suggested we read up on polyamory,

01:06.649 --> 01:10.445
aka swinging, aka the lifestyle,

01:10.528 --> 01:13.573
aka a flatlining marriage's dying gasp.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.033
Is it mortifying?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.412
[sighs] Well...

01:19.496 --> 01:21.831
"Happily ever after is a myth

01:21.915 --> 01:23.708
because people are not static.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.545
Our partners do not owe us a guarantee
that they will never change."

01:28.922 --> 01:31.174
Okay. It's not crazy.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.010
I'm gonna go check on Henry.
I think he'll wake up soon.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.474
I'm leaving out the part where if
your marriage isn't on rock-solid footing,

01:39.557 --> 01:42.185
swinging is all but guaranteed to nuke it,

01:42.268 --> 01:44.646
aka the dream.

01:46.356 --> 01:50.944
Still, after my conversation with Dottie
about the fate of Love's first husband,

01:51.027 --> 01:52.821
I need to tread lightly.

01:52.904 --> 01:56.449
Be game but not too. Make it all her idea.

02:09.921 --> 02:13.550
The Love I first met was a free spirit.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.345
Reality has disappointed her
since we moved to Madre Linda.

02:17.428 --> 02:22.976
I can make it easy to leave me,
no hard feelings, to go follow her bliss.

02:23.059 --> 02:26.271
I learned a new word. "Compersion."

02:26.354 --> 02:27.397
Yeah?

02:27.480 --> 02:33.111
Vicarious joy from seeing your partner
have joyful sexual relations with another.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.696
Hm.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.035
I don't know if this is a good idea.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.620
Shit. Too game.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.081
I'm not sure
we're in a solid enough place.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.292
Okay, back off for a while.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.962
Can I ask you something?

02:52.380 --> 02:55.341
Did you and James ever
do anything like this?

02:55.425 --> 02:58.887
No, he wasn't much of a risk taker.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.555
Plus...

03:01.806 --> 03:03.975
we weren't very far
into our marriage when...

03:04.058 --> 03:07.979
-Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to ask.
-No, it's fine.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.440
James didn't really know what he wanted.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.568
We were planning on having a baby,

03:14.819 --> 03:16.154
and he got cold feet.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.032
And then he got sick,

03:19.824 --> 03:23.828
which was obviously very scary.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.164
But he used it like a shield.

03:26.247 --> 03:31.169
And I wasn't, like,
allowed to be mad. Ever.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.754
I'm so sorry.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.340
That my wife almost definitely
murdered her first husband.

03:35.423 --> 03:36.925
It's fine. [chuckles softly]

03:37.008 --> 03:38.927
-I probably sound like an asshole.
-No.

03:39.010 --> 03:39.969
Worse.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.555
James let himself become
the villain of their story.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.183
I cannot be the villain of ours.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.100
Listen.

03:46.851 --> 03:50.897
I'm not going anywhere.
Let's not rush this swinging thing.

03:50.980 --> 03:51.898
It just--

03:53.191 --> 03:55.360
It isn't me.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.111
It isn't us.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.740
Which is exactly why we're going to do it.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.201
[theme music playing]

04:08.706 --> 04:10.583
Hey, Dante. You got a sec?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.168
Hey, yeah. What's up?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.086
Well...

04:14.379 --> 04:17.340
If you don't mind me asking,
you and Lansing,

04:18.466 --> 04:20.343
you guys have been together for how long?

04:20.426 --> 04:21.511
Let's see.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.848
We met when Lansing's boys were 3.
So 13 years.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.434
Stop me if this is too personal.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.563
Have you two always been monogamous?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.066
Are you asking because I'm gay?

04:36.150 --> 04:38.278
Oh, no. No, no, no. I--

04:38.361 --> 04:40.488
[laughs] I'm fucking with you.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.784
And the answer is, technically, no.

04:44.867 --> 04:45.910
Technically?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.745
We tried a threesome once.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.957
We'd been married a year
and our lives were just work,

04:51.040 --> 04:52.709
kids, eat, sleep, repeat.

04:52.792 --> 04:56.671
-But Lansing wanted to spice things up.
-How'd he convince you?

04:56.754 --> 04:57.672
Didn't have to.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.590
I love him so much.

04:59.674 --> 05:03.803
I thought if this is what he wanted,
I should at least try it.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.806
Just got off the phone with Amy Woodruff.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.225
That name is familiar because...?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.228
She edited every children's book
I'm obsessed with.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.855
-Great.
-Oh, that's cool.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.940
She was calling to congratulate me

05:16.024 --> 05:18.943
on being a finalist
in her imprint's illustration contest...

05:19.027 --> 05:21.946
-Congratulations.
-...which I did not submit for.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.992
But I seem to recall mentioning to you.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.370
Yeah, yeah. Guilty, I...

05:29.454 --> 05:31.831
I knew you wanted to submit, so--

05:31.914 --> 05:33.166
Dante give us a sec.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.625
[whistling]

05:37.337 --> 05:40.423
Was I not clear?
You're a married man, we are not a thing.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.092
No, we're friends. That's it.
But you missed the deadline

05:43.176 --> 05:45.094
-for the last submission.
-I did.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.557
Knowing how much
you beat yourself up over that, I just--

05:49.640 --> 05:52.018
Decided to do it for me?

05:52.101 --> 05:54.187
I decided to help
because I knew you would win.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.439
The world should see your work.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.692
They're my deadlines to miss.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.696
Yeah, message received.

06:03.780 --> 06:09.243
You're right. Listen, I'm not the type
of guy to go around sticking my nose in,

06:09.327 --> 06:11.788
so I'm sorry.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.206
Good.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.462
-Can I go back to being excited now?
-Please.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.839
[squeals]

06:24.592 --> 06:25.635
Um, I've gotta...

06:25.718 --> 06:27.220
-Fuck. Of course.
-Yep.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.847
[Joe] Great. It's Madre Linda's
most respected drug fiend.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.434
Your custody hearing is approaching
and suddenly I'm seeing a lot more of him.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.729
-Hi, Ryan.
-Well, you're in a good mood.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.149
Yeah, it's, um, been nice having Juliette.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.818
Smart to keep good news from him.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.320
-So you ready for that thing on Friday?
-That thing?

06:45.071 --> 06:48.449
Where you convince a judge that you're
not using our daughter to punish me?

06:48.533 --> 06:50.368
I would've rather worked things out
like adults.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.662
I thought that's what we were doing.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.790
Juliette, time to go.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.583
-Already?
-[Ryan] Don't argue.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.212
Let me help you, baby.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.214
[Joe] This is hard on your daughter.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.426
I wish I could fix it.
I wanna fix everything for you.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.553
-Did you have fun? All right.
-Mm-hm.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.479
Henry's down for the night.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.025
Hey.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.404
Come to bed.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.949
[Joe] Mm. Trying to reignite the spark,

07:30.032 --> 07:33.035
and my move here is make it not so easy.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.213
[sighs]

07:44.797 --> 07:45.673
Sorry.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.718
Long day.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.179
Okay.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.851
-How are we gonna get back to us?
-Love, I'm just tired.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.269
Yeah. Or bored.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.062
So far, so good.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.356
-No, I'm-- No, I--
-Maybe that's...

08:03.149 --> 08:04.942
just what marriage does.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.612
You know, I love us.

08:07.695 --> 08:12.158
It's-- But it's-- It's known.
You know, I want a secret.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.493
I wanna still be fun.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.786
-You are fun.
-No, I mean, like, wild.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.581
Like, you remember
those first few months we--

08:20.291 --> 08:22.251
-You know?
-Yeah.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.463
And now that's just over?

08:26.672 --> 08:30.051
Because I'm a mom and a wife,

08:30.885 --> 08:31.886
I can't be...?

08:34.680 --> 08:35.681
Be honest.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.810
Don't Sherry and Cary seem
more interesting

08:39.894 --> 08:41.646
now that we know they swing?

08:41.729 --> 08:45.441
-I thought you didn't want to.
-I don't know what I want.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.401
I got married so young.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.363
There's a lot of things
I never got to try.

08:50.446 --> 08:56.285
Well, the last thing I wanna do is stand
between you and anything you want.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.454
I have to guide her. Gently.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.166
Do you have any fantasies?

09:05.294 --> 09:07.088
Like, did you ever experiment?

09:07.171 --> 09:11.300
Okay, I made out drunkenly
with my college roommate, you know...

09:12.468 --> 09:14.095
-Total cliché.
-Total.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.972
See. Boring.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.975
No, I'm kidding.
I haven't done any experimenting either.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.060
-So you've never had a threesome?
-No.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.647
Unless you count under the bed
with Peach Salinger and her drug dealer.

09:24.730 --> 09:25.940
You ever kiss a guy?

09:28.276 --> 09:29.193
Would you?

09:29.902 --> 09:34.323
Under the right circumstances,
I don't see why not.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.161
Wow. Yeah, this is just fun
to talk about. [laughs]

09:39.245 --> 09:40.663
[Joe] Time to move to the next step.

09:40.746 --> 09:46.335
In all honesty, reading books is great.
But it does somehow feel clinical.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.755
We could talk to the experts.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.715
Bull's-eye.

09:50.798 --> 09:54.135
I'm sure Sherry and Cary would be happy
to give us a walk-through.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.429
I know you're not Sherry's biggest fan.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.014
[Joe] I'd rather fuck a cactus.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.766
We're talking strictly physical, right?

10:00.850 --> 10:04.979
It would be with Cary.
Also strictly physical.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.565
Yeah, I'm not threatened by Cary
in the slightest.

10:07.648 --> 10:11.402
-We would just be asking them questions.
-Yeah, we're not committing to anything.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.530
[Cary] The nondisclosure is mandatory.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.825
It's standard practice in a community
as tight-knit as ours.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.744
So do you do a lot of these?

10:19.827 --> 10:23.080
Can't confirm or deny but, I mean,

10:23.164 --> 10:27.877
everyone in Madre Linda has tried
the lifestyle at some point.

10:28.586 --> 10:32.089
[Joe] Huh. The burbs are even more
miserable than I thought.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.092
Um-- I, um...

10:37.845 --> 10:40.598
Aw, damn you.

10:40.681 --> 10:44.018
Oh, yeah, those look worth fucking
my glycemic variability for.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.645
Okay. Well...

10:46.771 --> 10:48.356
-Mm.
-Here you go.

10:59.241 --> 11:04.955
So, when you started the lifestyle,
were you two already in a good place?

11:07.041 --> 11:08.626
Not as good as we are now.

11:08.709 --> 11:14.548
Our marriage grew rock solid
through these little trust falls.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.342
We can take you through a Q and A.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.428
You know, no "presh,"
you'll see, the whole thing, it's very...

11:20.638 --> 11:22.056
You're in control.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.058
Great. Okay.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.937
So let's just get started.
Obviously, STIs we should know about?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.605
-No.
-Good.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.732
Love, let's talk menstruation.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.402
Um, I'm not due for another three weeks.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.653
Cycle twins.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.029
[laughing]

11:37.113 --> 11:39.824
And our kids are at camp through August.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.243
Okay, well, we--

11:42.910 --> 11:44.995
We have a great babysitter.

11:45.079 --> 11:49.083
Henry could stay
the night there if, you know...

11:49.166 --> 11:51.961
[Joe] Suddenly this feels real.
They really are pros.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.756
Well, let's get to the fun stuff.
What are you comfy with?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.551
Joe, start with an easy one.

11:58.634 --> 12:02.263
Are you good
with Love and I getting physical?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.348
Yeah.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.767
Girl-on-girl, usually a given.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.893
Love and Cary.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.855
[Joe] I couldn't care less
but can't appear too game.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.440
I mean...

12:14.608 --> 12:15.609
I trust you.

12:16.944 --> 12:21.198
Love, are you good
with Joe and Cary fooling around?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.116
Sure.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.160
But-- Are you...?

12:26.203 --> 12:29.915
For the public,
the brand is conventional monogamy.

12:30.666 --> 12:34.837
Some don't understand that
a bisexual man is a truly optimized man.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.217
Okay, I can keep an open mind.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.471
For you, Marienne,
I will walk through fire.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.723
-What about Joe and me?
-Seeing as Love killed

12:45.806 --> 12:47.892
-the last woman I almost slept with...
-That's a no.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.603
-It's fine by me. What do you mean?
-I...

12:50.686 --> 12:52.688
-Do you not want to?
-No, no, no. I thought--

12:52.772 --> 12:53.898
Why?

12:54.648 --> 12:57.109
-Because...
-Okay. Moving too fast.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.779
-Yeah.
-Oh, what's happening?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.822
We've been doing this a while,

13:01.906 --> 13:04.200
and we can tell
when a foundation's a little shaky.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.411
No shame, it's just you two are so...

13:09.872 --> 13:10.706
young.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.502
Hit us up if you get on the same page.

13:17.588 --> 13:21.217
-What the fuck just happened?
-[Joe] A major setback.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.719
[Dante] Miss Bellamy.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.057
Let's talk about your day-to-day routine
with visitation.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.100
Who prepares your child's meals?

13:30.184 --> 13:35.147
When Juliette's with me, I do.
When she's with Ryan, his mother does.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.442
'Cause Juliette loves the taste
of unseasoned chicken.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.362
[Joe] Even when you're practicing
for court, you're still delightful.

13:41.445 --> 13:44.281
Excellent. Don't say that last part.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.117
How would you describe
your recovery from addiction?

13:47.201 --> 13:51.330
-Well, I have my weekly meetings...
-Nope. In the four years since.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.041
-Give me a second.
-She's doing really well.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.459
She needs to be perfect.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.920
I stand before you
with an Ivy League education

13:58.003 --> 13:59.797
and two successful stepsons.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.050
We have been trying to adopt
for three years.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.094
There's always a snag.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.512
I'm being hard on you

14:06.595 --> 14:10.224
-because I know what you're up against.
-I know. I'm trying, I just...

14:10.307 --> 14:12.685
The fucker is plotting something,
and I can feel it.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.855
We'll get there. Keep practicing.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.941
Thank you, Dante.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.984
[phone buzzing]

14:20.067 --> 14:23.404
And I gotta go give Charlie
his lunch break.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.245
-Can I actually talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.673
So I know it's a lot to ask,

14:42.756 --> 14:47.094
but it would mean so much to me
if you would be a character witness

14:47.177 --> 14:48.053
at my hearing?

14:48.137 --> 14:51.473
Of course. You're an incredible asset
to the library.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.933
Cool. Great. Thanks.

14:53.017 --> 14:57.855
But I actually need you to play up
the whole kick-ass mom thing.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.276
I will character witness
the motherly living shit out of you.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.277
Thank you.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.579
Um...

15:16.332 --> 15:18.167
Yeah, thank you. Uh--

15:20.628 --> 15:22.379
[Joe] That was hope.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.131
The least I can do...

15:25.132 --> 15:27.384
is hasten the end of my marriage.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.681
[phone buzzing]

15:37.895 --> 15:39.396
Speak of the devil.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.657
I guess we're having fun now.

15:51.325 --> 15:56.121
The swinging book say to test your comfort
by role-playing little scenarios.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.499
Okay, here we go.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.919
The fuck?

16:03.504 --> 16:06.173
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's my bad.

16:08.092 --> 16:13.180
You know, it's-- It's not the most subtle
come-here of my life,

16:13.263 --> 16:16.767
but I'm really--
I'm not complaining about it.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.480
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't even see you there.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.400
[Joe] Role-playing gets complicated fast,
evidently.

16:24.483 --> 16:28.445
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't mean to throw this over here.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.947
-[chuckles]
-Um...

16:31.031 --> 16:33.951
I saw Joe's car in the driveway.

16:34.034 --> 16:34.868
Yeah.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.663
He's taking a nap.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.460
I know--
I know I should be chill but, like...

16:44.211 --> 16:45.087
Theo.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.590
Oh.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.430
You know, actually, Joe--
That's Joe. He's awake.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.184
And he's watching us.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.149
Well, then we better behave.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.443
Right.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.821
Wait, um, the--

17:11.447 --> 17:12.698
Your dad. The office?

17:12.781 --> 17:15.868
Yeah, I don't know. It's like--
It's impossible.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.411
Okay.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.581
But I'll figure it out.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.708
I will.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.044
Okay.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.088
You're the best.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.387
Fucking creep show.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.235
Theo's still circling Matthew,
but he'll get there.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.029
I gathered.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.113
Did you?

17:54.031 --> 17:54.865
Yeah.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.992
How did that make you feel?

17:59.495 --> 18:00.537
Jealous?

18:02.081 --> 18:05.000
[Joe]
A large amount of nothing. However...

18:05.084 --> 18:06.460
Possessive.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.629
Yeah?

18:08.712 --> 18:11.548
My wife needs to feel
like mildly transgressing

Still the Love Quinn who flirts
with strangers in the produce section.

18:35.030 --> 18:40.285
Which is why I'm going to satisfy her
as only someone who knows her can.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.377
We can do anything together.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.683
Satisfied but still hungry.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.399
I love you so much.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.319
That felt safe?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.155
So safe.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.447
Solid.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.914
Do you think we're solid?
I think we're solid.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.252
-I mean, if you think we are...
-Yeah.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.296
You'll call the sitter? I'll text Sherry.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.048
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.495
-Theo. What happened?
-The Wi-Fi went out.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.122
-What?
-The Wi-Fi went out.

20:08.624 --> 20:12.711
Okay, it's probably a brownout.
Just give it a minute.

20:15.464 --> 20:19.134
Do you think it has to do with the dozens
of servers you snuck into your office?

20:22.429 --> 20:25.515
Are you sleeping okay?
Are you getting enough to eat?

20:25.599 --> 20:27.517
Me? Yeah, I'm good.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.436
-Okay. Good.
-You?

20:32.522 --> 20:36.151
Uh... No. I'm-- Yeah, obviously, I'm--

20:37.778 --> 20:40.405
A bit of a rabbit hole. I know.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.952
But if there's something--
If you wanna talk about...

20:45.869 --> 20:51.750
Yeah, can we talk about how, like,
people aren't built to live in an office?

20:53.210 --> 20:57.297
Without, like, taking a walk or something,
so their brain can air out.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.215
Right.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.302
Do you wanna walk
to Pobrecito's right now?

21:02.386 --> 21:04.972
We could get some tacos.
We could hang out.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.391
Yeah, I know. I--

21:08.809 --> 21:10.560
Yeah, I'd love that. Um...

21:12.938 --> 21:16.024
I gotta send this thing tonight though.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.027
It's like-- It's a letter to the dean

21:19.111 --> 21:22.698
asking if I can drop in
on the classes that I'm missing.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.117
-Really? That's great.
-Yeah. I'm sorry.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.077
I mean, I really-- I am hungry.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.204
Well, no, no, that's great.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.124
I'll bring you something back.
What do you want? Al pastor?

21:32.207 --> 21:34.835
Yeah, yeah. That'd be great. Thanks, Dad.

21:34.918 --> 21:35.794
Sure.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.391
Okay, okay, okay.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.952
What the fuck?

22:14.916 --> 22:16.460
It's scary, isn't it?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.004
What is this?

22:20.130 --> 22:23.300
You planted cameras, like--
Like, all over town?

22:23.383 --> 22:26.720
No, no, no. They were there.
I'm just accessing them.

22:26.803 --> 22:27.804
Accessing. But--

22:28.722 --> 22:31.641
You realize
that this is domestic abuse, right?

22:31.725 --> 22:33.393
That you so casually access.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.980
I wouldn't be looking at Love
if she weren't connected to Natalie.

22:39.066 --> 22:39.983
Or you.

You tell me.

What is it you think
you're doing with Love Quinn?

22:53.997 --> 22:55.832
-You spied on me?
-I didn't spy on you.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.418
-What? You're accusing Love of murder?
-No.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.380
I don't have proof yet.

23:01.463 --> 23:05.384
But either way, she's a married woman

some anger management problem.

27:10.128 --> 27:15.592
♪ Fill my mind with dirtiness
I'll invade your dreams ♪

27:16.801 --> 27:19.679
Come on. I wanna show you
what I set up in the bedroom.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.473
[Joe] And I'm officially terrified.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.817
I did say I'd endure torture for you.

27:32.901 --> 27:37.238
All right. Just remember,
tonight is a marathon, it is not a sprint.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.283
We have to have each other's backs.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.618
I got you covered.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.166
My magic potions.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.294
Stimulants, lab-grade shrooms,

27:51.378 --> 27:52.754
liquid downregulation,

27:52.837 --> 27:56.716
killer rest-and-recovery aid
but strong as dick.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.595
I KO'd myself, like, six times
before getting my dosage right.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.223
Yes.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.851
This boosts testosterone like a mofo.

28:06.935 --> 28:07.769
Okay.

28:12.315 --> 28:13.233
For you.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.070
[Joe]
Actually, I probably need it tonight.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.074
Okay. Down the hatch.

28:24.911 --> 28:25.745
Thattaboy.

28:26.913 --> 28:27.789
Now...

28:29.791 --> 28:32.585
allow me to introduce you to my ritual

28:33.420 --> 28:34.587
for a night like tonight.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.263
[humming]

28:44.139 --> 28:45.348
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.267
Oh, Marienne.

28:47.350 --> 28:51.521
You are the only one who could make
whatever's about to happen worthwhile.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.319
It's okay, you can look at it.

29:00.613 --> 29:01.948
Look at my dick.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.369
Welcome to the real party, brother.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.047
So glad you're here.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.515
What the fuck is happening?

29:38.318 --> 29:39.819
If you don't wanna fuck yourself,

29:39.903 --> 29:42.822
how is someone else gonna
wanna fuck you, my man?

29:42.906 --> 29:46.785
Oh, of course. Cary is Cary-sexual.

29:47.660 --> 29:52.123
Well, don't just stare.
Grab a mirror, join in.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.833
[phone buzzes]

29:53.917 --> 29:55.168
[Joe] My savior.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.212
Cary, you know what?
This is our babysitter.

29:57.295 --> 30:01.508
-Real quick. Real quick, real quick.
-Hey, we said no... phones.

30:01.591 --> 30:02.967
[moans]

30:03.384 --> 30:04.219
Hey.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.722
-Is everything okay?
-I'm sorry.

30:07.806 --> 30:11.184
I didn't know who else to call
'cause I have no friends because of him.

30:12.101 --> 30:12.936
Ryan?

30:13.603 --> 30:16.564
An anonymous e-mail went out
to all of my contacts.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.150
I know it was him
because there were photos,

30:19.234 --> 30:24.614
-explicit photos that only he has and...
-Oh, no. I know those photos.

30:24.697 --> 30:28.493
And one of the people he sent it to
is Amy Woodruff, the editor,

30:28.576 --> 30:30.537
the children's book editor.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.913
And... And...

30:33.414 --> 30:35.208
Now she'll never work with me.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.669
[Joe] He is truly evil.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.045
I'm so sorry.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.468
I knew he was up to something.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.597
He fucking gets off on this shit.

30:54.894 --> 30:59.190
The worst part about being married is
that they actually know you so well

30:59.274 --> 31:01.651
that they can just use it
for the rest of your life.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.862
Listen to me, those photos,

31:05.113 --> 31:07.824
I know, sane people know,
Ryan weaponized them,

31:07.907 --> 31:12.871
and that makes him the bad guy
and a disgusting excuse for a human being.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.999
How am I supposed
to look at him in court tomorrow?

31:16.082 --> 31:19.294
With pity. He's a piece of shit
and you're gonna win.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.296
The rest...

31:22.213 --> 31:24.966
we'll figure out, okay?

31:27.468 --> 31:28.511
I'll help you,

31:28.595 --> 31:31.723
if and only if you ask me to, of course.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.020
Um...

31:38.146 --> 31:40.356
Do you wanna come over?

31:41.190 --> 31:42.191
I just...

31:43.359 --> 31:45.069
I could really use a friend.

31:46.112 --> 31:47.739
[Joe] I'd give anything to.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.033
[Cary]
Joe, where the fuck are you, brother?

31:51.701 --> 31:53.411
I wish I could, but...

31:54.412 --> 31:56.414
No, no, no. It's okay.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.626
No, you've actually-- You've done enough.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.254
Thanks for answering, Goldberg.

32:13.723 --> 32:16.392
You missed the finale in there.
Give it to me.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.437
This will go in the phone bowl downstairs
with everybody else's.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.439
[women giggling]

32:21.522 --> 32:24.233
Well, it's go time.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.492
Oh, welcome back.

32:34.577 --> 32:35.745
I missed you.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.121
[Joe] Someone's loose.

32:39.582 --> 32:42.168
-Are you okay? You still seem tense.
-You think?

32:42.251 --> 32:45.171
-I'm good. No, I'm good.
-He's just a little shy.

32:59.268 --> 33:02.772
Oh, okay, so this is really happening.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.194
Uh-- Mm. Ow.

33:10.780 --> 33:11.864
Watch.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.127
Is there something wrong?

33:26.337 --> 33:27.797
Are you okay with this?

33:29.424 --> 33:30.717
More than okay.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.677
[Joe] I'm embarrassed for us.

33:47.859 --> 33:48.943
Ooh.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.657
This is fine. This is great, even.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.662
Sorry to ask twice,
but is there something wrong?

33:59.746 --> 34:02.248
Hey, sweetie,
just wait for the pill to kick in.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.458
Oh, yeah.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.793
I'm not used to an audience, I think.

34:05.877 --> 34:10.631
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Just remember, look at your partner.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.010
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, go.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.848
But I don't want Love,
I don't want Sherry.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.852
I don't want any of this.
All I want is you.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.152
There you are.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.945
There you are.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.287
I knew you'd come.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.222
[moans]

35:02.767 --> 35:05.478
Big boy. [grunts]

35:09.023 --> 35:09.941
Yes.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.115
[moaning loudly]

35:35.216 --> 35:36.717
Hakuna matata!

35:36.801 --> 35:38.719
-Gotta be fucking kidding me.
-Fuck!

35:40.179 --> 35:44.100
-Fuck. Somehow I just became the bad guy.
-No, it's okay. It's all right.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.690
[Joe] Shit.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.696
I cannot let her blame me
for this shit show.

36:02.451 --> 36:03.327
Hey.

36:07.999 --> 36:08.958
What happened?

36:13.004 --> 36:13.963
Who is she?

36:16.090 --> 36:17.133
Excuse me?

36:20.344 --> 36:22.138
Who were you thinking about just then?

36:23.055 --> 36:26.142
Nobody. Just you. It's always you.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.101
Bullshit.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.355
I know you, Joe.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.442
I know what I do will never
be good enough for you.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.446
This was your idea.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.281
Well, I had to do something.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.282
Or what?

36:42.241 --> 36:45.328
Why do you act like I'm not all in?
I am right here.

36:46.245 --> 36:48.247
All I do is worry about you.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.957
I don't need you to worry about me.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.211
I need your heart.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.464
-Henry needs your heart.
-Leave Henry out of this.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.924
I can't, Joe.

36:58.966 --> 37:02.637
Unlike you, I have to be his mother 24/7.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.223
In addition to running a fucking business,

37:05.306 --> 37:08.517
keeping this house together,
dragging you to therapy,

37:08.601 --> 37:12.146
trying to be my sexiest self so you don't
get bored and find another Natalie.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.316
-Can you please lower your voice?
-Why? You hate hearing the truth?

37:15.399 --> 37:19.695
-Our marriage is completely one-sided.
-That is absurd.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.322
You made me kill her.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.741
In addition
to being mother of the fucking year,

37:23.824 --> 37:26.452
I had to run interference
on one of your fucking patterns!

37:26.535 --> 37:28.621
-I killed Natalie for you!
-Shut...

37:29.872 --> 37:30.748
up.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.375
[floor creaking]

37:40.508 --> 37:41.884
Was that...?

37:41.968 --> 37:43.219
[Joe] Fuck me.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.846
Maybe they didn't hear anything.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.432
We have to know for sure.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.144
Okay, well,

37:53.854 --> 37:56.357
Sherry has this tell when she's lying,
she scratches her arm.

37:58.609 --> 37:59.944
I'll follow your lead.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.406
Okay.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.251
[both moaning]

38:15.334 --> 38:17.253
-There you are.
-Hey.

38:17.336 --> 38:19.463
Take any longer,
I'd have to shuck the corn again.

38:19.547 --> 38:23.676
I'm so sorry, guys. I just got in my head.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.052
I'm good now.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.347
I hope I didn't kill the vibe.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.058
Oh, my God, of course not.

38:31.142 --> 38:34.020
-It's so easy to get overwhelmed.
-Yeah.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.104
Yeah.

38:36.022 --> 38:36.856
Now...

38:37.064 --> 38:38.190
[clears throat]

38:39.775 --> 38:40.943
where were we?

38:45.364 --> 38:47.658
[Joe] I just can't tell.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.453
Something wrong?

38:50.536 --> 38:55.124
Oh, I'm great.
Why don't we get on the bed?

39:04.383 --> 39:05.259
Go.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.766
Hey, Sherry.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.647
[both grunting]

39:20.024 --> 39:23.694
I don't know what you think you heard...

39:26.155 --> 39:27.323
But we're...

39:33.371 --> 39:34.622
[yelps]

39:35.247 --> 39:38.084
There you go.
It's gonna end badly for Love too.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.960
Sherry knows Krav Maga.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.338
Go to sleep, buddy.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.551
[yells]

40:17.415 --> 40:18.582
[Sherry] Let me go!

40:19.917 --> 40:22.044
No! No, please! No! God!

40:22.128 --> 40:23.754
[Joe] That does not sound good.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.382
He could be at Matthew's by now.

40:37.893 --> 40:41.188
Guess I'm gonna use Cary's gift
from the hunting trip after all.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.736
[shouts]

40:57.121 --> 41:00.374
Cary, let's go back inside.
We can talk about this.

41:06.213 --> 41:09.925
This is it. I never see you again.

41:11.218 --> 41:13.762
I get impaled, Love goes to prison.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.515
Henry grows up in the system.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.103
No.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.068
[Cary screams]

42:47.439 --> 42:48.482
Are you okay?

43:19.054 --> 43:20.764
[moaning]

43:35.279 --> 43:36.905
Holy fucking shit.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.243
I think that was the best sex
we've ever had.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.579
[Joe] Yes, it was.

43:44.330 --> 43:48.000
The spark our marriage needed
doesn't come from swinging.

43:49.501 --> 43:51.754
Our love language is violence.

44:07.269 --> 44:08.103
[Joe] Shit.

44:11.273 --> 44:14.902
-Hey.
-What happened to the car?

44:16.278 --> 44:20.240
Love spilled fruit sauce.
So I'm just getting it before it sets in.

44:20.324 --> 44:21.617
At 5 a.m.?

44:22.993 --> 44:24.328
Couldn't sleep.

44:24.411 --> 44:26.413
Doesn't look like he's gotten much either.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.498
You okay?

44:32.586 --> 44:33.796
What was that last night?

44:33.879 --> 44:37.257
Last night? Oh, we were--
I mean, were we that loud?

44:38.133 --> 44:41.637
We had a kid with a sitter,
had a little fun.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.264
With the Conrads? I saw their car.

44:45.391 --> 44:48.227
Yeah, they were here for a second. Yeah.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.520
Oh.

44:50.646 --> 44:52.523
I thought I heard someone scream.

44:55.818 --> 45:00.823
It was drunken shenanigans.
It was harmless, really. I'm embarrassed.

45:00.906 --> 45:02.908
Stupid fun, really.

45:02.991 --> 45:06.328
Yeah, you and your wife, Love.
Just having fun.

45:08.956 --> 45:13.127
Yeah, again,
I apologize if it disturbed you.

45:13.210 --> 45:16.130
We were saying we should have you over
for dinner sometime soon.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.048
Yeah, real busy with work. But sometime.

45:19.842 --> 45:20.759
Sometime.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.500
I put my best friend...

45:55.043 --> 45:56.628
in a cage.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.340
Oh, my God.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.554
I am so grateful for you.

46:07.014 --> 46:10.225
I don't know anybody else
who would understand.

46:11.226 --> 46:13.437
I don't know what I'd do without you.

46:21.653 --> 46:22.571
Okay.

46:23.322 --> 46:24.907
I'm gonna make breakfast

46:24.990 --> 46:29.411
and then I can contact Henry's sitter
to see if they'll take him longer.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.163
We can just clean up.

46:31.246 --> 46:33.582
We'll go over there.
We'll "good cop, bad cop" them.

46:33.665 --> 46:36.543
[Joe] She's too good at this now.
This should not be routine.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.587
We will get through this, okay?

46:38.670 --> 46:43.133
I don't want to, I want you--
Shit. Your custody hearing.

46:44.134 --> 46:45.093
Joe?

46:45.177 --> 46:49.598
I forgot, I promised to fill in for Dante.
He's got a thing and I have to--

46:49.681 --> 46:53.310
I'll be fast, meet you soon as I'm done.
Don't do anything until I get there.

46:55.938 --> 46:58.941
-You are, as ever, an inspiration.
-Thank you.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.777
Well, that happened.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.862
-You killed it.
-You were so great.

47:03.946 --> 47:06.156
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Flawless, unimpeachable.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.367
Dare I say, unironically,
mother of the year.

47:08.450 --> 47:11.161
I'm so glad you were here. Both of you.

47:12.746 --> 47:13.831
Thank you.

47:20.337 --> 47:21.797
[inaudible dialogue]

47:23.924 --> 47:25.259
What was that?

47:26.218 --> 47:28.512
Are Ryan and the judge friends?

47:32.224 --> 47:35.269
You were right. The system is rigged.

47:35.352 --> 47:37.604
Come on, Dante. We're gonna go.

47:39.189 --> 47:42.985
And as long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.078
Hey. You good?

47:54.454 --> 47:56.456
Yeah, I'm okay. What about--?

47:56.540 --> 47:59.668
Oh, they're-- They're just waking up.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.216
Hey.

48:08.051 --> 48:09.678
We're a team, okay?

48:11.346 --> 48:12.806
Till death do us part.

48:12.890 --> 48:16.393
[Joe] Clearly, my plan has backfired.
My wife seems more into me than ever.

48:32.326 --> 48:36.788
Swinging was supposed to be
my marriage's dying gasp, not theirs.

48:39.207 --> 48:43.086
How the fuck are these two
getting out of here alive?

48:47.090 --> 48:48.800
