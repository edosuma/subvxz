[DES] I DON'T KNOW MAN.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.610
[JAKE] WE'RE ABOUT TO ENTER A
CRIME SCENE! YOU HAVE TO BE

12:19.650 --> 12:21.650

12:54.600 --> 12:57.940
[JAKE] WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT NOT TOUCHING THINGS?

12:57.980 --> 12:59.690
IT'S A BULLET.

12:59.730 --> 13:03.070
WHO KNEW THE CHIP TRUCK GAME
WAS SUCH A HARD RACKET.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.610
C'MON.

13:06.030 --> 13:07.990
&lt;♪♪&gt;

13:08.030 --> 13:09.580
[DES] HOW MANY TRUCKS HE GOT?

13:09.620 --> 13:10.910
[JAKE] TWO.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.370
THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S
NOT STOLEN.

13:12.410 --> 13:15.000
[DES] SO ZIGGY GIVES OUT
BULLETPROOF VEST AS
STANDARD ISSUE?

13:15.040 --> 13:16.210
HE MUST GO THROUGH A LOT
OF STAFF.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.750
&lt;JAKE'S PHONE RINGS&gt;
[JAKE] HOLD ON.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.880

13:29.430 --> 13:30.930
[NIKKI] NO, NO.
OKAY IT'S NOT THAT.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.890
IT'S JUST I FOUND YOUR
MOTHER'S RING.

13:32.930 --> 13:34.890
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
HAVE IT.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.980
[JAKE] I DON'T WANT IT.
[NIKKI] DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

13:37.020 --> 13:39.230
[JAKE] LOOK IF THE THING IS
CURSED OKAY? MY MOM WEARS IT,

13:39.270 --> 13:43.030
SHE DIES, YOU WEAR IT,

GIVE IT TO THAT GUY ON TV.

13:43.070 --> 13:45.200
HE PAYS CASH FOR REAL GOLD.

13:45.240 --> 13:49.200
OR YOU COULD BOIL IT DOWN
YOU KNOW MAKE SOME NICE
EARRINGS OUT OF IT.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.540
[NIKKI] CAN YOU BE SERIOUS
PLEASE, JUST FOR ONE SECOND?

13:51.580 --> 13:52.370

14:03.090 --> 14:05.840
&lt;♪♪&gt;

14:12.850 --> 14:14.850
[ZIGGY] OH HEY, IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:14.890 --> 14:15.850
IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:15.890 --> 14:18.270

14:22.110 --> 14:24.860
&lt;♪♪&gt;

14:27.110 --> 14:27.910
[NIKKI] TWO MORE SECONDS AND

14:27.950 --> 14:30.990
THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN
READY TO SERVE.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.290
[ZIGGY] WHO'S HE?
[DES] OH I'M DES, HIS PARTNER.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.410
[NIKKI] IT'S A SECOND-DEGREE
BURN. BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

14:35.450 --> 14:37.830
JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP
THEM LIGHTLY WRAPPED AND
CLEAN AND DRY

14:37.870 --> 14:39.920
AND THE SILVADENE SHOULD
DO THE REST.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.880
[ZIGGY] ALRIGHT, YOU'RE AN
ANGEL AND YOU'RE HOT.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.670

[JAKE] HEY.

14:53.100 --> 14:53.930
PLEASE...

14:53.970 --> 14:56.390
AT LEAST-- JUST--
CAN YOU TAKE IT FOR MAL?

14:56.430 --> 14:57.850
[JAKE] FOR--
WHAT'S MAL GONNA DO WITH IT?

14:57.890 --> 14:58.520
GIVE IT TO ROSE?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.060
THAT'LL GO OVER WELL.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.480
I MEAN I ALREADY RUINED ONE
RELATIONSHIP SO I DON'T WANNA

15:01.520 --> 15:02.770
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIRS,
YOU KNOW?

15:02.820 --> 15:03.900
[NIKKI] WELL HE MIGHT--

15:03.940 --> 15:05.400
I'M SORRY WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

15:05.440 --> 15:07.400
[JAKE] ROSE IS A GREAT GAL
BUT, I MEAN I'M PRETTY SURE

15:07.440 --> 15:09.030
SHE DOESN'T WANT
MY DEAD MOM'S RING.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.200
[NIKKI] NOT THAT PART.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.280
YOU...

15:11.320 --> 15:12.490
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
THAT YOU ARE AWARE

15:12.530 --> 15:14.080
THAT IT WAS YOU
WHO RUINED OUR MARRIAGE.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.250
THAT'S-- THAT SHOWS GROWTH.
REALLY.

15:17.290 --> 15:19.000
[JAKE] THE RING IS YOURS.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.790
IT ALWAYS WAS, REGARDLESS TO
WHATEVER MESS YOU MADE,

15:21.830 --> 15:24.000
I MADE TO OUR MARRIAGE.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.380
[NIKKI] JAKE IT'S NOT--

15:25.420 --> 15:26.630
[JAKE] MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE
WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.130
SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED YOU.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.090
SHE'D WANT YOU TO BE
THE KEEPER OF THAT RING.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.090
[NIKKI] IF YOU'D SAID THAT TO
ME WHEN WE WERE MARRIED,

15:32.140 --> 15:34.470
THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE
DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

15:34.510 --> 15:36.060
[JAKE] MAYBE.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.680
OR MAYBE I JUST SAID IT
TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO TAKE IT BACK.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.730
[NIKKI] AND THERE IS THE REASON
WHY WE'RE NOT MARRIED ANYMORE.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.820
TELL YOUR FRIEND
TO USE THE CREAM.

15:46.860 --> 15:48.070
[JAKE] I WILL.

15:51.990 --> 15:53.530
[DES] SO YOU NEVER SAW
ANY FACES?

15:53.570 --> 15:55.330
[ZIGGY] DID YOU NOTICE
THE MASKS?
[DES] YEAH I DID,

15:55.370 --> 15:57.200
BUT MAYBE THEY PUT THE MASKS ON
AFTER THEY ATTACKED YOU.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.700
DID YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.910
[JAKE] JUST-- WOULD YOU--
GIMME THAT.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.210
SIT DOWN.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.790
[ZIGGY] YOUR PARTNER HERE IS
GRILLING ME.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.330
[JAKE] HE IS NOT MY PARTNER.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.170
WHY DO YOU HAVE BULLETPROOF
VESTS INSIDE YOUR CHIP TRUCK?

16:07.210 --> 16:08.880
[ZIGGY] I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.220
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY WERE
LOOKING FOR SID, OKAY?

16:11.260 --> 16:12.300
[DES] YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR
MAN.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.220
[JAKE] SHUT UP!

16:14.260 --> 16:15.640
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.220
[ZIGGY] LOOK I DIDN'T HIRE YOU
GUYS TO CALL ME NAMES,

16:18.270 --> 16:21.270
JUST TAKE ME TO MY TRUCK.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.560
[JAKE] OKAY.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.610
&lt;♪♪&gt;

16:59.390 --> 17:01.100
[JAKE] YOU LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING THERE, CHA CHI?

17:01.140 --> 17:03.100
[ZIGGY] NO, I JUST WANTED TO
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS STILL

17:03.140 --> 17:07.230
HERE, YOU KNOW?
[JAKE] RIGHT.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.320
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE
HELLS GOING ON?

17:09.360 --> 17:11.280
[ZIGGY] NO HONESTLY GUYS,

17:11.320 --> 17:13.990
AND I'M WORRIED TO DEATH ABOUT
HIM. YOU GOTTA FIND HIM ALRIGHT?

17:14.030 --> 17:15.860
[JAKE] OKAY, WELL IF THIS
IS A MISSING PERSON'S CASE,

17:15.910 --> 17:17.620
WE REALLY DO HAVE TO
GO TO THE COPS.

17:17.660 --> 17:20.410
[ZIGGY] WELL NO, YOU CAN'T
CAUSE SID HAS GOT PROBATION IN

17:20.450 --> 17:23.290
CORNER BROOK AND IF THEY FIND
HIM HERE IN ST. JOHNS,

17:23.330 --> 17:27.210
THEN THEY'RE GONNA PUT HIM IN
JAIL FOR B&amp;E.

17:27.250 --> 17:28.840
[JAKE] RIGHT.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.260
WELL WE FOUND YOUR TRUCK.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.300
NOW YOU GOTTA PAY ME.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.760
[ZIGGY] AH, C'MON JAKE.

I HOPE YOU CAN DRIVE.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.230
[DES] YEAH. YEAH!

17:51.320 --> 17:53.110
[JAKE] OH MY GOD, IT SMELLS
LIKE A DEEP FRYER IN HERE.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.280
I CAN ACTUALLY FEEL MY
CHOLESTEROL GOING UP.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.360
[DES] ACTUALLY, MOST FOOD
TODAY IS COOKED IN

17:57.410 --> 17:59.030
NON-HYDROGENATED OILS,

18:16.260 --> 18:19.260
[JAKE] BECAUSE YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES IT'S NICE
TO HELP PEOPLE.

18:21.510 --> 18:22.930
&lt;RAP MUSIC FROM TRUCK STEREO&gt;

18:22.970 --> 18:24.180
[JAKE] AH!

18:55.710 --> 18:57.930

25:11.970 --> 25:13.720
[JAKE] OH YEAH, MAYBE HE GOT

25:13.760 --> 25:16.050
WHEN WE FOUND THE TRUCK YOU
WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

25:16.090 --> 25:17.180
IT WAS THE DRUGS, WASN'T IT?

25:17.220 --> 25:18.930
[ZIGGY] NO!

25:29.150 --> 25:29.980
UNTIL THEY MOVED IT.

25:30.030 --> 25:32.530
IT WAS OFF-SITE BUT NEARBY.
ALRIGHT?

25:32.570 --> 25:33.990
[JAKE] SO THEY WERE USING THE
TRUCK AS A STASH?

25:34.030 --> 25:35.280
[ZIGGY] THAT WAS SID'S DEAL.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.740
