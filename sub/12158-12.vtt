00:06.974 --> 00:08.340
Morning, Baxters.
Morning.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.776
Hey, honey.
How did you sleep?
Sleep?

00:10.778 --> 00:12.544
Who can sleep with
this crushing national debt

00:12.546 --> 00:14.947
Hanging over our heads?

00:14.949 --> 00:17.950
Wow. So you're just becoming
the same person.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.785
It's great, isn't it?

00:19.787 --> 00:21.053
Yeah, not so great.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.055
Eve's been reposting
the vlogs dad does for the store

00:23.057 --> 00:25.324
On facebook,
and she's getting killed.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.558
Oh, man.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.360
This comment
is really inappropriate.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.795
Oh, wait.
I wrote that one.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.964
[ laughing ]

00:31.966 --> 00:34.133
"like"!

00:34.135 --> 00:35.968
I post dad's vlogs
so our side of the story

00:35.970 --> 00:36.968
Gets heard, you know?

00:36.970 --> 00:38.871
Like, the kids at my school
don't like hearing

00:38.873 --> 00:40.172
The ugly truth
about hillary clinton.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.573
Well, how did you get
to hillary?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.809
I thought your last vlog
was about kayaks?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.577
Kayaks to whitewater,
whitewater to travelgate,

00:45.579 --> 00:47.079
Travelgate to benghazi.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.382
W-why did I say
"benghazi"?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.317
Now I got an upset stomach,
thanks to you. What --

00:52.319 --> 00:54.920
Well,
my deepest apologies.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.589
I don't know what I was thinking
when I mentioned <i>kayaks.</i>

00:57.591 --> 01:01.894
Whoa. Eve, you officially have
more "dislikes" than friends.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.228
Yikes. There should be
a term for that.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.898
Oh, wait. I've a got it.
That's an "Eve Baxter."

01:05.900 --> 01:07.933
Honey, honey...
[ laughs ]

01:07.935 --> 01:09.735
"like."

01:09.737 --> 01:12.538
Well, bring it on. Trailblazer's
got to take some hits.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.940
Just like, uh, barry goldwater
paved the way for ronald reagan,

01:14.942 --> 01:16.942
Right, dad?
Kid's smart.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.110
She's not getting that

01:18.112 --> 01:20.012
From her appointed-for-life
public-school teachers.

01:20.014 --> 01:22.014
We really struck
a nerve, dad.

01:22.016 --> 01:25.017
Ooh -- "crawl back into
the primordial ooze,

01:25.019 --> 01:28.120
You mutant,
inbred hillbilly."

01:28.122 --> 01:29.755
Yeah, "primordial."

01:29.757 --> 01:32.791
We know that one's
not Mandy.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.593
You know what? I don't like
the sound of any of this.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.196
Relax, mom. Richie haden
is the sophomore-class president

01:37.198 --> 01:38.597
And he and his gang
of lefties

01:38.599 --> 01:42.034
Have whipped the school
into some pro-government frenzy.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.436
Well, why don't you just stop
reposting your father's vlogs?

01:44.438 --> 01:48.207
Thank god you weren't
at lexington and concord.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.308
We would have lost that war,

01:49.310 --> 01:52.111
And I'd be married
to a 238-year-old woman.

01:53.613 --> 01:57.216
"extremism in defense of liberty
is no vice."

01:57.218 --> 01:59.218
Boom.
Got to go. Bye.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.286
You know, there's not a lot
of sophomore girls

02:01.288 --> 02:03.455
That are quoting
barry goldwater these days.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.057
Yeah, well, they usually wait
till they're seniors --

02:05.059 --> 02:08.193
<i>Actual</i> seniors,
like in their 80s.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.830
You know what, honey?
I-I'm worried about Eve.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.133
I mean, she acts all tough
to try to impress you,

02:14.135 --> 02:16.301
But it's got to be hard
for a teenage girl

02:16.303 --> 02:19.304
To go through high school...
As you.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.141
Ooh! Hey, look at that.
She got a "like."

02:22.143 --> 02:26.145
It is from the local chapter
of the ted nugent fan club.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.679
The motor city madman?
Mm-hmm.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.482
You get past his music,
guy makes a lot of sense.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.984
I'm late.
I got to get going.

02:31.986 --> 02:32.985
No, you're not late.

02:32.987 --> 02:33.952
I'm late
if I want to get to work

02:33.954 --> 02:35.521
As early
as I usually get there.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.122
Oh.
You know what, honey?

02:37.124 --> 02:40.025
Hillary clinton
was a goldwater girl in 1964.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.729
So? Satan used to work for god.

<i>that red octagon means "stop."</i>

03:33.981 --> 03:35.180
Right, but I could see
the horizon,

03:35.182 --> 03:36.648
No other cars
in the intersection.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.017
I thought it was okay
to cruise through there

03:39.019 --> 03:41.019
At 2.5 miles an hour.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.021
I actually gunned you

03:50.931 --> 03:53.999
Kind of tucked
back in there.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.901
Shouldn't the criminals
be the one hiding?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.070
And yet you broke the law
in plain sight.

short at the end of the month,

That's the firefighters.

04:10.618 --> 04:14.853
Sure. The ladies love
the calendars.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.122
Like to see how tough
those guys would be

could shoot at them.

a firemen's calendar

04:37.978 --> 04:39.911
And put it up there
on the refrigerator.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.914
Right on.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.283
Of all the ways the
government dips into our pocket

04:44.285 --> 04:45.651
And steals our money,

04:45.653 --> 04:49.087
My least favorite is when
the police give us bogus tickets

04:49.089 --> 04:50.622
Just to fill up their quotas.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.091
Whoa, whoa, whoa. But I thought
you were mr. Law and order.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.126
Look, I love the police,

04:54.128 --> 04:56.061
But they go to the academy
to catch criminals,

04:56.063 --> 04:57.896
Not collect taxes.

the denver p.D.

Hey, low speed limits and
stop signs make streets safer.
I know.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.174
If we all went zero miles an
hour, there'd be zero accidents.

05:09.176 --> 05:12.144
G.D.P. Would be zero,
but we'd have zero accidents.

05:12.146 --> 05:16.948
So the d.P.D.
Is hurting g.D.P.?

05:16.950 --> 05:19.584

10 times fast.

Heads up! Uh, the cops set up a
speed trap in our neighborhood.

05:28.796 --> 05:32.798
He is hiding
behind the elm on cedar.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.035
Or...Is it
the cedar on elm? I...

05:38.037 --> 05:40.539
He's on cedar.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.174
And your dad can't stop
"birching" about it.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.878
For the sake of our family,
can you please stop doing that?

I can't believe I got pulled
over. It was kind of a thing.
What happened?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.116
Well, how --
well, how much was the ticket?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.918
No, no, no, he didn't give me
a ticket. I was just like this.

05:56.322 --> 05:59.925
And then I was like,
"oh, my god. Thank you so much."

06:01.227 --> 06:04.196
Just gave me a warning!
High five! [ laughs ]

06:04.198 --> 06:06.965

some of us have to pay.

Oh, come on. Honey,
let women have this one.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.805
There are millions of situations
where men have the upper hand.

today really got me thinking.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.019
Beauty is power, right?
Yeah?

06:29.021 --> 06:32.424
I mean, it can't power a car,
but it <i>can</i> get you a ride.

Like, maybe in
a private jet...To dubai.

06:37.997 --> 06:42.401
Well, "dubai."

06:42.403 --> 06:43.902
You know, this might not be
the best time,

06:43.904 --> 06:45.237
But you need
to write that check

06:45.239 --> 06:47.439
For her next semester
of college.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.075

to be writing is a sign

over there on cedar.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.345

06:53.347 --> 06:55.247
Then you could be like paul
revere, warning the villagers --

06:55.249 --> 06:58.049
One if by land,
two if by "cedar."

06:58.051 --> 07:01.953

07:01.955 --> 07:03.755
Dad, what are we
warning people about?

Mike: Tyranny, oppression,
government overreach --

07:05.926 --> 07:07.859
The democratic platform.

Uh, Eve, what, uh --
what happened to your lip?

07:10.564 --> 07:13.632
Oh, uh, I got into a
little scrap with richie haden.
What?!
What?!

07:13.634 --> 07:16.435
Yeah, um, I know,
as a joke, people like to say,

07:16.437 --> 07:19.070
"you should see the other guy,"
but, um...

07:19.072 --> 07:20.705
Seriously, you should
see the other guy.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.051
So,
you got in a fight?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.454
Well, richie haden was talking
smack about dad's vlogs...

07:35.456 --> 07:37.255
Give me this.
...And calling us rednecks.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.290
And he hit you?

07:38.292 --> 07:40.091
Well, he came at me,
and I used the aikido

07:40.093 --> 07:42.093
Self-defense techniques
dad taught me

07:42.095 --> 07:43.829
And put him
on the pavement.

07:43.831 --> 07:47.199
Honey, you know what?
We're very disappointed in you.

07:50.269 --> 07:53.738
And when she says "we," she
means her and richie's parents.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.341
And every other civilized
grown-up in denver.
What are you
talking about?

07:56.343 --> 07:57.943
She defended herself. That's
good. This is a great thing.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.110
And the best part
of this,

07:59.112 --> 08:01.847
I think I have
an idea for my next vlog.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.114
Oh, well, good.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.950
Standing up to tyranny.
Thank you.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.184
Can't wait to repost it.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.119
All right.
You all right?

08:08.121 --> 08:09.754
Call me insane,
but I don't think girls

08:09.756 --> 08:11.122
Should be brawling
in the streets.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.824
Kind of a double standard,
isn't it, mom?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.360
Wha-- no,
it's just a standard standard.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.496
Society understands that boys
will get in fights --

08:17.498 --> 08:18.997
It's a rite of passage --

08:18.999 --> 08:21.132
But a girl gets into it with
somebody who totally deserves it

08:21.134 --> 08:24.369
And everyone's all,
"bitches be crazy."

08:25.505 --> 08:28.306
I don't know.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.775
I mean, you've always taught us
to stand up for ourselves.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.110
Although, personally,

08:32.112 --> 08:33.678
There's nothing that I believe
in strongly enough

08:33.680 --> 08:35.747
To put the cash register
in jeopardy.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.150
"dubai."

08:39.152 --> 08:41.152
Honey?
What?

08:41.154 --> 08:43.355
You've raised three
very strong women.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.723
Thank you. I know.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.525
This is your fault.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.898
Mike, can you at least
pretend to be concerned

08:52.900 --> 08:54.332
That Eve got into a fight?

08:54.334 --> 08:57.335
Why? I'm proud of her, honey.
She defended herself.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.805
She won, and she clocked
a big-mouthed liberal.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.875
Let me enjoy this
for a minute.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.711
Well, was your dad happy
when you won your first fight?

09:07.880 --> 09:10.482
He was torn.

09:10.484 --> 09:13.051
'cause it was with <i>him.</i>

09:13.053 --> 09:15.253
Junior r.O.T.C.,
fighting?

09:15.255 --> 09:18.089
God, when I was 15, I-I just
wanted to be asked to the dance.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.091
Yeah, and movies
were a nickel.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.595
If she wandered off campus
with a guy,

09:23.597 --> 09:25.196
This is the best possible
version of that

09:25.198 --> 09:27.032
That I can think.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.067
I mean,
she's obviously too stubborn

09:29.069 --> 09:31.236
To stop reposting
your vlogs.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.873
You know, could you maybe
just...Tone them down a little?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.908
You want me to censor
what I say, honey?
No, no, I'm not --

09:36.910 --> 09:38.109
You want to muzzle me?

09:38.111 --> 09:40.045
I mean, what kind of lesson
does that teach the girls?

09:40.047 --> 09:42.581
If things get disagreeable,
you just modify your beliefs?

09:42.583 --> 09:45.016
No, I'm not saying
modify your beliefs.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.286
I'm saying
modulate your bellowing.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.021
[ chuckles ]

09:50.023 --> 09:51.856
[ sighs ] you know,
I don't ask for much.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.025
I mean, I got --
I got a shotgun rack in my den,

09:54.027 --> 09:56.227
A foosball table
in the guest room.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.696
And look a this --
look at my bedroom.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.197
It looks like
a cigar lounge.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.400
No, it doesn't.
It looks like a...

10:02.402 --> 10:04.002
It <i>does</i> look like
a cigar lounge.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.238
You know
what it could use?

10:07.240 --> 10:10.976
No, you are not putting
a humidor in here.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.577
If you're asking
for someone to compromise,

10:12.579 --> 10:13.778
You got to learn
to give a little.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.886
Hey, Mike.
Come here a minute, please.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.154
What's up?
Yeah, you know,

10:23.156 --> 10:26.591
You're getting a lot of page
views on your last vlog, Mike.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.593
It's comforting to know
that people who buy guns

10:28.595 --> 10:31.930
Also like angry rants
against the government.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.132
Well, they're gonna love
the next one --

10:34.134 --> 10:36.434
How to stand up to a tyrant.
[ sighs ]

10:36.436 --> 10:37.636
I like it,
but what does that

10:37.638 --> 10:38.970
Have to do
with fishing backpacks?

10:38.972 --> 10:42.607
The weight of the government
on your shoulders.
I know.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.676
I know. Got it.
Writes itself.
Yeah.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.078
Be honest with me --
am I taking this a bit too far?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.080
Vanessa thinks I should
tone it down a little bit.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.249
But doesn't she understand,
the more passionate you are,

10:51.251 --> 10:53.451
The more eyeballs we get,
the more product we move,

10:53.453 --> 10:56.855
The more chaffing dishes
you can buy her.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.289
This is really about Eve.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.692
You know, she reposts
some of these vlogs at school,

11:00.694 --> 11:02.293
And it looks like
she's getting in trouble.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.963
I know.
I follow her on facebook.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.998
I know.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.170
Yeah, the kids have been
pretty hard on her.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.606
Especially Mandy.

11:14.608 --> 11:17.008
Those kids are into
big government. No surprise.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.977
Teenagers are used to spending
other people's money.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.145
Mm-hmm.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.946
And what --
what do kids that age know?

11:21.948 --> 11:23.948
They're just parroting the stuff
that they learned at home,

11:23.950 --> 11:25.984
Just like Eve probably does
with you, so...
No, no, no, no, no.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.952
Eve's different.
She's an independent thinker.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.955
She comes
to her own conclusions...

11:30.957 --> 11:32.791
That everything I say
is right.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.793
I see. I see.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.529
Then you should tell her
to stop reposting your stuff.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.064
It's not gonna work.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.067
She's stubborn when it comes
to me being a genius.
Mm-hmm.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.368
Mike,
do you love your kid?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.904
This one, yeah.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.306
You have to tone down
your vlogs just a bit.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.508
We all make sacrifices
for our children.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.311
And what sacrifices
have you made for your kid?

11:53.313 --> 11:57.082
When gabriella was little,
I lost 130 pounds.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.083
Really?

11:58.085 --> 12:01.586
Yes, I divorced
her stepmother.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.026
Mike:
<i>Water-resistant nylon,</i>

12:08.028 --> 12:09.594
<i>Contoured yoke,</i>
<i>shoulder straps,</i>

12:09.596 --> 12:12.997
<i>Compatible with hydration</i>
<i>systems up to 60 ounces.</i>

12:12.999 --> 12:14.232
[ <i>exhales sharply</i> ]

12:14.234 --> 12:16.367
<i>So come on down to outdoor man</i>

12:16.369 --> 12:21.172
<i>And get your top-of-the-line</i>
<i>tactical fishing backpack.</i>

12:22.074 --> 12:24.442
How did you like
<i>that</i> vlog?

12:24.444 --> 12:26.211
That boring enough
for you?

12:26.213 --> 12:28.847
I could see you really
struggling to hold it in

12:28.849 --> 12:31.249
When you said
"made in china."

12:31.251 --> 12:32.917
You don't seem
too happy about it.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.052
What's the matter?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.887
Think I should have taken
more than 20% off of it?

12:35.889 --> 12:37.122
[ sighs ]

12:37.124 --> 12:40.258
That cop pulled me over today
and gave me a ticket.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.560
I told you
to stay off cedar, babe.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.964
No, he's moving around.
He was on hudson today.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.932
Hudson?
That's under construction.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.901
Double the fine.
Smart cop.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.202
Oh, I don't care
about the fine.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.871
<i>I</i> care about the fine.

12:52.873 --> 12:56.141
It's just [sighs] I've always
been able to, you know...

12:59.545 --> 13:01.980
Come on, honey.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.215
With your knockers,
you go with the hair?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.618
Nothing worked.
I tried everything.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.087
Honey, I --
am I losing it?

13:09.089 --> 13:13.124
Any cop gives this
a ticket doesn't like women.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.459
He was wearing
a wedding ring.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.261
It's 2014.
That could mean anything.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.296
And why are you checking out
whether he's married or not?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.564
Well...

13:19.566 --> 13:22.333
Wow! Whoa!
Hey, guys.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.270
Hey, hey. Where are you going
dressed like that?

13:25.272 --> 13:29.908
Oh, I have a paper due,
and I didn't quite write it.

13:29.910 --> 13:30.942
Mike: Well...

13:30.944 --> 13:33.144
Well, so, why --
why do you dress like that?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.146
I need the professor
to give me an extension,

13:35.148 --> 13:37.582
Or, if he really
likes the dress, an "a."

13:37.584 --> 13:39.751
Oh, god.
No, Mandy. Mandy, honey, no.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.986
You can't just skate
through life on your looks.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.922
'cause one day,
a cop's gonna give you a ticket.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.256
Hey.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.258
I know.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.628
But that's not gonna happen
for a long, long time.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.131
Well, not a "long,
long" time.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.299
You know...

13:54.301 --> 13:58.102
Long time.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.204
Hey, guys!

13:59.206 --> 14:01.506
You might want to come out here
and see something.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.776
[ chuckles ]

14:10.950 --> 14:13.151
Somebody standing
up to tyranny.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.086
That's what I'm talking about --
fight the power!

14:18.357 --> 14:19.824
Is that Eve?

14:19.826 --> 14:22.861
[ siren chirps ]

14:24.296 --> 14:27.265
She's not gonna get a warning
in that outfit.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.749
Mike: Hey. It's you.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.084
Feel free to come
to a complete stop

14:46.086 --> 14:48.987
Before you hit
the walkway here.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.823
Very funny.
You know this young lady?

14:51.825 --> 14:53.391
Well...
Yeah,
she might live here.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.461
You, uh...
Remember me?

14:58.163 --> 14:59.162
No.

14:59.164 --> 15:02.100
What? You just gave me
a ticket a half-hour ago.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.368
I see a lot of faces.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.070
Hey, Mandy.
Oh, hi, jay.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.843
Termites couldn't do
as much damage to my home

15:11.845 --> 15:13.678
As you're doing right now.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.014
Is my daughter in some kind
of trouble, officer?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.682
Yeah, because last time
I checked,

15:17.684 --> 15:19.083
This was a free country.
Okay, okay.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.285
By what authority

15:20.287 --> 15:22.787
Can you tell me
where I can hold my sign, jay?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.956
Colorado
traffic code 107 --

15:24.958 --> 15:27.592
"no person shall willfully fail
or refuse to comply

15:27.594 --> 15:29.093
"with any lawful order
or direction

"of any police officer invested
by law with authority to direct,

15:31.698 --> 15:35.033
Control,
or regulate traffic."

15:37.069 --> 15:40.305
You remembered all that
and not this?

15:43.642 --> 15:47.211
Okay, but does traffic code 107
trump the first amendment?
Eve. Ba-ba-ba-ba.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.279
Yes.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.148
But I'm letting you off
with a warning.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.784
Oh, well --
well, thank you, jay.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.952
Let's go.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.620
B-but wait.
You know, she had a point there.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.221
She was obstructing
justice.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.823
She was not
obstructing justice.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.058
Listen, officer.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.727
You know, barry goldwater
had a speech in front of --

16:02.729 --> 16:04.595
Barry goldwater?
Yeah, he had a speech.
It was a great --

16:04.597 --> 16:07.799
Outdoor man!
I knew I recognized you!

16:09.134 --> 16:11.102
I'd ask for your autograph,
but I got it yesterday.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.339
Yeah.
Oh. That was fun.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.741
Man, you really hate
the government.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.909
Well, "hate"
is a very strong word, off--

16:17.911 --> 16:19.277
Me, too.
What?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.112
As a rule,
people hate the government

16:21.114 --> 16:22.080
And people
hate their boss.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.583
Imagine if the government
was your boss.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.487
Wow. You --
you poor bastard.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.289
Love your vlogs.
Thanks a lot.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.657
A lot of us do.
Good.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.026
Uh, if there's ever anything
I can do for you, let me know.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.294
Uh, there is something
you could do.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.628
You could get rid
of that ticket you gave me

16:37.630 --> 16:39.597
For rolling through
that stop sign. How about that?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.132
I'm sorry.
That's already in the system.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.767
Yeah, sure it is.

16:42.769 --> 16:46.137
In the system.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.940
Yep, you don't want lunatics
driving around denver at,

16:48.942 --> 16:50.942
Uh, what --
4 miles an hour?

16:50.944 --> 16:56.047
But if there's ever anything
else I can do, give me a call.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.115
I'll do that.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.816
And try to stay
out of trouble.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.252
Why bother?
I have this.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.063
[ chuckling ] hey.
This is a cool sign.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.832
Warning the motorists
of denver -- I like it.

17:14.834 --> 17:15.832
Well, somebody
had to be paul revere.

17:15.834 --> 17:19.871
You know, dad, I was so hyped
to hear your vlog on tyranny,

17:19.873 --> 17:21.339
And you totally
bailed on me.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.840
If I wanted
to hear about sales,

17:22.842 --> 17:25.910
I'd just listen to Mandy
talking in her sleep.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.512
Well, Eve, honey,

17:27.514 --> 17:29.814
I did that to protect you from
getting in trouble at school.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.550
You've taught me how to
defend myself, dad, and I did.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.552
That's okay when it's stuff
that you really believe in,

17:34.554 --> 17:36.888
But I don't want you doing this
just to impress me.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.691
"extremism in defense of liberty
is no vice."

17:40.693 --> 17:44.028
You lifted that
from my vlog on fishing lures.

17:44.030 --> 17:48.399
And "moderation in pursuit
of justice is no virtue."

17:48.401 --> 17:49.567
I didn't say that.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.502
That's the rest
of goldwater's quote, dad.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.004
I pulled <i>that</i>
<i>from his acceptance speech</i>

17:53.006 --> 17:54.372
In the '64 convention.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.642
My god, you <i>are</i>
<i>the greatest kid in the world.</i>

17:59.211 --> 18:01.712
I appreciate that you're
into this political stuff.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.747
I really am.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.348
But sometimes
just raising your voice

18:04.350 --> 18:06.551
Isn't the best way
to get things done.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.086
So you want me
to tone it down.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.387
Or change your tone.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.022
I mean, if you really
want to get into this stuff,

18:11.024 --> 18:12.023
Get more involved.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.592
I mean,
why should richie haden

18:14.594 --> 18:17.695
Run for class president
unopposed?

18:17.697 --> 18:20.064
Maybe I will
run against him.
Yeah.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.265
Hmm.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.102
I mean, I've already
kicked his butt once.

18:25.237 --> 18:28.139
Campaign slogan
writes itself.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.109
You know what?
Thanks, dad.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.109
I'm gonna do it.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.412
And to paraphrase
the great grover norquist,

18:34.414 --> 18:36.214
"you can't drown
the government in a bathtub

18:36.216 --> 18:38.749
Unless you're willing to wrestle
around in the water with it."
yeah.

18:38.751 --> 18:42.120
Thanks, dad.
Richie haden, you're going down.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.322
I -- I...

18:44.324 --> 18:47.191
I really like that kid.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.730
Hi, there. Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man.

18:52.732 --> 18:56.100
America fought a war against
taxation without representation.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.935
And we won.

18:57.937 --> 19:01.606
We got taxation
<i>with</i> representation.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.008
What a booby prize
that turned out to be.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.309
So all this month,

19:05.311 --> 19:07.945
Outdoor man is fighting back
with our "no sales tax" sale.

19:07.947 --> 19:08.945
Taxes.

19:08.947 --> 19:12.450
Everywhere we turn,
another one jumps up to bite us.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.018
You drive over here
to outdoor man

19:14.020 --> 19:17.622
And you're paying 22 cents
a gallon in gasoline taxes.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.424
And in the gas tax,
there's another tax hiding

19:20.426 --> 19:22.627
Called the environmental
response surcharge.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.196
It's not a surcharge.
It's a tax.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.831
It's enough to make
you start smoking again.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.831
But if you do that,

19:27.833 --> 19:32.203
You'll be coughing up an extra
84 cents a pack in taxes.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.038
Wow. I'll need
a drink after that.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.039
I wouldn't do that.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.374
You can't even wet your whistle

19:36.376 --> 19:39.610
Without the government wetting
its beak at 60 cents a liter.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.012
They even changed it to liters

19:41.014 --> 19:43.014
So we don't know
what that means.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.616
We need to stand up against
the tyranny of high taxes

19:45.618 --> 19:48.019
And elect leaders
who value free markets,

19:48.021 --> 19:50.021
Free minds, and free people.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.990
And...

19:52.992 --> 19:55.193
Free period
after homeroom.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.561
Which is why outdoor man

19:56.563 --> 19:59.997
Is making its first-ever
political endorsement.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.800
Eve Baxter --
right for denver,

20:02.802 --> 20:04.368
Right for America,

20:04.370 --> 20:06.971
And right for
woodbridge high student council.

20:06.973 --> 20:11.509
Hello. I'm Eve Baxter,
and I approve this message.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.017
Hey, baby.
Hey.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.085
How was your day?

20:21.087 --> 20:23.754
Amazing.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.356
Well, tell me.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.558
What's an amazing day
in the world of a geologist?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.560
You find the rock
that killed goliath?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.995
[ both laugh ]

20:32.331 --> 20:35.533
No, no, work was actually
pretty dull,

20:35.535 --> 20:38.269
But something exciting
did happen on the way home.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.971
I got pulled over again.

20:42.107 --> 20:43.908
I'm sorry about that.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.111
No, no, no. It's okay.
Jay just gave me a warning.

20:47.113 --> 20:51.515
I'm just saying [sighs]
I still got it.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.384
Yeah, you still got it.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.987
Yes, I do!

20:59.925 --> 21:02.860
[ siren chirps ]

21:02.862 --> 21:04.495
[ siren chirps ]
