00:05.000 --> 00:06.708
- It's maddening, isn't it?
- Hello?

00:06.791 --> 00:08.458
The voice in your head.

00:08.541 --> 00:12.416
Relentless, forever unsatisfied.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.083
What's this?

00:15.541 --> 00:17.083
-Layla.

00:17.166 --> 00:19.875
-Oh, my God, you're alive.
-Yeah, all right.

00:19.958 --> 00:23.208
That's it? I've been texting
and calling you for months.

00:23.291 --> 00:27.083
My body wants to get up
and wander about, you know?

00:27.666 --> 00:31.041
And I don't even know about it
until I wake up wherever.

00:31.666 --> 00:32.791
Strange, innit?

00:33.125 --> 00:36.458
I strongly encourage you to return that.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.791
Here, take it.

00:37.875 --> 00:39.916
That was so strange. Sorry about...

00:40.291 --> 00:41.375
I will not ask again.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.916
Oh, my God!

00:45.541 --> 00:46.833
You're not gonna die.

00:48.708 --> 00:50.041
Let me save us.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.708
No, no, no.

02:08.833 --> 02:10.125
You there?

02:10.541 --> 02:11.625
Hmm?

02:13.375 --> 02:14.375
No?

02:16.208 --> 02:18.541
Yeah, didn't think so.

02:47.583 --> 02:48.583
J.B.: Bruv, hey.

02:49.541 --> 02:51.541
Oh, hey. Bro, it is proper mad in here.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.000
What happened? What is it?

02:53.083 --> 02:56.958
They're saying burst pipes,
but don't look like that to me.

02:58.416 --> 03:00.125
Has anyone seen the security footage?

03:00.875 --> 03:02.583
Well, yeah, I was about to.

03:03.541 --> 03:06.458
All right. I think
I should go with you, yeah?

03:08.041 --> 03:09.958
I may have some information about it.

03:11.583 --> 03:12.958
-All right, come on.
-Yeah.

03:13.041 --> 03:16.375
Do not tell Donna
that I let you into this arena.

03:16.458 --> 03:19.416
Bruv, listen, I must warn you.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.458
What you're about to see
is gonna melt your brain. Yeah?

03:23.541 --> 03:25.041
-Come on.
-Listen to me.

03:25.125 --> 03:29.833
It's like Area 51,
like MI6 bonkers, bruv. Yeah?

03:29.916 --> 03:32.083
-All right. All right, mate.
-You ready?

03:32.208 --> 03:33.208
Yeah.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.000
Roll the tape.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.416
Is that you, Scotty?

03:41.041 --> 03:44.541
Still Steven.
And yeah, that's me. Oh, yeah.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.458
Watch, here it comes.

03:47.916 --> 03:49.166
Are you cryin'?

03:50.375 --> 03:53.541
A bit. Yeah, a bit.
Watch, here it comes. Wait for it.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.250
Wait for it.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.625
How long am I waitin'?

03:59.166 --> 04:01.000
Different angle, yeah?
Different, different.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.375
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Wait for it, here it comes.

04:05.416 --> 04:06.875
No, no, no, wait.

04:06.958 --> 04:09.750
Why are you going in...
What are you doing, you donut?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.708
No, just a minute. Here it comes.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.458
Wait, wait. Now, just a minute.

04:14.541 --> 04:16.791
-You messed up the loos.
-Shh. I don't...

04:16.875 --> 04:18.166
-Mate!
-Oh, God.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.000
Larry in Maintenance
is gonna absolutely shoot you.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.916
I swear to God, there was
a dog chasing me, like a big hound, or...

04:25.000 --> 04:26.375
Hound of the Baskervilles, was it?

04:26.458 --> 04:29.250
-Egyptian jackal. It was a jackal.
-I've heard it all now.

04:31.458 --> 04:34.291
Oh, God. Oh, God.

04:35.791 --> 04:38.166
Fast forward till when I come out.
When I come out.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.750
Oh, yeah, why not, yeah.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.291
Let me do it.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.750
-Now, there. Have a look.
-Yeah, yeah...

04:49.250 --> 04:50.625
J.B.: It's still you, bruv.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.208
That's not me.

05:05.375 --> 05:09.041
I should tell you, the museum
has no wish to press charges.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.625
-Okay.
-But Mr. Grant,

05:12.958 --> 05:14.583
we've spoken to your colleagues.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.291
Yeah?

05:16.916 --> 05:19.958
It's all been a bit of a struggle
for you recently, hey?

05:22.125 --> 05:24.000
Yeah. A bit, a bit.

05:24.083 --> 05:28.791
This particular group of doctors
has a long-standing relationship with us.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.500
Doctors?

05:32.208 --> 05:33.208
Oh.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.166
They're wonderful.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.041
-Yeah?
-I could arrange an appointment.

05:41.916 --> 05:43.791
Okay. Yeah.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.041
It looks...
It actually looks quite posh.

05:47.916 --> 05:50.416
Looks like they're
very good listeners, right?

05:50.541 --> 05:51.625
They really are.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.791
I know this is classic HR to say, but...

05:57.500 --> 05:58.583
But you're not alone.

06:00.541 --> 06:02.916
Yeah. That's, like,
part of the problem, innit?

06:04.833 --> 06:08.083
Before you leave us,
I'm sorry for the protocol of it, but...

06:08.291 --> 06:10.375
Any museum property on your person?

06:10.458 --> 06:13.916
No, I haven't nicked anything.
I swear. I...

06:20.125 --> 06:21.125
No, nothing.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.416
Uh...

06:28.833 --> 06:29.916
Yeah.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.708
Well, that's it. I got the sack.

06:44.791 --> 06:47.750
I don't blame 'em. I'm a vandal.
I should've been arrested.

06:51.791 --> 06:55.458
I did find things hidden in my flat.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.875
I swear. I'm not joking.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.833
That's worth exploring, isn't it?

07:02.291 --> 07:04.416
Like, if I could find that storage locker,

07:04.500 --> 07:09.000
that might be my one chance
to prove to myself that I'm not mad.

07:10.791 --> 07:13.666
Oh, mate, thank you. Thanks. Cheers.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.416
-Hiya.
-Hey.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.666
-You all right?
-Yeah.

07:25.750 --> 07:29.791
Yeah. Um, look, man, this is, like,
the fifth branch I've been to.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.750
I'm looking for my storage locker.
It's under "Steven Grant."

07:32.833 --> 07:35.958
If it's not under Steven Grant,
it might be under "Marc."

07:36.041 --> 07:39.250
I don't have a surname, just Marc.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.000
Would you have a look for me,
if that's all right?

07:42.166 --> 07:46.458
-I know it sounds...

07:47.333 --> 07:48.541
I never forget a face.

07:52.666 --> 07:53.666
All right.

09:14.666 --> 09:15.750
Oh, my God.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.250
"Marc Spector."

09:50.208 --> 09:51.416
No way.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.541
It's real. It's totally real.

10:03.625 --> 10:04.625
Whoa.

10:09.916 --> 10:13.625
I'd say you are a compass,
but you're not pointing north.

10:15.541 --> 10:18.791
Steven, I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

10:18.875 --> 10:19.875
Marc?

10:20.916 --> 10:22.708
There he is. Here he comes.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.833
Hello, man in the mirror.
I was wondering if you'd pop up again.

10:26.916 --> 10:28.791
-I know you're scared.
-A bit, yeah.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.333
I know you're confused.
You weren't supposed to see any of this.

10:31.416 --> 10:33.208
No? Well, bit late for that, innit?

10:33.291 --> 10:37.500
So, what? Am I, like, meant to be some
sort of mad secret agent or something?

10:37.583 --> 10:39.291
It's a little more complicated than that.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.708
More complicated? What? Am I possessed?

10:41.791 --> 10:45.791
-Are you, like, a demon? Or...
-You're in danger, and I can save us,

10:46.458 --> 10:47.833
just like I did last night.

10:47.916 --> 10:51.375
But I can't have you interfering
in what I have left to do.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.083
So, this is what's gonna happen.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.583
You're gonna go lay down
on that cot back there.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.791
-You're gonna take a nice nap.
-Are you joking?

10:59.875 --> 11:02.750
Sleep... I'm never gonna
go to sleep again. You hear me?

11:03.833 --> 11:07.125
Look, I don't care
how bloody handsome you are.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.000
Tell me what it is you are. What are you?

11:11.708 --> 11:14.125
-You sure you want to know?
-Yes, bloody... Yes.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.208
I serve Khonshu. I'm his Avatar.

11:18.958 --> 11:21.750
Which means you are, too. Sort of.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.833
We protect the vulnerable

11:25.916 --> 11:29.500
and deliver Khonshu's justice
to those who hurt them.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.083
-Khonshu?
-Yeah.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.166
The Egyptian god of the moon?

11:35.291 --> 11:38.000
Oh, my God, that's
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.083
I eat one piece of steak, and then, bam,
I go bonkers.

11:42.166 --> 11:45.083
Oh, God. I'm having a panic attack.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.833
-I made a deal with Khonshu.
-I need to go to hospital.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.083
That deal is contingent
on you not interfering, Steven.

11:53.041 --> 11:56.833
Now, give me the body. Let me finish this,
and you'll never hear from me again.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.833
You want my body? Right, yeah.

11:59.916 --> 12:04.750
Marc, how about this for a deal? I'm gonna
take this bag full of illegal shit, yeah?

12:04.833 --> 12:07.083
And I'm gonna go
straight to the authorities.

12:07.166 --> 12:10.208
And they're gonna put me away
so I don't hurt anyone else.

12:10.291 --> 12:14.166
And hopefully, NHS will
fill me with enough pills

12:14.250 --> 12:16.125
so that you get out of my head!

12:34.583 --> 12:36.375
Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.541
Give it back, you fool.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.166
Marc? Where have you been?

13:31.958 --> 13:33.000
Layla?

13:33.416 --> 13:37.291
What the hell is going on? Is this
Steven the latest fake identity for you?

13:37.375 --> 13:40.708
I figured you were using a coded message
when we spoke on the phone.

13:40.791 --> 13:41.875
How did you find me?

13:41.958 --> 13:43.833
How'd you think?
I tracked your phone.

13:43.916 --> 13:46.625
I thought you wanted me
to do that when you turned it on.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.000
Right. Yeah.

13:48.083 --> 13:52.041
You know, you really could have
given me any sign that you were alive.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.833
I thought that you were in danger,
or kidnapped again.

13:54.916 --> 13:57.125
I just kept thinking,
"He's got the suit. He's fine."

13:57.208 --> 14:00.500
Then, I thought, "Well, what if he gets
ambushed when he's not wearing it?"

14:00.583 --> 14:02.291
And "What if he doesn't have it?" And...

14:02.375 --> 14:05.333
-Stop clasping my shoulder like that.
-I don't know where to hold.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.333
Feels like riding
with a Victorian duchess.

14:07.416 --> 14:08.500
Where do I hang on?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.083
Do you see the spiral you put me through?

14:19.791 --> 14:21.875
It's not okay, yeah? I'm still your wife.

14:23.708 --> 14:27.458
By the way, this would be a great time
for you to say something. Anything.

14:27.541 --> 14:30.541
-Just in case it's not clear.
-Sorry, sorry... Did you say wife?

14:31.250 --> 14:33.125
My... Are we married?

14:33.208 --> 14:35.750
Look, I'm pretty sure
we lost whoever was chasing you.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.166
-Just drop the act.
-It's not an act. I...

14:38.250 --> 14:41.708
-Stop with the accent, please.
-This is how I talk.

14:42.083 --> 14:45.625
-Okay. Get off the bike.
-No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Please.

14:45.708 --> 14:49.125
Please, I will tell you everything,
just get me to my flat, yeah?

14:50.458 --> 14:51.541
Just get me home.

15:00.916 --> 15:01.916
All right.

15:18.416 --> 15:19.666
She shouldn't be here.

15:20.916 --> 15:23.916
Get her out of here, Steven.
You're way out of your depth.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.333
I just want my life back.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.041
Yeah, I'm getting that.

15:30.125 --> 15:34.875
No. Sorry, I wasn't talking to you,
just talking to myself. Sort of.

15:34.958 --> 15:39.291
-Uh, this is your flat, Marc?
-Um, I'm Steven.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.958
Are you living here with someone else?

15:42.250 --> 15:43.875
No, no, no.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.416
No, this is my mum's flat.

15:47.625 --> 15:50.583
Okay, so you guys are talking again?

15:53.500 --> 15:54.500
Mmm-hmm.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.833
Marceline Desbordes-Valmore?

16:01.083 --> 16:02.166
Yep.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.125
Oui, oui.

16:17.791 --> 16:19.291
She's my favorite poet.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.083
Um, no, she's my favorite.

16:24.791 --> 16:26.208
That's mental.

16:29.791 --> 16:32.166
So, you're learning
French and hieroglyphics?

16:32.750 --> 16:36.208
Yeah, well...
That's not that impressive, really.

16:36.666 --> 16:38.875
It's not like hieroglyphs
are a whole language.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.666
-It's more like a...
-Like an alphabet.

16:42.916 --> 16:45.041
Yeah, and... Well, you still have to know

16:46.000 --> 16:47.875
-ancient Egyptian to read it.
-Sure.

16:48.125 --> 16:51.791
-For example, like this one here, right?
-Funeral rites.

16:54.375 --> 16:57.833
Well, someone knows
their unilaterals. You.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.500
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

17:02.875 --> 17:07.833
-Sorry, I don't mean that in a creepy way.
-No, I'm sorry. I'm not buying this, Marc.

17:07.916 --> 17:09.916
Use whatever accent you want. Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.250
Let's just get this over with. You sent
these papers but you never signed them.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.416
Did I? Uh...

17:16.583 --> 17:19.458
This is what you wanted.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.083
Have a look here.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.375
After everything, you told me
that we needed to move on.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.583
All right. Divo... Divorce?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.500
Yeah, we doing this or not?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.375
I would never divorce you.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.291
What are you doing?

17:42.916 --> 17:46.666
Look, you seem absolutely lovely.

17:47.041 --> 17:52.125
This Marc, on the other hand,
is a right twit. Yeah?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.708
I don't know how to explain
what's been happening.

17:56.791 --> 17:58.875
-Steven.
-I don't expect you to believe me.

17:58.958 --> 18:02.041
-Steven, listen to me.
-I honestly don't really believe myself.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.791
-All I can do is try to...
-You're making a mistake.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.791
-...try to show you what I found.
-Steve...

18:06.875 --> 18:10.416
-I found this bag in the storage locker.
-Steven, don't... Listen to me.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.791
-Inside of it is all sorts...
-Stop what you're doing right now.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.000
-...of things.
-Don't show her what's in the bag.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.333
-Most interestingly...
-You're gonna get her killed. You hear me?

18:20.958 --> 18:23.375
Most interestingly is what?

18:23.458 --> 18:26.666
You show her that scarab, you're
responsible when they come after her.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.708
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

18:28.958 --> 18:30.208
Nothing. Never mind.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.458
-What's in there?
-Nothing... Wait, wait...

18:33.791 --> 18:34.875
Bloody hell.

18:38.208 --> 18:42.791
The scarab pointing to Ammit's ushabti?
What we fought side by side for.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.666
-No...
-This whole one-man show is just what?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.750
So that you can keep it for yourself?

18:47.833 --> 18:49.875
-No. I swear...
-After all we've been...

18:49.958 --> 18:54.041
Just stop! I'm supposed to believe
anything you say with this shoved in

18:54.125 --> 18:56.916
-what, a gym bag?
-Take it. Take it, you can have it.

18:57.666 --> 19:02.041
Take it. I don't want it. I don't want it.
I swear. Have it.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.875
I am not Marc Spector.

19:08.083 --> 19:12.458
I'm Steven Grant. I work in a gift shop.
Well, I used to work in a gift shop.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.250
And I think I'm in real danger,

19:16.333 --> 19:19.833
and I think maybe that you might be
the only person that can help me.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.333
Please.

19:24.041 --> 19:28.083
You really don't remember
why we've been looking for this?

19:29.041 --> 19:31.041
Our adventures.

19:32.916 --> 19:34.958
Or our life together?

19:36.791 --> 19:38.166
Oh, God, I wish I could.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.666
Steven Grant, can we have a word?

19:42.750 --> 19:45.458
See? Oh, God, they've come for me.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.666
-Why?
-I vandalized the toilet.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.458
Yeah, just a minute.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.541
Steven Grant?

19:55.875 --> 19:58.125
-Yeah?
-DC Fitzgerald and DC Kennedy here.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.666
Yeah, one second.

20:02.916 --> 20:05.041
Hello, officers.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.583
Steven Grant?

20:08.083 --> 20:11.375
I think so, yeah. I mean, yep, yes.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.458
That's me, 100% Steven Grant.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.958
Sorry, I was just havin' a bit of a day.

20:19.833 --> 20:21.375
Mind if we come in, Mr. Grant?

20:21.458 --> 20:24.791
-Oh, um, actually, right now isn't...
-Appreciate it.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.250
Anyone else here with you?

20:27.375 --> 20:31.125
Uh, here with me? No, just me and my fish.

20:31.208 --> 20:32.291
Yeah.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.791
So, um...

20:38.500 --> 20:39.625
Yeah.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.833
Is this about the toilet?

20:42.333 --> 20:46.250
'Cause it's been dealt with.
Yeah. I've been sacked.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.208
And, uh, yeah, that's...

20:50.416 --> 20:52.125
I have a sleeping disorder.

20:53.125 --> 20:57.083
And, yeah, well, the museum said
that they wouldn't press charges

20:57.166 --> 21:01.541
as long as, uh... As long
as I do it in installments. That, uh...

21:03.500 --> 21:04.958
They said that I could.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.458
-What's this?
-It's a paperweight.

21:08.625 --> 21:11.625
-Where'd you get it?
-Paperweight shop.

21:20.958 --> 21:23.291
You're in possession
of a stolen item.

21:23.375 --> 21:24.958
Oh. Yeah, I...

21:26.041 --> 21:30.875
No. I don't have it.
I don't. No, it's not here.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.083
"Marc Spector"?

21:37.666 --> 21:40.166
-That's not mine.
-Funny that.

21:41.916 --> 21:43.625
Fella looks just like you.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.250
Fake passport and a thief.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.416
Tsk, tsk.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.208
I think you best come with us, son.

21:59.333 --> 22:02.958
Wow. Lookie, lookie.
Guess what we've got here, Billy.

22:03.458 --> 22:04.791
Go on, tell me.

22:04.875 --> 22:08.166
We've only got ourselves
a full-blown, international fugitive.

22:08.250 --> 22:11.375
It's not... It's a mistake. It's not me.

22:11.458 --> 22:15.541
Marc Spector was part of a team of
mercenaries that hit a dig site in Egypt.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.416
Here's what they did
to the archaeologists.

22:21.583 --> 22:26.083
Zip-tied and shot
in the back of the head, execution-style.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.125
That's dark, man.

22:31.958 --> 22:34.833
No, no, no. I didn't do that.
That's not me.

22:34.916 --> 22:36.958
Of course you didn't, Steven.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.250
I thought we were
going to the police station.

23:00.416 --> 23:02.250
Now, why would you think that?

23:03.958 --> 23:06.000
Sit tight, yeah?

23:10.375 --> 23:11.791
No.

23:20.208 --> 23:23.416
Hello. Hello! Excuse me,
could you help me?

23:23.500 --> 23:25.958
Help, please. I've been kidnapped...

23:28.125 --> 23:29.375
She's one, too.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.500
Oh, my God.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.625
What?

23:39.708 --> 23:43.125
You don't need to fight me, Steven.
Surrender control.

23:43.208 --> 23:48.125
No. No, I saw what you did
to those people.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.875
-It's not what you think.
-I'm...

23:52.958 --> 23:57.333
I am never giving you control again.

23:57.625 --> 23:59.541
Ever. Do you hear me?

24:00.666 --> 24:03.916
I hear you loud and clear,
Steven Grant of the gift shop.

24:11.666 --> 24:13.000
Oh, God.

24:13.666 --> 24:17.458
I'm sorry for the wait.
We just needed a chance to

24:17.541 --> 24:20.541
better understand your situation.
Do you have the keys?

24:21.000 --> 24:24.333
Let's get you out of those cuffs.
There you go.

24:24.416 --> 24:25.666
Thank you both.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.500
-Aren't they terrific?
-Yeah, they're lovely.

24:29.583 --> 24:30.625
All right.

24:31.083 --> 24:34.750
Well, no wonder your scales don't balance.

24:34.833 --> 24:39.083
It must be very difficult having
all those voices inside one head.

24:39.166 --> 24:44.083
Steven Grant, Marc Spector, Khonshu.

24:45.416 --> 24:50.416
I'm curious, do you think that
Khonshu chose you as his Avatar

24:50.500 --> 24:54.333
because your mind would be so easy
to break or because it was broken already?

24:56.208 --> 24:59.250
No, I'm not broken.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.000
Just need some help, maybe.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.708
That's right.
That's why I'm here, to help.

25:05.125 --> 25:07.875
Okay, what is it?
Do you see him? You see him right now?

25:07.958 --> 25:10.458
-That's a privilege I no longer have.
-Kill him!

25:10.541 --> 25:13.541
What's he saying, huh?
Is he telling you to kill me?

25:14.166 --> 25:17.208
-Break his windpipe!
-Yeah.

25:17.708 --> 25:20.833
Well, just remember,
you don't have to do everything he asks.

25:21.708 --> 25:24.708
So, before you get excited
and put on the cape,

25:24.791 --> 25:27.500
I'd love to take this opportunity
to show you around.

25:30.416 --> 25:35.541
It's all right, it's all right. That's all
he can do without your help. Come.

25:36.208 --> 25:40.375
See, this neighborhood used to have
the highest crime rate in all the city.

25:40.708 --> 25:43.041
There was so much suffering,
so much pain...

25:43.125 --> 25:46.166
-Good evening. Good evening, everyone.

25:46.250 --> 25:47.916
It was truly heartbreaking.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.666
Now people don't lock
their doors at night. They feel safe.

25:52.875 --> 25:56.125
Oh, Chase, are those the tomatoes?

25:57.958 --> 26:02.000
You have a green thumb. Beautiful.
Thank you.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.583
But you don't want to tell anyone, no.

26:04.666 --> 26:06.416
People don't want to hear good news.

26:06.500 --> 26:09.125
They'd rather cling to their fear,
cling to their pain.

26:10.291 --> 26:12.375
-Goat...
-What? Yes.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.125
Ha-ha.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.958
-You all speak Chinese?
-Ah, Mandarin.

26:29.041 --> 26:31.208
We all aspire to learn three languages.

26:31.291 --> 26:33.875
So, we teach each other.
We share our knowledge.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.083
Wow.

26:44.541 --> 26:45.833
You hungry?

26:47.041 --> 26:48.625
The food's free.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.666
-You're a vegan, right?
-Yeah.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.250
Yeah, so am I.

26:54.625 --> 26:57.708
You might wanna try the lentil soup.
I made it this morning.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.416
It's Victor's recipe.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.125
Gracias, Victor.

27:02.750 --> 27:07.416
He's from the Yucatan.
He's... No, he's very funny.

27:08.166 --> 27:09.958
Here.

27:10.041 --> 27:14.000
I know being on the right side of things
is important to you.

27:14.583 --> 27:18.750
Khonshu always tries to ensnare
those with a strong moral conscience.

27:18.833 --> 27:20.500
You have no conscience.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.041
You don't have to listen to him.

27:26.708 --> 27:30.375
He often throws temper tantrums,
like a two-year-old.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.333
None of the gods respect him.

27:35.166 --> 27:37.250
Perhaps that's why he's banished.

27:37.333 --> 27:41.041
I only punish those
who have already done harm.

27:41.125 --> 27:43.708
I am real justice!

27:45.541 --> 27:49.041
What's he saying now? "I am real justice"?

27:53.666 --> 27:55.375
Can you hear him?

27:56.166 --> 27:59.875
Not anymore. I was his former Avatar.

28:00.875 --> 28:05.208
Before you. I was the fist of vengeance.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.375
-Mmm.
-I'm not the fist of anything.

28:08.458 --> 28:11.833
That's the little American man living
inside of me.

28:11.916 --> 28:13.708
And that's, uh, that's Marc?

28:15.625 --> 28:18.916
Soup's... Yeah, it's very good.
It's ace. Yeah, it's lovely.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.125
Khonshu punishes those
who have already walked an evil path.

28:23.208 --> 28:25.916
His retribution comes too late.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.708
By the time his fist of vengeance arrives,

28:30.375 --> 28:32.208
people have already suffered.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.291
Ammit knows this too well.

28:36.375 --> 28:38.625
She tears evil up from the root,

28:38.708 --> 28:41.125
casting her judgment
before any evil's done.

28:41.958 --> 28:44.625
-That's why we must resurrect her.
-Right.

28:44.708 --> 28:47.416
But... Isn't that a bit dodgy?

28:47.500 --> 28:51.250
Like, trusting the judgment
of a weird crocodile lady?

28:51.583 --> 28:54.166
You don't need to doubt her judgment.

28:54.291 --> 28:58.875
Ammit will light the path to good
by eradicating the choice of evil,

28:58.958 --> 29:03.333
which brings us to the scarab.

29:07.583 --> 29:12.125
That scarab functions
as a kind of compass,

29:12.208 --> 29:14.333
leading us to Ammit's tomb.

29:15.250 --> 29:20.166
She's out there, waiting,
longing to be freed.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.333
Hi.

29:21.416 --> 29:26.250
While the cruel masses
deserve to face her judgment.

29:27.416 --> 29:29.291
And in the wake of their screams,

29:30.041 --> 29:32.333
evil eradicated.

29:33.416 --> 29:34.916
Steven,

29:35.708 --> 29:37.666
to exist at that moment?

29:39.833 --> 29:41.000
Heaven on Earth.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.250
So, the scarab.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.750
-Oh, I don't have it.
-No?

29:47.833 --> 29:49.083
Honestly, I don't have it.

29:49.791 --> 29:52.041
Well, maybe you know someone who does?

29:53.583 --> 29:56.000
-Maybe Marc?
-Don't you do it.

29:56.083 --> 29:59.916
Don't you say her name.
Do not give Layla up.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.500
Just give me the body.

30:02.375 --> 30:05.208
-No, I don't.
-May I speak with Marc?

30:05.708 --> 30:06.875
Um, uh...

30:06.958 --> 30:09.916
Marc,
what has Khonshu promised you?

30:10.000 --> 30:13.666
That this is your last mission?
Then you'll be free?

30:13.750 --> 30:18.333
Trust me when
I tell you Khonshu is a liar.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.875
There's always one last thing.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.583
Sorry. If Ammit judges people pre-evil,
like, before the fact,

30:29.708 --> 30:32.166
then, isn't she judging
an innocent person?

30:32.250 --> 30:35.625
I mean, a thought can't be evil, can it?

30:35.708 --> 30:38.458
I think about killing
my boss all the time,

30:38.541 --> 30:41.000
-but I wouldn't actually do it.
-Steven...

30:41.083 --> 30:45.541
What about a child? Would she kill a child
for something they might do in 30 years?

30:46.875 --> 30:48.541
I'm glad you mentioned that.

30:50.333 --> 30:54.750
Sometimes, the cure is
a little taste of the disease.

30:55.541 --> 30:59.708
The difference between medicine
and poison sometimes is only dosage.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.333
Consider a diseased limb.

31:03.666 --> 31:06.583
Amputation, horrific and grotesque,

31:07.291 --> 31:10.375
is necessary for the larger health.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.833
But the child is not a diseased limb.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.083
Sorry, is that... Is that what...

31:18.416 --> 31:21.708
You're all into that, like,
killing children and that?

31:22.083 --> 31:23.875
Maybe that's just me, but that's...

31:23.958 --> 31:27.958
I kind of draw a line there
at child murder.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.750
Do you know what this is?

31:37.958 --> 31:41.208
-Yep. It's a cane, yeah.
-This is...

31:43.000 --> 31:46.583
Ammit's gift to her first Avatar.

31:47.541 --> 31:48.625
All right.

31:50.666 --> 31:52.041
It contains in it

31:53.291 --> 31:56.541
a tiny sliver of her power.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.916
I don't wanna use it.

32:00.833 --> 32:02.958
-I don't.
-Then don't.

32:04.625 --> 32:07.000
-I can't help you.
-Yes, you can.

32:07.083 --> 32:11.166
I need to know, where is the scarab?

32:13.750 --> 32:15.166
Where is the scarab?

32:16.375 --> 32:19.791
-Where is the scarab?
-No.

32:19.875 --> 32:22.458
- Where's the scarab?
- I have it.

32:30.625 --> 32:35.583
You couldn't possibly understand
the value of what you're holding.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.000
Let me have that, I'll keep it safe.

32:39.083 --> 32:43.958
There is no deal in this, Marc.
Fix this. Fix this!

32:45.250 --> 32:46.625
Summon the suit.

32:47.541 --> 32:49.041
Sorry, what?

32:51.208 --> 32:52.333
Summon the suit.

32:52.416 --> 32:54.875
-"Summon the soup"? What are you saying?
-The suit. Summon it.

32:54.958 --> 32:56.583
- The suit?
- And keep this safe.

32:57.333 --> 32:59.125
-So be it.
-Let's go, let's go.

33:00.083 --> 33:01.125
Get off, get off her!

33:09.666 --> 33:11.375
-Steven!

33:28.958 --> 33:30.041
That was awesome.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.416
Here. Bolt the door.

33:53.666 --> 33:54.875
Oh, my God.

33:56.458 --> 33:58.833
I'm going to die
in an evil magician's man cave.

33:58.916 --> 34:02.083
-No. Hey. Listen to me. Listen to me.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.458
Your name is Marc. There's a suit.

34:04.541 --> 34:08.041
-I've seen you use it. You bring it out.
-No.

34:08.125 --> 34:10.583
-Where are you? We need you to fight.
-Let me in, Steven!

34:10.666 --> 34:13.750
-No. I can't. Stop, please, both of you.
-Let me in. There's no more time.

34:13.833 --> 34:17.083
-Please, stop.
-Listen to me. Your name is Marc.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.000
Bring it out!

34:21.083 --> 34:23.291
Let me in. Let me in.

34:24.416 --> 34:25.750
Let me in, Steven.

34:25.833 --> 34:28.958
Where the hell are you? You need to fight!

34:29.041 --> 34:31.375
Please stop.
Leave me alone, both of you!

34:31.458 --> 34:32.500
Hey!

34:33.541 --> 34:35.500
You can do this, I promise.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.041
Steven...

34:40.666 --> 34:43.041
I can't. I can't.

34:43.125 --> 34:46.375
-I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do it.

34:46.458 --> 34:49.000
It's all right. Okay.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.625
-We'll just find another way.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.291
Come on. Come on, let's go.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.375
Jackal. Jackal. Jackal!

35:02.000 --> 35:03.166
What jackal?

35:03.666 --> 35:05.625
Jackal. Jackal...

35:08.958 --> 35:10.458
Summon the suit!

35:10.541 --> 35:11.541
Suit!

35:27.041 --> 35:28.791
That should have been much worse.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.333
Oy, Steven,
what the hell are we wearing?

35:33.041 --> 35:34.916
I don't know.
She said I needed a suit.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.916
Yeah, the ceremonial armor from Khonshu's
temple, not psycho Colonel Sanders.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.875
Well, I don't know how
any of this shit works, man. I...

35:42.333 --> 35:44.333
Well, think I do look sharp, though.

35:44.416 --> 35:47.416
- All right, where is the scarab?
- Scarab... Oh, um...

35:49.916 --> 35:52.333
What's this?
What are these little poles for?

35:54.208 --> 35:55.875
Pretty cool, actually.

35:57.041 --> 35:58.791
Ha. I like this.

36:19.083 --> 36:21.458
You look different.

36:29.416 --> 36:31.250
-Stay away from me!
-Wait, wh...

37:24.041 --> 37:26.916
Give me control, Steven.
You can't handle this.

37:28.750 --> 37:31.875
I think I can.
Get away from her, you.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.875
Yeah, I see you, you plug-ugly coyote.

37:36.083 --> 37:39.875
You're in the wrong ends, mate.
You're in my yard now.

37:40.083 --> 37:44.000
Yeah. Come on. Come on.
That's right. Come on.

37:45.291 --> 37:47.333
Ooh, lookie here. Lookie here.

37:48.250 --> 37:52.333
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,
my name is Steven with a V.

37:53.791 --> 37:57.125
Oh, my God. Here you come, come on!

37:58.500 --> 37:59.625
What?

38:02.375 --> 38:05.333
I did it! You got planted!

38:05.416 --> 38:07.458
Layla, Layla! Did you see that?

38:13.916 --> 38:16.041
Do you reckon he's havin' a seizure?

38:16.125 --> 38:19.041
Nah, look at him.
He's just a fancy drunk.

38:21.208 --> 38:23.291
-Oh!

38:46.875 --> 38:49.166
That was a hell of a punch back there.

38:50.208 --> 38:51.750
Look around.

38:52.750 --> 38:55.333
Someone's gonna get hurt
if you don't let me help.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.833
All right. Do it. Take control. For now.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.666
Get it out of here.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.750
Come on. Come on.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.416
That's it. Just a little further.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.000
Gotcha!

40:37.083 --> 40:39.500
No, no. Where is it? Where is it?

40:39.875 --> 40:40.875
Shit!

40:41.875 --> 40:43.291
Shit!

40:51.291 --> 40:53.208
I'm sorry, but that belongs to me.

40:54.208 --> 40:57.375
I can offer you food, clothing,

40:57.625 --> 41:00.666
but I am unable
to offer you this. Thank you.

41:02.833 --> 41:05.583
I wish you could live
to see the world we make.

41:37.833 --> 41:39.458
So, this is what it's like?

41:40.916 --> 41:42.333
Being on the inside?

41:46.208 --> 41:47.208
Yeah.

41:49.125 --> 41:51.583
-It's horrible.
-It's all right. You're all right.

41:55.791 --> 41:58.916
-I feel like I can scarcely move.
-It's all right, just breathe through it.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.166
It gets easier.

42:01.125 --> 42:02.958
How long have you been doing this?

42:06.250 --> 42:09.125
I don't know. It's... A long time.

42:09.208 --> 42:10.791
-I don't like it.
-Long time.

42:11.333 --> 42:14.416
I don't want it. Can I have my body back?

42:14.500 --> 42:17.000
-I can't do that right now, Steven.
-Please.

42:17.583 --> 42:18.791
I'm taking it back.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.583
-Sorry.

42:26.666 --> 42:29.666
We've always managed to keep a wall
between us, but something's changed.

42:30.541 --> 42:33.291
The one who controls the body
has become stronger.

42:33.833 --> 42:36.291
The reflections help,
but most of the time,

42:36.375 --> 42:39.125
it'll take all your willpower
just to be a fly on the wall.

42:39.208 --> 42:43.208
You can't do this, keeping me
trapped in here. You have no right.

42:44.166 --> 42:45.458
My whole life...

42:45.916 --> 42:49.208
I can't go on a bloody date.
I can barely keep a goldfish alive.

42:49.291 --> 42:52.416
I lost my job. It's been you.
It's always been you,

42:53.041 --> 42:55.916
eating away at parts of my life
like a parasite.

42:56.375 --> 42:59.791
Look, when I am done,
when I have repaid my debt,

42:59.875 --> 43:03.250
I swear to you, you will never
see me or hear from me again.

43:03.708 --> 43:07.750
I promise you. We wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for Khonshu. And my...

43:09.458 --> 43:12.250
servitude is the price that I pay.

43:13.208 --> 43:16.291
-What kind of servitude?
-The kind that leaves me covered in blood.

43:16.375 --> 43:18.916
Yeah, well, that blood is on my hands.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.750
You ruin people's lives.
Everything you touch, you ruin.

43:21.833 --> 43:25.083
You hurt people, you abandoned
your wife. You left her stranded.

43:25.166 --> 43:28.166
I did not. I am protecting her.
You don't know what you're talking about.

43:28.250 --> 43:30.750
-Yes, you did. I saw.
-Khonshu has his eyes on her.

43:30.833 --> 43:33.833
He wants her as my replacement.
I'm never gonna let that happen.

43:33.916 --> 43:36.333
You're a liar. I don't believe you.
I don't trust you.

43:36.416 --> 43:38.625
-You hurt people.
-I'm never letting him near her.

43:38.708 --> 43:40.875
-Just shut up!
-I won't let you hurt anyone again.

43:40.958 --> 43:44.333
I will never give you
a moment of peace, I promise.

43:44.416 --> 43:46.166
-Shut up!

43:46.250 --> 43:50.333
You shut up! Shut up!

44:08.541 --> 44:11.375
You swore
he would not interfere.

44:12.458 --> 44:14.750
I know. I'll handle it.

44:14.833 --> 44:17.916
-You have proven you cannot.
-I will.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.458
Ungrateful, Marc,
altering the terms of our agreement.

44:23.541 --> 44:27.375
You were nothing more
than a corpse when I found you.

44:27.458 --> 44:32.000
You think you own this body?

44:34.458 --> 44:38.208
-It belongs to me.
-We'll find the scarab.

44:40.083 --> 44:42.333
Too late. Harrow has it.

44:44.416 --> 44:45.958
Then we'll find another way.

44:46.541 --> 44:48.291
We'll get to Ammit's tomb first.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.916
You know I'll protect you
with everything I have.

44:53.666 --> 44:58.500
-You are worth protecting.
-I'll do whatever it takes then.

44:59.083 --> 45:00.416
Then you let me go.

45:00.500 --> 45:03.250
I know that you enjoy the work
I have for you.

45:03.958 --> 45:06.666
-We need each other.
-We have a deal.

45:06.750 --> 45:12.041
Let me remind you, should we part,
you may not like my next candidate,

45:12.125 --> 45:16.375
near and dear as she is to you.

45:22.333 --> 45:23.541
Where are we going?

45:24.250 --> 45:27.208
Where the hell do you think?
