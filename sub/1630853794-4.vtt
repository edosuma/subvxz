Mama Macaroni's

00:24.190 --> 00:26.985
Whoo! Those garlic knots slap!

00:27.068 --> 00:29.195
Don't get me wrong.
I love me some Mama Mac's.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.532
That pomodoro turns me
into a pomowhoro,

00:32.615 --> 00:34.117
but one day of pure focus

00:34.200 --> 00:36.661
and we're going to be ready
to terraform Gotham

00:36.745 --> 00:37.996
into paradise.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.290
Uh, so Frank
"rising from the ashes reborn"

00:40.373 --> 00:42.000
wasn't the key? He's floating.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.627
Oh, I'm all-powerful.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.879
Check this shit out.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.213
Hmm, ahh.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.798
-Take that, take all of that!
-[Harley] Wow!

00:48.882 --> 00:50.717
Very cool, Frank.
But in this current state,

00:50.800 --> 00:52.427
he can
only pollinate this area.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.680
Please, I can easily get down
with all of Gotham's flora.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.474
No dick mist needed!
You feel me?

00:57.557 --> 01:00.143
Hey, Frank, you're asexual,
so you'd be fucking yourself.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.519
Well, I know I can do that!

01:01.603 --> 01:03.062
Any-hiddly-diddly,

01:03.146 --> 01:05.732
I just need to increase Frank's
seed production tenfold.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.567
And I'm so close.
So if you could just--

01:07.650 --> 01:09.861
He did it! By God, he did it!

01:09.944 --> 01:11.154
Hey, Sy! Sy!

01:11.237 --> 01:13.281
Aye, all this yelling
reminds me

01:13.364 --> 01:16.201
of Kim Jon Il's
real funeral back in '98.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.745
I downloaded Sy
into Catwoman's Smarthome.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.456
He can access
the entire Internet.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.415
Ask him anything.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.833
Who makes the best burger?

01:23.917 --> 01:26.002
Who won best actor
for the 1991 Olivier's?

01:26.085 --> 01:28.129
The horse, Seabiscuit,
and a gay man.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.255
-Amazing.
-He's good.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.673
Ive, ask him something.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.342
Those are also the things
that I wanted to know.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.344

I'm fine. I don't need--

the best PAD band in Gotham.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.436
Don't need the acronym
explained or repeated to me,

02:25.520 --> 02:27.522
but it is like a touch loud.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.065
Do you want us to turn it down?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.776

the vibe or whatever.

Wait, I'm saying it's just
you being a little bitch

02:51.588 --> 02:54.007
and not telling Harley
she's being freaking annoying.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.925
Frank, I like
to employ a tactic

02:56.009 --> 02:58.636
called judicious transparency
in my relationships.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.929
Yeah, yeah, I heard of that.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.431
It's called
being a little bitch.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.932
Hey, a big part
of being in a relationship

03:03.016 --> 03:05.685
is not always telling
the exact truth.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.021
And that way
you can get what you need

03:08.104 --> 03:09.689
without hurting
anyone's feelings.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.399

09:01.832 --> 09:02.917
I never should have left.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.126
I never should've
fricking left.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.628
Oh, Ive,

09:05.711 --> 09:07.797
we are going to find
the asshole who did this, okay?

09:07.880 --> 09:08.881
I promise.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.007
-[beeps]
-[Sy] Is there a villain

09:10.091 --> 09:12.218
who looks like a static screen?

09:12.301 --> 09:13.594
I don't think so.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.554
Damn. Well, then
the cameras are broken.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.472
What?

09:18.432 --> 09:19.642
So, whoever broke in knew

09:19.725 --> 09:20.810
exactly where
all the cameras were.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.562
Wow, that is some devious shit.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.982
I think we're
dealing with a genius.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.733
They may be smart
when breaking in,

09:27.817 --> 09:30.611
but they're not smart when
it comes to securely fastening

09:30.695 --> 09:32.655
festive brooches
to their wardrobe.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.573
Wait a second.
I've seen this before.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.410
[gasps] And I know
who can help us.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.289
How'd you come up
with the answer?

09:41.372 --> 09:42.748
I don't know.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.251
Maybe because my son
can count to fricking seven!

09:45.334 --> 09:47.211
I hate this common core!

09:49.380 --> 09:50.506
[chuckles]

09:50.589 --> 09:52.049
No, you keep going, sport.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.926
Papa needs to talk
with his guests,

09:54.010 --> 09:57.305
who decided to drop in
during homework time.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.390
Someone broke into our place
and stole Frank,

09:59.473 --> 10:00.725
but left this behind.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.102
And it is
the same brooch you had.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.770
Ugh, The Court of Owls?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.273
What is that? Is that
like a bird watching club?

10:07.356 --> 10:08.733
Ha! They wish!

10:08.816 --> 10:12.320
It used to be the city's
most exclusive secret society.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.197
Bankrolled some
intensely evil schemes.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.409
Now, it's just a bunch
of old straight white dudes

10:18.492 --> 10:20.661
jerking each other off.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.413
Headphones, Benny!

10:22.496 --> 10:23.873
Where can we find them?

10:23.956 --> 10:25.958
Assuming they haven't
changed their schedule,

10:26.042 --> 10:28.210
they'll be having their
weekly meeting tonight.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.879
Wednesday nights?
You always told me

10:29.962 --> 10:31.047
you were playing softball.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.715
[laughs] I was lying.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.884
What grown man
plays on a softball team?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.260
So, how do we
get into this meeting?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.679
You just need a mask
and the password.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.431
Lucky for you, I have both.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.766
Hmm.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.100
Here we are. Hmm.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.102
Saves me a trip to Goodwill.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.062
And what's the password?

10:46.145 --> 10:48.814
The password is...

10:48.898 --> 10:50.358
"Hoot hoot."

10:50.441 --> 10:52.401
Seriously? That's like using
your name as the password.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.321
Harley, you literally use
your name for every password.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.280
Are you finished?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.908
Well, let's take a look.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.119
Draw a picture
to explain your answer.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.746
Who gives a shit?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.581
Ha!

11:05.664 --> 11:08.709
Oh, sorry, bud,
I had to get that out.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.044
I'll make it up to you.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.588
What do you say
we get some boba?

11:12.671 --> 11:14.548
[dramatic music playing]

11:14.632 --> 11:17.218
You really think one of these
sick assholes has Frank?

11:17.301 --> 11:18.803
Yes. Just play it cool, okay?

11:20.137 --> 11:22.139
[music intensifies]

11:23.140 --> 11:24.016
Hoot Hoot.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.110
Eyes open for anything
suspicious.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.362
[hooting noise]

11:38.697 --> 11:41.659
Okay, everything's already
suspicious.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.828
[hooting continues]

11:46.789 --> 11:51.252
It is time for
the sacrifice, but,

11:51.335 --> 11:53.796
before we get to that,
just a quick announcement.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.465
Due to a number of complaints
from our newer members

11:56.549 --> 11:58.467
about the inhumane sacrifices

11:58.551 --> 12:02.138
we have been performing
for over 100 years,

12:02.221 --> 12:06.559
a goat pinata will play
the role of an actual
goat tonight.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.144
-[High Owl] I know, I know.
-[man] Favorite part...

12:08.227 --> 12:10.438
There was nothing I could do.
Okay, here we go.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.441
[screams]

12:13.524 --> 12:15.067
[laughing maniacally]

12:16.652 --> 12:19.488
Now that the God's bloodlust
has been satiated,

12:19.572 --> 12:21.782
we're gonna jump right
into cocktail hour.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.285
Okay, so let's just split up
and search the crowd.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.163
Whoever stole Frank has to be
covered in his pollen.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.789
So let's see if it's one of
these creeps.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.084
You're still hot when you
give orders. Mmm.

12:32.168 --> 12:36.464
All right, just go in there
and charm the hell out
of those rich dicks.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.549
Wish you told me
about the mask thing.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.427
Would've worn my sports
goggles from by b-ball days
at the rec center.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.512
Forget about
your God damn glasses.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.181
Focus on the mission at hand!

12:45.264 --> 12:46.599
Get that money.

12:46.682 --> 12:49.018
Got it. Just gonna glad-hand
the hell out of...

12:49.101 --> 12:51.103
God dam, son of a-- Gun.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.106
-[grunts]
-Hey, watch it.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.024
[glass shatters]

12:55.107 --> 12:56.567
[indistinct chatter]

12:57.651 --> 13:00.946
Hey, Mr. Owl Man.
Jim Gordon here.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.406
I'm running for
Mayor of Gotham.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.741
We're not supposed to
use names.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.701
Oh! Right, right, right.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.953
Eh, you already know who I am.
So, like I said,

13:08.037 --> 13:10.122
Jim Gordon, running for Mayor.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.416
Crime's rampant and the current
mayor isn't doing a dosh garn
thing about it!

13:12.500 --> 13:14.543
-Isn't he in a coma?
-Eh, irrelevant.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.671
This damn mask! It does...
It doesn't fit.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.549
I think my head's too small?
Too... too big?

13:20.633 --> 13:21.926
[gasps]

13:22.009 --> 13:23.844
Wait a rotten ham-hawk,
I know that jaw-line.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.847
That stiff upper lip,
those broad shoulders
that look like

13:26.931 --> 13:28.974
they're holding the weight of
the world.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.061
Bruce Wayne. God, it's good to
see a familiar face

13:32.144 --> 13:35.147
-[sighs] Commissioner.
-My God, those shoulders
really are so solid.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.108
Guess I shouldn't be too
surprised to see you at this
chichi shindig.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.486
I like to keep my eye on
Gotham's elite.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.572
Speaking of Gotham, I'm gonna
change the city and I could
really use some of that sweet,

13:43.656 --> 13:45.366
sweet cash that you got
in your pocket.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.369
Also, not to brag, but my good
friend Batman has endorsed me.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.829
-No, he hasn't.
-Well, he hasn't
announced it yet,

13:50.913 --> 13:52.915
but it's coming.
Don't you worry.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.418
Gonna figure this mask out then
I'll circle back with you.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.258
Hey, just out of curiosity,
what were you doing about
two hours ago?

14:02.341 --> 14:03.676
Teaching my kindergarten class.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.386
Oh, wow,
that's really upsetting.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.932
Hey, I know it was you, Bane.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.393
[clears throat] Who is this
Bane you speak of?

14:12.476 --> 14:16.021
Never heard of him.
Though, he does sound
like a pretty cool dude.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.275
Oh, cut the shit. What were you
doing from 5:00 p.m. until now?

14:19.358 --> 14:23.904
Well, 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday
is my standing therapy session.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.658
It was a tough one.
Got into some trust issues.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.909
I think you know why.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.956
You won't give me back
my pasta maker.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.792
-The ultimate betrayal!
-[toilet flushing]

14:36.875 --> 14:39.962
My therapist thinks
we would all benefit

14:40.045 --> 14:41.964
from a group session--
Oh, okay.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.925
So you can use any toilet you
want, but I can't use yours?

14:45.009 --> 14:46.594
Good to see you, too.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.929
But I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

14:49.013 --> 14:52.474
I know all about you texting
Ivy telling her I can't do
anything in your apartment

14:52.558 --> 14:54.810
including use your fancy
Japanese toilet.

14:54.893 --> 14:58.564
[laughs] What would be
the point of stealing
a Komon Clean 6000

14:58.647 --> 15:00.316
if I didn't want to
show it off?

15:00.399 --> 15:01.859
Wh-- That's what I said!

15:01.942 --> 15:06.655
Hmm, seems like your problem
might be with Ivy, not me.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.365
I... Ivy lied to me?

15:10.075 --> 15:11.243
[cell phone ringing]

15:11.327 --> 15:13.495
-King?
-Why thank you.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.039
Got a clue on our thief.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.166
Okay, 'cause we have not
found shit.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.959
Not every camera was broken.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.171
Our fancy, sexy toilet
has one inside

15:22.254 --> 15:24.298
and snapped a butt pic
of the intruder.

15:24.381 --> 15:28.552
Hang on, so someone broke in,
stole Frank, and took a shit?

15:28.636 --> 15:31.013
I cannot confirm
it was in that order.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.391
Anyway, I did a zoom zoom
and enhanced the tuchus photo.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.976
-Sending it now.
-[cell phone chimes]

15:36.060 --> 15:38.187
[Gags] Is that a mole?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.229
[Sy] Bingo!

15:39.313 --> 15:41.357
And this is all you could find?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.318
Pretty good, considering
Harley bashed in the rest
of the cameras.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.528
Wait, what?

15:46.612 --> 15:51.283
[shouting] Pretty good,
considering Harley bashed in
the rest of the cameras!

15:51.367 --> 15:53.160
Huh, see this?
I'm a problem solver.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.996
And I'll bring this kind of
ingenuity all the way to
City Hall.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.873
Jim, if I give you money,
will you leave me alone?

15:57.956 --> 16:00.167
-You betcha.
-Let me get my checkbook.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.378
[grunts]

16:02.461 --> 16:05.673
So Sy just told me something
really interesting.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.383
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.095
That you went full-blown
smashey fit on all of
the cameras.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.181
Well, Catwoman told me
the truth about you guys.

16:14.264 --> 16:17.851
Uh... [sighs] So messed up.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.270
Can we please get out of here
before the party gets started?

16:20.354 --> 16:22.981
Oh, I'd say the party has
already started.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.650
[indistinct conversation]

16:24.733 --> 16:26.902
Fine. Get our coats.

16:26.985 --> 16:31.198
I want to luxuriate
in their emotional discord
for a second.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.908
Why would you lie to me
about that?

16:32.991 --> 16:37.121
I... I didn't lie about it,
I just didn't say anything.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.290
And look, the last time
we hooked up was, like,
four years ago.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.417
Wait, what?

16:41.500 --> 16:44.586
Oh! Okay, we can go.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.755
[glass shattering]

16:46.839 --> 16:48.507
You two used to hook up?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.342
I was talking about
the toilet texts,

16:50.426 --> 16:53.595
but you and that furball
used to hook up?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.431
Let's talk about that!

16:55.514 --> 16:57.433
-Harley...
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.185
You don't get to "Harley" me.
Is there anyone else I
should know about?

17:00.269 --> 17:03.856
Any more shocking sex things
I'm gonna be blindsided with?

17:03.939 --> 17:05.274
[thudding]

17:05.357 --> 17:07.234
-What the hell?
-[eerie music playing]

17:12.030 --> 17:16.660
Let the grand owl orgy begin!
Hoot, hoot!

17:16.744 --> 17:18.912
[all] Hoot, hoot!

17:19.705 --> 17:20.914
[whirring]

17:30.883 --> 17:32.760
[woman moaning]

17:33.927 --> 17:35.846
[all moaning]

17:36.972 --> 17:38.640
[speaking indistinctly]

17:44.938 --> 17:48.358
Honey, let's just forget about
all of this and focus in.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.944
Whoever stole Frank
has this butt mole.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.321
We find this butt mole,

17:52.404 --> 17:54.656
and then we can just drop this
whole thing.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.493
Ooh, there's always a butt mole
whenever we need to talk about
something important.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.746
There's nothing more important
to me right now than finding
Frank.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.164
There's nothing to talk about.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.000
Sorry to eavesdrop,
but if I'm being honest,

18:05.083 --> 18:08.378
it seems like there is
a lot to talk about.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.421
[grunting]

18:09.505 --> 18:11.340
This part's always tricky.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.426
Could one of you gals help me
to unhook my--

18:14.510 --> 18:16.178
-[both] Not now, Bane.
-[Bane] Oh, okay.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.013
It didn't mean anything,
it was ages ago.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.891
Look, we've got this extremely
convenient gift of nakedness.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.268
Now let's just go
and find this mole.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.729
If it didn't mean anything then
why didn't you tell me?

18:25.813 --> 18:29.233
Maybe I didn't tell you
because I knew this is how
you'd react.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.237
Wow. Just wow.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.282
[exhales] Shit!

18:37.366 --> 18:38.534
[water running]

18:38.617 --> 18:40.369
[sigh] Come on, Jimbo,
you got this.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.079
Just talk to a few more people

18:42.162 --> 18:43.872
-and your campaign's
back on track.
-[toilet flushing]

18:43.956 --> 18:45.874
Hmm, first-time jitters?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.918
Uh, let me give you
a piece of advice.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.837
Lube, and plenty of it.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.965
Right, gotta grease the wheels,
butter 'em up.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.469
Why the-- Ow, why is it so
God damn dark in here?

18:57.553 --> 19:00.556
Looking for money and these
assholes can't even
keep the electricity on.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.807
[yells]

19:02.975 --> 19:04.518
Ah, cheesenuts.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.480
The hell is this?
Some kind of Conga line?

19:19.825 --> 19:21.577
Where the hell is it?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.537
Ah, for crying out loud.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.414
Harley...

19:25.497 --> 19:27.082
-[goat bleating]
-[crowd moaning]

19:31.003 --> 19:33.422
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.259
The real reason
I didn't tell you

19:37.342 --> 19:40.846
wasn't because I thought
you'd freak out.

19:40.929 --> 19:45.309
When Catwoman and I hooked up,
I wanted more,

19:45.392 --> 19:48.061
even though it was so obvious
she didn't.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.647
[scoffs] And so,
I waited around,

19:50.731 --> 19:52.566
hoping that she'd
change her mind.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.152
And while I waited,
I was just, like, wrapped
around her little finger

19:55.235 --> 19:57.404
and I still cringe every time
I think about it.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.574
Could you please keep your
talking to a dull sexy roar?

20:00.657 --> 20:01.909
-[grunts]
-[groans]

20:01.992 --> 20:04.077
No! Annihilate my taint.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.537
[wheezing]

20:05.621 --> 20:09.124
Anyway, after it finally ended
I felt so pathetic.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.419
I never wanted to think about
it again, and so when
you brought it up

20:12.502 --> 20:15.923
I just got defensive and I said
something I shouldn't.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.842
[sighs] Harley, it wasn't
even a real relationship

20:18.926 --> 20:22.262
and I know that because
when we got together,

20:22.346 --> 20:26.975
I knew I'd finally found
what I'd been pining for

20:27.059 --> 20:29.186
all these years.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.647
Catwoman didn't mean
a thing to me.

20:31.730 --> 20:36.026
But you, you, Harley,
you mean everything.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.487
Oh.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.490
[moaning]

20:41.573 --> 20:43.825
[people shouting]

20:43.909 --> 20:47.663
One rule at orgies,
never turn the lights on.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.625
But I was almost done
carbo-loading for the fuckfest.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.670
[smacking]

20:55.754 --> 20:57.422
[crowd moaning]

20:58.507 --> 21:00.175
Ah, hot damn!

21:05.430 --> 21:08.183
What in Satan's asshole?

21:08.266 --> 21:11.144
So you didn't get anyone to
donate to the campaign?

21:11.228 --> 21:14.439
No. But I did get a pretty
sweet selfie with Bruce Wayne.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.941
Maybe put it on a billboard!

21:16.900 --> 21:18.485
Hold on, there's a better one.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.030
Huh, I don't remember
taking those.

21:23.657 --> 21:27.452
[laughs] Oh. Gordon,
you brilliant buffoon!

21:27.536 --> 21:30.038
There's only one thing better
than money.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.540
-Love of a woman?
-What?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.250
No. Blackmail.

21:33.333 --> 21:37.212
And now we have videos
of every major player in Gotham

21:37.295 --> 21:39.131
at some weird
sex cult! [laughs]

21:39.214 --> 21:41.550
So that means we can put
the selfie on a billboard?

21:41.633 --> 21:44.219
Oh, that and so much more.

21:44.302 --> 21:46.096
[laughing]

21:47.305 --> 21:48.473
[humming]

21:50.142 --> 21:52.102
[groans] Why the fuck
would they do this

21:52.185 --> 21:53.729
on a concrete floor? [sighs]

21:53.812 --> 21:55.981
I want you to be completely
honest with me

21:56.064 --> 21:58.358
and I will be completely
honest with you.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.569
Here, I'll tell you everyone
I've ever hooked up with.

22:00.652 --> 22:01.903
I'll go from
grossest to hottest.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.655
-Oh, please don't do that.
-Oh.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.407
I'm so glad we worked through
this and everything's okay.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.118
-I mean,
Frank is still missing.
-Oh, right, Frank.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.748
Oh, hey. What the... [gasps]

22:12.831 --> 22:16.668
Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!

22:17.878 --> 22:19.963
[theme music playing]
