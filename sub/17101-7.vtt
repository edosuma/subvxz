01:59.019 --> 02:01.855
NO MATTER HOW BAD
YOU THINK IT IS,

02:01.955 --> 02:03.991
THERE'S NOTHIN'
HAPPENED TO YOU

02:04.091 --> 02:07.728
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.337
NO !NO !

02:42.296 --> 02:44.832
HEY, BEN.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.305
DO YOU WANT TO GO

03:07.388 --> 03:10.391
WHAT CAN I DO TO
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER ?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.596
HMM ?

03:17.465 --> 03:18.999
JESUS, MOTHER OF GOD !

03:19.099 --> 03:21.402
WHAT IN HELL DID
YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR ?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.136
WHAT ?

03:23.237 --> 03:27.107
THAT COLOR IS
PURE COW PISS.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.942
FELIX,
LOOK AT HER !

03:29.042 --> 03:31.745
YOU'RE BLONDE.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.316
WELL, THAT'S RIGHT
AND THERE AIN'T GONNA BE

03:35.416 --> 03:37.485
BUT ONE BLONDETTE
IN THIS SHOW.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.952
LIKE YOU'RE
A REAL BLONDETTE ?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.454
I SEE YOU NAKED
EVERY NIGHT.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.024
FELIX, WOULD YOU TALK
TO YOUR DAUGHTER ?

03:44.124 --> 03:47.628
I THINK SHE
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

03:57.305 --> 04:00.040
DON'T PAY HER
NO MIND NOW.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.209
SHE'S JUST OUT
OF SORTS ABOUT...

04:02.310 --> 04:04.545
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.447
SHE'S JUST
PLAIN MEAN.

04:06.547 --> 04:10.117
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.287
I'M SAD, TOO,
YOU KNOW.

04:13.387 --> 04:17.458
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU
HAPPY, LITTLE GIRL ?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.995
I DON'T KNOW.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.165
I'M SICK OF
THIS PLACE.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.335
ALL OF IT.

04:27.435 --> 04:31.505
CURLY AND JASPER,
THEY LIT OUT LAST NIGHT.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.608
I HEARD.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.480
WE COULD DO THAT
TOO, YOU KNOW.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.016
LEAVE ?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.818
SURE.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.688
JUST...
HIT THE TRAIL.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.257
GO WHERE ?

04:50.358 --> 04:52.693
ANYWHERE BUT TEXAS.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.663
HOLLYWOOD ?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.130
WELL, MAYBE.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.733
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
OUT THERE, DADDY.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.370
PEOPLE GO TO HOLLYWOOD
WITH NOTHING BUT A DREAM,

05:02.470 --> 05:03.971
THEN THEY JUST
GET DISCOVERED

05:04.071 --> 05:05.272
AND BECOME BIG STARS.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.975
THAT WHAT YOU WANT,
LITTLE GIRL ?

05:08.075 --> 05:11.278
ANYTHING'S BETTER
THAN HERE.

05:11.379 --> 05:17.885
WELL, BEST START
PACKING YOUR BAGS.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.333
( inhaling )

05:34.502 --> 05:36.670
( door buzzer )

06:07.835 --> 06:09.437
MISS IRIS...

06:09.537 --> 06:13.173
OH, MISS IRIS THERE'S
A GENTLEMAN HERE TO SEE YOU.

06:13.273 --> 06:18.612
OH, TELL HIM
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.094
MISS CROWE...

06:34.194 --> 06:36.329
IT'S GOOD
TO MEET YOU.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.798
I'M TOMMY DOLAN.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.399
I WORK FOR KZAK RADIO
IN LOS ANGELES.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.868
I'M A REPORTER.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.636
YOU SAID YOU WERE WITH
THE CALIFORNIA MINISTRY !

06:42.736 --> 06:44.204
I WASN'T SURE IF
YOU'D SEE ME, MA'AM.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.006
I KNOW THIS IS
A VERY TRYING TIME.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.240
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.809
NOW, YOU GET
OUTTA THIS HOUSE,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.444
BEFORE I TAKE A HORSEWHIP
TO YOUR BACKSIDE.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.779
I WASN'T TRYING TO PULL
A FAST ONE, MA'AM, I SWEAR.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.614
I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.451
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT,
MR. DOLAN ?

06:57.551 --> 07:00.387
I WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE YOUR BROTHER ALIVE.

07:00.488 --> 07:04.458
THE MAN WHO PUT
THE STORY ON THE RADIO ?

07:04.558 --> 07:08.328
THAT'S ME,
"TALES FROM THE ROAD."

07:08.428 --> 07:11.198
HOW WAS HE ?

07:11.298 --> 07:15.836
UNSHAVEN,
COULD USE A BATH,

07:15.936 --> 07:18.472
BUT HEALTHY,

07:18.572 --> 07:20.908
STRONG OF SPIRIT.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.442
WE WERE PASSING THE BOTTLE
AROUND THE CAMPFIRE

07:22.543 --> 07:23.777
JUST OUTSIDE
OF KINGSBURG...

07:23.877 --> 07:25.779
MY BROTHER
DOESN'T DRINK.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.881
OH, WELL, I MAY BE
WRONG ABOUT THAT PART.

07:27.981 --> 07:32.219
ELROY, JUST PUT IT THERE
WITH THE OTHERS PLEASE.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.754
YES, MA'AM.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.523
WOW, THAT'S
A LOTTA MAIL.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.759
WELL, PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT MY BROTHER, MR. DOLAN.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.661
ABOUT OUR MINISTRY,
GOOD CHRISTIAN PEOPLE.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.696
MAY I ?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.064
I'M...

07:49.402 --> 07:51.138
"DEAR BROTHER JUSTIN,

07:51.238 --> 07:52.773
"WE HEARD YOUR STORY
ON THE RADIO

07:52.873 --> 07:55.142
"AND OUR WHOLE FAMILY WAS
TOUCHED BY YOUR BRAVE STRUGGLE.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.879
"PLEASE ACCEPT THIS DONATION
AS A TOKEN OF OUR BELIEF

07:58.979 --> 08:00.714
IN YOUR MISSION
AND PRAY FOR YOUR... "

08:00.814 --> 08:03.150
A SAWBUCK.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.418
THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD HAS
MOVED HIS PEOPLE TO BE GENEROUS

08:05.519 --> 08:07.287
IN OUR TIME OF NEED.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.789
AMEN.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.457
WHY DON'T WE MOVE
ALL THIS INTO THE KITCHEN.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.893
THANK YOU, BOYS.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.095
SURE LOOKS LIKE A LOT
OF DONATIONS IN THERE.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.131
ENOUGH TO GET YOU STARTED
ON A NEW CHURCH, I BET.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.300
WELL, THAT WILL BE UP
TO MY BROTHER, MR. DOLAN.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.669
YES, OF COURSE.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.871
BUT, AS BROTHER JUSTIN
EXPLAINED IT TO ME,

08:23.971 --> 08:27.240
YOUR PROBLEMS HERE
IN MINTERN GO BEYOND MONEY.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.944
HE TOLD YOU THAT ?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.980
YES, MA'AM, HE DID.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.783
THE MEN WHO
RUN THIS CITY,

08:35.883 --> 08:38.686
THEY WANTED
TO SHUT US DOWN

08:38.786 --> 08:41.054
BECAUSE WE MINISTER
TO MIGRANTS.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.757
WELL, YOU SEE, THERE'S WHERE
I REALLY CAN BE OF HELP.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.827
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IRRITATING

08:46.927 --> 08:48.996
TO A POLITICIAN
THAN A REPORTER.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.565
I DON'T MEAN
TO SOUND UNGRATEFUL,

08:51.665 --> 08:53.400
MR. DOLAN, BUT...

08:53.500 --> 08:56.003
WHAT'S IN IT
FOR YOU ?

08:56.103 --> 08:59.873
WELL, MISS CROWE, WHAT'S
IN IT FOR ME IS A GOOD STORY.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.243
A GOOD STORY MEANS
MORE LISTENERS,

09:03.343 --> 09:06.780
WHICH MEANS MORE RENOWN,
WHICH MEANS MORE MONEY,

09:06.880 --> 09:11.051
WHICH MEANS MORE OF EVERYTHING
TO A LOWLY SINNER LIKE ME.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.922
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED
TO GO TO CHURCH, MR. DOLAN.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.958
I'D BE HAPPY
TO GO ANYWHERE

09:18.058 --> 09:19.760
YOU'D CARE
TO TAKE ME,
MISS CROWE.

09:19.860 --> 09:24.197
I BETTER GO SEE WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THE KITCHEN.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.834
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.236
I'M SURE YOU CAN
FIND YOUR WAY OUT.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.012
( distant voices )

10:05.673 --> 10:08.709
( groaning )

10:44.644 --> 10:46.680
I NEED HELP !

10:52.252 --> 10:54.988
I NEED YOUR HELP !

11:00.093 --> 11:02.229
PLEASE.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.800
( Russian accent )
WHY DO YOU CHASE US ?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.401
I'M NOT CHASING YOU.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.738
WHERE ARE
THE OTHERS ?

11:10.838 --> 11:13.974
NOW, LISTEN.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.043
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT
YOU GO FIND YOUR PARENTS

11:16.143 --> 11:18.946
AND YOU TELL THEM
THAT I'M OUT HERE.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.080
I'M HURT
VERY BADLY.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.249
I NEED HELP.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.485
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER ?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.487
MY MOTHER'S DEAD.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.623
THEN WHERE'S
YOUR FATHER ?

11:30.724 --> 11:33.326
MY FATHER'S
AN EVIL MAN.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.368
HEY !

11:41.468 --> 11:43.971
( whispering )

11:44.071 --> 11:46.373
HEY, WAIT,
WHERE'RE YOU GOING ?!

11:46.473 --> 11:47.607
HEY !

11:47.707 --> 11:49.276
HEY, COME BACK HERE !

11:49.376 --> 11:51.779
COME BACK HERE !

11:51.879 --> 11:54.948
COME BACK !

11:59.186 --> 12:01.021
SO SNAKE CHARMING
PAYS PRETTY GOOD ?

12:01.121 --> 12:04.091
DON'T SEEM NATURAL,
FOLKS PAYING TO SEE THAT.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.993
SOMETHING ABOUT WATCHING
A WOMAN HANDLE A SNAKE

12:06.093 --> 12:09.262
MAKES A MAN
DOWN RIGHT PERCOLATED.

12:09.362 --> 12:14.434
PROBABLY GOES BACK
TO THE SERPENT IN THE GARDEN.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.707
GARDEN OF EDEN,
YOU KNOW ?

12:20.808 --> 12:23.743
YEAH, CORINTHIANS,
EZEKIAL,

12:23.844 --> 12:26.179
REVELATIONS,
MATTHEW, LUKE.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.549
MY MA READ SCRIPTURE
TO ME EVERYDAY.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.284
THAT RIGHT ?

12:31.384 --> 12:35.288
WELL, I GOT A BIBLE IF YOU WANT
TO START READING IT AGAIN.

12:35.388 --> 12:41.995
NAW, HAD ENOUGH OF THAT
FOR ONE LIFETIME.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.899
WELL, REMEMBER NOW,

12:45.999 --> 12:49.002
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A HOGNOSE OR A PLAINBELLY,

12:49.102 --> 12:52.940
BUT THE MARKINGS CAN
SOMETIMES FOOL YOU.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.810
ONE TIME,
DOWN NEAR FORT WORTH,

12:56.910 --> 12:59.212
I CAUGHT WHAT I TOOK
TO BE A PLAINBELLY.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.415
DAMN THING TURNED OUT
TO BE A COTTONMOUTH.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.351
BIT THE HELL
OUTTA ME.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.386
ALMOST DIED.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.088
DAMN.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.491
WAS HACK SCUDDER
WHO PULLED ME THROUGH.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.894
REALLY ?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.595
YEAH, IT'S A FACT.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.031
SAT UP WITH ME ALL NIGHT
DURING THE FEVER.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.268
PUT HIS HAND
ON MY FACE, JUST--

13:23.403 --> 13:26.073
I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK
ON YOUR FACE BEFORE.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.342
YOU DON'T LIKE
TO BE TOUCHED, DO YOU ?

13:29.442 --> 13:32.712
WASN'T MUCH TOUCHIN'
GOING ON IN MY FAMILY.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.549
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.640
WELL.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.510
THAT WEREN'T
SO BAD.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.416
HOLLYWOOD ?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.186
AND WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO IN HOLLYWOOD ?

14:13.286 --> 14:16.957
LIBBY WANTS TO GET
INTO PICTURE SHOWS.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.759
SHE DANCES
THE COOTCH.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.295
WHAT KIND OF PICTURE SHOWS YOU
THINK THEY'RE GONNA PUT HER IN ?

14:22.395 --> 14:23.997
SHE'S A SMART COOKIE,
SHE'LL BE FINE.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.533
WHAT ABOUT US, FELIX,
WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO ?

14:26.633 --> 14:27.734
WE'LL FIND
SOMETHING.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.436
YOU'RE DREAMING
LIKE LIBBY NOW.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.906
ALL I KNOW IS, I WANT
TO GET OUT OF HERE, RITA SUE.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.108
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.177
WE LEAVE HERE WITHOUT
ANOTHER JOB LINED UP,

14:37.277 --> 14:39.346
WE GONNA END UP
ON THE BREAD LINE,

14:39.446 --> 14:40.780
AND THAT IS A FACT !

14:40.880 --> 14:42.916
AND NO DREAMS ABOUT
RUNNING OFF TO HOLLYWOOD

14:43.016 --> 14:44.584
ARE GONNA CHANGE THAT !

14:50.123 --> 14:53.226
THIS FAMILY HAS
GOT TO KEEP GOING.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.997
THERE IS GONNA
BE A SHOW TONIGHT.

14:57.097 --> 15:02.235
AND I'M GONNA
NEED A BALLY.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.240
FELIX ?

15:10.477 --> 15:14.381
SHE AIN'T BUT TWO WEEKS
IN THE GROUND...

15:34.867 --> 15:36.803
IT'S CALLED
BLONDEX.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.671
WELL, I LIKE IT.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.772
REALLY ?

15:39.872 --> 15:41.041
YEAH.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.742
YOU AIN'T JUST
SAYING IT TO BE NICE ?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.111
I'M NOT THAT NICE.

15:44.211 --> 15:47.347
MAMA HAD A DUCK-FIT
ABOUT IT.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.081
I BET.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.816
I KNEW SHE WOULD.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.318
I DON'T CARE.

15:51.418 --> 15:55.655
I DON'T FEEL SO MUCH
LIKE BEING ME RIGHT NOW.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.091
ANYWAY, IT HELPS TO BE BLONDE
IF YOU WANT TO BE IN THE MOVIES.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.759
LIKE JEAN HARLOW.

15:59.859 --> 16:00.827
OR THELMA TODD.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.762
SHE'S GOT
HER OWN CAFE,

16:02.862 --> 16:04.831
"THELMA TODD'S
SIDEWALK CAFE."

16:04.931 --> 16:06.833
AND SHE LIVES
IN THIS APARTMENT ON TOP.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.768
SAYS SHE CAN
LOOK OUT HER WINDOW...

16:08.868 --> 16:11.304
SEE THE OCEAN.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.543
SO WHAT'RE
YOU GONNA DO ?

16:16.643 --> 16:17.744
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE,

16:17.844 --> 16:19.046
THEN GO KNOCKIN'
ON THELMA TODD'S DOOR ?

16:19.146 --> 16:21.914
I'VE GOT WHAT'S CALLED
AN ICE-BREAKER.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.151
THEY TALKED ABOUT
IT IN PHOTOPLAY.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.653
HOW TO ACT NATURAL
IN CASE YOU ENCOUNTER

16:26.753 --> 16:28.055
A MOVIE STAR
IN HOLLYWOOD.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.722
SO WHAT'S YOUR
ICE-BREAKER ?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.491
WE GOT THE SAME
BIRTHDAY !

16:31.591 --> 16:33.760
JULY 29th.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.962
THAT'S GREAT.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.564
BUT HOW YOU GONNA GET
ALL THE WAY OUT TO HOLLYWOOD ?

16:37.664 --> 16:41.768
WE'RE LEAVIN'
TOMORROW.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.372
TOMORROW ?

16:45.472 --> 16:47.674
FOR GOOD ?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.977
CAN'T STAY HERE
NO MORE.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.246
THE IDEA OF GETTING UP
AND DANCING AGAIN

16:53.346 --> 16:55.348
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED...

16:55.448 --> 16:59.186
MOMMA SAYS SHE CAN,
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.289
YOU'LL BE SO MUCH HAPPIER
GETTING OUT OF HERE.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.258
I KNOW.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.028
BE NICE TO BE
SURE, THOUGH.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.565
'BOUT HOW THINGS ARE
GONNA TURN OUT.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.467
I WAS WONDERING...

17:14.567 --> 17:17.604
MAYBE YOU COULD
READ MY CARDS ?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.772
I KNOW YOUR MOMMA DON'T
LIKE ME AND ALL, BUT--

17:19.872 --> 17:21.608
OF COURSE.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.710
COME BY LATER TONIGHT,

17:23.810 --> 17:25.878
AND BRING TWO BITS LIKE
ANY OTHER PAYIN' CUSTOMER

17:25.978 --> 17:27.614
AND MOMMA WON'T
BE ABLE TO SAY A WORD.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.749
TWO BITS.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.419
I'LL LOAN IT
TO YOU.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.033
LOOKS LIKE RUTHIE'S
TAKING UP HER OLD ACT AGAIN.

17:47.134 --> 17:50.603
BOY'S PAINTING UP
HER BANNER REAL NICE.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.572
REALLY ?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.574
SHALL WE ?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.545
YOU KNOW RUTHIE WAS
SOMETHING TO SEE IN HER DAY.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.314
A MAN COULD LITERALLY
BE HYPNOTIZED

18:01.414 --> 18:03.583
BY WATCHING THE SWAYING
OF HER HIPS.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.286
YOU TWO SURE HAVE A LOTTA TIME
TO STAND 'ROUND AND JAW.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.488
WE'LL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR WORK SOON ENOUGH.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.789
HOWEVER...

18:09.889 --> 18:13.025
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE US
TO RESUME OUR DISCUSSIONS.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.728
WHY DON'T YOU TELL YOUR
BLIND OLD GRANDADDY HERE

18:15.828 --> 18:18.365
THAT I AIN'T INTERESTED
AND I NEVER WILL BE.

18:18.465 --> 18:22.535
THINK YOU CAN DISPENSE
WHETHER LISTENING TO OLD LODZ

18:22.635 --> 18:25.037
AND HIS BLIND
DRUNKEN RAMBLINGS.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.874
PERHAPS THIS WILL
INTEREST YOU.

18:27.974 --> 18:31.110
THE TRUTH ABOUT
SCUDDER AND RUTHIE.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.480
THAT GOT
HIS ATTENTION.

18:33.580 --> 18:37.049
DID SHE TELL YOU THE STORY
OF HOW SHE SURVIVED

18:37.150 --> 18:39.586
THE BITE OF
THE COTTONMOUTH ?

18:39.686 --> 18:41.020
HE HELPED HER.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.289
I KNOW ALL
ABOUT THAT.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.892
REALLY,
I'M IMPRESSED.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.795
THEN I TAKE IT
SHE ALSO TOLD YOU HOW,

18:48.895 --> 18:51.898
AS A REWARD
FOR HIS DEVOTION,

18:51.998 --> 18:54.901
SHE TOOK HIM
INTO HER BED.

18:55.001 --> 18:58.371
THE SAME WAY SHE'S
REWARDED THE MANY

18:58.471 --> 19:00.607
WHO HAVE HELPED HER
THROUGH THE YEARS.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.008
UH, OH.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.311
LOVERBOY JUST FOUND OUT
THAT HIS SNAKE

19:04.411 --> 19:08.415
ISN'T THE FIRST ONE CHARMED
IN RUTHIE'S TRAILER.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.025
YOU LEFT SOMETHIN' OUT
OF YOUR STORY THIS MORNING.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.527
WHAT ?

19:20.627 --> 19:21.994
YOU AND SCUDDER.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.162
WHAT ABOUT IT ?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.931
YOU LAID DOWN
WITH HIM.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.299
WHAT ?

19:26.399 --> 19:28.335
IT'S TRUE,
AIN'T IT ?

19:28.435 --> 19:31.338
WHETHER
I DID OR NOT,

19:31.438 --> 19:32.972
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.541
THE HELL IT AIN'T !

19:34.641 --> 19:36.709
YOU TAKE EVERY DRUNK THAT
COMES ALONG INTO YOUR BED ?

19:36.809 --> 19:37.777
THAT'S HOW IT IS ?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.011
I DON'T ANSWER
TO YOU !

19:39.111 --> 19:40.313
GOT ALL THIS TALK,
ALL THIS TIME--

19:40.413 --> 19:42.382
YOU BEEN
LYING TO ME !

19:42.482 --> 19:43.483
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING

19:43.583 --> 19:44.951
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT !

19:45.051 --> 19:46.052
YOU NOTHING BUT
A GODDAMN LIAR !

19:46.152 --> 19:47.687
GABE, STOP !

19:47.787 --> 19:49.422
GABE STOP !

19:49.522 --> 19:51.023
STOP IT !

19:51.123 --> 19:52.792
GABE, PUT HIM DOWN !

19:53.993 --> 19:55.862
PUT HIM DOWN,
YOU'RE HURTING HIM !

19:55.962 --> 19:56.829
GABE !

19:56.929 --> 19:58.398
OH !

19:58.498 --> 20:00.367
BREAK IT UP,
YOU TWO !

20:02.068 --> 20:03.803
GABE !

20:16.483 --> 20:18.184
THIS IS TOMMY DOLAN,
WITH MORE TRUE TALES,

20:18.285 --> 20:20.019
FROM ON THE ROAD.

20:20.119 --> 20:23.623
I'M HERE WITH VAL TEMPLETON
AND HIS LOVELY WIFE CORINE

20:23.723 --> 20:25.958
IN THE SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM
OF THEIR LOVELY

20:26.058 --> 20:29.562
AND WELL-APPOINTED HOME
IN MINTERN, CALIFORNIA.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.499
VAL IS AN IMPORTANT MAN
HERE IN MINTERN,

20:32.599 --> 20:35.302
INDEED HE'S FAST BECOMING
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEN

20:35.402 --> 20:37.337
IN THE ENTIRE
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.673
HIS REPUTATION'S
SPREADING ACROSS THE STATE,

20:40.773 --> 20:43.242
HIS INFLUENCE FELT
ALL THE WAY TO SACRAMENTO,

20:43.343 --> 20:46.045
VAL TEMPLETON TODAY STANDS
ASTRIDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY

20:46.145 --> 20:48.415
LIKE SOME
LATER-DAY COLOSSUS.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.250
YOU'RE TOO KIND,
MR. DOLAN.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.653
I'VE BEEN TALKING
TO MISS IRIS CROWE,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.155
Devoted sister
of Brother Justin Crowe.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.291
She tells me things
aren't going well

20:58.391 --> 20:59.959
DOWN AT THE
DIGNITY MINISTRY.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.828
I BEG PARDON ?

21:01.928 --> 21:04.297
Things aren't
going well

21:04.397 --> 21:06.198
down at Brother Justin's
Dignity Ministry.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.000
THAT A FACT ?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.168
YES, SIR.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.703
NOW, I'M SURE LIKE
THE REST OF MINTERN,

21:10.803 --> 21:12.639
YOU ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED
ABOUT THE WHEREABOUTS

21:12.739 --> 21:16.075
OF BROTHER JUSTIN HIMSELF,
AM I RIGHT, VAL ?

21:16.175 --> 21:18.745
OH...

21:18.845 --> 21:20.112
KEENLY.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.948
MISS CROWE TELLS ME
THEY HAVEN'T BEGUN YET

21:22.048 --> 21:23.550
TO REBUILD THE CHURCH.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.318
APPARENTLY, THEY HAVE NEITHER
THE FUNDS NOR THE CAPACITY

21:25.418 --> 21:27.153
FOR SUCH
AN UNDERTAKING.

21:27.253 --> 21:31.290
I JUST REMEMBERED I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CUT THIS INTERVIEW SHORT

21:31.391 --> 21:33.192
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
SOME VERY IMPORTANT

21:33.292 --> 21:35.161
CITY COUNCIL BUSINESS
AND I'M GONNA HAVE--

21:35.261 --> 21:37.029
VAL, HOW IS THE ARSON
INVESTIGATION GOING ?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.965
THE WHAT ?

21:39.065 --> 21:41.968
WHY, THE INVESTIGATION INTO
WHO BURNED DOWN THE MINISTRY

21:42.068 --> 21:44.203
AND KILLED SIX
INNOCENT CHILDREN.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.938
You are investigating,
aren't you ?

21:46.038 --> 21:47.540
Yes !

21:47.640 --> 21:49.275
CAN OUR LISTENERS BE ASSURED
THAT YOU WILL NOT REST

21:49.376 --> 21:51.511
UNTIL THOSE RESPONSIBLE
ARE FOUND AND PUNISHED ?

21:51.611 --> 21:54.647
JUSTICE
WILL BE SERVED.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.684
HOW MUCH WILL
THE CITY COUNCIL

21:57.784 --> 21:59.919
BE CONTRIBUTING
TO THE REBUILDING EFFORT ?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.421
CONTRIBUTING ?

22:01.521 --> 22:03.322
WITH THE ENTIRE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA

22:03.423 --> 22:05.792
PRAYING FOR JUSTIN'S
SAFE RETURN TO HIS MINISTRY,

22:05.892 --> 22:07.627
SURELY THE CITY OF MINTERN
COULD DO ITS PART

22:07.727 --> 22:09.462
TO RIGHT
THE MONSTROUS WRONG

22:09.562 --> 22:10.997
THAT WAS DONE WITHIN
ITS CITY LIMITS.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.565
I MEAN, A CHURCH
WAS BURNED.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.501
I'M SURE THAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE

22:14.601 --> 22:16.436
TO COME UP WITH
A MODEST CONTRIBUTION.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.606
There is a depression on,
after all.

22:19.706 --> 22:23.342
I'm sure anything
more than 3,000

22:23.443 --> 22:25.878
would be greatly
appreciated.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.781
BLESS YOU, VAL.

22:28.881 --> 22:33.520
LIKEWISE, MR. DOLAN.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.093
( children whispering )

22:41.193 --> 22:43.863
( groaning )

22:59.378 --> 23:00.513
YOU'RE A BAD MAN !

23:00.613 --> 23:03.416
MY FATHER SENT YOU
TO KILL US !

23:07.887 --> 23:10.189
NO, I JUST WANT
TO FIND SOME HELP.

23:10.289 --> 23:12.024
YOU LIE !

23:12.124 --> 23:13.693
MOTHER TOLD US
YOU WOULD !

23:13.793 --> 23:15.628
THAT WE COULD NOT TRUST
ANYONE BUT MAN OF GOD.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.065
I AM A MAN
OF GOD.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.133
YOU LIE !

23:23.436 --> 23:25.972
( distant male voices )

23:29.008 --> 23:30.342
YOU BROUGHT
THEM HERE !

23:30.443 --> 23:31.611
THEY'RE ASSASSINS !

23:31.711 --> 23:33.079
WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

23:33.179 --> 23:34.080
HEY !

23:34.180 --> 23:35.247
OVER HERE !

23:35.347 --> 23:37.750
OVER HERE !

23:42.354 --> 23:44.891
( chattering )

23:56.302 --> 23:57.770
THE FOOL.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.205
THE FOOL ?

23:59.305 --> 24:02.542
WELL, THAT AIN'T GOOD.

24:02.642 --> 24:05.678
NO, IT AIN'T BAD.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.680
IT MEANS
YOU'RE A PERSON

24:07.780 --> 24:09.649
WHO'S LIGHT-HEARTED
AND CAREFREE.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.150
PEOPLE THINK YOU
GOT WILD NOTIONS,

24:11.250 --> 24:14.687
BUT THAT'S JUST CAUSE THEY GOT
NO IMAGINATION OF THEIR OWN.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.191
THE CHARIOT.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.593
I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THAT.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.195
WHY IS IT
UPSIDE DOWN ?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.598
OH, NO REASON.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.534
I DEALT IT WRONG.

24:27.634 --> 24:32.972
THE CHARIOT MEANS
THAT YOU'RE...

24:33.072 --> 24:35.141
DESTINED FOR FAME.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.375
REALLY !

24:36.475 --> 24:37.944
YEAH.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.781
THANK YOU !

24:42.381 --> 24:44.717
THANK YOU !

24:48.087 --> 24:49.689
AND YOU CAN COME OUT
AND VISIT ME SOMEDAY.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.658
WE CAN SWIM
IN THE OCEAN--

24:51.758 --> 24:53.392
AND HAVE COFFEE
WITH THELMA TODD.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.326
YEAH !

24:54.426 --> 24:57.063
I GONNA GO PACK.

25:01.367 --> 25:03.736
BECAUSE YOU'RE WRONG.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.939
SHE'S NOT GONNA DANCE THE COOTCH
THE REST OF HER LIFE.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.509
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER !

25:10.610 --> 25:13.045
YOU KNOW, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS WHOLE PLACE

25:13.145 --> 25:17.016
THAT ACTUALLY THINKS ABOUT
WHAT LIFE'S LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE,

25:17.116 --> 25:19.619
WHO HAS DREAMS.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.925
MY DREAMS ARE NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.361
( Bessie Smith
singing on radio )

25:29.461 --> 25:30.563
DAMN, WOMAN.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.165
YOU STILL
GOT IT IN YA.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.134
TWO HOURS.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.603
ALL BY YOURSELF.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.738
DID YOU SEE
FELIX OUT THERE ?

25:38.838 --> 25:43.910
NAH, TOO MANY
PAYING CUSTOMERS.

25:46.512 --> 25:47.647
RITA SUE, I GOTTA
HAND IT TO YA.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.381
YOU REALLY
SAVED US TONIGHT.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.718
WE IN THE CLOVER.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.989
I BET YOU STUMPY'S GOT
YOU BOOKED SOLID TONIGHT.

25:57.089 --> 26:00.326
I AIN'T SEEING ANY
GENTLEMEN CALLERS TONIGHT.

26:00.426 --> 26:03.529
FELIX AND I
NEED SOME TIME.

26:03.630 --> 26:07.399
* ... A LITTLE SUGAR
IN MY BOWL *

26:07.499 --> 26:14.006
* I NEED A LITTLE HOT DOG
ON MY ROLL *

26:14.106 --> 26:17.176
* I CAN STAND
A BIT OF LOVIN' *

26:17.276 --> 26:20.479
* OH, SO BAD

26:20.579 --> 26:26.686
* I FEEL SO FUNNY,
I FEEL SO SAD *

26:26.786 --> 26:32.892
* I NEED A LITTLE STEAM-HEAT
ON MY FLOOR *

26:32.992 --> 26:38.665
* MAYBE I CAN FIX THINGS UP
SO THEY'LL GO *

26:38.765 --> 26:41.901
* WHAT'S THE MATTER,
HARD PAPA *

26:42.001 --> 26:45.638
* COME ON AND SAVE
YOUR MAMMA'S SOUL *

26:45.738 --> 26:49.809
* BECAUSE I NEED
A LITTLE SUGAR IN MY BOWL *

26:49.909 --> 26:56.582
* DOGGONE IT, I NEED
SOME SUGAR IN MY BOWL *

26:56.683 --> 27:04.290
* I NEED A LITTLE SUGAR
IN MY BOWL *

27:04.390 --> 27:10.697
* I NEED A LITTLE HOT DOG
BETWEEN MY ROLLS *

27:10.797 --> 27:16.769
* YOU GETTIN' DIFFERENT,
I'VE BEEN TOLD *

27:16.869 --> 27:23.075
* MOVE YOUR FINGER

27:23.175 --> 27:30.049
* I NEED A LITTLE STEAM-HEAT
ON MY CLOTHES *

27:30.149 --> 27:36.856
* MAYBE I CAN FIX THINGS UP,
SO THEY'LL GO... *

27:52.638 --> 27:55.341
GOT ANY ROOM
IN THERE FOR ME ?

27:57.343 --> 27:59.478
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' UP ?

27:59.578 --> 28:01.948
OH, MA PUT
THE RED PIG OUT...

28:02.048 --> 28:03.482
AGAIN.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.184
RED PIG ?

28:05.284 --> 28:06.352
IT'S A SIGNAL.

28:06.452 --> 28:09.021
MEANS SHE WANTS
TO GET PORKED.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.893
C'MON.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.743
( giggling )

28:34.947 --> 28:37.349
I WONDER IF YOU GOT THE SAME
BIRTHDAY AS ANYBODY FAMOUS.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.485
PROBABLY NOT.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.887
WHEN IS IT ?

28:40.987 --> 28:43.856
I DON'T KNOW
MY EXACT BIRTHDAY.

28:43.956 --> 28:47.559
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW
YOUR OWN BIRTHDAY ?

28:47.659 --> 28:51.630
THE DAY
MOMMA HAD ME...

28:51.730 --> 28:53.866
WAS THE DAY
SHE TOOK SICK.

28:53.966 --> 28:57.203
AND ALL SHE REMEMBERS IS
THE CHERRY TREES WERE BLOOMIN',

28:57.303 --> 29:00.306
SO I PICK A DIFFERENT DAY
EVERY YEAR.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.474
ALWAYS IN THE SPRING.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.845
YOU AIN'T LIKE
ANYBODY ELSE, ARE YA ?

29:15.421 --> 29:18.190
WHAT'S WRONG ?

29:21.794 --> 29:23.729
I JUST CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.531
I WAITED THIS LONG

29:25.631 --> 29:27.566
AND NOW YOU'RE LEAVIN'.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.601
COME WITH US.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.204
I CAN'T.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.473
WHY ?

29:35.541 --> 29:38.210
IT'S YOUR MA ?

29:40.746 --> 29:42.314
LISTEN, THEY'LL
TAKE CARE OF HER.

29:42.414 --> 29:46.218
BESIDES, YOU CAN ALWAYS
SEND FOR HER LATER.

29:47.854 --> 29:50.722
SOFIE, YOU GONNA BE A CARNIE
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ?

29:50.823 --> 29:53.826
GOING FROM ONE SHITHOLE TOWN
TO ANOTHER ?

29:53.926 --> 29:56.462
BARELY MAKING
ENDS MEET ?

29:56.562 --> 30:00.132
THIS AIN'T NO LIFE.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.079
( metal creaking )

31:00.359 --> 31:01.593
OH !

31:01.693 --> 31:02.962
HEY, LOOK OUT !

31:03.062 --> 31:04.931
IT'S RAININ'
ALCOHOL !

31:05.031 --> 31:08.100
STUMPY, WHAT THE HELL

31:08.200 --> 31:09.835
WELL, I CLIMBED UP...

31:09.936 --> 31:12.972
AND NOW I CAN'T
SEEM TO CLIMB DOWN !

31:13.072 --> 31:15.807
LET ME HELP YOU.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.476
ALRIGHT.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.411
( laughing )

31:19.511 --> 31:22.181
GRAB MY HAND.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.153
JESUS, ALMOST BROKE
YOUR DAMN NECK.

31:27.253 --> 31:30.923
GOD, YOU ARE CORK HIGH
AND BOTTLE DEEP.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.125
I'M SNOT-FLYIN' DRUNK,
MY FRIEND.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.994
YOU CARE
TO JOIN ME ?

31:35.094 --> 31:38.730
ONCE I GET STARTED,

31:38.830 --> 31:40.799
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO RACE ME
TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT BOTTLE.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.569
THE RACE IS ON !

31:43.669 --> 31:46.138
GIDDY UP.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.311
AAH.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.679
RED EYE ?

31:53.779 --> 31:55.681
THAT'S REGULAR
AGGIE FORTY.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.984
I GOT COON DICK
HERE, TOO.

31:58.084 --> 32:02.121
WHICH DO YOU PREFER ?

32:02.221 --> 32:05.491
YOUR DRUTHERS
IS MY RUTHERS.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.060
( laughing )

32:10.862 --> 32:13.399
EVERY WHICH WAY I TURN,

32:13.499 --> 32:17.669
I SEE MY LITTLE GIRL.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.278
EVERY WHICH WAY.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.556
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
SWEETIE.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.325
( Gabe )
OKAY, MAMA.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.299
HOW IS HE ?

32:52.371 --> 32:54.906
TOOK A WHILE TO MOVE
THE BONE BACK INTO PLACE,

32:55.007 --> 32:57.509
BUT IT WAS
A CLEAN BREAK.

32:57.609 --> 33:02.948
SHOULD HEAL FINE LONG AS
INFECTION DON'T GET IN.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.616
I'M SORRY.

33:04.716 --> 33:08.520
THAT MEANS EXACTLY LESS
THAN NOTHIN' TO ME RIGHT NOW.

33:09.588 --> 33:10.922
YOU WERE RIGHT.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.824
THAT WAS NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.560
I DON'T ANSWER
TO NO MAN.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.128
NEVER HAVE...

33:16.228 --> 33:20.366
AND AIN'T GONNA
START NOW.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.870
'SIDES...

33:24.970 --> 33:27.039
THINGS I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU.

33:27.139 --> 33:32.111
THINGS YOU DON'T
KNOW ABOUT ME.

33:33.879 --> 33:37.583
JUST GONNA HAVE
TO ACCEPT THAT.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.718
OKAY.

33:57.669 --> 34:00.939
( Doland )
Anything more than 3,000
would be greatly appreciated.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.274
Bless you, Val.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.277
HE'S GOING
TO DONATE MONEY

34:05.377 --> 34:07.779
TO OUR CHURCH
TO HELP REBUILD.

34:07.879 --> 34:11.083
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.185
LIVE ON THE AIR.

34:13.285 --> 34:16.855
BE HARD FOR A POLITICIAN
TO TAKE IT BACK NOW.

34:16.955 --> 34:20.692
OH THAT'S...

34:20.792 --> 34:23.862
THAT'S REMARKABLE.

34:23.962 --> 34:28.200
THAT'S TRULY REMARKABLE,
MR. DOLAN.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.139
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING
OVER THE RECORDING THIS EVENING.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.907
I'M SORRY
I MISSED IT LIVE.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.944
BUT I WAS
IN PRAYER.

34:39.044 --> 34:41.513
NOT AT ALL, I TOLD YOU
I WANTED TO HELP.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.651
HAVE SOME MORE.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.386
NO, PLEASE.

34:47.486 --> 34:49.188
I'M NOT USED
TO DRINKING.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.022
JESUS TURNED WATER
INTO WINE...

34:51.123 --> 34:54.593
THAT'S QUITE AN
ENDORSEMENT IN MY BOOK.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.396
I FEEL DECADENT.

34:57.496 --> 35:01.833
THAT'S NOT A BAD
FEELING, IS IT ?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.012
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOU.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.747
THERE'S NOT
MUCH TO TELL.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.048
HMM...

35:17.149 --> 35:18.884
SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE A COMPLICATED WOMAN.

35:18.984 --> 35:22.221
NO, I'M ACTUALLY
VERY SIMPLE.

35:22.321 --> 35:27.326
I LIVE MY LIFE
TRUSTING THE LORD.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.900
CAN I TELL YOU
A STORY ?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.668
ONE THAT
I HAVE HEARD ?

35:36.768 --> 35:37.903
PLEASE.

35:38.003 --> 35:42.341
THERE WERE
TWO CHILDREN

35:42.441 --> 35:44.776
A BOY...

35:44.876 --> 35:47.246
A GIRL...

35:47.346 --> 35:50.416
IMMIGRANTS,
FROM RUSSIA.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.685
AND THEY WERE TRAVELLING
WITH THEIR MOTHER,

35:53.785 --> 35:55.287
BY TRAIN.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.924
ONE NIGHT, THERE WAS
A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.427
A BRIDGE COLLAPSED,

36:01.527 --> 36:04.062
AND THE TRAIN WENT
DOWN INTO THE WATER.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.931
THERE WERE
NO SURVIVORS.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.700
EXCEPT THE BOY
AND THE GIRL.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.968
My mother's dead.

36:10.068 --> 36:13.071
BY GOD'S DIVINE MERCY,
THEY SURVIVED.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.007
WASHED UP
ON A RIVERBANK.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.977
THEY WERE PURSUED.

36:19.077 --> 36:21.079
Why do you
chase us ?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.615
A MAN WAS SENT
TO KILL THEM.

36:23.715 --> 36:27.253
You brought them here,
they're assassins !

36:32.558 --> 36:35.093
THE GIRL FOUGHT
TO PROTECT HER BROTHER.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.663
AND THEN THE DAY CAME

36:37.763 --> 36:41.767
WHEN THE BOY HAD
TO PROTECT HIS SISTER.

36:48.374 --> 36:51.009
Do you understand
English ?

36:51.109 --> 36:54.780
I need your help.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.050
The girl...

36:59.150 --> 37:01.620
your sister,
she's your sister, right ?

37:01.720 --> 37:06.292
Your sister is being
very, very bad.

37:06.392 --> 37:09.728
She is getting both of you
in a lot of trouble.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.998
When people find me,

37:13.098 --> 37:15.434
I will tell them
what you've done...

37:15.534 --> 37:18.069
and you'll be punished,
you'll be beaten.

37:18.169 --> 37:22.641
( speaking Russian )

37:26.278 --> 37:28.314
But, you're a good boy.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.549
You're a good boy,
I can see that.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.018
I know you want
to do right.

37:33.118 --> 37:36.021
I know you
want to help me.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.690
No, don't worry
about her.

37:38.790 --> 37:39.625
Don't worry.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.360
You're the man
of the family.

37:41.460 --> 37:44.029
Be the man
and take charge.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.698
( speaking Russian )

37:51.303 --> 37:53.104
Aah !

37:53.204 --> 37:55.674
( speaking Russian )

37:58.810 --> 38:00.178
Irina !

38:00.278 --> 38:04.215
You get help now !

38:04.316 --> 38:07.819
( shouting in Russian )

38:07.919 --> 38:09.588
No, Alexsei !

38:09.688 --> 38:11.823
( choking )

38:23.369 --> 38:24.836
( bones snapping )

38:29.375 --> 38:33.078
C'MON NOW, MISTER,
STEP DOWN.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.748
NOTHING'S
WORTH THIS.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.354
I KILLED HIM.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.060
YOU ALRIGHT, MISTER ?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.061
YOU ALRIGHT ?

38:50.161 --> 38:51.363
THIS WAS NOT
VISITED UPON ME.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.031
THIS IS
MY BIRTHRIGHT.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.132
WHAT'S THAT ?

38:54.232 --> 38:55.367
THIS IS
MY BIRTHRIGHT...

38:55.467 --> 38:57.202
MY BIRTHRIGHT.

38:57.302 --> 38:58.404
YEAH, SURE IT IS.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.971
GET HIM UP.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.483
WOW.

39:11.583 --> 39:15.921
AND THEY WERE
THE ONLY TWO SURVIVORS.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.526
THAT'S QUITE A STORY.

39:20.626 --> 39:23.294
MORE OF A
PARABLE REALLY.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.231
IN RUSSIA,
THERE'S A SAYING:

39:26.331 --> 39:32.538
( speaking Russian )

39:32.638 --> 39:37.108
"PRAY TO GOD,
BUT ROW FOR SHORE."

39:37.208 --> 39:43.248
FAITH AND ACTION.

39:43.348 --> 39:47.152
THAT'S HOW I LIVE
MY LIFE, MR. DOLAN.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.971
WRITE UP AN AD TO POST
IN THE BILLBOARD.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.006
WHAT KINDA AD ?

40:08.106 --> 40:10.375
FOR A NEW
COOTCH GIRL.

40:10.476 --> 40:13.411
WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

40:13.512 --> 40:15.647
WE NEED
ANOTHER DANCER.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.717
I CAN'T GO
SOLO FOREVER

40:18.817 --> 40:20.619
AND EVEN WHEN LIBBY
GETS BACK IN THE GAME,

40:20.719 --> 40:22.488
WE'RE STILL SET-UP
FOR A THREE-GIRL SHOW.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.990
NOW WE AIN'T GONNA FIND
ANYONE IN THESE COW TOWNS,

40:25.090 --> 40:27.859
SO, YOU'RE GONNA WRITE US AN AD
TO BRING IN A PROFESSIONAL.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.361
WE'RE LEAVING...

40:30.462 --> 40:32.397
TODAY.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.633
NO, WE'RE NOT.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.368
I AM.

40:37.469 --> 40:40.138
I'M TAKING
MY DAUGHTER WITH ME.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.740
NO, YOU WON'T.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.709
YOU AIN'T GONNA
LEAVE ME, FELIX.

40:43.809 --> 40:48.179
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO BEGIN TO LEAVE ME.

40:53.184 --> 40:56.822
( wind whistling )

41:17.876 --> 41:19.144
C'MON.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.012
IT'S OKAY.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.234
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST ME NOW.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.672
I TRUST YOU, BEN.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.140
AND YOU CAN'T TELL
NOBODY ABOUT THIS.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.442
OKAY, NOBODY.

41:51.543 --> 41:54.913
IT'S A SECRET.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.478
THAT'S IT.

42:27.579 --> 42:29.881
MOVE IT AROUND.

42:34.419 --> 42:36.855
HERE.

42:39.490 --> 42:41.827
MOVE IT AROUND.

43:22.668 --> 43:24.335
THOUGHT YOU
WERE LEAVING.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.838
THOUGHT WRONG.

43:26.938 --> 43:30.275
I SEEN STUMPY
PACKING UP.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.543
DON'T MATTER.

43:32.644 --> 43:35.580
YOU SURE ?

43:35.681 --> 43:37.683
HE SEEMED PRETTY
SET ON GOING.

43:37.783 --> 43:41.019
I KNOW HIM.

43:49.795 --> 43:53.932
I BEEN MEANING TO SAY
SOMETHING FOR A WHILE.

43:55.767 --> 43:59.070
I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO TO BABYLON.

44:02.207 --> 44:03.541
BUT I DID.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.643
I HAD MY ORDERS.

44:05.744 --> 44:12.317
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE
STOOD UP.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.889
IT'S MY FAULT WHAT
HAPPENED TO DORA MAE.

44:20.892 --> 44:23.561
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
DON'T DO THE BLOW-OFF.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.765
IT WAS ME THAT
MADE THAT DECISION.

44:26.865 --> 44:33.204
IF I HAD IT
TO DO OVER AGAIN...

44:34.272 --> 44:36.174
YEAH.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.911
THING THAT
TEARS ME UP...

44:40.011 --> 44:43.581
IS KNOWIN' THAT BASTARD
WHO KILLED HER,

44:43.681 --> 44:47.018
IS STILL OUT THERE
WALKIN' ROUND.

44:48.419 --> 44:51.089
NO, HE AIN'T.

44:59.264 --> 45:01.733
YOU CAN ONLY
KNOW A MAN SO MUCH.

45:21.853 --> 45:24.322
IT'S MY CHANCE.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.399
GOODBYE, MOTHER.

45:43.041 --> 45:44.309
WELL.

45:44.409 --> 45:48.513
HERE WE GO NOW.

45:48.613 --> 45:49.747
HERE WE GO.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.282
I CAN'T

45:51.382 --> 45:52.450
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

45:52.550 --> 45:53.651
YEAH.

45:53.751 --> 45:56.087

WHAT'S GOING ON ?

46:27.452 --> 46:30.922
PLEASE,
LET'S GO.

46:32.991 --> 46:35.827
I THINK TOMORROW
WOULD BE BETTER, BABY.

46:40.966 --> 46:43.835
DADDY,
WE HAD A PLAN.

46:46.771 --> 46:49.540
I KNOW, BABY,

46:49.640 --> 46:51.242
DADDY, WE'RE GONNA

47:23.942 --> 47:26.477

STILL DO THIS.

47:26.577 --> 47:27.946
I CAN DRIVE,
WE CAN--

47:28.046 --> 47:31.449
DADDY DON'T LIKE
NO ONE ELSE TO DRIVE HIS CAR.

47:36.421 --> 47:37.555
LIBBY...

47:50.902 --> 47:52.603
HEY, PUT IT BACK
IN THE SLING.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.239
PUT IT BACK.

48:20.831 --> 48:24.302
YEAH, YOU MIGHT'VE
KNOWN THAT, BUT...

48:24.402 --> 48:29.407
I TELL YOU SOMETHING, MOTHER,
YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

48:34.879 --> 48:36.982
GUESS WHO
I JUST SAW ?

48:37.082 --> 48:40.885
I HAVE A HEADACHE, DEAR,
PLEASE, NO GAMES.

48:40.986 --> 48:44.255
GABRIEL AND BEN
WALKING THROUGH THE MIDWAY.
