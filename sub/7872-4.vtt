00:17.283 --> 00:19.318
(Johnny Carson
<i>Tonight Show</i> theme playing)

00:19.320 --> 00:23.622
KANG:
<i>Live from Rigel 7, Conquerors</i>

00:45.980 --> 00:48.814
(applause and cheering)

00:48.816 --> 00:51.817
Why?

00:51.819 --> 00:54.219
(Kang and Kodos laughing)

01:04.497 --> 01:07.232
This has been a bad week,
even for you, Simpson.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.667
Concrete in the sandbox?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.235
I don't get lost anymore!

01:10.237 --> 01:11.870
Spreading the rumor
that today's lunch

01:11.872 --> 01:13.338
would be served
by a naked lady.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.040
Move it!
Boobs! Boobs!

01:15.042 --> 01:17.176
I want to see boobs in the soup!

01:17.178 --> 01:19.011
There is no naked lunch lady!
Bart made it up!

01:19.013 --> 01:21.180
Yes, yes,
I-I knew that.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.015
There's no hope
for you, Simpson.

01:23.017 --> 01:24.349
You'll be locked
in detention

01:24.351 --> 01:26.185
until you graduate
to the penal system.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.686
(laughing)
Penal.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.722
Stop laughing! I said
"penal," not "penile."

01:30.724 --> 01:32.524
(laughs)
Penile.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.760
It's not like you
made me say "penis"!

01:34.762 --> 01:36.762
(laughing)

01:36.764 --> 01:39.431
(groaning)

01:53.913 --> 01:56.281
Hmm.

01:59.085 --> 02:01.086
Ow! Oh.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.222
Someone could get really hurt
by this.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.756
Stick your finger
in that desk.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.891
Really, Bart?

02:05.893 --> 02:08.427
Hmm, looks like ancient Aramaic.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.929
Fortunately, I have
an app for that.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.397
(beep)

02:12.399 --> 02:15.300
(click, trilling, ding)

02:15.302 --> 02:16.301
Hey!

02:16.303 --> 02:19.438
"He who reads
this rune translation

02:19.440 --> 02:23.242
will be taken to damnation"?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.644
(both gasp)

02:25.646 --> 02:28.947
(both scream)

02:28.949 --> 02:30.415
(hissing)

02:30.417 --> 02:32.751
(alarm sounding)
SKINNER:
Simpson!

02:32.753 --> 02:34.887
(hissing)

02:38.258 --> 02:39.825
(both grunt)

02:39.827 --> 02:41.160
BOTH:
Huh?

02:41.162 --> 02:42.494
We're in Hell?!

02:42.496 --> 02:44.830
Cool! Now I can look
up all those people

02:44.832 --> 02:46.431
who said "See
you in Hell."

02:46.433 --> 02:48.300
Hey, pal, what are
you in here for?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.768
Heresies, like Docetism.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.270
Docetism?

02:51.272 --> 02:53.305
The belief that Jesus' body
was just an illusion.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.640
Is that still big?

02:54.642 --> 02:57.309
Haw-haw! Your heresies
were venialized

02:57.311 --> 02:59.011
by the council
of Palermo.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.013
Oh, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

03:01.015 --> 03:02.781
(crowd chatter and groaning)

03:02.783 --> 03:06.118
We've got millipedes,
toothheads, screaming torsos...

03:06.120 --> 03:07.519
(screaming)

03:07.521 --> 03:09.354
...your bleeding eyes
with finger-legs.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.356
And all the girls
are mean girls.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.492
Red dress,
how original.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.128
Making fun of someone's clothes.
How original.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.397
Huh. You want
to walk with us?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.533
It's true.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.937
It would be a cold day
in Hell when I was popular.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.373
Huh?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.975
Young man,
where's your Hell pass?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.643
Skin him!

03:31.645 --> 03:32.811
Whoa.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.146
(gasps)

03:34.148 --> 03:35.547
(grunts)

03:35.549 --> 03:36.815
Huh?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.150
Hmm.

03:38.152 --> 03:39.685
So,

03:39.687 --> 03:42.487
what would be
the appropriate eternal torture

03:42.489 --> 03:45.390
for someone who robbed a bank?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.492
(flame whooshing)

03:47.494 --> 03:48.894
Uh...

03:49.862 --> 03:51.897
Someone who robs a bank.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.333
How would you punish them
for all time?

03:54.335 --> 03:56.068
Mm... Jeffistopheles?

03:56.070 --> 03:58.036
(in squeaky voice):
Uh... wh-whipping?

03:58.038 --> 03:59.571
Okay. Good.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.006
No one likes to be whipped,

04:01.008 --> 04:04.710
but is there anything
more connected to the sin?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.411
Torture?

04:06.413 --> 04:09.414
What if you made the robber
eat bags of money

04:09.416 --> 04:11.216
until his stomach exploded?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.685
Good. <i>Very</i> good.
(high-pitched whooshing)

04:13.687 --> 04:15.087
Mm.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.888
Psychological
torment.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.423
Pain plus fear.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.193
Oh, can you all feel
how much richer that is?

04:21.195 --> 04:22.694
You get a pumpkin sticker.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.229
Ow.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.031
(gasps)
This has never happened before.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.532
I have a crush on my teacher!

04:27.534 --> 04:30.035
Down here, we can
make that happen.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.870
(locker door squeaks)

04:31.872 --> 04:34.373
(both giggle)

04:34.375 --> 04:36.541
Every time the sinner
screams in pain,

04:36.543 --> 04:38.110
the scream blows this windmill,

04:38.112 --> 04:41.380
which pumps even more piranhas
into his aquarium underwear,

04:41.382 --> 04:42.614
causing more screaming.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.550
Wow. Wow.
Oh, that is
so evil.

04:45.552 --> 04:48.220
And I know evil.
I'm head of the teachers' union.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.554
(bell ringing)

04:49.556 --> 04:51.890
(grunting and groaning)

04:51.892 --> 04:54.960
Bart, I found a portal
back to Earth.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.729
Right here?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.898
No, no, no, no!
That's Super Hell!

04:59.900 --> 05:01.466
Hot Stuff?

05:01.468 --> 05:03.402
I didn't realize
you were that evil.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.404
(à la Droopy):
No, I'm being punished

05:05.406 --> 05:07.806
for how lame my comics were.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.308
(whooshing)

05:09.310 --> 05:12.077
I melted it. Get it?

05:12.079 --> 05:13.245
(crow caws)

05:13.247 --> 05:16.748
(flames whooshing, hissing)

05:16.750 --> 05:19.418
Welcome to Earth.
Local time is 10:37.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.420
We know you have your
choice of portals,

05:21.422 --> 05:23.422
so thank you for choosing
the Burns Hellport,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.090
a division of
Gulf and Western.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.658
(Lisa pants, Bart grunts)

05:27.093 --> 05:28.260
Mom, Dad,

05:28.262 --> 05:29.761
I want to
change schools.
Hmm?!

05:29.763 --> 05:32.297
I found a place
that really wants to teach me,

05:32.299 --> 05:33.665
and I really want to learn.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.168
Homie, our prayers
have been answered.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.337
Keep your pants on, Marge.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.771
It's probably
some private school

05:39.773 --> 05:41.640
that costs
a million dollars a year,

05:41.642 --> 05:43.508
and then they squeeze you
for extra money

05:43.510 --> 05:45.777
through book fairs
and silent auctions.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.347
And parents get 20 e-mails a day
from the school,

05:48.349 --> 05:50.816
and everyone hits
"reply all" to everything.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.951
Dad, it's not a
private school.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.186
It's free.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.987
Oh, that's fine then.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.489
(man screaming)

05:57.491 --> 06:00.692
I couldn't help noticing
this school is located in...

06:00.694 --> 06:02.961
I'm not one
to judge, but, um...

06:02.963 --> 06:05.497
I'll say it, Marge.
It's in Hell!

06:05.499 --> 06:08.300
The Inferno!
Perdition!

06:08.302 --> 06:10.001
Arizona without the golf!

06:10.003 --> 06:13.972
No. We do have golf,
but all the greens are tricky.

06:13.974 --> 06:14.673
No!

06:14.675 --> 06:16.174
Look, as educators,

06:16.176 --> 06:19.878
our job is to gently nurture
your child's passion.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.680
Hmm. That is
the kind of nonsense

06:21.682 --> 06:22.981
you're always
falling for.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.017
Mom, please tell me
I can go to Hell.

06:26.019 --> 06:29.521
Well, I guess
we could try it for a semester.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.890
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.658
You know,
we have many opportunities

06:33.660 --> 06:34.993
for parent involvement.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.161
(scoffs)

06:36.163 --> 06:39.398
Yeah, I'll be sure
to take a look at that.

08:04.785 --> 08:08.086
I don't care! Why am I here?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.755
You changed the "R-E"

If there can be two incarnations
of the Simpsons,

20:11.211 --> 20:13.511
why couldn't
some evil marketing entity

20:13.513 --> 20:15.179
produce millions of others?

20:15.181 --> 20:18.482
(new Homer voice):
All right, Simpsons,
welcome to our new home.

20:18.484 --> 20:22.553
Yo, yo, Santa's Little Helper
is in da house!

20:22.555 --> 20:24.555
(howls)

20:27.226 --> 20:29.060
(fierce grunt)

20:30.162 --> 20:32.396
♪

20:35.667 --> 20:37.268
Mmm!

20:38.503 --> 20:40.037
(squeaky gibberish)

20:40.039 --> 20:42.073
(high-pitched):
D'oh!

20:47.012 --> 20:49.013
Okay, hold still.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.349
This is the last
picture on the roll.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.217
Isn't it about time
you went digital?

20:53.219 --> 20:55.052
Watch your mouth,
you little smart-ass.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.587
ORIGINAL LISA:
Yeah, Bart.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.522
Nothing's gonna ruin this one.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.357
(timer ticking)

20:59.359 --> 21:02.059
Here we go.
Here we go.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.262
Here we go.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.529
(gulping)

21:05.531 --> 21:08.666
