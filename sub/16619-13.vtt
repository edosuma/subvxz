09:47.597 --> 09:50.064
Alex and I will take the
library and the Reserve.

09:50.066 --> 09:51.899
You three take the
bank and the Exchange.

09:51.901 --> 09:53.400
Okay.

- Keep your comms open.
- Okay.

09:56.405 --> 10:01.008
The list of charges against
the Citizen's Liberation Front,

10:01.010 --> 10:03.110
which includes both of you,

10:03.112 --> 10:05.612
is... why don't we start with

10:05.614 --> 10:07.947
arson, assault,

10:07.949 --> 10:10.416
conspiracy to defraud the government,

10:10.418 --> 10:12.451
possession of a biological weapon,

10:12.453 --> 10:16.589
extortion, <i>homicide</i> in
the first and second degree.

10:16.591 --> 10:20.865
Oh, right, and treason.

10:20.868 --> 10:23.228
I was told these people
wanted to do good.

10:23.230 --> 10:24.529
They did.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.067
Miranda knew this was coming.

10:28.069 --> 10:31.269
She asked me to be her
eyes and ears on the inside,

10:31.271 --> 10:33.371
just in case things got out of control.

10:33.373 --> 10:35.074
But neither of us could predict

10:35.076 --> 10:37.710
the Citizen's Liberation
Front would turn radical

10:37.712 --> 10:40.277
and so much blood would be spilled.

10:40.279 --> 10:44.816
Since there is no precedent
for two decorated agents

10:44.818 --> 10:47.151
taking up arms against
their own country,

10:47.153 --> 10:49.987
I'm gonna have to make a
few phone calls to figure out

10:49.989 --> 10:51.388
what the procedure is.

10:54.627 --> 10:57.160
Now, when an operative dies,

10:57.162 --> 11:00.831
we add a star to
Langley's Wall of Honor.

11:00.833 --> 11:03.967
And currently, that wall has 117 stars.

11:03.969 --> 11:10.073
That's 117 Agency employees
who died doing their duty.

11:10.075 --> 11:13.776
Now, to keep you off that wall,

11:13.778 --> 11:17.146
and to keep me from appearing
at your loved ones' front door,

11:17.148 --> 11:20.349
we ask all operatives
to put together an EAP,

11:20.351 --> 11:22.985
or emergency action plan.

11:22.987 --> 11:24.653
This is a course of action

11:24.655 --> 11:28.357
for how to get out
alive if you're exposed.

11:28.359 --> 11:31.092
Now, when you're exposed,

11:31.094 --> 11:33.862
you have to find a way to
communicate with your assets

11:33.864 --> 11:36.464
quickly and discreetly via dead drop.

11:36.466 --> 11:38.432
It begins with a signal.

11:39.988 --> 11:42.103
When the asset collects the drop,

11:42.105 --> 11:44.605
it's important for them to signal back.

11:49.444 --> 11:53.013
Even in this digital age,

11:53.015 --> 11:57.985
don't discount the importance
of good, old-fashioned spycraft.

11:57.987 --> 12:01.354
And whatever you do, don't get caught!

12:01.356 --> 12:03.323

12:12.801 --> 12:15.201

Keyes: Now, sometimes you can't
even risk contact with your assets.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.507
Every drop, every signal
may be compromised.

12:21.509 --> 12:24.242
In that case, there's only one option...

Leonard Cohen beg to differ.

Hey, did you speak to
Lydia about Jeremy Miller?

20:40.421 --> 20:43.722
Yes, and she had no idea about him.

20:43.724 --> 20:45.423
The prevailing theory is that,

20:45.425 --> 20:46.725
he followed the tap that I put in

20:46.727 --> 20:48.359
and hijacked the feed.

20:48.361 --> 20:49.928
Okay, they think that he is obsessed

20:49.930 --> 20:51.221
over being cut out of The Farm

20:51.224 --> 20:53.098
and that he was planning something big.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.665
Maybe even going after all of us.

20:54.667 --> 20:55.934

have been a good thing,

21:02.674 --> 21:04.507
The FBI wouldn't tell me anything.

21:04.509 --> 21:06.844
That's because you're not FBI anymore.

21:06.846 --> 21:09.346

Wow. You seem happy. I
haven't seen that in a while.

22:30.858 --> 22:32.958
Yeah, well, I came here
with good intentions.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.160
And like all good intentions,
they went up in smoke.

22:35.162 --> 22:37.595
So, I'd like to drink to
forget I ever had them.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.299

the lies in between us.

you or even talking to you,

23:26.911 --> 23:29.879
