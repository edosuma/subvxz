00:44.560 --> 00:46.084
Take them down!

00:55.885 --> 00:56.885
Kahlan!

01:17.535 --> 01:18.576
Shoot her!

01:40.659 --> 01:41.891
Hold on, Dennee!

01:42.450 --> 01:43.600
Stay with me!

01:43.892 --> 01:45.342
We're almost there!

02:03.307 --> 02:04.307
Dennee!

02:18.412 --> 02:19.412
Dennee.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
Take it.

02:27.076 --> 02:28.151
Take the Book.

02:29.328 --> 02:30.328
Find him.

02:34.012 --> 02:36.062
This is more important than me.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.350
You know that.

02:40.447 --> 02:41.697
Please, Kahlan.

02:46.344 --> 02:49.608
May the Spirits protect you,
little sister.

02:51.573 --> 02:52.573
Kahlan.

02:57.074 --> 02:58.074
Go.

03:41.714 --> 03:44.012
You've reached the Boundary, Confessor.

03:45.287 --> 03:47.230
There is nowhere else to run.

03:58.801 --> 03:59.851
Steady, boy.

04:05.491 --> 04:06.710
She's got magic!

04:16.767 --> 04:18.594
Ride to the garrison at Kaldrith.

04:19.344 --> 04:20.928
Send word to Lord Rahl:

04:21.797 --> 04:24.647
the Confessor has broken
through the Boundary.

04:25.148 --> 04:27.877
- Yes, sir.
- You three are coming with me.

04:28.498 --> 04:29.498
But sir...

04:39.764 --> 04:43.080
Sync: michvanilly & Kasius

05:33.234 --> 05:34.350
Hi, Richard.

05:34.851 --> 05:35.851
Jared.

05:36.163 --> 05:38.344
- You're just in time.
- For what?

05:38.464 --> 05:40.133
You can be the first to cross.

05:43.554 --> 05:45.700
Or you can go all the way
to the North Bridge,

05:45.820 --> 05:47.684
but this will save you two hours' walk.

05:50.678 --> 05:51.938
Don't worry. It's safe.

05:53.134 --> 05:54.884
It's not me that's scared.

05:55.178 --> 05:56.192
It's Lanie.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.208
Of course.

06:01.407 --> 06:02.322
Smart cow.

06:02.887 --> 06:05.223
Never cross a bridge
that hasn't been tested.

06:05.343 --> 06:06.369
Come on, boy.

06:16.934 --> 06:19.507
- Lanie has anything to worry about.
- Thanks, Richard.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.751
My best to your father.

06:22.929 --> 06:24.879
- Flynn, come.
- Hungry, boy?

06:25.972 --> 06:27.740
Yeah, me too.
Come on.

07:50.502 --> 07:52.392
- Stay back.
- Shoot her.

07:56.879 --> 07:58.129
Leave her alone.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.816
You're making a mistake, boy.

08:01.767 --> 08:03.417
This girl is dangerous.

08:05.721 --> 08:09.010
Four men against one woman?
I think she's the one in danger.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.121
You don't understand
what you're talking about.

08:13.672 --> 08:15.556
And this is not your fight.

08:16.198 --> 08:17.417
So be smart

08:18.430 --> 08:19.499
and go home.

08:19.954 --> 08:21.509
I'm not going anywhere.

08:25.914 --> 08:26.914
Easy.

08:27.452 --> 08:28.844
Do not let her grasp you.

09:07.571 --> 09:09.121
It's over for you,

09:09.487 --> 09:10.566
Confessor.

09:48.734 --> 09:49.931
These men,

09:52.505 --> 09:54.655
why were they trying to kill you?

09:56.768 --> 09:58.318
Your hand is bleeding.

10:05.578 --> 10:08.693
Let me take you to my father's.
We can dress the wound.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.016
Did I do something wrong?

10:21.226 --> 10:22.226
I'm just...

10:23.677 --> 10:25.211
not used to people touching me.

10:26.118 --> 10:27.146
I'm sorry.

10:29.590 --> 10:30.840
It's all right.

10:43.389 --> 10:44.539
I have to go.

10:47.641 --> 10:48.641
Where?

10:48.761 --> 10:50.764
There's someone I need to find.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.424
Who? Maybe I can help you.

10:52.544 --> 10:54.699
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

10:57.961 --> 11:00.011
Why were these men chasing you?

11:00.391 --> 11:03.082
- You always ask this many questions?
- I just saved your life.

11:03.518 --> 11:05.780
The least you could do is tell me
what happened.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.620
Actually, I saved yours.

11:10.407 --> 11:12.157
When you touched that man,

11:14.046 --> 11:15.303
what did you do to him?

11:21.051 --> 11:22.851
You want to know what I did to that man?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.230
Try and follow me and you'll find out.

12:20.999 --> 12:22.349
Drop the weapons.

12:23.405 --> 12:24.755
I said drop them.

12:26.749 --> 12:27.875
On whose authority?

12:28.372 --> 12:30.984
The Councilor's Guards,
which would be me,

12:34.386 --> 12:35.383
and them.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.686
Now, tell me what happened here.

12:49.557 --> 12:50.897
This Councilor you guard,

12:51.511 --> 12:53.606
is he the ruler of this province?

12:53.726 --> 12:54.527
He is.

12:54.921 --> 12:56.671
Then I will tell my story

12:57.446 --> 12:58.321
to him.

12:59.644 --> 13:01.425
My name is Ranssyn Fane,

13:01.670 --> 13:03.918
a commander of the D'Haran Forces.

13:05.373 --> 13:06.373
D'Hara?

13:07.199 --> 13:08.349
But that's...

13:08.815 --> 13:10.800
I have come from the Midlands.

13:12.476 --> 13:15.326
What other fairy-tales
do you have to tell us?

13:16.287 --> 13:18.093
Forgive our skepticism,

13:18.454 --> 13:21.167
but no one's crossed the Boundary
in hundreds of years.

13:21.287 --> 13:22.837
Not since it went up.

13:23.537 --> 13:24.887
It can't be done.

13:25.102 --> 13:27.352
The woman I'm pursuing found a way.

13:27.664 --> 13:28.914
I followed her.

13:29.911 --> 13:31.479
She killed two of my men.

13:33.273 --> 13:34.525
One woman.

13:35.136 --> 13:36.136
How?

13:37.226 --> 13:38.404
She is a witch.

13:40.289 --> 13:41.439
Come on, Shar.

13:42.286 --> 13:43.286
Come on.

13:45.314 --> 13:46.328
There we go.

13:51.263 --> 13:52.263
There.

14:09.263 --> 14:10.810
You're finished, Richard.

14:11.498 --> 14:13.063
I got you beat in two moves.

14:13.223 --> 14:14.475
- Dad...
- Come on,

14:14.595 --> 14:17.545
let's get the bloodbath over with,
so we can eat.

14:18.075 --> 14:19.698
- Dad.
- Son.

14:21.733 --> 14:22.656
What is it?

14:23.237 --> 14:24.466
What's happened?

14:24.586 --> 14:27.828
Her magic is more powerful
than you could possibly imagine.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.497
She used it to cross
into your territory.

14:31.022 --> 14:32.332
And she had help.

14:32.708 --> 14:35.358
From someone
on this side of the Boundary.

14:36.804 --> 14:38.254
He was wearing this.

14:45.929 --> 14:47.055
You recognize it.

14:48.114 --> 14:49.432
It belongs to my brother.

14:53.055 --> 14:55.188
A poison vine I've never seen before,

14:55.751 --> 14:57.646
that glowing thing in her hand,

14:58.639 --> 15:01.289
what she did to that man
who attacked her,

15:01.689 --> 15:03.072
it was magic, wasn't it?

15:06.472 --> 15:08.104
How is that possible?

15:08.847 --> 15:10.787
There's no magic
this side of the Boundary.

15:10.949 --> 15:14.458
Because, son, she and these men,
they're from the Midlands.

15:16.365 --> 15:18.214
- That can't be right.
- I was a fool

15:18.334 --> 15:20.589
- to think this day would never come.
- What day?

15:20.749 --> 15:22.840
Richard, you know that I love you.

15:23.167 --> 15:24.718
Dad, of course.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.184
That's him.
That's the guy who fell off the cliff.

15:41.304 --> 15:42.736
You have to leave. Now.

15:42.896 --> 15:45.746
- Out the back before they get here.
- Michael and Chase are with him.

15:45.866 --> 15:46.934
They can help.

15:47.054 --> 15:49.075
- Where?
- Blackthorn Hill. Find Zedd.

15:49.364 --> 15:51.619
- That crazy old man?
- Zedd will explain everything.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.094
- He talks to his chickens. Why?
- Tell him I sent you.

15:54.214 --> 15:57.060
He'll know why. Just go.
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

15:57.180 --> 15:58.180
Dad...

16:00.953 --> 16:02.325
You have to go.

16:05.128 --> 16:06.128
Now.

16:18.428 --> 16:20.878
I haven't seen him since breakfast time.

16:24.748 --> 16:27.398
You have any idea
where he might have gone?

16:28.552 --> 16:31.629
This morning, he said
he was gonna work on the new bridge.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.789
Are you sure he didn't come home
during the day,

16:37.370 --> 16:40.120
maybe while you were out
gathering firewood?

16:41.552 --> 16:43.046
I haven't left the house.

16:45.864 --> 16:47.759
Take Commander Fane and find him.

16:49.306 --> 16:51.137
If Richard's in trouble,
I want to help.

16:51.553 --> 16:55.141
- If we all follow a different trail...
- Better if you stay here.

16:55.802 --> 16:57.185
He could still come back

16:58.205 --> 16:59.521
and he may be frightened.

17:00.239 --> 17:02.190
- Or worse.
- What do you mean?

17:02.942 --> 17:05.194
The witch has the power to put him
under her control,

17:05.772 --> 17:07.021
and if she does,

17:07.704 --> 17:11.157
he's gonna need his father here to try
and talk some sense to him.

17:12.820 --> 17:16.171
You should leave some of your men,
in case it goes badly.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.391
Chase, post two men outside.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.961
Take the rest down to the South Bridge.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.616
What is it?

17:31.102 --> 17:34.139
Michael, why are you so quick to believe
a stranger from the Midlands?

17:34.977 --> 17:35.985
Because...

17:36.589 --> 17:38.641
Richard does things without thinking.

17:38.761 --> 17:41.340
He always has,
since he was a little boy.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.815
- And you've always protected him.
- He's my son.

17:44.478 --> 17:45.817
He's your brother.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.529
Please, Michael,

17:49.072 --> 17:52.222
- make sure he doesn't get hurt.
- Of course I will.

17:53.416 --> 17:56.286
But it's my responsibility
to protect the people of this town.

17:57.602 --> 17:58.788
Men have been killed,

17:59.564 --> 18:01.342
and Richard was involved.

18:02.079 --> 18:05.129
Stay here.
If he comes back, bring him to me.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.725
We'll find out what really happened.

18:12.045 --> 18:13.734
It's a bad omen, Clara.

18:16.383 --> 18:19.430
A could in the shape of a horn
from the far east.

18:20.554 --> 18:22.124
I'm betting a month of suppers

18:22.244 --> 18:24.994
it'll bring no good
before the sun comes up.

18:27.654 --> 18:30.416
Don't worry, Clara.
Supper will never be you.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.993
I need your help, Wizard.

18:35.977 --> 18:36.977
Sorry,

18:37.673 --> 18:41.498
I'm as deaf as a peach
and as naked as a baby bird.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.586
What did you say?

18:47.041 --> 18:48.757
I asked the Great Wizard

18:49.367 --> 18:52.045
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander
for his assistance.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.681
I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

18:59.350 --> 19:00.900
There's no confusion.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.375
I had help finding you.

19:15.224 --> 19:17.074
What did I tell you, Clara?

19:18.602 --> 19:20.252
Before the sun comes up.

19:26.771 --> 19:28.378
It was good while it lasted.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.712
Nice

19:30.414 --> 19:32.132
quiet couple of decades.

19:32.594 --> 19:33.986
And now time is up.

19:35.373 --> 19:37.004
Bring me to the Seeker.

19:55.847 --> 19:56.847
You.

20:32.631 --> 20:33.777
His fever's broken.

20:35.217 --> 20:36.696
Now take me to the Seeker.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.118
He's here.

20:42.662 --> 20:43.662
Him?

20:45.115 --> 20:46.373
- But he's...
- What?

20:46.812 --> 20:49.543
Not good enough?
You wanted a Seeker, there he is.

20:50.313 --> 20:53.104
If he's not up to your standards,
that's fine by me.

20:53.224 --> 20:55.351
- Find yourself another.
- Seeker?

20:55.954 --> 20:57.804
What are you talking about?

21:02.537 --> 21:03.764
You never told him?

21:06.137 --> 21:08.102
You were supposed to train him.

21:08.975 --> 21:10.065
Prepare him.

21:10.411 --> 21:12.566
What have you been doing
for the last 20 years?

21:13.536 --> 21:15.345
Letting him catch worms.

21:15.976 --> 21:18.171
Steal apples.
Skin his knees.

21:18.474 --> 21:21.024
Find out what makes his heart
beat faster.

21:21.256 --> 21:24.406
My sister gave her life
to make sure that I got here,

21:24.649 --> 21:27.103
to make sure that I put the Book
in the Seeker's hands,

21:27.223 --> 21:29.553
- and he's catching worms?
- Never knew a great man

21:29.673 --> 21:33.085
- who didn't have dirt under his nails.
- While he's getting his nails dirty,

21:33.308 --> 21:35.984
did it ever occur to you
to give him the slightest inkling

21:36.104 --> 21:39.593
that he is the first true Seeker
in the last thousand years?

21:40.351 --> 21:41.511
He has a destiny.

21:42.453 --> 21:44.722
Who are you to decide a man's destiny?

21:45.162 --> 21:46.850
It's not me.
It's the Prophecy.

21:47.309 --> 21:48.809
Prophecy be damned!

21:48.970 --> 21:51.020
I averted the Prophecy
when I brought him here.

21:51.724 --> 21:54.358
Until you opened up a nice little door
in the Boundary and said,

21:54.519 --> 21:56.601
"Right this way to the Seeker,
ladies and gentlemen."

21:56.721 --> 21:59.612
So it doesn't matter that Darken Rahl
is growing more powerful every day,

22:00.112 --> 22:02.468
that people in the Midlands
are losing their freedom,

22:02.588 --> 22:04.738
- dying by the thousands?
- Stop.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.950
What are you talking about?

22:08.099 --> 22:09.549
And what's a Seeker?

22:14.336 --> 22:16.523
A Seeker is a hero

22:17.125 --> 22:19.549
who arises in a time

22:20.438 --> 22:22.270
of trouble and suffering,

22:22.817 --> 22:26.309
and seeks out evil
and fights it wherever he can.

22:28.998 --> 22:30.945
What does that have to do with me?

22:31.065 --> 22:33.815
If you were so sure
you averted the Prophecy,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.770
that he was gonna live a nice,
peaceful life,

22:37.425 --> 22:39.653
why did you stay near him
all these years?

22:41.333 --> 22:42.953
Tell him the truth.

22:43.755 --> 22:45.205
Tell him who he is.

22:55.880 --> 22:59.860
First you need to know
about a man named Darken Rahl,

23:01.715 --> 23:04.410
if he is a man,
and not some twisted wraith of evil

23:04.530 --> 23:06.762
brought forth from the underworld

23:06.924 --> 23:09.174
to shatter the dreams of humankind.

23:11.512 --> 23:15.096
Twenty-three years ago,
a great prophet spoke on his deathbed

23:15.216 --> 23:17.351
of the birth of a true Seeker.

23:17.766 --> 23:20.208
A child whose destiny would be
to seek out

23:20.328 --> 23:22.445
and kill the greatest evil of all:

23:23.111 --> 23:24.214
Darken Rahl.

23:27.385 --> 23:28.772
And with his last breath,

23:28.892 --> 23:32.442
the prophet named the town
in which the child had been born.

23:34.315 --> 23:36.335
Rahl sent his assassins.

23:44.989 --> 23:46.529
And in one night,

23:46.832 --> 23:49.728
they murdered every first-born son
in Brennidon...

23:53.482 --> 23:55.069
save one.

23:58.297 --> 23:59.857
By the grace of the Spirits,

24:00.018 --> 24:02.670
word of the Prophecy found
its way to me, along with something

24:02.790 --> 24:04.481
Darken Rahl didn't have:

24:05.211 --> 24:06.197
your name.

24:10.576 --> 24:13.814
Your mother gave birth
in the madness of the massacre.

24:14.961 --> 24:16.111
She was young.

24:16.611 --> 24:17.714
She was weak.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.628
Midwife didn't think
she'd last the night.

24:22.332 --> 24:26.056
She was still alive
when I took you from her arms.

24:30.829 --> 24:33.350
She kissed you, blessed you.

24:34.766 --> 24:36.644
My mother died when I was 10.

24:37.814 --> 24:38.821
Here.

24:38.941 --> 24:39.991
In Hartland.

24:42.019 --> 24:43.776
The woman you knew as your mother

24:44.311 --> 24:46.904
raised you and loved you
as if you were her own,

24:47.547 --> 24:49.199
but she did not give birth to you.

24:51.945 --> 24:53.744
I crossed the Boundary

24:54.544 --> 24:55.954
at night, unseen,

24:56.638 --> 24:58.441
with you in my arms.

25:02.653 --> 25:04.219
For weeks I watched,

25:04.508 --> 25:06.886
listened, read the clouds,

25:07.340 --> 25:09.134
and came to know that in all the world

25:09.254 --> 25:12.138
there was no one kinder
than George and Mary Cypher.

25:13.285 --> 25:14.533
I told them your story,

25:14.653 --> 25:17.601
and they took you into their home,
and into their hearts.

25:17.763 --> 25:19.513
If I live to be a thousand years old,

25:19.633 --> 25:22.884
I'll never make a wiser choice
than picking them for the job.

25:27.752 --> 25:28.752
So...

25:29.953 --> 25:32.204
according to this fantasy,

25:33.200 --> 25:34.743
who's my real father?

25:35.747 --> 25:36.745
I don't know.

25:39.249 --> 25:41.499
And if you knew my parents so well,

25:41.722 --> 25:44.504
why didn't I ever see you with them?
Why haven't you talked to me?

25:44.664 --> 25:46.088
I kept myself apart,

25:46.510 --> 25:48.174
close enough to keep watch over you,

25:48.336 --> 25:52.127
but far enough away so that
if Darken Rahl ever found his way to me,

25:52.247 --> 25:55.055
I wouldn't be a blazing arrow
pointing the way to you.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.510
Apparently,
that's what Confessors are for.

26:01.996 --> 26:03.088
Confessors?

26:07.123 --> 26:08.926
An ancient order of women

26:09.363 --> 26:12.282
sworn to find the truth, no matter
how hard people may try to hide it.

26:14.873 --> 26:16.698
And if a Seeker should arise,

26:18.064 --> 26:19.831
to protect him with her life.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.553
My name is Kahlan.

26:26.748 --> 26:28.998
I'm sorry for threatening you today.

26:30.310 --> 26:31.879
You did save my life.

26:36.092 --> 26:38.042
I came here to bring you this.

26:42.130 --> 26:43.021
A book?

26:43.623 --> 26:44.973
Not just any book.

26:45.935 --> 26:48.025
It's The Book of Counted Shadows.

26:49.311 --> 26:51.861
It was written in a time
before remembering.

26:52.686 --> 26:54.699
For a thousand years,
it's been kept safe

26:54.860 --> 26:57.110
in the Wizard's Keep, in Aydindril.

26:57.456 --> 26:59.548
But a month ago,
the armies of Darken Rahl

26:59.668 --> 27:03.118
broke through our last defenses
in an attempt to steal it.

27:03.436 --> 27:04.436
Why?

27:05.061 --> 27:08.534
Because the Book contains
the secrets of power.

27:09.674 --> 27:11.800
And if Darken Rahl gets it,
he will use it

27:12.257 --> 27:14.495
to control every corner of the world,

27:15.099 --> 27:16.763
and we would all become his slaves.

27:22.949 --> 27:24.561
The Prophecy says that the Seeker

27:25.067 --> 27:27.731
will use the Book
in his quest to defeat Rahl.

27:31.047 --> 27:32.089
Read it.

27:43.230 --> 27:47.168
Maybe this Seeker you're looking for
knows this language, but...

27:49.298 --> 27:50.255
I don't.

27:50.591 --> 27:51.591
Try.

28:05.298 --> 28:06.298
"The truth

28:07.686 --> 28:08.959
"of the words

28:09.669 --> 28:11.192
"of The Book of Counted Shadows

28:12.208 --> 28:14.439
can only be ensured by a Confessor."

28:19.779 --> 28:20.779
How...?

28:21.586 --> 28:24.849
Because you are the true Seeker.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.595
That's a good blade you've got there.

28:33.715 --> 28:36.751
I could use a tool like that.
Where did you get it?

28:36.871 --> 28:38.521
Trader from down south.

28:39.241 --> 28:42.097
Led me to believe it was one of a kind,
but you know traders.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.929
- What is it?
- Richard's trail ends here.

28:48.511 --> 28:50.061
How is that possible?

28:50.428 --> 28:52.274
He knows how to mask his trail.

28:54.085 --> 28:55.335
We'll split up.

28:56.009 --> 28:57.406
Cover more ground.

28:59.719 --> 29:01.053
Give him the Sword.

29:01.679 --> 29:02.679
Name him.

29:03.865 --> 29:04.865
What sword?

29:14.097 --> 29:16.095
This is the Sword of Truth.

29:17.179 --> 29:20.081
In anyone else's hands,
this is just a piece of steel.

29:20.866 --> 29:22.653
But in the Seeker's hands,

29:23.007 --> 29:25.417
bestows the power to fight evil.

29:26.616 --> 29:29.283
And with it, you will kill Darken Rahl.

29:32.244 --> 29:35.522
I'm not killing anybody.
I don't even know either of you.

29:35.687 --> 29:37.637
For all I know,
this is some kind of trick.

29:37.757 --> 29:40.407
I'm not a Seeker.
I don't want any book,

29:40.674 --> 29:42.574
- or any sword.
- Calm down, my boy.

29:42.991 --> 29:44.704
I'm not your boy.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.914
My father is George Cypher,
and if any of this were true,

29:48.074 --> 29:50.060
he'd have told me.
Now, get out of my way.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.750
- Richard, wait.
- Let him go.

29:51.870 --> 29:52.870
What?

29:54.298 --> 29:56.630
He needs to find the truth for himself.

29:57.053 --> 29:59.426
Until then, he cannot be named.

30:21.022 --> 30:23.676
Your First Councilor needs more men
on the North Hill.

30:23.796 --> 30:26.546
He said I was to tell you
to join him there.

30:44.373 --> 30:46.180
Tell me where to find your son.

31:34.693 --> 31:35.646
Don't

31:36.262 --> 31:37.278
make

31:38.207 --> 31:39.381
a sound.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.663
What was that thing?

32:47.358 --> 32:48.358
A Gar.

32:48.856 --> 32:50.987
It uses the blood flies
to sniff out its prey.

32:51.107 --> 32:53.905
Apparently, D'Haran soldiers weren't
the only thing that followed you

32:54.025 --> 32:55.575
through the Boundary.

32:56.070 --> 32:57.620
What did you do to it?

32:58.045 --> 32:59.250
Wizard's fire.

33:00.100 --> 33:03.050
Wasn't sure I had it in me
after all these years.

33:04.813 --> 33:06.945
- What are you doing?
- Going to find my father

33:07.065 --> 33:09.314
before something horrible
happens to him too.

33:09.434 --> 33:11.367
- We'll go together.
- No.

33:11.561 --> 33:13.535
Stay away from me, both of you.

33:15.625 --> 33:17.623
He's got the Sword and the Book.

33:18.061 --> 33:20.611
Well, isn't that exactly
what you wanted?

33:54.655 --> 33:55.745
I'm gonna get you.

34:13.554 --> 34:14.647
Who did this?

34:16.710 --> 34:17.684
The D'Haran,

34:18.799 --> 34:20.178
Ranssyn Fane.

34:21.562 --> 34:23.225
- I'll take you to Zedd's.
- No.

34:23.344 --> 34:25.016
- He has potions.
- No.

34:26.222 --> 34:28.152
Fane is looking for you there.

34:30.063 --> 34:31.909
You can't go back to Zedd's.

34:37.081 --> 34:38.331
Zedd told me...

34:41.337 --> 34:42.791
He said you're not my father.

34:43.627 --> 34:45.842
Of course I'm your father.

34:47.928 --> 34:49.172
Then it was a lie.

34:53.902 --> 34:56.242
Every word he told you is true.

35:01.085 --> 35:03.104
But I will always be

35:03.701 --> 35:04.939
your father.

35:26.085 --> 35:27.085
Dad?

35:50.184 --> 35:51.200
Richard.

35:52.525 --> 35:53.737
We saw the smoke.

35:55.275 --> 35:56.281
What happened?

35:57.401 --> 35:58.401
He's dead.

36:15.943 --> 36:17.993
Did the witch make you do this?

36:18.267 --> 36:21.473
- Michael, you can't possibly believe...
- I don't know what to believe!

36:22.796 --> 36:23.975
It was Ranssyn Fane.

36:24.890 --> 36:27.979
- He's with Chase looking for you.
- Well, he came back!

36:29.636 --> 36:31.275
That sword.
Where did you get it?

36:33.252 --> 36:35.275
Richard, where have you been?

36:35.649 --> 36:37.699
Michael, he murdered our father.

36:38.425 --> 36:39.923
Not our father.

36:40.575 --> 36:41.869
My father.

36:45.870 --> 36:46.911
You knew.

36:50.326 --> 36:51.892
Why didn't you tell me?

36:52.012 --> 36:54.762
Because he made me swear
that I never would.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.217
But now he's dead.

36:58.387 --> 37:00.537
Did he tell you where I came from?

37:03.637 --> 37:05.487
But I'm beginning to wonder.

37:05.607 --> 37:08.018
And until I find out,
you're not going anywhere.

37:08.138 --> 37:09.138
Take him.

37:13.270 --> 37:14.270
Stay back!

37:17.201 --> 37:18.201
Witchcraft.

37:18.736 --> 37:19.782
Fane was right.

37:34.473 --> 37:36.850
Where are you going
in such a hurry, boy?

37:37.708 --> 37:40.469
I'm going back to your house
to find Fane.

37:41.062 --> 37:42.612
He murdered my father.

37:47.626 --> 37:48.686
I am so sorry.

37:49.846 --> 37:51.196
Get out of my way.

37:52.808 --> 37:54.317
I understand your pain.

37:58.690 --> 37:59.900
Richard Cypher,

38:00.107 --> 38:01.841
you were meant for more than revenge.

38:01.961 --> 38:03.745
You think I care what you say, old man?

38:03.865 --> 38:05.869
- I'm going to kill him!
- And if you fail,

38:06.734 --> 38:07.914
and he kills you?

38:08.075 --> 38:11.080
You said this Sword would give me
the power to fight evil.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.098
In the service of freedom and justice,
not your own rage.

38:14.218 --> 38:17.423
- You're not ready to use the Sword.
- I said get out of my way!

38:17.804 --> 38:18.804
Come on!

39:52.034 --> 39:55.145
Tell me where the witch is
or I'll run you through.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.514
I'll never help you.

40:02.358 --> 40:06.459
I don't know what lies
that witch has put into your head,

40:07.543 --> 40:09.016
but ask yourself:

40:09.622 --> 40:12.246
Are you really prepared to die
for someone you don't even know?

40:15.220 --> 40:16.970
She didn't kill my father.

40:21.410 --> 40:22.410
You did.

41:07.643 --> 41:09.293
Beg for your life, boy!

41:09.922 --> 41:10.888
Do it!

41:14.388 --> 41:16.382
Just like your father did.

41:26.341 --> 41:27.370
The Book.

41:28.062 --> 41:29.992
You brought me the Book.

41:55.125 --> 41:56.100
Fane!

41:57.636 --> 41:58.971
I'm gonna kill you!

42:00.889 --> 42:02.335
You're gonna die!

42:17.334 --> 42:18.334
The Book.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.042
Fane has it.

42:30.584 --> 42:31.834
Then we failed.

42:32.223 --> 42:33.303
No, I failed.

42:35.728 --> 42:36.844
Not yet.

42:37.884 --> 42:40.487
Fane still has to cross the Boundary
to get the Book to Rahl.

42:40.607 --> 42:42.980
- We can still stop him.
- Don't you get it?

42:43.653 --> 42:45.608
I'm not what you want me to be.

42:47.147 --> 42:48.789
Maybe all those years ago,

42:48.909 --> 42:50.012
you saved

42:50.132 --> 42:52.239
the wrong child.

43:05.267 --> 43:07.629
You are the true Seeker.

43:10.068 --> 43:12.342
If anybody failed, it was me,
telling myself

43:12.686 --> 43:14.536
this storm will never come.

43:15.256 --> 43:16.388
Kahlan was right.

43:17.008 --> 43:18.858
I should have prepared you.

43:21.483 --> 43:24.188
What happened to your father
is only the beginning of Rahl's evil.

43:25.343 --> 43:26.893
But you can stop him.

43:27.409 --> 43:28.768
You and only you.

43:32.653 --> 43:33.614
How?

43:34.972 --> 43:36.915
In this life, we cannot go back.

43:37.167 --> 43:38.160
Only forward.

43:40.124 --> 43:43.150
You have a great destiny ahead of you,
Richard Cypher,

43:44.476 --> 43:46.825
if you're willing to accept it.

43:50.855 --> 43:52.362
I've lost everything.

43:52.482 --> 43:53.701
Not everything.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.011
You have me.

43:56.131 --> 43:57.252
And Kahlan.

43:57.651 --> 44:00.140
And most importantly,
you have yourself.

44:00.695 --> 44:03.298
Everything your father
brought you up to be.

44:04.452 --> 44:06.115
And if you stop Rahl,

44:07.726 --> 44:10.191
then your father and Kahlan's sister

44:11.770 --> 44:13.620
won't have died for nothing.

44:25.422 --> 44:26.641
Teach me.

44:43.834 --> 44:45.323
Richard Cypher,

44:46.717 --> 44:49.967
though your road will be long
and the outcome unknown,

44:50.149 --> 44:52.199
will you undertake this journey?

44:52.923 --> 44:53.736
I will.

44:54.452 --> 44:57.281
Will you leave behind your friends
and all that you have known?

45:00.309 --> 45:01.309
I will.

45:02.017 --> 45:04.992
Though the forces of evil have sworn
to bring about your death,

45:05.112 --> 45:06.790
still will you go on?

45:12.556 --> 45:13.556
I will.

45:26.325 --> 45:27.773
Then will you accept

45:28.568 --> 45:30.481
a name of the Seeker?

45:37.848 --> 45:38.848
I will.

45:51.234 --> 45:53.552
Then I, First Wizard

45:54.414 --> 45:59.927
Zeddicus
Zu'l Zorander so name you.

46:31.781 --> 46:32.810
Lord Rahl?

46:33.507 --> 46:35.712
What is it?
What's wrong?

46:37.782 --> 46:38.757
The Seeker.

46:40.729 --> 46:41.729
He lives.

46:48.986 --> 46:50.292
Here's the river.

46:50.431 --> 46:53.718
Fane went east
towards the Boundary, here.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.858
How will we catch up
without a bridge to cross?

46:56.018 --> 46:59.153
There used to be another bridge
south of here, but it washed away.

46:59.733 --> 47:00.696
I rebuilt it.

47:01.071 --> 47:02.739
So we'll cross here,

47:03.223 --> 47:05.533
and we'll double back
and pick up his trail, there.

47:05.653 --> 47:08.579
- Fane is on a fast horse.
- He doesn't know these woods like I do.

47:08.739 --> 47:11.089
And he can't travel fast,
especially at night.

47:11.353 --> 47:13.968
You could know every tree by name
and he's still have a long lead.

47:14.930 --> 47:18.005
On his way to a boundary
that he has no way of crossing.

47:20.229 --> 47:21.884
Then he must believe he can find a way.

47:24.973 --> 47:27.694
Then why are we still
standing here talking?

47:33.245 --> 47:36.774
- Put your sword down{\, Richard}.
- I don't want to fight you, {\Chase, }but I will.

47:38.068 --> 47:40.492
I've known you since
you were crawling on all fours.

47:42.230 --> 47:45.240
Whose side do you think I'm on?
I want to help you,

47:46.382 --> 47:50.621
but first, you need to tell me what
in the name of the Spirits is going on?

47:52.496 --> 47:55.568
I've been so grateful
to you all these years, Fraden.

47:56.376 --> 47:59.401
I believed you had done
more for me than anyone,

47:59.701 --> 48:01.760
and I rewarded you accordingly.

48:02.023 --> 48:04.344
You've been very generous, Lord Rahl.

48:04.850 --> 48:07.830
But now I find that you have failed me.

48:08.033 --> 48:09.890
No, My Lord,
I did exactly as you commanded.

48:10.050 --> 48:12.684
My men and I killed every
first-born son in Brennidon.

48:13.486 --> 48:15.229
Except the one that mattered.

48:17.247 --> 48:19.775
You let him slip through your fingers.

48:21.792 --> 48:24.072
Is it possible My Lord is mistaken?

48:24.192 --> 48:27.831
For 23 years I have slept in peace,

48:27.951 --> 48:29.826
certain that I'd averted the Prophecy.

48:30.885 --> 48:32.496
But then, tonight,

48:32.861 --> 48:34.888
it came to me in a terrible dream.

48:36.509 --> 48:39.148
I saw him take the Sword.

48:40.253 --> 48:41.880
There's no mistake.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.216
The Seeker has been named.

48:44.693 --> 48:46.852
Then let me assemble my men.

48:46.972 --> 48:51.209
- I'll find him and complete the task.
- And how will you do that?

48:52.126 --> 48:53.657
The Seeker is a thousand leagues

48:53.777 --> 48:56.282
from here, on the other side
of the Boundary.

48:56.402 --> 48:59.064
Will your weary old bones
carry you that far?

49:00.903 --> 49:02.184
Do you have a way across?

49:02.554 --> 49:05.112
If this Confessor
found a way, so can we.

49:07.224 --> 49:10.450
I appreciate the sentiment, old friend,

49:11.533 --> 49:14.454
but it's time to let younger men
take up the cause.

49:15.750 --> 49:17.168
As My Lord wishes.

49:18.791 --> 49:20.168
Give me your hand.

49:25.927 --> 49:29.386
Thank you
for your many years of service.

49:50.412 --> 49:52.910
Bring me my Journey Book.

49:58.081 --> 50:00.334
Orders from Lord Rahl:

50:00.494 --> 50:03.837
"Assemble our most powerful sorcerers.

50:04.415 --> 50:09.026
"Deploy them with artillery batteries
at intervals along the border.

50:09.925 --> 50:13.930
"They will use their magic
to penetrate the Boundary.

50:14.335 --> 50:15.906
"Once through,

50:16.312 --> 50:19.516
"our soldiers are to find the Seeker

50:21.088 --> 50:22.243
"and kill him."

50:22.456 --> 50:25.739
So you are supposed
to kill this Darken Rahl.

50:26.458 --> 50:27.819
They say it's my destiny.

50:28.496 --> 50:31.942
But to fulfill that destiny,
he needs The Book of Counted Shadows.

50:32.734 --> 50:36.006
The secrets of power
are written in its pages.

50:36.306 --> 50:39.456
If Darken Rahl learns them, then
we won't be able to defeat him.

50:40.121 --> 50:43.460
That's why we have to find Fane
before he gets the Book to Rahl.

50:45.165 --> 50:47.466
I know. It sounds crazy.

50:54.002 --> 50:56.515
I always knew you were meant
for more than just clearing trails.

50:57.154 --> 51:00.310
You believe us?
You'll help us find Fane?

51:00.688 --> 51:04.231
Well, how can I say no to...
What do you call it? The Seeker?

51:05.459 --> 51:07.993
An inexperienced, untrained Seeker.

51:08.113 --> 51:10.162
- We need to go now.
- You need to rest.

51:10.282 --> 51:13.404
Food. Fresh horses.
It's a day's ride to the Boundary.

51:13.524 --> 51:15.742
Plenty of time to catch up.
We'll leave again first light.

51:16.240 --> 51:19.121
No, that's three hours away.
Kahlan's right. We have to go now.

51:19.281 --> 51:21.116
Listen to your friend, Richard.

51:21.236 --> 51:24.835
Your trouble started when you rushed
in to help Kahlan without thinking.

51:25.478 --> 51:27.181
Lesson Number One, Seeker:

51:27.464 --> 51:30.215
Sometimes to gain ground
you need to slow down.

51:32.640 --> 51:36.179
- That doesn't make sense.
- Never expect sense from a Wizard.

51:36.494 --> 51:38.080
Especially a hungry one.

51:38.759 --> 51:41.855
- I'm not good on an empty stomach.
- Well, you're in luck.

51:41.975 --> 51:44.771
My wife makes
the best spice soup in Hartland.

51:50.152 --> 51:51.153
Delicious.

51:51.899 --> 51:53.488
I'm so glad you like it.

51:53.834 --> 51:57.159
So, what do you think? It was a little
loose around the shoulders,

51:57.665 --> 51:59.074
but I fixed it.

51:59.613 --> 52:02.281
A needle and thread big enough,
she could mend the world.

52:04.485 --> 52:06.290
Mom, are they married?

52:07.944 --> 52:11.131
She wants to know
if you two are married.

52:12.921 --> 52:16.015
- No. We're just...
- Traveling together.

52:16.688 --> 52:17.688
Children.

52:21.705 --> 52:25.771
You have a lovely family.
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

52:27.050 --> 52:28.584
Would you excuse me?

52:47.026 --> 52:48.412
Are you all right?

52:49.179 --> 52:50.837
I miss my family.

52:53.338 --> 52:55.428
With any luck, you'll see 'em soon.

52:56.856 --> 52:58.701
My parents are both gone.

52:58.924 --> 53:00.383
My sister was the last.

53:01.650 --> 53:03.221
Just me now.

53:03.687 --> 53:05.185
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

53:09.135 --> 53:11.858
It's not easy losing
the people you love.

53:22.615 --> 53:25.650
That's the magic you used to find Zedd.

53:25.770 --> 53:27.721
And get through the Boundary.

53:29.292 --> 53:30.711
What is it?

53:32.117 --> 53:33.160
Not what.

53:34.224 --> 53:35.224
Who.

53:37.421 --> 53:39.480
Shar is a Night Wisp.

53:40.255 --> 53:43.181
She got me through the Boundary
and led me to Zedd.

53:45.792 --> 53:47.811
Her people live in the forests
of the Midlands.

53:49.917 --> 53:51.398
She's talking to you.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.244
What's she saying?

53:55.761 --> 53:57.269
She's thanking you.

53:58.795 --> 53:59.799
For what?

54:01.821 --> 54:03.554
I let Fane get away with the Book.

54:07.349 --> 54:09.457
But you also accepted the name Seeker,

54:10.017 --> 54:11.510
and took the Sword.

54:18.658 --> 54:21.488
Shar says,
for the first time she can remember,

54:22.607 --> 54:24.735
her people have a reason to hope.

54:29.642 --> 54:31.340
I'll try not to let her down.

54:42.162 --> 54:43.845
What was that?

54:46.154 --> 54:47.154
Ready.

54:47.447 --> 54:48.447
Fire!

54:55.310 --> 54:57.562
There were strange lights in the sky,

54:57.682 --> 55:01.176
and then the beasts came through,
and killed them all.

55:02.784 --> 55:06.848
- Please, everyone stay calm.
- How can you tell us to say calm?

55:07.233 --> 55:10.203
What if it's my son next time
and not an animal?

55:16.741 --> 55:18.068
You have a problem.

55:18.870 --> 55:21.571
And a few dead cattle
are only the beginning.

55:25.907 --> 55:29.264
- What do you want?
- Those flashes in the sky,

55:29.834 --> 55:33.337
the creatures eating your livestock,
they all indicate one thing:

55:34.036 --> 55:37.212
The man I serve, Lord Darken Rahl,
is trying to bring down the Boundary.

55:40.301 --> 55:43.468
- And how will he do that?
- He has legions at his command,

55:43.785 --> 55:46.554
powerful magic at his disposal.

55:46.838 --> 55:49.695
The treaty has stood
for hundreds of years.

55:50.070 --> 55:52.102
- Why?
- Because

55:52.522 --> 55:53.905
he wants this.

55:54.853 --> 55:57.137
- A book?
- The witch stole it from Lord Rahl

55:57.257 --> 55:59.067
and he will stop at nothing
to get it back.

55:59.692 --> 56:01.375
When he comes through the Boundary,

56:01.578 --> 56:04.155
he will deal harshly with anyone
who has come between him

56:04.893 --> 56:06.366
and what is rightfully his.

56:08.428 --> 56:11.955
I've done nothing to offend this man.
Why are you telling me this?

56:16.305 --> 56:19.087
Lord Rahl
is a great leader.

56:19.610 --> 56:21.809
He will richly reward
any ruler wise enough

56:21.929 --> 56:23.846
to ally himself with the House of Rahl.

56:28.966 --> 56:31.278
- What are you asking me to do?
- I cannot wait for Lord Rahl

56:31.398 --> 56:33.821
to bring down the Boundary.
I need to get through now.

56:33.941 --> 56:36.896
- I have no way to help you do that.
- The people that are pursuing me

56:37.016 --> 56:39.993
- would kill me to get this book.
- Powerful adversaries.

56:42.324 --> 56:43.324
My brother.

56:45.773 --> 56:49.617
He ceased to be your brother the moment
the witch put him under her spell.

56:50.152 --> 56:53.623
The same witch who is responsible
for your father's death.

56:56.859 --> 57:00.770
I need an armed escort,
and I need my pursuers stopped.

57:03.728 --> 57:06.274
The world is changing, Councilor.

57:06.692 --> 57:10.638
And one way or another, Lord Rahl will
have the Westlands under his dominion,

57:11.150 --> 57:15.037
as he has the provinces
of the Midlands and D'Hara beyond.

57:16.569 --> 57:18.617
What you need to ask yourself

57:19.579 --> 57:22.144
is will you be on
the side of righteousness,

57:23.202 --> 57:24.861
or will you be against it?

57:44.824 --> 57:45.965
None of that, boy.

57:48.387 --> 57:50.929
- What?
- I see the way you're lookin' at her.

57:52.488 --> 57:54.796
- What you're talking about?
- You think because I'm old

57:54.916 --> 57:57.114
I don't remember
what it's like to get my britches

57:57.234 --> 57:58.901
in a bunch over a beautiful woman?

57:59.021 --> 58:02.399
- My britches are not in a bunch.
- Bunched britches, lurching loins,

58:02.519 --> 58:05.318
hot haunches, call it what you want.
It can never be.

58:05.946 --> 58:07.004
Not with her.

58:11.093 --> 58:13.543
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because you need to concentrate

58:13.663 --> 58:16.973
on finding Fane.
Keep your eyes on the trail up ahead,

58:17.879 --> 58:19.541
not on her posterior.

58:21.035 --> 58:22.826
Lesson Number Two, Seeker:

58:23.053 --> 58:26.172
Clear your mind of what was and will be.
See only the task that is.

58:27.245 --> 58:28.424
Let's ride.

59:05.580 --> 59:09.966
Surrender your weapons
and come with us, or we kill the witch.

59:16.327 --> 59:17.803
Richard, no.

59:22.138 --> 59:23.716
What are you doing, Michael?

59:24.183 --> 59:26.900
Protecting the people
of this town from magic.

59:27.708 --> 59:30.737
- Get the witch!
- She's not a witch.

59:30.897 --> 59:33.990
Until she came,
this was a peaceful place to live.

59:35.511 --> 59:37.327
Now she's turned my brother against me.

59:37.573 --> 59:40.142
My father has been murdered.

59:40.262 --> 59:42.290
She's brought death to our homes!

59:44.791 --> 59:47.481
People, please,
put down your weapons and listen!

59:48.376 --> 59:50.048
Patrick, you've known
me my whole life.

59:50.208 --> 59:52.550
I helped your son get
your cow home just yesterday.

59:52.710 --> 59:54.956
That herd is gone, because of her!

59:57.575 --> 59:58.389
Kill her!

59:58.672 --> 59:59.672
Yes!

01:00:06.706 --> 01:00:07.398
No!

01:00:12.897 --> 01:00:13.947
Back off!

01:00:49.267 --> 01:00:50.191
Are you okay?

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:55.530
Has everyone in Hartland
lost their minds?

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:57.033
People are afraid.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:01:01.196
- They're looking for someone to blame.
- Wizard's First Rule:

01:01:01.517 --> 01:01:04.469
People will believe a lie
because they want it to be true,

01:01:05.043 --> 01:01:07.875
or because they're afraid
it might be true.

01:01:10.037 --> 01:01:11.037
Chase,

01:01:12.124 --> 01:01:15.937
if my own brother can turn against me,
and people know you're with me...

01:01:16.914 --> 01:01:18.052
Go home.

01:01:18.838 --> 01:01:20.596
Make sure your family is safe.

01:01:22.857 --> 01:01:24.388
Go.
I'll catch up when I can.

01:01:24.658 --> 01:01:25.642
Okay.

01:01:31.642 --> 01:01:32.663
What is it?

01:01:33.686 --> 01:01:35.028
It's Shar.

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:38.323
Destroying that arrow
drained her of her light.

01:01:38.977 --> 01:01:41.701
- We have to help her.
- It's too late.

01:01:42.529 --> 01:01:44.120
She's dying.

01:01:54.685 --> 01:01:57.836
May the Spirits light your way
through the land of the shadow

01:01:57.956 --> 01:02:00.180
to the halls of eternal peace.

01:02:12.191 --> 01:02:14.436
She died saving me from that arrow.

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:18.654
And she was your way home.

01:02:21.567 --> 01:02:23.117
I'm so sorry.

01:02:23.277 --> 01:02:26.162
She sacrificed herself
to protect the Seeker.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.373
We would both do the same.

01:02:30.411 --> 01:02:33.578
Shar didn't even know me,
and neither do you.

01:02:34.402 --> 01:02:36.881
But we know how important
your mission is.

01:02:42.254 --> 01:02:45.681
Then I will try and make sure
Shar didn't die for nothing.

01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:47.963
Let's start with finding Fane.

01:02:49.147 --> 01:02:51.604
He knows he can't get through
the Boundary without magic either,

01:02:51.764 --> 01:02:53.800
but he didn't try to take Shar from us.

01:02:54.434 --> 01:02:56.329
What does that tell you, Seeker?

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:59.112
He must have another way to get across.

01:03:11.072 --> 01:03:14.210
Tell me what you're doing at my house,
gentlemen, and I may let you live.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:15.710
You're wanted inside.

01:03:17.915 --> 01:03:18.797
Emma?

01:03:26.358 --> 01:03:27.557
Let her go.

01:03:29.188 --> 01:03:31.894
Drop your weapons
or I will cut her throat.

01:03:43.638 --> 01:03:45.116
Tell me what you want.

01:03:46.211 --> 01:03:47.618
That's a D'Haran battle weapon,

01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:51.493
standard issue as of last year,

01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:54.072
which means it did not
come to the Westlands

01:03:54.192 --> 01:03:56.309
before the Boundary went up.
You...

01:03:57.215 --> 01:03:58.584
know a way through.

01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:02.216
I told you, I bought it from a trader.
I have no idea where she got it.

01:04:02.541 --> 01:04:05.386
You think I'd lie to you
when you've got my daughter?

01:04:07.121 --> 01:04:10.725
Let her go, Fane, and I will tell you
where to find the trader.

01:04:11.153 --> 01:04:14.862
And what if you send me
into the clutches of the witch instead?

01:04:17.679 --> 01:04:18.814
Let Laura go

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.986
and I will take you there myself.

01:04:22.756 --> 01:04:23.756
I think

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:27.119
- I'll take Laura here.
- No, you don't have to do this.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:29.383
I said I will tell you
where the trader is.

01:04:29.503 --> 01:04:34.165
Yes. And if your information is correct,
I will send her back to you.

01:04:35.254 --> 01:04:36.751
If it is not...

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.042
The woman you are looking for
is called the Bone Lady.

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:12.466
Fane's horse?

01:05:13.923 --> 01:05:15.227
Deer tracks.

01:05:18.686 --> 01:05:22.070
The Boundary goes north and south
as far as anyone has ever traveled.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:24.563
Who knows where he'll try to cross?

01:05:27.846 --> 01:05:29.234
Just like last night.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.379
- What do you think it is?
- It's Darken Rahl,

01:05:33.582 --> 01:05:36.319
looking for a way to get through
the Boundary, maybe even bring it down.

01:05:36.693 --> 01:05:39.230
- Well, that's good news.
- Good news?

01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:41.914
An impatient Rahl is just what we need.

01:05:42.248 --> 01:05:44.549
It means Fane hasn't gotten
across with the Book yet.

01:05:44.669 --> 01:05:46.809
There's still time to stop him.

01:05:46.929 --> 01:05:49.699
The Boundary's been up for centuries.
How could Rahl just bring it down?

01:05:49.955 --> 01:05:53.051
I don't know, exactly.
But he has more than just his own magic.

01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:56.038
He has sorcerers and wizards
that are loyal to him.

01:05:57.467 --> 01:05:59.059
We're not all on the side of good.

01:05:59.179 --> 01:06:02.748
And more than magic, he has thousands
of soldiers under his command.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.480
And I'm supposed to kill him?

01:06:04.722 --> 01:06:05.423
Alone?

01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:07.941
What do we look like, boy,
grilled sardines?

01:06:08.061 --> 01:06:09.816
Besides, you have the Sword.

01:06:10.479 --> 01:06:12.992
One sword against an army?

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.938
Not just any sword.

01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:19.047
It holds the strength of all the ancient
Seekers who wielded it before you.

01:06:19.167 --> 01:06:23.100
People will rise up and follow you
when they know the Seeker has returned.

01:06:24.185 --> 01:06:25.762
Lesson Number Three:

01:06:26.506 --> 01:06:30.873
Though the Seeker may battle alone,
he fights with the strength of many.

01:06:32.372 --> 01:06:33.701
Two against one.

01:06:33.861 --> 01:06:36.744
- The odds aren't fair.
- We're not gonna fight you, Brandstone.

01:06:36.864 --> 01:06:39.826
- Taking you to see the First Councilor.
- And so what is he paying you

01:06:39.946 --> 01:06:42.525
- to betray a fellow Westlander?
- We're just following orders.

01:06:42.645 --> 01:06:45.291
Those orders included letting
a killer abduct my daughter?

01:06:47.276 --> 01:06:51.033
Those odds I was talking about,
there weren't fair... to you!

01:07:09.123 --> 01:07:11.043
What news from the border?

01:07:11.163 --> 01:07:14.867
The assault continues, My Lord.
The Boundary appears to be weakening.

01:07:15.395 --> 01:07:16.118
Ready.

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:17.411
Fire!

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:25.625
I'm okay.

01:07:26.901 --> 01:07:30.549
Whatever Rahl is doing is working.
The Boundary is getting weaker.

01:07:32.139 --> 01:07:34.095
Did you hear that?
Who's there?

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.888
Don't listen to them, boy.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.477
- Who are they?
- Shadow People.

01:07:41.637 --> 01:07:43.479
It's the souls of the dead.

01:07:43.639 --> 01:07:46.341
It's said they can travel into
the Boundary from the underworld.

01:07:50.348 --> 01:07:54.077
- They're talking to me.
- Come back. Come home to us.

01:07:55.498 --> 01:07:58.788
I miss you.
I want to see you again.

01:08:00.489 --> 01:08:03.072
- Mom?
- I'm here, Richard.

01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:07.086
They're not real, son. It's a trick!
They'll drag you into the underworld!

01:08:07.246 --> 01:08:08.169
{\Richard, }Don't!

01:08:10.916 --> 01:08:12.550
- Mom, I'm here.
- Stop!

01:08:34.587 --> 01:08:36.991
- How is he?
- His breathing is getting weaker.

01:08:38.442 --> 01:08:42.309
- We have to take him to a healer.
- We have to find Fane and get the Book.

01:08:42.429 --> 01:08:45.569
Yeah, {\well, }we're not gonna
catch up dragging Zedd behind us.

01:08:47.314 --> 01:08:48.335
Then we won't.

01:08:50.786 --> 01:08:53.714
- We can't just leave him here.
- You heard what he said.

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:55.301
He's willing to die for you.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.862
And how many more people
are gonna die because of me?

01:09:00.252 --> 01:09:01.474
I don't know.

01:09:02.281 --> 01:09:03.392
Maybe many.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.256
But you'll save many more.

01:09:08.081 --> 01:09:09.582
Free them from Rahl.

01:09:10.524 --> 01:09:12.542
If I just hadn't listened
to these voices...

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.479
When I went through the Boundary,

01:09:17.176 --> 01:09:19.117
I heard my mother calling to me.

01:09:19.237 --> 01:09:21.250
I wanted so badly to go with her.

01:09:22.633 --> 01:09:23.960
But I didn't.

01:09:24.612 --> 01:09:25.830
What stopped you?

01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:28.209
I knew I had to find you

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:33.051
Darken Rahl has the power
to speak to the dead.

01:09:33.365 --> 01:09:36.095
Maybe he was using
the Spirits to trap us,

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:38.344
to stop us from doing what we have to.

01:09:38.504 --> 01:09:39.761
We can't let him.

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:44.234
You stay with Zedd.

01:09:46.197 --> 01:09:49.893
I'll find Fane and the Book,
and I'll come back for you.

01:09:50.013 --> 01:09:52.578
You can't go alone. It's too dangerous.

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:54.610
My destiny.
My decision.

01:09:58.587 --> 01:10:00.524
- What happened?
- Fane has my daughter.

01:10:00.644 --> 01:10:04.106
He's taken her to the Bone
Lady in South Haven. We have to go now.

01:10:04.226 --> 01:10:06.202
You do with him.
I'll follow with Zedd.

01:10:13.415 --> 01:10:15.432
Where are you hiding the Night Wisp?

01:10:17.777 --> 01:10:20.386
- Adie don't have no Night Wisp.
- Don't lie to me.

01:10:20.726 --> 01:10:24.154
I've seen the scythe you traded
with Brandstone, the Councilor's Guard.

01:10:24.274 --> 01:10:27.848
- Adie don't know this man.
- Let me introduce you

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:30.317
to his daughter.

01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:33.366
Now, I want you to feel that nice

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.417
warm skin.

01:10:36.535 --> 01:10:39.196
Well, in a minute,
it's going to be cold and dead

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.682
if you don't give me what I want!

01:10:43.288 --> 01:10:44.535
Please, Miss Adie,

01:10:45.901 --> 01:10:47.437
do what he says.

01:11:00.377 --> 01:11:03.134
- A rock?
- Not a rock.

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:07.474
It be a Nightstone.
It hold powerful magic.

01:11:08.721 --> 01:11:11.687
You take it up the South Trail
to the Boundary, it gets you through.

01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:14.874
Now you leave the girl with Adie and go.

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:21.780
The girl is coming with me.

01:12:00.147 --> 01:12:01.147
Run!

01:12:03.567 --> 01:12:04.567
Father!

01:12:38.267 --> 01:12:39.435
Are you hurt?

01:12:40.411 --> 01:12:41.817
Are you all right?

01:12:49.548 --> 01:12:51.086
If I believed in fairy-tales,

01:12:53.859 --> 01:12:57.334
I'd say I just saw my friend,
Richard Cypher, slay a dragon.

01:13:00.971 --> 01:13:01.985
Thank you.

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:15.436
Laura. Thank the Spirits,
you're all right.

01:13:16.026 --> 01:13:17.604
Your Seeker here saved her life.

01:13:22.517 --> 01:13:23.571
How is he?

01:13:24.203 --> 01:13:25.353
He's the same.

01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:35.331
His skin be burning hot.

01:13:35.686 --> 01:13:37.624
This be Shadow poison at work.

01:13:38.069 --> 01:13:40.502
- Can you help him?
- Adie has her ways.

01:13:41.022 --> 01:13:42.772
She will do what she can.

01:13:43.364 --> 01:13:45.374
We'll leave him with you,
and we'll come back

01:13:45.494 --> 01:13:47.384
- after we get the Book.
- We should go.

01:13:47.545 --> 01:13:51.412
From here, Fane has less than an hour
before he gets back to the Boundary.

01:13:51.532 --> 01:13:54.391
And with Adie's Nightstone,
he be able to walk through it.

01:13:54.674 --> 01:13:57.281
- We should hurry.
- No. Chase, you've done enough.

01:13:57.401 --> 01:14:00.105
You get Laura home, you make sure
the rest of your family is safe.

01:14:00.265 --> 01:14:01.357
You need help.

01:14:02.224 --> 01:14:04.174
That's what I have Kahlan for.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.945
And like she said when we first met,

01:14:07.197 --> 01:14:09.147
she can take care of herself.

01:14:11.575 --> 01:14:12.825
If you need me, my friend,

01:14:13.104 --> 01:14:15.829
you send word, and I'll be there
as fast as a horse can take me.

01:14:16.935 --> 01:14:20.236
- It could be a long ride, Chase.
- There's no ride too long.

01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:33.320
Let's find Fane.

01:15:29.378 --> 01:15:31.182
There!
To the south.

01:15:31.675 --> 01:15:33.575
Realign the weapon
and aim for the lights.

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:34.695
Yes, sir!

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:36.933
Fane!

01:15:40.005 --> 01:15:41.248
Give me the Book.

01:15:44.662 --> 01:15:45.585
Kill them.

01:15:47.469 --> 01:15:49.996
I said give me the Book.

01:15:50.585 --> 01:15:53.968
Haven't you learned
your lesson yet, boy?

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:56.012
As a matter of fact, I have.

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:39.792
You did it.

01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:45.159
You are the Seeker.

01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:26.084
The Boundary is open!

01:18:26.573 --> 01:18:27.727
Into the breach!

01:18:27.847 --> 01:18:29.413
Find the Seeker!

01:18:29.701 --> 01:18:30.701
Kill them!

01:18:50.523 --> 01:18:51.563
What do we do?

01:18:52.747 --> 01:18:54.066
We stand and fight.

01:19:01.703 --> 01:19:03.325
The Book of Counted Shadows.

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:07.122
- We can't let them get the Book.
- Stay back!

01:19:10.063 --> 01:19:11.313
Give me the Book

01:19:11.676 --> 01:19:13.733
and I'll give you a merciful death.

01:19:14.738 --> 01:19:17.565
<i>The Book contains the secrets of power.</i>

01:19:18.173 --> 01:19:19.640
<i>And if Darken Rahl gets it,</i>

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.969
<i>he will use it to control
every corner of the world.</i>

01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:34.272
Get the Book!

01:19:43.977 --> 01:19:44.980
Take them!

01:19:47.809 --> 01:19:49.765
<i>Clear your mind
of what was and will be.</i>

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:51.635
<i>See only the task that is.</i>

01:19:56.772 --> 01:19:58.421
<i>Though the Seeker may battle alone,</i>

01:19:58.914 --> 01:20:00.590
<i>he fights with the strength of many.</i>

01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:42.090
Kill them!

01:20:44.244 --> 01:20:45.218
Easy, old man.

01:20:46.897 --> 01:20:49.139
- Who are you?
- Your friends left me to heal you.

01:20:49.585 --> 01:20:51.475
- Where are they?
- On the Boundary.

01:20:51.838 --> 01:20:53.059
I have to go.

01:21:09.327 --> 01:21:10.329
Kahlan!

01:23:32.305 --> 01:23:34.855
That's the second time
you saved my life.

01:24:01.551 --> 01:24:04.084
- Looks like I missed the excitement.
- Zedd.

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.088
You're alive.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.462
Takes more than a little
Shadow poison to kill me, boy.

01:24:10.468 --> 01:24:11.757
He burned the Book.

01:24:12.755 --> 01:24:13.760
I had to.

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:18.160
It was the only way I could see
to keep it from the D'Harans.

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.643
How will he fulfill the Prophecy now?

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:25.459
Sounds to me
like he's already started.

01:24:26.402 --> 01:24:27.565
I don't understand.

01:24:28.667 --> 01:24:31.138
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but doesn't the Prophecy say

01:24:31.258 --> 01:24:34.619
the Seeker will use the Book
in his quest to defeat Darken Rahl?

01:24:36.452 --> 01:24:37.852
He did use the Book,

01:24:38.505 --> 01:24:40.555
just not in the way we expected.

01:24:41.996 --> 01:24:45.691
More important he kept the Book
from getting into Rahl's hands.

01:24:46.836 --> 01:24:49.004
Being the Seeker means
making difficult choices.

01:24:50.308 --> 01:24:52.858
And Richard made the first
of many today.

01:24:53.084 --> 01:24:55.742
What about all the secrets
the Book was said to contain?

01:24:55.862 --> 01:24:58.612
How will he defeat Rahl
without knowing them?

01:24:59.611 --> 01:25:02.299
Well, it appears the Seeker's quest
isn't going to come

01:25:02.419 --> 01:25:04.018
with an instruction manual.

01:25:08.947 --> 01:25:10.154
Where to now?

01:25:11.772 --> 01:25:13.152
The Boundary is open.

01:25:13.594 --> 01:25:15.144
We can go either way.

01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:27.399
Well, like a wise man
once told me,

01:25:28.213 --> 01:25:30.207
"In this life, you can't go back.

01:25:31.314 --> 01:25:32.379
"Only forward."

01:25:33.604 --> 01:25:35.699
Spoken like the true Seeker.

01:25:54.128 --> 01:25:55.128
My Lord,

01:25:55.612 --> 01:25:58.529
one of our sorcerers from the Boundary
has sent news from Kaldrith.

01:25:58.649 --> 01:26:00.825
He was the only survivor
of his artillery battery.

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.205
The only survivor?

01:26:05.636 --> 01:26:06.786
Yes, My Lord.

01:26:07.493 --> 01:26:09.793
They succeeded in
penetrating the Boundary,

01:26:10.414 --> 01:26:12.464
but the Seeker killed them all.

01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:14.109
The Book?

01:26:15.092 --> 01:26:16.542
Destroyed, My Lord.

01:26:22.464 --> 01:26:25.417
It seems the Seeker and I
are on an even footing.

01:26:26.442 --> 01:26:27.461
My Lord,

01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:30.855
the Seeker travels only
with a Wizard and a Confessor.

01:26:31.582 --> 01:26:34.167
You have tens of thousands
of subjects and soldiers

01:26:34.287 --> 01:26:36.437
who will obey your every command.

01:26:39.231 --> 01:26:43.104
Then let it be known
throughout the three territories,

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.157
that whoever brings me the Seeker

01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:49.722
will be rewarded
beyond imagining.

01:26:55.865 --> 01:26:57.778
So where are we going, exactly?

01:26:57.898 --> 01:26:59.505
To find Rahl, of course.

01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:00.634
Won't be easy.

01:27:00.904 --> 01:27:02.914
He moves from palace to palace,

01:27:03.202 --> 01:27:05.729
temple to temple.
His spies are everywhere.

01:27:06.484 --> 01:27:09.158
And it's said he has magic
to cloak his movements

01:27:09.278 --> 01:27:11.228
and disguise his appearances.

01:27:12.014 --> 01:27:13.664
So how will we find him?

01:27:14.323 --> 01:27:16.734
One step at a time, my boy.
One step at a time.

01:27:18.198 --> 01:27:21.397
Because where we don't find Rahl,
we'll find his emissaries,

01:27:21.517 --> 01:27:25.060
and innocent people who need
protection from his dark magic.

01:27:25.474 --> 01:27:28.700
Mark my words, you'll get plenty
of use out of that Sword.

01:27:29.551 --> 01:27:30.701
I'll be ready.

01:27:32.136 --> 01:27:33.386
I have no doubt.
