WEBVTT

00:07.841 --> 00:10.010
Are you kidding me?

00:12.304 --> 00:14.681
Harriet, behave yourself.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.267
It's so purple.

00:17.768 --> 00:21.271
Ordinarily, I'd rather eat
crabgrass than go coat shopping,

00:21.355 --> 00:24.525
but my mother said it was
either a new coat or no coat.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.985
And since I'm allergic to
freezing to death…

00:27.069 --> 00:28.779
You get the picture.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.405
I look like a plum.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.116
Hardly. Plums are sweet.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.035
Try the next one.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.581
Yikes.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.720
Stupid zipper!

00:55.931 --> 00:57.766
Is everything okay in there?

00:57.850 --> 00:59.184
Why don't you ask her?

00:59.268 --> 01:01.061
Get off of me, you coat.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.066
Oh, I'd rather not.

01:09.778 --> 01:13.115
It's trying to kill me.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.700
Maybe I'll help.

01:18.287 --> 01:22.291
My coat future looked bleak
until I saw it.

01:22.916 --> 01:28.922
Color: navy blue. Style: peacoat.
Size: children's medium.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.632
It was perfect!

01:31.133 --> 01:33.427
Little did I know that
wearing it would lead to

01:33.510 --> 01:36.638
dark secrets, fiendish banana splits

01:36.722 --> 01:40.559
and a staring contest to see
who would blink first:

01:40.642 --> 01:43.270
freedom or tyranny.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.523
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

01:46.607 --> 01:48.275
We just wanna be

01:49.401 --> 01:52.237
I am gonna be who I wanna be

01:52.321 --> 01:53.989
My autonomy

01:54.072 --> 01:56.867
No, I won't cut my hair

01:56.950 --> 01:59.494
And I'll wear whatever

01:59.578 --> 02:05.584
I like it when I get to be myself

02:05.667 --> 02:08.211
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

02:08.294 --> 02:11.131
We don't wanna be told what to do

02:18.096 --> 02:20.474
Before we get started on the new coat,

02:20.557 --> 02:22.226
I want you to meet my old coat.

02:24.478 --> 02:28.607
Found this peace button on the 6 train.
Used it to cover a moth hole.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.734
I got lost in Central Park once.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.278
That's where the prickers came from.

02:33.362 --> 02:36.573
Most of the major stains are from
a mustard-related incident

02:36.657 --> 02:39.076
from when I crashed my bike
into a hot dog man.

02:39.993 --> 02:44.498
We've been through a lot together
and I felt guilty about moving on.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.878
I'll never forget you, coat.
Now look away.

02:54.758 --> 02:58.428
-What do you think?
-I still don't know if it's 100% me.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.098
Just give it time.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.977
Goodbye, buddy.

03:08.856 --> 03:12.651
With my old coat,
when I ran fast or made sudden moves,

03:12.734 --> 03:15.487
it made all these loud swish-swish noises.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.825
This coat was silent as a shadow.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.788
Also, when I put up the collar,
I feel like Jack London,

03:24.872 --> 03:27.749
a great writer you should
definitely check out

03:27.833 --> 03:30.961
who went on adventures
in the Great White North.

03:33.922 --> 03:39.094
I told myself that if I could get
the tugboat captain to blow his horn,

03:39.178 --> 03:42.598
then the peacoat would truly be
the coat for me.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.572
By the time I got to school,
I loved my new coat

03:58.655 --> 04:02.075
the way you love
a perfect song or a great book

04:02.159 --> 04:05.287
or a tomato sandwich
sliced diagonally on white bread.

04:05.871 --> 04:06.914
Then, as usual,

04:06.997 --> 04:10.000
Marion Hawthorne ruined everything.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.849
Please tell me that coat
isn't made by Smithers of London.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.936
"Smithers of London."

04:29.019 --> 04:31.063
Smithers of London

04:31.146 --> 04:33.398
You need to take it off. Now.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.695
Why can't you wear something else?
Don't you have, like, 5,000 coats?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.614
This is my only coat.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.284
Oh, Harriet, I'm doing you a favor.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.454
If you wear that, people are just
gonna think you're a copier.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.999
How can I be a copier if I didn't know
you had the same coat?

04:51.083 --> 04:53.836
Well, you knew it was
the kinda coat I would wear.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.089
You act like you don't like me, Harriet,

04:57.172 --> 04:59.341
but I know your dark little secret.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.385
You want to be me.

05:02.845 --> 05:08.809
I bought this coat because it's
totally, absolutely, incredibly--

05:08.892 --> 05:10.269
Me.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.603
Me!

05:11.687 --> 05:15.148
Oh. Well, if you're so sure,
why don't we have a vote?

05:15.732 --> 05:19.611
-A vote?
-Is the coat totally you or totally me?

05:19.695 --> 05:21.530
Why don't we let the class decide?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.824
Winner gets to wear the coat.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.578
Here's a wild idea: we both wear the coat.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.247
So you can be me?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.748
I'm not--

05:31.832 --> 05:34.626
Ever think that maybe
it's you who wants to be me?

05:36.962 --> 05:41.216
I bet you do. I bet you definitely do!

05:41.300 --> 05:42.759
You're the copier.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.724
A coat vote? Why would you agree to that?

05:48.807 --> 05:50.225
What was I supposed to do?

05:50.309 --> 05:53.395
Marion kept saying that
I was trying to be her.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.563
I could win.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.232
But you've never beaten Marion
at anything.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.401
I am aware of that.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.071
You know what? It's just gonna end up
being some dumb popularity contest.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.407
Yeah, for Marion.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.995
But I'm gonna win by proving that
the only person I'm copying is

06:10.078 --> 06:12.539
Harriet M. Welsch.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.209
Get away. Dumb pigeons.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.878
Harriet, with the coat vote looming,

06:17.961 --> 06:21.715
any response to Marion Hawthorne saying
that you're a big copier?

06:21.798 --> 06:22.966
What?

06:23.050 --> 06:27.095
They say imitation is
the sincerest form of flattery.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.889
But in the case of Harriet,

06:28.972 --> 06:32.309
I would be happier
if she stopped trying to be me

06:32.392 --> 06:34.770
and started trying to be herself.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.647
Any questions?

06:39.233 --> 06:40.442
Sorry.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.194
We're on it. Super sorry.

06:43.529 --> 06:47.616
Marion, can you tell us
why your coat is so you?

06:50.452 --> 06:52.246
Need I say more?

06:52.329 --> 06:55.332
So, why is your coat you, dare I ask?

06:55.415 --> 06:58.627
It's me because it has
a secret pocket for my notebook.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.629
It also has extra-deep side pockets,

07:00.712 --> 07:03.674
which are perfect for storing
random junk I find on the street.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.802
They're like a coat pocket museum.

07:07.386 --> 07:12.057
I only have one coat, Marion,
because there's only one coat that's me.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.268
How many coats do you have?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.561
One.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.939
-One?
-I got rid of the rest.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.650
This coat is
a Smithers of London, Harriet.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.235
Smithers of London

07:23.318 --> 07:25.320
My search is over.

07:26.196 --> 07:30.033
-Wow, that's cool.
-Yeah, I know.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.581
"My search is over."

07:36.123 --> 07:38.166
I bet she has a hundred coats.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.170
You're right. We just need proof.

07:41.795 --> 07:46.675
Hey, Harriet. Pinky and I just wanna
let you know that you've got our vote.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.970
We're tired of Marion always
making us feel like goobers.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.221
It wasn't our fault.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.515
Totally out of our control.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.100
Thanks for your votes, guys.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.977
-Harriet, Harriet!
-Spread the word.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.061
Hey, guys.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.737
I've broken down the sixth grade
into groups

08:06.820 --> 08:08.864
so we could see
how people are going to vote.

08:08.947 --> 08:13.118
Sport explained that Marion's
voting bloc is basically two groups.

08:13.202 --> 08:16.038
There's the people who want to be
Marion Hawthorne.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.374
Well, I don't actually wanna be Marion.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.668
She's her and I'm me and--

08:22.169 --> 08:24.755
Okay, I do wanna be Marion.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.842
I would like to be Marion as well.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.347
The other group was the people
who are afraid of Marion Hawthorne.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.017
I'm scared of her, sure,
but not as scared as those guys.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.066
Down here, we've got
the voters who might vote for you.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.528
There was the new kid
who doesn't know anything.

08:47.611 --> 08:48.987
Sorry, what's happening?

08:49.071 --> 08:51.448
Then there was the people who don't care

08:51.532 --> 08:53.909
because a coat vote, whatever that is,
seems dumb.

08:53.992 --> 08:58.205
A coat is a coat. It's cold,
you put it on, you're warm. End of story.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.291
Finally, there were
the kids with nothing to lose.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.584
Deal with it.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.547
What about Beth Ellen?

09:06.630 --> 09:08.131
She always looks sad.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.593
-I bet we could get her on our side.
-Yeah, that would be great.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.221
She must know how many coats
Marion really has.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.557
Too bad she's always
with Marion and Rachel.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.143
Not in gym class.

09:26.441 --> 09:31.363
I don't like climbing the ropes,
but I do like ringing that bell.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.032
It's a little silly, but I like it too.

09:34.116 --> 09:37.536
Not as silly as
this whole coat vote thing, am I right?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.208
Beth Ellen, I need your help.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.293
I can't.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.299
What are you doin'?

09:50.382 --> 09:53.177
How many coats does Marion have?

09:54.052 --> 09:57.306
Welsch! One at a time on the ropes!

09:57.389 --> 09:58.932
I'll be right down!

09:59.850 --> 10:03.312
She says she only has one,
but I know that's not true!

10:03.395 --> 10:06.440
I can't. She'll know it was me.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.610
You don't have to say anything.
I'll just say a number.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.237
If it's more than that, ring the bell.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.031
Is it more than ten coats?

10:19.828 --> 10:21.371
More than 20 coats?

10:25.334 --> 10:26.335
Welsch!

10:26.418 --> 10:27.419
Okay!

10:28.670 --> 10:30.756
Thanks, Beth Ellen. Seriously.

10:31.924 --> 10:32.966
Rope burn.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.888
This is a big story, Bill.
Marion's not telling the truth.

10:38.597 --> 10:41.475
My source says she's got
at least 20 coats.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.936
I'm sorry, Harriet. I'm a journalist.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.813
I need more proof than
two dings on a rope bell.

10:48.607 --> 10:52.945
If Bill Kilroy needed proof,
there was only one way to get it.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.489
But would it be worth the risk?

11:13.799 --> 11:17.344
If Marion caught me,
she'd rat me out to my parents for sure.

11:18.470 --> 11:23.058
They'd ground me for life or banish me
to a tower like that Rapunzel.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.235
But maybe it didn't matter.

11:33.318 --> 11:37.072
When you're lucky enough to find
a coat that's truly you,

11:37.656 --> 11:40.492
maybe you just have to dig deep
and ask yourself,

11:40.576 --> 11:42.870
"What would Jack London do?"

11:42.953 --> 11:45.330
Silent as a shadow.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.652
There it is.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.487
Just need a better angle.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.161
Almost there.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.708
Just a little further.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.683
I totally bit the biscuit on my mission.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.938
But seeing Marion's death stare

12:51.021 --> 12:53.649
makes me think about
how she treated Pinky Whitehead

12:53.732 --> 12:55.484
and the Boy with the Purple Socks.

12:55.567 --> 13:00.113
And it makes me wonder, what if
this coat vote isn't just about me?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.534
It's late, Harriet.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.161
I'm just thinking about things.

13:06.245 --> 13:10.374
You can think them without being in bed
wearing your brand-new, expensive…

13:11.124 --> 13:12.543
ripped coat.

13:13.043 --> 13:16.964
Harriet, I promised your parents
you'd take care of this one.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.842
It's not a rip, it's a story.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.009
A story?

13:21.093 --> 13:26.181
A story where I make the world safe for
Pinky and the Boy with the Purple Socks

13:26.265 --> 13:30.102
and anybody who's sick of being picked on
by Marion Hawthorne.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.858
It's just something I gotta do.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.486
Just tell me how it ends.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.491
We will. Right, coat?

13:50.539 --> 13:52.708
Happy Tuesday, Gregory School.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.753
It's time for the morning announcements.
The weather today is gonna stay chilly,

13:56.837 --> 13:59.673
with a chance of more snow flurries
this afternoon.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.217
The hot lunch today is--

14:02.301 --> 14:04.386
Wait, where'd that go?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.180
Ah, yes. Sloppy joes.

14:07.598 --> 14:11.685
The inspirational quote for today comes
from A. A. Milne's Christopher Robin…

14:14.605 --> 14:17.524
who says, "You're braver than you believe,

14:18.192 --> 14:20.068
stronger than you seem

14:20.861 --> 14:24.281
and smarter than you-- you think."

14:26.033 --> 14:27.826
You're not allowed to be in here.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.536
It's an emergency.

14:30.746 --> 14:34.374
Hello, Gregory School.
This is Harriet M. Welsch

14:34.458 --> 14:37.252
with a special announcement
for the sixth grade.

14:37.336 --> 14:43.300
Your vote tomorrow isn't just about
who gets to wear the coat, me or Marion.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.719
It's also about freedom.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.056
Freedom from Marion
always treating us like jerks.

14:49.139 --> 14:55.229
But together, we've got a chance
to show her we deserve respect.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.813
Freedom!

14:56.897 --> 15:00.025
This peacoat is me. But it's you too.

15:00.609 --> 15:05.072
We're all in this together,
and we're doing it for one thing:

15:05.155 --> 15:06.281
freedom.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.339
Harriet, that was so great when you said--

15:24.174 --> 15:26.009
I will not be quiet!

15:28.428 --> 15:30.138
Okay, I'll be quiet. Sorry.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.975
-You've set me free.
-What?

15:33.058 --> 15:36.186
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'll say it out loud.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.230
Marion is such a pain!

15:39.982 --> 15:41.942
Because she likes my brother, Phillip.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.988
He's in the seventh grade at St. Albans.
She's always bugging me about him.

15:46.071 --> 15:49.324
"Does he have a girlfriend? And when's
his birthday? Can I come over?"

15:50.117 --> 15:51.451
She's just using me.

15:53.579 --> 15:54.746
Freedom!

15:57.332 --> 15:58.750
Freedom!

15:59.585 --> 16:02.296
This was it. It was happening.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.717
Hi, Harriet. Hi, Carrie.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.304
I was just counting up the votes.
I think we have a real chance tomorrow.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.430
Check it out.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.265
Amazing.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.475
Janie, you gotta see this.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.311
Why? It's over.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.938
No, we're tied. Look.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.024
I just got this.

16:22.107 --> 16:25.527
Guess who's having a big
pre-coat vote party after school

16:25.611 --> 16:27.112
for the whole sixth grade?

16:27.196 --> 16:30.657
She's trying to bribe everybody.
It won't work.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.161
It's a "make your own banana split" party.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.455
My voters will know it's a bribe.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.708
With a bottomless toppings bar.

16:41.627 --> 16:45.130
Marion is gonna ask me
to invite my brother. I just know it.

16:45.214 --> 16:48.383
And I will say,
"Nay. Harriet has set me free."

16:51.220 --> 16:53.639
No. Carrie, you have to go.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.974
And you have to invite Phillip.

16:56.642 --> 17:00.145
I'm gonna make him my secret weapon.

17:00.229 --> 17:01.563
He'll be there.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.239
Hello, children.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.281
Hello, Mrs. Hawthorne.

17:12.366 --> 17:14.992
Come in, come in. Let me take your coats.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.204
Take them where?

17:24.962 --> 17:29.258
Harriet M. Welsch.
I didn't expect to see you here.

17:29.341 --> 17:32.344
Sure can't say no
to a bottomless toppings bar.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.388
No, you cannot.

17:45.399 --> 17:46.984
Hi, Harriet.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.447
Oh, my gosh. He's here.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.616
Hi, Phillip.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.994
Nice job getting him here.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.829
I said he could have my banana split.

17:59.621 --> 18:00.831
I'm going in.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.126
Let me show you the ice cream bar.

18:14.303 --> 18:15.804
Jackpot.

18:16.305 --> 18:20.601
You want proof, Bill Kilroy?
I'll give you proof.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.687
Carrie told me you were a music fan,

18:23.770 --> 18:26.523
so I wanted to show you my new jukebox.

18:27.191 --> 18:29.860
I got it for winning
the all-city talent show.

18:30.861 --> 18:32.362
You win a lot of things.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.699
Swimming, archery, gymnastics.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.992
Spelling?

18:37.576 --> 18:39.912
I won with the word "onomatopoeia."

18:40.996 --> 18:45.626
I can spell that. O-N-O-M-A-T-P--

18:45.709 --> 18:47.794
No, I-- Wait, E-I--

18:51.381 --> 18:52.633
In that moment,

18:52.716 --> 18:55.219
the truth hit me right in the spleen.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.639
I was never going to beat Marion
at anything ever,

18:58.722 --> 19:01.642
until the end of time.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.478
Some people are born to be perfect.

19:05.020 --> 19:08.815
Other people are born to be scaredy-cats,
hiding in the back of a closet,

19:08.899 --> 19:11.818
trying to take a picture
of a bunch of dumb coats.

19:15.364 --> 19:16.698
Huh?

19:20.994 --> 19:24.456
It was a love letter
from Marion to Phillip.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.709
I realized I must've taken Marion's coat
when I left the party.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.419
It was an honest mistake,

19:29.503 --> 19:32.756
but one that could change
the course of history.

19:33.423 --> 19:37.052
I just had to arrange a secret rendezvous.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.681
Hey.

19:42.933 --> 19:46.311
Sorry. They were both in a big pile.
I just grabbed yours by mistake.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.110
Looking for this?

19:55.696 --> 19:56.864
Give it back.

19:57.781 --> 19:58.907
I could do that.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.952
Or I could show it to, I don't know,

20:02.035 --> 20:03.328
Phillip?

20:04.580 --> 20:07.040
No, don't, please.
I'll do whatever you want.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.668
I'll drop out of the coat vote. You win.

20:09.751 --> 20:12.963
After that dirty trick you pulled
with the banana split party,

20:13.046 --> 20:14.965
I should publish it in the school paper.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.598
But I'm not you.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.310
Good luck with the coat vote today.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.438
Really? But I thought--

20:29.521 --> 20:30.981
I wanna win for real.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.158
In the end,
the coat vote wasn't even close.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.955
A bottomless toppings bar
beats freedom every time.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.085
But still, there were
a few small victories.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.262
Freedom!

21:03.430 --> 21:04.723
Freedom.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.809
Hey, wait up.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.020
What?

21:10.103 --> 21:14.566
I just wanna say,
I'm sorry for saying you were a copier.

21:14.650 --> 21:17.152
There's no one like you,
Harriet M. Welsch,

21:17.236 --> 21:19.404
and there probably never will be.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.490
Thanks.

21:21.573 --> 21:24.451
And I just wanna say that
somebody has to beat you someday,

21:24.535 --> 21:26.161
and I hope it's me.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.164
Keep hoping.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.754
You know, I was thinking,

21:35.838 --> 21:38.549
there's no reason
we both can't wear the coat.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.843
I don't think
Smithers of London would mind.

21:40.926 --> 21:42.344
Smithers of London

21:45.806 --> 21:46.890
Really?

21:48.100 --> 21:52.312
For a second, I thought maybe
a new kind of era might be starting.

21:52.396 --> 21:55.315
The "Harriet and Marion not becoming
friends or anything,

21:55.399 --> 21:57.651
but still weirdly getting along" era.

22:00.279 --> 22:02.072
But when I got to school the next day,

22:02.155 --> 22:06.410
it was almost a relief to see that
Marion was still Marion.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.290
Where is your peacoat?

22:11.373 --> 22:14.459
It wasn't me. Not like this coat.

22:14.543 --> 22:16.962
It's from Paris. Très chic, non?

22:17.629 --> 22:21.091
And your coat is totally you.
I see that now.

22:21.175 --> 22:24.094
It's ripped, it's dirty,
you've lost a button.

22:24.178 --> 22:25.971
It's a total mess.

22:26.555 --> 22:30.517
My coat wasn't a total mess.
It was a story.

22:30.601 --> 22:34.021
And I couldn't wait to see the new places
it would take me

22:34.104 --> 22:36.690
and the new things
I would get to write about.

22:38.817 --> 22:41.486
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

22:41.570 --> 22:43.238
We just wanna be

22:44.364 --> 22:46.909
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

22:46.992 --> 22:52.497
We don't wanna be told what to do

22:54.666 --> 23:00.339
And I try my best to do good
In the neighborhood

23:00.422 --> 23:02.883
I smile real nice

23:02.966 --> 23:06.178
And I strive to tell the truth

23:06.261 --> 23:08.764
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:08.847 --> 23:10.682
We just wanna be

23:11.558 --> 23:14.311
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:14.394 --> 23:17.147
We don't wanna be told what to do

23:17.231 --> 23:19.733
I am gonna be who I wanna be

23:19.816 --> 23:21.735
My autonomy

23:22.444 --> 23:25.239
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:25.322 --> 23:27.241
We just wanna be

23:27.324 --> 23:30.077
No, I won't cut my hair

23:30.160 --> 23:32.746
And I'll wear whatever

23:32.829 --> 23:38.418
I like it when I get to be myself

23:38.502 --> 23:41.338
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:41.421 --> 23:46.134
We don't wanna be told what to do
