00:34.735 --> 00:38.505
What are our expectations?

00:38.506 --> 00:46.506
Which of the things we
desire are within reach?

00:47.248 --> 00:51.984
If not now, when?

00:51.985 --> 00:59.985
And will there be
some left for me?

01:52.346 --> 01:55.848
China's younger generation
is driving a growth

01:55.849 --> 02:00.253
in consumption.

02:00.254 --> 02:04.991
This is where the real power is.

02:04.992 --> 02:08.828
China.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.763
If you live in Manhattan like

02:10.764 --> 02:11.998
I do and you think you live in

02:11.999 --> 02:14.000
the center of the world, this

02:14.001 --> 02:15.702
place, Shanghai, will confront

02:15.703 --> 02:19.239
you with a very
different reality.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.843
Turn down a side street,
it's an ancient culture.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.279
Centuries old mix of culinary

02:26.280 --> 02:29.882
traditions, smells, flavors,
a block away, this.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.084
An ultramodern ever clanging

02:32.085 --> 02:35.054
cash register, levels of wealth,

02:35.055 --> 02:36.723
luxury, sheer volume of things

02:36.724 --> 02:39.892
and services unimagined by the

02:39.893 --> 02:43.763
greediest, most of
capitalist imperialists.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.899
The city is split by the river,

02:46.900 --> 02:49.035
a tributary of the yank sea in

02:49.036 --> 02:53.906
the oldest section which
features the newer built up

02:53.907 --> 02:54.141
section.

02:54.142 --> 02:55.942
The one thing I know for sure

02:55.943 --> 02:58.578
about China is I will
never know China.

02:58.579 --> 03:02.815
It's too big, too old,
too diverse, too deep.

03:02.816 --> 03:07.820
There's simply not enough time.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.290
That's for me, the joy of China.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.960
Facing a learning curve
that impossibly steep.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.428
The certain knowledge that even

03:15.429 --> 03:17.430
if I dedicated my life to

03:17.431 --> 03:20.667
learning about China, I'd
die mostly ignorant.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.902
That's exciting.

03:22.903 --> 03:23.571
It's too much.

03:23.572 --> 03:27.740
And it's changing.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.908
So fast.

03:28.909 --> 03:32.245
China has a population of around

03:32.246 --> 03:33.446
$1.3 billion people, and the

03:33.447 --> 03:34.914
number of them who are joining

03:34.915 --> 03:38.585
an explosive middle class
demanding their share of all

03:38.586 --> 03:40.320
that good stuff, infrastructure,

03:40.321 --> 03:42.689
the clothes, the cars, the gas,

03:42.690 --> 03:44.624
the fuel, is well, it's the

03:44.625 --> 03:52.625
engine that might well
drive the whole world.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.340
Very much, yes.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.674
Okay, what do you want?

04:01.675 --> 04:07.213
Order, of course,
some good dumplings.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.815
The professor is an economist

04:08.816 --> 04:12.151
and the current Dean of the
college of economics and

04:12.152 --> 04:17.156
management that
Shanghai university.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.158
Like so many people you meet

04:19.159 --> 04:22.395
here, he's Chinese, but
was educated in American

04:22.396 --> 04:24.063
universities and taught at Yale,

04:24.064 --> 04:27.467
Duke, and Arizona state.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.302
Forgive me, economics are not my

04:29.303 --> 04:32.305
area of expertise, I wallow in

04:32.306 --> 04:33.373
ignorance, but China looks

04:33.374 --> 04:35.207
different every time I come.

04:35.208 --> 04:40.580
It's changing so, so, so
quickly, how did that happen?

04:40.581 --> 04:44.050
China, enjoyed this long
period of peace, no serious

04:44.051 --> 04:44.552
enemy.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.152
No major wars.

04:45.152 --> 04:45.686
Right.

04:45.687 --> 04:51.491
So the manufacturing
industry really took off.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.894
Internally, formed
an open door policy.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.829
Every country willing
to trade with China.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.331
There's certainly no doubt

04:58.332 --> 05:03.169
that at this point, we are, our

05:03.170 --> 05:05.004
destinies are inextricably bound

05:05.005 --> 05:07.273
up, our economies are hope

05:07.274 --> 05:08.675
legislationly interming med, if

05:08.676 --> 05:10.910
one fails, the effect
would be disastrous.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.712
Global impact.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.447
We are, to say the least.

05:14.448 --> 05:21.253
It's certainly... beautiful.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.757
This is what I was waiting for.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.926
Literally small
steaming basket buns.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.695
But I translate them in my head

05:28.696 --> 05:30.797
to pillows of happiness that

05:30.798 --> 05:33.766
will scald your tongue and

05:33.767 --> 05:38.237
throat if you don't
know what you're doing.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.972
Look, there are a lot of reasons

05:39.973 --> 05:41.774
to come to China and Shanghai in

05:41.775 --> 05:43.376
particular, but these babies,

05:43.377 --> 05:48.280
done right, these things
alone are worth the trip.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.217
Ground pork and shrimp, folded

05:51.218 --> 05:53.219
exactly and always 20 times

05:53.220 --> 05:59.058
inside freshly made
individually rolled out dough.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.727
As their steamed a delicious,

06:00.728 --> 06:02.962
delicious fat renders into the

06:02.963 --> 06:04.631
soup of the gods, which then if

06:04.632 --> 06:10.102
you're not careful, causes
unforgettable damage as it

06:10.103 --> 06:13.740
changes your life forever.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.675
So good.

06:14.676 --> 06:17.610
In the China of the future,

06:17.611 --> 06:19.946
places like this will be even

06:19.947 --> 06:23.015
more packed by Chinese, by

06:23.016 --> 06:24.183
expats, by visitors looking for

06:24.184 --> 06:26.619
the deeply satisfying rush of

06:26.620 --> 06:27.987
screamingly hot goodness.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.491
The chewy, deeply savory,

06:31.492 --> 06:33.125
fragrant, perfectly shaped and

06:33.126 --> 06:35.595
folded ballistically designed

06:35.596 --> 06:38.498
vehicles for pure pleasure.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.100
And the allure of Shanghai's

06:41.101 --> 06:44.504
style pork chop, served with the

06:44.505 --> 06:52.505
local take on Worcestershire sauce.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.315
It's unbelievable.

06:55.316 --> 06:57.116
I really believe the word is

06:57.117 --> 07:01.287
con verget, and China will again

07:01.288 --> 07:02.722
be privatizing more and more,

07:02.723 --> 07:05.525
but the difficulty, nowadays,

07:05.526 --> 07:08.294
it's just, the technology is so

07:08.295 --> 07:11.030
advanced, we don't really meet

07:11.031 --> 07:12.364
that many people to do things

07:12.365 --> 07:14.534
that many people used to do.

07:14.535 --> 07:19.806
In which the population, seven

07:19.807 --> 07:21.173
billion people, probably doesn't

07:21.174 --> 07:22.809
need that many people
working anymore.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.477
Right.

07:23.478 --> 07:27.914
So the question is, what
should human beings do?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.582
You know.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.184
How can you let them not doing

07:32.185 --> 07:35.488
anything, and they're
still living a good life?

07:35.489 --> 07:37.490
Right.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.225
I don't know.

07:38.226 --> 07:41.260
It's going to be a big issue

07:41.261 --> 07:46.032
that can face the whole world.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.835
What is the future?

07:48.836 --> 07:49.169
I don't know.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.003
But to a very great extent, it

07:51.004 --> 07:53.272
is surely being determined here.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.842
Is there a plan?

07:55.843 --> 07:56.510
Probably not.

07:56.511 --> 07:59.345
Only appetites.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.213
And increasingly, the means to

08:01.214 --> 08:03.415
fulfill those appetites.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.752
Those dreams and aspirations.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.687
Who will drive the car that

08:07.688 --> 08:10.222
takes us to wherever
we are going?

08:10.223 --> 08:12.391
They will be young,
whoever they are.

08:12.392 --> 08:18.598
And not unlike yow, a
30-year-old Shanghai native

08:18.599 --> 08:20.366
ejtsed in the USA, current lay

08:20.367 --> 08:23.803
feature's reporter for
the Shanghai daily.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.873
She may be the picture of modern

08:26.874 --> 08:31.010
China, but this is her
favorite restaurant.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.611
China and Shanghai in particular

08:32.613 --> 08:34.881
might be transforming fast, but

08:34.881 --> 08:40.219
this place stays
resolutely the same.

08:40.220 --> 08:44.557
She runs the place, serving
classic, home style food.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.493
There's no menu,
no waiting list.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.462
And you only get a
seat if she likes you.

08:50.463 --> 08:54.466
I ordered too much, sorry.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.768
Fantastic.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.503
Very happy.

08:56.504 --> 09:00.439
We're joined by her friend,

09:00.440 --> 09:06.145
Lu an artist, and
Matthew, a restauranteur.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.914
How do you eat these?

09:07.915 --> 09:08.115
Whole.

09:08.116 --> 09:10.683
I eat them whole because
I really like this.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.018
That works.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.253
Oh, they're good.

09:14.254 --> 09:18.825
I think they cook a few seconds.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.860
They are tiny little shrimp,

09:20.861 --> 09:23.329
deep fried first and quicklies

09:23.330 --> 09:28.701
toed in the wok with garlic,
ginger, salt, and soy.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.170
What is classic Shanghai food?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.172
What's distinctive about it?

09:33.173 --> 09:37.276
Well this frinz, it's often...

09:37.277 --> 09:39.779
Friends, it's... for instance,

09:39.780 --> 09:41.447
it's often black, and dark.

09:41.448 --> 09:45.685
It has been for some time
a city of immigrants.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.788
The food reflects
that genealogy.

09:48.789 --> 09:53.860
A combination of people from the

09:53.861 --> 09:55.795
province known for soy and

09:55.796 --> 09:56.963
vinegar, and others known for

09:56.964 --> 09:58.064
fresh ingredients and attention

09:58.065 --> 10:01.400
to preserving the
aliveness of its dishes.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.236
It's the best of both worlds.

10:04.237 --> 10:08.474
Great sauces, great ingredients.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.643
There's braised pork belly in a

10:10.644 --> 10:12.478
deep red glaze of dark and light

10:12.479 --> 10:18.017
soy sauce, cinnamon,
sugar, and annise.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.419
A small fish poached first in

10:20.420 --> 10:22.488
rice wine, salt and light soy,

10:22.489 --> 10:25.357
then fried in ginger garlic oil,

10:25.358 --> 10:28.427
more soy and sugar until it's

10:28.428 --> 10:31.330
reduced into a
gorgeous sticky sauce.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.835
Duck that's been marinated,
blanched, then reheated,

10:35.836 --> 10:37.336
smothered in a sauce made from

10:37.337 --> 10:38.738
the reduced drippings left in

10:38.739 --> 10:42.341
the wok with dark
soy, salt, and sugar.

10:42.342 --> 10:45.044
And this to round things out, a

10:45.045 --> 10:47.279
Clay pot soup of bean curd based

10:47.280 --> 10:49.448
stock with salted pork belly,

10:49.449 --> 10:52.685
tofu ribbons, and bamboo chutes.

10:52.686 --> 10:56.956
Oh good flavor.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.459
This is a socialist
country, supposedly.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.528
Yep.

11:02.529 --> 11:05.397
But it's a communist
country, supposedly.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.465
It is in fact from evidence that

11:06.466 --> 11:09.235
I've seen, the most dynamic

11:09.236 --> 11:12.271
capitalist country on earth.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.539
What do you think about that?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.808
I think a lot of my western

11:15.809 --> 11:19.779
friends come here thinking China

11:19.780 --> 11:23.382
is a version of North Korea or

11:23.383 --> 11:24.550
the party controls everything,

11:24.551 --> 11:26.652
but they come here, they are

11:26.653 --> 11:28.654
surprised, it's
actually not that much.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.657
They do seem to be promoting the

11:31.658 --> 11:36.996
free market even more with
the free trade zone, just

11:36.997 --> 11:37.898
established in Shanghai.

11:37.899 --> 11:39.065
It's amazing.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.001
From what I see, everywhere

11:42.002 --> 11:43.335
we go, more Chinese, Chinese

11:43.336 --> 11:44.636
influence, Chinese food, if you

11:44.637 --> 11:47.439
build a casino in Vegas or a

11:47.440 --> 11:49.675
hotel in Singapore, you have to

11:49.676 --> 11:51.143
consider what will the Chinese

11:51.144 --> 11:52.344
think, is that exciting?

11:52.345 --> 11:59.451
It's exciting that we finally

11:59.452 --> 12:01.821
have a thing that we wouldn't.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.256
China is sort of in a spotlight

12:04.257 --> 12:06.192
in the central, we wouldn't have

12:06.193 --> 12:08.660
dreamed of, like say
only a decade ago.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.697
For me, I think, you know,

12:11.698 --> 12:13.766
the communist menace that we

12:13.767 --> 12:16.268
always used to talk about in
America, I think the most

12:16.269 --> 12:17.703
terrifying scenario is that

12:17.704 --> 12:25.444
China becomes a completely
free market, non-socialist,

12:25.445 --> 12:29.449
non-communist society
because you'd bury us.

12:36.857 --> 12:41.127
I love few things more than
quoting that impeccable

12:41.128 --> 12:46.532
communist Deng Sho Peng
to be rich is glorious.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.200
All isms are Wasims.

12:47.201 --> 12:51.370
Dig deep, and it's
always about the money.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.671
Meet Tim Si.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.206
Resident of communist China, man

12:54.207 --> 12:56.675
of impeccable taste, one of more

12:56.676 --> 13:00.379
than 150,000 Shanghainese

13:00.380 --> 13:02.048
millionaires accustomed
to the good life.

13:02.049 --> 13:06.052
Take the sea water out,
we place with champagne.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.253
Have it only once.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.221
Hopefully you like it.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.721
He likes nice things.

13:09.722 --> 13:13.359
And he makes Donald Trump's

13:13.360 --> 13:15.694
ticky tacky empire look like the

13:15.695 --> 13:18.264
back of Pauly D.'S Van.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.366
Where are these from?

13:20.367 --> 13:21.234
They're great.

13:21.234 --> 13:21.568
France.

13:21.569 --> 13:23.069
France, fantastic.

13:23.070 --> 13:23.570
Good shape.

13:23.571 --> 13:24.904
I keep them happy.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.239
Every single one is flown from

13:27.240 --> 13:29.008
jet so they're nice
and happy and safe.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.711
Apparently.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.713
Tim is an investor into real

13:34.714 --> 13:37.416
estate, telecoms, and the newly

13:37.417 --> 13:39.886
expanding service industries
of the new China.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.720
He's also the president of

13:41.721 --> 13:44.690
Roosevelt China investments, a

13:44.691 --> 13:45.292
very old company with a long

13:45.292 --> 13:46.259
history doing business here.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.560
Created by the Roosevelt family,

13:48.561 --> 13:51.030
maybe you've heard of them.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.765
This is his clubhouse, really,

13:53.766 --> 13:58.537
the house of Roosevelt right
in the middle of it all.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.606
Wine is big here now.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.941
The French chateaus more and

14:01.942 --> 14:04.043
more they look to China as the

14:04.044 --> 14:06.946
indicators of price
as the market maker.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.716
Tim alone has stocked
around 4,000 labels here.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.418
China in general bought two

14:12.419 --> 14:14.954
billion bottles of red
wine last year alone.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.388
Think about that for a minute.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.790
They are now the leading market

14:18.791 --> 14:22.294
for red wine in the world.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.297
It's pretty amazing here.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.400
I designed this place
in five minutes.

14:28.401 --> 14:33.405
I look at this place like
six months... uh-huh.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.641
Daytime, nighttime, and

14:35.642 --> 14:38.144
finally one morning, I said, I'm

14:38.145 --> 14:40.947
going to make a wine
cellar out of this.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.781
It looks so good.

14:42.782 --> 14:43.283
Thank you.

14:43.284 --> 14:44.350
This is nice.

14:44.351 --> 14:44.851
Hi.

14:45.152 --> 14:50.589
Tim invited me to dinner
alongside of people who have

14:50.590 --> 14:54.994
taken full advantage of
the booming economy.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.628
Daniel, a real estate developer,

14:56.629 --> 15:01.367
and cocoa, a party planner.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.602
You eat like this all the time?

15:03.603 --> 15:04.603
Nice wine cellar.

15:04.604 --> 15:08.507
Twice a night.

15:08.508 --> 15:14.646
Today we're surrounded by
Southern French wine, and

15:14.647 --> 15:15.215
Italian wine.

15:15.216 --> 15:19.885
And if you like it, you can

15:19.886 --> 15:21.954
drink from wine
country every night.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.823
Isn't this supposed to
be communist China?

15:24.824 --> 15:29.295
I mean, it seems like... can
I ask one question, any

15:29.296 --> 15:34.633
one of the communist party
comrades party member?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.635
No.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.071
I'm a bit of a red diaper baby.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.073
What I mean to say, it just

15:41.074 --> 15:45.044
seems that the realm of the
possible here is very big.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.379
Absolutely.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.514
It's a big stage.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.716
I mean, in New York City, you

15:50.717 --> 15:53.986
can see that, and why
a massive party.

15:53.987 --> 15:57.723
That's probably the only
one in the whole city.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.058
There's tenth massive parties

15:59.059 --> 16:01.727
going on, and there's ten more

16:01.728 --> 16:03.695
coming up in the next
couple of years.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.699
It's a big city, but small
village at the end.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.703
And I think food is the best

16:11.704 --> 16:14.006
weapons on earth to make peace.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.774
It's the food.

16:15.775 --> 16:16.842
It's the drink.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.578
We have better peace on earth.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.948
And you probably the
united nation ambassador.

16:22.949 --> 16:30.089
In time.

16:30.090 --> 16:34.226
From south pole.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.595
Only New Zealand has found them.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.930
Try it, wasabi if you'd like.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.400
A lot of Chinese
restaurant in New York...

16:41.401 --> 16:44.270
I grew up in the 50s and 60s,

16:44.271 --> 16:47.306
even then, Chinese restaurant,

16:47.307 --> 16:49.708
Chinese food was really an

16:49.709 --> 16:50.909
essential part of
being a new yorker.

16:50.910 --> 16:54.213
I mean if you don't know
thousand use chop sticks as a

16:54.214 --> 16:58.884
new yorker, you were a
terrible new yorker.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.952
I'll ask one thing, you know

17:00.953 --> 17:03.922
how to speak like a
Brooklyn person?

17:03.923 --> 17:06.125
It's a tough accent.

17:06.126 --> 17:10.561
Queens is easier, it's more of

17:10.563 --> 17:13.299
a, I can't, I mean, I live right

17:13.300 --> 17:15.267
next to it my whole life.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.002
We don't want to hear it.

17:17.002 --> 17:20.939
I just to want hear
not for nothing.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.108
What?

17:22.108 --> 17:25.176
Not for nothing.

17:25.178 --> 17:25.645
That's Brooklyn.

17:25.646 --> 17:27.779
Not for nothing.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.783
Not for nothing, but I could
use a little more wine.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.051
There.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.453
Not for nothing.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.155
Nothing, nothing.

17:35.156 --> 17:36.422
Not for nothing.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.825
Not for nothing.

17:39.826 --> 17:44.496
All right.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.797
Shanghai chef prepares a meal

17:45.798 --> 17:48.667
of a style that will become

17:48.668 --> 17:49.436
without a doubt more and more

17:49.437 --> 17:50.836
typical and in demand here among

17:50.837 --> 17:51.937
those who can afford it.

17:51.938 --> 17:58.009
And more and more people
every day can afford it.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.512
What is it?

18:00.513 --> 18:04.383
We have tomato and
potato, and that's it.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.519
What else do we have?

18:07.520 --> 18:10.956
Australian beef, a massive,

18:10.957 --> 18:14.126
perfectly cooked Tom hawk chop,

18:14.127 --> 18:18.164
$150 a pound, that
includes bones and fat.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.632
This is about a thousand
dollars worth of steak.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.169
Even if Tim wanted to serve good

18:23.170 --> 18:25.837
old USA beef, still the finest

18:25.838 --> 18:28.840
on earth in my
opinion, he can't.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.377
China has banned imports over

18:31.378 --> 18:32.978
concerns of mad cow disease.

18:32.979 --> 18:37.583
While they carve, the quick
trip behind the bookshelf.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.352
Now I want to show
you the best place.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.488
Wow.

18:42.489 --> 18:47.426
So you name, your label,
the village of wines.

18:47.427 --> 18:51.663
There's a chance we have it.

18:51.664 --> 18:55.501
And so this size is our
interesting wine that they can

18:55.502 --> 18:57.269
keep ageing themselves.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.171
This is the house collection.

18:59.172 --> 18:59.839
That's correct.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.240
Right.

19:00.241 --> 19:03.242
And I want to show you
the membership area.

19:03.243 --> 19:07.045
The newest member,
Anthony Bourdain.

19:07.046 --> 19:07.747
Me?

19:07.748 --> 19:10.916
And it's all our collection

19:10.917 --> 19:15.354
of wriens, please, open it.

19:15.355 --> 19:15.522
Ah.

19:15.523 --> 19:18.424
Well, cool.

19:18.425 --> 19:23.862
It's good being
the... thank you.

19:23.863 --> 19:24.564
Thank you so much.

19:24.565 --> 19:25.931
Close that up, man.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.601
Close it up.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.651
Here's the thing, even with

19:45.652 --> 19:47.118
the modern China rising out of

19:47.119 --> 19:48.587
the ground all around you, even

19:48.588 --> 19:51.623
with all the things the same
things you see for sale

19:51.624 --> 19:52.492
everywhere where people have

19:52.493 --> 19:55.927
money these days, even with all

19:55.928 --> 20:00.766
that, there's still this China.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.402
Shoning road, just south
of people's square.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.637
It's still happening.

20:05.638 --> 20:09.107
The good old stuff.

20:09.108 --> 20:12.478
The China you first
fell in love with.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.580
Walk down the street and look in

20:14.581 --> 20:17.749
any direction, and there's
something to eat.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.685
I may not know what it is

20:19.686 --> 20:24.290
immediately, but chances
are, it's good.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.926
We talk about foodies and
what does that mean?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.428
By current definition, best I

20:29.429 --> 20:34.333
can understand it, that makes

20:34.334 --> 20:34.967
just about every Chinese person

20:34.968 --> 20:35.968
I ever laid eyes on a foodie.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.503
Which is to say a perfectly

20:37.504 --> 20:39.771
reasonable person who enjoys and

20:39.772 --> 20:44.142
pays attention to where
the good stuff is.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.210
Look at this.

20:45.211 --> 20:49.348
One street, and look, stuffed

20:49.349 --> 20:51.850
oysters grilled over charcoal.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.552
Snake bits, why yes.

20:53.553 --> 21:01.553
And yes, it does taste
kind of like chicken.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.531
There used to be a lot of
streets like this full of it

21:05.532 --> 21:07.032
where you could look, shop

21:07.033 --> 21:11.670
around, then eat all
out in the open.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.738
Happy, delicious torrent of

21:12.739 --> 21:14.806
food, but the government, as

21:14.807 --> 21:18.477
governments do, are
tightening the screws.

21:18.478 --> 21:24.550
Old is bad, new is good.

21:24.551 --> 21:31.823
Not everybody thinks this
is a good idea though.

21:31.824 --> 21:36.227
Bill Wang was born in Shanghai
and studied here at the

21:36.228 --> 21:36.563
university.

21:36.564 --> 21:38.229
He began teaching English before

21:38.230 --> 21:39.765
he was out of college.

21:39.766 --> 21:43.369
He suggested we meet, and there

21:43.370 --> 21:45.571
may be stalls all over Shanghai,

21:45.572 --> 21:51.510
but bill says this one,
this one is the one.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.412
So you're an English teacher?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.746
Yes, yes.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.182
Most of the people I meet of

21:57.183 --> 21:59.284
Chinese background who speak

21:59.285 --> 22:07.092
English have, their teachers
were British, sometimes

22:07.093 --> 22:08.860
Australian, or New Zealand.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.228
Younger generation, there's more

22:10.229 --> 22:11.563
of that sort of TV accent.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.632
Is that good or bad?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.601
I think it's good.

22:15.602 --> 22:18.036
You know, TV series, especially

22:18.037 --> 22:21.940
American TV series are
so popular in China.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.242
What are the most popular?

22:24.243 --> 22:26.244
Right now, house of cards.

22:26.245 --> 22:27.379
House of cards.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.047
Yeah.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.081
So popular.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.149
House of card.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.118
That's really interesting, what

22:33.119 --> 22:34.453
do you think the appeal is here?

22:34.454 --> 22:39.591
You know, in the show,
American, they talk about

22:39.592 --> 22:40.726
president, in China there's no

22:40.727 --> 22:43.094
way you can talk about
those sensitive topics.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.430
So many people love that show,

22:44.431 --> 22:45.431
it's really, really good.

22:45.432 --> 22:50.101
Wow, that's really
a surprise to me.

22:50.102 --> 22:50.269
Wow.

22:50.269 --> 22:50.603
This is huge.

22:50.604 --> 22:56.508
Yes.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.477
Yeah.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.145
Yum, good.

22:59.146 --> 23:00.412
Is it good?

23:00.413 --> 23:08.319
Uh-huh.

23:08.320 --> 23:13.191
Minced pork, ginger, moistened
with rice wine, soy,

23:13.192 --> 23:17.529
it all gets mixed up nicely
and folded into the dough.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.998
Boiled until just right and

23:19.999 --> 23:22.333
sauced with soy sauce, vinegar,

23:22.334 --> 23:25.170
sesame oil, and peanut butter.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.372
You have a sweet, savory thing

23:27.373 --> 23:30.476
going on with every bite.

23:30.477 --> 23:31.043
You want this.

23:31.044 --> 23:34.613
Believe me, you want this bad.

23:34.614 --> 23:38.149
In fact, you need it.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.651
What do your students want to do

23:39.652 --> 23:42.454
when they enter the
professional field?

23:42.455 --> 23:42.989
What's the dream?

23:42.990 --> 23:46.357
I think this generation,
there are a lot of them are

23:46.358 --> 23:46.559
lost.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.859
They don't know what to do.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.729
If you ask like the university,
what is the dream?

23:50.730 --> 23:53.364
Right.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.634
Buy an apartment in Shanghai,

23:55.635 --> 23:58.403
buy a car, you know,
that kinds of things.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.472
Are there enough
jobs for everybody?

24:00.473 --> 24:02.641
It's becoming more and
more competitive.

24:02.642 --> 24:03.042
Right.

24:03.043 --> 24:05.243
Everybody wants the best job,

24:05.244 --> 24:07.045
so many very few
of them out there.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.080
But I think there's like a huge

24:09.081 --> 24:11.216
gap between company
and new graduates.

24:11.217 --> 24:11.584
Right.

24:11.585 --> 24:14.720
Company wants
experienced workers.

24:14.721 --> 24:15.254
Right.

24:15.255 --> 24:17.055
New graduates also
want a good job.

24:17.056 --> 24:17.690
Now.

24:17.690 --> 24:18.591
Yeah, now.

24:18.592 --> 24:19.758
They are not ready for it.

24:19.759 --> 24:20.560
Right.

24:20.561 --> 24:23.161
They don't want to do some,

24:23.162 --> 24:26.331
you know, hard work,
start from scratch.

24:26.332 --> 24:26.599
Right.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.534
So that's the problem.

24:27.535 --> 24:29.568
It looks to me, China in

24:29.569 --> 24:30.902
general, Shanghai in particular,

24:30.903 --> 24:32.270
is changing very, very fast.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.404
Very, very fast.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.173
Every time I come,
it's different.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.742
And in your recent memory, in

24:36.743 --> 24:38.443
the last ten years, what's the

24:38.444 --> 24:40.579
most noticeable change to you?

24:40.580 --> 24:42.548
Food like this.

24:42.549 --> 24:45.851
It's becoming more and
more difficult to find.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.587
This is handmade.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.921
And I think this is real food.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.090
It's not very expensive, and it

24:52.091 --> 24:54.059
tastes great, but a lot of food,

24:54.060 --> 24:56.728
you know, processed
food right now.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.464
And also, of course Internet.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.432
It has pros and cons, the good

25:01.433 --> 25:04.603
part is that you can get
information easily.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.271
Right.

25:05.272 --> 25:06.605
That part is people don't

25:06.606 --> 25:08.273
talk to each other, that's bad.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.075
People go to a restaurant, you

25:10.076 --> 25:12.377
know, like a couple, they take

25:12.378 --> 25:13.745
pictures, and use their cell

25:13.746 --> 25:15.581
phone, they don't
talk to each other.

25:15.582 --> 25:18.083
They're communicating with
everybody else in the world

25:18.084 --> 25:19.284
except who's at the table.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.252
What's the point.

25:20.253 --> 25:23.622
It didn't happen until
you tweeted, as we say.

25:23.623 --> 25:26.726
Oh my gosh.

25:39.171 --> 25:44.910
What's clear very quickly
here is the way China claims

25:44.911 --> 25:46.845
things are the way they're

25:46.846 --> 25:50.148
supposed to be, and the way they

25:50.149 --> 25:54.920
actually are, two
different things.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.422
Meet Thomas you.

25:57.423 --> 25:59.625
Hacker turned entrepreneur.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.793
He recently received significant

26:01.794 --> 26:03.361
startup money to build what he

26:03.362 --> 26:07.132
calls an open source
project sharing platform.

26:07.133 --> 26:11.670
To connect Chinese college
students with the world.

26:11.671 --> 26:15.006
When you say hacking, what is,

26:15.007 --> 26:17.108
what do you do when you hack?

26:17.109 --> 26:19.477
What's the intent?

26:19.478 --> 26:22.513
Actually, it starts from MIT.

26:22.514 --> 26:25.717
If you go to the computer
science and artificial

26:25.718 --> 26:28.153
intelligence building, MIT, it

26:28.154 --> 26:30.521
will show you the
definition of hack.

26:30.522 --> 26:33.859
It's actually a very positive

26:33.860 --> 26:36.027
word that's been in
a negative word.

26:36.028 --> 26:40.398
One hacker is people who are
really, they really like

26:40.399 --> 26:43.368
programming, and they love
to share information.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.569
Just like cooking.

26:44.570 --> 26:49.875
You love to share recipes to
other friend for a lot of

26:49.876 --> 26:50.209
cooking.

26:50.210 --> 26:53.344
Legally, there might be
something wrong with it, but

26:53.345 --> 26:54.345
morally do you think there's

26:54.346 --> 26:57.515
anything wrong with you're

26:57.516 --> 26:59.050
essentially breaking into
an information base.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.551
I'm not doing any damage, I'm

27:00.552 --> 27:02.053
going to look around, see how

27:02.054 --> 27:03.822
things work, and I'll leave

27:03.823 --> 27:05.090
without disturbing anything.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.492
Would most hackers say
that that's okay?

27:07.493 --> 27:08.727
Yes.

27:08.728 --> 27:09.061
Yes.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.429
It's in the service
of knowledge.

27:11.430 --> 27:17.736
It's okay for most of the
hackers in our communities.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.537
I was lucky, I got into a big

27:19.538 --> 27:21.239
hacker community here in shank

27:21.240 --> 27:23.241
lie and met great mentors.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.210
Started in business in 21.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.246
I did.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.580
Great accomplishment.

27:29.581 --> 27:30.949
You didn't go to college?

27:30.950 --> 27:32.450
I didn't.

27:32.451 --> 27:36.521
Why not?

27:36.522 --> 27:39.224
The country is so advanced in

27:39.225 --> 27:42.260
so many other ways,
why in this area?

27:42.261 --> 27:45.096
Network problem here in

27:45.097 --> 27:48.800
China, we have GFW, it blocks a

27:48.801 --> 27:51.737
lot of important
information websites.

27:51.738 --> 27:58.609
And a lot of people, we can't
use in college at all.

27:58.610 --> 28:01.913
And so the human resource
problem and power problem is

28:01.914 --> 28:04.049
getting more and more
serious here in China.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.585
Because everyone's going
to silicon valley?

28:07.586 --> 28:10.555
They offer better, obviously.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.257
These are the famous ribs?

28:12.258 --> 28:12.792
Yes.

28:12.793 --> 28:13.992
Maybe the number one thing

28:13.993 --> 28:15.626
that the seriously food crazed

28:15.627 --> 28:16.828
traveler coming back from

28:16.829 --> 28:19.664
Shanghai will tell you to eat,

28:19.665 --> 28:27.665
other than the soup
dumplings of course, ribs.

28:40.519 --> 28:44.990
It takes two cooks working
at once to make this dish.

28:44.991 --> 28:48.827
One deep fries the ribs in
hot oil until just right.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.929
Another toasts the ginger,

28:50.930 --> 28:54.299
cumin, and other
spices in a wok.

28:54.300 --> 28:58.703
And then, in go the ribs.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.471
And if you're devoted of what's

29:00.472 --> 29:04.675
called wok, you sit as close as

29:04.676 --> 29:08.446
possible to capture that
elusive, fast dissipating

29:08.447 --> 29:12.083
breath, flavor of
the wok itself.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.952
Toss them around coating those

29:13.953 --> 29:17.355
bones with all that
good stuff, then serve.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.358
And because we like it to burn,

29:20.359 --> 29:26.697
Thomas orders some
spicy chicken dish.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.533
Hey means energy, light force,

29:28.534 --> 29:32.470
or breath, and that's what
you're looking for of the

29:32.471 --> 29:36.241
flavor, the essence of a very

29:36.242 --> 29:44.242
old, carefully seasoned
cooking vessel.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.396
Oddly enough, Thomas tells me

29:58.397 --> 30:02.267
there's no mandarin or at least

30:02.268 --> 30:04.335
Shanghainese work for wok, it's

30:04.336 --> 30:05.536
simply called a cooking pot.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.438
To which I say I really do know

30:07.439 --> 30:11.742
nothing about this country.

30:11.743 --> 30:12.278
Fantastic.

30:12.279 --> 30:14.913
Wow.

30:14.914 --> 30:15.114
Yeah.

30:15.115 --> 30:17.115
I love that.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.917
Not too good.

30:18.918 --> 30:19.718
Not bad.

30:19.719 --> 30:22.753
To me, and I've eat an lot of

30:22.754 --> 30:29.194
food, this is spicy,
fresh, bright, vibrant...

30:29.195 --> 30:30.628
I will take you
somewhere better.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.964
So are you a foodie?

30:32.965 --> 30:35.766
Yeah, I eat a lot.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.803
Were you born here, in Shanghai?

30:38.804 --> 30:39.438
Yeah.

30:39.439 --> 30:41.272
At least in modern times,

30:41.273 --> 30:42.473
it's hard to imagine that any

30:42.474 --> 30:44.642
place has changed as profoundly

30:44.643 --> 30:49.780
and changing as quickly
as it is changing here.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.816
We feel very proud.

30:51.817 --> 30:54.819
We really feel proud.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.922
Our qualities of life is

30:56.923 --> 30:58.957
improving really, really faster.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.726
In a poll, 85% of Chinese who

31:01.727 --> 31:03.628
were asked the question, do you

31:03.629 --> 31:09.935
feel that your life will
be better next year?

31:09.936 --> 31:13.338
85% said yes, it will
be better next year.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.240
This is an extraordinary number.

31:15.241 --> 31:15.942
Yeah.

31:15.943 --> 31:17.475
I don't know a lot of other

31:17.476 --> 31:20.778
countries that would say that.

31:20.779 --> 31:21.347
Yeah.

31:21.348 --> 31:27.452
Well that looks great.

31:27.453 --> 31:28.586
Famous chicken.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.155
So good.

31:29.156 --> 31:33.124
Not bad.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.193
You know, I'm finding this

31:35.194 --> 31:36.761
food really, really delicious.

31:36.762 --> 31:43.668
And you're saying it's
just... it's so-so.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.138
Wow.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.015
Shanghai is one of the
biggest cities in the world

31:57.016 --> 31:58.349
right now.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.351
A global financial center and

32:00.352 --> 32:04.189
transportation hub and the
world's busiest port.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.791
You can smell the money.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.793
But maybe the real story is the

32:08.794 --> 32:12.697
newly emerging participants
in global capitalism.

32:12.698 --> 32:13.632
The middle class.

32:13.633 --> 32:16.167
The working class.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.169
Who also want flat screen TVs

32:18.170 --> 32:20.305
and cars, and vacations, and the

32:20.306 --> 32:24.375
promise of better
for their kids.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.544
Take this couple, typical

32:26.545 --> 32:31.749
working class Chinese from
the worker's paradise.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.819
Mei, a bus driver, and
Don, his bride to be.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.854
Today is their wedding day.

32:36.855 --> 32:38.889
And custom must be observed.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.891
When it comes to weddings, the

32:40.892 --> 32:42.327
Chinese have always gone big,

32:42.328 --> 32:44.996
and these days, bigger still.

32:44.997 --> 32:49.667
Lots of food, lots of
booze, lots of people.

32:49.668 --> 32:50.569
Getting crazy.

32:50.570 --> 32:52.570
Which is why Thomas and I have

32:52.571 --> 32:55.006
become wedding crashers.

32:55.007 --> 32:58.676
The constellation bar
for a prewedding drink.

32:58.677 --> 33:03.248
The classic Chinese
cocktail, the Moscow mule.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.249
Okay, maybe not Chinese.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.683
These are good.

33:05.684 --> 33:06.285
Yeah.

33:06.286 --> 33:09.687
This is the reason why
I love this place.

33:09.688 --> 33:10.755
Are you married?

33:10.756 --> 33:11.390
No.

33:11.391 --> 33:13.024
Not yet.

33:13.025 --> 33:16.194
I'm not a big fan of marriage.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.862
You've been to weddings, yes?

33:17.863 --> 33:19.264
Yes.

33:19.265 --> 33:23.468
Have you ever crashed
a wedding before?

33:23.469 --> 33:26.271
No.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.605
It's going to be a little weird.

33:27.606 --> 33:31.809
I mean, we don't
know anybody there.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.945
How do you do?

33:34.946 --> 33:38.783
Well, I hope the food's
good that the thing.

33:38.784 --> 33:44.722
You probably have
a lot of drinks.

33:44.723 --> 33:45.756
Could be really crazy.

33:45.757 --> 33:46.458
Oh really?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.159
Yeah.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.293
Uh-oh.

33:48.294 --> 33:51.629
Drink a lot.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.099
Really?

33:54.100 --> 33:55.566
So, ready to crash a wedding?

33:55.567 --> 33:59.304
Yeah, let's do it.

33:59.305 --> 34:07.305
All right.

34:07.946 --> 34:15.946
♪

34:16.021 --> 34:17.487
Yeah.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.489
The Chinese wedding
is not cheap.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.359
You need a banquet room, in this

34:21.360 --> 34:22.659
case the families rented out

34:22.661 --> 34:28.166
this place at the historic
park hotel Shanghai.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.833
Chinese weddings generally

34:29.835 --> 34:31.469
speaking, mean the presence of a

34:31.469 --> 34:37.542
number of formalities.

34:37.543 --> 34:42.280
First, meet the bride and
groom upon entering.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.782
Red envelope, also known as the

34:44.783 --> 34:46.784
hung bow, like in good fellas,

34:46.784 --> 34:48.985
it's a little something
for the bride and groom.

34:48.987 --> 34:56.987
Help them get started
in their new life.

35:01.400 --> 35:05.536
Thank you.

35:05.537 --> 35:05.737
Okay.

35:05.738 --> 35:06.904
Table setting.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.474
Often with some
must-haves present.

35:09.475 --> 35:15.813
Booze, whisky, smokes
for the guests.

35:15.814 --> 35:20.885
So this is kind of like a
traditional Chinese wedding.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.554
Oh, I know, I do
this every week.

35:23.555 --> 35:27.892
Hotel to hotel, and
I crash weddings.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.194
Okay.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.895
Roast duck, that I will have,

35:30.896 --> 35:36.401
of course, and some beef fried ♪

35:36.402 --> 35:38.703
kona crab, shelled and then

35:38.704 --> 35:40.438
sauted in garlic and ginger

35:40.439 --> 35:45.276
before being stuffed
back into the shell.
