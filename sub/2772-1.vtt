08:20.600 --> 08:21.674
John!

08:22.602 --> 08:23.778
John Rambo!

08:29.401 --> 08:30.879
I don't believe this!

08:38.491 --> 08:40.890
- So where you're coming from?
- Washington.

08:41.871 --> 08:44.119
- Good to see you again!
- Yeah, you too.

08:46.335 --> 08:48.084
Do you want to tell me about it?

08:49.337 --> 08:50.358
About what?

08:50.838 --> 08:54.505
About yesterday, I've seen you stick
fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.211
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

08:57.888 --> 09:00.697
And today I find you,
working in a monastery.

09:01.683 --> 09:04.664
They let me live here and
I help out, fixing things.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.247
And the stick fighting?

09:07.187 --> 09:08.727
I just do that for their lack of money.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.774
Yeah...I saw you give it to the monks.

09:14.446 --> 09:15.477
You see a lot.

09:19.035 --> 09:20.325
Colonel, who are they?

09:20.535 --> 09:22.241
They're part of the reason I'm here.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.103
This is Robert Griggs, he's a
field officer of our local embassy.

09:28.459 --> 09:29.574
John Rambo.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.872
Pleasure.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.173
Well, you're sure not easy to find!

09:34.382 --> 09:35.883
Why are you keepin' track?

09:36.886 --> 09:40.046
Well, like the Colonel says,
good men are hard to find!

09:43.934 --> 09:46.530
John, I'd like you to take a
look at some of these photos.

09:47.396 --> 09:49.472
I don't know how much you
know about Afghanistan.

09:49.941 --> 09:52.611
Most people can't even find it on a map!

09:53.068 --> 09:55.274
But over two million civilians,

09:55.685 --> 09:57.874
mostly peasants
farmers and their families,

09:57.875 --> 10:01.733
have been systematically
slaughtered by invading Russian armies.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.408
Every new weapon,

10:07.333 --> 10:10.536
including chemical warfare, has
been used to eliminate these people.

10:11.107 --> 10:13.565
And they've been very
successful, at many levels.

10:14.967 --> 10:18.673
I assume that you're out of touch
with the current states of the war.

10:19.428 --> 10:21.135
But after nine years of fighting,

10:21.596 --> 10:24.118
the Afghan Forces are now
getting their Stinger missiles,

10:24.119 --> 10:26.639
and are now beginning to hold
their own against the Air-Strikes.

10:27.103 --> 10:30.686
Except for one region,
50 miles over the border.

10:31.650 --> 10:34.915
Apparently, the Soviet Commander
there is exceptionally brutal,

10:35.069 --> 10:36.729
as those photos indicate.

10:37.196 --> 10:40.381
And he's managed to string
allow all aid from the outside.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.819
So we want to...

10:45.372 --> 10:47.868
investigate the problem firsthand.

10:48.123 --> 10:49.972
And what that's got to do with me?

10:52.169 --> 10:53.627
They've asked me to go in.

10:54.567 --> 10:55.712
You're not gonna do it?

10:56.049 --> 10:59.465
Yes. And I want you to
come with me, John.

11:00.053 --> 11:01.487
I put in my time.

11:02.010 --> 11:03.132
What does that mean?

11:04.515 --> 11:06.261
It means my war is over.

11:17.278 --> 11:20.384
I thought you said he
was this great soldier.

11:21.367 --> 11:22.742
Well, Colonel...

11:23.202 --> 11:25.948
that's like we've got a
long walk down those stairs.

11:42.345 --> 11:45.762
Don't be tough on him,
he's just following orders.

11:47.058 --> 11:49.097
This mission's important, John.

11:49.978 --> 11:51.371
Do you really think we
can make a difference?

11:51.372 --> 11:53.078
If I didn't, I wouldn't be going.

11:53.231 --> 11:56.187
- It didn't before.
- That was another time.

11:57.694 --> 11:59.320
Come with me, John.

12:04.327 --> 12:08.157
I don't know what you think
about this place, but I like it.

12:08.622 --> 12:13.287
I like bein' here, I like workin'
here. I like belong into something.

12:13.335 --> 12:16.005
You DO belong into something. Not this.

12:17.549 --> 12:19.105
When you're gonna come full circle?

12:19.523 --> 12:20.976
What are you talkin' about?

12:21.969 --> 12:25.469
You said that your war is over.
I think the one out there is,

12:25.932 --> 12:27.971
but not the one inside you.

12:28.435 --> 12:31.636
I know the reasons you're here, John.
But it doesn't work that way.

12:32.073 --> 12:36.140
You may try, but you can't get
away from what you really are.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.477
And what is it I am?

12:37.478 --> 12:39.077
A full-blooded combat soldier.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.526
Not any more. I dont want it.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.815
That's too bad, 'cause
you're stuck with it.

12:44.492 --> 12:45.950
Let me tell you a story, John.

12:46.410 --> 12:50.455
There was a sculptor and he
found a stone, a special stone.

12:50.915 --> 12:52.914
He dragged it home and he
worked on it for months,

12:52.915 --> 12:54.600
until he finally finished.

12:55.335 --> 12:57.420
When he was ready, he
showed it to his friends,

12:57.422 --> 12:59.506
and they said he had
created a great statue.

13:00.006 --> 13:01.921
The sculptor said he
hadn't created anything.

13:01.922 --> 13:04.253
The statue was always there.

13:04.711 --> 13:07.318
He just cleared away to small pieces.

13:08.725 --> 13:10.976
We didn't make you
this fighting machine.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.760
We just shifted away the rough edges.

13:15.231 --> 13:17.447
Your own is gonna be
tearing away with yourself,

13:17.448 --> 13:19.663
until you come to terms
with what you are!

13:20.529 --> 13:22.273
Until you come full circle.

13:25.116 --> 13:27.238
I guess I'm not ready yet.

13:32.832 --> 13:34.659
Well, I got to move.

13:37.003 --> 13:40.501
Promise me you'll look me
when you're next in the States.

13:41.341 --> 13:42.539
I promise.

13:43.092 --> 13:44.469
Colonel!

13:45.179 --> 13:48.797
I'm sorry. But it's gotta
end for me sometime.

13:51.791 --> 13:52.834
I understand.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.389
Take cover!

15:43.507 --> 15:46.606
Drop your weapons and
remain where you are!

15:47.969 --> 15:49.760
You cannot escape!

15:55.184 --> 15:57.011
Drop your weapons!

15:57.479 --> 15:59.103
You have no chance of escape!

16:01.275 --> 16:03.017
Drop your weapons!

16:03.526 --> 16:04.522
Now!

16:30.590 --> 16:31.528
Rambo!

16:33.619 --> 16:35.025
Something went wrong.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.263
What happened?

16:36.891 --> 16:39.118
Soviets intercepted the
team, just over the border.

16:40.898 --> 16:43.649
Among we've gathered,
Trautman and the rest of his party

16:43.650 --> 16:45.984
have been taken to the
regional commandment post.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.225
And what are you doing about it?

16:49.782 --> 16:51.282
I can't do anything about it.

16:51.909 --> 16:53.056
I'm sorry.

16:53.536 --> 16:55.795
I just thought you should know.

16:57.664 --> 16:58.966
What about me?

17:01.417 --> 17:02.663
About you?

17:02.664 --> 17:04.325
Can you get me in?

17:04.796 --> 17:06.021
You're not serious.

17:06.232 --> 17:07.666
Oh yeah, I'm serious.

17:10.385 --> 17:11.676
It can't be done officially.

17:11.678 --> 17:13.281
Make it unofficial.

17:14.681 --> 17:18.017
If it can be done, I want you to
know upfront of your capture,

17:18.727 --> 17:19.972
or any of this leaks,

17:20.436 --> 17:24.388
we'll deny any participation, or
even knowledge of your existence.

17:25.901 --> 17:27.311
I'm used to it.

17:28.904 --> 17:30.279
We'll get back.

18:55.450 --> 18:58.635
You want to buy? Many guns here!

18:58.954 --> 19:01.701
No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.

19:02.625 --> 19:05.791
- What's your name?
- John Rambo.

19:08.755 --> 19:09.952
Wait here.

19:32.863 --> 19:34.061
They sell many in Afghanistan.

19:36.825 --> 19:38.282
Many landmines.

19:38.743 --> 19:40.202
Landmines everywhere.

19:42.122 --> 19:44.621
I am Mousa Chanin.
What is it you want?

19:44.726 --> 19:46.079
I was sent by Griggs.

19:47.711 --> 19:50.208
You do not look like
men Griggs sent before.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.705
You not look like you are with military.

19:53.509 --> 19:54.777
I'm not.

19:54.987 --> 19:56.672
What you are? A mercenary?

19:58.431 --> 19:59.866
No.

19:59.972 --> 20:01.628
You're not a military, you're
not a mercenary, what are you?

20:02.150 --> 20:03.492
Lost tourist?

20:09.692 --> 20:11.481
I'm not a tourist.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.317
Sorry.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.046
Do you know where the American is?

20:16.198 --> 20:18.778
Yes. In a Soviet fort.

20:19.159 --> 20:22.778
Near the village of Khost,
30 miles over the border.

20:23.247 --> 20:26.021
Mr. Griggs sent you the
supplies you asked for.

20:26.708 --> 20:27.750
You wish to see them now?

20:28.169 --> 20:29.106
Yeah.

20:32.005 --> 20:33.313
Is this what you asked for?

20:34.044 --> 20:35.039
Yeah.

20:35.593 --> 20:38.084
Never seen these things
before. What are these?

20:38.554 --> 20:41.092
- Detonators.
- And this?

20:42.183 --> 20:43.464
What is this for?

20:44.811 --> 20:46.246
It's blue light.

20:46.247 --> 20:47.682
What does it do?

20:48.482 --> 20:50.313
It turns blue.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.355
I see.

20:53.026 --> 20:55.131
Can you tell me how many
more men come with us?

20:55.279 --> 20:57.271
There's no rescue team. There's just me.

20:58.029 --> 20:59.906
Just you? Come on, this is no good!

21:00.011 --> 21:01.992
I can not take only one man to the fort.

21:01.993 --> 21:03.974
You need more men to help.

21:04.498 --> 21:07.201
Griggs said you'd take
me there. Take me there!

21:07.834 --> 21:09.808
I am meant to take medical supplies,

21:09.809 --> 21:12.096
if I not take it, many people will die.

21:12.254 --> 21:13.630
Do you understand?

21:15.217 --> 21:17.174
Well, I do not know who you really are,

21:17.635 --> 21:20.823
but by the way you look, I can see
you have no experience in war. Do you?

21:22.181 --> 21:23.462
Come on, do you?

21:24.641 --> 21:26.655
I've fired a few shots.

21:30.147 --> 21:31.785
A few shots?

21:32.775 --> 21:35.483
Come on, maybe you should go back home,

21:35.484 --> 21:37.148
and think it all over again.

21:37.405 --> 21:38.714
For a very long time.

21:43.119 --> 21:44.946
I did think it over.

21:46.163 --> 21:48.120
You did?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.325
Well, this is your choice.

21:51.794 --> 21:55.211
But let me tell you, you can
not get this American alone.

21:56.299 --> 21:58.969
If you fail, do not blame me.

21:59.427 --> 22:01.178
I will accept no responsibility.

22:03.764 --> 22:05.283
Sounds familiar.

22:39.967 --> 22:44.095
My name is Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.

22:48.144 --> 22:52.271
You're here as the first
American captured in Afghanistan.

22:53.022 --> 22:54.766
Congratulations.

22:56.359 --> 22:59.269
I believe you're planning to
supply enemy rebels forces

22:59.322 --> 23:03.258
with Stinger missiles, intending
to destroy Soviet aircraft.

23:03.952 --> 23:05.244
If I'm gonna be interrogated,

23:05.349 --> 23:07.996
I wanna be interrogated
by your superiors.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.916
Out here, I have no superiors.

23:14.754 --> 23:16.243
I am in full command.

23:18.424 --> 23:20.315
You're alone here.

23:24.681 --> 23:26.840
Abandoned by your government.

23:28.392 --> 23:32.140
- What do you want?
- Cooperation.

23:34.961 --> 23:39.296
This sector has been under
total control for over five years.

23:41.072 --> 23:43.777
There's little more I can do here.

23:44.493 --> 23:48.671
It is, as you say, without challenges.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.231
If you supply to me
worth information about most

23:54.232 --> 23:56.669
stinger missiles
you're planning to deliver,

23:56.922 --> 23:59.694
it could provide a way
out of this further post.

24:00.925 --> 24:04.627
After all, the end what
everyone really wants...

24:06.680 --> 24:07.844
...is peace.

24:08.474 --> 24:10.301
The Kremlin's got a hell
of a sense of humor.

24:11.936 --> 24:13.099
Please explain.

24:13.605 --> 24:16.167
You talk peace and
disarmament to the world,

24:16.168 --> 24:18.731
and here you are, wiping
out a race of people.

24:19.194 --> 24:22.195
We are wiping out no one.

24:22.822 --> 24:27.234
I think you're too intelligent
to believe such a propaganda!

24:28.411 --> 24:30.571
Now again: where are the missiles?

24:30.622 --> 24:32.140
I don't know anything
about any missiles!

24:32.141 --> 24:33.658
Of course you do!

24:34.126 --> 24:37.399
But you do not seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both.

24:37.545 --> 24:39.376
You expect sympathy?

24:40.340 --> 24:42.464
You started this damn war,
now you have to deal with it!

24:42.717 --> 24:47.117
And we will. It is just a matter of time
before we achieve a complete victory.

24:47.265 --> 24:48.545
You know there won't be a victory.

24:49.201 --> 24:52.388
Everyday, your war machines lose
ground to a bunch of poorly armed,

24:52.852 --> 24:54.471
poorly equiped freedom-fighters!

24:54.729 --> 24:57.435
The fact is that you
underestimated your competition.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.322
If you studied your History,

24:59.323 --> 25:01.042
you'd know this people
never gave up to anyone.

25:01.194 --> 25:05.152
They'd rather die than be
slaves to an invading army.

25:05.407 --> 25:07.156
You can't defeat a people like that.

25:07.826 --> 25:10.849
We tried. We already had our Vietnam!

25:12.081 --> 25:13.952
Now you're gonna have yours!

25:13.999 --> 25:17.788
So, you wish to test me. Good.

25:57.209 --> 25:58.622
This is Afghanistan.

26:00.129 --> 26:02.377
Alexander the Great tried
to conquer this country,

26:02.673 --> 26:06.727
then Ghenghis Khan, then
the British, now Russia.

26:07.824 --> 26:10.555
But Afghan people fight
hard, they never be defeated.

26:11.890 --> 26:15.328
Ancient enemy make prayer about
these people. Do you wish to hear?

26:16.605 --> 26:19.356
Very good. It says:

26:19.816 --> 26:22.058
"May God deliver us from
the venom of the cobra,

26:22.527 --> 26:25.859
teeth of the tiger, and the
vengeance of the Afghans."

26:27.865 --> 26:29.276
Understand what this means?

26:31.077 --> 26:34.079
That you guys don't take any shit.

26:34.831 --> 26:37.286
Yes, something like this.

26:42.295 --> 26:43.245
We go now!

27:18.290 --> 27:21.162
In the north, there are many
caves, we'll travel through them.

27:21.961 --> 27:24.002
It'll be safer. We go!

27:28.594 --> 27:30.965
This cave leads to the
"Valley of the Five Lions".

27:31.596 --> 27:36.306
The Afghan King was asked to send
500 of his warriors into battle.

27:36.768 --> 27:38.392
He sent only five.

27:41.272 --> 27:44.060
His greatest five, and they won.

27:44.526 --> 27:47.610
He said, it's better to send
five lions than 500 sheep.

27:48.071 --> 27:51.240
- What do you think of this?
- I think the King was lucky.

27:53.494 --> 27:57.110
- How much longer till the village?
- About two hours.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.550
Where in my sector are the
missiles being delivered?

28:15.600 --> 28:16.845
I don't know.

28:17.768 --> 28:19.263
You liar.

28:22.439 --> 28:23.435
Where?

28:27.151 --> 28:28.397
Where?

28:29.155 --> 28:30.779
OK, I'll tell ya.

28:32.742 --> 28:35.411
I knew you were lying.

28:35.870 --> 28:39.594
Now, where are the missiles located?

28:41.459 --> 28:42.740
Close.

28:43.462 --> 28:44.576
How close?

28:46.881 --> 28:48.078
In your ass!

29:01.020 --> 29:04.104
You've tried my patience long enough.

29:11.845 --> 29:14.216
I tried to be civilian.

29:46.378 --> 29:47.956
The name John Rambo...

29:52.969 --> 29:54.885
...do you know it?

29:56.638 --> 29:57.634
No?

29:58.932 --> 30:01.328
He says that there's a
plan for a rescue attempt

30:01.329 --> 30:03.726
with the help of some of the rebels.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.186
He also says he knows
where this man is going.

30:12.195 --> 30:13.440
We will welcome him.

30:32.383 --> 30:35.966
It's the last village in the
valley. About 200 man here.

30:38.264 --> 30:39.953
There's a lot of lot of kids in.

30:40.162 --> 30:42.476
Yes, and they are good fighters, too.

30:42.936 --> 30:45.034
I'll tell the leaders you want to talk.

30:51.861 --> 30:53.689
They've never seen men look like you.

31:01.329 --> 31:02.517
Here are Mujahedin horsemen.

31:02.518 --> 31:05.789
There are 10.000 horsemen
more waiting at the border.

31:06.375 --> 31:07.790
They are waiting to get
weapons, when they'll get it,

31:07.791 --> 31:09.728
they'll come back here to fight.

31:28.981 --> 31:30.560
Let's go to the hospital.

31:36.115 --> 31:38.157
He is the only doctor for 500 km.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.362
The first medicine they
get in two months.

31:53.673 --> 31:57.457
More gifts from the Soviets. They
look like toys, but they're mines.

31:57.927 --> 32:00.179
We teach the childrens not to
touch, some of them too late.

32:04.768 --> 32:06.310
Who's that?

32:06.770 --> 32:08.846
His name is Juri. He's Russian.

32:09.314 --> 32:10.522
A deserter?

32:10.523 --> 32:12.981
He calls himself a defector.
There are many like him.

32:13.444 --> 32:17.508
He is the one who can help the most,
he knows the inside of the fort.

32:21.493 --> 32:23.115
I think we should go now.

32:42.890 --> 32:48.809
Mines start here: one meter like
this, then two meters like this,

32:49.271 --> 32:50.468
and like this.

32:50.939 --> 32:53.561
There are four towers, four guards,

32:54.027 --> 32:57.146
here, here, here and here.

32:57.739 --> 32:58.926
Where do they keep the prisoners?

32:59.344 --> 33:00.530
Here.

33:01.409 --> 33:04.612
If we get in there,
is there another way out?

33:05.413 --> 33:07.875
Underground, where
there's all dirty water.

33:08.541 --> 33:10.747
But I do not know word for this place.

33:11.211 --> 33:13.535
He means sewer. Where is it?

33:14.004 --> 33:18.298
Here. Outside, you go there.
Guards patrolls there.

33:19.135 --> 33:20.962
I do not think you go this way.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.802
I wish we go to the minefields.
They'll never expect it.

33:24.266 --> 33:28.448
This can not be done.
There are many Spetnaz commandos.

33:29.228 --> 33:31.958
We have all of this,
we've lost many men.

33:32.941 --> 33:34.046
We'll lose more men if we go there.

33:35.089 --> 33:36.818
I don't need many men.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.529
What is it you want to do?

33:40.907 --> 33:42.115
I need two men to lead
me to the minefield,

33:42.116 --> 33:43.740
and two to help to escape.

33:44.201 --> 33:47.369
If this is done, Soviets
will come here like before,

33:47.831 --> 33:48.892
and more people will die.

33:49.935 --> 33:51.205
I can't wait.

33:51.876 --> 33:54.331
You must wait for help the way we wait.

33:56.589 --> 33:59.210
- Then I'll go alone.
- And you will die!

34:02.220 --> 34:03.880
Then I'll die.

34:09.268 --> 34:10.431
Wait!

34:11.938 --> 34:13.266
Please don't go.

34:21.406 --> 34:22.864
My name is Masoud.

34:24.367 --> 34:25.492
You must not judge us,

34:25.493 --> 34:28.389
before you understand why
we are not directed to help.

34:31.083 --> 34:33.158
Most of the Afghan
people are very strong,

34:33.627 --> 34:36.581
and we are determined not
to be driven from our land.

34:38.090 --> 34:42.235
Our children die of disease,
mines, and poison gas.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.841
And our women are raped and killed.

34:46.514 --> 34:50.844
Last year, in the valley of
Legman, the next valley,

34:51.313 --> 34:52.748
6.000 Afghans were killed.

34:54.773 --> 34:57.395
Pregnant women were cut with bayonets,

34:58.901 --> 35:01.191
and their babies thrown into the fire.

35:01.988 --> 35:06.319
This is done, so they will not have to
fight the next generation of Afghans.

35:06.786 --> 35:10.237
Yet nobody sees anything, or
reads anything in the papers.

35:11.790 --> 35:13.285
What you see here,

35:14.793 --> 35:16.832
are the Mujahedin soldiers,

35:17.337 --> 35:18.713
holy warriors.

35:19.173 --> 35:22.009
To us, this war is a holy war.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.965
And there is no true
death for a Mujahedin,

35:24.966 --> 35:27.462
because we have taken our last nights,

35:27.932 --> 35:30.803
and because we consider us already dead.

35:31.769 --> 35:35.304
To us, death for our
land and God is an honor.

35:35.773 --> 35:37.138
So, my friend,

35:38.651 --> 35:43.147
what we must do is to stop this
killing of our women and children.

35:44.992 --> 35:47.024
If getting this man free,

35:47.716 --> 35:53.763
so he can tells to the free world, and
tell what happens here, is necessary

35:53.812 --> 35:55.581
then of course we will help.

35:57.921 --> 36:02.547
Leave us now, so we may
speak among ourselves

36:03.010 --> 36:05.546
and find the best way to free this man.

36:11.309 --> 36:13.979
- Thank you.
- We thank you.

36:38.170 --> 36:41.124
Don't worry, they will decide soon.

36:41.589 --> 36:43.943
- We got to leave tonight.
- What is your name?

36:47.637 --> 36:49.963
This boy is very hard inside.

36:50.432 --> 36:52.011
His parents were killed last year.

36:53.519 --> 36:56.188
His brother died in the
fort where the American is.

36:56.647 --> 36:59.600
He looks like a boy, but
he fights like a man.

37:00.066 --> 37:02.391
- What's your name?
- Rambo.

37:02.861 --> 37:05.696
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.

37:06.157 --> 37:07.967
Arizona? How much days walk?

37:09.219 --> 37:10.403
About two years.

37:10.869 --> 37:12.115
Two years...

37:13.622 --> 37:16.279
- Are you a soldier?
- No more.

37:17.792 --> 37:20.628
I am a soldier. Are you here to fight?

37:21.088 --> 37:23.248
- No.
- Are you scared?

37:26.343 --> 37:28.715
What is this?

37:29.180 --> 37:30.200
It's a knife.

37:30.201 --> 37:31.847
- Can I see this?
- Sure.

37:39.773 --> 37:41.148
Very good. Can I have it?

37:41.607 --> 37:42.603
No.

37:44.778 --> 37:46.771
- What is this?
- You want everything!

37:47.240 --> 37:49.861
- This is for luck.
- What is luck?

37:50.325 --> 37:51.819
Luck is...

37:54.037 --> 37:55.846
Can I have it? I need luck.

37:55.847 --> 37:57.657
So do I!

38:01.212 --> 38:04.545
What a child! Always like this.

38:07.592 --> 38:10.345
Look there! It's our national sport.

38:10.804 --> 38:13.360
An old, insane game,
maybe 3.000 years old!

38:14.558 --> 38:15.886
Look, they never stop playing.

38:19.939 --> 38:22.040
War or not war, they don't mind.

38:23.027 --> 38:25.778
- You like it?
- I'll take football.

38:26.237 --> 38:29.403
What is football? You
play it with the foot?

38:29.865 --> 38:31.027
Not really.

38:41.962 --> 38:43.336
Come on, let's go!

38:55.184 --> 38:58.137
- What are they saying?
- They want you to try.

38:58.603 --> 39:02.470
It's a way to them for you to be with
them. If you want to try, go ahead but

39:02.941 --> 39:05.312
I'm not responsible for it!

39:09.406 --> 39:11.482
- I'll try it.
- Yes?

39:13.451 --> 39:14.593
What are the rules?

39:14.698 --> 39:17.300
Well, you have to take
the sheep once around,

39:17.456 --> 39:20.243
and then thrown it in the circle.

39:20.834 --> 39:21.891
Why?

39:21.996 --> 39:23.158
Because there is a circle there.

39:25.421 --> 39:27.710
- That's it?
- That's it! Very simple.

39:29.947 --> 39:31.506
Like football.

39:31.507 --> 39:33.796
God must love crazy people!

39:34.639 --> 39:36.993
- Why?
- He makes so many of them!

47:15.731 --> 47:17.639
Now you see how it is here.

47:19.025 --> 47:21.978
Somewhere in a war,
there's supposed to be honor.

47:22.445 --> 47:24.901
Where is the honor here? Where?

47:27.951 --> 47:30.738
We're taking the survivors to
the border. Are you coming?

47:32.372 --> 47:33.652
I'm going to the fort.

47:34.123 --> 47:36.448
Have you not seen enough death?

47:37.211 --> 47:41.790
Go away while you can.
This is not your war.

47:44.967 --> 47:46.593
It is now.

47:50.432 --> 47:53.267
So be it.

47:53.727 --> 47:55.055
You are a good friend.

48:05.657 --> 48:08.147
I stay. I will show you the way.

48:08.618 --> 48:09.945
I will go too.

48:11.077 --> 48:12.108
No, you go with them.

48:12.579 --> 48:17.076
I will not. They killed all
my family. I want to fight!

48:18.210 --> 48:20.784
Not with me. You go!

48:22.298 --> 48:23.293
Go on.

48:28.679 --> 48:30.091
Why must you do this?

48:32.142 --> 48:34.015
Cause he'd do it for me.

48:59.836 --> 49:01.792
Are you decided to talk?

49:02.879 --> 49:03.875
No?

49:05.257 --> 49:06.205
Very well.

49:07.467 --> 49:11.513
Soon you will be my
guest down the hall...

50:43.399 --> 50:44.679
- Go back!
- No!

50:45.151 --> 50:46.182
Go back!

51:15.097 --> 51:16.378
Go on!

51:18.392 --> 51:19.660
Stay here! Stay back.

51:19.661 --> 51:21.346
I know this place. You need me!

51:21.812 --> 51:24.517
I don't need you dead!
Now go back. You understand?

58:27.784 --> 58:28.815
American?

58:30.412 --> 58:31.657
American?

58:54.103 --> 58:55.811
Colonel? Colonel?

59:02.152 --> 59:04.229
John? How the hell did you get in here?

59:04.698 --> 59:07.532
- Can you move?
- I can.

59:09.576 --> 59:10.775
Let's go!

59:15.748 --> 59:16.726
John, behind you!

59:27.553 --> 59:29.095
Go!

59:34.686 --> 59:36.891
John, get out of here!
Get the hell outta here!

01:01:34.036 --> 01:01:35.826
Over here!

01:01:36.286 --> 01:01:37.200
Come on!

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:45.505
Help me!

01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:21.958
Take him!

01:02:43.521 --> 01:02:44.518
Come on!

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:49.855
Give me the boy!

01:03:09.672 --> 01:03:11.166
Come!

01:03:23.312 --> 01:03:24.177
Come on!

01:03:26.315 --> 01:03:27.479
Take the kid!

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.019
Jump down!

01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:48.095
Give me the boy!

01:05:42.327 --> 01:05:46.372
Who is this terrorist? What
makes you so valuable to him?

01:05:46.831 --> 01:05:50.491
This bastard tried to destroy
me tonight. But he failed!

01:05:50.752 --> 01:05:55.000
At sunrise, I will track him down, and
have his skin hanging on the wall!

01:05:55.466 --> 01:05:58.669
- You don't have to hunt him.
- What?

01:05:59.137 --> 01:06:00.714
He'll find you.

01:06:03.932 --> 01:06:06.175
Are you insane?

01:06:06.645 --> 01:06:09.729
One man against trained commandos?

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:13.854
Who do you think this man is? God?

01:06:15.778 --> 01:06:19.028
No. God would have mercy. He won't!

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.401
It's all right. There's nobody there.

01:06:35.507 --> 01:06:36.402
Good.

01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:37.609
This will hold a while.

01:06:39.173 --> 01:06:40.650
What's the fastest way outta here?

01:06:41.324 --> 01:06:43.971
Northwest, there's a
trail between mountains,

01:06:44.224 --> 01:06:48.056
about three kilometers from
here. The trail is very difficult.

01:06:50.063 --> 01:06:52.932
- You take the boy and go.
- I want to stay.

01:06:53.482 --> 01:06:54.870
You can't.

01:06:56.736 --> 01:06:59.904
You can not go back there.
We must all go to Pakistan.

01:07:00.574 --> 01:07:02.258
No, I gotta go back.

01:07:02.781 --> 01:07:04.986
I know he's your friend,
but you can't do this!

01:07:05.453 --> 01:07:08.033
You both will die.
For what? Come with us!

01:07:08.138 --> 01:07:09.153
Just do what I say.

01:07:11.709 --> 01:07:14.247
Give me your gun.

01:07:19.509 --> 01:07:22.379
All right, let's go. Come on!

01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:41.606
I will see you again?

01:07:42.366 --> 01:07:43.362
Sure.

01:13:40.644 --> 01:13:42.019
Come on!

01:13:53.324 --> 01:13:54.449
Can you fly that thing?

01:13:55.075 --> 01:13:55.990
Let's find out.

01:14:20.726 --> 01:14:22.386
Let's go!

01:14:49.422 --> 01:14:50.702
Hold on!

01:15:00.975 --> 01:15:02.469
Over there!

01:15:08.316 --> 01:15:09.265
There!

01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:30.163
Hold on!

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:31.959
Get him up!

01:15:32.425 --> 01:15:34.381
Take my hand!

01:15:58.909 --> 01:15:59.857
We're going down!

01:16:15.468 --> 01:16:16.333
Hold on!

01:16:32.944 --> 01:16:34.567
Take what you can!

01:16:35.028 --> 01:16:37.520
- Come on, move it, move it!
- Go on!

01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:52.285
- We gotta hit the border.
- We stay here.

01:16:52.755 --> 01:16:54.213
We know where to go.

01:16:54.673 --> 01:16:57.674
- Which direction, John?
- Northeast!

01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:47.261
Hold it, John!

01:17:50.605 --> 01:17:52.227
I gotta rest a minute.

01:17:54.442 --> 01:17:55.441
How's your wound?

01:17:56.484 --> 01:17:58.523
You taught us to ignore
the pain, didn't ya?

01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:00.215
Has it worked?

01:18:01.674 --> 01:18:02.691
Not really!

01:18:04.243 --> 01:18:05.862
Don't take it personally!

01:18:07.538 --> 01:18:08.533
Thanks.

01:18:29.228 --> 01:18:31.897
You go on ahead and see if
you can find some cover.

01:19:44.137 --> 01:19:46.546
That was close, John! How are you?

01:19:47.431 --> 01:19:48.803
Well done!

01:20:00.278 --> 01:20:03.362
We won't make it easy for them.
We'd better split out!

01:20:04.657 --> 01:20:06.815
I'm sorry I got you into this, John!

01:20:07.284 --> 01:20:08.862
No, you're not!

01:21:09.472 --> 01:21:12.842
- Are you listening?
- Who are you?

01:21:14.228 --> 01:21:16.434
Your worst nightmare.

01:23:10.512 --> 01:23:11.509
It's good timing!

01:23:12.031 --> 01:23:13.027
What are friends for?

01:23:15.331 --> 01:23:17.834
You go back to the hole. I'll cover
you, and see if there's any more left.

01:26:35.386 --> 01:26:37.361
Across the valley is the border.

01:26:39.598 --> 01:26:40.922
We did it, John!

01:26:43.393 --> 01:26:44.674
Wait!

01:26:48.608 --> 01:26:50.647
What the hell is that?

01:26:54.028 --> 01:26:55.488
The son of a bitch!

01:27:21.431 --> 01:27:23.840
Do not try to retreat!

01:27:24.392 --> 01:27:25.769
You can not escape.

01:27:26.228 --> 01:27:28.553
We will not attack if you do not run!

01:27:29.231 --> 01:27:30.498
We do not want to hurt you.

01:27:31.542 --> 01:27:32.600
Somehow I don't believe him!

01:27:33.069 --> 01:27:37.066
I order you to come forward,
and you will be given a fair trial.

01:27:37.531 --> 01:27:40.088
Drop your weapons,
and remain where you are.

01:27:40.243 --> 01:27:42.034
You got any ideas?

01:27:43.412 --> 01:27:45.784
Drop your weapons!

01:27:46.456 --> 01:27:48.177
Surrounding them, Sir.

01:27:49.835 --> 01:27:52.458
Helluva time for humor, John!

01:27:52.922 --> 01:27:55.330
Drop your weapons! Now!

01:27:56.843 --> 01:27:58.503
You have no chance of escape.

01:27:58.970 --> 01:28:02.753
Come forward! I want
to pick you back alive.

01:28:03.223 --> 01:28:05.431
This is your last warning!

01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:09.934
The choice is yours.

01:28:10.398 --> 01:28:12.057
What do you say, John?

01:28:14.276 --> 01:28:16.320
Fuck 'em!

01:28:34.549 --> 01:28:37.038
If we're gonna go, I would
crave to take that bastard with us!

01:29:15.172 --> 01:29:16.287
What is that?

01:29:26.309 --> 01:29:28.016
It's the rebels!

01:29:40.656 --> 01:29:41.438
Come on!

01:33:26.468 --> 01:33:27.381
John, get out of there!

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.940
You're sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist!

01:35:09.906 --> 01:35:11.339
Maybe next time.

01:35:12.742 --> 01:35:14.366
Do you want this back?

01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:17.984
No. You keep it.

01:35:18.705 --> 01:35:20.366
Can you not stay?

01:35:34.181 --> 01:35:35.509
I gotta go.

01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:01.701
Goodbye.

01:36:09.882 --> 01:36:10.943
Hard to believe, John!

01:36:11.777 --> 01:36:12.733
What's that, Sir?

01:36:13.094 --> 01:36:17.341
Well, I hate to admit it, but the
truth is I think we're getting soft!

01:36:18.850 --> 01:36:20.469
Maybe just a little, Sir...

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.659
Just a little!
