14:51.264 --> 14:52.755

14:52.780 --> 14:53.584
- Sure thing.
- So I can...

14:53.609 --> 14:54.645
Absolutely.

14:54.670 --> 14:57.118

Yes. Oh, my God. Of

15:00.099 --> 15:02.722
- It's like driving a car.
- It looks really nice.

15:02.747 --> 15:04.538

15:05.931 --> 15:08.098
- Oh.
- This very special moment.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.467
So I get to do something that
I ra... very rarely get to do:

15:12.492 --> 15:14.126
watch a negotiation.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.677
And it's not an inexpensive figure.

15:16.702 --> 15:20.068
Uh, I'm asking $200 for it in the box.

15:20.768 --> 15:22.535
See, the thing about Megos is,

15:22.560 --> 15:24.320
they're very desirable.

15:24.345 --> 15:27.123
With just the retro, vintage everything

15:27.148 --> 15:30.186
coming up the the world,
they've gotten more expensive.

15:30.289 --> 15:34.116
I was hoping maybe, like, the $100 area.

15:34.544 --> 15:35.792
Um, I could

15:35.894 --> 15:38.461
possibly come down to, uh, $175.

15:38.610 --> 15:41.257
Well, Robert, I mean, you got
to take into consideration,

15:41.282 --> 15:42.999
you know, the lid's off the box.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.837
- True.
- I love this.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.571
You never get to see anyone negotiate.

15:46.596 --> 15:48.038
I never get to see anyone
play devil's advocate.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.173
- [laughter]
- Oh, my gosh.

15:50.568 --> 15:55.612
So, um, maybe $125?

15:56.241 --> 15:59.950
I... my... my bottom line
on this would be $140.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.918
I mean, I know the box has wear on it,

16:01.943 --> 16:03.787
