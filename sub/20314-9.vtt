-Please.

00:06.709 --> 00:09.709
-Morning, how is everyone?
-Ms. Turdie.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.041
-What the hell is that?
-It's a breast pump.

00:12.083 --> 00:16.166
I have an appointment after
school, so I'm just making a
little snack for baby Logan.

00:16.208 --> 00:18.542
-Aw.
-You're doing that in
the staff room?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.750
-Why not?
-[Robert]: Yeah Gerry, why not?

00:20.792 --> 00:23.458
I happen to think it's great
that Xavier is a pump positive
environment.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.750
-It's disgusting.
Can you do that somewhere else?

00:25.792 --> 00:27.959
-What are ya?
Lactate intolerant?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
-Look, this is a staff room,
not a farm...

00:31.208 --> 00:33.834
With some milk being sucked
out of a teat by a machine.

00:33.875 --> 00:37.583
-Gerry! Maybe you're not
aware of the health benefits.

00:37.625 --> 00:40.417
Breast milk is an excellent
source of nutrition.

00:40.458 --> 00:44.458
Vitamin C, amino acids,
magnesium, love.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
Put a little top up?
-No, no, don't do that.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.250
-[Emma]: Sure.
-No, no I'm gonna throw up.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.208
-[Emma]: Sure, Robert, sure.
-[Robert]: A little squirt?

00:51.250 --> 00:54.125
-[Gerry]: Oh god, don't do that.
No, no, no, no. That's not
allowed.

00:54.166 --> 00:56.667
-[Sound of milk hitting coffee]
-Just one more little squirt.

00:56.709 --> 01:00.250
Thank you, my milk maid.
-Oh my god!

01:00.291 --> 01:02.417
No, don't! Ugh!

01:02.458 --> 01:05.291
-[Robert]: Mmmmmm.
-What a baby.

01:05.333 --> 01:09.250
-Are you, um, ami-breasterous?
Like, can you do both?

-Robert, are you okay?

02:12.959 --> 02:15.291
-Just trying to get into
my chess club jacket.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.583
'Cause my high school reunion's
coming up this weekend.

02:17.625 --> 02:20.417
-Robert, no one expects you
to fit in a jacket from 20...

02:20.458 --> 02:23.500
Pounds ago.
-Your chess club had a jacket?

02:23.542 --> 02:26.458
-Yeah. Well, we were more
like a gang than a club I guess.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.625
We called ourselves The Queens.
[Sings]: Da da da gork.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.792
-Wow!
-Pretty tough.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.959
-It might be better that you
don't fit into it.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.792
-Why? I need Vanessa Moogliano
to see me in this jacket.

02:37.834 --> 02:40.875
-Oh, the one that got away?
-Technically, the one I never
had.

02:40.917 --> 02:43.333
She turned me down when I
asked her to the Knights and
Rooks dance.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.542
-Awww, so you've been carrying
a torch for her all these years?

02:45.583 --> 02:51.000
-Hell no, I just want her to
want me now, so that I can shun
her back and make it even.

02:51.041 --> 02:54.458
How do I do that?
-What I find attractive is
confidence.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.667
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.000
-Well, if I had the old
Callaghan bod, I'd be more
confident.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.500
So, which came first, the
chicken or the abs? You know?

03:01.542 --> 03:04.417
-You want to lose weight?
You should come with me to
hot yoga after school.

03:04.458 --> 03:06.917
We'll do it the old fashioned
way, we'll sweat it off.

03:06.959 --> 03:09.208
-I only have a few days,
the reunion's this weekend.

03:09.250 --> 03:12.083
-All the more reason to get
started. I'll see you at 4:15.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.500
-Okay, I'm in.

03:14.542 --> 03:17.583
Can you do me a favour? Can you
give me a hand with this jacket?

03:17.625 --> 03:19.917
-Sure, jacket on? Or jacket off?

03:20.917 --> 03:22.959
-Sir...

03:23.000 --> 03:25.542
-Hey, guess who I ran into
outside the school?

03:25.583 --> 03:27.458
-Mmm, could it fit in a
breadbox?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.709
-No, it's a person, they can't
fit in a breadbox.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.875
-Tell that to Chandra
Bahadur Dhangi.
-Who?

03:31.917 --> 03:34.291
-World's shortest man,
he's 55 centimetres tall.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.458
He'd definitely fit in a
breadbox.
-[Gerry sighs]

03:36.500 --> 03:39.083
-You could probably fit a piece
of bread in there too.
For a blanket.

03:39.125 --> 03:41.583
-Okay, Simon I'm done.
I ran into Heather.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.917
Heather's a girl I dated
ten years ago.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.417
-How tall is she?
-Would you stop thinking
of the breadbox?

03:46.458 --> 03:48.375
-Okay, what was she doing here?

03:48.417 --> 03:51.500
-Listen to this, she's got a
daughter at this school,
in grade five.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.750
You know how awkward that was?
-Hmmm.

03:53.792 --> 03:56.375
-Wait a second...
She is nine...

03:57.625 --> 03:59.500
We dated ten years ago...

03:59.542 --> 04:02.542
And the daughter had
blonde hair, blue eyes.

04:02.583 --> 04:05.375
Oh my god...
Oh my god!

04:05.417 --> 04:08.291
You don't think...
-No, I don't think she'd
fit in that breadbox.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.792
-No, not the bread...!
-More than twice Chandra's
height.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.500
-[Gerry]: No, this is..No...
-I'd have to see her though.

04:19.542 --> 04:21.542

-How would you like to support
the arts for only five bucks?

04:26.458 --> 04:30.458
-Wow, you have a new single out.
I didn't know you'd put your
band back together.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.667
-I didn't, I'm a solo act.
-Ah.

04:32.709 --> 04:35.417
-How many would you like?
-Well, I mean...

04:35.458 --> 04:38.417
Obviously I would love one, but
unfortunately...

04:38.458 --> 04:43.500
This is, the problem is....I am
not supposed to listen to music.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.542
Come on in Simon.
Come on in, come in.
-[Gerry]: No!

20:28.583 --> 20:32.542
-Too far?
-[Gerry]: No, go back. Go back
Simon. Simon SHE'S A GIRL!

20:32.583 --> 20:35.000
-[Jenna]: Alright, are you
ready there, princess?

20:35.041 --> 20:37.041
-[Gerry]: Oh boy.
-Let's go.

20:38.625 --> 20:42.166
-Agh! Oh my Gosh that was close.
-[Jenna]: Way, way off.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.375
-[Simon]: Good wood on
that bat, good wood.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.333
-[Simon sings to himself]
-[Gerry]: Right here!

20:48.375 --> 20:50.500
Right there, I want it right
there.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.834
[Jenna]: Alright.
-Right there, so I
can hit it.

20:55.041 --> 20:58.125
-[Jenna laughs]
-What the hell was that?
Trying to hit me.

20:58.166 --> 21:01.166
-[Jenna]: That slipped.
-[Simon gasps]

21:01.208 --> 21:04.417
[Simon gasps]: WASP!

21:06.625 --> 21:10.583
-Oh yeah. I believe that's
strike three, there, Gerry.

21:10.625 --> 21:12.583
-[Gerry]: Uggghh!

21:12.625 --> 21:15.000
-That doesn't feel very
good, does it Gerry?

21:15.041 --> 21:17.208
-Forget it.

21:17.250 --> 21:19.500
You can go home.
-Finally.
