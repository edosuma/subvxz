exactly, Mrs. Kaplan?

expect me to back him

You don't mind if I borrow Andy
for a minute?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.472
Oh, for God's sake.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.265
Shut your mouth
till you're asked a question.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.606
-Come on.
-Must have had a liberal upbringing.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.362
(DOOR CLOSES)

13:42.988 --> 13:44.240
Posture, Joey.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.078
My point I'm trying to make,
I'm the opposite, theoretically, anyway.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.831
Your drug of choice
is opposite from Special K?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.124
I'm more theoretically with meth.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.840
Appreciate you talking with me, Andy.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.968
Why don't you, uh, plunge on ahead?

14:06.345 --> 14:09.098
Look, I could, uh, kid you and, you know,

14:10.182 --> 14:14.436
tell you it's a general story, or, uh,
mid-life crisis, buh-buh-buh.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.147
The truth is, uh...

14:17.815 --> 14:20.067
I'm getting sick with some
of the aspects of my work.

14:20.317 --> 14:23.487
If you're asking do I see you
getting back on the job, I don't.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.574
Look, I know the job
is history for me, Andy.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.910
Since when have I been anything
if not realistic?

14:30.286 --> 14:32.746
Unless you're talking about the times
that I was stupid,

14:32.830 --> 14:34.874
for following my dick around
and so forth.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.001
(CLEARS THROAT) Anyways...

14:39.169 --> 14:41.171
Anyways, as far as
getting this guy some work

14:41.255 --> 14:42.298
'cause I'm banging his sister,

14:42.381 --> 14:45.134
that's not gonna keep me up nights.
It's not like I knew he was a thief.

14:46.635 --> 14:49.430
-What's keeping you up nights?
-Other stuff.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.853
Information that I'm privy to. (EXHALES)

14:58.272 --> 14:59.565
Suspicions.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.985
You know, there were times in my life...

15:04.236 --> 15:05.571
when I'd look into the mirror...

15:07.031 --> 15:09.408
and if I was in a situation
like I am right now,

15:09.533 --> 15:10.826
I'd be looking in the mirror...

15:12.328 --> 15:13.537
and I'd say to myself,

15:14.330 --> 15:17.207
"The ship has just come
in for Mrs. Roberts' favorite son."

15:18.083 --> 15:19.209
That's what I would say.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.462
The ship's come in
'cause of something you know.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.055
That would be my attitude
toward the present position that I'm in.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.765
If it didn't come along
with certain things

15:32.848 --> 15:34.224
that are making me sick right now.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.937
You want to tell me what that position is?

15:38.312 --> 15:43.025
Andy, my act was never to go looking
to hurt the weaker.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.695
And I hope to God
you at least give me that much.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.076
I know what you're thinking.

15:53.410 --> 15:57.623
You're thinking, "Oh,
what about that junkie informant

15:57.706 --> 16:00.000
"you were banging
and wound-up dead by her own hand?"

16:00.125 --> 16:01.502
Is that what you're thinking about, Andy?

16:03.545 --> 16:06.507
-I don't think you meant to hurt her.
-That's right. I did not.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.426
But that's what's
making this the<i> Titanic.</i>

16:10.010 --> 16:12.304
The ship that...
that finally come in for me.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.891
That's what's making this a death boat,
all the connections with that!

16:17.267 --> 16:18.435
What do you got, Mike?

16:21.730 --> 16:22.815
I can't.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.988
I can't.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.868
I'm gonna make that
my confession quota for the day,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.161
giving up Steve Jung.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.714
(INHALES) I'll tell you something...

16:48.048 --> 16:49.883
I'd sure like to Jimmy an elevator

16:49.967 --> 16:52.594
and get trapped alone
with that Kirkendall.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.722
Yeah, she's good-looking.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.475
You know something?

17:00.728 --> 17:02.354
If I was gonna tell anybody...

17:04.064 --> 17:05.107
I'd tell you.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.236
'Cause you always had a way
you could always break me down.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.404
Am I right?

17:11.071 --> 17:14.575
If I come in with some bogus story
or some bogus excuse,

17:15.367 --> 17:17.119
I'd always have to make sure
that I, you know,

17:17.953 --> 17:19.413
keep my eyes away from you.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.623
Did you know that?

17:25.002 --> 17:27.046
Hey, look, I know you got
a case of your own.

17:31.216 --> 17:35.512
Next time you see me, pal...
I'll be on, uh...

17:35.971 --> 17:38.807
Joyce Brothers, uh, call-in help line.

17:39.099 --> 17:44.063
Or that other fruitcake. What's her name?
You know, the, uh, the dwarf, Dr. Ruth.

17:44.813 --> 17:45.856
I'll be with her.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.029
Thank you, Andy.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.036
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

18:06.585 --> 18:08.796
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

18:10.339 --> 18:13.383
Andy, you know What a k-hole is?
You take too much Special K,

18:13.467 --> 18:15.177
you fall into a k-hole. Right, Joey?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.805
-Yeah. Which I'm not in.
-What joey's been explaining,

18:18.263 --> 18:20.766
you're in your k-hole,
you're withdrawn and depressed.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.852
-Yeah, verging on catatonic.
-Yeah, which joey is not.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.355
Joey is a big believer in crystal meth.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.816
Which joey himself admits
sometimes is prone

18:28.982 --> 18:30.150
to making him ill-humored.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.402
The point is, I'm not on Special K,

18:32.653 --> 18:34.863
which the deck you found on me
is Special K.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.658
Just trying to support
my original explanation,

18:37.866 --> 18:39.493
that I was holding
that stuff for a friend.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.745
Joey, you see me putting my jacket on?

18:42.287 --> 18:45.207
That's because I'm feeling
a tremendous credibility hit

18:45.374 --> 18:48.752
coming off you. And if you continue
to sustain that credibility hit

18:48.836 --> 18:50.879
that I'm getting from you
off the little chat

18:51.130 --> 18:52.339
that we had down the hall,

18:52.548 --> 18:54.800
then I will personally
lead you down the steps,

18:54.925 --> 18:58.178
hail a cab, in my jacket,
and send you on your merry way.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.348
Now, let's go. Detective, please.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.948
Now, let's do a walk-up start
on the deck subject, Joey, all right?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.368
When's the last time
you were at your buddy,

19:21.451 --> 19:22.995
Justin Candell's apartment?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.788
I've never been to his apartment.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.040
So, if we say a neighbor
saw you there yesterday...

19:27.124 --> 19:28.125
No.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.378
If we tell you the neighbor described you,
including your tattoos?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.422
Whoever's your witness didn't see me.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.675
Me and Justin hang out, we go to my place.
His mother's uptight.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.011
You know this although
you were never at her place.

19:39.094 --> 19:42.472
Justin's mother's a frequent subject
of Justin's conversation.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.976
Look, what the hell is this?
Are you accusing me of doing something

19:46.059 --> 19:48.228
-at Justin's mother's apartment?
-Well put.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.522
Justin's mother got robbed
yesterday, Joey.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.525
Maybe while you and Justin
were playing braille yesterday

19:53.609 --> 19:56.987
On each other's heinies,
Justin suggests you take his mom off,

19:57.279 --> 19:59.448
and he helps out
with the floor plan of her place.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.992
I did not rob Justin's mom.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.662
I don't go to Justin's mom's place,
and robbery's not my act.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.290
'Cause hustlers don't do robberies,
right, Joey?

20:08.957 --> 20:13.712
My own experience, them two combine
less than 60 to 70 percent of the time.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.592
Look, are you gonna help me on that deck,
which could've been anybody's at the bar?

20:18.842 --> 20:20.844
In exchange for what
concerning this robbery

20:20.928 --> 20:22.429
would we make the deck go away?

20:28.018 --> 20:30.562
The guy you want to talk
to just got out of Rikers.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.608
Jerry Edwards. His act is breaking in.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.527
And Justin fell in with him.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.156
Where are we gonna find Jerry
that Justin fell in with?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.158
Hustles pool on University.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.244
Gets there around three.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.412
This Jerry, he's got ink on him, too?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.122
Prison work, though. It's sloppy.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.342
Josh, could you take
that mope down to holding?

21:00.592 --> 21:01.635
Sure.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.182
Detectives, this is Seymour Epstein.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.643
In connection with the death
you're investigating.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.020
Appreciate you coming in.
I'm Danny Sorenson.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.689
This is my partner, Andy Sipowicz.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.233
-How do you do?
-Let's talk over here.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.904
He's a very civilized young man,
your receptionist.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.323
Yeah, he definitely raises the tone.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.501
I can tell you're very saddened.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.213
I went to grade school
with this woman's husband.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.800
And I've attended
to that family's legal needs

21:42.676 --> 21:43.927
for 30-some years.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.640
Mrs. Candell's sister was telling us
you executed her mother's estate.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.019
That's a very unpleasant woman,
Rita's sister.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.979
You won't get no argument here.

21:55.188 --> 21:58.025
It don't strike you she might have
organized something like this?

21:58.358 --> 21:59.901
Killing her own sister?

22:00.527 --> 22:02.529
The murder part
wouldn't have to be intended.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.949
This looks like a robbery went bad.
The sister got tied up.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.617
Vomited into the gag.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.580
Mr. Epstein, being the family lawyer,

22:11.663 --> 22:13.665
have you had any dealings
with the victim's son?

22:14.082 --> 22:15.709
Justin's a ne'er-do-well.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.837
And I certainly think
he's experimented with drugs.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.923
We don't find him
having any criminal record.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.217
That's a sentence I'd end with "yet."

22:25.260 --> 22:30.390
Three times he's broached my financing
cockamamie business ideas,

22:31.058 --> 22:34.019
and invariably he seems nearly comatose.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.107
I think Justin's getting into trouble
with the legal system,

22:39.191 --> 22:40.275
is just a matter of time.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.527
Maybe today's his lucky day.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.822
We got a place to look
for an associate of Justin's

22:45.906 --> 22:48.617
-could've been involved in this.
-We'll keep you posted.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.535
I'd be grateful.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.080
Young man, young man.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.959
Did it seem she'd suffered? Rita?

23:00.295 --> 23:01.546
It didn't. No.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.299
No. We both commented on that.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.325
He's got no idea we like him?

23:30.575 --> 23:34.454
Well, we told him it's SOP
us talking to him,

23:34.538 --> 23:37.457
him working dispatch
for the victimized delivery firm.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.293
Go at him off what Roberts gave us
on him gambling?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.045
Remember to hide Mike.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.880
Common knowledge in the office,
we'll tell him.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.883
Yeah, yeah.
His gambling jones is common knowledge.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.302
Maybe turn the screws
with that skell truck hijacker

23:49.386 --> 23:51.304
-Roberts mentioned.
-Ramon Moreno.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.975
Yeah. He's been seen consorting
with a known truck hijacker.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.393
Ramon Moreno.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.603
Well, he ain't gonna buy.
That's common knowledge.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.647
Well, is Ramon locked up?

24:02.566 --> 24:04.943
Ramon got grabbed up
the intervening period

24:05.026 --> 24:06.778
on some outstanding warrant.

24:06.862 --> 24:11.616
And obeyed his skell scumbag nature,
giving us Steve for inside guy

24:11.700 --> 24:13.034
on the delivery truck job.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.872
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.373
-Okay?
-DIANE: Mm-hmm.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.125
Unless you want him.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.252
We're still waiting
for the owner to get here.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.671
He's getting looked at
at his heart doctor's.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.383
Roberts should carry liability insurance
against cardiac arrests

24:28.467 --> 24:29.551
for all his clients.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.387
JAMES: You got any
money problems, Steve?

24:32.888 --> 24:33.930
No.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.058
I mean, everyone could use
more money, right?

24:37.976 --> 24:40.604
You've gotten involved recently
with fast women or the like?

24:41.021 --> 24:42.147
No.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.316
-GREG: Drugs?
-No.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.109
Gambling?

24:47.319 --> 24:50.614
I mean, I like to gamble a little...
recreationally.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.866
I like to go to the Meadowlands.

24:53.992 --> 24:54.993
OTB.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.120
But you're not having money problems.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.415
Everybody's got money problems, all right?

25:00.749 --> 25:01.791
What? Is that your point?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.211
Yeah, I got a few money problems.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.922
We're trying to give you a little basis
for an explanation, Steve.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.590
'Cause we got you involved in this.

25:09.257 --> 25:10.467
One of your co-conspirators

25:10.550 --> 25:12.928
gave you up for organizing
this truck hijack.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.888
-No way.
-BOTH: Oh, yeah.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.558
You think Ramon's gonna take it
on the chin himself?

25:20.644 --> 25:23.563
Steve, we know that a gambling problem

25:23.688 --> 25:26.775
can be every bit
as vicious as drugs or alcohol.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.402
A guy gets in a hole,
his debts are mounting,

25:29.694 --> 25:31.947
can't get no more credit
to win himself out.

25:32.155 --> 25:37.410
Now, did Ramon solicit you
to get involved in these truck hijacks?

25:41.623 --> 25:44.793
-Is Ramon really in custody?
-What kind of a question is that?

25:45.001 --> 25:47.546
I think, he think he communicated
by, uh, telepathy?

25:49.381 --> 25:53.843
'Cause I could give you something,
but that assumes Ramon is out.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.847
All right. Assume Ramon is out.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.891
For the sake of discussion,
assume he's out.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.601
So in other words, you were lying.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.936
JAMES: Well...

26:04.271 --> 26:06.856
Steve, the central question for you is,

26:07.357 --> 26:09.484
how am I, Steve Jung, gonna help myself?

26:10.068 --> 26:15.615
Yeah. If assuming Ramon's at liberty
gets you to that self-realization...

26:15.865 --> 26:17.367
-Go ahead and do so.
-Yeah.

26:23.498 --> 26:27.335
If I were to pinpoint another job
going off this afternoon...

26:30.005 --> 26:31.172
I'd want a walk.

26:31.756 --> 26:32.841
Going off this afternoon?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.927
This afternoon, yes, this afternoon.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.430
With Ramon that's not in custody.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.682
I don't know about an absolute walk,

26:41.224 --> 26:43.393
but within one of the next several
Breeders' Cups,

26:43.518 --> 26:46.438
I can certainly imagine you in attendance.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.580
(SCOFFS) Those breasts
are anatomically incorrect.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.084
They're like, uh,
growing out of her collarbone.

27:09.044 --> 27:12.547
-You ain't puttin' me back in Rikers.
-Does this look like Rikers, Jerry?

27:12.881 --> 27:14.924
It looks like me gettin'
picked up at a pool hall,

27:15.383 --> 27:18.011
hearing some wrong
form invalidated my release.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.889
A form got filled out incorrectly.
We're gonna rectify that.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.766
You don't gotta worry about it too much.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.560
Where were you yesterday afternoon, Jerry?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.272
-Out and about.
-Enjoying your newfound freedom?

27:29.648 --> 27:32.484
You happen by Justin Candell's building?

27:33.818 --> 27:35.862
You know, Justin Candell?

27:35.945 --> 27:39.032
The kid you're teaching
the latest buggery advances from prison.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.369
What's this invalidated form
needs to get straightened out?

27:42.452 --> 27:45.413
So that wasn't you
at Justin Candell's building yesterday?

27:45.497 --> 27:48.124
Having that conversation
with Mrs. Candell's neighbor

27:48.208 --> 27:50.585
about being a delivery guy,
which you're not?

27:51.670 --> 27:54.047
-Where's the form?
-There is no form, dimwit.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.258
This is what you gotta deal with.
This, what I'm talking about.

27:59.302 --> 28:02.722
-I was in the building. So what?
-Doing what?

28:04.808 --> 28:06.184
I bang a broad there.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.144
I gave a fake story to the neighbor,

28:08.311 --> 28:10.021
'cause I don't want her husband
getting tipped off.

28:10.146 --> 28:13.983
That's some nimble thinking there, Jerry.
Your brother Tom would be proud.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.485
You inventing that.

28:16.194 --> 28:19.489
-I ain't got no brother Tom.
-You see, you got character, Jerry.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.866
My brother discovered the light bulb,

28:21.991 --> 28:24.202
I'd be looking to cash
in on the family connection.

28:24.285 --> 28:27.205
But you, you're out here
trying to make it on your own as a thief.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.582
What's he talkin' about?

28:29.999 --> 28:32.293
Oh, my partner's making a little joke,
Jerry.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.714
based on you giving the name "Edison"
at the gold trader in Chinatown.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.425
Where you fenced
Mrs. Candell's stolen coins

28:38.508 --> 28:39.884
after you got done robbing her.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.928
And where they got your mug
on the surveillance camera

28:42.011 --> 28:43.138
doing the transaction.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.391
We got you at the scene,
we got you fencing the goods.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.935
Now, this was a simple robbery, Jerry.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.479
You want to annoy some judge
making him listen

28:51.563 --> 28:55.358
to a parade of witnesses pick you out
or admit you did wrong?

28:55.442 --> 28:57.986
You're very apologetic,
and maybe cut your time.

28:58.611 --> 28:59.696
I ain't doin' no time.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.824
It was a simple robbery
where no one got hurt.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.494
And I'm prepared to give you
the guy who set it up.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.913
Someone put you up to it?
That where you're goin'?

29:10.206 --> 29:11.750
I did this strictly for hire.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.543
I think that's gonna help you, Jerry.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.504
I was given a map where the items were,

29:17.338 --> 29:19.132
and I very gently handled that old woman.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.468
Whose being there
was not part of the deal.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.845
I made sure no harm come to her.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.598
Who gave you the map
to the old woman's place?

29:27.098 --> 29:28.808
This little faggot Justin.

29:29.726 --> 29:30.894
She's his mother.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.397
Justin didn't mention his mom being there?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.816
Said she'd be out playing bridge
with her friends.

29:37.817 --> 29:40.779
I still got the floor plans he drew up.
It's got his writing on it.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.823
Attaboy, Jerry.
Got yourself off the hot seat.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.204
Tell that old lady I was as gentle
as I could be, huh?

29:50.538 --> 29:52.999
I mean, uh, I'm glad she didn't get hurt.

29:54.751 --> 29:55.835
Yeah, good.

29:58.254 --> 29:59.798
That gag wasn't too tight, right?

30:02.342 --> 30:04.135
She told you how I readjusted it
for her, right?

30:12.185 --> 30:14.896
-This Steve is a home run.
-What's he got?

30:15.522 --> 30:17.941
The same crew's gonna stick up another one
of these delivery trucks.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.609
-DIANE: When?
-Hey, boss.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.029
-That dispatcher Mike Roberts gave us.
-Yeah. Steve Jung.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.949
He puts the same crew about to do another
job on Fourth.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.283
Pretty greedy.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.994
-Same way the other job went down?
-Yeah, exact same M.O.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.455
With Anti-Crime,
we'll have enough people to cover it.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.125
Um, have ESU set up
a staging area on Sixth.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.336
-Yeah, good.
-Mike Roberts.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.714
Even stopped clocks are right twice a day.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.962
Even if only in a peripheral way.
You know what I mean, Lieutenant?

32:03.171 --> 32:04.631
-You turned the case for us.
-No.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.300
Even if only peripherally,

32:07.842 --> 32:09.510
it's good to feel I helped.

Hey, they're on their way back,
Mr. DiNovi.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.103
The detectives are on their way back

32:19.270 --> 32:22.065
with the whole thievin',
miserable bunch of them in custody.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.358
Not Steve Jung.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.402
No. Jung, as I understand it,
was the inside man.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.904
He's already in custody.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.781
Jung that you got hired.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.575
In fairness, I think,
Jung that I did a background check on.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.286
Jung whose job ap you brought me.

32:37.163 --> 32:40.375
Happy occasion.
Do we want to be quibbling about this now?

32:40.750 --> 32:41.876
This your boss, Mike?

32:41.960 --> 32:45.797
Yeah. Frank DiNovi, Citiwide Courier,
Lieutenant Arthur Fancy.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.091
-How do you do?
-I want him questioned.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.760
-What!
-I want to know if he was part of this.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.261
Oh, this is amazing.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.682
Mike Roberts provided the information
that broke this case.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.101
Yeah. He also provided the guy
that set it up.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.769
I want to know if they're in cahoots.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.729
It so happens, Mr. DiNovi,

33:01.980 --> 33:05.316
Steve Jung was recommended
to his position by a relative.

33:05.566 --> 33:08.361
We never laid eyes on each other
until the day he started work.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.905
But you gave him
a thorough background check.

33:11.155 --> 33:14.742
Many reputable firms in my field
do not do hands-on interviews.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.121
What relative recommended him,
some broad you were bangin'?

33:19.580 --> 33:21.916
I'm not gonna dignify
that type of slander.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.668
Um, here come the detectives

33:23.918 --> 33:25.628
that caught the guys
that hijacked your truck.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.756
Was this guy ever really a cop?

33:37.265 --> 33:39.350
Yes, I was, you asshole!

33:48.735 --> 33:50.028
It's his part of Italy, you know.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.574
That's how they express gratitude,
you know,

33:54.699 --> 33:56.951
they try to impugn your integrity.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.372
That guy realize
the vital role Mike played?

34:01.622 --> 34:03.750
Yeah. I told him Mike's
who broke the case.

34:04.083 --> 34:08.880
Hey, worry not. I played Daffy Duck
in my high school play, you know?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.715
It's like water off my back.

34:15.553 --> 34:19.307
-I guess Andy's, uh, in on his case.
-Yeah. Doing an interview.

he's workin' with.

Hey, you, with the thunderin' right hand.

I don't have the vaguest idea
what you're talking about.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.388
Well, that puts you in a large club.

35:01.307 --> 35:02.767

You listenin'?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.146
I'm listening.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.109
You got nothin' to fear from me,
you understand?

35:12.360 --> 35:16.489
But that don't necessarily mean
that you got nothin' to fear.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.075
What should I be afraid of?

35:20.368 --> 35:22.745
Rich people got vanity.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.706
They carry a grievance,

35:26.290 --> 35:28.334
and they can afford their whims.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.004
They carry a grievance
over getting knocked down?

you got your heads-up.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.928
Give my regards to Barbra Streisand.

You want to find "half smart"
in the dictionary,

35:57.071 --> 35:58.990
look for this pisspot's mug.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.326
I didn't do it.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.995
Sets his own mother up to be murdered,

36:04.203 --> 36:06.080
and don't fathom
the importance of remorse.

36:06.539 --> 36:10.126
I... did... not... do... it.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.711
You didn't draw this?

36:12.962 --> 36:16.340
I was under duress.
I was being threatened by Jerry Edwards.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.386
Jerry was gonna force Justin
to have normal sex with a girl.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.098
I screwed three women
for everyone you have.

36:26.309 --> 36:29.770
-And I'm spotting you 30 years.
-What did you just say to my partner?

36:31.439 --> 36:33.691
All I'm saying is that when I'm high...

36:35.401 --> 36:36.777
I'm down for anything.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.450
Try to wrap your mind around that.

36:42.825 --> 36:46.037
Well, here's the impression you make
from an earthling's perspective, Justin.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.580
You get your mother murdered,

36:47.747 --> 36:49.916
and you're here stacking scores up
with my partner.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.002
How Justin's feeling
I don't need to build up a right attitude.

36:53.085 --> 36:57.173
I'm not totally ridiculous
with this half-assed alibi.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.052
No jury member's gonna
take my duress map defense

37:01.135 --> 37:02.929
for an insult to their intelligence.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.140
Yeah. Cock-and-bull story
like that's gonna offend no one.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.310
Make 'em want to authorize
Justin getting a hole punched in him

37:09.435 --> 37:12.647
someplace where it hasn't been before,
and getting some poison shot in.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.983
Yeah, 'cause none of them jury members
have mothers of their own.

You're not falling
into your k-hole, are you?

37:22.740 --> 37:24.909
What do you know about a k-hole, huh?

37:25.284 --> 37:29.330
What I've been told, it's an ugly place.
You get really depressed.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.957
You don't want to go down there.

37:32.875 --> 37:36.003
(SNIFFLES) I mean, I can't believe
that you're suggesting

37:36.087 --> 37:37.672
that I wanted my mother dead.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.215
He's in the k-hole.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.843
We're not suggesting nothin', Justin.
We're here like visual aids.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.179
So you can imagine
what a jury will be thinking

37:45.388 --> 37:47.223
watching you sitting there in your k-hole,

37:47.306 --> 37:51.811
shriveling up like a straw wrapper
in a campfire with your map defense.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.692
Are you aware that Tuesdays
are my mother's bridge days?

37:59.860 --> 38:02.530

a Tuesday bridge game in...

38:18.087 --> 38:20.506
But I'm gonna write what I want to write.

38:24.176 --> 38:26.929
It starts a long time ago,
between my mother and me.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.640
But in our galaxy, right?

38:46.365 --> 38:48.784
It came through in the statement
how she treated me?

38:48.993 --> 38:51.787
Yeah. You gave that real strong play,
your mother's shortcomings.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.583
-JUSTIN: She ruined my life.
-Who are you talking about, Justin?

38:56.834 --> 38:58.377
Are you talking about your mother?

It's Seymour Epstein, Justin.

39:05.468 --> 39:08.554
-Are you representing me?
-Did you kill your mother?

39:09.847 --> 39:12.725
I confessed to having
laid out the floor plan

39:12.975 --> 39:15.728
and believing that
she'd be out playing bridge.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.104
Period.

39:17.855 --> 39:21.525
You loathsome little son of a bitch.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.444
-What?
-My kind of lawyer.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.197
I'm not representing you.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.326
I wish to God you'd never been born.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.291
I want a different attorney.

from the A list.

down in holding?

39:44.340 --> 39:45.966
-They hook me up?
-Get him outta here.

What were you, Justin,
thinking your day took a lucky turn?

more complicated.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.210
I stood back.

40:22.461 --> 40:25.005
When Howie and I had crushes,
I stood back.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.842
When he proposed to her.

40:29.176 --> 40:30.928
When he died, I stood back.

40:32.054 --> 40:36.475
Waiting for her to appreciate
the years I'd waited.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.396
How honorable my waiting had been.
(SCOFFS)

40:42.314 --> 40:43.983
Howie, I take it, was her spouse.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.403
Don't stand back, young man.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.280
I understand.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.449
It's not enough to understand.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.493
I've understood things my whole life,

40:55.744 --> 40:58.080
and I've never lived a minute.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.089
And now my minute is over.

41:16.515 --> 41:18.350
Don't get him anyone good.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.187
Don't worry.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.615
(CLEARS THROAT)

41:40.789 --> 41:43.709
-So Roberts give you a live one.
-Yep.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.837
Was he in to collect his kudos?

41:47.004 --> 41:48.923
Got handed his ass instead.

41:50.174 --> 41:53.636
Guy from the truck courier service
dressed Mike down in front of us.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.555
'Cause Mike vouched for the dispatcher
set the hijacks up.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.391
He told me, he was bangin'
this guy's sister?

41:59.558 --> 42:01.519
Sounds like par for the course
for this guy.

42:01.810 --> 42:05.147
Oh, you're talking a classic screw-up,
Mike Roberts.

42:05.856 --> 42:09.026
He give any indication he was involved
with something else, Roberts?

42:09.318 --> 42:10.694
GREG: He didn't say anything.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.155
Hmm. He wanted to get involved with Jill.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.909
Yeah. Kind of a sorry-ass guy.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.037
Oh, he's... he's a classic sorry ass,
Mike Roberts.

42:21.747 --> 42:22.748
Good night.

42:22.873 --> 42:25.084
-ANDY: Yeah, good night.
-Strong in the streets today, partner.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.336
Yeah. We're a very imposing quartet.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.213
Good night, John.

42:30.631 --> 42:31.674
Good night.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.051
ANDY: Not that he was involved
with something else, though, Roberts?

42:34.426 --> 42:37.263
-Some type jackpot?
-Like against his conscience.

42:41.308 --> 42:45.271
Go against Mike's conscience,
it'd be organizing a nuclear attack.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.523
-(CHUCKLES) Something on that order.
-(CHUCKLES) Right.
