00:03.055 --> 00:05.956
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:37.723 --> 00:42.057
Zak failed Basic Flight. But
he didn't because I passed him.

00:43.162 --> 00:45.289
I can't decode it,
but it means there's someone.

00:45.364 --> 00:49.494
Someone in the military is still somewhere,
alive and kicking here in Caprica.

00:50.936 --> 00:52.369
I have cancer.

00:52.438 --> 00:56.204
And I fear that knowledge of
my illness will erode hope.

00:56.442 --> 00:59.206
So this has to stay
between you and me.

01:00.312 --> 01:03.611
Zak was my brother.
What was he to me, nothing?

01:04.383 --> 01:08.149
Same old Lee.
You haven't changed either.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.131
Helmet!

01:23.302 --> 01:25.736
You are so unprepared.
Shut up!

01:26.572 --> 01:29.700
You're the worst CAG in the
history of CAGs, actually.

01:32.711 --> 01:35.373
<i>Raptor pilot Lt. Dwight Flat Top Sanders...</i>

01:35.448 --> 01:38.713
<i>entering Hangar Deck 12 B.
Deck hands, please report.</i>

01:38.784 --> 01:41.446
<i>Repeat, deck hands,
please report to 12 B.</i>

01:41.587 --> 01:42.747
There he is!

01:42.822 --> 01:44.221
Way to go, Lieutenant!

01:44.290 --> 01:46.781
We're talking one thousand! Yeah.

01:48.427 --> 01:50.418
One thousand!

01:50.496 --> 01:54.227
1-0-0-0!

01:54.800 --> 01:57.200
Raptor pilots flying high!

01:57.269 --> 01:59.703
Raptor pilots flying high!

01:59.772 --> 02:01.967
Red paint, incoming.
Brush?

02:02.041 --> 02:03.303
Brush?
Brush.

02:04.143 --> 02:06.475
You're the worst.
The absolute worst!

02:06.545 --> 02:07.569
Here.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.771
Raptor pilots flying by!

02:09.849 --> 02:12.113
Raptor pilots flying high!

02:13.352 --> 02:14.944
What the hell is this?

02:15.020 --> 02:18.717
Flat Top's thousandth landing and
nobody tells me. Now we look like idiots.

02:18.791 --> 02:21.089
Find a wagon!
Yes, sir.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.855
Somebody get me a wagon!

02:24.130 --> 02:26.826
1-0-0...

02:27.233 --> 02:29.064
You're not ready yet?

02:33.139 --> 02:35.869
Someone's going to
have to pick that up.

02:37.176 --> 02:39.838
Stop it!
Let's go, come on.

02:41.747 --> 02:44.716
This one's perfect. Here,
take this. Give me a hand.

02:44.917 --> 02:47.215
Unload this. Put it wherever.

02:48.687 --> 02:50.484
You two, come here.

02:51.357 --> 02:53.518
Take this wagon to the pilots.

02:59.431 --> 03:02.457
So, did the Commander tell you what
happened on his thousandth landing?

03:02.535 --> 03:04.526
I don't remember telling you
about what I did.

03:04.603 --> 03:05.763
Yeah, whatever.

03:05.838 --> 03:07.305
<i>He's landing on
the Atlantia...</i>

03:07.373 --> 03:10.103
and he's been having this
ongoing fight with the LSO...

03:10.176 --> 03:12.371
and so he decides he's gonna
really stick it to him good.

03:12.444 --> 03:14.275
This has all been
over-exaggerated. So...

03:16.182 --> 03:18.480
Come on, people, watch them bake!

03:18.551 --> 03:20.610
Three little Cylons in the air!

03:20.686 --> 03:23.211
Three little Cylons in the air!

03:23.289 --> 03:25.280
Watch their metal burn and flare!

03:25.357 --> 03:26.619
Watch their metal...

03:26.692 --> 03:28.956
So, he skids to a stop
on the flight deck...

03:29.028 --> 03:33.226
and the LSO hears over the wireless
this big, loud, long, obnoxious...

03:36.869 --> 03:40.396
I was young. Oh, no. It was
great. It was really funny.

03:40.472 --> 03:42.667
Two little Cylons jump in the cave!

03:42.741 --> 03:44.709
Two little Cylons jump in the cave!

03:44.777 --> 03:47.245
Come on, ACARS,
make it their grave!

03:47.379 --> 03:48.403
The LSO
is freaking out...

03:48.480 --> 03:50.471
your dad doesn't care
because he hates the guy.

03:50.549 --> 03:53.780
He figures he can get away with it
anyway 'cause it's his thousandth landing.

03:53.852 --> 03:56.116
"I can get away
with anything today."

03:56.488 --> 03:58.547
Watch them run! Raptors pilots...

04:06.966 --> 04:09.161
Five little Cylons in the grass!

04:09.235 --> 04:11.829
Five little Cylons in the grass!

04:12.004 --> 04:13.995
Watch the Raptor light their ass!

04:14.073 --> 04:16.507
Watch the Raptor light their ass!

04:26.552 --> 04:27.576
Personally...

04:29.788 --> 04:32.188
<i>Attention! Fire in the port hangar deck.</i>

04:32.258 --> 04:33.816
<i>Away the fire and rescue team.</i>

04:33.892 --> 04:35.359
Let's go!

05:52.965 --> 05:56.298
Metal fatigue,
old equipment.

05:58.938 --> 06:02.738
Worn strap fails, drops a
million cubit drone to the deck.

06:03.609 --> 06:06.703
Kills 13 pilots and lands
seven more in sickbay.

06:11.684 --> 06:13.675
It's hard to hear this,
I know, but we got lucky.

06:13.752 --> 06:16.186
If that had been a missile
instead of a comm drone...

06:16.255 --> 06:18.780
would've taken out
the side of the ship.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.820
Never had a death
on my hangar deck.

06:23.262 --> 06:26.754
Accidents. Never a death.

06:33.572 --> 06:35.472
Services for the dead.

06:35.808 --> 06:40.541
Services will commence at 1100
hours on the forward hangar deck.

06:40.613 --> 06:43.309
Midship's hangar deck
remains closed...

06:43.515 --> 06:46.951
for investigation and clean-up
until further notice.

06:48.787 --> 06:51.915
Uniforms for the services
will be dress grays.

06:54.660 --> 06:58.391
I wish I knew what to say,
words to make this better.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.794
Can anything make this better?
I don't know.

07:06.705 --> 07:08.468
Attention on deck!

07:11.176 --> 07:12.643
As you were.

07:24.156 --> 07:26.351
May I?
Yes, sir.

07:38.537 --> 07:40.232
Are you Lt. Thrace?

07:46.946 --> 07:48.538
Give me your eyes.

07:51.917 --> 07:54.317
I know this has been
a hard day.

07:55.220 --> 07:57.780
There's been
plenty of them lately.

07:59.992 --> 08:03.086
I can guarantee you
there'll be more to come.

08:05.097 --> 08:08.430
Remember your self-esteem.
Your self-respect.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.096
And your self-worth.

08:11.904 --> 08:15.169
Hold strong to them,
because people are watching.

08:16.675 --> 08:19.269
You're the guardians
of the fleet.

08:21.013 --> 08:24.107
They need to know that
they can count on you.

08:25.284 --> 08:27.013
Even at a time like this.

08:34.026 --> 08:35.721
Are you Lt. Thrace?

08:38.464 --> 08:40.796
I'm Cdr. Adama. Zak's father.

08:42.001 --> 08:44.765
I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

08:44.837 --> 08:47.965
I was planning on coming to see
you tomorrow before the funeral.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.201
You don't need
to explain anything.

08:57.716 --> 08:59.183
Present arms!

09:05.257 --> 09:06.690
Order arms!

09:11.130 --> 09:14.395
Once again, we are charged
with the solemn duty...

09:15.034 --> 09:18.128
to return the bodies of
our own to the universe...

09:18.237 --> 09:21.297
from which the Lords of Kobol
brought them to us.

09:22.941 --> 09:26.638
The burdens of this life
are with us but a short time.

09:27.946 --> 09:32.645
For Lt. Zak Adama, son of
William and Caroline Adama...

09:33.085 --> 09:36.077
brother of Lee,
the time was too short.

09:36.155 --> 09:40.216
But we take comfort in knowing
his life was willingly given...

09:40.292 --> 09:42.453
in service to all of us.

09:43.429 --> 09:45.420
We honor them for that.

09:46.065 --> 09:50.798
And, thus, it falls upon us
to repent our sins...

09:51.336 --> 09:54.203
and with the help of
the Lords of Kobol...

09:54.306 --> 09:57.469
make our own lives
worthy of that gift.

09:59.144 --> 10:03.638
And now, we commit his body to the
ground from which we were all made.

10:05.150 --> 10:07.277
Secure in the knowledge...

10:07.753 --> 10:10.586
that we will be
reunited with them...

10:11.924 --> 10:14.119
in a better world to come.

10:57.236 --> 10:58.760
So say we all.

10:59.705 --> 11:01.434
So say we all.

11:11.350 --> 11:12.840
Present arms!

11:43.081 --> 11:44.912
Pilots we've known.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.320
I have to start training
new pilots.

11:58.230 --> 11:59.390
There it is.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.460
I kind of thought
this was about that.

12:06.071 --> 12:09.234
I don't know if
I'm the right person for this.

12:09.508 --> 12:11.738
Do you know someone better?
No.

12:11.810 --> 12:12.868
No.

12:12.945 --> 12:16.904
But there's almost
50,000 people out there.

12:17.182 --> 12:19.912
Trying to tell me there's
not one flight instructor?

12:19.985 --> 12:22.852
There's two.
Civilians. Both.

12:23.355 --> 12:26.324
But I need someone
to teach combat tactics.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.628
You know, I don't know
if I'd be of any use to you.

12:30.696 --> 12:33.529
I wasn't the most patient...
Let's get down to it.

12:34.499 --> 12:36.228
This is about Zak.

12:38.370 --> 12:40.270
It was not your fault.

12:41.607 --> 12:44.508
You had nothing
to do with what happened.

12:45.777 --> 12:47.608
It was an accident.

12:48.113 --> 12:51.879
Lee? Zak failed Basic Flight.

12:54.019 --> 12:57.546
What? Or at least he should
have, but he didn't...

12:58.023 --> 12:59.888
because I passed him.

13:00.892 --> 13:03.793
His technique was sloppy and
he had no feel for flying...

13:03.862 --> 13:05.693
but I passed him.

13:06.365 --> 13:08.128
Because he and I...

13:10.202 --> 13:14.138
Because I felt something and I let
it get in the way of doing my job.

13:14.239 --> 13:16.070
And I couldn't fail him.

13:21.980 --> 13:26.383
Zak passed Basic Flight.

13:27.519 --> 13:30.818
He was trained and ready
to sit in that cockpit.

13:32.658 --> 13:36.321
What happened to him could've
happened to any qualified pilot.

13:36.428 --> 13:40.023
You know that's true.
Right.

13:42.301 --> 13:46.601
You did your job to the best of
your ability. That's all I can ask.

13:49.608 --> 13:52.873
I need new pilots. And
I want you to train them.

13:58.650 --> 14:00.174
I can do that.

14:15.867 --> 14:19.701
Just give them the attention and the
professionalism that you gave my son.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.296
And they'll be
one hell of a squadron.

14:51.168 --> 14:53.659
Ten cubits says
she takes him this time.

15:00.777 --> 15:02.142
You're on.

15:29.206 --> 15:32.505
Thanks for the vote of
confidence. Ten to stay.

15:52.629 --> 15:57.191
So, Gaeta, how are you and the Doc
here doing on your Cylon detector?

15:57.901 --> 15:59.766
What Cylon detector?

16:00.470 --> 16:03.598
Rumor has it that Cylons looks like people...

16:03.974 --> 16:07.273
and you guys are working on
a way to weed them out, right?

16:09.279 --> 16:12.510
I want you to tell me
the truth about something.

16:15.986 --> 16:17.317
You passed.

16:18.522 --> 16:21.218
By the skin of your teeth,
but you passed.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.054
I don't want any special treatment.

16:23.126 --> 16:24.525
Not from my father...

16:24.594 --> 16:26.789
<i>and certainly not from you.</i>

16:26.863 --> 16:29.798
If there were such a program,
it would be classified...

16:29.866 --> 16:31.595
and I wouldn't be able
to talk about it.

16:31.668 --> 16:34.933
Something smells horrible in
here. Is that you, Crashdown?

16:35.205 --> 16:37.366
Yeah, that's me.
Your card.

16:39.209 --> 16:40.608
Your card.

16:41.378 --> 16:45.144
Zak,
I'm a flight instructor.

16:45.983 --> 16:50.682
I'm not going to send you to Vipers if
I don't think you've got the chops. Okay?

16:53.757 --> 16:55.816
Hello?
Are you all right?

16:57.861 --> 16:59.226
Look...

17:16.847 --> 17:18.940
Maybe you'd like
to take a break?

17:22.586 --> 17:23.951
I'm out of here.

17:25.355 --> 17:26.788
Starbuck?

17:29.993 --> 17:31.620
Okay, she can't do that.

17:31.695 --> 17:33.162
She can and she did.

17:52.949 --> 17:54.280
This is it.

17:59.222 --> 18:00.621
Restaurant.

18:02.626 --> 18:05.094
I'm almost on top of the signal.

18:06.663 --> 18:10.724
I don't get it. How does a military
coded signal end up coming from in here?

18:10.801 --> 18:11.825
Let's find out.

18:27.751 --> 18:30.049
Nothing.
Is that thing working?

18:32.722 --> 18:34.815
I checked it three times.

18:42.699 --> 18:45.327
This thing says
we're right on top of it.

18:47.504 --> 18:48.801
Of what?

19:00.016 --> 19:01.108
What?

19:10.727 --> 19:13.491
Helo.
You're fracking kidding me.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.141
Food. Medical supplies.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.988
Wait a minute, the signal.

19:50.634 --> 19:52.295
Disaster beacon.

19:52.769 --> 19:55.636
Must've been set to go off
if there was an attack.

19:56.173 --> 20:00.906
Some poor slob goes through all the trouble
of building a fallout shelter, stocks it...

20:01.878 --> 20:04.540
has a beacon, the whole plan.

20:06.483 --> 20:08.849
Then what?
What happens to him?

20:12.656 --> 20:15.625
Let's just call ourselves
lucky and leave it at that.

20:56.733 --> 21:00.464
Madam President. Would you
close that curtain, please?

21:05.909 --> 21:06.967
Thank you.

21:07.077 --> 21:11.605
You are obviously an intelligent,
well-educated young woman.

21:11.948 --> 21:15.076
Would you mind explaining to
me why you waited five years...

21:15.151 --> 21:16.812
in between breast exams?

21:16.920 --> 21:20.151
Yes, I would mind.
It's none of your business.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.180
I was busy.

21:24.327 --> 21:27.490
And now, here you are.
Yes. Here we are.

21:28.298 --> 21:31.631
Would you mind?
I do, actually.

21:32.702 --> 21:35.262
But your doctor
back on Caprica was right.

21:35.772 --> 21:38.434
It's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.

21:38.508 --> 21:42.000
All we can do now is try and shrink
the tumor with gamma treatments...

21:42.078 --> 21:44.410
and follow that up
with IV cis-Doloxan.

21:44.514 --> 21:48.507
Did he explain to you
the side effects of Doloxan?

21:48.752 --> 21:50.811
Hair loss, nausea,
muscle degeneration.

21:50.887 --> 21:54.550
I watched my mother endure two
years of Doloxan before she died.

21:55.592 --> 21:58.652
I would like to explore
alternate treatment.

21:59.529 --> 22:01.326
Prayer?
Witty.

22:02.365 --> 22:05.232
Have you ever heard
of Chamalla extract?

22:05.769 --> 22:09.899
Oh, gods. You're one of those.
What if it works?

22:12.842 --> 22:15.572
All the evidence on Chamalla
is anecdotal.

22:16.046 --> 22:18.981
It's nothing but a bunch of
loose talk and false hope.

22:19.049 --> 22:20.914
I'd take that as a yes.

22:24.154 --> 22:25.553
All right.

22:25.889 --> 22:29.154
I'll put out a med request
to the civilian fleet.

22:29.726 --> 22:32.991
Maybe there's some other
wide-eyed dreamer out there...

22:33.063 --> 22:36.226
with a secret horde of Chamalla
extract in their luggage.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.803
You can put your clothes
back on now. Thank you.

22:45.075 --> 22:47.168
And for what it's worth...

22:48.178 --> 22:52.740
I would seriously consider
prayer.

23:00.090 --> 23:02.524
Boonie jumpers.
Shuttle jockeys.

23:03.259 --> 23:07.127
And a Fleet Academy washout. This is
the best that you could come up with?

23:07.197 --> 23:09.722
Diamonds in the rough.
Yeah, right.

23:09.833 --> 23:12.461
They're the most qualified
pilots in the fleet.

23:12.535 --> 23:13.695
Great!

23:16.339 --> 23:17.966
Attention on deck.

23:21.144 --> 23:24.409
That means get on your feet,
nuggets!

23:28.685 --> 23:30.983
You are joining the Colonial
Fleet, boys and girls...

23:31.054 --> 23:33.352
not some after-school club.

23:33.423 --> 23:34.651
Seats.

23:40.463 --> 23:43.796
Pilots call me Starbuck,
you may refer to me as God.

23:44.267 --> 23:47.361
You've all flown before, but you're
about to enter a whole new world...

23:47.437 --> 23:48.927
so pay attention.

23:49.239 --> 23:51.366
We don't have any flight
simulators on board...

23:51.441 --> 23:54.569
so we're putting you
in the cockpit, today.

23:58.615 --> 24:00.480
<i>This is the Viper-Mark II.</i>

24:00.550 --> 24:03.917
It's as maneuverable as a jackrabbit,
and can flip end for end...

24:03.987 --> 24:05.852
in 0.35 seconds.

24:07.056 --> 24:10.583
You've never flown anything remotely
like it, so don't think that you have.

24:10.660 --> 24:14.096
Today we will be doing basic launch,
approach, and landing maneuvers.

24:14.164 --> 24:17.099
Anyone not paying attention
is liable to end up...

24:17.167 --> 24:21.900
as a puddle of something to be hosed out
of the cockpit by the chief of the deck.

24:24.140 --> 24:26.506
She's laying it on
a little thick.

24:27.143 --> 24:31.045
Costanza, right?
Yes, God, sir.

24:31.347 --> 24:34.612
Not anymore. From now
on, your name is Hot Dog.

24:34.684 --> 24:37.448
And when God speaks,
Hot Dog, you listen.

24:37.520 --> 24:41.547
Maybe if you had learned that at the
Academy, you wouldn't have washed out.

24:46.696 --> 24:48.027
Sit up!

24:54.604 --> 24:58.438
<i>Viper 791, Galactica,
you are cleared for approach.</i>

25:00.043 --> 25:03.535
<i>Speed 175, port bay,
hands-on approach...</i>

25:03.613 --> 25:05.808
<i>checkers green. Call the ball.</i>

25:09.185 --> 25:10.812
I have the ball.

25:11.521 --> 25:13.546
<i>Easy on the throttle, Kat.</i>

25:14.424 --> 25:18.053
<i>Are you listening to me?
Don't chase the lights, okay?</i>

25:19.028 --> 25:21.724
<i>Roger, Starbuck. Kat,
don't chase the lights!</i>

25:21.798 --> 25:24.232
Set it by the numbers
and correct with thrusters.

25:29.806 --> 25:31.103
<i>Wave-off!</i>

25:33.476 --> 25:34.704
Punch it, Kat!

25:42.519 --> 25:46.979
Worse than awful. Wretched
beyond belief, actually.

25:48.057 --> 25:49.820
You call yourselves pilots?

25:50.593 --> 25:52.288
It'll take
the knuckle draggers a week...

25:52.362 --> 25:54.330
to pound your divots
out of the flight deck.

25:54.397 --> 25:56.797
With due respect, sir,
that's unfair.

25:56.866 --> 25:59.198
Yes, sir.
This was only our first day.

26:01.571 --> 26:03.664
No. It's your last.

26:04.307 --> 26:07.538
It would be criminal to let
any of you near a Viper again.

26:07.644 --> 26:10.977
So pack your gear and get the
hell off my ship. You're done.

26:29.499 --> 26:31.399
What are you doing here,
Kara?

26:31.501 --> 26:34.732
You can't wash them out on
their first day. I just did.

26:36.706 --> 26:40.301
Look, I got 40 Vipers,
and 21 pilots. That's it.

26:41.044 --> 26:43.410
We are sitting ducks
until we finish water-ops.

26:43.479 --> 26:47.711
We can't even maintain a CAP. And
gods forbid the Cylons show up.

26:48.551 --> 26:51.714
Gods forbid. Let's bring in
the next group of candidates.

26:52.522 --> 26:55.753
The next group has never
even been in a cockpit.

26:56.559 --> 27:00.222
They're starting Basic Flight.
Then they start Basic Flight.

27:00.330 --> 27:02.924
Because that group is done.
It says so right there.

27:02.999 --> 27:04.990
Maybe you should
read it again.

27:06.035 --> 27:10.199
Lt. Thrace, this is not a
request. Well, Capt. Adama...

27:10.440 --> 27:14.274
I am the flight instructor,
sir. My word is scripture, sir.

27:14.577 --> 27:18.536
I will not, repeat, not pass
another student who isn't ready.

27:19.949 --> 27:21.883
So, that's what this is about.

27:22.218 --> 27:25.415
It's not them. It's Zak.

27:29.626 --> 27:31.150
Careful.

27:32.362 --> 27:34.262
Step back.

28:08.864 --> 28:11.856
Starbuck says they can't
cut it, they can't cut it.

28:11.933 --> 28:14.299
She's not giving them
a chance. It's Day 1.

28:14.369 --> 28:17.463
She's one of the finest pilots
I've ever seen in my life.

28:17.539 --> 28:19.404
If one day in the cockpit
is all she needs...

28:19.474 --> 28:21.339
to know if they're gonna
hack it or not...

28:21.409 --> 28:23.934
she got that.
I'm not arguing that, sir.

28:24.746 --> 28:29.046
I'm just saying I think she's letting
her personal feelings cloud her judgment.

28:29.117 --> 28:31.210
Please sit down, Captain.

28:34.189 --> 28:36.157
What are those feelings?

28:39.628 --> 28:40.959
About Zak.

28:42.497 --> 28:45.432
We've talked about Zak.
You did?

28:45.567 --> 28:47.728
We've talked about
a lot of things.

28:47.802 --> 28:51.966
We've been aboard this ship for over
two years. We know each other very well.

28:52.674 --> 28:54.938
When I asked her
to be the instructor...

28:55.010 --> 28:58.605
I knew it was going to release
a lot of loose baggage.

28:59.180 --> 29:03.674
She acknowledged it. She's a
professional. She'll do her job.

29:07.889 --> 29:08.947
Okay.

29:11.192 --> 29:14.889
I'm just saying that
you should talk to her.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.428
She's walking around
with a lot of emotion.

29:17.499 --> 29:20.093
She almost decked me
in the rec room.

29:21.670 --> 29:25.162
Right. You wouldn't smile
if you were there.

29:26.074 --> 29:28.235
I'll talk to her.
Thank you.

29:31.379 --> 29:32.903
Personally...

29:33.381 --> 29:37.283
I think she's trying to work out
her guilt over what she did for Zak.

29:37.385 --> 29:40.821
I think she's trying to make up
for it by beating up on these guys.

29:40.889 --> 29:43.585
Guilt? Over what?

29:44.359 --> 29:46.293
What did she do for Zak?

29:48.596 --> 29:51.622
I thought you just said...
What did she do?

29:56.738 --> 30:00.799
It's not my place to say and I've
already said more than I should have.

30:01.643 --> 30:05.101
You'll have to ask her.
I'm sorry. Captain, just...

30:05.180 --> 30:07.341
Dad, you'll have to ask her.

30:10.618 --> 30:12.313
<i>I don't want any special treatment.</i>

30:12.387 --> 30:13.820
<i>Not from my father...</i>

30:13.888 --> 30:15.719
<i>and certainly not from you.</i>

30:28.436 --> 30:30.028
You passed.

30:30.305 --> 30:33.035
By the skin of your teeth,
but you passed.

30:33.475 --> 30:34.464
Zak.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.777
<i>Attention.
Pass the word to Lt. Thrace.</i>

30:37.846 --> 30:40.542
<i>Lt. Thrace, please report to
the CO's quarters.</i>

30:53.595 --> 30:55.085
Yes. Come in.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.431
Lee was just here before.
I knew it.

31:04.439 --> 31:07.033
He thinks
you washed out...

31:07.675 --> 31:10.166
the nuggets
without giving them a chance.

31:11.112 --> 31:13.444
They didn't cut it. That's it.

31:17.685 --> 31:22.418
He thought you were letting personal
feelings cloud your judgment.

31:25.493 --> 31:28.155
Really?
Your feelings about Zak.

31:29.664 --> 31:31.495
That's not the case.

31:34.736 --> 31:35.760
Okay.

31:38.239 --> 31:40.298
He said something else.

31:42.110 --> 31:46.069
He said something that I
would like to ask you directly.

31:50.952 --> 31:54.217
He said that you might
have been feeling guilty...

31:54.289 --> 31:55.916
about something
that you did for Zak.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.150
What did you do for him?

31:59.994 --> 32:03.555
I don't know. You'd have
to ask Lee. I'm asking you.

32:04.299 --> 32:05.789
I don't...

32:06.734 --> 32:08.998
I don't really know what
he was talking about, so...

32:09.070 --> 32:11.197
Don't fence with me, Kara.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.339
I love you like a daughter.
I don't deserve that.

32:27.722 --> 32:32.182
Zak failed Basic Flight.

32:37.198 --> 32:40.497
He wasn't a bad pilot. He
just had no feel for flying.

32:47.709 --> 32:51.975
And when it came to his
final check-ride, he busted...

32:53.214 --> 32:55.444
three of the test maneuvers.

32:56.117 --> 32:58.813
And I should have flunked him,
but I didn't.

33:03.658 --> 33:06.650
The bottom line is
that your son...

33:08.763 --> 33:11.561
didn't have the chops
to fly a Viper.

33:14.335 --> 33:16.098
And it killed him.

33:20.775 --> 33:24.074
He told me that you
were an amazing instructor.

33:25.980 --> 33:29.780
And that he was involved with
you, and that it was serious.

33:30.218 --> 33:34.052
He'd asked me to come to his
graduation at flight school...

33:34.656 --> 33:38.558
and watch him get his wings.
I know. I read the letter.

33:39.861 --> 33:41.158
I see.

33:42.964 --> 33:46.024
Then, maybe you can tell me
what he was hinting at.

33:46.401 --> 33:48.335
The surprise, about you.

33:51.639 --> 33:53.539
We were going to...

33:56.010 --> 33:58.103
You know what,
it's not important.

33:58.179 --> 34:01.342
I don't want that to...
You were engaged, right?

34:08.523 --> 34:10.923
You did it
because you were engaged.

34:25.273 --> 34:27.400
Because I made a mistake.

34:29.544 --> 34:31.273
And because I was just...

34:32.547 --> 34:34.708
I was so in love with him.

34:37.552 --> 34:40.612
And I let that get in the way
of doing my job.

34:47.428 --> 34:52.127
He just wanted it so much and I didn't
want to be the one who crushed him.

35:00.108 --> 35:03.635
Reinstate the trainees
to flight status.

35:04.679 --> 35:05.941
I will.

35:06.981 --> 35:11.077
But I just want you to
understand that I... Do your job.

35:15.456 --> 35:16.684
Yes, sir.

35:17.325 --> 35:20.488
And walk out of this cabin
while you still can.

36:08.307 --> 36:11.970
Unpack your gear. You are
all returned to flight status.

36:13.746 --> 36:15.236
We're going to try this again.

36:15.314 --> 36:19.250
<i>Those of you who can be trained to
safely fly the Viper Mark II will pass.</i>

36:19.318 --> 36:21.843
Those of you who cannot,
will be cut.

36:22.254 --> 36:26.520
It is my job to figure out which is
which, without personal feeling either way.

36:28.928 --> 36:31.089
And I'm going to do my job.

36:33.666 --> 36:36.692
Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog,
you're up first.

36:38.838 --> 36:41.272
Pre-flight briefing
in 20 minutes.

36:51.717 --> 36:53.947
<i>Where the hell are you going,
Hot Dog? Stay on me.</i>

36:54.019 --> 36:56.647
<i>Target acquired and destroyed.</i>

36:57.890 --> 37:01.223
<i>Not bad, Hot Dog, but you
left your leader behind.</i>

37:01.327 --> 37:04.125
<i>Looks like you're having a bad day,
Hot Dog.</i>

37:05.765 --> 37:09.394
<i>And the moral of this story
is? Never leave your leader.</i>

37:10.836 --> 37:13.031
<i>Thank you. That is correct.</i>

37:13.839 --> 37:16.034
<i>You never want to be
out here alone.</i>

37:17.710 --> 37:20.975
<i>Okay, Chuckles, take Kat's wing.
Hot Dog, you're on me.</i>

37:21.046 --> 37:23.378
<i>We're gonna try a little
maneuver called "Thorch Weave."</i>

37:23.449 --> 37:26.111
I'll be damned.
What's got into Starbuck?

37:26.886 --> 37:30.049
She actually sounds like a
real instructor for a change.

37:32.224 --> 37:36.388
She may actually make Viper pilots
out of some of those nuggets after all.

37:44.770 --> 37:47.102
<i>Holy crap, we've got incoming.</i>

37:48.941 --> 37:51.341
Where the hell did they come from?

37:53.946 --> 37:56.005
Dradis. Multiple contacts.

37:59.518 --> 38:00.542
It's the Cylons.

38:00.619 --> 38:02.280
Why didn't we see them coming?

38:02.354 --> 38:04.254
Launch the alert fighters.

38:05.391 --> 38:08.554
<i>Attention! Set Condition 1
throughout the fleet.</i>

38:08.627 --> 38:10.993
<i>Galactica, we're gonna
need you to send the cavalry.</i>

38:11.063 --> 38:12.963
<i>Nuggets, punch it for home.</i>

38:21.106 --> 38:22.403
Where's the base ship?

38:22.475 --> 38:24.443
No base ships detected, sir.

38:24.510 --> 38:29.470
Eight raiders, bearing 047
carom 118. Range 22,000.

38:29.582 --> 38:32.176
They found us.
It was only a matter of time.

38:34.487 --> 38:37.923
<i>Galactica, Starbuck. Where the
hell are the alert fighters?</i>

38:45.865 --> 38:48.698
<i>Starbuck, Alert One.
Be there in two minutes.</i>

38:50.870 --> 38:52.531
The Cylons are gaining!

38:52.972 --> 38:54.803
<i>All right, listen up, nuggets.</i>

38:54.874 --> 38:59.538
<i>Stay together and keep your throttles
firewalled until you hit that deck.</i>

39:00.412 --> 39:01.640
<i>Now go.</i>

39:11.357 --> 39:12.654
What's she doing?

39:12.725 --> 39:15.125
Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.

39:18.130 --> 39:19.722
And get herself killed.

39:27.439 --> 39:29.737
<i>Hot Dog, where are you going?</i>

39:39.685 --> 39:41.812
<i>Hot Dog, what are you doing?</i>

39:44.690 --> 39:45.748
<i>Got one!</i>

39:45.824 --> 39:47.815
<i>Hot Dog, get out of here!</i>

39:49.295 --> 39:51.559
<i>Hot Dog, I thought I
told you to get your ass home!</i>

39:51.630 --> 39:53.222
<i>You said never to leave your leader.</i>

39:53.299 --> 39:55.665
<i>And I also said
never disobey an order.</i>

39:58.470 --> 40:00.199
<i>I'm hit!
I got you, Hot Dog!</i>

40:00.272 --> 40:03.298
<i>We're going to make it
through this. Break right. Now!</i>

40:18.824 --> 40:20.121
She'll make it.

40:24.229 --> 40:26.754
<i>I just lost all three mains.</i>

40:27.132 --> 40:29.191
<i>It's all right, Hot Dog.
You did good.</i>

40:29.268 --> 40:31.668
<i>We're gonna be okay,
I promise you.</i>

40:38.377 --> 40:40.402
<i>At least one of us will.</i>

40:40.746 --> 40:43.874
<i>That about does it.
I think there's only one left.</i>

40:49.521 --> 40:50.545
<i>Frack!</i>

40:53.692 --> 40:56.525
<i>He's right on my tail,
but I got it covered.</i>

41:00.733 --> 41:03.531
Starbuck's wireless
and transponder just cut out.

41:04.036 --> 41:08.029
<i>Alert One, we spotted Hot Dog.
No ID or visual on Starbuck.</i>

41:30.796 --> 41:32.058
<i>Frack me!</i>
