00:38.330 --> 00:40.424
Breakfast race!
Breakfast race!

00:54.680 --> 00:55.897
I win!

00:55.889 --> 00:58.563
No fair!
Interference from the wife!

01:01.895 --> 01:03.147
Dale, for the last time,

01:03.146 --> 01:05.319
you cannot store your poisons
in the fridge.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.817
We keep our food in here.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.411
Come on! I labeled
it this time.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.156
Hello?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.327
Nancy, Tom Chick here.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.916
We just got a hot tip
about a breaking story.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.875
I want you to cover it.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.832
I'm on it, Tom.
Give me the details.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.497
A student at Durndle Elementary

01:19.496 --> 01:21.089
brought his pet possum
to school.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.300
And?

01:23.292 --> 01:24.919
What? Did it bite somebody?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.886
No. It's a baby, and it's cute.
Go film it.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.882
Sure thing, Tom.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.885
Dang it, I'm sick of doing
these stupid animal stories.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.103
But that's the cutest part
of the news.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.722
Well, I'm tired of cute.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.599
Cute doesn't win you
a local Emmy.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.476
I'm bigger than possums, sugs.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.569
But this could be big.

01:42.561 --> 01:46.111
Come on, you're a genius at
making something from nothing.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.449
You made Joseph.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.279
You're right.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.873
If I'm gonna get ahead,
I have to do it myself.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.754
I didn't know you were allowed
to say that word on TV,

02:00.746 --> 02:03.124
let alone advertise a product
for it.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.591
Welcome back.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.051
We've all heard
of playing possum,

02:06.043 --> 02:09.092
but what about playing
<i>with</i> a possum?

02:09.086 --> 02:10.884
Nancy Hicks-Gribble reports.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.804
I'm here at Durndle Elementary

02:12.799 --> 02:14.767
with Billy Cook and
his little friend.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.137
What's your pet's name, Billy?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.683
Oranges!

02:17.679 --> 02:20.808
And how did you sneak
Oranges past school security?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.434
What's security?

02:22.434 --> 02:23.811
Exactly.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.904
A question far too
many schools are asking.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.275
Billy and Oranges stand here
as a chilling reminder

02:29.274 --> 02:31.697
of the tragedy that could've
befallen this school today.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.661
If this boy had been
an intruder,

02:33.654 --> 02:35.076
and this marsupial a gun,

02:35.072 --> 02:37.200
"Show and Tell" could've had
a much different

02:37.199 --> 02:38.917
and deadlier outcome.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.331
I'm Nancy Hicks-Gribble

02:40.327 --> 02:43.922
reporting on this dark day
in Durndle.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.086
That poor school.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.585
What?!
That wasn't even a story.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.961
It was just a bunch of it's.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.635
Hank, what could have happened
is often more important

02:52.631 --> 02:54.599
than what actually happened.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.888
This is terrible.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.852
If someone could bring a possum
to that school,

02:58.011 --> 03:00.855
what's stopping them
from bringing one to mine?!

03:04.893 --> 03:08.272
That classroom intruder
story has me all on edge.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.898
I miss the days

03:09.898 --> 03:12.526
when all I had to worry
about was getting pantsed.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.655
Yeah, school's supposed
to be my time to relax,

03:15.654 --> 03:17.531
but I'm so tense!

03:17.531 --> 03:18.828
Okay, people,

03:18.990 --> 03:20.287
eyes front!

03:20.283 --> 03:22.285
We're not getting caught
with our trousers down

03:22.285 --> 03:23.912
like those poor saps in Durndle.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.210
If any crazies try
to get into this school,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.584
you're gonna know
how to fight back.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.176
But what can we do?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.886
We're just kids.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.222
What...? You knuckleheads
are loaded for bear,

03:34.214 --> 03:35.887
and you don't even know it.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.761
The contents
of an average knapsack contains

03:38.760 --> 03:41.889
at least 13 ways
to disable a man.

03:41.888 --> 03:45.643
You see a pencil, I see a spear.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.646
A squirt of juice box can blind
your assailant.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.897
Cool!
Awesome!

03:49.896 --> 03:52.615
But the textbook can cause
the most damage

03:52.607 --> 03:54.234
from the greatest distance,

03:54.234 --> 03:57.488
like a boomerang
or the Cherokee throwing hammer.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.707
Now, let's see what you've got.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.873
Ooh! Nice shot!

04:03.869 --> 04:05.166
Ow! Ooh. Well done!

04:05.162 --> 04:06.539
Well... Oh, gah.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.506
Keep it up!

04:09.791 --> 04:10.917
Yup.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.595
Mm-hmm.

04:15.464 --> 04:16.807
Sugs!

04:16.964 --> 04:18.887
You are not gonna believe this!

04:18.884 --> 04:20.886
My possum story is so popular,

04:20.886 --> 04:23.810
it got picked up
by 12 affiliates!

04:23.972 --> 04:25.440
Wingo!
Congratulations!

04:25.432 --> 04:26.775
All right.
Huh.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.814
This is so exciting.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.274
Course, I don't know
what an affiliate is,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.147
but I'm just happy you're happy.

04:32.147 --> 04:36.903
It means my wife's face is
gonna be broadcast across Texas.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.826
Nancy, your prison fan mail
is about to quadruple!

04:39.988 --> 04:41.365
Ooh, you're right.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.911
But this isn't about the glory.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.286
I'm just happy
to be making the world safer

04:45.285 --> 04:48.129
in as many markets as I can.

04:48.121 --> 04:52.046
Am I the only one who realizes
that this story isn't news?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.464
How can you say that

04:53.460 --> 04:55.007
after what happened in Durndle?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.880
Nothing happened in Durndle!

04:56.880 --> 04:58.223
Oh, thank God.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.094
Direct hit, Joseph!

05:02.093 --> 05:04.437
What the heck
are you kids doing?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.523
Practicing our book aim, dude.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.564
Mrs. Gribble's story freaked
everybody out at school,

05:09.559 --> 05:12.654
so Coach Kleehammer
said us maggots need

05:12.646 --> 05:14.774
to know how to
protect ourselves.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.821
He says in this time
of uncertainty,

05:16.983 --> 05:20.908
we have to be vigilant
and ready to throw things.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.908
But today is no more uncertain
than yesterday

05:23.907 --> 05:25.705
because nothing happened.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.668
Thank God.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.086
Hello?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.425
Nancy Hicks-Gribble?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.838
Hi. This is
Bret Winslow,

05:34.835 --> 05:37.054
general manager of
KUMT in Dallas.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.547
The News Mountain?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.890
That's right.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.883
Listen, I caught your
classroom intruder piece,

05:41.883 --> 05:43.885
and was very impressed.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.729
So impressed that I'd
like to offer you a job.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.098
Oh, my God!

05:48.098 --> 05:49.896
I mean, I knew it was good,

05:49.891 --> 05:51.859
but I didn't know
it was Dallas good.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.645
This is incredible! I...

05:54.896 --> 05:57.069
I don't know
if we can leave Arlen.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.863
My son is in school here,

05:59.025 --> 06:01.448
my husband
has a job... kind of.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.912
Are you crazy?
Say yes!

06:02.904 --> 06:04.872
Dale, what are you doing
on the phone?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.125
I monitor all incoming calls.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.835
Nancy, you said
you wanted something bigger,

06:08.994 --> 06:10.371
and this is huge!

06:10.370 --> 06:11.713
You go, we'll make it work.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.423
Yeah. Do it, Mom!

06:13.415 --> 06:16.168
That's my boy,
monitoring the monitor.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.842
So, what do you say, Nancy?

06:19.838 --> 06:20.885
I'll take it!

06:20.881 --> 06:22.349
Yay!

06:22.340 --> 06:24.889
Let's meet
in the kitchen for a hug!

06:27.679 --> 06:29.477
Uh, I locked myself
in the basement.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.440
Be right there.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.617
Dale, are you sure you'll be
okay with Nancy away in Dallas?

06:40.609 --> 06:41.906
If you need
a home-cooked meal,

06:41.902 --> 06:43.779
we can go over
to Hank and Peggy's.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.904
Are you kidding?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.248
This is gonna be great.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.913
I can finally do all the
things Nancy won't let me do.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.877
You know, Dale, just
'cause Nancy isn't around,

06:51.036 --> 06:53.710
doesn't mean you can do
whatever you want.

06:53.705 --> 06:57.755
Uh, actually, that's exactly
what it means, Hank.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.801
I can't believe
this is happening!

07:01.796 --> 07:03.343
Me, a reporter in Dallas!

07:03.340 --> 07:04.762
I've wanted this ever since

07:04.758 --> 07:06.852
I stepped in front
of a green screen.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.561
Oh, I'm so nervous.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.726
What if I can't make it
in the Metroplex?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.565
Oh, of course you can, Nancy.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.809
You're ruthless.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.902
Remember when you paid
that kid with impetigo

07:15.894 --> 07:17.862
to hang out with your
homecoming queen competition?

07:18.021 --> 07:19.443
Yeah.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.908
You look sweet, but you'd
go for the windpipe

07:21.900 --> 07:23.152
first chance you get.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.654
Oh, thank you, sugs.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.783
Well, the car is packed
and ready to go.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.661
Uh, Nancy, are you sure
about this?

07:31.660 --> 07:35.085
You know, leaving Dale alone,
uh, with your son

07:35.080 --> 07:38.505
and your house,
which you still owe money on?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.047
This is my chance, Hank.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.920
Besides, Dale will be fine.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.046
He can survive anything.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.094
He's like one
of his cockroaches.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.809
Mom, has your luggage been
out of your possession

07:47.801 --> 07:48.893
since you packed it?

07:48.885 --> 07:51.104
Yeah.
Security breach.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.144
Joseph, sniff the bags.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.816
All right, ready, camera one?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.284
I need a single on Nancy.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.652
Prep the graphic.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.871
And... go, camera one.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.411
Councilman Schneider could not
be reached for comment.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.409
Wade and Gwen, back to you.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.332
Well, thanks for
that report, Nancy.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.295
And that's the news for tonight.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.914
I'm Gwen St. James.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.507
And I'm Wade Bixby.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.842
Good night and remember,

08:20.834 --> 08:24.555
we move mountains
to bring you the news.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.889
And we're out.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.882
Nice job, Nancy.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.225
You looked good out there.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.219
Thanks. It felt good.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.688
So, Nancy, every night,
we gather in my office

08:33.679 --> 08:35.774
for a little, uh,
post-show analysis,

08:35.765 --> 08:37.607
aka "Happy Hour."

08:39.019 --> 08:42.899
That's us-- think tank by day,
drunk tank by night.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.864
Just be careful.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.618
After a couple a drinks,
Wade gets a little grabby.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.826
I do.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.913
Well, I guess I don't have
to rush home

08:49.904 --> 08:52.077
to my family
like I usually do after work.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.201
You know, a drink sounds nice.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.544
Vodka, this is Chopper One.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.914
Traffic is clear from
my mouth to my stomach.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.915
Whoo!

09:00.915 --> 09:03.043
Give me the keys, Nancy.

09:03.043 --> 09:07.890
I want to buzz my ex-husband's
girlfriend's condo.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.636
I'm... Wade...

09:12.635 --> 09:14.603
Bixby!

09:16.723 --> 09:18.600
Have you guys seen Dale lately?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.898
It makes me nervous
when I can't see him.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.896
Nope.
And with Nancy being away,

09:22.896 --> 09:24.819
I figured we'd hang out
all the time.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.904
A couple of bachelors,
out on the town,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.902
up to no good.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.654
But things are the same.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.915
Hey, fellas, check it out!

09:41.915 --> 09:44.213
Only four more A/C units to go,

09:44.209 --> 09:46.928
and my transformation
to igloo status

09:46.920 --> 09:47.967
will be complete.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.555
Dale, you giblet-head.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.140
What are you doing
to your house?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.884
Reclimatization, Hank.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.888
At the rate this world is
cranking out carbon dioxide,

09:55.887 --> 09:57.889
we're just begging
for another Ice Age.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.393
If I prepare my body
for sub-zero temperatures now,

10:01.392 --> 10:03.736
I'll be able to enjoy
the glaciers

10:03.728 --> 10:05.401
rather than be killed by them.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.899
Wow, you're really
on top of things.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.446
Dale, this is crazy.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.319
Does Nancy know what
you're doing here?

10:11.319 --> 10:13.117
Maybe you like to bore Peggy

10:13.113 --> 10:14.865
with all your little projects,

10:14.864 --> 10:17.458
but I'm not going to bore
my wife with mine.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.918
Hey, Gribble, where should I put

10:18.910 --> 10:20.253
the walrus before it wakes up?

10:20.245 --> 10:21.872
Joseph's bed.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.473
I hate basketball,
but I love these martinis.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.263
Yes, being a Dallas celebrity
does have its perks.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.136
Course, some of us
spend a fortune

10:36.136 --> 10:38.480
keeping this
"lifestyle" off our face.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.723
Isn't that right, Gwennie?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.443
Finally, more shrimp.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.905
I hate that man.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.443
Really? I always thought

10:48.439 --> 10:50.112
you and Wade were
having an affair.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.327
We are.
It's good for ratings.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.286
Want to know how evil he is?

10:54.279 --> 10:55.496
Absolutely.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.536
Every year, the station
sponsors a float

10:57.532 --> 10:59.205
for the Rodeo Days parade.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.202
Wade, of course,
gets one of the seats,

11:01.202 --> 11:03.375
and he gets to pick
who sits next to him.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.921
And every year, instead of me,
he picks his dog.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.418
Oh, sug.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.386
You just made me hate Wade, too.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.881
You know, I think it's time
for some new blood

11:12.881 --> 11:14.178
on top of that float.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.142
And behind the anchor desk.

11:16.134 --> 11:19.809
Hmm, couple of Texas
beauties, perhaps?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.101
I like you, Nancy.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.895
You're going to go far here.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.168
What the heck is Dale
doing over there?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.833
Stop worrying about Dale
for two seconds

11:43.995 --> 11:45.918
and tell me what
you think of this one.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.292
Oh, I don't know, it's a dress.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.838
Just like the last one.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.428
Hank, Nancy was nice enough
to invite

11:52.420 --> 11:54.593
Minh and me to a fancy
Dallas party.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.887
The least I can do is look good.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.885
But not too good,
so Minh doesn't feel bad.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.728
Well, make sure you tell Nancy

12:00.720 --> 12:02.438
that her jackass husband

12:02.430 --> 12:05.434
is one air conditioner away
from an electrical fire.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.687
I knew her leaving
him alone was a bad idea.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.812
Vigilance!

12:10.897 --> 12:13.446
Robert Jeffrey Hill,
have you lost your mind?!

12:13.441 --> 12:14.818
Always check under the bed.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.907
That's Home Safety 101.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.905
Out.
Okay.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.624
But tomorrow,
we work on closets.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.291
I respect Wade,
but I worry about him.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.918
A man his age,
sneaking off to Mexico.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.170
Bringing back experimental

12:33.169 --> 12:34.887
black market pharmaceuticals.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.883
I know he is a local
broadcasting legend,

12:37.882 --> 12:39.634
but maybe it would be best...

12:39.634 --> 12:40.886
You know, for the station.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.728
...if Nancy
and I represented

12:42.720 --> 12:45.564
KUMT on the Rodeo Days float.

12:45.556 --> 12:49.311
Hmm, well, I am getting a little
tired of that beagle of his.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.068
I'll give it some thought.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.533
Nice work, partner.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.903
I thought I had game,
but I am impressed.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.784
Excuse me, Gwen,
my friends have arrived.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.910
Hey, sugs!

13:05.910 --> 13:08.379
Welcome to the
fabulous life, girls!

13:08.371 --> 13:11.215
Now, don't be intimidated by
all these beautiful people.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.551
Inside, we're all
the same as you.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.638
Yeah, well, thanks
for inviting us, Nancy.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.473
And we bring
greetings from Arlen.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.809
Everyone except Kahn says hello.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.553
Oh, how is everyone?

13:23.553 --> 13:24.850
Are they watching me on TV?

13:25.013 --> 13:26.481
It must be exciting for them

13:26.472 --> 13:28.315
to see somebody they know
get so famous.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.685
Yeah, real treat.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.903
Ooh, see that lady?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.487
The one with the
fake everything?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.856
We've been secret plotting

13:35.023 --> 13:37.117
to get Wade Bixby fired.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.610
But what she doesn't
know is that

13:38.609 --> 13:40.202
I'm secret double-crossing her

13:40.194 --> 13:42.367
to get her fired, too.
High-five!

13:42.363 --> 13:43.910
Nancy, that's awful.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.409
Well, I have to get ahead, sug.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.127
Enjoy your drinks, ladies.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.871
I have some rumors to spread.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.916
What the hell was that?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.462
I, I do not know.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.678
I've seen Nancy
with her claws out before,

13:56.669 --> 13:59.343
but I had no idea
she could be like this.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.842
I both respect and fear her.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.892
Oh, it's too cold in here.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.235
I can't feel my baby finger!

14:12.226 --> 14:14.274
Are you supposed
to feel your baby finger?

14:16.397 --> 14:18.399
Dad?! Darkness!

14:18.399 --> 14:20.401
Dang it, all my air conditioners

14:20.401 --> 14:22.699
must've sploofed
our electrical system.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.574
Which is why we have
to poach Hank's electricity

14:25.573 --> 14:26.916
to keep the cold coming.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.331
Help me find
the jumbo extension cord.

14:37.919 --> 14:38.886
Mm...?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.773
Intruder!

15:01.234 --> 15:02.486
I got him!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.786
Dale?! Call Nancy.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.917
You found this in Gwen's desk?

15:13.913 --> 15:14.835
I just can't believe it.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.249
I know.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.922
So, so shameful.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.464
Wade and Gwen
don't deserve to go

15:19.460 --> 15:21.212
anywhere near that parade float.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.512
Nancy, I want you alone
on the News Mountain.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.384
Thank you, Bret.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.057
I will not let you down.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.646
Wow, I got to get this
thing out of the building.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.850
Yes!

15:36.894 --> 15:39.773
Looks like I'll be on top
of the mountain, sugs.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.900
Enjoy the view
from the cheap seats.

15:43.901 --> 15:44.902
Hello?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.904
Nancy! Oh, thank God
I caught you.

15:46.904 --> 15:47.826
Okay, Dale...

15:47.989 --> 15:49.286
Can't talk, sug.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.875
It's my victory party!

15:52.618 --> 15:54.461
Next round's on me, sugs!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.001
Whoo-hoo, yeah!

16:04.505 --> 16:05.882
For the last time, Dale,

16:05.882 --> 16:07.884
I'm sorry my son beat you up.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.888
Even though you're the one
who broke into my house.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.639
Irrelevant.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.061
C-Can someone open my beer?

16:15.057 --> 16:17.230
The pain is too great.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.649
Of course, Dale.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.692
Eh-phtew!

16:20.688 --> 16:21.905
Heh-heh.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.900
That brought me some pleasure.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.369
So, uh, when's Nancy coming home

16:26.360 --> 16:28.704
to deal with, uh, this?

16:28.696 --> 16:30.915
My baby's way too busy for that.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.786
Nancy's top dog
at the station now, Hank.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.331
She's even going to be
in a parade.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.580
Isn't that great?

16:36.579 --> 16:38.502
Wait, Nancy's not coming back

16:38.498 --> 16:39.920
because of a parade?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.964
It does take a lot of focus.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.462
Yes. And I'd like
to be there

16:44.462 --> 16:46.885
to support my wife,
but thanks to your son,

16:46.881 --> 16:48.554
my driving leg is broken.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.347
So as father of my assailant,

16:50.343 --> 16:52.812
I demand you
chauffeur me to Dallas.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.392
All right, fine.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.514
If it'll shut you up.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.903
Vengeance will be mine!

17:00.895 --> 17:02.897
Retracted.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.820
Hey, lady! I'm ready

17:09.987 --> 17:11.660
to ride the mountain!

17:11.656 --> 17:12.656
Have you been drinking?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.375
Ugh, you look terrible.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.210
We need to get you
into makeup, stat.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.579
I could have you killed.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.922
And here comes the entry

17:19.914 --> 17:21.915
from the Dallas
Farm Association.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.135
This is the first time
in Rodeo Days history

17:24.126 --> 17:25.924
a float has been
shaped like corn,

17:25.920 --> 17:28.298
made of corn and fueled by corn.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.265
Better keep it away
from the horses.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.103
Hank, I do not know

17:35.096 --> 17:37.064
what to expect from Nancy today.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.900
Last time we talked,
she was full of herself.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.314
And domestic champagne.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.483
I'm sure she's fine, Peggy.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.277
More baton twirlers?

17:45.273 --> 17:47.696
Where's that tank
they keep talking about?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.410
Look! There's my Nancy!

17:51.320 --> 17:52.697
Nancy!

17:52.697 --> 17:54.870
Nancy, wave at me!

18:00.538 --> 18:03.087
Hello, Dallas!

18:05.918 --> 18:08.137
Hey, goat!

18:14.552 --> 18:16.520
My Nancy!

18:19.390 --> 18:21.813
I'm okay. I'm okay.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.816
Good night.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.907
Nancy Hicks-Gribble, everyone!

18:27.898 --> 18:29.241
Wow.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.860
Yep.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.333
Oh, now this is a nice shot.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.077
I can see why
the Dallas Morning News

18:39.076 --> 18:40.623
put it on their front page.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.749
Bret, I'm so sorry.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.422
So am I. Clean out your desk.
You're fired.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.340
"Fired"?! Bret, wait!

18:48.336 --> 18:49.383
Let me explain.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.595
It was an accident.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.181
I, I, I thought all those drinks

18:52.173 --> 18:53.766
were just orange juice.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.884
Save it, sweetheart.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.057
You disgraced the Mountain.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.182
Clearly some people
weren't made for metro news.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.151
Way to climb your
way to the bottom.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.874
Uh, Nancy?

19:19.033 --> 19:20.910
W-What are you
doing out here?

19:20.910 --> 19:22.878
Waiting for the day to end.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.163
Come on.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.541
So you publicly
humiliated yourself

19:26.540 --> 19:27.917
and got fired for it.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.669
Don't dwell on the past.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.888
There are plenty of things
to look forward to.

19:31.879 --> 19:32.880
Like what?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.382
I'm back where I started.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.886
I got my crappy job back
at crappy Channel 84.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.102
And it's crappy.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.893
Well, that's something.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.061
Gainful employment and whatnot.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.651
Listen, I know it feels
like your dreams

19:45.643 --> 19:48.772
have been crushed forever,
but maybe that's okay.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.320
A smaller market
with less temptation

19:51.315 --> 19:54.865
and fewer opportunities
might be just what you need.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.705
You're right.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.200
A small market
is where I'll shine.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.076
I'll catch the eye
of another big station

20:02.076 --> 20:04.170
by annihilating my competition.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.209
Oh, Miguel has
plenty of skeletons.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.923
I'll systematically destroy him,

20:07.915 --> 20:10.168
and then anyone else
who gets in my way.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.714
Houston is mine!

20:11.711 --> 20:14.635
Nancy, where are you?

20:14.630 --> 20:17.804
I can't reach the fire
extinguisher and I need it!

20:17.967 --> 20:19.890
And I need new toast!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.762
Oh, forget it.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.514
I'm too tired for Houston.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.061
Coming, Dale!

20:26.976 --> 20:28.148
That's it.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.862
It's Dale.
Huh?

20:30.020 --> 20:33.570
Dale and all his nonsense
keeps Nancy so busy,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.785
she doesn't have
the time or energy

20:35.776 --> 20:37.699
to be like she was in Dallas.

20:37.695 --> 20:41.871
So Nancy needs Dale
more than Dale needs Nancy.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.868
Huh. Weird.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.423
That was a close one, huh?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.089
It sure is
great that you're home,

20:52.084 --> 20:54.963
and not just for
fire-retardant purposes.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.384
I missed you.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.890
Channel 84 must be happy
to have you back, too.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.888
It's quite an honor for
them to have a big-time

21:03.888 --> 21:05.856
