WEBVTT

00:03.494 --> 00:04.537
Ooh!

00:04.625 --> 00:06.591
Getting a jump
on the Halloween decorations?

00:06.679 --> 00:08.367
The 'ween dec.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.639
Never. This is from
the window display of my novel,

00:11.727 --> 00:13.376
"A Case of
a Knife to the Brain."

00:13.463 --> 00:14.604
Mm.

00:14.721 --> 00:17.823
You know, we never did do
that book tour across America.

00:17.971 --> 00:20.128
We should do a road trip
when Eddie gets back.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.284
We haven't done one
since we moved down here.

00:22.372 --> 00:23.753
♪ I saw the sign ♪

00:23.966 --> 00:27.534
♪ And it opened up my eyes,
I saw the sign ♪

00:27.622 --> 00:29.362
I'm fine if that was
the last one.

00:29.450 --> 00:30.853
Hey!

00:30.940 --> 00:32.950
Eddie sent us
an e-mail from Taiwan!

00:33.067 --> 00:35.024
From an Internet café.

00:35.111 --> 00:37.160
Oh, man, those babies
are the future.

00:37.247 --> 00:38.557
I bet 10 years from now,

00:38.645 --> 00:40.457
there's two of them
for every Blockbuster.

00:40.567 --> 00:42.365
Print the e-mail
so we can read it.

00:46.403 --> 00:47.972
Here it comes.

00:52.098 --> 00:54.043
"What up, other Huangs.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.489
Taiwan is do-ope.

00:56.715 --> 00:58.768
All the unique
customs..."

01:01.229 --> 01:03.545
"...the Qing dynasty
architecture..."

01:04.873 --> 01:06.397
"...enchanting."

01:06.498 --> 01:09.399
"And don't worry. I'm playing
things safe and smart."

01:09.487 --> 01:10.597
I got this, chief.

01:16.624 --> 01:18.873
Unh! Ugh!

01:19.089 --> 01:20.092
Uggh!

01:20.180 --> 01:22.571
"See you in a few weeks.
Peace out."

01:22.660 --> 01:25.459
And then he drew a skull
out of commas and semicolons.

01:25.547 --> 01:26.775
It's quite good.

01:26.862 --> 01:28.374
Eddie's really getting
our money's worth

01:28.461 --> 01:29.584
out of cultural exchange.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.061
I can't wait
till I get to go.

01:31.149 --> 01:32.948
He had me at
"Qing dynasty architecture."

01:33.078 --> 01:34.617
I'm gonna go hit
the Brittanicas.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.789
We raised some good kids.

01:38.877 --> 01:40.030
We have.

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"No Apology Necessary"</font>

01:58.737 --> 02:00.776
Hey, Emery.
What's wrong?

02:00.864 --> 02:03.248
Too many girlfriends?
They love him.

02:03.336 --> 02:05.953
I got reprimanded at school
for academic dishonesty.

02:06.041 --> 02:06.926
What?!

02:07.014 --> 02:08.217
Remember that video essay

02:08.305 --> 02:10.235
I did with Grandma
for Social Studies?

02:10.323 --> 02:13.039
Well, her language
was a little salty,

02:13.243 --> 02:14.539
so I had to do some editing.

02:14.627 --> 02:18.709
My first boyfriend was
a bricklayer from Malaysia.

02:18.797 --> 02:20.929
He's got strong thighs,

02:21.016 --> 02:24.133
and then we used to stay up
all night long...

02:24.220 --> 02:25.968
Cross-country skiing.

02:31.032 --> 02:32.094
I got caught,

02:32.203 --> 02:34.710
and Principal Hunter's
making me redo the project.

02:34.797 --> 02:35.881
I'm sorry
I got in trouble.

02:35.969 --> 02:37.446
Don't apologize!

02:37.633 --> 02:39.076
It's Grandma's fault.

02:39.164 --> 02:41.047
When you're near the end,
anything goes.

02:43.273 --> 02:45.188
You know,
if this is "trouble,"

02:45.289 --> 02:47.113
we've raised
some pretty good kids.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.844
You know what?
We really have.

02:49.025 --> 02:50.289
Even Eddie.

02:50.407 --> 02:51.860
I thought
he was our throwaway,

02:51.947 --> 02:53.229
but he's really matured.

02:54.384 --> 02:56.952
See, the key
is to lick your palms.

02:58.864 --> 03:00.344
Quick pit stop for gas,

03:00.451 --> 03:02.186
then we hit the street market
for lunch.

03:02.274 --> 03:04.397
Hey, Wendy's!
Let's go there for lunch.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.142
We're not eating
American garbage food.

03:12.268 --> 03:14.758
I'm getting
that cheeseburger.

03:19.942 --> 03:22.825
What is it
with the vehicles here?

03:26.883 --> 03:29.598
Just giving myself
a celebratory blow.

03:29.685 --> 03:31.600
Because...

03:31.750 --> 03:33.703
I got Emery
out of trouble.

03:33.844 --> 03:34.873
You faked his death.

03:34.961 --> 03:36.147
Nope,
we made a video of him

03:36.235 --> 03:37.773
saying "sorry"
in several languages.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.608
We even threw in one
as Sean Connery.

03:39.766 --> 03:41.156
"Shorry."

03:41.703 --> 03:42.875
It's your favorite word.

03:42.963 --> 03:43.991
"Chimichanga"?

03:44.078 --> 03:46.680
No, "sorry."
You say it all the time.

03:46.768 --> 03:47.932
I do?

03:49.640 --> 03:50.828
Sorry.

03:51.470 --> 03:52.618
Watch...
Oh! Uh...

03:52.793 --> 03:54.128
Sorry! Sorry!

03:54.677 --> 03:56.091
Ooh!
Oh! Oh!

03:56.178 --> 03:58.021
Uh, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry. Sorry.

03:58.109 --> 04:00.539
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.

04:01.706 --> 04:03.187
Okay,
maybe I say it a lot,

04:03.275 --> 04:05.200
but only to avoid
senseless conflict.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.936
It cheapens the word
if you say it all the time.

04:08.023 --> 04:09.208
You're a "sorry" slut.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.707
Well, at least I say it.

04:11.794 --> 04:13.242
You should only apologize

04:13.329 --> 04:14.858
when you've actually
done something wrong.

04:14.945 --> 04:16.612
But you never apologize.

04:16.706 --> 04:18.541
Bingo.

04:20.870 --> 04:22.718
Thanks again
for babysitting Maria.

04:22.805 --> 04:24.203
Of course.

04:25.077 --> 04:26.773
Now,
where is the child?

04:28.119 --> 04:29.634
Ah. Yes.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.827
Jessica was right.

04:31.914 --> 04:32.995
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

04:33.082 --> 04:34.663
- Come on, Honey. Let's go.
- Oh.

04:35.745 --> 04:37.693
Now, any governess
worth her frock

04:37.781 --> 04:39.164
comes prepared
with the proper tools.

04:41.476 --> 04:44.843
Music prepares the infant mind
for mathematics.

04:45.039 --> 04:47.232
Problem-solving begins
in the uterus.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.023
Best we catch up, then.

04:49.364 --> 04:52.976
To know ourselves,
we must first know the beasts.

04:53.793 --> 04:58.278
Now, Maria, sometimes a child
needs encouragement to eat.

04:58.537 --> 05:02.052
♪ You are six months,
going on seven months ♪

05:02.140 --> 05:04.468

05:09.452 --> 05:11.013
The citywide traffic jam began

05:11.101 --> 05:13.301
when American exchange student
Eddie Huang

05:13.389 --> 05:14.941
crashed the bus
into a restaurant

05:15.029 --> 05:16.081
for a cheeseburger.

05:16.169 --> 05:17.706
Yo, I didn't crash.

05:17.793 --> 05:19.308
I got stuck.
Big difference.

05:19.395 --> 05:21.644
And I never got
the cheeseburger.

05:21.731 --> 05:22.811
So you're not sorry

05:22.898 --> 05:25.638
you completely shut down
Xinyi District?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.808
It's not my fault the
clearance height was in meters.

05:27.896 --> 05:29.964
I can't be driving
and doing all kinds of math.

05:30.052 --> 05:31.058
It's not safe!

05:31.146 --> 05:32.821
Chimichanga.

05:32.997 --> 05:34.956
Y'all should look into
using feet and miles.

05:35.091 --> 05:36.725
Way less confusing.

05:36.997 --> 05:39.261
So, does this count
as "doing something wrong"?

05:43.604 --> 05:45.219
Hey! Oh!

05:47.000 --> 05:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:56.131 --> 05:58.809
Taiwan, an entire island,
kicked you out!

05:58.926 --> 06:02.418
Yes, but I didn't get
kicked out empty-handed.

06:02.505 --> 06:04.052
I got you all gifts!

06:04.139 --> 06:05.427
Oh. They were stolen.

06:05.515 --> 06:07.831
But there is a crab backpack
in here for Dad.

06:07.919 --> 06:09.257
This isn't funny,
Eddie.

06:09.344 --> 06:10.690
The cultural exchange
program

06:10.778 --> 06:12.487
said they won't
take your brothers now.

06:12.575 --> 06:14.380
Zàijin, Yale!

06:15.356 --> 06:17.590
That means "Goodbye, Yale"
in Mandarin...

06:17.687 --> 06:20.268
The language that you've been
immersed in for over a month!

06:20.482 --> 06:22.571
You know, I feel like we're only
focusing on the negative here.

06:22.658 --> 06:23.747
Positive?

06:23.835 --> 06:24.939
Your boy's home early!

06:25.027 --> 06:26.607
I'm gonna surprise the crap
out of Tina.

06:26.695 --> 06:28.778
No!
No Tina crap surprises.

06:28.868 --> 06:31.646
You are grounded...
For the rest of your life!

06:31.734 --> 06:33.350
And for whatever comes
after that!

06:33.442 --> 06:36.358
You come back as a mushroom,
that mushroom is grounded, too.

06:36.539 --> 06:37.769
How would you
enforce that?

06:37.857 --> 06:38.964
Not now, Emery!

06:39.052 --> 06:40.489
I had
the same question.

06:40.577 --> 06:41.364
Mm.

06:41.452 --> 06:43.560
I thought you had matured,
Eddie.

06:43.648 --> 06:45.355
You got
your driver's license.

06:45.443 --> 06:46.901
You were acting
more responsible.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.193
But you tricked me!

06:48.341 --> 06:50.318
We wanted to raise
good kids,

06:50.427 --> 06:53.099
kids who would make a difference
and stand up for something

06:53.187 --> 06:56.204
and maybe have enough money to
send us to Hawaii twice a year.

06:56.599 --> 06:59.528
But instead,
we raised a cheese-burglar.

06:59.638 --> 07:00.700
Wait, Mom.

07:00.864 --> 07:01.722
I know how you feel about

07:01.810 --> 07:03.497
standing up for something,
and...

07:03.705 --> 07:05.387
- I was.
- What?

07:05.475 --> 07:06.556
Really, I swear I was!

07:06.644 --> 07:09.669
See, what happened was...

07:10.135 --> 07:11.408
Cheeseburger.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.177
We're not eating
American garbage food.

07:14.896 --> 07:16.112
You guys are soft.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.599
Hey! I'm not soft!

07:17.939 --> 07:19.454
And neither are
my parents,

07:19.572 --> 07:21.996
especially my beautiful
and ageless mother.

07:22.084 --> 07:24.733
Yeah, well, uh,
your parents are fools,

07:24.820 --> 07:26.167
and so is your country.

07:26.255 --> 07:27.269
Boom!

07:28.513 --> 07:31.630
I'm not gonna let you disrespect
my parents or my homeland.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.145
Are we gonna let him insult

07:33.232 --> 07:34.777
our brilliant mothers
and native soil?

07:34.864 --> 07:36.579
And let him deny us
cheeseburgers?

07:36.666 --> 07:37.589
No! No!
No! No!

07:37.677 --> 07:39.044
No, we are not.

07:39.132 --> 07:40.255
USA!

07:40.369 --> 07:41.399
USA!

07:41.487 --> 07:42.619
USA!

07:42.707 --> 07:43.855
USA!

07:43.943 --> 07:45.097
USA!

07:45.185 --> 07:46.254
USA!

07:46.341 --> 07:47.490
USA!

07:47.577 --> 07:49.487
USA! USA!

07:49.575 --> 07:52.427
It was like that movie
"Braveheart," minus the skirts.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.363
No matter what, you can't
just take a bus on a joyride.

07:55.450 --> 07:56.599
You're not a kid
anymore,

07:56.686 --> 07:58.708
and you can't make waves
in a different country.

07:59.288 --> 08:00.911
No, Eddie was right.

08:01.762 --> 08:03.294
- He was?
- I was?

08:03.392 --> 08:05.716
You stood up for yourself,
like you should have.

08:05.890 --> 08:07.372
Eternity grounding lifted.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.458
Yes! You heard her!
She said it! No take-backs!

08:16.989 --> 08:18.341
Ooh!

08:18.707 --> 08:20.341
Evan likey.

08:21.443 --> 08:23.956
So, if Eddie makes a formal
apology, then you'll let

08:24.044 --> 08:26.214
our other sons participate
in cultural exchange?

08:26.302 --> 08:28.063
No apology necessary.
Bye-bye!

08:28.150 --> 08:30.733
Jessica! I was making a deal
with the exchange program.

08:30.820 --> 08:33.802
If Eddie just apologizes,
the boys can go to Taiwan.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.910
So you want him to just
roll over and play dead like...

08:37.027 --> 08:39.943
some kind of animal
that rolls over and plays dead?

08:40.062 --> 08:42.068
This just isn't worth it,
Jessica.

08:42.528 --> 08:44.647
Look, I get
the instinct to fight.

08:44.734 --> 08:48.021
When I first moved here, I never
backed down from anything.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.183
Whoa. Relax there,
fresh-off-the-boat.

08:52.271 --> 08:53.513
I was here first.

08:55.510 --> 08:56.862
Okay, here's
what's gonna happen.

08:56.950 --> 08:58.308
I'm going to
punch your throat,

08:58.396 --> 09:00.020
then kick your throat,
then chop your throat,

09:00.107 --> 09:01.599
and that's just
your throat.

09:02.448 --> 09:03.958
You never told me
that story.

09:04.046 --> 09:05.733
Yeah, because
he beat the hell out of me.

09:05.821 --> 09:08.236
That's why my jaw clicks
whenever I eat a Tootsie Roll.

09:08.323 --> 09:10.042
Still, it was good
that I lost.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.757
I'm not sure
you understand fights.

09:12.038 --> 09:14.347
I realized
you have to pick your battles.

09:14.435 --> 09:15.944
You want to fight
every injustice,

09:16.031 --> 09:17.349
especially
as a new immigrant,

09:17.437 --> 09:19.853
but some dumb comment
in a grocery store

09:19.969 --> 09:21.917
wasn't worth it,
and neither is this.

09:22.004 --> 09:24.186
Eddie made a mistake.
He should apologize.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.224
Well, that's just not how
I want to raise our boys.

09:27.380 --> 09:29.177
If they feel like
they've been wronged,

09:29.265 --> 09:31.308
they should fight...
Every time.

09:36.726 --> 09:37.874
Peek-a-boo!

09:39.943 --> 09:41.136
Peek-a-boo!

09:42.357 --> 09:44.106
Peek-a-boo!
Peek-a-boo!

09:45.549 --> 09:48.620
Will you just take
the flippin' bottle?!

09:50.528 --> 09:52.126
Aha!

09:53.768 --> 09:55.850
Guess we'll do this
the hard way.

09:57.274 --> 09:59.541
Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb!

10:07.838 --> 10:09.259
Permission
to come aboard.

10:09.384 --> 10:11.124
- Hey!
- Hey.

10:11.212 --> 10:12.768
- I hope we're not interrupting.
- Mm.

10:12.855 --> 10:15.170
We just wanted to talk
about Evan's babysitting.

10:15.257 --> 10:16.805
He's been a little...

10:17.016 --> 10:18.157
Harsh.

10:18.283 --> 10:19.540
- Harsh?
- Harsh?

10:24.501 --> 10:26.114
There's a camera
inside the bear.

10:26.201 --> 10:27.783
Uhh... what?

10:27.985 --> 10:30.919
Peek-a-boo! There's one in
the moose at the country club,

10:31.006 --> 10:32.688
so be sure to keep
your limericks clean.

10:36.779 --> 10:38.661
If you don't drink
your milk,

10:38.748 --> 10:40.629
this is
what's gonna happen.

10:42.617 --> 10:43.666
Evan!

10:45.357 --> 10:47.933
We'll handle this.
I'm really sorry, guys.

10:48.021 --> 10:49.699
They just wanted
to tell us, Louis.

10:49.787 --> 10:51.183
They didn't come
for an apology.

10:51.271 --> 10:53.642
I mean, it wouldn't be the
craziest thing in the world...

10:53.729 --> 10:55.010
Uh, let's go, Honey.
Come on. Okay.

10:58.849 --> 10:59.814
What was that?!

10:59.902 --> 11:02.230
Okay, I didn't
actually spank her.

11:02.318 --> 11:04.519
I was simply suggesting
an alternative outcome

11:04.607 --> 11:06.263
if she refused
the bottle.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.324
Look, this isn't gonna be
popular, what I'm about to say,

11:09.411 --> 11:10.966
but here it comes...

11:11.146 --> 11:12.534
She a bitch.

11:12.622 --> 11:14.496
Evan,
that's my goddaughter!

11:14.583 --> 11:16.560
Hey, I'm just
standing up for myself.

11:16.648 --> 11:17.659
Like Eddie!

11:19.117 --> 11:21.607
Chimichanga!
This house is out of control!

11:21.708 --> 11:24.888
Now your "no apology" philosophy
has corrupted Evan, too!

11:29.131 --> 11:30.522
Ma, please tell me

11:30.631 --> 11:32.162
this meeting's to announce
a new phone number.

11:32.249 --> 11:33.334
I can't hit up Tina

11:33.422 --> 11:35.582
because that Taiwanese reporter
won't stop calling.

11:35.670 --> 11:38.381
And I had to
unplug my phone.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.010
I wanted to announce that
I spoke to the exchange program,

11:42.253 --> 11:45.051
and the boys
can now participate!

11:45.139 --> 11:47.006
Yes! This is why you lead us.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.590
I realized that sometimes
you do have to compromise

11:50.678 --> 11:51.848
for the good of others.

11:51.936 --> 11:53.401
So Eddie's
going to apologize.

11:53.597 --> 11:56.084
Good God, no.
I made a deal.

11:56.172 --> 11:57.172
Lei?

11:58.949 --> 12:01.729
Boys,
meet your new sister.

12:02.573 --> 12:04.894
Greetings, host family.

12:09.266 --> 12:10.881
Isn't this exciting?!

12:10.983 --> 12:13.417
Lei's host family
in Minnesota fell through

12:13.505 --> 12:15.417
because they got lost
in that big mall,

12:15.505 --> 12:16.854
so now she's ours.

12:16.942 --> 12:19.126
Girl,
fetch me a Zima.

12:19.214 --> 12:21.463
Jenny,
she's not our servant.

12:21.550 --> 12:22.589
Ohh.

12:22.679 --> 12:24.792
She's part of the family
for the next year.

12:25.156 --> 12:26.768
Boys,
show Lei to her room.

12:26.856 --> 12:27.696
Where's her room?

12:27.784 --> 12:29.235
Your room.
The hell?!

12:30.497 --> 12:31.931
You can move in
with your brothers.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.464
- The hell?!
- The hell?!

12:34.783 --> 12:35.979
Come on, Lei.

12:36.112 --> 12:38.149
FYI, the nightstand
is off-limits...

12:38.237 --> 12:39.114
For your own safety.

12:39.263 --> 12:41.472
Do you know
the Backstreet Boys?

12:42.783 --> 12:44.085
Now, don't get me wrong.

12:44.173 --> 12:45.387
I am already
starting to plan

12:45.474 --> 12:47.323
some father/exchange-daughter
activities,

12:47.411 --> 12:50.239
but wouldn't it just be easier
if Eddie apologizes?

12:50.333 --> 12:51.960
You wanted the boys
back in the program,

12:52.047 --> 12:53.495
so I took care of it.

12:53.582 --> 12:55.330
You won't even know
she's here.

13:35.057 --> 13:37.893
Yes, this is
Cheeseburger Boy's family.

13:39.394 --> 13:40.943
Eddie, why can't you
make your bed?

13:41.120 --> 13:43.792
This is our fire lane.
It's got to stay clear.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.704
If I roll it up,
it won't dry.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.595
Why is it wet
in the first place?

13:47.683 --> 13:48.817
Because of
my sleep soda.

13:48.904 --> 13:50.729
One of you turds
kicked it over last night.

13:50.824 --> 13:53.081
And why does Lei
get her own room?

13:53.242 --> 13:55.858
Do I get one if I pick up
an instrument twice my size?

13:55.945 --> 13:57.459
Because I can go harp.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.995
I can go harp lickety-split
like a crazy man!

14:00.082 --> 14:02.159
Dude, Evan's
really freaking out.

14:02.844 --> 14:05.157
Not so fun when someone
newer and cuter shows up.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.568
Welcome to irrelevance.

14:06.655 --> 14:08.536
Population...
Nobody's counting.

14:08.675 --> 14:10.638
That's it!

14:10.725 --> 14:12.862
That's why
Maria's in such a bad mood.

14:14.370 --> 14:17.643
Honey's new baby
is Maria's Lei.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.136
Just nod along.

14:22.304 --> 14:23.897
Hey, hey. Hi.

14:24.581 --> 14:25.884
How are we doing
with Lei?

14:25.972 --> 14:27.587
Not great, Pops.

14:27.675 --> 14:29.024
Yeah, this is a mess.

14:29.111 --> 14:30.725
All she does is shower
and bake cakes.

14:30.812 --> 14:31.893
I gained 10 pounds.

14:31.981 --> 14:33.195
10 dirty pounds.

14:33.286 --> 14:35.046
Shh! It's Lei!
Act natural!

14:38.423 --> 14:40.321
Hey, Evan, do you still have
your Beanie Babies?

14:40.409 --> 14:42.493
Lei wants to know
about American toys.

14:43.142 --> 14:44.376
No.

14:44.576 --> 14:47.045
Jessica, we need to talk about Lei.
Close the door, please.

14:47.133 --> 14:50.436
No. Louis, quit complaining
about your host daughter!

14:50.524 --> 14:52.114
She's a sweet girl!

14:52.201 --> 14:53.348
She showers regularly,

14:53.435 --> 14:55.298
she knows her way
around a cake tin,

14:55.386 --> 14:57.701
and I haven't heard a peep
from her all week.

14:58.016 --> 14:59.721
Lei is on TV!

15:05.471 --> 15:06.518
Damn it, Eddie!

15:06.606 --> 15:08.855
This is why we keep
the fire lane clear!

15:19.861 --> 15:22.564
See? They turn everyone
into a villain.

15:28.117 --> 15:31.251
Nobody asked you
to make delicious cakes!

15:38.254 --> 15:41.846
You left before Lei told Taiwan
I'm vain about my hair!

15:41.934 --> 15:43.196
What a liar, right?

15:43.298 --> 15:44.175
I know.

15:44.263 --> 15:45.633
Taiwan sent us a dud.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.135
Maybe I can trade her in.

15:47.222 --> 15:48.622
They did mention
a set of twins.

15:48.710 --> 15:50.504
She's not a dud,
Jessica.

15:50.592 --> 15:52.774
And her German chocolate
is wunderbar.

15:52.974 --> 15:55.503
The problem is,
you upended this whole family

15:55.591 --> 15:58.052
all because
you refuse to apologize.

15:58.867 --> 16:00.482
You're right.

16:00.684 --> 16:03.224
Her German chocolate
is excellent.

16:03.372 --> 16:05.988
But her buttercream is
a little bit "grocery store."

16:06.075 --> 16:07.289
Jessica!

16:07.376 --> 16:09.589
Eddie stole a bus
to eat a cheeseburger.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.911
You know he wasn't really
standing up for something.

16:12.590 --> 16:14.639
Fine!
I knew he was lying.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.300
Maybe I was just looking
for an excuse to save him.

16:17.388 --> 16:18.800
Save him from what?

16:19.138 --> 16:21.036
When I first moved
to this country,

16:21.270 --> 16:23.636
I didn't know the language
or the culture.

16:23.724 --> 16:25.520
I would
shrink my shoulders,

16:25.727 --> 16:28.610
put my head down,
and try to be invisible.

16:28.747 --> 16:30.212
The immigrant shrivel.

16:30.536 --> 16:32.872
A model minority.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.723
I didn't want
to cause any trouble,

16:35.870 --> 16:38.364
so I apologized
all the time,

16:38.540 --> 16:40.942
even when I wasn't wrong,
like you do.

16:41.075 --> 16:44.104
Until one day,
back when I was teaching,

16:44.192 --> 16:46.168
I gave this kid an F.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.370
He got upset,

16:47.458 --> 16:49.663
and he told his parents
that I shouted at him,

16:49.751 --> 16:51.199
which I didn't do,

16:51.286 --> 16:54.051
but instead of
standing up for myself,

16:54.456 --> 16:55.903
I agreed to apologize.

16:55.991 --> 16:59.332
I'm very sorry
for what happened with Steven.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.840
Please accept
my apology.

17:02.036 --> 17:03.512
Thank you.

17:04.598 --> 17:06.080
You're still gonna
fire her, right?

17:06.167 --> 17:09.106
We'd hate to have to tell
the school board about this.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.200
Uh...

17:10.292 --> 17:11.368
Yes.

17:11.457 --> 17:13.948
I suppose that is
the only appropriate move.

17:14.036 --> 17:15.057
What?

17:15.144 --> 17:16.090
You understand, Jessica.

17:16.178 --> 17:18.036
It's just easier
this way.

17:18.482 --> 17:20.926
I did everything
they wanted me to,

17:21.015 --> 17:22.651
but I still lost my job.

17:22.739 --> 17:25.598
I felt
so powerless and weak.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.582
I don't want the boys
to ever feel that.

17:28.903 --> 17:32.418
Eddie being alone
in a new country,

17:32.543 --> 17:35.395
like we were,
brought all that back.

17:35.895 --> 17:39.082
And in two years, he's gonna be
out on his own for good.

17:39.747 --> 17:41.317
Jessica...

17:42.537 --> 17:44.119
we have great kids.

17:44.206 --> 17:46.254
And they have the strongest
mother in the world.

17:46.426 --> 17:47.689
I am strong.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.757
But even great kids
make mistakes.

17:49.844 --> 17:51.879
Eddie owning that
won't make him weak.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.151
Saying sorry is one of
the hardest things you ever do.

17:56.069 --> 17:59.372
If the boys learn to do that,
it'll only make them stronger.

18:05.194 --> 18:06.708
Thanks for having me over.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.310
There's something
I need to say to Maria.

18:09.311 --> 18:11.200
That's so sweet.

18:11.301 --> 18:13.148
Maria, I forgive you.

18:13.236 --> 18:14.216
Huh?

18:14.304 --> 18:15.583
I thought you hated me
because you had

18:15.670 --> 18:17.455
all the compassion
of a bag of sand.

18:17.543 --> 18:19.487
But then I realized
it's not about me.

18:19.684 --> 18:22.090
You were just upset a new baby's
gonna take your place,

18:22.178 --> 18:24.192
but nobody
could ever do that.

18:26.348 --> 18:28.230
There's that smile!

18:28.317 --> 18:29.231
But she's
not smiling...

18:29.318 --> 18:30.567
No,
let him have this.

18:30.661 --> 18:32.684
He's working through
something.

18:38.227 --> 18:39.848
After Eddie apologizes,

18:39.936 --> 18:42.364
your other sons
can participate in the program,

18:42.452 --> 18:44.252
and Lei will go
to another home.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.551
Close to
a Planet Hollywood?

18:46.957 --> 18:48.247
Just to be clear...

18:48.398 --> 18:50.557
If you had actually
been standing up for yourself,

18:50.645 --> 18:52.086
I would never
let you do this.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.221
You knew I was lying?

18:53.309 --> 18:55.096
I always know
when you're lying.

18:55.184 --> 18:56.987
Plus, you are not
charismatic enough

18:57.075 --> 18:59.979
to get a bus full of children
to chant "USA."

19:00.067 --> 19:01.529
I know.

19:01.616 --> 19:02.616
Sorry, Ma.

19:03.552 --> 19:04.832
I must admit,
I do love the word

19:04.919 --> 19:06.534
when it's coming
in my direction.

19:06.621 --> 19:08.803
So maybe you'll start
saying it yourself?

19:08.890 --> 19:11.473
Oh, Louis,
I love your optimism.

19:11.590 --> 19:13.973
Okay.
Here come the words.

19:14.715 --> 19:15.848
Mm.

19:15.936 --> 19:18.145
I'm sorry I took the tour bus
and crashed it

19:18.233 --> 19:19.948
and shut down
half of Taipei.

19:20.036 --> 19:23.153
It was immature,
and I'm really sorry.

19:24.754 --> 19:25.953
Thank you
for this opportunity

19:26.040 --> 19:27.889
and for lifting the ban
on our boys.

19:27.976 --> 19:30.520
Uh, well,
it would go a long way

19:30.668 --> 19:32.627
if you two
also expressed some remorse...

19:32.714 --> 19:36.223
For raising
such a reckless son?

19:40.254 --> 19:41.869
Uh, Jessica,
remember...

19:41.956 --> 19:43.918
Sometimes
you just have to apologize.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.875
Now is not
one of those times.

19:47.962 --> 19:49.311
Okay. Here's what's gonna happen.

19:49.398 --> 19:50.812
I'm going to
punch your throat,

19:50.899 --> 19:52.895
then kick your throat,
then chop your throat.

19:53.028 --> 19:54.887
And that's
just your throat.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.742
Bye, Lei!

20:03.278 --> 20:05.227
I borrowed 100 bucks
from her.

20:05.314 --> 20:06.361
She'll never see it.

20:06.448 --> 20:09.331
I'm impressed you got us
out of that meeting

20:09.418 --> 20:10.543
without apologizing.

20:10.631 --> 20:12.864
Hmm. I'm just glad I didn't
have to fight that guy.

20:12.952 --> 20:15.713
He seemed like the type who
secretly has a rocked-up core.

20:15.801 --> 20:18.028
- Wiry. Like Linda Hamilton.
- Mm.

20:19.294 --> 20:21.948
God bless whoever
winds up with that monster.

20:25.832 --> 20:27.043
Okay.

20:32.374 --> 20:34.121
Hey, can we hit
that drive-thru?

20:34.208 --> 20:35.276
- No! - No!
- No! - No!

20:35.364 --> 20:37.002
Oh,
that reminds me, Eddie.

20:37.090 --> 20:39.794
You are un-un-grounded,
Cheeseburger Boy.

20:39.881 --> 20:41.260
What? Mom,
you can't ground me.

20:41.348 --> 20:42.764
I'm gonna be
a junior in high school.

20:42.851 --> 20:44.266
That means I own you
for another two,

20:44.353 --> 20:45.557
possibly three years.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.218
And I'm gonna make sure
those years

20:47.306 --> 20:49.075
feel as long as possible.

20:51.614 --> 20:54.208
Hey, you can still listen
to music, Eddie. You love music!

20:55.964 --> 20:57.176
