00:01.830 --> 00:02.900
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.900 --> 00:03.900
You were testing
on yourself?

00:03.930 --> 00:06.570
If there's a chance to
cure the Death Date, I
have to figure it out.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.870
Zeke, what is this?

00:07.900 --> 00:09.940
Frostbite.
I may be freezing to death.

00:09.970 --> 00:12.040
Saanvi thinks she can help.
She may have a cure.

00:12.070 --> 00:14.610
I think I did it.
DNA has no anomaly.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.740
Michaela:
My gut is telling me that
Jared's involved in something

00:16.780 --> 00:18.480
that could cause
some serious problems.

00:18.510 --> 00:20.150
You've proven
quite valuable.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.880
I'm on the verge of exposing the
828ers for the threat they are.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.080
Conor: Your case files.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.450
Drea wanted you
to print these?

00:25.490 --> 00:26.520
No, it was Vasquez.

00:26.550 --> 00:27.760
We got Vasquez, Captain.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.190
I'll take it from here.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.620
Alex: Us. In the park.

00:30.660 --> 00:31.930
That was a mistake.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.690
I don't remember
being at the park.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.130
I don't remember a thing.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.800
TJ: Yusuv Al-Zuras.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.870
According to legend,
he was lost at sea for 10 years

00:38.900 --> 00:39.930
and mysteriously returned.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.740
Sounds familiar.

00:41.770 --> 00:44.640
The possibility that all of this
has happened before, it's huge.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.740
No way. They found it --
Al-Zuras' journal.

00:46.770 --> 00:48.610
Figured we'd get
some answers.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.040
Ben:
This changes everything.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.270
It's all connected.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.750
All this,
and he makes breakfast.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.650
I figure if there's a chance
we're gonna be normal,

01:59.680 --> 02:01.220
we might as well start trying
to live like it.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.080
Mm. Saanvi still thinks she has
the cure for the Death Date?

02:04.120 --> 02:07.150
Hope so. She says I passed
the preliminary testing.

02:07.190 --> 02:09.620
We'll see
how phase two goes.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.230
It'd be nice not to be
freezing to death.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.890
Oh.

02:12.930 --> 02:16.200
FYI, my "normal" is just coffee
and last night's pizza.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.030
This is
downright domestic.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.200
Hmm.

02:20.230 --> 02:21.800
Still want that pizza?

02:21.840 --> 02:22.800
No.

02:24.670 --> 02:27.240
Only good thing
my father ever taught me.

02:27.270 --> 02:29.710
You don't talk about your dad
that much.

02:29.740 --> 02:31.080
Not much to say.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.610
Guy took off.

02:33.650 --> 02:37.850
Happier subject --
Say Saanvi's cure works.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.620
What do you
want to do first?

02:40.650 --> 02:42.820
Escape.

02:42.860 --> 02:45.030
I don't know.
Take a year, see the world.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.790
Hmm. You do realize

02:46.830 --> 02:48.200
that involves getting on
a plane, right?

02:48.230 --> 02:50.860
Ooh.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.330
Where do we go?

02:52.370 --> 02:55.970
Chile?
Greece? Thailand?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.340
Um, anywhere that's not Jamaica
would be great.

03:01.070 --> 03:03.010
Crap, I gotta go.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.180
I really don't want to go deal
with this whole Jared thing.

03:05.210 --> 03:06.910
If he really is
working with the Xers,

03:06.950 --> 03:08.750
the quicker you take him down,
the better,

03:08.780 --> 03:10.180
as far as I'm concerned.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.990
Or I could just, uh,
come see Saanvi with you.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.760
Trying to be normal,
remember?

03:15.790 --> 03:17.960
Which means you go to work.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.930
I'm a big boy.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.260
Perfectly capable of going
to the doctor by myself.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.330
Fine, but I'm gonna
spend the whole day

03:24.360 --> 03:27.640
making travel plans,
then.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.170
Bye.
I'm taking this.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.240
Okay. You should.

03:34.070 --> 03:35.210
Here, lemme help.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.010
It's okay.
I-I-I got it.

03:38.050 --> 03:41.180
Thanks for letting me
stay here while I recover.

03:41.210 --> 03:43.820
And for, you know,
saving my life.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.020
It was
my absolute pleasure.

03:47.050 --> 03:48.860
We're happy
to have you.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.830
Right, 'cause things around here
weren't hectic enough already

03:51.860 --> 03:54.660
without an unexpected
houseguest.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.360
I don't know.
You doing okay?

03:57.400 --> 04:01.270
I mean, all those people died,
and the Callings saved me.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.340
I guess
I just don't get it.

04:03.370 --> 04:06.810
TJ, there are
so many things

04:06.840 --> 04:08.380
I wish we understood
about the Callings,

04:08.410 --> 04:11.050
but right now all that matters
is you're safe.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.310
And the only thing
you need to do is heal.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.850
Hey.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.950
-You ready?
-Uh, yeah. Yeah.

04:19.990 --> 04:23.690
Olive, why don't you let TJ rest
for a few days, recover a bit?

04:23.720 --> 04:26.830
No, okay?
I'm sick of losing people.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.430
I just got
you guys back.

04:28.460 --> 04:31.870
If the key to surviving
is in this journal,

04:31.900 --> 04:35.440
then I-I'm not gonna waste
another minute.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.040
TJ: It's okay.

04:37.070 --> 04:40.170
Maybe it'll help
take my mind off the fire.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.440
You sure?

04:41.480 --> 04:42.880
Yeah.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.780
Alright, then.

04:45.810 --> 04:48.480
I'm gonna go make sure
Cal's not still in his PJs.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.890
You know, Cal,
it comes with instructions

04:56.920 --> 04:59.330
and all the hardware
to put it together.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.260
Somehow I don't think
he's trying to make a crib.

05:08.540 --> 05:10.000
What are you building?

05:10.040 --> 05:11.970
Why won't it work?

05:12.010 --> 05:14.840
It's supposed to work.
It's all connected.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.010
Cal, did you
have a Calling?

05:19.050 --> 05:20.810
Come on!

05:20.850 --> 05:23.420
Honey, can we help?

05:23.450 --> 05:27.090
Cal, if you had a Calling,
we need to know.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.890
What did you see?

05:28.920 --> 05:31.860
I can't remember.
It -- It was like a dream.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.760
But I think --

05:34.800 --> 05:37.970
I think I was there
when the plane disappeared.

05:40.130 --> 05:42.240
You know what happened
to Flight 828?

06:07.590 --> 06:09.100
Internal affairs?

06:09.130 --> 06:10.830
You know, I appreciate you
having my back

06:10.860 --> 06:13.070
Always?
the way
I've always had yours.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.400
Your new friends think
my family and I are subhuman.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.270
Mick, the box
you just opened,

06:18.310 --> 06:19.810
okay, you don't get
what's inside.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.840
You know what I don't get,
Jared, is you.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.510
Bowers: Stone.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.950
These people need
a bit of your time.

06:31.590 --> 06:32.920
Big day.

06:32.950 --> 06:36.290
Ah!

06:36.320 --> 06:38.060
Ready to save my life?

06:38.090 --> 06:39.530
Yes. Um, yeah.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.130
Yes, I've just --
I've been working all night.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.300
Sorry.

06:48.130 --> 06:50.200
You alright?

06:50.240 --> 06:52.010
I had this, like,
really weird thing with my ex,

06:52.040 --> 06:53.070
and it just
stirred me up.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.180
I mean, don't worry.
I'm just --

06:56.210 --> 06:58.410
I'm overcompensating with work.
It's just...

06:58.450 --> 07:00.480
That's one way to do things.

07:00.510 --> 07:03.180
It's tried and true.
Okay.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.450
Let's see.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.250
Let's, um --
Let's get started.

07:10.590 --> 07:13.930
Saanvi, please don't
take this the wrong way,

07:13.960 --> 07:15.360
but are you on something?

07:15.400 --> 07:18.000
No. I'm fine.

07:18.030 --> 07:19.600
Really?
Because you seem really wired.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.970
No, I just, uh -- Since I
injected myself with the serum,

07:22.000 --> 07:23.500
I've had minor, um...

07:23.540 --> 07:25.370
just minor
impulse-control issues.

07:25.410 --> 07:28.010
Oh.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.410
I'm not the doctor, but it
doesn't seem all that minor.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.050
It's just
a temporary side effect.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.150
The Callings changed
our brain chemistry,

07:35.180 --> 07:37.220
and now that they're gone,
it's gonna take

07:37.250 --> 07:39.650
just a little bit of time for
my body to get back to normal.

07:39.690 --> 07:41.960
Put your arm out.
Let's get started.

07:41.990 --> 07:44.320
Uh, I'm not sure
an impulse-control issue

07:44.360 --> 07:46.230
is the best thing
for a recovering addict.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.000
It's just
a temporary issue.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.300
It's just my brain chemistry's
getting back to normal.

07:50.330 --> 07:52.230
You're repeating yourself.

07:53.470 --> 07:55.500
Okay, your serum
was right here.

07:59.170 --> 08:01.280
Oh! Yes!

08:04.310 --> 08:06.180
Okay.

08:06.210 --> 08:08.520
Let's, uh --
Let's get started.

08:08.550 --> 08:12.950
I'm gonna prepare the serum,
and it shouldn't take too long.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.160
Internal Affairs?
Really?

08:21.190 --> 08:22.630
You think
I had a choice?

08:22.660 --> 08:24.700
Stone had tape connecting you
to the Xers.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.170
If I didn't
run it up the ladder,

08:26.200 --> 08:27.430
she would have
done it herself.

08:27.470 --> 08:29.040
At least this way,
I can control it.

08:29.070 --> 08:30.640
An investigation about me,
Captain.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.440
Nobody said
this was gonna be easy.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.670
I've got all bases covered.

08:33.710 --> 08:35.680
If Stone gets anywhere
with it,

08:35.710 --> 08:37.680
Meantime, she gets to say
I can undercut her
and make it go away.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.380
whatever the hell she wants
to the rat squad.

08:39.410 --> 08:42.220
We got to play this out
like any other investigation.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.560
We're very interested
in what you have to say.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.330
Appreciate you taking the time,
Detective.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.600
Thank you guys for being able
to jump in so quick.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.300
I-I just, uh, need to state
for the record

08:57.330 --> 08:58.970
that you are here
voluntarily,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.700
that you have a right to
representation from the union --

09:01.740 --> 09:05.640
No, I, uh -- I just want
to do the right thing.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.410
Good.
Then we're on the same page.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.740
Let's start
at the beginning.

09:09.780 --> 09:13.080
You have a long history with
Detective Vasquez, correct?

09:13.110 --> 09:16.320
Yeah.
Um, you know what?

09:16.350 --> 09:18.050
He -- He's a great guy.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.450
He's always been
kind and caring.

09:20.490 --> 09:22.660
This is all
kind of unexpected.

09:22.690 --> 09:26.290
Uh, Detective Vasquez
separated from his wife

09:26.330 --> 09:28.060
after you came back
on Flight 828.

09:28.090 --> 09:29.460
The two of you
got back together?

09:29.500 --> 09:33.200
Uh, no, not exactly.
W-We had a --

09:33.230 --> 09:35.170
I'm not looking
to split hairs.

09:39.340 --> 09:42.380
Uh, we made a mistake.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.680
I think, you know,
Jared took that hard,

09:44.710 --> 09:47.380
and I-I can only assume
that's what caused him

09:47.410 --> 09:49.080
to turn to the Xers.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.250
Did your partnership sour
before or after you accused him

09:52.290 --> 09:55.620
of attacking the man that you
were romantically involved with?

09:55.660 --> 09:57.360
I don't see
how Zeke is in--

09:57.390 --> 09:58.760
Did you find yourself
in need

09:58.790 --> 10:00.690
of some character rehabilitation
at the precinct?

10:00.730 --> 10:03.130
In need of a win?

10:03.160 --> 10:05.630
I'm sorry, uh,

10:05.670 --> 10:08.140
what exactly are you guys
driving at?

10:08.170 --> 10:10.470
We're trying to understand
why you seem to have a vendetta

10:10.500 --> 10:12.110
against a man
you almost married.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.640
Uh, no.
No, no, no.

10:13.670 --> 10:15.640
I'm concerned that the people
he's associating with

10:15.680 --> 10:17.740
might be involved
with illegal activity.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.780
So you resent
the new woman he's seeing.

10:19.810 --> 10:23.520
That's not at all
what I said.

10:23.550 --> 10:28.660
Okay, I understand that you
need to vet my credibility,

10:28.690 --> 10:31.560
but why do I get the sense that
you think that I'm the bad guy?

10:31.590 --> 10:32.830
Why do you have
my case file?

10:32.860 --> 10:34.800
We have a few questions
about your case work

10:34.830 --> 10:36.700
since being reinstated
after 828's return.

10:36.730 --> 10:39.370
More than a few,
actually.

10:39.400 --> 10:44.810
Uh, you did not just
happen upon these yourselves.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.410
Jared gave those to you
to save himself.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.610
We are here to discuss his
involvement with a hate group.

10:50.640 --> 10:55.550
Case after case of yours seems
to involve rescues or solves

10:55.580 --> 10:57.780
with no evidentiary trail
whatsoever.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.850
Recovery
of two kidnapped girls.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.820
Murder of
a barbershop owner.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.360
Murder of
a college student.

11:04.390 --> 11:05.660
Ah. Hmm.

11:05.690 --> 11:09.200
Bank robbery
by an 828 passenger.

11:09.230 --> 11:13.770
Oh, this is a fun one.
Your boyfriend was involved.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.740
Great. Fine.
Let's start here.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.370
But if you don't accept
my explanation of these cases,

11:19.410 --> 11:21.710
then where exactly
is this heading?

11:21.740 --> 11:24.480
To a long prison term,
Detective.

11:31.350 --> 11:34.120
Alright,
think hard, Cal.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.120
What did you see?
What happened to the plane?

11:36.160 --> 11:38.730
I can't remember.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.800
I just have to build it.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.700
Build what?

11:44.570 --> 11:47.140
It's okay.
Just take it easy.

11:47.170 --> 11:49.140
Ben, I haven't seen him
this worked up

11:49.170 --> 11:50.670
about a Calling
in a while.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.310
Alright.
Let me help.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.680
What's it
supposed to look like?

11:55.710 --> 11:58.510
Like a spider web.
The plane was trapped in it.

12:00.550 --> 12:01.650
You okay?

12:01.680 --> 12:02.820
Yeah, fine.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.750
I'm just feeling
a bit woozy.

12:04.790 --> 12:08.690
I thought
the morning sickness was over.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.360
What can I do?

12:10.390 --> 12:12.560
Here, hold this
while I tie it.

12:16.530 --> 12:17.870
So, what makes you
so convinced

12:17.900 --> 12:19.770
that this journal
is the key to everything

12:19.800 --> 12:21.840
and we're the ones
who were supposed to find it?

12:21.870 --> 12:25.370
Because the tarot card
that led to all of this,

12:25.410 --> 12:27.810
it -- it came to me
when you guys were missing.

12:27.840 --> 12:31.580
And the book is in Latin.
And you know Latin.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.310
Oh, so my life was spared

12:33.350 --> 12:35.850
because the Callings don't know
how to use Google Translate.

12:35.880 --> 12:40.390
Well, I do, okay,
and all I got was gibberish.
Great.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.720
TJ, none of this
was an accident.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.960
Your survival,
my survival.

12:44.990 --> 12:48.600
We're -- We're all
in this together.

12:48.630 --> 12:50.970
I know.
You're right.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.710
Okay, here we go.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.380
Al-Zuras was definitely
like us.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.250
"After a decade,
we arrived.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.850
But for the men on board,
no time had passed.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.590
Each of us was as young
as when we left,

13:12.620 --> 13:15.920
only now we could hear
the word of God."

13:15.960 --> 13:17.790
The Callings.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.890
"Lumen" was the word
they used.

13:19.930 --> 13:23.630
"Glow."
They thought it was a-a curse.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.570
Callings, they do good.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.270
I don't -- I don't know
why they would think --

13:27.300 --> 13:28.540
Well,
according to Al-Zuras,

13:28.570 --> 13:31.370
"For every blessing,
a price must be paid.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.670
We returned after
10 revolutions of the sun,

13:33.710 --> 13:37.980
only to learn our lives would
be taken after just 10 more."

13:38.010 --> 13:40.280
He had his own
Death Date.

13:42.650 --> 13:46.550
"And for every good
that comes from the Voice,

13:46.590 --> 13:48.990
a trial must follow."

13:49.020 --> 13:51.590
So, in other words, when the
Callings save you from a fire,

13:51.630 --> 13:52.990
get ready for something bad
about to happen.

13:53.030 --> 13:56.700
Maybe the fire
was the bad thing.

13:56.730 --> 13:58.770
Have you ever
thought of that?

13:58.800 --> 14:01.700
I hope you're right.

14:01.740 --> 14:06.440
"And so began
our quest to...

14:06.470 --> 14:09.680
dispel our ailment...

14:09.710 --> 14:12.350
and cheat death
once again."

14:13.880 --> 14:16.580
Al-Zuras seemed to think he
could get rid of the Callings.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.390
So if we know
what happened to him,

14:18.420 --> 14:20.590
maybe we could figure it out
for ourselves.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.060
Where's my journal?
Where's my journal?

14:26.090 --> 14:28.000
Saanvi: Oh. Yes.
Journal.

14:28.030 --> 14:29.800
Yes, thank you.

14:29.830 --> 14:31.400
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.000
Okay, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you,

14:36.040 --> 14:37.640
thank you, thank you.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.710
How's Michaela?

14:42.740 --> 14:44.350
I bet she's like,
out-of-her-mind excited

14:44.380 --> 14:47.550
about the chance
to have you around for longer.

14:47.580 --> 14:50.620
Yeah.
She was.
We both were.

14:50.650 --> 14:54.990
But, Saanvi, I think we should
put a hold on the treatment.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.530
No, Zeke, look at me.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.390
Look at me.
I am fully functional.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.960
I haven't had a Calling
in weeks.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.370
I-I know -- I know that I am
a little bit supercharged,

15:06.400 --> 15:09.500
but that's gonna -- that's gonna
go away in about a day or two.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.410
You're getting worse.
You need a doctor.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.010
You know what I mean.
Maybe you missed the name tag.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.480
No! Stop!

15:16.510 --> 15:18.910
Okay.
Oh, my God. Ohh.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.720
Do you know what would happen
if they found out

15:20.750 --> 15:22.480
that I was testing
unapproved meds on myself?

15:22.520 --> 15:27.390
It would be my job, my chance
to save us from the Death Date.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.420
Where's my journal?

15:29.460 --> 15:31.660
Where's my journal?
Where's my journal?

15:35.630 --> 15:37.470
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.800
Mm-hmm?
Saanvi.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.840
We've had the same conversation
three times.

15:40.870 --> 15:42.500
I've been around the block
enough

15:42.540 --> 15:44.040
to know when people
are in trouble.

15:44.070 --> 15:45.640
Who can I call?

15:48.840 --> 15:50.580
Saanvi.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.810
There must be a doctor
you trust.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.050
Dr. Alex Bates.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.450
She's my ex.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.820
She's not taking my calls.
She doesn't want to talk to me.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.090
Then I'll go get her.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.390
Okay, she works at Boroughs.
I'll just go with you.

16:06.430 --> 16:07.830
I-I don't think
it's a great idea

16:07.860 --> 16:10.430
for you to be out
in this state.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.900
She's not gonna want to talk
to you about --

16:11.930 --> 16:15.540
Saanvi, this is important.
I'll figure it out.

16:15.570 --> 16:17.040
You sit tight.

16:17.070 --> 16:18.810
Don't let anyone in.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.740
Okay.
Okay.

16:25.910 --> 16:27.680
There seem to be an awful lot
of guesses

16:27.710 --> 16:29.080
and anonymous tips here.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.420
Individually, it wouldn't
raise an eyebrow,

16:31.450 --> 16:33.420
but in totality,
frankly, I'm troubled.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.820
All of those cases
stood up in court.

16:35.860 --> 16:38.560
Blanpied:
Maybe. Still...

16:38.590 --> 16:41.700
Let's talk more about the man
you live with, Ezekiel Landon.

16:41.730 --> 16:43.100
He has nothing
to do with this.

16:43.130 --> 16:45.600
And yet after
you and Landon connected,

16:45.630 --> 16:48.070
your knack for being in the
right place at the right time

16:48.100 --> 16:49.870
took a giant leap forward.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.140
You know what else
took a giant leap forward?

16:52.170 --> 16:53.710
The amount of second-guessing

16:53.740 --> 16:55.180
and outright betrayal
from my fellow officers.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.450
It's hard to have your
professional capabilities

16:57.480 --> 16:59.110
questioned,
to crave respect.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.550
I'm good at my job!

17:00.580 --> 17:02.880
You cut a few corners
to get ahead.

17:02.920 --> 17:07.220
But then did you and Landon
manufacture crimes

17:07.250 --> 17:08.760
in order to help
your career?

17:08.790 --> 17:10.460
Manufacture?! You --

17:10.490 --> 17:11.790
No, no, no, you cannot
be serious right now.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.090
You knew Isaiah McCann,

17:13.130 --> 17:14.830
manager of the nightclub
that burned down.

17:14.860 --> 17:16.460
Not socially. Yeah, he was
a victim in one of my --

17:16.500 --> 17:18.500
Witnesses and surveillance
put you at the club

17:18.530 --> 17:22.040
before the fire started,
talking to Isaiah McCann.

17:22.070 --> 17:23.600
He asked me to meet him.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.810
Now, I don't think that
you meant to kill anyone.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.070
Maybe you
underestimated things.

17:26.110 --> 17:28.710
Maybe the fires
got out of control.

17:28.740 --> 17:32.780
Tell me in your own words
what happened.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.020
I had nothing
to do with this.

17:37.050 --> 17:40.090
I would like my union rep.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.220
It feels like we're on the verge
of something.

17:42.260 --> 17:43.990
Why can't he remember
what he saw?

17:44.020 --> 17:46.190
You've seen how Cal
processes Callings.

17:46.230 --> 17:47.560
It's like his drawings.

17:47.590 --> 17:49.000
He's got something
in his head

17:49.030 --> 17:50.830
and he just can't
put it to words.

17:50.860 --> 17:52.200
The plane stuck
in a spider web?

17:52.230 --> 17:55.840
Is that a literal web
or Captain Daly's...

17:55.870 --> 17:58.910
dark lightning?

17:58.940 --> 18:00.740
Grace: Ben?

18:00.770 --> 18:03.940
You're getting that look
that you get.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.810
Take it easy.
He's just a kid.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.790
Yeah, okay.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.690
I just wish I understood
what he wants to build.

18:20.230 --> 18:25.930
Hey, did Cal say something
about a silver dragon?

18:25.970 --> 18:28.040
Art the dragon?

18:28.070 --> 18:29.740
This is different.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.540
TJ:
According to his journal,

18:31.570 --> 18:34.040
Al-Zuras had a recurring vision
about a silver dragon.

18:34.070 --> 18:36.810
"And on the dragon's wings
was borne despair

18:36.840 --> 18:39.010
and the makings
of our own demise."

18:39.050 --> 18:41.320
Cal's Calling,
the book...

18:42.850 --> 18:44.180
...it's got to be
connected.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.220
Well, everything's
connected, right?

18:46.250 --> 18:49.290
But still, spider webs,
silver dragons?

18:49.320 --> 18:50.660
It doesn't make any sense.

18:50.690 --> 18:51.960
Olive: Well, the Callings

18:51.990 --> 18:53.630
will never just come out
and say something.

18:53.660 --> 18:56.700
It's the point of a puzzle.
Got to figure it out.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.630
It's okay, Calamander.
It's getting worse!

19:00.670 --> 19:02.840
It's not okay!
It won't stop until we build it!

19:02.870 --> 19:04.940
The storm's outside.
We're safe in here.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.810
Storm?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.310
It's just a little weather.
Nothing to be afraid of.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.880
Yeah, buddy.

19:10.910 --> 19:12.780
Sorry, what are you guys
talking about?

19:14.980 --> 19:16.780
The rain.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.630
It's beautiful outside.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.670
65 and sunny.

19:38.710 --> 19:39.810
See?

19:40.840 --> 19:43.240
Oh, my God.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.080
The storm isn't real.

19:45.110 --> 19:48.750
It's a Calling.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.620
Something's coming.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.660
Okay, what the hell
is going on?

19:58.690 --> 20:00.160
Why am I hearing Michaela
called for a union rep?

20:00.190 --> 20:03.000
Apparently, Simon gave IA
those case files you stole.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.770
I thought you said you had
everything under control.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.800
That's when
it was about you.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.840
Clearly,
Simon called an audible,

20:08.870 --> 20:10.740
and now IA's digging
into everything.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.870
So, he -- he's just
gonna sacrifice me

20:12.910 --> 20:14.710
in order
to take Michaela down?

20:14.740 --> 20:16.210
Cap, this can blow up
in our faces,

20:16.240 --> 20:17.710
everything
we've worked for.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.280
If I were you,
I'd go have words with Simon

20:19.310 --> 20:21.220
and find out exactly
how much of a hole we're in.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.250
This is gonna hurt a lot more
people than just you and me

20:23.280 --> 20:24.650
if things go south.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.760
What does Al-Zuras say
about shared Callings?

20:34.800 --> 20:37.070
Not a lot.
Mass hallucinations?

20:37.100 --> 20:39.430
Although he did have a lot
to say about electrical storms.

20:39.470 --> 20:40.840
Yeah?

20:40.870 --> 20:43.040
So did Captain Daly.

20:43.070 --> 20:45.270
Did the captain describe
anything like this?

20:52.850 --> 20:55.120
The storm Calling has to
have something to do

20:55.150 --> 20:57.750
with what happened
on Flight 828.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.150
But why are we
getting it now,

20:59.190 --> 21:00.860
and what is it trying
to show us?

21:00.890 --> 21:02.790
"For every blessing,
a price must be paid."

21:02.820 --> 21:04.860
Would you stop it
already, please?

21:04.890 --> 21:07.330
Dad, he thinks the storm
is payback

21:07.360 --> 21:08.830
for all the good things
that have happened.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.430
Dad.
TJ, get over it!

21:10.470 --> 21:12.130
I'm sorry.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.800
It's just we've never had
a Calling like this before,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.370
one that lasted for
an extended period of time.

21:17.940 --> 21:19.770
And are we the only ones
seeing it?

21:19.810 --> 21:21.940
You guys find out what the storm
has to do with the book.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.950
And where are you going?
Keep me updated.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.380
Your brother thinks
building a spider web

21:25.410 --> 21:26.480
is the way out
of all this.

21:26.510 --> 21:27.980
I'm gonna help him.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.850
Mick, are you seeing
a storm?

21:29.880 --> 21:32.290
Give me a call back.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.890
Okay, is this

21:34.920 --> 21:36.360
close to what you're seeing
in your head?

21:36.390 --> 21:38.330
No! It's not right!
Take it off!

21:40.130 --> 21:41.460
It's okay, Cal.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.160
The storm isn't real,
remember?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.770
I said take it off!

21:44.800 --> 21:46.840
Okay!
Just watch your tone.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.170
Now look what
you made me do!

21:50.200 --> 21:51.770
Cal!

21:51.810 --> 21:54.010
Your mom's only trying to help.
We all are.

21:56.910 --> 21:59.080
I'm sorry. I-I don't know
what's going on here,

21:59.110 --> 22:01.880
but I already told Saanvi
I can't see her anymore.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.820
I know. I'm sorry.
It's too hard.

22:03.850 --> 22:07.260
Saanvi wanted to respect
your wishes, but this is --

22:07.290 --> 22:09.420
She doesn't, though.
She really needs your help.

22:09.460 --> 22:12.130
She just needs someone
to ask the right questions.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.330
This isn't about her research.
Her research is --

22:14.360 --> 22:16.530
Saanvi's in trouble
medically.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.030
She was working
on a treatment

22:18.070 --> 22:19.430
and -- and testing it
on herself.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.970
She didn't want me
to say anything, but --

22:21.000 --> 22:22.300
The blackouts.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.440
Last week she told me
she was forgetting things.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.340
I thought it might
be stress-related,

22:26.370 --> 22:27.480
told her to see someone.

22:27.510 --> 22:30.410
But she didn't, though,
did she?

22:30.440 --> 22:32.280
You're the only doctor
she trusts.

22:32.310 --> 22:35.150
Please.
I'm afraid for her life.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.490
You got nothing,
'cause if you did,

22:39.520 --> 22:41.860
we'd be having
a real different conversation.

22:41.890 --> 22:42.960
Why don't you tell us
what you think

22:42.990 --> 22:44.460
is going on,
Officer DiBacco?

22:44.490 --> 22:46.060
Whistleblower
retaliation.

22:46.090 --> 22:47.900
Vasquez is trying
to shut her up.

22:47.930 --> 22:50.330
Our questions about
Detective Stone's record

22:50.360 --> 22:52.530
have nothing to do
with Vasquez.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.500
So, those files just walked
themselves into your hand?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.070
Just zip it.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.540
Now, the two of you
are supposed to be

22:57.570 --> 22:59.270
the unbiased voice
of justice,

22:59.310 --> 23:01.510
not looking to take her down
because a passenger with a badge

23:01.540 --> 23:03.180
doesn't reflect well
on the department.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.410
Sir, we are trying
to understand

23:05.450 --> 23:07.050
what involvement
Detective Stone may have had

23:07.080 --> 23:08.280
in the nightclub fire.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.550
You want to know about
the fire? Fine.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.550
It was a trap set to kill me,
my family,

23:11.590 --> 23:13.460
Michaela.
and a slew of other --

23:16.160 --> 23:19.190
Why don't you tell us
how you knew it was a trap?

23:19.230 --> 23:20.930
You know,
if you keep talking,

23:20.960 --> 23:22.500
they're gonna hang you
with your own words.

23:22.530 --> 23:25.130
Detective Stone was a target
of the attack in question.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.840
It strains credulity that you
would try and pin it on her.

23:27.870 --> 23:29.270
When the fire started,

23:29.300 --> 23:31.310
you were one of the first people
out of that building.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.240
Because you knew
it would be safe?
I went back in to help.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.380
Because people were dying!
Because you wanted
to be a hero.

23:35.410 --> 23:37.380
DiBacco: That's enough!

23:37.410 --> 23:39.550
I need a moment to confer
with Detective Stone.

23:39.580 --> 23:43.220
My patience
is wearing thin.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.120
Come on,
we just gotta try again.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.990
Each time we build it,
we get a little closer.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.590
I've tried! I don't know
what it's supposed to be!

23:52.630 --> 23:55.060
Please, Cal,
can you just try again?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.200
I can't do it!
I can't!

24:11.680 --> 24:15.180
This was a Calling, okay?
It is not your fault.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.020
"For every good that comes,
a trial must follow."

24:18.050 --> 24:20.190
I was supposed to die
in that fire, Olive.

24:20.220 --> 24:22.890
Now everyone here has to suffer
because I didn't.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.460
TJ, the Callings saved you
for a reason, okay?

24:26.490 --> 24:28.030
We need you here.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.300
I need you here.

24:29.330 --> 24:31.470
Guys!
Where are you with the book?!

24:31.500 --> 24:34.270
Cal needs help. We got to
find a way to stop this.

24:45.580 --> 24:47.080
What does this say?

24:47.110 --> 24:49.020
That more bad things
are gonna happen.

24:49.050 --> 24:50.320
TJ!
What does this say?!

24:58.060 --> 25:03.500
"The cure begat
the affliction."

25:05.300 --> 25:06.700
According to this,

25:06.730 --> 25:10.100
some of Al-Zuras' men tried
to get rid of the Callings

25:10.140 --> 25:12.470
but ended up going mad.

25:12.510 --> 25:17.310
Some even threw themselves
overboard.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.450
I wonder why.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.070
Olive: Wait.

25:37.100 --> 25:41.100
Wait, wait, you guys are seeing
things that aren't there.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.340
Al-Zuras was a sailor,
right?

25:44.370 --> 25:48.110
Mom -- She's seasick.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.720
Cal losing his temper,

25:56.750 --> 26:00.560
TJ so upset, off-balance,
blaming himself.

26:00.590 --> 26:02.990
The storm.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.390
It's what happened to the men
on the boat.

26:08.530 --> 26:10.200
I think we're all
going mad.

26:17.510 --> 26:19.440
What are you thinking
coming here?

26:19.470 --> 26:21.540
Ben Stone's office
is just down the hall!

26:21.580 --> 26:23.280
The hell do I care?

26:23.310 --> 26:25.610
You get to blow up my job and
I got to stay clear of yours?

26:25.650 --> 26:28.120
This is not why I gave you
Michaela's case files.

26:29.180 --> 26:31.190
Really, Jared? What'd you
think was gonna happen?

26:31.220 --> 26:32.520
The plan was
to dump information

26:32.550 --> 26:34.190
about the 828 passengers
onto the Web,

26:34.220 --> 26:36.590
not to feed Mick's cases
to Internal Affairs, Simon!

26:36.620 --> 26:39.460
We have new information
about the passengers.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.260
Plans changed.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.700
You're concerned.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.040
I worked those cases
with her.

26:50.070 --> 26:52.470
An IA investigation
blows back on me.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.680
They're not looking at you for
the nightclub fire, are they?

26:54.710 --> 26:56.780
It doesn't matter.
She knows I took those files.

26:56.810 --> 26:59.750
Don't worry about it.
Now she's got plenty of ammo
to take me down.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.820
You know you have like-minded
friends at the NYPD.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.350
What are you
talking about?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.550
If Michaela Stone
goes on the offensive,

27:06.590 --> 27:10.090
your friends
will have your back.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.790
How are you gonna stop her
from talking?

27:14.130 --> 27:15.660
What happened
to nonviolence?

27:15.700 --> 27:18.630
Jared,
this isn't an ideology.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.300
It's a wake-up call.

27:20.330 --> 27:23.140
Did Michaela Stone ever talk
to you about telepathy?

27:26.110 --> 27:29.540
The 828 passengers are able
to see the future.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.750
Her brother's been keeping
quite copious records.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.250
That's news to me.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.550
For all we know,

27:34.580 --> 27:36.150
they're manipulating
the events around us,

27:36.180 --> 27:38.450
controlling us in ways
we don't even realize.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.320
It's everything
we've feared.

27:40.350 --> 27:42.320
But it's no longer
just a theory.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.830
It's a fact.

27:43.860 --> 27:46.290
And now that one of them
is coming right at us?

27:46.330 --> 27:50.260
Michaela Stone
is a threat.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.300
We'll do
what needs to be done.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.880
This is so wrong.
This entire inquiry's driven

27:59.910 --> 28:01.640
by circumstantial evidence
and anti-828 bias.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.110
You've been on the other side
of this table plenty of times.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.320
They're baiting you,
waiting for you to trip up.

28:06.350 --> 28:08.520
This was supposed to be
about Jared and the Xers.

28:08.550 --> 28:10.420
Well, forget about Vasquez.
Save yourself.

28:10.450 --> 28:12.550
From what, a conspiracy theory
that I burnt these people down?

28:12.590 --> 28:14.190
That's crap.
They know it.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.560
People have questions,
okay?

28:16.590 --> 28:18.730
You make a good fall guy.
Don't help them.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.300
Thank you for that.

28:20.330 --> 28:23.200
Oh, and, uh, simple answers --
yes or no.

28:23.230 --> 28:25.400
And for God's sakes,
when I tell you not to answer,

28:25.430 --> 28:26.870
shut the hell up.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.320
Blanpied:
Let's back things up a little.

28:42.350 --> 28:44.550
You first met the alleged
nightclub arsonist,

28:44.590 --> 28:46.590
Isaiah McCann, when he was
arrested for the murder

28:46.620 --> 28:48.490
Yes.
of another passenger --
Kelly Taylor.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.560
And your investigation
exonerated him.

28:50.590 --> 28:52.930
Mm-hmm, because he didn't do it
and we caught the killer.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.400
With one of your many
coincidental solves.

28:55.430 --> 28:58.370
McCann knew your niece,
Olive Stone.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.270
They were members
of the same cult.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.800
Olive is the one who identified
Mr. McCann's attackers

29:02.840 --> 29:04.440
at the church,
am I right?

29:06.410 --> 29:09.440
Your niece must really
look up to you.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.850
Her cool aunt,
a Flight 828 survivor,

29:12.880 --> 29:14.650
a successful detective.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.750
She'd probably
do anything you asked.

29:16.790 --> 29:19.450
Olive Stone's statement in
the assault case checked out.
No, that is --

29:19.490 --> 29:21.660
Your brother, Ben Stone,

29:21.690 --> 29:25.460
he was involved in a number of
your cases, as well, wasn't he?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.600
What were you
thinking?

29:29.630 --> 29:31.530
If I'd known what I was
helping you with...

29:31.570 --> 29:33.570
I know that.
That's why I didn't tell you.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.570
I miss you.
I miss --

29:35.600 --> 29:37.740
Saanvi. I can't.

29:42.910 --> 29:44.680
Make a fist.

29:46.510 --> 29:48.920
You know
how reckless this is.

29:48.950 --> 29:50.920
Why do this to yourself?

29:52.420 --> 29:54.220
She was trying
to help me.

29:56.690 --> 29:58.760
Always looking out
for other people

29:58.790 --> 30:00.530
at the expense
of yourself.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.360
Help you what?

30:02.400 --> 30:03.930
Not die.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.730
You know the people
on Flight 828, they ha--

30:05.770 --> 30:07.470
Saanvi.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.470
I thought he wasn't
on Flight 828.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.410
Yeah.
The thing is, uh --

30:12.910 --> 30:15.510
Your dopamine levels
are off the charts.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.310
We need to get this
under control.

30:17.350 --> 30:18.880
Then you need to explain.

30:23.050 --> 30:24.820
Did I say too much?

30:26.590 --> 30:29.830
Saanvi, I know that look,
but this thing with Alex --

30:29.860 --> 30:34.960
I just feel like the universe
wants us to be together.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.470
Yeah. I get it.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.300
But you're not in any shape
to be talking about --

30:41.340 --> 30:42.570
Let's see your arm.

30:45.370 --> 30:46.740
What are you giving her?

30:46.780 --> 30:51.350
A dopamine antagonist
that's helpful in psych cases.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.980
It should stabilize her
and hopefully slow down

30:54.020 --> 30:56.550
whatever's got her
running on overdrive.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.700
Sleep well, Vi.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.700
What do we do now?

31:15.740 --> 31:17.070
Now we wait...

31:17.110 --> 31:20.010
and hope she doesn't need
to go to the ER.

31:24.850 --> 31:27.480
You had motive
and opportunity.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.580
This can't be all
just one big coincidence.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.320
No, it's a smokescreen,
and you're falling for it.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.420
Michaela.
Jared Vasquez is an Xer.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.890
Blanpied: You and your family
had to know

31:36.930 --> 31:38.330
that sooner or later it was
going to catch up with you.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.800
You can't honestly think
that my family

31:39.830 --> 31:41.060
had anything
to do with this!

31:41.100 --> 31:42.760
We'll know when we get
their statements.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.930
Jared is
the criminal here!

31:43.970 --> 31:45.600
You have the damn
surveillance!

31:45.630 --> 31:47.600
The surveillance you provided
is inconclusive.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.100
A guy is allowed
an off-duty drink.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.970
Michaela:
This isn't just any bar!

31:51.010 --> 31:54.110
If you can prove Vasquez
is guilty of actual crimes,

31:54.140 --> 31:55.710
we're all ears.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.650
DiBacco: This is your badge
we're talking about.

31:57.680 --> 31:58.850
Don't take the bait.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.350
They don't care
about the truth.

32:00.380 --> 32:01.580
They're gonna
run me for it anyways.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.350
Look, Jared brought this
on himself.

32:03.390 --> 32:04.820
He brings a threat
to my family.

32:04.850 --> 32:07.560
You don't think
I'm gonna fight back?

32:07.590 --> 32:09.630
What do you want to know?
I'll tell you anything.

32:13.700 --> 32:16.000
Before we proceed, we need to
make clear that in no way

32:16.030 --> 32:17.700
is this an offer of leniency

32:17.730 --> 32:19.600
in exchange for your informing
on another officer.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.100
Whistleblowing
doesn't give you immunity.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.400
Okay, fine.
I understand.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.010
No, you don't understand!

32:24.040 --> 32:26.740
Okay, we need to take this
to a neutral location and now.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.480
On the grounds
On what grounds?

32:28.510 --> 32:30.380
that you're railroading this
detective in her own house!

32:30.410 --> 32:32.910
She didn't do anything wrong,
but other people here did.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.650
And, frankly,
the walls have ears.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.520
That doesn't seem to be
a problem for her thus far.

32:36.550 --> 32:39.860
That's before we were talking
about career suicide!

32:39.890 --> 32:41.720
On top of which,
now she's being pressured

32:41.760 --> 32:43.560
to implicate another member
of my union.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.690
I'm gonna need to confer
with my own superior.

32:45.730 --> 32:48.730
If this is some sort
of stalling tactic --

32:48.760 --> 32:52.400
Or we can stay here, my friend,
and I can file an appeal

32:52.430 --> 32:55.000
on the basis of coercion
and intimidation.

32:57.770 --> 33:01.680
We'll reserve a conference room
downtown.

33:01.710 --> 33:03.110
You have one hour.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.800
It doesn't work!
It's never gonna work!

33:23.830 --> 33:25.470
Cal, you have to
calm down!

33:25.500 --> 33:27.940
This Calling is making everyone
crazy, me included.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.600
Al-Zuras went through
the same thing.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.910
It's the storm.

33:30.940 --> 33:32.710
But we have to find a way
to make it stop.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.080
Yes, you can!
I can't!

33:34.110 --> 33:35.940
We're here to help!

33:35.980 --> 33:37.780
Cal, come back.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.030
I have to!
Olive: Please, don't leave!

33:52.060 --> 33:55.030
Why won't you just tell me
what the book is saying?!

33:55.060 --> 33:57.130
TJ: This storm
is because of me!

33:57.170 --> 33:59.530
If I leave,
maybe you'll all be safe!

33:59.570 --> 34:01.570
The storm isn't real!

34:01.600 --> 34:05.040
To you! Don't you see what
it's doing to everyone else?!

34:05.070 --> 34:08.540
TJ, you cannot run out
on a Calling! It won't work!

34:08.580 --> 34:10.680
For all we know, you go
out there, you could
get yourself killed.

34:10.710 --> 34:12.180
Well, I'm supposed to
be dead already!

34:12.210 --> 34:15.080
You're supposed to be
right where you are -- here.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.620
What does the book say?

34:16.650 --> 34:18.190
That the Callings
won't stop.

34:18.220 --> 34:20.160
Ever.
Now, just let me go.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.590
No! No!

34:21.620 --> 34:22.990
Every Calling
needs to be solved.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.030
Now, you had the Calling,
which means you can help.

34:25.060 --> 34:26.930
TJ, whatever
is going on in here,

34:26.960 --> 34:30.070
whatever is going on out there,
it is all connected.

34:52.050 --> 34:53.590
Lightning.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.560
The book.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.500
The book.
The book.

35:04.230 --> 35:06.600
It's got to be here.

35:06.630 --> 35:09.540
Where is it?

35:09.570 --> 35:11.670
I saw this exact lightning bolt
outside just now.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.070
TJ: Yeah, I did, too.

35:13.110 --> 35:14.640
What do you think
it means?

35:20.320 --> 35:22.850
Did you see that?

35:22.880 --> 35:24.690
See what?

35:26.890 --> 35:28.720
Right there.

35:30.930 --> 35:32.260
A spider web.

35:34.260 --> 35:36.600
I think I know what Cal's
trying to build.

35:51.510 --> 35:53.320
Out of my hands now.

35:53.350 --> 35:56.190
She's gonna give the rest
of her testimony down at OnePP.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.230
Nice seeing you.
Be in touch.

36:04.260 --> 36:06.000
Very good.

36:06.030 --> 36:08.730
She's not gonna
make it downtown.

36:13.770 --> 36:16.510
Michaela Stone,
you're under arrest for arson,

36:16.540 --> 36:18.980
conspiracy to commit arson,
and homicide.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.240
Are you out of your mind
right now?

36:22.280 --> 36:24.280
Captain, what is --
Please put your hands
on the desk.

36:24.310 --> 36:26.580
Excuse me!
Detective Vasquez,
what do you think you're doing?

36:26.620 --> 36:28.620
It's called police work.
I'm arresting my suspect.

36:28.650 --> 36:30.350
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:30.390 --> 36:32.150
Are you seriously trying to
handcuff me in our own precinct?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.560
Fong: Detective,
your colleague's a subject

36:33.590 --> 36:36.190
in an active Internal Affairs
investigation.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.590
You can take your procedure
and shove it right up your ass.
According to procedure --

36:38.630 --> 36:41.060
Detective Stone's in custody.
She's not going anywhere.

36:41.100 --> 36:42.770
You have the right
to remain silent.
Think about what you're doing
right now!

36:42.800 --> 36:44.370
Anything you say can
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.600
You are never gonna
live this down, Jared!

36:45.630 --> 36:46.800
You have the right
to an attorney.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.170
If you cannot hire
an attorney...

36:58.510 --> 37:02.120
Alex?
What are you doing here?

37:03.290 --> 37:05.320
You needed me.

37:05.350 --> 37:08.190
Um, I did?
I'm -- I'm sorry.

37:08.220 --> 37:10.760
I know I promised
I wouldn't call.

37:10.790 --> 37:14.460
Saanvi, if -- if you're
in some sort of trouble

37:14.500 --> 37:18.370
or i-if there's something
about Flight 828, I --

37:18.400 --> 37:19.800
No, I'm --

37:22.270 --> 37:23.610
I'm so sorry.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.210
It is...

37:25.240 --> 37:28.680
incredibly unfair for me
to have drawn you into this.

37:28.710 --> 37:30.510
Dangerous, even.

37:32.310 --> 37:35.120
Go back to your family.

37:35.150 --> 37:38.620
Forget about this.
Forget about me.

37:38.650 --> 37:41.460
Never.

37:41.490 --> 37:44.860
Not even if you up
and vanished into thin air.

37:47.230 --> 37:49.330
Yeah,
that would be a feat.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.810
Please be safe.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.740
The world needs you.

38:13.290 --> 38:14.660
Thank you.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.680
Is this what you saw?

38:33.710 --> 38:35.410
Uh, more spread out.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.680
Tie it up there.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.820
Yeah, like that.

38:42.850 --> 38:44.750
I really don't get what
you're trying to prove here.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.390
There's no way out.
It says right here on the page!

38:47.420 --> 38:49.660
"In the end, there is no way
to be rid of the Voice.

38:49.690 --> 38:51.630
The only way to survive
is to accept."

38:51.660 --> 38:52.900
Accept what?

38:52.930 --> 38:54.860
That we have to live
like this forever?

39:02.940 --> 39:04.910
That it's all connected!

39:25.360 --> 39:27.560
The silver dragon.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.850
Um...
What just happened?

39:48.880 --> 39:51.190
It is all connected.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.560
Grace:
What was that in the sky?

39:54.590 --> 39:56.860
Was that...Flight 828?

39:56.890 --> 39:58.960
Buddy,
is that what you saw?

39:58.990 --> 40:00.760
I think so.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.630
Is it possible?

40:02.660 --> 40:05.770
Were Al-Zuras' ship
and Flight 828

40:05.800 --> 40:08.840
somehow in the same place
at the same time?

40:08.870 --> 40:11.240
The same storm?

40:11.270 --> 40:12.580
How?

40:16.980 --> 40:19.350
What does it mean for us?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.250
Hey.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.590
Oh. Hey.

40:25.620 --> 40:29.590
I wanted to say thank you for
not giving up on me back there.

40:29.620 --> 40:31.630
I sort of lost my mind.

40:31.660 --> 40:33.930
Yeah, we all did.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.760
It was the Calling.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.670
But thankfully,
you were here,

40:37.700 --> 40:39.740
and we had all the right pieces
to solve it.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.470
TJ, thanks to you,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.410
I think we just learned
how to beat the Death Date.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.940
How so?

40:44.970 --> 40:48.780
Here.
You translated it yourself.

40:48.810 --> 40:51.550
"There is no way
to be rid of the Voice.

40:51.580 --> 40:56.620
The only way to survive
is to accept."

40:56.650 --> 40:58.290
Accept the Voice?

40:58.320 --> 40:59.590
The Callings.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.860
Now, he's telling us
following the Callings

41:01.890 --> 41:03.890
is the only way
we have a chance.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.430
He's telling you
more than just that.

41:07.460 --> 41:09.300
Keep reading.

41:09.330 --> 41:12.870
"All other paths
lead to disaster."

41:14.370 --> 41:16.440
"All other paths."

41:19.870 --> 41:21.380
Saanvi.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.080
We're so close.

41:25.110 --> 41:27.780
I just need
a little bit more time.

41:27.820 --> 41:31.520
Saanvi, you've already done so
much, put yourself in danger --

41:31.550 --> 41:32.990
I'm not gonna stop.

41:33.020 --> 41:37.090
I refuse to let the Callings
control our lives, okay?

41:37.130 --> 41:39.930
We're gonna beat this
Death Date, no matter what.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.900
Her research,
her self-medicating.

41:54.710 --> 41:56.110
You know damn well
I didn't start that fire.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.650
You're being vindictive.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.350
I don't care if I burn
this entire precinct down.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.350
I will out you for every
remotely questionable thing

42:01.380 --> 42:03.850
Mick, shut up?!
you've ever done!

42:06.090 --> 42:08.590
You have to
keep your mouth shut.

42:08.620 --> 42:10.030
I just saved your life.
