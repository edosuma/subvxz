00:00.001 --> 00:01.717
<i> Previously on</i> scorpion...
Cabe, you need a place to crash

00:01.718 --> 00:03.434
for a couple weeks, right?

00:03.437 --> 00:07.006
As of now, happy's apartment
has a vacancy.

00:07.008 --> 00:10.709
He's been alone for 20 years.
He's desperate for company.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.212
Last night, we played
cribbage until midnight.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.614
This is my campaign manager,
Allie Jones.

00:15.616 --> 00:19.385
My name is Gabe, cabe.
Cabe, cabe gallo.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.652
Why don't you ask her out?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.254
She's at least ten years
younger than me.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.156
Everyone's at least ten years
younger than you.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.025
As gross as it sounds,
she's warm for your form.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.494
Walter, cut the crap.
You're still in love with Paige.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.762
I never liked you

00:29.764 --> 00:32.031
because you never
made me feel welcome.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.333
You will never be
a real member of scorpion.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.768
Um...

00:37.605 --> 00:40.039
Take the job
your friend offered.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.573
No, it's-it's
in the middle east.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.142
This is not necessary.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.210
Walter,
you didn't drive me away.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.513
I made this choice on my own.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.389
Man, it is hotter than
a jalapeno's armpit out there...

00:59.160 --> 01:01.126
Walter: Come on, Toby,
sweep that broom!

01:01.128 --> 01:04.596
No way! It's going too straight!
I call shmockery!

01:04.598 --> 01:06.598
Nope. No sham. No mockery.
Just bristles coated

01:06.600 --> 01:08.200
in an ice-melting bacteria

01:08.202 --> 01:10.135
I cultivated myself.
Violation.

01:10.137 --> 01:12.604
You ever see the movie
<i> Gus</i> about the field
goal-kicking mule?

01:12.606 --> 01:14.073
If the rules books don't
explicitly forbid it,

01:14.075 --> 01:15.374
anything is legal.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.177
Now, look at this.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.344
Hoo!

01:19.346 --> 01:20.813
Winner, winner,
fermented fish dinner.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.216
Mm-mm.
Cabe: Shouldn't you guys
be prepping

01:24.218 --> 01:25.985
for today's job?

01:25.986 --> 01:27.753
Already have. The interstate
waterway will be tested

01:27.755 --> 01:29.755
and cleared for use by sundown.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.274
Turbine will have
enough thrust to push

01:32.275 --> 01:34.792
the waters through the pipeline
from spokane to San Diego.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.763
All this talk of pipes made
us realize that by running

01:37.765 --> 01:39.531
chilled calcium chloride
through copper tubing

01:39.533 --> 01:41.533
underneath a small pool
of water,

01:41.535 --> 01:45.104
we could create a curling pond.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.172
You guys are distracted
too easily.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.241
Hazard of busy minds. Batter up.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.743
Walter: W-wait.
Huh? What is that?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.879
Little device I whipped up.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.148
Dial in a few bits of data,

01:56.150 --> 01:57.416
and...
(Beeping)

01:57.418 --> 01:59.485
(Mechanical whirring)

02:03.891 --> 02:05.624
No brooming necessary.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.360
What are you so smug about?
Machine did all the work.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.163
Yup. And I built the machine.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.798
Phooey. Dingo's.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.233
What happened to winchell's?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.467
Tim lived next to winchell's.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.336
Now Tim's on his way
to the middle east,

02:17.338 --> 02:18.470
so we're back
to dingo's.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.272
How do you screw up a donut?

02:20.274 --> 02:23.208
You know, Tim's departure
doesn't only affect snacks.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.678
I ran some numbers, and he was
integral to 29% of our cases.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.180
No small loss.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.214
Not really.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.516
Well, I'm not
saying that

02:30.518 --> 02:32.417
for any personal reason.
It's just a fact.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.186
Everyone on scorpion
is replaceable.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.921
There are other
top mathematicians,

02:35.923 --> 02:37.823
behaviorists, engineers.

02:37.825 --> 02:41.360
We could find a younger
and stronger federal agent.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.262
A-and, truth be told,

02:43.264 --> 02:44.663
there are three people
with higher iqs than mine--

02:44.665 --> 02:45.898
four, including Ralph.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.267
So, my point is that we are all

02:48.269 --> 02:50.836
substitutable parts
of a machine.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.271
(Door opens)

02:52.273 --> 02:54.573
Great pep talk, coach.
(Door closes)

02:54.575 --> 02:56.775
Paige:
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Tim's flight was delayed,

02:56.777 --> 02:59.811
so I spent a little time
with him at the airport.
No problem, kiddo.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.812
You okay?

03:00.814 --> 03:01.914
Me? Sure. Of course.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.852
(Whispers):
She's not okay.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.621
(Grunts)

03:09.623 --> 03:12.791
Toby: All right.
What do you got, cabe?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.259
All right...

03:14.261 --> 03:16.795
Uh, so Tim got off all right?

03:16.797 --> 03:18.297
Other than the flight
delay, of course?

03:18.299 --> 03:19.831
Yup.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.234
Well, there are numerous factors
that affect the accuracy

03:22.236 --> 03:23.702
of airline departures...

03:23.704 --> 03:25.204
I'm sure there are,
but we should really get

03:25.206 --> 03:26.572
the team going. It's a...

03:26.574 --> 03:28.240
Long way to the desert.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.342
Of course. Work.
Yeah. Well, I'm glad to hear

03:30.344 --> 03:33.278
everything's back to normal.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.414
Back to normal?
Uh...

03:35.416 --> 03:37.983
How exactly do you feel
everything's "back to normal"?

03:37.985 --> 03:41.787
Well, scorpion is back
to the original roster,

03:41.789 --> 03:44.289
and we have a-a case to handle,
and Tim leaving,

03:44.291 --> 03:46.625
as he told me, was his decision.
So, I calculated

03:46.627 --> 03:49.661
that you wouldn't
be angry at me...

03:50.831 --> 03:53.765
My calculations were off,
weren't they?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.567
Just a bit.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.502
But Tim told me he wanted to go.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.004
Tim said what he had to say

03:59.006 --> 04:01.873
because of an uncomfortable
situation you created.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.809
You effectively
forced him out.

04:03.811 --> 04:07.379
So, with respect to things
between you and me,

04:07.381 --> 04:09.348
things are definitely
not back to normal.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.416
(Footsteps moving away)

04:13.787 --> 04:16.855
Just got a call
from my contractor.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.824
My house is officially
mold-free.

04:18.826 --> 04:19.958
So you get your couch back,

04:19.960 --> 04:22.361
and I'm finally
out of your hair.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.296
Oh.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.998
Okay.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.002
We're still, uh, in the middle
of that game of stratego.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.704
Yeah, I know. I figure
i can come by one night,

04:32.706 --> 04:33.839
we can finish it up.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.674
Sure.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.943
Great.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.480
Um...

04:41.482 --> 04:43.548
I, uh...

04:45.352 --> 04:46.985
This belonged to my mother.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.322
She wore it on her wedding day.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.357
And there's that
tradition: Something old,

04:52.359 --> 04:53.825
new, borrowed, blue.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.794
Thought,
when you married the doc,

04:55.796 --> 04:58.030
that if you wanted,
you could wear it.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.965
It's okay if you don't want to.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.367
I love it.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.770
Thank you.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.872
Just a little something
for lettin' me shack up with ya.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.777
Speaking of shacking up,

05:11.779 --> 05:13.879
isn't that the cutie
that's hot for your Booty?

05:13.881 --> 05:16.848
Oh, man, I'm starting
to sound like Toby.

05:16.850 --> 05:17.916
(Whispers):
How do I look?

05:22.056 --> 05:24.423
Allie. (Chuckling):
How you doing?

05:24.425 --> 05:25.991
Good. Thanks.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.026
I-I'm so sorry
to bother you at work...

05:28.028 --> 05:30.629
Ah, it's-it's no bother.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.698
I just wanted
to drop off the guidelines

05:32.700 --> 05:34.833
for the upcoming debate
between Mr. patel and Sylvester.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.068
You can review them.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.502
Oh, that's not necessary.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.970
If you say they're fair,
they're fair.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.939
Oh, okay. Um...

05:40.941 --> 05:43.442
I thought we'd have it
at the elk's lodge?

05:43.444 --> 05:46.011
Oh, that one near
the new Italian place?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.079
Yeah, yeah! That's the one.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.783
In fact, I've been wanting
to check it out.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.753
I hear they have
a fantastic vegetable lasagna.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.954
Oh, I love Italian food.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.889
With a last name like gallo,
how could I not?

05:57.891 --> 06:00.625
(Both chuckle)

06:00.627 --> 06:02.894
Yeah...

06:02.896 --> 06:05.897
Oh, okay. Um...

06:05.899 --> 06:07.899
Well, I'll see you soon.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.035
Have a good time today.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.713
"Have a good time today."

06:21.715 --> 06:24.850
Good time at what? What
the hell does that mean?

06:24.852 --> 06:27.819
I don't know. I-i got nervous.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.621
She was begging you to take her
to that Italian joint.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.457
No. Pretty sure that was...

06:32.459 --> 06:34.393
Just a conversation
between two adults.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.395
Paige:
All right, adults, let's hit it.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.396
Cabe, she wanted you to ask
her out. You suck at girls.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.066
(Door opens)

06:43.404 --> 06:45.103
♪ ♪

06:52.012 --> 06:54.613
Look at all that hardware.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.981
Sweet.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.682
Toby: Cold Northwestern water
traveling

06:57.684 --> 07:01.086
1,400 miles underground
to drought-ravaged southland.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.954
Government finally
got one right.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.056
Speaking of "cold travels,"

07:05.058 --> 07:07.692
Paige didn't say a word
the entire drive out here.

07:07.694 --> 07:08.860
She's pissed.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.896
Yes. I'm aware.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.931
Can I please plug my fan
into one of your dashboards?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.934
I got an extension cord
so I can share the breeze.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.004
A fan? No way.
Victorian ladies fan themselves.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.072
It's 110 degrees out here.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.141
When your sweat evaporates,
it cools the skin

07:23.143 --> 07:25.110
by naturally taking the heat
with it.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.579
Yeah. Along with your manhood.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.114
Okay. So, we need to run
a full diagnostic

07:29.116 --> 07:31.983
before the contractors come back
on Monday, so, happy,

07:31.985 --> 07:34.219
run a line from the water truck
to the pipe intake.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.954
We need to prime
the pump and run the turbine.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.689
I'll calculate
the energy output.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.157
I'll record
solar panel function.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.926
And as the federal agent
assigned

07:40.928 --> 07:42.527
to oversee this federal job,

07:42.529 --> 07:44.596
I will observe from this chair,

07:44.598 --> 07:45.964
with my eyes closed,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.900
while I enjoy iced coffee
in the sunshine.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.636
Paige? Do you want
to help record

07:51.638 --> 07:53.905
my observations of the turbine
when in operation?

07:53.907 --> 07:56.174
Sure.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.909
Cabe:
Middle of the desert,

07:57.911 --> 08:00.145
and I still felt
that cold front.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.647
Oh, you're not helping at all.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.486
(Whirring)
Water pressure fluctuation's

08:07.488 --> 08:10.555
at less than
five percent variable.

08:10.557 --> 08:11.590
Copy that.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.092
Coil resistance is stable.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.861
Check.
Energy output

08:15.863 --> 08:17.562
is a-above normal.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.147
Hmm.

08:19.148 --> 08:20.731
Well, that's because
the temperature's running hot.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.567
Actually, very hot.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.836
Walter:
Uh, happy? Come check this out.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.738
Copy that.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.909
Hey, there's a bigger draw on
that solar panel than expected.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.077
It's 'cause the
turbine's running hot.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.545
Happy:
What's up?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.280
Turbine's hot.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.582
So are you, by the way.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.251
Love that rubber boot,
mechanic outfit combo.

08:39.253 --> 08:40.919
Happy:
Let me guess.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.787
Save it for the honeymoon.
If you could.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.625
Uh, there's your problem
right there.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.894
The rotor's coated in copper.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.029
Government specs
don't mention that.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.030
Copper in this heat

08:52.032 --> 08:54.132
gets a lot hotter than an alloy.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.667
It's warping the pins.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.068
It's getting louder, too.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.321
Okay, I'm gonna shut it down

08:59.322 --> 09:01.573
so happy can check each piece,
just to be safe.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.041
Hey!

09:03.043 --> 09:05.143
How am I supposed to get
any sleep out there

09:05.145 --> 09:06.077
with all this high-pitch noise?

09:06.079 --> 09:08.146
(Explosion, clanging)

09:08.148 --> 09:11.016
Oh, that sucker exploded.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.751
Looks like a shard
of copper snapped off

09:12.753 --> 09:14.319
in the velocity and friction.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.921
We'll have to find it
if we're gonna fix it.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.055
Sylvester:
Where is it?
Um...

09:17.057 --> 09:20.325
Guys?
(Grunts)

09:20.327 --> 09:21.927
Cabe?
Paige: Cabe?

09:21.929 --> 09:24.296
Sylvester: Cabe! You okay?
Happy: Cabe? Oh, my god.

09:24.298 --> 09:26.898
♪ ♪

09:38.845 --> 09:40.912
No! That's too long!
He's bleeding from his stomach.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.647
Tell 'em a small
piece of shrapnel

09:42.649 --> 09:44.132
sliced his abdominal aorta

09:44.133 --> 09:45.616
and he's bleeding out!
Did you hear that?

09:45.619 --> 09:47.102
Get here now!

09:47.103 --> 09:48.586
Sylvester:
Set him down gently, gently.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.622
Toby:
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.890
Cabe, listen to me.
Can you understand me?

09:52.793 --> 09:55.360
I feel dizzy.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.797
Cabe, I'm gonna have
to slow your blood loss,
so I got to do something

09:58.799 --> 10:00.298
that's a little personal
and a lot of gross.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.133
I'm gonna stick
my fingers inside your wound

10:02.135 --> 10:03.134
to find the bleed,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.669
and then remove the shrapnel.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.938
Oh, boy.
(Cries out)

10:06.940 --> 10:08.673
Oh!

10:08.675 --> 10:10.308
(Cabe yells)

10:10.310 --> 10:12.043
You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!

10:12.045 --> 10:15.080
If I don't find the bleed,
he's gonna die in seconds.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.050
God!
(Cabe continues yelling)

10:19.052 --> 10:20.952
Okay...

10:20.954 --> 10:23.855
And here is the culprit.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.056
Oh, okay.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.058
I got to find the cut.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.994
Got to be in there somewhere.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.730
Oh, I got it!
Oh, man!

10:31.732 --> 10:33.231
That's cut clean through.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.066
Um... happy,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.801
give me that binder clip
that's on the government specs.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.371
Oh, man, this should work.

10:39.373 --> 10:42.907
That's not sterile.
Sly, I'm wearing cabe
on my hand like a puppet.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.909
Sterile was gone
a long time ago.

10:44.911 --> 10:45.877
(Groaning)

10:45.879 --> 10:47.779
I've almost got the clamp on,

10:47.781 --> 10:50.815
but that aorta is pumping strong

10:50.817 --> 10:52.250
and it's hard to control.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.719
And I have...

10:54.721 --> 10:55.820
Got it on.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.689
Oh!
Paige:
Bleeding stopped?

10:57.691 --> 11:00.825
He's okay?
He's stabilized, but that clip
isn't gonna hold long.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.828
When's the help get here?
Lancaster scrambled a chopper,

11:03.830 --> 11:04.996
but it's 250 miles away
and they said it only goes

11:04.998 --> 11:06.915
150 miles per hour.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.833
90 minutes to get up here, 90
minutes to get back down there.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.803
That's three hours before cabe
even sees an operating room!

11:11.805 --> 11:14.305
His artery's still oozing.
He doesn't have three hours.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.708
(Weakly):
Walter...

11:16.710 --> 11:18.143
Yes?

11:18.145 --> 11:19.878
Help me.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.888
Okay, okay, okay, okay, so

11:29.890 --> 11:31.456
let's break this down logically.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.023
The blood is being forced
out of the binder clip because

11:33.026 --> 11:35.360
the heart is pumping out blood
from the cut artery,

11:35.362 --> 11:38.296
(mumbling):
So we need, we need...

11:38.298 --> 11:41.933
We need to stop
the heart from beating.
They taught us at Harvard

11:41.935 --> 11:44.402
that stopping the heart is
actually bad for the patient.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.870
Something about
the brain needing oxygen.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.039
What if the brain doesn't need
any oxygen?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.340
What if we bring

11:49.342 --> 11:51.209
his body temperature down so low

11:51.211 --> 11:52.777
that it slows
his metabolism down

11:52.779 --> 11:54.145
so he's not using any oxygen?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.847
Suspended animation?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.982
That's a long shot.
Well, take it from a gambler,

11:57.984 --> 11:59.217
sometimes a long shot's all you
have to bet on.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.335
We're in the middle
of the desert.

12:00.336 --> 12:01.452
How do we get
the body temperature low

12:01.455 --> 12:02.454
when it's a million degrees out?

12:02.456 --> 12:04.789
Guys, he's shaking.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.392
He's in shock. Guys, we have to
figure this out like yesterday!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.060
Sly's stupid fan!

12:09.062 --> 12:10.462
What about it?
Evaporation!

12:10.464 --> 12:12.464
I can use the water tanker's
intake manifold

12:12.466 --> 12:14.399
to create a super-cooling
evaporation vacuum.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.000
What the hell does
that even mean?

12:16.002 --> 12:17.802
It means we're gonna make him
an ice bath.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.137
It would have to go down
to 58 degrees.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.238
Can you get it that low?
It'll be tight,

12:20.240 --> 12:21.506
but I think I can pull it off.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.773
Okay, so happy freezes cabe,

12:22.776 --> 12:24.009
which will stop his heart.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.243
The next step is
repairing his aorta.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.145
I'm a shrink; Last time
i did vascular surgery

12:27.147 --> 12:29.147
was in med school.
That was on a cadaver.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.215
There's no way to keep
cabe's temperature down

12:30.217 --> 12:32.000
on the helicopter.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.784
He'll have to be warmed up
within the next 90 minutes.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.487
And we can't warm him up if his
aorta's still torn.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.088
He'll just bleed out again.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.957
Walt's right, it has to be
repaired while

12:38.959 --> 12:40.125
he's still frozen.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.161
Doc...

12:43.163 --> 12:45.497
You can do it.

12:45.499 --> 12:48.066
You're damn right, I can.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.901
You were in my corner when
you taught me how to box.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.170
I'm gonna be in your corner now.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.404
Okay, first thing I'm gonna need
is super glue

12:53.406 --> 12:54.506
to hold the artery together.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.241
Gasoline and styrofoam
will get you

12:56.243 --> 12:57.175
a really strong adhesive.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.243
Do you have styrofoam?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.911
No, but the polymer in styrofoam

12:59.913 --> 13:01.146
is in polystyrene
and I have that

13:01.148 --> 13:03.114
in the packing foam
of my hand drill.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.016
Next thing I'm gonna need
is an elemental

13:05.018 --> 13:07.552
reducing agent, something
like hydrogen sulfur gas.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.121
For what?
Well, we can't just reheat cabe
like a frozen dinner.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.991
Shock like that'll damage his
heart so badly, it'll kill him.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.793
The hydrogen sulfur
will protect his major organs

13:14.795 --> 13:16.361
when awakening
from a traumatic state.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.296
This is a geologically active
area; 20 miles away,

13:18.298 --> 13:19.998
there are sulfur hot Springs
that I saw

13:20.000 --> 13:21.299
when I was mapping out
the route.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.417
Toby:
That'll give us what we need.

13:22.418 --> 13:23.534
Paige:
Cabe, we're gonna pull this off.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.270
But you need to
stay strong, okay?

13:25.272 --> 13:26.605
Okay.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.939
Toby:
The last thing I'm gonna need

13:27.941 --> 13:29.307
is a blood thinner.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.110
When cabe's heart stops,
his blood is gonna clot.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.962
When we rev him back up,

13:33.963 --> 13:35.813
if one of those clots hits
his heart, it'll kill him.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.016
Sly, you're gonna hate
what I'm about to tell you,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.018
but you have to head back

13:40.019 --> 13:42.019
to that outcropping of rocks
we passed half a mile back

13:42.022 --> 13:43.321
and catch a rattlesnake.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.156
Venom is a natural
anticoagulant.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.259
For cabe, I will catch
one with my bare hands.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.395
I got to borrow your
pliers to pick up the snake.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.163
On my truck.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.565
Okay, we all know
what we need to do.

13:53.567 --> 13:54.566
Let's get it done.

13:54.568 --> 13:58.336
♪ ♪

13:59.840 --> 14:01.072
Hey, don't cut it too short,

14:01.074 --> 14:03.608
I need about ten feet of hose.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.547
Got it.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.124
Paige:
I'll fill it!

14:23.330 --> 14:26.030
Toby: All right, I got my end,
lay it down.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.438
Almost done, how much longer?

14:33.440 --> 14:34.439
Paige:
Almost full.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.140
(Both grunting)
Look out!

14:36.142 --> 14:37.242
Lay him in carefully.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.509
One wrong jostle

14:38.511 --> 14:41.112
and that clip
pops off his aorta.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.181
(Cabe grunts and pants)

14:46.386 --> 14:48.419
Toby:
All right, cabe, we got you set.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.389
Any minute now,
happy's gonna do her thing.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.192
Just need to stay calm, keep
your heart rate down, buddy.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.369
Okay, I'm ready.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.137
Put the nail can on his wound

15:06.139 --> 15:08.072
while I freeze the water.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.307
How does this even work?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.508
Truck's intake will pull in air

15:10.510 --> 15:12.076
through this hose.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.411
That'll pull the air
from the upside down bucket

15:13.413 --> 15:14.679
creating a vacuum

15:14.681 --> 15:17.448
that will pull vapor
from the water beneath it,

15:17.450 --> 15:19.417
creating high-speed,
powerful evaporation.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.085
Which sly said
is the cooling process.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.220
Exactly.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.772
An engine as strong
as the truck's

15:23.773 --> 15:25.323
will super-cool the water
pretty fast.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.391
Dramatically fast.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.259
That's how we'll freeze him.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.195
(Breathing weakly)

15:31.197 --> 15:34.332
Cabe, this is where
the rubber meets the road.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.001
When we start this process,

15:37.003 --> 15:39.003
your body temperature

15:39.005 --> 15:40.438
is gonna drop
to unnatural levels.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.476
Your heart'll stop.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.514
Odds?

15:54.721 --> 15:58.222
Five percent... tops.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.664
I trust you kids.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.433
Do it.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.401
Toby:
I'll place the can when
the water starts to freeze.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.470
I got to get the thermometer.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.477
Hey, roomie?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.379
We still got to finish
stratego, right?

16:24.284 --> 16:27.285
Cabe, I'm gonna do everything
in my ability to bring you back.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.253
If not...

16:29.255 --> 16:30.989
It's not your fault.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.391
Cabe, you cannot leave me alone

16:33.393 --> 16:35.426
with these guys, okay?

16:40.033 --> 16:42.100
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.508
(Thermometer beeping)
All right, start it up.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.643
(Beeps twice)

16:52.645 --> 16:55.179
Okay.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.447
(Engine starts)

16:59.686 --> 17:02.253
Oh, it's working, it's getting
colder by the second.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.288
His temp's dropping.
God, his lips are turning blue.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.723
Toby: That's good.
That's what we want.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.258
Guys, making a cabe-sicle
is pointless

17:07.260 --> 17:09.127
if we can't safely reheat him.
You have to go get

17:09.129 --> 17:10.094
that hydrogen sulfide gas.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.562
Okay, all we need to get

17:11.564 --> 17:14.132
is the wet vac,
wire, an oil funnel

17:14.134 --> 17:16.234
and that battery
from happy's truck.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.336
(Beeps)
Sly, we're all doing our part
over here!

17:18.338 --> 17:20.138
How's the snake hunt going?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.639
I found one.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.241
I think he knows I'm after him.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.176
(Hissing)
He's kind of under
the ledge of a bridge.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.210
Happy (Over radio):
You can lure it out.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.345
You've got an IQ over 180.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.379
You can outsmart a snake.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.248
Toby, how much colder

17:30.250 --> 17:32.150
does the water need to get?

17:32.152 --> 17:33.751
I'm not sure how much the
engine can handle in this heat.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.253
He's at 90.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.754
We got to drop another 32.
Keep it going.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.390
Happy:
Okay, copy that.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.296
I'm prepping
40cc's of ice water

17:45.298 --> 17:46.831
that's about 48 to 50 degrees.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.200
I'm gonna shoot it
right into your heart.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.635
Last few beats of
your pumper will spread it

17:50.636 --> 17:52.069
through your arteries,
but once I do it,

17:52.072 --> 17:53.604
you're gonna lose consciousness.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.173
All right, buddy,

17:55.175 --> 17:56.707
here we go.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.489
(Both grunt)

18:18.631 --> 18:21.132
We won't let you down, cabe.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.170
(Engine rumbles and hisses)

18:26.172 --> 18:27.238
Not good.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.240
What the hell?!
Happy!

18:29.242 --> 18:31.876
Get the engine up and running!
We need him cold!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.744
Not warming up!
What do you think
I'm about to do?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.213
Happy, what happened
to the engine?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.814
Blew the hose.

18:36.816 --> 18:37.882
I'm working on it.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.350
Is cabe frozen yet?

18:39.352 --> 18:41.152
No, and without
this engine running,

18:41.154 --> 18:43.321
he won't get there,
he'll just bleed out!

18:43.323 --> 18:44.422
I said I'm working on it!

18:44.424 --> 18:45.490
I'm swapping in a hose

18:45.492 --> 18:46.691
from the backhoe.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.127
Oh, damn it!
Toby:
What?

18:49.129 --> 18:50.261
It's cracked from the sun.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.232
I can't start the engine again.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.308
What do you mean you can't get
it running again, happy?

19:04.310 --> 19:05.309
You can fix anything!

19:05.311 --> 19:07.578
Not without a hose, I can't!

19:07.580 --> 19:08.913
Aah!
Damn it.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.783
I have an idea.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.252
I'm gonna make a hose.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.554
You need to refill the radiator!

19:16.556 --> 19:17.755
Get me a bucket of water!
Roger that.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.865
Happy, what's your plan?

19:27.867 --> 19:29.634
Happy:
Working on it.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.704
Rubber boot plus zip ties
equals rubber hose.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.773
Nice.
Nice.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.442
Oh, ah, damn it.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.878
Why did science have to make
water so heavy?

19:40.880 --> 19:44.248
How's that hose coming?
It's strong but I'm not sure
if it's strong enough!

19:44.250 --> 19:45.416
These boots

19:45.418 --> 19:47.218
were made for walking,
not pumping.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.753
Wow, a joke from happy
in a tense situation.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.621
You must be really scared.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.756
You're not?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.624
I'm scared to death.
Cabe's death.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.560
I'm done.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.694
Me, too!

19:56.696 --> 19:58.229
Happy's gonna
give this a shot.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.497
What if it doesn't work?

19:59.499 --> 20:00.965
Cabe dies.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.768
Happy:
Not gonna happen.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.637
Come on.
(Engine stalling)

20:09.909 --> 20:12.443
Happy: Come on.
(Engine catches)

20:12.445 --> 20:13.644
That's my girl.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.246
Toby: And we're back!

20:15.248 --> 20:16.447
Happy's evaporation
vacuum machine

20:16.449 --> 20:18.416
is sucking as much air
as it sucked before,

20:18.418 --> 20:20.585
but in this case, sucking
is a really good thing.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.954
Sly, all this is for naught
if you can't get that venom.

20:22.956 --> 20:26.357
I have a plan. I'm going
to use sensory jujitsu

20:26.359 --> 20:27.992
to lure this reptile
out of his nook,

20:27.994 --> 20:30.361
and then nab it.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.696
I'm gonna use real
jujitsu on you

20:31.698 --> 20:32.930
if you don't get that rattler!

20:32.932 --> 20:34.966
I will.
Let me explain.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.768
Rattlesnakes don't
hunt using vision.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.670
They feel vibrations
and sense heat.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.306
So I am putting
my cell phone on vibrate,

20:42.308 --> 20:44.308
and running multiple apps
to heat it up,

20:44.310 --> 20:45.543
and putting it
in my sock.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.777
Remind me to never
borrow your phone.

20:46.779 --> 20:50.248
Then I am pulling
a string from the sock

20:50.250 --> 20:54.485
so I can dangle this
fake kangaroo rat
(Phone buzzing)

20:54.487 --> 20:55.786
In front of the snake.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.405
I am ringing the dinner bell

20:57.406 --> 20:59.023
and counting on
150 million years

20:59.025 --> 21:01.759
of limited evolution
to take over.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.761
Here, snakey-snakey.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.895
(Phone buzzing)

21:04.897 --> 21:07.265
Boss, even with that venom,

21:07.267 --> 21:08.833
if we don't get
the hydrogen sulfide

21:08.835 --> 21:11.369
to protect cabe's organs upon
re-entry to the real world,

21:11.371 --> 21:12.620
we're still screwed.

21:12.621 --> 21:13.870
Paige: Okay, we're almost
at the hot Springs.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.473
Three more miles.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.974
Toby: That's good,
'cause we're ahead of schedule.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.043
Cabe's body temperature's
falling fast.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.512
We'll be ready.
Keep us posted.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.019
It's chilly in here, huh?

21:28.021 --> 21:29.687
Hmm.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.493
Strange, given how hot
it is outside.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.561
Guess the a/c really cranks.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.196
If only cabe's
makeshift pool

21:39.197 --> 21:40.830
had such an effective
refrigerant.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.335
All right, so I know
you're upset about Tim...

21:44.337 --> 21:46.771
Walter, the only thing
I'm thinking about right now

21:46.773 --> 21:47.738
is cabe and how serious
this is.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.373
Understood.
I mean,

21:49.375 --> 21:51.442
someone has to think about it.

21:51.444 --> 21:54.478
I'm sorry, did you mean
something by that?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.514
We all had a chance
to say good-bye to cabe

21:56.516 --> 21:57.682
in case we never see him again.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.717
A moment to tell him

21:59.719 --> 22:01.852
what he means to us.

22:01.854 --> 22:05.056
You told him it's been
a pleasure working with him.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.791
Any idea how messed up that is?

22:06.793 --> 22:08.693
We were pressed for time.
Please, Walter!

22:08.695 --> 22:10.528
I've been working
so hard with you

22:10.530 --> 22:12.530
for 2 years now.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.465
I thought you'd been
making progress,

22:14.466 --> 22:16.399
but for every step forward
you take a hundred steps back.

22:16.402 --> 22:17.935
Well, it has been
a pleasure working with him.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.704
And that's the last thing
you wanted to say to him?

22:19.706 --> 22:21.839
Toby has a shot
at saving a man

22:21.841 --> 22:23.908
who is bleeding to death
in the middle of the desert,

22:23.910 --> 22:25.509
but I don't know if there's
a cure for what you have.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.128
For all I know,
you're suffering

22:27.129 --> 22:28.746
an immense inner turmoil
over cabe potentially dying,

22:28.748 --> 22:31.415
or you truly feel nothing.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.817
I-i want to help you, Walter,

22:32.819 --> 22:34.885
but I don't know
if you can be helped.

22:34.887 --> 22:39.390
And that... makes me so...

22:39.392 --> 22:41.425
Sad.

22:44.731 --> 22:48.566
Uh, there's a turn
right past those rocks.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.401
The hot Springs is
just around the bend.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.408
(Engine idling)

22:59.445 --> 23:01.712
Doc, time check.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.414
This thing is gonna
overheat any second.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.966
Just a few more seconds,

23:04.967 --> 23:06.517
'cause this tub's
gonna do the opposite.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.919
(Ice cracking)

23:13.159 --> 23:14.825
It's freezing!

23:14.827 --> 23:17.828
Sweet. I'm gonna siphon some
gasoline for the super glue.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.665
58 degrees!
We have a cabe-sicle!

23:21.667 --> 23:23.100
I was gonna say ice-ice cabe-y,

23:23.102 --> 23:24.835
but "cabe-sicle"
just came to me.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.705
And you kiss me
with that mouth?!

23:27.707 --> 23:28.873
Not if you don't shut up!

23:28.875 --> 23:30.775
Toby:
Is it working?

23:30.777 --> 23:31.942
Looks nice and gluey.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.110
All right,
it should hold.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.111
All right, let's
do a dry run

23:34.113 --> 23:35.980
on this wet,
fake aorta.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.114
I'll push the edges together,
you spread a nice,

23:37.116 --> 23:38.416
thin layer
over the cut line.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.017
I'm familiar with
how glue works.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.052
It should dry fast.
Whoa.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.654
Check that out,
it's holding.

23:43.656 --> 23:44.889
That'll survive
any chopper flight.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.991
Okay, so much
for the test run.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.192
You ready for
the main event?

23:50.863 --> 23:53.898
Don't mind me.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.866
I'm just a fat kangaroo rat
who's lost in the desert.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.001
(Phone buzzing)

23:57.003 --> 23:58.669
Sure hope a big ol' snake

23:58.671 --> 24:00.771
doesn't come up
and eat me for lunch.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.909
Seriously?

24:04.911 --> 24:08.779
I'm full of iron
and proteins. Num-num.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.915
(Buzzing)
Num-num.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.918
This is ridiculous.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.553
You should be jumping
at the chance

24:15.555 --> 24:18.222
to gobble up this little fella.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.690
The only reason
you wouldn't feed

24:19.692 --> 24:21.826
would be because
you're pregnant.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.227
But in that case,
there should be

24:23.229 --> 24:24.962
a daddy snake
down here with you.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.931
(Rattling)

24:28.868 --> 24:30.634
Oh...

24:30.636 --> 24:32.970
It seems daddy snake
is up here with me.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.872
This is a problem.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.740
(Rattling)

24:42.849 --> 24:44.715
Got it.
Drop your comms
out for now.

24:44.717 --> 24:45.716
We don't need the
others listening in

24:45.718 --> 24:46.884
to what's about
to go down,

24:46.886 --> 24:48.452
in case it doesn't work.

24:48.453 --> 24:50.019
Hey, cabe, we're
gonna patch you up,

24:50.022 --> 24:52.523
warm you up, and you're
gonna wake up, deal?

24:52.525 --> 24:53.858
He doesn't feel like talking.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.693
Well, he does seem
a little blue.
You kidding me?

24:55.695 --> 24:57.561
I'm nervous.
I don't know if this'll work.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.763
Uh, and...

24:59.765 --> 25:02.967
Uh, there she is.

25:02.969 --> 25:06.003
One binder clip coming up.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.605
Ah.
That's so gross.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.608
Okay, time to put those
sticky fingers to work.

25:10.610 --> 25:11.942
What? Me?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.143
I need both hands to
pinch the artery tight.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.178
You apply the glue.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.147
You know how I am
about blood.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.115
I do. Now, how are you
about your friends dying?

25:18.117 --> 25:21.085
All right.
There you go.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.621
Now, slide 'em in
right over my fingers.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.625
Slide 'em down
and find the artery.

25:27.627 --> 25:28.893
There it is.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.311
You got it.

25:30.312 --> 25:31.728
It's just like putting
your hand inside of a pumpkin,

25:31.731 --> 25:33.130
but instead of a pumpkin,
your hand's inside

25:33.132 --> 25:34.932
cabe's body cavity.
Oh, god.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.934
Slide your fingers down
a half inch.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.302
Okay, you're
right on the cut.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.171
Spread the glue
all over.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.573
Don't be stingy.

25:42.575 --> 25:43.908
It feels like
cold spaghetti.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.843
Good news,
you're done.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.011
Remove your paw
from the federal agent.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.012
Okay.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.748
Whoa. I'd fist bump you,

25:50.750 --> 25:52.783
but our hands are
covered in guts.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.951
Hey.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.020
Huh?

25:56.022 --> 25:57.555
I'm really proud of you.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.089
I just hope the others
are getting what we need.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.125
Oh, boy, this is an issue.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.928
Paige: Excuse me, sir,

26:03.930 --> 26:06.096
we don't want to...

26:06.098 --> 26:07.765
You know, um,
and we need to collect

26:07.767 --> 26:09.967
some hydrogen sulfide
for a friend.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.136
Guard: Yeah, sorry, folks,
private property, nudists only.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.004
If we don't get what we need
and get back to our team soon,

26:14.006 --> 26:15.406
then a man could die.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.807
Look, I've heard
every story in the book

26:16.809 --> 26:18.809
from perverts that wanna
get all sneaky-peaky

26:18.811 --> 26:19.977
without undressing
themselves.

26:19.979 --> 26:20.978
But you're not naked.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.613
I just work here.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.181
Drop trou, don't come in,
i don't care.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.983
Uh...

26:27.086 --> 26:30.020
What are you doing?
You want to save cabe?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.355
Nude up, genius-boy.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.635
70 degrees.
The ice is melting.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.003
This isn't good. We have
to start thinning his blood

26:46.005 --> 26:47.004
before he warms up too much.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.205
Why don't I just
start the truck

26:48.207 --> 26:49.785
and re-freeze him, then?

26:49.786 --> 26:51.364
But there's nothing on the
chopper to keep him frozen.

26:51.365 --> 26:52.943
He has to be alive,
with his heart beating,

26:52.945 --> 26:54.612
when that chopper
takes off.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.897
So we have to start
warming him up,

26:55.898 --> 26:57.181
but even a small blood clot's
gonna kill him.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.682
Where the hell is sly
with that snake?

26:58.684 --> 27:01.652
(Yelling)

27:01.654 --> 27:03.354
Take it away
from me.

27:03.356 --> 27:06.090
Ooh, ooh, take it
far away from me, please.

27:06.092 --> 27:09.159
Take it away! Oh...
(Rattling)

27:09.161 --> 27:10.260
I gotta be honest,
i didn't think

27:10.262 --> 27:11.261
you'd catch
one of these critters.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.263
That thing is
untrustworthy.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.398
He snuck up on me.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.400
You're a rattlesnake.
Use your rattle!

27:16.402 --> 27:18.235
All right, doc, how are you
extracting the venom?

27:18.237 --> 27:20.104
We're not. The snake's
gonna<i> intract</i> venom.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.639
You're gonna
let him bite cabe?

27:21.641 --> 27:23.007
No, they're gonna kiss.
Yes, sly!

27:23.009 --> 27:24.742
He bites cabe,
the venom goes in,

27:24.744 --> 27:26.644
and gallo doesn't die
from blood clots.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.112
How about dying
from a snake bite?

27:28.114 --> 27:29.813
No, big guys can handle
big doses.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.315
Besides, a chopper
from a desert hospital

27:31.317 --> 27:32.883
will have antivenin.
Why are you hesitating?

27:32.885 --> 27:34.385
Because it's kinda
messed up

27:34.387 --> 27:36.286
to force a snake
to bite your friend!

27:36.288 --> 27:38.422
Would you let me
ease into this, please?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.692
(Exhales)

27:41.694 --> 27:42.960
Okay.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.696
Come on,
you diamondback bastard.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.731
(Hissing)

27:47.733 --> 27:49.733
Come on, I'm serving him up
on a platter.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.770
Oh! Perfect shot.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.240
Uh, uh...

27:59.712 --> 28:01.879
Your assistance is
greatly appreciated.

28:01.881 --> 28:05.683
(Rattling)

28:05.685 --> 28:07.418
Walt, cabe's got a shot
of vitamin rattlesnake.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.020
Where are you with
the hydrogen sulfide gas?

28:11.857 --> 28:14.058
Collecting it now.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.794
Walter: Okay, lower your
electrode into the water.

28:16.796 --> 28:19.763
I am going to pass
a small electrical current

28:19.765 --> 28:22.332
from my electrode down
the wire to your electrode.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.802
This will split the water
into oxygen and hydrogen,

28:24.804 --> 28:26.070
which will combine
with the sulfur in the water

28:26.072 --> 28:29.440
to make hydrogen
sulfide bubbles.

28:29.442 --> 28:31.008
Just hurry.
That dude's trying

28:31.010 --> 28:33.243
to get a peak
at my... bubbles.

28:35.781 --> 28:38.482
Okay.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.818
Starting the current.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.386
(Bubbling loudly)

28:44.457 --> 28:46.890
You may notice a mild
tingling sensation.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.759
That's just the weak
electrical current

28:48.761 --> 28:50.961
stimulating nerve endings.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.430
Great. Didn't think this
could get more awkward.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.737
(Vacuum sucking loudly)

28:59.739 --> 29:03.507
Oh, it... stinks
like rotten eggs.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.809
Oh, yeah, that's
the hydrogen sulfide.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.345
It means the electrolysis
is working.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.747
Oh...

29:13.786 --> 29:15.018
You can really feel
the tingling, can't you?

29:15.020 --> 29:16.053
Just stop talking.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.822
Understood.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.293
Mesquite will
strengthen the flame.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.028
And give cabe
a nice, smoky flavor.

29:25.030 --> 29:28.165
It's warm.
He's almost thawed.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.868
Couldn't let him get to
78 degrees without the venom,

29:30.870 --> 29:32.370
and now we can't let him
get to 98

29:32.371 --> 29:33.871
without those hot spring fumes.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.172
Walt, Paige, eta.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.107
A minute away,

29:37.109 --> 29:39.109
and I've got
a tank full of stinky gas.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.911
I hope she's talking
about the shop-vac.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.546
No, the hydrogen sulfide
collection

29:42.548 --> 29:44.214
went off without a stitch.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.516
Uh, I mean hitch.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.817
It went off
without a hitch.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.385
No problem whatsoever.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.457
Toby:
He's at 92.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.975
Let's put out the flames

29:54.976 --> 29:56.492
and let the steaming water
gently warm him

29:56.495 --> 29:57.861
until he reaches 98.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.228
Then, the normal autorhythmicity
of his heart will kick in.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.298
It'll beat on its own,

30:01.300 --> 30:02.533
and he'll be okay.

30:02.535 --> 30:04.468
Not if Walt and Paige
don't get here.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.036
(Car engine rumbling)
Look.

30:13.546 --> 30:14.912
Help me with the shop-vac!

30:14.914 --> 30:15.913
Coming!

30:15.915 --> 30:17.848
He's zooming past 94.

30:17.850 --> 30:18.849
Get that hydrogen sulfide
over here!

30:20.986 --> 30:24.855
Walter: Come on. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.457
Okay.

30:29.094 --> 30:30.093
Toby:
All right.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.495
I'll pinch his nose.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.497
You create a seal
around his mouth.
Sylvester: Okay.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.532
Happy, pass that gas.

30:36.435 --> 30:37.835
Valve is wide open.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.437
Oh, that's strong.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.907
Oh, I can't believe cabe
has to ingest this stuff.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.342
Up to 96 degrees.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.411
Perfectly on target.
Another degree or two,

30:47.413 --> 30:48.612
and his heart should
start beating on its own.

30:48.614 --> 30:49.980
Incredible, we fixed his aorta,

30:49.982 --> 30:51.548
thinned his blood,
gassed up his lungs.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.067
This is really gonna work,
isn't it?

30:53.068 --> 30:54.585
I can't believe
we did it. We did it.

30:54.587 --> 30:55.619
Walter:
Uh, guys.

30:55.621 --> 30:56.920
Guys, Toby, cabe's temperature

30:56.922 --> 30:58.155
is up to 99 degrees.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.623
That can't be right.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.391
At this temp, his heart
should've restarted by now.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.360
No, the thermometer
says 99 degrees.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.629
Toby:
Cabe? Cabe?

31:05.631 --> 31:06.880
We got to get him
out of here

31:06.881 --> 31:08.130
before he gets too hot,
or his heart

31:08.133 --> 31:09.633
will never restart.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.201
Why isn't this working?

31:11.203 --> 31:14.171
(All grunting)

31:18.644 --> 31:21.078
Cabe, wake up.
You can do this.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.913
You're gonna leave me
after we've become friends?

31:22.915 --> 31:24.915
Still nothing!

31:24.917 --> 31:26.183
I swear to god, if you die,

31:26.185 --> 31:28.151
I will not wear that pin
just to piss you off.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.220
Toby: Come on, cabe.
You got to come back!

31:31.490 --> 31:33.624
He's not responding.
Quick, get out of the way.

31:33.626 --> 31:36.193
Get out of the way!

31:38.030 --> 31:41.431
Come on, cabe.
Come-come on, cabe.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.368
Come on. Come on,
cabe. Come on!

31:44.370 --> 31:47.037
Come on, cabe.
Come on.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.012
Let's go. Let's go!

31:55.014 --> 31:57.080
Come on, cabe!

31:59.418 --> 32:00.617
Come on, cabe!

32:00.619 --> 32:03.053
Manual cpr won't do it.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.188
Our only chance of getting
cabe's heart beating again

32:05.190 --> 32:07.190
is the application
of an electrical current.

32:07.191 --> 32:09.191
How? I don't exactly see a
portable defibrillator anywhere.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.428
No, but we do have electricity.
Okay, quick.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.563
Lean him against the metal rim
of the tub. Just do it.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.067
(All grunting)

32:20.406 --> 32:22.105
Careful, he'll drown!

32:22.107 --> 32:24.007
No, he won't.
He's not inhaling.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.142
He's dead.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.145
Sylvester:
Is she planning to do

32:28.147 --> 32:29.630
what I think
she's planning to do?

32:29.631 --> 32:31.114
She's gonna throw the toaster
in the bathtub with cabe.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.283
Okay, everyone back away
from the toolbox!

32:34.353 --> 32:36.053
Please let this work.

32:39.024 --> 32:40.524
(Electricity crackles)

32:40.526 --> 32:43.226
Cabe? Cabe!

32:45.030 --> 32:46.129
Still nothing.

32:49.001 --> 32:50.667
Please don't let this happen.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.173
I got a lub and a dub!

32:56.175 --> 32:58.175
Ah!
Toby:
Lub dub! Lub dub!

32:58.177 --> 32:59.343
(Walter and Sylvester laughing)

32:59.344 --> 33:00.510
It fixed... it's tired,
but steady!

33:00.512 --> 33:01.712
Cabe's heart's beating!

33:01.714 --> 33:03.680
Oh!
Toby: Ah!

33:05.084 --> 33:07.417
Welcome back, cabe.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.121
Oh, man...

33:11.123 --> 33:13.056
Heaven's full of nerds.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.125
(Chuckles)

33:16.362 --> 33:18.428
(Chuckles weakly)

33:19.498 --> 33:21.198
(Laughs)

33:21.200 --> 33:22.766
(Helicopter blades whirring)

33:28.007 --> 33:31.041
Well...

33:31.043 --> 33:33.176
Looks like your ride's here.

33:39.084 --> 33:41.235
Pilot:
Sir, sorry.

33:41.236 --> 33:43.387
Liability rules dictate
only family can come aboard.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.756
I am family;
He's my father.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.427
Okay, get in.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.376
♪ ♪

34:09.348 --> 34:12.282
(Monitor beeping)

34:15.087 --> 34:17.754
(Sighs)

34:17.756 --> 34:19.156
How am I doing, kid?

34:20.426 --> 34:22.159
Surgery went well.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.063
I'm, uh...
(Clears throat)

34:26.065 --> 34:27.164
...tracking
your cardiac function

34:27.166 --> 34:29.066
with my own oxygen
demand formula

34:29.068 --> 34:31.101
and ejection fraction composite,

34:31.103 --> 34:34.071
so I foresee a full recovery.

34:34.073 --> 34:38.375
So much for a relaxing day
in the desert sun, huh?

34:44.316 --> 34:46.216
I should tell you that...

34:49.521 --> 34:51.254
...the others,
they're concerned,

34:51.256 --> 34:54.224
so I should, um, uh...

34:54.226 --> 34:56.126
Bring them in
if you're feeling up to it.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.463
Sure.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.598
Yeah, okay.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.404
(Groans lightly)

35:10.642 --> 35:12.442
I'm sorry i-i...

35:12.444 --> 35:16.246
I'm sorry I didn't use
appropriate words

35:16.248 --> 35:18.882
before we stopped your heart.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.820
As you know, I have...

35:23.822 --> 35:25.222
(Lightly chuckles)

35:25.224 --> 35:28.825
...i have issues
expressing myself.

35:32.197 --> 35:36.333
It's been more than "a pleasure"
working with you.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.634
As I said in the garage,

35:37.636 --> 35:41.338
we could find another
federal agent, but...

35:43.542 --> 35:44.841
...but, uh,

35:44.843 --> 35:48.912
we couldn't find another
cabe gallo.

35:50.883 --> 35:52.716
Makes all the difference.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.552
It's okay.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.354
I know you care about me.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.256
It's much more than that.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.261
I love you, cabe.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.367
I love you.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.270
I love you, too, son.

36:18.911 --> 36:21.178
(Door opens)

36:26.385 --> 36:28.385
Oh, boy, look at this crew.

36:28.387 --> 36:31.221
Thought we'd bring
our sunny day to you.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.523
We brought you
some iced coffee.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.393
I think I'll try to avoid ice
for a while.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.879
Makes sense.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.364
Hey, roomie, you might hear
that I yelled at you a lot

36:41.366 --> 36:42.265
when you were dead.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.467
I was just motivating you.

36:44.469 --> 36:45.969
It's okay.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.470
I assume you were all going
a little nuts out there.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.439
Thank you.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.710
I'm gonna go share my, uh,
medical data with the doctors.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.448
(Door opens)

37:00.419 --> 37:01.618
(Door closes)

37:07.392 --> 37:10.427
Walter, are you okay?

37:10.429 --> 37:12.596
Of course I am.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.897
I can't decipher you.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.666
Just when I'm sure you're
an android, you're not.

37:23.775 --> 37:26.276
I know you get frustrated
when I take steps backward,

37:26.278 --> 37:28.345
but I don't mean to do it;
I just do.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.917
There are parts of my brain that
work so much worse than others.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.518
I know.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.621
You're still mad with me

37:37.623 --> 37:38.622
about Tim, aren't you?

37:38.624 --> 37:40.957
I am.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.425
I have every right to be,

37:42.427 --> 37:43.927
but right now it's not
about you or me or Tim.

37:43.929 --> 37:48.265
It's about... cabe,
so let's just...

37:48.267 --> 37:50.634
Put it aside for the night and
appreciate he's still with us.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.336
Agreed.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.971
You can talk
to the doctor later.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.506
Let's try to keep cabe company.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.284
You know, I was thinking,
after all I've been through,

38:07.286 --> 38:08.918
that maybe I should ask
that Allie girl

38:08.920 --> 38:10.587
out to that Italian place.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.005
Superlative idea.

38:12.006 --> 38:13.422
There you go.
Get back up on that horse.

38:13.425 --> 38:16.059
I'm fine with it,
but I'm reserving final approval

38:16.061 --> 38:17.994
until I determine whether
she's good enough for you.

38:19.998 --> 38:23.033
Maybe I'll wear one of those
Hawaiian shirts on our date.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.902
Bad idea.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.770
We're in these nightmares
because our clothes are wet

38:26.772 --> 38:28.838
and sunbaked at the same time.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.574
Oh, yeah, speaking of which,
why did you guys come back

38:31.576 --> 38:33.310
from the hot Springs
in pristine condition?

38:33.312 --> 38:34.978
Huh? What?
No. What?

38:34.980 --> 38:36.880
Clothes are dry.
And you have to get
into the water

38:36.882 --> 38:38.098
in order to use the electrodes.

38:38.099 --> 38:39.315
Well, the low humidity
of desert air

38:39.318 --> 38:40.784
dries fabric incredibly quickly.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.352
Happy: You should have
white salt lines

38:42.354 --> 38:43.953
on your clothes from the sulfur.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.555
Where are they?

38:46.491 --> 38:47.691
Holy skinny-dips!

38:47.693 --> 38:49.659
You went to
a nudist spring!

38:49.661 --> 38:51.594
You two saw each other's parts.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.530
We did what we had
to do to save cabe.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.566
Uh... it was very...
Professional.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.535
And naked.
It was so sunny out there.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.636
You could've burned
your schmeckle.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.638
Now I wish I got hit
with the shrapnel.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.774
Okay, well, uh, I'm gonna
go to kovelsky's.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.710
Get some food.
Hey, Walter, Paige,

39:06.712 --> 39:08.511
can I get you guys anything?
Melons and sausages?

39:08.513 --> 39:09.679
Cantaloupes and wieners?

39:09.681 --> 39:11.681
I will kill you.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.584
Tater tots and salami?

39:16.088 --> 39:17.053
Ooh.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.955
It's very amusing.

39:18.957 --> 39:22.759
I had to die for an hour to
finally get some peace and quiet

39:22.761 --> 39:23.893
from you guys.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.867
(Laughs)
