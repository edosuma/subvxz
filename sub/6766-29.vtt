WEBVTT

00:04.254 --> 00:05.880
Hey, you got any of those, uh,

00:05.964 --> 00:08.132
big fat red felt pens?

00:08.216 --> 00:09.884
{\an1}She wants me to critique
her term paper.

00:09.968 --> 00:10.885
(laughs)

00:10.969 --> 00:11.970
Anything else?

00:12.053 --> 00:12.971
No, that's it.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.723
{\an3}Would you buy me
one of those

00:14.806 --> 00:16.474
{\an1}lottery Scratchers
Not a chance.se?

00:16.558 --> 00:18.435
They're a waste of money.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.978
{\an3}Fine, at least lend
me 50 cents.

00:20.061 --> 00:24.315
{\an1}Okay, but you got to go 50-50
on your winnings with me.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.692
You're our witness.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.026
Lucky me.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.654
Good luck.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.450
Can you give me
another coin?

00:33.533 --> 00:35.076
{\an3}I need something
to scratch it with.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.289
Give me that.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.126
Oh, man.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.627
What, another dud, huh?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.337
{\an1}Oh, man!

00:46.421 --> 00:48.965
All right, all right, now you
can say I told you so.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.176
Oh, man!

00:51.259 --> 00:52.969
{\an1}SUSAN:
We've got a match!

00:53.052 --> 00:54.012
Look at the numbers.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.681
My God, we won $5,000, Brandon.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.892
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:58.975 --> 00:59.768
Excuse me.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.811
{\an3}Hi, can we get a
confirmation on this?

01:01.895 --> 01:02.979
Is, is that a winner?

01:03.062 --> 01:04.480
That's a winner.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.274
{\an1}Great, we'll take
it in cash.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.986
You guys think I have $5,000
just laying around?

01:10.069 --> 01:12.989
You guys have to take this to
the California Lottery Office.

01:13.072 --> 01:13.990
The nearest one is in Van Nuys.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.367
Van Nuys. Great. Thank you.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.456
♪ ♪

01:48.274 --> 01:50.276
♪ ♪

02:14.133 --> 02:16.052
♪ ♪

03:10.064 --> 03:11.274
Is it really necessary to ruin

03:11.357 --> 03:13.776
a perfectly good year
of school with finals.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.070
Well, you can't have winners
unless you keep score.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.782
I am so caffeined out and
the week isn't even half over.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.909
You know what guys,

03:20.992 --> 03:22.827
we really need to get another
study group together.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.454
Clare, you think you and Steve

03:24.537 --> 03:27.790
can, uh, break off hanging out
with royalty for one evening?

03:27.874 --> 03:30.084
{\an3}Well, I can, but I
don't know about Steve.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.712
{\an3}He's acting like he found
his long lost brother.

03:32.795 --> 03:36.090
How long does His Royal Highness
plan on sticking around anyway?

03:36.174 --> 03:38.301
{\an3}As long as
he wants, I guess.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.636
I got to go.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.971
French Lit, final
review. Au revoir.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.014
Bye.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.849
{\an1}Oh, Donna, I
almost forgot,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.143
Erik Budman sent over
some CDs last night.

03:47.226 --> 03:48.978
Yeah, all MZA artists?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.688
Yeah. He wants our feedback
as soon as possible.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.317
Cool. You know what, I'll take
half and you take half.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.152
{\an1}That's exactly what
Ha.as thinking.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.529
{\an4}JOE:
Hey, Silver,
think fast!

03:58.613 --> 04:00.156
{\an1}Hey, man, thanks
for the loan.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.825
{\an1}You think Yancy is gonna
hand out the same exam

04:02.909 --> 04:03.993
he did last semester?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.162
The guy wears
the same tie every day.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.830
You tell me.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.999
Call me as soon as you're
done listening to those.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.334
Yeah, I will.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.335
Catch you guys later.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.504
Thanks again, David.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.673
So, sounds like MZA is
really hot for you guys.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.841
Well, I hope so.

04:18.925 --> 04:19.759
You ready for art history?

04:19.841 --> 04:22.011
{\an3}I better be. I was up
half the night.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.012
What about you?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.597
I'm finished with exams.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.848
{\an1}Finished my last one
this morning.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.476
{\an1}Now I just have summer
drills tomorrow morning.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.520
Oh, really?

04:30.603 --> 04:31.646
Are you excited?

04:31.729 --> 04:32.647
Oh, I guess.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.941
{\an1}I just have to bring
my 40-yard dash up to speed.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.986
Want me to come time you?

04:38.069 --> 04:39.529
I don't know.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.030
{\an1}I've been out of
commission so long,

04:41.114 --> 04:42.031
{\an1}I wouldn't want
to embarrass myself.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.534
{\an3}Oh, right, like I'm gonna
know the difference.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.453
It might be nice
to have you there.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.663
Give me some inspiration.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.084
I need some more inspiration.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.838
You might really inspire me.

04:56.921 --> 04:57.964
Ooh.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.385
You're, uh, you're going to need

05:02.468 --> 05:04.137
{\an3}some more boxes
for these clothes.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.557
Just trash 'em.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.851
Are you kidding?

05:09.934 --> 05:11.936
You've got some
beautiful things here.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.230
In two years, they'll all be
out of style anyway.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.606
It doesn't matter.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.902
I can't believe this is
happening to us.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.362
Me neither.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.406
But it is.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.742
{\an3}You know,
it's twisted.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.953
It's not like you're some
hardened criminal

05:29.037 --> 05:29.996
that's a menace to society.

05:30.079 --> 05:33.708
You're just a nice,

05:33.791 --> 05:35.918
harmless, great guy.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.087
Tell it to the judge.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.964
I wish I could.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.637
It's just not fair.

05:49.307 --> 05:54.896
Fair or not, we can't change
what's going to happen tomorrow.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.900
(voice breaking):
I know.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.369
I'm all right.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.164
Hey, you.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.667
Don't check out on me.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.835
I can't help it.

06:17.919 --> 06:22.048
{\an1}My heart's just falling
out of sight here.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.384
Come here.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.097
You're going to be okay.

06:29.180 --> 06:33.518
No, I'm not.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.311
I'm really going to miss you.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.481
I'm scared for you.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.943
I know.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.778
I'm scared, too.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.167
{\an1}Well, I hate to boast,
but I have excellent taste.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.168
Yes, you do.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.670
{\an3}I like it.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.839
{\an1}Maybe you can wear it
your first day back at school.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.006
That is, if you're
ready to go back.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.174
I think I am.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.093
And I think I'm ready
to go home, too.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.845
Are you sure?

07:08.928 --> 07:11.556
{\an3}You can stay here
as longNo, I'm sure.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.642
{\an5}But thank you. It's
so nice to have Mom's
house to retreat to.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.019
Stay for lunch?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.981
Very funny.king?

07:20.064 --> 07:22.483
Honey, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.693
You really deserve it.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.989
Then why do I have to go to
summer school five days a week?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.408
Well, at least
you'll be well dressed.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.034
Thanks to you.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.578
(phone ringing)

07:39.041 --> 07:40.251
Hello.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.670
Hello?

07:42.753 --> 07:43.963
Hello?

07:47.967 --> 07:48.926
Who was that?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.303
I don't know, hang up.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.946
Yes, yes! He does it!

08:09.030 --> 08:11.741
{\an4}I think this is the birth
of an international
champion, my friend.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.992
Game, set, match.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.203
I guess I owe you lunch.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.205
{\an1}Clare said you were
a poor sport.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.458
{\an3}Yeah, yeah, well, tell
Clare I've matured.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.044
She still has trouble thinking
I have a shred of human decency.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.921
You're talking about the world's
worst judge of character.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.632
I mean, come on,
she's with me, right?

08:27.715 --> 08:30.801
Clare always had this way
of provoking me.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.970
She knows how to press
all my buttons.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.388
Yeah, tell me about it.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.974
So why do you stay with her?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.768
I don't know.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.480
I guess we fit together
in a weird kind of way.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.315
She's very smart.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.651
She's very funny.
I like that about her.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.527
She has no common sense.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.821
I guess that's why she needs me.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.782
Well, that sounds serious.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.951
Serious?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.452
I don't know about serious.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.454
Oh, that'll happen eventually.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.792
{\an1}Hey, man, I'm not even legal
to drink in this country.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.837
{\an4}I still have a few more wild
horny, hormonal oats to sow,
you know what I'm saying.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.507
{\an3}Yeah. I know exactly
what you mean.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.300
{\an3}I've been growing oats
for a while.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.177
I've been meaning
to ask about that.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.180
Isn't there some Princess Grace
waiting in the wings for you.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.848
{\an1}Something to keep that
blue blood flowing.

09:17.932 --> 09:22.311
There's been a, there's been
a couple of near misses.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.729
{\an3}All right, come on,
let's play.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.189
You serve.man.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.316
{\an1}I guess your elusive princess
is still out there, huh?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.111
Yeah, she's still
out there, Steve.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.156
SUSAN:
<i>Can you believe it, Nadine?</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:36.826
How much?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.828
$5,000.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.830
American dollars.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.833
Let me seHere.t sucker.

09:43.916 --> 09:47.003
Lucky Stars, match three.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.671
Yeah, that's five large.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.674
And they say you can't buy a
winning ticket in Beverly Hills.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.843
{\an1}We didn't, we bought
it on campus.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.136
There you go.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.847
You know you have to sign the
back of that to make it legal.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.015
Write small Keats.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.684
{\an4}You've got to leave some
room on there for my
name too, huh?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.185
I am so excited. I don't know
how I'm going to be able

10:03.269 --> 10:04.520
to concentrate on finals.

10:04.603 --> 10:05.688
You'll manage.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.814
So what do you say we go over

10:06.897 --> 10:08.232
to the Valley right now

10:08.316 --> 10:09.984
You want to gor cash?

10:10.067 --> 10:13.696
{\an1}over the hill
No, I want my money.?

10:13.779 --> 10:16.032
{\an3}Well, look, I've got
a final tomorrow at 9:00,

10:16.115 --> 10:18.200
and afterwards, I'll go
over there and cash it.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.037
Unless, of course,
you don't trust me.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.747
Tell you what--

10:22.830 --> 10:23.914
I'll go with you.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.507
(phone ringing)

10:33.591 --> 10:35.843
{\an3}That's probably for you,
like the last three calls.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.887
The wonders of
call forwarding.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.889
Hello.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.098
Hello?

10:43.434 --> 10:44.560
Hello?

10:44.644 --> 10:45.436
Another hang up?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.565
Somebody must have
the wrong number.

10:56.030 --> 10:56.947
Hey.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.409
Hey.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.869
I'm glad you're back.

11:04.121 --> 11:08.000
Being alone is suddenly starting
to freak me out a little bit.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.126
I know.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.713
I can practically
hear the clock.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.632
{\an1}I'm thinking
too much.

11:14.715 --> 11:15.883
Thinking what?

11:15.966 --> 11:17.635
Weird things. You know,

11:17.718 --> 11:20.054
like getting up and...

11:20.137 --> 11:22.056
hightailing it
to Mexico. I don't know.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.600
Colin.

11:24.683 --> 11:25.810
I wouldn't do that.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.061
Oh, good.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.231
I guess I'm still trying

11:30.314 --> 11:31.774
to figure a way out of this.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.443
{\an1}You know?

11:34.527 --> 11:38.155
I keep wondering if I'm gonna
change while I'm in there.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.824
You know, if things
on the outside

11:39.907 --> 11:42.159
are gonna pass me by.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.995
{\an1}What if I
forget things?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.039
Like what the beach
looks like, or...

11:47.123 --> 11:50.626
how fresh strawberries taste.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.378
Or how you feel against me.

12:01.887 --> 12:05.516
{\an1}So, what did you bring
for the last supper?

12:05.599 --> 12:06.809
Don't call it that.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.936
That's what it is.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.986
Well, then let's...

12:17.069 --> 12:18.988
make it a <i> late</i> supper.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.656
A late supper?

12:20.739 --> 12:21.949
Uh-huh.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.169
{\an3}Hey! Are you gonna come
downstairs and study

12:33.252 --> 12:35.671
or have you opted to
do the semester over?

12:35.754 --> 12:36.839
Oh, relax, Clare.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.466
{\an1}You're talking
to a cramming master.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.343
{\an3}Mm-hmm. Which explains
your grade-point average.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.512
Which is up a whole point
this year, thank you very much.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.848
And that's because
you're with me.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.016
Hey, hey, hey!

12:47.099 --> 12:48.309
{\an1}None of that.
Come on.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.685
{\an1}Carl's taking us
out to dinner.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.854
Don't you think we better
put a full night in, here?

12:51.937 --> 12:54.356
{\an1}Nope. At some point, studying
becomes counterproductive.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.733
At least it does for <i> me.</i>

12:55.816 --> 12:57.693
{\an3}Can't you just
say "no" to hNo.

12:57.776 --> 13:01.363
{\an3}You don't know how a
guy like Carl operates.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.823
He goes full-throttle

13:02.907 --> 13:04.492
for what he wants,
when he wants it,

13:04.575 --> 13:05.493
until he gets bored.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.535
I know him.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.536
You <i> knew</i> him.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.537
He's changed.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.830
He's a stand-up guy now.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.042
{\an3}I just don't want you to
be disappointed, okay?

13:13.125 --> 13:15.044
Look, that's not it at all.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.879
He's become a
true friend.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.005
{\an3}That's what

13:18.088 --> 13:19.048
these are all about.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.716
You know what?

13:20.799 --> 13:23.719
<i>These</i> are tokens.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.346
He hands them out
like gumdrops.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.931
{\an3}Tokens don't come
in 18-carat gold, Clare.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.058
In his family, they do.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.228
Well, I like the way
his family does things.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.730
(laughing)

13:41.278 --> 13:42.780
{\an3}Kel!

13:42.863 --> 13:44.532
Hey. Are you back?

13:44.615 --> 13:46.784
{\an1}Mmm. Can't stay at
Mommy's forever.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.369
{\an3}Oh, I wish you would
have called me.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.703
{\an3}I would have
changed my plans.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.913
Oh, that's all right.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.040
Have you seen Valerie around?

13:53.123 --> 13:54.458
No, not really.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.876
I mean, just at the Peach Pit.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.127
How about Colin?

13:57.211 --> 13:59.421
Mmm. Not at all. Why?

13:59.505 --> 14:02.007
Well, he goes to jail tomorrow.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.802
{\an1}He starts serving
his sentence.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.053
Oh...

14:06.136 --> 14:07.137
I didn't know that.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.472
Who did you hear that from?

14:08.556 --> 14:09.890
David.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.058
God.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.351
Jail. That's scary.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.644
Yeah.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.606
I just keep thinking

14:17.690 --> 14:21.443
about how happy we used to be
when he first moved here.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.820
I don't know what happened.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.489
You want me to remind you?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.324
Mmm... not really.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.702
{\an1}But I...

14:29.785 --> 14:32.621
feel like I should
probably call him

14:32.705 --> 14:33.956
and say good-bye or something.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.625
Yeah. Maybe you should call him.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.168
Yeah.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.587
{\an3}But, uh...

14:39.670 --> 14:41.797
after that, you should
close the book on it.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.675
It's not too good to think
about things like that too much,

14:44.758 --> 14:45.926
{\an3}you know?

14:48.095 --> 14:49.013
I'll see you later.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.014
{\an1}Okay.fun.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.056
I'll be at Joe's.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.433
All right.

15:05.904 --> 15:06.822
No.

15:06.905 --> 15:07.823
No?

15:07.906 --> 15:08.824
Come on.
A little more.

15:08.907 --> 15:12.995
(phone ringing)

15:13.078 --> 15:14.288
Want to get that?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.290
Yeah.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.337
Hello?

15:21.420 --> 15:23.839
Valerie. Hi, it's Kelly.

15:23.922 --> 15:24.840
Can I talk to Colin?

15:24.923 --> 15:27.593
What can you possibly
have to say to him?

15:28.927 --> 15:30.846
Just put him on.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.056
I want to say good-bye.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.518
It's Kelly.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.605
She seems to think she deserves
a last conversation with you.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.610
Tell her I can't talk.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.821
I'm sorry, Kelly.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.782
He doesn't want to talk to you.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.219
You know, I've never
won anything before.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.221
You're drifting, Keats.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.764
Right. Sorry.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.851
You know, there's
an article in here

16:17.935 --> 16:19.061
{\an3}about whitewater rafting
on the Colorado River.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.604
{\an3}Best way to see
the Grand Canyon.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.605
What do you think?

16:21.689 --> 16:22.773
Now who's drifting?

16:22.856 --> 16:24.608
I'm not drifting,
I'm rafting.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.445
{\an3}See, rafting. Down the
whitewater Colorado River.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.446
How much is it?

16:29.530 --> 16:30.614
We can afford it.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.199
{\an1}We can afford
a lot of things now.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.701
Yes, we can. We
went from coach

16:33.784 --> 16:35.828
to first-class
in one scratch.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.039
We are gonna have
the greatest trip.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.041
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mmm...

16:41.125 --> 16:42.793
First, we have to get
through finals, okay?

16:42.876 --> 16:43.836
{\an1}Right.

16:43.919 --> 16:44.878
No more Lotto talk.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.215
{\an3}Okay.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.384
I just want to look
at it one more time.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.677
Okay.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.303
Okay.

16:54.972 --> 16:55.889
Come on, gimme.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.057
Very funny.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.225
What? Come on, gimme.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.601
{\an3}Gimme what?
You have the ticket.

16:59.685 --> 17:00.728
<i>You've</i> got the ticket.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.979
<i>You</i> bought it.

17:02.062 --> 17:02.813
And <i> you</i> scratched it.

17:02.896 --> 17:03.939
But then you signed it.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.858
So did you, right after me.

17:05.941 --> 17:06.942
Well, I don't have it.

17:07.025 --> 17:07.651
You don't?

17:07.734 --> 17:08.193
No.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.987
Well, neither do I.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.780
Okay, Keats, this
isn't funny anymore.

17:11.864 --> 17:12.948
Give me the ticket.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.575
I'm not kidding.
I don't have it.

17:14.657 --> 17:15.992
What, are you saying?
It's lost?

17:16.076 --> 17:18.996
Yes. If you don't
have it, it's lost.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.290
Well, I don't have it.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.682
{\an3}Carl, how could you
hate the Dodgers?

17:38.766 --> 17:40.142
{\an6}You don't
know anything
about baseball.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.810
I know a lot.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.313
{\an1}I used to play golf with
Barry Bonds in Montmartre.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.814
He hates the Dodgers.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.274
You played golf with Barry
Bonds? You're kidding me.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.609
Ah, come on!

17:48.692 --> 17:49.818
I played golf with Barry Bonds.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.071
His old man and my old man are
members of the same club.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.157
Moving on...

17:55.240 --> 17:56.617
We boring you, honey?

17:56.700 --> 17:59.286
Oh, wow.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.287
What's this?

18:00.370 --> 18:01.663
They call it a
chocolate swan,

18:01.747 --> 18:02.998
only I had them make it

18:03.081 --> 18:04.166
with a little
<i>Montmartre</i> chocolate.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.501
She used to eat

18:05.584 --> 18:07.795
every piece of chocolate
out of every candy dish

18:07.878 --> 18:09.963
in the palace.
It drove the staff <i> crazy.</i>

18:11.590 --> 18:12.841
Almost as good as sex.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.176
Honey...

18:14.259 --> 18:15.844
So. Steve...

18:15.928 --> 18:17.846
What are we doing
for your 21st birthday?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.182
{\an1}What do you
mean, "uh-oh"?

18:20.265 --> 18:22.059
I'm just throwing Steve
a quiet little party.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.018
You are?

18:23.101 --> 18:23.852
Quiet? How quiet?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.187
I'm not sure.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.522
I'm still thinking about it.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.148
Thinking? Uh...

18:28.232 --> 18:29.316
What are you thinking?

18:29.399 --> 18:32.861
Well, my 21st birthday was
this dreadful state affair,

18:32.945 --> 18:33.862
all pomp and circumstance.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.365
I had to shake hands
with a bunch of old men,

18:36.448 --> 18:38.075
wear a uniform.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.409
{\an1}So, I was
thinking about

18:39.493 --> 18:42.120
throwing <i> you</i> the party
<i>I</i> always wanted to have.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.333
Dude! Prince!

18:46.416 --> 18:48.085
You're welcome.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.295
Excuse me. I have
to hit the bathroom.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.302
So, the prince is getting bored
with me, huh? I don't think so.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.310
Yes...

19:08.438 --> 19:10.440
It's your turn, Donna.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.193
Donna!

19:15.487 --> 19:17.072
It's your turn.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.115
Oh, sorry.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.242
(phone ringing)

19:23.453 --> 19:25.205
Hello.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.206
Yeah. She is.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.375
One moment, please.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.877
It's Erik Budman's
secretary.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.211
{\an1}Yeah.y?

19:31.295 --> 19:33.088
Hello?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.548
Okay. Sure.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.924
It's a conference call.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.552
Hello?

19:38.635 --> 19:40.387
Hi, Erik.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.097
Hi, David.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.473
Mm-hmm.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.767
Yeah, yeah, I've been
listening to them.

19:45.851 --> 19:46.768
Right.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.021
David, what do you think
of the reggae thing?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.025
Mm-hmm. Me, too.

19:53.108 --> 19:53.984
What?

19:54.067 --> 19:55.110
Tomorrow night?

19:55.193 --> 19:56.278
Yeah, sure.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.905
Joe and I'll be there.

19:57.988 --> 19:58.906
Right.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.616
It's a big party tomorrow night.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.493
{\an1}Uh-huh.
Definitely.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.621
{\an1}Okay. Thank you so much
for everything, Erik.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.290
Okay. Bye, David.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.167
You still have exams.
How can you go

20:10.250 --> 20:12.628
Oh, we don't have to stay long.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.339
{\an1}Hey, it's a
business thing,

20:15.422 --> 20:18.216
and I think they're gonna sign
us to produce some more videos.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.927
Well, that's great.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.845
Everything's really falling
into place for you.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.639
It's so cool.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.102
Listen, why don't you
concentrate on your CDs?

20:29.186 --> 20:31.313
I don't think your head's
really in the game anyway.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.484
No. I... I'm sorry, Joe.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.779
Uh... I am totally with you.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.156
Um, whose turn is it?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.325
It's okay, Donna.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.494
You're preoccupied,
and I'm tired.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.996
{\an3}Why don't you
go home?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.456
I'll see you in the morning.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.507
Well, Carl, the evening
was perfect, as usual.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.841
Yes, delicious.

20:59.925 --> 21:00.926
Thank you very much.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.177
MThank you..

21:02.260 --> 21:03.136
But it's got
to stop.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.680
I mean, you're
spoiling us.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.014
When you're as spoiled as I am,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.349
it's no fun unless
you pass it around.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.809
I heard that.

21:08.892 --> 21:09.893
Where're we
going to next?

21:09.977 --> 21:11.812
Home. I have a
final at 8:00.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.271
I don't.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.231
I don't either.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.524
What do you
say, Clare?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.359
You wouldn't mind
if a couple of old pals

21:17.442 --> 21:18.694
go off carousing
together, would you?

21:18.777 --> 21:22.197
{\an1}No, not if Steve
drives me home first.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.532
He won't let me
drive his car.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.075
Oh, no, it's okay.
You can drive it.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.368
Will you take me home, later?

21:26.451 --> 21:27.995
Come on, honey.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.163
Well, this is a first.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.207
So where you boys
gonna go?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.876
I was thinking...
a local gentlemen's club.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.878
A gentlemen's club?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.714
What? You mean,
like strippers?

21:38.797 --> 21:40.674
No, no. Strictly
cognac and cigars.

21:40.757 --> 21:41.717
And strippers.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.843
Mmm.

21:42.926 --> 21:43.510
Good night, Clare.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.220
Good night.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.471
Don't let him convince you

21:46.555 --> 21:49.891
his diplomatic credentials are
gonna get you out of jail, okay?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.852
Okay. Good night.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.729
{\an3}Sleep tight,
okay?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.902
She's the greatest.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.362
She <i> is.</i> ou.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.989
The best.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.954
(sighs)

22:19.463 --> 22:23.925
I never wanted time to stand
still more than I do right now.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.261
I know.

22:27.804 --> 22:31.558
The moment of truth...

22:31.641 --> 22:33.435
it came and found me, huh?

22:35.645 --> 22:37.230
We've really got to go.

22:43.236 --> 22:45.614
Yeah, I know.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.454
You want to drive?

22:54.247 --> 22:56.124
Yeah...

22:56.208 --> 22:59.002
Yeah, that'd be nice.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.215
Come on.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.977
{\an1}I still say it's
in your dorm room.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.187
{\an3}I still say it's
back in your house.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.730
Can we at least
agree on this,

23:18.814 --> 23:20.649
{\an1}this is the last place
Any luck?, right?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.317
None whatsoever.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.277
Trash.... we need to
look in your trash.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.823
Yesterday's trash-- it's already
bagged and taken out.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.991
You're welcome
to visit my Dumpster.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.368
(groans)

23:33.912 --> 23:37.958
Hey, Brando, yesterday's lunch
should be about halfway down.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.340
Over there to your left
by the coffee grounds.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.801
{\an1}I'm following a trail of
French fries right now, honey.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.682
What? What was that?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.017
It was either a live potato
or a rat.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.186
Brandon, how could you do this?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.230
I'm sorry.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.358
And when was it that we figured
out I'm the culprit here?

24:03.442 --> 24:05.318
You bought the
stupid ticket last.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.529
Why don't you
Because then I'd be lying.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.198
{\an3}Oh, so you're calling
me a liar now?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.200
{\an1}No, honey, I'm calling
you mistaken.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.036
I never should have gone 50-50
with you in the first place.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.123
You know, if this was a 50-50
deal, you'd be in here with me.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.208
I'm out of here.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.085
You can't quit now.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.337
{\an1}Give it up, Susan.
It's gone.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.381
I don't want to give
it up. It's $5,000.

24:26.464 --> 24:29.050
That's right, it's $5,000 and
I wanted to cash it yesterday,

24:29.134 --> 24:30.802
{\an1}but heaven forbid
you'd listen to me!

24:30.886 --> 24:32.012
If I'd listened to you,
we never would've

24:32.095 --> 24:33.096
bought the ticket
in the first place.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.390
That's right. We never would
have bought the ticket.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.350
You can't stop now.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.103
I just did.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.734
Great.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.538
You okay?

24:58.622 --> 25:01.416
I feel nauseous.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.544
Well, we're late.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.213
{\an3}Listen, will you
do me a favor

25:06.296 --> 25:07.797
and go find my lawyer.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.132
I'll park.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.636
Yeah, yeah,
I'll meet you inside.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.140
You're going to be all right.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.145
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be okay.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.946
(engine starting)

26:00.392 --> 26:02.435
(tires squealing)

26:07.899 --> 26:11.278
{\an1}So, how long does it take
to park the damn car?

26:11.361 --> 26:12.988
I don't know.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.657
I don't understand this.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.160
Do we have a problem here?

26:19.244 --> 26:22.706
Yeah... yeah, I guess we do.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.806
Set...

26:39.889 --> 26:41.182
{\an1}go!

26:48.273 --> 26:49.566
Yes, 4.8.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.693
That's amazing!

26:51.776 --> 26:53.236
Up from a 4.9?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.030
{\an1}Donna, that's nowhere
near amazing.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.866
I ran a 4.6-40 last year.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.492
{\an3}Joe, you just
had heart surgery.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.702
Give yourself a break.

27:00.785 --> 27:04.372
Yeah, I know, but I can't keep
on using that excuse forever.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.999
I either cut it or I don't.

27:06.082 --> 27:07.876
I think I've had
enough for today.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.002
Are you sure?

27:09.085 --> 27:11.046
You know what, maybe you
should give it another shot.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.548
What, get more depressed?
No, thanks.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.091
Ever heard of try again?

27:15.175 --> 27:16.926
Come on, I know you can do it.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.971
Donna, would you quit it
with the rah-rah routine?

27:20.055 --> 27:23.808
{\an1}You don't need to be my
cheerleader all the time.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.439
Oh, God, what am I doing?

27:29.522 --> 27:32.067
I'm sorry.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.068
I'm sorry, babe.

27:33.151 --> 27:36.029
I'm sorry, babe.

27:41.659 --> 27:44.245
The good news is
your car's been recovered.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.748
The not-so-good news is we still
have a fugitive at large.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.084
How much cash
did he have?

27:49.167 --> 27:51.419
I have no idea.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.421
He mention anything to you about
doing something like this?

27:53.505 --> 27:54.589
No.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.007
Look, a lot of times

27:56.091 --> 27:59.719
these rabbits come back
within 24 hours.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.429
They get cold feet, you know.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.264
{\an3}If your boyfriend turns
himself in quickly,

28:03.348 --> 28:06.101
you don't have a problem,
we'll let it go.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.936
But the longer
he stays out there,

28:08.019 --> 28:09.562
the worse it's going to be
on him.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.314
I understand.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.108
{\an3}CRANE:
And, uh, you'll let us know

28:13.191 --> 28:14.067
if anything comes up?

28:14.150 --> 28:15.944
You'll be the first one I call.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.153
{\an1}CARR:
We better cross our fingers.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.198
I don't want to have to work
too hard to get my bond back.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.449
And I certainly don't

28:21.533 --> 28:23.159
want to run a nightclub.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.955
Look, I've never needed
good legal advice

28:27.038 --> 28:28.415
as much as I do now.

28:28.498 --> 28:33.962
Yeah, well, two words--
find Colin.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.686
(techno-pop playing loudly)

29:17.964 --> 29:21.509
Man, every A&amp;R rep in the
city must be here tonight.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.386
This is so exciting.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.016
{\an3}Have you guys
tried the dim sum?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.350
{\an3}It's amazing.
Here, Donna, try it.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.229
{\an3}Mm. Mm,
that's good.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.981
{\an3}Erik, this is my
boyfriend, Joe Bradley.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.192
Yeah. The quarterback.
I've been to a couple of games.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.359
You're great.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.778
{\an1}I can't wait for
Thanks.ason.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.405
{\an1}Hey, so we listened
to the stuff you gave us

29:42.489 --> 29:44.365
{\an1}and we have some
Great. We'll talk tomorrow.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.035
Are you the C.U. quarterback,
Joe Bradley?

29:47.118 --> 29:48.912
Yeah.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.873
Boy, this is embarrassing,
but I'm a C.U. alum

29:51.956 --> 29:54.292
and a glutton for football,
thus, your biggest fan.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.002
{\an1}That's very nice of you.
Thank you.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.796
I'm telling you,
I never miss a game.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.549
Hi, I'm Donna.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.384
Sophie Tyler.
I'm with Warner Records.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.385
David.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.095
How ya doing, Erik?

30:06.179 --> 30:07.138
Getting my share.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.640
Sophie, you're looking

30:08.723 --> 30:10.099
{\an3}at the two new hottest
video producers in town.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.560
{\an1}DAVID:
Come on, you guys.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.063
There's somebody I want
you to meet from Atlantic.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.066
Oh, you're bad. us, Sophie.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.235
You're going to play us up
against each other

30:20.318 --> 30:22.529
{\an3}Hey, I told you.
for They're the best.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.076
So when does practice start?

30:28.159 --> 30:30.203
Real soon.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.080
I'll never forget that bomb
you threw against USC

30:32.163 --> 30:34.374
in the last ten seconds.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.591
KELLY:
<i>There's no coffee in the house.</i>

30:43.675 --> 30:45.593
Finals.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.679
{\an3}I'm going to go get
some, all rYeah.

30:49.013 --> 30:52.100
(knocking on door)

30:52.183 --> 30:54.102
Well, you're not Clare.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.437
You must be Donna or Kelly.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.855
I'm Kelly.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.816
You must be Prince Carl?

30:59.899 --> 31:01.067
Yes.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.611
I'm sorry, I don't know
the protocol.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.612
(chuckles)

31:04.696 --> 31:05.613
You invite me in.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.156
Ah, come in.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.617
Clare, you have company.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.119
I'm going to the market.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.954
{\an3}Carl, what're you
doing here?

31:13.037 --> 31:14.622
Sorry to come
unannounced.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.958
{\an3}That's okay.
Is something wrong?

31:17.041 --> 31:18.126
No, I hope not.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.336
Not if you let me
give you this.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.130
What is this for?

31:22.213 --> 31:24.132
Well, I gave Steve
cufflinks so...

31:24.215 --> 31:25.300
Oh, you didn't have
to do this.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.467
{\an1}Consider it
a payback, Clare,

31:26.551 --> 31:28.720
for all the frogs I put
down your dress,

31:28.803 --> 31:29.804
the spiders I squashed

31:29.887 --> 31:30.847
in your sandwiches,

31:30.930 --> 31:34.142
{\an1}the torture that I inflicted
on your doll collection.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.311
You put spiders
in my sandwiches?

31:36.394 --> 31:38.855
Just open it.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.776
Oh, my God!

31:43.860 --> 31:46.112
They're so beautiful.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.196
{\an1}You've turned into a
beautiful woman, Clare.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.531
{\an1}I wanted you to have
something special.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.285
Here, let me put
them on for you.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.162
Steve's on his way over.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.456
And we are all going out.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.124
{\an3}Oh, I have to
study, actually.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.834
Where, where did
you want to go?

31:59.917 --> 32:02.170
{\an1}I just want to take a little
ride down to Long Beach

32:02.253 --> 32:03.630
{\an1}and check out something
for Steve's party.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.173
Long Beach? Why?

32:05.256 --> 32:06.549
You'll see.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.469
(phOne sec.s)

32:09.552 --> 32:10.845
Hello.

32:10.928 --> 32:12.138
Hey, I'm running late, baby.
I'm sorry.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.181
That's okay. No problem.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.390
Is Carl there?

32:14.474 --> 32:15.642
Yeah, right here.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.226
Did he tell you
where we're going?

32:17.310 --> 32:18.811
Hmm, Long Beach.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.021
Yeah, yeah, Long Beach.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.064
Anything else?

32:21.147 --> 32:23.399
No, why? What's going on?

32:23.483 --> 32:25.568
I don't know.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.488
I guess we'll have
to be surprised.

32:28.571 --> 32:29.739
{\an3}Yeah. How long are
you going to be?

32:29.822 --> 32:32.784
I'm hurrying as fast as I can.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.410
(yelling)

32:34.494 --> 32:37.205
(groans)

32:37.288 --> 32:38.498
Steve?

32:38.581 --> 32:39.707
{\an3}Hello?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.877
(mumbling):
I'm hurt...

32:42.960 --> 32:44.212
I'm really hurt...

32:46.005 --> 32:47.882
Oh, Clare...

32:47.965 --> 32:51.386
(techno-pop playing)

32:51.469 --> 32:54.639
Having a good Yeah.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.432
No, you're not.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.726
{\an1}This is not really
my scene, that's all.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.062
Well, we'll leave soon, okay?

33:01.145 --> 33:02.939
No, you're not leaving, and I'm
not going to ask you to.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.441
This is your night.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.026
But you want to leave?

33:08.486 --> 33:10.363
Yes, yes, you do.

33:10.446 --> 33:14.075
Look, Donna, I'm not trying
to put a damper on your evening,

33:14.158 --> 33:16.077
I'm really not.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.745
{\an1}This is just one
of those situations

33:17.829 --> 33:20.248
where you feel right
at home and I feel...

33:20.331 --> 33:21.582
out of it.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.752
{\an1}I'm the square root of one,
what can I tell you?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.254
Absolutely.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.505
Yes, you are.

33:27.588 --> 33:28.715
But I still love you.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.093
We'll leave after
this song, okay?

33:32.176 --> 33:33.052
Okay.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.937
{\an1}Hey, I've got something cool
for you guys.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.272
Nothing definite,
but I should know this week.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.773
Great.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.066
{\an1}Just the beginning,
my friend.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.651
Well, we're ready.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.237
So what's with Donna and Joe?

33:51.320 --> 33:52.280
{\an1}Are they, like, engaged
or something?

33:52.363 --> 33:55.241
Nah, nah, they've just been
dating for a while.

33:55.324 --> 33:56.951
Interesting.

33:57.034 --> 33:59.162
{\an3}She's really beautiful,
don't you think?

33:59.245 --> 34:01.956
Yeah, she is.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.219
{\an3}Kelly?

34:16.512 --> 34:17.804
Colin, what are you doing here?

34:17.889 --> 34:21.184
I've been waiting for you.

34:21.266 --> 34:24.978
I was scared to knock.

34:25.062 --> 34:26.938
Can I come in?

34:27.023 --> 34:29.942
No. I don't think that'd be
a very good idea.

34:30.025 --> 34:33.029
I need somebody to talk to...

34:33.112 --> 34:35.114
just for a few minutes.

34:35.197 --> 34:38.951
Weren't you supposed to turn
yourself in today?

34:39.034 --> 34:41.204
Yeah.

34:45.875 --> 34:46.958
I need a friend.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.297
I ran.

34:52.380 --> 34:56.219
Look, you shouldn't be here.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.137
I can't help you.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.639
Then why did you call me?

34:59.722 --> 35:01.307
Because I wanted
to say good-bye,

35:01.390 --> 35:04.060
but you wouldn't take it.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.062
You still care about me?

35:06.145 --> 35:09.357
No.

35:11.317 --> 35:14.195
Not... not in that way.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.993
I don't know where to go
from here.

35:21.077 --> 35:26.582
Do I turn myself in?

35:26.666 --> 35:29.544
Do I keep running? What...?

35:32.171 --> 35:34.715
What do I do?

35:34.799 --> 35:38.553
You're gonna have to figure it
out for yourself.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.972
I don't have any answers
for you.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.140
{\an1}Look,

35:43.224 --> 35:45.768
I won't tell anybody
that you came here,

35:45.852 --> 35:47.311
but don't come again.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.315
You're on your own, Colin.

36:17.717 --> 36:18.885
{\an3}CLARE:
Okay, what's it gonna be?

36:18.968 --> 36:22.263
{\an3}Soup through a straw
or a milkshake?

36:22.346 --> 36:23.890
(mumbling)

36:23.973 --> 36:25.600
{\an3}What?

36:25.683 --> 36:27.435
Mm... he's not hungry.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.936
{\an3}NAT:
Oh, boy.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.813
What happened?

36:30.897 --> 36:32.940
He fell down the stairs.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.108
His jaw's wired shut.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.902
Oh, so the news
ain't all bad, huh?

36:35.985 --> 36:38.654
Can you get him

36:38.738 --> 36:39.655
some soup or something?

36:39.739 --> 36:40.907
Sure, honey.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.285
Relax, pal,
you're gonna be all right.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.786
♪ Better tell me
that I'm pretty... ♪

36:45.870 --> 36:48.247
Steve, I want you to stay
at the Beverly Hills Hotel

36:48.331 --> 36:49.290
for a couple of nights.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.125
{\an3}It's on me.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.919
{\an3}I'll have somebody
take care

36:53.002 --> 36:53.878
of whatever you need.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.338
Just till you start feeling
a little better.

36:55.421 --> 36:58.007
(mumbling)

36:58.090 --> 36:59.258
Oh, that's sweet.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.010
(mumbling)

37:01.093 --> 37:03.429
What is he saying?

37:03.512 --> 37:04.805
{\an3}I think he

37:04.889 --> 37:06.098
considers it a good idea.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.975
(laughs)

37:08.059 --> 37:09.268
See, Steve,
I can understand you.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.228
Mm-mm.

37:10.311 --> 37:13.230
So, uh, when did you become
such a nice guy?

37:13.314 --> 37:16.317
Just like in the fairy tales;
from a frog to a prince.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.111
(pained grunting)

37:20.780 --> 37:22.782
I give up.

37:22.865 --> 37:24.367
I think he's in

37:24.450 --> 37:25.368
pain, Clare.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.495
Oh...

37:27.578 --> 37:29.830
{\an3}poor baby.
You okay?

37:29.914 --> 37:32.500
(whimpeOh...

37:32.583 --> 37:34.835
(knocking on door)

37:34.919 --> 37:36.712
Hi, Mom. Where's Mel?

37:36.796 --> 37:39.423
{\an1}Oh, he took Erin to see <i> Babe</i>
for the hundredth time.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.841
{\an1}I didn't even hear
you come in.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.385
I brought you a present.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.512
{\an3}It's all the yummy
stuff you like

37:44.595 --> 37:46.722
that I used up while
I was staying here.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.057
You didn't have to.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.851
You know, maybe I shouldn't have
moved back

37:50.935 --> 37:52.436
to my apartment so soon.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.731
Guess who showed up
on my doorstep last night?

37:55.815 --> 37:56.691
Who?

37:56.774 --> 37:58.025
Colin.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.736
He's supposed
to be going to jail,

38:00.820 --> 38:02.196
but he didn't feel like it.

38:02.279 --> 38:03.489
Excuse me?

38:03.572 --> 38:04.490
{\an3}He bolted.

38:04.573 --> 38:05.866
Didn't turn himself in.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.743
I must be on the road
to recovery

38:07.827 --> 38:10.037
because I did not even ask him
to come in.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.872
Good for you.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.874
I don't think I'd make a very
good fugitive, anyway.

38:13.958 --> 38:18.045
Honey, I'm so grateful
he's out of your life.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.339
Me, too.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.055
Oh, what a night.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.890
Yeah, tell me about it.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.226
{\an3}I had the
worst on record.

38:32.309 --> 38:33.227
I challenge that.

38:33.310 --> 38:35.396
{\an3}Okay.

38:35.479 --> 38:39.191
I lost $5,000,
I had a huge fight with Susan,

38:39.275 --> 38:41.569
and our dream trip is cancelled
before it even started.

38:41.652 --> 38:44.238
Well, I may lose a hundred
thousand dollars.

38:44.321 --> 38:46.073
Colin was supposed to turn
himself in yesterday.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.867
He drove off
and didn't come back.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.705
I think you have me beat.

38:52.788 --> 38:53.956
Yeah.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.249
{\an3}You okay?

38:55.332 --> 38:56.584
I'm a little numb.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.919
But I think I'm gonna take
a long walk

38:59.003 --> 39:00.421
and forget about it for a while.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.466
Sounds like a good idea.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.051
I'm really sorry.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.427
Yeah, me, too.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.221
Listen, can I borrow this, huh?

39:09.305 --> 39:10.806
Sure, I won't be needing it.

39:12.975 --> 39:15.269
{\an1}Is that what
I think it is?

39:15.352 --> 39:17.271
Yes, it is.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.815
Now if I could only find
Colin that easily.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.401
(sniffing)

39:22.485 --> 39:23.944
(sighs)

39:24.028 --> 39:26.447
DONNA:
Hey, Joe. Hi.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.699
{\an1}Hi.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.701
How was your workout?

39:30.785 --> 39:32.161
{\an1}Actually,
I slept in today.

39:32.244 --> 39:33.913
You did?
How come?

39:33.996 --> 39:34.955
I don't know.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.918
{\an1}Yesterday, last night,
it just all kind of got to me.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.503
What? What did?

39:40.586 --> 39:43.172
Things are going bad enough
for me on the field.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.174
But last night the only thing
that anyone wanted

39:45.257 --> 39:46.759
to talk to me about
was football.

39:46.842 --> 39:49.095
Yeah, so?

39:49.178 --> 39:51.972
{\an1}Any time that I meet someone
new, that's what happens.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.766
It's like my whole identity

39:53.849 --> 39:54.934
is wrapped around
being a quarterback.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.436
Well, it's a high-profile
position.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.771
It goes with the territory.

39:58.854 --> 40:01.690
What if I didn't have
football anymore?

40:01.774 --> 40:05.986
What would I do?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.280
{\an1}Don't you think
I should find out, Donna?

40:08.364 --> 40:10.032
I'm not sure running a 4.6 40

40:10.116 --> 40:12.076
is the most important thing
in my life anymore.

40:16.914 --> 40:20.334
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

40:20.417 --> 40:22.211
What has gotten into you?

40:22.294 --> 40:24.922
I don't know.

40:25.005 --> 40:28.008
But I'll let you know
when I find out.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.894
Walsh, get in here.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.938
This better be good.

40:47.570 --> 40:51.866
Listen, I would like to
apologize for yesterday.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.868
{\an3}I don't know what
got into me.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.203
I'm not usually like that
with money.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.205
It was just the thought
of having won

40:58.289 --> 41:00.541
and then letting it slip through
my fingers and...

41:00.624 --> 41:01.750
it just made me crazy.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.002
I wish I'd never

41:03.085 --> 41:05.713
went in on that stupid ticket
with you in the first place.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.506
Oh, really?

41:07.590 --> 41:10.718
Then I guess you won't be
wanting half of this?

41:10.801 --> 41:11.886
Ah! Where'd you find it?

41:11.969 --> 41:13.679
{\an1}It was in one
of our travel magazines.

41:13.762 --> 41:14.597
You're kidding?

41:14.680 --> 41:16.891
No, this ticket has been nothing
but grief.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.144
{\an1}I'd rather lose the five grand
then lose you over it.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.567
Oh...

41:26.650 --> 41:28.068
Brandon, what got into us?

41:28.152 --> 41:31.489
I think it's called greed.

41:31.572 --> 41:34.575
Hmm. Still, there's no sense
in throwing away money.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.744
We should do something
really good with it.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.037
You're right.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.248
I'm sure there's some charity
around that could use $5,000.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.753
Mm-hmm. Oh, well,
how about this?

41:45.836 --> 41:46.754
A family of six,

41:46.837 --> 41:49.089
their house burned to the ground
in Boyle Heights.

41:49.173 --> 41:52.218
A local shelter is handling
their case and all inquiries.

41:52.301 --> 41:54.470
Not bad.

41:54.553 --> 42:00.100
We could go and cash in this
ticket and give 'em the money.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.477
What do you think?

42:01.560 --> 42:04.772
I think I love you.

42:04.855 --> 42:07.858
I think I love you, too.

42:13.906 --> 42:16.742
(doorbell rings)

42:19.161 --> 42:20.746
{\an1}Hey.

42:20.829 --> 42:22.665
Can I come in?

42:22.748 --> 42:24.708
I suppose so.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.920
{\an1}Look, I know you
don't owe me any favors,

42:28.003 --> 42:29.672
but I need your help.

42:29.755 --> 42:30.756
{\an3}With what?

42:30.839 --> 42:32.424
I'm looking for Colin.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.968
I'm sure you heard
about his disappearing act.

42:34.051 --> 42:35.302
Yeah, I heard.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.263
But I don't know anything else
about it.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.139
Well, you called him. I thought
maybe he'd call you back.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.432
No.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.600
Or maybe he came by here
in person?

42:41.684 --> 42:42.977
Wrong again.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.019
Are you sure?

42:44.103 --> 42:45.771
Yes, I'm sure.

42:45.854 --> 42:47.815
Then why are you getting
so defensive?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.652
Oh, I get it.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.863
He came by here to tell you that
he still loved you, didn't he?

42:54.947 --> 42:55.781
I don't have to answer that.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.491
I don't have to answer
anything you ask.

42:57.574 --> 42:58.492
Kelly, believe me,

42:58.576 --> 43:00.661
you're the last person
I'd come to for help.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.665
I may lose my club, I may lose
everything that I've worked for.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.750
{\an1}Please,
if you know anything...

43:06.834 --> 43:08.335
I hope he runs and runs.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.511
{\an1}This was a mistake
coming here.

43:17.594 --> 43:18.887
Then do yourself a favor.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.347
Don't make
the same mistake twice.
