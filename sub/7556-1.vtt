God, Stone, how long you think

18:17.553 --> 18:19.655

22:10.186 --> 22:11.653
- Hello. May I help you?
- Yes.

22:11.655 --> 22:15.626
I'm Trisha Sinclair. I have an
appointment with District Attorney Johnson.

22:18.094 --> 22:22.129
I'm sorry. I don't have any
appointments with that name.

22:22.131 --> 22:24.866
Unfortunately, I had to
bump that appointment.

22:24.868 --> 22:28.002
Hello, Miss Sinclair. Mark Crane.

22:28.004 --> 22:30.271
Mr. Johnson wasn't able to
accommodate you, so I had to cancel.

22:30.273 --> 22:32.139
With no phone call to let me know?

22:32.141 --> 22:34.276
I apologize for that. But
if you just step over here...

22:34.278 --> 22:36.578
I'm sorry. When is he available?

22:36.580 --> 22:39.114
I think it would be
best if you met with me.

22:39.116 --> 22:41.816
Then I can give that information to
Mr. Johnson when he <i>is</i> available.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.984
- I didn't ask to speak with you...
- Please hold my calls.

22:43.986 --> 22:46.356
- Yes, Mr. Crane.
- Thank you.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.595
Look, the information you left
with Mr. Johnson was relayed to me.

22:53.597 --> 22:55.996
Jack Stone is a closed case.

22:55.998 --> 22:58.700
This isn't just about Jack Stone.

22:58.702 --> 23:00.167
Well, then, any information you have,

23:00.169 --> 23:02.169
I'd be more than happy to pass it along.

23:02.171 --> 23:05.308
So if you give it to me, I'll
make sure that he gets it.

23:06.076 --> 23:08.245
I'll just reschedule.

23:16.852 --> 23:19.354
I don't know. Principals
in your schools around here

23:19.356 --> 23:21.790
that I'm kind of investigating...

23:21.792 --> 23:23.924
Excuse me, District Attorney Johnson.

23:23.926 --> 23:26.694
I'm so sorry to interrupt, but
I really need to speak with you.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.963
- And you are?
- Trisha Sinclair.

23:28.965 --> 23:31.732
Oh. The reporter from the <i>Post.</i>

23:31.734 --> 23:34.269
- George, can I get back with you a little bit later?
- You got it.

23:34.271 --> 23:36.070
Thank you.

23:36.072 --> 23:38.205
So, Miss Sinclair, what
is so terribly important

23:38.207 --> 23:40.774
that I had to cut short my
conversation with the mayor?

23:40.776 --> 23:42.344
That was the mayor?

23:42.346 --> 23:44.779
- Didn't you recognize him?
- I voted for the other guy.

23:44.781 --> 23:46.748
- Oh.
- I'm so sorry.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.117
I made an appointment with you,
but your guard dog canceled it.

23:49.119 --> 23:51.019
(chuckles) Well, that's Mark.

23:51.021 --> 23:52.886
See, he hasn't been with me very long,

23:52.888 --> 23:56.625
- and he tends to be a little overly protective.
- Yeah.

23:56.627 --> 23:58.693
- Can we walk and talk?
- Yeah.

23:58.695 --> 24:01.061
Okay. So, what's this all about?

24:01.063 --> 24:03.030
Jack Stone and Balam Mogilevich.

24:03.032 --> 24:04.866
Ah. Balam?

24:04.868 --> 24:07.167
Well, he's been in jail for years.

24:07.169 --> 24:09.337
The same prison that
Jack Stone was sent to.

24:09.339 --> 24:10.905
And?

24:10.907 --> 24:13.174
I don't think it was by coincidence.

24:13.176 --> 24:15.143
Before killing his ex-partner,

24:15.145 --> 24:18.312
Jack Stone was part of a three-man
crew that robbed the Orleans bank,

24:18.314 --> 24:20.915
which many believe to be a
front for the Russian mob.

24:20.917 --> 24:24.918
Well, that was never confirmed,
not that it's not true.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.187
Accusations without proof...

24:27.189 --> 24:28.956
I may have proof.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.825
Lots of it.

24:30.827 --> 24:33.194
What if Jack and Balam
are working together?

24:33.196 --> 24:35.363
A city detective in bed
with the Russian mob?

24:35.365 --> 24:38.767
(chuckles) I think it's a little more
complicated than that, Miss Sinclair.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.934
Well, it makes sense if you think about it.

24:40.936 --> 24:43.070
Why didn't Jack get the death penalty?

24:43.072 --> 24:45.173
He killed a police officer.

24:45.175 --> 24:47.207
But... It's not just Jack.

24:47.209 --> 24:49.344
I have a whole list of names.

24:49.346 --> 24:52.047
- Don't worry. Your name didn't come up.
- (chuckles)

24:52.049 --> 24:54.883
Well, police corruption,

24:54.885 --> 24:59.287
that poses a fundamental threat to
our security, our very way of life.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.989
It impacts everything,

25:00.991 --> 25:03.090
from how we protect our neighborhoods

25:03.092 --> 25:05.260
and verdicts handed down in the courts.

25:05.262 --> 25:09.030
If you have information, I think
you should come forward with it.

25:09.032 --> 25:11.031
I plan to.

25:11.033 --> 25:14.069
I just wanna make sure I understand
everything before I present the evidence.

25:14.071 --> 25:16.070
Good. Good.

25:16.072 --> 25:18.839
Well, let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

25:18.841 --> 25:20.174
Will do.

25:20.176 --> 25:22.178
Here's my direct number.

25:23.013 --> 25:26.782
You don't have to worry about Mark Crane.

25:39.262 --> 25:41.498
(cell door opens)

25:42.198 --> 25:44.700
Stone, you have a visitor.

26:00.917 --> 26:03.486
Hello, Mr. Stone.

26:03.786 --> 26:05.953
Miss Sinclair.

26:05.955 --> 26:08.455
I've been looking forward to your visit.

26:08.457 --> 26:10.457
How do you know who I am?

26:10.459 --> 26:13.696
What are you gonna do with
the information I sent you?

26:14.830 --> 26:16.667
That was you?

26:18.534 --> 26:20.367
What do you want?

26:20.369 --> 26:22.870
Use the information, Miss Sinclair.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.640
(handset settles in cradle)

26:27.077 --> 26:28.878
(door opens)

26:30.379 --> 26:32.416
(door closes)

26:34.117 --> 26:36.049
(fingers snap)

26:36.051 --> 26:39.052
William. Come on.

26:39.054 --> 26:41.790
You're like a walking roadblock.

26:41.792 --> 26:44.360
Move! (chuckles)

27:00.443 --> 27:03.614
- Mmm. Hey.
- Hi.

27:04.814 --> 27:06.749
WOMAN: <i>Happy birthday.</i>

27:09.218 --> 27:11.251
Because you are my anchor,

27:11.253 --> 27:14.923
and no matter how rough
the seas of life get,

27:14.925 --> 27:17.594
I know that you will
always be there for me.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.931
- <i>I love you.</i>
- STONE: <i>I love you.</i>

27:35.145 --> 27:37.314
(knocking)

27:39.282 --> 27:43.017
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

27:43.019 --> 27:45.856
Are you... you Jack Stone?

27:46.455 --> 27:48.223
Thanks for your help earlier.

27:48.225 --> 27:50.660
What do you mean?

27:52.561 --> 27:54.563
Never mind.

27:59.269 --> 28:01.368
I'm William.

28:01.370 --> 28:03.271
Pretty important around here.

28:03.273 --> 28:05.940
When there's blood to be
cleaned up off the floors,

28:05.942 --> 28:08.542
I'm the one they call.

28:08.544 --> 28:12.081
You can imagine this
place keeps me pretty busy.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.986
You know Balam?

28:18.455 --> 28:20.053
Yes.

28:20.055 --> 28:22.423
Yeah, everybody's afraid of him.

28:22.425 --> 28:24.157
Semyon's his cousin.

28:24.159 --> 28:26.226
You pushed his face into the...

28:26.228 --> 28:28.631
I know who Semyon is.

28:30.367 --> 28:32.836
But you're not afraid of Balam?

28:33.570 --> 28:35.605
No.

28:38.574 --> 28:40.908
You know where Balam's cell is?

28:40.910 --> 28:44.044
Everybody knows where it
is, but nobody goes there,

28:44.046 --> 28:45.946
not even the guards.

28:45.948 --> 28:47.984
Well, the good ones anyway.

28:55.058 --> 28:56.590
I like your bracelet.

28:56.592 --> 28:59.426
Were you in the navy?

28:59.428 --> 29:02.099
It was a gift from my wife.

29:04.434 --> 29:06.436
She's gone now.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.103
(sighs)

29:09.105 --> 29:12.409
That's sad. I'm sorry.

29:31.660 --> 29:34.830
Ha, ha! (yells)

29:35.732 --> 29:38.667
(women clamoring)

29:43.106 --> 29:46.042
(alarm blaring)

29:55.185 --> 29:57.854
Get off me! Don't touch me!

30:04.727 --> 30:07.462
Hold up. I'll take her from here.

30:07.464 --> 30:10.066
You two are needed in "D" block.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.769
Come on, honey.

30:14.704 --> 30:16.771
Isn't solitary the other way?

30:16.773 --> 30:18.841
Shut your face.

30:25.215 --> 30:27.647
Cousin, why am I here? Everything is fine.

30:27.649 --> 30:31.752
There are three reasons why
I choose to live in a prison.

30:31.754 --> 30:35.455
Protection from my many enemies.

30:35.457 --> 30:38.760
It provides a blind spot

30:38.762 --> 30:42.797
to keep my many business dealings
off the government's radar.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.265
And finally,

30:45.267 --> 30:47.102
control.

30:47.704 --> 30:50.203
Control means power.

30:50.205 --> 30:52.141
It means order.

30:52.775 --> 30:54.674
Control means respect.

30:54.676 --> 30:56.511
I know all this!

30:56.513 --> 30:59.480
Nothing happens in this prison

30:59.482 --> 31:01.685
without my approval.

31:02.351 --> 31:04.385
When someone takes it upon themselves

31:04.387 --> 31:08.289
to operate on their own volition,

31:08.291 --> 31:11.127
that shows me disrespect.

31:14.230 --> 31:17.298
I do not tolerate disrespect,

31:17.300 --> 31:19.500
even from my own cousin.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.705
I would never disre... (muffled shouting)

31:22.671 --> 31:26.074
Taking a percentage of inmates' goods

31:26.076 --> 31:28.809
without my permission...

31:28.811 --> 31:31.013
disrespectful.

31:32.514 --> 31:36.451
Setting up drug deals, both
in and out of these walls,

31:36.453 --> 31:38.853
behind my back?

31:38.855 --> 31:40.788
Very disrespectful.

31:40.790 --> 31:43.191
- (groans)
- (body thuds)

31:43.193 --> 31:47.228
Trying to kill Jack
Stone and take credit...

31:47.230 --> 31:49.730
that is very disrespectful.

31:49.732 --> 31:51.768
(groans)

32:03.312 --> 32:05.646
Such a shame.

32:05.648 --> 32:09.884
Your face is the mixture
of beauty and tragedy.

32:09.886 --> 32:14.288
- (muffled shouting)
- Like Vasily Perov painting.

32:14.290 --> 32:18.994
Why would you risk damaging
something so priceless?

32:21.563 --> 32:26.101
You must know Katherina
is under my employment.

32:26.836 --> 32:30.504
That means she is also...

32:30.506 --> 32:32.975
under my protection.

32:35.344 --> 32:38.212
So when you are fighting Katherina,

32:38.214 --> 32:41.449
you are also fighting me.

32:41.451 --> 32:44.955
Do you wish to make me your enemy?

32:47.456 --> 32:51.360
Because if you care so little...

32:52.594 --> 32:55.631
for something so beautiful,

32:56.799 --> 33:01.368
perhaps you do not deserve it.

33:01.370 --> 33:06.807
I will take it and place it on my wall,

33:06.809 --> 33:10.879
where it will not be abused by you.

33:12.182 --> 33:14.618
(gasps, coughs)

33:18.521 --> 33:20.788
(gasping)

33:20.790 --> 33:23.890
You represent me in
all that you do, Cousin.

33:23.892 --> 33:27.328
Your failure to kill Jack Stone

33:27.330 --> 33:30.000
becomes <i>my</i> failure.

33:30.733 --> 33:34.268
And in the eyes of the other inmates,

33:34.270 --> 33:36.205
that shows weakness.

33:36.705 --> 33:40.374
Weakness leads to dissonance,

33:40.376 --> 33:43.311
which can quickly turn to revolt.

33:43.313 --> 33:46.646
Please, Cousin, give me a second
chance. I won't let you down.

33:46.648 --> 33:48.715
No.

33:48.717 --> 33:52.552
Jack Stone's defiance cannot go unanswered.

33:52.554 --> 33:54.924
I need you both to spread the word.

33:55.657 --> 33:59.259
One hundred thousand dollars to the man

33:59.261 --> 34:03.232
that brings me Jack Stone's head.

34:03.866 --> 34:06.268
INMATE: Kobe!

34:16.878 --> 34:18.945
You're in trouble now.

34:18.947 --> 34:22.786
Balam's gonna pay anyone
who'll kill you $100,000.

34:23.585 --> 34:25.920
That goes for guards too.

34:27.589 --> 34:29.391
What are you gonna do?

34:31.027 --> 34:33.293
Most inmates won't make a move.

34:33.295 --> 34:35.996
They don't want more
time on their sentence.

34:35.998 --> 34:38.532
I'm not worried about it.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.433
Most guards are good.

34:40.435 --> 34:43.072
Just stay away from the bad ones.

34:43.806 --> 34:46.340
How will I know who the bad ones are?

34:46.342 --> 34:49.279
They'd be the ones
who'll let you get killed.

34:52.348 --> 34:54.183
Everybody out!

34:54.650 --> 34:56.516
Come on!

34:56.518 --> 34:58.987
- INMATE: Aw, man!
- Now!

34:59.656 --> 35:01.655
INMATE #2: That means you, Martinez.

35:01.657 --> 35:05.393
GUARD: Come on. You too. Hey. Over there.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.362
Out. Move.

35:55.677 --> 35:57.480
Who <i>are</i> you?

35:59.449 --> 36:01.284
A friend.

36:10.592 --> 36:13.094
Well, how did she get all that information?

36:13.096 --> 36:16.931
Come on, she's got lists of
names, contacts, buyers, sellers.

36:16.933 --> 36:19.099
Do not forget who you're speaking with.

36:19.101 --> 36:21.101
Come on, man, she's got proof.

36:21.103 --> 36:22.969
Paperwork, disks, thumb drives.

36:22.971 --> 36:24.672
<i>That's impossible.</i>

36:24.674 --> 36:26.974
I was told it was all burned.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.976
- Look, I am not going down for this.
- <i>Then it's simple.</i>

36:29.978 --> 36:32.514
The woman must die.

36:33.683 --> 36:35.683
All right.

36:35.685 --> 36:38.121
All right, I'll take care of <i>her.</i>

36:38.654 --> 36:40.820
What about Stone?

36:40.822 --> 36:43.859
He will be dead by the end of the day.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.620
(car alarm chirps)

37:13.188 --> 37:15.357
- (cell phone rings)
- (gasps)

37:17.927 --> 37:20.027
- Allison.
- <i>I'm at the airport.</i>

37:20.029 --> 37:23.065
<i>I'll meet up with you
later tonight. All right?</i>

37:49.025 --> 37:51.027
(door closes)

38:45.248 --> 38:47.483
(dryer buzzes)

38:51.621 --> 38:53.389
(baton clatters on ground)

39:05.601 --> 39:08.735
Really? Think about it logically.

39:08.737 --> 39:11.605
- There are, what, eight of you?
- There's nine of us.

39:11.607 --> 39:14.007
- Fine. Eight and a half.
- Hey.

39:14.009 --> 39:16.210
I know a hundred grand
sounds like a lot of money,

39:16.212 --> 39:19.547
but it's really not
when you think about it.

39:19.549 --> 39:22.317
Once you divide it up amongst
yourselves, you're looking at, what?

39:23.618 --> 39:25.184
About 11 grand each?

39:25.186 --> 39:27.688
Eleven thousand sounds just fine to me.

39:27.690 --> 39:30.393
Not when you factor in the risks.

39:31.594 --> 39:33.761
What's he going on about?

39:33.763 --> 39:37.598
Is $11,000 worth a fractured skull?

39:37.600 --> 39:40.833
Ruptured eardrum? Maybe a broken femur?

39:40.835 --> 39:44.137
Cracked ribs? Collapsed lung?

39:44.139 --> 39:47.310
Shards of your nose
stuffed up into your brain.

39:48.710 --> 39:50.746
They're smarter than they look.

40:40.096 --> 40:41.795
Whoo-hoo!

40:41.797 --> 40:43.297
- (laughing)
- Oh, my God.

40:43.299 --> 40:46.000
It's okay. I'm sor... I'm sorry.

40:46.002 --> 40:48.001
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

40:48.003 --> 40:50.237
No. No.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.306
- No! Geez.
- (laughing)

40:52.308 --> 40:55.208
That must have been some visit, huh?

40:55.210 --> 40:58.679
He just wasn't what I expected. He just...

40:58.681 --> 41:00.246
(sighs)

41:00.248 --> 41:02.016
Oh, what's wrong?

41:02.018 --> 41:04.351
I've been going about this all wrong.

41:04.353 --> 41:08.721
I don't think I've ever seen
you so passionate about a story.

41:08.723 --> 41:11.724
This whole time, I have been trying to
connect Jack Stone with the corruption,

41:11.726 --> 41:13.694
which is why I was getting nowhere.

41:13.696 --> 41:17.333
All of this... this is about Balam.

41:18.234 --> 41:21.835
His drug network, his
suppliers, his buyers.

41:21.837 --> 41:24.137
It's all these names.

41:24.139 --> 41:26.708
City officials, police officers.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.375
And the list is long.

41:29.377 --> 41:32.712
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Cross-check everything, make sure I understand it all

41:32.714 --> 41:34.148
and make a call.

41:34.150 --> 41:36.352
(chattering)

41:58.773 --> 42:00.074
What?

42:00.076 --> 42:03.110
Balam said I need to...

42:03.112 --> 42:04.814
apologize.

42:10.386 --> 42:12.522
I am waiting.

42:14.056 --> 42:15.758
I'm...

42:41.851 --> 42:44.451
- (alarm blares)
- Yeah!

42:44.453 --> 42:47.320
GUARD: Move away. Move away.

42:47.322 --> 42:49.424
Let's go, princess.

42:53.895 --> 42:56.898
- Will she be okay?
- Mind your own business.

43:01.904 --> 43:04.137
(monitor beeping)

43:04.139 --> 43:07.174
WOMAN: BP: 126 over 78.

43:07.176 --> 43:09.712
Pulse: 65.

43:11.781 --> 43:16.886
Pupils are dilated and nonresponsive.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.482
- WOMAN: Another?
- MAN: No. Let's let her sleep it off.

43:48.484 --> 43:51.487
Just make sure the next
shift gets that file.

43:53.889 --> 43:55.725
(door closes)

44:05.234 --> 44:07.536
(door closes)

45:08.330 --> 45:10.333
(water splashes)

45:29.585 --> 45:31.554
(grunts)

45:37.025 --> 45:40.259
(squeaking)

45:40.261 --> 45:42.097
(closes)

45:48.436 --> 45:50.739
(sighs)

46:00.081 --> 46:02.752
Hey, Stone, your lady friend is back.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.608
(door closes)

46:33.181 --> 46:35.449
Jack, I read about your wife.

46:35.451 --> 46:37.717
I'm so sorry.

46:37.719 --> 46:41.721
So you've figured out I wasn't working
for the Russian mob like the paper said?

46:41.723 --> 46:43.590
But I did find out who was.

46:43.592 --> 46:48.228
Once I went to my partner,
told him what I found,

46:48.230 --> 46:50.532
he went to the mob.

46:52.201 --> 46:54.134
(woman screaming)

46:54.136 --> 46:57.540
They ordered a hit on me, and
that's when Elizabeth was killed.

47:08.384 --> 47:10.019
(groans)

47:11.753 --> 47:14.487
- <i>(gunshot)</i>
- And I killed him.

47:14.489 --> 47:16.192
(grunts)

47:22.431 --> 47:24.598
What are you gonna do with
the information I sent you?

47:24.600 --> 47:28.067
Jack, I know why you're here.

47:28.069 --> 47:30.805
You're gonna get yourself
killed doing this.

47:33.074 --> 47:35.509
What happens to me doesn't matter.

47:35.511 --> 47:37.777
This is about those responsible.

47:37.779 --> 47:41.313
(men chattering)

47:41.315 --> 47:44.351
I'm totally allergic to onions,
and the waitress comes over, like,

47:44.353 --> 47:47.320
"What, you don't like no onions in
your tacos? They're not for you?"

47:47.322 --> 47:49.155
And I'm, like, "I just can't eat 'em.

47:49.157 --> 47:52.192
I get sick." (continues, low)

47:52.194 --> 47:55.730
(imitating Mexican accident) "No
onions. Onions are no good for you."

48:28.197 --> 48:31.166
(men chattering)

48:34.636 --> 48:37.670
Yeah? Is she happy? Is she happier?

48:37.672 --> 48:40.942
Yeah, she seems happier.
I got a full-time job now.

49:16.210 --> 49:18.080
(door closes)

49:24.652 --> 49:26.888
Excuse me, Doctor.

49:29.891 --> 49:34.828
(chuckles) That's very flattering,
William, but I'm just a nurse.

49:34.830 --> 49:36.929
- Just a nurse?
- Mm-hmm.

49:36.931 --> 49:39.799
Well, I hear the nurses do all the work

49:39.801 --> 49:43.469
while the doctors are
all off golfing somewhere.

49:43.471 --> 49:45.271
(chuckles)

49:45.273 --> 49:48.844
Okay, charmer, spit it
out. What do you want?

49:51.746 --> 49:54.713
Uh, well, I was hoping you could

49:54.715 --> 49:58.152
answer an embarrassing
medical question for me.

50:09.797 --> 50:11.297
Ohh.

50:11.299 --> 50:14.068
(chattering)

50:16.205 --> 50:18.340
How long have you been undercover?

50:19.473 --> 50:21.876
You're still alive?

50:23.311 --> 50:25.645
If I were a betting
man, you'd make me rich.

50:25.647 --> 50:29.884
Which one is it? FBI? CIA?

50:32.587 --> 50:34.422
FBI.

50:37.960 --> 50:42.529
This place has been plagued with corruption
for years. We didn't know how deep it went.

50:42.531 --> 50:45.465
Every time we get the
evidence we think we need,

50:45.467 --> 50:47.903
it mysteriously disappears.

50:49.003 --> 50:51.272
You know why I am here?

50:56.478 --> 50:57.876
You gonna stand in my way?

50:57.878 --> 51:01.183
(chattering)

51:05.821 --> 51:09.521
I've been here for six months. I'm not gonna
get anywhere as long as Balam is around.

51:09.523 --> 51:12.425
He's lining too many government
pockets to ever get a conviction.

51:12.427 --> 51:15.561
Now, as soon as I knew you were coming in,

51:15.563 --> 51:19.301
I knew I had the missing
piece to make a difference.

51:22.036 --> 51:24.473
Here they come.

51:25.806 --> 51:28.009
MAN: Hey!

51:35.917 --> 51:37.886
Oh, yeah!

51:41.489 --> 51:44.357
There's more than just me here. Get
ready to move when the time comes.

51:44.359 --> 51:46.795
GUARD: Back it off!
Back it off! Back it off!

51:52.801 --> 51:55.471
(mumbling)

51:56.971 --> 51:59.505
By the time I'm done with this,
I'm gonna be fluent in Russian.

51:59.507 --> 52:02.041
Mm.

52:02.043 --> 52:03.777
(imitating Russia accent) How do you say...

52:03.779 --> 52:08.748
"Jack, you're so sexy.
I need you. I want you."

52:08.750 --> 52:10.983
- You need help.
- (laughs)

52:10.985 --> 52:14.320
- I need boyfriend.
- Mm.

52:14.322 --> 52:17.891
(normal voice) I mean, really, why
don't you hire a translator for all this?

52:17.893 --> 52:19.692
The information's too sensitive.

52:19.694 --> 52:21.561
If everything I've seen here is true,

52:21.563 --> 52:23.432
a lot of people are going to prison.

52:40.514 --> 52:43.851
(no audible dialogue)

53:13.614 --> 53:16.782
When you transferred in here six
months ago, they told me two things.

53:16.784 --> 53:19.152
One, that you were a nonviolent offender.

53:19.154 --> 53:22.855
And two, that I should
give you trustee status.

53:22.857 --> 53:26.893
I've never had a reason to
question those until today.

53:26.895 --> 53:31.600
William, I have to say, I'm
very disappointed in you.

53:32.967 --> 53:36.770
Three inmates say they
saw you pick up Losif

53:36.772 --> 53:39.105
and throw him over that railing.

53:39.107 --> 53:42.541
Now, I wanna know why
you'd do such a thing.

53:42.543 --> 53:44.744
Romans 13:4...

53:44.746 --> 53:46.913
"If thou do which is evil, be afraid:

53:46.915 --> 53:48.681
for he beareth not the sword in vain:

53:48.683 --> 53:50.884
for he is a minister of God,

53:50.886 --> 53:53.786
a revenger who will execute wrath

53:53.788 --> 53:56.956
on him who doeth evil."

53:56.958 --> 53:59.261
I'll be honest with you, William.

54:01.630 --> 54:04.465
The Bible came with the office, okay?

54:06.067 --> 54:10.804
Now, if you wanna put your faith in God
to save you, that's up to you, but...

54:10.806 --> 54:13.706
but the truth is, behind these walls,

54:13.708 --> 54:15.775
I'm the only savior you need.

54:15.777 --> 54:19.112
And trust me, son, you need saving.

54:19.114 --> 54:22.514
Losif was Balam's boy.

54:22.516 --> 54:26.119
Now, if I try to put you back in
"A" block... hell, any block...

54:26.121 --> 54:28.657
you'd be dead by the end of the week.

54:29.558 --> 54:31.393
Oh.

54:32.060 --> 54:33.960
Well, can you help me?

54:33.962 --> 54:36.596
Well, it's not a question of can I.

54:36.598 --> 54:38.730
It's more a question of will I.

54:38.732 --> 54:42.003
I don't know. Will you?

54:44.139 --> 54:47.509
Yes, for a price.

54:51.246 --> 54:55.217
Well, I-I don't... I don't have any money.

54:56.717 --> 54:58.817
<i>You</i> don't.

54:58.819 --> 55:01.954
But I'm certain you got some
friends or relatives out there

55:01.956 --> 55:06.625
that could scrounge up some
cash for you, save your hide,

55:06.627 --> 55:09.628
that is if they think
your hide needs saving.

55:09.630 --> 55:11.563
My brother's got money.

55:11.565 --> 55:14.032
Well, there you go.

55:14.034 --> 55:20.042
Now, is your brother's love
for you worth, say, $10,000?

55:20.842 --> 55:23.876
I don't... I don't know.

55:23.878 --> 55:26.145
I'll tell you what.

55:26.147 --> 55:29.949
Why don't you go back out and get
to work and think about it, okay?

55:29.951 --> 55:33.155
When you're ready to give your
brother a call, you let me know.

55:33.955 --> 55:36.324
But you better think quick. Huh?

55:37.592 --> 55:39.992
'Cause you know how
communication works in this place.

55:39.994 --> 55:42.730
Balam's probably already
found out what you did.

55:46.034 --> 55:50.302
So if my brother pays you $10,000,

55:50.304 --> 55:53.040
will you promise not to let me get killed?

55:55.243 --> 55:57.712
My hand on the Bible.

56:02.683 --> 56:04.784
I need to speak with Mr. Johnson, please.

56:04.786 --> 56:06.719
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, but it is important.

56:06.721 --> 56:09.221
It always is.

56:09.223 --> 56:12.025
- MARK: Is there a problem here?
- I need to speak with the DA.

56:12.027 --> 56:14.994
Oh. More conspiracies.

56:14.996 --> 56:19.601
Look, Miss Sinclair, if you
have a problem, call the FBI.

56:20.302 --> 56:23.205
You're going down with the rest of them.

56:28.176 --> 56:31.346
(speaking Russian)

56:59.708 --> 57:02.144
(security door buzzes)

57:20.895 --> 57:22.831
What the hell?

57:24.965 --> 57:27.866
Not feeling well, princess?

57:27.868 --> 57:30.171
ALL: Ohh!

57:32.072 --> 57:33.706
(gagging)

57:33.708 --> 57:35.708
(security door buzzes)

57:35.710 --> 57:37.376
Move! Move! Back!

57:37.378 --> 57:40.581
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

57:43.384 --> 57:44.817
Stay back!

57:44.819 --> 57:47.119
Don't touch me! Get away from me!

57:47.121 --> 57:49.223
WOMAN: Watch out! Watch out!

57:57.998 --> 58:00.201
- (grunts)
- What?

58:07.808 --> 58:09.511
(grunts)

58:15.215 --> 58:17.150
- You okay?
- Yeah.

58:17.152 --> 58:19.753
All right, let's get these guys in.

58:24.458 --> 58:26.992
Are you sure we can trust him?

58:26.994 --> 58:30.632
As long as Balam has the power,
we can't get what we came for.

58:33.134 --> 58:35.536
Jack's just a means to an end.

58:38.806 --> 58:40.373
All right,

58:40.375 --> 58:42.041
- you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

58:42.043 --> 58:43.912
Okay, let's go.

59:06.134 --> 59:08.436
(speaking Russian)

59:09.036 --> 59:11.406
Is this true?

59:17.078 --> 59:18.913
Is this you?

59:25.920 --> 59:27.789
Dad?

01:00:03.324 --> 01:00:05.527
(blows)

01:00:29.449 --> 01:00:31.719
(spraying)

01:00:39.259 --> 01:00:43.128
I've been lied to my whole entire
life. I thought you were dead.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:45.634
I stayed away to protect you.

01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:51.003
I was told that you
were some national hero,

01:00:51.005 --> 01:00:55.041
sacrificing a life with his
family for the love of his country.

01:00:55.043 --> 01:00:57.844
- And I... I accepted that.
- Olesya, I...

01:00:57.846 --> 01:01:00.482
Did Mom know what you are?

01:01:01.281 --> 01:01:04.050
I do not know what you've been told,

01:01:04.052 --> 01:01:05.918
but it is not true.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.387
Drugs.

01:01:08.389 --> 01:01:12.625
Weapons. Human trafficking?

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:14.860
I mean, I couldn't even
bear to read the rest.

01:01:14.862 --> 01:01:18.532
It was just page after page, and it...

01:01:31.946 --> 01:01:33.415
Standing by.

01:01:34.014 --> 01:01:36.518
(body thuds)

01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:56.638
I'm in.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:59.505
(typing)

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:01.576
(beeps)

01:02:04.612 --> 01:02:07.115
For once, be a man.

01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:10.584
Tell me the truth.

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:14.420
I want you to look me in the eyes

01:02:14.422 --> 01:02:19.391
and tell me that all of those things
I read in those files are not true.

01:02:19.393 --> 01:02:23.130
Those things, they are not true.

01:02:25.165 --> 01:02:28.134
You're not even man enough to admit it.

01:02:28.136 --> 01:02:33.471
You know what? You... You
made a choice a long time ago

01:02:33.473 --> 01:02:35.641
not to be a part of my life.

01:02:35.643 --> 01:02:40.079
So I'm making a choice right
now never to be a part of yours.

01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:41.947
I don't want anything to do with you.

01:02:41.949 --> 01:02:44.050
I don't know what you are.

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:47.320
But I don't ever wanna find out.

01:02:47.322 --> 01:02:50.989
Olesya, you're not safe now!

01:02:50.991 --> 01:02:53.192
They'll come for you!

01:02:53.194 --> 01:02:56.697
Then I guess this is the
last time you'll ever see me.

01:02:58.465 --> 01:03:00.634
(door opens)

01:03:09.677 --> 01:03:13.114
I have Balam and a guard escort
leaving the visiting area.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.750
Semyon is in "A" block.

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:20.186
(typing)

01:03:20.188 --> 01:03:24.657
Fedor and the rest of the crew are in
the sublevel waiting for Balam to return.

01:03:24.659 --> 01:03:27.293
<i>And Jack's in solitary.</i>

01:03:27.295 --> 01:03:30.295
Okay, Jack, let's see if you're
as good as they say you are.

01:03:30.297 --> 01:03:32.667
(security door buzzes)

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:37.737
What are you messing with?

01:03:37.739 --> 01:03:39.773
You answer me.

01:03:45.346 --> 01:03:47.782
Solitary, go to nine.

01:03:50.351 --> 01:03:52.751
It's Will, your cleaner friend.

01:03:52.753 --> 01:03:55.489
I take it this is not a social call.

01:03:56.391 --> 01:03:58.290
I got the control hub. My
partner's got surveillance.

01:03:58.292 --> 01:04:00.127
We're going to help you get to Balam.

01:04:29.489 --> 01:04:30.790
Which way?

01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:32.893
Head right.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.170
WOMAN: <i>Go left.</i>

01:04:55.148 --> 01:04:57.315
Door 5B.

01:04:57.317 --> 01:04:59.888
5B. 5B.

01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:02.688
(beeps)

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:06.027
(buzzes)

01:05:13.301 --> 01:05:14.733
23C.

01:05:14.735 --> 01:05:17.038
(security door buzzes)

01:05:26.447 --> 01:05:27.882
(buzzes)

01:05:29.449 --> 01:05:31.652
(buzzing)

01:05:33.753 --> 01:05:35.822
I have a guard at the door.

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:39.190
All right, Jack, we're running out of time.

01:05:39.192 --> 01:05:42.029
Just get me as close to Balam as possible.

01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:51.706
He's getting close to you, Jack.

01:05:53.907 --> 01:05:58.112

01:06:17.797 --> 01:06:20.067

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:23.804
MAN: Eric, wake up!

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:30.175

- Eric!

01:06:30.177 --> 01:06:35.280
- Wake up! I wanna go home!
- (buzzing)

01:06:35.282 --> 01:06:37.248
- (buzzing)
- What's going on?

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.384
Sorry, sir. I left my keys inside,

01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:41.387
and that knucklehead probably fell asleep.

01:06:41.389 --> 01:06:44.692
(sighs, clicks tongue)

01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:49.931

01:06:59.739 --> 01:07:02.641

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:04.777
Hey! Hey, open the door!

01:07:04.779 --> 01:07:07.279
- Come on!
- (banging)

01:07:07.281 --> 01:07:09.650
Jack, we've lost our eyes.

01:07:14.487 --> 01:07:16.755
We're not messing around here. Open it up.

01:07:16.757 --> 01:07:18.757
- Hey, open.
- Hurry up!

01:07:18.759 --> 01:07:21.663
We're screwed. They're here, Jack.

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.530
- Open them all.
- What do you mean open them all?

01:07:25.532 --> 01:07:28.268
Hallways, cell blocks,
everything. Open them!

01:07:32.373 --> 01:07:34.909
(security doors buzzing)

01:07:42.917 --> 01:07:44.750
(beeping)

01:07:44.752 --> 01:07:47.121
(security doors buzzing)

01:07:57.831 --> 01:08:00.468
Back... Get back... Back in your cells!

01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:04.802
Initiate lockdown
protocol! No one in or out!

01:08:04.804 --> 01:08:07.038
This is a level-one emergency!

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.007
(alarm buzzing)

01:08:09.009 --> 01:08:11.411

01:08:29.529 --> 01:08:31.499
Yeah! Ha, ha!

01:08:39.339 --> 01:08:40.975
Come on!

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:58.392
Back in your cells.

01:08:58.758 --> 01:09:00.492
Go, go, go!

01:09:00.493 --> 01:09:03.296

01:09:38.598 --> 01:09:41.033

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:53.880

01:10:03.057 --> 01:10:04.823
Guard!

01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:08.362
Guard! Guard! Call them off!

01:10:09.029 --> 01:10:11.598
My money is on the inmates.

01:10:12.098 --> 01:10:13.998
No!

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.137
Hey, they want me for dead!

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:23.110
(screaming)

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.084
I was just about to come for you.

01:10:33.486 --> 01:10:35.421
(speaking Russian)

01:10:35.423 --> 01:10:37.859
No! I want Stone!

01:11:35.782 --> 01:11:38.018
INMATES: Ohh!

01:11:50.263 --> 01:11:52.199
(rings)

01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:56.534
- (beeps)
- Hello.

01:11:56.536 --> 01:11:59.270
- MAN: <i>It's time.</i>
- Great.

01:11:59.272 --> 01:12:01.206
Best news I've heard in a long time.

01:12:01.208 --> 01:12:03.742
<i>Don't forget to clean up.
Your money is waiting for you.</i>

01:12:03.744 --> 01:12:05.545
I'll get on it.

01:12:06.813 --> 01:12:08.579
- (sighs)
- Good news?

01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:12.285
The best. This job's finally done.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.358
I want everything.

01:12:18.057 --> 01:12:20.058
I need all the original files.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.292
Allison?

01:12:21.294 --> 01:12:24.130
Disks, thumb drives, everything.

01:12:24.764 --> 01:12:27.034
Get up now.

01:12:27.868 --> 01:12:29.801
Stone!

01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:31.706
Stone!

01:12:33.273 --> 01:12:35.442
Stone!

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.682
Lieutenant.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:19.419
Lieutenant, any sign of the warden?

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.157
- No.
- Balam's close. Don't let me stop you.

01:14:34.128 --> 01:14:36.630
(speaking Russian)

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:58.719
(speaking Russian)

01:15:26.379 --> 01:15:28.781
(screams)

01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:34.920
Now get up and give me
everything or I will shoot you.

01:15:34.922 --> 01:15:36.387
You aren't gonna shoot me, Allison.

01:15:36.389 --> 01:15:39.224
Believe me, I want to.

01:15:39.226 --> 01:15:41.929
What are you doing? You're my friend.

01:15:43.429 --> 01:15:46.333
They offered me a lot of money.

01:15:46.767 --> 01:15:49.134
You're cheap labor, Allison.

01:15:49.136 --> 01:15:53.238
Probably hired to watch
and observe but not to act.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.342
That's where you're wrong.

01:16:31.344 --> 01:16:33.780
FBI, Miss Sinclair.

01:16:40.454 --> 01:16:44.855
William, about got your
empty head shot off.

01:16:44.857 --> 01:16:47.393
Now, get out of the way so we can teach...

01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:59.939
GUARD: Get out of here!

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:03.509
No, no, no... (groans)

01:17:05.445 --> 01:17:08.046
I'm sorry, man. Sorry, man.

01:17:08.048 --> 01:17:11.485
It's just my job, all right? (panting)

01:17:12.119 --> 01:17:13.821
Okay, okay.

01:17:19.092 --> 01:17:20.694
W-William?

01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:24.895
No, no, no. No, wait.

01:17:24.897 --> 01:17:26.463
Wait just a second.

01:17:26.465 --> 01:17:28.533
I got... I got... I got money.

01:17:28.535 --> 01:17:30.467
I got... I got drugs!

01:17:30.469 --> 01:17:33.037
I got... I got whatever you need. Come on.

01:17:33.039 --> 01:17:35.172
Don't you... Fr-Freedom!

01:17:35.174 --> 01:17:38.210
I can get you freedom!
I'll get you out of here!

01:17:38.212 --> 01:17:40.311
Please. Please don't.

01:17:40.313 --> 01:17:43.881
The Bible. The Bible.
Remember the scriptures!

01:17:43.883 --> 01:17:47.420
- You're a man of faith.
- I do remember.

01:17:48.989 --> 01:17:51.491
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:17:54.328 --> 01:17:56.062
Clear!

01:17:58.331 --> 01:18:00.066
Clear!

01:18:01.567 --> 01:18:03.503
Clear!

01:18:05.905 --> 01:18:07.874
Take a left.

01:18:08.208 --> 01:18:10.477
Stick on me!

01:18:13.946 --> 01:18:16.650
(men shouting)

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:32.398
BALAM: Stone!

01:18:33.967 --> 01:18:36.402
Stone!

01:18:40.907 --> 01:18:42.843
Stone!

01:18:44.645 --> 01:18:46.347
Stone!

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.520
Your wife, Elizabeth.

01:18:56.522 --> 01:19:01.059
It wasn't personal. Just business.

01:19:01.061 --> 01:19:02.963
You made this personal...

01:19:04.063 --> 01:19:06.366
by dragging my daughter into this.

01:19:13.941 --> 01:19:16.510
They'll kill her because of you!

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:20.614
They're gonna kill her
because of <i>you!</i>

01:21:26.072 --> 01:21:27.505
Get on the ground!

01:21:27.507 --> 01:21:29.174
Get on the ground!

01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:30.608
Get against the wall!

01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:32.342
(all shouting)

01:21:32.344 --> 01:21:35.646
Down! Get down! Get down!

01:21:35.648 --> 01:21:37.448
Break it up! Break it up!

01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:39.250
MAN: Two in!

01:21:39.252 --> 01:21:40.618
Clear!

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.554
- Clear!
- Last man!

01:21:42.556 --> 01:21:44.590
Clear!

01:21:57.303 --> 01:21:59.705
(door opens)

01:22:02.142 --> 01:22:04.144
Jack?

01:22:05.579 --> 01:22:07.748
Do what you came to do?

01:22:08.347 --> 01:22:09.949
I did.

01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:18.756
Why did you let me?

01:22:18.758 --> 01:22:20.625
I lost my partner a few years back.

01:22:20.627 --> 01:22:24.394
Balam had him skinned, cut into pieces.

01:22:24.396 --> 01:22:27.465
Mailed the parts to his family.

01:22:27.467 --> 01:22:29.634
You did what no one
else had the balls to do.

01:22:29.636 --> 01:22:31.502
(grunts)

01:22:31.504 --> 01:22:33.604
Uh, meet my new partner.

01:22:33.606 --> 01:22:35.340
Agent Childs.

01:22:35.342 --> 01:22:37.277
You all right?

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:40.079
I've had worse.

01:22:40.646 --> 01:22:42.648
All right, let's go.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.854
Look, off the record, I'd like
to thank you for what you did.

01:22:49.856 --> 01:22:53.625
By eliminating Balam and his
men, you've opened the pathway.

01:22:53.627 --> 01:22:57.929
An opportunity to clean house,
not just here, but downtown.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:01.299
I appreciate that, but I
should be thanking you guys.

01:23:01.301 --> 01:23:03.368
Well, don't thank us just yet.

01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:06.907
Yeah. We still have to arrest you.

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:11.408
