The trunk is red. The car is black.
Lid of the trunk is red.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.757
[mechanic] Yeah, so?

02:13.925 --> 02:17.720
So, I said "nondescript," you know?
It's got a red trunk.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.723
-"Nondescript"?
-Yeah, as in non-recognizable,

02:20.807 --> 02:23.685
as in not a black fucking car
with a red fucking trunk.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.311

-[signal beeps]
-Clay, I don't wanna leave you a message.

06:29.889 --> 06:33.768
I'm on my way to work.
I should only take 30 minutes or so,

06:33.851 --> 06:36.521
and then I'm gonna go to the party,
but I got no parking instructions, bro.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.272
Nobody called me about parking.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.775
Clay, pick up the phone.
Call me back, come on.

Hey, Kate, what's going on?
I'm working, sweetheart.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.782
[Kate]  Dad, I'm going
to the Phoenix tonight,

06:47.865 --> 06:50.701
- so I'll be home at, like, 1:00 or 2:00.
-1:00 or 2:00?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.411
-Yes.
-What's the Phoenix?

06:52.495 --> 06:55.414
-It's a place.
-Yeah? What kind of place?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.750
[Kate]  A music place, like live music.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.170
Oh, like live music?
Wow, that sounds fun. Who's driving?

07:01.254 --> 07:05.341
[Kate]  Dad, I'm not calling to ask you.
I'm calling to tell you, as a courtesy.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.553
[chuckles]
Sweetheart, you're 13 years old.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.639
13. You  are  calling to ask me.
Well, you don't have to go.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.266
You can stay home. Your choice.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.727
[Kate]  I think Audrey's driving.
But maybe Ryan.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.937
-No Ryan.
-Dad!

07:18.020 --> 07:20.731
We're not going through this again.
You screwed up with Ryan last time.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.651
[Kate]  That's so unfair. You can't make me
stay home on a Friday night.

07:23.734 --> 07:27.071
It's not up for discussion, Kate.
I can't talk. I'm busy. I gotta work.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.197
I'm just gonna go anyways.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.199
Don't leave the apartment
or you're grounded for life.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.243
-Do you hear me?
-I'm going anyways.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.369

[passenger] I mean, I'm not questioning.
You must be a good driver.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.348
It's just I've never seen anyone
drive a stick on a job before.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.143
Yeah, it's always automatics.
Column shifters or whatever.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.657
Wanna hear something funny? My girlfriend
thinks I'm too old to rock a hawk.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.618
So, you know what I did?
I just grabbed a pair of her clippers.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.329
I just zinged this right-- voop--
right off, like that.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.541
The last couple of weeks...
[rustles] ever since.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.625
What's your name, man?

09:05.044 --> 09:06.170
[driver] I don't wanna talk.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.047
What?

09:09.131 --> 09:11.801
Chitchat. I don't chitchat
unless it's about the job.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.555
-Talk about the job?
-Yeah.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.099
You know, "get in," "look out,"
"watch for the cops."

09:18.182 --> 09:19.559
-That kind of shit.
-Cop? Cop? Where is he?

09:19.642 --> 09:21.644
Where is he?
[laughs]

09:23.271 --> 09:24.730
I'm just playing.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.238
What's in the bag?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.115
[driver] Sit back.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.533
-What's that?
-Sit back.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.826
-What is it?
-Sit back.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.913
-I will.
-Just sit the fuck back. It's my lunch.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.543
-Your lunch?
-Yeah, my lunch.

09:45.626 --> 09:46.627
[mohawk man chuckles]

09:46.711 --> 09:48.087
[driver] I don't know how long
I'm gonna be out here tonight,

09:48.170 --> 09:49.213
so I brought my lunch.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.216
Oh, so you think
we might be out here a while, huh?

09:52.300 --> 09:53.759
Let's hope not, right?

09:55.511 --> 09:57.763
-Just sit back.
-Okay.

10:02.518 --> 10:03.561
[mohawk man]
You're carrying though, right?

10:05.563 --> 10:06.480
What?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.108
You got a piece on you?
A "whistle"? A gun?

10:11.736 --> 10:15.489
All business with the big man up front.
No chitchat, no talk. Silent type.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.159
That's Clint Eastwood up front.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.911
You know who that is?
Do the brothers love Clint Eastwood?

10:24.624 --> 10:28.085
-What's your fucking name, man?
-I'm not telling you my name, man.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.170
-No?
-No.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.047
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.508
I gotta call you something.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.844
Three dudes sitting in a fucking car,
nothing to call each other--

10:36.927 --> 10:38.763
that's just weird, man.
I think that's just--

10:38.846 --> 10:40.556
that's just fucking--
just fucking weird.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.268
Yeah, you know, what's weird, cowboy,
is you keep fucking asking me my name.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.563
That's weird. I drive the car.
I'm the wheelman, okay?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.357
That's it. End of story.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.734
-That's it, you're just the wheelman?
-That's right.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.403
-You just drive the car.
-Yeah, I do.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.155
Well, then I'll just call you "Wheelman."

10:56.238 --> 10:58.074
-That's fine.
-I know that's fine.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.619
And you can call me "Motherfucker."

11:04.622 --> 11:07.583
-[Motherfucker] What about you?
-My name is Ben Okri,

11:07.667 --> 11:10.211
but you can call me
"I want my fucking money."

11:10.294 --> 11:11.295
Wow.

11:12.338 --> 11:17.218
The whole thing, huh?
Well, okey-dokey, Ben Okri.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.430
The guy in the front has a black belt
in fucking weirdness. That's Wheelman.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.100
I'm Motherfucker and...

11:27.603 --> 11:29.146
here we are.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.694
It's still fucking weird,
but, at least, we're all somebody, right?

[rustling, clicking]

12:12.523 --> 12:14.191
Fuck are you doing?
Pull closer.

12:14.275 --> 12:18.028
-I can see everything better from here.
-It's a long fucking walk. Pull closer.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.448
I'll be here. I'll be right here.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.043
[phone ringtone plays]

12:37.965 --> 12:40.009
-Yeah?
-[man]  You know who this is?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.886
Yeah, I think so.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.346
-[bangs]
-Pull fucking closer next time!

12:44.430 --> 12:45.681
[man on phone]  Say it.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.437
You're the handler.
You hired Clay. Clay hired me.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.980
[handler]  So, you're driving for me.

12:53.063 --> 12:56.567
-How do you like the car?
-It's fine, man. It's fine. Where's Clay?

12:56.650 --> 12:59.153
-No issues with it?
-The trunk's red, but--

12:59.236 --> 13:01.155
-What's that?
-Nothing. It's fine, man.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.073
I need the drop.
Clay never gave me the drop.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.825
What do you think of the other two?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.368
They're inside doing your thing right now.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.579
-Oh, they're in the bank?
-They're in the bank right now.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.707
-I need the drop. I don't have the drop.
-What do you think of me?

13:12.833 --> 13:14.168
I don't know you.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.879
You don't know me?
You just told me you know who I am.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.548
I know it's your job, okay?
I never met you. I don't know your name.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.133
-I don't know anything.
-I know you.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.011
Is that right?

13:24.094 --> 13:28.265
How many years did you do
for that warehouse fire? Three years.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.935
I'm guessing your ass is a little tender,
and you owe big.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.479
And so, here you are.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.774
Yeah. What the fuck is this?

13:36.857 --> 13:40.402
For the rest of the night, you don't take
any calls except for this blocked number.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.489
When the other two get back in the car,
they'll put the money in the trunk.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.117
-Then I want you to leave them.
-Fuck does that mean?

13:47.201 --> 13:49.370
-Leave them behind.
-I'm not fucking doing that.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.164
-You will.
-I'm not leaving them behind.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.166
-They're gonna kill you.
-Fuck...

13:54.250 --> 13:56.252
-Where's Clay?
-I told them to kill you at the drop.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.753
-I wanna talk to Clay.
-Leave them behind,

13:57.836 --> 13:59.713
or they'll shoot you
in the head at the drop.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.301
-Open up! Open the fucking trunk!
-Fuck. Where the fuck is Clay?

14:06.178 --> 14:07.888
-[phone line beeping]

Hey, this is Clay. Leave me a message.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.540
-Clay?
-I'll call you.

14:34.623 --> 14:38.127
Clay, there's a fucking problem, man!
Call me back!

14:38.210 --> 14:39.211
-Shit.
-[phone ringing]

14:41.964 --> 14:43.924
-Hello?
-[woman]  ...that's totally ridiculous--

14:44.008 --> 14:45.634
-Hello, hello?
-[woman]  Hello?

14:45.718 --> 14:48.137
-Where's Clay?
-Uh... hey, where'd Clay go?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.472
-I'm not sure...
-See if he's there. See if he's there.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.058
He's not here. I don't know where he's at.
I just picked up his phone.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.477
-Wanna leave a message?
-Listen, tell him to call his driver.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.105
-His driver?
-Yeah, his fucking driver. It's urgent.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.816
Don't be fucking around!
Tell him to call his driver!

15:00.983 --> 15:02.067
-Okay, his dri--
-Stupid.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.738
-Where the fuck's Clay?
-[handler]  Where are you?

15:07.114 --> 15:09.199
I wanna talk to Clay, man.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.951
-Where are you?
-I don't know.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.495
I don't know where I am, man.
Lincoln-- Lincoln and...

15:13.579 --> 15:15.998
Lincoln and 3rd somewhere.
Where's the drop?

15:16.081 --> 15:18.876
-You're not headed to the drop.
-Come again?

15:19.543 --> 15:22.546
Now that I know you're the kind of guy
who would leave his fucking crew behind,

15:22.630 --> 15:25.174
-you're gonna do a few things for me.
-Hey, hey! Fuckface!

15:25.257 --> 15:26.759
-You told me to leave them!
-[handler chuckles]

15:27.593 --> 15:31.096
It's not your fault. You do
what you gotta do to survive, right?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.766
You know what? Fuck you, man.
I don't know you. I wanna talk to Clay.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.394
-There's a few things you need to do.
-Fuck you! Where's Clay?

15:37.478 --> 15:40.814
You better shut your fucking mouth
and do what I tell you to do. You hear me?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.734
-Or you're gonna get hurt.
-Why don't you tell me--

15:43.817 --> 15:45.819
why don't you tell me where you are,
tough guy, okay?

15:45.903 --> 15:47.947
-And then you could hurt me?
-No, we'll get to that.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.490
I hope we do.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.825
First things first.
I want you to count the money.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.829
-What do you mean, count the money?
-Asshole, pull over and count the money.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.791
I'm not fucking counting anything
till I get to a safe spot.

15:58.874 --> 15:59.917
How long?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.629
-Where's "out of area"?
-What?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.048
Your number says "out of area."

16:06.131 --> 16:07.800
-Where is that?
-Don't worry about where I am.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.636
-Worry about where the fuck you are.
-I hope you're somewhere safe, pal.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.222
-How long?
-Hold on.

Hey.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.943
It's about 200 grand,
maybe a little bit more.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.031
Hello?

Hello?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.828

-It's about $200,000.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.955
-Did you count it?
-Yeah, I counted it.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.915
-It's different fucking bills.
-Different bills?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.168
-So, you didn't count it?
-No.

17:24.251 --> 17:27.463
Look, it's different fucking
denominations. It's about 200,000.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.089
Go fucking count it again!

17:29.173 --> 17:31.300
Go fuck yourself.
I'm not counting it again.

17:32.676 --> 17:33.677
Hey.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.554

[distant siren wails]

18:10.881 --> 18:12.049
[sirens continue]

18:37.825 --> 18:42.538
It's 230 fucking thousand dollars,
minus a thousand for me counting it twice.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.331
That's my clerical fee.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.959
[handler]  Yes, how much?

18:48.043 --> 18:51.547
Jesus fucking Christ! 230--
where do you keep fucking going?

18:51.630 --> 18:55.843
-How much money is there?
-It's fucking two-- it's $230,000.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.303
-You sure?
-I'm fucking sure.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.597
All right, sit tight. I'll call you back.

What the fuck is going on?

19:28.041 --> 19:29.459
[ringtone chimes]

19:30.794 --> 19:31.670
Fuck.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.014
[ringtone playing]

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
[handler]  You pulled away.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.771
-How did you know I pulled away?
-Go to Chandler Station.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.690
[phone line beeping]

19:51.773 --> 19:53.025
[handler]  Someone else calling you?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.068
No.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.864
-Is that the drop?
-Do you know where Chandler Station is?

19:58.947 --> 20:00.699
Yeah, I know
where fucking Chandler Station is.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.659
I'm not a moron.
What do you want me to do?

20:02.743 --> 20:06.872
I want you to drive there
and don't answer any other phone calls.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.540
[phone line beeping]

20:10.125 --> 20:11.585
-Go fuck yourself.
-[ringtone playing]

20:12.336 --> 20:13.420
God...

20:14.087 --> 20:16.048
-Dad?
-What's up, Kate?

20:16.924 --> 20:21.345
I'm at home. I just wanted to tell you,
so you don't freak out. And this sucks.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.847
Yeah, I know it sucks.
Just watch a movie, okay? Good girl.

20:25.098 --> 20:28.185
I called Mom.
I'm going over there tomorrow.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.520
-You're not going over there, Kate.
-I already called her.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.773
You're not going, okay?
This is my weekend.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.068
It's my weekend too, and I'm not gonna
sit around here, just waiting around.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.819
-Do me a favor. Listen...
-I'm going to Mom's.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.863
I love you. I don't have time
for this right now.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.990
-What  do  you have time for, Dad?
-I'm very busy, Kate.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.034
-You and Mom are divorcing--
-Just hang up on him.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.577
-Who is that?
-[Kate]  What? I can't hear--

20:45.661 --> 20:48.580
Who is that?
Hey, who is that?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.749
Is that Ryan? Kate?

20:51.750 --> 20:54.878
-We're just gonna watch a movie...
-Put him on the phone.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.588
-No.
-Put him on the phone!

20:56.672 --> 20:58.674
-[Ryan]  Hang up!
-Kate!

20:58.757 --> 20:59.633
[line beeping]

20:59.716 --> 21:01.593
Son of a bitchin' kid.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.056
[recording]
Hey, what's up? This is Katie.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.558
Leave me a message,
and I'll call you right back. Bye.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.269
[signal beeping]

21:10.352 --> 21:13.647
Katherine, call your father back.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.857
Now. Call me back.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.277
[mutters]
Pick up the fucking--

21:36.837 --> 21:39.089
[siren wails]

21:47.597 --> 21:50.100
[ringtone playing]

21:52.853 --> 21:55.689
-Clay?
-What is going on?

21:55.772 --> 21:58.275
This whole thing's gone
fucking sideways, Clay.

21:58.358 --> 22:01.153
-Wait, what? What? What do you mean?
-This fucking job, it's fucked, man.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.906
This guy's jerking me around. He made me
leave the other two guys at the bank.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.743
-What? Who?
-The fucking handler guy.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.953
-No, who got left behind?
-The other guys.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.913
-He made me leave them, bro.
-You left them?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.749
-Where are they now?
-I don't know.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.876
Holy shit, those were my guys.
You shouldn't have done that.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.170
-Why didn't you call me?
-I did fucking call--

22:18.754 --> 22:21.757
I did call you, Clay. I called you
50 fucking times. Look at your phone, man.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.092
-Why didn't you have your phone on?
-I have, but--

22:24.176 --> 22:26.595
This guy told me to fucking leave 'em
when they came out of the bank.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.305
-He said they're gonna shoot me, Clay.
-Shoot you?

22:28.388 --> 22:30.182
-Yes.
-He said they were gonna shoot you?

22:30.807 --> 22:34.978
-But you made the drop though, right?
-Did I make the drop? You fucking idiot.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.939
-You didn't tell me where the drop was!
-It's eight o'clock. It's almost 8:00.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.274
-I know.
-It's 7:55.

22:39.357 --> 22:42.069
I know what time it is, Clay!
Shut the fuck up!

22:42.152 --> 22:43.570
-Where's the drop?
-I don't know.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.572
He's supposed to give you the spot.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.115
Man, I knew this fucking guy
was gonna pull something.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.576
Oh, you knew he was gonna pull something,
but you don't know him? What's his name?

22:49.659 --> 22:51.745
I don't know him. He's a Jefferson
Avenue guy. That's all I know.

22:51.828 --> 22:54.456
Yeah, I know fucking Jeff Ave,
motherfucker! He's a West End guy.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.000
-What is his name?
-I don't know who he is.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.753
-I only talked to him on the phone.
-You should be attached to his hip.

22:59.836 --> 23:03.423
I just set it up for him. I don't--
I don't wanna know the guy any more than--

23:03.507 --> 23:05.050
-oh, fuck me.
-Yeah, fuck you.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.260
-Fuck me. I know. Fuck me.
-Fuck you, Clay. Listen to me.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.804
Listen to me.
Are you setting me up, bro?

23:08.887 --> 23:11.848
No, I am not setting you up.
He's gonna call you with the drop.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.058
Yeah, since when?

23:13.141 --> 23:14.184
-I...
-Since when?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.811
You don't know the fucking ball
from the bounce.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.437
You're either too dumb
and you don't know it,

23:17.521 --> 23:20.899
or you're fucking dumber
and you're trying to fucking set me up!

23:21.399 --> 23:22.734
-Those weren't--
- Why didn't you use your crew?

23:22.818 --> 23:25.570
Those weren't even my guys.
He'll call you with the drop, okay?

23:25.654 --> 23:29.449
-You make the drop, we finish this.
-Motherfucker. You motherfucker.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.409
You let him put two strangers in the car.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.453
-Well... I didn't know that.
-How long we go back?

23:33.537 --> 23:36.373
How long we go back?
They were gonna fucking clip me, Clay.

23:36.456 --> 23:37.499
-You didn't know that?
-No.

23:37.582 --> 23:40.168
You didn't know that? I got a call
from somebody else. Did you know that?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.796
-What? Who?
-Oh, "What? Who?" I don't know.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.882
Somebody fucking texted me
that you and I were dead.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.093
You and I were dead.
You got any ideas, Clay?

23:48.176 --> 23:50.387
-I don't know.
-Say you don't know again, motherfucker!

23:50.470 --> 23:53.223
Say you don't know again! I'm gonna
fucking tattoo it on your forehead.

23:53.306 --> 23:56.143
You borrowed that money.
You went into the hole with them, not me.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.228
-You chill.
-[yells] Don't you tell me to chill!

23:58.311 --> 24:00.480
I gotta get this fucking car
off the road, you hear me?

24:00.564 --> 24:03.233
I haven't been out a year,
not a fucking year!

24:03.316 --> 24:06.695
-You gotta fix this, Clay!
-I'm gonna fix this. I'm gonna fix this.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.697
He'll call you.
You make the drop, and we're done.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.990
Fuck off!

24:15.912 --> 24:18.373
-Fuck!
-[ringtone playing]

24:23.170 --> 24:25.881
Put him on the phone.
Put him on the phone, Kate.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.091
Dad, I'm not gonna talk to you
when you're this angry.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.136
I'm not angry. I just wanna talk to Ryan.
It's okay. Put him on the phone.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.721
[Ryan]  No. I don't want to talk to him.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.182
-Hello?
-Ryan.

24:35.265 --> 24:36.308
Yeah?

24:36.391 --> 24:39.227
I wanna talk to you about being in my home
alone with my daughter.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.105
-You listening?
-Yeah.

24:42.189 --> 24:46.776
Okay. Our family is going through
a bit of a rough patch at the moment,

24:46.860 --> 24:48.612
and what Katie really needs
right now, Ryan,

24:48.695 --> 24:50.530
what she really needs is a good friend.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.074
I love my daughter more than my own life,
do you understand?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.911
More than my life. More than your life.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.496
-Are we clear?
-Yeah.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.208
-You're sure?
-Yeah, yeah.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.710
-We're just gonna watch a movie.
-You're gonna watch a movie?

25:03.793 --> 25:05.921
That sounds great.
And you'll be home by nine o'clock, yeah?

25:06.004 --> 25:09.758
-Yeah.
-Good. Put Kate back on.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.094
-[Kate]  Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.765
So, he's gonna watch a movie with you,
and then he's gonna leave at nine o'clock.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.600
Okay.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.769
-Do I need to say anything else?
-No.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.772
-You sure? Problem solved?
-Yes.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.691
Okay. See you in a little bit.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.962
[ringtone playing]

25:48.338 --> 25:49.756
Yeah?

25:49.839 --> 25:51.174
[handler]
Take the delivery road to the left.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.301
[faint jazz music playing]

25:55.679 --> 25:58.139
You know, I'm really sick
of your fucking music.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.808
[handler chuckles]

26:02.602 --> 26:05.480
-How far up?
-Go all the way up around the ramp.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.074
-Straight around?
-Just keep going straight.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.994
Take the right, go all the way down.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.677
Where do you want me to make this drop?

26:35.760 --> 26:37.971
[handler]  You're not making a drop.
You're gonna make an exchange.

26:38.054 --> 26:41.516
Fuck that. Just tell me where to drop
the money. I'm not making an exchange.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.435
Go to the bottom.
There's a loading dock.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.312
[line beeping]

26:46.730 --> 26:47.605
Hello?

26:49.149 --> 26:50.025
Fuck.

[mutters]
Fuck, fuck.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.295
[man] He's here.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.174
Fuck.

27:17.093 --> 27:18.178
[engine roars]

27:18.511 --> 27:20.472
[man] Hey, get ready.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.726
-[man] Hey!
-[tires screech]

27:24.809 --> 27:27.354
[man] Come back here!

27:27.437 --> 27:29.189
Fuck you, you asshole!

27:30.565 --> 27:31.483
[snaps] Fuck!

27:42.327 --> 27:45.622
[Wheelman] Exchange? Exchange, my ass.
It was a fucking buy.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.999
-A buy?
-A drug buy, Clay.

27:48.083 --> 27:48.917
With who?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.253
I don't know, Clay. Who gives a shit?
I'm not running drugs.

27:52.337 --> 27:57.008
Oh, listen, man, I think--
let's not rock the boat on this thing.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.135
-Did you know about this?
-No.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.179
-You set this up?
-No, I didn't do that.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.140
-I'm trying to get us out of this.
-I think you're full of shit, Clay.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.893
[Clay sighs]  Okay, then you tell me
what you want me to do.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.938
What I want? You set it up.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.107
If you won't do the buy,
I don't know what to do.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.861
Find someone to do the buy, Clay.

28:16.945 --> 28:20.949
-Someone else?
-Yeah, someone else. Call around.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.159
Find another jerk-off driver
to make this buy.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.955
-Get me out of it.
-All right, okay. Shit, I'll do it.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.707
-Good.
-No, I mean, I'll-- okay, I'll do it.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.875
Yeah, make the calls.

28:30.959 --> 28:34.671
-No, I'm gonna do the buy.
-You are?

28:34.754 --> 28:36.673
Just bring me the fucking car.
I'll do it. You're out.

28:36.756 --> 28:39.175
-I'm not bringing you this car.
-You're not?

28:39.259 --> 28:42.470
-No, I'm not.
-Well, you put me in a spot here, man.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.556
-Oh, I put you in a spot?
-Yeah.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.184
What do you want me to tell him? Do you
know what's gonna happen if I call them?

28:48.268 --> 28:51.146
-Tell me who he is. Tell me who he is.
-What? No. Why do you care who he is?

28:51.229 --> 28:54.065
Why do I care? 'Cause it's my ass
on the line with the West End guys.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.734
I owe 'em money. It's my ass!

28:57.193 --> 29:00.238
I wanna know who I'm fucking dealing with.
I want a name, I want a number.

29:01.114 --> 29:04.534
-I'll tell him you stole the money.
-You what?

29:04.617 --> 29:06.911

42:19.036 --> 42:21.121
I can't go to the Philly guy empty-handed.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.710

Does it look
like I switched out the cars, Clay?

43:48.917 --> 43:50.502
[Clay] Uh...

43:51.170 --> 43:52.880
I really need that fucking money.

43:54.048 --> 43:58.802
-I'm sorry.
-Clay! Clay! Don't--

43:58.886 --> 44:01.305
Fuck! Clay!

44:01.722 --> 44:03.265
-[gunshot pops]
-Agh!

44:03.849 --> 44:05.309
Fuck!

44:05.392 --> 44:07.478
Motherfuck!

44:07.561 --> 44:09.313
Jesus Christ.

44:09.396 --> 44:11.857
[Wheelman]
What did you do? What did you do?

44:11.940 --> 44:15.527
[Clay, slurring]
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

44:17.696 --> 44:20.783
Oh... oh, boy, I'm fucked up.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.868
-Clay?
-I'm fucked--

44:22.951 --> 44:25.954
-Clay?
-I'm fucked.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.498
-Fuck.
-[Clay grunting]

44:27.581 --> 44:29.541
-Help-- help me.
-Fuck.

44:29.625 --> 44:32.044
-Help me.
-I can't, Clay. I can't.

44:32.127 --> 44:34.463
[Clay grunting]

44:34.546 --> 44:37.508
Who is he? What's his name? What's
the West End guy's name, Clay? Tell me.

44:37.591 --> 44:39.051
-I wanna go.
-Tell me, Clay.

44:39.134 --> 44:41.261
-I wanna get out.
-Clay?

44:41.345 --> 44:44.056
-[babbling]
-You don't have time. Clay, listen to me.

44:44.139 --> 44:45.599
[grunting]

44:45.683 --> 44:48.852
-[panting]
-Clay?

44:50.187 --> 44:51.939
[door handle rattles]

44:52.022 --> 44:53.607
[babbling]

44:55.275 --> 44:58.028
-[sighs]
-[gasps]

44:58.112 --> 44:59.113
Clay?

45:02.366 --> 45:03.325
Clay?

45:05.077 --> 45:07.996
[mutters]
Fuck. Fuck.

45:09.331 --> 45:10.833
[groans]

45:23.053 --> 45:24.221
[thumps]

45:29.685 --> 45:31.270
[engine starts]

45:58.881 --> 46:00.466
[sighs]

46:45.052 --> 46:47.012
[ringtone playing]

46:50.474 --> 46:51.850
Yeah.

46:51.934 --> 46:55.312
[Philly]  When I said I knew you,
I meant I know everything about you.

46:55.395 --> 46:57.272
I know you're not a pro driver.

46:57.356 --> 47:00.150
You're a weekend racer.
You're an amateur.

47:00.234 --> 47:03.153
I know you did three years
for that warehouse fire.

47:03.237 --> 47:06.698
And I know you've borrowed a lot of money
for your family during that time.

47:07.866 --> 47:10.077
You're just a regular guy.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.704
You do what you have to do
for your family, right?

47:14.164 --> 47:17.960
And I know you got a wife
and daughter.

47:18.043 --> 47:19.586
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?

47:22.339 --> 47:23.382
[line rings]

47:29.137 --> 47:31.598
[recording]  Hey, what's up? This is Katie.
Leave me a message, and I'll call you--

47:34.476 --> 47:36.144
[line rings]

47:37.229 --> 47:38.981
Come on, Katie.
Come on, Katie, pick up.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.816
[line rings]

47:44.611 --> 47:45.904
Kate?

47:46.780 --> 47:47.698
Kate...?

47:48.657 --> 47:50.117
-You okay?
-No.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.577
What's wrong?

47:52.119 --> 47:53.120
What's wrong?

47:55.706 --> 47:58.792
Dad, I talked to Mom, and this sucks.

47:59.251 --> 48:01.795
Okay, yeah, I know. I know it sucks.
I know it sucks, but listen--

48:01.878 --> 48:03.797
-Dad, Mom is gonna take custody.
-She's not--

48:03.880 --> 48:05.132
-She said you blew it.
-I didn't--

48:05.215 --> 48:07.050
-You did.
-Look, she's not taking--

48:07.134 --> 48:09.553
she can't do that.
Your mom just gets like this, okay?

48:09.636 --> 48:11.888
You left me alone,
and you knew she would do this.

48:11.972 --> 48:15.142
II know. know. I screwed up, all right?
I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna make it right.

48:15.225 --> 48:17.477
All right? But I need you
to do something for me.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.229
I need you to leave the house, okay?

48:19.313 --> 48:21.398
-What do you mean?
-I want you-- I want Ryan--

48:21.481 --> 48:23.358
tell Ryan to drive you up
to Uncle Rich's house.

48:23.442 --> 48:25.819
-What?
-Have him take you to Uncle Rich's house.

48:25.902 --> 48:29.031
Dad, Ryan went home. What's going on?

48:30.991 --> 48:33.910
-You're home alone?
-Ryan left like you said.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.038
All right, I need you
to do something for me.

48:36.121 --> 48:37.122
-What?
-Can you hear me?

48:37.205 --> 48:39.207
-I want you to take my car somewhere.
-Your car?

48:39.291 --> 48:42.961
Yes. I want you to get in the Porsche
and go to the garage on Grand Street.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.172
-You know where that is?
-I'm not allowed to drive on the road.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.715
You are now, sweetheart, okay?

48:46.798 --> 48:49.343
It's just like driving on the track.
You've done it 50 times.

48:49.426 --> 48:51.094
Only go a little bit slower,
You take your time.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.929
Dad, what's going on?
Why are you being like this?

48:53.013 --> 48:55.474
Listen to me, do you remember
where the garage is on Grant?

48:55.557 --> 48:57.893
-Next to the shoe store? You remember?
-Yeah.

48:57.976 --> 49:00.812
Okay, I want you to take my car there.
I want you to go to level five.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.356
-Okay.
-Okay?

49:02.439 --> 49:03.357
-Oh, Dad.
-Yeah?

49:03.440 --> 49:05.442
-Where are the keys?
-The keys?

49:06.526 --> 49:08.695
Oh, shit, I got the keys.
I got the keys.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.864
You have them?
What am I supposed to do?

49:12.366 --> 49:15.410
Uh, check the drawer by the sink.

49:15.494 --> 49:18.914
The left drawer by the sink
that's all the pens and the stuff and--

49:18.997 --> 49:20.123
-The shit drawer?
-The shit drawer.

49:20.207 --> 49:21.750
Check the shit drawer, baby.
Go, hurry up.

49:21.833 --> 49:23.335
-I'm gonna stay on the phone. Go.
-Okay.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.798
-Come on, come on.
-[Kate]  Okay.

49:28.632 --> 49:30.133
Kate?

49:30.217 --> 49:31.927
[clattering]

49:34.388 --> 49:37.015
-Kate?
-Yeah, I don't see them, Dad.

49:37.099 --> 49:40.310
Shit. All right, listen,
just leave the house.

49:40.394 --> 49:42.979
I want you to walk
out of the house and go--

49:43.063 --> 49:44.231
-Found them.
-You got them?

49:44.314 --> 49:46.400
-Yeah.
-You sure it's the right keys?

49:46.483 --> 49:48.902
-Yeah.
-Okay, listen to me. Get in the car.

49:48.985 --> 49:51.279
You take your time.
You can do this.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.365
-Okay.
-All right? And I'll meet you there.

49:53.448 --> 49:54.783
-Bye, Dad.
-All right, babe, bye.

49:55.492 --> 49:58.370
[line beeping, ringing]

50:04.876 --> 50:08.088
-[Jessica]  What do you want?
-Hey, listen, I need you to do me a favor

50:08.171 --> 50:10.090
-and go meet Katie somewhere.
-For what?

50:10.173 --> 50:11.508
Just-- can you just go meet her, please--?

50:11.591 --> 50:15.053
-No. Why? Are you in the car?
-Jess.

50:15.137 --> 50:16.847
-Jess--
-Oh, my God. My God.

50:16.930 --> 50:20.308
Of course, you're in the car.
Of course, you're driving.

50:20.392 --> 50:22.144
-It's not paying for your family anymore.
-Jess--

50:22.227 --> 50:27.107
You're addicted. You can't not do it.
You know you could just work at a garage

50:27.190 --> 50:28.191
and be home with your daughter right now.

50:28.275 --> 50:29.735
-Jess?
-But, no. No, that's not for you...

50:29.818 --> 50:32.821
Hey, Jess, hey, Jess-- hey, Jess,
could you shut the fuck up for a second?

50:32.904 --> 50:35.323
This is serious!
I need you to fucking do me a favor!

50:35.407 --> 50:36.992
I need you to go get her.
All right?

50:37.075 --> 50:38.785
I need you to leave the house.
Can you do that?

50:38.869 --> 50:40.579
-Fuck you! I can't get her tonight.
-Jess.

50:40.662 --> 50:43.331
Okay? I can't get her tonight.
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.333
-And I left you a message.
-I know.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.711
-What do you mean "no"?
-No, I said "I know." I said I know.

50:47.794 --> 50:50.881
I got the message. Just do me a favor,
and just go pick her up, please.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.842
Yeah, I'm, I'm-- hang on!

50:53.925 --> 50:55.844
What? No hang on. Don't go anywhere.
Jess, don't go anywhere.

50:55.927 --> 50:57.471
-Could you just hang on, please?
-Don't--

50:57.554 --> 50:59.222
Jess, I need you to leave the house.

50:59.306 --> 51:02.225
-I gotta get the door. Hang on.
-Just go now.

51:02.309 --> 51:03.769
Jess?

51:05.395 --> 51:06.688
Fuck. Jess!

51:07.564 --> 51:09.691
-Pick up the phone! Son of a--
-[Jess screaming]

51:09.775 --> 51:12.152
-[man]  Get her to the car!
-Stop it! No!

51:12.235 --> 51:13.862
-Jess!
-[man]  Shut your fucking mouth!

51:13.945 --> 51:16.198
-Jess! Fuck!
-[beeping]

51:36.218 --> 51:37.385
[engine stops]

51:48.563 --> 51:50.398
[ringtone playing]

51:55.612 --> 51:57.489
[Philly]
You bring me that money now, yes?

51:59.449 --> 52:01.243
I know you're not the guy.

52:02.202 --> 52:05.372
You bring me that money
or you can listen to get her fucked!

52:05.455 --> 52:06.706
I'll fuck her myself.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.126
-I'll fuck her.
-Okay.

52:10.210 --> 52:11.461
Where are you?

52:12.838 --> 52:14.756
-I'm at 32nd.
- Where?

52:15.590 --> 52:18.468
-Near the tracks. Let me talk to her.
-Stop the car right there.

52:18.552 --> 52:22.347
Stop the car right there!
I'll have someone there in two minutes.

52:23.014 --> 52:24.015
-[line beeping]
-This will all be over--

52:25.517 --> 52:28.770
-I didn't hijack your job.
-[West End]  You motherfucker.

52:30.063 --> 52:31.898
Do you still have the money?

52:33.233 --> 52:34.401
Do you?

52:35.443 --> 52:37.320
-Yeah, I do.
-There's going to be fucking blood

52:37.404 --> 52:39.489
if that money doesn't come back
to me right now.

52:39.573 --> 52:40.824
He's got my wife.

52:42.492 --> 52:44.244
He's got my wife. You hear me?

52:46.121 --> 52:48.999
-All right, I could help.
-How?

52:51.293 --> 52:52.919
You start by bringing me the money.

52:54.170 --> 52:56.882
-You bring me that money, or I will--
-Or what?

52:56.965 --> 53:00.552
Or what? What? What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill me, huh? No shit.

53:00.635 --> 53:03.805
No shit, you're gonna kill me.
I'd fucking kill me.

53:03.889 --> 53:09.019
[West End]  He has no use for her--
other than to leverage you. That's it.

53:09.728 --> 53:12.314
You have the money. You're in control.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.525
If you let him get the upper hand,
he'll kill you both.

53:16.526 --> 53:19.029
-You have the money.
-I got a daughter!

53:19.112 --> 53:20.822
You fucking hear me? I got a daughter.

53:20.906 --> 53:24.534
He could fucking grab her, too.
He snatches her. That's what scares me.

53:24.618 --> 53:27.704
What the fuck scares you? The money?
Is that what it's about? The money?

53:27.787 --> 53:29.915
[West End]  It's not my money.
It's not my money.

53:29.998 --> 53:34.878
I guaranteed this job for someone else.
This is bigger than $200,000.

53:34.961 --> 53:38.423
Clay put this job together.
That shithead Clay sold it.

53:38.506 --> 53:40.800
This Philly motherfucker
targeted this job.

53:40.884 --> 53:44.137
He's taking a bite out of me
in front of every motherfucker in town.

53:44.220 --> 53:46.806
What do you think happens
if you give that cocksucker the money?

53:46.890 --> 53:49.893
What happens to my people?
To my family?

53:49.976 --> 53:51.645
This situation is a weapon.

53:51.728 --> 53:55.732
Me and mine will be eaten alive.
That's  what scares me.

53:55.815 --> 53:59.361
You're in over your head,
and I'm the guy that could pull you out.

54:00.278 --> 54:01.696
What's it gonna be?

54:02.656 --> 54:04.950
-I still owe on the three-year stretch.
-Yes.

54:05.033 --> 54:07.744
-You owe us a three-year stretch.
-Yeah.

54:07.827 --> 54:11.957
-And I can take care of that, too.
-Don't fucking "magic show" me here, man.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.333
Why should I trust you?

54:15.794 --> 54:18.546
-How old is she?
-Who?

54:18.630 --> 54:20.507
Your daughter, how old?

54:23.551 --> 54:25.387
-She's 13.
-Thirteen.

54:27.055 --> 54:29.766
You help me save my family,
and I'll help you save yours.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.313
-What are you gonna do?
-What do you think I'm gonna do?

54:35.397 --> 54:36.815
I'm gonna kill him.

54:41.111 --> 54:43.363
Okay. Okay.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.658
I got him on the other line.
What do I do?

54:46.741 --> 54:48.576
He's got my wife. He's got my wife.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.619
[West End]  All right.

54:50.578 --> 54:55.125
You set up an exchange. Just set it up
and tell me where. That's it.

54:57.627 --> 55:01.047
-Do not fuck me.
-Don't fuck  you?

55:02.090 --> 55:05.260
You got the money, pal.
You got the money.

55:05.927 --> 55:07.053
Okay.

55:08.013 --> 55:09.139
Okay.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.269
You still there?

55:14.352 --> 55:16.187
-[Philly]  What the fuck--?
-Let me talk to her.

55:16.271 --> 55:18.356
-You wanna talk to her?
-Let me fucking talk to her!

55:18.440 --> 55:21.317
You wanna talk to her alive,
you pull the fucking car over!

55:21.401 --> 55:23.319
And tell me where the fuck you are.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.281
You wanna listen to me fuck your wife
and cut her head off?

55:26.364 --> 55:28.950
-You're not gonna do shit.
-You have zero bargaining chips.

55:29.034 --> 55:32.787
Zero! I'll fucking kill this bitch.
Do you wanna see your wife again?

55:32.871 --> 55:36.583
Ex-wife, fuckface.
And I got your money, asshole.

55:47.218 --> 55:48.094
Come on.

55:54.726 --> 55:55.769
Come on.

56:01.316 --> 56:02.317
[mutters]
Fuck.

56:08.531 --> 56:10.366
[ringtone playing]

56:11.451 --> 56:14.454
You're gonna calm
the fuck down, huh? Say it.

56:14.537 --> 56:15.580
[Philly]  I'm calm.

56:16.706 --> 56:19.626
You want this money?
You better stop fucking around.

56:20.502 --> 56:21.669
First, I'm gonna talk to her.

56:21.753 --> 56:24.047
Then, I'm gonna tell you where we're gonna
make the exchange. Understand me?
