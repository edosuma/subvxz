00:03.878 --> 00:14.055
*

00:16.975 --> 00:18.560
Woman:
Here are the building materials.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.729
Please see that
the contractor receives them.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.605
Oh, and will you
email the client

00:22.647 --> 00:23.940
on the Higgins project?

00:23.982 --> 00:25.817
Let them know that
the model is ready for viewing.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.776
Thank you.

00:50.675 --> 00:51.593
(Phone pinging)

01:00.769 --> 01:01.728
Man: Hello!

01:01.770 --> 01:02.979
Uncle Karl.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.147
Karl: Ava.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.232
You've built
my favorite dream castle.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.902
Well, the exterior turned out
just like I imagined,

01:08.943 --> 01:12.739
but it's the interior that would
benefit from your expertise.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.908
Well, you can send me
the drawings if you'd like,

01:14.949 --> 01:16.201
I can take a look,

01:16.242 --> 01:19.704
but I am not
coming to Fríorland.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.747
Karl: Why not?

01:20.789 --> 01:22.248
Uh, my job, for one.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.251
Plus, I want to finalize
my sustainable housing pitch.

01:25.293 --> 01:28.171
Karl: Oh, right,
your passion project.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.757
Ava, I'm sure the firm
would approve of you

01:30.799 --> 01:32.300
taking this project on.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.803
It would bring them
good recognition,

01:34.844 --> 01:37.722
and more importantly,
it would do the same for you.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.265
You have grand visions

01:39.307 --> 01:41.351
and you have the talent
to bring them to life.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.562
And Fríorland's Royal Family
has their hands in projects

01:44.604 --> 01:45.772
all over the world.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.774
Who knows where this
might take your career?

01:51.653 --> 02:01.621
*

02:28.106 --> 02:29.190
Ava:
Thank you.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.652
(chuckling)

02:32.694 --> 02:33.862
- Ava!
- Hi!

02:33.903 --> 02:35.155
It's so good to see you.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.824
So good to see you,
Uncle Karl.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.702
So, what do you think
of the Winter Castle?

02:40.744 --> 02:42.704
This place is incredible.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.290
Your photo doesn't
even do it justice.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.334
Feels like
I'm in the North Pole.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.419
Not far off.
Let me show you around.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.712
There's work to be done.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.050
Ava: So, tell me more
about this tradition.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.468
I tried to look it up online,

02:56.509 --> 02:58.928
but I couldn't find
anything about it.

02:58.970 --> 03:03.683
Well, every year
since 1857,

03:03.725 --> 03:07.020
a winter castle has been built
for Fríorland's Royal Family

03:07.062 --> 03:09.397
right before Christmas.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.359
Different location every year.
No one knows where.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.236
But usually near
one of their royal manors.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.948
Yeah, it's meant to be
a getaway for the Royal Family.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.117
An escape.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.577
A place where
they can set aside

03:22.619 --> 03:24.204
the pressures of
their daily lives.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.830
Oh, I love that.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.377
Oh, and this day culminates
with the Royal Christmas Ball.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.338
Intimate affair,
mostly family,

03:33.380 --> 03:37.217
and whoever the Prince's
girlfriend is at the time.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.969
Oh, he's that
kind of prince, huh?

03:40.011 --> 03:42.138
Well, if you
believe the tabloids,

03:42.180 --> 03:44.557
but who am I to say?

03:44.599 --> 03:47.102
In our interactions
he's been very professional,

03:47.143 --> 03:48.520
if a little tightly wound,

03:48.561 --> 03:51.523
but he certainly
knows what he wants.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.484
He's requested a few
specs for the interior

03:54.526 --> 03:56.611
I could really use
your help with.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.947
Well, I'm happy
to help you.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.866
(sighing)
Ava, I, uh...

04:01.908 --> 04:04.411
feel like I might be in
over my head on this one.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.539
Ah, Uncle Karl,
come on.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.791
You got this
and I got you.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.669
Thank you, Ava.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.671
Your vote of confidence
means a lot.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.675
Wow, it's beautiful.

04:18.717 --> 04:19.801
Oh, yeah.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.680
And here we are,
back at the atrium.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.268
Who's this?

04:28.309 --> 04:30.228
That's Prince Henry.
You don't recognize him?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.813
Why would I recognize him?

04:31.855 --> 04:36.401
Karl: One of Society Magazine's
50 most eligible bachelors.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.445
(scoffs) Come on, you know
I don't follow that stuff.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.991
Well, it appears
that you recognize

04:43.033 --> 04:45.118
what all the fuss is about.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.328
Yeah, looks don't
make a man, Uncle Karl.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.706
Unfortunately, I had to
learn that the hard way.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.458
Excuse me?

04:51.499 --> 04:55.128
Mrs. Newton, this is my niece
I was telling you about.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.629
Ava, this is Brigitta.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.341
She's the director of operations
for the Royal Family.

04:59.382 --> 05:03.011
Hi, I'm Ava.
Ava Jensen. It's...

05:04.679 --> 05:05.722
Hi.

05:05.764 --> 05:09.434
Ava is a very
well-known architect.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.686
She has a creativity
and a talent

05:11.728 --> 05:14.689
that is unmatched
in our field.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.941
It will take far more than
that to please the Royal Family.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.777
Oh, Brigitta--

05:18.818 --> 05:20.403
Mrs. Newton.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.907
(clearing throat)
Mrs. Newton.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.409
I can assure you that
I'm simply here just to,

05:26.451 --> 05:29.788
um, help with the finishing
touches of my Uncle Karl's

05:29.829 --> 05:33.416
spectacular creation,
and I'm sure the Royal Family

05:33.458 --> 05:35.168
will be very pleased.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.671
Hm. Let's hope so.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.172
One more thing.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.883
Gawking at Prince Henry's
portrait is highly frowned upon.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.010
I wasn't gawking.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.887
Oh, your mouth
was agape.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.349
- (clearing throat)
- The highest level of decorum

05:49.391 --> 05:51.142
is expected of all of those

05:51.184 --> 05:52.894
in the presence of
the Royal Family.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.771
Of course.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.899
Good day.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.403
(chuckling)

06:01.444 --> 06:05.115
Wow, she's a breath of
frosty arctic air, isn't she?

06:05.156 --> 06:08.493
Uh, yes, but just please
don't ruffle her feathers.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.829
I'll do my best.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.706
Thank you, love.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.375
Now, let's get you
settled into your room.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.877
Good night's sleep.
Tomorrow's a big day.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.129
Mm-hm.

06:19.170 --> 06:28.138
*

06:30.056 --> 06:31.224
Man:
Nasty break-up.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.269
What do they know about it?

06:34.310 --> 06:36.646
Apparently everything.

06:36.688 --> 06:40.108
No, they just make
this stuff up. You know that.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.568
Be that as it may,
I don't believe

06:41.609 --> 06:43.069
it would require great effort
on your part

06:43.111 --> 06:46.156
to imagine how the king and
queen feel about this.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.241
They're the ones who
forced me into the relationship

06:48.283 --> 06:49.659
with Astrid to begin with.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.578
Forced is
a rather strong word.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.122
Lady Astrid is an educated
and worldly woman

06:54.164 --> 06:56.124
of the highest caliber.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.584
That's to say nothing
of her...

06:57.625 --> 07:00.587
(clearing throat)
...attractiveness.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.256
Are those the criteria
for an ideal spouse,

07:03.298 --> 07:04.758
Deputy Von Trier?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.468
I cannot say,
Your Highness.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.887
As you're aware,
despite being well into my 40s,

07:08.928 --> 07:12.766
marriage has,
as of yet, eluded me.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.560
Well, don't give up,
my friend.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.438
Your soulmate's
out there somewhere.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.856
Thank you,
Your Highness.

07:19.898 --> 07:23.443
But if I may return to
the pressing issues at hand,

07:23.485 --> 07:24.986
damage control, and...

07:27.322 --> 07:28.782
And?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.451
And, now that you and Astrid
are no longer together,

07:31.493 --> 07:34.621
who you intend to ask
to the Christmas Ball.

07:36.414 --> 07:43.672
*

07:45.173 --> 07:46.675
Your home
away from home.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.886
Ava:
It's like a dream.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.308
(chuckling)

07:55.350 --> 07:58.895
I remembered how much you liked
teddy bears when you were a kid.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.854
It's a polar bear.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.650
(both chuckling)

08:03.692 --> 08:13.660
*

08:26.548 --> 08:28.341
Henry, how are things
shaping up

08:28.383 --> 08:30.176
for our time
at the Winter Castle?

08:30.218 --> 08:33.680
Well, the annual address
to the nation is coming along.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.598
I have some
talking points at least,

08:35.640 --> 08:38.351
but still needs some work,
that's for sure.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.477
I'll get it done.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.312
(both clearing their throats)

08:41.354 --> 08:43.857
And is there something
else in need of shaping up?

08:43.898 --> 08:46.985
I think what your mother
is delicately getting at

08:47.027 --> 08:49.654
is do you have a date for
the winter ball or not?

08:49.696 --> 08:52.866
At this moment,
I do not.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.492
Henry.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.660
Maybe I don't want a date.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.204
Maybe it's best
I attend alone.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.831
I would not advise it.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.791
Nor would I,
Your Highness.

09:01.833 --> 09:02.751
Why?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.003
It opens you up
to speculation.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.796
Speculation?

09:06.838 --> 09:09.215
Of what?
That I'm single?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.760
That maybe you're unable
to find a woman worthy

09:11.801 --> 09:13.053
of one day becoming queen.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.723
(scoffing)
Well, so far that's been true.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.976
Thank you, Von Trier.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.644
Your Majesties.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.813
There'll be no press
at the winter castle.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.023
So, who's going
to speculate?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.901
Henry, you know how
these things get out.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.862
Well, let's not
worry too much.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.156
If you don't find a date,
I can help.

09:33.198 --> 09:36.117
I know of a lovely young lady
who's just moved back--

09:36.159 --> 09:38.453
Mother, come on, please.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.663
The two of you were
high school sweethearts.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.332
No one set you up.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.417
It just--
It was meant to be.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.753
Mother.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.047
You fell in love
with Dad

09:49.089 --> 09:52.050
before you even knew
he was future king.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.428
And Dad, you said
the moment you met Mother

09:55.470 --> 09:56.888
there was
an instant connection.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.098
Mm.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.059
Every word of what you
just said...

10:01.101 --> 10:02.769
is absolutely true.

10:02.811 --> 10:06.439
(both kissing, giggling)

10:06.481 --> 10:08.441
I just wish everyone
would just relax

10:08.483 --> 10:10.318
and give me a little space,
because...

10:12.529 --> 10:15.198
...maybe one day
I'll be lucky enough

10:15.240 --> 10:17.617
to find
what you two have.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.453
Give it time.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.038
We'll take our coats,
please!

10:24.499 --> 10:27.502
*

10:27.544 --> 10:30.380
(whirring)

10:30.422 --> 10:32.716
Okay, everyone!

10:32.757 --> 10:35.301
The moment of truth
is fast approaching.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.762
The Royal Family
is en route.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.557
Ava, have you ever
pulled it off!

10:40.598 --> 10:42.058
(chuckling)

10:42.100 --> 10:44.477
Yeah, I think it
turned out pretty well.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.313
Pretty well?
It turned out beautifully.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.357
And just in time.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.359
The Royal Family's
going to be here any minute.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.154
Oh, good. I want to show you
this one thing over here.

10:54.195 --> 10:58.074
Um, the gradient there, it might
need a little bit of work.

10:58.116 --> 11:08.084
*

11:18.219 --> 11:20.347
(blowing horn)

11:20.388 --> 11:29.564
*

11:29.606 --> 11:32.734
Oh, my goodness.
They've outdone themselves.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.278
Hi, I'm Ava.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.571
Hi, I'm Maria.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.074
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.700
So, you work with
the Royal Family?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.702
I do.
I assist with their travel.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.330
Well, then you
must know Brigitta.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.123
She's my boss.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.208
(chuckling)

11:48.249 --> 11:49.584
She's a lovely lady.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.919
(laughing)

11:50.960 --> 12:00.929
*

12:04.766 --> 12:06.309
Mr. Jensen.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.811
Prince Henry.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.270
(clearing throat)

12:13.441 --> 12:16.111
What you've built here
is absolutely marvelous.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.072
I couldn't imagine a more
perfect Winter Castle.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.949
I'm overjoyed that you like it,
Your Highness,

12:20.990 --> 12:23.034
and I hope
you enjoy your stay.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.374
Yes, I believe I will.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.919
Prince Henry.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.005
Ah, Mrs. Newton.
How do you do?

12:35.046 --> 12:37.048
And who's that
with them there?

12:37.090 --> 12:40.051
Oh, that's Sigrid.
Brigitta's daughter.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.429
We think she's secretly
plotting to get her

12:42.470 --> 12:43.722
together with Prince Henry.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.056
Really?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.516
Mm-hm.
I mean, we all thought

12:46.558 --> 12:47.976
he'd make Astrid a princess,
but--

12:48.018 --> 12:49.269
And which one is Astrid?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.938
Prince Henry's girlfriend--
Uh, or, ex.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.441
He just broke it off
with her,

12:54.482 --> 12:56.317
and now he's single again.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.654
Do you remember
my daughter, Sigrid?

12:59.696 --> 13:03.116
Yes, of course.
Sigrid.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.744
Last time I saw you,
we were children

13:05.785 --> 13:07.996
if I remember correctly.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.248
Yes, we were 10.
(chuckling)

13:10.290 --> 13:14.169
The same year my mother started
working for the Royal Family.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.505
You may recall she attended
boarding school with the queen.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.923
Yes, I'm aware.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.385
Sigrid was sent
to Tasis at Lugano

13:22.427 --> 13:25.388
after her father died
and I was full-time in service.

13:25.430 --> 13:29.559
Well, you've grown into
a beautiful woman since then.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.519
Thank you.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.480
We may be watching
history unfold.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.856
He looks
rather enamored.

13:36.858 --> 13:40.195
Sigrid just completed
her degree at the Sorbonne

13:40.236 --> 13:44.240
and has decided to move back
to Fríorland full-time.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.159
Oh, is that right?

13:46.201 --> 13:47.118
Mm-hm.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.292
Shall we all go inside?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.418
- Yes.
- Yes.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.253
Wonderful.
Come, darling.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.506
Shall we?

14:06.262 --> 14:07.222
Thank you.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.442
This is wonderful.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.985
You are pleased?

14:21.027 --> 14:24.614
Well, it might be the coolest
room I've ever stayed in.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.409
Excuse the pun.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.327
(woman chuckling politely)

14:29.369 --> 14:30.787
- (chuckling)
- Sigrid: That's funny.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.372
Yes, well...

14:32.414 --> 14:35.500
We will leave you be then,
Your Highness.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.257
Unless, uh, there's any
other way I can be of service.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.221
- I...
- Oh.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.848
I, um--

14:49.889 --> 14:52.392
No, I-- I think I'm all set,
Sigrid, thank you.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.185
Very well.

14:54.227 --> 14:58.481
Well, I-- I hope to see you
again shortly, Your Highness.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.524
Yes.

15:00.567 --> 15:10.535
*

15:12.537 --> 15:13.455
(chuckling)

15:22.255 --> 15:23.548
Excuse me?

15:23.590 --> 15:24.924
(gasping)

15:24.966 --> 15:27.635
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.055
Sorry, I just, uh--

15:30.096 --> 15:33.099
I get a little jumpy when
people sneak up from behind me.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.602
Well, I really am sorry.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.103
It's okay.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.232
You're the niece
of Karl Jensen?

15:41.274 --> 15:44.611
An architect yourself,
I was told.

15:44.652 --> 15:48.323
You are inquiring
about me?

15:48.365 --> 15:50.158
Well, I know everyone
else here,

15:50.200 --> 15:52.952
and, uh, our stay at
the Winter Castle

15:52.994 --> 15:53.912
is an intimate affair.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.206
Oh, uh, of course.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.125
But you I haven't
met yet.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.170
Ava.

16:03.338 --> 16:04.255
Delighted.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.842
Your uncle has done
some wonderful work for us

16:07.884 --> 16:09.469
over the years.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.054
That's why we
commissioned him to design

16:11.096 --> 16:12.472
this year's Winter Castle.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.933
Ava: Well, thank you.
He's incredibly grateful.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.476
We both are.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.104
I think it's wonderful
that you can both

16:19.145 --> 16:22.482
work on such a unique
project together.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.942
You know, it's strange.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.611
It's almost like fate has
brought us here to do this.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.654
Fate?

16:27.696 --> 16:28.613
Ava:
Mm-hm.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.365
How so?

16:30.407 --> 16:32.492
Well, when I was a little kid,
we used to build snow castles

16:32.534 --> 16:35.745
together in
the backyard over Christmas.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.163
Really?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.290
(chuckling)
In fact they were a little bit

16:39.332 --> 16:41.543
taller than you,
but as a little kid

16:41.584 --> 16:43.545
they seemed like they were
gigantic,

16:43.586 --> 16:45.880
and I remember just sitting
inside of them

16:45.922 --> 16:49.134
and I would just dream about
being a princess

16:49.175 --> 16:51.678
off away in a winter
wonderland.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.098
Hm. It's one of
my favorite holiday memories.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.895
Sorry, I... (clearing throat)
...I'm oversharing.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.314
No, not at all.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.070
Um, your uncle said
that, uh,

17:09.112 --> 17:12.157
this ice slide
was your design.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.785
Yes. Yes, it is.
You want to give it a try?

17:15.827 --> 17:17.954
Oh, no. No, no.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.165
I thought you were
the one that requested it.

17:20.206 --> 17:24.210
Um, no, no.
For the children of course.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.713
Well, you're never
too old to go down a slide.

17:26.755 --> 17:27.756
Come on.

17:29.841 --> 17:30.884
Uh...

17:30.925 --> 17:32.969
- Ava: It'll be fun.
- Ah.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.388
Ava: Just follow me up
these stairs.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.806
- Wow, this is...
- Watch your head.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.058
...incredible.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.518
And you'll sit
right directly behind me.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.479
- Sit right behind you.
- Yes. Careful.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.482
*

17:45.523 --> 17:47.108
Prince Henry:
Just down here?

17:49.778 --> 17:50.987
Ready? One, two--

17:51.029 --> 17:51.946
Two.

17:51.988 --> 17:52.989
Three!

17:53.031 --> 17:55.075
- Oh!
- Whoa!

17:55.116 --> 17:56.910
- (laughing)
- Whoa, it's got some speed.

17:56.951 --> 17:57.911
(screaming)

17:57.952 --> 17:58.828
(both laughing)

17:58.870 --> 18:00.205
Whoa!

18:00.246 --> 18:02.040
(both laughing)

18:02.082 --> 18:03.541
That was fantastic.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.793
Oh.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.421
(chuckling nervously)

18:08.463 --> 18:09.255
Von Trier.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.840
- Prince Henry.
- Yes.

18:10.882 --> 18:14.219
Your presence has been requested
by Her Majesty the Queen.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.764
We have some scheduling to
review back at the royal manor,

18:17.806 --> 18:19.891
but now it's time for
the annual Christmas photo.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.268
Oh, of course it is.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.145
Please tell them
I'm on my way.

18:25.647 --> 18:26.981
Thank you.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.316
- Sorry.
- (chuckling)

18:28.358 --> 18:30.652
Duty calls, Ms. Jensen.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.948
But it has been
an absolute pleasure.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.867
Mm, Your Highness.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.786
See you soon.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.415
I'll see you.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.671
*

18:54.092 --> 18:58.680
*

18:58.722 --> 19:02.642
(camera clicking)

19:04.144 --> 19:13.319
*

19:15.030 --> 19:16.322
Uncle Karl: Ava.

19:16.364 --> 19:20.201
Sweetheart,
so glad I found you.

19:20.243 --> 19:23.288
- We need to talk.
- What's the matter?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.290
There's been some rumblings
among the staff

19:25.331 --> 19:27.917
that the Prince may have
a thing for you.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.295
What type of a thing?

19:30.337 --> 19:31.629
An interest.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.132
Apparently he took
an immediate liking to you.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.134
(laughing)

19:36.176 --> 19:38.136
That's ridiculous.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.679
I know you're
a humble young lady,

19:39.721 --> 19:43.558
but anyone with any sense could
see why that might be true.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.728
My personal policy is to
not mingle with the royals,

19:46.770 --> 19:49.773
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.233
And I'm not telling you
how to live your life.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.652
You're an adult,
you can make your own decisions.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.864
I guess I'm just
saying to be careful.

19:57.906 --> 20:02.285
A slight misstep could
have disastrous consequences

20:02.327 --> 20:03.661
for both of us.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.998
Uncle Karl,
I can assure you

20:07.040 --> 20:11.378
that my loyalty is to you
and my career, I promise.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.338
(chuckling)

20:13.380 --> 20:17.342
You've grown into such
a wise and talented woman.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.928
As I knew you would.

20:19.969 --> 20:20.970
I gotta run.

20:22.514 --> 20:23.973
- Love you.
- Love you.

20:24.015 --> 20:24.974
Okay.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.519
(chuckling)

20:29.437 --> 20:33.441
A moment, Ms. Jensen.
Please.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.444
Brigitta, I didn't
see you over there,

20:36.486 --> 20:37.946
otherwise I would
have stopped

20:37.987 --> 20:40.615
and happily exchanged,
um, pleasantries.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.576
You weren't planning
on retiring?

20:43.618 --> 20:45.036
Maybe.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.788
Considering the lucrative
contract you are being paid

20:46.830 --> 20:50.291
for your creative services,
I hope you understand

20:50.333 --> 20:53.253
that you are on call,
as you Americans say.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.296
Of course. Yes.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.132
Uh, what did you
have in mind?

20:57.173 --> 21:01.553
I have a job that requires
your creativity and talents.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.723
Please, do tell.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.682
Hm.

21:08.601 --> 21:14.566
*

21:14.607 --> 21:16.693
Housing for
the royal pooches?

21:16.735 --> 21:21.823
Mm, Bjorn, Grom,
Knud, Toke, and Ulf.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.491
Go on.

21:23.533 --> 21:24.701
Write it down.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.496
Oh, uh...

21:30.957 --> 21:32.500
(clearing throat)

21:32.542 --> 21:36.588
And you said that there's,
um, five-- five of them?

21:36.629 --> 21:37.881
Yes.

21:37.922 --> 21:41.259
And they each need
their own separate dwelling?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.886
Is that a problem?

21:42.927 --> 21:45.472
No, no. Not at all. It's just
none of this was in the plans.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.891
It was a last minute
addition.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.642
The king and queen
weren't planning on bringing

21:49.684 --> 21:52.479
the royal pooches,
but I said, "You must!

21:52.520 --> 21:54.814
They will be
in their element."

21:54.856 --> 21:58.276
And they said,
"Brigitta, you are right,

21:58.318 --> 21:59.986
as it is your habit
to be."

22:01.654 --> 22:03.865
The pooches arrive
in three days from now.

22:03.907 --> 22:06.284
You can use whatever
you need in the warehouse.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.244
As for workers
to help you build,

22:08.286 --> 22:09.996
well, I must leave that
to you.

22:10.038 --> 22:12.624
I don't think that there's going
to be much time to do this.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.959
Not much time
at all.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.004
I expect this will consume you
from this moment forward.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.759
Good day, Ms. Jensen,
and good luck.

22:22.801 --> 22:26.179
Knud?
How do you even spell that?

22:28.431 --> 22:38.608
*

22:47.659 --> 22:51.746
It appeared Prince Henry was
captivated by the ravishing

22:51.788 --> 22:54.666
Sigrid Newton, who only
recently returned to Fríorland

22:54.708 --> 22:56.793
after graduating
from Sorbonne.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.920
As the daughter
of Brigitta Newton,

22:58.962 --> 23:01.047
a long-time member
of the royal staff,

23:01.089 --> 23:04.509
and daughter of
the late Duke Thorfinn Newton,

23:04.551 --> 23:07.554
she's accustomed to
the royal way of life.

23:07.595 --> 23:12.350
With Astrid cast out
it seems Sigrid is next up,

23:12.392 --> 23:14.602
and public opinion
is that she is

23:14.644 --> 23:17.022
very well suited to be
the future princess.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.735
I have a brief chat with a woman
and the press is ready

23:21.776 --> 23:23.528
to crown her the next queen.

23:23.570 --> 23:27.407
(laughing)
It's maddening.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.201
Well, the press did
have a keen observation.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.661
And what was that?

23:31.703 --> 23:34.372
That Sigrid is well-groomed
for this sort of life.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.459
I'd rather someone who's right
for me, not just this life.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.171
All I'm saying is it wouldn't
hurt to give Sigrid a chance.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.007
If you have common interests,
if your personalities mesh,

23:44.049 --> 23:45.967
you might ask her
to the Christmas Ball.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.970
(groaning)

23:49.012 --> 23:49.971
Von Trier.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.599
(sighing)

23:58.271 --> 23:59.230
Sigrid:
This is lovely.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.648
It is.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.402
You know,
when I was little

24:04.444 --> 24:06.112
I spent countless
hours thinking

24:06.154 --> 24:09.449
of what sort of princess
or queen I'd be.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.159
Did you?

24:11.201 --> 24:13.203
Of course,
all girls did.

24:13.244 --> 24:16.164
I think I'd want to be like
Queen Christina of Sweden.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.249
She was quite intellectual.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.335
Did you know she had
René Descartes in her court?

24:20.377 --> 24:23.421
Mm. Cogito, ergo sum.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.299
I think, therefore I am.

24:26.341 --> 24:30.303
Oui. Je pense donc je suis.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.554
(chuckling)

24:31.596 --> 24:33.682
He was quite incredible.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.267
I mean, first invented
analytical geometry,

24:36.309 --> 24:38.770
and then skepticism,
which is now an essential part

24:38.812 --> 24:41.022
of scientific theory.
I just--

24:41.064 --> 24:43.233
He was... amazing.

24:43.274 --> 24:47.862
Yes, but Queen Christina

24:47.904 --> 24:51.616
lived so extravagantly she
nearly bankrupted the country.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.326
Well, you can't
fault her for that.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.165
All right, well,
she was the most learned woman

24:59.207 --> 25:00.542
of the 17th century.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.420
Yes, she was in good company
with Marie Antoinette.

25:03.461 --> 25:04.879
Ah, now you're
touching on something

25:04.921 --> 25:07.132
that I despise
about monarchies.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.383
What is that?

25:08.425 --> 25:10.802
They have a history of
beheading their wives.

25:10.844 --> 25:13.304
Did you know that
King Henry VIII of England

25:13.346 --> 25:14.723
beheaded two of his wives?

25:14.764 --> 25:16.391
Yes, well, that is a rather
morbid bit of history.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.601
I suppose it's a good thing
monarchies frown upon

25:18.643 --> 25:20.311
such things these days.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.731
In all seriousness,
what would happen to a princess

25:22.772 --> 25:25.025
or queen if she didn't
give birth to a boy?

25:25.066 --> 25:29.112
Is she banished
in your country?

25:29.154 --> 25:32.991
No, the Royal Family would
celebrate the baby girl.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.367
Mm.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.202
Princess soon
to rule as queen.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.413
Just like
Queen Elizabeth in England.

25:40.206 --> 25:43.835
Kings aren't as important
as their title implies.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.796
What makes you
ask these questions?

25:48.256 --> 25:51.676
Well, I have 17 cousins,

25:51.718 --> 25:53.428
all but one are female,

25:53.470 --> 25:56.598
with six nieces,
no nephews.

25:56.639 --> 25:59.642
It seems it's in
my family's lot to have girls.

25:59.684 --> 26:01.102
You know what?

26:01.144 --> 26:03.355
I think we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.607
- Perhaps, yes.
- Yeah.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.776
(chuckling)

26:12.989 --> 26:14.282
(turkeys warbling)

26:14.324 --> 26:16.326
Ava: So, they're still
a work in progress,

26:16.368 --> 26:18.912
but I think they'll meet
the Royal Family's expectations.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.872
(chuckling)
They'll exceed them.

26:20.914 --> 26:24.209
In the field of architecture,
I am convinced you can do

26:24.250 --> 26:26.836
just about anything,
and do it exceptionally well.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.172
(chuckling)

26:29.214 --> 26:30.715
I also wanted to
design this gateway

26:30.757 --> 26:31.925
that frames the kennel area.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.051
Karl: Mm-hm.

26:33.093 --> 26:34.302
Ava: A design that really,
you know,

26:34.344 --> 26:36.304
embodies the local
environment.

26:36.346 --> 26:39.683
Oh, you should go take
a look in the chapel.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.519
It might give you
some ideas.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.020
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:44.062 --> 26:46.189
Hey, I would stay and help
if I didn't have to tend

26:46.231 --> 26:48.108
to every detail of
the Winter Castle.

26:48.149 --> 26:50.360
No, we're a team.

26:50.402 --> 26:52.570
That's why I'm here.
So, go.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.155
Focus on what you need to.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.198
- Okay, good.
- (phone ringing)

26:55.240 --> 26:56.032
Oh.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.450
(phone ringing)

26:57.492 --> 26:59.369
Deputy Von Trier.
I gotta run.

26:59.411 --> 27:01.246
Go, I got this.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.498
- All right.
- (phone ringing)

27:03.540 --> 27:06.710
Hello. No, I just stepped away
for a couple of minutes.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.087
I'll be right there.

27:10.588 --> 27:20.598
*

27:21.933 --> 27:22.851
(chuckling)

27:25.937 --> 27:27.105
Ms. Jensen.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.735
Hi.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.029
Sorry, I didn't--
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.322
No, please.
Join me if you have a moment.

27:39.701 --> 27:43.121
This, uh, this chapel
was built for my cousin.

27:43.163 --> 27:45.457
He's getting married here
after the holidays.

27:47.167 --> 27:50.920
His fiancée is such
a wonderful woman.

27:50.962 --> 27:53.006
They're a great couple.

27:53.048 --> 27:55.884
You know, the kind
of couples who seem

27:55.925 --> 27:59.137
to complement each other
so perfectly.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.680
Yeah, I have some
friends like that.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.223
Hm.

28:02.265 --> 28:06.436
Have you ever been in a
relationship yourself like that?

28:06.478 --> 28:09.064
Oh, no.

28:09.105 --> 28:10.440
Have you?

28:10.482 --> 28:12.942
Uh... no.

28:12.984 --> 28:14.277
Not yet.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.868
Interesting design,
isn't it?

28:21.910 --> 28:23.661
Yeah, it's so unique.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.288
It was my cousin's vision,

28:25.330 --> 28:26.873
but your uncle helped
execute it perfectly.

28:26.915 --> 28:28.124
Mm-hm.

28:28.166 --> 28:31.628
It's representative
of the landscape,

28:31.670 --> 28:34.089
which is very
important to our culture.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.966
Constantly in flux
and change.

28:37.008 --> 28:38.927
The snow, glaciers,

28:38.968 --> 28:42.138
and the storms that blow so hard
you can hardly see your hand

28:42.180 --> 28:43.765
when you hold it
in front of you.

28:43.807 --> 28:47.477
It's all part of what
makes us who we are.

28:47.519 --> 28:48.687
And who's that?

28:50.146 --> 28:51.731
Fríorlanders.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.983
- Yeah.
- Oh, uh. We are--

28:54.025 --> 28:56.569
We are strong
and resilient people.

28:56.611 --> 29:01.032
People that help each
other when times are tough.

29:01.074 --> 29:03.827
But we also
truly appreciate nature

29:03.868 --> 29:06.454
and will fight
to protect it.

29:06.496 --> 29:08.415
Isn't it interesting
how the landscape that

29:08.456 --> 29:10.458
we grow up around
really influences us?

29:10.500 --> 29:14.587
Where I grew up really inspired
my passion for architecture,

29:14.629 --> 29:16.923
especially for
sustainable housing.

29:16.965 --> 29:19.009
Where were you raised?

29:19.050 --> 29:21.052
- Minnesota.
- Minnesota.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.763
Uh, strong Nordic roots.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.223
Oh.
(chuckling)

29:25.265 --> 29:28.143
I'm kidding. I grew up
around snow and the cold, so.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.811
Well, you'll feel
very at home here, then.

29:29.853 --> 29:31.062
Your Highness?

29:31.104 --> 29:33.314
Oh, yes.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.859
There are a few
matters of varying urgency

29:35.900 --> 29:37.694
that require your attention.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.946
Always.

29:39.988 --> 29:40.905
Thank you.

29:42.490 --> 29:45.785
It's nice to see you again,
Ms. Jensen.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.871
Ava.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.748
You can call me Ava.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.250
Okay. Ava.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.752
I'll see you soon.

29:53.793 --> 30:03.762
*

30:06.556 --> 30:09.434
Queen:
Oh, do try to keep up, dear.

30:09.476 --> 30:12.020
I know you much prefer
the great indoors,

30:12.062 --> 30:14.105
but this is the reason
why we're here.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.733
For the invigoration
of it all!

30:16.775 --> 30:18.360
Yes, darling.

30:18.401 --> 30:21.529
Remember that I do love the
idea of cross-country skiing

30:21.571 --> 30:23.698
a bit more than
the activity itself,

30:23.740 --> 30:26.910
which I feel has been
vastly over-romanticized.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.328
(laughing)

30:30.330 --> 30:33.625
Now that we're all here,
just the three of us,

30:33.667 --> 30:35.418
I do feel like
it's absolutely wonderful.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.670
Aw.

30:36.711 --> 30:39.089
I don't think it was
just the three of us.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.423
(camera clicking)

30:40.465 --> 30:41.758
Apparently our
location was leaked.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.968
Must be the guy
who took the photo of me

30:44.010 --> 30:45.679
talking with Sigrid.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.263
Well, you know
how to handle this.

30:47.305 --> 30:49.224
Just ignore him.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.226
I've been doing that
my whole life, mother.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.353
It takes its toll.

30:53.395 --> 30:54.688
Well, come on, cheer up.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.232
This is a great opportunity for
outdoor sport

30:57.273 --> 31:00.110
and it is my favorite time
of the year.

31:00.151 --> 31:02.779
Mine too, Mother.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.739
And we have a lovely
dinner planned for tonight

31:04.781 --> 31:06.616
at the royal manor.

31:06.658 --> 31:09.452
A traditional meal,
great conversation,

31:09.494 --> 31:11.830
a glass of wine.
Just what you need.

31:11.871 --> 31:15.583
And we've invited
Sigrid as our guest.

31:15.625 --> 31:19.295
Just so the two of you
can be reacquainted.

31:19.337 --> 31:20.880
Well, we've already
been reacquainted.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.425
Oh, have you?

31:23.466 --> 31:25.510
We went for a walk together
arranged by Von Trier

31:25.552 --> 31:28.054
and orchestrated by
you and Brigitta I'm sure.

31:29.848 --> 31:31.850
And how did it go?

31:31.891 --> 31:33.560
Well, she wondered if
it'd be problematic

31:33.601 --> 31:35.353
if she only birthed females.

31:35.395 --> 31:36.771
(chuckling)

31:36.813 --> 31:38.314
Well, you can't fault
a girl for thinking ahead.

31:38.356 --> 31:39.566
Come on, Mother.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.818
Oh, she was
probably just nervous.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.486
Anyway, enough of this.

31:43.528 --> 31:45.321
There'll be plenty of time
to talk

31:45.363 --> 31:47.157
about all sorts of things
at dinner.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.992
You've been awfully
stressed lately.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.118
More so than normal.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.037
Yeah, I just have
a lot on my mind.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.497
Son, as a hereditary royal,

31:54.539 --> 31:57.250
you above all people
know our obligations.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.044
We must keep up
our traditions.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.421
We're a small,
but vital country.

32:01.463 --> 32:03.214
What do we have,
if we don't have tradition?

32:03.256 --> 32:06.718
And we do understand that it
can be overwhelming at times.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.553
Yes, but you must
be able to control it

32:08.595 --> 32:10.180
and the impact it has on you.

32:10.221 --> 32:12.015
Oh, easier said than done.

32:12.057 --> 32:14.100
Yes.

32:14.142 --> 32:15.477
Well, so is
cross-country skiing,

32:15.518 --> 32:16.853
but practice makes perfect.

32:16.895 --> 32:18.897
(laughing)

32:18.938 --> 32:21.399
Listen, the rest of
the day is yours.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.151
Go relax.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.904
Or better yet,
go have some fun.

32:27.072 --> 32:29.032
Yes.

32:29.074 --> 32:31.076
Maybe I will.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.577
Queen: Come on.

32:34.829 --> 32:36.623
Actually, I would love
a brandy after this.

32:38.917 --> 32:42.796
(fire crackling)

32:42.837 --> 32:52.806
*

32:56.017 --> 32:57.268
Oh, Mr. Jensen.

32:57.310 --> 32:59.562
Prince Henry.

32:59.604 --> 33:02.524
Um, I was wondering
if you've seen Ava around.

33:02.565 --> 33:05.068
Yes, why?
Are you looking for her?

33:05.110 --> 33:07.987
Yes, I am, in fact.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.072
Which is why I'm asking.

33:09.114 --> 33:11.491
Of course.
Yes.

33:11.533 --> 33:14.369
Um, she's tending to
a project in the workshop.

33:14.411 --> 33:17.539
Great. Thank you.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.458
Okay.
Well, she's very busy, though.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.460
She's got a lot
of work to do.

33:23.753 --> 33:33.096
*

33:33.138 --> 33:34.097
Ava?

33:34.139 --> 33:35.140
(gasping)

33:37.475 --> 33:40.311
You really like to
sneak up on people, don't you?

33:40.353 --> 33:42.397
It's not intentional...

33:42.439 --> 33:44.774
I promise.

33:44.816 --> 33:47.485
(clearing throat)
Uh, how can I help you?

33:49.904 --> 33:51.031
I have a proposal.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.825
A proposal?

33:53.867 --> 33:56.786
Look, um, the Winter Castle
is supposed to be a getaway,

33:56.828 --> 33:59.205
but I can hardly turn around
without bumping into someone

33:59.247 --> 34:00.498
who needs something
from me.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.626
So, I was wondering

34:03.668 --> 34:07.339
if you might want to, uh...
take a break.

34:07.380 --> 34:09.924
And get away
for a few hours.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.343
To do what?

34:11.384 --> 34:14.095
To escape all of this

34:14.137 --> 34:16.598
and just have some fun.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.224
I mean, you do
make a good point,

34:18.266 --> 34:21.603
but if Brigitta found out I left
and went somewhere with you

34:21.644 --> 34:23.730
when I'm on this deadline,
she would be--

34:23.772 --> 34:27.650
(imitating accent:)
"Off with her head."

34:27.692 --> 34:31.071
Don't worry
about Brigitta.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.655
(chuckling)

34:32.697 --> 34:35.950
But I have to make these
pooch palaces in the next day.

34:35.992 --> 34:37.660
I can't just leave.

34:37.702 --> 34:39.412
That's what
you're working on.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.830
- Hm.
- Yeah.

34:40.872 --> 34:43.166
Actually, I would love
to get your feedback.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.001
Do you mind taking a look?

34:45.043 --> 34:46.002
No, not at all.

34:46.044 --> 34:47.045
Great.

34:49.297 --> 34:51.132
These are spectacular.

34:51.174 --> 34:52.676
Really?

34:52.717 --> 34:56.930
Yeah. The most impressive
dog houses I have ever seen.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.684
I love the gated archway.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.146
But I have a bit
of news for you.

35:05.188 --> 35:08.358
Um, the, um...

35:08.400 --> 35:12.278
The royal pooches, they are not
coming to the Winter Castle.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.738
But--

35:13.780 --> 35:14.739
What?

35:14.781 --> 35:16.658
But Brigitta said
that they were.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.451
I mean,
I've done all this work.

35:18.493 --> 35:21.663
Yes, um, well,
she suggested it to my mother,

35:21.705 --> 35:26.584
who, well, of course agreed,
but, um, I put an end to it.

35:26.626 --> 35:30.005
I love the dogs,
I know them better than anyone,

35:30.046 --> 35:31.506
They're much happier
back home.

35:31.548 --> 35:33.008
(turkey warbling)

35:33.049 --> 35:36.970
But these
are so spectacular.

35:38.930 --> 35:41.850
I think they should be built
for our primary residence.

35:46.354 --> 35:48.064
But they are
not pressing.

35:48.106 --> 35:50.442
So, just like that,

35:50.483 --> 35:53.236
magic, I cleared
your schedule.

35:53.278 --> 35:55.238
Oh.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.574
Your Highness.

35:57.615 --> 36:00.660
Uh, please.
Call me Henry.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.623
It seems
so informal, though.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.375
I prefer informal.

36:11.379 --> 36:13.089
Okay.

36:13.131 --> 36:14.007
Henry.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.801
Ava.

36:18.470 --> 36:21.723
Well, would you be
so kind

36:21.765 --> 36:23.850
as to accompany me
in an adventure?

36:27.020 --> 36:29.439
Sure.
Okay.

36:29.481 --> 36:31.191
Great. See you soon.

36:43.453 --> 36:46.331
(fire crackling)

36:46.373 --> 36:48.249
Can I ask your
advice on something?

36:48.291 --> 36:49.751
Sure.

36:49.793 --> 36:52.504
Prince Henry asked me
if I wanted to go

36:52.545 --> 36:54.005
on "an adventure" with him.

36:54.047 --> 36:56.466
- He asked you on a date?
- No, it's not a date.

36:56.508 --> 36:57.842
Mm, it sounds like a date.

36:57.884 --> 36:59.260
So, you think
it's a bad idea?

36:59.302 --> 37:01.680
How many girls in
their lifetime get to say

37:01.721 --> 37:03.973
they went on
a date with a prince?

37:04.015 --> 37:05.934
I'm not trying to
complicate things.

37:05.975 --> 37:08.436
I am here to do my job,
help my uncle,

37:08.478 --> 37:11.189
build up my resume.
I don't need to get sidetracked.

37:11.231 --> 37:13.233
I'm sorry. I think
I'm missing something.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.360
I thought we were discussing
going on a date

37:15.402 --> 37:16.820
with Prince Henry.

37:16.861 --> 37:18.988
I have a very
specific life plan,

37:19.030 --> 37:21.574
and it does not involve
getting mixed up with princes.

37:21.616 --> 37:23.118
(laughing)
No offense,

37:23.159 --> 37:24.828
but you're sounding
a little Type A right now.

37:24.869 --> 37:25.829
Type A?

37:25.870 --> 37:27.414
Mm-hm.

37:27.455 --> 37:30.375
But I know there's also
a playful side to you.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.377
I heard about you and
the Prince on the ice slide.

37:32.419 --> 37:35.588
Trust me, people do not
interact with him that way.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.924
I think that's why he wants
to spend more time with you,

37:37.966 --> 37:40.010
and I have no idea why
you wouldn't want

37:40.051 --> 37:42.303
to spend more time
with him.

37:42.345 --> 37:44.347
It's not like I don't
think he's attractive, I do.

37:44.389 --> 37:47.976
He's just-- He just--
got out of a relationship

37:48.018 --> 37:51.146
and, mm, Sigrid has
made it very clear that

37:51.187 --> 37:55.442
she is ready and willing to fill
that void as of immediately.

37:55.483 --> 37:57.193
Look, I know the tabloids
give him a hard time

37:57.235 --> 37:58.737
over his other relationships
and all that,

37:58.778 --> 38:01.698
but I've been around him
quite a bit over the years.

38:01.740 --> 38:05.660
Prince Henry is a gentleman
with a good heart.

38:05.702 --> 38:07.120
He really cares
for people.

38:07.162 --> 38:09.080
It's not just an act.
It's real.

38:10.373 --> 38:11.207
I don't know...

38:11.249 --> 38:12.375
You're over-thinking this.

38:14.919 --> 38:18.840
Maybe. I mean, he did only say
it was gonna be a few hours.

38:18.882 --> 38:20.050
So...

38:21.051 --> 38:22.344
You asked me
for my advice.

38:22.385 --> 38:23.762
So, I'm going
to give it to you.

38:23.803 --> 38:26.181
Go on this date.

38:26.222 --> 38:29.434
I think you'd regret it
one day if you didn't.

38:29.476 --> 38:30.435
Maybe.

38:33.563 --> 38:34.564
Thanks.

38:34.606 --> 38:35.565
Mm-hm.

38:38.568 --> 38:47.577
*

38:47.619 --> 38:49.537
Psst.

38:49.579 --> 38:51.414
Take me away.

38:53.416 --> 38:54.584
Do I know you?

38:54.626 --> 38:57.087
(laughing)

38:57.128 --> 38:58.755
And he's funny too.

38:58.797 --> 39:00.048
(chuckling)

39:00.090 --> 39:02.050
Well, I'm not known
for my humor,

39:02.092 --> 39:04.094
but you seem to
bring it out of me.

39:04.135 --> 39:06.513
I'm sorry,
what is that for?

39:06.554 --> 39:09.724
Oh, in case we run
into a polar bear.

39:09.766 --> 39:11.810
It's just to
scare them off.

39:11.851 --> 39:14.437
You know, one warning shot
just sends them running.

39:14.479 --> 39:17.107
It's to keep us
and the polar bear safe.

39:17.148 --> 39:18.566
I know how much
you love them.

39:18.608 --> 39:20.902
Come on.

39:20.944 --> 39:22.570
You'll be safe with me,
I promise.

39:25.115 --> 39:26.866
I trust you.

39:26.908 --> 39:27.784
Henry:
Good.

39:30.787 --> 39:31.788
(chuckling)

39:38.169 --> 39:39.754
(sighing)
Beautiful.

39:39.796 --> 39:40.797
Mm.

39:42.966 --> 39:45.093
Since your grandfather,
the Duke, died

39:45.135 --> 39:46.678
and we lost all peerages,

39:46.720 --> 39:49.889
I have strived to regain
our family's nobility.

39:49.931 --> 39:54.728
Oh, you must remember, Sigrid,
you are no commoner.

39:54.769 --> 39:58.565
You are as worthy of
becoming princess as anyone.

39:58.606 --> 40:02.152
So, let's make the most
of this dinner tonight.

40:03.153 --> 40:05.280
You have done
your part, Mother,

40:05.321 --> 40:07.907
and now,
I shall do mine.

40:07.949 --> 40:08.908
Mm.

40:10.035 --> 40:11.786
All right.

40:11.828 --> 40:12.829
Wonderful.

40:14.497 --> 40:16.708
Ava: Wow, your country really
is a perfect winter wonderland.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.960
Oh, do you think so?

40:19.002 --> 40:20.253
I love it out here
this time of year.

40:20.295 --> 40:21.546
I can see why.

40:25.508 --> 40:26.718
Oh, what's this?

40:26.760 --> 40:30.305
Some local architecture.
That's a fishing chalet.

40:30.347 --> 40:32.265
I love the design.
Functional.

40:32.307 --> 40:34.309
I feel like we're in
our own private snow globe.

40:34.351 --> 40:35.977
Henry: Hope you're not
getting too cold.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.562
Ava: Nah.

40:37.604 --> 40:43.026
*

40:43.068 --> 40:44.402
Henry:
Oh, look at this. Over here.

40:44.444 --> 40:45.904
Ava:
Oh, they're so cute.

40:45.945 --> 40:55.914
*

40:57.499 --> 40:58.583
Over here.

41:01.378 --> 41:02.629
- Ava: What are they?
- Henry: Reindeer.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.422
Must've heard there was
a special guest in town.

41:04.464 --> 41:05.423
Wow.

41:07.842 --> 41:17.811
*

41:21.940 --> 41:24.025
This setting
is incredible.

41:24.067 --> 41:25.610
Henry: Oh, so you're
not disappointed?

41:25.652 --> 41:28.697
What?
How could I be disappointed?

41:28.738 --> 41:32.617
Well, I thought maybe you were
expecting royal accommodation.

41:32.659 --> 41:35.286
Ava: It's like out of
a fairy tale.

41:35.328 --> 41:36.871
Ah, well,
it's going to get dark soon,

41:36.913 --> 41:40.875
and, um, I have a few
things to set up, so come on.

41:40.917 --> 41:42.585
What?
What things?

41:45.839 --> 41:50.593
(clock ticking)

41:55.765 --> 41:58.351
It's possible he got
the time mixed up.

41:59.853 --> 42:03.064
Possible, though I have
a feeling it's something else.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.274
Oh, dear.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.945
Well, Heaven knows
what's keeping him.

42:10.780 --> 42:12.532
Go to Henry's room

42:12.574 --> 42:14.534
and find out
what's detaining him.

42:17.662 --> 42:19.789
Oh, Sigrid. Tell me,
did you have an opportunity

42:19.831 --> 42:21.291
to explore the grounds?

42:21.332 --> 42:24.336
Um, yes. I did actually,
with the Prince.

42:24.377 --> 42:27.339
Um, it was quite lovely,
lovely property you have.

42:27.380 --> 42:28.465
- Yes.
- Thank you.

42:28.506 --> 42:30.091
It's wonderful out there.

42:30.133 --> 42:31.551
You know, I myself actually

42:31.593 --> 42:33.386
went on a bit of
an exploratory trip.

42:38.933 --> 42:39.976
Prince Henry?

42:42.562 --> 42:44.314
(clearing throat)
Prince Henry?

42:53.656 --> 42:56.076
Okay, call me if
you hear anything.

43:02.916 --> 43:04.876
Mrs. Newton.

43:04.918 --> 43:08.129
Sigrid was wondering if,
after dinner, we could get her

43:08.171 --> 43:10.465
some additional time
with the Prince.

43:10.507 --> 43:14.135
I was thinking
a night cap at our ice bar.

43:14.177 --> 43:15.512
Just the two of them.

43:15.553 --> 43:17.347
I believe if we
give them a little more time

43:17.389 --> 43:19.474
things will run
their natural course.

43:19.516 --> 43:21.643
I don't think that
will be possible.

43:21.685 --> 43:23.311
Why not?

43:23.353 --> 43:26.398
At this hour, it is unlikely
the Prince will turn up.

43:26.439 --> 43:28.983
Well, where is he?

43:29.025 --> 43:31.319
We don't know.

43:31.361 --> 43:33.196
What do you mean
you don't know?

43:33.238 --> 43:35.365
The Prince,
Mrs. Newton, is missing.

43:36.825 --> 43:37.826
Oh.

43:41.830 --> 43:43.498
Ava?

43:43.540 --> 43:45.709
Ava, are you in there?
It's Brigitta.

43:47.335 --> 43:48.545
Ava?

43:51.006 --> 43:53.133
Where are you?

43:53.174 --> 43:54.092
(sighing)

43:57.262 --> 43:58.888
Perhaps more wine.
(clearing throat)

43:58.930 --> 43:59.973
Oh, yes. Please.

44:04.144 --> 44:08.023
Prince Henry is,
um... gone.

44:08.064 --> 44:09.274
Gone?

44:09.315 --> 44:10.942
Gone where?

44:10.984 --> 44:13.486
I've searched all over.
He's nowhere to be found.

44:13.528 --> 44:15.697
I believe he's
left the premises,

44:15.739 --> 44:18.533
possibly with
the American girl, Ava,

44:18.575 --> 44:22.328
as she also seems to
be unaccounted for.

44:22.370 --> 44:23.788
(clearing throat)

44:23.830 --> 44:25.707
Queen:
Well, our son is vulnerable.

44:25.749 --> 44:27.917
I'm afraid he could
easily be manipulated.

44:27.959 --> 44:31.421
I don't know Ava,
but American girls can be

44:31.463 --> 44:33.506
quite cunning when they
see something they want.

44:33.548 --> 44:35.467
Yes, I've heard this
about these American women.

44:35.508 --> 44:37.385
(clearing throat)

44:37.427 --> 44:39.012
Von Trier:
What would you like me to do?

44:39.054 --> 44:41.056
I suggest you find
a little bit more out

44:41.097 --> 44:43.558
about this Ava character.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.852
Try and ascertain
what her motives might be.

44:45.894 --> 44:46.936
Yes, Your Majesties.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.940
Well, I do apologize,
but it seems my son's duties,

44:50.982 --> 44:54.069
of which he has many,
are going to detain him

44:54.110 --> 44:56.821
permanently from dinner,
but I suggest that we eat.

44:56.863 --> 44:57.989
Queen: Yes.

44:58.031 --> 44:59.199
King: Tell the chef
we're ready please.

45:00.283 --> 45:10.460
*

45:17.133 --> 45:19.427
Interesting.

45:19.469 --> 45:22.931
Is that for the firm
you work for in America?

45:22.972 --> 45:24.224
Nope.

45:25.475 --> 45:26.601
It's personal.

45:28.186 --> 45:31.147
These are my mock-ups for
a sustainable housing community.

45:32.857 --> 45:35.068
My country is
becoming less affordable

45:35.110 --> 45:37.028
for lower income families.

45:37.070 --> 45:41.157
So, it's a project
I'm hoping to launch soon.

45:41.199 --> 45:42.575
It's more than
just your country,

45:42.617 --> 45:46.246
but turning crisis
into creation...

45:48.498 --> 45:50.250
I'd like to learn
more about that topic.

45:52.293 --> 45:54.421
Over dinner.
(clearing throat)

45:54.462 --> 45:55.714
May I?

45:58.174 --> 45:59.676
You may.

46:06.057 --> 46:08.309
Wow. Unbelievable.

46:08.351 --> 46:09.602
And flowers, too?

46:09.644 --> 46:11.104
Do you like it?

46:11.146 --> 46:12.605
Yeah.

46:12.647 --> 46:13.982
Come on.
Please, take a seat.

46:15.233 --> 46:16.192
Mm.

46:20.363 --> 46:23.825
Look at this
incredible spread.

46:23.867 --> 46:24.784
Mm.

46:26.202 --> 46:29.622
May I pour you
a glass of wine?

46:29.664 --> 46:31.458
Yes, you may.

46:31.499 --> 46:32.667
Okay.

46:32.709 --> 46:39.215
*

46:39.257 --> 46:40.633
I've got this.

46:40.675 --> 46:42.677
- (laughing)
- No problem.

46:44.554 --> 46:46.473
You don't know how to
open a bottle of wine?

46:46.514 --> 46:48.600
How dare you suggest
something that's...

46:50.268 --> 46:51.686
...absolutely true.
No, I don't.

46:51.728 --> 46:53.605
Here.
You were close.

46:53.646 --> 46:54.773
(clearing throat)
Yeah?

46:54.814 --> 46:56.566
You sort of have--
Yes, you're supposed to

46:56.608 --> 46:58.234
- take off the wrapper first.
- Okay.

46:58.276 --> 47:02.197
Then you twist it
about halfway.

47:02.238 --> 47:03.531
- (popping)
- Oh.

47:03.573 --> 47:05.617
There we are.

47:05.658 --> 47:07.369
Thank you for
coming to the rescue.

47:07.410 --> 47:09.245
(chuckling)

47:09.287 --> 47:12.707
I must admit,
I'm lacking...

47:14.542 --> 47:16.294
...many basic
life skills.

47:16.336 --> 47:18.755
(laughing)

47:18.797 --> 47:21.174
(clearing throat)
Um...

47:21.216 --> 47:24.344
Skál, which means cheers

47:24.386 --> 47:27.722
in Fríorlandic,
Swedish, and Icelandic.

47:27.764 --> 47:28.765
Mm.

47:29.933 --> 47:31.101
Skál.

47:31.142 --> 47:32.102
(glasses clinking)

47:36.773 --> 47:37.732
Mm

47:39.609 --> 47:42.862
So, tell me a little
more about yourself.

47:42.904 --> 47:44.572
What do you want to know?

47:44.614 --> 47:47.367
Yeah, well, let's start with
something easy,

47:47.409 --> 47:50.620
like, uh,
who is Ava Jensen?

47:50.662 --> 47:55.208
Well, I guess, a woman who
loves, loves architecture,

47:55.250 --> 47:58.837
and, I guess,
really wants

47:58.878 --> 48:00.296
to make a difference
in the world.

48:00.338 --> 48:03.383
In what way?

48:03.425 --> 48:05.635
Do something good
for this planet.

48:05.677 --> 48:08.054
Help people.

48:08.096 --> 48:10.932
And, who knows,
maybe that's by creating

48:10.974 --> 48:15.645
this green, sustainable
community housing project.

48:15.687 --> 48:18.606
Ultimately, yes,
I would like to find a partner

48:18.648 --> 48:21.317
and start a family,
but...

48:23.319 --> 48:25.030
(sighing)
...maybe one day.

48:25.071 --> 48:27.991
Those are wonderful
desires to have.

48:32.495 --> 48:34.372
Oh.

48:34.414 --> 48:35.498
Ava:
What is that?

48:35.540 --> 48:37.167
You have to come
outside to see this.

48:37.208 --> 48:38.209
Come on.

48:38.251 --> 48:39.169
What is that?

48:39.210 --> 48:48.345
*

48:48.386 --> 48:50.889
Wow.
It's incredible.

48:52.223 --> 48:55.643
One of Earth's most
magnificent displays.

48:55.685 --> 48:59.272
Our Viking ancestors
believed those lights

48:59.314 --> 49:01.858
were earthly manifestations
of the gods.

49:04.736 --> 49:07.530
What would happen
if I made a wish

49:07.572 --> 49:09.199
under the Northern Lights?

49:12.369 --> 49:13.370
I don't know.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.915
Maybe you should try
and find out.

49:19.042 --> 49:20.043
Okay.

49:22.712 --> 49:25.382
You'll have to tell me
if it comes true.

49:27.008 --> 49:28.802
(shushing)

49:28.843 --> 49:30.053
Only if you're lucky.

49:30.095 --> 49:31.221
Oh.

49:32.555 --> 49:33.723
(chuckling)

49:36.726 --> 49:38.019
You needed to see me?

49:38.061 --> 49:41.022
Please email me
Ava Jensen's file right away.

49:52.075 --> 49:53.410
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

49:53.451 --> 49:55.578
your queen and I would
like to sincerely thank you

49:55.620 --> 49:56.955
for joining us for dinner,

49:56.996 --> 49:59.708
and apologies once more
for our son's...

49:59.749 --> 50:02.043
absent-mindedness.

50:02.085 --> 50:04.921
Surely his responsibilities
overwhelmed him.

50:04.963 --> 50:06.339
Indeed.

50:06.381 --> 50:07.424
Yes.

50:07.465 --> 50:09.384
Thank you for
your understanding.

50:09.426 --> 50:11.302
Of course.

50:11.344 --> 50:12.887
If you'll please excuse me.

50:12.929 --> 50:14.347
Queen:
Yes.

50:14.389 --> 50:15.557
Excuse me.

50:19.310 --> 50:21.187
How did you enjoy dinner,
Ms. Newton?

50:21.229 --> 50:22.605
Have a good evening, Maria.

50:26.443 --> 50:29.821
Thank you for
getting away with me.

50:29.863 --> 50:31.948
It was just
what I needed.

50:31.990 --> 50:34.325
Thank you for inviting me.

50:34.367 --> 50:36.036
I had a really
nice time.

50:36.077 --> 50:37.620
I'd like to see you again,

50:37.662 --> 50:41.249
but, uh, tomorrow I'm gonna be
in hiding for most of the day.

50:41.291 --> 50:43.126
Is everything okay?

50:43.168 --> 50:44.669
Yes, this year
I'm giving the annual

50:44.711 --> 50:46.921
address to the nation.

50:46.963 --> 50:48.965
I, um, haven't finished
my speech yet,

50:49.007 --> 50:52.093
and it's being broadcast in
two days across the country.

50:52.135 --> 50:55.430
Sounds like
a lot of pressure.

50:55.472 --> 50:58.141
Yeah, it is, but it is
an opportunity for us to show

50:58.183 --> 50:59.684
our gratitude for
the previous year

50:59.726 --> 51:03.438
and, uh, to set the tone
for the years to come.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.899
Well, let me know
if you need my help.

51:05.940 --> 51:10.028
I'm just going to find a quiet
place so I can finish it.

51:10.070 --> 51:13.823
I just don't want people to
think I'm reading it, you know?

51:13.865 --> 51:16.576
I want them to know
it's coming from the heart.

51:16.618 --> 51:19.037
I just have to
rehearse quite a bit.

51:19.079 --> 51:23.541
Anyway, sorry, I don't mean to
burden you with all this stuff.

51:23.583 --> 51:27.253
I'm just saying I'm happy
to lend you an ear.

51:27.295 --> 51:28.546
(scoffing)
Are you sure?

51:30.340 --> 51:32.384
After I check
with my uncle

51:32.425 --> 51:34.302
and I make sure
he doesn't need anything,

51:34.344 --> 51:39.057
and as long as Brigitta
doesn't give me 100 more tasks.

51:39.099 --> 51:42.060
Well, you do have royal
immunity from Brigitta.

51:42.102 --> 51:43.853
(laughing)

51:43.895 --> 51:46.147
And, yes,
as long as your uncle

51:46.189 --> 51:48.983
has everything under control,

51:49.025 --> 51:50.819
I'd love it,
if you were with me.

51:50.860 --> 52:00.870
*

52:09.879 --> 52:11.339
(footsteps approaching)

52:11.381 --> 52:14.843
I just received word
the Prince has returned.

52:14.884 --> 52:16.678
This is embarrassing.

52:16.720 --> 52:19.180
I'm not quite sure
how to handle this.

52:19.222 --> 52:23.226
Please inform His Highness
that I am indisposed.

52:23.268 --> 52:25.854
Certainly.
I shall handle it.

52:25.895 --> 52:35.864
*

52:38.700 --> 52:39.743
Your Highness.

52:42.662 --> 52:43.621
Ah, Von Trier.

52:43.663 --> 52:45.707
Where, may I ask,
have you been?

52:45.749 --> 52:48.376
You sound like my parents
when I was a teenager.

52:48.418 --> 52:50.712
Well, it's about
to get worse.

52:50.754 --> 52:53.256
We've been searching all over
God's frozen hectare for you.

52:53.298 --> 52:54.632
You can't just up
and leave

52:54.674 --> 52:56.384
without telling anyone
where you're going.

52:56.426 --> 52:58.219
Okay, I apologize.

52:58.261 --> 52:59.679
And you missed
the dinner.

52:59.721 --> 53:03.058
The king and queen were
beside themselves with worry.

53:03.099 --> 53:05.894
Was it worry
or disappointment?

53:05.935 --> 53:07.604
It was both.

53:07.645 --> 53:09.814
And poor Sigrid,
sitting all alone.

53:09.856 --> 53:11.858
She expected you there.

53:11.900 --> 53:13.443
She was disappointed.

53:13.485 --> 53:14.903
Where did he say he was?

53:14.944 --> 53:15.945
(shushing)

53:15.987 --> 53:19.074
Well, I am sorry
I missed dinner.

53:19.115 --> 53:21.284
It wasn't my intention
to hurt anyone.

53:21.326 --> 53:23.620
Please explain to
Sigrid that something...

53:23.661 --> 53:27.499
(sighing)
...very important came up.

53:27.540 --> 53:29.084
When I do,
shall I include

53:29.125 --> 53:31.044
an invitation to
the Christmas Ball?

53:31.086 --> 53:32.420
(laughing)

53:32.462 --> 53:34.589
- What did he say?
- I don't know, darling. Quiet!

53:34.631 --> 53:36.591
Oh, Von Trier.

53:36.633 --> 53:38.510
I'm beginning to see
why marriage has eluded you.

53:38.551 --> 53:41.471
Just lighten up
a little bit.

53:41.513 --> 53:44.432
Hm?
It would do you some good.

53:44.474 --> 53:46.351
I'm off to
the Winter Castle.

53:46.393 --> 53:48.520
- Is it the American girl?
- I don't know.

53:48.561 --> 53:50.271
- She's so unrefined, Mother.
- I know.

53:50.313 --> 53:51.898
And I spent all that
time on my posture

53:51.940 --> 53:53.316
and my etiquette lessons.

53:54.484 --> 53:56.820
- What was that?
- What was what?

53:58.321 --> 54:00.407
Oh, they see us.
Let's go.

54:00.448 --> 54:03.743
(Heels clacking)

54:03.785 --> 54:06.746
Prince, wait, you never
told me where you were.

54:06.788 --> 54:07.956
Goodnight,
Deputy Von Trier.

54:11.876 --> 54:21.845
*

54:41.656 --> 54:43.533
The request didn't
come from Brigitta, did it?

54:43.575 --> 54:45.035
No, why?

54:45.076 --> 54:47.662
I think the reason she gave
you the dog house assignment

54:47.704 --> 54:51.291
in the first place
was to keep you occupied

54:51.332 --> 54:53.001
and away from the Prince.

54:53.043 --> 54:54.961
Well, that sure backfired.

54:55.003 --> 54:56.338
How do you mean?

54:56.379 --> 54:59.007
Mm, it doesn't matter.

54:59.049 --> 55:01.259
I just wanted to make
sure it's okay with you,

55:01.301 --> 55:03.011
that you don't need me
before I commit.

55:03.053 --> 55:05.847
Well, if the Royal Family
requested your services

55:05.889 --> 55:09.684
and it's within reason,
then by all means commit.

55:09.726 --> 55:12.520
You know, I think for
the first time since we started

55:12.562 --> 55:15.690
the Winter Castle, I feel
like everything's in order.

55:15.732 --> 55:18.026
Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear it.

55:18.068 --> 55:20.028
So, what did they request?

55:20.070 --> 55:23.782
It wasn't as much of a request
as I offered to help.

55:23.823 --> 55:26.993
Oh, to do what
and for whom?

55:27.035 --> 55:29.412
Prince Henry
with his speech.

55:31.081 --> 55:32.999
Oh.

55:33.041 --> 55:34.334
Mm-hm.

55:34.376 --> 55:36.294
He said he wanted to go
somewhere private,

55:36.336 --> 55:37.879
just the two of us.

55:37.921 --> 55:40.256
Just the two of you.

55:40.298 --> 55:42.759
Doesn't that seem
a little intimate?

55:42.801 --> 55:45.887
Uncle Karl,
I'm a professional.

55:45.929 --> 55:47.347
Okay, I believe you.

55:47.389 --> 55:50.600
It's what other people will
believe that concerns me.

55:50.642 --> 55:52.644
I think the Prince is
just comfortable around me

55:52.686 --> 55:54.437
because I'm not
in his royal circle.

55:54.479 --> 55:57.649
I know, and I know
you're a professional.

55:57.691 --> 56:00.443
I am wary of you
getting too close.

56:00.485 --> 56:01.820
I would hate to
see you get hurt.

56:03.738 --> 56:06.366
Uncle Karl, you know
what I've been through.

56:06.408 --> 56:09.244
If I can get through that,
then trust me,

56:09.285 --> 56:10.704
I can make it
through anything.

56:16.668 --> 56:19.879
Uh, the general idea of
the message I want to convey,

56:19.921 --> 56:21.965
I just can't seem
to get it across.

56:24.300 --> 56:27.012
Why don't you tell me
about these sketches

56:27.053 --> 56:29.014
I keep seeing you make?

56:29.055 --> 56:31.891
No, no. This is
not why we're here.

56:31.933 --> 56:34.561
Oh, but I need
a break, okay?

56:36.855 --> 56:39.149
So, please.
Show me.

56:40.275 --> 56:43.862
I guess the theme
of it is, um,

56:43.903 --> 56:46.031
the unpredictability
of life.

56:46.072 --> 56:49.534
I mean, sometimes you think
you have everything you need,

56:49.576 --> 56:51.411
and then all of a sudden
your life just gets flipped

56:51.453 --> 56:52.787
turned upside down.

56:52.829 --> 56:57.125
These sketches are shelters
or dwellings that can be

56:57.167 --> 57:02.047
built quickly and inexpensively
after natural disasters.

57:02.088 --> 57:05.216
To keep the costs down we would
use discarded materials

57:05.258 --> 57:08.928
such as recycled corking
for the floor,

57:08.970 --> 57:11.389
pressing newspapers
into wood,

57:11.431 --> 57:13.433
and shipping containers that
can be turned into dwellings.

57:13.475 --> 57:14.809
Things like that.

57:14.851 --> 57:17.354
Interesting, that's--
that's amazing.

57:17.395 --> 57:21.066
Mm-hm. It's not only designed to
put a roof over someone's head,

57:21.107 --> 57:24.110
but they also
provide comfort.

57:24.152 --> 57:28.198
The architect Shigeru Ban,
he has been building structures

57:28.239 --> 57:30.784
like this in places that
have been hit by hurricanes

57:30.825 --> 57:32.035
and earthquakes.

57:32.077 --> 57:34.788
I'm familiar with
some of his work.

57:34.829 --> 57:36.331
Yeah, he's brilliant.

57:36.373 --> 57:40.502
I mean, I've basically just
taken his idea and expanded it.

57:40.543 --> 57:42.754
This is extraordinary, Ava.

57:42.796 --> 57:43.922
Thank you.

57:43.963 --> 57:47.133
And it just gave me
an idea.

57:48.259 --> 57:49.135
Really?

57:49.177 --> 57:50.553
Yes, yes, yes.
This is good.

57:52.472 --> 57:54.099
(sighing)
Yeah.

57:54.140 --> 57:56.559
No, you've inspired a bit of
a breakthrough.

57:56.601 --> 58:06.569
*

58:42.105 --> 58:46.109
Care and one of the finest
public education systems

58:46.151 --> 58:47.527
in the world.

58:47.569 --> 58:49.612
Due to various--

58:49.654 --> 58:50.864
Global.

58:50.905 --> 58:53.033
Various global
circumstances.

58:54.743 --> 58:56.536
What's wrong?

58:56.578 --> 58:58.413
I just--

58:58.455 --> 59:00.999
I've never been
comfortable giving speeches.

59:01.041 --> 59:03.668
I just get really nervous
and the back of my neck

59:03.710 --> 59:04.753
and my shoulders cramp up.

59:04.794 --> 59:06.296
Well, you shouldn't
be so stressed

59:06.338 --> 59:07.839
because you're actually
a very good speaker.

59:07.881 --> 59:10.050
I appreciate that.

59:12.177 --> 59:15.221
You know, I think I may
have seen a hot tub earlier.

59:15.263 --> 59:16.598
Oh, yes.

59:16.639 --> 59:18.433
Us Fríorlanders take our hot
tubbing quite seriously.

59:20.852 --> 59:23.730
Are you suggesting
we go for a soak?

59:23.772 --> 59:25.357
I think it'll be good
for you to take a hot tub.

59:25.398 --> 59:27.901
It'll relax you,
be good for your muscles.

59:27.942 --> 59:29.194
I think you're right.

59:29.235 --> 59:30.653
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

59:30.695 --> 59:31.654
Sounds great.

59:31.696 --> 59:32.864
Yeah? Does it?

59:32.906 --> 59:34.032
Yes.

59:34.074 --> 59:36.034
Henry: Mm.

59:36.076 --> 59:39.037
This water
feels amazing.

59:39.079 --> 59:40.955
This was a good call.

59:40.997 --> 59:42.123
I think so.

59:45.085 --> 59:46.503
You know, if you were here
any longer

59:46.544 --> 59:49.297
I'd take you up north
to the thermal lagoons.

59:49.339 --> 59:52.133
Who knows?
Maybe I'll come back.

59:52.175 --> 59:55.387
I'm really starting to take
a liking to your country.

59:55.428 --> 59:56.388
Really?

59:56.429 --> 59:57.305
Mm-hm.

59:57.347 --> 59:58.556
Well, then
it's settled then.

59:58.598 --> 59:59.891
You must return.

59:59.933 --> 01:00:01.643
(chuckling)

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:03.937
I have so much more
I want to show you.

01:00:03.978 --> 01:00:05.271
Mind you, our country's
about the same size

01:00:05.313 --> 01:00:06.898
as the state of Vermont,

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.276
so it wouldn't take
long to see it all.

01:00:10.318 --> 01:00:13.196
A tour of Fríorland
by the Prince himself?

01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:14.989
Who would pass that up?

01:00:15.031 --> 01:00:16.616
Well, it would not
be wise to do so.

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:18.702
No, it wouldn't.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.246
(both laughing)

01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:25.709
You feel good,
not as stiff?

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.252
- I feel fantastic.
- Good.

01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:28.753
Thank you for
that suggestion.

01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:30.088
(camera clicking)

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.090
Oh, um, please.
Just ignore him, okay?

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:34.175
Ava: I thought this
place was private?

01:00:34.217 --> 01:00:36.261
It was. Someone must have
tipped him off, I guess.

01:00:36.302 --> 01:00:38.304
Prince Henry!
Is this your new girlfriend?

01:00:38.346 --> 01:00:41.558
Please, respect our privacy.
We're just friends.

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:43.101
Can you just give me
her name for the caption?

01:00:43.143 --> 01:00:44.978
You're not
permitted to be here.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.355
So, I suggest you leave.

01:00:47.397 --> 01:00:49.441
If I see you again I'll have
you escorted off the premises.

01:00:49.482 --> 01:00:51.484
I'm sorry. I'm only trying
to support my family.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:58.116
*

01:00:58.158 --> 01:00:59.826
Ava:
Unbelievable.

01:00:59.868 --> 01:01:01.619
I'm really,
really sorry.

01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:03.955
What do you think they're
going to do with those photos?

01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:06.791
Sell them to
the highest bidder I assume,

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:10.920
and then come up with some story
to go along with the photos.

01:01:10.962 --> 01:01:13.548
I knew
it wasn't smart,

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:15.216
us spending
so much time together.

01:01:15.258 --> 01:01:17.344
You're right.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.597
I am sorry.

01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:23.725
But I did really enjoy
our time together.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:24.768
I did, too.

01:01:26.728 --> 01:01:28.396
I'm going to go spend
some time with my uncle

01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:31.149
and, you know,
just lay low for a bit.

01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:34.319
Yes, I think
that's a good idea.

01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:36.863
But your speech, it's,
um, it's in great shape.

01:01:36.905 --> 01:01:38.823
You should be proud
of yourself.

01:01:38.865 --> 01:01:40.992
Well, thanks to you, yes.

01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:43.703
I don't know about that.

01:01:43.745 --> 01:01:45.246
Oh.

01:01:45.288 --> 01:01:46.456
Listen, um...

01:01:46.498 --> 01:01:48.541
Tomorrow's going to
be rather crazy.

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:52.295
I've got obligations
before then after the address.

01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:56.341
But I was
wondering if, um,

01:01:56.383 --> 01:01:58.051
you have any plans
on Christmas Eve.

01:01:58.093 --> 01:02:01.096
I'm supposed
to go into town

01:02:01.137 --> 01:02:03.014
and have brunch
with my uncle,

01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:05.266
but after that, nope.
I'm free.

01:02:05.308 --> 01:02:06.434
- No plans.
- Good.

01:02:06.476 --> 01:02:09.062
Could you possibly
keep the evening open?

01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:13.692
Yes, for you
I suppose I could.

01:02:13.733 --> 01:02:14.984
Excellent.

01:02:15.026 --> 01:02:17.904
'Cause I have, um,
a little something in mind.

01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:28.248
*

01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:39.509
It appears you've come
upon something of interest.

01:02:39.551 --> 01:02:41.678
I'm afraid so.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.305
Don't leave a lady in suspense.
What is it?

01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:49.811
Oh, dear me.

01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:55.025
(turkeys warbling)

01:02:55.066 --> 01:02:57.569
I don't think you understand
what you're turning down.

01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:01.406
This is tabloid gold.
They will pay a fortune for it.

01:03:01.448 --> 01:03:03.074
Simply submit it
along with your photograph.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:06.369
Ma'am, I appreciate what
you're trying to do for me,

01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:07.662
but I only sell photographs.

01:03:07.704 --> 01:03:09.122
I'm not trying to
ruin anybody's life.

01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:10.790
Besides, I like the Prince,

01:03:10.832 --> 01:03:12.292
and when I see him
together with that woman

01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:14.002
they seem genuinely happy.

01:03:14.044 --> 01:03:16.546
I am not trying to
ruin anyone's life either.

01:03:16.588 --> 01:03:20.091
I am trying to
protect the Prince.

01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:22.635
Fine, I will give it
to someone else then,

01:03:22.677 --> 01:03:24.387
and you'll be sorry
you passed when you see it

01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:26.056
on the front page tomorrow.

01:03:26.097 --> 01:03:29.726
They pay a lot more for scoops
than they do for pictures.

01:03:31.644 --> 01:03:33.104
Henry: ...foundation of what
has become

01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:36.232
the strongest regional
collaborations in the world.

01:03:36.274 --> 01:03:37.692
This unity--

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:40.945
Prince Henry, if I may
have a moment of your time.

01:03:40.987 --> 01:03:42.113
Can it wait?

01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.573
I'm sorry,
but something has come to light

01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:46.242
that needs to be
brought to your attention.

01:03:46.284 --> 01:03:48.078
(sighing)
What is it?

01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:49.245
It's about Ava.

01:03:50.622 --> 01:03:52.582
I'm listening.

01:03:52.624 --> 01:03:55.210
Ava was engaged
to be married.

01:03:58.963 --> 01:04:00.507
How long ago?

01:04:00.548 --> 01:04:03.593
It's been almost three years,
but the man she was engaged to,

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:04.886
he is in prison.

01:04:09.265 --> 01:04:10.433
For what?

01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:12.727
Security fraud,
perjury, money laundering.

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:15.021
He stole millions
from investors.

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:20.860
Well...

01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:23.655
I'm sure Ava had
nothing to do with it.

01:04:23.697 --> 01:04:25.198
Otherwise, she would
have been charged.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.493
We are still looking into that,
but, innocent or not,

01:04:28.535 --> 01:04:30.995
Ava was closely
associated with a man

01:04:31.037 --> 01:04:32.455
who turned out
to be a criminal.

01:04:32.497 --> 01:04:34.249
We need to hear
her side of the story.

01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:38.294
Do my parents know?

01:04:38.336 --> 01:04:40.046
Not yet.

01:04:40.088 --> 01:04:43.174
Okay, don't tell them
anything until we know more,

01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:44.843
and don't let any of
this leak to the press.

01:04:46.511 --> 01:04:49.305
(scoffing)

01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:50.682
It already has,
hasn't it?

01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:52.809
I can't say for certain,
but if it has

01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:54.477
and they run the story,

01:04:54.519 --> 01:04:57.272
your reputation
will be tarnished,

01:04:57.313 --> 01:04:59.315
but I have a plan to quickly
return you to the good graces

01:04:59.357 --> 01:05:02.694
of the royal council
and the people of Fríorland.

01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:06.197
My reputation isn't
what's important here.

01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:10.535
All I care about
is Ava.

01:05:10.577 --> 01:05:12.287
And I want to
tell you something.

01:05:13.788 --> 01:05:17.042
These games you all
play to manipulate me

01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:20.587
and make me do things
that others think is best,

01:05:20.628 --> 01:05:24.966
they might have just ruined
my chance with the first woman

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:27.177
I've had real feelings
for in a long time.

01:05:29.512 --> 01:05:31.848
Prince Henry,
they're ready for you.

01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:37.187
(clearing throat)

01:05:39.439 --> 01:05:40.440
King:
Good luck.

01:05:40.482 --> 01:05:41.858
You got this.

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:47.072
(clearing throat)

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:52.786
We are going
live in five, four,

01:05:52.827 --> 01:05:56.748
three, two, one.
Shooting.

01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:00.877
Greetings, fellow Fríorlanders,
our Nordic neighbors,

01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:03.213
and friends tuning in
from all over the world.

01:06:03.254 --> 01:06:05.882
I want to thank you
for joining us for

01:06:05.924 --> 01:06:09.135
our annual
Christmas address.

01:06:09.177 --> 01:06:11.596
I would like to open by
expressing our gratitude

01:06:11.638 --> 01:06:14.849
to all Fríorlanders,
who, year after year,

01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:17.852
work tirelessly
to make our small,

01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:20.772
but proud nation,
a major player

01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:22.023
on the global stage.

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:24.734
I would also like to
express our gratitude

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:27.862
for the continued cooperation
and goodwill

01:06:27.904 --> 01:06:29.406
between all Nordic nations.

01:06:29.447 --> 01:06:32.909
This provides the foundation
of what has become

01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:36.371
one of the strongest regional
collaborations in all the world.

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:39.290
The unity we maintain
is the cornerstone

01:06:39.332 --> 01:06:41.001
of our economic success.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:45.213
While we enjoy much good
fortune this Christmas season,

01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:48.425
let us not forget
people are suffering.

01:06:48.466 --> 01:06:51.761
So, let us use this
occasion to open our hearts

01:06:51.803 --> 01:06:54.347
to those in need
and take an honest look

01:06:54.389 --> 01:06:56.016
at what we can
do better,

01:06:56.057 --> 01:06:58.226
and how we can
help more.

01:06:58.268 --> 01:07:00.854
Why are we here,

01:07:00.895 --> 01:07:03.398
if not to live in
the service of others?

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.235
Fríorland has been
a safe haven of neutrality,

01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:10.447
in which larger nations
have bartered for peace.

01:07:10.488 --> 01:07:12.282
What better time
than Christmas

01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:16.286
is there to remind us all
for the need for peace?

01:07:16.327 --> 01:07:19.956
So, as we move
through this coming year,

01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:23.543
it is my hope that
our thoughts and actions

01:07:23.585 --> 01:07:26.796
can be led by mercy
and compassion.

01:07:26.838 --> 01:07:30.300
Because,
if enough of us can do that,

01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:33.845
we have a chance of changing
the world for the better.

01:07:33.887 --> 01:07:37.223
Merry Christmas
to all,

01:07:37.265 --> 01:07:38.183
and God bless.

01:07:39.517 --> 01:07:41.311
Wonderful.

01:07:44.064 --> 01:07:45.857
Good job, son.
Well done.

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:51.654
*

01:07:51.696 --> 01:07:54.324
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

01:07:54.366 --> 01:07:56.201
Prince Henry, the King
of Sweden is on the phone

01:07:56.242 --> 01:07:57.994
and has requested
a word with you.

01:07:58.036 --> 01:07:59.829
He was very moved
by your speech.

01:07:59.871 --> 01:08:01.664
I need to see
Ava right now.

01:08:01.706 --> 01:08:03.124
There's no time for that.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:05.377
Your Highness,
the King of Sweden.

01:08:05.418 --> 01:08:07.253
Please, we do not want
to keep him waiting.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.757
Following the call,
the press junket will begin.

01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.050
Afterwards there will
be a debriefing

01:08:12.092 --> 01:08:13.218
with the royal council.

01:08:14.636 --> 01:08:15.553
(groaning)

01:08:17.681 --> 01:08:18.556
Prince Henry here.

01:08:20.392 --> 01:08:21.851
Well, the Prince
really delivered today.

01:08:21.893 --> 01:08:23.061
What a speech.

01:08:23.103 --> 01:08:26.106
Yeah, I'm proud of him.

01:08:26.147 --> 01:08:29.734
It's been a real gift,
spending this holiday together.

01:08:29.776 --> 01:08:31.403
Like old times.

01:08:31.444 --> 01:08:32.987
Yeah.

01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:34.739
Get some sleep.

01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:35.990
You too.

01:08:36.032 --> 01:08:37.158
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.159
G'night.

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:42.122
Thank you, sir.

01:08:42.163 --> 01:08:43.331
And merry Christmas to you
and your family.

01:08:43.373 --> 01:08:44.708
King of Sweden:
Thank you, Prince Henry.

01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:46.543
Wonderful address tonight.
Congratulations.

01:08:46.584 --> 01:08:48.044
(phone pinging)

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.970
*

01:09:01.891 --> 01:09:11.860
*

01:09:13.903 --> 01:09:23.872
*

01:09:28.835 --> 01:09:38.845
*

01:09:49.147 --> 01:09:50.315
(sighing)

01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:54.819
*

01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:55.779
(scoffing)

01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:02.452
Your Highness.

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:04.954
Just the person
we were looking for.

01:10:04.996 --> 01:10:05.997
Have you seen Ava?

01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:07.457
Uh, she's not here.

01:10:07.499 --> 01:10:08.249
What?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.584
Well, she's gone.

01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:10.669
Gone?

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:12.671
When I spoke with
her earlier today,

01:10:12.712 --> 01:10:15.340
we both agreed that since
her business is concluded here,

01:10:15.382 --> 01:10:17.384
she should depart
immediately.

01:10:17.425 --> 01:10:19.010
You've got to be kidding.

01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:20.637
Now that her
dirty laundry

01:10:20.679 --> 01:10:22.681
has been aired all
over the front page,

01:10:22.722 --> 01:10:26.226
she's hardly fit to associate
with the Royal Family.

01:10:26.267 --> 01:10:28.186
She has been informed that any
further communication

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:30.188
with you
is strictly forbidden.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:32.941
Great, that's why
she's not answering my calls.

01:10:32.982 --> 01:10:34.234
Where is she right now?

01:10:34.275 --> 01:10:36.653
Well, I believe she's on
her way to the airport.

01:10:36.695 --> 01:10:38.530
(scoffing)
I can't believe this.

01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:42.075
I assure you,
this is in your best interest.

01:10:42.117 --> 01:10:43.493
I wish people would
stop thinking they know

01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:45.245
what's in
my best interests.

01:10:45.286 --> 01:10:46.579
I have to find her.

01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:49.749
But what about
the Ball?!

01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:56.840
I-- I cannot stand the way
the tabloids twist the truth.

01:10:56.881 --> 01:10:59.259
Eh, it's all my fault.

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.469
I should have kept
my distance.

01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:04.931
I just hope it doesn't
reflect poorly on you.

01:11:06.599 --> 01:11:10.395
Ava, I would not have been able
to pull this off without you,

01:11:10.437 --> 01:11:14.566
but now I just wish
I'd never gotten you involved.

01:11:14.607 --> 01:11:16.401
I just thought

01:11:16.443 --> 01:11:19.779
it would be a wonderful
experience for you.

01:11:19.821 --> 01:11:21.614
It was.

01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:23.074
I got to spend
time with you.

01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:26.578
Help you build
your spectacular creation.

01:11:26.619 --> 01:11:27.662
(chuckling)

01:11:27.704 --> 01:11:31.041
Honestly.
I don't have any regrets.

01:11:31.082 --> 01:11:33.626
You've always been
a ray of sunshine.

01:11:33.668 --> 01:11:36.171
Ever since you were
a little girl,

01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:38.214
in your castle
in the backyard.

01:11:38.256 --> 01:11:39.966
I--

01:11:40.008 --> 01:11:43.595
I want you to know how much
it has always meant to me

01:11:43.636 --> 01:11:45.180
to be a part
of your life.

01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:47.807
Uncle Karl.
Mm.

01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:50.810
You've always been
an inspiration to me.

01:11:50.852 --> 01:11:51.853
(chuckling)

01:11:51.895 --> 01:11:53.605
Okay.
(clearing throat)

01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:56.858
I have to go.
Don't want to miss my flight.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:59.527
Don't want to be another
international incident.

01:11:59.569 --> 01:12:00.695
Love you, sweetheart.

01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:02.280
I love you, too.

01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:04.074
Thank you
for the polar bear.

01:12:04.115 --> 01:12:05.116
Karl:
Of course.

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:12.457
*

01:12:12.499 --> 01:12:13.958
Did you get a copy
of the court ruling?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.001
Von Trier: I did.

01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:16.252
And?

01:12:16.294 --> 01:12:18.755
Von Trier:
Uh, well, it turns out that

01:12:18.797 --> 01:12:20.340
it exonerates Ava
of any wrongdoing.

01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:22.550
She was completely
deceived by her fiancé,

01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:25.929
and was as shocked as anyone
to learn what he was up to.

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:27.514
I knew she was innocent.

01:12:27.555 --> 01:12:30.600
Your Highness, I just want to
say I'm so sorry that this got--

01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:33.687
Your Highness?

01:12:38.858 --> 01:12:42.737
(phone ringing)

01:12:44.155 --> 01:12:49.661
*

01:12:49.703 --> 01:12:52.622
No, I'm still a half hour away
and Ava won't return my calls.

01:12:54.332 --> 01:12:55.625
Then hold the plane.

01:12:57.252 --> 01:12:59.337
Why can't you?

01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:01.840
I guess you'll just
have to detain her then.

01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:08.013
I know it sounds harsh,
but do it politely, can't you?

01:13:08.054 --> 01:13:18.064
*

01:13:19.733 --> 01:13:20.734
Hello.

01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:23.486
Hello?

01:13:26.781 --> 01:13:29.534
Hello?
I'm going to miss my flight.

01:13:31.202 --> 01:13:33.204
I'm going to miss--

01:13:33.246 --> 01:13:34.706
(sighing)

01:13:34.748 --> 01:13:36.041
What are you
doing here?

01:13:36.082 --> 01:13:38.585
I needed to see you.

01:13:38.626 --> 01:13:41.379
Oh, so it was you
who had me escorted here

01:13:41.421 --> 01:13:43.548
and is keeping
me captive.

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:46.217
You're not being
kept captive.

01:13:46.259 --> 01:13:48.053
It sure feels
like I am.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.639
You know
that article they ran?

01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:54.267
It made it seem like I came
here to swindle your family.

01:13:54.309 --> 01:13:56.978
I know,
that's what the tabloids do.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:02.025
They sensationalize,
sometimes even flat-out lie.

01:14:02.067 --> 01:14:05.570
Make people look
like frauds.

01:14:05.612 --> 01:14:08.156
I was with my fiancé
for two years.

01:14:08.198 --> 01:14:11.159
He's the one who devastated
those people's lives.

01:14:11.201 --> 01:14:14.120
All I've done is try
and just move on

01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:15.205
from the pain
that he's caused.

01:14:17.957 --> 01:14:20.251
It's like no matter
how hard I try,

01:14:20.293 --> 01:14:21.795
it's the past that's
always haunting me.

01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:27.801
Ava, I admire you more knowing
what you've been through.

01:14:30.136 --> 01:14:32.972
No one has ever made me
feel the way that you have.

01:14:35.517 --> 01:14:36.726
It's true.

01:14:39.187 --> 01:14:40.188
Things just feel...

01:14:41.898 --> 01:14:44.859
...better and brighter
with you around.

01:14:47.404 --> 01:14:50.031
I don't want you
to go.

01:14:50.073 --> 01:14:51.116
Tomorrow's Christmas.

01:14:53.451 --> 01:14:57.038
And I'd be honored
if you accompany me

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.623
to the Christmas Ball.

01:14:58.665 --> 01:15:00.750
Like, as your date?

01:15:04.254 --> 01:15:07.090
No, no.

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:11.011
It's been made clear
I'm not welcome here.

01:15:11.052 --> 01:15:12.470
No, that is not true.

01:15:12.512 --> 01:15:14.848
Yeah, it is.

01:15:17.392 --> 01:15:18.435
I have to go.

01:15:18.476 --> 01:15:19.811
Merry Christmas.

01:15:19.853 --> 01:15:21.646
Ava. Ava!

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:41.791
*

01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:53.386
*

01:16:07.233 --> 01:16:16.201
*

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:21.289
(people chatting)

01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:28.880
What is it?

01:16:31.591 --> 01:16:40.809
*

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:45.647
I got confirmation
that you landed safely.

01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:49.109
It's true.
I landed safely in Fríorland.

01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:52.821
Sorry, I just left out a little
bit of information for you.

01:16:52.862 --> 01:16:56.324
(stammers)
I'm confused.

01:16:56.366 --> 01:16:59.828
Well, it only took me until
I was 30,000 feet in the air

01:16:59.869 --> 01:17:02.247
to realize that
I made a mistake.

01:17:02.288 --> 01:17:05.625
Luckily, the pilots were kind
enough to turn back around.

01:17:07.419 --> 01:17:09.254
Why didn't you
tell me you came back?

01:17:11.172 --> 01:17:12.173
Surprise.

01:17:12.215 --> 01:17:13.591
(chuckling)

01:17:13.633 --> 01:17:16.302
Deputy Von Trier was notified
that Ava had returned,

01:17:16.344 --> 01:17:20.849
and because he was riddled with
guilt over the tabloid story,

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:24.519
he jumped at the chance
to reunite the two of you

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:26.104
in the most meaningful way.

01:17:26.146 --> 01:17:28.898
Von Trier,
get over here.

01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:31.860
You arranged this?

01:17:31.901 --> 01:17:33.194
I did, Your Highness.

01:17:33.236 --> 01:17:35.030
And now that the two
of you are together,

01:17:35.071 --> 01:17:37.824
I must apologize from
the bottom of my heart.

01:17:37.866 --> 01:17:40.035
I hope
you can forgive me,

01:17:40.076 --> 01:17:43.204
though I know
I do not deserve it.

01:17:43.246 --> 01:17:46.833
And Ms. Jensen,
if it takes until my dying day,

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:48.585
I shall make it up
to you.

01:17:53.506 --> 01:17:55.425
How'd you get
the dress?

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:56.426
Brigitta.

01:17:57.594 --> 01:17:58.887
Brigitta?

01:17:58.928 --> 01:18:01.181
Your Highness.

01:18:01.222 --> 01:18:03.892
When I learned
the truth about Ava

01:18:03.933 --> 01:18:06.603
and I saw how upset
you were when she left,

01:18:06.644 --> 01:18:09.230
I knew I had to
help reunite you.

01:18:09.272 --> 01:18:11.191
I apologize.

01:18:11.232 --> 01:18:13.443
I was wr--

01:18:13.485 --> 01:18:16.863
What she's trying to
say is she was wrong.

01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:18.365
- Exactly.
- We both were.

01:18:18.406 --> 01:18:19.574
Yes.

01:18:20.867 --> 01:18:24.245
Well, we still need
to talk about this,

01:18:24.287 --> 01:18:28.458
but I can't tell you
how thrilled I am...

01:18:30.126 --> 01:18:32.128
...about this
wonderful surprise.

01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:35.799
Thank you all.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.761
*

01:18:39.803 --> 01:18:40.720
(chuckling)

01:18:42.555 --> 01:18:45.809
May I have this dance?

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:47.352
You may.

01:18:50.522 --> 01:18:57.529
*

01:18:57.570 --> 01:19:00.448
I wonder what the tabloids
will have to say about us now.

01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:02.409
Henry:
Oh, yes.

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:06.287
Hm, well,
heaven only knows, right?

01:19:06.329 --> 01:19:07.580
(both chuckling)

01:19:07.622 --> 01:19:08.707
I'm not going to lie,

01:19:08.748 --> 01:19:11.126
I saw the photo
that they ran of us,

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:13.503
and we look
kind of cute together.

01:19:13.545 --> 01:19:15.714
We do, don't we?

01:19:15.755 --> 01:19:16.673
Mm-hm.

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:21.386
Actually, you just
gave me an idea.

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:23.013
Come on.

01:19:25.265 --> 01:19:27.058
Excuse me.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.436
Thank you
for coming tonight,

01:19:29.477 --> 01:19:32.313
and I want you to
take a picture of us.

01:19:32.355 --> 01:19:33.148
Excuse me?

01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:34.774
If you don't mind.

01:19:34.816 --> 01:19:37.986
Ms. Jensen and I
would like an official

01:19:38.028 --> 01:19:39.362
Christmas Ball photograph.

01:19:39.404 --> 01:19:41.531
Uh, yeah. Okay.
Uh, let me just...

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:44.951
Hold those smiles.

01:19:44.993 --> 01:19:45.994
(camera clicking)

01:19:46.036 --> 01:19:47.579
Hold that pose.
One more.

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.622
Just one more.

01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:53.209
*

01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:54.085
Got it.

01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:56.004
Henry: Thank you.

01:19:56.046 --> 01:19:57.172
I hope you can still
make it home

01:19:57.213 --> 01:19:58.590
to your family for Christmas.

01:19:58.631 --> 01:20:00.300
Thank you,
Your Highness.

01:20:01.843 --> 01:20:03.636
I'm going to call my wife
and tell her I'll be home

01:20:03.678 --> 01:20:05.013
for Christmas dinner.

01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:06.598
- Thank you, merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:20:06.639 --> 01:20:08.141
- Ava: Nice meeting you.
- Paparazzo: Thank you.

01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:12.187
Oh, wow.
Would you look at that.

01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:15.357
Oh, I think
that's so sweet.

01:20:15.398 --> 01:20:18.318
They're really
good people deep down.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.780
They just needed
a little love in their life.

01:20:21.821 --> 01:20:23.239
Hm, yes,
maybe you're right.

01:20:25.325 --> 01:20:27.952
You know, after my address,

01:20:27.994 --> 01:20:30.372
I spoke to my parents
and the Royal Council,

01:20:30.413 --> 01:20:32.332
and they were in agreement
that we need to expand

01:20:32.374 --> 01:20:36.544
our humanitarian
relief efforts,

01:20:36.586 --> 01:20:40.423
including an international
sustainable green community

01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:43.885
housing project
called Polar Green.

01:20:43.927 --> 01:20:47.389
Henry!
That's amazing.

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.600
Thing is, um, we'll need
someone to head it up.

01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:53.561
You're serious?

01:20:53.603 --> 01:20:55.563
Very.

01:20:55.605 --> 01:20:59.109
That would require me
relocating here.

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:02.612
Yes, yes.
Yes, it would.

01:21:02.654 --> 01:21:06.241
I would like nothing more.

01:21:06.282 --> 01:21:09.744
And I mean that
with all my heart.

01:21:11.329 --> 01:21:14.124
Do you remember when we were
under the Northern Lights

01:21:14.165 --> 01:21:16.584
and I promised you that
I would tell you my wish

01:21:16.626 --> 01:21:18.670
if it came true?

01:21:18.712 --> 01:21:19.629
Yes.

01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:29.639
*

01:21:31.808 --> 01:21:32.809
It just did.

01:21:34.519 --> 01:21:44.487
*

01:21:55.832 --> 01:22:05.842
*
