00:06.465 --> 00:09.301
"In Mexico,
data show that 53% of women

00:09.385 --> 00:11.387
cheat on their partners,

00:11.512 --> 00:14.265
as opposed to 47% of men."

00:55.514 --> 00:56.640
Óscar?

00:58.017 --> 00:59.018
Óscar!

01:02.813 --> 01:05.775
No, please. Stop it, please.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.694
- I've had enough.
- I'm here to make amends.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.239
Your coffee.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.828
You're not pissed anymore?

01:19.622 --> 01:21.290
Didn't you poison my coffee?

01:22.708 --> 01:23.667
I didn't.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.754
I messed up.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.632
I don't know how to put it, but...

01:31.300 --> 01:32.676
I got jealous.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.555
You...

01:38.098 --> 01:39.517
- jealous?
- Yes.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.689
My God, Adriana.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.361
Come here. Sit.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.154
Come here, babe.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.747
You know I wouldn't do anything
to hurt you, right?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.543
Yes. I know.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.294
It was silly.

02:08.712 --> 02:12.800
But I promise the next time we play,
I won't act like this...

02:12.883 --> 02:14.301
Are you out of your mind?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.264
There won't be a next time.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.392
We'll never play
that game again in our lives.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.353
We agreed to save our marriage.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.522
But doing something less harmful.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.482
Really? Like what?

02:28.858 --> 02:30.526
I don't know.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.988
Jumping out of a plane
without a parachute, for example.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.323
Everything's a joke to you.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.200
No, I...

02:41.704 --> 02:42.746
Listen.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.665
Come here.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.293
Come here, sweetheart.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.961
Relax, please.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.883
Yesterday was
an unusual situation, okay?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.677
It's not going to happen again.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.139
And we need to find
the right way to sort this out.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.600
Okay.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.854
You are the love of my life.

03:08.564 --> 03:09.982
I love you.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.445
I love you.
Can you understand that?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.874
THE GAME OF KEYS

03:42.723 --> 03:44.141
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:50.940 --> 03:52.024
Sergio!

03:54.610 --> 03:57.071
Wait a second.
Why are you taking my car?

03:57.154 --> 04:00.282
I'm sorry, sir.
We're seizing your car.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.661
- Your down payment was returned.
- What do you mean?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.080
There must be a mistake.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.791
Sir, I've been doing
this job for 15 years.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.793
I've never made a mistake.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.628
Fuck!

04:13.337 --> 04:15.547
Can we sort this out?

04:21.011 --> 04:22.805
This is Mexico, right?

04:23.180 --> 04:24.723
We can sort this out.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.608
We're okay.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.195
Really, sir?

04:40.489 --> 04:41.699
It's a valid coupon!

04:43.534 --> 04:46.036
- I can explain it.
- Let me guess.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.455
They didn't take bitcoins?

04:49.999 --> 04:52.960
Come on, sir. Take this holy card.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.921
- It's a collectible.
- I don't need that!

04:56.005 --> 04:56.922
Fuck!

04:58.799 --> 05:00.509
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.974
You feel like having
the best blowjob ever?

05:08.892 --> 05:11.687
But in return I want to know
how did it go with Bárbara.

05:12.021 --> 05:15.524
- No. I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?

05:15.607 --> 05:17.568
Because I don't want to.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.155
It gets me horny thinking
you're fucking another woman.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.534
Turning me on doesn't turn you on?

05:29.747 --> 05:30.873
The door!

05:33.208 --> 05:35.794
You weren't saved by the bell.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.883
It must be the yoga teacher.
Come on, Chata.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.898
- Hello?
- Hi.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.735
- I'm here for the dog.
- The dog?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.279
Yes. I talked to Mr. Valentín.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.783
He didn't mention anything.
Honey?

06:06.033 --> 06:09.203
- Somebody's here for the dog.
- Yes. I'm coming.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.081
- Let him in.
- I'm sorry.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.125
- Don't worry. It's okay.
- He's the guy around the corner.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.835
I asked him to give the dog a bath.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.463
- Okay.
- I forgot to mention it.

06:19.630 --> 06:23.008
- I'm glad you're having a bath.
- I'm sorry.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.678
- I'll meditate and take a shower.
- Okay, babe.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.514
- Which way?
- That way, please.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.641
- This is Chata?
- That's right.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.352
It was really amazing.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.145
The hotel is lovely.

06:35.979 --> 06:40.943
He picked some delicious oysters,
and an exquisite champagne.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.737
And that's it.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.533
Then what?

06:48.117 --> 06:51.954
Then I got Siena's call.
And that's all I got.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.916
He didn't get an erection?

06:57.251 --> 06:59.294
Your amazing boobs
didn't do the trick?

06:59.378 --> 07:00.879
No. And they were expensive.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.843
I think Valentín is...

07:06.593 --> 07:08.887
How do you call it
when you can't get an erection?

07:09.221 --> 07:10.305
Impotent?

07:10.389 --> 07:14.560
Leo, I think
Valentín isn't into boobs.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.647
But Gaby's boobs are nice.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.149
Kind of small...

07:21.441 --> 07:24.153
- but firm...
- Leo, enough.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.114
That's not what I meant exactly.
I think...

07:27.948 --> 07:29.783
Valentín is gay.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.618
- Valentín?
- Yes.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.204
- Gay?
- I don't have time for this. Bye.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.623
Wait. Your lunchbox.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.881
- You look gorgeous today.
- Thanks.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.632
- Hand me that.
- Tell me!

07:45.716 --> 07:48.594
- Give me that!
- Why didn't you have sex with him?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.637
I don't want
to talk about that, please!

07:51.013 --> 07:52.514
Why not?

07:52.848 --> 07:55.684
I'm sure you like him
and he likes you.

07:56.602 --> 07:57.936
I really do.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.315
- Sergio!
- Hi.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.317
What a nice surprise.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.361
Did you forget something last night?

08:06.862 --> 08:08.947
- Not exactly.
- Shut up, or I'll kill you.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.034
Hi, Sergio.
What are you doing here?

08:12.326 --> 08:15.329
I was in the neighborhood,
and I wanted to see your office.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.080
It's so nice.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.250
He's all horny.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.755
- It looks great.
- It does indeed.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.135
- It does.
- Hey, you still have work to do?

08:30.469 --> 08:32.179
I thought I could buy you a coffee.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.809
I think so.
We still have a lot of work to do.

08:37.893 --> 08:41.021
It's okay. I can handle it.
We are almost done.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.275
You can take a coffee break.
I think you need it.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.195
Shall we?

08:49.154 --> 08:50.239
Sure.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.034
- Go ahead.
- Bye, Barbs.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.119
Bye!

08:59.748 --> 09:01.917
I thought you'd be mad at me.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.669
Why?

09:12.219 --> 09:14.179
For last night, Sergio.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.350
For what I didn't do last night.

09:18.809 --> 09:22.104
Let me. Last night?
What happened last night?

09:22.354 --> 09:23.981
I forgot.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.776
Thanks.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.531
Tell me. How have you been?

09:32.781 --> 09:33.949
Are you happy?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.826
Sure, I am.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.413
I love my family.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.456
I love my job.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.335
My life isn't as exciting as yours.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.713
But everything works fine.

09:47.963 --> 09:51.008
Sometimes excitement is good.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.801
Sometimes it isn't.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.886
What kind of excitement
does Siena represent?

09:56.305 --> 09:57.806
Siena is...

09:58.807 --> 10:01.226
I don't know.
She is good, for now.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.897
I think she's as unstable as I am,
that's why we get along.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.942
- What about Óscar?
- Óscar?

10:09.651 --> 10:11.987
He is too stable.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.365
- Your check, sir.
- Thank you.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.160
Right.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.924
No, please.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.094
- I said I'd buy you a coffee.
- No, we can split it.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.055
You don't need to buy me.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.058
Thanks.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.102
You know?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.522
I can't discuss this with Siena.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.987
We haven't seen each other in years,
but I trust you.

10:55.238 --> 10:59.201
Let's say
I'm short of money right now.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.577
Really?

11:01.870 --> 11:05.248
What about your investments?

11:05.832 --> 11:10.504
I had to sell all my stock
in order to invest in an app.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.174
I thought it was
an once in a lifetime opportunity.

11:14.299 --> 11:18.095
And I invested all my money...

11:18.804 --> 11:22.349
in my dream.
But in the meantime, I am broke.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.185
- But I think that's great.
- Do you?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.813
You are going after your dream.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.732
You're taking chances,
I never do that.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.527
My life is pretty steady.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.278
Listen.

11:37.656 --> 11:40.784
I'd love to help you.

11:40.951 --> 11:44.037
- It's not much, but...
- Adriana, come on.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.748
You know, I can't...

11:46.957 --> 11:48.792
I can't take your money.

11:48.875 --> 11:53.130
You can pay me back
when you become a millionaire.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.924
- That's what friends are for.
- Thank you.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.511
Can I tell you something?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.848
I never thought you'd marry Óscar.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.561
Why not?

12:08.687 --> 12:11.940
Minutes later,
the second house owner shows up.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.275
He's furious.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.528
And he started crying,
"You cheated on me, bitch."

12:17.279 --> 12:18.655
Then the boyfriend said,

12:18.738 --> 12:21.032
"Please, stop.
The dog groomer is here."

12:21.741 --> 12:24.077
Then they went to the bedroom.

12:24.119 --> 12:28.039
I started hearing screams
that then turned into moans.

12:28.373 --> 12:32.419
Turns out the couple liked
to have wild make-up sex.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.255
I'm sure
your wife loves your stories.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.216
Husband. His name is Juan.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.719
I'm so sorry, Pedro.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.597
I didn't think you were gay.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.724
I mean,
there's nothing wrong with that.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.684
- Sorry.
- No. It's okay.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.978
I mean, it's not a big deal.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.646
I'm just gay.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.734
You know? I've always wondered
how a gay...

12:56.776 --> 12:59.279
- can tell that another man is gay.
- Have you?

12:59.821 --> 13:03.325
Do you just ask him?
How do you notice?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.410
In this homophobic country,

13:05.744 --> 13:08.955
if you dare to ask a man
whether he's gay, he can kill you.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.499
- Sure.
- Right?

13:11.208 --> 13:15.795
Well, let's just say
we have some kind of radar

13:16.880 --> 13:19.090
that lets us know
when someone's gay.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.511
- Really?
- Of course not! I'm just kidding.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.348
The best way to avoid getting killed

13:26.431 --> 13:28.683
is by downloading a gay app.

13:30.435 --> 13:34.272
- Can I show you?
- No. I was just curious.

13:34.856 --> 13:35.899
Just curious, eh?

13:37.067 --> 13:39.694
I mean, I'm writing a book.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.448
- About gay stuff.
- Okay. A book?

13:43.532 --> 13:45.534
- That's right.
- Okay.

13:45.659 --> 13:49.913
Great. I'd love to read it
once it's finished.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.456
Sure!

13:51.706 --> 13:55.043
- Okay. She's done.
- My baby girl.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.004
Kiss me.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.724
- Hi, honey. How was your day?
- Good.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.142
Cool.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.570
Óscar. That's enough.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.197
- What?
- Get up. We're going shopping.

14:24.781 --> 14:25.824
Why?

14:26.491 --> 14:30.120
Because we agreed that we're going
to work on our marriage.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.081
It's not nice to come home
and see you in your slippers.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.875
It's not sexy at all, Óscar.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.964
- It was a present from Mica.
- It's always your same answer.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.674
That's enough!

14:44.134 --> 14:45.218
Please.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.306
Okay?

14:50.682 --> 14:51.725
Okay.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.185
Let's go.

15:18.293 --> 15:23.131
I think this jacket
would look great on you, baby.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.258
Great, sure.

15:25.342 --> 15:29.262
I mean, if you like it.
Because we have more options.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.476
Look!

15:37.020 --> 15:40.106
Look. This one is cool.
Do you like it?

15:58.667 --> 16:00.335
Try this.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.260
Hello? Lucía?

16:10.053 --> 16:13.640
How are you?
No, I'm not home. Why?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.519
Yes. I know.

16:17.936 --> 16:21.856
I interviewed three prospects
and none of them were eligible.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.320
Hang up the phone.
Tell her you'll get back to her.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.281
- Hang up.
- Can I call you back?

16:30.824 --> 16:33.535
Okay. Fine.
I'll talk to you later.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.537
Sergio!

16:36.079 --> 16:39.708
- He's suitable for the job.
- Sergio? Sure.

16:39.791 --> 16:44.087
- Yes.
- He's a millionaire.

16:44.629 --> 16:48.883
He's waiting to figure out
something about an app.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.677
I'm sure he can help you.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.764
I don't think
he wants to get involved

16:55.265 --> 16:58.351
with toilet paper
or sanitary products.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.770
Are you sure? Give it a try.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.859
You work around the clock,
you can use the help.

17:08.403 --> 17:12.282
Look, why don't you go out
with him and the others tonight?

17:12.574 --> 17:16.077
You can show off your new look,
that suits you great,

17:16.161 --> 17:17.746
and then you can approach Sergio.

17:17.912 --> 17:21.040
We agreed to watch a movie
with Mica tonight.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.752
We didn't. It's lady's night.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.714
- Okay.
- Call Sergio and the others.

17:27.756 --> 17:31.050
You can go out for dinner
or something relax.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.688
Okay, gentlemen.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.066
Hey, buddy. You said
we were going to a bar,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.153
not a human trafficking joint.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.446
This is a bar

17:51.613 --> 17:55.450
which also features naked women
dancing, by their own will.

17:55.784 --> 17:59.412
There's another joint nearby
with a superb whisky.

18:00.038 --> 18:03.750
- Okay. Let's go.
- We've just arrived. Listen.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.169
Let me tell you something.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.005
If within the hour
you still want to leave,

18:09.464 --> 18:11.174
I'll give you 2000 pesos each.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.468
Otherwise, you'll pay me.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.055
- Okay. Fine, why not?
- Deal.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.441
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.735
- Here, your glass of wine.
- Thanks.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.114
- Where's Bárbara?
- She'll be right here.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.660
I asked her to be here later.
I wanted to talk to you first.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.832
Are you still upset about last night?
How are you?

18:45.291 --> 18:46.668
I'm not upset.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.129
I mean, I was last night.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.257
But I came back to my senses.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.593
I know you. Are you sure?

18:55.927 --> 18:58.680
I'm sure. We are fine, okay?

19:03.268 --> 19:07.021
That's the point of the game.
No one needs to apologize.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.317
Then tell me.
Why didn't you fuck Sergio?

19:11.693 --> 19:13.903
You've been wanting
to do that since school.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.655
- What happened?
- I know.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.158
- It was you?
- Hello!

19:19.534 --> 19:22.161
- Hi!
- Am I interrupting?

19:22.745 --> 19:25.206
The traffic was so heavy.

19:25.290 --> 19:29.085
Stop. She knows everything.
We are all good.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.087
- We are good.
- What's this?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.213
Wine.

19:33.631 --> 19:34.591
Waiter.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.468
Tequila, please. Neat.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.304
A bottle.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.436
Take it all off!

19:49.188 --> 19:51.774
You are so talented, baby.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.902
Here, this is for your tuition.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.822
You know your job, Ludwi.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.004
Now, it's time.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.964
Shall we leave or shall you pay?

20:15.256 --> 20:18.927
- Here is your money.
- I'm staying.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.513
It's a pleasure
doing business with you, guys.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.182
- Here.
- Thanks.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.516
Excellent.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.984
Really?

20:35.693 --> 20:38.613
I was in third grade.

20:38.780 --> 20:42.283
I was chosen for this girl
Mary's role in the Christmas play.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.203
You mean Virgin Mary!

20:46.329 --> 20:48.873
If your mom could hear you,
she'd kill you.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.294
I remember practicing 24/7.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.838
And when I made
my debut as an actress...

20:56.756 --> 20:58.466
guess what happened?

20:59.801 --> 21:00.969
Nothing!

21:01.511 --> 21:04.222
- I was just standing there.
- Really?

21:04.347 --> 21:05.765
The poor Joseph was left

21:05.848 --> 21:08.226
in the nativity scene
talking to himself.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.270
I've always been such a coward.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.857
I think she's referring
to The Game of Keys.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.110
I mean, she's comparing...

21:17.527 --> 21:21.864
Joseph is... She's comparing
Joseph to Sergio.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.825
No, you are wrong.

21:24.492 --> 21:25.952
According to her.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.748
Of course not!
Sergio has nothing to do with it.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.792
What I mean is...

21:33.626 --> 21:36.963
Óscar doesn't want to fuck again!

21:37.213 --> 21:39.132
- Why not?
- Because!

21:39.507 --> 21:41.676
I can't persuade him anymore!

21:42.677 --> 21:44.887
- Hi! May I?
- Please.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.807
- Your name is Ludwi?
- That's right.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.350
Hey, Ludwi.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.395
I was wondering...

21:53.021 --> 21:57.567
Would you have a drink
with me and my friends? I'm Leo.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.320
Sure. I can't turn you down.
You are so cute.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.158
You are cute too.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.077
- You are done.
- Somebody help him, please.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.246
Are you from the north
of the country?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.707
Yes.
From Hermosillo, to be exact.

22:13.166 --> 22:17.378
Hey, well.
My shift ends in about an hour.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.882
Tell me. Do you wait for me
and leave together?

22:24.177 --> 22:26.804
Wait. Come on, Ludwi.
I would hate to exploit you.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.850
You're the only one
who's going to explode, handsome.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.604
Handsome!

22:35.646 --> 22:38.983
I'll give you my number
in case you change your mind.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.235
Come on, write it down!

22:41.569 --> 22:42.779
Tell me.

22:43.154 --> 22:45.698
- Let's visualize...
- Fucking?

22:45.907 --> 22:47.075
Fucking.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.828
- Obviously!
- As Gaby says...

22:51.037 --> 22:55.291
- We need to visualize and manifest.
- Right. To visualization.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.462
What are we visualizing?
That Óscar wants to fuck again.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.091
Did you see that, boys?

23:04.133 --> 23:06.844
- Are you leaving with her?
- Of course not.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.764
I'm just joking.

23:09.847 --> 23:13.518
But my sexual fantasy
is banging a whore.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.772
My fantasy is having sex with seven,
I've only had six and a half.

23:20.691 --> 23:23.945
I dream of Mary Jane,
Spiderman's girlfriend.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.326
- And you, Valentín?
- What?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.829
- Who would you like to fuck?
- Me?

23:33.579 --> 23:34.705
You.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.669
- Gaby.
- Fuck off!

23:40.002 --> 23:42.588
To Gaby!

23:42.964 --> 23:44.590
To Gaby, indeed!

23:46.300 --> 23:47.677
Come on, let's do it.

23:48.553 --> 23:52.181
- Here we go. Visualize that...
- I hold the bottle.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.978
It's like holding an electrode.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.899
- "I want to fuck."
- You idiots.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.109
Who?

24:03.568 --> 24:06.654
"I want to fuck."

24:07.822 --> 24:09.448
"I want to fuck."

24:09.949 --> 24:12.160
- I need to fuck.
- You really do.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.079
- Shut up!
- You really need it!

24:16.581 --> 24:17.707
Cheers.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.919
You can tell me... anything.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.048
- Anything...
- I...

24:26.841 --> 24:30.428
I need some help at the office.

24:32.972 --> 24:33.931
I mean...

24:34.307 --> 24:36.392
We are a small company...

24:36.642 --> 24:39.270
but Adriana thought

24:39.395 --> 24:42.190
that you might be interested
in the job.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.775
- Work for me.
- I can do that.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.362
I'm in, bro.

24:49.030 --> 24:52.283
- I can't say no to you.
- Really?

24:52.366 --> 24:54.869
Sure, buddy.
I'm being serious.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.038
I'm serious.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.083
I can start tomorrow.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.795
Not now. I can't, I'm busy.

25:07.757 --> 25:09.759
I like you.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.805
Sergio has a background
in advertising agencies.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.559
- Including Apple.
- That's right.

25:18.851 --> 25:22.438
I've worked in almost
every major company, as a freelancer.

25:23.564 --> 25:24.815
Well, yes.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.818
Your resume is awesome.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.321
We're trying to sell tampons,

25:30.404 --> 25:32.990
how can we benefit
from your experience?

25:34.408 --> 25:37.411
Look, Lucía. If I learned anything
from working in advertising...

25:37.745 --> 25:39.413
in Apple with Steve...

25:39.580 --> 25:42.917
is that a product
isn't just a product.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.920
So, a tampon isn't just a tampon.

25:46.337 --> 25:50.716
It's something else.
It's comfort, it's confidence...

25:52.301 --> 25:54.887
It's a warm blanket on a cold night.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.892
He's qualified.

26:00.851 --> 26:04.897
Óscar said you needed some help,
and I would gladly help you.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.775
Well, then. Done.

26:10.111 --> 26:12.029
Welcome to Condesa Studios.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.783
Excellent! Thank you, Lucía.
You won't regret this.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.669
What do you think?

26:26.836 --> 26:28.045
"Lady...

26:29.046 --> 26:30.756
Feel the luxury."

26:33.134 --> 26:34.468
I don't know.

26:35.636 --> 26:39.056
Don't you think we're focusing
on the wrong perspective?

26:40.099 --> 26:43.102
How would you persuade Adriana
to buy it?

26:43.728 --> 26:44.770
Coffee?

26:45.771 --> 26:46.981
No, thanks.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.358
What does she have to do with this?

26:49.775 --> 26:51.068
I don't know.

26:51.193 --> 26:53.029
Adriana... Just think.

26:53.237 --> 26:56.073
She is a modern,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.367
full-time working woman...

26:59.035 --> 27:00.536
but she's also a housewife.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.497
A sexy, hot, gorgeous lady.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.335
Don't you know
what your wife wants?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.837
Right now? She wants more sex.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.674
Or that I wear cooler clothes.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.427
That has nothing to do with tampons.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.138
No. It isn't just that, buddy.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.265
I think she...

27:22.183 --> 27:26.354
wants more from life.
I don't think she's a conformist.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.358
You're wrong.
You don't know her as I do.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.902
My wife loves her life.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.613
Right.

27:35.738 --> 27:38.157
Maybe you don't know women
well enough.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.658
You do?

27:41.911 --> 27:44.538
I've been with lots of women. So...

27:44.997 --> 27:47.583
yes, I know more about women
than you do.

27:50.878 --> 27:53.130
If you knew
what women like Adriana want...

27:53.839 --> 27:57.301
you would have managed
to have sex with her, wouldn't you?

28:06.394 --> 28:08.437
What do you say, handsome?

28:08.813 --> 28:10.689
You can have all these...

28:12.274 --> 28:15.694
The two of us for the price of one.
Come on, say yes.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.780
We'll be waiting for you.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.171
How much for "mouth pleasure"?

28:35.339 --> 28:38.259
"Mouth pleasure"? That’s not a thing.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.679
- Bárbara, stay focused!
- Okay! But it isn't.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.514
- Fine. Just do it.
- Okay!

28:44.807 --> 28:46.434
5,000 pesos.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.688
And I can take you to the stars...

28:50.771 --> 28:55.317
Bárbara, come on.
You're profiting from your monopoly.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.653
Focus, Leo!

28:58.571 --> 28:59.738
Okay.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.490
Keep going.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.075
5,000 pesos...

29:04.660 --> 29:07.663
and I'll make you forget
your monopoly.

29:08.372 --> 29:12.668
I will exploit your natural resources
and take control...

29:13.294 --> 29:15.337
over your reproductive system.

29:17.131 --> 29:20.092
Get in.
I want to shove my dick up your tits.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.346
Come closer.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.558
I want to fuck you.
Come here.

29:28.309 --> 29:29.643
Let's go.

29:30.227 --> 29:31.687
Start driving.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.606
Okay. Let's go to Revolución Avenue.

29:33.689 --> 29:36.066
- Let people see us.
- Yes.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.778
Here's your sponge.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.907
- Thank you, babe.
- You're welcome.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.701
- Don't you want to join me?
- It would be nice.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.786
Let me finish my beer
and I'll join you, okay?

29:48.204 --> 29:49.163
Okay.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.936
Sorry. I need to take this.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.396
- Shall I pause it?
- No. It's okay.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.857
You update me later.

30:20.528 --> 30:21.529
Hello?

30:22.029 --> 30:23.739
Hey. Can you talk?

30:25.366 --> 30:26.534
Yes. I can.

30:29.078 --> 30:31.038
Is everything okay?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.249
Yes. I'm fine.

30:33.958 --> 30:37.795
Guess what?
I heard OV7 will be in concert.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.881
- I got tickets.
- Really?

30:41.590 --> 30:42.925
That's so cool.

30:43.592 --> 30:47.221
Óscar hates OV7.

30:47.721 --> 30:48.514
Really?

30:49.306 --> 30:50.641
I'm sorry.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.519
Siena won't go either.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.230
Will you come with me?

30:58.691 --> 31:03.737
Are you asking me out?
Like on a date?

31:04.780 --> 31:06.365
Well, that's up to you.

31:07.658 --> 31:12.037
Or we could be two friends
recalling old times.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.420
It's okay if you say no.
I can sell the tickets.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.213
I...

31:22.756 --> 31:25.384
I don't think that's a good idea.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.599
Listen.

31:31.974 --> 31:35.603
Okay. But think it over.
We still have time.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.605
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:39.690 --> 31:40.691
Fine.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.359
Kisses.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.222
Who was it?

32:13.057 --> 32:14.016
Bárbara.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.853
It was work.

32:28.656 --> 32:29.782
Thanks.
