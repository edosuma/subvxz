WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:05.048
So?

00:05.092 --> 00:06.354
What?

00:06.397 --> 00:08.921
You didn't come down here
at the crack of dawn

00:08.965 --> 00:10.140
because you missed me.

00:10.184 --> 00:14.492
Well, now that
you mention it...

00:14.536 --> 00:16.668
Billy.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.237
Mom, this is Billy Coyle.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.630
Billy is in my
microeconomics seminar.

00:21.673 --> 00:22.631
Here, Billy.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.502
Morning, Ms. Reagan.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.852
Billy.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.332
Billy has a problem.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.160
I was hoping you could
give him some advice.

00:30.204 --> 00:33.033
Does this problem involve
a case being prosecuted

00:33.076 --> 00:34.860
at the Manhattan
District Attorney's Office?

00:34.904 --> 00:36.558
Yes, ma'am.Then I'm afraid

00:36.601 --> 00:38.516
I can't discuss it without
your attorney being present.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.431
My public defender said
it was okay

00:40.475 --> 00:42.085
if I feel like I can trust you.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.174
From everything
that he's told me, I can.

00:45.306 --> 00:48.091
Okay. What happened?

00:48.135 --> 00:51.442
I was at a bar near campus
with some friends.

00:51.486 --> 00:54.402
We heard an argument and
the sound of a bottle breaking,

00:54.445 --> 00:56.708
and then this guy
just hit the floor.Sounds scary.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.362
The police showed up.
They started asking questions,

00:58.406 --> 01:00.451
and next thing I know,
I'm under arrest.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.758
Billy was arraigned
for felony assault.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.890
My lawyer said the cops
have an eyewitness

01:04.934 --> 01:07.110
who said that she saw me
hit this guy.

01:07.154 --> 01:10.113
The A.D.A. offered Billy a plea
deal for misdemeanor assault.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.288
For something I didn't do.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.594
What did your lawyer say?

01:12.637 --> 01:14.378
Well, he told me
to take the deal.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.772
He said that a felony trial
was too risky.

01:16.815 --> 01:22.299
But if I plead guilty,
I'll lose my scholarship.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.519
I'll have to drop out
of school.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.147
MAN:
Whoop-whoop!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.063
Got a gun!

02:00.337 --> 02:01.904
Get down!

02:04.646 --> 02:06.604
Get down! Get down!

02:06.648 --> 02:09.041
Get on the ground now!
All the way down!

02:10.130 --> 02:11.087
MAN:
Ayuda!

02:11.131 --> 02:14.177
Policía, ayuda!

02:14.221 --> 02:16.571
Ayuda, por favor!

02:34.806 --> 02:36.721
Central,
I'm at the Bedford Complex.

02:36.765 --> 02:40.986
We need a bus to the location
forthwith! Forthwith!

02:41.030 --> 02:43.815
Okay. It's okay. Okay.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.861
All right.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.215
Boss, I got bad news.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.434
Bring it.

02:53.477 --> 02:54.870
A shoot-out between
two of our officers

02:54.913 --> 02:57.264
and a couple
of drug dealers.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.830
Our cops are both fine.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.092
Who's not fine?

03:00.136 --> 03:03.313
One of the dealers
and an 11-year-old girl.

03:03.357 --> 03:06.969
Collateral damage?

03:07.012 --> 03:08.927
A bullet from one
of our officers' guns hit her

03:08.971 --> 03:11.321
through her first floor
apartment window.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.846
How is she?

03:14.890 --> 03:17.066
Doesn't look good.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.242
Her family?

03:19.286 --> 03:21.375
Our best people
are with them.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.898
And my officer?

03:22.941 --> 03:24.421
Like I said,
neither was injured.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.118
Well, one sure was.

03:26.162 --> 03:30.427
A bullet from his weapon
hit an 11-year-old girl.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.734
That's a grave wound
a cop takes.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.356
Any bosses on the scene?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.792
Yes, sir, right there.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.447
Who's in charge?

03:50.491 --> 03:52.232
Nobody gets in or out.Who's in charge here?

03:52.275 --> 03:53.015
You lost?

03:53.058 --> 03:54.321
No, I was working a case

03:54.364 --> 03:55.452
a couple blocks away.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.801
Job came over the air.
What do we got?

03:56.845 --> 03:58.455
Smash and grab
in the jewelry store.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.718
Guard stepped up, took
a bullet for his trouble.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.198
The call said hostages.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.026
Yeah, three. Perp says
he'll shoot 'em one by one

04:04.069 --> 04:05.027
if we don't back off.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.550
Well, how's the guard doing?

04:06.594 --> 04:08.465
I don't know, but hostage
negotiators are on their way.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.467
Got to give 'em a chance
to talk him out.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.295
We wait for them,
the guard bleeds out,

04:12.339 --> 04:14.210
there's a good chance this guy's
gonna take out another hostage.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.473
Right now we contain the perp
and wait for HNT.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.649
Okay? I got a team
situated around the back,

04:18.693 --> 04:19.694
ready to go in on my order.

04:19.737 --> 04:20.869
Back them up.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.914
No, this guy bleeds out,
it's on us.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.786
Back them up. Wait for my order.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.309
Okay.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.963
Anybody else comes in,

04:28.006 --> 04:29.138
I want 'em right here, okay?

04:29.181 --> 04:30.400
See if we can get
anybody up here.

04:30.444 --> 04:32.315
Hey, Sarge.Hey, Lieutenant.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.404
What do we know about
the hostage taker?He's early to mid-20s,

04:34.448 --> 04:36.667
behavior's really erratic.
Could be drugs on board.

04:36.711 --> 04:37.886
Got all the exits covered?

04:37.929 --> 04:39.061
Yeah, front and back.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.324
OFFICER:
Shots fired, shots fired!

04:41.368 --> 04:42.282
What's going on in there?

04:43.935 --> 04:45.807
Coming out!

04:45.850 --> 04:47.112
Coming out! Hold your fire!

04:48.288 --> 04:49.550
It's all clear.
Perp's down.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.812
OFFICER :
Perp's down. Moving in.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.731
That's your
brother, right?Yeah.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.733
The stones on
him, huh?

05:24.889 --> 05:27.762
Hang in there,
okay, bud?

05:27.805 --> 05:29.241
Whew, that was
a close call.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.286
Well done.Nice job, Reagan.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.287
I just grabbed the guy.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.420
Detective...
can I have a word?

05:33.463 --> 05:35.639
Yeah. I'll
see you guys.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.424
Hey. He's gonna
make it, the guard.
Yeah.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.296
Lucky he's the only one
that came out on a stretcher.Meaning what?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.037
You were supposed to wait
for my order before going in.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.214
Well, I know, but, uh,
yahoo turned his back,

05:45.257 --> 05:47.303
I had a clear path. What
do you want me to do?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.609
That wasn't
the game plan, Danny.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.393
I know it wasn't the
game plan, but it worked.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.655
The shot that perp threw
when you went in

05:51.699 --> 05:52.743
could've hit one
of the hostages.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.049
No, it couldn't have hit anyone.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.529
Look, I had him
completely under control.

05:55.572 --> 05:58.270
Everything was fine.That's easy to say now.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.055
What do you want me to do?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.404
Look, I had a chance
to end this thing.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.927
For all of us.
So I ended it.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.102
You could've checked with me
before you went in.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.061
There wasn't time.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.584
That's protocol.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.456
Protocol, fine.
But I saved lives.

06:09.499 --> 06:12.589
We saved lives.You could've cost someone
their life.

06:12.633 --> 06:13.895
Yeah, and you, while waiting to

06:13.938 --> 06:15.287
play Dog Day Afternoon
with that clown,

06:15.331 --> 06:16.419
could've let the
guard bleed out

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
and cost him his life!
Coulda, shoulda,

06:17.681 --> 06:19.074
woulda...I was the incident commander.

06:19.117 --> 06:22.338
It was my call, not yours.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.822
You're welcome.

06:30.215 --> 06:33.523
I talked to the A.D.A. handling
Nicky's friend's case.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.786
And?The cops on the
scene say, uh,

06:35.830 --> 06:39.573
a witness saw Billy Coyle
clock the vic upside the head

06:39.616 --> 06:41.139
with a bottle.How's the victim?

06:41.183 --> 06:43.751
Uh, concussion, caught
some glass in one eye.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.666
Vision could be impaired.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.364
Billy doesn't seem
like a violent type.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.713
Well, he's got
a clean record.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.977
Which is why Stevens offered
him misdemeanor assault.

06:53.021 --> 06:55.327
Which could cost him
his scholarship.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.112
Well, it beats the hell
out of jail.

06:59.549 --> 07:00.637
What?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.030
I wouldn't even know
about this case

07:02.073 --> 07:03.510
if he wasn't Nicky's friend.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.772
So?

07:04.815 --> 07:06.861
So, using the authority
of this office

07:06.904 --> 07:08.776
to aid friends
and family is wrong.

07:08.819 --> 07:11.082
I fixed plenty of tickets
before the bosses

07:11.126 --> 07:12.997
got their panties
in a twist about it.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.478
Well, that's wrong, too.Yeah, but it happens
all the time.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.394
People in your life need help.
You're gonna turn your back?

07:18.438 --> 07:21.092
Help is one thing.
A favor is another.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.572
Forget that you know this kid.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.574
Case falls out
of the clear blue sky

07:24.618 --> 07:26.315
onto your desk.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.316
Bar fights are messy.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.884
Witnesses are usually drunk.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.625
The kid could be
telling the truth.

07:31.668 --> 07:34.758
He's still Nicky's friend.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.934
But if he's innocent,
he deserves justice

07:36.978 --> 07:38.588
no matter who he knows.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.903
As you were.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.821
Have a seat, Officer Green.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.737
Yes, sir.

08:01.393 --> 08:04.396
I assume you know
about ballistics?

08:04.440 --> 08:07.748
Uh, bullet that killed the girl
came from my gun.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.532
Afraid so.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.925
But they opened up
on us, Commissioner.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.535
We had to return fire.

08:12.579 --> 08:16.365
I read the report. I see no
reason to question your actions.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.975
'Cause on the news,
they're making it sound like

08:18.019 --> 08:19.760
I meant to kill the girl.
Or could care less.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.676
Best tune out that noise
for now.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.766
You here to take my shield?

08:25.809 --> 08:28.986
No.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.641
I make it my business
to check on all my cops

08:31.685 --> 08:33.513
when they've been hurt
in the line of duty.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.950
But it's not like
I was injured.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.607
But how are you feeling?

08:40.650 --> 08:45.089
Oh, um... yeah.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.656
Uh...

08:46.700 --> 08:52.053
You know, this can be
its own kind of injury.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.620
Yes.

08:53.663 --> 08:57.972
Sometimes, tragedies happen
on this job.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.670
But that's not on you.
You did your duty.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.716
I got to believe that.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.764
You know, my old man
was career Army.

09:07.808 --> 09:10.288
He said,

09:10.332 --> 09:15.293
"Doing your duty isn't part
of the job. It is the job."

09:15.337 --> 09:18.862
That's exactly right.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.868
But if you feel the need,
the department has resources.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.783
Just saying.

09:26.827 --> 09:29.525
Thank you, sir.
I'll keep that in mind.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.833
Thank you, Officer Green.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.847
Wow. Bring back memories?

09:46.890 --> 09:48.892
I went to college to study,
not to hang out in bars.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.938
I never went to college.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.767
Pretty much everything I know,
I learned in joints like this.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.769
That explains
a lot, actually.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.771
I'm sure it does.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.338
Hey.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.689
Oh, good. More cops.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.692
Actually, we're with the
district attorney's office.Whatever.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.650
What's your name?

10:07.694 --> 10:09.870
J.J.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.741
You here the night
the kid was assaulted, J.J.?

10:11.785 --> 10:12.786
I was.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.483
You see anything?Negative.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.745
Bar was packed.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.791
I was up to my elbows
in drunk collegians.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.619
You guys got security cameras?

10:19.662 --> 10:21.621
We don't support
the surveillance state.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.624
Thanks for your help.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.931
I'm surprised no one's
taken a bottle to his head.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.063
Really.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.502
Did you review
the evidence?

10:33.545 --> 10:35.939
Everything NYPD
sent over.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.027
What does that mean?

10:37.071 --> 10:38.942
Well, detective that
caught the case

10:38.986 --> 10:42.380
did a follow-up interview
with the girl who I.D.'d Billy.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.948
His DD5 is still
in their system.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.167
Well, those notes
are critical

10:46.210 --> 10:48.648
in assessing the
reliability of the I.D.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.040
When are we
gonna get those?

10:50.084 --> 10:53.217
As soon as the detective
gets back from Barbados.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.741
End of next week.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.873
End of next week?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.919
If Billy rejects
the plea offer,

10:58.962 --> 11:01.095
his case will go to
the grand jury in three days.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.488
Well, the C.O. won't grant us
access to the report

11:03.532 --> 11:05.577
without a sign-off from One PP.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.797
Ugh.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.847
What the hell is this?

11:13.890 --> 11:15.370
Notification of
Command Discipline.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.850
Yeah, I know what
the hell it is.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.112
You actually wrote me up?

11:18.155 --> 11:20.418
I had no choice.The hell you didn't!

11:20.462 --> 11:22.899
You disobeyed
a direct order, Danny.Come on, a perp

11:22.943 --> 11:25.859
puts a bullet in one hostage,
it's only a matter of time

11:25.902 --> 11:27.556
before he puts a bullet
in another hostage.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.079
Statistics don't support that.Statis...

11:29.123 --> 11:31.342
You're gonna throw statistics
in my face?!

11:31.386 --> 11:33.649
You went rogue!I didn't go rogue!
I saved lives!

11:33.693 --> 11:35.085
What the hell
is wrong with that?

11:35.129 --> 11:36.870
I run my crime scenes
by the book.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.872
Oh, your crime scenes?
How many crime scenes

11:38.915 --> 11:42.266
have you run there, boss? Enough to know that
the rules are the rules.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.922
Well, maybe one day you
will have run enough to know
that results are results.

11:45.966 --> 11:49.012
You think I'm gonna take
a hit for doing my job,
you better think again.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.319
Hey, I'm not done. As the
ranking officer on the scene,

11:51.362 --> 11:52.624
I did what I had to do.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.974
And I'm gonna do
what I have to do

11:54.017 --> 11:55.192
as a first grade detective.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.553
DANNY:
Put yourself

12:08.597 --> 12:09.859
in my shoes, okay?

12:09.903 --> 12:12.035
You're working a case
outside the precinct.

12:12.079 --> 12:15.082
A call comes in, 10-30, robbery
in progress, shots fired.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.823
So what do you do?

12:16.866 --> 12:17.998
I hightail it to the scene.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.390
That's right,
you roll up

12:19.434 --> 12:21.523
and there's a hostage inside
with a bullet in him.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.090
Danny, I...So, an opportunity

12:23.133 --> 12:26.267
suddenly presents itself
to take out the perp. Okay?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.095
You know if you hesitate
for one second,

12:28.138 --> 12:29.618
that opportunity is lost.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.098
So what do you do?

12:31.141 --> 12:33.013
I go in.That's right.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.450
You put your ass on the
line, you save the day,

12:35.493 --> 12:37.060
and what do you
get in return?

12:37.104 --> 12:38.801
A black mark
on your record?

12:38.845 --> 12:41.108
Look, all I'm saying...Oh, and then...

12:41.151 --> 12:43.545
you go to the boss in charge,
who in this case, yeah,

12:43.588 --> 12:45.982
happens to be my kid brother,
who's a pain in the ass.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.375
You plead your case,

12:47.418 --> 12:48.680
but he won't budge.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.160
So what do you do then?

12:50.204 --> 12:52.206
Come on, what
do you do then?

12:52.249 --> 12:54.817
I call the chief of D's.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.951
Exactly.
You call the chief of D's.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.430
No. Why me?

12:59.474 --> 13:02.085
Because when two cops disagree
on a disciplinary matter,

13:02.129 --> 13:03.521
that's yourportfolio.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.262
Not when they're both
named Reagan, it's not.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.655
How do you figure?'Cause this thing

13:06.698 --> 13:09.005
blowing up in the papers is
our biggest concern,

13:09.049 --> 13:10.485
and that's yourportfolio.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.923
Get in here.Close the door.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.011
What's going on?

13:15.055 --> 13:16.186
Has the boss seen the memo

13:16.230 --> 13:17.709
from the chief
of detectives yet?

13:17.753 --> 13:19.537
About Jamie and Danny? Not yet.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.844
Then we still got time.For what?

13:21.888 --> 13:24.368
To talk some sense into
the Reagan boys and
leave Frank out of it.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.109
And who's gonna do that?

13:27.023 --> 13:28.155
You.You.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.635
Forget it.
It's way above my pay grade.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.813
Plus, I barely know them.
It's got to be one of you guys.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.902
And you boil it down,

13:35.945 --> 13:38.600
it's a police personnel issue,
not a PR one.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.210
Exactly.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.821
You know what?
I'll tell you what--

13:41.864 --> 13:44.345
let's draw straws.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.610
Ms. Peterson,
thank you for seeing me.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.046
Uh, Kelly. Please.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.743
Sit down.Thank you.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.139
I reviewed the case file
you sent over.

13:56.183 --> 14:00.056
Mr. Coyle is accused
of a pretty serious crime.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.450
Well, he claims he's innocent,
but I have not received

14:02.493 --> 14:04.321
all the paperwork
from the NYPD.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.541
Which I understand is
an ongoing issue.

14:06.584 --> 14:09.631
We have asked for a searchable
database for NYPD investigations

14:09.674 --> 14:11.459
more times than I can count.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.678
And gotten a no from One PP.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.072
Exactly the same
number of times.

14:16.116 --> 14:19.510
In Billy's case, we do need
the PC to authorize access

14:19.554 --> 14:22.209
to the case file to retrieve
a key set of notes.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.776
And you're afraid if you
approach Frank directly,

14:24.820 --> 14:27.823
it will look like you're trying
to undermine his position

14:27.867 --> 14:30.217
on the databases?Exactly.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.696
Mm-hmm.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.481
Are you?

14:34.525 --> 14:36.701
This is one kid in trouble.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.442
Who would then set a precedent.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.358
I do think a shared
database is a good idea.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.360
Transparency would
weed out weak cases

14:43.404 --> 14:45.319
and wrongful prosecutions.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.929
So do judges and juries.Right.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.931
But by that time,
many defendants

14:48.975 --> 14:52.282
have already suffered harm:
incarceration, lost wages,

14:52.326 --> 14:53.849
attorney's fees.
If Billy is indicted,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.330
his future is already over

14:56.373 --> 14:59.376
before he even sets foot
in that courtroom.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.425
As a rule,
I only engage the commissioner

15:04.468 --> 15:07.515
on professional matters
as a last resort.

15:07.558 --> 15:10.344
We have butted heads
several times recently.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.263
Because he treats you more like
a daughter than a colleague?

15:16.306 --> 15:17.873
No, that's not it.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.441
We check the family crest
at the office doors.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.270
Then what's keeping you
from his office door?

15:24.532 --> 15:26.969
It's easier said
than done sometimes.

15:27.013 --> 15:31.843
So I came to you, because he
likes and respects you.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.150
Well, the feeling is mutual,
but he's a bear

15:34.194 --> 15:36.413
when he thinks
he's right about something.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.328
Which is pretty much...

15:38.372 --> 15:40.461
always.Always.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.988
Doesn't your family have
an attorney on retainer?

15:46.032 --> 15:47.250
Why?

15:47.294 --> 15:49.122
Well, don't you think
that's kind of unusual,

15:49.165 --> 15:52.386
for a family with the depth and
breadth of influence like yours

15:52.429 --> 15:54.431
not to have a-a fixer?

15:54.475 --> 15:56.999
Well, I have my colleagues,

15:57.043 --> 15:59.349
and my father has
his legal department;

15:59.393 --> 16:01.743
my brothers have their unions.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.919
I guess you're right.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.443
But you really think what?

16:06.487 --> 16:11.318
Maybe your family,
collectively and deep down,

16:11.361 --> 16:14.103
knows that any attorney
you would want to hire

16:14.147 --> 16:16.932
wouldn't touch that position
with a ten-foot pole.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.413
Erin...

16:19.456 --> 16:22.329
I'd like to help you,

16:22.372 --> 16:25.767
but the NYPD has a right
to protect its databases.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.551
And the defendants have a right

16:27.595 --> 16:29.814
to weigh the evidence
against them.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.208
I'm the corporation counsel.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.297
I'm not a mediator.

16:34.341 --> 16:37.344
I'm afraid you're on your own.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.309
Mom.Hi.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.268
Why didn't you use
the intercom?

16:48.311 --> 16:50.618
The door was open.
Did I wake you?

16:50.661 --> 16:52.359
Uh, no, not exactly.

16:52.402 --> 16:55.057
Okay, well, I'm sorry I
didn't call before I came over.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.538
I just wanted to give you
an update on Billy's case.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.454
Great. Is it okay if
we do that tomorrow?Sure, I just thought you...

17:00.497 --> 17:02.934
Hey, let me pay
for the pizza.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.068
Billy.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.461
Hey, Ms. Reagan.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.115
Uh, Mom, I-I can explain...

17:09.158 --> 17:10.768
No, no, I, uh...

17:10.812 --> 17:12.509
I think I get it.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.468
Enjoy that pizza.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.004
What's up?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.311
I don't know.
You tell me what's up.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.574
Got a message from my C.O.
that said you wanted to talk.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.445
That's funny, 'cause
I got the same message.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.665
Well, I really got
nothing to say.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.319
Then what the hell
are we doing here?

17:39.362 --> 17:41.495
'Cause I got nothing
to say to you, either.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.845
JAMIE:
All right.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.591
That's why we're here.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.465
What's the deal, boss?

17:55.509 --> 17:57.859
Damn good question. Sit.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.776
That's not a friendly request.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.222
To the boys in blue.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.399
Down the hatch.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.364
Well... I feel better.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.279
Look, boss...

18:26.322 --> 18:28.890
No, you've done enough talking,
both of you. Time to listen up.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.761
I expect this
crap from guys

18:30.805 --> 18:32.894
who don't know what's what,
all right?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.635
Not from a couple of Reagans.

18:34.678 --> 18:35.592
All due respect, boss...

18:35.636 --> 18:36.898
No, zip it.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.466
Today I got a call
from the chief of patrol,

18:39.509 --> 18:40.510
who's currently
duking it out

18:40.554 --> 18:42.077
with the chief of D's

18:42.121 --> 18:43.992
over a certain
hostage operation.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.560
Certain successful
hostage operation.Whatever!

18:46.603 --> 18:49.867
This thing's got
to be settled right now.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.088
The Command Discipline
was legit.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.655
The Command Discipline was crap.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.483
So then take it
to the trial room.I'll see you there.

18:56.526 --> 18:57.571
All right, listen!

18:57.614 --> 18:58.746
You take this

18:58.789 --> 19:00.095
to the trial room,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.184
it's gonna land
on the PC's desk,

19:02.228 --> 19:04.099
then in the papers, okay?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.622
Reagan versus Reagan.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.538
You really want to embarrass
your old man like that?

19:15.371 --> 19:16.677
Thank you.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.157
Here.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.159
Let's drink to the fallen,

19:20.202 --> 19:23.510
shake hands and move
the hell on, shall we?

19:25.207 --> 19:27.427
I don't want
to embarrass my father,

19:27.470 --> 19:29.385
but the chain of command
is sacred.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.387
He taught me that.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.569
Well, my old man taught me...

19:39.613 --> 19:42.442
that saving lives is
what the job's all about.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.618
That's all that I did.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.402
And you can be damn sure...

19:46.446 --> 19:48.839
that I will never apologize
for that.

20:05.943 --> 20:09.338
What's your stake
in the assault case
you sent over?

20:09.382 --> 20:10.383
Justice.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.254
You're well outside
your lane here.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.735
I was asked to step in.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.433
Why not just take it
to my DC legal?

20:17.477 --> 20:20.784
I did, but he won't blow
his nose without your okay,

20:20.828 --> 20:22.612
so here I am.

20:22.656 --> 20:25.093
Look, I've read the case file

20:25.136 --> 20:28.096
and some notes I had pulled up
from my detective's computer.

20:28.139 --> 20:31.926
It seems the eyewitness
changed her story,

20:31.969 --> 20:35.625
most likely due to six vodkas
on her bar bill.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.541
Ah. That'll do it.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.022
I am asking
the arresting detective

20:41.065 --> 20:44.286
to forward those notes
to the A.D.A.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.594
And I am confident
the case will be dropped.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.685
Thank you.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.645
You know, I was a little...

20:55.689 --> 20:57.256
surprised...

20:57.299 --> 21:01.172
that my daughter
put you up to this.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.827
And also surprised
that you ran with it.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.440
I'm taking the Fifth.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.616
Nope.

21:09.659 --> 21:13.533
Like I say, it
was a just cause.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.668
What about the first part?

21:19.713 --> 21:22.324
I really should
stay out of this.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.459
It's too late for that.

21:28.069 --> 21:32.291
I'm sure you and Erin have a
deep reservoir of trust built up

21:32.334 --> 21:33.814
over a lifetime.

21:33.857 --> 21:36.599
I thought so, too.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.775
Am I wrong?

21:41.604 --> 21:44.694
Why doesn't your family
retain a counsel?

21:44.738 --> 21:47.001
We keep our own counsel.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.568
Well...

21:48.611 --> 21:51.440
a lawyer who represents
himself has a fool

21:51.484 --> 21:54.269
for a client.No, not the same thing.

21:54.313 --> 21:59.143
I get the sense...

21:59.187 --> 22:02.408
that you and your
family think

22:02.451 --> 22:04.453
you can go to war
at the office

22:04.497 --> 22:06.673
without bringing
those battles home.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.457
We manage.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.241
Besides, what's the alternative?

22:10.285 --> 22:11.721
Robert Duvall in The Godfather?

22:11.765 --> 22:14.637
I know that the turf war

22:14.681 --> 22:16.639
between you and the D.A.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.641
has gotten nasty.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.817
I also know that

22:20.861 --> 22:24.125
your daughter--
and she is no shrinking violet--

22:24.168 --> 22:28.434
has lost her appetite for
duking it out with her father.

22:28.477 --> 22:29.870
With the PC.That is

22:29.913 --> 22:31.872
a distinction
withouta difference.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.787
And in this case,

22:33.830 --> 22:37.530
it was a fight she had
every right and duty to bring.

22:51.761 --> 22:52.632
Can I come in?

22:52.675 --> 22:54.982
Of course.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.810
Thing is,
I don't have an appointment.

22:56.853 --> 22:59.639
I wouldn't want to take
advantage of our relationship.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.076
I guess I deserved that.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.860
Billy said
the charges were dropped.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.427
Thank you.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.646
They were dropped
because he's innocent,

23:06.689 --> 23:08.778
not because
I put a finger on the scale.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.389
I know you'd never do that.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.738
Not even for you.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.653
And I hope that you know

23:13.696 --> 23:15.959
that I would never
ask for your help

23:16.003 --> 23:18.309
just because I like some guy.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.399
Well, I'm happy
to hear that.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.792
I introduced you to Billy
because he wanted help.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.403
Among other things.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.752
I'm sorry.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.058
Okay. I shouldn't have
gotten involved with Billy

23:28.102 --> 23:30.583
while you were going out
of your way to help him,

23:30.626 --> 23:33.455
but the real issue here is
you not being comfortable

23:33.499 --> 23:35.196
with me having a sex life.

23:35.239 --> 23:36.937
You're right, and I'm guessing

23:36.980 --> 23:39.679
you don't really want to
hear about my sex life.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.594
Ugh. No.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.814
I shouldn't have
showed up unannounced.

23:44.858 --> 23:47.861
It's okay. I really don't
want this part of my life

23:47.904 --> 23:49.471
to be some deep dark secret.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.952
Well, some secrets
are good to keep.

23:51.995 --> 23:55.738
Yeah, but I need to be able
to talk to you about this stuff.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.827
So maybe we can operate

23:57.871 --> 24:00.830
on a need-to-know,
less-is-more basis?

24:01.875 --> 24:03.790
Deal.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.444
Deal.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.066
Ten-minute warning on dinner.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.241
Thanks.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.851
Danny's gonna be here soon.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.766
Uh-huh.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.769
Maybe you guys should talk
before we sit down to dinner.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.771
She said, hopefully.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.991
Jamie, you guys love
and respect each other.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.383
Don't you think
it's time you make up?

24:32.427 --> 24:33.994
It's not like he stole
my baseball glove, Eddie.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.692
He screwed up at a crime scene,
my crime scene.

24:36.736 --> 24:37.911
Yeah, he followed his gut.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.347
That's what makes
him a great cop.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.391
You're taking his side?

24:40.435 --> 24:41.697
Of course not.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.788
He's your brother.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.964
Exactly.
I let him disobey a direct order

24:48.008 --> 24:49.531
because we got
the same last name?

24:49.575 --> 24:52.273
What kind of credibility
will I have with the next guy?

24:59.019 --> 25:00.977
Running late?

25:01.021 --> 25:03.806
Had a few things
to take care of.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.069
Wouldn't be that you're trying
to avoid Jamie, would it?

25:06.113 --> 25:08.028
So I guess you heard.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.117
Bad news travels fast
around here.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.727
Well, it is what it is.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.337
What are you gonna
do about it?

25:13.381 --> 25:16.384
I mean, got a hearing set in
the trial room for tomorrow.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.560
You're really gonna
let it go that far?

25:18.604 --> 25:20.344
I'mreally gonna let it
go that far?

25:20.388 --> 25:21.520
I didn't do anything, okay?

25:21.563 --> 25:23.260
I'm the victim here.
I did my job,

25:23.304 --> 25:25.306
and he came after
me for nothing.

25:25.349 --> 25:26.742
If this is gonna get settled,

25:26.786 --> 25:28.657
someone has
to make the first move.So why do I

25:28.701 --> 25:30.311
have to be the one
to make the first move?

25:30.354 --> 25:31.355
Because you're older.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.096
I'm older, and he outranks me.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.577
Okay, look, I get
what you're trying to do,

25:35.621 --> 25:38.232
and I appreciate it,
but don't do it.

25:40.974 --> 25:43.063
Will you pass the meat?

25:44.412 --> 25:45.805
Hello?

25:50.679 --> 25:52.072
Here you go.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.595
Thank you.You're welcome.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.554
Maybe you could teach
your fiancé some manners.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.207
Word "manners" is kind of
like "rules."

25:57.251 --> 25:58.382
It's not exactly
your strong suit.

26:01.255 --> 26:04.214
How is Officer Green holding up?

26:04.258 --> 26:06.390
Media's doing a real job on him.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.175
Why is it always
the cop's fault?

26:08.218 --> 26:10.612
Certain papers
playing to their base.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.266
Although sometimes,
a cop goes too far,

26:12.309 --> 26:13.441
and needs to be held
accountable.

26:13.484 --> 26:14.616
Not in his case.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.052
The findings were quick
and conclusive.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.576
DANNY:
And when a guy

26:17.619 --> 26:19.273
does nothing wrong and takes
a bad guy off the street,

26:19.316 --> 26:20.535
that should be reported, too.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.363
Two sides to every story.HENRY: I was glad

26:22.406 --> 26:25.061
to hear that the grand jury
didn't indict Officer Green.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.280
Yeah.DANNY:
That's 'cause they get

26:26.323 --> 26:27.411
that he was doing
his job, though.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.065
Some people don'tget that.

26:29.109 --> 26:30.545
You going somewhere with this?ERIN: All right, guys,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.373
this is not the time
or the place.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.549
Jamie, cool it.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.419
Thank you.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.160
You, too.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.601
If Officer Green did
the right thing...

26:42.644 --> 26:44.298
No "if."

26:44.341 --> 26:45.647
...it will come out.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.389
It's the time spent waiting
that's the killer.

26:50.304 --> 26:52.175
DANNY:
Guy does his job,

26:52.219 --> 26:53.263
he shouldn't pay
a price for it.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.743
Why don't you cut the crap,
Danny?

26:54.787 --> 26:56.658
You know, I wasn't even
talking to you. You must have

26:56.702 --> 26:57.659
a guilty conscience.

26:57.703 --> 26:58.791
This argument doesn't belong

26:58.834 --> 26:59.966
at this table.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.402
Maybe it does. Why don't

27:01.445 --> 27:03.360
you settle
this, Grandpa?I can't.

27:03.404 --> 27:04.710
Can't or won't?

27:04.753 --> 27:06.450
My sons are having
a disagreement,

27:06.494 --> 27:08.409
so they need to figure
it out like grown men.

27:08.452 --> 27:09.671
DANNY:
I tried.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.455
This one doesn't want
to listen to reason.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.370
I'll start listening to reason
when I start hearing some.We don't

27:13.414 --> 27:15.982
turn on each other in this
family. How's that for reason?

27:16.025 --> 27:17.897
That rule doesn't apply to you
out on the street?ERIN: Guys, that's enough.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.463
You better stop hiding behind
those stripes you're wearing.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.161
I'm not wearing 'em right now,
Danny.Great!

27:21.204 --> 27:22.684
Let's go outside and settle this
like we used to.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.468
Step outside.

27:24.512 --> 27:27.384
That's it!SEAN: Dad.

27:27.428 --> 27:32.085
You can't abide by the rules
of this table, get out.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.596
Got a heads-up
from the shield desk.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.686
Officer Green
showed up unannounced.

28:10.384 --> 28:11.733
And did he turn it in?

28:11.777 --> 28:13.996
Coincidentally,
they stepped away for a moment

28:14.040 --> 28:15.998
just as he got there.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.522
They made him wait.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.918
Bring him up
in my private elevator.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.225
I figured you would say that.
He's waiting outside.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.444
Thanks, Sid.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.446
Baker?

28:42.372 --> 28:44.374
Please have a seat.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.126
Thanks for coming up.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.867
Honored, sir.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.219
Look, I understand
why you want to quit,

29:03.263 --> 29:05.221
what you're going through.

29:05.265 --> 29:09.008
A lot of guys would be looking
for the exit.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.837
This seems like the right time.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.970
But... maybe

29:15.014 --> 29:17.190
you ought to wait
for the dust to settle

29:17.233 --> 29:19.801
before you make
this big a decision?

29:19.845 --> 29:21.237
I've already thought it through.
I loved being a cop,

29:21.281 --> 29:22.499
but that time is over now.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.937
We can pull you
off the street for a while,

29:24.980 --> 29:27.591
put you in
an administrative post.

29:27.635 --> 29:28.897
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.246
But in my mind,
I'm already gone.

29:30.290 --> 29:34.163
Well, what are you gonna do?

29:34.207 --> 29:35.730
Haven't really thought
about that.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.124
I mean, you can't collect
your pension and benefits yet.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.126
I'm aware.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.871
And how about...
your wife and kids?

29:45.914 --> 29:48.221
I can tell you, it...

29:48.264 --> 29:50.223
It's kind of a big deal

29:50.266 --> 29:53.400
when their cop
is no longer their cop.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.620
Oh, we live separately, so,

29:56.664 --> 29:59.319
it's not really a part
of their day-to-day anymore.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.889
Okay.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.895
And how about you?

30:09.938 --> 30:12.201
Turning in the shield

30:12.245 --> 30:16.727
under these circumstances...

30:16.771 --> 30:20.079
things can kind of snowball.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.081
Things?

30:22.124 --> 30:25.040
Your sense of control,
your sense of purpose.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.870
For some guys,

30:28.914 --> 30:32.569
it's kind of like
they lost all their keys.

30:32.613 --> 30:36.138
I'm pretty sure
there's a life for me

30:36.182 --> 30:38.749
after the NYPD,
all due respect.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.882
Oh, I'm certain there is.

30:40.926 --> 30:44.016
I just meant that, uh,
if you need to talk to someone,

30:44.059 --> 30:45.278
we have great resources.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.236
Yeah.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.064
You offered that already, sir.

30:51.066 --> 30:54.853
Yes. That's right, I did.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.898
I just want out.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.989
That's all.

31:01.033 --> 31:04.471
And I appreciate everything
that you've done for me,

31:04.514 --> 31:07.648
including whoever called down
to the fifth floor

31:07.691 --> 31:10.303
to keep me from turning this in.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.399
Thank you.

31:27.973 --> 31:31.280
Okay. All right,
I'll just stick with that.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.462
Can you guys give me a second?

31:43.814 --> 31:44.946
What are you doing here, Pop?

31:44.990 --> 31:46.469
Could ask you two
the same thing.

31:46.513 --> 31:49.516
Come on, Gramps. You know
this is between the two of us.

31:49.559 --> 31:50.821
The hell it is.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.911
You represent our family,

31:52.954 --> 31:54.564
on the job and off.

31:54.608 --> 31:57.741
And until today, you've never
done anything to disgrace it.

31:57.785 --> 31:58.786
JAMIE: Can't undo
what happened.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.440
Someone's got to solve it.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.398
Fine. You made

32:02.442 --> 32:03.747
the right call.Yeah.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.488
But you crossed the line
doing it.

32:05.532 --> 32:10.580
You toed the line, but you made
the wrong call writing it up.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.366
So where does that leave us?

32:13.409 --> 32:15.368
You're brothers.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.370
Act like it.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.467
Haven't seen him
that pissed off

32:27.510 --> 32:30.513
since I used his dress blues
to make a tent in the backyard.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.648
Think he's right?

32:34.691 --> 32:36.476
He usually is.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.394
Look, I called an audible,

32:41.437 --> 32:43.439
but I didn't mean
any disrespect.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.224
Sure felt like disrespect.

32:45.267 --> 32:46.790
Well, that's my
charming personality.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.580
Any event, I apologize,
for what it's worth.

32:53.623 --> 32:54.929
Well, I told myself

32:54.973 --> 32:56.800
that writing you up
was strictly professional,

32:56.844 --> 32:59.412
but I'm not sure if that's true.

32:59.455 --> 33:00.500
How's that?

33:00.543 --> 33:02.154
When we were young,

33:02.197 --> 33:04.721
you used to always ride me
about being the Boy Scout,

33:04.765 --> 33:07.463
following all
the rules.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.900
It was pretty annoying.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.513
Yeah, well...

33:13.556 --> 33:15.558
it's... who I am.

33:15.602 --> 33:16.951
What can I say?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.474
Hmm.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.563
On the job, too.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.001
I know you always
look down on that.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.915
No. You got that
backwards, kid.

33:24.959 --> 33:27.744
I don't look down
on it, at all.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.529
I mean, I wish I could...

33:29.572 --> 33:32.532
play it straight and be
as good a cop as you are.

33:32.575 --> 33:33.750
Come on.It's true.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.622
I'm just not made that way.

33:35.665 --> 33:38.364
Frankly, that's why
I'm not gonna go as far
on the job as you.

33:38.407 --> 33:39.539
It is what it is.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.410
First grade detective?
Not too shabby.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.021
Well...

33:44.674 --> 33:46.937
Look, I probably
don't say it enough,

33:46.981 --> 33:50.158
but I'm... very proud of you.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.553
Same.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.947
I'm gonna withdraw
my appeal.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.385
I'll rescind
the complaint.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.560
No.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.171
Honestly. Don't do that.
I deserved it.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.304
No.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.132
The moment you
took out that perp,

34:07.175 --> 34:09.438
the HNT leader leaned
into me and said,

34:09.482 --> 34:12.528
"How about the
stones on him?"

34:12.572 --> 34:14.530
Well, the moment
a rookie sergeant

34:14.574 --> 34:16.445
hangs a complaint
on a veteran detective,

34:16.489 --> 34:20.493
I say, "Hey, look
at the stones on him."

34:28.979 --> 34:29.937
What?

34:29.980 --> 34:31.591
Officer Green is holed up

34:31.634 --> 34:34.072
in his apartment in the Bronx
and threatening to kill himself.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.685
And no talking him out?

34:38.728 --> 34:40.295
Negotiators are trying.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.645
McKenzie on the scene?That's who's with him.

34:42.689 --> 34:44.691
But all he's getting back is
that Green wants to talk to you.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.519
And of course, we said no way.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.695
Of course you did.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.437
He was an Army brat
who became a cop,

34:51.480 --> 34:54.048
so his trust goes to his C.O.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.007
or the guys
in his particular foxhole.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.792
I am one of both.

34:58.835 --> 35:00.750
Get my detail.

35:00.794 --> 35:04.667
I know that you're trying
to help, but... you can't.

35:04.711 --> 35:08.236
No one can.
So please, just please...

35:08.280 --> 35:10.369
leave me the hell alone.

35:12.632 --> 35:16.201
I told you to
leave me alone!

35:16.244 --> 35:18.638
It's Frank Reagan,
Douglas.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.770
I am coming in.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.103
May I?

36:01.376 --> 36:03.117
Beautiful family.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.640
Yeah.

36:04.684 --> 36:05.946
We were.

36:05.989 --> 36:07.643
Stop that.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.560
You're living under
different roofs right now,

36:11.604 --> 36:14.563
but you're still a family.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.565
How long you been apart?

36:16.609 --> 36:18.698
Two months.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.396
My wife said that
I was married to the job.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.094
Best cops usually are.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.663
Officer Green...I'm not an officer

36:27.707 --> 36:29.535
anymore.You handed in

36:29.578 --> 36:32.712
your shield, but your paperwork
hasn't been processed yet,

36:32.755 --> 36:35.367
so you still answer to me.

36:35.410 --> 36:36.672
Understood?

36:39.806 --> 36:41.111
Understood?

36:41.155 --> 36:42.548
Yes, sir.

36:42.591 --> 36:46.639
If they hadn't opened up
on you and your partner,

36:46.682 --> 36:48.858
she would be alive today.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.382
Her death...

36:50.425 --> 36:52.558
is on them, not you.

36:52.601 --> 36:53.776
Copy?

36:54.647 --> 36:56.605
We could've backed off.

36:56.649 --> 36:58.912
That's not what we do.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.609
Is it?

37:02.524 --> 37:04.047
No, sir.

37:04.091 --> 37:07.442
My partner and I were returning
fire during a bank robbery

37:07.486 --> 37:09.270
in East Harlem.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.707
One of the bullets
from my service revolver

37:11.751 --> 37:15.755
hit a young woman
in the beauty shop next door.

37:15.798 --> 37:18.453
I watched her die on the scene.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.718
I tried to shake it.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.765
I mean, I didn't know her
from Adam.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.984
And then...

37:28.028 --> 37:30.726
it occurred to me:

37:30.770 --> 37:33.468
she was someone's daughter.

37:33.512 --> 37:36.254
Turns out
she was someone's sister...

37:36.297 --> 37:38.691
wife, mother.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.739
I tried real hard
to block that out.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.395
And...

37:47.439 --> 37:49.658
then...

37:49.702 --> 37:51.704
it occurred to me

37:51.747 --> 37:55.795
she was someone's coworker,
someone's loyal customer,

37:55.838 --> 38:00.278
someone's fellow churchgoer,
and on and on.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.938
Every little last role
she could've had in life.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.683
Then I got some help.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.602
You think you
could use some help?

38:32.614 --> 38:34.660
Trade you.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.949
I'm proud of you.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.215
You know, we're only supposed
to feed them once a week.

39:08.258 --> 39:10.826
Yeah, they're like a bunch
of stray cats-- one square meal,

39:10.870 --> 39:12.088
you can't get
rid of them.

39:12.132 --> 39:14.395
Well, the last one
didn't go so well, so...

39:14.439 --> 39:16.092
So certain parties
asked for a do-over.

39:17.006 --> 39:19.095
Release the Beast!

39:19.139 --> 39:21.750
What?The Beast.

39:21.794 --> 39:23.970
Wow!Oh, my goodness!

39:24.013 --> 39:25.928
The Roast Beast
from Anthony

39:25.972 --> 39:27.321
and Sons.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.193
Well, Jamie and I wanted to, uh,

39:30.237 --> 39:32.195
offer this gesture,
because, well...

39:32.239 --> 39:34.154
Mmm, french fries.we know we screwed up.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.982
That's an understatement.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.113
JAMIE:
We definitely

39:37.157 --> 39:38.985
let things get out of hand.You think?

39:39.028 --> 39:40.769
Well, we didn't mean
any disrespect to you

39:40.813 --> 39:43.816
or to anyone at this table,
and, uh, we're sorry.

39:43.859 --> 39:46.427
So just tell us
how to make it right.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.128
Well...

39:52.172 --> 39:55.393
the Roast Beast
is a pretty good start.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.875
You know, one thing is
kind of too bad, though.

39:59.919 --> 40:00.920
What's that?You know,

40:00.963 --> 40:02.704
it would have been
quite a fight.

40:02.748 --> 40:03.575
DANNY:
Yeah,

40:03.618 --> 40:04.706
it would have been.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.491
All 30 seconds of it.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.624
I would've carried you
for at least a minute
so you didn't feel bad.

40:09.668 --> 40:11.278
Nah, my money
was on Uncle Danny.

40:11.321 --> 40:12.671
He fights dirty.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.673
Really? He's a little
past his prime.

40:14.716 --> 40:17.545
Wow, you're one
to talk, Counselor.

40:17.589 --> 40:20.026
Oh, I think I could take
the both of you on.

40:20.069 --> 40:21.941
Probably could, and
at the same time, too.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.856
There you go.That I'd like to see.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.640
Now, thisis more like it.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.076
Hear, hear.Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.556
Grace.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.169
ALL:
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, Thy gifts,

40:33.213 --> 40:36.172
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

40:36.216 --> 40:38.261
through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

40:38.305 --> 40:42.135
All right, which one
has the most fries?

40:42.178 --> 40:43.745
This one?
