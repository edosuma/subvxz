00:37.203 --> 00:40.874
-Mr. Dwyer, how are you feeling now?
-Like an elephant is sitting on my chest.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.043
We're taking you to the catheterization
lab to open your blocked arteries.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.503
You've just had a heart attack.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.344
I thought I had died
and was talking to an angel.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.345
[doctor chuckles]

00:54.929 --> 00:56.181
You're very much alive.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.266
You are my doctor, right?

00:59.684 --> 01:00.518
One of them.

[machine beeps]

01:19.746 --> 01:20.663
[in Mandarin]
Well?

01:20.789 --> 01:23.541
American Business man, 45 years old...
maybe 90 minutes ago...

01:23.666 --> 01:24.709
Looks bad.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.795
Thank you.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.131
Hello.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.343
[in English]
Hey, I'm Dr. Ling. Can you talk?

01:34.636 --> 01:37.096
Hey! Wake up!

01:37.555 --> 01:38.473
[machine flatlines]

We're losing him. Charge the paddles.

Clear.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.068
Clear.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.904
Clear.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.783
Clear.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.285

You know, my wife won't
let my boy play football.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.909
I mean, he's damn near eight years old,
he ain't a goddamn baby.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.371
What? You on her side?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.498
I'm talkin' football, man.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.750
Boys gotta play football.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.004
Nowadays, kids can't do anything
without runnin' around with a helmet on

04:56.129 --> 04:57.630
and a bottle of hand sanitizer.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.841
Shit, it's always something.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.884
What you got? Ah, Shit.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.098
I'm sorry.

Jesus!

Thank you.

The rest of them?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.019
[laughing] You're gonna love this.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.230
Uh, Worm?

[signal beeping]

07:54.056 --> 07:54.932
What are you doin'?

07:55.391 --> 07:57.435
Come on, man.
We can all make it out of this OK.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.394
Come on, man!

08:02.356 --> 08:03.316
No!

08:13.201 --> 08:14.994
That's how you do it.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.212
Get us outta here.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.006
[sighs]

08:29.383 --> 08:30.510
What about him?

08:31.802 --> 08:32.970
Don't worry about him.

08:34.096 --> 08:34.972
Hey, no.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.099
Now, I did what you wanted.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.229
You said I'd see my family again
if I did what you wanted.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.481
Your family's gonna be fine, Gary.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.150
And you'll see them again.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.444
In hell.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.242
[choking and gasping]

08:56.118 --> 08:59.163
You'd rather him run to the police
and rat us out in 10 minutes?

08:59.330 --> 09:02.708
I'd rather you don't make promises
unless you intend to keep them. Karma.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.877
Karma.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.755
With all due respect, Mr. Novak,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.424
I know you're a big shot in Mexico.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.468
But until you get there,

09:13.678 --> 09:16.055
I'm gonna ask you
to please show the proper respect

09:16.180 --> 09:19.183
to the people who just saved you
from 25 to life.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.769
Look, I thank you for all your help

09:21.894 --> 09:24.397
but your crew answers to you
and you answer to me.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.356
Respect that.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.858
I respect your money.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.196
Stubborn little fucker.
Take care of that, Worm.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.538
[groans]

09:47.044 --> 09:49.589
In the van.
Let's go, your highness, get in the van.

[engine stalling]

09:53.301 --> 09:55.970
No, no, no, no, no! Come on, man!

09:57.138 --> 09:58.889
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:08.357 --> 10:10.234
You gotta be kidding me.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.029
-Karma, Jack.
-Goddamn it.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.031
All right, calm down.
Here's what we're gonna do.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.284
I'm gonna call Charlie
and have him send us another van.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.248
-What's wrong?
-[sighs] No signal.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.084
Oh, great, what do we do now?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.004
[sighs]

10:31.464 --> 10:33.341
We get off the road and we take a hike.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.052
Worm, get rid of it.

11:28.979 --> 11:33.150
[Patrick] Mike is so kind to invite us
here for the weekend.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.487
That's for sure! It's such a nice place.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.451
I'm glad you like it.

11:43.994 --> 11:44.829
Uh...

11:46.539 --> 11:47.456
Honey...

11:48.874 --> 11:55.756
He invited me to go hunt with him.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.050
-Hunt?
-Mm-hmm.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.177
You?

12:01.929 --> 12:03.222
Get some fresh air.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.057
You should go.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.144
All right.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.105
See you later.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.192
Be careful!

12:19.905 --> 12:23.075
Oh, man,
your mother is beggin' for grandkids.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.454
Nuh-uh.
We're still in the honeymoon phase.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.040
Come on, you guys have been married
for four years, right?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.292
Actually, two.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.585
Oh!

12:33.669 --> 12:36.881
You sound just like Laura.
Her clock is ticking.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.467
Shh!

12:43.762 --> 12:45.139
Look, right there.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.625
Sorry, my friend.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.058
Ah!

13:29.350 --> 13:30.184
Here we go.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.103
Yeah.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.397
Oh! Hey...

13:36.065 --> 13:36.899
Look at that.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.401
Now that is a nice shot. Uh?

13:39.818 --> 13:40.653
[sighs]

13:46.575 --> 13:49.703
Oh, no, listen, man,
it was either him or us.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.205
[chuckles]

13:51.747 --> 13:52.581
Woah!

13:53.457 --> 13:54.375
[squeals]

13:56.252 --> 13:57.753
[laughing]

13:58.379 --> 14:00.256
What the fuck was that, right?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.510
Straight through the heart.
It actually plugged up the wound.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.973
As long as whatever goes in,
doesn't come out.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.934
It could've lived a while longer.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.065
All right. Let's grab a leg.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.214
Hey, guys.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.425
How was it...

14:45.175 --> 14:46.010
Hey.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.930
Laura, are you OK with seeing this?

14:50.598 --> 14:52.725
This would be a slow day in the ER.

14:58.105 --> 15:02.568
Well, you know if you wanna grill it,
you gotta kill it, right?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.281
[Nick] Jesus, it's endless.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.034
This was supposed to be
a quick score, man.

15:10.159 --> 15:10.993
Shut up.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.954
You OK, baby?

15:15.664 --> 15:18.459
He's excited about Mexico
and those young seÃ±oritas.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.295
Or are you just happy to be outside?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.256
Must have been rough in there, six years.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.342
Figured, with all that money,

15:26.467 --> 15:29.345
would've had a smart-ass lawyer
who would've gotten you out.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.557
Wait, I forgot, didn't wanna cop a plea.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.351
Too much integrity.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.270
[chuckles] Integrity.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.359
[in Mandarin] Honey?

17:08.777 --> 17:12.196
Still showering?
Hurry up. I'll wait for you downstairs.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.615
[door slams shut]

17:26.837 --> 17:27.671
Huh!

17:28.672 --> 17:29.840
Not bad.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.058
[in English] Happy weekend.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.743
[phone beeps]

18:13.801 --> 18:14.635
[exhales]

18:34.571 --> 18:36.365
Haven't asked me about karma history.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.701
We've been doing really good.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.998
I thought we might be pals by now, Vic.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.225
Let's go make friends.

19:18.031 --> 19:21.827
[chuckling] I know you've explained
this to me a thousand times,

19:21.952 --> 19:24.329
but what the hell is a hedge fund?

19:25.664 --> 19:26.498
OK.

19:27.124 --> 19:33.338
Basically, it's a bunch of investors
who make bets with other people's money.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.844
So, you're the kind of guy who sees
Wolf of Wall Street as a hero's journey.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.598
-Oh, man, come on, here we go.
-All right. All right.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.934
I'm gonna spare you
with my liberal browbeating this time.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.227
Um...

19:47.769 --> 19:49.730
What is the most you've lost in one day?

19:49.938 --> 19:50.939
Ooh...

19:52.858 --> 19:53.984
Two point eight million.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.195
Bad day.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.446
Wow!

19:57.905 --> 19:59.573
-Could you imagine?
-No.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.325
I couldn't do it.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.870
Yeah, but if you've got the stones
to stare down that kind of day,

20:05.120 --> 20:06.705
the rewards are incredible.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.790
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.711
Do you really love being a doctor?

20:13.337 --> 20:16.256
The grinding hours,
the malpractice insurance,

20:16.632 --> 20:19.927
smug business men who think
you're overpaid for saving their lives,

20:20.761 --> 20:21.762
Was I overpaid?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.806
Well, you know, if I remember correctly,
you weren't paid at all.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.769
You wouldn't take my money.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.564
But I took your friendship.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.650
You saved my life.

20:36.151 --> 20:36.985
Thank you.

20:37.694 --> 20:38.737
You're welcome.

20:42.991 --> 20:47.120
And look at my life now, right?
I mean, please, this place is heaven.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.331
It is.

20:49.915 --> 20:54.127
But I really believe we're here
to help others.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.754
Keep that idealism.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.841
I appreciate you guys
coming here this weekend.

21:00.550 --> 21:04.054
I mean, all of this really means nothing
without your friends, right?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.556
You won't accept anything.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.727
But please allow me to gift something
to your wife, OK? Just...

21:10.852 --> 21:11.853
Mike...

21:13.397 --> 21:15.774
-There you go. For you.
-[Patrick] Wow!

21:16.400 --> 21:17.401
Wow!

21:20.153 --> 21:22.364
This is... beautiful.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.909
-Thank you, I made it myself.
-Beautiful. Really.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.161
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.957
To my favorite idealists.

21:33.583 --> 21:37.045
May God bless you and your beautiful wife.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.880
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.549
Cheers.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.469
[banging on door]

21:45.846 --> 21:48.015
Well, that must be
a noise complaint, you know.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.017
-You guys gotta keep it down, all right.
-[Patrick chuckling]

21:54.896 --> 21:56.356
We don't want any.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.942
Not selling any.

21:59.109 --> 21:59.985
Ah!

22:00.110 --> 22:01.486
So sorry to disturb you.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.697
See, hell of a place for a breakdown,

22:03.822 --> 22:05.157
I've been walking
for the last couple of hours

22:05.282 --> 22:06.366
trying to find a phone.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.870
-Just take a minute.
-You don't have a cellphone?

22:10.829 --> 22:12.581
No. Uh-huh. Old-fashioned guy.

22:13.790 --> 22:17.210
Oh. Well,
where did you say you were going?

22:17.669 --> 22:21.173
I didn't. Florida. Vacation

22:21.548 --> 22:22.966
Ah. Where are you from?

22:23.759 --> 22:25.093
Up north. Yankee.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.179
Yankee.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.725
Well, you know, our service here
is in and out,

22:31.850 --> 22:35.103
but they have call boxes
up and down the highway.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.690
Yeah, I tried a few of those. No luck.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.735
They do make awfully good bird nests,
though.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.865
I waited around to see
if anybody was gonna come by,

22:46.990 --> 22:49.951
after about an hour,
a truck driver showed up,

22:50.077 --> 22:51.119
rode right on by.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.329
Oh...

22:53.622 --> 22:56.166
I guess it's every man for himself
out here, isn't it?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.167
[Mike] Mm-hmm.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.460
Yeah.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.130
Well, all right, look, I...

23:03.006 --> 23:05.425
I won't cause any trouble,
so don't worry about it.

23:06.593 --> 23:09.346
I'm sure I'll find another place
a few miles down the road.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.847
-Just keep on walking.
-OK.

23:10.972 --> 23:11.807
Mike.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.266
-Yeah?
-Everything OK?

23:17.771 --> 23:20.816
Yeah, you know what? I'm sorry.
You can use my phone. Come on in.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.693
Ah, that's great. Thank you.
Really appreciate this.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.741
Oh, you don't mind my pals come in
and take a load off, do you?

23:29.866 --> 23:31.243
They've been walking for quite while.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.577
Uh...

23:33.286 --> 23:34.496
-Hi.
-Well...

23:34.830 --> 23:35.956
-Oh, my shit.
-[whistles]

23:44.965 --> 23:48.051
-I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
-It's Mike.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.345
Mike Dwyer.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.888
Mike. Jack.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.600
Yep. Jack.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.020
Right. You're not from around here,
are you?

23:59.646 --> 24:00.730
[chuckling]

24:02.607 --> 24:03.775
We've come from China.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.157
Who are you? What's your name?

24:12.284 --> 24:13.493
I'm gonna get you a phone.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.121
Name?

24:17.330 --> 24:18.165
Name?

24:25.046 --> 24:25.922
What's your name?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.634
Laura.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.388
My wife.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.062
Enchanted.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.943
[humming]

24:48.612 --> 24:51.239
-He likes her.
-[Gina] Lucky girl.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.203
-There's no car, Jack.
-What?

24:57.412 --> 24:58.580
Nothin', man.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.376
Where's your ride, Mike?

25:07.088 --> 25:08.340
We don't have a car, Jack.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.053
My assistant dropped us off
for the weekend.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.430
A girl by the name of Cindy.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.642
She'll be pickin' us up tomorrow morning
at 10:00 a.m.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.061
And she's very precise.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.445
[Jack] Hey, Charlie.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.573
You're supposed to answer when I call you.
I don't like leaving messages.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.991
We got a change of plans.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.744
I need you to come get us.
Call me back ASAP.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.794
Hey, excuse me,
can I get you guys something?

25:47.087 --> 25:47.921
Got any cigarettes?

25:48.588 --> 25:51.007
No, no. I don't smoke cigarettes.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.344
What about these?

25:56.221 --> 26:00.058
You know my...
My father got these for me as a gift.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.602
So I'm kinda saving them
for a special occasion.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.042
Gifts are meant to be shared.

26:28.211 --> 26:31.381
[whistling]

26:33.758 --> 26:35.719
Not bad at all.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.762
Not bad at all.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.604
I don't scare you, do I?

26:49.816 --> 26:51.359
I don't scare easily.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.403
I'm a doctor.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.200
It's just, the mountain air,

26:59.326 --> 27:02.329
it's bringing out the animal in me.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.586
[phone ringing]

27:19.804 --> 27:20.764
Hello, Charlie?

27:21.431 --> 27:22.265
Yeah.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.559
Yeah, we had a little snafu.

27:25.518 --> 27:28.146
Yeah, we'll have to go
with a contingency plan.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.482
Yep.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.692
Yeah.

27:33.943 --> 27:34.778
Yeah.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.865
All right. Send out the other van.

27:40.408 --> 27:41.826
Yeah, hold on.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.079
Mike?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.373
Hey, where are we at?

27:47.999 --> 27:50.001
Mile marker 201.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.295
Tell them to take the Conyers.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.422
Cut off is a little tricky.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.133
You catch that? Mile marker 201.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.637
Yeah. Said it gets
a little hinky there, so...

28:03.348 --> 28:04.307
A couple hours?

28:06.226 --> 28:07.227
Come on, man.

28:11.689 --> 28:12.524
Yeah.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.695
Yeah. I'm sure we'll find something to do.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.370
Hey, come to think about it,

28:26.371 --> 28:27.789
either of you guys got a cellphone
I could borrow.

28:28.706 --> 28:29.916
I gotta text my old lady.

28:30.625 --> 28:31.501
She worries.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.464
Come on, it's important.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.315
Mine doesn't work here in the US.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.034
Well, let's hope nobody important
tries to get a hold of you then.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.078
Let's keep looking for that car.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.081
There's no car, man.

29:12.417 --> 29:16.337
So, which one of you
is the money behind this place?

29:19.257 --> 29:22.385
My bet is on the little Chinaman.

29:22.802 --> 29:25.513
No? Oh, it's the big one.

29:26.431 --> 29:29.392
Damn, he's got the size and the cash.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.813
You're just the shit that's left over.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.025
Like the movie.

29:38.151 --> 29:38.985
-Twins!
-Twins!

29:42.238 --> 29:43.490
You're Danny DeVito.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.241
[both continue laughing]

29:54.459 --> 29:56.336
-Whoops.
-You klutz.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.839
Hey, you know what? Don't worry about it.

30:00.590 --> 30:01.549
I'll take care of it.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.220
Mike, it's fine. We can handle it.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.513
Look, it's all right, man.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.598
I'm just gonna go get a broom
from the garage, OK?

30:08.848 --> 30:09.891
No, no. Don't.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.645
I apologize for my associates.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.233
She'll be out of here soon.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.322
Good news. Our ride's on the way.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.283
In just a few short hours,
it'll be like we were never here.

30:27.951 --> 30:28.785
I know that's not ideal

30:28.952 --> 30:31.663
but we can compensate you
with our good company.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.542
I'm sorry
but that's not going to work for us.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.126
So you made you call?

30:38.419 --> 30:40.129
Please, leave.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.382
Patrick.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.177
It's gonna be a couple of hours.

30:47.345 --> 30:51.266
Now, we could spend that time
standing by that empty highway

30:51.391 --> 30:55.436
that seems to be about a mile
from your long and winding road

30:55.562 --> 31:00.775
or we could spend it here
with a bottle of wine and a pretty lady.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.070
Some good old-fashioned conversation.

31:05.113 --> 31:05.947
How's that sound?

31:06.447 --> 31:07.407
That's all you want?

31:09.033 --> 31:10.034
And then you will leave?

31:11.911 --> 31:12.996
Scout's honor.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.790
We don't really have a choice,
do we, Jack?

31:16.624 --> 31:18.418
Well, you always have a choice, Mikey.

31:18.626 --> 31:21.129
OK, if we're reasonable,

31:22.130 --> 31:23.590
then you will be reasonable.

31:24.799 --> 31:27.677
I am an exceedingly reasonable man.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.974
[Mike] So, let me get this straight.

31:33.474 --> 31:37.145
In a few hours, you'll leave
and go on your vacation

31:37.270 --> 31:39.981
because all of you
are on vacation together, right?

31:40.189 --> 31:42.233
Vacation's better with friends.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.196
[gun fires]

31:48.740 --> 31:49.574
[Laura screams]

31:49.741 --> 31:50.575
Waste her, Jack!

31:52.952 --> 31:54.746
-Fuckin' A.
-Don't move!

31:55.371 --> 31:56.748
Don't fucking move!

32:00.376 --> 32:02.170
Now, get the fuck out of my...

32:10.345 --> 32:14.432
Christ, Worm. Does it always have to be
a headshot with you?

32:14.682 --> 32:16.643
This isn't going well, Jack. [groans]

32:18.227 --> 32:19.062
All right.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.941
Keith, Nick, take care of him.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.074
It's your fault, you know.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.285
I wanted to have a nice, quiet evening.

32:35.244 --> 32:39.040
Now, from the time we got in here,
I knew you would be trouble.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.002
You couldn't just relax
and go with the flow.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.672
You had to be a pain in the ass.

32:46.381 --> 32:49.050
Sassy broad like you
needs to be put in her place.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.016
[laughing]

32:57.308 --> 32:58.142
Looky. Looky.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.397
You see this?

33:04.399 --> 33:05.274
You did this.

33:07.694 --> 33:08.945
It's gonna be OK.

33:29.716 --> 33:30.633
Bring me that bitch.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.093
[Laura grunting]

33:38.850 --> 33:41.019
Look at that. You see that?

33:41.894 --> 33:43.312
I want you to remember that.

33:48.484 --> 33:51.487
Jack! Can't stop the bleeding!

34:00.204 --> 34:03.041
You said you were a doctor, right?
You do ER? Trauma?

34:03.166 --> 34:04.000
Hey, hey.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.169
-[gasping]
-Stay with me, pretty girl.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.047
I know this sucks...

34:10.922 --> 34:12.425
but you see that guy over there?

34:15.136 --> 34:17.472
He didn't have anything to do
with what went down.

34:17.722 --> 34:21.559
Now, technically speaking,
you were the one who shot him.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.562
I'm no doctor, but I know
there's an oath that says do no harm.

34:24.687 --> 34:27.440
And I'd say a bullet to a man's thigh
constitutes harm.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.609
So don't help him on my account,

34:30.025 --> 34:31.360
you can hate my guts,

34:32.110 --> 34:34.530
but you help him
because it's the right thing to do.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.657
[panting]

34:38.826 --> 34:39.869
And if he dies,

34:41.079 --> 34:41.996
you die.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.602
I'm gonna need some alcohol, gauze

35:06.604 --> 35:07.897
and things to stitch with.

35:12.735 --> 35:13.861
Well, all right, then.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.406
We might just salvage this day after all.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.911
Keith, drag Mr. Patrick to the garage.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.583
And the rest of you guys,
calm the fuck down.

36:13.671 --> 36:14.797
[door closes]

36:23.764 --> 36:25.600
[groans] Gross.

36:26.684 --> 36:28.186
[thunder rumbling]

36:31.022 --> 36:32.440
[Keith grunting]

37:06.557 --> 37:08.184
[rain pattering]

37:33.793 --> 37:34.835
Sorry, bro.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.106
[unzips pouch]

38:11.372 --> 38:12.331
[sighs]

38:35.771 --> 38:36.772
[utensils clinking]

39:33.245 --> 39:34.205
[sighs]

40:29.718 --> 40:30.553
Hey.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.265
Hey.

40:36.809 --> 40:37.768
Are you in there?

40:50.364 --> 40:51.240
Oh...

40:53.367 --> 40:54.493
There you are.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.996
Oh, fuck!

41:29.028 --> 41:30.321
[indistinct]

41:47.546 --> 41:49.256
[thunder rumbling]

42:07.107 --> 42:08.609
[Victor sighing]

42:10.986 --> 42:11.946
Thank you for this.

42:15.741 --> 42:17.201
Thank you for your steady hand.

42:23.582 --> 42:25.793
Was Patrick your... [gasps in pain]

42:26.252 --> 42:27.920
Don't you dare say his name.

42:29.129 --> 42:30.422
[gasping and sighing]

42:33.592 --> 42:34.510
These people...

42:38.013 --> 42:39.098
They are not my people.

42:40.015 --> 42:44.353
In Mexico, I would have been able
to handle this differently, but here I...

42:45.813 --> 42:46.939
My influence...

42:49.316 --> 42:50.401
only extends so far.

42:52.486 --> 42:56.448
Other... resources had to be employed.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.747
All of this happened...

43:07.001 --> 43:08.085
because of you.

43:32.901 --> 43:33.736
[bottles rattling]

43:38.532 --> 43:39.658
[machine beeps]

44:34.880 --> 44:36.256
There's nothin' online.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.551
That rock quarry's 100 feet deep.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.013
By the time they find that bus,
we'll be balls deep in margaritas.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.601
Charlie's gonna be here in an hour.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.149
You know, a little fucking gratitude
would go a long way.

44:55.150 --> 44:58.695
My gratefulness is endless.
My patience is not.

45:04.952 --> 45:06.120
You're no better than me.

45:11.708 --> 45:12.876
You think you are.

45:14.169 --> 45:16.171
But we're both killers.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.395
You have no appreciation
for this life, Jack.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.106
And you never have.

45:36.608 --> 45:37.609
Don't lecture me.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.657
Do you believe in God?

45:44.783 --> 45:45.742
[Jack sighs]

45:47.911 --> 45:48.829
Do you?

45:53.917 --> 45:54.751
No.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.047
But I want to.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.602
[bird squalling]

47:55.497 --> 47:56.456
[crow caws]

48:21.106 --> 48:23.942
Hey, they got some vinyl.
Anybody wanna listen to some music?

49:15.535 --> 49:17.079
[garage door opens]

49:17.621 --> 49:19.081
Pryor, somebody's home.

49:29.758 --> 49:31.218
[machine beeping rapidly]

49:34.721 --> 49:36.264
Take care of that fuckin' noise.

50:06.336 --> 50:07.170
[machine beeping rapidly]

50:07.379 --> 50:09.131
Keith better not be fuckin' with us.

50:11.091 --> 50:13.218
-Keith!
-Seriously?

50:30.736 --> 50:32.028
At least, he found a sheet.

50:32.821 --> 50:34.740
Look, he's probably strung out
in the woods somewhere.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.742
Why don't you let me make a call?
I got family here.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.160
[Jack] We're sticking to the plan.

50:39.327 --> 50:41.079
That's why it's called the plan.

50:42.789 --> 50:43.915
Charlie's on his way.

50:51.298 --> 50:52.466

[phone beeps]

51:13.737 --> 51:15.071
Everything OK?

51:16.698 --> 51:18.700
-Yeah, it's OK.
-Cool.

51:20.118 --> 51:22.078
You mind if we take a five-minute break?

51:24.206 --> 51:25.290
Duty calls, guys.

51:28.251 --> 51:29.878
Some people got no class.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.272
[both giggling]

51:56.530 --> 51:57.739
[speaks Spanish]

51:57.864 --> 51:59.115
Speak Spanish to me.

51:59.282 --> 52:00.575
[speaks Spanish] [laughs]

[Gina laughing]

52:48.206 --> 52:49.291
Talk to me.

52:49.416 --> 52:50.375
-Si.
-Si?

52:50.542 --> 52:51.501
-Si...
-Si.

52:52.419 --> 52:53.295
You gonna ride me?

52:53.962 --> 52:57.799
Gonna show you what a real cowboy can do.
Yeah? Yeah.

53:00.468 --> 53:01.428
[Gina] Fuck!

Ah, mami, yes mami!

[continues speaking Spanish]

53:31.374 --> 53:33.084
Hey!

53:33.501 --> 53:35.337
Nope! Not there!

53:35.462 --> 53:37.047
It is not your birthday.

53:37.631 --> 53:38.924
Goddamn it.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.887
Why do I have to go through this
every single goddamn time with you?

53:44.012 --> 53:45.889
Why do you have to be such a prude?

53:47.515 --> 53:51.186
Why do you have to be...
You're all talk. You're all talk!

53:51.311 --> 53:52.145
You're a pig.

53:56.274 --> 53:59.110
Gina? Gina.

54:00.445 --> 54:01.446
Gina, open up.

54:03.239 --> 54:06.576
Gina, don't you fuckin'
leave me like this.

54:07.953 --> 54:08.787
Gina!

54:12.040 --> 54:14.084
Fine. Go fuck yourself!

54:14.709 --> 54:17.921
I will go fuck myself! Fuck you.

54:18.588 --> 54:19.798
[Nick] I left my clothes!

55:17.772 --> 55:19.065
[water running]

56:21.336 --> 56:25.298
I'm sorry, I just want to save my wife.

56:26.925 --> 56:29.344
Please. Help me.

56:31.221 --> 56:32.931
You're a woman.

56:33.598 --> 56:37.477
Can you imagine what my wife
is going through right now?

56:39.896 --> 56:41.189
What they would do to her?

56:44.526 --> 56:45.401
It's OK.

56:47.612 --> 56:48.696
I'll make this fast.

56:55.078 --> 56:58.873
So, I'm a woman?
You think that makes me soft?

57:00.041 --> 57:01.292
You think I'll just do your bidding?

57:02.794 --> 57:05.713
Like every other piece-of-shit man
on this planet?

57:06.673 --> 57:08.258
What do you think now, you little maggot?

57:24.858 --> 57:27.485
Gina, listen, it's me. I'm comin' in.

57:31.322 --> 57:32.615
Oh, so, it's like that now?

57:33.074 --> 57:36.035
You won't even talk to me,
when I'm trying to say I'm sorry?

57:39.038 --> 57:42.459
Listen, I... I know I'm fucking up.

57:43.001 --> 57:45.462
I just can't handle
what you do to me sometimes.

57:46.171 --> 57:49.424
You know? You're equal parts guilty
about this shit.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.385
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57:52.677 --> 57:55.555
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I...
I don't mean to deflect the blame here.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.514
I'm just...

57:58.349 --> 57:59.684
Just give me something.

58:02.228 --> 58:03.521
A little something, maybe?

58:05.064 --> 58:06.191
Let me hear your voice.

58:08.943 --> 58:09.861
[banging on door]

58:10.236 --> 58:14.282
Woman, you better say something to me
or I'm gonna knock this door down.

58:14.407 --> 58:16.326
I won't have you disrespect me like this.

58:18.036 --> 58:19.329
Well, that's it, I'm comin' in.

58:35.303 --> 58:37.347
You know just how to hurt me,
you know that?

58:51.903 --> 58:53.279
[footsteps descending]

58:56.491 --> 58:59.577
Nope. I'm done with this bitch.
I mean it this time.

59:00.119 --> 59:01.746
I'm fucking done with her!

59:02.413 --> 59:03.456
What am I doing wrong?

59:04.958 --> 59:06.918
I treat her nice. I buy her shit.

59:08.878 --> 59:10.046
What? That's not enough?

59:11.339 --> 59:12.382
Answer me!

59:14.842 --> 59:17.387
You're just like her.
You're just like her.

59:31.401 --> 59:32.777
[in Spanish] We're going to hell, Worm.

59:33.611 --> 59:34.612
[in English] You and me.

59:35.655 --> 59:37.699
It's a price to pay
for all the shit we do.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:10.648
I, I wasn't gonna kill her.
I just, just wanted to scare her.

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:12.984
I just wanted to scare you.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:18.823
[machine beeps]

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:36.174
Sorry.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.596
Hey, don't be sad.

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:08.683
He's in a better place now.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:10.852
He's in the garage.

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.576
Can I get a drink please?

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:29.871
Woah!

01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:31.706
Look who's comin' around.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:44.969
To bitches.

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:46.721
Gotta love 'em.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.016
To Patrick.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.061
Who was just like you.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:03:00.568
Always wondered if I loved him enough.
I do. I did.

01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:04.447
I should have said it more often, I think.

01:03:06.407 --> 01:03:07.408
To my husband.

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:11.829
Who never hurt anybody in his life.

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:16.375
Who's nothing but a good, sincere man.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:17.835
Jesus, lady, are we gonna drink or what?

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:21.631
I just want to say I love him
and miss him very much.

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:22.757
Cheers.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:34.352
You want another drink?

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:36.771
No.

01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:38.231
-No.
-Really?

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.482
I'm OK. Yeah.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.235
-Are you sure.
-Yes, I'm OK.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.363
I mean, you just seemed
really interested in the bottle.

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:48.115
Doesn't she seem interested
in the bottle, Worm?

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:54.497
Let me... Let me try to figure out
what you're interested in.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:03:59.502
Mmmm.

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:03.089
Is it perhaps...

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:06.175
this?

01:04:07.468 --> 01:04:09.720
No. No. No.

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:11.973
If you want it that much,
here you fucking go.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.183
-No, no!
-No, don't "hey" me!

01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:16.811
This bitch is trying to get us drunk
to fucking shoot us!

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.981
-No, I wasn't. I swear.
-You think I'm stupid?

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:23.276
The old man is fine.
She already stitched him up.

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:25.945
Let's just fucking take care of her
right now.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.033
I'm distraught.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.201
[wailing]

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.121
-I don't know what do.
-[Nick] What the fuck!

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.873
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:04:37.498 --> 01:04:38.916
I just wanna live.

01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:43.087
I just wanna live. I just wanna survive.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.797
Man. Get, get off of me.

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:51.762
Yeah, whatever.

01:04:58.936 --> 01:04:59.896
[Nick clears throat]

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.191
Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai.

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.111
Think you've had enough.

01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:10.281
Yeah. You're probably right.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.702
But it's been a long fucking day.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.329
[pours a drink]

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.126
[clears throat] Well, that burns.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:26.881
Relax, Worm. You ain't my mom.

01:05:30.968 --> 01:05:32.136
[grunts, clears throat]

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:36.891
Now, my mom...

01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:41.604
That was one tough as nails ball-buster.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.023
God rest her soul.

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:50.947
[clears throat]

01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:54.325
Well, this... This stuff repeats in you.

01:05:57.828 --> 01:05:59.538
Just need a little water.

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:09.131
[groans]

01:06:11.258 --> 01:06:12.093
The fuck?

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:22.311
What the hell happened?

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:26.899
What's wrong with him?

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:29.986
He was drinkin' too much, he...

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:45.376
He's dead.

01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:04.729
This ain't whiskey.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:28.461
[rain splattering]

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:31.589
Where's everybody else?

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:57.156
Would you do me the favor
of keeping an eye on her.

01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:55.256
[water running]

01:09:39.383 --> 01:09:41.468
What happened here? I know you know.

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:44.638
I don't know.

01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:47.057
He can't still be...

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:50.227
Is Patrick behind this?

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:56.775
Please let me go.
He's dying and I could save him.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.030
This is your only chance to help us.

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:02.531
Yeah.

01:10:04.658 --> 01:10:05.618
I'm sorry.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.121
I know I've caused you
a great deal of pain...

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.124
but I've got a family too.

01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:14.543
I can't risk it.

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:16.795
Sorry.

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.350
You're not sorry.

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:32.686
You're worse than them.

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:49.286
Gina?

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:52.539
The fuck is goin' on?

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.628
You find that little son of a bitch.

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:03.133
Think your pussy husband's
gonna be able to save you?

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.427
Seems like he's doing
a pretty good job so far.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.179
You little bitch.

01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:12.851
I'm gonna take you down to Mexico
and sell your skinny ass to mis amigos.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.981
Those boys down there,
they have a real case of yellow fever.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:25.364
You know what they call rich bitches
like you down there?

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.451
Puta.

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:32.204
Don't... blame her.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.166
You did this. All of this.
She's paid enough of for one day.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:37.751
I say when it's enough.

01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:26.860
[phone buzzes]

01:13:35.702 --> 01:13:36.537
[Worm] I lost 'em.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.705
Well, he couldn't have gotten far.

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:43.710
Put me on speaker.

01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:53.512
Patrick.

01:13:56.306 --> 01:13:57.766
Oh, Patrick.

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:00.227
Patrick.

01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:06.108
What are we gonna do now?

01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:09.570
It was so simple before.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.655
And now look at us.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.324
Not that I can blame you.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:17.035
You seem like a nice guy.

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.288
I'm gonna make you a deal.

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:21.582
You come in now,

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.211
your wife doesn't have
to endure any more of this.

01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:30.090
Enough.

01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:32.634
[Laura protesting]

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:34.595
That's enough, Jack.

01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:35.929
Shut up.

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.145
Patrick, don't be stupid.

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:44.813
It's over.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.275
[bone cracks]

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.202
If I didn't still need you,
I'd kill you right now.

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:02.247
If I didn't need to get paid,
I'd kill you right back.

01:16:50.188 --> 01:16:51.106
