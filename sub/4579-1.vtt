01:31.500 --> 01:33.024
You've heard of the tunnel.

01:36.605 --> 01:40.041
The one we all go through
sooner or later.

01:41.843 --> 01:44.437
At the end, there's a door.

01:47.549 --> 01:51.246
And waiting for you on
the other side of that door...

01:51.319 --> 01:54.015
is either heaven...

01:54.122 --> 01:56.113
or hell.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.256
This is that door.

02:54.616 --> 02:56.447
Why is this patient
in lockdown?

02:56.518 --> 02:58.247
They didn't tell you
about Laurie Strode?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.446
No.

02:59.521 --> 03:02.922
You must have heard of her.
Sister of Michael Myers?

03:02.991 --> 03:05.221
Michael Myers,
the serial killer?

03:05.293 --> 03:08.057
Well, you'll hear
all the gossip soon enough.

03:08.129 --> 03:09.153
For now, let's just get...

03:09.197 --> 03:10.858
No, no, no, wait.
Tell me about her.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.463
She decapitated a man.

03:13.501 --> 03:14.729
Aah!

03:17.973 --> 03:21.704
Oh, my God. Why?

03:21.776 --> 03:26.008
Halloween.
Three years ago.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.072
Twenty years after
the first murders...

03:28.116 --> 03:30.209
her brother finally found her.

03:30.285 --> 03:34.585
Tracked her down to the school
where she was working.

03:34.689 --> 03:36.623
There were several murders.

03:36.725 --> 03:38.659
Lots of confusion.

03:56.378 --> 03:57.811
Guys, over here!

04:10.959 --> 04:13.519
Oh, my God.
She killed the wrong person.

04:15.530 --> 04:17.122
Unh!

04:19.834 --> 04:22.098
Father of three.

04:25.273 --> 04:27.764
Why didn't the paramedic
say something?

04:35.183 --> 04:38.914
His larynx had been crushed.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.478
Don't let on you know.

04:48.463 --> 04:52.160
Hello, Miss Strode.
Did you enjoy your dinner?

04:52.233 --> 04:54.292
She hasn't said a word in years.

04:54.369 --> 04:58.203
Extreme disassociative disorder.

04:58.273 --> 05:01.834
The doctors think
she's a suicide threat.

05:01.910 --> 05:05.107
They found her up
on the roof more than once.

05:08.149 --> 05:10.515
Must be the guilt.

05:10.585 --> 05:14.146
Now all she does
is stare out that window.

05:14.255 --> 05:17.019
God knows
what she sees out there.

06:25.393 --> 06:27.224
Hello?

06:31.499 --> 06:33.729
Anyone out there?

06:50.418 --> 06:51.578
Boooo!

06:51.653 --> 06:54.349
- Holy shit!
- Ha ha ha!

06:54.456 --> 06:56.924
Harold, are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

06:57.025 --> 06:58.515
No.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.424
How the hell
did you get out again?

07:01.496 --> 07:03.930
And who are you
supposed to be today?

07:04.032 --> 07:07.729
Oh. John Wayne Gacy.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.997
Born in Chicago, Illinois,
on March 17, 1942.

07:10.071 --> 07:12.005
Come on, big guy.

07:12.073 --> 07:14.507
Killed 33 people.
Buried them under his house.

07:14.576 --> 07:15.838
I know, Harold.

07:15.910 --> 07:18.504
- He was executed on May 7...
- I know, Harold.

07:21.349 --> 07:24.876
Willie, I'm not trying
to criticize your work...

07:24.953 --> 07:27.183
but if you put Harold
in his room...

07:27.255 --> 07:29.246
how come I see him
in the basement?

07:29.357 --> 07:33.259
L... But just
two seconds ago, he was...

07:33.361 --> 07:35.556
Come on. Let's go get him.

07:35.630 --> 07:37.427
How many times
do I have to tell you?

07:37.499 --> 07:39.592
You gotta be sure
what you're doing.

08:00.555 --> 08:03.217
Willie?
What are you doing?

08:03.324 --> 08:05.258
I skipped dinner.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.851
- Hurry up.
- OK.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.360
Harold?

08:17.238 --> 08:19.069
Harold,
what are you doing down here?

08:23.945 --> 08:25.173
What's gotten into you?

09:34.983 --> 09:36.917
Aah! Aah!

09:36.985 --> 09:39.852
Aah! Unh!

09:49.163 --> 09:51.324
Aah!

10:07.882 --> 10:10.510
Hmm. Ted Bundy.

10:10.585 --> 10:14.043
Born November 24, 19...

12:02.530 --> 12:05.294
Hello, Michael.

12:26.954 --> 12:31.391
I knew you'd come for me
sooner or later.

12:31.492 --> 12:34.757
What took you so long?

12:49.277 --> 12:51.302
You failed, Michael.

12:53.047 --> 12:54.708
You want to know why?

12:56.551 --> 12:58.917
Because I'm not afraid of you.

13:00.421 --> 13:01.888
But what about you?

13:04.759 --> 13:06.659
Are you afraid of me?

13:10.398 --> 13:12.263
Are you afraid to die, Michael?

13:55.476 --> 13:57.967
I just have to be sure.

14:10.925 --> 14:13.826
Unh! Unh!

14:13.895 --> 14:15.886
Aah!

14:15.997 --> 14:18.522
Aah!

14:18.599 --> 14:20.726
Aah!

14:20.801 --> 14:23.929
Aah!

14:40.855 --> 14:43.085
I'll see you in hell.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.573
Michael Myers.

15:36.644 --> 15:41.138
Born October 19, 1957.

15:41.182 --> 15:45.846
Killed his older sister,
October 31, 1963.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.789
Killed 3 high school students,
October 31, 1978.

15:50.858 --> 15:55.295
Also killed three nurses
and a paramedic, same night.

15:58.065 --> 16:00.625
Was believed to be dead,
then killed four students...

16:00.668 --> 16:01.760
Was believed to be dead,
then killed four students...

16:01.836 --> 16:04.304
Hillcrest Academy, 1998.

16:04.372 --> 16:08.809
Has been missing, unheard of,
last three years.

16:08.876 --> 16:13.142
Now he's back.

16:36.971 --> 16:38.939
Carl Jung tells us...

16:39.006 --> 16:41.839
that the human psyche
contains...

16:41.909 --> 16:43.274
a figment of ourselves...

16:43.344 --> 16:47.713
that even the collective
unconscious denies.

16:47.748 --> 16:49.773
Good morning, Paul.
It's nice to see you in class.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.545
Am I keeping you up?

16:51.619 --> 16:54.417
What do I mean by all this,
people?

16:54.488 --> 16:57.821
I mean that inside all of us...

16:57.925 --> 17:03.261
there lurks
a dark, malevolent figure.

17:03.330 --> 17:06.925
A kind of boogeyman,
if you will...

17:07.001 --> 17:09.663
that Jung called what?

17:09.737 --> 17:11.465
Stick with me, people.

17:11.539 --> 17:14.269
Take that Kierkegaardian
leap of faith.

17:17.377 --> 17:20.347
Jung said we must
face down our fears...

17:20.381 --> 17:24.477
and face up to the figure
he called... what?

17:26.921 --> 17:28.616
- The shadow.
- The shadow.

17:28.689 --> 17:30.919
Yes, Sara, very good.
Thank you.

17:31.025 --> 17:33.892
I'm glad somebody was awake.
Wow, what a class.

17:37.898 --> 17:40.594
Hey, Sara!

17:40.668 --> 17:42.260
Sara, wait up!

17:43.971 --> 17:46.201
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.604
Guess what?

17:47.675 --> 17:50.371
Uh-uh. What did you
sign us up for this time?

17:50.444 --> 17:53.413
Eee, ha ha!
We gotta find Rudy. Come on.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.290
Hey, Rudy.

18:10.364 --> 18:12.059
Don't distract me.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.294
I can't help myself.

18:14.368 --> 18:18.099
I am distracting.

18:18.172 --> 18:19.764
Have you checked your email?

18:19.840 --> 18:22.138
No.

18:22.209 --> 18:23.904
Why?
Did you send me something?

18:23.978 --> 18:26.811
We're in!
They picked all three of us!

18:26.847 --> 18:29.782
- What? Are you serious?
- Uh-huh!

18:29.850 --> 18:33.650
Oh, God! Yes!

18:33.721 --> 18:35.086
All right. That is all good.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.624
This isn't one of
your little jokes, is it?

18:37.691 --> 18:40.990
No, but Sara doesn't want to go.

18:41.061 --> 18:42.961
I might go.
I just haven't decided yet.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.794
No, no, no.
That is unacceptable.

18:45.866 --> 18:47.925
It is unacceptable.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.095
We're gonna be bigger
than "The Osbournes."

18:50.171 --> 18:51.968
We're gonna be large.

18:52.039 --> 18:54.132
Every time I let you two
talk me into something...

18:54.208 --> 18:55.539
I live to regret it.

18:55.609 --> 18:58.373
Listen, without me,
you would die of boredom.

18:58.445 --> 19:02.142
Us! Without us,
you would die of boredom.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.083
Whatever.

19:07.421 --> 19:08.888
Are you sure they're not
just putting us in some house...

19:08.956 --> 19:11.015
with hidden cameras
in the shower?

19:11.125 --> 19:13.093
No.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.389
It's like we're
investigative reporters...

19:15.462 --> 19:17.896
searching a crime scene.

19:17.998 --> 19:19.522
And look at the scholarship.

19:19.633 --> 19:21.464
Yeah.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.129
Besides that,
thousands of people...

19:24.205 --> 19:26.673
are going to see my face...

19:26.740 --> 19:29.368
our face.

19:30.644 --> 19:32.134
Don't do it.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.443
That's the house
where it all started.

19:34.481 --> 19:38.542
He walked its hallways,
hid in its closets...

19:38.619 --> 19:39.881
dreamed in its bedrooms...

19:39.954 --> 19:41.148
helped his mother
in the kitchen...

19:41.222 --> 19:43.952
watched TV in the living room
with his dad...

19:45.759 --> 19:47.522
played in his sister's bedroom.

19:49.830 --> 19:53.391
Then one day,
he picked up a knife...

19:55.002 --> 19:58.096
and he never put it down again.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.144
That guy's fucking weird.

20:13.220 --> 20:16.883
Don't pay attention to him.
He's trying to scare us.

20:16.991 --> 20:19.482
I just need to send
a quick email.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.297
"Deckard...

20:26.367 --> 20:28.927
"you'll never believe
what I got myself into."

20:31.572 --> 20:33.836
Deckard? Who's Deckard?

20:33.908 --> 20:35.535
Oh, it's my screen name.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.442
Sara needed some tech support
setting up her offline reader...

20:38.512 --> 20:39.706
so I, uh...

20:39.780 --> 20:43.011
You told her
you're a graduate student?

20:43.050 --> 20:46.110
- Graduate of what, junior high?
- Shut up, all right?

20:46.186 --> 20:50.179
We talk every day.
It's kind of like we're dating.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.724
She's never even seen you...

20:51.792 --> 20:53.726
and Yahoo chat rooms
do not count.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.695
Yes, they do count.
Did you know in the old days...

20:56.764 --> 20:58.459
knights used to spend
their entire lives...

20:58.532 --> 21:00.397
courting ladies that
they would never even touch?

21:00.467 --> 21:03.834
They would just send
each other sonnets and stuff.

21:03.904 --> 21:06.873
That's before
internet porn, man.

21:06.941 --> 21:09.239
Whatever.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.005
Now what are you doing?

21:11.078 --> 21:12.670
Just give me a second,
all right?

21:28.262 --> 21:29.695
I hope Sara shows up.

21:29.763 --> 21:31.924
And wearing
something acceptable.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.366
She can't still be mad at us
for the last time.

21:35.436 --> 21:38.803
Here she is. Hey!

21:38.872 --> 21:40.772
OK, everybody listen up!

21:40.841 --> 21:43.503
Sara, are you gonna wear this?

21:43.577 --> 21:46.876
I thought I told you
we were gonna be on camera.

21:46.914 --> 21:51.317
I'd like to start this off
by saying the search is over.

21:51.385 --> 21:53.683
You six have been selected...

21:53.754 --> 21:56.484
to explore
America's worst nightmare...

21:56.557 --> 21:58.650
tomorrow night, Halloween...

21:58.759 --> 22:01.751
live, in front of the whole
entire internet universe.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.093
You six will enter
the birthplace of evil...

22:05.165 --> 22:06.530
in its purest form...

22:06.600 --> 22:10.161
the childhood home of
our most brutal mass murderer...

22:10.237 --> 22:13.729
Michael Myers.

22:15.409 --> 22:19.140
Thank you. Thank you.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.875
So, what do you hope to find
in the house tomorrow night?

22:21.915 --> 22:24.110
My way into
network broadcasting.

22:24.184 --> 22:25.344
Pfft!

22:25.419 --> 22:27.353
I just want to say
that Michael Myers...

22:27.421 --> 22:30.049
is not just
a man behind a mask...

22:30.157 --> 22:31.283
he's a legend.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.758
I'm interested
in how Michael Myers...

22:33.827 --> 22:36.057
embodies
the politics of violence...

22:36.130 --> 22:37.825
embedded in pop mythology.

22:37.898 --> 22:41.664
Never underestimate
the effect of a poor diet.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.828
Too much protein, not enough
zinc, next thing you know...

22:43.904 --> 22:45.030
you're cutting up bodies
in your bathtub.

22:45.105 --> 22:47.699
Look at Hitler.
He was a vegetarian.

22:47.775 --> 22:49.834
The brother
was seriously malnourished.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.879
You don't have to go far
to find Michael Myers.

22:52.946 --> 22:56.609
He is the great white shark
of our unconscious.

22:56.650 --> 22:59.517
He is the dark-eyed child
of our spirits.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.180
He's every murderous impulse
we've ever had.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.724
He's the little voice
that whispers to us...

23:04.792 --> 23:06.123
to strangle the old lady...

23:06.193 --> 23:07.922
taking too long
at the checkout counter.

23:08.028 --> 23:10.360
Get to know him, baby.

23:10.431 --> 23:13.059
He's you.

23:13.133 --> 23:16.864
Tell us, Sara, why do
ordinary people turn to murder?

23:16.937 --> 23:20.134
Well, I, um...

23:20.207 --> 23:23.870
I think it has something
to do with upbringing.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.344
Aah!

23:26.413 --> 23:29.041
Damn! That girl can sing.

23:30.851 --> 23:36.187
That's what
I'm looking for. Ooh.

23:36.256 --> 23:39.248
Ha! Hunh!

23:39.359 --> 23:41.452
Hyah!

23:41.562 --> 23:43.792
Get his ass! Get his ass!
Get his ass!

23:46.166 --> 23:48.134
Who's better than Wat Chun Lee?

23:48.202 --> 23:50.602
Whoopin' everybody ass
while he's smokin' a cigarette.

23:52.439 --> 23:55.931
Oh, shit. Who's knockin'
on my door this late?

23:56.009 --> 23:57.340
Whoever this is
is distracting me...

23:57.411 --> 24:00.346
from seeing Wat Chun Lee
whoop some ass.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.974
Sara? Ooh.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.715
Sara, what are you doing here?
It's late.

24:06.787 --> 24:08.414
I'm dropping out.

24:08.489 --> 24:09.956
What?

24:10.057 --> 24:11.388
I'm sorry.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.086
It's just I'm so freaked out
I can't even sleep.

24:14.194 --> 24:17.129
Slow down, slow down.
What's the problem?

24:17.197 --> 24:20.530
Can't you see
I'm not like the others?

24:20.601 --> 24:22.660
I know
you're not like the others.

24:22.736 --> 24:24.499
You know
you're not like the others.

24:24.571 --> 24:26.436
The others ain't nothin'
but a bunch...

24:26.507 --> 24:29.271
of smart-ass, wise-crackin',
posin' wannabes.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.675
You are the real deal.

24:31.745 --> 24:33.975
Every existing element
about you...

24:34.014 --> 24:37.142
is what the internet audience
really wants.

24:37.217 --> 24:38.912
I don't want to be famous.

24:38.986 --> 24:40.920
What do you mean
you don't want to be famous?

24:40.988 --> 24:43.684
That's the American dream.

24:43.757 --> 24:45.918
I think I'm just scared.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.324
It's OK to be scared.

24:48.395 --> 24:50.488
Being scared is good.
Fear is good.

24:50.597 --> 24:52.861
Fear motivates.

24:52.933 --> 24:55.527
Fear gives you
the feeling of being alive.

24:55.602 --> 24:56.864
Fear makes me want to throw up.

24:56.937 --> 24:58.837
Trust me, please.

24:58.906 --> 25:00.737
When it's all said and done,
at the end of the day...

25:00.807 --> 25:03.298
you'd be surprised of
how much you surprise yourself.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.039
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just...

25:06.113 --> 25:08.673
It's OK. Do me a favor.
Sleep on it.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.650
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You can sweat it tonight, man.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.278
Now take your tail on outta here
and go to bed.

25:16.290 --> 25:19.623
Ol' Freddie boy, damn, you good.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.490
Shit you come up with
off the top of your head, boy.

25:22.563 --> 25:26.329
Why don't you just
pat yourself on your back?

25:26.400 --> 25:28.664
Oh, Wat Chun Lee! Oh!

25:39.680 --> 25:41.011
Now, are you coming out soon...

25:41.081 --> 25:42.639
or are you
planning on subletting?

25:44.251 --> 25:48.551
Mmm! Sexy girl! Ha ha!

25:48.622 --> 25:50.647
Don't you think
it's a bit too revealing?

25:50.757 --> 25:53.885
I think
it's perfectly revealing.

25:53.994 --> 25:55.120
Aah!

25:56.597 --> 25:57.757
What?

25:58.999 --> 26:00.864
Are you OK?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.266
Did you see the
boogeyman or something?

26:03.337 --> 26:07.103
The boogeyman?
How very Jungian.

26:07.174 --> 26:10.735
Dr. Mixter's class?
I'm taking that course, too.

26:10.811 --> 26:12.836
I hope they have this in black.

26:12.913 --> 26:16.144
- Thrift stores.
- Oh, how marvelous, darling.

26:16.183 --> 26:19.380
Ahh, there she is.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.717
Oh, my God,
you've been pussy-whipped.

26:21.788 --> 26:25.087
What's worse,
you've been cyber-whipped.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.716
By the way,
where's your costume?

26:26.827 --> 26:29.318
I can't go out tonight.

26:29.429 --> 26:31.329
I promised Sara
I would watch her first episode.

26:31.398 --> 26:33.059
She's really nervous about it.

26:33.133 --> 26:37.570
No, Mickey Stern's party
is tonight, and you know that.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.766
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, man.
I guess I forgot.

26:40.841 --> 26:43.537
Forgot?
Do you have any idea...

26:43.610 --> 26:45.475
what it means for
two freshmen to get invited?

26:45.545 --> 26:47.069
It's never happened before!

26:47.114 --> 26:48.240
Your sister invited us...

26:48.315 --> 26:50.374
so you wouldn't tell
your mother about her tattoo.

26:50.450 --> 26:52.941
That's besides the point,
Myles Barton.

26:53.020 --> 26:55.784
You can sit here in your little
dream fantasy world...

26:55.856 --> 26:58.791
or you can come with me
to this party...

26:58.859 --> 27:00.622
and learn to walk like a man.

27:00.727 --> 27:02.661
What's it gonna be?

27:05.299 --> 27:06.766
All right, let's go.

27:06.867 --> 27:10.030
Ahh, chat room romance?

27:10.103 --> 27:11.934
He's just a friend.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.667
He's probably fifty and bald,
with a bad toupee.

27:14.741 --> 27:19.838
- Jen.
- Probably collects human skin.

27:19.913 --> 27:21.608
Give me a break, Jen.

27:21.648 --> 27:23.240
OK, everybody listen up.

27:23.317 --> 27:25.114
I'd like to start off
by saying...

27:25.185 --> 27:26.914
the home that
you will be entering tonight...

27:26.987 --> 27:28.511
has been rigged up
with several cameras...

27:28.588 --> 27:29.816
but for the most part...

27:29.890 --> 27:34.156
the audience will see
only what you see.

27:34.261 --> 27:35.353
See these cameras right here?

27:35.462 --> 27:37.953
I kinda like these cameras.

27:38.065 --> 27:41.466
They can pretty much be
clipped on to anything.

27:41.568 --> 27:44.662
A hat, shirt collar,
your coat collar.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.398
The viewers
can pretty much control...

27:48.475 --> 27:49.669
what they want to watch...

27:49.743 --> 27:52.109
switch around
from camera to camera...

27:52.179 --> 27:54.909
depending on what seems to be
the most intriguing to them.

27:54.948 --> 27:58.145
So if you guys want
to be stars for the night...

27:58.218 --> 28:01.187
I suggest you do something
that is very interesting...

28:01.254 --> 28:03.347
so that it's worth the while
of the viewers...

28:03.457 --> 28:06.984
to want to keep
their cameras on you.

28:07.094 --> 28:09.494
Cameras are so phallic.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.758
Is that good or bad?

28:11.832 --> 28:13.322
Depends who's watching.

28:32.919 --> 28:37.151
Hey, Orson Welles,
pick a placement and move on.

28:39.359 --> 28:43.386
Look, low angles... scary.

28:43.497 --> 28:46.193
High angles... scary.

28:46.266 --> 28:49.963
Medium angles... boring.

28:50.036 --> 28:51.298
I bet you learned that
shooting...

28:51.371 --> 28:52.929
all those weddings
and bar mitzvahs.

28:53.006 --> 28:54.405
Hey, hey!

28:54.474 --> 28:58.376
I went to Long Beach State.
Same as Spielberg.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.538
Charley,
we're on a schedule here.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.912
Tell Max to rig a camera
in the sister's room.

29:02.949 --> 29:06.043
Max is back at the hotel
helping Freddie.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.144
OK.

30:35.809 --> 30:37.674
Freddie!

30:37.744 --> 30:40.008
Baby, calm down.
It's all good. Just relax.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.173
I got it all under control.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.345
There was this Firebird
parked in front of the house.

30:46.419 --> 30:48.785
Totally about to ruin
the establishing shot...

30:48.855 --> 30:51.085
but I called a tow truck.

30:51.191 --> 30:52.783
Yep, it's on its way.

30:52.893 --> 30:55.327
All righty. Bye.

30:59.165 --> 31:02.999
Look at you, Charley.
That's a nice angle, boy.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.269
Look, there he is now.

31:08.341 --> 31:10.502
All right, here we go.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.908
Mr. Harris!

31:11.978 --> 31:13.946
Can we ask you
a few questions, Mr. Harris?

31:13.980 --> 31:16.346
- Right over here.
- I got one word for you.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.849
- What's that?
- Product placement.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.044
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:19.119 --> 31:21.178
Product placement,
I like the sound of that.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.085
While we're going
around the house...

31:23.156 --> 31:24.851
discovering the secrets
of Michael Myers...

31:24.958 --> 31:30.225
we could be drinking Pepsi
or sporting The Gap, right?

31:30.297 --> 31:35.200
Nice sexy thinking.
I kind of like that.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.792
How's everyone doing
this evening?

31:36.870 --> 31:38.895
We'll get it started
like this, see?

31:38.972 --> 31:40.462
In the next ten minutes...

31:40.540 --> 31:41.802
we are going to enter
a mystery...

31:41.875 --> 31:44.105
wrapped up inside of a riddle
inside of an enigma.

31:44.177 --> 31:47.442
Now, remember this.
Everything you see...

31:47.480 --> 31:50.381
absolutely everything
you see is real.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.247
There's no actors...

31:52.319 --> 31:54.378
none of the components
or contents in the house...

31:54.454 --> 31:56.388
have been messed with,
mixed up, diluted...

31:56.456 --> 32:00.415
or tampered with in any shape,
form, or fashion whatsoever.

32:00.527 --> 32:03.223
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what's gonna happen...

32:03.296 --> 32:06.231
but what I do know is
that no one will be allowed...

32:06.299 --> 32:08.290
to leave
until the show is over.

32:08.368 --> 32:11.235
Our state-of-the-art
camera surveillance system...

32:11.304 --> 32:13.568
will pick up
anyone who tries to sneak out.

32:18.345 --> 32:23.840
Let the Dangertainment begin
out this motherfucker.

32:23.883 --> 32:27.182
Well, people, let's do it.

32:50.110 --> 32:52.101
Rudy!

32:55.048 --> 32:59.417
Way to go.
This is gonna be fun.

33:21.841 --> 33:23.274
I read that
after the murders...

33:23.343 --> 33:24.605
the family
just sealed it up...

33:24.678 --> 33:27.169
and left without
taking anything with them.

33:27.213 --> 33:31.206
It's not exactly
a house you put on the market.

33:31.284 --> 33:32.876
Yeah, but I'll bet it has...

33:32.952 --> 33:35.853
one of those big nice
old kitchens, you know?

33:37.857 --> 33:38.949
Where are you going?

33:39.059 --> 33:40.549
I'm gonna check it out.

33:40.660 --> 33:43.561
What are we gonna do?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.564
We don't have to do anything.

33:45.665 --> 33:48.031
Technically,
we just have to be in the house.

33:48.101 --> 33:50.365
Aren't we supposed
to be looking for answers?

33:50.437 --> 33:53.201
The devil made him do it.
I'm done.

33:54.607 --> 33:56.541
We owe it
to the people watching...

33:56.609 --> 33:59.976
to at least take a look around.

34:00.046 --> 34:01.377
Oh, that's cute.

34:01.414 --> 34:04.178
You're already worried
about your fan base?

34:07.053 --> 34:11.387
You are this close
to getting voted off the island.

34:15.395 --> 34:17.795
Hey, check this out.

34:17.864 --> 34:20.025
You want something
tasty and delicious?

34:22.001 --> 34:23.900
You ever tasted
forty-year-old fennel?

34:23.969 --> 34:27.167
Eww, don't.
It's got to be rotten.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.231
- That's strange.
- What?

34:29.309 --> 34:32.972
- It smells fresh.
- Yeah, it does.

34:36.248 --> 34:39.241
You know, Donna,
you got great legs.

34:39.319 --> 34:40.946
What time do they open?

34:42.288 --> 34:43.755
That'd be 1:00?

34:45.558 --> 34:47.422
God damn.

34:50.563 --> 34:52.588
Sara.

34:55.668 --> 34:58.330
You think this is the one
that he used to do his thing?

34:58.404 --> 35:01.601
No. They'd keep that in
an evidence locker somewhere.

35:01.674 --> 35:03.039
Whew.

35:10.850 --> 35:13.546
- Boo.
- Aah!

35:13.620 --> 35:16.953
- What, are you scared?
- No.

35:17.023 --> 35:18.422
What's in here?

35:24.197 --> 35:25.425
What is that?

35:30.503 --> 35:32.869
OK, so I admit...

35:32.939 --> 35:36.170
that this place
is a little creepy, OK?

35:36.242 --> 35:39.473
No, no, no.
You have no idea.

35:39.546 --> 35:43.038
- Look at this.
- Wow, a chair.

35:43.082 --> 35:44.344
My God.

35:44.417 --> 35:47.409
Do you think they actually
kept him in this?

35:49.222 --> 35:50.382
What is that?

35:50.456 --> 35:53.323
Looks like the medieval key
to Sara's chastity belt.

35:53.393 --> 35:55.657
- Rudy!
- OK, yeah.

35:55.728 --> 35:58.629
Maybe we should
poke around a bit...

35:58.698 --> 36:00.131
see what else we can find.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.397
Ha! Aye-aye, captain.

36:04.737 --> 36:07.900
Why are you touching me?

36:07.974 --> 36:09.566
Don't.

36:11.344 --> 36:13.141
Go poke.

36:44.344 --> 36:46.972
Hey, what's going on?

36:47.013 --> 36:48.742
Sexy.

36:50.216 --> 36:52.480
Look at you!

36:57.390 --> 36:58.880
Scott, what are we doing here?

36:58.992 --> 37:01.620
Hey, come on, man,
be cool, all right?

37:01.728 --> 37:04.561
Relax. Have fun. Shit.

37:05.965 --> 37:07.432
Hey, Myles,
do you think anyone will know...

37:07.533 --> 37:09.797
we're supposed to be
from "Pulp Fiction"?

37:34.594 --> 37:35.720
- Huhh!
- Huhh!

38:14.434 --> 38:16.368
Today, you're scared of
the boogeyman.

38:16.436 --> 38:18.301
Ha ha ha!

38:18.371 --> 38:21.829
He's gonna get you.
He's coming behind you.

38:21.908 --> 38:23.273
Boogeyman!

39:19.832 --> 39:21.823
Ohh! Shit!

39:21.901 --> 39:23.835
Careful, Jen.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.667
Ahem. Hands off, bud.

39:45.992 --> 39:49.086
Bet this is Judith's room.

39:49.195 --> 39:52.653
You know, the older sister.

39:52.765 --> 39:56.098
The one he killed
when he was six years old.

39:56.169 --> 40:00.071
Hey! Keep the camera
on the money here.

40:00.139 --> 40:02.937
I think it happened
when she was right there.

40:04.844 --> 40:07.108
Poor little Judith...

40:07.146 --> 40:09.114
helpless...

40:09.182 --> 40:12.447
brushing her hair...

40:12.518 --> 40:16.215
young... and naked.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.891
Yeah, because
that's gonna happen, right?

40:19.992 --> 40:21.926
Come on, Jen.

40:21.994 --> 40:23.723
One flash,
and you could light up...

40:23.796 --> 40:26.663
a thousand computer screens.

40:26.732 --> 40:28.427
Launch your whole career.

40:35.675 --> 40:37.142
You think?

41:05.271 --> 41:08.172
You crack me up.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.173
It's a good wardrobe
for you, Jen.

41:26.459 --> 41:29.121
Wait! No! There was
somebody else in the hall!

41:31.998 --> 41:34.296
Come on.

41:43.442 --> 41:46.309
Come on, lover boy.

41:46.379 --> 41:47.971
- Whoa!
- Aah!

41:48.014 --> 41:51.211
What are you doing,
you big perv?

41:51.284 --> 41:54.685
They're exploring the house
of a mass murderer... live.

41:54.754 --> 41:55.880
You want to watch?

41:55.955 --> 41:57.855
- No way.
- Sure.

41:57.957 --> 41:59.549
Oh, OK.

41:59.659 --> 42:01.251
Impulse control disorder.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.055
Huh?

42:03.162 --> 42:05.926
That's my theory.

42:05.998 --> 42:09.798
I think Michael Myers
had fits of rage...

42:09.869 --> 42:12.394
that he could not control.

42:12.471 --> 42:18.376
Kind of like a klepto
or a nympho or a pyro.

42:20.613 --> 42:23.707
So, instead of
stealing silverware...

42:23.783 --> 42:27.150
he slashes the necks
of teenage girls, huh?

42:27.220 --> 42:29.745
Oh, come on...

42:29.822 --> 42:33.258
haven't you ever had an impulse
that you could not control?

42:33.359 --> 42:36.760
- Continuously.
- You mean continually.

42:36.862 --> 42:40.263
"Continuous" means
continuing uninterrupted...

42:40.366 --> 42:43.358
while "continual" means
reoccurring periodically.

42:43.436 --> 42:46.269
Donna, when are you gonna
get out of your head...

42:46.339 --> 42:47.738
and start thinking
with your body?

42:47.807 --> 42:49.832
Please.

42:49.909 --> 42:51.433
Does that line
ever actually work...

42:51.510 --> 42:53.205
on the chicks
in the music department?

42:53.279 --> 42:56.942
Art history, too.
Sometimes even poli sci.

42:56.983 --> 42:59.611
Well, it doesn't cut it
with critical studies.

42:59.685 --> 43:00.845
Bummer.

43:04.023 --> 43:06.821
Besides,
screwing a music major...

43:06.926 --> 43:10.157
would be tantamount
to lesbianism.

43:10.229 --> 43:11.753
I could get into that.

43:19.205 --> 43:21.503
Sara, I'm telling you,
it's in the food.

43:21.574 --> 43:23.269
Remember that guy
who was on trial...

43:23.342 --> 43:24.741
for murder in San Francisco?

43:24.810 --> 43:26.277
All he ate was Twinkies.

43:26.345 --> 43:29.678
Rudy, do you ever think about
anything other than food?

43:29.715 --> 43:31.444
Wouldn't you like to know?

43:33.986 --> 43:35.647
Jen?

43:41.060 --> 43:43.028
Jen?

43:43.129 --> 43:44.221
What's going on?

43:44.330 --> 43:45.661
- What happened?
- I don't know.

43:45.731 --> 43:47.392
I turned my back for a second
and she was gone.

43:47.466 --> 43:48.660
Jen!

43:48.734 --> 43:50.326
Jen?

43:56.509 --> 43:57.669
Jen?

43:59.178 --> 44:00.338
Jen.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.009
Jen?

44:10.423 --> 44:11.720
Jen?

44:15.094 --> 44:16.186
Jen?

44:21.067 --> 44:22.796
Turn it down!

44:22.868 --> 44:25.962
- Gotcha!
- God, you bitch.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.198
Slut!

44:27.273 --> 44:30.800
That's not right, OK?
You're foul.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.844
Uhh, so foul.

44:32.912 --> 44:37.611
This is to us,
for successfully...

44:37.650 --> 44:39.345
let me give you
a little more...

44:39.418 --> 44:41.352
puttin' together
something collectively...

44:41.420 --> 44:44.446
so ingenious
as a team and a duo...

44:44.557 --> 44:46.787
that we should definitely
be able to secure...

44:46.892 --> 44:48.826
a lot of food on the table
for ourselves...

44:48.928 --> 44:51.158
as long as everything
goes as nicely...

44:51.230 --> 44:52.663
as it's goin' right now.

44:59.939 --> 45:02.737
I'm gonna get her back
for that.

45:02.808 --> 45:03.968
Watch me.

45:06.512 --> 45:08.673
Oh, my God!

45:08.714 --> 45:10.306
Cheers.

45:15.287 --> 45:17.983
Oh, no! No!

45:19.191 --> 45:22.354
Mm. Mm.

45:22.461 --> 45:23.860
Wait, what just happened?

45:23.929 --> 45:27.330
- We just lost Bill's camera.
- Oh, shit.

45:27.433 --> 45:30.266
He must've dropped it.
Fucking idiot.

45:30.336 --> 45:31.928
Find another view quickly,
please.

45:32.004 --> 45:33.835
Freddie, relax.

45:33.906 --> 45:35.806
I think
this is going really well.

45:35.875 --> 45:37.809
- Really, baby?
- Yes.

45:37.877 --> 45:39.469
We are doing our thing.

45:39.545 --> 45:40.705
OK.

45:40.746 --> 45:43.078
To Dangertainment.

45:43.149 --> 45:46.084
Salute. Heh heh heh.

45:46.152 --> 45:50.418
And this must be the bed
where he was conceived.

45:50.489 --> 45:52.719
Stop showing off, Jen.

46:19.218 --> 46:20.583
Aaaah!

46:20.653 --> 46:22.120
Aaaah!

46:22.188 --> 46:23.985
Rudy!

46:24.056 --> 46:25.887
- Sara!
- Jen, help me!

46:25.991 --> 46:27.151
Are you OK?

46:28.727 --> 46:33.130
Rudy, help. Sara!

46:33.199 --> 46:36.430
Ewww.

46:36.502 --> 46:38.766
- God.
- What happened?

46:38.838 --> 46:41.170
What is that thing?

46:47.012 --> 46:50.914
Hey, is this
that Michael Myers thing?

46:50.983 --> 46:52.314
Yeah.

46:52.384 --> 46:54.716
A'ight, cool.

46:55.988 --> 46:58.218
Yeah, OK.

47:08.701 --> 47:10.032
What is this?

47:15.941 --> 47:19.240
Oh. Sorry.

47:19.311 --> 47:21.176
Are you?

47:21.213 --> 47:23.545
You're such a Lothario.

47:23.616 --> 47:25.413
Um...

47:25.484 --> 47:28.385
I don't know what that
means exactly, but...

47:28.454 --> 47:29.978
Just go with it.

47:31.657 --> 47:33.921
Hold on.
I just thought of something.

47:35.127 --> 47:38.062
Hold on?

47:38.163 --> 47:40.131
You've got to be kidding me.

47:40.232 --> 47:43.395
What, are you
looking for "Playboys"?

47:51.443 --> 47:53.104
This ain't right.

47:53.178 --> 47:56.739
Well, it's obvious
that the boy was subject...

47:56.782 --> 48:00.343
to emotional and physical abuse.

48:00.419 --> 48:03.149
No, all of this.
It's not right.

48:03.222 --> 48:05.156
It's too easy.

48:05.257 --> 48:08.226
Why is all this stuff
still here?

48:08.327 --> 48:10.693
Answer that, Nancy Drew.

48:10.763 --> 48:13.732
Where's Bill?

48:13.832 --> 48:16.198
He's probably
still mad at me.

48:16.268 --> 48:20.728
He's gonna jump out
of somewhere and scare me.

48:20.806 --> 48:22.273
You watch.

48:25.177 --> 48:27.008
You watch.

48:51.537 --> 48:55.473
Jim? Uh.

49:07.686 --> 49:11.850
You know, if I'm keeping you
from something...

49:11.957 --> 49:13.185
just let me know.

49:13.292 --> 49:14.554
Look.

49:21.367 --> 49:24.336
- Voilà.
- Clever boy.

49:35.014 --> 49:36.982
See,
they're looking for clues.

49:37.049 --> 49:40.177
Something that might explain
why Michael Myers went bad.

49:40.252 --> 49:42.413
- Oh.
- Jeez.

49:42.488 --> 49:43.978
Hey, Scott. What's up?

49:44.056 --> 49:46.422
God, nice costume.

50:16.055 --> 50:17.352
Whoa.

50:20.559 --> 50:24.325
Hey, you think
they kept him down here?

50:24.396 --> 50:27.695
Maybe. Look at this.

50:27.766 --> 50:31.725
What? What is it?

50:31.804 --> 50:34.272
It's some sort
of weird harness.

50:34.339 --> 50:39.572
This whole place looks like
some sadistic playpen.

50:43.248 --> 50:45.182
Ah ha ha.

50:45.250 --> 50:48.310
And you know what
that makes me think?

50:48.387 --> 50:49.718
What?

50:49.788 --> 50:53.383
There's definitely
no cameras down here.

51:21.487 --> 51:23.079
I could be a camera.

51:29.027 --> 51:30.551
Say something smart.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.398
Existence precedes essence.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.267
God, you are sexy.

52:04.830 --> 52:09.392
Whoa! Oh, shit!

52:16.642 --> 52:18.075
That worked perfectly!

52:18.143 --> 52:21.010
Whoa! That is
what I'm talking about.

52:22.281 --> 52:25.250
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! All his victims!

52:25.317 --> 52:28.115
It's a mass grave!

52:28.187 --> 52:29.552
Oh, my God!

52:34.459 --> 52:36.484
Oh, God.

52:36.595 --> 52:39.655
All of his victims. Oh!

52:41.300 --> 52:43.860
Shit. Look at this.

52:43.936 --> 52:45.995
I don't
fucking believe this.

52:46.071 --> 52:47.470
What?

52:47.539 --> 52:50.337
Made in fucking Taiwan.

53:58.677 --> 54:00.838
Oh, shit, man!

54:00.879 --> 54:02.938
Charley,
where the fuck you been?

54:03.015 --> 54:05.677
We've been lookin' all over
this motherfucker for you!

54:05.751 --> 54:07.946
And why the hell are you
dressed like me anyway?

54:08.020 --> 54:09.920
I ain't payin' you
to be Michael Myers.

54:09.988 --> 54:11.717
I'm playin' Michael Myers!

54:11.790 --> 54:13.314
If them kids come around...

54:13.425 --> 54:15.290
and see us dressed up
in the same shit...

54:15.360 --> 54:18.761
you'll ruin the whole effect,
God damn it.

54:18.830 --> 54:21.128
What the hell
is wrong with you?

54:21.199 --> 54:24.100
What you lookin' at me
like that for?

54:24.169 --> 54:26.729
Huh? You don't get it?

54:26.805 --> 54:28.932
Your shit ain't workin'
up there?

54:29.007 --> 54:32.170
Take your ass in the back
of the garage with Nora.

54:32.244 --> 54:33.506
That's your job.

54:33.578 --> 54:36.308
Go back there with Nora
and help her ass out.

54:36.348 --> 54:37.576
Go do your job.

54:37.649 --> 54:41.176
I left the back door
unlocked for your ass...

54:41.253 --> 54:44.188
to go out the back
into the garage.

54:44.256 --> 54:45.450
That's what I did.

54:45.557 --> 54:48.253
You need to get the hell
outta here.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.294
Go on, scoot! Skedaddle!

54:50.362 --> 54:52.455
Get the fuck out of Dodge!

54:59.571 --> 55:02.699
God damn. What the hell's
somebody gotta do...

55:02.774 --> 55:05.140
to get a little decent help
up in this motherfucker?

55:05.210 --> 55:07.405
God damn it. Come on.

55:07.446 --> 55:09.812
Let's go find Freddie.

55:13.719 --> 55:15.687
This is bullshit.

55:32.471 --> 55:33.961
Hey, Jim?

55:37.209 --> 55:39.268
You gotta see this.

56:27.125 --> 56:29.559
Gross.

56:33.765 --> 56:35.528
Hey, Freddie.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.068
Is this all part of the setup?

56:54.019 --> 56:57.352
"Laurie Strode,
sister of Michael Myers...

56:57.422 --> 57:00.084
"survives Halloween night
massacre."

57:11.703 --> 57:14.501
Heh. Nice prop.

57:16.041 --> 57:17.303
Aah!

57:18.910 --> 57:20.070
Oh, my God!

57:22.314 --> 57:25.477
Oh, my God!

57:25.550 --> 57:27.780
Is anybody else seeing this?

57:30.655 --> 57:32.088
Jim?

57:36.862 --> 57:38.295
Aaah!

57:39.764 --> 57:41.061
Aaah!

57:43.735 --> 57:45.293
Aah! Oh, my God!

57:45.370 --> 57:46.962
No!

57:52.744 --> 57:55.269
Help! Somebody!

57:55.313 --> 57:57.941
Someone help! Oh, my God!

57:58.016 --> 58:01.281
This isn't funny anymore!

58:02.988 --> 58:06.446
Help me! Somebody help!

58:06.558 --> 58:07.650
This is not funny!

58:12.964 --> 58:14.864
Oh, my God!

58:14.933 --> 58:17.493
Stay away from me! Aah!

58:18.570 --> 58:22.267
Aah! Aah!

58:22.340 --> 58:24.365
Aah!

58:28.547 --> 58:30.014
Aah!

58:56.308 --> 58:58.003
That was so fake.

58:58.076 --> 58:59.737
No, no, wait.
Wait, you guys.

58:59.811 --> 59:03.076
That really happened.
She was just killed.

59:05.550 --> 59:07.575
Man, you're gullible.

59:07.652 --> 59:09.119
Get outta here.

59:17.862 --> 59:19.796
It's a good thing
there's no cameras in here.

59:22.334 --> 59:24.302
We're wearing cameras.

59:28.406 --> 59:29.566
Whoosh.

01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:02.272
Aaaah!

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.570
Michael's here!

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.736
I saw him!
He's in the house!

01:00:06.778 --> 01:00:08.336
He's here!

01:00:09.614 --> 01:00:10.808
Oh, my God.

01:00:10.882 --> 01:00:13.316
What's going on?
What you talking about?

01:00:13.385 --> 01:00:14.647
Don't do this, girl.

01:00:14.719 --> 01:00:16.619
You're bringing me down
on this beautiful evening.

01:00:16.688 --> 01:00:19.179
There's nobody here.
You're just bugging out.

01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:20.485
It's not funny, OK?

01:00:20.592 --> 01:00:23.083
- Stop it, OK?
- He's down in that room.

01:00:23.194 --> 01:00:27.062
There is 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 people in the house.

01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:29.293
There's no Michael Myers here.
There's nobody.

01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:31.927
Listen,
I saw him right over there.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:34.233
He's in here?
Ooh. Michael Myers.

01:00:34.306 --> 01:00:35.432
Where's Michael Myers?

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:37.372
Michael Myers!
I don't see nothing.

01:00:37.442 --> 01:00:40.070
- He was in here.
- You're bringing me down.

01:00:40.111 --> 01:00:42.272
Rudy, I saw... Aaaah!

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:44.076
Rudy!

01:00:44.149 --> 01:00:47.175
Uhh! Uhh!

01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:49.015
- Fucker!
- Whoa, whoa!

01:00:49.087 --> 01:00:51.578
Turn off the cameras!

01:00:51.656 --> 01:00:54.022
- Get it back online.
- What's wrong?

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:55.683
Cut to
a different camera angle.

01:00:55.794 --> 01:00:59.457
It's me. Freddie.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.965
Freddie.
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:02.067 --> 01:01:03.659
Damn, man, you hit me...

01:01:03.735 --> 01:01:06.431
like I murdered
your fuckin' mother.

01:01:06.504 --> 01:01:08.062
Relax, man.

01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:10.505
I'm only tryin'
to give America a good show.

01:01:10.575 --> 01:01:13.339
So none of
this shit is real, right?

01:01:13.411 --> 01:01:14.708
Like the furniture...

01:01:14.746 --> 01:01:16.976
the photos,
all the fucked up toys?

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.845
It's all fake.
We've been set up.

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:21.044
You knew you didn't have
a show anyone would watch...

01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:23.553
so you set us all up
at our fucking expense, huh?

01:01:23.621 --> 01:01:25.589
What expense
are you talkin' about?

01:01:25.657 --> 01:01:28.387
You ain't contributed a dime
to settin' up this shit.

01:01:28.493 --> 01:01:31.018
Besides, don't nobody
want to see any of y'all...

01:01:31.129 --> 01:01:32.824
runnin' around
no empty house...

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:35.331
possibly comin' up
with nothing any-damn-way.

01:01:35.433 --> 01:01:37.731
America don't like reality,
first of all.

01:01:37.802 --> 01:01:40.965
Second of all,
they think the shit is boring.

01:01:41.039 --> 01:01:43.303
They want
a little razzle-dazzle...

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:46.242
a little pizazz,
a little thrill in their life.

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:48.108
And us being the ones
that give it to 'em...

01:01:48.146 --> 01:01:50.171
I don't see
nothin' wrong with that.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.307
I did not sign up for this.

01:01:52.384 --> 01:01:54.648
Y'all need to do me a favor,
all right?

01:01:54.719 --> 01:01:58.120
Go along with this shit.
Don't blow it. Not now.

01:01:58.189 --> 01:02:00.248
You really have no idea...

01:02:00.358 --> 01:02:02.155
of how nicely
I worked things out...

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.818
so that we all can receive...

01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:07.056
somewhat of a robust back end
when this shit is all over.

01:02:07.132 --> 01:02:09.692
I don't know what you want to do
about your share...

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.633
but please
don't fuck it up for me.

01:02:11.703 --> 01:02:13.830
I want my money, a'ight?

01:02:13.905 --> 01:02:16.772
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go...

01:02:16.841 --> 01:02:19.105
scare the shit out of some more
of these motherfuckers...

01:02:19.177 --> 01:02:22.010
so, I'm gonna get it crackin'.

01:02:22.046 --> 01:02:24.412
Y'all do what
the fuck y'all gotta do.

01:02:24.482 --> 01:02:27.007
See y'all. Ha ha ha ha!

01:02:27.085 --> 01:02:29.610
- All right.
- We have it.

01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:31.951
- Turn up the sound.
- Where'd everybody go?

01:02:54.012 --> 01:02:55.309
Ohh.

01:02:56.881 --> 01:02:58.371
There you are, Bill.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.112
So what
do you guys want to do?

01:03:01.186 --> 01:03:04.280
I don't know.
I could use the money.

01:03:04.355 --> 01:03:07.654
No. Fuck that.
I'm out.

01:03:07.759 --> 01:03:09.158
Me too. I quit.

01:03:13.932 --> 01:03:15.160
Boo!

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.764
She must be going
for the first internet Emmy.

01:03:24.409 --> 01:03:25.774
You can't scare us, Jen.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.175
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

01:03:34.385 --> 01:03:35.682
You too, Freddie.

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:42.983
Aaaaaaah!

01:03:53.238 --> 01:03:55.399
- Eww!
- How'd they do that?

01:03:55.473 --> 01:03:58.408
- Digital effects.
- No, it isn't!

01:03:59.978 --> 01:04:01.138
Hello. 911?

01:04:03.915 --> 01:04:06.076
Oh, my God.

01:04:10.121 --> 01:04:12.749
- It's locked!
- Fuck.

01:04:12.857 --> 01:04:15.485
Go in there!
Go in there now!

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:37.479
Jim, run! Run!

01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:39.244
Ah!

01:04:39.317 --> 01:04:42.309
Oh! Aah!

01:04:51.329 --> 01:04:53.354
Uhh.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:16.845
Hey, Michael!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

01:05:16.921 --> 01:05:18.889
You want a piece of me?

01:05:36.174 --> 01:05:39.007
You should try a little less
protein in your diet.

01:05:39.077 --> 01:05:41.238
Control some
of that aggression, huh?

01:06:00.231 --> 01:06:01.357
Want some of this, huh?

01:06:02.867 --> 01:06:05.028
I know what 911 is for!

01:06:05.103 --> 01:06:07.162
This is an emergency.
It's not a hoax.

01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:12.699
Motherfucker, come on.
Trying to fucking kill me?

01:06:12.777 --> 01:06:15.337
Come on!
You like sushi, motherfucker?!

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.508
You gonna fucking kill me?

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:19.845
Oh, shit.

01:07:16.274 --> 01:07:18.003
Somebody...

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.907
somebody out there,
please help us.

01:07:19.977 --> 01:07:22.605
Somebody, please help us.

01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:25.673
She really is
a very talented actress.

01:07:39.363 --> 01:07:41.194
Deckard.

01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:43.631
Deckard, if you're there,
please let me know.

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:47.496
Who's Deckard?
Myles is Deckard.

01:07:47.572 --> 01:07:48.698
What do you mean?

01:07:54.412 --> 01:07:58.940
Deckard,
he's killing all of us.

01:07:59.016 --> 01:08:00.313
He's killing us.

01:08:00.384 --> 01:08:01.544
There he is!
Upper right!

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.849
- Zoom in!
- Go to the other camera.

01:08:03.921 --> 01:08:05.411
Tell her
he's coming up the stairs.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:08.323
This isn't funny anymore!
Do something!

01:08:27.545 --> 01:08:28.738
Aah!

01:08:31.215 --> 01:08:34.207
- He heard her!
- Oh, my God.

01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:38.486
He's at the door!

01:08:38.555 --> 01:08:40.148
Get her out!

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:14.483
Oh, my God.

01:09:14.591 --> 01:09:16.617
- No!
- It's too high!

01:09:29.473 --> 01:09:30.599
No!

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:39.675
Aaah!

01:09:50.995 --> 01:09:52.859
I can't see you!

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.635
Deckard, where is he?

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.228
Tell her to go!

01:10:32.303 --> 01:10:34.328
- Now's her chance.
- Come on, go!

01:11:19.784 --> 01:11:23.413
My God. Everybody's dead.

01:11:23.487 --> 01:11:25.955
Where is he?

01:11:26.057 --> 01:11:27.991
I don't know.

01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:32.018
We got to get the fuck
outta here now.

01:11:32.129 --> 01:11:33.721
Come on. Let's go.

01:11:53.484 --> 01:11:55.475
Oh, shit.

01:11:55.553 --> 01:11:57.384
Aaah!

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:14.296
So, you want to be
on Dangertainment?

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.307
Let's see what you got.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:20.071
Waa... hyah!

01:12:26.517 --> 01:12:27.916
Hyah!

01:12:40.297 --> 01:12:42.288
Aah!

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.634
Yo, Mike, come see me.

01:12:45.703 --> 01:12:49.070
Michael, come and see me!
Look at me!

01:12:53.644 --> 01:12:56.238
You wanna fuck with me, huh?

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.248
You motherfucker.

01:12:58.315 --> 01:12:59.907
Haaa-yah!

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:36.678
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

01:13:36.754 --> 01:13:38.551
You all right?

01:13:38.622 --> 01:13:41.455
I saw his room.

01:13:41.559 --> 01:13:44.255
He's been living underneath
this fucking house...

01:13:44.361 --> 01:13:45.919
for who knows how long.

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:47.930
Probably the last 20 years.

01:13:47.998 --> 01:13:49.295
Come on.

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:56.365
I swear on my soul...

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.874
I had no idea.

01:13:58.943 --> 01:14:00.843
I swear.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.449
Aw, shit.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.488
Come on. Let's go.

01:14:14.692 --> 01:14:17.286
Oh, my God.
He cut the cable.

01:14:17.394 --> 01:14:19.988
Where the fuck is he?

01:14:21.799 --> 01:14:23.426
This is bad.

01:14:25.136 --> 01:14:29.368
Deckard, where is he?

01:14:38.883 --> 01:14:41.681
- No!
- Run! Oh!

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.463
Aah!

01:15:00.971 --> 01:15:02.302
No.

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.053
Uhh.

01:15:52.957 --> 01:15:54.925
Oh, no.

01:16:20.517 --> 01:16:22.382
Aaaah!

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.251
Uhh!

01:16:47.011 --> 01:16:48.808
Aah!

01:16:48.879 --> 01:16:50.710
Aah!

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:05.421
Uhh.

01:17:57.448 --> 01:17:59.006
You bastard!

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:01.381
This is for Jen!

01:18:03.354 --> 01:18:04.480
This is for Rudy!

01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:09.984
For all of them!

01:18:22.106 --> 01:18:23.403
Oh, shit.

01:18:28.879 --> 01:18:30.039
Aah!

01:18:35.152 --> 01:18:37.416
Aah!

01:19:44.354 --> 01:19:47.619
Trick or treat, motherfucker.

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:52.253
Aaaah!

01:20:04.274 --> 01:20:05.434
No!

01:20:06.577 --> 01:20:08.135
No!

01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:09.338
Aah!

01:20:26.063 --> 01:20:27.690
Uhh!

01:20:27.764 --> 01:20:28.890
Aaah!

01:20:28.966 --> 01:20:30.558
Ohh!

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:47.511
Burn, motherfucker! Burn!

01:20:49.253 --> 01:20:51.221
Sara!

01:20:53.524 --> 01:20:55.185
Come on, come on!

01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:56.452
Uhh!

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.961
Hey, Mikey!
Happy fucking Halloween!

01:21:49.846 --> 01:21:52.610
Sara? Sara Moyer?

01:21:52.683 --> 01:21:55.618
- Sara?
- Can we get a statement?

01:21:55.686 --> 01:21:57.210
Hey, we can go live now.

01:21:57.287 --> 01:21:59.448
What happened
with Michael Myers?

01:21:59.523 --> 01:22:03.015
Thank you, Deckard.
You saved my life.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.333
What's it feel like
to be a hero, Sara?

01:22:13.403 --> 01:22:15.132
How does it feel now
that it's all over?

01:22:15.205 --> 01:22:17.139
What makes you so sure
it's over?

01:22:17.207 --> 01:22:18.435
Excuse me.

01:22:18.508 --> 01:22:20.738
- Watch the camera!
- No more cameras!

01:22:20.777 --> 01:22:23.302
Dangertainment
is off the air.

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:25.211
Why don't
y'all show some respect?

01:22:25.282 --> 01:22:27.147
Mr. Harris, would you like
to make a statement?

01:22:27.217 --> 01:22:28.980
What can you tell us
about Michael Myers?

01:22:29.052 --> 01:22:31.646
Michael Myers
is not a sound bite...

01:22:31.722 --> 01:22:36.284
a spin-off, a tie-in,
some celebrity scandal.

01:22:36.393 --> 01:22:41.592
Michael Myers is a killer shark
in baggy-ass overalls...

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.428
that gets his kicks
off of killing...

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.968
everything and everyone
that he comes across.

01:22:46.036 --> 01:22:47.970
That's all.

01:22:48.038 --> 01:22:50.404
We're done dancing
for these cameras.

01:22:50.474 --> 01:22:51.941
Let's get outta here, Sara.

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:54.876
But how are you
feeling right now?

01:22:54.911 --> 01:22:56.742
Heh.

01:22:56.813 --> 01:22:58.007
How am I feelin' now?

01:22:58.081 --> 01:23:00.845
You wanna know how
I'm feelin' right now?

01:23:00.917 --> 01:23:02.179
Feel this!

01:23:02.252 --> 01:23:04.447
My camera!

01:23:14.631 --> 01:23:16.064
That's him, isn't it?

01:23:16.133 --> 01:23:18.192
I want to see his face.

01:23:18.268 --> 01:23:23.228
I want to warn you, ma'am,
it's not a pretty sight.

01:23:26.076 --> 01:23:28.510
All right.

01:23:37.521 --> 01:23:38.818
Come on, back it off.
Let's go.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:40.186
Wow.

01:23:40.257 --> 01:23:42.817
You're lookin' a little crispy
over there, Mikey.

01:23:42.926 --> 01:23:45.622
Like some chicken-fried
motherfucker.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:50.393
Well, may he never,
ever rest in peace.

01:24:00.377 --> 01:24:02.402
Hey, how's it going?

01:24:02.479 --> 01:24:04.310
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:24:04.381 --> 01:24:05.780
Another one?

01:24:05.849 --> 01:24:07.282
It's your lucky night.

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:08.715
You got a celebrity.

01:24:08.785 --> 01:24:11.811
Ooh, let me get
my autograph book.

01:24:11.888 --> 01:24:15.051
I'm not kidding.
It's Michael Myers.

01:24:15.158 --> 01:24:16.352
What?

01:24:19.963 --> 01:24:22.397
Get me a copy
of that autograph.

01:24:22.466 --> 01:24:23.899
