WEBVTT

00:12.900 --> 00:14.833
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.867 --> 00:16.167
YOU CAN'T HELP HER NOW.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.333
YOU DON'T ASK A LOT
OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS,

00:18.367 --> 00:21.033
AND YOU'RE VERY HARD
TO GET TO KNOW.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.500
YES.

00:22.533 --> 00:25.267
WITH YOUR REPUTATION,
SEATTLE GRACE WILL BECOME ONE OF

00:25.300 --> 00:27.467
THE FOREMOST NEONATAL HOSPITALS
WEST OF MANHATTAN.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.033
WE GOT A THIRD TRIMESTER
BURN VICTIM HERE.

00:29.067 --> 00:31.467
DR. BAILEY,
I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.833
YOU SHOW A REAL GIFT
WITH MY SPECIALTY,

00:32.867 --> 00:34.833
I'M GOING TO BE STAYING
IN TOWN FOR AWHILE.

00:34.867 --> 00:36.533
GOOD-BYE, DEREK.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.233
GOOD-BYE, MEREDITH.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.800
DO YOU WANT TO BUY ME
A DRINK?

00:43.833 --> 00:46.733
(laughing)

00:51.233 --> 00:52.467
(Meredith)
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

00:52.500 --> 00:55.300
IT WAS HALLOWEEN CANDY.

01:00.167 --> 01:04.333
YOU HID IT FROM YOUR PARENTS
AND ATE IT UNTIL YOU GOT SICK.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.533
SO THIS IS...
WHERE YOU LIVE?

01:10.567 --> 01:13.467
(laughing)

01:13.500 --> 01:15.400
IN COLLEGE,
IT WAS THE HEADY COMBO

01:15.433 --> 01:19.133
OF YOUTH, TEQUILA AND WELL...
YOU KNOW.

01:19.167 --> 01:20.467
(laughs)

01:23.600 --> 01:26.133
AS A SURGEON, YOU TAKE
AS MUCH OF THE GOOD

01:26.167 --> 01:28.467
AS YOU CAN GET...

01:41.533 --> 01:43.167
AHH.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.333
'CAUSE GOOD THINGS
AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.400
THAT WAS AMAZING.

01:49.433 --> 01:50.833
YEAH.
YEAH.

01:50.867 --> 01:52.367
TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING--

01:52.400 --> 01:54.067
EVEN LOVE--

01:54.067 --> 01:55.800
IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD THING.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.700
DID YOU...

01:57.733 --> 02:00.767
YEAH, I DID.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.800
(Meredith)
THERE'S A BOY IN MY BED.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.733
(Cristina)
What's his name?

02:05.767 --> 02:07.633
UM, STEVE.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.167
WHERE'D YOU FIND HIM?

02:09.200 --> 02:10.133
Joe's.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.767
MM. GUESS WHERE I AM.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.267
Where?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.633
BURKE'S APARTMENT.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.633
HE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.167
HE LEFT ME HERE ALONE.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.400
You're going through
his stuff, aren't you?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.333
OH, THERE'S NO STUFF
TO GO THROUGH.

02:23.367 --> 02:24.700
IT'S A FREAK SHOW.

02:24.733 --> 02:26.633
I MEAN, YOU COULD DO SURGERY
IN HERE.

02:26.667 --> 02:30.067
OH...

02:30.100 --> 02:33.733
HE ARRANGED HIS BOOKS
USING THE DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.133
MER, I'M SCARED.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.600
GET OUT.
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE NOW.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.333
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

02:39.367 --> 02:43.067
UH, I-I GOTTA GO.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.100
UH...

02:46.133 --> 02:48.333
I HAVE TO GO
TAKE A SHOWER.

02:48.367 --> 02:50.267
AND WHEN I GET BACK,
YOU WON'T BE HERE.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.200
SO, UM, GOOD-BYE, STEVE.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.600
(jingling)

03:11.833 --> 03:13.700
WELL, ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT
IN SEATTLE.

03:13.733 --> 03:16.467
YEAH, WHO WAS IT THIS TIME?
HAIRY BACK GUY?

03:16.500 --> 03:17.833
YOU KNOW WHO I MISS?

03:17.867 --> 03:19.733
INAPPROPRIATE
FACIAL HAIR GUY.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.700
YOU KNOW HE DID
HIS OWN DISHES?

03:21.733 --> 03:24.300
TATTOOED ASS GUY
MADE COFFEE.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.133
YEAH, HE WAS A KEEPER.

03:27.167 --> 03:28.767
WHAT?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.100
MEREDITH?

03:30.133 --> 03:32.067
I AM OVER HER.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.567
OKAY.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.200
I AM.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.700
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

03:36.733 --> 03:39.200
ALTHOUGH, IS SHE TRYING
TO SET SOME KIND OF RECORD?

03:39.233 --> 03:41.400
AT LEAST SHE HAS A GOAL.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.300
OH.
OH.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.667
OH, HE'S NEW.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.700
AND I SHALL NAME HIM
RUNNING GUY.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.067
YOU KNOW WHO I HEARD ALEX
COME HOME WITH LAST NIGHT?

03:52.067 --> 03:53.067
YOU.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.067
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.
(chuckles)

03:55.067 --> 03:56.800
ACTUALLY, I REALLY DO
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

03:56.833 --> 03:58.733
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT

03:58.767 --> 04:01.367
BECAUSE THERE WERE...
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.500
WHAT?

04:02.533 --> 04:05.067
YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T--
HE--IT WAS...

04:05.067 --> 04:07.400
NO. (chuckles)
STOP IT.

04:07.433 --> 04:09.067
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.100
(laughs)
GEORGE, STOP IT.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.467
I--I'M GONNA AT LEAST

04:12.500 --> 04:14.467
THINK ABOUT MAKING FUN OF HIM
NEXT TIME I SEE HIM.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.367
HE SAID
IT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.500
OH, THAT'S WHAT WE ALL SAY.

04:18.533 --> 04:21.167
AND I MEAN THEY.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.533
I DON'T KNOW.

04:22.567 --> 04:25.067
MAYBE THIS RELATIONSHIP
JUST ISN'T MEANT TO BE.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.600
I MEAN, I JUST...

04:26.633 --> 04:28.700
JUST NEED SOME SEX,
GEORGE.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.233
YOU KNOW? I JUST--

04:30.267 --> 04:33.567
I NEED SEX NOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:33.600 --> 04:36.633
NO MATTER
HOW HARD YOU BEG...

04:36.667 --> 04:39.500
I AM NOT DOING YOU.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.533
NICE TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.067
THANK YOU, PATRICIA.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.067
AHEM.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.700
YOUR OWN SERVICE,

04:51.733 --> 04:53.667
STATE-OF-THE-ART NICU

04:53.700 --> 04:55.600
AND A SALARY
THAT'LL MAKE YOU ONE OF

04:55.633 --> 04:58.067
THE HIGHEST PAID SURGEONS
IN THE NORTHWEST.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.567
YOU BETTER BE WORTH IT.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.433
QUINTUPLETS, RICHARD.
THAT'S A GO?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.067
THE MOTHER-TO-BE
CHECKED IN THIS MORNING.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.267
NOTHING I LIKE MORE
THAN A HIGH-PROFILE CASE.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.633
WELL, DON'T GO CALLING
THE PRESS IN YET.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.167
IT'S AN EXTREMELY
HIGH RISK PREGNANCY.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.633
AT LEAST THREE OF THE BABIES
ARE SURGICAL.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.833
IN FACT, I'M GONNA NEED TO PULL
PEOPLE FROM ALL DEPARTMENTS.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.367
YOU'RE MY STAR.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.367
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.300
IS THERE MEAL SERVICE
ON THIS FLIGHT?

05:18.333 --> 05:20.267
ROBERT MARTIN, 45,
COLLAPSED AND HIT HIS HEAD,

05:20.300 --> 05:22.467
CAUSING A SMALL
SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.067
ALSO PRESENTS WITH UNCONTROLLED
EYE MOVEMENT AND DELIRIUM.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.800
HIS ALCOHOL AND TOX SCREENS
WERE NEGATIVE,

05:26.833 --> 05:28.733
BUT HIS SODIUM LEVELS
ARE 112.

05:28.767 --> 05:30.667
A LITTLE TOO LOW
FOR MY TASTES.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.200
(Robert) Hey. Hey!

05:32.233 --> 05:34.067
MR. MARTIN, HOW YOU DOING
IN THERE?

05:34.100 --> 05:37.200
I'm still waiting on that drink.
Are you the stewardess?

05:37.233 --> 05:39.133
WE'RE CALLED
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS NOW.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.367
Hey!

05:40.400 --> 05:42.533
HEY!
OH, THERE IT IS
RIGHT THERE.

05:42.567 --> 05:44.433
ON HIS PITUITARY.
IT'S A RATHKE'S CLEFT CYST.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.200
SO HE'S HYPONATREMIC.
YEAH.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.133
EXCESSIVE THIRST IS
A COMMON SIDE EFFECT.

05:48.167 --> 05:50.067
THE WATER'S WHAT'S BEEN
SCREWING UP HIS SODIUM LEVEL.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.433
IT'S CAUSING HIS DELIRIUM.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.333
SO HOW DO YOU TREAT
HYPONATREMIA?

05:53.367 --> 05:54.700
UH, 3% HYPERTONIC SALINE
SOLUTION I.V.,

05:54.733 --> 05:56.233
300 cc's OVER 3 HOURS.

05:56.267 --> 05:58.167
GREAT.
GET HIM BACK TO HIS ROOM.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.100
CALL ME WHEN HE STABILIZES.
NICELY DONE, DR. KAREV.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.133
Hey!

06:01.167 --> 06:03.133
WHEN DOES THE MOVIE START?

06:03.167 --> 06:04.300
DORIE, THIS IS DR. STEVENS.

06:04.333 --> 06:07.167
SHE'LL BE WORKING WITH US
ON THIS CASE.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.767
OH, THE MORE THE MERRIER.
APPARENTLY.
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?

06:08.800 --> 06:10.100
32 WEEKS.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.067
AND HOW LONG IS
A NORMAL GESTATION PERIOD?

06:12.067 --> 06:13.567
40 WEEKS, BUT WITH TWINS,

06:13.600 --> 06:15.467
36 WEEKS IS CONSIDERED
FULL TERM.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.100
SO WITH QUINTS, 34 WEEKS IS
CONSIDERED EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.067
WELL, JUST GIVE THEM
SOME ACETAMINOPHEN.

06:20.067 --> 06:21.767
IT'S IN THE MEDICINE CABINET.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.133
I PLAN ON GOING 36 WEEKS.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.800
NO ONE'S LEAVING THIS UTERUS
UNTIL I SAY SO.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.367
THE POWER
OF POSITIVE THINKING, HUH?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.733
WELL, THAT, BED REST

06:28.767 --> 06:31.533
AND ALL THE MEDICAL CARE
YOU CAN GIVE ME.

06:31.567 --> 06:34.433
WE'RE WITH THE DOCTORS NOW,
SO I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

06:34.467 --> 06:35.667
OKAY, BYE.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.200
UH, ADAM'S GOT A FEVER,

06:37.233 --> 06:39.400
WHICH MEANS
SOON THEY'LL ALL HAVE A FEVER.

06:39.433 --> 06:42.133
I DON'T THINK MY MOM'S
GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH LUNCH.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.567
WE HAVE 4-YEAR-OLD BOYS
AT HOME--

06:44.600 --> 06:46.700
ADAM, OLIVER AND GRAHAM.
TRIPLETS? YOU--YOU ALREADY
HAVE TRIPLETS?

06:46.733 --> 06:49.067
OH, I GUESS WHEN YOU TAKE
THOSE FERTILITY PILLS,

06:49.067 --> 06:51.067
YOU SHOULD READ
THE FINE PRINT.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.500
DR. STEVENS.

06:52.533 --> 06:54.467
OH, I'M SORRY.
I JUST, I MEANT IT AS A--

06:54.500 --> 06:57.333
IT'S OKAY. I'M USED TO IT.
I JUST REALLY WANTED A GIRL.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.267
YEAH, WE JUST DIDN'T BANK
ON FIVE GIRLS.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.700
BUT THINK OF ALL THE CLOTHES
AND ALL THAT PINK CUTENESS.

07:02.733 --> 07:04.633
HONEY, THAT'S
YOUR HAPPY PLACE, REMEMBER?

07:04.667 --> 07:07.267
OH, YEAH.

07:07.300 --> 07:11.400
TRY NOT TO SAY EVERYTHING
THAT POPS INTO YOUR BRAIN.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.733
(sighs) THEY ALWAYS LOOK
SO SAD WHEN I KICK THEM OUT.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.367
(Both laugh)

07:19.400 --> 07:21.533
SERIOUSLY,
WHY DO GUYS NOT UNDERSTAND

07:21.567 --> 07:23.467
THAT WHEN YOU PICK THEM UP
IN A BAR

07:23.500 --> 07:25.167
AND TAKE THEM HOME FOR SEX

07:25.200 --> 07:27.433
THAT THERE ARE NO PICKET FENCES
OR KIDS IN YOUR FUTURE?

07:27.467 --> 07:29.067
AHEM.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.667
BURKE KEYED YOU?

07:32.700 --> 07:34.367
I GOT FREAKIN' KEYED
BEFORE COFFEE.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.300
OH, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM?

07:36.333 --> 07:38.600
THEY'RE LIKE
THESE 1950s DEBUTANTES,

07:38.633 --> 07:41.067
ONE DANCE, AND THERE'S
A SHOTGUN TO YOUR HEAD.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.067
MEREDITH.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.133
YOU WORK HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
STEVE?

07:49.167 --> 07:51.067
I'M HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM.

07:51.067 --> 07:52.067
"STEVE" STEVE?

07:52.067 --> 07:55.467
ACTUALLY, I'M HAVING
A BIG PROBLEM.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.433
WHAT?

07:56.467 --> 07:58.600
STEVE, HI. CRISTINA.

07:59.667 --> 08:04.400
EVER SINCE YOU AND I...
IT WON'T GO AWAY.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.567
CRISTINA!

08:06.600 --> 08:08.333
WHAT? IT'S RIGHT THERE
LOOKING AT ME.

08:10.733 --> 08:16.767
OH, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
I COULD SAY RIGHT NOW.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.300
CHAMP.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.533
***

08:22.567 --> 08:27.167
(Woman) * NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THEY MIGHT END UP *

08:27.200 --> 08:30.200
* NOBODY KNOWS

08:40.833 --> 08:42.633
* OH, OH

08:42.667 --> 08:46.533
* SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

08:49.133 --> 08:50.733
DO YOU THINK IT'S SERIOUS?

08:50.767 --> 08:52.667
IT HURTS LIKE IT'S SERIOUS.
YOU REALIZE THIS IS
COMPLETELY INSANE?

08:52.700 --> 08:54.600
LOOK, WE HAVE TO
STASH HIM SOMEWHERE

08:54.633 --> 08:56.533
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.233
I CAN'T HAVE THE WHOLE HOSPITAL
FINDING OUT.
I'M NOT GOING DOWN
FOR THIS.

08:59.267 --> 09:01.167
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU BROKE THIS GUY'S PENIS.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.367
BROKE HIS WHAT?
COME--HEY, HEY.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.800
DON'T MAKE ME CHASE YOU DOWN.
I'M GROWIN' A PERSON HERE.

09:04.833 --> 09:08.133
I GOTTA CHECK
ON SOME LABS.

09:16.833 --> 09:19.267
HOW'S IT LOOK?

09:19.300 --> 09:20.633
NOT BAD.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.167
NOT BAD?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.533
NOT BAD IS PRETTY GOOD

09:23.567 --> 09:26.200
WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE BABIES
IN YOUR UTERUS.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.333
OH.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.367
IT'S KATE.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.367
SHE KICKS ME SO HARD.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.700
IT'S LIKE A BELLY BURN
EVERY TIME.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.667
YOU'VE NAMED THEM ALREADY?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.200
I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY.

09:37.233 --> 09:39.067
OR MAYBE JUST
A LITTLE BIT STUPID?

09:39.067 --> 09:40.400
MRS. RUSSELL, I'M SORRY

09:40.433 --> 09:42.067
IF I'VE DONE SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.800
THE ONLY THING
THAT WILL OFFEND ME

09:43.833 --> 09:45.733
IS IF YOU PRETEND THAT YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN JUDGING ME

09:45.767 --> 09:48.300
SINCE THE MINUTE WE MET.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.200
WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER,

09:50.233 --> 09:52.567
SO WE MAY AS WELL
BE HONEST, RIGHT?

09:55.467 --> 09:57.667
IF YOU HAD REDUCED THE FETUSES
EVEN BY TWO,

09:57.700 --> 09:59.600
THE OTHER THREE COULD'VE BEEN
CARRIED LONGER,

09:59.633 --> 10:02.200
BEEN MORE DEVELOPED
AND BORN HEALTHIER.

10:02.233 --> 10:05.433
AND YOU'RE ABOUT THE 16th DOCTOR
WHO'S TOLD ME THAT.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.100
THIS ONE UP HERE...

10:12.133 --> 10:13.467
THIS IS CHARLOTTE.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.533
SHE'S THE STUBBORN ONE.

10:15.567 --> 10:18.833
LODGED INTO MY RIB CAGE,
WON'T BUDGE.

10:18.867 --> 10:21.167
AND OVER HERE...

10:21.200 --> 10:22.300
LUCY.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.233
SHE'S A BAD ASS.

10:24.267 --> 10:27.700
SHE GETS KICKED,
SHE KICKS BACK.

10:27.733 --> 10:29.267
EMILY.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.567
(chuckles) SHE HAS THE HICCUPS
ALMOST EVERY DAY.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.567
(Both laugh)

10:34.600 --> 10:36.500
AND OVER HERE IS JULIE.
SHE'S PRETTY MELLOW.

10:36.533 --> 10:39.033
EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE,
SHE JUST TURNS OVER.

10:39.067 --> 10:43.267
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO...

10:43.300 --> 10:45.300
KATE.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.467
WHO GIVES YOU BELLY BURN.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.167
EVERY TIME SHE KICKS.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.200
WE WERE JUST BRINGING HIM
UP HERE

10:53.233 --> 10:56.167
BECAUSE HE'S GOT THIS...
PROBLEM, YOU SEE.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.200
AND HE'S A-A FRIEND.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.800
WHAT DID YOUR FRIEND TAKE?

11:01.833 --> 11:04.167
TAKE?
WHICH
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION DRUG?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.067
YOU TOOK...
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I SWEAR.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.833
IT WAS ALL NATURAL
BETWEEN US.
SHUT UP.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.667
YOUR CONDITION
IS CALLED PRIAPISM,

11:10.700 --> 11:13.800
USUALLY BROUGHT ON BY
THE OVERUSE OF E.D.s.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.367
I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.300
WELL, WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR IT

11:17.333 --> 11:19.433
BECAUSE THERE'S NO TEST
TO SEE IF YOU'RE LYING.

11:19.467 --> 11:21.433
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK
FOR OTHER CAUSES.

11:21.467 --> 11:22.800
THERE'LL BE LOTS OF LABS.

11:22.833 --> 11:25.233
LOTS OF... PROCEDURES--

11:25.267 --> 11:26.467
PAINFUL PROCEDURES--

11:26.500 --> 11:29.333
PROCEDURES WHICH MIGHT MAKE YOU
WISH YOU NEVER HAD A PENIS.

11:29.367 --> 11:31.533
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE YOUR STORY?

11:31.567 --> 11:33.700
I SWEAR, I'M CLEAN.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.633
ALL RIGHT.
GREY, START HIS WORK-UP.

11:35.667 --> 11:39.267
GET SOME BLOOD, GET HIM
SOME MEPERIDINE FOR HIS PAIN.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.167
AS OF NOW, YOUR FRIEND
IS ADMITTED.

11:43.533 --> 11:45.433
DORIE RUSSELL--
SHE'S GIVING BIRTH TO QUINTS.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.367
YES, RICHARD SAID
WE WERE ON STANDBY,

11:47.400 --> 11:49.333
WHICH IS NO PROBLEM, REALLY,
'CAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE

11:49.367 --> 11:52.300
A NEUROSURGERY DEPARTMENT
TO RUN OR ANYTHING.
AWW.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.533
YES, APPARENTLY OUR DEPARTMENTS
ARE AT HER DISPOSAL.
MM-HMM.

11:54.567 --> 11:56.467
DO YOU HAVE TIME TO TALK
TO THE MOM NOW?

11:56.500 --> 11:59.467
I WANT HER TO MEET
ALL THE SURGEONS ON HER TEAM.
YES, NO PROBLEM.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.400
I'LL COME BY AFTER I GET
OUT OF THE O.R.

12:01.433 --> 12:02.733
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.
SURE.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.300
OKAY...

12:04.333 --> 12:06.233
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU LEAVE
THE HOTEL ROOM THIS MORNING.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.600
I MISSED YOU AT BREAKFAST.

12:07.633 --> 12:09.133
I HAD AN EARLY SURGERY.

12:09.167 --> 12:11.067
YOU SURE THAT'S ALL?
NOTHING'S WRONG?

12:11.067 --> 12:13.767
NO, IT'S LIKE I SAID.
I JUST HAD AN EARLY SURGERY.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.067
OKAY.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.833
I FEEL LIKE A BEACHED WHALE.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.733
DORIE, THIS IS DR. SHEPHERD.
HE'S OUR HEAD OF NEUROSURGERY.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.833
HI, DORIE.
HI. ANOTHER DR. SHEPHERD.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.300
HE'S MY HUSBAND, ACTUALLY.
SERIOUSLY?

12:24.333 --> 12:25.400
MM-HMM.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.133
WOW. LOOK AT YOU TWO.

12:27.167 --> 12:28.600
EVERYBODY MUST HATE YOU.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.567
(Both) OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.833
ANYWAY, DORIE,

12:31.867 --> 12:33.700
DR. SHEPHERD WANTS TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT BABY C.

12:33.733 --> 12:36.667
LUCY.
YES, LUCY HAS A CONDITION
CALLED HYDROCEPHALUS.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.533
IT IS A BUILDUP

12:38.567 --> 12:40.433
OF CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID
ON THE BRAIN.

12:40.467 --> 12:41.500
OKAY, AND THAT MEANS...

12:41.533 --> 12:43.133
EXCESS FLUID BUILDS UP

12:43.167 --> 12:45.067
AND IT PUTS PRESSURE
ON THE BABY'S BRAIN,

12:45.100 --> 12:47.267
WHICH COULD RESULT
IN BRIAN DAMAGE.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.500
HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.
WE CAUGHT IT EARLY ENOUGH.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.100
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF IT
VERY QUICKLY.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.600
HOW?

12:53.633 --> 12:55.533
I'M GOING TO INSTALL A SHUNT
TO DRAIN THE FLUID.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.467
BARRING ANY COMPLICATIONS,

12:57.500 --> 12:58.700
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A FULL RECOVERY.

12:58.733 --> 13:00.567
NO BRAIN DAMAGE?
NO BRAIN DAMAGE.

13:02.233 --> 13:03.833
OKAY, REALLY...

13:03.867 --> 13:05.733
COULDN'T YOU HAVE LED
WITH THAT?

13:05.767 --> 13:07.833
GOOD POINT.

13:07.867 --> 13:10.533
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

13:10.567 --> 13:12.300
IT'S A KEY.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.400
WHY?
WHY IS IT A KEY?

13:14.433 --> 13:16.833
ARE WE FEELING EXISTENTIAL
THIS MORNING?

13:16.867 --> 13:20.300
WELL, IF A KEY TURNS IN A LOCK
AND NO ONE ASKED FOR THE KEY

13:20.333 --> 13:21.667
OR EVEN WANTED THE KEY,

13:21.700 --> 13:23.200
DOES IT MAKE A SOUND?

13:23.233 --> 13:24.633
(Meredith) HEY.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.133
HEY.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.067
I'M GOING TO TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

13:28.100 --> 13:31.300
TO BE SOMEPLACE ELSE.

13:32.700 --> 13:36.100
STEVE'S LABS CAME BACK CLEAN.
SO?

13:36.133 --> 13:38.433
SO SOMEONE NEEDS TO INDUCE
VASOCONSTRICTION.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.333
OH, NICE TRY
WITH THE FANCY WORD.

13:40.367 --> 13:42.167
HE NEEDS AN ENEMA,
AND THE ANSWER IS NO.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.367
I CAN'T DO IT.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.767
OH, COME ON.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.733
YOU LET A GUY YOU PICK UP
IN A BAR SEE YOU NAKED,

13:46.767 --> 13:49.467
AND YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM
AN ENEMA?
TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.633
WELL, I AM KEYED UP
AND CRANKY.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.567
I WOULD DO IT FOR YOU.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.633
OH, REALLY?
YOU'D GIVE BURKE AN ENEMA?

13:55.667 --> 13:57.167
YES.
UH-HUH.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.533
MAYBE.
MM-HMM.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.467
NO, BUT THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.467
OH, YEAH. OKAY.
HERE'S HOW IT GOES.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.133
I DO THIS FOR YOU,
AND YOU DO

14:04.167 --> 14:06.133
EVERY ENEMA I'M ASSIGNED TO
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH.
DEAL.

14:06.167 --> 14:08.433
WOW, YOU REALLY DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.100
HAVE WE HEARD
FROM THE SELLER'S AGENT?

14:14.133 --> 14:16.100
I'VE BEEN CALLING
ALL MORNING.

14:16.133 --> 14:19.233
AH, MR. MARTIN. IT'S GOOD TO
SEE YOU BACK ON SOLID GROUND.

14:19.267 --> 14:20.733
I'M DR. SHEPHERD.
MY ASSISTANT DOYLE SAYS

14:20.767 --> 14:22.667
I PASSED OUT AND HIT MY HEAD.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.500
THIS GUY SAYS
IT'S SOME KIND OF CYST.

14:24.533 --> 14:27.267
I WANT YOU TO SAY
WHEN I CAN GET OUT OF HERE.
A RATHKE'S CLEFT CYST.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.233
WHATEVER.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.300
IT'S A CONGENITAL TUMOR
ON YOUR PITUITARY.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.333
THAT'S TREATABLE, RIGHT?
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SURGERY.

14:32.367 --> 14:34.200
SEE, I'M GOING TO USE
AN ENDONASAL APPROACH.

14:34.233 --> 14:35.733
ENDONASAL?
MM-HMM.

14:35.767 --> 14:38.100
YOU'RE GONNA PULL IT OUT
THROUGH MY NOSE?
MM-HMM.

14:38.133 --> 14:39.667
LOOK HIM UP.
CHECK HIS CREDENTIALS.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.767
IT'S A MINIMALLY INVASIVE
PROCEDURE,

14:41.800 --> 14:44.467
SO THERE WON'T BE
ANY SCARING.
GOOD. SO WHEN?

14:44.500 --> 14:47.067
ONCE WE FULLY STABILIZE
YOUR SODIUM LEVELS.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.833
THAT MEANS NO MORE WATER.
I'M THIRSTY.

14:48.867 --> 14:50.767
IT'S A SIDE EFFECT
OF THE TUMOR.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.300
WE'LL KEEP YOU HYDRATED
INTRAVENOUSLY.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.100
RIGHT. OKAY?

14:55.133 --> 14:57.133
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

14:57.167 --> 14:59.167
I'M JUST FOLLOWING
THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.767
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.133
TRY BEING ME.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.067
I MEAN,
YOU MEET SOMEONE IN A BAR,

15:10.100 --> 15:11.533
YOU HAVE A FEW DRINKS,
A FEW LAUGHS,

15:11.567 --> 15:13.200
YOU MAKE OUT IN THE CAR.

15:13.233 --> 15:16.800
ROLL OVER TO YOUR SIDE.
OTHER SIDE.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.833
BRING YOUR KNEES UP
TO YOUR CHEST.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.200
YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME.

15:20.233 --> 15:22.133
SPEND THE NIGHT,
WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING

15:22.167 --> 15:23.800
AND--OKAY!

15:23.833 --> 15:25.400
MM-HMM.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.767
SO YOU'RE STILL
NOT TALKING TO ME?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.767
YOU GAVE ME SYPHILIS.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.300
AND I AM TALKING TO YOU,

15:38.333 --> 15:40.700
I JUST DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.167
HOW'S GEORGE?

15:44.200 --> 15:45.533
O'MALLEY'S A FETUS.

15:45.567 --> 15:48.100
HE'S ALL WHINEY
AND AFRAID OF THE LIGHT.

15:48.133 --> 15:50.200
SO YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
YOU WERE DOING ME, BIG DEAL.

15:50.233 --> 15:53.233
MINIMAL DISCLOSURE,
THAT'S MY POLICY.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.767
HEY. I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.733
HEY.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.267
I'M ON THE QUINTS CASE.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.733
YEAH, I HEARD.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.267
YEAH, THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

16:06.300 --> 16:07.633
MULTIPLE SURGERIES
ONCE THEY'RE DELIVERED.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.300
I PUT YOU ON THE PAGER LIST,
SO YOU'RE IN, TOO.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.233
YEAH, I KIND OF GOT
MY OWN CASES

16:12.267 --> 16:13.700
TO WORRY ABOUT, SO...

16:13.733 --> 16:16.100
OKAY, ALEX... WAS IT ME?

16:16.133 --> 16:19.333
BECAUSE WE SEEMED TO BE
ACTUALLY HAVING A NORMAL TIME,

16:19.367 --> 16:20.533
A GOOD TIME.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.467
YEAH, WE WERE HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.667
WELL, THEN WAS IT ME?
WAS IT SOMETHING I DID OR...

16:25.700 --> 16:27.833
LOOK, IT WASN'T YOU, OKAY?

16:27.867 --> 16:29.200
IT WAS JUST...

16:29.233 --> 16:31.133
I JUST DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE DOING IT.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.067
I WAS TIRED, YOU KNOW?

16:33.100 --> 16:36.333
WELL, DO YOU FEEL LIKE
DOING IT TONIGHT?

16:36.367 --> 16:38.333
WELL...

16:38.367 --> 16:40.533
I'M ON CALL, SO...

16:40.567 --> 16:43.833
OKAY. WELL...

16:43.867 --> 16:47.333
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
DOING IT NOW?

16:47.367 --> 16:49.300
WHAT, RIGHT NOW?

16:49.333 --> 16:52.267
PEOPLE HAVE SEX
IN THIS HOSPITAL ALL THE TIME.

17:03.867 --> 17:06.800
YOU HEAR ABOUT THE QUINTS?

17:06.833 --> 17:09.133
YEAH, I HEARD.

17:09.167 --> 17:10.800
YEAH. I GOT TO
GET IN ON THAT.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.333
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S ADDISON.

17:12.367 --> 17:14.633
SO I'M GUESSING
I DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.367
SO HOW DO YOU BREAK
A GUY'S PENIS?

17:20.667 --> 17:22.367
YOU KNOW ABOUT STEVE?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.300
WHY DOES EVERY GUY
I MEET

17:24.333 --> 17:27.800
COME WITH HIS OWN UNIQUE SET
OF NIGHTMARISH HUMILIATIONS?

17:27.833 --> 17:28.767
UM...

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
MAYBE IT'S A MATTER
OF VOLUME?

17:30.833 --> 17:32.667
VOLUME? WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

17:32.700 --> 17:35.767
JUST, YOU KNOW, THERE'S QUALITY
AND THEN THERE'S QUANTITY.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.100
SO YOU THINK I'M SLEEPING
WITH TOO MANY GUYS?

17:38.133 --> 17:40.067
YOU THINK
I'M SOME KIND OF SLUT?

17:40.067 --> 17:42.267
I THINK YOU'RE TAKING
SOME RISKS.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.200
I THINK YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
IN A HOLE IN SOME GUY'S BASEMENT

17:44.233 --> 17:46.133
BEING ORDERED TO PUT
THE LOTION ON THE SKIN

17:46.167 --> 17:48.067
OR ELSE YOU'LL GET
THE HOSE AGAIN.
OH, COME ON.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.600
I THINK--
EXCUSE ME. I'M TALKING.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.200
SO YOU'RE NOT OVER DEREK.
YOU WANT TO BE, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.133
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND
SOME REPLACEMENT,

17:54.167 --> 17:56.067
SOME TEMPORARY WAY
TO FEEL BETTER,

17:56.100 --> 17:58.133
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK

17:58.167 --> 18:00.067
BECAUSE A FUTURE OF
MEANINGLESS ONE-NIGHT STANDS

18:00.067 --> 18:02.100
AND PROBLEMATIC PENISES
IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT.

18:02.133 --> 18:04.367
YOU WANT BETTER,

18:04.400 --> 18:06.400
AND YOU DESERVE BETTER.

18:07.867 --> 18:11.567
AND NOT EVERY GUY'S
A NIGHTMARE.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.467
OH.

18:16.267 --> 18:18.800
IF IT'S ME,
JUST TELL ME IT'S ME.

18:18.833 --> 18:19.767
IT'S NOT YOU.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.100
WELL, THEN IS IT
A MEDICAL THING

18:22.133 --> 18:24.067
OR--OR A PROBLEM?

18:24.067 --> 18:25.667
BECAUSE GUYS
HAVE PROBLEMS SOMETIMES.

18:25.700 --> 18:29.133
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.567
GET BACK DOWN HERE.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.067
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
UNTIL WE DO IT.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.433
OKAY.

18:35.467 --> 18:37.733
(giggles)

18:40.367 --> 18:42.067
WHOOP!

18:42.067 --> 18:42.800
(laughs)

18:42.833 --> 18:43.767
WHOOP!

18:43.800 --> 18:44.733
NICE.

18:44.767 --> 18:46.367
(pager beeps)

18:46.400 --> 18:47.633
OH...

18:47.667 --> 18:51.600
9-1-1. I'M SORRY.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.167
DAMN IT.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.300
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

19:05.333 --> 19:07.267
I, UM, I--

19:07.300 --> 19:09.133
THE NURSE WAS HERE.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.067
I'VE LOADED HER UP
WITH MAGNESIUM.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.500
START MONITORING HER
FOR TOXICITY.

19:13.533 --> 19:16.367
OH, IT'S TOO SOON.
THEY CAN'T COME YET.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.600
MOM SAYS
GRAHAM STARTED PUKING.

19:17.633 --> 19:20.733
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:20.767 --> 19:23.567
DORIE'S HAVING CONTRACTIONS.
THE BABIES' VITAL SIGNS
ARE STABLE,

19:23.600 --> 19:25.300
BUT YOUR PLACENTA'S LAYING LOW.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.333
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON THAT.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.167
WE WANT TO KEEP THEM IN THERE
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.100
HOW ARE WE KEEPING THEM IN THERE
IF SHE'S HAVING CONTRACTIONS?

19:31.133 --> 19:32.733
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HON.
THEY CAN STOP THEM.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.667
YOU'RE GONNA
TRENDELENBERG ME, RIGHT?

19:34.700 --> 19:36.800
YES, I AM. YOU'VE DONE
YOUR READING, DORIE.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.467
THEY DID IT WITH THE TRIPLETS.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.367
GRAVITY, REMEMBER, TOM?

19:41.400 --> 19:43.333
IT WORKED FINE THEN,
AND IT'LL BE FINE NOW.

19:43.367 --> 19:44.467
HANG IN THERE, TOM.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.400
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR SECOND THOUGHTS NOW.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.333
WE DIDN'T THINK WE'D SURVIVE
THE FIRST WEEK WITH THE BOYS,

19:48.367 --> 19:50.267
AND WE DID, AND WE'LL BE
THE SAME WITH THE GIRLS.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.167
WE'RE READY.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.200
WELL, THAT'S ALL
WE CAN DO FOR NOW.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.300
DR. STEVENS, ARE YOU
ON CALL TONIGHT?

19:57.333 --> 19:58.767
UM, NO.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.600
YOU ARE NOW.

20:01.633 --> 20:02.767
(sighs)

20:08.800 --> 20:11.067
ENEMA DIDN'T WORK.

20:11.100 --> 20:14.133
ENEMA DIDN'T WORK?
ENEMA DIDN'T WORK.

20:14.167 --> 20:16.733
HUH. WELL, IT WAS
AN EXCELLENT ENEMA.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.300
(Miranda)
SO WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

20:18.333 --> 20:19.833
NEEDLE ASPIRATION.

20:19.867 --> 20:22.033
A NEEDLE?

20:22.067 --> 20:22.800
MY PENIS?

20:22.833 --> 20:24.767
WE HAVE TO DRAIN THE BLOOD.

20:26.633 --> 20:29.300
NO WAY! NO! FORGET IT.

20:29.333 --> 20:30.767
THEN YOU'RE LOOKING
AT IMPOTENCE,

20:30.800 --> 20:33.267
PENILE INFARCTION
OR GANGRENE,

20:33.300 --> 20:34.667
SO IF YOU WANT IT
TO FALL OFF...

20:34.700 --> 20:36.433
NO, NO.
I REALLY DON'T WANT THAT.

20:36.467 --> 20:39.467
THEN LET'S GET TO IT.
WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.667
I FEEL NAUSEOUS.

20:41.700 --> 20:44.033
JUST LIE BACK, CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND TRY TO RELAX.

20:44.067 --> 20:47.000
IF I COULD RELAX,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

20:50.433 --> 20:51.433
HOW IS HE?

20:51.467 --> 20:53.533
WELL, SURGERY'S SCHEDULED
FOR TOMORROW, SO...

20:53.567 --> 20:55.233
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

20:55.267 --> 20:57.400
DON'T LET HIM DRINK ANY WATER,
EVEN IF HE BEGS.

20:57.433 --> 21:00.300
IS THERE ANY FAMILY
WE SHOULD CONTACT, FRIENDS?
NO.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.233
HE DOESN'T REALLY GET ALONG
WELL WITH MOST PEOPLE.

21:02.267 --> 21:05.067
NOT BIG ON THE SOCIAL SKILLS.
SAD GUY.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.833
WELL, HE HAS ME.
THREE YEARS AS HIS ASSISTANT.

21:06.867 --> 21:08.633
I GUESS I'M HIS FRIEND.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.733
DOYLE!

21:16.533 --> 21:18.467
WHAT IF I JUST GAVE HIM
BACK THE KEY?

21:20.167 --> 21:22.333
HE'LL BE HURT.
WHAT IF I DON'T
USE IT?

21:22.367 --> 21:24.733
WELL, THEN, IF YOU HAD
NO INTENTION ON USING IT,

21:24.767 --> 21:26.167
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.367
OH, COME ON.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.300
FISHING A KEY
OUT OF A COFFEE CUP

21:29.333 --> 21:31.100
ISN'T LIKE SOME
BINDING LEGAL CONTRACT

21:31.133 --> 21:33.533
YOUR BOYFRIEND GAVE YOU
A KEY TO HIS PLACE?

21:33.567 --> 21:35.400
WHY IS HE TALKING?

21:35.433 --> 21:36.600
I'M JUST SAYING,

21:36.633 --> 21:38.600
THE GUY PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE.
HE'S TAKING THE NEXT STEP.

21:38.633 --> 21:40.767
YOU CAN'T NOT USE IT.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.433
DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT NOT BE IN
THE BEST POSITION RIGHT NOW

21:43.467 --> 21:46.067
TO BE HANDING OUT
RELATIONSHIP ADVICE?

21:46.067 --> 21:48.467
HEY, HE OFFERED THE KEY.
YOU TOOK THE KEY.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.700
JUST BECAUSE I'M--

21:50.733 --> 21:52.133
LOOK AT THAT.

21:52.167 --> 21:54.067
CONGRATULATIONS.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.833
YOU'RE FLACCID.

21:55.867 --> 21:59.467
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE
SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.167
DORIE? TOM?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.067
HEY, DORIE, TOM,

22:11.067 --> 22:12.667
THIS IS DR. BURKE.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.267
HE'S THE HEAD OF
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

22:14.300 --> 22:15.733
AND DR. O'MALLEY WHO
WILL BE ASSISTING HIM.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.500
DR. BURKE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT EMILY'S HEART SURGERY.

22:18.533 --> 22:20.567
EMILY NEEDS
HEART SURGERY?
YES.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.500
YOUR DAUGHTER
HAS A CONDITION CALLED

22:22.533 --> 22:24.433
HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME.
THE SURGERY WILL BE EXTENSIVE.

22:24.467 --> 22:26.133
AND THE ODDS ARE THAT--

22:26.167 --> 22:29.067
WE DON'T BELIEVE
IN ODDS.
GOOD, NEITHER DO I.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.233
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT YOU BOTH UNDERSTAND

22:30.267 --> 22:31.500
MEDICALLY WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR GIRLS.

22:31.533 --> 22:34.133
AFTER SHE'S BORN, THERE WON'T BE
MUCH TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS SO...

22:34.167 --> 22:35.333
OKAY.

22:35.367 --> 22:37.833
WE'RE LISTENING.

22:37.867 --> 22:39.500
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH EMILY'S HEART?

22:39.533 --> 22:41.800
THE CHAMBERS ON THE LEFT SIDE
ARE UNDERDEVELOPED.

22:41.833 --> 22:43.733
IN ADDITION,
THE MITRAL VALVE,

22:43.767 --> 22:46.300
WHICH CONNECTS
THESE TWO CHAMBERS,

22:46.333 --> 22:47.667
IS ABNORMALLY NARROW.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.567
(elevator dings)

22:50.600 --> 22:52.533
(clears throat)

23:01.133 --> 23:02.600
IT'S A KEY.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.533
JUST A KEY?

23:04.567 --> 23:06.133
JUST A KEY.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.367
WELL, GOOD.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.700
GOOD. GOOD.

23:15.633 --> 23:17.500
OR...

23:17.533 --> 23:20.467
YOU COULD START THINKING
ABOUT MOVING IN WITH ME.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.067
(elevator dings)

23:44.100 --> 23:45.633
DON'T MIND ME.

23:46.733 --> 23:48.633
WHAT'S UP WITH DOYLE?

23:48.667 --> 23:50.667
I HAD TO FIRE HIM.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.633
GET ME SOME WATER.
I'M DRYING UP.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.267
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S THE TUMOR TALKING.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.367
YOUR I.V.'s
KEEPING YOU HYDRATED.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.267
SO WHY'D YOU FIRE DOYLE?
HE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD GUY.

24:00.300 --> 24:04.267
I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES.
HE DIDN'T RESPECT ME ANYMORE.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.300
HE THOUGHT
HE WAS YOUR FRIEND.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.133
FRIEND? DOYLE?

24:08.167 --> 24:10.633
OH, RIGHT, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

24:10.667 --> 24:13.133
IF I DID, I WOULDN'T
LET THEM SEE ME LIKE THIS.

24:13.167 --> 24:15.067
ILLNESS IS A SIGN
OF WEAKNESS.

24:15.067 --> 24:17.333
ONCE THEY SEE IT, THEY NEVER
LOOK AT YOU THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

24:17.367 --> 24:19.567
I MEAN,
YOU'RE A HOTSHOT DOCTOR.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.600
I'M SURE YOU DON'T LET
ALL THE OTHER HOTSHOT DOCTORS

24:21.633 --> 24:23.533
AROUND HERE KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

24:23.567 --> 24:26.400
NO, I'M A HOTSHOT DOCTOR.
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

24:26.433 --> 24:29.067
YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS EITHER.

24:33.567 --> 24:37.400
OH, MY LORD.
OOH, CHILD.

24:37.433 --> 24:38.533
DON'T TELL ME.

24:38.567 --> 24:39.767
THE FLAG IS FLYING
ONCE AGAIN.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.300
HEY, NOTHING I DID.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.300
WELL, WE TRIED EVERYTHING.
SO IT MUST BE NEURAL.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.267
NEURAL?

24:44.300 --> 24:46.400
SHE ALREADY CALLED
FOR A CONSULT.

24:49.333 --> 24:52.067
A CONSULT?
YOU CALLED NEURAL FOR A CONSULT?

24:52.100 --> 24:54.700
HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU BROKE THE BOY'S PENIS.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.567
WELL, HELLO,
EVERYBODY.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.600
WHAT'S UP?

25:09.067 --> 25:09.900
HMM.

25:09.933 --> 25:12.800
SO WHEN DID THIS, UM,
PROBLEM BEGIN?

25:12.833 --> 25:14.733
WELL, I HAD AN ERECTION
LAST NIGHT

25:14.767 --> 25:16.233
AND WOKE UP
WITH ONE THIS MORNING.

25:16.267 --> 25:18.167
UH, DR. SHEPHERD,
IF YOU DON'T NEED ME,

25:18.200 --> 25:20.367
THE OTHER DR. SHEPHERD NEEDS
A CONSULT ON ONE OF THE QUINTS.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.633
YEAH, NO, WE'RE FINE.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.467
SO WHEN DID YOU
LAST EJACULATE?

25:24.500 --> 25:26.467
I'M NOT SURE.
MEREDITH?

25:29.067 --> 25:32.400
OH, I'M...
I'M GONNA GO WITH DR. BAILEY.

25:32.433 --> 25:36.067
MEREDITH, WHAT TIME
DID WE, UH...

25:36.100 --> 25:37.600
YOU KNOW.

25:38.833 --> 25:42.367
YES, MEREDITH,
WHAT TIME DID YOU TWO...

25:45.667 --> 25:47.567
(monitor beeps)

25:53.333 --> 25:55.167
HERE IT IS.
RIGHT THERE--THE OMPHALOCELE.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.567
YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.500
THAT'S THE SCARIEST WORD YET.

25:59.533 --> 26:01.433
OH, ALL IT MEANS IS SOME OF
THE BABY'S INTERNAL ORGANS

26:01.467 --> 26:03.467
ARE GROWING IN A SAC
OUTSIDE ITS BODY.
CRISTINA!

26:03.500 --> 26:05.433
"ALL IT MEANS"?

26:05.467 --> 26:07.367
HER ORGANS ARE GROWING
OUTSIDE OF HER BODY.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.133
THAT'S ALL IT MEANS?

26:10.167 --> 26:12.467
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.600
I'LL REMOVE THE SAC MEMBRANE
CONTAINING THE ORGANS.

26:14.633 --> 26:16.833
MAKE A SMALL INCISION
IN THE BABY'S ABDOMEN

26:16.867 --> 26:20.267
AND PUT THEM BACK INSIDE.

26:20.300 --> 26:24.667
OH, JULIE.

26:24.700 --> 26:27.567
SHE'S THE QUIET ONE.

26:38.567 --> 26:40.667
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK--

26:40.700 --> 26:42.633
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER?

26:42.667 --> 26:45.333
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

26:48.167 --> 26:53.300
I KNOW THAT YOU PREFER
AN 11 BLADE FOR YOUR I AND D's.

26:53.333 --> 26:55.400
I KNOW YOU PREFER TO SAY
"PICK UPS" INSTEAD OF "FORCEPS."

26:55.433 --> 26:57.333
I KNOW YOU LIKE
YOUR COFFEE

26:57.367 --> 26:59.833
FROM THE CART
BY THE FRONT ENTRANCE

26:59.867 --> 27:02.367
BETTER THAN THE COFFEE
IN THE CAFETERIA. I KNOW YOU.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.667
THOSE ARE LITTLE THINGS--
JUST DETAILS.

27:09.100 --> 27:10.467
I KNOW YOU.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.433
YOU DON'T WANNA MOVE.

27:13.467 --> 27:17.567
BUT I CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE ONE
THAT TAKES THE STEP.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.133
ANY MORE STEPS,
AND I'M WALKING AWAY.

27:32.733 --> 27:34.633
MR. MARTIN!

27:34.667 --> 27:36.333
MR. MARTIN, PLEASE!

27:36.367 --> 27:39.267
MR. MARTIN, PLEASE, YOU HEARD
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID!

27:39.300 --> 27:41.200
I DON'T NEED ANY DOCTORS.
I DON'T NEED ANYONE!

27:41.233 --> 27:43.133
OPEN THE DOOR, MARTIN.

27:43.167 --> 27:45.067
(water running)
I AM AN ISLAND.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.400
A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND
SURROUNDED BY WATER.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.300
WHAT DO YOU
WANNA DO?
SHEPHERD GAVE ME
ONE JOB TO DO--

27:50.333 --> 27:53.200
JUST KEEP THIS DUDE
FROM DRINKING WATER.
DO YOU WANT ME
TO PAGE HIM?

27:53.233 --> 27:55.133
NO, I CAN HANDLE THIS.
JUST GO GET SOME RESTRAINTS

27:55.167 --> 27:57.167
AND TURN THE WATER OFF
TO THE FLOOR.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.433
MARTIN, OPEN THE DOOR!

27:58.467 --> 28:01.367
YOUR C.T. SHOWS A TUMOR
ON YOUR LOWER SPINE

28:01.400 --> 28:02.800
WHICH IS PRESSING AGAINST
YOUR CAVERNOUS NERVE.

28:02.833 --> 28:05.333
WHICH IS CAUSING
THE ERECTION.

28:05.367 --> 28:08.233
A TUMOR? RIGHT.

28:08.267 --> 28:11.200
A-A TUMOR. SO...

28:11.233 --> 28:13.133
I SHOULD BE SCARED, RIGHT?

28:13.167 --> 28:16.067
THIS IS--
THIS IS THE TIME FOR SCARED.

28:16.100 --> 28:21.433
UM, IT'S GOING
TO BE FINE.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.333
UM, DR. SHEPHERD IS GONNA
SCHEDULE A SURGERY.

28:23.367 --> 28:25.267
YES, I'LL REMOVE THE TUMOR

28:25.300 --> 28:28.200
AND EVERYTHING SHOULD
RETURN TO NORMAL.
"NORMAL" NORMAL?

28:28.233 --> 28:31.200
I HAVE A UROLOGIST ON HIS WAY
UP TO TALK TO YOU, BUT YES--

28:31.233 --> 28:33.133
"NORMAL" NORMAL.

28:33.167 --> 28:36.067
CAN YOU CALL MY MOM?

28:36.100 --> 28:37.833
HER NUMBER'S
IN MY WALLET.

28:37.867 --> 28:40.133
TELL HER TO COME, BUT DON'T
TELL HER ABOUT THE TUMOR.

28:40.167 --> 28:41.700
I DON'T WANNA FREAK HER OUT
WHEN SHE HAS TO GET ON A PLANE.

28:41.733 --> 28:43.333
SURE. OKAY.

28:43.367 --> 28:47.267
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER?
WE'RE NOT...
SEEING EACH OTHER.

28:47.300 --> 28:49.600
WE MET LAST NIGHT
AT JOE'S.

28:49.633 --> 28:51.267
JOE'S BAR?

28:51.300 --> 28:54.433
HMM. I MET A GIRL
THERE ONCE MYSELF.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.700
A VERY LONG TIME AGO.

29:02.267 --> 29:03.600
THE WATER'S OFF!

29:03.633 --> 29:05.533
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL HE SOBERS UP.

29:05.567 --> 29:07.500
NO, HIS SODIUM LEVELS
WILL DROP TOO LOW.

29:24.067 --> 29:25.467
NO!

29:25.500 --> 29:28.067
NO! LEAVE ME ALONE!

29:28.067 --> 29:29.367
LET ME GO BACK!

29:29.400 --> 29:31.533
I NEED THE WATER.
I NEED IT!

29:31.567 --> 29:33.467
MARTIN, WE'RE TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.633
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP!

29:35.667 --> 29:38.600
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO LOOK AT ME. I'M PATHETIC!

29:38.633 --> 29:40.433
STOP LOOKING AT ME!

29:40.467 --> 29:43.467
STOP LOOKING AT ME!

29:43.500 --> 29:46.300
GIVE HIM
A 3% HYPERTONIC SOLUTION.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.333
500 cc's PER HOUR THE NEXT
4 HOURS TO STABILIZE HIM.

29:50.533 --> 29:52.833
YOU THINK YOU'RE SUCH
A HOTSHOT DOCTOR.

29:52.867 --> 29:54.767
YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE NOTHING!

29:54.800 --> 29:57.133
I'M GONNA
FIRE YOU, TOO.

29:57.167 --> 29:59.733
GO AHEAD. FIRE ME.

30:10.467 --> 30:12.400
(door closes)

30:13.767 --> 30:15.133
I USED THE KEY.

30:17.167 --> 30:20.000
THAT'S A STEP.

30:26.333 --> 30:28.400
SO YOU REALLY
WANNA KNOW ME?

30:28.433 --> 30:31.267
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN REVEAL ABOUT YOURSELF

30:31.300 --> 30:33.233
THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW.

30:51.500 --> 30:56.100
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.

30:56.133 --> 30:58.233
MY MOTHER DECORATED IT.

31:02.067 --> 31:04.800
I DON'T DO LAUNDRY.
I BUY NEW UNDERWEAR.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.700
SEE, AND, UH,
UNDER THE TABLE--

31:06.733 --> 31:08.833
SIX MONTHS OF MAGAZINES
I KNOW I'LL NEVER READ.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.800
BUT I WON'T THROW OUT.

31:10.833 --> 31:12.467
I DON'T WASH DISHES, VACUUM,

31:12.500 --> 31:14.467
OR PUT THE TOILET PAPER
ON THE HOLDER.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.367
I HIRED A MAID ONCE.
SHE RAN AWAY CRYING.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.833
UH, THE ONLY THINGS
IN MY FRIDGE

31:19.867 --> 31:22.167
ARE WATER, VODKA
AND DIET SODA.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.067
AND I DON'T CARE.

31:24.100 --> 31:25.800
BUT YOU DO.

31:29.767 --> 31:33.667
STILL THINK LIVING TOGETHER
IS A GOOD IDEA?

31:46.867 --> 31:48.767
HEY, ADDISON WANTS ME
TO PUT YOU GUYS ON NOTICE.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.700
WHEN THE QUINTS ARE BORN,

31:50.733 --> 31:52.633
WE'RE GONNA NEED
EVERYONE AVAILABLE.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.567
THERE'S GONNA BE FIVE BABIES,
AT LEAST THREE SURGERIES.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.467
WE'RE GONNA NEED
ALL THE HANDS WE CAN GET.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.167
OKAY.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.233
FINE.

32:00.267 --> 32:02.800
SO I'LL JUST PAGE YOU GUYS
WHEN WE NEED YOU?

32:02.833 --> 32:04.467
OKAY.
FINE.

32:07.267 --> 32:09.233
OKAY, THEN.

32:09.267 --> 32:11.267
I WAS STUDYING.
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

32:11.300 --> 32:14.067
I WAS STARING AT THE CEILING
IN ABJECT HORROR.

32:14.067 --> 32:16.267
MY ONE NIGHT STAND
IS A NEUROSURGICAL CASE.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.533
I HEARD YOU BROKE
HIS PENIS. NICE.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.600
SO I'M HAVING A LOT OF SEX.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

32:20.633 --> 32:22.567
NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT AT ALL.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.567
IT ONLY GETS PROBLEMATIC
WHEN YOU START TO CARE.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.767
WHEN YOU LET YOUR EMOTIONS
GET IN THE WAY, YOU KNOW?

32:27.800 --> 32:31.300
YEAH, RIGHT.

32:34.167 --> 32:35.333
(pager beeps)

32:38.300 --> 32:40.233
DAMN IT.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.833
I'LL JUST TAKE THE TEA.

32:45.867 --> 32:48.233
WHAT IS IT?
WHY'D YOU PAGE ME?

32:48.267 --> 32:51.067
HE WAS ACTING ALL JITTERY
AND STARTED SLURRING HIS WORDS.

32:51.067 --> 32:52.467
MARTIN,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

32:52.500 --> 32:53.700
(monitor beeping rapidly)

32:53.733 --> 32:55.600
2 OF ATIVAN.
HE STARTED SEIZING.

32:55.633 --> 32:58.300
HOW MUCH SODIUM
DID YOU GIVE HIM?
500 cc OVER 4 HOURS.

32:58.333 --> 33:01.333
ACTUALLY, DOCTOR, YOU ORDERED
500 cc PER HOUR OVER 4 HOURS.

33:01.367 --> 33:03.400
TOO FAST.
HIS BRAIN IS SWELLING.

33:03.433 --> 33:05.833
I THOUGHT I SAID--
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO
A FOLLOW-UP?

33:05.867 --> 33:08.067
I GAVE YOU
ONE THING TO DO!
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY,
RIGHT?

33:08.100 --> 33:10.633
IF HE'S PERMANENTLY IMPAIRED,

33:10.667 --> 33:13.533
I CAN'T OPERATE ON HIM
LIKE THIS.

33:30.767 --> 33:32.533
I'M SORRY.

33:32.567 --> 33:34.300
I WASN'T TRYING
TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE,

33:34.333 --> 33:36.733
BUT DR. SHEPHERD
NEEDED TO KNOW.

33:36.767 --> 33:38.500
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT A GOOD DOCTOR.

33:38.533 --> 33:39.767
YEAH, WELL,
LATELY, I'M CRAP.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.533
YEAH, WELL,

33:42.567 --> 33:45.433
THINGS HAVE BEEN KIND OF CRAPPY
FOR ME, TOO, LATELY.

33:45.467 --> 33:48.233
ALSO MY FAULT.

33:48.267 --> 33:52.167
WE BOTH
MADE MISTAKES.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.800
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING--

33:54.833 --> 33:56.733
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER,

33:56.767 --> 33:59.800
IT WAS GOOD, RIGHT?

33:59.833 --> 34:01.633
YOU MEAN...

34:08.367 --> 34:13.067
YEAH, YEAH.
IT WAS GOOD.

34:13.067 --> 34:16.133
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

34:16.167 --> 34:19.067
IT WAS PRETTY... GREAT.

34:19.100 --> 34:22.567
IT WAS, WASN'T IT?
IT WAS LIKE, EASY, SIMPLE.

34:35.100 --> 34:39.067
YOU BETTER HAVE
A CONDOM THIS TIME.

34:40.333 --> 34:46.367
OH, THERE IT IS.
IT'S ON THE S1 VERTEBRA.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.767
SO REMOVING IT
SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM?

34:48.800 --> 34:51.300
MMM. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THERE'S ANY NERVE DAMAGE.

34:51.333 --> 34:53.400
SHOULDN'T BE
ANY LONG-TERM EFFECT.

34:53.433 --> 34:55.533
I'D WAIT A FEW WEEKS
BEFORE I TESTED IT OUT, THOUGH.

34:55.567 --> 34:59.167
FUNNY.
YOU'RE A FUNNY MAN.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.633
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TWO WERE DATING.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.700
WELL, YOU KNEW IT WOULD
HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

35:04.733 --> 35:07.567
EVENTUALLY FEELS A LOT
DIFFERENT THAN ACTUALLY.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.700
YEAH, I GUESS IT DOES.

35:10.733 --> 35:14.767
IT'S SURPRISINGLY
PAINFUL.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.067
IT GETS BETTER.

35:21.067 --> 35:23.067
DOES IT?

35:23.067 --> 35:24.100
I DON'T KNOW.

35:24.133 --> 35:26.067
BUT I'M DETERMINED
TO BE OPTIMISTIC.

35:38.567 --> 35:42.067
SO YOU'VE OFFICIALLY SIGNED
YOUR CONTRACT. CONGRATULATIONS.

35:42.067 --> 35:43.800
TIME TO MOVE FORWARD.

35:43.833 --> 35:45.200
YEAH, IT IS.

35:49.367 --> 35:51.600
WE'RE OKAY, RIGHT?

35:51.633 --> 35:53.667
YEAH, WE'RE OKAY.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.700
(pager beeps)

35:55.733 --> 35:58.600
IT'S DORIE.

36:03.167 --> 36:05.067
OH! OW!

36:05.067 --> 36:06.800
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:06.833 --> 36:08.200
THERE'S FETAL DISTRESS.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.133
MY CONTRACTIONS
ARE REALLY HURTING!

36:10.167 --> 36:12.567
AND I THINK
MY WATER BROKE!

36:14.767 --> 36:16.667
HER PLACENTA'S TEARING.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.600
OKAY, DORIE,
WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

36:18.633 --> 36:20.733
THE BABIES HAVE TO
COME OUT NOW.

36:20.767 --> 36:23.467
IT'S OKAY. WE'RE GONNA TAKE
REALLY GOOD CARE OF YOU.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.367
JUST KEEP BREATHING.

36:29.667 --> 36:33.100
UH, DORIE, THE O.R.'s PREPPED
AND READY TO GO. WHERE'S TOM?

36:33.133 --> 36:35.067
HE'S AT HOME
WITH THE BOYS.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.433
NO, I CALLED TOM.
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

36:36.467 --> 36:38.100
IZZIE, GO AHEAD AND PAGE
EVERYONE ON DORIE'S TEAM.

36:38.133 --> 36:40.700
THE LIST IS POSTED
AT THE NURSE'S STATION.

36:40.733 --> 36:43.533
NO! NO!

36:43.567 --> 36:44.733
DORIE, DORIE,
YOU'RE FINE.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.133
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

36:46.167 --> 36:48.067
NOTHING ABOUT THIS
IS FINE!

36:48.100 --> 36:50.333
IT'S TOO EARLY!
THEY'RE TOO HURT!

36:50.367 --> 36:51.500
DORIE...

36:51.533 --> 36:53.433
YOU'VE CARRIED
YOUR GIRLS THIS FAR.

36:53.467 --> 36:55.133
NOW IT'S OUR TURN.

36:55.167 --> 36:57.267
YOU HAVE TO TRUST US
TO BRING THEM INTO THE WORLD.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.233
TOM'S ON HIS WAY?
TOM'S ON HIS WAY.

37:04.633 --> 37:06.333
HEY.
HEY.

37:06.367 --> 37:09.133
GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU
I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

37:09.167 --> 37:12.400
SO DR. SHEPHERD
REMOVED THE TUMOR

37:12.433 --> 37:14.433
WITHOUT ANY COMPLICATIONS.

37:14.467 --> 37:16.333
I JUST WANNA
THANK YOU

37:16.367 --> 37:19.500
FOR BEING THERE
FOR ME.

37:19.533 --> 37:22.100
I MEAN, NORMALLY,

37:22.133 --> 37:24.067
YOU DON'T EXPECT
YOUR ONE NIGHT STAND

37:24.067 --> 37:26.100
TO STICK BY YOU
THROUGH A TUMOR.

37:26.133 --> 37:28.600
MAYBE WHEN I GET OUT
OF HERE WE COULD--

37:28.633 --> 37:30.067
I DON'T THINK SO.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.833
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

37:31.867 --> 37:35.400
YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAW YOU
AT JOE'S, I WAS JUST...

37:35.433 --> 37:37.333
LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT.

37:37.367 --> 37:39.533
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.300
YOU DESERVE
BETTER THAN THAT.

37:43.333 --> 37:46.533
(pager beeping)

37:46.567 --> 37:48.767
(beeping stops)

37:53.267 --> 37:57.533
(pager beeps)

37:57.567 --> 37:59.567
SORRY, I GOTTA GO.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.133
(pager beeps)

38:03.167 --> 38:06.067
(pagers beeping)

38:07.167 --> 38:08.500
THE QUINTS.

38:08.533 --> 38:10.667
EVERYONE ANSWERED THEIR PAGE
EXCEPT DR. KAREV.

38:10.700 --> 38:11.900
WHERE IS HE?
WE NEED EVERYONE!

38:11.933 --> 38:14.233
I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS ON CALL
LAST NIGHT. HE MIGHT BE ASLEEP.

38:14.267 --> 38:16.100
GO FIND HIM!

38:16.133 --> 38:19.500
(pager beeping)

38:24.233 --> 38:26.533
IT'S TIME FOR THE QUINTS.
WE NEED YOU.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.200
(baby crying)

39:06.233 --> 39:08.367
HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
IS TOO MUCH?

39:08.400 --> 39:12.433
TOO MUCH TOO SOON?

39:24.067 --> 39:27.667
(baby crying)

39:30.533 --> 39:34.233
TOO MUCH INFORMATION?

39:47.267 --> 39:50.167
(baby crying)

39:52.400 --> 39:55.267
TOO MUCH FUN?

39:55.300 --> 39:58.200
(baby crying)

40:00.867 --> 40:02.800
TOO MUCH LOVE?

40:05.100 --> 40:06.800
TOO MUCH TO ASK?

40:11.233 --> 40:13.733
(baby crying)

40:22.400 --> 40:26.333
AND WHEN IS IT ALL
JUST TOO MUCH TO BEAR?

40:41.233 --> 40:44.133
(monitor beeping)
