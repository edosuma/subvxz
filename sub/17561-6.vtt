00:04.045 --> 00:05.296
What better way to show Vic

00:05.380 --> 00:06.715
that you don't wanna
be married to him

00:06.798 --> 00:08.633
than to fall in love
with another man.

to fall in love with you, hm?

00:14.347 --> 00:15.473
Hey, buy her
a bottle of tequila

00:15.557 --> 00:16.850
she might marry you!

You guys want to spend

00:39.789 --> 00:42.584
I understand why that ankle
bracelet means so much to you.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.003
I mean, Henry
was your first love.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.297
I never had a first love

Charlie,
this is a diamond bracelet.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.351
I had a really excellent
time tonight.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.147
Nana? It's Charlie.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.149
Of course she took the bracelet.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.151

- Alright.
- Ugh.

What are you doing here?

01:40.850 --> 01:42.352
You're supposed to be
at the firehouse.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.394
Holly is in Vermont.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.146
I was supposed
to be alone tonight.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.483
Peaceful and happy, the way
I was before the incident.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.526
Oh, you mean the, uh

01:49.609 --> 01:51.027

02:13.466 --> 02:14.592
They're tired. They're napping.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.802
She said she loves us.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.554
And she said since we're alone

we should go for it.

Tina, it's our first time.
I want it to be special.

it'll be more special
