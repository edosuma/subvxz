10:32.632 --> 10:34.024
devious little snipe
in a fat suit.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.286
Did you really think
you could rat me out

10:35.373 --> 10:36.810
to Yale and get away with it?

10:36.897 --> 10:38.463
I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.857
Everyone's jealous of me
because, my life is perfect

10:40.944 --> 10:42.946
and you've always been
the most jealous of all.

10:43.033 --> 10:47.124
People aren't jealous of you,
Blair. They hateyou.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.909
I didn't call Yale, and
good luck figuring out who did.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.258
There are about
a thousand people

10:50.345 --> 10:51.302
who would relish
taking you down.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.782
[multiple phone alerts]

10:55.002 --> 10:57.613
Wanna hear
the sickest scandal ever?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.267
Remember B's Lord?

10:59.354 --> 11:01.269
Turns out he was giving
the royal treatment

11:01.356 --> 11:04.838
to his own queen mother.
And the worst part?

11:04.925 --> 11:07.318
B knew and ignored it.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.712
How desperate can you be, B?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.715
No wonder, Yale, dumped you.
Who wants inbred legacies?

11:12.802 --> 11:14.978
Someone's out to get you, Blair.
It's just not me.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.287
Vanessa.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.984
Julian. Hey,
I made the adjustment

11:21.071 --> 11:22.464
you suggested
in the garden scene.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.945
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Um, good show, Sabrina.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.515
[smirks]
So, how does it feel
to play May Welland

11:30.602 --> 11:34.041
Well, it feels like my
character's rubbing off on me.

11:34.128 --> 11:38.001
May's fiance pays no attention
to her and as for me..

11:40.003 --> 11:42.049
Are you talking
about Julian?

11:42.136 --> 11:44.355
Oh, well,
the play opens tomorrow.

11:44.442 --> 11:45.705
He's just distracted.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.100
Julian, hey,
I was just thinking

11:50.187 --> 11:53.756
it would be really helpful for
my friend Vanessa's, documentary

11:53.843 --> 11:55.410
to hear more about
your vision for the show.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.238
Why don't
we all grab a bite to eat?

11:57.325 --> 11:59.719
I suppose it couldn't hurt to,
uh, give my actors

11:59.806 --> 12:01.982
a little more insight
into my intentions.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.811
Let me just grab my stuff.
I'll meet you in front.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.508
Airing my dirty laundry to Yale

12:06.595 --> 12:08.902
and sending the Lord Marcus,
Gossip Girl blast

12:08.989 --> 12:11.252
makes you officially
my enemy number one.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.124
I don't know what
you're talking about, Blair.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.909
- Honestly.
- What are you doing with her?

12:15.996 --> 12:17.693
- We hate her.
- I don't hate her.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.739
She's my friend, actually.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.262
And you just
need to calm down--

12:21.349 --> 12:24.482
Calm down, Serena?
She got me axed from Yale.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.571
Okay.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.922
You're seriously
taking her side? Fine.

12:29.009 --> 12:32.099
But a word of advice,
she will be destroyed

12:32.186 --> 12:34.405
and you don't want to become
collateral damage.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.407
[scoffs]

12:43.284 --> 12:44.589
Thank you.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.330
I've been bathing
like the French

12:46.417 --> 12:47.854
in restaurant bathrooms
all week.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.377
So, you've been
on the run.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.684
You know,
I wanted to contact you.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.905
I felt like we had a connection.
But I was scared.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.602
- And Carter?
- I just met him.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.779
He told me he was rich,
so I thought he could help.

12:59.866 --> 13:00.910
Please.

13:02.564 --> 13:05.132
Look, no one
is going to hurt you.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.786
Are you kidding?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.309
You know the kind of people
who are members?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.006
They're powerful men,
and the things

13:10.093 --> 13:11.921
I know about them
could destroy their lives.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.576
Nobody ever told me that once
you're in, you're in for good.

13:14.663 --> 13:17.579
If only I could
just...leave the country

13:17.666 --> 13:19.276
start over
with a clean slate.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.931
So, that's what you'll do.
Money's not a problem.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.412
We'll get you a new identity,
a new passport.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.587
How?

13:26.980 --> 13:28.155
I know a guy.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.592
Thank you.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.510
[instrumental music]

13:37.686 --> 13:39.731
Hey, just one question.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.431
How do you feel
about Brazil?

13:50.090 --> 13:53.745
Scorsese, said that
he considers, "Age Of Innocence"

13:53.833 --> 13:57.271
more violent than his films
with guns and blood.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.316
Marty's inspiration
was "The Heiress."

13:59.403 --> 14:00.927
- William Wyler.
- So, you're a Wyler fan?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.363
Have you
ever seen "Little Foxes"?

14:02.450 --> 14:03.886
Are you kidding?

14:06.280 --> 14:09.196
Serena, made me see it,
like, what, three times?

14:09.283 --> 14:12.416
She's obsessed
with Bette Davis.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.679
Yeah, Bette Davis.
I, um..

14:16.333 --> 14:19.119
I love her eyes.
Her hair is Harlow gold.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.381
Hey, listen.
I'm gonna take off, okay?

14:20.468 --> 14:22.165
I'll come with.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.037
Oh, I was just gonna tell you
my take on the play.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.474
Yes, that's a great idea.
Don't go, please.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.478
- Nate, do you mind?
- No, no. It's, uh, it's cool.

14:30.565 --> 14:34.612
Listen I have...lines to
practice anyway, so I'll go now.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.050
[piano music]

14:40.967 --> 14:42.794
- So..
- You know, uh..

14:42.882 --> 14:43.970
...Nate's got
the right idea.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.319
I didn't realize
how late it was.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.886
Let me just
grab the check.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.500
Thank God. Serena,
I know you like him

14:52.587 --> 14:56.547
but as your friend, Julian
is the most self-absorbed

14:56.634 --> 14:58.158
pompous person,
I've ever met.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.811
All he does is go on and on
about classic movies

14:59.899 --> 15:01.204
and it's totally annoying.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.597
You were keeping up with him
pretty good there.

15:02.684 --> 15:06.253
Yeah, and I'm
totally annoying.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.558
[laughs]

15:07.645 --> 15:08.951
Thanks, ladies.
Don't worry.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.213
- It's taken care off.
- Oh.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.867
And, uh,
it's been a lot of fun.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.043
It has.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.480
Uh, you know, all this talk
about Bette Davis

15:16.567 --> 15:18.656
'has-has really got me thinking
about my character.'

15:18.743 --> 15:20.354
You know,
I think I could use

15:20.441 --> 15:21.833
some more coaching before
the show. What do you say?

15:21.921 --> 15:25.489
Sure. Say, 4 O'clock?
Text me your address.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.708
Great.

15:30.233 --> 15:33.584
- So, what are you up to?
- You mean, what are weup to?

15:33.671 --> 15:38.024
I may not be a huge classic film
buff, but I have read "Cyrano."

15:38.111 --> 15:41.375
[sighs]
Hey. Sorry, when I
finally came out, you were gone.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.811
- So--
- You were great in the play.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.552
- I just--
- No, I-I-I meant with Rachel.

15:44.639 --> 15:48.643
- Do you, like-did she respond?
- Uh, yeah. She wrote a note.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.385
Alright, w-well, great.
Where is it?

15:53.169 --> 15:54.954
Um, dad has it.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.395
[door opens]

16:05.747 --> 16:08.445
- Mr. Humphrey--
- I believe this belongs to you.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.927
[intense music]

16:15.104 --> 16:19.065
[Gossip Girl]
Poor Miss Iowa
caught playing Mrs. Robinson.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.284
Looks like the teacher
just got schooled.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.206
- Dan, we need to talk.
- Well, I've got nothing to say.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.729
I went to see Miss Carr,
last night.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.731
This thing between
the two of you it's over.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.081
Well, we'll see.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.778
You cannot be
this short-sighted.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.127
If word gets out about this,
you'll be expelled.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.694
Miss Carr, will be fired
for good.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.130
Well, Miss Carr is the one
who sent me the key.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.523
So presumably,
she understands that risk

16:42.610 --> 16:43.959
and she's making
her own decision.

16:44.046 --> 16:44.960
However, grown-up you
think you are

16:45.047 --> 16:46.744
you're still in high school.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.790
[Dan]
'I care about Rachel, alright?
And I'm 18.'

16:48.877 --> 16:51.010
So, with all due respect,
I think I'll decide who I see.

16:57.538 --> 16:58.887
Oh, do go on, Newland.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.063
I do love your descriptions.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.457
Well, why shouldn't
we make them real?

17:03.544 --> 17:06.677
We shall my dearest,
of course, next year.

17:09.202 --> 17:12.901
See, May...is all about
what's proper.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.685
You've read
other Wharton novels, right?

17:14.772 --> 17:16.426
"The House Of Mirth"?

17:16.513 --> 17:19.081
Yes. Yes, I-I have.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.953
Good, because "House Of Mirth",
was a huge influence on Clayton.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.260
Jack Clayton.
He directed "The Great Gatsby."

17:24.347 --> 17:26.088
Jack Clayton, "Gatsby."

17:26.175 --> 17:28.134
Most critics consider
it a failed adaptation.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.441
No offense, Mr. Film Fanatic,
but I-I don't think the movie

17:31.528 --> 17:33.313
was nearly as good
as the book.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.402
I don't disagree.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.056
Why do yousay so?

17:37.143 --> 17:38.492
Some blame
Clayton's direction

17:38.579 --> 17:40.537
others point the finger
at Coppola's screenplay.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.670
In "the times",
Vincent Canby, said--

17:42.757 --> 17:44.541
- Whoa. Slow down.
- Excuse me?

17:44.628 --> 17:48.197
No, excuse me. It's just
that sometimes my thoughts

17:48.284 --> 17:51.200
come so fast that I, uh,
I get confused.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.680
Sorry, from now on,
I'll say a line

17:52.767 --> 17:54.029
and all you have to do
is repeat it exactly.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.030
[Julian]
'You're quite right.'

17:55.117 --> 17:58.120
The film is...impotent.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.383
It totally misses
with the book is even about

18:00.470 --> 18:04.170
[Julian]
'the eternal conflict between
the repression of society'

18:04.257 --> 18:06.302
and the passion
of the individual.

18:06.389 --> 18:09.305
You are so,
insightful, Julian.

18:09.392 --> 18:12.221
I completely agree about the
power of unexpressed passion.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.832
You know, you are so,
insightful, Julian.

18:14.919 --> 18:20.099
I-I completely agree about the
power of...unexpressed passion.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.190
[chuckles]

18:25.974 --> 18:28.846
I have to confess,
I underestimated you.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.152
You're quite extraordinary.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.501
[chuckles]

18:32.807 --> 18:34.200
Shall we get back
to the scene?

18:38.856 --> 18:40.380
[cellphone beeping]
What was that?

18:40.467 --> 18:43.513
[scoffs]
I'm sorry. Just one second.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.862
It's a text.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.998
Yale's hallowed halls
have gone to hell.

18:50.085 --> 18:53.915
S got accepted
but not for her SAT scores.

18:54.002 --> 18:57.092
Allowing apress release
was her only prerequisite.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.617
I've to go.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.926
I-I lost track
of time again.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.406
We're late for the theater.
Are you ready to go?

19:06.493 --> 19:08.016
Yeah. Yeah.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.062
Good to see you, Hayley.

19:13.064 --> 19:16.546
- Or should I call you Elle?
- Sorry, I ran off like that.

19:16.633 --> 19:17.939
I just didn't know
if I could trust you or not.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.984
Baizen, you know,
I'm not your biggest fan

19:20.071 --> 19:21.769
but you are an expert
at crossing borders.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.901
I'm happy to oblige.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.469
Especially, if it means having,
Chuck Bass, owe me a favor.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.690
But my passport guy,
he's a bit of a paranoid freak.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.561
- He won't like an entourage.
- I understand.

19:31.648 --> 19:35.086
Look, you take Elle,
and I'll meet you at Teterboro.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.220
It's okay.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.004
Thank you.
I'm so grateful.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.661
[instrumental music]

19:48.274 --> 19:49.666
[Carter]
'Don't worry, Bass.'

19:49.753 --> 19:51.146
We'll take care of her.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.626
[laughs]

19:56.978 --> 19:58.153
[Blair]
I've lost everything.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.764
I'm humiliated and shunned.

20:02.897 --> 20:05.987
They've made me a flesh
and blood Countess Olenska.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.771
You are an actress.

20:07.858 --> 20:11.210
Pour it into the role.
Use pain onstage.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.604
You're right.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.694
I'm an actress.

20:17.781 --> 20:18.956
No..

20:20.436 --> 20:21.872
I'm a seagull.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.310
No, you're a shameless bitch.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.833
Now what?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.531
Everything you've done
spreading rumors about

20:28.618 --> 20:31.491
who I've had sex with,
what alley I puked in

20:31.578 --> 20:35.146
or telling Dean Berube
that I killed Pete Fairman.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.148
I forgave everything
all because I thought

20:37.236 --> 20:38.976
one day you'd grow up,
but putting out

20:39.063 --> 20:41.544
a "Gossip Girl" blast about
Yale and the press release.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.242
Serena, I didn't
put out the blast.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.722
At least have the dignity
not to lie to my face.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.376
Wait. But I'm not lying.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.509
Only two people knew about it
you and Dan

20:49.596 --> 20:51.250
and Dan would never
do something like that.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.382
I always want to believe
the best in you, Blair.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.776
The bottom line is,
betrayal's in your nature.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.389
[intense music]

21:04.872 --> 21:06.090
I didn't do it, Dorota.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.355
I believe you,
Miss Blair.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.748
And if I didn't,
that means Dan Humphrey did.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.272
Vanessa told him
about Marcus

21:13.359 --> 21:14.534
and he could've
put that out too

21:14.621 --> 21:16.100
all to get back at me
for teacher gate.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.102
Do you know how hard it is
to get revenge

21:18.189 --> 21:20.017
when your enemy is changing
every five minutes?

21:20.104 --> 21:24.283
You need to calm nerves and warm
vocal chord. You want tea?

21:24.370 --> 21:26.633
No, I want Dan Humphrey's head
on a platter.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.246
Rachel, hey, hey. I've been
looking for you everywhere.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.769
- We have to talk.
- No, Dan.

21:32.856 --> 21:33.988
We need to stay away
from each other.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.294
My dad showed up
at your house.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.469
We need to at least
discuss this.

21:36.556 --> 21:37.818
People are coming.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.298
[lock clicks]

21:46.130 --> 21:48.176

to respond to your note.

21:48.263 --> 21:49.873
Rachel..

21:49.960 --> 21:51.353
What are we doing?

21:52.876 --> 21:54.182
I-I can't help myself.

21:57.228 --> 22:00.188
Am I supposed to pretend I'm not
feeling what I'm feeling?

22:00.275 --> 22:02.059
You know this can't last.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.584

- Hey.
- Hey.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.813
So what happened
with Julian?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.510
We were in the middle of it,
and then you just hung up.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.033
Oh, sorry.
I had to get off the phone.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.557
But I shall
never let her see

23:04.644 --> 23:06.385

23:28.624 --> 23:30.321
At last,
I was beginning to think

23:30.409 --> 23:31.845
you were
so besotted with love

23:31.932 --> 23:33.803
you'd forgotten about
your old grandmother.

Mr. Campbell.'

23:38.286 --> 23:40.114
Oh, it's my pleasure, Chuck.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.421
Your father was one
of my closest friends.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.683
Which is why I was hoping

23:43.770 --> 23:44.988
you could help me
with something.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.642
My father was
a member of a club.

23:46.729 --> 23:47.643
Well, I can get you off
the waiting list

23:47.730 --> 23:49.166

- Just name it.
- I'm not talking racket sports.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.214
This is a gentlemen's club.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.303
As it happens,
Carter Baizen is a member too.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.783
I'm not acquainted
with Mr. Baizen.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.220

23:59.307 --> 24:00.961

24:01.048 --> 24:02.702
I don't remember
when I left.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.052
And I don't know anything
about a gentlemen's club.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.750
The club moves every month.
There are girls there.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.623
My. My, my.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.147
Well, Chuck..

24:14.801 --> 24:17.281
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.848
Someone I care about
is in trouble

24:18.935 --> 24:21.024
and this club has
something to do with it.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.636
Now knowing my father
was a member it only stands

24:23.723 --> 24:25.812
to reason that his closest
friends were too.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.423
When I go to the authorities

24:28.510 --> 24:31.078
I'll have to suggest
they investigate everyone.

I'm sorry about your friend..

Remember, being onstage..

25:30.616 --> 25:32.966
is like standing
on the edge of a cliff.

25:33.053 --> 25:37.013
What saves you

I'm sorry.

explanation is "sorry"?

Nate, what is going on?

26:05.955 --> 26:08.523
Nate, I told you,
your character went bankrupt

26:08.610 --> 26:10.612
suffered total
public humiliation.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.701
Not that you would
understand that.

26:12.788 --> 26:17.532
The characters in this play are
smoldering tempests of emotion.

No. I gotta go work on my
smoldering tempest of emotion.

Don't you think
that was a little harsh?

to get performances.

seeking revenge

your chances--

may seem not everyone spends

you get in my face.

lost all of our money

30:01.669 --> 30:04.193

for embezzlement.

what you do next.'

T-that's great.
Thank you for coming.

31:26.319 --> 31:29.061
Wow! That was
a whole new level of fake.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.237
I'm gonna look
for my boyfriend. Good job.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.198
[chuckles]

31:36.285 --> 31:39.723
You know, I don't know
why I ever had a crush on you.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.638

31:41.725 --> 31:42.813
I'm gay.

Nate, what..

31:55.261 --> 31:56.827
What happened up there?

31:59.308 --> 32:00.919
I know you're into him,
and I get it.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.355
'I mean, he's older,
he's smarter'

32:02.442 --> 32:04.357
'and you guys like
the same stuff.'

32:04.444 --> 32:06.837
- I can't compete.
- Y-you what?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.143
[sighs]

32:08.230 --> 32:09.840
I came to the gallery today

32:09.928 --> 32:11.190
and heard you on the phone.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.497
Oh, my God.
Are you talking about Julian?

32:14.584 --> 32:16.412
I was talking to Serena.
She was with him.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.414
She's the one
who likes him, not me.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.677
This is
a total misunderstanding.

32:23.811 --> 32:24.986
[sighs]

32:27.510 --> 32:29.599
Well, you know..

32:29.686 --> 32:31.993
...that doesn't
change the facts.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.603
Alright? I mean,
we have nothing in common.

32:34.822 --> 32:38.565
I like ESPN,
okay, and you like..

32:38.652 --> 32:39.827
...books and movies.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.482
The way you say that..

32:42.569 --> 32:44.353
you didn't even bother to read
"Age Of Innocence."

32:44.440 --> 32:46.051
you didn't watch the DVD
I gave you.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.574
You're like a kid
who swears he hates tomatoes

32:47.661 --> 32:49.706
and has never even
tried one.

32:50.751 --> 32:51.882
Well..

32:53.493 --> 32:55.147
...maybe you should be
with a guy like Julian

32:55.234 --> 32:57.584
who already likes tomatoes.

32:57.671 --> 33:00.848
Maybe if you would
put in some effort

33:00.935 --> 33:02.458
you wouldn't be so insecure.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.467
Elle.

33:11.554 --> 33:12.860
- Chuck.
- How did you..

33:12.947 --> 33:14.862
Escape? Turns out
they didn't want to hurt me.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.820
They just wanted me
to sign an agreement.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.040
They gave me some cash
and told me to get out of town.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.173
That's great.
Sao Paulo awaits.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.957
- Sao Paulo?
- Brazil.

33:23.044 --> 33:25.264
I can still help you get settled
and we can make a plan together.

33:25.351 --> 33:29.094
Chuck, I am really grateful
that you were willing to help me

33:29.181 --> 33:31.835
but all I needed was
someone to give me money.

33:31.922 --> 33:35.317
Now I have more than enough,
and I've already made a plan..

33:35.404 --> 33:36.797
...by myself.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.847
So you were just using me?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.678
You've got a good heart.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.158
You should give it
to somebody who cares.

33:51.507 --> 33:54.032
[intense music]

33:59.950 --> 34:01.822
- Hi.
- That was some performance.

34:01.909 --> 34:02.953
It was nothing
compared to yours.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.172
What do you mean?

34:07.175 --> 34:09.351
You called Yale, sent the blast
in to "Gossip Girl"

34:09.438 --> 34:11.658
to get revenge on Blair.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.138
I believed in you.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.183
All your talk about
integrity and ideals.

34:15.270 --> 34:19.492
My ideals? Blair spread false
rumors, blackmailed the school

34:19.579 --> 34:22.060
turned my job into a sham
with no repercussions.

34:23.322 --> 34:24.888
You're just as bad
as she is.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.368
No, you're, you're worse.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.283
Blair is a high schooler.
You're an adult.

34:28.370 --> 34:29.328
You need to fix things
with Blair.

34:29.415 --> 34:30.677
Absolutely not.

34:35.421 --> 34:36.726
[sighs]

34:39.207 --> 34:40.861
You know how you felt
when your ideals were crushed?

34:40.948 --> 34:43.429
Well, congratulations.
You've crushed mine.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.261
Hey, Blair. It's-it's Rachel
who's been messing with you.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.132
And we had sex
in the costume closet

34:51.219 --> 34:53.091
so you can do whatever
you want with that.

34:56.529 --> 34:59.184

35:07.017 --> 35:09.150
Student sex

35:09.237 --> 35:11.370
Is that what they mean
by Heartland values?

35:15.417 --> 35:17.332
- I at least expected a denial.
- No.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.857
I don't deny it.

35:20.944 --> 35:25.384
Well, the headmistress told me
my fate at Yale is sealed.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.865
So the question is how do I make
your fate as bleak as mine?

35:30.954 --> 35:32.478
I don't know
what's happened to me. I..

35:34.349 --> 35:36.046
...don't know
what I've become. I'm..

35:38.005 --> 35:39.267
...so sorry.

35:40.442 --> 35:43.141
[instrumental music]

35:52.498 --> 35:53.977
Well, your punishment is..

35:56.850 --> 35:57.807
...just..

35:58.808 --> 35:59.940
...live with it.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.725
I should know.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.337
It's not easy.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.393
Serena.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.178
So just so you know,
Blair isn't responsible

36:20.265 --> 36:22.441
for-for sending out
that blast about Yale.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.575
- I am.
- You?

36:26.662 --> 36:28.621
Yeah, well, I told Rachel
about Yale

36:28.708 --> 36:30.144
wanting to put out
the press release

36:30.231 --> 36:32.842
and...she sent it in
to "Gossip Girl."

36:32.929 --> 36:34.366
But Why-why
would you do that?

36:34.453 --> 36:36.063
I was trying to explain
to her that you

36:36.150 --> 36:37.456
aren't like
the other girls here and--

36:37.543 --> 36:39.632
I, I gotta go find Blair.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.155
Thank you for telling me.

'And I get it if you don't want
to talk to me right now'

36:58.172 --> 37:00.827
but the fact is,
I come bearing snacks..

37:03.569 --> 37:07.703
...hoping that we can cuddle
on the couch and watch ESPN.

just looking out for me.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.795
And Rachel,
well, she, uh..

37:55.882 --> 37:57.057
...She turned out to be
not who I thought she was

37:57.144 --> 37:58.450

I'm sorry too, son.

38:03.498 --> 38:06.414
Dad, you-you were right
about this

38:06.501 --> 38:08.851
but I think you..

38:08.938 --> 38:12.072
...need to give me space
to make my own mistakes.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.378
Well..

38:15.162 --> 38:17.556
...lucky for you,
you'll be at Yale soon.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.760
I know that was Rachel that sent
the "Gossip Girl" blast.

I'm sorry,
I didn't believe you.

Believe me.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.949
Nine times out of ten,
I would have sent the blast.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.996
Like you said,
betrayal's in my nature.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.564
- I didn't mean this.
- Spare me, Serena.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.394
I don't need a stirring
speech telling me

39:13.481 --> 39:15.135
what a good person I am.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.442
I know, I'm not.

is the karmaI've earned.

to love.

at the role of messenger
