{\an1}&gt;&gt; "TRUE JACKSON, VP"

00:02.936 --> 00:03.803
{\an1}WAS FILMED IN FRONT

00:03.870 --> 00:05.939
{\an1}OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.005 --> 00:06.806
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HAD THE COOLEST DREAM

00:06.873 --> 00:07.907
{\an1}LAST NIGHT.

00:07.974 --> 00:08.842
{\an1}I HAD LUNCH WITH LINCOLN

00:08.908 --> 00:10.276
{\an1}AND EINSTEIN.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.044
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

00:11.111 --> 00:11.845
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH AND THEN

00:11.911 --> 00:13.079
{\an1}LINCOLN LOOKED AWAY FOR A MINUTE

00:13.146 --> 00:14.180
{\an1}AND I PUT A ROACH IN HIS

00:14.247 --> 00:18.718
{\an1}SANDWICH AND HE ATE IT!

00:18.785 --> 00:20.253
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.388
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH AND THEN,

00:21.454 --> 00:22.789
{\an1}EINSTEIN GOT SO GROSSED OUT

00:22.856 --> 00:26.092
{\an1}THAT HE THREW UP ON TIGER WOODS.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.927
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TIGER WOODS WAS THERE TOO?

00:27.994 --> 00:29.262
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE WAS SITTING

00:29.329 --> 00:30.363
{\an1}ON A UNICORN,

00:30.430 --> 00:31.398
{\an1}AND THEN THE UNICORN

00:31.464 --> 00:33.933
{\an1}POOPED IN LINCOLN'S HAT.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.838
{\an1}THREE WORDS, "BEST DREAM EVER!"

00:38.905 --> 00:40.039
{\an1}[KNOCK ON DOOR]

00:40.106 --> 00:41.241
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GOT SOME MAIL FOR YOU, TRUE.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.076
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANKS, JIMMY.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.644
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.612
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S

00:45.678 --> 00:46.446
{\an1}AN INVITATION OR SOMETHING.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.881
{\an1}IT'S PRETTY FANCY, HUH?

00:47.947 --> 00:49.149
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU THINK THAT'S FANCY?

00:49.215 --> 00:50.116
{\an1}FOR MY FRIEND'S SWEET SIXTEEN,

00:50.183 --> 00:50.984
{\an1}SHE SENT EVERYONE

00:51.050 --> 00:52.152
{\an1}A GIANT BALLOON AND INSIDE WAS

00:52.218 --> 00:52.986
{\an1}A LIVE BUTTERFLY

00:53.052 --> 00:54.087
{\an1}WITH THE INVITATION

00:54.154 --> 00:55.088
{\an1}IN ITS MOUTH.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.056
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HUH? WHAT KIND OF POSTAGE

00:57.123 --> 00:58.925
{\an1}DID IT HAVE?

00:58.992 --> 00:59.993
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T REMEMBER.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.294
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NEXT TIME YOU SEE HER,

01:01.361 --> 01:02.662
{\an1}ASK HER, ALL RIGHT?

01:02.729 --> 01:04.631
{\an1}UNBELIEVABLE.

01:04.697 --> 01:09.869
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAN, THAT GUY LOVES MAIL.

01:09.936 --> 01:10.603
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TICKETS

01:10.670 --> 01:12.372
{\an1}TO THE "LAST MINUTE BALL."

01:12.439 --> 01:13.072

01:17.343 --> 01:18.178
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TONIGHT.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.379
{\an1}THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT

01:19.446 --> 01:20.547
{\an1}"THE LAST MINUTE BALL."

01:20.613 --> 01:21.114
{\an1}NO ONE GETS A TICKET

01:21.181 --> 01:22.348
{\an1}TO THE LAST MINUTE.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.183

{\an1}"YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE BALL"

01:24.083 --> 01:25.018

{\an1}HE'S JUST KISSING UP TO YOU

06:06.566 --> 06:09.235
{\an1}BECAUSE HE WANTS YOUR TICKET.

06:09.302 --> 06:25.518
{\an1}YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO CUTE TODAY.

06:25.585 --> 06:28.287
{\an1}&gt;&gt; STOP! I HAVE PRECISELY

06:28.354 --> 06:29.889
{\an1}SIX MINUTES TO EAT MY SANDWICH.

06:29.956 --> 06:32.492
{\an1}PLEASE STOP DISTRACTING ME.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.026
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WAS JUST STIRRING.

06:34.093 --> 06:34.660
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT KIND OF STIRRING

06:34.727 --> 06:35.762
{\an1}LEADS TO CHITCHAT

06:35.828 --> 06:40.600
{\an1}AND I DON'T HAVE TIME.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.835
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO, UM--

06:42.902 --> 06:44.370
{\an1}SOME WEATHER WE'RE HAVING, HUH?

06:44.437 --> 06:45.338
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU INSANE?

06:45.404 --> 06:46.005
{\an1}I TOLD YOU, I DON'T

06:46.072 --> 06:47.206
{\an1}WANT TO TALK.

06:47.273 --> 06:52.478

06:52.545 --> 06:57.917
{\an1}[SCREAMS]

06:57.984 --> 07:00.286
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.721
{\an1}OSCAR, YOU MISSED IT.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.555
{\an1}I JUST PULLED

07:02.622 --> 07:03.890
{\an1}THE GREATEST PRANK EVER

07:03.956 --> 07:04.857
{\an1}ON THE NEW GIRL, LAURA.

07:04.924 --> 07:05.958
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, SHE MENTIONED

07:06.025 --> 07:06.692
{\an1}SOMETHING ABOUT IT

07:06.759 --> 07:07.527
{\an1}ON HER WAY TO THE ELEVATOR.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.728
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DID SHE SAY?

07:08.795 --> 07:09.862
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I QUIT.

07:09.929 --> 07:10.830
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE

07:10.897 --> 07:12.031
{\an1}SAYING YOU QUIT,

07:12.098 --> 07:12.865

07:12.932 --> 07:14.233
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE SAID SHE CAN'T WORK HERE

07:14.300 --> 07:16.302
{\an1}AND SHE THREW THIS AT ME.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.504
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AMANDA WON'T CARE, RIGHT?

07:18.571 --> 07:20.406
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE'LL CARE, ALL RIGHT.

07:20.473 --> 07:21.307
{\an1}THIS IS THE FIRST ASSISTANT

07:21.374 --> 07:21.974
{\an1}WHO SEEMED LIKE

07:22.041 --> 07:22.775
{\an1}SHE WAS GOING TO WORK OUT.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.244
{\an1}AMANDA IS GOING TO BE FURIOUS.

07:25.311 --> 07:26.179
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T LIKE WHEN

07:26.245 --> 07:27.446
{\an1}SHE'S FURIOUS,

07:27.513 --> 07:28.848
{\an1}AH, JUST DON'T TELL HER, OKAY?

07:28.915 --> 07:29.515
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK SHE'S GOING

07:29.582 --> 07:30.483
{\an1}TO NOTICE THAT HER ASSISTANT

07:30.550 --> 07:31.417
{\an1}QUIT.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.451
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO QUIT?

07:32.518 --> 07:33.519
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR WAS THINKING

07:33.586 --> 07:34.821
{\an1}ABOUT QUITTING,

07:34.887 --> 07:36.489
{\an1}BUT I TALKED HIM OUT OF IT.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.356
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANKS AGAIN, RYAN.

07:37.423 --> 07:40.526
{\an1}I'VE DECIDED TO STAY.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.461
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HAS ANYONE SEEN LAURA?

07:42.528 --> 07:43.529
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UM, YES.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.566
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING

07:46.632 --> 07:50.203
{\an1}TO PULL FABRIC SWATCHES.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.205
{\an1}&gt;&gt; EXCELLENT, HAVE HER BRING

07:52.271 --> 07:57.476
{\an1}THEM TO ME RIGHT AWAY.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.311
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHERE WOULD I FIND

07:58.377 --> 07:59.011
{\an1}FABRICS SWATCHES?

07:59.078 --> 08:00.213
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IN THE DESIGN ROOM.

08:00.279 --> 08:01.247
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GREAT.

08:01.314 --> 08:06.152
{\an1}WHAT ARE FABRIC SWATCHES?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.854
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UH-OH, A ZIPPER.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.188
{\an1}HOW DOES IT GO AGAIN?

08:09.255 --> 08:11.991
{\an1}UPPIE ONI, DOWNIE OFFIE.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.392

08:13.459 --> 08:14.160
{\an1}MY COUSIN CAN ZIPPER,

08:14.227 --> 08:16.195
{\an1}AND HE'S ONLY THREE.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.597
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, SORRY, I THOUGHT

08:17.663 --> 08:18.564
{\an1}YOU WERE THAT AMANDA WOMAN.

08:18.631 --> 08:19.732
{\an1}I LOVE MESSING WITH HER.

08:19.799 --> 08:20.233
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT DOES HAVE

08:20.299 --> 08:22.735
{\an1}A CERTAIN SATISFACTION.

08:22.802 --> 08:23.469
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE WAS TREATING ME LIKE

08:23.536 --> 08:24.403
{\an1}I'M AN IDIOT,

08:24.470 --> 08:25.071
{\an1}JUST BECAUSE I'M MODEL.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.005
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU

08:26.072 --> 08:27.006
{\an1}FEEL ANY BETTER

08:27.073 --> 08:28.040

08:28.107 --> 08:28.841
{\an1}I'M AN IDIOT TOO

08:28.908 --> 08:30.509
{\an1}AND I'M A VICE PRESIDENT.

08:30.576 --> 08:31.177
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I HEARD ABOUT YOU.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.178
{\an1}MAX MADIGAN DISCOVERED YOU

08:32.245 --> 08:33.179
{\an1}IN THE LOBBY.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.780
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S ME, TRUE JACKSON, VP.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.248
{\an1}&gt;&gt; VIVIENNE.

08:35.313 --> 08:36.182
{\an1}NO LAST NAME, IT'S KIND

08:36.249 --> 08:38.284
{\an1}OF AN AFFECTATION.

08:38.351 --> 08:38.985
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU WANT TO HANG OUT

08:39.051 --> 08:39.452

08:42.455 --> 08:43.688

08:43.756 --> 08:44.590
{\an1}SHE'LL HUNT ME DOWN

08:44.657 --> 08:45.892
{\an1}AND DYE MY HAIR GREEN.

08:45.958 --> 08:46.592
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEN, YOU COULD BE

08:46.659 --> 08:47.093
{\an1}A MODEL ON MARS.

08:47.159 --> 08:47.693
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY

08:47.760 --> 08:51.564

08:59.672 --> 09:00.206
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

{\an1}YOU'RE AMANDA'S ASSISTANT?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.642
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S A LONG STORY.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.609
{\an1}I MADE LAURA QUIT,

09:03.676 --> 09:04.577
{\an1}NOW I'M COVERING

09:04.644 --> 09:06.545
{\an1}SO AMANDA DOESN'T FIND OUT.

09:06.612 --> 09:07.813
{\an1}OKAY, IT'S A MUCH SHORTER STORY

09:07.880 --> 09:09.482
{\an1}THAN I THOUGHT.

09:09.548 --> 09:10.583
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN, SHE'S GONNA FREAK.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.052

09:18.424 --> 09:19.392
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT

09:19.458 --> 09:27.533

09:27.600 --> 09:28.801
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, HEY JIMMY!

09:28.868 --> 09:30.002
{\an1}YOU ARE GONNA LOVE THIS.

{\an1}FROM ECUADOR.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.807

09:46.118 --> 09:46.719
{\an1}IT MIGHT BE FUN TO GO

09:46.786 --> 09:47.386
{\an1}WITH SOMEONE,

09:47.453 --> 09:48.020
{\an1}BUT THEN I WAS LIKE,

09:48.087 --> 09:49.522
{\an1}"NAH, I'LL JUST GO MYSELF."

09:49.588 --> 09:50.389
{\an1}AND THEN, I WAS THINKING

09:50.456 --> 09:51.190
{\an1}IT MIGHT BE FUN

09:51.257 --> 09:52.024
{\an1}TO GO WITH SOMEONE

09:52.091 --> 09:52.692
{\an1}BUT I WAS LIKE, "NAH,

09:54.393 --> 09:54.961
{\an1}I WAS THINKING--

09:55.027 --> 09:58.831
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JIMMY! IS THERE

{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S COOL, IT'S WAY COOL.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.242
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU REALLY THINK

10:10.309 --> 10:12.411
{\an1}I SHOULD ASK?

10:12.478 --> 10:16.449
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ASK AWAY?

10:16.515 --> 10:19.552

10:45.411 --> 10:46.746
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I'VE NEVER WORKED SO HARD

10:46.812 --> 10:47.747

{\an1}I REALLY NEED TO TALK.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.588
{\an1}I'M SO CONFUSED.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.822
{\an1}JIMMY CAME IN AND SAID

10:56.889 --> 10:57.656
{\an1}HE ALSO HAD TICKETS

10:57.723 --> 10:59.291

10:59.358 --> 10:59.925
{\an1}THEN, HE SAID HE WANTED

10:59.992 --> 11:01.060
{\an1}TO ASK SOMEONE HERE

11:01.127 --> 11:02.361
{\an1}AND WANTED TO KNOW IF I THOUGHT

11:02.428 --> 11:07.199
{\an1}IT WOULD BE COOL, THEN HE LEFT.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.401

11:16.742 --> 11:18.844
{\an1}IF JIMMY TAKES ME TO THE BALL,

11:18.911 --> 11:20.112
{\an1}YOU GUYS CAN HAVE MY TICKETS.

{\an1}ARE YOU OKAY?

19:31.937 --> 19:32.504
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SITTING ON THE FLOOR

19:32.571 --> 19:34.106
{\an1}IN A BALL GOWN.

19:34.172 --> 19:34.840
{\an1}WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

19:34.907 --> 19:37.609
{\an1}ANYTHING IS WRONG?

{\an1}&gt;&gt; I FEEL SO STUPID.

19:42.114 --> 19:46.385
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T SAY THAT.

19:46.451 --> 19:46.952
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I REALLY THOUGHT

19:47.019 --> 19:49.321
{\an1}HE WAS GOING TO ASK ME.

19:49.388 --> 19:49.821
{\an1}THE WHOLE TIME,

19:49.888 --> 19:51.490

{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HATE HER.

19:57.963 --> 19:58.931
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T.

19:58.997 --> 19:59.965
{\an1}I WISH I DID,

20:00.032 --> 20:06.338
{\an1}BUT I DON'T. SHE'S REALLY NICE.

20:06.405 --> 20:09.041
