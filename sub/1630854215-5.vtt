<i>Previously on</i>
The Good Doctor...

00:03.137 --> 00:06.574
You put me here,
and I'm really angry
about that.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.377
I am sitting in this chair
because of that surgery.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.612
- I enjoyed our field trip.
- I had a good time, too.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.149
I'm sorry. I just...

00:15.283 --> 00:16.217
I can't.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.020
I know
how to fix everything.

00:20.154 --> 00:23.324
There's a surgery
that will cure Lim's paralysis.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.498
It's not the cord.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.466
It's a deformity
of the spinal column.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.205
Even if there's kyphosis,
that doesn't mean--

00:37.338 --> 00:38.472
She used to have
a 10-degree curve.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.474
Now it's 15.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.144
So, what do you propose?

00:43.277 --> 00:45.045
We go through the abdomen
and chest, fix the deformity,

00:45.179 --> 00:47.581
and stabilize the column
with cage, plate, and screws.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.318
With the tension in the cord
relaxed, her body can heal.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.519
It will fix the paralysis.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.488
- That might work.
- Might.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.225
Might work.
Might doesn't cut it,

00:57.358 --> 00:59.893
especially with the amount
of instrumentation
around the spinal cord.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.396
You could
poke a hole in the gut
or in the lung.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.465
Sepsis is
a very real possibility.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.400
I won't poke a hole
in anything.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.869
Do I need to remind you
how confident
you were the last time?

01:11.172 --> 01:13.541
I'm sorry, but the odds
aren't good enough, not for me.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.846
Then better the odds.

01:18.979 --> 01:21.048
You two see if you can find
a surgery in our comfort zone.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.350
Any objections?

01:25.553 --> 01:26.720
No.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.389
Then I need to get started.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.591
I will be very busy this week.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.072
And you never fainted
before today?

01:45.206 --> 01:46.574
No, never.

01:47.975 --> 01:51.912
Actually, I guess
I fainted last week.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.881
I was at recess.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.550
I just sort of woke up
on the ground.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.354
I thought you wouldn't let me
do the Halloween pageant.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.557
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.126
We just want you to get better.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.530
So, you're Cinderella.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.333
I have the main solo.
I'm singing "No One Is Alone."

02:12.466 --> 02:15.269
Sondheim. I love it.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.670
What's your favorite?

02:18.439 --> 02:22.343
<i>♪ For what's the sound
Of the world out there? ♪</i>

02:22.476 --> 02:23.977
<i>♪ What, Mr. Todd?
What, Mr. Todd? ♪</i>

02:24.111 --> 02:25.613
<i>♪ What is that sound? ♪</i>

02:25.746 --> 02:28.749
<i>♪ The crunching noises
Pervading the air ♪</i>

02:28.882 --> 02:30.484
<i>♪ Yes, Mr. Todd!
Yes, Mr. Todd! ♪</i>

02:30.618 --> 02:32.286
<i>♪ Yes, all around! ♪</i>

02:32.420 --> 02:34.988
<i>♪ It's man devouring man
My dear! ♪</i>

02:35.122 --> 02:40.328
<i>♪ And who are we
To deny it in here! ♪</i>

02:42.730 --> 02:43.764
Why is there singing?

02:45.399 --> 02:48.569
And why are you... green?

02:48.702 --> 02:49.970
It's Halloween.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.343
Heart rate's still 38 BPM.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.978
Hopefully, we can get you back
in time for your solo.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.113
We can't.

03:00.248 --> 03:03.751
The electrical system
in your heart is malfunctioning
and you risk cardiac arrest.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.786
We can easily implant
a pacemaker today

03:05.919 --> 03:07.154
to keep it
functioning normally.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.989
Once it's in,
a pacemaker is very safe.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.592
W-Why is this happening to her?

03:11.725 --> 03:14.528
We will do blood work
and electrophysiologic studies

03:14.662 --> 03:15.763
to find out.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.831
Plus, genetic workups
on all three of you.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.200
If it's inherited,
you might be at risk, too.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.240
Happy Halloween.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.593
I get dizzy a lot

03:45.726 --> 03:47.561
'cause I banged my head
when I was a kid.

03:47.695 --> 03:48.562
They know, buddy.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.031
Oh, yeah.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.200
Sometimes I forget stuff, too.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.269
Chris is always
looking out for me.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.538
He picks me up
from day care every day.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.039
He cooks me dinner,

03:59.172 --> 04:00.674
and he lets me
play video games.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.311
Sounds like a good brother.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.046
Tell them what we say
to each other.

04:06.179 --> 04:09.850
I say, "I got your back,
little bro."

04:09.983 --> 04:12.286
And then I go,
"I got your back, big bro."

04:16.357 --> 04:17.891
Nice approximation
of the wound edges.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.126
You're good to go, Ollie.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.832
Back's been bugging me.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.066
Joys of aging.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.836
Your pants are pretty loose.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.471
Lost a little weight recently.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.705
When did you see a doctor last?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.074
I don't know.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.410
Between Ollie
and looking for work...

04:36.544 --> 04:37.411
Mind lifting up your shirt?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.221
We're gonna order lab tests
and a CT for you,

04:48.356 --> 04:49.523
just to be safe.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.696
That potential assistant
I liked, with the septum ring?

04:55.829 --> 04:56.864
Mm-hmm.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.666
Well, I watched her TikTok,

04:58.799 --> 04:59.733
and now I'm looking
for another one.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.405
You reading your tablet?

05:05.639 --> 05:06.940
Yes, but I'm also
listening to you.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.108
With the Dr. Lim surgery,

05:08.241 --> 05:10.077
I have to do two jobs.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.945
Well, how about you start
<i>after</i> our lunch?

05:16.216 --> 05:17.651
This is a growth opportunity.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.153
As a boss,
you need to delegate.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.790
You think I write
every line of code myself?

05:22.923 --> 05:26.760
I am a surgeon.
I cannot delegate surgery.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.562
So, figure out
the elements of your job

05:28.696 --> 05:31.264
that only you can do
and delegate the rest.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.002
That is a good idea.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.371
The Force is with me.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.809
Nice. Love it.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.478
Ooh. Gorgeous.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.481
So, the navy blue dress
or the black skirt?

05:47.615 --> 05:48.616
They're all great.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.118
Your date's
gonna be blown away.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.120
Not necessarily my date.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.522
My neighbors aren't taking me

05:54.655 --> 05:55.689
to romantic restaurants.

05:55.823 --> 05:56.557
Your neighbors

05:56.690 --> 05:57.958
are a 90-year-old couple

05:58.091 --> 06:01.194
and that hermit who likes
to talk to his geodes.

06:01.328 --> 06:01.962
It's a date, right?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.501
This is my floor.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.969
Wise answer, matey.

06:09.102 --> 06:09.803
Date.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.909
Date. Definitely a date.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.278
Which is a problem
'cause those outfits suck.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.080
What else you got?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.883
Trashy, frumpy, slutty,

06:23.016 --> 06:24.384
not slutty enough.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.020
God, no. Anything else?

06:28.321 --> 06:30.223
In my closet.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.825
We'll meet there. 8:00 p.m.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.632
<i>Try to hold still, Chris.</i>

06:38.766 --> 06:40.033
<i>This will just take
a few minutes.</i>

06:40.167 --> 06:40.834
Okay.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.875
I would have thought that you
had more Halloween spirit.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.643
Oh, I have a lot.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.545
But as a professional woman,

06:51.679 --> 06:53.481
I express it after work.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.248
- Interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.084
What are you up to?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.222
There's a big pub crawl
around San Pedro Square.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.356
A bunch of us are going.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.257
That sounds fun.

07:05.959 --> 07:06.860
Want to join?

07:08.829 --> 07:11.231
I think I'll skip. But thanks.

07:12.466 --> 07:13.501
No problem.

07:20.373 --> 07:21.909
I think I made things weird
between us last night.

07:24.377 --> 07:25.278
It's fine.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.519
A three-centimeter mass

07:31.652 --> 07:33.453
partially compressing
the bile duct.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.326
Pancreatic cancer.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.265
Hey.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.000
You wearing that in the OR?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.536
I got the genetic testing back.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.003
Skyler has hemochromatosis.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.271
Explains the heart problems.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.740
Yes, but look at
her parents' results.

07:53.907 --> 07:54.942
Mom carries the recessive gene.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.611
But not her dad.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.246
Which means he's not her dad.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.914
And given how
he let us test him,

08:01.048 --> 08:02.249
he doesn't know it.

08:09.056 --> 08:09.957
What are we gonna
tell her parents?

08:10.958 --> 08:13.493
The genetic
testing results.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.730
Placing the generator
in the infraclavicular pocket.

08:16.864 --> 08:17.998
Any thoughts on how?

08:18.131 --> 08:20.433
Without destroying
their marriage, I mean?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.672
I will delegate that task
to you two.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.307
It will be
a growth opportunity.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.979
You also need to inform
Skyler's biological father
that he's the carrier.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.114
Well,
we don't know who he is.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.851
Then it will be an even bigger
growth opportunity.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.487
Adsons and 3-0 vicryl.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.360
You have stage three
pancreatic cancer.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.262
That means
it hasn't metastasized yet,

08:49.396 --> 08:51.965
but it's spread
to your lymph nodes.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.603
So, I'll-- I'll do chemo?

08:55.736 --> 08:58.271
Chemo, radiation,
molecular therapy

08:58.405 --> 09:01.474
would give you
about eight months.

09:01.609 --> 09:04.511
There is
a very extensive surgery
called the Whipple procedure.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.379
It involves
removing your gallbladder

09:06.513 --> 09:09.249
as well as parts
of your bile duct,
pancreas, and intestines.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.052
Okay. When can we do it?

09:12.185 --> 09:15.222
It only has
a small chance of success,

09:15.355 --> 09:18.225
and if it fails, you'll have
less time and more pain.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.566
When Ollie was a kid,
my mom worked from home a lot.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.370
She always had me looking
after him, which I hated.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.240
One day,
I was reading comics...

09:36.309 --> 09:37.310
and he fell down the stairs.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.081
You were just a kid yourself.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.984
Ollie's injury
isn't your fault.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.524
I will do anything
to be there for him.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.796
We'll order the pre-op testing
for the Whipple procedure.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.104
I'm busy.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.774
No, you are waiting
on your patient's ear wax
to soften.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.242
We can use a thoracoscopic
and laparoscopic approach

10:09.376 --> 10:11.044
with endoscopic decompression.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.180
I want to present it
to Dr. Lim.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.481
No.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.150
This approach has been used
for tumor surgery.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.051
Did you say "surgery"?

10:18.185 --> 10:19.252
We're not talking about you!

10:19.386 --> 10:21.388
It's less invasive
than my initial idea,

10:21.521 --> 10:23.556
with a lower risk
of vascular injury.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.158
I said no, Shaun.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.161
This is wild.
It's like Rice Krispies
popping in my ear.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.633
I did what Dr. Andrews said.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.435
I lowered the risk of injury.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.137
You didn't do
what Dr. Andrews said.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.605
You didn't raise the chance

10:38.739 --> 10:41.274
- that we're gonna fix
her paralysis.
- Paralysis?

10:41.408 --> 10:43.977
- I am not talking about you.
- We're not talking about you!
Tilt your head.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.047
Not good enough.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.561
Jacob will be back soon.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.831
Let's start with us.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.132
The pacemaker is working great.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.600
Thank God.

11:07.735 --> 11:11.404
But she has a genetic disease
called hemochromatosis.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.507
Um, excess iron
is building up in her body.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.777
That's why she was
having heart issues?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.145
Yeah.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.113
And there's a small amount
of damage to her liver,

11:20.247 --> 11:23.016
but it looks like
we caught that in time.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.651
Iron is carried
in red blood cells,

11:24.785 --> 11:27.287
so the main treatment
is just regular blood draws.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.622
That's it? Great.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.362
Because of the forms
you signed,

11:35.495 --> 11:38.398
we're supposed
to tell you and your husband
these results together

11:38.531 --> 11:39.933
and explain
that hemochromatosis

11:40.067 --> 11:41.969
is a recessive
genetic disorder,

11:42.102 --> 11:44.337
which means that for Skyler
to have the condition,

11:44.471 --> 11:46.639
the gene needs to be carried
by both parents.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.943
And then we'd explain
that you carry it,

11:50.077 --> 11:53.146
but... your husband doesn't.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.650
But that doesn't...

12:01.454 --> 12:02.222
Oh, God.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.724
Oh, God.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.836
Jacob's old college roommate.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.339
We were really close
with him and his wife.

12:21.308 --> 12:25.445
Jacob suspected,
but I denied it.

12:28.015 --> 12:31.184
He was just so amazing,
and I was in a rut.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.923
Jacob and I are good now.

12:36.056 --> 12:40.293
Skyler is his daughter.
I don't want that to change.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.831
We can't avoid your husband
finding out his test results.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.468
Can you give us
the biological dad's info?

12:49.903 --> 12:52.072
He needs to know
he's a carrier.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.475
I don't want him involved.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.545
We can't tell him anything
about you or Skyler.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.647
Privacy laws.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.383
But if he has other children,
they could be in danger.

13:06.719 --> 13:07.620
Mick Kang.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.463
I better go
talk to my husband now.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.810
Are you trying to look
like a stalk of celery?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.182
- Oh.
- Ohh!

13:35.315 --> 13:37.550
My go-to in the before times.

13:38.952 --> 13:39.819
Pair it with...

13:39.953 --> 13:41.288
The Louis Vuitton blouse?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.391
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

13:44.524 --> 13:48.028
And... these.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.696
Hot, classic.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.697
Well done.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.467
Only issue--

13:54.601 --> 13:56.603
They could be hard to get off.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.271
A feature or a bug, depending.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.674
Let's take a break.

14:02.876 --> 14:03.944
What's going on?

14:06.813 --> 14:09.917
I'm a different person now,
with a different body.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.019
That he apparently
finds attractive.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.053
You'll figure it out.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.688
It's not only sex.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.493
I worry I'm just racing
to start my life again.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.133
How much do I even like him?

14:27.767 --> 14:28.835
Is he a nice guy?

14:28.969 --> 14:29.736
Definitely.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.637
Cute?

14:30.770 --> 14:31.671
Pretty cute.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.576
Having just lost a nice
and pretty cute guy,

14:38.578 --> 14:39.879
it goes a long way.

14:43.816 --> 14:44.851
This'll work.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.923
Doesn't look like
we can preserve the pylorus.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.691
We can reassess
early in the surgery.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.699
I was an idiot the other night.

15:01.201 --> 15:01.969
When I almost kissed you.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.339
Obviously, I like you.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.176
But it's a line I can't cross.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.812
If this is because
we work together...

15:12.946 --> 15:13.713
It's not.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.517
I can't date anyone right now.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.022
But I really hope
we can keep being friends.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.791
Okay.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.631
- If we don't do a distal,
we run the risk of--
- Hold up.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.536
We clearly
both like each other,

15:36.669 --> 15:38.538
but nothing can happen

15:38.671 --> 15:40.440
for some reason
you won't share.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.176
But you still want to hang out?

15:44.744 --> 15:45.545
Yeah.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.083
Let's look at
the common hepatic artery.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.570
Our other growth opportunity's
waiting in the cafeteria.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.114
You think
I carry a gene for this...

16:21.248 --> 16:22.115
Hemochromatosis.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.517
So, if you have kids...

16:24.651 --> 16:26.319
Yeah, two boys.
Six-year-old twins.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.388
The warning signs
would be bronzed skin,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.157
liver problems,
lack of energy, joint pain.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.924
No.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.127
As far as I know,
they're totally healthy.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.463
How did you find out
I'm a carrier?

16:36.596 --> 16:37.930
I've never even been
to this hospital.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.367
I'm sorry.
We're limited by privacy laws.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.001
But as long as
you and your kids

16:42.135 --> 16:44.003
get checked out,
you'll be fine.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.806
Privacy laws?
Who-- Whose privacy?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.908
I'm sorry.
We can't say anything more.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.345
Jacob?

16:55.582 --> 16:56.449
Daisy had a kid?

17:00.687 --> 17:03.190
Hey, look, man, um, they just--
they called me in here.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.524
- I didn't--
- No!

17:04.657 --> 17:05.992
No, no, no, no, no. Don't!

17:06.126 --> 17:07.194
Ah!

17:18.105 --> 17:20.273
Okay, residents,
that did not work at all.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.975
You chose
a very bad place to meet Mick,

17:23.110 --> 17:24.444
and then Mick
got his nose broken,

17:24.577 --> 17:26.213
and then Mick complained
that you got his nose broken,

17:26.346 --> 17:28.981
and then Dr. Andrews
berated me for not
being a good attending

17:29.116 --> 17:31.684
when all I did was delegate
to the two of you.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.353
She suggested meeting him
in the cafeteria.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.621
And you didn't object.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.223
As a feminist,
it's not my place to--

17:36.356 --> 17:38.057
You both did terrible jobs.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.660
I have to work
on Dr. Lim's surgery.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.362
Go check on Skyler's pacemaker.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.840
I can see
the common hepatic artery.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.875
Resecting
the large lymph node
anterior to it.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.183
Dr. Park,
the abdominal wall.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.390
That's not local spread.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.364
Metastasis.
We can't finish.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.399
We have to close him up,
reverse what we can.

18:23.736 --> 18:27.340
We will go in posteriorly
at T9-L1.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.276
With no anterior instrumentation,

18:29.409 --> 18:31.711
she'll be at a lower risk
of postsurgical complications,

18:31.844 --> 18:33.546
and her prognosis
will be improved

18:33.680 --> 18:35.415
by completing
posterior osteotomies

18:35.548 --> 18:37.016
to release tension on the cord.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.620
Still too risky.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.522
Have you even apologized
to Lim yet?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.424
I have nothing
to apologize for.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.326
Oh, my God. Shaun.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.761
Oh, you are still mad at me
for not following orders.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.830
That's why you keep
shooting down my ideas.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.632
You didn't listen to me,

18:52.765 --> 18:55.202
and you're refusing
to accept responsibility,
so yeah, I'm a little mad,

18:55.335 --> 18:56.703
but I'm shooting down
your ideas

18:56.836 --> 18:58.538
because they're too risky.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.573
I don't believe that.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.409
Okay, fine,
don't believe it, then.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.744
I want you
to stop being mad at me

19:04.877 --> 19:06.679
so you will
like my ideas again.

19:06.813 --> 19:07.780
Doesn't work that way.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.649
Then how does it work?

19:09.782 --> 19:11.584
How long are you going
to be mad at me?

19:11.718 --> 19:12.585
I don't know.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.424
I'm gonna go finish
my clinic hours.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.900
Is there something wrong
with her pacemaker?

19:29.636 --> 19:30.603
Her heart is fine.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.006
She has jaundice.
Her liver is failing.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.013
Hypotension
from the heart block

19:41.147 --> 19:42.815
caused unexpected shock liver.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.751
She has been listed
for a transplant on UNOS.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.386
I've asked for an exception
to speed it up,

19:46.519 --> 19:47.720
but at this rate, she will die

19:47.854 --> 19:49.556
before a donor liver
becomes available.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.023
We tested her mom.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.359
She's not a good match,

19:52.492 --> 19:55.628
and her dad isn't either,
since he's not her dad.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.797
What about
her biological father?

19:57.930 --> 20:00.300
The mom's been calling him,
but apparently he blocked her.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.202
We could try.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.837
You got him
punched in the face.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.907
I will talk with him instead.

20:10.176 --> 20:14.614
No. Y-You said before
that I might have eight months.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.449
We didn't know
it had metastasized.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.755
I always said
I wouldn't do this to him.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.657
You're not doing
anything to him. You're sick.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.860
He's gonna wind up
in a group home.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.062
There are good ones.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.600
Patient Services
can advise you.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.842
Should we get your brother
so you two can talk?

20:47.547 --> 20:48.348
Yeah.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.694
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

21:05.532 --> 21:06.399
Patient of mine...

21:08.200 --> 21:10.637
he's devoted his life
to taking care of his brother,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.739
who's got
a traumatic brain injury,

21:12.872 --> 21:14.741
but he's dying
of pancreatic cancer
and he's terrified.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.609
The Whipple procedure
is the only--

21:16.743 --> 21:18.077
This isn't a surgical question.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.080
I was hoping
you'd talk to them.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.385
About your experiences
with Steve,

21:26.353 --> 21:27.887
and after he died.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.558
Why?

21:31.691 --> 21:33.760
It would be great
for them to see
how well you've turned out.

21:35.395 --> 21:39.332
I don't know his brother
will turn out well.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.469
I have ASD,
but he has a brain injury.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.070
- I know, but--
- I lived in a bus.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.237
I don't know where they live,

21:45.372 --> 21:46.873
but it is almost certainly
not a bus

21:47.006 --> 21:48.040
or you would have
already mentioned it.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.779
I still think it could help.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.516
It's much more likely
I can help with fixing
Dr. Lim's paralysis.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.750
Your patient is dying anyway.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.655
Why are you in this office?

22:04.624 --> 22:05.492
I have a meeting.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.107
You're making this worse
with Shaun.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.675
You do realize that, don't you?

22:22.809 --> 22:24.110
You're making him more upset.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.278
He's got to take responsibility
for what he did.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.480
He's trying.

22:27.614 --> 22:28.781
And you staying pissed at him

22:28.915 --> 22:29.982
isn't going to
help that process.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.984
Which is exactly why
I'm gonna stay away.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.453
Well, you can't
avoid him forever.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.954
- Yes, I can.
- Stop it!

22:38.357 --> 22:39.392
You're mad at him.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.893
He's not going to apologize.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.495
Someone's got to make
the first move.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.530
And that has got to be me?

22:43.663 --> 22:44.897
Yeah, of course it does.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.600
He's a grown man,
and he's your husband.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.437
He has ASD, and he's your son.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.175
Your daughter
is in liver failure.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.512
None of her relatives
are suitable donors,
but you might be.

23:01.448 --> 23:02.849
You want me to give my liver?

23:02.982 --> 23:05.117
Just one lobe.
The full liver would kill you.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.019
I've never met her.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.556
I mean, I...

23:09.689 --> 23:11.891
I only heard about her
a couple days ago.

23:12.024 --> 23:15.728
Okay, you're--
you're biologically linked.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.464
That gives you responsibility.

23:18.998 --> 23:22.034
I have two little boys
who need me,

23:22.168 --> 23:24.537
a wife I'm already
in couples therapy with.

23:26.806 --> 23:27.840
I feel sorry for this girl.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.009
I really do.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.044
But I cannot destroy
my family for her.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.866
My brother's going to be okay.
We're going on a trip.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.744
Ollie,

24:04.877 --> 24:07.714
how about Nurse Hawks here
takes you to the cafeteria
to get some ice cream, hmm?

24:09.015 --> 24:09.782
Sundae?

24:09.916 --> 24:10.883
Go for it.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.627
I found a website
for a clinic in Mexico

24:20.760 --> 24:22.061
that offers a cure
for pancreatic cancer.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.800
Immunotherapy,
stem cells, supplements.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.836
I know these clinics.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.671
They're scams
preying on desperate people.

24:32.639 --> 24:33.472
What do I have to lose?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.908
Your money, for one thing.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.912
Your brother will need it
after you're gone.

24:41.548 --> 24:42.815
If he loses me...

24:45.151 --> 24:46.252
he'll never make it.

24:46.385 --> 24:47.119
He will.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.823
You don't understand.

24:53.359 --> 24:56.563
Growing up, um,
my family was really close.

24:57.764 --> 24:58.931
We worked the farm together.

25:00.266 --> 25:00.933
My brother...

25:02.268 --> 25:03.502
My brother was my best friend.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.306
One day, the tractor rolled,

25:07.439 --> 25:10.142
and my brother herniated a disk
getting it back up.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.979
Doctor gave him Oxy,

25:14.246 --> 25:16.315
and 18 months later
he moved on to heroin.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.285
Counselors, they, um--

25:19.418 --> 25:23.322
they told me, my mom,
my dad to cut him off,

25:23.455 --> 25:25.024
that he needed
to hit rock bottom.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.526
So we did.

25:29.095 --> 25:29.862
And he did.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.198
For a while there,

25:33.766 --> 25:34.967
it felt like he was gone.

25:37.904 --> 25:38.971
My brother tells me now

25:40.907 --> 25:41.874
that our family's love,

25:43.142 --> 25:44.043
everything my parents
taught him,

25:45.845 --> 25:46.746
that's what got him through.

25:49.816 --> 25:50.983
We saved him,

25:52.118 --> 25:53.152
even when we weren't there.

25:55.755 --> 25:56.989
Last month, he actually, um--

25:58.124 --> 25:59.859
he marked five years sober.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.497
Ollie can handle this.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.637
Tell him the truth.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.277
- Don't argue with me.
- I'm not!

26:18.410 --> 26:20.012
Stop acting like a brat.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.016
Let's go now.

26:25.852 --> 26:26.686
<i>That was school.</i>

26:27.854 --> 26:29.555
You hit Susan Dawkins again?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.724
She was being mean to me,
like she always is.

26:31.858 --> 26:33.359
Well, we talked
about this, Maddie.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.962
All you got to do is--
is stay away.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.596
Why do I
have to change what <i>I</i> do

26:37.730 --> 26:38.865
when she's the one who's mean?

26:38.998 --> 26:41.934
Because hitting people
isn't acceptable, Maddie.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.436
Sometimes in life,
people are gonna be mean.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.005
You always
make everything my fault.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.039
No, I don't.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.407
You're supposed
to be on my side.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.309
I'm trying to be on your side,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.144
but you make it
damn near impossible

26:52.278 --> 26:53.980
because you never listen to me!

26:54.113 --> 26:56.248
You don't listen.
You just boss me around.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.050
Oh, my God. Okay.
You know what?

26:58.184 --> 26:59.952
- Just go to your room.
- No.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.490
What did you say to me?
Go to your room.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.825
I hate you.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.561
I said go to your room!

27:25.377 --> 27:27.379
Hepatic encephalopathy.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.315
Without a new liver,
she'll be dead by tomorrow.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.418
Did you get the exception
from UNOS?

27:32.551 --> 27:33.252
No.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.087
Then it's over.

27:35.587 --> 27:38.124
It's not.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.760
Her biological father
could still be a match.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.830
First, you two
failed with Mick,

27:43.963 --> 27:45.297
then I failed with Mick.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.144
Ollie...

27:59.311 --> 28:00.412
we're not gonna go to Mexico.

28:02.648 --> 28:03.182
Are you better?

28:06.986 --> 28:07.820
No.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.123
Are you dying?

28:15.494 --> 28:16.328
Yeah.

28:18.464 --> 28:21.567
But we are gonna spend
every minute together.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.138
And I'm gonna find you
a great group home.

28:28.074 --> 28:28.941
And I know that's hard.

28:32.578 --> 28:33.712
Ollie, I am so sorry.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.152
Rajan's in a group home.

28:42.989 --> 28:43.856
Rajan.

28:45.858 --> 28:46.658
From my day group.

28:49.796 --> 28:53.165
He says
he's got his own bedroom

28:54.867 --> 28:55.868
and the people are nice.

29:00.773 --> 29:01.974
He's okay.

29:07.679 --> 29:08.948
I got your back, big bro.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.086
I got <i>your</i> back, little bro.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.208
Can I come in?

29:41.213 --> 29:43.582
I <i>am</i> mad at you.

29:44.683 --> 29:46.018
And for good reason.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.619
But no matter how mad I get,

29:48.687 --> 29:51.023
I never stop loving you.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.227
I didn't tell that
to Maddie enough.

30:01.767 --> 30:06.238
I don't know what you want me
to take away from that.

30:08.740 --> 30:09.641
That I love you.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.247
I do too.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.252
And that I had good reasons,

30:20.953 --> 30:22.788
non-emotional reasons,

30:22.922 --> 30:25.624
for shooting down
your earlier ideas.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.794
But I think
there might be something
to that endoscopic plan, maybe.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.796
Do you have
any of her CT scans?

30:30.930 --> 30:31.864
I have many of them.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.267
Well, let's start with one.

30:45.344 --> 30:48.180
<i>♪ Today might be the day ♪</i>

30:51.717 --> 30:56.889
<i>♪ Everything turns around ♪</i>

31:01.027 --> 31:01.793
Thanks for coming out, guys.

31:12.638 --> 31:13.539
That was beautiful.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.307
Thanks.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.743
- I'm Lea.
- Mick.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.479
- First time at the show?
- Yeah.

31:21.180 --> 31:21.981
Yeah.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.153
Uh, can I--
can I show you something?

31:28.120 --> 31:28.887
Sure.

31:34.226 --> 31:38.397
<i>♪ Mother cannot guide you ♪</i>

31:38.530 --> 31:41.500
<i>♪ Now you're on your own... ♪</i>

31:43.035 --> 31:46.338
Wow. She's... incredible.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.240
Your daughter?

31:48.740 --> 31:49.775
N-No.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.911
<i>♪ No one is alone ♪</i>

31:53.045 --> 31:54.146
Yours.

31:55.281 --> 32:00.419
<i>♪ Truly, no one is alone ♪</i>

32:00.552 --> 32:05.257
<i>♪ Mother isn't here now ♪</i>

32:05.391 --> 32:08.727
<i>♪ Who knows what she'd say? ♪</i>

32:08.860 --> 32:12.264
We'll go in posteriorly
with minimally invasive
percutaneous screws

32:12.398 --> 32:14.300
and do a complete
vertebral column resection

32:14.433 --> 32:16.735
at the maximally
kyphosed segments,

32:16.868 --> 32:19.371
then reconstruct
the vertebral bodies
with an expandable cage.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.074
You're building
a whole new spinal column.

32:22.208 --> 32:25.777
It's the safest way to remove
the tension in your cord

32:25.911 --> 32:27.379
and let your body do its work.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.548
You came around?

32:29.681 --> 32:31.383
I wouldn't say
I came around exactly,

32:31.517 --> 32:34.320
but I don't think
it's crazy to say yes.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.055
At this point,
it's not a medical question.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.124
It's an emotional one.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.392
You got to ask yourself,
how bad do you want
out of that chair?

32:43.695 --> 32:44.463
I'll think on it.

32:52.871 --> 32:53.572
You look...

32:55.074 --> 32:56.875
I'm gonna use
a highly precise term here...

32:58.010 --> 32:59.611
snazzy.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.581
Well, I spent hours applying
very expensive snazz.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.750
You look great, too.

33:04.883 --> 33:05.917
Thanks.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.325
Reservation for two
under Joseph.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.430
One moment.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.435
Is this the only entrance
into the dining room?

33:23.569 --> 33:26.338
It's an old building.
I'm so sorry.

33:26.472 --> 33:27.773
A couple of waiters
are coming down right now.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.741
They'll carry you
and the chair upstairs.

33:29.875 --> 33:30.509
It's no problem.

33:31.743 --> 33:32.444
Um...

33:35.681 --> 33:38.417
You know, I have always loved

33:38.550 --> 33:40.652
this little courtyard area
out here.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.021
Could you possibly bring down
one of those corner tables

33:43.155 --> 33:44.790
and a couple of chairs?

33:44.923 --> 33:48.227
Uh, just one, actually.
I come equipped.

33:50.329 --> 33:51.797
I'll make it happen.

33:51.930 --> 33:52.731
Thank you.

34:41.213 --> 34:44.250
<i>A New Hope</i> is,
of course, a perfect movie.

34:44.383 --> 34:45.217
Correct.

34:46.185 --> 34:49.788
But, talking about
the recent ones,

34:49.921 --> 34:53.192
ah, there's one that,
for me, really stands out.

34:53.325 --> 34:54.092
<i>Rogue One.</i>

34:55.026 --> 34:56.895
Yes! Oh!

34:58.230 --> 34:59.531
Oh, that ending!

35:00.399 --> 35:01.800
Genuinely a stunner.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.235
Oh, not just for the franchise,

35:03.369 --> 35:05.537
but for any
Hollywood blockbuster.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.674
So, what are we watching?

35:18.350 --> 35:19.185
I'm sorry.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.388
I didn't think that, uh...

35:27.259 --> 35:28.227
Should I go?

35:30.061 --> 35:30.996
Yeah.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.595
I'm guessing it wasn't a date?

36:06.131 --> 36:07.733
If it would help,
I could tell you about

36:07.866 --> 36:10.402
what I thought
was a romantic trip
to Acapulco

36:10.536 --> 36:11.403
right after my accident.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.438
It wouldn't.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.613
It never even occurred to him
that I would think
it was a date.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.620
Don't do the surgery.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.457
Whatever Dr. Murphy
is proposing

36:31.590 --> 36:33.625
I'm sure sounds
pretty good right now.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.527
Do you even know
what he's proposing?

36:35.661 --> 36:38.297
This is about you wanting
your old life back at any cost.

36:40.466 --> 36:41.333
I've been where you are.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.637
The first year
after I lost my leg,

36:46.938 --> 36:48.707
I would have risked anything
to get it back.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.643
But I like my life now.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.446
I like who I am now.

36:57.283 --> 36:58.149
Give yourself time.

37:07.393 --> 37:10.362
Skyler? Can you hear us?

37:13.098 --> 37:13.965
Mommy?

37:15.367 --> 37:17.903
Oh, careful.
You've got a lot of stitches.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.039
What happened?

37:21.172 --> 37:23.174
You got really sick,
but these doctors fixed you up.

37:25.511 --> 37:28.079
This man gave you
part of his liver.

37:31.517 --> 37:32.684
He saved your life.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.020
Who are you?

37:39.891 --> 37:40.692
I'm Mick.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.508
See you on Monday.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.712
Five years sober, huh?

38:07.753 --> 38:09.120
Do you even have a brother?

38:11.357 --> 38:12.123
I do.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.726
But, um, he's not the addict.

38:17.363 --> 38:18.196
And...

38:19.765 --> 38:20.732
your addiction,

38:22.200 --> 38:25.103
is that the reason

38:26.405 --> 38:28.607
why you and I can't...

38:28.740 --> 38:29.508
Yeah.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.750
About six months ago,
I had a setback.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.752
Bought some heroin.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.589
Flushed it before I took it,
but still.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.826
My first priority is making it
to midnight without using.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.163
My second
is becoming a surgeon.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.934
And I don't know
how to add a third
without risking the others.

39:01.272 --> 39:03.008
Thank you for trusting me.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.115
I really hope
we can be friends.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.149
Yeah.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.619
We're friends.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.403
I have reserved
an OR for tomorrow
afternoon in case--

39:31.537 --> 39:33.171
I've decided
against the surgery.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.207
Thank you for your work.

39:39.445 --> 39:40.245
Why?

39:41.947 --> 39:43.314
She doesn't owe us
an explanation, Shaun.

39:43.449 --> 39:44.983
Yes, she does.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.385
I revised my plan,
like you told me.

39:47.519 --> 39:48.787
Shaun.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.656
I can look
for less invasive methods.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.625
Shaun, stop. Shaun, stop.
- I-It's not fair.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.226
- If your concern
is recovery time...
- You know what?

39:55.360 --> 39:58.063
- You don't have
to stay for this. I can show--
- Stop!

40:10.241 --> 40:12.343
It's not fair.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.315
Tell me the reasons
why you think it's not fair,

40:18.717 --> 40:19.718
and I'll try to explain it.

40:22.353 --> 40:22.921
I'm sorry.

40:40.005 --> 40:42.608
I heard Lim said no
to the surgery.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.643
You did the right thing trying.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.545
It accomplished nothing.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.886
When I went back to Hershey
to help my family's company,

40:56.021 --> 40:58.624
I thought
it would fix the business,

40:58.757 --> 41:01.693
fix things with my brother,
fix things with my parents.

41:02.761 --> 41:03.762
Failed on all three.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.297
But I'm glad I did it.

41:07.398 --> 41:08.900
That makes no sense.

41:10.602 --> 41:13.905
I'd rather do my best and fail
than always regret not trying.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.143
When people are in pain,
try to help them.

41:21.246 --> 41:25.083
Even if you think
it won't change anything?

41:27.252 --> 41:29.755
That only makes it braver.

41:47.973 --> 41:48.774
Thanks for coming.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.916
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.019
Dr. Park wants me to talk
to you about my life.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.955
I don't know if I can help.

42:07.593 --> 42:08.794
But I am going to try.

42:25.777 --> 42:26.845
Okay...
