00:52.320 --> 00:54.680
Need a hand?
- I'm fine.

00:58.800 --> 01:02.600
Nicely done. Thanks. I can start
my car all on my own, as well.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.360
Sorry, I didn't mean to...
I'm joking.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.480
How is it out there today?
Same as it always is. Perfect.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.960
Who needs church
when you've got this?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.560
Yeah.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.200
Well, enjoy.
Thanks.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.720
Hi, Laura.
- Hi, Danny.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.360
Hey.
- Hey. Er...

02:03.400 --> 02:06.280
Sorry,
I thought you were back later.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.039
Yeah, well,
the world's full of surprises.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.120
This is the last of it.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.000
I left you Monty.
I won him for you.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.840
Maybe I'll visit at weekends.
Don't think so.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.880
Has to be for good this time.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.320
Yeah.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.400
It's no-one's fault.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.280
Kinda makes it worse.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.360
I'd like us to stay friends.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.480
I know that sounds lame.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.360
But there aren't many people
I've known since I was 13.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.040
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.080
You don't fancy watching the game tonight, do you?
Got these lovely salmon cakes in.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.400
You don't need to stay in
every night, Dad.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.400
I don't stay in every night.
When did you last go out?

03:06.440 --> 03:11.280
Well, I mean... you know, I'm busy at work and
got you to look after... You need to go out.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.080
For both of our sakes. Trust me.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.480
I lost you at salmon cakes,
didn't I? Yep.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.920
Schoolboy error.
All right, have a good one.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.000
Oh, Luke. Luke. Luke!

03:29.760 --> 03:31.520
Luke!

03:35.560 --> 03:37.280
Oh, yeah.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.920
"Oh, thanks very much, Dad."
"You're welcome, son."

03:42.960 --> 03:46.400
Talking to yourself again.
First sign of madness.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.400
Shame you can't capture
these magical moment, hey?

03:49.440 --> 03:53.040
Gratitude. I mean...
It's heart-warming, isn't it?

03:53.080 --> 03:56.560
How are you?
Oh, I'm good, yeah. You?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.600
Yeah, I'm well.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.960
You sure?

04:03.280 --> 04:08.240
My bloody sister's been gossiping to everyone
at the hospital about me and Tom, hasn't she?

04:08.280 --> 04:10.480
Well, not everyone.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.680
Cleaner hasn't been told yet.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.000
Morning, Miss.
Morning.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.399
I'm fine, really.
Good.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.519
Cos I was wondering,

04:20.560 --> 04:22.920
and it's fine if you don't,
obviously,

04:22.960 --> 04:25.120
and it's too soon...

04:26.240 --> 04:30.360
Would you like to...
go for a drink some time?

04:32.480 --> 04:35.160
Oh, erm...
No rush.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.680
Maybe.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.760
Sure, yeah, some time.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.960
Of course. When you're ready.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.560
Have a good day. 
- Yeah, you, too.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.000
See ya.

04:52.080 --> 04:56.920
He's a bloody surgeon who drives a sports car.
If you don't lock that down, I will.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.520
He's got that single dad, brooding widower
thing going on. Doesn't that tick every box?

05:01.560 --> 05:05.000
Don't talk to me about boxes.
I saw enough of those this morning.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.720
Tom moved out the last of his stuff.
Good!

05:08.760 --> 05:12.720
It's been over for ages. You were
never a proper couple, not really.

05:12.760 --> 05:16.040
You were just old mates that got
drunk, had sex and shacked up

05:16.080 --> 05:20.280
because you were too polite to admit
it was a mistake. Don't hold back.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.360
You must understand, sir, that
a person is either with this court

05:24.400 --> 05:27.640
or he must be counted against it.
There be no road between.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.680
This is a sharp time now, a precise time.
We live no longer in the dusky afternoon

05:32.720 --> 05:37.960
when evil mixed itself with good and befuddled the
world. Now, by God's grace, the shining sun is up

05:38.000 --> 05:40.800
and them that fear not light
will surely praise it.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.000
Good. Thank you, Rebecca.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.440
So, this statement by Danforth

05:46.480 --> 05:50.600
really sums up the attitude of the
authorities toward the witch trials.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.080
Yes, Luke? Actually, I was just
pointing at the light bulb.

05:54.120 --> 05:59.000
Don't be stupid. If you're going to point
at a light bulb, you point at it like this.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.280
Right, OK, let's crack on.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.360
So, what modern parallels...

06:11.920 --> 06:16.240
Oh, hello.
I hear wedding bells!

06:16.280 --> 06:21.480
Oh, for God's sake. Am I 16 again?
I feel like I'm in Dawson's Creek.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.120
Oh, you wish.
- I actually do.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.280
"He's always liked you, you know?"

06:27.320 --> 06:29.920
Is it possible
to divorce your sister?

06:29.960 --> 06:31.960
Do you want to die alone?

06:32.000 --> 06:36.240
A single woman in this hospital would give
both arms and probably throw in a leg

06:36.280 --> 06:39.520
for a drink with that man.
I broke up with Tom this morning.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.680
No, you broke up with him weeks ago.
He left this morning.

06:43.720 --> 06:47.040
"Text Andrew. Do it. Just do it!"

06:49.120 --> 06:50.920
OK. OK.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.120
Forwarding his number.
Do it now or I'll hate you forever.

07:08.440 --> 07:13.400
Let it go. Let the weight
lift off your shoulders.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.720
Shut out all the noise, Andrew.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.840
Just repeat your mantra to yourself.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.280
Slowly repeat your mantra.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.600
I'm just gonna get that. Give it
a proper go. You said you'd try.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.080
I did. I sat down, didn't I?
I closed my eyes.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.520
If anyone could do with
a bit of meditation, it's you.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.400
Look, my wife swears by it.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.440
Yeah, give me an aortic dissection
any day.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.040
You might have a point.
Are you decent?

07:47.080 --> 07:50.200
Very rarely.
Patient's ready.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.640
I don't even wanna ask.

07:53.680 --> 07:58.440
Hey, Katy, don't suppose
you've got any advice? Your sister?

07:58.480 --> 08:03.400
I assume you know about this.
Be nice to her or I'll kill you.

08:14.880 --> 08:19.720
â™ª This ain't love, it's clear to see

08:19.760 --> 08:24.640
â™ª So, darling, stay with me

08:30.000 --> 08:32.919
"So, what's the plan?"
I said dinner.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.559
Do you think that's too much on a first date?
- "No, it's fine. It's a bit more grown up."

08:38.640 --> 08:41.600
Anyway, I think he'd like to make
a good impression.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.840
I think he's nervous.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.720
It's all right for some. I'd love to
be taken out for a romantic dinner.

08:47.760 --> 08:53.360
All I've got to look forward to tonight is bath
time and checking for monsters under the bed.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.320
"Enjoy yourself.
Let me know how it goes."

08:56.360 --> 08:58.160
Yep, I will.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.440
"OK. Bye!"
Bye!

09:01.480 --> 09:06.000
Yeah, I need a taxi, please.
Erm, now.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.200
OK, great. Yep, that's me. Thank you.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.560
How are you tonight, then, my love?

09:13.600 --> 09:15.920
Yeah, good, thanks.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.480
Bit nervous, actually.
I've got a date

09:20.520 --> 09:22.640
and I'm a bit out of practice.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.960
Like, really out of practice.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.840
You know, 30 years ago, I was parked
outside a hospital on a yellow line

09:31.880 --> 09:35.760
and this traffic warden's writing me
out a ticket so I go off at her.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.640
I'm effing and blinding.
And she stares at me

09:39.680 --> 09:42.440
like she's a world poker champion.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.640
Well, she just made my blood boil.
You know, those people?

09:45.680 --> 09:47.960
Yep, I know those people.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.120
30 years of marriage to that woman and
she still does it, that poker face.

09:53.160 --> 09:57.360
I married her four months after
she gave me that bloody ticket.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.440
So you never can tell, see,
what's around the corner. Hm!

10:02.480 --> 10:06.120
Here you go. Keep the change.
Oh, thank you.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.680
You have a good one, darling.
I will. Thanks.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.400
Nice to meet you.
You, too. Bye-bye.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.040
Sorry I'm late.
Don't be silly.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.840
I couldn't get a taxi. Thank you.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.800
Hi.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.800
Hi.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.960
Hello. Morning. Mind if I join?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.560
As long as this lot behind me
don't lynch you for queue-jumping.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.200
So how was it?
How was what?

12:09.240 --> 12:12.000
Don't play coy.
How was your big date?

12:12.040 --> 12:14.920
Look, it was good, mate.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.040
It was really good.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.560
Hey. Oh, you're soaking!

12:30.600 --> 12:33.080
Come in!
No, I don't wanna see the kids.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.920
What's the matter? What's going on?

12:35.960 --> 12:38.440
Sorry to just come round like this,
erm...

12:38.480 --> 12:41.480
Laura, what's happened?
Last night, erm...

12:41.520 --> 12:45.960
Andrew, he came to my place for a
drink after we'd been out and, erm...

12:47.320 --> 12:49.360
I don't, er...

12:49.400 --> 12:51.800
I don't remember. I don't...

12:51.840 --> 12:54.200
I don't know what he did, Katy.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.800
I don't know what he did.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.400
Is Auntie Laura OK?

13:06.440 --> 13:08.560
Yeah, she's fine.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.640
I don't remember most of it.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.080
It's just, erm...

13:13.120 --> 13:16.120
just flashes and moments
here and there.

13:17.800 --> 13:21.720
How much... did you have to drink?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.200
Er... I don't know.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.440
More than I should've done.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.640
I was nervous.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.680
That's not what this was, though.

13:37.720 --> 13:41.200
I remember... I remember kissing him.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.760
And then...

13:46.360 --> 13:49.000
And then we were on the bed
and I think...

13:49.040 --> 13:51.480
I think that's when
I told him to stop.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.520
You think? - I didn't want to
sleep with him, Katy.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.480
Did you push him? Did you try and fight him off?
- I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.240
And, er... how did the evening end?

14:04.280 --> 14:07.280
Always straight to the point.
Well, I'm just asking.

14:08.320 --> 14:13.280
I really like her, put it that way.
I mean, she's amazing.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.440
I know Andrew, I work with him.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.040
If he really knew
you didn't want to, I...

14:19.080 --> 14:23.520
I realise how this sounds, I do, but
I woke up this morning and I thought,

14:23.560 --> 14:28.960
I felt like it was happening to someone else,
that it couldn't be real, but it is. It was...

14:30.360 --> 14:32.400
It was real, I know it was.

14:31.193 --> 14:35.033
So, are you gonna see her again?
- Yeah, I hope so.

14:35.073 --> 14:37.193
I sent her a text.
- Already?

14:37.233 --> 14:40.513
No, you don't wanna be too clingy.
- Yeah, she hasn't replied.

14:40.553 --> 14:45.073
Well, I'm not surprised. The minute
you send those damn things,

14:45.113 --> 14:50.753
time grinds to a halt wondering why they haven't
texted back. It's like being a teenager again.

14:54.153 --> 14:55.833
Thanks for dinner.

14:59.073 --> 15:01.553
Oh, to be young again.

15:01.593 --> 15:03.433
No thanks.

15:03.473 --> 15:08.473
I'm sure you were too well behaved for that
sort of thing. What does Luke call it? PDA?

15:08.513 --> 15:11.593
Er, do you know,
I didn't get much opportunity.

15:12.633 --> 15:14.393
No?

15:14.433 --> 15:17.993
I was more interested in chocolate
than boys when I was younger.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.873
It's still a close run thing.

15:19.913 --> 15:23.313
What about you?
What about me?

15:23.353 --> 15:25.993
What were you like
when you were at school?

15:26.033 --> 15:28.353
Ah, pretty much perfect
in every way.

15:28.393 --> 15:31.113
Ah. So you became
an arrogant sod later.

15:31.153 --> 15:34.433
Yes, that came later.

15:37.993 --> 15:41.753
Hello. Hi. Is it Laura?
And you're Katy. Come in.

15:41.793 --> 15:45.713
So if we go down here,
we've got a room on the right.

15:45.753 --> 15:47.953
It's a bit warmer.

15:51.753 --> 15:56.673
Now, here's Julia.
She's our forensic examiner today.

15:56.713 --> 16:01.033
Erm, so this is Laura
and this is Laura's sister.

16:01.073 --> 16:03.233
OK. Thank you very much.

16:03.273 --> 16:07.593
I'm gonna prepare the room now for examination.
I'll let you know when I'm ready.

16:12.033 --> 16:15.353
OK. I'll be with you in a moment,
all right?

16:19.073 --> 16:23.633
So, we would like to collect
your underwear,

16:23.673 --> 16:28.113
your trousers and your top stuff,
but not your coat or your shoes.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.153
And we'll provide you
with replacements.

16:31.193 --> 16:34.593
If you could drop those clothes
onto that for me.

16:35.593 --> 16:38.313
We're just behind the curtains,
all right?

16:59.153 --> 17:02.513
OK.
OK? OK.

17:03.513 --> 17:06.032
So Julia's gonna pick up
all of those clothes.

17:06.073 --> 17:08.433
Take a little seat on there for me,
please.

17:19.673 --> 17:22.473
Now, after the examination
and the drug test,

17:22.512 --> 17:24.752
we can call the police,

17:24.792 --> 17:27.193
we can do the report right here.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.793
Yeah, that would be good, thanks.
OK.

17:36.673 --> 17:40.393
OK, so I'm just gonna
slip your arm out here.

17:40.433 --> 17:45.873
OK, if you just hold it underneath, then
you can still cover yourself up a bit.

17:48.633 --> 17:50.193
OK.

17:57.073 --> 17:58.473
OK.

18:01.073 --> 18:02.993
This is me.

18:04.993 --> 18:07.833
Thanks for walking me home.

18:07.873 --> 18:10.193
I had a really good night.
Me, too.

18:15.273 --> 18:18.713
Good night. I really hope
we can do this again some time.

18:18.753 --> 18:22.633
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Yeah, me, too.

18:23.673 --> 18:25.553
Good night.
Night.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.673
Oh, bollocks.

18:29.713 --> 18:34.313
I was gonna call a cab
but my battery's died. Oh, smooth.

18:35.593 --> 18:38.273
Oh, no, it's not a line, I swear.

18:38.313 --> 18:41.673
It just knows when I need it the most.
I can call you one from inside.

18:41.713 --> 18:45.753
No, it's fine, I'll walk, honestly. Don't be silly!
It's freezing. Come on.

18:45.793 --> 18:47.473
Appreciate it.

18:51.193 --> 18:52.993
It's just upstairs.

18:59.553 --> 19:03.193
- All right.
- Thanks. Thanks.

19:05.913 --> 19:10.473
I'll tell the police what happened and then
I don't wanna talk about it any more, OK?

19:16.793 --> 19:18.793
You should go back to work.

19:18.833 --> 19:21.793
No, I'm... I've already told them
I'm not coming in.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.073
I was...

19:24.113 --> 19:28.993
I was supposed to be
in theatre today... with him.

19:32.993 --> 19:35.593
Take a nice soft seat.
Thank you.

19:35.633 --> 19:39.913
OK? And I'll go and get the police
officers now. Are you ready? Yeah.

19:39.953 --> 19:42.793
If you just come down.
She's just having a cup of tea.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.473
Is she by herself? Anyone with her?
Her sister. OK.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.833
All right, love.

19:52.913 --> 19:55.593
So these are the police officers
today

19:55.633 --> 19:59.993
and they will tell you who they are and
what the plan is for today, all right?

20:00.033 --> 20:04.473
Thank you. Hi, Miss Neilson.
I'm Detective Vanessa Harmon.

20:04.513 --> 20:06.953
This is my colleague, Rory Maxwell.
Hello.

20:06.993 --> 20:10.233
So, we've come to talk to you
about what's happened to you.

20:17.113 --> 20:21.033
BP's 90 over 55. Pulse is steady.

20:21.073 --> 20:24.153
OK. Let's close him up.

20:27.753 --> 20:30.873
Thanks for stepping in today.
Anyone heard from Katy yet?

20:30.913 --> 20:32.953
No, nothing.

20:36.793 --> 20:39.353
Mr Earlham,
the police are here to see you.

20:43.913 --> 20:46.473
I think we're all done here.
Do you mind closing up?

20:50.553 --> 20:53.353
Hello.
Mr Earlham.

20:53.393 --> 20:56.553
DI Harmon.
And I'm DS Maxwell.

20:56.593 --> 20:59.793
I've got another procedure
in 15 minutes. What's this about?

20:59.833 --> 21:03.753
We're from the sexual offences investigation team.
I'm arresting you for rape.

21:03.793 --> 21:08.913
You do not have to say anything but it may harm
your defence if you do not mention when questioned

21:08.953 --> 21:14.393
something you later rely on in court. Anything you
say may be given in evidence. Do you understand?

21:14.433 --> 21:18.153
Rape? Arrest?
What are you talking about?

21:18.193 --> 21:20.273
If you'd like to come with us, sir.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.953
I think there's been a mistake.

21:22.993 --> 21:27.913
Can I come and see you... We can cuff you if you
want or you can come along nicely. Up to you.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.193
Erm...

21:31.553 --> 21:36.153
Can I get changed at least?
Of course. We'll wait.

21:43.713 --> 21:45.393
I hate hospitals.

22:04.393 --> 22:08.153
Times like this...
I wish Mum was still here.

22:09.193 --> 22:11.313
She'd know what to say.

22:12.913 --> 22:15.033
There's nothing to say.

22:16.393 --> 22:19.953
Come on. Let's get you inside.

22:21.513 --> 22:24.873
Got some nice pictures there,
haven't you?

22:24.913 --> 22:28.753
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, look, Mummy's back.
Can you say hello?

22:28.793 --> 22:32.953
Hello, Mummy! Hello.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

22:32.993 --> 22:35.673
Hiya. Good?
Yeah, yeah.

22:35.713 --> 22:38.633
Shouldn't you two be at work?
I'm not feeling well.

22:38.673 --> 22:42.193
I said she's better off staying here
where we can look after her.

22:42.233 --> 22:44.793
Go upstairs
and I'll bring you some water, OK?

22:44.833 --> 22:47.353
Show Mummy what you've just drawn.

22:47.393 --> 22:50.233
Hey! Yeah, lovely!
â™ª Once I was 20 years old...

22:50.273 --> 22:54.433
Ah, phone! Oh, Jesus. When are you
gonna change that ringtone?

22:54.473 --> 22:57.273
As soon as that song
stops being so awesome.

22:57.313 --> 22:59.673
â™ª 20 years old

23:01.313 --> 23:03.433
I love this song.

23:03.473 --> 23:06.593
You and my brother-in-law
would get on well, then.

23:06.633 --> 23:09.233
I don't know what's taking them
so long.

23:10.233 --> 23:12.753
This is bloody stupid. Hi.

23:12.793 --> 23:16.393
Hi. Yeah. Erm,
I'd like a taxi, please.

23:16.433 --> 23:18.713
40 minutes?

23:20.753 --> 23:24.593
Er, yeah, that's fine. OK.

23:25.833 --> 23:28.593
Yep, that's me. Great. Thanks. Bye.

23:29.673 --> 23:32.993
Well, we might as well
get a drink, then.

23:33.033 --> 23:35.753
If you're sure.
It is a school night.

23:36.993 --> 23:41.153
It's quite literally a school night for
you, isn't it? I won't tell if you won't.

23:41.193 --> 23:44.233
Wine's in the kitchen.
Well, then, allow me.

23:52.753 --> 23:56.313
Oh, can I open this?
I don't know, can you?

23:56.353 --> 24:02.033
Ha-ha-ha. I'll bring it right over. I
could get used to this, waiter service.

24:03.393 --> 24:08.033
Well, this is taking far too long. It's
unacceptable. I couldn't find the glasses.

24:09.553 --> 24:11.393
Sorry.

24:11.433 --> 24:12.993
Sorry.

24:14.193 --> 24:16.473
I just wanted to get your key.

24:16.513 --> 24:19.913
I was gonna go round and get you
a bag of clothes and stuff.

24:19.953 --> 24:22.113
Yeah, OK.

24:26.713 --> 24:29.593
You can stay with us
for as long as you want.

24:29.633 --> 24:31.313
Thank you.

24:32.433 --> 24:35.593
Will you be OK?
I'm fine.

24:35.633 --> 24:39.193
Well, Liam is downstairs
and I'll be as quick as I can.

24:40.233 --> 24:41.833
OK.

24:55.393 --> 24:58.153
Will you stop calling me?
I'm in the middle of...

24:59.553 --> 25:02.033
No, I'm just saying
it's not a good time.

25:04.393 --> 25:08.513
I don't know when, OK?
Just... leave me alone.

25:21.633 --> 25:24.513
Excuse me, I'm afraid
you can't be in here right now.

25:24.553 --> 25:28.753
Er, this is my sister's flat. I'm just
here to collect some clothes for her.

25:28.793 --> 25:33.793
Sorry, you have to wait until we're completely
finished. If you can wait outside. OK. Thank you.

25:39.873 --> 25:43.153
The taxi was taking
even longer than we thought

25:43.193 --> 25:45.833
so I asked
if I could charge my mobile.

25:45.873 --> 25:47.833
She said OK.

25:47.873 --> 25:51.593
And did Miss Neilson take the phone
from you at that point? No.

25:51.633 --> 25:55.913
No, she said the charger was
in the bedroom. So I followed her.

25:56.953 --> 26:02.113
And when I was in there... we started kissing.
Did you kiss her first?

26:03.193 --> 26:05.353
Er... Erm...

26:05.393 --> 26:07.473
Yeah, I think so.

26:07.513 --> 26:09.633
Yes, yes, I did.

26:09.673 --> 26:13.593
Erm, and then she... kissed me back.

26:14.593 --> 26:17.753
And then...
Mm-hm?

26:19.593 --> 26:22.833
Christ.
What else do you want me to say?

26:22.873 --> 26:25.633
Well, what happened
after you started kissing?

26:25.673 --> 26:29.473
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna talk about that.

26:29.513 --> 26:32.753
She said you raped her.
No! No, I didn't!

26:32.793 --> 26:35.393
We laid down on the bed, OK?

26:37.033 --> 26:39.233
Do you really need me
to spell it out?

26:39.273 --> 26:41.953
Were you on top of her
as you laid down? Yes.

26:41.993 --> 26:44.553
Did you push her down?
No! God, no!

26:44.593 --> 26:47.273
She had her arm around me.
Did she ask you to stop?

26:47.313 --> 26:48.913
No, never!

26:51.233 --> 26:55.833
Look... I took off her clothes...

26:56.833 --> 26:59.513
...and she helped me take off mine.

26:59.553 --> 27:03.353
We never said anything. We were
just in the moment, you know?

27:03.393 --> 27:05.233
And then, er...

27:07.593 --> 27:10.113
Then I didn't have a...

27:10.153 --> 27:13.033
A condom.
Yes. Christ.

27:16.153 --> 27:21.313
And she said that I could use one
from her bathroom,

27:21.353 --> 27:23.673
so I got up

27:23.713 --> 27:26.073
and went over to the cabinet
to get one.

27:26.113 --> 27:28.273
And all that time, she didn't...

27:29.713 --> 27:32.233
...she didn't get up or walk away

27:32.273 --> 27:36.433
or say, "Stop, I don't want this."
Not once.

27:37.753 --> 27:40.433
You have to believe me.
If I thought for one second

27:40.473 --> 27:43.513
she didn't wanna sleep with me,
I would never have done it.

27:43.553 --> 27:46.313
I don't know why she'd say
something like this.

27:46.353 --> 27:49.513
All I know is
I had a wonderful night

27:49.553 --> 27:53.753
with a woman I thought I'd be seeing again.
I sent her a text, for God's sake.

27:53.793 --> 27:57.193
We've pulled the details from
your phone. Well, there you are.

27:57.233 --> 27:59.713
Then you've read it.
"What an amazing night."

27:59.753 --> 28:03.113
Why on earth would I send
a text like that if I'd...

28:05.033 --> 28:07.353
If I did what you're saying...

28:08.593 --> 28:10.713
...why would I do that?

28:21.667 --> 28:24.307
Andrew, you're being released
on police bail.

28:25.587 --> 28:27.587
Sorry this took so long.

28:28.587 --> 28:30.187
Sign there.

28:34.267 --> 28:36.427
So, here's my card.

28:36.467 --> 28:42.267
Call me if you need anything. In the meantime, get
some sleep and... we'll speak in the morning. OK.

28:42.307 --> 28:44.467
I'll show you out.

28:46.347 --> 28:48.547
Oh. Sorry. Excuse me.

28:52.027 --> 28:55.747
Sit down.
Keys, keys, keys.

28:55.787 --> 28:58.067
Erm... by the bowl.
Oh.

28:58.107 --> 29:00.307
Next to the fridge.
Hey! Give me that!

29:00.347 --> 29:03.907
Er, no! OK, so, Riddle's off sick
so I'm gonna be late tonight.

29:03.947 --> 29:05.987
Again?
Yeah, sorry.

29:06.027 --> 29:09.267
I'd trade you if I could.
Really? Cos you can be my guest.

29:09.307 --> 29:13.627
No, you have to eat your fruit! Come on!
Olly, Max, listen to Daddy, please.

29:13.667 --> 29:16.107
You gonna tell me
what's going on with Laura?

29:16.147 --> 29:20.627
I told you. You said the break-up. I'm not
buying it. Her and Tom have been over for ages.

29:20.667 --> 29:24.747
OK. OK. Something happened.
But don't say anything.

29:48.547 --> 29:51.187
Dad?
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

30:03.587 --> 30:07.027
She went out with Andrew Earlham,
he's a surgeon at my hospital.

30:07.067 --> 30:09.027
Right.

30:09.067 --> 30:10.947
She says he raped her.

30:12.987 --> 30:15.987
I know. It's... It's awful.

30:16.027 --> 30:18.947
Do the police know...
what happened last time?

30:20.787 --> 30:22.587
Why should they?

30:24.307 --> 30:29.907
Right, who wants toast faces? Me!
Yay! Hands up. Hands up. Morning.

30:29.947 --> 30:31.907
Right, I'm off.

30:31.947 --> 30:35.387
Want me to fix you breakfast?
I'm OK, thanks. You're going to work?

30:37.507 --> 30:41.707
This is a bad idea. I'm not gonna
let this control me, Katy.

30:43.627 --> 30:47.107
Sorry. Sorry.
Late getting started this morning.

30:47.147 --> 30:49.267
What time did you get back
last night?

30:49.307 --> 30:53.507
I... had a surgery that went on.
Ah, figured.

30:54.507 --> 30:56.587
Sorry. I should've called.

30:56.627 --> 30:59.267
It's fine.
No. No. It's not fine.

30:59.307 --> 31:01.947
I should've called you.
You were here on your own.

31:01.987 --> 31:05.507
Dad, are you OK?
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

31:05.547 --> 31:10.067
Just, erm... just...
just a late night, that's all.

31:14.027 --> 31:16.347
Actually, Luke...
Dad, it's ten to!

31:17.467 --> 31:20.107
Whoa! Are you sure
you can drive without coffee?

31:20.147 --> 31:23.947
Ha-ha-ha. I'm not that bad. Just don't
fall asleep at the wheel, yeah?

31:27.547 --> 31:29.507
Here she is.

31:29.547 --> 31:32.187
What happened to you yesterday?
I tried calling.

31:32.227 --> 31:34.507
I wasn't feeling well.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.907
So, I'm dying to know,
how was the date?

31:41.147 --> 31:43.907
You know, I'd rather not
talk about it, if that's OK.

31:44.907 --> 31:47.747
Sure. Are you all right?

31:49.107 --> 31:50.867
I'm fine.

31:51.867 --> 31:53.467
I will be.

32:00.427 --> 32:03.747
Luke! Get down off there right now!

32:03.787 --> 32:08.507
'Tis the Iron Throne. Westeros will fall if
I denounce the throne, miss. Get down now!

32:09.827 --> 32:14.307
I was just... Just what? I've had enough!
That's school property! Go and see the head!

32:14.347 --> 32:17.867
Seriously?
Go! Now!

32:21.107 --> 32:24.827
If you put the same effort into school
work as you do into pissing about,

32:24.867 --> 32:27.187
you might stand a chance of passing!

32:27.227 --> 32:31.307
What are you looking at? Put this room
back together now! Get your books out!

32:34.347 --> 32:38.347
I do have a photograph. Yes! Come on.
Come on. Out with it. Out with it.

32:38.387 --> 32:40.227
She's gonna kill me if I...
Come on!

32:42.947 --> 32:44.227
Got it.

32:45.987 --> 32:51.387
Right, so, this is me and Katy
when I was 11 and she was 13.

32:53.387 --> 32:56.387
She had an overbite
of about three metres.

32:56.427 --> 32:58.587
What did she do?

32:58.627 --> 33:02.307
I think our parents made her
orthodontist a very rich man that year.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.387
It's nice that you two are so close.

33:04.427 --> 33:07.707
I mean, she talks about you
all the time. Non-stop.

33:07.747 --> 33:12.107
She talks about everyone non-stop. No, no, no.
But you in particular. In a nice way.

33:12.147 --> 33:14.587
I feel like I know
everything about you.

33:18.267 --> 33:21.347
Well... that's not fair.

33:21.387 --> 33:24.827
I, erm...
I hardly know anything about you.

33:24.867 --> 33:27.947
Apart from the fact
you give a good parents' evening.

33:27.987 --> 33:30.747
Do I?
Yeah. Trust me.

33:49.787 --> 33:53.467
What are you doing here? You're not
allowed to be anywhere near me.

33:53.507 --> 33:58.067
I just wanna talk. Luke told me
you sent him to the headmaster.

33:58.107 --> 34:01.227
Get out!
I know he's a handful, I do,

34:01.267 --> 34:04.467
but... please don't take
whatever this is out on him.

34:04.507 --> 34:07.867
Whatever this is?

34:07.907 --> 34:11.746
You really think I forced you?
I know what happened!

34:11.786 --> 34:13.746
Yeah, me, too!

34:15.347 --> 34:21.266
Look, Laura, I'm sorry if things
moved faster than you intended.

34:22.587 --> 34:26.027
If I'd known you wanted me
to stop... I said no!

34:26.067 --> 34:28.187
No, you didn't.

34:29.867 --> 34:34.587
You might have meant to, Laura, but
you didn't. You never did. I did.

34:36.266 --> 34:40.587
Look, we're just seeing this
completely differently, that's all.

34:42.427 --> 34:46.786
It's just an awful misunderstanding. - Get out.
- That's not the right word. - Get out.

34:46.827 --> 34:50.427
Look, Laura, please. - Get out.
- They arrested me... - Get out!

34:50.467 --> 34:53.706
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

34:53.746 --> 34:57.307
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.

34:57.347 --> 34:59.707
This was a bad idea. I'm sorry.

35:03.187 --> 35:06.027
"Tom, it's me."
You all right?

35:06.067 --> 35:08.827
"Erm... Sorry.

35:08.867 --> 35:12.747
Sorry to call. I need to... see you.
I need to talk to you."

35:12.787 --> 35:17.707
Yeah, sure. "Thank you. Thanks.
OK. I'll see you later."

35:22.107 --> 35:25.867
Sorry. I wasn't gonna call you.
I'm glad you did.

35:26.947 --> 35:29.227
Don't look at me like that.

35:29.267 --> 35:32.587
Like what?
Like I'm a victim.

35:32.627 --> 35:37.587
Look, I didn't call you for sympathy. I just
wanted to hear it straight from someone who knows.

35:38.587 --> 35:42.107
Do you think the police will
do something? Of course they will.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.827
He was convincing today.

35:48.707 --> 35:51.907
He looked me straight in the eye,
with no-one else around,

35:51.947 --> 35:54.707
and he swore blind
that I had it all wrong.

35:55.747 --> 35:57.867
He practically had me believing it.

35:59.627 --> 36:01.667
The law is on your side.

36:01.707 --> 36:04.067
Even though I can't prove it?

36:04.107 --> 36:06.227
It's my word against his.

36:06.267 --> 36:08.427
I invited him in.
That doesn't matter.

36:09.547 --> 36:11.587
How do I know they'll believe me?

36:12.667 --> 36:18.267
If they find out about my background, that I was
on medication... Don't. Don't think like that.

36:18.307 --> 36:20.067
It's gonna be OK.

36:21.067 --> 36:23.547
Thanks. I'm sorry for bothering you.

36:24.907 --> 36:27.587
Let me give you a lift home.
No, I'm fine.

36:27.627 --> 36:29.747
Laura, please, come on.
I said I'm fine!

37:10.267 --> 37:12.387
I didn't think you were coming.

37:13.427 --> 37:15.427
I wasn't going to.

37:16.707 --> 37:18.947
What happened to Laura, it's awful.

37:18.987 --> 37:23.147
And I know you need to be there
for her. I understand that.

37:23.187 --> 37:25.467
I can wait. As long as you need.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.587
But I'm not ready to just
let what we have go away.

37:31.267 --> 37:34.227
I love you, Katy.
Stop it!

37:34.267 --> 37:36.787
We were a stupid mistake.
That's all.

37:37.907 --> 37:42.507
If Laura ever found out,
Christ, Tom, if she knew about us...

37:42.547 --> 37:46.387
You're not the reason Laura and I broke up.
I'm supposed to be helping her!

37:47.387 --> 37:52.987
She's my little sister and right now
she needs me and I can't do anything.

37:54.187 --> 37:56.267
You're doing what you can.

37:57.307 --> 37:59.507
You remember what happened,
don't you?

37:59.547 --> 38:02.507
Are you sure it happened
exactly like she said it did?

38:03.507 --> 38:05.987
Why would she lie
about something like this?

38:07.747 --> 38:11.027
Andrew needs to go away
for what he's done to her.

38:12.027 --> 38:14.467
You need to look
into Andrew Earlham.

38:14.507 --> 38:17.027
Find out everything you can
about him.

38:17.067 --> 38:21.427
There are detectives on it, people who do
this day in, day out. It's not my job.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.507
Please!

38:25.507 --> 38:28.427
All right, I'll...
I'll do whatever I can. I promise.

38:30.667 --> 38:32.467
Listen to me.

38:33.467 --> 38:35.907
I don't care
how long I have to wait.

38:40.427 --> 38:42.507
We're a mistake, Tom!

38:43.667 --> 38:45.827
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

39:00.627 --> 39:02.987
Sorry to disturb you, Miss Neilson.

39:03.027 --> 39:06.387
Your sister said you were staying
here when we interviewed her.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.227
Why don't we take a seat
and we can talk?

39:10.667 --> 39:12.707
So, how are you doing?

39:13.707 --> 39:15.747
Have you arrested him?

39:18.587 --> 39:21.107
He's been released on police bail.

39:21.147 --> 39:25.107
Mr Earlham
has a different version of events.

39:25.147 --> 39:28.227
I'm sure he does.
He said it was consensual.

39:31.067 --> 39:32.947
I said no.

39:33.947 --> 39:35.907
I asked him to stop.

39:35.947 --> 39:40.067
Miss Neilson, all we're trying to do
here is make sure we have all the facts.

39:41.507 --> 39:43.747
We didn't find any...

39:43.787 --> 39:47.747
cuts or bruises on Mr Earlham.
Or you.

39:47.787 --> 39:50.307
The drug test was negative.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.907
There was no genital injury.
There was no...

39:52.947 --> 39:56.547
So how badly exactly does he have
to hurt me before you call it rape?

39:56.587 --> 40:00.387
People in the bar where you met
said you were getting on well.

40:00.427 --> 40:03.707
CCTV shows you
walking home laughing.

40:03.747 --> 40:05.667
That was before.

40:04.466 --> 40:08.706
Mr Earlham says when he went to get a
condom that you didn't move from the bed.

40:10.306 --> 40:12.546
Did you try to get away
at that point?

40:18.026 --> 40:19.946
I don't remember.

40:23.066 --> 40:26.066
I was in shock. I couldn't move.
Erm...

40:30.106 --> 40:32.186
I'm not making this up.
- No, no, no.

40:32.226 --> 40:37.106
Nobody's saying you are. We're just... We're
asking these questions because we have to.

40:37.146 --> 40:39.666
Mm-hm. - Because it's what
his lawyer will ask.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.426
It all happened in a blur. He was...

40:47.346 --> 40:50.066
He was on top of me and...

40:50.106 --> 40:53.146
and I wanted to push him off,
but I was so...

40:54.506 --> 40:56.946
...I was so shocked, I couldn't...

40:56.986 --> 40:58.986
I couldn't move.

41:03.546 --> 41:06.506
Maybe he went into the bathroom.
I don't know.

41:06.546 --> 41:08.666
I can't... I can't remember.

41:08.706 --> 41:10.866
How much don't you remember?

41:12.106 --> 41:13.626
How much...

41:14.946 --> 41:17.386
...exactly did you have to drink?

41:20.986 --> 41:26.026
No, no, no, no. That's not what I'm saying.
You're making it out... I don't mean... No. I...

41:27.386 --> 41:31.586
I wasn't drunk.
I remember coming into the bedroom.

41:31.626 --> 41:33.666
I remember him pushing me down.

41:33.706 --> 41:36.826
And I remember,
I remember clear as anything,

41:36.866 --> 41:38.946
I told him to stop.

41:42.746 --> 41:44.626
Yeah.

41:46.866 --> 41:50.986
You know, I don't think I wanna talk
about this any more today, actually.

41:51.026 --> 41:54.266
All right,
let's just leave it there for now.

41:54.306 --> 41:57.546
I'm afraid we will have to go
through this in a bit more detail.

41:57.586 --> 41:59.706
I'll give you a call
and figure out a time.

41:59.746 --> 42:03.186
Sorry to have disturbed you.
We'll show ourselves out. Thank you.

42:34.826 --> 42:37.786
Hi, is that Edinburgh
Coroner's Office?

42:37.826 --> 42:41.626
My name's Tom Bailey. I'm a constable
with the Thanet and Dover Police.

42:44.266 --> 42:47.066
I'm just trying to find out
about an old case.

42:47.106 --> 42:50.026
Mary Earlham.
Wife of Andrew Earlham.

42:50.066 --> 42:53.346
A suicide back in 2006.

43:26.106 --> 43:29.386
He swapped the glasses.
- How do you know?

43:29.426 --> 43:32.426
Because I remember now. We came in,

43:32.466 --> 43:36.546
he poured the wine while I sat down,
then I got up and I grabbed a glass.

43:36.586 --> 43:40.586
We talked. Then I went into
the other room to get a photograph.

43:40.626 --> 43:44.226
But it was his idea. He told me to go
and get it. And when I came back,

43:44.266 --> 43:47.346
he was drinking from my glass.
I left a lipstick stain.

43:48.346 --> 43:51.666
Maybe it was an accident. Mine was
at the other side of the table.

43:51.706 --> 43:54.506
This morning,
both glasses were in the dishwasher.

43:54.546 --> 43:59.426
Nothing else inside. And I didn't put them there.
Jesus, Laura! Are you saying he drugged you?

43:59.466 --> 44:01.866
Why else would he
have swapped the glasses?

44:01.906 --> 44:05.786
That's why I couldn't try any harder
to fight him off.

44:05.826 --> 44:11.066
That's why I just lay there while he went to the
bathroom. That's why the whole night felt like a blur.

44:11.106 --> 44:14.266
The blood tests didn't show
anything. I looked it up

44:14.306 --> 44:19.666
and GHB in the right quantities... Is gone
from the bloodstream in 12 hours. So...

44:19.706 --> 44:23.706
He's a doctor. He knew exactly what
he was doing, how much to give me.

44:24.906 --> 44:27.026
Not that it makes any difference.

44:29.786 --> 44:32.866
They'll look at my medical history,
Katy, and...

44:34.386 --> 44:36.906
...they'll call me a mad woman.

44:36.946 --> 44:41.186
A hysterical, mad woman
telling lies about the hero surgeon.

44:41.226 --> 44:43.186
You don't know that.

44:43.226 --> 44:46.466
All people will see
is that I invited him in,

44:46.506 --> 44:50.386
I poured him a drink,
and somehow that means I wanted it.

44:50.426 --> 44:53.066
You can't let yourself
think that way.

44:53.106 --> 44:55.146
Doesn't matter anyway.

44:56.306 --> 45:00.826
I'm gonna make sure that everyone knows
exactly who he is. What does that mean?

45:01.866 --> 45:04.426
Laura. Laura!

45:19.426 --> 45:23.586
Laura, whatever you're planning,
I'm asking you, don't do it.

45:23.626 --> 45:26.546
Don't do anything
to jeopardise the case. Too late.

45:26.586 --> 45:28.626
It's already done.

45:33.066 --> 45:35.706
I posted it on his profile page.

45:36.746 --> 45:40.906
Now every colleague, every friend,

45:40.946 --> 45:44.066
every member of his family...
Morning... now they know.

45:44.106 --> 45:46.306
Now they know.
