WEBVTT

00:00.876 --> 00:02.961
"Hey, Miles,
how's your day going?"

00:02.961 --> 00:05.130
"Oh, not bad.
Just your typical Tuesday.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.674
"Modifying Doc Ock's
old mechanical arms

00:07.674 --> 00:12.054
to help my friend, Peter Parker,
whose mind is trapped
inside said arms."

00:13.055 --> 00:15.182
I live a really weird life.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.016
[beeps]

00:21.021 --> 00:23.148
Oh, right. Speakers.

00:23.148 --> 00:26.276
<i>Miles! You're a genius!</i>
<i>[feedback]</i>

00:26.276 --> 00:30.155
[groans]
Okay. I think that's
all the bugs.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.617
<i>Not all the bugs.</i>
<i>We still got a spider to catch.</i>

00:33.617 --> 00:36.578
You, my friend, have a lot
of explaining to do.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.206
<i>You might wanna</i>
<i>sit down for this.</i>
<i>Seriously.</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:42.793
I'm about to find out
how your mind ended up
inside Doc Ock's arms.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.545
I'm a little too excited
to sit.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.130
<i>Doc Ock transferred</i>
<i>my consciousness</i>
<i>out of my body</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:50.092
<i>and didn't realize it would</i>
<i>end up in the hard drive</i>
<i>of the Neuro‐Cortex,</i>

00:50.092 --> 00:52.386
<i>which led me</i>
<i>to Horizon's mainframe,</i>
<i>which led me here.</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:57.307
So, if your mind
is in the arms,

00:57.307 --> 00:59.226
then whose mind
is in your body?

00:59.226 --> 01:01.603
<i>Hmm...</i>
[groans]

01:01.603 --> 01:03.647
<i>Told you</i>
<i>you should sit down.</i>

01:03.647 --> 01:06.275
Ock's mind in your body
explains everything.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.944
<i>What do you mean?</i>
Well, you‐‐

01:08.944 --> 01:10.946
I mean, Ock, as you,

01:10.946 --> 01:13.115
hasn't exactly been
the charming Peter Parker,

01:13.115 --> 01:16.034
or Spider‐Man,
the world is used to.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.873
I will crush you
into oblivion, villains!
[grunts]

01:21.873 --> 01:24.293
Please, Spider‐Man,
we don't want to fight you.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.920
[both grunting]

01:26.920 --> 01:31.008
You should have thought
about that before stealing
electromagnetic technology, foe!

01:31.008 --> 01:33.093
Sorry to have to do this.
[grunts]

01:33.093 --> 01:34.845
[grunts]

01:34.845 --> 01:36.388
[yells]

01:36.388 --> 01:39.182
Whoever you two are,
you are certainly not prepared

01:39.182 --> 01:41.893
to battle the likes of me.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.229
Let's go!

01:45.314 --> 01:47.691
What? Teleportation?
[yelling]

01:47.691 --> 01:50.068
[train horn blaring]
[grunts]

01:50.068 --> 01:53.488
It appears I have made
some miscalculations!

02:04.583 --> 02:06.126
[horn blaring]

02:06.126 --> 02:08.003
[grunts]

02:08.003 --> 02:10.297
[yells]
[grunts]

02:10.297 --> 02:14.134
<i>Hmm? The teleportation‐‐</i>
<i>it's draining his energy.</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:17.387
This‐‐ This is as far
as I could get.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.307
Spider‐Man's trapped,
which should
give us enough time

02:20.307 --> 02:23.226
for a recharge.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.227
Better?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.482
That's probably not good.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.859
Understatement of the night.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.862
Stay away from us, Spider‐Man!
[grunts]

02:35.113 --> 02:37.115
Well, that was embarrassing,

02:37.115 --> 02:39.660
losing to rank amateurs.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.703
At least I managed
to obtain footage.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.165
Perhaps I can find
their weaknesses.

02:45.165 --> 02:49.127
Hmm? Subjects:
Cloak and Dagger.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.630
Dangerous.
Potentially lethal.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.882
However, they appear new.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.218
Perhaps recently
obtained abilities?

02:56.218 --> 02:59.096
Dagger's energy
utilizes light waves,

02:59.096 --> 03:01.765
and Cloak appears to use
negative void space

03:01.765 --> 03:03.475
for teleportation.

03:03.475 --> 03:07.437
Hm. That is a power set
I have no contingency for.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.232
I will have to
devise something.

03:10.232 --> 03:13.276
I wonder if
a chemical light reaction
would neutralize him.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.612
Pete?
Why are you still home?

03:15.612 --> 03:18.323
Because... I live here?

03:18.323 --> 03:21.743
Funny.
School is about to start.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.122
I told you,
I am through with Horizon,

03:25.122 --> 03:28.750
an institution squeezing
its students for money
is no school worthy of‐‐

03:28.750 --> 03:32.129
I know. You told me
all your reasons for
not wanting to go there anymore,

03:32.129 --> 03:34.548
but you can't
just skip school.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.509
I enrolled you back
in public school yesterday.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.178
Wait.
You cannot be serious.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.972
Are you talking about...

03:41.972 --> 03:43.390
[bell ringing]

03:43.390 --> 03:45.767
<i>[thinking]</i>
<i>Midtown High.</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:50.814
<i>How does anyone expect to learn</i>
<i>surrounded by such</i>
<i>rampant buffoonery?</i>

03:50.814 --> 03:55.026
<i>Then again,</i>
<i>perhaps I'm viewing this</i>
<i>from the wrong perspective.</i>

03:55.026 --> 04:00.198
<i>The one thing I regret</i>
<i>in all of this</i>
<i>is that Parker has no PhD.</i>

04:00.198 --> 04:03.493
<i>I can rectify that.</i>
<i>The new me</i>
<i>can easily skip grades,</i>

04:03.493 --> 04:08.123
<i>become valedictorian,</i>
<i>get into any college,</i>
<i>earn my doctorates.</i>

04:08.123 --> 04:10.417
<i>How bad could this really be?</i>

04:10.417 --> 04:13.587
[grunting]
Parker!
We're locker buddies!

04:13.587 --> 04:15.589
How cool is that?

04:15.589 --> 04:19.092
[grunts]
Cool as the avian flu.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.720
Now put me down, Thompson!

04:21.720 --> 04:25.432
[laughing]
You're such a nerd.
How's it been, buddy?

04:25.432 --> 04:28.435
[groans]
I went to a school for geniuses.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.520
Now I am here.
Can you do the math?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.272
Oh, of course not.

04:32.272 --> 04:36.067
Since when could Flash Thompson
ever do math?

04:36.067 --> 04:39.905
Did Puny Parker
just burn me?

04:39.905 --> 04:43.116
Ohh! Little guy's
growing up.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.453
Hmm? Chemistry.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.331
Perhaps here they will
have components I could utilize

04:49.331 --> 04:51.082
to find Cloak's weakness.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.459
[girl clears throat]

04:54.252 --> 04:57.339
Oh! Hello.
I‐‐ I‐I did not‐‐

04:57.339 --> 04:59.841
See me? Go ahead.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.010
Say it. I dare you.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.138
No, I just did not know
anyone was‐‐

05:05.138 --> 05:07.140
Are you
the chemistry professor?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.810
Teaching assistant.
And you're a new face.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.312
Guessing you're
the Horizon flunky,
Peter Parker.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.689
"Flunky"?
I will have you‐‐

05:14.689 --> 05:18.985
Cool it, genius.
It was a compliment.
Horizon's overrated.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.989
Yes. Well, on that,
we can most certainly agree.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.284
Anna Maria Marconi.
And not that I believe in fate,

05:26.284 --> 05:28.370
but I was looking forward
to talking to you, Peter,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.455
and you stumbled
right into my class.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.707
Would you mind
taking a walk with me?

05:34.626 --> 05:38.463
Growing up, I was teased,
for obvious reasons.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.465
Children can be...

05:40.465 --> 05:42.425
Cruel. Yes.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.427
I'm quite familiar
with bullying.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.847
So my parents tried
to pull me from school

05:46.847 --> 05:48.849
and send me
to a private academy.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.977
A place where they thought
I had a better chance
of flourishing.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.979
A wise conclusion.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.022
No. You're missing
my point.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.484
I refused.
If I went to a place
where everyone was like me,

05:59.484 --> 06:01.736
then how could I
change things?

06:01.736 --> 06:06.408
Uh, well, that is... noble.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.952
Midtown has a real chance
to become a competitor

06:08.952 --> 06:10.412
with schools
like Horizon High.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.956
All it needs
is proper funding.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.208
And that's where
you come in.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.336
How? I am not
exactly an Osborn.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.130
I have no access
to funding.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.008
I don't need your money.
I need your time.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.553
Help me with
my sponsorship proposal
to Alchemax.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.930
An ex‐Horizon student like you
could go a long way

06:28.930 --> 06:31.391
in legitimizing everything
I'm trying to do here.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.519
Alchemax?
A top science firm.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.897
Its CEO, Tiberius Stone‐‐
<i>What?</i>

06:36.897 --> 06:39.357
...is offering public school
sponsorships.
<i>Could that be Cloak and Dagger?</i>

06:39.357 --> 06:41.776
Sponsorships that could really
turn this place around‐‐
<i>Students at Midtown High?</i>

06:41.776 --> 06:45.030
<i>I must investigate.</i>
...if we can impress him.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.449
Hello! Are you in?

06:47.449 --> 06:50.785
I'm finalizing
my pitch presentation
tonight after school.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.412
I really
could use your help.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.166
Yes. You can count on me.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.752
[running footfalls]

06:58.752 --> 07:02.088
Okay, so, how many times
have you transferred
your consciousness

07:02.088 --> 07:03.882
into different machines?

07:03.882 --> 07:05.884
<i>From my body</i>
<i>to the Neuro‐Cortex,</i>

07:05.884 --> 07:08.595
<i>to Horizon's servers,</i>
<i>to Ock's arms.</i>

07:08.595 --> 07:11.431
<i>So, uh, three times?</i>
<i>Why?</i>

07:11.431 --> 07:15.518
You know a photocopy
of a photocopy?
How it gets worse and worse?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.520
That's your
consciousness now.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.273
So, any more
machine‐to‐machine
mind transfers,

07:20.273 --> 07:21.941
then, most likely, poof!

07:21.941 --> 07:23.526
Bye‐bye, Peter Parker.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.695
Problem is,
even if we can get to Ock,

07:25.695 --> 07:28.740
how are we gonna switch
your mind back into your body?

07:28.740 --> 07:31.076
How did he switch
your mind out
in the first place?

07:31.076 --> 07:35.330
<i>He had this sort of lens thing</i>
<i>connected to the Neuro‐Cortex.</i>

07:35.330 --> 07:37.374
<i>I'd never seen it before.</i>

07:37.374 --> 07:40.293
Wait. A lens thing?
[drawer opens]

07:40.293 --> 07:42.879
Like this?
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

07:42.879 --> 07:46.675
Max gave it to me.
Said it was attached
to the Neuro‐Cortex.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.135
I think you and I
might be in business.

07:49.135 --> 07:53.640
<i>If I can get to Ock,</i>
<i>I'm sure I can convince him</i>
<i>to switch our bodies back.</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:55.642
<i>I know so much more</i>
<i>about him now.</i>

07:55.642 --> 07:57.644
<i>He and I</i>
<i>are not that different.</i>

07:57.644 --> 07:59.688
<i>I know there's a good person</i>
<i>inside him.</i>

07:59.688 --> 08:02.607
You really think Ock's
gonna listen to reason?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.442
He's not gonna give up
without a fight.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.611
<i>And if it comes to that,</i>
<i>I'm not in the most</i>

08:06.611 --> 08:09.656
<i>stable situation</i>
<i>to take him on, am I?</i>

08:09.656 --> 08:12.283
Luckily, I might have
a solution for that.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.120
I'm pretty sure I can
hook Ock's arms up to it

08:15.120 --> 08:17.706
without another mind transfer.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.208
Now, let's get your body back.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.295
<i>Cloak and Dagger must have</i>
<i>slipped out of school.</i>

08:24.295 --> 08:28.466
<i>And I'm getting no signs</i>
<i>of their energy readings.</i>

08:30.677 --> 08:32.554
[beeping]
There they are!

08:32.554 --> 08:35.890
I knew my equipment
would not fail.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.811
<i>Robbing another</i>
<i>high‐tech research facility?</i>
[beeps]

08:39.811 --> 08:42.063
<i>To what end?</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:46.693
<i>Even with Cloak's</i>
<i>teleportation powers,</i>
<i>they cannot escape me.</i>

08:51.239 --> 08:53.616
What? My data says
they are here.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.910
Could my readings be faulty?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.747
[Dagger]
We saw you following us,
Spider‐Man.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.540
We really didn't want
to have to do this.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.126
But we can't let you get
in the way of our plans.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.547
[grunting]

09:09.549 --> 09:12.343
[grunts]

09:12.343 --> 09:15.013
You are coming with me,
criminals.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.599
[yells]

09:17.599 --> 09:21.728
I will admit,
our last battle caught me
slightly off‐guard.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.939
Previous mistakes
are only opportunities
for improvement.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.735
[grunting]
And I never make
the same mistake twice!

09:28.735 --> 09:30.612
[grunting]

09:31.613 --> 09:32.697
[grunts]

09:41.581 --> 09:43.833

Dagger!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.586
Dagger, no. No.
[groaning]

09:46.586 --> 09:47.921
Come on.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.216
Is it clear now
that crime does not pay?

09:51.216 --> 09:53.676
You‐‐ You monster!
[yells]

09:53.676 --> 09:55.178

Put me down, brute!

10:02.602 --> 10:04.687

What‐‐ What did
you do to me?
[cries out]

10:07.816 --> 10:10.610

[cries out]

10:10.610 --> 10:13.446
Created a light blast
from a chemical compound

10:13.446 --> 10:17.659
I theorized would cause
a chain reaction overload
in your cape's negative void.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.661
Pure, simple hypothesis

10:19.661 --> 10:22.664
tested to
a positive conclusion.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.041
Please‐‐ Please,
you don't understand.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.793
Tell it to the police.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.419

10:32.590 --> 10:35.718
Aah!

10:35.718 --> 10:38.471
He's down, for now.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.434
Let's get outta here.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.231
[groans]
I had them!

10:48.231 --> 10:52.735
But I was too busy gloating
like a below‐average
super‐villain!

10:52.735 --> 10:55.113
[yells, pants]

10:56.948 --> 10:59.742
<i>Finally showing</i>
<i>the kind of aggression</i>
<i>this city needs,</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:02.912
<i>Spider‐Man takes down</i>
<i>two no‐account</i>
<i>super‐powered hoodlums.</i>

11:02.912 --> 11:05.582
<i>Aaahh!</i>
<i>Although the criminals</i>
<i>played dirty and got away,</i>

11:05.582 --> 11:10.295
<i>I have no doubt</i>
<i>this Superior Spider‐Man will</i>
<i>track them down in no time.</i>

11:10.295 --> 11:12.547
How's this heroic?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.549
Spidey's just way harsh.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.427
And what happened
to his fun red‐and‐blue costume?

11:17.427 --> 11:19.804
If you're bothered
by his successful tactics,

11:19.804 --> 11:23.016
perhaps you should start
a Spider‐Man suggestion box.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.518
Hey, that's actually
a pretty good idea.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.020
[chuckles]
Thanks, Pete.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.731
It was a jo‐‐
Mm. Hm.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.401
Hmm?

11:36.279 --> 11:38.948
<i>Private Midtown High files?</i>

11:38.948 --> 11:41.826
<i>Ha! As if that could</i>
<i>keep me out.</i>

11:41.826 --> 11:44.287
<i>Tandy Bowen</i>
<i>and Tyrone Johnson‐‐</i>

11:44.287 --> 11:48.208
<i>both new students here,</i>
<i>but with no</i>
<i>previous school listed.</i>

11:48.208 --> 11:51.336
<i>Yet I have ways of accessing</i>
<i>secret information.</i>

11:51.336 --> 11:54.797
<i>Let us learn a bit more</i>
<i>about where you two came from.</i>
[keyboard clacking]

11:54.797 --> 11:58.426
<i>Alchemax? Very interesting!</i>

11:58.426 --> 12:01.054
<i>Sorry, Tiberius Stone,</i>
<i>but you will not be able</i>

12:01.054 --> 12:04.349
<i>to keep me from breaking</i>
<i>into your system either.</i>

12:04.349 --> 12:06.351
[Anna Maria]
Oh, so here you are.
Huh? Oh.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.770
Is it wrong I was hoping
you were sick?

12:08.770 --> 12:10.939
Why would you hope
for my illness?

12:10.939 --> 12:13.107
Do you have a better excuse
for not meeting me

12:13.107 --> 12:15.610
to help with
the sponsorship presentation?

12:15.610 --> 12:19.072
Oh, I‐‐
Yesterday was‐‐ I‐‐

12:19.072 --> 12:22.575
I am sorry. Sincerely.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.702
"Sorry" is not going to help

12:24.702 --> 12:27.121
Midtown students
achieve greatness.

12:27.121 --> 12:30.792
I thought you might be
excited to help out.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.543
I'm not used
to being wrong.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.755
It's... disappointing.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.259
Anna Maria, please!

12:39.259 --> 12:41.261
I have had setbacks
as of late.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.054
Things I am adjusting to.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.515
But meeting you,
learning of your mission‐‐

12:45.515 --> 12:48.059
I understand what it is like
to be the underdog.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.478
And despite
my forgetful actions yesterday,

12:50.478 --> 12:53.564
I am 100% committed
to helping you.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.608
Don't help me,
help Midtown.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.403
Tiberius Stone
is arriving later today.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.614
If we win him over,
the sponsorship should be ours.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.825
I made a mistake
trusting you before.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.744
I don't make
the same mistake twice.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.122
Hmph. Neither do I.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.625
This should be everything,
right?
Yeah.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.669
Soon we'll get our chance.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.880
You think we'll really have
the guts to go through with it?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.882
We don't have a choice.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.803
Security bots?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.305
Interesting.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.849
Tiberius Stone
is paranoid.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.601
Doesn't leave the office
without them.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.646
Ah, you must be
Anna Maria.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.567
What a quaint... institution
you have here.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.111
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Stone.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.529
Huh?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.365
Personal force field technology
we've developed.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.076
Someone of my stature
can never be too careful.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.328
You understand.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.998
<i>The arrogance!</i>

13:51.998 --> 13:55.251
[Anna Maria]
So, this is where our
presentation will take place.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.337
Hope this facility
is up to Alchemax standards.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.424
Time's a‐wastin'.
I'm ready for your presentation
right now.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.634
Dazzle me.
[Cloak]
Don't worry, Stone.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.595
We will.
[yells]

14:08.347 --> 14:09.348
[grunts]

14:10.850 --> 14:14.645
Peter? Where‐‐
He just left?

14:14.645 --> 14:16.564
[grunts]

14:16.564 --> 14:19.567
And who are you two
fascinating specimens?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.486
You don't remember us?

14:21.486 --> 14:24.822
[Dagger]
Subjects 338 and 339?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.576
The experiments
you subjected us to?

14:28.576 --> 14:31.788
I can't keep track
of all the work I've done.

14:31.788 --> 14:35.083
In fact,
seeing you two in action,
you should thank me.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.377
I wasn't sure if I'd be able
to follow through today.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.379
Thank you for making this
much easier.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.174
[laughs]
I doubt very much

14:43.174 --> 14:45.259
there will be
anything easy about it.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.260
[beeps]

14:47.428 --> 14:48.429
Huh?

14:48.429 --> 14:50.473
No protective force field?

14:50.473 --> 14:52.016
Not so tough now,
are you?

14:52.016 --> 14:54.060
[whimpers]

14:54.060 --> 14:55.478
[yells]

14:55.478 --> 14:59.107
Midtown will not be the backdrop
to your petty revenge!

14:59.107 --> 15:02.318
"Petty"?
Stone ruined our lives!

15:02.318 --> 15:04.529
No doubt.
I discovered everything

15:04.529 --> 15:06.989
Alchemax secretly did
to you in their labs.

15:06.989 --> 15:11.410
Experimenting on innocents
for corporate gain? Pathetic!

15:11.410 --> 15:13.329
Spider‐Man, you have no‐‐
[muffled grunt]

15:13.329 --> 15:16.040
Once I deduced revenge
was your motive,

15:16.040 --> 15:19.210
I waited for this moment
to take you all down at once.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.421
There are no shades of gray
when it comes
to right and wrong.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.925
You are all criminals
who need to be brought
to justice!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.009
[grunts]

15:27.009 --> 15:28.386
[grunts]

15:28.386 --> 15:29.512
[grunts]

15:29.512 --> 15:31.305
[yells, groans]

15:31.305 --> 15:35.518
Our lives were stolen
from us by Stone,
and you won't do the same!

15:35.518 --> 15:37.812
[whistles]
Hey, star‐bright!

15:37.812 --> 15:39.647
[grunts]
[yells]

15:39.647 --> 15:41.566
[yells]

15:42.358 --> 15:43.568
[yelling]

15:43.568 --> 15:45.444
Get to safety!
[grunts]

15:45.444 --> 15:46.612
[yells]

15:46.612 --> 15:49.031
This is too dangerous!

15:49.031 --> 15:51.033
We're pulling
our application, Stone.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.412
Midtown has no interest
in a sponsorship from Alchemax.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.039
[grunting]

15:59.375 --> 16:00.543
[grunts, groans]

16:03.671 --> 16:05.673
[grunting]

16:07.675 --> 16:09.218
[yells]
[grunts]

16:09.218 --> 16:10.469
[groans]

16:10.469 --> 16:12.346

16:25.776 --> 16:27.862
[groaning]

16:29.530 --> 16:31.991
[yells]
[Stone]
It's a shame, Spider‐Man.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.411
I always thought if we'd met,
we'd be allies.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.621
I guess not.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.168
[grunts]
[Stone]
Don't think I'm not impressed

16:42.168 --> 16:44.962
you managed to learn some of
Alchemax's biggest secrets.
[straining]

16:44.962 --> 16:49.050
But, unfortunately,
that's only more reason
to destroy you!

16:49.050 --> 16:53.512
Your tech is brilliant,
and yet you use it
for the most selfish endeavors.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.307
You are not truly
a man of science.

16:56.307 --> 16:59.268
Who are you to lecture me
about science?
[grunts]

16:59.268 --> 17:00.937
Aah!
[grunts]

17:00.937 --> 17:03.064
[groans]

17:05.066 --> 17:07.693
[groaning]
It's almost poetic,

17:07.693 --> 17:10.238
squishing
Spider‐Man underfoot,

17:10.238 --> 17:12.490
just like a bug.
[groaning intensifies]

17:12.490 --> 17:15.076
[laughing]

17:15.076 --> 17:17.536
Huh?
[yells]

17:17.536 --> 17:19.538
This is what gloating
gets you.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.124
Trust me,
it has been a long lesson...

17:22.124 --> 17:23.417
[grunts]

17:23.417 --> 17:25.086
[groans]

17:25.086 --> 17:27.296
...but one worth remembering.

17:27.296 --> 17:32.593
[sighs]
Thank you, Anna Maria,
for shutting down his‐‐ What?

17:32.593 --> 17:36.222
<i>[Peter]</i>
<i>I shut it down, Ock,</i>
<i>and now I need my body back.</i>

17:36.222 --> 17:39.600
Parker? You survived?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.687
<i>I had access</i>
<i>to your memories, Otto.</i>

17:42.687 --> 17:44.939
<i>I know you're better</i>
<i>than this.</i>

17:44.939 --> 17:49.569
<i>There's good inside you,</i>
<i>but you've been twisted up,</i>
<i>broken.</i>

17:49.569 --> 17:53.155
<i>Let's fix all this.</i>
<i>Do the right thing.</i>

17:53.155 --> 17:55.533
I <i>am</i> doing the right thing.

17:55.533 --> 17:59.537
<i>Otto, I'm not gonna lie.</i>
<i>I'm running out of time.</i>

17:59.537 --> 18:04.333
<i>I need my body back before</i>
<i>the actions you've started</i>
<i>destroy me forever.</i>

18:04.333 --> 18:05.918
<i>I'm certain</i>
<i>if we work together,</i>

18:05.918 --> 18:08.796
<i>we can put your mind back</i>
<i>in your original body too.</i>

18:08.796 --> 18:11.507
You do not get it, do you?

18:11.507 --> 18:15.636
My entire life,
I have always considered
my accomplishments great,

18:15.636 --> 18:17.346
worthy of people's admiration.

18:17.346 --> 18:22.018
But time and time again,
I was denied,
laughed at, bullied!

18:22.018 --> 18:25.688
I tried not to care.
I persevered.

18:25.688 --> 18:29.191
But even at Horizon,
it was still never enough!

18:29.191 --> 18:32.778
I am a better Peter Parker
than you could ever be!

18:32.778 --> 18:37.491
But more importantly,
I am a superior Spider‐Man!

18:37.491 --> 18:41.871
My answer to your request
is a resounding "no"!

18:41.871 --> 18:45.207
<i>[sighs]</i>
<i>I was hoping</i>
<i>to avoid fighting you.</i>

18:45.207 --> 18:46.584
It was inevitable.

18:46.584 --> 18:50.671
We are enemies.
Always will be!

18:58.929 --> 19:00.848
[grunts]
This is fitting.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.643
[grunts]
If the only way I can prove
my superiority

19:03.643 --> 19:05.936
is through physical combat,
so‐‐
[grunts]

19:05.936 --> 19:10.066
Hi, Ock. Knowing it's you
in there explains a lot.
[panting]

19:10.066 --> 19:12.151
Morales! Good.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.153
I was never
quite done with you.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.073
Happy to settle everything
once and for all.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.367

Morales is down,
and you are next!

20:05.371 --> 20:08.207
<i>Please, Otto.</i>
<i>You can end this.</i>

20:08.207 --> 20:11.377
<i>Prove everyone wrong.</i>
<i>Do the right thing!</i>

20:11.377 --> 20:14.755
You're acting out of emotion,
not logic, Parker.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.967
The world does not need you.
It needs me!

20:27.309 --> 20:29.979
<i>You can never</i>
<i>truly be Spider‐Man!</i>

20:29.979 --> 20:31.689
Stop talking!
[grunts]

20:31.689 --> 20:34.400
<i>You're not Peter Parker.</i>

20:34.400 --> 20:36.193
<i>You're Otto Octavius!</i>

20:36.193 --> 20:39.488
<i>Do the right thing.</i>
<i>You can be a good man!</i>

20:39.488 --> 20:42.700
No. Just the superior one.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.077
I will take good care
of your life, Peter.
[kick blow lands]

20:45.077 --> 20:47.788
Rest easy.
Your legacy lives on.

20:47.788 --> 20:51.959
<i>Please... don't...</i>
<i>do this.</i>
<i>[static]</i>

20:51.959 --> 20:54.795
Good‐bye.

Not yet!

Come on, Pete.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.058
[groans, grunts]

21:08.058 --> 21:10.227
They retreated?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.729
Do you see?

21:11.729 --> 21:14.315
No one can beat me.

21:14.315 --> 21:18.402
No one can beat
the Superior Spider‐Man!

21:18.402 --> 21:20.196
Oh, come on, Pete.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.073
Please tell me
your consciousness
is still alive in there!

21:23.073 --> 21:24.950
Yes! Don't worry.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.703
I can fix this.
I‐I can fix this.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.539
I can fix this.
I can fix this.
