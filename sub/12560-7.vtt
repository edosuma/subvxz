I'm hank.

00:01.650 --> 00:05.500
I was your typicalemergencyroom
doctor until I got fired.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.880
You let a billionairehospital trustee
die to save some kidoff the street.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.940
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.610
He took meaway from my
troubles and to the hamptons.

00:17.610 --> 00:21.040
And suddenly,I had a chance to
becomea whole new kind of doctor.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.900
Turns out the wealthyand not so wealthy out
here could use a guywho makes house calls.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.830

backtomorrow and draw some blood.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.090
Why wait until tomorrow?

01:03.090 --> 01:05.570
You have to fastfor eight hours.

01:05.570 --> 01:07.870

01:47.410 --> 01:49.830
What kind of side trip?

01:51.200 --> 01:52.390
Tomorrow?

01:52.390 --> 01:54.800
That's short notice.

01:55.260 --> 01:57.600
No,no,no,of course I want to see you.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.920
II'll just have to
jugglesome things around.

I'M...I'm working this weekend.

02:20.550 --> 02:24.040
Raj,I'll haveto call you back.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.910
You're too far forward.You'll
perlwhen you hit the water.

02:30.910 --> 02:33.170
Well,I don't knowwhat "perling" means.

02:33.170 --> 02:34.580
Maybe it's somethingI want to do.

02:34.580 --> 02:35.980
Trust me,it's not.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.110
Oh,my god,just get in the water already!

02:38.110 --> 02:39.940
Okay,whatever.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.780
- Okay,so check this out.
- Hi,there.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.280
You looking for somebody?

02:43.280 --> 02:45.110
Maybe somebody who knowshow
to surf without perling?

02:45.110 --> 02:46.300
You got me.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.930
I like to base my
relationshipson surfing technique.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.660
Katie.

02:50.660 --> 02:53.270
I didn't knowyou were coming
in,or I would have picked you up.

02:53.270 --> 02:54.170
Oh,no,it's fine.

02:54.170 --> 02:58.230
I'm actuallyyou know what?I don't
even surf.I'm more of a turf guy.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.520
What are you doing in town?

03:00.520 --> 03:03.640
Oh,it's along story,but
the short versionboris.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.400
Boris?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.910
Wait,your research project.

03:06.910 --> 03:09.080
Yeah,he agreed to fund it,I think.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.680
Kind of hard to tellwith the accent.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.590
Oh,my god,katie,that's amazing.

03:12.590 --> 03:14.410
That is awesome.Congratulations.

03:14.410 --> 03:17.940
This callsfor a celebration,in fact,a
big one,where thingsget all crazy,

03:17.940 --> 03:19.600
and okay,please tell methis isn't him.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.550
No.

03:20.550 --> 03:22.850
This is hank.

03:22.850 --> 03:23.930
Nice to meet you.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.820
I've heard a lot about you.

03:25.820 --> 03:27.590
I'll assumethat's a good thing.

03:27.590 --> 03:31.930
And this is his brother,evan
R.Lawson,cfo of hankmed.

03:31.930 --> 03:34.080
I think that
introductionspeaks for itself.

03:34.080 --> 03:38.200
So this one's the cfo,and
this one's the M.S.G.?

03:38.200 --> 03:39.880
M.S.What?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.450
It's nothing.

03:41.450 --> 03:42.760
Anyway,I should get to work.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.720
You know,with boris,the
clock's always ticking.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.480
All right,well,I'll call you later.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.300
- Good meeting you.Bye.
- Good to meet you too.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.350
Bye,katie.Bye.

03:51.350 --> 03:53.530
What's an M.S.G.?

03:53.530 --> 03:55.370
Medical super god.

03:55.370 --> 03:56.600
Oh,all right.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.500
Miniature sex gimp.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.030
Mumbling snow gerbil.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.940
Hey,divya.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.220
You seem to be walking okay.

04:06.220 --> 04:07.870
Can you move your arms for me?

04:07.870 --> 04:10.160
What do my armshave to do with walking?

04:10.160 --> 04:12.330
Oh,no,it's just a testfor
neurological damage.

04:12.330 --> 04:13.930
Look,I think you're fine.

04:13.930 --> 04:15.510
She didn't loseconsciousness.

04:15.510 --> 04:17.920
In fact,she's been
quiteanimated since the accident.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.750
You know,I was aboutto call
911,and then she told me about you.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.550
No problem.I just need to
irrigatethese abrasions.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.820
Listen,I hear you treatthe
who's who out here.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.430
That dependswho who you talk to.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.480
Mi amor.Are you hurt?

04:29.480 --> 04:32.000
Oh,god.Javier,it was awful.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.450
She drove right in front of me.

04:33.450 --> 04:34.540
I did no such thing.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.720
Yes,you did.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.020
How did you find me?

04:39.020 --> 04:40.390
What is that?

04:40.390 --> 04:42.380
Oh,I just bought it.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.820
Trevor said that it wasthe
musthave for the summer.

04:44.820 --> 04:47.050
- Who's trevor?
- He's just a salesman,you know?

04:47.050 --> 04:49.970
And he said that it matchedmy
spirit and my jimmy choos.

04:49.970 --> 04:54.320
We can't keep buying vehicles just
becausethey match your outfits.

04:55.780 --> 05:00.060
What about mymy neardeath experience?

05:09.940 --> 05:11.940
You should goto the hospital.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.440
You need stitches.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.520
Hank,couldcould you do it,please?

05:15.520 --> 05:17.000
He's the best there isout here.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.100
I can't take care of it here.I need
a cleaner environmentand less kissing.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.870
Oh,I just gotout of a hospital.

05:22.870 --> 05:23.820
Why?

05:23.820 --> 05:26.680
'Cause I went up a cup size,in rio.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.250
Long trip for an extra cup.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.890
It was javier's idea.

05:30.890 --> 05:32.980
He knows the top plastic
surgeonover there.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.330
Anything for sofia.

05:34.330 --> 05:35.400
Exactly.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.540
Including you.Come to our home.

05:37.540 --> 05:39.670
Up the road,number 57.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.260
All right.

05:41.260 --> 05:43.330
Â¿Esta bien,bonita?

05:43.330 --> 05:48.110

05:48.110 --> 05:49.980
Or they're in love.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.400
Come on.

05:57.670 --> 06:00.360
So,jill,can I interest youin
one of my house specialties?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.990

06:02.990 --> 06:04.550
Maybe a pensacola bushwhacker?

06:04.550 --> 06:06.330
Martini?

06:06.330 --> 06:07.540
Grey goose?

06:07.540 --> 06:08.530
Perfect.

06:08.530 --> 06:10.640
Done and done.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.020
Anyway,katie's been trying forever
to get this project financed,

06:14.020 --> 06:15.730
but shecouldn't interest anyone.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.220
I'm interested.

06:17.220 --> 06:18.700
What's she researching?

06:18.700 --> 06:22.060
- Epigonal organs,immunology 
- I'm already bored.

06:22.060 --> 06:23.890
Of course.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.620
Try that on for size.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.040
Nice job,evan.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.000
Okay,so where was I?

06:37.260 --> 06:42.150
Oh,and thenI introduced her to boris at the
same memorial day partywhere I met you,hank.

06:42.150 --> 06:44.390
Hey,that wasa good night all around.

06:44.390 --> 06:46.630
God,that feels like ages ago.

06:46.630 --> 06:48.270
You say thatlike it's a bad thing.

06:48.270 --> 06:49.190
No,no,no,no.

06:49.190 --> 06:51.420
No,I just no,I meant thatit
hasn't been that long,

06:51.420 --> 06:54.250
but it feels like ain a good way.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.800
- Never mind.
- You're welcome for that,by the way.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.120
You know,dragging you out
toboris' party in the first place,

06:59.120 --> 07:00.280
getting you and jilltogether.

07:00.280 --> 07:04.310
Oh,okay,so you're gonna take credit for
everything that happensin my life postbrooklyn?

07:04.310 --> 07:06.230
Man,a butterflyflaps its wings.

07:06.230 --> 07:09.390
Okay,so about this M.S.G.Thing...

07:09.390 --> 07:11.760
it's not a thing.It's
really no big deal.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.370
Macho surfing guru,right?No?

07:14.370 --> 07:16.400
Mucusspewing growth?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.110
Mucusspewing what?

07:18.110 --> 07:19.920
Okay,he doesn't make you
laugh.I make you laugh.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.750
He's in denial.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.230
And it's been nearlya full day of this.

07:22.230 --> 07:23.860
How are younot sick of him yet?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.040
He's funny.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.710
Yeah,funniest third wheelI've ever met.

07:26.710 --> 07:30.110
That's true,and this jalopyneeds a fourth
wheel.Just hook me upwith katie,will you?

07:30.110 --> 07:32.890
Don't you want your friendto be
happy and really,really satisfied?

07:32.890 --> 07:35.700
I think we're all
really,really uncomfortable.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.940
Although I got to say,she is impressive.

07:37.940 --> 07:41.640
Pitching an epigonalorgan studyat
a summer house party?That's badass.

07:41.640 --> 07:42.880
Yeah,that's katie.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.640
To boris,no less,who's probably gonna keep them
in his freezerwith his humanhead collection.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.660
Boris does not collecthuman heads.

07:48.660 --> 07:51.880
How do you know that?'Cause he's
very privateand fairly mysterious.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.350
Or fairly privateand
veryvery mysterious.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.040
I'm sure there are thingsabout
boris that none of us know.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.670
Yeah,he's a good guy.

07:59.670 --> 08:03.320
He's been good to
me,to katie,to you guys.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.000
Oh,yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.330
He justhe likes things
quiet,controlled,predictable.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.960
Hello?

08:18.400 --> 08:21.840

08:54.400 --> 08:56.250
Will she need stitches?

08:56.250 --> 08:58.610
No,they're shallow marks.

08:58.610 --> 09:02.640
Hank,let me tell jill about
this.She has a tendency to overreact.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.830
Well,I couldn't tell her anyway.

09:04.830 --> 09:07.370
Patient confidentiality.

09:07.370 --> 09:08.960
Did you see what bit you?

09:08.960 --> 09:10.540
No,I was in the ocean.

09:10.540 --> 09:13.190
At this hour?

09:13.820 --> 09:17.080
I love night swimming.I
felt something tug at my leg.

09:17.080 --> 09:23.950
Between the bite pattern and
this tooth,I'm thinking shark.

09:24.340 --> 09:25.490
We better report it.

09:25.490 --> 09:27.950
Yeah,you can leave that to me.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.780
There you are.You want some eggs?

09:40.780 --> 09:41.760
No,I don'T.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.020
That's good,'cause I
only made enough for me.

09:44.020 --> 09:47.990
So,uh,listen.I've been,uh I've been
brainstorming the katie situation.

09:47.990 --> 09:49.950
And I mean,it's perfect.

09:49.950 --> 09:52.390
Like,come on,brothers
dating best friends?

09:52.390 --> 09:55.010
It's like,can you see
the '80s movie montage?

09:55.010 --> 09:57.560
So I was thinking we
have dinner here tonight.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.160
You and jill laugh at my jokes.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.480
You swoon over my cooking,and
then at some point,

10:01.480 --> 10:04.240
you just remember like,"oh,my god.We
got to go surfing," or whatever,

10:04.240 --> 10:07.890
and leave me and katie alone to just get
to know each other.What do you say to that?

10:07.890 --> 10:11.630
I say the last thing I'm doing is
getting in the water after dark.

10:11.630 --> 10:13.200
I need you to do some research.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.250
Look,I don't know what "perling" means.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.030
Why don't you just research it yourself?

10:17.030 --> 10:22.310
Pick up the phone,and find out
who to call to report a shark bite.

10:23.020 --> 10:27.650
Um,whywhy do you need that information?

10:27.650 --> 10:28.970
Why do you care?You
don't go in the water

10:28.970 --> 10:31.600
unless it's got the foam noodle
thingies and a swimup bar.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.390
I'm just wondering for
billing purposes,man.

10:33.390 --> 10:34.600
I justyou know,I need to know.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.250
It's a boris thing,and we're
not billing him,so can you call?

10:37.250 --> 10:39.920
Boris got bit?Where?

10:39.920 --> 10:43.260
Like,geographically where,as well
as on his body.Like,was it bad,or...?

10:43.260 --> 10:47.160
Evan,you know there's only
so much I can tell you.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.260
What's with all the questions?

10:49.260 --> 10:52.110
Oh,boy.Okay.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.560
Look,I know something
I'm not supposed to know.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.400
I'm definitelynot supposed to
tell anyone,so you know what?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.950
Don't even ask me,'cause I can't tell.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.260
You tell me right now,or

11:01.260 --> 11:03.970
boris has a sharkin his basement.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.310
Okay,yeah,no.I mean,sure.

11:06.310 --> 11:09.050
Boris has a sharkin his basement.

11:09.050 --> 11:12.590
Henry,I'm serious.I saw it.

11:12.590 --> 11:16.480
Up close,in person.

11:25.190 --> 11:28.350
There she is.How you doing?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.840
Alex!

11:36.570 --> 11:37.870
Hi.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.510
You look amazing.

11:42.510 --> 11:43.700
I thought you were working.

11:43.700 --> 11:48.500
I figuredthat you need a
decent,halfcaff soy latte.

11:49.290 --> 11:50.940
Are you okay?

11:50.940 --> 11:51.750
Were you hurt?

11:51.750 --> 11:54.090
It was just a scooter.I'm fine.

11:54.090 --> 11:56.270
And the carwas just a bit scratched.

11:56.270 --> 12:00.020
You had it at the shop firstthing
this morning,didn't you?

12:00.990 --> 12:04.160
So,uh,tell mewhy dad brought you here.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.580
Construction schedulefor
the london hotel.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.880
We can't open it soon
enoughfor his taste.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.840
Flew me infor a facetoface meeting.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.700
But it's your tastethat will make
the place work,whenever it opens.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.120
Can't waitfor you both to see it.

12:16.120 --> 12:20.860
Well,we'll,uh we'll be in
londonfor the wedding,I guess.

12:20.860 --> 12:24.230
I heard ourengagementparty
announcements were mailed.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.340
Is this really happening?

12:27.340 --> 12:31.530
I think if we postponethe engagement
again,my dad will disown me.

12:31.530 --> 12:34.240
And bury mein the hotel's foundation.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.590
I guess we better do it.

12:37.160 --> 12:42.390
Raj I,uh... I brought you something.

12:42.390 --> 12:45.380
Our mothers both insisted that
you present that to meat the party.

12:45.380 --> 12:48.110
Just...open it.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.630
A cricothyrotomy tube.

12:58.630 --> 13:00.010
And a key chain.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.890
A goodluck giftfor your new business.

13:07.310 --> 13:09.670
Speaking of.

13:09.670 --> 13:11.750
Go.We'll see each otherlater,right?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.760
Of course.Of course.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.020
I promise.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.170
You have a sharkin your basement.

13:31.340 --> 13:34.470
You call me overfor a medical
emergency and then lie to me about it.

13:34.470 --> 13:39.410
You scare the hellout of my brother,and
then you ask himto lie to me too?

13:40.770 --> 13:43.930
I need to knowwhat's going on.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.870
Katie studies them.

13:47.870 --> 13:51.580
So when this one became
ill,I called on her.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.380
It's sick?

13:53.380 --> 13:55.280
Well,not anymore.

13:55.280 --> 14:01.970
Quite commonly,sharks in
captivityhave trouble with buoyancy.

14:01.970 --> 14:06.810
Katie went in the tankto feed her
through her stomach and help her float.

14:06.810 --> 14:10.830
Okay,so that'swhy katie was in
there,but why is the shark in there?

14:10.830 --> 14:12.830
Is thatmedically relevant,hank?

14:12.830 --> 14:16.850
No,it's not,but right nowI feel like
I'm living on a bond villain's property,

14:16.850 --> 14:23.120
so explain it to me,or I'm packing
up my stuff,and I'm leaving.

14:27.980 --> 14:30.600
I like you,hank.

14:31.350 --> 14:35.240
This animalwas meant
for research in maryland,

14:35.240 --> 14:39.530
but I began to lose faithin
the facility down there.

14:39.530 --> 14:43.110
So katie's gonna researchthe shark here.

14:43.110 --> 14:46.480
She's considering it,yes.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.500
I called because you areclearly
overcharging me for the services provided.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.740
No,we're justregularcharging.

14:57.740 --> 15:02.700
I see the pricefor a stitch,one stitch.

15:03.340 --> 15:04.070
It's absurd.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.520
What would you suggest?Buy
nine stitches,get one free?

15:07.520 --> 15:11.350
Like,free wound cleaningon fridays?

15:12.960 --> 15:15.320
Sofia changed her
mindabout the upholstery.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.430
I don't blame her.

15:16.430 --> 15:20.290
Now,about payingfor her
health care,I mean...

15:20.290 --> 15:22.620
it's too much.I won't pay it.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.400
Okay there,highlander.Why
don't we justput the knife down?

15:25.400 --> 15:28.520
Knife?I deal in antique weapons.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.160
This is a misericord.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.110
Okay,then putthe "misegaba" thing down.

15:33.110 --> 15:34.590
It's french for "mercy.

15:34.590 --> 15:38.360
" Knights used itto give the final
stroke to the mortally wounded.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.780
I'm notmortally wounded,dude.

15:39.780 --> 15:42.780
In fact,I feel fine,and I'd
feel a lot better if you'd just

15:42.780 --> 15:47.440
I made my first dollar selling
mygreatgreatgrandfather's sword from valencia.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.700
Each dollar since thenis
thanks to his legacy.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.410
He'd be enragedby these numbers.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.400
So you're blaming mefor inflation?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.940
Mr.Santos,uh,you paged me?

15:56.940 --> 15:58.080
No,I did,divya.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.470
Please tell zorro here that you
performed allthe procedures on this bill.

16:02.470 --> 16:03.980
You paged meto go over a bill?

16:03.980 --> 16:05.550
An inflated bill.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.710
You saw my wife.She's flawless.

16:07.710 --> 16:10.270
Uh,we do injuriesand
illnesses,not flaws,buddy,okay?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.690
No,no,actually,we do do flaws.

16:11.690 --> 16:13.410
She barely hada scratch on her.

16:13.410 --> 16:15.810
Yeah,except for all the
onesthat needed stitches.

16:15.810 --> 16:18.670
Never mind.It's on the house.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.680
What?It's on whose house?Your
house?It's not on my house.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.620
We'll talk about it outside.

16:29.220 --> 16:32.900
So which one of us is the evan
R.Lawson,cfo of hankmed,around here?

16:32.900 --> 16:34.310
It's a minor bill.

16:34.310 --> 16:36.390
There's no such thingas
a minor bill,divya.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.870
It won't break the bank.

16:37.870 --> 16:42.060
Okay,look,I understand you were
raised with a silver spoon up your

16:42.060 --> 16:43.490
but I would like to makea profit.

16:43.490 --> 16:45.090
Besides,I do billing.

16:45.090 --> 16:46.360
You do "mediciney" stuff.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.670
Okay,they're notworth it,evan.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.600
What do you mean "they"?What's
your problem with them?

16:49.600 --> 16:53.680
First of all,I don't like their
pretendloveydovey nonsense,

16:53.680 --> 16:59.290
which is only thereto compensate for
whatever is absentin their "relationship.

17:00.030 --> 17:02.750
" Second,they keep wrecking my car.

17:08.210 --> 17:12.510
She said her visionblurred for a
moment,causing her to crashinto my car,again.

17:12.510 --> 17:14.660
I suspected a concussionfrom
the vespa accident.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.030
Yeah,but the ct's clean.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.240
Have you ruled out cd?

17:17.240 --> 17:18.390
Chronic duane syndrome?

17:18.390 --> 17:19.490
Crappy driving.

17:19.490 --> 17:21.390
This pain is unbearable.

17:21.390 --> 17:23.230
Are there no more teststo perform?

17:23.230 --> 17:24.550
We could do an mri.

17:24.550 --> 17:25.550
What would that do?

17:25.550 --> 17:28.160
- Rule outother possibilities.
- It would alsoadd to your bill.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.360
Papi,it seemslike I need it.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.800
This is whatwe charge for it.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.370
We rent thison a perpatient
basis,so it costs a ton,

17:34.370 --> 17:38.470
meaning it'll cost you a ton,plus a
little bit,because we have to eat too.

17:38.470 --> 17:39.870
You could goto hampton's heritage.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.200
Your insurancemight cover it.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.000
- A hospital?
- No.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.420
No more hospitals,not for her.

17:45.420 --> 17:47.110
All right,well,if you
don'twant to go to the hospital,

17:47.110 --> 17:49.650
I could try to get an mri
truckhere by this evening.

17:49.650 --> 17:50.830
What should we do until then?

17:50.830 --> 17:51.980
She should be fine.

17:51.980 --> 17:54.270
But call usif her mental status changes.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.860
Like if shesuddenly becomes sane?

17:56.860 --> 17:58.970
Can you handle the mri?

18:08.790 --> 18:10.420
You really thinkit's safe to go home?

18:10.420 --> 18:13.180
Like,you don't understand.Boris
was really,really serious

18:13.180 --> 18:15.120
about me keeping
hisdeep,dark shark secret,

18:15.120 --> 18:19.520
and I really don't wantto be thrown in his
hedge maze to be goredby a minotaur or something.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.830
Don't worry.No more secrets.Just stay
out of his wayand out of his hedge maze.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.600
What was the bigmystery
anyway,by the way?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.750
Katie's some kindof shark expert.

18:27.750 --> 18:28.850
She's doing research there.

18:28.850 --> 18:32.200
Clearly she's not an expert,'cause an
expert would knowthat sharks eat people.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.060
Apparently she does itall the time.

18:34.060 --> 18:36.550
She's got some cojones,man.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.380
If she actually had cojones and
you saw themwhen you treated her,

18:39.380 --> 18:40.430
you couldn't even tell me,could you?

18:40.430 --> 18:42.910
Nope,couldn'T.Confidentiality.

18:42.910 --> 18:45.540
Just please keepthe drool in
check when they come over later.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.500
No promises.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.730
One minute they're fighting,and
the nextthey're all over each other.

18:55.730 --> 18:56.840
Sounds like a lot of drama.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.500
The medical term is insane.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.130
Maybe her conditionis psychosomatic.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.730
Attentionseekingomatic.

19:03.730 --> 19:08.000
Did I mentionthat she makes
him jealous on purpose?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I mean,what's wrongwith these people?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.770
An exhausting way to live.

19:11.770 --> 19:15.460
I mean,we workin different
cities,and there's no jealousy.

19:15.460 --> 19:19.280
Of course not.We trustand
respect each other.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.550
Leave the dramato the teenagers
and your insane patients.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.610
Yes.

19:25.610 --> 19:28.270
We're very lucky.

19:29.570 --> 19:32.540
Okay,close your arm up,please.

19:32.540 --> 19:36.170
So I'm just gonna run a
standardcbc and chem panel on this,

19:36.170 --> 19:37.140
should be back by tomorrow.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.240
Efficient.Where will you send it?

19:39.240 --> 19:40.820
Hampton's heritage.

19:40.820 --> 19:44.820
Of course.Jill's
hospital.Very convenient.

19:44.820 --> 19:49.410
So complete blood countand
chem panel,let's do that.

19:49.410 --> 19:50.650
Thank you,hank.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.350
Sure.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.330
What,are you feelingnauseated?

20:00.330 --> 20:02.440
Only when I lookat my reflection.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.140
Nausea's a signof a concussion.

20:04.140 --> 20:06.830
Well,then this gownis giving me one.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.930
You needto remove your jewelry.

20:08.930 --> 20:11.390
- Why?
- An mri is a giant magnet.

20:11.390 --> 20:16.600
You can remove it now,or the
machinewill do it for you and not gently.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.540
You think you know me,but you don'T.

20:20.540 --> 20:23.620
All you see are these.

20:23.620 --> 20:28.270
He bought me this one because he
stayed away too longon business

20:29.210 --> 20:33.850
and then this onejust because he
thought I looked beautifulone afternoon.

20:34.770 --> 20:37.310
You want to know what I see?

20:37.310 --> 20:40.150
I see this.

20:40.150 --> 20:44.950
When we met in caracas,this was
the only thinghe could afford.

20:44.950 --> 20:49.680
He bought itfrom a street
vendor,and I love it.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.900
Well,that's very charming.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.110
And then we locked ourselvesin
a motel room for,like,

20:54.110 --> 20:58.440
three daysof
nonstop,earthmoving,carnal feasting.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.950
It was amazing.

21:00.950 --> 21:03.470
Right.Well,that's not so charming.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.780
Your boyfriend?

21:11.780 --> 21:13.850
Yes.

21:14.290 --> 21:18.690
I mean,no,it's I'll call him back.

21:18.690 --> 21:22.260
You know,I would never
ignorea call from javier,ever.

21:22.260 --> 21:25.690
Just to hear his
voicemakes me want to...

21:29.250 --> 21:31.260
I can't believeyou're here all summer.

21:31.260 --> 21:34.360
I love coming home,seeing
who's changed,seeing who hasn'T.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.610
Making fun of the "citiots.

21:35.610 --> 21:36.990
" Oh,yeah,hate the citiots.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.600
Evan,we're the citiots.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.110
Still?

21:40.110 --> 21:41.440
It'll be just likewhen we were kids.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.680
Except you'll haveyour very own shark.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.830
Katie,have you ever seen jaws?

21:45.830 --> 21:46.930
Oh,he's gonna regret that.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.320
Evan,do you knowhow many people
are killedby snake bites each year?

21:49.320 --> 21:51.060
- No.
- 50000

21:51.060 --> 21:52.660
- Sharks kill six.
- All right.

21:52.660 --> 21:54.200
How many do they just bite?

21:54.200 --> 21:55.560
It was a love bite.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.950
She's new to captivity.

21:56.950 --> 21:58.140
I'll takevery good care of her.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.000
And she'll chew on your
torsountil you stop thrashing.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.990
Oh,you just dugyour own grave.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.940
- Yeah,he's no msg.
- No.

22:05.400 --> 22:09.620
Don't worry,though.All you missedwas a
couple months of casual,really good sex.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.870
Whoa,whoa,whoa.Okay,I'm an msg.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.600
Look,what the hell is an msg?

22:13.660 --> 22:16.070
You guys got to tell uswhat
that means.It's enough already.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.300
It's stupid.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.890
Medieval slut gatherer.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.730
Man seeking guacamole.

22:20.820 --> 22:23.690
- Manatee
- all right,seriously,put usout of our misery,please.

22:23.770 --> 22:27.450
Yes,save yourselves.I cannot
hear one more of these.

22:27.530 --> 22:30.680
It means "my summer guy.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.990
" My summer guy?Isn't
thatthe judy blume novel?

22:33.070 --> 22:34.640
We came up with itin seventh grade.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.960
You came up with it.

22:36.010 --> 22:39.250
No,I really thinkjudy came up with
it.I read that.I loved that book.

22:39.350 --> 22:42.260
That's because you
alwaysran in heartfirst.

22:42.330 --> 22:44.840
All of jill's
exboyfriendsare summer guys.

22:45.310 --> 22:46.630
Not all of them.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.360
It's the price we paid
forgrowing up in a summer hotspot.

22:49.430 --> 22:52.380
The boys just come herefor the
summer,so you can't get too invested.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.290
And they can't burn
youif you beat them to it.

22:56.380 --> 22:59.180
So there's a mass grave
ofburnt msgs our here somewhere?

22:59.230 --> 23:01.570
Yeah,very few make itto labor day.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.130
What happenedafter labor day?

23:04.550 --> 23:06.470
Well,everyone's goneby then.

23:06.530 --> 23:08.730
You'll see,if you stick around.

23:08.810 --> 23:11.070
What is your plan,hank?

23:11.680 --> 23:14.500
I don't know.II hadn't
thoughtthat far ahead.

23:18.350 --> 23:20.630
***

23:21.290 --> 23:22.790
Sorry,guys.II got to go.

23:22.850 --> 23:24.630
Divya has an emergency.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.110
Sorry.

23:31.270 --> 23:34.060
So this should help usfigure
out why you're feeling worse.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.150
Don't worry.It won't hurt.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.910
- It's just really loud.
- Where's javier?

23:38.970 --> 23:40.710
He'll be herewhen you get out.

23:44.690 --> 23:45.950
Okay.

23:56.710 --> 23:59.830
Turn it off.Turn it off!

24:00.410 --> 24:02.190
Let me out of here!

24:04.070 --> 24:07.730
Oh,my god.Oh,my god.Oh,my god.

24:07.790 --> 24:09.780
What's happening?

24:14.410 --> 24:16.610
Just stay calm,sofia.Everything's
gonna be okay.

24:16.730 --> 24:18.460
What is that thing?

24:18.520 --> 24:19.530
Have you ever broken a bone?

24:19.660 --> 24:22.280
I mean,the doctorsmay have
inserted a metal pin to repair it?

24:22.350 --> 24:25.100
She hada breast augmentation.Maybe
the surgeonleft something in.

24:25.210 --> 24:26.920
Whatever it is,I want it out.

24:26.980 --> 24:29.230
It has to be done carefully,or
it could leave a scar.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.000
A scar?

24:31.690 --> 24:35.480
We can take youto a plastic surgeon
to have it removed,if you want.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.940
I want it out now,please.

24:39.030 --> 24:40.800
Okay.Let's do it.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.980
Here's the packet.

24:46.830 --> 24:48.060
Gloves.

24:48.140 --> 24:49.100
Is it gonna hurt?

24:49.150 --> 24:53.030
Just when I put inthe anesthetic.Then
you'll be fine.You won't feel a thing.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.060
Swab.

24:58.250 --> 25:00.500
Okay.Lidocaine.

25:01.070 --> 25:03.230
You're gonna feela little pressure.

25:08.390 --> 25:10.490
And nowyou won't feel a thing.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.840
15 blade.

25:24.870 --> 25:26.930
Okay,dab it with the gauze.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.940
Clear the area.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.120
What the hell is that?

25:40.190 --> 25:41.900
It's nota medical instrument.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.360
This part lookslike an antenna.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.600
What,it's receivinginformation?

25:46.660 --> 25:48.480
Or sending.

25:48.540 --> 25:49.730
What?

25:49.800 --> 25:54.060
Am I crazy,or is thisa tracking device?

25:58.440 --> 26:00.490
What do you know about this?

26:00.660 --> 26:02.590
Nothing.What is it?

26:02.660 --> 26:05.420
A piece of metalthat
almost killed your wife.

26:05.490 --> 26:07.620
What?

26:07.730 --> 26:09.680
It was supposed to becompletely safe.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.080
Yeah,not when you put
itinside a magnet 50,000 times

26:12.140 --> 26:14.430
more powerfulthan the
earth's magnetic field.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.930
We're lucky it didn't
rupturea major organ.

26:16.970 --> 26:20.360
Just one of the safety hazards when you
implant metalin someone without their consent.

26:20.420 --> 26:23.150
I asked the surgeonto put in the
gps,but he said she'd be fine.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.430
He said she'd never find out.

26:25.490 --> 26:28.670
Well,sure.Otherwise putting a gpsin your
wife's implant would just seem crazy.

26:28.730 --> 26:30.270
You must understand.

26:30.330 --> 26:33.760
Haven't you ever doneanything
foolish for a woman?

26:36.290 --> 26:38.830
Are there any other
foreignobjects inside your wife?

26:38.890 --> 26:40.960
Of course not.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.180
Can I see her?

26:44.340 --> 26:46.730
I'd give hersome space right now.

26:50.790 --> 26:53.850
***

27:00.330 --> 27:02.870
Did she say anything
aboutpressing charges against him?

27:02.940 --> 27:04.070
No.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.840
She mostly said,"why me?Why me?

27:08.800 --> 27:10.500
" Listen,you've been here a while.

27:10.570 --> 27:14.630
I'll stay with sofia,watch her mental state,keep
an eye on her vitalsfor signs of bleeding,

27:14.730 --> 27:17.050
update my facebook statusto
"is watching patient.

27:17.110 --> 27:18.620
" I can stay.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.010
You don't have any plans?

27:20.120 --> 27:21.570
Nothing I can't bump.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.360
- We should set her upwith fluids.
- Already done.

27:24.530 --> 27:27.030
- You sure you want to stay?
- Yes.Go.

27:27.100 --> 27:30.000
We'll be fine,sofia and me.

27:30.090 --> 27:31.350
Okay.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.510
Um,see you later.

27:59.270 --> 28:02.420
Well,if you're gonnaget kicked out of
your house,you may as wellget kicked here.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.930
I feel like sofiais
slipping out of my hands.

28:06.010 --> 28:07.670
Really?Well,I can relateto that feeling.

28:07.730 --> 28:09.990
It's exactly how I
feelabout your payment.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.530
That credit card you
gave medeclined,my friend.

28:12.570 --> 28:15.050
I'll get you the money,somehow.

28:15.110 --> 28:20.340
Okay,so either they gotthe upholstery
wrong on your caras well as your couch,

28:20.420 --> 28:22.450
or they both got repossessed.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.750
So what's going on,man?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.790
Truth comes out.

28:28.050 --> 28:31.240
I am very nearly broke.

28:31.830 --> 28:33.150
How did that happen?

28:33.210 --> 28:37.100
I invested emotionally,and
I lost millions.

28:37.170 --> 28:38.690
I can't believethis is happening to me.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.000
Now I lose sofia too.

28:41.050 --> 28:44.340
She grew up with nothing.She'll
never goback to that life.

28:44.660 --> 28:48.010
Once she finds out,she'll find
a manwho can provide for her,

28:48.060 --> 28:52.070
a man who investswith
his mind,not his heart.

28:55.260 --> 28:59.590
Well,I hope you don't planto use
that misery knife thing on anyone.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.700
I'm sellingmy personal collection.

29:01.750 --> 29:03.710
It's the only wayto keep sofia.

29:03.760 --> 29:07.700
Wait,you're selling off assets to pay
for your wife'scrazy shopping sprees?

29:07.740 --> 29:10.410
Why don't you just tell her that
you can't afford themanymore?

29:11.610 --> 29:14.120
This will coverour medical bill.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.150
Why?How much is it worth?

29:16.220 --> 29:17.740
More than the bill.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.640
Please.Take it.

29:29.320 --> 29:33.040
I'll tell you what at the
riskof sounding immodest,

29:33.100 --> 29:35.860
I was a wildly successfulaccountant
back in new york,

29:35.920 --> 29:38.570
so how about I throw in,like,

29:38.610 --> 29:42.660
a free financial checkupand tax
consultation to make up the difference?

29:47.500 --> 29:49.290
Cool.

29:51.050 --> 29:57.210
I have the power.Oh,god.Awesome.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.340
Okay.

30:08.450 --> 30:09.540
Hank.

30:09.620 --> 30:12.300
So I got the resultson your
blood work.Everything looks great.

30:12.380 --> 30:13.660
Nothing abnormal,then?

30:13.780 --> 30:18.240
Uh,well,your cpkis slightly elevated,but
that's no real causefor concern.

30:18.580 --> 30:21.240
- Creatinine phosphokinase
- yes.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.110
But that can spikefrom
an intense workout,

30:23.200 --> 30:26.390
and you have no other
factorsindicating muscle damage.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.330
May I have this printout?

30:28.430 --> 30:30.280
Yeah.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.840
Yeah,hi.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.860
Um,this is hank lawson.

30:49.350 --> 30:52.920
Yes,I got the cbc,but I need you to
do a fullkitchen sink on that blood

30:52.960 --> 30:54.750
and put a rush on it.

30:54.810 --> 30:56.760
Thanks.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.420
Hey,divya,what's up?

31:02.510 --> 31:03.750
Is she still havingtrouble breathing?

31:03.820 --> 31:07.110
I did an xray,and it's not
leftover metalcausing irritation.

31:07.210 --> 31:09.580
You won't believe it.Take a look.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.610
Were the others like this?

31:10.700 --> 31:12.230
All justas cloudy as this one.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.180
Right.We need to get herto the hospital.

31:14.250 --> 31:17.620
Call the E.R.,Let them knowwhat we're bringing
in,and have them arrangefor an isolation room.

31:17.690 --> 31:20.190
Sofia's going to take thisvery badly.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.550
In case you haven't noticed,she
can be rather dramatic.

31:22.590 --> 31:25.770
Yeah,I'd be too,if I found
outI had radiation poisoning.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.040
Plutonium?

31:29.110 --> 31:33.080
I know it sounds scary,but it's a minimal amount.The
tracking device must haveused an old pacemaker battery.

31:33.140 --> 31:35.070
It cracked in the accidentand
leaked into your body.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.080
Dr.Lawson.

31:36.140 --> 31:39.790
Her radiation exposurewas internal.Her incision
needs to bereopened for gross debridement.

31:39.870 --> 31:41.380
- What about your exposure?
- I handled the device.

31:41.450 --> 31:44.570
None of us have symptoms,but you
should still sweep me,just in case.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.780
You're clear.

31:47.860 --> 31:51.220
She's a live one,but it's
localized.Come on,let's get her inside.

31:51.290 --> 31:53.350
Let's go.Let's go,guys.

31:54.460 --> 31:58.040
You're the perfect excuse to
avoid anothervendingmachine meal.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.040
You want to grab lunchin the caf?

32:00.110 --> 32:00.970
I can'T.

32:01.060 --> 32:03.330
I'm going backto the marine institute.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.460
Why?Did boris back out?

32:05.490 --> 32:06.960
No,I did.

32:06.990 --> 32:09.800
He called me this morning with
a complete changeof objectives

32:09.850 --> 32:11.990
and a pretty unrealistictime table.

32:12.050 --> 32:14.460
I never quite knowwhat's
going on with that guy.

32:14.540 --> 32:16.820
So what does that mean?

32:16.910 --> 32:19.840
Well,I can't talk about it,as
much as I'd love to,believe me.

32:19.890 --> 32:22.780
Yeah,but,katie,this
is your dream project.

32:22.820 --> 32:24.300
Yeah,not boris' way.

32:24.350 --> 32:27.160
I'm not just gonna proceedwith my
eyes closed and fingers crossed.

32:27.210 --> 32:31.620
I can't do that.And
P.S.,Neither should you.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.240
You think I'm doing it again.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.120
Hey,I get it.Hank's nice,charming,cute.

32:36.190 --> 32:38.530
And you thinkhe's only
here for the summer.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.570
You saw the look on his
facewhen I asked him.

32:40.630 --> 32:42.740
Jill,it's the same
storysince seventh grade.

32:42.850 --> 32:44.910
I mean,you married a
guywho couldn't stay put.

32:44.970 --> 32:49.920
Yeah,but we're notin seventh grade
anymore,and hank's not charlie.

32:49.990 --> 32:52.730
He's different.

32:53.330 --> 32:54.910
Shouldn't I trust my instincts?

32:55.010 --> 32:57.770
If history's taught usanything,it's
thatwhen it comes to guys,

32:57.810 --> 33:01.430
whatever your instincts
say,do the opposite.

33:01.750 --> 33:04.110
So what are you saying?

33:04.180 --> 33:07.420
I'm sayingI don't want to see
you get your heart broken again.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.200
Hank.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.560
Welcome back.How are you feeling?

33:17.640 --> 33:18.990
Is the radiation gone?

33:19.080 --> 33:23.540
Completely.The surgeonscleaned up the wound,and
the chelation therapyis taking care of the rest.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.820
Luckily,we caught it
early,minimizing your exposure.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.220
Can I come in?

33:33.580 --> 33:36.090
I swear,I didn't
knowthat thing was poison.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.200
I was just so afraidof losing you.

33:38.270 --> 33:41.800
I can't believeyou
did that to me,javier.

33:41.910 --> 33:45.110
I had no ideayou loved me so much.

33:47.880 --> 33:53.250
Look,mi amor,I have to tell
you the truth about the money.

33:53.330 --> 33:57.200
I don't care about the money,just you.

33:57.380 --> 33:59.920
Let's go back to caracas.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.650
Uh,we should go.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.239
Please.

34:14.010 --> 34:17.010
- What happened in caracas...
- should have stayedin caracas.

34:22.850 --> 34:24.389
Katie.

34:24.489 --> 34:26.280
- Hank.
- Evan told me you're leaving.

34:26.389 --> 34:28.190
He washe was really bummedabout it.

34:28.250 --> 34:31.239
Yeah,so am I.That's not
whyyou're here,though.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.050
You're right.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.540
What exactly were you
gonna dowith that shark?

34:35.620 --> 34:40.040
Well,my plan was to studythe immune
system,tcell differentiation,stuff like that.

34:40.389 --> 34:42.460
So what did boris changehis mind about?

34:42.560 --> 34:45.790
Sorry.He had me signa
confidentiality agreement.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.159
Well,just out of curiosity...

34:50.060 --> 34:54.469
are there anyhuman medical
implications to your research?

34:54.830 --> 34:56.510
Not yet.

34:56.600 --> 35:00.510
But let's just say there area few prominent
geneticists closely following these studies.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.960
I should go.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.180
You're lucky,you know.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.340
Jill's a catch.

35:10.460 --> 35:13.190
- Yeah,I know she
- you better not hurt her.
